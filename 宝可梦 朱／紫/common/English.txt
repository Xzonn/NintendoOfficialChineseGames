original_book_title_01_01	The Legendary Treasure
original_book_honbun_01_01	Countless days into our descent,\nwe reached at last the very depths of\nthe Great Crater. There we found a\ncave with formations of gemstone,\nshining blindingly bright as far as we\ncould see. Perhaps that strange light\nitself is the guardian said to watch\nover treasure deep within the crater.
original_book_title_02_01_A	Monsters of Area Zero
original_book_honbun_02_01_A	As we descended further into Area\nZero, we began to catch glimpses\nof mysterious Pokémon—though we\nwondered if these huge, ferocious\nbeasts were indeed Pokémon at all.\nOne of our team suffered a brutal\nblow from such a beast and was\nmortally wounded, forcing us to\nretreat for a time.
original_book_title_02_02_A	Monsters of Area Zero
original_book_honbun_02_02_A	A member of the survey team\ncaptured this photograph by chance.\nI notice a passing resemblance to\nthe Pokémon known as Donphan,\nyet differences such as its sheer\nsize and the shape of its back set\nit apart—as do its great tusks.
original_book_title_02_01_B	Monsters of Area Zero
original_book_honbun_02_01_B	As we descended further into Area\nZero, we began to catch glimpses\nof mysterious Pokémon—though we\nwondered if these compact, cruel\nbeasts were indeed Pokémon at all.\nOne of our team suffered a brutal\nblow from such a beast and was\nmortally wounded, forcing us to\nretreat for a time.
original_book_title_02_02_B	Monsters of Area Zero
original_book_honbun_02_02_B	A member of the survey team\ncaptured this photograph by chance.\nI notice a passing resemblance to\nthe Pokémon known as Donphan,\nyet differences such as its texture\nand the way it moves suggest it is\nbiologically separate—to say nothing\nof its treads of iron.
original_book_title_03_01	The Great Crater of Paldea
original_book_honbun_03_01	A photograph from the survey team’s\npoint of ingress to the crater, which\nis visible in the background. Luck\nfavored us with fine weather, making\nfor a smooth outset. But clouds\nobscured the crater’s distant depths,\nwhere the treasure of legend is said\nto lie. Now, onward and downward.
original_book_title_04_01	Area Zero: Cartograph
original_book_honbun_04_01	Ledges form a spiral down the inner\nwalls of Area Zero, offering a path\nof descent. Vegetation and sources\nof water are here as well. Legends\ntell that precious stones or wondrous\nfruits have long slept in Area Zero’s\ndepths, protected by some manner\nof guardian.

original_book_title_06_01	The Adventure into Area Zero
original_book_honbun_06_01	Within the Great Crater of Paldea\nlies the mysterious Area Zero—a\nplace home to such landscapes, such\nplant life, and such Pokémon as we\nhad never seen. It is inhospitable to\nhuman life, and as such, I suspect\nsomething altogether unknown to\nhumankind sleeps in its depths.
original_book_title_06_02	The Adventure into Area Zero
original_book_honbun_06_02	A photograph of a spot where the\nsurvey team rested on day two of\nthe expedition. Note the strange\nsymbols inscribed in the ground\nhere—were they left by explorers in\nthe time of the Paldean Empire, or\ncould they be older still? Regardless,\nthey seemed as if they must hold\nsome meaning.
original_book_title_07_01	Pokémon of Area Zero
original_book_honbun_07_01	Sketches by a survey team member.\n\nSurprisingly, the Pokémon species we\nobserved in the upper strata of Area\nZero seemed little different from\nthose seen outside the crater.\n\nNow and then, we heard unfamiliar\ncries from the lower strata.

original_book_title_09_01	Mysterious Plates
original_book_honbun_09_01	During our descent into Area Zero,\nwe came across a buried metal plate\ninscribed with a strange symbol. We\nattempted to shave off a piece of\nthe plate but failed to leave even a\nscratch. Even determining the nature\nof the metal seems beyond modern\nscience. We know not why the\ninscription was made, let alone how.
original_book_title_10_01	Herba Mystica
original_book_honbun_10_01	Area Zero was home to wondrous\nherbs that instantly impart vigor\nwhen eaten. We dubbed them Herba\nMystica and attempted to grow some\nin areas around Paldea. However,\nbefore we could harvest, the\nherbs were eaten by Pokémon—\nwhich in turn grew large and strong.\nWe call these Titan Pokémon.

original_book_title_13_01	A Phantom Memory
original_book_honbun_13_01	During our exploration of Area\nZero’s depths, I—Heath—strayed\nfrom the team and was later found\nunconscious. When awoken, I could\nonly recall speaking with someone in\nan unfamiliar place, as if in a dream.\nI was found holding the page shown\nhere. The handwriting is my own, but\nI have no memory of writing this.

TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	If you talk to a Pokémon Trainer like me, it means\nwe’re gonna battle!
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your Pokémon are strong, huh!
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Here in Paldea, you gotta talk to a Pokémon\nTrainer to challenge ’em. We can’t tell if you\r\nwanna battle just by making eye contact!
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Got my Pokémon\nall healed up! ▶

TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_TANPAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Lemme show you this awesome-lookin’ Pokémon\nI just caught!
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_TANPAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I guess just looking cool doesn’t cut it.
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_TANPAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I caught my Chewtle pretty close to a pond.\nMaybe Water types like hanging out near water...

TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_WORKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m gonna defeat you so my Pokémon can get\neven tougher!
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_WORKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Maybe my Pokémon’s level isn’t high enough...

TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_CLEANING_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Heading to school? ▶

TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Pop quiz! What happens when a Pokémon’s HP\nruns out?
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The answer is, as you can see...they get too\nexhausted to fight!
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	When a Pokémon loses all its HP and faints, you\ncan’t make it better with a Potion. You’ve got to\r\ntake it to a Pokémon Center!
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Guess this is it? ▶
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I came to Mesagoza to make some deliveries...\nbut let’s have a quick battle!
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Guess I delivered you a win!
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Mesagoza’s so massive, it’s easy to get lost if you\ndon’t check your map app.
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	That door was\nso weird... ▶
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I can’t stop wondering what’s behind that weird\ndoor, or lid, or cover, or whatever it was...\c\nMaybe a battle will take my mind off it!
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Just what could be behind that— Whoa, wait,\nI lost?!
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	In a rock face past here, there’s a door or lid or\nsomething that’s chained shut!\c\nThere was a faint light coming through it. I\nwonder what could be in there...
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I’m the strongest in Area One\nof the South Province! ▶
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Do you think you can topple me—the mightiest\nmartial artist here?!
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Very well! Henceforth, I am the second mightiest!
TRID_AREA01_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I wonder if there are people even stronger than\nus outside Area One of the South Province...

TRID_AREA03_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m makin’ my way to the Pokémon League! Let’s\nbattle to mark the occasion!
TRID_AREA03_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Well, losing’s one way to mark an occasion!
TRID_AREA03_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I don’t have any Gym Badges yet, but maybe I’ll\nsit for the interview and see if I pass anyway...
TRID_AREA03_TRAINER_TAXIDRIVER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Takin’ on the League? ▶
TRID_AREA03_TRAINER_TAXIDRIVER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You look like you’ve got promise, kid. Let’s give\nyou a challenge to grow on!
TRID_AREA03_TRAINER_TAXIDRIVER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hahaha! Did you get some growth out of that?
TRID_AREA03_TRAINER_TAXIDRIVER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If battling me helps you grow stronger and you\nbecome a Champion one day, that means I’m a\r\npart of what made you a Champion! Right?
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Rrrgh! I’m so careless! ▶
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I can’t believe I forgot to buy ingredients! Maybe\na rumble will calm my rumbling tummy!
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Rrrgh. I’m so disappointed.
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I was really excited to have a picnic, make a\nsandwich, and eat it with my Pokémon...
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_CHEF_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Hey, you there! ▶
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_CHEF_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I hope you’re getting enough to eat!
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_CHEF_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Good! You seem well!

TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Gonna train up my bug\nPokémon real strong! ▶
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m out getting my bug Pokémon a lot of\nexperience!
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Aww, I bet I coulda beat you if I’d evolved my\nPokémon...
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I hear bug Pokémon evolve quicker than other\nPokémon! Maybe my Kricketot will evolve soon...
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Have you seen the\nTen Sights of Paldea? ▶
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Want to know the way to one of the Ten Sights\nof Paldea?!
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	This is a sight I’ve never seen!
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The Grand Olive Orchard, one of the Ten Sights\nof Paldea, is a little past that Pokémon Center!\r\nJust follow the path—you can’t miss it.
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	What a haul! ▶
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I collected a ton of materials Pokémon dropped.\nNow I think I’ll start collecting some prize money!
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Fine, you can have some prize money... But you\ncan’t have my materials!
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I need to make some TMs. That’s why I was out\ngathering materials that Pokémon drop.
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Which way to the Gym? ▶
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Check me out—I’m 60 and still kickin’! I’m even\noff to take on a Gym!
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Check me out—I’m 60 and getting beat before\nI even get to the Gym...
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	My daughter keeps telling me, “If you get lost,\npress the Y Button to check your map app!”\r\nMap app? Sounds like claptrap to me...
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I wanna catch ’em! ▶
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Could I catch the Pokémon you trained?\nPleeease, could I?
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Guess you can’t catch people’s Pokémon...
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I don’t want to be a thief! I’ll just catch wild\nPokémon.
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Please tell me the way! ▶
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Where am I supposed to go from here? I haven’t\ngot a clue—I’m just aimlessly wandering...
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Was losing to you supposed to help me find\nmy way?!
TRID_AREA04_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If you get lost and don’t know where to go, like\nme...try asking at the Pokémon Center.

TRID_AREA08_TRAINER_ARTIST_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Battle... Art... Both are fiendishly tough pursuits!
TRID_AREA08_TRAINER_ARTIST_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I still need to find a model for my next piece.\nPreferably someone I can beat.
TRID_AREA08_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	It’s all about balance! ▶
TRID_AREA08_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve got Pokémon of a bunch of different types,\nso we can have a well-balanced battle!
TRID_AREA08_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Agh! Now I’m off-balance!
TRID_AREA08_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Having different types of Pokémon with you\nshould help you handle different situations!
TRID_AREA08_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	The Treasure Hunt\nis so much fun! ▶
TRID_AREA08_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m doing the Treasure Hunt, too. And no fresh-\nfaced kid is gonna beat me!

TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What?! Wait, does this mean I have to go?!
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It’s tough getting all the way up here to our\nsecret base, huh?
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Scrub-a-dub! ▶
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Are you washing your Pokémon nice and clean?
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I got washed away!
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Area Four of the South Province is a big place—\nplenty of room for a thorough Pokémon washing!\r\nA little of that fresh feeling goes a long way!
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Begging your pardon... ▶
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Begging your pardon... Could I trouble you for\na battle?
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m begging your par-done for!
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I guess in those old-timey shows, when people\nbeg someone’s pardon, they’re usually asking for\r\nhelp or directions or something, not a battle.
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I’ve covered up\nmy weakness! ▶
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	This Berry is my ace in the hole! It’s covered up\nmy weakness!
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Even with one less weakness, I lost...
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	There’re some Berries that Pokémon can hold to\ntake less damage from a supereffective move.\r\nGives you one less thing to worry about!
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Treasure ahoy! ▶
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I know where there’s treasure! Maaaybe I’ll tell\nyou...if you can beat me!
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The real treasure was definitely not meeting you!
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I saw a treasure chest up on top of that tower!\nBut it started moving around on its own, so I, uh,\r\ngot kinda freaked out and didn’t open it...

TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I don’t love battles quite as much.
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Your Pokédex will tell you where Pokémon’s\nhabitats are and when you might find them!
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I wanna see! ▶
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I wanna see the cute li’l Pokémon you’ve got\nwith you!

TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Is this a dead end? ▶
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	It feels like such a waste to hit a dead end and\njust turn back with nothing to show. So...shall we?
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I should have just turned back...
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If I just had a way to ride a Pokémon up cliffs,\nI could get to the South Province’s Area Six...
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_KARATE_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Excuse me! ▶
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_KARATE_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Let’s get down to it. Please forgive my being\nbarefoot.
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_KARATE_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Perhaps I’d have had a chance if I’d been\nwearing boots...
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_KARATE_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I know other Black Belts go around barefoot...\nDo rocks and things just not hurt them?
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Are these Pokémon\njust too strong? ▶
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Is it me, or are the Pokémon around here way too\nstrong? We should probably turn back, huh?
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I guess I’d be fine out here if I were as strong as\nyou are.
TRID_AREA05_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Beating stronger Pokémon makes you stronger in\nturn, but that only works if you can actually win...
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Two whole decades! ▶
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve got twenty years of studies at the academy\nunder my belt!
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Twenty years...for this...
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I was so short on credits I had to take a 20th\nyear! Maybe it’s time I graduated...
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	If you shorten pants... ▶
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	If you shorten pants, do you get a pan?
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Now I’ve got short pants, but a long face...
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Would you say you’re more of a shorts person or\na pants person?
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	How about it? ▶
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	How about a nice Pokémon battle? I’ve got some\nspare time and I’d like to do something fun!
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Ahhh, that was fun.
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Some moves look cool, some moves hit hard...but\nmy favorites are the ones that are just plain fun.
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Do you know of Kofu? ▶
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Kofu, the Cascarrafa Gym Leader, is quite strong!
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I guess now you know how strong I am!
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Kofu is a user of water Pokémon! Take care lest\nyou be swept away by his strategy!
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	The Great Crater\nof Paldea... ▶
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Why is the Great Crater of Paldea off-limits,\nI wonder?
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Guess if a kid can beat me, I’m better off not\ngoing anywhere dangerous...
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I heard the depths of the Great Crater of Paldea\nare defended by a super-powerful guardian!
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I’ve got a guitar... ▶
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve got a guitar that doesn’t make a sound!
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m as victorious as my guitar is loud...
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Sometimes I carry around my silent guitar to\ntoughen up my arms and neck!
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	The joy of youth! ▶
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	What is youth, though? Do you have an answer?
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Aaah, the folly of youth...
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Maybe you only really understand your youth\nwhen you look back on it as an adult.
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	A weird Pokémon! ▶
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	There was a weird Pokémon! There was a weird\nPokémon!
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I saw a weird Pokémon, I swear! I’ll tell you more\nin a bit!
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I ran into a weird Pokémon out in the desert.\c\nIt looked like Donphan, but I think it actually\nwas a different Pokémon...
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	So much sand! ▶
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	What d’you think will happen if sand gets into\nmy shoes?
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Maybe I’ll just go bury my head in the sand!
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If the sand stays inside my shoes for too long,\nI start to grow fond of it!
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_KARATE_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Yooo-hooo! ▶
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_KARATE_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Yaaa! Huagh?! Hey, how’d you get up here?!
TRID_AREA10_TRAINER_KARATE_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oooh, by riding your Pokémon!

TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_WORKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m a worker! If you need work done, I’m\nyour man!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_WORKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Pokémon battles aren’t work!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_WORKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Workers like me can build any kind of building,\nwhether it’s a school or the Pokémon League HQ!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Teach me! ▶
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Teach me! Teach me the feeling of defeat!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	So this is what defeat feels like!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Defeat’s really something else. Thanks for\nteaching me!

TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_CLEANING_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’ve cleaned me out!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_CLEANING_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	No matter how messy battles get, I love to\nsee them!

TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	A superstrong girl asked me to battle! I lost\nbefore I could even blink!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	And now I lost to you, too!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	That superstrong girl... She had to be Champion\nRank. No doubt about it.
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Rarrr! Raaarrrr! ▶
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Do you wanna see my super cool Pokémon\nfigurines?
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Grrryaaa! Craaash! I lost!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare super neat! If they ever make\n[VAR 1101(00FD,0E0E)]a figure of itfigures of ’em, you bet I’ll collect [VAR 1101(00FD,0C01)]ithe whole set!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	It doesn’t matter. ▶
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	It doesn’t matter how old you are if your\nPokémon are strong.
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re strong! And young!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	With Pokémon, a child can defeat an adult!\nThat’s what makes it so fun!

TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Where did you\ncome from? ▶
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Oh, you’re from Cabo Poco? I’m from\nMontenevera!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I was representing Montenevera but I still lost...
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The snow in Montenevera is gorgeous! And we\nhave a beautiful concert stage too!\c\nI bet Cabo Poco doesn’t have all that!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Which do you like? ▶
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Do you like studying in the classroom? Or do you\nlike adventuring in the wild?
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Well, I can tell you definitely like Pokémon.
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Me, I prefer to stay in my classroom and study!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_KARATE_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Hoo hah! ▶
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_KARATE_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hoo hah! Hoo hah!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_KARATE_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I guess just shouting wasn’t enough to win.
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_KARATE_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Hoo hah!\nI tried copying the shouts of a martial artist I\r\nlook up to, but I couldn’t win anyway.
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_MANIA_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Monsters! ▶
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_MANIA_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I love Pokémon that are like the monsters\nin movies!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_MANIA_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I can’t believe my monster was defeated!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_MANIA_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	In the movies, the monsters always lose. But in\nreal life I’d like them to win!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_WAITRESS_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I want to protect\nthis beach. ▶
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_WAITRESS_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hey, did I just catch you littering?! I need to\nbattle you to protect the beach!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_WAITRESS_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Sorry about that... Seems like I was mistaken.
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_WAITRESS_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	This is the Secluded Beach, one of the Ten\nSights of Paldea.\c\nIt’s not so secluded anymore, what with all the\nattention it’s gotten as a tourist location...

TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I need your help! ▶
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I need a real workout!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Now that was a good workout! I was sweating\na ton!
TRID_AREA07_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Pokémon battles are great exercise for the\nTrainers, too! It’s just the best!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	... ... ... ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	...Let’s battle.
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	...You’re strong.
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	That was fun... Bye...
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Where’s Alfornada? ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Let’s have a battle. It’ll help me feel less alone\nand lost.
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I lost. This does nothing to help my anxiety.
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Supposedly, I can reach Alfornada if I just follow\nthe road, but...is this even a road...?
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	What a great view! ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I wanna get a selfie of me beating you with this\ngorgeous view as a backdrop!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	A selfie of my defeat, huh?
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I wanted a selfie so I could use it for my icon\non my profile!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Focus! Gotta focus! ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I lost at the Alfornada Gym so I’m doing some\nmore training.
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Yet another defeat!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Tulip, the Alfornada Gym Leader, is a skilled\nTrainer of Psychic-type Pokémon.\c\nMy Fighting-type Pokémon didn’t stand\na chance...
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Putting my trained\nlegs to use! ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	One! Two!\nOne! Two!\c\nI trained using the torturously long staircase in\nfront of the school!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I wish training my legs also made my Pokémon\nstronger.
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	That staircase in front of the school sure is\nridiculously long, isn’t it?\c\nYou can catch the student council president\nsitting down for a breather from time to time.
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_WORKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I’m so worried! ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_WORKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	A child, out all on your own? Why, you have me\nworried sick! I’ve got to get you back to town!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_WORKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, well, if you’re that strong, I suppose I\nneedn’t worry.
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_WORKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Watch out for dangerous Pokémon and strange\npeople, OK?
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	This slope is awesome! ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	This is an absolute paradise for us hikers!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	It’s like I’m climbing into the sky!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Flat paths are so boring. Just like life, you gotta\nhave peaks and valleys!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Your future is hazy. ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Let me see your future. Let’s see if you’ll make it\nout of this cave!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’ll be fine wherever you go...
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Alfornada is ahead, after you climb this cave\never upward.\c\nFollow the torches. They will be your guide.
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Where am I? ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I was running after Pokémon and...now I’m\ncompletely lost!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Lost my way to victory too...
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_TANPAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If I really get stumped, I’ll call a Flying Taxi.
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Whew... Just a\nlittle more... ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I swore to myself that I’d make my way to town\nwithout riding on my Pokémon.
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My legs are about to give out, and I’m about to\ngive up...
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I guess it’s a good time for a breather! And I’ve\ngot some sandwiches for my Pokémon!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	This is so much fun! ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Treasure hunting is so much fun! And it’ll be even\nmore fun when I beat you!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Losing isn’t fun!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	This Treasure Hunt project is fun, isn’t it?\c\nIt’s a great chance to really reexamine yourself!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Gotta remember\nPokémon types... ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Pokémon types are so complicated, don’t\nyou think?
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Not complicated for you, huh?
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	OK, so I get why Water is strong against Fire...\nBut why is Dark strong against Psychic?
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	So much work! ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	*huff* *puff*\nIt’s so much work to get to town from here!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I bet I’d have won if I wasn’t so tired.
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I wish they’d give me a bonus for each delivery\nI make to Alfornada.
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Did I see you riding\non a Pokémon? ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I didn’t know there was a Pokémon that could\nclimb these steep slopes with a rider...
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I thought I’d trained pretty hard...
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Such a mysterious Pokémon... I’ve never seen\nanything like it!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_DELIVERER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Behold these muscles! ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_DELIVERER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I built up these muscles by many trips to the gym!\nMy brilliant brawn will surely lead me to victory!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_DELIVERER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My massive musculature misled me!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_DELIVERER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The gym I go to isn’t a Pokémon Gym, you know!\nIt’s a human gym!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	How does today’s\nweather look? ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ll tell you why I’m so worried about the weather!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Sandstorms are weather too, you know!\n...I swear! They are!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The truly frightening thing about a sandstorm is\nnot the damage it deals...\c\nit’s the fact that Rock-type Pokémon get a\nSp. Def boost and become even hardier!
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	’Scuse me! ▶
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Wouldja be so kind as to battle me? As, like,\ncelebration for reaching Alfornada?
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wait...this isn’t Alfornada?
TRID_AREA06_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You’re saying Alfornada is beyond Alfornada\nCavern...? I need to climb even more?!
TRID_AREA13_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Map says it’s around\nhere somewhere... ▶
TRID_AREA13_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You wouldn’t happen to know the address for the\nTeam Star Poison crew’s base, would you?
TRID_AREA13_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I misread the map, and I misread the course of\nthat battle!
TRID_AREA13_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It seems like Team Star’s Poison crew set up their\nbase across the river.
TRID_AREA13_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Gotta study hard! ▶
TRID_AREA13_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hey, aren’t you a student?! You should be at\nschool!
TRID_AREA13_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You schooled me!
TRID_AREA13_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You should go back to the academy now and\nthen to attend class. You’ll learn a lot!
TRID_AREA13_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	What colorful trees... ▶
TRID_AREA13_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Do you know why these trees have so many\ncolors on them?
TRID_AREA13_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Waaaaaah! Now I’m all bluuueee!
TRID_AREA13_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The colorful markings on these trees were\npainted by a Pokémon called Grafaiai.\r\nThat Pokémon is a real artist. Just like me!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Heeey, you wanna\nbuy this? ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Oh ho ho! You bought it—my fake out, that is!\nNow it’s battle time!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That little joke really cost me!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Did you know that shops will buy your items? But\nyou’ll only get a quarter what you’d pay for ’em.\c\nIf you want to make money, sell items like\nNuggets—that’s really all they’re good for!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_WORKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Ahhh, Steel-type Pokémon! ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_WORKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ll show you how strong and sturdy Steel-type\nPokémon can be!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_WORKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Did you already know how to get around\nSteel-type Pokémon’s sturdy strength?
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_WORKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Steel types don’t have all that many weaknesses,\nand they can’t be poisoned!\c\nThey get KAPOW’ed by Fighting-type moves,\nthough...plus Fire-type moves melt them down!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_WORKER_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	This is Area Three of\nthe East Province! ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_WORKER_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Area Three of the East Province is a mining belt!\nWe dig, dig, dig for metals!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_WORKER_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I see you’re no stranger to hard work!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_WORKER_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Maybe this is a good time for me to head back\nto Zapapico and rest up!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	So, about those mines... ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Do you think people can go hiking in mines?
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I guess you wouldn’t know, huh?
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	No matter the reason, kids like you should stay\noutta mines! You’re a minor, not a miner!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	My Pokémon!\nIt evooolved! ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Want to help my newly evolved Pokémon with\nsome target practice?
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My Pokémon’s so newly evolved, it doesn’t\nknow how to battle!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It’s amazing how Magikarp evolves into Gyarados.\nI wish I could evolve into a Pokémon, too...
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Ptooey! Blech... ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	There’s so much sand around here, my mouth’s\ngetting all gritty...
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What, the battle’s over? I was still spitting\nout sand...
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Even sandstorms won’t give you any trouble if\nyou’ve got Safety Goggles in hand!\r\nThe sand will still get in your mouth though!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Harsh landscapes\nare the best! ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Harsh landscapes like this are the best for\ngood-quality training!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	So harsh!!!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	What would happen if I trained on a tropical\nbeach instead? Would it be...not very effective?
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Gosh, it was amazing! ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Oh my gosh, I saw something amazing! Wanna\nknow what it was?
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I saw an amaaazing Pokémon right here!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	A huuuge Pokémon like one of those big towers\nin Levincia came right out of the ground!\c\nIt looked just like the giant Diglett statues they\nhave in some other region!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Ah, sad songs... ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Are you a fan of sad songs? Or not so much?\nMy personal opinion is...they’re OK, I guess!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	It’s a sad, sad loss in a sad, sad world. ♪\nTra la la laaa. ♪
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Just a theory of mine, but I think cheery people\ntend to be more fond of sad songs!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Tick-tock-tick-tock. ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Come on! Let’s have a battle of luck!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Is your luck good? Or is mine just bad?
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Metronome is a move that leaves everything to\nluck! So it wasn’t my skill that failed me.
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Let’s talk about me! ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hey! Don’t you think I’m awful cute?
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I wish you’d show a little more respect for my\ncuteness.
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Maybe I should have spent more time making my\nPokémon really cute?
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I’ll see if you’re worthy. ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Are you a student, child? Allow me to test your\nabilities!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That was conceited of me...
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	My apologies. You were the superior Trainer.
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	You got moxie, kid? ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I want to battle someone with serious moxie! Are\nyou that someone?
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You outmoxied me!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	That was the best battle I’ve had in a while!\nThanks for talking to me, kid!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Everything here’s\nso rugged... ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Seems rough and rugged places like this attract\na lot of hardy Pokémon, huh?
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wow! The Trainers are hardy, too!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If I want to find soft, fluffy Pokémon, should I\nlook in a flower meadow or something?
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Hey! Hold up,\nwould you? ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Tagtree Thicket up ahead isn’t safe—you’ll run\ninto a bunch of delinquents.
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wow, you’re strong. I guess you didn’t need\nmy advice!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	They’re from a group called Team Star? People\nsay they’re delinquents, right? Not that they’ve\r\ndone anything to me, mind you, but still...
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	What Pokémon do\nyou think I’ll use? ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Did you talk to me because you thought I’d use\nDragon-type Pokémon?
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You were right! It’s dragons all the way!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Maybe this outfit isn’t doing me any good.\nEveryone can tell which type I’ll be using...
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_WORKER_4_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Any day now! ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_WORKER_4_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My baby is due any day now! I gotta get serious!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_WORKER_4_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I wish I could’ve gotten a bit more serious in\nthat battle!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_WORKER_4_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	When my kid is old enough, I’ll be sure to send\nthem to the same school you go to!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	According to my\ncalculations... ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I calculated it all, and I knew the likelihood you’d\ncome talk to me was 100 percent!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I failed to calculate my chances of winning...
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Do you have lessons with Ms. Tyme?\nThey’re really fun if you love math!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	He loves me...\nHe loves me not... ▶
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	If I beat you, I’m gonna tell my crush how I feel!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I lost! Oh, thank goodness!
TRID_AREA14_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	At this rate, I’ll always be holding back on\nmaking any decisive moves...
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	In cold places\nlike this... ▶
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	In cold places like this, my life gets a bit easier!
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Only my deliveries get easier, you know!\nBattling’s as tough as always!
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The food I’m delivering doesn’t spoil when it’s\ncold out. For once, I’m not rushed off my feet!
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Ah... Aaah! ▶

TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I heard that Ryme, the world-famous rapper, is\nhaving a concert over in Montenevera!
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m gonna miss the concert!
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Don’t tell me...Montenevera is on the OTHER\nside of the mountain?
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	You heard of the\nSnow Slope Run? ▶
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I traveled a long way to get here so I could\ntry my hand at the Snow Slope Run.
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Battling is also a slippery slope.
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	For my Treasure Hunt, I’m gonna get the world\nrecord in the Snow Slope Run! Ehehehe...
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Oh, my dear Grusha... ▶
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Grusha used to be a pro snowboarder, you know.\nI came here to meet him, but now I’m lost!
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Grushaaa! Where are yooouuu?
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I suppose if I head toward the mountain peak, I’ll\neventually spot the Glaseado Gym, where my\r\ndear Grusha awaits me...
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I sense a strong aura... ▶

TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If you made it all the way out here, you’ve gotta\nbe strong for sure.
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Woo-hoo! ▶
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I was born up north, so I get excited when I\ncome to cold places like this.
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You left me out in the cold!
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It’s amazing what a difference it makes when you\nprotect your head and ears against the cold!
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	A little more\nrespect, please? ▶
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hey, you! You’re not treatin’ the mountain with\nthe respect it deserves!
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Just a little bit is all I’m askin’...
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You can never be overprepared for a hike! Bring\nall the items you can carry—and then some!
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Oh! It’s someone\nfrom school... ▶
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	It’s kind of embarrassing bumping into your\nschoolmates outside of school, huh?
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I lost... Now I’m even more embarrassed.
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I hate running into people I know when I’m out\nand about. It’s weird, I know.
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Thick Fat is\nwhere it’s at! ▶
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My protective layer of fat keeps me nice and\ntoasty even out in the cold!
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Being nice and toasty didn’t help me win...
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Pokémon with the Thick Fat Ability receive less\ndamage from Fire- and Ice-type moves!
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	This is the perfect\nplace to train! ▶
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I come to harsh environments like this to train my\nbody and soul. That’s just my style!
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My Pokémon and I were too busy hunkering\ndown against the cold.
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The body temperatures of most Dragon types\nvary greatly with their environment.\c\nThat’s why they don’t handle ice and snow all\nthat well.
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_ARTIST_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	What is art? ▶
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_ARTIST_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	What is art? I...I don’t even know anymore.
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_ARTIST_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That last move of yours was pure art!

TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Careful there,\nyoung one. ▶
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You ought to be careful. There’s no shortage of\nstrong Trainers in these parts.
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I suppose none of the other Trainers were as\nstrong as you.
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	A weak Trainer could never make it up here.\nI apologize for judging you prematurely.
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_ARTIST_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I’ll use the snow! ▶
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_ARTIST_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m going to use snow to make art! That’s why I\ncame up here!
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_ARTIST_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh nooo! I just realized something!
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_ARTIST_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Any art that I make out of snow is going to melt\nas soon as I take it with me off this mountain!\r\nArgh! Back to square one.
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Time to whip out\nmy camera app! ▶
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ll take an awesome video of this battle with my\ncamera app! It’s gonna blow up everyone’s feeds!

TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Being strong and free is tough...
TRID_AREA17_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Mountains are dangerous, huh? Maybe I’ll head\nto the forests instead!

TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Aha! My hypothesis was correct! People in this\nregion talk to each other to start battles!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I guess it’s Paldean culture to approach other\nTrainers and talk to them to engage in battles.
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Did you know that there are regions where\nyou have to battle if you make eye contact?

TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_TAXIDRIVER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Are you a Pokémon Trainer? Flying Taxi fees are\nwaived for Trainers.
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_TAXIDRIVER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re most definitely a Trainer, all right!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_TAXIDRIVER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The Pokémon League pays the Flying Taxi fares\nfor all Trainers, so take all the rides you like.

TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re even wilder than the rolling boulders!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I wonder if I could get up to the peak riding on a\nPokémon if I just avoided the boulders?

TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_3_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Getting to interact with the locals wherever you\ngo is one of the best parts of traveling.
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_3_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	W-wow! You’re quite the character!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_3_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Kids from Paldea are pretty strong, huh?! I hope\nI brought enough Potions...
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_4_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Guess what’s in\nmy backpack? ▶
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_4_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Inside my backpack, I have...Pokémon!

TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_KARATE_4_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Black Belts just HAVE to choose Fighting-type\nPokémon!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_KARATE_4_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Now that was a tough fight!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_KARATE_4_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	We Black Belts love our Fighting-type Pokémon,\nyou know!\c\nSo don’t come at us with Psychic- or Flying-types\nor anything like that!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_F_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	It was carryin’ a coin! ▶
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_F_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m tryin’a find a widdle Pokémon carryin’ a coin!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_F_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m tryin’ so hard! But I can’t find it! I just stare\ninto the tall grass...
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_F_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	That widdle coin Pokémon runs away fast! You\ncan’t catch it, but it drops a coin if you find it!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	That barricade... ▶
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	That barricade over there is part of a Team Star\nbase. Team Star is trouble, so battle me instead!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I guess I couldn’t trick you even with such a slick\nbattle invitation...
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The boss of Team Star’s Dark crew has a real\nmean look in his eyes.

TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I want a lovely prize! Let’s battle!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Awww. This doesn’t add to my win count!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	One of the League staffers at the Pokémon\nCenter told me we could get lovely prizes if we\r\nwin battles against a lot of other Trainers.
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_DELIVERER_3_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I’m just no good... ▶
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_DELIVERER_3_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Ahhh! I’m just no good! No good at all!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_DELIVERER_3_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	See? I told you!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_DELIVERER_3_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m no good as a courier. I always skip out on\nwork to battle. That’s bad, isn’t it?
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Brand-spankin’ new! ▶
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m a brand-spankin’ new Dragon Tamer! I’ll rawr\nat ya with my dragon power!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Aren’t Dragon-types supposed to be strong?!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I guess it’s ME that’s weak, not my Pokémon! I’ll\nwork hard to get stronger!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	TMs! Wooo! ▶
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve taught my Pokémon all sorts of strong moves\nusing TMs, you know!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I need to make even stronger TMs!
TRID_AREA09_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	TMs are great because you can teach Pokémon\nmoves they couldn’t learn otherwise.
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Casseroya! Casseroya! ▶
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hey! What does Casseroya mean? That’s all I can\nthink about recently!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wait! I know! Maybe it’s a royal casserole?!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	By the way, Casseroya Lake is to the north—but\nyou won’t get very far if you can’t swim!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_CHEF_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	To the west... ▶
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_CHEF_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	There’s a town to the west! But there’s an\nopponent right in front of you!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_CHEF_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re strong regardless of what direction you’re\nheaded, huh?!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_CHEF_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The market town of Porto Marinada lies to the\nwest! By the way, west is the direction marked in\r\nyellow on the map app.
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	So strong! So rare! ▶
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You want to see my strong and rare Pokémon,\ndon’t you? DON’T YOU?
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	So strong! So wonderful!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I hear there are Pokémon out there with different\ncoloration than other members of their species.\r\nI sure would like to see one of those someday!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Natuuure! ▶
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Let’s have a battle out here surrounded by all this\nsoothing nature!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Well, that wasn’t very soothing...
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m gonna have a picnic at all the spots in Paldea\nwith good views.
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Can you help me? ▶
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	If I win, can you help me by making my deliveries\nin my stead?
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I knew that wouldn’t work!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I guess this loss was the motivation I needed!\nTime to get back to work!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I want... ▶
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I want power!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your power! It’s overwhelming!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	How did you get so powerful?
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Heeelp! ▶
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Heeelp! My hand throws Poké Balls all on its own!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Guess I picked the wrong opponent. Hmph!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_INFANT_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I gotta get ready for the next person, so you go\naway, OK? Go!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Top spot! ▶
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Mountains are a top spot in my book...because\nthey’re so high up! Get it?
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I lost! I did, did I?
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Phrases like “top spot” are called palindromes!\nThey read the same forwards and backwards!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I prefer the indoors! ▶
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I prefer the indoors, but I came here to see this\namazing sight.
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What an amazing sight!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	This place is called Colonnade Hollow. It’s one of\nthe Ten Sights of Paldea.\c\nI’m going to research how the area came to be\nshaped this way!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Hey! Do you know... ▶
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hey! Do you know... Do you know how strong\nI am?!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I was just a big fish in a small pond...but you\nshowed me what the ocean is like!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	There are people more talented than me all over\nthis great big world of ours, huh?
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_WAITER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	The ocean is so vast... ▶
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_WAITER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Let’s have a battle here with a refreshing\nocean view!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_WAITER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What? This isn’t the ocean? It’s a lake?!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_WAITER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	My map app says this body of water is a lake...\nAren’t lakes basically just tiny oceans?
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	She’s so popular! ▶
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Have you heard of the superpopular streamer\nnamed Iono?
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Ah! I was going to buy merch with that money!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Iono’s a streamer and a Gym Leader, too! She’s\nalso super cute! You should watch her stuff.
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_WAITRESS_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Welcome! ▶
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_WAITRESS_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Welcome to the outdoor café! Our special today\nis the taste of defeat—coming right up!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_WAITRESS_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Ah... so THIS is what defeat tastes like!
TRID_AREA11_TRAINER_WAITRESS_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Defeat doesn’t taste so bad once you get used\nto it. An acquired taste, I suppose?
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	My Pokémon\nis the cutest! ▶
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My Pokémon is obviously the cutest, but my\nfriends just don’t get it!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I don’t mind losing, as long as I got to convey to\nyou how cute Dedenne is!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Some people don’t like Dedenne because it\nsteals electricity. But honestly, being a li’l thief\r\njust makes it even cuter...
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	You been to Medali? ▶
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Medali’s famous Treasure Eatery gets a one-star\nreview from me!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your battle skill is five stars!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I heard you can change your Pokémon’s Tera\nType at the Treasure Eatery, but that stubborn\r\nchef wouldn’t even give me the time of day!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Behold my illusions! ▶
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I will show you the illusion of the century!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You saw right through my illusions!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Zorua’s always disguised as some other Pokémon.\nIt’s really hard to find!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Where’s the\nbattle court...? ▶
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I need to make a delivery to Medali’s\nbattle court!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I can’t find my destination OR my way to victory...
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Medali has a Gym, but I don’t see a battle\ncourt anywhere!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Work, work, work... ▶
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Right! I’ve made up my mind!\nI’ll go to work if I win this battle!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Woooooo! I lost, so I guess I’m taking today off!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Just to be clear, I didn’t lose just so I could take\nthe day off, OK? I would never do that.
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	When two\nTrainers meet... ▶
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	A battle is unavoidable when two Trainers meet!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Where there’s a victor, there’s also a loser.
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Battling you reminded me of how I used to be—\npicking fights with everyone I came across.
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	The ice cream vendor... ▶
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	The ice cream vendor at Medali was selling\nsomething mighty strange.
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That wasn’t very sweet of you!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I didn’t know modern ice cream vendors had such\nsalty-sweet ice cream!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_WAITRESS_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Hee hee hee! ▶
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_WAITRESS_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hee hee hee! I’m kinda the main attraction at\nmy café!

TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Wanna know the cutest Pokémon of them all?\n’Cause I’m gonna tell you!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Allow me to illustrate for you the many qualities\nthat make Pawmo such a cute— Wait, I lost?
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	OK, so, what makes Pawmo so cute is how it\nhustles its little heart to keep up when you’ve got\r\nit walking around with you—and ohmygosh,\r\nI even heard that if you walk with it enough,\r\nit might even evolve, and I just absolutely\r\nCANNOT EVEN with how cute it is! Hee hee!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_CLEANING_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Could you be...? ▶
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_CLEANING_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Could you be...what I’m here to clean up?
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_CLEANING_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You wiped the floor with me...
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_CLEANING_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	My mistake—I took you for someone else.\nNow go away and don’t talk to me.
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	If I had to pick... ▶
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	If I had to pick between the hike up a mountain\nand the hike down...the hike down’s more fun!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I took a steep fall!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	When two people on a mountain trail pass each\nother, the one going up has the right of way!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	We’ve got to\nsynergize! ▶
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We’ve got to synergize across all metrics! Let’s\npivot and take this offline.
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	We need to circle back on this...
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You really leveraged your core competencies.\nI need to drill down on improving...

TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wow, you’re bold!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I guess you wouldn’t have come talk to me if you\nweren’t confident in your battle skills...
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_WAITER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I think my Pokémon\nis the cutest. ▶
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_WAITER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You seem to have a discerning eye. Have a look\nat the cutest Pokémon there is!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_WAITER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Ah, how utterly adorable Bergmite looks when\nit’s defeated...
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_WAITER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It’s plain as day that Bergmite’s the cutest of all,\nbut my friends just don’t see it.\c\nAnyway, you can find Bergmite on Glaseado\nMountain. You ought to catch one for yourself!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	It’s gotta be nearby... ▶
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	They say there’s a tunnel around here that leads\ninto the Great Crater of Paldea!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Looks like my search is getting cut short!
TRID_AREA12_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ve also heard there’s some research facility near\nthe entrance of the Great Crater of Paldea...\c\nThey say it’s fallen into disuse, but...ooh, I want\nto find it so bad! I just want to see what’s there!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I am a Dragon Tamer... ▶
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We Dragon Tamers are wielders of dragon\nPokémon!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	It seems you are even better at wielding your\npreferred Pokémon than I am.
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Dragons are a challenge to raise, but they have\nfew weaknesses. If you can raise them to be\r\nstrong enough, victory will be yours.
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I don’t wanna... ▶
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I don’t wanna do my job! No!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Waaaaaahhh! You meaniehead!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ve actually been having a really tough time at\nwork lately, but that sure helped!\c\nThere’s nothing like letting yourself act childish\nwhen you’re feeling overwhelmed!

TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Astounding! You have a Tera Orb, do you?
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	How dazzling!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Tera Orbs are quite precious, so only the best\nstudents and teachers are allowed to have them.
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Wahaha! ▶
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Wahaha! I’m out here enjoying my youth on my\nTreasure Hunt!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wahaha! Nothing will stop my enjoyment!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The only way to win in life is to enjoy it!\nIt’s a waste to think you should or shouldn’t\r\ndo something simply because of your age!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I want to be\nlike the wind... ▶
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I want to be like the wind and travel across the\nwhole wide world!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Why are the winds of fate always blowing\nagainst me?!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I saw this floaty Pokémon wafting along on the\nbreeze nearby!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_TAXIDRIVER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	“Beep-beep-beep” goes the\ncabbie, all through the sky ♪ ▶
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_TAXIDRIVER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Gah! Where’d you come from?! I was singing to\nmyself thinking there was no one around!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_TAXIDRIVER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I couldn’t even win, I was so embarrassed...
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_TAXIDRIVER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I was trying to think up a jingle to use on our\ncommercials for the Flying Taxi...\r\n“All through the sky...” ♪
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I just can’t decide! ▶
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I just can’t decide! What do you think?\c\nShould I go to Artazon to experience real art?\nOr Levincia for big-city thrills?
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I guess I should have been worrying more about\nwhich move to use in battle...
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Maybe I’ll go experience the art in Artazon...\nThere are a bunch of different art installations\r\non display all over the town.
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	It’s just no good... ▶
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	It’s just no good! I...I can’t control my power!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Phew! Thanks for helping me tamp down my\npower like that! It can be pretty overwhelming!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	My power is too great for my own good.\nSometimes it runs amok, and I just defeat every\r\nTrainer I meet. Glad that didn’t happen to you!
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	What should I throw...? ▶
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Pop quiz! What should I throw if I want to start\na battle?
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Well, that result sure threw me!
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It’s so nice how you can just throw a Poké Ball\ncontaining one of your Pokémon at a wild\r\nPokémon to dive right into a battle!
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I’ll stick with it! ▶
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ll show you! I’m tenacious, and I’ll stick it out\nno matter how hard the battle gets!
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Even though you’ve beat me, I still won’t give up!
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Attacking isn’t the only way to be strong! There\nare all kinds of moves that help you stick it out!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	My Pokémon! ▶
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My Pokémon! And your Pokémon! What’s so\ndifferent about them?!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	E-everything’s different!
TRID_AREA16_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Individual Pokémon have different individual\nstrengths, even if they’re the same species.
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_WORKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	All right! ▶
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_WORKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	All right! Just one bout! This’ll be a good\nwarm-up before I head to the work site!
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_WORKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That didn’t warm me up at all...
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_WORKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You’re real strong, kid! What do you do to\nwarm up?

TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_WAITRESS_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I-I was only kidding before! You didn’t really\nexpect me to pay you THAT much, did you?

TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m in a real downward spiral now!
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	So you can set your map so that north is always\nat the top, can you?\c\nAs you get up in years like me, figuring out these\nsmartphones can make you feel awful dumb!
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	You! ▶
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I saw you at the school, talking so familiarly with\nDirector Clavell!

TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_WAITER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	To be a waiter is to wait. I’ll wait for the perfect\nmoment to take care of you!
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_WAITER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	N-now wait just a moment!
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_WAITER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	My battle strategy hinges on sometimes waiting\nfor my opponent to land a blow before I do.\r\nBut sometimes I lose if I wait too long...

TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Sunflora flood the floral fiefdom in formation!\nSunflora flood the floral fiefdom in formation!\r\nI made up my own tongue twister!
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Sunflora flood the flooof—\nDah! No! I messed up!
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Sunflora flood the floral fiefdom in formation! I\nmade my tongue twister ’cause I love Sunflora.\c\nThe Gym Test in Artazon was right up my alley!
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_WORKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	My reason for living! ▶
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_WORKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My work is my reason for living! It’s something\nthat’s worth doing, and it gives me purpose!
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_WORKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Well, since I lost, I guess I’ll be getting back to\nwork now!
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_WORKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If you do what you love for work, then at least\nyou know you’ll enjoy that part of your life!\c\nIt won’t be all fun and games, but it’s still better\nthan a kick in the teeth!

TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Did you know Team Star’s Fire crew has a base\nnear here?

TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Are you the client? Did you manage to bring the,\nah, sample that I contacted you about?
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I-I’m pretty sure you aren’t my client! Please!\nDon’t make me battle any more!
TRID_AREA15_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Sh-shove off, won’t you! Before anyone sees!\nI’m supposed to meet someone here who said\r\nthey’d show me some super cute Pokémon!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	That was one\ntasty-looking Pokémon. ▶
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I don’t know how to describe it, but it’s...like...\nman, that Pokémon I saw! It looked delicious!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I don’t know how to put this, but...like...thanks\nfor the battle!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	So this really tasty-looking Pokémon, right? It was\njust going along, then this other huge Pokémon\r\nwent and, like, gulped it right down!\c\nI guess that’s what happens when you look so\ndarn tasty. You get eaten, that’s what.
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I’ve heard the rumors... ▶
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve heard the rumors of a Pokémon in these\nlands—one known as the False Dragon Titan!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	But what is this False Dragon?! What is real?!\nWhat is false?!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Could it be that the False Dragon Titan isn’t a\nreal dragon at all? But...but...\c\nWhat’s even the point if it’s not a real dragon?
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Take a picture for\nme, would you? ▶
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m about to beat you. It’d be great if you could\ntake a commemorative photo for me when I do!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I don’t need a photo to commemorate losing!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Um, sorry if I was a bit over the top just then...\c\nAll this wide-open space really gives the ol’\nemotions room to run wild!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Hoooh! Haaah! ▶
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hoooh! Haaah!\nHoooh! Haaah!\r\nYes, the air out here truly is fine! Breathe deep!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Why, I detect a hint of a salt on the breeze!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The air out here is the best of any I’ve had. I’d\nhappily live on it all my remaining days!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Oooh! Ow-ow-ow! ▶
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I spent too long crouched down sneaking through\nthe tall grass—now my back is killing me!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I wonder if I could’ve won if my back wasn’t\nacting up like this...
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You can get close to wild Pokémon without them\nnoticing you if you crouch down nice and low.\r\nBut your back might regret it...
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_TAXIDRIVER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Wow, all the\nway out here? ▶
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_TAXIDRIVER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You’ve sure put in some effort, coming all the\nway out here on your own little legs.
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_TAXIDRIVER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Those little legs hold up some real great skills!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_TAXIDRIVER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	There aren’t any towns or Pokémon Centers or\nanything around these parts.\c\nIf you get tired, don’t try to tough it out! Give a\nFlying Taxi a call!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	What if I put\nthe camera here? ▶
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m actually a singer, see. I came out here to\nscout a location for my next music video.
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I got beat by some...some NOBODY?!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	That’s it! We’re definitely not filming here!\c\nI can’t even stand here without remembering that\nI lost a battle to someone like you!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	The greatest view of all... ▶
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m traveling the expanse of Paldea in search of\nthe greatest view of all.
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I wonder how the world looks in your eyes?
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I thought I might have finally found the greatest\nview of all here, but it seems I was wrong...\r\nI think there are still greater sights to aspire to!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_CHEF_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Mushroom! Mushroom! ▶
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_CHEF_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Mushroom! Mushroom? MushROOOOOOM!
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_CHEF_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh! My word! Please forgive me! I was quite\ncaught up in my own world there for a moment...
TRID_AREA18_TRAINER_CHEF_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I was playing with the adorable little mushroom\nPokémon and lost all track of where I was!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	*pant pant* ▶
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I was...climbing this rock face...so I’m...outta\nbreath...but my team’s...fine!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Phew... Hah!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If only I could...ride a Pokémon and let it do the\nclimbing...
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	If I could only\ncross the sea... ▶
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Lend me a Pokémon that can take me across\nthe sea!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Looks like I’m sunk!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If only there was some Pokémon I could ride over\nthe sea, I could be sitting and sipping something\r\non a sandy beach right now!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Been out east? ▶
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	One of Team Star’s bases is off to the east of\nhere. So scary!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I guess if I was as strong as you, I wouldn’t need\nto be scared, even of Team Star!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_SCH_BOY_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Team Star’s Fighting crew has a base off to the\neast of here, and their boss is super scary...\r\nTh-that grim look she’s always got—brrr!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Quite the traveler,\naren’t you? ▶
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You’ve come a good long way since setting out\nfrom the academy, haven’t you?
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Yes, I could feel precisely how much experience\nyou’ve gained on your travels.
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You and I have both walked the same distance,\nand yet I still lost to you.\c\nI suppose that the paths you’ve chosen must have\nbeen richer in what they offered.
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	This...is...ridiculous! ▶
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	So ridiculous! I was doing the Snow Slope Run on\nGlaseado Mountain and ended up...here!\r\nWhere the heck is “here” anyway?!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Whoa! Your Pokémon are ridiculously strong!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_SCH_GIRL_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I wasn’t actually planning to come here, but this\nended up pretty fun, too! Huh!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Yes! At last! ▶
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hey! Hey, you there! You’re mine! Once I defeat\nyou, you’ll be another “feather in my cap”!\r\nBut what does that even mean?!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Looks like we may never know!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Sure, if you just looked up the phrase, you could\nfind out in a sec what it means...but it’s fun\r\nmaking people stop and wonder!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Sandwiches... Yes... ▶
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Apparently this one earl thought up sandwiches\nbecause he wanted to be able to eat while\r\nkeeping a hand free to play games!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I guess Pokémon battling isn’t really a game...\nSeems I can’t pull it off one-handed!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I love learning the history of things. I always ace\nall my history tests, too.
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I am the\ndragon’s wings! ▶
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I am the eldest of three sisters, the one who’s\nclaimed the dragon’s wings! I’ll blast you away!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	It seems I failed to take flight...
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Dragons may be slow to grow, but if you put the\ntime into raising one, they’re fearsomely strong!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I am the\ndragon’s breath! ▶
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I am the second of three sisters, the one who’s\nclaimed the dragon’s breath! I’ll blow you away!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You left me no time to catch my breath...
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Dragons are weak to Ice-type moves, and they\nhave a hard time taking on cute little fairies, too.
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I am the\ndragon’s tail! ▶
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I am the youngest of three sisters, the one who’s\nclaimed the dragon’s tail! And I’ll send you flying!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I might have to turn tail and run!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_2_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It was my big sister who thought up this whole\nthing about us being different parts of a dragon...\r\nHonestly, I find it all a bit embarrassing.
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_OL_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	So free! ▶
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_OL_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m no longer bound by the office! The whole\nwide world is my office now!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_OL_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I think it’s time I clock out for the day!
TRID_AREA21_TRAINER_OL_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Hmmm. If the whole world is my office...does that\nmean I never actually leave work?
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_CHEF_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Bamboo shoots pop-\npop-popping up! ▶
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_CHEF_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I came out hunting for bamboo shoots, but I\nguess I could forage for battles while I’m at it!
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_CHEF_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Shoot, I was so busy thinking about bamboo\nthat I didn’t focus on the battle...
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_CHEF_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Big Bamboo Shoots are quite valuable, so you\ncan sell them at shops for a tidy profit!
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Unbelievable! ▶
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Gosh, I feel like a buffoon! I thought the thing\nI saw was just a mushroom, but it was ALIVE!
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I guess there really are fungus among us!
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_SCH_CHILD_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The Mushroom Pokémon Foongus is poisonous\ntoo, so be careful around it!
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_ARTIST_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	These falls... ▶
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_ARTIST_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	These falls are said to be quite famous. I’ll help\ncommemorate your visit with a fine battle!
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_ARTIST_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I got so worked up the sweat was pouring down\nmy back like a cascade!
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_ARTIST_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	They’re called the Fury Falls...but I wonder what’s\ngot them so angry?
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Pro...wrestling? ▶
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You young’uns call that flashy sport pro wrestling,\nright? Is it popular among your set these days?
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	It seems you are a pro at Pokémon battles.
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_SCH_SENIOR_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I saw a student up ahead who was all done up in\nthe most outrageous pro wrestling outfit.\c\nIt was absolutely splendid! I wonder if she would\nlet me join her in her shenanigans?
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Hyah! Rah! ▶
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I got my black belt through an online course!
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wait, this stuff is way harder in real life?!
TRID_AREA22_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Nowadays you can do everything online! It’s a\nnew age of remote learning!

TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	A backpacker’s\nonly weakness! ▶
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	A backpacker’s only weakness is Steel-type\nmoves!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Darn, you saw through my lie?
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	My real weakness is Reality-type moves! I just\nwant to get away from reality! Ahaha...hah...
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	The academy\nhas a secret! ▶
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	If you can defeat me, I’ll tell you the academy’s\nbig secret!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I lost? Then I guess I’ve got no choice but to spill\nthe beans...
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The academy had some kind of big brouhaha\nback when I first enrolled.\c\nAll the teachers at the time quit. The teachers\nwe’ve got now were all hired after that.
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I’m sick of it! ▶
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m just so sick of research! Help distract me so\nI can forget about my work for a while!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What is your training method? And what do you\nfeed your team? Are their moves from TMs?
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Even when I want to stop questioning everything,\nI can’t! I guess this is why I’m a scientist.
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I am strong. ▶
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I am strong. And so I battle.
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You...are strong!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_DRAGONTAMER_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I am strong. You are stronger. That is all there is\nto it, really.
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_DELIVERER_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Delivery! ▶

TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re not lost at all, are you?! Don’t tell me...\nYou actually WANTED to come out here?!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I was trying to catch a Pokémon, followed it all\nthe way out here...and ended up getting lost!\r\nI think I’ll call a Flying Taxi!

TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, are you just here for a hike? Not to camp?
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_MOUNTAIN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Food always tastes better up in the mountains,\ndoesn’t it? I guess exhaustion is the best spice!

TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Such a shame... ▶
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	It was such a shame, what happened to Grusha.\nThat accident ruined his snowboarding career!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Ah, sorry for going on about old news! I suppose\nthat all must have been before your time.
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_SCH_MIDDLE_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Grusha was once the second best snowboarder\nin all the world...\c\nBut he was injured in an accident—badly enough\nthat he was forced to retire from the sport.
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I understand! ▶
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I understand! Here! In this freezing land!\nI’ve finally come to understand a great truth!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Yes, you’ve made me understand it all too well!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_KARATE_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I understand now that training in freezing places\nisn’t efficient! You don’t get strong—just sick!\r\nAh-ah-ah-CHOOO!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	That uniform... ▶
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	That uniform looks really good on you! Do you\nthink it would look good on me too?
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I-is that a no?!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_BACKPACKER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Seeing you out having adventures in your uniform\nreminded me of my own school days, that’s all...
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I need more data! ▶
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve decided my research subject for the day!\nAllow me to collect some data from YOU!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Why can’t I seem to capture your data?!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_RESEARCHER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I couldn’t collect any data at all! Is something\nwrong with my equipment?!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_DELIVERER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Ow! Ow! Ow! ▶
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_DELIVERER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I twisted my ankle climbing over some rocks.\nMaybe a battle will distract me from the pain!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_DELIVERER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I forgot about my ankle, but now my pride hurts!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_DELIVERER_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Isn’t it handy how Pokémon can go and heal\nthemselves of minor injuries or status conditions\r\nif they’re holding a Berry?

TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_KARATE_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve got three Gym Badges, but I failed the\ninterview at the Pokémon League!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_KARATE_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I got three Gym Badges and still got beat by\nsome little kid?!
TRID_AREA19_TRAINER_KARATE_1_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I guess the Pokémon League won’t give you a\nserious interview unless you have eight badges...?

TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_ARTIST_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Such beauty... ▶
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_ARTIST_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Such beauty, only to be marred by ugly piles of\njunk! I can’t stand it!
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_ARTIST_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Sorry, sorry! Guess I shouldn’t have taken out my\nfrustration on you!
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_ARTIST_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Is that one of those Team Star bases? I guess\nthey must have put a lot of effort into building it.
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Team Star! ▶
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I came here to join Team Star!
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	If I can’t even defeat a regular old student, will\nI even make the cut for Team Star...?
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I don’t yet have the strength for Team Star! Guess\nI’ll have to train up and try again... Whoof...
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	The power of music! ▶
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	The power of music can bring joy to the world!
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Bow to the power of musiiiiiic!
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_MUSICIAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Maybe I should worry less about the power of\nmy music and more about the power of my team.
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_OL_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I need a new job... ▶
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_OL_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Maybe working at the Pokémon Center near here\nwould be more fun than my current job...
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_OL_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Gaaah! I’ve got to go heal my Pokémon!
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_OL_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Kids like you must keep the workers at the\nPokémon Center busy all the time!
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	(This is so boring...) ▶
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My boyfriend and I came here for a picnic, but I\nguess I’ve got some free time to battle you!
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oooh, how exciting!
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_F_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Honestly, who goes on a picnic for a date?\nAren’t picnics for kids?
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	(I hope this\ngoes well...) ▶
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I came here for a picnic with my girlfriend! I’m so\nnervous! Help me calm my nerves!
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	No, I’m still so nervous! This was such a big step!\nIs a picnic too much, too fast?
TRID_AREA20_TRAINER_SCH_YOUNG_M_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I can’t wait to hang out with my girlfriend, just\nmaking sandwiches and relaxing together!
TRID_AREA24_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Isn’t that the\nschool where— ▶
TRID_AREA24_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Is there a woman named Miriam working at your\nschool? She and I once worked together.
TRID_AREA24_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	It seems you’re getting a good education!
TRID_AREA24_TRAINER_MODEL_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Miriam and I used to work together at a\nPokémon Center once upon a time.\c\nOf course, we’ve each gone down our own paths,\nbut I’m glad to hear she’s still doing her best.
TRID_AREA25_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	Sea Pokémon! ▶
TRID_AREA25_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I swam out here to catch Pokémon from the sea!
TRID_AREA25_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh no, swimming cramp!
TRID_AREA25_TRAINER_MANIA_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’d swim to the very end of the seas if it meant\nfinding rare Pokémon!
TRID_AREA26_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_POPUP	I can’t find it... ▶
TRID_AREA26_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve looked everywhere, but I just can’t find it!\c\nI can’t find my potential anywhere!
TRID_AREA26_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Seems my potential doesn’t lie in battle, either...
TRID_AREA26_TRAINER_BUSINESSMAN_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Children are just bursting with potential...\nMeanwhile, I feel like my bubble’s burst.
