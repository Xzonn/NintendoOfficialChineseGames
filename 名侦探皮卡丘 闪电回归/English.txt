A0_1023_PIKACHU_100_1000	You know how important that hat is to me—and\nCorviknight just flew off with it!
A0_1023_PIKACHU_100_2000	What a mess... Let’s go get it back!
A0_1023_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hm? What’s that?
A0_1023_PIKACHU_100_4000	Hey, Tim! Over here!
A0_1030_PIKACHU_100_1000	Over here, Tim!
A0_1047_TIM_100_1000	We should return this notebook to Mayor Myers.
A0_1047_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. But first we’ve gotta deal with Corviknight!
A0_1047_TIM_100_2000	Right. Let’s go, Pikachu!
A0_1055_NONAMEBUTLER_100_1000	Hrm... Now what do we do...
A0_1055_TIM_100_1000	That’s—!
A0_1055_PIKACHU_100_1000	Uh-oh! This doesn’t look good!
A0_1070_TIM_100_1000	Is that Pidove unconscious?!
A0_1070_NONAMEBUTLER_100_1000	Don’t touch it. Moving this Pokémon could injure it.
A0_1070_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, you! Big guy! What happened to Pidove?
A0_1070_NONAMEBUTLER_100_2000	Well, I’m at a loss. Nothing we’ve tried so far\nis working...
A0_1070_PIKACHU_100_2000	Heeey! Can you even hear me?
A0_1070_NONAMEBUTLER_100_3000	You! Cut your Pikachu’s “pika pika” chatter and\nevacuate the area!
A0_1125_NONAMEBUTLER_100_1000	I need to track down Corviknight and get this area\nevacuated, but I can’t just leave this Pidove here...
A0_1125_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey! What happened?
A0_1130_TIM_100_1000	Calm down, Pikachu.
A0_1130_TIM_100_2000	To everyone else, you’re just saying “pika pika.”
A0_1130_TIM_100_3000	I’m the only one who understands what you’re saying.
A0_1130_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, right... Sorry. Got a little worked up seeing Pidove\nin such bad shape.
A0_1130_PIKACHU_100_2000	OK, Tim. It’s on you to ask the big guy what\nwent down.
A0_1135_TIM_100_1000	Excuse me... What happened here?
A0_1135_NONAMEBUTLER_100_1000	Hm? Oh, you’re that young detective.
A0_1135_TIM_100_2000	Yes, I’m Tim Goodman. And this is my partner,\nPikachu.
A0_1135_BUTLER_100_2000	Will Butler, Pokémon Protection Bureau—and this\nAudino is with the police department’s rescue squad.
A0_1135_TABUNNE_100_1000	Audino...
A0_1135_BUTLER_100_3000	I’ll spare you the details. Right now, we need to help\nthis Pidove.
A0_1135_BUTLER_100_4000	All that wind Corviknight whipped up blew it around\nand knocked it out.
A0_1135_BUTLER_100_5000	Audino used a move to help Pidove recover, but it still\nhasn’t woken up.
A0_1135_TABUNNE_100_2000	Audino...
A0_1135_OHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	Chief! No civilian injuries to report at this time!
A0_1135_BUTLER_100_6000	Copy that. Great work!
A0_1135_BUTLER_100_7000	Now, I really should get back to leading the\nevacuation, but I can’t just leave Pidove here\nunconscious...
A0_1135_BUTLER_100_8000	You ought to clear out of here too, young detective.
A0_1135_TIM_100_3000	Mr. Butler!
A0_1135_TIM_100_4000	Let us help you take care of Pidove.
A0_1135_TIM_100_5000	We’ll find a way to wake it up!
A0_1135_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah! Let a couple of great detectives handle this!
A0_1135_BUTLER_100_9000	You?
A0_1135_BUTLER_100_10000	Hmm... This is an emergency situation—one that\nrequires my full attention. Maybe I should let you\nhelp...
A0_1135_BUTLER_100_11000	All right. I’ll leave waking up this Pidove to you.
A0_1135_BUTLER_100_12000	I’m counting on you, young detective!
A0_1135_TIM_100_6000	Yes, sir!
A0_1135_TIM_100_7000	Let’s go, Pikachu!
A0_1135_PIKACHU_100_2000	OK!
A0_1135_MAMEPATO03_100_1000	Coooo...
A0_1135_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hm?
A0_1140_TIM_100_1000	Hey, why don’t we talk to those other Pidove?
A0_1140_PIKACHU_100_1000	Sure! Let’s give it a shot.
A0_1141_PIKACHU_100_1000	Where are you going, Tim? We gotta ask those\nPidove some questions.
A0_1142_PIKACHU_100_1000	Where are you going, Tim? We gotta ask those\nPidove some questions.

A0_1145_BUTLER_100_2000	I’m counting on you, young detective!
A0_1146_TABUNNE_100_1000	Audinooo...
A0_1146_PIKACHU_100_1000	Don’t worry. We’ve got this covered!
A0_1147_MAMEPATO02_100_1000	... ... ...
A0_1147_TIM_100_1000	Hang in there, Pidove!
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hold on a sec, Tim.
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_2000	Before we talk to these guys, there’s something I need\nto tell you.
A0_1148_TIM_100_1000	Yeah? What is it?
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_3000	Cases don’t just pop up when it’s convenient for us.
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_4000	I don’t gotta tell you that, right?
A0_1148_TIM_100_2000	Right.
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_5000	And it’s been a good long while since our last case...
A0_1148_TIM_100_3000	Well...that’s true...
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_6000	So let’s hit pause and jog our memories of how we go\nabout investigating a case.
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_7000	We’ll do this one by the book, all right?
A0_1148_TIM_100_4000	If you say so...
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_8000	Tim. This is our first investigation in a long time.
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_9000	Fortunately, Pidove’s injuries are already healed.
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_10000	All we gotta do is find a way to wake it up.
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_11000	Some might call it coincidence...but me?
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_12000	I call it an opportunity for a detective work tutorial.
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_13000	Perfect, right?
A0_1148_TIM_100_5000	I suppose...
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_14000	Let’s refresh our memory and make sure we conduct a\nfull investigation!
A0_1148_TIM_100_6000	OK. Got it!
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_15000	First, let’s quickly go over how we investigate.
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_16000	I talk to the Pokémon...
A0_1148_TIM_100_7000	...And I talk to the people!
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_17000	Together, the two of us will gather evidence and take\ntestimonies from people and Pokémon, and piece ’em\nall together to solve the case!
A0_1148_TIM_100_8000	Yep, that’s how we do it!
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_18000	Exactly!
A0_1148_TIM_100_9000	OK. This round of questioning is all yours, Pikachu.
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_19000	Sure thing! Here I go...
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_20000	Heeey! Pidove, can I talk to you?
A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_21000	I’m guessing you’re pals with that unconscious Pidove.\nMind if I ask you a couple questions?

A0_1148_PIKACHU_100_26000	Guess that’s all we’re gonna get... Maybe we should\nquestion some of the other Pidove around here.

A0_1240_PIKACHU_100_7000	Which means...Aromatisse might be able to help us\nwake up the unconscious Pidove!

A0_1574_BUTLER_400_1000	We were formed two years ago as a response to the\ninfamous R incident—the case you two solved.
A0_1574_BUTLER_400_2000	Back then, Pokémon-related disturbances were\nhappening all over the city.
A0_1574_BUTLER_400_3000	The human and Pokémon residents of Ryme City were\ndeeply affected by that.
A0_1574_PIKACHU_400_1000	... ... ...
A0_1574_BUTLER_400_4000	Mayor Myers was so shaken by what occurred,\nhe took it upon himself to create the PPB as a\ncountermeasure.
A0_1574_BUTLER_400_5000	He wanted to make sure crimes involving Pokémon—\nlike the R incident—would never happen again.
A0_1574_BUTLER_400_6000	That’s why this organization exists.
A0_1574_TIM_400_1000	Isn’t keeping the peace the police’s job, though?
A0_1574_BUTLER_400_7000	In the past few years, Ryme City has seen a\nconcerning rise in the number of reported incidents\nand accidents.
A0_1574_BUTLER_400_8000	The police are struggling to handle so many\nincidents—including those involving Pokémon.
A0_1574_BUTLER_400_9000	But now, the police can protect the human population\nof Ryme City, while the PPB protects the Pokémon.
A0_1574_BUTLER_400_10000	By dividing up the work, we can keep everyone safe.
A0_1574_TIM_400_2000	Ah, so that’s why the PPB was formed. Just what I’d\nexpect from Ryme City!
A0_1574_PIKACHU_400_2000	Howard really is looking out for us Pokémon, huh.
A0_1576_BUTLER_100_1000	By the way, young detective...
A0_1576_BUTLER_100_2000	I was watching your investigation earlier and couldn’t\nhelp but notice...
A0_1576_BUTLER_100_3000	Were you explaining things to Pikachu?
A0_1576_TIM_100_1000	Huh?
A0_1576_BUTLER_100_4000	I don’t think Pikachu understands what you’re telling\nhim, though.
A0_1576_BUTLER_100_5000	Unless the two of you can...
A0_1576_TIM_100_2000	Uh... I’m not actually talking to him. It’s more like...\ngetting advice? No, that’s not it, it’s—
A0_1576_BUTLER_100_6000	Oh, I get it!
A0_1576_BUTLER_100_7000	You talk to Pikachu to organize your thoughts!
A0_1576_BUTLER_100_8000	Interesting way to form your deductions, if you ask\nme! Bwahaha!
A0_1576_TIM_100_3000	Uh... Yeah! That’s it!
A0_1578_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well...we DO understand each other, actually...
A0_1578_TIM_100_1000	Phew... That was close. I thought he’d caught on to us!
A0_1578_PIKACHU_100_2000	Be careful. Usually, folks wouldn’t believe we can talk\nto one another...
A0_1580_OKPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	Whoa!
A0_1580_TIM_100_1000	Ah—!
A0_1584_TIM_100_1000	It’s Corviknight again!
A0_1584_PIKACHU_100_1000	Heeey! Gimme back my hat, would ya?!
A0_1586_TIM_100_1000	The chief went after Corviknight in his patrol car.
A0_1586_PIKACHU_100_1000	I bet Corviknight still has my hat!
A0_1586_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s follow it!
A0_1590_SECRETANASSY_100_1000	Eggzzz!
A0_1590_SECRETKAJICCHU01_100_1000	App!
A0_1590_TIM_100_1000	Those are Pokémon cries! Sounds like they’re coming\nfrom the direction Corviknight flew off in!
A0_1590_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s go check it out!
A0_1592_FREFUWAN_100_1000	Aroooma...
A0_1592_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s wondering why it even bothered helping us...
A0_1592_FREFUWAN_100_2000	Aromaaa!
A0_1592_PIKACHU_100_2000	’Cause now, instead of two Pidove following it\naround, there are five!
A0_1592_PIKACHU_100_3000	And it wants to know what we plan on doing\nabout that!
A0_1592_TIM_100_1000	S-sorry, Aromatisse.
A0_1592_PIKACHU_100_4000	Sorry. These Pidove don’t MEAN to be\nannoying you...
A0_1594_COIL_100_1000	Mag?
A0_1594_PIKACHU_100_1000	Why aren’t we running away? Well, I gotta get my hat\nback from Corviknight.
A0_1594_COIL_100_2000	Maaag.
A0_1594_PIKACHU_100_2000	Thanks for looking out for me. You stay safe too, OK?
A0_1596_NATIO_100_1000	Xatu...
A0_1596_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s telling us not to panic.
A0_1596_TIM_100_1000	Cool as a cucumber, even during a crisis.
A0_1600_TIM_100_1000	Whoa!
A0_1600_TIM_100_2000	Pikachu, look!
A0_1600_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, how do ya like these apples—they’re scattered\nall over the place! What a mess...
A0_1615_TIM_100_1000	Is this...a tree?
A0_1615_PIKACHU_100_1000	And it’s growing here?
A0_1615_TIM_100_2000	It’s kinda weird. Unless...
A0_1615_PIKACHU_100_2000	Unless what? No, no, this is definitely weird...
A0_1640_KAJICCHU02_100_1000	App!
A0_1640_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s dangerous here, Applin. You should find\nsomewhere that’s safe.
A0_1640_KAJICCHU02_100_2000	App!
A0_1640_TIM_100_1000	That’s odd. It doesn’t seem like it wants to leave.
A0_1640_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s talk to it.
A0_1640_PIKACHU_200_1000	Can I ask you some questions, Applin?
A0_1640_KAJICCHU02_200_1000	Aaapp!
A0_1640_SEL_0_1000	About you, Applin...
A0_1640_SEL_0_2000	What happened here?
A0_1640_PIKACHU_300_1000	I haven’t seen any Applin in this city before.\nWhere’d you come from?
A0_1640_KAJICCHU02_300_1000	App app.
A0_1640_PIKACHU_300_2000	Ohhh—you go to sleep in a wooden crate, and when\nyou wake up, you’re always someplace new?
A0_1640_TIM_300_1000	So the apple vendor travels to different locations, and\nthis Applin gets carried along.
A0_1640_PIKACHU_300_3000	The apple vendor probably doesn’t know about this\nApplin.
A0_1640_KAJICCHU02_300_2000	Appu.
A0_1640_PIKACHU_300_4000	Something suddenly shook it awake a moment ago.
A0_1640_TIM_300_2000	I’ll bet that was Corviknight—same goes for these\ncrates getting toppled over.
A0_1640_PIKACHU_300_5000	I don’t see the apple vendor... They must’ve\nevacuated the area.
A0_1640_KAJICCHU02_400_1000	App app.
A0_1640_PIKACHU_400_1000	So the wooden crate shook, you got thrown out...and\nthat’s when you realized your friends were missing?
A0_1640_TIM_400_1000	It got separated? Then let’s help find its friends!
A0_1640_PIKACHU_400_2000	Good thinking. How many friends were here\nwith you?
A0_1640_KAJICCHU02_400_2000	App!
A0_1640_PIKACHU_400_3000	Two? OK, got it.
A0_1650_PIKACHU_100_1000	From what Applin said, I think I get what’s going\non here.
A0_1650_PIKACHU_100_2000	But as much as I’d like to go get my hat back from\nCorviknight...
A0_1650_TIM_100_1000	We can’t just abandon a Pokémon in need of\nour help.
A0_1650_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yeah! What kinda great detectives would we be if we\ndidn’t lend a helping hand or two along the way?
A0_1650_TIM_100_2000	OK. Should we <color=#F39800FF>investigate </color>the fallen apples\nover there?
A0_1650_PIKACHU_100_4000	I’d be happy to, if there wasn’t a tree in the way.
A0_1650_PIKACHU_100_5000	Something about it seems odd to me... Maybe we\nshould investigate that first.
A0_1652_TIM_100_1000	OK, so we can’t investigate because this tree’s in the\nway. What should we do about it?
A0_1652_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well...we can’t just cut it down.
A0_1652_SECRETANASSY_100_1000	Egg!\nEggz!\nEggsss!
A0_1654_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wait, isn’t this an Alolan Exeggutor?
A0_1654_TIM_100_1000	I’d never seen one before, so I didn’t even realize\nthat! What’s it doing here in Ryme City?
A0_1654_PIKACHU_100_2000	Why don’t we ask and get some other questions in\nwhile we’re at it? We can’t investigate until it moves,\nanyway.
A0_1654_PIKACHU_100_3000	Heeey, Exeggutor! Over here! Look down, by\nyour feet!
A0_1654_ANASSY_100_1000	Egg!\nEggz!\nEggsss!
A0_1654_PIKACHU_100_4000	Whoa! Don’t all talk at once!
A0_1654_PIKACHU_100_5000	How ’bout this, Exeggutor—I’ll tell you which head\nshould answer! Sound good?
A0_1654_ANASSY_100_2000	Egg!\nEggz!\nEggsss!
A0_1654_PIKACHU_100_6000	Oops. Forgot to say which head.
A0_1654_ANASSY_200_1000	Egg!\nEggz!\nEggsss!
A0_1654_PIKACHU_200_1000	OK, listen up! The only head that should answer is the\none I specifically ask!
A0_1654_SEL_0_1000	About you, Exeggutor...
A0_1654_SEL_0_2000	What happened here?
A0_1654_PIKACHU_300_1000	Um... You, middlest head!
A0_1654_PIKACHU_300_2000	Why are you here?
A0_1654_ANASSY_300_1000	 \nEggz.
A0_1654_PIKACHU_300_3000	Guess it’s been traveling around with the apple\nvendor.
A0_1654_TIM_300_1000	That explains why it’s here in Ryme City.
A0_1654_PIKACHU_400_1000	You, right head! Tell me what happened here.
A0_1654_ANASSY_400_1000	 \n \nEggsss!
A0_1654_PIKACHU_400_2000	Corviknight came flying through, and when you tried\nto dodge it, you bumped into the fruit stand?
A0_1654_TIM_400_1000	I knew it.
A0_1654_PIKACHU_400_3000	By the way, have you seen a hat? Corviknight\ntook mine.
A0_1654_ANASSY_400_2000	 \n \nEggsss...
A0_1654_PIKACHU_400_4000	Guess it happened too suddenly for you to tell.\nOh well.
A0_1655_PIKACHU_100_1000	Uhhh, left head! We’ve got a favor to ask!
A0_1655_ANASSY_100_1000	Egg!
A0_1655_PIKACHU_100_2000	Sorry, but we wanna search through those apples\nscattered behind you.
A0_1655_PIKACHU_100_3000	Could you please scooch over a bit?
A0_1655_ANASSY_100_2000	Egg.
A0_1657_TIM_100_1000	Oh good, it moved for us.
A0_1657_PIKACHU_100_1000	Now we can investigate the scene.
A0_1660_TIM_100_1000	This is where all the apples got scattered around.
A0_1660_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let the investigating begin!
A0_1670_PIKACHU_100_1000	Remember what we’re looking for?
A0_1670_TIM_100_1000	The two missing Applin.
A0_1670_PIKACHU_100_2000	That’s right. There’s a lot of apples here, so try not to\noverlook ’em, OK?
A0_1680_PIKACHU_5000_1000	You sure you’ve checked everywhere?
A0_1685_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, this is a tasty apple! You want some too, Tim?
A0_1685_PIKACHU_100_2000	Don’t forget to pay for it!
A0_1690_TIM_100_1000	It’s an apple crate. No sign of Applin, though...
A0_1710_PIKACHU_100_1000	My hat!
A0_1710_TIM_100_1000	Corviknight dropped it!
A0_1710_PIKACHU_100_2000	Could’ve sworn it wasn’t here earlier. Anyway, I’m\njust glad to have it back.
A0_1715_PIKACHU_100_1000	There are apples everywhere.
A0_1715_TIM_100_1000	I don’t see any Applin.
A0_1715_PIKACHU_100_2000	At this point, these apples are only good for making\njuice or jam or something.
A0_1715_PIKACHU_100_3000	I’d still eat ’em, bruises and all.
A0_1725_TIM_100_1000	Look, an Applin! I found one!
A0_1725_KAJICCHU01_100_1000	App.
A0_1725_PIKACHU_100_1000	Have you been sitting still, pretending to be an apple\nthis whole time?
A0_1725_PIKACHU_100_2000	That must take a whole lotta patience...
A0_1725_KAJICCHU01_100_2000	App app.
A0_1725_PIKACHU_100_3000	Huh, patiently staying still is one of your talents?\nImpressive.
A0_1725_PIKACHU_100_4000	That Corviknight got you wrapped up in quite the\nmess though, didn’t it.
A0_1725_PIKACHU_100_5000	Your friend is waiting for you.
A0_1755_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, we searched pretty thoroughly...
A0_1755_PIKACHU_100_2000	I still don’t see my hat or the other Applin, though.
A0_1755_TIM_100_1000	Hmm... Where could it be?
A0_1758_PIKACHU_100_1000	Huh? Did you see something move behind that crate?
A0_1758_TIM_100_1000	What? No, I didn’t notice anything.
A0_1758_PIKACHU_100_2000	Try checking again. Maybe something’s changed.
A0_1823_TIM_100_1000	Pikachu! It’s an Applin!
A0_1823_PIKACHU_100_1000	Whoa!
A0_1823_TIM_100_2000	Are you OK?
A0_1823_PIKACHU_100_2000	Fine and dandy. Nice catch, by the way!
A0_1823_PIKACHU_100_3000	Are the Applin OK too?
A0_1823_TIM_100_3000	Yep, they all seem happy to be reunited.
A0_1823_PIKACHU_100_4000	Good. Glad they’re all right.
A0_1823_PIKACHU_100_5000	So one of ’em was wearing my hat, huh? Seeing it\nmove on its own really threw me for a loop!
A0_1823_TIM_100_4000	I’m sure Corviknight dropped the hat mid-flight and it\njust happened to fall on top of Applin.
A0_1823_PIKACHU_100_6000	Oh yeah! Hey Tim, where’s my hat?
A0_1823_TIM_100_5000	Don’t worry, I’ve got it.
A0_1823_PIKACHU_100_7000	At the end of the day, I’m just glad I didn’t lose\nmy hat!
A0_19001_TIM_100_1000	These are the medals we received.
A0_19001_PIKACHU_100_1000	They’re proof of all the good we’ve done with our\ngreat detective work. Let’s keep it up, Tim!
A0_19010_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, these are our old case notes.
A0_19010_TIM_100_1000	Yep, it’s all the stuff you told me to keep a record of.
A0_19010_PIKACHU_100_2000	Not bad, Tim! There’s a lot you can learn from past\ncases, y’know! Show me what you’ve got there.
A0_19010_PIKACHU_100_3000	Oho... The R case, eh? That takes me back.
A0_19010_PIKACHU_100_4000	It was the first case we partnered up on.
A0_19010_TIM_100_2000	Yeah. R was a chemical that made Pokémon\ngo berserk...
A0_19010_PIKACHU_100_5000	It was created from Mewtwo’s cells.
A0_19010_TIM_100_3000	When a Pokémon was given R, its eyes would glow\nred, and it would become enraged and violent.
A0_19010_TIM_100_4000	It was horrible.
A0_19010_TIM_100_5000	Even now, I still can’t believe they used innocent\nPokémon to cause all those incidents!
A0_19010_PIKACHU_100_6000	Same. That was one tough nut to crack, but we\nmanaged to catch the culprit in the end.
A0_19010_PIKACHU_100_7000	As for Mewtwo’s cells and the remaining vials of R...
A0_19010_PIKACHU_100_8000	we confiscated all that stuff when we brought the\nculprit to justice.
A0_19010_TIM_100_6000	Speaking of which...
A0_19010_TIM_100_7000	In our final confrontation with that guy, you managed\nto use one of your moves.
A0_19010_TIM_100_8000	You usually can’t use ANY of your moves. How were\nyou able to pull that off?
A0_19010_PIKACHU_100_9000	Beats me. I’m just as baffled as you are, kid.
A0_19010_PIKACHU_100_10000	After Harry went missing, I lost all my memories for\nsome reason.
A0_19010_PIKACHU_100_11000	That’s also when I realized I couldn’t use any moves.
A0_19010_TIM_100_9000	Maybe the pressure of that intense situation is how\nyou were able to use that move?
A0_19010_PIKACHU_100_12000	Could be. It’s a possibility, at least.
A0_19010_PIKACHU_100_13000	After I used that move, I just...blacked out.
A0_19010_TIM_100_10000	I was really worried about you.
A0_30010_POLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	Please be careful!
A0_30020_POLICEMAN03_100_1000	You should evacuate too, Detective.
A0_40040_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m a little curious about what that Pidove was\nsaying...
A0_40040_TIM_100_1000	Yeah. Its friend is unconscious, but all it wanted to\ntalk about was an aroma it likes.
A0_40040_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yep.
A0_40040_PIKACHU_100_3000	“Nice, strong aroma makes the sleepy times go\naway. ♪” That’s all I could get out of it.
A0_40040_TIM_100_2000	Aroma...sleepy times...go away...
A0_40040_TIM_100_3000	Wait. What if it was talking about USING some kind\nof scent...?
A0_40040_TIM_100_4000	And what if that scent could wake up its friend?
A0_40040_PIKACHU_100_4000	That’s it, Tim!
A0_40040_PIKACHU_100_5000	If we can find the strong aroma those Pidove were\nchirping about, maybe it’ll wake up their unconscious\nfriend!
A0_40040_TIM_100_5000	That’s what I’m thinking. It’s worth a shot, at least!
A0_40040_TIM_100_6000	But how are we going to find a scent like that?
A0_40040_PIKACHU_100_6000	There might be some Pokémon who haven’t\nevacuated yet. Maybe we can ask them.
A0_40050_PIKACHU_100_1000	Are you asking me what we should do next?
A0_40050_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A0_40050_SEL_0_2000	No
A0_40050_PIKACHU_300_1000	Pidove is unconscious.
A0_40050_PIKACHU_300_2000	So let’s find a way to wake it back up.
A0_40050_PIKACHU_300_3000	Talking to people and Pokémon is important, but you\noughta pay attention to other things around you too.
A0_40050_PIKACHU_400_1000	Oh. Well, it’s good that you’re thinking things through\nfor yourself.
A0_40060_PIKACHU_100_1000	Feeling stuck? Want me to give you some advice?
A0_40060_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A0_40060_SEL_0_2000	No
A0_40060_PIKACHU_300_1000	Aromatisse should be able to wake Pidove up.
A0_40060_PIKACHU_300_2000	Let’s talk to Aromatisse.
A0_40060_PIKACHU_400_1000	Oh. I guess that’s OK.
A0_40070_PIKACHU_100_1000	What’s wrong? Not sure what to do? Wanna ask me\nabout it?
A0_40070_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A0_40070_SEL_0_2000	No
A0_40070_PIKACHU_300_1000	We heard Pokémon cries coming from the direction\nCorviknight was flying toward.
A0_40070_PIKACHU_300_2000	Let’s go scope out the situation.
A0_40070_PIKACHU_400_1000	Oh. Well, it’s good that you’re thinking things through\nfor yourself.
A0_40080_PIKACHU_100_1000	Not quite sure what to do?
A0_40080_PIKACHU_100_2000	Should I tell you what I think?
A0_40080_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A0_40080_SEL_0_2000	No
A0_40080_PIKACHU_300_1000	Let’s question the people and Pokémon around here.
A0_40080_PIKACHU_300_2000	We might learn something that leads us to my hat.
A0_40080_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK, if you’re sure. Don’t hold back if you need\nanything.
A0_40085_PIKACHU_100_1000	Feeling stuck? Want me to give you some advice?
A0_40085_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A0_40085_SEL_0_2000	No
A0_40085_PIKACHU_300_1000	We wanna investigate where those apples are\nscattered, but that tree is in the way.
A0_40085_PIKACHU_300_2000	Why don’t we investigate the tree first?
A0_40085_PIKACHU_400_1000	Oh. I guess that’s OK.
A0_40090_PIKACHU_100_1000	Are you asking me what we should do next?
A0_40090_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A0_40090_SEL_0_2000	No
A0_40090_PIKACHU_300_1000	Let’s inspect the scattered apples. We gotta find\nApplin!
A0_40090_PIKACHU_400_1000	Oh. Well, it’s good that you’re thinking things through\nfor yourself.
A0_9020_TIM_100_1000	This is your first time in Ryme City, right, Sophia?
A0_9020_SOPHIA_100_1000	Uh-huh! It’s so busy—and fun. I’m glad I came!
A0_9020_SOPHIA_100_2000	That Corviknight surprised me, though.
A0_9020_TIM_100_2000	I’m glad you and Mom are OK.
A0_9030_IRENE_100_500	I’m glad you’re safe and doing well, Tim...but you\nhardly ever call!
A0_9030_IRENE_100_1000	I know no news is supposed to be good news, but you\ntake that a bit too far!
A0_9030_TIM_100_2000	S-sorry, Mom.
A0_9030_SEL_0_1000	About Ryme City...
A0_9030_SEL_0_2000	About meals...
A0_9030_IRENE_300_1000	I haven’t been to Ryme City in quite some time now.
A0_9030_IRENE_300_2000	Not since I last saw your father... Gosh, I guess it’s\nbeen about two years, then?
A0_9030_IRENE_400_1000	Tim, are you getting enough to eat?
A0_9030_TIM_400_1000	Yeah. Stopping by the Hi-Hat Café for breakfast is\npart of my daily routine.
A0_9030_IRENE_400_2000	The Hi-Hat Café?
A0_9030_TIM_400_2000	It’s Pikachu’s favorite spot.
A0_9030_TIM_400_3000	It’s so close now that we’ve moved, I’ve been going\nthere pretty much every morning.
A0_9030_IRENE_400_3000	Hmm... Maybe I should make some dinner for you\ntomorrow night, then. It’s been a while.
A0_9030_IRENE_400_4000	You miss my cooking, don’t you?
A0_9030_TIM_400_4000	Of course. Thanks, Mom. I’m looking forward to it.
A0_9040_SECRETEMILIA_100_1000	We interrupt your regularly scheduled programming to\nbring you this breaking news.
A0_9040_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh? What’s going on?
A0_Drama.asset
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_10	The name’s Pikachu.\nAnd I’m what you might call...
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_20	a great detective!
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_30_NOMESSAGE	(sipping sound)
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_40	With my bolts of brilliance,\nI’ve solved many mysteries.
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_50	My partner Harry and I ran into\nsome trouble on a case...
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_60	Harry suddenly disappeared,\nand I’d lost all my memories.
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_70	After that, I was wandering the city\nwhen I ran into Tim.
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_80	Somehow, he could understand\nwhat I was saying.
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_90	Our goals were one and the same:
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_100	Find Detective Harry—because my missing\npartner just so happened to be Tim’s dad.
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_110	While we were searching for Harry,
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_120	we uncovered a series of crimes involving R,\na chemical that drove Pokémon berserk.
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_130_NOMESSAGE	(sipping sound)
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_140	Tim and I managed to solve the case\nand save Ryme City. And yet...
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_150	Harry was still missing.
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_160	Even now...the two of us are still\nsearching for him.
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_100_170	Harry... Just where the heck did you go?
A0_Drama_HOWARD_300_10	And so, to promote an even stronger bond\nbetween the people and Pokémon of Ryme City,
A0_Drama_HOWARD_300_20	I hereby proclaim this day the start\nof Pokémon Friendship Week.
A0_Drama_HOWARD_300_30	To commemorate this event,
A0_Drama_HOWARD_300_40	we present this award to Tim Goodman\nand Pikachu, who saved—
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_300_10	Harry!
A0_Drama_HOWARD_300_50	“Pika”? Oh Pikachu, I’m sorry. \nI guess that’s a sign I better wrap this speech up!
A0_Drama_OAWOMAN02_300_10_NOMESSAGE	(crowd laughs)
A0_Drama_TIM_300_10	Wow... You couldn’t have picked\na worse time to doze off.
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_300_20	Sorry, sorry.
A0_Drama_HOWARD_300_60	Now then... Due to the R incident of two years ago,
A0_Drama_HOWARD_300_70	some of our citizens began to doubt Ryme City’s\nmotto, “Coexistence with Pokémon.”
A0_Drama_HOWARD_300_80	So, to those who were affected, I offer\nyou my deepest sympathies.
A0_Drama_OAWOMAN02_300_20	What’s that?!
A0_Drama_OAWOMAN02_300_25_NOMESSAGE	(worried murmuring)
A0_Drama_OCMAN01_300_10	A Corviknight?
A0_Drama_ARMORGA_300_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - angry)
A0_Drama_OHBUSINESSMAN01_300_10	Oh no! It’s coming this way!
A0_Drama_OKBUSINESSMAN01_300_10	Sir, follow me!
A0_Drama_HOWARD_300_90_NOMESSAGE	(small breath as he leaves)
A0_Drama_ARMORGA_300_15_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cries - angry)
A0_Drama_TIM_300_20	Everyone! Get inside right away!
A0_Drama_ARMORGA_300_20_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - angry)
A0_Drama_TIM_300_25_NOMESSAGE	(grunts)
A0_Drama_OAWOMAN02_300_30_NOMESSAGE	(distressed, panicked screaming)
A0_Drama_TIM_300_30_NOMESSAGE	Ergh!
A0_Drama_ARMORGA_300_25_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cries - intimidating, menacing)
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_300_30	What the heck is going on?!
A0_Drama_TIM_300_40	Could it be...R?
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_300_40	R? Don’t think so. Its behavior’s different.
A0_Drama_ARMORGA_300_30_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - angry, threatening)
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_300_50	It’s all right! Just calm down!
A0_Drama_ARMORGA_300_40_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cries - angry)
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_300_60	Gwah!
A0_Drama_ARMORGA_300_50_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)
A0_Drama_TIM_300_60	Huh? Pikachu...
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_300_70	Argh! Lousy Corviknight!
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_300_80	It just made off with my signature hat!
A0_Drama_TIM_300_70	My dad gave you that hat...
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_300_90	Yeah. We gotta get it back!
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_10	This was a real pain...
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_20	Huh?
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_30	Hey hey, get back here...
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_40	...The heck?
A0_Drama_TIM_400_10	Hey, quit playing around!
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_50	Hey, I’m not playing at all!\nMy hat keeps moving on its own!
A0_Drama_TIM_400_20	That’s ridiculous, Pikachu.
A0_Drama_TIM_400_30	Huh?
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_60	See? Told you so.
A0_Drama_ANASSY_400_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - friendly)
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_70	Guess I’ve gotta go get it...
A0_Drama_TIM_400_33	Guess so.
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_75	Well... Tim, lift me up.
A0_Drama_TIM_400_36	OK.
A0_Drama_TIM_400_40	You all right? Don’t hurt yourself.
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_80	Please, this’ll be nothing!
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_83	 
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_86	Whoa!
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_90	Wah-wah-wah-wah!
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_100	 
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_105	Whoops!
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_110	Aah-aah-aaahhh!!!
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_120	 
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_125	 
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_130	 
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_150	Finally gotcha back...
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_155	Huh?
A0_Drama_KAJICCHU_400_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - surprised)
A0_Drama_KAJICCHU_400_20_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - leaping)
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_160	Agh!
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_400_170	Aaahhh!!!
A0_Drama_HOWARD_200_20	Great work. Thank you.
A0_Drama_HOWARD_200_30	And you as well, Pikachu!
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_200_10	Yep!
A0_Drama_HOWARD_200_40	I can’t say it enough—Ryme City owes you\na debt of gratitude for your efforts.
A0_Drama_HOWARD_200_50	We strive for coexistence between\npeople and Pokémon in our fair city.
A0_Drama_HOWARD_200_60	And you two are the ideal detective duo!
A0_Drama_HOWARD_200_70	On behalf of the city, I’m pleased\nto present you with this medal.
A0_Drama_TIM_200_10	Thank you, Mayor Myers—I’m honored.
A0_Drama_HOWARD_200_80	Of course, you get one too, Pikachu.
A0_Drama_PIKACHU_200_20	Yeah! I’M the great detective!
A0_Drama_HOWARD_200_90	“Pika pika” to you too, little hero!\nBoth of you, keep up the great work.
A0_Drama_SOPHIA_200_10	Way to go, Tim!
A0_Drama_IRENE_200_10	Congratulations, hon!
A0_SRT.asset
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_500_10	Look—this must be the notebook\nthe mayor dropped...
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_500_20	There’s something inside.
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_500_30	A family photo?
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_500_40	This girl looks familiar... Oh! She’s\nthe one who didn’t look too happy\nduring the mayor’s speech.
A0_SRT_TIM_500_10	That’s my classmate, Rachel.
A0_SRT_TIM_500_20	She knows a lot about Pokémon.
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_500_50	Huh? Whoa, time out—you KNOW her?!\nWhy am I just now learning this?
A0_SRT_BUTLER_600_10_NOMESSAGE	Hmmm...
A0_SRT_TABUNNE_600_10_NOMESSAGE	Audi... (What should I do?)
A0_SRT_FREFUWAN_1200_10_NOMESSAGE	Ro-maaa! (Go gooo!)
A0_SRT_MAMEPATO02_1200_10_NOMESSAGE	Pi? (Huh?)
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_1200_2	All right!
A0_SRT_MAMEPATO03_1200_10_NOMESSAGE	Pipidooove pidooove! (Yaaay yaaay!)
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_1200_5_NOMESSAGE	Hahaha!
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_1200_10	Glad that worked.
A0_SRT_ARMORGA_1700_10_NOMESSAGE	(Pokémon cry)
A0_SRT_BUTLER_1700_10	It’s back again.
A0_SRT_ANASSY_1700_10_NOMESSAGE	(Pokémon cry)
A0_SRT_BUTLER_1700_20	Come on! Let’s chase it down.
A0_SRT_OHPOLICEWOMAN01_1700_10	Sir!
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_1400_10	Whoaaa! This tree’s an Exeggutor!
A0_SRT_ANASSY_1400_10_NOMESSAGE	(Heeey!)
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_1500_10	Yeesh, that was a hassle...
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_1500_20	Hup!
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_1500_30	Now that’s more like it.
A0_SRT_TIM_1500_10	Yeah, you look like yourself again.
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_1500_40	Thanks, Tim.
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_1500_50	Harry gave me this hat\nto commemorate our partnership.
A0_SRT_NOFACEANNOUNCE03_1500_10	The award ceremony will resume shortly.\nWe ask that all participants please return\nto the venue at this time.
A0_SRT_TIM_1500_20	Ah—! I guess we better hurry back!
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_1500_60	That darn Corviknight... I’ll let it off the\nhook just this once!
A0_SRT_IRENE_1800_10	Tim, I was so proud of you today!
A0_SRT_SOPHIA_1800_10	You’re amazing, Tim!
A0_SRT_TIM_1800_10	You think so?
A0_SRT_SOPHIA_1800_14	Everyone knows all about the amazing\nwork you two have done!
A0_SRT_SOPHIA_1800_18	There was the Eevee abduction case,\nthe fossil-stealing spree...
A0_SRT_IRENE_1800_16	And the Ryme Tower standoff case too!
A0_SRT_IRENE_1800_23	They even made a movie\nbased on the R case!
A0_SRT_SOPHIA_1800_22	Yeah, I thought that movie was pretty\ngood, but how come Mom and me\ndidn’t even show up in it?
A0_SRT_TIM_1800_25	I have no idea, but movies usually\ndo their own thing, don’t they?
A0_SRT_SOPHIA_1800_26	Yeah, I guess...
A0_SRT_SOPHIA_1800_30	Oh, by the way! I’ve been\nmeaning to ask you something...
A0_SRT_SOPHIA_1800_40	This is Dad’s Pikachu, right?
A0_SRT_TIM_1800_40	Yeah. He’s my partner\nat the moment, though.
A0_SRT_SOPHIA_1800_50	I see...
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_1800_10	Whoa, whoa. What’s with all the staring?
A0_SRT_IRENE_1800_30	He’s saved your dad\nfrom trouble many times.
A0_SRT_SOPHIA_1800_60	Wooow!
A0_SRT_TIM_1800_50	Oh, Pikachu! The news is about to start!
A0_SRT_TIM_1800_60	Maybe there’s an update on\nthat Corviknight.
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_1800_20	Yeah.
A0_SRT_SOPHIA_1800_70	... ... ...
A0_SRT_EMILIA_1900_10	According to amateur footage\nwe’ve received from a viewer,
A0_SRT_EMILIA_1900_20	Pokémon appear to have\ncaused an explosion.
A0_SRT_EMILIA_1900_30	This explosion occurred in the mountain\nrange northeast of Ryme City.
A0_SRT_EMILIA_1900_40	This may be related to the recent\nuptick in incidents involving Pokémon.
A0_SRT_EMILIA_1900_50	Ryme City Police and the newly\nestablished Pokémon Protection\nBureau are investigating.
A0_SRT_EMILIA_1900_60	Emilia Christie, signing off.
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_1900_10	Hey, Tim, did you catch that?
A0_SRT_TIM_1900_10	I hope that incident doesn’t have\nanything to do with Dad...
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_1900_20	Same here...
A0_SRT_TIM_1900_20	Mewtwo told me...two years ago.
A0_SRT_TIM_1900_30	Dad’s alive, and we’ll be able to find\nhim as long as we don’t give up.
A0_SRT_PIKACHU_1900_30	Yeah, Mewtwo is still our only\nconnection to finding Harry.
A0_SRT_IRENE_1900_10	Whispering to Pikachu, are you?
A0_SRT_IRENE_1900_20	You’re just like your father, talking\nto Pokémon like that.
A0_SRT_TIM_1900_40	Oh! Haha, really...?

A1_10100_DKWOMANMID01_200_1000	Thanks for your help before, Detective.
A1_10100_DKWOMANMID01_200_2000	I’ve decided I’m going to spend all of today just\nplaying with Lillipup.
A1_10100_TIM_200_1000	That sounds nice. I’m sure he’ll be happy.
A1_10100_PIKACHU_200_1000	Yeah, he told me that all he wants to do is play.
A1_10100_DKWOMANMID01_200_3000	Searching for Lillipup really tired me out, but playing\ntogether makes it easy to forget my exhaustion and\nhave fun!
A1_10100_DKWOMANMID01_300_1000	My Lillipup likes quiet places.
A1_10100_DKWOMANMID01_300_2000	I hope someone finds him soon...
A1_10110_YORTERRIE_400_1000	Lill...
A1_10110_TIM_400_1000	Say, Pikachu, isn’t this...
A1_10110_PIKACHU_400_1000	Yeah, it’s Lillipup.
A1_10110_PIKACHU_400_2000	It may indeed be the partner of that woman we met in\nfront of the Denis residence. Let’s ask.
A1_10110_PIKACHU_400_3000	Hey there, Lillipup. What are you doing way\nover here?
A1_10110_YORTERRIE_400_2000	Pup?
A1_10110_PIKACHU_400_4000	Hmm, I see...
A1_10110_PIKACHU_400_5000	Apparently he was having so much fun running\naround that he wasn’t paying attention to where\nhe was going. Next thing he knew, he was here.
A1_10110_TIM_400_2000	Just like that woman said earlier.
A1_10110_YORTERRIE_400_3000	Lil...
A1_10110_PIKACHU_400_6000	He says he misses his partner.
A1_10110_TIM_400_3000	OK! We’re gonna go tell her and bring her here to\nyou, Lillipup!
A1_10110_DKWOMANMID01_400_1000	Lillipup! I’m so glad you’ve been found!
A1_10110_YORTERRIE_400_4000	Pup pup!
A1_10110_DKWOMANMID01_400_2000	Thank you so much for finding my dear Lillipup,\nDetective!
A1_10110_TIM_400_4000	You’re welcome. I’m glad we could help.
A1_10110_YORTERRIE_400_5000	Lil...
A1_10110_DKWOMANMID01_400_3000	You ran away because you weren’t getting\nenough play time, didn’t you?
A1_10110_YORTERRIE_400_6000	Lil...
A1_10110_DKWOMANMID01_400_4000	All right, then... We can play together as much as you\nlike today!
A1_10110_YORTERRIE_400_7000	Pup pup!
A1_10110_PIKACHU_400_7000	Guess that’s settled.
A1_10110_TIM_400_5000	Yeah, it was nice to see them both so happy.
A1_10120_YORTERRIE_100_1000	Pup! Pup!
A1_10120_TIM_100_1000	Be careful not to get lost again, OK?
A1_10130_DKWOMANMID01_100_1000	Huh? You mean...you won’t help me?!
A1_10130_DCPOLICEWOMAN02_100_1000	I understand how you feel, ma’am, but we’re in the\nmiddle of an investigation right now...
A1_10130_DKWOMANMID01_100_2000	Yes, but...what should I do?
A1_10130_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like that woman has a problem.
A1_10130_TIM_100_1000	Sure does.
A1_10130_TIM_100_2000	I doubt it has anything to do with our case, but it’s\nhard not to want to help someone who’s in trouble.
A1_10130_PIKACHU_100_2000	That’s the spirit, Tim. If we see a person or a Pokémon\nwith a problem, let’s do what we can to help them.
A1_10130_PIKACHU_100_3000	That’s what makes us this city’s great detectives.
A1_10130_PIKACHU_100_4000	But we do need to prioritize our current case—this is\nsomething we can help with when we have time.
A1_10130_TIM_100_3000	Right. First, let’s hear what she has to say.
A1_10130_PIKACHU_100_5000	Good idea.
A1_10130_TIM_100_4000	Excuse me. May I ask what’s wrong?
A1_10130_DKWOMANMID01_100_3000	My Lillipup’s gone missing...
A1_10130_TIM_100_5000	Oh no! What happened?
A1_10130_DKWOMANMID01_100_4000	We were taking a walk together in Serenity Park.
A1_10130_DKWOMANMID01_100_5000	I guess Lillipup must’ve been having TOO much fun.\nHe got so worked up, he took off like a rocket...
A1_10130_DKWOMANMID01_100_6000	I’ve been searching all over for him, and now I’m\nexhausted.
A1_10130_DKWOMANMID01_100_7000	That police officer won’t look into it for me, either.\nI don’t know what to do...
A1_10130_TIM_100_6000	We can’t just ignore this.
A1_10130_PIKACHU_100_6000	That’s right. Helping people is a detective’s job—and\nfinding lost Pokémon even more so.
A1_10130_TIM_100_7000	We’d like to help you, ma’am. We’re detectives, so\nwe’re pretty good at looking for lost people and\nPokémon.
A1_10130_DKWOMANMID01_100_8000	Really? That would be a huge help!
A1_10130_TIM_100_8000	Can you think of anywhere your Lillipup might\nhave gone?
A1_10130_DKWOMANMID01_100_9000	Hmm... Well, I’ve already searched the park pretty\nthoroughly.
A1_10130_DKWOMANMID01_100_10000	But I haven’t looked for him in the city yet.
A1_10130_DKWOMANMID01_100_11000	Oh, also, my Lillipup likes quiet places. But I’m not\nsure there ARE any places like that around here.
A1_10130_TIM_100_9000	I think that’s enough information for us to go on!
A1_10130_TIM_100_10000	Please wait here while we search for him.
A1_10130_DKWOMANMID01_100_12000	I’m so sorry to add to your workload when you\nalready look so busy, but thank you! I hope you find\nmy sweet Lillipup!
A1_10130_PIKACHU_100_7000	If we see a Lillipup during our investigation, we\nshould talk to it.
A1_10200_ABURIBBON_400_1000	Booom!
A1_10200_PIKACHU_400_1000	It says thank you for finding the Cutiefly.
A1_10200_TIM_400_1000	That was all thanks to you and Growlithe.
A1_10200_ABURIBBON_500_1000	Bom bom bom!
A1_10200_TIM_500_1000	Wow, it looks really panicked.
A1_10200_PIKACHU_500_1000	It’s worried about its Cutiefly not returning.
A1_10200_PIKACHU_500_2000	I’ll need Growlithe’s help with this one.
A1_10200_TIM_600_1000	Oh look, a Ribombee.
A1_10200_PIKACHU_600_1000	Ribombee mix pollen and nectar to make all kinds of\ndifferent puffs.
A1_10200_ABURIBBON_600_1000	Booom bom!
A1_10200_TIM_600_2000	It sure seems busy.
A1_10200_ABURIBBON_600_2000	Bom booom!
A1_10200_PIKACHU_600_2000	Apparently it’s making pollen puffs for its Cutiefly\nto eat.
A1_10200_PIKACHU_600_3000	Those little bugs have big appetites while they’re\ngrowing up, so it’s got to prepare a ton of food.
A1_10200_TIM_600_3000	Sounds like a lot of work. Let’s just watch and try not\nto get in the way.
A1_10200_ABURIBBON_700_1000	Booom bom!
A1_10200_PIKACHU_700_1000	It says it’s busy making pollen puffs.
A1_10200_TIM_800_1000	Oh look, a Ribombee.
A1_10200_PIKACHU_800_1000	Ribombee mix pollen and nectar to make all kinds of\ndifferent puffs.
A1_10200_ABURIBBON_800_1000	Booom bom!
A1_10200_TIM_800_2000	It sure seems busy.
A1_10200_ABURIBBON_800_2000	Bom booom!
A1_10200_PIKACHU_800_2000	Apparently it’s making pollen puffs for its Cutiefly\nto eat.
A1_10200_PIKACHU_800_3000	Those little bugs have big appetites while they’re\ngrowing up, so it’s got to prepare a ton of food.
A1_10200_TIM_800_3000	Sounds like a lot of work. Let’s just watch and try not\nto get in the way.
A1_1030_TIM_100_1000	OK, let’s go, Pikachu.
A1_1030_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wait a second, Tim.
A1_1030_TIM_100_2000	What for?
A1_1030_PIKACHU_100_2000	There’s no need to rush.
A1_1030_PIKACHU_100_3000	You’ve gotta be calm and unhurried if you want to do\nyour best investigating.
A1_1030_TIM_100_3000	Yeah, I guess that’s true.
A1_10300_DKBOY01_200_1000	I want you to put some real heat on this next\npass, Raboot!
A1_10300_TIM_200_1000	Wow, they’re really fired up! I bet their next match\ncan’t come soon enough.
A1_10300_DKBOY01_300_1000	Did you find a Pokémon that’s good at soccer?
A1_10300_TIM_300_1000	I’m sorry, we’re still looking.
A1_10300_DKBOY01_400_1000	*sigh* This is real bad.
A1_10300_PIKACHU_400_1000	Hm? That boy looks pretty down.
A1_10300_TIM_400_1000	Sorry to bother you, but is everything OK? You look\nunhappy about something.
A1_10300_DKBOY01_400_2000	Oh! You’re the detective and Pikachu I saw on TV!
A1_10300_DKBOY01_400_3000	Awesome! A detective’s just what I need!
A1_10300_TIM_400_2000	Can you tell us what’s bothering you?
A1_10300_DKBOY01_400_4000	Well, we’ve got a match coming up against the\nTahnti Park Soccer Club.
A1_10300_PIKACHU_400_2000	Huh. I didn’t know Tahnti Park even had a\nsoccer club.
A1_10300_DKBOY01_400_5000	One of their members has a Scrafty as their partner,\nand they’re SO. GOOD.
A1_10300_DKBOY01_400_6000	So I’m worried we’re gonna lose.
A1_10300_DKBOY01_400_7000	I want a partner Pokémon I can play with too!
A1_10300_DKBOY01_400_8000	But I can’t find any Pokémon that’re good at soccer...
A1_10300_PIKACHU_400_3000	Gotcha. Sounds like we’d better search for a Pokémon\nwith good footwork.
A1_10300_DKBOY01_400_9000	Can you think of any Pokémon that can play soccer\nreally well, Mr. Detective?
A1_10300_TIM_400_3000	Hmm, none immediately spring to mind. But I’ll be\nsure to tell you if I find one.
A1_10300_DKBOY01_400_10000	Really?! Thanks, Mr. Detective!
A1_10300_PIKACHU_400_4000	I sure hope we can find a Pokémon that likes playing\nsoccer. There’s gotta be one somewhere in Ryme City.
A1_10310_PIKACHU_400_1000	Oh, it’s a Raboot. What are you up to?
A1_10310_RABBIFUTO_400_1000	Raboo.
A1_10310_PIKACHU_400_2000	You’re just about to do some dribbling practice here\nby yourself?
A1_10310_TIM_400_1000	Dribbling practice?
A1_10310_PIKACHU_400_3000	Yeah, Raboot are really good at that kinda footwork.\nThey’re always practicing.
A1_10310_TIM_400_2000	In that case, Raboot might be willing to join some\nsoccer games.
A1_10310_PIKACHU_400_4000	You’re right! And this one says it’s got some really\nimpressive techniques!
A1_10310_PIKACHU_400_5000	Hey, Raboot. I know a kid that’d love to kick a ball\naround with you.
A1_10310_PIKACHU_400_6000	If you’ve got some time, would you be willing to play\nwith him?
A1_10310_RABBIFUTO_400_2000	Raboo!
A1_10310_PIKACHU_400_7000	You will? Great!
A1_10310_TIM_400_3000	That’s great! I’ll go get him!
A1_10310_RABBIFUTO_400_3000	Rab raaab!
A1_10310_DKBOY01_400_1000	Those eyes... Th-they look really fired up!\nThis Pokémon is the coolest, Mr. Detective!
A1_10310_TIM_400_4000	Try talking to it. I’m sure it’ll be willing to practice\nwith you.
A1_10310_DKBOY01_400_2000	Really? Hey, Raboot! Wanna play soccer with me?!
A1_10310_RABBIFUTO_400_4000	Raboo... Rab raboo!
A1_10310_DKBOY01_400_3000	It nodded! Thank you, Raboot!
A1_10310_DKBOY01_400_4000	OK, let’s get this practice started! We’re gonna win\nthe match for sure now!
A1_10310_TIM_400_5000	Good luck—hope you do well!
A1_10310_DKBOY01_400_5000	Thanks!
A1_10310_DKBOY01_400_6000	I hope we can be friends, Raboot!
A1_10310_RABBIFUTO_400_5000	Rab rab!
A1_10310_PIKACHU_400_8000	I guess soccer players don’t need words to hit it off\nwhen they share a love of the game.
A1_10310_TIM_400_6000	Yeah, even without speaking the same language,\nthey seemed to understand each other’s feelings.
A1_10310_PIKACHU_500_1000	It’s Raboot, a Pokémon known for its excellent\nfootwork.
A1_10310_RABBIFUTO_500_1000	Rab rab.
A1_10310_TIM_500_1000	What’s it saying, Pikachu?
A1_10310_PIKACHU_500_2000	It wants us to be quiet, because it’s trying to think up\na practice routine.
A1_10310_TIM_500_2000	Oh, I see. Let’s leave it alone, then.
A1_10320_RABBIFUTO_100_1000	Raboo!
A1_10320_TIM_100_1000	Raboot’s not holding anything back!
A1_10320_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m sure they’re both happy they found each other.
A1_1040_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, don’t ignore me!
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_200_1000	Quiz ya later!
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_300_1000	So did you figure out the answer to my final question?
A1_10400_TIM_300_1000	I think so. The answer is Falinks, right?
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_300_2000	Bingo! That’s it!
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_300_3000	Falinks is a very peculiar Pokémon. There are actually\nsix of them working together as one.
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_300_4000	The one at the front, known as the brass, leads the\nothers by issuing orders.
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_300_5000	In battle, they change formation as needed and use\nteamwork to secure the win!
A1_10400_TIM_300_2000	That’s a pretty interesting Pokémon.
A1_10400_PIKACHU_300_1000	Sure, but I bet it’s tough for the troopers if they’ve\ngot an incompetent brass.
A1_10400_DODEKABASHI_300_1000	Canno!
A1_10400_PIKACHU_300_2000	Yeah, sorry. I’m sure they’re all perfectly competent.
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_300_6000	That’s all for today’s quiz!
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_300_7000	I hope you’re as enthusiastic about quizzes and\nPoké-facts as I am!
A1_10400_TIM_300_3000	Yes, I learned a lot.
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_300_8000	Glad to hear it! I’ll get some new questions ready for\nnext time!
A1_10400_TIM_300_4000	Oh. OK. Please let them be easy ones...
A1_10400_PIKACHU_300_3000	And maybe she could, y’know, wait till we’re not in\nthe middle of something.
A1_10400_DODEKABASHI_300_2000	Canno.
A1_10400_PIKACHU_300_4000	Yeah. See ya, Toucannon.
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_400_1000	Best buds always stick together—what Pokémon\nmoves as a group?
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_400_2000	Let me know when you figure out the answer!
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_500_1000	So, Detective, did you figure out the answer to the\nsecond question?
A1_10400_TIM_500_1000	Yeah. The answer is Purrloin, right?
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_500_2000	Ding-ding-ding! That’s correct!
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_500_3000	Purrloin often steal things from people.
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_500_4000	And they sometimes scratch people who try to reclaim\nthose stolen items, so be careful of their claws.
A1_10400_PIKACHU_500_1000	The Purrloin we met wasn’t THAT rowdy.
A1_10400_TIM_500_2000	But we should probably be careful in the future.
A1_10400_PIKACHU_500_2000	True. Better safe than sorry.
A1_10400_DODEKABASHI_500_1000	Canno?
A1_10400_PIKACHU_500_3000	It’s asking if we agree that quizzes can actually be\npretty fun.
A1_10400_TIM_500_3000	They’re certainly a chance to learn more about\nPokémon.
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_500_5000	OK, let the quiz continue! Time for question three!
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_500_6000	Best buds always stick together—what Pokémon\nmoves as a group?
A1_10400_TIM_500_4000	A Pokémon that moves as a group... Like one that\ntravels in herds or flocks or something?
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_500_7000	Nope. In this case, the whole group counts as one\nPokémon!
A1_10400_TIM_500_5000	Is that even a thing...?
A1_10400_PIKACHU_500_4000	Can you give us a hint, Toucannon?
A1_10400_DODEKABASHI_500_2000	Canno.
A1_10400_PIKACHU_500_5000	Hmph. Well, that’s not very sporting.
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_500_8000	This Pokémon has quite the unique appearance. Go\nahead and see if you can find it!
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_600_1000	What Pokémon uses its cute looks to put you off your\nguard so it can steal from you?
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_600_2000	Let me know when you figure out the answer!
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_700_1000	So, Detective, did you figure out the answer to my\nfirst question?
A1_10400_TIM_700_1000	I sure did. It’s Lickitung, right?
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_700_2000	Bingo! Yes, you got it!
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_700_3000	Lickitung uses its looong tongue to catch its prey.
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_700_4000	According to reports, contact with its saliva causes a\ntingling sensation—as well as a persistent itch.
A1_10400_TIM_700_2000	Oh, wow. Good thing we didn’t get licked!
A1_10400_PIKACHU_700_1000	Ugh, I’m feeling itchy just imagining it...
A1_10400_DODEKABASHI_700_1000	Canno.
A1_10400_PIKACHU_700_2000	Thanks for the warning, Toucannon. We’ll make sure\nany Lickitung we meet keeps its tongue to itself.
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_700_5000	Well, that was only the first question. I guess it was a\nlittle too easy.
A1_10400_TIM_700_3000	Are you saying there’s more...?
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_700_6000	Of course! And here’s where they get serious—time\nfor question number two!
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_700_7000	What Pokémon uses its cute looks to put you off your\nguard so it can steal from you?
A1_10400_PIKACHU_700_3000	Hey, we don’t have time to deal with ANOTHER theft!
A1_10400_TIM_700_4000	Hmm... What Pokémon tries to steal from people?
A1_10400_PIKACHU_700_4000	I think the “cute looks” part is our biggest hint.
A1_10400_DODEKABASHI_700_2000	... ... ...
A1_10400_PIKACHU_700_5000	Pretty sure it’s not you, Toucannon.
A1_10400_DODEKABASHI_700_3000	Canno.
A1_10400_PIKACHU_700_6000	Totally. OK, Tim, let’s go search the area.
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_800_1000	What Pokémon catches prey using its looong tongue?
A1_10400_WOMANQUIZ_800_2000	The Pokémon in question is somewhere in this very\ncity, so get out there and look for it!
A1_10410_BERORINGA_400_1000	Liiick!
A1_10410_TIM_400_1000	What do you think this Lickitung is doing in a place\nlike this?
A1_10410_PIKACHU_400_1000	Looking for a snack, I imagine. As soon as she finds\nsomething, she’ll probably start lickin’ away.
A1_10410_BERORINGA_500_1000	Liiick!
A1_10410_TIM_500_1000	That’s a looong tongue. I’m amazed it stretches\nso far!
A1_10410_PIKACHU_500_1000	Say, Tim, this Lickitung might be the answer to that\nquiz question.
A1_10410_TIM_500_2000	I think you’re right. Let’s go tell the quiz professor.
A1_10410_BERORINGA_600_1000	Lick lick!
A1_10410_TIM_600_1000	What a long tongue.
A1_10420_CHORONEKO_400_1000	Purr purrr!
A1_10420_TIM_400_1000	Your thieving days are over, got it?
A1_10420_CHORONEKO_500_1000	Purrr! ♪
A1_10420_TIM_500_1000	What a cute Pokémon.
A1_10420_PIKACHU_500_1000	That’s a Purrloin.
A1_10420_CHORONEKO_500_2000	Purrr! ♪
A1_10420_TIM_500_2000	Awww, how sweet! I think it wants some attention.
A1_10420_TIM_500_3000	Sorry, we’re busy now, but we can play with you later.
A1_10420_PIKACHU_500_2000	Hold up, Tim—check your pockets!
A1_10420_TIM_500_4000	Why would I need to check my—?
A1_10420_TIM_500_5000	Wait, what?! My pen’s gone!
A1_10420_PIKACHU_500_3000	I thought so. This is your doing, isn’t it, Purrloin?
A1_10420_PIKACHU_500_4000	Can’t pull one over on a great detective like me.\nNow hand it over—paws where we can see ’em.
A1_10420_CHORONEKO_500_3000	Purrr...
A1_10420_TIM_500_6000	Oh, my pen!
A1_10420_PIKACHU_500_5000	Wow. You can’t take your eyes off this Purrloin for\na second.
A1_10420_TIM_500_7000	Yeah, that was a close one.
A1_10420_PIKACHU_500_6000	But at least we figured out the answer to the quiz\nquestion.
A1_10420_TIM_500_8000	Right—it’s Purrloin. Let’s go tell the quiz professor!
A1_10420_CHORONEKO_600_1000	Purr! Purr purrr! ♪
A1_10420_TIM_600_1000	This Pokémon is being awfully friendly!
A1_10430_TAIRETSU_400_1000	Links! Links!
A1_10430_TIM_400_1000	I wonder if Falinks ever want to split up and move\naround separately.
A1_10430_PIKACHU_400_1000	Doubt it—I’ve only ever seen them together.
A1_10430_TAIRETSU_500_1000	Links!
A1_10430_TIM_500_1000	Wow... Those movements are in perfect unison.
A1_10430_PIKACHU_500_1000	That’s Falinks. They always move around in groups\nof six.
A1_10430_TAIRETSU_500_2000	Links! Li liii!
A1_10430_PIKACHU_500_2000	They’re in the middle of formation training.
A1_10430_TIM_500_2000	Pikachu, do you think Falinks is the Pokémon the quiz\nprofessor was talking about?
A1_10430_PIKACHU_500_3000	Six working together as one—yep, that fits the bill.
A1_10430_TIM_500_3000	Then let’s go tell her the answer!
A1_10430_TAIRETSU_600_1000	Links! Li!
A1_10430_TIM_600_1000	There sure are a lot of amazing Pokémon around—\nthese ones are so well coordinated!
A1_10440_NONAMEWOMANQUIZ_100_1000	How wonderful to meet you, Detective! Seriously, it’s\nan honor!
A1_10440_TIM_100_1000	Uh, yeah, nice to meet you too. Can I help you, or...?
A1_10440_NONAMEWOMANQUIZ_100_2000	Huh? Do you really not know who I am? I’m kind of a\nbig deal on the Ryme University campus—and I know\nyou go to school there too!
A1_10440_PIKACHU_100_1000	Know anything about this so-called big deal, Tim?
A1_10440_TIM_100_2000	Not that I can think of...
A1_10440_WOMANQUIZ_100_3000	They call me the quiz professor! I’m actually still a\nstudent, but that’s what they call me!
A1_10440_WOMANQUIZ_100_4000	And this is my partner, Toucannon!
A1_10440_TIM_100_3000	So you’re, uh, the quiz professor...
A1_10440_WOMANQUIZ_100_5000	That’s me! I’m majoring in Pokémon studies.
A1_10440_WOMANQUIZ_100_6000	I can’t resist sharing the knowledge I’ve learned, so I\nquiz all sorts of people!
A1_10440_PIKACHU_100_2000	That explains the nickname. This “quiz professor” is\ndefinitely on the eccentric side.
A1_10440_DODEKABASHI_100_1000	Canno canno!
A1_10440_PIKACHU_100_3000	I’ll admit, ya got me there. A Pikachu doing detective\nwork is pretty eccentric too.
A1_10440_WOMANQUIZ_100_7000	Why don’t we celebrate our meeting with a quiz?
A1_10440_TIM_100_4000	Umm, we’re pretty busy working on a case right now...
A1_10440_WOMANQUIZ_100_8000	OK, here’s the first question!
A1_10440_PIKACHU_100_4000	In one ear and out the other... Ah well, guess it can’t\nhurt to play along.
A1_10440_TIM_100_5000	I guess... Here goes nothing.
A1_10440_WOMANQUIZ_100_9000	What Pokémon catches prey using its looong\ntongue?
A1_10440_WOMANQUIZ_100_10000	The Pokémon in question is somewhere in this very\ncity, so get out there and look for it!
A1_10440_PIKACHU_100_5000	What’s your tongue like, Toucannon? Mind opening\nup that beak of yours?
A1_10440_DODEKABASHI_100_2000	Canno.
A1_10440_PIKACHU_100_6000	Nothing extraordinary here. Thanks, anyway.
A1_10440_TIM_100_6000	A Pokémon with a long tongue, huh? If there’s one\nnearby, it shouldn’t take too long for us to find.
A1_10440_WOMANQUIZ_100_11000	When you find the Pokémon in question, come tell me\nwhat it is—I’ll be waiting right here!
A1_10440_WOMANQUIZ_100_12000	Answer correctly, and I’ll even teach you some trivia\nabout it!
A1_1050_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, but Holiday’s waiting... We better go join him!
A1_10510_USOKKIE_100_1000	Woodooo!
A1_10510_TIM_100_1000	Whoa! I was just thinking this was an odd place for a\ntree, but it’s actually a Pokémon?!
A1_10510_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, that’s a Sudowoodo. They have a habit of\npretending to be trees.
A1_10510_USOKKIE_100_2000	Sudo sudo!
A1_10510_PIKACHU_100_2000	You’re practicing your tree imitation, huh?
A1_10510_TIM_100_2000	Does it have to practice right here? Seems like it’ll\nblock a lot of foot traffic.
A1_10510_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yeah, true.
A1_10510_PIKACHU_100_4000	Hey, Sudowoodo—if you wanna practice, you should\ntry doing it somewhere else.
A1_10510_PIKACHU_100_5000	This location totally blows your cover.
A1_10510_USOKKIE_100_3000	S-sudo?! Woodo...
A1_10510_TIM_100_3000	That sure seemed to send it into a panic...
A1_10510_PIKACHU_100_6000	I guess it thought it was blending in perfectly.
A1_10600_TIM_100_1000	Something’s shining in the fountain—what could it be?
A1_10600_MAAIIKA_100_1000	Inkay!
A1_10600_TIM_100_2000	Whoa! I knew I saw something—it was a Pokémon?
A1_10600_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s an Inkay, Tim.
A1_10600_PIKACHU_100_2000	It lights up its spots to communicate with friends.
A1_10600_PIKACHU_100_3000	Never figured it’d use those lights to lure someone in\nclose enough for a prank!
A1_10600_TIM_100_3000	Yeah, it definitely surprised me!
A1_10600_MAAIIKA_100_2000	Inkay! Inkay!
A1_10600_PIKACHU_100_4000	Hey, Inkay—maybe go easy on the jump scares, OK?
A1_10610_MAAIIKA_100_1000	Kay! Inkay!
A1_10610_TIM_100_1000	Try not to let your pranks go too far, all right?
A1_10700_MAHOMIL_200_1000	Mil mil!
A1_10700_TIM_200_1000	I’ll be back soon for that coffee!
A1_10700_MAHOMIL_300_1000	Mil mil!
A1_10700_PIKACHU_300_1000	Oh, it’s a Milcery.
A1_10700_TIM_300_1000	Hey Pablo, got a new customer?
A1_10700_PABLO_300_1000	Oh, you mean this Milcery? It’s new—just started\nliving here, in fact! Wonder what sorta place it’s\nfrom...
A1_10700_MAHOMIL_300_2000	Mil mil!
A1_10700_PABLO_300_2000	Whoa, hey, hold on, Milcery—both Tim and Pikachu\nhave particular blends they prefer.
A1_10700_PABLO_300_3000	You can’t just add cream without asking!
A1_10700_MAHOMIL_300_3000	Mil? Mil mil...
A1_10700_PIKACHU_300_2000	I’d prefer to keep my coffee black, but why don’t you\ntry some cream, Tim?
A1_10700_TIM_300_2000	Sure, and it smells great! I’ll give it a try next time.
A1_10700_MAHOMIL_300_4000	Mil mil! Mil!
A1_1080_HOLIDAY_100_1000	I appreciate you coming on such short notice, Tim.
A1_1080_HOLIDAY_100_2000	This way—the crime took place at the Denis residence\nup ahead.
A1_1090_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Tim. That’s not the way to the crime scene.
A1_1100_PIKACHU_100_1000	As much as I hate to admit it, we don’t have time to\ndrink coffee right now.
A1_11010_DCBOY01_100_1000	Aw, c’mon! Lickitung stopped AGAIN?!
A1_11010_DCBOY01_100_2000	She keeps getting distracted!
A1_11020_DAWOMAN01_100_1000	This is a fountain for Pokémon to drink from.
A1_11020_DAWOMAN01_100_2000	My Tsareena really loves the water here.
A1_11030_DABUSINESSWOMAN01_100_1000	Someone seems to have planted a tree right in the\nmiddle of the path.
A1_11030_DABUSINESSWOMAN01_100_2000	It’s such an inconvenience!
A1_11035_DABUSINESSWOMAN01_100_1000	Huh? Someone must’ve replanted that tree in the\nflower bed...but when?
A1_11050_DHGIRL01_100_1000	Great job, Maractus! Your dancing is so cute!
A1_11050_DHGIRL01_100_2000	From the top! One, two, one, two...
A1_11050_MARACACCHI_100_1000	Maraca raca!
A1_1110_NYOROBON_100_1000	Rath!
A1_1110_HARITEYAMA_100_1000	Hariiiya!
A1_1110_PIKACHU_100_1000	A Poliwrath and a Hariyama. They’re squaring off...\nYou could cut the tension with a knife.
A1_1110_TIM_100_1000	It looks like a fight could break out any second...
A1_1110_PIKACHU_100_2000	We should probably avoid this alley so we don’t\naccidentally set them off.
A1_1110_NYOROBON_200_1000	Rath rath!
A1_1110_HARITEYAMA_200_1000	Hariiiya!
A1_1110_PIKACHU_200_1000	This way doesn’t look too safe. Let’s steer clear\nfor now.
A1_1115_DAGIRL01_100_1000	Oh no, Hariyama’s facing off against Poliwrath\nagain...
A1_1115_DAGIRL01_100_2000	Why does he act out like this? He’s usually so gentle!
A1_1115_TIM_100_1000	Is something wrong?
A1_1115_DAGIRL01_100_3000	My partner Hariyama loves showing off his strength—\nespecially when he can test it against someone else’s.
A1_1115_DAGIRL01_100_4000	And since Poliwrath is also proud of its muscles,\nHariyama considers it his rival.
A1_1115_DAGIRL01_100_5000	Once they start going at it, it’s hard to stop them.
A1_1115_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yikes. Guess we’d better avoid that alley for now.
A1_1120_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Tim. That’s not the way to the crime scene.
A1_1215_TIM_100_1000	It’s been a while, Brad.
A1_1215_TIM_100_2000	I see you’re on the case too.
A1_1215_BRAD_100_1000	I suppose that means you are as well. You private\ndetectives do love sticking your noses into every\nlittle thing...
A1_1215_BRAD_100_2000	If Mr. Denis hadn’t requested you personally, I’d be\nasking you to leave right now.
A1_1215_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yep—he’s still a jerk.
A1_1215_PIKACHU_100_2000	Think he’s still holding a grudge from that time\nwe showed him up?
A1_1215_LIVOLT01_100_1000	Manec!
A1_1215_PIKACHU_100_3000	He says no funny business.
A1_1215_PIKACHU_100_4000	Sheesh! No wonder you two are partners!
A1_1215_HOLIDAY_100_1000	That’s enough, Brad. We’re going to be conducting\nthis investigation together.
A1_1215_TIM_100_3000	This is the scene of the crime, right?
A1_1215_BRAD_100_3000	Yes, this mansion belongs to Sanjeev Denis, a jeweler.
A1_1230_BRAD_100_1000	Mr. Denis is one of the wealthiest men in Ryme City.
A1_1230_BRAD_100_2000	Under normal circumstances, a civilian like yourself\nwould never have the opportunity to meet him.
A1_1230_BRAD_100_3000	Make sure you don’t do anything to offend him. Oh,\nand don’t get in the way of our investigation, either.
A1_1230_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s just got to get a dig in somewhere, doesn’t he?
A1_1230_HOLIDAY_100_1000	OK, Tim, come inside.
A1_1311_HOLIDAY_100_1000	All right, Tim, Mr. Denis is waiting for you in the room\nto the right.
A1_1311_TIM_100_1000	Thanks, Inspector Holiday.
A1_1314_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s not the way to the room Holiday mentioned.
A1_1316_HOLIDAY_100_1000	The parlor is to the right. Mr. Denis is waiting there.
A1_1316_HOLIDAY_100_2000	We appreciate the help, Tim.
A1_1330_DENIS_100_1000	My name is Sanjeev Denis. I’m a jeweler. And this is\nmy partner, Growlithe.
A1_1330_GARDIE_100_1000	Growl...
A1_1330_TIM_100_1000	I’m Detective Tim Goodman, and this is my partner,\nPikachu.
A1_1330_TIM_100_2000	Sorry to jump right into it, but could you please tell us\nwhat you know about the incident?
A1_1330_DENIS_200_1000	Ask me anything you like.
A1_1330_SEL_0_1000	About the crime that took place...
A1_1330_SEL_0_2000	About your trusted butler...
A1_1330_SEL_0_3000	About the “symbol of revival...”
A1_1330_SEL_0_4000	About Growlithe’s food...
A1_1330_DENIS_300_1000	A precious jewel was stolen while I was out of\nthe house...
A1_1330_DENIS_300_2000	It’s called the Aurora Drop, and it’s a very rare jewel\nindeed!
A1_1330_TIM_300_1000	The Aurora Drop...
A1_1330_PIKACHU_300_1000	What a mysterious name—magical, even.
A1_1330_DENIS_300_3000	<color=#F39800FF>The thief injured one of my staff members and made\noff with the jewel.</color>
A1_1330_DENIS_300_4000	Thankfully, my staff member’s injuries were minor.\nAnd yet...
A1_1330_TIM_300_2000	Is something sticking out to you as odd?
A1_1330_DENIS_300_5000	Well, the police are treating my trusted butler as the\nprime suspect.
A1_1330_PIKACHU_300_2000	They think the butler did it?
A1_1330_TIM_300_3000	Could you tell me a bit more about the stolen jewel?
A1_1330_DENIS_300_6000	It looks like this.
A1_1330_DENIS_300_7000	Most gemstones must first be cut and polished into\nbeautiful jewels.
A1_1330_DENIS_300_8000	But the Aurora Drop is said to have naturally formed\ninto its shape.
A1_1330_TIM_300_4000	The way it shines looks a bit like an aurora.
A1_1330_DENIS_300_9000	Yes, that’s precisely how it got its name.
A1_1330_DENIS_300_10000	The Aurora Drop has been the subject of many a tale,\nbut it was thought to be nothing more than fiction...
A1_1330_DENIS_300_11000	Even among us jewelers, for the longest time we\ncalled it the Jewel of Legend.
A1_1330_PIKACHU_300_3000	Wow, he wasn’t kidding when he called it precious.\nGuess it’s no surprise that someone wanted to steal it.
A1_1330_TIM_300_5000	It definitely sounds valuable. Where were you\ndisplaying it?
A1_1330_DENIS_300_12000	I kept it securely locked within a special reinforced\ncase inside my jewel storage room.
A1_1330_DENIS_300_13000	There are locks on both the storage room door and\nthe reinforced case.
A1_1330_TIM_300_6000	And yet, despite all that security, it still got stolen...
A1_1330_TIM_400_1000	You mentioned that the police already have a suspect.
A1_1330_DENIS_400_1000	Yes. They believe that the thief is my own trusted\nbutler, Barnes.
A1_1330_TIM_400_2000	Why do they think that?
A1_1330_DENIS_400_2000	Because Barnes and I are the only people who can\naccess the key to the storage room.
A1_1330_TIM_400_3000	What’s keeping someone else from getting to it?
A1_1330_DENIS_400_3000	The key is always kept around Growlithe’s neck.
A1_1330_DENIS_400_4000	If anyone but Barnes or myself attempted to take it\nfrom her, Growlithe would start barking.
A1_1330_DENIS_400_5000	My Growlithe is a very loyal Pokémon. She would\nnever allow the key to be taken by a stranger.
A1_1330_TIM_400_4000	I don’t see a key around Growlithe’s neck right now.
A1_1330_DENIS_400_6000	The police think Barnes took it.
A1_1330_PIKACHU_400_1000	That would certainly make sense—assuming Barnes\nreally is the culprit.
A1_1330_TIM_400_5000	Mr. Denis? If possible, I’d like to talk with Barnes.
A1_1330_DENIS_400_7000	He’s currently being questioned by the police.
A1_1330_TIM_400_6000	But you don’t believe Barnes is the thief...\nIs that correct?
A1_1330_DENIS_400_8000	I’ve known Barnes since we were young. He’s worked\nin this home for years and has always served us well.
A1_1330_DENIS_400_9000	I’m certain that he’d never steal from me.
A1_1330_DENIS_400_10000	And I couldn’t possibly imagine him hurting anyone.
A1_1330_TIM_400_7000	So you’re saying Barnes didn’t do it, and the real\nculprit is still at large?
A1_1330_DENIS_400_11000	That’s right. Someone else must have stolen the jewel.\nPlease help me prove that Barnes is innocent!
A1_1330_PIKACHU_400_2000	Ah, so that’s why he called us here: to clear his\nbutler’s name.
A1_1330_TIM_400_8000	We’ll talk to Barnes later.
A1_1330_TIM_500_1000	What makes the Aurora Drop a “symbol of revival”?
A1_1330_DENIS_500_1000	Two years ago, during the R incident...my jewel shop\nsuffered considerable damage.
A1_1330_TIM_500_2000	Wait, you were a victim of the R incident?
A1_1330_DENIS_500_2000	Yes. Some Pokémon who’d been exposed to R\nwent berserk...
A1_1330_DENIS_500_3000	Their rampage destroyed my shop, to say nothing\nof the damage done to my jewels and other goods.
A1_1330_DENIS_500_4000	By that time, I already had the Aurora Drop—I kept it\nstored safely in the shop.
A1_1330_TIM_500_3000	So was the Aurora Drop damaged too?
A1_1330_DENIS_500_5000	No, as a matter of fact, it wasn’t.
A1_1330_DENIS_500_6000	Of all the jewels in my shop, the Aurora Drop was the\nonly one to remain unscathed.
A1_1330_DENIS_500_7000	In fact, debris fell so perfectly around the Aurora\nDrop that you might believe it was being protected!
A1_1330_TIM_500_4000	That’s incredible!
A1_1330_PIKACHU_500_1000	I guess there’s some magic left in the world after all.
A1_1330_DENIS_500_8000	Ever since then, the Aurora Drop became known as\nThe Jewel That Survived the R Incident.
A1_1330_DENIS_500_9000	People started visiting my shop just to see it.
A1_1330_DENIS_500_10000	And thanks to all that attention, my business was able\nto get back on its feet.
A1_1330_TIM_500_5000	Sounds like a valuable jewel—in more ways than one.\nWhat made you decide to bring it back to your\nmansion instead of keeping it at your shop?
A1_1330_DENIS_500_11000	I’d decided to donate it to Ryme City.
A1_1330_TIM_500_6000	The Aurora Drop? But why donate something so\nprecious to you?
A1_1330_DENIS_500_12000	It’s not just precious to ME, and that’s exactly why\nI’d decided to donate it!
A1_1330_DENIS_500_13000	Mayor Myers has done his part in improving our city\nby declaring the start of Pokémon Friendship Week.\nI thought it was about time I did mine.
A1_1330_DENIS_500_14000	So I wanted to donate The Jewel That Survived the\nR Incident as a symbol of Ryme City’s revival.
A1_1330_DENIS_500_15000	I hope that by doing so, I can help liven up not just\nmy shop, but the whole city as well!
A1_1330_PIKACHU_500_2000	Wow, Denis. I’m impressed.
A1_1330_TIM_500_7000	That’s a wonderful gesture.
A1_1330_DENIS_500_16000	I’m glad you think so. Not everyone is so pleased\nabout it.
A1_1330_TIM_500_8000	Oh?
A1_1330_DENIS_500_17000	Ah, forget I said anything. I shouldn’t burden you with\nconcern over such personal matters.
A1_1330_DENIS_500_18000	For now, I’m counting on you to find the Aurora Drop\nas quickly as possible.
A1_1330_TIM_500_9000	Understood. We’ll do everything we can.
A1_1330_DENIS_600_1000	<color=#F39800FF>My staff member Turner always prepares the\nfood here.</color>
A1_1330_DENIS_600_2000	It used to be one of Barnes’s duties, but the task has\nfallen to Turner since he joined the staff.
A1_1330_DENIS_600_3000	He’s truly made himself quite useful!
A1_1335_TIM_100_1000	So, finding the Aurora Drop and clearing Barnes\nof suspicion...
A1_1335_TIM_100_2000	Those are the two things you called us here to do?
A1_1335_DENIS_100_1000	Could you please? You’re the only ones I can\ncount on.
A1_1335_TIM_100_3000	Our job is to investigate the case and reveal the truth.
A1_1335_TIM_100_4000	We won’t know if Barnes is truly innocent until we\nlook into this more.
A1_1335_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, the police must have at least SOME reason\nto suspect him...
A1_1335_TIM_100_5000	But we’ll do what we can. If that’s acceptable to you,\nwe’ll take the case.
A1_1335_DENIS_100_2000	That’s more than acceptable. Thank you, Tim.
A1_1335_TIM_100_6000	Great. In that case, may I start investigating the scene\nof the crime?
A1_1335_DENIS_100_3000	Of course. The jewel storage room is just upstairs.\nI know you won’t let me down.
A1_1335_PIKACHU_100_2000	Wait a second, Tim.
A1_1335_PIKACHU_100_3000	There’s something I wanna try, starting with this case.
A1_1335_TIM_100_7000	Something you want to try?
A1_1335_PIKACHU_100_4000	Yeah, a case notebook. The writers for Detective\nJournal swear by it.
A1_1335_TIM_100_8000	Detective Journal... That’s the magazine you’re always\nreading, right?
A1_1335_PIKACHU_100_5000	Yeah, that’s the one.
A1_1335_PIKACHU_100_6000	They researched the most efficient way for detectives\nto organize their case notes.
A1_1335_PIKACHU_100_7000	The solution they came up with was a case notebook.
A1_1335_TIM_100_9000	Sounds intriguing. How does it work?
A1_1335_PIKACHU_100_8000	I’m getting to that. First, open up your notebook.
A1_1336_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s open up the case notebook before moving on to\nthe crime scene.
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_100_1000	I take it you’ve heard what Mr. Denis has to say.
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_100_2000	I’m guessing he also told you about his butler.
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_100_3000	He’s definitely not pleased that Barnes has fallen\nunder suspicion.
A1_1350_TIM_100_1000	It sure seems that way...
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_100_4000	In my position, I’m not at liberty to share all the\ninformation we’ve gathered.
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_100_5000	But if there’s anything I can do to help, just let\nme know.
A1_1350_TIM_100_2000	Thank you.
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_200_1000	Ask anything you want, Tim.
A1_1350_SEL_0_1000	At the time of the incident...
A1_1350_SEL_0_2000	About Barnes...
A1_1350_SEL_0_3000	About the Aurora Drop...
A1_1350_SEL_0_4000	About my dad...
A1_1350_TIM_300_1000	What was the situation in the mansion at the time of\nthe incident?
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_300_1000	We’re still looking into that.
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_300_2000	I’m sure you’ll get more direct answers by asking the\nwitnesses themselves.
A1_1350_PIKACHU_300_1000	He’s right—we should take this one step at a time and\ngather our own intel.
A1_1350_TIM_400_1000	I was told Barnes is the police’s prime suspect.
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_400_1000	Well, the circumstantial evidence certainly seems to\nbe pointing in his direction...
A1_1350_PIKACHU_400_1000	He doesn’t sound terribly convinced.
A1_1350_TIM_400_2000	Does anything strike you as odd?
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_400_2000	Yes, actually. I can’t think of a single motive for\nBarnes to steal that jewel.
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_400_3000	He doesn’t appear to bear any ill will toward\nMr. Denis, and he’s in no trouble financially...
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_400_4000	That being said, we may uncover a motive in the\ncourse of our investigation.
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_400_5000	But for now, I can’t say anything with certainty.
A1_1350_TIM_400_3000	Understood...
A1_1350_TIM_500_1000	I hear the Aurora Drop is an incredibly valuable jewel.
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_500_1000	The Aurora Drop’s not just valuable—it’s famous\nthroughout the entire jewelry industry.
A1_1350_TIM_500_2000	Then there must be plenty of people who’d like to\nget their hands on it.
A1_1350_TIM_500_3000	Could the jewel have been stolen by an intruder?
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_500_2000	I can’t rule out that possibility, but based on current\nevidence, I’d say the likelihood of a burglary is low.
A1_1350_TIM_600_1000	Um, Inspector Holiday? I know this has nothing to do\nwith the current case, but...
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_600_1000	You want to ask me about Harry?
A1_1350_TIM_600_2000	Yes. Do the police have any new leads on my father’s\nwhereabouts?
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_600_2000	I’m sorry, Tim, but we haven’t made any developments\non that front.
A1_1350_TIM_600_3000	Oh... Well, thanks anyway...
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_600_3000	I still don’t understand it myself.
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_600_4000	Harry was working on the R case when he went\nmissing.
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_600_5000	So it stands to reason that if you followed that thread,\nyou’d find Harry too.
A1_1350_TIM_600_4000	But the case has been closed and we still don’t have a\nsingle clue...
A1_1350_PIKACHU_600_1000	Seriously...where did Harry disappear to?
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_600_6000	Don’t be discouraged, Tim.
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_600_7000	Look at how far you’ve come in the two years since\nyou moved to the city in search of your father.
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_600_8000	You’ve become such a great detective that the mayor\nhimself recognized you with an award.
A1_1350_HOLIDAY_600_9000	You’ll find Harry—I’m sure of it. And in the meantime,\nI’ll keep offering whatever help I can.
A1_1350_TIM_600_5000	Yeah, you’re right. Thanks, Inspector Holiday.
A1_1360_GARDIE_100_1000	Growwwl...
A1_1360_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s Denis’s partner Growlithe.
A1_1360_TIM_100_1000	She sure doesn’t look happy.
A1_1360_GARDIE_100_2000	Growww...
A1_1360_PIKACHU_100_2000	Apparently she feels responsible—no wonder she’s\nso down.
A1_1360_TIM_100_2000	Maybe we should leave her alone for a while.
A1_1360_GARDIE_200_1000	Growww...
A1_1360_PIKACHU_200_1000	Cheer up, Growlithe.
A1_1370_DHPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	Lieutenant McMaster is currently interviewing\nMr. Barnes in this room.
A1_1370_TIM_100_1000	I guess it would be too much to ask for us to join\nin...right?
A1_1370_DHPOLICEMAN01_100_2000	I’m afraid we can’t allow even the great Detective Tim\nto do that. Police protocol—you understand.
A1_1375_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, I have a couple questions to ask. Got a moment?
A1_1375_LIVOLT02_100_1000	Manec!
A1_1375_PIKACHU_100_2000	Don’t wanna waste time chatting while you’re on\nduty, huh?
A1_1375_PIKACHU_100_3000	Awfully stubborn, aren’t you?
A1_1375_PIKACHU_100_4000	You’re even harder to talk to than Brad’s Manectric.
A1_1375_LIVOLT02_200_1000	Manec!
A1_1375_PIKACHU_200_1000	OK, OK, you’ve made yourself clear—I won’t bother\nyou while you’re working!
A1_1380_PIKACHU_100_1000	Where are you going? There’s no reason for us to\nhead back into the city right now.
A1_1380_TIM_100_1000	You’re right. Let’s keep investigating the mansion.
A1_1390_DHPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	Lieutenant McMaster is currently interviewing\nMr. Barnes in this room.
A1_1410_DKPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	This is the jewel storage room—the scene of the\ncrime.
A1_1420_TIM_100_1000	What’s all this? Pokémon feathers?
A1_1420_PIKACHU_100_1000	Sure looks like it. They’re scattered all over the floor,\nand the window’s open...
A1_1420_PIKACHU_100_2000	Maybe a Pokémon got in—or out—through here?
A1_1420_TIM_100_2000	Do you think it has anything to do with this case?
A1_1420_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hmm... Look at this.
A1_1420_PIKACHU_100_4000	One of these feathers is darker than the others.
A1_1420_TIM_100_3000	You’re right. The other six are a lighter shade of blue.
A1_1420_PIKACHU_100_5000	Hmm. Something about that is nagging at me...
A1_1420_PIKACHU_200_1000	Looks like Pokémon feathers.
A1_1420_PIKACHU_200_2000	Given how they’re scattered, do you think a Pokémon\nmight’ve entered or exited through the window?
A1_1425_DAPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	This room is currently being searched by the police.
A1_1430_PIKACHU_100_1000	We may be investigating a crime, but we should\nstill respect the residents’ privacy.
A1_1430_PIKACHU_100_2000	We shouldn’t go barging into rooms that have nothing\nto do with the case, Tim.
A1_1430_TIM_100_1000	True—we need to focus on the jewel storage room.
A1_1435_DKPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	The jewel storage room has been left exactly as it was\nat the time of the incident.
A1_1435_DKPOLICEMAN01_100_2000	Inspector Holiday’s already filled me in. Please, go\nright ahead.
A1_1435_TIM_100_1000	Thank you.
A1_1450_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hmm...
A1_1450_TIM_100_1000	What is it, Pikachu?
A1_1450_PIKACHU_100_2000	I checked out the door, but there are no signs of\nforced entry.
A1_1450_TIM_100_2000	Then we can be fairly certain that the thief used a key\nto get in.
A1_1450_PIKACHU_100_3000	According to Denis, this room’s where the Aurora\nDrop used to be.
A1_1450_PIKACHU_100_4000	Let’s take a closer look.
A1_1460_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, where are you going?
A1_1460_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’re not done investigating and deducing!
A1_1470_PIKACHU_300_1000	You sure you’ve checked everywhere?
A1_1470_TIM_400_1000	This area looks more disturbed than the rest.
A1_1470_TIM_400_2000	Let’s start investigating. We might find a clue.
A1_1470_PIKACHU_400_1000	All right! Don’t let any details slip past you, Tim!
A1_1480_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s see... Where should we look first...
A1_1480_PIKACHU_200_1000	Wanna look around again?
A1_1490_PIKACHU_5000_1000	You sure you’ve checked everywhere?
A1_1500_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Tim.
A1_1500_PIKACHU_100_2000	Quit looking at my tail and start investigating\nanything that looks suspicious.
A1_1510_PIKACHU_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>There’s some cotton on the ground.</color> It looks really\nfluffy and soft.
A1_1510_TIM_100_1000	What’s a bunch of cotton doing in here?
A1_1530_TIM_100_1000	That looks like part of the jewel case.
A1_1530_PIKACHU_100_1000	Based on the shape, do you think <color=#F39800FF>the top half of the</color>\n<color=#F39800FF>case was cut off</color>?
A1_1530_TIM_100_2000	Yeah, it looks that way—<color=#F39800FF>it’s a really clean cut</color>.
A1_1530_PIKACHU_100_2000	Slicing it must’ve taken one seriously sharp blade.\nI doubt a human could pull that off.
A1_1540_TIM_100_1000	The base of the jewel case is firmly fixed to the floor.
A1_1540_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. Moving the base doesn’t even look possible.
A1_1550_TIM_100_1000	Here’s a blue feather. Do you think the Pokémon it\nbelonged to was in this room?
A1_1550_PIKACHU_100_1000	Maybe it’s from a Pokémon that lives in the mansion.\nLet’s look into that later.
A1_1560_TIM_100_1000	This is the only case that’s damaged.
A1_1560_PIKACHU_100_1000	Must be where they kept the Aurora Drop.
A1_1560_TIM_100_2000	The edge looks like it was sliced clean with a blade.
A1_1560_PIKACHU_100_2000	What kinda blade could slice this cleanly through\nsuch a sturdy jewel case?
A1_1570_TIM_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>The jewel case is still locked.</color>
A1_1570_PIKACHU_100_1000	Like Denis said, the jewel in this case was stored\nunder lock and key.
A1_1570_PIKACHU_100_2000	And the key to the case is a different key than the\none to the jewel storage room door.
A1_1570_TIM_100_2000	I wonder who has the key, then.
A1_1590_PIKACHU_100_1000	I don’t see anything else worth investigating.
A1_1591_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve covered everything I was wondering about.
A1_1591_PIKACHU_100_2000	Any other spots you wanna check?
A1_1595_TIM_100_1000	After investigating the scene, we now know how the\ncrime was carried out.
A1_1595_PIKACHU_100_1000	We can be certain that the culprit sliced open the\ncase and took the jewel from inside.
A1_1595_PIKACHU_100_2000	But there’s just one thing that’s strange.
A1_1595_TIM_100_2000	Oh yeah?
A1_1595_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yeah. Think, Tim—what’s strange about the way the\ncrime was committed?
A1_1595_SEL_0_1000	The jewel storage room door was locked
A1_1595_SEL_0_2000	The jewel was stored in this room
A1_1595_SEL_0_3000	The glass was cut, but the door wasn’t
A1_1595_PIKACHU_300_1000	There’s nothing strange about the door being locked.
A1_1595_PIKACHU_300_2000	This isn’t a museum, you know.
A1_1595_PIKACHU_400_1000	Sure, the jewel was stored in this room, but there’s\nnothing strange about that.
A1_1595_PIKACHU_400_2000	It’s called the jewel storage room, after all.
A1_1595_PIKACHU_400_3000	Try to think of something else.
A1_1595_TIM_500_1000	The door to the storage room was opened with a key.
A1_1595_TIM_500_2000	But the jewel case was still locked when it was sliced\napart.
A1_1595_PIKACHU_500_1000	That’s right. So that means the thief only had one of\nthe keys—the one to the storage room.
A1_1595_PIKACHU_500_2000	They didn’t have the key to the jewel case.
A1_1595_TIM_500_3000	According to Mr. Denis, only he and Barnes can\naccess the jewel storage room.
A1_1595_TIM_500_4000	I understand why the police suspect Barnes, but I’m\nnot so sure...
A1_1595_PIKACHU_500_3000	Obviously it’d be best if we could talk to Barnes\nourselves, but he’s still being questioned...
A1_1595_TIM_500_5000	We need to ask Mr. Denis about the lock on the\njewel case.
A1_1595_PIKACHU_500_4000	Right. After we wrap up here, let’s go ask him.
A1_1600_DENIS_100_1000	How’s the investigation going, Tim?
A1_1600_TIM_100_1000	Oh—Mr. Denis!
A1_1600_DENIS_100_2000	Sorry, I couldn’t stand just waiting around. Have you\ndiscovered anything?
A1_1600_TIM_100_2000	It does appear that the culprit used the storage room\nkey to gain entry.
A1_1600_TIM_100_3000	We believe they then cut open the jewel case and\ntook the Aurora Drop.
A1_1600_DENIS_100_3000	Is that so... I suppose that doesn’t help Barnes much,\nsince he has access to the key.
A1_1600_TIM_100_4000	I have a question for you, Mr. Denis.
A1_1600_TIM_100_5000	Who has the key to the jewel case?
A1_1600_DENIS_100_4000	<color=#F39800FF>I have it right here. I always carry the key to the jewel\ncase on my person.</color>
A1_1600_DENIS_100_5000	<color=#F39800FF>I’ve known Barnes a very long time, but I still won’t\ngive him this key.</color>
A1_1600_DENIS_100_6000	The security of the jewel case is my personal\nresponsibility.
A1_1600_PIKACHU_100_1000	Got it. So both Barnes and Denis can access the key\nto the jewel storage room...
A1_1600_TIM_100_6000	But only Mr. Denis has access to the key to the\njewel case itself.
A1_1600_TIM_100_7000	That’s valuable information, Mr. Denis! Thank you!
A1_1600_DENIS_100_7000	Really? I thought I might be getting in the way, but\nI’m glad to hear I could help!
A1_1600_DENIS_100_8000	The Aurora Drop is meant to become a symbol of\nrevival for Ryme City.
A1_1600_DENIS_100_9000	Anyway, I’m counting on you, Tim!
A1_1600_TIM_100_8000	“A symbol of revival”?
A1_1600_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s ask Denis about that later.
A1_1610_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Tim! There’s something on the floor by the\nwindow!
A1_1610_PIKACHU_100_2000	Should we check it out?
A1_1620_PIKACHU_100_1000	Where are you going, Tim?
A1_1620_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s check out that window first.
A1_1720_NONAMETURNER_100_1000	...Wait, you ARE the detective, right? That’s what\nMr. Denis said, at least.
A1_1720_TURNER_100_2000	The name’s—wait, that’s not proper enough. Sorry.\nMy name is Larry Turner, and I’m a member of the\nhouse staff.
A1_1720_PIKACHU_100_1000	House staff, huh? Seems in over his head.
A1_1720_TURNER_100_3000	If you need anything, just lemme know... I mean,\nplease inform me if—
A1_1720_TIM_100_1000	You really don’t have to be so formal with us.
A1_1720_TURNER_100_4000	Th-thanks. That’s a huge relief!
A1_1720_TURNER_100_5000	I got this job a while ago, but I’m still not used to\ntalking all fancy.
A1_1720_TIM_100_2000	Uh-oh. Is that a problem?
A1_1720_TURNER_100_6000	Well, it’s a good thing for me that Barnes deals with\nall the important guests.
A1_1720_TURNER_100_7000	My main duties are taking care of the Pokémon,\nmanaging the house, and groundskeeping.
A1_1720_TURNER_100_8000	And I can handle all that, no problem!
A1_1720_PIKACHU_100_2000	I dunno... This guy isn’t exactly filling me with\nconfidence in his ability to do his job.
A1_1720_TURNER_100_9000	Anyway, uh...you wanted to ask about what\nhappened, right?
A1_1720_TURNER_100_10000	I mean, I already told the police everything I know...
A1_1720_TIM_100_3000	I’m really sorry for taking up more of your time.
A1_1720_TURNER_100_11000	Oh sorry, that’s not what I meant! I’m not complaining\nor anything!
A1_1720_TURNER_100_12000	It’s just that I don’t remember what happened\nvery well.
A1_1720_TURNER_100_13000	Something attacked me out of nowhere, and I\nblacked out...
A1_1720_PIKACHU_100_3000	“Something” attacked him? So, not the thief, then?
A1_1720_TIM_100_4000	Can you please tell us more about that, Mr. Turner?
A1_1720_TURNER_100_14000	Sure, no problem!
A1_1720_TIM_200_1000	Could we please talk to you again, Mr. Turner?
A1_1720_TURNER_200_1000	Yeah, of course! Ask me anything!
A1_1720_SEL_0_1000	About the crime that took place...
A1_1720_SEL_0_2000	About the culprit...
A1_1720_SEL_0_3000	About the Aurora Drop...
A1_1720_SEL_0_4000	About Growlithe’s food...
A1_1720_TURNER_300_1000	Right. So, where to start...
A1_1720_TURNER_300_2000	I was just doing my job like normal today.
A1_1720_TURNER_300_3000	I’d made food for the Pokémon, did some cleaning\naround the mansion—that sort of thing.
A1_1720_TURNER_300_4000	I think I was tidying the garden when it happened.
A1_1720_TURNER_300_5000	<color=#F39800FF>I saw Ducklett fly out of a second-story window.</color>
A1_1720_TURNER_300_6000	As I recall, I wondered where she was going.
A1_1720_TURNER_300_7000	I mean, usually Ducklett just walks out the front door.
A1_1720_TURNER_300_8000	It seemed weird to me, so I went upstairs to see what\nwas going on.
A1_1720_TURNER_300_9000	That’s when I saw that the door to the jewel storage\nroom was wide open!
A1_1720_TURNER_300_10000	As if that wasn’t shocking enough, the moment I went\nto look inside I suddenly got punched by a Pokémon!
A1_1720_TURNER_300_11000	The next thing I knew, I was lying on a sofa and\nsomeone was treating my wounds.
A1_1720_TIM_300_1000	A Pokémon punched you?!
A1_1720_TURNER_300_12000	Yeah. I feel like I glimpsed a small, red figure for just\na moment.
A1_1720_TURNER_300_13000	Based on the size, it couldn’t have been human, so\nI’m guessing it was a Pokémon.
A1_1720_TIM_300_2000	<color=#F39800FF>A red Pokémon?</color> Do you know what kind it was?
A1_1720_TURNER_300_14000	I’m really not sure. It all happened so fast...
A1_1720_TIM_300_3000	I see. I’m so sorry that happened to you.
A1_1720_TIM_300_4000	But I’m glad you weren’t seriously hurt.
A1_1720_TURNER_300_15000	Hahaha! That’s what the doctor said too.
A1_1720_PIKACHU_300_1000	No Pokémon would wanna steal the Aurora Drop.
A1_1720_PIKACHU_300_2000	It’s possible that the culprit ordered their partner\nPokémon to swipe the jewel and punch out Turner.
A1_1720_PIKACHU_300_3000	So, Tim—now that you’ve heard Turner’s story, what\ndo you think?
A1_1720_TIM_300_5000	<color=#F39800FF>We need to find the Ducklett that flew out the\nwindow—and that red Pokémon too.</color>
A1_1720_PIKACHU_300_4000	Yep, you got it.
A1_1720_TIM_400_1000	Did you see anything else when the Pokémon\nattacked you?
A1_1720_TIM_400_2000	The thief who brought the Pokémon along was\nprobably nearby.
A1_1720_TURNER_400_1000	Unfortunately, that’s all I saw.
A1_1720_TIM_400_3000	I see...
A1_1720_TIM_400_4000	Can you think of any other details that might give us\na clue about the culprit?
A1_1720_TURNER_400_2000	Hmm... Nothing in particular’s coming to mind.
A1_1720_TURNER_400_3000	I mean, Mr. Denis is such a nice person.
A1_1720_TURNER_400_4000	I’ve never heard of anyone holding a grudge\nagainst him.
A1_1720_TURNER_400_5000	And I was really surprised to hear that Barnes is\na suspect.
A1_1720_TIM_400_5000	You don’t think Barnes is responsible?
A1_1720_TURNER_400_6000	I guess the police must have some reason to\nsuspect him...
A1_1720_TURNER_400_7000	But honestly, I just can’t believe it.
A1_1720_TURNER_400_8000	Barnes is still showin’ me the ropes around here.\nHe’s a great coworker with tons of experience.
A1_1720_TURNER_400_9000	I mean, if you’d known Barnes before all this, you\ncould never even imagine him being a thief.
A1_1720_TIM_500_1000	Do you know anything about the stolen jewel?
A1_1720_TURNER_500_1000	The Aurora Drop? I’ve never even seen the thing.
A1_1720_TURNER_500_2000	It’s been shut up in that storage room ever since it\nwas brought to the house.
A1_1720_TURNER_500_3000	Of course, I know it’s valuable and all.
A1_1720_TURNER_500_4000	I assume that’s what’s been causing all the arguments\nbetween Mr. and Mrs. Denis lately.
A1_1720_TIM_500_2000	What sort of arguments?
A1_1720_TURNER_500_5000	In case you haven’t heard, Mr. Denis says he’s gonna\ndonate the Aurora Drop.
A1_1720_TURNER_500_6000	Seems like Mrs. Denis is against that plan.
A1_1720_TURNER_500_7000	They’ve been fighting about it almost nightly.
A1_1720_TIM_500_3000	Every night? It must really be a point of contention.
A1_1720_TURNER_500_8000	I guess Mrs. Denis just doesn’t want to give up such a\nvaluable jewel.
A1_1720_PIKACHU_500_1000	Hmm. So the Aurora Drop’s been driving a wedge\nbetween husband and wife, eh?
A1_1720_TURNER_600_1000	Mr. Denis is really picky about the ingredients\nI can use for Growlithe’s food.
A1_1720_TURNER_600_2000	<color=#F39800FF>He tells me what to put in it, and I make the food to\nhis exact specifications.</color>
A1_1720_TIM_600_1000	Sounds like Mr. Denis really cares about\nGrowlithe’s health.
A1_1720_TURNER_600_3000	Yes, he truly cares about Pokémon. A good egg,\nthat one.
A1_1720_PIKACHU_600_1000	Denis seems like quite the guy.
A1_1720_PIKACHU_600_2000	What’s healthy and what’s tasty don’t always match\nup, though...
A1_1740_TIM_100_1000	We’re detectives. Mr. Denis asked us to investigate\nthe incident that occurred here.
A1_1740_NONAMECLAUDIA_100_1000	Detectives? Oh, I suppose my husband did say\nsomething about that.
A1_1740_TIM_100_2000	Your husband? That must mean you’re...
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_100_2000	Claudia Denis. Sanjeev’s wife.
A1_1740_TIM_100_3000	I’m sorry to bother you, but do you mind if we ask you\nsome questions?
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_100_3000	I do mind, actually.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_100_4000	I’m going to have to ask you to leave. The case has\nalready been solved.
A1_1740_TIM_100_4000	What do you mean?
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_100_5000	The police said that Barnes is behind all this.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_100_6000	So the matter’s settled.
A1_1740_TIM_100_5000	We’ve heard that he’s under suspicion, yes.
A1_1740_TIM_100_6000	But we can’t be certain it was Barnes who committed\nthe crime.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_100_7000	You sound just like my husband.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_100_8000	But nothing you say will change the fact that Barnes is\nthe culprit.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_100_9000	<color=#F39800FF>Barnes’s partner Ducklett was up to no good. I saw it\nwith my own eyes!</color>
A1_1740_TIM_100_7000	Did you witness the crime?!
A1_1740_PIKACHU_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>Barnes’s partner Ducklett was involved in the crime?</color>
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_100_10000	You look as though you don’t believe me.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_200_1000	Did you still want something?
A1_1740_TIM_200_1000	Yes, I’m sorry. We really appreciate your help.
A1_1740_SEL_0_1000	About what you witnessed...
A1_1740_SEL_0_2000	About Barnes...
A1_1740_SEL_0_3000	About Ducklett...
A1_1740_SEL_0_4000	About the Aurora Drop...
A1_1740_SEL_0_5000	About Growlithe’s food...
A1_1740_TIM_300_1000	Is it true that you witnessed the crime?
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_300_1000	Well, I didn’t exactly see it clearly...
A1_1740_PIKACHU_300_1000	Huh?
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_300_2000	But I did witness some irrefutable proof!
A1_1740_TIM_300_2000	What exactly did you see?
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_300_3000	At the time of the incident, I was enjoying a cup of\ntea in my room on the second floor.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_300_4000	Just then, I noticed a bird Pokémon flying outside\nthe window.
A1_1740_TIM_300_3000	A bird Pokémon?
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_300_5000	<color=#F39800FF>Yes. I clearly saw a blue bird Pokémon. It had to have\nbeen Ducklett.</color>
A1_1740_PIKACHU_300_2000	We did find blue feathers near the window and in the\nstorage room.
A1_1740_PIKACHU_300_3000	So those were Ducklett’s?
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_300_6000	In hindsight, she was obviously stealing the jewel.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_300_7000	I also heard a faint sound just before that—like\nsomething metallic.
A1_1740_TIM_300_4000	A metallic sound? Do you know what could have\nmade that noise?
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_300_8000	No, I don’t. But the storage room was ransacked,\nwasn’t it?
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_300_9000	I suppose she must have broken something in the act.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_300_10000	And I’ve heard it confirmed that Ducklett’s feathers\nwere found in the room.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_300_11000	Isn’t that proof enough that Barnes is the culprit?
A1_1740_PIKACHU_300_4000	Hmm. She’s pretty darn convinced of her own theory.
A1_1740_PIKACHU_300_5000	But all it’s based on is a metallic sound and the sight\nof a flying blue bird Pokémon—pretty flimsy, if you\nask me!
A1_1740_TIM_300_5000	Yeah.
A1_1740_TIM_300_6000	I’m sorry, Mrs. Denis, but that information alone isn’t\nenough to definitively prove Barnes is the culprit.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_300_12000	Then hurry up and find whoever is—and get that\njewel back!
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_300_13000	Isn’t that what my husband hired you for?
A1_1740_PIKACHU_300_6000	*sigh* I get that she’s upset, but she doesn’t have to\ntake it out on us...
A1_1740_TIM_400_1000	Mr. Denis seems confident that Barnes is innocent.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_400_1000	Oh yes, I’m sure he is. He’s always been too trusting.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_400_2000	Especially when it comes to Barnes.
A1_1740_TIM_400_2000	Those two really trust each other that much?
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_400_3000	I’m told Barnes has worked here for a very long time.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_400_4000	Much longer, in fact, than I’ve known Sanjeev.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_400_5000	I suppose that’s why Barnes is always taking my\nhusband’s side.
A1_1740_TIM_400_3000	What do you mean by that?
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_400_6000	Whenever my husband and I have a disagreement,\nBarnes inevitably sides with Sanjeev.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_400_7000	Even though I’m sure he believes he’s being impartial.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_400_8000	That lack of self-awareness is yet another one of his\nmany flaws.
A1_1740_PIKACHU_400_1000	I get the feeling Claudia’s not a huge fan of Barnes.
A1_1740_PIKACHU_400_2000	Do you think that’s why she’s so sure he’s the thief?
A1_1740_TIM_500_1000	Could you tell me more about Ducklett?
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_500_1000	<color=#F39800FF>Ducklett is Barnes’s partner.</color>
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_500_2000	<color=#F39800FF>She dotes on him tirelessly and is always by his side.</color>
A1_1740_TIM_500_2000	You mentioned earlier that she might be involved in\nthe crime somehow.
A1_1740_TIM_500_3000	Would Ducklett be capable of such a thing?
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_500_3000	Yes. She even helps Barnes out with his shopping.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_500_4000	She’d certainly be capable of making off with a jewel.
A1_1740_PIKACHU_500_1000	Well, whether or not Ducklett stole the jewel...
A1_1740_PIKACHU_500_2000	the one thing that seems certain is that she really\nloves Barnes.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_600_1000	The Aurora Drop is an incredibly valuable jewel.
A1_1740_TIM_600_1000	Mr. Denis told me the same thing.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_600_2000	But do you really understand? Can you even\ncomprehend just how valuable it is?
A1_1740_TIM_600_2000	Huh?
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_600_3000	I knew it. Just look at those blank expressions.
A1_1740_PIKACHU_600_1000	Hey, my face always looks like this.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_600_4000	As it is, I’m not even sure my husband understands the\ntrue value of that jewel.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_600_5000	After getting his hands on something so precious, why\nwould he want to donate it to Ryme City?!
A1_1740_TIM_600_3000	So you’re against donating the Aurora Drop?
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_600_6000	Of course I am! Treasures like that aren’t meant to be\nparaded about for the general public!
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_600_7000	They should be preserved for quiet observation by\na select few.
A1_1740_PIKACHU_600_2000	Hmph. Hard to imagine her “quietly” doing anything...
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_700_1000	I don’t know anything about Growlithe’s food.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_700_2000	I would suggest you ask Turner about that.
A1_1740_TIM_700_1000	Did you happen to see Growlithe eating her\nfood today?
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_700_3000	No, I didn’t. I’m not in the habit of watching her eat.
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_700_4000	<color=#F39800FF>The Pokémon of the house eat in a separate room\nfrom us humans.</color>
A1_1740_CLAUDIA_700_5000	If they ate in the same room as us, their fur, feathers,\nor what have you could get in our food, so they eat\nin a different room—at my request, of course.
A1_1740_PIKACHU_700_1000	A policy like that’s not gonna make you very popular\nwith Pokémon, lady.
A1_1760_PIXY_100_1000	Fab!
A1_1760_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, it’s Clefable—Mrs. Denis’s partner, apparently.
A1_1760_PIKACHU_100_2000	Can I ask you a few questions?
A1_1760_PIXY_100_2000	Faaae!
A1_1760_PIKACHU_100_3000	Whoa, what gives? No need to be so rude.
A1_1760_TIM_100_1000	What’s wrong?
A1_1760_PIKACHU_100_4000	Seems like she’s real suspicious of us.
A1_1760_PIKACHU_100_5000	Maybe she’s feeling sensitive after the incident here.
A1_1760_PIXY_200_1000	Faaae!
A1_1760_PIKACHU_200_1000	She still looks awfully suspicious of us. Let’s try\nagain later.
A1_1770_DHPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	Now then, Mr. Barnes, we’ll thank you not to leave\nthe mansion until further notice.
A1_1770_SECRETBURNS_100_1000	Understood.
A1_1770_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, it sounds like the police finished questioning\nBarnes. Let’s go talk to him!
A1_1770_TIM_100_1000	Yeah!
A1_1790_NONAMEBURNS_100_1000	*sigh* How did it come to this? Why are the police\nso suspicious of me?
A1_1790_TIM_100_1000	Excuse me, are you Mr. Barnes?
A1_1790_NONAMEBURNS_100_2000	Hm? Who might you be?
A1_1790_TIM_100_2000	I’m Detective Tim Goodman. Mr. Denis has hired me\nto investigate the crime that occurred here.
A1_1790_NONAMEBURNS_100_3000	Is that so...?
A1_1790_BURNS_100_4000	Ah, my apologies. I am Brandon Barnes.
A1_1790_BURNS_100_5000	I work here at the Denis residence as a butler.
A1_1790_TIM_100_3000	Do you mind if we ask you some questions,\nMr. Barnes?
A1_1790_TIM_100_4000	I realize you must be tired since you were just\nquestioned by the police...
A1_1790_BURNS_100_6000	Please don’t worry about that.
A1_1790_BURNS_100_7000	If you’ve been hired by Mr. Denis, then it is my duty\nto give you my full cooperation.
A1_1790_TIM_100_5000	Thank you.
A1_1790_BURNS_100_8000	What would you like me to speak about first?
A1_1790_BURNS_200_1000	I’d be happy to tell you anything I know.
A1_1790_SEL_0_1000	At the time of the incident...
A1_1790_SEL_0_2000	About the culprit...
A1_1790_SEL_0_3000	About Ducklett...
A1_1790_SEL_0_4000	About the Aurora Drop...
A1_1790_SEL_0_5000	About Growlithe’s food...
A1_1790_BURNS_300_1000	I was away when the incident occurred.
A1_1790_BURNS_300_2000	It wasn’t until after I’d finished my errand and entered\nthe house that I realized something was amiss.
A1_1790_BURNS_300_3000	I heard Turner cry out from the second floor.
A1_1790_BURNS_300_4000	When I rushed upstairs, I found him collapsed on the\nfloor in front of the jewel storage room.
A1_1790_PIKACHU_300_1000	So that means Barnes was the first witness to arrive\nat the scene of the crime.
A1_1790_TIM_300_1000	Did you see the thief or their partner Pokémon?
A1_1790_BURNS_300_5000	No, nothing like that...
A1_1790_PIKACHU_300_2000	Wait... If Barnes ran up the stairs, you’d think he\nwould’ve run straight into the thief.
A1_1790_PIKACHU_300_3000	If he didn’t see anyone, could they have escaped\nfrom the second floor?
A1_1790_TIM_300_2000	Did you check the storage room?
A1_1790_BURNS_300_6000	Yes. The door was already open—and when I looked\ninside, I saw that the Aurora Drop was gone.
A1_1790_BURNS_300_7000	I then contacted Mr. Denis and the police right away.
A1_1790_TIM_300_3000	Is there anyone who can corroborate your\nwhereabouts at the time?
A1_1790_BURNS_300_8000	Unfortunately not...
A1_1790_BURNS_300_9000	It was only afterward that Mrs. Denis came out of her\nroom to see what the commotion was about.
A1_1790_BURNS_300_10000	And the only others in the house at the time were\nGrowlithe and Clefable...
A1_1790_BURNS_300_11000	Naturally, no one can take witness statements from\nPokémon, so I’m afraid I have no alibi.
A1_1790_PIKACHU_300_4000	That’s where we come in... The Pokémon that live in\nthis mansion might know something.
A1_1790_TIM_400_1000	Mr. Barnes, do you have any idea who the thief\nmight be?
A1_1790_BURNS_400_1000	Not a clue, I’m afraid.
A1_1790_BURNS_400_2000	But I do know that <color=#F39800FF>Mr. Denis and I are the only ones\nwho can freely use the key to the jewel storage room</color>.
A1_1790_BURNS_400_3000	Growlithe guards that key with constant vigilance.
A1_1790_BURNS_400_4000	So, I imagine it would be very difficult for anyone else\nto take it from her.
A1_1790_BURNS_400_5000	I suppose it’s no great wonder that the police suspect\nme, given the circumstances.
A1_1790_BURNS_400_6000	But I would never do something so senseless.
A1_1790_PIKACHU_400_1000	At least this confirms that only those two have access\nto the key.
A1_1790_BURNS_500_1000	<color=#F39800FF>Ducklett is my dear partner Pokémon.</color>
A1_1790_BURNS_500_2000	Just look at this photo!
A1_1790_TIM_500_1000	That’s Ducklett with you there?
A1_1790_BURNS_500_3000	Yes! Isn’t she adorable? Just look at her feathers—\nsimply beautiful!
A1_1790_BURNS_500_4000	But that’s not all.
A1_1790_BURNS_500_5000	She’s also incredibly clever and even helps me out\nwith my work!
A1_1790_BURNS_500_6000	Oh... Ahem. Excuse me.
A1_1790_BURNS_500_7000	I’m terribly sorry. I tend to get a bit carried away\nwhen I speak about Ducklett.
A1_1790_TIM_500_2000	It’s really no problem.
A1_1790_TIM_500_3000	You mentioned that she helps you with your work.\nWhat exactly does she do?
A1_1790_BURNS_500_8000	Let’s see...
A1_1790_BURNS_500_9000	<color=#F39800FF>She runs errands for me, such as buying coffee beans\nfrom a local café.</color>
A1_1790_PIKACHU_500_1000	Ohhh, she buys coffee beans. Nice.
A1_1790_BURNS_500_10000	There’s a place nearby called the Hi-Hat Café.\nPerhaps you’ve heard of it?
A1_1790_BURNS_500_11000	She regularly goes shopping there by herself.
A1_1790_PIKACHU_500_2000	If that’s their go-to café, then it’s gotta be for the\nHi-Hat Blend.
A1_1790_PIKACHU_500_3000	Guess I shouldn’t be surprised that Ryme City’s elites\nhave such refined taste.
A1_1790_BURNS_500_12000	I asked her to go to the café today, in fact, but she\nhasn’t yet returned.
A1_1790_BURNS_500_13000	Could she have wandered off somewhere...?
A1_1790_TIM_500_4000	Do you have any idea where Ducklett might be?
A1_1790_BURNS_500_14000	Unfortunately, no...
A1_1790_TIM_500_5000	The feathers found at the scene of the crime are\nDucklett’s, right?
A1_1790_BURNS_500_15000	Yes, no question about it.
A1_1790_BURNS_500_16000	But I haven’t the faintest idea why Ducklett’s feathers\nwould be there.
A1_1790_BURNS_500_17000	Just the thought of her getting caught up in the crime\nsomehow... I’m so worried I can hardly think straight.
A1_1790_BURNS_600_1000	Out of all the jewels in Mr. Denis’s collection, he\nconsiders the Aurora Drop to be his most precious.
A1_1790_BURNS_600_2000	He worked tirelessly to acquire it in the first place.
A1_1790_BURNS_600_3000	You might even say the Aurora Drop is the physical\nmanifestation—the crystallization!—of Mr. Denis’s\ncareer as a jeweler.
A1_1790_BURNS_600_4000	I wish nothing but swift retribution on the thief who\nstole it from him.
A1_1790_PIKACHU_600_1000	For someone who speaks so formally, Barnes is a\npretty passionate guy, isn’t he?
A1_1790_BURNS_600_5000	Please, Tim—find the Aurora Drop. I beg you.
A1_1790_TIM_600_1000	Don’t worry, sir. We’re on the case.
A1_1790_BURNS_700_1000	<color=#F39800FF>I know exactly what kinds of food Growlithe prefers.</color>
A1_1790_BURNS_700_2000	She’s particularly fond of sweets.
A1_1790_BURNS_700_3000	When I was in charge of her meals, I made a point of\npreparing sweet desserts for her.
A1_1790_PIKACHU_700_1000	You’re a good guy, Barnes.
A1_1790_PIKACHU_700_2000	You could learn a thing or two from this guy, Tim.\nGimme more sweets!
A1_1790_BURNS_700_4000	Is Pikachu all right? He seems to be acting...strangely.
A1_1790_TIM_700_1000	Don’t worry—this is normal for him.
A1_1800_PIKACHU_100_1000	Based on Barnes’s testimony, I’m really not surprised\nthe police suspect him.
A1_1800_TIM_100_1000	Yeah. If only there was another witness, at least!
A1_1800_PIKACHU_100_2000	About that—aren’t you forgetting something, Tim?
A1_1800_TIM_100_2000	Huh?
A1_1800_PIKACHU_100_3000	Barnes told us that Growlithe and Clefable were in\nthe mansion at the time of the incident, remember?
A1_1800_TIM_100_3000	Oh, right! Maybe the Pokémon saw something!
A1_1800_PIKACHU_100_4000	Exactly! You can leave the rest to me!
A1_1800_PIKACHU_100_5000	Let’s go question them, Tim!
A1_1810_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Growlithe. Sorry to bug you when you’re already\nfeeling down, but would it be all right if we asked you\nsome questions?
A1_1810_GARDIE_100_1000	Growwwl?
A1_1810_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’re here to catch the thief.
A1_1810_PIKACHU_100_3000	And we need your help to do that.
A1_1810_GARDIE_100_2000	Gowww...
A1_1810_PIKACHU_100_4000	You’re willing to talk to us if it’ll help Sanjee? Thanks.
A1_1810_TIM_100_1000	Sanjee?
A1_1810_PIKACHU_100_5000	Growlithe’s nickname for Denis, near as I can tell.
A1_1810_TIM_100_2000	Oh, right. His full name is Sanjeev Denis, so I guess\n“Sanjee” makes sense.
A1_1810_PIKACHU_100_6000	Anyway, Growlithe, can we start with the questions?
A1_1810_GARDIE_200_1000	Goww.
A1_1810_PIKACHU_200_1000	She says we can ask away.
A1_1810_SEL_0_1000	About you, Growlithe...
A1_1810_SEL_0_2000	At the time of the incident...
A1_1810_SEL_0_3000	About Barnes...
A1_1810_SEL_0_4000	About your special skills...
A1_1810_GARDIE_300_1000	Growl.
A1_1810_PIKACHU_300_1000	Gotcha. As Denis’s partner, it’s your job to guard\nthe mansion.
A1_1810_PIKACHU_300_2000	And we already know the key to the jewel storage\nroom was around your neck.
A1_1810_GARDIE_300_2000	Gowww!
A1_1810_PIKACHU_300_3000	It’s important to Denis, so guarding it is important\nto you. Makes sense.
A1_1810_GARDIE_300_3000	Gow gow.
A1_1810_PIKACHU_300_4000	She says she’d never let anyone other than Denis or\nBarnes even touch the key.
A1_1810_GARDIE_300_4000	Gowww...
A1_1810_PIKACHU_300_5000	So that’s why you feel extra responsible for what\nhappened, huh?
A1_1810_TIM_300_1000	She’s really got a strong sense of responsibility.
A1_1810_PIKACHU_300_6000	Don’t worry. The two of us are gonna crack this case!
A1_1810_PIKACHU_400_1000	Do you remember anything about the time of the\nincident?
A1_1810_GARDIE_400_1000	Gow...
A1_1810_PIKACHU_400_2000	You don’t know ’cause you were napping?
A1_1810_GARDIE_400_2000	Gowww...
A1_1810_PIKACHU_400_3000	What? Your breakfast was so tasty that you ate too\nmuch and it made you sleepy?
A1_1810_PIKACHU_400_4000	Heh, been there. Believe me.
A1_1810_TIM_400_1000	What are you even talking about?
A1_1810_GARDIE_400_3000	Gow... Gowww...
A1_1810_PIKACHU_400_5000	You woke up when Barnes got home? That would’ve\nbeen right before all the commotion happened.
A1_1810_PIKACHU_400_6000	And when you woke up, your precious key was gone?
A1_1810_GARDIE_400_4000	Growl...
A1_1810_PIKACHU_400_7000	Yeah, I can tell you’re upset...
A1_1810_GARDIE_400_5000	Gow!
A1_1810_PIKACHU_400_8000	You’ll do whatever it takes to help us catch the thief?
A1_1810_PIKACHU_400_9000	Thanks!
A1_1810_PIKACHU_400_10000	We’ll come ask for an assist if anything comes up.
A1_1810_GARDIE_500_1000	Gow gowww!
A1_1810_PIKACHU_500_1000	She says Barnes is a kind and well-mannered person.
A1_1810_PIKACHU_500_2000	He and Denis are close, and she’s never seen them\nfighting or arguing.
A1_1810_TIM_500_1000	Mr. Denis really does seem to trust Barnes, after all.
A1_1810_GARDIE_500_2000	Gow gow!
A1_1810_PIKACHU_500_3000	And Growlithe likes Barnes too.
A1_1810_TIM_500_2000	Judging from what Growlithe says, it’s hard to think of\nBarnes as a likely culprit.
A1_1810_PIKACHU_600_1000	Do you have any special skills that might help us\ncatch the thief?
A1_1810_GARDIE_600_1000	Gow!
A1_1810_PIKACHU_600_2000	She says <color=#F39800FF>she’s got a very keen nose</color>!
A1_1810_TIM_600_1000	That could come in handy—maybe she can track\nsomething by following its scent?
A1_1810_PIKACHU_600_3000	Yeah, that might work.
A1_1815_TIM_100_1000	There wasn’t anything in Growlithe’s testimony that\ncould help us prove Barnes’s innocence.
A1_1815_PIKACHU_100_1000	Only one left to ask is Clefable.
A1_1815_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’ll do what I can to get Clefable talking to us.
A1_1815_TIM_100_2000	Thanks, Pikachu.
A1_1820_PIXY_100_1000	Faeee!
A1_1820_PIKACHU_100_1000	What? You think we’re thieves returning to the scene\nof the crime?!
A1_1820_PIKACHU_100_2000	You got it all wrong—we’re not here to steal anything!
A1_1820_PIKACHU_100_3000	We’re actually great detectives looking to catch the\nthief! Please, can you answer some questions?
A1_1820_PIXY_100_2000	Fae?
A1_1820_PIKACHU_100_4000	Yes, really. C’mon, you can trust us!
A1_1820_PIXY_100_3000	Fae fae?
A1_1820_PIKACHU_100_5000	Yeah. Help us out, and I’m sure Claudia’s bad mood\nwill clear up too.
A1_1820_PIXY_100_4000	Fae fae...
A1_1820_PIKACHU_100_6000	So you’re willing to talk to us? Thanks.
A1_1820_TIM_100_1000	Guess Clefable was worried we’d do something bad\nto Mrs. Denis.
A1_1820_PIKACHU_200_1000	Clefable, can we ask you some questions?
A1_1820_PIXY_200_1000	Fae!
A1_1820_SEL_0_1000	About you, Clefable...
A1_1820_SEL_0_2000	At the time of the incident...
A1_1820_SEL_0_3000	About Barnes...
A1_1820_SEL_0_4000	About your special skills...
A1_1820_PIKACHU_300_1000	Do you have a job here at the mansion?
A1_1820_PIXY_300_1000	Fae.
A1_1820_PIKACHU_300_2000	Ah. No “job,” per se, unless you count spending time\nwith Claudia?
A1_1820_PIKACHU_300_3000	Isn’t it tough hanging out with someone so...prickly?
A1_1820_PIXY_300_2000	Fae!
A1_1820_PIKACHU_300_4000	Claudia’s not a bad person, you say?
A1_1820_PIKACHU_300_5000	Sorry, didn’t mean to be insulting.
A1_1820_PIXY_300_3000	Fae fae, faaae.
A1_1820_PIKACHU_300_6000	Uh-huh. So Claudia’s always arguing with someone\nor other.
A1_1820_PIKACHU_300_7000	But when it’s just you and her together, she starts to\nregret the whole thing?
A1_1820_PIKACHU_300_8000	Ahhh, I get it now. Your job is to cheer her up when\nshe gets into arguments.
A1_1820_PIKACHU_300_9000	Wow, you’re actually pretty nice.
A1_1820_TIM_300_1000	I bet Clefable’s really important to Mrs. Denis.
A1_1820_PIKACHU_400_1000	Did anything strange happen today?
A1_1820_PIXY_400_1000	Fae.
A1_1820_PIKACHU_400_2000	Clefable’s saying <color=#F39800FF>she got real sleepy while playing in\nthe mansion this morning</color>.
A1_1820_PIXY_400_2000	Fae fae.
A1_1820_PIKACHU_400_3000	Then she dozed off and doesn’t know what happened\nafter that.
A1_1820_TIM_400_1000	That’s too bad...
A1_1820_PIKACHU_500_1000	Whaddya think of Barnes? Do you get along with him\nall right?
A1_1820_PIXY_500_1000	Fae fae...
A1_1820_PIKACHU_500_2000	Claudia doesn’t like Barnes...
A1_1820_PIKACHU_500_3000	so Clefable tries not to have much to do with him.
A1_1820_PIXY_500_2000	Fae.
A1_1820_PIKACHU_500_4000	But she doesn’t think Barnes is a bad person.
A1_1820_PIKACHU_500_5000	After all, she says, Barnes ran to help Turner when he\ngot hurt.
A1_1820_TIM_500_1000	Wait, does that mean Clefable saw Barnes going\nupstairs to help Turner?!
A1_1820_PIKACHU_500_6000	Yeah, it’s gotta!
A1_1820_PIKACHU_500_7000	Clefable, what else can you tell us?!
A1_1820_PIXY_500_3000	Fae faaae.
A1_1820_PIKACHU_500_8000	Clefable was dozing near the front door this morning.
A1_1820_PIKACHU_500_9000	When Barnes got home from doing stuff outside,\nshe woke up and greeted him at the door.
A1_1820_PIXY_500_4000	Fae! Fae fae faaae fae fae!
A1_1820_PIKACHU_500_10000	<color=#F39800FF>Then, Clefable and Barnes heard Turner cry out on\nthe second floor, so they both went running upstairs.</color>
A1_1820_PIKACHU_500_11000	And that’s when, to their surprise, they found Turner\non the floor.
A1_1820_TIM_500_2000	That means when Turner was attacked...Barnes was\nstill on the first floor!
A1_1820_PIXY_600_1000	Fae!
A1_1820_PIKACHU_600_1000	She says <color=#F39800FF>she has way better hearing than most\nPokémon do</color>.
A1_1820_PIXY_600_2000	Fae fae.
A1_1820_PIKACHU_600_2000	Wow... You can hear footsteps and voices coming\nfrom any room in the mansion?
A1_1820_TIM_600_1000	That’s incredible!
A1_1820_PIKACHU_600_3000	Now that you mention it, I’m pretty sure I’ve heard\nthat Clefable can hear sounds over half a mile away!
A1_1820_TIM_600_2000	Half a mile?! A human could never DREAM of having\nhearing like that!
A1_1820_PIXY_600_3000	Fae?! Faaae!
A1_1820_PIKACHU_600_4000	Er, could you speak more softly, Tim? She says her\nears are sensitive to loud noises...
A1_1820_TIM_600_3000	Oh no... I’m sorry, Clefable. I’ll try to keep it down\nfrom now on.
A1_1830_BRAD_100_1000	What do you want, “Great Detective”?
A1_1830_TIM_100_1000	Have you finished questioning Barnes?
A1_1830_BRAD_100_2000	For now, anyway. We just haven’t finished gathering\nour evidence.
A1_1830_BRAD_100_3000	Doesn’t change the fact that Barnes is still a suspect.
A1_1830_TIM_100_2000	If you don’t mind, could we ask you some questions?
A1_1830_BRAD_100_4000	If you insist, but I have no intention of sharing\nconfidential information with you.
A1_1830_BRAD_200_1000	Did you still need something?
A1_1830_SEL_0_1000	About Barnes...
A1_1830_SEL_0_2000	About the investigation...
A1_1830_TIM_300_1000	Is the storage room key the reason the police suspect\nBarnes?
A1_1830_BRAD_300_1000	Oh, so you know that much already? Well, no point in\ndenying it.
A1_1830_BRAD_300_2000	The only two people who can access the key are the\nhomeowner and his butler—Mr. Denis and Barnes.
A1_1830_BRAD_300_3000	I highly doubt Mr. Denis staged all of this himself,\nwhich leaves Barnes as the only logical suspect.
A1_1830_BRAD_300_4000	Not only that, there were Ducklett feathers at the\ncrime scene—and Barnes’s partner is a Ducklett.
A1_1830_BRAD_300_5000	Clearly, Barnes used the key to get inside the storage\nroom, then had Ducklett fly off with the jewel.
A1_1830_BRAD_300_6000	That’s my working theory.
A1_1830_TIM_300_2000	Duly noted...
A1_1830_BRAD_300_7000	We don’t have any decisive evidence yet.
A1_1830_BRAD_300_8000	But we’re going to find this Ducklett that flew the\ncoop, and then we’ll get definitive proof—you’ll see.
A1_1830_TIM_300_3000	Well, I’ll be continuing my own investigation.
A1_1830_BRAD_300_9000	Hmph. Suit yourself.
A1_1830_TIM_400_1000	Are you following any leads other than Barnes?
A1_1830_BRAD_400_1000	Of course we are. We’ve already collected statements\nfrom every last person in this house.
A1_1830_TIM_400_2000	Do you mind if I ask what your impression of each\nof them was?
A1_1830_BRAD_400_2000	Well...I suppose I could tell you that much.
A1_1830_BRAD_400_3000	Mr. Denis seems rather shaken by Barnes falling under\nsuspicion.
A1_1830_BRAD_400_4000	And his wife Claudia is reacting quite...impetuously.
A1_1830_BRAD_400_5000	She’s been approaching us, repeatedly, to demand\nthat we hurry and wrap up our investigation.
A1_1830_PIKACHU_400_1000	Oof, that’s gotta be tough. I almost feel bad for Brad.
A1_1830_BRAD_400_6000	One of their staff members, Turner, has been very\ncooperative with our investigations.
A1_1830_BRAD_400_7000	He’s told us a lot about everything that happened up\nuntil he lost consciousness.
A1_1830_BRAD_400_8000	I suppose that’s all I can say for now.
A1_1830_TIM_400_3000	Thank you. We’ll keep all that in mind.
A1_1830_PIKACHU_400_2000	The police can question people, but they can’t talk to\nPokémon.
A1_1830_PIKACHU_400_3000	Interviewing the Pokémon around here might help us\npaint a clearer picture of what went down.
A1_1840_LIVOLT01_100_1000	Manec...
A1_1840_PIKACHU_100_1000	No need to glare at us like that, Manectric!
A1_1840_LIVOLT01_100_2000	Manectric!
A1_1840_PIKACHU_100_2000	Calm down, already! We’re not gonna get in the way\nof your police work!
A1_1840_TIM_100_1000	Brad’s Manectric sure is committed to the job.
A1_1840_PIKACHU_100_3000	True. And he’s been keeping watch, so if anyone tried\nto hide some evidence, he’d spot it right away.
A1_1840_PIKACHU_100_4000	I guess he is helpful in that way, but...
A1_1840_LIVOLT01_100_3000	Manec!
A1_1840_PIKACHU_100_5000	I just wish he’d dial back his aggression toward me.
A1_1840_LIVOLT01_200_1000	Manec!
A1_1840_PIKACHU_200_1000	What?! What’d I ever do to you?!
A1_1850_DHPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	This room is currently under police investigation.\nOnly authorized personnel are permitted.
A1_1860_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like the police are done questioning Barnes,\nbut they’re still searching the room.
A1_1860_TIM_100_1000	Right. Let’s investigate somewhere else.
A1_1870_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like the only way to continue our investigation\nis to gather info in the city.
A1_1870_TIM_100_1000	But where should we go?
A1_1870_TIM_100_2000	Should we go after Ducklett or search for the red\nPokémon?
A1_1870_PIKACHU_100_2000	If you’re unsure, why don’t we try following Ducklett?
A1_1870_PIKACHU_100_3000	I think we have a better lead to go on for that than\nfor the red Pokémon.
A1_1870_TIM_100_3000	Oh, right. We did hear that Ducklett was supposed\nto go buy coffee beans today.
A1_1870_PIKACHU_100_4000	I’ll bet you she went to the Hi-Hat Café.
A1_1870_TIM_100_4000	You’re right. We should probably go search the café.
A1_1870_PIKACHU_100_5000	Let’s not waste any time, Tim!
A1_19001_TIM_100_1000	These are the medals we received.
A1_19001_PIKACHU_100_1000	They’re proof of all the good we’ve done with our\ngreat detective work. Let’s keep it up, Tim!
A1_19010_PIKACHU_100_1000	Mmm, that sweet smell is irresistible! They must be\nusing Combee’s honey.
A1_19010_TIM_100_1000	Let’s come back and try some after we’re done with\nthe case.
A1_19030_TIM_100_1000	These menu items use all sorts of different Berries.
A1_19030_PIKACHU_100_1000	With so many choices, they could cater to any\nPokémon’s tastes.
A1_19040_TIM_100_1000	The name of this painting is “Golden Sunrise.”\nAnd it depicts...
A1_19040_PIKACHU_100_1000	...Ho-Oh, a Pokémon that’s spoken of in legends.
A1_19040_PIKACHU_100_2000	They say it brings eternal happiness, and that its\nwings shine with rainbow-colored light.
A1_19040_TIM_100_2000	Rainbow-colored light, huh? The painting sure is\nbeautiful, but I’ll bet the real thing is even more\nbreathtaking.
A1_1905_MAMEPATO01_100_1000	Coo coo!
A1_1905_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, if it isn’t Pidove! Glad to see you’re feeling\nbetter now.
A1_1905_MAMEPATO01_100_2000	Coo?
A1_1905_PIKACHU_100_2000	Who am I? Whaddya mean? I just rescued you a little\nwhile ago!
A1_1905_MAMEPATO01_100_3000	Coo?
A1_1905_PIKACHU_100_3000	It’s forgotten the whole thing...
A1_1905_TIM_100_1000	Well, Pidove are known for their forgetfulness.
A1_1905_MAMEPATO01_200_1000	Coo coo!
A1_1905_PIKACHU_200_1000	No, not “nice to meet you!” We’ve already met!
A1_19050_TIM_100_1000	The name of this painting is “Silver Waves.”\nAnd it depicts...
A1_19050_PIKACHU_100_1000	...Lugia, a Pokémon known as the guardian of\nthe seas.
A1_19050_PIKACHU_100_2000	It’s rumored to live deep down on the ocean floor,\nbut no one’s ever seen it.
A1_19050_TIM_100_2000	That makes sense—the ocean floor’s not exactly a\nplace you’d just casually visit.
A1_19070_TIM_100_1000	Looks like some jeweling tools have been left in here.\nI wonder if Mr. Denis uses this room as a study too.
A1_19080_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s some tea to serve to visitors. I’d prefer coffee,\nmyself.
A1_1910_ELFUUN01_100_1000	Whimsi?
A1_1910_ELFUUN02_100_1000	Cott cott!
A1_1910_TIM_100_1000	They seem happy. What are they talking about?
A1_1910_PIKACHU_100_1000	They’re saying that no matter how many times they\nvisit this city, it’s always bustling and full of fun.
A1_1910_TIM_100_2000	Do you suppose they witnessed anything?
A1_1910_PIKACHU_100_2000	We can certainly ask!
A1_1910_TIM_200_1000	Do you mind if we ask some questions?
A1_1910_ELFUUN01_200_1000	Whim!
A1_1910_ELFUUN02_200_1000	Whimsi!
A1_1910_SEL_0_1000	About you, Whimsicott...
A1_1910_SEL_0_2000	About the cotton...
A1_1910_SEL_0_3000	How did you get into the Denis residence?
A1_1910_SEL_0_4000	About the red Pokémon...
A1_1910_SEL_0_5000	About Ducklett...
A1_1910_ELFUUN01_300_1000	Whim!
A1_1910_PIKACHU_300_1000	Oh, you ride on seasonal winds that take you all over\nthe world, huh?
A1_1910_TIM_300_1000	The city seems even livelier than usual whenever the\nWhimsicott arrive.
A1_1910_ELFUUN02_300_1000	Whimsi!
A1_1910_PIKACHU_300_2000	Ah, OK. Soon you’ll be leaving this city to travel\nsomewhere else.
A1_1910_ELFUUN01_300_2000	Whim!
A1_1910_PIKACHU_300_3000	Oh, you like coming here every year ’cause you can\nmeet so many different Pokémon?
A1_1910_PIKACHU_300_4000	Aww, I’m happy to hear that!
A1_1910_TIM_400_1000	Is this cotton yours?
A1_1910_ELFUUN01_400_1000	Whim whim!
A1_1910_PIKACHU_400_1000	Yeah, the Whimsicott say <color=#F39800FF>it’s theirs</color>.
A1_1910_TIM_400_2000	We actually found this in Mr. Denis’s mansion.
A1_1910_TIM_400_3000	I don’t suppose you’ve been in there?
A1_1910_ELFUUN01_400_2000	Whimsiii?
A1_1910_PIKACHU_400_2000	Maybe you have, maybe you haven’t?
A1_1910_PIKACHU_400_3000	C’mon... You’ve gotta remember at least that much.
A1_1910_ELFUUN02_400_1000	Whim siii!
A1_1910_PIKACHU_400_4000	Oh, this one does remember!
A1_1910_TIM_400_4000	What did it say?
A1_1910_PIKACHU_400_5000	It thinks it remembers going into the mansion while\nplaying with its friends.
A1_1910_TIM_400_5000	It “thinks” so? That’s not a very clear answer.
A1_1910_PIKACHU_400_6000	Yeah... Let’s ask for more details.
A1_1910_PIKACHU_500_1000	You said you might’ve been in the mansion, but how’d\nyou get inside?
A1_1910_ELFUUN01_500_1000	Whim!
A1_1910_PIKACHU_500_2000	Hmm? You went in through the window with your\nfriends? Why would ya do that?
A1_1910_ELFUUN02_500_1000	Whimsiii...
A1_1910_PIKACHU_500_3000	You don’t remember anything after eating breakfast\nthis morning? The heck does that mean?
A1_1910_PIKACHU_500_4000	Please, it’s really important. Just try to remember.
A1_1910_ELFUUN01_500_2000	Whim whimsiii!
A1_1910_PIKACHU_500_5000	Some human you don’t know asked you to do it?
A1_1910_PIKACHU_500_6000	What was this stranger like?
A1_1910_ELFUUN02_500_2000	Whim whimsiii.
A1_1910_PIKACHU_500_7000	You don’t remember because it was someone you’d\nnever seen before, huh?
A1_1910_PIKACHU_500_8000	Now look here—you might be an accessory to theft!
A1_1910_ELFUUN01_500_3000	Cott?
A1_1910_PIKACHU_500_9000	You have no idea what I’m talking about, do you...
A1_1910_TIM_500_1000	You think the Whimsicott may have been unknowingly\ninvolved in the crime?
A1_1910_PIKACHU_500_10000	If they were, they’re blissfully ignorant of it.
A1_1910_PIKACHU_500_11000	After all, playing pranks is kinda their whole deal.\nThis complicates things...
A1_1910_PIKACHU_600_1000	Have you two seen any red Pokémon around here?
A1_1910_ELFUUN01_600_1000	Cott cott!
A1_1910_PIKACHU_600_2000	Oh, Pawniard is red? And you’ve recently become\nfriends with one?
A1_1910_TIM_600_1000	Pawniard?
A1_1910_PIKACHU_600_3000	It’s a Pokémon with blades all over its body.
A1_1910_PIKACHU_600_4000	And it’s true that Pawniard’s pretty red.
A1_1910_ELFUUN02_600_1000	Whimsicott! Cott!
A1_1910_PIKACHU_600_5000	You often run into Pawniard at the terrace in\nSerenity Park?
A1_1910_PIKACHU_600_6000	And on windy days, you play with Pawniard by\npicking it up and flying it around.
A1_1910_ELFUUN01_600_2000	Whim!
A1_1910_PIKACHU_600_7000	They said they like to fly Pawniard all the way here\nfrom Serenity Park.
A1_1910_TIM_600_2000	Serenity Park is the big park just beyond here, right?
A1_1910_PIKACHU_600_8000	Yeah, and the terrace is way over on the far side.
A1_1910_TIM_600_3000	Maybe we can find Pawniard there.
A1_1910_TIM_600_4000	Do you remember when you last played with\nPawniard?
A1_1910_ELFUUN01_600_3000	Whim?
A1_1910_ELFUUN02_600_2000	Whimsi?
A1_1910_PIKACHU_600_9000	Oh, lately you’ve been playing together every day?\nEven today?
A1_1910_TIM_600_5000	In that case, we might be able to find it there now.
A1_1910_ELFUUN01_600_4000	Whimsi...
A1_1910_PIKACHU_600_10000	<color=#F39800FF>If we go meet Pawniard, we should be careful about\nhow we treat its favorite rock?</color>
A1_1910_TIM_600_6000	It has a favorite rock?
A1_1910_ELFUUN01_600_5000	Whimsiii... Whim...
A1_1910_PIKACHU_600_11000	Apparently there’s a rock at the terrace that Pawniard\nreally cares about.
A1_1910_PIKACHU_600_12000	One time they accidentally stepped on it, and then\nPawniard got mad—real mad.
A1_1910_TIM_600_7000	Wow, that’s scary.
A1_1910_TIM_600_8000	We’d better watch where we step.
A1_1910_TIM_700_1000	I don’t suppose they’ve seen Ducklett around,\nhave they?
A1_1910_ELFUUN01_700_1000	Whim?
A1_1910_ELFUUN02_700_1000	Whimsiii!
A1_1910_ELFUUN01_700_2000	Whim whim!
A1_1910_PIKACHU_700_1000	OK, OK, I get it! You didn’t see her!
A1_1910_ELFUUN02_700_2000	Whimsiii!
A1_1910_TIM_700_2000	If they didn’t see her, I wonder where she went...
A1_19110_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wow, what a great-looking drumset. I think I’ll take it\nfor a whirl.
A1_19110_TIM_100_1000	Please don’t. The café’s open right now, you know.
A1_19120_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s Pablo’s piano.
A1_19120_TIM_100_1000	I doubt he has much time to play it when the\ncafé’s busy.
A1_19130_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oooh, a contrabass? Now that’s stylish!
A1_19130_PIKACHU_100_2000	I think I’ll give it a strum.
A1_19130_TIM_100_1000	Stop it. The café’s open right now, you know.
A1_19140_TIM_100_1000	Records and sheet music... This is Pablo’s collection.
A1_19140_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s got everything from old classics to the newest\nhits. He must have a broad taste in music.
A1_19150_PIKACHU_100_1000	This instrument is called a conga. Did you know that?\nYou tap out the beat with both hands.
A1_19150_PIKACHU_100_2000	Even I can play this thing!
A1_19150_TIM_100_1000	C’mon, now’s really not the time for that!
A1_19160_TIM_100_1000	Some kids are walking on railway tracks.\nWhat movie is this?
A1_19160_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a famous movie about some kids and their\nsummer adventure.
A1_19160_TIM_100_2000	You sure seem to know a lot about it, Pikachu.\nOh, look! A big group of Bidoof appeared! Wow!
A1_19160_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh yeah, such an emotional scene... Wait, I can’t keep\nwatching—I’ll forget about the case! Let’s go, Tim!
A1_19170_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, looks like Pablo’s got some new coffee beans!
A1_19170_PIKACHU_100_2000	Maybe tonight I’ll come back by myself to try\nthem out.
A1_19170_TIM_100_1000	Which means I’ll be paying your tab, as always, so\ndon’t go overboard, OK?
A1_19180_TIM_100_1000	What a beautiful jewel!
A1_19180_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s so clear and sparkly... Absolutely brilliant!
A1_19190_TIM_100_1000	A green jewel.
A1_19190_PIKACHU_100_1000	That fresh green color reminds me of the forest.\nJust looking at it is calming.
A1_1920_TIM_100_1000	Do you suppose Pawniard is the red Pokémon we’re\nlooking for?
A1_1920_PIKACHU_100_1000	Apparently, it’s good friends with the Whimsicott that\nwent into the mansion.
A1_1920_PIKACHU_100_2000	So it seems pretty likely.
A1_1920_PIKACHU_100_3000	It’d probably be fastest just to go meet it and ask.
A1_1920_TIM_300_1000	Whimsicott said they often meet up with Pawniard in\nSerenity Park, right?
A1_1920_PIKACHU_300_1000	Right. Searching there may be our best shot at finding\nPawniard.
A1_1920_PIKACHU_300_2000	No time like the present—let’s head over, Tim!
A1_1920_TIM_400_1000	But we still have to track down Ducklett.
A1_1920_PIKACHU_400_1000	Should we look for Ducklett or Pawniard first?
A1_1920_PIKACHU_400_2000	Either is fine by me.
A1_1920_PIKACHU_400_3000	We can start with whichever one you like.
A1_1920_TIM_400_2000	Thanks, Pikachu.
A1_19200_TIM_100_1000	This one’s a blue jewel.
A1_19200_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a deep blue, like the ocean. It has a kind of\nmagical feeling to it.
A1_19210_TIM_100_1000	It’s a red jewel.
A1_19210_PIKACHU_100_1000	What a vibrant red, like boiling-hot lava. It’s almost\ntoo bright to look at.
A1_1931_TIM_100_1000	It ran down this street, right?
A1_1931_TIM_100_2000	Let’s follow it so we can ask some questions.
A1_1931_PIKACHU_100_1000	I just hope we can find it.
A1_1935_TIM_100_1000	Huh? It’s not here...
A1_1935_PIKACHU_100_1000	Must be hiding somewhere.
A1_1935_PIKACHU_100_2000	Well, no point hangin’ around here. Let’s go interview\nsomeone else.
A1_1940_TIM_100_1000	Ah! It got away again...
A1_1940_PIKACHU_100_1000	It seems real scared of humans.
A1_1946_TIM_100_1000	This place is huge!
A1_1946_PIKACHU_300_1000	That’s Serenity Park for you.
A1_1946_TIM_300_1000	Whimsicott said Pawniard hangs out around here.
A1_1946_PIKACHU_300_2000	And the terrace is their usual meetup spot.
A1_1946_PIKACHU_300_3000	Shall we go look?
A1_1946_PIKACHU_400_1000	This is Serenity Park.
A1_1946_PIKACHU_400_2000	It’s where everyone goes for a break from the\nbusy city.
A1_1946_TIM_400_1000	So it’s popular with people and Pokémon.
A1_1946_PIKACHU_400_3000	Yeah. Sometimes you’ll find Pokémon here you\nwouldn’t normally see in the city.
A1_1946_PIKACHU_400_4000	You might wanna swing by for a walk when you’ve got\nsome free time.
A1_1948_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a map of Serenity Park.
A1_1948_TIM_100_1000	This park’s huge...
A1_1948_PIKACHU_100_2000	The terrace is all the way on the other side.
A1_1960_NONAMEMURDOCH_100_1000	Oh dear—I forgot to introduce myself!
A1_1960_MURDOCH_100_1000	My name is Charles Merloch.
A1_1960_MURDOCH_100_2000	I’m a scientist working here in Ryme City to deepen\nour understanding of Pokémon.
A1_1960_PIKACHU_100_1000	A scientist, huh?
A1_1960_MURDOCH_100_3000	What’s that? You’d like to hear more about what I do?
A1_1960_TIM_100_1000	Actually, I—
A1_1960_MURDOCH_100_4000	My research has been recognized by Mayor Myers\nhimself!
A1_1960_MURDOCH_100_5000	Now I’m helping out with a new policy that he and\nthe city council are working on.
A1_1960_MURDOCH_100_6000	You might say I’m the brains behind Ryme City’s\nlatest policies!
A1_1960_TIM_100_2000	This guy is intense...
A1_1960_PIKACHU_100_2000	And he seems like the type who doesn’t even listen to\nwhat others are saying.
A1_1960_MURDOCH_100_7000	If you two great detectives have any questions for me,\nby all means, fire away!
A1_1960_MURDOCH_100_8000	After all, I have something in common with you both.
A1_1960_MURDOCH_100_9000	We’re all working to help Ryme City!
A1_1960_MURDOCH_100_10000	We’re all coming from the same place—comrades with\nthe same goals.
A1_1960_MURDOCH_100_11000	So I’m prepared to answer any questions you have.
A1_1960_TIM_100_3000	Um, thank you...
A1_1960_PIKACHU_100_3000	Guess our only choice is to play along for a bit. What\na drag...
A1_1960_SEL_0_1000	About your research...
A1_1960_SEL_0_2000	Helping with a policy?
A1_1960_TIM_300_1000	What sort of research are you doing, Mr. Merloch?
A1_1960_MURDOCH_300_1000	My research explores the nature of communication\nbetween people and Pokémon.
A1_1960_TIM_300_2000	Sounds complicated...
A1_1960_MURDOCH_300_2000	No, it’s quite simple, really.
A1_1960_MURDOCH_300_3000	We’re just trying to help Pokémon understand\nhuman language.
A1_1960_MURDOCH_300_4000	Imagine what that’d do for Ryme City—
A1_1960_MURDOCH_300_5000	It’d make life here so much more entertaining\nand simple!
A1_1960_PIKACHU_300_1000	A whole city where people and Pokémon can go back\nand forth like we can, huh?
A1_1960_TIM_300_3000	That really would make Ryme City an even\nbetter place.
A1_1960_MURDOCH_300_6000	Don’t you think?
A1_1960_TIM_400_1000	What exactly do you do to help the mayor with\npolicy development?
A1_1960_MURDOCH_400_1000	My domain is science, not politics. I can’t actually\npropose new legislation.
A1_1960_MURDOCH_400_2000	What I can do, though, is develop new machines\nand equipment.
A1_1960_MURDOCH_400_3000	I also help distribute them to the people and\nPokémon of Ryme City.
A1_1960_MURDOCH_400_4000	I’m proud to contribute to my city with the power\nof science!
A1_1960_TIM_400_2000	That’s wonderful.
A1_1960_MURDOCH_400_5000	Isn’t it?!
A1_1960_MURDOCH_400_6000	Mayor Myers came up with the idea for a bill to help\npeople and Pokémon coexist...
A1_1960_MURDOCH_400_7000	so I feel duty-bound to use my position as a scientist\nto support it!
A1_1960_PIKACHU_400_1000	Sounds like he’s warming up for a speech...
A1_1960_TIM_400_3000	I can tell how passionate you are about improving\nthe city.
A1_1980_MURDOCH_100_1000	Oh dear, is Pikachu upset with me?
A1_1980_MURDOCH_100_2000	I only plucked a bit of fur, and the test results should\nbe ready in just a moment.
A1_1980_TIM_100_1000	What exactly are you doing?
A1_1980_MURDOCH_100_3000	This is a machine I created at Mayor Myers’s request.
A1_1980_MURDOCH_100_4000	It can measure a Pokémon’s vital signs in record time.
A1_1980_MURDOCH_100_5000	In other words, it’s made to quickly check a\nPokémon’s health.
A1_1980_MURDOCH_100_6000	I’d say that’s a good thing for both people and their\npartners, wouldn’t you?
A1_1980_TIM_100_2000	Yes, it sure sounds like it.
A1_1980_PIKACHU_100_1000	Way to bury the lede...
A1_1980_MURDOCH_100_7000	OK, it’s ready! Now let me see... Hmm?!
A1_1980_TIM_100_3000	What’s it say?
A1_1980_MURDOCH_100_8000	It’s detecting...caffeine?
A1_1980_PIKACHU_100_2000	Did someone say caffeine?
A1_1980_MURDOCH_100_9000	Seeing as he’s working as a detective, I figured this\nwas no ordinary Pikachu...
A1_1980_MURDOCH_100_10000	but these results are truly fascinating!
A1_1980_TIM_100_4000	Uh... Hello? Mr. Merloch?
A1_1980_MURDOCH_100_11000	Oh, do forgive me! He’s quite all right—no problems\nat all.
A1_1980_MURDOCH_100_12000	I suppose his triglycerides are a bit high for a\nPokémon...
A1_1980_PIKACHU_100_3000	My WHAT?!
A1_1980_MURDOCH_100_13000	He does seem slightly different from a regular\nPikachu, though.
A1_1980_PIKACHU_100_4000	Huh? Is there something weird about me?
A1_1980_TIM_100_5000	Well, now that you’ve finished your checkup, I think\nwe’d better get going.
A1_1980_MURDOCH_100_14000	Ah, yes, sorry to have taken up so much of your time.\nGood luck, great detectives!
A1_1980_TIM_100_6000	Thank you.
A1_1980_TIM_100_7000	Come on, Pikachu—stop sulking and let’s go!
A1_1980_PIKACHU_100_5000	High triglycerides... *grumble*
A1_2010_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Tim... What are you thinking?
A1_2010_TIM_100_1000	I’m pretty sure that window’s the one in front of the\njewel storage room.
A1_2010_TIM_100_2000	A Pokémon capable of flying could go straight into\nthe mansion from here.
A1_2010_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah. If our thief was getting help from a Pokémon,\nthis’d be the perfect vantage point.
A1_20110_TIM_100_1000	Are you done investigating with Growlithe for now?
A1_20110_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_20110_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_20110_PIKACHU_300_1000	Yeah, that should be plenty.
A1_20110_PIKACHU_300_2000	Thanks, Growlithe!
A1_20110_GARDIE_300_1000	Gow!
A1_20110_PIKACHU_400_1000	No, there’s still something I wanna check out.
A1_20110_TIM_400_1000	OK. Just let me know when you’re finished.
A1_20120_DENIS_100_1000	Oh? Are you two going somewhere?
A1_20120_GARDIE_100_1000	(Just you wait, Sanjee! I’m gonna do my best to help!)
A1_20120_DENIS_100_2000	You looked so down earlier, Growlithe, but you sure\nseem to have cheered up!
A1_20120_DENIS_100_3000	Is that thanks to Pikachu? Regardless, you two be\ncareful out there!
A1_20120_PIKACHU_100_1000	You may not be able to speak to each other, but he\nsure seemed to understand your feelings, Growlithe!
A1_20130_HOLIDAY_100_1000	Hm? Can I help you with something?
A1_20130_GARDIE_100_1000	(I’m gonna solve this case for you! Leave it to me!)
A1_20130_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wow, you’re really raring to go, aren’t you, Growlithe?
A1_20130_GARDIE_100_2000	(Yeah!)
A1_20140_TURNER_100_1000	Awww, look at you two playing together. Must be nice\nto be as carefree as a Pokémon...
A1_20140_GARDIE_100_1000	(We’re not playing! We’re going out to investigate\nthe case!)
A1_20140_GARDIE_100_2000	(Sheesh! How rude!)
A1_20140_PIKACHU_100_1000	They’ll take us seriously when we bring back some\nevidence, don’t worry!
A1_20150_CLAUDIA_100_1000	When in the world is this investigation going to be\nover, already?
A1_20150_GARDIE_100_1000	(Looks like she’s in a bad mood...)
A1_20150_PIKACHU_100_1000	Maybe we should give her some space for now.
A1_20160_PIXY_100_1000	(Why are you two goofing around at a time like this?)
A1_20160_GARDIE_100_1000	(We’re not goofing around! I’m helping the\ndetectives.)
A1_20160_PIXY_100_2000	(Sounds like goofing around to me.)
A1_20160_PIXY_100_3000	(Please, don’t make Claudia more upset than she\nalready is!)
A1_20160_PIXY_100_4000	(I really wish you would just quiet down!)
A1_20160_PIKACHU_100_1000	She’s so upset that she’s starting to act like Claudia.
A1_20160_GARDIE_100_2000	(She’s just worried about her.)
A1_20165_PIXY_100_1000	(Be quiet, you two!)
A1_20165_PIKACHU_100_1000	Sorry, but this is part of the investigation.
A1_20170_BURNS_100_1000	How could this have happened?
A1_20170_GARDIE_100_1000	(Don’t feel bad, Mr. Barnes!)
A1_20170_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s hurry and find the real culprit so we can clear\nhis name.
A1_20190_LIVOLT02_100_1000	(Aren’t you supposed to be a detective? Do you\nreally have time to be playing with Growlithe?)
A1_20190_PIKACHU_100_1000	She’s helping with our investigation. Can’t you tell?
A1_20190_GARDIE_100_1000	(That’s right! We’re gonna solve this case together!)
A1_20190_LIVOLT02_100_1500	(Ah. My apologies.)
A1_20190_PIKACHU_100_2000	You’re not gonna tell us to stay out of the police’s\nway or anything?
A1_20190_LIVOLT02_100_2000	(I’m simply following orders and doing my duty.)
A1_20190_PIKACHU_100_3000	Sounds like all Manectric are really serious.
A1_20190_GARDIE_100_2000	(Come on, Pikachu! We should hurry!)
A1_20195_LIVOLT02_100_1000	(Sorry about earlier.)
A1_20195_GARDIE_100_1000	(I’m just glad we cleared up that misunderstanding.)
A1_2020_TIM_100_1000	What’s this cotton doing here?
A1_2020_PIKACHU_100_1000	Just looks like trash to me.
A1_20200_DHPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	Oh look, you’re friends already! Having fun playing\ntogether?
A1_20200_GARDIE_100_1000	(We’re not playing! We’re working!)
A1_20200_DHPOLICEMAN01_100_2000	Aww, let me pet you cuties.
A1_20200_GARDIE_100_2000	(Hey! Stop interrupting our work!)
A1_20210_PIKACHU_100_1000	What’s this room here?
A1_20210_GARDIE_100_1000	(That’s Mr. Barnes’s room.)
A1_20210_GARDIE_100_2000	(But Sanjee says not to go in there.)
A1_20210_PIKACHU_100_2000	Then we’d better do as Denis says and look\nsomewhere else instead.
A1_2030_TIM_100_1000	This is where the Whimsicott usually meet up with\nPawniard, right?
A1_2030_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s what they said, but I don’t see it anywhere.
A1_2030_TIM_100_2000	If it was here earlier, maybe it left some kind of a sign.
A1_2030_PIKACHU_100_2000	Well, Pawniard are known for their blades... It’s not\nmuch, but it’s the only lead we’ve got.
A1_2030_PIKACHU_100_3000	We’d better get looking.
A1_20310_DKPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	Detective Pikachu... What are you up to now?
A1_20310_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m investigating...but I know you humans don’t\nunderstand me.
A1_20320_DAPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	We’re working in here. You can’t come in.
A1_20330_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s look around in this room too.
A1_20330_GARDIE_100_1000	(No, this is Claudia’s room! We definitely can’t go\nin there!)
A1_20330_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh, whoops, you’re right... Let’s look somewhere else\nfor now.
A1_20340_GARDIE_100_1000	(The shiny rocks in this room look like they’d taste\nsweet...)
A1_20340_PIKACHU_100_1000	...Don’t even think about it.
A1_20340_GARDIE_100_2000	(I just said they LOOKED sweet! I’m not actually\ngonna eat them!)
A1_2035_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, where are you going?
A1_2035_PIKACHU_300_1000	Those traces we found might have been left\nby Pawniard!
A1_2035_PIKACHU_300_2000	Why don’t we organize all our information in your\ncase notebook?
A1_2035_PIKACHU_400_1000	Let’s have a look around—maybe we’ll find something\nthat tells us a Pawniard’s been here.
A1_2040_TIM_100_1000	What’s up with this rock?
A1_2040_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s covered in gashes. Has something been scratching\nat it...?
A1_2040_TIM_100_2000	<color=#F39800FF>These gashes look like they were left by something\nsharp, like a blade.</color>
A1_2040_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hmm... I doubt a human would be strong enough\nto make clean cuts like these.
A1_20405_GARDIE_100_1000	(I’m picking up Ducklett’s scent around here.)
A1_20405_GARDIE_100_2000	(Ducklett always leaves this way when she takes walks\nand goes shopping.)
A1_20405_GARDIE_100_3000	(Her scent is still lingering here!)
A1_20405_PIKACHU_100_1000	If we follow that smell, we should be able to\nfind Ducklett.
A1_20405_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s track the scent carefully—don’t wanna lose it!
A1_20405_GARDIE_100_4000	(Right!)
A1_20410_DCPOLICEWOMAN02_100_1000	Oh my goodness, how darling!
A1_20410_GARDIE_100_1000	(Huh?! Wh-what?!)
A1_20410_DCPOLICEWOMAN02_100_2000	You’re both so fluffy! Please, let me pet you!
A1_20410_GARDIE_100_2000	(Huh? I’m not sure what you’re going on about, but\ncan you wait till later? We’re busy!)
A1_20415_MAMEPATO01_100_1000	(We’re Pidove! Who are you?)
A1_20415_GARDIE_100_1000	(I’m Growlithe! Nice to meet you!)
A1_20415_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m the great Detective Pikachu.
A1_20415_PIKACHU_100_2000	...Which you should know, since, y’know, I helped you\nout earlier.
A1_20420_GARDIE_100_1000	(This scent...)
A1_20420_PIKACHU_100_1000	Did you find her?
A1_20420_GARDIE_100_2000	(Yes! I’m sure of it!)
A1_20420_GARDIE_100_3000	(Come on out, Ducklett! It’s your pal Growlithe!)
A1_20435_KOARUHIE_100_1000	(I was wondering who’d found me! It’s good to see\na friendly face.)
A1_20435_KOARUHIE_100_2000	(Wait—who’s that on your back?)
A1_20435_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hi there. I’m the great Detective Pikachu.
A1_20435_KOARUHIE_100_3000	(And you’re a friend of Growlithe’s?)
A1_20435_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’d like to think so. Puttin’ that aside, though,\ncould you tell me why you’re way out here?
A1_20435_KOARUHIE_100_4000	(Some strange humans were chasing me!)
A1_20435_KOARUHIE_100_5000	(It was really scary...)
A1_20435_KOARUHIE_100_6000	(I don’t know what I could have possibly done to\nmake them so upset.)
A1_20435_PIKACHU_100_3000	They think you may have been involved in a crime.
A1_20435_KOARUHIE_100_7000	(Huh? What crime?)
A1_20435_GARDIE_100_1000	(Something precious was stolen from the house.)
A1_20435_PIKACHU_100_4000	And you and Barnes are currently under suspicion.
A1_20435_KOARUHIE_100_8000	(Say whaaat?!)
A1_20435_KOARUHIE_100_9000	(Neither of us would EVER do something like that!)
A1_20435_PIKACHU_100_5000	I know. I don’t think it was you.
A1_20440_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’ll need to ask you some questions to help prove your\ninnocence—and Barnes’s too. Is that all right?
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_100_1000	(I guess...)
A1_20440_SEL_0_1000	About you, Ducklett...
A1_20440_SEL_0_2000	About Barnes...
A1_20440_SEL_0_3000	Why are you here?
A1_20440_SEL_0_4000	At the time of the incident...
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_300_1000	(I’m Barnes’s partner.)
A1_20440_GARDIE_300_1000	(You’re always helping him out because he’s so\nbusy, right?)
A1_20440_PIKACHU_300_1000	Like when you buy beans at the Hi-Hat Café?
A1_20440_PIKACHU_300_2000	Barnes must have good taste—much like myself!
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_300_2000	(You drink that black water too?!)
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_300_3000	(I tried it once, because Barnes seems to enjoy it\nso much...)
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_300_4000	(but I practically gagged when it hit my tongue.\nToo bitter!)
A1_20440_PIKACHU_300_3000	Heh! It’s a sophisticated flavor for sophisticated\nPokémon.
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_300_5000	(Yes, well... I’m sure I’ll be sophisticated like that\nsomeday. Just watch!)
A1_20440_PIKACHU_400_1000	Can you tell me about Barnes?
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_400_1000	(Barnes is my partner. He’s a true gentleman!)
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_400_2000	(If you’ve met him, I’m sure you understand what\nI mean.)
A1_20440_PIKACHU_400_2000	Yep—though I think I might have him beat in the\ngentleman department.
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_400_3000	(...Right. Anyway, he’s really good about telling me\nwhen I’ve done something well.)
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_400_4000	(I may not look like it, but I’m actually a really\ngood swimmer!)
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_400_5000	(Barnes always compliments me when I show off my\nfancy swimming techniques in the fountain.)
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_400_6000	(No one that lovely could possibly be a bad person!)
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_400_7000	(Right? RIGHT?!)
A1_20440_PIKACHU_400_3000	Like I said, I don’t think he did it.
A1_20440_GARDIE_400_1000	(Don’t worry, Ducklett.)
A1_20440_GARDIE_400_2000	(We’ll clear Barnes’s name!)
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_400_8000	(Thank you, Growlithe.)
A1_20440_PIKACHU_500_1000	Why were you hiding here?
A1_20440_PIKACHU_500_2000	There must have been plenty of other places you\ncould’ve picked.
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_500_1000	(This is my favorite spot.)
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_500_2000	(And like I told you, I got chased around by a\nbunch of strangers.)
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_500_3000	(I was feeling pretty ruffled, so I came here\nto calm down.)
A1_20440_PIKACHU_500_3000	Gotcha.
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_500_4000	<color=#F39800FF>(See that water over there? I looove bathing in it!)</color>
A1_20440_GARDIE_500_1000	(Oh yeah? Maybe I should try it too...)
A1_20440_PIKACHU_500_4000	Whoa there, Growlithe—aren’t you a Fire type?\nPretty sure a bath’s a bad idea.
A1_20440_GARDIE_500_2000	(Oh, good point!)
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_500_5000	(Walking by the waterside feels lovely too.\nIt’s nice and cool, without all the wetness.)
A1_20440_GARDIE_500_3000	(Sweet! I’ll try that instead. Thanks, Ducklett!)
A1_20440_PIKACHU_600_1000	What were you up to this morning, before the\nincident occurred?
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_600_1000	(All I did was eat breakfast, like always.)
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_600_2000	(Then I got really sleepy, NOT like always.)
A1_20440_PIKACHU_600_2000	If you fell asleep after breakfast, when did you\ngo out?
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_600_3000	(Well, at some point Turner woke me up.)
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_600_4000	(I usually go out shopping right after Barnes asks\nme to...)
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_600_5000	(But today I was in a hurry because I overslept, so I\nrushed to grab my bag and flew out from a window\non the second floor.)
A1_20440_PIKACHU_600_3000	And you’re sure it was Turner who woke you up?
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_600_6000	(Yes, I’m sure.)
A1_20440_PIKACHU_600_4000	And Growlithe, you fell asleep too?
A1_20440_GARDIE_600_1000	(Yep. But only because today’s breakfast was\nso yummy!)
A1_20440_GARDIE_600_2000	(I guess I ate so much I got sleepy after.)
A1_20440_PIKACHU_600_5000	Do you two always eat your meals together?
A1_20440_GARDIE_600_3000	(Not usually, no.)
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_600_7000	<color=#F39800FF>(I always eat with Cramorant.)</color>
A1_20440_PIKACHU_600_6000	What? There’s a Cramorant in the household?
A1_20440_GARDIE_600_4000	(Yep!)
A1_20440_KOARUHIE_600_8000	<color=#F39800FF>(Cramorant is Turner’s partner.)</color>
A1_20440_PIKACHU_600_7000	Huh. Is that so.
A1_20440_PIKACHU_600_8000	Bit strange that Turner never mentioned that...
A1_20450_PIKACHU_100_1000	So according to your story, Ducklett, you were out on\nan errand when the crime took place.
A1_20450_PIKACHU_100_2000	But because you were asleep earlier, you’re not sure\nexactly what time you left...
A1_20450_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yeesh... If even Ducklett doesn’t know anything, how\nare we going to solve this case?
A1_20450_GARDIE_100_1000	(You mean we might never find the jewel?)
A1_20450_PIKACHU_100_4000	No, we’ve still got one more lead: the Cramorant that\nDucklett mentioned.
A1_20450_PIKACHU_100_5000	I’m wondering why we never saw it in the mansion.
A1_20450_PIKACHU_100_6000	How long has Cramorant been gone?
A1_20450_GARDIE_100_2000	(I don’t know. By the time I noticed, he was\nalready gone.)
A1_20450_PIKACHU_100_7000	We should probably go talk to him, then. Can you\ntrack Cramorant down by scent, Growlithe?
A1_20450_GARDIE_100_3000	(If you have something with Cramorant’s scent on it,\nthen sure.)
A1_20450_PIKACHU_100_8000	Hmm. I don’t suppose you could use this?
A1_20450_KOARUHIE_100_1000	(Oh, that’s one of Cramorant’s feathers!)
A1_20450_PIKACHU_100_9000	Just as I thought. Good thing I picked it up earlier.
A1_20450_GARDIE_100_4000	(With that, I can definitely track Cramorant’s scent!)
A1_20450_PIKACHU_100_10000	Now we just have to figure out where to pick up\nthe trail...
A1_20450_PIKACHU_100_11000	Since Cramorant seems to have left the mansion,\nwe should probably try around the front gate.
A1_20450_KOARUHIE_100_2000	(What should I do? I’m really worried about Barnes.)
A1_20450_PIKACHU_100_12000	I understand how you feel, but if you go home now,\nthings’ll probably just get more complicated.
A1_20450_PIKACHU_100_13000	Can you wait here a little longer while we solve\nthe case?
A1_20450_KOARUHIE_100_3000	(OK... Please, I’m counting on both of you to\ntake care of Barnes!)
A1_20450_GARDIE_100_5000	(Leave it to us!)
A1_20450_PIKACHU_100_14000	Right, then. Let’s go, Growlithe!
A1_20455_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well? Did you get a whiff of Cramorant’s scent?
A1_20455_GARDIE_100_1000	(Yes, I’ve got it!)
A1_20455_GARDIE_100_2000	(It’s still quite strong, so Cramorant was probably\nwalking around here this morning.)
A1_20455_PIKACHU_100_2000	So we just need to follow that scent.
A1_20455_PIKACHU_100_3000	OK, Growlithe—follow your nose!
A1_20465_KOMATANA_100_1000	(State thy business.)
A1_20465_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’d like to ask you some questions. Do you have\na minute?
A1_20465_KOMATANA_100_2000	(Verily do I find myself with a moment to spare.)
A1_20465_PIKACHU_100_2000	Er... Thank you, good sir.
A1_20465_GARDIE_100_1000	(Huh? What’s going on? Why are you talking\nlike that?)
A1_20470_KOMATANA_100_1000	(Make thy queries known.)
A1_20470_SEL_0_1000	About thee, Pawniard...
A1_20470_SEL_0_2000	About the Denis residence...
A1_20470_PIKACHU_300_1000	What, uh...brings thou here?
A1_20470_KOMATANA_300_1000	(My training is as yet unfinished. I have selected\nthis locale to further hone my blades.)
A1_20470_GARDIE_300_1000	(Ooo... No wonder you look so strong.)
A1_20470_KOMATANA_300_2000	(I still have much to learn.)
A1_20470_PIKACHU_400_1000	So you really don’t remember going inside\nthe mansion?
A1_20470_KOMATANA_400_1000	(The mansion, you say...?)
A1_20470_KOMATANA_400_2000	(Mayhap I ventured inside that opulent domicile,\nbut I have no recollection of doing so.)
A1_20470_PIKACHU_400_2000	Hey, c’mon—you’ve gotta remember!
A1_20470_KOMATANA_400_3000	(Hmm...)
A1_20470_KOMATANA_400_4000	(The wind may have blown me in whilst I was in the\ncompany of my Whimsicott companions...)
A1_20470_KOMATANA_400_5000	(I beg pardon if mine actions have caused\ndisturbance.)
A1_20470_GARDIE_400_1000	(It’s OK! Everybody makes mistakes.)
A1_20470_GARDIE_400_2000	(You didn’t do anything wrong on purpose, so I’m\nsure Sanjee will forgive you.)
A1_20470_KOMATANA_400_6000	(Thou hast my gratitude.)
A1_20480_GARDIE_100_1000	(Oh!)
A1_20495_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s Lilligant.
A1_20495_PIKACHU_100_2000	This Pokémon is known for having an aroma that\ncalms the heart and mind.
A1_20495_GARDIE_100_1000	(So THAT’S what that nice smell was!)
A1_20495_DREDEAR_100_1000	(You think I smell nice? You’re sweet.)
A1_2050_TIM_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>These torn-up leaves have rough, uneven edges.</color>
A1_2050_TIM_100_2000	Do you suppose Pawniard did that?
A1_2050_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hmm, they look to me like they were bitten, not cut.
A1_20500_PIKACHU_100_1000	Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?
A1_20500_DREDEAR_100_1000	(Not at all.)
A1_20500_DREDEAR_100_2000	(Your timing is actually perfect—I was just taking\na break from dancing.)
A1_20500_DREDEAR_100_3000	(Ask me whatever you like.)
A1_20500_SEL_0_1000	About you, Lilligant...
A1_20500_SEL_0_2000	About this place...
A1_20500_SEL_0_3000	About sleep powder...
A1_20500_PIKACHU_300_1000	Can you tell me more about yourself?
A1_20500_DREDEAR_300_1000	(Getting personal, are we? Teehee.)
A1_20500_DREDEAR_300_2000	(Alas, I’m rather unremarkable. Just a Lilligant with a\nlove for dance.)
A1_20500_DREDEAR_300_3000	(You wouldn’t have to look hard to find many others\nlike me.)
A1_20500_PIKACHU_400_1000	What are you doing here?
A1_20500_DREDEAR_400_1000	(Why, this is my favorite place.)
A1_20500_DREDEAR_400_2000	(Basking in the sunlight here feels ever so good.)
A1_20500_DREDEAR_400_3000	(And dancing here fills me with endless joy!)
A1_20500_PIKACHU_400_2000	You dance here a lot, then?
A1_20500_DREDEAR_400_4000	(Yes. Sometimes humans and Pokémon even come\nto watch.)
A1_20500_DREDEAR_400_5000	(Everyone who watches me dance seems to fall\nasleep—but at least they’re smiling when they do.)
A1_20500_DREDEAR_400_6000	(Would you like a demonstration? La la laaa! ♪)
A1_20500_GARDIE_400_1000	(Ooh, nice...\n*yawn* I could really use a nap...)
A1_20500_PIKACHU_400_3000	W-wait, Lilligant—please don’t dance!
A1_20500_PIKACHU_500_1000	Is this your sleep powder?
A1_20500_DREDEAR_500_1000	(Yes. I recognize the fragrance.)
A1_20500_PIKACHU_500_2000	Do you remember giving this to anyone?
A1_20500_DREDEAR_500_2000	(No.)
A1_20500_DREDEAR_500_3000	(You see, my sleep powder just puffs out naturally\nwhenever I dance.)
A1_20500_DREDEAR_500_4000	(Though thinking on it now...)
A1_20500_DREDEAR_500_5000	(There was a human who came to watch me\ndance recently.)
A1_20500_PIKACHU_500_3000	Really?! Do you remember what they looked like?
A1_20500_DREDEAR_500_6000	(I’m afraid not. I was “in the zone.”)
A1_20500_GARDIE_500_1000	(Hmm... That’s ruff.)
A1_20500_PIKACHU_500_4000	Hey, it’s somethin’. Thanks for your help, Lilligant.
A1_20525_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a Venonat.
A1_20525_PIKACHU_100_2000	No mistakin’ those massive eyes! Apparently they can\neven see in the dark.
A1_20525_GARDIE_100_1000	(So sparkly!)
A1_20525_KONGPANG_100_1000	(Yes, yes, what is it, yes?)
A1_20530_PIKACHU_100_1000	Do you mind if we ask you some questions?
A1_20530_KONGPANG_100_1000	(OK. So. I’m really busy. But yes. Yes!)
A1_20530_SEL_0_1000	About you, Venonat...
A1_20530_SEL_0_2000	About this place...
A1_20530_SEL_0_3000	About sleep powder...
A1_20530_PIKACHU_300_1000	What’s got you so busy?
A1_20530_KONGPANG_300_1000	(Oh, nothing! I’m just eating, that’s all!)
A1_20530_KONGPANG_300_2000	(But I have to eat fast! Soon, it will be time for\ndinner—and more eating, yes, yes!)
A1_20530_PIKACHU_300_2000	You’ve got plenty of time till then though, right?\nAre you always in such a hurry?
A1_20530_KONGPANG_300_3000	(Yes, yes! At least, that’s what everyone tells me, yes!)
A1_20530_PIKACHU_300_3000	Have you tried maybe...chillin’ out a bit?
A1_20530_KONGPANG_300_4000	(Can’t! This is my natural state, yes, yes! Hee hee!)
A1_20530_PIKACHU_300_4000	Oookay...
A1_20530_GARDIE_300_1000	(Venonat sure is funny!)
A1_20530_PIKACHU_400_1000	What are you doing here?
A1_20530_KONGPANG_400_1000	(This spot is great because you can see the whole city\nand it’s lovely and pretty and nice.)
A1_20530_KONGPANG_400_2000	(And on top of that, many, many teeny-tiny bugs\ngather here at night—oh yes, it’s marvelous!)
A1_20530_GARDIE_400_1000	(Do you like bugs, Venonat?)
A1_20530_KONGPANG_400_3000	(Yes, yes! Very much so, yes! They’re my favorite\ntreat!)
A1_20530_GARDIE_400_2000	(Your favorite...treat?)
A1_20530_PIKACHU_400_2000	I, uh... I think we can drop this line of questioning.
A1_20530_PIKACHU_500_1000	Is this your sleep powder?
A1_20530_KONGPANG_500_1000	(Nope! Definitely not mine! No siree!)
A1_20530_GARDIE_500_1000	(How can you tell?)
A1_20530_KONGPANG_500_2000	(I use my sleep powder to catch prey.)
A1_20530_KONGPANG_500_3000	(It doesn’t smell this soothing or beautiful, nope,\nnope! Not one bit!)
A1_20530_PIKACHU_500_2000	I see.
A1_20530_KONGPANG_500_4000	(I do believe this is Lilligant’s fragrance. Oh yes!)
A1_20530_PIKACHU_500_3000	Yeah? And where would we find Lilligant?
A1_20530_KONGPANG_500_5000	(I would check one of the nearby hedges! Probably!\nNo, definitely! Yes!)
A1_20530_GARDIE_500_2000	(To the greenery!)
A1_20540_GARDIE_100_1000	(What happened to this rock? It’s all cut up!)
A1_20540_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s Pawniard’s favorite rock. I wouldn’t touch it,\nif I were you.
A1_20570_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a map of Serenity Park.
A1_20570_GARDIE_100_1000	(Sanjee and I come here for walks pretty often!\nIt’s really close to home.)
A1_20570_PIKACHU_100_2000	This is part of your typical route, huh?
A1_20580_PIKACHU_100_1000	Now we know how the sleep powder was obtained.
A1_20580_GARDIE_100_1000	(Are we done investigating?)
A1_20580_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_20580_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_20580_PIKACHU_300_1000	Yeah, and I’d like to tell Tim what we’ve found.\nLet’s hurry back, Growlithe!
A1_20580_GARDIE_300_1000	(Sure!)
A1_20580_PIKACHU_400_1000	No, there’s still a bit more I want to look into.\nDo you mind continuing for now, Growlithe?
A1_20580_GARDIE_400_1000	(Not at all!)
A1_2060_TIM_100_1000	Hmm, this cotton...
A1_2060_PIKACHU_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>It probably fell here when the Whimsicott were\nplaying with Pawniard.</color>
A1_20710_ELFUUN01_100_1000	(Look, look! Two best friends!)
A1_20710_ELFUUN02_100_1000	(You’re right. They do look like best friends. But we’re\neven better best friends.)
A1_20710_ELFUUN01_100_2000	(You think so?)
A1_20710_ELFUUN02_100_2000	(Yes, of course. We’re always together, you know.)
A1_20710_ELFUUN01_100_3000	(Hey, what do you think?)
A1_20710_ELFUUN02_100_3000	(What do you think?)
A1_20710_GARDIE_100_1000	(Well, if you’re always together, then I suppose you\nmust be best friends, right?)
A1_20710_ELFUUN01_100_4000	(See? We’re best friends!)
A1_20710_ELFUUN02_100_4000	(Oh, I see! I guess we’re best friends!)
A1_20710_PIKACHU_100_1000	Just listening to you two makes my head spin...
A1_20715_ELFUUN01_100_1000	(Look, look! Two best friends!)
A1_20715_ELFUUN02_100_1000	(You’re right. They do look like best friends.)
A1_20730_MIRUHOG_100_1000	(Heyyy, you look like you’re havin’ fun! Lemme\nplay too!)
A1_20730_PIKACHU_100_1000	Sorry, bud—this is serious business.
A1_20730_GARDIE_100_1000	(I can play with you after our investigation, if you\nwant.)
A1_20735_MIRUHOG_100_1000	(Heyyy, c’mon, lemme have fun too!)
A1_20735_GARDIE_100_1000	(When we’re done investigating, OK?)
A1_20740_GARDIE_100_1000	(Hm? Do you really need to search over there, too?)
A1_20740_PIKACHU_100_1000	Nah, you’re right. No need to go this way.
A1_20750_HARITEYAMA_100_1000	(It is I who is the most powerful!)
A1_20750_NYOROBON_100_1000	(Don’t make me laugh. I’m the most powerful\naround here!)
A1_20750_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like they’re gettin’ ready for a scrap.
A1_20750_GARDIE_100_1000	(We should probably keep our distance...)
A1_20755_HARITEYAMA_100_1000	(Are you issuing me a challenge?!)
A1_20755_NYOROBON_100_1000	(Maybe I am!)
A1_20755_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, it’s Hariyama and Poliwrath. Those two sure love\nflexin’ on each other.
A1_20755_PIKACHU_100_2000	I don’t wanna be around if they start dukin’ it out.\nLet’s go a different way.
A1_20760_DAGIRL01_100_1000	Ohmygosh, STOP. You two are SO cute! I love how\nyou’re just riding around together!!!
A1_20760_DAGIRL01_100_2000	You must be, like, BEST friends.
A1_20760_DAGIRL01_100_3000	I wish Hariyama and Poliwrath got along like you\ntwo do... *pout*
A1_2080_PIKACHU_100_1000	Can you think of any way to draw Pawniard here?
A1_2080_PIKACHU_200_1000	This isn’t working. We’d better try another angle.
A1_2080_SEL_0_1000	Sing near the rock
A1_2080_SEL_0_2000	Climb on the rock
A1_2080_SEL_0_3000	Wait next to the rock
A1_2080_TIM_300_1000	Uh... I guess you could try...singing? Around the rock?
A1_2080_PIKACHU_300_1000	A song! Good idea!
A1_2080_PIKACHU_300_2000	Guess it’s time for me to show off my golden pipes!
A1_2080_PIKACHU_300_3000	Ahem! And a-one, and a-two...
A1_2080_PIKACHU_300_4000	Haaa-ah-ahhh! ♪
A1_2080_TIM_300_2000	Maybe this wasn’t the best idea...
A1_2080_PIKACHU_300_5000	Nah, I’m just getting to the good part! It’ll come\nrunning for an autograph any second!
A1_2080_PIKACHU_300_6000	Haaa-ah-ahhh!♪
A1_2080_TIM_300_3000	...I don't think it’s gonna happen, Pikachu.
A1_2080_PIKACHU_300_7000	Huh. That’s strange... I wonder why...
A1_2080_PIKACHU_300_8000	Guess Pawniard just doesn’t have an ear for true art.
A1_2080_TIM_400_1000	Whimsicott said that Pawniard got angry when they\nstepped on the rock.
A1_2080_PIKACHU_400_1000	Oh yeah, you’re right—good memory.
A1_2080_TIM_400_2000	Maybe Pawniard will show up if one of us climbs on it.
A1_2080_PIKACHU_400_2000	Worth a shot. Let’s give it a try.
A1_2080_PIKACHU_400_3000	How’s this?
A1_2080_TIM_400_3000	I just hope it’s actually here to see this...
A1_2080_SECRETKOMATANA_400_1000	Paaawn!
A1_2080_PIKACHU_400_4000	Wha—?!
A1_2080_TIM_500_1000	Why don’t we try waiting for a while to see if it\nshows up?
A1_2080_PIKACHU_500_1000	A good old-fashioned stakeout, huh? Hope it doesn’t\nturn out to be a waste of time...
A1_2080_PIKACHU_500_2000	Hey, Tim. How long do we gotta wait?
A1_2080_TIM_500_2000	It sure doesn’t seem to be coming...
A1_2080_PIKACHU_500_3000	It’s not gonna show up just ’cause we’re waiting for it.\nAt this rate, we’ll be here till sundown!
A1_2080_TIM_500_3000	Don’t say that! We came up with this plan together,\nremember?
A1_20805_GARDIE_100_1000	(Hey, Pikachu! Over there!)
A1_20805_PIKACHU_100_1000	Could that be...?
A1_20815_UU_100_1000	*yawn*
A1_20815_GARDIE_100_1000	(Yes, it’s Cramorant!)
A1_20815_PIKACHU_100_1000	Must be feelin’ pretty carefree to fall asleep\nin a place like this...
A1_20815_GARDIE_100_2000	(We’ve been looking for you, Cramorant!)
A1_20815_UU_100_2000	(Wha—? Oh, heeey! It’s Growlithe! Whatcha doin’\nhere?)
A1_20815_GARDIE_100_3000	(That’s what I’d like to ask you!)
A1_20815_UU_100_3000	(Hmmm? Wait, what’s goin’ on?)
A1_20815_PIKACHU_100_2000	Sorry to bother you when you just woke up, but do\nyou think you could answer some questions?
A1_20815_UU_100_4000	(Who are you?)
A1_20815_PIKACHU_100_3000	No need to be scared—I’m the great Detective\nPikachu, and I’m here to help you!
A1_20815_UU_100_5000	(Great de-whatsit pika-who?)
A1_20815_GARDIE_100_4000	(Pikachu is my friend, and he has some questions for\nyou, Cramorant.)
A1_20815_UU_100_6000	(Uhhh, still dunno what’s going on, but suuure...)
A1_20820_UU_100_1000	(What’d you wanna ask me, duuude?)
A1_20820_SEL_0_1000	About you, Cramorant...
A1_20820_SEL_0_2000	About Turner...
A1_20820_SEL_0_3000	Why are you here?
A1_20820_SEL_0_4000	At the time of the incident...
A1_20820_PIKACHU_300_1000	Are you Turner’s partner, Cramorant?
A1_20820_UU_300_1000	(Sure am, duuude. What about it?)
A1_20820_GARDIE_300_1000	(We were worried about you because you weren’t\nat home.)
A1_20820_UU_300_2000	(Really? My bad.)
A1_20820_PIKACHU_400_1000	Can you tell me about Turner?
A1_20820_UU_400_1000	(Turner’s my partner. He’s a good dude, duuude.\nMe and him go waaay back.)
A1_20820_GARDIE_400_1000	(Cramorant is always helping Turner out with his\nduties at the house.)
A1_20820_UU_400_2000	(If Turner calls for me, I head riiight over, no matter\nwhere he is.)
A1_20820_UU_400_3000	(I even go shopping with him, duuude. If he needs\nsomething carried, I just swallow it whole.)
A1_20820_PIKACHU_400_2000	Wait, you swallow it? Is that safe for...anyone?
A1_20820_UU_400_4000	(It’s fine, duuude. Just rub my back, and I’ll hork up\nwhatever’s fillin’ my tum, lickety-split.)
A1_20820_PIKACHU_400_3000	Blegh, more like lickety-SPIT...
A1_20820_PIKACHU_400_4000	But I guess Cramorant are kinda built for that, huh.
A1_20820_PIKACHU_500_1000	Why were you sleeping out here of all places?
A1_20820_UU_500_1000	<color=#F39800FF>(’Cause I got reaaal sleepy after I ate breakfast.)</color>
A1_20820_GARDIE_500_1000	(Hey, me too!)
A1_20820_UU_500_2000	(Whoooa, really?!)
A1_20820_PIKACHU_500_2000	Hmm... So Ducklett and the others ALL fell asleep...
A1_20820_UU_500_3000	(After thaaat, Turner woke me up, and I flew right\noutta the house.)
A1_20820_PIKACHU_500_3000	Why did he wake you up?
A1_20820_UU_500_4000	(Uhhh, becauuuse... What was it again? He said to go\nto the back alley...I thiiink?)
A1_20820_PIKACHU_500_4000	You don’t even remember THAT? Yeesh. What a guy.
A1_20820_UU_500_5000	(I kinda fell asleep a few times on my way here, too...\nBut in the end, I made it.)
A1_20820_UU_500_6000	(I was sooo sleepy, but right when I was about to\nzonk out, I found this choice bed.)
A1_20820_UU_500_7000	(So I took a nap, duuude.)
A1_20820_YABUKURON_500_1000	(He’s talking about me, by the way.)
A1_20820_GARDIE_500_2000	(You thought Trubbish was a bed?!)
A1_20820_UU_500_8000	(Yeaaah! Dude’s, like, suuuper squishy.)
A1_20820_PIKACHU_500_5000	This guy’s something else...
A1_20820_GARDIE_500_3000	(If you wanted to sleep, wouldn’t it make more sense\nto go home first?)
A1_20820_GARDIE_500_4000	(I’m sure Turner’s worried about you.)
A1_20820_UU_500_9000	(*gasp* Turner!)
A1_20820_UU_500_10000	(That’s right! I gotta get back to Turner!)
A1_20820_PIKACHU_500_6000	Any particular reason?
A1_20820_UU_500_11000	(’Cause he’s my partner, duuude!)
A1_20820_UU_500_12000	(Or, waaait... Did he say NOT to go back? Which\nwas it again?)
A1_20820_PIKACHU_500_7000	Hey, don’t look at me.
A1_20820_GARDIE_500_5000	(I really think you should get back. Turner must be\nworried about you.)
A1_20820_PIKACHU_600_1000	I’d like to hear about what Cramorant was doing at\nthe time the incident occurred.
A1_20820_PIKACHU_600_2000	You said you ate breakfast and got sleepy, right?
A1_20820_UU_600_1000	(Yuuup.)
A1_20820_PIKACHU_600_3000	You must’ve eaten a lot.
A1_20820_UU_600_2000	(Same as uzhe, actually. But even now, my tum is\nsooo stuffed, duuude.)
A1_20820_PIKACHU_600_4000	Wasn’t breakfast a while ago? Why are you still\nso full?
A1_20820_UU_600_3000	(I’m not sure, duuude.)
A1_20820_UU_600_4000	<color=#F39800FF>(My tum feels the same as when I swallow\nsomething biiig.)</color>
A1_20820_PIKACHU_600_5000	Something big, huh?
A1_20820_PIKACHU_600_6000	Interesting...
A1_20821_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, we heard from Cramorant, but his answers\nweren’t very clear.
A1_20821_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s try talking to Trubbish.
A1_20821_YABUKURON_100_1000	(Huh? Me?)
A1_20823_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, where are you goin’, Growlithe?
A1_20823_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s try talkin’ to Trubbish!
A1_20825_YABUKURON_100_1000	(Did...did you need something from me?)
A1_20825_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’re investigating a crime. Do you mind if we ask\nyou a few questions?
A1_20825_YABUKURON_100_2000	(A crime? I’m sure I don’t know anything about that...)
A1_20825_PIKACHU_100_2000	That’s fine. You’re not in any trouble—we’re just trying\nto gather all the information we can.
A1_20825_GARDIE_100_1000	(Will you help us, please?)
A1_20830_YABUKURON_100_1000	(I guess I could answer a few questions...)
A1_20830_SEL_0_1000	About you, Trubbish...
A1_20830_SEL_0_2000	What are you doing here?
A1_20830_SEL_0_3000	About the trash...
A1_20830_PIKACHU_300_1000	Could you tell me a bit about yourself?
A1_20830_YABUKURON_300_1000	(Sure, but there’s not much to say.)
A1_20830_PIKACHU_300_2000	All right. Then have you noticed anything strange\nrecently?
A1_20830_YABUKURON_300_2000	(Strange?)
A1_20830_YABUKURON_300_3000	(Well, I’ve just been gathering trash from around the\ncity, like I do every day.)
A1_20830_GARDIE_300_1000	(You do that every day?! Wow, thank you!)
A1_20830_YABUKURON_300_4000	(It’s just my routine.)
A1_20830_YABUKURON_300_5000	(I guess I did collect some unusual trash today...\nDoes that count as “strange“?)
A1_20830_GARDIE_300_2000	(What was so unusual about it?)
A1_20830_YABUKURON_300_6000	(It was stuck to a Whimsicott’s head. They were in\nfront of a big house when I found it.)
A1_20830_PIKACHU_300_3000	A Whimsicott getting stuff stuck to its head doesn’t\nsound all that unusual to me...
A1_20830_GARDIE_300_3000	(Pikachu! You can’t say things like that!)
A1_20830_GARDIE_300_4000	(Trash is important to Trubbish! Don’t call it “stuff”!)
A1_20830_PIKACHU_400_1000	What brings you here?
A1_20830_YABUKURON_400_1000	(Well, I’m not great around humans...)
A1_20830_YABUKURON_400_2000	(And humans don’t usually come here, so it seemed\nlike a safe place.)
A1_20830_GARDIE_400_1000	(Did they do something mean to you?)
A1_20830_YABUKURON_400_3000	(No... I just don’t like too much noise.)
A1_20830_YABUKURON_400_4000	(And humans are so noisy. Don’t you think?)
A1_20830_GARDIE_400_2000	(Uh... I guess?)
A1_20830_YABUKURON_400_5000	(Anyway... This place is nice and quiet.)
A1_20830_PIKACHU_500_1000	Do you still have the trash that was stuck\nto Whimsicott?
A1_20830_YABUKURON_500_1000	(Yeah. I was saving it for a snack.)
A1_20830_YABUKURON_500_2000	(Why? Did you want it?)
A1_20830_PIKACHU_500_2000	I’d like to at least have a look at it. Could you show\nit to us?
A1_20830_YABUKURON_500_3000	(Sure, I guess...)
A1_20830_PIKACHU_500_3000	It’s pretty crumpled up, but it looks like a note.
A1_20830_GARDIE_500_1000	(*sniff sniff* Hey, it smells like the rooms in our\nhouse!)
A1_20830_PIKACHU_500_4000	You mean Denis’s mansion? Hmm, that’s interesting.\nLemme see...
A1_20830_PIKACHU_500_5000	“Open the window after Barnes leaves. That will be\nthe signal.
A1_20830_PIKACHU_500_6000	“Once the window is open, I’ll send Pawniard in with\nWhimsicott to cut the case.
A1_20830_PIKACHU_500_7000	“You should then be able to collect the jewel.
A1_20830_PIKACHU_500_8000	“If you play your part properly, you should be able to\nframe Barnes for everything.
A1_20830_PIKACHU_500_9000	“And if you’re successful, we’ll both be coming into\nquite a lot of money. Good luck.”
A1_20830_PIKACHU_500_10000	This is a note from the culprit!
A1_20830_GARDIE_500_2000	(Whaaa—?!)
A1_20830_PIKACHU_500_11000	So the thief had an accomplice, huh? That must be\nwhy there were multiple Pokémon involved...
A1_20830_PIKACHU_500_12000	Whatever the case, <color=#F39800FF>this is definitely a big clue</color>!
A1_20830_GARDIE_500_3000	(This is great, Pikachu!)
A1_20830_PIKACHU_500_13000	Sorry about this, Trubbish, but do you think we can\nhave this piece of trash? Please?
A1_20830_YABUKURON_500_4000	(Umm... I guess if you want it that badly, sure.)
A1_20830_PIKACHU_500_14000	Thanks! I’ll be sure to make it up to ya later.
A1_20840_PIKACHU_100_1000	I guess we managed to ask everything we wanted to.
A1_20840_GARDIE_100_1000	(Shall we head back home?)
A1_20840_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah. We got a good clue, so let’s go meet up with\nTim again.
A1_20840_GARDIE_100_2000	(Got it!)
A1_20840_PIKACHU_100_3000	What are you gonna do, Cramorant? Wanna come\nback to the mansion with us?
A1_20840_UU_100_1000	(Naaah, I’m good. I’ll head back at my own pace.)
A1_20840_UU_100_2000	(My tum feels, like, waaay heavy from that breakfast\nI ate.)
A1_20840_GARDIE_100_3000	(Poor Cramorant looks pretty uncomfortable...)
A1_20840_PIKACHU_100_4000	OK. You just rest here for a while, then.
A1_20840_PIKACHU_100_5000	Once you feel like you can move again, come on\nback to the mansion.
A1_20840_UU_100_3000	(Oookaaay.)
A1_20840_PIKACHU_100_6000	All right, let’s head back, Growlithe!
A1_20840_GARDIE_100_4000	(Yes!)
A1_20910_PABLO_100_1000	Hm? Did you come here for some coffee by yourself?
A1_20910_PIKACHU_100_1000	Sorry, but I’m in the middle of an investigation. I’ll be\nback for a cup once we’ve cracked the case.
A1_20910_PABLO_100_2000	Heh! Guess you’re not here for a drink.
A1_20910_PABLO_100_3000	Well, you’re welcome anytime!
A1_20920_RUNPAPPA_100_1000	(La la laaa! ♪ Welcome! We’ve got the best coffee\naround, brewed just for you!)
A1_20920_PIKACHU_100_1000	I love your energy, Ludicolo. You’re always so\ncheerful!
A1_20920_RUNPAPPA_100_2000	(Come on, let’s all sing together! La la laaa! ♪)
A1_20920_GARDIE_100_1000	(La la laaa! ♪)
A1_20925_RUNPAPPA_100_1000	(La la la! ♪ Welcome! We’ve got the best coffee\naround, brewed just for you!)
A1_20925_PIKACHU_100_1000	Ludicolo’s always so cheerful!
A1_20930_JESSICA_100_1000	Wow, a Pikachu riding a Growlithe? You don’t see\nthat every day.
A1_20930_JESSICA_100_2000	You two must really trust each other.
A1_20930_GARDIE_100_1000	(I think that person is talking to us.)
A1_20930_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, apparently we look like we’re having fun.
A1_20940_RACHEL_100_1000	Hm? You’re not with Tim?
A1_20940_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’re investigating separately right now.
A1_20940_GARDIE_100_1000	(I’m Pikachu’s partner for the moment!)
A1_2100_TIM_100_1000	It’s Pawniard!
A1_2100_PIKACHU_100_1000	Just like Whimsicott said!
A1_2100_KOMATANA_100_1000	Pawn! Paw pawn!
A1_2100_PIKACHU_100_2000	OK, it’s saying, “Darest thou tread upon my\ncherished rock? What is the meaning of this?!”
A1_2100_PIKACHU_100_3000	“Thine answer shall determine thy fate—I will show\nthee no mercy!” ...Wait, what?!
A1_2100_TIM_100_2000	Wow, it’s really angry...
A1_2100_PIKACHU_100_4000	Sorry, we just wanted to find you. We weren’t trying\nto mess with your rock or anything.
A1_2100_KOMATANA_100_2000	Pawn.
A1_2100_PIKACHU_100_5000	Phew! Thank goodness... It said it’ll forgive us, but\njust this once.
A1_2100_KOMATANA_100_3000	Pawn?
A1_2100_PIKACHU_100_6000	You wanna know why we were looking for you?
A1_2100_PIKACHU_100_7000	Fair enough.
A1_2100_PIKACHU_100_8000	We’ve got some questions we’d like to ask you.
A1_2100_TIM_100_3000	Would you mind talking with us for a bit?
A1_2100_KOMATANA_100_4000	Pawn.
A1_2100_PIKACHU_100_9000	It says it’ll talk.
A1_2100_TIM_200_1000	Can we ask you some questions?
A1_2100_KOMATANA_200_1000	Pawn.
A1_2100_SEL_0_1000	About you, Pawniard...
A1_2100_SEL_0_2000	About the Denis residence...
A1_2100_SEL_0_3000	About Ducklett...
A1_2100_KOMATANA_300_1000	Pawn.
A1_2100_PIKACHU_300_1000	So you’ve been traveling all over as part of your\njourney to warriorhood?
A1_2100_TIM_300_1000	I’m sorry, did you say “journey to warriorhood”?
A1_2100_PIKACHU_300_2000	Apparently it travels all over the place to practice\nand improve its moves.
A1_2100_KOMATANA_300_2000	Pawn!
A1_2100_PIKACHU_300_3000	It says that because it was born with these blades,\nit wishes nothing more than to master them.
A1_2100_TIM_300_2000	If Pawniard is that proud of its blades, I bet they have\nrazor-sharp edges.
A1_2100_KOMATANA_300_3000	Pawn!
A1_2100_PIKACHU_300_4000	It says it can easily slice a rock in two.
A1_2100_PIKACHU_300_5000	This might sound a bit...strange, but you haven’t,\nuh, punched anyone recently, have you?
A1_2100_KOMATANA_300_4000	Pawn.
A1_2100_PIKACHU_300_6000	Pawniard says it’s never “punched” a single person or\nPokémon in its life.
A1_2100_KOMATANA_300_5000	Pawn.
A1_2100_PIKACHU_300_7000	Good point. You could cut something with those\nhands of yours, but you definitely couldn’t punch it.
A1_2100_TIM_300_3000	Yeah, on second thought, you’d wind up with a\ndifferent injury if you were punched by a Pawniard...
A1_2100_PIKACHU_300_8000	Are there any other Pawniard in this city besides you?
A1_2100_KOMATANA_300_6000	Pawn.
A1_2100_TIM_300_4000	What’s it saying?
A1_2100_PIKACHU_300_9000	Apparently it’s never seen any other Pawniard.
A1_2100_TIM_400_1000	We heard from some Whimsicott that they went to\nMr. Denis’s mansion.
A1_2100_TIM_400_2000	Were you the one who went there with them?
A1_2100_KOMATANA_400_1000	Pawn...
A1_2100_PIKACHU_400_1000	Pawniard’s not sure if it was the same place, but...
A1_2100_PIKACHU_400_2000	it vaguely remembers going to a big house.
A1_2100_KOMATANA_400_2000	Pawn...
A1_2100_PIKACHU_400_3000	It says it entered the house together with the\nWhimsicott.
A1_2100_TIM_400_3000	How did you get inside the mansion?
A1_2100_PIKACHU_400_4000	Apparently, Pawniard likes to get picked up and flown\naround by Whimsicott.
A1_2100_PIKACHU_400_5000	So you think you might’ve gotten inside the mansion\nthat way?
A1_2100_TIM_400_4000	Did you happen to cut a jewel case when you were in\nthat mansion?
A1_2100_KOMATANA_400_3000	Pawn...
A1_2100_PIKACHU_400_6000	So you can remember the sensation of cutting through\nsomething, but the rest is a blur?
A1_2100_PIKACHU_400_7000	This is important, so please, try to remember!
A1_2100_KOMATANA_400_4000	Pawn...
A1_2100_PIKACHU_400_8000	It says its mind feels all foggy, and it just can’t\nremember what was going on at the time.
A1_2100_TIM_400_5000	That sure makes things difficult.
A1_2100_KOMATANA_400_5000	Pawn.
A1_2100_TIM_500_1000	Have you seen Ducklett around anywhere?
A1_2100_KOMATANA_500_1000	Pawn.
A1_2100_PIKACHU_500_1000	It hasn’t seen her.
A1_2100_TIM_500_2000	Great... Where could Ducklett have gone?
A1_21010_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’re back, Tim.
A1_21010_TIM_100_1000	Thanks, both of you.
A1_21010_TIM_100_2000	Are you getting down off of Growlithe now, Pikachu?
A1_21010_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_21010_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_21010_GARDIE_300_1000	(Can you get down on your own?)
A1_21010_PIKACHU_300_1000	Psh, please. Who do you think I am? I can handle\nthis... *gulp*
A1_21010_GARDIE_400_1000	(You mean you want to keep investigating? OK!\nLet’s both do everything we can!)
A1_21010_PIKACHU_400_1000	That’s the spirit, Growlithe!
A1_21015_PIKACHU_100_1000	What’s this bowl?
A1_21015_GARDIE_100_1000	(That’s the dish I eat my meals from.)
A1_21020_PIKACHU_100_1000	Need to check the sleep powder’s scent again?
A1_21020_GARDIE_100_1000	(I might as well.)
A1_2110_TIM_100_1000	We finally managed to find Pawniard, but we weren’t\nable to learn anything useful from it.
A1_2110_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, and some of what it said even contradicted\ntestimony we gathered earlier.
A1_2110_PIKACHU_100_2000	Maybe we could get more information if we had\nproof that Pawniard entered the mansion...
A1_2110_KOMATANA_100_1000	Pawn?
A1_2110_PIKACHU_100_3000	It’s asking if we’re done here so it can get back\nto training.
A1_2110_TIM_100_2000	What sort of training does it do?
A1_2110_KOMATANA_100_2000	Pawn.
A1_2110_PIKACHU_100_4000	It’s planning on cutting rocks and things to sharpen its\nskills and blades.
A1_2110_TIM_100_3000	Cut...rocks? Wow, would it be willing to demonstrate\nfor us?
A1_2110_PIKACHU_100_5000	Oooh, good idea! It would be a big help to see what\na cut from a Pawniard looks like!
A1_2110_KOMATANA_100_3000	Pawn.
A1_2110_PIKACHU_100_6000	Yeah, it says it would happily “grace us with a\ndemonstration.”
A1_2110_TIM_100_4000	Thank you! We’ll watch quietly so you can focus.
A1_21110_GARDIE_100_1000	(Oh no, Pikachu. The scent stops here! What do we\ndo now?)
A1_21110_PIKACHU_100_1000	There must be something around here. Let’s look\naround the terrace.
A1_21110_GARDIE_100_2000	(Sure.)
A1_21210_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, you still haven’t made it back to the mansion?
A1_21210_UU_100_1000	(I’m just resting ’cause my tum feels sooo stuffed.)
A1_21210_PIKACHU_200_1000	I’m pretty sure this Cramorant is the key to solving\nthis mystery...
A1_21210_PIKACHU_200_2000	Maybe if I talk it over with Tim, it’ll spark a bolt\nof brilliance.
A1_21210_PIKACHU_200_3000	I think I should go back to Tim for now.
A1_2130_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hmm... This clean slice, and the metallic sound\nPawniard’s blade made when it made contact...
A1_2130_PIKACHU_100_2000	It all matches with what we know of the crime scene.
A1_2130_TIM_100_1000	That means the Pokémon that entered the mansion\nmust have been Pawniard.
A1_2130_PIKACHU_100_3000	But neither Whimsicott nor Pawniard remembers\nclearly. What’s up with that?
A1_2130_TIM_100_2000	I can’t imagine that the Pokémon are lying...
A1_2130_PIKACHU_100_4000	Their behavior was pretty unusual, but there must be\na good reason for it...
A1_21310_TIM_100_1000	Are you done investigating with Growlithe?
A1_21310_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_21310_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_21310_PIKACHU_300_1000	Yeah, that’s enough.
A1_21310_PIKACHU_300_2000	Thank you, Growlithe!
A1_21310_PIKACHU_400_1000	Give us just a little more time.
A1_2140_TIM_100_1000	I don’t think we’ll figure out what’s wrong with their\nmemories until we investigate a bit more.
A1_2140_PIKACHU_100_1000	Right. Let’s do what we can right now.
A1_2140_TIM_100_2000	We should consider looking for Ducklett now that\nwe’ve found Pawniard.
A1_2140_PIKACHU_100_2000	Barnes said he asked her to pick up some coffee\nbeans today, didn’t he?
A1_2140_TIM_100_3000	Yeah. Maybe someone at the Hi-Hat Café saw\nDucklett there.
A1_2140_PIKACHU_100_3000	Now that you mention it, we never managed to go\nthere ourselves after Holiday showed up.
A1_2150_TIM_100_1000	We’ve looked all over the place, but we haven’t seen\nDucklett anywhere...
A1_2150_PIKACHU_100_1000	Apparently she almost got caught earlier, but then\nran away.
A1_2150_PIKACHU_100_2000	So maybe she’s hiding somewhere.
A1_2150_TIM_100_2000	Then how are we going to find her?
A1_2210_DCPOLICEWOMAN02_100_1000	Thank you for coming to help! Take care out there!
A1_2210_TIM_100_1000	Thank you.
A1_2230_TIM_100_1000	What are you up to?
A1_2230_MIRUHOG_100_1000	Chog.
A1_2230_PIKACHU_100_1000	Watchog’s hobby is observing things around the city.
A1_2230_TIM_100_2000	In that case, maybe it’s seen something useful!
A1_2230_PIKACHU_100_2000	Can’t hurt to ask!
A1_2230_MIRUHOG_200_1000	Chog.
A1_2230_TIM_200_1000	Let’s ask what it’s seen recently.
A1_2230_SEL_0_1000	About you, Watchog...
A1_2230_SEL_0_2000	About Ducklett...
A1_2230_SEL_0_3000	About the red Pokémon...
A1_2230_MIRUHOG_300_1000	Chog.
A1_2230_PIKACHU_300_1000	Oh, you never get bored in this city ’cause there are\nso many different people and Pokémon to watch?
A1_2230_PIKACHU_300_2000	Must be fun having eyes like yours—especially since\nthey let you see in the dark!
A1_2230_MIRUHOG_400_1000	Watcho!
A1_2230_PIKACHU_400_1000	What, really?
A1_2230_MIRUHOG_400_2000	Chog!
A1_2230_TIM_400_1000	What’s it saying? You’ve gotta tell me too!
A1_2230_PIKACHU_400_2000	Right, sorry. It says it saw Ducklett pass by here.
A1_2230_TIM_400_2000	If she passed by here, she was probably on her way to\nthe café after all.
A1_2230_MIRUHOG_500_1000	Chog.
A1_2230_PIKACHU_500_1000	There are so many red Pokémon, you don’t know\nwhich one we mean?
A1_2230_TIM_500_1000	Good point. Do we know anything else about it?
A1_2230_PIKACHU_500_2000	Hmm... Let’s see...
A1_2230_PIKACHU_500_3000	We know it’s a Pokémon that can use a move to slice\nclean through hard objects, and that can easily knock\ndown a human with a punch!
A1_2230_MIRUHOG_500_2000	Watcho?
A1_2230_PIKACHU_500_4000	You haven’t seen any Pokémon like that around here?
A1_2230_PIKACHU_500_5000	All right, then...
A1_2240_PIKACHU_100_1000	We don’t have any reason to go that way, do we?\nLet’s investigate this area a little more.
A1_2280_RACHEL_100_1000	Wow! What a coincidence, running into you here!
A1_2280_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, I’m as surprised as you are!
A1_2280_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hmm, I think I’ve seen this girl somewhere before.
A1_2280_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh, I remember—Howard’s notebook! She’s the girl\nfrom the photo!
A1_2280_TIM_100_2000	Yes, Pikachu. This is Rachel. We go to college\ntogether? She’s the mayor’s daughter...?
A1_2280_PIKACHU_100_3000	Right, right. And you said she knows a lot about\nPokémon, too, didn’t you?
A1_2280_PIKACHU_100_4000	And she’s JUST a classmate, or...?
A1_2280_TIM_100_3000	See, this is why I don’t like telling you about my\npersonal life.
A1_2280_PIKACHU_100_5000	I’m just lookin’ out for ya—I never hear you talk about\nactually having fun with people!
A1_2280_PIKACHU_100_6000	Ah, well. Anyway, who’s the woman next to her?
A1_2280_TIM_100_4000	I know about as much as you do—I don’t think we’ve\nmet before.
A1_2280_RACHEL_100_2000	Hey, Jessica, have you heard of these—?
A1_2280_JESSICA_100_1000	Of course! It’s an honor to meet the great detectives!
A1_2280_RACHEL_100_3000	By the way, Tim... Were you talking to Pikachu\njust now?
A1_2280_TIM_100_5000	Wh-what? No way!
A1_2280_RACHEL_100_4000	Aww, no need to be embarrassed. I totally understand\nthe urge to talk with your partner.
A1_2280_RACHEL_100_5000	But now that you’re here, why don’t you chat with us\nfor a bit?
A1_2280_TIM_100_6000	Uh, yeah. Sure.
A1_2290_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, where are you going?
A1_2290_TIM_300_1000	Oh, right, we haven’t asked Pablo about Ducklett.
A1_2290_PIKACHU_300_1000	Yeah, that’s what we came all the way out here for, so\nlet’s get to it!
A1_2290_PIKACHU_400_1000	We sure got some good information about Ducklett\nfrom Pablo just now.
A1_2290_PIKACHU_400_2000	Why don’t we organize all our information in your\ncase notebook?
A1_2290_PIKACHU_500_1000	Don’t you want to talk to your friends?
A1_2290_PIKACHU_600_1000	We made it all the way out to the café, so we may as\nwell talk to everyone while we’re here.
A1_2290_PIKACHU_600_2000	And I certainly wouldn’t mind having a cup of coffee\nwhile we’re at it!
A1_2300_PIKACHU_100_1000	Come on, Tim. You can give me a better compliment\nthan that!
A1_2300_RACHEL_100_1000	You seem different from usual somehow.
A1_2300_RACHEL_100_2000	Don’t tell me that award my dad gave you is already\nstarting to change you.
A1_2300_TIM_100_1000	No, of course not—I’m the same as I’ve always been.
A1_2300_RACHEL_100_3000	Are you sure?
A1_2300_TIM_100_2000	I mean, we don’t really know each other all that well.\nMaybe you have the wrong impression of me?
A1_2300_RACHEL_100_4000	No way! I’ve had my eye on you for a while\nnow, Tim...
A1_2300_TIM_100_3000	E-excuse me?!
A1_2300_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh?! Does she mean what I think she means?!
A1_2300_RACHEL_100_5000	It’s like I have a front-row seat to the great detective\nin action!
A1_2300_RACHEL_100_6000	It feels like an exciting new adventure could break\nout at any moment!
A1_2300_TIM_100_4000	Ahh...right.
A1_2300_PIKACHU_100_3000	Did you get your hopes up for a moment there, Tim?
A1_2300_TIM_100_5000	Quiet, you.
A1_2300_RACHEL_200_1000	Good luck with your work!
A1_2300_TIM_200_1000	Thanks, Rachel.
A1_2310_JESSICA_100_1000	I see news about your accomplishments on TV all the\ntime! You’re quite the celebrity.
A1_2310_TIM_100_1000	Celebrity? I wouldn’t go quite that far...
A1_2310_JESSICA_100_2000	No need to be modest—you’re a great detective,\nafter all!
A1_2310_RACHEL_100_1000	Jessica used to work with my mother years ago.
A1_2310_RACHEL_100_2000	That’s how we met, and we’ve been friends ever since.
A1_2310_TIM_100_2000	Oh, I see.
A1_2310_RACHEL_100_3000	But it’s been a while since we’ve met up like this.
A1_2310_JESSICA_100_3000	About two years, I think? We’ve both been so busy\nlately, there just hasn’t been time to get together.
A1_2310_JESSICA_100_4000	I had no idea you’d become friends with the famous\ngreat detective!
A1_2310_RACHEL_100_4000	Were you surprised?
A1_2310_JESSICA_100_5000	Yes, of course!
A1_2310_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, I’M the great detective!
A1_2310_JESSICA_100_6000	By the way, Tim...
A1_2310_JESSICA_100_7000	I work at a pizzeria in Bamboo Borough.
A1_2310_JESSICA_100_8000	If you’re ever in the area, stop by! I’ll treat you to one\nof our awesome pizzas!
A1_2310_RACHEL_100_5000	All right! Did you hear that, Tim? Let’s go sometime!
A1_2310_RACHEL_100_6000	The pizza place where Jessica works is actually\npretty famous!
A1_2310_TIM_100_3000	Sounds great! I’d love to go.
A1_2310_TIM_100_4000	I’ll take you up on that offer!
A1_2310_JESSICA_100_9000	I’ll be waiting!
A1_2310_JESSICA_200_1000	I’ll be cheering you on, Tim!
A1_2310_TIM_200_1000	Thank you.
A1_2320_RACHEL_100_1000	Tim... There’s actually something I wanted to talk to\nyou about.
A1_2320_TIM_100_1000	What’s up?
A1_2320_RACHEL_100_2000	Well, it’s about something going on at home...
A1_2320_PIKACHU_100_1000	Sounds serious.
A1_2320_TIM_100_2000	I’m not sure how much help I’ll be, but you can always\ntalk to me.
A1_2320_RACHEL_100_3000	I don’t want to waste your time, though...
A1_2320_TIM_100_3000	Don’t worry about it. I’m working right now, but we\ncould meet up tonight if you’re free.
A1_2320_RACHEL_100_4000	Sure, that works. Thank you, Tim.
A1_2320_TIM_100_4000	OK, then how about you stop by my apartment later\nthis evening?
A1_2320_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hey, not bad, Tim!
A1_2320_PIKACHU_100_3000	But aren’t we supposed to have dinner with your\nfamily tonight?
A1_2320_TIM_100_5000	Yeah, but this sounds serious. I can’t just brush her off.
A1_2320_TIM_100_6000	The least I can do is hear her out for a little bit.
A1_2320_PIKACHU_100_4000	Fair enough.
A1_2320_PIKACHU_100_5000	I’m sure your family will understand.
A1_2330_PABLO_100_1000	Hi, Tim! Did something happen today? I noticed you\nweren’t here this morning!
A1_2330_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, I got caught up in a new case.
A1_2330_PABLO_100_2000	Oh, sounds rough.
A1_2330_TIM_100_2000	Do you mind if I ask you some questions?
A1_2330_PABLO_100_3000	Me? Sure, go right ahead.
A1_2330_TIM_200_1000	Do you have a bit more time to speak?
A1_2330_PABLO_200_1000	Yeah, sure, ask anything you want!
A1_2330_SEL_0_1000	About the Hi-Hat Café...
A1_2330_SEL_0_2000	About Barnes...
A1_2330_SEL_0_3000	Stressed?
A1_2330_SEL_0_4000	About Ducklett...
A1_2330_TIM_300_1000	You must’ve been really busy moving your café to this\nnew location. Do you feel all settled in now?
A1_2330_PABLO_300_1000	Yeah, feels like things are finally back to normal.
A1_2330_TIM_300_2000	I know Pikachu’s been coming here on his own to\ndrink your coffee...
A1_2330_TIM_300_3000	I hope he hasn’t been causing you any trouble.
A1_2330_PIKACHU_300_1000	Trouble? Me?! I’m a paying customer!\n...Once you pick up my tab.
A1_2330_PABLO_300_2000	Not at all. The café’s way closer to your place now,\nand it seems like Pikachu feels comfortable here.
A1_2330_PABLO_300_3000	And the Hi-Hat Café always welcomes Pokémon\ncustomers!
A1_2330_PABLO_400_1000	The butler from the Denis mansion? Yeah, he swings\nby the café pretty often after he’s done with work.
A1_2330_TIM_400_1000	Barnes is a regular customer?
A1_2330_PABLO_400_2000	Yeah! He loves coffee and jazz, so we’ve got plenty to\ntalk about.
A1_2330_PABLO_400_3000	But apparently he’s been really stressed lately, so he\nhasn’t been stopping by as much.
A1_2330_TIM_400_2000	He’s been really stressed, huh?
A1_2330_PIKACHU_400_1000	You should probably ask for more details about that.
A1_2330_TIM_500_1000	Do you know why Barnes was stressed? Was he\nworried about something?
A1_2330_PABLO_500_1000	Oh, uh, well...
A1_2330_PABLO_500_2000	I’m not sure it’s my place to tell you about a\ncustomer’s personal matters...
A1_2330_TIM_500_2000	Please, we’re just trying to help. It’s for Barnes’s sake.
A1_2330_PABLO_500_3000	Ah, so this is for a case, huh?
A1_2330_PABLO_500_4000	Then I guess I’d better tell you.
A1_2330_PABLO_500_5000	He was worried about the jewel that Mr. Denis was\nplanning to donate to Ryme City.
A1_2330_PABLO_500_6000	Apparently the Denises had a difference of opinion\nabout that.
A1_2330_PABLO_500_7000	Barnes was trying to come up with a compromise\nthat would satisfy both of them.
A1_2330_PABLO_500_8000	But he said he just wound up getting stuck in the\nmiddle of the argument.
A1_2330_TIM_500_3000	That does sound stressful...
A1_2330_PABLO_500_9000	I remember him saying he wished there was no jewel\nin the first place.
A1_2330_PIKACHU_500_1000	He wished there was no jewel, huh?
A1_2330_PABLO_500_10000	Anyway, that’s all I know. I hope it helps!
A1_2330_TIM_500_4000	Yes, thank you.
A1_2330_TIM_600_1000	Do you know the Ducklett that lives at the Denis\nresidence?
A1_2330_PABLO_600_1000	Yeah, I know her! You’re talking about Barnes’s\npartner, right?
A1_2330_PABLO_600_2000	She often comes here all on her own to buy\ncoffee beans.
A1_2330_PABLO_600_3000	She really is a clever little Pokémon.
A1_2330_PIKACHU_600_1000	Just like Barnes said.
A1_2330_PABLO_600_4000	She always comes with this cute little bag that I fill\nwith beans for her.
A1_2330_PABLO_600_5000	As far as I know, she takes them straight back to\nthe mansion.
A1_2330_PABLO_600_6000	<color=#F39800FF>In fact, she left with her usual order a couple\nminutes ago!</color>

A1_2350_TIM_400_2000	I guess Water-type Pokémon get along swimmingly\nwith each other.
A1_2360_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s head back to the mansion to search for Ducklett.
A1_2360_TIM_100_1000	Good idea.
A1_2370_BRAD_100_1000	What in the world were you doing?
A1_2370_DCPOLICEWOMAN02_100_1000	My apologies, sir!
A1_2370_TIM_100_1000	Did something happen, Brad?
A1_2370_BRAD_100_2000	Ducklett was spotted near the mansion just now.
A1_2370_BRAD_100_3000	But when my subordinates tried to catch her, they let\nher escape.
A1_2370_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, so Ducklett had just gotten back to the mansion.
A1_2370_TIM_100_2000	Do you know where she ran off to?
A1_2370_BRAD_100_4000	Unfortunately I do not. And I don’t have the resources\nto keep searching.
A1_2370_BRAD_100_5000	At this point, I’ll have to call in the services of the\nPokémon Protection Bureau...
A1_2370_BRAD_100_6000	You. Tell the inspector that I’m heading back to the\nstation for a moment.
A1_2370_DCPOLICEWOMAN02_100_2000	Yes, sir!
A1_2370_TIM_100_3000	Well, Brad and Manectric are gone.
A1_2370_PIKACHU_100_2000	But still, we have no idea where Ducklett could have\nrun off to...
A1_2370_PIKACHU_100_3000	Where would we even start looking...
A1_2380_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, now what?
A1_2380_TIM_100_1000	Should we put the search for Ducklett on hold and\nlook for the red Pokémon instead?
A1_2380_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, sure. That’s better than just spinning our wheels.
A1_2380_TIM_100_2000	There are still places we haven’t looked. Let’s check\n’em out.
A1_2390_DCPOLICEWOMAN02_100_1000	I’ll catch her next time!
A1_2510_CLAUDIA_100_1000	Oh, it’s you. Isn’t your investigation finished already?
A1_2510_TIM_100_1000	I’m sorry, but it’ll take a bit more time.
A1_2510_CLAUDIA_100_2000	This is absurd... We all know Barnes did it!
A1_2510_DENIS_100_1000	Would you give it a rest, Claudia? Barnes just isn’t the\ntype of person who would do a thing like this!
A1_2510_CLAUDIA_100_3000	Sounds an awful lot like wishful thinking to me!
A1_2510_CLAUDIA_100_4000	Barnes simply wanted the Aurora Drop for himself.
A1_2510_CLAUDIA_100_5000	He’s been play-acting as the perfect butler, but all\nhe’s serving us is a platter of greed and deceit!
A1_2510_DENIS_100_2000	Just listen to yourself! How could you say that about\na man who’s served us faithfully for so many years?!
A1_2510_CLAUDIA_100_6000	Open your eyes already! Barnes has betrayed you!
A1_2510_TIM_100_2000	Please calm down, both of you.
A1_2510_TIM_100_3000	Barnes’s Ducklett was sighted a few minutes ago.
A1_2510_TIM_100_4000	We’re hoping that when we find Ducklett, we’ll also\nfind a clue.
A1_2510_DENIS_100_3000	Oh, excellent! I’m certain you’ll find proof that Barnes\nis innocent!
A1_2510_CLAUDIA_100_7000	And? Where is Ducklett now?
A1_2510_TIM_100_5000	She got away. We’re about to go search for her.
A1_2510_CLAUDIA_100_8000	Hmph. Such incompetence. Hurry up and find her!
A1_2510_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s not gonna be easy finding Ducklett with just the\ntwo of us.
A1_2510_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s get some help from another Pokémon to search\nfor Ducklett!
A1_25100_DKWOMANMID01_200_1000	Oh, it’s the detective’s Pikachu. Are you here to play\nwith Lillipup?
A1_25100_PIKACHU_200_1000	Sorry, but we’re investigating a case right now. Maybe\nwe can play some other time.

A1_25110_DKWOMANMID01_400_3000	You ran away because you weren’t getting\nenough play time, didn’t you?
A1_25110_DKWOMANMID01_400_4000	OK, then! Let’s play together in Serenity Park!
A1_25110_YORTERRIE_400_9000	(Huh? You’ll play with me? Yaaay!)
A1_25110_PIKACHU_400_6000	Guess that’s settled.
A1_25110_GARDIE_400_2000	(It sure feels nice to help somebody!)

A1_2520_LIVOLT02_400_2000	Manec.
A1_2520_PIKACHU_400_3000	Yeesh. Not gonna budge, eh, Manectric?
A1_2520_TIM_400_1000	The police have their reasons for keeping quiet.\nManectric is just doing its job.
A1_25200_ABURIBBON_400_1000	(Pikachu! Growlithe! Thank you so much!)
A1_25200_GARDIE_400_1000	(You’re welcome! It’s good to see they’re both safe!)
A1_25200_PIKACHU_400_1000	Seriously. I’m glad this case had a happy ending.
A1_25200_ABURIBBON_500_1000	(I just want both my Cutiefly back home...)
A1_25200_ABURIBBON_500_2000	(If you find one, please bring it here right away!)
A1_25200_PIKACHU_500_1000	You got it, Ribombee.
A1_25200_ABURIBBON_600_1000	(What’s going on?! What do I do?!)
A1_25200_PIKACHU_600_1000	What’s up, Ribombee? You look panicked!
A1_25200_ABURIBBON_600_2000	(My dear Cutiefly went out to gather nectar, but they\nhaven’t come back yet!)
A1_25200_ABURIBBON_600_3000	(It never takes them this long!)
A1_25200_ABURIBBON_600_4000	(I’m so worried... What if something’s happened?!)
A1_25200_GARDIE_600_1000	(Ribombee seems really upset...)
A1_25200_PIKACHU_600_2000	I’d like to help, but Cutiefly are really tiny Pokémon.
A1_25200_PIKACHU_600_3000	It’d be tough to find ’em in such a big city.
A1_25200_ABURIBBON_600_5000	(I don’t even know where they usually gather nectar...)
A1_25200_PIKACHU_600_4000	Hmm, let’s see...
A1_25200_PIKACHU_600_5000	Hey, Growlithe, do you think you could track down\nthe Cutiefly with your nose?
A1_25200_GARDIE_600_2000	(Definitely!)
A1_25200_GARDIE_600_3000	(I’ve already picked up the scent of the nectar\nfrom Ribombee.)
A1_25200_PIKACHU_600_6000	Then if we follow that scent, we should be able to\nfind the Cutiefly.
A1_25200_ABURIBBON_600_6000	(Could you really?! Oh, that would be incredible!)
A1_25200_ABURIBBON_600_7000	(Could you please go find my dear Cutiefly?!)
A1_25200_GARDIE_600_4000	(We’re on it!)
A1_25200_PIKACHU_600_7000	How many Cutiefly went out to gather nectar?
A1_25200_ABURIBBON_600_8000	(Two!)
A1_25200_ABURIBBON_600_9000	(I’ll be waiting here. Please bring them to me if you\nfind them!)
A1_25200_PIKACHU_600_8000	Two Cutiefly, comin’ right up.
A1_25200_PIKACHU_600_9000	Let’s go, Growlithe!
A1_25210_GARDIE_100_1000	(I can smell something sweet in this bush!)
A1_25210_PIKACHU_100_1000	There might be a Cutiefly here!
A1_25210_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hey Cutiefly! If you’re in there, come on out, please!
A1_25210_ABULY01_200_1000	(Eek! No! Go awaaay!)
A1_25210_PIKACHU_200_1000	Hey, calm down! We’re not here for your nectar!
A1_25210_ABULY01_200_2000	(Oh, really? Sorry.)
A1_25210_ABULY01_200_3000	(I thought you were here to steal the nectar I\ngathered too...)
A1_25210_PIKACHU_200_2000	Us, too? Was there someone else?
A1_25210_ABULY01_200_4000	(That’s right. A Pokémon keeps coming to steal\nmy nectar!)
A1_25210_ABULY01_200_5000	(That’s why I hid here!)
A1_25210_SECRETBERORINGA_200_1000	(Ohh, there you are!)
A1_25210_ABULY01_200_6000	(Look! It’s back!)
A1_25210_BERORINGA_400_1000	(Come on, gimme thome of your thweet tweats!)
A1_25210_PIKACHU_400_1000	Lickitung. So you’re the one causin’ problems\nfor Cutiefly.
A1_25210_BERORINGA_400_2000	(No I’m not! I juss wanna li’l necthar, thas all.)
A1_25210_GARDIE_400_1000	(With a tongue like yours, you’d take all the nectar\nCutiefly has in one lick!)
A1_25210_BERORINGA_400_3000	(Well, maybe... But I want thomething thweet!)
A1_25210_ABULY01_400_1000	(Hmm, then why don’t you come see Ribombee\nlater?)
A1_25210_ABULY01_400_2000	(If you do, I’ll share some of the pollen puffs\nRibombee makes for us.)
A1_25210_BERORINGA_400_4000	(Leally? Yaaay! OK, I guess I can wait for now.)
A1_25210_PIKACHU_400_2000	Yeesh, what a pest. Anyway, can you go on back to\nRibombee now?
A1_25210_ABULY01_400_3000	(Yes! Thank you, Pikachu and Growlithe!)
A1_25210_GARDIE_400_2000	(I’m glad we found Cutiefly!)
A1_25210_PIKACHU_400_3000	That’s all thanks to your nose.\nMuch appreciated, Growlithe!
A1_25220_GARDIE_100_1000	(There’s a sweet smell wafting down from that tree!)
A1_25220_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s too high for us to reach, though...
A1_25220_PIKACHU_100_2000	Heeey! Cutiefly! Can ya hear me?
A1_25220_ABULY02_200_1000	(Hmmm...? Who’s there?)
A1_25220_ABULY02_200_2000	(I was napping so peacefully...)
A1_25220_PIKACHU_200_1000	Wait, are you saying you didn’t come back because\nyou were napping?
A1_25220_PIKACHU_200_2000	Ribombee’s been worried sick about you!
A1_25220_ABULY02_200_3000	(Oh no! I didn’t realize so much time had passed!)
A1_25220_ABULY02_200_4000	(I’d found such a nice napping spot that I couldn’t\nresist dozing a little.)
A1_25220_PIKACHU_200_3000	Must be nice to live such a carefree life... *sigh*\nAnyway, I’m glad you’re safe.
A1_25220_ABULY02_200_5000	(Thanks for telling me! I’ll go right home!)
A1_25220_GARDIE_200_1000	(A nap, huh...)
A1_25220_PIKACHU_200_4000	Don’t feel too bad, Growlithe. Nobody’s mad at you\nfor sleeping.
A1_25230_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, we found both Cutiefly. I knew I could count\non you, Growlithe!
A1_25230_GARDIE_100_1000	(Hee hee! A compliment! I’ll have to tell Sanjee about\nthis later!)
A1_25230_PIKACHU_100_2000	You two might not speak the same language, but he\ndefinitely seems to understand your feelings.
A1_25230_PIKACHU_100_3000	Why don’t we head back and make sure those\nCutiefly made it back to Ribombee?
A1_25230_GARDIE_100_2000	(Got it! I’ll head right back!)
A1_25230_ABURIBBON_100_1000	(Pikachu! Growlithe! Thank you so much!)
A1_25230_ABURIBBON_100_2000	(Both Cutiefly came home safely!)
A1_25230_PIKACHU_100_4000	No need to thank us! Just glad to have another\ncase closed.
A1_25230_GARDIE_100_3000	(Good job coming straight home, Cutiefly!)
A1_25230_ABULY01_100_1000	(Sorry we worried you!)
A1_25230_ABURIBBON_100_3000	(Cutiefly! Please promise me two things from now on!)
A1_25230_ABURIBBON_100_4000	(One: Don’t go anywhere dangerous!\nTwo: Don’t goof around on your way home!)
A1_25230_ABULY01_100_2000	(OK, I promise!)
A1_25230_ABULY02_100_1000	(I promise!)
A1_2530_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, let’s ask Growlithe for help.
A1_2530_TIM_100_1000	I hope she can find Ducklett!
A1_25300_DKBOY01_200_1000	I want you to put some real heat on this next\npass, Raboot!
A1_25300_PIKACHU_200_1000	Wow, that boy sure is gung-ho about all this! I’m sure\nhe’ll do great in his soccer match!
A1_25300_DKBOY01_300_1000	*sigh* I wish I could find a Pokémon that’s good\nat soccer...
A1_25300_PIKACHU_300_1000	He still hasn’t found one, eh? I’ll have to look for one\nfor him with Tim later.
A1_25300_DKBOY01_400_1000	*sigh* This is real bad.
A1_25300_GARDIE_400_1000	(That boy doesn’t seem very happy...)
A1_25300_PIKACHU_400_1000	Yeah, I wonder what’s up.
A1_25300_PIKACHU_400_2000	He can’t understand us when we speak, so I’ll come\nback later with Tim.
A1_25310_PIKACHU_400_1000	Oh, it’s a Raboot. What are you up to?
A1_25310_RABBIFUTO_400_1000	(I’m about to start my dribbling practice.)
A1_25310_GARDIE_400_1000	(Oooh, are you good with your feet? Cool!)
A1_25310_PIKACHU_400_2000	Hmm... Raboot might be a good partner for soccer\npractice.
A1_25310_PIKACHU_400_3000	Hey, Raboot. I know a kid that’d love to kick a ball\naround with you.
A1_25310_PIKACHU_400_4000	If you’ve got some time, would you be willing to\nplay with him?
A1_25310_RABBIFUTO_400_2000	(Kick a ball with a human? All right! I’ll do it!)
A1_25310_PIKACHU_400_5000	Oh, you will? Thanks so much, Raboot.
A1_25310_RABBIFUTO_400_3000	(Where is this kid, anyway?)
A1_25310_PIKACHU_400_6000	Wow, you’re serious about this! Great! Wait here, OK?\nI'll talk to my partner Tim and bring the kid to you.
A1_25310_RABBIFUTO_400_4000	(Check out THESE moves, kid!)
A1_25310_DKBOY01_400_1000	Those eyes... Th-they look really fired up!\nThis Pokémon is the coolest, Mr. Detective!
A1_25310_DKBOY01_400_2000	I’d be so happy if you practiced with me...
A1_25310_DKBOY01_400_3000	Let’s play some soccer together, Raboot!
A1_25310_RABBIFUTO_400_5000	(I can see the motivation in your eyes, boy. All right!\nI’ll join you!)
A1_25310_DKBOY01_400_4000	It nodded! Thank you, Raboot!
A1_25310_DKBOY01_400_5000	OK, let’s get this practice started! We’re gonna win\nthe match for sure now!
A1_25310_TIM_400_1000	Good luck—hope you do well!
A1_25310_DKBOY01_400_6000	Thanks!
A1_25310_DKBOY01_400_7000	I hope we can be friends, Raboot!
A1_25310_RABBIFUTO_400_6000	(You got it!)
A1_25310_PIKACHU_400_7000	I guess soccer players don’t need words to hit it off\nwhen they share a love of the game.
A1_25310_GARDIE_400_2000	(I’m glad to see both Raboot and the boy looking\nso happy!)
A1_25310_PIKACHU_500_1000	Hey, Raboot! Got a minute?
A1_25310_RABBIFUTO_500_1000	(I’m busy planning out my drills for the day.)
A1_25310_RABBIFUTO_500_2000	(Please, don’t disturb me.)
A1_25310_PIKACHU_500_2000	Whoops, sorry about that. We’ll come back later.
A1_25320_RABBIFUTO_100_1000	(Thank you for introducing me to a kid with such\npotential, Pikachu.)
A1_25320_PIKACHU_100_1000	Glad you feel that way! Makes all our work helping\npeople worth it.
A1_2540_PIKACHU_100_1000	Growlithe, I’ve got a favor to ask of you and that\nexcellent nose of yours.
A1_2540_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’d like your help finding Ducklett.
A1_2540_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow?
A1_2540_PIKACHU_100_3000	It’s possible that Ducklett is somehow mixed up in\nthis incident.
A1_2540_PIKACHU_100_4000	She might even know who stole the key from you.
A1_2540_PIKACHU_100_5000	We really need your help to solve this case!
A1_2540_GARDIE_100_2000	Gow!
A1_2540_PIKACHU_100_6000	Oh, really? You’ve been wanting to help Denis too?
A1_2540_GARDIE_100_3000	Gow gow!
A1_2540_TIM_100_1000	Great! Thank you, Growlithe!
A1_2540_GARDIE_100_4000	Gow.
A1_2540_PIKACHU_100_7000	Huh? You want me to ride on your back?
A1_2540_GARDIE_100_5000	Gow!
A1_2540_PIKACHU_100_8000	Ah, so you can take me wherever the scent leads you?
A1_2540_PIKACHU_100_9000	Got it. That should be a lot easier than trying to\ngive directions at every turn!
A1_2540_GARDIE_100_6000	Gow!
A1_2540_PIKACHU_100_10000	What do you think, Tim? You want us to track this\nscent down right away?
A1_2540_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_2540_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_2540_TIM_300_1000	Yeah. Can I leave it to you?
A1_2540_PIKACHU_300_1000	You got it!
A1_2540_PIKACHU_300_2000	Let’s go, Growlithe!
A1_2540_TIM_400_1000	I think there’s a bit more I want to investigate first.
A1_2540_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. We’ll ask Growlithe for help afterward, then.
A1_2540_PIKACHU_400_2000	Let’s ask her again when you’re ready.
A1_2540_GARDIE_400_1000	Gow!
A1_25400_WOMANQUIZ_200_1000	Oh, if it isn’t the detective’s Pikachu!
A1_25400_WOMANQUIZ_200_2000	I hope you and your partner will be ready for another\none of my quizzes soon!
A1_25400_WOMANQUIZ_300_1000	The detective’s Pikachu is riding a Growlithe!
A1_25400_PIKACHU_300_1000	You don’t think she’s gonna make a quiz question\nabout us...do you?
A1_25400_WOMANQUIZ_400_1000	The detective’s Pikachu is riding a Growlithe!
A1_25400_PIKACHU_400_1000	You don’t think she’s gonna make a quiz question\nabout us...do you?
A1_25400_WOMANQUIZ_500_1000	The detective’s Pikachu is riding a Growlithe!
A1_25400_PIKACHU_500_1000	You don’t think she’s gonna make a quiz question\nabout us...do you?
A1_25410_BERORINGA_400_1000	(Aren’t there any thweet tweats anywhere?)
A1_25410_PIKACHU_400_1000	Lickitung seems completely absorbed in her search\nfor snacks.
A1_25410_BERORINGA_500_1000	(Aren’t there any thweet tweats anywhere?)
A1_25410_PIKACHU_500_1000	Lickitung sure has a long tongue...
A1_25410_PIKACHU_500_2000	Lickitung might be the answer to that trivia question.
A1_25410_PIKACHU_500_3000	Guess I’ll tell Tim later—then we can visit the quiz\nprofessor together.
A1_25420_CHORONEKO_400_1000	(Awww, shucks! I didn’t think I’d get found out!)
A1_25420_PIKACHU_400_1000	You shouldn’t steal things from people! Come on,\nshow a little remorse!
A1_25420_PIKACHU_500_1000	There’s a Purrloin.
A1_25420_CHORONEKO_500_1000	(Hello, Pikachu! What a nice hat!)
A1_25420_PIKACHU_500_2000	Yeah, pretty cool, isn’t it?
A1_25420_CHORONEKO_500_2000	(Yes, very cool! Can you come a little closer to give\nme a better look?)
A1_25420_PIKACHU_500_3000	Hey. Stare all you want, but I’m not givin’ you my hat.
A1_25420_PIKACHU_500_4000	Actually...don’t you have a habit of stealing stuff?
A1_25420_CHORONEKO_500_3000	*gulp*
A1_25420_PIKACHU_500_5000	I bet Purrloin’s the answer to that question from the\nquiz professor.
A1_25420_CHORONEKO_600_1000	(Hello, Pikachu!)
A1_25420_PIKACHU_600_1000	You sure look cheerful, Purrloin. What a smile!
A1_25430_TAIRETSU_400_1000	(What do you want? We’re busy practicing our\nformations right now.)
A1_25430_PIKACHU_400_1000	Oh, sorry. Don’t mind me.
A1_25430_GARDIE_400_1000	(They’re always doing something or other\naround here.)
A1_25430_TAIRETSU_500_1000	(What do you want? We’re busy practicing our\nformations right now.)
A1_25430_PIKACHU_500_1000	Oh, sorry. Don’t mind me.
A1_25430_GARDIE_500_1000	(They’re always doing something or other\naround here.)
A1_25430_PIKACHU_500_2000	All six of them are moving in perfect unison. That’s\nreally impressive.
A1_25430_PIKACHU_500_3000	Come to think of it, Falinks might be the answer to\nthat quiz professor’s question.
A1_25430_TAIRETSU_600_1000	(What do you want? We’re busy practicing our\nformations right now.)
A1_25430_PIKACHU_600_1000	Oh, sorry. Don’t mind me.
A1_25430_GARDIE_600_1000	(They’re always doing something or other\naround here.)
A1_25510_USOKKIE_100_1000	(Time for another day of pretendin’ to be a tree!)
A1_25510_GARDIE_100_1000	(Whoa! For a second I thought a tree just talked—but\nit’s actually a Pokémon!)
A1_25510_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, that’s a Sudowoodo. They have a habit of\npretending to be trees.
A1_25510_USOKKIE_100_2000	(OK, think tree thoughts... Branches... Bark...)
A1_25510_PIKACHU_100_2000	Looks like it’s gettin’ into character.
A1_25510_GARDIE_100_2000	(But won’t it get in everyone’s way if it stays here?)
A1_25510_PIKACHU_100_3000	You’re right.
A1_25510_PIKACHU_100_4000	Hey, Sudowoodo—if you wanna practice, you should\ntry doing it somewhere else.
A1_25510_PIKACHU_100_5000	This location totally blows your cover.
A1_25510_USOKKIE_100_3000	(Wha?! You can tell I’m not a tree?! Noooooo!)
A1_25510_GARDIE_100_3000	(It took that pretty hard.)
A1_25510_PIKACHU_100_6000	I guess it thought it was blending in perfectly.
A1_2560_GARDIE_100_1000	(This is the first time I’ve ever given someone a ride.)
A1_2560_PIKACHU_100_1000	She says this is the first time she’s ever given someone\na ride.
A1_2560_GARDIE_100_2000	(Why did you just repeat what I said?)
A1_2560_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh, whoops.
A1_2560_PIKACHU_100_3000	When it’s just you and me talking, I guess I don’t need\nto interpret for Tim.
A1_2560_PIKACHU_100_4000	Anyway, let’s get this search underway! How do you\ntrack the scent?
A1_2560_GARDIE_100_3000	(I just sniff the ground, and I can tell where the scent\nis strongest.)
A1_2560_PIKACHU_100_5000	Gotcha—look for where the scent is strongest.
A1_2560_GARDIE_100_4000	(Right. And there are still traces of Ducklett’s scent\ninside the house.)
A1_2560_GARDIE_100_5000	(I think I can track her from here.)
A1_2560_PIKACHU_100_6000	OK, then let’s get going, Growlithe!
A1_2560_GARDIE_100_6000	(Yeah!)
A1_25600_MAAIIKA_100_1000	(Hee hee hee! Who should I startle next?)
A1_25600_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey now. Try not to overdo it on the pranks, yeah?
A1_2570_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow? Growgow?
A1_2570_PIKACHU_100_1000	She’s asking what you want.
A1_2570_PIKACHU_100_2000	Do you wanna talk to her? Or have her track a scent?
A1_2570_SEL_0_1000	Ask for her help
A1_2570_SEL_0_2000	Talk to her
A1_2570_PIKACHU_300_1000	Hey, Growlithe! Let me hop back up on your back!
A1_2570_GARDIE_300_1000	Gow!
A1_25700_MAHOMIL_200_1000	(My cream pairs really well with Pablo’s coffee!)
A1_25700_MAHOMIL_300_1000	(How would you like some creamy cream?)
A1_25700_PIKACHU_300_1000	Oh, hi there, Milcery. What are you doing here?
A1_25700_MAHOMIL_300_2000	(I’m here for the coffee of course!)
A1_25700_MAHOMIL_300_3000	(As soon as I smelled it I thought it would go perfectly\nwith my cream, so I decided to help out here.)
A1_25700_PIKACHU_300_2000	I see. Very proactive of you.
A1_25700_PIKACHU_300_3000	I’m sure your cream is great and all, but I happen to\nprefer my coffee black.
A1_25700_PIKACHU_300_4000	I’m sure Tim’ll have some the next time he’s here.
A1_25700_MAHOMIL_300_4000	(Sure thing! But you’re really missing out.)
A1_26010_DCBOY01_100_1000	Aw, c’mon! Lickitung stopped AGAIN?!
A1_26010_DCBOY01_100_2000	She keeps getting distracted!
A1_26020_DAWOMAN01_100_1000	Tsareena sure must have been thirsty.
A1_26030_DABUSINESSWOMAN01_100_1000	Someone seems to have planted a tree right\nin the middle of the path.
A1_26030_DABUSINESSWOMAN01_100_2000	It’s such an inconvenience!
A1_26035_DABUSINESSWOMAN01_100_1000	Huh? Someone must’ve replanted that tree in the\nflower bed... But when?
A1_26050_DHGIRL01_100_1000	Great job, Maractus! Your dancing is so cute!
A1_26050_DHGIRL01_100_2000	From the top! One, two, one, two...
A1_26050_MARACACCHI_100_1000	(This place is so lively and fun!)
A1_2610_TIM_100_1000	How did your investigation with Growlithe\ngo, Pikachu?
A1_2610_PIKACHU_100_1000	About that, Tim! We found some incredible evidence!
A1_2610_TIM_100_2000	Really? What is it?
A1_2610_PIKACHU_100_2000	Well, you see...
A1_2610_PIKACHU_100_3000	...And that’s about it.
A1_2610_TIM_100_3000	Wow! Good work, Pikachu! I think we’re definitely\ncloser to solving the case now.
A1_2610_PIKACHU_100_4000	Yep—now hurry up and open your case notebook!
A1_2610_PIKACHU_100_5000	Let’s think this over together and organize all the\ninfo we’ve got!
A1_2620_TIM_100_1000	So there’s someone out there behind all this...
A1_2620_PIKACHU_100_1000	And not only that, there were multiple culprits\nworking together.
A1_2620_PIKACHU_100_2000	Someone who sent Pokémon in from outside, and\nsomeone inside the mansion who let them in.
A1_2620_TIM_100_2000	You think whoever let the Pokémon inside lives in\nthe mansion?
A1_2620_PIKACHU_100_3000	That seems like the natural conclusion.
A1_2620_TIM_100_3000	But how did the culprit unlock the door to the jewel\nstorage room?
A1_2620_TIM_100_4000	Only Barnes and Mr. Denis can use the key, right?
A1_2620_PIKACHU_100_4000	Usually, yeah... But the culprit found a way.
A1_2620_TIM_100_5000	A way to what?
A1_2620_PIKACHU_100_5000	Think about it, Tim.
A1_2620_PIKACHU_100_6000	When did Growlithe say the key disappeared?
A1_2620_SEL_0_1000	When she was sleeping
A1_2620_SEL_0_2000	When she was eating
A1_2620_TIM_300_1000	She said it disappeared while she was sleeping.
A1_2620_PIKACHU_300_1000	That’s right. And anyone could have taken the key\nwhile Growlithe was asleep.
A1_2620_TIM_300_2000	Hmm, I guess you’re right.
A1_2620_PIKACHU_400_1000	No, we never heard that.
A1_2620_PIKACHU_400_2000	It was some other time, remember?
A1_2630_TIM_100_1000	But Growlithe doesn’t usually nap.
A1_2630_TIM_100_2000	Do you really think she’d just happen to nap right\nwhen they were about to commit the crime?
A1_2630_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s just it.
A1_2630_PIKACHU_100_2000	Think back on what all the different Pokémon in the\nmansion told us.
A1_2630_PIKACHU_100_3000	Did you notice anything they had in common?\nAnything strange?
A1_2630_SEL_0_1000	All of them ate breakfast
A1_2630_SEL_0_2000	All of them left the mansion
A1_2630_SEL_0_3000	All of them went to sleep
A1_2630_PIKACHU_300_1000	They definitely all ate, but the key hadn’t been\nstolen yet at the time.
A1_2630_PIKACHU_300_2000	When was Growlithe’s key taken? Think back on the\ntestimony we’ve heard.
A1_2630_PIKACHU_400_1000	Cramorant and Ducklett left the mansion, but\nGrowlithe and Clefable were still at home.
A1_2630_PIKACHU_400_2000	So that’s not it.
A1_2630_TIM_500_1000	All the Pokémon from the mansion said they\nfell asleep!
A1_2630_PIKACHU_500_1000	That’s right, Tim. Glad you noticed that.
A1_2640_PIKACHU_100_1000	This is the dish that Growlithe’s food was in.
A1_2640_TIM_100_1000	There’s some sort of powder on it.
A1_2640_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hey, Tim—<color=#F39800FF>this is sleep powder</color>!
A1_2640_TIM_100_2000	Wow, you could tell that just by looking, Pikachu?
A1_2640_PIKACHU_100_3000	I’m a Pokémon, remember? Not to mention a\ngreat detective.
A1_2640_PIKACHU_100_4000	Of course I can tell what kind of powder this is.\nIt’s not even something to brag about.
A1_2640_TIM_100_3000	Which means...there was sleep powder in the food.
A1_2640_PIKACHU_100_5000	I think we can be pretty sure of that.
A1_2640_PIKACHU_200_1000	There was sleep powder on Growlithe’s food dish.
A1_2640_TIM_200_1000	Does sleep powder really make you that sleepy?\nI’m curious...
A1_2640_PIKACHU_200_2000	No, Tim, don’t get too close to it! That’s powerful\nstuff!
A1_2640_TIM_200_2000	Whoa, you weren’t kidding... Just a tiny whiff’s got me\nfeeling drowsy.
A1_2645_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s getting easier to picture just how the crime\nwas committed.
A1_2645_TIM_100_1000	But where could the culprit have gotten the sleep\npowder in the first place?
A1_2645_PIKACHU_100_2000	In this city? I can think of a few places.
A1_2645_PIKACHU_100_3000	But if we follow the path that was used to bring it\ninside, we might learn more about the culprit.
A1_2645_TIM_100_2000	You’ll need Growlithe’s help again for that, right?\nWhy don’t you take a little of the powder with you\njust in case?
A1_2645_PIKACHU_100_4000	One step ahead of ya!
A1_2645_PIKACHU_100_5000	Now let’s go talk to Growlithe, Tim!
A1_2650_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey Growlithe, can you take a whiff of this sleep\npowder we found on your dish?
A1_2650_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow!
A1_2650_PIKACHU_100_2000	Thanks. Careful not to sniff up too much, though!
A1_2650_GARDIE_100_2000	Gow gow!
A1_2650_PIKACHU_100_3000	OK, now we can follow the scent of the sleep\npowder, right?
A1_2650_PIKACHU_100_4000	Then let’s get going, Growlithe!
A1_2660_TIM_100_1000	I see. So you’re still not sure who the culprit is.
A1_2660_PIKACHU_100_1000	Right. But we did learn something important.
A1_2660_TIM_100_2000	And what’s that?
A1_2660_PIKACHU_100_2000	Think about it, Tim.
A1_2660_PIKACHU_100_3000	The sleep powder’s scent trail led directly from the\nmansion to the terrace.
A1_2660_PIKACHU_100_4000	Do you really think that’s normal?
A1_2660_TIM_100_3000	I guess it would make sense if the person who brought\nthe sleep powder already lived in the mansion.
A1_2660_PIKACHU_100_5000	Exactly—which makes it even more likely that it\nwas an inside job.
A1_2710_KOARUHIE_200_1000	Duc?
A1_2710_PIKACHU_200_1000	Don’t worry. We’re not here to catch you or anything.
A1_2710_TIM_200_1000	We want to hurry and solve this case for your sake\ntoo, Ducklett.
A1_2710_KOARUHIE_200_2000	Ducklett!
A1_2720_PIKACHU_100_1000	Mind if we ask you some questions, Lilligant?
A1_2720_DREDEAR_100_1000	Ligant!\n
A1_2720_SEL_0_1000	About you, Lilligant...
A1_2720_SEL_0_2000	About this place...
A1_2720_SEL_0_3000	About sleep powder...
A1_2720_PIKACHU_300_1000	How do you usually spend your time, Lilligant?
A1_2720_DREDEAR_300_1000	Lilligant.
A1_2720_PIKACHU_300_2000	Every day you just dance or play however you\nplease, eh?
A1_2720_TIM_300_1000	Sounds fun.
A1_2720_PIKACHU_300_3000	Sure does. Lilligant must not have a care in the world.
A1_2720_DREDEAR_300_2000	Lilligant!
A1_2720_PIKACHU_300_4000	It says the secret to beauty is not allowing stress to\nbuild up.
A1_2720_PIKACHU_400_1000	Come here often, Lilligant?
A1_2720_DREDEAR_400_1000	Gant!
A1_2720_PIKACHU_400_2000	Lilligant says this is its favorite spot because it gets so\nmuch sunlight here.\n
A1_2720_TIM_400_1000	This place does look good for sunbathing.
A1_2720_PIKACHU_500_1000	Are you sure this is your sleep powder?
A1_2720_DREDEAR_500_1000	Lilligant.
A1_2720_PIKACHU_500_2000	Without a doubt, it says.
A1_2720_TIM_500_1000	So the thief used Lilligant’s sleep powder.
A1_2720_PIKACHU_500_3000	But Lilligant says it can’t remember the person’s face.
A1_2726_KONGPANG_100_1000	Venonat.
A1_2726_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a Venonat.
A1_2726_TIM_100_1000	What’s it doing here?
A1_2726_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s try asking.
A1_2730_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey Venonat, can we ask you some questions?
A1_2730_KONGPANG_100_1000	Venonat! Venonat.
A1_2730_SEL_0_1000	About you, Venonat...
A1_2730_SEL_0_2000	About this place...
A1_2730_SEL_0_3000	About sleep powder...
A1_2730_PIKACHU_300_1000	How do you usually spend your time, Venonat?
A1_2730_KONGPANG_300_1000	Venonat! Venonat!
A1_2730_PIKACHU_300_2000	Oh, you play tag with your Pokémon friends?\nSounds fun.
A1_2730_TIM_300_1000	It doesn’t look very fast... Is tag really a good game\nfor it?
A1_2730_PIKACHU_300_3000	Are you any good at tag, Venonat?
A1_2730_KONGPANG_300_2000	Venonat!
A1_2730_PIKACHU_300_4000	It says it’s faster than it looks!
A1_2730_TIM_300_2000	I don’t know about fast... Looks more like it just can’t\nsit still.
A1_2730_PIKACHU_400_1000	Do you always hang out around here, Venonat?
A1_2730_KONGPANG_400_1000	Venonat. Venonat!
A1_2730_PIKACHU_400_2000	It says this place is the best ’cause the view is great\nand lots of little bugs gather here.
A1_2730_TIM_400_1000	Little bugs?
A1_2730_PIKACHU_400_3000	It may sound kinda gross, but Venonat needs ’em.
A1_2730_KONGPANG_400_2000	Venonat!
A1_2730_PIKACHU_500_1000	Is this your sleep powder, Venonat?
A1_2730_KONGPANG_500_1000	Venonat? Venonat...
A1_2730_PIKACHU_500_2000	<color=#F39800FF>It does use sleep powder to catch little bugs...</color>
A1_2730_KONGPANG_500_2000	Venonat.
A1_2730_PIKACHU_500_3000	But its sleep powder doesn’t have such a nice\nfragrance.
A1_2730_TIM_500_1000	It sounds like Venonat doesn’t have anything to do\nwith our case.
A1_2800_YABUKURON_100_1000	Trub!
A1_2800_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wait! I promise this guy won’t cause you any trouble.
A1_2800_PIKACHU_100_2000	You don’t gotta run away.
A1_2800_YABUKURON_100_2000	Truuub!
A1_2800_TIM_100_1000	Sorry for startling you.
A1_2800_YABUKURON_100_3000	Trub!
A1_2800_PIKACHU_100_3000	He says don’t worry about it.
A1_2800_TIM_100_2000	Thanks for always keeping our city clean, Trubbish.
A1_2800_YABUKURON_200_1000	Trub!
A1_2800_PIKACHU_200_1000	Yeah, go ahead and take your time with your meal.
A1_2810_TIM_100_1000	It’s Turner’s Cramorant.
A1_2810_PIKACHU_100_1000	Still haven’t made it back to the mansion, huh?
A1_2810_UU_100_1000	Craaam...
A1_2810_PIKACHU_100_2000	Your stomach’s so full it’s hard to move? Are you OK?
A1_2810_UU_100_2000	Craaam...
A1_2810_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hey, we’ve got some questions we’d like to ask you.\nWould that be OK?
A1_2810_UU_100_3000	Cramoraaant...
A1_2810_PIKACHU_100_4000	You’re so full you don’t feel like talking?
A1_2810_PIKACHU_100_5000	C’mon, please just try.
A1_2810_UU_100_4000	Craaam...
A1_2810_TIM_100_2000	If he can’t talk, I guess we should just give him some\nmore time.
A1_2810_PIKACHU_100_6000	Yeah...
A1_2810_PIKACHU_100_7000	Let’s check in on Cramorant later.
A1_2814_PIKACHU_100_1000	Turner’s the one who used the sleep powder.
A1_2814_PIKACHU_100_2000	But that’s just conjecture. We don’t have any\nhard evidence.
A1_2814_TIM_100_1000	We’ll definitely need to find some proof, but I’m not\nsure how...
A1_2814_PIKACHU_100_3000	It’s kind of an aggressive move, but we could try\nshaking him up a bit.
A1_2814_PIKACHU_100_4000	Let’s see if we can make Turner nervous. We might\nlearn something based on how he reacts.
A1_2814_PIKACHU_100_5000	Think you’re up to it?
A1_2814_TIM_100_2000	It’s worth a try!
A1_2815_TURNER_100_1000	Oh, hello Tim. How’s the investigation going?
A1_2815_TIM_100_1000	We’re actually a bit stuck at the moment...
A1_2815_TURNER_100_2000	I’m sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do\nto help?
A1_2815_TIM_100_2000	I was actually hoping to ask you a few more\nquestions, if you don’t mind.
A1_2815_TURNER_100_3000	By all means, ask away.
A1_2815_TURNER_200_1000	Y-you still need something, Tim?
A1_2815_SEL_0_1000	About Cramorant...
A1_2815_SEL_0_2000	About Pawniard...
A1_2815_TIM_300_1000	You’ve got a partner Cramorant, right, Mr. Turner?
A1_2815_TURNER_300_1000	Wha—! How do you know that?!
A1_2815_TIM_300_2000	It came up while we were gathering statements in\nthe city.
A1_2815_TURNER_300_2000	Hmph. I see.
A1_2815_TURNER_300_3000	I hope you don’t think I was hiding that fact or\nanything. I was just afraid he might become a suspect.
A1_2815_TURNER_300_4000	I did tell the police, of course!
A1_2815_PIKACHU_300_1000	Really?
A1_2815_TURNER_300_5000	It’s been a while since I’ve seen him, actually.\nWorryingly so.
A1_2815_TURNER_300_6000	Where could he have gone...?
A1_2815_TIM_300_3000	Oh, we just saw Cramorant walking back toward\nthe mansion.
A1_2815_TURNER_300_7000	Why that little—! I told him to stay put!
A1_2815_PIKACHU_300_2000	Hm? Stay put?
A1_2815_TIM_300_4000	Why did you tell him that, Mr. Turner?
A1_2815_TURNER_300_8000	Oh, er... I just didn’t want him going out on his own.
A1_2815_TURNER_300_9000	I’ve been so worried that he might have gotten\nmixed up in the crime somehow.
A1_2815_TURNER_300_10000	Thank you so much for finding him, Tim. It’s such a\nhuge relief...
A1_2815_TIM_400_1000	We’re thinking a Pawniard may have cut the\njewel case.
A1_2815_TURNER_400_1000	Really?!
A1_2815_TURNER_400_2000	I-I mean, yes! I think you’ve cracked it!
A1_2815_TIM_400_2000	So it was a Pawniard that punched you, Mr. Turner?
A1_2815_TURNER_400_3000	Yes, it most certainly was!
A1_2815_TURNER_400_4000	It really hurt... In fact, it STILL hurts!
A1_2815_PIKACHU_400_1000	Yeesh, what a terrible liar.
A1_2820_PIKACHU_100_1000	Based on Turner’s reaction, it’s pretty clear that he’s\nhiding something.
A1_2820_TIM_100_1000	I just wish I’d been able to dig a little deeper...
A1_2820_PIKACHU_100_2000	Nah, you did a great job.
A1_2820_PIKACHU_100_3000	At the very least, we learned one thing: Cramorant is\nthe key to solving this case!
A1_2820_PIKACHU_100_4000	All that’s left is to ask him ourselves!
A1_2820_TIM_100_2000	So we’re going to go see Cramorant.
A1_2820_PIKACHU_100_5000	Yep. Just you wait, Turner! We’ll catch you yet!
A1_2830_TIM_100_1000	Look, Pikachu—it’s Cramorant!
A1_2830_PIKACHU_100_1000	Weren’t you gonna go back to Turner? Didn’t make it\nvery far, did ya?
A1_2830_UU_100_1000	Cramoraaant...
A1_2830_PIKACHU_100_2000	You’ve been resting ’cause you feel too full to walk?
A1_2830_UU_100_2000	Craaam...
A1_2830_TIM_100_2000	Why is Cramorant the only one that feels so unwell?
A1_2830_TIM_100_3000	Growlithe and the others were fine.
A1_2830_PIKACHU_100_3000	He must’ve REALLY overeaten, or he swallowed\nsomething his digestive system can’t han—
A1_2830_PIKACHU_100_4000	Hey, wait a second...
A1_2850_TIM_100_1000	Did you figure something out, Pikachu?
A1_2850_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh yeah, I got it ALL figured out!
A1_2860_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, we’ve got all the proof we need. Now we just\nhave to catch the culprit!
A1_2860_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s go tell Holiday to gather everyone involved with\nthe case.
A1_2860_PIKACHU_100_3000	Are you ready, Tim?
A1_2860_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_2860_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_2860_TIM_300_1000	Yeah, let’s go!
A1_2860_TIM_300_2000	Let’s reveal the truth together!
A1_2860_TIM_400_1000	Wait, there’s something I want to do first.
A1_2860_PIKACHU_400_1000	Oh yeah? Then let’s go see Holiday once you’re\nready.
A1_2860_PIKACHU_400_2000	We’ve gotta round up all the suspects, after all.
A1_2865_UU_100_1000	Craaam...
A1_2865_PIKACHU_100_1000	Still don’t feel up to talking? That’s fine. We’ve\nalready got what we need.
A1_2865_UU_100_2000	Cram?
A1_2865_PIKACHU_100_2000	You just hurry on home to Turner.
A1_2865_PIKACHU_100_3000	I’m sure he’s waiting for you.
A1_2865_UU_100_3000	Cramoraaant...
A1_2865_TIM_100_1000	All right then, let’s go get ready.
A1_2865_PIKACHU_100_4000	Yeah, let’s go!
A1_2870_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, are you ready now?
A1_2870_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_2870_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_2870_TIM_300_1000	Sure am.
A1_2870_PIKACHU_300_1000	OK then. Time to blow this case wide open!
A1_2870_TIM_300_2000	Excuse me, Inspector Holiday. I have a favor to ask.
A1_2870_HOLIDAY_300_1000	What’s that, Tim?
A1_2870_TIM_300_3000	Could you please gather everyone who’s involved\nin the case?
A1_2870_HOLIDAY_300_2000	...Sure, if you say so. I’ll have ’em brought together\nright away.
A1_2870_TIM_400_1000	I feel like there’s something I still haven’t done...
A1_2870_PIKACHU_400_1000	Oh yeah?
A1_2870_PIKACHU_400_2000	We can hold off on talking to Holiday, then.
A1_29010_GARDIE_100_1000	(Oooh, I smell something sweet! I bet it’s delicious!)
A1_29010_PIKACHU_100_1000	We COULD stop for a snack...
A1_29010_GARDIE_100_2000	(No way! We’re in the middle of an investigation!)
A1_29030_GARDIE_100_1000	(A Berry cake? Wow, that sounds so good.\nI want some!)
A1_29030_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hold that thought. We can come get some once we’re\ndone investigating.
A1_29030_GARDIE_100_2000	(Right. Investigation first, then cake!)
A1_29040_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like a painting of Ho-Oh.
A1_29040_GARDIE_100_1000	(It’s one of Sanjee and Claudia’s favorite pictures.)
A1_29040_GARDIE_100_2000	(I heard they got it as a wedding present.)
A1_29040_PIKACHU_100_2000	A wedding present? It must be important to them.
A1_29050_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a painting of Lugia.
A1_29050_GARDIE_100_1000	(It’s one of Sanjee and Claudia’s favorite pictures.)
A1_29050_GARDIE_100_2000	(Turner polishes the frame till it’s shiny every day.)
A1_29050_PIKACHU_100_2000	He polishes a picture frame this big every single day?\nTurner must be a hard worker...
A1_29070_GARDIE_100_1000	(Sanjee works here a lot.)
A1_29070_PIKACHU_100_1000	So he uses this room as a study, huh?
A1_29080_GARDIE_100_1000	(I don’t like this brown water.)
A1_29080_PIKACHU_100_1000	There probably aren’t many Pokémon with a taste\nfor tea.
A1_29110_GARDIE_100_1000	(There are a bunch of big drums stuck together.)
A1_29110_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s called a drumset. These things are essential if you\nwanna put on a good show!
A1_29120_GARDIE_100_1000	(Humans use their paws to make noise come out of\nthis thing, right?)
A1_29120_PIKACHU_100_1000	Huh. When you put it like that, you’re not wrong...
A1_29130_PIKACHU_100_1000	Whaddya say? Want me to play you a song?
A1_29130_GARDIE_100_1000	(No, that’s OK. You probably can’t play it anyway.)
A1_29130_PIKACHU_100_2000	Urk...
A1_29140_GARDIE_100_1000	(Claudia has some of these flat things, too.)
A1_29140_PIKACHU_100_1000	She likes records, huh? Guess she’s got pretty\ngood taste.
A1_29150_GARDIE_100_1000	(I think even I could play this instrument!)
A1_29150_PIKACHU_100_1000	Not so fast, Growlithe. Even simple things like this\ntake a long time to master.
A1_29160_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s a TV shopping channel playing.
A1_29160_PIKACHU_100_2000	They’re selling a massage tool developed in part by\nMetagross, and a CD full of Jigglypuff songs from\nevery region.
A1_29160_PIKACHU_100_3000	...I kinda want ’em both...
A1_29170_GARDIE_100_1000	(I think I smell this at the house sometimes.)
A1_29170_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oooh! Looks like there’re some new beans in stock...\nThat’s Pablo for ya!
A1_29170_PIKACHU_100_2000	Maybe I can sneak out tonight to try some.
A1_29180_PIKACHU_100_1000	What a pretty jewel!
A1_29180_GARDIE_100_1000	(All the ones in here are Sanjee’s and Claudia’s\nfavorites.)
A1_29190_PIKACHU_100_1000	Ooh, a green jewel.
A1_29190_GARDIE_100_1000	(Pikachu, if you keep touching the case like that,\nyou’ll get in trouble!)
A1_2920_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m sure Holiday will look into his accomplice.
A1_2920_TIM_100_1000	Right. Let’s leave that to the police.
A1_2920_DENIS_100_1000	Was I wrong this whole time?
A1_2920_DENIS_100_2000	For us here, the Aurora Drop was a symbol of hope.
A1_2920_DENIS_100_3000	I thought it could bring hope to even more people.
A1_2920_DENIS_100_4000	That’s why I decided to donate it.
A1_2920_DENIS_100_5000	But I never thought it would lead to an incident\nlike this...
A1_2920_DENIS_100_6000	Maybe I should forget about donating it and\njust keep it quietly locked up in the house...
A1_2920_CLAUDIA_100_1000	Goodness gracious. You, of all people...
A1_2920_CLAUDIA_100_2000	Do you really think so little of the Aurora Drop?
A1_2920_DENIS_100_7000	What are you saying, Claudia?
A1_2920_CLAUDIA_100_3000	Didn’t you tell me yourself?
A1_2920_CLAUDIA_100_4000	That you hoped whoever looked at the Aurora Drop\nwould not only see its beauty...
A1_2920_CLAUDIA_100_5000	but also feel cheered up and encouraged by it?
A1_2920_CLAUDIA_100_6000	Are you really going to give up on that hope just\nbecause of a stroke of bad luck?
A1_2920_CLAUDIA_100_7000	Wouldn’t that be a terrible waste?
A1_2920_CLAUDIA_100_8000	Don’t you agree, Barnes?
A1_2920_BURNS_100_1000	Indeed, madam. It’s just as you say.
A1_2920_BURNS_100_2000	Mr. Denis, your plan to donate the jewel to the\npeople of Ryme City...
A1_2920_BURNS_100_3000	was most certainly not a mistake.
A1_2920_BURNS_100_4000	Please believe in yourself and do what you think\nis best.
A1_2920_DENIS_100_8000	Claudia... Barnes...
A1_2920_DENIS_100_9000	Forgive me. I think I let myself get too shaken by\nwhat happened today.
A1_2920_DENIS_100_10000	I believe in the beauty of the Aurora Drop and the\npeople of Ryme City.
A1_2920_CLAUDIA_100_9000	As you should.
A1_2920_PIXY_100_1000	Clefable!
A1_2920_DENIS_100_11000	But Claudia, weren’t you against the donation?
A1_2920_CLAUDIA_100_10000	Don’t misunderstand me.
A1_2920_CLAUDIA_100_11000	I just don’t want to deal with you moping around like\nthis for the rest of our lives, that’s all!
A1_2920_DENIS_100_12000	Heh, I see. Thank you, Claudia.
A1_2920_CLAUDIA_100_12000	This incident has forced me to...reconsider, shall we\nsay, some of my views.
A1_2920_CLAUDIA_100_13000	Clefable, Ducklett, Growlithe... Let’s all eat together\nfrom now on!
A1_2920_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow!
A1_2920_TIM_100_2000	It looks like Mr. Denis and the others are all getting\nalong better now.
A1_2920_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah. That about wraps this up.
A1_29200_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a blue jewel.
A1_29200_GARDIE_100_1000	(Someday I’d like to give a shiny rock to Sanjee, too.)
A1_29200_PIKACHU_100_2000	I think Denis would be happy to get just about\nanything if he knew it was coming from you.
A1_29210_PIKACHU_100_1000	A red jewel.
A1_29210_GARDIE_100_1000	(It’s the same color as Sanjee’s clothes today!)
A1_30010_AMAJO_100_1000	Reena!
A1_30020_DKMANOLD01_100_1000	I could watch Purrloin all\nday and never get bored!
A1_30030_YESSAN_100_1000	Indeee!
A1_30040_YOKUBARISU_100_1000	Greeed!
A1_30060_DHWOMANOLD01_100_1000	Indeedee really helps loosen\nup the knots in my shoulders.
A1_30070_DXMAN01_100_1000	Come on... Make up\nyour mind already!
A1_30080_DCWOMAN01_100_1000	All of the Pokémon photo\ncollections are amazing!
A1_30090_DHWOMAN02_100_1000	How about a little snack\nfor you and your partner?
A1_30100_DCMAN01_100_1000	What a neat formation!\nIt’s mesmerizing to watch.
A1_30110_DABOY01_100_1000	Did something happen?
A1_30120_BANEBOO_100_1000	Boing!
A1_30130_DKBUSINESSWOMAN02_100_1000	*sigh*
A1_30140_DABUSINESSMAN02_100_1000	At work they say, “If you don’t know\nwhat to do, just ask Slowking.”
A1_35000_AMAJO_100_1000	(Even my reflection\nis gorgeous!)
A1_35010_YESSAN_100_1000	(Oh, my! Aren’t you just\nthe sweetest friends!)
A1_35020_YOKUBARISU_100_1000	(What a tantalizing smell!\nThose things must be delicious!)
A1_35040_BANEBOO_100_1000	(This booth is fantastic!)
A1_40030_PIKACHU_100_1000	Have you gotten used to using your case notebook?
A1_40030_PIKACHU_100_2000	If you don’t know how to solve a puzzle, feel free to\ndiscuss it with me.
A1_40030_SEL_0_1000	OK
A1_40030_SEL_0_2000	No thanks
A1_40030_PIKACHU_300_1000	We need to find out how the thief managed to steal\nthe jewel.
A1_40030_PIKACHU_300_2000	Examining the crime scene will be critical to figuring\nthat out.
A1_40030_PIKACHU_300_3000	We know the crime took place in the jewel storage\nroom on the second floor.
A1_40030_PIKACHU_300_4000	So let’s be sure to have a closer look at where the\nAurora Drop was last seen.
A1_40030_PIKACHU_300_5000	The thief must have left some evidence behind.
A1_40030_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Don’t hesitate to ask if you’re ever confused.
A1_40030_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’ll help you out whenever you need it.
A1_40050_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey Tim, are you stuck?
A1_40050_PIKACHU_100_2000	Want some advice?
A1_40050_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_40050_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_40050_PIKACHU_300_1000	Is Barnes guilty or innocent? To answer that, what we\nneed is information.
A1_40050_PIKACHU_300_2000	First, try talking to everyone who lives or works in the\nmansion.
A1_40050_PIKACHU_300_3000	And not just humans—that goes for Pokémon too.
A1_40050_PIKACHU_400_1000	All right. Spend some time thinking things over.
A1_40050_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’ll help you out whenever you need it.
A1_40120_PIKACHU_100_1000	Do you know what we need to do to prove Barnes’s\ninnocence?
A1_40120_PIKACHU_100_2000	You can talk to me if you need to.
A1_40120_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_40120_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_40120_PIKACHU_300_1000	According to Ducklett, there was a Cramorant\naround too.
A1_40120_PIKACHU_300_2000	Let’s get Growlithe’s help to search for that\nCramorant.
A1_40120_PIKACHU_300_3000	I’m sure he’ll have some important info.
A1_40120_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Are you sure?
A1_40120_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m here anytime you wanna talk.
A1_40130_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wondering how we can track down the red Pokémon?
A1_40130_PIKACHU_100_2000	If you’re stuck, I can help you.
A1_40130_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_40130_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_40130_PIKACHU_300_1000	First things first—we gotta figure out what this red\nPokémon actually is.
A1_40130_PIKACHU_300_2000	Let’s head into the city and ask around.
A1_40130_PIKACHU_300_3000	And one more thing—that cotton we found in the\nmansion stuck out to me like a sore thumb.
A1_40130_PIKACHU_300_4000	Keep an eye open for any cotton-like Pokémon we\ncan talk to.
A1_40130_PIKACHU_300_5000	One of ’em is bound to know something.
A1_40130_PIKACHU_400_1000	All right. Spend some time thinking things over.
A1_40130_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’ll help you out whenever you need it.
A1_40140_PIKACHU_100_1000	You seem stuck, Tim.
A1_40140_PIKACHU_100_2000	Want some advice?
A1_40140_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_40140_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_40140_PIKACHU_300_1000	Whimsicott said Pawniard’s often at the terrace.
A1_40140_PIKACHU_300_2000	We may be able to find a clue around there.
A1_40140_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Try thinking about it yourself a little more.
A1_40140_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’ll help you out whenever you need it.
A1_40150_PIKACHU_100_1000	You wanna search for Ducklett, right?
A1_40150_PIKACHU_100_2000	You can talk to me if you need to.
A1_40150_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_40150_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_40150_PIKACHU_300_1000	We heard that Ducklett went out to buy coffee beans.
A1_40150_PIKACHU_300_2000	Let’s talk to Pablo at the Hi-Hat Café.
A1_40150_PIKACHU_300_3000	He might know something.
A1_40150_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK, then—no problem.
A1_40150_PIKACHU_400_2000	If you don’t understand something, you can always\ntalk to me about it.
A1_40180_PIKACHU_100_1000	Do you wanna discuss how we should search for the\nPokémon that ran away?
A1_40180_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_40180_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_40180_PIKACHU_300_1000	So, to search for the runaway Ducklett... Let’s see...
A1_40180_PIKACHU_300_2000	Different Pokémon are skilled at different things.
A1_40180_PIKACHU_300_3000	Why don’t we ask the Pokémon of the mansion if they\ncan help?
A1_40180_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Are you sure?
A1_40180_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m here anytime you wanna talk.
A1_40190_PIKACHU_100_1000	You want to look into why the Pokémon were all\nsleeping, right?
A1_40190_PIKACHU_100_2000	Want me to help?
A1_40190_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_40190_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_40190_PIKACHU_300_1000	Hmm... Why were all the Pokémon in the mansion\nsound asleep?
A1_40190_PIKACHU_300_2000	Think back to what Cramorant and the others\ntold us...
A1_40190_PIKACHU_300_3000	Didn’t they all say they got sleepy after they ate?
A1_40190_PIKACHU_300_4000	I wonder if there was something in their food.
A1_40190_PIKACHU_300_5000	Why don’t you check out the Pokémon’s food dishes?
A1_40190_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK then, let’s do it your way.
A1_40190_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m here whenever you need me.
A1_40230_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’re close to solving the case...I can feel it! Think\nyou know who the culprit is, Tim?
A1_40230_PIKACHU_100_2000	If you’re still unsure, I can tell you what I think.\nWhaddya say?
A1_40230_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_40230_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_40230_PIKACHU_300_1000	Denis knows the mansion better than anyone.
A1_40230_PIKACHU_300_2000	Let’s ask him about Growlithe’s food.
A1_40230_PIKACHU_300_3000	Who would have been able to mix sleep powder in\nwith the food?
A1_40230_PIKACHU_300_4000	I’m sure you can figure it out.
A1_40230_PIKACHU_400_1000	Great! I knew you could do it!
A1_40230_PIKACHU_400_2000	Try figuring it out on your own, why don’t you?
A1_40260_PIKACHU_100_1000	Aha! I know the answer!
A1_40260_PIKACHU_100_2000	I wouldn’t mind telling you if you want...
A1_40260_PIKACHU_100_3000	Wanna hear it, Tim?
A1_40260_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_40260_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_40260_PIKACHU_300_1000	The reason we can’t find the jewel is because the\nculprit got a Pokémon’s help to hide it.
A1_40260_PIKACHU_300_2000	What Pokémon works together with Turner?
A1_40260_PIKACHU_300_3000	Knowing all that, I bet you’ve figured it out, right?
A1_40260_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Are you sure?
A1_40260_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m here anytime you wanna talk.
A1_40270_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve got everything we need to make our\ndeductions.
A1_40270_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s solve this puzzle, Tim!
A1_40270_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_40270_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_40280_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve got everything we need to make our\ndeductions.
A1_40280_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s solve this puzzle, Tim!
A1_40280_SEL_0_1000	Yes

A1_40290_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_40300_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve got everything we need to make our\ndeductions.
A1_40300_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s solve this puzzle, Tim!
A1_40300_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_40300_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_40310_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve got everything we need to make our\ndeductions.
A1_40310_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s solve this puzzle, Tim!
A1_40310_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_40310_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_40320_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve got everything we need to make our\ndeductions.
A1_40320_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s solve this puzzle, Tim!
A1_40320_SEL_0_1000	Yes

A1_40350_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_40350_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_40370_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve got everything we need to make our\ndeductions.
A1_40370_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s solve this puzzle, Tim!
A1_40370_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A1_40370_SEL_0_2000	No
A1_9020_TIM_100_1000	Actually, Rachel’s here because—
A1_9020_RACHEL_100_1000	Hello! Sorry to barge in so suddenly. I was hoping to\nget some advice from the great detective here.
A1_9020_RACHEL_100_2000	I didn’t realize his family was visiting, though.
A1_9020_IRENE_100_1000	Welcome, Rachel!
A1_9020_IRENE_100_2000	We didn’t mean to startle you.
A1_9020_IRENE_100_3000	Sophia and I just arrived in Ryme City yesterday.
A1_9020_SOPHIA_100_1000	We came to see my brother’s award ceremony!
A1_9020_RACHEL_100_3000	Oh, really?
A1_9020_RACHEL_100_4000	Then this is probably the first time you’ve all seen\neach other in a while.
A1_9020_RACHEL_100_5000	I really hope I’m not in the way...
A1_9020_IRENE_100_4000	Please, don’t worry about it! We’ll be in town for a\nwhile yet.
A1_9020_IRENE_100_5000	Make yourself at home.
A1_9020_SOPHIA_100_2000	I’ll make some tea!
A1_9020_RACHEL_100_6000	Thank you, really.
A1_9020_PIKACHU_100_1000	See, Tim?
A1_9020_PIKACHU_100_2000	I told you Irene and Sophia would understand.
A1_9020_TIM_100_2000	Yeah, you’re right. I’m glad.
A1_9030_RACHEL_100_1000	It must be nice spending time with your mother\nand sister.
A1_9030_TIM_100_1000	It is, yeah. But hey, didn’t you want to discuss\nsomething?
A1_9030_RACHEL_100_2000	Oh, ummm... Yeah.
A1_9030_TIM_100_2000	Sorry, it must feel awkward to talk about it around\nso many people.
A1_9030_RACHEL_100_3000	No, it’s not that.
A1_9030_RACHEL_100_4000	Chatting with you and your family has actually\nhelped a lot.
A1_9030_RACHEL_100_5000	Trust me—it can wait.
A1_9030_TIM_100_3000	Really? Well, if you’re sure...
A1_9040_SOPHIA_100_1000	So Rachel’s NOT your girlfriend?
A1_9040_TIM_100_1000	Nope, just a classmate. She came by to talk to me\nabout something.
A1_9040_SOPHIA_100_2000	Something liiike...how she’s your GIRLFRIEND?
A1_9040_TIM_100_2000	Sophia, she is NOT my girlfriend!
A1_9040_PIKACHU_100_1000	Attagirl, Sophia! Tim just needs a gentle shove to\nget things moving.
A1_9040_TIM_100_3000	Don’t you start too, Pikachu!
A1_9040_SOPHIA_100_3000	Hee hee!
A1_9050_IRENE_100_1000	You really don’t need to worry about it, Tim.
A1_9050_TIM_100_1000	Huh? Worry about what?
A1_9050_PIKACHU_100_1000	Bringing Rachel home, of course!
A1_9050_TIM_100_2000	Uh, Mom, I think you might be misunderstanding\nsomething...
A1_9050_IRENE_100_2000	I’m making enough food for eight people or so.
A1_9050_IRENE_100_3000	So she can eat as much as she likes!
A1_9050_TIM_100_3000	Oh, you’re talking about dinner... Wait, eight people?!\nIsn’t that a bit much?!
A1_9060_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, where are you going? The gang’s all here!
A1_9070_IRENE_100_1000	OK!
A1_9130_RACHEL_100_1000	Oh, thank goodness. It looks like Pikachu’s recovered.
A1_9130_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, I think he’s OK now.
A1_9130_TIM_100_2000	So, Rachel, do you feel OK talking about that\nproblem you had now?
A1_9130_RACHEL_100_2000	No, that’s OK.
A1_9130_TIM_100_3000	Are you sure? You don’t have to keep it bottled up.
A1_9130_RACHEL_100_3000	I had so much fun with you all that it’s just not\nbothering me anymore.
A1_9130_RACHEL_100_4000	We’ll discuss it next time, OK?
A1_9130_TIM_100_4000	Sure. In that case...
A1_9130_TIM_100_5000	Mind if I ask YOU something instead?
A1_9130_RACHEL_100_5000	By all means! I’d be honored to help a great\ndetective.
A1_9130_TIM_100_6000	Do you happen to know anyone who knows a lot\nabout jewels?
A1_9130_TIM_100_7000	Apparently the jewel that was stolen in today’s case\nwas really special.
A1_9130_TIM_100_8000	I could use some more information to help me track\nit down.
A1_9130_RACHEL_100_6000	Hmm... Well, one of my professors is a specialist in\nmineral archeology.
A1_9130_RACHEL_100_7000	I could introduce you to him if you like.
A1_9130_TIM_100_9000	Really? Could you, please? That would be a\nhuge help!
A1_9130_RACHEL_100_8000	Sure. I’ll sort it out when I get home tonight.\nHow should I contact you?
A1_9130_TIM_100_10000	Why don’t we meet at the Hi-Hat Café tomorrow\nmorning?
A1_9130_RACHEL_100_9000	Sounds good. See you then!
A1_Detective.asset
A1_Q0110_PIKACHU_100_10	I guess actually using the notebook is the best\napproach.
A1_Q0110_PIKACHU_100_20	So, Tim, what do we have to do right now?
A1_Q0110_TIM_100_10	We have to collect testimonies and evidence to figure\nout how the jewel was stolen.
A1_Q0110_TIM_100_20	To do that, we first have to investigate the scene of\nthe crime.
A1_Q0110_PIKACHU_100_30	That’s right! Let’s go check out the jewel storage\nroom!
A1_Q0110_PIKACHU_300_10	We have a few plausible theories—which do you think\nis right?
A1_Q0110_TIM_400_10	From what we’ve seen of the crime scene, we can tell\nthat the jewel case was sliced open.
A1_Q0110_TIM_400_20	After that, the Aurora Drop was removed from the\ncase and taken away.
A1_Q0110_PIKACHU_400_10	Right. And we saw that the jewel case was still locked,\nwhich supports that claim.
A1_Q0110_TIM_400_30	We still need to investigate more to determine how\nthe case was sliced open...
A1_Q0110_TIM_400_40	but at least now we know how the thief got their\nhands on the Aurora Drop.
A1_Q0110_PIKACHU_400_20	Yeah, we’ve made our first step forward!
A1_Q0110_TIM_500_10	Maybe the culprit unlocked the jewel case, then took\nout the Aurora Drop?
A1_Q0110_PIKACHU_500_10	No, wait. The jewel case was locked, right?
A1_Q0110_PIKACHU_500_20	Are you suggesting the culprit unlocked the case,\ntook the jewel, then locked the case again?
A1_Q0110_PIKACHU_500_30	What kinda criminal is that well-mannered?
A1_Q0110_TIM_500_20	Good point... And that wouldn’t explain why the case\nwas sliced open, either.
A1_Q0110_TIM_500_30	I guess I didn’t think that through very well.
A1_Q0110_TIM_600_10	There’s cotton all over the room, right?
A1_Q0110_TIM_600_20	Maybe the culprit hid the Aurora Drop...in the\ncotton?
A1_Q0110_PIKACHU_600_10	...Are you serious, Tim?
A1_Q0110_PIKACHU_600_20	That theory doesn’t explain in any way, shape, or form\nhow the jewel was taken out of the case, does it?
A1_Q0110_TIM_600_30	Huh. I guess not. And if the jewel were here, the\npolice probably would’ve found it during their\ninvestigation.
A1_Q0110_PIKACHU_600_30	If that answer was supposed to be a joke, do us both\na favor and get some better material.
A1_Q0110_PIKACHU_800_10	Did you thoroughly investigate the crime scene?
A1_Q0110_PIKACHU_800_20	There have gotta be some clues still here.\nLeave no stone unturned!
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_100_10	The thief cut open the case to steal the jewel, but\nthey had the key to get into the storage room.
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_100_20	And the only people who have access to that key are\nDenis and Barnes, so it make sense that the police\nwould suspect Barnes.
A1_Q0210_TIM_100_10	If the key hadn’t been used to unlock the storage\nroom, Barnes wouldn’t be under suspicion in the\nfirst place.
A1_Q0210_TIM_100_20	Why would he do that, knowing people would\nsuspect him?
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_100_30	Maybe he didn’t think that far ahead.
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_100_40	In any case, based on what we found at the scene of\nthe crime, we can’t be certain of anything just yet.
A1_Q0210_TIM_100_30	We need to talk to Barnes and the other people in\nthe mansion and hear what they have to say.
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_100_50	Not just the people—the Pokémon too. I’ll interpret\nfor you when we talk to them.
A1_Q0210_TIM_100_40	All right. I’m counting on you, Pikachu!
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_100_60	OK. Now that we’ve got our next steps figured out,\nlet’s start interviewing everyone right away.
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_200_10	We need to interview everyone in the mansion—even\nthe Pokémon! Don’t forget to talk to them too!
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_300_10	All right. We’ve got some useful information. Let’s\nstop for a moment and get our thoughts together.
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_300_20	Based on everything we heard, is there anything that\nsuggests Barnes is innocent?
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_300_30	Let’s review the information we gathered and see\nwhat we come up with.
A1_Q0210_TIM_400_10	We learned that Clefable greeted Barnes when he\nreturned to the mansion.
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_400_10	And Growlithe said she woke up at exactly the\nsame time.
A1_Q0210_TIM_400_20	Barnes and the others only became aware of the\ncrime after that...
A1_Q0210_TIM_400_30	Doesn’t that mean Barnes couldn’t be the culprit?
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_400_20	Barnes was on the first floor when Turner was\nattacked.
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_400_30	That would’ve made it very difficult for Barnes to steal\nthe jewel.
A1_Q0210_TIM_400_40	Hmm... I’m not sure we can prove Barnes’s innocence\nwith that alone.
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_400_40	Yeah... We can’t exactly disclose that testimony came\nfrom Pokémon—no one would believe us.
A1_Q0210_TIM_400_50	It looks like we’re going to need other evidence to\nprove his innocence.
A1_Q0210_TIM_500_10	Mr. Denis himself said there’s no way Barnes could’ve\ncommitted this crime.
A1_Q0210_TIM_500_20	Taking him at his word, doesn’t that mean Barnes\nis innocent?
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_500_10	Tim, uh, are you feeling all right? You DO realize that\ndoesn’t prove anything, don’t you?
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_500_20	Of course Denis thinks Barnes didn’t do it. No one\nwants to believe that the people closest to them\ncould commit a crime.
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_500_30	Our job is to find something that actually proves that\nBarnes isn’t the culprit.
A1_Q0210_TIM_600_10	I’m coming up short... Is Barnes really the culprit\nafter all?
A1_Q0210_TIM_600_20	I mean, he openly admitted that he had access to the\nkey to the storage room!
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_600_10	No, no, no. You’re on the wrong track.
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_600_20	Do you honestly think he’d admit something that\nwould make him look guilty?
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_600_30	Think about this a little harder, will ya?
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_800_10	Hmmm... I don’t think we have enough\ninformation yet.
A1_Q0210_PIKACHU_800_20	Is there something we forgot to ask about? Let’s go\nconduct some more interviews.
A1_Q0220_TIM_100_10	We can’t lift the suspicion around Barnes with\nClefable’s testimony alone.
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_100_10	I think we’re going to need some other kind of\nevidence to prove his innocence.
A1_Q0220_TIM_100_20	But where should we look for it?
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_100_20	Hm... Nothing immediately comes to mind...
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_100_30	At times like this, it’s best to try investigating other\nleads.
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_100_40	We might find a thread somewhere unexpected that\nleads us back to this.
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_200_10	If the current trail goes cold, it’s a good idea to start\ninvestigating other leads—we might stumble upon\nsome new evidence while we’re at it.
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_300_10	Is there something that can prove Barnes’s innocence?
A1_Q0220_TIM_300_10	Let’s think of something that would be convincing to\nthe police as well.
A1_Q0220_TIM_400_10	That note Trubbish found...
A1_Q0220_TIM_400_20	We can prove Barnes’s innocence with that, can’t we?
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_400_10	That’s exactly what I was thinking.
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_400_20	Here’s what the note said:
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_400_30	“Open the window after Barnes leaves. That will be\nthe signal.”
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_400_40	This is clear proof that Barnes isn’t the culprit—and\nthat the real culprit is still out there.
A1_Q0220_TIM_500_10	Barnes had no way of unlocking the jewel case.
A1_Q0220_TIM_500_20	Maybe we can use that fact to prove his innocence.
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_500_10	It’s true that Denis is the only person who had the key\nto the jewel case.
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_500_20	But the culprit cut open the case and stole the jewel.
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_500_30	So the fact that Barnes couldn’t unlock it doesn’t\nreally matter, does it?
A1_Q0220_TIM_600_10	Ducklett only went out shopping. She didn’t go\nrunning off with the stolen jewel.
A1_Q0220_TIM_600_20	That means Barnes has no connection to the crime.
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_600_10	Hold on. Even if Barnes’s partner is innocent, that\ndoesn’t prove HE is.
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_600_30	I think we’re gonna need a different approach.
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_800_10	Hmmm... I don’t think we have enough\ninformation yet.
A1_Q0220_PIKACHU_800_20	It’s really important that we get this right. Let’s take\nour time with it.
A1_Q0310_PIKACHU_100_10	To get close to the truth of this case, we’ve got no\nchoice but to find the Pokémon that witnesses saw.
A1_Q0310_TIM_100_10	Witnesses reported seeing a red Pokémon and\nDucklett.
A1_Q0310_TIM_100_20	I wonder if the Pokémon that cut open the jewel case\nis the culprit’s partner.
A1_Q0310_PIKACHU_100_20	It makes sense to think that, but no such human was\nseen by witnesses.
A1_Q0310_PIKACHU_100_30	Having said that, though, we might learn something if\nwe can find the red Pokémon.
A1_Q0310_PIKACHU_100_40	Let’s head into the city and get some leads on that\nred Pokémon.
A1_Q0310_PIKACHU_100_50	I’m sure we’ll be able to figure out what Pokémon it\nactually is!
A1_Q0310_PIKACHU_200_10	Let’s look for the red Pokémon in the city. It’s also\nimportant that we get information from any witnesses\nwho may have seen it.
A1_Q0310_PIKACHU_300_10	Did you figure out where the red Pokémon is?
A1_Q0310_TIM_400_10	We did find a rock that was covered in slashes, as if it\nhad been cut up by sharp blades.
A1_Q0310_TIM_400_20	Maybe those slashes were made by Pawniard.
A1_Q0310_PIKACHU_400_10	That’s definitely the rock that the Whimsicott were\ntalking about.
A1_Q0310_TIM_400_30	So, if we go to where that rock is, we might find\nPawniard there!
A1_Q0310_PIKACHU_400_20	All right. Let’s take a look around that rock.
A1_Q0310_TIM_500_10	Pawniard and Whimsicott were playing together,\nright?
A1_Q0310_TIM_500_20	If we search where they flew off to together, maybe\nwe’ll find Pawniard there.
A1_Q0310_PIKACHU_500_10	And where exactly did they fly off to?
A1_Q0310_TIM_500_30	To the Denis...residence...
A1_Q0310_PIKACHU_500_20	Exactly... We’re not going to find Pawniard there,\neven if we search the place from top to bottom.
A1_Q0310_TIM_600_10	Maybe Pawniard chewed on the leaves and left these\nrough, uneven edges?
A1_Q0310_PIKACHU_600_10	Pawniard aren’t the only Pokémon that chew on\nleaves, are they?
A1_Q0310_TIM_600_20	That’s a good point... OK, well, maybe when\nPawniard was eating—
A1_Q0310_PIKACHU_600_20	Quit while you’re behind, Tim.
A1_Q0310_PIKACHU_600_30	Any Pokémon could’ve nibbled on those leaves, not\njust Pawniard.
A1_Q0310_PIKACHU_800_10	Hmmm... I don’t think we have enough\ninformation yet.
A1_Q0310_PIKACHU_800_20	Let’s keep looking.
A1_Q0410_TIM_100_10	At this point, it seems pretty unlikely that Barnes is\nthe culprit...
A1_Q0410_TIM_100_20	But then, why did Ducklett leave from the\nsecond-floor window?
A1_Q0410_PIKACHU_100_10	Seems unlikely that it’s got nothing to do with the\njewel theft.
A1_Q0410_TIM_100_30	Finding Ducklett would be the quickest way to\nconfirm that.
A1_Q0410_PIKACHU_100_20	Good call. Let’s head into the city and look for her.
A1_Q0410_PIKACHU_200_10	We need to find Ducklett. Let’s ask around the city if\nanyone has seen her.
A1_Q0410_PIKACHU_300_10	Did you figure out where Ducklett went after she left\nthe mansion?
A1_Q0410_TIM_300_10	Let’s piece together the information we’ve gathered.
A1_Q0410_TIM_400_10	Didn’t Ducklett go to the Hi-Hat Café to buy\ncoffee beans?
A1_Q0410_PIKACHU_400_10	Yeah. Apparently she goes there on a regular basis to\nbuy them.
A1_Q0410_PIKACHU_400_20	Today was one of those days.
A1_Q0410_TIM_400_20	And Pablo said that he handed Ducklett her usual\norder of coffee beans.
A1_Q0410_PIKACHU_400_30	So I guess Ducklett headed back to the\nmansion, then?
A1_Q0410_TIM_400_30	She might be back there already.
A1_Q0410_TIM_600_10	Maybe Ducklett’s been at the mansion this\nwhole time.
A1_Q0410_PIKACHU_600_10	The way the police searched every square inch of\nthe mansion, it’s hard to imagine that they couldn’t\nfind her.
A1_Q0410_PIKACHU_600_20	I think we can safely assume that Ducklett is not at\nthe mansion.
A1_Q0410_PIKACHU_800_10	I don’t think we’ve done quite enough investigating\nyet. Let’s keep asking around.
A1_Q0410_PIKACHU_800_20	If we go somewhere in the city where there are a lot\nof people, we might find someone who saw Ducklett.
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_100_10	We couldn’t get much useful information from\nPawniard...
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_100_20	I think Ducklett is our only good lead now.
A1_Q0420_TIM_100_10	I guess we need to keep asking around, then.
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_100_30	I dunno... Maybe she got scared and went into hiding.
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_100_40	If she did, it’ll be really hard for just the two of us to\nfind her.
A1_Q0420_TIM_100_20	Yeah. How should we look for her, then?
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_100_50	Good question...
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_100_60	How about we ask a Pokémon to help us?
A1_Q0420_TIM_100_30	A Pokémon?
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_100_70	Yeah. Pokémon have all sorts of special skills.
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_100_80	Maybe there’s a Pokémon that can help us find\nDucklett.
A1_Q0420_TIM_100_40	Do you think it’d be willing to help us, though?
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_100_90	I’m sure one of the Pokémon in the Denis residence\nwould gladly help us out.
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_100_100	After all, the theft happened in their own home.
A1_Q0420_TIM_100_50	Good point. Let’s go back to the mansion and ask the\nPokémon there for help.
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_200_10	Let’s ask the Pokémon for help.
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_200_20	We’ve got to find one that has the skills necessary to\nhelp us search for Ducklett.
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_300_10	Have we found a Pokémon with the skills necessary to\nhelp us search for Ducklett?
A1_Q0420_TIM_300_10	Let’s think about the information we gathered.
A1_Q0420_TIM_400_10	Growlithe said she has a good sense of smell, right?
A1_Q0420_TIM_400_20	Maybe we can use that to follow Ducklett’s scent.
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_400_10	We could sniff out Ducklett by tracking the scent she\nleft at the scene of the crime!
A1_Q0420_TIM_400_30	I bet Growlithe could do that, no problem.
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_400_20	Great idea, Tim!
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_500_10	By listening, eh? Hm... Claudia’s Clefable could\nprobably zero in on the sounds Ducklett makes...
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_500_20	But the city is noisy, and we have no idea what\nDucklett is doing.
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_500_30	I don’t think this sound idea is gonna work.
A1_Q0420_TIM_600_10	If we could get Manectric’s help, this would be a\npiece of cake...
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_600_10	Yeah, but Manectric is busy with police work.
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_600_20	I don’t think we can pull him away to help us.
A1_Q0420_PIKACHU_800_10	Let’s look for a Pokémon in the mansion that can\nhelp us out.
A1_Q0510_PIKACHU_100_10	At the exact same time the jewel was stolen, all the\nPokémon in the mansion were asleep.
A1_Q0510_PIKACHU_100_20	There’s no way that’s a coincidence.
A1_Q0510_TIM_100_10	You think someone wanted it to happen?
A1_Q0510_PIKACHU_100_30	I’d say the odds of that are pretty high!
A1_Q0510_TIM_100_20	There’s got to be some kind of evidence we can use\nto prove that!
A1_Q0510_PIKACHU_100_40	Let’s search the mansion, Tim!
A1_Q0510_PIKACHU_200_10	There’s got to be some kind of evidence that the\nculprit left behind in the mansion.
A1_Q0510_PIKACHU_300_10	Did you figure out what caused all the Pokémon in\nthe mansion to fall asleep?
A1_Q0510_TIM_400_10	The Pokémon in the mansion said that they fell asleep\nafter eating breakfast.
A1_Q0510_TIM_400_20	And in one of the food bowls, we found traces of\nsleep powder...
A1_Q0510_PIKACHU_400_10	That leads us to only one possible conclusion!
A1_Q0510_PIKACHU_400_20	Someone deliberately put the Pokémon in the\nmansion to sleep with sleep powder!
A1_Q0510_TIM_500_10	Maybe they all went shopping together and got tired\nand fell asleep afterward?
A1_Q0510_PIKACHU_500_10	Hold on now. Who went out shopping again?
A1_Q0510_TIM_500_20	Uh... Just Ducklett.
A1_Q0510_PIKACHU_500_20	Yeah, and what’s more, she didn’t even make it to\nthe café until AFTER the theft took place.
A1_Q0510_TIM_500_30	I guess that wouldn’t explain why all the Pokémon\nfell asleep...
A1_Q0510_TIM_600_10	Didn’t Clefable say that she was playing in\nthe mansion?
A1_Q0510_TIM_600_20	If Growlithe joined in and they were playing together,\nthen maybe—
A1_Q0510_PIKACHU_600_10	I’m gonna stop you right there, Tim. Growlithe said\nshe was on guard duty, remember?
A1_Q0510_PIKACHU_600_20	Growlithe is a serious, hard-working Pokémon.\nNo way she would’ve tired herself out playing.
A1_Q0510_PIKACHU_800_10	Hmmm... I don’t think we have enough\ninformation yet.
A1_Q0510_PIKACHU_800_20	Why don’t we try talking to the Pokémon in the\nmansion one more time?
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_100_10	Someone managed to get some of Lilligant’s\nsleep powder...
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_100_20	Then, they mixed it into the Pokémon’s breakfast...
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_100_30	Sure sounds like an inside job to me.
A1_Q0530_TIM_100_10	Which means the culprit is someone in the mansion.
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_100_40	Let’s do some more sleuthin’ and find out who!
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_200_10	We should ask about Growlithe’s food, specifically.
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_300_10	Who would’ve been able to mix sleep powder into\nGrowlithe’s food?
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_300_20	Let’s figure it out using the info we’ve gathered.
A1_Q0530_TIM_400_10	The only person who could’ve put sleep powder in\nthe Pokémon’s meals is...
A1_Q0530_TIM_400_20	Turner! It has to have been him!
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_400_10	Bingo!
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_400_20	He’s in charge of preparing Pokémon meals—he\ncould’ve easily slipped it into their food.
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_400_30	However...this fact alone isn’t enough to implicate\nTurner.
A1_Q0530_TIM_500_10	Barnes knows Growlithe’s favorite foods.
A1_Q0530_TIM_500_20	He could’ve slipped Growlithe sleep powder without\nher noticing.
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_500_10	*sigh* Tim...
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_500_20	Sure, I guess he COULD have done that...
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_500_30	but haven’t we already concluded that Barnes ISN’T\nthe culprit?
A1_Q0530_TIM_600_10	Maybe Mrs. Denis slipped Growlithe the\nsleep powder...
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_600_10	Claudia isn’t in charge of prepping the Pokémon’s\nmeals...
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_600_20	Not only that—she doesn’t even eat meals in the same\nroom as the Pokémon.
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_600_30	Do you really think she’d have the opportunity to\ntouch their bowls?
A1_Q0530_TIM_700_10	Isn’t Mr. Denis the one who picks the ingredients for\nGrowlithe’s meals?
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_700_10	Even if he is, it’d be hard for him to actually\ntamper with those meals, don’t you think?
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_700_20	And if there were something wrong with the\ningredients, wouldn’t the Pokémon be falling\nasleep every day?
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_800_10	Hmmm... I don’t think we have enough\ninformation yet.
A1_Q0530_PIKACHU_800_20	Isn’t there someone in the mansion we haven’t\nquestioned yet?
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_100_10	I bet you’ve figured it out too, haven’t you?
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_100_20	All right. Here’s the final question:
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_100_30	Where did Turner hide the jewel?
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_100_40	Once you piece together all the information we’ve\ngathered so far together, you’ll definitely figure it out.
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_200_10	Where did the jewel go... Wasn’t there a scent for\nGrowlithe to follow?
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_300_10	I’ll give you a hint.
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_300_20	The jewel was most certainly taken out of the\nmansion, and a Pokémon was used to do it.
A1_Q0710_TIM_300_10	A Pokémon?
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_300_30	Yeah. Think about the unique characteristics of each\nPokémon in the mansion.
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_300_40	Which one of them has the ideal features for hiding\nthe jewel?
A1_Q0710_TIM_400_10	Cramorant said he could gulp down anything, right?
A1_Q0710_TIM_400_20	So the jewel is most likely hidden in his belly.
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_400_10	Yes! You got it!
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_400_20	Turner made Cramorant swallow the jewel!
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_400_30	And the reason he feels full is because he’s still got\nthat jewel in his belly.
A1_Q0710_TIM_400_30	Turner didn’t have time to retrieve the jewel after the\ntheft, did he?
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_400_40	Nope! I’m positive the jewel is still in Cramorant’s\nbelly!
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_400_50	Now we have enough evidence to back Turner into\na corner.
A1_Q0710_TIM_500_10	You know how Whimsicott are covered in cotton?
A1_Q0710_TIM_500_20	Do you think maybe the jewel could’ve been hidden\nin a Whimsicott?
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_500_10	That’d be a good way to hide the jewel to get it out\nof the mansion...
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_500_20	But afterward? With so many Whimsicott in the city,\nTurner would have no clue where to find it.
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_500_30	I don’t think Turner would do something that would’ve\nmade it harder for him to get the jewel back.
A1_Q0710_TIM_600_10	Maybe Ducklett hid it in that fountain she was near?
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_600_10	So you’re saying Turner intended to have Ducklett\ndive into the fountain and get the jewel later?
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_600_20	Ducklett is Barnes’s partner. I don’t think she would\nhave taken orders from Turner, do you?
A1_Q0710_TIM_700_10	Didn’t Mrs. Denis say she heard a metallic sound?
A1_Q0710_TIM_700_20	Maybe that sound came from the culprit throwing the\njewel into the garden.
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_700_10	Hm... Let’s assume that sound WAS the jewel.
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_700_20	How would Turner find it later?
A1_Q0710_TIM_700_30	Maybe he planned to have Growlithe sniff it out...?
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_700_30	Growlithe is Denis’s partner—do you really think she’d\ndo what Turner says?
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_700_40	Don’t you think he used some other method?
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_800_10	Hmmm... I don’t think we have enough\ninformation yet.
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_800_20	Now that I think about it, wasn’t there a scent that\nGrowlithe didn’t end up tracking down earlier?
A1_Q0710_PIKACHU_800_30	If it’s a scent that leads from the mansion, it might\nprovide some kind of clue.
A1_TUTORIAL_EXPLAIN_PUSH_BUTTON_PIKACHU_100_10	After we’ve collected enough testimonies and\nevidence, the Begin Deducing option will appear.
A1_TUTORIAL_EXPLAIN_PUSH_BUTTON_PIKACHU_100_20	When you select this, we can start deducing the\nanswers to our questions.
A1_TUTORIAL_EXPLAIN_PUSH_BUTTON_PIKACHU_100_30	We don’t have enough testimonies or evidence right\nnow—but once we do, we’ll be able to start deducing!
A1_TUTORIAL_EXPLAIN_QUESTION_PIKACHU_100_10	First, let’s write in the notebook any burning questions\nthat arise while we’re investigating.
A1_TUTORIAL_EXPLAIN_SOLVE_PIKACHU_100_10	You understand how to use the case notebook now?
A1_TUTORIAL_EXPLAIN_SOLVE_TIM_100_10	Yep! Once I’ve got some evidence, I’ll start deducing!
A1_TUTORIAL_EXPLAIN_SOLVE_PIKACHU_100_20	Feel free to start deducing whenever you feel like it!
A1_TUTORIAL_EXPLAIN_SUIRI_GAME_PIKACHU_100_10	You’ve probably figured out how the culprit stole\nthe jewel by now, eh?
A1_TUTORIAL_EXPLAIN_SUIRI_GAME_PIKACHU_100_20	All right. Select Begin Deducing in your\ncase notebook.
A1_TUTORIAL_EXPLAIN_TESTIMONY_PIKACHU_100_10	We’ll summarize the testimony and evidence that\nwe’ve gathered during our investigation on the page\nbelow.

A1_Drama_TIM_100_10	Whoa. That’s a lot of Whimsicott!
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_100_10	Sure is. They ride through on\nseasonal winds every year.
A1_Drama_TIM_100_20	I hear they can be real pranksters!
A1_Drama_ELFUUN02_100_20_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - friendly)
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_100_20	If they get in a house they like,\nthey scatter cotton everywhere!
A1_Drama_TIM_100_30	Sounds like a pain to clean up.

A1_Drama_PIKACHU_200_30	Disguises are a key part of\ndetective work, you know.
A1_Drama_TIM_200_10	Yeah, whatever. Now quit goofing off and investigate!
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_200_35_NOMESSAGE	(disappointed react)
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_200_40	He clearly doesn’t appreciate my art...
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_200_50	Perhaps I need to give him a little more training!
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_200_60_NOMESSAGE	Ah!
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_300_10	’Kay, let’s do this!

A1_Drama_PIKACHU_300_50_NOMESSAGE	(startled yell)

A1_Drama_GARDIE_300_40_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - mild exasperation)\n\[Finally!\]
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_400_10	Hmm... A missing jewel...\nAnd now, Cramorant’s full belly...
A1_Drama_TIM_400_10	What are you thinking, Pikachu?
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_400_20	I’ve figured it out!
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_400_30_NOMESSAGE	Hup! (vocalization while jumping)

A1_Drama_PIKACHU_500_10	Ironic, huh?
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_500_20	Cramorant swallowed the jewel, and now\nyou’ve gotta swallow the bitter consequences.
A1_Drama_HOLIDAY_500_10	Well, let’s go.
A1_Drama_TURNER_500_10	Yeah...
A1_Drama_UU_500_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - struggling reaction)
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_500_30	Cramorant! Are you all right?

A1_Drama_BURNS_500_20	Turner!
A1_Drama_TURNER_500_20	H-hold on! I swear I had nothing to do with that!
A1_Drama_HOLIDAY_500_40	Why don’t we discuss this down at the station?
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_600_10	Growlithe! You did a great job!
A1_Drama_GARDIE_600_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - enthusiasm)\n\[Yep!\]
A1_Drama_TIM_600_10	Hey, Pikachu!
A1_Drama_TIM_600_15	Look!
A1_Drama_ELFUUN01_600_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - farewell)\n\[Bye bye!\]
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_600_20	Oh! Are you leaving already?
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_600_30	See ya ’round!
A1_Drama_ELFUUN01_600_20_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - farewell)\n\[Bye!\]
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_600_40	Say, Tim... Did you notice Cramorant’s back?
A1_Drama_TIM_600_20	Yeah... There was something glowing on it.
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_600_50	I’ve never seen anything like it.
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_600_60	I wonder... Maybe Turner DIDN’T\nknow what was going on.
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_600_70	Something tells me this is just the beginning.
A1_Drama_IRENE_700_10	Eat up, everyone!\nI really outdid myself this time!
A1_Drama_RACHEL_700_10	Wow! Looks amazing!
A1_Drama_SOPHIA_700_10	Thank you, Mom!
A1_Drama_TIM_700_10	Mom made her special mac and cheese for us!
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_700_10	So, this is the dish that Harry kept\nraving about, huh? Hehehe...
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_700_20_NOMESSAGE	(chewing sounds)
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_700_30	Ohh! This is incredible!
A1_Drama_TIM_700_20	Good, huh?

A1_Drama_PIKACHU_700_36_NOMESSAGE	(small inhale)
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_700_40	Ah?
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_700_50_NOMESSAGE	Ahh!
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_800_10_NOMESSAGE	Aaahhh!
A1_Drama_HARRY_900_10	Irene...
A1_Drama_HARRY_900_20	We need to talk...
A1_Drama_IRENE_900_10	What is it?
A1_Drama_HARRY_900_30	I want a divorce.
A1_Drama_IRENE_900_20	What?!
A1_Drama_IRENE_900_30	A-are you joking?!
A1_Drama_HARRY_900_40	Take care of Tim and Sophia for me.
A1_Drama_IRENE_900_40	Where is this coming from?!
A1_Drama_HARRY_900_50	I’m sorry...
A1_Drama_IRENE_900_50	Harry, there must be some reason...
A1_Drama_HARRY_900_60	... ... ...
A1_Drama_HARRY_900_70	I’m sorry, Irene.
A1_Drama_IRENE_900_60	Harry...
A1_Drama_TIM_1000_10	Hey... Feelin’ better?
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_10	Yeah...I guess.
A1_Drama_MEWTWO_1000_10	Pikachu.
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_20_NOMESSAGE	Huh?
A1_Drama_TIM_1000_20	Was that...
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_30	Mewtwo!
A1_Drama_MEWTWO_1000_20	There is something the two of you must know.
A1_Drama_MEWTWO_1000_30	When I was in my cave a few days ago,\nI was attacked by several Pokémon.
A1_Drama_TIM_1000_30	Yeah, we saw on the news.
A1_Drama_MEWTWO_1000_40	No matter how many times I overpowered them,\nthey didn’t seem to feel a thing.
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_40	Maybe...R again?
A1_Drama_MEWTWO_1000_50	No. These Pokémon had no will of their\nown—as if something was controlling them.
A1_Drama_MEWTWO_1000_60	As for Harry...
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_50	Harry?
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_60_NOMESSAGE	Hm?
A1_Drama_TIM_1000_40_NOMESSAGE	Aaah!
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_70	What was... Look!
A1_Drama_TIM_1000_50	Those lights... Like the one we saw on Cramorant!
A1_Drama_TIM_1000_60	You think the two are related somehow?
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_80	I’d say...almost certainly.
A1_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_90	Finding the Aurora Drop may be\nthe key to solving this mystery.
A1_Drama_TIM_1000_70	Yeah. Let’s follow up on that!
A1_Drama_MURDOCH_1000_10_NOMESSAGE	Heh heh heh...
A1_PikaTalk.asset
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_100_10	Hm... What makes jewels\nso irresistible to humans?
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_100_20	It’s a mystery for the ages.
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_200_10	Hey, Tim. I know you’re\nbusy investigating...
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_200_20	but I really want some coffee right now.
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_300_10	Hey, Growlithe. You don’t have to beat\nyourself up over it so much.
A1_PikaTalk_GARDIE_300_10	(But...)
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_300_20	Don’t worry. Just trust me—I’m a great\ndetective. I promise I’ll get it back.
A1_PikaTalk_GARDIE_300_20	(OK! And I’ll help too!)
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_400_10	You really get along with Denis, huh?
A1_PikaTalk_GARDIE_400_10	(Yeah! But not so much with Claudia...)
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_400_20	Why’s that?
A1_PikaTalk_GARDIE_400_20	(’Cause she always ignores me.)
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_400_30	Ah, yeah. I get it.\nBeing ignored really hurts.
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_500_10	Say, Growlithe...
A1_PikaTalk_GARDIE_500_10	(What?)
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_500_20	I don’t seem to be slowing you down\nat all. You don’t think I’m heavy?
A1_PikaTalk_GARDIE_500_20	(Not at all!)
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_500_30	That’s a relief to hear.
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_600_10	Ugh... Sorry, Growlithe, but\ncould you stop for a sec?
A1_PikaTalk_GARDIE_600_10	(Huh? What’s wrong?)
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_600_20	A-all this bouncing up and down\nis making me queasy...
A1_PikaTalk_GARDIE_600_20	(Oh no! We better hurry!)
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_600_30	Hey, don’t move so suddenly—ahhh!
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_700_10	Look, I know we need to hurry...
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_700_20	but would it really hurt\nif we relaxed a bit?
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_700_30	For instance...
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_700_40	Oh, here’s a good idea—
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_700_50	You could listen to some sage advice\nfrom a great detective like me!
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_800_10	Seems like the residents of this\nmansion drink coffee frequently.
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_800_20	I can tell by the aroma.
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_900_10	Y’know, Tim, we’re really living\nthe good life at our apartment.
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_900_20	A huge mansion like this\nmust be a pain to clean!
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1000_10	Hey, Tim. Jessica seems really grateful to\nus for solving the R case two years ago.
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1000_20	Nice to know our hard work\nwasn’t for nothing.
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1100_10	Yo, Tim.
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1100_20	What’s up with you and Rachel, anyway?
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1100_30	Just friends? Reeeeally?
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1200_10	Yo, Manectric! Workin’ hard?
A1_PikaTalk_LIVOLT01_1200_10	(Stay outta my way!)
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1200_20	Hey! What did I ever do to you?
A1_PikaTalk_YABUKURON_1300_10_NOMESSAGE	(Trubbish belches)
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1300_10	D-did you just use Belch?
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1300_20	This is bad! Let’s get outta here, Tim!
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1400_10	So your hands are blades, huh?\nWow, that’s pretty neat!
A1_PikaTalk_KOMATANA_1400_10_NOMESSAGE	(Pawniard extends its blade)
A1_PikaTalk_KOMATANA_1400_20_NOMESSAGE	(Pawniard strikes a pose)
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1400_20	Aaaah!
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1500_10	Hey, Tim! Why are you ignoring me?!
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1500_20	I’m trying to get your attention here!
A1_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1500_30	Seriously!

A1_SRT_PIKACHU_4700_3	The sweet smell of coffee\nis calling my name!

A1_SRT_TIM_4700_15	Did you finally find my dad?!
A1_SRT_HOLIDAY_4700_15	Sorry, no... I’m here on a different case...
A1_SRT_HOLIDAY_4700_20	We’ve received reports of a jewel theft.\nCould you lend me a hand with this one?
A1_SRT_TIM_4700_20	Of course.
A1_SRT_HOLIDAY_4700_30	The incident occurred at the Denis\nresidence—the mansion down the street.
A1_SRT_HOLIDAY_4700_40	Sorry, but Brad is waiting for me. \nI’ll go ahead and meet up with you there.
A1_SRT_PIKACHU_4700_10	So much for my coffee...
A1_SRT_BRAD_300_10	Well, well, well...\nIf it isn’t the “Great Detectives.”

A1_SRT_NONAMEJESSICA_1800_10	Hello there.
A1_SRT_PABLO_6500_10	Well, look who it is!
A1_SRT_RUNPAPPA_6500_10_NOMESSAGE	PKMN cry\n(Hellooo!)
A1_SRT_RACHEL_3900_10	You and Pikachu must\nbe working hard, huh?
A1_SRT_TIM_3900_10	Yeah. He’s actually more\nhelpful than he looks.
A1_SRT_RACHEL_3900_20	That’s pretty impressive, Pikachu!
A1_SRT_JESSICA_4000_10	It is such an honor to meet you, Tim.
A1_SRT_JESSICA_4000_20	Thank you for solving the R case.\nYou have no idea what that meant to me.
A1_SRT_TIM_4000_10	H-huh?! Oh...uh, yeah.
A1_SRT_NONAMEMURDOCH_1200_10	You there! Wait! You wouldn’t happen to\nbe that great detective duo, would you?!
A1_SRT_NONAMEMURDOCH_1200_20	I am SUCH a huge fan of yours!
A1_SRT_MURDOCH_1300_10	Oh! Can I ask you a favor, Pikachu?
A1_SRT_MURDOCH_1300_20	Would you allow me to give you\na quick health exam?
A1_SRT_PIKACHU_1300_10	Ow!
A1_SRT_PIKACHU_1300_20	Hey, what’d you just do to me?
A1_SRT_PIKACHU_1400_10	*sigh* This is the top, yeah?
A1_SRT_TIM_1400_10	Look at that, Pikachu!
A1_SRT_PIKACHU_1400_20	Hm?
A1_SRT_TIM_1400_20	From here, you have a perfect view\nof the Denis residence.
A1_SRT_KOMATANA_1600_10_NOMESSAGE	Pawn!

A1_SRT_RACHEL_2500_20	It’s nice to meet you.
A1_SRT_SOPHIA_2500_20	Is she your GIRLFRIEND?
A1_SRT_TIM_2500_30	Huh?!
A1_SRT_PIKACHU_2500_10	If only...
A1_SRT_IRENE_2600_10	Dinner’s ready, everyone.
A1_SRT_RACHEL_2600_10	Well, I should probably get going...
A1_SRT_IRENE_2600_20	Come now, why don’t you\nstay and eat with us?
A1_SRT_SOPHIA_2600_10	Yeah, that’s a great idea!
A1_SRT_TIM_2600_10	Well, you heard them.\nWhat do you say?
A1_SRT_RACHEL_2600_20	I mean... Who could turn down\nan invitation like that?
A1_SRT_SOPHIA_2600_20	Yaaay!
A1_SRT_PIKACHU_2700_10	Uuugh...
A1_SRT_TIM_2700_10	Are you OK, Pikachu?
A1_SRT_TIM_2700_20	You had me worried suddenly\nfainting like that.

A1_V1_PIKACHU_2000_10	This is it. Let’s take care of business.
A1_V1_TIM_2000_10	Mmhm.
A1_V1_TIM_2000_20	Everyone, thank you for coming.
A1_V1_CLAUDIA_2000_10	This sudden conference\nhad better be important!
A1_V1_TIM_2000_30	It is... We’ve identified the real culprit.
A1_V1_DENIS_2000_10	Have you now?!
A1_V1_TIM_2000_40	Yes... Mr. Barnes isn’t the\none who stole the jewel.
A1_V1_BURNS_2000_10	*sigh* Who did it, then?
A1_V1_TIM_2000_50	I’ll explain everything\nfrom the beginning.
A1_V1_TIM_2100_10	Let’s start with how the culprit\nentered the jewel storage room.
A1_V1_HOLIDAY_2100_10	There were no signs of forced\nentry on the door, so the culprit\nmust have used the key...
A1_V1_HOLIDAY_2100_20	but Growlithe was guarding the key.
A1_V1_CLAUDIA_2100_10	No one but my husband or Barnes could\nhave taken the key from Growlithe.
A1_V1_DENIS_2100_10	Yes, exactly. So how did they...
A1_V1_TURNER_2100_10	I guess it must have been Barnes, then.
A1_V1_TIM_2100_20	No, it wasn’t.
A1_V1_TIM_2100_30	You see, the culprit had a trick up\ntheir sleeve for taking the key.
A1_V1_TIM_2200_10	The culprit used sleep powder\nto make Growlithe fall asleep.
A1_V1_TIM_2200_20	And after that, they took the key.
A1_V1_HOLIDAY_2200_10	Do you have evidence of that?
A1_V1_TIM_2200_30	Of course.
A1_V1_TIM_2200_40	Take a close look at Growlithe’s\nfood bowl, Inspector.
A1_V1_TIM_2200_50	You’ll find traces of \nLilligant’s sleep powder in it.
A1_V1_PIKACHU_2300_10	Are you sure about that?
A1_V1_PIKACHU_2300_20	Just try and remember\nwhat Growlithe said.
A1_V1_DENIS_2400_10	Of course... So that’s how the culprit\ngot into the jewel storage room.
A1_V1_HOLIDAY_2400_10	But they couldn’t possibly have\ncut open that sturdy display case\nin such a short time.
A1_V1_TURNER_2400_10	Yeah, good point!
A1_V1_TIM_2400_10	No, they could have if they\nhad Pokémon accomplices.
A1_V1_HOLIDAY_2400_20	Pokémon?!
A1_V1_TIM_2500_10	The culprit somehow used\nWhimsicott and Pawniard...
A1_V1_TIM_2500_20	and got Pawniard to cut open the case.
A1_V1_DENIS_2500_10	What? H-how is that even possible?!
A1_V1_TURNER_2500_10	Mm...
A1_V1_PIKACHU_2600_10	C’mon, Tim.
A1_V1_PIKACHU_2600_20	What did the Pokémon you\ninterviewed tell you?
A1_V1_TURNER_2700_10	We may understand now\nhow the jewel was stolen.
A1_V1_TURNER_2700_20	But that doesn’t necessarily\nprove that Barnes is innocent.
A1_V1_TIM_2700_10	Actually...
A1_V1_TIM_2700_20	I do have proof that\nMr. Barnes is innocent.
A1_V1_TIM_2800_10	We discovered this note in\na Trubbish’s possession.
A1_V1_TURNER_2800_10	A...a note?
A1_V1_TIM_2800_20	The culprit jotted down their\nwhole plan. They wanted to\nframe Mr. Barnes for the crime.
A1_V1_HOLIDAY_2800_10	Then, that would mean...Barnes is innocent!
A1_V1_DENIS_2800_10	So who’s the real culprit?
A1_V1_PIKACHU_2900_10	You sure about that?
A1_V1_PIKACHU_2900_20	Think about the evidence you collected.
A1_V1_TIM_3000_10	The real culprit is right here with us!
A1_V1_HOLIDAY_3000_10	Wh-what do you mean?!
A1_V1_TIM_3100_10	The thief who stole the\nAurora Drop... It’s...
A1_V1_TIM_3100_20	Mr. Turner! You’re the culprit!
A1_V1_TURNER_3100_10	Who, me?!
A1_V1_TURNER_3100_20	But I’m a victim of this crime!\nPawniard punched me!
A1_V1_TIM_3100_30	It punched you, huh?
A1_V1_TIM_3100_40	Pawniard has blades for hands,\nand I don’t see any cuts on you.
A1_V1_TURNER_3100_30	Ngh...
A1_V1_PIKACHU_3200_10	No, that’s not right.
A1_V1_PIKACHU_3200_20	Based on our deductions,\nthe culprit is clear. Isn‘t it?
A1_V1_TURNER_3300_10	If you really think I’m the culprit,\nthen where’s the jewel?!
A1_V1_TURNER_3300_20	I don’t have it on me, and I haven’t\nset foot outside the mansion!
A1_V1_TIM_3300_10	“Where’s the jewel?” Isn’t it obvious?
A1_V1_TIM_3300_20	It’s with...a Pokémon!
A1_V1_TURNER_3300_30	What?!
A1_V1_TIM_3400_10	Of course you don’t have the\nstolen jewel. You hid it...
A1_V1_TIM_3400_20	in Cramorant’s belly!
A1_V1_DENIS_3400_10	E-excuse me?! Cramorant may be\nTurner’s partner, but even so...
A1_V1_CLAUDIA_3400_10	Where IS that Cramorant, anyway?
A1_V1_TIM_3400_30	Mr. Turner, you clearly put a lot\nof thought into your plan.
A1_V1_TIM_3400_40	But when we investigated the crime scene,\nwe found a Cramorant feather...
A1_V1_TIM_3400_50	and you underestimated Growlithe’s\nsense of responsibility.
A1_V1_TIM_3400_60	Those two things did you in.
A1_V1_TIM_3400_70	Now, please call your Cramorant.
A1_V1_TURNER_3400_10	Urgh...
A1_V1_PIKACHU_3500_10	Let’s wrap this up already.
A1_V1_PIKACHU_3500_20	Who is Turner’s partner Pokémon?
A1_V1_PIKACHU_3500_30	If you can remember that,\nyou’ve got your answer.
A1_V1_UU_3600_10_NOMESSAGE	Cramorant! (Turner!)
A1_V1_UU_3600_20_NOMESSAGE	Cramo? (You called me?)
A1_V1_TURNER_3600_10	Cramorant...
A1_V1_PIKACHU_3600_10	All right, lemme handle this...
A1_V1_PIKACHU_3600_20	Aaah!
A1_V1_UU_3600_30_NOMESSAGE	C-cram! (Eek!)
A1_V1_PIKACHU_3600_30	Whoa!
A1_V1_DENIS_3600_10	There it is! The Aurora Drop!
A1_V1_BURNS_3600_10	And the key to the storage room too!
A1_V1_TIM_3600_10	I’m afraid you can’t talk your\nway out of this, Mr. Turner.
A1_V1_TURNER_3600_20	*sigh*
A1_V1_TURNER_3600_30	I was so close to living the easy life...\nI shouldn’t have teamed up with\nsomeone I barely knew...
A2.asset
A2_0110_TIM_100_1000	Good morning, Pikachu.
A2_0110_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wow, you look awful. Had trouble sleeping?
A2_0110_TIM_100_2000	I couldn’t stop thinking about this whole business\nwith Dad...
A2_0110_TIM_100_3000	I noticed you were out late again last night. I’m\nguessing you’ve been having the same problem?
A2_0110_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, I just needed some alone time—y’know, to\ngather my thoughts.
A2_0110_PIKACHU_100_3000	There’s a lot of strange stuff going on.
A2_0110_PIKACHU_100_4000	We’ve got some shady group collecting meteorites\nand Pokémon, for starters...
A2_0110_TIM_100_4000	Then there’s Cramorant swallowing that jewel, the\nMamoswine that attacked us in the ruins, and those\nBeedrill that were chasing Mewtwo...
A2_0110_TIM_100_5000	They all had some kind of cube-shaped device\nattached to them.
A2_0110_TIM_100_6000	I think today’s the day we look into all that.
A2_0110_PIKACHU_100_5000	And you know what we should do to get more\ninformation, right, Tim?
A2_0110_TIM_100_7000	Yeah. The way these incidents keep piling up, the\npolice are bound to have started investigating the\nsituation.
A2_0110_PIKACHU_100_6000	Right. And the police officer we can trust the most is...
A2_0110_TIM_100_8000	Inspector Holiday. We should go talk to him—that’s\nwhat you were getting at, right, Pikachu?
A2_0110_PIKACHU_100_7000	Spot on.
A2_0110_PIKACHU_100_8000	By the way, Tim...are you sure you don’t wanna tell\nIrene and Sophia about Harry?
A2_0110_TIM_100_9000	Not yet... Not until we know exactly where he is.
A2_0110_PIKACHU_100_9000	Yeah. Good thinking.
A2_0125_SOPHIA_100_1000	Hey, Tim! Do you know any good sightseeing spots in\nRyme City?
A2_0125_SOPHIA_100_2000	I’d just love for you to show me.
A2_0125_TIM_100_1000	Hmm... Nothing’s really coming to mind right now...
A2_0125_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh come on, Tim! You gotta be ready for this kind\nof thing!
A2_0125_PIKACHU_100_2000	What if you had to come up with a few good date\nspots on the fly, huh?
A2_0125_TIM_100_2000	I take it you know a good spot, then, Pikachu?
A2_0125_PIKACHU_100_3000	Of course I do! Personally, I’d recommend the\nHi-Hat Café.
A2_0125_PIKACHU_100_4000	I’ve been poppin’ over there after dinner lately just\nto grab some coffee and collect my thoughts.
A2_0125_TIM_100_3000	Ah, so that’s where you’ve been running off to in the\nevenings recently.
A2_0125_TIM_100_4000	Still, I think Sophia may be a little too young to really\nappreciate the Hi-Hat Café...
A2_0125_IRENE_100_1000	Don’t bother your brother, Sophia. Tim’s very busy.
A2_0125_SOPHIA_100_3000	Okaaay...
A2_0130_SOPHIA_100_1000	Are you heading out again, Tim? Even though we’re\nhere to visit you?
A2_0130_TIM_100_1000	Sorry, Sophia. I’ll make more time to hang out with\nyou. Just wait a little.
A2_0130_SOPHIA_100_2000	You promise?
A2_0130_TIM_100_2000	Yeah, I promise.
A2_0130_SOPHIA_100_3000	Then I guess I can wait a bit.
A2_0140_IRENE_100_1000	I know you’re busy, Tim, but please don’t overwork\nyourself, OK?
A2_0140_TIM_100_1000	You don’t have to worry so much, Mom. I’m not a\nkid anymore.
A2_0140_IRENE_100_2000	Say that all you want, but a mother always worries\nabout her kids—even when they’re adults.
A2_0140_TIM_100_2000	I know, Mom. Thanks. I’ll be careful.
A2_0140_IRENE_200_1000	Don’t overwork yourself, OK?
A2_0140_TIM_200_1000	I know, Mom. I’ll be careful.
A2_0150_TIM_100_1000	It’s today’s newspaper.
A2_0150_PIKACHU_100_1000	What articles are there today?
A2_0150_PIKACHU_200_1000	What’s the newspaper have to say?
A2_0160_TIM_100_1000	It’s time for the morning news to start.
A2_0160_EMILIA_200_1000	Next, we have some heartwarming news. At a florist’s\nshop in the city, a rare flower has...
A2_0160_TIM_200_1000	Hmm... Looks like there’s nothing else about the\nincident yesterday.
A2_0160_PIKACHU_200_1000	I wish the news was always this quiet!
A2_0180_TIM_100_1000	If we want to talk to Inspector Holiday, we should go\nto the police station.
A2_0180_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m ready to head out when you are.
A2_0190_TIM_100_1000	Let’s get going, Pikachu.
A2_0190_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, wait—let’s pay the Hi-Hat Café a visit first.
A2_0190_TIM_100_1500	Huh? Why?
A2_0190_PIKACHU_100_2000	We can interview the customers there, see if they\nknow anything about last night’s incident.
A2_0190_TIM_100_2000	Well, that is pretty important, actually...
A2_0190_TIM_100_2500	This isn’t just an excuse for you to get coffee, is it?
A2_0190_PIKACHU_100_3000	I-I’m not gonna dignify that question with a denial...\nmostly because I can’t.
A2_0195_TIM_100_1000	Well, we’re off!
A2_0195_SOPHIA_100_1000	See you later!
A2_0510_TIM_100_1000	Here’s an article about Professor Gordon.
A2_0510_TIM_100_2000	It says there was a significant discovery at the ruins.
A2_0510_PIKACHU_100_1000	So all our work really helped Gordon with his\nresearch, eh?
A2_0510_TIM_100_3000	Oh, it even mentions me and Rachel!
A2_0510_PIKACHU_100_2000	But not me... I don’t think this article was properly\nresearched.
A2_0510_TIM_100_4000	Awww, don’t feel too bad, Pikachu.
A2_0510_TIM_100_5000	Besides, look! It mentions Darmanitan and the\nothers, too!
A2_0510_PIKACHU_100_3000	Oh, right. Gordon’s looking for their home.
A2_0510_TIM_100_6000	He says that once he figures out where they’re from,\nhe’ll take them back there himself.
A2_0510_PIKACHU_100_4000	That’s really good to hear. I hope they all get back\nhome safely.
A2_0610_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, it looks like someone designed a whole line of\nclothes modeled after the ones Leavanny make!
A2_0610_TIM_100_1000	The Leavanny at the ruins did a great job making\nclothes for Swadloon.
A2_0610_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, those were some quality duds!
A2_0610_PIKACHU_100_3000	I should’ve asked it to make me something as thanks\nfor finding Swadloon.
A2_0610_TIM_100_2000	Oh, really? What would you have requested?
A2_0610_PIKACHU_100_4000	A cape, of course! Don’t ya think every detective\nshould have a cape?
A2_0610_PIKACHU_100_5000	And naturally I’d want it to be real classy, like the one\nI got to wear on that cruise ship way back when.
A2_0610_PIKACHU_100_6000	Y’know, Tim, YOU could always buy me a cape as\na present!
A2_0610_TIM_100_3000	Would I, though?
A2_0620_PIKACHU_100_1000	Here’s an article about the ruins.
A2_0620_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, it’s about the Pokémon murals and statues we\nsaw there.
A2_0620_TIM_100_2000	Speaking of which, why do you suppose there was a\nClefairy statue there?
A2_0620_TIM_100_3000	The others make sense—there were Passimian living\nnear the ruins...
A2_0620_TIM_100_4000	And the professor explained that Aegislash\nsymbolized protection from misfortune.
A2_0620_TIM_100_5000	But why was Clefairy chosen as a statue motif?
A2_0620_PIKACHU_100_2000	Gordon said the ruins were built on a site where a\nbunch of meteorites landed, right?
A2_0620_PIKACHU_100_3000	Apparently Clefairy—and Cleffa, which it evolves\nfrom—often appear where meteorites have fallen.
A2_0620_PIKACHU_100_4000	And remember? We ended up helping some Cleffa\nthat were playing hide-and-seek!
A2_0620_PIKACHU_100_5000	I bet whoever built those ruins also interacted with\nClefairy in some way.
A2_0620_TIM_100_6000	So that Clefairy statue might’ve been—
A2_0620_PIKACHU_100_6000	Yeah. It could’ve been inspired by an ancestor of\nthose little Cleffa.
A2_0630_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, look—a person who’d been missing for two whole\ndays just got rescued by the police.
A2_0630_TIM_100_1000	Oh yeah, I saw on the news that someone had gotten\nlost while hiking. I’m glad they were found safe and\nsound!
A2_0630_PIKACHU_100_2000	You and me both. Says here they were wandering lost\nin the mountains when they came across an Ursaring.
A2_0630_PIKACHU_100_3000	When the hiker’s eyes met Ursaring’s, the hiker got\nscared and took off running...
A2_0630_PIKACHU_100_4000	Wasn’t long before the rescue party found their\nmissing person sprinting full tilt down the path!
A2_0630_TIM_100_2000	Encountering a wild Ursaring when you’re already lost\nwould be enough to send anyone packing...
A2_0630_TIM_100_3000	Still, I wonder if that Ursaring would actually have\nattacked the hiker.
A2_0630_PIKACHU_100_5000	Who knows? You’d have to ask the Ursaring.
A2_0650_TIM_100_1000	Oh, here’s that column that always has interviews with\nexperts from different fields.
A2_0650_TIM_100_2000	This time they’re interviewing a researcher of fossils.
A2_0650_PIKACHU_100_1000	It says he’s been digging up fossils for half a century\nnow—and he’s discovered countless new specimens.
A2_0650_PIKACHU_100_2000	It started as a hobby, but now he’s even founded his\nown fossil museum.
A2_0650_TIM_100_3000	Wow, what a legend... Huh? Wait a second. Is that\nwho I think it is?
A2_0650_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yep. It’s the fossil collector we met at the ruins.
A2_0650_TIM_100_4000	I had no idea he was such a prominent researcher.
A2_0650_TIM_100_5000	Do you think the fossils he found yesterday will be\nadded to his prized collection?
A2_0650_PIKACHU_100_4000	Hey, it was me and Darmanitan who found ’em!
A2_0660_PIKACHU_100_1000	All righty then, what do we got for today’s crossword?
A2_0660_TIM_100_1000	Are you ready? Here’s the first hint:
A2_0660_TIM_100_2000	“This Pokémon has a blocky body and impressive\njaws.”
A2_0660_PIKACHU_100_2000	That’ll be Charjabug.
A2_0660_TIM_100_3000	“This winged Pokémon has adorable eyes and a\nperfectly round body.”
A2_0660_PIKACHU_100_3000	And that’s Rowlet.
A2_0660_TIM_100_4000	“This Pokémon is covered in fluff.”
A2_0660_PIKACHU_100_4000	That’s a real vague hint...but I know the answer!
A2_0660_PIKACHU_100_5000	It’s Eldegoss!
A2_0660_TIM_100_5000	Wow, Pikachu! You solved this almost instantly!
A2_0660_PIKACHU_100_6000	It helps that we’ve solved these puzzles before, so\ndoing it a second time is a piece of cake—especially\nfor a great detective like yours truly!
A2_10100_PXWOMAN01_200_1000	I hope you’ll come see us sing the next time we’re in\nthe city!
A2_10100_PXWOMAN01_300_1000	Thanks for agreeing to help find Gossifleur.
A2_10100_PXWOMAN01_400_1000	Oh dear, oh dear. Where did they run off to?
A2_10100_TIM_400_1000	Hm? Is something wrong?
A2_10100_PXWOMAN01_400_2000	Wait, aren’t you that detective I read about in\nthe newspaper?!
A2_10100_PXWOMAN01_400_3000	What luck! Could you please help me search for\nGossifleur?
A2_10100_TIM_400_2000	Gossifleur... That’s a Grass-type Pokémon with a\npretty singing voice, right?
A2_10100_PXWOMAN01_400_4000	I should have known a detective would really know\nhis stuff!
A2_10100_PXWOMAN01_400_5000	I’m part of a choir that sings with Gossifleur.
A2_10100_PXWOMAN01_400_6000	But some of the Gossifleur went off to play\nand haven’t come back.
A2_10100_PXWOMAN01_400_7000	We need to leave the city soon to be on time for our\nnext performance...
A2_10100_TIM_400_3000	In that case, I’ll gladly help you!
A2_10100_PXWOMAN01_400_8000	Thank you, Detective!
A2_10100_PXWOMAN01_400_9000	If you find the Gossifleur, please ring this bell.
A2_10100_PXWOMAN01_400_10000	It’s the signal we use to regroup, so Gossifleur should\nunderstand that it’s time to go.
A2_10100_PXWOMAN01_400_11000	There are two Gossifleur in total that have gotten\nseparated from us.
A2_10100_TIM_400_4000	Two of them. Got it. I’ll let you know if I see them!
A2_10110_HIMENKA01_400_1000	Fleeeur.
A2_10110_TIM_400_1000	It seems really happy. Maybe it’s glad that its friends\ncame back?
A2_10110_HIMENKA01_500_1000	Fleur! Fleur!
A2_10110_TIM_500_1000	This Gossifleur looks really restless.
A2_10110_TIM_500_2000	It must be worried about the Gossifleur that\ngot separated.
A2_10110_HIMENKA01_600_1000	Fleur!
A2_10110_TIM_600_1000	Is this Gossifleur a little angry?
A2_10120_HIMENKA02_400_1000	Fleur!
A2_10120_TIM_400_1000	I hope I can hear your choir sing next time!
A2_10120_HIMENKA02_500_1000	Fleur!
A2_10120_TIM_500_1000	Oh, there’s a Gossifleur here... It must be part of\nthat choir.
A2_10120_HIMENKA02_500_2000	Fleur?
A2_10120_TIM_500_2000	Umm... I just need to ring this bell, right?
A2_10120_TIM_500_3000	Good. Looks like it’s heading back to rejoin the choir.
A2_10120_HIMENKA02_600_1000	Fleur!
A2_10120_TIM_600_1000	It’s a Gossifleur. What a pretty voice!
A2_10130_HIMENKA03_400_1000	Gossiii...fleur!
A2_10130_TIM_400_1000	It sounds a little sad. Maybe it’s going to miss this city.
A2_10130_HIMENKA03_500_1000	Fleeeur.
A2_10130_TIM_500_1000	Is this one of the Gossifleur from the choir? I’ll try\nringing that bell they lent me.
A2_10130_TIM_500_2000	Yep, it must have been part of the choir. Looks like\nit’s heading back to them now.
A2_10130_HIMENKA03_600_1000	Fleeeur.
A2_10130_TIM_600_1000	It’s a Gossifleur. Seems like it’s just taking it easy.
A2_10140_TIM_100_1000	I rang the bell for both Gossifleur. I guess that means\nI’m done looking for them.
A2_10140_TIM_100_2000	I hope they all reunited. I should go check on them.
A2_10200_YABACHA_200_1000	Nistea sin sin!
A2_10200_RACHEL_200_1000	I’ve never seen an Antique Form Sinistea before.
A2_10200_PABLO_200_1000	Always exciting to meet a rare Pokémon, isn’t it?
A2_10210_TIM_100_1000	Hm? Isn’t this cup kinda...?
A2_10210_YABACHA_100_1000	Nistea nistea!
A2_10210_TIM_100_2000	Whoa! It’s a Pokémon?!
A2_10210_PABLO_100_1000	Hey, Sinistea, stop startling the customers.
A2_10210_RACHEL_100_1000	Wait, is this an Antique Form Sinistea?!
A2_10210_RACHEL_100_2000	Could you let me see under your teacup really quick?
A2_10210_YABACHA_100_2000	Sin sin?
A2_10210_RACHEL_100_3000	Oh, look! There’s a mark! That means you’re a rare\nlittle Sinistea, aren’t you?
A2_10210_TIM_100_3000	What do you mean by “Antique Form,” Rachel?
A2_10210_RACHEL_100_4000	Most Sinistea are Phony Form Sinistea that inhabit\nforged teacups.
A2_10210_RACHEL_100_5000	But every now and then, a Sinistea takes up residence\nin a valuable antique teacup!
A2_10210_RACHEL_100_6000	You can tell if the cup’s a genuine antique by its mark\nof authenticity on the bottom. They’re seriously rare!
A2_10210_TIM_100_4000	Wow, Rachel! You’re not just knowledgeable—you’ve\ngot an excellent eye for detail too!
A2_10210_YABACHA_100_3000	Nistea nistea!
A2_10210_PABLO_100_2000	Looks like it’s happy to receive so many compliments!
A2_10210_TIM_100_5000	It must be able to sense your excitement, Rachel.
A2_10300_POTDEATH_200_1000	Teeeaaa!
A2_10300_PABLO_200_1000	I keep putting it away in the cupboard, but then next\nthing I know it’s right back out on the table.
A2_10300_PABLO_200_2000	Maybe I should start adding tea to the menu, haha!
A2_10310_TIM_100_1000	Say, what’s a teapot doing here?
A2_10310_POTDEATH_100_1000	Poltea poltea!
A2_10310_TIM_100_2000	Wha—?! Something’s in there!
A2_10310_RACHEL_100_1000	That’s a Polteageist.
A2_10310_RACHEL_100_2000	It’s a Pokémon that lives in a teapot.
A2_10310_PABLO_100_1000	Oh, yeah! One day it just showed up out of the blue,\nand it’s been here ever since.
A2_10400_TIM_100_1000	Hm? Is something there?
A2_10400_MINOMUCCHI_200_1000	Bur! Burrr!
A2_10400_TIM_200_2000	Whoa, a Burmy?! That really startled me!
A2_10400_MINOMUCCHI_200_2000	Bur...miii?!
A2_10400_TIM_200_3000	I swear, you can find Burmy in the trees of just about\nany park in the city.
A2_10400_MINOMUCCHI_200_3000	Bur! Burrr!
A2_10410_MINOMUCCHI_100_1000	Bur! Burmy!
A2_10410_TIM_100_1000	I swear, you can find Burmy in the trees of just about\nany park in the city.
A2_10410_MINOMUCCHI_100_2000	Bur...mimiii?!
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_200_1000	I’ll prepare more questions for your next quiz. I hope\nyou’re looking forward to it as much as I am!
A2_10500_DODEKABASHI_200_1000	Canno!
A2_10500_TIM_200_1000	Heh heh... Sure, can’t wait.
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_300_1000	So, Detective, have you figured out the answer to my\nfinal question?
A2_10500_TIM_300_1000	Yes, I believe I have. The answer is Hatenna, right?
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_300_2000	Oh, so you did get it! Well done and congratulations!
A2_10500_DODEKABASHI_300_1000	Cannooo!
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_300_3000	You’ve probably noticed this already, but Hatenna\nprefers areas without a lot of people!
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_300_4000	The emotions of others are constantly flowing into its\nhead, so it’ll run away if it detects strong feelings.
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_300_5000	You have to be very good at emotional regulation if\nyou hope to have a Hatenna as a partner.
A2_10500_TIM_300_2000	It sounds like a really sensitive Pokémon.
A2_10500_RACHEL_300_1000	(I wonder if Hatenna would have appeared there if\nI’d been by myself...)
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_300_6000	Well, that’s all for today’s quiz! Excellent job getting\nevery answer right!
A2_10500_DODEKABASHI_300_2000	Canno!
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_400_1000	What Pokémon can sense emotions via the protrusion\non its head and prefers secluded places?
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_400_2000	Use those legs and find the answer!
A2_10500_DODEKABASHI_400_1000	Canno.
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_500_1000	So, Detective, have you figured out the answer?
A2_10500_TIM_500_1000	Yes, I have. It’s Delcatty, isn’t it?
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_500_2000	Oh! Correct! Was this one a little difficult?
A2_10500_DODEKABASHI_500_1000	Cannooo!
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_500_3000	Delcatty eats, sleeps, and lives as it pleases, at its\nown pace.
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_500_4000	It’s very proud of its fur and prefers to keep it clean,\nso it hates dirty places.
A2_10500_TIM_500_2000	If Pikachu were here, he probably would’ve gotten\ninto an argument about whose fur was glossier.
A2_10500_RACHEL_500_1000	Aren’t they usually nocturnal too? It seems rare to find\none during the day.
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_500_5000	Oh, I see you know a thing or two about Pokémon!\nHow splendid! And now, without further ado...on to\nthe third and final question!
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_500_6000	What Pokémon can sense emotions via the protrusion\non its head and prefers secluded places?
A2_10500_DODEKABASHI_500_2000	Caaanno?
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_500_7000	Those are all the hints you get!
A2_10500_TIM_500_3000	“The protrusion on its head”? What could that be?
A2_10500_RACHEL_500_2000	I guess we just have to check some areas where there\naren’t a lot of people around.
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_500_8000	All right, Detective! Use those legs of yours and find\nthe answer!
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_600_1000	What Pokémon has fluffy fur around its neck, loves to\nstay clean, and lives as it pleases?
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_600_2000	Get out there and find it!
A2_10500_DODEKABASHI_600_1000	Canno.
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_700_1000	Think you’ve got the answer, Detective?
A2_10500_TIM_700_1000	Yeah. This was an easy one—the answer is Lilligant!
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_700_2000	Bingo! That didn’t seem like a challenge for you at all.
A2_10500_DODEKABASHI_700_1000	Cannooo!
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_700_3000	As you can see, Lilligant can make a beautiful flower\nbloom on its head.
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_700_4000	But it requires constant attention! If you don’t take\nproper care of the garland, it’ll wither away.
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_700_5000	And also, essential oils made from Lilligant’s flowers\nsell for unbelievable prices!
A2_10500_TIM_700_2000	Well, I’d already seen a Lilligant before, so the\nanswer just kind of sprung to mind.
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_700_6000	Well, sounds like this was smooth sailing for you, then!\nNow, on to question number two!
A2_10500_DODEKABASHI_700_2000	Canno?
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_700_7000	What Pokémon has fluffy fur around its neck, loves to\nstay clean, and lives as it pleases?
A2_10500_TIM_700_3000	Huh. I’m imagining a luxurious, pampered Pokémon,\nbut what kind?
A2_10500_RACHEL_700_1000	We got a hint about fluff around its neck, but nothing\non where to find it...
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_700_8000	Go on, then! Get searching and let me know when\nyou figure it out!
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_800_1000	What aromatic Pokémon has a beautiful flower\nblooming on its head?
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_800_2000	Come back and tell me when you find it!
A2_10500_DODEKABASHI_800_1000	Canno.
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_900_1000	Hello, Detective!
A2_10500_DODEKABASHI_900_1000	Canno!
A2_10500_TIM_900_1000	Umm... I think I’ve met you before somewhere, right?
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_900_2000	Come on, of course you have! It’s me, the quiz\nprofessor—remember?
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_900_3000	Oh, but where’s your Pikachu? Isn’t he usually\nwith you?
A2_10500_DODEKABASHI_900_2000	Canno?
A2_10500_TIM_900_2000	Pikachu’s got something else going on today. So...am I\ngetting quizzed again?
A2_10500_RACHEL_900_1000	Why not? It’ll be a good change of pace, and I’ll\nhelp too!
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_900_4000	Oh my, is this your girlfriend? Then please, by all\nmeans—you two can work on this quiz together!
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_900_5000	And now for Pokémon quiz question number one!
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_900_6000	What aromatic Pokémon has a beautiful flower\nblooming on its head?
A2_10500_TIM_900_3000	A flower on its head? I feel like I’ve seen that before...
A2_10500_RACHEL_900_2000	Yeah... Do you think it’d be somewhere with lots\nof flowers?
A2_10500_WOMANQUIZ_900_7000	Let me know when you’ve found it!
A2_10510_DREDEAR_400_1000	Lil! Lilligant?
A2_10510_TIM_400_1000	Mmm... For some reason, just breathing in that aroma\nhelps me feel calmer.
A2_10510_RACHEL_400_1000	Yeah, that’s why they even make perfume with\nLilligant’s scent—it’s too expensive for me, though...
A2_10510_DREDEAR_500_1000	Lilli?
A2_10510_TIM_500_1000	Oh, it’s Lilligant! It’s got a beautiful flower and a\nreally nice aroma...
A2_10510_RACHEL_500_1000	Tim, let’s report to the quiz professor—the answer’s\ngot to be Lilligant!
A2_10510_TIM_500_3000	Oh, right! Sure, let’s go.
A2_10510_DREDEAR_600_1000	Lilligant!
A2_10510_TIM_600_1000	Oh, that flower’s so pretty! And it smells nice too.
A2_10520_ENEKORORO_400_1000	Del del...
A2_10520_RACHEL_400_1000	It doesn’t seem to be paying any attention to us.
A2_10520_TIM_400_1000	This Pokémon really does march to its own tune,\ndoesn’t it?
A2_10520_ENEKORORO_500_1000	Del del...
A2_10520_TIM_500_1000	This sure is a cute Pokémon.
A2_10520_RACHEL_500_1000	Oh, that’s Delcatty! It really IS cute! Do you suppose\nit’s going for a walk?
A2_10520_ENEKORORO_500_2000	Delll?
A2_10520_TIM_500_2000	It seems pretty used to humans. Do you think this one\nis someone’s partner?
A2_10520_RACHEL_500_2000	This fur around its neck’s like a fluffy scarf—charming,\nisn’t it? I could keep petting it all day!
A2_10520_TIM_500_3000	Oh, wait! Doesn’t that fit the characteristics the quiz\nprofessor described?
A2_10520_RACHEL_500_3000	Oh, you may be right! Let’s go give her our answer!
A2_10520_ENEKORORO_600_1000	Del?
A2_10520_TIM_600_1000	This sure is a cute Pokémon.
A2_10530_MIBRIM_400_1000	... ... ...\nHatenn...
A2_10530_TIM_400_1000	I didn’t expect to find a Hatenna in a place like this.
A2_10530_RACHEL_400_1000	Let’s not bother it.
A2_10530_MIBRIM_500_1000	... ... ...\n...Hatt?
A2_10530_TIM_500_1000	What a quiet Pokémon. Do you know what it is,\nRachel?
A2_10530_RACHEL_500_1000	Yes, this is Hatenna! It almost never shows itself in\nfront of humans.
A2_10530_MIBRIM_500_2000	... ... ...\n...Hatt?
A2_10530_TIM_500_2000	Well, it is pretty quiet back here in this parking lot...\nI suppose not a lot of people come here.
A2_10530_RACHEL_500_2000	This Pokémon only appears in front of people with\ncalm hearts and minds.
A2_10530_RACHEL_500_3000	I’d say that describes you, Tim—it must have popped\nout to see you.
A2_10530_TIM_500_3000	If you say so... Oh, wait, this Hatenna might be the\nPokémon the quiz professor was talking about!
A2_10530_RACHEL_500_4000	Now that you mention it, it could be! Let’s go tell her!
A2_10530_MIBRIM_600_1000	... ... ...\n...Hatt?
A2_10530_TIM_600_1000	Hm? What’s this Pokémon?
A2_10600_PCMANMID01_400_1000	All right, Pignite! When we get to the campsite,\nyou’re in charge of getting a fire going!
A2_10600_PCMANMID01_500_1000	Oh, Detective! Did you find some Berries?!
A2_10600_TIM_500_1000	Yes, these were growing on a tree in Fountain Plaza.
A2_10600_PCMANMID01_500_2000	Oh, yes! These look perfect for Pignite!
A2_10600_CHAOBOO_500_1000	Nite! Pignite!
A2_10600_TIM_500_2000	You’re right. It looks really happy!
A2_10600_RACHEL_500_1000	Now you can go camping, right?
A2_10600_PCMANMID01_500_3000	Yes! Thank you both so much!
A2_10600_CHAOBOO_500_2000	Pig! Pignite!
A2_10600_PCMANMID01_600_1000	If only I’d checked my bag before leaving home...
A2_10600_PCMANMID01_600_2000	Please get me some Berries for Pignite!
A2_10600_CHAOBOO_700_1000	Pig... Pig...
A2_10600_PCMANMID01_700_1000	Oh dear... Just give it a try, Pignite—please!
A2_10600_TIM_700_1000	Is there something I can help you with?
A2_10600_PCMANMID01_700_2000	Actually, there is. We were about to go camping.
A2_10600_PCMANMID01_700_3000	Pignite here is supposed to help light our campfire.
A2_10600_PCMANMID01_700_4000	But Pignite’s already so hungry he won’t even budge.
A2_10600_RACHEL_700_1000	Awww, poor thing...
A2_10600_PCMANMID01_700_5000	I meant to bring along some of his favorite Berries.
A2_10600_PCMANMID01_700_6000	But I guess I totally spaced out and forgot...
A2_10600_PCMANMID01_700_7000	And I can’t just leave Pignite here while I run home to\nget some...
A2_10600_RACHEL_700_2000	Hey Tim, can we go gather up some Berries for\nthese two?
A2_10600_TIM_700_2000	I’d like to, but do you think we can even find Berries\nin the city that Pignite likes?
A2_10600_RACHEL_700_3000	This city is full of Pokémon! And where there are\nPokémon, there are bound to be Berry trees.
A2_10600_RACHEL_700_4000	But the Berries in the most obvious places have\nprobably already been eaten...
A2_10600_TIM_700_3000	Then I guess we’ll just have to check each tree, one\nby one.
A2_10600_TIM_700_4000	OK. If we find any Berries, we’ll bring them back here.
A2_10600_PCMANMID01_700_8000	That’d be a huge help! Thank you so much!
A2_10610_CHAOBOO_200_1000	Pignite!
A2_10610_TIM_200_1000	You sure look happy. Looking forward to the camping\ntrip, little guy?
A2_10610_CHAOBOO_300_1000	Pig... Pig...
A2_10610_RACHEL_300_1000	The poor fella’s so hungry, he doesn’t want to move...
A2_10610_TIM_300_1000	We’re gonna go look for some Berries for you, so\nhang in there, OK?
A2_10610_CHAOBOO_400_1000	Pig... Pig...
A2_10610_TIM_400_1000	He looks really down.
A2_10620_TIM_100_1000	Oh! This tree’s got Berries in it!
A2_10620_RACHEL_100_1000	Pignite would probably like these ones!
A2_10620_TIM_100_2000	Then let’s hurry and get them to Pignite’s partner!
A2_10620_TIM_200_1000	I never realized there were actual Berries growing on\nthe trees in this city.
A2_10620_RACHEL_200_1000	Just goes to show what a welcoming place Ryme City\nis for Pokémon.
A2_10700_PHBUSINESSWOMAN01_200_1000	I hope Taillow and I can become friends!
A2_10700_PHBUSINESSWOMAN01_300_1000	Oh, Detective! How did the investigation go?
A2_10700_TIM_300_1000	Turns out the voice you heard was a Taillow’s.
A2_10700_RACHEL_300_1000	I think it was crying out because it only just left its\nnest, so it’s lonely.
A2_10700_PHBUSINESSWOMAN01_300_2000	What a relief! Now I know there’s nothing to worry\nabout when I pass by.
A2_10700_RACHEL_300_2000	Oh, but if it’s not too much trouble, would you mind\nintroducing yourself to Taillow?
A2_10700_RACHEL_300_3000	I’m sure if there’s someone checking in on it, it’ll feel\nsafer too!
A2_10700_PHBUSINESSWOMAN01_300_3000	Good idea! I actually just arrived in Ryme City myself.
A2_10700_PHBUSINESSWOMAN01_300_4000	I’ll say hello to Taillow whenever I’m on my way home.\nI hope we can be friends!
A2_10700_TIM_300_2000	Thanks! I bet you two will become friends in no time!
A2_10700_PHBUSINESSWOMAN01_400_1000	It’d be terribly inconvenient if I couldn’t go that way\nto get home...
A2_10700_PHBUSINESSWOMAN01_400_2000	Please, can you figure out where that voice is\ncoming from?
A2_10700_PHBUSINESSWOMAN01_500_1000	*sigh* I don’t know what to do...
A2_10700_TIM_500_1000	Is everything OK?
A2_10700_PHBUSINESSWOMAN01_500_2000	Well, I live on a backstreet just off of Fountain Plaza,\nyou see, and I always walk through the plaza on my\nway home.
A2_10700_PHBUSINESSWOMAN01_500_3000	But now, whenever I’m walking through the plaza, I \nkeep hearing this strange voice...
A2_10700_TIM_500_2000	A strange voice?
A2_10700_PHBUSINESSWOMAN01_500_4000	Yes. But when I turn around to see who’s making it,\nthere’s never a soul in sight...
A2_10700_RACHEL_500_1000	Do you think it’s a ghost?!
A2_10700_TIM_500_3000	Of course not! I’m sure there’s a logical explanation.
A2_10700_PHBUSINESSWOMAN01_500_5000	I hope so. But until I know what that voice is, the\nplaza’s just too creepy for me to go anywhere near.
A2_10700_RACHEL_500_2000	The case of the Ryme City ghost... Doesn’t it make\nyou curious, Tim?
A2_10700_TIM_500_4000	It sure does. Let’s investigate.
A2_10700_PHBUSINESSWOMAN01_500_6000	Thanks for your help—all I want is to feel safe enough\nto walk through the plaza again!
A2_10710_TIM_100_1000	This is where that woman said she heard a\nstrange voice.
A2_10710_SECRETSUBAME_100_1000	Looow...looowww...
A2_10710_TIM_100_2000	Whoa! I really do hear something!
A2_10710_RACHEL_100_1000	Isn’t that a Pokémon cry?
A2_10710_TIM_100_3000	...Is it?
A2_10710_RACHEL_100_2000	Yeah. I can’t quite tell what species, but it’s gotta be\na Pokémon.
A2_10710_TIM_100_4000	Wherever it’s coming from, it can’t be far. Let’s take\na look around.
A2_10710_SUBAME_100_1000	Lowww! Lowww!
A2_10710_TIM_100_5000	Who’s that Pokémon?
A2_10710_RACHEL_100_3000	It’s Taillow! So THAT’S what was crying out!
A2_10710_SUBAME_100_2000	Lowww! Lowww!
A2_10710_TIM_100_6000	Boy, it’s loud. Why do you suppose it’s making so\nmuch noise?
A2_10710_RACHEL_100_4000	I have a feeling this Taillow only recently left its nest.
A2_10710_RACHEL_100_5000	Apparently young Taillow often become lonely and\nstart loudly crying out for their parents.
A2_10710_TIM_100_7000	Gosh... Now I’m kind of worried for it.
A2_10710_RACHEL_100_6000	Don’t worry, I’m sure it’ll be fine—Taillow are also\nknown for being gutsy!
A2_10710_TIM_100_8000	Keep your spirits up, Taillow!
A2_10710_SUBAME_100_3000	Lowww!
A2_10710_TIM_100_9000	Well then, let’s go report what we found.
A2_10720_SUBAME_100_1000	Lowww...lowww...
A2_10720_RACHEL_100_1000	Are you lonely? Don’t worry. I’m sure you’ll be able to\nmake friends quickly in this city.
A2_10720_SUBAME_100_2000	Lowww lowww?
A2_10900_PXMAN01_200_1000	I’ll be sure to keep my ring nice and secure on my\nfinger from now on.
A2_10900_PXMAN01_300_1000	Hi there! This Furret just showed up out of nowhere\nand heroically retrieved my ring for me!
A2_10900_PXMAN01_300_2000	You called it for me, right? Thank you so much!\nIt really saved my neck!
A2_10900_TIM_300_1000	No, don’t thank us—thank Furret!
A2_10900_RACHEL_300_1000	Well done, Furret, really! Thank you from me and\nTim as well!
A2_10900_OOTACHI_300_1000	Fuuurret!
A2_10900_TIM_300_2000	Please be careful not to drop anything that important\nfrom now on, OK?
A2_10900_PXMAN01_300_3000	Hahaha, I’ll do what I can!
A2_10900_PXMAN01_300_4000	I can’t help just staring at my ring. It reminds me of\nhow happy my marriage is!
A2_10900_RACHEL_300_2000	You sound like a really lovely couple!
A2_10900_TIM_300_3000	I have to say, though, I’m pretty surprised that Furret\nwas able to tell what we wanted.
A2_10900_RACHEL_300_3000	I experienced that a lot when I was a kid, actually.
A2_10900_RACHEL_300_4000	Hehe... Maybe it’s a trait passed down from Mama.
A2_10900_TIM_300_4000	Even when we can’t communicate with words, we can\nstill understand each other’s feelings...
A2_10900_PXMAN01_400_1000	How am I gonna get that ring...?
A2_10900_RACHEL_400_1000	It’s almost like he’s in shock...
A2_10900_TIM_400_1000	We’d better hurry and find a Pokémon to help.
A2_10900_PXMAN01_500_1000	Oh no... What do I do?! This’ll be the end of us...
A2_10900_TIM_500_1000	What’s wrong? It looks like something pretty serious...
A2_10900_PXMAN01_500_2000	Please, you’ve gotta help me!
A2_10900_TIM_500_2000	J-just calm down! What exactly happened?
A2_10900_PXMAN01_500_3000	Well, you see, I accidentally dropped my\nwedding ring...
A2_10900_RACHEL_500_1000	Oh no! That really is serious!
A2_10900_PXMAN01_500_4000	I think it rolled into the gap between these buildings,\nbut it’s so narrow I can’t reach down there.
A2_10900_PXMAN01_500_5000	I can’t show my face at home if I don’t get it back!
A2_10900_TIM_500_3000	We can’t fit in a gap that narrow, either...
A2_10900_RACHEL_500_2000	But maybe a small Pokémon could!
A2_10900_TIM_500_4000	Good thinking—a long, slender Pokémon may be just\nwhat we need.
A2_10900_TIM_500_5000	Let’s look around and see if we can find one that’s\nwilling to help.
A2_10900_PXMAN01_500_6000	Please do! I’m done for if I don’t find that ring!
A2_10910_OOTACHI_400_1000	Furret!
A2_10910_RACHEL_400_1000	Oh, look, a Furret!
A2_10910_TIM_400_1000	Do you think this Pokémon would fit inside that gap?
A2_10910_RACHEL_400_2000	Oh—to get that guy’s wedding ring? Yeah, Furret\nwould be perfect for the job!
A2_10910_TIM_400_2000	Let’s ask it.
A2_10910_TIM_400_3000	Hey, Furret, someone lost something important to him.
A2_10910_TIM_400_4000	We could really use your help getting him out of\nthis pinch.
A2_10910_OOTACHI_400_2000	Furret?
A2_10910_TIM_400_5000	Hmm. I don’t think it understands.
A2_10910_RACHEL_400_3000	Please, he’s in a lot of trouble! We seriously need\nyour help!
A2_10910_OOTACHI_400_3000	...Furret!
A2_10910_RACHEL_400_4000	Did it understand?
A2_10910_TIM_400_6000	Even if it didn’t understand your words, your feelings\ncame out loud and clear.
A2_10910_RACHEL_400_5000	I hope so.
A2_10910_TIM_400_7000	The person who needs help is over in Fountain Plaza.\nCan you go help him, Furret?
A2_10910_OOTACHI_400_4000	Furr! Furret!
A2_10910_TIM_400_8000	I think it really did go off to help him. That’d be\nsuch a relief.
A2_10910_RACHEL_400_6000	Come on, let’s go see!
A2_10910_OOTACHI_500_1000	Furr! Furret!
A2_10910_TIM_500_1000	Looks like a pretty nimble Pokémon.
A2_10920_OOTACHI_100_1000	Furret! Furr?
A2_10920_RACHEL_100_1000	Thanks for your help earlier, Furret!
A2_11000_PAMANMID01_200_1000	I hope my kids become good friends with Aipom!
A2_11000_PAMANMID01_300_1000	Oh, you’re the two from earlier!
A2_11000_PAMANMID01_300_2000	Guess what—after you left, an Aipom appeared and\ngot the ball for me!
A2_11000_TIM_300_1000	So it helped you out after all? Glad to hear it!
A2_11000_PAMANMID01_300_3000	Aha! I figured you sent it over!
A2_11000_PAMANMID01_300_4000	It was such a huge help. My kids’ll be so happy now!
A2_11000_PAMANMID01_300_5000	Though I’d better give ’em a stern talking-to about\ntaking care of their things.
A2_11000_TIM_300_2000	Awww, don’t go too hard on them—kids will be kids.
A2_11000_RACHEL_300_1000	Looks like Aipom wants to play with the ball too.
A2_11000_EIPAM_300_1000	Aipo!
A2_11000_PAMANMID01_300_6000	Oh, do you wanna play with my kids? They’d be so\nhappy to have an Aipom for a friend!
A2_11000_EIPAM_300_2000	Aipo!
A2_11000_TIM_300_3000	Looks like you’re happy to make new friends too,\nAipom!
A2_11000_PAMANMID01_400_1000	Sorry to put you through all this trouble. I really\nappreciate it!
A2_11000_TIM_400_1000	Don’t worry about it. We’ll go find a Pokémon that\ncan climb buildings.
A2_11000_PAMANMID01_500_1000	Nnngh, what’ll I do?
A2_11000_TIM_500_1000	Do you need help with something?
A2_11000_PAMANMID01_500_2000	’Fraid so. See that building back there?
A2_11000_PAMANMID01_500_3000	One of my kids accidentally threw a ball up onto\nthe roof.
A2_11000_PAMANMID01_500_4000	But I can’t get up there to retrieve it, so I’m not sure\nwhat to do.
A2_11000_TIM_500_2000	No kidding. I can’t even see that high up from here.
A2_11000_RACHEL_500_1000	Scaling the wall is pretty much out of the question...
A2_11000_PAMANMID01_500_5000	Yep. And the icing on the cake? I foolishly promised\nmy kids I’d have their ball back to ’em by tomorrow.
A2_11000_PAMANMID01_500_6000	There’s gotta be SOME way to get to it. Any ideas?
A2_11000_TIM_500_3000	Actually, I think this calls for some Pokémon help.
A2_11000_RACHEL_500_2000	Then let’s go look for a Pokémon that’s good at\nclimbing buildings!
A2_11000_TIM_500_4000	We’ll see what we can do. Please wait here for a bit.
A2_11000_PAMANMID01_500_7000	Really?! Thank you so much!
A2_11010_EIPAM_400_1000	Aipo!
A2_11010_RACHEL_400_1000	I see the Aipom of Ryme City are as energetic as ever!
A2_11010_TIM_400_1000	Say...these Pokémon are good at climbing trees,\naren’t they?
A2_11010_TIM_400_2000	You think one of them could retrieve that guy’s ball?
A2_11010_RACHEL_400_2000	Oh, that’s a great idea!
A2_11010_EIPAM_400_2000	Aipo?
A2_11010_TIM_400_3000	Hey, Aipom, I was wondering if you could help us...
A2_11010_RACHEL_400_3000	Do you think you could get a ball down from up on\na rooftop?
A2_11010_EIPAM_400_3000	Aipo?
A2_11010_TIM_400_4000	Please, Aipom! You’re the only one who can help!
A2_11010_EIPAM_400_4000	...Aipo!
A2_11010_TIM_400_5000	Oh look, there it goes! I think we managed to get\nour feelings across.
A2_11010_RACHEL_400_4000	I hope it manages to get that ball down. Let’s go see!
A2_11010_EIPAM_500_1000	Aipo!
A2_11010_TIM_500_1000	Hey, Aipom, you look cheerful!
A2_11020_EIPAM_100_1000	Aipo!
A2_11020_TIM_100_1000	Hey, Aipom, you look cheerful!
A2_11100_PABLO_200_1000	Good to see you back, Tim. How’d it go?
A2_11100_TIM_200_1000	Great! Here, take a look!
A2_11100_PABLO_200_2000	Ohhh! What Pokémon did you ask for help?
A2_11100_RACHEL_200_1000	A Machamp popped the lid right off for us!
A2_11100_PABLO_200_3000	A Machamp? Sounds like that stubborn jar lid never\nstood a chance!
A2_11100_PABLO_200_4000	Anyway, I’d better whip you up a little thank-you gift\nwith these preserves!
A2_11100_TIM_200_2000	Thanks very much, but we can wait till another time.
A2_11100_PABLO_200_5000	Are you sure?
A2_11100_TIM_200_3000	Yeah. We’re in the middle of an investigation—and if\nPikachu didn’t get to try some too, I’d never hear the\nend of it!
A2_11100_PABLO_200_6000	True that. Well then, I’ll hold off on making something\nuntil all three of you can stop by together!
A2_11100_TIM_200_4000	Thanks, Pablo!
A2_11100_PABLO_300_1000	Hi, Tim! Have you found a strong Pokémon yet?
A2_11100_TIM_300_1000	Sorry, I’m still looking.
A2_11100_PABLO_300_2000	No problem. I’m not in a rush or anything, so take all\nthe time you need!
A2_11100_PABLO_400_1000	Hi, Tim! Welcome!
A2_11100_PABLO_400_2000	Perfect timing, actually! I’ve got a favor to ask.
A2_11100_TIM_400_1000	How can I help?
A2_11100_PABLO_400_3000	I can’t get the lid off this jar. Could you please open\nit for me?
A2_11100_TIM_400_2000	Sure, if that’s all you need...
A2_11100_TIM_400_2500	Huh? The lid won’t budge...
A2_11100_PABLO_400_4000	No good, eh? It was worth a shot.
A2_11100_PABLO_400_5000	I ordered some gourmet preserves to use in my\ncooking, but I guess you could say I’m...in a jam.
A2_11100_RACHEL_400_1000	A strong Pokémon might be able to help open it.
A2_11100_TIM_400_3000	Yeah, I think you’re onto something there.
A2_11100_PABLO_400_6000	Can you think of any Pokémon in the area strong\nenough to open an especially stubborn jar lid?
A2_11100_TIM_400_4000	Not off the top of my head, but I can keep an eye\nout for one.
A2_11100_PABLO_400_7000	Thanks, Tim! Go ahead and take the jar with you.
A2_11110_PAMAN01_200_1000	Machamp and I voluntarily patrol the area.
A2_11110_PAMAN01_200_2000	After all, there have been so many incidents lately!
A2_11110_TIM_200_1000	What a coincidence. We’re actually investigating\nthose incidents ourselves.
A2_11110_PAMAN01_200_3000	Oh, that’s great! Let’s all do our best to keep our\ncommunity safe!
A2_11110_PAMAN01_300_1000	Good evening, Detective.
A2_11110_PAMAN01_300_2000	Have you come to check out my awesome Machamp?\nI’m so proud of him!
A2_11110_TIM_300_1000	Uh... Not exactly...
A2_11110_TIM_300_2000	Now that you mention it, though, those muscles really\nare something to be proud of!
A2_11110_PAMAN01_400_1000	Just look at my Machamp! Aren’t his muscles a sight\nto behold?
A2_11110_KAIRIKY_500_1000	Champ! Cha-champ!
A2_11110_RACHEL_500_1000	He sure looks strong.
A2_11110_TIM_500_1000	Oh, maybe he can help out with our problem!
A2_11110_TIM_500_2000	See, we’ve been looking for a Pokémon that can open\nup this jar of jam.
A2_11110_PAMAN01_500_1000	Oh, that’ll be a piece of cake! I mean, it’s jam,\nbut...you get the idea.
A2_11110_PAMAN01_500_2000	Give it a twist, Machamp!
A2_11110_KAIRIKY_500_2000	Champ! Cha-cha-champ!
A2_11110_RACHEL_500_2000	Wow, great job! He opened the jar like it was nothing!
A2_11110_PAMAN01_500_3000	Hahaha, a little thing like that isn’t even a warmup\nfor my superpowered partner!
A2_11110_TIM_500_3000	Thanks a lot! We’ve gotta get this back to Pablo!
A2_11110_TIM_700_1000	He certainly looks extremely strong.
A2_11120_KAIRIKY_200_1000	Champ! Champ!
A2_11120_RACHEL_200_1000	Having this Pokémon as a partner must be\nreally handy!
A2_11120_TIM_200_1000	Uh, yeah... Maybe...
A2_11120_KAIRIKY_400_1000	Champ! Cha-champ!
A2_11120_RACHEL_400_1000	Wow, check out those muscles!
A2_11120_KAIRIKY_500_1000	Champ! Cha-champ!
A2_11120_RACHEL_500_1000	He sure looks strong.
A2_11120_PAMAN01_500_1000	Have you come to check out my awesome Machamp?\nI’m so proud of him!
A2_11120_TIM_500_1000	Uh... Not exactly...
A2_11120_TIM_500_2000	Oh, maybe he can help out with our problem!
A2_11120_TIM_500_3000	See, we’ve been looking for a Pokémon that can open\nup this jar of jam.
A2_11120_PAMAN01_500_2000	Oh, that’ll be a piece of cake! I mean, it’s jam,\nbut...you get the idea.
A2_11120_PAMAN01_500_3000	Give it a twist, Machamp!
A2_11120_KAIRIKY_500_2000	Champ! Cha-cha-champ!
A2_11120_RACHEL_500_2000	Wow, great job! He opened the jar like it was nothing!
A2_11120_PAMAN01_500_4000	Hahaha, a little thing like that isn’t even a warmup\nfor my superpowered partner!
A2_11120_TIM_500_4000	Thanks a lot! We’ve gotta get this back to Pablo!
A2_1120_PIKACHU_100_1000	Must’ve fallen asleep at some point...
A2_1120_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hmm... I remember Brad and his goons putting me in\nthe police car...
A2_1120_PIKACHU_100_3000	Which means this must be the police station... If this is\nsomeone’s idea of a joke, it’s not very funny.
A2_1120_PIKACHU_100_4000	I can’t believe a great detective like me would\nactually be locked up behind bars...
A2_1120_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(Hey! Quit that muttering, newbie!)
A2_1120_GORONDA_100_1000	(... ... ...)
A2_1120_PIKACHU_100_5000	Great... Guess I can’t expect a warm welcome from\nmy new roommates, either...
A2_1120_PIKACHU_100_6000	I’ve landed myself in a real mess, that’s for sure.
A2_1120_PIKACHU_100_10000	Ah, well... Let’s see what my new roomies can tell me.
A2_1140_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey there, buddy. Can I ask you some questions?
A2_1140_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(I ain’t your buddy, newbie—and I ain’t wastin’ time\nmakin’ small talk with you, either.)
A2_1140_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh come on, don’t be like that. I’m still trying to get\nmy bearings.
A2_1140_PIKACHU_100_3000	I mean, I don’t even know why I was brought here.
A2_1140_YAMIRAMI_100_2000	(Heh. Suuuuure you don’t. You musta done somethin’\nbad to end up here.)
A2_1140_PIKACHU_100_4000	Something bad? Me? I’m the great Detective Pikachu!\nI would never!
A2_1140_YAMIRAMI_100_3000	(A “great” detective? You? Bahahaha! Now that’s a\ngood one!)
A2_1140_PIKACHU_100_5000	That wasn’t a joke...
A2_1140_YAMIRAMI_100_4000	(Well, Mister “Great Detective,” lemme give ya some\nfree advice.)
A2_1140_YAMIRAMI_100_5000	(You may have been some big-shot detective out\nthere, but in here? You’re just “newbie.”)
A2_1140_YAMIRAMI_100_6000	(And newbies don’t run their mouths, got it?)
A2_1140_PIKACHU_100_6000	Well, that’s that I guess... I don’t think I’ll be getting\nmuch more outta him.
A2_1140_YAMIRAMI_200_1000	(I ain’t wastin’ my time talkin’ to a newbie like you!\nScram!)
A2_1160_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, you got a minute?
A2_1160_GORONDA_100_1000	(You must be the newbie.)
A2_1160_PIKACHU_100_2000	So I’m told. I was hoping to learn more about\nthis place...
A2_1160_GORONDA_100_2000	(... ... ...)
A2_1160_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hey, are you even listening to me? Hellooo?
A2_1160_GORONDA_100_3000	(...Keep it down in the detainment room.)
A2_1160_PIKACHU_100_4000	The detainment room? You mean where we are now?
A2_1160_GORONDA_100_4000	(... ... ...)
A2_1160_PIKACHU_100_5000	Great. Just ignore me, why don’t you.
A2_1160_PIKACHU_100_6000	Well, at least I learned what this room is called,\nwhich is nice.
A2_1160_GORONDA_200_1000	(I told you to keep it down.)
A2_1170_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeesh. Can’t even get a straight answer outta the\nPokémon here.
A2_1170_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hmm... That puts me in a bit of a pickle.\nHow am I supposed to find out what’s going on?
A2_1170_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hm? What’s happening?
A2_1200_PIKACHU_100_1000	Is this...the roof?
A2_1200_PIKACHU_100_2000	Why did I come up here?
A2_1200_PIKACHU_100_3000	Today just keeps getting weirder and weirder...
A2_1200_PIKACHU_100_4000	Guess I’ll ask the other Pokémon what’s going on.
A2_1210_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(Didn’t I tell you to zip it? Stop talkin’ to me like\nwe’re pals, newbie—’cause we ain’t.)
A2_1210_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh come on, no need to be so standoffish. I’m just\ntrying to ask a few questions.
A2_1210_PIKACHU_100_2000	Weren’t we inside a room just now? Why are we up\nhere on the roof?
A2_1210_YAMIRAMI_100_2000	(Beats me.)
A2_1210_YAMIRAMI_100_3000	(Don’t try anything funny, if you know what’s good\nfor you.)
A2_1210_YAMIRAMI_200_1000	(Stop talkin’ to me like we’re pals, newbie.)
A2_12100_PXWOMAN01_200_1000	I hope you’ll come see us sing the next time we’re in\nthe city!
A2_12100_PXWOMAN01_300_1000	Thanks for agreeing to help find Gossifleur.
A2_12100_PXWOMAN01_400_1000	Oh dear, oh dear. Where did they run off to?
A2_12100_TIM_400_1000	Hm? Is something wrong?
A2_12100_PXWOMAN01_400_2000	Wait, aren’t you that detective I read about in\nthe newspaper?!
A2_12100_PXWOMAN01_400_3000	What luck! Could you please help me search for\nGossifleur?
A2_12100_TIM_400_2000	Gossifleur... That’s a Grass-type Pokémon with a\npretty singing voice, right?
A2_12100_PXWOMAN01_400_4000	I should have known a detective would really know\nhis stuff!
A2_12100_PXWOMAN01_400_5000	I’m part of a choir that sings with Gossifleur.
A2_12100_PXWOMAN01_400_6000	But some of the Gossifleur went off to play\nand haven’t come back.
A2_12100_PXWOMAN01_400_7000	We need to leave the city soon to be on time for our\nnext performance...
A2_12100_TIM_400_3000	In that case, I’ll gladly help you!
A2_12100_PXWOMAN01_400_8000	Thank you, Detective!
A2_12100_PXWOMAN01_400_9000	If you find the Gossifleur, please ring this bell.
A2_12100_PXWOMAN01_400_10000	It’s the signal we use to regroup, so Gossifleur should\nunderstand that it’s time to go.
A2_12100_PXWOMAN01_400_11000	There are two Gossifleur in total that have gotten\nseparated from us.
A2_12100_TIM_400_4000	Two of them. Got it. I’ll let you know if I see them!
A2_12110_HIMENKA01_400_1000	Fleeeur.
A2_12110_TIM_400_1000	It seems really happy. Maybe it’s glad that its friends\ncame back?
A2_12110_HIMENKA01_500_1000	Fleur! Fleur!
A2_12110_TIM_500_1000	This Gossifleur looks really restless.
A2_12110_TIM_500_2000	It must be worried about the Gossifleur that\ngot separated.
A2_12110_HIMENKA01_600_1000	Fleur!
A2_12110_TIM_600_1000	Is this Gossifleur a little angry?
A2_12120_HIMENKA02_400_1000	Fleur!
A2_12120_TIM_400_1000	I hope I can hear your choir sing next time!
A2_12120_HIMENKA02_500_1000	Fleur!
A2_12120_TIM_500_1000	Oh, there’s a Gossifleur here... It must be part of\nthat choir.
A2_12120_HIMENKA02_500_2000	Fleur?
A2_12120_TIM_500_2000	Umm... I just need to ring this bell, right?
A2_12120_TIM_500_3000	Good. Looks like it’s heading back to rejoin the choir.
A2_12120_HIMENKA02_600_1000	Fleur!
A2_12120_TIM_600_1000	It’s a Gossifleur. What a pretty voice!
A2_12130_HIMENKA03_400_1000	Gossiii...fleur!
A2_12130_TIM_400_1000	It sounds a little sad. Maybe it’s going to miss this city.
A2_12130_HIMENKA03_500_1000	Fleeeur.
A2_12130_TIM_500_1000	Is this one of the Gossifleur from the choir? I’ll try\nringing that bell they lent me.
A2_12130_TIM_500_2000	Yep, it must have been part of the choir. Looks like\nit’s heading back to them now.
A2_12130_HIMENKA03_600_1000	Fleeeur.
A2_12130_TIM_600_1000	It’s a Gossifleur. Seems like it’s just taking it easy.
A2_12140_TIM_100_1000	I rang the bell for both Gossifleur. I guess that means\nI’m done looking for them.
A2_12140_TIM_100_2000	I hope they all reunited. I should go check on them.
A2_1220_GORONDA_100_1000	(Wait...haven’t I seen you somewhere before?)
A2_1220_PIKACHU_100_1000	Maybe on TV? I’m a famous great detective, after all.
A2_1220_GORONDA_100_2000	(...Great detective? Hmm...)
A2_1220_GORONDA_200_1000	(Great detective... Great detective... Hmmm...)
A2_1220_PIKACHU_200_1000	Is that really something you need to think so hard\nabout?
A2_12200_YABACHA_200_1000	Tea! Sinsin!
A2_12200_RACHEL_200_1000	I’ve never seen an Antique Form Sinistea before.
A2_12200_PABLO_200_1000	Always exciting to meet a rare Pokémon, isn’t it?
A2_12210_TIM_100_1000	Hm? Isn’t this cup kinda...?
A2_12210_YABACHA_100_1000	Nistea nistea!
A2_12210_TIM_100_2000	Whoa! It’s a Pokémon?!
A2_12210_PABLO_100_1000	Hey, Sinistea, stop startling the customers.
A2_12210_RACHEL_100_1000	Wait, is this an Antique Form Sinistea?!
A2_12210_RACHEL_100_2000	Could you let me see under your teacup really quick?
A2_12210_YABACHA_100_2000	Sin sin?
A2_12210_RACHEL_100_3000	Oh, look! There’s a mark! That means you’re a rare\nlittle Sinistea, aren’t you?
A2_12210_TIM_100_3000	What do you mean by “Antique Form,” Rachel?
A2_12210_RACHEL_100_4000	Most Sinistea are Phony Form Sinistea that inhabit\nforged teacups.
A2_12210_RACHEL_100_5000	But every now and then, a Sinistea takes up residence\nin a valuable antique teacup!
A2_12210_RACHEL_100_6000	You can tell if the cup’s a genuine antique by its mark\nof authenticity on the bottom. They’re seriously rare!
A2_12210_TIM_100_4000	Wow, Rachel! You’re not just knowledgeable—you’ve\ngot an excellent eye for detail too!
A2_12210_YABACHA_100_3000	Nistea nistea!
A2_12210_PABLO_100_2000	Looks like it’s happy to receive so many compliments!
A2_12210_TIM_100_5000	It must be able to sense your excitement, Rachel.
A2_12300_POTDEATH_200_1000	Teeeaaa!
A2_12300_PABLO_200_1000	I keep putting it away in the cupboard, but then next\nthing I know it’s right back out on the table.
A2_12300_PABLO_200_2000	Maybe I should start adding tea to the menu, haha!
A2_12310_TIM_100_1000	Say, what’s a teapot doing here?
A2_12310_POTDEATH_100_1000	Poltea poltea!
A2_12310_TIM_100_2000	Wha—?! Something’s in there!
A2_12310_RACHEL_100_1000	That’s a Polteageist.
A2_12310_RACHEL_100_2000	It’s a Pokémon that lives in a teapot.
A2_12310_PABLO_100_1000	Oh, yeah! One day it just showed up out of the blue,\nand it’s been here ever since.
A2_1240_BEROBA_100_1000	(Hiya! I’ve never seen you around before! You new or\nsomething?)
A2_1240_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, I just got nabbed a little bit ago. Have you\nbeen here a long time?
A2_1240_BEROBA_100_2000	(Nah, I’m pretty new too! Been here longer than you,\nthough!)
A2_1240_PIKACHU_100_2000	And that matters why, exactly?
A2_1240_BEROBA_100_3000	(Because the longer you’ve been here, the higher you\nare on the ladder!)
A2_1240_BEROBA_200_1000	(You’d better keep a low profile since you’re just a\nnewbie and all!)
A2_12400_TIM_100_1000	Hm? Is something there?
A2_12400_MINOMUCCHI_200_1000	Bur! Burrr!
A2_12400_TIM_200_2000	Whoa, a Burmy?! That really startled me!
A2_12400_MINOMUCCHI_200_2000	Bur...miii?!
A2_12400_TIM_200_3000	I swear, you can find Burmy in the trees of just about\nany park in the city.
A2_12400_MINOMUCCHI_200_3000	Bur! Burrr!
A2_12410_MINOMUCCHI_100_1000	Bur! Burmy!
A2_12410_TIM_100_1000	I swear, you can find Burmy in the trees of just about\nany park in the city.
A2_12410_MINOMUCCHI_100_2000	Bur...mimiii?!
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_200_1000	I’ll prepare more questions for your next quiz. I hope\nyou’re looking forward to it as much as I am!
A2_12500_DODEKABASHI_200_1000	Canno!
A2_12500_TIM_200_1000	Heh heh... Sure, can’t wait.
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_300_1000	So, Detective, have you figured out the answer to my\nfinal question?
A2_12500_TIM_300_1000	Yes, I believe I have. The answer is Hatenna, right?
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_300_2000	Oh, so you did get it! Well done and congratulations!
A2_12500_DODEKABASHI_300_1000	Cannooo!
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_300_3000	You’ve probably noticed this already, but Hatenna\nprefers areas without a lot of people!
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_300_4000	The emotions of others are constantly flowing into its\nhead, so it’ll run away if it detects strong feelings.
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_300_5000	You have to be very good at emotional regulation if\nyou hope to have a Hatenna as a partner.
A2_12500_TIM_300_2000	It sounds like a really sensitive Pokémon.
A2_12500_RACHEL_300_1000	(I wonder if Hatenna would have appeared there if\nI’d been by myself...)
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_300_6000	Well, that’s all for today’s quiz! Excellent job getting\nevery answer right!
A2_12500_DODEKABASHI_300_2000	Canno!
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_400_1000	What Pokémon can sense emotions via the protrusion\non its head and prefers secluded places?
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_400_2000	Use those legs and find the answer!
A2_12500_DODEKABASHI_400_1000	Canno.
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_500_1000	So, Detective, have you figured out the answer?
A2_12500_TIM_500_1000	Yes, I have. It’s Delcatty, isn’t it?
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_500_2000	Oh! Correct! Was this one a little difficult?
A2_12500_DODEKABASHI_500_1000	Cannooo!
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_500_3000	Delcatty eats, sleeps, and lives as it pleases, at its\nown pace.
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_500_4000	It’s very proud of its fur and prefers to keep it clean,\nso it hates dirty places.
A2_12500_TIM_500_2000	If Pikachu were here, he probably would’ve gotten\ninto an argument about whose fur was glossier.
A2_12500_RACHEL_500_1000	Aren’t they usually nocturnal too? It seems rare to find\none during the day.
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_500_5000	Oh, I see you know a thing or two about Pokémon!\nHow splendid! And now, without further ado...on to\nthe third and final question!
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_500_6000	What Pokémon can sense emotions via the protrusion\non its head and prefers secluded places?
A2_12500_DODEKABASHI_500_2000	Caaanno?
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_500_7000	Those are all the hints you get!
A2_12500_TIM_500_3000	“The protrusion on its head”? What could that be?
A2_12500_RACHEL_500_2000	I guess we just have to check some areas where there\naren’t a lot of people around.
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_500_8000	All right, Detective! Use those legs of yours and find\nthe answer!
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_600_1000	What Pokémon has fluffy fur around its neck, loves to\nstay clean, and lives as it pleases?
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_600_2000	Get out there and find it!
A2_12500_DODEKABASHI_600_1000	Canno.
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_700_1000	Think you’ve got the answer, Detective?
A2_12500_TIM_700_1000	Yeah. This was an easy one—the answer is Lilligant!
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_700_2000	Bingo! That didn’t seem like a challenge for you at all.
A2_12500_DODEKABASHI_700_1000	Cannooo!
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_700_3000	As you can see, Lilligant can make a beautiful flower\nbloom on its head.
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_700_4000	But it requires constant attention! If you don’t take\nproper care of the garland, it’ll wither away.
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_700_5000	And also, essential oils made from Lilligant’s flowers\nsell for unbelievable prices!
A2_12500_TIM_700_2000	Well, I’d already seen a Lilligant before, so the\nanswer just kind of sprung to mind.
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_700_6000	Well, sounds like this was smooth sailing for you, then!\nNow, on to question number two!
A2_12500_DODEKABASHI_700_2000	Canno?
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_700_7000	What Pokémon has fluffy fur around its neck, loves to\nstay clean, and lives as it pleases?
A2_12500_TIM_700_3000	Huh. I’m imagining a luxurious, pampered Pokémon,\nbut what kind?
A2_12500_RACHEL_700_1000	We got a hint about fluff around its neck, but nothing\non where to find it...
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_700_8000	Go on, then! Get searching and let me know when\nyou figure it out!
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_800_1000	What aromatic Pokémon has a beautiful flower\nblooming on its head?
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_800_2000	Come back and tell me when you find it!
A2_12500_DODEKABASHI_800_1000	Canno.
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_900_1000	Good evening, Detective!
A2_12500_DODEKABASHI_900_1000	Canno!
A2_12500_TIM_900_1000	Umm... I think I’ve met you before somewhere, right?
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_900_2000	Come on, of course you have! It’s me, the quiz\nprofessor—remember?
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_900_3000	Oh, but where’s your Pikachu? Isn’t he usually\nwith you?
A2_12500_DODEKABASHI_900_2000	Canno?
A2_12500_TIM_900_2000	Pikachu’s got something else going on today. So...am I\ngetting quizzed again?
A2_12500_RACHEL_900_1000	Why not? It’ll be a good change of pace, and I’ll\nhelp too!
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_900_4000	Oh my, is this your girlfriend? Then please, by all\nmeans—you two can work on this quiz together!
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_900_5000	And now for Pokémon quiz question number one!
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_900_6000	What aromatic Pokémon has a beautiful flower\nblooming on its head?
A2_12500_TIM_900_3000	A flower on its head? I feel like I’ve seen that before...
A2_12500_RACHEL_900_2000	Yeah... Do you think it’d be somewhere with lots\nof flowers?
A2_12500_WOMANQUIZ_900_7000	Let me know when you’ve found it!
A2_12510_DREDEAR_400_1000	Lil! Lilligant?
A2_12510_TIM_400_1000	Mmm... For some reason, just breathing in that aroma\nhelps me feel calmer.
A2_12510_RACHEL_400_1000	Yeah, that’s why they even make perfume with\nLilligant’s scent—it’s too expensive for me, though...
A2_12510_DREDEAR_500_1000	Liiilligant!
A2_12510_TIM_500_1000	Oh, it’s Lilligant! It’s got a beautiful flower and a\nreally nice aroma...
A2_12510_RACHEL_500_1000	Tim, let’s report to the quiz professor—the answer’s\ngot to be Lilligant!
A2_12510_TIM_500_3000	Oh, right! Sure, let’s go.
A2_12510_DREDEAR_600_1000	Lilligant!
A2_12510_TIM_600_1000	Oh, that flower’s so pretty! And it smells nice too.
A2_12520_ENEKORORO_400_1000	Del del...
A2_12520_RACHEL_400_1000	It doesn’t seem to be paying any attention to us.
A2_12520_TIM_400_1000	This Pokémon really does march to its own tune,\ndoesn’t it?
A2_12520_ENEKORORO_500_1000	Del del...
A2_12520_TIM_500_1000	This sure is a cute Pokémon.
A2_12520_RACHEL_500_1000	Oh, that’s Delcatty! It really IS cute! Do you suppose\nit’s going for a walk?
A2_12520_ENEKORORO_500_2000	Delll?
A2_12520_TIM_500_2000	It seems pretty used to humans. Do you think this one\nis someone’s partner?
A2_12520_RACHEL_500_2000	This fur around its neck’s like a fluffy scarf—charming,\nisn’t it? I could keep petting it all day!
A2_12520_TIM_500_3000	Oh, wait! Doesn’t that fit the characteristics the quiz\nprofessor described?
A2_12520_RACHEL_500_3000	Oh, you may be right! Let’s go give her our answer!
A2_12520_ENEKORORO_600_1000	Del?
A2_12520_TIM_600_1000	This sure is a cute Pokémon.
A2_12530_MIBRIM_400_1000	... ... ...\nHatenn...
A2_12530_TIM_400_1000	I didn’t expect to find a Hatenna in a place like this.
A2_12530_RACHEL_400_1000	Let’s not bother it.
A2_12530_MIBRIM_500_1000	... ... ...\n...Hatt?
A2_12530_TIM_500_1000	What a quiet Pokémon. Do you know what it is,\nRachel?
A2_12530_RACHEL_500_1000	Yes, this is Hatenna! It almost never shows itself in\nfront of humans.
A2_12530_MIBRIM_500_2000	... ... ...\n...Hatt?
A2_12530_TIM_500_2000	Well, it is pretty quiet back here in this parking lot...\nI suppose not a lot of people come here.
A2_12530_RACHEL_500_2000	This Pokémon only appears in front of people with\ncalm hearts and minds.
A2_12530_RACHEL_500_3000	I’d say that describes you, Tim—it must have popped\nout to see you.
A2_12530_TIM_500_3000	If you say so... Oh, wait, this Hatenna might be the\nPokémon the quiz professor was talking about!
A2_12530_RACHEL_500_4000	Now that you mention it, it could be! Let’s go tell her!
A2_12530_MIBRIM_600_1000	... ... ...\n...Hatt?
A2_12530_TIM_600_1000	Hm? What’s this Pokémon?
A2_1260_LEPARDAS_100_1000	(Why, hello there! I don’t believe we’ve met.)
A2_1260_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, thank goodness—someone I can actually have a\nconversation with.
A2_1260_LEPARDAS_100_2000	(*chuckle* The Pokémon here are a rather quirky\nbunch, aren’t they.)
A2_1260_PIKACHU_100_2000	You said it. Doesn’t help that I’ve got no idea what’s\ngoing on.
A2_1260_LEPARDAS_100_3000	(What do you mean?)
A2_1260_PIKACHU_100_3000	Like how we all suddenly ended up on the roof,\nfor example.
A2_1260_LEPARDAS_100_4000	(Oh, right. I suppose that is a bit strange.)
A2_1260_LEPARDAS_100_5000	(The same thing happens every day, but I really don’t\nknow why.)
A2_1260_PIKACHU_100_4000	Every day, huh? Good to know, thanks.
A2_1260_LEPARDAS_200_1000	(Memories suddenly disappear in this place... Where\ndo you suppose they go?)
A2_12600_PCMANMID01_400_1000	All right, Pignite! When we get to the campsite,\nyou’re in charge of getting a fire going!
A2_12600_PCMANMID01_500_1000	Oh, Detective! Did you find some Berries?!
A2_12600_TIM_500_1000	Yes, these were growing on a tree in Fountain Plaza.
A2_12600_PCMANMID01_500_2000	Oh, yes! These look perfect for Pignite!
A2_12600_CHAOBOO_500_1000	Nite! Pignite!
A2_12600_TIM_500_2000	You’re right. It looks really happy!
A2_12600_RACHEL_500_1000	Now you can go camping, right?
A2_12600_PCMANMID01_500_3000	Yes! Thank you both so much!
A2_12600_CHAOBOO_500_2000	Pig! Pignite!
A2_12600_PCMANMID01_600_1000	If only I’d checked my bag before leaving home...
A2_12600_PCMANMID01_600_2000	Please get me some Berries for Pignite!
A2_12600_CHAOBOO_700_1000	Pig... Pig...
A2_12600_PCMANMID01_700_1000	Oh dear... Just give it a try, Pignite—please!
A2_12600_TIM_700_1000	Is there something I can help you with?
A2_12600_PCMANMID01_700_2000	Actually, there is. We were about to go camping.
A2_12600_PCMANMID01_700_3000	Pignite here is supposed to help light our campfire.
A2_12600_PCMANMID01_700_4000	But Pignite’s already so hungry he won’t even budge.
A2_12600_RACHEL_700_1000	Awww, poor thing...
A2_12600_PCMANMID01_700_5000	I meant to bring along some of his favorite Berries.
A2_12600_PCMANMID01_700_6000	But I guess I totally spaced out and forgot...
A2_12600_PCMANMID01_700_7000	And I can’t just leave Pignite here while I run home to\nget some...
A2_12600_RACHEL_700_2000	Hey Tim, can we go gather up some Berries for\nthese two?
A2_12600_TIM_700_2000	I’d like to, but do you think we can even find Berries\nin the city that Pignite likes?
A2_12600_RACHEL_700_3000	This city is full of Pokémon! And where there are\nPokémon, there are bound to be Berry trees.
A2_12600_RACHEL_700_4000	But the Berries in the most obvious places have\nprobably already been eaten...
A2_12600_TIM_700_3000	Then I guess we’ll just have to check each tree, one\nby one.
A2_12600_TIM_700_4000	OK. If we find any Berries, we’ll bring them back here.
A2_12600_PCMANMID01_700_8000	That’d be a huge help! Thank you so much!
A2_12610_CHAOBOO_200_1000	Pigniiite!
A2_12610_TIM_200_1000	You sure look happy. Looking forward to the camping\ntrip, little guy?
A2_12610_CHAOBOO_300_1000	Pig... Pig...
A2_12610_RACHEL_300_1000	The poor fella’s so hungry, he doesn’t want to move...
A2_12610_TIM_300_1000	We’re gonna go look for some Berries for you, so\nhang in there, OK?
A2_12610_CHAOBOO_400_1000	Pig... Pig...
A2_12610_TIM_400_1000	He looks really down.
A2_12620_TIM_100_1000	Oh! This tree’s got Berries in it!
A2_12620_RACHEL_100_1000	Pignite would probably like these ones!
A2_12620_TIM_100_2000	Then let’s hurry and get them to Pignite’s partner!
A2_12620_TIM_200_1000	I never realized there were actual Berries growing on\nthe trees in this city.
A2_12620_RACHEL_200_1000	Just goes to show what a welcoming place Ryme City\nis for Pokémon.
A2_1270_PKPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	Same old, same old today. Everything’s quiet, and I’m\nbored out of my mind...
A2_1270_PIKACHU_100_1000	This officer seems pretty checked out—and low on\nsituational awareness.
A2_1270_PIKACHU_100_2000	But as tempting as it’d be to make a mad dash for it,\nI oughta investigate the area first.
A2_1280_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hm? Were you arrested and brought here too?
A2_1280_LIVOLT02_100_1000	(What’s the matter with you? Don’t talk to me like\nwe’re friends, you impetuous little Pikachu!)
A2_1280_LIVOLT02_100_2000	(And don’t even THINK about trying to run away!)
A2_1280_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh, you’re that police officer’s partner. Figures...
A2_1280_LIVOLT02_200_1000	(Don’t even think about trying to escape. I’ve got my\neye on you.)
A2_1290_PKPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	Oh, no, you don’t! It’s exercise time. That means you\nexercise HERE—on the roof.
A2_12900_PXMAN01_200_1000	I’ll be sure to keep my ring nice and secure on my\nfinger from now on.
A2_12900_PXMAN01_300_1000	Hi there! This Furret just showed up out of nowhere\nand heroically retrieved my ring for me!
A2_12900_PXMAN01_300_2000	You called it for me, right? Thank you so much!\nIt really saved my neck!
A2_12900_TIM_300_1000	No, don’t thank us—thank Furret!
A2_12900_RACHEL_300_1000	Well done, Furret, really! Thank you from me and\nTim as well!
A2_12900_OOTACHI_300_1000	Fuuurret!
A2_12900_TIM_300_2000	Please be careful not to drop anything that important\nfrom now on, OK?
A2_12900_PXMAN01_300_3000	Hahaha, I’ll do what I can!
A2_12900_PXMAN01_300_4000	I can’t help just staring at my ring. It reminds me of\nhow happy my marriage is!
A2_12900_RACHEL_300_2000	You sound like a really lovely couple!
A2_12900_TIM_300_3000	I have to say, though, I’m pretty surprised that Furret\nwas able to tell what we wanted.
A2_12900_RACHEL_300_3000	I experienced that a lot when I was a kid, actually.
A2_12900_RACHEL_300_4000	Hehe... Maybe it’s a trait passed down from Mama.
A2_12900_TIM_300_4000	Even when we can’t communicate with words, we can\nstill understand each other’s feelings...
A2_12900_PXMAN01_400_1000	How am I gonna get that ring...?
A2_12900_RACHEL_400_1000	It’s almost like he’s in shock...
A2_12900_TIM_400_1000	We’d better hurry and find a Pokémon to help.
A2_12900_PXMAN01_500_1000	Oh no... What do I do?! This’ll be the end of us...
A2_12900_TIM_500_1000	What’s wrong? It looks like something pretty serious...
A2_12900_PXMAN01_500_2000	Please, you’ve gotta help me!
A2_12900_TIM_500_2000	J-just calm down! What exactly happened?
A2_12900_PXMAN01_500_3000	Well, you see, I accidentally dropped my\nwedding ring...
A2_12900_RACHEL_500_1000	Oh no! That really is serious!
A2_12900_PXMAN01_500_4000	I think it rolled into the gap between these buildings,\nbut it’s so narrow I can’t reach down there.
A2_12900_PXMAN01_500_5000	I can’t show my face at home if I don’t get it back!
A2_12900_TIM_500_3000	We can’t fit in a gap that narrow, either...
A2_12900_RACHEL_500_2000	But maybe a small Pokémon could!
A2_12900_TIM_500_4000	Good thinking—a long, slender Pokémon may be just\nwhat we need.
A2_12900_TIM_500_5000	Let’s look around and see if we can find one that’s\nwilling to help.
A2_12900_PXMAN01_500_6000	Please do! I’m done for if I don’t find that ring!
A2_12910_OOTACHI_400_1000	Furret!
A2_12910_RACHEL_400_1000	Oh, look, a Furret!
A2_12910_TIM_400_1000	Do you think this Pokémon would fit inside that gap?
A2_12910_RACHEL_400_2000	Oh—to get that guy’s wedding ring? Yeah, Furret\nwould be perfect for the job!
A2_12910_TIM_400_2000	Let’s ask it.
A2_12910_TIM_400_3000	Hey, Furret, someone lost something important to him.
A2_12910_TIM_400_4000	We could really use your help getting him out of\nthis pinch.
A2_12910_OOTACHI_400_2000	Furret?
A2_12910_TIM_400_5000	Hmm. I don’t think it understands.
A2_12910_RACHEL_400_3000	Please, he’s in a lot of trouble! We seriously need\nyour help!
A2_12910_OOTACHI_400_3000	...Furret!
A2_12910_RACHEL_400_4000	Did it understand?
A2_12910_TIM_400_6000	Even if it didn’t understand your words, your feelings\ncame out loud and clear.
A2_12910_RACHEL_400_5000	I hope so.
A2_12910_TIM_400_7000	The person who needs help is over in Fountain Plaza.\nCan you go help him, Furret?
A2_12910_OOTACHI_400_4000	Furr! Furret!
A2_12910_TIM_400_8000	I think it really did go off to help him. That’d be\nsuch a relief.
A2_12910_RACHEL_400_6000	Come on, let’s go see!
A2_12910_OOTACHI_500_1000	Furret! Furr!
A2_12910_TIM_500_1000	Looks like a pretty nimble Pokémon.
A2_12920_OOTACHI_100_1000	Furr! Furret?
A2_12920_TIM_100_1000	Thanks for your help earlier, Furret!
A2_1300_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(I thought I told you to keep quiet, newbie!)
A2_1300_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, I thought you didn’t wanna talk to me! And now\nhere you are, strikin’ up a conversation?
A2_1300_YAMIRAMI_100_2000	(You won’t be running your mouth like that for long.)
A2_1300_YAMIRAMI_100_3000	(Follow me. Luxray wants to see you.)
A2_1300_PIKACHU_100_2000	Luxray?
A2_1300_YAMIRAMI_100_4000	(Heh heh. He’ll teach you how things work around\nhere—he’ll teach you real good!)
A2_13010_EIPAM_200_1000	Aipo!
A2_13010_TIM_200_1000	Hey there, Aipom. You’d better not be planning any\npranks to play in the city, OK?
A2_14010_PHGIRL01_100_1000	You’re looking cute today too, Maractus!
A2_14010_PHGIRL01_100_2000	Shake your arms with a whole lotta energy...\nYes! That’s adorable!
A2_14010_MARACACCHI_100_1000	Actus!
A2_14020_PHGIRL01_100_1000	OK, Maractus! Just do what you always do!
A2_14020_PHGIRL01_100_2000	And Snubbull, you watch Maractus’s moves and see if\nyou can copy them.
A2_14020_MARACACCHI_100_1000	Actus!
A2_14020_BULU_100_1000	S...snuuub!
A2_1410_TIM_100_1000	Well, I made it to the police station, but I wonder if\nthey’ll even let me see Pikachu.
A2_1410_TIM_100_2000	He must be so lonely all by himself in there...
A2_1410_TIM_100_3000	I still can’t believe they’d just drag him off like that,\nout of the blue.
A2_1410_TIM_100_4000	Brad said something about property damage, but that\ndoesn’t sound like Pikachu at all.
A2_1420_TIM_100_1000	I’ve gotta go ask if they’ll let me see Pikachu!
A2_1430_LIVOLT02_100_1000	Manec! Manec!
A2_1430_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_1000	That area is off-limits to the public!
A2_1430_TIM_100_1000	S-sorry...
A2_1440_LIVOLT02_100_1000	Manec.
A2_1440_TIM_100_1000	I wonder if this is Brad’s Manectric...
A2_1440_LIVOLT02_100_2000	Manec?
A2_1440_TIM_100_2000	Without Pikachu here, I have no idea what\nyou’re saying.
A2_1450_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_1000	This is the reception area. State your business.
A2_1450_TIM_100_1000	My partner Pikachu is being detained by the police.
A2_1450_TIM_100_2000	Is this where they’re keeping him?
A2_1450_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_2000	Detained Pokémon are held in custody at this\nstation, yes.
A2_1450_TIM_100_4000	How is Pikachu doing? Would it be possible for me to\nsee him?
A2_1450_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_3000	I’m afraid that won’t be possible without express\npermission from headquarters.
A2_1450_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_4000	Furthermore, I’m unable to share any information\nrelated to an ongoing investigation.
A2_1450_TIM_100_5000	You can’t be serious...
A2_1470_BUTLER_100_1000	We’ll be holding Pikachu in custody here for a while.
A2_1470_BUTLER_100_2000	He’s suspected of causing property damage last night\nin Fountain Plaza.
A2_1470_TIM_100_1000	Pikachu would never do that!
A2_1470_BUTLER_100_3000	I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but we’ve\ngot proof.
A2_1470_BUTLER_100_4000	That being said, we’re still investigating the matter.\nI can’t allow any visits before the dust settles.
A2_1470_TIM_100_2000	So there’s really no way I can see him?
A2_1470_BUTLER_100_5000	Look, I’m sure this is tough for you, but we don’t do\nspecial treatment here—not even for you, young\ndetective.
A2_1470_BUTLER_100_6000	Anyway, kiddo, I’ll see you around.
A2_1470_HOLIDAY_100_1000	... ... ...
A2_1470_TIM_100_3000	Am I right in assuming you can’t tell me anything\neither, Inspector?
A2_1470_HOLIDAY_100_2000	I’m afraid it’s just as Chief Butler says.
A2_1470_HOLIDAY_100_3000	But I’ll do what I can to arrange a visit for you. Come\nback to the reception area sometime this afternoon.
A2_1470_TIM_100_4000	Really?! Thank you so much!
A2_1470_HOLIDAY_100_4000	Don’t mention it, Tim. Oh, and one more thing—I’d\nlike to have a chat with you tonight.
A2_1470_HOLIDAY_100_5000	I’d rather not go into the details here, so let’s meet\nnear the station after sundown.
A2_1470_TIM_100_5000	All right. I’ll see you this evening.
A2_1470_HOLIDAY_100_6000	I know this must be rough, but...hang in there, Tim.
A2_1470_TIM_100_6000	Thanks to Inspector Holiday, I’ll be able to meet with\nPikachu this afternoon.
A2_1470_TIM_100_7000	Until then, I’ll just do what I can.
A2_1470_TIM_100_8000	First...I think I’ll go check out the scene of the crime.
A2_1470_TIM_100_9000	I just don’t believe Pikachu would destroy anything.
A2_1470_TIM_100_10000	The police must’ve gotten the wrong idea somehow.
A2_1480_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_1000	We’re not allowing visitations right now.
A2_1490_TIM_100_1000	Fountain Plaza is down the street from the police\nstation, next to the Hi-Hat Café.
A2_1490_TIM_100_2000	I should head there right away.
A2_1500_PAPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	You’re Tim, right? The detective?
A2_1500_TIM_100_1000	Yes...?
A2_1500_PAPOLICEMAN01_100_2000	You know, I never thought the famous Detective\nPikachu would commit such a serious crime.
A2_1500_TIM_100_2000	Pikachu is innocent, and I’m going to prove it.
A2_1500_PAPOLICEMAN01_200_1000	I can’t believe something like that would happen in\nFountain Plaza.
A2_1510_TIM_300_1000	This isn’t the way to Fountain Plaza.
A2_1510_TIM_400_1000	This isn’t the way to the Hi-Hat Café.
A2_1510_TIM_500_1000	This isn’t the way to the police station.
A2_1510_TIM_600_1000	This isn’t the way to Fountain Plaza.
A2_1510_TIM_700_1000	Oops. No reason for us to go this way.
A2_1520_TIM_300_1000	This isn’t the way to Fountain Plaza.
A2_1520_TIM_400_1000	This isn’t the way to the Hi-Hat Café.
A2_1520_TIM_500_1000	This isn’t the way to the police station.
A2_1520_TIM_600_1000	This isn’t the way to Fountain Plaza.
A2_1530_TIM_100_1000	This is no time for a coffee break. I need to go\ninvestigate Fountain Plaza.
A2_1540_TIM_300_1000	This way leads out of Fountain Plaza.
A2_1540_TIM_400_1000	This isn’t the way to the Hi-Hat Café.
A2_1540_TIM_500_1000	This isn’t the way to the police station.
A2_1540_TIM_600_1000	This way leads out of Fountain Plaza.
A2_1540_TIM_700_1000	Oops. No reason for us to go this way.
A2_1550_TIM_300_1000	This way leads out of Fountain Plaza.
A2_1550_TIM_400_1000	This isn’t the way to the Hi-Hat Café.
A2_1550_TIM_500_1000	This isn’t the way to the police station.
A2_1550_TIM_600_1000	This way leads out of Fountain Plaza.
A2_1560_TIM_300_1000	This way leads out of Fountain Plaza.
A2_1560_TIM_400_1000	This isn’t the way to the Hi-Hat Café.
A2_1560_TIM_500_1000	This isn’t the way to the police station.
A2_1560_TIM_600_1000	This way leads out of Fountain Plaza.
A2_1560_TIM_700_1000	Oops. No reason for us to go this way.
A2_1570_PHWOMAN01_100_1000	Hello! Would you like to buy some flowers?
A2_1570_TIM_100_1000	Not right now, sorry...
A2_1590_INTEREON_100_1000	Inteli!
A2_1590_TIM_100_1000	Huh. This Inteleon seems to like flowers.
A2_1600_PKMAN01_100_1000	I never thought anything like that would happen in\nFountain Plaza...
A2_1600_PKMAN01_100_2000	Do you know if they’ve caught the culprit?
A2_1600_TIM_100_1000	... ... ...
A2_1600_PKMAN01_200_1000	Maybe it’s best to stay away from Fountain Plaza for\na while...
A2_1620_MORPEKOMANPUKU_100_1000	Peko!
A2_1620_TIM_100_1000	You look like a hearty little eater, Morpeko.
A2_1630_TIM_100_1000	Hm? Someone’s there...
A2_1650_TIM_100_1000	Was Brad examining that Slowpoke statue?
A2_1650_TIM_100_2000	There aren’t any other police officers around, though.\nWhy only Brad?
A2_1650_TIM_100_3000	I’d better take a look myself.
A2_1660_TIM_100_1000	So this is the scene of the crime.
A2_1660_TIM_100_2000	Maybe I can learn something by examining any traces\nthe culprit left behind.
A2_1680_TIM_100_1000	Now, where should I look first...
A2_1690_TIM_5000_1000	I think there’s still more to see here...
A2_1700_TIM_100_1000	There are fragments of the Slowpoke statue on the\nground. The statue must’ve been broken by a\nPokémon move.
A2_1700_TIM_100_2000	Maybe I should pick one up for a better look—owww!
A2_1700_TIM_100_3000	My hand’s gone numb! <color=#F39800FF>These fragments must be\ncharged with electricity.</color>
A2_1710_TIM_100_1000	The grass has been scorched. <color=#F39800FF>It must’ve been caused\nby a Pokémon that generates a lot of heat.</color>
A2_1720_TIM_100_1000	Huh? What’s with this water? <color=#F39800FF>I guess it must have\nspilled out of the fountain.</color>
A2_1730_TIM_100_1000	The Slowpoke statue has been broken. This must be\nwhat Brad meant by “property damage.”
A2_1730_TIM_100_2000	<color=#F39800FF>The statue’s got scorch marks on it...</color>
A2_1750_TIM_100_1000	I think I’ve seen about everything there is to see.
A2_1765_TIM_100_1000	I’ve already had a good look around here. Don’t think\nthere’s much left to see.
A2_1765_TIM_100_2000	I still wonder who could have done such a thing...
A2_1770_TIM_100_1000	After we got back from the ruins yesterday, Pikachu\nwent out on his own.
A2_1770_TIM_100_2000	And knowing him...
A2_1770_TIM_100_3000	Pikachu might have gone to the Hi-Hat Café.\nI’d better go and check with Pablo.
A2_1780_PABLO_100_1000	Hey, welcome! I see Pikachu’s not with you today.
A2_1780_TIM_100_1000	We were actually on our way here this morning,\nbut the police stopped us out front and arrested\nPikachu...
A2_1780_PABLO_100_2000	Wait, Pikachu was arrested?! We’re talking about\nYOUR Pikachu, right?!
A2_1780_PABLO_100_3000	You know, now that you mention it, I did hear a\ncommotion outside earlier. That must have been it.
A2_1780_PABLO_100_4000	Did Pikachu do something bad?
A2_1780_TIM_100_2000	The police are saying that Pikachu’s the one who\ndamaged the Slowpoke statue in Fountain Plaza...
A2_1780_TIM_100_3000	But there’s no way Pikachu could have done it!\nI mean, he can’t even use any moves...
A2_1780_PABLO_100_5000	Yeah, no way you can deal that sort of damage\nwithout using moves.
A2_1780_PABLO_100_6000	And besides, the statue got busted up last\nnight, right?
A2_1780_PABLO_100_7000	Pikachu was here at the café last night.
A2_1780_TIM_100_4000	Really?! Please, tell me more!
A2_1780_PABLO_200_1000	I hope Pikachu can come back soon.
A2_1780_SEL_0_1000	About Pikachu...
A2_1780_SEL_0_2000	About the Slowpoke statue...
A2_1780_TIM_300_1000	Please, tell me more about when Pikachu came\nhere last night!
A2_1780_PABLO_300_1000	Oh, it was the same as always.
A2_1780_PABLO_300_2000	I gave him his usual—a cup of freshly brewed black\ncoffee. He sure seemed to enjoy it!
A2_1780_TIM_300_2000	About what time last night was that?
A2_1780_PABLO_300_3000	I’m sorry, I don’t remember.
A2_1780_TIM_300_3000	I guess we can’t establish an alibi, then...
A2_1780_PABLO_300_4000	Oh, but <color=#F39800FF>he was still here when the evening news was\nplaying on TV</color>.
A2_1780_PABLO_300_5000	If only I could remember the time the show came on...\nSorry I can’t be more help.
A2_1780_TIM_300_4000	Oh, please don’t apologize, Pablo! You’ve been a\nhuge help!
A2_1780_TIM_400_1000	So you already knew about what happened to the\nSlowpoke statue?
A2_1780_PABLO_400_1000	Yeah, I couldn’t believe my ears when I heard about it\nthis morning. Such a shame...
A2_1780_PABLO_400_2000	It must’ve been a really strong Pokémon if it\ncould damage that Slowpoke statue. That thing\nlooked solid!
A2_1780_PABLO_400_3000	I really doubt your Pikachu could deal that kinda\ndamage.
A2_1780_TIM_400_2000	You can say that again, much as he’d hate to hear it...
A2_1780_PABLO_400_4000	Ahaha! Pardon me, then!
A2_1780_PABLO_400_5000	Jokes aside, I doubt that incident went unnoticed—\nsome of the customers here may be able to tell you\nsomething about it.
A2_1780_PABLO_400_6000	Go ahead, ask around.
A2_1780_TIM_400_3000	Good idea. Thanks, Pablo.
A2_1790_PCMAN01_100_1000	The food and drinks here are all fantastic. This place\nreally is the best!
A2_1790_TIM_100_1000	Excuse me. Do you mind if I ask a few questions?
A2_1790_PCMAN01_100_2000	Hmm? What did you want to know?
A2_1790_PCMAN01_200_1000	Ask me anything you want.
A2_1790_SEL_0_1000	About Pikachu...
A2_1790_SEL_0_2000	About the Slowpoke statue...
A2_1790_TIM_300_1000	Did you see a Pikachu last night?
A2_1790_PCMAN01_300_1000	A Pikachu? No, I didn’t see one last night...but I DID\nsee one just a few minutes ago.
A2_1790_PCMAN01_300_2000	I went to the police station to pick up something I’d\nlost, and I saw a Pikachu there.
A2_1790_TIM_300_2000	Really?! How did it look?
A2_1790_PCMAN01_300_3000	<color=#F39800FF>He seemed to be sleeping. An officer was carrying\nhim into the station.</color>
A2_1790_TIM_300_3000	Sleeping...? How could he just doze off with all that’s\nbeen going on?
A2_1790_PCMAN01_300_4000	Is something wrong?
A2_1790_TIM_300_4000	Oh, no...it’s nothing!
A2_1790_TIM_400_1000	Have you heard about what happened to the\nSlowpoke statue?
A2_1790_PCMAN01_400_1000	Oh yeah, I hear it was kinda wild. I haven’t been to\nsee the plaza myself, though.
A2_1800_TIM_100_1000	Excuse me. May I ask you a few questions?
A2_1800_PKBUSINESSMAN01_100_1000	Depends, who’s asking? I’m trying to eat here,\nyou know...
A2_1800_TIM_100_2000	I don’t mean to inconvenience you. I’m actually\ninvestigating the incident at Fountain Plaza...
A2_1800_PKBUSINESSMAN01_100_2000	Ah...you must be that detective kid. In that case,\nI’d be happy to help.
A2_1800_PKBUSINESSMAN01_200_1000	What do you want to know?
A2_1800_SEL_0_1000	About Pikachu...
A2_1800_SEL_0_2000	About the Slowpoke statue...
A2_1800_TIM_300_1000	Did you happen to see a Pikachu yesterday?
A2_1800_PKBUSINESSMAN01_300_1000	I did indeed, last night at Fountain Plaza.
A2_1800_TIM_300_2000	At Fountain Plaza?! Please, tell me more about that!
A2_1800_PKBUSINESSMAN01_300_2000	By the time I saw the Pikachu, the Slowpoke statue\nhad already been damaged.
A2_1800_PKBUSINESSMAN01_300_3000	<color=#F39800FF>I only saw Pikachu from behind as it was leaving, but\nthere was no mistaking that yellow back.</color>
A2_1800_PKBUSINESSMAN01_300_4000	The Pikachu just wandered off somewhere afterward.
A2_1800_TIM_300_3000	I see...
A2_1800_TIM_400_1000	Have you heard about what happened to the\nSlowpoke statue?
A2_1800_PKBUSINESSMAN01_400_1000	Heard about it? I saw it with my own eyes! Shattered!
A2_1800_PKBUSINESSMAN01_400_2000	Such an awful thing to do, breaking a statue like that.
A2_1800_PKBUSINESSMAN01_400_3000	You’re investigating the incident, right? I hope you\ncatch whoever did it.
A2_1800_TIM_400_2000	Yeah... I’m doing everything I can.
A2_1810_RUNPAPPA_100_1000	Ludi!
A2_1810_TIM_100_1000	Being greeted by Ludicolo just isn’t the same\nwithout Pikachu here...
A2_1810_RUNPAPPA_200_1000	Ludi!
A2_1820_TIM_100_1000	I’d better interview the people here before I leave.
A2_1830_TIM_100_1000	Oh, it’s afternoon already. Maybe I can visit\nPikachu now.
A2_1830_TIM_100_2000	Time to head over to the police station.
A2_1840_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_1000	Oh, Tim. Your request has been approved by\nInspector Holiday.
A2_1840_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_2000	You are now allowed to visit Pikachu.
A2_1840_TIM_100_1000	Thank goodness!
A2_1840_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_3000	But before that, Tim...
A2_1840_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_4000	Let me explain our Pokémon partner visitation rules.
A2_1840_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_5000	Visits are allowed in the afternoons.
A2_1840_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_6000	You can visit your partner a maximum of twice per\nday, but they cannot be consecutive visits.
A2_1840_TIM_100_2000	OK... I’ll keep that in mind.
A2_1840_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_7000	Are you ready to visit your partner?
A2_1840_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_200_1000	Are you ready to visit your partner?
A2_1840_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_1840_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_1840_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_300_1000	Then follow me.
A2_1840_TIM_400_1000	Sorry, there’s something I need to do first. I’ll be\nright back.
A2_19001_TIM_100_1000	These are the medals we received.
A2_19001_PIKACHU_100_1000	They’re proof of all the good we’ve done with our\ngreat detective work. Let’s keep it up, Tim!
A2_19002_TIM_100_1000	We brought back a ton of Berries from the ruins.
A2_19002_PIKACHU_100_1000	We sure did! I had a blast tasting so many different\nflavors. Let’s whip up something with these later!
A2_1910_TIM_100_1000	Well, I finally get to see Pikachu. I wonder how he’s\nholding up...
A2_1910_PAPOLICEMAN02_100_1000	Apologies for the wait. Here’s Pikachu to see you.
A2_1910_PIKACHU_100_1000	Huh, so this is the visitation room.
A2_1930_TIM_100_1000	Are you all right, Pikachu? This all happened so\nsuddenly—I’ve been really worried!
A2_1930_PIKACHU_100_1000	I don’t blame ya! Just think—a great detective like me\nbeing accused of a crime!
A2_1930_TIM_100_2000	The Pokémon Protection Bureau thinks you broke the\nSlowpoke statue in Fountain Plaza.
A2_1930_TIM_100_3000	I took a look around the scene myself. The statue\nfragments I found were electrified.
A2_1930_PIKACHU_100_2000	That means the culprit is a Pokémon that can use\nElectric-type moves.
A2_1930_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hey... Wait a minute! I can’t use ANY moves!
A2_1930_TIM_100_4000	Don’t worry, I know. You couldn’t be the culprit.
A2_1930_TIM_100_5000	But I can’t tell the PPB anything you’ve said. They’d\nnever believe me.
A2_1930_PIKACHU_100_4000	Yeah... If you tell them, “Pikachu says he’s innocent,”\nthey’re just gonna look at you funny.
A2_1930_TIM_100_6000	I want you to tell me everything you know, Pikachu.\nI’m going to prove your innocence!
A2_1930_PIKACHU_100_5000	I knew I could depend on you. Sure, ask away.
A2_1930_PIKACHU_200_1000	Anything else you want to ask?
A2_1930_SEL_0_1000	About what you were doing last night...
A2_1930_SEL_0_2000	What you’ve been up to since the arrest...
A2_1930_SEL_0_3000	The situation in the station...
A2_1930_TIM_300_1000	Can you tell me what you were doing last night?
A2_1930_PIKACHU_300_1000	After we split up, I headed to the Hi-Hat Café.
A2_1930_PIKACHU_300_2000	I wanted to sit and think over what happened last\nnight, and how all the cases we’ve handled so far\nmight be connected...
A2_1930_PIKACHU_300_3000	For that, I needed coffee!
A2_1930_PIKACHU_300_4000	<color=#F39800FF>I </color><color=#F39800FF>stopped by the plaza on my way to the café, but at\nthat point, the Slowpoke statue was unharmed.</color>
A2_1930_TIM_300_2000	Were there any other Pokémon around at the time?\nMaybe ones that could use Electric-type moves?
A2_1930_PIKACHU_300_5000	No, I didn’t see any. The culprit must have arrived\nafter I left.
A2_1930_TIM_300_3000	I see... Well, how about after you got to the café?\nAnything strange happen?
A2_1930_PIKACHU_300_6000	Now that you mention it, while I was relaxing in the\ncafé, I remember hearing a loud clap of thunder or\nsomething outside.
A2_1930_TIM_300_4000	Thunder, huh? That might have been the sound of the\nElectric-type move that damaged the statue.
A2_1930_TIM_300_5000	About what time did you hear the sound?
A2_1930_PIKACHU_300_7000	<color=#F39800FF>I don’t remember the exact time, but I know that the\nevening news was on when I heard the noise.</color>
A2_1930_TIM_300_6000	Thanks, Pikachu. I’m sure this information will come\nin handy.
A2_1930_TIM_400_1000	What happened after Brad took you away?
A2_1930_PIKACHU_400_1000	<color=#F39800FF>I fell asleep in the car. By the time I woke up, I was in\nthe detainment room.</color>
A2_1930_TIM_400_2000	Wait...you fell asleep in the car? Was it especially\ncomfortable or something?
A2_1930_PIKACHU_400_2000	No more than any other car, I suppose. Not sure\nwhy I zonked out...
A2_1930_PIKACHU_400_3000	That’s not the only strange thing that’s happened,\nthough.
A2_1930_PIKACHU_400_4000	There’ve been times in the station where I’ve just...\nlost my memory.
A2_1930_TIM_400_3000	Wait, what?
A2_1930_PIKACHU_400_5000	One moment I’ll be in the detainment room, the next\nI’ll be up on the roof with no idea how I got there.
A2_1930_PIKACHU_400_6000	I heard an announcement that it was time to exercise,\nbut I don’t remember walking there myself.
A2_1930_TIM_400_4000	It almost sounds like something’s using Hypnosis\non you.
A2_1930_PIKACHU_400_7000	I haven’t seen any Pokémon here that can use a move\nlike that, though.
A2_1930_PIKACHU_500_1000	I got a bad feelin’ about this station. The whole place\nseems off.
A2_1930_PIKACHU_500_2000	All the other Pokémon here keep giving me a\nhard time.
A2_1930_PIKACHU_500_3000	I think I drew too much attention. One even knocked\nme out with a move earlier.
A2_1930_TIM_500_1000	What?! Are you OK? You’re not injured, are you?
A2_1930_PIKACHU_500_4000	No, nothing serious, but BOY does it still sting! It was\na pretty strong attack.
A2_1930_TIM_500_2000	Well, I’m glad you’re all right, but try to stay out of\ntrouble, OK?
A2_1930_PIKACHU_500_5000	Yeah, don’t worry about me. I’ll be more careful\nnext time!
A2_1930_TIM_500_3000	I hope you and the others can learn to get along.\nAbout how many other Pokémon are being held\nwith you?
A2_1930_PIKACHU_500_6000	I’ve met five others. All of them have a weird gizmo\nstuck on their backs, too, come to think of it...
A2_1930_PIKACHU_500_7000	It’s probably a tag or somethin’ the PPB are using to\nkeep track of us.
A2_1930_TIM_500_4000	If that’s true, they may also be able to use it to track\nyou. No grand escape plans, OK?
A2_1930_PIKACHU_500_8000	Me? Escape? I’d never! I’m gonna get outta here the\nright way—by proving my innocence!
A2_1940_TIM_100_1000	Based on what you’ve told me, I think I can pin down\nwhere you were when the crime took place.
A2_1940_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, really?
A2_1940_TIM_100_2000	Yeah. Just let me look back over my case notebook.
A2_1950_PHPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	You still have time for this visit. But you’ll need to\nleave as soon as your time is up.
A2_1960_TIM_100_1000	Hang in there, Pikachu. I’m gonna find the Pokémon\nthat did this.
A2_1960_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thanks, Tim. I’m countin’ on ya. Just be careful while\nyou investigate.
A2_1960_PIKACHU_100_2000	Don’t forget you’re tracking down a Pokémon that\ncan use powerful Electric-type moves.
A2_1960_TIM_100_2000	Don’t worry, Pikachu—I’ll try not to get knocked out\nlike you did.
A2_1960_PIKACHU_100_3000	You had to bring that up, didn’t you? Ah well, as long\nas you understand.
A2_1960_TIM_100_5000	Chief Butler said he has proof that you committed\nthe crime, Pikachu.
A2_1960_TIM_100_6000	So maybe there’s another Pikachu here in Ryme City.
A2_1960_PIKACHU_100_5000	Another Pikachu besides me?
A2_1960_PIKACHU_100_6000	I think it’s a little early to make that conclusion.\nBut I’ll admit it’s possible.
A2_1960_PIKACHU_100_7000	I’ll keep investigating what I can here in the station.\nThere are a few other things naggin’ at me too.
A2_1960_TIM_100_7000	OK... I’ll keep questioning people in the city.
A2_2010_TIM_100_1000	Pikachu was acting really strange just now...
A2_2010_TIM_100_2000	Maybe that’s what he meant when he was talking\nabout losing his memory.
A2_2010_TIM_100_3000	I’m curious about that cube-shaped device on his\nback, too.
A2_2010_TIM_100_4000	It’s just about time to meet Inspector Holiday. I’ll run\nall my questions by him.
A2_20110_BEROBA_100_1000	(Wow! Luxray let you ride on his back?!)
A2_20110_PIKACHU_100_1000	Pretty cool, huh, Impidimp? After this is all over, I’ll\nlet you hitch a ride on him.
A2_20110_RENTORAR_100_1000	(...Don’t promise that without consulting me first.)
A2_20110_PIKACHU_100_2000	C’mon, why not? It’s no skin off your back, right?
A2_20120_BEROBA_100_1000	(Must be nice riding on Luxray’s back like that...)
A2_20130_LEPARDAS_100_1000	(How precious! It almost looks like Luxray is\nbabysitting you.)
A2_20130_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Don’t mock us.)
A2_20130_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah! You clearly don’t understand how cool we look!
A2_20130_LEPARDAS_100_2000	(Mmhmhm... Yes, of course. I feel very safe in your\nhands—both of you.)
A2_20140_LEPARDAS_100_1000	(You’re planning to investigate this building, right?\nDo be careful.)
A2_20150_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(Luxray?! I’ve...never seen you like this before!)
A2_20150_RENTORAR_100_1000	(We need Pikachu’s help to get out of here.)
A2_20150_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, we’ve teamed up. I’m really counting on\nLuxray here.
A2_20150_YAMIRAMI_100_2000	(*sigh* If only Luxray would team up with me...)
A2_20160_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(Pikachu... I’m so jealous of you right now!)
A2_20170_GORONDA_100_1000	(You must have unlocked the door to get in here.\nI didn’t know you could do that.)
A2_20170_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m pretty good at this sort of thing. Luxray came up\nwith a plan, and I pulled it off!
A2_20170_GORONDA_100_2000	(I see... I wouldn’t be able to do that.)
A2_20170_PIKACHU_100_2000	But even though the door’s unlocked, don’t try to\nescape just yet.
A2_20170_PIKACHU_100_3000	We need to investigate a little more before we can be\nsure we’ll actually get out.
A2_20170_GORONDA_100_3000	(OK. I trust you two, so I’ll wait here.)
A2_20170_RENTORAR_100_1000	(We won’t fail you.)
A2_20180_GORONDA_100_1000	(I’d help you investigate, but I’m too easy to notice.\nI’ll wait here.)
A2_20190_DEDENNE_100_1000	(Oh, wow! A Luxray!)
A2_20190_DEDENNE_100_2000	(Hey...were you brought here because of the\nSlowpoke statue too, Luxray?)
A2_20190_PIKACHU_100_1000	No, it seems like Luxray’s here for something else.
A2_2020_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_1000	Allow me to explain our visitation rules.
A2_2020_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_2000	Visits are allowed in the afternoons.
A2_2020_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_3000	You can visit your partner a maximum of twice per\nday, but they cannot be consecutive visits.
A2_2020_TIM_100_1000	Meaning?
A2_2020_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_4000	Meaning no back-to-back visits.
A2_20200_YOKUBARISU_100_1000	(Oh, the door opened! Does this mean we can\nleave now?)
A2_20200_PIKACHU_100_1000	Just sit tight a little bit longer, please. We’re gonna\ngo check out the rest of the building first.
A2_20200_PIKACHU_100_2000	By the way, we couldn’t have gotten the doors open\nwithout your help. Thanks, Greedent.
A2_20210_MIRUHOG_100_1000	(Wh-whoa, Pikachu! Are you outta your mind?!\nThat’s Luxray you’re riding!)
A2_20210_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Luxray can hear you, you know.
A2_20210_RENTORAR_100_1000	(...It’s fine.)
A2_20220_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_100_1000	(Grrr... I can’t take this much longer! When’s the\nfood coming?!)
A2_20220_PIKACHU_100_1000	I already told you—a police officer should be coming\nby later to bring you some food.
A2_20220_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_100_2000	(Grrr... I hate this...but I’ll wait! Just this once!!!)
A2_20230_INTEREON_100_1000	(Oh my, what do we have here? The door appears to\nbe unlocked now!)
A2_20230_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, but don’t jump the gun, Inteleon. We can’t\nmake a break for it yet, so just wait for now.
A2_20250_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Be careful, Pikachu. There seems to be a human\ninside that room.)
A2_20250_PIKACHU_100_1000	There weren’t any people there when I was in that\nroom earlier... They must’ve just come back!
A2_20250_RENTORAR_100_2000	(We need to be very careful going forward, then.\nThe last thing we want is for them to notice us.)
A2_20260_PIKACHU_100_1000	Gah! We’ve been spotted!
A2_20280_PIKACHU_100_1000	Darn it! Let’s try again!
A2_20295_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Now, which room did you want to go to?)
A2_20295_PIKACHU_100_1000	Just a second—I’m checking the floor plan.
A2_20295_PIKACHU_100_2000	First up is the reference room, which we’re close to\nnow. After that, let’s head to the meeting room right\nnext to it.
A2_20295_PIKACHU_100_3000	It looks like there’s a really big room in the back too...
A2_20295_RENTORAR_100_2000	(There are a lot of humans in that room.)
A2_20295_PIKACHU_100_4000	In that case, we should probably leave that one\nfor later.
A2_20295_RENTORAR_100_3000	(Then let’s begin with the nearby room and the one\nnext to it.)
A2_20295_PIKACHU_100_5000	Yeah. It’s all up to you, Luxray.
A2_2030_LIVOLT02_100_1000	Manec.
A2_2030_TIM_100_1000	This Manectric must be a police officer’s partner.
A2_20300_RENTORAR_100_1000	(There are humans there. Let’s turn back.)
A2_20343_PIKACHU_100_1000	Darn it! Let’s try again!
A2_20347_RENTORAR_100_1000	(There’s no need for us to go back down there.)
A2_20350_RENTORAR_100_1000	(There’s a human standing guard on the floor above.\nWe shouldn’t go there right now.)
A2_20360_PIKACHU_100_1000	Look... It’s a photo from when the Slowpoke statue\nwas damaged!
A2_20360_RENTORAR_100_1000	(And that’s clearly you in it.)
A2_20360_PIKACHU_100_2000	Except it isn’t me. So what’s going on with this photo?
A2_20360_PIKACHU_100_3000	I’m gonna hold on to this—I wanna look into it\nwith Tim.
A2_20370_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey... I think this is a manual for those cube-shaped\ndevices they stuck on us.
A2_20370_RENTORAR_100_1000	(What devices?)
A2_20370_PIKACHU_100_2000	Haven’t you seen ’em stuck to everyone’s necks or\nbacks? There’s one on you too, Luxray.
A2_20370_PIKACHU_100_3000	Let’s see... The manual explains how to attach one to\na Pokémon.
A2_20370_RENTORAR_100_2000	(Is that all?)
A2_20370_PIKACHU_100_4000	Yeah, that’s it. Doesn’t explain what these things\nactually ARE at all.
A2_20370_PIKACHU_100_5000	Well, they’ve got tons of manuals here—I don’t think\nanyone’ll notice if I take just one.
A2_20370_PIKACHU_200_1000	These are instruction manuals for putting the\ncube-shaped devices on Pokémon.
A2_20375_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Not this way—the humans will see us.)
A2_20375_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’d be...not so good for us. Back we go.
A2_20380_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, I think that’s all we need to see in this room.
A2_20380_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Then let’s move on to another one.)
A2_2040_HOLIDAY_100_1000	There you are, Tim. Just as we agreed.
A2_2040_TIM_100_1000	Inspector Holiday!
A2_2040_HOLIDAY_100_2000	Sorry to drag you out like this—I know it must be a\nrough time for you.
A2_2040_HOLIDAY_100_3000	Now, I’d love to start our chat right away, but this\nmight not be the best place.
A2_2040_HOLIDAY_100_4000	Let’s talk over there.
A2_20400_PIKACHU_100_1000	What the heck is this? A poster celebrating Butler’s\npromotion to chief?!
A2_20400_PIKACHU_100_2000	So it’s been a year since Butler got put in charge.
A2_20400_PIKACHU_100_3000	Can’t say he’s got much taste, pattin’ himself on the\nback with stuff like this.
A2_20400_PIKACHU_200_1000	It’s a poster celebrating Butler’s promotion to chief\nof the PPB last year.
A2_20400_PIKACHU_200_2000	I guess it’s supposed to raise morale for the newly\nfounded PPB, but I’d say it’s in pretty poor taste...
A2_20410_PIKACHU_100_1000	Here’s a list of all the incidents that were supposedly\ncaused by the Pokémon being detained here.
A2_20410_PIKACHU_100_2000	Stuff like stealing people’s food, destroying a flower\ndisplay at the florist’s...
A2_20410_PIKACHU_100_3000	And my name’s on here too—property damage at\nFountain Plaza...
A2_20410_PIKACHU_100_4000	This whole list is nothing but a load of malarkey!
A2_20410_PIKACHU_100_5000	I know I didn’t do this, and the others all said they\ndidn’t do these things, either.
A2_20410_PIKACHU_100_6000	Oh... Here’s your name, Luxray.
A2_20410_PIKACHU_100_7000	It says you and Mightyena were running amok just off\n2nd Avenue.
A2_20410_RENTORAR_100_1000	(... ... ...)
A2_20410_PIKACHU_100_8000	What really went down that day?
A2_20410_RENTORAR_100_2000	(I don’t think this is the place for a long conversation.\nDo you?)
A2_20410_PIKACHU_100_9000	Now’s not the time, huh? Guess I’ll ask again later...\nWait—what the...?
A2_20410_PIKACHU_100_10000	There’s a Ditto on this list.
A2_20410_PIKACHU_100_11000	I didn’t see any Ditto in the detainment rooms.\nDid you?
A2_20410_RENTORAR_100_3000	(No, I’ve never seen one here.)
A2_20410_PIKACHU_100_12000	Hmm... Guess it was brought here before us. Maybe it\nalready got released.
A2_20410_PIKACHU_200_1000	It’s a list of all the incidents that Pokémon are\nsupposedly responsible for.
A2_20410_PIKACHU_200_2000	There’s a Ditto on the list, but I’ve never met\none here.
A2_20420_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a list of Pokémon that are wanted by the PPB.
A2_20420_PIKACHU_100_2000	But look at how many there are! Do they really intend\nto detain all these Pokémon?
A2_20420_PIKACHU_100_2500	Would this many even fit in the station?
A2_20420_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Is Mightyena’s name on the list?)
A2_20420_PIKACHU_100_3000	...Yeah, it says “Mightyena” right here.
A2_20420_RENTORAR_100_2000	(I see...)
A2_20420_PIKACHU_100_4000	How do you and Mightyena know each other,\nanyway?
A2_20420_RENTORAR_100_3000	(That...would take too long to explain.)
A2_20420_PIKACHU_100_5000	Really? Then we can circle back to that later.
A2_20420_PIKACHU_200_1000	This is a list of Pokémon the police plan to detain.
A2_20425_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Not this way—the humans will see us.)
A2_20425_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, whoops—that’s no good. Let’s turn back.
A2_20430_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, I think that’s all we need to see in this room.
A2_20435_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, we did a lot of investigating, but we still haven’t\nfound anything to prove my innocence...
A2_20435_PIKACHU_100_2000	And we learned a little more, but not enough to\nhelp us get outta this place.
A2_20435_PIKACHU_100_3000	I’d really like to keep exploring other areas, too, but...
A2_20435_RENTORAR_100_1000	(If we go somewhere with too many humans, we’ll\nget spotted.)
A2_20435_PIKACHU_100_4000	Yeah, I know that. But I’m really curious about Butler.
A2_20435_PIKACHU_100_5000	Somehow, I need to get a good look around the\nchief’s office up above us.
A2_20435_RENTORAR_100_2000	(Then let’s go. Where is this room you’re after?)
A2_20435_PIKACHU_100_6000	According to the floor plan, it’s on the second floor.\nLet’s go, but be careful.
A2_20437_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Not this way—the humans will see us.)
A2_20437_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, whoops—that’s no good. Let’s turn back.
A2_20440_PIKACHU_100_1000	The chief’s office is on this floor, just past the turn\ndown this hallway.
A2_20440_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Understood.)
A2_20442_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Not this way—the humans will see us.)
A2_20442_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, whoops—that’s no good. Let’s turn back.
A2_20444_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, where are you going? The chief’s office is on\nthis floor!
A2_20446_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Wait. We can’t go past here. There’s a human\nstanding guard.)
A2_20446_PIKACHU_100_1000	What? But the chief’s office is right in front of us!
A2_20446_PIKACHU_100_2000	I really want to investigate that room, but I guess\nthat’s not gonna be easy...
A2_20446_RENTORAR_100_2000	(Should we turn back?)
A2_20446_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hmm... I know! Can you see through ceilings and\nstuff too?
A2_20446_RENTORAR_100_3000	(Of course, but what of it?)
A2_20446_PIKACHU_100_4000	You can see the rooms below you from the roof, right?
A2_20446_RENTORAR_100_4000	(Ah, I see what you’re getting at. Quite the\nunderhanded scheme, there.)
A2_20446_PIKACHU_100_5000	Call it a “clever” scheme, at least.
A2_20446_PIKACHU_100_6000	Anyway, now that we’ve got a plan, let’s head up to\nthe roof!
A2_20446_PIKACHU_200_1000	Never mind this way! Let’s go up to the roof, Luxray!
A2_20450_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, we made it to the roof...and lucky for us, there’s\nno one else here.
A2_20450_RENTORAR_100_1000	(I can’t see all the way from here. I need to get a little\ncloser to the room.)
A2_20450_PIKACHU_100_2000	OK, then let’s stand directly above it. I think it was \nnear the center of the building.
A2_20455_PIKACHU_100_1000	Before heading back down, we need to look through\nthe roof and check out the chief’s office.
A2_20460_PIKACHU_100_1000	You should be able to see through to the chief’s\noffice from here, right?
A2_20460_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Yes, I’ll take a look.)
A2_20480_PIKACHU_100_1000	The safe in particular seems really suspicious. There’s\ngotta be something in there.
A2_20480_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Even my eyes can’t see inside that box very clearly.)
A2_20480_PIKACHU_100_2000	I guess I’ve gotta go see it for myself, then.
A2_20480_RENTORAR_100_2000	(But there’s a human in front of the room.)
A2_20480_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yeah, he looks like he’s standing guard. I don’t\nthink we can just wait till he leaves.
A2_20480_PIKACHU_100_4000	Then there’s only one option. I’ve gotta go through\nthat duct...
A2_20480_RENTORAR_100_3000	(Like you did in the detainment rooms?)
A2_20480_PIKACHU_100_5000	Yeah. I doubt that office duct is connected to the\nbasement duct system, but I should be able to reach\nit from the ducts on the first floor.
A2_20480_RENTORAR_100_4000	(I can’t fit in those ducts. Are you sure you’re ready\nto go on your own?)
A2_20480_PIKACHU_100_6000	What, you think I’m gonna slip up? Remember—I’m\nthe great Detective Pikachu!
A2_20480_RENTORAR_100_5000	(Heh. Indeed.)
A2_20480_PIKACHU_100_7000	Either way, I can’t go now because Butler’s in there.
A2_20480_PIKACHU_100_8000	Let’s head back to the detainment rooms for now.
A2_20480_RENTORAR_100_6000	(Yes, that sounds wise.)
A2_2050_TIM_100_1000	Thanks so much for arranging my visit with Pikachu,\nInspector.
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_100_1000	That was the least I could do! I take it you were able\nto see him?
A2_2050_TIM_100_2000	Yes, thanks to you. But...
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_100_2000	You don’t look too happy.
A2_2050_TIM_100_3000	Oh, I’m happy that I got to see him. But I feel like\nthere’s even more to worry about now...
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_100_3000	Did something happen?
A2_2050_TIM_100_4000	Before we get into that, Inspector, do you mind if I\nask you some questions?
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_100_4000	Of course I don’t mind. Go right ahead.
A2_2050_SEL_0_1000	About Pikachu’s detainment...
A2_2050_SEL_0_2000	About Chief Butler...
A2_2050_SEL_0_3000	About the cube-shaped device...
A2_2050_SEL_0_4000	About the Beedrill attack...
A2_2050_TIM_300_1000	Did you know that Pikachu was going to be detained,\nInspector?
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_300_1000	No, I was as surprised as you were!
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_300_2000	Apparently, Mayor Myers wants the PPB to detain\nmore Pokémon.
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_300_3000	So Chief Butler’s been detaining any Pokémon he\nthinks may be a problem.
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_300_4000	To be fair, the evidence he presents always makes for\nan open-and-shut case, so detaining the Pokémon\nisn’t without justification, but...
A2_2050_TIM_300_2000	But what? Is there something that bothers you?
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_300_5000	His aggressive approach is...concerning.
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_300_6000	He’s got the PPB rounding up Pokémon left and right,\nand they’re not even gathering testimonies from\nresidents—he won’t even allow it!
A2_2050_TIM_300_3000	Yeah, that’s what happened with Pikachu too...
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_300_7000	Not that the PPB should give anyone special\ntreatment, but even so...
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_300_8000	It just...it makes me wonder if this is really the way\nthey should be approaching this.
A2_2050_TIM_400_1000	Can you tell me more about Chief Butler?
A2_2050_TIM_400_2000	I saw you together this afternoon. Do you two usually\nwork together?
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_400_1000	Lately, yes, but it’s not like we’re shoulder-to-shoulder\nat every moment.
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_400_2000	Though, If I’m being honest, it does feel like he’s got\nhis eye on me...
A2_2050_TIM_400_3000	What do you mean by that?
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_400_3000	On the one hand, my job as a police inspector\nrequires me to cooperate with the Pokémon\nProtection Bureau.
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_400_4000	But on the other, I don’t agree with Butler’s methods...
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_400_5000	I’ve said as much to Butler, but he just dismisses me\nand carries on unchanged.
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_400_6000	This has happened several times, and I fear it’s made\nChief Butler a bit wary of me.
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_400_7000	Wary enough to keep an eye on me and make sure I\ndon’t do anything...unnecessary.
A2_2050_TIM_400_4000	Wow, sounds like things have been rough for you\ntoo, Inspector...
A2_2050_TIM_500_1000	When I met with Pikachu, I noticed a cube-shaped\ndevice of some kind on his back.
A2_2050_TIM_500_2000	Do you know what that thing was?
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_500_1000	Those devices are attached to all Pokémon that have\nbeen detained.
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_500_2000	I’ve been told they’re some sort of management tag\nfor keeping track of the detained Pokémon.
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_500_3000	But that’s all I know, unfortunately...
A2_2050_TIM_500_3000	What?! Even you don’t fully know what those\ndevices are?
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_500_4000	The PPB has a lot of secrets, and they don’t share\nthem with anyone—not even the police.
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_500_5000	Their security is watertight, too, so it’s hard for me to\ninvestigate them independently.
A2_2050_TIM_500_4000	So even you can’t find out more, huh...
A2_2050_TIM_600_1000	Do you know anything about all the commotion last\nnight, Inspector?
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_600_1000	Ah, you’re talking about those Beedrill going\nberserk, right?
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_600_2000	That’s under the PPB’s jurisdiction. The police haven’t\nbeen given any information about it.
A2_2050_TIM_600_2000	Interesting...
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_600_3000	We may cooperate with the PPB, but we’re largely\nkept in the dark about their operations and plans.
A2_2050_TIM_600_3000	Well, thanks. If anyone knew something, I thought\nit’d be you...
A2_2050_HOLIDAY_600_4000	I wish I could be more help.
A2_2050_TIM_600_4000	Oh, no, not at all! I understand the situation a bit\nbetter now, thanks to you.
A2_20505_RENTORAR_100_1000	(The exit’s on the first floor, correct?)
A2_20505_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, but first we’ve gotta go to the basement to let\nall the other Pokémon know about the escape.
A2_20505_RENTORAR_100_2000	(Got it. Let’s take care not to be seen as we go.)
A2_20505_GORONDA_100_1000	(I’ll distract the police. You can use that time\nto escape.)
A2_20505_GORONDA_100_2000	(I’ll catch up with you later.)
A2_20505_PIKACHU_100_2000	Sorry to ask it of you, but thanks, Pangoro!
A2_20520_LEPARDAS_100_1000	(Surely there’s no need to go back up to the roof?\nYou ought to be heading downstairs.)
A2_20530_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(Did you see how fast Pangoro got all those machines\noff everybody? It was mind-blowing!)
A2_20530_PIKACHU_100_1000	No kidding. That was some serious speed.
A2_20530_YAMIRAMI_100_2000	(And now we’re all bustin’ out, right? Even the\nPokémon in the other rooms?)
A2_20530_PIKACHU_100_2000	You better believe it. We’re headed for the\ndetainment rooms on floor B1 now.
A2_20540_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(Impidimp already went down ahead of us.)
A2_20550_GORONDA_100_1000	(I’ll stay and cover you. If any officers think they’re\ngetting past me, they’ve got another thing coming.)
A2_20550_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thanks! I owe you one, Pangoro!
A2_20560_GORONDA_100_1000	(Leave this area to me.)
A2_20570_LEPARDAS_100_1000	(How exciting. Our freedom is just around\nthe corner!)
A2_20570_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, but now’s not the time to let your guard down.
A2_20580_LEPARDAS_100_1000	(We can finally leave this horrible place, yes?)
A2_20590_BEROBA_100_1000	(Hey, Pikachu! I went and scouted out floor B1!)
A2_20590_BEROBA_100_2000	(Everyone’s inside the detainment rooms, and there’s\na newbie Mightyena that’s hurt!)
A2_20590_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Mightyena... So his wounds haven’t fully\nhealed yet...)
A2_20590_PIKACHU_100_1000	I see... Why don’t we swing by and check on him?\nI know you’re worried!
A2_20600_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(C’mon! Down to the basement already!)
A2_20610_BEROBA_100_1000	(By the way, how are you gonna let the other\nPokémon outta their rooms?)
A2_20610_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s easy. We already know how to unlock\nthe doors!
A2_20620_RENTORAR_100_1000	(There’s nothing for us back up there.)
A2_20630_RENTORAR_100_1000	(The exit is this way, but we’re not leaving until the\nothers have been freed.)
A2_20640_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like there aren’t any officers in the guardroom.
A2_20640_PIKACHU_100_2000	Better take this opportunity to unlock the doors.\nLemme see... 2168...
A2_20640_RENTORAR_100_1000	(The detainment room doors are unlocked\nnow, right?)
A2_20640_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yeah. Let’s go round everyone up for our escape.
A2_20650_RENTORAR_100_1000	(We haven’t talked to all the Pokémon yet.)
A2_20660_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, everyone! I know this is sudden, but now’s our\nchance to escape!
A2_20660_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Everyone needs to go upstairs and head for the exit.)
A2_20660_YOKUBARISU_100_1000	(R-really? Oh, hooray!)
A2_20660_MIRUHOG_100_1000	(Aww, thanks for coming to let us know, Pikachu!)
A2_20660_DEDENNE_100_1000	(Hmph, I’m not gonna take Pikachu’s word for it! He’s\nprobably trying to trap me again!)
A2_20660_PIKACHU_100_2000	It’s the truth, Dedenne. You gotta believe me.
A2_20660_GRAENA_100_1000	(... ... ...)
A2_20660_RENTORAR_100_2000	(Are you OK, Mightyena?)
A2_20660_GRAENA_100_2000	(Luxray... It’s your fault that I was injured and then\ncaptured by the police.)
A2_20660_RENTORAR_100_3000	(No, you misunderstand. Our fight was a set up.\nIt was orchestrated by some villainous humans.)
A2_20660_GRAENA_100_3000	(...You’re blaming HUMANS?)
A2_20660_PIKACHU_100_3000	This Luxray here isn’t the one who fought with\nyou, Mightyena.
A2_20660_PIKACHU_100_4000	It was a Ditto. It was forced to use Transform to pose\nas Luxray.
A2_20660_GRAENA_100_4000	(You don’t expect me to believe that ridiculous—)
A2_20660_RENTORAR_100_4000	(Believe what you want, but now is your chance to\nescape. Please, come with us.)
A2_20660_GRAENA_100_5000	(...Fine. But I can’t walk too quickly. My leg hurts.)
A2_20660_GRAENA_100_6000	(You go on ahead. I’ll catch up afterward.)
A2_20660_DEDENNE_100_2000	(If this is a lie, you’re gonna pay for it—believe me!)
A2_20660_MIRUHOG_100_2000	(We’ll take care of Mightyena! You go on ahead!)
A2_20660_PIKACHU_100_5000	Thanks.
A2_20660_RENTORAR_100_5000	(Yes...thanks. And Mightyena, I better see you\nout there.)
A2_20670_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Inteleon! Morpeko! I know this is sudden, but\nnow’s our chance to escape!
A2_20670_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Head to the exit, both of you.)
A2_20670_INTEREON_100_1000	(I appreciate the help. I’m glad we can finally leave\nthis place.)
A2_20670_RENTORAR_100_2000	(Liepard and Pangoro are distracting the police\nofficers.)
A2_20670_RENTORAR_100_3000	(But they can’t keep it up for long. So we need you to\nhurry.)
A2_20670_INTEREON_100_2000	(That’s a bit of a problem. Morpeko’s too hungry right\nnow and not in the best mood.)
A2_20670_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_100_1000	(I’m. So. HUUUNGRYYY!)
A2_20670_INTEREON_100_3000	(I’ll watch over Morpeko until he calms down.\nYou two go on ahead.)
A2_20670_PIKACHU_100_2000	Ah, OK. Sorry about that, Inteleon.
A2_20670_RENTORAR_100_4000	(We’ll head out now. Make sure you follow us later.)
A2_20680_GRAENA_100_1000	(Indeedee patched me up some, but it still hurts\nsomething fierce.)
A2_20690_DEDENNE_100_1000	(Hmm... Should I go? Or should I stay?)
A2_20700_YOKUBARISU_100_1000	(The Berries outside are so close I can almost\ntaste ’em!)
A2_20710_MIRUHOG_100_1000	(We can’t abandon the injured!)
A2_20720_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_100_1000	(I’m. So. HUUUNGRYYY!)
A2_20730_INTEREON_100_1000	(I’ll take care of Morpeko.)
A2_20740_PIKACHU_100_1000	Now that we’ve talked to everyone, let’s get going.
A2_20742_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(Hee hee hee! We’re finally gonna blow this joint!)
A2_20742_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Don’t celebrate just yet, Sableye. Stay sharp until this\nis over.)
A2_20743_BEROBA_100_1000	(Is Mightyena OK?)
A2_20743_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, don’t worry. Watchog and the others are\nwith him.
A2_20745_PIKACHU_100_1000	My partner’s waiting in the first-floor lobby. Think we\ncan make it that far?
A2_20745_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Of course. You think I’ve come this far just to fail?\nLeave this to me.)
A2_20745_PIKACHU_100_2000	I knew I could depend on you! All right, Luxray!\nLet’s go!
A2_20750_PIKACHU_100_1000	All that’s left to do is to get to the lobby.
A2_20750_RENTORAR_100_1000	(We can’t go this way. There’s a human at the end of\nthe hall. We’ll have to go another way.)
A2_20750_PIKACHU_100_2000	Then let’s go through the reference room! It should\nconnect up to another hallway!
A2_20750_RENTORAR_100_2000	(Understood.)
A2_20760_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(There are lots of police on this floor, right, Luxray?)
A2_20760_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Yes. I doubt we could force our way through\nthem all.)
A2_20760_RENTORAR_100_2000	(I’ll look through the walls so that we can move\nwhen the officers aren’t watching.)
A2_20760_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s all up to you, Luxray.
A2_20770_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(I wish I could ride on Luxray’s back, too...)
A2_20780_BEROBA_100_1000	(The exit to the outside is on this floor, right?)
A2_20780_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, that’s right. You’ll be able to see your partner\nagain!
A2_20780_BEROBA_100_2000	(Yay! I can’t wait to play pranks on him again!)
A2_20790_BEROBA_100_1000	(Let’s get out of here as soon as we can!)
A2_20795_RENTORAR_100_1000	(We’ve already informed all the Pokémon in the\ndetainment rooms. Let’s head toward the exit now.)
A2_2080_BUTLER_100_1000	Well, if it isn’t the young detective! What a surprise.
A2_2080_TIM_100_1000	Evening, Chief Butler...
A2_2080_HOLIDAY_100_1000	Can I help you with something, Chief?
A2_2080_BUTLER_100_2000	No, I just happened to be passing by.
A2_2080_BUTLER_100_3000	But while I’m here, Inspector Holiday...I hope you’re\nnot making rash decisions without consulting me first.
A2_2080_HOLIDAY_100_2000	...Wouldn’t dream of it.
A2_2080_BUTLER_100_4000	Glad to hear it. After all, it’s vital that the Bureau and\nthe police both follow proper procedure.
A2_2080_BUTLER_100_5000	In any case, I’ll excuse myself now.
A2_2080_TIM_100_2000	...I find it hard to believe he just “happened to be\npassing by” at this exact moment.
A2_2080_HOLIDAY_100_3000	This is what I mean when I say he’s got his eye on me.
A2_2080_HOLIDAY_100_4000	You be careful out there, Tim.
A2_2080_HOLIDAY_100_5000	Nothing good will come of it if Chief Butler sets his\nsights on you...
A2_2080_TIM_100_3000	So that’s what you’ve been trying to tell me.
A2_2080_HOLIDAY_100_6000	I’m worried about you and Pikachu.
A2_2080_HOLIDAY_100_7000	Unfortunately, I can’t do much to openly help you in\nmy current situation.
A2_2080_HOLIDAY_100_8000	But I know you’ll figure out how to prove Pikachu’s\ninnocence. I believe in you.
A2_2080_TIM_100_4000	Thank you, Inspector!
A2_2080_HOLIDAY_100_9000	Well, I’ll see you later, Tim.
A2_20820_PIKACHU_100_1000	Gotta try again!
A2_20830_RENTORAR_100_1000	(We can’t go this way—there’s an officer straight\nahead.)
A2_20833_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, where do we go from here?
A2_20837_RENTORAR_100_1000	(We can’t take that hallway. The police are right\nthere!)
A2_20837_PIKACHU_100_1000	Isn’t there SOMEWHERE we can go?!
A2_20837_RENTORAR_100_2000	(The room in the back... There are humans in there\ntoo, but there are also many places to hide.)
A2_20837_PIKACHU_100_2000	Then I guess that’s our only choice!
A2_20837_RENTORAR_100_3000	(All right. Here we go!)
A2_20837_PIKACHU_100_3000	Just a little bit farther and we’re home free... Hold on,\nTim, I’m coming!
A2_20840_RENTORAR_100_1000	(We can’t go this way—there’s an officer straight\nahead.)
A2_20850_RENTORAR_100_1000	(We can’t go this way—there’s an officer straight\nahead.)
A2_20860_RENTORAR_100_1000	(We can’t go this way—there’s an officer straight\nahead.)
A2_20870_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, we’re almost outta here!
A2_20870_RENTORAR_100_1000	(There are still humans out there.)
A2_20870_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh...it’s Butler and Brad!
A2_2090_PAPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	The streets can be dangerous at night. You should get\nhome soon.
A2_2095_TIM_100_1000	The Slowpoke statue’s still broken.
A2_2095_TIM_100_2000	I need to figure out who did this—and soon...
A2_2100_TIM_100_1000	I don’t think there’s any point in going this way.
A2_2110_TIM_100_1000	I don’t think there’s any point in going this way\nright now.
A2_2120_TIM_100_1000	I don’t think there’s any point in going this way.
A2_2130_TIM_100_1000	I don’t think there’s any point in going this way\nright now.
A2_2140_TIM_100_1000	I don’t think there’s any point in going this way.
A2_2145_TIM_100_1000	Oh, good! I knew there would still be customers here.
A2_2145_TIM_100_2000	I should ask around and see if anyone can tell me\nmore about the Pokémon being detained.
A2_2150_PABLO_100_1000	Oh, Tim, you’re back! But...Pikachu still hasn’t been\nreleased, eh?
A2_2150_TIM_100_1000	Not yet, no...
A2_2150_TIM_100_2000	But I know he’s innocent. If the culprit was a Pikachu,\nit must have been a different one!
A2_2150_TIM_100_3000	Are you aware of any other Pikachu in the city?
A2_2150_PABLO_100_2000	Hmm... Not off the top of my head, no.
A2_2150_TIM_100_4000	Yeah, I thought as much...
A2_2150_PABLO_100_3000	Sorry I can’t be of more help.
A2_2150_TIM_100_5000	No, it’s OK. Just talking about this with you is really\nhelping me out.
A2_2150_TIM_100_6000	Speaking of which, there are a few other things I’d\nlike to ask...
A2_2150_PABLO_100_4000	Sure! What’s on your mind?
A2_2150_PABLO_200_1000	Something you wanna ask me?
A2_2150_SEL_0_1000	When Pokémon were detained...
A2_2150_SEL_0_2000	About the Hi-Hat Café...
A2_2150_TIM_300_1000	Have you seen the police detain any Pokémon,\nby chance?
A2_2150_PABLO_300_1000	Nah, I spend most of my time here in the café.
A2_2150_PABLO_300_2000	But my customers might have seen something.
A2_2150_TIM_300_2000	Thanks. I’ll ask them.
A2_2150_PABLO_300_3000	Good luck, Tim.
A2_2150_TIM_400_1000	Looks like you’re pretty busy even at night.
A2_2150_PABLO_400_1000	Yeah, and I’m very thankful for that!
A2_2150_PABLO_400_2000	You know, there are some Pokémon singing on the\nstage in the back.
A2_2150_PABLO_400_3000	They usually play rock, but it sounds like tonight\nthey’re doing ballads.
A2_2150_PABLO_400_4000	I’m sure your investigation is keeping you busy, but if\nyou’ve got some spare time, feel free to hang out and\nhear them perform!
A2_2150_TIM_400_2000	I didn’t know there were Pokémon like that here in\nRyme City.
A2_2150_PABLO_400_5000	They’re all friends of Ludicolo!
A2_2150_PABLO_400_6000	I’m glad that so many Pokémon enjoy my humble\nlittle café.
A2_2160_PABUSINESSMAN02_100_1000	Ahhh, this is nice. Another amazing performance\nfrom Politoed’s band tonight!
A2_2160_TIM_100_1000	Excuse me. May I ask you a few questions?
A2_2160_PABUSINESSMAN02_100_2000	Hm? What can I do for you?
A2_2160_PABUSINESSMAN02_200_1000	What can I do for you?
A2_2160_SEL_0_1000	About Pikachu...
A2_2160_SEL_0_2000	When Pokémon were detained...
A2_2160_SEL_0_3000	About the Hi-Hat Café...
A2_2160_TIM_300_1000	Have you seen any Pikachu around the city? Other\nthan Detective Pikachu, I mean!
A2_2160_PABUSINESSMAN02_300_1000	Oh, well, I see Detective Pikachu right here in this\ncafé all the time!
A2_2160_PABUSINESSMAN02_300_2000	As for other Pikachu... No, I can’t think of any.
A2_2160_TIM_300_2000	Got it. Thanks.
A2_2160_TIM_400_1000	Have you witnessed any Pokémon being detained?
A2_2160_PABUSINESSMAN02_400_1000	Yeah, I have! I saw a police officer taking an\nImpidimp away.
A2_2160_TIM_400_2000	Did you happen to see some kind of a cube-shaped\ndevice as well?
A2_2160_PABUSINESSMAN02_400_2000	Oh yeah, definitely! The police officer got one out.
A2_2160_PABUSINESSMAN02_400_3000	<color=#F39800FF>The Impidimp looked really happy! Practically\nsnatched the thing right out of the officer’s hands,\nit was so excited!</color>
A2_2160_TIM_400_3000	It was? Uh... Must’ve been a pretty carefree\nImpidimp, then...
A2_2160_TIM_500_1000	Do you come to this café often?
A2_2160_PABUSINESSMAN02_500_1000	Yeah! You can’t beat the food and the music here!
A2_2160_PABUSINESSMAN02_500_2000	Politoed’s band is great, don’t you think? They can\ndo everything—rock, jazz, ballads, you name it!\nThey’ve got amazing range!
A2_2170_TIM_100_1000	Excuse me. May I ask you a few questions?
A2_2170_PKBUSINESSWOMAN01_100_1000	Whaddya want? I’m trying to enjoy the show!
A2_2170_TIM_100_2000	I’m investigating last night’s incident and was hoping\nyou could answer a few questions...
A2_2170_PKBUSINESSWOMAN01_100_2000	Well, OK. I suppose I can help you with that.
A2_2170_PKBUSINESSWOMAN01_200_1000	Is there something you wanted to ask?
A2_2170_SEL_0_1000	About Pikachu...
A2_2170_SEL_0_2000	When Pokémon were detained...
A2_2170_SEL_0_3000	About the Hi-Hat Café...
A2_2170_TIM_300_1000	Have you ever seen a Pikachu around this city?
A2_2170_PKBUSINESSWOMAN01_300_1000	If you mean the famous Detective Pikachu, then yes!
A2_2170_TIM_300_2000	But have you seen any other Pikachu?
A2_2170_PKBUSINESSWOMAN01_300_2000	No, I haven’t...
A2_2170_TIM_300_3000	OK, thanks anyway.
A2_2170_TIM_300_4000	Maybe there really is only one Pikachu in the city...
A2_2170_TIM_400_1000	Have you witnessed any Pokémon being detained?
A2_2170_PKBUSINESSWOMAN01_400_1000	Yes, I saw a Pangoro being taken into custody.
A2_2170_PKBUSINESSWOMAN01_400_2000	At first I was scared of Pangoro because of its size,\nbut it turned out to be surprisingly cute.
A2_2170_PKBUSINESSWOMAN01_400_3000	While it was walking with the police officer, Pangoro\nwas waving its hands like it was dancing.
A2_2170_TIM_400_2000	Wait... Dancing?!
A2_2170_PKBUSINESSWOMAN01_400_4000	<color=#F39800FF>Yes. It flapped its hands around for a little while,\njust like it was dancing!</color>
A2_2170_TIM_400_3000	Why would Pangoro do that?
A2_2170_PKBUSINESSWOMAN01_400_5000	I really couldn’t tell you.
A2_2170_TIM_400_4000	Fair enough. That’s a strange story, though.
A2_2170_TIM_500_1000	Do you come to this café often?
A2_2170_PKBUSINESSWOMAN01_500_1000	Yes, I love the coffee here.
A2_2170_PKBUSINESSWOMAN01_500_2000	Pablo really knows his stuff. When I brew my own\ncoffee, it never tastes as good as his does.
A2_2180_TIM_100_1000	Excuse me. May I ask you a few questions?
A2_2180_PCWOMAN02_100_1000	Uh, sure. What do you want?
A2_2180_PCWOMAN02_200_1000	What do you want?
A2_2180_SEL_0_1000	About Pikachu...
A2_2180_SEL_0_2000	When Pokémon were detained...
A2_2180_SEL_0_3000	About the Hi-Hat Café...
A2_2180_TIM_300_1000	Have you ever seen a Pikachu around this city?
A2_2180_PCWOMAN02_300_1000	If you’re asking about Detective Pikachu, I’ve seen\nhim on the news a few times...
A2_2180_TIM_300_2000	I’m looking for a regular Pikachu, not the detective.
A2_2180_PCWOMAN02_300_2000	Then I’m afraid I can’t help you. Sorry...
A2_2180_TIM_300_3000	Oh, no need to apologize! I appreciate your time.
A2_2180_TIM_400_1000	Have you witnessed any Pokémon being detained?
A2_2180_PCWOMAN02_400_1000	Yes... I saw a group of Pokémon—three, I believe—\ngetting rounded up and taken away.
A2_2180_TIM_400_2000	Did you happen to see some kind of a cube-shaped\ndevice as well?
A2_2180_PCWOMAN02_400_2000	I did, now that you mention it. One of the police\nofficers attached some to the Pokémon’s backs...
A2_2180_PCWOMAN02_400_3000	The Pokémon resisted at first, but they calmed down\nonce those devices were on them.
A2_2180_PCWOMAN02_400_4000	<color=#F39800FF>It was strange how they all went quiet so suddenly...</color>
A2_2180_TIM_400_3000	That does sound kind of unnatural. I wonder what\nthose devices are...
A2_2180_TIM_500_1000	Do you come to this café often?
A2_2180_PCWOMAN02_500_1000	I saw it showcased on TV a little while ago, so I came\nto check it out.
A2_2180_PCWOMAN02_500_2000	This is my first time here, but it really is a nice place,\nisn’t it?
A2_2180_PCWOMAN02_500_3000	The coffee’s great, and that Ludicolo is so cute...\nYes, I’m pretty sure I’ll be back.
A2_2190_RUNPAPPA_100_1000	Ludi!
A2_2200_TIM_100_1000	The news is on. Sounds like more and more Pokémon\nhave been causing problems.
A2_2200_TIM_100_2000	And the police have been detaining a lot of Pokémon.\nPikachu’s definitely not the only one...
A2_2200_TIM_100_3000	But there’s nothing in the news about Pikachu’s\ndetainment yet.
A2_2210_TIM_100_1000	I can’t leave the café yet. I’m not done here.
A2_2210_TIM_100_2000	Once I’ve interviewed everyone I can, my next step is\nto make some deductions.
A2_2220_TIM_100_1000	Well, it’s getting late. I guess I’ll continue my\ninvestigation tomorrow...
A2_2220_PABLO_100_1000	Yeah, you’ve had a long day, Tim.
A2_2220_PABLO_100_2000	Both you and the police have been burning the\nmidnight oil lately—I’m impressed.
A2_2220_TIM_100_2000	Oh? Were the police here?
A2_2220_PABLO_100_3000	Yeah, I saw Brad for a moment. He said he was going\nto Fountain Plaza.
A2_2220_TIM_100_3000	Oh, really... Maybe I’ll talk to Brad before I go home.
A2_2230_TIM_100_1000	What are you doing working out here so late?
A2_2230_BRAD_100_1000	Why, hello there, “Great Detective.” I’ve finished my\nwork for today, actually...
A2_2230_BRAD_100_2000	I just thought I’d unwind a bit by gazing at the\nfountain before heading home.
A2_2230_BRAD_100_3000	Shame someone went and broke the statue, though...
A2_2230_TIM_100_2000	With all due respect, Brad, Pikachu didn’t do this.
A2_2230_BRAD_100_4000	Is that so. And? What are YOU doing out here at\nthis hour?
A2_2230_TIM_100_3000	I’m trying to figure out what really happened in this\ncase—and to find the real culprit.
A2_2230_BRAD_100_5000	Well, good luck with that.
A2_2230_TIM_100_4000	Brad, wait—please. You came here this afternoon too,\ndidn’t you?
A2_2230_BRAD_100_6000	So you saw me.
A2_2230_BRAD_100_7000	Do you—? Actually, no... Hmm...
A2_2230_LIVOLT01_100_1000	Manec?
A2_2230_TIM_100_5000	What is it, Brad?
A2_2230_BRAD_100_8000	Oh, nothing. I think I’ll be going home now.
A2_2230_BRAD_100_9000	After all, tomorrow’s bound to be another busy day...\nSo many Pokémon to detain, so little time.
A2_2230_BRAD_100_10000	You’d better get home soon too. A kid like you\nshouldn’t be out past his bedtime.
A2_2230_LIVOLT01_100_2000	Manec.
A2_2230_TIM_100_6000	Brad looked like he was about to say something but\nchanged his mind...
A2_2230_TIM_100_7000	And he seemed to be deep in thought about\nsomething...which isn’t like him at all.
A2_2230_TIM_100_8000	It does make me curious, but it doesn’t change what\nI have to do.
A2_2230_TIM_100_9000	I just need to keep investigating this case.
A2_2230_TIM_100_10000	But as much as I’d like to keep examining the scene,\nFountain Plaza’s gotten so dark that I doubt I’d find\nany new evidence...
A2_2230_TIM_100_11000	I’ll call it a day and start up again tomorrow.
A2_2230_TIM_100_12000	That’s when I’ll track down the real culprit and solve\nthis case!
A2_2310_PIKACHU_100_1000	Ngh... Is it morning already? Owww... This sure isn’t\nthe most comfortable place I’ve ever slept.
A2_2310_PIKACHU_100_2000	But I guess complaining’s not gonna get me outta\nhere any quicker.
A2_2310_PIKACHU_100_3000	Tim’s working hard to prove my innocence.
A2_2310_PIKACHU_100_4000	I need to do what I can from the inside.
A2_2310_PIKACHU_100_5000	Just watch, Tim! This great detective’s gonna find\nsome even-greater evidence!
A2_2320_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(Gyahaha! Rough first day, huh? That’s whatcha get\nfor talking back to Luxray!)
A2_2320_PIKACHU_100_1000	I wasn’t expecting him to be so strong...
A2_2320_YAMIRAMI_100_2000	(If you know what’s good for you, you’ll keep that\nbig mouth of yours shut!)
A2_2330_GORONDA_100_1000	(Do you remember...meeting before? Not here...\nSomewhere else, a long time ago.)
A2_2330_PIKACHU_100_1000	Nope. Pretty sure I don’t know any Pangoro.
A2_2330_GORONDA_100_2000	(Really? Sorry...I must be thinking of someone else.)
A2_2330_PIKACHU_100_2000	It’s really dim and humid down here, by the way.\nI know we’re in the police station, but which floor?
A2_2330_GORONDA_100_3000	(We’re in the basement. All the Pokémon are locked\nup down here.)
A2_2330_PIKACHU_100_3000	How many floors does the station have?
A2_2330_GORONDA_100_4000	(I don’t know. But I do know that there are humans\non the floor above us.)
A2_2330_PIKACHU_100_4000	Figures. Is there any way to get outta this room?
A2_2330_PIKACHU_100_5000	The list of things I wanna investigate is getting longer\nby the minute.
A2_2330_GORONDA_100_5000	(You still wanna make waves, even after what\nhappened yesterday?)
A2_2330_PIKACHU_100_6000	If a little zap could scare me off, I never would’ve\nbecome the great detective standing before you.
A2_2330_GORONDA_100_6000	(You’re a funny guy.)
A2_2330_GORONDA_100_7000	(Well, whatever you’re planning, you oughta talk to\nLuxray about it first.)
A2_2330_GORONDA_100_8000	(He’s been here longer than I have, so he knows more\nabout the place.)
A2_2330_PIKACHU_100_7000	Wow, just the guy I wanted to talk to...
A2_2330_GORONDA_100_9000	(You gonna chicken out?)
A2_2330_PIKACHU_100_8000	Don’t make me laugh! Just you watch—I’ll have him\nconvinced in two shakes of my tail!
A2_2330_GORONDA_100_10000	(Yeah, that’s the spirit. Good luck.)
A2_2340_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, I wanna talk to Luxray. How can I make that\nhappen?
A2_2340_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(You think Luxray wants to talk to the likes of YOU?!\nForget about it! Not gonna happen!)
A2_2340_PIKACHU_100_2000	I thought you might say that. What say we settle this\nwith a contest, Sableye?
A2_2340_YAMIRAMI_100_2000	(A contest?)
A2_2340_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yeah. But no fighting—we’re in a police station, after\nall. This’ll be a battle of wits between you and me.
A2_2340_PIKACHU_100_4000	If you win, then I’ll keep quiet—just like you want.\nBut if I win...
A2_2340_YAMIRAMI_100_3000	(Bold words for a newbie! OK, you’re on!)
A2_2340_YAMIRAMI_100_4000	(I’m gonna hide three jewels around the bed. All you\ngotta do is look for them.)
A2_2340_YAMIRAMI_100_5000	(Find all three, and I’ll let you talk to Luxray.)
A2_2340_PIKACHU_100_5000	Are you sure that’s how you wanna play this? I’m a\ndetective, y’know—finding things is my whole shtick.
A2_2340_YAMIRAMI_100_6000	(And hiding things is mine! You could serve out a\nlife sentence and still never find them!)
A2_2340_YAMIRAMI_100_7000	(Now turn away and close your eyes!)
A2_2340_YAMIRAMI_100_8000	(OK, you can open ’em again! Now find those\njewels—if you can!)
A2_2350_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(Did you find the jewels?)
A2_2350_PIKACHU_100_1000	You bet I did—every last one! Whaddya think\nof THAT?!
A2_2350_YAMIRAMI_100_1500	(Wh-whaaat?! I never thought you’d find all three...)
A2_2350_PIKACHU_100_2000	Now you’re gonna keep your promise and tell Luxray\nI wanna talk to him, right?
A2_2350_YAMIRAMI_100_2000	(I probably don’t even have to tell him.)
A2_2350_YAMIRAMI_100_3000	(This is Luxray we’re talking about. He can see\nthrough walls, you know—he’s probably watching\nour room as we speak.)
A2_2350_PIKACHU_100_3000	See through walls, huh? Bet that comes in handy.
A2_2350_PIKACHU_100_4000	All I need now is a way to reach Luxray’s room.
A2_2350_YAMIRAMI_100_4000	(You could just talk to him on the roof.)
A2_2350_PIKACHU_100_5000	Nah, I don’t have time to wait for that. There’s gotta\nbe another way...
A2_2355_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(Did you find the jewels?)
A2_2355_PIKACHU_100_1000	Gimme a sec—I’m still looking!
A2_2355_YAMIRAMI_100_2000	(Sure. Stall all you want, but I bet you give up before\nyou find them all! Ehehehe!)
A2_2355_PIKACHU_100_2000	You’d like that, wouldn’t you. But I’ll show you what\nthis great detective can do!
A2_2360_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, now to search for those jewels. There should be\nthree in all.
A2_2370_PIKACHU_100_1000	I found the jewels, but there might still be places I\ncan check.
A2_2380_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s detectin’ time!
A2_2380_PIKACHU_200_1000	Let’s see... Where haven’t I looked yet?
A2_2390_PIKACHU_5000_1000	I still haven’t found all three jewels... Not yet, anyway.
A2_2400_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wow, he hid a jewel here? Kinda feels like he’s\nmaking fun of me...
A2_2410_PIKACHU_100_1000	Aha! Here’s one!
A2_2430_PIKACHU_100_1000	A toy box, eh? There sure is a lot of stuff inside.
A2_2430_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’ll try to get a look at it from a different angle.
A2_2440_PIKACHU_100_1000	These plush toys are shaped like Berries. I hope\nnobody mistakenly tries to eat ’em!
A2_2450_PIKACHU_100_1000	All right! Found ya!
A2_2480_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like there’s nothing more to see here.
A2_2490_PIKACHU_100_1000	This oughta be all the jewels.
A2_2500_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hmm... That looks like a duct. You think I could get\ninto another room through it?
A2_2500_PIKACHU_100_2000	The problem is getting up there... I can’t just climb up\nlike with Exeggutor...
A2_2500_GORONDA_100_1000	(You’re hopeless...)
A2_2520_PIKACHU_100_1000	No point in going back now. First I need to talk\nto Luxray.
A2_2530_BEROBA_100_1000	(Oh, you’re that weak little newbie from yesterday.\nWhat’d you come in here for?)
A2_2530_PIKACHU_100_1000	You act so high and mighty...but I bet you’re not really\nthat strong.
A2_2530_BEROBA_100_2000	(Stronger’n you, at least!)
A2_2530_BEROBA_100_3000	(Some more newbies got brought to the other rooms\ntoday, but I bet none of ’em are as weak as you!)
A2_2530_PIKACHU_100_2000	There are more rooms? I wonder what’s in them.
A2_2540_LEPARDAS_100_1000	(Luxray has been waiting for you.)
A2_2550_RENTORAR_100_1000	(So you’ve come, Pikachu.)
A2_2550_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hi, Luxray. Thanks for that electrifying introduction\nyesterday.
A2_2550_RENTORAR_100_2000	(You talk too much. And yet...perhaps you’re not\nALL talk.)
A2_2550_RENTORAR_100_3000	(I saw what you did with Sableye. It looks like you do\nhave a brain in your head, at least.)
A2_2550_PIKACHU_100_2000	I see you’ve finally recognized what I’m capable of!
A2_2550_RENTORAR_100_4000	(Well? Didn’t you have something to discuss\nwith me?)
A2_2550_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yeah. Something fishy’s going on in this station, and\nit stinks.
A2_2550_PIKACHU_100_4000	I wanna solve this mystery and prove my innocence.
A2_2550_RENTORAR_100_5000	(You think you can do that?)
A2_2550_PIKACHU_100_5000	I don’t think I can, I know I can—at least, if I have my\npartner and all of you working together with me.
A2_2550_RENTORAR_100_6000	(Is that so? Well, then...why not?)
A2_2550_PIKACHU_100_6000	Wow, you didn’t take much convincing. I feel like I got\nall worked up for nothing!
A2_2550_RENTORAR_100_7000	(I have my own motives.)
A2_2550_RENTORAR_100_8000	(I merely thought that working together may help me\nachieve my goals. That’s all.)
A2_2550_PIKACHU_100_7000	Then why weren’t you friendlier to begin with?
A2_2550_RENTORAR_100_9000	(If I invited every newcomer to join my cause, I would\nsoon find myself burdened by incompetence.)
A2_2550_PIKACHU_100_8000	So you were testing me, huh? I’m not sure you and I\nare gonna get along too well.
A2_2550_RENTORAR_100_10000	(So, what do you plan to do now?)
A2_2550_PIKACHU_100_9000	First, I need some information. What can you tell me?
A2_2550_RENTORAR_100_11000	(More newcomers arrived today.)
A2_2550_RENTORAR_100_12000	(There are two more detainment rooms apart from\nours. It appears they were put in there.)
A2_2550_PIKACHU_100_10000	Some newly detained Pokémon? The plot thickens...
A2_2550_RENTORAR_100_13000	(Wait, Pikachu—enough talk for now.)
A2_2550_RENTORAR_100_14000	(A human is coming this way. Go back to your room\nat once.)
A2_2550_PIKACHU_100_11000	Sure. Thanks for the warning, Luxray. That vision of\nyours really is somethin’ else.
A2_2550_RENTORAR_100_15000	(This is no time for idle banter. Hurry.)
A2_2550_PIKACHU_100_12000	OK, OK, see you later, then.
A2_2560_BUTLER_100_1000	Hmph. Looks like you’re behaving.
A2_2560_PIKACHU_100_1000	Isn’t that...Butler? Why would the chief come down\nhere himself?
A2_2560_BUTLER_100_2000	I heard there was a bit of a tussle yesterday, but it\nlooks like Pikachu’s not injured.
A2_2560_PIKACHU_100_2000	Were you worried about me? Awww, shucks.
A2_2560_BUTLER_100_3000	...Argh, what a hassle!
A2_2560_PIKACHU_100_3000	Huh?
A2_2560_BUTLER_100_4000	Grgh... I’m sick of this.
A2_2560_PIKACHU_100_4000	What’s going on? It’s like he suddenly flipped a\npersonality switch!
A2_2560_BUTLER_100_5000	Why do I have to go out of my way to personally\ncheck on him?
A2_2560_BUTLER_100_6000	What a waste of time. It’s just one measly Pikachu...
A2_2560_PIKACHU_100_5000	Hey, watch what you’re sayin’ about me!
A2_2560_BUTLER_100_7000	Oh, shut up! “Pika pika” all you want—no one’s\ncoming to rescue you!
A2_2560_BUTLER_100_8000	Read my lips—you’re never getting out of here!
A2_2560_PIKACHU_100_6000	What was all that about? He was like a totally\ndifferent person from the guy we met before.
A2_2560_PIKACHU_100_7000	The mysteries just keep piling up in this place.
A2_2560_PIKACHU_100_8000	But at least he’s gone now. Time to get back to the\ninvestigation!
A2_2560_PIKACHU_100_9000	I’ll go visit the new Pokémon that just got brought\nin today.
A2_2570_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(So you’re in good with Luxray, huh? Nice work,\nPikachu! I knew you could do it!)
A2_2570_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wow, talk about an attitude adjustment...
A2_2570_YAMIRAMI_100_2000	(An adjustment you’ve earned! C’mon, I’ll tell you\nanything you wanna know—since we’re pals and all.)
A2_2570_YAMIRAMI_200_1000	(Ask me anything!)
A2_2570_SEL_0_1000	About you, Sableye...
A2_2570_SEL_0_2000	Why were you brought here?
A2_2570_SEL_0_3000	Anything on your mind?
A2_2570_PIKACHU_300_1000	So, Sableye, tell me a bit about yourself.
A2_2570_YAMIRAMI_300_1000	(I can eat gems! Some call it a skill, but that’s just how\nI enjoy those tasty treats!)
A2_2570_PIKACHU_300_2000	Wow, that’s amazing! You must have some awfully\nstrong teeth.
A2_2570_PIKACHU_400_1000	What’re you in for, Sableye?
A2_2570_YAMIRAMI_400_1000	(A while back, a human suddenly snatched me and\nbrought me here.)
A2_2570_PIKACHU_400_2000	Same with me. But what did you do?
A2_2570_YAMIRAMI_400_2000	(I dunno what I did. I guess that human just felt like\nputting me here.)
A2_2570_YAMIRAMI_500_1000	(Well, I can’t eat any gems here, which has been\nbugging me a lot lately. And, well...)
A2_2570_PIKACHU_500_1000	Yeah? Go on.
A2_2570_YAMIRAMI_500_2000	(I guess I just wish Luxray would lean on me a\n little more.)
A2_2570_YAMIRAMI_500_3000	(I wanna help him out, but Luxray seems to have\nsomething else on his mind.)
A2_2570_PIKACHU_500_2000	Huh, you’re a surprisingly good guy underneath it all.\nSo you’re worried about Luxray?
A2_2570_YAMIRAMI_500_4000	(Whaddya mean, “surprisingly”?! I’m allowed to be\nworried about someone—what’s wrong with that?!)
A2_2570_PIKACHU_500_3000	Easy, easy. Don’t get so heated. I’ll go see what\nLuxray has to say, OK?
A2_2580_GORONDA_100_1000	(Sounds like you were able to talk to Luxray.)
A2_2580_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, thanks for your help with that.
A2_2580_GORONDA_100_2000	(Don’t worry about it. Just let me know if there’s\nsomething else I can do.)
A2_2580_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hmm... Actually, can I ask you some questions?
A2_2580_GORONDA_200_1000	(What do you want to know?)
A2_2580_SEL_0_1000	About you, Pangoro...
A2_2580_SEL_0_2000	Why were you brought here?
A2_2580_SEL_0_3000	Anything on your mind?
A2_2580_PIKACHU_300_1000	Tell me about yourself, Pangoro.
A2_2580_GORONDA_300_1000	(Well, just look at me. I’m good at jobs that require\nmuscle.)
A2_2580_PIKACHU_300_2000	That’s a big help—but if you have to throw me again,\nmaybe don’t use ALL that muscle next time.
A2_2580_PIKACHU_400_1000	So what are you in for, Pangoro?
A2_2580_GORONDA_400_1000	(I have no idea.)
A2_2580_GORONDA_400_2000	(I was just living my life, minding my own business,\nwhen suddenly the police surrounded me.)
A2_2580_GORONDA_400_3000	(Then, they put this cube thing on my back...)
A2_2580_GORONDA_400_4000	(And after that, it’s just like what happened to you.)
A2_2580_PIKACHU_400_2000	What kind of slipshod operation are they running?!\nI’m amazed you went so quietly.
A2_2580_GORONDA_400_5000	(To tell you the truth...I don’t remember that part.)
A2_2580_PIKACHU_400_3000	Nothing at all?
A2_2580_GORONDA_400_6000	(I guess you could say I just suddenly woke up here.)
A2_2580_GORONDA_400_7000	(It felt the same as when we go to the roof—if that\nmakes sense.)
A2_2580_PIKACHU_400_4000	Interesting. So it can happen outside the station too...
A2_2580_PIKACHU_500_1000	Is there anything about this place that’s worrying you?
A2_2580_GORONDA_500_1000	(This room is too small.)
A2_2580_PIKACHU_500_2000	Yeah, I imagine it would be for a big guy like you...
A2_2580_GORONDA_500_2000	(And I don’t like the voice we hear when it’s time to\ngo to the roof.)
A2_2580_GORONDA_500_3000	(Whenever we hear that voice, my head goes all fuzzy\nand I feel sick.)
A2_2580_PIKACHU_500_3000	Same... I also lost my memory of what happened right\nafter that announcement.
A2_2580_GORONDA_500_4000	(Covering my ears doesn’t help, either. I hate it.)
A2_2590_PIKACHU_100_1000	Luxray said there are two other detainment rooms.
A2_2590_PIKACHU_100_2000	I wonder what’s going on there... I oughta go through\nthe ducts and check.
A2_2596_PIKACHU_100_1000	Phew... That was close, but I managed to get out.
A2_2596_PIKACHU_100_2000	OK, I made it to another room—one that isn’t mine\nor Luxray’s.
A2_2596_PIKACHU_100_3000	I should go talk to the new Pokémon I heard were\nbrought here.
A2_2600_PIKACHU_100_1000	I came all this way—might as well talk to the Pokémon\nwhile I’m here.
A2_2620_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Morpeko. Can I talk to you for a second?
A2_2620_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_100_1000	(I got nothin’ to talk about! Got any food?)
A2_2620_PIKACHU_100_2000	The PPB’s been providing us with food.
A2_2620_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_100_2000	(Huh?! You think I got time to wait for those bozos?!)
A2_2620_PIKACHU_100_3000	Well, while we’re waiting, why don’t you chat with\nme? It’ll help kill time!
A2_2620_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_100_3000	(You’re annoyingly persistent, ya know that?)
A2_2620_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_200_1000	(What, you’re still not done?)
A2_2620_SEL_0_1000	About you, Morpeko...
A2_2620_SEL_0_2000	Why were you brought here?
A2_2620_SEL_0_3000	Anything on your mind?
A2_2620_PIKACHU_300_1000	Why don’t you tell me a little about yourself,\nMorpeko?
A2_2620_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_300_1000	(Well, I know this one move. It’s pretty sweet, if I do\nsay so myself!)
A2_2620_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_300_2000	(It goes back and forth between being an Electric-\ntype move and a Dark-type move!)
A2_2620_PIKACHU_300_2000	An Electric-type move, you say?
A2_2620_PIKACHU_300_3000	Just to be clear...you haven’t done anything to a\nSlowpoke statue, have you, Morpeko?
A2_2620_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_300_3000	(What the heck are ya talkin’ about?! Why would I\ndo somethin’ like that?!)
A2_2620_PIKACHU_300_4000	That’s what I thought. Never mind. Forget it.
A2_2620_PIKACHU_400_1000	So what are you in for, Morpeko?
A2_2620_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_400_1000	(I’m in here ’cause of some lousy, stinkin’, no-good\nhumans!)
A2_2620_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_400_2000	(They say I stole someone’s food! Why the heck\nwould I go an’ do a thing like that?!)
A2_2620_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_400_3000	(Grrr... Just thinkin’ about it makes me SO MAD!!!)
A2_2620_PIKACHU_400_2000	I understand how you feel, but please, try to calm\ndown! Making a scene in here won’t solve anything.
A2_2620_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_400_4000	(Stop tellin’ me what to do!)
A2_2620_PIKACHU_500_1000	Is there anything about this place that’s been eating\nat you?
A2_2620_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_500_1000	(Yeah, there’s nothin’ TO eat! How many times do I\ngotta tell you? Now gimme some food already!)
A2_2620_PIKACHU_500_2000	Sadly, I don’t have any food to share with you, buddy.
A2_2620_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_500_2000	(Grrr... So huuungryyyy...and so MAD!)
A2_2620_PIKACHU_500_3000	I’m sure they’ll bring you some food later. Just hang\nin there a bit longer.
A2_2640_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Inteleon. Can I talk to you for a bit?
A2_2640_INTEREON_100_1000	(And who are you supposed to be?)
A2_2640_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’m the great Detective Pikachu. I’m looking for info\nthat could help us get outta here.
A2_2640_INTEREON_100_2000	(Now I get it. You must have come from one of the\nother rooms.)
A2_2640_INTEREON_100_3000	(I only just arrived here today. What do you suppose\nI can do to help?)
A2_2640_PIKACHU_100_3000	I’m just trying to learn what I can. Even the smallest\ndetail could make a big difference.
A2_2640_INTEREON_100_4000	(All right. I’ll do what I can to assist you.)
A2_2640_PIKACHU_100_4000	Thanks. You’re a pal.
A2_2640_INTEREON_200_1000	(What would you like me to tell you?)
A2_2640_SEL_0_1000	About you, Inteleon...
A2_2640_SEL_0_2000	Why were you brought here?
A2_2640_SEL_0_3000	Anything on your mind?
A2_2640_PIKACHU_300_1000	So what’s your story, Inteleon?
A2_2640_INTEREON_300_1000	(I can shoot water from my finger. I water flowers to\nhelp them grow.)
A2_2640_PIKACHU_300_2000	That’s nice of you. Seems like that skill would come in\nhandy—and not just for gardening!
A2_2640_INTEREON_300_2000	(I suppose I could use Water Gun to play with other\nPokémon, but that’s not really my speed.)
A2_2640_INTEREON_300_3000	(I’d rather live a more peaceful, elegant life.)
A2_2640_PIKACHU_400_1000	So what are you in for, Inteleon?
A2_2640_INTEREON_400_1000	(Mistaken identity, I’m afraid. They seem to think I’m\nthe lowlife who went berserk at the flower shop.)
A2_2640_INTEREON_400_2000	(It’s rather upsetting. Gardening is my passion,\nafter all!)
A2_2640_PIKACHU_400_2000	So you didn’t do it?
A2_2640_INTEREON_400_3000	(Of course not. I’m the florist’s partner.)
A2_2640_INTEREON_400_4000	(I help her tend to the flowers every day. Why would\nI ruin them?)
A2_2640_PIKACHU_400_3000	Makes sense... I believe you, Inteleon.
A2_2640_INTEREON_400_5000	(Thank you. But I do wonder who the real culprit is.)
A2_2640_PIKACHU_500_1000	Is there anything else that’s been on your mind lately?
A2_2640_INTEREON_500_1000	(I know that my human partner must be so worried\nfor my sake.)
A2_2640_INTEREON_500_2000	(And I’m worried about the flowers and plants I left\nbehind. Do you think they’ll grow strong without me?)
A2_2640_PIKACHU_500_2000	I’m sure they’re OK. Plants can be surprisingly tough.
A2_2640_INTEREON_500_3000	(I certainly hope so... Yes, I have to believe that.)
A2_2645_PIKACHU_100_1000	Luxray said there were two other rooms, which leaves\none more to go.
A2_2645_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’ll try going there too.
A2_2650_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s see... How can I get up to the duct?
A2_2656_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, this is the last room.
A2_2656_PIKACHU_100_2000	It looked like I could get up to the next floor through\nthe duct, but who knows where I’d pop out.
A2_2656_PIKACHU_100_3000	I don’t wanna draw too much attention yet. Right now,\nI’m just gathering intel.
A2_2660_PIKACHU_100_1000	I came all this way—might as well talk to the Pokémon\nwhile I’m here.
A2_2680_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, a Dedenne! Mind if I ask you a couple questions?
A2_2680_DEDENNE_100_1000	(Ah! You’re Pikachu, aren’t you?)
A2_2680_PIKACHU_100_2000	Huh? Yeah, I’m Pikachu... What of it?
A2_2680_DEDENNE_100_2000	(It’s all your fault! I’m in here because of you!)
A2_2680_PIKACHU_100_3000	Whoa, wait a second! What’re you talking about?
A2_2680_DEDENNE_100_3000	(You broke the Slowpoke statue in Fountain Plaza,\ndidn’t you?)
A2_2680_DEDENNE_100_4000	(Thanks to you, all the humans are suspicious of me!)
A2_2680_PIKACHU_100_4000	You’ve gotta be kidding me... Are they just rounding\nup any Electric-type Pokémon they find?
A2_2680_PIKACHU_100_5000	Listen, Dedenne—I’m not the one who broke the\nSlowpoke statue.
A2_2680_DEDENNE_100_5000	(Huh?! Then why did they bring me in?)
A2_2680_PIKACHU_100_6000	I’m trying to figure that out. That’s why I wanna hear\nwhat you know.
A2_2680_DEDENNE_200_1000	(Why is this happening to me? I can’t believe this...)
A2_2680_SEL_0_1000	About you, Dedenne...
A2_2680_SEL_0_2000	Why were you brought here?
A2_2680_SEL_0_3000	Anything on your mind?
A2_2680_PIKACHU_300_1000	You can use Electric-type moves, right, Dedenne?
A2_2680_DEDENNE_300_1000	(So? What about it?)
A2_2680_PIKACHU_300_2000	You SURE you didn’t damage that Slowpoke statue...?\nNah, ’course you didn’t.
A2_2680_DEDENNE_300_2000	(Why in the world would I wreck some statue? What\npossible good could that do me?!)
A2_2680_PIKACHU_300_3000	Point taken... Sorry for doubting you.
A2_2680_PIKACHU_400_1000	So, you said it’s my fault that you were brought here,\nDedenne...
A2_2680_DEDENNE_400_1000	(They must think that I’m in cahoots with you or\nsomething—but I don’t even know you!)
A2_2680_PIKACHU_400_2000	C’mon, cut me some slack already! Seriously, what’s\nthe PPB even thinking?
A2_2680_PIKACHU_400_3000	If they really think I’m the culprit, then detaining me\nshould’ve been the end of it...
A2_2680_PIKACHU_500_1000	Has anything been worrying you since you got here?
A2_2680_DEDENNE_500_1000	(Are you seriously asking me that? The only thing I\ncare about is when I’m getting out of here!)
A2_2680_DEDENNE_500_2000	(I need to get back home! I’ve got a human partner\nwho’s probably worried sick about me!)
A2_2680_PIKACHU_500_2000	Yeah, I get that. I don’t want Tim to worry, either.
A2_2700_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Greedent, can I ask you some questions?
A2_2700_YOKUBARISU_100_1000	(Sure, that’s fine...but who are you?)
A2_2700_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’m the great Detective Pikachu. Don’t worry—I’m on\nyour side.
A2_2700_YOKUBARISU_100_2000	(Wow, a great detective? That’s so cool!)
A2_2700_YOKUBARISU_100_3000	(So what did you wanna ask me?)
A2_2700_YOKUBARISU_200_1000	(What did you wanna ask me?)
A2_2700_SEL_0_1000	About you, Greedent...
A2_2700_SEL_0_2000	Why were you brought here?
A2_2700_SEL_0_3000	Anything on your mind?
A2_2700_PIKACHU_300_1000	What can you tell me about yourself, Greedent?
A2_2700_YOKUBARISU_300_1000	(My teeth are stronger than other Pokémon’s.)
A2_2700_YOKUBARISU_300_2000	(I can bite through and chow down on any Berry!)
A2_2700_PIKACHU_300_2000	Mind using those nice, hard chompers of yours to\nchew a hole in the wall and get us outta this room?
A2_2700_YOKUBARISU_300_3000	(...Is that a serious question?)
A2_2700_PIKACHU_300_3000	Heh. Guess I bit off more than I could chew with\nthat question.
A2_2700_PIKACHU_400_1000	So tell me, Greedent—what are you in for?
A2_2700_YOKUBARISU_400_1000	(Who knows...because I sure don’t!)
A2_2700_YOKUBARISU_400_2000	(I was just eating Berries today like I do every day.)
A2_2700_PIKACHU_400_2000	You didn’t steal those Berries from anyone, did ya?
A2_2700_YOKUBARISU_400_3000	(I could never do a thing like that! Stealing stuff is\nbound to get you into a fight, you know!)
A2_2700_YOKUBARISU_400_4000	(No matter how badly I want a Berry, I’d never get in\na fight over one—that sounds painful!)
A2_2700_PIKACHU_400_3000	I feel ya.
A2_2700_PIKACHU_400_4000	But in that case, why DID the PPB detain you...?
A2_2700_PIKACHU_500_1000	Is anything bothering you, Greedent?
A2_2700_YOKUBARISU_500_1000	(Just that there aren’t any Berries here. You don’t\nhappen to have any, do you?)
A2_2700_PIKACHU_500_2000	’Fraid not.
A2_2700_YOKUBARISU_500_2000	(Awww... If you find any, could you please give them\nto me?)
A2_2700_PIKACHU_500_3000	Sure, I guess. But I doubt I’ll find any Berries just lying\naround the police station.
A2_2710_YOKUBARISU_100_1000	(Now that I think of it, I haven’t seen Berries in this\nbuilding, but I did see some trash.)
A2_2710_PIKACHU_100_1000	What sort of trash?
A2_2710_YOKUBARISU_100_2000	(Wanna see for yourself?)
A2_2710_PIKACHU_100_2000	This is a note written by a human. It says “2168.”
A2_2710_YOKUBARISU_100_3000	(It doesn’t mean anything to me.)
A2_2710_PIKACHU_100_3000	Mind if I take this note?
A2_2710_YOKUBARISU_100_4000	(Well, OK. But only because I can’t eat it.)
A2_2710_PIKACHU_100_4000	Thanks, Greedent.
A2_2720_PIKACHU_100_1000	So you were brought here too, eh, Watchog?
A2_2720_MIRUHOG_100_1000	(What are you doing here, Pikachu?)
A2_2720_PIKACHU_100_2000	The same as you, I’d imagine.
A2_2720_MIRUHOG_100_2000	(Huh? What? What do you mean?!)
A2_2720_PIKACHU_100_3000	Just calm down for a second. I wanna ask you some\nquestions, Watchog.
A2_2720_MIRUHOG_200_1000	(What do you want to ask me?)
A2_2720_SEL_0_1000	About you, Watchog...
A2_2720_SEL_0_2000	Why were you brought here?
A2_2720_SEL_0_3000	Anything on your mind?
A2_2720_PIKACHU_300_1000	Can you tell me more about yourself, Watchog?
A2_2720_MIRUHOG_300_1000	(I can make my eyes glow!)
A2_2720_PIKACHU_300_2000	That’s brilliant! I bet that makes it a walk in the park\nto see where you’re going at night.
A2_2720_MIRUHOG_300_2000	(But you’d better not look at me then. I glow so\nbright it can be blinding!)
A2_2720_PIKACHU_400_1000	How’d you end up in here, Watchog?
A2_2720_PIKACHU_400_2000	No, wait—I’m pretty sure I can guess the answer\nby now...
A2_2720_MIRUHOG_400_1000	(Wh-what do you mean?)
A2_2720_PIKACHU_400_3000	You were snatched up by some humans over\nsomething you’re pretty sure you didn’t do, right?
A2_2720_MIRUHOG_400_2000	(Yes, exactly! Wow... Good guess, Pikachu.)
A2_2720_PIKACHU_400_4000	That’s what everyone here’s been saying.
A2_2720_PIKACHU_400_5000	I arrived here last night. What about you, Watchog?
A2_2720_MIRUHOG_400_3000	(Today—so not that long ago, actually—I was startled\nby a group of humans suddenly surrounding me!)
A2_2720_MIRUHOG_400_4000	(At first I thought I was just a really popular Pokémon,\nbut I guess not!)
A2_2720_PIKACHU_400_6000	It must’ve been alarming, having people get the jump\non you like that.
A2_2720_PIKACHU_500_1000	Anything bothering you right now, Watchog?
A2_2720_MIRUHOG_500_1000	(I was protecting the city the best way I know how.)
A2_2720_MIRUHOG_500_2000	(So I hope everything’s fine out there without me...\nThat’s what’s bothering me.)
A2_2720_PIKACHU_500_2000	With all these Pokémon getting detained, it seems\nlike things out there are anything BUT fine.
A2_2720_PIKACHU_500_3000	But I dunno if there’s much you could do to stop it,\neven if you were out keeping watch...
A2_2720_MIRUHOG_500_3000	(Oh... I hate feeling so powerless!)
A2_2730_PIKACHU_100_1000	All the Pokémon here say they were brought in for\nthings they didn’t do.
A2_2730_PIKACHU_100_2000	That’s a few too many innocent Pokémon being\ndetained to chalk it all up to coincidence.
A2_2730_PIKACHU_100_3000	Doesn’t anyone else think this is strange?
A2_2730_PIKACHU_100_4000	I’d better broaden the scope of my investigation a bit.
A2_2730_PIKACHU_100_5000	I’ll go talk to Luxray again.
A2_2740_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, how to get up there...
A2_2750_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Ah, Pikachu. You’re back.)
A2_2750_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. I went and checked out those other rooms.
A2_2750_PIKACHU_100_2000	More and more Pokémon keep getting brought in\nhere, and none of ’em have done anything wrong.
A2_2750_RENTORAR_100_2000	(Just like those of us in here.)
A2_2750_PIKACHU_100_3000	So it’s the same story with you guys, huh?
A2_2750_RENTORAR_100_3000	(You should talk to the others yourself if you want\nmore details.)
A2_2750_PIKACHU_100_4000	Will do.
A2_2750_PIKACHU_100_5000	But also, there’s something I wanted to talk to you\nabout. I wanna get out of the detainment rooms and\ninvestigate the rest of the station.
A2_2750_PIKACHU_100_6000	Do you know how I could do that without being\nnoticed?
A2_2750_RENTORAR_100_4000	(No humans will find us if I use my special vision to\navoid them.)
A2_2750_PIKACHU_100_7000	Now that’d be out of sight! But how can you and me\nget outta here?
A2_2750_RENTORAR_100_5000	(That’s simple enough. We just need to open\nthe door.)
A2_2750_PIKACHU_100_8000	Whaaa—?! What are you talkin’ about?
A2_2750_RENTORAR_100_6000	(There’s a room nearby where many humans gather.\nIn that room is a machine.)
A2_2750_RENTORAR_100_7000	(The humans appear to lock and unlock rooms by\noperating the machine.)
A2_2750_PIKACHU_100_9000	Must be a guardroom.
A2_2750_PIKACHU_100_10000	So they’re managing these doors with machines\ninstead of keys. I’m surprised you knew all that.
A2_2750_RENTORAR_100_8000	(I observed the humans through the walls as they\noperated the machine.)
A2_2750_RENTORAR_100_9000	(But I don’t understand how it works, and I can’t\nleave this room.)
A2_2750_PIKACHU_100_11000	That’s where I come in, eh?
A2_2750_PIKACHU_100_12000	Do you know anything else—like what sort of controls\nthey used?
A2_2750_RENTORAR_100_10000	(They appeared to be pressing down on some...\nsmall protrusions.)
A2_2750_PIKACHU_100_13000	Maybe it needs a passcode or something? Oh yeah,\nthere was that note from earlier...
A2_2750_RENTORAR_100_11000	(Can you get there from that duct in the wall?)
A2_2750_PIKACHU_100_14000	Won’t know till I try!
A2_2750_RENTORAR_100_12000	(There are currently no humans in that room, but\ndon’t let your guard down.)
A2_2760_RENTORAR_100_1000	(What is it? Weren’t you going to investigate\nthat machine?)
A2_2760_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. There’s a number on this note: 2168. I think it’s\nthe passcode.
A2_2760_PIKACHU_100_2000	But first I wanna ask you a couple things, Luxray.
A2_2760_RENTORAR_200_1000	(Remember that number of yours and get to the\nhumans’ room.)
A2_2760_PIKACHU_200_1000	2168, right? Don’t worry—my mind’s like a steel trap!
A2_2760_SEL_0_1000	About you, Luxray...
A2_2760_SEL_0_2000	Why were you brought here?
A2_2760_SEL_0_3000	Anything on your mind?
A2_2760_PIKACHU_300_1000	You’re a Pokémon of many talents, Luxray.
A2_2760_PIKACHU_300_2000	Not only do your Electric-type moves pack a punch,\nbut you can even see through walls and things...
A2_2760_PIKACHU_300_3000	I gotta say, I’m pretty jealous!
A2_2760_RENTORAR_300_1000	(Both of those are as natural as breathing to me.)
A2_2760_RENTORAR_300_2000	(You can generate electricity too, can’t you, Pikachu?\nMine is no different.)
A2_2760_PIKACHU_300_4000	Uh, yeah...
A2_2760_RENTORAR_300_3000	(What is it? Why are you making that face?)
A2_2760_PIKACHU_400_1000	So, Luxray, is it safe to assume you have no idea why\nyou were captured?
A2_2760_RENTORAR_400_1000	(No... I do have an idea.)
A2_2760_PIKACHU_400_2000	Is it something you did?
A2_2760_RENTORAR_400_2000	(I don’t feel like getting into that right now.)
A2_2760_PIKACHU_400_3000	Hey, c’mon! Now you’ve got me curious!
A2_2760_RENTORAR_400_3000	(Stop questioning me and go investigate that machine\nwhile the humans are still away.)
A2_2760_PIKACHU_500_1000	Is there something that’s been on your mind, Luxray?
A2_2760_RENTORAR_500_1000	(I’m certainly beginning to wonder if you’ll ever go\nand open that door.)
A2_2760_PIKACHU_500_2000	All in good time! Anything else bothering ya?
A2_2760_RENTORAR_500_2000	(I won’t say there isn’t...but it’s nothing I need to talk\nto you about.)
A2_2760_PIKACHU_500_3000	*sigh* And here I thought we were working together.\nWhy won’t you open up a little?
A2_2760_RENTORAR_500_3000	(We are working together—and that’s ALL we’re\ndoing.)
A2_2770_BEROBA_100_1000	(You must be pretty amazing to get into Luxray’s\ngood graces even though you’re so weak!)
A2_2770_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m not sure if that’s a compliment or an insult.
A2_2770_BEROBA_100_2000	(It’s a compliment, of course! By the way, when can\nwe get out of here?)
A2_2770_PIKACHU_100_2000	Whoa there, Impidimp—slow your roll. I’m still just\nexploring the building.
A2_2770_BEROBA_100_3000	(Oh, OK! I’m looking forward to leaving this\nplace, though!)
A2_2770_BEROBA_200_1000	(You still need something?)
A2_2770_SEL_0_1000	About you, Impidimp...
A2_2770_SEL_0_2000	Why were you brought here?
A2_2770_SEL_0_3000	Anything on your mind?
A2_2770_PIKACHU_300_1000	Can you tell me a little about yourself, Impidimp?
A2_2770_BEROBA_300_1000	(I’m good at playing pranks! Startling people is so\nmuch fun!)
A2_2770_PIKACHU_300_2000	What sort of pranks?
A2_2770_BEROBA_300_2000	(So, like, after dinner’s over, I like to prank my partner\nreal good by carrying his dirty dishes to the kitchen!)
A2_2770_PIKACHU_300_3000	Is...is that a prank? That’s not a prank...
A2_2770_PIKACHU_400_1000	How’d you wind up in here, Impidimp—and why?
A2_2770_BEROBA_400_1000	(I used to live with my human partner.)
A2_2770_BEROBA_400_2000	(But one day, a police officer showed up while I was\nplaying by myself and took me here.)
A2_2770_PIKACHU_400_2000	Had you done anything bad?
A2_2770_BEROBA_400_3000	(Hmm... I mean, I like pranks and all, but I don’t think\nI did anything worth locking me up like this.)
A2_2770_BEROBA_400_4000	(Ahhh, I just wanna get out of here soon so I can see\nmy partner!)
A2_2770_PIKACHU_500_1000	Anything worrying you, Impidimp?
A2_2770_BEROBA_500_1000	(I guess just thinking about my partner...)
A2_2770_BEROBA_500_2000	(He’s a happy-go-lucky kinda guy who really enjoys\nmy pranks.)
A2_2770_BEROBA_500_3000	(I just hope he hasn’t forgotten about me. I’d be so\nlonely without him...)
A2_2770_PIKACHU_500_2000	Don’t worry. No one could ever forget a guy like you.
A2_2780_LEPARDAS_100_1000	(You look so cute—but you must be smart, too, for\nLuxray to invite you into his inner circle like he did.)
A2_2780_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks aren’t everything. What matters are feelings!
A2_2780_LEPARDAS_100_2000	(My goodness, such stirring words! You’re just full of\nsurprises, aren’t you.)
A2_2780_LEPARDAS_200_1000	(May I help you?)
A2_2780_SEL_0_1000	About you, Liepard...
A2_2780_SEL_0_2000	Why were you brought here?
A2_2780_SEL_0_3000	Anything on your mind?
A2_2780_PIKACHU_300_1000	Tell me about yourself, Liepard.
A2_2780_LEPARDAS_300_1000	(Let’s see. Well, I can move around very discreetly.\nThat’s about it, in terms of special skills.)
A2_2780_PIKACHU_300_2000	If you can do that, can’t you escape this\npolice station?
A2_2780_LEPARDAS_300_2000	(That would be difficult. The police may not notice\nme, but I can’t deceive a machine.)
A2_2780_PIKACHU_400_1000	Why were you brought here, Liepard?
A2_2780_LEPARDAS_400_1000	(I was spending time with my friends Luxray\nand Sableye.)
A2_2780_LEPARDAS_400_2000	(The three of us were brought here at the same time\na while ago.)
A2_2780_PIKACHU_400_2000	They rounded up the whole group of you, did they?
A2_2780_LEPARDAS_400_3000	(Not quite.)
A2_2780_LEPARDAS_400_4000	(Our friend Mightyena was also with us that day.\nHe’s the only one who managed to avoid capture.)
A2_2780_PIKACHU_400_3000	Why only Mightyena?
A2_2780_LEPARDAS_400_5000	(I don’t know.)
A2_2780_LEPARDAS_400_6000	(Luxray knows more details, but he won’t tell me.)
A2_2780_PIKACHU_500_1000	Has anything been worrying you, Liepard?
A2_2780_LEPARDAS_500_1000	(Yes, I’m worried about Luxray. He seems so down,\nas if something is weighing heavily on his mind.)
A2_2780_PIKACHU_500_2000	Any idea what that could be?
A2_2780_LEPARDAS_500_2000	(You’ll have to ask him, I’m afraid. Perhaps he’d be\nwilling to open up to you.)
A2_2790_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s see... Which room should I go to?
A2_2790_SEL_0_1000	Luxray’s room
A2_2790_SEL_0_2000	Watchog’s room
A2_2790_SEL_0_3000	Inteleon’s room
A2_2790_SEL_0_4000	The guardroom
A2_2790_SEL_0_5000	1F
A2_2800_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s see... Which room should I go to?
A2_2800_SEL_0_1000	My own room
A2_2800_SEL_0_2000	Watchog’s room
A2_2800_SEL_0_3000	Inteleon’s room
A2_2800_SEL_0_4000	The guardroom
A2_2800_SEL_0_5000	1F
A2_2810_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s see... Which room should I go to?
A2_2810_SEL_0_1000	My own room
A2_2810_SEL_0_2000	Luxray’s room
A2_2810_SEL_0_3000	Inteleon’s room
A2_2810_SEL_0_4000	The guardroom
A2_2810_SEL_0_5000	1F
A2_2820_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s see... Which room should I go to?
A2_2820_SEL_0_1000	My own room
A2_2820_SEL_0_2000	Luxray’s room
A2_2820_SEL_0_3000	Watchog’s room
A2_2820_SEL_0_4000	The guardroom
A2_2820_SEL_0_5000	1F
A2_2826_PIKACHU_100_1000	This should be the room Luxray was talking about.\nThey must control the detainment rooms from here.
A2_2826_PIKACHU_100_2000	So where’s the machine he mentioned?
A2_2835_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like a floor plan of the police station.
A2_2835_PIKACHU_100_2000	It seems to be made for the public, but that’s OK.\nThis’ll make it easier to explore the station.
A2_2835_PIKACHU_100_3000	Let’s see... I’m in the basement level of the building.\nThere are two stories up above, and that’s where the\nhumans’ offices are located.
A2_2835_PIKACHU_100_4000	I think I’ll borrow this map for a while.
A2_2835_PIKACHU_200_1000	Guess the map was the only really useful thing here.
A2_2840_PIKACHU_100_1000	This oughta be the machine that can unlock all the\ndoors to our rooms.
A2_2840_PIKACHU_100_2000	Just like I thought—it’s set up to open the doors when\na numeric passcode is entered.
A2_2840_PIKACHU_100_3000	I’ll try the number from the note Greedent gave me...
A2_2860_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yes! Worked like a charm! That should’ve opened\nthe doors.
A2_2860_PIKACHU_400_1000	Long as I’m here, I oughta look around and see what\ninfo I can dig up about this building.
A2_2865_PIKACHU_100_1000	Now to hightail it back to the detainment rooms\nbefore any cops show up.
A2_2870_PIKACHU_100_1000	Guess what—I unlocked the doors! Now we can\nexplore the rest of the police station!
A2_2870_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Well done. I was right to join forces with you.)
A2_2870_PIKACHU_100_2000	Finally giving me my due credit, eh?
A2_2870_PIKACHU_100_3000	Then let’s get investigating!
A2_2870_RENTORAR_100_2000	(Yes, let’s. You can ride on my back.)
A2_2890_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Where shall we inspect first? I’d like to hear what\nyour plan is.)
A2_2890_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, if we’re lookin’ at a station investigation...
A2_2890_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s start with the first floor. According to the floor\nplan, we can find a reference room there.
A2_2890_RENTORAR_100_2000	(The first floor? Very well.)
A2_2890_PIKACHU_100_3000	All right, Luxray! Let’s go!
A2_2900_PIKACHU_100_1000	Phew! At least we made it back safely.
A2_2900_BEROBA_100_1000	(Yeah! How’d it go? Can we get outta here soon?)
A2_2900_RENTORAR_100_1000	(No, this will still take some time. Isn’t that right,\nPikachu?)
A2_2900_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah. But we’ll get you all outta here—trust me. Just\nhang in there a little longer.
A2_2900_PIKACHU_100_3000	We still need proof that we’re innocent, but I think we\nneed to leave that to Tim.
A2_2900_LEPARDAS_100_1000	(Who is Tim? A human?)
A2_2900_PIKACHU_100_4000	Yeah, he’s my partner.
A2_2900_PIKACHU_100_5000	And a detective, too—well, a rookie detective...
A2_2900_RENTORAR_100_2000	(He’s a detective?)
A2_2900_PIKACHU_100_5333	Yeah, and you might not believe this...
A2_2900_PIKACHU_100_5666	but he and I can actually talk to and understand\neach other.
A2_2900_BEROBA_100_2000	(Awww, stop lyin’! There’s no way that’s true!)
A2_2900_RENTORAR_100_2500	(Pikachu... Can you get in touch with this human?)
A2_2900_PIKACHU_100_6000	Well, he visited me yesterday, and I’m sure he’ll be\nback again today.
A2_2900_RENTORAR_100_3000	(Then I have a favor to ask.)
A2_2900_RENTORAR_100_4000	(Will you ask him to check up on the Mightyena in\nthe city and report on how he’s doing?)
A2_2900_PIKACHU_100_7000	Sure, I can do that, but...why are you interested in\nsome Mightyena?
A2_2900_RENTORAR_100_5000	(... ... ...)
A2_2900_LEPARDAS_100_2000	(Luxray had a fight with Mightyena right before he\nwas thrown in here.)
A2_2900_LEPARDAS_100_3000	(During their squabble, Mightyena was injured, and\nLuxray’s been worried about him.)
A2_2900_PIKACHU_100_8000	Wow, I didn’t realize you cared so much about your\nfriends!
A2_2900_RENTORAR_100_6000	(Keep your thoughts to yourself.)
A2_2900_PIKACHU_100_9000	Easy, easy. I’ll be sure to pass your message on to\nTim during our next visit.
A2_2900_RENTORAR_100_7000	(...Thanks.)
A2_2900_LEPARDAS_100_4000	(Thanks from me as well, Pikachu.)
A2_2900_LEPARDAS_100_5000	(Mightyena should be near 2nd Avenue.)
A2_2900_PIKACHU_100_10000	Got it. I’ll pass that on to Tim too.
A2_2900_PIKACHU_100_11000	I wonder what Tim’s up to now...
A2_30001_PKBOY01_100_1000	Who could’ve broken\nthe Slowpoke statue...?
A2_30002_PCBOY02_100_1000	Maybe a Pokémon really\ndid destroy the statue...
A2_30020_YOKUBARISU_100_1000	Greee!
A2_30030_YOKUBARISU_100_1000	Greee!
A2_30040_BULU_100_1000	Snubbull!\nSnubbull!
A2_30060_TSUTARJA_100_1000	Sniii...
A2_30070_MAHOMIL_100_1000	Miiil?
A2_30080_MAHOMIL_100_1000	Miiil?
A2_30090_PHMANOLD01_100_1000	Time to wake up, Snivy!
A2_3010_TIM_100_1000	There might be another Pikachu somewhere in\nRyme City.
A2_3010_TIM_100_2000	And if that’s true, it must be the one that damaged\nthe Slowpoke statue...
A2_3010_TIM_100_3000	I need to hurry and find it so I can uncover the truth!
A2_30100_NYOROTONO_100_1000	Poli! ♪\nToed! ♪
A2_30110_IWANKO_100_1000	Ruff!
A2_30113_TAIRETSU_100_1000	Links!
A2_30115_NYABBY_100_1000	Lit...
A2_30117_NYARMAR_100_1000	...Eow.
A2_30119_ONISUZUME_100_1000	Speeea!
A2_30120_BAKECCHA_100_1000	Boo...
A2_30140_NYARMAR_100_1000	Meow!
A2_3030_TIM_100_1000	Oh... Were you worried about us, Rachel?
A2_3030_RACHEL_100_1000	Of course I was! And how’s Pikachu?
A2_3030_TIM_100_2000	The PPB is detaining him. They said he’s the lead\nsuspect in a property damage incident.
A2_3030_RACHEL_100_2000	You’re kidding, right? They must be mistaken...
A2_3030_TIM_100_3000	Only about the perpetrator.
A2_3030_TIM_100_3250	The PPB claim to have photographic evidence of\nthe crime...
A2_3030_TIM_100_3500	But I know it wasn’t my partner Pikachu. So I thought\nmaybe there’s another Pikachu in the city...
A2_3030_TIM_100_3750	and THAT’S the one they should be after!
A2_3030_RACHEL_100_3000	That makes sense. I can’t imagine your Pikachu doing\nanything bad like that.
A2_3030_RACHEL_100_4000	And on that note...where should we investigate first?!
A2_3030_TIM_100_4000	Huh? You’re coming with me? I mean, I’d appreciate\nthe help, but...
A2_3030_RACHEL_100_5000	Oh, don’t be so shy—if a friend’s in trouble, I want to\ndo whatever I can to help.
A2_3030_RACHEL_100_6000	And since you and Pikachu are my friends, it’s only\nnatural that I help, yeah?
A2_3030_TIM_100_5000	...Thanks, Rachel. It really makes me feel better to\nhear that.
A2_3030_TIM_100_6000	Well, uh, let’s start at Fountain Plaza, where the\nincident took place.
A2_3035_RACHEL_100_1000	Hm? Looks like Pablo’s busy with a customer.
A2_3035_TIM_100_1000	I guess we can’t talk to him right now. Let’s come\nback again later.
A2_3040_PAPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	Good morning.
A2_3040_PAPOLICEMAN01_100_2000	We’ve seen a huge rise in Pokémon-related incidents\nrecently. Please be careful.
A2_3040_TIM_100_1000	Yeah...sure.
A2_3050_PAPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	Incidents have been on the rise lately. Take care of\nyourself out there.
A2_3060_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	Allow me to explain our visitation rules.
A2_3060_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_2000	Visits are allowed in the afternoons.
A2_3060_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_3000	You can visit your partner a maximum of twice per\nday, but they cannot be consecutive visits.
A2_3060_TIM_100_1000	So, that’s a no for now?
A2_3060_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_4000	Correct. You’re not permitted to visit your partner at\nthis time. Please come back later.
A2_3060_TIM_100_2000	OK...
A2_3060_RACHEL_100_1000	We can investigate around the city while we wait.
A2_3070_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	We don’t allow visitations at this hour. Please come\nback later.
A2_3080_LIVOLT02_100_1000	Manec!
A2_3080_RACHEL_100_1000	Well, aren’t you a lively Manectric!
A2_3080_TIM_100_1000	Wow, Rachel. You’re not even nervous around\npolice Pokémon?
A2_3080_LIVOLT02_200_1000	Manec!
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_100_1000	*sniffle* How could this happen?
A2_3090_TIM_100_1000	Are you OK?
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_100_2000	Oh, sorry. I’m just so stressed out I started muttering\nto myself...
A2_3090_TIM_100_2000	Well, we’re actually investigating the recent Pokémon\nincidents.
A2_3090_RACHEL_100_1000	If there’s anything we can do to help, we’d love to try!
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_100_3000	Oh, that’s too kind... Thank you.
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_200_1000	*sigh* How could this happen?
A2_3090_SEL_0_1000	What’s stressing you out?
A2_3090_SEL_0_2000	About Pikachu...
A2_3090_SEL_0_3000	About the detained Pokémon...
A2_3090_SEL_0_4000	A Pokémon that can look like others...
A2_3090_TIM_300_1000	So what exactly happened?
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_300_1000	When I got to my shop this morning, I saw that\nsomeone had messed up my flowers!
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_300_2000	So the Pokémon Protection Bureau came and\ninvestigated...
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_300_3000	*sniff* But...how could they accuse my Inteleon...?
A2_3090_TIM_300_2000	Wait, did they take your Inteleon away?
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_300_4000	Yes. But there’s no way he’d ever do such a thing!
A2_3090_TIM_400_1000	Did you happen to see a Pikachu two nights ago—the\nevening the Slowpoke statue in Fountain Plaza was\ndamaged?
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_400_1000	I’m sorry... I don’t really remember.
A2_3090_TIM_400_2000	OK...
A2_3090_TIM_500_1000	Could you tell us a bit more about your Inteleon?
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_500_1000	Inteleon is my partner. He’s been with me forever,\nsince we were both small.
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_500_2000	He loves flowers, and he always waters them so\ngently for me.
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_500_3000	I can’t even imagine such a sweet Pokémon doing\nanything bad...
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_500_4000	But for some reason, <color=#F39800FF>the PPB is convinced that\nInteleon ruined the flowers</color>!
A2_3090_TIM_500_2000	Wow, that’s awful. Did anyone actually see Inteleon\nmessing with the flowers?
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_500_5000	No, not a single eyewitness.
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_500_6000	But the PPB claims to have proof from some\nsurveillance camera footage...
A2_3090_TIM_500_3000	Do you mind if we investigate the scene? We might\nlearn something.
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_500_7000	Of course I don’t mind... It happened right in my\nshop’s flower display.
A2_3090_TIM_600_1000	Can you think of any Pokémon able to make itself\nlook like a different one?
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_600_1000	I know some Pokémon that look like flowers or trees\nor what-have-you. Is that what you mean?
A2_3090_TIM_600_2000	No, I mean the Pokémon responsible for this may\nhave passed itself off as Inteleon.
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_600_2000	Oh, dear...
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_600_3000	I have heard that somewhere in the city is a Pokémon\nthat knows the move Transform.
A2_3090_PHWOMAN01_600_4000	But I don’t know any more details than that...
A2_3090_TIM_600_3000	Just that detail is very helpful. Thank you.
A2_3090_RACHEL_600_1000	Whatever this Pokémon is, it’s somewhere in this city.\nLet’s try to find it, Tim!
A2_3100_PKMAN01_100_1000	*sigh* I can’t believe this is happening...
A2_3100_TIM_100_1000	Is something wrong?
A2_3100_PKMAN01_100_2000	Have...have you ever had your dearest friend taken\naway from you?
A2_3100_TIM_100_2000	That sounds heartbreaking...
A2_3100_PKMAN01_100_3000	I know, right? And that’s exactly what happened to\nme today!
A2_3100_RACHEL_100_1000	That’s terrible... Do you want to talk about it?
A2_3100_PKMAN01_100_4000	Yeah, thanks. I think talking through it might help me\nfeel a little better.
A2_3100_PKMAN01_200_1000	I’m so lonely without Morpeko...
A2_3100_SEL_0_1000	About the sad experience...
A2_3100_SEL_0_2000	About Pikachu...
A2_3100_SEL_0_3000	About the detained Pokémon...
A2_3100_SEL_0_4000	A Pokémon that can look like others...
A2_3100_TIM_300_1000	So tell me, what happened?
A2_3100_PKMAN01_300_1000	Some people from the PPB just suddenly showed\nup today.
A2_3100_PKMAN01_300_2000	They rattled off a whole lot of accusations and then\ntold me they were taking away my Morpeko.
A2_3100_PKMAN01_300_3000	I tried to stop them, but they said they had proof\nand the law is the law.
A2_3100_PKMAN01_300_4000	Morpeko looked so sad and defeated as the police\ntook him away.
A2_3100_RACHEL_300_1000	How awful...
A2_3100_PKMAN01_300_5000	Yeah, it really was...
A2_3100_TIM_400_1000	Did you happen to see a Pikachu two nights ago—the\nevening the Slowpoke statue in Fountain Plaza was\ndamaged?
A2_3100_PKMAN01_400_1000	No, I didn’t. I was at home that night.
A2_3100_TIM_400_2000	I see...
A2_3100_TIM_500_1000	Could you tell us a bit more about your Morpeko?
A2_3100_PKMAN01_500_1000	Morpeko’s my partner. He’s just a cheerful little guy\nwith a big appetite.
A2_3100_PKMAN01_500_2000	I assume that’s why the PPB suspected him.
A2_3100_TIM_500_2000	What do you mean?
A2_3100_PKMAN01_500_3000	Apparently a Pokémon was causing trouble last night.
A2_3100_PKMAN01_500_4000	They said <color=#F39800FF>a Pokémon stole someone’s food</color> right in\nfront of this very café.
A2_3100_PKMAN01_500_5000	Morpeko had nothing to do with it, but the PPB\nwouldn’t listen...
A2_3100_RACHEL_500_1000	So that’s what happened...
A2_3100_PKMAN01_500_6000	When Morpeko’s hungry, he does get cranky, and his\nfur even changes color.
A2_3100_PKMAN01_500_7000	But he’s never stolen food before! Not even once!
A2_3100_PKMAN01_500_8000	I can’t even imagine that little guy causing trouble\nfor anyone...
A2_3100_TIM_500_3000	You don’t say... I’ll try looking around the scene here.
A2_3100_TIM_600_1000	Can you think of any Pokémon able to make itself\nlook like a different one?
A2_3100_PKMAN01_600_1000	Huh? I don’t understand the question.
A2_3100_TIM_600_2000	We think a different Pokémon may have passed itself\noff as Morpeko.
A2_3100_PKMAN01_600_2000	Ohhh! If that’s true, that’d mean Morpeko is innocent!
A2_3100_PKMAN01_600_3000	But, well...I can’t think of any Pokémon like that.
A2_3100_PKMAN01_600_4000	Could you keep asking around? Maybe someone else\nwill know!
A2_3110_PABLO_100_1000	If all this investigating has got you running on empty,\na coffee break might put some fuel back in your tank.
A2_3110_TIM_100_1000	Thanks, Pablo, but I’m gonna keep at it a bit longer!
A2_3110_PABLO_100_2000	OK. But don’t overwork yourself, got it?
A2_3110_PABLO_200_1000	I hope Pikachu can come back soon.
A2_3110_SEL_0_1000	About another Pikachu...
A2_3110_SEL_0_2000	About the scorches on the café...
A2_3110_SEL_0_3000	A Pokémon that can look like others...
A2_3110_PABLO_300_1000	How’s the investigation going?
A2_3110_TIM_300_1000	It seems my partner may not be the only Pikachu in\nthe city.
A2_3110_PABLO_300_2000	Really? That’d be a surprise.
A2_3110_PABLO_300_3000	As I said yesterday, your little detective is the only\nPikachu I know.
A2_3110_PABLO_300_4000	He’s the only Pikachu who’d come here for a coffee,\nat any rate!
A2_3110_TIM_300_2000	Yeah, that’s true...
A2_3110_RACHEL_300_1000	I guess we’ve just got to keep looking, Tim.
A2_3110_TIM_400_1000	Did you know there’s a scorch mark on the wall\noutside your café?
A2_3110_PABLO_400_1000	Yeah, I’m just glad no one was hurt—and I’m pretty\nsure the damage was mostly superficial.
A2_3110_RACHEL_400_1000	That’s a relief. The scorch mark looked like it was\ncaused by a pretty powerful attack.
A2_3110_TIM_400_2000	Did you see it happen, Pablo?
A2_3110_PABLO_400_2000	No. By the time I noticed, it was already like that.\nNot a fun surprise, lemme tell you!
A2_3110_TIM_500_1000	Can you think of any Pokémon able to make itself\nlook like a different one, Pablo?
A2_3110_PABLO_500_1000	Hmm. Well, I’ve never met it myself, but I’ve heard\nthere’s a Ditto somewhere in the city.
A2_3110_TIM_500_2000	A Ditto?!
A2_3110_RACHEL_500_1000	Ditto can use Transform, so it would be able to pose\nas other Pokémon.
A2_3110_TIM_500_3000	Do you know where we could find that Ditto?
A2_3110_PABLO_500_2000	Unfortunately not...
A2_3110_TIM_500_4000	I see... Hmm...
A2_3110_RACHEL_500_2000	Let’s keep asking around the city.
A2_3110_PABLO_500_3000	Good luck to both of you!
A2_3120_RUNPAPPA_100_1000	Ludi!
A2_3120_RACHEL_100_1000	You look cheerful as ever, Ludicolo!
A2_3120_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, I feel a burst of motivation—like her energy’s\nrubbing off on me!
A2_3120_RUNPAPPA_200_1000	Ludi!
A2_3125_TIM_100_1000	Oh, I think the mayor’s big televised announcement\nis about to start.
A2_3125_RACHEL_100_1000	Papa?
A2_3125_TIM_200_1000	The mayor says he’s trying to bring people and\nPokémon together in peace and safety...
A2_3125_RACHEL_200_1000	I just hope it doesn’t mean depriving Pokémon of\ntheir freedom...
A2_3127_TIM_100_1000	Bringing people and Pokémon together in peace and\nsafety, huh...
A2_3127_RACHEL_100_1000	I’d hate it if that became an excuse to strip away\nPokémon’s freedom.
A2_3130_TIM_100_1000	The statue’s still broken.
A2_3130_TIM_100_2000	But there’s no way Pikachu did this. I’ve got to\nsearch harder!
A2_3140_TIM_100_1000	Hm?
A2_3160_TIM_100_1000	Brad was looking around in Fountain Plaza\nyesterday, too.
A2_3160_TIM_100_2000	What in the world is he up to?
A2_3160_RACHEL_100_1000	He might be looking for more evidence of that case\nPikachu’s mixed up in...
A2_3160_TIM_100_3000	Yeah, maybe there’s still something here.
A2_3160_TIM_100_4000	Let’s go see for ourselves.
A2_3170_TIM_100_1000	All right. Time to examine this area.
A2_3170_RACHEL_100_1000	We’re looking for evidence left by the culprit—which\nis another Pikachu, right?
A2_3170_RACHEL_100_2000	But how would it be any different from evidence that\nyour Pikachu could have left?
A2_3170_TIM_100_2000	I’m not sure...but we won’t figure out anything if we\ndon’t look.
A2_3170_RACHEL_100_3000	Good point. We can’t afford to overlook anything.
A2_3175_RACHEL_100_1000	Do you think we’ve missed anything?
A2_3180_TIM_100_1000	Let’s check for any clues that could lead us to the\nPikachu that caused this mess.
A2_3180_TIM_200_1000	Let’s have another look.
A2_3190_TIM_5000_1000	We haven’t examined everything yet...
A2_3200_TIM_100_1000	Look at these Pokémon tracks. They’re pretty big...
A2_3200_RACHEL_100_1000	These definitely weren’t made by Pikachu’s paws.\nAnything else you can tell from them, Tim?
A2_3200_TIM_100_2000	<color=#F39800FF>It looks like this Pokémon was headed toward the\nmain street.</color>
A2_3210_TIM_100_1000	There’s some food on the ground.
A2_3210_RACHEL_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>Maybe it’s some of the food sold at this stall...</color>
A2_3220_RACHEL_100_1000	There’s some paper on the ground.
A2_3220_TIM_100_1000	It’s just a crumpled-up piece of paper. I doubt it’s got\nanything to do with the case.
A2_3230_RACHEL_100_1000	Oh, it’s a bus ticket.
A2_3230_TIM_100_1000	I highly doubt a Pokémon rode the bus by itself...
A2_3230_RACHEL_100_2000	It would be fun if one did, though! I bet that’d be a\nwild ride!
A2_3240_TIM_100_1000	Here are some Pokémon tracks!
A2_3240_RACHEL_100_1000	I can’t say for sure if these were made by a Pikachu,\nbut the size looks about right.
A2_3240_TIM_100_2000	<color=#F39800FF>The trail heads toward the back of the plaza but ends\nabruptly before it gets to 2nd Avenue. </color>I wonder why...
A2_3260_TIM_100_1000	Nothing more to see here.
A2_3270_TIM_100_1000	I think we’ve examined just about everything we can.
A2_3280_TIM_100_1000	There might be someone on 2nd Avenue who saw\nthe other Pikachu.
A2_3280_RACHEL_100_1000	Let’s go there, then!
A2_3290_TIM_100_1000	This is the way to 2nd Avenue...
A2_3290_RACHEL_100_1000	Yeah. I hope we find someone who saw the Pikachu.
A2_3292_RACHEL_100_1000	Aren’t we going to 2nd Avenue?
A2_3292_TIM_100_1000	Sorry, my mistake.
A2_3296_TIM_100_1000	Well, here we are—2nd Avenue.
A2_3296_RACHEL_100_1000	The police station is just to the left of the parking lot\nfull of police cars.
A2_3296_TIM_100_2000	And if we head toward the police station from here,\nthat takes us back to the street the Hi-Hat Café is on.
A2_3296_RACHEL_100_2000	I don’t see any more footprints from that Pokémon.\nIt’s like it just disappeared.
A2_3296_TIM_100_3000	We’ll need to question people for more information\nfrom here on out. Let’s try to find someone who’s seen\nthe Pikachu.
A2_3300_TIM_100_1000	I don’t think there’s any point in going this way.
A2_3310_PHMAN02_100_1000	*sigh* I just can’t believe it, Impidimp...
A2_3310_TIM_100_1000	What’s wrong?
A2_3310_PHMAN02_100_2000	Apparently my partner Impidimp got himself into a\nwhole heap of trouble...
A2_3310_RACHEL_100_1000	Impidimp are known for pulling pranks, aren’t they?
A2_3310_PHMAN02_100_3000	Can’t argue with that. Maybe this was a prank gone\ntoo far?
A2_3310_TIM_100_2000	Do you mind sharing some details with us?
A2_3310_PHMAN02_200_1000	*sigh* What’ve you gotten yourself into, Impidimp...
A2_3310_SEL_0_1000	About Impidimp...
A2_3310_SEL_0_2000	About Pikachu...
A2_3310_SEL_0_3000	About the detained Pokémon...
A2_3310_SEL_0_4000	A Pokémon that can look like others...
A2_3310_TIM_300_1000	So what happened, exactly?
A2_3310_PHMAN02_300_1000	The Pokémon Protection Bureau took my partner\nImpidimp away.
A2_3310_PHMAN02_300_2000	It happened so suddenly, I was completely blindsided.\nI’m practically still in shock!
A2_3310_RACHEL_300_1000	Did one of Impidimp’s pranks cause too much trouble\nfor someone?
A2_3310_PHMAN02_300_3000	Good guess. That’s just what the PPB said.
A2_3310_PHMAN02_300_4000	But somehow I just can’t believe it...
A2_3310_TIM_400_1000	Did you happen to see a Pikachu two nights ago—the\nevening the Slowpoke statue in Fountain Plaza was\ndamaged?
A2_3310_PHMAN02_400_1000	No, I’m afraid not.
A2_3310_TIM_400_2000	We’re trying to track down whoever broke that\nSlowpoke statue.
A2_3310_PHMAN02_400_2000	Oh, you’re a detective? I hope you find the culprit.
A2_3310_TIM_500_1000	What kind of trouble did Impidimp supposedly cause?
A2_3310_PHMAN02_500_1000	<color=#F39800FF>They say my silly little Impidimp stole someone’s\nvaluables.</color>
A2_3310_PHMAN02_500_2000	And that it happened right here, in front of this\nburger joint.
A2_3310_PHMAN02_500_3000	Supposedly, a security camera recorded the whole\nthing, and they’ve got a clear image of Impidimp.
A2_3310_PHMAN02_500_4000	But I just can’t believe it! Despite all appearances,\nImpidimp’s really a good little fella!
A2_3310_PHMAN02_500_7000	He likes shiny things, so yeah, sometimes he’ll bring\nme stuff he finds on the ground...
A2_3310_PHMAN02_500_8000	But only things that are just lying there! He doesn’t\nsteal from people!
A2_3310_RACHEL_500_2000	Hmm... I’d really LIKE to believe you...
A2_3310_PHMAN02_500_9000	I guess I can see why you’d doubt me. Poor Impidimp.
A2_3310_TIM_500_3000	I wonder if Impidimp really is guilty, though. I’d like to\nexamine the scene for a moment.
A2_3310_TIM_600_1000	Can you think of any Pokémon able to make itself\nlook like a different one?
A2_3310_PHMAN02_600_1000	Yeah, I once met an old lady who had a Ditto for\nher partner.
A2_3310_PHMAN02_600_2000	I’m pretty sure she even lived here on 2nd Avenue,\nif memory serves...
A2_3310_TIM_600_2000	Really? Thanks very much!
A2_3310_RACHEL_600_1000	Let’s keep asking around.
A2_3320_RACHEL_100_1000	Let’s ask that person if she’s seen a Pikachu.
A2_3320_TIM_100_2000	Excuse me. Do you have a moment to talk?
A2_3320_PKWOMAN02_100_1000	What about?
A2_3320_PKWOMAN02_200_1000	What do you want to ask?
A2_3320_SEL_0_1000	About Pikachu...
A2_3320_SEL_0_2000	About the detained Pokémon...
A2_3320_TIM_300_1000	Did you happen to see a Pikachu two nights ago—the\nevening the Slowpoke statue in Fountain Plaza was\ndamaged?
A2_3320_PKWOMAN02_300_1000	No, I didn’t. I assume it was detained by the PPB?
A2_3320_TIM_300_2000	The police detained a Pikachu, yes, but we’re looking\nfor a different one.
A2_3320_PKWOMAN02_300_2000	Oh, really? Sorry, I didn’t see any Pikachu.
A2_3320_TIM_300_3000	Thanks. That’s important information.
A2_3320_TIM_400_1000	Have you witnessed any of the recent Pokémon\ndetainments?
A2_3320_PKWOMAN02_400_1000	No, I haven’t seen them myself...
A2_3320_PKWOMAN02_400_2000	<color=#F39800FF>But it does seem as if more and more Pokémon are\nbeing detained lately.</color>
A2_3320_RACHEL_400_1000	Yeah... Feels like there aren’t nearly as many Pokémon\nout and about in the city.
A2_3320_TIM_400_2000	That may be related to this incident with Pikachu.
A2_3330_PCMANMID03_100_1000	This place has the best burgers! I could eat here five\ntimes a day and never get sick of ’em!
A2_3330_TIM_100_1000	Five times a day?! That might be going a bit\noverboard...
A2_3330_PCMANMID03_200_1000	As much as I’d love to talk burgers...you look like\nyou’ve got something else on your mind.
A2_3330_SEL_0_1000	About Pikachu...
A2_3330_SEL_0_2000	About the detained Pokémon...
A2_3330_TIM_300_1000	Did you happen to see a Pikachu two nights ago—the\nevening the Slowpoke statue in Fountain Plaza was\ndamaged?
A2_3330_PCMANMID03_300_1000	Nope, sure didn’t. I was here that night, though.
A2_3330_RACHEL_300_1000	But judging from the tracks, the Pikachu we’re looking\nfor must have walked down this road.
A2_3330_TIM_300_2000	So where could it have gone?
A2_3330_TIM_400_1000	Have you witnessed any of the recent Pokémon\ndetainments?
A2_3330_PCMANMID03_400_1000	I haven’t actually seen any, but I’ve certainly heard\nrumors. People sayin’ the police were by and stuff.
A2_3330_PCMANMID03_400_2000	I sure don’t like all this trouble in the city! Makes it so\nhard to just relax and eat!
A2_3340_TIM_100_1000	Hi there. Do you mind if I ask you some questions?
A2_3340_PXWOMANMID01_100_1000	What do you need?
A2_3340_PXWOMANMID01_200_1000	Do you need something?
A2_3340_SEL_0_1000	About Pikachu...
A2_3340_SEL_0_2000	About the detained Pokémon...
A2_3340_TIM_300_1000	Did you happen to see a Pikachu two nights ago—the\nevening the Slowpoke statue in Fountain Plaza was\ndamaged?
A2_3340_PXWOMANMID01_300_1000	Oh, right. There was a commotion at Fountain Plaza,\nwasn’t there?
A2_3340_PXWOMANMID01_300_2000	I was here that whole evening, and I didn’t see any\nPikachu.
A2_3340_RACHEL_300_1000	So the culprit didn’t come through this square, either?
A2_3340_TIM_400_1000	Have you witnessed any of the recent Pokémon\ndetainments?
A2_3340_PXWOMANMID01_400_1000	Well, I heard that a Pokémon caused some trouble in\nfront of the Hi-Hat Café.
A2_3340_PXWOMANMID01_400_2000	But I didn’t see it for myself, so I don’t know anything\nelse about it.
A2_3350_PAWOMANMID03_100_1000	I love slow, lazy days when the weather’s nice like this.
A2_3350_TIM_100_1000	Me too... But we haven’t been able to take things very\nslowly lately...
A2_3350_PAWOMANMID03_100_2000	Oh? What’s the rush—is something wrong?
A2_3350_PAWOMANMID03_200_1000	Can I help you?
A2_3350_SEL_0_1000	About Pikachu...
A2_3350_SEL_0_2000	About the detained Pokémon...
A2_3350_TIM_300_1000	Did you happen to see a Pikachu two nights ago—the\nevening the Slowpoke statue in Fountain Plaza was\ndamaged?
A2_3350_PAWOMANMID03_300_1000	I saw Morpeko and Dedenne, but no Pikachu.
A2_3350_RACHEL_300_1000	Hey, Tim. Do you think it’s possible that the culprit\nwas actually Morpeko or Dedenne?
A2_3350_TIM_300_2000	No, I unfortunately don’t think so.
A2_3350_TIM_300_3000	Chief Butler said he had proof that a Pikachu did it.
A2_3350_TIM_300_4000	But I believe it must have been a different Pikachu.
A2_3350_TIM_400_1000	Have you witnessed any of the recent Pokémon\ndetainments?
A2_3350_PAWOMANMID03_400_1000	No, I’ve only heard rumors—a Pokémon apparently\nstole someone’s valuables, for example.
A2_3350_PAWOMANMID03_400_2000	Sounds like we all need to be careful... I’d better\nkeep a firm grip on my belongings.
A2_3360_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	*sigh* The mood in the city feels really different\nthese days...
A2_3360_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_100_2000	Pokémon keep causing one problem after another.\nWhat’s up with that?
A2_3370_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	We’ve had so many Pokémon detainment assignments\nlately—it’s pretty shocking how much they’ve spiked!
A2_3380_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	The number of incidents just keeps rising lately...
A2_3380_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_2000	I need to be ready to rush to a crime scene at any\nmoment...
A2_3390_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	No matter when an incident happens, I’ll be ready to\nhead out immediately!
A2_3400_RACHEL_100_1000	Let’s have a look at the shop’s flower display, Tim!
A2_3410_TIM_100_1000	This must be the flower display the police claim\nInteleon ruined...
A2_3410_TIM_200_1000	Let’s check out the flower display again.
A2_3420_TIM_100_1000	OK, let’s see what we can see.
A2_3420_TIM_200_1000	I wonder if there’s something we’ve missed.
A2_3430_TIM_5000_1000	I think there’s still more to see here...
A2_3440_TIM_100_1000	Nothing about the flower shop’s sign seems out of\nthe ordinary here.
A2_3450_RACHEL_100_1000	This pot doesn’t have very many flowers in it.
A2_3450_TIM_100_1000	Some of the flowers have spilled out. I wonder if\nInteleon could have done this...
A2_3460_TIM_100_1000	Just looking at these potted flowers near the shop is\nhelping me feel more relaxed.
A2_3470_TIM_100_1000	Here are some potted flowers. They smell really nice.
A2_3480_TIM_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>There’s a cut in the wall. Looks like it was done by\na sharp blade.</color>
A2_3480_RACHEL_100_1000	A blade, huh. You know, Inteleon’s tail IS kinda\nknife-like...
A2_3480_PHWOMAN01_100_1000	But my Inteleon has never once used its tail like that!
A2_3500_TIM_100_1000	I’m pretty sure we’ve checked out everything here.
A2_3510_TIM_100_1000	Looks like we’ve checked everything of note here.
A2_3520_RACHEL_100_1000	So Morpeko supposedly caused some trouble in front\nof the Hi-Hat Café, right?
A2_3520_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, let’s see if there’s any evidence.
A2_3530_TIM_100_1000	Morpeko’s been accused of stealing some food...\nWe’d better investigate carefully.
A2_3530_TIM_200_1000	I wonder if we’ve missed something.
A2_3540_TIM_100_1000	OK, let’s see what we can see.
A2_3540_TIM_200_1000	Let’s check one more time.
A2_3550_TIM_5000_1000	I think there’s still more to see here...
A2_3560_TIM_100_1000	Just a cup of coffee. Nothing strange about that.
A2_3570_TIM_100_1000	It’s the Hi-Hat Café’s menu. The sandwiches in here\nlook delicious!
A2_3580_TIM_100_1000	The café windows are polished to a shine!
A2_3590_TIM_100_1000	The ground and wall look scorched.
A2_3590_PKMAN01_100_1000	According to the PPB, <color=#F39800FF>Morpeko went berserk and\nused his Aura Wheel</color>.
A2_3590_RACHEL_100_1000	Aura Wheel changes type based on how Morpeko\nis feeling, right?
A2_3590_PKMAN01_100_2000	Yep. When Morpeko’s in Hangry Mode, it’s a Dark-\ntype move, and when Morpeko’s in Full Belly Mode,\nit’s an Electric-type move.
A2_3590_RACHEL_100_2000	If Morpeko’s Aura Wheel were Electric type, that\ncould’ve caused these scorch marks...
A2_3590_TIM_100_2000	But that would mean Morpeko stole someone’s food\neven though it had a full belly.
A2_3590_RACHEL_100_3000	Yeah... You’re right. What’s going on here?
A2_3610_TIM_100_1000	I’m pretty sure we’ve checked out everything here.
A2_3620_TIM_100_1000	Looks like we’ve checked everything of note here.
A2_3630_TIM_100_1000	Wait, isn’t that the guy who—
A2_3650_RACHEL_100_1000	You’ve got a lot of explaining to do!
A2_3650_RACHEL_100_2000	What sort of ideas are you putting into Papa’s head?!
A2_3650_RACHEL_100_3000	And all these Pokémon management measures—are\nthey your doing as well?!
A2_3650_MURDOCH_100_1000	Oh my, oh dear. It seems I’ve caught you in a bad\nmood.
A2_3650_MURDOCH_100_2000	Perhaps we should speak some other time.
A2_3650_MURDOCH_100_3000	If you’ll excuse me. Until next time!
A2_3650_RACHEL_100_4000	Argh... He left without answering a single question.
A2_3650_TIM_100_1000	You may have started off a bit too strong...
A2_3660_TIM_100_1000	The incident that Impidimp is accused of happened\nright in front of the burger shop.
A2_3660_TIM_100_2000	Let’s look for some evidence.
A2_3670_TIM_100_1000	This is where Impidimp reportedly stole someone’s\nvaluables. There might still be some clues around.
A2_3670_TIM_200_1000	I wonder if we’ve missed something.
A2_3680_TIM_100_1000	OK, let’s see what we can see.
A2_3690_TIM_5000_1000	I think there’s still more to see here...
A2_3700_TIM_100_1000	The burger joint’s menu. A burger sure would hit the\nspot right about now...
A2_3710_TIM_100_1000	Lickilicky is the burger joint’s mascot. Whoever they\ngot to make this statue did a good job.
A2_3720_TIM_100_1000	A poster for the burger joint. Looks like they’re\nrunning a special deal right now.
A2_3730_TIM_100_1000	An illuminated sign displaying the name of the burger\njoint. I don’t see anything out of the ordinary.
A2_3740_TIM_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>There’s a really shiny coin on the ground.</color>
A2_3740_TIM_100_2000	Did this get dropped here during the incident\nwith Impidimp?
A2_3740_RACHEL_100_1000	If so, that’d be a little strange...
A2_3740_TIM_100_3000	Yeah. We did hear that Impidimp loves shiny things...
A2_3740_PHMAN02_100_1000	Exactly! Impidimp would have picked this coin up.
A2_3740_TIM_100_4000	So then why is the coin here?
A2_3760_TIM_100_1000	I’m pretty sure we’ve checked out everything here.
A2_3770_TIM_100_1000	Looks like we’ve checked everything of note here.
A2_3780_TIM_100_1000	The people who should know the most about the\nPokémon detainments...
A2_3780_RACHEL_100_1000	...Are the Pokémon Protection Bureau and the police.
A2_3780_TIM_100_2000	But Inspector Holiday didn’t know much of anything.
A2_3780_RACHEL_100_2000	Maybe we should ask some other police officers.
A2_3780_TIM_100_3000	Good idea, let’s do that.
A2_3790_PAPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	Incidents have been on the rise lately. Take care of\nyourself out there.
A2_3790_TIM_100_1000	Excuse me. I’d like to ask a few questions, if that’s\nall right with you.
A2_3790_PAPOLICEMAN01_200_1000	Incidents have been on the rise lately. Take care of\nyourself out there.
A2_3790_SEL_0_1000	About Pokémon detainment...
A2_3790_PAPOLICEMAN01_300_1000	Is something wrong?
A2_3790_TIM_300_1000	We’re actually looking for the people who’ve been\nhandling Pokémon detainment.
A2_3790_PAPOLICEMAN01_300_2000	That’s not one of my assignments.
A2_3790_PAPOLICEMAN01_300_3000	My duties keep me here at the station.
A2_3790_RACHEL_300_1000	Then how can we get in touch with someone who has\nbeen assigned to Pokémon detainment?
A2_3790_PAPOLICEMAN01_300_4000	Why don’t you try asking the two officers in the\nparking lot out back?
A2_3800_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	We’ve had so many Pokémon detainment assignments\nlately—it’s pretty shocking how much they’ve spiked!
A2_3800_TIM_100_1000	Actually, that’s exactly what I’d like to ask you about.
A2_3800_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_100_2000	Huh. Fancy that.
A2_3800_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_200_1000	You’re back? You must be awfully interested in\npolice work.
A2_3800_SEL_0_1000	About Pokémon detainment...
A2_3800_TIM_300_1000	Is Pokémon detainment one of your assigned duties?
A2_3800_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_300_1000	Yes, it is. Recently, it feels like detaining Pokémon is\nall I do.
A2_3800_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_300_2000	Frankly, that’s supposed to be the PPB’s responsibility.
A2_3800_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_300_3000	But they’re such a new organization, they don’t have\nenough personnel—leaving police officers like me to\npick up their slack.
A2_3800_TIM_300_2000	That sounds really tough. I’m sure your department\nalready has enough on their plate.
A2_3800_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_300_4000	Well, I wouldn’t say that.
A2_3800_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_300_4500	The official story is that the PPB was formed to assist\nthe police—keep us from spreading ourselves too thin,\nthat sorta thing.
A2_3800_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_300_5000	But between you and me, <color=#F39800FF>Ryme City’s never given us\nmore police work than we can handle</color>.
A2_3800_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_300_5500	I think the PPB was established as part of the mayor’s\nvision for the city.
A2_3800_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_300_6000	But—and this goes without saying—working with\npeople and Pokémon are two different ball games.
A2_3800_RACHEL_300_1000	Yeah. People have their individual quirks, but at least\nwe’re all one species. Pokémon, on the other hand...
A2_3800_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_300_7000	Exactly. There’s an infinite number of variables we\nneed to be able to respond to in any given situation.
A2_3800_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_300_8000	Sometimes it all feels way above my pay grade, but\nwith the direction the mayor and the PPB are taking\nthings, there’s not much I can do.
A2_3810_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	If danger rears its head, you can trust the Ryme City\nPolice to protect and serve!
A2_3810_TIM_100_1000	Sorry, I’d just like to ask a few questions if that’s OK...
A2_3810_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_2000	Questions for me? I’m happy to answer anything\nI can!
A2_3810_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_200_1000	Anything else troubling you?
A2_3810_SEL_0_1000	About Pokémon detainment...
A2_3810_TIM_300_1000	Is Pokémon detainment one of your assignments?
A2_3810_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_300_1000	Yes, it sure is!
A2_3810_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_300_2000	And we’re being extra vigilant for the remainder of\nPokémon Friendship Week!
A2_3810_TIM_300_2000	Mayor Myers has been promoting it a lot lately.
A2_3810_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_300_3000	Yes, he has! <color=#F39800FF>Pokémon Friendship Week was created\nin response to the R incident two years ago.</color>
A2_3810_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_300_4000	It represents our ideals of peaceful coexistence\nwith Pokémon...
A2_3810_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_300_5000	As officers of the law, we work hard to protect\nthat peace!
A2_3810_RACHEL_300_1000	Oh, I see... The police are lucky to have an officer\nlike you!
A2_3810_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_300_6000	If anything happens, we’ll be there in no time, so you\ncan put your mind at ease!
A2_3810_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_300_7000	Thanks to the state-of-the-art surveillance cameras\nwe’ve begun using, not a single incident slips by\nunrecorded!
A2_3810_TIM_300_3000	Are the cameras really all that special?
A2_3810_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_300_8000	They are! <color=#F39800FF>Our cameras have captured the\nincriminating moment in every recent incident!</color>
A2_3810_TIM_300_4000	Really? Every last one?
A2_3810_RACHEL_300_2000	Are you sure that isn’t just a coincidence? I’m sure\nthose cameras are amazing, but that sounds too good\nto be true.
A2_3810_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_300_9000	We don’t have a lot of surveillance cameras at our\ndisposal, but the few we use are extremely effective!
A2_3820_TIM_100_1000	All this time I’ve just assumed there was another\nPikachu...
A2_3820_TIM_100_2000	But now I’m having second thoughts.
A2_3820_RACHEL_100_1000	What do you mean?
A2_3820_TIM_100_3000	So many Pokémon have caused incidents and been\ndetained in such a short time.
A2_3820_TIM_100_4000	And it seems that the incriminating detail for every\none of these incidents has been captured on camera.
A2_3820_TIM_100_5000	Rather than finding a double for each and every\none of these Pokémon...
A2_3820_TIM_100_6000	it would be much easier for them to use just one\nPokémon capable of passing as any one of the others.
A2_3820_TIM_100_7000	If they had a Pokémon that could do that—
A2_3820_RACHEL_100_2000	Yeah! If they had a Pokémon like that...
A2_3820_RACHEL_100_3000	it could explain how so many of these incidents\noccurred in such a short time!
A2_3820_TIM_100_8000	So what we should be looking for is—
A2_3820_RACHEL_100_4000	A Pokémon that can look like other Pokémon!
A2_3820_TIM_100_9000	Right! Let’s ask around more!
A2_3825_SECRETPKWOMANOLD01_100_1000	Oh, Ditto, deeear!
A2_3825_TIM_100_1000	Hm? Did you hear someone calling for something?
A2_3825_SECRETPKWOMANOLD01_100_2000	Diiittooo! *sigh* ...Where can it be?
A2_3825_RACHEL_100_1000	Oh, I bet that’s Ditto’s partner!
A2_3825_TIM_100_2000	I think the voice is coming from back here. Let’s\ngo check!
A2_3830_TIM_100_1000	Hello there. Do you mind if I ask you some questions?
A2_3830_PKWOMANOLD01_100_1000	Sure, go right ahead. I’ve been so lonely, it’s nice to\nhave a distraction.
A2_3830_PKWOMANOLD01_200_1000	It seems there’s something you want to ask me.
A2_3830_SEL_0_1000	What’s troubling you?
A2_3830_TIM_300_1000	What’s wrong?
A2_3830_PKWOMANOLD01_300_1000	Well, you see, my dear Ditto went missing a\nwhile ago.
A2_3830_TIM_300_2000	So that was your voice we heard just now.
A2_3830_PKWOMANOLD01_300_2000	Yes, I’ve been looking for it everywhere but I just\ncan’t find it! I’m worried sick...
A2_3830_RACHEL_300_1000	I hope it shows up again soon...
A2_3830_PKWOMANOLD01_300_4000	Thanks for trying to cheer me up. I really do miss\nmy Ditto.
A2_3830_PKWOMANOLD01_300_5000	Ditto loves to play by using Transform. It turns into\nall sorts of things!
A2_3830_PKWOMANOLD01_300_6000	<color=#F39800FF>But my little one isn’t actually very good at using\nTransform. It can only imitate what it sees with its\nown eyes.</color>
A2_3830_PKWOMANOLD01_300_7000	Sometimes it gets the shape a bit wrong, but that just\nmakes it even cuter!
A2_3840_RACHEL_100_1000	That poor woman...
A2_3840_TIM_100_1000	She said Ditto’s been missing for a little while now,\nright?
A2_3840_RACHEL_100_2000	I know it fits the profile for what we’ve been searching\nfor, but...could it really have gotten tangled up in all\nthese incidents?
A2_3840_TIM_100_2000	It’s possible, yeah...
A2_3840_RACHEL_100_3000	Is there any way to be sure?
A2_3840_TIM_100_4000	Yes! I can ask Pikachu!
A2_3840_RACHEL_100_4000	Ask...Pikachu?
A2_3840_TIM_100_5000	Oh, uh...yeah. It’s about time for my visit with him.
A2_3840_TIM_100_6000	So I’ll discuss—I mean, uh, talk with... You know, let’s\njust go see how he’s doing.
A2_3840_RACHEL_100_5000	Are you sure I can join in on this visit, even though I’m\nnot his partner?
A2_3840_TIM_100_7000	Yeah, it should be fine. Come on—let’s go!
A2_3850_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	Let me explain our Pokémon partner visitation rules.
A2_3850_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_2000	Visits are allowed in the afternoons.
A2_3850_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_3000	You can visit your partner a maximum of twice per\nday, but they cannot be consecutive visits.
A2_3850_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_4000	Are you ready to visit your partner?
A2_3850_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_3850_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_3850_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_300_1000	Then follow me.
A2_3850_TIM_400_1000	Sorry, I need a bit more time first.
A2_3910_RACHEL_100_1000	So this is the visitation room. I feel a little nervous\nin here...
A2_3910_TIM_100_1000	Oh yeah, it’s your first time here.
A2_3910_TIM_100_2000	Uh...wait.
A2_3910_RACHEL_100_2000	What is it, Tim?
A2_3910_TIM_100_3000	Oh, uh, nothing... Could you actually wait a second\nfor me, Rachel?
A2_3910_TIM_100_4000	(Yikes, what do I do?)
A2_3910_TIM_100_5000	(I’ve been keeping the fact that Pikachu and I can\nspeak to each other a secret...)
A2_3910_TIM_100_6000	(What’s Rachel going to think when she sees me\ntalking to him?)
A2_3910_TIM_100_7000	(If we’re going to keep investigating together, I should\njust tell her the truth...)
A2_3910_RACHEL_100_3000	Are you OK, Tim? You look like you’re thinking\nawfully hard.
A2_3910_TIM_100_8000	... ... ...
A2_3923_RACHEL_100_1000	... ... ...
A2_3923_TIM_100_1000	I know it must be shocking to hear someone say a\nthing like that...
A2_3923_TIM_100_2000	If you don’t believe me, I understand.
A2_3923_RACHEL_100_2000	...Amazing.
A2_3923_TIM_100_3000	Huh?
A2_3923_RACHEL_100_3000	That’s incredible, Tim! I’m so jealous that you can\ncommunicate with Pokémon!
A2_3923_RACHEL_100_4000	So when you said you’d been solving cases with\nPikachu...you really meant it literally!
A2_3923_RACHEL_100_5000	How are you able to talk with him? Do you know\nhow that happened?
A2_3923_TIM_100_4000	Honestly, I’m not sure myself. He’s the only Pokémon\nI can understand, too.
A2_3923_TIM_100_5000	Pikachu interprets for me when I’m speaking to other\nPokémon.
A2_3923_RACHEL_100_6000	Wow... Pikachu’s pretty clever!
A2_3923_RACHEL_100_7000	It must be your strong bond of trust with Pikachu\nthat lets you understand him!
A2_3923_TIM_100_6000	Hmm... But we were able to talk as soon as we met...
A2_3923_RACHEL_100_8000	Then maybe you just instinctually understood each\nother’s feelings from the start?
A2_3923_TIM_100_7000	Yeah, maybe...
A2_3923_TIM_100_8000	But hey, you’re pretty amazing yourself, you know!
A2_3923_TIM_100_9000	You’ve studied so much about Pokémon, and it’s clear\nhow much you care about them...
A2_3923_RACHEL_100_9000	Thanks, Tim. I appreciate you saying that.
A2_3923_RACHEL_100_10000	I’ve always...ALWAYS felt this way—that I want to\nunderstand Pokémon better, and have them\nunderstand me as well.
A2_3923_TIM_100_10000	Always, huh?
A2_3923_RACHEL_100_11000	Yeah. A Pokémon rescued me when I was just a little\nkid, you know.
A2_3930_RACHEL_100_1000	I remember that day so clearly.
A2_3930_RACHEL_100_2000	That Ursaring and I really connected back then,\nheart to heart.
A2_3930_RACHEL_100_3000	And when I told Mama and Papa about it...
A2_3930_RACHEL_100_4000	they said that humans and Pokémon were always\nmeant to be that close.
A2_3930_RACHEL_100_5000	But Papa’s changed...
A2_3930_RACHEL_100_6000	All this Pokémon “management” stuff is so unlike\nhim—and when they’ve done nothing wrong!
A2_3930_TIM_100_1000	I understand how you feel, Rachel.
A2_3930_RACHEL_100_7000	Thanks, Tim.
A2_3940_RACHEL_100_1000	Do you think Pikachu will get here soon?
A2_3940_RACHEL_100_2000	I may not be able to understand him, but it’ll be a\nrelief just to see him safe and sound.
A2_3940_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, that’s how I felt when I visited him yesterday.
A2_3960_PAPOLICEMAN02_100_1000	Here’s Pikachu!
A2_3960_PIKACHU_100_1000	I wonder if Tim’s made any progress in his\ninvestigation.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Tim! Thanks for coming to see me!
A2_3970_TIM_100_1000	I’m glad to see you’re OK, Pikachu.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh, and Rachel’s here too!
A2_3970_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hey Tim...are you sure this is OK? Letting her see us\ntalk like this?
A2_3970_TIM_100_2000	About that...I actually just told Rachel our secret a\nminute ago.
A2_3970_TIM_100_3000	She knows that you and I can talk to each other.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_100_4000	Wow, that was pretty bold of you. Did she even\nbelieve you?
A2_3970_TIM_100_4000	Yeah, she even said she was jealous.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_100_5000	Hahaha! Well, that’s a relief! Rachel’s a bit of an odd\none, isn’t she?
A2_3970_PIKACHU_100_6000	Either way, there’s still an officer in the room, so we\nshould keep it down.
A2_3970_TIM_100_5000	Yeah, I know.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_100_7000	So anyway, let’s get straight to the point. I’ve got\nsomething to report to you, Tim.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_100_8000	I managed to get help from the other Pokémon in the\ndetainment rooms.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_100_9000	Now I can see into all sorts of different places inside\nthe police station.
A2_3970_TIM_100_6000	Wow, that’s fantastic! Good thing you figured out how\nto get along with them.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_100_10000	We’re not exactly best friends or anything like that,\nbut I guess that’s OK.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_100_11000	There’s something else I wanted to talk to you about,\ntoo. Come on—let’s pool our information.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_200_1000	Did you need to confirm something?
A2_3970_SEL_0_1000	What you’ve found...
A2_3970_SEL_0_2000	Where the other Pikachu went...
A2_3970_SEL_0_3000	About the Pokémon in the station...
A2_3970_PIKACHU_300_1000	I found this photo of the incident occurring at\nFountain Plaza. Check it out.
A2_3970_TIM_300_1000	It’s a Pikachu!
A2_3970_PIKACHU_300_2000	And I don’t gotta tell you it’s not me! That other\nPikachu’s the real culprit.
A2_3970_TIM_300_2000	But that’s your hat in the picture.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_300_3000	Yeah, somebody must’ve gotten it specifically to\nframe me.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_300_4000	But it’s obvious that it isn’t me, right?
A2_3970_TIM_300_3000	Right. <color=#F39800FF>You’ve got stripes on your back, but the\nPikachu in this photo doesn’t have any.</color>
A2_3970_PIKACHU_300_5000	Exactly. And I’m curious about that thing on its back.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_300_6000	<color=#F39800FF>It’s the same device that I’ve got on my back</color> right\nnow too.
A2_3970_TIM_300_4000	I asked around the city yesterday about those devices.
A2_3970_TIM_300_5000	Based on the testimony I gathered, I’m pretty sure\nthey’re meant to keep Pokémon pacified.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_300_7000	To keep them from going berserk, you mean?
A2_3970_PIKACHU_400_1000	Were you able to track down the real culprit—the\nother Pikachu?
A2_3970_TIM_400_1000	No... We found some tracks, but they trailed off.\nI don’t know where it went.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_400_2000	Too bad...
A2_3970_TIM_400_2000	Sorry I haven’t been able to prove your innocence yet.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_400_3000	Hey, no need to apologize! I know you’re tryin’\nyour best!
A2_3970_PIKACHU_400_4000	If you couldn’t find it, you couldn’t find it. What’s\nimportant is what you do next!
A2_3970_TIM_400_3000	Yeah. And as for that double of yours...
A2_3970_TIM_400_4000	I think there’s a high chance that a different Pokémon\nwas impersonating you.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_400_5000	You think so? Now there’s an intriguing theory.
A2_3970_TIM_500_1000	By the way, Pikachu, what kinds of Pokémon are\nhelping you in there?
A2_3970_PIKACHU_500_1000	There’s lots of ’em, but the most helpful one is Luxray.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_500_2000	He’s a bit rough around the edges, but he can see\nthrough objects and use <color=#F39800FF>powerful Electric-type moves</color>.
A2_3970_TIM_500_2000	That vision thing sounds pretty handy. But if he knows\nstrong Electric-type moves...
A2_3970_PIKACHU_500_3000	Lemme stop you right there—I don’t think Luxray’s\nthe culprit at all.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_500_4000	If he were, the PPB wouldn’t have had any cause to\narrest me in the first place.
A2_3970_TIM_500_3000	Yeah, good point.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_500_5000	Oh, that reminds me—Luxray asked me to pass on a\nmessage to you.
A2_3970_TIM_500_4000	What is it?
A2_3970_PIKACHU_500_6000	He wants to know how his friend Mightyena is doing\nout there.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_500_7000	The two of ’em got in a fight, and Luxray’s worried\nabout what happened in the aftermath.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_500_8000	He says Mightyena usually hangs around 2nd Avenue.
A2_3970_TIM_500_5000	Got it. I’ll keep an eye out for Mightyena and let you\nknow how it’s doing.
A2_3970_PIKACHU_500_9000	Thanks, Tim.
A2_3980_PIKACHU_100_1000	So, any guesses about what Pokémon was pretending\nto be me?
A2_3980_TIM_100_1000	I have an idea, but I need to consider all the\npossibilities. Let’s see...
A2_3990_RACHEL_100_1000	How did your talk with Pikachu go?
A2_3990_TIM_100_1000	As it turns out, he’s been investigating the police\nstation top to bottom.
A2_3990_RACHEL_100_2000	Wow! Just like a spy!
A2_3990_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, I’m not a spy—I’m a great detective!
A2_3990_RACHEL_200_1000	I wish I could understand what Pokémon were saying...
A2_3995_PHPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	Standing guard sure is boring...
A2_4000_TIM_100_1000	If the PPB and the police have been using Ditto...
A2_4000_PIKACHU_100_1000	...Then they’re definitely up to no good.
A2_4000_TIM_100_2000	So that’s it...
A2_4000_PIKACHU_100_2000	What is it, Tim?
A2_4000_TIM_100_3000	I saw Brad out and about several times while I was\ninvestigating.
A2_4000_TIM_100_4000	He seemed to be examining the scene of the crime—\na crime which already had a culprit.
A2_4000_PIKACHU_100_3000	That’s kinda suspicious.
A2_4000_TIM_100_5000	I really don’t want to suspect Brad, but I can’t help\nbut wonder what he was up to.
A2_4000_PIKACHU_100_4000	Yeah, Brad may be a bit of a jerk, but still, we’ve\nknown him for two years now.
A2_4000_PIKACHU_100_5000	I don’t like having to think of him as a suspect...
A2_4000_PIKACHU_100_6000	But you need to look into what he’s been up to, Tim.
A2_4000_TIM_100_6000	But...
A2_4000_PIKACHU_100_7000	Tim, you’re a detective, aren’t you?
A2_4000_PIKACHU_100_8000	You’re not trying to bring Brad down. You’re only\ntrying to uncover the truth.
A2_4000_TIM_100_7000	Yeah...you’re right.
A2_4000_PIKACHU_100_9000	And look into the cube-shaped devices, too.
A2_4000_PIKACHU_100_10000	I understand their function to pacify Pokémon.
A2_4000_PIKACHU_100_11000	But that alone doesn’t explain everything.
A2_4000_TIM_100_8000	You’re right. The Pikachu in the photo damaged that\nSlowpoke statue.
A2_4000_TIM_100_9000	The devices may have some other function as well.
A2_40010_TIM_100_1000	I feel like my investigation’s stalled out a bit.
A2_40010_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... Should I try to organize my thoughts?
A2_40010_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40010_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40010_TIM_300_1000	Whatever Pokémon is responsible for the incident\napparently broke something in Fountain Plaza.
A2_40010_TIM_300_2000	I should take a close look at the scene of the crime.
A2_40010_TIM_300_3000	There’s bound to be some evidence that can point me\nin the direction of the Pokémon responsible for this.
A2_40010_TIM_400_1000	Nah, I’ll do that later.
A2_40020_TIM_100_1000	I feel like my investigation’s stalled out a bit.
A2_40020_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... Should I try to organize my thoughts?
A2_40020_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40020_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40020_TIM_300_1000	Somebody must have seen where Pikachu was at the\ntime of the incident.
A2_40020_TIM_300_2000	Hmm. He’s been going to the Hi-Hat Café a lot...
A2_40020_TIM_300_3000	Maybe asking around the café will turn something up.
A2_40020_TIM_400_1000	Nah, I’ll do that later.
A2_40025_TIM_100_1000	I feel like my investigation’s stalled out a bit.
A2_40025_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... Should I try to organize my thoughts?
A2_40025_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40025_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40025_TIM_300_1000	We don’t really have enough information out here to\nthink this through.
A2_40025_TIM_300_2000	I should probably talk to Pikachu.
A2_40025_TIM_400_1000	Nah, I’ll do that later.
A2_40030_TIM_100_1000	I feel like my investigation’s stalled out a bit.
A2_40030_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... Should I try to organize my thoughts?
A2_40030_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40030_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40030_TIM_300_1000	Assuming another Pikachu committed the crime,\nwhere could it have gone?
A2_40030_TIM_300_2000	I should ask around at Fountain Plaza.
A2_40030_TIM_300_3000	Surely someone must have seen something.
A2_40030_TIM_400_1000	Nah, I’ll do that later.
A2_40035_TIM_100_1000	I feel like my investigation’s stalled out a bit.
A2_40035_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... Should I try to organize my thoughts?
A2_40035_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40035_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40035_TIM_300_1000	Brad seemed to be investigating something.
A2_40035_TIM_300_2000	Maybe I’ll discover a clue if I examine the same spot.
A2_40035_TIM_400_1000	Nah, I’ll do that later.
A2_40040_TIM_100_1000	I feel like my investigation’s stalled out a bit.
A2_40040_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... Should I try to organize my thoughts?
A2_40040_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40040_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40040_TIM_300_1000	There aren’t many people out and about right now, so\nI should try gathering information at the Hi-Hat Café.
A2_40040_TIM_300_2000	The café’s always got people around, day and night,\nso it’s my best bet at learning something new.
A2_40040_TIM_400_1000	Nah, I’ll do that later.
A2_40050_TIM_100_1000	I feel like my investigation’s stalled out a bit.
A2_40050_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... Should I try to organize my thoughts?
A2_40050_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40050_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40050_TIM_300_1000	We’ve heard that more and more Pokémon are being\ndetained, but what exactly is causing that?
A2_40050_TIM_300_2000	Let’s interview witnesses to get information and\nexamine the scenes of these crimes.
A2_40050_TIM_300_3000	Checking out the actual scenes may help us learn\nmore details.
A2_40050_TIM_400_1000	Nah, I’ll do that later.
A2_40060_TIM_100_1000	I feel like my investigation’s stalled out a bit.
A2_40060_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... Should I try to organize my thoughts?
A2_40060_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40060_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40060_TIM_300_1000	All of these Pokémon incidents have been solved\nso quickly, and the culprits detained. It’s almost\nTOO smooth.
A2_40060_TIM_300_2000	I should talk to the police—they’re the ones actually\ndetaining the Pokémon.
A2_40060_TIM_300_3000	Maybe I’ll be able to start putting some pieces\ntogether.
A2_40060_TIM_400_1000	Nah, I’ll do that later.
A2_40070_TIM_100_1000	I feel like my investigation’s stalled out a bit.
A2_40070_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... Should I try to organize my thoughts?
A2_40070_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40070_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40070_TIM_300_1000	None of the detained Pokémon are guilty—the real\nculprit’s got to be some other Pokémon.
A2_40070_TIM_300_2000	They say that when each incident occurred, the crime\nwas caught on surveillance cameras...
A2_40070_TIM_300_3000	But it’s possible that a different Pokémon was posing\nas the others.
A2_40070_TIM_300_4000	We should ask around the city about Pokémon who\ncould pull that off.
A2_40070_TIM_400_1000	Nah, I’ll do that later.
A2_40075_TIM_100_1000	I feel like my investigation’s stalled out a bit.
A2_40075_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... Should I try to organize my thoughts?
A2_40075_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40075_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40075_TIM_300_1000	We don’t really have enough information out here to\nthink this through.
A2_40075_TIM_300_2000	I should probably talk to Pikachu.
A2_40075_TIM_400_1000	Nah, I’ll do that later.
A2_40080_TIM_100_1000	I feel like my investigation’s stalled out a bit.
A2_40080_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... Should I try to organize my thoughts?
A2_40080_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40080_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40080_TIM_300_1000	What was Brad doing at the crime scenes?
A2_40080_TIM_300_2000	We should ask around the city and try to get some\nstatements from people who’ve seen Brad.
A2_40080_TIM_400_1000	Nah, I’ll do that later.
A2_40090_TIM_100_1000	I feel like my investigation’s stalled out a bit.
A2_40090_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... Should I try to organize my thoughts?
A2_40090_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40090_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40090_TIM_300_1000	Who’s actually causing these incidents?
A2_40090_TIM_300_2000	I should use the evidence Pikachu found to make\nsome deductions.
A2_40090_TIM_400_1000	Nah, I’ll do that later.
A2_4010_PAPOLICEMAN02_100_1000	Visiting time is over.
A2_4010_PIKACHU_100_1000	Ugh, I wish we had more time... Good luck with your\ninvestigation!
A2_4010_PIKACHU_100_2000	Ugh... Not this... Darn it!
A2_4010_TIM_100_1000	What is it, Pikachu?
A2_4010_PIKACHU_100_3000	It’s just like yesterday...that feeling when I’m about\nto lose my memories...
A2_4010_PIKACHU_100_4000	And my body’s moving on its own...
A2_4010_TIM_100_2000	Pikachu!
A2_4010_TIM_100_3000	...It’s no use.
A2_4010_RACHEL_100_1000	Is Pikachu OK? He was walking kinda strange\njust now...
A2_4010_TIM_100_4000	He was like that after our first visit too. I’m worried\nabout him...
A2_40100_TIM_100_1000	I feel like my investigation’s stalled out a bit.
A2_40100_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... Should I try to organize my thoughts?
A2_40100_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40100_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40100_TIM_300_1000	What exactly does that device on Pikachu’s back do?
A2_40100_TIM_300_2000	I wonder if anyone in the city witnessed anything.
A2_40100_TIM_300_3000	I’ll try asking around.
A2_40100_TIM_400_1000	On second thought, now’s not the time.
A2_40110_TIM_100_1000	I feel like my investigation’s stalled out a bit.
A2_40110_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... Should I try to organize my thoughts?
A2_40110_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40110_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40110_TIM_300_1000	I wish I could find a witness who actually saw\nsomeone giving orders through that device...
A2_40110_TIM_300_2000	I’m not sure how much more I can investigate on my\nown right now. I should talk this over with Pikachu\nwhen I visit.
A2_40110_TIM_400_1000	On second thought, now’s not the time.
A2_40115_TIM_100_1000	I feel like my investigation’s stalled out a bit.
A2_40115_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... Should I try to organize my thoughts?
A2_40115_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40115_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40115_TIM_300_1000	We don’t really have enough information out here to\nthink this through.
A2_40115_TIM_300_2000	I should probably talk to Pikachu.
A2_40115_TIM_400_1000	Maybe later.
A2_40120_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wait, what’s the passcode again?
A2_40120_PIKACHU_100_2000	Maybe I should double-check.
A2_40120_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40120_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40120_PIKACHU_300_1000	The passcode is 2168.
A2_40120_PIKACHU_400_1000	Nah, I’m good.
A2_40120_PIKACHU_400_2000	Just gotta hurry and type the number in.
A2_40130_PIKACHU_100_1000	What was that passcode again...?
A2_40130_PIKACHU_100_2000	Maybe I should double-check.
A2_40130_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40130_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40130_PIKACHU_300_1000	The passcode to the safe is 515020.
A2_40130_PIKACHU_400_1000	Nah, I’m pretty sure I’m fine.
A2_40130_PIKACHU_400_2000	Now to enter the number...
A2_40140_TIM_100_1000	I’ve got all the information I need to figure this out.
A2_40140_TIM_100_2000	I should be able to figure this out if I just stop and\nthink things over. Maybe I should do that now...
A2_40140_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40140_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_40150_TIM_100_1000	I’ve got all the information I need to figure this out.

A2_40240_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_40240_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_4110_TIM_100_1000	So there are two things we need to do:
A2_4110_TIM_100_2000	First, find Brad.
A2_4110_TIM_100_3000	Second, look into what those cube-shaped devices\nactually do.
A2_4110_RACHEL_100_1000	Is Brad that man we saw in the plaza? You know him,\nright?
A2_4110_RACHEL_100_2000	I hope you don’t end up squaring off against each\nother because of this case.
A2_4110_TIM_100_4000	Yeah, that’d be pretty scary...but we don’t know for\nsure yet that that’ll even happen.
A2_4110_TIM_100_5000	Let’s just concentrate on uncovering the truth.
A2_4110_TIM_100_6000	Oh, and one more thing: if we see Mightyena, we\nneed to check and see how it’s doing.
A2_4110_RACHEL_100_3000	Mightyena?
A2_4110_TIM_100_7000	Yeah, Pikachu asked me to check on it.
A2_4110_TIM_100_8000	Apparently it’s friends with a Luxray in the station.
A2_4110_RACHEL_100_4000	Wow, you talked about all that? It just sounded like\n“pika pika” to me.
A2_4110_TIM_100_9000	Yeah, that’s normal. I’m pretty sure I’m the weird\none here.
A2_4110_RACHEL_100_5000	Not weird, Tim—exceptional!
A2_4110_TIM_100_10000	Heh, thanks, Rachel. I’m glad I opened up to you!
A2_4110_PAPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	Umm...Detectives?
A2_4110_TIM_100_11000	Oh, sorry! I guess we shouldn’t keep talking here...
A2_4110_PAPOLICEMAN01_100_2000	No, that’s fine. Were you talking about Brad\njust now?
A2_4110_TIM_100_12000	Yes, there’s something we’d like to ask him about.
A2_4110_PAPOLICEMAN01_100_3000	Well, if you’re looking for Brad, he just headed out to\n2nd Avenue on new orders.
A2_4110_TIM_100_13000	Really? Thanks for letting us know!
A2_4110_RACHEL_100_6000	OK, we’re headed to 2nd Avenue, right? Let’s go hear\nwhat Brad has to say!
A2_4120_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	We do not allow multiple visitations in a row.
A2_4130_LIVOLT02_100_1000	Manec!
A2_4130_RACHEL_100_1000	It’d be nice if you could understand Manectric too.
A2_4130_TIM_100_1000	Yeah... I just hope this one doesn’t hate detectives.
A2_4140_PAPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	Back to visit your Pikachu again, are you?
A2_4140_PAPOLICEMAN01_100_2000	You sure are passionate about this case.
A2_4140_TIM_100_1000	Actually, that’s not why I’m here. Can I ask you a\nquestion or two?
A2_4140_PAPOLICEMAN01_200_1000	How can I help you, Detective?
A2_4140_SEL_0_1000	About the situation in the city...
A2_4140_SEL_0_2000	About Brad...
A2_4140_SEL_0_3000	About the cube-shaped device...
A2_4140_TIM_300_1000	Did anything strange happen in the city today?
A2_4140_PAPOLICEMAN01_300_1000	I dunno if I’d necessarily call it strange, but there have\nbeen several Pokémon-related incidents.
A2_4140_PAPOLICEMAN01_300_2000	At this rate, they’re going to fill up every detainment\nroom we’ve got.
A2_4140_RACHEL_300_1000	That must be pretty stressful for the Pokémon...
A2_4140_PAPOLICEMAN01_300_3000	If they’re stressed, they can work it out during their\ndaily exercise time.
A2_4140_TIM_400_1000	Thanks for letting us know about Lieutenant\nMcMaster.
A2_4140_PAPOLICEMAN01_400_1000	No trouble at all. What did you need him for,\nanyway?
A2_4140_TIM_400_2000	Oh, I just...remembered something about the incident\nPikachu was involved in.
A2_4140_TIM_400_3000	I thought it could help with the investigation, so I\nwanted to tell the lieutenant in person.
A2_4140_PAPOLICEMAN01_400_2000	Understood. Thanks for reporting whatever info\nyou can!
A2_4140_TIM_500_1000	Do you know anything about those cube-shaped\ndevices being put on Pokémon as they’re detained?
A2_4140_PAPOLICEMAN01_500_1000	Oh, those things? I hear they’re management tags.
A2_4140_PAPOLICEMAN01_500_2000	I don’t quite understand how they work, but they’re\npretty interesting.
A2_4140_PAPOLICEMAN01_500_3000	<color=#F39800FF>The moment a Pokémon is outfitted with a device,\nit goes with the police without any resistance.</color>
A2_4140_TIM_500_2000	Really? The Pokémon do that on their own?
A2_4140_PAPOLICEMAN01_500_4000	Yes. It’s much safer when they aren’t violent.
A2_4150_PABLO_100_1000	Hey, Tim. I take it Pikachu’s not out yet?
A2_4150_TIM_100_1000	No, he’s not.
A2_4150_PABLO_100_2000	Sorry to hear that... He’s one of my favorite regulars,\nso this place gets kinda lonely when he’s not around.
A2_4150_PABLO_200_1000	This place just isn’t the same without Pikachu around.
A2_4160_RUNPAPPA_100_1000	Ludi?
A2_4160_TIM_100_1000	Ludicolo looks like she’s asking a question. What do\nyou suppose it is?
A2_4160_RACHEL_100_1000	I wonder if she’s asking where Pikachu is.
A2_4160_RUNPAPPA_200_1000	Ludi?
A2_4165_TIM_100_1000	The news is on. Looks like there were more\nPokémon-related incidents today.
A2_4165_RACHEL_100_1000	At this rate, it seems like they’ll never stop.\nWe’ve gotta hurry and figure out what’s going on.
A2_4170_PABUSINESSMAN02_100_1000	Whenever I come to eat here after work, all my\nexhaustion from the day just melts away.
A2_4170_PABUSINESSMAN02_100_2000	This place feels like a second home to me.
A2_4170_PABUSINESSMAN02_200_1000	This café’s delicious food is the best possible remedy\nafter a tiring day.
A2_4180_PKBUSINESSWOMAN01_100_1000	I keep coming back to this café every day to get more\nof their coffee.
A2_4180_PKBUSINESSWOMAN01_100_2000	That rich flavor is simply the best!
A2_4180_PKBUSINESSWOMAN01_200_1000	I wish I could have coffee this good at home, too.\nMaybe I’ll ask Pablo to teach me his techniques!
A2_4190_PCWOMAN02_100_1000	I liked this place so much yesterday, I couldn’t resist\ncoming back.
A2_4190_PCWOMAN02_100_2000	Just watching Ludicolo warms my heart...
A2_4190_PCWOMAN02_200_1000	Ludicolo is just so cute...
A2_4200_TIM_100_1000	Thanks for your help earlier. Do you mind if I ask\nsome more questions?
A2_4200_PHWOMAN01_100_1000	About my Inteleon?
A2_4200_TIM_100_2000	No, this is about something else.
A2_4200_PHWOMAN01_200_1000	Can I help you?
A2_4200_SEL_0_1000	After we talked...
A2_4200_SEL_0_2000	About Brad...
A2_4200_TIM_300_1000	Did anything strange happen today after we talked?
A2_4200_RACHEL_300_1000	Inteleon hasn’t come back yet, has he?
A2_4200_PHWOMAN01_300_1000	No, he hasn’t. I think he’s still at the police station.
A2_4200_PHWOMAN01_300_2000	The shop sure is lonely without Inteleon.
A2_4200_PHWOMAN01_300_3000	It’s hard to tell for sure, but I think even the flowers\nare drooping a bit.
A2_4200_PHWOMAN01_300_4000	Inteleon always took such good care of them...
A2_4200_TIM_300_2000	I really hope he can come home soon.
A2_4200_TIM_400_1000	Do you know a man named Brad McMaster who\nworks for the Ryme City Police?
A2_4200_TIM_400_1500	He’s tall and typically wears a blue suit.
A2_4200_PHWOMAN01_400_1000	Oh, yes. The lieutenant just left, in fact.
A2_4200_TIM_400_2000	Really! Do you know what he was doing here?
A2_4200_PHWOMAN01_400_2000	The same thing as you, actually—<color=#F39800FF>investigating the\nflower display Inteleon was accused of vandalizing</color>.
A2_4200_PHWOMAN01_400_3000	I couldn’t make out what, but he was muttering to\nhimself the whole time...
A2_4200_RACHEL_400_1000	Just like at Fountain Plaza! Brad sure spends a lot of\ntime returning to the scene of the crime...
A2_4200_TIM_400_3000	But why is he investigating these crime scenes AFTER\nthe Pokémon have already been detained?
A2_4200_TIM_400_4000	It really makes me wonder...
A2_4210_TIM_100_1000	Thanks for your help earlier. Do you mind if I ask\nsome more questions?
A2_4210_PKMAN01_100_1000	About my Morpeko? I’ve already told you everything\nI know.
A2_4210_TIM_100_2000	No, this is about something else.
A2_4210_PKMAN01_200_1000	What is it?
A2_4210_SEL_0_1000	After we talked...
A2_4210_SEL_0_2000	About Brad...
A2_4210_TIM_300_1000	Did anything strange happen today after we talked?
A2_4210_PKMAN01_300_1000	Hmm, not really...
A2_4210_PKMAN01_300_2000	I was so shocked after they took Morpeko from me\nthat I couldn’t find the motivation to do anything else\nwith my day.
A2_4210_RACHEL_300_1000	Did you try going to the police station? You might be\nable to visit Morpeko there.
A2_4210_PKMAN01_300_3000	Oh, that thought never even occurred to me! I’ll try\nvisiting tomorrow.
A2_4210_TIM_400_1000	Do you know a man named Brad McMaster who\nworks for the Ryme City Police?
A2_4210_TIM_400_2000	He’s tall and typically wears a blue suit.
A2_4210_PKMAN01_400_1000	Yeah, I just met him! He came to ask me some\nquestions.
A2_4210_TIM_400_3000	Oh, really? About what?
A2_4210_PKMAN01_400_2000	<color=#F39800FF>The lieutenant asked me for details on Morpeko’s\nAbility.</color>
A2_4210_PKMAN01_400_3000	So I explained how Morpeko’s appearance and the\ntyping of his Aura Wheel move changes depending on\nwhether he’s hungry or full.
A2_4210_RACHEL_400_1000	Maybe Brad came to the same conclusion we\ndid, Tim.
A2_4210_RACHEL_400_2000	It doesn’t make sense for Morpeko’s Aura Wheel to\nhave been Electric type if he was hungry when he\nused it.
A2_4210_TIM_400_4000	If that’s true, then what exactly is Brad trying to do...?
A2_4220_PHWOMANOLD01_100_1000	Oh, hello there. Do you need something?
A2_4220_TIM_100_1000	I was just hoping to ask you some questions.
A2_4220_PHWOMANOLD01_100_2000	You’ll have to speak up, young man. My ears aren’t\nwhat they used to be.
A2_4220_PHWOMANOLD01_200_1000	Did you need something?
A2_4240_YESSAN_100_1000	Indee?
A2_4240_RACHEL_100_1000	Oh, an Indeedee. These Pokémon can read the\nemotions of those around them.
A2_4240_RACHEL_100_2000	And they’re really kind, too—Indeedee always try to\nhelp out when someone’s in trouble.
A2_4240_TIM_100_1000	You said you wish you could understand the hearts\nand minds of Pokémon too, right?
A2_4240_RACHEL_100_3000	Yeah, I hope someday I can be more like Indeedee.
A2_4250_YESSAN_100_1000	Indeee?
A2_4260_TIM_100_1000	The statue’s still broken. I guess it’ll be a while before\nit gets fixed.
A2_4260_RACHEL_100_1000	I know it’s just a statue, but it kinda makes me feel\nsorry for the Slowpoke.
A2_4270_TIM_100_1000	Thanks for your help earlier. Mind if I ask some more\nquestions?
A2_4270_PHMAN02_100_1000	Are you here to ask about my Impidimp again?
A2_4270_TIM_100_2000	No, this time it’s about something else.
A2_4270_PHMAN02_200_1000	What do you need?
A2_4270_SEL_0_1000	After we talked...
A2_4270_SEL_0_2000	About Brad...
A2_4270_TIM_300_1000	Did anything strange happen today after we talked?
A2_4270_PHMAN02_300_1000	No, that was it. And Impidimp still hasn’t come back.
A2_4270_PHMAN02_300_2000	I wonder what the poor little guy’s doing in the police\nstation right now...
A2_4270_RACHEL_300_1000	Yeah, me too. He could be lonely in there.
A2_4270_PHMAN02_300_3000	I’m more worried that he’s getting up to his usual\npranks and causing trouble for the police!
A2_4270_PHMAN02_300_4000	He’s always got so much excess energy to burn! I can\nonly hope he behaves himself and gets let out soon.
A2_4270_TIM_400_1000	Do you know a man named Brad McMaster who\nworks for the Ryme City Police?
A2_4270_TIM_400_2000	He’s tall and typically wears a blue suit.
A2_4270_PHMAN02_400_1000	Oh, he just came to see me earlier! <color=#F39800FF>He asked me to\ntell him about Impidimp.</color>
A2_4270_PHMAN02_400_2000	So I told him...well, everything.
A2_4270_PHMAN02_400_3000	How much Impidimp loves playing pranks, his\nfondness for shiny things...stuff like that.
A2_4270_PHMAN02_400_4000	The lieutenant was a really good listener. He took it\nall very seriously.
A2_4270_PHMAN02_400_5000	But I never figured out exactly why he was asking me\nall that.
A2_4270_TIM_400_3000	I see. Thanks again for your help.
A2_4270_RACHEL_400_1000	So Brad was asking about an Impidimp who’d already\nbeen detained.
A2_4270_TIM_400_4000	Just what is Brad up to...?
A2_4280_TIM_100_1000	Good evening. May I ask you some questions?
A2_4280_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	Hm? Is something the matter?
A2_4280_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_200_1000	Is something the matter?
A2_4280_SEL_0_1000	About the situation in the city...
A2_4280_SEL_0_2000	About Brad...
A2_4280_SEL_0_3000	About the cube-shaped device...
A2_4280_TIM_300_1000	Did anything unusual happen in the city today?
A2_4280_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_300_1000	What do you mean by “unusual”? I mean, we respond\nto incidents every day.
A2_4280_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_300_2000	And with so many Pokémon-related incidents lately,\nit feels like things are anything BUT usual.
A2_4280_RACHEL_300_1000	Sounds like a lot to deal with...
A2_4280_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_300_3000	It may be a lot, but it’s my job. All I can do is keep\ndoing my best.
A2_4280_TIM_400_1000	Do you happen to know Lieutenant McMaster?
A2_4280_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_400_1000	Of course. We work together on a regular basis.
A2_4280_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_400_2000	He excels at performing his duty.
A2_4280_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_400_3000	His investigations are so thorough and efficient that\nPokémon are detained almost as fast as the case\nitself is opened.
A2_4280_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_400_4000	<color=#F39800FF>In fact, Lieutenant McMaster has the highest crime\nclearance rate in the entire department.</color>
A2_4280_RACHEL_400_1000	Wow, I didn’t realize Brad was so highly regarded!
A2_4280_TIM_500_1000	Is it true that you use cube-shaped devices when\nyou’re detaining Pokémon?
A2_4280_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_500_1000	Oh yeah, those things. We’ve got orders from the PPB\nto attach them to Pokémon.
A2_4280_TIM_500_2000	How do the devices function?
A2_4280_PAPOLICEWOMAN01_500_2000	Who knows? They never really gave us any details.
A2_4290_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	If danger rears its head, you can trust the Ryme City\nPolice to protect and serve!
A2_4290_TIM_100_1000	Excuse me. I was hoping to ask you about something.
A2_4290_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_200_1000	Oh, is something troubling you again?
A2_4290_SEL_0_1000	About the situation in the city...
A2_4290_SEL_0_2000	About Brad...
A2_4290_SEL_0_3000	About the cube-shaped device...
A2_4290_TIM_300_1000	Did anything unusual happen in the city today?
A2_4290_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_300_1000	Hmm... Well, there were a number of incidents...
A2_4290_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_300_2000	Would you like me to tell you about each one?\nListing them all could take a while.
A2_4290_TIM_300_2000	No, I don’t need that much detail. I’m just looking for\nmore general information.
A2_4290_RACHEL_300_1000	Sorry to trouble you—it sounds like your department\nis really busy.
A2_4290_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_300_3000	Oh, it’s no trouble at all! Anything to protect the\npeace of our fine city!
A2_4290_TIM_400_1000	Do you happen to know Lieutenant McMaster?
A2_4290_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_400_1000	Yes, of course. The lieutenant’s really been throwing\nhimself into his work lately!
A2_4290_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_400_2000	The one weird thing I’ve noticed, though, is that\nrecently he’s been going out and working on his own.
A2_4290_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_400_3000	<color=#F39800FF>And at the scenes of crimes that have already been\nsolved</color>, at that!
A2_4290_TIM_400_2000	Why would he be doing that?
A2_4290_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_400_4000	Hmm... I really couldn’t tell you!
A2_4290_TIM_500_1000	Is it true that you use cube-shaped devices when\nyou’re detaining Pokémon?
A2_4290_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_500_1000	Ah, you must mean the management tags.
A2_4290_TIM_500_2000	What makes a “management” tag different from any\nother tag?
A2_4290_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_500_2000	I’m...really not sure. I think they’re really high-tech\nor something!
A2_4290_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_500_3000	I mean, they’re machines, after all! They’ve probably\ngot little computers inside or something!
A2_4290_TIM_500_3000	Do you know anything specific about their function?
A2_4290_PHPOLICEWOMAN01_500_4000	Well, I’m ashamed to say, but not really... I think the\nhigher-ups in the PPB know how they work, though.
A2_4300_TIM_100_1000	I don’t think there’s any point in going this way.
A2_4320_PXWOMANMID01_100_1000	I called the police, so I’m sure they’ll do something\nabout it soon.
A2_4320_PAWOMANMID03_100_1000	I hope the police can take care of this quickly.
A2_4340_PXWOMANMID01_100_1000	Oh, you two! You shouldn’t go this way.\nIt’s dangerous.
A2_4340_TIM_100_1000	Did something happen?
A2_4340_PXWOMANMID01_100_2000	There’s an angry Pokémon back there. We should\nprobably leave it alone for a while.
A2_4340_RACHEL_100_1000	What do you think, Tim? It sounds like a police officer\ncame this way.
A2_4340_TIM_100_2000	I think Brad must have gone this way, and so should\nwe. Just keep an eye out for that angry Pokémon.
A2_4350_BRAD_100_1000	Now then, we’re going to have to detain this\nPokémon properly...
A2_4350_TIM_100_1000	It’s Brad!
A2_4350_RACHEL_100_1000	And it sounds like he’s just about to detain a\nPokémon!
A2_4370_RACHEL_100_1000	It’s a Mightyena! Wait, Tim, isn’t that...?
A2_4370_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, it’s the Pokémon Pikachu asked me to check up\non: Luxray’s friend.
A2_4370_BRAD_100_1000	Well, well, if it isn’t our “Great Detective.” You’re\nwelcome to observe, but don’t get in our way.
A2_4370_BRAD_100_2000	This Mightyena is preventing the residents from\npassing through.
A2_4370_BRAD_100_3000	Not only that—this same Mightyena was previously\ninvolved in an altercation with a Luxray.
A2_4370_BRAD_100_4000	This Pokémon poses a clear threat to the public.
A2_4370_BRAD_100_5000	I’m afraid we’ll have to detain it until we can calm\nit down.
A2_4370_RACHEL_100_2000	Wait, Brad!
A2_4370_BRAD_100_6000	And you are...? Wait—you’re the mayor’s daughter,\naren’t you?
A2_4370_RACHEL_100_3000	Yes, I’m Howard’s daughter, Rachel.
A2_4370_RACHEL_100_4000	Just look at this Mightyena, Brad. The poor thing\nis injured.
A2_4370_GRAENA_100_1000	Eeena...
A2_4370_RACHEL_100_5000	Please, at least treat its wounds before you take it in!\nDon’t you feel sorry for Mightyena?
A2_4370_BRAD_100_7000	I’ll make sure it receives treatment after I’ve taken it\nto the station. Will that satisfy you?
A2_4370_RACHEL_100_6000	No, it won’t! We’ll treat Mightyena ourselves, then!
A2_4370_BRAD_100_8000	Who, you two? My my! Who knew you were\nso talented.
A2_4370_RACHEL_100_7000	Tim! Let’s get help from a Pokémon!
A2_4370_TIM_100_2000	Are we even sure there’s a Pokémon that CAN help?
A2_4370_RACHEL_100_8000	We’ll go find one right now! I’m sure there’s one in the\ncity somewhere...
A2_4370_RACHEL_100_9000	Maybe we can find a Chansey, or an Audino, or\nan Indeedee or something...
A2_4370_TIM_100_3000	OK. Let’s have a look around the city!
A2_4380_BRAD_100_1000	Keep your distance—it’s dangerous.
A2_4400_YESSAN_100_1000	Indee?
A2_4400_RACHEL_100_1000	Look, Tim! Indeedee!
A2_4400_PHWOMANOLD01_100_1000	Hey, you two! What do you think you’re doing?
A2_4400_TIM_100_1000	A Pokémon is hurt. Please, we need Indeedee’s help!
A2_4400_PHWOMANOLD01_100_2000	Ah... Is that so.
A2_4400_PHWOMANOLD01_100_3000	Very well. We should always help one another in times\nof need.
A2_4400_PHWOMANOLD01_100_4000	Go with them, Indeedee! You can help them out!
A2_4400_YESSAN_100_2000	Indeed!
A2_4400_RACHEL_100_2000	Thank you so much! This way, Indeedee!
A2_4410_TIM_100_1000	Excuse me, ma’am! Are you Indeedee’s partner?
A2_4410_PHWOMANOLD01_100_1000	Yes, but what in the world is this all about?
A2_4410_RACHEL_100_1000	A Pokémon is injured. Please, we need Indeedee’s\nhelp!
A2_4410_PHWOMANOLD01_100_2000	Ah... Is that so.
A2_4410_PHWOMANOLD01_100_3000	Very well. We should always help one another in times\nof need.
A2_4410_PHWOMANOLD01_100_4000	Go with them, Indeedee! You can help them out!
A2_4410_YESSAN_100_1000	Indeed!
A2_4410_RACHEL_100_2000	Thank you so much! This way, Indeedee!
A2_4430_BRAD_100_1000	It appears that Mightyena has recovered nicely. Not\nfully, but it’s at least stable for now.
A2_4430_BRAD_100_2000	Now, I trust this is enough to put your mind at ease,\nRachel?
A2_4430_RACHEL_100_1000	I appreciate you waiting for us to get it treated.
A2_4430_TIM_100_1000	There’s something I’d like to talk to you about, Brad.\nBefore you take Mightyena away.
A2_4430_BRAD_100_3000	And what’s that, “Great Detective”?
A2_4430_TIM_100_2000	There’s something off about all these Pokémon\ndetainments the police have been doing.
A2_4430_TIM_100_3000	Every single incident was caught by the surveillance\ncameras. That’s too convenient to be natural.
A2_4430_BRAD_100_4000	... ... ...
A2_4430_TIM_100_4000	Surely you’ve noticed, Brad?
A2_4430_TIM_100_5000	Innocent Pokémon are being framed!
A2_4430_TIM_100_6000	That’s what happened to my Pikachu, and he can’t be\nthe only one...
A2_4430_BRAD_100_5000	So you’re suspicious of the surveillance cameras...
A2_4430_BRAD_100_10000	But the footage on those cameras is incriminating\nevidence.
A2_4430_BRAD_100_11000	Unless, “Great Detective,” you’ve found evidence that\nPokémon are being framed?
A2_4430_TIM_100_7000	No...not yet.
A2_4430_BRAD_100_12000	In that case, I have no choice but to take this\nMightyena into custody. It’s my duty.
A2_4430_BRAD_100_13000	...Take it away.
A2_4430_PKPOLICEWOMAN01_100_1000	Yes, sir! Detaining the Mightyena now, sir!
A2_4430_RACHEL_100_2000	I hope Mightyena’s OK...
A2_4430_TIM_100_8000	It’ll be with Pikachu and the others at the station. I’m\nsure it’ll be fine.
A2_4430_TIM_100_9000	This is all just so frustrating...
A2_4430_TIM_100_10000	We couldn’t even stop Brad!
A2_4430_TIM_100_11000	If we just had some proof! We have to find some...\nWe NEED to find some!
A2_4440_PXWOMANMID01_100_1000	Oh, thank goodness. I’m glad that Mightyena finally\ncalmed down.
A2_4440_PAWOMANMID03_100_1000	Now we can finally get through here safely.
A2_4440_RACHEL_100_1000	Hey, Tim—I bet we could talk to these people right\nnow.
A2_4440_TIM_100_1000	You’re right. Let’s see what they have to say.
A2_4450_PXWOMANMID01_100_1000	Thank you for calming that Mightyena just now. You\nreally did us a favor.
A2_4450_RACHEL_100_1000	Oh, we actually didn’t do much...
A2_4450_TIM_100_1000	Do you mind if we ask you some questions?
A2_4450_PAWOMANMID03_100_1000	Oh, what did you need?
A2_4450_PAWOMANMID03_200_1000	Did you still need something?
A2_4450_SEL_0_1000	About the cube-shaped device...
A2_4450_SEL_0_2000	About Brad...
A2_4450_TIM_300_1000	Do you know anything about the cube-shaped\ndevices that are used when Pokémon are detained?
A2_4450_PXWOMANMID01_300_1000	You mean those things they stick to their backs?
A2_4450_PAWOMANMID03_300_1000	<color=#F39800FF>The way they glow, they’re pretty hard to miss.</color>
A2_4450_RACHEL_300_1000	Glowing backs, huh? Kinda reminds me of Volbeat\nor Illumise.
A2_4450_PXWOMANMID01_300_2000	Oh, and the Pokémon seemed to really dislike\nthose devices.
A2_4450_TIM_300_2000	How could you tell?
A2_4450_PXWOMANMID01_300_3000	<color=#F39800FF>I saw a Pokémon struggling and flailing its limbs.</color>
A2_4450_TIM_400_1000	Do you know anything about Brad McMaster? He’s\nthe police lieutenant who was just here.
A2_4450_PXWOMANMID01_400_1000	Hmm... Not really, but he certainly was easy on\nthe eyes!
A2_4450_PAWOMANMID03_400_1000	Yeah, he gives “Ryme City’s finest” a whole new\nmeaning!
A2_4450_TIM_400_2000	Uh, yeah... OK...
A2_4450_RACHEL_400_1000	I don’t think we’re going to learn anything useful\nabout Brad from these two.
A2_4455_RACHEL_100_1000	What should we do now, Tim?
A2_4455_RACHEL_100_2000	I doubt we’ll be able to speak with Brad directly any\nmore today.
A2_4455_TIM_100_1000	Let’s talk to some other people. Lucky for us, there\nstill seem to be a bunch of people out and about.
A2_4455_RACHEL_100_3000	I hope we can learn more about Brad and those\ncube-shaped devices.
A2_4460_PHWOMANOLD01_100_1000	Has that injured Pokémon gotten any better?
A2_4460_TIM_100_1000	Yes. It’s recovering quickly, thanks to Indeedee!
A2_4460_RACHEL_100_1000	Thank you so much!
A2_4460_PHWOMANOLD01_100_2000	You’re very welcome! Remember, helping each other\nout in times of need is the secret to a long life!
A2_4460_PHWOMANOLD01_200_1000	Indeedee is a kindhearted Pokémon. Helping others\nmeans the world to her.
A2_4470_TIM_100_1000	Thank you for your help earlier, Indeedee.
A2_4470_RACHEL_100_1000	Mightyena’s doing much better, and it’s all thanks\nto you.
A2_4470_YESSAN_100_1000	Indeed!
A2_4470_YESSAN_200_1000	Indeed!
A2_4480_TIM_100_1000	Now we know Brad isn’t the culprit—and we got that\ntip about Ditto too.
A2_4480_TIM_100_2000	We should tell Pikachu as soon as we can.
A2_4480_RACHEL_100_1000	At night? Would they even let us see him?
A2_4480_TIM_100_3000	The officer at the reception desk said that we could\nvisit up to twice a day.
A2_4480_TIM_100_4000	As long as the station’s open, I think it’ll be fine.
A2_4490_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_1000	Would you like to visit Pikachu now?
A2_4490_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_4490_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_4490_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_300_1000	Then follow me.
A2_4490_TIM_400_1000	Sorry, there’s something I need to do first. I’ll be\nright back.
A2_4610_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m in...the detainment room? Great. Back again with\nmissing memories.
A2_4610_PIKACHU_100_2000	A mystery for another time—right now, my goal is the\nchief’s office on the second floor.
A2_4610_PIKACHU_100_3000	There was a duct in his office, but it doesn’t seem to\nbe connected to the ones down here in detainment...
A2_4610_PIKACHU_100_4000	I’ll have to go up to the first floor and search for a\nduct that connects to the chief’s office.
A2_4610_PIKACHU_100_5000	I guess I’ll go see Luxray first, though.
A2_4610_PIKACHU_100_6000	I can look for a duct leading to the chief’s office\nafter that.
A2_4620_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(Are you heading out to explore the station again?)
A2_4620_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. We found a room that looks important, so I’m\ngonna rustle up some clues!
A2_4620_YAMIRAMI_100_2000	(Well, considering you passed my treasure hunt test\nwith flying colors...)
A2_4620_YAMIRAMI_100_3000	(I bet you’ll come back with something amazing to\nshare with us!)
A2_4620_YAMIRAMI_200_1000	(Good luck out there!)
A2_4630_GORONDA_100_1000	(You’ve kept me waiting. How’s the investigation\ngoing?)
A2_4630_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s going. And relax—this is one great detective you\ncan count on!
A2_4630_GORONDA_100_2000	(“Great detective”? I swear I’ve heard that\nsomewhere...)
A2_4630_GORONDA_200_1000	(“Great detective...” Where have I heard that\nbefore?)
A2_4640_RENTORAR_100_1000	(What is it? Do you need my help again?)
A2_4640_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thanks for the offer, but you wouldn’t be able to get\nthrough the ducts.
A2_4640_PIKACHU_100_2000	My plan is to take ’em up to the first floor and aim for\nthe chief’s office.
A2_4640_RENTORAR_100_2000	(Then I suppose I’ll just have to leave that to you.)
A2_4640_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yep. You can count on me!
A2_4640_PIKACHU_100_4000	...Oh yeah. When I talked to Tim earlier, I passed on\nyour message about Mightyena.
A2_4640_RENTORAR_100_3000	(Ah. Thank you...)
A2_4640_PIKACHU_100_5000	Hey, no sweat! Now just hang tight until our next visit,\nand I’ll fill you in on his report!
A2_4640_RENTORAR_200_1000	(What’s in that “chief’s office” you mentioned?\nGo find out and let me know.)
A2_4650_BEROBA_100_1000	(When are we gonna get outta here?)
A2_4650_PIKACHU_100_1000	That depends on what info I can find. I’m heading out\nright after this!
A2_4650_BEROBA_100_2000	(I’m dyin’ to see my partner, so you better pull\nthrough!)
A2_4650_BEROBA_200_1000	(I’m dyin’ to see my partner, so you better pull\nthrough!)
A2_4660_LEPARDAS_100_1000	(You’re going out investigating again, are you not?)
A2_4660_LEPARDAS_100_2000	(If I could only fit through those ducts, I’m certain I’d\nbe able to help you too...)
A2_4660_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thanks. It’s the thought that counts.
A2_4660_LEPARDAS_200_1000	(Be careful not to let the police officers see you.)
A2_4670_DEDENNE_100_1000	(When the heck are we gettin’ outta here?!)
A2_4670_PIKACHU_100_1000	Can’t make any promises yet, but I did spot a place\nthat looks worth investigating.
A2_4670_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’m gonna scope out the chief’s office and report\nback, so hang tight, OK?
A2_4670_DEDENNE_200_1000	(Hurry up already! I wanna go home!)
A2_4680_YOKUBARISU_100_1000	(Hmm. Guess when you’re indoors, the fallen Berry\npickings are slim...)
A2_4680_YOKUBARISU_100_2000	(The sooner I get outside, the sooner I can eat lots of\nBerries!)
A2_4680_PIKACHU_100_1000	I feel that. I’ve been missing Pablo’s coffee myself...
A2_4680_YOKUBARISU_200_1000	(The sooner I get outside, the sooner I can eat lots of\nBerries!)
A2_4690_MIRUHOG_100_1000	(This cube-shaped thingy on my back is such a\nnuisance! Doesn’t it bug you too, Pikachu?)
A2_4690_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’ve mostly gotten used to it, but yeah, I agree that it’s\nnot ideal.
A2_4690_MIRUHOG_100_2000	(Not at all... Ugh, it’s driving me CRAZY!)
A2_4690_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hey, calm down, Watchog! I’m gonna go do some\ninvestigating to get us out of here.
A2_4690_MIRUHOG_200_1000	(Please find us a way out, Pikachu.)
A2_4700_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_100_1000	(*gurgle* Guhhh, I’m running on fumes...)
A2_4700_PIKACHU_100_1000	What’s wrong, Morpeko? Didn’t the police feed you?
A2_4700_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_100_2000	(Not enough! Argh! I’m so hungry I got no energy\nat all!)
A2_4700_PIKACHU_100_2000	Maybe it’s ’cause you’re shut in here. I gotta find a\nway to get us all out.
A2_4700_MORPEKOHARAPEKO_200_1000	(Arrrgh! I’m so hungry I got no energy at all!)
A2_4710_INTEREON_100_1000	(Is it daytime? Or night? I can’t say I’m fond of being\ncut off from seeing the world outside.)
A2_4710_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, I feel ya. The only time they let us get some\nfresh air is for a few lousy minutes of exercise.
A2_4710_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’ll keep investigating so I can get us outta here ASAP.
A2_4710_INTEREON_200_1000	(I’m depending on you, Pikachu.)
A2_4720_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, now I’m on the first floor, but there are lots of\npolice officers up here.
A2_4720_PIKACHU_100_2000	If they spot me, I’ll get thrown right back into the\ndetainment room...
A2_4720_PIKACHU_100_3000	Anyway, where should I go?
A2_4727_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like there’s a duct way back there.
A2_4727_PIKACHU_100_2000	Based on the floor plan, I’m guessing that duct should\nconnect to the chief’s office.
A2_4727_PIKACHU_100_3000	Guess there’s no point in standing around—muscles,\ndon’t fail me now!
A2_4770_PIKACHU_100_1000	Argh... One more time!
A2_4790_PIKACHU_100_1000	All right! I made it to the duct!
A2_4790_PIKACHU_100_2000	Guess I’ve gotta climb up there. I just hope it really\ndoes connect to the chief's office!
A2_4800_PIKACHU_100_1000	Finally outta there...
A2_4800_PIKACHU_100_2000	This has gotta be the chief’s office! Just look at it!
A2_4800_PIKACHU_100_3000	Looks like my little stealth mission was a success—as\nexpected! Now let’s find out what you’re REALLY up\nto, Butler...
A2_4805_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s one sturdy-looking safe. I’m gonna need to get\nmy paws on a passcode if I wanna see what’s inside.
A2_4805_PIKACHU_100_2000	I wonder how I can find that code...
A2_4820_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, you’re that Ditto we’ve been hearing about,\naren’t you? Is this where you’ve been?
A2_4820_METAMON_100_1000	(Wow, it’s a Pikachu! You know about me?)
A2_4820_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh yeah, I know aaallll about you. Matter of fact, I\ngot some questions for ya.
A2_4820_METAMON_200_1000	(You wanna talk some more?)
A2_4820_SEL_0_1000	Why are you here?
A2_4820_SEL_0_2000	About you and Butler...
A2_4820_SEL_0_3000	About the safe...
A2_4820_SEL_0_4000	About the passcode to the safe...
A2_4820_PIKACHU_300_1000	What are you even doing here, Ditto?
A2_4820_METAMON_300_1000	(I’ve been here for ages, using Transform to turn into\nall kinds of Pokémon!)
A2_4820_METAMON_300_2000	(Mr. Man always asks me to do it here in this room.\nHe says, “Transform into this Pokémon!”)
A2_4820_METAMON_300_3000	(But after I use Transform, my head goes all fuzzy.)
A2_4820_METAMON_300_4000	(So I don’t really remember what happens after that.)
A2_4820_PIKACHU_300_2000	You’ve been experiencing memory loss too, eh, Ditto?\nI know just how you—hey, wait a minute...
A2_4820_PIKACHU_300_3000	Did Ditto make itself look like me and break that\nSlowpoke statue while its memories were missing?
A2_4820_PIKACHU_400_1000	Was someone in this room earlier? A guy called\nButler?
A2_4820_METAMON_400_1000	(Yep, Mr. Man’s here all the time—not right now,\nthough.)
A2_4820_PIKACHU_400_2000	You’re not Butler’s partner though, are you?
A2_4820_METAMON_400_2000	(Partner? No, my best friend is Granny!)
A2_4820_METAMON_400_3000	(Mr. Man is the person who brought me here.)
A2_4820_METAMON_400_4000	(He’s really nice!)
A2_4820_PIKACHU_400_2500	Butler? “Nice”? With a mean mug like THAT?!
A2_4820_METAMON_400_5000	(He gives me lotsa compliments when I use\nTransform!)
A2_4820_PIKACHU_400_3000	Hey Ditto... You haven’t seen your “Granny” in a\nwhile, have you?
A2_4820_METAMON_400_6000	(Nope, nuh-uh.)
A2_4820_METAMON_400_7000	(Will I get to see her if I keep waiting in this room?)
A2_4820_PIKACHU_400_4000	I’m afraid not, Ditto. Wait as long as you like—she\nwon’t be showing up here anytime soon.
A2_4820_METAMON_400_8000	(Huh?! Really?!)
A2_4820_PIKACHU_400_5000	This poor Ditto’s just another victim...
A2_4820_PIKACHU_500_1000	There’s a safe in this room. Y’know, that big box?
A2_4820_METAMON_500_1000	(Yep, it’s right over there!)
A2_4820_PIKACHU_500_2000	Do you know what’s inside?
A2_4820_METAMON_500_2000	(I saw Mr. Man move papers in and outta that box\nlotsa times!)
A2_4820_METAMON_500_3000	(He sings a weird song whenever he opens or closes\nthe box.)
A2_4820_PIKACHU_500_3000	A song?
A2_4820_METAMON_500_4000	(Yeah! “Hmm-hmm! Fife-wun-fife... Hmm-hmm!\nOh-too-oh!” ♪)
A2_4820_METAMON_500_5000	(That’s what Mr. Man sings when he opens the box!)
A2_4820_PIKACHU_500_4000	“Fife-wun-fife, oh-too-oh... ♪” Like that?
A2_4820_METAMON_500_6000	(Yeah, just like that! You’re a real good singer!\nFife-wun-fife, oh-too-oh, hmm-hmm-hmm! ♪)
A2_4820_PIKACHU_500_5000	Got it, thanks. Sounds to me like a six-digit number...
A2_4820_PIKACHU_600_1000	Hey, can you sing that song for me again? The one\nButler sings when he’s opening the safe?
A2_4820_METAMON_600_1000	(Yeah, sure! “Fife-won-fife, oh-too-oh...\nHmm-hmm!” ♪)
A2_4820_PIKACHU_600_2000	OK, so it’s 515020. Got it. Thanks, Ditto!
A2_4830_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thanks for tellin’ me all that stuff.
A2_4830_PIKACHU_100_2000	By the way, Ditto, do you mind turning around for\na sec?
A2_4830_METAMON_100_1000	(Huh? What is it? Do I have something on me?)
A2_4830_PIKACHU_100_3000	Sorry about this... Nnngh...
A2_4830_PIKACHU_100_4000	Urk... I feel like I’ve almost...got it...
A2_4830_PIKACHU_100_4500	I guess I’m not strong enough to pull the device off.
A2_4830_PIKACHU_100_5000	I thought I might be able to remove it and stop Ditto\nfrom doing any more bad things...
A2_4830_METAMON_100_2000	(Huh? What? Didja say something?)
A2_4830_PIKACHU_100_6000	Oh, uh, nope! Nothin’ at all.
A2_4840_PIKACHU_100_1000	Here’s Butler’s safe...
A2_4840_PIKACHU_100_2000	And that “song” Ditto told me about must be the\npasscode.
A2_4840_PIKACHU_100_3000	OK! Time to crack it open and see what’s inside!
A2_4860_PIKACHU_100_1000	All right! It worked!
A2_4860_PIKACHU_100_2000	Lemme see what we got in here... A packet of papers\nand some photos.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_100_3000	I just hope this info helps get us outta here!
A2_4860_SEL_0_1000	Instruction manual
A2_4860_SEL_0_2000	Orders
A2_4860_SEL_0_3000	Butler’s report
A2_4860_SEL_0_4000	Damage reports
A2_4860_PIKACHU_300_1000	The cover of this instruction manual has diagrams of\nthose cube-shaped devices.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_300_2000	Guess that means it’s got details on how to use ’em.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_300_3000	Hmm... So these things are called “Control Cubes.”
A2_4860_PIKACHU_300_4000	It says there are special controllers to operate the\ncubes remotely.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_300_5000	They must’ve used those controllers to make us walk\nup to the roof.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_300_6000	Sheesh... That’s not totally disturbing or anything.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_1000	Looks like paperwork sent to Butler from some sort of\norganization.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_2000	And the organization’s name is...Unitas.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_3000	Hm? Wait a sec—these are orders TO Butler!
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_4000	What sort of organization can order around the chief\nof the Pokémon Protection Bureau?!
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_5000	Just who are these Unitas people?
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_6000	His orders are to capture Pokémon...and transfer\nthem.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_7000	Looks like this has been ongoing for six months\nalready, but the numbers shot up in the last month.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_8000	And it was all going on right under my nose. I really\ndropped the ball...
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_9000	Hm? What’s this about “compensation”?
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_10000	These numbers show how much Unitas has been\npaying Butler...
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_11000	And the payments are for sending the captured\nPokémon being kept at this station to some other\nlocation.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_12000	These are photos of their targets...
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_13000	Hey, wait! That’s me!
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_14000	Butler was under orders to capture ME?!
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_15000	But what the heck for?! Nothing here’s giving me any\ninsight into Unitas’s actual goals...
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_16000	Oh, here’s a photo of some humans... Hm? This lady\nlooks awfully familiar...
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_17000	Ohhh, I remember! That’s Jessica!
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_18000	I’m pretty sure we met her in the café the other day.\nWasn’t she friends with Rachel?
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_19000	But why is Jessica circled in red?
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_20000	I’ve gotta let Rachel know about this.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_21000	Huh? Who’s that woman next to Jessica?
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_22000	Say, isn’t that Howard Myers—MAYOR Howard\nMyers?! And next to him...
A2_4860_PIKACHU_400_23000	Hmph. It’s that scientist, Merloch. The guy who\nplucked some of my fur.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_500_1000	Here’s a report Butler wrote to someone.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_500_2000	It goes on at length about how he’s been rounding up\nPokémon with help from the police.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_500_3000	Seems Brad has been particularly active on\nthat front...
A2_4860_PIKACHU_500_4000	Brad’s not gonna be happy when he finds out the\nchief’s been playin’ him like a fiddle.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_500_5000	The report also says that Holiday’s been making a\nnuisance of himself.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_500_6000	Looks like the inspector’s been repeatedly objecting\nto Butler’s methods.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_600_1000	These are forms filled out by the victims of Pokémon-\nrelated incidents.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_600_2000	They contain descriptions by the victims of the\ndamages incurred.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_600_3000	Let’s see... Descriptions of Pokémon stealing things,\nPokémon causing property damage...
A2_4860_PIKACHU_600_4000	Wait...I don’t see a damage report about the incident\nthat occurred at the flower shop.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_600_5000	I thought Inteleon destroyed the flowers there...
A2_4860_PIKACHU_600_6000	I’m not seeing any reports about stolen food, either...
A2_4860_PIKACHU_600_7000	Even though Morpeko was detained for stealing food.
A2_4860_PIKACHU_600_8000	So they’re detaining Pokémon over incidents that\ndon’t even have damage reports?
A2_4870_PIKACHU_100_1000	I wish I could show all of these to Tim...
A2_4870_PIKACHU_100_2000	Pretty sure taking them all is out of the question,\nthough.
A2_4870_PIKACHU_100_3000	I’ll just have to settle with taking the most important-\nlooking pages. Lemme just tear those out...
A2_4870_PIKACHU_100_4000	Guess I can hide these in my hat for now.
A2_4870_PIKACHU_100_5000	Oof! Hat feels a little snug now.
A2_4870_PIKACHU_100_6000	Well, now that I’ve got those documents, I’ll just close\nthe safe so it looks like nobody was here...
A2_4870_METAMON_100_1000	(Why’d ya stuff your hat fulla papers? Are they super\nspecial or somethin’?)
A2_4870_PIKACHU_100_7000	Yeah, Ditto. And thanks to these, you’ll be able to\nsee Granny again!
A2_4870_METAMON_100_2000	(Oooh, really? That makes me so happy! Thank you!)
A2_4870_PIKACHU_100_8000	Yep, so just wait here a little longer. I’ll just take these\npapers back to my room and—
A2_4870_PIKACHU_100_9000	Huh? Is someone there?
A2_4890_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’ve got to tell Tim about what we just heard. Better\ngo prep for our next visit...
A2_5010_RACHEL_100_1000	I’m glad they’re letting us visit even though it’s late.
A2_5010_TIM_100_1000	Yeah. We could’ve come tomorrow if we were turned\naway, but it was nice they let us in.
A2_5010_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, I’m glad you came tonight! There’ve been some\ninteresting developments...
A2_5010_TIM_100_2000	Oh? What’d you find out?
A2_5010_PIKACHU_100_2000	Come a little closer, Tim. I’ll tell you all about it.
A2_5020_RACHEL_100_1000	What did Pikachu say just now?
A2_5020_TIM_100_1000	He said there have been some “interesting\ndevelopments.” I’m not sure if that’s good or bad...
A2_5020_RACHEL_100_2000	Yeah, that’s pretty vague... You’d better go get the\ndetails from him.
A2_5030_RACHEL_100_1000	I wonder what happened with Pikachu...
A2_5040_TIM_100_1000	So what are these “interesting developments” you\nmentioned?
A2_5040_PIKACHU_100_1000	Apparently they’re planning to transfer me to some\nother location tomorrow.
A2_5040_TIM_100_2000	They’re relocating you?! Where—and what for?!
A2_5040_PIKACHU_100_2000	I dunno. But something tells me it’s not an all-inclusive\nbeach resort.
A2_5040_PIKACHU_100_3000	And once I’m there, I doubt we’ll be able to visit\neach other like we have been.
A2_5040_TIM_100_3000	Seriously?! Then what can we do?
A2_5040_PIKACHU_100_4000	Calm down, Tim. Our window of opportunity hasn’t\nclosed just yet.
A2_5040_PIKACHU_100_5000	But first, I gotta ask—did you learn anything\nabout Brad?
A2_5040_TIM_100_4000	Yeah. Brad’s not our culprit.
A2_5040_TIM_100_5000	He’s been independently investigating these incidents,\njust like we are.
A2_5040_PIKACHU_100_6000	OK. In that case, we might be able to get him on our\nside, don’t you think?
A2_5040_PIKACHU_100_7000	With Brad’s help, I’d be able to waltz on outta here\ntomorrow morning.
A2_5040_TIM_100_6000	But that would put Brad in the position of working\nagainst the police.
A2_5040_TIM_100_7000	Do you really think he’d agree to that?
A2_5040_PIKACHU_100_8000	If you want him to, you’ll have to explain what’s really\ngoing on—and you’ll have to do it clearly, with no\nroom for doubt.
A2_5040_PIKACHU_100_9000	Tell him who’s behind all this, and how they did it.
A2_5040_TIM_100_8000	Well, to be honest...I still haven’t figured it all out.\nI don’t think we have enough information yet.
A2_5040_PIKACHU_100_10000	If it’s info you need, I’ve got you covered.
A2_5040_PIKACHU_100_11000	I found some definitive proof in the police station.
A2_5040_PIKACHU_100_12000	Let’s look over the evidence and get deducing.
A2_5040_TIM_100_9000	Wait, Pikachu! Are you sure it’s a good idea to show it\nout in the open? The officer will see!
A2_5040_RACHEL_100_1000	... ... ...
A2_5040_RACHEL_100_2000	Officer, quick! There’s a Pokémon loose in this room!
A2_5040_PHPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	What? I don’t see any Pokémon...
A2_5040_RACHEL_100_3000	Over here, in the corner! Look closely!
A2_5040_PHPOLICEMAN01_100_2000	Huh? Let me see...
A2_5040_PIKACHU_100_13000	Wow, Rachel’s really on it! She distracted the officer\nfor us.
A2_5040_TIM_100_10000	Now’s our chance, Pikachu!
A2_5040_PIKACHU_100_14000	OK, here are some papers I found inside the safe in\nButler’s office.
A2_5040_TIM_100_11000	Thanks. Looks like <color=#F39800FF>an instruction manual for the\ndevices and various incident reports</color>, along with—
A2_5040_PIKACHU_100_15000	There are four sets of documents in total. Read ’em\nclosely and make your own deductions.
A2_5040_PIKACHU_200_1000	I need you to convince Brad.
A2_5050_TIM_100_1000	Thanks for the assist earlier, Rachel.
A2_5050_RACHEL_100_1000	No problem. Not my proudest moment, though...
A2_5050_RACHEL_100_2000	Anyway, what did you get from Pikachu?
A2_5050_TIM_100_2000	He found some paperwork...
A2_5050_RACHEL_100_3000	This photo... It’s Papa and Mama! And Jessica and\nMerloch too?
A2_5050_TIM_100_3000	Yeah, and Jessica’s marked with a circle. It seems like\nshe’s being targeted by an organization called Unitas.
A2_5050_RACHEL_100_4000	I hope Jessica’s OK...but right now, we need to focus\non solving this case.
A2_5050_RACHEL_100_5000	Let’s go see Jessica as soon as we’ve resolved all this!
A2_5050_RACHEL_200_1000	I’m worried about Jessica, but let’s resolve this\nincident with Pikachu first.
A2_5060_PHPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	Can you finish up quickly, please?
A2_5065_PHPOLICEMAN01_100_1000	We weren’t able to find it...
A2_5065_PHPOLICEMAN01_100_2000	Where could that Pokémon have gone? If I don’t find\nit, my boss is gonna give me an earful...
A2_5070_PIKACHU_100_1000	Now we know the truth behind all these “incidents.”
A2_5070_TIM_100_1000	Chief Butler was using some kind of controller to\nmake a Pokémon commit crimes...
A2_5070_PIKACHU_100_2000	Exactly. You need to tell Brad, ASAP!
A2_5070_PIKACHU_100_3000	He’ll probably be shocked, but if you show him proof,\nI think he’ll understand.
A2_5070_PIKACHU_100_4000	Then we can stop Butler from carrying out his plans.
A2_5070_TIM_100_2000	Yeah, I’ll do that. But still...
A2_5070_TIM_100_3000	You’re supposed to be transferred somewhere\ntomorrow, right? Are you sure we’ll make it in time?
A2_5070_PIKACHU_100_5000	Good point... I need to figure out a way to escape.
A2_5090_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’ll need help from the others if I’m gonna bust outta\nthis place.
A2_5090_TIM_100_1000	You said Luxray and the others were helping you,\nright? Are you sure you’ll be OK?
A2_5090_PIKACHU_100_2000	Of course! Just you watch—I’m gonna bust outta\nthis place and take all the others with me! Wish me\nluck, Tim!
A2_5090_TIM_100_2000	Oh, speaking of Luxray...we found that Mightyena.
A2_5090_PIKACHU_100_3000	Really?! How was he?
A2_5090_TIM_100_3000	He was injured. We helped get him back on his feet,\nbut after that, he was detained by the police.
A2_5090_PIKACHU_100_4000	Ah... Well, I’ll tell Luxray. Thanks, Tim.
A2_5090_PIKACHU_100_5000	We’re breaking out of here tomorrow—and like I said,\nI’m bringing the others with me. Mightyena included.
A2_5090_TIM_100_4000	What do you need me to do?
A2_5090_PIKACHU_100_6000	Cause a distraction for the police outside of the\nstation.
A2_5090_TIM_100_5000	Got it. You want to make sure there are as few\nofficers in the station as possible, yeah?
A2_5090_PIKACHU_100_7000	Exactly. That’ll be our chance to escape!
A2_5090_PIKACHU_100_8000	Oh, and don’t forget about Brad!
A2_5210_TIM_100_1000	Do you think Brad will believe us?
A2_5210_RACHEL_100_1000	You’ve got all the information to prove it, right? I’m\nsure that’ll convince him!
A2_5210_TIM_100_2000	Yeah...I guess all we can do is try.
A2_5210_TIM_100_3000	I bet Brad’s still out investigating at one of the crime\nscenes. Let’s go look for him.
A2_5210_RACHEL_100_2000	Brad sure is dedicated.
A2_5220_LIVOLT01_100_1000	Manec?
A2_5220_TIM_100_1000	I see you’re out working late, Manectric. You sure\nare committed!
A2_5230_RACHEL_100_1000	Are you ready to try and convince Brad?
A2_5230_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A2_5230_SEL_0_2000	No
A2_5230_TIM_300_1000	Hi there, Brad. I see you’re here in the plaza again.
A2_5230_BRAD_300_1000	As are you, “Great Detective.” What of it?
A2_5230_TIM_300_2000	What happened with that Mightyena earlier?
A2_5230_BRAD_300_2000	It’s being taken into custody at the police station, just\nlike your Pikachu was.
A2_5230_TIM_300_3000	I see...
A2_5230_BRAD_300_3000	Is that all you wanted to ask?
A2_5230_TIM_300_4000	No, there’s something else—something important.
A2_5230_TIM_400_1000	Wait, there’s something I want to do first.
A2_5230_RACHEL_400_1000	OK. We’ll talk to Brad when you’re ready.
A2_5230_SEL_0_3000	About the PPB...
A2_5230_SEL_0_4000	About the proof...
A2_5230_TIM_600_1000	Brad, what’s your opinion of the Bureau?
A2_5230_BRAD_600_1000	My “opinion”?
A2_5230_TIM_600_2000	Do you think the police and the PPB trust each other\nand work together effectively?
A2_5230_BRAD_600_2000	Why, did you hear something from Inspector Holiday?\nIn any case, it’s...hard to say.
A2_5230_BRAD_600_3000	I’m finding a lot of strange discrepancies with these\nrecent Pokémon incidents.
A2_5230_TIM_600_3000	Too many to chalk up to coincidence, wouldn’t you\nsay? As if someone in the police or the PPB wants it\nthat way.
A2_5230_BRAD_600_4000	Do you have any evidence of that? Without proof, all\nI can do is carry on with my job.
A2_5230_TIM_600_4000	And that’s exactly why you keep returning to the\ncrime scenes, isn’t it—to find proof of who’s behind\nall this?
A2_5230_BRAD_600_5000	Are we done here? Sorry, but I’m very busy. Let’s go,\nManectric!
A2_5230_LIVOLT01_600_1000	Manec!
A2_5230_TIM_600_5000	The PPB is detaining innocent Pokémon.
A2_5230_BRAD_600_6000	Excuse me?
A2_5230_TIM_600_6000	And that’s not all. They’re also planning to transfer\nthose Pokémon being detained at the police station\nsomewhere else!
A2_5230_BRAD_600_7000	What?! That’s a very serious accusation you’re\nmaking—especially if it were true...
A2_5230_TIM_600_7000	I have proof.
A2_5230_BRAD_600_8000	Then show me... Let’s see this “proof” of yours.
A2_5230_TIM_700_1000	Take a look at this. It’s from Chief Butler’s office.
A2_5230_BRAD_700_1000	And why would you have something from his office?
A2_5230_TIM_700_2000	Are you suggesting I stole it? You don’t have any\nevidence of that.
A2_5230_BRAD_700_2000	*sigh* Just...hand it over.
A2_5230_BRAD_700_3000	This can’t be! They’re...controlling Pokémon?
A2_5230_BRAD_700_4000	Of course... So that’s why the Pokémon become so\nobedient once those devices are attached.
A2_5230_TIM_700_3000	... ... ...
A2_5230_BRAD_700_5000	And it all adds up... This list accounts for each and\nevery incident to date.
A2_5230_BRAD_700_6000	So they were all orchestrated by Butler—or rather, by\nthis “Unitas” organization pulling his strings.
A2_5240_TIM_100_1000	So, Brad, do you believe me now?
A2_5240_TIM_100_2000	Pikachu and the other Pokémon are innocent!
A2_5240_BRAD_100_1000	I never thought something like this could happen...
A2_5240_TIM_100_3000	Please, Brad. We need your help.
A2_5240_TIM_100_4000	We just want to help Pikachu and the other Pokémon\nof this city!
A2_5240_BRAD_100_2000	Any other day I would’ve thought this was some kind\nof joke...but the evidence you have is irrefutable.
A2_5240_BRAD_100_3000	Very well, then. I’ll confront Chief Butler about this.
A2_5240_TIM_100_5000	Really? Thank you, Brad!
A2_5240_BRAD_100_4000	There’s no need for you to thank me. I’m just doing\nmy job.
A2_5240_BRAD_100_5000	The duty of the police is to uphold the peace and\nprotect the residents of this city. That will always\ntake priority over orders from the PPB.
A2_5240_BRAD_100_6000	I’ll get started first thing tomorrow.
A2_5240_TIM_100_6000	That might be too late! They plan to transfer Pikachu\naway tomorrow.
A2_5240_BRAD_100_7000	Too late? But any sooner would mean a breach of\nofficial procedure...
A2_5240_TIM_100_7000	Listen, Brad. I’m pretty sure Pikachu’s going to make a\nbreak for it at the station tomorrow morning.
A2_5240_BRAD_100_8000	What do you mean?
A2_5240_TIM_100_8000	We have a plan.
A2_5240_TIM_100_9000	If we can pull it off, Pikachu and all the innocent\nPokémon will escape.
A2_5240_TIM_100_10000	But in order for our plan to work, we need your help.
A2_5240_BRAD_100_9000	Not giving up without a fight, huh? Well...
A2_5240_BRAD_100_10000	What is it you want me to do?
A2_5240_TIM_100_11000	Thank you! Here’s what I had in mind...
A2_5250_PHPOLICEWOMAN02_100_1000	We’re not allowing visitations right now.
A2_5310_PIKACHU_100_1000	Morning already? Time to get this show on the road.
A2_5310_PIKACHU_100_2000	If we don’t do something, I’m gonna be transferred\naway somewhere today.
A2_5310_PIKACHU_100_3000	And all these innocent Pokémon are gonna be stuck\nhere with no way out...
A2_5310_PIKACHU_100_4000	Right then, let’s do this! I’m gonna get us all out!
A2_5330_NOFACEANNOUNCE_100_1000	It’s time for exercise. Proceed to the roof, single file.
A2_5330_GORONDA_100_1000	(... ... ...)
A2_5330_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(... ... ...)
A2_5330_PIKACHU_100_1000	Strange...that announcement’s usually the last thing I\nhear before losing my memories, but now, I’m the only\none here that seems unaffected?
A2_5330_PIKACHU_100_2000	Must be ’cause I got rid of that cube.
A2_5330_PIKACHU_100_3000	For now, I guess I’ll go up to the roof with the others\nand let Luxray and folks know about the escape.
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey! Everyone! You wanna get out of this police\nstation, don’t ya?
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_2000	None of you actually did those bad things they\narrested you for!
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_3000	We were set up by a few rotten humans! And I’ve\ngot proof!
A2_5340_YAMIRAMI_100_1000	(Wow! Nice job, Pikachu!)
A2_5340_BEROBA_100_1000	(Yippeeee! Now that we have proof, we can get\noutta here!)
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_4000	Well, proof is good and all, but what we really need\nto catch the culprit is time...
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_5000	And time’s something I don’t have. Right now, I gotta\nbust outta here. THEN I’ll catch the culprit!
A2_5340_GORONDA_100_1000	(Bust out? But how?)
A2_5340_LEPARDAS_100_1000	(There’s no way you can do it alone.)
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_6000	You’re right! And that’s why I need everyone’s help.
A2_5340_RENTORAR_100_1000	(...I assume you have a plan.)
A2_5340_YAMIRAMI_100_2000	(I’ll help! Just tell me what to do and I’ll do it!)
A2_5340_LEPARDAS_100_2000	(How terribly exciting! I’ll help as well, of course.)
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_7000	Thanks! I knew I could count on you all.
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_8000	But first, we’re gonna need to get those devices off\nof you.
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_9000	Otherwise, you might not be able to move around as\nyou please.
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_10000	So! Off with those pesky cubes!
A2_5340_BEROBA_100_2000	(Oooh, this thing?)
A2_5340_YAMIRAMI_100_3000	(I’ll get yours, Luxray!)
A2_5340_RENTORAR_100_2000	(So, that machine is what robbed us of our bodily\nautonomy...)
A2_5340_GORONDA_100_2000	(What should I do after I get this thing off?)
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_11000	I need you to distract the police officers, Pangoro.\nIt won’t be easy—do you think you can handle it?
A2_5340_GORONDA_100_3000	(Just leave it to me.)
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_12000	Thanks, Pangoro.
A2_5340_RENTORAR_100_3000	(Are you planning to ride on my back again?)
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_13000	Yeah, I’m countin’ on those eyes of yours!
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_14000	Oh, and Luxray—about your friend, Mightyena...
A2_5340_RENTORAR_100_4000	(Did you find something out?)
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_15000	Apparently he was detained and brought to the\nstation yesterday. He must be in one of the other\nrooms.
A2_5340_RENTORAR_100_5000	(Well then, I guess we’ll need to go to the basement.)
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_16000	Right. Once we’ve freed everyone, we can make a\nbreak for the exit.
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_16333	Oh, but you all should know that part of this roof is\nmonitored by a security camera.
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_16666	Just to cover our bases, we should pretend that we’re\nstill being controlled when we walk past that area.
A2_5340_YAMIRAMI_100_4000	(I got that thing off of you, Luxray!)
A2_5340_BEROBA_100_3000	(And I got Pangoro’s, too!)
A2_5340_RENTORAR_100_6000	(Well done, Sableye.)
A2_5340_GORONDA_100_4000	(Thanks, Impidimp. There’s no way I could’ve reached\nthat myself.)
A2_5340_GORONDA_100_5000	(I’ll get the machines off of everyone else.)
A2_5340_GORONDA_100_6000	(Hmph! Hngh! Hyah!)
A2_5340_LEPARDAS_100_3000	(Impressive... You got those off in no time at all!)
A2_5340_BEROBA_100_4000	(Thanks, Pangoro!)
A2_5340_PIKACHU_100_17000	OK, looks like we’re all ready. Let’s all get out of\nhere—together!
A2_5410_BUTLER_100_1000	What’s taking the car so long, Lieutenant McMaster?\nI asked you to call one here for me.
A2_5410_BRAD_100_1000	My apologies. It seems to be running late...
A2_5410_BUTLER_100_2000	You know how valuable my time is. I thought you were\nbetter than this.
A2_5410_BRAD_100_2000	... ... ...
A2_5410_BUTLER_100_3000	We’ll be transferring Pikachu as soon as that car gets\nhere. Make sure to pass those orders to your offi—
A2_5410_TIM_100_1000	That won’t be happening, Chief Butler!
A2_5410_BUTLER_100_4000	H-huh? What are you doing here, young detective?
A2_5410_TIM_100_2000	Pikachu is innocent. He didn’t damage that Slowpoke\nstatue!
A2_5410_RACHEL_100_1000	And now we’ll thank you to set Pikachu free!
A2_5410_BUTLER_100_5000	Are you two serious?
A2_5410_BUTLER_100_6000	Do you really think any good can come from resisting\nme, the chief of the Pokémon Protection Bureau?
A2_5410_TIM_100_3000	There’s no point in threatening us. We won’t back\ndown!
A2_5410_BUTLER_100_7000	Is that so? In that case, I’ll have you forcibly removed.
A2_5410_BUTLER_100_8000	Lieutenant McMaster! As you can see, these two are\ninterfering with a public servant in the execution of\ntheir duties! Arrest them!
A2_5410_BRAD_100_3000	... ... ...
A2_5410_BUTLER_100_9000	Are you listening to me, Lieutenant?!
A2_5410_BRAD_100_4000	Why don’t we hear what they have to say,\nChief Butler?
A2_5410_BUTLER_100_10000	What did you say?!
A2_5410_PIKACHU_100_1000	Heyyy, Tim!
A2_5410_RENTORAR_100_1000	Raaay!
A2_5430_BRAD_100_1000	All those Pokémon were innocent. Naturally, we’ll be\ncanceling that transfer for Pikachu...
A2_5430_BRAD_100_2000	And all the other Pokémon will be set free as well.
A2_5430_BUTLER_100_1000	Argh! And I covered my tracks so carefully too...
A2_5430_BUTLER_100_2000	No, I mean—! You’ve got me all wrong! This was never\nmy plan at the start!
A2_5430_BUTLER_100_3000	I intended to work hard to further the cause of\ncoexistence between humans and Pokémon.
A2_5430_BUTLER_100_4000	If those jerks hadn’t come around and tempted me\nwith all that cash...
A2_5430_TIM_100_1000	Ahem. Chief Butler, I believe you still have the\ncontroller in your possession?
A2_5430_BUTLER_100_5000	Oh. You know about that too...
A2_5450_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, I’m finally free. Thanks for all the help, Tim.
A2_5450_TIM_100_1000	Me? I couldn’t have done this without you!
A2_5450_RACHEL_100_1000	I’m so happy for you, Pikachu!
A2_5450_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux?
A2_5450_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh, sorry, Luxray. This human is my partner, Tim.
A2_5450_RENTORAR_100_2000	Lux.
A2_5450_TIM_100_2000	What’s Luxray saying?
A2_5450_PIKACHU_100_3000	He says thank you for checking up on Mightyena.
A2_5450_TIM_100_3000	Got it. Oh! That reminds me...
A2_5450_TIM_100_4000	Can you tell Luxray to please thank Indeedee for\ntreating Mightyena’s wounds?
A2_5450_PIKACHU_100_4000	Sure!
A2_5450_PIKACHU_100_5000	Anyway, Tim, about Jessica...
A2_5450_TIM_100_5000	That’s right! She’s being targeted by that Unitas\norganization.
A2_5450_TIM_100_6000	Hey, Rachel...can I ask you about Jessica?
A2_5450_RACHEL_100_2000	I just can’t believe anyone would want to target her...
A2_5450_TIM_100_7000	Jessica knows both your family and Merloch,\ndoesn’t she?
A2_5450_RACHEL_100_3000	Yeah, she worked at the research facility with my\nmother. I didn’t realize Merloch worked with them\ntoo.
A2_5450_RACHEL_100_4000	Jessica really respected my mother. She often came to\nvisit at our house.
A2_5450_RACHEL_100_5000	That’s how we became friends.
A2_5450_RACHEL_100_6000	Jessica said she lives in Bamboo Borough now.
A2_5450_TIM_100_8000	Yeah, didn’t she say she works at a pizza place?
A2_5450_PIKACHU_100_6000	In that case, Unitas might show up at Bamboo\nBorough next.
A2_5450_TIM_100_9000	We’d better go to Bamboo Borough ourselves, then.
A2_5450_RACHEL_100_7000	I’m going too! I’m worried about Jessica. You don’t\nmind, do you, Tim?
A2_5450_TIM_100_10000	No... It’s fine.
A2_5450_PIKACHU_100_7000	Ha! Like saying no would’ve stopped her!
A2_5450_TIM_100_11000	Should we go right away?
A2_5450_PIKACHU_100_8000	I’d like to, but there are still some loose ends we’ve\ngot to tie up around this case—like giving your report\nto Holiday, for starters.
A2_5450_PIKACHU_100_8500	Let’s head out tomorrow morning.
A2_5450_TIM_100_12000	OK.
A2_5450_TIM_100_13000	Rachel, we’re planning to go tomorrow morning.
A2_5450_RACHEL_100_8000	OK! I’d better get ready!
A2_5450_PIKACHU_100_9000	Then it’s settled. Tomorrow, we’re off to Bamboo\nBorough!
A2_9110_TIM_100_1000	Are you OK, Pikachu? You sure went through a lot.
A2_9110_PIKACHU_100_1000	That cube thing was awful. I wouldn’t wish that on\nanyone...
A2_9110_PIKACHU_100_2000	It was like all the colors disappeared before my eyes,\nand all sounds and smells faded away, too.
A2_9110_PIKACHU_100_3000	Pretty soon, even my own thoughts vanished, and\nbefore I knew it, I was under somebody else’s control.
A2_9110_TIM_100_2000	That’s horrible. Who would make a thing like that?!
A2_9110_PIKACHU_100_4000	We’ve just gotta keep workin’ this case. If we’re\npersistent enough, we’re bound to find the bad guy!
A2_9110_TIM_100_3000	Well, one thing we do know for sure is the name of\nthe group that was giving orders to Butler: Unitas.
A2_9110_PIKACHU_100_5000	Yeah, Butler’s motive was purely financial. He’s not\nthe one pulling the strings.
A2_9110_PIKACHU_100_6000	It seems like this Unitas organization is behind all of\nthese cases so far.
A2_9110_TIM_100_4000	But why would Unitas even want to kidnap Pokémon?
A2_9110_PIKACHU_100_7000	That’s the question, all right. I sense something really\ndark behind all this.
A2_9110_TIM_100_5000	As for Unitas’s next goal...
A2_9110_PIKACHU_100_8000	Remember that photo I found in Butler’s office?
A2_9110_TIM_100_6000	The one of Jessica, right? Rachel’s friend?
A2_9110_PIKACHU_100_9000	Between the circle on that photo and the note\nI found...
A2_9110_PIKACHU_100_10000	I think we can be certain that Unitas was ordering\nButler to find Jessica.
A2_9110_TIM_100_7000	Yeah. But why would they target her?
A2_9110_PIKACHU_100_11000	I don’t know what they want from her, but keep in\nmind that we’re dealing with an organization that’s\nwilling to kidnap Pokémon.
A2_9110_PIKACHU_100_12000	We’d better hurry and make sure Jessica’s safe.
A2_9110_TIM_100_8000	Right!
A2_9110_PIKACHU_100_13000	Oh, and by the way, Tim... Isn’t it about dinner time?
A2_9110_TIM_100_9000	Oh, I totally forgot!
A2_Detective.asset
A2_Q0110_TIM_100_10	The crime took place at Fountain Plaza.
A2_Q0110_TIM_100_20	Apparently someone broke something at the plaza,\nbut the culprit has to be someone other than Pikachu.
A2_Q0110_TIM_100_30	Assuming the culprit was a Pokémon, what kind of\nPokémon could it have been?
A2_Q0110_TIM_100_40	There might be some evidence left behind that could\nat least tell me its type... I’ll investigate Fountain Plaza\nand work out who the real culprit is!
A2_Q0110_TIM_200_10	I’ll start by investigating Fountain Plaza.
A2_Q0110_TIM_300_10	I think it’s safe to assume this incident was caused by\na Pokémon.
A2_Q0110_TIM_300_20	Looking at the evidence, it may be possible to figure\nout who the culprit is.
A2_Q0110_TIM_400_10	The statue’s fragments are charged with electricity,\nso I think it was broken with an Electric-type move.
A2_Q0110_TIM_400_20	But Pikachu can’t use any Electric-type moves, so this\ncrime must’ve been committed by another Pokémon.
A2_Q0110_TIM_400_30	It’ll be tough to prove Pikachu can’t use any\nmoves, though...
A2_Q0110_TIM_400_40	I’d better find another way to prove Pikachu’s\ninnocence.
A2_Q0110_TIM_500_10	Could the scorched grass mean the culprit is a\nFire-type Pokémon?
A2_Q0110_TIM_500_20	No... The fire would’ve spread to all the grass nearby\nif that were the case.
A2_Q0110_TIM_500_30	There would’ve been soot on the Slowpoke\nstatue too.
A2_Q0110_TIM_600_10	There was a puddle at the crime scene. Could that\nmean a Water-type Pokémon is the culprit?
A2_Q0110_TIM_600_20	No... That was probably just the water that leaked out\nof the broken fountain...
A2_Q0110_TIM_600_30	I don’t think this was done by a Water-type Pokémon.
A2_Q0110_TIM_700_10	It would take a lot of power to break that statue...\nMaybe the culprit is a Fighting-type Pokémon?
A2_Q0110_TIM_700_20	But there are scorch marks on the statue and grass, so\nI need to consider more than just raw strength.
A2_Q0110_TIM_800_10	I might’ve missed something at the scene of the crime.\nI should take another look around Fountain Plaza.
A2_Q0120_TIM_100_10	Where did Pikachu go last night?
A2_Q0120_TIM_100_20	If I figure that out, I might be able to provide him\nwith an alibi.
A2_Q0120_TIM_100_30	I should go where Pikachu most likely was and hear\nwhat the people there have to say.
A2_Q0120_TIM_200_10	I’ll start with the Hi-Hat Café and see what I can\nlearn.
A2_Q0120_TIM_300_10	Where was Pikachu when the crime took place?
A2_Q0120_TIM_300_20	I should be able to deduce that based on what I\nheard at the café and from Pikachu himself.
A2_Q0120_TIM_400_10	Pikachu said he heard the sound of thunder outside\nthe café during the evening news.
A2_Q0120_TIM_400_20	And Pablo said Pikachu was inside the café when the\nnews was on.
A2_Q0120_TIM_400_30	That proves Pikachu was not at the scene of the crime\nwhen it occurred—he was at the Hi-Hat Café!
A2_Q0120_TIM_500_10	A witness statement places Pikachu at\nFountain Plaza...
A2_Q0120_TIM_500_20	But that’s the scene of the crime, so it’s no use as an\nalibi to prove his innocence.
A2_Q0120_TIM_600_10	A witness saw Pikachu at the police station...
A2_Q0120_TIM_600_20	But that was after he’d been arrested. Definitely\ndoesn’t work as an alibi.
A2_Q0120_TIM_800_10	There must be people I haven’t talked to yet.\nI should visit the Hi-Hat Café again.
A2_Q0210_PIKACHU_100_10	I know this goes without sayin’ Tim, but I’m innocent.\nYou gotta find out who really did this!
A2_Q0210_TIM_200_10	Let’s look for evidence around Fountain Plaza.
A2_Q0210_TIM_300_10	Let’s figure out where the other Pikachu went.
A2_Q0210_TIM_400_10	These little footprints are about the right size.\nThey could belong to another Pikachu.
A2_Q0210_RACHEL_400_10	Yes, they must! And if you follow the direction they’re\nfacing...
A2_Q0210_RACHEL_400_20	It looks like they lead into that alley that goes to\n2nd Avenue.
A2_Q0210_TIM_400_20	Maybe someone on 2nd Avenue saw the other\nPikachu. Let’s go check it out!
A2_Q0210_TIM_500_10	You saw those big footprints, right? They looked like\nthey were headed toward the main street.
A2_Q0210_RACHEL_500_10	Yes, but...weren’t those footprints a little TOO big to\nbe a Pikachu’s?
A2_Q0210_TIM_500_20	You’re right... They couldn’t belong to the other\nPikachu.
A2_Q0210_TIM_600_10	Maybe the other Pikachu went berserk because it\nwas hungry. And afterward, it headed to another\nfood stall.
A2_Q0210_RACHEL_600_10	Hmm... It doesn’t really look like it went berserk here.
A2_Q0210_TIM_600_20	True... And if it was after food, it’s weird that it left\nsome on the ground.
A2_Q0210_TIM_600_30	I guess that’s just litter.
A2_Q0210_TIM_800_10	Hmm... Maybe there’s a part of the crime scene we\nhaven’t looked at yet.
A2_Q0210_RACHEL_800_10	In detective lingo, that’s called “investigating the\nscene,” right? Sounds like a plan.
A2_Q0310_TIM_100_10	Pikachu started acting weird when the cube-shaped\ndevice started glowing.
A2_Q0310_TIM_100_20	I was told it’s just a tag for management purposes, but\nI’m not so sure about that...
A2_Q0310_TIM_100_30	The witness statements I heard about Pikachu raise\nsome questions as well.
A2_Q0310_TIM_100_35	Maybe I’ll learn something if I ask around about the\nother Pokémon that were detained.
A2_Q0310_TIM_100_40	That said, there aren’t many people out and about at\nthis time of day...
A2_Q0310_TIM_100_50	Oh! There might still be customers at the Hi-Hat Café!\nI’ll head over there.
A2_Q0310_TIM_200_10	I should talk to the customers at the Hi-Hat Café.
A2_Q0310_TIM_300_10	Did anything strange happen when the Pokémon\nwere detained?
A2_Q0310_TIM_300_20	I should try to think of something that fits what I saw\nduring my visit with Pikachu.
A2_Q0310_TIM_400_10	Could they be devices for controlling Pokémon?
A2_Q0310_TIM_400_20	Maybe the Pokémon Protection Bureau uses them for\nstuff like detaining rampaging Pokémon.
A2_Q0310_TIM_400_30	But if that’s the case, is Pikachu OK? I hope it doesn’t\nhave any negative effects on him...
A2_Q0310_TIM_500_10	A witness said Pangoro was dancing, but Pikachu\ndidn’t dance...
A2_Q0310_TIM_500_20	And I don’t see the point of making Pokémon dance.\nI should probably think this over again.
A2_Q0310_TIM_600_10	If it were just a toy, there would be no reason for\nPikachu to suddenly act like that.
A2_Q0310_TIM_600_20	It must have some other function. I need to\nrethink this.
A2_Q0310_TIM_800_10	I don’t think I have enough information yet. I should\nask around the café again.
A2_Q0410_TIM_100_10	It sounds like an awful lot of Pokémon here in Ryme\nCity are being detained, doesn’t it?
A2_Q0410_RACHEL_100_10	Yeah... Even if something’s going on with the detained\nPokémon, this all seems way too sudden.
A2_Q0410_TIM_100_20	This may have something to do with the other\nPikachu, so we ought to look into it.
A2_Q0410_RACHEL_100_20	Sure! But how should we do that?
A2_Q0410_TIM_100_30	The partners of the detained Pokémon might\nknow something.
A2_Q0410_RACHEL_100_30	Good point. All right, let’s go look for their partners!
A2_Q0410_TIM_200_10	We should talk to the partners of the Pokémon who\nwere taken in.
A2_Q0410_TIM_300_10	Let’s use the information we’ve gathered to figure out\nwhat’s going on with these Pokémon.
A2_Q0410_TIM_400_10	None of the evidence left at the crime scenes seemed\nlike things those Pokémon would likely leave behind.
A2_Q0410_RACHEL_400_10	That’s true... And their partners were in shock because\nthe Pokémon were accused of doing something\ncompletely out of character.
A2_Q0410_TIM_400_20	Just like when Pikachu was arrested. The same thing\nkeeps happening...
A2_Q0410_RACHEL_400_20	There’s photographic evidence for every crime,\nthough.
A2_Q0410_RACHEL_400_30	As strange as this all seems, it’d be difficult to\nconvince the PPB that something’s off.
A2_Q0410_TIM_400_30	Every crime has photo evidence... And the Pokémon\nare behaving out of character...
A2_Q0410_TIM_400_40	What if...those Pokémon are being framed?
A2_Q0410_RACHEL_400_40	Wha—?! What makes you say that?
A2_Q0410_TIM_400_50	Oh! Uh... Sorry, I guess that’s a pretty big claim.\nI can’t say for sure...
A2_Q0410_TIM_400_60	Still, a lot of things at the crime scenes just don’t add\nup. I don’t think we can rule it out just yet.
A2_Q0410_RACHEL_400_50	If that IS what’s happening, I sure hope we can do\nsomething to help those Pokémon.
A2_Q0410_TIM_500_10	Something must’ve really irritated Inteleon for him to\nmess up those flowers so suddenly.
A2_Q0410_RACHEL_500_10	Are you saying all the other detained Pokémon were\nangry too?
A2_Q0410_TIM_500_20	I guess that’d be a bit of a stretch... I’d better think\nthis over some more.
A2_Q0410_TIM_600_10	Maybe they were so desperate for food they resorted\nto stealing it from people?
A2_Q0410_RACHEL_600_10	That might’ve been the case for Morpeko, but not so\nmuch for the other Pokémon, don’t you think?
A2_Q0410_TIM_600_20	Good point... I’ll think this over again.
A2_Q0410_TIM_700_10	Maybe those Pokémon had a habit of stealing things?
A2_Q0410_RACHEL_700_10	That might’ve been the case for Impidimp, but not so\nmuch for the other Pokémon, don’t you think?
A2_Q0410_TIM_700_20	Hmm... That’s a good point.
A2_Q0410_TIM_800_10	We don’t have enough information to start\ndeducing just yet.
A2_Q0410_TIM_800_20	We should talk to the partners of the Pokémon who\nwere taken in.
A2_Q0420_TIM_100_10	Let’s say for the moment that the PPB and the police\nare framing innocent Pokémon.
A2_Q0420_RACHEL_100_10	If that’s the case, what are they trying to accomplish?
A2_Q0420_TIM_100_20	Hmm... Are they just detaining Pokémon without\ndoing thorough investigations? Or is there more to it\nthan that?
A2_Q0420_TIM_100_30	I couldn’t say WHY, but maybe detaining Pokémon\nisn’t a means to an end—maybe it’s their actual goal.
A2_Q0420_RACHEL_100_20	You mean the PPB and the police are just out there\ntrying to pump up their numbers?!
A2_Q0420_RACHEL_100_30	Do they really have that little respect for Pokémon?!
A2_Q0420_TIM_100_40	Whoa, Rachel, wait a sec!
A2_Q0420_TIM_100_50	We need to investigate a bit more before we draw\nany conclusions. Things aren’t quite adding up\njust yet.
A2_Q0420_RACHEL_100_40	You’re right. Sorry... I got a little heated just now.
A2_Q0420_TIM_100_60	It’s OK. Let’s start asking people in the city about the\nrecent detainments.
A2_Q0420_RACHEL_100_50	Sounds good.
A2_Q0420_TIM_200_10	Let’s interview the police about the\nPokémon detainments.
A2_Q0420_TIM_300_10	Let’s think about whether there’s anything strange\nabout the PPB’s activity.
A2_Q0420_TIM_400_10	Morpeko, Impidimp, Inteleon, and Pikachu...
A2_Q0420_TIM_400_20	A lot of Pokémon have been detained in different\nplaces...
A2_Q0420_TIM_400_23	Yet somehow, the few surveillance cameras in the city\nmanaged to film each one of them...
A2_Q0420_RACHEL_400_3	Seems too good to be true...
A2_Q0420_RACHEL_400_6	Not to mention the surveillance cameras caught\nthe exact moment each crime was committed.
A2_Q0420_TIM_400_26	Right. Seems a bit too convenient.
A2_Q0420_RACHEL_400_10	Maybe the PPB staged the crimes and filmed them?
A2_Q0420_TIM_400_30	That’s definitely a possibility...
A2_Q0420_TIM_500_10	Maybe the police officers are so busy that they\nhaven’t been thoroughly investigating the crimes...?
A2_Q0420_RACHEL_500_10	I guess, but I didn’t get that impression when we\ntalked to them.
A2_Q0420_TIM_500_20	Hmm... All right, I need to rethink this a bit.
A2_Q0420_TIM_600_10	According to the police, they’re being extra vigilant\nsince it’s Pokémon Friendship Week.
A2_Q0420_TIM_600_20	They could be aggressively detaining Pokémon to\nmake sure nothing like the R incident happens again...
A2_Q0420_RACHEL_600_10	But Friendship Week is meant to celebrate\ncoexistence between humans and Pokémon, right?
A2_Q0420_RACHEL_600_20	Rounding up innocent Pokémon goes completely\nagainst that!
A2_Q0420_TIM_600_30	You’re right... I’ll rethink this a bit.
A2_Q0420_TIM_800_10	We don’t have enough information yet.
A2_Q0420_TIM_800_20	Let’s interview the officers around the police station.
A2_Q0430_TIM_100_10	Even if the Pokémon Protection Bureau staged the\nincidents, the actual crimes had to have been\ncommitted by a Pokémon.
A2_Q0430_RACHEL_100_10	All the partners of the detained Pokémon said the\nsame thing.
A2_Q0430_RACHEL_100_15	They’re convinced that their Pokémon would never\ncommit the crimes they’ve been accused of.
A2_Q0430_TIM_100_30	I can really only think of one possible explanation.
A2_Q0430_TIM_100_40	A different Pokémon than the ones that were\ndetained committed all of the crimes.
A2_Q0430_RACHEL_100_20	We’ve gotta find a Pokémon that can make itself look\nlike other Pokémon.
A2_Q0430_TIM_100_50	Yeah. Let’s go ask some folks in the city.
A2_Q0430_TIM_200_10	Let’s interview people about Pokémon that can look\nlike other Pokémon.
A2_Q0430_TIM_300_10	Which Pokémon committed the crimes?\nLet’s think it over.
A2_Q0430_PIKACHU_400_10	A Ditto, huh? Yeah, a Ditto could’ve made itself look\nlike me.
A2_Q0430_TIM_400_10	Ditto’s partner said that Ditto can only copy things it\ncan see.
A2_Q0430_TIM_400_20	That probably explains why there were no stripes on\nthe Pikachu’s back in the photo.
A2_Q0430_PIKACHU_400_20	But I’ve looked in every detainment cell, and I didn’t\nsee a Ditto in any of them.
A2_Q0430_TIM_400_30	That’s strange... If it was detained, it should be in a\ndetainment cell.
A2_Q0430_PIKACHU_400_30	Guess I better search the other rooms in the station.
A2_Q0430_TIM_500_10	Maybe you DID commit the crime, but you don’t\nremember doing it because of the device.
A2_Q0430_PIKACHU_500_10	C’mon, Tim. The Pikachu in the photo didn’t have\nmy stripes on its back, remember?
A2_Q0430_PIKACHU_500_20	Besides, even if I HAD destroyed the Slowpoke\nstatue, that still wouldn’t explain all the other crimes.
A2_Q0430_TIM_500_20	Right... That’s true. I’ll think it over again.
A2_Q0430_TIM_600_10	Luxray’s moves could’ve destroyed the\nSlowpoke statue, right?
A2_Q0430_PIKACHU_600_10	They could have, but that wouldn’t explain all\nthe other crimes.
A2_Q0430_TIM_600_20	Right... That’s true. I’ll think it over again.
A2_Q0430_TIM_800_10	We don’t have enough information to come to\na conclusion...
A2_Q0430_TIM_800_20	I’ll check in with Pikachu. Maybe he’s found\nsomething at the police station.
A2_Q0510_TIM_100_10	I wonder what Brad was doing at the crime scenes...
A2_Q0510_PIKACHU_100_10	I suppose you could just ask him.
A2_Q0510_PIKACHU_100_20	But if he was up to somethin’ shady, he might just give\nus the runaround.
A2_Q0510_TIM_100_20	In that case, maybe we should ask the other\npolice officers.
A2_Q0510_PIKACHU_100_30	Agreed. You might wanna ask people in the city what\nthey think of him too.
A2_Q0510_TIM_200_10	We should ask police officers and civilians\nabout Brad.
A2_Q0510_TIM_300_10	I’ve collected a good amount of information about\nBrad. Now it’s time to organize it and think this\nthrough.
A2_Q0510_TIM_400_10	If Brad were the one giving orders to Ditto, there’d be\nno reason for him to go around asking questions after\ndetaining the Pokémon.
A2_Q0510_RACHEL_400_10	So you think Brad’s just investigating the incidents?\nLike we are?
A2_Q0510_TIM_400_20	Yeah, I do.
A2_Q0510_TIM_500_10	It’s possible that Brad’s hiding evidence of the crimes.
A2_Q0510_RACHEL_500_10	So you think he staged the incidents, and now he’s\ntrying to cover his tracks?
A2_Q0510_RACHEL_500_20	Hmm... But if that’s the case, shouldn’t he have been\nable to hide all of the evidence so far—all the way\nback to the incident at Fountain Plaza?
A2_Q0510_TIM_500_20	Good point. If he wanted to get rid of evidence, he\ncould have done so way earlier...
A2_Q0510_TIM_600_10	He might have been going around casing the crime\nscenes in preparation for something.
A2_Q0510_RACHEL_600_10	Doesn’t “casing a scene” usually occur BEFORE a\ncrime though?
A2_Q0510_RACHEL_600_20	Why would he be doing it after?
A2_Q0510_TIM_600_20	That’s...a great point.
A2_Q0510_TIM_800_10	We might not have enough information yet...
A2_Q0510_TIM_800_20	Let’s keep gathering information on Brad.
A2_Q0520_TIM_100_10	Someone who could’ve been involved in every single\nincident and also given orders to Pokémon...
A2_Q0520_PIKACHU_100_10	Yep. That’s our culprit.
A2_Q0520_TIM_200_10	I don’t think we have enough information to deduce\nwho that is yet.
A2_Q0520_TIM_300_10	Let’s think about who the real culprit might be.
A2_Q0520_TIM_400_10	Chief Butler was ordered to capture and transfer\nPokémon—and he was getting paid for it too...
A2_Q0520_PIKACHU_400_10	And we found those orders in his office.
A2_Q0520_TIM_400_20	Yep. Which means the real culprit is...
A2_Q0520_PIKACHU_400_20	The head of the Pokémon Protection\nBureau—Chief Butler!
A2_Q0520_TIM_500_10	The culprit is Brad! He staged all the incidents, then\n“solved” them all himself to get a promotion!
A2_Q0520_PIKACHU_500_10	*sigh* Tim...didn’t we already investigate Brad’s\nbehavior and conclude he wasn’t the culprit?
A2_Q0520_TIM_500_20	Heh... Sorry. Must be this room—it’s so hot and\ncramped in here, I can’t think straight. Or is that\njust me?
A2_Q0520_RACHEL_500_10	Uhhh... Tim? Did I hear you say something about Brad\ntrying for a promotion? That was a joke, right?
A2_Q0520_TIM_500_30	What? Oh, uh...never mind that. Just warming up\nbefore we actually get started...
A2_Q0520_PIKACHU_500_20	Smooth, Tim. Now even Rachel’s gettin’ worried.\nTry to get your act together, will ya?
A2_Q0520_TIM_600_10	Inspector Holiday and Chief Butler didn’t see eye to\neye at all.
A2_Q0520_TIM_600_20	Maybe Inspector Holiday staged the incidents to\nmake trouble for the PPB...or something?
A2_Q0520_PIKACHU_600_10	Wow. Bold claim—but a bit of a stretch, don’t you\nthink?
A2_Q0520_PIKACHU_600_20	For starters, what evidence do you have of Holiday\nbeing involved with ANY of these crimes?
A2_Q0520_TIM_600_30	Well, when you put it like that...I guess I’d better think\nthis over again.
A2_Q0520_TIM_800_10	I don’t think we have enough information to figure\nthis out yet. Let’s do a little more investigating.
A2_Q0610_TIM_100_10	So, about how those cube-shaped devices work...
A2_Q0610_PIKACHU_100_10	I keep losing my memory here in the police station, so\nI really don’t know much about them...
A2_Q0610_PIKACHU_100_20	Try asking people in the city about ’em.
A2_Q0610_PIKACHU_100_30	I’m sure there are people who’ve seen those\ndevices attached to Pokémon. Try hearin’ what\nthey’ve got to say.
A2_Q0610_TIM_200_10	We don’t have enough information yet. We should\nask people about the devices.
A2_Q0610_TIM_300_10	Let’s figure out what those cube-shaped devices\nreally are.
A2_Q0610_TIM_400_10	Those devices might actually be capable of\ncontrolling Pokémon.
A2_Q0610_RACHEL_400_10	You really think so?
A2_Q0610_TIM_400_20	I do. We don’t have any evidence yet, of course, but\nit seems that way based on what we’ve heard.
A2_Q0610_RACHEL_400_20	If that’s true, then Ditto...
A2_Q0610_TIM_400_30	...Was forced to obey someone else’s orders, yeah.
A2_Q0610_RACHEL_400_30	That’s terrible...
A2_Q0610_TIM_500_10	Maybe the devices can make Pokémon go berserk.
A2_Q0610_TIM_500_20	Oh, wait, hold on... Didn’t we hear that the detained\nPokémon calmed down because of the devices?
A2_Q0610_RACHEL_500_10	Someone did tell us that one of the Pokémon was\n“struggling,” but I don’t think the devices actually \ncaused that.
A2_Q0610_TIM_500_30	Yeah, I think you’re right. Let’s think this over again.
A2_Q0610_TIM_600_10	Maybe the devices glow to make Pokémon stand out.
A2_Q0610_TIM_600_20	That way, if someone witnessed a Pokémon\ncommitting a crime, it’d be easier to prove they\ndid it.
A2_Q0610_RACHEL_600_10	That does sound plausible—but didn’t we hear that\nthe devices only began glowing after an incident\nhad already occurred?
A2_Q0610_RACHEL_600_20	A police officer even told us that the Pokémon\ncalmed down after the devices started glowing.
A2_Q0610_TIM_600_30	You’re right... Hmm. Yeah, I don’t think this is\nour answer.
A2_Q0610_TIM_800_10	We might not have enough information yet...
A2_Q0610_TIM_800_20	Let’s keep asking people about the\ncube-shaped devices.
A2_Q0620_TIM_100_10	If the person orchestrating these crimes was\ncontrolling Ditto, how were they able to give it\norders?
A2_Q0620_TIM_100_20	Based on all the witness statements so far, it’s not\nclear whether anyone was directing Ditto’s actions...
A2_Q0620_RACHEL_100_10	True, but there had to have been someone at the\ncrime scenes talking directly to Ditto, right?
A2_Q0620_TIM_100_30	Yeah. I can’t really think of any other method they\ncould have used.
A2_Q0620_TIM_100_40	Maybe a witness saw someone giving out orders...
A2_Q0620_RACHEL_100_20	Yeah... We should ask around.
A2_Q0620_TIM_200_10	We don’t have enough information yet...
A2_Q0620_TIM_300_10	We got a lot of information from people in the city,\nand we have the evidence you found in the chief’s\noffice.
A2_Q0620_TIM_300_20	We should try deducing the method the culprit used\nto give orders to Ditto.
A2_Q0620_PIKACHU_400_10	According to the instruction manual, the devices can\nbe operated remotely using a controller.
A2_Q0620_TIM_400_10	Hmm... I thought the culprit needed to be at the\nscene of the crime to give orders...
A2_Q0620_TIM_400_20	but if they used a controller to give orders from afar,\nthey could’ve avoided being seen by witnesses.
A2_Q0620_PIKACHU_400_20	All right. So now we know how the culprit did it.
A2_Q0620_TIM_500_10	Maybe there was another Pokémon at the crime\nscenes that was giving orders to Ditto.
A2_Q0620_PIKACHU_500_10	Pokémon may be able to understand each other, but\ndon’t we already know that a human is responsible for\nthese crimes?
A2_Q0620_PIKACHU_500_20	Even if another Pokémon was giving orders to Ditto,\nthat Pokémon must’ve been getting its orders from a\nhuman. The question is, how?
A2_Q0620_TIM_500_20	Good point. Guess I better rethink this...
A2_Q0620_TIM_600_10	Maybe one of the victims was giving orders to Ditto.
A2_Q0620_PIKACHU_600_10	You’re saying all these incidents were inside jobs that\na phony victim pulled off? Tim, you’re forgetting a\nkey detail.
A2_Q0620_TIM_600_20	What do you mean?
A2_Q0620_PIKACHU_600_20	There was no “victim” in the Fountain Plaza incident.\nSo who would’ve been giving orders to “me”?
A2_Q0620_TIM_600_30	I guess that was a bit of a stretch...
A2_Q0620_PIKACHU_600_30	I know you’re probably tired, Tim, but you gotta get\nit together.
A2_Q0620_TIM_800_10	We might not have enough information yet...
A2_Q0620_TIM_800_20	I should try talking to Pikachu again.
A2_Drama.asset
A2_Drama_TIM_100_10	Huh?!
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_100_10	What’s this?
A2_Drama_BRAD_100_10	Hello, “Great Detective.” I’m here for Pikachu.

A2_Drama_NOFACEANNOUNCE_200_10	It’s time for exercise.\nProceed to the roof, single file.
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_200_7_NOMESSAGE	Huh.
A2_Drama_YAMIRAMI_200_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - groan, as if losing will/consciousness)
A2_Drama_GORONDA_200_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - groan, as if losing will/consciousness)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_200_10	Hey... You guys all right?

A2_Drama_PIKACHU_200_30	Body’s moving on its own...

A2_Drama_PIKACHU_300_30	Huh?
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_300_35	Huh? Wh-what? How did...?
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_300_40	What...what just happened?
A2_Drama_YAMIRAMI_300_40_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - confused)\n(What’s going on?)
A2_Drama_GORONDA_300_30_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - growls)\n(Huh?)
A2_Drama_YAMIRAMI_400_10	(This is the newbie I was telling you about.)
A2_Drama_RENTORAR_400_10	(So, you’re the talkative Pikachu.)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_400_5_NOMESSAGE	(small grunt)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_400_10	Huh?!
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_400_20	What’re you supposed to be, the big boss\nof this place? You gotta be joking.
A2_Drama_RENTORAR_400_20	(I’ll teach you the rules around here.)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_400_30	Like Jail 101 or something?
A2_Drama_RENTORAR_400_30	(Wow. You don’t know when to stop talking.)
A2_Drama_RENTORAR_400_40	(Rule number one!)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_400_40_NOMESSAGE	Ugharghgah!
A2_Drama_RENTORAR_400_50	(He fainted? That attack shouldn’t\nhave been very effective...)
A2_Drama_YAMIRAMI_400_20	(Pathetic.)
A2_Drama_TIM_500_5	You’ll get out soon. Just hang in there.
A2_Drama_PAPOLICEMAN02_500_10	Time’s up.
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_500_10	Hold on! We’re not done yet!
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_500_20	Ngh! Ahh...
A2_Drama_TIM_500_10	What’s wrong, Pikachu?
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_500_30	My body’s moving on its own.
A2_Drama_TIM_500_20	Huh? That light...
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_600_10	*sigh*
A2_Drama_GORONDA_600_10	(Here we go, I guess...)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_600_20	Wh-whoa! What are you—?!
A2_Drama_GORONDA_600_20_NOMESSAGE	(growl) (tossing Pikachu)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_600_30	Hey!
A2_Drama_GORONDA_600_30_NOMESSAGE	(growl) (tossing Pikachu)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_600_40	Stop!

A2_Drama_PIKACHU_700_50	C’mon! Can’t someone...give me...a little help?
A2_Drama_BEROBA_700_10	(Hee hee hee!)
A2_Drama_LEPARDAS_700_10	(You can’t even get yourself\nup there? How precious.)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_700_60_NOMESSAGE	Awawawah!
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_700_70	Whoa, not like thaaat!
A2_Drama_LEPARDAS_700_20_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_700_80_NOMESSAGE	Oof!
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_700_90	Phew!
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_700_100	Let’s go, Luxray!
A2_Drama_RENTORAR_700_10	(Yeah!)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_900_10	Oh no—someone’s coming!
A2_Drama_METAMON_900_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)\n(Wha?)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_900_20	Let’s hide there!
A2_Drama_METAMON_900_20_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - hurried)\n(Awawawah)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_900_30_NOMESSAGE	(hurried, flustered sounds)
A2_Drama_METAMON_900_30_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - hurried)\n(Awawawah)
A2_Drama_BUTLER_900_10	Please, come in.
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_900_32_NOMESSAGE	(Hm?)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_900_34_NOMESSAGE	(Slight grunt as Pikachu crouches back down)
A2_Drama_BUTLER_900_15_NOMESSAGE	(sitting motion react)
A2_Drama_SECRETMURDOCH_900_10	Thanks to your information, the jewel\nis now in my possession.
A2_Drama_SECRETMURDOCH_900_20	As for the matter of that woman and Pikachu...
A2_Drama_BUTLER_900_20	That Pikachu is being transferred\ntomorrow—detective hat and all.
A2_Drama_SECRETMURDOCH_900_30	I see. I won’t tolerate any mistakes.
A2_Drama_BUTLER_900_25	Hm.
A2_Drama_SECRETMURDOCH_900_40	If you’d like more money, deal\nwith that woman for me, too.
A2_Drama_BUTLER_900_30	Leave it to me, sir.
A2_Drama_SECRETMURDOCH_900_50	Now then, I’d like to see how things are\nprogressing with the Control Cubes.
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_900_36_NOMESSAGE	(Quiet gasp)
A2_Drama_BUTLER_900_40	Yes, sir.
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_900_38_NOMESSAGE	(whispered panting to movement)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_900_40	Phew!
A2_Drama_METAMON_900_40_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)\n(Yay!)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_900_50	That guy Butler met with... Who could he be?
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_900_60	Plus, he said I’m getting transferred tomorrow.
A2_Drama_METAMON_900_50_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)\n(Yep!)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_900_70	Sounds like we better hurry...
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_10	Tight security... Along with these cubes...
A2_Drama_TIM_1000_10	What are you thinking, Pikachu?
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_20	Aha! I hadn’t thought of that!
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_30_NOMESSAGE	(jumping exertion)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_40_NOMESSAGE	(jumping exertion)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_50	A bolt of brilliance!
A2_Drama_TIM_1000_20	Huh?
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_60	If I get the other Pokémon to help, we can all escape!
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_70	And I can finally get outta here!
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_800_10_NOMESSAGE	(exertion grunts to movement)
A2_Drama_YAMIRAMI_800_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)\n(Hunh?)
A2_Drama_GORONDA_800_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)\n(What’s goin’ on?)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_800_20	Ngh! It’s not coming off...
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_800_30_NOMESSAGE	(exertion grunts to movement)
A2_Drama_YAMIRAMI_800_20_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)\n(Hunh?)

A2_Drama_PIKACHU_800_40_NOMESSAGE	(exertion grunts to movement)
A2_Drama_YAMIRAMI_800_30_NOMESSAGE	(Oh?)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_800_50	It’s just too... Hm? Huh?
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_800_60	Oh! I got it off!
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_800_70	All right, I did it! I’m free!
A2_Drama_YAMIRAMI_800_40_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - confused)\n(What’s going on?)
A2_Drama_GORONDA_800_20_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - growl)\n(He seems happy?)

A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1100_36_NOMESSAGE	(small react to being lifted)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1100_40	Ready?
A2_Drama_GORONDA_1100_40	(Good to go!)
A2_Drama_RENTORAR_1100_30	(Me too!)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1100_50	OK! Let’s do this!
A2_Drama_RENTORAR_1100_40	(Yeah!)
A2_Drama_GORONDA_1100_50_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - roar)\n(Yeah!)
A2_Drama_TIM_1200_10	Now, Chief Butler, please hand over the controller.

A2_Drama_BUTLER_1200_30_NOMESSAGE	(grunting, coughing)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1200_10	What’s going on?!
A2_Drama_TIM_1200_30_NOMESSAGE	(grunt, then a small gasp of realization)
A2_Drama_TIM_1200_40	Ahh! It’s broken!
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1200_20_NOMESSAGE	(jumping exert)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1200_30	There goes our proof...
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1200_40	Well, that’s just great...
A2_Drama_TIM_1200_50_NOMESSAGE	(no subtitle)
A2_Drama_BRAD_1200_20	Well, Chief—no, Butler.\nI’ve got a lot of questions for you.
A2_Drama_BRAD_1200_30	Now, come with me.
A2_Drama_BUTLER_1200_40_NOMESSAGE	(resigned grunt)
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1200_50	Blinded by cash... He lost\nsight of the path of justice.
A2_Drama_IRENE_1300_10	So, you’ll take care of dinner tonight?
A2_Drama_TIM_1300_10	Yeah, no problem.
A2_Drama_TIM_1300_20	...It won’t be anything special, though.
A2_Drama_IRENE_1300_20	Oh! I still need to get Sophia.
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_10	Oh hey, Irene! You dropped your ring!
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_20	...Right, she can’t understand me.
A2_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_30	Oh well.

A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_100_10	This new bureau may claim that\nthey’re protecting Pokémon...
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_100_20	But they arrested me!
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_200_10	I can’t use any of my moves.
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_200_20	I hope the other Pokémon\ndon’t find out...
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_300_10	Wonder what Tim’s up to...
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_300_20	He better not be drinking\ncoffee without me.
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_400_10	*sigh* I could really go for some of\nIrene’s mac and cheese right about now.
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_500_10	Ah...ah...achoo!
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_500_20	Someone must be thinking\nabout me. I feel so popular.
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_600_10	Thanks for your help, Luxray.\nCouldn’t have done it without ya.
A2_PikaTalk_RENTORAR_600_10	(No need to thank me.)
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_600_20	How are you so cool?!
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_700_10	How’d you become the boss of\nall the Pokémon here anyway?
A2_PikaTalk_RENTORAR_700_10	(I’m not. They’re just intimidated by me.)
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_700_20	Heh. I can see why!
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_800_10	Hey Luxray, won’t you get tired if you\nkeep looking through objects so much?
A2_PikaTalk_RENTORAR_800_10	(Only if I do it for hours on end.)
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_800_20	Gotcha. Well, sorry for the trouble.
A2_PikaTalk_RENTORAR_800_20	(No need to apologize.\nThis is nothing to me!)
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_800_30	Man, you are SO cool!
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_900_10	Hey Luxray—if you can see through\nwalls, you can see all kinds of\nthings, right?
A2_PikaTalk_RENTORAR_900_10	(I suppose.)
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_900_20	I guess that means you’ve got an EYE\nfor detail! Hah! I’ll SEE myself out!
A2_PikaTalk_RENTORAR_900_20	(Enough jokes!)
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_900_30	Waaaaaah!
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1000_10	Hey, Tim. What’d you bring me?
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1000_20	Huh? What do you mean,\nyou didn’t bring anything...?
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1100_10	Aw, man. The service in this\nplace stinks. Can’t even get a\ncup of coffee around here.
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1100_20	“Pokémon Protection Bureau,” my foot!
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1200_10	This whole time I’ve been trying to\nfigure out why I ended up in this place...
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1200_20	But unfortunately, I have no idea.
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1300_10	Did this happen because I’ve\nbeen misbehaving somehow?
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1300_20	No! I’m a well-behaved Pokémon, so\nthat can’t be why. Which means...
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1300_30	something strange is going on\nbehind the scenes.
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1400_10	Hey, you! Don’t just stand\nthere doing nothing!
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1400_20	Bring me a cup of\ncoffee or something!
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1500_10	Hey Tim, bring me some coffee beans\nnext time you visit, OK?
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1500_20	I’ll take care of the hot water.
A2_PikaTalk_BEROBA_1600_10	(Something bothering you?)
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1600_10	You know EXACTLY what’s bothering\nme! Now stop looking so happy about it!
A2_PikaTalk_BEROBA_1600_20_NOMESSAGE	(Hee hee hee!)
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1700_10	So, I hear you love jewels...\nAre you familiar with the Aurora Drop?
A2_PikaTalk_YAMIRAMI_1700_10	(Nah. I dunno what that is.\nNever even heard of it.)
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1700_20	Really? You sure?
A2_PikaTalk_YAMIRAMI_1700_20	(You callin’ me a liar?\nDon’t mess with me!)
A2_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1700_30	No, no! I believe you!

A2_SRT_EMILIA_9200_10	This is GNN News.
A2_SRT_EMILIA_9200_20	Pokémon incidents are on the rise.
A2_SRT_EMILIA_9200_30	A swarm of Beedrill descended\non Ryme City last night.
A2_SRT_EMILIA_9200_40	Though citizens were in danger, we can\nthankfully confirm that no one was harmed.

A2_SRT_EMILIA_9200_60	Mayor Myers has said addressing\nthese incidents is his top priority.
A2_SRT_TIM_9200_10	That happened yesterday!
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_9200_10	Yeah... No mention of that group\nin the white uniforms, though.
A2_SRT_TIM_9200_20	Or Dad, for that matter...
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_9200_20	We can’t just ignore those weirdos.\nWe need more information.
A2_SRT_TIM_9200_30	You’re right. We should go\ntalk to Inspector Holiday.
A2_SRT_SOPHIA_4100_10	I went to Ryme Tower with Mom\nyesterday! The view was SUPER pretty.
A2_SRT_IRENE_4100_10	Let’s all go together next time.
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_4100_10	No thanks—you can count me out.\nI’ve got no time for sightseeing.
A2_SRT_SOPHIA_4100_20	Pikachu will come too, of course!
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_4100_20	Are you hearing a word I’m saying?!
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_4100_30	...Oh yeah. Of course not.
A2_SRT_SOPHIA_4100_30	... ... ...
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_100_10	Unh...
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_100_20	Nnngh...
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_100_30	Where...am I?
A2_SRT_HOLIDAY_700_10	Tim! I thought I’d find you here.
A2_SRT_TIM_700_10	Inspector Holiday!
A2_SRT_TIM_700_20	And...Chief Butler.
A2_SRT_BUTLER_700_10	I understand how concerned\nyou are about your Pikachu.
A2_SRT_BUTLER_700_20	Don’t worry—the Pokémon Protection\nBureau is a safe place.
A2_SRT_TIM_1200_10	Wait, is that...Brad?
A2_SRT_TIM_1200_20	Why is he at the crime scene?
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_1000_10	Tim!
A2_SRT_TIM_1000_10	Pikachu!
A2_SRT_TIM_1000_20	Thank goodness...\nYou really had me worried!
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_1000_20	Hey! Keep your voice down.\nDon’t call attention to us.
A2_SRT_TIM_1000_30	Ah... R-right.
A2_SRT_HOLIDAY_900_10	...So that’s the situation.
A2_SRT_TIM_900_10	Hmm...
A2_SRT_BUTLER_900_10	This is quite the place for\na conversation, gentlemen.
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_6900_10	Hm? Someone’s coming!
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7000_10	All right, Pangoro! Go slow, OK?
A2_SRT_GORONDA_7000_10	(Aim for a speed record—got it!)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7000_20	Huh?!
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7100_10_NOMESSAGE	*heavy breathing* (crawling exertions)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7100_20_NOMESSAGE	*grunts* (trying to squeeze through)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7100_30	Whoa!
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7100_40	A perfect 10-point landing!
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7200_10	Thanks for the help, Inteleon!
A2_SRT_INTEREON_7200_10	(Sure thing. Try not to bite your tongue.)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7200_20	Huh?
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7300_10_NOMESSAGE	*heavy breathing* (crawling exerts)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7300_20_NOMESSAGE	*grunts* (trying to squeeze through)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7300_30	Whoa!
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7300_40	Ow, ow, ow, ow... That hurt!
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7400_10	Watchog! I’m counting on you!
A2_SRT_MIRUHOG_7400_10	(Leave it to me! Make sure\nyou curl up into a ball.)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7400_20	Wha—?
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7500_10_NOMESSAGE	*heavy breathing* (crawling exertions)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7500_20_NOMESSAGE	*grunts* (trying to squeeze through)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7500_30	Whoa!
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7500_40	I did it! Oww...
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7600_10	C’mon, Liepard! You got this?
A2_SRT_LEPARDAS_7600_10	(I’ll try. I do hope we’re successful.)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7600_20	Huh?
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7700_10_NOMESSAGE	*heavy breathing* (crawling exertions)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7700_20_NOMESSAGE	*grunts* (trying to squeeze through)

A2_SRT_RENTORAR_1700_5_NOMESSAGE	PKMN cry
A2_SRT_RENTORAR_1700_10	(How careless of me...)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_1700_20	We’re not out just yet!
A2_SRT_RENTORAR_4700_5_NOMESSAGE	PKMN cry
A2_SRT_RENTORAR_4700_10	(Hmph... We’ve been spotted.)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_4700_20	I swear we’ll get outta here!
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_2000_10	Scope it out, Luxray!
A2_SRT_RENTORAR_2000_10	(I’m on it.)
A2_SRT_RENTORAR_2000_20	(Butler’s just sitting in his chair,\nlooking all self-important...)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_2000_20	Not even doing his work, huh.\nDo you see anything suspicious?
A2_SRT_RENTORAR_2000_30	(There’s a duct outlet on the wall.)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_2000_30	That means I can sneak in through there.
A2_SRT_RENTORAR_2000_40	(And I see a bowl on the floor too.)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_2000_40	For a Pokémon, maybe? Except...I’ve\nnever seen Butler with a Pokémon.
A2_SRT_RENTORAR_2000_50	(There’s also a sturdy metal box\nwith something inside of it.)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_2000_50	Huh. Could be a safe.
A2_SRT_RACHEL_1100_10	Tim!
A2_SRT_TIM_1100_10	Rachel! What’s wrong?
A2_SRT_RACHEL_1100_20	What do you mean “what’s wrong”?!\nIs it true that Pikachu got arrested?
A2_SRT_HOWARD_6800_10	Hello, Ryme City.\nThis is your mayor speaking.
A2_SRT_HOWARD_6800_20	In response to the unfortunate past\nevents that took place in our city...
A2_SRT_HOWARD_6800_30	we’ve labored tirelessly to bring\npeople and Pokémon together in\npeace and safety.
A2_SRT_HOWARD_6800_40	On the last day of\nPokémon Friendship Week...
A2_SRT_HOWARD_6800_50	I will unveil a revolutionary device—\nthe culmination of our efforts!
A2_SRT_PABLO_6800_10	Mayor’s working hard, I see!
A2_SRT_PABLO_6800_20	He looks serious about never letting\nanything like the R incident happen again.
A2_SRT_TIM_6800_10	I wonder what that\n“revolutionary device” is.
A2_SRT_PABLO_6800_30	Beats me. Could be anything.
A2_SRT_TIM_4400_10	Hm? There’s Brad again.
A2_SRT_RACHEL_4400_10	Is he a detective?\nHe’s checking out the cart.
A2_SRT_TIM_4400_20	I wonder if he found something.
A2_SRT_MURDOCH_1600_10	Tim? Why, imagine us running into each\nother again—here of all places!
A2_SRT_TIM_1600_10	You’re that guy who suddenly plucked\nsome of Pikachu’s fur...
A2_SRT_MURDOCH_1600_20	Yes, I’m Charles Merloch, scientist and\npolicy mastermind of Ryme City.
A2_SRT_MURDOCH_1600_30	Where’s your partner Pikachu? Don’t\ntell me you two had a falling out?
A2_SRT_TIM_1600_20	No, nothing like that...
A2_SRT_RACHEL_1600_10	I know you! You’re the one who\nkeeps meeting with my dad!
A2_SRT_MURDOCH_1600_40	Well, well! The mayor’s daughter!\nYou know, Ryme City has become\nrather dangerous lately.
A2_SRT_MURDOCH_1600_50	I know how much Howard worries about\nyou. I suggest you head home soon.
A2_SRT_RACHEL_1600_20	And I suggest you mind your business!
A2_SRT_TIM_1500_10	Rachel...
A2_SRT_TIM_1500_15	There’s something I want to tell you.
A2_SRT_RACHEL_1500_10	What is it? It sounds pretty serious.
A2_SRT_TIM_1500_20	I don’t expect you to believe me,\nbut the truth is...
A2_SRT_TIM_1500_30	I can...understand everything\nPikachu says!
A2_SRT_RACHEL_4500_10	Once, when I got lost in the forest\nin Bamboo Borough,
A2_SRT_RACHEL_4500_15	an Ursaring helped me out.
A2_SRT_TIM_4500_10	An Ursaring?
A2_SRT_RACHEL_4500_20	That’s right. I was cold,\nlonely, and crying...
A2_SRT_RACHEL_4500_25	But it stayed by my side\nand kept me safe.
A2_SRT_RACHEL_4500_30	I know that Ursaring helped me because\nit could understand what I was feeling.
A2_SRT_RACHEL_4500_40	And that’s why I wholeheartedly believe\nthat Pokémon and humans can\nunderstand each other’s feelings.
A2_SRT_RACHEL_4500_50	My mother... I learned that from her.
A2_SRT_TIM_4500_20	Understanding each other’s feelings...\nThat’s really nice.
A2_SRT_RACHEL_4500_60	Mm-hm!
A2_SRT_YESSAN_4600_10_NOMESSAGE	Deedee! (I’ll fix you up!)
A2_SRT_GRAENA_4600_10_NOMESSAGE	Ena. (Thanks.)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7900_10_NOMESSAGE	*heavy breathing* (crawling exertions)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7900_20_NOMESSAGE	*grunts* (trying to squeeze through)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7900_30	Whoa!
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_7900_40	Ow! Ughhh...
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_1900_5	Bwuh?!
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_1900_10	Looks like I’ve been spotted...
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_1900_20	Come on! There’s no way\nI’m giving up just yet!
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_8100_10	Well, here goes nothing.
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_8100_20	Why are they all so high up?
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_8200_10_NOMESSAGE	*heavy breathing* (crawling exertions)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_8200_20_NOMESSAGE	*grunts* (trying to squeeze through)
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_8200_30	Whoa!
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_8200_40	Owww... I think this is making me shorter.
A2_SRT_PIKACHU_2100_10	Ugh...
A2_SRT_IRENE_2100_10	This was his ring...
A2_SRT_IRENE_2100_20	When your father left,\nhe didn’t take it with him.
A2_SRT_TIM_2100_10	Are you getting...a divorce?
A2_SRT_SOPHIA_2100_10	No way...
A2_SRT_IRENE_2100_30	Don’t worry—we’re not.
A2_SRT_IRENE_2100_40	He may have said that’s\nwhat he wanted...
A2_SRT_IRENE_2100_50	but when he said it, he couldn’t bring\nhimself to look me in the eye.
A2_SRT_IRENE_2100_60	He always does that when\nhe’s hiding something.
A2_SRT_IRENE_2100_80	I’m sure he got involved\nin some sort of incident...
A2_SRT_IRENE_2100_90	So he pushed us away to make sure\nhis family stayed clear of any danger.
A2_SRT_TIM_2100_20	Mom...

A2_V2.asset
A2_V2_PIKACHU_100_10	Hey, Tim! Sorry I kept you waiting.
A2_V2_TIM_100_10	Pikachu!
A2_V2_RACHEL_100_10	You’re OK!
A2_V2_BUTLER_100_10	Impossible... Why are Pikachu\nand Luxray here?
A2_V2_BUTLER_100_20	Detain them already, Brad!
A2_V2_TIM_100_20	Pikachu’s coming home with me.
A2_V2_TIM_100_30	Because the real culprit behind all this...
A2_V2_TIM_100_40	is you, Chief Butler!
A2_V2_BUTLER_100_30	I’m the culprit? Hah! What’s gotten\ninto you all of a sudden?
A2_V2_BUTLER_200_10	Your partner is the one who\ndestroyed the Slowpoke statue.
A2_V2_BUTLER_200_30	You can’t talk your way out of this.
A2_V2_RACHEL_200_10	You’re just playing innocent.
A2_V2_RACHEL_200_20	Tim! Be sure to start off strong.
A2_V2_TIM_300_10	That night, Pikachu was at the\nHi-Hat Café.
A2_V2_TIM_300_20	A witness saw him there drinking coffee.
A2_V2_BUTLER_300_10	I couldn’t care less about that. I have\nirrefutable proof of his guilt!
A2_V2_PIKACHU_400_10	That doesn’t exactly prove\nmy innocence, Tim.
A2_V2_PIKACHU_400_20	Stay calm, and think this through.
A2_V2_BUTLER_500_10	The police have the \nsurveillance camera footage.
A2_V2_BUTLER_500_20	Are you suggesting it’s some\nother Pokémon in that footage?
A2_V2_BUTLER_500_30	It clearly shows YOUR Pikachu\ncommitting the crime!
A2_V2_TIM_600_10	It’s a transformed Ditto.
A2_V2_BUTLER_600_10	A transformed Ditto?
A2_V2_TIM_600_20	A Ditto recently went missing,\nand according to its partner...
A2_V2_TIM_600_30	it’s not great at transforming and can\nonly imitate what it’s able to see.
A2_V2_TIM_600_40	Now look at this.
A2_V2_BUTLER_600_20	Wh-what am I looking at, exactly?
A2_V2_TIM_600_50	There are no stripes on its back—which\nmeans that “Pikachu” is NOT my partner.
A2_V2_PIKACHU_700_10	Hey, c’mon... Are you being serious?
A2_V2_PIKACHU_700_20	There’s a Pokémon that\ncan look almost like me.
A2_V2_BUTLER_800_10	You actually think me and that\nDitto were working together?
A2_V2_BUTLER_800_20	Didn’t you just say that Ditto\nhas a partner of its own?
A2_V2_BUTLER_800_30	If I gave it orders, it wouldn’t\nhave listened to me!
A2_V2_TIM_900_10	The Pokémon in your custody...had\ndevices attached to their backs.
A2_V2_BUTLER_900_10	We put those on in order to manage\nthem. What’s wrong with that?
A2_V2_TIM_900_20	Those devices can be used to\ncompletely control Pokémon.
A2_V2_BUTLER_900_20	What are you... That’s nonsense.
A2_V2_BRAD_900_10	Now that you mention it... When the\ndevices were glowing, the Pokémon\ndid whatever they were told.
A2_V2_BUTLER_900_30	Don’t tell me you believe this!
A2_V2_PIKACHU_1000_10	Hey!
A2_V2_PIKACHU_1000_20	Did you already forget\nwhat happened to me?
A2_V2_BUTLER_1100_10	Of all the... Do you hear\nyourself right now?
A2_V2_BUTLER_1100_20	A device that controls Pokémon?
A2_V2_BUTLER_1100_30	Nonsense. As if something\nlike that could even exist!
A2_V2_BUTLER_1100_40	And even if it did, you have\nno evidence that I used it!
A2_V2_TIM_1200_10	But I do have evidence.
A2_V2_TIM_1200_20	Take a look!
A2_V2_BUTLER_1200_10	How did... How do you have this?!
A2_V2_BUTLER_1200_20	Brad! Was it you?!
A2_V2_BRAD_1200_10	Huh?!
A2_V2_TIM_1200_30	Stop trying to deflect.
A2_V2_TIM_1200_40	These documents were\nfound in your office.
A2_V2_TIM_1200_50	Which means...you were\nin fact using this device!
A2_V2_PIKACHU_1300_10	Hey, c’mon!
A2_V2_PIKACHU_1300_20	That’s not gonna prove that Butler\nwas the one who used the device.
A2_V2_BUTLER_1400_10	Documents? Hah!\nYou’re mistaken, that’s all.
A2_V2_BUTLER_1400_20	I’m the chief of the PPB.
A2_V2_BUTLER_1400_30	I would never do such a thing.
A2_V2_BUTLER_1400_40	I don’t even have a motive!
A2_V2_TIM_1500_10	I’ve discovered your motive.
A2_V2_TIM_1500_20	Look at this.
A2_V2_TIM_1500_30	Unitas provided you with the devices, and\nyou provided them with detained Pokémon...
A2_V2_TIM_1500_40	in exchange for large sums of money.
A2_V2_BUTLER_1500_10	Ergh...
A2_V2_TIM_1500_50	You’re not detaining Pokémon\nhere—you’re kidnapping them!
A2_V2_TIM_1500_60	Well, Chief Butler? Did I miss anything?
A2_V2_PIKACHU_1600_10	Hey! What about that\nevidence I managed to get?
A2_V2_PIKACHU_1600_20	C’mon, think back!
A2_V2_BUTLER_1700_10	Exposed...by this kid...
A2_V2_PIKACHU_1700_10	You never stood a chance\nagainst us, Butler.
A2_V2_RACHEL_1700_10	Wonderful work, Tim.
A2_V2_TIM_1700_5	Thanks.
A2_V2_RACHEL_1700_20	Pikachu, you were amazing too.
A2_V2_PIKACHU_1700_20	I owe you two big time.
A2_V2_TIM_1700_10	Anyway, now you can\nfinally get out of here.
A2_V2_PIKACHU_1700_30	Yeah—and I could really go\nfor some coffee after this.
A2_V2_BRAD_1700_10	That was great detective work, Tim.
A2_V2_BRAD_1700_20	On behalf of the Ryme City Police...\nyou have our sincerest gratitude.
A2_V2_TIM_1700_20	Lieutenant...
A3.asset
A3_0110_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK! Today we’re going to find out more about the\nAurora Drop, right?
A3_0110_TIM_100_1000	Yeah. Rachel said she’d introduce me to a professor\nfrom Ryme University.
A3_0110_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’ve still got a little time before we’re supposed to\nmeet her at the Hi-Hat Café, though.
A3_0110_PIKACHU_100_3000	Your family doesn’t visit that often. Why don’t you\nchat with them a bit before we head out?
A3_0110_TIM_100_2000	Yeah, I know, Pikachu...
A3_0115_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, I see the newspaper’s arrived.
A3_0115_IRENE_100_1000	You subscribe to a newspaper, Tim?
A3_0115_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, it’s Ryme City’s daily paper.
A3_0115_IRENE_100_2000	You never used to read the paper when you lived at\nhome. What changed?
A3_0115_TIM_100_2000	Well...I’m a college student now. I thought I should\nread the newspaper, at least.
A3_0115_SOPHIA_100_1000	Well, aren’t you mature!
A3_0115_PIKACHU_100_2000	What are you doing, Tim? Tryin’ to look cool\nor something?
A3_0115_PIKACHU_100_3000	I’m the one who suggested that you start getting the\nnewspaper, y’know.
A3_0115_PIKACHU_100_4000	As a detective, it’s important to be gathering\ninformation at all times.
A3_0115_IRENE_100_3000	I’m sure there’s a lot going on every day in a city\nas big as this one.
A3_0115_IRENE_100_4000	Checking the newspaper regularly is a good idea.
A3_0115_PIKACHU_100_5000	Your mom knows what she’s talking about, Tim.
A3_0115_PIKACHU_100_6000	So what’re we waiting for? Let’s read that newspaper!
A3_0125_SOPHIA_100_1000	Hee hee! Your Pikachu is so funny!
A3_0125_PIKACHU_100_1000	“Funny”? Not cute?
A3_0125_PIKACHU_100_2000	The way Sophia reacts to stuff is a bit different from\neveryone else...
A3_0130_TIM_100_1000	Good morning, Mom. Did you sleep OK last night?
A3_0130_IRENE_100_1000	Yes, just fine, thanks! You have classes today,\ndon’t you?
A3_0130_TIM_100_2000	I’m actually heading out for an important\ninvestigation this morning.
A3_0130_IRENE_100_2000	Once you’re on a case, it’s all you can think about.
A3_0130_IRENE_100_3000	Just like your father. Good grief!
A3_0130_TIM_100_3000	Oh, Mom—I don’t suppose you’ve heard from Dad\nat all?
A3_0130_IRENE_100_4000	I certainly would have told you if I had.
A3_0130_TIM_100_4000	Yeah, that’s true...
A3_0130_PIKACHU_100_1000	Your wife sure loves you, Harry.
A3_0130_PIKACHU_100_2000	Must be nice.
A3_0130_IRENE_200_1000	I wonder where your father really disappeared to.
A3_0130_TIM_200_1000	I don’t know...but I’m sure Pikachu and I will find him.
A3_0140_PIKACHU_100_1000	Any interesting articles?
A3_0150_TIM_100_1000	The morning news is about to start.
A3_0150_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh yeah? Anything interesting?
A3_0150_TIM_200_1000	Looks like there’s nothing new.
A3_0170_TIM_100_1000	It feels weird to be in the spotlight like this...
A3_0170_PIKACHU_100_1000	They’re saying good things about us! You’re allowed\nto be pleased by that, Tim!
A3_0170_PIKACHU_100_2000	Sounds like the mayor’s gonna give a speech about\nthe Pokémon Friendship bill too.
A3_0170_TIM_100_2000	Mayor Myers is Rachel’s father. I can’t imagine what\nit’s like, having the mayor as your dad.
A3_0180_TIM_100_1000	We should get going.
A3_0180_PIKACHU_100_1000	While we’re out, I wanna buy more coffee beans.
A3_0180_PIKACHU_100_2000	Our supply’s running low.
A3_0180_TIM_100_2000	OK, OK. Your usual dark roast, right?
A3_0185_TIM_100_1000	Anyway, we’re heading out now.
A3_0185_SOPHIA_100_1000	Bye! Have a nice day!
A3_0510_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like they still haven’t found the Aurora Drop.
A3_0510_TIM_100_1000	Inspector Holiday and his team have been searching\nfor the jewel and Cramorant...
A3_0510_PIKACHU_100_2000	But there’s been no progress on either front.
A3_0510_TIM_100_2000	Speaking of Cramorant, he was acting really weird\nthen, wasn’t he?
A3_0510_PIKACHU_100_3000	According to the article, even Turner didn’t know why\nhe acted like that.
A3_0510_TIM_100_3000	So, Turner didn’t order Cramorant to swallow the\njewel and escape...
A3_0510_PIKACHU_100_4000	Hmm... Something’s really fishy about this\nwhole thing.
A3_0610_TIM_100_500	The article’s about a woman who got injured inside\nher house and couldn’t move.
A3_0610_TIM_100_1000	It says her Lillipup went outside and howled to alert\nthe neighbors.
A3_0610_PIKACHU_100_2000	Aww, that’s a sweet story... Hey, wait! Look at\nthis photo!
A3_0610_PIKACHU_100_3000	Isn’t that the woman we met yesterday? The one\nwhose Lillipup ran off?
A3_0610_TIM_100_2000	Let me see... You’re right! We met her in front of the\nDenis residence.
A3_0610_PIKACHU_100_4000	Her Lillipup was a pretty shy little guy who preferred\nquiet places...
A3_0610_TIM_100_3000	Apparently he kept barking and howling until the\nneighbors finally noticed.
A3_0610_PIKACHU_100_5000	I guess he gathered up all his courage to help his\nbeloved partner.
A3_0620_TIM_100_1000	Apparently a new medicine has been developed\nusing Ribombee’s pollen puffs.
A3_0620_PIKACHU_100_1000	Makes sense. Ribombee make lots of different kinds\nof pollen puffs.
A3_0620_PIKACHU_100_2000	I hear their pollen puffs have different effects based\non the flowers the nectar and pollen came from.
A3_0620_PIKACHU_100_3000	I bet how they mix ingredients could be applied to\nhuman medicine too.
A3_0620_TIM_100_2000	I wonder what kind of pollen puffs that Ribombee was\nmaking yesterday.
A3_0620_PIKACHU_100_4000	It might come up with something really surprising...
A3_0620_PIKACHU_100_5000	But first, those little Cutiefly need to learn how to\ngather nectar properly.
A3_0630_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like community soccer clubs have gotten pretty\npopular lately.
A3_0630_TIM_100_1000	Apparently players can participate alongside their\npartner Pokémon.
A3_0630_TIM_100_2000	The article says the crowd goes wild at every match,\nwatching the incredible power of Pokémon and their\nteamwork with their partners.
A3_0630_TIM_100_3000	It’s getting rave reviews from both players and\naudience members.
A3_0630_PIKACHU_100_2000	So that’s why that boy yesterday was looking for a\nPokémon to play soccer with.
A3_0630_TIM_100_4000	Do you think he and Raboot will make a good team?
A3_0630_PIKACHU_100_3000	I’m sure they will. Didn’t you see how much fun they\nwere having practicing together?
A3_0640_TIM_100_1000	I wonder what today’s crossword is like.
A3_0640_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s surprisingly challenging, so I look forward to it\nevery day.
A3_0640_TIM_100_2000	The crosswords are written by readers? Wow...\nI’m impressed by the people who can make these.
A3_0640_PIKACHU_100_2000	OK, Tim! Let’s fill it out!
A3_0640_TIM_100_3000	Let’s see... “This Pokémon catches prey with its\nlong tongue.”
A3_0640_PIKACHU_100_3000	That’d be Lickitung. It’s got the right number of\nletters and everything.
A3_0640_TIM_100_4000	“This Pokémon uses its cute looks to put you off your\nguard so it can steal from you.”
A3_0640_PIKACHU_100_4000	Meowth? No, not enough letters... Purrloin, then?
A3_0640_TIM_100_5000	“This Pokémon always moves together in a well-\ncoordinated group.”
A3_0640_PIKACHU_100_5000	Hmmm... Based on the squares we’ve already filled in,\nI’m guessing this has gotta be Falinks.
A3_0640_TIM_100_6000	Hey, Pikachu...
A3_0640_TIM_100_7000	I feel like we’ve heard these hints before...
A3_0640_PIKACHU_100_6000	Yeah, you’re right. This puzzle must’ve been created\nby a certain quiz professor...
A3_10200_SOLROCK_400_1000	Sol! Sol!
A3_10200_TIM_400_1000	I hope the weather returns to normal soon...
A3_10200_PIKACHU_500_1000	It’s OK now, Solrock.
A3_10200_PIKACHU_500_2000	We’ve solved the case, so the weather should go back\nto normal soon.
A3_10200_SOLROCK_500_1000	Sol soool!
A3_10200_PIKACHU_500_3000	It’ll probably take a little time for the place to warm\nup again.
A3_10200_PIKACHU_500_4000	Hang in there just a little longer, OK?
A3_10200_SOLROCK_500_2000	Sol sol!
A3_10200_SOLROCK_800_1000	Sol sol...
A3_10200_PIKACHU_800_1000	It’s a Solrock.
A3_10200_PIKACHU_800_2000	They say this Pokémon absorbs energy from the sun.
A3_10200_TIM_800_1000	It looks cold...
A3_10200_SOLROCK_800_2000	Sol... Solrock...
A3_10200_PIKACHU_800_3000	Apparently it’s not feeling well because the weather’s\nbeen so bad.
A3_10200_PIKACHU_800_4000	It’s OK now, Solrock.
A3_10200_PIKACHU_800_5000	We’ve solved the case, so the weather should go back\nto normal soon.
A3_10200_SOLROCK_800_3000	Sol soool!
A3_10200_PIKACHU_800_6000	It’ll probably take a little time for the place to warm\nup again.
A3_10200_PIKACHU_800_7000	Hang in there just a little longer, OK?
A3_10200_SOLROCK_800_4000	Sol sol!
A3_1030_PIKACHU_100_1000	You sure we were supposed to meet Rachel in\nfront of the Hi-Hat Café?
A3_1030_TIM_100_1000	Yeah. She should be here by now. I wonder what’s\nkeeping her...
A3_1030_SECRETRACHEL_100_1000	Please, Papa! Just listen to me!
A3_1030_TIM_100_2000	That sounded like Rachel!
A3_10300_METENOSHELL01_200_1000	Or! Minior!
A3_10300_PIKACHU_200_1000	You wanna go back to your home in the sky, huh?
A3_10300_TIM_200_1000	I wonder if there’s a Pokémon around here that could\nbreak its shell.
A3_10300_METENOSHELL01_300_1000	Or! Minior!
A3_10300_TIM_300_1000	Hm? Is this Pokémon trying to tell us something?
A3_10300_PIKACHU_300_1000	Yeah. Minior says it wants to go back home.
A3_10300_TIM_300_2000	Where’s its home?
A3_10300_PIKACHU_300_2000	Minior live up in the ozone layer. They fall down to\nthe ground when their shells get too heavy.
A3_10300_TIM_300_3000	Wow, that high up, huh? If we helped it get rid of its\nshell, do you think it could make it back up there?
A3_10300_PIKACHU_300_3000	I wonder if we can find a Pokémon powerful enough\nto break its shell.
A3_10310_METENOSHELL02_200_1000	Miiini miniii...
A3_10310_PIKACHU_200_1000	It says it’s hungry. We should help it out somehow.
A3_10310_TIM_200_1000	We can send it back to the sky if we find something\npowerful enough to break its shell, right?
A3_10310_METENOSHELL02_300_1000	Mini.
A3_10310_TIM_300_1000	Hm? This Pokémon looks dizzy.
A3_10310_PIKACHU_300_1000	It’s a Minior, a Pokémon that lives in the sky. These\nfellas plummet to the ground if their shells get too\nheavy.
A3_10310_PIKACHU_300_2000	It says there’s not much food for it down here. \nIt wants to go back to the sky.
A3_10310_PIKACHU_300_3000	But its body is too heavy, so it can’t get back there\non its own.
A3_10310_TIM_300_2000	I see... Do you think it could get back up there if we\nhelped it get rid of its shell?
A3_10310_PIKACHU_300_4000	Good question... Only a really powerful Pokémon\ncould break through that shell.
A3_10320_METENOSHELL03_200_1000	Miiini...
A3_10320_PIKACHU_200_1000	Sorry, but there’s nothing we can do.
A3_10320_TIM_200_1000	I hope we can find a Pokémon strong enough to\nbreak through that shell...
A3_10320_METENOSHELL03_300_1000	Mini mini!
A3_10320_PIKACHU_300_1000	Minior’s asking for help.
A3_10320_TIM_300_1000	What’s it saying?
A3_10320_PIKACHU_300_2000	Well, usually this Pokémon lives in the sky, but it fell\nto the ground after its shell got too heavy.
A3_10320_PIKACHU_300_3000	Apparently it’s lonely because it got separated from\nits family.
A3_10320_TIM_300_2000	Poor thing. Do you think it could get back home if we\nhelped it get rid of its shell?
A3_10320_PIKACHU_300_4000	We just need a way to break that shell... It’d be great\nif we could find a Pokémon strong enough to do that.
A3_10400_PY01_200_1000	Cleff! Cleff!
A3_10400_PIKACHU_200_1000	Oh, no need to thank us!
A3_10400_PY01_300_1000	Cleffa!
A3_10400_PIKACHU_300_1000	We found all the Cleffa that were playing hide-and-\nseek for you.
A3_10400_PY01_300_2000	Cleff!
A3_10400_PIKACHU_300_2000	It’s really happy that everyone’s been found.
A3_10400_TIM_300_1000	I’m just glad it’s happy!
A3_10400_PIKACHU_300_3000	You’re about to head out on a trip to a hill that’s\nkinda far away? Ah, ’cause that’s the perfect place to\nwatch the night sky when there are shooting stars!
A3_10400_TIM_300_2000	That sounds wonderful. Have a safe trip!
A3_10400_PY01_300_3000	Cleff! Cleff!
A3_10400_PIKACHU_300_4000	Aww, no need to thank us.
A3_10400_PY01_400_1000	Cleffa!
A3_10400_PIKACHU_400_1000	Just sit tight. We’re still searching for the other Cleffa.
A3_10400_PIKACHU_500_1000	It’s a Cleffa.
A3_10400_PIKACHU_500_2000	You seem to be looking all over the place. What are\nyou up to?
A3_10400_PY01_500_1000	Cleffa! Cleff cleff cleff!
A3_10400_PIKACHU_500_3000	You’re playing hide-and-seek with your friends, but\nyou can’t find them?
A3_10400_TIM_500_1000	It must be hard being the seeker in a huge area\nlike this.
A3_10400_PY01_500_2000	Cleffaaa...
A3_10400_PIKACHU_500_4000	What? Help you search for them?
A3_10400_PIKACHU_500_5000	We’re in the middle of an investigation. We can play\nhide-and-seek with you another time.
A3_10400_PY01_500_3000	Cleff! Cleffa!
A3_10400_PIKACHU_500_6000	You have other plans after this? And at this rate,\nyou’ll be late?
A3_10400_TIM_500_2000	C’mon, we can help it out a little, can’t we?
A3_10400_PIKACHU_500_7000	Yeah, I guess we can keep an eye out while we’re\ninvestigating the place.
A3_10400_PY01_500_4000	Cleffa!
A3_10400_PIKACHU_500_8000	You’ve got three friends to find, eh? Got it. We’ll let\nyou know if we find them.
A3_10420_PIKACHU_200_1000	Found ya! You’re one of the Cleffa playing hide and\nseek, aren’t you?
A3_10420_PY02_200_1000	Cleff?!
A3_10420_PIKACHU_200_2000	Your buddy asked us to help find you.
A3_10420_PY02_200_2000	Cleff...
A3_10420_PIKACHU_200_2500	You thought no one would find you here, eh?
A3_10420_PIKACHU_200_3000	Don’t you have other plans after this? You should\nhead back.
A3_10420_PY02_200_3000	Cleff...
A3_10420_PY02_300_1000	Cleff cleff!
A3_10420_PIKACHU_300_1000	Oh wow, I didn’t expect to find a Cleffa here!
A3_10420_TIM_300_1000	The Cleffa looks pretty surprised to be found too!
A3_10430_PY03_200_1000	Cleffa?!
A3_10430_TIM_200_1000	It’s a Cleffa. I wonder if this is one of the ones\nplaying hide-and-seek.
A3_10430_PIKACHU_200_1000	It was hiding behind the rocks Darmanitan smashed.
A3_10430_TIM_200_2000	Seems like a pretty good hiding spot to me.
A3_10430_PIKACHU_200_2000	I hear you’ve got some other plans after this.\nIt’s time to go meet up with your friend.
A3_10430_PY03_200_2000	Cleff...
A3_10430_PY03_300_1000	Cleffa?!
A3_10430_TIM_300_1000	There’s a Cleffa behind this rock.
A3_10430_PIKACHU_300_1000	How’d it get back there?
A3_10440_PIKACHU_200_1000	Found ya, Cleffa!
A3_10440_PY04_200_1000	Cleff?!
A3_10440_PIKACHU_200_2000	The Cleffa looking for you asked us for help finding\nall of you.
A3_10440_PY04_200_2000	Cleff! Cleff!
A3_10440_PIKACHU_200_3000	You thought no one would find you here?
A3_10440_PIKACHU_200_4000	Don’t underestimate the observational powers of a\ngreat detective!
A3_10440_PIKACHU_200_5000	You’ve got some other plans after this, right? Go on!\nIt’s time to go home!
A3_10440_PY04_200_3000	Cleff cleff...
A3_10440_PY04_300_1000	Cleff! Cleffa!
A3_10440_TIM_300_1000	What’s a Cleffa doing here?
A3_10440_PIKACHU_300_1000	It seems pretty cheerful despite the cold.
A3_10450_TIM_100_1000	That should be the last of the Cleffa we were asked\nto find.
A3_10450_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s go check up on the one who was lookin’ for ’em.
A3_10450_TIM_100_2000	I hope we made it happy.
A3_1050_TIM_100_1000	Is everything OK?
A3_1050_RACHEL_100_1000	...Let’s just go inside.
A3_10500_RINGUMA01_200_1000	Ring! Ursaring!
A3_10500_PIKACHU_200_1000	Ursaring’s friend has been frozen over for so long\nthat it’s totally starving.
A3_10500_PIKACHU_200_2000	Oh, you two are gonna to go gather food\ntogether now?
A3_10500_TIM_200_1000	Be careful!
A3_10500_RINGUMA01_300_1000	Ursa! Ursa!
A3_10500_TIM_300_1000	It seems happy to have its friend back.
A3_10500_RINGUMA01_300_2000	Ursa ursa.
A3_10500_PIKACHU_300_1000	You’ll stick together from now on?\nThat’s probably a good idea.
A3_10500_TIM_300_2000	Friends really ought to stick together.
A3_10500_RINGUMA01_300_3000	Ring! Ursa ursa!
A3_10500_PIKACHU_700_1000	You just sit tight, Ursaring! We’ll bring your friend\nback in no time!
A3_10500_RINGUMA01_700_1000	Ursa!
A3_10500_RINGUMA01_800_1000	Ursa...
A3_10500_PIKACHU_800_1000	Your friend headed toward the ruins, right?
A3_10500_PIKACHU_800_2000	If we find him in there, we’ll let you know.
A3_10500_RINGUMA01_900_1000	Ursaaa... Ursaaa...
A3_10500_PIKACHU_900_1000	You sure don’t look happy, Ursaring.\nIs something wrong?
A3_10500_RINGUMA01_900_2000	Ursa ursa...
A3_10500_PIKACHU_900_2000	You came all this way from a faraway bamboo forest\nwith your Ursaring friend to look for food...
A3_10500_PIKACHU_900_3000	but now your friend has been missing for days?
A3_10500_TIM_900_2000	I can see why it’s worried. Let’s help Ursaring search\nfor its friend.
A3_10500_PIKACHU_900_4000	Yeah. We may be in the middle of an investigation,\nbut I’m worried about that other Ursaring.
A3_10500_PIKACHU_900_5000	Do you have any information that might help\nour search?
A3_10500_RINGUMA01_900_3000	Ursaaa...
A3_10500_PIKACHU_900_6000	The last time you saw your friend, he was headed\ntoward the ruins?
A3_10500_PIKACHU_900_7000	That must be the Ursaring we saw before.
A3_10500_PIKACHU_900_8000	You just sit tight, Ursaring! We’ll bring your friend\nback in no time!
A3_10500_RINGUMA01_900_4000	Ring!
A3_10500_RINGUMA01_1000_1000	Ursa... Ursa...
A3_10500_PIKACHU_1000_1000	Oh, it’s an Ursaring. You don’t see those back in\nRyme City very often.
A3_10500_PIKACHU_1000_2000	You sure don’t look happy, Ursaring.\nIs something wrong?
A3_10500_RINGUMA01_1000_2000	Ursa ursa...
A3_10500_PIKACHU_1000_3000	You came all this way from a faraway bamboo forest\nwith your Ursaring friend to look for food...
A3_10500_PIKACHU_1000_4000	but now your friend has been missing for days?
A3_10500_TIM_1000_1000	I can see why it’s worried. Let’s help Ursaring search\nfor its friend.
A3_10500_PIKACHU_1000_5000	Yeah. We may be in the middle of an investigation,\nbut I’m worried about that other Ursaring.
A3_10500_PIKACHU_1000_6000	Do you have any information that might help\nour search?
A3_10500_RINGUMA01_1000_3000	Ursa...
A3_10500_PIKACHU_1000_7000	The last time you saw your friend, he was headed\ntoward the ruins?
A3_10500_PIKACHU_1000_8000	Sounds like that other Ursaring may be inside, then.
A3_10500_PIKACHU_1000_9000	OK! We’ll let you know if we find your friend!
A3_10500_RINGUMA01_1000_4000	Ursa!
A3_10520_RINGUMA02_100_1000	Ursaaa...
A3_10520_PIKACHU_100_1000	Aww, you’re sorry you worried your friend?
A3_10520_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’m sure they’re just happy to know you’re safe.
A3_10530_PIKACHU_200_1000	Hey, Ursaring! Your friend is looking for you.
A3_10530_RINGUMA02_200_1000	Ursa? Riiing!
A3_10530_PIKACHU_200_2000	You should head back so it can stop worrying.
A3_10530_RINGUMA02_200_2000	Ursa ursa!
A3_10530_PIKACHU_200_3000	Should we go check in with that Ursaring outside the\nruins too?
A3_10530_RINGUMA02_300_1000	Ursasa.
A3_10530_PIKACHU_300_1000	You’re gonna find some food and go back home?\nSounds like a plan. Take care, Ursaring!
A3_10530_PIKACHU_400_1000	You OK, Ursaring?
A3_10530_PIKACHU_400_2000	You were frozen solid!
A3_10530_RINGUMA02_400_1000	Ursa ursa.
A3_10530_PIKACHU_400_3000	Hmm... You saw the door was open, so you came\ninside to look for food?
A3_10530_TIM_400_1000	It must have come inside when the professor opened\nthe door.
A3_10530_RINGUMA02_400_2000	Ursasa.
A3_10530_PIKACHU_400_4000	You don’t remember anything after that, huh?\nThat must be when you got frozen.
A3_10530_PIKACHU_400_5000	I don’t think the ice Pokémon were trying to\nhurt anyone, though.
A3_10530_PIKACHU_400_6000	Think ya can forgive ’em?
A3_10530_RINGUMA02_400_3000	Ursaaa.
A3_10530_PIKACHU_400_7000	Right on. Thanks for understanding.
A3_10530_RINGUMA02_400_4000	Ursasa.
A3_10530_PIKACHU_400_8000	You’re gonna find some food and go back home?\nDon’t push yourself too hard, Ursaring!
A3_10530_SEL_0_4000	Yes
A3_10530_SEL_0_5000	No
A3_10530_PIKACHU_500_1000	OK, let’s go.
A3_10530_PIKACHU_600_1000	That’s OK. We can circle back later whenever you\nfeel like it.
A3_1060_TIM_100_1000	What were you and your dad talking about?
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_1000	The Pokémon Friendship bill.
A3_1060_PIKACHU_100_1000	Ah, they mentioned that on the news. Said it was a\nbill to help Pokémon or something.
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_2000	I happened to read the actual text of the bill in\nPapa’s study the other day...
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_3000	The one phrase that kept popping up throughout the\nwhole thing was “to monitor and manage Pokémon”!
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_4000	It’s pretty much a “friendship” bill in name only.
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_5000	I can’t believe he’d try to deprive Pokémon of their\nfreedom! Papa’s seriously changed...
A3_1060_TIM_100_2000	So you’re against your father’s bill?
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_6000	Pokémon should be able to live freely! They don’t\nneed to be “managed”!
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_7000	Even during the R incident, Pokémon were the victims!\nIt was cruel PEOPLE who were responsible!
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_8000	S...sorry. This isn’t what we’re here to discuss.
A3_1060_TIM_100_3000	This is what you wanted to talk about yesterday,\nisn’t it?
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_9000	I just wanted someone to listen to me... I’m glad I\ncould talk to you about it, Tim.
A3_1060_TIM_100_4000	I’m always happy to lend an ear...but are you sure you\ndon’t need any other help?
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_10000	Yes! I’m fine now, really! Let’s get to the real topic of\nthe day—the jewel!
A3_1060_TIM_100_5000	That’s right. Yesterday, you said you could introduce\nme to a professor from Ryme University.
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_11000	Yes, Professor Gordon. He’s a leading figure in the\nfield of mineral archeology.
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_11500	He researches the connections between minerals and\nancient civilizations.
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_12000	I figured he could probably tell us something about\nthat jewel.
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_13000	Right now, though, he’s conducting research at the\nsouthern ruins. We’ll have to travel quite a ways to\nsee him.
A3_1060_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, those ruins are pretty far from here.
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_14000	Fieldwork is a huge part of mineral archeology. Once\nthe professor sets out, he usually doesn’t come back\nfor several months.
A3_1060_TIM_100_6000	Sounds like we’d better go meet him there, then.
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_15000	Yeah. Who knows how long we’ll be waiting if we just\nstay here.
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_16000	OK! We’d better get going if we want to get there\nbefore sundown!
A3_1060_TIM_100_7000	Huh? You’re coming too, Rachel?
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_17000	I mean, it’s not like you actually know Professor\nGordon. I’m the one taking his class...
A3_1060_RACHEL_100_18000	Besides, I think it’ll be fun to help a great detective\nout with a case!
A3_1060_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hey, this isn’t all fun and games, you know!
A3_10700_HAHAKOMORI_200_1000	Lea leeea lea lea!
A3_10700_PIKACHU_200_1000	It’s telling Swadloon they should bundle up\nfor a while.
A3_10700_TIM_200_1000	Yeah. Stay warm so you don’t catch a cold, OK?
A3_10700_HAHAKOMORI_300_1000	Lea leeea! Lea lea lea!
A3_10700_TIM_300_1000	It looks like both the Swadloon got back safely.
A3_10700_KURUMAYU01_300_1000	Loon! Swadlooo!
A3_10700_PIKACHU_300_1000	It’s thanking us for delivering the leaf clothes.
A3_10700_TIM_300_2000	You’re very welcome.
A3_10700_KURUMAYU02_300_1000	Swadloon! Swadloon!
A3_10700_PIKACHU_300_2000	Glad to see you both look OK.
A3_10700_PIKACHU_300_3000	Now don’t go worrying Leavanny too much, all right?
A3_10700_HAHAKOMORI_400_1000	Leeea lea lea...
A3_10700_PIKACHU_400_1000	Yeah, I know. You’re worried about the Swadloon.
A3_10700_PIKACHU_400_2000	Just wait. We’ll find ’em for you.
A3_10700_HAHAKOMORI_500_1000	Leavan...
A3_10700_PIKACHU_500_1000	It’s a Leavanny.
A3_10700_TIM_500_1000	It looks kinda anxious. Do you think there’s\nsomething wrong?
A3_10700_PIKACHU_500_2000	Hey, Leavanny. Did something bad happen?
A3_10700_HAHAKOMORI_500_2000	Lea... Leava...
A3_10700_PIKACHU_500_3000	I see. It’s worried because some Swadloon still haven’t\ncome home.
A3_10700_PIKACHU_500_4000	Leavanny’s gone looking for them a lot already and\ncan’t find them anywhere.
A3_10700_TIM_500_2000	With how cold it is here, I can see why Leavanny’s\nworried. If we find the Swadloon, let’s tell them to\ncome home.
A3_10700_PIKACHU_500_5000	Good idea. Apparently there are two Swadloon\nmissing.
A3_10700_TIM_500_3000	Two of them... Got it.
A3_10700_PIKACHU_500_6000	OK, Leavanny. Leave those Swadloon to us!
A3_10700_HAHAKOMORI_500_3000	Leavaaa?!
A3_10700_PIKACHU_500_7000	Nah, don’t worry about it! We can look for them while\nwe’re conducting our other investigations.
A3_10700_HAHAKOMORI_500_4000	Leav.
A3_10700_PIKACHU_500_8000	It wants us to deliver these clothes to the Swadloon\nwhen we find them because they’re probably shivering\nin this cold.
A3_10700_TIM_500_4000	These are clothes for Swadloon?
A3_10700_PIKACHU_500_9000	Yeah. Leavanny can use their sticky silk to weave\nclothes out of leaves.
A3_10700_PIKACHU_500_10000	OK, got it, Leavanny. We’ll search for those Swadloon\nand deliver these clothes to them too.
A3_10700_PIKACHU_500_11000	So you just sit tight and stop worrying.
A3_10700_HAHAKOMORI_500_5000	Lea!
A3_10720_PIKACHU_400_1000	It’s a Swadloon!
A3_10720_KURUMAYU01_400_1000	Looon.
A3_10720_PIKACHU_400_2000	Looks like it didn’t go home because it’s too cold\nto move.
A3_10720_TIM_400_1000	Let’s give it the clothes we got from Leavanny.
A3_10720_KURUMAYU01_400_2000	Swadloon!
A3_10720_TIM_400_2000	It looks a lot happier now.
A3_10720_PIKACHU_400_3000	Now you can get back to Leavanny, right?
A3_10720_PIKACHU_400_4000	It seems really worried about you. You should hurry on\nhome, OK?
A3_10720_KURUMAYU01_400_3000	Swadloon.
A3_10720_KURUMAYU01_500_1000	Looon... Swadloon...
A3_10720_TIM_500_1000	This poor Swadloon is all wet! It looks so cold...
A3_10720_PIKACHU_500_1000	It’s no wonder in this weather. Do we have any way to\nhelp warm it up?
A3_10730_PIKACHU_400_1000	There’s a Swadloon!
A3_10730_TIM_400_1000	It looks so cold!
A3_10730_KURUMAYU02_400_1000	Looon.
A3_10730_PIKACHU_400_2000	It’s practically frozen. It must be too cold to walk\nback home.
A3_10730_TIM_400_2000	Quick—let’s give it the clothes that Leavanny\ngave us.
A3_10730_KURUMAYU02_400_2000	Swadloon!
A3_10730_PIKACHU_400_3000	All right! It looks much better now.
A3_10730_TIM_400_3000	Your mother’s worried about you, so you should\nhurry home.
A3_10730_KURUMAYU02_400_3000	Swad! Swadlooooon.
A3_10730_KURUMAYU02_500_1000	Swadlooooon.
A3_10730_TIM_500_1000	That Swadloon looks like it’s freezing! I wish there\nwas something we could do...
A3_10730_PIKACHU_500_1000	Yeah, I’d like to help warm it up somehow...
A3_10740_TIM_100_1000	All right, we found both Swadloon!
A3_10740_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wanna head back now to make sure they made it\nhome safe and sound?
A3_10740_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_10740_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_10740_PIKACHU_200_1000	OK, let’s go.
A3_10740_PIKACHU_300_1000	That’s OK. We can circle back later whenever you\nfeel like it.
A3_10750_TIM_300_1000	All right, we found both Swadloon!
A3_10750_PIKACHU_300_1000	Wanna head back now to make sure they made it\nhome safe and sound?
A3_10750_SEL_0_3000	Yes
A3_10750_SEL_0_4000	No
A3_10750_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK, let’s go.
A3_10750_PIKACHU_500_1000	That’s OK. We can circle back later whenever you\nfeel like it.
A3_10900_TSUBOTSUBO_100_1000	Shuck shuck...
A3_10900_TIM_100_1000	Shuckle looks really cold too.
A3_10900_PIKACHU_100_1000	It says it’s gonna make some really nutritious\njuice now.
A3_10900_TIM_100_2000	Oh, that’s a relief.
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_200_1000	I think you’d make a great assistant! Interested?!
A3_11000_TIM_200_1000	Um, I think I’ll pass...
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_300_1000	So, Detective, have you identified the fluffiest fluffster\naround the ruins?
A3_11000_TIM_300_1000	Yes, of course! The answer is Eldegoss!
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_300_2000	Yes! That’s correct! Didn’t you just want to give it a\nbig hug?
A3_11000_DODEKABASHI_300_1000	Canno!
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_300_3000	By the way, Eldegoss’s cotton is used as a material for\nall sorts of clothing!
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_300_4000	And not only that, the seeds attached to its cotton\nare highly nutritious for Pokémon!
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_300_5000	It really is an amazing Pokémon—not only cute but\nhelpful as well!
A3_11000_PIKACHU_300_1000	*sigh* Cute AND helpful? Is there anything it\ncan’t do?
A3_11000_TIM_300_2000	Our daily lives really are improved by so many\ndifferent Pokémon helping us out.
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_300_6000	Well, that’s it for today’s quiz!
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_300_7000	I hope you’re looking forward to the next time\nwe meet!
A3_11000_DODEKABASHI_300_2000	Canno!
A3_11000_PIKACHU_300_2000	I’ve got a feeling we’re gonna keep running into her...
A3_11000_TIM_300_3000	Yes, well... Please go easy on us, OK?
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_400_1000	What Pokémon is soft and fluffy all over?
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_400_2000	Just find the fluffiest Pokémon around these ruins!
A3_11000_DODEKABASHI_400_1000	Canno.
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_500_1000	Hi, Detective. Judging by the look on your face,\nyou’ve found the answer!
A3_11000_TIM_500_1000	Yep! The answer is Charjabug!
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_500_2000	Exactly! Good job!
A3_11000_DODEKABASHI_500_1000	Canno!
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_500_3000	Charjabug eat fallen leaves and convert them into\nelectricity!
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_500_4000	And they can store that electricity just like a battery!
A3_11000_PIKACHU_500_1000	Seems like they’d be pretty useful Pokémon to have\nin the great outdoors.
A3_11000_TIM_500_2000	If only a certain Pikachu had that talent...
A3_11000_PIKACHU_500_2000	Hey, Tim! You know I can hear you, right?!
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_500_5000	And now for question number three! This is the\nlast one!
A3_11000_DODEKABASHI_500_2000	Canno?
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_500_6000	What Pokémon is soft and fluffy all over?
A3_11000_TIM_500_3000	Wow, that last question is really vague...
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_500_7000	Just find the fluffiest Pokémon around these ruins!
A3_11000_PIKACHU_500_3000	Soft and fluffy, huh? I wonder if anyone could beat\nthis fine fur coat of mine.
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_600_1000	What Pokémon has a blocky body, impressive jaws,\nand will shock you if you touch it?
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_600_2000	Let me know when you find it!
A3_11000_DODEKABASHI_600_1000	Cannooo.
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_700_1000	Oh hello, Detective! Have you figured out the\nanswer?
A3_11000_TIM_700_1000	Yes. It’s Rowlet!
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_700_2000	Bingo! That’s it! Maybe I gave too many hints.
A3_11000_DODEKABASHI_700_1000	Canno!
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_700_3000	Rowlet are nocturnal. During the day, they stay still\nand photosynthesize.
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_700_4000	When they hunt, they silently sneak up on their prey\nand attack it with fierce kicks!
A3_11000_PIKACHU_700_1000	Glad we didn’t meet it at night, then. We might have\nlearned about those sneak attacks the hard way!
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_700_5000	On to question number two!
A3_11000_DODEKABASHI_700_2000	Canno?
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_700_6000	What Pokémon has a blocky body, impressive jaws,\nand will shock you if you touch it?
A3_11000_TIM_700_2000	A blocky body?
A3_11000_TIM_700_3000	Is there really a Pokémon like that?
A3_11000_PIKACHU_700_2000	Maybe it’s an Electric-type Pokémon. I guess we can\nkeep an eye out for it.
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_800_1000	What winged Pokémon has a round body and\nadorable eyes?
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_800_2000	Let me know when you find it!
A3_11000_DODEKABASHI_800_1000	Cannooo.
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_900_1000	We meet again, Detective! Remember me?
A3_11000_DODEKABASHI_900_1000	Canno!
A3_11000_TIM_900_1000	Umm... Who are you again?
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_900_2000	Oh, come on! It’s me—the quiz professor! Now, let’s\nget started on today’s Pokémon quiz!
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_900_3000	Answer with the correct Pokémon, and I’ll give you\nsome fun trivia about that Pokémon as a reward!
A3_11000_PIKACHU_900_1000	She was at the park in Ryme City too...
A3_11000_TIM_900_2000	Umm... We’re actually pretty busy right now—
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_900_4000	OK! Question number one!
A3_11000_DODEKABASHI_900_2000	Canno!
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_900_5000	What winged Pokémon has a round body and\nadorable eyes?
A3_11000_WOMANQUIZ_900_6000	The correct Pokémon can be found close by, so get\nout there and find it!
A3_11000_PIKACHU_900_2000	She’s not listening to us at all.
A3_11000_PIKACHU_900_3000	Well, if we happen to come across the answer, I guess\nwe can tell her.
A3_11020_MOKUROH_400_1000	Rowl! Let!
A3_11020_PIKACHU_400_1000	It thinks we’re acting suspicious.
A3_11020_TIM_400_1000	Don’t worry—we’re just here to investigate the ruins.
A3_11020_PIKACHU_500_1000	It’s a Rowlet.
A3_11020_TIM_500_1000	Hmm, this Pokémon has adorable eyes and a round\nbody...
A3_11020_PIKACHU_500_2000	Just like the quiz professor said.
A3_11020_TIM_500_2000	You think she was talking about this Pokémon?
A3_11020_PIKACHU_500_3000	She must have been.
A3_11020_PIKACHU_500_4000	OK, let’s go back to that professor and tell her what\nwe found.
A3_11020_MOKUROH_500_1000	Rowl?
A3_11020_MOKUROH_600_1000	Rowl... Rowlet!
A3_11020_TIM_600_1000	This sure is a cute Pokémon.
A3_11040_DENDIMUSHI_400_1000	Charja charja...charj?
A3_11040_TIM_400_1000	Is it asking us for something?
A3_11040_PIKACHU_400_1000	I think it’s just...kinda worried in general.
A3_11040_DENDIMUSHI_500_1000	Charj! Charja!
A3_11040_TIM_500_1000	Oh, you look just like what the quiz professor\ndescribed!
A3_11040_PIKACHU_500_1000	Yeah, she must have been talking about Charjabug.
A3_11040_DENDIMUSHI_500_2000	Charja? Charj!
A3_11040_PIKACHU_500_2000	Oh, it’s nothing important. Sorry if we startled you.
A3_11040_PIKACHU_500_3000	Anyway, now that we know the answer, let’s go\ntell her.
A3_11040_DENDIMUSHI_600_1000	Charj! Charja!
A3_11040_TIM_600_1000	What a strangely shaped Pokémon.
A3_11040_PIKACHU_600_1000	Yeah, you don’t see these in Ryme City.
A3_11060_WATASHIRAGA_400_1000	Elde?
A3_11060_TIM_400_1000	Awww, look at that! I almost want to bury my face in\nall that soft-looking fluff.
A3_11060_PIKACHU_400_1000	Hey, Tim! You’ve got a fluffy friend right by your\nside, remember?
A3_11060_PIKACHU_500_1000	It’s Eldegoss.
A3_11060_TIM_500_1000	It’s...really fluffy.
A3_11060_WATASHIRAGA_500_1000	Eldegoss! Elde elde!
A3_11060_PIKACHU_500_2000	That is an impressive amount of fluff.
A3_11060_TIM_500_2000	Eldegoss has got to be the answer to the quiz\nprofessor’s question.
A3_11060_PIKACHU_500_3000	All right, then! Let’s go back and tell her the answer!
A3_11060_WATASHIRAGA_600_1000	Elde! Eldegoss!
A3_11060_TIM_600_1000	That sure is a fluffy Pokémon.
A3_11090_HAMANOLD01_200_1000	I can’t very well dig for fossils with my bare hands!\nHeh, guess I should just head home for the day.
A3_11090_JIGUZAGUMA_200_1000	Zigzag...
A3_11090_PIKACHU_200_1000	If we could just find a Pokémon strong enough to\nbreak rocks...
A3_11090_HAMANOLD01_300_1000	Well, hello there!
A3_11090_TIM_300_1000	Hello. What are you up to all the way out here?
A3_11090_HAMANOLD01_300_2000	I’m a fossil collector. I travel all over the world\nsearching for new additions to my collection.
A3_11090_HAMANOLD01_300_3000	This is my partner, Zigzagoon.
A3_11090_JIGUZAGUMA_300_1000	Zigzag...
A3_11090_TIM_300_2000	Fossils, huh? Do you really think you’ll find\nsome here?
A3_11090_HAMANOLD01_300_4000	Hah! Do you have any idea how incredible these\nruins are?
A3_11090_HAMANOLD01_300_5000	There are countless fossils buried around here, just\nwaiting to be unearthed—and I intend to do just that!
A3_11090_PIKACHU_300_1000	Wow, evidence of an ancient civilization AND fossils?!\nSounds like the kinda place legends are born from.
A3_11090_HAMANOLD01_300_6000	Furthermore, new research has confirmed that the\nconstruction of these ruins coincided with a huge\nmeteor shower.
A3_11090_HAMANOLD01_300_7000	Hundreds of meteorites are said to have fallen from\nthe sky and landed here—yes, here!
A3_11090_HAMANOLD01_300_8000	Truly, these ruins are the stuff of legends!
A3_11090_TIM_300_3000	Well, I hope you’re able to find some fossils.
A3_11090_HAMANOLD01_300_9000	Thank you! Oh, and before I forget: Do you happen\nto know of any Pokémon that are capable of breaking\nthis boulder?
A3_11090_HAMANOLD01_300_10000	There’s something behind it...I can feel it in my bones!\nIt might even be a fossil!
A3_11090_HAMANOLD01_300_11000	My Zigzagoon usually helps me with this sort\nof thing...
A3_11090_HAMANOLD01_300_12000	but the little fella’s poor paws are frozen numb.
A3_11090_HAMANOLD01_300_13000	We don’t want to have trudged all the way out here\nfor our fossil excavation just to be stopped by some\nnippy weather, you know?
A3_11090_TIM_300_4000	Yeah. I wish there was something we could do...
A3_11090_PIKACHU_300_2000	Me too, but it’s not like either of us can bust a big\nboulder like that.
A3_11090_PIKACHU_300_3000	If we could just find a Pokémon strong enough to\nbreak rocks...
A3_11100_PIKACHU_300_1000	Well, I did find that strange rock earlier.
A3_11100_TIM_300_1000	You mean this one?
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_300_2000	*gasp* Is that really Old Amber?!
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_300_3000	This fossil contains the DNA of the dinosaur\nPokémon Aerodactyl!
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_300_4000	It’s a fearsome, ferocious Pokémon that ruled the\nskies in prehistoric times!
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_300_5000	However, this is not what I’ve been searching for.
A3_11100_TIM_300_2000	Guess we gotta keep looking.
A3_11100_PIKACHU_300_2000	I’ll have to search for another fossil with Darmanitan.
A3_11100_JIGUZAGUMA_300_1000	Zig...
A3_11100_PIKACHU_600_1000	Show him the fossil we found, Tim.
A3_11100_TIM_600_1000	Check this out.
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_600_2000	O-oh my goodness—that’s an Armor Fossil!
A3_11100_JIGUZAGUMA_600_1000	Zigzag!
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_600_3000	If you restore this fossil, it’ll become a Pokémon\ncalled Shieldon!
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_600_4000	It’s said to have an incredibly durable face that can\nwithstand even the strongest attacks.
A3_11100_PIKACHU_600_2000	Wow! Guess that fossil we found turned out to be a\npretty amazing Pokémon.
A3_11100_TIM_600_2000	It may look like a plain old rock to us, but the experts\nreally know their stuff.
A3_11100_PIKACHU_900_1000	Do you still have that round rock we found, Tim?
A3_11100_TIM_900_1000	Is this what you’re looking for?
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_900_2000	Well, as I live and breathe! This is a rare and valuable\nSkull Fossil!
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_900_3000	If you restore this fossil, it’ll become a Cranidos!
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_900_4000	It’s said to be tremendously powerful—able to\npulverize anything with just a headbutt!
A3_11100_TIM_900_2000	Sounds like it could be dangerous to have around.
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_900_5000	This particular fossil has been very well preserved...\nHee hee hee...
A3_11100_JIGUZAGUMA_900_1000	Zigzaaa!
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_1100_1000	Now I’ve got both a Skull Fossil and an Armor Fossil!
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_1100_2000	Marvelous! What a tremendous haul! I can present\nthese findings at the next academic conference!
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_1100_3000	This will do wonders to further the progress of all\nresearch into Fossil Pokémon!
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_1100_4000	Don’t worry—I’ll be sure to properly credit you for\nyour contributions. Thanks so much!
A3_11100_JIGUZAGUMA_1100_1000	Zigza!
A3_11100_TIM_1100_1000	He seemed really happy.
A3_11100_PIKACHU_1100_1000	He did! It was worth getting Darmanitan’s help.
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_1200_1000	Oh, that big Pokémon isn’t with you?
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_1200_2000	I really got my hopes up when I saw those huge,\npowerful fists...
A3_11100_PIKACHU_1200_1000	I need Darmanitan to help this guy look for fossils.
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_1300_1000	I asked for your help looking for fossils, back when\nyou were with that really big Pokémon, remember?
A3_11100_PIKACHU_1300_1000	You’re talkin’ to me, right? Yeah, I remember.
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_1300_2000	Did you find anything?
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_1400_1000	I asked for your help looking for fossils, back when\nyou were with that really big Pokémon, remember?
A3_11100_PIKACHU_1400_1000	You’re talkin’ to me, right? Yeah, I remember.
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_1400_2000	Did you find anything?
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_1500_1000	I asked for your help looking for fossils, back when\nyou were with that really big Pokémon, remember?
A3_11100_PIKACHU_1500_1000	You’re talkin’ to me, right? Yeah, I remember.
A3_11100_HAMANOLD01_1500_2000	Did you find anything?
A3_1120_PIKACHU_100_1000	So, it’s only snowing around the ruins. No way\nthat’s normal...
A3_1120_TIM_100_1000	For now, let’s find the professor. He may be\nable to tell us something about all this.
A3_1120_RACHEL_100_1000	Good plan. The ruins are just up this hill. We should\nbe able to find him there.
A3_1120_PIKACHU_100_2000	Just up the hill? OK, let’s go, Tim!
A3_11210_IWAPALACE_100_1000	Ustle! Ustle!
A3_11210_TIM_100_1000	This Pokémon looks really angry.
A3_11210_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah... Darmanitan woke it up earlier with a punch.
A3_11210_PIKACHU_100_2000	Sorry about that, Crustle.
A3_11220_TIM_100_1000	Hm? This rock seems a little different from the others.
A3_11220_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, it’s definitely got a pretty strange shape.\nWhat do you suppose it’s doing here?
A3_1130_RACHEL_100_1000	The ruins are just up the hill...but getting to them\nlooks a little exhausting.
A3_1130_TIM_100_1000	Are you tired, Rachel? Please don’t push yourself\ntoo hard!
A3_1130_RACHEL_100_2000	Don’t worry, I’m fine! Go on ahead, I’ll catch up to\nyou soon!
A3_1140_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Tim, where are you going? We’ve got things to\ndo here!
A3_1180_MOUKAZARU_100_1000	Mon...
A3_1180_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s a Monferno. It probably lives around here.
A3_1180_TIM_100_1000	It doesn’t look too happy.
A3_1180_MOUKAZARU_100_2000	Mon mon...
A3_1180_PIKACHU_100_2000	It doesn’t like how cold it’s gotten so suddenly.
A3_1180_PIKACHU_100_3000	Do you mind if we ask you some questions?
A3_1180_MOUKAZARU_100_3000	Mon?
A3_1180_PIKACHU_200_1000	Can we ask you some questions?
A3_1180_MOUKAZARU_200_1000	Mon mon?
A3_1180_SEL_0_1000	About you, Monferno...
A3_1180_SEL_0_2000	About the snow...
A3_1180_SEL_0_3000	Have you seen Professor Gordon?
A3_1180_SEL_0_4000	About the Berries here...
A3_1180_SEL_0_5000	What are you good at?
A3_1180_PIKACHU_300_1000	Can’t you create fire, Monferno? I’d think that would\nhelp you deal with the cold.
A3_1180_MOUKAZARU_300_1000	Mon...
A3_1180_PIKACHU_300_2000	Oh, it’s so cold that it’s hard to heat up your flame?
A3_1180_MOUKAZARU_300_2000	Mon mon...
A3_1180_PIKACHU_300_3000	It says it might leave this area if this cold continues\nmuch longer.
A3_1180_TIM_300_1000	I guess it prefers warm places. I hope the weather gets\nbetter soon...
A3_1180_PIKACHU_400_1000	Snowfall is pretty rare here, isn’t it?
A3_1180_MOUKAZARU_400_1000	Mon.
A3_1180_PIKACHU_400_2000	This is the first time you’ve seen snow here when it’s\nnot winter?
A3_1180_PIKACHU_400_3000	When did this snow start?
A3_1180_MOUKAZARU_400_2000	Mon! Monferno!
A3_1180_PIKACHU_400_4000	A few days ago, it says—right when some humans\narrived.
A3_1180_PIKACHU_400_5000	Clouds suddenly started to gather above the ruins,\nand then it started to snow.
A3_1180_TIM_400_1000	It’s really strange that the snow is only falling around\nthe ruins.
A3_1180_PIKACHU_400_6000	Yeah. Maybe we’ll learn more if we pay them a visit.
A3_1180_PIKACHU_500_1000	Have you seen any humans around the ruins?
A3_1180_MOUKAZARU_500_1000	Mon!
A3_1180_PIKACHU_500_2000	<color=#F39800FF>You saw some people start a campfire in front of\nthe entrance?</color>
A3_1180_TIM_500_1000	Maybe it saw Chris and the professor setting up camp.
A3_1180_MOUKAZARU_500_2000	Mon mon.
A3_1180_PIKACHU_500_3000	Monferno thinks it’s hilarious how hard those humans\nhad to work just to make a small campfire.
A3_1180_PIKACHU_500_4000	You know, Monferno, humans can’t just create fire like\nyou do.
A3_1180_MOUKAZARU_500_3000	Mon!
A3_1180_PIKACHU_600_1000	Do you know what Berries can be found here?
A3_1180_MOUKAZARU_600_1000	Mon!
A3_1180_PIKACHU_600_2000	It says there are pink Berries growing on the tree it\nalways plays in.
A3_1180_PIKACHU_600_3000	Do you mean the tree right next to you? Is that where\nyou play?
A3_1180_MOUKAZARU_600_2000	Ferno!
A3_1180_PIKACHU_600_4000	Gotcha.
A3_1180_PIKACHU_600_5000	What do the pink Berries taste like?
A3_1180_MOUKAZARU_600_3000	Mon mon!
A3_1180_PIKACHU_600_6000	That sweet, huh? Sounds like you really love ’em.
A3_1180_PIKACHU_600_7000	I like sweet Berries too.
A3_1180_PIKACHU_700_1000	So tell us—what are you good at, particularly?
A3_1180_MOUKAZARU_700_1000	Mon!
A3_1180_PIKACHU_700_2000	<color=#F39800FF>When it comes to spewing fire, no one can beat you?\nYou sound pretty confident of that.</color>
A3_1180_MOUKAZARU_700_2000	Monfeeern!
A3_1180_PIKACHU_700_3000	Whoa! That’s hot!
A3_1180_TIM_700_1000	Heh heh... I guess this chat cheered it up a little.
A3_1200_HASSBOH01_100_1000	Lo! ♪
A3_1200_HASSBOH02_100_1000	Lo lo! ♪
A3_1200_HASSBOH03_100_1000	Lo lo lo! ♪
A3_1200_PIKACHU_100_1000	Those are Lotad. They’re singing so cheerfully!
A3_1200_PIKACHU_100_2000	Sorry to bother you when you’re having so much fun,\nbut do you mind if we ask you some questions?
A3_1200_HASSBOH01_100_2000	Lo?
A3_1200_HASSBOH01_200_1000	Lo?
A3_1200_HASSBOH02_200_1000	Lo lo?
A3_1200_HASSBOH03_200_1000	Lo lo lo?
A3_1200_SEL_0_1000	About you, Lotad...
A3_1200_SEL_0_2000	About this place...
A3_1200_SEL_0_3000	Have you seen Professor Gordon?
A3_1200_SEL_0_4000	About the Berries here...
A3_1200_SEL_0_5000	What are you good at?
A3_1200_PIKACHU_300_1000	You three seem really happy. I take it you’re not\nbothered by the cold?
A3_1200_HASSBOH01_300_1000	Tad! Lo!
A3_1200_PIKACHU_300_2000	They said a little cold snap like this is no problem\nwhen they can sing!
A3_1200_HASSBOH02_300_1000	Tad! Lotad!
A3_1200_PIKACHU_300_3000	They want to hurry up and evolve because it’s their\ndream to dance together.
A3_1200_TIM_300_1000	We should ask Ludicolo at the Hi-Hat Café to join\nthem, then!
A3_1200_PIKACHU_400_1000	Have you three always lived here?
A3_1200_HASSBOH03_400_1000	Lo lo lo!
A3_1200_PIKACHU_400_2000	So you love it here because it’s warm and has plenty\nof food?
A3_1200_TIM_400_1000	It’s a shame the weather’s like this now.
A3_1200_HASSBOH01_400_1000	Looo...
A3_1200_PIKACHU_400_3000	Apparently they’re just fine, but they’re worried about\nthe other Pokémon around here.
A3_1200_PIKACHU_400_4000	I hope the snow stops soon.
A3_1200_PIKACHU_500_1000	Have you seen a human with a Slowpoke\naround here?
A3_1200_HASSBOH01_500_1000	Lo?
A3_1200_HASSBOH02_500_1000	Lotad?
A3_1200_HASSBOH03_500_1000	Lotad lo...
A3_1200_PIKACHU_500_2000	Sounds like they haven’t seen anything because\nthey’ve been here singing this whole time.
A3_1200_PIKACHU_500_3000	Gotcha. Thanks anyway!
A3_1200_PIKACHU_600_1000	What can you tell us about the Berries around here?
A3_1200_HASSBOH01_600_1000	Lo!
A3_1200_PIKACHU_600_2000	You can find two different kinds of Berries right\nby this pond?
A3_1200_TIM_600_1000	They probably fall from the two trees near the pond.
A3_1200_HASSBOH02_600_1000	Lo lo!
A3_1200_PIKACHU_600_3000	One kind is a sour, blue Berry.
A3_1200_HASSBOH03_600_1000	Lotatatad!
A3_1200_PIKACHU_600_4000	And it sounds like the other kind is yellow and has\na sour, spicy flavor.
A3_1200_HASSBOH02_600_2000	Lota! Lota!
A3_1200_PIKACHU_600_5000	Oh no, don’t worry, Lotad! We’re not here to steal\nyour Berries!
A3_1200_PIKACHU_700_1000	What are you particularly good at?
A3_1200_HASSBOH02_700_1000	Lotad!
A3_1200_PIKACHU_700_2000	Singing and swimming, huh?
A3_1200_TIM_700_1000	They’re good swimmers too?
A3_1200_HASSBOH02_700_2000	Lo lo!
A3_1200_PIKACHU_700_3000	<color=#F39800FF>Sometimes they even give rides to the other\nPokémon here.</color>
A3_1200_TIM_700_2000	They do have nice big leaves for that.
A3_1200_TIM_700_3000	I can see how they’d still be able to swim with a\nPokémon hitching a ride on top.
A3_1210_TIM_100_1000	Some red Berries are growing here.
A3_1210_PIKACHU_100_1000	Those look like Haban Berries.
A3_1220_TIM_100_1000	Some pink Berries are growing here.
A3_1220_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, those are Nanab Berries!
A3_1230_TIM_100_1000	Some yellow Berries are growing here.
A3_1230_PIKACHU_100_1000	They must be Pinap Berries.
A3_1235_TIM_100_1000	Some blue Berries are growing here.
A3_1235_PIKACHU_100_1000	I think they’re Yache Berries.
A3_1240_TIM_100_1000	There are some blue Berries growing here.
A3_1240_PIKACHU_100_1000	I think those are Coba Berries.
A3_1250_TIM_100_1000	This is the only tree without any Berries growing on it.
A3_1250_PIKACHU_100_1000	What kinda tree is it, then?
A3_1260_PIKACHU_100_1000	Phew... That was quite a hike...
A3_1260_RACHEL_100_1000	Hey, Tim, there are a lot of Pokémon here that I’ve\nnever seen in the city.
A3_1260_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, same here.
A3_1260_RACHEL_100_2000	But that Ursaring we saw just outside isn’t native\nto this area.
A3_1260_TIM_100_2000	Maybe it came here looking for food.
A3_1260_PIKACHU_100_2000	Say, where is Gordon, anyway?
A3_1260_TIM_100_3000	Huh? It looks like someone’s here.
A3_1260_RACHEL_100_3000	Oh, that’s—
A3_1260_NONAMEJOSHUA_100_1000	Hm?
A3_1280_RACHEL_100_1000	Sorry to interrupt you during your work, Chris.
A3_1280_RACHEL_100_2000	My name is Rachel, and this is Tim. I’m a student of\nProfessor Gordon’s, and Tim here also attends\nRyme University.
A3_1280_JOSHUA_100_1000	Oh, you’re students? What brought you all the way\nout here?
A3_1280_TIM_100_1000	There’s something we want to ask Professor Gordon\nabout. We were hoping to talk to him.
A3_1280_JOSHUA_100_2000	The professor? Oh dear...
A3_1280_JOSHUA_100_3000	He entered the ruins two days ago and, well, as\nyou can see, he hasn’t come back yet.
A3_1280_TIM_100_2000	Huh?!
A3_1280_PIKACHU_100_1000	Whoa, whoa! What’re you sayin’?!
A3_1280_JOSHUA_100_4000	Oh, the professor’s always like this. He is absolutely\nobsessed with his research in the ruins.
A3_1280_JOSHUA_100_5000	I’m pretty sure he’s deep inside them right now with\nhis partner Slowpoke.
A3_1280_JOSHUA_100_6000	As much as I wish I could check on him, there’s some\nkind of trick to opening the door to the ruins.
A3_1280_JOSHUA_100_7000	You have to trip some sort of mechanism to open it,\nbut I can’t figure it out.
A3_1280_JOSHUA_100_8000	He usually makes it back without issue. I’m sure\nhe’s fine.
A3_1280_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hey, in case you haven’t noticed—it’s FREEZING!\nCan you really afford to be so carefree about this?!
A3_1280_PIKACHU_100_3000	I guess we have to figure out how to use the\nmechanism if we want to meet Gordon.
A3_1280_TIM_100_3000	OK, Chris. We’ll go look for Professor Gordon and\nhis Slowpoke.
A3_1280_JOSHUA_100_9000	You? I’m not sure that’s the best idea...
A3_1280_RACHEL_100_3000	Don’t worry. Tim and Pikachu are detectives, famous\nall over Ryme City.
A3_1280_JOSHUA_100_10000	Oh, you’re THAT Tim? The great detective? In that\ncase, I’m a lot less worried.
A3_1280_JOSHUA_100_11000	OK, I’ll leave the search for the professor and\nSlowpoke to you. Just don’t push yourselves too hard.
A3_1280_TIM_100_4000	Right! First, we’ll investigate the entrance to the ruins!
A3_1280_RACHEL_100_4000	I won’t be much help if I’m looking at the same things\nyou are. I’ll go look around the perimeter of the ruins.
A3_1280_TIM_100_5000	Thanks!
A3_1280_PIKACHU_100_4000	OK, let’s start investigating that entrance!
A3_1290_RACHEL_100_1000	The professor has several assistants, but I heard that\nChris is the most skilled.
A3_1290_TIM_100_1000	If even he can’t figure out how to open the door to\nthe ruins, it must be pretty difficult.
A3_1290_RACHEL_100_2000	I believe in you, Tim! Now, let’s figure out the trick to\nopening that door so we can go see the professor!
A3_1300_JOSHUA_100_1000	Thanks again, Tim.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_100_2000	Just let me know if there’s anything I can do to help.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_200_1000	Is there something you wanted to ask?
A3_1300_SEL_0_1000	About you, Chris...
A3_1300_SEL_0_2000	About Professor Gordon...
A3_1300_SEL_0_3000	About the Berries here...
A3_1300_SEL_0_4000	Substitute for a Tamato Berry?
A3_1300_TIM_300_1000	What are you doing here, Chris?
A3_1300_JOSHUA_300_1000	I’m helping with the professor’s research.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_300_2000	I set up camp, search around the outside of the\nruins... Stuff like that.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_300_3000	It’s not uncommon for me to lose contact with the\nprofessor like this.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_300_4000	But if I stop working just because he’s disappeared,\nI’ll get in trouble with him later.
A3_1300_TIM_300_2000	Sounds pretty rough.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_300_5000	Oh, I’m used to it by now.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_300_6000	About all I can do at the moment is cook up some\ncurry and wait for him.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_300_7000	And there are so many Berries growing around here.\nIt’s a great chance to try out different flavors.
A3_1300_PIKACHU_300_1000	I’m not sure if the professor’s too independent, or if\nthis guy’s too easy-going...
A3_1300_PIKACHU_300_2000	But either way, they seem to make a good pair.
A3_1300_TIM_400_1000	Can you tell us what the professor was up to before\nhe disappeared?
A3_1300_JOSHUA_400_1000	Sure. Before he entered the ruins, he spent a lot of\ntime wandering around near the entrance.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_400_2000	Shortly after he went inside, I heard a rumbling,\ngrinding sound.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_400_3000	And when I looked over, the door to the ruins\nhad closed.
A3_1300_TIM_400_2000	Do you have any idea what happened?
A3_1300_JOSHUA_400_4000	Not really. I was busy making curry at the time, so\nI didn’t actually see when the door closed shut.
A3_1300_TIM_400_3000	Gotcha. Thanks for your help.
A3_1300_TIM_500_1000	Do you know anything about the Berry trees that\ngrow around here?
A3_1300_JOSHUA_500_1000	Yeah, I wandered around and explored a bit while\nwaiting for the professor.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_500_2000	There are lots of different Berries here: Haban\nBerries, Nanab Berries, Pinap Berries...
A3_1300_JOSHUA_500_3000	It’s a shame that there aren’t any Tamato Berries,\nthough.
A3_1300_TIM_500_2000	Tamato Berries?
A3_1300_JOSHUA_500_4000	Yeah, they’re<color=#F39800FF> spicy, red Berries</color>. The professor\nloves them.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_500_5000	When I cook for the professor, he always loves any\ndish I’ve flavored with Tamato Berries.
A3_1300_PIKACHU_500_1000	So, he knows just what flavor he likes. Sounds like\nwe’d get along.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_500_6000	Unfortunately, I just used up all of the Tamato Berries\nI brought with me.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_500_7000	See that tree over there with no Berries on it?
A3_1300_JOSHUA_500_8000	It’s actually a Tamato tree. Someone must have picked\nall of the Berries already.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_500_9000	And here I was hoping to add a little more to\nthis curry...
A3_1300_TIM_1000_1000	We need a Tamato Berry. Do you know if there’s\nanything else we can use instead?
A3_1300_TIM_1000_2000	Anything else red and spicy will do, really.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_1000_1000	Red and spicy... Well, I’ve got some curry, an apple,\nand some snacks...
A3_1300_SEL_0_6000	Curry
A3_1300_SEL_0_7000	Apple
A3_1300_SEL_0_8000	Snacks
A3_1300_SEL_0_9000	Let’s change the subject...
A3_1300_TIM_1100_1000	Didn’t you say that you used Tamato Berries in\nthis curry?
A3_1300_JOSHUA_1100_1000	Yes, I always bring some along because they’re the\nprofessor’s favorite.
A3_1300_PIKACHU_1100_1000	Sounds like the flavor’s right, and I guess the color is\npretty red...
A3_1300_TIM_1200_1000	You mean like a regular apple?
A3_1300_JOSHUA_1200_1000	Yeah, I brought some apples to add a little sweetness\nto the curry.
A3_1300_PIKACHU_1200_1000	The color’s right, but not the flavor...
A3_1300_TIM_1300_1000	What sort of snacks do you have?
A3_1300_JOSHUA_1300_1000	Five-Alarm Chips! That spicy flavor is hard to beat.
A3_1300_JOSHUA_1300_2000	But they’re not red...
A3_1300_PIKACHU_1300_1000	Hmm... The flavor’s right, but not the color.
A3_1300_PIKACHU_1400_1000	Anything else you wanna ask?
A3_1310_GONBE_100_1000	Munch munch.
A3_1310_PIKACHU_100_1000	This Munchlax appears to be Chris’s partner.
A3_1310_GONBE_100_2000	Munch!
A3_1310_PIKACHU_100_2000	Ask you anything, huh? Don’t mind if we do!
A3_1310_GONBE_100_3000	Mun!
A3_1310_GONBE_200_1000	Munch?
A3_1310_SEL_0_1000	About you, Munchlax...
A3_1310_SEL_0_2000	About the professor’s Slowpoke...
A3_1310_SEL_0_3000	About Professor Gordon...
A3_1310_SEL_0_4000	About the Pokémon in the tree...
A3_1310_SEL_0_5000	About the Berries here...
A3_1310_SEL_0_6000	What are you good at?
A3_1310_PIKACHU_300_1000	What are you doing here?
A3_1310_GONBE_300_1000	Mun mun.
A3_1310_PIKACHU_300_2000	He says he’s helping Chris.
A3_1310_PIKACHU_300_3000	What sort of help do you do?
A3_1310_GONBE_300_2000	Munch! Munch!
A3_1310_PIKACHU_300_4000	Your job is to eat a lot so there are no leftovers at the\nend of the day?
A3_1310_TIM_300_1000	Sounds like he’s just a glutton...
A3_1310_PIKACHU_400_1000	What’s Gordon’s partner Slowpoke like?
A3_1310_GONBE_400_1000	Mun mun.
A3_1310_PIKACHU_400_2000	It says Slowpoke’s always with the big man.
A3_1310_TIM_400_1000	It must mean Professor Gordon.
A3_1310_GONBE_400_2000	Munch. Mun munch.
A3_1310_PIKACHU_400_3000	Slowpoke is really nice, and he sometimes lets you\neat his tail? And his tail is sweet and delicious?
A3_1310_TIM_400_2000	Seems like Slowpoke is pretty generous.
A3_1310_PIKACHU_500_1000	Do you know what Gordon was doing when he\nentered the ruins?
A3_1310_GONBE_500_1000	Munch munch.
A3_1310_PIKACHU_500_2000	<color=#F39800FF>He was eating something while he investigated\nthe ruins?</color>
A3_1310_PIKACHU_500_3000	He must’ve been in quite a hurry if he was snacking\nand researching at the same time. What did Gordon\ndo after that?
A3_1310_GONBE_500_2000	Munch munch.
A3_1310_PIKACHU_500_4000	He was moving around strangely near the entrance?
A3_1310_PIKACHU_500_5000	And he was acting so weird, a Pokémon up in a tree\nstarted laughing at him?
A3_1310_TIM_500_1000	So it wasn’t just Munchlax and Chris that were\nwatching the professor—that Pokémon saw him too!
A3_1310_PIKACHU_500_6000	What happened after that?
A3_1310_GONBE_500_3000	Munch munch.
A3_1310_PIKACHU_500_7000	The next thing he knew, Gordon was gone.
A3_1310_TIM_500_2000	Let’s ask him more about that other Pokémon.
A3_1310_PIKACHU_600_1000	Right. Munchlax, you said there was a Pokémon\nwatching Gordon from up in a tree. What kind\nof Pokémon was it?
A3_1310_GONBE_600_1000	Laaax.
A3_1310_PIKACHU_600_2000	You don’t know ’cause you’d never seen that kind\nof Pokémon before, huh?
A3_1310_PIKACHU_600_3000	Where did it go?
A3_1310_GONBE_600_2000	Munchlax!
A3_1310_PIKACHU_600_4000	He says it disappeared down that path to the left.
A3_1310_TIM_600_1000	It’s always better to hear what each Pokémon has to\nsay. Let’s make sure we’ve talked to them all.
A3_1310_PIKACHU_700_1000	Do you know anything about the Berries that can be\npicked around here?
A3_1310_GONBE_700_1000	Muncha...
A3_1310_PIKACHU_700_2000	Munchlax found a blue Berry nearby, but he says it\nwas bitter and not tasty at all.
A3_1310_PIKACHU_700_3000	You wish you could find sweet Berries instead, huh?
A3_1310_TIM_700_1000	Hmm... So you can find bitter, blue Berries around\nhere.
A3_1310_PIKACHU_800_1000	What sort of things are you good at?
A3_1310_GONBE_800_1000	Munchlax!
A3_1310_PIKACHU_800_2000	He says he can clean up pots and plates until they’re\nspotless and sparkling.
A3_1310_TIM_800_1000	He washes dishes? That’s really helpful.
A3_1310_GONBE_800_2000	Mun muncha. Munchlax!
A3_1310_PIKACHU_800_3000	And by “clean up,” he means <color=#F39800FF>he eats every last scrap\nof food until the pots and plates are spotless</color>.
A3_1310_PIKACHU_800_4000	Sounds like that’s a point of pride for Munchlax.
A3_1310_TIM_800_2000	Oh, so it doesn’t wash dishes after all... It just really\nloves eating.
A3_1320_TIM_100_1000	What do you suppose grows on this tree?
A3_1320_TIM_200_1000	There are some yellow Berries growing here.
A3_1320_PIKACHU_200_1000	Those have gotta be Shuca Berries.
A3_1340_PIKACHU_100_1000	Whoa! A Passimian was in this tree?!
A3_1340_NAGETUKESARU_100_1000	Simi!
A3_1340_PIKACHU_100_2000	We woke you up from your nap? Sorry about that.
A3_1340_NAGETUKESARU_100_2000	Pass pass.
A3_1340_PIKACHU_100_3000	It’s been noisy around here lately because of all of\nthe strange visitors?
A3_1340_TIM_100_1000	Is it talking about the professor and Chris?
A3_1340_PIKACHU_100_4000	Maybe. Let’s ask for more details.
A3_1340_NAGETUKESARU_100_3000	Pass?
A3_1340_NAGETUKESARU_200_1000	Passi?
A3_1340_SEL_0_1000	About you, Passimian...
A3_1340_SEL_0_2000	About the ruins...
A3_1340_SEL_0_3000	About Professor Gordon...
A3_1340_SEL_0_4000	About the Berries here...
A3_1340_SEL_0_5000	What are you good at?
A3_1340_PIKACHU_300_1000	Do you live here, Passimian?
A3_1340_NAGETUKESARU_300_1000	Simi!
A3_1340_PIKACHU_300_2000	Apparently Passimian and its troop have lived here a\nlong time.
A3_1340_PIKACHU_300_3000	It says they never have to worry about food because\nso many Berries grow around here.
A3_1340_TIM_300_1000	So this is a pretty easy place to live, I guess.
A3_1340_NAGETUKESARU_400_1000	Passi!
A3_1340_PIKACHU_400_1000	It says it’s been seeing humans around here recently.
A3_1340_PIKACHU_400_2000	Recently? Were there no humans here before?
A3_1340_NAGETUKESARU_400_2000	Pass pass.
A3_1340_PIKACHU_400_3000	Humans used to live here a long time ago, but now\nthey’re a rare sight.
A3_1340_PIKACHU_400_4000	And it only knew that humans used to live here\nbecause that’s what its grandfather told it.
A3_1340_TIM_400_1000	If humans once lived here, it must have been a really\nlong time ago.
A3_1340_PIKACHU_500_1000	Did you see a human around here with a Slowpoke?
A3_1340_NAGETUKESARU_500_1000	Pass. Passi!
A3_1340_PIKACHU_500_2000	You saw a human doing something in front of the\nruins while you were up in the tree?
A3_1340_PIKACHU_500_3000	What was he doing, the human?
A3_1340_NAGETUKESARU_500_2000	Pass pass!
A3_1340_PIKACHU_500_4000	He was trying to lift Slowpoke up in front of\nthe door...
A3_1340_PIKACHU_500_5000	<color=#F39800FF>But Slowpoke was too heavy to lift, so the human\nstarted climbing up a tree instead.</color>
A3_1340_PIKACHU_500_6000	Passimian also says it was laughing its head off\nwatching them.
A3_1340_TIM_500_2000	The professor climbed a tree? What in the world was\nhe up to?
A3_1340_PIKACHU_600_1000	What kind of Berries can you find around here?
A3_1340_NAGETUKESARU_600_1000	Pass.
A3_1340_PIKACHU_600_2000	You can pick sweet, yellow Berries from the tree you\nlive in?
A3_1340_PIKACHU_600_3000	So that’s why you like this tree.
A3_1340_TIM_600_1000	Sweet, yellow Berries, eh?
A3_1340_NAGETUKESARU_600_2000	Pass pass!
A3_1340_PIKACHU_600_4000	It says you can have some if you want.
A3_1340_TIM_600_2000	Thanks. If we need any, we’ll let you know.
A3_1340_PIKACHU_700_1000	Do you have any handy skills?
A3_1340_NAGETUKESARU_700_1000	Simi.
A3_1340_PIKACHU_700_2000	<color=#F39800FF>Apparently it’s really good at throwing Berries.</color>
A3_1340_NAGETUKESARU_700_2000	Pass passi!
A3_1340_PIKACHU_700_3000	It says it often competes with its friends to see who\ncan throw the farthest.
A3_1340_TIM_700_1000	So its friends are also its rivals.
A3_1360_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK! Let’s take a good close look and figure out what\nsort of mechanism we’re working with!
A3_1360_PIKACHU_100_2000	Careful not to miss any details!
A3_1360_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, I know.
A3_1370_PIKACHU_100_1000	Is there anything you’re still curious about?
A3_1380_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s see... Where should we look first...
A3_1380_PIKACHU_200_1000	Is there anywhere you’ve forgotten to look?
A3_1390_PIKACHU_5000_1000	Don’t you think we oughta look around here a\nlittle more?
A3_1400_PIKACHU_100_1000	Investigating ancient ruins feels\nlike a real adventure, doesn’t it?
A3_1410_TIM_100_1000	There’s some sort of picture on the door.
A3_1410_PIKACHU_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>Yeah. Must be some kinda relief.</color>
A3_1410_TIM_100_2000	It looks like a person holding up a Pokémon.
A3_1410_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, it does. Do you think it’s a clue about\nthe mechanism?
A3_1420_TIM_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>This tile right here has a design carved into it.</color>
A3_1420_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hmm... What do you suppose this design means?
A3_1420_TIM_100_2000	I have no idea. I’m not an archeologist...
A3_1420_PIKACHU_100_2000	Fair enough. It might have meant something to\nGordon, though.
A3_1420_TIM_100_3000	Hmm, I wonder...
A3_1430_TIM_100_1000	Snow is piled up above the door. Looks like quite\na lot has fallen.
A3_1430_PIKACHU_100_1000	We did hear that it’s been snowing for several days\nstraight. I hope we figure out what caused that.
A3_1435_TIM_100_1000	They’re faint, but I see some footprints on this tree.
A3_1435_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hmm... Judging by the shape, I’d say these are\nhuman. Not sure if they’re Gordon’s, though.
A3_1435_TIM_100_2000	Someone must have climbed this tree. But why would\nthey do that?
A3_1450_TIM_100_1000	I think that’s just about everything!
A3_1450_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. I think we’ve seen enough here.
A3_1460_TIM_100_1000	I think we’ve checked everything that stands out.
A3_1460_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, we just gave the place a quick glance, but I\nthink we’ve got plenty to work with now.
A3_1470_TIM_100_1000	Well, we looked all around the door, but we still don’t\nknow how to open it.
A3_1470_PIKACHU_100_1000	It looks like Chris was right—it won’t open unless we\nactivate some sort of mechanism.
A3_1473_TIM_100_1000	I’m really curious about what Passimian told us.
A3_1473_PIKACHU_100_1000	You mean about Gordon climbing a tree before\nhe entered the ruins?
A3_1473_PIKACHU_100_2000	He must have had a reason...
A3_1473_TIM_100_2000	Passimian also said the professor tried to lift\nup Slowpoke, right?
A3_1473_TIM_100_3000	And remember—the relief on the door also depicted\nsomeone holding up a Pokémon.
A3_1473_TIM_100_4000	Do you think there’s something on top of the door?
A3_1473_PIKACHU_100_3000	It sure sounds possible. Let’s go look up there!
A3_1477_TIM_100_1000	What did you see on top of the door?
A3_1477_PIKACHU_100_1000	There was a tile with the same design as the one on\nthe ground by the door.
A3_1477_TIM_100_2000	The same design?
A3_1477_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s think back over what we know.
A3_1477_PIKACHU_100_3000	Gordon climbed the tree before entering the ruins.
A3_1477_TIM_100_3000	Yeah. It must have been to open the door.
A3_1477_PIKACHU_100_4000	Right. So there’s gotta be some sort of key or switch\nto open it.
A3_1477_PIKACHU_100_5000	Have we seen anything that fits that description?
A3_1477_TIM_100_4000	Let’s see... Something like a key or a switch...
A3_1477_SEL_0_1000	The tile with a unique design.
A3_1477_SEL_0_2000	The door
A3_1477_SEL_0_3000	Munchlax
A3_1477_TIM_300_1000	It’s gotta be that tile with the unique design. I could\nsee that being a switch to open the door.
A3_1477_PIKACHU_300_1000	Right. I think that’s pretty likely.
A3_1477_TIM_300_2000	OK, I’ll try stepping on it.
A3_1477_TIM_300_3000	Ah! I felt something! It sank down a bit when I\npressed on it!
A3_1477_PIKACHU_300_2000	It’s definitely a switch, then—but the door still\ndidn’t budge.
A3_1477_PIKACHU_300_3000	There must be some other way to open it. Try to\ndeduce how, Tim.
A3_1477_TIM_400_1000	I’m really curious about the door itself. It’s got a\nrelief of a human and a Pokémon on it.
A3_1477_PIKACHU_400_1000	It might mean something, but that doesn’t make it\na key.
A3_1477_PIKACHU_400_2000	I think the relief is a clue about how to open the door.
A3_1477_PIKACHU_400_3000	Maybe it’s telling us there’s something on top of the\ndoor, y’know?
A3_1477_TIM_400_2000	I see... So the key must be somewhere else.
A3_1477_TIM_500_1000	Do you think Munchlax could be the key?
A3_1477_PIKACHU_500_1000	Uhhh... Do YOU?
A3_1477_TIM_500_2000	I don’t know, I thought he might have some special\npower or something.
A3_1477_PIKACHU_500_2000	Not unless you count his appetite.
A3_1477_TIM_500_3000	Right... Sorry, I guess I was overthinking it.
A3_1500_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, let’s press both switches at once!
A3_1500_PIKACHU_100_2000	You can press the one down here, Tim. I’ll get the\none up top!
A3_1500_TIM_100_1000	Thanks, Pikachu!
A3_1500_PIKACHU_100_3000	Umm... I know I volunteered, but climbing trees is\nactually pretty tough.
A3_1520_PIKACHU_100_1000	All right, now we can get inside!
A3_1520_TIM_100_1000	Let’s go find the professor!
A3_1530_RACHEL_100_1000	Now all we have to do is find the professor!
A3_1530_RACHEL_100_2000	He’s apparently been in there for two days already...\nI sure hope he’s OK.
A3_1540_JOSHUA_100_1000	Oh, Tim! I see you opened the door to the ruins!
A3_1540_TIM_100_1000	We’re hoping to find both the professor\nand Slowpoke.
A3_1540_JOSHUA_100_2000	Thanks, I really appreciate that. I’ll stay out here and\ntend to the curry!
A3_1610_TIM_100_1000	So this is what the ruins are like inside...
A3_1610_RACHEL_100_1000	Why is it so cold?!
A3_1610_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, it’s freezing in here too. What’s going on?
A3_1610_TIM_100_2000	I know it’s snowing outside, but this still feels really\nunnatural...
A3_1610_PIKACHU_100_2000	Snow outside, ice inside... I bet there’s a connection.
A3_1610_RACHEL_100_2000	Do you think the professor’s all right after two whole\ndays in here?
A3_1610_TIM_100_3000	I hope so. We should probably hurry.
A3_1610_TIM_100_4000	I’m not sure what we’ll find in here, so I’ll go\nscout ahead.
A3_1610_RACHEL_100_3000	Thanks, Tim.
A3_1610_PIKACHU_100_3000	OK, let’s go find Gordon!
A3_1620_RACHEL_100_1000	I didn’t expect it to be like this even inside the ruins...
A3_1620_RACHEL_100_2000	I’m worried about the professor... We need to hurry\nand find him!
A3_1640_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like there are three different ways to go.
A3_1640_TIM_100_1000	Which way do you think the professor went?
A3_1645_TIM_100_1000	Hm? There’s something on the floor.
A3_1645_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a brand-new handkerchief.
A3_1645_TIM_100_2000	Hm? “Trevor...Gordon”?
A3_1645_TIM_100_3000	Professor Gordon’s name is embroidered on it!
A3_1645_PIKACHU_100_2000	So it’s <color=#F39800FF>Gordon’s handkerchief</color>, eh?
A3_1650_TIM_100_1000	This looks like a <color=#F39800FF>statue of Passimian</color>.
A3_1650_PIKACHU_100_1000	What a weird pose. It’s almost like it’s\noffering something.
A3_1650_TIM_100_2000	Yeah, now that you mention it, that is strange.\nI wonder if there’s some special meaning to it.
A3_1650_PIKACHU_100_2000	Also...this statue has a slight scent to it.
A3_1650_TIM_100_3000	Really? I don’t smell anything.
A3_1650_PIKACHU_100_3000	That’s because Pokémon are more sensitive to smell.
A3_1650_PIKACHU_100_4000	It’s faint, but I can smell something sweet.
A3_1650_TIM_200_1000	It’s a Passimian statue.
A3_1650_PIKACHU_200_1000	*sniff sniff* There’s a sweet smell coming from\nthis statue.
A3_1660_TIM_100_1000	This looks like a <color=#F39800FF>statue of Passimian</color>.
A3_1660_PIKACHU_100_1000	What a weird pose. It’s almost like it’s\noffering something.
A3_1660_TIM_100_2000	Yeah, now that you mention it, that is strange.\nI wonder if there’s some special meaning to it.
A3_1660_PIKACHU_100_2000	Also...this statue has a slight scent to it.
A3_1660_TIM_100_3000	Really? I don’t smell anything.
A3_1660_PIKACHU_100_3000	That’s because Pokémon are more sensitive to smell.
A3_1660_PIKACHU_100_4000	This smells spicy. Just sniffing it makes my eyes sting.
A3_1660_TIM_200_1000	It’s a Passimian statue.
A3_1660_PIKACHU_200_1000	Sniffing this statue makes my eyes hurt.
A3_1660_PIKACHU_200_2000	You know, like when you take a big whiff of\nsomething spicy?
A3_1670_TIM_100_1000	This looks like a <color=#F39800FF>statue of Passimian</color>.
A3_1670_PIKACHU_100_1000	What a weird pose. It’s almost like it’s\noffering something.
A3_1670_TIM_100_2000	Yeah, now that you mention it, that is strange.\nI wonder if there’s some special meaning to it.
A3_1670_PIKACHU_100_2000	Also...this statue has a slight scent to it.
A3_1670_TIM_100_3000	Really? I don’t smell anything.
A3_1670_PIKACHU_100_3000	That’s because Pokémon are more sensitive to smell.
A3_1670_PIKACHU_100_4000	Now that I’m closer to it, I smell something sour.
A3_1670_TIM_200_1000	It’s a Passimian statue.
A3_1670_PIKACHU_200_1000	There’s a sour smell coming from this statue.
A3_1680_TIM_100_1000	This wall looks different from the others.
A3_1680_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. There’s a relief of Aegislash carved into it.
A3_1680_PIKACHU_100_2000	What in the world could it mean?
A3_1680_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hm? Hey, Tim! Look at the floor!
A3_1680_TIM_100_2000	What? What about it?
A3_1680_PIKACHU_200_1000	The front of this footprint is cut off by the wall.
A3_1680_TIM_200_1000	How could these footprints have gotten here?
A3_1685_TIM_100_1000	They look like human footprints. From the size,\nI’d guess they were made by an adult male.
A3_1685_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hmm... You’re right.
A3_1685_TIM_100_2000	But there’s something weird about these footprints.
A3_1685_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’ll say. <color=#F39800FF>The tip of the last footprint is cut off by\nthe wall.</color>
A3_1685_TIM_100_3000	It’s almost like the wall was made after the footprints\nwere left here.
A3_1685_PIKACHU_100_3000	That doesn’t seem possible, though, does it?\nWhat could have happened here?
A3_1690_TIM_100_1000	There are footprints all over the floor.\n<color=#F39800FF>It looks like someone was walking all around.</color>
A3_1690_PIKACHU_100_1000	Some seem to be heading toward that wall, and\nothers look like they’re leaving the room.
A3_1690_PIKACHU_100_2000	Gordon must have gone in and out of this room\nseveral times.
A3_1690_TIM_100_2000	There are so many footprints all over the place,\nI can’t tell which way the professor went.
A3_1700_TIM_100_1000	These must be the professor’s footprints.
A3_1700_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, it looks like Gordon walked all over this room.
A3_1720_TIM_100_1000	This is the only spot where the snow is piled up\nlike this.
A3_1720_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s a hole in the ceiling. Must’ve blown in\nfrom there.
A3_1720_TIM_100_2000	You’re right. No wonder it’s so cold.
A3_1720_TIM_100_3000	Wait... Does that mean we could’ve just gotten in\nthrough the ceiling?
A3_1720_PIKACHU_100_2000	Don’t look at me—I didn’t see it when I was up there!
A3_1720_PIKACHU_100_3000	Besides, it would’ve been really tough to get down\nthrough that hole safely.
A3_1720_TIM_100_4000	True. It’s not like we brought a rope or anything...
A3_1730_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a wall of ice. Looks like we can’t go any farther\nthis way.
A3_1730_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, there’s no way we can get through a wall\nthis thick.
A3_1730_TIM_100_2000	I can just barely see through to the other side,\nthough.
A3_1730_PIKACHU_100_2000	Really? Let me take a look...
A3_1730_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hmm... Yeah, there’s definitely something there.
A3_1750_TIM_100_1000	I wonder what that flickering shadow on the other\nside of the wall is.
A3_1750_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s no way for us to check with all this ice\nin the way.
A3_1750_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s investigate somewhere else for now.
A3_1755_TIM_100_1000	That’s a pretty huge hunk of ice.
A3_1755_PIKACHU_100_1000	I know it’s cold in here and all, but could something\nlike that really have formed naturally?
A3_1755_PIKACHU_100_2000	Seems kinda suspicious...
A3_1770_TIM_100_1000	Is this the professor’s partner Slowpoke?
A3_1770_YADON_100_1000	Slow! Slowpoke!
A3_1770_PIKACHU_100_1000	Easy there, Slowpoke. We’re not your partner.
A3_1770_YADON_100_2000	Slow? Slooow...
A3_1770_PIKACHU_100_2000	He thought “Mr. Go” was back, and now he’s\ndisappointed.
A3_1770_TIM_100_2000	He calls Professor Gordon “Mr. Go,” huh?\nThat’s cute.
A3_1770_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hey, Tim!
A3_1770_PIKACHU_100_4000	Looks like his feet are frozen solid. I think he’s stuck.
A3_1770_TIM_100_3000	Yeah. We can’t leave him like this.
A3_1770_PIKACHU_100_5000	But what can we do to help?
A3_1770_TIM_100_4000	Hmm... What if we ask Rachel for help, and then we\ntry pulling him out together?
A3_1770_PIKACHU_100_6000	Sounds like a plan.
A3_1770_TIM_100_5000	This is Professor Gordon’s Slowpoke, right?
A3_1770_RACHEL_100_1000	Yeah, I think so!
A3_1770_RACHEL_100_2000	But why’s he frozen? We’ve gotta help him, quick!
A3_1770_PIKACHU_100_7000	It won’t be easy with ice this solid.
A3_1790_YADON_100_1000	Slow.
A3_1790_RACHEL_100_1000	Looks like we managed to get him free.\nThank goodness!
A3_1790_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says thank you for rescuing him.
A3_1790_TIM_100_2000	I’m really glad we could help! Though you’re heavier\nthan you look...
A3_1790_TIM_100_2333	Did Slowpoke give you his tail just now, Pikachu?
A3_1790_PIKACHU_100_1333	Yeah! Don’t you know Slowpoke tails are good eats?
A3_1790_PIKACHU_100_1666	You can’t help but smile when you sink your teeth\ninto one.
A3_1790_TIM_100_2666	Huh. You don’t say.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_100_2000	How’d you end up frozen, anyway?
A3_1790_YADON_100_2000	Slooow?
A3_1790_PIKACHU_100_3000	It happened so suddenly that you’re not sure?
A3_1790_PIKACHU_100_4000	What about your partner, Gordon? Where’s he?
A3_1790_YADON_100_3000	Slooow...
A3_1790_PIKACHU_100_5000	You were asleep until just now, so you don’t know?
A3_1790_TIM_100_3000	I wish I was that carefree!
A3_1790_PIKACHU_100_6000	Hmmm... Well, that’s too bad.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_100_7000	So then, what DO you remember, Slowpoke? Can you\ntell us anything at all?
A3_1790_YADON_100_4000	Slow slow.
A3_1790_SEL_0_1000	About you, Slowpoke...
A3_1790_SEL_0_2000	Why were you frozen?
A3_1790_SEL_0_3000	Where did Professor Gordon go?
A3_1790_SEL_0_4000	What did Professor Gordon notice?
A3_1790_PIKACHU_300_1000	Just to confirm—you’re Gordon’s partner, right?
A3_1790_YADON_300_1000	Slow! Slowpoooke!
A3_1790_PIKACHU_300_2000	Just as we thought. So you came here to help with\nGordon’s research.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_300_3000	And he always brings you along on all his research\ntrips, eh?
A3_1790_YADON_300_1666	Slow slow.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_300_4000	What sort of things do you do to help the professor?
A3_1790_YADON_300_2333	Slooow.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_300_5000	<color=#F39800FF>You’re good at spraying water</color>, eh? Hmm...\nHow is that helpful to Gordon?
A3_1790_YADON_300_3000	Slow slow!
A3_1790_PIKACHU_300_6000	Ah, I see. Gordon brings you along instead of\nbringing a canteen.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_300_7000	That’s...a choice.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_400_1000	Can you tell us what happened when you got frozen?
A3_1790_YADON_400_1000	Slooow...
A3_1790_PIKACHU_400_2000	Apparently it happened so suddenly, he was already\nfrozen by the time he noticed anything was wrong.
A3_1790_TIM_400_1000	What was the professor up to when you got frozen?
A3_1790_YADON_400_2000	Slooow...
A3_1790_PIKACHU_400_3000	He says that Gordon had gone off somewhere.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_400_4000	And when Slowpoke tried to follow, that’s when he\ngot frozen.
A3_1790_YADON_400_3000	Slow slow.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_400_5000	He says he sat here wondering what to do until he\nfell asleep.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_400_6000	Hard to believe he managed to sleep for two days in\na place this cold.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_500_1000	Was Gordon with you when you entered this room?
A3_1790_YADON_500_1000	Slow.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_500_2000	OK, so they were together at that point.
A3_1790_TIM_500_1000	When did you and the professor get separated?
A3_1790_YADON_500_2000	Slooow! Slowpoooke!
A3_1790_PIKACHU_500_3000	Right after they reached this room.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_500_4000	Gordon told Slowpoke to use his water to wash the\ndust off a mural.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_500_5000	After Slowpoke did that, Gordon suddenly noticed\nsomething and rushed outta the room.
A3_1790_YADON_500_3000	Sloow. Slo slooow.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_500_6000	A bit later, he heard Gordon call out in surprise from\nthe next room.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_500_7000	And then there was a rumbling, rocky sound.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_500_8000	Slowpoke tried to hurry and catch up, but that’s when\nhe got frozen.
A3_1790_YADON_500_4000	Slow!
A3_1790_PIKACHU_500_9000	And right after you got frozen, you heard that\nrumble again?
A3_1790_YADON_500_5000	Slow.
A3_1790_PIKACHU_500_10000	So you heard that rumbling sound twice,\neh, Slowpoke?
A3_1790_PIKACHU_600_1000	Do you have any idea what Gordon might\nhave noticed?
A3_1790_YADON_600_1000	Slooow...
A3_1790_PIKACHU_600_2000	No dice, huh?
A3_1790_TIM_600_1000	The murals in this room are really big...
A3_1790_PIKACHU_600_3000	Yeah. I bet there’s a clue hidden somewhere in\nthese murals.
A3_1800_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thanks for all the info, Slowpoke. You’ve been a\nhuge help.
A3_1800_YADON_100_1000	Slooow.
A3_1800_RACHEL_100_250	That conversation just sounded like a bunch of\n“pika pikas” and “slow slooows” to me.
A3_1800_RACHEL_100_500	Still, they talked for a pretty long time.
A3_1800_RACHEL_100_750	What were they talking about? Could you understand\nthem, Tim?
A3_1800_TIM_100_500	Wh-wha—?! No! Of course I can’t...understand them!
A3_1800_RACHEL_100_1000	All right, then. I’m gonna stay here for a while and\nlook after Slowpoke.
A3_1800_RACHEL_100_2000	I want to at least make sure he’s OK—he was stuck\nin that ice for two days, after all!
A3_1800_TIM_100_1000	Got it. Thanks, Rachel.
A3_1800_PIKACHU_100_2000	In that case, let’s get back to our investigation.
A3_1800_PIKACHU_100_3000	According to Slowpoke, Gordon noticed something\nwhen he looked at these murals.
A3_1800_TIM_100_2000	Then these murals must hold the key to finding the\nprofessor’s whereabouts!
A3_1800_PIKACHU_100_4000	We’d better take a close look at them.
A3_1810_TIM_100_1000	Is Slowpoke OK?
A3_1810_RACHEL_100_1000	I think he’s hungry, but otherwise he seems fine.
A3_1810_RACHEL_100_2000	I gave him some of my lunch, and he perked right up!
A3_1810_RACHEL_100_3000	I’ll take care of Slowpoke—you just focus on finding\nthe professor!
A3_1820_YADON_100_1000	Slooow.
A3_1820_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’re pretty desperate to go find Gordon,\naren’t you?
A3_1820_PIKACHU_100_2000	I get that you’re worried, but you’ve really gotta take\nit easy for a bit.
A3_1820_PIKACHU_100_3000	You’ve had a rough couple days yourself.
A3_1820_YADON_100_2000	Slow slow.
A3_1830_TIM_100_1000	So these are the murals the professor was looking at.
A3_1830_PIKACHU_100_1000	They both depict Passimian.
A3_1830_TIM_100_2000	Yeah. But how do we know which of these two\nmurals he was actually looking at?
A3_1830_PIKACHU_100_2000	Maybe he looked at both of them. Either way, we’ll\nhave to give them each a thorough inspection.
A3_1880_TIM_100_1000	Professor Gordon noticed something when he was\nlooking at these murals...
A3_1880_PIKACHU_100_1000	We should check ’em out as well.\nMake sure not to miss any details!
A3_1890_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, where should we look first?
A3_1900_PIKACHU_5000_1000	Don’t you think we oughta look around here a\nlittle more?
A3_19001_TIM_100_1000	These are the medals we received.
A3_19001_PIKACHU_100_1000	They’re proof of all the good we’ve done with our\ngreat detective work. Let’s keep it up, Tim!
A3_19002_TIM_100_1000	This is an actual apple, right? Not an Applin?
A3_19002_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s just a normal apple, but it sure is hard to tell\nthem apart.
A3_1910_TIM_100_1000	Look at this Passimian’s face.\nIt seems...happy.
A3_1910_PIKACHU_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>Looks like my face when I’ve just eaten\nsomething sweet!</color>
A3_1920_TIM_100_1000	Look at this Passimian’s pose—it’s holding a Berry.
A3_1920_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’re right. It’s got a <color=#F39800FF>yellow Berry</color>.
A3_1920_PIKACHU_300_1000	The other wall had a blue Berry, but this\none’s yellow...
A3_19210_PIKACHU_100_1000	Here’s Gordon’s bag.
A3_19210_PIKACHU_100_2000	That’s a proper adventurer’s bag. It looks really cool!
A3_19210_GORDON_100_1000	Sorry, Pikachu. There’s no food in there.
A3_19210_PIKACHU_100_3000	Argh! I wasn’t asking for food!
A3_19215_TIM_100_1000	It’s Professor Gordon’s bag.
A3_19215_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s a proper adventurer’s bag. It looks really cool!
A3_1940_TIM_100_1000	I don’t think there’s anything else to see in this mural.
A3_1940_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, I think we’re finished here. Let’s go investigate\nsomewhere else.
A3_1955_PIKACHU_300_1000	We’ve gotta do something about this ice.
A3_1955_TIM_400_1000	This wall is way more frozen than the others.
A3_1955_PIKACHU_400_1000	If you look closely,<color=#F39800FF> it seems like there’s another\nmural on the middle wall too</color>.
A3_1955_TIM_400_2000	But with all this ice in the way, we can’t see what the\nmural is depicting.
A3_1955_PIKACHU_400_2000	If we want to see this mural, we’re gonna have to do\nsomething about all this ice first.
A3_1955_TIM_400_3000	I wonder what was drawn here.
A3_1960_TIM_100_1000	Professor Gordon noticed something when he was\nlooking at these murals...
A3_1960_PIKACHU_100_1000	We should check ’em out as well.\nMake sure not to miss any details!
A3_1970_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, where should we look first?
A3_1980_PIKACHU_5000_1000	Don’t you think we oughta look around here a\nlittle more?
A3_1990_TIM_100_1000	Ooh, this Passimian has a pretty strained expression.
A3_1990_PIKACHU_100_1000	Haha, yeah! Like <color=#F39800FF>it just ate something sour</color>!
A3_1990_TIM_100_2000	Yep, no other way to interpret that face.
A3_2000_TIM_100_1000	Look at this Passimian’s pose—it’s holding a Berry.
A3_2000_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’re right. It’s got a <color=#F39800FF>blue Berry</color>.
A3_2000_PIKACHU_300_1000	The other wall had a yellow Berry, but this\none’s blue...
A3_20110_TIM_100_1000	I’m so glad Darmanitan’s willing to help.
A3_20110_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah! With his strength, we should be able to bust up\nthat rubble!
A3_20110_PIKACHU_100_2000	Now we can save Gordon!
A3_20120_RACHEL_100_1000	Darmanitan! And...Pikachu’s riding it?!
A3_20120_RACHEL_100_2000	What in the world is going on?
A3_20120_PIKACHU_100_1000	Tim’ll explain everything later.
A3_20130_YADON_100_1000	(You’re gonna rescuuue Mr. Go, aren’tchaaa?)
A3_20130_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Is that human a friend of yours?)
A3_20130_YADON_100_2000	(Yeeeees. Please heeelp hiiiiim!)
A3_20130_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(U-uh, sure! Just leave it to me.)
A3_20130_PIKACHU_100_1000	I guess you’re feeling a bit guilty after hearing he’s a\nfriend, huh, Darmanitan?
A3_20140_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, wait! Where are you going? We gotta save\nGordon first!
A3_20150_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(This is the stuff you want me to break, right?)
A3_20150_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. Can you do it?
A3_20150_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(Oh, yeah. This’ll be easy!)
A3_20150_PIKACHU_100_2000	Then go for it, Darmanitan! Smash that rubble!
A3_20160_PIKACHU_100_1000	All right! Now we can rescue Gordon!
A3_20160_PIKACHU_100_2000	Thanks, Darmanitan!
A3_20160_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(I’d say “you’re welcome,” but that’d be kind of\nweird, wouldn’t it?)
A3_20160_YADON_100_1000	(Huuuh? When did the rubble go awaaaaay?)
A3_20160_PIKACHU_100_3000	You just now noticed that?!\nWell, anyway, now we can rescue Gordon.
A3_20160_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(Please don’t forget what I asked you, Pikachu.)
A3_20160_PIKACHU_100_4000	Of course not! Just wait a little bit!
A3_2020_TIM_100_1000	I don’t think there’s anything else to see in this mural.
A3_2020_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, I think we’re finished here. Let’s go investigate\nsomewhere else.
A3_20205_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK! Do you have any idea where your friends\nmight be?
A3_20205_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(They all said they were going upstairs. I think they’re\nstill there.)
A3_20205_PIKACHU_100_2000	And what kind of Pokémon are these friends of yours?
A3_20205_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(Vanillite, Mr. Mime, Bergmite, and Smoochum.)
A3_20205_PIKACHU_100_3000	Vanillite, Mr. Mime, Bergmite, and Smoochum?
A3_20205_PIKACHU_100_4000	We didn’t see any Pokémon like that on our way here.
A3_20205_PIKACHU_100_5000	Do you think they could have gone outside?
A3_20205_GHIHIDARUMA_100_3000	(I don’t think so.)
A3_20205_GHIHIDARUMA_100_4000	(They’d probably be scared of going outside because\nthey could run into humans out there.)
A3_20205_PIKACHU_100_6000	So they must be hiding somewhere.
A3_20205_PIKACHU_100_7000	OK. Let’s look for them upstairs.
A3_20205_GHIHIDARUMA_100_5000	(Yeah! Thanks, Pikachu!)
A3_20210_TIM_100_1000	I’ll be keeping an eye on the professor to make sure\nhe doesn’t do anything reckless.
A3_20210_TIM_100_2000	Please come back as quickly as you can.
A3_20210_PIKACHU_100_1000	Sure, just finding a few Pokémon should be a quick\nand easy errand for a great detective like me!
A3_20210_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’ll be finished in no time.
A3_20220_TIM_100_1000	Did you find the Pokémon?
A3_20230_RACHEL_100_1000	I’d heard that Darmanitan keep food in the snowball\non their heads...
A3_20230_RACHEL_100_2000	but I never thought I’d see a Pikachu in there!
A3_20230_RACHEL_100_3000	*giggle* You look pretty cute!
A3_20230_PIKACHU_100_1000	She says we’re cute, Darmanitan.
A3_20230_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Cute? Gosh, I think I’m blushing.)
A3_20240_RACHEL_100_1000	I can’t believe I got to see Darmanitan and Pikachu\nlooking so cute!
A3_20240_RACHEL_100_2000	Good thing I came along with Tim!
A3_20250_GORDON_100_1000	You certainly put me in a bit of a pickle, but I can’t\ndeny that you also helped me out of it.
A3_20250_GORDON_100_2000	So, I’d like to thank you, Darmanitan.
A3_20250_PIKACHU_100_500	Hey, Darmanitan! Gordon’s thanking you.
A3_20250_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Huh, really? Even though I did something bad\nbefore?)
A3_20250_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s hard to know what to say when someone thanks\nyou like that, isn’t it?
A3_20250_PIKACHU_100_2000	Not that he’d understand you anyway.
A3_20260_GORDON_100_1000	Thank you, Darmanitan.
A3_20270_YADON_100_1000	(Thaaank youuuuu for rescuing Mr. Go!)
A3_20270_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Yeah, about that...)
A3_20270_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(It was actually me who shut him in there. I didn’t\nrealize he was a friend.)
A3_20270_YADON_100_2000	(Ohhh, reeeally?)
A3_20270_YADON_100_3000	(It’s okaaay. Mr. Go is veeery forgiving. No need to\nfeeeeel bad abooout it!)
A3_20270_GHIHIDARUMA_100_3000	(Really? Thank you both!)
A3_20270_PIKACHU_100_1000	See, it all worked out, Darmanitan!
A3_20280_YADON_100_1000	(Thaaank youuuuu for rescuing Mr. Go!)
A3_20290_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(This wall looks different from the others.)
A3_20290_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, that’s a mural drawn by some humans. It’s got a\nmessage in it too.
A3_20300_HASSBOH01_100_1000	(Pikachu, can we go back to our pond now?)
A3_20300_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, yeah! Sorry! Thanks for all your help.
A3_20300_HASSBOH01_100_2000	(You’re welcome.)
A3_20300_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh, wait... How do we get across now?
A3_20300_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(It’s OK. Leave it to me!)
A3_20300_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(It’s water, so if I do this...)
A3_20305_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(There, now we can cross.)
A3_20305_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, right. Freezing water’s not a problem for an\nice Pokémon.
A3_20320_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(This wall looks different from the others.)
A3_20320_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, that’s a mural drawn by some humans. It’s got a\nmessage in it too.
A3_20325_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(I think everyone’s somewhere on this floor.)
A3_20325_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(They might be hiding in places that are hard to find.)
A3_20325_PIKACHU_100_1000	Got it. Let’s search carefully.
A3_20325_GHIHIDARUMA_100_3000	(Thanks, Pikachu!)
A3_20325_PIKACHU_100_2000	No problem. It’s my turn to help you out now!
A3_20330_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Oh, here she is.)
A3_20330_PIKACHU_100_1000	Huh? I don’t see anyone.
A3_20330_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(I think she’s just sleeping.)
A3_20330_GHIHIDARUMA_100_3000	(Hey, Vanillite! Wake up!)
A3_20330_VANIPETI_100_1000	(Hmm...? Is that you, Darmanitan?)
A3_20350_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wow! There was a Vanillite inside all of that snow!
A3_20350_PIKACHU_100_2000	Now that I think about it, I guess I had heard that\nVanillite usually sleep in snow.
A3_20350_VANIPETI_100_1000	(Oh, you have a Pikachu with you!)
A3_20350_VANIPETI_100_2000	(Anyway, did you need something, Darmanitan?)
A3_20350_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(I hadn’t seen you in a while, so we came to see how\nyou were doing.)
A3_20350_PIKACHU_100_3000	Now that we’ve found you, do you mind answering a\ncouple of questions?
A3_20360_VANIPETI_100_1000	(You want to ask me something?)
A3_20360_SEL_0_1000	About you, Vanillite...
A3_20360_SEL_0_2000	About the other Pokémon...
A3_20360_PIKACHU_300_1000	What were you doing here?
A3_20360_VANIPETI_300_1000	(I was having fun making it snow! It’s been a long time\nsince I’ve had such a wide-open space to play in.)
A3_20360_PIKACHU_300_2000	So that’s why there’s so much snow in here.
A3_20360_VANIPETI_300_2000	(Then I got tired from all that playing and went\nto sleep.)
A3_20360_GHIHIDARUMA_300_1000	(You weren’t in danger or anything?)
A3_20360_VANIPETI_300_3000	(No, nothing like that. You’re such a worrywart,\nDarmanitan!)
A3_20360_PIKACHU_400_1000	So the other Pokémon aren’t with you?
A3_20360_VANIPETI_400_1000	(No, I was the only one playing in this room.)
A3_20360_PIKACHU_400_2000	I see. I guess the other Pokémon are in other\nrooms, then.
A3_20375_SECRETMUCHUL_100_1000	(*sniffle* Waahhh...)
A3_20375_PIKACHU_100_1000	Huh? Did you hear someone crying just now?
A3_20375_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Yeah, I did! It’s coming from inside the ice!)
A3_20375_PIKACHU_100_2000	There might be someone inside! Can you break this\nice, Darmanitan?
A3_20375_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(Yep! No problem!)
A3_20390_MUCHUL_100_1000	(Oooh, Darmanitan! Thanks for rescuing me!)
A3_20390_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(We’ve been looking for you, Smoochum! I’m so glad\nwe found you!)
A3_20390_PIKACHU_100_1000	I sure didn’t expect to find you inside the ice...
A3_20390_MUCHUL_100_2000	(Huh? Who’s that growing out of your head,\nDarmanitan?)
A3_20390_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(This is Pikachu. He’s helping me look for everyone.)
A3_20390_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, nice to meet ya! I know this is pretty sudden,\nbut do you mind if I ask you some questions?
A3_2040_TIM_100_1000	If we want to get farther into the ruins, we have to\ngather the Berries depicted in the murals.
A3_2040_PIKACHU_100_1000	Right. We need a sour Berry that’s blue, and a\nsweet Berry that’s yellow.
A3_2040_TIM_100_2000	The colors we can see, so that part’s easy—but what\nabout the flavors?
A3_2040_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hmm, even I don’t know what every Berry tastes like.
A3_2040_PIKACHU_100_3000	Guess I’ll just have to try ’em all!
A3_2040_TIM_100_3000	What?! You’re going to eat them?!
A3_2040_PIKACHU_100_4000	That’s the fastest way to get the info we need, right?
A3_2040_TIM_100_4000	I guess... Just don’t make yourself sick, OK?
A3_2040_PIKACHU_100_5000	Don’t worry. We Pokémon LOVE Berries!
A3_2040_PIKACHU_100_6000	All right, Tim! Now that we’ve got a plan, let’s go get\nthose Berries!
A3_20400_MUCHUL_100_1000	(What do you wanna ask me?)
A3_20400_SEL_0_1000	About you, Smoochum...
A3_20400_SEL_0_2000	About the other Pokémon...
A3_20400_PIKACHU_300_1000	How did you get inside that ice?
A3_20400_MUCHUL_300_1000	(I wanted to make myself a house out of shiny,\nsparkly ice!)
A3_20400_MUCHUL_300_2000	(So I kept making the ice bigger and bigger, but then\nI couldn’t get out...)
A3_20400_MUCHUL_300_3000	(*sniffle* I was so lonely...)
A3_20400_PIKACHU_300_2000	There, there. You’re safe now, so no need to cry.
A3_20400_PIKACHU_400_1000	Is there anyone else here with you?
A3_20400_MUCHUL_400_1000	(No, nobody. That’s why I couldn’t get out.)
A3_20410_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(There’s a weird drawing here.)
A3_20410_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yep, there sure is.
A3_20420_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(There’s a weird drawing here.)
A3_20420_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yep, there sure is.
A3_20430_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(There’s a weird drawing here.)
A3_20430_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yep, there sure is.
A3_20435_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s some really thick ice.
A3_20435_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(I’m pretty sure I can break it with a punch.)
A3_20435_PIKACHU_100_2000	Really? Then please do, Darmanitan!
A3_20460_GBARRIERD_100_1000	(Oh, Darmanitan! Our hero!)
A3_20460_GBARRIERD_100_2000	(We’ve been stuck here for ages! Thank you so much\nfor saving us!)
A3_20460_GBARRIERD_100_3000	(Allow me to express my gratitude with a tap dance!)
A3_20460_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, that’s right. Ice-type Mr. Mime are supposed to\nbe good at tap dancing.
A3_20460_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(You don’t need to dance... I’m just glad you’re safe.)
A3_20460_PIKACHU_100_2000	So the shadow we saw beyond the ice was actually\nMr. Mime.
A3_20460_GBARRIERD_100_4000	(Hmm? I don’t believe this Pikachu and I have\nbeen introduced!)
A3_20460_PIKACHU_100_3000	That’s because Darmanitan and I have only just\nbecome friends—but that’s a story for another time.\nCould I ask you some questions?
A3_20470_GBARRIERD_100_1000	(What do you want to know?)
A3_20470_SEL_0_1000	About you, Mr. Mime...
A3_20470_SEL_0_2000	About the other Pokémon...
A3_20470_PIKACHU_300_1000	What were you doing here?
A3_20470_GBARRIERD_300_1000	(That Bergmite over there was trying to cool this\nroom down.)
A3_20470_GBARRIERD_300_2000	(So I offered to help make a big wall of ice together.\nWe really made an effort!)
A3_20470_GBARRIERD_300_3000	(But apparently there is such a thing as too much\neffort. It never occurred to me that we wouldn’t be\nable to get out!)
A3_20470_PIKACHU_300_2000	So you two made this ice, eh?
A3_20470_PIKACHU_300_3000	What a pair of troublemakers!
A3_20470_PIKACHU_400_1000	Are you two the only ones in this room?
A3_20470_GBARRIERD_400_1000	(Yes, it’s just me and Bergmite here.)
A3_20490_KACHIKOHRU_100_1000	(Oh, if it isn’t Darmanitan! And...who might you be?)
A3_20490_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m the great Detective Pikachu, Darmanitan’s\nnew friend.
A3_20490_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Everyone was taking so long to come back that I got\nworried, so I came looking for you.)
A3_20490_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(Pikachu’s been helping me search.)
A3_20490_KACHIKOHRU_100_2000	(Ah, sorry to have put you through all that trouble.\nYou see, we weren’t able to leave this room.)
A3_20490_PIKACHU_100_2000	What in the world happened? Can you tell me?
A3_2050_RACHEL_100_1000	You’re looking for Berries?
A3_2050_RACHEL_100_2000	Whenever the professor and his assistants are at\na research site, they always carefully survey the\nsurrounding area.
A3_2050_RACHEL_100_3000	Chris should be able to help you if there are any\nBerries you can’t find.
A3_20500_KACHIKOHRU_100_1000	(What would you like to know?)
A3_20500_SEL_0_1000	About you, Bergmite...
A3_20500_SEL_0_2000	About the other Pokémon...
A3_20500_PIKACHU_300_1000	Why were you walled in here?
A3_20500_KACHIKOHRU_300_1000	(I was trying to make this place more comfortable to\nlive in.)
A3_20500_KACHIKOHRU_300_2000	(So Mr. Mime and I worked together to make a wall\nof ice.)
A3_20500_KACHIKOHRU_300_3000	(Mr. Mime was practically putting on a show! I tried to\nmatch that energy, but we both got carried away and\nended up making too much ice...)
A3_20500_PIKACHU_300_2000	And that’s how you got stuck.
A3_20500_GHIHIDARUMA_300_1000	(I’m glad you’re both OK!)
A3_20500_PIKACHU_400_1000	Are you two the only ones in this room?
A3_20500_KACHIKOHRU_400_1000	(Yeah, just me and Mr. Mime.)
A3_20510_PIKACHU_100_1000	Have we found all of your friends?
A3_20510_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Yeah, all the ones I wanted help looking for.)
A3_20510_PIKACHU_100_2000	All the ones you—huh?
A3_20510_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(Now that we know everyone’s safe, why don’t we\nhead back?)
A3_20510_PIKACHU_100_3000	Oh, uh, sure!
A3_20520_JOSHUA_100_1000	Wh-whoa! What’s a Darmanitan doing here?!
A3_20520_PIKACHU_100_1000	This isn’t a bad guy, OK? Don’t attack him\nor anything!
A3_20520_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Yeah, I know. I won’t just go around attacking\npeople anymore.)
A3_20530_JOSHUA_100_1000	What’s an Ice-type Darmanitan doing here in\nthis climate?
A3_20530_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s no wonder he’s surprised, not knowing the\nsituation and all.
A3_20540_GONBE_100_1000	(Oh, Pikachu!)
A3_20540_GONBE_100_2000	(You’ve grown much bigger in the short time since I\nlast saw you.)
A3_20540_PIKACHU_100_1000	Take another look, Munchlax. I’m just riding on top\nof Darmanitan.
A3_20540_GONBE_100_3000	(And you’re so round and white...)
A3_20540_GONBE_100_4000	(Like a big delicious scoop of ice cream! Mind if I\nhave a little taste?)
A3_20540_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(What?! Hey, I’m not food!)
A3_20540_PIKACHU_100_2000	This fella really doesn’t think about anything other\nthan food, does he?
A3_20550_GONBE_100_1000	(Seeing something so round and white sure makes\nme hungry.)
A3_20550_PIKACHU_100_1000	This fella really doesn’t think about anything other\nthan food, does he?
A3_20560_NAGETUKESARU_100_1000	(Who are you? I haven’t seen your face around these\nparts before.)
A3_20560_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(I just started living here recently.)
A3_20560_NAGETUKESARU_100_2000	(Well, there’s plenty of food to go around, so you can\nlive here as long as you like.)
A3_20560_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s kind of you to say, but I doubt Darmanitan can\nlive in a climate like this.
A3_20560_PIKACHU_100_2000	We need to think of a solution.
A3_20570_NAGETUKESARU_100_1000	(Try not to cause too much trouble.)
A3_20580_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thanks for your help earlier, Lotad.

A3_20580_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Oooh, that sounds fun!)
A3_20580_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hey, we don’t have time to play right now!
A3_20580_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(Oh, I guess you’re right...)
A3_20590_HASSBOH01_100_1000	(Come back to play any time! ♪)
A3_2060_TIM_100_1000	We need to ask Monferno if it’ll help us melt the ice\ncovering the mural.
A3_2060_PIKACHU_100_1000	Right! Let’s go ask Monferno!
A3_20600_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(There are some tasty-looking Berries on this tree.)
A3_20600_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(I think I’ll bring some to the others later.)
A3_20610_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(There are some tasty-looking Berries on this tree.)

A3_20640_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(I think I’ll bring some to the others later.)
A3_20650_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(This is the only tree with no Berries.)
A3_20650_PIKACHU_100_1000	Apparently there aren’t any more Tamato Berries\nleft around here.
A3_20660_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(There are some tasty-looking Berries on this tree.)
A3_20660_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(I think I’ll bring some to the others later.)
A3_20670_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, where are you going?
A3_20670_PIKACHU_100_2000	We don’t need to go that way right now.
A3_20715_PIKACHU_100_1000	We need to let Tim and the others know that the\ndoor closed.
A3_20720_PIKACHU_100_1000	Why did the door suddenly close like that?
A3_20720_PIKACHU_100_2000	Do you think you’re strong enough to open\nthat door?
A3_20720_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Nuh-uh. Even I couldn’t open a door that big.)
A3_20720_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yeah, I figured. I’d better go discuss this with Tim.
A3_20720_PIKACHU_100_4000	Let’s go back to the others, Darmanitan!
A3_20730_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’ve got bad news, Tim—the door to the ground floor\njust closed!
A3_20730_TIM_100_1000	What?! Is that what that big rumbling sound was?!
A3_20730_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, that was the door shutting tight.
A3_20730_TIM_100_2000	But why would it do that?
A3_20730_PIKACHU_100_3000	No idea. It just kinda happened.
A3_20730_TIM_100_3000	What do we do? We’ve gotta find a way out!
A3_20730_PIKACHU_100_4000	Maybe we should try talking to Gordon?
A3_20730_PIKACHU_100_5000	He might know something we don’t.
A3_20730_TIM_100_4000	Good idea. I’ll see what he has to say.
A3_20740_RACHEL_100_1000	What was that sound?
A3_20750_GORDON_100_1000	That rumble we just heard... I’ve got a bad feeling\nabout it.
A3_20760_YADON_100_1000	(Welcome baaack. Why do you look so wooorried?)
A3_2080_TIM_100_1000	Wow! There was so much ice, but it’s all melted\nclean away!
A3_2080_PIKACHU_100_1000	Now we can get a good look at that middle mural.
A3_2080_MOUKAZARU_100_1000	Fernooo!
A3_2080_PIKACHU_100_2000	After feeling the warmth of your flames for a moment,\nthe cold feels even worse?
A3_2080_PIKACHU_100_3000	I’m really sorry about that. We pushed you\npretty hard.
A3_2080_MOUKAZARU_100_2000	Mon!
A3_2080_PIKACHU_100_4000	You’re gonna move somewhere warm until this snow\nstops? Yeah, that makes sense.
A3_2080_TIM_100_2000	Thanks so much for helping us before you leave,\nMonferno.
A3_2080_PIKACHU_100_5000	I hope you come back here when it gets warm again!
A3_2080_MOUKAZARU_100_3000	Ferno!
A3_2080_TIM_100_3000	And off it goes.
A3_2080_PIKACHU_100_6000	It’s up to us now.
A3_2080_TIM_100_4000	Yeah. Now that Monferno’s melted the ice for us...
A3_2080_TIM_100_5000	let’s check out that middle mural.
A3_20810_TIM_100_1000	Do you want to stop riding Darmanitan?
A3_20810_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_20810_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_20810_PIKACHU_300_1000	Yeah, we’ve done everything we need to do.
A3_20810_PIKACHU_400_1000	No, not yet. Wait just a bit.
A3_20820_RACHEL_100_1000	Do you want to head back home or something?
A3_20820_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_20820_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_20820_PIKACHU_300_1000	We’ve done enough investigating. Let’s go talk to Tim\nand then head back.
A3_20820_PIKACHU_400_1000	No, I wanna look around the ruins a little more.
A3_20830_GORDON_100_1000	I need to figure out a way to help you all get home.
A3_20830_GORDON_100_2000	We can’t allow Pokémon to suffer because of what\nhumans did to them.
A3_20830_PIKACHU_100_500	He says he’s gonna help you get back to your home.
A3_20830_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(That’s great! This guy is really nice!)
A3_20830_PIKACHU_100_1000	He is. It just goes to show that every human\nis different.
A3_20840_YADON_100_1000	(Looooks like we’re gonna be wiiith each other for a\nwhiiile, still.)
A3_20840_YADON_100_2000	(Glaaad to have you wiiith us, Darmanitaaan.)
A3_20840_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(You too, Slowpoke.)
A3_20845_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, I see your head’s back to normal.
A3_20845_KORIPPOI_100_1000	(It’s really hot here, so I get very uncomfortable if I\ndon’t keep cooling my head!)
A3_20845_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(I’m glad it went back to normal.)
A3_20845_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(Thanks for your help before, Eiscue.)
A3_20845_KORIPPOI_100_2000	(No, I’m the one who should be thanking you! Thanks\nso much for everything, Darmanitan.)
A3_20845_KORIPPOI_100_3000	(I’m feeling much better now, thanks to you.)
A3_20845_GHIHIDARUMA_100_3000	(Let’s play together more when we get back home!)
A3_20850_JOSHUA_100_1000	We’re going to help Darmanitan and the others\nget home?
A3_20850_JOSHUA_100_2000	Guess things are about to get busy!
A3_20860_GONBE_100_1000	(If we’re gonna be spending more time together for a\nwhile, then let’s all eat curry together!)
A3_20860_GONBE_100_2000	(That’s the quickest way to make friends.)
A3_20860_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Is that curry stuff tasty?)
A3_20860_GONBE_100_3000	(Of course! And the curry Chris makes is the best in\nthe whole world!)
A3_20860_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(I can’t wait to try it!)
A3_20870_NAGETUKESARU_100_1000	(So you’re all going home?)
A3_20870_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. Sorry for all the fuss we caused.
A3_20870_NAGETUKESARU_100_2000	(Don’t worry about it.)
A3_20880_HASSBOH01_100_1000	(You’re leaving already?)
A3_20880_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s the plan.
A3_20880_HASSBOH02_100_1000	(Come again sometime!)
A3_20880_HASSBOH03_100_1000	(Next time, we can all sing together!♪)
A3_20880_PIKACHU_100_2000	For sure! We’ll come back some time just to play.
A3_20880_PIKACHU_100_3000	We’ve got a friend who loves music—we’ll bring her\nalong too!
A3_2090_TIM_100_1000	What sort of hint do you think we’ll get from the\nmiddle mural?
A3_2090_PIKACHU_100_1000	Remember to think about how it relates to the\nstatues, Tim.
A3_20930_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(You’re going home already, Pikachu?)
A3_20930_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_20930_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_20930_PIKACHU_300_1000	We’ve finished our investigation, so I guess it’s\ntime to head home.
A3_20930_PIKACHU_300_2000	Let’s go talk to Tim and the others.
A3_20930_PIKACHU_400_1000	There’s still something I gotta do, so I’d appreciate\nyou stickin’ with me a bit longer.
A3_20930_GHIHIDARUMA_400_1000	(Sure!)
A3_2100_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, where should we look first?
A3_21010_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(I heard we might all be able to get back home!)
A3_21010_VANIPETI_100_1000	(Yay! I’ll be able to get a good night’s sleep!)
A3_21010_PIKACHU_100_1000	You seemed to be sleeping pretty well when we first\nmet too.
A3_21020_MUCHUL_100_1000	(We can go home?! Yaaay!)
A3_21020_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s right—so can you stop crying?
A3_21030_GBARRIERD_100_1000	(Hooray! We can go home now!)
A3_21030_GBARRIERD_100_2000	(I must express my happiness through dance!)
A3_21030_PIKACHU_100_1000	You seem to really love tap dancing, Mr. Mime.
A3_21040_KACHIKOHRU_100_1000	(Oh, good. Now I can see all the others again.)
A3_21040_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, right. Bergmite usually live in herds.
A3_2110_PIKACHU_5000_1000	Don’t you think we oughta look around here a\nlittle more?
A3_2120_PIKACHU_100_1000	Listen up, Tim.
A3_2120_PIKACHU_100_2000	Art isn’t something you just look at. It’s something\nyou feel.
A3_2130_TIM_100_1000	This Passimian is breathing fire!
A3_2130_TIM_100_2000	Can Passimian even do that?
A3_2130_PIKACHU_100_1000	No, they can’t use those kinds of moves.
A3_2130_PIKACHU_100_2000	I think this means <color=#F39800FF>it ate something so spicy, it’s\nbreathing fire</color>.
A3_2130_TIM_100_3000	Yeah, that would explain it.
A3_2140_TIM_100_1000	This Passimian is holding <color=#F39800FF>a red Berry</color>.
A3_2140_PIKACHU_100_1000	A red Berry this time, eh? I wonder what kind of\nBerry it is.
A3_2160_TIM_100_1000	I don’t think there’s anything else to see in this mural.
A3_2160_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, I think we’re finished here. Let’s go investigate\nsomewhere else.
A3_2180_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, we were finally able to examine the\nmiddle mural.
A3_2180_PIKACHU_100_2000	Now we need to think about what sort of Berry we\nshould place on the middle statue.
A3_2210_TIM_100_1000	There are some red Berries growing here.
A3_2210_PIKACHU_100_1000	Those look like Haban Berries. Let’s give ’em a\ntaste test...
A3_2210_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hmm... This unique bitter taste... Yep, these are\ndefinitely Haban Berries.
A3_2210_TIM_100_2000	<color=#F39800FF>So Haban Berries are red and bitter? Got it.</color>
A3_2210_PIKACHU_100_3000	Personally, I’d rather grab a coffee if I’m craving\nsomething bitter.
A3_2210_PIKACHU_200_1000	We already got Haban Berries.
A3_2220_TIM_100_1000	There are some pink Berries growing here.
A3_2220_PIKACHU_100_1000	Think these are Nanab Berries. As for the taste...
A3_2220_PIKACHU_100_2000	Mmmm! Yep, no mistaking this sweet flavor!\nDefinitely Nanab Berries.
A3_2220_TIM_100_2000	<color=#F39800FF>Got it. Nanab Berries are pink and sweet.</color>
A3_2220_PIKACHU_100_3000	I kinda wanna eat another one...
A3_2220_PIKACHU_200_1000	We already got a Nanab Berry.
A3_2230_TIM_100_1000	There are some yellow Berries growing here.
A3_2230_PIKACHU_100_1000	Pretty sure those are Pinap Berries.\nHere, lemme taste one for ya.
A3_2230_PIKACHU_100_2000	The skin is sour, but the fruit inside has that iconic\nspicy flavor...
A3_2230_TIM_100_2000	<color=#F39800FF>Pinap Berries are yellow, sour, and spicy... Noted.</color>
A3_2230_PIKACHU_100_3000	You’d think they’d taste bad, but the two flavors have\na pretty delicate balance goin’ on.
A3_2230_TIM_200_1000	We already got a Pinap Berry.
A3_2240_TIM_100_1000	There are some blue Berries growing here.
A3_2240_PIKACHU_100_1000	I think those might be Yache Berries? Lemme give\n’em a taste.
A3_2240_PIKACHU_100_2000	Whoa! They’re SO sour!\n...But the aftertaste is really refreshing.
A3_2240_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yep, these are definitely Yache Berries.\nThere’s no mistaking that sourness!
A3_2240_TIM_100_2000	<color=#F39800FF>Blue Berries that are sour...</color>
A3_2240_PIKACHU_200_1000	We already got Yache Berries.
A3_2250_TIM_100_1000	There are some blue Berries growing here.
A3_2250_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s see what they taste like...
A3_2250_PIKACHU_100_2000	<color=#F39800FF>They’re hard! And bitter too! Ugh, these are definitely\nCoba Berries.</color>
A3_2250_PIKACHU_100_3000	Oof, I need a glass of water.
A3_2250_TIM_100_2000	Are you OK, Pikachu?
A3_2250_PIKACHU_200_1000	We already have Coba Berries.
A3_2260_TIM_100_1000	There aren’t any Berries growing on this tree.
A3_2260_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hmmm... What sort of tree is it, then?
A3_2260_PIKACHU_100_2000	Why don’t you try asking Chris?\nHe might know something.
A3_2270_TIM_100_1000	There aren’t any Berries growing on this tree.
A3_2270_PIKACHU_100_1000	Chris might know something about it.
A3_2280_TIM_100_1000	According to Chris, it’s a Tamato Berry tree.
A3_2280_PIKACHU_100_1000	But there aren’t any Tamato Berries growing on it now.
A3_2290_TIM_100_1000	There are some yellow Berries growing here.
A3_2290_PIKACHU_100_1000	Those look like Shuca Berries, right?\nHere, let me taste one to make sure.
A3_2290_PIKACHU_100_2000	Mmhmm. I’d know this sweet,\ndelicious flavor anywhere!
A3_2290_PIKACHU_100_3000	These are one-hundred-percent Shuca Berries.
A3_2290_TIM_100_2000	<color=#F39800FF>Sweet, yellow Berries, eh?</color>
A3_2290_TIM_200_1000	We already have a Shuca Berry.
A3_2300_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’ve sure gathered a lot of Berries, Tim.
A3_2300_TIM_100_1000	I wonder if there are any other Berry trees\naround here.
A3_2300_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’m not sure. Why don’t you ask Chris?
A3_2300_PIKACHU_100_3000	He’s been here this whole time, so I bet he knows\nmore about this place than we do.
A3_2300_TIM_100_2000	You’re right. Chris probably knows this area\npretty well.
A3_2310_PIKACHU_100_1000	First, let’s go see Chris.
A3_2310_TIM_100_1000	Right. He should still be cooking.
A3_2310_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah. And maybe he’s got an ingredient that we can\nuse as a substitute.
A3_2330_TIM_100_1000	...So anyway, would you mind sharing a little of that\ncurry with us?
A3_2330_JOSHUA_100_1000	My curry will help you solve a puzzle in the ruins?\nThat’s incredible!
A3_2330_JOSHUA_100_2000	Take as much as you like! I hope it helps you find\nthe professor.
A3_2340_PIKACHU_100_1000	So for this statue we need...
A3_2340_TIM_100_1000	A sweet, yellow Shuca Berry!
A3_2340_PIKACHU_100_2000	This has got to be right.
A3_2350_PIKACHU_100_1000	So for this statue we need...
A3_2350_TIM_100_1000	Some spicy, red Tamato curry!
A3_2350_PIKACHU_100_2000	This has got to be right.
A3_2360_PIKACHU_100_1000	So for this statue we need...
A3_2360_TIM_100_1000	A sour, blue Yache Berry!
A3_2360_PIKACHU_100_2000	This has got to be right.
A3_2365_PIKACHU_100_1000	All right! You know what to put on which statue,\ndon’t you, Tim?
A3_2365_TIM_100_1000	I think so. Let’s give it a try right now!
A3_2370_PIKACHU_100_1000	All right! You know what to put on which statue,\ndon’t you, Tim?
A3_2370_PIKACHU_100_2000	Why don’t we do that right now?
A3_2370_SEL_0_1000	Sure
A3_2370_SEL_0_2000	Not yet
A3_2370_TIM_300_1000	OK, let’s go!
A3_2370_PIKACHU_300_1000	I hope this activates the mechanism.
A3_2370_TIM_400_1000	Wait a minute. We might still be missing something.
A3_2370_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Let’s go to the statues when you’re ready.
A3_2380_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, we’ve placed Berries or curry on all the statues...\nWhat now?
A3_2400_TIM_100_1000	All right! Now we can keep going!
A3_2400_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. Let’s hurry and find Gordon.
A3_2410_RACHEL_100_1000	So the curry Chris made was the key to solving\nthe puzzle?
A3_2410_RACHEL_100_2000	Sounds like all his work making it paid off!
A3_2410_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, we’ll have to thank him later.
A3_2410_PIKACHU_100_1000	Of course, if he hadn’t made the curry, we would’ve\nbeen fine with just the Tamato Berry...
A3_2410_PIKACHU_100_2000	Ah well... I guess there’s no point in saying that now.
A3_2430_RACHEL_100_1000	I’m going to keep looking after Slowpoke, so you can\ngo on ahead.
A3_2430_TIM_100_1000	Thanks, Rachel.
A3_2430_RACHEL_100_2000	You’d better find the professor soon, for Slowpoke’s\nsake as well!
A3_2430_TIM_100_2000	Yeah, you’re right. I hope he’s not far beyond here...
A3_2440_YADON_100_1000	Slowww...
A3_2440_PIKACHU_100_1000	You were frozen in place until just a little bit ago!\nDon’t hurt yourself by moving too much!
A3_2440_YADON_100_2000	Slow!
A3_2440_PIKACHU_100_2000	I see. Well, you’re a loyal one, that’s for sure.
A3_25010_METENOSHELL01_200_1000	(Hurry and smash my shell!)
A3_25010_METENOSHELL01_300_1000	(Hey, can you guys help me get back home?)
A3_25010_GHIHIDARUMA_300_1000	(You’re not from these ruins?)
A3_25010_METENOSHELL01_300_2000	(Nah, my home is up above the sky.)
A3_25010_METENOSHELL01_300_3000	(But my shell got so heavy that I fell here.)
A3_25010_PIKACHU_300_1000	So that heavy shell of yours is why you can’t get\nback up to the sky, eh?
A3_25010_PIKACHU_300_2000	If you’re open to a slightly violent solution to your\ncurrent problem, I bet Darmanitan could break that\nshell of yours with one punch!
A3_25010_GHIHIDARUMA_300_2000	(Yeah! I bet I could!)
A3_25010_METENOSHELL01_300_4000	(Thanks! Could ya go ahead and do it right now?)
A3_25030_METENOREDCORE_200_1000	(You punched my shell right off! I feel like I’ve\nbeen reborn!)
A3_25030_METENOREDCORE_200_2000	(Now I can definitely get back up to the sky.\nThanks, you two!)
A3_25030_PIKACHU_200_1000	Wow, it sure took off in a hurry. But that is what\nit wanted.
A3_25040_METENOSHELL02_200_1000	(Man, I’m so hungry...)
A3_25040_METENOSHELL02_300_1000	(I’m really hungry... Could you guys help me get back\nto the sky?)
A3_25040_PIKACHU_300_1000	Huh? What do you mean? Can’t you get back\nthere yourself?
A3_25040_METENOSHELL02_300_2000	(I can’t. My shell’s too heavy.)
A3_25040_METENOSHELL02_300_3000	(I was fleeing from a big scary Pokémon and fell\ndown here.)
A3_25040_METENOSHELL02_300_4000	(Thanks to that, I escaped, but now I can’t get\nback home.)
A3_25040_METENOSHELL02_300_5000	(There’s almost nothing I can eat down here... I’m sure\nI could fly again if I could just get rid of my shell.)
A3_25040_GHIHIDARUMA_300_1000	(I could break that tiny shell with one punch.)
A3_25040_PIKACHU_300_2000	Yeah. But just be extra careful not to hurt the\ncore inside!
A3_25040_METENOSHELL02_300_6000	(Thanks! Then I’ll be able to get back home!)
A3_25060_METENOYELLOWCORE_200_1000	(Thanks! You punched my shell to smithereens!)
A3_25060_METENOYELLOWCORE_200_2000	(Now I can get back to my home above the sky!)
A3_25060_PIKACHU_200_1000	Wow, it disappeared in an instant. Be careful out\nthere next time, Minior...
A3_25070_METENOSHELL03_200_1000	(I wanna go home! Please help me!)
A3_25070_METENOSHELL03_300_1000	(Hey, you! Could you help me get back up to\nthe sky?)
A3_25070_PIKACHU_300_1000	Are you lost, Minior?
A3_25070_METENOSHELL03_300_2000	(Well, I was floating up above the sky when my body\nstarted feeling heavy—and then I fell down here!)
A3_25070_METENOSHELL03_300_3000	(Now I’m separated from my family! I’m so lonely!\nPlease, won’t you help me?)
A3_25070_PIKACHU_300_2000	Your body will get lighter if your shell breaks, right?
A3_25070_GHIHIDARUMA_300_1000	(I can break it with a punch!)
A3_25070_METENOSHELL03_300_4000	(Right now I can handle just about anything, so go\nahead and gimme your best punch!)
A3_25090_METENOBLUECORE_200_1000	(Yaaay! I feel so much lighter now!)
A3_25090_METENOBLUECORE_200_2000	(Now I can go rejoin my family! Thank you so much!)
A3_25090_PIKACHU_200_1000	Aaand it’s gone. I hope it makes it home safely.
A3_2510_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oof... It’s even colder down here...
A3_2510_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hey, Tim. Can I borrow your jacket?
A3_2510_TIM_100_1000	You’re covered in fur, Pikachu. Shouldn’t you be\nbetter suited to the cold than me?
A3_2510_PIKACHU_100_3000	Fur or no fur, this place is COLD! If we keep standing\naround like this, we’ll freeze solid!
A3_2510_PIKACHU_100_4000	At this point, we better hurry and find Professor\nGordon for our own sake!
A3_2510_TIM_100_2000	Yeah...
A3_25110_RINGUMA01_200_1000	(My friend’s really hungry after being frozen for\nso long.)
A3_25110_RINGUMA01_200_2000	(We’re gonna go look for food together now.)
A3_25110_PIKACHU_200_2000	Sounds good. Be careful, you two!
A3_25110_RINGUMA01_300_1000	(Hey, Pikachu. My friend got back safe.)
A3_25110_PIKACHU_300_1000	Glad to hear it, Ursaring!
A3_25110_RINGUMA01_300_2000	(I’m about to explain that we’ve gotta be more\ncareful from now on. Thanks for your help, Pikachu.)
A3_25110_PIKACHU_700_1000	You just sit tight, Ursaring! We’ll bring your friend\nback in no time!
A3_25110_RINGUMA01_700_1000	(Sorry for the trouble. I appreciate it.)
A3_25110_RINGUMA01_800_1000	(My friend was headed toward the ruins...)
A3_25110_PIKACHU_800_2000	If we find your friend in there, we’ll be sure to tell you\nright away.
A3_25110_RINGUMA01_900_1000	(*sigh* Where could he be?)
A3_25110_GHIHIDARUMA_900_1000	(Huh? It’s the Pokémon we saw earlier.)
A3_25110_PIKACHU_900_1000	Another Ursaring? It looks kinda down in the dumps.
A3_25110_RINGUMA01_900_2000	(My friend and I came here from a faraway bamboo\nforest to forage for food...)
A3_25110_RINGUMA01_900_3000	(But then we got separated.)
A3_25110_PIKACHU_900_2000	I get why you’re worried. Do you know where\nthey went?
A3_25110_RINGUMA01_900_4000	(He said he was going to the ruins, but I haven’t\nheard anything since.)
A3_25110_PIKACHU_900_3000	Yeah, it might be talking about the Ursaring we\njust saw.
A3_25110_PIKACHU_900_4000	Let’s go ask!
A3_25110_PIKACHU_900_5000	You just sit tight, Ursaring! I’m pretty sure you’ll see\nyour friend again soon.
A3_25110_RINGUMA01_900_5000	(Thanks a bunch, Pikachu.)
A3_25110_RINGUMA01_1000_1000	(*sigh* Where could he be?)
A3_25110_PIKACHU_1000_1000	What’s wrong, Ursaring? You look really down in\nthe dumps.
A3_25110_RINGUMA01_1000_2000	(My friend and I came here from a faraway bamboo\nforest to forage for food...)
A3_25110_RINGUMA01_1000_3000	(But then we got separated.)
A3_25110_PIKACHU_1000_2000	I get why you’re worried. Do you know where\nthey went?
A3_25110_RINGUMA01_1000_4000	(He said he was going to the ruins, but I haven’t\nheard anything since.)
A3_25110_PIKACHU_1000_3000	The ruins, huh? You know anything about that,\nDarmanitan?
A3_25110_GHIHIDARUMA_1000_1000	(No, I haven’t seen anything.)
A3_25110_PIKACHU_1000_4000	I see...
A3_25110_PIKACHU_1000_5000	Well, we’ll keep an eye out—and if we find anything\nwe’ll let you know!
A3_25110_RINGUMA01_1000_5000	(Thanks a bunch, Pikachu.)
A3_25140_RINGUMA02_200_1000	(Huh? Where am I...and what was I doing?)
A3_25140_PIKACHU_200_1000	Oh, good. Looks like it’s OK.
A3_25140_PIKACHU_200_2000	Seems a bit groggy though...
A3_25140_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	(What should we do?)
A3_25140_PIKACHU_200_3000	Let’s see what it has to say first.\nWe’ll get a better idea of how it’s doing.
A3_25150_RINGUMA02_100_1000	(I feel bad for makin’ my friend worry so much.)
A3_25150_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s OK, Ursaring. I’m sure your friend’s not upset\nat you.
A3_25150_RINGUMA02_100_2000	(Thanks. I’m still gonna be more careful from now\non, though.)
A3_25160_PIKACHU_200_1000	Hey, Ursaring! Your friend is looking for you.
A3_25160_RINGUMA02_200_1000	(What? Oh, right. I suppose I haven’t been back for\na while.)
A3_25160_PIKACHU_200_2000	You should get back to your friend so it can\nstop worrying.
A3_25160_RINGUMA02_200_2000	(Right. I’ll do that.)
A3_25160_PIKACHU_200_3000	Should we go check in with that Ursaring outside the\nruins too?
A3_25160_RINGUMA02_300_1000	(I can’t go home empty-handed. Better go look for\nsome food.)
A3_25160_PIKACHU_300_1000	Don’t push yourself too hard, Ursaring.
A3_25160_PIKACHU_400_1000	You OK, Ursaring?
A3_25160_PIKACHU_400_2000	You were frozen solid!
A3_25160_RINGUMA02_400_1000	(Yeah, I remember what happened now. The door’s\nusually closed, but then I saw it open at one point.)
A3_25160_RINGUMA02_400_2000	(So I came inside to see if there was any food\nin here.)
A3_25160_RINGUMA02_400_3000	(I guess I must have fallen asleep after that, ’cause I\ndon’t remember anything else...)
A3_25160_PIKACHU_400_3000	Some ice Pokémon froze the ruins, and it looks like\nthey froze you along with ’em.
A3_25160_PIKACHU_400_4000	Sounds like a rough time.
A3_25160_GHIHIDARUMA_400_1000	(I’m sorry we caused you so much trouble.)
A3_25160_RINGUMA02_400_4000	(Oh, don’t worry about it. As you can see, I’m just\nfine now.)
A3_25160_RINGUMA02_400_5000	(Anyway, I can’t go home empty-handed. Better go\nlook for some food.)
A3_25160_PIKACHU_400_5000	Don’t push yourself too hard, Ursaring.
A3_25160_SEL_0_4000	Yes
A3_25160_SEL_0_5000	No
A3_25160_PIKACHU_500_1000	OK, let’s go.
A3_25160_PIKACHU_600_1000	That’s OK. Maybe I’ll check back later.
A3_25310_HAHAKOMORI_200_1000	(I’ll make sure my Swadloon dress warmly for the\ntime being.)
A3_25310_PIKACHU_200_1000	Yeah, that’s a good idea when it’s this cold. You be\ncareful not to catch a cold yourself, either!
A3_25310_HAHAKOMORI_200_2000	(I will. Thank you.)
A3_25310_HAHAKOMORI_300_1000	(Thanks, Pikachu! My dear Swadloon have returned!)
A3_25310_PIKACHU_300_1000	I’m glad they made it back safely.
A3_25310_KURUMAYU01_300_1000	(It’s ’cause you brought us those warm\nclothes, Pikachu!)
A3_25310_PIKACHU_300_2000	Heh heh, don’t worry about it! Just be careful not to\nworry Leavanny too much in the future, OK?
A3_25310_GHIHIDARUMA_300_1000	(Yeah, it’s best when families stick together!)
A3_25310_HAHAKOMORI_400_1000	(I don’t know where else to look...)
A3_25310_PIKACHU_400_1000	I can tell you’re worried about the Swadloon.
A3_25310_PIKACHU_400_2000	Just wait. We’ll find ’em for you.
A3_25310_HAHAKOMORI_500_1000	(*sigh* What could be keeping them?)
A3_25310_PIKACHU_500_1000	It’s a Leavanny.
A3_25310_GHIHIDARUMA_500_1000	(It looks like it’s worried about something...)
A3_25310_PIKACHU_500_2000	Hey, Leavanny! Is something wrong?
A3_25310_HAHAKOMORI_500_2000	(Yes! My Swadloon went off to play, and they\nhaven’t come back!)
A3_25310_HAHAKOMORI_500_3000	(I went looking for them because I’m so worried, but\nI can’t find them anywhere.)
A3_25310_PIKACHU_500_3000	Yeah, I can see why you’re worried when it’s this cold.\nIf we see them, we’ll tell them to head straight back.
A3_25310_PIKACHU_500_4000	How many Swadloon are there?
A3_25310_HAHAKOMORI_500_4000	(Two of them went off to play.)
A3_25310_PIKACHU_500_5000	Two? Got it. Leave those little lost Swadloon to us.
A3_25310_HAHAKOMORI_500_5000	(Are you sure, Pikachu?! You don’t mind?)
A3_25310_PIKACHU_500_6000	Yeah, we’re already investigating the place, so this is\njust one more thing to keep an eye out for. Don’t\nworry about it!
A3_25310_HAHAKOMORI_500_6000	(Thanks. I really appreciate it! And if you do find\nthem, please make sure they put these on.)
A3_25310_GHIHIDARUMA_500_2000	(What are these?)
A3_25310_PIKACHU_500_7000	They’re clothes for Swadloon.
A3_25310_PIKACHU_500_8000	Leavanny uses its sticky silk to weave clothes out\nof leaves.
A3_25310_PIKACHU_500_9000	OK, got it, Leavanny. We’ll search for those Swadloon\nand deliver these clothes to them too.
A3_25310_PIKACHU_500_10000	So you just sit tight and stop worrying.
A3_25310_HAHAKOMORI_500_7000	(Thanks so much, both of you!)
A3_25320_PIKACHU_400_1000	Hello, little Swadloon!
A3_25320_KURUMAYU01_400_1000	(I’m so cold...)
A3_25320_PIKACHU_400_2000	Looks like it didn’t go home because it’s too cold\nto move.
A3_25320_PIKACHU_400_2500	Let’s give it those clothes we got.
A3_25320_KURUMAYU01_400_2000	(Mmm! They’re so waaarm!)
A3_25320_GHIHIDARUMA_400_2000	(Looks like it’s feeling better now.)
A3_25320_PIKACHU_400_3000	Are you well enough to go back to Leavanny now?
A3_25320_PIKACHU_400_4000	It seems really worried about you. You should hurry on\nhome, OK?
A3_25320_KURUMAYU01_400_3000	(I will! Thanks, Pikachu!)
A3_25320_KURUMAYU01_500_1000	(Cold... S-so cold...)
A3_25320_GHIHIDARUMA_500_1000	(This little Swadloon’s all wet! It looks really cold...)
A3_25320_PIKACHU_500_2000	It’s no wonder in this weather. Do we have any way to\nhelp warm it up?
A3_25330_KURUMAYU02_400_1000	(*shiver* I’m so c-cold...)
A3_25330_PIKACHU_400_1000	It’s a Swadloon.
A3_25330_PIKACHU_400_2000	It’s practically frozen. It must be too cold to walk\nback home.
A3_25330_PIKACHU_400_2500	Let’s give it those clothes we got.
A3_25330_KURUMAYU02_400_2000	(Ooh! All warm and toasty!)
A3_25330_PIKACHU_400_3000	Oh good! You seem much better now!
A3_25330_GHIHIDARUMA_400_2000	(Your family’s probably worried about you.)
A3_25330_KURUMAYU02_400_3000	(Oh, right! I gotta get back right away!)
A3_25330_KURUMAYU02_500_1000	(*shiver* I’m so c-cold...)
A3_25330_GHIHIDARUMA_500_1000	(This Swadloon looks really cold! I wish we could do\nsomething to help...)
A3_25330_PIKACHU_500_1000	Yeah, I’d like to help warm it up somehow...
A3_25340_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, we found both of the lost Swadloon.
A3_25340_PIKACHU_100_2000	Wanna head back now to make sure they made it\nhome safe and sound?
A3_25340_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_25340_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_25340_PIKACHU_200_1000	OK, let’s go.
A3_25340_PIKACHU_300_1000	That’s OK. Maybe I’ll check back later.
A3_25350_PIKACHU_300_1000	OK, we found both of the lost Swadloon.
A3_25350_PIKACHU_300_2000	Wanna head back now to make sure they made it\nhome safe and sound?
A3_25350_SEL_0_3000	Yes
A3_25350_SEL_0_4000	No
A3_25350_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK, let’s go.
A3_25350_PIKACHU_500_1000	That’s OK. Maybe I’ll check back later.
A3_2540_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s a mural here too.
A3_2540_TIM_100_1000	But it’s different from the Passimian murals we\nsaw upstairs.
A3_2540_TIM_100_2000	This picture might be a clue of some kind too.
A3_2540_PIKACHU_100_2000	I don’t see anything around here that looks like\na mechanism.
A3_2540_PIKACHU_100_3000	At any rate, right now we should be concentrating on\nfinding the professor.
A3_2550_TIM_100_1000	There’s a big hole in the floor this way. I don’t think\nwe can get across.
A3_2550_TIM_100_2000	It’s really deep, too. The professor probably hasn’t\ncome this way.
A3_2550_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wait, Tim. Look.
A3_25510_TSUBOTSUBO_100_1000	(Waaah! What’s going on?!)
A3_25510_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Huh?! A Pokémon came out of that rock!)
A3_25510_PIKACHU_100_1000	A Shuckle?! I guess it was inside that boulder...
A3_25510_TSUBOTSUBO_100_2000	(Wow... You really startled me! If you’re gonna wake\nme up, be gentler about it next time!)
A3_25510_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’re sorry. We had no idea you were here.
A3_25510_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(Sorry for breaking your rock.)
A3_25510_TSUBOTSUBO_100_3000	(Don’t worry about it. I was just thinking it was about\ntime to get up.)
A3_25510_TSUBOTSUBO_100_4000	(More importantly, though, why is it so cold?! Did I\nsleep all the way until winter?!)
A3_25510_PIKACHU_100_3000	No, it’s just a bit of bad weather. It’ll be OK.
A3_25510_TSUBOTSUBO_100_5000	(Really? Thank goodness.)
A3_25510_TSUBOTSUBO_100_6000	(But still, it’s way too cold right now.)
A3_25510_TSUBOTSUBO_100_7000	(I’d better make myself some nice nutritious juice to\nperk myself up.)
A3_25510_PIKACHU_100_4000	Oh right, I remember! Shuckle can make all sorts of\ndifferent juices inside their shells!
A3_25510_GHIHIDARUMA_100_3000	(Really? Sounds tasty!)
A3_25520_WOMANQUIZ_100_1000	Oh, you’re the detective’s Pikachu!
A3_25520_WOMANQUIZ_100_2000	Wait, what?! Darmanitan can give Pikachu a ride on\nits head?!
A3_25520_WOMANQUIZ_100_3000	I’ve never seen that before! Ohmygosh, I’m so glad I\ncame here today! This made it all worth it!
A3_25520_PIKACHU_100_1000	Uh... Glad to hear it?
A3_25530_MOKUROH_400_1000	(Grrr... You two look really suspicious. What are you\ndoing here, anyway?)
A3_25530_PIKACHU_400_1000	It’s still really wary of us.
A3_25530_GHIHIDARUMA_400_1000	(We’re not gonna do anything to you.)
A3_25530_PIKACHU_500_1000	It’s a Rowlet.
A3_25530_PIKACHU_500_2000	Wait a second. Cute eyes and a round body...
A3_25530_PIKACHU_500_3000	Just like the quiz professor said.
A3_25530_PIKACHU_500_4000	She must have been talking about this Pokémon.
A3_25530_PIKACHU_500_5000	I’ve gotta remember to tell Tim the answer later.
A3_25530_PIKACHU_500_6000	We’ll have to go see the quiz professor.
A3_25530_MOKUROH_600_1000	(Grrr... You two look really suspicious. What are you\ndoing here, anyway?)
A3_25530_PIKACHU_600_1000	Oh, nothing in particular. Sorry if we startled you.
A3_25530_GHIHIDARUMA_600_1000	(Why doesn’t it trust us?)
A3_25530_PIKACHU_600_2000	Well, Rowlet is known for being a wary Pokémon.\nWe should be careful not to get kicked by it.
A3_25530_GHIHIDARUMA_600_2000	(Huh. It’s pretty dangerous for such a cute little\nround thing.)
A3_25540_DENDIMUSHI_400_1000	(More! Gotta eat more!)
A3_25540_GHIHIDARUMA_400_1000	(That’s a funny-looking Pokémon.)
A3_25540_PIKACHU_400_1000	It’s so focused on eating that it doesn’t seem to have\nnoticed us at all.
A3_25540_DENDIMUSHI_500_1000	(Gotta store more electricity!)
A3_25540_GHIHIDARUMA_500_1000	(That’s a funny-looking Pokémon.)
A3_25540_PIKACHU_500_1000	Yeah, that’s Charjabug. Blocky-lookin’ fella, isn’t it?
A3_25540_PIKACHU_500_2000	Wait a sec—this must be the Pokémon the quiz\nprofessor was talking about!
A3_25540_PIKACHU_500_3000	All right, I’ll tell Tim later that I found the answer.
A3_25540_DENDIMUSHI_600_1000	(I gotta eat a ton so I can make loads of electricity.)
A3_25540_GHIHIDARUMA_600_1000	(That’s a funny-looking Pokémon.)
A3_25540_PIKACHU_600_1000	Yeah, that’s Charjabug. Blocky-lookin’ fella, isn’t it?
A3_25550_WATASHIRAGA_400_1000	(When the weather is this bad, it causes so much\ntrouble for everyone here!)
A3_25550_PIKACHU_400_1000	You look warm, though. I’d love to have some of that\ncotton myself.
A3_25550_GHIHIDARUMA_500_1000	(Wow! It’s so fluffy!)
A3_25550_PIKACHU_500_1000	Eldegoss, huh? It sure is fluffy... Just like the quiz\nprofessor said.
A3_25550_PIKACHU_500_2000	This must be the answer to her question. I’ll tell\nTim later.
A3_25550_WATASHIRAGA_600_1000	(Weather like this really takes a toll on me.)
A3_25550_GHIHIDARUMA_600_1000	(Wow! This fluffy Pokémon looks so soft!)
A3_25550_PIKACHU_600_1000	That’s ’cause Eldegoss is covered in cotton.
A3_25550_PIKACHU_600_2000	That cotton sure looks warm.
A3_25610_PIKACHU_300_1000	Well, we did find that strange rock earlier.
A3_25610_GHIHIDARUMA_300_1000	(You mean this pretty stone? Sure, I’ll show it to him!\nHere you go!)
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_300_2000	*gasp* Is that really Old Amber?!
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_300_3000	This fossil contains the DNA of the dinosaur\nPokémon Aerodactyl!
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_300_4000	It’s a fearsome, ferocious Pokémon that ruled the\nskies in prehistoric times!
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_300_5000	However, this is not what I’ve been searching for.
A3_25610_PIKACHU_300_2000	Huh. Guess we didn’t hit the jackpot.
A3_25610_GHIHIDARUMA_300_2000	(But he looked so happy! Humans sure\nare complicated.)
A3_25610_JIGUZAGUMA_300_1000	(I’m sorry. And after you went out of your way to find\nthat and bring it to us...)
A3_25610_PIKACHU_600_1000	Darmanitan, show him that flat rock we found.
A3_25610_GHIHIDARUMA_600_1000	(Just looks like a rock you could find\nanywhere... Here!)
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_600_2000	O-oh my goodness—that’s an Armor Fossil!
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_600_3000	If you restore this fossil, it’ll become a Pokémon\ncalled Shieldon!
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_600_4000	It’s said to have an incredibly durable face that can\nwithstand even the strongest attacks.
A3_25610_PIKACHU_600_2000	Apparently it’s a fossil of a super tough Pokémon.
A3_25610_GHIHIDARUMA_600_2000	(That’s a Pokémon? But it really does just look like\na rock!)
A3_25610_JIGUZAGUMA_600_1000	(You two are good at finding fossils!)
A3_25610_PIKACHU_900_1000	Darmanitan, do you have that round rock we found?
A3_25610_GHIHIDARUMA_900_1000	(You want me to give this to him? OK, here.)
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_900_2000	Well, as I live and breathe! This is a rare and valuable\nSkull Fossil!
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_900_3000	If you restore this fossil, it’ll become a Cranidos!
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_900_4000	It’s said to be tremendously powerful—able to\npulverize anything with just a headbutt!
A3_25610_PIKACHU_900_2000	Sounds like it could give you a run for your money in\nterms of power, Darmanitan.
A3_25610_GHIHIDARUMA_900_2000	(It must have been a really amazing Pokémon.)
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_900_5000	This fossil is in remarkably good condition too...
A3_25610_JIGUZAGUMA_900_1000	(It sounds like you found something really wonderful\nfor us! Thank you so much!)
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1100_1000	Now I’ve got both a Skull Fossil and an Armor Fossil!
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1100_2000	Marvelous! What a tremendous haul! I can present\nthese findings at the next academic conference!
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1100_3000	This will do wonders to further the progress of all\nresearch into Fossil Pokémon!
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1100_4000	Don’t worry—I’ll be sure to properly credit you for\nyour contributions. Thanks so much!
A3_25610_JIGUZAGUMA_1100_1000	(Thank you so much! I’m so glad I didn’t end up\nmaking my partner sad.)
A3_25610_GHIHIDARUMA_1100_1000	(They both seem really happy. Does that mean we did\nsomething good?)
A3_25610_PIKACHU_1100_1000	We sure did. And it’s all thanks to you, Darmanitan.
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1200_1000	Please...please help me with my fossil collection!
A3_25610_PIKACHU_1200_1000	What an intense stare... Yeesh!
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1300_1000	Wh-wha—? Who are you two?
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1300_2000	Are you the beam of hope that will pierce through the\ndark sorrow in my heart?
A3_25610_PIKACHU_1300_1000	Whoa, he’s looking at us with desperation in\nhis eyes...
A3_25610_GHIHIDARUMA_1300_1000	(You think we should avoid him?)
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1300_3000	Wait! Please, wait. I don’t know if you understand\nwhat I’m saying, but...
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1300_4000	please lend me your immeasurable power!
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1300_5000	Could you find it in your heart to break open\nboulders and bring me any fossils you find?
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1300_6000	My partner Zigzagoon’s toes are frozen stiff from\nthe cold.
A3_25610_JIGUZAGUMA_1400_1000	(Look at my paws!)
A3_25610_PIKACHU_1400_1000	Oh wow. Those are some icy-looking toes.
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1400_1000	And so, I need your help—I beg of you!
A3_25610_GHIHIDARUMA_1400_1000	(He really does sound desperate.)
A3_25610_PIKACHU_1400_2000	Yep. Looks like we’ve just been made honorary\nfossil excavators.
A3_25610_PIKACHU_1400_3000	He’s really counting on your punching power.
A3_25610_JIGUZAGUMA_1400_2000	(Normally I would break the boulders myself, but I just\ncan’t do it right now...)
A3_25610_JIGUZAGUMA_1400_3000	(Please! Won’t you help us?)
A3_25610_PIKACHU_1400_4000	It’s hard to say no to that. Sure, we’ll help you.
A3_25610_GHIHIDARUMA_1400_2000	(But which boulder should I break?)
A3_25610_PIKACHU_1400_5000	True, we’re not experts. We can’t tell by looking which\nones are likely to have fossils in them.
A3_25610_PIKACHU_1400_6000	I guess we’ve just gotta break any boulder that looks\nlike a likely candidate.
A3_25610_GHIHIDARUMA_1400_3000	(Got it! I’ll be careful not to break the fossils along\nwith the boulders!)
A3_25610_JIGUZAGUMA_1400_4000	(Thank you! We really really appreciate it!)
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1400_2000	Oh, you’re willing to help?
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1400_3000	I’ve been searching for an Armor Fossil and a\nSkull Fossil.
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1400_4000	Please find them for me!
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1600_1000	Oh, it’s you two! Have you discovered anything?
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1700_1000	How goes the search? Have you made any\ndiscoveries?
A3_25610_HAMANOLD01_1800_1000	Well now! I’ve been waiting for you! Any discoveries?
A3_2565_TIM_100_1000	Do you think that hat belongs to Professor Gordon?
A3_2565_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks that way.
A3_2565_PIKACHU_100_2000	Well, we found a clue, but how did he get across?
A3_2565_YADON_100_1000	Slooow.
A3_2565_RACHEL_100_1000	Wait, Slowpoke!
A3_2565_TIM_100_2000	Did I just hear—
A3_2565_RACHEL_100_2000	Oh, thank goodness he stopped.
A3_2565_TIM_100_3000	What’s going on, Rachel?
A3_2565_RACHEL_100_3000	I have no idea. Slowpoke just suddenly took\noff running...
A3_2565_YADON_100_2000	Slooow!
A3_2565_PIKACHU_100_3000	He says if Mr. Go went this way, he wants to go too.
A3_2565_PIKACHU_100_4000	But look at this hole, Slowpoke. Isn’t it obvious that\nwe can’t get across?
A3_2565_YADON_100_3000	Slow.
A3_2565_PIKACHU_100_5000	Really, Slowpoke? You’ve got a brilliant plan?
A3_2565_TIM_100_4000	It’d be great if Slowpoke could help us somehow, but\nare you sure that’s a good idea?
A3_2565_YADON_100_4000	Slooow.
A3_2565_PIKACHU_100_6000	We’ll leave it to you, then.
A3_25670_PIKACHU_100_1000	Huh? Some sort of flat rock came out.
A3_25670_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(What is this? It just looks like a rock to me...)
A3_25670_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hmmm... I dunno. Its shape seems too distinct to be\njust a rock.
A3_25670_PIKACHU_100_3000	I think we should at least show it to that collector guy.
A3_25680_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hm? There’s something here.
A3_25680_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(What’s this pretty rock? And why’s it got junk stuck\ninside it?)
A3_25680_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’ve never seen a rock like this before.
A3_25680_PIKACHU_100_3000	It might be one of those fossils the collector was\ntalking about. Let’s go show him.
A3_25690_PIKACHU_100_1000	Whoa! Some kinda round rock came tumbling out!
A3_25690_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(What’s this? Let’s play kickball with it!)
A3_25690_PIKACHU_100_2000	No, wait! Don’t kick it away. It looks different from\nthe other rocks.
A3_25690_PIKACHU_100_3000	It’s a bit of a walk, but let’s go show this to\nthat collector.
A3_25720_IWAPALACE_100_1000	(If you break my beautiful boulder, I’m going to be\nvery, very upset!)
A3_25720_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, we’ll be more careful from now on.
A3_25725_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Huh? What’s with this weird boulder?)
A3_25725_PIKACHU_100_1000	It definitely looks different from all the others.
A3_25725_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(Can I smash this one too?)
A3_25725_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, it should be fine. Just be careful.
A3_25740_IWAPALACE_100_1000	(Gaahh!)
A3_25740_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Huh? Did that boulder just talk?!)
A3_25740_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s not a boulder! That’s a Crustle!
A3_25740_PIKACHU_100_2000	It’s a Pokémon that lives in the boulder it carries on\nits back.
A3_25740_IWAPALACE_100_2000	(Goodness gracious! What do you think you’re\ndoing?!)
A3_25740_IWAPALACE_100_3000	(You could have smashed my favorite boulder here!\nWhat would I have done, then?!)
A3_25740_PIKACHU_100_3000	We’re sorry. He really didn’t mean any harm. Please\nforgive him.
A3_25740_IWAPALACE_100_4000	(Well, I never!)
A3_25740_PIKACHU_100_4000	Phew. Guess you’d better check next time before\nyou punch a boulder.
A3_25740_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(I didn’t know there were Pokémon that carry\nboulders on their backs...)
A3_2575_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wow! He completely filled it with water!\nBut how are we supposed to get across?
A3_2575_YADON_100_1000	Slooow!
A3_2575_TIM_100_1000	Huh?
A3_2575_PIKACHU_100_2000	H-hey, wait!
A3_25810_SOLROCK_400_1000	(I hope the weather warms up soon...)
A3_25810_PIKACHU_400_1000	It will. Just hang in there a bit longer.
A3_25810_PIKACHU_500_1000	Everything’s OK now, Solrock.
A3_25810_PIKACHU_500_2000	Eiscue promised to turn the climate back to normal.
A3_25810_SOLROCK_500_1000	(Really?! Oh, what a relief!)
A3_25810_PIKACHU_500_3000	I think it’ll still take some time for the weather to\nclear up, though.
A3_25810_PIKACHU_500_4000	You’ll be OK till then, right?
A3_25810_SOLROCK_500_2000	(Yes, of course!)
A3_25810_SOLROCK_500_3000	(Oh, I am so looking forward to the sun coming back!)
A3_25810_SOLROCK_600_1000	(*sigh* I miss the sun so much...)
A3_25810_PIKACHU_600_1000	This weather must be really hard on Solrock.
A3_25810_SOLROCK_700_1000	(*sigh* I miss the sun so much...)
A3_25810_PIKACHU_700_1000	Oh, a Solrock. You don’t look too happy.
A3_25810_SOLROCK_700_2000	(Well, the weather’s been awful here for a while now,\nyou know?)
A3_25810_SOLROCK_700_3000	(Because of that, I haven’t been able to soak up\nenough sunlight. I’ve got no energy now...)
A3_25810_GHIHIDARUMA_700_1000	(But...isn’t it better if it’s snowing all the time?)
A3_25810_PIKACHU_700_2000	Solrock is powered by solar energy.
A3_25810_PIKACHU_700_3000	It’s built differently from you and your friends from\ncolder climates.
A3_25810_GHIHIDARUMA_700_2000	(Oh wow. I didn’t know there were Pokémon\nlike that...)
A3_25810_SOLROCK_800_1000	(*sigh* I miss the sun so much...)
A3_25810_PIKACHU_800_1000	Oh, a Solrock. You don’t look too happy.
A3_25810_SOLROCK_800_2000	(Well, the weather’s been awful here for a while now,\nyou know?)
A3_25810_SOLROCK_800_3000	(Because of that, I haven’t been able to soak up\nenough sunlight. I’ve got no energy now...)
A3_25810_PIKACHU_800_2000	Everything’s OK now, Solrock.
A3_25810_PIKACHU_800_3000	Eiscue promised to turn the climate back to normal.
A3_25810_SOLROCK_800_4000	(Really?! Oh, what a relief!)
A3_25810_PIKACHU_800_4000	But I think it’ll take a little time for the weather to\nclear up.
A3_25810_PIKACHU_800_5000	So hang in there for just a little longer, OK?
A3_25810_SOLROCK_800_5000	(Yes, of course!)
A3_25810_SOLROCK_800_6000	(Oh, I am so looking forward to the sun coming back!)
A3_2585_TIM_100_1000	He swam ahead on his own...
A3_2585_PIKACHU_100_1000	That Slowpoke is a real handful...
A3_2590_RACHEL_100_1000	I hope we can find a way to get across...
A3_2590_RACHEL_100_2000	If we can’t find a way across, do you think we’ll have\nto jump? I wonder if I can even jump that far...
A3_25910_PY01_200_1000	(Thank you!)
A3_25910_PIKACHU_200_1000	No problem.
A3_25910_PY01_300_1000	(Thanks for finding everybody!)
A3_25910_PIKACHU_300_1000	We found all the Cleffa that were playing hide-and-\nseek for you.
A3_25910_PY01_300_2000	(Yay! We’re about to head out on a trip to a hill that’s\nkinda far away.)
A3_25910_PY01_300_3000	(We go there a lot ’cause the view is so pretty on\nnights with lots of shooting stars!)
A3_25910_PIKACHU_300_2000	I see! I hope you’re able to see some tonight.
A3_25910_PIKACHU_300_3000	I’m just happy to see you so pleased.
A3_25910_PY01_400_1000	(There are three of them in total! Please, find them\nfor me!)
A3_25910_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Just wait a bit.
A3_25910_PY01_500_1000	(Ahhh, where did everybody go?!)
A3_25910_PIKACHU_500_1000	What’s wrong? Are you lost?
A3_25910_PY01_500_2000	(No, I’m playing hide-and-seek!)
A3_25910_PY01_500_3000	(But I can’t find the others! They’re just too good at\nthis game!)
A3_25910_PIKACHU_500_2000	Well, this area around the ruins is pretty big.
A3_25910_PY01_500_4000	(We’ve got other plans after this, but at this rate, we\nwon’t make it in time...)
A3_25910_PY01_500_5000	(Hey, could you help me find my friends? Pleeease?!)
A3_25910_GHIHIDARUMA_500_1000	(Poor little thing. I feel sorry for it.)
A3_25910_PIKACHU_500_3000	Oh, OK. We’ll help out just this once.
A3_25910_PY01_500_6000	(Really?!)
A3_25910_PIKACHU_500_4000	How many friends do you need us to find?
A3_25910_PY01_500_7000	(Um, lemme see... Three!)
A3_25910_PIKACHU_500_5000	Three of ’em, eh? Got it! Just leave the rest to us!
A3_25920_PY02_200_1000	(Who are you two?!)
A3_25920_PIKACHU_200_1000	You’re one of the Cleffa playing hide-and-seek, right?
A3_25920_PIKACHU_200_2000	Your friend asked us to help find you.
A3_25920_PY02_200_2000	(Aww, that’s cheating!)
A3_25920_PIKACHU_200_3000	C’mon, stop complaining. Don’t you have other plans\nafter this anyway?
A3_25920_PY02_200_3000	(Oh, that’s right! I gotta get moving!)
A3_25920_PIKACHU_200_4000	Be careful on your way back!
A3_25920_PIKACHU_300_1000	What are you doing here?
A3_25920_PY02_300_1000	(Shhh! Don’t talk to me! I’ll get found!)
A3_25920_GHIHIDARUMA_300_1000	(Maybe it’s playing hide-and-seek.)
A3_25930_PY03_200_500	(Eep! You scared me!)
A3_25930_PIKACHU_200_500	Oh, there’s a Cleffa hiding here.
A3_25930_PY03_200_1000	(Awww, I was so sure nobody would find me here.)
A3_25930_PIKACHU_200_1000	You found a good hiding spot, but not good enough.\nBesides, you’ve got plans you’re gonna be late for!
A3_25930_PY03_200_2000	(Wha—? Is it that late already? Thanks for telling\nme! See ya!)
A3_25930_PY03_300_1000	(Eep! That rock suddenly exploded!)
A3_25930_PIKACHU_300_1000	Well, THIS is a surprise. I didn’t expect to find a\nCleffa here.
A3_25930_PY03_300_2000	(With the rock broken, they’ll find me right away...\nWhat do I do now?)
A3_25940_PY04_200_1000	(What are you doing?)
A3_25940_PIKACHU_200_1000	We’re helping out your friend who’s looking for you!
A3_25940_PIKACHU_200_2000	It asked us to help find you all since you’ve got other\nplans coming up.
A3_25940_PY04_200_2000	(I can’t believe you found me. I was so sure no one\nwould catch me here.)
A3_25940_PIKACHU_200_3000	Nothing gets past a great detective.
A3_25940_PIKACHU_200_4000	Anyway, hide-and-seek’s all finished. Go on back to\nyour friend.
A3_25940_PY04_200_3000	(Oh, OK...)
A3_25940_PY04_300_1000	(Are you OK? Did you know there’s a Pikachu stuck\nin your head?)
A3_25940_GHIHIDARUMA_300_1000	(He’s not stuck. I’m giving him a ride!)
A3_25940_PIKACHU_300_1000	Heh heh! Pretty cool, huh?
A3_25945_PIKACHU_100_1000	I think we’ve found all the Cleffa we were asked\nto find.
A3_25945_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s head back and see how things are going.
A3_2595_TIM_100_1000	It doesn’t look like we can get across this hole on\nour own.
A3_2595_PIKACHU_100_1000	We need to think of a way to get across.
A3_25950_TSUBOTSUBO_100_1000	(Oof... It’s so cold! I’d better hurry and make\nsome juice!)
A3_25950_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yep! Whip up some delicious juice to give yourself a\nboost of energy!
A3_2615_TIM_100_1000	Look, now we’ve got a Lotad bridge!
A3_2615_HASSBOH01_100_1000	Lo!
A3_2615_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s telling us to walk across the leaves on their heads.
A3_2615_TIM_100_2000	Thanks, Lotad.
A3_2615_HASSBOH02_100_1000	Lo lotad!
A3_2620_RACHEL_100_1000	I can’t believe we get to float on Lotad! This is like\nsomething out of a dream!
A3_2620_RACHEL_100_2000	You really are incredible, Tim. You get along so well\nwith Pokémon!
A3_2630_TIM_100_1000	All right. Thanks to these Lotad, we made it across!
A3_2630_PIKACHU_100_1000	Tim, ask Rachel about the hat!
A3_2630_TIM_100_2000	Hey, Rachel. Is this Professor Gordon’s hat?
A3_2630_RACHEL_100_1000	Yes, it’s definitely the professor’s. He said he and\nSlowpoke wear matching hats.
A3_2630_RACHEL_100_2000	Apparently he’s really picky about hats, too, and this\none’s his favorite.
A3_2630_TIM_100_3000	Oh, really? We’d better get this hat back to him, then!
A3_2630_PIKACHU_100_2000	If you wanna be a first-class guy, you’ve gotta have a\ngood hat.
A3_2630_PIKACHU_100_3000	Gordon should be up ahead somewhere. Let’s\nhurry, Tim.
A3_2640_TIM_100_1000	We’re gonna cross now, Lotad. Thanks again for\nyour help!
A3_2640_HASSBOH01_100_1000	Lotaaad.
A3_2650_PIKACHU_100_1000	Sorry, we’ll just be stepping across for a second.
A3_2650_HASSBOH01_100_1000	Lo lo.
A3_2660_RACHEL_100_1000	Be careful, Tim.
A3_2670_TIM_100_1333	That rubble looks like it collapsed recently.
A3_2670_PIKACHU_100_2000	Do you think it collapsed naturally...or do you think\nsomeone did this?
A3_2670_TIM_100_2666	The professor might be just past here.
A3_2670_PIKACHU_100_4000	But there’s all this rubble and debris in the way.\nWe won’t be able to get through here.
A3_2670_TIM_100_4000	I wonder if there’s anything we can do...
A3_2680_RACHEL_100_1000	We need to get all this rubble out of the way so we\ncan get past.
A3_2690_YADON_100_1000	Slooow! Slooow!
A3_2690_PIKACHU_100_1000	Calm down, Slowpoke!
A3_2690_PIKACHU_100_2000	We just have to figure out how to get past\nthis mess here.
A3_2700_PIKACHU_100_1000	What do you think, Tim? Can we move this stuff?
A3_2700_TIM_100_1000	I don’t think there’s any way we can move this rubble\nourselves.
A3_2700_PIKACHU_100_2000	That’s too bad... Guess we’ll have to find another\nway through.
A3_2705_SECRETGHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Darmaaa!
A3_2705_TIM_100_1000	What was that?! It sounded like a Pokémon cry...
A3_2720_PIKACHU_100_1000	What’s an ice Pokémon doing here?
A3_2720_TIM_100_1000	It sure seems angry. I feel like things could get ugly if\nit sees us.
A3_2720_PIKACHU_100_2000	If we’re gonna go any farther, we’d better be careful \nnot to let it spot us.
A3_2720_PIKACHU_100_3000	Looks like there are plenty of places for us to hide,\nthough. Guess that’s something to be thankful for.
A3_2720_TIM_100_2000	Yeah, that’s true. Let’s keep out of its sight and get\nthrough here.
A3_2750_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, wait. Where are you going? We’ve gotta get\nthrough here first, don’t we?
A3_2770_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, where are you going?
A3_2770_PIKACHU_100_2000	Darmanitan is that way. If we get too close, it’ll send\nus flying!
A3_2790_TIM_100_1000	This way looks like a dead end. Where could the\nprofessor have gone?
A3_2790_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m pretty sure we haven’t passed him... Wait, huh?
A3_2790_TIM_100_2000	What is it, Pikachu?
A3_2790_PIKACHU_100_2000	Did you feel a breeze just now?
A3_2790_TIM_100_3000	No, I didn’t feel anything. Are you sure you aren’t\nimagining things?
A3_2790_PIKACHU_100_3000	No, it was definitely real. I felt it ruffle my fur.
A3_2790_PIKACHU_100_4000	There must be a gap somewhere. C’mon, Tim, let’s\nsearch for it.
A3_2800_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Tim! We found it! There’s a gap in the wall here!
A3_2800_TIM_100_1000	Let me get a closer look...
A3_2807_TIM_100_1000	What do we do now? There’s no way to get through\na hole this small...
A3_2807_PIKACHU_100_1000	What’re you talkin’ about? It’s no problem at all!
A3_2807_TIM_100_2000	Huh?
A3_2807_PIKACHU_100_2000	Just who do you think I am? Situations like this are\nwhere the great Detective Pikachu truly shines!
A3_2807_TIM_100_3000	Are you sure you’ll be OK? It looks pretty tough to\ncrawl through...
A3_2807_PIKACHU_100_3000	Like I always say—you gotta use those legs while\ninvestigating! Lemme show you how it’s done!
A3_2807_TIM_100_4000	If you insist...
A3_2920_PIKACHU_100_1000	Ah, so that’s Gordon.
A3_2920_PIKACHU_100_2000	I guess I should get a closer look.
A3_29210_PIKACHU_100_1000	Gordon’s bag sure looks like a proper\nadventurer’s bag!
A3_29210_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(But it looks like there’s no food in it. That’s too bad.)
A3_2940_GORDON_100_1000	Hmm... Are you hungry or something?
A3_2940_PIKACHU_100_1000	No, I’m not hungry! I’ve come here to rescue you!
A3_2940_GORDON_100_2000	I’m sorry, little fella. I’d really like to help you, but I\ndon’t have any food to share.
A3_2940_GORDON_100_3000	I dropped almost all the food I had on me when I was\nrunning from Darmanitan.
A3_2940_GORDON_100_4000	I mean, that’s probably what saved me, but still...
A3_2940_PIKACHU_100_2000	Huh? What’s he talking about?
A3_2940_GORDON_100_5000	I swear, that Darmanitan’s whole attitude changed the\nmoment it saw the food.
A3_2940_GORDON_100_6000	It must’ve been hungry, just like you.
A3_2940_PIKACHU_100_3000	So Darmanitan’s only rampaging because it’s hungry?
A3_2940_GORDON_100_7000	But if it really was just hungry, it could have gone\nsomewhere else to search for food.
A3_2940_GORDON_100_8000	Why is it still sticking around here?
A3_2940_GORDON_100_9000	It’s already been two whole days! Darmanitan’s gotta\nbe getting tired of this too!
A3_2940_PIKACHU_100_4000	Got it. So, there’s no food down here, which is why\nDarmanitan is hungry...
A3_2940_PIKACHU_100_5000	But Darmanitan wouldn’t choose a place with no food\nto be its home, so what’s it doing here?
A3_2940_PIKACHU_100_6000	Hmm... But the more important issue right now is how\nto save Gordon.
A3_2940_PIKACHU_100_7000	I’d better look for an exit somewhere.
A3_2940_GORDON_100_10000	Oh, leaving already?
A3_2940_GORDON_100_11000	Be careful, little fella. Darmanitan’s really on a\nrampage out there.
A3_2940_PIKACHU_100_8000	You just wait here, Gordon. I’ll figure something out.
A3_2950_GORDON_100_1000	Oh, you’re still here, little Pikachu?
A3_2950_GORDON_100_2000	I already told you I don’t have any food.
A3_2950_PIKACHU_100_1000	And I already told YOU that I’m here to help you!
A3_2950_GORDON_100_3000	If only you could understand human speech, I could\nsend you to get help.
A3_2950_PIKACHU_100_2000	Argh! It’s SO frustrating not being able to\ncommunicate!
A3_2950_PIKACHU_100_3000	Anyway, you just wait. I’ll save you—you’ll see!
A3_2950_GORDON_200_1000	Watch out for that Darmanitan out there.
A3_2960_PIKACHU_100_1000	I can’t go back until I’ve found a way to save Gordon.
A3_2970_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, here’s another mural.
A3_2970_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’m just guessing here, but this might be another clue\nto some kinda mechanism...
A3_2970_PIKACHU_100_3000	This mural can wait till later. There’s other stuff to\ndeal with right now.
A3_2975_PIKACHU_100_1000	This mural can wait till later. There’s other stuff to\ndeal with right now.
A3_2980_PIKACHU_100_1000	As far as I can tell, this is the only doorway that\nGordon can fit through.
A3_2983_PIKACHU_100_1000	There are no gaps big enough for a person to\nfit through.
A3_2983_PIKACHU_100_2000	I guess we need to figure out how to get all this\nrubble out of the way.
A3_2983_PIKACHU_100_3000	There’s no way Tim and I can clear it on our own.
A3_2983_PIKACHU_100_4000	Now, if we were as strong as Darmanitan, then we\ncould probably—
A3_2983_PIKACHU_100_5000	Wait a minute! Didn’t Gordon say Darmanitan was\nhungry? And Slowpoke gave me something earlier...
A3_2983_PIKACHU_100_6000	I bet I can use this! I should get back to Tim\nright away!
A3_2983_PIKACHU_100_7000	I just came up with a brilliant plan!
A3_2985_PIKACHU_100_1000	I need to hurry back to Tim!
A3_3000_PIKACHU_100_1000	Phew... At least I managed to make it through by\nmyself this time.
A3_3000_TIM_100_1000	I guess you must have figured out the trick to it.\nAnyway, how is the professor doing?
A3_3000_PIKACHU_100_2000	Apparently he’s been trapped in there for two\nwhole days.
A3_3000_TIM_100_2000	This is bad! We’ve gotta hurry and save him!
A3_3000_PIKACHU_100_3000	And the only way out is through that area that’s\nblocked off by all the rubble.
A3_3000_TIM_100_3000	Oh no... There’s no way to get him out!
A3_3000_PIKACHU_100_4000	Don’t panic, Tim. I’ve got a great plan.
A3_3000_TIM_100_4000	What is it?
A3_3000_PIKACHU_100_5000	We’re gonna get Darmanitan to break through all\nthat rubble for us!
A3_3000_TIM_100_5000	What do you mean?
A3_3000_PIKACHU_100_6000	According to Gordon, that Darmanitan is\nreally hungry.
A3_3000_PIKACHU_100_7000	So I figured we could win it over by giving it some\nfood!
A3_3000_TIM_100_6000	But the only food we have is a few leftover Berries.
A3_3000_PIKACHU_100_8000	Hey, aren’t you forgetting about this?
A3_3000_TIM_100_7000	Slowpoke’s tail?
A3_3000_PIKACHU_100_9000	Yeah. It’s really sweet. Just eating one makes you\nfeel happy.
A3_3000_PIKACHU_100_10000	So we’ll feed this to the hungry Darmanitan!
A3_3000_PIKACHU_100_11000	If we do that, we’ll be friends in no time!
A3_3000_TIM_100_8000	I hope it’s really that easy...
A3_3000_PIKACHU_100_12000	Don’t worry so much, Tim. Now c’mon—let’s go back\nto Darmanitan!
A3_3000_TIM_100_9000	OK!
A3_30010_RINGUMA02_100_1000	*groan*
A3_3020_TIM_100_1000	Darmanitan seems really happy.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_100_1000	See? My plan worked out great!
A3_3020_TIM_100_2000	Sheesh. You sure know how to worry people...
A3_3020_PIKACHU_100_2000	OK, Darmanitan...
A3_3020_PIKACHU_100_3000	You understand now that we’re not bad guys, right?
A3_3020_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Darman.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_100_4000	Good. Just wanted to be clear on that.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_100_5000	More importantly, there are a bunch of things\nwe’re curious about.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_100_6000	Do you mind if we ask you some questions?
A3_3020_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Dar dar.
A3_3020_SEL_0_1000	About you, Darmanitan...
A3_3020_SEL_0_2000	Why did you freeze the ruins?
A3_3020_SEL_0_3000	Where did you come from?
A3_3020_SEL_0_4000	About the people dressed in white...
A3_3020_PIKACHU_300_1000	You’re not originally from this area, are you?
A3_3020_PIKACHU_300_2000	What brought you here?
A3_3020_GHIHIDARUMA_300_1000	Dar darman!
A3_3020_PIKACHU_300_3000	Huh? Some people dressed in white caught you and\nshut you in a small space?
A3_3020_TIM_300_1000	What people dressed in white?
A3_3020_GHIHIDARUMA_300_2000	Darma darma!
A3_3020_PIKACHU_300_4000	Darmanitan doesn’t know exactly who they were.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_300_5000	But he hated the small space he was trapped in, so he\nran away with the others who were stuck there.
A3_3020_TIM_300_2000	Hmm, a small space...
A3_3020_PIKACHU_300_6000	It must have been some sort of facility.
A3_3020_GHIHIDARUMA_300_3000	Daaar.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_300_7000	It sounds like the people were doing experiments of\nsome kind on the captured Pokémon.
A3_3020_TIM_300_3000	That’s awful!
A3_3020_PIKACHU_300_8000	You said there were others, Darmanitan. Are your\nfriends around here too?
A3_3020_GHIHIDARUMA_300_4000	Dar dar.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_300_9000	He says some friends escaped with him.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_300_10000	And together, you all froze the ruins?!
A3_3020_PIKACHU_400_1000	So you and your friends froze the ruins? Why would\nyou do that?
A3_3020_GHIHIDARUMA_400_1000	Dar darman!
A3_3020_PIKACHU_400_2000	He says they can’t go back to where they came from.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_400_3000	So they were trying to make this place their new home\nand make it easier for them to live here.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_400_4000	But...didn’t you realize that would cause problems for\nthe Pokémon that already live around here?
A3_3020_GHIHIDARUMA_400_2000	Darman...
A3_3020_PIKACHU_400_5000	He says they didn’t think it’d be a problem if they\nonly froze the place a little bit.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_400_6000	But apparently, it’d been so long since they’d been\nable to have fun like that, they got carried away.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_400_7000	They really didn’t mean any harm.
A3_3020_TIM_400_1000	Even so, we can’t just leave things like this.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_400_8000	You’re right.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_400_9000	Hey, can you do something about all this ice?
A3_3020_GHIHIDARUMA_400_3000	Daaar...
A3_3020_PIKACHU_400_10000	If you do that, this place’ll be too hot for you to\nlive in?
A3_3020_PIKACHU_400_11000	Can’t you live somewhere else?
A3_3020_GHIHIDARUMA_400_4000	Darman!
A3_3020_PIKACHU_400_12000	Ah, he says he doesn’t want to go anywhere else\nbecause there are humans out there.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_400_13000	Hmm... This is a real problem.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_500_1000	You said you were brought here against your will, but\nwhere did you live before?
A3_3020_GHIHIDARUMA_500_1000	Darmaaan!
A3_3020_PIKACHU_500_2000	Mmhmm, I see. He says he came from somewhere\ncold and far away from here.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_500_3000	I’m guessing his friends were captured and brought\nhere along with him.
A3_3020_GHIHIDARUMA_500_2000	Dar...
A3_3020_PIKACHU_500_4000	Everywhere around here is too hot to live in, huh?
A3_3020_TIM_500_1000	Yeah, the climate here definitely isn’t great for\nice Pokémon.
A3_3020_TIM_500_2000	It’d be great if we could help them get back to their\noriginal home.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_600_1000	What can you tell us about the people who brought\nyou here? The ones dressed in white?
A3_3020_GHIHIDARUMA_600_1000	Dar darman!
A3_3020_PIKACHU_600_2000	He doesn’t know much.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_600_3000	But he says they’re all really bad people who were\nmean to him.
A3_3020_TIM_600_1000	It must have been a horrible experience.
A3_3020_GHIHIDARUMA_600_2000	Dar! Dar!
A3_3020_PIKACHU_600_4000	And apparently, right when he arrived here, he saw\nsomeone suspicious.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_600_5000	Wait, you trapped him in a room so he couldn’t do\nanything bad?!
A3_3020_TIM_600_2000	You don’t think he’s talking about Professor Gordon,\ndo you?!
A3_3020_PIKACHU_600_6000	I’m certain he is. It fits with what Gordon said.
A3_3020_PIKACHU_600_7000	Hey, Darmanitan. That wasn’t a bad guy.
A3_3020_GHIHIDARUMA_600_3000	Daaar?
A3_3020_PIKACHU_600_8000	Yeah, really. I can vouch for him.
A3_3020_GHIHIDARUMA_600_4000	Darman...
A3_3020_TIM_600_3000	Does he believe you, Pikachu?
A3_3020_PIKACHU_600_9000	I’m not sure. It seems like he’s still not quite\nconvinced.
A3_3030_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thanks for telling us all that, Darmanitan.
A3_3030_PIKACHU_100_2000	Now let’s get down to the problem at hand.
A3_3030_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar?
A3_3030_PIKACHU_100_3000	That man you said you trapped in the room...\nYou think you could help us let him out?
A3_3030_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Darman?!
A3_3030_PIKACHU_100_4000	Please, Darmanitan. We really need your help!
A3_3030_PIKACHU_100_5000	C’mon, we gave you that Slowpoke tail, remember?
A3_3030_TIM_100_1000	You’re the only one who can rescue the professor!
A3_3030_GHIHIDARUMA_100_3000	Daaar...
A3_3030_PIKACHU_100_6000	Oh, good. I’m glad you trust us.
A3_3030_GHIHIDARUMA_100_4000	Dar!
A3_3030_PIKACHU_100_7000	But there’s a condition?
A3_3030_GHIHIDARUMA_100_5000	Dar darman!
A3_3030_PIKACHU_100_8000	Your friends all got separated in the ruins, and they\nhaven’t come back?
A3_3030_PIKACHU_100_9000	And since you don’t know where they are, you want\nus to help look for them, huh?
A3_3030_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... Now that you mention it, I haven’t seen any\nother ice Pokémon besides Darmanitan here.
A3_3030_PIKACHU_100_10000	He says they’re all just playing around in the ruins.
A3_3030_GHIHIDARUMA_100_6000	Darman!
A3_3030_PIKACHU_100_11000	He’s worried about them and wants to check on them,\nbut he doesn’t know where they are.
A3_3030_TIM_100_3000	Yeah, these ruins are pretty big.
A3_3030_GHIHIDARUMA_100_7000	Darman!
A3_3030_PIKACHU_100_12000	OK, OK, I heard you. If that’s all you want from us,\nI’m sure we can help you out!
A3_3030_GHIHIDARUMA_100_8000	Dar!
A3_3030_PIKACHU_100_13000	Yep, you’ve got yourself a deal, Darmanitan!
A3_3050_PIKACHU_100_1000	Heh heh! What a great view!
A3_3050_PIKACHU_100_2000	A little cold, though...
A3_3050_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Just let me know what you want smashed!)
A3_3050_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(I can take out a boulder or a block of ice with just\none punch!)
A3_3050_PIKACHU_100_3000	You’re pretty confident in your strength, aren’t ya?
A3_3050_PIKACHU_100_4000	OK then, let’s see what you’ve got, Darmanitan!
A3_3110_RACHEL_100_1000	Professor Gordon! Are you OK?!
A3_3110_GORDON_100_1000	Oh, Rachel! And you are...?
A3_3110_TIM_100_1000	My name’s Tim. I’m also a student at Ryme University.
A3_3110_RACHEL_100_2000	We heard you hadn’t been back for two days, so we\ncame in here to check on you.
A3_3110_GORDON_100_2000	Oh, you must have heard from Chris...
A3_3110_GORDON_100_3000	I’m sorry I worried you. But thanks to you, I’m safe!
A3_3110_GORDON_100_4000	Although I’ll admit I thought I was done for when that\nDarmanitan came into the room.
A3_3110_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar.
A3_3110_TIM_100_2000	Don’t worry about Darmanitan. Pikachu’s already\nbefriended him.
A3_3110_GORDON_100_5000	Oh, I see. So the Pikachu I saw before was\nyour partner.
A3_3110_GORDON_100_6000	Sorry I didn’t realize that, Pikachu.
A3_3110_PIKACHU_100_1000	Nah, it’s fine.
A3_3110_RACHEL_100_3000	Professor! Are you OK?
A3_3110_GORDON_100_7000	Hah! No need to worry about me.
A3_3110_TIM_100_3000	You say that like you haven’t been trapped in this\ncold for two whole days!
A3_3110_GORDON_100_8000	I’ve been all over the world for my fieldwork.
A3_3110_GORDON_100_9000	What can I say? I’m a tough guy.
A3_3110_PIKACHU_100_2000	You’re tellin’ me!
A3_3110_TIM_100_4000	Is it all right if we ask you a few questions? I want to\nfigure out exactly how this all happened.
A3_3110_GORDON_100_10000	Yes, of course.
A3_3120_RACHEL_100_1000	I’m so relieved to see the professor’s OK.
A3_3125_YADON_100_1000	Slow!
A3_3125_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’re happy Mr. Go’s all right?
A3_3125_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’m pretty sure Gordon was worried about you too.
A3_3130_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Darman?
A3_3130_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’re just gonna clear some things up. Can you wait\na bit?
A3_3140_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey! Where are you going, Tim? Let’s hear what\nGordon has to say!
A3_3150_GORDON_100_1000	So, where do you want me to start?
A3_3150_SEL_0_1000	What happened?
A3_3150_SEL_0_2000	Why did Darmanitan chase you?
A3_3150_SEL_0_3000	About the ruins...
A3_3150_GORDON_300_1000	When I reached this floor, a Darmanitan was also\nhere for some reason.
A3_3150_GORDON_300_2000	The moment that Darmanitan saw me, it suddenly\nstarted chasing after me!
A3_3150_GORDON_300_3000	I tried to run out of the ruins, but before I knew it, the\ndoor had already closed behind me.
A3_3150_GORDON_300_4000	With nowhere else to go, I ran into this room.
A3_3150_TIM_400_1000	Why do you suppose Darmanitan chased after you?
A3_3150_GORDON_400_1000	At first, I thought it wanted the food I had on me.
A3_3150_GORDON_400_2000	But it’s possible there’s another reason.
A3_3150_TIM_400_2000	What do you mean?
A3_3150_GORDON_400_3000	Well, it hasn’t left this place in two days. If it was\nhungry before, it’s gotta be starving by now.
A3_3150_GORDON_400_4000	Looking back, I think Darmanitan might’ve been\ntrying to prevent me from going deeper into the\nruins.
A3_3150_GORDON_400_5000	It seems really interested in something back there.
A3_3150_PIKACHU_400_1000	Hmm... Darmanitan didn’t mention anything about\nsomething deeper in the ruins.
A3_3150_TIM_500_1000	Why were you here in the ruins in the first place,\nProfessor?
A3_3150_GORDON_500_1000	An interesting discovery was made recently regarding\nthe geological strata of this area.
A3_3150_GORDON_500_2000	It seems a large number of meteorites once fell\naround these parts a long time ago.
A3_3150_TIM_500_2000	Meteorites, huh?
A3_3150_GORDON_500_3000	Yes, and it occurred around the same time that these\nruins were built.
A3_3150_GORDON_500_4000	That’s why I wanted to come here and do some\nfield research.
A3_3150_RACHEL_500_1000	Is there some connection between the meteorites and\nthe ruins?
A3_3150_GORDON_500_5000	It’s too soon for me to say. I was hoping to figure that\nout with this survey.
A3_3150_GORDON_500_6000	I did learn a few things during my research, though.
A3_3150_GORDON_500_7000	The people who built these ruins had a deep\nconnection with Aegislash.
A3_3150_TIM_500_3000	Oh yeah. We did see a relief of Aegislash.
A3_3150_GORDON_500_8000	Aegislash’s shield defends against misfortune.
A3_3150_GORDON_500_9000	And its sword is a symbol of slashing that\nmisfortune away.
A3_3150_GORDON_500_10000	I believe this represents the people’s hope for\npeaceful, protected lives.
A3_3150_GORDON_500_11000	And at these ruins, those people held a very\nimportant ritual.
A3_3150_TIM_500_4000	Really? What kind of ritual?
A3_3150_GORDON_500_12000	A ritual to strengthen the bonds between people\nand Pokémon.
A3_3150_GORDON_500_13000	By working together and helping each other, people\nand Pokémon could overcome all sorts of trouble.
A3_3150_GORDON_500_14000	So it’s said that this ritual was meant to teach that\nway of thinking.
A3_3150_RACHEL_500_2000	That’s a wonderful attitude.
A3_3150_GORDON_500_15000	I agree. I believe that coexistence between Pokémon\nand humans is the overarching theme of these ruins.
A3_3150_GORDON_500_16000	Our history has always been intertwined with that of\nPokémon.
A3_3150_GORDON_500_17000	I think our modern society could benefit from thinking\nmore like these people did.
A3_3160_GORDON_100_1000	Sorry, I know I tend to ramble.
A3_3160_TIM_100_1000	No, I appreciate it. Now I’ve got a better\nunderstanding of the situation.
A3_3160_GORDON_100_2000	By the way, what made you all come way out here?
A3_3160_TIM_100_2000	Actually, there was something we wanted to ask you\nabout, Professor.
A3_3160_GORDON_100_3000	Oh? What would that be?
A3_3160_TIM_100_3000	A precious jewel was recently stolen in Ryme City.
A3_3160_TIM_100_4000	We were wondering if you could tell us what exactly\nthat jewel is.
A3_3160_GORDON_100_4000	Sure, I’ll help you if I can.
A3_3160_TIM_100_5000	Thank you! Here’s a photo of the jewel.
A3_3180_TIM_100_1000	You’re saying this jewel is actually a Pokémon?
A3_3180_GORDON_100_1000	I am. In fact, according to one hypothesis, this crystal\nmay have fallen from space just like a meteorite.
A3_3180_GORDON_100_2000	Some say the crystal will assume its true shape if it’s\nimbued with a special energy.
A3_3180_GORDON_100_3000	I’ve never seen it in that state myself, though...
A3_3180_PIKACHU_100_1000	It never even occurred to me that the Aurora Drop\nmight be a Pokémon.
A3_3180_PIKACHU_100_1500	I wonder if the thief knew that when they stole it.
A3_3180_PIKACHU_100_2000	And if so, what did they want it for?
A3_3180_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hmmm... The questions just keep piling up.
A3_3180_GORDON_100_4000	Is that all you wanted to ask me about, Tim?
A3_3180_TIM_100_3000	Yes. Thanks so much for your help!
A3_3180_RACHEL_100_1000	Well then, Professor. We should get back to Chris.
A3_3180_GORDON_100_5000	No, I’ll let you tell Chris that I’m all right.
A3_3180_GORDON_100_6000	I’m so close to unlocking the secrets of these ruins.
A3_3180_GORDON_100_7000	Since I’ve already made it this far, I’d like to finish\nbefore I head back.
A3_3180_TIM_100_4000	You can’t be serious! Are you sure you’re all right?!
A3_3180_GORDON_100_8000	I told you, this is really nothing.
A3_3180_GORDON_100_9000	Thanks to you all, I can freely explore the ruins now!
A3_3180_GORDON_100_10000	I don’t want to waste another minute.
A3_3180_PIKACHU_100_4000	Oh, come on! I heard he was passionate about his\nresearch, but this is ridiculous!
A3_3180_RACHEL_100_2000	Wow, he’s really determined to stay.
A3_3180_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar dar.
A3_3180_PIKACHU_100_5000	Oh, you really want to start searching for your\nfriends, huh?
A3_3180_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Darman.
A3_3180_PIKACHU_100_6000	Well, I suppose now’s as good a time as ever.
A3_3180_PIKACHU_100_7000	Tim, why don’t you and Rachel stay here for a bit and\nkeep an eye on Gordon?
A3_3180_PIKACHU_100_8000	In the meantime, I’ll go and keep my promise\nto Darmanitan.
A3_3180_TIM_100_5000	OK. We can’t just leave the professor here, after all.
A3_3180_PIKACHU_100_9000	Right, then it’s settled.
A3_3180_PIKACHU_100_10000	OK, let’s go, Darmanitan!
A3_3180_GHIHIDARUMA_100_3000	Dar dar!
A3_3210_GORDON_100_1000	I see. So that rumble really was the door closing.
A3_3210_TIM_100_1000	Did you suspect that already, Professor?
A3_3210_GORDON_100_2000	Yes, because the same thing happened when I came\ndown to this floor.
A3_3210_GORDON_100_3000	There was suddenly a deep rumbling sound, and then\nI was trapped down here on this floor.
A3_3210_PIKACHU_100_1000	That must’ve been one of the two rumbling sounds\nSlowpoke said he heard.
A3_3210_TIM_100_2000	Isn’t there another exit?
A3_3210_GORDON_100_4000	I believe so, yes.
A3_3210_RACHEL_100_1000	Do you know where?
A3_3210_GORDON_100_5000	There may be one in the deepest room of the ruins.
A3_3210_GORDON_100_6000	It’s said that these ruins were originally built to host\na ritual that strengthens the bonds between people\nand Pokémon.
A3_3210_GORDON_100_7000	There’s an ancient document describing the ritual,\nand I found one line particularly interesting:
A3_3210_GORDON_100_8000	“Solve all the riddles in the deepest place,\nand find yourself back in the sun’s embrace.”
A3_3210_PIKACHU_100_2000	“The sun’s embrace” must be a reference to\nthe outside.
A3_3210_TIM_100_3000	I see.
A3_3210_TIM_100_4000	So if we solve all the riddles of the ruins, we might be\nable to find an exit and get out of here!
A3_3210_GORDON_100_9000	Yes, if that document is to be believed.
A3_3210_TIM_100_5000	I wonder what kind of riddles it’s referencing.
A3_3210_GORDON_100_10000	I’m not sure, but...I’m curious about the two murals\non this floor.
A3_3210_GORDON_100_11000	I can’t say for certain that they’re related to the \nriddles or the ritual, but they must have some meaning\nor other.
A3_3210_GORDON_100_11500	There’s the mural in this room and one in the other\nroom. Why don’t you take a good look at them both?
A3_3210_TIM_100_6000	Thanks, Professor.
A3_3210_TIM_100_7000	We’ll investigate them right away.
A3_3210_GORDON_100_12000	Thank you. I’ll stay here and ponder these riddles\na bit more.
A3_3210_GORDON_100_13000	If you find anything, come let me know.
A3_3210_TIM_100_8000	Of course.
A3_3220_RACHEL_100_1000	Who’d have guessed that we’d get stuck in here too?
A3_3220_TIM_100_1000	I’m so sorry we put you in danger like this, Rachel.
A3_3220_RACHEL_100_2000	Why are you apologizing? Coming here was\nmy decision.
A3_3220_RACHEL_100_3000	Besides, I know you two will find the exit!
A3_3220_TIM_100_2000	We’ll certainly try.
A3_3220_PIKACHU_100_1000	This is your chance to show her what you’ve got, Tim!
A3_3220_TIM_100_3000	Really, Pikachu? This again?
A3_3220_RACHEL_200_1000	I know you two will find the exit.
A3_3230_GORDON_100_1000	If we can figure out the secret of the ruins, we\nshould be able to find an exit.
A3_3230_GORDON_100_2000	You’ve made it this far—I’m sure you can do this too!
A3_3230_GORDON_100_3000	I’m counting on that great detective work I’ve heard\nso much about.
A3_3230_TIM_100_1000	Right. I’ll do my best.
A3_3230_PIKACHU_100_1000	Don’t forget you’ve got me with you! I’m sure we can\nfind something as simple as an exit.
A3_3230_GORDON_200_1000	I’m counting on you, Tim.
A3_3240_YADON_100_1000	Slow slow.
A3_3240_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’re worried because you wanted to hurry and get\nMr. Go home, but now we’re all stuck?
A3_3240_PIKACHU_100_2000	Don’t worry—we’ll figure something out.
A3_3240_TIM_100_1000	His face may not show it, but Slowpoke is\npretty concerned, huh?
A3_3240_YADON_200_1000	Slowpoke...
A3_3240_PIKACHU_200_1000	Don’t worry. We’ll get him out of here safely.
A3_3250_TIM_100_1000	Do you know if there are any other\nexits, Darmanitan?
A3_3250_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar... Daaar...
A3_3250_PIKACHU_100_1000	He seems to be thinking really hard.
A3_3250_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Dar... Daaar...
A3_3250_PIKACHU_200_1000	He seems to be thinking really hard.
A3_3260_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a mural depicting a human.
A3_3260_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s see if it can give us any clues about the exit.
A3_3270_PIKACHU_100_1000	I bet we can find some important hints here.\nLet’s examine this closely.
A3_3280_PIKACHU_5000_1000	Don’t you think we oughta look around here a\nlittle more?
A3_3290_PIKACHU_100_1000	Ow...
A3_3290_PIKACHU_100_2000	My tail really hurts for some reason...
A3_3290_PIKACHU_100_3000	I can’t imagine why... Right, Tim?
A3_3300_TIM_100_1000	This looks like a drawing of a human.
A3_3300_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. The style is similar to the relief we saw on the\nentrance too.
A3_3300_TIM_100_2000	<color=#F39800FF>It looks like there’s a pedestal or something under its\nfeet. Maybe it’s depicting a statue of a human?</color>
A3_3300_PIKACHU_100_2000	The Passimian murals all corresponded to\nspecific statues...
A3_3300_PIKACHU_100_3000	So maybe there’s a human statue somewhere too?
A3_3300_TIM_100_3000	We saw some reliefs of a human carved into a wall,\nbut I don’t remember seeing any statues.
A3_3310_PIKACHU_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>These look like footprints.</color>
A3_3310_PIKACHU_300_1000	The way these footprints are arranged reminds me of\nthe Pokémon mural we just saw...
A3_3310_TIM_300_1000	They’re taking a weird path too. Do you think that\nmeans something?
A3_3310_TIM_400_1000	Based on the direction they’re pointing, it looks like\nthey’re walking away from the human.
A3_3310_PIKACHU_400_1000	But they’re zigzagging everywhere...
A3_3310_PIKACHU_400_2000	Think there’s some meaning to that weird path?
A3_3320_TIM_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>I wonder if the door drawn here is supposed to be\nthe exit out of the ruins.</color>
A3_3320_PIKACHU_300_1000	Seems like a safe assumption. The Pokémon mural\ndepicted the same thing.
A3_3320_PIKACHU_300_2000	If that’s the exit, we should be able to get out\nthrough there if we solve the last puzzle.
A3_3320_PIKACHU_400_1000	Seems that way.
A3_3320_PIKACHU_400_2000	But we haven’t been anywhere that looks like this.
A3_3320_PIKACHU_400_3000	Where could the exit be, then...?
A3_3340_TIM_100_1000	I think that’s all there is to see here.
A3_3360_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a mural depicting a Pokémon.
A3_3360_PIKACHU_100_2000	This might be a clue about the exit. Let’s check it out!
A3_3370_PIKACHU_100_1000	Now think really hard as you examine this.
A3_3380_PIKACHU_5000_1000	Don’t you think we oughta look around here a\nlittle more?
A3_3390_TIM_100_1000	It’s an image of a Pokémon. Is this meant to be\nClefairy?
A3_3390_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, there were those reliefs of Clefairy carved into\nthe entrance.
A3_3390_PIKACHU_100_2000	But this mural... What’s that shape under Clefairy’s\nfeet?
A3_3390_TIM_100_2000	<color=#F39800FF>It looks like some sort of pedestal. Maybe it’s\ndepicting a statue of Clefairy?</color>
A3_3390_PIKACHU_100_3000	The Passimian murals were representing statues,\nso maybe this one is too.
A3_3390_PIKACHU_100_4000	If that’s the case, though, there should be an actual\nstatue somewhere.
A3_3390_TIM_100_3000	Maybe we just haven’t found it yet.
A3_3400_TIM_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>Are these Pokémon footprints?</color>
A3_3400_PIKACHU_300_1000	I think we can be pretty sure of that.
A3_3400_PIKACHU_300_2000	They remind me of the ones in the mural of the\nhuman we saw earlier.
A3_3400_TIM_300_1000	They’re taking a weird path. Do you think that\nmeans something?
A3_3400_PIKACHU_400_1000	Seems like a safe assumption.
A3_3400_PIKACHU_400_2000	Based on the direction they’re pointing, it looks like\nthey’re walking away from the Pokémon.
A3_3400_TIM_400_1000	They’re taking a weird path. Do you think that\nmeans something?
A3_3410_PIKACHU_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>Do you think this drawing represents a door?</color>
A3_3410_TIM_300_1000	There was a drawing just like this on the mural with\nthe human too.
A3_3410_PIKACHU_300_1000	If that’s the exit, we should be able to get out\nthrough there if we solve the last puzzle.
A3_3410_TIM_400_1000	If so, it might be telling us that solving this puzzle will\nopen the exit for us.
A3_3410_TIM_400_2000	Or maybe it’s just showing us WHERE the exit is.
A3_3410_PIKACHU_400_1000	At this point, I think either explanation is possible.
A3_3430_TIM_100_1000	I think that’s all there is to see here.
A3_3445_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s no way we can open this door on our own.
A3_3445_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s look for another exit.
A3_3450_GORDON_100_1000	I see. So you’ve figured out what the murals mean,\nbut you still don’t know where the exit is...
A3_3450_TIM_100_1000	Right—and we’ve already looked through every room\ndown here.
A3_3450_TIM_100_2000	I’m not sure where else we can look.
A3_3450_GORDON_100_2000	The old document said that the exit was in the\ndeepest room, but...
A3_3450_PIKACHU_100_2000	The deepest, huh?
A3_3450_PIKACHU_100_3000	Wait a second... Have we really searched all\nthe rooms?
A3_3450_PIKACHU_100_4000	Hmm... I can’t be sure until we look around\na bit more.
A3_3450_PIKACHU_100_5000	Why don’t we try looking at the deepest room in the\nruins one more time, Tim?
A3_3450_TIM_100_4000	This is the room we were in when you went to go\ncheck on the professor, right?
A3_3450_PIKACHU_100_6000	This room is the farthest back from the entrance to\nthe ruins, which makes it the “deepest,” I think. We\nshould probably look around here again.
A3_3450_PIKACHU_100_7000	We saw that hole into the next room before,\nbut we might find something else.
A3_3450_TIM_100_5000	OK. Let’s give it another once-over.
A3_3450_PIKACHU_100_8000	Thanks, Tim.
A3_3450_PIKACHU_100_9000	Can’t say I know exactly what we’re looking for,\nbut let’s pay close attention to the walls and floor.
A3_3455_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Tim. I think the room we’re in now is the\n“deepest” one in the ruins.
A3_3455_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s be extra thorough searching it.
A3_3460_TIM_100_1000	There’s a wall of ice here. Doesn’t look like there’s\nanother room in this direction.
A3_3460_TIM_100_2000	It really is a big hunk of ice, though. Do you think\nMr. Mime and Bergmite made it?
A3_3460_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wait, maybe this wall is...
A3_3460_TIM_100_3000	What is it, Pikachu?
A3_3460_PIKACHU_100_4000	Hold on, I feel like I’m on the brink of an epiphany.
A3_3480_TIM_100_1000	If the mechanism’s on the other side of this ice wall...
A3_3480_TIM_100_2000	then what we thought was a real wall is just a thick\nslab of ice?!
A3_3480_PIKACHU_100_1000	This is the only wall that’s completely frozen over.\nDon’t you find that odd?
A3_3480_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’m sure this wall is the same as the one in Mr. Mime’s\nroom.
A3_3480_GORDON_100_1000	So this is nothing but ice? It sure looks like a wall\nto me.
A3_3480_TIM_100_3000	I mean, we don’t have any proof yet, but—
A3_3480_PIKACHU_100_3000	There’s one way to find out!
A3_3480_PIKACHU_100_4000	Go ahead and do what you do best, Darmanitan!
A3_3480_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	... ... ...
A3_3480_PIKACHU_100_5000	What’s wrong? We really need your strength\nright now!
A3_3480_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	... ... ...
A3_3480_TIM_100_4000	Pikachu seems to be asking him to break down the\nwall of ice...
A3_3480_TIM_100_4500	but Darmanitan’s not even trying to do it...
A3_3480_RACHEL_100_1000	Maybe he doesn’t want to break this ice?
A3_3480_GHIHIDARUMA_100_3000	Darman...
A3_3480_PIKACHU_100_7000	Apparently there’s someone in there, and he’s not\nsure it’s a good idea to let us in.
A3_3480_TIM_100_5000	Seems like Darmanitan is still wary of us humans...
A3_3480_RACHEL_100_2000	Darmanitan, please listen! I know you can’t\nunderstand what I’m saying...
A3_3480_RACHEL_100_3000	But we don’t mean you or your friends any harm!
A3_3480_GHIHIDARUMA_100_4000	Dar...
A3_3480_GORDON_100_2000	If we make it out of here, I’ll make it my personal\nmission to help you.
A3_3480_GORDON_100_3000	I’ll take care of you and all your friends! I swear!
A3_3480_GORDON_100_4000	Tim, do you think your Pikachu could put in a good\nword for us?
A3_3480_PIKACHU_100_8000	Please, Darmanitan. We’re all friends here.
A3_3480_GHIHIDARUMA_100_5000	...Dar!
A3_3480_TIM_100_6000	Sounds like he’s on board!
A3_3480_RACHEL_100_4000	So he really did understand our feelings?!
A3_3480_GHIHIDARUMA_100_6000	Darmaaan!
A3_3610_GORDON_100_1000	Wow, so there was a room here after all!
A3_3610_PIKACHU_100_1000	Just like I said!
A3_3610_TIM_100_1000	Pretty impressive, Pikachu.
A3_3610_TIM_100_2000	There should be a mechanism in this room that we\ncan activate...
A3_3640_TIM_100_1000	That shaking felt just like when the door\nclosed before!
A3_3640_TIM_100_2000	Eiscue caused that somehow, right?
A3_3640_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, it stepped on some kinda switch on the floor.
A3_3640_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar dar.
A3_3640_PIKACHU_100_2000	He’s saying that Eiscue didn’t mean to shut us\nin here...
A3_3640_PIKACHU_100_3000	So we shouldn’t blame her.
A3_3640_PIKACHU_100_4000	Don’t worry—we’re not blaming her for anything.
A3_3640_TIM_100_3000	Was Darmanitan hesitant to break the wall because\nof Eiscue?
A3_3640_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Daaar dar...
A3_3640_PIKACHU_100_5000	He says Eiscue’s even more afraid of humans than the\nrest of the ice Pokémon are.
A3_3640_PIKACHU_100_6000	That’s why he built a huge wall of ice, so no one\nelse could get in this room.
A3_3640_TIM_100_4000	It might be good to hear Eiscue’s story, too.
A3_3640_TIM_100_5000	I just hope we can convince her to trust us.
A3_3640_PIKACHU_100_7000	We can try talking to her while we’re solving the\nmystery of the mechanism.
A3_3645_PIKACHU_100_1000	Tim, I’m sure the exit is in this room.
A3_3645_PIKACHU_100_2000	There’s no more need to go back there.
A3_3650_RACHEL_100_1000	Darmanitan was worried about Eiscue, huh?
A3_3650_RACHEL_100_2000	I guess he was just trying to protect his friend.
A3_3660_GORDON_100_1000	So, this is the last room.
A3_3660_GORDON_100_2000	I hope we can find the exit without much trouble...
A3_3670_YADON_100_1000	Slow...
A3_3670_TIM_100_1000	What is it, Slowpoke?
A3_3670_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s been working so hard to rescue Gordon. I think\nhe’s just about out of steam.
A3_3670_TIM_100_2000	Hang in there just a little bit longer, Slowpoke.
A3_3680_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar daaar!
A3_3680_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, you all got in here through the hole in this\nroom’s ceiling?
A3_3680_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Darman.
A3_3680_PIKACHU_100_2000	And you’re sorry you didn’t tell us about this room,\neven though you knew about it.
A3_3680_PIKACHU_100_3000	Don’t worry about it, Darmanitan. We know you were\njust looking out for your friend.
A3_3690_KORIPPOI_100_1000	Eis...
A3_3690_PIKACHU_100_1000	You don’t need to be scared, Eiscue. We’re friends\nof Darmanitan.
A3_3690_KORIPPOI_100_2000	Cue?
A3_3690_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yes, really. So could you please trust us?
A3_3690_KORIPPOI_100_3000	Cue...
A3_3690_PIKACHU_100_3000	It’s OK if it’s just a few questions, eh?
A3_3690_KORIPPOI_200_1000	Eiscue?
A3_3690_SEL_0_1000	About you, Eiscue...
A3_3690_SEL_0_2000	About Darmanitan...
A3_3690_SEL_0_3000	About the people dressed in white...
A3_3690_PIKACHU_300_1000	Have you been in this room the whole time?
A3_3690_KORIPPOI_300_1000	Eiscue.
A3_3690_PIKACHU_300_2000	Oh, OK. You all came in through the hole in\nthe ceiling.
A3_3690_KORIPPOI_300_2000	Cue cue.
A3_3690_PIKACHU_300_3000	And then all the others left the room, but you stayed\nhere because you were too scared?
A3_3690_PIKACHU_300_4000	So you got Darmanitan to make you a big wall of\nice to keep you safe inside.
A3_3690_TIM_300_1000	She must have been really terrified...
A3_3690_PIKACHU_300_5000	You don’t need to be scared anymore, Eiscue.
A3_3690_PIKACHU_300_6000	We’re here to rescue you!
A3_3690_KORIPPOI_300_3000	Cue?!
A3_3690_PIKACHU_300_7000	Yeah, really!
A3_3690_TIM_300_2000	So cheer up, Eiscue. We’ve got your back.
A3_3690_KORIPPOI_300_4000	Eis!
A3_3690_PIKACHU_300_8000	Aww, looks like she’s smiling a little.
A3_3690_TIM_300_3000	Really? I, uh...can’t really tell from her face.
A3_3690_PIKACHU_400_1000	So Darmanitan’s been protecting you this\nwhole time.
A3_3690_KORIPPOI_400_1000	Eis...
A3_3690_PIKACHU_400_2000	And he made sure to stay nearby, too, to make\nyou feel safe?
A3_3690_KORIPPOI_400_2000	Eis eis...
A3_3690_PIKACHU_400_3000	And it’s thanks to Darmanitan that you were able to\nescape from the people in white...
A3_3690_PIKACHU_400_4000	I can see why you’re intent on repaying him someday.
A3_3690_PIKACHU_400_5000	But you know he doesn’t expect anything in return,\nright? That’s not why he did it.
A3_3690_PIKACHU_400_6000	Don’t do anything too rash.
A3_3690_KORIPPOI_400_3000	Eis...
A3_3690_PIKACHU_500_1000	Where are the humans who captured you all?
A3_3690_KORIPPOI_500_1000	Eis eis...
A3_3690_PIKACHU_500_2000	Really far away, huh?
A3_3690_PIKACHU_500_3000	You walked for days before you found this place?
A3_3690_KORIPPOI_500_2000	Eeeis...
A3_3690_PIKACHU_500_4000	Just the thought that those humans might come here\nreally scares you?
A3_3690_PIKACHU_500_5000	Don’t worry. If they show up here, we’ll send\n’em packing.
A3_3690_KORIPPOI_500_3000	Eis!
A3_3700_TIM_100_1000	This is the tree that Eiscue was up in.
A3_3700_TIM_100_2000	It’s pretty amazing that a tree this big could grow in\nan underground room like this.
A3_3700_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, look—there’s light coming in where the\nroof collapsed.
A3_3700_PIKACHU_100_2000	That light must be what helped the tree grow so big.
A3_3700_TIM_200_1000	It’s pretty amazing that a tree this big could grow in\nan underground room like this.
A3_3710_TIM_100_1000	It’s the Clefairy statue!
A3_3710_PIKACHU_100_1000	Just like in the mural. This is definitely the right\nroom, then.
A3_3710_PIKACHU_100_2000	Now we just have to move this statue exactly how\nthe mural showed.
A3_3710_TIM_100_2000	There should be a human statue too. Where do you\nthink that is?
A3_3710_PIKACHU_100_3000	It’s gotta be in this room somewhere.\nLet’s look around.
A3_3710_TIM_200_1000	If we move this statue, the exit out of these ruins\nshould open.
A3_3710_PIKACHU_200_1000	There should be another statue too. Let’s look for it.
A3_3720_TIM_100_1000	There’s a big hunk of ice here.
A3_3720_PIKACHU_100_1000	Eiscue probably made it.
A3_3720_PIKACHU_100_2000	It really is big, though. I’m surprised she could make\nsomething of this scale.
A3_3720_TIM_200_1000	It sure is a big hunk of ice.
A3_3730_TIM_100_1000	This must be the exit out of the ruins.
A3_3730_PIKACHU_100_1000	Nnngh!
A3_3730_PIKACHU_100_2000	It’s no good. This thing’s not gonna open unless we\nfigure out that mechanism.
A3_3730_PIKACHU_200_1000	We need to solve the puzzle if we want this door\nto open.
A3_3740_TIM_100_1000	We’ve looked all over the room, but I didn’t see a\nstatue of a human anywhere.
A3_3740_PIKACHU_100_1000	There has to be one, though...
A3_3740_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s talk to Gordon again.
A3_3740_TIM_100_2000	Good idea.
A3_3750_TIM_100_1000	Hey, Professor. We can’t find one of the statues\ndepicted in the murals.
A3_3750_TIM_100_2000	Do you have any idea where it might be?
A3_3750_GORDON_100_1000	Unfortunately, I don’t.
A3_3750_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hmm... Even Gordon’s stumped.
A3_3750_GORDON_100_2000	Many aspects of this place differ from what I\nexpected based on my preparatory research—\nlike that wall of ice, for example.
A3_3750_GORDON_100_3000	Why don’t we try talking this through, Tim?
A3_3750_GORDON_200_1000	Is now a good time?
A3_3750_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_3750_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_3750_TIM_300_1000	Yeah, I’m good. What exactly did you want to\ntalk about?
A3_3750_GORDON_300_1000	For starters, I want to ask for your help.
A3_3750_TIM_400_1000	Let me explore this room a bit more, and then we\ncan talk.
A3_3750_GORDON_400_1000	All right. Let me know when you’re finished.
A3_3800_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, we managed to get out after all.
A3_3800_TIM_100_1000	Yeah—but who was that man just now?
A3_3800_TIM_100_2000	Do you think he was one of the people in white that\nDarmanitan was talking about?
A3_3800_PIKACHU_100_2000	Sure seems that way to me.
A3_3800_TIM_100_3000	He must have come looking for Darmanitan and\nthe others.
A3_3800_PIKACHU_100_3000	Right, but what FOR?
A3_3800_PIKACHU_100_4000	First the Aurora Drop, and now this...\nFeels like we’re caught in the middle of a bunch of\nstuff we don’t understand!
A3_3800_TIM_100_4000	What should Darmanitan and his friends do now?
A3_3800_GORDON_100_1000	I’ll make sure they’re OK.
A3_3800_RACHEL_100_1000	Thank you so much, Professor!
A3_3800_GORDON_100_2000	Yes, well, I’ve got to set a good example for\nmy students, you know!
A3_3800_TIM_100_5000	If the professor takes all the ice Pokémon home, the\nruins should return to normal soon too.
A3_3800_PIKACHU_100_5000	Yeah, and Monferno’ll be able to come back!
A3_3800_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Dar!
A3_3800_GORDON_100_3000	Now then, you should get home. That man from\nbefore is still around here somewhere.
A3_3800_GORDON_100_4000	And for all we know, he has friends around too.
A3_3800_TIM_100_6000	You’re right.
A3_3800_TIM_100_7000	Thanks for all your help, Professor Gordon.
A3_3800_GORDON_100_5000	Hey, you’re the one that saved me!
A3_3800_GORDON_100_6000	You’re certainly an interesting student.
A3_3800_GORDON_100_7000	My office door will always be open to you—so please,\nstop by some time.
A3_3800_RACHEL_100_2000	We’ll be right here, Tim, so just say the word when\nyou’re ready to go home.
A3_3910_RACHEL_100_1000	Are you ready to go home, Tim?
A3_3910_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_3910_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_3910_TIM_300_1000	Yeah, let’s go.
A3_3910_RACHEL_300_1000	You know, today was really fun.
A3_3910_TIM_300_2000	Really? It was touch-and-go there for a bit.
A3_3910_RACHEL_300_2000	I know, right?! It was so exciting!
A3_3910_RACHEL_300_3000	Plus, I got to learn about what kinds of things you’re\nusually up to.
A3_3910_RACHEL_300_4000	You better hit me up for your next case, too!
A3_3910_TIM_300_3000	Haha, I’m not sure about that...
A3_3910_RACHEL_300_5000	Don’t worry, I’m just messing around. I know I’d just\nbe a bother if I tagged along every time.
A3_3910_RACHEL_300_6000	Anyway, let’s go home.
A3_3910_TIM_400_1000	I need a bit more time to look around the ruins.
A3_3910_RACHEL_400_1000	OK. Let me know when you’re ready, then.
A3_3910_RACHEL_400_2000	And don’t leave without me!
A3_3920_GORDON_100_1000	Darmanitan and his friends aren’t from this place.
A3_3920_GORDON_100_2000	They must have been brought here by humans.
A3_3920_GORDON_100_3000	I give you my word that I’ll return these Pokémon\nto their proper home.
A3_3930_YADON_100_1000	Slowww...
A3_3930_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’re hungry now that we’ve escaped, huh?
A3_3930_YADON_100_2000	Slow slow.
A3_3930_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh, I see. You want some of Chris’s curry.
A3_3930_TIM_100_1000	Everyone seems to really love his curry!
A3_3940_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar?
A3_3940_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hm? Do I want a ride?
A3_3940_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_3940_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_3940_PIKACHU_300_1000	Sure, if you’re offering to help us out a little more.
A3_3940_GHIHIDARUMA_300_1000	Dar!
A3_3940_PIKACHU_400_1000	Nah, I’m fine right now. Thanks though!
A3_3945_TIM_100_1000	Oh, Eiscue’s ice is back to normal!
A3_3945_PIKACHU_100_1000	Eiscue’s face is pretty sensitive to heat.\nI bet she wants to keep it nice and cold.
A3_3945_KORIPPOI_100_1000	Cue!
A3_3945_PIKACHU_100_2000	You’re thanking us for before?
A3_3945_PIKACHU_100_3000	Nah, you were the one who saved us!
A3_3945_PIKACHU_100_4000	I’m sure Darmanitan’s really happy about that too.
A3_3950_JOSHUA_100_1000	I’m so glad you found the professor and brought him\nback safe and sound. Thank you so much, Tim.
A3_3950_JOSHUA_100_2000	Please come visit us at the university sometime!
A3_3950_JOSHUA_100_3000	We’ll be sure to prepare a big thank-you!
A3_3960_GONBE_100_1000	Munch!
A3_3960_PIKACHU_100_1000	You need a bigger pot since you’ve made so many\nnew friends?
A3_3960_GONBE_100_2000	Lax lax!
A3_3960_PIKACHU_100_2000	He says he’s gonna eat curry with all the others to\nbecome better friends.
A3_3960_TIM_100_1000	That sounds like a Munchlax plan all right.
A3_3970_NAGETUKESARU_100_1000	Pass!
A3_3970_PIKACHU_100_1000	Sorry about all the fuss we caused.
A3_3970_NAGETUKESARU_100_2000	Pass?
A3_3970_PIKACHU_100_2000	You want to know if this cold is going away?
A3_3970_PIKACHU_100_3000	I think this place’ll be back to its usual climate\nreal soon.
A3_3980_HASSBOH01_100_1000	Lo!
A3_3980_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hi there! We’re gettin’ ready to go home now.
A3_3980_HASSBOH02_100_1000	Lo lo! ♪
A3_3980_HASSBOH03_100_1000	Lo lo lo! ♪
A3_3980_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’ll come visit again sometime!
A3_3980_TIM_100_1000	And we’ll bring our music-loving friend too!
A3_40010_PIKACHU_100_1000	Feelin’ stuck, Tim?
A3_40010_PIKACHU_100_2000	Want some advice?
A3_40010_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_40010_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_40010_PIKACHU_300_1000	Y’know how there are lots of trees outside the ruins?
A3_40010_PIKACHU_300_2000	In places like this, you can usually find Pokémon\nliving up in the trees.
A3_40010_PIKACHU_300_3000	So if we inspect the trees closely, we might be able to\nlearn something from those Pokémon.
A3_40010_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Try thinking about it yourself a little more.
A3_40010_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m here to help whenever you need me.
A3_40015_PIKACHU_100_1000	Feelin’ stuck, Tim?
A3_40015_PIKACHU_100_2000	Want some advice?
A3_40015_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_40015_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_40015_PIKACHU_300_1000	Well, we saw two switches with the same design—one\non the ground and one on top of the door.
A3_40015_PIKACHU_300_2000	Don’t you think maybe we oughta press them both?
A3_40015_PIKACHU_300_3000	Gordon and Slowpoke may have gotten through by\npressing both of those switches.
A3_40015_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Try thinking about it yourself a little more.
A3_40015_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m here to help whenever you need me.
A3_40020_PIKACHU_100_1000	Feelin’ stuck, Tim?
A3_40020_PIKACHU_100_2000	Want some advice?
A3_40020_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_40020_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_40020_PIKACHU_300_1000	Y’know how the ruins had that elaborate mechanism\njust to open the entrance?
A3_40020_PIKACHU_300_2000	It wouldn’t be a leap to assume there may be other\nmechanisms like that inside.
A3_40020_PIKACHU_300_3000	Try inspecting the walls and floor. You might find\nsome kind of clue.
A3_40020_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Try thinking about it yourself a little more.
A3_40020_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m here to help whenever you need me.
A3_40030_PIKACHU_100_1000	Feelin’ stuck, Tim?
A3_40030_PIKACHU_100_2000	Want some advice?
A3_40030_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_40030_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_40030_PIKACHU_300_1000	Did you thoroughly investigate the inside of the ruins?\nInvestigation is the basis of detective work, you know.
A3_40030_PIKACHU_300_2000	Once that’s done, you gotta compare your findings.\nLook for any similarities and differences.
A3_40030_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Try thinking about it yourself a little more.
A3_40030_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m here to help whenever you need me.
A3_40040_PIKACHU_100_1000	Feelin’ stuck, Tim?

A3_40040_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_40040_PIKACHU_300_1000	We need to place a sweet, yellow Berry on the statue\nto the left.
A3_40040_PIKACHU_300_2000	Let’s go see if we can find one growin’ on the trees\naround the ruins.
A3_40040_PIKACHU_300_3000	If we have any trouble, we can try asking the\nlocal Pokémon.
A3_40040_PIKACHU_300_4000	They’re bound to know something!
A3_40040_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Try thinking about it yourself a little more.
A3_40040_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m here to help whenever you need me.
A3_40050_PIKACHU_100_1000	Feelin’ stuck, Tim?
A3_40050_PIKACHU_100_2000	Want some advice?

A3_40050_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_40050_PIKACHU_300_1000	We need to place a sour, blue Berry on the statue to\nthe right.
A3_40050_PIKACHU_300_2000	Let’s go see if we can find one growin’ on the trees\naround the ruins.
A3_40050_PIKACHU_300_3000	If we have any trouble, we can try asking the\nlocal Pokémon.
A3_40050_PIKACHU_300_4000	They’re bound to know something!
A3_40050_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Try thinking about it yourself a little more.
A3_40050_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m here to help whenever you need me.
A3_40060_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, I figured it out!
A3_40060_PIKACHU_100_2000	I can help you out if you need a hint.\nWhaddya say?
A3_40060_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_40060_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_40060_PIKACHU_300_1000	The best thing for gettin’ rid of ice has gotta\nbe heat, right?
A3_40060_PIKACHU_300_2000	Was there a Pokémon around here that could\nuse fire?
A3_40060_PIKACHU_300_3000	Look around the ruins carefully!
A3_40060_PIKACHU_400_1000	You wanna think about it on your own some more?\nSounds good.
A3_40060_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m here anytime you wanna talk.
A3_40070_PIKACHU_100_1000	Feelin’ stuck, Tim?
A3_40070_PIKACHU_100_2000	Want some advice?
A3_40070_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_40070_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_40070_PIKACHU_300_1000	We need to place a spicy, red Berry on the statue in\nthe middle.
A3_40070_PIKACHU_300_2000	But we haven’t seen any Berries like that.
A3_40070_PIKACHU_300_3000	If you still can’t find any after lookin’ around, try\ntalking to Chris and the Pokémon around here.
A3_40070_PIKACHU_300_4000	You might learn something from them.
A3_40070_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Try thinking about it yourself a little more.
A3_40070_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m here to help whenever you need me.
A3_40080_PIKACHU_100_1000	Feelin’ stuck, Tim?

A3_40080_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_40080_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_40080_PIKACHU_300_1000	What can we substitute for a Tamato Berry?
A3_40080_PIKACHU_300_2000	If we’re looking for food, I think Chris has some stuff\nhe was using to make curry.
A3_40080_PIKACHU_300_3000	Let’s ask him if he’s got anything the same color and\nflavor as a Tamato Berry.
A3_40080_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Try thinking about it yourself a little more.
A3_40080_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m here to help whenever you need me.
A3_40090_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, I figured it out!
A3_40090_PIKACHU_100_2000	I can help you out if you need a hint.\nWhaddya say?
A3_40090_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_40090_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_40090_PIKACHU_300_1000	If we get in the water in a place this freezing, we’re\nbound to catch a cold.
A3_40090_PIKACHU_300_2000	If only we could make a bridge...
A3_40090_PIKACHU_300_3000	Were there any Pokémon around here who could help\nus with that?
A3_40090_PIKACHU_300_4000	Let’s go look around outside the ruins.
A3_40090_PIKACHU_400_1000	You wanna think about it on your own some more?\nSounds good.
A3_40090_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m here anytime you wanna talk.
A3_40100_PIKACHU_100_1000	Feelin’ stuck, Tim?
A3_40100_PIKACHU_100_2000	Want some advice?
A3_40100_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_40100_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_40100_PIKACHU_300_1000	First we gotta investigate the murals.
A3_40100_PIKACHU_300_2000	We might find a clue, like with the Passimian statues.
A3_40100_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Try thinking about it yourself a little more.
A3_40100_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m here to help whenever you need me.
A3_40105_PIKACHU_100_1000	Feelin’ stuck, Tim?

A3_40105_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A3_40105_SEL_0_2000	No
A3_40105_PIKACHU_300_1000	The footprints in the murals are a big clue.
A3_40105_PIKACHU_300_2000	I don’t think the statues are gonna stand up and start\nwalking themselves...
A3_40105_PIKACHU_300_3000	But we might be able to move the statues around.
A3_40105_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. Try thinking about it yourself a little more.
A3_40105_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m here to help whenever you need me.

A3_4020_TIM_300_1000	Sure, let’s do that.
A3_4020_TIM_300_2000	I’ll go get Rachel.
A3_4020_TIM_400_1000	I want to look around the ruins a bit more.
A3_4020_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK.
A3_40200_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve got everything we need to make our\ndeductions.

A3_4110_VANIPETI_100_1000	Vaniii!
A3_4110_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, I can imagine the lack of snow made this place\npretty uncomfortable for you.
A3_4110_PIKACHU_100_2000	But you were sleeping so soundly when we met you!
A3_4120_MUCHUL_100_1000	Smooooch!
A3_4120_PIKACHU_100_1000	I know you’re happy to be goin’ home, but there’s no\nneed for all those tears!
A3_4130_GBARRIERD_100_1000	Mime mime!
A3_4130_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’re tap dancin’ to show us how happy you are to\nbe headin’ home, huh? I see.
A3_4130_PIKACHU_100_2000	You seem to really love tap dancing, Mr. Mime.
A3_4140_KACHIKOHRU_100_1000	Berrrg!
A3_4140_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’re looking forward to seeing your friends when\nyou get back?
A3_4140_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh, right. Bergmite usually live in herds.
A3_Detective.asset
A3_Q0110_TIM_100_10	What’s the mechanism to get this door open?\nEven after investigating the area, we still can’t\nfigure that out.
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_100_10	Makes sense—we’re not archeology experts, after all.
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_100_20	I think we should use our own methods to solve this.
A3_Q0110_TIM_100_20	What do you mean?
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_100_30	Our detective skills! You know, conducting\ninvestigations, interviewing witnesses, all that jazz.
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_100_40	Chris might know more about the ruins.
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_100_50	And maybe someone saw Gordon open the door.
A3_Q0110_TIM_100_30	But who? Oh, you mean the Pokémon who live here!
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_100_60	Exactly. Let’s go interview witnesses and see if we can\nround up clues.
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_200_10	If we don’t solve this puzzle, the door won’t open.
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_200_20	Let’s conduct some interviews and see if we can get\nany clues.
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_300_10	Did you figure out how to open the door?
A3_Q0110_TIM_400_10	There are two switches with the same design—one\nabove the door and one below the door.
A3_Q0110_TIM_400_20	Maybe the door will open if we press them both.
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_400_10	So you think Gordon climbed the tree to press the\nswitch above the door.
A3_Q0110_TIM_400_30	Yeah, and he had Slowpoke press the one below.
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_400_20	Then maybe all we gotta do is press both switches\nat once!
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_400_30	Let’s try it out!
A3_Q0110_TIM_500_10	Munchlax said the professor was eating something,\nremember?
A3_Q0110_TIM_500_20	Maybe he was trying to build up muscle to get strong\nenough to press down the switch.
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_500_10	You think Gordon might not have been strong enough\nto press the switch?
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_500_20	If that were the case, he could’ve just stood on\nthe switch with a heavy Pokémon like Slowpoke\nto press it.
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_500_30	Besides, humans can’t just eat something and instantly\nbuild muscle. C’mon, Tim.
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_500_40	Think of something else.
A3_Q0110_TIM_600_10	Monferno said it saw a human start a fire, right?
A3_Q0110_TIM_600_20	Maybe the switch is frozen in place and won’t work\nlike it’s supposed to, and the professor was trying to\nmelt the ice.
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_600_10	He was probably just building a fire for the camp site.
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_600_20	Besides, we still got the switch to work in this cold,\ndidn’t we?
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_600_30	There’s gotta be some other way to open the door.
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_800_10	We don’t have any clues yet.
A3_Q0110_PIKACHU_800_20	We’d better investigate more thoroughly.
A3_Q0210_TIM_100_10	The fact that we found the professor’s handkerchief\nhere means he must’ve come to this room.
A3_Q0210_PIKACHU_100_10	Yeah, but I don’t see Gordon anywhere.
A3_Q0210_TIM_100_20	Where do you think he went?
A3_Q0210_PIKACHU_100_20	We might be able to find some more clues about that.
A3_Q0210_PIKACHU_100_30	Let’s investigate this area carefully.
A3_Q0210_PIKACHU_200_10	We haven’t found any useful leads yet, have we?
A3_Q0210_PIKACHU_200_20	Let’s look carefully around the ruins.
A3_Q0210_PIKACHU_300_10	Where could Gordon have gone? Let’s think about\nthis together.
A3_Q0210_TIM_400_10	Maybe this path extends past the relief of Aegislash.
A3_Q0210_TIM_400_20	And the relief could’ve blocked off the path after the\nprofessor had already gone through.
A3_Q0210_TIM_400_30	Does that seem possible to you?
A3_Q0210_PIKACHU_400_10	Hmm... The entrance to the ruins was closed shut,\neven though we know Gordon opened it...
A3_Q0210_PIKACHU_400_20	It’s possible that this relief is also an entrance, and it\nalso closed shut after Gordon walked through it.
A3_Q0210_TIM_400_40	If that’s the case, maybe there’s another mechanism\nthat’ll move this relief.
A3_Q0210_PIKACHU_400_30	Yeah—we’ve just gotta figure out what it is.
A3_Q0210_TIM_500_10	Did you notice how some of the footprints in this\nroom were also heading toward the entrance?
A3_Q0210_TIM_500_20	Maybe the professor just finished his research\nand left.
A3_Q0210_PIKACHU_500_10	If he had, Chris definitely would’ve seen him.
A3_Q0210_PIKACHU_500_20	I’m pretty sure Gordon is still in these ruins.
A3_Q0210_TIM_600_10	We found the professor’s handkerchief on the\nground, right?
A3_Q0210_TIM_600_20	Do you suppose he might have rushed off to use\nthe restroom?
A3_Q0210_PIKACHU_600_10	Umm... And where exactly is this restroom?
A3_Q0210_TIM_600_30	Maybe there’s one deeper in the ruins...?
A3_Q0210_PIKACHU_600_20	Tim... Be serious about this, OK?
A3_Q0210_PIKACHU_800_10	We need to keep investigating and find out where\nGordon went.
A3_Q0210_PIKACHU_800_20	Let’s take a very careful look inside the ruins.
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_100_10	Now we need to investigate and figure out what kind\nof mechanism controls the Aegislash wall.
A3_Q0220_TIM_100_10	How do we do that?
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_100_20	Hmm... There was a unique design on the switches\nthat opened the entrance...
A3_Q0220_TIM_100_20	So that same design might be used inside the\nruins too?
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_100_30	Not necessarily. We have no reason to think that same\ntype of mechanism is being used here.
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_100_40	But that doesn’t mean there aren’t any visual\nclues here.
A3_Q0220_TIM_100_30	Visual clues, huh...
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_100_50	For now, let’s just look around the ruins for anything\nthat seems unusual.
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_100_60	We can think about the mechanism afterward.
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_200_10	I don’t think we have enough information to figure\nout how this mechanism works.
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_200_20	Let’s investigate these ruins more.
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_300_10	Did you figure out how we can get past the\nAegislash relief?
A3_Q0220_TIM_400_10	What if we have the statues hold the same Berries as\nthe Passimian in the murals?
A3_Q0220_TIM_400_20	You know how both the statues and murals\ndepict Passimian?
A3_Q0220_TIM_400_30	That makes me think they’re both connected to the\nmechanism.
A3_Q0220_TIM_400_40	The Passimian in the murals are holding Berries, but\nthe Passimian statues aren’t...
A3_Q0220_TIM_400_50	So, I think we need to make the statues match\nthe murals.
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_400_10	Ah, I get what you’re saying! We could probably pull\nthat off by placing Berries on the statues.
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_400_20	The statues look like they’re perfectly posed for\nholding Berries too.
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_400_30	There’s just one problem, though.
A3_Q0220_TIM_400_60	Yeah. Each mural depicts a different Berry.
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_400_40	Exactly. Which probably means we need to give each\nof the three statues a different Berry.
A3_Q0220_TIM_400_70	But what Berry are we supposed to give to\nwhich statue?
A3_Q0220_TIM_500_10	What if we changed the expressions on the statues to\nmatch the ones in the murals?
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_500_10	The murals do each depict a different expression, but\nI don’t think we can change the way the statues look.
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_500_20	I think the expressions in the murals are a clue to\nsomething else.
A3_Q0220_TIM_600_10	Of the three murals, only the middle one is frozen.
A3_Q0220_TIM_600_20	Why don’t we try freezing the middle statue to\nmatch it?
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_600_10	I’m pretty sure the mural’s only frozen because of how\ncold the ruins are right now.
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_600_20	I doubt it has anything to do with the mechanism.
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_800_10	It looks like we didn’t get all the info we need yet.
A3_Q0220_PIKACHU_800_20	Let’s take another good look at the murals.
A3_Q0310_TIM_100_10	What Berry should we place on the statue to the left?
A3_Q0310_PIKACHU_100_10	I think it’s only natural to assume that the leftmost\nmural and statue correspond to each other.
A3_Q0310_TIM_100_20	And that mural depicts a yellow Berry and a happy\nPassimian.
A3_Q0310_PIKACHU_100_20	I bet that Passimian’s expression is a clue about\nthe flavor.
A3_Q0310_TIM_100_30	Could it be smiling because it ate something sweet?
A3_Q0310_PIKACHU_100_30	Exactly what I was thinking. Which means we need to\nplace a sweet, yellow Berry on the statue.
A3_Q0310_PIKACHU_100_40	OK! Let’s go find a Berry that ticks those boxes!
A3_Q0310_PIKACHU_200_10	I don’t think we have a Berry that meets the\nconditions yet.
A3_Q0310_PIKACHU_200_20	We should do a thorough check of the Berries\ngrowing near the ruins.
A3_Q0310_PIKACHU_300_10	Which Berry should we place on the statue to\nthe left?
A3_Q0310_PIKACHU_300_20	Did you figure out which Berry is yellow and sweet?
A3_Q0310_TIM_400_10	If the Berry needs to be sweet and yellow, then I think\nwe need a Shuca Berry.
A3_Q0310_PIKACHU_400_10	Makes sense. The Shuca Berry’s color and flavor are\nexactly what we’re looking for.
A3_Q0310_PIKACHU_400_20	OK! Let’s bring one to the statue!
A3_Q0310_PIKACHU_500_10	That’s the right color, but what about the flavor?
A3_Q0310_TIM_500_10	Oh, yeah. Pinap Berries are sour and spicy. Guess they\nwouldn’t do...
A3_Q0310_PIKACHU_600_10	That’s the right flavor, but what about the color?
A3_Q0310_TIM_600_10	Oh, yeah. Nanab Berries are pink. Guess they\nwouldn’t do...
A3_Q0310_PIKACHU_800_10	Why don’t we go check out the trees around\nthe ruins?
A3_Q0410_TIM_100_10	What Berry should we place on the statue to\nthe right?
A3_Q0410_PIKACHU_100_10	I bet the answer is in the rightmost mural.
A3_Q0410_TIM_100_20	The mural on the right depicts a blue Berry and a\nPassimian with a puckered-up face.
A3_Q0410_PIKACHU_100_20	I’m sure that’s the face someone makes when they’ve\njust eaten something sour...
A3_Q0410_PIKACHU_100_30	Which means that the answer’s gotta be a sour, blue\nBerry!
A3_Q0410_PIKACHU_100_40	Let’s go find a Berry that ticks those boxes, Tim!
A3_Q0410_PIKACHU_200_10	I don’t think we have a Berry that meets the\nconditions yet.
A3_Q0410_PIKACHU_200_20	We should do a thorough check of the Berries\ngrowing near the ruins.
A3_Q0410_PIKACHU_300_10	Which Berry should we place on the statue to\nthe right?
A3_Q0410_PIKACHU_300_20	Do you know which Berry is blue and sour?
A3_Q0410_TIM_400_10	If it’s supposed to be a blue, sour Berry, then I think\nwe need a Yache Berry.
A3_Q0410_PIKACHU_400_10	Yep. If it checks all the boxes, it’s gotta be right.
A3_Q0410_PIKACHU_400_20	OK! Let’s take one to the statue!
A3_Q0410_PIKACHU_500_10	That’s the right color, but what about the flavor?
A3_Q0410_TIM_500_10	Oh, yeah. Coba Berries are bitter. Guess they\nwouldn’t do...
A3_Q0410_PIKACHU_600_10	That’s the right flavor, but what about the color?
A3_Q0410_TIM_600_10	Oh, yeah. Pinap Berries are yellow. Guess they\nwouldn’t do...
A3_Q0410_PIKACHU_800_10	Why don’t we go check out the trees around\nthe ruins?
A3_Q0510_TIM_100_10	What Berry should we place on the middle statue?
A3_Q0510_PIKACHU_100_10	We couldn’t examine the middle mural because it was\nfrozen over.
A3_Q0510_PIKACHU_100_20	We’ve gotta figure out what to do about that ice first.
A3_Q0510_TIM_100_20	I don’t think there’s anything we can do to get rid of\nice that thick.
A3_Q0510_PIKACHU_100_30	True. In that case, I think we should get some help\nfrom a Pokémon!
A3_Q0510_TIM_100_30	Yeah, there were lots of Pokémon outside the ruins.
A3_Q0510_PIKACHU_100_40	Let’s go ask the Pokémon if any of them can help.
A3_Q0510_PIKACHU_200_10	Let’s go look for a Pokémon outside the ruins that can\nmelt ice.
A3_Q0510_PIKACHU_300_10	Did you find any Pokémon who could help us get rid\nof the ice?
A3_Q0510_TIM_400_10	Monferno could melt the ice with its flames.
A3_Q0510_PIKACHU_400_10	Yep! Some heat oughta melt all that ice! Maybe this\none was too easy...
A3_Q0510_TIM_400_20	Monferno seemed to be struggling in this cold,\nthough... I wonder if it’d be willing to help us.
A3_Q0510_PIKACHU_400_20	Monferno said it’s confident about its fire skills.\nMaybe if we butter it up a bit, it’ll agree to help.
A3_Q0510_PIKACHU_400_30	Just leave the talking to Pokémon to me.
A3_Q0510_TIM_500_10	Maybe we can break the ice by having Passimian\nthrow a Berry at it.
A3_Q0510_PIKACHU_500_10	Did you see how thick that ice is? Passimian could\nthrow Berries at it all day and not even leave a dent.
A3_Q0510_TIM_500_20	Oh. Right...
A3_Q0510_TIM_600_10	Didn’t Slowpoke tell us that he sprayed water on\na mural?
A3_Q0510_TIM_600_20	What if we have him spray the mural? Maybe that’ll\nmelt the ice.
A3_Q0510_PIKACHU_600_10	With how cold it is in here, the water’s more likely to\nfreeze than melt.
A3_Q0510_TIM_600_30	If only Slowpoke could spray hot water...
A3_Q0510_TIM_700_10	What if we got Munchlax to eat the ice?
A3_Q0510_PIKACHU_700_10	Munchlax isn’t tall enough to reach the top half of the\nmural, though.
A3_Q0510_TIM_700_20	Oh, yeah. Good point...
A3_Q0510_PIKACHU_800_10	There might be a Pokémon that can help. Let’s search\noutside the ruins a little more.
A3_Q0520_TIM_100_10	The middle mural depicts a Passimian that’s holding a\nred Berry and breathing fire.
A3_Q0520_PIKACHU_100_10	I’m sure that Passimian’s expression is supposed to\nmean it ate something spicy.
A3_Q0520_TIM_100_20	Which means we should place a spicy, red Berry on\nthe middle statue.
A3_Q0520_TIM_100_30	I wonder if there are any Berries that meet\nthose conditions.
A3_Q0520_PIKACHU_100_20	Why don’t we go search outside the ruins?
A3_Q0520_TIM_100_40	Yeah, let’s think about what Berry would work.
A3_Q0520_PIKACHU_200_10	We still haven’t found a spicy, red Berry.
A3_Q0520_PIKACHU_300_10	Did you figure out which Berry is red and spicy?
A3_Q0520_PIKACHU_400_10	That’s right! Tamato Berries do have the right color\nand flavor.
A3_Q0520_PIKACHU_400_20	But according to Chris, there aren’t any Tamato\nBerries around here...
A3_Q0520_TIM_400_10	Hmm... What should we do, then?
A3_Q0520_PIKACHU_500_10	That’s the right color, but what about the flavor?
A3_Q0520_TIM_500_10	Oh, yeah. Haban Berries are bitter. Guess they\nwouldn’t do...
A3_Q0520_PIKACHU_600_10	That’s the right flavor, but what about the color?
A3_Q0520_TIM_600_10	Oh, yeah. Pinap Berries are yellow. Guess they\nwouldn’t do...
A3_Q0520_PIKACHU_800_10	Why don’t we go take a look at the trees around\nthe ruins?
A3_Q0530_PIKACHU_100_10	We can’t follow Gordon without a Tamato Berry.
A3_Q0530_TIM_100_10	How did the professor manage to solve this\npuzzle, anyway?
A3_Q0530_PIKACHU_100_20	Gordon must’ve brought a Tamato Berry here\nwith him. Chris had some that he used in his\ncurry, remember?
A3_Q0530_TIM_100_20	Yeah, that’s true...
A3_Q0530_PIKACHU_100_30	We can’t activate the mechanism the same way\nGordon did.
A3_Q0530_PIKACHU_100_40	All we can do now is look for something else we can\nuse in the Tamato Berry’s place.
A3_Q0530_TIM_100_30	Like what?
A3_Q0530_PIKACHU_100_50	Seems like we just need to meet two conditions for\nthe statues—color and flavor.
A3_Q0530_PIKACHU_100_60	If you think about it, we may not even need a Berry as\nlong as those two conditions are met!
A3_Q0530_TIM_100_40	So we should look for something that’s spicy and red\nlike a Tamato Berry...
A3_Q0530_TIM_100_50	It’s worth a shot, I suppose.
A3_Q0530_PIKACHU_100_70	It sounds like Chris brought a buncha stuff with him.\nLet’s go ask him what he’s got.
A3_Q0530_PIKACHU_100_80	Maybe he’s got something we can use!
A3_Q0530_TIM_100_60	Sounds good. Let’s go talk to Chris!
A3_Q0530_PIKACHU_200_10	Let’s go check in with Chris. He might have brought a\ncooking ingredient that we can use.
A3_Q0530_PIKACHU_300_10	Did you find anything that we could use as a\nsubstitute for a Tamato Berry?
A3_Q0530_TIM_400_10	I wonder if we could just use this Tamato Berry curry\ninstead.
A3_Q0530_PIKACHU_400_10	Hmm... It DOES have Tamato Berries in it.
A3_Q0530_PIKACHU_400_20	Seems like our best bet for a substitute.
A3_Q0530_TIM_400_20	Let’s go try it out!
A3_Q0530_PIKACHU_400_30	Yeah! We just need to ask Chris for some of his curry!
A3_Q0530_PIKACHU_500_10	Yeah, the apple’s red, but the Passimian in the mural\nlooked like it ate something spicy, remember?
A3_Q0530_TIM_500_10	Oh, yeah. Apples aren’t spicy. Guess this won’t do...
A3_Q0530_PIKACHU_600_10	Yeah, those chips are the right flavor, but what about\nthe color?
A3_Q0530_TIM_600_10	Oh, yeah. They’re the wrong color. Guess they\nwon’t do...
A3_Q0530_PIKACHU_800_10	Something we can use as a substitute... Hey, did you\ntry asking Chris?
A3_Q0610_PIKACHU_100_10	Can you believe Slowpoke? Guy could’ve given us a\nheads-up BEFORE he filled the hole with water and\nswam off without us...
A3_Q0610_TIM_100_10	It’s too cold for us to swim across.
A3_Q0610_PIKACHU_100_20	But not cold enough to freeze all that water solid,\nwhich is a problem.
A3_Q0610_TIM_100_20	We could get across if we laid a bridge over it.
A3_Q0610_PIKACHU_100_30	Do you see anything we could use as a bridge?
A3_Q0610_TIM_100_30	Well, no... And I’m sure Chris wouldn’t have anything\nwe could use, either.
A3_Q0610_TIM_100_40	Should we get help from a Pokémon again?
A3_Q0610_PIKACHU_100_40	Yeah, that’s a good idea!
A3_Q0610_PIKACHU_100_50	We need a Pokémon that can help us cross the water.\nLet’s go look for one!
A3_Q0610_PIKACHU_200_10	Let’s look for a Pokémon that can help us. I bet\nthere’s one somewhere outside the ruins.
A3_Q0610_PIKACHU_300_10	Did you see any Pokémon that could help us get\nacross the water?
A3_Q0610_TIM_400_10	The Lotad said they can carry Pokémon while\nthey swim.
A3_Q0610_TIM_400_20	If we asked them to act as stepping stones for us, do\nyou think we could get to the other side?
A3_Q0610_PIKACHU_400_10	If we crossed one at a time, I think they could handle\nthe three of us.
A3_Q0610_PIKACHU_400_20	All right! Let’s go talk to those Lotad!
A3_Q0610_PIKACHU_400_30	I’m sure they’ll be willing to help!
A3_Q0610_TIM_500_10	What if we asked Passimian to throw a rope to the\nother side?
A3_Q0610_PIKACHU_500_10	Hmm... Is there anything around here we could even\nuse for a rope?
A3_Q0610_TIM_500_20	Not that I saw...
A3_Q0610_TIM_600_10	If we got Munchlax to drink all the water, we could\ncross the hole without getting wet.
A3_Q0610_PIKACHU_600_10	Wouldn’t removing the water make it harder to\nget across?
A3_Q0610_TIM_600_20	True... It’s probably better to think of a way to cross\nthe water, not drain it.
A3_Q0610_PIKACHU_800_10	Maybe there are some Pokémon we still gotta talk to.\nLet’s take a look outside the ruins.
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_100_10	According to Gordon, it sounds like there are clues in\nthe murals.
A3_Q0710_TIM_100_10	Yeah—the mural in this room, and the mural in the\nother room.
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_100_20	I think we’ll be able to find a way outta here if we can\nfigure out what those two murals mean.
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_100_30	Let’s go investigate, Tim!
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_200_10	I don’t think we have enough information to solve the\nmystery of the murals yet.
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_200_20	Let’s investigate both murals!
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_300_10	Well, we’ve examined both murals. Did you learn\nanything?
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_300_20	The murals seem to be hinting at something.\nLet’s figure out what it is together.
A3_Q0710_TIM_400_10	Both murals depict footprints moving away from\na statue.
A3_Q0710_TIM_400_20	Could that mean we need to move the statues in the\nsame direction as the footprints?
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_400_10	Hmm... The footprints are moving away from the\nstatues, so we should move the statues the same\ndirection...
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_400_20	I think you might be on to something there.
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_400_30	But we’ve still got one problem—and it’s a big one.
A3_Q0710_TIM_400_30	Yeah. We don’t know where those statues are.
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_400_40	Exactly. Even if we understand the clue, it’s useless if\nwe can’t find the mechanism itself.
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_400_50	There’s gotta be a room on this floor somewhere that\nhas those statues...
A3_Q0710_TIM_400_40	Nothing in the murals indicates that, though.
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_400_60	Hmm... Then, where the heck are the statues?
A3_Q0710_TIM_500_10	Maybe the footprints in the murals indicate where the\nstatues are.
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_500_10	That’s what I thought too, at first.
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_500_20	But look again—see how the footprints are moving\naway from the statues?
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_500_30	That doesn’t seem right if the murals are supposed to\nlead us to them.
A3_Q0710_TIM_600_10	There’s a door depicted in both murals.
A3_Q0710_TIM_600_20	Maybe the murals are showing us where the hidden\nexit is?
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_600_10	If that’s the case, why don’t the footprints LEAD to\nthe exit?
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_600_20	I think the footprints mean something else.
A3_Q0710_PIKACHU_800_10	Looks like we’ve still got more investigating to do.\nLet’s examine the murals carefully.

A3_Drama_PIKACHU_100_20	C’mon, quit playing around.
A3_Drama_PIKACHU_100_30	Wait, huh? Uh-oh!
A3_Drama_PIKACHU_100_40	Isn’t this Slowpoke’s tail?!
A3_Drama_PIKACHU_100_50	Hey, are you OK?

A3_Drama_TIM_200_20	*sigh* Really...?
A3_Drama_TIM_200_30	I should’ve seen this coming.
A3_Drama_PIKACHU_200_30	Don’t just stand there! Help me outta here!
A3_Drama_PIKACHU_200_40	W-wait! Just so we’re clear, I\ndo NOT want you to kick me!

A3_Drama_TIM_300_60	Looks like it worked, at least!
A3_Drama_PIKACHU_300_100	Yeah. All’s well that ends well.
A3_Drama_GHIHIDARUMA_300_60_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cries - happy noises)\n\[What a satisfying meal!\]
A3_Drama_PIKACHU_400_10	Ready, Darmanitan? I’m counting on you!

A3_Drama_GHIHIDARUMA_400_40_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - OK!)
A3_Drama_PIKACHU_500_10	The puzzles in the murals...\nAlso, a maze with a dead end...
A3_Drama_TIM_500_10	What are you thinking, Pikachu?
A3_Drama_PIKACHU_500_20	Of course! It all makes sense now!
A3_Drama_PIKACHU_500_25_NOMESSAGE	(Short grunt of exertion)
A3_Drama_PIKACHU_500_30	A bolt of brilliance!
A3_Drama_PIKACHU_500_40	There’s a mechanism on the\nother side of this wall—!
A3_Drama_PIKACHU_500_50_NOMESSAGE	Wh-wh-whoa!
A3_Drama_TIM_600_10	Huh?

A3_Drama_HAENEMY01_700_10	I-I’m sorry, sir!

A3_Drama_HAENEMY01_700_20	W-well...we did retrieve the meteorites!
A3_Drama_NOFACETRANSCEIVER_700_20	Then get back here—now!
A3_Drama_HAENEMY01_700_30	I swear... Could that guy BE any bossier?

A3_Drama_TIM_700_30	What’d you say?
A3_Drama_TIM_700_40	Are you really sure threatening us\nis a good idea?

A3_Drama_PIKACHU_900_80	Why did you have Harry?
A3_Drama_RHWOMAN01_900_10	Terrible... Pokémon battling in the city?!
A3_Drama_RKMAN02_900_10	It’s just like Mayor Myers told us!
A3_Drama_RCMAN01_900_20	Pokémon have to be managed!
A3_Drama_PIKACHU_900_90	This is not good.
A3_Drama_PIKACHU_900_100	You need to get out of here.
A3_Drama_MEWTWO_900_20	So it would seem.\nDo not worry about that human.
A3_Drama_RACHEL_900_40	Tim, does Pikachu actually know Mewtwo?
A3_Drama_TIM_900_70	You could say that...
A3_Drama_RACHEL_900_50	That’s incredible!
A3_Drama_TIM_900_80	I guess... But where’d those guys take my dad?

A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_100_10	If I could just find Harry...
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_100_20	I feel like I’d remember all\nthe things I’ve forgotten.
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_200_10	Hey, so what do you think\nof Rachel, anyway?
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_200_20	C’mon! Spill it!
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_300_10	Long ago, tons of meteorites fell here\nfrom the sky... And around the same\ntime, these ruins were built...
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_300_20	Meteorites and ruins...
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_300_30	There might be some kind of deep\nconnection between the two.
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_400_10	Did you see the murals in these ruins?
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_400_20	Looks like the humans and Pokémon\nwho once lived here together had\ncomplete trust in each other.
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_400_30	Ironic... Ryme City’s vision of a\nharmonious society was already\nrealized here, ages ago.
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_500_10	Brrr...
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_500_20	You think I’m warm ’cause\nI’m covered in fur?
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_500_30	Cold is cold, OK?!
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_600_10	It’s freezing...
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_600_20	I could REALLY use a hot\ncup of coffee right now.
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_700_10	Hey, Tim. That hoodie\nof yours... Is it warm?
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_700_20	Must be nice having a warm jacket...
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_700_30	Ah...ah...ACHOO!
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_800_10	Y’know, Tim...
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_800_20	The way Slowpoke really\ncares about Gordon...
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_800_30	It’s very relatable.
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_900_10	Hey, Tim.
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_900_20	Darmanitan might look scary,\nbut he’s really a good friend.
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_900_30	Instead of looking for something to eat,\nhe was looking for his pals. What a guy!
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1000_10	A bolt of—!
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1000_20	Oh, wait... No, never mind. Sorry.\nI thought I was gonna have a bolt \nof brilliance...
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1000_30	Guess it was just a false alarm. Sorry!
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1100_10	Must be pretty cold\nwhere you’re from, huh?
A3_PikaTalk_GHIHIDARUMA_1100_10	(Yeah. I never understood what “hot”\nmeant till I was brought here.)
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1100_20	I see. Makes sense why\nyou froze the ruins, then.
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1200_10	So...how’s the family?
A3_PikaTalk_GHIHIDARUMA_1200_10	(Do...do I have to answer that?)
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1200_20	Oh, sorry. Is that a touchy subject? Some\nthings are better left unsaid, I guess.
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1300_10	You waited all this time without\neating anything... You’re a good\nfriend, Darmanitan.
A3_PikaTalk_GHIHIDARUMA_1300_10	(My friends who escaped\nwith me are like family!)
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1300_20	Ah... I can see that.
A3_PikaTalk_GHIHIDARUMA_1300_20	(So let’s hurry up and find them!)
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1300_30	Yeah! Of course!
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1400_10	Hey, Darmanitan! Do you think you\ncould slow down and run a bit gentler?
A3_PikaTalk_GHIHIDARUMA_1400_10	(Why?)
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1400_20	My jaw keeps slamming shut!\nI feel like I’m gonna bite my\ntongue with all this bouncing!
A3_PikaTalk_GHIHIDARUMA_1400_20	(This is the only way I can run!)
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1400_30	C’mon, you’ve gotta do something!\nAre you even listening to me?!
A3_PikaTalk_GHIHIDARUMA_1400_30	(Don’t like it? Then get off!)
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1400_40	Aaaahhh!
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1500_10	Hm? I can feel a breeze, even\nthough we’re underground...
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1500_20	What strange ruins...
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1600_10	Huh?
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1600_20	Whoa-whoa-whoa-AAAHHHHHH!!!
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1600_30	Ouch!
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1600_40	Watch your step, Tim. It’s, uh, slippery here.
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1700_10	Hey, Munchlax. Is it true that you eat\nyour own weight in food every day?
A3_PikaTalk_GONBE_1700_10	(Yeah. So what?)
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1700_20	Must be hard on Chris...
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1800_10	Hey, Lotad!
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1800_20	How does it feel to live your\nlife floating on the water?
A3_PikaTalk_HASSBOH01_1800_10	(Floating on the water feels sooo nice!)
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1800_30	Wow! What a way to live!
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1900_10	C’mon, Tim...\nWhy aren’t you answering me?
A3_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1900_20	You still understand me, don’t you?

A3_SRT_PIKACHU_6300_10	Not bad! You have a good eye for detail!
A3_SRT_RACHEL_100_10	Why don’t you understand, Papa?!
A3_SRT_RACHEL_100_20	Pokémon don’t need to be “managed”!\nThe people who use them to commit\ncrimes are the real problem!
A3_SRT_HOWARD_100_10	Rachel... No matter how many times\nwe have this same conversation, I’m\nnot going to change my mind.
A3_SRT_RACHEL_100_30	You never listen!

A3_SRT_PIKACHU_6500_30	Lemme catch my breath first!\nThat’s no way to treat a Pokémon...
A3_SRT_PIKACHU_6500_40	Oh!
A3_SRT_PIKACHU_6500_50	This tile has the same design as the one\ndown there.
A3_SRT_PIKACHU_1600_5	*sigh* Gotta climb up again...
A3_SRT_TIM_1600_10	OK, Pikachu! You press that one.
A3_SRT_PIKACHU_1600_10	Yep! Leave it to me!
A3_SRT_TIM_1600_20	Yes!
A3_SRT_TIM_600_10	I see something moving...
A3_SRT_PIKACHU_600_10	Hmmm... Looks like a suspicious shadow.
A3_SRT_PIKACHU_600_20	I’m curious to know what it is,\nbut we should look into it later.

A3_SRT_TIM_1000_10	It’s that Slowpoke again.
A3_SRT_RACHEL_1000_10	He must have followed us here because\nhe’s worried about the professor.
A3_SRT_PIKACHU_1000_10	Makes sense. You are partners, after all!

A3_SRT_TIM_2100_30	A Pokémon?!

A3_V3.asset
A3_V3_GORDON_1900_10	All right, Tim. You think you\ncan use your detective skills\nto help us get out of here?
A3_V3_TIM_1900_10	Sure!
A3_V3_RACHEL_1900_10	With you two working together,\nI’m sure we’ll find the way out!
A3_V3_GORDON_3600_10	Based on what we’ve experienced\nso far, we should be able to get out\nif we can get this door open.
A3_V3_GORDON_3600_20	I wonder if there are\nany clues in this room.
A3_V3_TIM_2000_10	Wasn’t there a mural depicting a\nClefairy statue and some footprints?
A3_V3_TIM_2000_20	That mural may be the key to\nsolving the mystery of this room.
A3_V3_GORDON_2000_10	I think you’re right. The tiles here\nmatch the squares in that mural too.
A3_V3_PIKACHU_2100_10	Really? I don’t see the connection.
A3_V3_PIKACHU_2100_20	Think back to what we saw\nduring our investigation!
A3_V3_GORDON_2200_10	If that’s the case...the mural in the\nroom I was in must be related too.
A3_V3_GORDON_2200_20	However... Looking around, I’m not\nseeing a statue of a human in here.
A3_V3_TIM_2300_10	Do you remember where the human\nstatue was located in the mural itself?
A3_V3_GORDON_2300_10	Of course I remember. I was staring\nat that thing for two days straight.
A3_V3_GORDON_2300_20	The human statue was in the\nsecond row from the top, on the\nleftmost side of the mural.
A3_V3_TIM_2300_20	And if we assume these tiles are laid\nout the same as those in the mural...
A3_V3_GORDON_2300_30	There! That chunk of ice!
A3_V3_PIKACHU_2300_10	All right, looks like you’re up!
A3_V3_GHIHIDARUMA_2300_3_NOMESSAGE	PKMN cry
A3_V3_GHIHIDARUMA_2300_6_NOMESSAGE	PKMN cry
A3_V3_GHIHIDARUMA_2300_10_NOMESSAGE	Daaaar! (Take that!)
A3_V3_GORDON_2300_40	So it was hiding here the whole time...
A3_V3_PIKACHU_2400_10	Hold on... You don’t have\nany evidence of that.
A3_V3_PIKACHU_2400_20	Try and remember the other mural!
A3_V3_GORDON_2500_10	OK, so...we’ve got the two statues, but\nwhat are we supposed to do now?
A3_V3_GORDON_2500_20	I’m sure the murals must have a clue\nas to how the mechanism works.
A3_V3_TIM_2600_10	There are footprints\ndepicted in the murals.
A3_V3_TIM_2600_20	They must indicate the paths\nto move the stone statues!
A3_V3_GORDON_2600_10	So that’s what they represent!
A3_V3_RACHEL_2600_10	Let’s give it a try.
A3_V3_GORDON_2600_20	Hey, Tim. Come give me a hand.
A3_V3_TIM_2600_30	Yeah!
A3_V3_GORDON_2600_30	What’s going on? Nothing’s happening.
A3_V3_TIM_2600_40	Huh. I was sure that would work...
A3_V3_PIKACHU_2700_10	C’mon, Tim!
A3_V3_PIKACHU_2700_20	We literally just figured this one out!
A3_V3_GORDON_2800_10	Now that I see the two statues next\nto each other, the way they’re posed\nlooks somehow meaningful...
A3_V3_TIM_2800_10	Isn’t coexistence between humans\nand Pokémon a recurring theme\nin these ruins?
A3_V3_GORDON_2800_20	Yeah. The decor and artifacts\nhere all attest to that.
A3_V3_PIKACHU_2800_10	You see it, too, don’t you, Tim?
A3_V3_TIM_2800_20	Mm-hm!
A3_V3_TIM_2900_10	A pose that symbolizes coexistence\nbetween humans and Pokémon...
A3_V3_TIM_2900_20	Something that represents both sides\ncooperating, working hand in hand...
A3_V3_GORDON_2900_10	That’s it! We need the\nstatues to hold hands!
A3_V3_GORDON_2900_20	But the left statue’s hand is missing.\nWhat can we do about that?
A3_V3_RACHEL_2900_10	Could we use a Pokémon move?
A3_V3_PIKACHU_3000_10	Even if you did that with the statues,\nwhat’s that got to do with coexistence?!
A3_V3_PIKACHU_3000_20	You’re gonna fail at this rate!
A3_V3_TIM_3100_10	Good idea, Rachel!
A3_V3_TIM_3100_20	And we’ve got the perfect\nallies right here with us!
A3_V3_GHIHIDARUMA_3100_10_NOMESSAGE	PKMN cry
A3_V3_KORIPPOI_3100_10_NOMESSAGE	PKMN cry
A3_V3_YADON_3100_10_NOMESSAGE	PKMN cry
A3_V3_PIKACHU_3100_10	That includes me, right?
A3_V3_GORDON_3100_10	So then...who should we ask for help?
A3_V3_TIM_3200_10	That’s it! Let’s ask Eiscue to help.
A3_V3_RACHEL_3200_10	Eiscue?
A3_V3_KORIPPON_3200_10_NOMESSAGE	Eis? (What?)
A3_V3_GORDON_3200_10	I see! I hadn’t thought of that!
A3_V3_PIKACHU_3300_10	All we’ve got to do is get\nthe statues to hold hands.
A3_V3_PIKACHU_3300_20	Isn’t there a Pokémon who can do that?\nThink about the moves they know.
A3_V3_PIKACHU_3400_10	You’ve got this, Eiscue!
A3_V3_KORIPPOI_3400_10_NOMESSAGE	Eis eis (OK.)
A3_V3_KORIPPOI_3400_20_NOMESSAGE	Cuuueee!
A3_V3_TIM_3400_10	Whoa!
A3_V3_RACHEL_3400_10	Yes!
A3_V3_GORDON_3400_10	Thank you, Tim.
A3_V3_GORDON_3400_20	Hey, maybe you should come\nto my class as a guest lecturer!
A3_V3_GORDON_3400_30	Ha ha ha!
A3_V3_RACHEL_3400_20	Oh, I’d love to see that!
A4.asset
A4_0110_TIM_100_1000	Good morning, Pikachu. How’d you sleep?
A4_0110_PIKACHU_100_1000	Like a log! Nothing quite like sleeping in your own\nbed. Waking up in it just feels different.
A4_0110_PIKACHU_100_2000	Especially when you’re comin’ from that bed at the\npolice station. It was like sleeping on rocks...
A4_0110_TIM_100_2000	I’ve been worried about you after you fainted again\nyesterday. How are you feeling?
A4_0110_PIKACHU_100_3000	Don’t waste your worries on me—I feel great!
A4_0110_TIM_100_3000	In that case, I guess you’ll be able to come along to\nBamboo Borough and look for Jessica.
A4_0110_PIKACHU_100_4000	Yep. Butler’s in custody, but that doesn’t mean\nJessica’s safe.
A4_0110_TIM_100_4000	Agreed. We’d better check on her ASAP to make sure\nshe’s OK.
A4_0110_PIKACHU_100_5000	And that photo... I’d like to know more about what\nwas going on when it was taken.
A4_0110_TIM_100_5000	We’ll have to ask Jessica how she knows the people\nin it.
A4_0110_PIKACHU_100_6000	Right on, Tim. Now you’re thinkin’ like a detective!
A4_0110_TIM_100_6000	I am a detective...
A4_0110_PIKACHU_100_7000	Welp, time to get moving. Let’s go!
A4_0130_SOPHIA_100_1000	Was the coffee good, Pikachu?
A4_0130_PIKACHU_100_1000	It tasted fantastic, Sophia! I mean how could it not,\nafter you made it just for me?
A4_0130_SOPHIA_100_2000	Hee hee! ♪
A4_0130_TIM_100_1000	I think Pikachu really appreciated that, Sophia.
A4_0140_IRENE_100_1000	It was quite startling when Pikachu fainted last night.
A4_0140_IRENE_100_2000	I suppose it’s understandable, considering he was\nbeing held at the police station—but the same thing\nhappened during dinner the other day too...
A4_0140_IRENE_100_3000	I think the two of you may be pushing yourselves a bit\ntoo hard. Why don’t you take today to rest?
A4_0140_TIM_100_1000	I wish we could, but there’s still a lot to investigate.\nPikachu’s raring to go, too.
A4_0140_IRENE_100_4000	Hmm. Why don’t you take it easy until lunch, then?
A4_0140_TIM_100_2000	Thanks, but we’re already getting a late start.\nWe’ve really gotta head out.
A4_0140_IRENE_100_5000	Of course you do.
A4_0140_TIM_100_3000	Sorry! We’ll see you later.
A4_0140_IRENE_200_1000	Just try not to work TOO hard, OK?
A4_0140_TIM_200_1000	I’ll try, Mom.
A4_0150_TIM_100_1000	It’s the morning paper. Guess I’ll give it a quick read.
A4_0150_PIKACHU_100_1000	Even the smallest articles can offer vital info.
A4_0150_PIKACHU_200_1000	Any interesting articles?
A4_0160_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s check out the news before we head out.
A4_0160_TIM_100_1000	They’re doing a report on the case involving Butler.
A4_0160_TIM_200_1000	They’re doing a report on the case involving Butler.
A4_0180_TIM_100_1000	Hopefully this means the PPB will stop detaining\ninnocent Pokémon now.
A4_0180_PIKACHU_100_1000	Probably, yeah.
A4_0180_PIKACHU_100_2000	But that still leaves Unitas, the organization Butler was\nworking with.
A4_0180_PIKACHU_100_3000	Not to mention those cube devices...
A4_0180_PIKACHU_100_4000	I think it’ll be a while till we can solve those mysteries.
A4_0180_TIM_100_2000	Until then, we have to do what we can to stop Unitas\nfrom causing any more harm!
A4_0180_PIKACHU_100_5000	My thoughts exactly.
A4_0190_TIM_100_1000	Let’s go, Pikachu.
A4_0190_PIKACHU_100_1000	Right.
A4_0510_TIM_100_1000	It’s an article about Chief Butler.
A4_0510_PIKACHU_100_1000	You mean “former” Chief Butler.
A4_0510_PIKACHU_100_2000	He captured innocent Pokémon and exchanged them\nfor money.
A4_0510_PIKACHU_100_3000	There’s no way he’s keeping his title after that.
A4_0510_TIM_100_2000	Seems like all the Pokémon being detained at the\npolice station were able to return to their homes.
A4_0510_TIM_100_3000	And the police are searching for the Pokémon that\nwere sent to Unitas.
A4_0510_PIKACHU_100_4000	Looks like Brad’s team is handling that.
A4_0510_PIKACHU_100_5000	It’s the least they can do after they went around\narresting all of us innocent Pokémon!
A4_0610_TIM_100_1000	It’s an article about the Gossifleur choir concert.
A4_0610_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s the group you saved from disbanding, right?
A4_0610_TIM_100_2000	I don’t know if I’d go THAT far...
A4_0610_TIM_100_3000	Still, I didn’t expect to see them in the newspaper.\nThey’re a bigger deal than I thought.
A4_0610_TIM_100_4000	It says here their concert tickets tend to sell out fast.
A4_0610_TIM_100_5000	Guess it’s a good thing we managed to find them all!
A4_0610_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yep. Looks like they made it to the next stop on their\ntour no problem.
A4_0610_TIM_100_6000	Let’s go see them next time they’re in Ryme City!
A4_0610_PIKACHU_100_3000	Sounds good to me. We should check out their\nconcert schedule.
A4_0620_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s an interview with a top-rated chef in Ryme City.
A4_0620_TIM_100_1000	Oh hey, I see them on TV all the time.
A4_0620_TIM_100_2000	I think their catchphrase is something like, “Heat is\nparamount when it comes to cooking!”
A4_0620_PIKACHU_100_2000	They sound pretty fired up about cooking heat in this\ninterview too.
A4_0620_PIKACHU_100_3000	According to them, a flame as “fervent, fierce, and\nfocused as a Pignite’s” produces the ideal cooking\nheat.
A4_0620_TIM_100_3000	Huh. Kinda surprised they’d use Pignite as the\nstandard.
A4_0620_TIM_100_4000	There’s gotta be lots of other Pokémon that can\ncreate stronger flames than Pignite, right?
A4_0620_PIKACHU_100_4000	Maybe if the flame’s too strong, the food just burns\nto a crisp.
A4_0620_TIM_100_5000	I see... Guess there’s more to cooking than I realized.
A4_0630_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m just glad there are people out there doing this\nkind of research.
A4_0630_TIM_100_1000	“Where does Furret’s body end and its tail begin?”
A4_0630_PIKACHU_100_2000	Seems like the researchers involved in this debate\ncouldn’t reach a conclusion.
A4_0630_TIM_100_2000	This topic’s come up a few times before, right?
A4_0630_TIM_100_3000	But no one’s been able to find a real answer.
A4_0630_PIKACHU_100_3000	See, no one has that problem when they look at me.\nMy body’s here and my tail’s back there. Easy!
A4_0630_PIKACHU_100_4000	Furret, though... That’s a completely different story.
A4_0630_PIKACHU_100_5000	Not even a great detective like me could get to the\nbottom of that mystery.
A4_0640_PIKACHU_100_1000	What’s this photo? Did someone throw paint all over\nthat wall?
A4_0640_TIM_100_1000	Oh, that’s Ryme City’s hot new tourist spot.
A4_0640_TIM_100_2000	Originally, it was just the product of some Aipom\nplaying pranks.
A4_0640_TIM_100_3000	There was some debate about whether the wall\nshould be repainted...
A4_0640_TIM_100_4000	But now, it’s apparently considered a popular piece of\nmodern art.
A4_0640_PIKACHU_100_2000	A Pokémon prank turned modern art, huh?
A4_0640_PIKACHU_100_3000	The world really is full of surprises.
A4_0640_TIM_100_5000	Do you think the Aipom could’ve been trying to make\nart on purpose?
A4_0640_PIKACHU_100_4000	Eh, I doubt it.
A4_0640_PIKACHU_100_5000	We should ask next time we see ’em.
A4_0650_TIM_100_1000	I wonder what happened to that Taillow.
A4_0650_PIKACHU_100_1000	Is that the one you met while I was detained?
A4_0650_PIKACHU_100_2000	If it ended up living near Fountain Plaza, I’m sure it’ll\neventually stop feeling homesick.
A4_0650_PIKACHU_100_3000	That place gets a lot of foot traffic, y’know?
A4_0650_TIM_100_2000	Yeah. I always see people and Pokémon there.
A4_0650_PIKACHU_100_4000	During the colder months, Taillow fly south to live\nwhere it’s warmer.
A4_0650_PIKACHU_100_5000	That Taillow’ll probably do the same eventually.
A4_0650_TIM_100_3000	Well, I hope it enjoys its time here until then.
A4_0660_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s a feature on the Machamp that work\nalongside humans.
A4_0660_TIM_100_1000	They work as movers and help transport goods.\nSome even help direct traffic too.
A4_0660_PIKACHU_100_2000	We saw some unloading containers that time we were\nat the wharf, remember?
A4_0660_PIKACHU_100_3000	They’re big-time strong—and on top of that, they’ve\ngot four arms too!
A4_0660_PIKACHU_100_4000	They might not be my first choice if I need something\ndone with precision, but they’re great for heavy\nlifting!
A4_0660_TIM_100_2000	I can see why their services are in high demand.
A4_0660_PIKACHU_100_5000	Yep—they’re the best at what they do. That’s the kind\nof excellence we should aim for!
A4_0670_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s cross some words, Tim!
A4_0670_TIM_100_1000	“This aromatic Pokémon has a beautiful flower\nblooming on its head.”
A4_0670_PIKACHU_100_2000	Sure sounds like Lilligant to me!
A4_0670_TIM_100_2000	“This Pokémon has fluffy fur around its neck, loves to\nstay clean, and lives as it pleases.”
A4_0670_PIKACHU_100_3000	Oh, oh! I know this one. The answer’s Delcatty!
A4_0670_TIM_100_3000	“This Pokémon prefers secluded places.”
A4_0670_PIKACHU_100_4000	Sounds like the Pokémon I see behind the police\nstation sometimes. I’ll go with...Hatenna!
A4_0670_TIM_100_4000	We didn’t even find those answers together this time,\nbut you still got them all right. Nice going, Pikachu!
A4_0670_PIKACHU_100_5000	Today’s clues were all about Pokémon that live in\nRyme City, right?
A4_0670_PIKACHU_100_6000	As a detective, I gotta make sure I know who my\nneighbors are!
A4_10100_DEKAGOOSE_200_1000	Shoos...
A4_10100_PIKACHU_200_1000	Don’t look at me like that. I don’t have any more\ncurry...
A4_10100_DEKAGOOSE_300_1000	Shoos...
A4_10100_PIKACHU_300_1000	Hey, I brought you some curry!
A4_10100_TIM_300_1000	Curry buns, to be precise.
A4_10100_DEKAGOOSE_300_2000	Shoos!
A4_10100_PIKACHU_300_2000	If you think they smell amazing, just wait till you\ntaste one!
A4_10100_PIKACHU_300_3000	Wh-whoa! Don’t scarf it all down at once!
A4_10100_DEKAGOOSE_300_3000	Shooos?!
A4_10100_TIM_300_2000	A-are you OK?
A4_10100_PIKACHU_300_4000	It looks like it’s gonna breathe fire!
A4_10100_DEKAGOOSE_300_4000	Shoos! Shoos! Shoooos!
A4_10100_PIKACHU_300_5000	Gumshoos seemed to like it—extreme spiciness\nand all.
A4_10100_DEKAGOOSE_300_5000	Shoos!
A4_10100_PIKACHU_300_6000	It says it’ll be keeping an even closer eye on the joint.
A4_10100_TIM_300_3000	Maybe it’s thinking it can have the leftovers.
A4_10100_DEKAGOOSE_300_6000	Shoos shoos!
A4_10100_PIKACHU_300_7000	All right! Case closed!
A4_10100_TIM_300_4000	I suppose so...
A4_10100_PIKACHU_400_1000	Stay right here. I’ll serve you up the tastiest, spiciest\ncurry you ever sank your teeth into!
A4_10100_DEKAGOOSE_400_1000	Shoos...
A4_10100_DEKAGOOSE_500_1000	Shoos...
A4_10100_PIKACHU_500_1000	Hey! It’s Gumshoos, the Stakeout Pokémon.
A4_10100_TIM_500_1000	It’s staring at the curry place very intensely... I wonder\nwhat’s wrong.
A4_10100_PIKACHU_500_2000	Let’s ask it. Hey, what’re you—?
A4_10100_DEKAGOOSE_500_2000	Shoos!
A4_10100_PIKACHU_500_3000	Whoa! I just wanted to talk. No need to go all aggro...
A4_10100_DEKAGOOSE_500_3000	Shoos shoos.
A4_10100_PIKACHU_500_4000	You’re in the middle of a stakeout and can’t\nchat, huh?
A4_10100_TIM_500_2000	Maybe there was some kind of incident.
A4_10100_DEKAGOOSE_500_4000	Shoos. Shoos shoos...
A4_10100_PIKACHU_500_5000	The people who come outta there always look like\nthey’re in pain.
A4_10100_PIKACHU_500_6000	There must be something rotten going on in there...or\nso it says.
A4_10100_TIM_500_3000	They probably look like they’re in pain because they\nate something spicy.
A4_10100_PIKACHU_500_7000	That tracks—it IS a curry place, after all.
A4_10100_DEKAGOOSE_500_5000	Shoos shoooos!
A4_10100_PIKACHU_500_8000	Nah, there’s nothing rotten going on in there. They\njust ate something spicy.
A4_10100_DEKAGOOSE_500_6000	Shoos...?
A4_10100_PIKACHU_500_9000	You look like you don’t believe me.
A4_10100_PIKACHU_500_10000	All right, then. I’ll have you try the curry for yourself!
A4_10100_PIKACHU_500_11000	Let’s go, Tim!
A4_10100_TIM_500_4000	I didn’t agree to this...
A4_10110_BKWOMAN02_200_1000	Seems like we’ve got more curry fans now.
A4_10110_BKWOMAN02_300_1000	A customer just bought so many curry buns, he could\nbarely carry them all—even with both hands.
A4_10110_BKWOMAN02_300_2000	Personally, I think his eyes were bigger than his\nstomach.
A4_10110_BKWOMAN02_400_1000	Hi there. Were you looking to buy some curry?\nUnfortunately, we just sold out. Sorry ’bout that.
A4_10110_PIKACHU_400_1000	What?!
A4_10110_BKWOMAN02_400_2000	Lucky for me, I had a lot of customers today.
A4_10110_BKWOMAN02_400_3000	So I’m about to start prepping the curry for this\nevening.
A4_10110_TIM_400_1000	Sounds like it’ll be a while before it’s ready.
A4_10110_PIKACHU_400_2000	But how am I gonna have Gumshoos try the curry...
A4_10110_TIM_400_2000	Sorry you’re disappointed, but there’s nothing we\ncan do.
A4_10110_BKWOMAN02_400_4000	I’m just thinking out loud, mind you...
A4_10110_BKWOMAN02_400_5000	but a customer was just here, and he bought a LOT of\ncurry buns.
A4_10110_BKWOMAN02_400_6000	Personally, I think his eyes were bigger than his\nstomach.
A4_10110_PIKACHU_400_3000	Huh. Maybe he wouldn’t mind sharing one with us?
A4_10110_TIM_400_3000	What did this person look like?
A4_10110_BKWOMAN02_400_7000	Hmm, I believe he was wearing a green hoodie.
A4_10110_PIKACHU_400_4000	Green hoodie. Got it.
A4_10110_TIM_400_4000	Thank you.
A4_10110_PIKACHU_400_5000	He might still be nearby. Let’s go find him!
A4_10110_BKWOMAN02_500_1000	Welcome to the hottest curry spot in Bamboo\nBorough!
A4_10120_BAMAN01_200_1000	Spicy, yet...satisfying!
A4_10120_BAMAN01_300_1000	E-excuse me! C-could you bring me some water?!
A4_10120_TIM_300_1000	Are you OK?
A4_10120_PIKACHU_300_1000	This smell...
A4_10120_BAMAN01_300_2000	This curry bun is so spicy!
A4_10120_PIKACHU_300_2000	Hey! You’re the one who bought all the curry buns!
A4_10120_TIM_300_2000	That’s...a LOT.
A4_10120_BAMAN01_300_3000	I heard they’re really good, so I bought a whole\nbunch...
A4_10120_BAMAN01_300_4000	But I didn’t think they’d be THIS spicy...
A4_10120_BAMAN01_300_5000	Feel free to take some if you’d like.
A4_10120_TIM_300_3000	Are you sure?
A4_10120_BAMAN01_300_6000	There’s no way I can put a dent in these.
A4_10120_PIKACHU_300_3000	This is perfect, eh, Tim?
A4_10120_TIM_300_4000	We’ll take some, then. Thank you!
A4_10120_PIKACHU_300_4000	Let’s go bring this to Gumshoos!
A4_10120_BAMAN01_400_1000	Phew! This curry bun is so spicy!
A4_10120_PIKACHU_400_1000	Eating curry buns on the street? Oh, he must’ve\nbought ’em from that shop over there.
A4_10120_BAMAN01_400_2000	Huh? This Pikachu’s staring right at me...
A4_10120_BAMAN01_400_3000	Maybe it wants some curry buns.
A4_10120_PIKACHU_400_2000	I didn’t say that!
A4_10120_PIKACHU_400_3000	...But if you’re offering, I won’t say no.
A4_10120_TIM_400_1000	S-sorry for bothering you, sir.\nCome on, Pikachu. Let’s go!
A4_1020_PIKACHU_100_1000	All right, Tim. Let’s go find Jessica!
A4_1020_TIM_100_1000	Yeah. We need to make sure that Unitas organization\nisn’t after her.
A4_1020_PIKACHU_100_2000	Guess we don’t have time for any sightseeing while\nwe’re here...
A4_1020_RACHEL_100_1000	Jessica should be working at the pizzeria.
A4_1020_TIM_100_2000	Let’s go there first to see if she’s around.
A4_1020_PIKACHU_100_3000	Right.
A4_1030_RACHEL_100_1000	We need to find Jessica.
A4_10300_KIREIHANA01_200_1000	Som som!
A4_10300_PIKACHU_200_1000	It’s saying the woman right there always cheers\nthem on.
A4_10300_TIM_200_1000	Their dancing is so cute. It’s no wonder they’ve got\nsuch passionate fans!
A4_10300_KIREIHANA01_300_1000	Som sommm!
A4_10300_PIKACHU_300_1000	You just wait here. We’ll find your friends.
A4_10300_KIREIHANA01_400_1000	Som...
A4_10300_PIKACHU_400_1000	It’s a Bellossom.
A4_10300_TIM_400_1000	Don’t you think it’s looking a little antsy?
A4_10300_KIREIHANA01_400_2000	Som som...
A4_10300_PIKACHU_400_2000	Hm, you’re worried about something?
A4_10300_TIM_400_2000	What’s wrong?
A4_10300_PIKACHU_400_3000	Apparently it’s part of a group of Bellossom that put\non dance performances here.
A4_10300_PIKACHU_400_4000	But it’s almost showtime, and the other two Bellossom\nhaven’t arrived yet.
A4_10300_TIM_400_3000	Well, then... Shall we go look for them?
A4_10300_PIKACHU_400_5000	Right on, Tim! I knew you’d ask that.
A4_10300_PIKACHU_400_6000	All right, Bellossom, we’ll help you out!
A4_10300_KIREIHANA01_400_3000	Som sommm!
A4_10310_KIREIHANA02_200_1000	Som som!
A4_10310_PIKACHU_200_1000	What a great performance! I wanna keep watching\nuntil the end.
A4_10310_KIREIHANA02_300_1000	Som som!
A4_10310_PIKACHU_300_1000	It must’ve lost track of time playing with that old man.
A4_10310_KIREIHANA02_400_1000	Som?
A4_10310_PIKACHU_400_1000	Oh, Bellossom. There you are.
A4_10310_PIKACHU_400_2000	Your friends are waiting for you at the usual spot.
A4_10310_KIREIHANA02_400_2000	Som?!
A4_10310_PIKACHU_400_3000	It lost track of time playing with that old man.
A4_10310_PIKACHU_400_4000	They’re waiting for you, so hurry on over there!
A4_10310_KIREIHANA02_400_3000	Som som!
A4_10310_KIREIHANA02_500_1000	Som!
A4_10310_PIKACHU_500_1000	You’re playing a game with that old man? Sounds fun!
A4_10320_KIREIHANA03_200_1000	Som som?
A4_10320_PIKACHU_200_1000	How’s your dancing, you ask? You’re doing great!
A4_10320_KIREIHANA03_300_1000	Som sommm!
A4_10320_PIKACHU_300_1000	Try not to forget about your meeting times.
A4_10320_KIREIHANA03_400_1000	Som som!
A4_10320_TIM_400_1000	Pikachu, this Bellossom must be...
A4_10320_PIKACHU_400_1000	...One that’s making its friend wait.
A4_10320_PIKACHU_400_2000	Hey Bellossom, isn’t there something you’re\nforgetting?
A4_10320_KIREIHANA03_400_2000	Som? Som!
A4_10320_PIKACHU_400_3000	It totally forgot about the performance.
A4_10320_PIKACHU_400_4000	You’re late! You should go to your meeting spot\npronto.
A4_10320_KIREIHANA03_400_3000	Som som!
A4_10320_KIREIHANA03_500_1000	Som sommm!
A4_10320_PIKACHU_500_1000	Oh, you’re busy right now? My bad.
A4_10330_TIM_100_1000	Is that all of them?
A4_10330_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, their performance should be starting now.
A4_10330_TIM_100_2000	Then let’s go watch!
A4_10330_KIREIHANA01_100_1000	Som!
A4_10330_PIKACHU_100_2000	Looks like it just started!
A4_10330_KIREIHANA01_100_2000	Som som!
A4_10330_PIKACHU_100_3000	They’re thanking us—and telling us to enjoy the show!
A4_10330_TIM_100_3000	Oh, we will!
A4_10330_PIKACHU_100_4000	They look so pretty.
A4_1040_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, we’d leave this neighborhood if we went\nthat way!
A4_10400_HOSHIGARISU_200_1000	Skwooovet!
A4_10400_PIKACHU_200_1000	Seems it liked the Nanab Berry.
A4_10400_HOSHIGARISU_300_1000	Skwo!
A4_10400_PIKACHU_300_1000	Hey, Skwovet! We’ve got something for you.
A4_10400_TIM_300_1000	It’s a Nanab Berry! We found it by the pond in the\nbamboo forest.
A4_10400_HOSHIGARISU_300_2000	Skwo?
A4_10400_PIKACHU_300_2000	Try it! It’s really sweet.
A4_10400_HOSHIGARISU_300_3000	... ... ...
A4_10400_HOSHIGARISU_300_4000	Skwo! Swooovet!
A4_10400_PIKACHU_300_3000	See? Nice and sweet, right?
A4_10400_TIM_300_2000	It seems to like the Berry!
A4_10400_HOSHIGARISU_300_5000	Skwo skwo!
A4_10400_PIKACHU_300_4000	Next time you wanna satisfy that sweet tooth of yours,\nyou can find more by the pond in the bamboo forest.
A4_10400_TIM_300_3000	Just don’t go overboard!
A4_10400_HOSHIGARISU_400_1000	Skwooovet!
A4_10400_PIKACHU_400_1000	It wants something sweet. I wonder if we can find a\nsweet Berry around here...
A4_10400_HOSHIGARISU_500_1000	Skwo!
A4_10400_PIKACHU_500_1000	It’s a Skwovet. What’s wrong?
A4_10400_HOSHIGARISU_500_2000	Skwooo...
A4_10400_PIKACHU_500_2000	What? You’re tired of eating curry every day?
A4_10400_TIM_500_1000	Looks like its partner is the owner of the curry place.
A4_10400_HOSHIGARISU_500_3000	Skwooo...
A4_10400_PIKACHU_500_3000	It says it likes the super-spicy curry they make with\nTamato Berries, but...
A4_10400_HOSHIGARISU_500_4000	Skwooovet!
A4_10400_PIKACHU_500_4000	It keeps saying, “I want something sweet! Gimme\nsomething sweeeeeet!”
A4_10400_TIM_500_2000	I wish I could help it out.
A4_10400_PIKACHU_500_5000	I wonder if there are any sweet Berries nearby...
A4_10400_TIM_500_3000	Yeah. If we find one, let’s bring it over here.
A4_10400_HOSHIGARISU_500_5000	Skwo!
A4_10400_PIKACHU_500_6000	There’s only bamboo around here, though...
A4_10400_PIKACHU_500_7000	Don’t get your hopes up too high.
A4_10420_TIM_200_1000	Hmm, this is really strange...
A4_10420_TIM_200_2000	Why is there a Nanab Berry tree in a forest full of\nbamboo?
A4_10420_PIKACHU_200_1000	Someone must’ve planted a Nanab Berry here. What\na weird thing to do.
A4_10420_TIM_300_1000	There are some Berries growing on this tree.
A4_10420_PIKACHU_300_1000	These are...Nanab Berries.
A4_10420_TIM_300_2000	We saw these at the ruins too. How do they taste\nagain?
A4_10420_PIKACHU_300_2000	I already know. Why don’t you try one, Tim?
A4_10420_TIM_300_3000	OK... Oh wow, it’s really sweet!
A4_10420_PIKACHU_300_3000	Right? Let’s bring one to Skwovet.
A4_10420_TIM_300_4000	Yeah. I hope Skwovet likes it!
A4_10420_TIM_400_1000	There are some Berries growing on this tree.
A4_10420_PIKACHU_400_1000	These are...Nanab Berries.
A4_10420_TIM_400_2000	How strange that there’s a Nanab Berry tree in a\nforest full of bamboo.
A4_10420_PIKACHU_400_2000	Someone must’ve planted a Nanab Berry here. What\na weird thing to do.
A4_1050_TIM_100_1000	What a huge gate...
A4_1050_TIM_100_2000	I wonder if it’s—yep. Locked.
A4_1050_TIM_100_3000	If this gate weren’t locked, we could get into the\nbamboo forest through here.
A4_1050_PIKACHU_100_1000	We don’t wanna go forcing our way in, so let’s try\nasking the people in the area for information.
A4_10500_DORONCH_200_1000	Drak.
A4_10500_PIKACHU_200_1000	Make sure you keep an eye on your Dreepy!
A4_10500_DORONCH_300_1000	Draaakloak!
A4_10500_TIM_300_1000	You must be relieved to have Dreepy back!
A4_10500_PIKACHU_300_1000	Looks like everything’s back to normal now.
A4_10500_PIKACHU_300_2000	Hmph... Don’t ever worry Drakloak like that again!
A4_10500_DORONCH_300_2000	Drak.
A4_10500_DORAMESHIYA_300_1000	Dreep!
A4_10500_PIKACHU_300_3000	Huh? You wanna thank me by giving me a ride?
A4_10500_PIKACHU_300_4000	Thanks, but I’ll pass—I’m a little old for Drakloak\nrides.
A4_10500_DORONCHS_400_1000	Draaak.
A4_10500_TIM_400_1000	You know, it’s kinda strange that Drakloak keeps the\nDreepy it cares for on its head.
A4_10500_PIKACHU_400_1000	I wonder what it’s like to ride on top of it...
A4_10500_DORONCHS_400_2000	Drakloak!
A4_10500_PIKACHU_400_2000	Oh no, you don’t gotta give me a ride. Appreciate the\noffer though...
A4_10500_DORONCHS_500_1000	Drak...
A4_10500_TIM_500_1000	Is this Pokémon OK? It looks so sad...
A4_10500_PIKACHU_500_1000	It’s a Drakloak. Something must be bothering it.
A4_10500_PIKACHU_500_2000	What’s wrong, Drakloak?
A4_10500_DORONCHS_500_2000	Draaak!
A4_10500_PIKACHU_500_3000	What? The Dreepy you keep on your head and care\nfor went missing?
A4_10500_TIM_500_2000	Did you say...on its head?
A4_10500_PIKACHU_500_4000	Yeah. Drakloak carry Pokémon called Dreepy around\non their heads.
A4_10500_PIKACHU_500_5000	Where did Dreepy go missing?
A4_10500_DORONCHS_500_3000	Draaak.
A4_10500_PIKACHU_500_6000	Inside the bamboo forest, huh.
A4_10500_DORONCHS_500_4000	Draaak!
A4_10500_PIKACHU_500_8000	Of course. We’ll let you know if we find Dreepy.
A4_10500_TIM_500_4000	Yeah, we will.
A4_1051_TIM_100_1000	If this gate weren’t locked, we could get into the\nbamboo forest through here.
A4_1051_PIKACHU_100_1000	Jessica must be somewhere in this area, then.
A4_10510_DORAMESHIYA_400_1000	Dreep...
A4_10510_PIKACHU_400_1000	Look, it’s the missing Dreepy!
A4_10510_DORAMESHIYA_400_2000	Dreep dreep!
A4_10510_PIKACHU_400_2000	You’re exploring the bamboo forest?
A4_10510_PIKACHU_400_3000	Exploration’s fun and all, but Drakloak’s been worried\nsick about you.
A4_10510_TIM_400_1000	Why don’t you take a break and check back in with\nDrakloak?
A4_10510_DORAMESHIYA_400_3000	Dreepy...?
A4_10510_PIKACHU_400_4000	You wanna go back, but you don’t know where\nDrakloak is?
A4_10510_TIM_400_2000	Oh, I guess it’s lost after all.
A4_10510_PIKACHU_400_5000	Drakloak is waiting for you back by the clearing\nnear the entrance to the forest.
A4_10510_DORAMESHIYA_400_4000	Dreep...
A4_10510_DORAMESHIYA_500_1000	Dreep.
A4_10510_PIKACHU_500_1000	It’s a Dreepy. What’re you up to?
A4_10510_DORAMESHIYA_500_2000	Dreep!
A4_10510_PIKACHU_500_2000	You’re exploring the bamboo forest? Well, have fun!
A4_10510_TIM_500_1000	Seems like an easygoing and carefree Pokémon...
A4_10520_TIM_100_1000	Will it find its way home OK?
A4_10520_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m worried too. Let’s follow it back.
A4_1060_CHARCOALDISCIPLE01_100_1000	Hey there! Here to do some sightseein’? Then have I\ngot the souvenir for you!
A4_1060_CHARCOALDISCIPLE01_100_2000	Our bamboo charcoal is made from only the finest\npieces of bamboo. Trust me—our quality is first class!
A4_1060_PIKACHU_100_1000	First class, eh? That’s a bold statement.
A4_1060_TIM_100_1000	We’d love to hear more about this neighborhood—\nand about bamboo charcoal, too, if you don’t mind.
A4_1060_CHARCOALDISCIPLE01_100_3000	No problem at all! Can’t tell you much about the\nneighborhood, I’m afraid, but I can talk your ear\noff about bamboo charcoal.
A4_1060_PIKACHU_100_2000	...I guess we may as well listen to his charcoal spiel.
A4_1060_CHARCOALDISCIPLE01_200_1000	Visit our shop for all your bamboo charcoal needs!
A4_1060_SEL_0_1000	About the bamboo charcoal...
A4_1060_SEL_0_2000	See anything unusual lately?
A4_1060_CHARCOALDISCIPLE01_300_1000	As I’m sure you’re well aware, Bamboo Borough is\nfamous for its bamboo. By harnessing that abundant\nnatural resource, bamboo charcoal was born!
A4_1060_CHARCOALDISCIPLE01_300_2000	Our bamboo charcoal is crafted by a charcoal master\nwith 60 years of experience! He pours his heart and\nsoul into every piece.
A4_1060_TIM_300_1000	Wow—60 years!
A4_1060_CHARCOALDISCIPLE01_300_3000	I know, right?! I’ve learned a ton by working with him.\nHe’s so dedicated to his craft! But I guess he’d have\nto be to do this for 80 years.
A4_1060_PIKACHU_300_1000	Yeah, 80 years is a long time to do anyth—wait,\nhold on.
A4_1060_PIKACHU_300_2000	Didn’t he JUST say 60 years?
A4_1060_CHARCOALDISCIPLE01_300_4000	I highly recommend our bamboo charcoal as a\nsouvenir!
A4_1060_TIM_400_1000	Have you noticed anything unusual in the\nneighborhood lately?
A4_1060_CHARCOALDISCIPLE01_400_1000	Huh. Strange question, stranger!
A4_1060_CHARCOALDISCIPLE01_400_2000	Nothin’ comes to mind though.
A4_1060_TIM_400_2000	I see. Well, thanks anyway.
A4_1060_PIKACHU_400_1000	Guess nothing strange has been going on.
A4_10600_WANPACHI_200_1000	Yaaamp...
A4_10600_PIKACHU_200_1000	Thanks for waiting, Yamper! Here’s that cheese you\nwanted so bad.
A4_10600_WANPACHI_200_2000	Yamp!
A4_10600_PIKACHU_200_2000	Easy there! There’s plenty of cheese—no need to\ngobble it up so fast...
A4_10600_WANPACHI_200_3000	Yamp yaaamp!
A4_10600_PIKACHU_200_3000	Whoa!
A4_10600_TIM_200_1000	Yamper scarfed it all down in one go!
A4_10600_WANPACHI_200_4000	Yamp!
A4_10600_PIKACHU_200_4000	You’ve never tasted cheese this delicious?
A4_10600_PIKACHU_200_5000	Glad to hear it. And I’m sure the pizzeria’s manager\nwould be thankful for the positive review.
A4_10600_WANPACHI_200_5000	Yamp!
A4_10600_PIKACHU_200_6000	You want MORE?! Don’t be so gluttonous!
A4_10600_WANPACHI_200_6000	Yamp yaaamp!
A4_10600_TIM_200_2000	It ran full sprint back to town...
A4_10600_PIKACHU_200_7000	I guess we’re done here, then?
A4_10600_WANPACHI_300_1000	Yaaamp...
A4_10600_PIKACHU_300_1000	Hang in there. We’ll go find some cheese for you\nin town.
A4_10600_WANPACHI_400_1000	Yamp...
A4_10600_PIKACHU_400_1000	This Yamper sounds a little low energy...
A4_10600_TIM_400_1000	Maybe it’s upset about something. Let’s ask!
A4_10600_PIKACHU_400_2000	Hey, Yamper. Something wrong?
A4_10600_WANPACHI_400_2000	Yamp yamp...
A4_10600_PIKACHU_400_3000	What? You’re so hungry you can’t move?
A4_10600_PIKACHU_400_4000	Then why not rustle up something to eat in the\nbamboo forest?
A4_10600_TIM_400_2000	Yeah, there’s plenty of food here.
A4_10600_WANPACHI_400_3000	Yamp...
A4_10600_PIKACHU_400_5000	Oh... You’re from the city, so the food here isn’t suited\nto your taste.
A4_10600_PIKACHU_400_6000	Kinda spoiled, huh.
A4_10600_TIM_400_3000	It probably lived a sheltered life in the city... Hmm,\nwhat should we do?
A4_10600_PIKACHU_400_7000	I guess we could go back to town and find something\nyou’d like...
A4_10600_WANPACHI_400_4000	Yaaamp...
A4_10600_PIKACHU_400_8000	You want some soft, melted cheese?
A4_10600_PIKACHU_400_9000	*sigh* You’re awful picky.
A4_10610_PIZZASTORE_200_1000	Yamper seems to really like me now.
A4_10610_PIZZASTORE_300_1000	I hope Yamper feels satisfied after eating that cheese.
A4_10610_PIZZASTORE_400_1000	Hey there! Welcome to Bamboo Borough Pizzeria!\nWhat can I get you?
A4_10610_TIM_400_1000	Oh, uh, I’m not actually here for pizza. But is there\nany chance I could just buy some cheese?
A4_10610_PIZZASTORE_400_2000	What an interesting request! Mind if I ask why?
A4_10610_TIM_400_2000	There’s a hungry Yamper in the bamboo forest.
A4_10610_TIM_400_3000	I thought it might like some cheese from your pizzeria.
A4_10610_PIZZASTORE_400_3000	Say no more! I’d love to help you out.
A4_10610_PIZZASTORE_400_4000	Here you go!
A4_10610_TIM_400_4000	Whoa, that’s a whole lot of cheese! Thank you!
A4_10610_PIZZASTORE_400_5000	Personally, I’d rather be serving it a piping-hot pizza\nfresh out of the oven.
A4_10610_PIZZASTORE_400_6000	But if cheese is what it craves, I’m happy to oblige!
A4_10610_PIKACHU_400_1000	Right on, Tim! Let’s take this to Yamper.
A4_10620_WANPACHI_100_1000	Yamp!
A4_10620_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, are you trying to get seconds?
A4_10620_PIKACHU_100_2000	It probably thinks it can get more cheese by hanging\naround here...
A4_1070_BAWOMANMID01_100_1000	Hi there! Can I interest you in some herbal medicine?\nPlease buy as much as you’d like!
A4_1070_TIM_100_1000	Interesting. What kind of medicine do you have?
A4_1070_BAWOMANMID01_100_2000	Oh, you know. All sorts.
A4_1070_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s...descriptive.
A4_1070_BAWOMANMID01_100_3000	I’m just looking after the shop while the owner’s\naway. I dunno what to tell you. Heh heh!
A4_1070_TIM_100_2000	I’m not sure that’s something to laugh about...
A4_1070_BAWOMANMID01_200_1000	Here for some medicine? Buy as much as you’d like!
A4_1070_SEL_0_1000	About the herbal medicine...
A4_1070_SEL_0_2000	See anything unusual lately?
A4_1070_BAWOMANMID01_300_1000	The owner’s quite enthusiastic about herbal medicine.\nHe’s always disappearing to go look for ingredients.
A4_1070_BAWOMANMID01_300_2000	He’ll pop out, then suddenly show up again with piles\nof roots and empty insect shells.
A4_1070_BAWOMANMID01_300_3000	When he couldn’t enter the bamboo forest a couple\nyears back, he ended up finding another good spot\nto collect ingredients.
A4_1070_BAWOMANMID01_300_4000	Turns out, that spot’s got different ingredients than\nthe bamboo forest! He’s been popping over there\never since.
A4_1070_PIKACHU_300_1000	You know, I thought the owner was being kinda\ncareless with his business at first, but it sounds like\nhe actually knows what he’s doing.
A4_1070_BAWOMANMID01_300_5000	This shop would go out of business without the\nowner’s hard work. I’m more than happy just to hold\ndown the fort! Haha!
A4_1070_PIKACHU_300_2000	They seem like a great pair.
A4_1070_TIM_400_1000	Have you noticed anything unusual in the\nneighborhood lately?
A4_1070_BAWOMANMID01_400_1000	Unusual, huh? Hmmm...
A4_1070_BAWOMANMID01_400_2000	Well, our supply of herbal medicine has gotten pretty\nlow, so I’ve been wondering whether it’ll last until the\nowner gets back.
A4_1070_TIM_400_2000	I see. I hope he comes back soon.
A4_1070_BAWOMANMID01_400_3000	Me too. It’d be a shame if he came back to a\nshuttered shop! Haha!
A4_1070_PIKACHU_400_1000	How is she so carefree?!
A4_1080_BKMANMID01_100_1000	Welcome! How about a souvenir to remember\nyour trip?
A4_1080_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oooh, I love souvenirs. Let’s take a look, Tim.
A4_1080_PIKACHU_100_2000	You never know—we might learn something useful.
A4_1080_BKMANMID01_100_2000	Hm? I feel like I’ve seen you somewhere...
A4_1080_PIKACHU_100_3000	You hear that, Tim? People recognize us here too!
A4_1080_BKMANMID01_100_3000	I got it! You two are detectives, right?
A4_1080_PIKACHU_100_4000	Close! I’m not just a detective, though—I’m a\nGREAT detective!
A4_1080_BKMANMID01_100_4000	I’ve got just the thing for a couple of sleuths.
A4_1080_TIM_100_3000	I’d love to take a look. Do you mind if I ask you a few\nquestions, too?
A4_1080_BKMANMID01_200_1000	Feel free to browse.
A4_1080_SEL_0_1000	About the souvenir shop...
A4_1080_SEL_0_2000	See anything unusual lately?
A4_1080_TIM_300_1000	Hey! Isn’t this hat...
A4_1080_PIKACHU_300_1000	It looks just like mine...
A4_1080_BKMANMID01_300_1000	Excellent choice! That detective hat is very popular\nwith kids.
A4_1080_PIKACHU_300_2000	Why don’t we get one for Sophia as a souvenir?
A4_1080_TIM_300_2000	I think it might be a bit small for her.
A4_1080_PIKACHU_300_3000	You’re probably right. Too bad!
A4_1080_TIM_400_1000	Have you noticed anything unusual in the\nneighborhood lately?
A4_1080_BKMANMID01_400_1000	Hmm... Well, I’ve been seeing some new faces\nrecently.
A4_1080_TIM_400_2000	Interesting. What sort of new faces, exactly?
A4_1080_BKMANMID01_400_2000	Why, hip youngsters like yourself, of course! I’ll bet\nthey heard about all the rare souvenirs we carry. You\ncan’t find goods like these in the city, you know!
A4_1080_PIKACHU_400_1000	Heh. He’s a dedicated salesman.
A4_1080_TIM_400_3000	No kidding. Seems like no one suspicious has come\nby at least.
A4_10800_ANYARTH_200_1000	Meow?
A4_10800_PIKACHU_200_1000	Hmph. Would it kill you to be a little nicer?
A4_10800_ANYARTH_300_1000	Meow!
A4_10800_PIKACHU_300_1000	You don’t need anything more from us, so we’re\ndismissed?
A4_10800_PIKACHU_300_2000	Wow, could you BE any more entitled?!
A4_10800_TIM_300_1000	There, there. Let’s head over to the ceramics shop\nand ask someone there about the brooch.
A4_10800_ANYARTH_400_1000	Meow!
A4_10800_PIKACHU_400_1000	Here you go! This is the brooch you were looking for,\nisn’t it?
A4_10800_ANYARTH_400_2000	Meow!
A4_10800_PIKACHU_400_2000	Careful not to lose it again.
A4_10800_ANYARTH_400_3000	Meooow.
A4_10800_PIKACHU_400_3000	“That will be all”? That’s it? Not even a thank-you?
A4_10800_TIM_400_1000	It really is prideful...
A4_10800_TIM_400_2000	Come to think of it, why did Meowth even have a\nbrooch to begin with?
A4_10800_PIKACHU_400_4000	Don’t tell me it was stolen from the ceramics shop...
A4_10800_ANYARTH_400_4000	Meooow!
A4_10800_PIKACHU_400_5000	None of our business, it says.
A4_10800_TIM_400_3000	I don’t think we’ll get a straight answer from it.
A4_10800_TIM_400_4000	Let’s try asking someone who works there.
A4_10800_ANYARTH_500_1000	Meooowth!
A4_10800_PIKACHU_500_1000	Your brooch, huh... Let’s look for it in the bamboo\nforest.
A4_10800_TIM_500_1000	It’s very shiny, right?
A4_10800_ANYARTH_600_1000	Meooowth?
A4_10800_TIM_600_1000	Is this a Meowth? It looks a little...different.
A4_10800_PIKACHU_600_1000	It’s an Alolan Meowth. You don’t see one of them\nevery day.
A4_10800_PIKACHU_600_2000	Supposedly, they’re prideful and crafty.
A4_10800_ANYARTH_600_2000	Meow meow. Meowth!
A4_10800_PIKACHU_600_3000	Oh, my bad. Didn’t mean to offend.
A4_10800_ANYARTH_600_3000	Meow.
A4_10800_PIKACHU_600_4000	What’s that? There’s something you need help with?
A4_10800_ANYARTH_600_4000	Meowth. Meow meow!
A4_10800_PIKACHU_600_5000	It says it lost its brooch while playing in the bamboo\nforest.
A4_10800_PIKACHU_600_6000	And it’s demanding that we go look for it.
A4_10800_PIKACHU_600_7000	Hey, we don’t have time for that! Go look for it\nyourself.
A4_10800_ANYARTH_600_5000	Meow! Meowwwth!
A4_10800_PIKACHU_600_8000	It’s saying the bamboo forest feels off today.
A4_10800_PIKACHU_600_9000	So it doesn’t wanna go in there.
A4_10800_PIKACHU_600_10000	That’s your problem, not ours!
A4_10800_TIM_600_2000	Hey now, let’s try to help it.
A4_10800_TIM_600_3000	How about we look for the brooch if we have some\nspare time?
A4_10800_PIKACHU_600_11000	*sigh* I guess that’s fine.
A4_10800_ANYARTH_600_6000	Meooow!
A4_10800_PIKACHU_600_12000	The brooch is apparently real shiny. If we see anything\nthat matches that description, let’s get a closer look.
A4_10810_TIM_100_1000	Hm? I think I just saw something sparkle...
A4_10810_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh yeah? Lemme see...
A4_10810_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh, what a pretty brooch. Maybe it’s the one Meowth\nwas looking for?
A4_10810_TIM_100_2000	It has to be! Let’s bring it over when we get a chance!
A4_10820_BHWOMANOLD01_200_1000	Meowth can be a little snooty at times, but that’s just\none more thing I find endearing about him.
A4_10820_BHWOMANOLD01_300_1000	Hi there. Are you looking for anything in particular?
A4_10820_TIM_300_1000	Not really. Actually, I wanted to ask you about that\nMeowth over there.
A4_10820_TIM_300_2000	Do you know anything about that pretty brooch it\nalways has?
A4_10820_BHWOMANOLD01_300_2000	Oh, that? I gave it to him as a gift.
A4_10820_TIM_300_3000	A gift? Oh, wait, are you Meowth’s partner?
A4_10820_BHWOMANOLD01_300_3000	Yes, I am.
A4_10820_BHWOMANOLD01_300_4000	I’ve traveled all over the world buying pieces to sell\nin my shop.
A4_10820_BHWOMANOLD01_300_5000	I met Meowth during my travels in the Alola region.
A4_10820_BHWOMANOLD01_300_6000	He seemed quite enamored by the brooch I was\nwearing at the time.
A4_10820_BHWOMANOLD01_300_7000	We ended up growing thick as thieves and decided\nto live together.
A4_10820_PIKACHU_300_1000	That explains what an Alolan Pokémon is doing here.\nYou don’t see much of ’em in this neck of the woods.
A4_10820_BHWOMANOLD01_300_8000	He may seem a little standoffish, but he’s actually\nquite kind. He even helps out around the shop.
A4_10820_TIM_300_4000	Really? How nice of him.
A4_10820_PIKACHU_300_2000	I can’t imagine that Meowth lifting a paw to help\nanyone...
A4_10820_TIM_300_5000	That just goes to show how special the bond is\nbetween Pokémon and their partners.
A4_10820_BHWOMANOLD01_300_9000	He’s treasured that brooch since the day we met.
A4_10820_BHWOMANOLD01_300_10000	Ah, that reminds me! I haven’t seen him with it in\nquite a while.
A4_10820_BHWOMANOLD01_300_11000	Oh dear—I hope he hasn’t lost it!
A4_10820_TIM_300_6000	We actually found his brooch in the bamboo forest\nand gave it back to him.
A4_10820_BHWOMANOLD01_300_12000	Is that so? He must be thrilled that you found it!
A4_10820_BHWOMANOLD01_300_13000	He’s shy and has trouble showing his appreciation,\nso allow me to express my gratitude on his behalf!
A4_10820_BHWOMANOLD01_300_14000	Thank you for your help.
A4_10820_PIKACHU_300_3000	Who would’ve guessed that Meowth had such a kind\npartner? He’s lucky to have her.
A4_10820_BHWOMANOLD01_400_1000	I’ve got all sorts of ceramics from around the world.\nFeel free to take a look.
A4_10900_GNYARTH_200_1000	Meowth! Meow meooow!
A4_10900_TIM_200_1000	It’s really pumped up!
A4_10900_PIKACHU_200_1000	Probably fired up for its final battle before leaving\nthe bamboo forest.
A4_10900_GNYARTH_200_2000	Meow. Meowth!
A4_10900_PIKACHU_200_2000	Says it’s gonna win and brag about it to Darmanitan\nand the others.
A4_10900_TIM_200_2000	Be careful not to hurt yourself.
A4_10900_GNYARTH_300_1000	Meowth!
A4_10900_TIM_300_1000	This...is a Meowth, right?
A4_10900_PIKACHU_300_1000	Yeah, it’s a Steel-type Meowth.
A4_10900_PIKACHU_300_2000	I take it you’re not from around these parts, Meowth.\nWhere’d you come from, buddy?
A4_10900_GNYARTH_300_2000	Meow!
A4_10900_PIKACHU_300_3000	What?! You’re friends with Darmanitan and Eiscue?
A4_10900_TIM_300_2000	You mean the Darmanitan and Eiscue from the ruins?
A4_10900_PIKACHU_300_4000	What’re you doing here all by yourself?
A4_10900_GNYARTH_300_3000	Meowth...
A4_10900_PIKACHU_300_5000	So your friends got captured and you followed them,\nonly to lose track of them along the way...
A4_10900_GNYARTH_300_4000	Meow! Meow meow. Meow!
A4_10900_PIKACHU_300_6000	You like it here ’cause Jessica feeds you?
A4_10900_PIKACHU_300_7000	And there are others you can test your strength\nagainst?
A4_10900_PIKACHU_300_8000	Your hobbies are eating and battling, huh.
A4_10900_TIM_300_3000	I hope we can help this Meowth see Darmanitan and\nits friends.
A4_10900_PIKACHU_300_9000	They should still be at the southern ruins with Gordon.
A4_10900_PIKACHU_300_10000	You must wanna see Darmanitan and the gang, huh,\nMeowth?
A4_10900_GNYARTH_300_5000	Meowth!
A4_10900_PIKACHU_300_11000	You do, eh? Then lemme tell you how to get to the\nsouthern ruins.
A4_10900_GNYARTH_300_6000	Meow meow.
A4_10900_PIKACHU_300_12000	You don’t wanna go until you’ve battled and defeated\nthe strongest Pokémon in the bamboo forest?
A4_10900_GNYARTH_300_7000	Meowth! Meow meow. Meowwwth!
A4_10900_PIKACHU_300_13000	But you haven’t won yet, so you wanna beat that\nPokémon before you leave...
A4_10900_TIM_300_4000	Let’s be careful, Pikachu. Sounds like there’s a really\nstrong Pokémon out there...
A4_11000_KUWAGANNON_400_1000	Vikaaa...
A4_11000_PIKACHU_400_1000	Don’t cause too much trouble for your partner!
A4_11000_KUWAGANNON_500_1000	Vika!
A4_11000_PIKACHU_500_1000	It’s no use. Now’s not a good time to chat.
A4_11000_KUWAGANNON_600_1000	Vika vika!
A4_11000_PIKACHU_600_1000	It looks really angry!
A4_11010_HERACROS_400_1000	Heraaa...
A4_11010_PIKACHU_400_1000	It’s feeling a lot better after Sylveon came to help.
A4_11010_TIM_400_1000	Considering how angry Heracross was just a moment\nago, Sylveon is amazing!
A4_11010_HERACROS_500_1000	Hera!
A4_11010_PIKACHU_500_1000	Getting too close to it now would be dangerous...
A4_11010_HERACROS_600_1000	Heracross!
A4_11010_TIM_600_1000	It looks threatening! Let’s stay out of its way.
A4_11020_NYMPHIA_400_1000	Sylveooon!
A4_11020_PIKACHU_400_1000	She likes Bamboo Borough because of its kind people\nand Pokémon.
A4_11020_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’m sure this neighborhood will stay that way as long\nas you’re here!
A4_11020_NYMPHIA_500_1000	Syl!
A4_11020_BAGIRL01_500_1000	Do you need something from my Sylveon?
A4_11020_TIM_500_1000	Sylveon?
A4_11020_NYMPHIA_500_2000	Syl!
A4_11020_PIKACHU_500_1000	That’s it—a Sylveon!
A4_11020_TIM_500_2000	What’s up, Pikachu?
A4_11020_PIKACHU_500_2000	Sylveon can project a calming aura!
A4_11020_PIKACHU_500_3000	She should be able to break up Vikavolt and\nHeracross’s fight!
A4_11020_TIM_500_3000	Really? Let’s ask, then!
A4_11020_TIM_500_4000	Would it be all right if your Sylveon helped us out?
A4_11020_TIM_500_5000	Some Pokémon over there are about to start fighting.
A4_11020_BAGIRL01_500_2000	Sure! Do you think you can help with that, Sylveon?
A4_11020_NYMPHIA_500_3000	Sylveooon!
A4_11020_PIKACHU_500_4000	“Leave it to me,” she says.
A4_11020_BAGIRL01_500_3000	I think she’s saying she’ll help!
A4_11020_PIKACHU_500_5000	All right! Let’s hurry back to those two Pokémon!
A4_11020_NYMPHIA_600_1000	Syl...
A4_11020_PIKACHU_600_1000	You’re feeling uneasy? I dunno how to respond\nto that...
A4_11030_BAWOMANOLD02_200_1000	My partner and I were about to cause major trouble\nfor everyone!
A4_11030_BAWOMANOLD02_200_2000	I have to be more careful next time.
A4_11030_BAWOMANOLD02_300_1000	Oh, you two! Please help! They can’t hold back any\nlonger!
A4_11030_HERACROS_300_1000	Heracross!
A4_11030_KUWAGANNON_300_1000	Vika!!!
A4_11030_PIKACHU_300_1000	Looks like we made it just in time. Work your magic,\nSylveon!
A4_11030_NYMPHIA_300_1000	Syl!
A4_11030_HERACROS_300_2000	Heraaa...
A4_11030_KUWAGANNON_300_2000	Vikaaa...
A4_11030_BAWOMANOLD02_300_2000	Wow! That Heracross and my Vikavolt have calmed\ndown!
A4_11030_BAGIRL01_300_1000	Hehe! Sylveon can make everyone feel warm\nand happy.
A4_11030_TIM_300_1000	I’d say it worked!
A4_11030_PIKACHU_300_3000	Yeaaah... It reaaally diiid...
A4_11030_TIM_300_2000	Hey, keep it together!
A4_11030_BAWOMANOLD02_300_3000	So you’re the ones who asked that girl for help.
A4_11030_BAWOMANOLD02_300_4000	You saved the day. Thank you!
A4_11030_TIM_300_3000	Oh no, Sylveon and her partner deserve all the credit.
A4_11030_BAGIRL01_300_2000	Isn’t my Sylveon amazing?
A4_11030_NYMPHIA_300_2000	Sylveooon!
A4_11030_TIM_300_4000	Yeah, you both did an incredible job! Thank you\nso much.
A4_11030_TIM_300_5000	Seems like our work here is done.
A4_11030_PIKACHU_300_4000	No more fighting—all right, you two?
A4_11030_KUWAGANNON_300_3000	Vikaaa...
A4_11030_HERACROS_300_3000	Heraaa...
A4_11030_BAWOMANOLD02_400_1000	My Vikavolt is about to start fighting Heracross any\nminute now.
A4_11030_BAWOMANOLD02_400_2000	I wonder if there’s a Pokémon that can calm\nthem down...
A4_11030_BAWOMANOLD02_500_1000	What do I do? He won’t listen to me at all...
A4_11030_PIKACHU_500_1000	Seems like something’s up.
A4_11030_TIM_500_1000	Is anything wrong?
A4_11030_BAWOMANOLD02_500_2000	As you can see, my Vikavolt is about to start a fight\nwith Heracross!
A4_11030_KUWAGANNON_600_1000	Vika vika!
A4_11030_HERACROS_800_1000	Heraaa!
A4_11030_TIM_800_1000	You’re right. A fight’s about to break out at any\nmoment!
A4_11030_PIKACHU_800_1000	Actually, I’ve heard that these two Pokémon have a\nhistory of being rivals.
A4_11030_BAWOMANOLD02_800_1000	I was on a walk with Vikavolt.
A4_11030_BAWOMANOLD02_800_2000	And then he bumped into Heracross.
A4_11030_PIKACHU_800_2000	And that’s when he lost his temper, huh.
A4_11030_TIM_800_2000	I wonder if there’s some way we could stop them...
A4_11030_PIKACHU_800_3000	They’re powerful Pokémon, so it’d be tough to stop\n’em with brute force.
A4_11030_PIKACHU_800_4000	Let’s find a Pokémon that could help them\ncalm down.
A4_11040_BAGIRL01_200_1000	My Sylveon is amazing!
A4_11040_BAGIRL01_300_1000	Do you need something from my Sylveon?
A4_11040_TIM_300_1000	Sylveon?
A4_11040_BAGIRL01_600_1000	My Sylveon is uneasy about something.
A4_11040_NYMPHIA_400_1000	Syl!
A4_11040_PIKACHU_400_1000	That’s it—a Sylveon!
A4_11040_TIM_400_1000	What’s up, Pikachu?
A4_11040_PIKACHU_400_2000	Sylveon can project a calming aura!
A4_11040_PIKACHU_400_3000	She should be able to break up Vikavolt and\nHeracross’s fight!
A4_11040_TIM_400_2000	Really? Let’s ask, then!
A4_11040_TIM_400_3000	Would it be all right if your Sylveon helped us out?
A4_11040_TIM_400_4000	Some Pokémon over there are about to start fighting.
A4_11040_BAGIRL01_400_1000	Sure! Do you think you can help with that, Sylveon?
A4_11040_NYMPHIA_400_2000	Sylveooon!
A4_11040_PIKACHU_400_4000	“Leave it to me,” she says.
A4_11040_BAGIRL01_400_2000	I think she’s saying she’ll help!
A4_11040_PIKACHU_400_5000	All right! Let’s hurry on over to the two Pokémon!
A4_11100_MIMIKKYU_200_1000	Kyu!
A4_11100_TIM_200_1000	With its disguise fixed, it looks just like you, Pikachu.
A4_11100_PIKACHU_200_1000	Seriously? You don’t think I’m cuter and cooler than\nthis? Not even a little?
A4_11100_TIM_300_1000	Thanks for waiting, Mimikyu! Would this mirror work\nfor you?
A4_11100_MIMIKKYUB_300_1000	Kyu kyu!
A4_11100_PIKACHU_300_1000	Like a charm, it says!
A4_11100_MIMIKKYUB_300_2000	Kyu kyuuu...
A4_11100_PIKACHU_300_2000	But...it’s too embarrassed to fix its disguise in front\nof us.
A4_11100_TIM_300_2000	Then we’ll turn around and keep our backs to you.\nJust let us know when you’re done.
A4_11100_MIMIKKYUB_300_3000	Kyu!
A4_11100_MIMIKKYUB_400_1000	Kyu kyu...
A4_11100_PIKACHU_400_1000	Cheer up. We’ll be back with a mirror for you ASAP!
A4_11100_TIM_400_1000	I hope we can find one around Bamboo Borough...
A4_11100_MIMIKKYUB_500_1000	Kyu kyu...
A4_11100_PIKACHU_500_1000	What’s got you looking so down in the dumps? You\ntake a Toxic to the face or something?
A4_11100_TIM_500_1000	Is something wrong with it?
A4_11100_MIMIKKYUB_500_2000	Kyu... Kyu kyu...
A4_11100_PIKACHU_500_2000	It was taking a walk around the storage area at the\nfar end of the bamboo forest...
A4_11100_PIKACHU_500_3000	Then suddenly, an unfamiliar Pokémon rushed out\nand tried to attack it.
A4_11100_TIM_500_2000	Oh, man. Is it OK?
A4_11100_PIKACHU_500_4000	It escaped right away, so it wasn’t hurt...
A4_11100_PIKACHU_500_5000	But its disguise got busted.
A4_11100_MIMIKKYUB_500_3000	Kyu kyu...
A4_11100_PIKACHU_500_6000	Unfortunately, its disguise is super difficult to fix,\nand that’s why it’s feeling so crestfallen.
A4_11100_TIM_500_3000	That’s so sad. Is there anything we can do to help?
A4_11100_MIMIKKYUB_500_4000	Kyu!
A4_11100_PIKACHU_500_7000	It says a mirror would help.
A4_11100_TIM_500_4000	OK. We’ll go look for a mirror, so just wait right here!
A4_11110_BKMANMID01_200_1000	Don’t worry about returning the mirror—I’ll retrieve it\nmyself after all is said and done.
A4_11110_TIM_200_1000	Sorry for the hassle.
A4_11110_BKMANMID01_200_2000	It’s no problem at all. Folks should look out for\neach other.
A4_11110_BKMANMID01_300_1000	Welcome! How about a souvenir to remember\nyour trip?
A4_11110_TIM_300_1000	Actually, uh, you happen to have any mirrors?
A4_11110_TIM_300_2000	Preferably a full-length one, if possible.
A4_11110_BKMANMID01_300_2000	We have some hand mirrors, but nothing full length...
A4_11110_TIM_300_3000	Oh... Thanks anyway.
A4_11110_TIM_300_4000	It’s a real shame, though... I was really hoping to help\nMimikyu with its disguise...
A4_11110_BKMANMID01_300_3000	Mimikyu, you say?
A4_11110_BKMANMID01_300_4000	If you don’t mind, may I ask why you’re looking for\na mirror?
A4_11110_TIM_300_5000	Well, you see...
A4_11110_BKMANMID01_300_5000	...Ah. Now I understand the situation.
A4_11110_BKMANMID01_300_6000	Feel free to borrow the shop’s display mirror.
A4_11110_TIM_300_6000	Are you sure that’s all right?
A4_11110_BKMANMID01_300_7000	Certainly. I’ll ask Mimikyu for it back later.
A4_11110_TIM_300_7000	Thank you!
A4_11110_PIKACHU_300_1000	Let’s take it to Mimikyu right away!
A4_11120_MIMIKKYU_100_1000	Kyu kyu!
A4_11120_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, it looks all fixed up!
A4_11120_TIM_100_1000	I’m glad you’re OK now, Mimikyu!
A4_11120_MIMIKKYU_100_2000	Kyuuu!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_200_1000	I’ll be cheering you on in all your future endeavors!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_200_2000	But if you ever change your mind, let me know!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_300_1000	Hi, Detective! Are you ready to give me an answer?
A4_11200_TIM_300_1000	Yeah. The answer’s Grovyle.
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_300_2000	Heh, typical detective! That’s correct!
A4_11200_DODEKABASHI_300_1000	Canno!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_300_3000	Grovyle can leap into motion instantaneously.
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_300_4000	It leaps from stalk to stalk in the bamboo forest until\nit spots prey—then Grovyle leaps right at it!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_300_5000	That’s how Grovyle battles—by using its environment\nto its advantage.
A4_11200_TIM_300_2000	Sounds like the last Pokémon you’d want for an\nenemy in a place like the bamboo forest.
A4_11200_PIKACHU_300_1000	The Grovyle we saw here seemed very kind, though.
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_300_6000	Well, that’s the end of our fun quiz sessions...
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_300_7000	But it would be a shame if you didn’t continue putting\nyour sharp eye for detail to good use!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_300_8000	Do you want to research Pokémon with me full time?\nWhaddya say?!
A4_11200_TIM_300_3000	I’m flattered, but...
A4_11200_TIM_300_4000	I’ve already got my hands full with my detective work.
A4_11200_PIKACHU_300_2000	And I don’t know how I feel about quizzing strangers\non the street...
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_300_9000	That’s a shame. Well, I hope to see you around\nanyway!
A4_11200_DODEKABASHI_300_2000	Canno!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_400_1000	What agile Pokémon has leaves growing on its arms\nand head?
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_400_2000	Let me know when you find it!
A4_11200_DODEKABASHI_400_1000	Canno.
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_500_1000	So, Detective, have you figured out the answer?
A4_11200_TIM_500_1000	Yes. It’s Noctowl, isn’t it?
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_500_2000	Correct! With your sharp eye for detail, it’s no surprise\nyou got that right!
A4_11200_DODEKABASHI_500_1000	Canno!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_500_3000	Noctowl can see in the dark as long as there’s the\ntiniest amount of light.
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_500_4000	It uses that keen eyesight to sneak up on its prey\nfrom above. Once Noctowl’s got a target, there’s\nno escape!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_500_5000	Take care not to do anything suspicious, or else it\nmight peck at you!
A4_11200_TIM_500_2000	OK, we’ll be careful.
A4_11200_PIKACHU_500_1000	Getting pecked by that sharp beak is definitely at the\nbottom of my to-do list...
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_500_6000	Now, it’s the final stretch! Here’s your last question!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_500_7000	What agile Pokémon has leaves growing on its arms\nand head?
A4_11200_DODEKABASHI_500_2000	Caaanno!
A4_11200_TIM_500_3000	Based on that description, I’d bet it’s a Pokémon\nliving in the bamboo forest.
A4_11200_PIKACHU_500_2000	Yeah, maybe its body is green too. Better keep your\neyes peeled, Tim.
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_500_8000	Let me know when you find it!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_600_1000	What sharp-eyed Pokémon keeps watch from above\nfor anyone suspicious?
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_600_2000	The Pokémon in question might not be on this street!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_600_3000	Let me know when you find the answer!
A4_11200_DODEKABASHI_600_1000	Canno.
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_700_1000	Why hello, Detective. Have you figured out the\nanswer?
A4_11200_TIM_700_1000	Yes. It’s Deino, right?
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_700_2000	That’s right! Bravo!
A4_11200_DODEKABASHI_700_1000	Cannooo!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_700_3000	Deino can’t see, so they navigate their surroundings\nby biting everything.
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_700_4000	Don’t get too close to it, or you’ll get bit!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_700_5000	They pretty much eat everything, but they’ll remember\nwhen something’s especially tasty.
A4_11200_PIKACHU_700_1000	No wonder it hangs out near the restaurants. The\npizza and curry there are delicious!
A4_11200_TIM_700_2000	I just hope it doesn’t get into trouble if it bites a\nPokémon...
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_700_6000	On to question number two!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_700_7000	What sharp-eyed Pokémon keeps watch from above\nfor anyone suspicious?
A4_11200_DODEKABASHI_700_2000	Caaanno!
A4_11200_TIM_700_3000	It must have distinctive eyes.
A4_11200_PIKACHU_700_2000	I don’t think I saw any Pokémon with sharp eyes\naround here.
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_700_8000	The Pokémon in question might not be on this street!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_700_9000	Let me know when you find the answer!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_800_1000	What Pokémon bites and eats anything it\ncomes across?
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_800_2000	Let me know when you figure out which Pokémon it is!
A4_11200_DODEKABASHI_800_1000	Canno.
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_900_1000	Oh hi, Detective! What a coincidence seeing\nyou here!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_900_2000	You weren’t by chance following me, were you?
A4_11200_DODEKABASHI_900_1000	Caaanno!
A4_11200_PIKACHU_900_1000	I-it’s the quiz professor... She came all the way here?
A4_11200_TIM_900_1000	Um, no, we didn’t follow you... We just had something\nimportant to do here.
A4_11200_TIM_900_2000	But now that we HAVE run into each other, does that\nmean...
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_900_3000	Yep, that’s right! There’s only one thing for us to do!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_900_4000	I’ve been here a few times for my research, but it’s\nalways exciting! There are all kinds of Pokémon here!
A4_11200_PIKACHU_900_2000	*sigh* I don’t see any way out of this...
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_900_5000	OK, here’s question number one!
A4_11200_DODEKABASHI_900_2000	Canno!
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_900_6000	What Pokémon bites and eats anything it\ncomes across?
A4_11200_TIM_900_3000	Eats anything it comes across, huh...
A4_11200_TIM_900_4000	Maybe we can find it hanging out somewhere that\nhas food.
A4_11200_PIKACHU_900_3000	Great idea! Let’s go see.
A4_11200_WOMANQUIZ_900_7000	OK, let me know when you figure out which Pokémon\nit is!
A4_11210_MONOZU_400_1000	Deinooo.
A4_11210_PIKACHU_400_1000	Careful, Tim. It’ll bite anything that moves.
A4_11210_MONOZU_400_2000	Deinooo...
A4_11210_PIKACHU_400_2000	D-don’t try to eat me, all right?!
A4_11210_MONOZU_500_1000	Deinooo!
A4_11210_TIM_500_1000	Hey, Pikachu, this Pokémon keeps biting everything\naround it.
A4_11210_PIKACHU_500_2000	Then it’s gotta be a Deino. It bites anything that\nmoves, so be careful.
A4_11210_MONOZU_500_2000	Deinooo!
A4_11210_PIKACHU_500_3000	It says it likes to eat all the food the tourists drop.
A4_11210_TIM_500_2000	Haha... That’s quite an appetite.
A4_11210_PIKACHU_500_4000	Which means...
A4_11210_TIM_500_3000	...It must be the answer to the quiz professor’s\nquestion!
A4_11210_PIKACHU_500_5000	Yeah! Let’s go tell her.
A4_11210_MONOZU_600_1000	Deino!
A4_11210_TIM_600_1000	This Pokémon is hanging out near the restaurants.
A4_11220_YORUNOZUKU_400_1000	Noctooowl.
A4_11220_PIKACHU_400_1000	Apparently there’s been a lot of commotion today.
A4_11220_YORUNOZUKU_500_1000	Noct!
A4_11220_PIKACHU_500_1000	This Pokémon is perched up there, watching over the\nbamboo forest.
A4_11220_TIM_500_1000	As if it’s keeping an eye out for anything dangerous.
A4_11220_YORUNOZUKU_500_2000	Noct noct!
A4_11220_PIKACHU_500_2000	We both CLEARLY look suspicious, or so it says...
A4_11220_TIM_500_2000	What?! We’re just trying to conduct an investigation.
A4_11220_YORUNOZUKU_500_3000	Noct?
A4_11220_PIKACHU_500_3000	Ah, that explains it—a while back, an unfamiliar\nPokémon went berserk around here.
A4_11220_PIKACHU_500_4000	Since then, it’s been trying to alert everyone to any\npotential dangers it sees.
A4_11220_TIM_500_3000	A dangerous Pokémon, huh... We should be careful\nourselves.
A4_11220_YORUNOZUKU_500_4000	Noctooowl!
A4_11220_PIKACHU_500_5000	Oh yeah! Tim, is this the Pokémon the quiz professor\nwas talking about?
A4_11220_TIM_500_4000	Yeah, it’s a perfect match!
A4_11220_TIM_500_5000	OK, let’s give our answer next time we see her.
A4_11220_YORUNOZUKU_600_1000	Noct noct!
A4_11220_TIM_600_1000	This Pokémon keeps staring at us.
A4_11220_PIKACHU_600_1000	Like it’s on the lookout for suspicious activity...
A4_11230_JUPTILE_400_1000	Grov!
A4_11230_PIKACHU_400_1000	You and me both, pal—if trouble comes a-knockin’,\nI’ll be right there to answer.
A4_11230_JUPTILE_500_1000	Grov!
A4_11230_PIKACHU_500_1000	Hm? What’s...?
A4_11230_JUPTILE_500_2000	Grrrov?
A4_11230_PIKACHU_500_2000	You came out onto this path ’cause you heard\nsome noise?
A4_11230_PIKACHU_500_3000	What are you doing here?
A4_11230_JUPTILE_500_3000	Grov!
A4_11230_PIKACHU_500_4000	Apparently it’s patrolling the bamboo forest to\nprotect the weaker Pokémon.
A4_11230_TIM_500_1000	Sounds like it has a strong sense of responsibility.
A4_11230_JUPTILE_500_4000	Grrrov!
A4_11230_PIKACHU_500_5000	It’s got a feeling something bad is gonna happen\ntoday.
A4_11230_TIM_500_2000	What? You don’t really think...
A4_11230_PIKACHU_500_6000	Maybe it’s the kinda instinct only wild Pokémon have.
A4_11230_JUPTILE_500_5000	Grov!
A4_11230_PIKACHU_500_7000	If something DOES happen, I’m glad you’re here to\ntake care of the Pokémon!
A4_11230_TIM_500_3000	Say, remember the Pokémon from the quiz professor’s\nquestion? The agile one that has leaves growing on its\narms and head?
A4_11230_TIM_500_4000	Do you think she might have been talking\nabout Grovyle?
A4_11230_PIKACHU_500_8000	Yeah, you’re right. OK, let’s go tell her!
A4_11230_JUPTILE_600_1000	Grrrov?
A4_11230_TIM_600_1000	It keeps looking around the bamboo forest... Maybe\nit’s on patrol?
A4_11300_KOMATANA_200_1000	Pawn...
A4_11300_PIKACHU_200_1000	It’s eager to find out who cut this bamboo.
A4_11300_TIM_200_1000	This is some serious business for Pawniard!
A4_11300_KOMATANA_300_1000	Pawn...
A4_11300_TIM_300_1000	Hey, don’t we know this Pawniard...?
A4_11300_PIKACHU_300_1000	It’s the Pawniard we met while we were working on\nthe stolen jewel case!
A4_11300_PIKACHU_300_2000	What’re you doing out here of all places?
A4_11300_KOMATANA_300_2000	Pawn!
A4_11300_PIKACHU_300_3000	Your journey to warriorhood led you all the\nway here?
A4_11300_KOMATANA_300_3000	Pawn!
A4_11300_PIKACHU_300_4000	And more importantly, you want us to look at this?\nJust looks like a cut-up stalk of bamboo to me...
A4_11300_KOMATANA_300_4000	Paaawn!
A4_11300_TIM_300_2000	Whoa! It suddenly got really angry!
A4_11300_PIKACHU_300_5000	“Fool! The sharpness of the cross-section, the beauty\nof the cut... None but a master of the blade could\nhave accomplished such a feat!
A4_11300_PIKACHU_300_6000	“And only a warrior would be able to appreciate it,”\nPawniard says.
A4_11300_TIM_300_3000	I guess it takes a real connoisseur to recognize when\nsomething’s done masterfully.
A4_11300_KOMATANA_300_5000	Pawn!
A4_11300_PIKACHU_300_7000	It thinks a Pokémon must’ve cut it with a move.
A4_11300_PIKACHU_300_8000	“Bring to me the slicer of bamboo,” it says.
A4_11300_KOMATANA_300_6000	Pawn!
A4_11300_PIKACHU_300_9000	And it’s serious about this request—deadly serious...
A4_11300_TIM_300_4000	If it’s that important to Pawniard, let’s help it out.
A4_11300_PIKACHU_300_10000	Yeah. After all, our meeting here again must mean\nsomething, right?
A4_11300_PIKACHU_300_11000	Hang tight, Pawniard! We’ll find that Pokémon\nfor you!
A4_11300_KOMATANA_300_7000	Paaawn!
A4_11310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_400_1000	Fetch’d!
A4_11310_TIM_400_1000	That leek is so long it almost looks like a sword!
A4_11310_PIKACHU_400_1000	That’s right! Sirfetch’d use ’em in battle as weapons.
A4_11310_PIKACHU_400_2000	Which can only mean one thing!
A4_11310_PIKACHU_400_3000	Hey, Sirfetch’d! You been cuttin’ up any bamboo\naround here recently?
A4_11310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_400_2000	Fetch’d!
A4_11310_PIKACHU_400_4000	You’ve sliced a few stalks as part of your training?\nI knew it!
A4_11310_TIM_400_2000	So Sirfetch’d is the Pokémon that Pawniard’s been\nlooking for!
A4_11310_PIKACHU_400_5000	Now that we know, we better tell Pawniard pronto!
A4_11310_KOMATANA_400_1000	Pawn!
A4_11310_PIKACHU_400_6000	Pawniard says, “This one’s aura has a warrior’s edge...\nAt last I have found the slicer of bamboo.”
A4_11310_TIM_400_3000	I’m glad we were able to find it!
A4_11310_KOMATANA_400_2000	Pawn!
A4_11310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_400_3000	Fetch’d?
A4_11310_KOMATANA_400_3000	Paaawn!
A4_11310_TIM_400_4000	What are they talking about?
A4_11310_PIKACHU_400_7000	Pawniard wants to further hone its skills by becoming\nSirfetch’d’s apprentice.
A4_11310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_400_4000	Sir.
A4_11310_PIKACHU_400_8000	Sirfetch’d says, “Alas! I cannot take you under my\nwing, for I am not yet a full-fledged knight myself.”
A4_11310_PIKACHU_400_9000	“Nevertheless! ’Twould be an honor to hone our skills\ntogether as fellow warriors in training.”
A4_11310_KOMATANA_400_4000	Pawn!
A4_11310_PIKACHU_400_10000	Sounds like they were able to come to an agreement.
A4_11310_KOMATANA_400_5000	Paaawn!
A4_11310_PIKACHU_400_11000	Apparently Pawniard and Sirfetch’d are gonna head\nout on the path of the warrior together.
A4_11310_PIKACHU_400_12000	It’s thanking us for introducing them to each other.
A4_11310_TIM_400_5000	No trouble at all. Good luck to you both!
A4_11310_KOMATANA_400_6000	Paaawn!
A4_11310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_400_5000	Fetch’d!
A4_11310_PIKACHU_400_13000	Off they go...
A4_11310_TIM_400_6000	I hope they can become the skilled Pokémon they’ve\nalways wanted to be!
A4_11310_PIKACHU_400_14000	Yeah.
A4_11310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_500_1000	Fetch’d!
A4_11310_TIM_500_1000	Wow, that’s quite a long plant this Pokémon is\nholding!
A4_11310_PIKACHU_500_1000	That’s a Sirfetch’d. It battles using its leek as a sword\nand the leaf as a shield.
A4_11310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_500_2000	Fetch’d!
A4_11310_PIKACHU_500_2000	Apparently it’s traveling all over the world to hone\nits skills.
A4_11310_TIM_500_2000	Oh yeah? I feel like we’ve met a Pokémon who said\nsomething similar before...
A4_11400_BXMANMID01_200_1000	I won’t share my findings on Dunsparce, but I do plan\non continuing my research!
A4_11400_BXMANMID01_200_2000	My next research topic will be how to become friends\nwith it.
A4_11400_TIM_200_1000	I think that’s a great idea. Good luck!
A4_11400_PIKACHU_200_1000	Here’s hoping his research doesn’t cause Dunsparce\nany more grief.
A4_11400_BXMANMID01_300_1000	Did you find the rare Pokémon I’ve been looking for?
A4_11400_TIM_300_1000	No, we haven’t. But we’ll let you know if we do.
A4_11400_BXMANMID01_400_1000	Hey, you two! Got a minute?
A4_11400_TIM_400_1000	Errr... Can I help you?
A4_11400_BXMANMID01_400_2000	Oh, sorry if I startled you! I’m a Pokémon researcher!
A4_11400_BXMANMID01_400_3000	There’s supposedly a very rare Pokémon that lives in\nthis bamboo forest.
A4_11400_BXMANMID01_400_4000	I’ve been walking around searching for it for so long\nthat my legs are starting to go numb! And I still can’t\nseem to find it...
A4_11400_TIM_400_2000	What sort of rare Pokémon?
A4_11400_BXMANMID01_400_5000	A Dunsparce!
A4_11400_BXMANMID01_400_6000	At the mere sight of a human, it digs a hole as quickly\nas it can and burrows itself away!
A4_11400_PIKACHU_400_1000	Doesn’t sound too fond of humans. Maybe it’s shy?
A4_11400_BXMANMID01_400_7000	If you ever come across a Dunsparce, please let me\nknow! I’d give anything to see it for myself.
A4_11400_TIM_400_3000	Sure. We’ll let you know if we spot one.
A4_11400_BXMANMID01_400_8000	Thanks! Hope you’ll be back with some good news!
A4_11410_SECRETNOKOCCHI_100_1000	*rumble*
A4_11410_PIKACHU_100_1000	Tim—did you hear that?
A4_11410_TIM_100_1000	Huh? I didn’t hear anything.
A4_11410_PIKACHU_100_2000	Huh... Must’ve been my imagination.
A4_11420_SECRETNOKOCCHI_100_1000	*rumble rumble* *thud*
A4_11420_TIM_100_1000	I just heard a strange noise...
A4_11420_PIKACHU_100_1000	You heard it too?!
A4_11420_TIM_100_2000	I think the sound came from the cliff over there.\nLet’s go!
A4_11430_SECRETNOKOCCHI_100_1000	*rumble rumble*
A4_11430_PIKACHU_100_1000	A dead end...
A4_11430_SECRETNOKOCCHI_100_2000	*rumble rumble*
A4_11430_TIM_100_1000	Pikachu! Something’s coming out of the ground!
A4_11430_NOKOCCHI_100_1000	Sparce...
A4_11430_PIKACHU_100_2000	Now here’s a Pokémon I’ve never met...\nWho are you?
A4_11430_BXMANMID01_100_1000	Aha! I’m glad I decided to follow you two!
A4_11430_BXMANMID01_100_2000	So the rumors were true—there really is a Dunsparce\nliving here!
A4_11430_NOKOCCHI_100_2000	Spaaarce...
A4_11430_PIKACHU_100_3000	So you’re Dunsparce? You look pretty shaken up...
A4_11430_TIM_100_2000	Um... What are you planning on doing now?
A4_11430_BXMANMID01_100_3000	I’m going to present my findings and tell the whole\nworld that Dunsparce lives HERE!
A4_11430_BXMANMID01_100_4000	My once-in-a-lifetime discovery is going to make me\nfamous and put this little neighborhood on the map!
A4_11430_BXMANMID01_100_5000	I can see it now... “Bamboo Borough, global tourist\ndestination and home of the elusive Dunsparce!”
A4_11430_PIKACHU_100_4000	Whoa there... If you go broadcasting Dunsparce’s\nwhereabouts like that, it’s not gonna wanna live here\nanymore.
A4_11430_NOKOCCHI_100_3000	Sparce...
A4_11430_TIM_100_3000	Seems to me like Dunsparce wants to live a quiet life.
A4_11430_TIM_100_4000	I know you’re excited to share this with everyone, but\nhave you considered...not doing that?
A4_11430_BXMANMID01_100_6000	Huh? A discovery like this only comes once in a\nlifetime! There’s no way I’m letting it slip through\nmy fingers!
A4_11430_NOKOCCHI_100_4000	Sparce...
A4_11430_BXMANMID01_100_7000	And once I present my findings, researchers the\nworld over will know my name. I’ll become an\novernight celebrity!
A4_11430_NOKOCCHI_100_5000	Sparce...
A4_11430_TIM_100_5000	Have you even considered how Dunsparce might\nfeel? Just look at that face!
A4_11430_NOKOCCHI_100_6000	Sparce...
A4_11430_BXMANMID01_100_8000	Wahhh! Oh, Dunsparce! I can see the sadness in\nyour eyes!
A4_11430_NOKOCCHI_100_7000	Sparce...
A4_11430_BXMANMID01_100_9000	All right... I’m sorry for frightening you, Dunsparce.
A4_11430_BXMANMID01_100_10000	I’ll keep this discovery to myself. I’m a researcher,\nafter all—my duty is to preserve your quiet lifestyle,\nnot turn it upside down.
A4_11430_NOKOCCHI_100_8000	Sparce...?
A4_11430_PIKACHU_100_5000	Don’t worry, Dunsparce. You’re safe now.
A4_11440_NOKOCCHI_100_1000	Sparce...
A4_11440_TIM_100_1000	Sorry for all that commotion earlier. We didn’t mean\nto startle you.
A4_1150_BHMAN01_100_1000	Hello there—huh?
A4_1150_TIM_100_1000	Is something wrong?
A4_1150_BHMAN01_100_2000	Er... This is the first time we’ve met, right?
A4_1150_TIM_100_2000	I think so. Why do you ask?
A4_1150_BHMAN01_100_3000	You remind me of someone I met a while back who\nhelped an injured Pokémon.
A4_1150_TIM_100_3000	I see. We must look similar, huh?
A4_1150_PIKACHU_100_1000	Maybe you have a doppelganger, Tim.
A4_1150_TIM_100_4000	By the way, can I ask you a few questions?
A4_1150_BHMAN01_200_1000	You really do remind me of that person who helped\nthat injured Pokémon.
A4_1150_SEL_0_1000	About Bamboo Borough...
A4_1150_SEL_0_2000	See anything unusual lately?
A4_1150_BHMAN01_300_1000	The air here feels really clean, doesn’t it? Why do you\nthink that is?
A4_1150_TIM_300_1000	I don’t know. Why?
A4_1150_BHMAN01_300_2000	Because bamboo plants keep the air clean. If you put\nbamboo charcoal in your room, it’ll keep the air clean\nthere too!
A4_1150_PIKACHU_300_1000	I guess bamboo charcoal isn’t just used for fuel.
A4_1150_TIM_300_2000	Maybe we can gift some as souvenirs.
A4_1150_PIKACHU_300_2000	Good idea. Let’s get some for Pablo and Holiday too.
A4_1150_TIM_400_1000	Have you noticed anything unusual in the\nneighborhood lately?
A4_1150_BHMAN01_400_1000	Nope! Everything’s the same as ever. Just look at\nMs. J—she’s busy like always.
A4_1150_TIM_400_2000	Ms. J? Who’s that?
A4_1150_BHMAN01_400_2000	Ms. Jessica! She knows a LOT about Pokémon.
A4_1150_TIM_400_3000	Jessica?! Do you know where she is right now?
A4_1150_BHMAN01_400_3000	I saw her leave the pizzeria earlier.
A4_1150_TIM_400_4000	Thanks. We’ll keep looking around here, then.
A4_11500_KODUCK_200_1000	Psy.
A4_11500_PIKACHU_200_1000	Your partner must’ve been under serious pressure if\nshe had to leave you behind.
A4_11500_PIKACHU_200_2000	It’s good that she’s passionate about her job, but\nmaybe she oughta relax a little.
A4_11500_TIM_200_1000	Aren’t you worried about not being with your partner,\nPsyduck?
A4_11500_PIKACHU_200_3000	Good point. I’d be worried too. You all right, buddy?
A4_11500_KODUCK_200_2000	Psy?
A4_11500_PIKACHU_200_4000	...How can you stay so unruffled?
A4_11500_KODUCK_300_1000	Psyduck!
A4_11500_PIKACHU_300_1000	Hey, Psyduck. What are you doing here?
A4_11500_KODUCK_300_2000	Psy!
A4_11500_TIM_300_1000	What’s it saying, Pikachu?
A4_11500_PIKACHU_300_2000	Psyduck’s partner is conducting interviews around\nhere.
A4_11500_PIKACHU_300_3000	She’s doing a special report on local restaurants, so\nshe’s looking for good places to eat.
A4_11500_PIKACHU_300_4000	It’s asking if we know of any good places.
A4_11500_TIM_300_2000	We only just got here, so I’m not really sure.
A4_11500_PIKACHU_300_5000	My number one recommendation is the pizzeria\nright there.
A4_11500_PIKACHU_300_6000	Their oven-fresh bamboo charcoal pizza is outta\nthis world!
A4_11500_PIKACHU_300_7000	The curry place over there is good too.
A4_11500_PIKACHU_300_8000	They put Tamato Berries in their curry, so it’s super\nspicy. But it goes so well with coffee!
A4_11500_TIM_300_3000	You say that like you’ve eaten at all these places...
A4_11500_PIKACHU_300_9000	Huh? Yeah, guess you’re right... I wonder why...
A4_11500_PIKACHU_300_10000	Anyway, you said your partner’s doing interviews for a\nspecial report. Is she a reporter?
A4_11500_KODUCK_300_3000	Psyduck!
A4_11500_PIKACHU_300_11000	Oh, OK! Your partner’s a reporter for GNN.
A4_11500_KODUCK_300_4000	Psyduck...
A4_11500_PIKACHU_300_12000	Well then, Psyduck, tell your partner we say hello!
A4_11500_KODUCK_300_5000	Psy! Psy psy!
A4_1160_BAWOMAN01_100_1000	I’m a big fan of the pizzeria in this neighborhood!\nI could eat there every day, no problem.
A4_1160_TIM_100_1000	Is it that good?
A4_1160_BAWOMAN01_100_2000	Oh, man... I don’t even have the words to DESCRIBE\nhow good it is.
A4_1160_PIKACHU_100_1000	She must be talking about the pizzeria where Jessica\nworks. Let’s ask her about it.
A4_1160_TIM_100_2000	Right. Excuse me—could we ask you a few questions?
A4_1160_BAWOMAN01_100_3000	Of course. If you’ve got questions about pizza, I’m\nyour gal!
A4_1160_BAWOMAN01_200_1000	If you’ve got questions about pizza, I’m your gal!
A4_1160_PIKACHU_200_1000	I sure hope she knows about more than just pizza...
A4_1160_SEL_0_1000	About the pizza in Bamboo Borough...
A4_1160_SEL_0_2000	See anything unusual lately?
A4_1160_BAWOMAN01_300_1000	The pizzeria in this neighborhood is famous among\npizza enthusiasts.
A4_1160_PIKACHU_300_1000	Famous, huh? Now I wanna try it.
A4_1160_TIM_300_1000	We can get some after we finish our investigation.
A4_1160_TIM_400_1000	Have you noticed anything unusual in the\nneighborhood lately?
A4_1160_BAWOMAN01_400_1000	Let’s see... Something strange happened yesterday at\nthe pizzeria.
A4_1160_TIM_400_2000	What? At the pizzeria?!
A4_1160_PIKACHU_400_1000	Tim! If it happened yesterday, that must mean—
A4_1160_TIM_400_3000	Yeah! Can you tell me more about what happened?
A4_1160_BAWOMAN01_400_2000	They served me something that wasn’t on the menu.\nDoes that mean they consider me a regular now?!
A4_1160_TIM_400_4000	Wait, THAT was the strange thing?
A4_1160_PIKACHU_400_2000	One thing’s for sure—she really loves that pizzeria.
A4_1180_PARAS_100_1000	Para paraaa!
A4_1180_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says his partner is obsessed with pizza.
A4_1180_TIM_100_1000	That must be a lot to deal with...
A4_1180_PARAS_200_1000	Para paraaa!
A4_1180_PIKACHU_200_1000	He says his partner is obsessed with pizza.
A4_1180_SEL_0_1000	About Bamboo Borough...
A4_1180_SEL_0_2000	See anything unusual lately?
A4_1180_PARAS_300_1000	Paras! Paras!
A4_1180_PIKACHU_300_1000	He says the manager of the pizzeria and the folks at\nthe herbal remedy shop are always glancing at him.
A4_1180_TIM_300_1000	I guess they really like him?
A4_1180_PIKACHU_400_1000	Have you witnessed anything unusual lately?
A4_1180_PARAS_400_1000	Para para!
A4_1180_PIKACHU_400_2000	Nothing in particular, huh? Well, sorry to bother you.
A4_1200_PIZZASTORE_100_1000	HI THERE! Thanks for stopping by!
A4_1200_PIZZASTORE_100_2000	It is my abso-lute PLEASURE to welcome you to the\nfamous Bamboo Borough Pizzeria!
A4_1200_TIM_100_1000	U-uh... Thanks?
A4_1200_PIZZASTORE_100_3000	Our pizza dough is infused with bamboo charcoal,\ngiving it an aroma and flavor unlike anything you’ve\ntasted. You could say our pizza has real...pizzazz!
A4_1200_TIM_100_2000	You sure have a lot of energy...
A4_1200_PIZZASTORE_100_4000	Good pizza starts with good energy. That’s my motto!
A4_1200_PIKACHU_100_1000	Come on, let’s ask him some questions.
A4_1200_PIZZASTORE_200_1000	The aroma and flavor of our pizzas can’t be beat!
A4_1200_SEL_0_1000	About the pizzeria...
A4_1200_SEL_0_2000	About Jessica...
A4_1200_PIZZASTORE_300_1000	I’m actually in the middle of concocting a new\ntype of pizza.
A4_1200_PIZZASTORE_300_2000	It’s a mushroom pizza that uses tochukaso!
A4_1200_PIZZASTORE_300_3000	I’ve got a hit on my hands, don’t you think?
A4_1200_TIM_300_1000	Tochukaso? Is that some type of herbal medicine?
A4_1200_PIZZASTORE_300_4000	That’s right! Good guess. The idea popped into my\nhead when I saw a Paras.
A4_1200_PIKACHU_300_1000	I’m sure people would enjoy a health-minded pizza.
A4_1200_TIM_400_1000	We’re looking for the woman in this photo. We\nheard she works here.
A4_1200_PIZZASTORE_400_1000	She does, yeah. That’s Jessica.
A4_1200_PIZZASTORE_400_2000	She’s been working here about two years now. Why\nare you looking for her?
A4_1200_TIM_400_2000	She’s a friend of ours.
A4_1200_PIZZASTORE_400_3000	Ahh, gotcha. Well, I’m sure she’d be happy to know\nyou came by.
A4_1200_PIZZASTORE_400_4000	I’m afraid she’s not here at the moment, though.\nI believe she’s gone to get bamboo charcoal and\nother pizza ingredients.
A4_1200_PIKACHU_400_1000	That’s an important job when you work at a\nrestaurant.
A4_1200_TIM_400_3000	That’s helpful to know, thank you.
A4_1200_PIZZASTORE_400_5000	The bamboo charcoal shop is right over there. Why\ndon’t you go take a look?
A4_1202_TIM_100_1000	Looks like no one’s at the bamboo charcoal shop.
A4_1205_TIM_100_1000	Hey Pikachu, what is this?
A4_1205_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s bamboo charcoal. Local charcoal artisans burn\nbamboo to create it.
A4_1205_TIM_100_2000	Wow. That was a surprisingly thorough answer.
A4_1205_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, I guess it was.
A4_1205_TIM_100_3000	I wonder if the workshop is in the back.
A4_1205_PIKACHU_100_3000	It’s possible. I can hear some faint noises.
A4_1205_TIM_100_4000	Should we go check?
A4_1205_PIKACHU_100_4000	Nah. Best not to disturb an artisan at work.
A4_1205_PIKACHU_100_5000	Besides, we’d probably hear Jessica’s voice if she was\nback there.
A4_1205_TIM_100_5000	Yeah, you’re right.
A4_1206_TIM_100_1000	The bamboo charcoal shop hasn’t opened yet.
A4_1206_PIKACHU_100_1000	Artisans are usually pretty passionate about their\nwork, so maybe he’s out making charcoal.
A4_1230_JESSICA_100_1000	Are you OK?
A4_1230_CHARCOALMASTER_100_1000	Ah, don’t worry. I’ve jus’ gone and thrown out my\nback again. Owww...
A4_1230_RACHEL_100_1000	Jessica!
A4_1230_JESSICA_100_2000	Rachel? Tim?
A4_1230_CHARCOALMASTER_100_2000	Friends of Jessica, are you? ’Course my back’d\ndecide to give out NOW...
A4_1230_CHARCOALMASTER_100_3000	Hmm...?
A4_1230_TIM_100_1000	Uh... Is something wrong?
A4_1230_CHARCOALMASTER_100_4000	No, no. Jus’ sittin’ with a memory. Sorry for the\ntrouble, Jessica.
A4_1230_JESSICA_100_3000	Please, don’t be sorry. Just take it easy.
A4_1230_CHARCOALMASTER_100_5000	Wish I could at least deliver the bamboo charcoal,\nbut I’m outta stock, sorry to say.
A4_1230_JESSICA_100_4000	In that case, I can go to the kiln and get some\ncharcoal.
A4_1230_JESSICA_100_5000	I was about to go to the bamboo forest to collect\nsome pizza ingredients anyway.
A4_1230_CHARCOALMASTER_100_6000	Mighty kind of you to offer, but I fear the bamboo\ncharcoal might be too heavy for one person to\nmanage alone...
A4_1230_TIM_100_2000	We can help!
A4_1230_RACHEL_100_2000	I’m up for that! What do you think, Jessica?
A4_1230_JESSICA_100_6000	Thanks you two! That’d be a big help.
A4_1230_CHARCOALMASTER_100_7000	Much obliged. Sorry to put you both to work after\nyou came all this way to see Jessica.
A4_1230_TIM_100_3000	We’re happy to help—really.
A4_1230_RACHEL_100_3000	We’ll give it our all!
A4_1230_RACHEL_100_4000	I’m getting pumped up just thinking about it!
A4_1230_NYARTH_100_1000	Meowth! Meow meow!
A4_1230_JESSICA_100_7000	Thanks, Meowth! Take care of the boss for me, OK?
A4_1230_NYARTH_100_2000	Meowth!
A4_1230_TIM_100_4000	The bamboo forest is beyond the gate, right? It was\nlocked earlier.
A4_1230_CHARCOALMASTER_100_8000	What? That apprentice of mine... Did he lock the gate\nwhen he left for the charcoal kiln?
A4_1230_CHARCOALMASTER_100_9000	Hmph! I told ’im to keep the gate open from morning\nto eveni—owwww!
A4_1230_JESSICA_100_8000	Easy! Getting worked up isn’t going to help your back.
A4_1230_CHARCOALMASTER_100_10000	Here, take the key—and be careful out there!
A4_1230_JESSICA_100_9000	We will! Thank you.
A4_1230_PIKACHU_100_1000	Seems like those people targeting Jessica haven’t\nmade it here yet.
A4_1230_TIM_100_5000	Yeah, thankfully.
A4_1230_RACHEL_100_5000	Hey, Jessica, how are you doing? You haven’t seen\nanyone suspicious around, have you?
A4_1230_JESSICA_100_10000	I don’t think so... Why?
A4_1230_RACHEL_100_6000	Oh, it’s nothing. Never mind.
A4_1230_RACHEL_100_7000	C’mon, let’s hurry up and get this done!
A4_1240_RACHEL_100_1000	I’m so glad Jessica’s OK. Looks like no one shady’s\nbeen around, either.
A4_1240_RACHEL_100_2000	Let’s help her out before we ask her any questions.
A4_1250_JESSICA_100_1000	Sorry you have to deal with this. I know you came\nhere to have fun.
A4_1250_TIM_100_1000	It’s no big deal, seriously!
A4_1250_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, what’re friends for?
A4_1250_JESSICA_100_2000	I don’t mean to rush you, but do you mind if we head\nover to the bamboo forest to get the charcoal and\ningredients now?
A4_1250_JESSICA_100_3000	It’s just around the corner on the other side of\nthe gate.
A4_1260_CHARCOALMASTER_100_1000	Sorry for the hassle, but I really do ’ppreciate\nyour help.
A4_1260_TIM_100_1000	We’ve got this covered! You just take it easy for\na while.
A4_1260_CHARCOALMASTER_100_2000	Feels a li’l pathetic, what with not bein’ able to get\nthe charcoal myself, but I’ll try an’ rest up.
A4_1270_PIZZASTORE_100_1000	I’m grateful the pizzeria’s doing such great business,\nbut it’s got me running around so much my head\nis spinning!
A4_1270_PIZZASTORE_100_2000	If I had more time I’d go get the ingredients myself!
A4_1270_TIM_100_1000	Couldn’t you just have ingredients delivered from\nsomewhere else?
A4_1270_PIZZASTORE_100_3000	Of course not!
A4_1270_PIZZASTORE_100_4000	The locally sourced ingredients are the SOUL of\nBamboo Borough Pizzeria!
A4_1270_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s pretty particular, huh? Guess we’re just gonna\nhave to go get those ingredients.
A4_1280_NYARTH_100_1000	Meow! Meow meooow.
A4_1280_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s happy to answer our questions if it’ll help\nJessica.
A4_1280_TIM_100_1000	Great, thanks!
A4_1280_NYARTH_200_1000	Meow meow. Meowth!
A4_1280_PIKACHU_200_1000	He’s ready for your questions, Tim.
A4_1280_SEL_0_1000	About Bamboo Borough...
A4_1280_SEL_0_2000	About Jessica...
A4_1280_NYARTH_300_1000	Meow meow.
A4_1280_PIKACHU_300_1000	At first he thought there wasn’t much to do here, but\nnow he actually likes it that way.
A4_1280_NYARTH_300_2000	Meow meow. Meowth.
A4_1280_PIKACHU_300_2000	We should move here too, huh? I see the appeal,\nbut...
A4_1280_TIM_300_1000	But?
A4_1280_PIKACHU_300_3000	There’s not a single café around here.
A4_1280_TIM_300_2000	Oh man—how would you survive?!
A4_1280_NYARTH_400_1000	Meowth. Meow meow.
A4_1280_PIKACHU_400_1000	He says that he and Jessica have been together for a\nlong time now.
A4_1280_PIKACHU_400_2000	She got a lot happier after she moved to this\nneighborhood.
A4_1280_NYARTH_400_2000	Meooowth.
A4_1280_PIKACHU_400_3000	She enjoyed her old job a lot, but she was exhausted\nall the time.
A4_1280_TIM_400_1000	She seems to get on well with the people here.\nSounds like she made the right decision for herself!
A4_1290_CHARCOALDISCIPLE01_100_1000	The boss hurt his back?! Ah, jeez... I should really\ncheck up on him, but...
A4_1290_TIM_100_1000	What’s wrong?
A4_1290_CHARCOALDISCIPLE01_100_2000	He gets REAL angry when I stop in the middle\nof working!
A4_1290_CHARCOALDISCIPLE01_100_3000	A senior apprentice is at the charcoal kiln...and I\ngotta finish up my own work...
A4_1290_PIKACHU_100_1000	Seems like a difficult situation.
A4_1290_CHARCOALDISCIPLE01_100_4000	Rrrgh! I’ll just have to do my work quickly—but I’ll still\nbe as thorough as ever!
A4_1415_PIZZASTORE_100_1000	Huh. Well, “great detective” or not, I can’t say I’ve\nheard of you.
A4_1415_HARRY_100_1000	Well...you’d know if you were in the know, y’know!
A4_1415_PIZZASTORE_100_2000	Right. So, you’re here on official business, then?
A4_1415_PIZZASTORE_100_3000	Did something happen to warrant investigation by a\ngreat detective...?
A4_1415_HARRY_100_2000	Yep! That incident with the berserk Pokémon.
A4_1415_PIZZASTORE_100_4000	Wh-what? You came all the way here for that?
A4_1415_PIZZASTORE_100_5000	We reported it to the police, so there’s no need to\nput yourself in danger.
A4_1415_PIZZASTORE_100_6000	Plus, the bamboo forest is closed off right now.
A4_1415_HARRY_100_3000	Right, understandably.
A4_1415_PIZZASTORE_100_7000	It would be dangerous if the berserk Pokémon got\ninto this area.
A4_1415_PIZZASTORE_100_8000	We all came to an agreement that we should keep\nthe gate locked until the police give us permission\nto reopen it.
A4_1415_PIZZASTORE_100_9000	For now, the boss is holding on to the key.
A4_1415_HARRY_100_4000	That all makes sense. The safety of everyone in\nthis neighborhood is the top priority.
A4_1415_HARRY_100_5000	Who’s this “boss” you mentioned?
A4_1415_PIZZASTORE_100_10000	The master of the charcoal shop—and he’s also\nresponsible for tending the bamboo forest.
A4_1415_HARRY_100_6000	Hence why he has the key to the gate.
A4_1415_HARRY_100_7000	Well, that was all very helpful. Thanks! Sorry to bother\nyou at such a busy time. Your pizzeria must be\nopening for lunch soon.
A4_1415_PIZZASTORE_100_11000	Wha...? How did you know I run a pizzeria?
A4_1415_HARRY_100_8000	The flour and sauce on your clothes are fresh. Plus, I\ncan smell the bamboo charcoal on you.
A4_1415_PIZZASTORE_100_12000	Huh... Guess you really are a great detective!
A4_1415_PIZZASTORE_100_13000	Well, I’m going to head back now.
A4_1415_HARRY_100_9000	I’ll stop by your shop later.
A4_1415_HARRY_100_10000	There’ve been multiple eyewitness reports of Pokémon\ngoing berserk in the city...
A4_1415_HARRY_100_11000	but I didn’t think those same incidents would happen\nin a peaceful place like this.
A4_1415_HARRY_100_12000	Seems like something’s afoot in Ryme City.
A4_1415_HARRY_100_13000	I’ll start my investigation by talking to locals.
A4_1415_HARRY_100_14000	Great Detective Tip #12: Use those legs\nwhile investigating!
A4_1420_HARRY_100_1000	Whoops! I’d be heading back to Ryme City if I went\nthat way.
A4_1420_HARRY_100_2000	I’ll continue the investigation here for now.
A4_1425_HARRY_100_1000	The gate to the bamboo forest is locked.
A4_1425_HARRY_100_2000	The master of the charcoal shop should have the key.\nI’ll go talk to him.
A4_1430_HARRY_100_1000	“Warning: Berserk Pokémon,” huh?
A4_1435_CHARCOALMASTER_100_1000	Owww...
A4_1435_HARRY_100_1000	Did you hurt your back?
A4_1435_CHARCOALMASTER_100_2000	Ah, a customer... Sorry you hafta see me like this.
A4_1435_CHARCOALMASTER_100_3000	I promise this month’s batch of bamboo charcoal is in\nmuch better shape than my back is!
A4_1435_HARRY_100_2000	Oh no, please—stay where you are. I’m...well, take a\nlook at this.
A4_1435_CHARCOALMASTER_100_4000	Hmm. A detective, eh?
A4_1435_HARRY_100_3000	Not just a detec—sorry, sorry. Force of habit.\nYes, I’m here to investigate the berserk Pokémon.
A4_1435_HARRY_100_4000	I’d like to take a look around the bamboo forest, if\nyou don’t mind. I won’t cause any trouble—
A4_1435_CHARCOALMASTER_100_5000	The gate to the bamboo forest is locked!
A4_1435_CHARCOALMASTER_100_6000	We can’t let any berserk Pokémon into this area!\nThe gate’s stayin’ closed—for public safety, y’hear?!
A4_1435_CHARCOALMASTER_100_7000	I don’t care if you wanna investigate! I ain’t budgin’\non this!
A4_1435_HARRY_100_5000	A-all right, all right! Can I at least ask you a few\nquestions, then?
A4_1435_CHARCOALMASTER_100_8000	Look at you with your detective notebook and all...
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_100_1000	What do you wanna know?
A4_1440_SEL_0_1000	About Bamboo Borough...
A4_1440_SEL_0_2000	About the berserk Pokémon...
A4_1440_SEL_0_3000	About the bamboo forest...
A4_1440_SEL_0_4000	About the Pikachu...
A4_1440_SEL_0_5000	Something that could heal Pancham...
A4_1440_HARRY_300_1000	I heard this area is famous for its bamboo forest and\nbamboo charcoal.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_300_1000	Yep! Right you are!
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_300_2000	Bamboo charcoal’s got antibacterial and deodorizin’\nproperties, an’ it can improve the quality of water an’\nsoil too.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_300_3000	Wonderful product, really. Jus’ put it in a room, and\nit makes everythin’ better.
A4_1440_HARRY_300_2000	No wonder it’s famous.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_300_4000	You have my loyal customers to thank for that.\nIf only I could make more...
A4_1440_HARRY_300_3000	Do you make the charcoal all by yourself?
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_300_5000	Pretty much... I reckon I should start lookin’ for an\napprentice. Say, you wouldn’t happen to know any\npromising young upstarts who might be interested?
A4_1440_HARRY_300_4000	Well, I have a son and a daughter—and they sure\nseem promising to me.
A4_1440_HARRY_300_5000	I’m not sure they’re too interested in a career in\nmaking charcoal, though.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_300_6000	Yep... Best to let your children choose their own paths\nin life.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_300_7000	Thanks all the same. I’m sure I’ll find an\napprentice yet.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_400_1000	The berserk Pokémon... Reckon it showed up ’bout\na week ago.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_400_2000	Never seen it myself, but I’ve heard it makin’ noise an’\ncausin’ all kinds of ruckus.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_400_3000	Three days ago, <color=#F39800FF>I went to the charcoal kiln and found\nit wrecked up somethin’ fierce</color>.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_400_4000	That berserk Pokémon mighta done it.
A4_1440_HARRY_400_1000	Interesting... Was there anything else unusual about\nthe area?
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_400_5000	No, jus’ the wrecked kiln. Nothin’ seemed to be\nstolen.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_400_6000	Tried to clean it up, an’ that’s when I hurt my back.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_400_7000	Haven’t been back to the bamboo forest since.
A4_1440_HARRY_400_2000	That’s probably for the best.
A4_1440_HARRY_400_3000	You should take it easy and leave the clean-up to the\nother folks here.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_400_8000	Once my back’s straightened out, I’m gettin’ back to\nwork like you wouldn’t believe! I’ll be makin’ trips to\nthe bamboo forest, too, of course.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_400_9000	I ain’t lettin’ some berserk Pokémon scare me outta\nrunnin’ my bamboo charcoal shop!
A4_1440_HARRY_400_4000	Heh. I like your spirit.
A4_1440_HARRY_400_5000	Sounds like I should pay that wrecked charcoal kiln\na visit.
A4_1440_HARRY_500_1000	So, about the gate...
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_500_1000	I told you—I ain’t openin’ it! Detective or otherwise,\nno one’s allowed in. 
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_500_2000	It’s too dangerous! What if you run into the berserk\nPokémon?!
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_500_3000	I ain’t openin’ the gate, and I ain’t giving you the\nkey, either—hrghk! M-my back...
A4_1440_HARRY_500_2000	All right, all right—I hear you.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_600_1000	The Pikachu, eh? It’s new to the area. Only started\nseein’ it around recently.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_600_2000	Seems like a prickly sort if you ask me. You’d best not\nbother it too much.
A4_1440_HARRY_600_1000	Yeah, I learned that firsthand.
A4_1440_HARRY_600_2000	It stood its ground to protect an injured Pancham.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_600_3000	Gutsy little Pokémon, eh? That’s worthy of praise in\nmy book.
A4_1440_HARRY_700_1000	Do you have any sort of medicine by chance?
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_700_1000	Are you hurt? I warned you about going in there!
A4_1440_HARRY_700_2000	Nah, it’s not for me. There’s an injured Pancham that\nneeds some help.
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_700_2000	Ah, I see. Hmm, lemme think...
A4_1440_CHARCOALMASTER_700_3000	<color=#F39800FF>How ’bout this bag of ice? I reckon you can use it to\nice its wound.</color>
A4_1440_HARRY_700_3000	Hm, that’s not a bad idea.
A4_1440_HARRY_700_4000	Thanks!
A4_1441_HARRY_100_1000	Hmm... What should I do?
A4_1445_PIZZASTORE_100_1000	HI THERE! Thanks for stopping by!
A4_1445_PIZZASTORE_100_2000	Oh, Harry! It is my abso-lute PLEASURE to welcome\nyou to the famous Bamboo Borough Pizzeria!
A4_1445_HARRY_100_1000	You’re, uh...a lot livelier than the last time I saw you.
A4_1445_PIZZASTORE_100_3000	But of course—I’m here at the pizzeria!
A4_1445_PIZZASTORE_100_4000	Good pizza starts with good energy. That’s my motto!
A4_1445_PIZZASTORE_100_5000	So, how about some pizza for lunch?
A4_1445_HARRY_100_2000	Sounds great! I’d love a slice.
A4_1445_HARRY_100_3000	But before that, can I ask you a few questions?
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_100_1000	I’m happy to help with your detective work in\nwhatever way I can!
A4_1450_SEL_0_1000	About Bamboo Borough...
A4_1450_SEL_0_2000	About the berserk Pokémon...
A4_1450_SEL_0_3000	About the bamboo forest...
A4_1450_SEL_0_4000	About the Pikachu...
A4_1450_SEL_0_5000	Something that could heal Pancham...
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_300_1000	The Bamboo Borough Pizzeria is this neighborhood’s\nmost delicious attraction! Our pizza is baked to\nperfection, with an aroma to match!
A4_1450_HARRY_300_1000	That sounds delicious. I’m sure it goes well with\ncoffee too.
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_300_2000	Absolutely! Please, try some for yourself!
A4_1450_HARRY_300_2000	I can picture it now—enjoying a slice of pizza and a\nsteaming cup of coffee while a breeze rolls through\nthe bamboo forest...
A4_1450_HARRY_300_3000	I can see why your pizza shop is so popular.
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_300_3000	Right?! Oh, by the way—this is a pizzeria, not a\n“pizza shop.”
A4_1450_HARRY_300_4000	Is there a difference?
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_300_4000	Trust me—there’s a difference.
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_400_1000	The day the bamboo forest got closed off, <color=#F39800FF>I saw some\nsmall Pokémon sumo wrestling</color>.
A4_1450_HARRY_400_1000	Sumo wrestling?! Now that’s a rare sight!
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_400_2000	Could they have been the same Pokémon that went\nberserk...? No, there’s no way.
A4_1450_HARRY_400_2000	It’s not impossible, though. Did you notice\nanything else?
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_400_3000	Well, I heard some Pokémon cries and noises, but I\nnever actually saw them. Can’t really give you many\nconcrete details, I’m afraid.
A4_1450_HARRY_400_3000	I see. Thanks.
A4_1450_HARRY_400_4000	Small Pokémon sumo wrestling, huh...
A4_1450_HARRY_500_1000	The closure of the bamboo forest must’ve caused you\na lot of trouble. How are you holding up?
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_500_1000	Well, I need bamboo charcoal to run my pizzeria...
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_500_2000	So if the bamboo forest stays closed for too long, I\nwon’t be able to make my famous pizza.
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_500_3000	I hope this all gets resolved soon so I can start making\ncharcoal runs again...
A4_1450_HARRY_500_2000	Me too. I’ll do my best to help you out!
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_600_1000	Apparently a Pikachu recently started living in the\nbamboo forest!
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_600_2000	As an Electric-type Pokémon in a place full of Grass-\nand Bug-type Pokémon, it really stands out!
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_600_3000	I just hope it hasn’t run into any berserk Pokémon...
A4_1450_HARRY_600_1000	I actually encountered that Pikachu earlier. It seemed\npretty wary of people.
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_600_4000	Oh yeah? I’m glad to hear it’s OK.
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_600_5000	Wait... Does that mean you managed to borrow the\nkey from the charcoal shop master?
A4_1450_HARRY_600_2000	Sure did.
A4_1450_HARRY_700_1000	Could you help me out with something? I came across\nan injured Pancham, and it’s in pretty rough shape.
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_700_1000	Oh no! An injured Pancham?!
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_700_2000	Hmm. First and foremost, it needs to get its strength\nback...
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_700_3000	I know—take this!
A4_1450_HARRY_700_2000	Wait... A whole pizza?
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_700_4000	That’s right! <color=#F39800FF>It’s made with healthy herbs!</color>
A4_1450_PIZZASTORE_700_5000	That Pancham’ll be back to full strength in no time\nonce it has a belly full of this!
A4_1450_HARRY_700_3000	O-oh, I see. Well, thanks!
A4_1455_BAWOMANMID01_100_1000	Oh, welcome.
A4_1455_BAWOMANMID01_100_2000	Sorry, but we don’t have much in stock right now.
A4_1455_HARRY_100_1000	An herbal remedy shop with no herbal remedies...\nSo just a shop, then?
A4_1455_BAWOMANMID01_100_3000	We’ve sold through most of our inventory.
A4_1455_BAWOMANMID01_100_4000	The owner left to get more ingredients, but he’s still\nnot back...
A4_1455_HARRY_100_2000	Guess I caught you at a bad time.
A4_1455_BAWOMANMID01_100_5000	Eh, not really! I’m just holding down the fort here, so\nI’ve got plenty of time to talk.
A4_1455_HARRY_100_3000	In that case, could I ask you a few questions?
A4_1455_BAWOMANMID01_100_6000	Oh, is this your card? Let’s see here... A detective?\nWow! You don’t meet one of those every day.
A4_1455_BAWOMANMID01_100_7000	Ask away, I guess! I’ll answer whatever I can. I’m\npretty bored right now anyway, so this is perfect.
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_100_1000	Ask me whatever you want!
A4_1460_SEL_0_1000	About Bamboo Borough...
A4_1460_SEL_0_2000	About the berserk Pokémon...
A4_1460_SEL_0_3000	About the bamboo forest...
A4_1460_SEL_0_4000	Something that could heal Pancham...
A4_1460_SEL_0_5000	About the Energy Root...
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_300_1000	If you’re looking for herbal remedies, Bamboo\nBorough’s got you covered! Our medicine will give\nyou immediate relief, guaranteed.
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_300_2000	If you’re feeling unwell, we’ll help you quell!\n...Those bad feelings.
A4_1460_HARRY_300_1000	Sounds interesting. What kind of medicine do\nyou have?
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_300_3000	Oh, you know. All sorts! Couldn’t tell you much about\nthem, though. I’m just here to watch the shop.
A4_1460_HARRY_300_2000	You sounded like you knew what you were talking\nabout a second ago, but now I’m having second\nthoughts...
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_400_1000	Apparently there was a Pokémon going berserk in the\nbamboo forest. It caused us all sorts of trouble!
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_400_2000	I wonder if it was just in a bad mood. Maybe I’ll give\nit some herbal medicine if we run into each other!
A4_1460_HARRY_400_1000	Love where your head’s at, but that’d be pretty\ndangerous. Better steer clear.
A4_1460_HARRY_400_2000	Still, I wonder if herbal medicine works on\nPokémon too.
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_400_3000	Of course it does! Herbal medicine is amazing. It can\nbring relief to just about any ailment.
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_400_4000	I take some every day, which is why I’m always full of\nenergy! Haha!
A4_1460_HARRY_400_3000	Well, that’s one mystery solved...
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_500_1000	There are all kinds of ingredients for herbal medicine\nin the bamboo forest.
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_500_2000	Plants, mushrooms—even shed Pokémon skin.
A4_1460_HARRY_500_1000	The bamboo forest is closed off right now, though.\nIs that why the owner’s away?
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_500_3000	Yeah, he had to go somewhere far off to find the\ningredients he needs. Good guess!
A4_1460_HARRY_500_2000	Sounds like a hassle.
A4_1460_HARRY_600_1000	Could you help me out with something?
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_600_1000	What’s up? We only have herbal medicine here.
A4_1460_HARRY_600_2000	And that’s exactly what I need.
A4_1460_HARRY_600_3000	There’s an injured Pancham that could use some\nattention. It’s very weak, and I think it’s paralyzed too.
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_600_2000	You know, I think I have just the thing. It should\nbe riiight...
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_600_3000	<color=#F39800FF>Here! This Heal Powder should cure its paralysis.</color>
A4_1460_HARRY_600_4000	Perfect! Thanks a million.
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_600_4000	I wanted to give you an Energy Root too, but I think\nwe’re out... Sorry about that.
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_600_5000	They work wonders for restoring strength.
A4_1460_HARRY_600_5000	No worries at all. The Heal Powder on its own will\nbe a huge help.
A4_1460_HARRY_700_1000	So about that Energy Root—do you know where I can\nfind one?
A4_1460_HARRY_700_2000	I’d like to track one down myself if possible, so I’d\nappreciate any bits of info you can offer.
A4_1460_HARRY_700_3000	Er... Assuming they aren’t trade secrets or something.
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_700_1000	Sorry, I’m not really supposed to share that kind\nof stuff...
A4_1460_HARRY_700_4000	Yeah, I figured. Guess it was worth a shot...
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_700_2000	The owner’s son always goes out to the bamboo\nforest to collect Energy Roots.
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_700_3000	He’s got a real knack for finding them, but he won’t\ntell us adults how he does it.
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_700_4000	The owner just leaves the job to his son at this point.
A4_1460_HARRY_700_5000	He won’t share his tips with any of the adults, huh?\nInteresting. Where is he now?
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_700_5000	He used to collect rocks in the bamboo forest before\nit was closed off.
A4_1460_BAWOMANMID01_700_6000	Now, I think he just plays around here.
A4_1460_HARRY_700_6000	Thanks. I’ll go see if I can find him.
A4_1465_BKMANMID01_100_1000	Welcome! How about a souvenir to remember\nyour trip?
A4_1465_HARRY_100_1000	Sure, I’ll take a look.\n...Wow, there’s a lot of stuff here. I bet you do\ngreat business.
A4_1465_BKMANMID01_100_2000	I’m quite proud of my selection, yes. Though it might\nnot make much difference soon...
A4_1465_HARRY_100_2000	Why’s that?
A4_1465_BKMANMID01_100_3000	The berserk Pokémon, of course.
A4_1465_BKMANMID01_100_4000	I’m worried customers will stop coming here if the\nsituation keeps getting worse.
A4_1465_HARRY_100_3000	That’s bad news for a business in a tourist area...
A4_1465_HARRY_100_4000	I’m actually here to investigate the berserk Pokémon.\nI’m a detective.
A4_1465_BKMANMID01_100_5000	Oh, really?! That’s a relief.
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_100_1000	I’d love to help you out with your investigation.
A4_1470_SEL_0_1000	About Bamboo Borough...
A4_1470_SEL_0_2000	About the berserk Pokémon...
A4_1470_SEL_0_3000	About the bamboo forest...
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_300_1000	Bamboo Borough is a wonderful place. The people\nand Pokémon here are all terrifically kind.
A4_1470_HARRY_300_1000	I wonder if the lush scenery and fresh air have\nanything to do with that.
A4_1470_HARRY_300_2000	I’d love to come here one day just to sightsee. Hard\nto enjoy it properly while I’m workin’ a case.
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_300_2000	Please do! Make sure to stop by here again too.
A4_1470_HARRY_300_3000	For sure!
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_400_1000	The berserk Pokémon appeared in the bamboo forest\nrather recently.
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_400_2000	There were crackling noises coming from the\nbamboo forest...
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_400_3000	And then I heard a Pokémon go “Roooaaarrr!”
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_400_4000	Right after that, some people came running out of\nthe bamboo forest.
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_400_5000	They said they saw a shadow with red eyes going\nberserk deep in the forest...
A4_1470_HARRY_400_1000	Hmm, deep in the bamboo forest, huh... Do you think\nI could talk to those people?
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_400_6000	I believe they were all tourists, so I’m afraid they’re\nlong gone.
A4_1470_HARRY_400_2000	I see. That’s too bad. I really wish I could talk to\nmore witnesses about this...
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_500_1000	I was actually in the bamboo forest yesterday to\naccess the storage area.
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_500_2000	Thankfully, I didn’t encounter any berserk Pokémon...
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_500_3000	But a bunch of bamboo stalks were broken and the\npaths were ruined... *sigh* It was devastating...
A4_1470_HARRY_500_1000	I can imagine that wasn’t a pleasant sight... Still, I’m\nglad you were OK.
A4_1470_HARRY_500_2000	By the way, why did a souvenir shop clerk like you\nneed to go into the forest?
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_500_4000	The master of the charcoal shop hurt his back three\ndays ago, so I went in to get his supplies for him.
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_500_5000	Luckily, the storage area was undamaged. <color=#F39800FF>It was just\nthe elevator that was broken.</color>
A4_1470_HARRY_500_3000	Oh? Did the berserk Pokémon do that too?
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_500_6000	No, it happens quite often. The boss always fixes it.
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_500_7000	Ah! Please don’t tell the charcoal shop master about\nthe broken elevator!
A4_1470_BKMANMID01_500_8000	<color=#F39800FF>If he finds out, he’ll insist that he fix it himself despite\nhis injured back.</color>
A4_1470_HARRY_500_4000	Gotcha. My lips are sealed.
A4_1470_HARRY_500_5000	Hmm... Sounds like that elevator is important to the\nmaster of the charcoal shop.
A4_1475_HARRY_100_1000	Thanks for your help!
A4_1475_BKMANMID01_100_1000	Leaving already, detective? Surely you need a few\nmore souvenirs.
A4_1475_HARRY_100_2000	Hah! You’re a good salesman, aren’t you?
A4_1475_BKMANMID01_100_2000	I actually have just the thing for you.
A4_1475_BKMANMID01_100_3000	It’s a hat. How about one for your kids?
A4_1475_HARRY_100_3000	Oh hey, a kids-size detective hat! Good call.
A4_1475_HARRY_100_4000	Great Detective Tip #13: Always make sure to look\nyour very best.
A4_1475_HARRY_100_5000	This would probably fit Sophia’s head better than\nTim’s. OK, I’ll take this!
A4_1475_HARRY_100_6000	As for Tim, I’ll get him...this water bottle!
A4_1475_BKMANMID01_100_4000	Thank you very much! I’ll wrap these up for you.
A4_1475_HARRY_100_7000	Thanks. I hope they like their gifts...
A4_1475_HARRY_100_8000	All right! I better solve this case before Sophia grows\nout of this hat.
A4_1480_BAWOMAN01_100_1000	I’m a big fan of the pizzeria in this neighborhood!\nI could eat there every day, no problem.
A4_1480_HARRY_100_1000	I’ve heard their pizza is famous, but eating it every\nday seems like overkill...
A4_1480_BAWOMAN01_100_2000	Trust me—you’ll understand once you try it.
A4_1480_HARRY_100_2000	All right, I will!
A4_1485_BAWOMAN01_100_1000	I’d love to hear what you think of the pizza!
A4_1485_SEL_0_1000	About Bamboo Borough...
A4_1485_SEL_0_2000	About the berserk Pokémon...
A4_1485_SEL_0_3000	About the bamboo forest...
A4_1485_BAWOMAN01_300_1000	Is this your first time in Bamboo Borough?
A4_1485_HARRY_300_1000	Yeah. It’s a beautiful neighborhood.
A4_1485_BAWOMAN01_300_2000	Isn’t it? Between the fantastic air quality and the\ndelicious food, life’s pretty good here!
A4_1485_BAWOMAN01_400_1000	The other day, I heard crackling noises and a deep\nroar come from the bamboo forest...
A4_1485_BAWOMAN01_400_2000	It came out of nowhere, and it totally freaked me out!\nAll I could think about was making sure my poor Paras\nwas safe...
A4_1485_HARRY_400_1000	That must have been scary. Were you hurt?
A4_1485_BAWOMAN01_400_3000	No, I was OK. I heard later on that it was a berserk\nPokémon making all that noise.
A4_1485_HARRY_400_2000	The deep roar you mentioned is a helpful piece of\ninformation, but it’s still difficult to guess what kind\nof Pokémon it was...
A4_1485_BAWOMAN01_500_1000	The bamboo forest is usually so quiet and serene, but\nwe’re not allowed to go in now.
A4_1485_HARRY_500_1000	Yeah, I saw the warning sign about the berserk\nPokémon.
A4_1485_BAWOMAN01_500_2000	The folks at the pizzeria get a lot of their ingredients\nfrom the bamboo forest. At this rate, they’re gonna\nbe in trouble...
A4_1485_HARRY_500_2000	The bamboo forest plays an important role in the lives\nof the people here. Having it closed off must create\nsome serious problems.
A4_1495_PARAS_100_1000	Paraaas.
A4_1495_HARRY_100_1000	I’ve heard the mushrooms on Paras’s back are called\ntochukaso. Apparently they’re pretty rare.
A4_1495_PARAS_100_2000	Paras?!
A4_1495_HARRY_100_2000	Don’t worry—I won’t try to take ’em from you.
A4_1505_BHBOY01_100_1000	I’m so boooooored.
A4_1505_HARRY_100_1000	Hey, kiddo. Why the long face?
A4_1505_BHBOY01_100_2000	I’m not allowed to play in the bamboo forest\nanymore.
A4_1505_HARRY_100_2000	Because of the berserk Pokémon, right?
A4_1505_BHBOY01_100_3000	Yeah. I used to go in there every day, but now it’s\nsuddenly “too dangerous.”
A4_1505_HARRY_100_3000	I understand your frustration, but I think it’s best to\nplay this one safe. You can play somewhere else for\nthe time being, right?
A4_1505_BHBOY01_100_4000	Sure, but I don’t just go in there to play. I help run\nerrands too.
A4_1505_HARRY_100_4000	Is that right? Good for you!
A4_1505_BHBOY01_100_5000	Plus, like...I was there first, not the berserk Pokémon!\nThe bamboo forest’s always been MY spot!
A4_1505_HARRY_100_5000	I see why you’re upset, but...
A4_1505_BHBOY01_100_6000	Hey mister—if you ever see the berserk Pokémon, tell\nthem to stop, OK?!
A4_1505_HARRY_100_6000	Heh. Sure thing, kiddo. I’ll let ’em know.
A4_1510_HARRY_100_1000	It’s bamboo charcoal. Bamboo Borough’s famous\nfor it.
A4_1515_HARRY_100_1000	All right! I’ll go see the master of the charcoal shop\nand convince him to let me borrow the key.
A4_1515_HARRY_100_2000	I sure hope he’s open to being convinced...
A4_1520_HARRY_100_1000	To open this gate, I need to borrow the key from the\nmaster of the charcoal shop.
A4_1525_HARRY_100_1000	Hey there, do you have a minute?
A4_1525_CHARCOALMASTER_100_1000	Oh, it’s you again. I’m still not handin’ over the key!
A4_1525_HARRY_100_2000	I know. I’m actually here to talk about the elevator in\nthe storage area. I heard it breaks down a lot.
A4_1525_CHARCOALMASTER_100_2000	Sure does, an’ I’m always the one who’s gotta fix it...\nWait, it ain’t gone and broke itself again, has it?
A4_1525_CHARCOALMASTER_100_3000	Keep ME in the dark again, will they? Why I oughta—\nUrrrgh! My back...
A4_1525_HARRY_100_3000	Easy there! They didn’t tell you because they all want\nyou to rest.
A4_1525_HARRY_100_4000	Now...how do you usually fix it?
A4_1525_CHARCOALMASTER_100_4000	Oh, I jus’ give it a few whacks with some bamboo.\nIt’s like playin’ the drums!
A4_1525_HARRY_100_5000	Seriously? No wonder the elevator keeps breaking.\nYour back’s never gonna heal if you keep that up.
A4_1525_HARRY_100_6000	I’ll go fix the elevator.
A4_1525_CHARCOALMASTER_100_5000	An amateur like you wouldn’t know the first thing\nabout fixin’ elevators. Stay out of it.
A4_1525_HARRY_100_7000	Hey, I might not seem like it, but I’m pretty good\nwith machines.
A4_1525_HARRY_100_8000	I even fix my own car when it needs work.
A4_1525_CHARCOALMASTER_100_6000	Is that right? Hmmm...
A4_1525_CHARCOALMASTER_100_7000	You SURE you can fix it?
A4_1525_HARRY_100_9000	I’ll at least do better than hitting it with bamboo!
A4_1525_HARRY_100_10000	Whaddya say?
A4_1525_CHARCOALMASTER_100_8000	Hmph! Fine, take the key. I’d rather suffer my back\nthan you right now anyway...
A4_1525_CHARCOALMASTER_100_9000	I figure you’ll do some investigatin’ while you’re in the\nbamboo forest. You meet with any danger in there,\nyou better run for it, hear me?
A4_1525_HARRY_100_11000	Sure thing. Thanks!
A4_1535_HARRY_100_1000	Just gotta put the key in here, and—huh. This gate is\nsurprisingly heavy.
A4_1535_HARRY_100_2000	All right, it’s open!
A4_1545_HARRY_100_1000	Huh? It’s so quiet here... Not even the slightest sign\nof a Pokémon.
A4_1545_HARRY_100_2000	All right, let’s see what I can find!
A4_1550_HARRY_100_1000	Whoa! Didn’t expect to find something so soon.
A4_1555_HARRY_100_1000	The berserk Pokémon came all the way here, huh...\nThe ol’ charcoal master was right to lock the gate.
A4_1555_HARRY_100_2000	OK, let’s see what I can find.
A4_1565_HARRY_100_1000	These footprints paint a clear picture of what went\ndown here.
A4_1565_HARRY_100_2000	Gotta make sure not to miss anything.
A4_1570_HARRY_5000_1000	I should focus on investigating this area first.
A4_1575_HARRY_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>Pokémon footprints—big ones and small ones.</color>
A4_1575_HARRY_100_2000	Judging by the depth of the big ones, the Pokémon\nthat planted them must’ve been heavy.
A4_1575_HARRY_100_3000	Looks like the bigger footprints keep going straight\ndown this path.
A4_1575_HARRY_100_4000	As for the smaller footprints, there are a LOT of them,\nstrangely enough.
A4_1575_HARRY_100_5000	Looks like they round the corner up ahead and\ncontinue toward a side path.
A4_1580_HARRY_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>I see scorches on the ground—a big one and a\nsmall one.</color>
A4_1580_HARRY_100_2000	The nearby grass and bamboo don’t look burned,\nthough. Doesn’t seem like there was a fire.
A4_1580_HARRY_100_3000	Maybe the scorches were made by an\nElectric-type move.
A4_1585_HARRY_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>You’d need a lot of force to leave scratch marks that\ndeep. Could they have been made by some kind of\nmachine? No...maybe a Pokémon’s claw?</color>
A4_1590_HARRY_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>Broken bamboo stalks. Looks like they all broke\nat once.</color>
A4_1590_HARRY_100_2000	Based on the coloration of the cross-sections, this\nlikely happened this morning.
A4_1600_HARRY_100_1000	That’s all there is to see here.
A4_1610_HARRY_100_1000	There’s still something I need to do.
A4_1615_HARRY_100_1000	If I follow the footprints of those two Pokémon...
A4_1615_HARRY_100_2000	I should be able to get some clarity on what went\ndown here.
A4_1615_HARRY_100_3000	I just hope it’ll lead me to the berserk Pokémon...
A4_1620_HARRY_100_1000	This path is also blocked by bamboo. I’ll check it out\nafter I help Pancham.
A4_1640_HARRY_100_1000	Hm? Did something just move?
A4_1650_DIRTENG_100_1000	Shift.
A4_1650_HARRY_100_1000	Oh, it’s a Shiftry. You scared me, pal!
A4_1650_HARRY_100_2000	Or maybe I scared it?
A4_1650_DIRTENG_100_2000	Shift shift!
A4_1650_HARRY_100_3000	Hey, my bad. I’ll be careful next time.
A4_1655_DIRTENG_100_1000	Shiftry.
A4_1655_HARRY_100_1000	Sorry to bug you while you’re resting. I’m just here to\ninvestigate the area.
A4_1660_HARRY_100_1000	I think I heard something just now.
A4_1670_PINPUKU_100_1000	Hap hap!
A4_1670_HARRY_100_1000	It’s a Happiny.
A4_1670_HARRY_100_2000	That thing you’re holding is an Oval Stone, right? Not\nan egg?
A4_1670_PINPUKU_100_2000	Happiii hap!
A4_1670_HARRY_100_3000	Oh, you’re giving it to me? Thanks! You’re one\ngenerous Pokémon.
A4_1670_PINPUKU_200_1000	Hap!
A4_1670_HARRY_200_1000	Hey, you seem to be doin’ well! Already found\nyourself a new Oval Stone, I see.
A4_1675_HARRY_100_1000	What’s this hole? Lemme see... Looks pretty deep.
A4_1675_HARRY_100_2000	I used to poke around in holes like this when I was a\nkid. I remember looking inside ’em for Diglett.
A4_1685_HARRY_100_1000	I guess there were two Pokémon that made the\nsmaller footprints. Looks like Pancham’s injured too.
A4_1685_HARRY_100_2000	I’m gonna take a look—and try not to tick off that\nPikachu even more while I’m at it.
A4_1690_HARRY_100_1000	I won’t hurt you. I’m just gonna take a look.
A4_1695_HARRY_5000_1000	I should focus on investigating this area first.
A4_1700_HARRY_100_1000	Pikachu is protecting Pancham. It looks pretty worked\nup... Guess it doesn’t like humans.
A4_1700_HARRY_100_2000	That’s right! It would make sense if the scorch marks\nI saw on the ground earlier were caused by this\nPikachu using an Electric-type move.
A4_1700_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Pika pika!
A4_1705_HARRY_100_1000	Pancham looks exhausted—and it’s injured too.\nIt must be feeling pretty lousy.
A4_1705_HARRY_100_2000	Those small footprints I saw earlier must’ve been\nPancham and Pikachu’s.
A4_1705_HARRY_100_3000	They were probably attacked by a big Pokémon...
A4_1705_YANCHAM_100_1000	Pancha...
A4_1710_HARRY_100_1000	Seems like it can’t move its arms and legs too well...\nMaybe it’s paralyzed.
A4_1720_HARRY_100_1000	OK, I have a good sense of what’s going on with\nthese Pokémon now.
A4_1730_HARRY_100_1000	Pancham’s low on energy—and paralyzed too. It’s in\nworse shape than I thought...
A4_1735_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Pika! Piiika!
A4_1735_HARRY_100_1000	Pancham’ll be safe with Pikachu. I’ll go look for\nsomething that can heal it.
A4_1737_BHBOY01_100_1000	Is something wrong?
A4_1737_HARRY_100_1000	I found an injured Pokémon. Do you know where I\ncan get something to heal it?
A4_1737_BHBOY01_100_2000	You should go to the herbal remedy shop! Their stuff\nworks for everything!
A4_1737_HARRY_100_2000	Hey, yeah! Herbal medicine might just do the trick. I’ll\nhead over there now. Thanks!
A4_1739_HARRY_100_1000	Hey, kiddo! I heard your dad owns the herbal\nremedy shop.
A4_1739_BHBOY01_100_1000	You visited our shop, huh? Find anything good?
A4_1739_HARRY_100_2000	Yeah, I got some Heal Powder.
A4_1739_HARRY_100_3000	They were out of Energy Roots, though.
A4_1739_BHBOY01_100_2000	Ohhh, Energy Roots! There’s a trick to finding those.
A4_1739_HARRY_100_4000	So I’ve heard. Could you give me some pointers?\nI need to find one to help an injured Pokémon.
A4_1739_BHBOY01_100_3000	Umm, sooo... You go inside the bamboo forest, right,\nand then the Energy Roots aaare...
A4_1739_HARRY_100_5000	The Energy Roots aaare...where?
A4_1739_BHBOY01_100_4000	I dunno... Should I really share my secret? It’s kinda\ncool being the only one who can find ’em.
A4_1739_BHBOY01_100_5000	How ’bout this—I’ll tell you if you can get me an\nOval Stone!
A4_1739_HARRY_300_3000	Is this what you’re lookin’ for?
A4_1739_BHBOY01_300_1000	Yeah! That’s it!
A4_1739_HARRY_300_4000	Let’s consider it a symbol of our friendship. Take good\ncare of it, OK?
A4_1739_BHBOY01_300_2000	I will! Thank you!
A4_1739_BHBOY01_300_3000	I’ll tell you my secret to finding Energy Roots now.\nBehold!
A4_1739_HARRY_300_5000	A Berry?
A4_1739_BHBOY01_300_4000	Yep, a Nanab Berry. It’s Bunnelby’s favorite.
A4_1739_BHBOY01_300_5000	If you see a hole in the ground, try holding one of\nthese near it.
A4_1739_BHBOY01_300_6000	Bunnelby will smell the Berry and come out. Once it\ndoes, look inside the hole.
A4_1739_HARRY_300_6000	That’s where the Energy Roots are, huh? All right, I’ll\ngive it a shot. Thanks!
A4_1739_BHBOY01_300_7000	Good luck, mister! I hope you can help that injured\nPokémon.
A4_1739_HARRY_400_1000	Really, kid? You’re gonna play hardball with me?\n*sigh* Fine, I’ll get you an Oval Stone.
A4_1739_HARRY_400_2000	Where does one find an Oval Stone, anyway?
A4_1739_BHBOY01_400_1000	Happiny has them.
A4_1739_BHBOY01_400_2000	If you see a bush moving in the bamboo forest,\nsometimes a Happiny will come out.
A4_1739_HARRY_400_3000	A bush in the bamboo forest, huh? OK, I’ll keep my\neyes peeled.
A4_1740_BHBOY01_100_1000	Do you have an Oval Stone?
A4_1740_HARRY_300_1000	Is this what you’re lookin’ for?
A4_1740_BHBOY01_300_1000	Yeah! That’s it!
A4_1740_HARRY_300_2000	Let’s consider it a symbol of our friendship. Take good\ncare of it, OK?
A4_1740_BHBOY01_300_2000	I will! Thank you!
A4_1740_BHBOY01_300_3000	I’ll tell you my secret to finding Energy Roots now.\nBehold!
A4_1740_HARRY_300_3000	A Berry?
A4_1740_BHBOY01_300_4000	Yep, a Nanab Berry. It’s Bunnelby’s favorite.
A4_1740_BHBOY01_300_5000	If you see a hole in the ground, try holding one of\nthese near it.
A4_1740_BHBOY01_300_6000	Bunnelby will smell the Berry and come out. Once it\ndoes, look inside the hole.
A4_1740_HARRY_300_4000	That’s where the Energy Roots are, huh? All right, I’ll\ngive it a shot. Thanks!
A4_1740_BHBOY01_300_7000	Good luck, mister! I hope you can help that injured\nPokémon.
A4_1740_HARRY_400_1000	Really, kid? You’re gonna play hardball with me?\n*sigh* Fine, I’ll get you an Oval Stone.
A4_1740_HARRY_400_2000	Where does one find an Oval Stone, anyway?
A4_1740_BHBOY01_400_1000	Happiny has them.
A4_1740_BHBOY01_400_2000	If you see a bush moving in the bamboo forest,\nsometimes a Happiny will come out.
A4_1740_HARRY_400_3000	A bush in the bamboo forest, huh? OK, I’ll keep my\neyes peeled.
A4_1745_BHBOY01_100_1000	Thanks for the Oval Stone.
A4_1745_HARRY_100_1000	Sure thing. Thank you for your help!
A4_1750_HARRY_100_1000	A hole in the ground... Is this it? If this works,\nBunnelby should come out.
A4_1760_HORUBEE_100_1000	Bunnel!
A4_1760_HARRY_100_1000	Whoa! Scared me. It popped out before I could even\ntake out the Nanab Berry.
A4_1760_HORUBEE_100_2000	*sniff sniff* Bun?!
A4_1760_HARRY_100_2000	Hey, hey! Don’t go shovin’ your ear in my pocket!
A4_1760_HARRY_100_3000	Wha?!
A4_1760_HORUBEE_100_3000	Bun!
A4_1760_HARRY_100_4000	You took my Nanab Berry... Oh well, guess it was\nmeant for you anyway.
A4_1760_HARRY_100_5000	You take that, and <color=#F39800FF>I’ll take a look in this hole</color>.
A4_1760_HARRY_100_6000	It’s pretty deep... Hm?
A4_1760_HARRY_100_7000	There’s something in here. One, two...
A4_1760_HARRY_100_8000	Three!
A4_1760_HARRY_100_9000	<color=#F39800FF>Whoa, look at its shape! This is definitely an\nEnergy Root.</color>
A4_1760_HORUBEE_200_1000	Bunnel!
A4_1760_HARRY_200_1000	Thanks for the assist, bud.
A4_1765_HARRY_100_1000	This is a pretty deep burrow, by the way. I wonder\nwhat it connects to?
A4_1765_HARRY_100_2000	It might be a little tight, but I could probably fit in\nhere. I’d love to explore it properly, given the time.
A4_1770_HARRY_100_1000	All right, I’ve got all the medicine I need to\nheal Pancham!
A4_1775_HARRY_100_1000	Sorry for the wait! I brought you some medicine.
A4_1775_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Pika pika!
A4_1775_HARRY_100_2000	Nice job keepin’ Pancham safe, Pikachu!
A4_1790_HARRY_100_1000	A Pokémon roar? Sounds like it came from the far\nend of the forest.
A4_1790_HARRY_100_2000	Am I finally gonna meet this berserk Pokémon?!
A4_1795_HARRY_100_1000	That’s not where the Pokémon’s roar came from.\nI need to find the berserk Pokémon fast, or I’ll be\nputting the whole neighborhood in danger!
A4_1800_YANCHAM_100_1000	Pancha.
A4_1800_HARRY_100_1000	Nice one, Pancham! I can tell you’re feelin’ better.\nWay to hang in there.
A4_1800_YANCHAM_200_1000	Pancha.
A4_1800_HARRY_200_1000	Nice one, Pancham! I can tell you’re feelin’ better.\nWay to hang in there.
A4_1805_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Piiika. Pikachu!
A4_1805_HARRY_100_1000	You gotta at least trust me a little now, right?
A4_1805_PIKACHUO_200_1000	Piiika. Pikachu!
A4_1805_HARRY_200_1000	You gotta at least trust me a little now, right?
A4_1807_SECRETKODORA_100_1000	Laaaaaaiiirrr!
A4_1820_HARRY_100_1000	I’ll check out this area and see if I can get through to\nthe other side.
A4_1830_HARRY_100_1000	Let’s see...
A4_1835_HARRY_5000_1000	I should focus on investigating this area first.
A4_1840_HARRY_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>These bamboo stalks are broken in the same way as\nthe ones by the entrance. The breaks seems pretty\nfresh too.</color>
A4_1840_HARRY_100_2000	With so many fallen bamboo stalks blocking the way,\nI don’t think there’s any space for me to get through.
A4_1845_HARRY_100_1000	These footprints are the same as the ones I saw by the\nentrance. It seems safe to assume they were made by\nthe berserk Pokémon.
A4_1845_HARRY_100_2000	It’ll be difficult to follow these footprints with so many\nbamboo stalks in the way.
A4_1855_HARRY_100_1000	I think that’s all there is to see here.
A4_1865_HARRY_100_1000	Now that I’m getting a proper look, this is quite\nthe sight.
A4_1875_HARRY_100_1000	Doesn’t seem like there’s much to see here, but you\nnever know till you look! I’ll go ahead and investigate.
A4_1880_HARRY_5000_1000	I should focus on investigating this area first.
A4_1885_HARRY_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>This huge boulder must’ve broke apart when it fell\ndown here. Now it’s more like a cliff face.</color>
A4_1885_HARRY_100_2000	Hmm... This boulder’s pretty tough. I don’t think it’ll\nbreak apart any further.
A4_1890_HARRY_100_1000	This looks like it used to be a path up the hill, but it’s\nbeen completely eroded.
A4_1890_HARRY_100_2000	I’m not sure if this boulder fell naturally or the berserk\nPokémon knocked it loose, but either way, I’m glad\nno one was hurt.
A4_1900_HARRY_100_1000	I think that’s all there is to see here.
A4_19001_TIM_100_1000	These are the medals we received.
A4_19001_PIKACHU_100_1000	They’re proof of all the good we’ve done with our\ngreat detective work. Let’s keep it up, Tim!
A4_19010_TIM_100_1000	It’s a tourist map for Bamboo Borough.
A4_19010_TIM_100_2000	Looks like this neighborhood is laid out in a\nstraight line.
A4_19010_PIKACHU_100_1000	That makes it easy for us to navigate. Judging by the\nmap, we’re at the far-right end of the neighborhood.
A4_19010_TIM_100_3000	Yeah, we won’t get lost as long as we stay on\nthis street.
A4_19015_HARRY_100_1000	It’s Bamboo Borough’s tourist map.
A4_19015_HARRY_100_2000	Exactly what it says on the tin—a cozy little\nneighborhood surrounded by bamboo.
A4_19020_TIM_100_1000	It’s a sign that says “This Month’s Bamboo News.”
A4_19020_TIM_100_2000	“The Bamboo Arts & Crafts Fair is returning this year!\nCome enjoy a variety of bamboo-rific artisanal goods,\nincluding furniture, dolls, and much, much more!”
A4_19020_PIKACHU_100_1000	Who knew this place hosted events like that! I wanna\ncheck it out.
A4_19020_TIM_100_3000	Me too. We need to come back next month!
A4_19025_HARRY_100_1000	Let’s see what this sign says... Oh, it’s this month’s\nBamboo News.
A4_19025_HARRY_100_2000	“Attention! Due to the appearance of berserk\nPokémon, the Bamboo Forest Stroll is postponed\nuntil further notice.”
A4_19025_HARRY_100_3000	This berserk Pokémon incident has really put a\ndamper on this neighborhood, huh...
A4_1910_HARRY_100_1000	Hmmm... I wonder if Bunnelby’s burrow is connected\nto wherever the berserk Pokémon is.
A4_1910_HARRY_100_2000	Only one way to find out, right?
A4_1915_HARRY_100_1000	If I climb up the boulder, I should find a path.
A4_1915_HARRY_100_2000	Getting back down might be tough, though...\nEh, I’ll figure that out later.
A4_1915_HARRY_100_3000	Time to get climbing!
A4_1920_HARRY_100_1000	There’s bamboo blocking my way here, but I can\nprobably find my way to a path if I climb the boulder.
A4_1926_HARRY_100_1000	Phew... Been a while since I did something like this.\nI’m definitely out of shape.
A4_1926_HARRY_100_2000	There’s that path! This oughta lead me closer to the\nberserk Pokémon.
A4_1930_HARRY_100_1000	Is this the entrance to the storage area? If so, I need\nto fix the elevator in there.
A4_1930_HARRY_100_2000	But first I gotta find the berserk Pokémon!
A4_1935_HARRY_100_1000	I need to find the berserk Pokémon first! I feel bad for\nmaking the master of the charcoal shop wait, but I’ll\nhave to deal with the elevator later.
A4_20110_TIM_100_1000	What is it, Pikachu?
A4_20110_SEL_0_1000	I’m ready to get off of Pangoro
A4_20110_SEL_0_2000	It’s nothing important
A4_20110_TIM_400_1000	Be careful getting down.
A4_20110_PIKACHU_400_1000	Thanks for your help, Pangoro.
A4_20110_TIM_500_1000	OK. Be careful up there.
A4_20120_GORONDA_100_1000	(Are there rocks I need to move over that way too?)
A4_20120_PIKACHU_100_1000	Ah, whoops—my bad. No need to go that way.
A4_20130_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s investigate this area when Tim’s here.
A4_20130_GORONDA_100_1000	(OK.)
A4_20140_PIKACHU_100_1000	The bridge is broken. I’ll leave investigating this area\nto Tim.
A4_20150_DIRTENG_100_1000	(Bwahahaha! You must be that young’un from way\nback when.)
A4_20150_GORONDA_100_1000	(You talking about me?)
A4_20150_DIRTENG_100_2000	(Indeed, indeed. You’ve really grown up, haven’t ya.)
A4_20150_DIRTENG_100_3000	(And you, with the yellow fur...)
A4_20150_PIKACHU_100_1000	Uhhh... Y-yeah?
A4_20150_DIRTENG_100_4000	(You haven’t changed much since that time I saw ya\nwith Pancham.)
A4_20150_PIKACHU_100_2000	What’s it going on about?
A4_20160_DIRTENG_100_1000	(Look how big you are now.)
A4_20170_LUCKY_100_1000	(That scream was quite startling, wasn’t it?)
A4_20170_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, that was one of our friends. We’re trying to find\nthem now.
A4_20170_LUCKY_100_2000	(Oh my, that’s eggs-tremely concerning! I haven’t seen\nanyone come this way, though.)
A4_20170_PIKACHU_100_2000	Darn. Well, thanks anyway!
A4_20170_LUCKY_100_3000	(Are you helping Pikachu?)
A4_20170_GORONDA_100_1000	(Yeah. After all he’s done for me, I owe him big time.)
A4_20170_LUCKY_100_4000	(Is that so? Then I suppose this is your way of\nthanking him.)
A4_20170_GORONDA_100_2000	(I guess you could say that.)
A4_20170_LUCKY_100_5000	(Be careful out there. I hope today’s your chance for\nsomething special.)
A4_20170_PIKACHU_100_3000	Thanks, Chansey.
A4_20180_LUCKY_100_1000	(Be careful out there. I hope today’s your chance for\nsomething special.)
A4_20180_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thanks, Chansey.
A4_20183_TAMAGETAKE_200_1000	(Wah! Don’t eat meee!)
A4_20183_PIKACHU_200_1000	Don’t worry. He won’t eat you...I think.
A4_20183_GORONDA_200_1000	(You “think”? Don’t say that—it’s already scared.\nFoongus, I’m not gonna eat you. Promise.)
A4_20185_TAMAGETAKE_100_1000	(Wah! Don’t eat meee!)
A4_20185_PIKACHU_100_1000	Don’t worry. He won’t eat you...I think.
A4_20185_GORONDA_100_1000	(You “think”? Don’t say that—it’s already scared.\nFoongus, I’m not gonna eat you. Promise.)
A4_20187_GORONDA_100_1000	(You want me to move one of these rocks, right? Can\nI go ahead and get started?)
A4_20187_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_20187_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_20187_PIKACHU_300_1000	Do your thing, Pangoro!
A4_20187_GORONDA_300_1000	(Right!)
A4_20187_PIKACHU_400_1000	Could you hold on for a sec?
A4_20187_GORONDA_400_1000	(Sure.)
A4_20190_PIKACHU_100_1000	All right, the path’s clear now! You’ve been a huge\nhelp, Pangoro.
A4_20190_GORONDA_100_1000	(Heh. Stuff like that’s a piece of cake.)
A4_20190_TIM_100_1000	Thank you both!
A4_20190_TIM_100_2000	I’m gonna head over to the bridge now. There’s no\ntime to lose!
A4_20190_TIM_100_3000	Rachel, Jessica—I’m on my way!
A4_20190_PIKACHU_100_2000	We should head that way too.
A4_20190_GORONDA_100_2000	(All right.)
A4_20200_GORONDA_100_1000	(Want me to move this rock too?)
A4_20200_PIKACHU_100_1000	Nah, no need.
A4_20240_BHMAN01_100_1000	Whoaaa! It’s a Pangoro!
A4_20240_PIKACHU_100_1000	Whoops, watch out for that kid.
A4_20240_GORONDA_100_1000	(Don’t worry. I won’t step on him.)
A4_20246_TIM_100_1000	Pikachu, look. What do we do?
A4_20246_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, I see it. Just gimme a sec.
A4_20246_PIKACHU_100_2000	Thanks, Pangoro. You can put me down now.
A4_20246_GORONDA_100_1000	(OK.)
A4_20246_TIM_100_2000	The bridge is broken.
A4_20246_PIKACHU_100_3000	Those rocks must’ve smashed it.
A4_20250_TIM_100_1000	What is it, Pikachu?
A4_20250_SEL_0_1000	I’m ready to get off of Pangoro
A4_20250_SEL_0_2000	It’s nothing important
A4_20250_TIM_400_1000	Be careful getting down.
A4_20250_PIKACHU_400_1000	Thanks for your help, Pangoro.
A4_20250_TIM_500_1000	OK. Be careful up there.
A4_20260_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s up this hill!
A4_20265_PIKACHU_100_1000	This is it! We can get to the other side of the bridge\nfrom here!
A4_20265_GORONDA_100_1000	(Interesting. Didn’t know that.)
A4_20270_PIKACHU_100_1000	If we’re gonna head in now, I’ll go get Tim first.
A4_20270_SEL_0_1000	Let’s get Tim
A4_20270_SEL_0_2000	Wait
A4_20270_PIKACHU_200_1000	OK, I’m gonna call Tim over and then we’ll head in.
A4_20270_GORONDA_200_1000	(Right!)
A4_20270_PIKACHU_200_2000	This is it—we can get to the charcoal kiln from here!
A4_20270_TIM_200_1000	Nice work, Pikachu! But how did you know about this?
A4_20270_PIKACHU_200_3000	I’ve gone this way before.
A4_20270_TIM_200_2000	... ... ...
A4_20270_TIM_200_3000	OK, Pikachu, I trust you. Let’s go!
A4_20270_PIKACHU_200_4000	All right. Here we go!
A4_20270_PIKACHU_200_5000	Actually, could you put me down before we do\nthat, Pangoro?
A4_20270_PIKACHU_200_6000	I think I’ll hit my head if I stay up here.
A4_20270_GORONDA_200_2000	(Sure.)
A4_20270_TIM_200_4000	All right, let’s go inside.
A4_20270_PIKACHU_300_1000	Lemme take a minute to think before we go in. There\nmight be something I still need to do out here.
A4_20310_TIM_100_1000	What is it, Pikachu?
A4_20310_SEL_0_1000	I’m ready to get off of Pangoro
A4_20310_SEL_0_2000	It’s nothing important
A4_20310_TIM_300_1000	Be careful getting down.
A4_20310_PIKACHU_300_1000	Thanks for your help, Pangoro.
A4_20310_TIM_400_1000	OK. Be careful up there.
A4_20315_GORONDA_100_1000	(You want me to push these rocks, right? Mind if I\nget to it?)
A4_20315_SEL_0_1000	Go for it
A4_20315_SEL_0_2000	Wait
A4_20315_PIKACHU_300_1000	Do your thing, Pangoro!
A4_20315_GORONDA_300_1000	(OK!)
A4_20315_PIKACHU_400_1000	Could you hold on for a sec?
A4_20315_GORONDA_400_1000	(OK.)
A4_20317_PIKACHU_100_1000	Nice! Now we can keep going. Thanks for the\nassist, Pangoro!
A4_20317_GORONDA_100_1000	(Sure. If you need any more help, just say the word.)
A4_20330_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, it’s Diggersby. What’re you doing in a place\nlike this?
A4_20330_HORUDO_100_1000	(I’m working on my artistic creations! Dig it!)
A4_20330_PIKACHU_100_2000	Whaddya mean?
A4_20330_HORUDO_100_2000	(All these nice rock blocks I made today! They’re my\npride and joy, you dig? Don’t they look great?)
A4_20330_GORONDA_100_1000	(You mean you’re the one who dug up those holes\nand left all those boulders lying around?)
A4_20330_HORUDO_100_3000	(I sure dig! Hope you enjoyed ’em!)
A4_20330_PIKACHU_100_3000	Uh... “Enjoy” isn’t the first word that comes to mind...
A4_20330_GORONDA_100_2000	(We filled those holes. They were in the way.)
A4_20330_HORUDO_100_4000	(You dig WHAT?! You ruined my precious artistic\ncreations?!)
A4_20330_PIKACHU_100_4000	Sorry, but we didn’t have a choice—it was our only\nway through.
A4_20330_HORUDO_100_5000	(Dignabbit...)
A4_20330_GORONDA_100_3000	(Let’s go, Pikachu...)
A4_20330_PIKACHU_100_5000	Uhhh... Y-yeah. That’s probably a good idea.
A4_20340_HORUDO_100_1000	(I really dug my creations... Oh well! Just means I’ll\nhave to make ’em even better next time!)
A4_20340_GORONDA_100_1000	(I really don’t get this guy—or his “art.”)
A4_20340_PIKACHU_100_1000	Next time make ’em a bit smaller, would ya?
A4_20350_HORUDO_100_1000	(What’d you think of my precious artistic creations?\nWouldn’t you say those blocks look pretty great?)
A4_20350_GORONDA_100_1000	(What’s it yammering about?)
A4_20350_PIKACHU_100_1000	Y’know those holes and rocks that were in our way?\nI guess to Diggersby here, they were works of art.
A4_20350_GORONDA_100_2000	(So you’re the one who left that stuff lying around...)
A4_20353_GORONDA_100_1000	(You want me to move these rocks too, right? Mind\nif I get started?)
A4_20353_SEL_0_1000	Go for it
A4_20353_SEL_0_2000	Wait
A4_20353_PIKACHU_300_1000	Do your thing, Pangoro!
A4_20353_GORONDA_300_1000	(OK!)
A4_20353_PIKACHU_400_1000	Could you hold on for a sec?
A4_20353_GORONDA_400_1000	(Sure.)
A4_20355_PIKACHU_100_1000	All right, the path’s clear! Thanks, Pangoro.
A4_20355_GORONDA_100_1000	(Don’t mention it.)
A4_20356_TIM_100_1000	Thank you both!
A4_20356_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like we can continue now.
A4_20357_TIM_100_1000	What is it, Pikachu?
A4_20357_SEL_0_1000	I’m ready to get off of Pangoro
A4_20357_SEL_0_2000	It’s nothing important
A4_20357_TIM_300_1000	Be careful getting down.
A4_20357_PIKACHU_300_1000	Thanks for your help, Pangoro.
A4_20357_TIM_400_1000	OK. Be careful up there.
A4_20360_PIKACHU_100_1000	The elevator’s power unit looks like it’s working\nproperly. What a relief!
A4_20360_GORONDA_100_1000	(Want me to move this too?)
A4_20360_PIKACHU_100_2000	No, no, no! Don’t you worry about that!
A4_20370_PIKACHU_100_1000	These must be the elevator buttons. Let’s get Tim over\nhere before we press anything.
A4_20370_GORONDA_100_1000	(All right.)
A4_2220_TIM_100_1000	Phew... You’re awake!
A4_2220_PIKACHU_100_1000	Ah, yeah... Tim?
A4_2220_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hmm... Guess I fell asleep.
A4_2220_TIM_100_2000	Hey, Pikachu? This isn’t the first time that’s\nhappened...
A4_2220_TIM_100_3000	Maybe you should get yourself checked out.
A4_2220_PIKACHU_100_3000	Whoa, whoa! I doze off for a bit, and you’re acting\nlike I’m about to keel over or something?
A4_2220_TIM_100_4000	That’s not what I meant, but...OK, sorry.
A4_2220_PIKACHU_100_4000	It’s fine. Anyway, I just remembered...
A4_2220_PIKACHU_100_5000	I’ve been here before—a long time ago.
A4_2220_TIM_100_5000	Huh?
A4_2220_TIM_100_6000	What do you mean?
A4_2220_SEL_0_1000	You just remembered this place?
A4_2220_SEL_0_2000	You borrowed the key to the gate?
A4_2220_SEL_0_3000	You battled a Lairon?
A4_2220_SEL_0_4000	You met Dad here?
A4_2220_TIM_300_1000	What do you remember, Pikachu?
A4_2220_PIKACHU_300_1000	I came all the way to Bamboo Borough after hearing\nabout the berserk Pokémon.
A4_2220_PIKACHU_300_2000	While I was here, I borrowed a gate key from the\ncharcoal shop master, I battled a Lairon, and, uh...
A4_2220_PIKACHU_300_3000	Oh yeah! The bamboo forest is also where Harry and I\nfirst met!
A4_2220_PIKACHU_300_4000	Takes me back.
A4_2220_TIM_300_2000	You borrowed a key and met my dad?
A4_2220_RACHEL_300_1000	Hey, did something happen to Pikachu? He fainted\nearlier, but now he’s acting like nothing’s wrong.
A4_2220_TIM_300_3000	Errr, yeah—he’s fine! I think...
A4_2220_PIKACHU_300_5000	Who, me? Never been better!
A4_2220_TIM_300_4000	I’ve got a few more questions...
A4_2220_TIM_400_1000	What do you mean, you borrowed the key to\nthe gate?
A4_2220_PIKACHU_400_1000	I came to this town because I heard that a Pokémon\nhad gone berserk in the bamboo forest.
A4_2220_PIKACHU_400_2000	But I couldn’t get into the forest to investigate like I\nwanted because the gate was locked.
A4_2220_PIKACHU_400_3000	<color=#F39800FF>The charcoal shop master had the key—but man, was\nhe stubborn! Getting him to lend it to me was no\nsmall feat.</color>
A4_2220_TIM_400_2000	YOU borrowed the key from the charcoal shop\nmaster?
A4_2220_PIKACHU_400_4000	Yeah, in exchange for fixing the elevator.
A4_2220_TIM_400_3000	I guess you do need a key to open this gate,\nbut...hrm.
A4_2220_TIM_500_1000	Did you really battle a Lairon last time you\nwere here?
A4_2220_PIKACHU_500_1000	Yep—battled it twice in the bamboo forest! Once\nwhen I saved Pancham, and then again when I saved\nHarry.
A4_2220_PIKACHU_500_2000	That Lairon did NOT know when to quit—it just kept\ncoming at us. <color=#F39800FF>But I hit it with my Electric-type moves!</color>
A4_2220_TIM_500_2000	(Pikachu used his Electric-type moves?)
A4_2220_TIM_500_3000	(Maybe he could still use them back then?)
A4_2220_TIM_600_1000	So, about the first time you met Dad...
A4_2220_PIKACHU_600_1000	That was back when I was investigating the bamboo\nforest. I’d found some footprints...
A4_2220_PIKACHU_600_2000	And then, <color=#F39800FF>I crossed a river to get into the bamboo\nforest and wound up living there for a while</color>.
A4_2220_PIKACHU_600_3000	When I saw Harry, <color=#F39800FF>I jumped out ’cause I thought he\nwas dangerous</color>.
A4_2220_TIM_600_2000	Hmm? I get that’s where you two met, but...huh.
A4_2220_TIM_600_3000	I’m not quite sure I can make sense of your story.
A4_2225_TIM_100_1000	Seems like a lot happened when Pikachu and Dad\nfirst met.
A4_2225_TIM_100_2000	But some of these pieces aren’t quite fitting together.\nI’ll have to organize all this information.
A4_2230_RACHEL_100_1000	Is Pikachu OK? He fainted at dinner the other day\ntoo. I’m starting to worry.
A4_2230_TIM_100_1000	He says he’s fine...but he also fell unconscious after\nhe got back from the police station last night.
A4_2230_TIM_100_2000	He’s been acting weird lately, and the things he’s\nsaying don’t seem to add up.
A4_2230_RACHEL_100_2000	Really? Maybe he’s confused—he did just wake up,\nafter all.
A4_2230_TIM_100_3000	I hope that’s all it is...
A4_2230_RACHEL_200_1000	I hope Pikachu is OK.
A4_2230_TIM_200_1000	I feel like he’s been acting strange... He says he’s fine,\nthough.
A4_2240_JESSICA_100_1000	Tim, don’t worry about helping me. You should stay\nwith Pikachu here.
A4_2240_JESSICA_100_2000	I can bring back the bamboo charcoal and ingredients\nmyself.
A4_2240_TIM_100_1000	OK, thank you.
A4_2240_TIM_100_2000	(I don’t want to worry Jessica over what’s going on\nwith Pikachu... I’ll just keep it to myself.)
A4_2240_JESSICA_200_1000	Don’t push yourselves too hard, OK?
A4_2240_TIM_200_1000	(I’ve got a lot on my mind right now, but nothing\nI need to concern Jessica with.)
A4_2250_TIM_100_1000	I should probably try making sense of everything\nPikachu told me before we enter the bamboo forest.
A4_2260_TIM_100_1000	It’s a warning sign about berserk Pokémon in the area.\nIf this sign went up because of the R incident, that’d\nmake it about two years old.
A4_2270_TIM_100_1000	Are you sure you’re all right, Pikachu? Shouldn’t you\nstay behind and get some rest?
A4_2270_PIKACHU_100_1000	You worry too much, Tim.
A4_2270_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s help Jessica first, then ask questions later.
A4_2270_PIKACHU_100_3000	As long as we stick with Jessica, we’ll be able to\nprotect her if those people who are after her decide\nto show up.
A4_2270_TIM_100_2000	Good call.
A4_2270_TIM_100_3000	All right, Pikachu. Let’s go!
A4_2270_PIKACHU_100_4000	Yeah!
A4_2273_RACHEL_100_1000	Is Pikachu going to be OK?
A4_2273_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, he’s all good now! Thanks for checking in.
A4_2275_JESSICA_100_1000	Let me know right away if Pikachu starts feeling\nill again.
A4_2275_TIM_100_1000	Will do. Thank you.
A4_2280_JESSICA_100_1000	Well then, let’s head inside the bamboo forest.
A4_2290_JESSICA_100_1000	I want to gather ingredients for our daily specials first.\nWould that be all right?
A4_2290_RACHEL_100_1000	Yeah! On the hunt for pizza ingredients... Sounds\nexciting!
A4_2290_JESSICA_100_2000	Our pizza is made from ingredients found in the\nbamboo forest.
A4_2290_JESSICA_100_3000	My manager takes the freshness of our product very\nseriously.
A4_2290_PIKACHU_100_1000	Bamboo Borough’s just full of folks who are dedicated\nto their craft.
A4_2290_JESSICA_100_4000	So, Tim and Pikachu, could you two find me an herb\nand an egg?
A4_2290_TIM_100_1000	Sure thing.
A4_2290_JESSICA_100_5000	Rachel and I will go look for mushrooms and—huh?!
A4_2290_RACHEL_100_2000	What’s wrong?!
A4_2290_JESSICA_100_6000	Look, Rachel! An Energy Root—and it’s BIG!
A4_2290_RACHEL_100_3000	Oh? Why do you sound so excited?
A4_2290_JESSICA_100_7000	Because they’re really hard to find! I usually have to\nask the herbal remedy shop for them...
A4_2290_JESSICA_100_8000	I guess this one got pushed by this boulder and\npopped out!
A4_2290_JESSICA_100_9000	Could you give me a hand, Rachel?
A4_2290_RACHEL_100_4000	It must be a pretty rare find if Jessica’s THIS fired up\nabout it!
A4_2290_TIM_100_2000	In that case, we can go look for the mushrooms too.
A4_2290_JESSICA_100_10000	Thank you, Tim.
A4_2290_JESSICA_100_11000	Though you might not find any—not only are they\nout of season, but mushroom picking is very popular\nright now...
A4_2290_TIM_100_3000	I’ll keep that in mind. OK, Pikachu, let’s go.
A4_2290_PIKACHU_100_2000	So! We just gotta find an herb, an egg, and some\nmushrooms, right? A perfect chance for this great\ndetective to flex his searchin’ muscles!
A4_2300_RACHEL_100_1000	Jessica! Let’s pull on the count of three!
A4_2300_JESSICA_100_1000	OK! One...two...three!
A4_2300_TIM_100_1000	That looks pretty hard to uproot. Sure you don’t\nneed a third set of hands?
A4_2300_RACHEL_100_2000	No thanks, we’re good! We’ve...almost got it!
A4_2300_PIKACHU_100_1000	Those two look like they’re having fun. Let’s go\nsearch for our own ingredients.
A4_2300_RACHEL_200_1000	Phew! We’re so close to getting it out!
A4_2300_PIKACHU_200_1000	C’mon, Tim, we’ve got our own ingredients to find.
A4_2310_JESSICA_100_1000	I need just a few more pizza ingredients—an herb,\nan egg, and a couple of mushrooms.
A4_2310_TIM_100_1000	Got it. Any tips on where to find them?
A4_2310_JESSICA_100_2000	If you see a swaying bush, take a closer look.
A4_2310_JESSICA_100_3000	The Pokémon inside might share something with you.
A4_2310_TIM_100_2000	OK. We’ll keep an eye out for any swaying bushes!
A4_2310_JESSICA_200_1000	I need just a few more pizza ingredients—an herb,\nan egg, and a couple of mushrooms.
A4_2310_TIM_200_1000	Got it. Any tips on where to find them?
A4_2310_JESSICA_200_2000	If you see a swaying bush, take a closer look.
A4_2310_JESSICA_200_3000	The Pokémon inside might share something with you.
A4_2310_TIM_200_2000	OK. We’ll keep an eye out for any swaying bushes!
A4_2320_CHARCOALMASTER_100_1000	Ah, now I remember. You remind me of someone\nI met once.
A4_2320_TIM_100_1000	Really? Who?
A4_2320_CHARCOALMASTER_100_2000	This electrician detective fella who moseyed into our\nneighborhood a few years back. Real skilled sort.
A4_2320_PIKACHU_100_1000	An electrician detective?! What in the world is that?
A4_2320_CHARCOALMASTER_100_3000	He was a brilliant detective—solved the berserk\nPokémon problem goin’ on back then.
A4_2320_CHARCOALMASTER_100_3500	Excellent electrician too. Our elevator used to break\ndown all the time ’fore he fixed it up.
A4_2320_CHARCOALMASTER_100_4000	Elevator’s been runnin’ without any hiccups ever\nsince—all thanks to that electrician detective!
A4_2320_TIM_100_2000	Whoever he was, it sounds like he really knew\nhis stuff...
A4_2320_PIKACHU_100_2000	I can’t even begin to imagine what this guy must’ve\nlooked like...
A4_2320_CHARCOALMASTER_100_5000	You’re an electrician detective too, yeah? I can tell by\nthat Pikachu you got by your side.
A4_2320_TIM_100_3000	I’m a detective, so you’re half right.
A4_2320_CHARCOALMASTER_100_6000	Well, if you ever meet the fella, please let him know...
A4_2320_CHARCOALMASTER_100_7000	Bamboo Borough and all its residents are grateful for\neverything he did.
A4_2330_JESSICA_100_1000	...It’s all thanks to that boulder. It wasn’t here\nyesterday.
A4_2330_RACHEL_100_1000	Are you talking about the Energy Root?
A4_2330_JESSICA_100_2000	Yes. I think this fallen boulder caused the Energy Root\nto pop out.
A4_2330_TIM_100_1000	That makes sense. The boulder’s lodged deep enough\nin the ground that I doubt it rolled here on its own.
A4_2330_PIKACHU_100_1000	It probably landed here after a Pokémon used a\nmove or threw it in a display of strength...or\nsomething like that.
A4_2330_TIM_200_1000	Apparently this boulder wasn’t here yesterday.
A4_2330_PIKACHU_200_1000	It probably landed here after a Pokémon used a\nmove or threw it in a display of strength...or\nsomething like that.
A4_2335_PIKACHU_100_1000	Huh? Something about this place feels familiar...
A4_2335_TIM_100_1000	Did you find something, Pikachu?
A4_2335_PIKACHU_100_2000	Eh, it’s probably nothing.
A4_2335_TIM_100_2000	You sure you’re OK, Pikachu? Do you want to rest?
A4_2335_PIKACHU_100_3000	Nah, don’t worry about me. Looks like there isn’t\nanything for us to find here.
A4_2340_TIM_100_1000	This bush looks like it’s swaying, which means there\nmust be a Pokémon inside...
A4_2360_DIRTENG_100_1000	Shift!
A4_2360_TIM_100_1000	It’s a Shiftry!
A4_2360_PIKACHU_100_1000	I knew they live in wooded areas, but I didn’t know\nthat includes bamboo forests.
A4_2360_TIM_100_2000	It looks like this Shiftry is holding something.
A4_2360_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s see what it has to say... Hey, Shiftry! We’re\nlooking for some pizza ingredients.
A4_2360_DIRTENG_100_2000	Shift.
A4_2360_PIKACHU_100_3000	We’re not the human who normally comes to see you,\nbut you’ll give it to us anyway?
A4_2360_TIM_100_3000	I wonder if that human is Jessica.
A4_2360_PIKACHU_100_4000	It gave me an herb! Mmm, it smells so good. ♪
A4_2360_TIM_100_4000	Thanks, Shiftry!
A4_2370_DIRTENG_100_1000	Shift.
A4_2370_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s asking how the human who normally comes to\nvisit is doing.
A4_2370_TIM_100_1000	Just as I thought—it must know Jessica!
A4_2370_DIRTENG_100_2000	Shift.
A4_2370_PIKACHU_100_2000	She comes here a lot to collect herbs, so it always\nshares some with her.
A4_2370_TIM_100_2000	How about we ask it some questions?
A4_2370_SEL_0_1000	About the bamboo forest...
A4_2370_SEL_0_2000	About Jessica...
A4_2370_DIRTENG_300_1000	Shift.
A4_2370_PIKACHU_300_1000	It says the bamboo forest felt empty and lonely back\nwhen the berserk Pokémon appeared.
A4_2370_TIM_300_1000	It must be referring to the incident two years back.\nSeeing the bamboo forest now, it’s hard to imagine\nit as such a bleak place...
A4_2370_PIKACHU_300_2000	Yeah. The people and Pokémon seem plenty happy\nto be here now.
A4_2370_DIRTENG_300_2000	Shift?
A4_2370_PIKACHU_300_3000	Yeah, I’m thinkin’ that sounds pretty—wait, what?!
A4_2370_PIKACHU_300_3500	Shiftry! Did you just use your special powers to read\nmy mind?!
A4_2370_TIM_300_2000	What’s wrong, Pikachu? What did Shiftry say?
A4_2370_PIKACHU_300_4000	It asked if I was gonna lie down and take a nap here.\nShiftry must’ve been reading my mind!
A4_2370_TIM_300_3000	Doesn’t take a mind reader to guess that’s what you\nwere thinking.
A4_2370_PIKACHU_300_5000	Doesn’t this peaceful setting make you wanna doze\noff too? Let’s both take a nap after we wrap up here.
A4_2370_TIM_300_4000	Hey, we didn’t come here to relax!
A4_2370_DIRTENG_400_1000	Shift.
A4_2370_PIKACHU_400_1000	Apparently Jessica collects pizza ingredients\nwhenever she comes to the bamboo forest.
A4_2370_TIM_400_1000	I guess she really is a hard worker!
A4_2370_DIRTENG_400_2000	Shift.
A4_2370_PIKACHU_400_2000	Jessica treats the Pokémon of the bamboo forest with\nrespect because she believes everyone here—humans\nand Pokémon—should live in harmony.
A4_2370_PIKACHU_400_3000	So Shiftry shows its appreciation by giving her herbs.
A4_2370_TIM_400_2000	Living in harmony, huh?
A4_2380_TIM_100_1000	Something’s moving in this bush. Let me take a look.
A4_2400_TIM_100_1000	Hey, it’s a Chansey!
A4_2400_LUCKY_100_1000	Chanse!
A4_2400_TIM_100_2000	Don’t you think that egg it’s holding would make a\nperfect pizza ingredient?
A4_2400_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, I’m sure Jessica would be thrilled if we brought\nher one of Chansey’s eggs.
A4_2400_LUCKY_100_2000	Chanse chanse!
A4_2400_PIKACHU_100_2000	It says it’ll give us one! Aren’t you glad we chanced\nupon a Chansey?
A4_2400_TIM_100_3000	“Chanced upon a Chansey”? Pikachu...that’s one of\nthe worst dad jokes I’ve ever heard.
A4_2400_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hey—for once, the pun was NOT intended!
A4_2410_LUCKY_100_1000	Chan chanse!
A4_2410_PIKACHU_100_1000	It says that egg should be just what Jessica’s\nlooking for.
A4_2410_TIM_100_1000	So it knows Jessica?
A4_2410_LUCKY_100_2000	Chansey!
A4_2410_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yep. They see each other in the forest all the time.
A4_2410_TIM_100_2000	In that case, maybe we can ask it some questions.
A4_2410_SEL_0_1000	About the bamboo forest...
A4_2410_SEL_0_2000	About Jessica...
A4_2410_LUCKY_300_1000	Chansey chanse.
A4_2410_PIKACHU_300_1000	It says that Pokémon like to come to the bamboo\nforest because of its abundant nature.
A4_2410_PIKACHU_300_2000	The water and air here are so fresh and clean,\nit never wants to leave this place.
A4_2410_TIM_300_1000	Sounds like a comfortable home for these Pokémon.
A4_2410_PIKACHU_300_3000	Yep. Must be the same for Jessica too.
A4_2410_LUCKY_400_1000	Chansey!
A4_2410_PIKACHU_400_1000	Jessica’s a hard worker who likes to put others first?\nYeah, that tracks.
A4_2410_LUCKY_400_2000	Chanse chanse.
A4_2410_PIKACHU_400_2000	Couldn’t agree more, Chansey. Someone like Jessica\ndoes deserve to be happy.
A4_2410_TIM_400_1000	I think I understand that feeling.
A4_2410_PIKACHU_400_3000	Me too. If you work hard, you deserve all the great\nthings that come with it!
A4_2413_TIM_100_1000	Hey, Pikachu... This thing looks awfully familiar.\nWhat is it?
A4_2420_TIM_100_1000	Whoa! Oh, it’s a Foongus.
A4_2420_PIKACHU_100_1000	Heh heh... I think we’ve got a Foongus among us!\nGet it?
A4_2420_PIKACHU_100_2000	...What’s with that look, Tim?
A4_2420_PIKACHU_100_3000	Blurting out whatever pops into my head is how I\nkeep my mind sharp as a tack!
A4_2420_TIM_100_2000	Really? You think having no filter keeps your\nmind sharp?
A4_2420_PIKACHU_100_4000	Y’know, if you just loosened up a bit, you’d be that\nmuch closer to being a great detective like me.
A4_2420_TAMAGETAKE_100_1000	Foooon?
A4_2420_TIM_100_3000	Look, now you’ve gone and confused it.
A4_2420_PIKACHU_100_5000	Sorry, sorry. OK, Foongus, let’s chat!
A4_2420_TAMAGETAKE_100_2000	Foon foooon!
A4_2420_TAMAGETAKE_200_1000	Foooon.
A4_2420_PIKACHU_200_1000	I heard Foongus can release poisonous spores.
A4_2420_TIM_200_1000	What?!
A4_2420_PIKACHU_200_2000	Relax. We’re not a threat to it, so we should be fine.
A4_2420_TAMAGETAKE_200_2000	Foongaaa.
A4_2420_SEL_0_1000	About the bamboo forest...
A4_2420_SEL_0_2000	About Jessica...
A4_2420_PIKACHU_300_1000	We’re looking for mushrooms. Any idea where we\ncan find some?
A4_2420_TAMAGETAKE_300_1000	Foon!
A4_2420_PIKACHU_300_2000	Oh... Mushrooms are in short supply this time of year.
A4_2420_TAMAGETAKE_300_2000	Foon foooon.
A4_2420_PIKACHU_300_3000	But its friend Paras might know where to get some.
A4_2420_TIM_300_1000	Paras? OK, thanks! We’ll go ask it.
A4_2420_TAMAGETAKE_400_1000	Foonga!
A4_2420_PIKACHU_400_1000	It says it sees Jessica all the time, and she’s always\nbeen kind to the Pokémon around here.
A4_2420_TIM_400_1000	Sounds like Foongus thinks very highly of her.
A4_2425_TIM_100_1000	Are those mushrooms?! Ah... Never mind. It’s a Paras.
A4_2425_BAWOMAN01_100_1000	Oh? What about my dear Paras?
A4_2425_TIM_100_2000	Well, we’re helping the pizzeria manager look for\nmushrooms...
A4_2425_BAWOMAN01_100_2000	Indeed? You must be looking for ingredients for their\ndaily specials.
A4_2425_PIKACHU_100_1000	She’s oddly perceptive...
A4_2425_BAWOMAN01_100_3000	Good luck finding them. Hee hee hee...
A4_2450_PARAS_100_1000	Para para.
A4_2450_PIKACHU_100_2000	Come to think of it, Paras has mushrooms growing\non its back.
A4_2450_TIM_100_500	Uhhh... Are those things edible?
A4_2450_PARAS_100_2000	Para para. Paras!
A4_2450_PIKACHU_100_3000	If we’re looking for mushrooms, Paras says we’re\nwelcome to take some.
A4_2450_TIM_100_1000	Is that even safe?!
A4_2450_PARAS_100_3000	Para paraaa! ♪
A4_2450_PIKACHU_100_4000	Now those are some jumbo-sized mushrooms!
A4_2450_PIKACHU_100_5000	Guess he had some tucked away for a rainy day.
A4_2450_TIM_100_2000	For a moment, I was worried he was gonna give us\nthe mushrooms off his back!
A4_2450_PIKACHU_100_6000	Thanks, Paras! The pizzeria manager can’t make his\npizza without those mushrooms!
A4_2450_BAWOMAN01_100_500	Hee hee hee. Looks like my dear Paras gave you\nsome mushrooms.
A4_2450_BAWOMAN01_100_1000	They go quite nicely on pizza. You should try it!
A4_2450_TIM_100_3000	Th-thanks for the tip...
A4_2450_BAWOMAN01_100_2000	...Now I want some too. Let’s go get a slice, Paras!
A4_2450_PARAS_100_4000	Paraaas.
A4_2450_PIKACHU_100_7000	Must be one heck of a pie. Glad we could find the\nmushrooms for it!
A4_2455_BAWOMAN01_100_1000	Isn’t my dear Paras ever so nice?
A4_2455_TIM_100_1000	It sure is. It even shared some mushrooms with us.

A4_2465_TIM_100_1000	Hey there, do you need help finding something?
A4_2465_BHMAN01_100_1000	I’m OK. It takes a special technique to get the stuff\nI’m looking for anyway.
A4_2465_TIM_100_2000	Oh, really. What is it you’re trying to find?
A4_2465_BHMAN01_100_2000	Oval Stones, Energy Roots, bug Pokémon husks...\nStuff like that.
A4_2465_PIKACHU_100_1000	What a strange list of things for a kid...
A4_2470_PIKACHU_300_1000	Hey, Tim. Aren’t we supposed to head to the charcoal\nkiln with Jessica and Rachel?
A4_2470_PIKACHU_400_1000	We’ve got all our ingredients. Let’s get back to\nJessica.
A4_2470_PIKACHU_500_1000	Let’s not get distracted. We should hurry up, gather\nour ingredients, and head back to Jessica.
A4_2475_PIKACHU_300_1000	Hey, Tim. Aren’t we supposed to head to the charcoal\nkiln with Jessica and Rachel?

A4_2485_RACHEL_100_1000	You got all the ingredients? Great work!
A4_2490_TIM_100_1000	We’ve found all the ingredients, Jessica.
A4_2490_JESSICA_100_1000	Oh, you even found the mushrooms! Thanks, you two.
A4_2490_RACHEL_100_1000	Not bad! We got our Energy Root too.
A4_2490_TIM_100_2000	Wow, that’s one big root.
A4_2490_JESSICA_100_2000	Thank you, everyone.
A4_2490_JESSICA_100_3000	Sorry for all the trouble. I’m sure you came here to\nhave fun.
A4_2490_TIM_100_3000	It’s not a problem. And we did have fun!
A4_2490_PIKACHU_100_1000	The Pokémon here are interesting to talk to. They’re\ndifferent from the ones in other parts of Ryme City.
A4_2490_JESSICA_100_4000	Glad to hear that! Why don’t we rest a bit and then\nhead to the charcoal kiln?
A4_2490_TIM_100_5000	Before we do that, Jessica, there’s something I’d like\nyou to look at.
A4_2490_JESSICA_100_5000	Oh. Me?
A4_2490_JESSICA_100_6000	What do you want to show me?
A4_2510_TIM_100_1000	What project was that?
A4_2510_JESSICA_100_1000	That was about two years ago. Ryme City had formed\na partnership with the lab I was working at...
A4_2510_JESSICA_100_2000	Oh! By “lab,” I mean the Pokémon Unity Lab.
A4_2510_JESSICA_100_3000	Anyway, that’s where we launched our project to\ncreate a better way for humans and Pokémon to\ncoexist.
A4_2510_JESSICA_100_4000	The people in this photo were the project’s key\nmembers at that time.
A4_2510_RACHEL_100_1000	You don’t say...
A4_2510_RACHEL_100_2000	I remember now! Mama mentioned that when the\nthree of us were having dinner as a family.
A4_2510_RACHEL_100_3000	She was so happy when she announced that she and\nPapa were going to be working on a project together.
A4_2510_RACHEL_100_4000	I knew it was an exciting thing for them at the time,\nbut I had no idea it was that big of a deal.
A4_2510_RACHEL_100_4500	Mama and I used to chat about Pokémon, but she\nnever discussed the details of her job.
A4_2510_RACHEL_100_5000	I didn’t know you were a part of it too, Jessica—and\nas one of the main contributors!
A4_2510_JESSICA_100_5000	Tim, why do you have this photo?
A4_2510_PIKACHU_100_1000	Better not tell her you found it at the police station!\nWe don’t wanna make her worry.
A4_2510_TIM_100_3000	Umm, well...
A4_2510_RACHEL_100_6000	It’s part of an assignment for one of our college\ncourses. We were asked to write a report about\nthe mayor.
A4_2510_RACHEL_100_7000	And we found this photo while looking at Papa’s\ndesk. Right, Tim?
A4_2510_TIM_100_4000	R-right.
A4_2510_JESSICA_100_6000	Hehe. Sounds like a challenging assignment!\n
A4_2510_PIKACHU_100_2000	Phew. Saved by Rachel’s quick thinking.
A4_2510_TIM_100_5000	Um, can I ask you about the others in the photo?
A4_2510_JESSICA_100_7000	Sure, I don’t mind.
A4_2510_PIKACHU_100_3000	Sorry if these questions end up killing the\npeaceful vibe...
A4_2510_SEL_0_1000	About you, Jessica...
A4_2510_SEL_0_2000	About Mayor Myers...
A4_2510_SEL_0_3000	About Merloch...
A4_2510_SEL_0_4000	About Emma...
A4_2510_TIM_300_1000	So, you were working at the Pokémon Unity Lab.\nDoes that mean you were a researcher?
A4_2510_JESSICA_300_1000	Yes, I was researching Pokémon behavior.
A4_2510_RACHEL_300_1000	Did you meet Mama through the project?
A4_2510_JESSICA_300_2000	No, your mother and I were in different departments\ninitially. I first learned who Emma was from a paper\nshe published.
A4_2510_TIM_300_2000	So you were introduced to Rachel’s mom through her\nresearch?
A4_2510_JESSICA_300_3000	That’s right. Emma envisioned a future where humans\nand Pokémon could communicate!
A4_2510_JESSICA_300_4000	Her paper really was revolutionary. Our colleagues\nhad nothing but praise for it.
A4_2510_JESSICA_300_5000	I was awestruck by it, too, of course.
A4_2510_JESSICA_300_6000	I went straight to her after reading it. We talked\nabout her paper, her research, all kinds of things...
A4_2510_JESSICA_300_7000	That’s when I decided I’d do whatever I could to help\nEmma.
A4_2510_RACHEL_300_2000	I didn’t know her work was what brought you\ntogether.
A4_2510_JESSICA_300_8000	Yes. The entire project’s launch was based on\nher paper.
A4_2510_TIM_300_3000	Sounds like Emma’s paper about building a new\nfuture for Ryme City really changed your life.
A4_2510_PIKACHU_300_1000	I don’t even need to read Emma’s paper to know that.\nJust look at how Jessica’s beaming right now.
A4_2510_TIM_400_1000	I assume Mayor Myers is in this photo because of the\nlab’s partnership with Ryme City.
A4_2510_JESSICA_400_1000	Yes, that’s right. We were able to focus on our\nresearch thanks to his support.
A4_2510_JESSICA_400_2000	He and Emma never let their outside relationship\naffect their work.
A4_2510_JESSICA_400_3000	But I remember they’d talk about Pokémon for hours.
A4_2510_JESSICA_400_4000	They always supported and understood each other.
A4_2510_TIM_400_2000	It sounds like Mayor Myers has been thinking about\nhuman-Pokémon coexistence for a long time.
A4_2510_JESSICA_400_5000	Absolutely. The project never could have launched\nwithout his contributions.
A4_2510_TIM_500_1000	And Mr. Merloch was part of this project too?
A4_2510_JESSICA_500_1000	You know him?
A4_2510_RACHEL_500_1000	We ran into him in the city yesterday. He gave me\nthe creeps.
A4_2510_RACHEL_500_2000	Even Tim was surprised by how overbearing he was.
A4_2510_TIM_500_2000	He plucked some Pikachu’s fur and ran some test\non it.
A4_2510_JESSICA_500_2000	That sounds like something he’d do.
A4_2510_JESSICA_500_3000	He’s a brilliant scientist, sure...
A4_2510_JESSICA_500_3500	But he also thinks he’s the smartest person in any\nroom he’s in—and the only thing he values is his\nresearch.
A4_2510_JESSICA_500_4000	I didn’t really like him, to be honest.
A4_2510_RACHEL_500_3000	Wow, Jessica. I’ve never heard you say that\nabout anyone.
A4_2510_JESSICA_500_5000	The way he talked about Pokémon, he had such\nobvious contempt for them—he didn’t even try to\nhide it.
A4_2510_JESSICA_500_6000	He also used the lab for his pet projects, even though\nit was a public research facility.
A4_2510_JESSICA_500_7000	No one knew exactly what he was researching.
A4_2510_JESSICA_500_8000	But the quality of his work was always so impeccable\nthat people looked the other way.
A4_2510_TIM_600_1000	I assume the woman next to you in this photo is\nRachel’s mother, Emma?
A4_2510_RACHEL_600_1000	Jessica, what was Mama like at the lab? I’d love\nto know!
A4_2510_JESSICA_600_1000	Emma had two great loves: her family and Pokémon.
A4_2510_JESSICA_600_2000	Everyone liked and admired her. A lot of us worked\nextra hard just because we wanted to impress her.
A4_2510_JESSICA_600_3000	I really looked up to her myself. And then...
A4_2510_RACHEL_600_2000	You don’t have to talk about anything that makes\nyou feel uncomfortable—and don’t worry about me,\neither.
A4_2510_JESSICA_600_4000	OK...
A4_2510_JESSICA_600_5000	The project was going well, and morale was high\noverall. But then the R incident happened, and...
A4_2510_JESSICA_600_6000	Emma, she...she was one of the casualties.
A4_2510_RACHEL_600_3000	... ... ...
A4_2510_TIM_600_2000	Rachel...
A4_2510_PIKACHU_600_1000	So that’s what happened. I should’ve known...\nI guess Tim already knew.
A4_2510_JESSICA_600_7000	After the accident, the project was canceled. I heard\nthe lab’s been shut down too.
A4_2510_RACHEL_600_4000	And that’s why you’re in Bamboo Borough now...
A4_2510_JESSICA_600_8000	That’s right. I was nervous when I first came here, but\neveryone has been very kind to me.
A4_2510_JESSICA_600_9000	I’m enjoying myself here now.
A4_2520_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thanks to Jessica, we were able to gather information\nabout everyone in the photo.
A4_2520_PIKACHU_100_1333	We even learned about the lab and the research they\nwere doing.
A4_2520_PIKACHU_100_1666	We still don’t know why Unitas was targeting Jessica...
A4_2520_PIKACHU_100_2000	But we haven’t seen anyone suspicious so far.
A4_2520_PIKACHU_100_3000	Now that Butler’s behind bars, I think it’s safe to say\nthat Jessica’s no longer a target.
A4_2520_TIM_100_3000	Thank you, Jessica. We’ve learned a lot today.
A4_2520_RACHEL_100_1000	I’m so glad I got to hear about everything too.
A4_2520_JESSICA_100_1000	I’m not sure if anything I said was helpful...
A4_2520_TIM_100_4000	Trust me, it’s a huge help! I’m sure our report will turn\nout great thanks to you.
A4_2520_JESSICA_100_2000	And by “report,” you mean “detective work.”\nRight, Tim?
A4_2520_TIM_100_5000	What?! Oh, um, uhhh...
A4_2520_PIKACHU_100_4000	*sigh* Couldn’t quite stick the landing, huh...\nYou’ll get the hang of this eventually, Tim.
A4_2520_JESSICA_100_3000	You’re good at telling when people are lying, but not\nso much at telling lies yourself. Am I right? Heheheh.
A4_2520_TIM_100_6000	I’m sorry, Jessica.
A4_2520_RACHEL_100_2000	Yeah, me too.
A4_2520_JESSICA_100_4000	It’s all right. I could tell something was off from the\nquestions you were asking—but the weirdness of this\nphoto confirmed it.
A4_2520_TIM_100_7000	Huh?
A4_2520_JESSICA_100_5000	Did you think I wouldn’t notice the red circle drawn\naround my face?
A4_2520_PIKACHU_100_5000	Yikes. We forgot about that!
A4_2520_JESSICA_100_6000	I don’t get why, but it seems like you’re worried\nabout me.
A4_2520_JESSICA_100_7000	I’m doing OK. Nothing unusual has been going\non, either.
A4_2520_PIKACHU_100_6000	Making Jessica worry is exactly what I wanted to\navoid... Guess I shouldn’t rest on my laurels, either.
A4_2520_TIM_100_8000	So, uh, Jessica... Should we head over to the charcoal\nkiln soon?
A4_2520_JESSICA_100_8000	Yes, we should. Is there anything else you need to do?
A4_2520_JESSICA_100_9000	If so, I can wait until you finish up. Just let me know\nwhen you’re ready.
A4_2520_TIM_100_9000	OK.
A4_2523_RACHEL_100_1000	We’ll be waiting here.
A4_2525_JESSICA_100_1000	Were you able to finish up everything, Tim?
A4_2525_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_2525_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_2525_JESSICA_300_1000	Well then, let’s head over to the charcoal kiln. You’ll\nsee it right after crossing the bridge up ahead.
A4_2525_JESSICA_400_1000	OK.
A4_25400_PIKACHU_200_1000	Oh hey, some Nanab Berries are growing here.
A4_25400_GORONDA_200_1000	(Yeah. But I noticed they’re only growing in this spot.)
A4_25400_PIKACHU_200_2000	A Nanab Berry tree growing in a forest full of\nbamboo... How interesting.
A4_25400_PIKACHU_300_1000	Oh hey, some Nanab Berries are growing here.
A4_25400_GORONDA_300_1000	(Yeah. But I noticed they’re only growing in this spot.)
A4_25400_PIKACHU_300_2000	A Nanab Berry tree growing in a forest full of\nbamboo... How interesting.
A4_25400_GORONDA_300_2000	(These Berries are real sweet.)
A4_25400_PIKACHU_300_3000	A sweet Berry, eh? Maybe Skwovet would enjoy ’em.
A4_25400_PIKACHU_300_4000	Let’s bring one over to it later.
A4_25400_PIKACHU_400_1000	Oh hey, some Nanab Berries are growing here.
A4_25400_GORONDA_400_1000	(Yeah. But I noticed they’re only growing in this spot.)
A4_25400_PIKACHU_400_2000	A Nanab Berry tree growing in a forest full of\nbamboo... How interesting.
A4_2550_PIKACHU_100_1000	How’d it take me so long to realize?
A4_2550_PIKACHU_100_2000	This place hasn’t changed one bit since then.
A4_2550_TIM_100_1000	Did you remember something again?
A4_2550_PIKACHU_100_3000	This is where I was protecting the injured Pancham.
A4_2550_PIKACHU_100_4000	When I tried to get a closer look at Pancham, I met\nPikachu—I mean, I met Harry.
A4_2550_TIM_100_2000	What?
A4_2550_TIM_100_3000	So this is where you and Dad met...
A4_2550_TIM_100_4000	Can you tell me more about that?
A4_2550_PIKACHU_100_5000	Yeah, sure thing.
A4_2550_SEL_0_1000	About when you met Dad...
A4_2550_SEL_0_2000	About Pancham’s injury...
A4_2550_TIM_300_1000	You mentioned before that you met Dad in the\nbamboo forest.
A4_2550_TIM_300_2000	Is this exactly where it happened?
A4_2550_PIKACHU_300_1000	Yep. <color=#F39800FF>This is where I was protecting Pancham while he\nwas injured. Didn’t leave his side once till he was all\nbetter.</color>
A4_2550_PIKACHU_300_2000	When I saw Harry come closer, I jumped out ’cause he\nlooked suspicious!
A4_2550_PIKACHU_300_3000	Pikachu jumping out like that really startled me. I was\njust trying to get a closer look at Pancham’s injury.
A4_2550_PIKACHU_300_4000	I guess I must’ve looked suspicious, because <color=#F39800FF>the\nmoment Pikachu saw me, he tried to scare me off</color>.
A4_2550_TIM_300_3000	Wait, hold on!
A4_2550_TIM_300_4000	Your story doesn’t make sense...
A4_2550_PIKACHU_300_5000	Huh? What part don’t you get?
A4_2550_TIM_300_5000	You were protecting Pancham, and then you startled\nyourself when you jumped out?
A4_2550_TIM_300_6000	What in the world...
A4_2550_TIM_400_1000	So, you were protecting the injured Pancham.
A4_2550_PIKACHU_400_1000	Yeah. Pancham got hurt by a berserk Pokémon.
A4_2550_PIKACHU_400_2000	I tried to help by battling the berserk Pokémon, but\nit was too big. Took a lot of effort just to make it\ngo away.
A4_2550_TIM_400_2000	It sounds like you helped out plenty!
A4_2550_PIKACHU_400_3000	Anyway, <color=#F39800FF>I checked on Pancham’s injury</color> while Pikachu\nwas trying to scare me off.
A4_2550_PIKACHU_400_4000	I left Pikachu to watch over Pancham, then I ran all\nover the neighborhood and the bamboo forest to\n<color=#F39800FF>collect some medicine</color>.
A4_2550_PIKACHU_400_5000	And then, <color=#F39800FF>I managed to heal Pancham</color>. Who knows\nwhat would’ve happened if I’d taken any longer...
A4_2550_TIM_400_3000	So you were protecting Pancham...
A4_2550_TIM_400_4000	Then you got some medicine for Pancham...
A4_2550_TIM_400_5000	Was it you or Dad who got the medicine?
A4_2550_PIKACHU_400_6000	It was me, of course.
A4_2550_TIM_400_6000	Hmmm...
A4_25500_DORONCH_200_1000	(I’m glad Dreepy loves to explore, but it’s starting to\nget out of hand.)
A4_25500_PIKACHU_200_1000	Well, at least it found its way back to you safe and\nsound. I’d let this one slide.
A4_25500_DORONCH_300_1000	(I’m so glad Dreepy made his way back safely!)
A4_25500_GORONDA_300_1000	(Me too.)
A4_25500_PIKACHU_300_1000	Looks like everything’s good now.
A4_25500_PIKACHU_300_2000	Hmph... Don’t ever worry Drakloak like that again!
A4_25500_DORAMESHIYA_300_1000	(Sorry I made you all worryyy.)
A4_25500_DORONCH_300_2000	(Thanks for your help. Let me return the favor by\ngiving you a ride.)
A4_25500_PIKACHU_300_3000	Thanks, but I’ll pass—I’m a little old for Drakloak\nrides.
A4_25500_DORONCHS_400_1000	(Since my little one is gone, why don’t I put that\nPikachu on my head?)
A4_25500_PIKACHU_400_1000	Wait, wait! Don’t put me on your head without asking!
A4_25500_PIKACHU_400_2000	I’ll find your Dreepy. Just hang tight, Drakloak!
A4_25500_DORONCHS_500_1000	(Aw, geez... Where did you go?)
A4_25500_PIKACHU_500_1000	That Drakloak looks bothered about something.
A4_25500_GORONDA_500_1000	(Weird—I don’t see the Dreepy that’s usually on\nits head.)
A4_25500_DORONCHS_500_2000	(Oh, Pangoro? Looks like it’s your turn today to have\na Pokémon ride on you.)
A4_25500_GORONDA_500_2000	(Yeah. It’s a long story.)
A4_25500_DORONCHS_500_3000	(Anyway, I need you to hear this... You know how I\ntake care of a Dreepy on my head?)
A4_25500_DORONCHS_500_4000	(My little one went off to play and hasn’t come\nback yet.)
A4_25500_GORONDA_500_3000	(So he’s lost, huh.)
A4_25500_PIKACHU_500_2000	Any idea where he could be?
A4_25500_DORONCHS_500_5000	(Not exactly, but I think he’s still somewhere in the\nbamboo forest.)
A4_25500_GORONDA_500_4000	(That narrows it down some. The bamboo forest is\nstill pretty big, though...)
A4_25500_PIKACHU_500_5000	If we find Dreepy, we’ll bring him back to you. Just\nhang in there, Drakloak!
A4_2551_TIM_100_1000	Another story from Pikachu that doesn’t make sense...
A4_2551_TIM_100_2000	He didn’t even notice that some of the things he said\ndon’t add up. That’s not like him... I’m kinda worried.
A4_25510_DORAMESHIYA_400_2000	(Pangoro, Pikachu—what’s up?)
A4_25510_PIKACHU_400_2000	Drakloak’s been looking all over for you, that’s\n“what’s up”!
A4_25510_GORONDA_400_2000	(It’s worried itself sick thinking that you’re lost.)
A4_25510_DORAMESHIYA_400_3000	(I’m not lost. I’m just exploring.)
A4_25510_PIKACHU_400_3000	Whatever you’re doing, could you at least check back\nin with Drakloak so it can stop worrying about you?
A4_25510_DORAMESHIYA_400_4000	(That’s what I’m exploring to find—my way home!)
A4_25510_PIKACHU_400_4000	So you ARE lost...
A4_25510_PIKACHU_400_5000	Drakloak is waiting for you back by the clearing\nnear the entrance to the forest.
A4_25510_DORAMESHIYA_400_5000	(Over theeerrre?)
A4_25510_DORAMESHIYA_500_1000	(... ... ...)
A4_25510_GORONDA_500_1000	(Hm? It’s Dreepy.)
A4_25510_GORONDA_500_2000	(Aren’t you usually riding on Drakloak’s head?)
A4_25510_DORAMESHIYA_500_2000	(Yeah, but right now I’m exploring the forest all on\nmy own.)
A4_25510_GORONDA_500_3000	(All right. Be safe out there.)
A4_25520_GORONDA_100_1000	(I’m worried that kid’s gonna get lost all over again.)
A4_25520_PIKACHU_100_1000	You and me both. Let’s follow him back.
A4_2555_TIM_100_1000	Pikachu, you should probably rest back in town.
A4_2555_PIKACHU_100_1000	Stop treating me like I’m about to keel over, Tim.\nThere’s nothing to worry about.
A4_2556_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s nothing wrong with me. I’m fine.
A4_2560_TIM_100_1000	I can’t just ignore this. I need to figure out what’s\ngoing on with Pikachu.
A4_25600_WANPACHI_200_1000	(Mmm... Soft, warm, melty cheese... I want it so bad,\nI can almost smell it!)
A4_25600_PIKACHU_200_1000	Thanks for waiting, Yamper! Here’s that cheese you\nwanted so bad.
A4_25600_WANPACHI_200_2000	(Yay! CHEESE!)
A4_25600_PIKACHU_200_2000	Easy there! There’s plenty of cheese—no need to\ngobble it up so fast...
A4_25600_WANPACHI_200_3000	(Ahhh, that’s the stuff! Exactly what I was craving!)
A4_25600_PIKACHU_200_3000	Whoa!
A4_25600_GORONDA_200_1000	(Hey, slow down!)
A4_25600_GORONDA_200_2000	(Scarfed it all down in one go...)
A4_25600_WANPACHI_200_4000	(That was the tastiest cheese I’ve had in my LIFE!)
A4_25600_PIKACHU_200_4000	Glad to hear it. And I’m sure the pizzeria’s manager\nwould be thankful for the positive review.
A4_25600_WANPACHI_200_5000	(More! Gimme more cheese!)
A4_25600_PIKACHU_200_5000	You want MORE?! Don’t be so greedy!
A4_25600_WANPACHI_200_6000	(I can’t wait another second! I can get more in town,\nright? OK then, off I gooo!)
A4_25600_GORONDA_200_3000	(It ran straight toward the town...)
A4_25600_PIKACHU_200_6000	I guess that’s settled for now?
A4_25600_WANPACHI_300_1000	(Cheese... Soft, melty cheese...)
A4_25600_PIKACHU_300_1000	Hang in there. We’ll go find some cheese for you\nin town.
A4_25600_WANPACHI_400_1000	(I’m so hungry...)
A4_25600_PIKACHU_400_1000	This Yamper sounds a little low energy...
A4_25600_GORONDA_400_1000	(Might be in trouble.)
A4_25600_PIKACHU_400_2000	Hey, Yamper. Something wrong?
A4_25600_WANPACHI_400_2000	(I’m so hungry I can barely move...)
A4_25600_GORONDA_400_2000	(There’s plenty to eat around here.)
A4_25600_WANPACHI_400_3000	(But nothing in this forest is suited to my palate...)
A4_25600_WANPACHI_400_4000	(I’m from the city, so I want something from there...)
A4_25600_PIKACHU_400_3000	You’re real spoiled, huh.
A4_25600_GORONDA_400_3000	(You WANNA eat human food? Can’t relate.)
A4_25600_PIKACHU_400_4000	I guess we could go back to town and find something\nyou’d like...
A4_25600_WANPACHI_400_5000	(Really? In that case, I want some soft, melty cheese.)
A4_25600_PIKACHU_400_5000	*sigh* You’re awful picky.
A4_2565_PIKACHU_100_1000	Say...do you feel the ground shaking?
A4_2565_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, I do... Wait, huh?
A4_2565_TIM_100_2000	It feels like it’s getting stronger!
A4_2565_PIKACHU_100_2000	Something’s coming! This is bad!
A4_2580_PIKACHU_100_1000	Who would’ve thought we’d run into each other\nlike this?
A4_2580_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro.
A4_2580_TIM_100_1000	Do you two know each other?
A4_2580_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, he helped me out back at the police station.\nWe escaped the detainment room together too!
A4_2580_TIM_100_2000	Oh, I had no idea. In a way, that means you helped\nme out too!
A4_2580_TIM_100_3000	Thanks for all you did yesterday, Pangoro.
A4_2580_GORONDA_100_2000	Gorooo.
A4_2580_PIKACHU_100_3000	So, what brings you all the way out here?
A4_2580_GORONDA_100_3000	Goro.
A4_2580_PIKACHU_100_4000	Oh, right. This is where you’re from. Well, I hope\nyou’ve been able to rest up, Pangoro!
A4_2580_GORONDA_100_4000	Goro!
A4_25800_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh? Did I just see something sparkle?
A4_25800_GORONDA_100_1000	(What’s this?)
A4_25800_PIKACHU_100_2000	It’s a brooch—must be the one Meowth was\nlooking for.
A4_25800_PIKACHU_100_3000	How’d he end up losing it all the way out here?\nGuess I oughta return it to him.
A4_2602_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro?
A4_2602_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, that scream came from one of our friends.\nSorry, but we’ll have to catch up later.
A4_2608_TAMAGETAKE_200_1000	Fooon.
A4_2608_PIKACHU_200_1000	Yeah, that startled me too.
A4_2610_DIRTENG_100_1000	Shift.
A4_2610_PIKACHU_100_1000	Some rocks suddenly started falling from above?!
A4_26100_MIMIKKYU_200_1000	(Done—my disguise is all fixed up!)
A4_26100_GORONDA_200_1000	(Glad to hear it.)
A4_26100_GORONDA_200_2000	(But you should probably steer clear of the storage\narea for a while.)
A4_26100_MIMIKKYUB_300_1000	(How am I supposed to make any friends with a\nbroken disguise?)
A4_26100_MIMIKKYUB_300_2000	(I need to fix it right away... If only I had a mirror...)
A4_26100_PIKACHU_300_1000	Oh yeah, that reminds me! We borrowed a mirror from\nthe souvenir shop!
A4_26100_PIKACHU_300_2000	Will this work?
A4_26100_MIMIKKYUB_300_3000	(Wow, it’s the perfect size! I can definitely fix my\ndisguise with this!)
A4_26100_PIKACHU_300_3000	Guess we brought the right mirror.
A4_26100_MIMIKKYUB_300_4000	(Ummm... I’d rather not be seen fixing my disguise...\nIt’s kind of embarrassing...)
A4_26100_GORONDA_300_1000	(Oh, sorry. Should we turn around?)
A4_26100_MIMIKKYUB_300_5000	(Yeah! I’ll let you know when I’m done!)
A4_26100_MIMIKKYUB_400_1000	(How am I supposed to make any friends with a\nbroken disguise?)
A4_26100_MIMIKKYUB_400_2000	(I need to fix it right away... If only I had a mirror...)
A4_26100_MIMIKKYUB_500_1000	(Waaahhh... My disguise...)
A4_26100_GORONDA_500_1000	(What happened?)
A4_26100_MIMIKKYUB_500_2000	(I was taking a walk around the storage area when an\nunfamiliar Pokémon attacked me...)
A4_26100_GORONDA_500_2000	(Sounds scary.)
A4_26100_MIMIKKYUB_500_3000	(I ran away as fast as I could, but...look at this...)
A4_26100_MIMIKKYUB_500_4000	(My disguise!)
A4_26100_GORONDA_500_3000	(Completely busted, huh.)
A4_26100_MIMIKKYUB_500_5000	(Hey, can you help me fix it?)
A4_26100_GORONDA_500_4000	(Sorry, but I’m no good with little fiddly stuff.)
A4_26100_MIMIKKYUB_500_6000	(Okaaay... If only I had a mirror, I could fix it myself...)
A4_26100_PIKACHU_500_1000	A mirror, huh? Maybe Tim and I can go look for one\nnext time we’re back in town.
A4_26110_MIMIKKYU_100_1000	(Ta-da!)
A4_26110_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, you did it!
A4_26110_GORONDA_100_1000	(Glad you could fix it, Mimikyu.)
A4_26110_MIMIKKYU_100_2000	(Thanks, you two!)
A4_2612_LUCKY_100_1000	Chan chanse?
A4_2612_PIKACHU_100_1000	I dunno. We’re gonna go see what happened.
A4_2614_TIM_100_1000	Hey, are you OK?
A4_2614_BHMAN01_100_1000	I’m fine, but that was terrifying! The ground started\nshaking outta nowhere—and then I heard a scream!
A4_2614_TIM_100_2000	Did you happen to see anyone?
A4_2614_BHMAN01_100_2000	No, I didn’t.
A4_2614_PIKACHU_100_1000	Seems like Rachel and Jessica haven’t come this way.
A4_2620_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s not where the scream came from. We need to\ngo the opposite direction.
A4_2620_TIM_100_1000	Right. Let’s go there now!
A4_26200_YORUNOZUKU_400_1000	(Why is that Pikachu riding on your shoulder,\nPangoro?)
A4_26200_GORONDA_400_1000	(Long story short, I’m helping him out.)
A4_26200_YORUNOZUKU_400_2000	(I see. Well, something feels off in the bamboo forest\ntoday. I advise you to stay cautious.)
A4_26200_GORONDA_400_2000	(Will do. Thanks.)
A4_26200_YORUNOZUKU_500_1000	(Oh. Hello there, Pangoro.)
A4_26200_PIKACHU_500_1000	This Pokémon is perched up there, watching over the\nbamboo forest.
A4_26200_GORONDA_500_1000	(That’s Noctowl. It keeps an eye out for anyone\nsuspicious in the bamboo forest.)
A4_26200_YORUNOZUKU_500_2000	(Pikachu, eh... Now there’s a Pokémon that brings\nback memories.)
A4_26200_PIKACHU_500_2000	Whaddya mean? There was another Pikachu here?
A4_26200_YORUNOZUKU_500_3000	(That’s nothing unusual—all kinds of Pokémon come\nto this forest.)
A4_26200_PIKACHU_500_3000	Why are you looking out for danger?
A4_26200_YORUNOZUKU_500_4000	(An unfamiliar Pokémon went on a rampage here a\nwhile back.)
A4_26200_YORUNOZUKU_500_5000	(Since then, whenever I’ve spotted potential danger,\nI’ve tried to alert everyone I know.)
A4_26200_PIKACHU_500_4000	You must be referring to the berserk Pokémon.
A4_26200_YORUNOZUKU_500_6000	(Yes, well, this is also something of a hobby for me.)
A4_26200_PIKACHU_500_5000	What an odd way to pass the time... Hm? Wait a sec.
A4_26200_PIKACHU_500_6000	Everything you said matches what the quiz professor\ntold us earlier.
A4_26200_PIKACHU_500_7000	Aha! Now I know the answer to her question. I’ll have\nto tell Tim later.
A4_26200_YORUNOZUKU_600_1000	(Why is that Pikachu riding on your shoulder,\nPangoro?)
A4_26200_GORONDA_600_1000	(Long story short, I’m helping him out.)
A4_26200_YORUNOZUKU_600_2000	(I see. Well, something feels off in the bamboo forest\ntoday. I advise you to stay cautious.)
A4_26200_GORONDA_600_2000	(Will do. Thanks.)
A4_26210_JUPTILE_400_1000	(Hey, Pangoro! You headed to the charcoal kiln?)
A4_26210_GORONDA_400_1000	(Yeah. Pikachu wants me to take him there.)
A4_26210_JUPTILE_400_2000	(Something might have happened there. Be careful.)
A4_26210_GORONDA_400_2000	(Will do.)
A4_26210_JUPTILE_500_1000	(Hey, Pangoro! What’s with you carrying Pikachu on\nyour shoulder?)
A4_26210_PIKACHU_500_1000	Oh. You two know each other?
A4_26210_GORONDA_500_1000	(Yeah, this is Grovyle. It’s got a strong sense of justice\nand protects all the Pokémon living in the forest.)
A4_26210_JUPTILE_500_2000	(I came out here ’cause I heard a strange noise, and\nsure enough—you two are about as strange as it gets!)
A4_26210_GORONDA_500_2000	(Pikachu asked for my help.)
A4_26210_JUPTILE_500_3000	(Uh-huh. Well, whatever’s going down, it shouldn’t be\nTOO much of a problem for you.)
A4_26210_GORONDA_500_3000	(Whaddya mean?)
A4_26210_JUPTILE_500_4000	(I’ve got a bad feeling—the same kind of feeling I\nhad back when the Pokémon went berserk.)
A4_26210_GORONDA_500_4000	(That’s not good.)
A4_26210_JUPTILE_500_5000	(But don’t worry. If anything happens, I’ll use my\nmoves to deal with it in a flash!)
A4_26210_GORONDA_500_5000	(With speed like yours, you could probably handle\nanything.)
A4_26210_PIKACHU_500_2000	Hm? An agile Pokémon with leaves growing on\nits body...
A4_26210_PIKACHU_500_3000	This must be the Pokémon the quiz professor was\ntalking about!
A4_26210_PIKACHU_500_4000	Thanks, Grovyle. You helped me suss out the answer.
A4_26210_JUPTILE_500_6000	(Oh? Not sure what you’re talking about, but I’m glad\nI could help.)
A4_26210_JUPTILE_600_1000	(Hey, Pangoro! You headed to the charcoal kiln?)
A4_26210_GORONDA_600_1000	(Yeah. Pikachu wants me to take him there.)
A4_26210_JUPTILE_600_2000	(Something might have happened there. Be careful.)
A4_26210_GORONDA_600_2000	(Who do you think you’re talking to? You got nothing\nto worry about.)
A4_2630_TIM_100_1000	What’s with all these rocks?! They weren’t here earlier.
A4_2630_PIKACHU_100_1000	They have to be connected to whatever happened to\nRachel and Jessica. Let’s check ’em out, Tim!
A4_26300_KOMATANA_200_1000	(What manner of Pokémon could possibly have made\na cut like this?)
A4_26300_PIKACHU_200_1000	We better find the Pokémon that cut this bamboo.
A4_26300_KOMATANA_300_1000	(Hmm... Just who could have done this?)
A4_26300_PIKACHU_300_1000	Hey, it’s the Pawniard Tim and I met while working on\nthe jewel case.
A4_26300_PIKACHU_300_2000	What’re you doing out here of all places?
A4_26300_KOMATANA_300_2000	(Is this Pikachu I see before me? What an odd turn of\nfate to meet again so soon.)
A4_26300_KOMATANA_300_3000	(I have come to the bamboo forest to further my\njourney to warriorhood.)
A4_26300_PIKACHU_300_3000	You’re here as a part of your journey? Huh.
A4_26300_GORONDA_300_1000	(You know each other?)
A4_26300_PIKACHU_300_4000	Yep. Well, we’ve met at least.
A4_26300_KOMATANA_300_4000	(Now that our greetings are concluded—behold!\nThis bamboo stalk!)
A4_26300_KOMATANA_300_5000	(Is it not marvelous?!)
A4_26300_PIKACHU_300_5000	Huh? Just looks like a cut-up stalk of bamboo to me...
A4_26300_KOMATANA_300_6000	(Fool! The sharpness of the cross-section, the beauty\nof the cut... None but a master of the blade could\nhave accomplished such a feat!)
A4_26300_KOMATANA_300_7000	(And only a warrior would be able to appreciate it!)
A4_26300_GORONDA_300_2000	(Is it really that special...?)
A4_26300_KOMATANA_300_8000	(A cut as clean as this could only be the work of a\nPokémon—one that utilized its move with excellence!)
A4_26300_KOMATANA_300_9000	(I beg of you, Pikachu!)
A4_26300_KOMATANA_300_10000	(Will you seek out the slicer of bamboo in my stead?!)
A4_26300_GORONDA_300_3000	(This guy seems desperate.)
A4_26300_PIKACHU_300_6000	Well, this warrior stuff IS really important to him...
A4_26300_PIKACHU_300_7000	OK, Pawniard. I can’t say no after a plea like that,\nnow can I?
A4_26300_KOMATANA_300_11000	(Oh! You will accept my request?!)
A4_26300_PIKACHU_300_8000	You bet! Hang tight, Pawniard. We’ll track down that\nPokémon for you!
A4_26300_KOMATANA_300_12000	(Your efforts will not go unappreciated!)
A4_26310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_400_1000	(Oh? May I help you?)
A4_26310_PIKACHU_400_1000	It’s Sirfetch’d...a Pokémon that uses its leaf as a shield\nand its leek as a sword...
A4_26310_PIKACHU_400_2000	Which can only mean one thing!
A4_26310_PIKACHU_400_3000	Hey, Sirfetch’d! You been cuttin’ up any bamboo\naround here recently?
A4_26310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_400_2000	(Indeed I have—a few stalks, as part of my training.)
A4_26310_PIKACHU_400_4000	I knew it!
A4_26310_PIKACHU_400_5000	Better go tell Pawniard right away!
A4_26310_KOMATANA_400_1000	(Hm! This Pokémon’s aura has a warrior’s edge...\nAt last I have found a true master of the art.)
A4_26310_KOMATANA_400_2000	(You cut through that stalk of bamboo, did you not?!)
A4_26310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_400_3000	(Indeed, ’twas I.)
A4_26310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_400_4000	(But what of it?)
A4_26310_KOMATANA_400_3000	(I come with a request—take me on as your\napprentice!)
A4_26310_KOMATANA_400_4000	(The clean cut—that beautiful cross section! It would\nbe an honor to learn those skills from you firsthand!)
A4_26310_GORONDA_400_2000	(So that’s why it was looking for Sirfetch’d.)
A4_26310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_400_5000	(Alas! I cannot take you under my wing, for I myself\nam not yet a full-fledged knight.)
A4_26310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_400_6000	(My techniques are unworthy of being taught as they\nare now.)
A4_26310_KOMATANA_400_5000	(Please reconsider—I beg of you!)
A4_26310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_400_7000	(Hmm... Though I cannot take you as an apprentice,\nwe are nevertheless two Pokémon cut from the same\ncloth, embarking on the same journey.)
A4_26310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_400_8000	(Let us travel the world, then, and hone our\ntechniques together. What say you?)
A4_26310_KOMATANA_400_6000	(Yes, sir!)
A4_26310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_400_9000	(It is settled. Henceforth, we walk this path as peers.)
A4_26310_KOMATANA_400_7000	(You have my eternal gratitude!)
A4_26310_PIKACHU_400_6000	Sounds like everything’s all sorted now.
A4_26310_KOMATANA_400_8000	(Thank you! I am in your debt.)
A4_26310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_400_10000	(Now then, let us depart.)
A4_26310_PIKACHU_400_7000	OK! Fare thee well and all that.
A4_26310_GORONDA_400_3000	(Couple of oddballs, those two. But I gotta say—\nthey’ve got passion.)
A4_26310_PIKACHU_400_8000	Yeah. Here’s hoping they reach their goal!
A4_26310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_500_1000	(Hm? A Pikachu riding a Pangoro? How delightfully\nfarfetched.)
A4_26310_GORONDA_500_1000	(What’s with the oversized veggies that Pokémon’s\nlugging around?)
A4_26310_PIKACHU_500_1000	That’s Sirfetch’d. The leaf is its shield, and it uses that\nleek as a weapon.
A4_26310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_500_2000	(Indeed. I am traveling the world to hone my\nswordsmanship.)
A4_26310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_500_3000	(My journey has taken me to this bamboo forest.)
A4_26310_PIKACHU_500_2000	So you’re on a journey to master the blade, huh?\nYou remind me of another Pokémon I’ve met...
A4_26310_NEGIGAKNIGHT_500_4000	(Intriguing. I would hear more of this tale, should the\nopportunity arise.)
A4_26310_PIKACHU_500_3000	We’re on a tight schedule right now, but I’ll tell you\nall about it later.
A4_2640_TIM_100_1000	These rocks weren’t here earlier.
A4_2640_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s examine ’em and see if we can figure out\nwhat happened.
A4_26400_BXMANMID01_100_1000	Whoa! A Pangoro! It’s not gonna attack me, is it?\nIt probably won’t...right?
A4_26400_GORONDA_100_1000	(Why’s this human so afraid of me?)
A4_26400_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s probably intimidated by your size, big guy...
A4_26410_NOKOCCHI_100_1000	(Phew... That was terrifying... Humans are so scary...)
A4_26410_GORONDA_100_1000	(Don’t like humans?)
A4_26410_NOKOCCHI_100_2000	(Not necessarily. I just get scared whenever they’re\nnear me.)
A4_2660_TIM_5000_1000	I should focus on investigating this area first.
A4_2665_PIKACHU_100_1000	If these rocks weren’t in our way, our\njob here would be so much easier...
A4_2665_PIKACHU_100_2000	If only there were some way to move them...
A4_2670_TIM_100_1000	Judging by the size of these footprints, I bet they’re\nRachel and Jessica’s. It looks like they ran up ahead\nbeyond the rocks.
A4_2670_PIKACHU_100_1000	Knowing which way they went is a big help.
A4_2680_TIM_100_1000	These rocks weren’t here earlier. It doesn’t seem like\nthey rolled down from anywhere, either.
A4_2680_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. We know they haven’t been here long, and\nthey look different from the other rocks nearby.\nA Pokémon must have caused this.
A4_2690_TIM_100_1000	These footprints are larger than Rachel and Jessica’s.\nThey might belong to a man.
A4_2690_PIKACHU_100_1000	They’re mixed in with Rachel and Jessica’s footprints,\nand I doubt they were made by a tourist...
A4_2690_TIM_100_2000	Do you think someone was going after Jessica?
A4_2690_PIKACHU_100_2000	We can’t rule it out.
A4_2700_TIM_100_1000	That’s a big Pokémon footprint. Judging by the depth,\nthe Pokémon was pretty heavy too.
A4_2700_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s not Pangoro’s footprint, and I don’t think it was\nmade by any of the other Pokémon living in the\nbamboo forest, either.
A4_2700_TIM_100_2000	If it was left by a Pokémon that came from elsewhere,\nthat might be somehow related to these rocks.
A4_2700_PIKACHU_100_2000	I think that’s safe to assume.
A4_2720_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s all there is to see here.
A4_2721_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve collected some important clues.
A4_2730_TIM_100_1000	We need to do something about these rocks so we\ncan find Rachel and Jessica.
A4_2730_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hmm... We can either ask the people in town for help,\nor find a Pokémon that can deal with ’em.
A4_2730_TIM_100_2000	A Pokémon, huh? I wonder if we could ask—
A4_2730_PIKACHU_100_2000	Pangoro, yeah! Should we go see him right now?
A4_2730_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_2730_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_2730_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. If there’s something you wanna do first, let’s head\nover to him when you’re done.
A4_2740_PIKACHU_100_1000	There you are. Heeey, Pangoro!
A4_2740_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro?
A4_2760_PIKACHU_100_1000	Woohoo! The view up here is amazing.
A4_2760_PIKACHU_100_2000	There’s a bunch of rocks blocking the path up ahead.\nCan you flex those muscles and clear the way for us,\nPangoro?
A4_2760_GORONDA_100_1000	(Sure thing.)
A4_2761_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro?
A4_2761_PIKACHU_100_1000	Should I ask for Pangoro’s help now?
A4_2761_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_2761_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_2761_PIKACHU_300_1000	All right, Pangoro! I’m counting on you.
A4_2761_GORONDA_300_1000	Goro gorooo!
A4_2761_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. I’ll give you a shout if I need your help again,\nPangoro.
A4_2761_GORONDA_400_1000	Goro!
A4_2765_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro?
A4_2765_PIKACHU_100_1000	Should I ask for Pangoro’s help now?
A4_2765_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_2765_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_2765_PIKACHU_300_1000	All right, Pangoro! I’m counting on you.
A4_2765_GORONDA_300_1000	Goro gorooo!
A4_2765_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. I’ll give you a shout if I need your help again,\nPangoro.
A4_2765_GORONDA_400_1000	Goro!
A4_2782_TIM_100_1000	Jessica said the charcoal kiln is across the\nbridge, right?
A4_2782_TIM_100_2000	If we can just get there somehow, we might be able to\nfind Rachel and Jessica.
A4_2782_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah... Huh? Hold on...
A4_2782_PIKACHU_100_2000	Tim! There’s another way to get to the other side of\nthe bridge!
A4_2782_PIKACHU_100_3000	It’s through the storage area!
A4_2782_TIM_100_3000	Huh? Where’s that?
A4_2782_PIKACHU_100_4000	It’s over that way up the hill!
A4_2785_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s up this hill!
A4_2790_TIM_100_1000	The charcoal kiln is up ahead past this bridge. I hope\nthat’s where Rachel and Jessica are...
A4_2790_PIKACHU_100_1000	Me too. Let’s find a way to get there.
A4_2795_PIKACHU_100_1000	This is it—we can get to the charcoal kiln from here!
A4_2795_TIM_100_1000	Nice work, Pikachu! But how did you know about this?
A4_2795_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’ve gone this way before.
A4_2795_TIM_100_2000	... ... ...
A4_2800_PIKACHU_100_1000	We can get to the other side of the bridge from here.\nNo doubt about it!
A4_2800_PIKACHU_100_2000	Should we go in now?
A4_2800_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_2800_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_2800_TIM_300_1000	OK, Pikachu, I trust you. Let’s go!
A4_2800_PIKACHU_300_1000	All right. Here we go!
A4_2800_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. If there’s something else you need to do first,\nlet’s go when you’re done.
A4_2810_TIM_100_1000	Well, this sure is a storage area. Nice that there are\nlights at least.
A4_2810_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s see if we can find anything useful.
A4_2820_GORONDA_100_1000	Gorooo.
A4_2820_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, we’ll ask for your help if we need it.
A4_2910_HARRY_100_1000	Right after I tried talking to those two suspicious guys,\nthe Lairon next to them started going berserk.
A4_2910_HARRY_100_2000	There’s no way those two weren’t responsible for\nits sudden change in behavior.
A4_2910_HARRY_100_3000	You think so too, right, Pikachu?
A4_2910_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Pika pika! Pikachu!
A4_2910_HARRY_100_4000	Yeah! You have every right to be angry!
A4_2910_HARRY_100_5000	Those guys better watch out... Once I find them, I’m\ntaking them straight to the police!
A4_2910_PIKACHUO_100_2000	Piiika!
A4_2910_HARRY_100_6000	That said, they probably got away already. I’d go\nchase ’em down, but Lairon’s outside...
A4_2910_PIKACHUO_100_3000	Pika?
A4_2910_HARRY_100_7000	Heh, don’t worry. I’m not out of ideas just yet! For\nnow, let’s find ourselves a safe way out of here.
A4_2910_HARRY_100_8000	I’ll set my sights on those two guys after that.
A4_2910_HARRY_100_9000	C’mon, Pikachu—let’s see if there’s another door\nthat’ll get us out of here.
A4_2910_PIKACHUO_100_4000	Pika!
A4_2920_HARRY_100_1000	Lairon is going berserk outside.
A4_2920_HARRY_100_2000	We’ll have to search for another exit.
A4_2930_HARRY_100_1000	It’s an iron gate. Surely it’s—nope. Locked.
A4_2930_HARRY_100_2000	What’s with everyone locking their gates today?!
A4_2930_HARRY_100_3000	There’s gotta be something we can do. Let’s see...
A4_2940_HARRY_100_1000	What can we find here?
A4_2950_HARRY_5000_1000	I should focus on investigating this area first.
A4_2960_HARRY_100_1000	This iron gate’s pretty sturdy. Locked tight, too.
A4_2960_HARRY_100_2000	There’s a lot of space over on the other side. That\nmust be where everything is stored.
A4_2960_HARRY_100_3000	I should’ve asked the boss for the key to open this\ngate too.
A4_2970_HARRY_100_1000	There’s a pretty big gap at the bottom. I wonder if I\ncan... Nope. Too tight.
A4_2970_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Pika pika?
A4_2970_HARRY_100_2000	Don’t worry, I’ll figure this thing out.
A4_2990_HARRY_100_1000	Is that...a key?
A4_2990_HARRY_100_2000	Maybe it’s a spare. Pretty careless of them to just\nleave it there, but I’m not gonna look a gift horse\nin the mouth.
A4_2990_HARRY_100_3000	I just gotta reach my hand out and...
A4_2990_HARRY_100_4000	Agh, I can’t reach it. If only there was a stick or\nsomething I could use... Hmm, what should I do?
A4_30000_BHMANOLD01_100_1000	Those are some pretty flowers.
A4_30005_BHMANOLD01_100_1000	This place is bustling!
A4_30010_BKWOMANMID01_100_1000	When will the dancing start?
A4_30015_BKWOMANMID01_100_1000	I’ve been waiting to see this performance!
A4_30020_BHWOMANMID01_100_1000	Where should we eat?
A4_30030_MIMILOP_100_1000	Lop!
A4_30040_BABOY01_100_1000	You’re still hungry?
A4_30050_YOUNGOOSE_100_1000	Yungooo.
A4_30060_DOTEKKOTSU01_100_1000	Gurrr!
A4_30080_BKWOMAN02_100_1000	Come get some super-spicy curry!
A4_30090_HOSHIGARISU_100_1000	Skwo!
A4_3010_HARRY_100_1000	I think I’m done checking out this area.
A4_30100_BHWOMANOLD01_100_1000	I’ve got all kinds of good stuff!
A4_30110_KIREIHANA01_100_1000	Som...
A4_30120_BKMANOLD01_100_1000	Time for a little rest.
A4_30140_EIEVUI_100_1000	Eevee?
A4_30150_BKWOMANOLD01_100_1000	There sure are a lot of shops...
A4_30152_KINOCOCO_100_1000	Shroo...
A4_30155_TAMAGETAKE_100_1000	Foon foooon!
A4_30155_TAMAGETAKE_100_2000	Foooongus!
A4_30160_BIPPA_100_1000	Bidoof!
A4_30180_DKAMONEGI_100_1000	Faaar!
A4_3020_HARRY_100_1000	OK, I think I’ve seen enough of this gate. Now, how\ndo I get that key?
A4_3020_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Pika pika?
A4_3020_HARRY_100_2000	You’re down to gimme a hand, huh?
A4_3020_PIKACHUO_100_2000	Pika! Pikachu!
A4_3020_HARRY_100_3000	Oh, that’s right! You could probably fit through that\ngap and get to the other side.
A4_3020_HARRY_100_4000	OK Pikachu, I want you to get that key.
A4_3020_HARRY_100_5000	It’s that little thing over there. See it? Once we get\nthat, we can open this gate.
A4_3020_PIKACHUO_100_3000	Pi... Pika?
A4_3020_HARRY_100_6000	I don’t think it understood that. I better try explaining\nstep by step.
A4_3020_HARRY_100_7000	First, I need Pikachu to get to the other side of\nthe gate.
A4_3020_HARRY_100_8000	How should I communicate that?
A4_3020_HARRY_200_1000	Should I try asking it again, or take a different\napproach...?
A4_3020_SEL_0_1000	Keep asking until Pikachu understands
A4_3020_SEL_0_2000	Point to the gap in the gate
A4_3020_HARRY_300_1000	Pikachu! Grab that key over there for me, would ya?
A4_3020_HARRY_400_1000	Pikachu! I want you to pop through that gap down\nthere and get to the other side of the gate!
A4_30260_OTACHI_100_1000	Tret!
A4_30270_DOTEKKOTSU01_100_1000	Gurrr!
A4_30280_DOTEKKOTSU02_100_1000	Gurrr?
A4_30330_MELECIE_100_1000	Caaarbiii?
A4_30340_BACHURU01_100_1000	Jooolt.
A4_30350_BACHURU02_100_1000	Jolt?!
A4_3060_HARRY_100_1000	Well, that didn’t work...
A4_3070_HARRY_100_1000	All right! Pikachu’s through the gap. Now, how should\nI explain the next step?
A4_3070_SEL_0_1000	Tell it verbally
A4_3070_SEL_0_2000	Show it the bamboo forest gate key
A4_3070_HARRY_300_1000	Pikachu! Think you can bring over that key?
A4_3070_HARRY_400_1000	Pikachu! See this? Look for the same thing\nand bring it over here, will ya?
A4_3090_HARRY_100_1000	Thanks, Pikachu! Now I can open this gate.
A4_3090_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Piiikachu!
A4_3120_HARRY_100_1000	Well, that didn’t work...
A4_3130_HARRY_100_1000	Now, let’s see if this key works...
A4_3130_HARRY_100_2000	Bingo! It opened!
A4_3135_HARRY_100_1000	ANOTHER gate? Well, lucky for me, I’ve got that key\nfrom earlier.
A4_3135_HARRY_100_2000	I’ll just give it a turn and...huh?
A4_3150_HARRY_100_1000	Why did it decide to take a nap right here?
A4_3150_HARRY_100_2000	Sorry, Graveler, but I’m gonna have to give this gate\na pretty hearty shove. Here goes!
A4_3150_HARRY_100_3000	Hrrrmph!
A4_3150_HARRY_100_4000	No dice... It won’t budge. That Graveler’s\nno featherweight...
A4_3150_HARRY_100_5000	Heeey, Graveler! Wake up, will ya?!
A4_3150_GOLONE_100_1000	... ... ...
A4_3150_HARRY_100_6000	It’s sound asleep. How can I get it to move?
A4_3160_HARRY_100_1000	I’ll see if I can find anything that might help.
A4_3170_HARRY_5000_1000	I should focus on investigating this area first.
A4_3180_HARRY_100_1000	This gate’s not locked, but I can’t open it with\nGraveler in the way.
A4_3180_HARRY_100_2000	I gotta figure out a way to get it to move...
A4_3190_HARRY_100_1000	There’s a gap down here too. I could have Pikachu\npop through it again.
A4_3190_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Pika pika!
A4_3190_HARRY_100_2000	Thanks, buddy. I’m countin’ on you.
A4_3200_HARRY_100_1000	It’s no use... Graveler’s fast asleep. I doubt it’ll wake\nup even if I shake it or tickle it.
A4_3200_HARRY_100_2000	How can I get it to move?
A4_3220_HARRY_100_1000	I see some small Berries... Those look like Chesto\nBerries. If I remember right, they can wake up a\nsleeping Pokémon.
A4_3230_HARRY_100_1000	I see some Berries with a thorny skin... Those look\nlike Durin Berries. If I remember right, they’re used\nto make Pokéblocks.
A4_3240_HARRY_100_1000	I see some Berries with stems... Those look like Wacan\nBerries. If I remember right, they can protect Pokémon\nfrom Electric-type attacks.
A4_3260_HARRY_100_1000	That’s all there is to see here.
A4_3270_HARRY_100_1000	Maybe I can use one of those Berries to make\nGraveler wake up.
A4_3270_HARRY_100_2000	I wonder if Pikachu could get a Berry for me...
A4_3270_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Pika!
A4_3270_HARRY_100_3000	You’ll do it? Thanks a million, Pikachu!
A4_3290_HARRY_100_1000	All right, now which Berry should I tell Pikachu to get?
A4_3290_SEL_0_1000	A Chesto Berry, which awakens sleeping\nPokémon
A4_3290_SEL_0_2000	A Durin Berry, which is used as an ingredient\nto make Pokéblocks
A4_3290_SEL_0_3000	A Wacan Berry, which provides protection\nfrom Electric-type attacks
A4_3290_HARRY_300_1000	That one, Pikachu! Grab a Chesto Berry, on the\nleft there!
A4_3290_HARRY_300_2000	One of the small Berries with the pointed ends!
A4_3290_HARRY_400_1000	That one, Pikachu! Grab a Durin Berry, on the\nright there!
A4_3290_HARRY_400_2000	One of the Berries with the jagged surfaces!
A4_3290_HARRY_500_1000	That one, Pikachu! Grab a Wacan Berry, in the\nmiddle there!
A4_3290_HARRY_500_2000	One of the Berries with the droopy stems!
A4_3310_HARRY_100_1000	OK, I got the Berry! Now I just need to give it\nto Graveler.
A4_3310_HARRY_300_1000	A Chesto Berry should wake it right up.
A4_3310_GOLONE_400_1000	... ... ...
A4_3310_HARRY_400_1000	Guess that Berry won’t wake it up...
A4_3315_GOLONE_100_1000	Gra...graaav?
A4_3315_HARRY_100_1000	Hey, it woke up!
A4_3315_HARRY_100_2000	Hey there, Graveler. Sorry for the rubble-rousing, but\nwould you mind moving over just a bit so I can get\nthis gate open?
A4_3315_GOLONE_100_2000	Grav graaav.
A4_3315_HARRY_100_3000	Thanks for the help, Graveler.
A4_3315_GOLONE_100_3000	Graaav.
A4_3315_HARRY_100_4000	And thanks for the assist, Pikachu!
A4_3315_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Pika!
A4_3330_HARRY_100_1000	I’ll have Pikachu grab a different Berry.
A4_3340_GOLONE_100_1000	Graaav?
A4_3340_HARRY_100_1000	Sorry I woke you up.
A4_3340_HARRY_100_2000	I gotta say, you’re in a much better mood than I\nexpected. I was prepared for the worst!
A4_3340_GOLONE_100_2000	Grav.
A4_3340_GOLONE_200_1000	Graaav.
A4_3340_HARRY_200_1000	I gotta say, you’re in a much better mood than I\nexpected. I was prepared for the worst!
A4_3342_HARRY_100_1000	Looks like there’s nowhere else to go.
A4_3342_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Piiikaaa...
A4_3342_HARRY_100_2000	Don’t tell me we’ve hit a dead end... Hm?
A4_3342_HARRY_100_3000	Is that...an elevator?
A4_3342_HARRY_100_4000	Aha! This must be the storage area I heard about!
A4_3342_HARRY_100_5000	Which would make this elevator the one the ol’\ncharcoal shop master is always fixing.
A4_3342_HARRY_100_6000	Heh, how’s that for luck! Saved myself a trip.
A4_3342_PIKACHUO_100_2000	Piiika? Pikachu?
A4_3342_HARRY_100_7000	This is our ticket out, Pikachu! We can use this\nelevator to get back up to the ground level.
A4_3342_PIKACHUO_100_3000	Piiikachu!
A4_3342_HARRY_100_8000	OK, let’s check this thing out and get back up\nabove ground!
A4_3343_HARRY_100_1000	It’s a power unit. There’s a machine inside that sends\nelectricity to the elevator.
A4_3343_HARRY_100_2000	There doesn’t seem to be any major damage, but the\nelectricity isn’t flowing properly.
A4_3343_HARRY_100_3000	This is probably why the elevator keeps\nbreaking down.
A4_3343_HARRY_100_4000	Can’t imagine the charcoal master helped much by\nwhacking it, either.
A4_3343_HARRY_200_1000	It’s a machine that sends electricity to the elevator.\nThere doesn’t seem to be any major damage, but the\nelectricity isn’t flowing properly.
A4_3343_HARRY_200_2000	The outer part’s pretty dented. I’m guessing that’s a\nresult of the charcoal master’s, uh...“drumming.”
A4_3345_HARRY_100_1000	These are the elevator buttons. There’s one for going\nup, and one for going down.
A4_3345_HARRY_100_2000	The power’s on the fritz, so nothing happens when I\npress one. If I wanna get them working, I’m gonna\nhave to get the electricity flowing again.
A4_3345_HARRY_100_3000	There’s light coming in from above, so I’m pretty sure\nthe elevator will take us back outside.
A4_3345_HARRY_200_1000	These are the elevator buttons. There’s no electricity\nrunning, so I’ll need to fix that to get them working.
A4_3347_HARRY_100_1000	If I wanna get the elevator working again, I think I just\nneed to fix the flow of electricity.
A4_3347_HARRY_100_2000	Once I do that, we can get back up to ground level!
A4_3347_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Pikachu!
A4_3350_HARRY_100_1000	The question now is, how do I fix the electricity?
A4_3350_HARRY_100_2000	This being a storage area and all, I figured they’d at\nleast have some tools or spare parts lying around...
A4_3350_HARRY_100_3000	Hmmm... What should I do?
A4_3350_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Pika pika?
A4_3350_HARRY_100_4000	The electricity’s not flowing properly. The charcoal\nmaster’s approach has been to just give the machine\na good smack, and that seems to do the job.
A4_3350_HARRY_100_5000	It’s clearly not a permanent solution, but something\nabout the shock of that initial impact seems to get\nthe electricity flowing again.
A4_3350_PIKACHUO_100_2000	Pika pika! Pikachu!
A4_3350_HARRY_100_6000	Oh! Sorry, buddy. I was just thinking out loud, and—
A4_3350_HARRY_100_7000	Ah! That’s right!
A4_3350_HARRY_100_8000	I’m not in this alone—I’ve got you here to help\nme, Pikachu!
A4_3350_PIKACHUO_100_3000	Pika?
A4_3350_HARRY_100_9000	You see this power unit? I want you to use an\nElectric-type move on it!
A4_3350_PIKACHUO_100_4000	Pika. Pika pika.
A4_3350_HARRY_100_10000	The electricity might start flowing properly if you\ngive it a good jolt.
A4_3350_HARRY_100_11000	You think you can do that, Pikachu?
A4_3350_PIKACHUO_100_5000	Piiika. Pikachu!
A4_3350_HARRY_200_1000	OK! You ready to help me out?
A4_3350_SEL_0_1000	Thunderbolt
A4_3350_SEL_0_2000	Tail Whip
A4_3350_SEL_0_3000	Quick Attack
A4_3350_HARRY_300_1000	Do your thing, Pikachu!
A4_3350_HARRY_400_1000	Do your thing, Pikachu!
A4_3350_HARRY_500_1000	Do your thing, Pikachu!
A4_3400_HARRY_100_1000	I guess that wasn’t the right move...
A4_3420_HARRY_100_1000	Finally—fresh air!
A4_3420_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Pikaaa. ♪
A4_3420_HARRY_100_2000	Awesome work, Pikachu! First you help Pancham, and\nthen you go and fix the elevator. Is there anything you\ncan’t do?!
A4_3420_HARRY_100_3000	Seriously though, I couldn’t have come this far without\nyou. Thanks, Pikachu.
A4_3420_PIKACHUO_100_2000	Pikachu.
A4_3430_HARRY_100_1000	We finally found our way out. No need for us to go\nback down there.
A4_3440_HARRY_100_1000	We did it, Pikachu! We made it to the charcoal kiln!
A4_3440_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Pika pika.
A4_3440_HARRY_100_2000	I was told this is where the berserk\nPokémon appeared...
A4_3440_HARRY_100_3000	Investigating that incident’s the whole reason\nI’m here.
A4_3440_HARRY_100_4000	We ran into a berserk Pokémon on the way\nhere, too...
A4_3440_PIKACHUO_100_2000	Pika.
A4_3440_HARRY_100_5000	I learned something from that encounter, at least.
A4_3440_HARRY_100_6000	Humans definitely have something to do with the\nberserk Pokémon.
A4_3440_PIKACHUO_100_3000	Piiika.
A4_3440_HARRY_100_7000	Lemme think back on what I’ve seen so far: two\nsuspicious guys, and a Lairon that went berserk right\nin front of us...
A4_3440_SEL_0_1000	The two suspicious guys
A4_3440_SEL_0_2000	The Lairon that went berserk
A4_3440_HARRY_300_1000	Those guys seemed very flustered when they saw me.
A4_3440_HARRY_300_2000	They didn’t seem like locals to me. <color=#F39800FF>They probably\ncame here from somewhere else.</color>
A4_3440_PIKACHUO_300_1000	Pika! Pika!
A4_3440_HARRY_300_3000	Judging by the way Pikachu reacted to ’em, I’m\npretty sure they had something to do with Lairon\ngoing berserk.
A4_3440_HARRY_400_1000	The Lairon was calm when I first saw those two guys.
A4_3440_HARRY_400_2000	<color=#F39800FF>But once they started running away, Lairon\nwent berserk.</color>
A4_3440_HARRY_400_3000	Did it go berserk because it was scared of us, or for\nsome other reason...?
A4_3440_PIKACHUO_400_1000	Piiika!
A4_3440_HARRY_400_4000	Lairon’s eyes caught my attention too.
A4_3440_HARRY_400_5000	Its eyes are usually light blue, <color=#F39800FF>but they were red when\nit started going berserk</color>. Something about that feels\noff to me.
A4_3440_PIKACHUO_400_2000	Pika pika.
A4_3445_HARRY_100_1000	Well, I think that’s about all I’ve got to ponder. Time\nfor some deduction!
A4_3450_HARRY_100_1000	Before I go investigate anywhere else, I should\norganize my thoughts and make some deductions\nabout Lairon.
A4_3460_HARRY_100_1000	Before I go investigate anywhere else, I should\norganize my thoughts and make some deductions\nabout Lairon.
A4_3470_HARRY_100_1000	This must be the bamboo charcoal. It actually looks\npretty cool. I should buy some on my way home—it\nsounds like it’ll come in handy for all kinds of things.
A4_3480_HARRY_100_1000	If those two are really the ones making Pokémon\ngo berserk, then—
A4_3480_PIKACHUO_100_1000	Pika! Pika pika!
A4_3480_HARRY_100_2000	What’s wrong?
A4_3480_SECRETKODORA_100_1000	Laaaiiirooon!
A4_3480_HARRY_100_3000	Seriously?!
A4_35000_YOUNGOOSE_100_1000	(It’s so noisy.)
A4_35010_DOTEKKOTSU01_100_1000	(Argh, I’m so busy!)
A4_35020_MELECIE_100_1000	(Whatcha doing here?)
A4_35030_BACHURU01_100_1000	(Mmm! Tasty electricity!)
A4_35040_BACHURU02_100_1000	(What’s going on?!)
A4_3620_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oof... I fell asleep again?
A4_3620_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh, hey Tim. What’s with that look? Come onnn, you\nworry too much!
A4_3620_TIM_100_1000	How are you NOT concerned about this, Pikachu?!
A4_3620_TIM_100_2000	You keep collapsing out of nowhere. Aren’t you at all\nanxious about what might be causing that?!
A4_3620_TIM_100_3000	Do you have any idea how worried we’ve all been?!
A4_3620_PIKACHU_100_3000	... ... ...
A4_3620_PIKACHU_100_4000	You’re right, Tim. I’m sorry.
A4_3620_PIKACHU_100_5000	I was trying to downplay it to keep you all from\nworrying, but I guess that backfired.
A4_3620_TIM_100_4000	Sorry, Pikachu... I didn’t mean to go off on you\nlike that.
A4_3620_PIKACHU_100_6000	No, I needed to hear it. I’ll get myself checked out\nafter we finish this investigation.
A4_3620_PIKACHU_100_7000	But for now, we gotta focus on finding Rachel and\nJessica. Let’s hurry up and go!
A4_3620_TIM_100_5000	W-wait! We can’t just go rushing in. We don’t know\nwhat’s in here.
A4_3620_PIKACHU_100_8000	Don’t worry. I’ve been here before with Harry.
A4_3620_PIKACHU_100_9000	It’s safe in here, and there’s an elevator in the back.\nWe won’t get lost.
A4_3620_TIM_100_6000	Your dream jogged more memories about this place,\nhuh? Mind filling me in?
A4_3620_SEL_0_1000	About you and Dad...
A4_3620_SEL_0_2000	About the storage area...
A4_3620_SEL_0_3000	About the elevator...
A4_3620_TIM_300_1000	You met Dad in the bamboo forest, right? Did you\ntwo come here next?
A4_3620_PIKACHU_300_1000	Pretty much. Things got pretty hairy after I gave\nPancham its medicine...
A4_3620_PIKACHU_300_2000	Harry and I encountered a berserk Pokémon, and we\nended up here after we ran away.
A4_3620_TIM_300_2000	You had to run? What happened?
A4_3620_PIKACHU_300_3000	I had Pikachu look after Pancham, and I headed\nin the direction of the roaring.
A4_3620_TIM_300_3000	(He...what? Sounds like his memories are jumbled\nagain.)
A4_3620_PIKACHU_300_4000	As I was heading toward where the loud roar came\nfrom, I saw Hoothoot flying away as fast as its wings\ncould carry it.
A4_3620_PIKACHU_300_5000	I knew right away that Hoothoot must have\nencountered a berserk Pokémon.
A4_3620_PIKACHU_300_6000	<color=#F39800FF>I wanted to confirm it, though, so I climbed up a\nhuge boulder and headed toward where Hoothoot\nhad come flying from.</color>
A4_3620_PIKACHU_300_7000	<color=#F39800FF>When I saw Harry heading that way, I scrambled up\nthe boulder to catch up with him and left Pancham\nbehind.</color>
A4_3620_TIM_300_4000	Huh...? This isn’t quite making sense...
A4_3620_PIKACHU_300_8000	After Harry and I climbed the boulder, we ran into\nthese two shady guys and a berserk Pokémon.
A4_3620_PIKACHU_300_9000	The berserk Pokémon started attacking us, so\nwe ran away and ended up stumbling into this\nstorage area.
A4_3620_TIM_300_5000	(I’m not sure how accurate his memory is for some\nparts of that story...)
A4_3620_TIM_300_6000	(I guess the one consistent thing is that they escaped\nthe berserk Pokémon by running into this storage\narea...)
A4_3620_PIKACHU_400_1000	The people of Bamboo Borough use this storage area.
A4_3620_PIKACHU_400_2000	Some Pokémon live here, but it’s generally a\nsafe place.
A4_3620_TIM_400_1000	A storage area, huh. I guess that’s why it’s such a\nsturdy structure.
A4_3620_PIKACHU_500_1000	There’s an elevator up ahead that we can use to get\nto ground level.
A4_3620_PIKACHU_500_2000	It’ll let us out onto the other side of the bridge, which\nis perfect.
A4_3620_PIKACHU_500_3000	The power doesn’t always work, but I know how to\nfix that!
A4_3620_TIM_500_1000	Wow, really? I guess we’re covered, then.
A4_3620_PIKACHU_500_4000	Uh...yeah. Totally.
A4_3621_PIKACHU_100_1000	Anyway, we can get outta here if we just follow the\npath beyond the gate. I know exactly what to do!
A4_3621_TIM_100_1000	It sounds straightforward, but we should still\nbe careful.
A4_3621_TIM_100_2000	I’m worried about your condition.
A4_3621_PIKACHU_100_2000	I appreciate it. Now let’s go find Rachel and Jessica!
A4_3621_TIM_100_3000	Wait a second. I want to organize my thoughts first.
A4_3625_TIM_100_1000	Hmm...
A4_3625_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey Tim, where ya goin’?
A4_3625_TIM_100_2000	Bwuh?! Sorry, I was lost in my thoughts.
A4_3625_PIKACHU_100_2000	Heh, no worries. Happens to the best of us.
A4_3630_GORONDA_100_1000	Gorooo...
A4_3630_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m fine. No need to worry about me.
A4_3635_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, let’s head further into the storage area.
A4_3635_TIM_100_1000	Sounds good.
A4_3637_GORONDA_100_1000	Gorooo.
A4_3637_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thanks! If I need help, you’ll be the first one I ask.
A4_3640_PIKACHU_100_1000	This metal gate’s locked, but we’ve got nothing to\nworry about.
A4_3640_PIKACHU_100_2000	I can fit through the gaps at the bottom and search\nfor a key on the other side.
A4_3640_TIM_100_1000	This gate doesn’t seem to be locked, actually. See?
A4_3640_PIKACHU_100_3000	Huh?! Wow, my clever solution fizzled into nothing...\nHmph. Folks around here really oughta be more\ncareful about leaving things unlocked...
A4_3640_TIM_100_2000	Aww, don’t worry about it—the important thing is that\nwe can get through without any trouble!
A4_3650_TIM_100_1000	Pikachu, what’s up with these huge rocks all over\nthe place?
A4_3650_PIKACHU_100_1000	These weren’t around the last time I was here...\nWhere the heck did they come from?
A4_3650_PIKACHU_100_2000	Well, lucky for us, I know exactly who to ask for help\nwith this kind of stuff.
A4_3660_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro?
A4_3660_PIKACHU_100_1000	Tim, should we ask for Pangoro’s help?
A4_3660_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_3660_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_3660_PIKACHU_300_1000	Let’s do this, Pangoro!
A4_3660_GORONDA_300_1000	Gorooo!
A4_3660_PIKACHU_400_1000	We’ve still got a couple things to look into, so we’ll\nask for your help later.
A4_3660_GORONDA_400_1000	Goro.
A4_3665_TIM_100_1000	We need to do something about these big rocks.
A4_3665_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. Let’s go ask for help!
A4_3680_TIM_100_1000	It’s a Diggersby. What’s it doing in here?
A4_3680_HORUDO_100_1000	Dig diiiiiig.
A4_3680_PIKACHU_100_1000	He said something about artistic creations.
A4_3680_TIM_100_2000	You mean, things like paintings and pottery?
A4_3680_PIKACHU_100_2000	Probably?
A4_3680_PIKACHU_100_3000	All I know is that Diggersby calls those big rocks and\nholes in the ground its “artistic creations.”
A4_3680_HORUDO_100_2000	Dig dig dig!
A4_3680_PIKACHU_100_4000	How do we like ’em? Well, we could’ve gotten here a\nlot faster if they hadn’t been blocking our way.
A4_3680_TIM_100_3000	Oh well... It’s not like we can tell Diggersby to just\ngive up its hobby.
A4_3680_HORUDO_200_1000	Dig diiiiiig.
A4_3680_PIKACHU_200_1000	I know you’re proud of setting up all these rocks and\nholes...I just dunno if I’d call that “art,” per se...
A4_3690_HORUDO_100_1000	Diiig...
A4_3690_TIM_100_1000	This Diggersby seems a little down.
A4_3690_PIKACHU_100_1000	Maybe ’cause we buried its artistic creations.
A4_3690_TIM_100_2000	Well, now I feel guilty!
A4_3690_PIKACHU_100_2000	We had no other choice—they were in our way.
A4_3690_HORUDO_100_2000	Dig diiig!
A4_3690_PIKACHU_100_3000	You’re gonna make something even better next time?!\nUh-oh... There’s a fire in its eyes.
A4_3690_TIM_100_3000	I’m glad to hear you’re motivated, but make sure your\nnext art installation doesn’t become a safety hazard.
A4_3695_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro?
A4_3695_PIKACHU_100_1000	Should I ask for Pangoro’s help now?
A4_3695_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_3695_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_3695_PIKACHU_300_1000	All right, Pangoro! I’m counting on you.
A4_3695_GORONDA_300_1000	Goro gorooo!
A4_3695_PIKACHU_400_1000	I’ve still got a couple things to look into, so I’ll ask for\nyour help later, Pangoro.
A4_3695_GORONDA_400_1000	Goro.
A4_3700_PIKACHU_100_1000	This is the elevator’s power unit. It generates the\nelectricity that keeps the whole thing running.
A4_3700_TIM_100_1000	It looks pretty banged up.
A4_3700_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, it used to break down all the time. The master\nof the charcoal shop had to whack it with bamboo to\nget it running again.
A4_3700_TIM_100_2000	Well, that explains all the dents...
A4_3700_TIM_100_3000	I’m surprised to hear that hitting it actually worked.
A4_3700_PIKACHU_100_3000	Nah. It still kept breaking, so Harry and I fixed it up.
A4_3700_TIM_100_4000	Wow! You two did that together?
A4_3700_PIKACHU_100_4000	Yep! And these dents are just how we left ’em. That\nmeans the ol’ man hasn’t had to whack it back into\nrunning order ever since.
A4_3700_TIM_100_5000	So it’s been working smoothly since you and Dad\nfixed it? Then we shouldn’t have any trouble with it.
A4_3700_PIKACHU_100_5000	Yep. And it’s a good thing for me.
A4_3700_TIM_100_6000	What do you mean?
A4_3700_PIKACHU_100_6000	Well, fixing it up required using Electric-type moves...\nActually, never mind—forget I said anything.
A4_3700_PIKACHU_100_7000	Anyway, let’s take this elevator back outside!
A4_3715_PIKACHU_100_1000	You ready, Tim?!
A4_3715_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_3715_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_3715_TIM_300_1000	Looks like these elevator buttons are working.
A4_3715_PIKACHU_300_1000	I guess none of the memories that came back to me\nwill come in handy after all...
A4_3715_TIM_300_2000	That’s not true. They helped us get all the way here.\nNow we’ve just gotta ride the elevator up and...
A4_3715_SECRETGOLONYA_300_1000	Gole gole! Gooolem!
A4_3715_GORONDA_300_1000	Gorooo! Goro?!
A4_3715_TIM_300_3000	It came from above!
A4_3715_PIKACHU_300_2000	This can’t be good... Let’s hurry on up!
A4_3715_TIM_400_1000	Wait, there’s something I want to do first.
A4_3715_PIKACHU_400_2000	OK. When you’re ready, let’s take the elevator up to\nground level.
A4_3722_PIKACHU_100_1000	That roar came from somewhere nearby. Keep your\nguard up, Tim.
A4_3722_TIM_100_1000	Right. Let’s go!
A4_3723_TIM_100_1000	This is NOT where we should be going right now.\nWe need to find Rachel and Jessica—and fast!
A4_3724_PIKACHU_100_1000	Tim and I will go assess the situation first. Could you\nwait here?
A4_3724_GORONDA_100_1000	Gorooo.
A4_3724_PIKACHU_200_1000	Tim and I will go assess the situation first. Could you\nwait here?
A4_3724_GORONDA_200_1000	Gorooo.
A4_3725_TIM_100_1000	Wait... Is that—
A4_3725_TIM_100_2000	Rachel! Jessica!
A4_3725_PIKACHU_100_1000	Tim, wait!
A4_3725_PIKACHU_100_2000	That guy...
A4_3750_PIKACHU_100_1000	Phew! That was pretty intense. I’m glad he took off.
A4_3750_TIM_100_1000	Pikachu! Pangoro!
A4_3750_TIM_100_2000	That looked like a tough opponent to handle. Are you\ntwo OK?
A4_3750_PIKACHU_100_2000	Pfft, that was nothin’ for us! Right, Pangoro?
A4_3750_GORONDA_100_1000	Gorooo!
A4_3750_TIM_100_3000	Haha! I get the feeling you two could handle just\nabout anything.
A4_3750_TIM_100_4000	It seems like Rachel and Jessica are OK too.
A4_3750_PIKACHU_100_3000	That’s great to hear.
A4_3750_PIKACHU_100_4000	We should go check in with ’em.
A4_3805_TIM_100_1000	Jessica, are you OK?
A4_3805_JESSICA_100_1000	I just...why...
A4_3805_TIM_100_2000	... ... ...
A4_3805_PIKACHU_100_1000	She doesn’t look hurt, but she’s pretty shaken up.
A4_3805_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s wait until she’s had some time to process.
A4_3805_TIM_100_3000	Yeah...
A4_3805_JESSICA_200_1000	I just...why...
A4_3805_TIM_200_1000	... ... ...
A4_3805_PIKACHU_200_1000	She seems pretty shaken up. Let’s give her some time\nto process.
A4_3820_JESSICA_100_1000	That man in black from earlier... It sounded like he\nwas with some group called “Unitas.”
A4_3820_RACHEL_100_1000	Unitas? What’s that?
A4_3820_JESSICA_100_2000	He knew I was carrying something important too...
A4_3820_JESSICA_100_3000	What does this all mean?!
A4_3820_RACHEL_100_2000	Breathe, Jessica—it’s OK. You’re safe now.
A4_3820_JESSICA_100_4000	I just... I can’t believe this is happening.
A4_3820_TIM_100_1000	I understand it might be difficult to talk about,\nJessica, but do you think you could answer\nsome questions?
A4_3820_JESSICA_100_5000	Sure... I can do that.
A4_3820_SEL_0_1000	What do you know about Unitas?
A4_3820_SEL_0_2000	What’s the important thing Unitas stole\nfrom you?
A4_3820_TIM_300_1000	The man in black mentioned something called\n“Unitas.” Can you tell me more about that?
A4_3820_JESSICA_300_1000	Yes. You remember that project I told you about\nbefore? The one Emma launched with the lab and\nRyme City?
A4_3820_JESSICA_300_2000	It was called the Unitas Project.
A4_3820_TIM_300_2000	Huh?! They have the same name?
A4_3820_JESSICA_300_3000	It surprised me as well.
A4_3820_RACHEL_300_1000	But...why? Why would they use the same name as\nMama’s project?
A4_3820_PIKACHU_300_1000	Jessica told us before that the project was canceled,\nand the lab was shut down.
A4_3820_RACHEL_300_2000	Maybe that guy used to work at the lab back when\nit was still running. Do you remember ever seeing\nhim, Jessica?
A4_3820_JESSICA_300_4000	No, I’ve never seen him before. He knew who I\nwas, though...
A4_3820_TIM_300_3000	So that man in black just now was with that\nUnitas organization...
A4_3820_TIM_300_4000	There’s no way this is all a coincidence.
A4_3820_PIKACHU_300_2000	Agreed. There’s gotta be something behind all this.
A4_3820_TIM_400_1000	Jessica, what did that Unitas guy steal from you?
A4_3820_JESSICA_400_1000	Research data. Emma collected it at the lab.
A4_3820_RACHEL_400_1000	What? You were just carrying that around?
A4_3820_JESSICA_400_2000	Yes, I kept it on a thumb drive. I thought of it like a\ngood luck charm.
A4_3820_RACHEL_400_2000	But why? Were you planning to continue\nher research?
A4_3820_JESSICA_400_3000	No. Quite the opposite, actually.
A4_3820_JESSICA_400_4000	That research data could spell danger for both\nhumans and Pokémon.
A4_3820_JESSICA_400_5000	I figured I should hold on to it to keep that\nfrom happening.
A4_3820_RACHEL_400_3000	I can’t believe my mom would research something\nso dangerous...
A4_3820_JESSICA_400_6000	The research itself was about how people and\nPokémon could live together in harmony.
A4_3820_JESSICA_400_7000	Emma was specifically focused on the possible\ninteractions between Pokémon and human\nconsciousnesses.
A4_3820_JESSICA_400_8000	In the middle her research, she made an unexpected\ndiscovery...
A4_3820_JESSICA_400_9000	A way for a human to take full control of a Pokémon’s\nconsciousness—or even fuse their own consciousness\nwith it.
A4_3820_TIM_400_2000	That’s horrifying...
A4_3820_JESSICA_400_10000	Emma thought so too—that’s why she kept her data\nhidden from everyone at the lab.
A4_3820_JESSICA_400_11000	I was the only person she told where she kept it.
A4_3820_RACHEL_400_4000	She must have really trusted you, Jessica.
A4_3820_JESSICA_400_12000	Yes...but I couldn’t fully understand all the data. It was\na bit above my level of expertise.
A4_3820_JESSICA_400_13000	When the lab shut down after the R incident, I took\nthe research data with me.
A4_3820_RACHEL_400_5000	And now that Unitas goon has it...
A4_3820_JESSICA_400_14000	I should have deleted it when I had the chance, but I\ncouldn’t bring myself to do it...
A4_3820_RACHEL_400_6000	It’s OK—I understand. Dr. Myers meant a lot to you,\nand...you wanted to remember her.
A4_3820_JESSICA_400_15000	Yes... Thank you, Rachel.
A4_3820_PIKACHU_400_1000	Hmm... Unitas must’ve known what was in that\nresearch data.
A4_3840_PIKACHU_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>I saw these two suspicious-looking guys in the\nbamboo forest, and when I tried to reason with\nthem, they were having none of it.</color>
A4_3840_PIKACHU_100_2000	And <color=#F39800FF>Harry couldn’t understand me </color>when I tried\ntelling him.
A4_3840_PIKACHU_100_3000	Those guys suddenly took off runnin’, and that’s when\n<color=#F39800FF>Lairon attacked us</color>.
A4_3840_TIM_100_1000	Did Lairon go berserk because of R?
A4_3840_PIKACHU_100_4000	Yeah. I didn’t know about R at that point, but the vial\nI found then was a big clue.
A4_3840_TIM_100_2000	I see... By the way, what do you mean when you say\nyou tried to reason with them?
A4_3840_PIKACHU_100_5000	I wanted to suss them out first by talking to them.\nRunning straight in didn’t seem like the right move.
A4_3840_PIKACHU_100_6000	They <color=#F39800FF>tried to play dumb</color>—said something about\nharvesting bamboo shoots.
A4_3840_PIKACHU_100_7000	Then they used some R to make Lairon go berserk.
A4_3840_TIM_100_3000	Hmm...
A4_3840_PIKACHU_100_8000	What’s up, Tim? You haven’t forgotten about R,\nhave you?
A4_3840_PIKACHU_100_9000	What’s buggin’ you?
A4_3840_TIM_100_4000	Well... Let me ask again.
A4_3840_TIM_100_5000	You said you tried to reason with those two\nsuspicious men?
A4_3840_PIKACHU_100_10000	Yeah, of course.
A4_3850_RACHEL_100_1000	What do I do? I wonder if I should tell Papa about\nUnitas...
A4_3850_TIM_100_1000	Yeah. If there’s a good time for you two to talk,\nI think you should tell him.
A4_3850_RACHEL_200_1000	I’ll ask about Unitas next time I see him.
A4_3860_JESSICA_100_1000	All I wanted was to keep the research data from\nbeing misused... Taking it out of the lab with me\nwas a mistake. I should’ve just deleted it.
A4_3860_JESSICA_100_2000	So many people have been put in danger because I\nwas carrying it around...
A4_3860_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Jessica.
A4_3860_PIKACHU_100_2000	You shouldn’t beat yourself up over whether you\ncould’ve or should’ve done anything differently.
A4_3860_PIKACHU_100_3000	What’s important is that your choice reflected how\ndeeply you care about both people and Pokémon.
A4_3860_PIKACHU_100_4000	After hearing everything you’ve had to say, I don’t\nthink you made the wrong choice at all.
A4_3860_JESSICA_100_3000	Awww, is he trying to cheer me up?
A4_3860_JESSICA_100_4000	Thanks, Pikachu.
A4_3860_JESSICA_200_1000	Did I really make the right decision back then?
A4_3870_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro?
A4_3870_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s asking if you’re OK.
A4_3870_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, I’m all right. Thanks, Pangoro—I was just caught\nup in my thoughts.
A4_3870_GORONDA_100_2000	Goro.
A4_3870_TIM_200_1000	I’m OK, Pangoro.
A4_3870_GORONDA_200_1000	Goro.
A4_3880_CHARCOALDISCIPLE02_100_1000	Thank you for getting that horrible man to leave.
A4_3880_CHARCOALDISCIPLE02_100_2000	I honestly WANTED to help...
A4_3880_CHARCOALDISCIPLE02_100_3000	but that Golem gave me such an awful look that I\nfroze up.
A4_3880_TIM_100_1000	I’m just glad you kept safe.
A4_3880_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, getting involved could’ve gotten you hurt—and\nI’m sure the master of the charcoal shop has enough\nto worry about already.
A4_3890_TIM_100_1000	Looks like they just finished making this batch of\nbamboo charcoal.
A4_3890_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, here’s where they sort the good lumps from the\nbad. It’s important to only use high-quality charcoal!
A4_3890_TIM_100_2000	How do you even know these things?
A4_3890_PIKACHU_100_2000	After I finished investigating the berserk Pokémon\ncase, I got kinda curious—so I did some research.
A4_3900_TIM_100_1000	There’s no need for us to go in there.
A4_3910_TIM_100_1000	There’s no need for us to go in there.
A4_3920_TIM_100_1000	There’s no need for us to go this way.
A4_40010_TIM_100_1000	I can’t shake this feeling that something seems off\nabout Pikachu’s story.
A4_40010_TIM_100_2000	Maybe I should stop for a moment and pinpoint\nwhat’s bothering me about it...
A4_40010_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_40010_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_40010_TIM_300_1000	Pikachu said he borrowed the key to the gate.
A4_40010_TIM_300_2000	But he also said he met Dad in the bamboo forest.
A4_40010_TIM_300_3000	Something about those two events doesn’t quite\nadd up.
A4_40010_TIM_400_1000	No, never mind. I’ll think about it after I’ve relaxed\nfor a bit.
A4_40020_TIM_100_1000	I can’t shake this feeling that something seems off\nabout Pikachu’s story.
A4_40020_TIM_100_2000	Maybe I should stop for a moment and pinpoint\nwhat’s bothering me about it...
A4_40020_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_40020_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_40020_TIM_300_1000	Pikachu said he was protecting Pancham.
A4_40020_TIM_300_2000	So how was he able to go look for medicine at the\nsame time?
A4_40020_TIM_300_3000	I’m not sure why, but that just seems off to me...
A4_40020_TIM_400_1000	No, never mind. I’ll think about it after I’ve relaxed\nfor a bit.
A4_40030_TIM_100_1000	I can’t shake this feeling that something seems off\nabout Pikachu’s story.
A4_40030_TIM_100_2000	Maybe I should stop for a moment and pinpoint\nwhat’s bothering me about it...
A4_40030_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_40030_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_40030_TIM_300_1000	What was up with Pikachu’s story just now?
A4_40030_TIM_300_2000	He said he climbed the same boulder twice...
A4_40030_TIM_300_3000	I get that he climbed it once to catch up with Dad,\nbut why’d he do it the other time?
A4_40030_TIM_400_1000	No, never mind. I’ll think about it after I’ve relaxed\nfor a bit.
A4_40040_TIM_100_1000	I can’t shake this feeling that something seems off\nabout Pikachu’s story.
A4_40040_TIM_100_2000	Maybe I should stop for a moment and pinpoint\nwhat’s bothering me about it...
A4_40040_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_40040_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_40040_TIM_300_1000	Pikachu said he talked to those suspicious men.
A4_40040_TIM_300_2000	But they shouldn’t have been able to understand what\nhe was saying...
A4_40040_TIM_300_3000	So I wonder why he said that...
A4_40040_TIM_400_1000	No, never mind. I’ll think about it after I’ve relaxed\nfor a bit.
A4_40050_HARRY_100_1000	I’m feeling kinda stuck.
A4_40050_HARRY_100_2000	Maybe I oughta put my thoughts in order?
A4_40050_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_40050_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_40050_HARRY_300_1000	I need to convince the master of the charcoal shop to\nlend me the key—but how?
A4_40050_HARRY_300_2000	Maybe talking to people who know him will help me\nthink of something.
A4_40050_HARRY_300_3000	I’ll start with the other Bamboo Borough shopkeepers.
A4_40050_HARRY_300_4000	They might’ve learned a thing or two about the guy\nfrom doing business with him.
A4_40050_HARRY_400_1000	Nah. For now, gathering info’s my top priority.
A4_40060_HARRY_100_1000	I’m feeling kinda stuck.
A4_40060_HARRY_100_2000	Maybe I oughta put my thoughts in order?
A4_40060_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_40060_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_40060_HARRY_300_1000	What happened in the bamboo forest?
A4_40060_HARRY_300_2000	I’ve gotta investigate every inch of the scene.
A4_40060_HARRY_300_3000	I’m sure I can figure it out from the clues left behind.
A4_40060_HARRY_400_1000	Nah. For now, gathering info’s my top priority.
A4_40070_HARRY_100_1000	I’m feeling kinda stuck.
A4_40070_HARRY_100_2000	Maybe I oughta put my thoughts in order?
A4_40070_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_40070_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_40070_HARRY_300_1000	I’m gonna need some kinda medicine to heal\nPancham.
A4_40070_HARRY_300_2000	Hmm... There’s an herbal remedy shop here in\nBamboo Borough.
A4_40070_HARRY_300_3000	I might be able to get what I need at the herbal\nremedy shop.
A4_40070_HARRY_400_1000	Nah. For now, gathering info’s my top priority.
A4_40080_HARRY_100_1000	I’m feeling kinda stuck.
A4_40080_HARRY_100_2000	Maybe I oughta put my thoughts in order?
A4_40080_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_40080_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_40080_HARRY_300_1000	Apparently the guy who runs the herbal remedy shop\nalways sends his son to find the medicine ingredients.
A4_40080_HARRY_300_2000	So if I can find the shop owner’s son, I’ll be able to\nget my hands on some herbal medicine.
A4_40080_HARRY_300_3000	He probably can’t get into the bamboo forest\nright now, so he’s gotta be somewhere in the\nneighborhood.
A4_40080_HARRY_300_4000	Better go look for him.
A4_40080_HARRY_400_1000	Nah. For now, gathering info’s my top priority.
A4_40090_HARRY_100_1000	I’m feeling kinda stuck.
A4_40090_HARRY_100_2000	Maybe I oughta put my thoughts in order?
A4_40090_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_40090_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_40090_HARRY_300_1000	The kid told me to bring him an Oval Stone.
A4_40090_HARRY_300_2000	And he said Happiny have Oval Stones.
A4_40090_HARRY_300_2500	He also said I should be able to find a Happiny if I\nkeep an eye out for any shaking bushes.
A4_40090_HARRY_300_3000	Guess I’d better find me some bushes, then.
A4_40090_HARRY_400_1000	Nah. For now, gathering info’s my top priority.
A4_40100_HARRY_100_1000	I’m feeling kinda stuck.
A4_40100_HARRY_100_2000	Maybe I oughta put my thoughts in order?
A4_40100_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_40100_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_40100_HARRY_300_1000	According to the kid, the Bunnelby with Energy Roots\nlive in burrows.
A4_40100_HARRY_300_2000	I oughta go into the forest and find a hole that looks\nlike it could be a Bunnelby burrow.
A4_40100_HARRY_400_1000	Nah. For now, gathering info’s my top priority.
A4_40110_HARRY_100_1000	I’m feeling kinda stuck.
A4_40110_HARRY_100_2000	Maybe I oughta put my thoughts in order?
A4_40110_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_40110_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_40110_HARRY_300_1000	What’s a guy gotta do to reach a berserk Pokémon?
A4_40110_HARRY_300_2000	I oughta investigate near the cliff where Hoothoot\ncame flying from.
A4_40110_HARRY_300_3000	Maybe I’ll find a way to head farther in that direction.
A4_40110_HARRY_400_1000	Nah. For now, gathering info’s my top priority.
A4_40120_HARRY_100_1000	I’m feeling kinda stuck.
A4_40120_HARRY_100_2000	Maybe I oughta put my thoughts in order?
A4_40120_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_40120_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_40120_HARRY_300_1000	What caused Lairon to go berserk?
A4_40120_HARRY_300_2000	One thing’s for sure—the way its eyes turned red was\nNOT normal.
A4_40120_HARRY_300_3000	Red eyes must be a symptom of the underlying\ncause...
A4_40120_HARRY_400_1000	Nah. For now, gathering info’s my top priority.
A4_40130_TIM_100_1000	It feels like there was a contradiction in Pikachu’s\nstory just now.
A4_40130_TIM_100_2000	Should I take a moment to think about it?
A4_40130_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A4_40130_SEL_0_2000	No
A4_40140_TIM_100_1000	It feels like there was a contradiction in Pikachu’s\nstory just now.

A4_Detective.asset
A4_Q0110_TIM_100_10	Something about Pikachu’s story doesn’t add up.
A4_Q0110_TIM_100_20	I wonder if he’s mixing up his dreams with reality...\nHe’d probably get mad if I suggested that though.
A4_Q0110_TIM_100_30	I’ve gotta clarify some things with him after he\nsettles down.
A4_Q0110_TIM_100_40	For now, I’ll go over what Pikachu said and try to\nfigure out which part of his story doesn’t add up.
A4_Q0110_TIM_200_10	Let me think this through again and see if there was\nsomething obviously strange about his story.
A4_Q0110_TIM_300_10	Pikachu’s story seems to contradict itself.
A4_Q0110_TIM_300_20	Let me think this through and figure out which part of\nhis story doesn’t add up.
A4_Q0110_TIM_400_10	If I remember correctly, Pikachu said he met Dad in\nthe bamboo forest.
A4_Q0110_TIM_400_20	Since Pikachu entered the bamboo forest by crossing\na river, Dad had to have been the one who used the\nkey to open the gate.
A4_Q0110_TIM_400_30	Maybe he heard that story from Dad, got the details\nmixed up, and thinks he’s the one who got the key.
A4_Q0110_TIM_500_10	Hmm... On second thought, I don’t think that’s a\ncontradiction.
A4_Q0110_TIM_500_20	What was the order of Pikachu and Dad’s actions\nagain?
A4_Q0110_TIM_500_30	I should think through that part again.
A4_Q0110_TIM_600_10	Hmm... On second thought, I don’t think that’s a\ncontradiction.
A4_Q0110_TIM_600_20	What was the order of Pikachu and Dad’s actions\nagain?
A4_Q0110_TIM_600_30	I should think through that part again.
A4_Q0210_TIM_100_10	Something about Pikachu’s story seems off again...
A4_Q0210_TIM_100_20	I’ll organize everything he said and figure out which\npart of his story sounded strange.
A4_Q0210_TIM_300_10	I’ll sort through and think over what Pikachu said he\ndid when he helped Pancham.
A4_Q0210_TIM_400_10	Pikachu said he stayed by Pancham’s side the whole\ntime and protected him.
A4_Q0210_TIM_400_20	If that were the case, he wouldn’t have been able to\nlook for medicine at the same time.
A4_Q0210_TIM_400_30	These two parts of Pikachu’s story clearly contradict\neach other.
A4_Q0210_TIM_400_40	I had a feeling something was off about his memory.\nI should have him rest back in town.
A4_Q0210_TIM_500_10	On second thought, I don’t think there’s anything\nstrange about that.
A4_Q0210_TIM_500_20	I’m sure there’s a contradiction in this story\nsomewhere.
A4_Q0210_TIM_500_30	Let me think again about what Pikachu said he and\nDad did.
A4_Q0210_TIM_600_10	Pikachu tried to scare Dad off... Hmm, I don’t think\nthere’s anything strange about that.
A4_Q0210_TIM_600_20	That happened when Pikachu and Dad first met.
A4_Q0210_TIM_600_30	They weren’t partners yet, so I don’t think it’s strange\nthat Pikachu was suspicious of Dad and tried to scare\nhim off.
A4_Q0310_TIM_100_10	I’m trying to make sense of Pikachu’s story, but\nsomething else about it seems strange to me.
A4_Q0310_TIM_100_20	I know not everything makes sense in a dream, but\nparts of what he’s told me actually did make sense.
A4_Q0310_TIM_100_30	I just have this hunch that I also need to sort out what\nhe said in this story.
A4_Q0310_TIM_300_10	I know! There’s something strange about what\nPikachu said he did.
A4_Q0310_TIM_400_10	If what Pikachu said is true, it would mean he climbed\nthat huge boulder twice.
A4_Q0310_TIM_400_20	I doubt that he climbed down the boulder just to\nclimb it a second time...
A4_Q0310_TIM_400_30	He also said he followed my dad. What does this\nall mean?
A4_Q0310_TIM_500_10	Hmm... That did seem strange at first, but I don’t\nthink that’s it.
A4_Q0310_TIM_500_20	Let me think over his story again. I’m sure there’s\nsomething that was more obviously strange.
A4_Q0310_TIM_600_10	Hmm... That did seem strange at first, but I don’t\nthink that’s it.
A4_Q0310_TIM_600_20	Let me think over his story again. I’m sure there’s\nsomething that was more obviously strange.
A4_Q0410_TIM_100_10	Pikachu said he tried to reason with two suspicious-\nlooking men...
A4_Q0410_TIM_100_20	but Dad was there, too, wasn’t he? So how come\nPikachu was the one who tried to reason with them?
A4_Q0410_TIM_100_30	Something else about this story is strange too. I’ll\nclarify some things with Pikachu after I go over what\nhe just said.
A4_Q0410_TIM_300_10	Another part of Pikachu’s story just now was strange.
A4_Q0410_TIM_300_20	Let me think this through carefully and figure out\nwhat seems strange.
A4_Q0410_TIM_400_10	Of course! I’m the only one who can understand what\nPikachu says.
A4_Q0410_TIM_400_20	So how was he able to talk to those suspicious men?
A4_Q0410_TIM_400_30	Maybe he got confused when he heard Dad talking\nto those guys, and now he thinks he’s the one who\ntalked to them.
A4_Q0410_TIM_500_10	Hmm... That did seem strange at first, but I don’t\nthink that’s it.
A4_Q0410_TIM_500_20	Let me think over his story again. I’m sure there’s\nsomething that was more obviously strange.
A4_Q0410_TIM_600_10	Hmm... That did seem strange at first, but I don’t\nthink that’s it.
A4_Q0410_TIM_600_20	Let me think over his story again. I’m sure there’s\nsomething that was more obviously strange.
A4_Q0510_HARRY_100_10	I’ve gotta borrow the key to the gate in order to get\ninto the bamboo forest.
A4_Q0510_HARRY_100_20	Problem is, the master of the charcoal shop’s got that\nkey—and he’s a real stubborn piece of work.
A4_Q0510_HARRY_100_30	He’s not just gonna give it to me if I tell him I need it\nfor my investigation.
A4_Q0510_HARRY_100_40	No, I need a reason to enter the bamboo forest that’ll\nactually convince him to give me that key.
A4_Q0510_HARRY_100_50	I just need info—any kind, really. Something to point\nme in the right direction.
A4_Q0510_HARRY_100_60	Maybe the people around here know something.
A4_Q0510_HARRY_200_10	Can’t seem to find a good solution with the info I\nhave now. I’ll keep talking to the people in town and\nsee if I can come up with anything.
A4_Q0510_HARRY_300_10	Lemme think this through... Based on all the info I’ve\ngathered, how can I convince the master of the\ncharcoal shop to lend me the key?
A4_Q0510_HARRY_400_10	Whenever the elevator’s on the fritz, the ol’ charcoal\nshop master will bend over backward to fix it, which\ncan’t be good for that injured back of his.
A4_Q0510_HARRY_400_15	That’s what the souvenir shop owner said, more\nor less.
A4_Q0510_HARRY_400_20	Which goes to show that that elevator is extremely\nimportant to him.
A4_Q0510_HARRY_400_30	Maybe if I tell the master of the charcoal shop that\nI’ll fix the elevator, he’ll agree to lend me the key.
A4_Q0510_HARRY_400_40	OK! I’ll go negotiate with him!
A4_Q0510_HARRY_500_10	Small Pokémon sumo wrestling sounds like a pretty\nrare spectacle! I’d love to go see it for myself...
A4_Q0510_HARRY_500_20	but I don’t think that’s gonna convince the charcoal\nshop master to lend me the key.
A4_Q0510_HARRY_600_10	It’s possible that the berserk Pokémon wrecked the\ncharcoal kiln...
A4_Q0510_HARRY_600_20	Telling the charcoal shop master I’m a detective didn’t\nhelp—I doubt telling him I want to investigate the kiln\nwould convince him to lend me the key, either.
A4_Q0510_HARRY_800_10	I don’t have a clear solution yet with the information\nI’ve gathered so far. I’ll keep talking to people.
A4_Q0610_HARRY_100_10	I’ll conduct a thorough investigation of the scene so I\ncan figure out what exactly happened here.
A4_Q0610_HARRY_200_10	I can’t draw any conclusions from the information I\nhave now. I guess I’ll investigate a little more.
A4_Q0610_HARRY_300_10	OK, I’ll start going over the information I’ve gathered\nand try to deduce what happened here.
A4_Q0610_HARRY_400_10	First, the different-sized sets of footprints tell me that\nthere was a big Pokémon and a small Pokémon.
A4_Q0610_HARRY_400_20	Judging by how these footprints were formed, the two\ndefinitely encountered each other here.
A4_Q0610_HARRY_400_30	Next, the scorches on the ground. Those were likely\ncaused by a Pokémon using an Electric-type move.
A4_Q0610_HARRY_400_40	Based on the evidence, some Pokémon definitely got\ninto a scrap with each other.
A4_Q0610_HARRY_400_50	With all that said, if I follow both sets of footprints,\nI should be able to find the berserk Pokémon.
A4_Q0610_HARRY_500_10	Maybe these scorches on the ground were caused by\nsomeone who fell and spilled some bamboo charcoal\nthey were carrying.
A4_Q0610_HARRY_500_20	When they lost their balance, they hit the bamboo\nfence with the container they kept the charcoal in,\nspilling charcoal on the ground.
A4_Q0610_HARRY_500_30	But even if that did happen, it wouldn’t cause a mess\nquite like this. I’ll think this over again.
A4_Q0610_HARRY_600_10	Maybe a lightning strike made these scorches and\nbroke the bamboo plants. That’d also explain these\nfootprints—startled Pokémon could’ve made them.
A4_Q0610_HARRY_600_20	Though...even if lightning DID just happen to strike\nhere, that wouldn’t explain the other bits of evidence\nleft behind.
A4_Q0610_HARRY_800_10	Seems like I might’ve missed some things. I’ll check\nthe scene again.
A4_Q0710_HARRY_100_10	What can I use to treat Pancham’s injury? I might find\nsomething if I search around town.
A4_Q0710_HARRY_100_20	I just need to keep looking until I find something.\nHang in there, Pancham! Help is on the way!
A4_Q0710_HARRY_200_10	I’ve gotta search the town and ask around to see if\nthere’s anything that could heal Pancham.
A4_Q0710_HARRY_300_10	All right! I’ve found some things that might help!
A4_Q0710_HARRY_300_20	I just gotta evaluate which of ’em will work best\nfor Pancham.
A4_Q0710_HARRY_300_30	I mean, I could also just choose something at random\nand see what happens...
A4_Q0710_HARRY_300_40	but Pancham’s in pretty rough shape—I probably\nshouldn’t overwhelm it with stuff that might not work.
A4_Q0710_HARRY_300_50	I’ll choose something I know will make it feel better.
A4_Q0710_HARRY_400_10	Pancham’s low on energy AND paralyzed.
A4_Q0710_HARRY_400_20	The obvious answer for treating those two things is an\nEnergy Root and Heal Powder!
A4_Q0710_HARRY_400_30	I’ll bring ’em to Pancham right away.
A4_Q0710_HARRY_500_10	If Pancham stuffs itself with pizza, that’ll probably\nmake it feel better. I’m sure it’ll be tasty too!
A4_Q0710_HARRY_500_20	But that wouldn’t cure its paralysis... I’ll think of\nsomething else.
A4_Q0710_HARRY_600_10	Icing its injury isn’t a terrible idea, but I’m not sure\nhow effective that would be...
A4_Q0710_HARRY_600_20	I don’t think ice is the best solution. I’ll think of\nsomething else.
A4_Q0710_HARRY_800_10	Maybe there’s another way. I should keep looking.
A4_Q0810_HARRY_100_10	That Hoothoot looked pretty panicked. I bet it saw\nsomething terrifying.
A4_Q0810_HARRY_100_20	It probably saw the same thing I’m looking for...
A4_Q0810_HARRY_100_30	the berserk Pokémon.
A4_Q0810_HARRY_100_40	The berserk Pokémon must be near where that\nHoothoot was.
A4_Q0810_HARRY_100_50	I’ll investigate this area and figure out how I can\nget there.
A4_Q0810_HARRY_200_10	I still need more information. I’ll keep searching\nfor clues.
A4_Q0810_HARRY_300_10	OK, time to figure this thing out!
A4_Q0810_HARRY_400_10	The boulder crushed the path leading up the hill...but\nthe path should still continue at the top of the hill.
A4_Q0810_HARRY_400_20	If I climb up the boulder, I should be able to get to\nthat path and make my way to the berserk Pokémon.
A4_Q0810_HARRY_500_10	Maybe I could move the broken bamboo stalks and\nmake my way through the path... Nah, it’s probably\ntoo much bamboo for me to move on my own.
A4_Q0810_HARRY_500_20	And I can’t ask the folks back in town for help either.\nI’ll give up on this idea.
A4_Q0810_HARRY_600_10	Should I try jumping into Bunnelby’s burrow?
A4_Q0810_HARRY_600_20	It might lead to where the Hoothoot flew in from...\nEh, there’s no way that would work.
A4_Q0810_HARRY_800_10	I don’t think I’ve collected enough information. I\nshould take another look around and see if I can\nturn up anything useful.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_100_10	So it turns out humans are involved in the berserk\nPokémon incidents in Bamboo Borough.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_100_20	Those two suspicious-looking guys I saw in the forest\nlooked like they were trying to avoid being seen by\nother people.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_100_30	And that Lairon was probably a Pokémon they\nbrought along with them.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_100_40	The question is, why did Lairon go berserk?
A4_Q0910_HARRY_100_50	I’ll try to deduce whether there was anything strange\nabout Lairon’s behavior when it went berserk.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_300_10	Why did Lairon go berserk all of a sudden?
A4_Q0910_HARRY_400_10	Something definitely seemed off about Lairon’s red\neyes—not to mention the way it went berserk.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_400_20	I feel like it wasn’t even thinking straight. Almost like\nit just...lost its mind all of a sudden.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_400_30	Why did it react so violently? I need to get to the\nbottom of this.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_400_40	Let’s assume for the sake of argument that Lairon was\nforced to go berserk.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_400_50	Considering all the destruction in the bamboo forest\nand Lairon’s violent, out-of-control behavior...
A4_Q0910_HARRY_400_60	It’d all make sense if those two guys forced Lairon to\ngo berserk—though how they did that, I’m not sure...
A4_Q0910_HARRY_400_70	There might be more evidence back there. Once I’m\ndone investigating here, I’ll go take another look\naround the bamboo forest.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_500_10	Maybe those two guys ordered Lairon to go berserk.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_500_20	Nah... Considering the way Lairon was behaving, it’s\nunlikely it was taking orders from ANYONE.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_500_30	I don’t think it was even aware of what it was doing...\nI can’t imagine it was following orders at the time.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_600_10	Maybe Lairon went berserk because some humans\nstartled it.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_600_20	No, wait... Lairon wasn’t startled by those two guys\nwho were there before we showed up.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_600_30	It also went berserk in areas of the bamboo forest\nwhere humans weren’t present—and it attacked\nPancham too.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_600_40	So this probably wasn’t caused by humans startling it.
A4_Q0910_HARRY_800_10	I might have overlooked something... I’ll think back to\nthis again.
A4_Drama.asset
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_100_10	Huh? Why’s this “Berserk Pokémon” sign here?
A4_Drama_TIM_100_10	R could be why.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_100_20	We dealt with that years ago.\nNo need for this now!
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_100_30	I’ll get rid of it.

A4_Drama_HARRY_200_30	Oh! Sorry, I can explain!\nHere, it’s on the card.
A4_Drama_PIZZASTORE_200_20	Oh, well, thanks.
A4_Drama_PIZZASTORE_200_30	Harry Goodman... You’re a detective?
A4_Drama_HARRY_200_40	Hrm? I’m not just a detective—
A4_Drama_PIZZASTORE_200_40_NOMESSAGE	Huh?
A4_Drama_HARRY_200_50	I’m a great detective!
A4_Drama_HARRY_200_60	Detective...Harry!
A4_Drama_HARRY_300_10	Hm? Is that...?

A4_Drama_PIKACHUO_400_30_NOMESSAGE	Pika...
A4_Drama_HARRY_400_20	There, there. \nSit tight for a second.
A4_Drama_HARRY_400_30	You’ll feel better after you eat this.

A4_Drama_HARRY_400_40	Ha ha ha! Tastes bad, huh?\nThat’s how you know it’s working.
A4_Drama_HARRY_500_10	Hm?
A4_Drama_PIKACHUO_500_10_NOMESSAGE	Pika, pika pika!\n\[They’re the cause of all this?\]
A4_Drama_HARRY_500_20	W-wait, hold on!

A4_Drama_HARRY_500_40	Excuse me. What are you doing here?
A4_Drama_KEITH_500_20	Who, us? Just gathering bamboo shoots.
A4_Drama_HARRY_500_50	It sure doesn’t look that way.
A4_Drama_KEITH_500_30_NOMESSAGE	Tch!
A4_Drama_KEITH_500_40	R oughta shut him up!

A4_Drama_TIM_1100_10	Pikachu.
A4_Drama_TIM_1100_20	You say you got the hat from my dad,\nbut you also “gave it to Pikachu”?
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1100_10	That’s right... How strange.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1100_20	I’m starting to remember more.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1100_30	This whole thing started...with that car accident.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1100_40	I remember...
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1100_50	Driving my car that day, with my partner Pikachu.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1100_60	Suddenly, the brakes failed and we crashed...in a valley.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1100_70	And then I...I got thrown out of the car.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1100_80	Everything started to fade. And I blacked out...
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1100_90	All I remember...is Pikachu desperately crying for help.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1100_100	But... Of course... These memories\nup to that point were Harry’s!
A4_Drama_PIKACHUO_1100_10_NOMESSAGE	Pika pika!\n\[Help!\]
A4_Drama_PIKACHUO_1100_20_NOMESSAGE	Piiikaaa! Pika pika pika pika!\n\[Help!\]
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1100_10	What is the matter?\nYou do not appear to be injured.
A4_Drama_PIKACHUO_1100_30_NOMESSAGE	Pika pika pikachu!\n\[Save this person!\]
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1100_20	It is too late for him.\nHe is fading as we speak.
A4_Drama_PIKACHUO_1100_40_NOMESSAGE	Pika! Pika pika!\n\[I’ll do anything for him! Save him!\]
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1100_30	You would go that far?
A4_Drama_PIKACHUO_1100_50_NOMESSAGE	Pika! Pika pika!\n\[He’s my partner!\]
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1100_40	I will need your physical form to save him.
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1100_50	Even I cannot say for certain what will happen.\nKnowing this, do you still wish to save him?
A4_Drama_PIKACHUO_1100_60_NOMESSAGE	Pikachu! Pika!\n\[I don’t care what happens to me!\]
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1100_80	Very well.
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1100_90	However...I have one condition.
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1100_100	My cells are being used by some\nhumans for nefarious ends.
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1100_110	I want you to retrieve them for me.
A4_Drama_PIKACHUO_1100_70_NOMESSAGE	Pikachu! Pika pika!\n\[OK, I’ll do it! Just hurry and save him!\]
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1100_120	The fate of this human rests in the\nstrength of your bond with him.
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1100_130	Now...
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1200_10	Anyway...
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1200_20	That’s what went down\nbetween me and Mewtwo.
A4_Drama_TIM_1200_10	It sounds to me like Dad and Pikachu\nhad a really strong bond.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1200_30	Yeah.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1200_40	By the way, Tim, don’t you wanna know what me\nand Mewtwo talked about after the R incident?
A4_Drama_TIM_1200_20	Huh? You remember what\nhappened then, too?
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1200_50	Yeah! I remember it like it was\nyesterday—crystal clear!
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_10	After we solved the R case...
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_20	I went out to that alley to\nmeet up with Mewtwo.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_30	Here you are. Just like I promised you.
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1300_10	Indeed. Thank you.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_40	So...that means it’s my turn now!
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1300_20	Before we proceed, there is\nsomething we must discuss.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_50	Oh yeah? Don’t tell me\nyou can’t do it now!
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1300_30	... ... ...
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1300_40	Right now, Pikachu’s consciousness and your\nhuman consciousness coexist within you.
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1300_50	It is a miracle that this balance \nhas endured as long as it has.
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1300_60	I can only imagine that your trust in\none another has made this possible.
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1300_70	If I were to forcibly separate the two...
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_60	You’re saying...you can’t guarantee that I’d survive that?
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1300_80	Correct. I would say you have a\n50 percent chance of survival.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_70	... ... ...
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1300_90	... ... ...
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1300_100	We don’t have much time.\nHave you decided on which one to choose?
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_90	Yeah, I’ve made up my mind.\nI’ll take my chances with that 50 percent!
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1300_110	So be it...
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_100	Hey! Wait a second!
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_110	When you say I might not survive, do\nyou mean just me? Or Pikachu, too?
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1300_120	Your fate and Pikachu’s are\ninextricably intertwined...
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_120	Then I can’t afford to leave this up to chance.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_130	Sorry...can you wait before making me human again?
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_140	Please. I’m sure Tim will figure something out.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_150	Besides, I’d like to be here\nand watch him grow up.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_160	I’m sorry, Tim...\nCan’t come home just yet.
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1300_140	Very well.
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1300_150	However, because you used a move earlier,\nyou are now in a precarious situation.
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1300_160	If your human consciousness remains \nthis strong, Pikachu’s will disappear.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_170	Then...what can I do?
A4_Drama_MEWTWO_1300_170	I will restore the balance between your consciousnesses,\nand you will forget what you now remember.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_180	Amnesia again?
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_190	Hey, wait!
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_200	If you do that, how am I\nsupposed to tell Tim I’m—
A4_Drama_TIM_1400_10	All this time I’ve been looking for my dad...and\nall along, you’ve been right beside me.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_10	I’m sorry. I should’ve realized it sooner.
A4_Drama_TIM_1400_20	You think that’s why we could understand each other?
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_30	Yeah, that really should have\nbeen our biggest clue, huh?
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_40	After all...you’re my own flesh and blood!
A4_Drama_TIM_1400_25_NOMESSAGE	(slight intake a breath)
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_50	You’ve really grown up, Tim.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_60	You finally found me. Thank you!
A4_Drama_TIM_1400_30	So...what do I call you now?
A4_Drama_TIM_1400_40	Should I call you...“Dad”?
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_70_NOMESSAGE	Huh?
A4_Drama_TIM_1400_50	I mean, you’re my dad.\nBut you’re a Pikachu, too...
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_80	Heh, yeah. It’d be weird if\nsomeone overheard you.
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_90	“Pikachu” is fine for now.
A4_Drama_TIM_1400_60	Huh?
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_110	Just until I’m back to normal.
A4_Drama_TIM_1400_80	Yeah. Sounds good, Da—\nI mean, Pikachu!
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_115	Hahahaha!
A4_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_120	I’d better get back to normal\nsoon—for everyone’s sake!

A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_200_10	Hey, you smell kind of, I dunno...familiar.
A4_PikaTalk_GORONDA_200_10	(Really? Uh... Maybe I do?)
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_200_20	I swear I’ve smelled this scent before.\nBut why would that be...?
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_300_10	Did you grow up in Bamboo Borough?
A4_PikaTalk_GORONDA_300_10	(Yeah, that’s right.)
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_300_20	It’s really nice here.
A4_PikaTalk_GORONDA_300_20	(Thanks. Glad you think so too.)
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_300_30	It’s hard to believe a ruffian like you\ncould come from somewhere so tranquil!
A4_PikaTalk_GORONDA_300_30	(Watch your mouth.\nLet’s just get moving, all right?)
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_400_10	You know, I’ve been thinking...
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_400_20	I’m lucky to have pals like you and Luxray.
A4_PikaTalk_GORONDA_400_10	(We’re happy to help.)
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_500_10	You’re a real powerhouse, Pangoro. Have\nyou been this strong since you were little?
A4_PikaTalk_GORONDA_500_10	(Huh? Uhhh...yeah. Absolutely.)
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_500_20	Well, THAT sure wasn’t convincing.
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_500_30	Don’t forget you’re dealing with a great\ndetective! You’re hiding something,\naren’t you?
A4_PikaTalk_GORONDA_500_20	(Shut up! Just drop it!)
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_500_40	Whoa!
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_600_10	Hey, Tim. I don’t know if it’s the\nambiance or the smell of bamboo...
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_600_20	But just being here is making me\nfeel really calm and relaxed.
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_600_30	I wonder why...
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_700_10	Heeey, Tim! Over here!\nThere’s a lot of cool stuff here!
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_700_20	Oh! The snacks in Bamboo\nBorough are really famous!
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_700_30	Huh? We’re not getting any? Why not?!
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_800_10	Nothing beats a cup of coffee after a\nslice of pizza, wouldn’t you say, Tim?
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_800_20	It’s just the best!
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_900_10	I haven’t seen any cafés around here\nyet, but there’s gotta be somewhere to\nget bamboo charcoal coffee!
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_900_20	That’s what I’m guessing, at least.
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1000_10	Hey! Mind if I join ya?
A4_PikaTalk_KIREIHANA01_1000_10	(Who are you?)
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1000_20	Whaddya think? I’m a natural, huh?

A4_PikaTalk_KODUCK_1200_10	(Ngh...)
A4_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1200_20	There’s something I wanted\nto ask you, actually...

A4_SRT_IRENE_6700_10	She had her heart set on making coffee\nfor Pikachu and was practicing it all day.
A4_SRT_TIM_6700_20	You were pretty worried about him, huh?

A4_SRT_HARRY_1500_50	Must be this way...
A4_SRT_HARRY_7000_10	All right, then...\nJust a little climb, no problem.
A4_SRT_HARRY_7000_20	Phew...
A4_SRT_HARRY_7000_30	Just a bit more to go.
A4_SRT_HARRY_1600_10	Who are they?
A4_SRT_HARRY_1600_20	And what are they up to?
A4_SRT_TIM_1700_10	Pikachu! Pikachu, wake up!
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_1700_20	Uuugh...
A4_SRT_TIM_1900_10	Jessica, do you remember\nwhen this photo was taken?
A4_SRT_JESSICA_1900_10	Oh, yes. This brings back memories...
A4_SRT_JESSICA_1900_20	We took that photo together to\ncelebrate the beginning of our project.
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_2000_20	This place... I’m sure of it...
A4_SRT_TIM_2000_30	Hey! Where are you going!
A4_SRT_RACHEL_2000_20	Is everything all right, Tim?
A4_SRT_TIM_2000_40	You two go on ahead!
A4_SRT_TIM_2000_50	We’ll catch up with you!
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_2100_10	Yep... No mistaking it!
A4_SRT_TIM_2100_20	What’s going on, Pikachu?
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_2100_20	I knew this was the place!
A4_SRT_GORONDA_2200_30_NOMESSAGE	PKMN cry\n(Hmm...?)
A4_SRT_TIM_2200_50	Pikachu!
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_2200_30	Say, aren’t you...?
A4_SRT_GORONDA_2200_50_NOMESSAGE	Gorrrooo! (Well, if it isn’t Pikachu!)
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_2200_40	I knew I recognized you!
A4_SRT_RACHEL_2300_10	Ahhhhh!
A4_SRT_TIM_2300_10_NOMESSAGE	(small gasp)
A4_SRT_TIM_2300_20	That was...Rachel!
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_2300_10	It sounds like she’s in trouble. Let’s go!
A4_SRT_TIM_2300_30	Yeah!
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_7100_10	Hey, Tim! Look! Footprints!

A4_SRT_TIM_7100_20	They went across this bridge.
A4_SRT_HARRY_7200_10_NOMESSAGE	Uuugh...
A4_SRT_PIKACHUO_7200_10_NOMESSAGE	Pika? (Are you OK?)
A4_SRT_HARRY_7200_20	Thank goodness. I’m glad you’re OK!

A4_SRT_HARRY_3800_20	I couldn’t have done it without\nyou. Thanks, Pikachu.
A4_SRT_PIKACHUO_3800_10_NOMESSAGE	Pika pikka!

A4_SRT_HARRY_3800_30_NOMESSAGE	Heh heh.
A4_SRT_HARRY_7400_10	This must be the charcoal kiln hut...
A4_SRT_TIM_3900_10	Pikachu! Wake up, Pikachu!
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_3900_20	Mrmmgh... Huh?
A4_SRT_TIM_4100_10	Come on, come on!
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_4100_10	Stressing out won’t make\nthis go any faster, Tim.
A4_SRT_TIM_4100_20	R-right...
A4_SRT_BAENEMYDARK01_4300_10	Looks like I got what I was after...
A4_SRT_BAENEMYDARK01_4300_20	Now I just need to capture\nthat detective duo.
A4_SRT_JESSICA_4300_10	I’ve already given you the research data.\nJust leave us alone!
A4_SRT_BAENEMYDARK01_4300_30	What did you say...?
A4_SRT_BAENEMYDARK01_4300_40	You’ve got a lot of nerve making\ndemands of Unitas!
A4_SRT_JESSICA_4300_20	Unitas?!
A4_SRT_TIM_4400_10	Are you OK?
A4_SRT_RACHEL_4400_10	Yeah...
A4_SRT_JESSICA_4400_10	I’m fine too.
A4_SRT_JESSICA_4400_20	But...they stole something\nreally important.
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_7500_10	What do you think, Tim? Jessica sure\ngave us a lot to consider, huh?
A4_SRT_TIM_7500_10	No kidding.
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_7500_20	So, she was attacked by people who\nwere after Emma’s research data...
A4_SRT_TIM_7500_20	And they called themselves Unitas—\nthe same name as Emma’s project.
A4_SRT_TIM_7500_30	Which means, if we head to the lab—
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_7500_30	My thoughts exactly.
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_7500_40	This mystery’s been twisty,\nbut I think we’re startin’ to get it.
A4_SRT_TIM_7500_40	You’re right. I suspect that—
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_7500_50	Wait, Tim! Just a second.
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_7500_60	I’d like to back up our theory a bit more\nbefore we go and get too excited.
A4_SRT_TIM_7500_50	How?
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_7500_70	We’ll start tomorrow morning,\nby organizing all the information\nwe’ve collected up to now.
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_7500_80	This view of the bamboo forest is\nreminding me of Harry all over again.
A4_SRT_TIM_7500_60	Did you and my dad come out this way too?
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_7500_90	Sure did. This is where me and Harry\nfaced down a rampaging Lairon together!
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_7500_100	*sigh* Good times...
A4_SRT_TIM_7500_70	That’s wild to think about...\nYou and my dad were right here, huh?
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_7500_110	Yeah—and it wasn’t a cakewalk,\nlet me tell you.
A4_SRT_TIM_4500_10	Pikachu, can I have a word with you?
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_4500_10	Huh? “Have a word?”\nWhat’s this about, Tim?
A4_SRT_TIM_4500_20	If you don’t mind, I’d like\nto talk to you in private.
A4_SRT_PIKACHU_4500_20	In that case, let’s chat in there.

A4_V4.asset
A4_V4_PIKACHU_100_10	So what’s so important that\nwe need to talk alone?
A4_V4_PIKACHU_100_20	Do you need relationship advice?
A4_V4_TIM_100_10	Yeah, you wish.
A4_V4_TIM_100_20	Ever since we got to this area, you’ve\nbeen acting really strange.
A4_V4_PIKACHU_100_30	You think so? Guess all those memories\nrushing back jumbled my brain.
A4_V4_TIM_100_30	Well, let’s start unjumbling it, then.
A4_V4_PIKACHU_100_40	Sounds good to me.\nWhere should we start?
A4_V4_TIM_200_10	OK, let’s go in chronological order.
A4_V4_TIM_200_20	When my dad came here, do you\nremember the first thing he did?
A4_V4_PIKACHU_200_10	Well, Harry came here to investigate\nthe Berserk Pokémon incident.
A4_V4_PIKACHU_200_20	But the gate to the bamboo forest was\nlocked, so I had to borrow the key...
A4_V4_PIKACHU_200_30	After that, we had our fateful encounter.
A4_V4_TIM_200_30	Don’t you find that...a little unusual?
A4_V4_TIM_300_10	You’d never met my dad before\nyou crossed paths in the bamboo\nforest, right?
A4_V4_PIKACHU_300_10	Yep, that’s right.
A4_V4_TIM_300_20	In that case...don’t you think it’s strange?
A4_V4_TIM_300_30	I mean, how could you even know about\nwhat happened before you met my dad?
A4_V4_PIKACHU_300_20	Huh? Now that you mention it, that\nIS strange...
A4_V4_PIKACHU_300_30	Maybe I heard from Harry?
A4_V4_TIM_400_10	(No, wait a second... That’s not it.)
A4_V4_TIM_400_20	(Pikachu and my dad first\nmet in the bamboo forest.)
A4_V4_TIM_400_30	(And that means...)
A4_V4_TIM_500_10	After that...you helped Pancham in the\nbamboo forest?
A4_V4_PIKACHU_500_10	Yeah.
A4_V4_PIKACHU_500_20	I was by his side the whole time,\nprotecting him until his injury got better.
A4_V4_PIKACHU_500_30	Tracking down the medicine was tough!
A4_V4_TIM_500_20	But...how is that possible?
A4_V4_TIM_600_10	Pikachu, that doesn’t make sense.
A4_V4_TIM_600_20	If you were with Pancham the whole\ntime, you couldn’t have gone looking\nfor medicine.
A4_V4_PIKACHU_600_10	Hm? I could’ve sworn I stayed with him.
A4_V4_PIKACHU_600_20	Maybe I left once to go look around for\nsome medicine? Hmmm...
A4_V4_TIM_800_10	(Hmm... No, that’s not conclusive.)
A4_V4_TIM_800_20	(Pikachu’s contradicting\nhimself somehow, isn’t he?)
A4_V4_TIM_900_10	After Pancham recovered, do you\nremember what happened next?
A4_V4_PIKACHU_900_10	Yeah. I heard a Pokémon roar from\nsomewhere way off in the forest.
A4_V4_PIKACHU_900_20	I saw some Pokémon fleeing,\nso I figured there was something\nbeyond the boulder.
A4_V4_TIM_900_20	And then what?
A4_V4_PIKACHU_900_30	I climbed the boulder and continued on...
A4_V4_PIKACHU_900_40	And then I followed Harry and climbed\nthe boulder too... Hm?
A4_V4_TIM_900_30	Just as I thought! Your memories\nhave gotten all mixed up!
A4_V4_TIM_1000_10	Pikachu!
A4_V4_TIM_1000_20	If what you said is correct, wouldn’t that\nmean you climbed the boulder twice?
A4_V4_PIKACHU_1000_10	That’s what I said, but...
A4_V4_PIKACHU_1000_20	Maybe I got mixed up because\nI saw Harry climb it?
A4_V4_TIM_1100_10	(No, that wouldn’t be\nTHAT much of a stretch.)
A4_V4_TIM_1100_20	(There’s something else that\nsounds unnatural here...)
A4_V4_TIM_1200_10	As you went deeper into the bamboo\nforest, what did you find?
A4_V4_PIKACHU_1200_10	I came across a suspicious duo with a Lairon.
A4_V4_PIKACHU_1200_20	And I remember calling out to them.
A4_V4_PIKACHU_1200_30	I shouted something like, “Excuse me!\nWhat are you doing here?”
A4_V4_PIKACHU_1200_40	They tried to play dumb, and then\nthe Lairon suddenly came charging at us.
A4_V4_TIM_1200_20	Wait a second—that doesn’t make sense!
A4_V4_TIM_1300_10	That suspicious duo... Isn’t it strange\nthat they could understand what you\nwere saying?
A4_V4_PIKACHU_1300_10	Yeah, I guess you have a point...
A4_V4_PIKACHU_1300_20	Maybe Harry said it for me?
A4_V4_PIKACHU_1300_30	Hmmm...
A4_V4_TIM_1400_10	(No, that’s not it.)
A4_V4_TIM_1400_20	(It just doesn’t make any sense.)
A4_V4_TIM_1400_30	(Because I know I’m the only person\nwho can understand Pikachu...)
A4_V4_TIM_1500_10	So the two of you escaped from danger\nand decided to become partners.
A4_V4_TIM_1500_20	That’s when you received the hat, right?
A4_V4_PIKACHU_1500_10	Yeah.
A4_V4_PIKACHU_1500_20	I gave this hat to Pikachu as a gift...
A4_V4_PIKACHU_1500_30	And Harry put it on my head...?
A4_V4_TIM_1700_10	(Wait a second...)
A4_V4_TIM_1700_20	(Pikachu said he got\nthat hat from my dad...)
A4_V4_TIM_1700_30	(Which means...)
A5.asset
A5_0115_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s only one way to find out: we need to go ask\nthe mayor himself.
A5_0115_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s sum up what we know so far, Tim.
A5_0115_TIM_100_1000	Sure.
A5_0115_PIKACHU_100_3000	An organization went after Mewtwo and stole my—er,\nHarry’s body from it.
A5_0115_PIKACHU_100_4000	This same organization has also been putting cubes\non Pokémon that force them to do their dirty work.
A5_0115_TIM_100_2000	Right—and that organization’s name is Unitas.
A5_0115_PIKACHU_100_5000	Which is the same name that Emma—Rachel’s\nmother—used for her final project.
A5_0115_TIM_100_3000	The Unitas Project.
A5_0115_PIKACHU_100_6000	That shared name, along with the people involved,\nmakes it pretty clear the two are related.
A5_0115_PIKACHU_100_7000	As for a lab capable of mass-producing machines as\ncomplicated as the cubes...
A5_0115_PIKACHU_100_8000	Emma’s old facility is the only one around that fits\nthe bill.
A5_0115_TIM_100_4000	Isn’t it shut down, though?
A5_0115_PIKACHU_100_9000	Apparently not.
A5_0115_TIM_100_5000	Huh? What do you mean?
A5_0115_PIKACHU_100_10000	Word is, some people have been going in and out\nof that facility recently.
A5_0115_TIM_100_6000	Where did you hear that?
A5_0115_PIKACHU_100_11000	Tim, Tim, Tim.
A5_0115_PIKACHU_100_12000	Do you realize how long I’ve been living in Ryme City\nas a Pokémon?
A5_0115_PIKACHU_100_13000	Between all the Pokémon we’ve met on our cases, I’ve\ngot eyes and ears just about everywhere.
A5_0115_TIM_100_7000	I see. And now that you have my dad’s\nmemories back...
A5_0115_PIKACHU_100_14000	Yep—I combined that knowledge with the latest info\nI’ve gathered.
A5_0115_PIKACHU_100_15000	So trust me—that lab is operational.
A5_0135_SOPHIA_100_1000	Oh no... Is Pikachu depressed?
A5_0135_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s fine. I didn’t take it personally or anything.\n*sigh*
A5_0140_IRENE_100_1000	Are you going out again?
A5_0140_IRENE_100_2000	Just don’t do anything too risky.
A5_0140_IRENE_100_3000	Harry never stopped investigating, no matter how\ndangerous it got, and he... Just please be careful, Tim!
A5_0140_TIM_100_1000	I will, Mom.
A5_0140_PIKACHU_100_1000	Irene... I didn’t realize just how much you worried\nabout me. I’m sorry.
A5_0140_PIKACHU_100_2000	But we’ve almost solved this. Wait for me, Irene!
A5_0140_IRENE_200_1000	Don’t do anything that would make me worry, OK?
A5_0140_TIM_200_1000	Don’t worry, Mom, I won’t.
A5_0150_TIM_100_1000	It’s today’s newspaper.
A5_0150_TIM_100_2000	I wonder what they’re covering.
A5_0150_PIKACHU_200_1000	Any interesting articles?
A5_0160_TIM_100_1000	It’s a special about Pokémon Friendship Week.
A5_0160_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s been a ton going on, but today’s the last day.
A5_0160_TIM_200_1000	It’s a special about Pokémon Friendship Week.
A5_0170_TIM_100_1000	Time to get going?
A5_0170_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yep, let’s mosey.
A5_0510_TIM_100_1000	Hm? You made the front page, Pikachu.
A5_0510_PIKACHU_100_1000	Heh, yeah. I was taking a break after eating at the\npizzeria in Bamboo Borough.
A5_0510_TIM_100_2000	It sure was nice of them to comp us some pizza as\nthanks for carrying the charcoal.
A5_0510_TIM_100_3000	But...did you really have to eat THAT many slices,\nPikachu?
A5_0510_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hey, cut me some slack!
A5_0510_PIKACHU_100_3000	I was out there moving boulders with Pangoro, and I\nstopped that Golem from rolling right at us too.
A5_0510_PIKACHU_100_4000	That kinda strenuous activity works up the appetite,\ny’know!
A5_0510_PIKACHU_100_5000	Didn’t expect to make headlines for it, though...
A5_0510_TIM_100_4000	Maybe this is a good lesson for you about the\ndangers of overeating...
A5_0510_PIKACHU_100_6000	Puh-lease. Not eating something so delicious is way\nmore dangerous, if you ask me.
A5_0510_TIM_100_5000	Mm-hm. Right. Remind me again who stuffed himself\nso full of pizza that he needed to be carried home?
A5_0510_PIKACHU_100_7000	Well, ya see, that, uh... Sorry ’bout that.
A5_0610_TIM_100_1000	What?! There was a robbery in Bamboo Borough?!
A5_0610_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, at the curry joint.
A5_0610_PIKACHU_100_2000	But it looks like they caught the robber right away.
A5_0610_TIM_100_2000	Oh, and look who stopped the robber—it was that\nGumshoos we met!
A5_0610_PIKACHU_100_3000	Gumshoos really took a liking to those curry buns.
A5_0610_PIKACHU_100_4000	It was probably staking the place out, hoping for\nanother chance to eat some!
A5_0610_PIKACHU_100_5000	I’ll bet my hat that’s how it came across the robber.
A5_0610_TIM_100_3000	It says here that the owner of the curry shop actually\ngave Gumshoos some curry buns as a reward.
A5_0610_PIKACHU_100_6000	Well, there ya go! I guess the stakeout paid off!
A5_0620_TIM_100_1000	Here’s a research article about Bellossom’s dancing.
A5_0620_PIKACHU_100_1000	It says they’re studying weather patterns when\nBellossom dances.
A5_0620_PIKACHU_100_2000	They hypothesize that there’s a connection between\nhow energetically Bellossom dance and how clear the\nweather is.
A5_0620_PIKACHU_100_3000	Based on that, I guess they wanna research it further.
A5_0620_TIM_100_2000	Wasn’t it a clear, sunny day when we met Bellossom?
A5_0620_TIM_100_3000	Do you think their dance moves were somehow\nconnected to how nice the weather was?
A5_0620_PIKACHU_100_4000	I wonder.
A5_0620_PIKACHU_100_5000	But everyone feels more energetic on sunny days\nthan rainy ones, y’know?
A5_0620_PIKACHU_100_6000	Maybe it’s the other way around—when the weather\nis nice, that’s when Bellossom dance up a storm!
A5_0630_PIKACHU_100_1000	Here’s a research article about the relationships\nbetween bug Pokémon in different environments.
A5_0630_TIM_100_1000	It says even bug Pokémon that don’t get along in one\nenvironment might become friends in another.
A5_0630_PIKACHU_100_2000	The Heracross and Vikavolt we ran into at Bamboo\nBorough were a perfect example of that!
A5_0630_PIKACHU_100_3000	Heracross and Pinsir are both bug Pokémon, but\nusually they do NOT get along.
A5_0630_PIKACHU_100_4000	But throw Vikavolt into the ecosystem, and voilà!\nPinsir and Heracross start teaming up!
A5_0630_PIKACHU_100_5000	That tense standoff between Heracross and Vikavolt\nsure had me sweating...
A5_0630_PIKACHU_100_6000	Can you imagine if a Pinsir had been there too?\nThings could’ve escalated into a real beauty of a\nbug battle!
A5_0630_TIM_100_2000	I’m just glad Sylveon was able to calm them down...
A5_0640_PIKACHU_100_1000	Do you remember seeing any Meowth figurines in\nBamboo Borough being sold as souvenirs?
A5_0640_TIM_100_1000	Meowth figurines... Maybe at the ceramics shop?
A5_0640_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, that’s a reasonable guess.
A5_0640_PIKACHU_100_3000	Anyway, looks like they’ve rolled out a new Meowth\nfigurine—a SLEEPING one!
A5_0640_PIKACHU_100_4000	Apparently folks are saying these little knickknacks\nare just the cutest thing ever! They’re practically flying\noff the shelves!
A5_0640_TIM_100_2000	Wow. I guess everyone loves Meowth.
A5_0640_PIKACHU_100_5000	Now you’ve got me thinkin’ about that Alolan Meowth\nwe met. Real character, that guy.
A5_0650_TIM_100_1000	It’s a feature on the curry place where Skwovet was\nhelping out.
A5_0650_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s the joint that’s famous for its super-spicy\nTamato Berry curry, right?
A5_0650_TIM_100_2000	Yeah. I remember Professor Gordon saying he really\nlikes Tamato Berries.
A5_0650_TIM_100_3000	Those Berries are incredibly spicy, aren’t they?
A5_0650_PIKACHU_100_2000	They sure are. I tried some of that curry when I was in\nBamboo Borough way back when.
A5_0650_PIKACHU_100_3000	It was so spicy I thought my tongue was gonna melt\noff—but boy, was it delicious!
A5_0650_PIKACHU_100_4000	Couldn’t imagine eating that stuff every day, though.\nSkwovet’s gotta have a cast-iron stomach.
A5_0650_TIM_100_4000	Wait, are those Berries THAT spicy?!
A5_0650_TIM_100_5000	No wonder Skwovet wanted something sweet...
A5_0660_TIM_100_1000	“Yamper Health Regimen”? I wonder how that works.
A5_0660_PIKACHU_100_1000	Maybe Yamper zaps you with electricity to loosen the\nknots in your shoulders or something?
A5_0660_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yamper are real dynamos, so I could see them being\ngood at that sorta thing.
A5_0660_TIM_100_2000	Sure, I guess that might work. But it also sounds like\nit’d be pretty painful.
A5_0660_TIM_100_3000	Besides, that’s not what the Yamper Health Regimen\nis at all.
A5_0660_TIM_100_4000	It actually just says you should take Yamper to a park\nand run around with it.
A5_0660_PIKACHU_100_3000	Run around with THAT little live wire?! I don’t\nthink so!
A5_0660_PIKACHU_100_4000	Listen to me, Tim. That’s no health regimen—that’s\na marathon!
A5_0660_TIM_100_5000	Well, whatever they call it, exercise is still good for\nyou, isn’t it?
A5_0660_TIM_100_6000	It looks like they’re hosting a meetup for beginners\nat Tahnti Park.
A5_0660_TIM_100_7000	Why don’t you join them, Pikachu?
A5_0660_PIKACHU_100_5000	Yeaaah, running around in circles is gonna be a hard\npass from me, Tim. I’m the brains of this operation,\nnot the brawn.
A5_0660_TIM_100_8000	What happened to “Great Detective Tip #12:\nUse those legs while investigating”?
A5_0660_PIKACHU_100_6000	Oh, you did NOT just use my own tips against me!
A5_0670_PIKACHU_100_1000	A contest to see who looks the most like me?
A5_0670_PIKACHU_100_2000	Wow! Whoever came up with that idea deserves a\nraise!
A5_0670_TIM_100_1000	Looks like it was held at Fountain Plaza.
A5_0670_TIM_100_2000	Most of the participants entered their partner\nPokémon into the contest.
A5_0670_TIM_100_3000	But some people actually entered themselves—decked\nout in homemade Detective Pikachu costumes!
A5_0670_PIKACHU_100_3000	Whoa, do I really have THAT many fans? Not sure I’m\nready for that level of popularity...
A5_0670_TIM_100_4000	Oh yeah? Then why are you grinning so hard\nright now?
A5_0670_PIKACHU_100_4000	So who won the contest?
A5_0670_TIM_100_5000	The winner was a last-minute entry—a wild Mimikyu!
A5_0670_TIM_100_6000	Look, Pikachu! It even had a detective hat like yours.
A5_0670_PIKACHU_100_5000	Whaddya know—I’ve even got Pokémon superfans...
A5_0670_PIKACHU_100_6000	Being loved like this... It’s really hitting me right in the\nwarm and fuzzies...
A5_0680_TIM_100_1000	Wow! It says here that Drakloak fly at over 120\nmiles per hour!
A5_0680_TIM_100_2000	The one we met was flying really slowly when it was\nlooking for Dreepy.
A5_0680_TIM_100_3000	I didn’t realize Drakloak could actually fly that fast.
A5_0680_PIKACHU_100_1000	It probably didn’t wanna fly so fast that it flew right\npast Dreepy.
A5_0680_TIM_100_4000	Over 120 miles per hour, huh...
A5_0680_TIM_100_5000	Amanda drives like a maniac, but I think Drakloak\ncould give her a run for her money.
A5_0680_PIKACHU_100_2000	Don’t even JOKE about something that terrifying...
A5_0690_TIM_100_1000	Here’s an article about a book that’s coming out\nthis week.
A5_0690_PIKACHU_100_1000	“The Farfetched Tale”? What’s it about?
A5_0690_TIM_100_2000	It’s a historical fantasy novel about a Sirfetch’d.
A5_0690_TIM_100_3000	“The wandering warrior, Sirfetch’d, embarks on a long\njourney full of chance encounters and fare-thee-wells.
A5_0690_TIM_100_4000	“You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll fall in love. This\nadventure story is one for the ages.”
A5_0690_PIKACHU_100_2000	Wow, sounds like a pretty epic tale.
A5_0690_TIM_100_5000	Do you suppose the Sirfetch’d we met in the bamboo\nforest ever went on a journey like that?
A5_0690_PIKACHU_100_3000	Well, it was no ordinary Pokémon, I can tell ya that!
A5_0690_PIKACHU_100_4000	By now, it’s probably set out on a new adventure\nwith Pawniard.
A5_0700_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wait, there’s a Mythical Pokémon in the forest at\nBamboo Borough?
A5_0700_TIM_100_1000	I didn’t hear anything about that when we were in the\nbamboo forest—did you?
A5_0700_PIKACHU_100_2000	Nope. And considering the timing, you’d think it\nwould’ve come up...
A5_0700_PIKACHU_100_3000	How do they describe this Mythical Pokémon?
A5_0700_TIM_100_2000	It says no one’s actually seen it clearly.
A5_0700_TIM_100_3000	There are just reports of people peeking into the tall\ngrass when they hear a sound and finding nothing but\na hole in the ground.
A5_0700_TIM_100_4000	Someone did see a shadowy shape leap away from\nthem, though.
A5_0700_TIM_100_5000	Hey, Pikachu—what if it was actually a Pokémon\nwe know?
A5_0700_PIKACHU_100_4000	No ifs, ands, or buts about it—that’s gotta be\nDunsparce.
A5_0700_PIKACHU_100_5000	We convinced that researcher guy to keep Dunsparce\na secret...
A5_0700_PIKACHU_100_6000	but it looks like word got out anyway.
A5_0700_TIM_100_6000	Poor Dunsparce probably just wants to live a\nquiet life...
A5_0700_PIKACHU_100_7000	I guess it’ll have to lay low until the rumors die down.
A5_0710_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, Tim. I’ll let you solve this one today!
A5_0710_PIKACHU_100_2000	Gotta test your deductive skills to see how far you’ve\ncome as a detective!
A5_0710_TIM_100_1000	Sure, whatever. Read me the hints.
A5_0710_PIKACHU_100_3000	Here goes! “This sharp-eyed Pokémon keeps watch\nfrom above.”
A5_0710_TIM_100_2000	That’ll be Noctowl.
A5_0710_PIKACHU_100_4000	Next! “This Pokémon bites and eats anything it comes\nacross.”
A5_0710_TIM_100_3000	I’m guessing Deino?
A5_0710_PIKACHU_100_5000	Not bad so far! How ’bout this next one?
A5_0710_PIKACHU_100_6000	“This agile Pokémon has leaves growing on its arms\nand head.”
A5_0710_TIM_100_4000	I think that’s Shiftry... Wait, no! Grovyle!
A5_0710_PIKACHU_100_7000	Wow, you got ’em all! Way to go, Tim!
A5_0710_PIKACHU_100_8000	I can’t believe my little boy has grown up to be such a\nfine young man...
A5_0710_PIKACHU_100_9000	Your dad’s just...so proud of you, son... *sniffle*
A5_0710_TIM_100_5000	OK, quit being so dramatic. Those fake tears are a\nbit much, even for you.
A5_1020_TIM_100_1000	So this is the Pokémon Unity Lab...
A5_1020_RACHEL_100_1000	Hm... Yeah, this is definitely where Mama used\nto work.
A5_1020_RACHEL_100_2000	You’re sure this is where Unitas’s base is?
A5_1020_TIM_100_2000	That’s what I heard... But it seems too quiet,\ndoesn’t it?
A5_1020_TIM_100_3000	It looks like there might be a janitor over there,\nbut still...
A5_1020_RACHEL_100_3000	Yeah, it’s weird... But nowhere NEAR as weird as\nPikachu actually being your dad! I’m still trying to\nwrap my head around that.
A5_1020_RACHEL_100_4000	His body is supposed to be around here\nsomewhere, right?
A5_1020_TIM_100_4000	Yeah... At least that’s what we think.
A5_1020_RACHEL_100_5000	Then we’d better find him.
A5_1020_TIM_100_5000	Let’s look around by ourselves for a bit while we wait\nfor Pikachu.
A5_1020_TIM_100_6000	I’m curious about what’s inside.
A5_1020_RACHEL_100_6000	OK.
A5_1020_TIM_100_7000	Let’s go!
A5_1030_TIM_100_1000	We don’t need to go this way. Let’s look around\noutside the lab.
A5_1050_TIM_100_1000	We don’t need to go this way. Let’s look around\noutside the lab.
A5_1060_TIM_100_1000	Hey, these smaller doors can open slightly!
A5_1060_RACHEL_100_1000	Oh, you’re right! Guess the lock’s broken.
A5_1060_TIM_100_2000	But it feels like they’re chained shut or something on\nthe other side to keep them from opening.
A5_1060_RACHEL_100_2000	We’d better look for another way in.
A5_1061_TIM_100_1000	This door’s locked.
A5_1061_RACHEL_100_1000	Yeah, I don’t think we can get in this way.
A5_1062_TIM_100_1000	Nope, this door’s locked. It won’t budge.
A5_1062_RACHEL_100_1000	I hope we can find a way in.
A5_1063_TIM_100_1000	This door’s locked.
A5_1063_RACHEL_100_1000	Let’s find another entrance.
A5_1065_RACHEL_100_1000	Wow, check out all those steel drums!
A5_1065_TIM_100_1000	Do you think they used them when they were fixing\nthe building?
A5_1080_DUSTDAS_100_1000	Garbaaa!
A5_1080_TIM_100_1000	It’s a Garbodor. Do you think it lives around here?
A5_1080_RACHEL_100_1000	Maybe it’s the janitor’s partner.
A5_1080_RACHEL_100_2000	Garbodor are always hanging around cleaning crews\nand garbage collectors.
A5_1080_TIM_100_2000	You might be right.
A5_1080_TIM_100_3000	Let’s talk to it once Pikachu gets here.
A5_1100_DIGDA_100_1000	Dig!
A5_1100_TIM_100_1000	Oh, a Diglett!
A5_1100_RACHEL_100_1000	Have you seen any suspicious-looking people around\nhere... Wait, I don’t speak Pokémon.
A5_1100_TIM_100_2000	Let’s talk to it again once Pikachu gets here.
A5_1120_MONJARA_100_1000	Tanga tanga!
A5_1120_TIM_100_1000	It’s a Tangela.
A5_1120_RACHEL_100_1000	Mm-hm! Tangela’s whole body is covered in vines,\nwhich it uses to grab all sorts of stuff.
A5_1120_TIM_100_2000	We can ask it some questions once Pikachu joins us.
A5_1130_TIM_100_1000	Excuse me. Do you mind if we ask you a few\nquestions?
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_100_1000	Wh-who are you?
A5_1130_TIM_100_2000	Oh, don’t worry. We’re not suspic—
A5_1130_RACHEL_100_1000	We’re students at Ryme University.
A5_1130_RACHEL_100_2000	We’re researching this area for a class, actually.
A5_1130_RACHEL_100_3000	Would it be OK if we interviewed you?
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_100_2000	Ah, I see. Well, it’s nice to meet such\ndedicated students.
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_100_3000	You caught me by surprise—nobody ever comes\naround here!
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_100_4000	But if you’re here for school, then sure, ask me\nanything you like.
A5_1130_TIM_100_3000	Thanks for the save, Rachel.
A5_1130_RACHEL_100_4000	I got you.
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_200_1000	What do you want to know?
A5_1130_SEL_0_1000	About this facility...
A5_1130_SEL_0_2000	The facility’s past...
A5_1130_SEL_0_3000	About you...
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_300_1000	This place used to be a Pokémon research facility.
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_300_2000	Apparently a bunch of extensive projects and\nwhatnot were being done here.
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_300_3000	But it’s been shuttered since the R incident.
A5_1130_TIM_300_1000	The lab is massive, isn’t it?
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_300_4000	Yeah. It’s so huge, it’s hard to keep clean.
A5_1130_TIM_300_2000	How many entrances are there?
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_300_5000	Entrances? That’s a weird question.
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_300_6000	There are four in total—three large entrances and one\nsmall one.
A5_1130_TIM_300_3000	I see. Must be a pretty big facility, then.
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_300_7000	I’ll say. In fact, this place is so big, you two are\nactually the first people I’ve ever run into.
A5_1130_RACHEL_300_1000	No wonder you were so surprised to see us.
A5_1130_TIM_300_4000	Wait, we’re the first people you’ve seen here?
A5_1130_TIM_300_5000	I didn’t realize how few people came here...
A5_1130_TIM_400_1000	Do you know anything about the incident that\nhappened here?
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_400_1000	Only what I saw on the news.
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_400_2000	Some Pokémon went completely berserk here two\nyears ago because of that R stuff.
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_400_3000	I heard someone actually died because of it.\nIt’s a really tragic story...
A5_1130_RACHEL_400_1000	Yeah, it is...
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_400_4000	This place has been shut down ever since.
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_500_1000	Ryme City hired me to work here.
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_500_2000	The facility may not be in use, but they didn’t want to\njust let it fall into disrepair, either.
A5_1130_TIM_500_1000	Does anyone else work here?
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_500_3000	Occasionally someone comes by to take over one of\nmy shifts, but otherwise, it’s pretty much just me.
A5_1130_LHMANMID01_500_4000	Not many people want to come all the way out here,\nso far from the city.
A5_1140_TIM_100_1000	I think we’ve checked out everything we can for now.
A5_1140_RACHEL_100_1000	Hey, Tim. Can we talk over there for a minute? I think\nwe should discuss the situation.
A5_1140_TIM_100_2000	Yeah, good idea.
A5_1140_TIM_100_3000	We shouldn’t be overheard here.
A5_1140_RACHEL_100_2000	The janitor says he never sees any people\naround here.
A5_1140_TIM_100_4000	And the place has been closed since the incident too.
A5_1140_TIM_100_5000	The building’s definitely locked, so it’d be hard to\nget inside.
A5_1140_RACHEL_100_3000	We don’t have much to go on right now...
A5_1140_TIM_100_6000	Yeah. To learn anything else, we need to talk to\nthe Pokémon.
A5_1140_TIM_100_7000	Guess all we can do for now is wait for Pikachu.
A5_1140_RACHEL_100_4000	Yeah...
A5_1160_TIM_100_1000	Wait a second, Pikachu. Something’s odd about\nthis place.
A5_1160_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hm? What do you mean?
A5_1160_TIM_100_2000	We looked around out here while we were waiting for\nyou, trying to find signs of Unitas’s activity.
A5_1160_TIM_100_3000	Thing is, we didn’t find anything at all.
A5_1160_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hmmm... Now that you mention it, it does seem a\nbit quiet around here.
A5_1160_PIKACHU_100_3000	But based on what I’ve learned from other Pokémon,\nthis place seems like our strongest lead.
A5_1160_PIKACHU_100_4000	And more importantly, I’ve just got a good old-\nfashioned hunch that this is the place!
A5_1160_PIKACHU_100_5000	Unitas is hiding here—I’m sure of it.
A5_1160_TIM_100_4000	But where?
A5_1160_PIKACHU_100_6000	That’s what we’ve gotta find out.
A5_1160_PIKACHU_100_7000	Sounds like you’ve already finished the preliminary\ninvestigation.
A5_1160_PIKACHU_100_8000	Let’s start talking to some Pokémon.
A5_1160_PIKACHU_100_9000	The ones hanging out around here oughta know\nsomething.
A5_1160_TIM_100_5000	Sounds like a plan.
A5_1160_RACHEL_100_1000	You two are gonna conduct some interviews\ntogether, right?
A5_1160_RACHEL_100_2000	In that case, I’ll keep looking around the area.
A5_1160_TIM_100_6000	Thanks, Rachel.
A5_1160_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow?
A5_1160_PIKACHU_100_10000	You and the others can just hang back for now.
A5_1160_PIKACHU_100_11000	We’ll come get you if we need anything.
A5_1160_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro.
A5_1160_PIKACHU_100_12000	All right, Tim—let’s get started!
A5_1165_TIM_100_1000	I’m curious what’s inside the building.
A5_1165_RACHEL_100_1000	Let’s go take a look.
A5_1170_RACHEL_100_1000	Thanks for bringing your friends to help us, Pikachu.
A5_1170_PIKACHU_100_1000	Heh, don’t thank me—thank them!
A5_1170_RACHEL_100_2000	With everyone helping so much, I’d better make sure\nI do my part too!
A5_1170_RACHEL_200_1000	Thanks for bringing your friends to help us, Pikachu.
A5_1180_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow!
A5_1180_TIM_100_1000	I’m glad you came.
A5_1180_GARDIE_100_2000	Gowww!
A5_1180_PIKACHU_100_1000	She’s been wanting to do something to thank us for\nhelping solve the jewel theft case.
A5_1180_TIM_100_2000	O-oh! That’s totally not necessary! But thank you,\nGrowlithe. Really.
A5_1180_GARDIE_100_3000	Growl!
A5_1180_PIKACHU_100_2000	Thanks for having our backs.
A5_1180_TIM_200_1000	We’re counting on you, Growlithe.
A5_1180_GARDIE_200_1000	Gow!
A5_1190_TIM_100_1000	Thanks for coming all this way.
A5_1190_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Darman!
A5_1190_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says it’s only natural to help a friend in need.
A5_1190_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Dar!
A5_1190_TIM_100_2000	We’re grateful for your help, Darmanitan.
A5_1190_TIM_200_1000	We’re grateful for your help, Darmanitan.
A5_1190_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Darman!
A5_1200_TIM_100_1000	Thanks, Luxray.
A5_1200_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux.
A5_1200_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says not to get the wrong idea. He just has the\nsame goals as us right now—that’s all.
A5_1200_TIM_100_2000	But it’s still a big help. We’re glad you’re on our\nside, Luxray.
A5_1200_RENTORAR_100_2000	Lux.
A5_1200_TIM_200_1000	We’re glad you’re on our side, Luxray.
A5_1200_RENTORAR_200_1000	Lux.
A5_1210_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro!
A5_1210_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says he’s not sure how useful he’ll be, but he’ll\nhelp however he can.
A5_1210_TIM_100_1000	Happy to have you with us, Pangoro.
A5_1210_TIM_100_2000	Pikachu, did you go all the way to Bamboo Borough\njust to find Pangoro?
A5_1210_PIKACHU_100_2000	Naw. I got a bird Pokémon to relay the message\nfor me.
A5_1210_PIKACHU_100_3000	Same with all the others.
A5_1210_GORONDA_100_2000	Goro!
A5_1210_PIKACHU_100_4000	He said he’d come help no matter where we are.
A5_1210_TIM_100_3000	Thank you, Pangoro. We really appreciate it.
A5_1210_TIM_200_1000	I feel a lot safer with you here, Pangoro.
A5_1210_GORONDA_200_1000	Goro.
A5_1225_DUSTDAS_100_1000	Garbo!
A5_1225_TIM_100_1000	It’s a Garbodor. What’s it saying?
A5_1225_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s just introducing himself.
A5_1225_PIKACHU_100_2000	That janitor over there is his partner.
A5_1225_TIM_100_2000	Ah, OK. Garbodor eats garbage, so I’m sure he’s a\nhuge help with custodial work!
A5_1225_TIM_100_3000	I guess that also means he comes here often.
A5_1225_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yeah, he might know something. Let’s ask.
A5_1225_DUSTDAS_100_2000	Garbo!
A5_1230_PIKACHU_100_1000	Do you have time to talk, Garbodor?
A5_1230_DUSTDAS_100_1000	Gaaarbo!
A5_1230_SEL_0_1000	About you, Garbodor...
A5_1230_SEL_0_2000	About the building...
A5_1230_DUSTDAS_300_1000	Gaaar.
A5_1230_PIKACHU_300_1000	You help the janitor pick up trash? Sounds like you’re\na hard worker.
A5_1230_DUSTDAS_300_2000	Gaaar gaaar.
A5_1230_PIKACHU_300_2000	Hm? You don’t expect to be praised just for\ncollecting snacks?
A5_1230_PIKACHU_300_3000	Oh, right! Trash is like a treat for you!
A5_1230_TIM_300_1000	Just like that Trubbish we met the other day.
A5_1230_PIKACHU_400_1000	Have you ever seen any other humans here?
A5_1230_DUSTDAS_400_1000	Gaaarbo.
A5_1230_PIKACHU_400_2000	He says he’s never seen any other humans besides\nthe janitor.
A5_1230_TIM_400_1000	That tracks with what the janitor said.
A5_1230_PIKACHU_400_3000	Is there any way to get inside that building?
A5_1230_DUSTDAS_400_2000	Gaaar?
A5_1230_PIKACHU_400_4000	Ah. It’s never been inside.
A5_1230_TIM_400_2000	Gotcha. Well, that doesn’t help us...
A5_1230_PIKACHU_400_5000	Hmm... Have you noticed anything strange around\nhere lately? Anything at all?
A5_1230_DUSTDAS_400_3000	Gar gaaar. Garbooodor!
A5_1230_PIKACHU_400_6000	Sometimes you find strange snacks?
A5_1230_PIKACHU_400_6500	Sorry, but we’re not here to talk about your sna—
A5_1230_DUSTDAS_400_4000	Gaaar.
A5_1230_PIKACHU_400_7000	Hm? Is this one of the snacks you found today?
A5_1230_TIM_400_3000	<color=#F39800FF>It’s a food wrapper.</color>
A5_1230_PIKACHU_400_8000	Why would a used food wrapper be here if people\ndon’t come here?
A5_1230_DUSTDAS_400_5000	Garbobooo.
A5_1230_PIKACHU_400_9000	What?! You find these all the time?!
A5_1230_TIM_400_4000	Even though no one comes here?
A5_1230_PIKACHU_400_10000	Hey, Garbodor, mind if we keep this? We can give\nyou some other trash in exchange.
A5_1230_DUSTDAS_400_6000	Gaaaaaar.
A5_1230_PIKACHU_400_11000	Thanks, Garbodor. This could be the clue we’ve been\nlooking for.
A5_1230_TIM_400_5000	A used food wrapper at a facility no one ever\ngoes to... What could it mean?
A5_1245_DIGDA_100_1000	Dig.
A5_1245_TIM_100_1000	It’s a Diglett. These Pokémon live in the ground.
A5_1245_PIKACHU_100_1000	Huh. Guess that also includes leveled and developed\nplaces like this.
A5_1250_PIKACHU_100_1000	Do you mind if we ask you some questions, Diglett?
A5_1250_DIGDA_100_1000	Dig.
A5_1250_SEL_0_1000	About you, Diglett...
A5_1250_SEL_0_2000	About the building...
A5_1250_PIKACHU_300_1000	Do you live here?
A5_1250_DIGDA_300_1000	Dig!
A5_1250_PIKACHU_300_2000	Ah, this place is nice because it’s comfy digging, eh?
A5_1250_DIGDA_300_2000	Diglett dig.
A5_1250_PIKACHU_300_3000	And it’s nice being able to dig as much as you want\nwithout any humans around, huh?
A5_1250_PIKACHU_300_4000	Humans don’t usually consider Diglett to be\npests, y’know.
A5_1250_PIKACHU_300_5000	Farmers especially love Diglett—the soil is always\nperfectly tilled after you dig through it.
A5_1250_DIGDA_300_3000	Dig?!
A5_1250_PIKACHU_300_6000	Yeah, for real!
A5_1250_TIM_300_1000	Don’t be afraid to visit places with humans around!
A5_1250_TIM_300_2000	I’m sure they’ll be happy to see you!
A5_1250_DIGDA_400_1000	Diglett dig! Diglett dig!
A5_1250_PIKACHU_400_1000	Diglett hasn’t seen any people around, but it did\nmention something pretty interesting...
A5_1250_TIM_400_1000	What’d it say?
A5_1250_PIKACHU_400_2000	Sometimes at night, when Diglett’s underground and\ntrying to sleep, it hears a lot of noise.
A5_1250_TIM_400_2000	Noise underground, you mean?
A5_1250_DIGDA_400_2000	Dig.
A5_1250_PIKACHU_400_3000	Yep. It got curious about the noise and went into the\nbuilding to check it out, but no one was there.
A5_1250_PIKACHU_400_4000	When it went back underground, though, it could still\nhear the noise.
A5_1250_TIM_400_3000	Noise when nobody’s there? Strange.
A5_1250_PIKACHU_400_5000	Wait—how did you get inside the building?
A5_1250_DIGDA_400_3000	Dig!
A5_1250_PIKACHU_400_6000	<color=#F39800FF>It says it dug a hole through the floor of the building.</color>
A5_1250_TIM_400_4000	Wow. It’s surprisingly powerful to be able to dig into\na building from underneath it...
A5_1250_PIKACHU_400_7000	I wonder what that sound underground was.
A5_1265_MONJARA_100_1000	Tanga.
A5_1265_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, you live here? Then you must know a lot about\nthis place.
A5_1270_PIKACHU_100_1000	Do you mind if I ask you some questions?
A5_1270_MONJARA_100_1000	Tangelaaa.
A5_1270_SEL_0_1000	About you, Tangela...
A5_1270_SEL_0_2000	About the building...
A5_1270_PIKACHU_300_1000	What do you do for fun around here?
A5_1270_MONJARA_300_1000	Tangelala.
A5_1270_PIKACHU_300_2000	Sunbathing, eh? Sounds nice and peaceful.
A5_1270_TIM_300_1000	I bet that feels great.
A5_1270_MONJARA_400_1000	Tangle tangle.
A5_1270_PIKACHU_400_1000	You’ve never seen any other people around here\nbesides the janitor?
A5_1270_TIM_400_1000	Wait a second. There’s something caught in Tangela’s\nvines.
A5_1270_PIKACHU_400_2000	<color=#F39800FF>They’re shards of glass. How’d those get there?</color>
A5_1270_MONJARA_400_2000	Tangelaaa.
A5_1270_PIKACHU_400_3000	<color=#F39800FF>You think they might have gotten on you when you\nwent inside the building?</color>
A5_1270_TIM_400_2000	Wait, you’ve been inside?
A5_1270_PIKACHU_400_4000	Hey, Tangela. How did you get inside?
A5_1270_MONJARA_400_3000	Tanglaaa.
A5_1270_PIKACHU_400_5000	The doors right near us?
A5_1270_TIM_400_3000	These smaller doors, huh.
A5_1270_MONJARA_400_4000	Tanga tanga...
A5_1270_PIKACHU_400_6000	What?! These doors were unlocked until just recently?
A5_1270_PIKACHU_400_7000	So now they’re locked, and you can’t get in anymore.
A5_1270_TIM_400_4000	This place has supposedly been shut down for ages.\nWhy would these doors be locked all of a sudden?
A5_1270_PIKACHU_400_8000	I dunno, but it definitely raises some questions.
A5_1275_PIKACHU_100_1000	Tangela was talking about those small doors right\nthere, yeah?
A5_1275_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s turn our attention there, Tim.
A5_1275_TIM_300_1000	When we tried to open them earlier, they were\nchained shut.
A5_1275_TIM_300_2000	Let’s try again now.
A5_1275_TIM_400_1000	We didn’t check that door.
A5_1275_TIM_400_2000	Maybe we can find a way in after all!
A5_1280_LHMANMID01_100_1000	Are all these Pokémon that just showed up with you?
A5_1280_TIM_100_1000	Yeah. Don’t worry, they’re all nice.
A5_1280_TIM_200_1000	Sorry, but could I please ask a few more questions?
A5_1280_LHMANMID01_200_1000	You sure are one dedicated student. What do you\nwant to ask?
A5_1280_SEL_0_1000	About Garbodor...
A5_1280_SEL_0_2000	How do you get into the building?
A5_1280_SEL_0_3000	About this food wrapper...
A5_1280_LHMANMID01_300_1000	Garbodor is my partner.
A5_1280_LHMANMID01_300_2000	He loves garbage and gladly gobbles it all up.
A5_1280_LHMANMID01_400_1000	How do I get in? I don’t! I’ve never been inside.
A5_1280_TIM_400_1000	You don’t clean the inside?
A5_1280_LHMANMID01_400_2000	I’ve only been hired to clean the grounds outside\nthe building.
A5_1280_LHMANMID01_400_3000	I don’t have a key, so I couldn’t get inside even if I\nwanted to.
A5_1280_LHMANMID01_500_1000	Oh, I don’t often see other people’s trash like\nthat here.
A5_1280_LHMANMID01_500_2000	I guess someone came by here after all?
A5_1285_TIM_100_1000	The lock on these doors is broken.
A5_1285_PIKACHU_100_1000	Huh? You mean they’re NOT locked?
A5_1285_TIM_100_2000	Yeah, but they still won’t open. I think they might be\nchained shut from the other side.
A5_1285_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hmm. Interesting...
A5_1290_TIM_100_1000	This door’s locked.
A5_1290_PIKACHU_100_1000	We should look for another way in.
A5_1295_TIM_100_1000	Yep, still locked. I don’t think we can open this.
A5_1295_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hmm. Guess we should look for another way in.
A5_1300_TIM_100_1000	This door’s locked. We can’t get in.
A5_1300_PIKACHU_100_1000	I hope we can find a way inside...
A5_1305_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wow, check out all those steel drums!
A5_1305_TIM_100_1000	Do you think they used them when they were fixing\nthe building?
A5_1305_PIKACHU_100_2000	Even if they did, it’s peak laziness to just leave them\nlaying around like this.
A5_1310_PIKACHU_100_1000	These small doors are definitely the ones Tangela told\nus about.
A5_1310_TIM_100_1000	There’s a chain or something on the other side\nkeeping them from opening.
A5_1310_TIM_100_2000	So they’re locked from the inside... What’s going on?
A5_1310_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hmm...
A5_1310_PIKACHU_100_3000	It’s strange that these doors were unlocked\nuntil recently.
A5_1310_PIKACHU_100_4000	Who locked these doors?
A5_1310_PIKACHU_200_1000	The doors are chained together or something to keep\nthem from opening.
A5_1310_PIKACHU_200_2000	Not much we can do about it from this side.
A5_1315_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, I think we’ve checked everything we can\nfor now.
A5_1315_TIM_100_1000	What do you think, Pikachu? Is Unitas really here?
A5_1315_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, I think chances are pretty good they’re using\nthis place as their base.
A5_1315_PIKACHU_100_3000	I got a few reasons for thinking that.
A5_1315_PIKACHU_100_4000	The first is Diglett’s story about the noises it heard\ncoming from the building.
A5_1315_PIKACHU_100_5000	The second is what Tangela said about those smaller\ndoors being locked from inside.
A5_1315_PIKACHU_100_6000	And the third is the food wrapper that\nGarbodor found.
A5_1315_PIKACHU_100_7000	Any one of those things on their own wouldn’t\nmean much.
A5_1315_TIM_100_2000	But taken all together, we can pretty safely conclude\nthere are people here.
A5_1315_PIKACHU_100_8000	Exactly. I think those things are linked by more\nthan coincidence.
A5_1315_TIM_100_3000	Guess we really do need to look around inside.
A5_1317_PIKACHU_100_1000	The other Pokémon might know something, like\nTangela did.
A5_1317_TIM_100_1000	Good thinking. Let’s make sure we talk to them all.
A5_1320_RACHEL_100_1000	I wish we could look inside.
A5_1320_TIM_100_1000	But the front entrance is locked.
A5_1320_RACHEL_100_2000	Isn’t there another way we could get inside?
A5_1320_RACHEL_200_1000	Isn’t there another way we could get inside?
A5_1330_TIM_100_1000	We can’t get in because it’s locked.
A5_1330_PIKACHU_100_1000	Then we oughta look for another way inside.
A5_1331_TIM_100_1000	We can’t get in because it’s locked.
A5_1331_PIKACHU_100_2000	Then we oughta look for another way inside.
A5_1332_TIM_100_1000	We can’t get in because it’s locked.
A5_1332_PIKACHU_100_1000	Then we oughta look for another way inside.
A5_1333_TIM_100_1000	We can’t get in because it’s locked.
A5_1333_PIKACHU_100_1000	Then we oughta look for another way inside.
A5_1340_TIM_100_1000	If we’re hoping to follow a scent, then it’s time to ask\nfor Growlithe’s help.
A5_1340_PIKACHU_100_1000	Agreed. Good thing I asked her to come!
A5_1340_PIKACHU_100_2000	Now let’s go ask her!
A5_1350_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow?
A5_1350_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Growlithe. We need your help with something.
A5_1350_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’d like you to track down the scent from\nthis wrapper.
A5_1350_GARDIE_100_2000	Gow!
A5_1350_PIKACHU_100_3000	Piece of cake, huh? Just what I wanted to hear.
A5_1350_PIKACHU_100_4000	You OK with us getting right to it, Tim?
A5_1350_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_1350_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_1350_TIM_300_1000	Please do.
A5_1350_PIKACHU_300_1000	OK! Let’s do it just like last time, Growlithe.
A5_1350_GARDIE_300_1000	Growliii!
A5_1350_TIM_400_1000	Wait a minute. There’s something I’d like us to look\ninto first.
A5_1350_PIKACHU_400_1000	Still wondering about something, huh?
A5_1350_PIKACHU_400_2000	All right. Let’s follow the scent after we finish\nthat, then.
A5_1350_PIKACHU_400_3000	Hold tight for a sec, Growlithe.
A5_1350_GARDIE_400_1000	Gow!
A5_1360_TIM_100_1000	Can you track the scent on this wrapper?
A5_1360_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Darma...
A5_1360_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says he can’t do that.
A5_1360_TIM_100_2000	Yeah, that’s what I figured...
A5_1370_TIM_100_1000	I don’t suppose you could track the scent on this\nwrapper...could you?
A5_1370_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux.
A5_1370_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says not to waste his time asking questions you\nalready know the answer to.
A5_1370_TIM_100_2000	Yeah, uh, sorry about that...
A5_1380_TIM_100_1000	Do you think you could track the scent on this\nwrapper?
A5_1380_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro...
A5_1380_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says his sense of smell isn’t that good.
A5_1380_TIM_100_2000	I thought not. Thanks anyway, Pangoro.
A5_1390_TIM_100_1000	Pikachu says the scent continues past here.
A5_1390_RACHEL_100_1000	But there’s no way to get back there to search.
A5_1390_TIM_100_2000	Yeah, it’d take all day to move this many steel drums.
A5_1390_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hmm... Guess we’re gonna have to get smashy.
A5_1390_TIM_100_3000	Wha—?! You’ve gotta be kidding!
A5_1390_PIKACHU_100_2000	I know it’s a rough approach, but we don’t have\ntime to dawdle.
A5_1390_PIKACHU_100_3000	The drums at least seem to be empty, so I’m sure we\ncan enlist one of our pals to help.
A5_1390_TIM_100_4000	Have you always approached your investigations\nthis way?
A5_1390_PIKACHU_100_4000	Depends on the situation. It’s a great detective’s job\nto find the shortest route to the truth.
A5_1390_PIKACHU_100_5000	So, who should we ask for help?
A5_1400_RACHEL_100_1000	If the scent continues past this point, does that mean\nthe food wrapper blew in from back there?
A5_1400_RACHEL_100_2000	And it’s pretty weird there are this many steel drums\nhere in the first place.
A5_1400_TIM_100_1000	It kinda looks like someone’s hiding something.
A5_1400_RACHEL_100_3000	But why would someone do that?
A5_1400_TIM_100_2000	I don’t know, but if we can get past these drums, we\nmight be able to find out.
A5_1400_RACHEL_200_1000	We’d better be careful if we’re going inside.
A5_1410_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow?
A5_1410_PIKACHU_100_1000	I don’t think Growlithe can break these steel drums.
A5_1410_GARDIE_100_2000	Gowww...
A5_1410_TIM_100_1000	It’s all right. If we think of something else you can\nhelp with, we’ll be sure to come get you.
A5_1420_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Darmaaan!
A5_1420_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says he can handle anything that calls for\nbrute strength.
A5_1420_TIM_100_1000	In that case, I think Darmanitan is definitely the best\none to ask for help with this!
A5_1420_PIKACHU_100_2000	Want us to get started right away, Tim?
A5_1420_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_1420_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_1420_TIM_300_1000	Yeah. Just be careful not to hurt yourself.
A5_1420_PIKACHU_300_1000	We’re counting on that strength of yours, Darmanitan.\nYou ready to do this?
A5_1420_GHIHIDARUMA_300_1000	Darmaaan!
A5_1420_TIM_400_1000	No, wait. There’s something I wanted to look into a\nlittle more first.
A5_1420_PIKACHU_400_1000	Gotcha. We’ll do this once you’re finished.
A5_1430_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux.
A5_1430_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says we’d have better luck asking someone\nbrawnier than him.
A5_1430_TIM_100_1000	Maybe we should ask Darmanitan or Pangoro.
A5_1440_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro.
A5_1440_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says he’s better at moving things. If we wanna\nbreak something, we should ask Darmanitan.
A5_1440_PIKACHU_100_2000	You’re right, Pangoro. We’ll ask him instead.
A5_1450_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s definitely something beyond here.
A5_1450_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s ask someone who can smash these steel drums.
A5_1500_TIM_100_1000	You’re right—it looks like we can get inside through\nthis hole.
A5_1500_PIKACHU_100_1000	Are you ready to head in, Tim?
A5_1500_TIM_100_2000	Of course. That’s why we’re here.
A5_1500_PIKACHU_100_2000	All right. Let’s do it.
A5_1630_TIM_100_1000	So this is what the inside of the lab looks like...\nIt sure is messed up.
A5_1630_PIKACHU_100_1000	... ... ...
A5_1630_TIM_100_2000	Did you hear me, Pikachu?
A5_1630_PIKACHU_100_2000	Huh? Oh, er... I was just so shocked by how trashed\nthis place is. Kinda speechless.
A5_1630_TIM_100_3000	Yeah. I know they weren’t doing any upkeep, but\nwould it really get this bad in just two years?
A5_1630_RACHEL_100_1000	So this is where it happened...
A5_1630_TIM_100_4000	Hm? What’s up, Rachel?
A5_1630_RACHEL_100_2000	This must be where the Pokémon went berserk during\nthe R incident two years ago...
A5_1630_RACHEL_100_3000	That’s why there’s a hole in the wall and the room’s\nin such disarray.
A5_1630_PIKACHU_100_3000	I see... This place must have been left just as it was\nat the time of the incident.
A5_1630_RACHEL_100_4000	Mama must have been...
A5_1630_TIM_100_5000	Are you OK, Rachel? If being here’s too painful, it’s\ntotally fine if you want to wait outside.
A5_1630_RACHEL_100_5000	I...think I just need a moment to myself, if that’s\nall right.
A5_1630_RACHEL_100_6000	I thought I was ready for this, but it’s hitting me\nharder than I expected...
A5_1630_TIM_100_6000	Take your time. I understand.
A5_1630_PIKACHU_100_4000	Poor girl. I’m sure she would’ve preferred to steer\nclear of this place.
A5_1630_PIKACHU_100_5000	But all signs point to Unitas being here.
A5_1630_PIKACHU_100_6000	Let’s start looking for clues.
A5_1630_TIM_100_7000	Right.
A5_1630_PIKACHU_100_7000	Hmm... Something felt strange when I came into\nthis room...
A5_1630_PIKACHU_100_8000	What could that have been...
A5_1640_PIKACHU_100_1000	Where are you going? We don’t need to go outside.
A5_1640_TIM_100_1000	You’re right. Let’s look around in here.
A5_1650_RACHEL_100_1000	I’m sorry, Tim. I hope I’m not holding you back.
A5_1650_TIM_100_1000	No worries. Take your time.
A5_1650_RACHEL_100_2000	Thanks... But I’m worried about Papa too. I can’t just\nstand here and brood forever.
A5_1650_RACHEL_100_3000	I just need to rest a sec, then I can help—promise!
A5_1650_TIM_100_2000	Thanks, Rachel.
A5_1650_PIKACHU_100_1000	This must be really hard for her, but she’s doing a\ngreat job hanging in there.
A5_1650_RACHEL_200_1000	I just need to rest a sec, then I can help—promise!
A5_1660_GARDIE_300_1000	Gow!
A5_1660_PIKACHU_300_1000	Yeah, we’ll let you know if we need your help again.
A5_1660_GARDIE_400_1000	Gow!
A5_1660_PIKACHU_400_1000	She said she saw something glimmering inside the\ncupboard.
A5_1660_TIM_400_1000	The cupboard right in front of her? Let’s take a look.
A5_1670_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux.
A5_1670_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says this place looks even rougher than the\npolice station. Can’t say I disagree.
A5_1670_TIM_100_1000	Everything’s trashed here...
A5_1670_RENTORAR_200_1000	Lux.
A5_1670_PIKACHU_200_1000	He says this place looks even rougher than the\npolice station. Can’t say I disagree.
A5_1680_PIKACHU_100_1000	This must be the door Tangela was talking about.
A5_1680_TIM_100_1000	I assumed we’d be able to open it from the inside,\nbut it’s got a lock on it.
A5_1680_PIKACHU_100_2000	This door’s the only way Pangoro and Darminatan can\nget inside. We’ll have to find the key.
A5_1680_TIM_200_1000	We need to hurry and find the key so we can get this\nchain out of the way.
A5_1690_TIM_100_1000	Look, footprints. Are they human?
A5_1690_PIKACHU_100_1000	Couldn’t be, they’re too big.
A5_1690_PIKACHU_100_2000	There’s no dust over ’em either, so they must\nbe recent.
A5_1690_PIKACHU_100_3000	I think these are probably <color=#F39800FF>Tangela’s footprints</color>.
A5_1690_TIM_100_2000	I see. It must’ve left these footprints when it came\ninside.
A5_1690_PIKACHU_200_1000	These must be Tangela’s footprints.
A5_1700_TIM_100_1000	There’s a note here.
A5_1700_PIKACHU_100_1000	Read it aloud, would ya?
A5_1700_TIM_100_2000	“From the Management Team—Regarding Search\nProcedures.
A5_1700_TIM_100_3000	“Upon discovery of the object in question, collect it\nimmediately.
A5_1700_TIM_100_4000	“Once the object is collected, use concrete to seal off\nthe first-floor hallway.
A5_1700_TIM_100_5000	“Please be aware of the following:
A5_1700_TIM_100_6000	“Destroy the switchboard on the first floor.
A5_1700_TIM_100_7000	“Do not leave any trash behind, such as food or drink\ncontainers.”
A5_1700_TIM_100_8000	“Due to the building’s dilapidated state, watch your\nstep as you move about.”
A5_1700_TIM_100_9000	<color=#F39800FF>These appear to be instructions of some kind.</color>
A5_1700_PIKACHU_100_2000	What do you suppose this “management team” is?
A5_1700_TIM_100_10000	I have no idea...
A5_1700_TIM_100_11000	But at least now we know for sure that people have\nbeen here.
A5_1700_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yeah. We still don’t know who’s been here or how\nmany of ’em there are...
A5_1700_PIKACHU_100_4000	But they were clearly following orders to search\nfor something.
A5_1700_TIM_100_12000	But how did they get out of here?
A5_1700_PIKACHU_100_5000	Good question. The door was locked from\nthe inside...
A5_1700_TIM_100_13000	And why did the note say to seal off a hallway\nwith concrete?
A5_1700_PIKACHU_100_6000	There’s still a lot we don’t understand. Let’s keep\ninvestigating.
A5_1700_TIM_200_1000	It’s the note from the management team.
A5_1700_PIKACHU_200_1000	There’s still a lot we don’t understand. Let’s keep\ninvestigating.
A5_1710_TIM_100_1000	Look, Pikachu. There’s another food wrapper on\nthe floor.
A5_1710_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s the same as the one we got from Garbodor.
A5_1710_TIM_100_2000	That means <color=#F39800FF>this trash is another piece of evidence\nthat people have been in and out of this place</color>.
A5_1710_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah—and there might be more proof too. Let’s keep\nlooking.
A5_1710_TIM_200_1000	This wrapper is the same as the one we got from\nGarbodor!
A5_1710_PIKACHU_200_1000	So, whoever threw it away did come in here.
A5_1720_TIM_100_1000	What do you think this stain is? Kinda looks like a\nchemical spill or something...
A5_1720_PIKACHU_100_1000	Maybe some chemicals spilled during the Pokémon\nrampage.
A5_1720_PIKACHU_100_3000	Based on the smell and how dusty it is, <color=#F39800FF>I’m guessing\nthis isn’t a recent stain</color>.
A5_1720_PIKACHU_100_4000	Still, we don’t know what chemical this was. We’d\nbetter not touch it.
A5_1720_TIM_200_1000	This stain looks like some kinda chemical spill.
A5_1720_PIKACHU_200_1000	Based on the smell and how dusty it is, I’m guessing\nthis isn’t a recent stain.
A5_1730_TIM_100_1000	The switchboard panel is open.
A5_1730_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s completely busted inside. I guess this is why\nthere’s no electricity.
A5_1730_PIKACHU_300_1000	That note said to destroy the switchboard on the first\nfloor, remember?
A5_1730_TIM_300_1000	So someone did this on purpose.
A5_1730_TIM_300_2000	But why would they NEED to do this?
A5_1730_PIKACHU_300_2000	They probably wanted to make it look like the first\nfloor didn’t have electricity.
A5_1730_TIM_300_3000	To make this place look shut down and abandoned?
A5_1730_PIKACHU_300_3000	I think so. It seems pretty likely.
A5_1730_PIKACHU_300_4000	Especially since that note seemed to contain\ninstructions for keeping something hidden.
A5_1730_TIM_400_1000	“Busted” doesn’t even begin to describe the state of\nthis switchboard. It looks like someone completely\ndestroyed it.
A5_1730_PIKACHU_400_1000	Yeah, it wouldn’t get this damaged unless someone\ndid it on purpose.
A5_1730_PIKACHU_400_2000	Take it from me, a guy who knows a thing or two\nabout this sorta electrical stuff.
A5_1730_TIM_400_2000	But who would do this?
A5_1730_PIKACHU_400_3000	Hmm...
A5_1740_PIKACHU_100_1000	The lab’s scientists must have used this cupboard.\nWhat’s up there?
A5_1740_PIKACHU_100_2000	I can’t see what’s on the shelves—you gotta tell me!
A5_1740_TIM_100_1000	Wait a second. I’m looking.
A5_1740_TIM_100_2000	Looks like it’s just chemicals and stuff...
A5_1740_TIM_100_3000	Hm? What’s this?
A5_1740_TIM_100_4000	It’s a key.
A5_1740_TIM_200_1000	Other than the key, it’s just chemicals and stuff.
A5_1740_PIKACHU_200_1000	The researchers who worked here were\nprobably using them.
A5_1740_PIKACHU_300_1000	Maybe this is the key to the way in?
A5_1740_TIM_300_1000	Looks like it might fit, yeah. Let’s try it.
A5_1740_PIKACHU_400_1000	What a weird place to keep a key. Wonder what\nit’s for.
A5_1740_TIM_400_1000	Let’s take it with us. We might be able to use it later.
A5_1760_TIM_100_1000	Can Growlithe pick up the scent to the sealed-off\nhallway?
A5_1760_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow...
A5_1760_PIKACHU_100_1000	She says it’s too dusty in here.
A5_1760_GARDIE_200_1000	Gow...
A5_1760_PIKACHU_200_1000	Guess the dust makes it too hard to track.
A5_1780_PIKACHU_100_1000	These are the doors we couldn’t open because of\nthe chain.
A5_1780_TIM_300_1000	I hope this key opens the lock on the chain...
A5_1780_PIKACHU_300_1000	Won’t know unless we try.
A5_1780_TIM_300_2000	I’ll just put the key in the lock...
A5_1780_TIM_300_3000	All right! That takes care of the chain!
A5_1780_GHIHIDARUMA_300_1000	Daaar!
A5_1780_GORONDA_300_1000	Goro!
A5_1780_PIKACHU_300_2000	Sorry to keep you two waiting.
A5_1780_PIKACHU_400_1000	The chain’s fastened with a padlock.
A5_1780_PIKACHU_400_1500	We need to get this unlocked so Darmanitan and\nPangoro can get in here.
A5_1780_TIM_400_2000	Sure would be convenient if that key we found earlier\nis for this lock.
A5_1780_PIKACHU_400_2000	Let’s give it a try.
A5_1780_TIM_400_3000	Here goes...
A5_1780_TIM_400_4000	All right! That takes care of the chain!
A5_1780_GHIHIDARUMA_400_1000	Darmaaa!
A5_1780_GORONDA_400_1000	Gorooo!
A5_1780_PIKACHU_400_3000	Sorry for the wait, fellas!
A5_1790_PIKACHU_100_1000	So, Tim, what’re your thoughts after looking the\nroom over?
A5_1790_TIM_100_1000	It’s pretty clear that someone’s been coming in here.
A5_1790_TIM_100_2000	And based on that note, we know they had a purpose\nfor doing so.
A5_1790_PIKACHU_100_2000	Right. We’re light on details, but we know something\nfishy’s going on.
A5_1790_PIKACHU_100_3000	We should try to figure out what exactly\nhappened here.
A5_1800_TIM_100_1000	Now all we have to do is investigate the room.
A5_1800_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. Keep a sharp eye out for anything unusual.
A5_1810_PIKACHU_100_1000	Where are you going? We don’t need to go outside.
A5_1810_TIM_100_1000	Right. Let’s look around inside the building.
A5_1820_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar?
A5_1820_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s asking when you’re gonna need him.
A5_1820_TIM_100_1000	We’re OK for now, but I’ll let you know when we\ncould use your help.
A5_1820_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Dar!
A5_1820_PIKACHU_200_1000	He says he’ll just wait here until you need his help.
A5_1830_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro.
A5_1830_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says he’s ready whenever you need him. All you\ngotta do is ask.
A5_1830_TIM_100_1000	Appreciate it!
A5_1830_GORONDA_200_1000	Goro.
A5_1830_PIKACHU_200_1000	He says he’s ready whenever you need him. All you\ngotta do is ask.
A5_1840_PIKACHU_100_1000	If we’re looking for a hallway that’s been sealed up,\nwe should probably ask one of our friends for help.
A5_1840_TIM_100_1000	Yeah. Let’s go ask.
A5_1850_TIM_100_1000	Luxray’s special vision might be able to find\nsomething...
A5_1850_PIKACHU_100_1000	Whaddya think? Time to get Luxray’s help?
A5_1850_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_1850_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_1850_PIKACHU_300_1000	All right, Luxray, let’s do this!
A5_1850_RENTORAR_300_1000	Lux.
A5_1850_PIKACHU_400_1000	Let’s think a bit more.
A5_1850_RENTORAR_400_1000	Raaay.
A5_1870_RACHEL_100_1000	Who’d have thought there’d be a secret hallway\nbehind that wall?
A5_1870_RACHEL_100_2000	I bet there’s stuff going on back there that someone\ndoesn’t want us to see.
A5_1870_RACHEL_100_3000	Let’s go, Tim!
A5_1870_RACHEL_200_1000	Let’s go, Tim!
A5_1880_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow!
A5_1880_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s a strange smell coming from up ahead?
A5_1880_TIM_100_1000	Do you know what it is?
A5_1880_GARDIE_100_2000	Gow...
A5_1880_PIKACHU_100_2000	She says she’s not sure. Let’s be careful as we keep\ngoing.
A5_1880_GARDIE_200_1000	Gow!
A5_1880_PIKACHU_200_1000	She says there’s a strange smell coming from\nup ahead.
A5_1890_TIM_100_1000	Thanks, Darmanitan. That was a huge help.
A5_1890_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar!
A5_1890_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says it’s the least he could do.
A5_1890_TIM_100_2000	If we still need your help later on, we’ll be sure to\nask you!
A5_1890_TIM_200_1000	Thanks, Darmanitan. That was a huge help.
A5_1890_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Dar!
A5_1900_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux.
A5_1900_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says that was unnecessarily dramatic.
A5_1900_TIM_100_1000	This was the only way to get through...
A5_1900_RENTORAR_200_1000	Lux.
A5_1900_PIKACHU_200_1000	He says that was unnecessarily dramatic.
A5_19001_TIM_100_1000	These are the medals we received.
A5_19001_PIKACHU_100_1000	They’re proof of all the good we’ve done with our\ngreat detective work. Let’s keep it up, Tim!
A5_19002_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a bamboo charcoal pizza we brought back from\nBamboo Borough. They sure make a mean pie.
A5_19002_TIM_100_1000	They sure do. It was super generous of the manager\nto thank us for our help with free pizza.
A5_19002_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’ve still got leftovers from yesterday. Maybe I’ll\nhave a nibble before we head out...
A5_19010_TIM_100_1000	“Pokémon Unity Lab,” huh?
A5_19010_RACHEL_100_1000	This is where Mama used to work.
A5_19020_TIM_100_1000	“Pokémon Unity Lab,” huh?
A5_19020_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s definitely something going on here.
A5_19020_PIKACHU_100_2000	And we’re gonna find out what!
A5_1910_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro.
A5_1910_PIKACHU_100_1000	Pangoro thinks he and Darmanitan can get through\nthis time.
A5_1910_TIM_100_1000	Good! We wouldn’t want to make you wait here!
A5_1910_GORONDA_200_1000	Goro.
A5_1910_PIKACHU_200_1000	Pangoro thinks he and Darmanitan can get through\nthis time.
A5_19110_TIM_100_1000	What do you suppose these chemicals are used for?
A5_19110_PIKACHU_100_1000	Careful, Tim! The last thing we need right now is you\nhurting yourself.
A5_19110_TIM_100_2000	Yeah, I know! You worry too much.
A5_19120_PIKACHU_100_1000	Lemme know if you see anything strange. I can’t see\nwhat’s up there from down here.
A5_19120_TIM_100_1000	If I see anything, you’ll be the first to know.
A5_19130_TIM_100_1000	Everything’s a mess inside the cabinets.
A5_19130_PIKACHU_100_1000	This wasn’t done by a rampaging Pokémon. Someone\nmust’ve been searching the room for something.
A5_1930_PIKACHU_100_1000	I wonder what’s past these stairs.
A5_1930_TIM_100_1000	Only one way to find out.
A5_1930_TIM_100_2000	Are you ready to go down there too, Rachel?
A5_1930_RACHEL_100_1000	Yeah. Thanks, Tim. I’m OK now.
A5_1930_RACHEL_100_2000	I need to know how Papa and Unitas are connected.
A5_1930_PIKACHU_100_2000	OK! Let’s go, everyone!
A5_20110_TIM_100_1000	Do you want to stop riding Growlithe?
A5_20110_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_20110_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_20110_TIM_300_1000	Be careful getting down. I’ll lend you a hand.
A5_20110_PIKACHU_300_1000	You worry too much, Tim.
A5_20110_TIM_400_1000	Just let me know when you want to get down.
A5_20115_PIKACHU_100_1000	Can you try tracking the scent from around the small\ndoor by Tangela?
A5_20115_GARDIE_100_1000	(Sure can!)
A5_20120_PIKACHU_100_1000	We don’t need to go this way. Let’s investigate\nthe lab.
A5_20140_PIKACHU_100_1000	We don’t need to go this way. Let’s investigate\nthe lab.
A5_20150_RACHEL_100_1000	Are you tracking a scent? Best of luck, you two!
A5_20150_GARDIE_100_1000	(We’ll do our best!)
A5_20150_PIKACHU_100_1000	We got this!
A5_20160_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(When do you need my help?)
A5_20160_PIKACHU_100_1000	Just sit tight. I’m sure we’ll need your help soon!
A5_20165_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Just let me know when you need me!)
A5_20170_RENTORAR_100_1000	(It’s quite handy to be able to track scents.)
A5_20170_GARDIE_100_1000	(Yeah, I guess I AM kinda useful, huh?)
A5_20170_PIKACHU_100_1000	No “kinda” about it! You’ve helped a ton!
A5_20175_RENTORAR_100_1000	(We’re counting on you to do the tracking.)
A5_20180_GORONDA_100_1000	(This’d go a lot faster if we just went in through the\nfront door.)
A5_20180_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, we don’t wanna do anything rash. We need to\ngo about this carefully.
A5_20185_GORONDA_100_1000	(This’d go a lot faster if we just went in through the\nfront door.)
A5_20190_GARDIE_100_1000	(The same smell is coming from inside.)
A5_20190_PIKACHU_100_1000	So that trash came from inside, after all.
A5_20190_PIKACHU_100_2000	There must be another place the scent leads to.
A5_20190_PIKACHU_100_3000	Please track it down.
A5_20200_DUSTDAS_100_1000	(Find anything tasty on the ground?)
A5_20200_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ll be sure to let you know if we find anything!
A5_20210_DIGDA_100_1000	(The dirt around here is the best for digging!)
A5_20210_PIKACHU_100_1000	Huh. Y’know, I’ve never actually thought about there\nbeing different types of dirt.
A5_20220_MONJARA_100_1000	(Huh. I guess that glass must’ve been stuck in my\nvines for a really long time...)
A5_20220_PIKACHU_100_1000	You don’t seem too bothered about it.
A5_20230_LHMANMID01_100_1000	I’ve never seen a Pikachu ride a Growlithe before.\nHow cool!
A5_20230_PIKACHU_100_1000	Uh, yeah, thanks...
A5_20240_GARDIE_100_1000	(Huh? The scent suddenly disappeared...)
A5_20240_PIKACHU_100_1000	It disappeared?
A5_20240_GARDIE_100_2000	(Well, sort of. It’s more like the scent goes on past this\npoint, actually.)
A5_20240_PIKACHU_100_2000	Past these steel drums, you mean?
A5_20240_PIKACHU_100_3000	I guess we’d better do something about ’em if we\nwanna go any further...
A5_20240_PIKACHU_100_4000	Let’s go get Tim and the others.
A5_2030_TIM_100_1000	I didn’t realize this place had such a big basement.
A5_2030_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. The floors above aren’t in use anymore, but it\nsure looks like this one is.
A5_2030_RACHEL_100_1000	If Unitas would go so far as to seal up a hallway, they\nmust be keeping some pretty big secrets down here.
A5_2030_TIM_100_2000	And now it’s time for us to uncover them.
A5_2030_RACHEL_100_2000	Yeah... Let’s go.
A5_2030_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hm? What’s this...feeling?
A5_2030_TIM_100_3000	What’s wrong?
A5_2030_PIKACHU_100_3000	I think we’re getting closer to my body.
A5_2030_TIM_100_4000	You can tell?
A5_2030_PIKACHU_100_4000	Apparently, yeah. I wonder if Mewtwo’s power has\nanything to do with it.
A5_2030_TIM_100_5000	So...Dad’s body is somewhere in this building.
A5_2030_PIKACHU_100_5000	Oh, and one more thing.
A5_2030_PIKACHU_100_6000	It feels like Pikachu’s consciousness is growing weaker\ninside me.
A5_2030_TIM_100_6000	Weaker? Why?
A5_2030_PIKACHU_100_7000	It could be because I know who I am again, memories\nand all.
A5_2030_TIM_100_7000	Oh no...
A5_2030_PIKACHU_100_8000	I don’t know how long Pikachu can hold out, so we\ncan’t afford to dawdle.
A5_2030_TIM_100_8000	Don’t worry. We won’t let Pikachu’s\nconsciousness disappear!
A5_2030_TIM_100_9000	I swear I’ll find a way to return you two to normal!
A5_2030_PIKACHU_100_9000	Tim...
A5_2030_NOFACEANNOUNCE02_100_1000	We will now be conducting the final test of the cubes.
A5_2030_NOFACEANNOUNCE02_100_2000	Management and operations teams, please stand\nby on the bottom floor, B5.
A5_2030_TIM_100_10000	That broadcast just now...
A5_2030_PIKACHU_100_10000	Sounds like there’s a lot to investigate.
A5_20310_TIM_100_1000	Do you want to get down from Darmanitan?
A5_20310_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_20310_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_20310_TIM_300_1000	Be careful getting down. I’ll lend you a hand.
A5_20310_PIKACHU_300_1000	You worry too much, Tim.
A5_20310_TIM_400_1000	Just let me know when you want to get down.
A5_20320_PIKACHU_100_1000	We don’t need to go this way. Let’s investigate\nthe lab.
A5_20340_PIKACHU_100_1000	We don’t need to go this way. Let’s investigate\nthe lab.
A5_20350_RACHEL_100_1000	Oh, Darmanitan’s gonna break the steel drums for us?
A5_20350_RACHEL_100_2000	Thanks, Darmanitan!
A5_20350_PIKACHU_100_1000	Rachel’s counting on you!
A5_20350_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Yeah! Leave it to me!)
A5_20360_GARDIE_100_1000	(You can even break those steel drums, Darmanitan?\nThat’s incredible!)
A5_20360_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Yep, it’s what I do best!)
A5_20360_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(That nose of yours is awesome, though! I could never\ndo what you do!)
A5_20360_GARDIE_100_2000	(Really? Eh heh heh...)
A5_20365_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(That nose of yours is awesome! I could never do\nwhat you do!)
A5_20365_GARDIE_100_1000	(Really? Eh heh heh...)
A5_20370_RENTORAR_100_1000	(I think we can safely leave the feats of strength\nto you.)
A5_20370_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Yeah, I’m good at smashing stuff!)
A5_20375_RENTORAR_100_1000	(I think we can safely leave the feats of strength\nto you.)
A5_20380_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(You want me to break the drums?)
A5_20380_GORONDA_100_1000	(Yeah. I’m not great at that sorta thing.)
A5_20380_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(But you look so strong!)
A5_20380_GORONDA_100_2000	(Sure, but I’m not good at controlling my strength.\nI’d likely break a lot more than just the drums.)
A5_20385_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(You want me to break the drums?)
A5_20385_GORONDA_100_1000	(Yeah. I’m not great at that sorta thing.)
A5_20390_PIKACHU_100_1000	These doors are locked and won’t open...
A5_2040_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s no reason for us to go back upstairs. Let’s\nkeep investigating this floor.
A5_20400_DUSTDAS_100_1000	(Find anything tasty on the ground?)
A5_20400_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ll be sure to let you know if we find anything!
A5_20410_DIGDA_100_1000	(The dirt around here is the best for digging!)
A5_20410_PIKACHU_100_1000	Huh. Y’know, I’ve never actually thought about there\nbeing different types of dirt.
A5_20420_MONJARA_100_1000	(When did that stuff get stuck to me?)
A5_20420_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m surprised you didn’t notice. Careful not to hurt\nyourself, OK?
A5_20430_LHMANMID01_100_1000	A Pokémon riding another Pokémon? You don’t see\nthat every day.
A5_20430_PIKACHU_100_1000	Only when I’m around.
A5_20440_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(You want me to break these?)
A5_20440_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, smash ’em to bits!
A5_20440_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(Got it! I’ll go all out!)
A5_20450_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s a hole in the wall.
A5_20450_PIKACHU_100_2000	I wonder if that trash from before blew out of here...
A5_20450_GARDIE_100_1000	(Yeah, I think it did!)
A5_20450_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Me and Pangoro won’t fit through that hole...)
A5_20450_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(So we’ll have to smash open a BIGGER one!)
A5_20450_PIKACHU_100_3000	Whoa, whoa! If you do that, the whole building\ncould collapse!
A5_20450_PIKACHU_100_4000	We’ll unlock the doors from inside. For now, you two\ncan just wait here.
A5_20450_GHIHIDARUMA_100_3000	(If you say so...)
A5_20450_PIKACHU_100_5000	Tim! Check this out!
A5_2050_RACHEL_100_1000	The vibe down here is way different compared to\nupstairs.
A5_2050_RACHEL_100_2000	And I’ve got a bad feeling about that broadcast we\njust heard...
A5_2050_TIM_100_1000	We’ll need to proceed carefully down here if we want\nto expose this organization’s plan.
A5_2050_TIM_100_2000	For now, I think it’s best if just Pikachu and I take a\nlook around.
A5_2050_RACHEL_100_3000	Got it. I’ll wait here.
A5_2050_RACHEL_200_1000	I’ll stay here.
A5_2060_TIM_100_1000	You look nervous, Growlithe. Are you OK?
A5_2060_GARDIE_100_1000	Grrr...grrrow!
A5_2060_PIKACHU_100_1000	She’s scared, but she says she won’t let that stop her.
A5_2060_TIM_100_2000	Thanks, Growlithe. We’re glad to have you with us.
A5_2060_TIM_200_1000	You look nervous, Growlithe. Are you OK?
A5_2060_GARDIE_200_1000	Grrr...grrrow!
A5_2060_PIKACHU_200_1000	She’s scared, but she says she won’t let that stop her.
A5_2070_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar?
A5_2070_PIKACHU_100_1000	“What is this place?” Heh, I’m wondering that myself.
A5_2070_TIM_100_1000	We’ll only know if we investigate.
A5_2070_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Dar?
A5_2070_PIKACHU_200_1000	“What is this place?” Heh, I’m wondering that myself.
A5_20710_TIM_100_1000	Do you want to stop riding Luxray?
A5_20710_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_20710_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_20710_TIM_300_1000	Be careful getting down. I’ll lend you a hand.
A5_20710_PIKACHU_300_1000	You worry too much, Tim.
A5_20710_TIM_400_1000	Just let me know when you want to get down.
A5_20720_RACHEL_100_1000	Oh, Luxray’s helping out?
A5_20720_RACHEL_100_2000	Good luck, you two.
A5_20730_GARDIE_100_1000	(Achoo!)
A5_20730_PIKACHU_100_1000	Seems like all this dust is giving you some trouble.
A5_20730_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Yes, that’s one of the drawbacks to having a superior\nsense of smell.)
A5_20740_GARDIE_100_1000	(Achoo!)
A5_20740_PIKACHU_100_1000	Seems like all this dust is giving you some trouble.
A5_20750_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(I’m ready to help whenever you need!)
A5_20750_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’re still investigating. Just hang out here for a bit.
A5_20750_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(Got it. Just lemme know when you need me!)
A5_20760_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Any time you need my power, just say the word!)
A5_20760_PIKACHU_100_1000	We will, Darmanitan! Thanks!
A5_20770_GORONDA_100_1000	(What should I be doing?)
A5_20770_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’re still investigating. Just hang out here for a bit.
A5_20770_GORONDA_100_2000	(OK. Let me know if you need me.)
A5_20780_GORONDA_100_1000	(I don’t know much about this detecting stuff. I’ll just\nleave that to you.)
A5_20790_PIKACHU_100_1000	We don’t need to go outside. Let’s keep investigating\nhere in the building.
A5_20790_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Understood.)
A5_2080_RENTORAR_100_1000	Luu...
A5_2080_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, it feels way different down here compared to\nupstairs. Guess my hunch about this place was right.
A5_2080_TIM_100_1000	Then we’d better be extra careful from here on out.
A5_2080_RENTORAR_200_1000	Luu...
A5_2080_PIKACHU_200_1000	Yeah, it feels way different down here compared to\nupstairs. Guess my hunch about this place was right.
A5_20800_PIKACHU_100_1000	We don’t need to go outside. Let’s keep investigating\nhere in the building.
A5_20800_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Understood.)
A5_20810_PIKACHU_100_1000	These are Tangela’s footprints.
A5_20810_PIKACHU_100_2000	Judging by the state of the dust, I’d say these were\nmade recently.
A5_20820_PIKACHU_100_1000	Someone left a note here.
A5_20820_PIKACHU_100_2000	It’s got instructions from the “management team.”
A5_20830_RENTORAR_100_1000	(This looks similar to the paper you were\nlooking at outside.)
A5_20830_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. It’s the same sort of paper, all right, but I don’t\nknow what it’s doing here.
A5_20840_PIKACHU_100_1000	This is a chemical stain.
A5_20840_PIKACHU_100_2000	I wouldn’t touch it. We don’t know what kind of\nchemical it is.
A5_20850_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Someone appears to have broken this machine.)
A5_20850_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah—and it looks deliberate too...
A5_20860_PIKACHU_100_1000	This is the cupboard where we found the key. I\nwonder if there’s anything else inside.
A5_20860_RENTORAR_100_1000	(There isn’t. Even I don’t see anything noteworthy\nin here.)
A5_20880_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Hey. There’s open space behind this wall.)
A5_20880_PIKACHU_100_1000	Bingo!
A5_20880_RENTORAR_100_2000	(Now you know where to go, but how exactly do you\nplan to get there?)
A5_20880_PIKACHU_100_2000	Break down the wall, of course.
A5_20880_PIKACHU_100_3000	This measly little wall doesn’t stand a chance against\nDarmanitan.
A5_20880_TIM_100_1000	Could you please smash that suspicious-looking wall\nover there?
A5_20880_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Darman!
A5_20880_PIKACHU_100_4000	Raring to go, huh? Let ’er rip, Darmanitan!
A5_2090_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro.
A5_2090_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m acting weird?
A5_2090_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hey, even I get nervous sometimes! We’re infiltrating\nthe enemy’s base, for cryin’ out loud!
A5_2090_GORONDA_100_2000	Goro...
A5_2090_GORONDA_200_1000	Goro.
A5_2090_PIKACHU_200_1000	I’m acting weird?
A5_2090_PIKACHU_200_2000	Hey, even I get nervous sometimes! We’re infiltrating\nthe enemy’s base, for cryin’ out loud!
A5_2100_TIM_100_1000	There should be some stairs behind this door, but I\ncan’t seem to get it open.
A5_2100_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s locked. Looks like it needs a passcode.
A5_21010_TIM_100_1000	Thanks for helping us out, Darmanitan.
A5_21010_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Darman!
A5_21020_RACHEL_100_1000	You’re going to break down that wall for us? Thanks,\nyou two.
A5_21020_RACHEL_100_2000	Just be careful, OK?
A5_21030_GARDIE_100_1000	(You can even break down walls? That’s so cool!)
A5_21030_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Yep! Smashing stuff is what I do best!)
A5_21035_GARDIE_100_1000	(You can even break down walls? That’s so cool!)
A5_21040_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Don’t break more than necessary, got it?)
A5_21040_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Got it! ...I think.)
A5_21045_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Don’t break more than necessary, got it?)
A5_21050_GORONDA_100_1000	(I’ll leave this to you.)
A5_21050_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(I’ll give it all I’ve got!)
A5_21055_GORONDA_100_1000	(I’ll leave this to you.)
A5_21060_PIKACHU_100_1000	We don’t need to go outside. Let’s keep investigating\nhere in the building.
A5_21070_PIKACHU_100_1000	These are Tangela’s footprints.
A5_21070_PIKACHU_100_2000	Judging by the state of the dust, I’d say these were\nmade recently.
A5_21080_PIKACHU_100_1000	Someone left a note here.
A5_21080_PIKACHU_100_2000	It’s got instructions from the “management team.”
A5_21090_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(There’s something on the floor.)
A5_21090_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, it’s a food wrapper. The people who’ve been\ncoming here must have dropped it.
A5_2110_TIM_100_1000	Looks like a terminal to input the passcode to access\nthe stairs.
A5_2110_PIKACHU_100_1000	Appears to be a four-digit passcode too...
A5_2110_TIM_200_1000	Looks like a terminal to input the passcode to access\nthe stairs.
A5_21100_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a chemical stain.
A5_21100_PIKACHU_100_2000	We probably shouldn’t touch it.
A5_21110_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(What’s this thing?)
A5_21110_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a switchboard, but I’m pretty sure it’s not\noperational right now.
A5_21115_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Should I smash this too?)
A5_21115_PIKACHU_100_1000	No, you don’t need to smash that. Just the wall.
A5_21120_PIKACHU_100_1000	This is the wall—think you can smash it?
A5_21120_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(I could smash it in my sleep! Just watch!)
A5_21125_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Need me to smash this door?)
A5_21125_PIKACHU_100_1000	No, you don’t need to smash everything! Just smash\nthe wall, please!
A5_21130_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(I smashed it good!)
A5_21130_PIKACHU_100_1000	Just like I knew you would! Thanks, Darmanitan.
A5_21130_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s all keep going.
A5_21130_TIM_100_1000	Wow... There was a whole hallway hidden behind\nthat wall.
A5_21130_PIKACHU_100_3000	And some stairs leading down, too.
A5_21130_PIKACHU_100_4000	Someone must’ve really wanted to keep this hidden.
A5_2115_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wait, Tim.
A5_2115_TIM_100_1000	What is it?
A5_2115_PIKACHU_100_2000	Look over there.
A5_2115_TIM_100_2000	Is that...?
A5_2115_PIKACHU_100_3000	Let’s hide and see what happens.
A5_21210_TIM_100_1000	Do you want to stop riding Luxray?
A5_21210_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_21210_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_21210_TIM_300_1000	Be careful getting down. I’ll lend you a hand.
A5_21210_PIKACHU_300_1000	You worry too much, Tim.
A5_21210_TIM_400_1000	Just let me know when you want to get down.
A5_21220_RACHEL_100_1000	You’re gonna look inside those rooms, right? Be\ncareful, you two.
A5_21220_PIKACHU_100_1000	Awww! Hear that? Rachel’s worried about us!
A5_21220_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Hmph... She doesn’t need to worry about me.)
A5_21230_RACHEL_100_1000	You’re gonna look inside those rooms, right? Be\ncareful, you two.
A5_21240_GARDIE_100_1000	(Anything I can do to help?)
A5_21240_PIKACHU_100_1000	I think we’re good for now.
A5_21240_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Just wait here—quietly.)
A5_21240_GARDIE_100_2000	(OK!)
A5_2125_RACHEL_100_1000	I heard people talking, so I came to see what’s\ngoing on.
A5_2125_PIKACHU_100_1000	Unitas is here, just like we thought.
A5_2125_TIM_100_1000	Our deductions were right on the money.
A5_2125_PIKACHU_100_2000	And did you hear what they just said, Tim?
A5_2125_TIM_100_2000	Yeah—something about the Aurora Drop and a\nproduction line.
A5_2125_PIKACHU_100_3000	Based on that broadcast we heard earlier, they gotta\nbe talking about producing the cubes.
A5_2125_RACHEL_100_2000	And Papa’s here to conduct an inspection...
A5_2125_PIKACHU_100_4000	The mayor might still be on floor B5. Let’s head down\nthere and see if we can catch him.
A5_2125_TIM_100_3000	Guess we’ll need to find a way to get downstairs.
A5_2125_PIKACHU_100_5000	We gotta be careful, though. There are still some\nUnitas goons on this floor.
A5_2125_PIKACHU_100_6000	They might have gone into one of the rooms around\nhere. We should keep our guards up if we decide to\nwalk into any of ’em.
A5_21250_GARDIE_100_1000	(Anything I can do to help?)
A5_21250_PIKACHU_100_1000	I think we’re good for now.
A5_21260_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(What are we doing next?)
A5_21260_PIKACHU_100_1000	Luxray’s gonna help us check inside those rooms.
A5_21260_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(Oh, I see! So should I break the doors down?)
A5_21260_RENTORAR_100_1000	(No...don’t do that. The whole point is that I’m going\nto look inside from out in the hall.)
A5_21270_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(What are we doing next?)
A5_21270_PIKACHU_100_1000	Luxray’s gonna help us check inside those rooms.
A5_21280_GORONDA_100_1000	(Should I just wait here?)
A5_21280_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, that’s fine.
A5_21280_PIKACHU_100_2000	Luxray’s gonna help look inside the rooms.
A5_21280_RENTORAR_100_1000	(If any enemies come, you and Darmanitan must\nface them.)
A5_21280_GORONDA_100_2000	(Sure thing.)
A5_21290_GORONDA_100_1000	(Should I just wait here?)
A5_21290_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, that’s fine.
A5_21290_RENTORAR_100_1000	(If any enemies come, you and Darmanitan must\nface them.)
A5_2130_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’re trying to get to floor B5, right? Let’s check out\nthe stairs or the elevator.
A5_21300_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Where are you going? We should be investigating\ndown here.)
A5_21300_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, you’re right.
A5_21310_PIKACHU_100_1000	I can’t get the elevator to move.
A5_21310_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Let’s find another way.)
A5_21315_RENTORAR_100_1000	(There are stairs on the other side of this door.)
A5_21315_PIKACHU_100_1000	Good to know, but we can’t get to ’em. We gotta find\nthe passcode first.
A5_21320_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ll need a passcode to open the door.
A5_21320_RENTORAR_100_1000	(The police station had something like this too.)
A5_21330_PIKACHU_100_1000	Lemme take another look at this map...
A5_21330_PIKACHU_100_2000	Looks like the stairs really are the only way down.
A5_21355_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Hey. Didn’t you want to look inside those rooms?)
A5_21355_PIKACHU_100_1000	Whoops, you’re right—no more rooms past here.
A5_21360_RENTORAR_100_1000	(There are two humans and an Electrode in the room.)
A5_21360_RENTORAR_100_2000	(It’s the same humans who were in the hallway\nearlier—the ones wearing white.)
A5_21360_PIKACHU_100_1000	How’s the Electrode look?
A5_21360_RENTORAR_100_3000	(Normal. It’s in the corner, looking bored.)
A5_21360_PIKACHU_100_2000	So you don’t think it was captured by Unitas?
A5_21360_PIKACHU_100_3000	At any rate, it sounds like we can’t go in that room to\ninvestigate.
A5_21360_RENTORAR_100_4000	(True. If you want to get inside, you’ll need a plan.)
A5_21370_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Pikachu!)
A5_21370_PIKACHU_100_1000	What is it, Luxray?
A5_21370_RENTORAR_100_2000	(There’s a Pokémon collapsed on the floor in there.)
A5_21370_PIKACHU_100_2000	What?! Tell me more—whatever you can see!
A5_21372_RENTORAR_100_1000	(The door appears to be locked.)
A5_21372_PIKACHU_100_1000	Then there’s only one way to get inside.
A5_21372_PIKACHU_100_2000	Where’s the duct in that room lead to, Luxray?
A5_21372_RENTORAR_100_2000	(I can’t tell from here—too many walls in the way.)
A5_21372_PIKACHU_100_3000	Oh...
A5_21372_PIKACHU_300_1000	Hmm... Well, I did see a duct somewhere else on this\nfloor. Wonder if I can get inside it.
A5_21372_PIKACHU_300_2000	Let’s go check it out, Luxray.
A5_21372_PIKACHU_400_1000	I wonder if there’s another duct somewhere that’s\nconnected to the one here.
A5_21372_PIKACHU_400_2000	Guess we’ll just have to search the rest of this floor.\nLet’s go. Luxray!
A5_21380_RENTORAR_100_1000	(I already told you what’s in this room.)
A5_21380_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, I know. Let’s look somewhere else.
A5_21390_RENTORAR_100_1000	(There’s a collapsed Wooper in this room.)
A5_21390_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve gotta do something to help...
A5_2140_TIM_100_1000	The elevator stopped at B5.
A5_2140_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, they did just say they were heading down there.
A5_2140_TIM_100_2000	I tried pushing the button, but it’s not working.
A5_2140_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’ll bet you need a card key.
A5_2140_TIM_100_3000	Then I sure hope we can find one somewhere...
A5_2140_TIM_200_1000	The elevator stopped on floor B5, and we can’t use it\nwithout a card key.
A5_21400_RENTORAR_100_1000	(What’s that say?)
A5_21400_PIKACHU_100_1000	Just some stuff about the cubes. We don’t gotta worry\nabout it right now.
A5_21410_PIKACHU_100_1000	We don’t have to worry about this notice right now.
A5_21410_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Very well.)
A5_21420_PIKACHU_100_1000	We don’t have to worry about this notice right now.
A5_21420_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Very well.)
A5_21427_RENTORAR_100_1000	(I can kind of see more clearly from here. This duct\nleads to the room next to us.)
A5_21427_PIKACHU_100_1000	I can probably use it to reach that Wooper, then.
A5_21430_PIKACHU_100_1000	We don’t need to check out the water cooler\nright now.
A5_21430_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Where do you want me to look?)
A5_21440_RENTORAR_100_1000	(What is your plan now?)
A5_21440_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s head back to Tim, for starters.
A5_21440_PIKACHU_100_2000	I wanna tell him about that Wooper that needs\nour help.
A5_21440_RENTORAR_100_2000	(Hold on tight.)
A5_21450_TIM_100_1000	Do you want to stop riding Luxray?
A5_21450_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_21450_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_21450_TIM_300_1000	Be careful getting down. I’ll lend you a hand.
A5_21450_PIKACHU_300_1000	You worry too much, Tim.
A5_21450_TIM_400_1000	Just let me know when you want to get down.
A5_2150_TIM_100_1000	This looks like a map of the facility.
A5_2150_PIKACHU_100_1000	Lucky us—the floors all have labels.
A5_2150_TIM_100_2000	Let’s see... Floor B1 is labeled “Management Team.”
A5_2150_TIM_100_3000	Floors B2 and B3 are labeled “Operations Team.”
A5_2150_TIM_100_4000	And “Research Team” covers floors B4 and B5.
A5_2150_PIKACHU_100_2000	Management, operations, and research...
A5_2150_PIKACHU_100_3000	Seems like Unitas is made up of three teams.
A5_2150_TIM_100_5000	There’s a map of this floor too.
A5_2150_PIKACHU_100_4000	Looks like we’re on B1, the floor used by the\nmanagement team.
A5_2150_TIM_100_6000	The map says there are two rooms on this floor.
A5_2150_PIKACHU_100_5000	And if we wanna get down, we could either use the\nelevator or take the stairs...
A5_2150_TIM_100_7000	As long as we can get there without being seen.
A5_2150_PIKACHU_100_6000	Well...for now, let’s investigate.
A5_2150_TIM_200_1000	It’s a map of the facility.
A5_2150_PIKACHU_200_1000	Seems like Unitas is made up of three teams.
A5_2160_PIKACHU_100_1000	We wanna access the lower floors, but we can’t use\nthe elevator.
A5_2160_TIM_100_1000	The stairs will work—but we need a passcode, right?
A5_2160_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, a four-digit number.
A5_2160_TIM_100_2000	Let’s search this floor top to bottom for that\npasscode, then.
A5_2160_PIKACHU_100_3000	Good idea. Someone might’ve written it down\nsomewhere.
A5_2160_PIKACHU_100_4000	We gotta keep our eyes peeled for Unitas, though.\nIf we get caught, this case is as good as closed.
A5_2160_TIM_100_3000	Right. I’ll be careful.
A5_21610_PIKACHU_100_1000	Nice! Now there’s a clear way through.\nMuch obliged, Pangoro!
A5_21610_GORONDA_100_1000	(No problem.)
A5_21610_PIKACHU_100_2000	There should be another big room past here. Let’s go\nget Tim and the others.
A5_2170_TIM_100_1000	...I can’t make out what they’re saying, but I can hear\nvoices on the other side of this door.
A5_2170_PIKACHU_100_1000	Probably the same guys from before. Guess we’re not\ninvestigating this room.
A5_2180_PIKACHU_100_1000	We can’t go in here.
A5_2190_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wait, did you hear a sound coming from that room\njust now? What do you think it was?
A5_2190_TIM_100_1000	I don’t know. And as much as I’d like to find out, we\ncan’t just go barging blindly into rooms if we want to\navoid Unitas.
A5_2190_PIKACHU_100_2000	Rrgh... This is so frustrating.
A5_21905_SECRETDORYUZU_100_1000	Driiill!
A5_21905_PIKACHU_100_1000	Whoa! Excadrill’s still on a rampage!
A5_21905_RENTORAR_100_1000	(I’ll take a look into the room.)
A5_21920_RENTORAR_100_1000	(The rampaging Excadrill has a cube-shaped device\nattached to its back.)
A5_21920_RENTORAR_100_2000	(It appears to be the same as the ones they put on us\nat the police station.)
A5_21920_PIKACHU_100_1000	So that’s what’s going on. Poor Excadrill... I feel for\nya, buddy.
A5_21920_RENTORAR_100_3000	(Are you saying that humans are forcing Excadrill to\nact this way?)
A5_21920_PIKACHU_100_2000	No. Cramorant swallowed the controller.
A5_21920_PIKACHU_100_3000	So at this point, Excadrill’s completely out of control.
A5_21920_RENTORAR_100_4000	(That truly is a frightening device.)
A5_21920_PIKACHU_100_4000	I wonder if it’ll settle down if we can get the cube off\nits back...
A5_21920_DORYUZU_100_1000	Driiill!
A5_21920_PIKACHU_100_5000	Uhhh... Maybe we should keep our distance, actually.
A5_21920_PIKACHU_100_6000	For now, let’s look for Cramorant.
A5_21940_TIM_100_1000	Did you find Cramorant?
A5_21940_PIKACHU_100_1000	Not yet, but we’re working on it!
A5_21950_RACHEL_100_1000	I hope you find Cramorant!
A5_21950_PIKACHU_100_1000	We will—just leave it to us!
A5_21960_GARDIE_100_1000	(Be careful the humans don’t see you!)
A5_21960_PIKACHU_100_1000	We will. You got that, Luxray?
A5_21960_RENTORAR_100_1000	(You don’t need to warn me—I’ve come this far,\nhaven’t I?)
A5_21970_GARDIE_100_1000	(Be careful the humans don’t see you!)
A5_21980_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(You want us to wait here quietly? NO PROBLEM!)
A5_21980_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Stop shouting, Darmanitan.)
A5_21980_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah... Dial back the enthusiasm and use your\ninside voice.
A5_21990_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(We’ll be waiting real quietly right here! Go get ’em!)
A5_2200_TIM_100_1000	There’s a water cooler here.
A5_2200_PIKACHU_100_1000	The ol’ Unitas watering hole, eh? Even bad guys gotta\nwet their whistles, I suppose.
A5_2200_TIM_100_2000	Then we’d better not hang around for long. Someone\nis bound to stop by sooner or later.
A5_22000_GORONDA_100_1000	(Any way I can help find Cramorant?)
A5_22000_PIKACHU_100_1000	I appreciate the thought, but Cramorant might run\naway if it sees you.
A5_22000_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Leave this one to us, Pangoro.)
A5_22010_GORONDA_100_1000	(So I should just wait here? OK.)
A5_22020_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Where are we going? Is Cramorant on one of the\nupper floors?)
A5_22020_PIKACHU_100_1000	No... Based on what we heard, it sounds like\nCramorant might be on this floor.
A5_22020_RENTORAR_100_2000	(Then there’s no need for us to go upstairs.)
A5_22030_PIKACHU_100_1000	Excadrill’s rampaging on the other side of this door...
A5_22030_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Careful not to get too close.)
A5_22040_PIKACHU_100_1000	Surprise, surprise. The elevator’s stopped at floor B5.
A5_22040_RENTORAR_100_1000	(But Cramorant’s on this floor, isn’t he? Investigating\nhere should come first.)
A5_22045_RENTORAR_100_1000	(We can’t use these stairs now.)
A5_22045_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, we gotta find the passcode first.
A5_22050_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like we need a passcode to use these stairs.
A5_22050_PIKACHU_100_2000	Too bad they just changed the numbers. There’s gotta\nbe something we can do...
A5_22060_PIKACHU_100_1000	To get down to the next floor, we either need to use\nthe elevator or the stairs...
A5_22060_RENTORAR_100_1000	(But first we’re searching for Cramorant on this floor,\naren’t we? Discussing our next steps can wait.)
A5_22075_PIKACHU_100_1000	Chase that Cramorant!
A5_22075_RENTORAR_100_1000	(I will, but there’s also a human in this storeroom.)
A5_22075_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’d better keep an eye on that person’s movements\nso we can maneuver around ’em.
A5_22075_PIKACHU_100_3000	Lucky for us, Cramorant seems to have scattered\nfeathers behind him as he ran.
A5_22075_PIKACHU_100_4000	If we follow those, we should be able to find him!
A5_22075_PIKACHU_100_5000	Try to get us through there without being spotted by\nthe human, Luxray!
A5_22075_RENTORAR_100_2000	(Hmph. Just watch.)
A5_22090_RENTORAR_100_1000	(How could I mess up so badly?)
A5_22090_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s try again—and this time? Don’t get caught.
A5_22095_RENTORAR_100_1000	(I see Cramorant in a box.)
A5_22095_PIKACHU_100_1000	Really? Which box?
A5_2210_TIM_100_1000	“Inspections occur nightly to ensure that the cubes\nare operating properly.
A5_2210_TIM_100_2000	“Maintenance staff will be checking each room for\nany abnormalities. Thank you for your cooperation.”
A5_2210_TIM_100_3000	According to this, <color=#F39800FF>the maintenance staff will be going\nin and out of the rooms at night</color>...
A5_2210_PIKACHU_100_1000	And they gotta run these checks seven nights a week?\nSounds like a real grind.
A5_2210_TIM_200_1000	“Inspections occur nightly to ensure that the cubes\nare operating properly.
A5_2210_TIM_200_2000	“Maintenance staff will be checking each room for\nany abnormalities. Thank you for your cooperation.”
A5_2210_TIM_200_3000	According to this, the maintenance staff will be going\nin and out of the rooms at night...
A5_22110_PIKACHU_100_1000	Now that we’ve found Cramorant, let’s head back\nto Tim.
A5_22110_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Right. And that device?)
A5_22110_PIKACHU_100_2000	It’s a cube controller. We can use it to stop Excadrill.
A5_22110_RENTORAR_100_2000	(Good. It pains me to see Pokémon being controlled.)
A5_22110_UU_100_1000	(Heeey, so, how’re we, like, gonna get outta here?)
A5_22110_PIKACHU_100_3000	Just stick with us, Cramorant. We’ll keep you away\nfrom Unitas.
A5_22110_UU_100_2000	(Whoaaa, you’re gonna, like, escort me outta this\nbuilding? Thanks, dude!)
A5_22110_RENTORAR_100_3000	(Aren’t we trying to get to B5, Pikachu? I’m not sure\nCramorant understands that.)
A5_22110_PIKACHU_100_4000	Eh, we’ll figure something out.
A5_2220_TIM_100_1000	“The passcode to access the stairs is updated monthly.
A5_2220_TIM_100_2000	“The passcode is available in the standby room.”
A5_2220_PIKACHU_100_1000	Aha! <color=#F39800FF>We can find the passcode in the standby room!</color>\nNow there’s a handy piece of intel!
A5_2220_TIM_100_3000	Yeah, but there are two rooms on this floor. Which do\nyou think is the standby room?
A5_2220_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hmm... Quickest way to find out is to check both.
A5_2220_TIM_200_1000	“The passcode to access the stairs is updated monthly.
A5_2220_TIM_200_2000	“The passcode is available in the standby room.”
A5_2220_PIKACHU_400_1000	Just to be sure, let’s look at the other notices too.
A5_22210_TIM_100_1000	Do you think Growlithe’s OK?
A5_22210_PIKACHU_100_1000	Listen, Tim. I’m just as worried as you are, but we\ndo NOT have time for that right now.
A5_22210_PIKACHU_100_2000	You know what’s at stake here, don’t you?
A5_22210_TIM_100_2000	Yeah... Let’s hurry—for Growlithe’s sake too!
A5_22220_TIM_100_1000	Growlithe...
A5_22220_PIKACHU_100_1000	I know you’re worried, Tim, but we gotta keep going.
A5_22230_RACHEL_100_1000	I’m so sorry, Growlithe...
A5_22230_RACHEL_100_2000	I swear we’ll come back for you!
A5_22240_RACHEL_100_1000	I’m so sorry, Growlithe...
A5_22250_RENTORAR_100_1000	(That Growlithe is brave beyond her years. She\nreacted even faster than I could!)
A5_22250_RENTORAR_100_2000	(Let’s hurry, Pikachu. We can’t let her valiant stand be\nfor nothing!)
A5_22250_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah!
A5_22260_RENTORAR_100_1000	(That Growlithe...)
A5_22260_RENTORAR_100_2000	(I thought she was just a little pup. It seems I\nunderestimated her.)
A5_22270_GORONDA_100_1000	(If we don’t hurry, the time she bought us will have\nbeen for nothing.)
A5_22270_GORONDA_100_2000	(Let’s keep moving.)
A5_22280_GORONDA_100_1000	(Don’t waste the time she bought us. Let’s keep\ngoing.)
A5_22290_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m worried about Growlithe...but right now we need\nto keep moving!
A5_2230_TIM_100_1000	“Security protocols have been updated due to\ninstances of Pokémon escaping captivity.
A5_2230_TIM_100_2000	“To prevent further incidents, pay close attention to\neach Pokémon’s behavior.
A5_2230_TIM_100_3000	“In the event that a Pokémon escapes, immediately\nnotify all on-site personnel via intercom.
A5_2230_TIM_100_4000	“Escaped Pokémon are to be recaptured any means\nnecessary.”
A5_2230_PIKACHU_100_1000	They’re keeping Pokémon captive here?
A5_2230_TIM_100_5000	Sure seems that way. <color=#F39800FF>This notice is warning people\nnot to let any Pokémon escape.</color>
A5_2230_PIKACHU_100_2000	And past escape attempts have put ’em on high alert.\nAs if this wasn’t already challenging enough...
A5_2230_TIM_200_1000	“Security protocols have been updated due to\ninstances of Pokémon escaping captivity.
A5_2230_TIM_200_2000	“To prevent further incidents, pay close attention to\neach Pokémon’s behavior.

A5_2230_TIM_200_4000	“Escaped Pokémon are to be recaptured any means\nnecessary.”
A5_22300_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, we made it through!
A5_22300_PIKACHU_100_2000	We should reach the elevator if we keep going\nstraight this way!
A5_22301_TIM_100_1000	There’s an elevator down this way, right?
A5_22301_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, there should be! C’mon, let’s hurry!
A5_22302_TIM_100_1000	Let’s hurry to the elevator!
A5_22303_RACHEL_100_1000	Thank you, Darmanitan! We couldn’t have made it\nthis far without your strength!
A5_22303_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(She’s saying something nice about me, right?)
A5_22303_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah—but don’t let it go to your head!
A5_22304_RACHEL_100_1000	We couldn’t have made it this far without your\nstrength, Darmanitan.
A5_22305_RENTORAR_100_1000	(I see your endurance is as impressive as your\nstrength, Darmanitan. You don’t even seem tired.)
A5_22305_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(This is what I do best, so I’m not holdin’ anything\nback!)
A5_22305_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thank you, Darmanitan.
A5_22306_RENTORAR_100_1000	(Your strength is truly impressive, Darmanitan.)
A5_22307_GORONDA_100_1000	(Those are some solid haymakers you’re throwing,\nDarmanitan. Really powerful stuff.)
A5_22307_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Thanks! I’m happy you like them!)
A5_22307_GORONDA_100_2000	(Watching you is making me eager to let loose and\nshow what I can do!)
A5_22308_GORONDA_100_1000	(Those were some solid haymakers, Darmanitan.)
A5_22310_RACHEL_100_1000	This door won’t open!
A5_22310_RENTORAR_100_1000	(We’re running out of time—I can see those humans\ngetting closer.)
A5_22310_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Even I can’t break a door like this!)
A5_22310_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s GOTTA be a way to open this door, right?!
A5_22310_TIM_100_1000	Pikachu! What about that switchboard?
A5_22310_PIKACHU_100_2000	Aha! We can probably force the door open if we run\nan electric current through this switchboard!
A5_22310_RENTORAR_100_2000	(I guess that’s my cue.)
A5_22310_PIKACHU_100_3000	Huh?
A5_22330_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’m sorry, Luxray!
A5_22330_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Let’s go, Pikachu!)
A5_22330_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah. We’ll come back for him and Growlithe when\nthis is all over!
A5_22330_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hang on until then, you two!
A5_22340_TIM_100_1000	Luxray...
A5_22340_TIM_100_2000	No, I need to stay focused. Now’s not the time to feel\ndown—we’ve got to keep moving!
A5_2235_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s a ventilation duct.
A5_2235_TIM_100_1000	You might be able to squeeze through it, Pikachu.
A5_2235_PIKACHU_100_2000	You’re dredging up painful memories of the police\nstation...and the ruins...
A5_2235_PIKACHU_100_3000	I guess I could go through there to gather info...as a\nlast resort. We’ll keep it in mind, at least.
A5_2235_TIM_100_2000	Are you sure you’ll fit? You wouldn’t want to get stuck\nin there!
A5_2235_PIKACHU_100_4000	Don’t sweat it. All our running around these past few\ndays has got me nice and limbered up!
A5_2235_PIKACHU_100_5000	But I dunno if I wanna crawl through right at this\nvery moment.
A5_2235_TIM_100_3000	Fair enough. We don’t even know where it leads yet.
A5_22350_TIM_100_1000	Now’s not the time to feel down—we’ve got to keep\nmoving!
A5_22360_RACHEL_100_1000	Growlithe and Luxray stayed behind so we could\nkeep going...
A5_22360_PIKACHU_100_1000	Rachel...
A5_22360_RACHEL_100_2000	Thanks for worrying about me. This is really tough,\nbut I know we have to stay the course.
A5_22370_RACHEL_100_1000	Growlithe, Luxray... Please be OK.
A5_22380_GORONDA_100_1000	(I’m sure Luxray will be fine.)
A5_22380_GORONDA_100_2000	(You know firsthand just how powerful his\nElectric-type moves are.)
A5_22380_PIKACHU_100_1000	You got that right. Let’s trust Luxray to take care\nof himself.
A5_22390_GORONDA_100_1000	(I’m sure Luxray will be fine.)
A5_22390_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah...
A5_2240_PIKACHU_100_1000	We can find the passcode to the stairway in the\nstandby room.
A5_2240_TIM_100_1000	But there might be Unitas members in there, right?
A5_2240_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, we can’t just go waltzing into a room without\nseeing what’s inside first.
A5_2240_PIKACHU_100_3000	Which means we need a hand from...
A5_2240_TIM_100_2000	Luxray!
A5_2240_PIKACHU_100_4000	Glad we’re on the same page. Let’s go ask Luxray\nfor help!
A5_22400_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve gotta keep moving forward—for Luxray and\nGrowlithe’s sake too!
A5_22410_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK. At this point, all that’s left is to take the elevator\ndown to the bottom floor.
A5_22410_PIKACHU_100_2000	It’s thanks to you that we made it this far, Darmanitan.\nWe really appreciate it.
A5_22410_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(No, thank YOU!)
A5_22410_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	(It felt awesome getting to help out so much.)
A5_22410_GORONDA_100_1000	(I wanna thank you, too, for giving me a chance to\nrepay my debt to you.)
A5_22410_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hey, cut it out. You’re acting like this is goodbye.
A5_22410_PIKACHU_100_4000	We’ve still got the bottom floor to deal with—and for\nall we know, that’ll be where things REALLY get hairy.
A5_22410_GHIHIDARUMA_100_3000	(R-right.)
A5_22410_GORONDA_100_2000	(True.)
A5_22410_PIKACHU_100_5000	OK, everyone—into the elevator we go!
A5_2250_TIM_100_1000	Luxray, you’d be able to see what’s beyond those\nwalls, right?
A5_2250_RENTORAR_100_1000	Ray.
A5_2250_TIM_100_2000	Should we get some help from Luxray now?
A5_2250_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_2250_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_2250_PIKACHU_300_1000	All right. Let’s do this, Luxray!
A5_2250_RENTORAR_300_1000	Lux.
A5_2250_PIKACHU_400_1000	Sorry, gimme a moment to think.
A5_2250_RENTORAR_400_1000	Ray.
A5_2260_RACHEL_100_1000	Did you find something?
A5_2260_TIM_100_1000	Well, we did learn that the passcode to the stairs is\navailable in the standby room.
A5_2260_RACHEL_100_2000	Really?!
A5_2260_TIM_100_2000	But there might be Unitas members inside, so we’re\ngonna ask Luxray to check.
A5_2260_RACHEL_100_3000	He’s gonna look through the walls for you, right?\nBe careful not to get caught!
A5_2260_RACHEL_200_1000	Be careful not to get caught!
A5_2270_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow...
A5_2270_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’re worried about the Cramorant those people\nwere talking about?
A5_2270_GARDIE_100_2000	Gow.
A5_2270_TIM_100_1000	If it’s the Cramorant we know, I’d like to help get him\nhome again.
A5_2270_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, me too.
A5_2270_GARDIE_200_1000	Gow...
A5_2270_PIKACHU_200_1000	You’re worried about the Cramorant those people\nwere talking about?
A5_2280_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Darmaaa!
A5_2280_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, I’m sure those are bad guys, too—but it’s still\ntoo dangerous to go charging in.
A5_2280_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’ve gotta gather more info before we can plan our\nnext step.
A5_2280_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Dar.
A5_2280_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Darmaaa!
A5_2280_PIKACHU_200_1000	Yeah, I’m sure those are bad guys, too—but it’s still\ntoo dangerous to go charging in.
A5_2290_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro...
A5_2290_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’re wondering what those people we saw earlier\nwere up to?
A5_2290_TIM_100_1000	We’re not quite sure ourselves—but whatever it was,\nit can’t have been good.
A5_2290_GORONDA_100_2000	Goro...
A5_2290_GORONDA_200_1000	Goro...
A5_2290_PIKACHU_200_1000	You’re wondering what those people we saw earlier\nwere up to?
A5_2290_TIM_200_1000	Whatever it was, it can’t have been good.
A5_2310_PIKACHU_100_1000	Tim! I’ve gotta tell ya something!
A5_2310_TIM_100_1000	Keep it down, Pikachu. Someone might hear you.
A5_2310_PIKACHU_100_2000	Ah, right... I’ll tell you quietly, then.
A5_2310_PIKACHU_100_3000	There are some Unitas guys and an Electrode in the\nfirst room down the hall.
A5_2310_TIM_100_2000	Which means we can’t go in there.
A5_2310_PIKACHU_100_4000	As for the second room, there aren’t any Unitas guys,\nbut...
A5_2310_TIM_100_3000	But what?
A5_2310_PIKACHU_100_5000	A Wooper’s collapsed on the floor in there. I’m\nworried about its condition, shut away like that.
A5_2310_TIM_100_4000	That’s awful! Is there anything we can do to help it?!
A5_2310_PIKACHU_100_6000	Shhh! Now look who needs to turn down the volume...\nI feel the same way as you, Tim—we’ve gotta help it.
A5_2310_PIKACHU_100_7000	Looks like a duct on the far side of this floor leads\ninto that room.
A5_2310_PIKACHU_100_8000	I oughta be able to squeeze through—especially if it’s\nfor a rescue mission!
A5_2310_TIM_100_5000	Sounds good. Let’s go.
A5_2320_RACHEL_100_1000	A weakened Wooper has been locked in a room\nby itself?!
A5_2320_RACHEL_100_2000	We need to go help it right away—but how do we get\ninto the room?!
A5_2320_TIM_100_1000	Don’t worry, Rachel.
A5_2320_TIM_100_2000	We’re pretty sure Pikachu can get in through a duct at\nthe end of the hall.
A5_2320_RACHEL_200_1000	We need to hurry and rescue that Wooper!
A5_2320_TIM_200_1000	Don’t worry. We’ve figured out a way into the room.
A5_2330_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow...
A5_2330_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, no need to look so worried!
A5_2330_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’ll be fine on my own. It’s just a little duct trip!
A5_2330_GARDIE_200_1000	Gow.
A5_2330_PIKACHU_200_1000	Thanks for looking out for me.
A5_2340_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar.
A5_2340_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’re amazed I can fit inside such a narrow duct?
A5_2340_PIKACHU_100_2000	Well, my friend, you’re looking at the ideal physique\nfor crawling into compact spaces!
A5_2340_TIM_100_1000	C’mon, Pikachu! You can brag all you want AFTER\nwe’ve saved that Wooper!
A5_2340_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Dar.
A5_2340_PIKACHU_200_1000	Like I said, you’re looking at the ideal physique for\ncrawling into compact spaces!
A5_2350_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux.
A5_2350_PIKACHU_100_1000	You bet—I got plenty of experience crawling through\nducts back at the police station.
A5_2350_PIKACHU_100_2000	Say, these ducts don’t also happen to lead downstairs,\ndo they?
A5_2350_RENTORAR_100_2000	...Lux.
A5_2350_PIKACHU_100_3000	Darn. Well, it was worth a shot.
A5_2350_RENTORAR_200_1000	Lux.
A5_2350_PIKACHU_200_1000	You bet—I got plenty of experience crawling through\nducts back at the police station.
A5_2360_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro...
A5_2360_PIKACHU_100_1000	Just leave it to me—I’m the only one who can fit\nthrough the duct.
A5_2360_PIKACHU_100_2000	I may have you and the others backing me up, but\nthat’s no reason for us to do anything reckless!
A5_2360_GORONDA_100_2000	Goro.
A5_2360_GORONDA_200_1000	Goro...
A5_2360_PIKACHU_200_1000	Just leave it to me—I’m the only one who can fit\nthrough the duct.
A5_2365_TIM_100_1000	The door’s locked. We need to find another way in.
A5_2370_PIKACHU_100_1000	I oughta be able to reach the room Wooper’s in\nfrom here.
A5_2370_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’ll go check on it, so just sit tight.
A5_2370_TIM_100_1000	Got it. Here, let me help you get into the duct.
A5_2370_PIKACHU_100_3000	Thanks, Tim.
A5_2381_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, I’m in.
A5_2381_PIKACHU_100_2000	Now I just need to help that weakened Wooper\nLuxray told me about.
A5_2385_PIKACHU_100_1000	Whoops! I gotta help the weakened Wooper first.
A5_2400_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey! You OK?! What happened to you?
A5_2400_UPAH_100_1000	W-woo...puh...
A5_2400_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh man, it’s in bad shape. I need to unlock the door\nso I can call Tim and the others.
A5_2400_UPAH_200_1000	W-woo...puh...
A5_2400_PIKACHU_200_1000	It’s in bad shape. I need to unlock the door so I can\ncall Tim and the others.
A5_2410_PIKACHU_100_1000	I don’t have time to investigate this right now.
A5_2430_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yes! I can open the door from inside.
A5_2430_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hey, Tim! Rachel! Get in here!
A5_2430_TIM_100_1000	Is Wooper OK?
A5_2430_PIKACHU_100_3000	It’s in pretty bad shape.
A5_2430_RACHEL_100_1000	Poor thing!
A5_2430_TIM_100_2000	What could have made it collapse like this?
A5_2430_RACHEL_100_2000	It must need water. See? Wooper’s whole body is\ndried up!
A5_2430_RACHEL_100_3000	We need to get it some water, ASAP!
A5_2430_TIM_100_3000	I’m pretty sure there’s water on this floor.
A5_2430_PIKACHU_100_4000	Yeah, let’s go get some for Wooper!
A5_2440_RACHEL_100_1000	There’s got to be water around here somewhere!\nWe need to hurry and get some to Wooper!
A5_2440_TIM_100_1000	I’m on it!
A5_2440_RACHEL_200_1000	There’s got to be water around here somewhere!\nWe need to hurry and get some to Wooper!
A5_2450_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow gow!
A5_2450_PIKACHU_100_1000	Don’t worry. We’ll make sure Wooper’s OK.
A5_2450_PIKACHU_100_2000	Your job is to stay here and stand guard—someone\nneeds to keep those bad guys off our tails.
A5_2450_GARDIE_100_2000	Gow!
A5_2450_GARDIE_200_1000	Gow gow!
A5_2450_PIKACHU_200_1000	Don’t worry. We’ll make sure Wooper’s OK.
A5_2460_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Darma?
A5_2460_PIKACHU_100_1000	We found a Wooper collapsed on the floor. It looks\nlike it needs water.
A5_2460_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Dar! Darma!
A5_2460_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah. We gotta hurry and find some water to help it...
A5_2460_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Dar! Darma!
A5_2460_PIKACHU_200_1000	Yeah. We gotta hurry and find some water to help it...
A5_2470_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux?
A5_2470_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s asking if you know where to get some water.
A5_2470_TIM_100_1000	I’m sure I saw water somewhere on this floor. We’ll go\nfind it.
A5_2470_RENTORAR_100_2000	Ray...
A5_2470_RENTORAR_200_1000	Lux?
A5_2470_PIKACHU_200_1000	He’s asking if you know where to get some water.
A5_2470_TIM_200_1000	I’m pretty sure I saw some on this floor.
A5_2480_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro.
A5_2480_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says to stop chatting and go rescue Wooper.
A5_2480_TIM_100_1000	Right. We should hurry and find some water.
A5_2480_GORONDA_200_1000	Goro.
A5_2480_PIKACHU_200_1000	He says to stop chatting and go rescue Wooper.
A5_2490_UPAH_100_1000	Woo...per...
A5_2490_PIKACHU_100_1000	C’mon, Tim! We gotta hurry and get it some water!
A5_2500_TIM_100_1000	No time to investigate—we’ve got to save Wooper!
A5_2510_TIM_100_1000	No time to investigate—we’ve got to save Wooper!
A5_2520_TIM_100_1000	No time to investigate—we’ve got to save Wooper!
A5_2530_PIKACHU_100_1000	This water should perk Wooper right up!
A5_2530_TIM_100_1000	Let’s bring it some right away!
A5_2540_UPAH_100_1000	Woop! Wooper!
A5_2540_TIM_100_1000	Oh, good. It looks so much better!
A5_2540_PIKACHU_100_1000	It says thank you.
A5_2540_UPAH_100_2000	Wooper!
A5_2540_RACHEL_100_1000	Thank goodness it’s OK...
A5_2540_TIM_100_2000	What’s this Wooper doing here, anyway?
A5_2540_PIKACHU_100_2000	Good question! Let’s ask.
A5_2550_PIKACHU_100_1000	Mind if we ask you a few questions, Wooper?
A5_2550_UPAH_100_1000	Woop.
A5_2550_PIKACHU_200_1000	Mind if we ask you a few questions, Wooper?
A5_2550_UPAH_200_1000	Wooper!
A5_2550_SEL_0_1000	About you, Wooper...
A5_2550_SEL_0_2000	Why are you here?
A5_2550_PIKACHU_300_1000	Your skin looks all damp and healthy again. That’s\ngreat to see.
A5_2550_UPAH_300_1000	Wooper.
A5_2550_TIM_300_1000	Huh. The air actually feels a little cooler next to\nWooper.
A5_2550_RACHEL_300_1000	Thanks to its Damp Ability, Wooper can make the air\naround itself more humid.
A5_2550_TIM_300_2000	Interesting! It actually feels pretty refreshing.
A5_2550_UPAH_300_2000	Wooper!
A5_2550_TIM_400_1000	What were you doing here in the first place, Wooper?
A5_2550_UPAH_400_1000	Wooper! Woopwoop!
A5_2550_PIKACHU_400_1000	Some humans captured it and brought it here against\nits will.
A5_2550_TIM_400_2000	Just like Darmanitan and his friends...
A5_2550_PIKACHU_400_2000	What a horrible thing to do.
A5_2550_UPAH_400_2000	Wooper...
A5_2550_PIKACHU_400_3000	And they wouldn’t give it any water, either, so it got\nweaker and weaker over time.
A5_2550_TIM_400_3000	Wooper usually live in water. The sudden change in\nenvironment must’ve been tough for it.
A5_2550_TIM_400_4000	Do you know anything about Unitas, Wooper?
A5_2550_UPAH_400_3000	Wooper...?
A5_2550_PIKACHU_400_4000	Wooper says something was put on its back—after\nthat, its mind went blank.
A5_2550_PIKACHU_400_5000	That’d explain why it doesn’t know anything about\nUnitas.
A5_2550_TIM_400_5000	I’m sure that “something” was a cube.
A5_2550_TIM_400_6000	Unitas must have been conducting experiments on\nthis poor Pokémon.
A5_2555_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wooper seems OK now, so we should get back to\nwhat we were doing.
A5_2555_TIM_100_1000	Right. We need to find the passcode to get\ndownstairs.
A5_2555_PIKACHU_100_2000	It might even be in this room, so we should\nlook around.
A5_2555_PIKACHU_100_3000	Why don’t we try that desk first? It might have info\nwe can use.
A5_2555_TIM_100_2000	Sounds good.
A5_2560_RACHEL_100_1000	I’m so glad Wooper’s recovered!
A5_2560_RACHEL_100_2000	This is just one more reason we need to hurry and get\ndown to the lowest floor—we can’t let them get away\nwith this!
A5_2560_TIM_100_1000	Yeah. We’re trying to find a way down there\nright now.
A5_2560_RACHEL_100_3000	Just let me know if there’s anything I can do.
A5_2560_RACHEL_100_4000	I’ll help however I can!
A5_2560_RACHEL_200_1000	Just let me know if there’s anything I can do.
A5_2560_RACHEL_200_2000	I’ll help however I can!
A5_2570_GARDIE_100_1000	Gowww!
A5_2570_PIKACHU_100_1000	She says it’s hard to believe anyone would be cruel\nenough to lock up a Pokémon and weaken it like that.
A5_2570_TIM_100_1000	I can hardly believe it, either.
A5_2570_TIM_100_2000	No matter what their reasons may be, we’ve got to\nstop them.
A5_2570_GARDIE_200_1000	Gowww!
A5_2570_PIKACHU_200_1000	She says it’s hard to believe anyone would be cruel\nenough to lock up a Pokémon and weaken it like that.
A5_2580_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Darmaaa!
A5_2580_TIM_100_1000	Whoa, what are you so mad about?
A5_2580_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Dar! Darma!
A5_2580_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s upset at how badly they treated Wooper.
A5_2580_TIM_100_2000	I understand completely—I’m mad at them too.
A5_2580_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Dar! Darma!
A5_2580_PIKACHU_200_1000	He’s upset at how badly they treated Wooper.
A5_2590_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux.
A5_2590_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says we can take our time exploring the room now.
A5_2590_TIM_100_1000	Great. I hope we find the stairs passcode soon...
A5_2590_RENTORAR_200_1000	Lux.
A5_2590_PIKACHU_200_1000	He says we can take our time exploring the room now.
A5_2600_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro?
A5_2600_PIKACHU_100_1000	He wants to know if we should bring Wooper along\nwith us.
A5_2600_TIM_100_1000	I feel bad just leaving it here, but I’m worried we’d be\nputting it in even more danger by bringing it with us...
A5_2600_PIKACHU_100_2000	When you’re right, you’re right. Let’s have it lay low\nback in that room so it doesn’t get found by Unitas.
A5_2600_GORONDA_100_2000	Goro.
A5_2600_GORONDA_200_1000	Gorohhh!
A5_2600_PIKACHU_200_1000	He’s saying he’ll fight off any Unitas people who\ncome near...
A5_2600_TIM_200_1000	Let’s move quietly and hope it doesn’t come to that.
A5_2610_TIM_100_1000	There’s an intercom here.
A5_2610_PIKACHU_100_1000	It looks like <color=#F39800FF>we can use the intercom to broadcast to\nother rooms in the facility</color>.
A5_2610_TIM_100_2000	Do you think we might be able to use this?
A5_2610_PIKACHU_200_1000	That intercom can broadcast to other rooms in the\nfacility.
A5_2620_TIM_100_1000	There’s a notice on the wall.
A5_2620_TIM_100_2000	“In the event of a fire or other emergency, an alarm\nwill sound throughout the entire facility.
A5_2620_TIM_100_3000	<color=#F39800FF>“If you hear the alarm, please evacuate immediately.</color><color=#F39800FF>”</color>
A5_2620_PIKACHU_100_1000	As sketchy as this organization is, I’m glad they’ve at\nleast got a disaster preparedness plan.
A5_2620_TIM_200_1000	“In the event of a fire or other emergency, an alarm\nwill sound throughout the entire facility.
A5_2620_TIM_200_2000	“If you hear the alarm, please evacuate immediately.”
A5_2640_TIM_100_1000	Whoa, look at this...
A5_2640_PIKACHU_100_1000	What is it, Tim?
A5_2640_TIM_100_2000	<color=#F39800FF>A photo of the Aurora Drop.</color>
A5_2640_PIKACHU_100_2000	They were talking about the Aurora Drop earlier,\nweren’t they?
A5_2640_TIM_100_3000	What’s this all about?
A5_2640_PIKACHU_100_3000	There might be some valuable info on this desk.
A5_2640_PIKACHU_200_1000	There might be something we forgot to check...
A5_2650_PIKACHU_100_1000	What should we look at first?
A5_2650_PIKACHU_200_1000	Is there anything you’re still curious about?
A5_2660_PIKACHU_5000_1000	Hey, wait, Tim.
A5_2660_PIKACHU_5000_2000	Don’t you think you oughta look around a bit more?
A5_2670_PIKACHU_100_1000	This desk reminds me of all the times your mom\nwould get annoyed with me.
A5_2670_PIKACHU_100_2000	She used to say it took a lot of talent to clutter up a\nroom the way I did!
A5_2680_TIM_100_1000	Hmm. What’s this folder?
A5_2680_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s see... It’s labeled “<color=#F39800FF>Business Plan</color>.”
A5_2680_TIM_100_2000	Hey, look at this page—these budget numbers are\nenormous!
A5_2680_PIKACHU_100_2000	Wow. That’s a lot of zeros. I wonder where this\norganization gets its funding...
A5_2680_TIM_100_3000	I’m not sure we can figure that out from this\ndocument alone.
A5_2690_TIM_100_1000	It’s a <color=#F39800FF>photo of Sableye</color>.
A5_2690_PIKACHU_100_1000	I think...yeah, this is the same Sableye I met in the\npolice station. We were roommates, actually.
A5_2690_TIM_100_2000	But what’s a photo of it doing here?
A5_2690_PIKACHU_100_2000	There’s something written on the back.
A5_2690_TIM_100_3000	Oh, you’re right... “It eats jewels, so watch out.”
A5_2690_PIKACHU_100_3000	Huh? What exactly are people supposed to watch\nout for?
A5_2700_PIKACHU_100_1000	What’s this? Something from the management team\nto the research team...
A5_2700_TIM_100_1000	“Handle the Aurora Drop with care and disinfect it.
A5_2700_TIM_100_2000	“It may be coated with Cramorant saliva.
A5_2700_TIM_100_3000	“Be sure to finish before Mayor Myers comes to\ninspect.” Huh?
A5_2710_TIM_100_1000	These documents are full of complicated-looking\nequations.
A5_2710_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, it’d take a specialist to make sense of all this.
A5_2720_TIM_100_1000	This looks like a report about some experiments.
A5_2720_TIM_100_2000	But why is there another photo of the Aurora Drop\nattached to it?
A5_2720_PIKACHU_100_1000	Good question. How ’bout you skim the report and\nsee what it says?
A5_2720_TIM_100_3000	“Did the Aurora Drop Fall from Space?” And a couple\nof other section titles...
A5_2720_TIM_100_4000	Namely, “Meteorites and Extraterrestrial Viruses”\nand “The Aurora Drop and Meteoritic Energy.”
A5_2720_PIKACHU_100_2000	<color=#F39800FF>The Aurora Drop...and outer space?</color>
A5_2720_TIM_100_5000	I can’t wrap my head around what this research is\neven about.
A5_2740_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like there’s nothing else to investigate here.
A5_2741_PIKACHU_100_1000	I don’t see anything else I’m particularly curious\nabout.
A5_2745_TIM_100_1000	Seems like Unitas has been doing some really\ndetailed research on the Aurora Drop.
A5_2745_PIKACHU_100_1000	They might’ve had something to do with its theft too.
A5_2745_PIKACHU_100_2000	Why don’t we think about this for a second, Tim?
A5_2750_PIKACHU_100_1000	I doubt there’s anything else to find in this room.
A5_2750_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, you’re right. Darn...
A5_2755_TIM_100_1000	Well, now we know why the Aurora Drop was stolen...
A5_2755_PIKACHU_100_1000	But we still haven’t found the passcode for the stairs.
A5_2755_TIM_100_2000	Let’s really give this room a thorough search. Maybe\nwe’ll find the passcode somewhere.
A5_2760_PIKACHU_100_1000	All right. Let’s use this thing to flush those guys out.
A5_2760_TIM_100_1000	Will Growlithe and the others be OK?
A5_2760_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hmm, good point—they should probably stay clear of\nthe stairs. Let’s go let ’em know.
A5_2760_PIKACHU_100_3000	OK, we got ’em all to move.
A5_2760_PIKACHU_100_4000	Now those Unitas mooks won’t run into them when\nthey leave the room.
A5_2760_TIM_100_2000	Phew. OK, here goes nothing.
A5_2760_TIM_100_3000	Let’s see... The number for the room next door iiis...
A5_2780_PIKACHU_100_1000	Sounds like it worked!
A5_2780_PIKACHU_100_2000	Now that those Unitas bozos are gone, we can finally\nget into the standby room.
A5_2780_TIM_100_1000	Let’s check it out before they come back.
A5_2781_RACHEL_100_1000	Wow, Tim! That was quite a performance you just\npulled off!
A5_2781_TIM_100_1000	I’m just lucky it actually worked.
A5_2781_TIM_100_2000	Now I sure hope the passcode is in that room...
A5_2782_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow!
A5_2782_PIKACHU_100_1000	She says it looks like we’ll be able to get downstairs\nafter all.
A5_2782_TIM_100_1000	As long as we can find the passcode in that room...
A5_2783_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar?
A5_2783_PIKACHU_100_1000	He wants to know if he should come along.
A5_2783_TIM_100_1000	No, Darmanitan, we need you to wait here and keep\na lookout in case Unitas comes back.
A5_2784_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux.
A5_2784_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says those humans were foolish to leave their post\nwithout even confirming the source of their orders.
A5_2784_PIKACHU_100_2000	I get the impression they weren’t trained all that well.
A5_2785_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro...
A5_2785_PIKACHU_100_1000	Don’t worry, Pangoro. We cleared ’em all outta there.
A5_2785_PIKACHU_100_2000	There won’t be any problems.
A5_2800_MARUMINE_100_1000	Elec?!
A5_2800_TIM_100_1000	Wha—?!
A5_2800_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oh, yikes! Electrode’s still here!
A5_2800_MARUMINE_100_2000	Ell!
A5_2800_PIKACHU_100_2000	Ohhh, no...
A5_2800_TIM_100_2000	Wait... Is this Electrode about to use Self-Destruct?!
A5_2800_MARUMINE_100_3000	Ell!
A5_2800_PIKACHU_100_3000	Sure looks like it. This is bad, Tim!
A5_2800_TIM_100_3000	We’ve got to calm Electrode down! But how?
A5_2800_RACHEL_100_1000	I think I know a way, Tim!
A5_2800_RACHEL_100_2000	Pokémon can’t use Self-Destruct if there’s too much\nmoisture in the air!
A5_2800_PIKACHU_100_4000	Really?! Then that means—
A5_2800_TIM_100_4000	We just need to dampen the air! Thanks, Rachel!
A5_2800_PIKACHU_100_5000	Let’s hurry, Tim!
A5_2810_RACHEL_100_1000	Pokémon can’t use Self-Destruct if there’s too much\nmoisture in the air!
A5_2810_TIM_100_1000	So we just need to dampen the air—thanks, Rachel!
A5_2811_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow?!
A5_2811_PIKACHU_100_1000	Calm down, Growlithe. It’s OK.
A5_2811_PIKACHU_100_2000	Tim and I are gonna handle this!
A5_2812_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar!
A5_2812_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’ll pick up Electrode and carry it far away?!
A5_2812_TIM_100_1000	Thanks, Darmanitan, but you can leave this to us.
A5_2813_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux?
A5_2813_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s asking how we plan on calming it down.
A5_2813_TIM_100_1000	We’ve already thought of a way. We just need to get\nhelp from a certain Pokémon...
A5_2814_TIM_100_1000	Pangoro seems awfully calm in spite of the\ncircumstances.
A5_2814_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro.
A5_2814_PIKACHU_100_1000	Pangoro said he knows there’s no problem as long as\nwe’re here. Hey, now this guy gets it!
A5_2815_TIM_100_1000	What if we splash this water all over the room?
A5_2815_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, everything’ll get soaked, for one thing. And I’m\nnot sure it’ll stop the Self-Destruct...
A5_2815_PIKACHU_100_2000	Is there a better way to dampen the air in the room?
A5_2815_TIM_100_2000	There has to be. Let’s think of a different approach to\nstopping the Self-Destruct.
A5_2815_PIKACHU_200_1000	Isn’t there a better way than splashing water all over\nthe room?
A5_2815_TIM_200_1000	There has to be. Let’s think of a different approach to\nstopping the Self-Destruct.
A5_2820_PIKACHU_100_1000	Watch out! Don’t get too close to Electrode!
A5_2840_UPAH_100_1000	Wooper?
A5_2840_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wooper, we need your help. An Electrode in the next\nroom over is about to use Self-Destruct and explode!
A5_2840_PIKACHU_100_2000	Could you come with us and dampen the air in there?
A5_2840_UPAH_100_2000	Woop!
A5_2840_PIKACHU_100_3000	Thanks a ton. I knew we could count on you, buddy.
A5_2840_TIM_100_1000	It’s willing to help us? Thanks, Wooper! You’re a real\nlifesaver!
A5_2840_UPAH_100_3000	Wooper!
A5_2840_PIKACHU_100_4000	OK, let’s go stop that Electrode!
A5_2847_MARUMINE_100_1000	Elec elec.
A5_2847_PIKACHU_100_1000	It says thanks for stopping the explosion.
A5_2847_TIM_100_1000	The credit should really go to Wooper.
A5_2847_PIKACHU_100_2000	It’s OK to take some credit now and then, Tim.
A5_2847_PIKACHU_100_3000	But hey, Electrode—why’d you rev up to explode all\nof a sudden?
A5_2847_MARUMINE_100_2000	Elec.
A5_2847_PIKACHU_100_4000	You got startled by some strangers showing up outta\nthe blue, huh?
A5_2847_TIM_100_2000	So it wasn’t ordered to attack us or anything.
A5_2847_MARUMINE_100_3000	Elec.
A5_2847_PIKACHU_100_5000	Apparently its only orders were to wait here.
A5_2847_MARUMINE_200_1000	Elec lec.
A5_2847_SEL_0_1000	About you, Electrode...
A5_2847_SEL_0_2000	About Unitas...
A5_2847_TIM_300_1000	Could you tell us a little about yourself?
A5_2847_MARUMINE_300_1000	Elec.
A5_2847_PIKACHU_300_1000	It says it’s much more prone to exploding when it’s\nstressed.
A5_2847_TIM_300_2000	I imagine being shut in a little room like this would\nbe really stressful.
A5_2847_MARUMINE_300_2000	Elec lec!
A5_2847_PIKACHU_300_2000	Apparently that’s not the problem.
A5_2847_PIKACHU_300_3000	It’s just upset that those Unitas folks haven’t been\nplaying with it much recently.
A5_2847_TIM_300_3000	Oh, I see...
A5_2847_PIKACHU_400_1000	Can you tell us anything about the people in white\nuniforms who were in this room earlier?
A5_2847_MARUMINE_400_1000	Elec.
A5_2847_PIKACHU_400_2000	Oh. This Electrode wasn’t brought here by force.
A5_2847_MARUMINE_400_2000	Elec.
A5_2847_PIKACHU_400_3000	It’s been the partner of a Unitas member since before\nall this happened.
A5_2847_TIM_400_1000	Really? Huh. I guess some people in Unitas actually\ncare about Pokémon.
A5_2847_MARUMINE_400_3000	Elec lec.
A5_2847_PIKACHU_400_4000	Electrode says they’re all really friendly.
A5_2847_TIM_400_2000	I’m surprised to hear that.
A5_2847_TIM_400_3000	They’ve been using Pokémon like tools—it’s hard to\nimagine them as anything other than bad guys.
A5_2847_PIKACHU_400_5000	Maybe they were just nice around Electrode so it\nwouldn’t explode.
A5_2847_TIM_400_4000	Somehow that’s even harder to imagine...
A5_2847_MARUMINE_400_4000	Elec?
A5_2850_TIM_100_1000	Now that Electrode’s calmed down, we can finally\nsearch this room.
A5_2850_RACHEL_100_1000	Wooper’s Ability really came in clutch!
A5_2850_TIM_100_2000	Thanks, Wooper. We really appreciate you defusing\nthe situation before it could blow up in our faces.
A5_2850_UPAH_100_1000	Wooper!
A5_2850_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, Tim. Let’s get to it.
A5_2850_TIM_100_3000	Right. We need to find the passcode to the stairs.
A5_2860_RACHEL_100_1000	I’m glad Electrode calmed down.
A5_2860_RACHEL_100_2000	Things could’ve gone very badly if it had exploded.
A5_2860_PIKACHU_100_1000	Sure, but blasting a hole in the floor might’ve at least\ngiven us a way down.
A5_2860_TIM_100_1000	Is that how you were planning on getting downstairs?\nWow. Poor Electrode.
A5_2860_RACHEL_100_3000	What? What did Pikachu say?
A5_2860_TIM_100_2000	Umm... I think you’re better off not knowing.
A5_2860_PIKACHU_100_2000	Sorry, sorry. Just kidding, y’know.
A5_2860_RACHEL_200_1000	I’m glad Electrode calmed down.
A5_2870_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow...
A5_2870_TIM_100_1000	Is something wrong? She looks kind of down.
A5_2870_GARDIE_100_2000	Gow gow.
A5_2870_PIKACHU_100_1000	She’s feeling worn out after all that fuss about an\nimpending explosion.
A5_2870_TIM_100_2000	I can relate... I’m a little worn out myself.
A5_2870_GARDIE_200_1000	Gow...
A5_2870_PIKACHU_200_1000	She’s feeling worn out after all that fuss about an\nimpending explosion.
A5_2880_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar darma.
A5_2880_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says there’s no way he could’ve stopped Electrode\nfrom exploding on his own.
A5_2880_TIM_100_1000	No one could’ve managed that alone. We pulled it\noff thanks to everyone working together.
A5_2880_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Dardar!
A5_2880_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Dar darma.
A5_2880_PIKACHU_200_1000	He says there’s no way he could’ve stopped Electrode\nfrom exploding on his own.
A5_2890_TIM_100_1000	Why are you staring at me like that, Luxray?
A5_2890_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux.
A5_2890_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says it’s impressive that you were able to calm\nElectrode down in such a tense situation.
A5_2890_PIKACHU_100_2000	He’s finally recognized what you’re capable of, Tim.
A5_2890_TIM_100_2000	Thanks, Luxray—I’m glad I was able to earn your trust.\nBut in this case, all the credit goes to Wooper.
A5_2890_RENTORAR_200_1000	Lux.
A5_2890_PIKACHU_200_1000	He says it’s impressive that you were able to calm\nElectrode down in such a tense situation.
A5_2890_PIKACHU_200_2000	He’s finally recognized what you’re capable of, Tim.
A5_2900_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro.
A5_2900_PIKACHU_100_1000	He thinks Electrode’s a real nuisance for trying to\nexplode outta nowhere like that.
A5_2900_TIM_100_1000	Well, that’s all in the past now.
A5_2900_TIM_100_2000	And in Electrode’s defense, it was really startled by\neverything happening so suddenly.
A5_2900_GORONDA_100_2000	Goro...
A5_2900_GORONDA_200_1000	Goro.
A5_2900_PIKACHU_200_1000	Yeah, but I’m sure Electrode was seriously shocked by\neverything happening so suddenly.
A5_29010_GARDIE_100_1000	(What does this say?)
A5_29010_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s the name of the building—“Pokémon Unity Lab.”
A5_29060_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(What’s this weird rock?)
A5_29060_PIKACHU_100_1000	The name of the building is written on it—“Pokémon\nUnity Lab.”
A5_2910_UPAH_100_1000	Wooper.
A5_2910_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thanks for your help, Wooper.
A5_2910_UPAH_200_1000	Wooper.
A5_29110_RENTORAR_100_1000	(There’s nothing behind this.)
A5_29110_PIKACHU_100_1000	Guess the hidden hallway is somewhere else. Let’s\nkeep looking.
A5_29120_RENTORAR_100_1000	(There’s nothing behind this.)
A5_29120_PIKACHU_100_1000	Guess the hidden hallway is somewhere else. Let’s\nkeep looking.
A5_29130_RENTORAR_100_1000	(There’s nothing behind this.)
A5_29130_PIKACHU_100_1000	Guess the hidden hallway is somewhere else. Let’s\nkeep looking.
A5_29160_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Would this taste good in curry?)
A5_29160_PIKACHU_100_1000	Stop it! That’s not food!
A5_29170_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Would this taste good in curry?)
A5_29170_PIKACHU_100_1000	Stop it! That’s not food!
A5_29180_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	(Would this taste good in curry?)
A5_29180_PIKACHU_100_1000	Stop it! That’s not food!
A5_2930_TIM_100_1000	This is Unitas’s schedule for today.
A5_2930_TIM_100_2000	“Bring in the Aurora Drop.\nMayor Myers’s inspection...
A5_2930_TIM_100_3000	“Ship out the cubes.”
A5_2930_TIM_200_1000	Unitas’s schedule for today...
A5_2930_TIM_200_2000	“Bring in the Aurora Drop,” “Mayor Myers’s\ninspection,” and “Ship out the cubes.”
A5_2940_TIM_100_1000	Someone wrote down the passcode to the stairs!
A5_2940_PIKACHU_100_1000	Awesome! Now we can get down to floor B2!
A5_2940_TIM_100_2000	Yeah! The passcode is 7020.
A5_2940_PIKACHU_100_2000	OK, then let’s head to the stairs as soon as we finish\ninvestigating this floor.
A5_2940_TIM_200_1000	The passcode to the stairs is 7020.
A5_2950_TIM_100_1000	Hmm, let’s see what these papers are...
A5_2950_TIM_100_2000	“From the management team to the research team:
A5_2950_TIM_100_3000	“To optimize research efficiency, voice recorders for\ndictating notes will be distributed to all research\npersonnel.”
A5_2950_TIM_100_4000	Looks like the researchers here use voice recorders.
A5_2950_PIKACHU_100_1000	Dictating notes sounds way more convenient than\nwriting ’em out. I oughta try that for detective work.
A5_2950_TIM_100_5000	I think we’re doing just fine with regular written notes.
A5_2950_PIKACHU_100_2000	But wouldn’t it be handy if we could record witness\nstatements?
A5_2950_TIM_100_6000	Ah, that actually does sound pretty helpful now that\nyou mention it.
A5_2950_TIM_200_1000	It’s a note written by someone in Unitas.
A5_2950_TIM_200_2000	Looks like the scientists at this facility use voice\nrecorders to dictate notes.
A5_2960_TIM_100_1000	This document’s full of information written in fine\nprint.
A5_2960_TIM_100_2000	And look at these section headings: “Sanjeev\nDenis’s Mansion,” “Pokémon inside the Mansion...”
A5_2960_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like they did their homework before stealing\nthe Aurora Drop.
A5_2960_TIM_200_1000	This document is full of details about Mr. Denis’s\nmansion.
A5_2960_TIM_200_2000	Looks like they did their homework before stealing\nthe Aurora Drop.
A5_2965_TIM_100_1000	The door to the stairs is locked.
A5_2965_PIKACHU_100_1000	We gotta enter the passcode into the terminal next\nto it.
A5_2970_TIM_100_1000	Let’s enter the passcode.
A5_2970_PIKACHU_100_1000	It should be that four-digit number we just found.
A5_2990_PIKACHU_100_1000	All right, Tim! It’s unlocked!
A5_2990_TIM_100_1000	Yeah! Now we can go to floor B2.
A5_3010_TIM_100_1000	OK, let’s head downstairs.
A5_3010_PIKACHU_100_1000	This way, everyone! We gotta be quiet though.
A5_3010_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow!
A5_3120_TIM_100_1000	Well, we’re finally on B2.
A5_3120_RACHEL_100_1000	It’s a lot quieter than the floor above. It’s like there’s\nno one here at all.
A5_3120_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s gonna be an echofest if we all go down these\nhalls together.
A5_3120_TIM_100_2000	Yeah. It might be better if the rest of you wait here.
A5_3120_RACHEL_100_2000	OK. Be careful, Tim!
A5_3120_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hey, check it out! There’s a floor map over there.
A5_3120_TIM_100_3000	Looks like there’s a big storage room on this floor.
A5_3120_TIM_100_4000	And on the other side of that storage room are the\nstairs leading down to the next floor.
A5_3120_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yeesh, that’s gonna be a hike... Guess we better\nget going.
A5_3120_TIM_100_5000	Looks like we’ll need another passcode to access\nthose stairs too.
A5_3120_PIKACHU_100_4000	Gotcha. Let’s look for it on our way, then.
A5_3130_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey Tim, we don’t need to go back upstairs!
A5_3130_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, you’re right. Let’s check out this floor.
A5_3140_RACHEL_100_1000	It’s quiet...maybe even a little TOO quiet. You don’t\nthink it’s a trap, do you?
A5_3140_TIM_100_1000	I don’t think so. I’m pretty sure no one even knows\nwe’re here.
A5_3140_TIM_100_2000	But we should still be prepared, just in case. Pikachu\nand I will go ahead and scout things out.
A5_3140_RACHEL_100_2000	Thanks, Tim. Thanks, Pikachu. Be careful, you two!
A5_3140_RACHEL_200_1000	Be careful. We don’t know what you’ll find down here.
A5_3150_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow?
A5_3150_PIKACHU_100_1000	She’s asking if we need her to sniff anything else out.
A5_3150_TIM_100_1000	Thanks, Growlithe, but we’re going to check this floor\nout first. We’d like you and the others to wait here.
A5_3150_GARDIE_100_2000	Gow!
A5_3150_TIM_200_1000	We’ll investigate this floor, Growlithe. Can you and\nthe others wait here?
A5_3150_GARDIE_200_1000	Gow!
A5_3160_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar!
A5_3160_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says he’ll wait here.
A5_3160_TIM_100_1000	We’ll let you know if you we need your help!
A5_3160_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Dar!
A5_3160_PIKACHU_200_1000	He says he’ll wait here.
A5_3170_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux.
A5_3170_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’ll keep watch here while we investigate?
A5_3170_TIM_100_1000	Thanks, Luxray. Let us know if anything happens.
A5_3170_RENTORAR_200_1000	Lux.
A5_3170_PIKACHU_200_1000	We’re counting on ya to keep watch, Luxray.
A5_3180_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro?
A5_3180_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s right, Pangoro—you just wait here.
A5_3180_TIM_100_1000	Be careful not to let Unitas spot you.
A5_3180_GORONDA_200_1000	Goro.
A5_3180_PIKACHU_200_1000	That’s right, Pangoro—you just wait here.
A5_3190_TIM_100_1000	The elevator is stopped on B5.
A5_3200_TIM_100_1000	It’s a map of this floor.
A5_3200_TIM_100_2000	It looks like this floor is used for storage.
A5_3200_PIKACHU_100_1000	There aren’t many rooms, but with all the stuff they’re\nstoring in ’em, visibility’s probably not the greatest.
A5_3200_TIM_100_3000	The stairs are on the other side of the storage area.\nLet’s try to make our way there.
A5_3204_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hm?
A5_3204_TIM_100_1000	What is this place?
A5_3210_PIKACHU_100_1000	These machines are probably used for research.
A5_3210_TIM_100_1000	Sure, but...what’s that rock?
A5_3210_PIKACHU_100_2000	Dunno. Let’s take a look around.
A5_3220_PIKACHU_100_1000	I know we’re headed to the stairs, but aren’t you even\na little curious about this area?
A5_3220_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, you’re right... Let’s investigate.
A5_3230_TIM_100_1000	There are a bunch of papers here.
A5_3230_TIM_100_2000	Here’s a message from the research team to the\noperations team.
A5_3230_TIM_100_3000	And these papers are from the management team to\nthe operations team...
A5_3230_PIKACHU_100_1000	They’re all addressed to the same team.
A5_3230_TIM_100_4000	Which means whoever’s desk this is must be on the\noperations team.
A5_3230_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’m curious about what that team’s been up to.
A5_3230_TIM_200_1000	This desk seems to belong to a member of the\noperations team.
A5_3230_PIKACHU_200_1000	I’m curious about what the Unitas operations team’s\nbeen up to.
A5_3250_TIM_100_1000	There are some papers here. Looks like they were\nwritten by someone in Unitas.
A5_3250_PIKACHU_100_1000	Go ahead and read ’em, then.
A5_3250_TIM_100_2000	They seem to be documents about the ruins.
A5_3250_TIM_100_3000	<color=#F39800FF>“Many meteorites landed throughout the southern\nruins in the past.</color>
A5_3250_TIM_100_4000	“A significant number of these meteorites still remain\nburied in the immediate vicinity of the ruins.”
A5_3250_PIKACHU_100_3000	Sounds like lookin’ around in here might help us\nfigure out what Unitas was up to in the ruins.
A5_3250_TIM_100_5000	Yeah, probably. Let’s investigate.
A5_3250_PIKACHU_200_1000	Let’s investigate this room.
A5_3260_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, where should we start looking?
A5_3260_PIKACHU_200_1000	Is there anywhere you forgot to look?
A5_3270_PIKACHU_5000_1000	Hey, Tim. You haven’t investigated everything yet.
A5_3280_PIKACHU_100_1000	If you have questions about anything\nyou see here, just ask me!
A5_3280_PIKACHU_100_2000	Getting help from others is nothing\nto be embarrassed about!
A5_3290_TIM_100_1000	These papers look like lab results from an analysis of\nthe meteorites.
A5_3290_TIM_100_2000	“The meteorites found at the ruins are made of an\nincredibly hard material that cannot be crushed\nor scratched.”
A5_3290_TIM_100_3000	“It is unlike any metal heretofore discovered on this\nplanet.”
A5_3290_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wow, they’re <color=#F39800FF>really that hard</color>?
A5_3290_TIM_100_4000	What were they brought here for?
A5_3300_TIM_100_1000	This paper’s got some names with short comments\nunder them.
A5_3300_TIM_100_2000	“Successfully completed mission at the ruins.\nExceeds expectations.”
A5_3300_PIKACHU_100_1000	Seems like <color=#F39800FF>a performance review for the Unitas\nmember we saw at the ruins</color>.
A5_3300_TIM_100_3000	Huh. I guess in some ways they’re just like any other\ncompany.
A5_3310_TIM_100_1000	Hmm, what are these documents? There’s a damage\nreport and some photos of the facility’s interior.
A5_3310_TIM_100_2000	According to this, the berserk Pokémon caused a lot\nof structural damage during the R incident.
A5_3310_TIM_100_3000	<color=#F39800FF>And some other areas have really deteriorated since\nthen too.</color>
A5_3310_PIKACHU_100_1000	Guess that’s what happens to a place when you stop\npaying the maintenance bill.
A5_3320_TIM_100_1000	Hmm... Do you think this rock could be one of the\nmeteorites we read about?
A5_3320_PIKACHU_100_1000	Sure seems like it. They must have used this\nequipment to analyze it.
A5_3330_TIM_100_1000	Looks like this file contains lab results from an analysis\nof the meteorites.
A5_3330_TIM_100_2000	“The meteorites found at the southern ruins are not\nonly exceedingly hard but also contain incredibly\npure energy.
A5_3330_TIM_100_3000	“Those exhibiting an energy content of 87 percent or\nhigher are to be delivered to the lowest floor for use.
A5_3330_TIM_100_4000	“The meteorites discovered in Mewtwo’s cave are low\nin energy and cannot be used.”
A5_3330_PIKACHU_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>So this meteorite contains energy? I guess it’s more\nthan just a normal rock.</color>
A5_3350_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like there’s nothing else to investigate here.
A5_3351_PIKACHU_100_1000	I don’t see anything else I’m particularly curious\nabout.
A5_3355_PIKACHU_100_1000	Have you figured out why Unitas came to the ruins?
A5_3355_TIM_100_1000	I think so. It should be clear if we piece together all\nthis evidence.
A5_3360_PIKACHU_100_1000	I think that’s about all we can be sure of at this point.
A5_3360_TIM_100_1000	Yeah. Let’s keep moving.
A5_3370_TIM_100_1000	We can’t go any farther with these containers in\nthe way...
A5_3370_PIKACHU_100_1000	Then we’ll just have to move ’em. Let’s go ask\nPangoro for help.
A5_3380_TIM_100_1000	Some large containers are blocking our way.
A5_3380_RACHEL_100_1000	Then why don’t you ask Pangoro for help?
A5_3380_RACHEL_200_1000	If you can’t get past the containers, why don’t you ask\nPangoro for help?
A5_3390_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow...
A5_3390_PIKACHU_100_1000	She feels bad that she can’t push the containers\nfor us.
A5_3390_TIM_100_1000	Don’t worry about that, Growlithe.
A5_3390_TIM_100_2000	You’ve got your own skills that are just as valuable.
A5_3390_TIM_100_3000	Can we leave you in charge of sniffing out trouble\nwith that fantastic nose of yours?
A5_3390_GARDIE_100_2000	Gow!
A5_3390_GARDIE_200_1000	Gow...
A5_3390_PIKACHU_200_1000	She feels bad that she can’t push the containers\nfor us.
A5_3400_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar...
A5_3400_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says he’s great at breaking stuff, but moving stuff?\nNot so easy.
A5_3400_TIM_100_1000	Hmm. Breaking that many containers is a big ask.\nWe’re gonna see if someone else can help.
A5_3400_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Dar.
A5_3400_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Dar...
A5_3400_PIKACHU_200_1000	He says he’s great at breaking stuff, but moving stuff?\nNot so easy.
A5_3410_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux?
A5_3410_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s asking how we plan to move forward from here.
A5_3410_TIM_100_1000	We’re gonna ask Pangoro for help. He should be able\nto move those containers.
A5_3410_RENTORAR_100_2000	Lux...
A5_3410_PIKACHU_100_2000	He says that oughta work.
A5_3410_RENTORAR_200_1000	Lux.
A5_3410_PIKACHU_200_1000	He says it oughta be fine to leave this to Pangoro.
A5_3410_TIM_200_1000	He must put a lot of trust in Pangoro.
A5_3420_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro?
A5_3420_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s asking if we need his help.
A5_3420_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_3420_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_3420_PIKACHU_300_1000	Please help us out, Pangoro. We’re really countin’\non ya.
A5_3420_GORONDA_300_1000	Goro.
A5_3420_PIKACHU_400_1000	There’s still something I wanna check...
A5_3420_GORONDA_400_1000	Goro...
A5_3425_TIM_100_1000	Nice! Pangoro cleared the way for us.
A5_3425_PIKACHU_100_1000	Just a little farther to the stairs now.
A5_3425_TIM_100_2000	There’s another map over there. Let’s take a look.
A5_3425_PIKACHU_100_2000	Looks like there’s another storage room past here.\nIf we can just get through that, we’ll be at the stairs.
A5_3425_TIM_100_3000	We still need the passcode, though...
A5_3425_PIKACHU_100_3000	I think I’ve got a lead on that. Check out that paper\nnext to the map.
A5_3425_TIM_100_4000	Hm? Lemme see...
A5_3425_TIM_100_5000	“The stairs passcode can be found in the standby\nroom.
A5_3425_TIM_100_6000	“Please return all controllers to the standby room.”
A5_3425_PIKACHU_100_4000	How’s that for handy? Guess our next stop’s the\nstandby room.
A5_3425_TIM_100_7000	And lucky for us, it’s on the other side of this next\nstorage room.
A5_3425_TIM_100_8000	But what do you think the “controllers” are?
A5_3425_PIKACHU_100_5000	I’m not sure... But I AM sure we’re not gonna find\nthe answer just standing here. Let’s head for the\nstandby room.
A5_3430_PIKACHU_100_1000	Where are you going, Tim?
A5_3430_TIM_100_1000	Oh, whoops. Wrong way.
A5_3436_TIM_100_1000	It’s a map of this floor.
A5_3436_PIKACHU_100_1000	According to the map, we’ve nearly reached the stairs.
A5_3437_TIM_100_1000	“The stairs passcode can be found in the standby\nroom.
A5_3437_TIM_100_2000	“Please return all controllers to the standby room.”
A5_3437_PIKACHU_100_1000	Sounds like this standby room gets a lot of use.
A5_3440_RACHEL_100_1000	The floor map shows a staircase just up ahead.
A5_3440_TIM_100_1000	Great. Now we just have to get there without being\nseen by Unitas.
A5_3440_RACHEL_200_1000	The floor map shows a staircase just up ahead.
A5_3450_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow?
A5_3450_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, you can all wait right here.
A5_3450_GARDIE_100_2000	Gow gow.
A5_3450_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’ll figure out a way to handle this.
A5_3450_GARDIE_200_1000	Gow?
A5_3450_PIKACHU_200_1000	Yeah, you can all wait right here.
A5_3460_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar?
A5_3460_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, you can all wait right here.
A5_3460_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Dar.
A5_3460_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’ll figure out a way to handle this.
A5_3460_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Dar.
A5_3460_PIKACHU_200_1000	We’ll figure out a way to handle this.
A5_3470_RENTORAR_100_1000	Ray.
A5_3470_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, you can all wait right here.
A5_3470_RENTORAR_100_2000	Luxray.
A5_3470_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’ll figure out a way to handle this.
A5_3470_RENTORAR_200_1000	Ray.
A5_3470_PIKACHU_200_1000	We’ll figure out a way to handle this.
A5_3480_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro.
A5_3480_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, you can all wait right here.
A5_3480_GORONDA_100_2000	Goro.
A5_3480_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’ll figure out a way to handle this.
A5_3480_GORONDA_200_1000	Goro.
A5_3480_PIKACHU_200_1000	We’ll figure out a way to handle this.
A5_3490_TIM_100_1000	We should be coming up on the stairs soon...
A5_3490_RACHEL_100_1000	Wait, Tim! There’s something over there!
A5_3510_TIM_100_1000	A Dusknoir! That cube on it must be forcing it to\nkeep watch.
A5_3510_PIKACHU_100_1000	We should give it a wide berth.
A5_3510_RACHEL_100_1000	But the poor thing’s being controlled... Isn’t there\nanything we can do to help?
A5_3510_PIKACHU_100_2000	That notice we saw said something about\ncontrollers, right?
A5_3510_TIM_100_2000	Hmm, yeah. It might’ve been talking about\ncube controllers.
A5_3510_TIM_100_3000	That notice said they’re in the standby room.
A5_3510_RACHEL_100_2000	So we can rescue Dusknoir once we reach the\nstandby room?
A5_3510_PIKACHU_100_3000	I think so, yeah—and we’re headed there anyway to\nget the passcode to the stairs.
A5_3510_TIM_100_4000	Right. Let’s head for the standby room, then—without\nbeing spotted by Dusknoir.
A5_3520_TIM_100_1000	It’s a terminal where we input the passcode.
A5_3520_PIKACHU_100_1000	And it’s asking for four digits... We oughta be able to\nfind the passcode in the standby room.
A5_3520_TIM_100_2000	Yeah. Maybe we can even help Dusknoir while we’re\nthere. Let’s head for that room in the back.
A5_3520_TIM_200_1000	I don’t think this door will open without a passcode.
A5_3525_TIM_100_1000	It’s the door leading downstairs, but it’s locked.
A5_3525_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well then, no point waiting here. We can find the\npasscode in the standby room.
A5_3550_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, we made it.
A5_3550_TIM_100_1000	We should be safe here for now.
A5_3550_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah. Now let’s hurry up and find that passcode and\na controller.
A5_3560_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, where are you going? We need to stop that\nDusknoir, remember?
A5_3570_TIM_100_1000	Look! It’s a cube controller!
A5_3570_PIKACHU_100_1000	Nice. We can use it to make Dusknoir stop patrolling.
A5_3570_TIM_100_2000	Yeah... Oh! And the passcode is written down\nright here!
A5_3570_PIKACHU_100_2000	The passcode is 2806, huh? All right—that’ll let us\nfinally use the stairs!
A5_3570_TIM_100_3000	OK then, let’s head back to Dusknoir.
A5_3590_YONOIR_100_1000	Noir.
A5_3590_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thanks for stopping that weird feeling?\nNo worries, pal. We gotcha.
A5_3590_PIKACHU_200_1000	Tell us what you know, Dusknoir.
A5_3590_YONOIR_200_1000	Noir.
A5_3590_SEL_0_1000	About you, Dusknoir...
A5_3590_SEL_0_2000	Why are you here?
A5_3590_PIKACHU_300_1000	Got any special skills, Dusknoir?
A5_3590_YONOIR_300_1000	Noir...
A5_3590_PIKACHU_300_2000	Huh? What was that? Something about...souls?
A5_3590_TIM_300_1000	Umm... I think we’re better off not asking Dusknoir\nto elaborate.
A5_3590_YONOIR_400_1000	Noir...
A5_3590_PIKACHU_400_1000	You really don’t know, eh? One day you were just\nsuddenly...here?
A5_3590_TIM_400_1000	The cube must’ve messed up its memory. I feel so bad\nfor it...
A5_3590_YONOIR_400_2000	Noir.
A5_3590_PIKACHU_400_2000	Sounds like Unitas has been controlling Dusknoir for a\nreal long time.
A5_3590_PIKACHU_400_3000	It’s been forced to patrol this area by itself for ages.
A5_3590_TIM_400_2000	That must’ve been so lonely...
A5_3590_YONOIR_400_3000	Noir...
A5_3595_PIKACHU_100_1000	All right, we can finally use the stairs!
A5_3595_TIM_100_1000	Yeah! I’ll just punch in the passcode, which was,\nuhhh...
A5_3595_PIKACHU_100_2000	2806.
A5_3600_RACHEL_100_1000	Now that Dusknoir’s calmed down, I think we’re ready\nto head downstairs.
A5_3600_TIM_100_1000	Yeah. I’ll enter the passcode.
A5_3600_RACHEL_200_1000	Now that Dusknoir’s calmed down, I think we’re ready\nto head downstairs.
A5_3610_GARDIE_100_1000	Gowww...
A5_3610_PIKACHU_100_1000	You feel bad for Dusknoir ’cause it was all alone for\nso long?
A5_3610_TIM_100_1000	Let’s help Dusknoir get back outside after we’re\ndone here.
A5_3610_GARDIE_100_2000	Gow!
A5_3610_GARDIE_200_1000	Gowww...
A5_3610_PIKACHU_200_1000	She feels bad for Dusknoir ’cause it was all alone for\nso long.
A5_3620_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Darma?
A5_3620_PIKACHU_100_1000	No, no, you don’t gotta smash the door down! We can\nopen it just fine with the passcode!
A5_3620_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Darma!
A5_3620_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, I understand. We’ll let you know as soon as we\nneed your help.
A5_3620_TIM_100_1000	I’m kinda hoping we won’t...
A5_3620_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Darma?
A5_3620_PIKACHU_200_1000	No, no, you don’t gotta smash the door down! We can\nopen it just fine with the passcode!
A5_3630_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux?
A5_3630_PIKACHU_100_1000	He wants to know if there’s anything else we still need\nto do on this floor.
A5_3630_TIM_100_1000	I’m pretty sure we already investigated everywhere...\nbut I can check just in case.
A5_3630_RENTORAR_100_2000	Ray...
A5_3630_RENTORAR_200_1000	Lux?
A5_3630_PIKACHU_200_1000	He wants to know if there’s anything else we still need\nto do on this floor.
A5_3640_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro...
A5_3640_PIKACHU_100_1000	If I hadn’t rescued you at the police station, you’d\nprobably still be under a cube’s control?
A5_3640_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, I suppose that’s possible. They probably wanted\nto use that impressive strength of yours.
A5_3640_TIM_100_1000	We need to put a stop to all that.
A5_3640_GORONDA_200_1000	Goro...
A5_3640_PIKACHU_200_1000	If I hadn’t rescued you, you’d probably still be under\na cube’s control? Yeah, I suppose so...
A5_3650_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s the paper with the passcode.
A5_3650_TIM_100_1000	It’s 2806.
A5_3660_TIM_100_1000	It’s a door to the stairs leading down.
A5_3660_PIKACHU_100_1000	Go ahead and enter that passcode we found into the\nterminal on the left.
A5_3670_TIM_100_1000	It’s a terminal where we input the passcode.
A5_3670_PIKACHU_100_1000	Go ahead and enter that passcode we found.
A5_3690_PIKACHU_100_1000	Nice, it’s unlocked! Part of me thought that passcode\nwasn’t gonna work...
A5_3690_TIM_100_1000	Now we can get to B3.
A5_3700_PIKACHU_100_1000	We haven’t forgotten to investigate anything on this\nfloor, have we?
A5_3700_TIM_100_1000	No, I think we’re fine. Let’s head down.
A5_3815_TIM_100_1000	All right, we made it to B3.
A5_3815_PIKACHU_100_1000	Another floor closer to the one the mayor’s supposed\nto visit.
A5_3815_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’ll need to be more careful than ever.
A5_3815_TIM_100_2000	Right. Our first order of business should be figuring\nout how we’re gonna get downstairs.
A5_3815_RACHEL_100_1000	If you need a floor map, there’s one right here.
A5_3815_PIKACHU_100_3000	I see. The stairs down to B4 are at the end of\nthis hallway.
A5_3815_RACHEL_100_2000	There’s a storage room past the stairs too...
A5_3815_RACHEL_100_3000	What do you suppose these “detainment rooms” in\nthe center are?
A5_3815_TIM_100_3000	Reminds me of the rooms at the police station...
A5_3815_PIKACHU_100_4000	If they’re the same as the rooms at the station, there\nmight be Pokémon being held there.
A5_3815_TIM_100_4000	I just hope there aren’t any more Pokémon that are\nenduring what Wooper went through.
A5_3815_PIKACHU_100_5000	I’m definitely curious about those detainment rooms,\nbut we should check out the stairs first.
A5_3815_PIKACHU_100_6000	We shouldn’t wander around and risk getting caught\nby Unitas.
A5_3815_TIM_100_5000	Right. Stairs first. Let’s go, Pikachu.
A5_3820_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, where are you going? No reason to go back\nupstairs now.
A5_3820_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, you’re right. Let’s investigate this floor.
A5_3825_RACHEL_100_1000	Just a little bit farther to the bottom floor.
A5_3825_RACHEL_100_2000	What in the world is Papa planning to do with this\nfacility?
A5_3825_TIM_100_1000	Do you really think he’s connected to Unitas?
A5_3825_RACHEL_100_3000	If he is, we still don’t know exactly what that\nconnection is.
A5_3825_TIM_100_2000	True, but this is your dad we’re talking about.
A5_3825_TIM_100_3000	I can’t imagine him trying to do anything bad.
A5_3825_RACHEL_100_4000	Yeah. I’d like to believe that too...
A5_3825_RACHEL_200_1000	What in the world is Papa thinking?
A5_3830_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow.
A5_3830_PIKACHU_100_1000	You smell a familiar scent—but it’s very faint?
A5_3830_PIKACHU_100_2000	What’re you smelling?
A5_3830_GARDIE_100_2000	Gow...
A5_3830_PIKACHU_100_3000	Oh, it’s too faint for you to identify.
A5_3830_PIKACHU_100_4000	I wonder what it could be...
A5_3830_GARDIE_200_1000	Gow.
A5_3830_PIKACHU_200_1000	You smell something familiar, huh?
A5_3835_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar...
A5_3835_PIKACHU_100_1000	This place feels similar to where they kept you captive\nbefore you escaped to the ruins?
A5_3835_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hm... I hope there’s nothing going on here.
A5_3835_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Dar...
A5_3835_PIKACHU_200_1000	This place feels similar to where they kept you captive\nbefore you escaped to the ruins, huh.
A5_3840_RENTORAR_100_1000	Luxray...
A5_3840_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wow, you seem real tense all of a sudden. What’s up?
A5_3840_RENTORAR_100_2000	Lux.
A5_3840_PIKACHU_100_2000	This floor somehow feels worse than the others, so\nyou want us to stay sharp?
A5_3840_PIKACHU_100_3000	Thanks for the warning, Luxray. We’ll be extra careful.
A5_3840_RENTORAR_200_1000	Lux.
A5_3840_PIKACHU_200_1000	This floor somehow feels worse than the others, so\nyou want us to stay sharp? OK, we will.
A5_3845_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro...
A5_3845_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’re uncomfortable ’cause this place reminds you of\nthe police station?
A5_3845_PIKACHU_100_2000	Gotta agree with you. This floor doesn’t exactly have\nthe most relaxing ambience.
A5_3845_GORONDA_200_1000	Goro...
A5_3845_PIKACHU_200_1000	You’re uncomfortable ’cause this place reminds you of\nthe police station, huh.
A5_3850_TIM_100_1000	It’s a map of this floor.
A5_3850_PIKACHU_100_1000	The stairs down to floor B4 are at the end of this\nhallway.
A5_3865_TIM_100_1000	Sounds like the Pokémon going berserk in that room\nis an Excadrill.
A5_3865_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, and they can’t stop it ’cause Cramorant\nswallowed their controller.
A5_3865_PIKACHU_100_2000	But we’ve got our own problems to deal with\nright now...
A5_3865_PIKACHU_100_3000	It sounds like the Unitas stooge who stayed on this\nfloor doesn’t have a card key for the elevator.
A5_3865_TIM_100_2000	And the other one said she was going to change the\npasscode to the stairs.
A5_3865_TIM_100_3000	Are we stuck here, then? How can we get downstairs?
A5_3865_PIKACHU_100_4000	Don’t give up now, Tim. For all we know, there’s an\nextra card key in that room!
A5_3865_TIM_100_4000	Maybe. But we’ve gotta stop that Excadrill first before\nwe can sleuth around in there.
A5_3865_PIKACHU_100_5000	Which means we need to find that Cramorant and get\nit to spit up that controller.
A5_3865_PIKACHU_100_6000	Going by that map we saw, there should be another\nroom up ahead.
A5_3865_PIKACHU_100_7000	Let’s start by checking there.
A5_3870_SECRETDORYUZU_100_1000	Driiill!
A5_3870_TIM_100_1000	An Excadrill’s going berserk in there.
A5_3870_PIKACHU_100_1000	We should probably steer clear of this room.
A5_3875_TIM_100_1000	The elevator is still stopped at floor B5.
A5_3875_PIKACHU_100_1000	I suppose they’re still working down on the bottom\nfloor. Good for them, I guess.
A5_3875_TIM_100_2000	We can’t use the elevator without a card key. Let’s\nlook around and see if we can find one.
A5_3880_TIM_100_1000	The door to this staircase requires a passcode to\nopen, same as the ones we’ve seen before.
A5_3880_PIKACHU_100_1000	Sure...but how do we figure out the new passcode\nnow that it’s been updated?
A5_3885_TIM_100_1000	The door won’t open unless we enter a passcode.
A5_3885_PIKACHU_100_1000	Just like the other floors, huh? Hope we can find a\nclue to figuring out that passcode...
A5_3890_PIKACHU_100_1000	This looks like a storage room.
A5_3890_TIM_100_1000	It seems like the only place Cramorant could’ve\nescaped to...
A5_3890_LHENEMYDARK01_100_1000	Heeey! Cramorant! Where’d ya go?! Come out, come\nout, wherever you aaare!
A5_3890_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh, man—it’s someone from Unitas!
A5_3890_TIM_100_2000	It’s too dangerous to go any further. We don’t know\nwhat we’re walking in to.
A5_3890_PIKACHU_100_3000	Let’s go back and join the others for a minute.
A5_3890_RACHEL_100_1000	I see. Thanks for catching us up.
A5_3890_PIKACHU_100_4000	<color=#F39800FF>The passcode for the stairway has been changed, and\ngetting a card key for the elevator is gonna be tricky.</color>
A5_3890_PIKACHU_100_5000	If we wanna find a way to get downstairs, the only\noption left is to search the detainment rooms.
A5_3890_TIM_100_3000	And to do that, we’ve gotta stop Excadrill.
A5_3890_TIM_100_4000	Our only hope is to find Cramorant before Unitas\ndoes and get the controller.
A5_3890_TIM_100_5000	If we can do that, we’ll be able to search inside those\nrooms.
A5_3890_RACHEL_100_2000	We’ll be able to help Excadrill too.
A5_3890_PIKACHU_100_6000	The question is, how do we find Cramorant without\ngetting caught by Unitas?
A5_3890_TIM_100_6000	If Cramorant’s hiding, it might be hard for just the two\nof us to find it on our own.
A5_3890_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow!
A5_3890_PIKACHU_100_7000	I appreciate the enthusiasm, Growlithe.
A5_3890_PIKACHU_100_8000	But we gotta emphasize stealth on this one.
A5_3890_TIM_100_7000	Which means the Pokémon we should be asking is...
A5_3890_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux?
A5_3890_PIKACHU_100_9000	Think you can help us out again, Luxray?
A5_3890_RENTORAR_100_2000	Ray!
A5_3895_PIKACHU_100_1000	Tim, look! We found Cramorant!
A5_3895_TIM_100_1000	Great! What about the controller?
A5_3895_PIKACHU_100_2000	Got that too! Now we can stop Excadrill.
A5_3895_RACHEL_100_1000	True to Great Detective form, Pikachu! And you did a\ngreat job, too, Luxray!
A5_3895_RENTORAR_100_1000	Ray.
A5_3895_PIKACHU_100_3000	Excadrill’s in the room just up ahead.
A5_3895_PIKACHU_100_4000	We can’t get close right now ’cause it’s going berserk,\nbut it should calm down if we use the controller to\ndeactivate the cube.
A5_3895_TIM_100_2000	Why is this controller sticky...? Actually, I don’t want\nto know. This part right here is the switch, right?
A5_3895_TIM_100_3000	I’ll try to get close to the room Excadrill’s in, then I’ll\npress the switch to turn off the cube.
A5_3895_PIKACHU_100_5000	Thanks, Tim.
A5_3895_PIKACHU_100_6000	Once that’s done, we need to search for a way to get\ndown to the next floor.
A5_3900_RACHEL_100_1000	We’ve got to hurry and help that Excadrill.
A5_3900_RACHEL_100_2000	The poor thing’s been stripped of its free will! I can’t\nthink of anything sadder...
A5_3900_TIM_100_1000	Me neither...
A5_3900_TIM_100_2000	But thanks to Pikachu, I’ve got the controller now.
A5_3900_PIKACHU_100_1000	So let’s pick up the pace and do something with it.
A5_3900_RACHEL_200_1000	We’ve got to hurry and help that Excadrill.
A5_3905_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow...
A5_3905_PIKACHU_100_1000	She says she’s glad Cramorant’s OK.
A5_3905_PIKACHU_100_2000	You’ve been worrying about Cramorant this whole\ntime, Growlithe?
A5_3905_GARDIE_100_2000	Gow!
A5_3905_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yeah, I guess he IS still like family to you—even after\nall that’s happened.
A5_3905_PIKACHU_100_4000	I’m sure he hasn’t forgotten you, either. After we’re\ndone here, you should tell him all about your\nadventures.
A5_3905_GARDIE_100_3000	Gow!
A5_3905_GARDIE_200_1000	Gow!
A5_3905_PIKACHU_200_1000	I guess Cramorant really IS like family to you—even\nafter all that’s happened.
A5_3910_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Darma!
A5_3910_PIKACHU_100_1000	You want us to hurry and stop the Pokémon that’s\nbeing controlled?
A5_3910_PIKACHU_100_2000	Then I got good news for ya—that’s exactly what\nwe’re gonna do.
A5_3910_TIM_100_1000	We need to help Excadrill as soon as possible.
A5_3910_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Darma!
A5_3910_PIKACHU_200_1000	Yeah, we need to hurry up and stop it.
A5_3915_RENTORAR_100_1000	Ray...
A5_3915_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thanks for helping us find Cramorant earlier.
A5_3915_RENTORAR_100_2000	Lux.
A5_3915_PIKACHU_100_2000	I hear ya—we’re gonna go release Excadrill ASAP.
A5_3915_TIM_100_1000	Luxray’s expression always looks...stoic...but he’s\nactually really worried about Excadrill, isn’t he?
A5_3915_RENTORAR_200_1000	Lux?
A5_3915_PIKACHU_200_1000	I hear ya—we’re gonna go release Excadrill ASAP.
A5_3920_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro?
A5_3920_PIKACHU_100_1000	Bingo—we’ll use this controller to set Excadrill free.
A5_3920_GORONDA_100_2000	Goro goro?
A5_3920_PIKACHU_100_2000	Slow down there, Pangoro... I’m not so sure about\nthat idea.
A5_3920_TIM_100_1000	What’s Pangoro saying?
A5_3920_PIKACHU_100_3000	He says we could stop Excadrill by grabbing it and\npulling the cube thing off its back.
A5_3920_TIM_100_2000	I guess Pangoro’s capable of that, but right now\nExcadrill is going totally berserk.
A5_3920_PIKACHU_100_4000	Yeah. And we don’t wanna throw Pangoro into danger\nif we can help it.
A5_3920_PIKACHU_100_5000	You’ll be our last resort, Pangoro. First we’re gonna\ntry the controller.
A5_3920_GORONDA_100_3000	Goro.
A5_3920_GORONDA_200_1000	Goro.
A5_3920_PIKACHU_200_1000	Just wait here, Pangoro. We don’t wanna make you\ndo anything too risky.
A5_3923_TIM_100_1000	So Cramorant swallowed the controller to Excadrill’s\ncube?
A5_3923_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. Thanks for the help earlier, Cramorant.
A5_3923_UU_100_1000	Craaam.
A5_3923_TIM_100_2000	I’d like to hear more of what Cramorant has to say.
A5_3923_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, let’s ask him some questions.
A5_3923_PIKACHU_200_1000	Hey Cramorant, can you answer some questions?
A5_3923_SEL_0_1000	About you, Cramorant...
A5_3923_SEL_0_2000	Why are you here?
A5_3923_TIM_300_1000	Cramorant swallows all sorts of things whole, right?
A5_3923_UU_300_1000	Cramoraaant.
A5_3923_PIKACHU_300_1000	Uh-huh. He says everyone started chasing him after\nhe swallowed some weird thing he didn’t recognize.
A5_3923_TIM_300_2000	Ah. That must’ve been Excadrill’s controller.
A5_3923_TIM_300_3000	I feel bad for Cramorant, but it turned out to be a\nlucky break for us!
A5_3923_PIKACHU_300_2000	Hear that, Cramorant? It’s thanks to you that we got\nthis controller we needed!
A5_3923_UU_300_2000	Craaam?
A5_3923_PIKACHU_300_3000	It’s fine if you don’t understand what’s going on,\nCramorant. The important thing is you really helped\nus out!
A5_3923_UU_300_3000	Craaam...
A5_3923_TIM_300_4000	He doesn’t sound very happy after you just laid all\nthat praise on him.
A5_3923_UU_300_4000	Cramorant...
A5_3923_PIKACHU_300_4000	Awww... You really miss Turner, don’t you?
A5_3923_UU_300_5000	Cram!
A5_3923_TIM_300_5000	Turner may be a jewel thief, but to Cramorant he’s his\nprecious partner...
A5_3923_PIKACHU_300_5000	Well said, Tim. I really hope we can get Cramorant\noutta here.
A5_3923_PIKACHU_400_1000	After you swallowed the jewel and flew away from the\nDenis residence...
A5_3923_PIKACHU_400_2000	What’d you do next—and why are you here now?
A5_3923_UU_400_1000	Craaam?
A5_3923_PIKACHU_400_3000	No idea, huh? Guess you were under that cube’s\ncontrol the whole time.
A5_3923_UU_400_1500	Cramoraaant.
A5_3923_PIKACHU_400_4000	You woke up and found yourself in this building?
A5_3923_UU_400_2000	Cramorant!
A5_3923_PIKACHU_400_5000	And the humans here forced you to cough up the\njewel?!
A5_3923_TIM_400_2000	That’s just messed up!
A5_3923_TIM_400_3000	Now that I think of it, Pawniard and Whimsicott were\nalso acting strange around the time of the jewel theft.
A5_3923_TIM_400_4000	They must have had cubes controlling them too!
A5_3923_PIKACHU_400_6000	Yeah. No doubt about that.
A5_3923_UU_400_3000	Cramoraaant.
A5_3923_PIKACHU_400_7000	He says he “like, totally hates” the humans in\nthis place.
A5_3923_TIM_400_5000	I mean, wouldn’t you? They controlled him, chased\nhim, and who knows what else. I really feel for the\npoor little guy.
A5_3923_UU_400_4000	Craaam...
A5_3925_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s no reason for us to go in that storage room\nright now.
A5_3925_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, you’re right.
A5_3930_PIKACHU_100_1000	Excadrill’s on the other side of this door.
A5_3930_PIKACHU_100_2000	You got the controller ready, Tim?
A5_3930_TIM_100_1000	Yep!
A5_3930_PIKACHU_100_3000	OK, let’s open the door!
A5_3940_TIM_100_1000	Oh, good. It looks like Excadrill’s settled down.
A5_3940_DORYUZU_100_1000	Driiill!
A5_3940_PIKACHU_100_1000	Now you’re free, Excadrill!
A5_3940_DORYUZU_100_2000	Dri driiill!
A5_3945_DORYUZU_100_1000	Drill.
A5_3945_TIM_100_1000	Think we can ask it some questions?
A5_3945_DORYUZU_100_2000	Drill!!
A5_3945_PIKACHU_100_1000	It says it’s willing to talk.
A5_3945_TIM_200_1000	Think we can ask it some questions?
A5_3945_DORYUZU_200_1000	Drill!
A5_3945_SEL_0_1000	About you, Excadrill...
A5_3945_SEL_0_2000	Why are you here?
A5_3945_PIKACHU_300_1000	<color=#F39800FF>Excadrill are good at digging holes, right?</color>
A5_3945_DORYUZU_300_1000	Driiill!
A5_3945_TIM_300_1000	It seems pretty proud of that.
A5_3945_DORYUZU_300_2000	Drill! Driiill!
A5_3945_PIKACHU_300_2000	It says it forms a single drill with its arms and head.
A5_3945_PIKACHU_300_2500	Drilling’s its specialty.
A5_3945_TIM_300_2000	Doesn’t it get dizzy when it drills?
A5_3945_PIKACHU_300_3000	I’m wondering about that too. Hey, Excadrill—do you\never get dizzy?
A5_3945_DORYUZU_300_3000	Drill!
A5_3945_PIKACHU_300_4000	Oof. It just said, “Don’t be ridiculous.”
A5_3945_TIM_300_3000	I guess spinning just comes naturally to it.
A5_3945_PIKACHU_400_1000	By the way, Excadrill, what are you doing in this\nplace?
A5_3945_DORYUZU_400_1000	Drill...
A5_3945_PIKACHU_400_2000	I see. Just like Dusknoir.
A5_3945_TIM_400_1000	So someone brought it here against its will and used\na cube to force it to keep watch...
A5_3945_DORYUZU_400_2000	Dridrill.
A5_3945_PIKACHU_400_3000	Apparently it tried to escape by drilling a hole in the\nwall, but things didn’t go as planned.
A5_3945_TIM_400_2000	The cube on its back probably stopped it from\nmoving freely.
A5_3945_RACHEL_400_1000	Treating Pokémon like this... It’s just too cruel!
A5_3945_PIKACHU_400_4000	What have the humans here been like?
A5_3945_DORYUZU_400_3000	Dridrill!
A5_3945_PIKACHU_400_5000	More mistreatment of Pokémon, huh.
A5_3945_DORYUZU_400_4000	Drill!
A5_3945_PIKACHU_400_6000	There are more captured Pokémon right here in\nthese rooms?!
A5_3945_TIM_400_3000	We can’t just leave them like this!
A5_3945_RACHEL_400_2000	Yeah, let’s set them free!
A5_3950_TIM_100_1000	So we were right about the detainment rooms—\nthey’re for holding Pokémon captive.
A5_3950_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wait, “detainment rooms”? Yeesh, you’d think we\nwere back at the police station. Same scummy names\nand everything...
A5_3950_TIM_100_2000	We’ve gotta figure out a way to rescue the\nPokémon here.
A5_3950_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah. If we search the room, we’ll probably come up\nwith something.
A5_3950_PIKACHU_100_3000	We needed to investigate this room anyway.
A5_3950_TIM_100_3000	Yeah, we still need to find a card key.
A5_3950_PIKACHU_100_4000	Right. OK, let’s get this investigation started, Tim!
A5_3970_RACHEL_100_1000	I’m so glad Excadrill’s all right...
A5_3970_TIM_100_1000	Yeah. I hate to think what could’ve happened to it if\nwe hadn’t shown up when we did...
A5_3970_RACHEL_100_2000	Seriously.
A5_3970_RACHEL_100_3000	If other Pokémon are suffering in the same way, we've\ngotta save them right away.
A5_3970_RACHEL_200_1000	I’m so glad Excadrill’s all right...
A5_3980_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow...
A5_3980_PIKACHU_100_1000	She says she’s glad Cramorant’s OK.
A5_3980_PIKACHU_100_2000	You’ve been worrying about Cramorant this whole\ntime, Growlithe?
A5_3980_GARDIE_100_2000	Gow!
A5_3980_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yeah, I guess he IS still like family to you—even after\nall that’s happened.
A5_3980_PIKACHU_100_4000	I’m sure he hasn’t forgotten you, either. After we’re\ndone here, you should tell him all about your\nadventures.
A5_3980_GARDIE_100_3000	Gow!
A5_3980_GARDIE_200_1000	Gow!
A5_3980_PIKACHU_200_1000	I guess Cramorant really IS like family to you—even\nafter all that’s happened.
A5_3990_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar...
A5_3990_PIKACHU_100_1000	He says this place looks like the facility where he and\nthe others were held captive before.
A5_3990_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Dar darma.
A5_3990_PIKACHU_100_2000	Sounds like there were lots of facilities like this.
A5_3990_PIKACHU_100_3000	Maybe they were conducting the same research there\nas they are here.
A5_3990_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Dar...
A5_3990_PIKACHU_200_1000	He says he’s got a bad feeling about this floor...
A5_4000_RENTORAR_100_1000	Luxray...
A5_4000_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s angry that more Pokémon are being held captive\nin those rooms.
A5_4000_TIM_100_1000	Considering what he went through back at the police\nstation, I can see why.
A5_4000_RENTORAR_100_2000	Lux.
A5_4000_PIKACHU_100_2000	Don’t worry. We’ll rescue ’em for sure.
A5_4000_RENTORAR_200_1000	Lux.
A5_4000_PIKACHU_200_1000	Don’t worry. We’ll rescue ’em for sure.
A5_40010_PIKACHU_100_1000	Having trouble figuring out how to get inside, Tim?
A5_40010_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_40010_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_40010_PIKACHU_300_1000	The way into the building must be hidden somewhere.
A5_40010_PIKACHU_300_2000	We’ll probably need a Pokémon’s help to find it.
A5_40010_PIKACHU_300_3000	Growlithe, Luxray, Darmanitan, and Pangoro...
A5_40010_PIKACHU_300_4000	Do we have something we could use to get one of\nthem to help us?
A5_40010_PIKACHU_300_5000	Think about what that “something” might be.
A5_40010_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. It IS important to think things through on your\nown, I suppose.
A5_40010_PIKACHU_400_2000	If you need help, just lemme know anytime!
A5_40020_PIKACHU_100_1000	Did you figure out what the people were doing here?
A5_40020_PIKACHU_100_2000	I could help if you’re having trouble...
A5_40020_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_40020_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_40020_PIKACHU_300_1000	I think the most important clue we’ve found so far was\nthat note.
A5_40020_PIKACHU_300_2000	The switchboard... The garbage... The hallway...
A5_40020_PIKACHU_300_3000	Was there something we missed when we were\nlooking around?
A5_40020_PIKACHU_300_4000	I think the key to answering THAT question lies in\nsomething we’ve already found.
A5_40020_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. It IS important to think things through on your\nown, I suppose.
A5_40020_PIKACHU_400_2000	If you need help, just lemme know anytime!
A5_40030_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’re thinking about Unitas’s connection to the\njewel theft, right?
A5_40030_PIKACHU_100_2000	I can help if you’re stumped.
A5_40030_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_40030_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_40030_PIKACHU_300_1000	The question is: What were they trying to use the\nAurora Drop for?
A5_40030_PIKACHU_300_2000	Wasn’t there a report about it?
A5_40030_PIKACHU_300_3000	Look back on the evidence we’ve written down in the\ncase notebook. I think you’ll find the answer there.
A5_40030_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. It IS important to think things through on your\nown, I suppose.
A5_40030_PIKACHU_400_2000	If you need help, just lemme know any time!
A5_40040_PIKACHU_100_1000	How to get into the standby room...
A5_40040_PIKACHU_100_2000	If you can’t think of a way, I could help you out.
A5_40040_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_40040_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_40040_PIKACHU_300_1000	Unitas posted a few notices on this floor, right?
A5_40040_PIKACHU_300_2000	Maybe one of ’em could give us a clue.
A5_40040_PIKACHU_300_3000	Try taking a good look at the notices posted to the\nwalls on this floor.
A5_40040_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. It IS important to think things through on your\nown, I suppose.
A5_40040_PIKACHU_400_2000	If you need help, just lemme know any time!
A5_40050_PIKACHU_100_1000	Did you forget the floor B1 passcode?
A5_40050_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_40050_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_40050_PIKACHU_300_1000	The floor B1 passcode is 7020. Try to remember,\nwill ya?
A5_40050_PIKACHU_400_1000	Oh. Well in that case, let’s open the door and get\ngoing already!
A5_40060_PIKACHU_100_1000	Do you need help working out why Unitas was at\nthe ruins?
A5_40060_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_40060_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_40060_PIKACHU_300_1000	We found documents about energy in that room,\nright?
A5_40060_PIKACHU_300_2000	Unitas brought high-purity meteorites down to the\nlowest level of the facility and is planning to use them\nfor something.
A5_40060_PIKACHU_300_3000	Take that fact and add it together with what we\nlearned from the documents about the ruins.
A5_40060_PIKACHU_300_4000	Then you’ll have your answer.
A5_40060_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. It IS important to think things through on your\nown, I suppose.
A5_40060_PIKACHU_400_2000	If you need help, just lemme know any time!
A5_40065_PIKACHU_100_1000	Did you forget the floor B2 password?
A5_40065_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_40065_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_40065_PIKACHU_300_1000	The floor B2 passcode is 2806. Try to remember,\nwill ya?
A5_40065_PIKACHU_400_1000	Oh. Well in that case, let’s open the door and get\ngoing already!
A5_40070_PIKACHU_100_1000	Having trouble thinking of a way to get downstairs?
A5_40070_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_40070_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_40070_PIKACHU_300_1000	Look at the floor in Hariyama’s detainment room.
A5_40070_PIKACHU_300_2000	It’s covered in big cracks.
A5_40070_PIKACHU_300_3000	We might be able to use those to get downstairs\nsomehow.
A5_40070_PIKACHU_300_4000	There should be a Pokémon who’s perfectly suited for\nopening up a hole for us.
A5_40070_PIKACHU_300_5000	Why don’t we ask it for help?
A5_40070_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. It IS important to think things through on your\nown, I suppose.
A5_40070_PIKACHU_400_2000	If you need help, just lemme know anytime!
A5_40080_PIKACHU_100_1000	Are you thinking about why Unitas was collecting all\nthose Pokémon?
A5_40080_PIKACHU_100_2000	Want me to help you out?
A5_40080_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_40080_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_40080_PIKACHU_300_1000	Think back to those documents we found on the desk.
A5_40080_PIKACHU_300_2000	We saw some reports about the cube experiments,\nremember?
A5_40080_PIKACHU_300_3000	Let’s think over the evidence we found.
A5_40080_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. It IS important to think things through on your\nown, I suppose.
A5_40080_PIKACHU_400_2000	If you need help, just lemme know anytime!
A5_40090_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’re investigating why Unitas went after Jessica,\nright?
A5_40090_PIKACHU_100_2000	If you’re stuck, I can help you.
A5_40090_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_40090_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_40090_PIKACHU_300_1000	Jessica was targeted on direct orders from Merloch.
A5_40090_PIKACHU_300_2000	To figure out why he’d give an order like that, we\nneed to know what’s going on in his head.
A5_40090_PIKACHU_300_3000	We can probably find some clues in Merloch’s lab.
A5_40090_PIKACHU_300_4000	If we thoroughly search this floor, I’m sure we can find\nthe answer.
A5_40090_PIKACHU_400_1000	OK. It IS important to think things through on your\nown, I suppose.
A5_40090_PIKACHU_400_2000	If you need help, just lemme know anytime!
A5_40095_PIKACHU_100_1000	Did you forget those numbers we saw earlier?
A5_40095_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_40095_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_40095_PIKACHU_300_1000	The numbers we saw were 200122 and 170608.
A5_40095_PIKACHU_300_2000	I just hope one of ’em opens the door.
A5_40095_PIKACHU_400_1000	Seems like you’ve got this handled. Go ahead and try\nopening the door already!
A5_4010_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro.
A5_4010_PIKACHU_100_1000	Huh? You wanna just punch our way through those\nUnitas goons so we can get downstairs?
A5_4010_PIKACHU_100_2000	I mean, I’m sure we could handle one or two of ’em,\nbut they've got us way outnumbered.
A5_4010_PIKACHU_100_3000	Our chances of beating ’em all seem pretty slim.
A5_4010_TIM_100_1000	That’s a, uhhh...pretty violent suggestion.
A5_4010_GORONDA_100_2000	Goro.
A5_4010_PIKACHU_100_4000	I hear you, but we don’t want you getting hurt.
A5_4010_PIKACHU_100_5000	The way I see it, asking you for help on this should\nbe our last resort. For now, we’re still looking for a\ncard key.
A5_4010_GORONDA_100_3000	Goro.
A5_4010_GORONDA_200_1000	Goro?
A5_4010_PIKACHU_200_1000	Just wait here, Pangoro. We don’t wanna make you\ndo anything too risky.
A5_40100_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve got everything we need to make our\ndeductions.
A5_40100_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s solve this puzzle, Tim!
A5_40100_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_40100_SEL_0_2000	No

A5_40150_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve got everything we need to make our\ndeductions.
A5_40150_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s solve this puzzle, Tim!
A5_40150_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_40150_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_40160_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve got everything we need to make our\ndeductions.
A5_40160_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s solve this puzzle, Tim!
A5_40160_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_40160_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_40170_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve got everything we need to make our\ndeductions.
A5_40170_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s solve this puzzle, Tim!
A5_40170_SEL_0_1000	Yes
A5_40170_SEL_0_2000	No
A5_4040_TIM_100_1000	This door’s locked.
A5_4040_PIKACHU_100_1000	We can’t free the Pokémon stuck in there till we find\na key.
A5_4050_TIM_100_1000	This door’s locked.
A5_4050_PIKACHU_100_1000	We can’t free the Pokémon stuck in there till we find\na key.
A5_4060_TIM_100_1000	It’s a list of rules for the Unitas patrol guards.
A5_4060_TIM_100_2000	“Guards are to patrol floor B3 in groups of two.
A5_4060_TIM_100_3000	“The sliding doors to the Pokémon detainment rooms\nmust be locked at all times.
A5_4060_TIM_100_4000	“Each pair of guards will keep a single card key for\nthe elevator.
A5_4060_TIM_100_5000	“When a pair of guards is relieved, they are to pass\nthe card key on to the next shift of guards.
A5_4060_TIM_100_6000	“The passcode to the stairs must be changed at the\nbeginning of each shift.”
A5_4060_PIKACHU_100_1000	The security here’s tighter than it was on the last\ncouple of floors.
A5_4060_TIM_100_7000	Sounds like the guards on patrol now are the only\npeople who know the passcode to the stairs.
A5_4060_PIKACHU_100_2000	Doubt they’ll share it with us willingly, either—no\nmatter how nicely we ask.
A5_4060_TIM_200_1000	It’s a list of rules for the Unitas patrol guards.
A5_4060_TIM_200_2000	It says the passcode to the stairs is changed every\ntime the guards change shifts.
A5_4060_PIKACHU_200_1000	They’re not just gonna go sharing it with us, either.
A5_4060_TIM_200_3000	I wonder if there’s any other way for us to\nget downstairs...
A5_4090_TIM_100_1000	Here’s a note from the operations team to the\nresearch team.
A5_4090_PIKACHU_100_1000	Could be important. Read it out, Tim.
A5_4090_TIM_100_2000	“The detainment rooms on floor B3 were intended to\nhold the Pokémon sent to us by Mr. Butler.
A5_4090_TIM_100_3000	“However, due to unforeseen circumstances, these\nPokémon will not be joining us.
A5_4090_TIM_100_4000	“As a result, the detainment rooms on floor B3 are\ncurrently housing Pokémon that were not part of our\noriginal plan.”
A5_4090_PIKACHU_100_2000	Butler, eh? Must be talking about what happened\nback at the police station.
A5_4090_TIM_100_5000	There’s a list here with dozens of Pokémon on it...
A5_4090_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hmmm... Looks like a list of all the Pokémon in\nthis facility.
A5_4090_PIKACHU_100_4000	Hm? Some of these names are crossed out.
A5_4090_TIM_100_6000	Luxray, Liepard, Impidimp, Sableye, Pangoro...
A5_4090_PIKACHU_100_5000	<color=#F39800FF>Those Pokémon were at the police station with me.\nSo, they were gonna be sent here too...</color>
A5_4090_TIM_100_7000	There are other names, too.
A5_4090_TIM_100_8000	Excadrill, Hariyama, Corviknight, Poliwrath, Wooper...
A5_4090_PIKACHU_100_6000	They’re not crossed out, so they must’ve already been\nsent here.
A5_4090_TIM_100_9000	After that, there’s some stuff about the cubes.
A5_4090_TIM_100_10000	“The specs of the controller utilized by Mr. Butler are\nhighly confidential.
A5_4090_TIM_100_11000	“In the interest of maintaining this confidentiality, we\ndestroyed the controller remotely to ensure the police\nwere only able to collect the broken remains.”
A5_4090_PIKACHU_100_7000	I see... So that’s why the controller broke the way it\ndid. They wanted to keep the police in the dark.
A5_4090_TIM_100_12000	If there was any doubt of Unitas’s involvement before,\nthis pretty much proves it.
A5_4090_PIKACHU_100_8000	Yeah—but I still wanna know more. Let’s take a\ncloser look.
A5_4090_TIM_200_1000	Let’s check out the stuff on the desk.
A5_4100_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, where should we start looking?
A5_4100_PIKACHU_200_1000	Is there anywhere you forgot to look?
A5_4110_PIKACHU_5000_1000	Hey, Tim. You haven’t investigated everything yet.
A5_4120_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s important to have a wide perspective\nwhen you’re looking for something.
A5_4120_PIKACHU_100_2000	Whenever you lost your toys as a kid,\nthat’s what you always did to find them.
A5_4130_TIM_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>Here’s an experiment report about the cubes.</color>
A5_4130_TIM_100_2000	It’s got a list of Pokémon that the cubes were\ntested on.
A5_4130_TIM_100_3000	Luxray, Liepard, Impidimp, Sableye, Pangoro...
A5_4130_PIKACHU_100_1000	Those are some of the Pokémon that were being\ndetained at the police station.
A5_4130_TIM_100_4000	The list goes on—Wooper, Dusknoir, Excadrill,\nPoliwrath, Hariyama, Corviknight...
A5_4130_PIKACHU_100_2000	The same Pokémon we saw in that other document.
A5_4130_TIM_100_5000	“At this time, we lack sufficient data on Pokémon\nfrom various regions.
A5_4130_TIM_100_6000	“Additional data from a greater diversity of species is\nrequired to fully optimize the product.”
A5_4130_PIKACHU_100_3000	They’re still planning to collect even more Pokémon!
A5_4140_TIM_100_1000	Here’s another document written by someone\nin Unitas.
A5_4140_TIM_100_2000	“Operations team, the details of your mission are\nas follows—”
A5_4140_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oooh, found some official orders, did ya?
A5_4140_TIM_100_3000	“Location: The Galar region.
A5_4140_TIM_100_4000	“Goal: To advance our research and the development\nof the cubes.
A5_4140_TIM_100_5000	“Details: Gather as many different species of ice\nPokémon as possible.”
A5_4140_PIKACHU_100_2000	So this is why Unitas brought back Darmanitan and\nthe others...
A5_4140_PIKACHU_100_3000	Can’t believe they got dragged here all the way\nfrom Galar...
A5_4140_TIM_100_6000	I hope all those Pokémon we met at the ruins are\ndoing OK...
A5_4140_PIKACHU_100_4000	They’ll be fine! They’ve got Gordon and Chris helping\nthem out!
A5_4150_TIM_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>This looks like a business report written by someone\nin Unitas.</color>
A5_4150_TIM_100_2000	“Mass production of the cubes has been completed\nwithout incident.
A5_4150_TIM_100_3000	“Our CEO, Mr. Howard Myers, is scheduled to arrive\non the last day of Pokémon Friendship Week for a\nfinal inspection.
A5_4150_TIM_100_4000	“The cubes are ready to be shipped pending the\ncompletion of this final inspection.”
A5_4150_TIM_100_5000	Mayor Myers is their CEO?
A5_4150_PIKACHU_100_1000	CEO means “Chief Executive Officer,” right? As in, \nthe one who’s calling all the shots?
A5_4150_PIKACHU_100_1500	You’re telling me he’s the head honcho of this entire\norganization?
A5_4150_RACHEL_100_1000	P...Papa’s the one running Unitas?!
A5_4150_RACHEL_100_2000	That can’t possibly be true...
A5_4150_PIKACHU_100_2000	Of all the things we could’ve learned about Howard,\nthis is the worst possible one...
A5_4160_TIM_100_1000	It’s some sort of key. It could help us get into a\nlocked room.
A5_4160_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, if we find any locked rooms, let’s try it out.
A5_4170_TIM_100_1000	It’s some internal orders within Unitas.
A5_4170_TIM_100_2000	“There’s water leaking from floor B3.
A5_4170_TIM_100_3000	“Mr. Merloch keeps his valuable research data on\nfloor B4.
A5_4170_TIM_100_4000	“It is imperative that this leak be repaired as quickly\nas possible.”
A5_4170_PIKACHU_100_1000	Sounds like Merloch does all his research on B4.
A5_4170_TIM_100_5000	I’m sure there’s some useful information there, but we\nstill don’t know how to get down there...
A5_4170_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s just keep a cool head and keep looking, Tim.
A5_4190_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like there’s nothing else to investigate here.
A5_4191_PIKACHU_100_1000	So, did we find any good info about Unitas?
A5_4191_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, I think we’ve got enough info to make some\ndeductions.
A5_4195_PIKACHU_100_1000	I sure didn’t expect to learn that Howard’s in charge\nof all of Unitas...
A5_4195_TIM_100_1000	What exactly is he planning to do with this\norganization?
A5_4195_PIKACHU_100_2000	I think I’ve got an idea.
A5_4195_PIKACHU_100_3000	Howard’s been pursuing policies related to managing\nPokémon, right?
A5_4195_TIM_100_2000	He must intend to use the cubes for that.
A5_4195_PIKACHU_100_4000	Yep, there’s really no other explanation.
A5_4195_RACHEL_100_1000	... ... ...
A5_4205_PIKACHU_100_1000	Must’ve been a shock to find out her dear old dad is\nthe head of Unitas.
A5_4205_TIM_100_1000	Yeah... I’m honestly not sure what to say to her...
A5_4205_RACHEL_100_1000	... ... ...
A5_4205_PIKACHU_100_2000	She probably just needs some space to think, Tim.\nI’m sure she’ll recover from the shock in her own time.
A5_4205_PIKACHU_100_3000	Let’s focus on something else for now.
A5_4205_TIM_100_2000	Yeah...
A5_4205_PIKACHU_100_4000	Oh! I almost forgot after the whole Howard reveal,\nbut there’s something else that’s bothering me...
A5_4205_TIM_100_3000	Yeah? What’s that?
A5_4205_PIKACHU_100_5000	That paper we read earlier that mentioned Butler...
A5_4205_PIKACHU_100_6000	Maybe we should focus on that.
A5_4210_RACHEL_100_1000	Papa... How could you do this...
A5_4210_TIM_100_1000	Rachel...
A5_4210_RACHEL_100_2000	Sorry—I’m good. Let’s go.
A5_4210_TIM_100_2000	OK...
A5_4210_RACHEL_200_1000	Papa... How could you do this...
A5_4220_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow?
A5_4220_PIKACHU_100_1000	You wanna know why anyone would do such\ncruel things? Hmm...
A5_4220_TIM_100_1000	I mean, I’m sure the mayor’s got his reasons...
A5_4220_TIM_100_2000	But we can’t let this continue.
A5_4220_GARDIE_100_2000	Gow!
A5_4220_GARDIE_200_1000	Gow?
A5_4220_PIKACHU_200_1000	You wanna know why anyone would do such\ncruel things, huh...
A5_4230_TIM_100_1000	You and your friends managed to escape from Unitas\nwhile their guard was down, right?
A5_4230_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Darma.
A5_4230_PIKACHU_100_1000	Darmanitan says the humans at the place where he\nand the others were kept didn’t seem to care much\nabout their jobs.
A5_4230_PIKACHU_100_2000	Apparently, that made it pretty easy for them\nto escape.
A5_4230_TIM_100_2000	I guess Unitas is full of all kinds of people...
A5_4230_TIM_200_1000	You and your friends managed to escape from Unitas\nwhile their guard was down, right?
A5_4230_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Darma.
A5_4240_RENTORAR_100_1000	Luxray...
A5_4240_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, that’s right.
A5_4240_PIKACHU_100_2000	You and I were both test subjects in their experiments.
A5_4240_RENTORAR_100_2000	Ray...
A5_4240_PIKACHU_100_3000	Oh, no doubt. We’re gonna bring ’em down HARD.
A5_4240_RENTORAR_200_1000	Luxray...
A5_4240_PIKACHU_200_1000	Yeah, that’s right.
A5_4240_PIKACHU_200_2000	You and I were both test subjects in their experiments.
A5_4250_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro...
A5_4250_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s pretty unhappy about the cubes being\nmass-produced already.
A5_4250_TIM_100_1000	They’ll probably start shipping them out soon...
A5_4250_TIM_100_2000	We have to do something before that happens!
A5_4250_GORONDA_100_2000	Goro.
A5_4250_GORONDA_200_1000	Goro...
A5_4250_PIKACHU_200_1000	He’s pretty unhappy about the cubes being\nmass-produced already.
A5_4260_TIM_100_1000	I wonder if the key we found will open this door...
A5_4260_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like it worked! Let’s check out what’s inside.
A5_4280_NYOROBON_100_1000	Rath!
A5_4280_TIM_100_1000	It’s a Poliwrath. Doesn’t look like it’s being controlled\nright now.
A5_4280_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Poliwrath. Why are you in here?
A5_4280_NYOROBON_100_2000	Rath... Lirath...
A5_4280_PIKACHU_100_2000	It was kidnapped outta the blue and brought here.\nIt really just wants to go back to its pond.
A5_4280_TIM_100_2000	Don't worry—we’ll make sure you get home. Just sit\ntight for a bit, OK?
A5_4280_PIKACHU_100_3000	Let’s hear what Poliwrath has to say. We might learn\nsomething useful.
A5_4280_PIKACHU_200_1000	You mind answering some questions, Poliwrath?
A5_4280_NYOROBON_200_1000	Rath!
A5_4280_SEL_0_1000	About you, Poliwrath...
A5_4280_SEL_0_2000	Why are you here?
A5_4280_NYOROBON_300_1000	Rath!
A5_4280_PIKACHU_300_1000	Unbeatable swimmer, huh? You sound pretty\nconfident of that!
A5_4280_TIM_300_1000	Too bad it’s got nowhere to swim here.
A5_4280_PIKACHU_300_2000	No kidding. It’s gotta be pretty stressed.
A5_4280_NYOROBON_300_2000	Rath! Poliwrath!
A5_4280_TIM_300_2000	Wh-whoa! Why’s it swinging its arms around\nlike that?!
A5_4280_PIKACHU_300_3000	Oh, it’s just showing us its favorite swimming stroke.\nI know, bud—you can’t wait to get back in the water.
A5_4280_PIKACHU_400_1000	How did you get here?
A5_4280_NYOROBON_400_1000	Rath...
A5_4280_PIKACHU_400_2000	You and Hariyama were flexin’ on each other when\nsome humans suddenly grabbed you?
A5_4280_PIKACHU_400_3000	That must’ve been the PPB.
A5_4280_TIM_400_1000	Now that you mention it, I’m pretty sure I’ve seen\nPoliwrath and Hariyama fighting in the city before.
A5_4280_NYOROBON_400_2000	Raaath!
A5_4280_TIM_400_2000	It looks pretty mad about something.
A5_4280_PIKACHU_400_4000	It’s upset because they don’t give it enough\nwater here.
A5_4280_TIM_400_3000	Just like with Wooper. These poor Pokémon...
A5_4285_ARMORGA_100_1000	Caw.
A5_4285_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, aren’t you the Corviknight that stole my hat?
A5_4285_ARMORGA_100_2000	Caw...
A5_4285_PIKACHU_100_2000	You don’t remember, but probably?
A5_4285_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hey, no apology necessary—I know it wasn’t your\nfault. You were probably being controlled by one of\nthose cubes.
A5_4285_PIKACHU_100_4000	Can you tell me a bit about that?
A5_4285_PIKACHU_200_1000	Tell me a little more.
A5_4285_ARMORGA_200_1000	Caw.
A5_4285_SEL_0_1000	About you, Corviknight...
A5_4285_SEL_0_2000	Why are you here?
A5_4285_ARMORGA_300_1000	Caw.
A5_4285_PIKACHU_300_1000	You’re such a good flyer that nothing in the sky can\nscare you, huh?
A5_4285_PIKACHU_300_2000	Heh. Yeah, you’re pretty terrifying when you’re flying\nat someone head on.
A5_4285_PIKACHU_300_3000	Trust me—I’m speaking from experience!
A5_4285_ARMORGA_300_2000	Caw...
A5_4285_PIKACHU_300_4000	Oh, er... I guess that’s kind of a sore subject, huh...
A5_4285_PIKACHU_300_5000	I’m really not blaming you for anything. Sorry I keep\nbringing it up.
A5_4285_PIKACHU_400_1000	Do you remember how they managed to bring\nyou here?
A5_4285_ARMORGA_400_1000	Caw.
A5_4285_PIKACHU_400_2000	I see. You went to sleep one day, and when you woke\nup, you were in a place you didn’t recognize.
A5_4285_ARMORGA_400_2000	Caw.
A5_4285_PIKACHU_400_3000	And that’s when they started controlling you with\nthe cube.
A5_4285_PIKACHU_400_4000	I’m serious, Corviknight—you didn’t do anything\nwrong. Don’t beat yourself up.
A5_4285_TIM_400_1000	Yeah. We’re gonna show the world who’s really at\nfault for all this!
A5_4290_TIM_100_1000	I wonder if the key we found will open this door...
A5_4290_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like it worked! Let’s check out what’s inside.
A5_4310_HARITEYAMA_100_1000	Hariya!
A5_4310_TIM_100_1000	Wow, Hariyama sure looks riled up.
A5_4310_PIKACHU_100_1000	No way, Hariyama! Don’t even THINK about it!
A5_4310_TIM_100_2000	Huh? What did it say?
A5_4310_PIKACHU_100_2000	It’s been searching for a sumo opponent.
A5_4310_TIM_100_3000	Huh... Yeah, I don’t know if you’re really suited for\nsumo. We don't really have time to find out, either.
A5_4310_PIKACHU_100_3000	Sorry, Hariyama. I’m sure you’ll find an opponent\neventually.
A5_4310_HARITEYAMA_100_2000	Harihari...
A5_4310_PIKACHU_200_1000	It’s not exactly sumo, but how do you feel about, er...\nwrestling with some questions?
A5_4310_HARITEYAMA_200_1000	Harihari!
A5_4310_SEL_0_1000	About you, Hariyama...
A5_4310_SEL_0_2000	Why are you here?
A5_4310_HARITEYAMA_300_1000	Hariya!
A5_4310_PIKACHU_300_1000	<color=#F39800FF>It says it loves testing its strength by sumo wrestling.</color>
A5_4310_TIM_300_1000	I bet Hariyama would get along really well with\nDarmanitan—but now’s not a great time for them\nto spar.
A5_4310_PIKACHU_300_2000	Yeah. If something happened to Darmanitan at this\npoint, we’d be in real trouble.
A5_4310_HARITEYAMA_300_2000	Harihari?
A5_4310_PIKACHU_300_3000	Sorry, Hariyama. Guess you win this round by default.
A5_4310_HARITEYAMA_400_1000	Harihari.
A5_4310_PIKACHU_400_1000	So you were brought here against your will too...
A5_4310_TIM_400_1000	I know that happened to a lot of the Pokémon here,\nbut I’m surprised they were able to subdue Hariyama.
A5_4310_PIKACHU_400_2000	You’re assuming Unitas played fair.
A5_4310_HARITEYAMA_400_2000	Harihari...
A5_4310_PIKACHU_400_3000	Apparently they grabbed it while it was in the middle\nof a standoff with Poliwrath.
A5_4310_TIM_400_2000	I see...
A5_4310_HARITEYAMA_400_3000	Hariyaaa!
A5_4310_PIKACHU_400_4000	It’s been stomping on the floor every day as part of its\ntraining, but at some point the floor started cracking.
A5_4310_PIKACHU_400_5000	Believe it or not, Hariyama, I’m pretty sure those\ncracks are all you.
A5_4310_TIM_400_3000	Wow. It’s really strong!
A5_4330_TIM_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>Looks like the floor’s been weakened here.</color>
A5_4330_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oooh, I can just barely see the floor below through\nthese cracks.
A5_4330_TIM_100_3000	If we have Darmanitan use its strength to widen these\ncracks, we might be able to get down there.
A5_4330_PIKACHU_100_2000	And risk the whole floor caving in? I don’t think so.
A5_4330_TIM_100_4000	Hmm, fair point... Darmanitan doesn’t exactly have a\nlight touch.
A5_4330_PIKACHU_100_3000	Still, I think it’s a good idea to ask a Pokémon for\nhelp here.
A5_4330_TIM_200_1000	The floor’s been weakened here.
A5_4330_TIM_200_2000	We might be able to break through and reach the\nfloor below.
A5_4340_PIKACHU_100_1000	I don’t think there’s anything else for us to investigate\nin the detainment rooms...
A5_4340_TIM_100_1000	And we didn’t find a passcode or a card key...
A5_4340_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’ll never get downstairs at this rate!
A5_4340_PIKACHU_100_3000	We’ll have to think of another way.
A5_4345_PIKACHU_400_1000	Are there any Pokémon left that we haven’t talked\nto yet?
A5_4345_PIKACHU_400_2000	Let’s see what they have to say.
A5_4345_PIKACHU_600_1000	There might be a clue somewhere that’ll help us find\na way downstairs.
A5_4345_PIKACHU_600_2000	Let’s be as thorough as we can with this set of rooms.
A5_4350_TIM_100_1000	We need to ask Excadrill to dig a hole through the\nfloor for us.
A5_4350_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, let’s go ask right now!
A5_4350_PIKACHU_100_2000	Anyway, that’s the situation. Think you can help\nus, Excadrill?
A5_4350_DORYUZU_100_1000	Drill!
A5_4350_PIKACHU_100_3000	It says it’s the least it can do.
A5_4350_TIM_100_2000	I’m so glad it’ll help.
A5_4350_LHENEMYDARK01_100_1000	Heeeyyy! Cramoraaant!!!
A5_4350_LHENEMYDARK01_100_2000	Give that controller baaack!!!
A5_4350_TIM_100_3000	Did you hear that voice?!
A5_4350_PIKACHU_100_4000	It’s one of those Unitas grunts.
A5_4350_PIKACHU_100_5000	They’ll probably come in here too. We better hurry.
A5_4350_PIKACHU_100_6000	Think you can start digging right away, Excadrill?
A5_4350_DORYUZU_100_2000	Dridrill!
A5_4350_TIM_100_4000	I’ll go get everyone else!
A5_4350_PIKACHU_100_7000	Thanks, Tim.
A5_4390_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wow, you dug that hole in no time!
A5_4390_DORYUZU_100_1000	Driiill!
A5_4390_PIKACHU_100_2000	We really appreciate it, Excadrill! Thanks to you, we\ncan finally get down to B4.
A5_4390_TIM_100_1000	What about Excadrill and the others, though?
A5_4390_PIKACHU_100_3000	Oh yeah, good point... Excadrill, you should get\noutta here.
A5_4390_PIKACHU_100_4000	Just keep heading up. With your skills, I’m sure you’ll\nbe able to escape this place.
A5_4390_DORYUZU_100_2000	Drill!
A5_4390_PIKACHU_100_5000	And sorry to stack on the favors, but please take the\nother Pokémon with you.
A5_4390_PIKACHU_100_6000	Oh! And would you find Wooper, Dusknoir, and any\nothers from the upper floors too?
A5_4390_DORYUZU_100_3000	Dridrill!
A5_4390_UU_100_1000	Cram?
A5_4390_PIKACHU_100_7000	Yeah, you go with Excadrill too, Cramorant—and\ndon’t let Unitas catch you this time!
A5_4390_UU_100_2000	Cramorant!
A5_4390_DORYUZU_100_4000	Drill!
A5_4390_TIM_100_2000	Thanks, Excadrill!
A5_4390_PIKACHU_100_8000	Yeah, I hope we meet again someday!
A5_4390_TIM_100_3000	OK, the rest of us should head down. Are you good\nto keep going, Rachel?
A5_4390_RACHEL_100_1000	Yeah. I’ve come this far, after all.
A5_4390_RACHEL_100_2000	And I need to stop Papa—whatever it takes!
A5_4390_TIM_100_4000	Right. Just don’t push yourself too hard.
A5_4390_RACHEL_100_3000	Thanks, Tim.
A5_4390_PIKACHU_100_9000	All right, then! It’s about time we get a move on!
A5_4390_PIKACHU_100_10000	We’ve got no idea what’s waiting for us down there,\nso keep your eyes peeled!
A5_4390_PIKACHU_100_11000	Come on, everyone! Through the hole!
A5_4420_PIKACHU_100_1000	Did everyone make it down safely?
A5_4420_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow!
A5_4420_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar!
A5_4420_TIM_100_1000	I don’t see anyone from Unitas here now.
A5_4420_PIKACHU_100_2000	They must’ve all gone down to the bottom floor, B5.
A5_4420_PIKACHU_100_3000	Oh, look! A floor map! Let’s check it out.
A5_4420_PIKACHU_100_4000	OK, so the door on the right leads down a hallway\nto some stairs, and the door on the left leads to some\nstorage rooms and the elevator.
A5_4420_TIM_100_2000	But it looks like we can’t pass through the storage\nrooms. It says they’re packed full of crates.
A5_4420_PIKACHU_100_5000	Then I guess we’ve gotta use the stairs to get down\nto B5.
A5_4420_TIM_100_3000	Which means we just need to open that door on\nthe right.
A5_4420_TIM_100_4000	But...it says here that we need a card key to open the\ndoors on this floor.
A5_4420_PIKACHU_100_6000	A card key instead of a passcode this time?\nThe security on this floor’s the tightest yet!
A5_4420_TIM_100_5000	Yeah. It won’t be easy, but we’ve gotta find that\ncard key.
A5_4420_TIM_100_6000	Now that I get a better look around, there sure are a\nlot of desks on this floor.
A5_4420_PIKACHU_100_7000	According to the map we saw on B1, this floor’s\nused by the research team.
A5_4420_TIM_100_7000	Oh yeah, it said that on the orders we saw\nearlier, too.
A5_4420_TIM_100_8000	They said that Merloch’s research data was stored on\nthis floor.
A5_4420_PIKACHU_100_8000	I guess that room in the middle is Merloch’s personal\nresearch lab.
A5_4420_TIM_100_9000	We might be able to learn more about Unitas’s\nresearch if we have a look around.
A5_4420_RACHEL_100_1000	True...
A5_4420_TIM_100_10000	Are you OK, Rachel? You’re looking kinda pale...
A5_4420_RACHEL_100_2000	Oh, it’s just...knowing we might run into Papa soon is\nmaking me nervous.
A5_4420_RACHEL_100_3000	He’s been leading Unitas this whole time, and they’re\nthe ones conducting research with those cubes...
A5_4420_RACHEL_100_4000	What can I even say to him?
A5_4420_RACHEL_100_5000	What would help him to understand?
A5_4420_PIKACHU_100_9000	This must be really tough for Rachel.
A5_4420_TIM_100_11000	I’m not sure exactly what you should say to\nyour dad...
A5_4420_TIM_100_12000	But I do think you should be honest with him\nabout how you feel.
A5_4420_TIM_100_13000	That’s what’s most important.
A5_4420_RACHEL_100_6000	Yeah...you could be right. Thanks, Tim.
A5_4420_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux.
A5_4420_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro.
A5_4420_PIKACHU_100_10000	They said they’re gonna go over there and keep\nwatch.
A5_4420_TIM_100_14000	Thanks. That’s a big help.
A5_4435_TIM_100_1000	Getting weaker? Hang on...
A5_4435_TIM_100_2000	You mean Pikachu could disappear entirely, like\nMewtwo said?
A5_4435_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s right.
A5_4435_PIKACHU_100_2000	Now that I’ve got my memories back, I’m basically\nHarry in everything but appearance.
A5_4435_PIKACHU_100_3000	And the clearer my own consciousness becomes, the\nmore Pikachu’s fades away...
A5_4435_TIM_100_3000	This is bad. We can’t just let Pikachu disappear.
A5_4435_TIM_100_4000	We’ve gotta get your body back fast—for both your\nsakes!
A5_4435_PIKACHU_100_4000	You got that right.
A5_4435_PIKACHU_100_5000	Hmm? What’s this?
A5_4435_TIM_100_5000	What is it?
A5_4435_PIKACHU_100_6000	There’s something stuck to my foot. Let’s see...
A5_4435_TIM_100_6000	Looks like some orders addressed to the operations\nteam.
A5_4435_TIM_100_7000	“Proceed immediately to Jessica Miller’s location.
A5_4435_TIM_100_8000	“Find her at the pizzeria in Bamboo Borough.
A5_4435_TIM_100_9000	“Capture the Sleeping Man discovered in\nMewtwo’s cave.”
A5_4435_PIKACHU_100_7000	So the guy who attacked Jessica got his orders\nfrom here.
A5_4435_TIM_100_10000	But what’s this about a “Sleeping Man”?
A5_4435_PIKACHU_100_8000	Oh, I’m pretty sure they’re talking about my body.
A5_4435_TIM_100_11000	Hey, Pikachu... You think Dad’s body is close?
A5_4435_PIKACHU_100_9000	Yeah. The feeling’s stronger here than on any of the\nother floors so far.
A5_4435_TIM_100_12000	So it might be down on the lowest floor, B5?
A5_4435_PIKACHU_100_10000	Yeah, that’s what I’m guessing. Anyway...let’s keep\ninvestigating.
A5_4440_RACHEL_100_1000	Sorry about earlier.
A5_4440_RACHEL_100_2000	I thought I was more prepared for all this...
A5_4440_TIM_100_1000	It’s totally OK. Are you feeling a bit better now?
A5_4440_RACHEL_100_3000	Yeah—thanks to you, Tim.
A5_4440_RACHEL_100_4000	I just need to find Papa and talk to him.
A5_4440_RACHEL_100_5000	There must be a way to get down to floor B5.\nLet’s look around.
A5_4440_TIM_100_2000	Yeah. I want to investigate some things on this\nfloor too.
A5_4440_RACHEL_100_6000	Let’s get to it, then! I’m sure we’ll find something.
A5_4440_RACHEL_200_1000	Let’s get to it! I’m sure we’ll find something.
A5_4440_TIM_200_1000	Right. Let’s split up and search.
A5_4450_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow gow!
A5_4450_TIM_100_1000	She seems even more enthusiastic since we ran\ninto Cramorant.
A5_4450_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah. She wants to thank us for rescuing him by\nhelping us out.
A5_4450_PIKACHU_100_2000	Growlithe still considers Cramorant an important part\nof her family.
A5_4450_PIKACHU_100_3000	She’s been wondering what happened to him this\nwhole time.
A5_4450_TIM_100_2000	I guess her feelings haven’t changed, then, even after\neverything that’s happened.
A5_4450_GARDIE_100_2000	Gow gow!
A5_4450_PIKACHU_100_4000	Haha! I get it, I get it—you’re raring to go!
A5_4450_PIKACHU_100_5000	In that case, can you keep watch and make sure no\nUnitas goons come down through this hole?
A5_4450_PIKACHU_100_6000	This is really important, Growlithe. Can you handle it?
A5_4450_GARDIE_100_3000	Gow!
A5_4450_PIKACHU_200_1000	We’re counting on you to keep watch here, Growlithe.
A5_4450_GARDIE_200_1000	Gow!
A5_4460_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dar!
A5_4460_PIKACHU_100_1000	Whoa! What’s got you so worked up, Darmanitan?
A5_4460_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Darma manitan!
A5_4460_PIKACHU_100_2000	Mmm. Seeing Poliwrath and the others brought back\nmemories of what happened to you, huh.
A5_4460_GHIHIDARUMA_100_3000	Dardar!
A5_4460_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yeah, what they’re doing is definitely wrong.
A5_4460_PIKACHU_100_4000	That’s why we’re here to stop them.
A5_4460_GHIHIDARUMA_100_4000	Dar!
A5_4460_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Dar!
A5_4460_PIKACHU_200_1000	Don’t worry—we’re definitely gonna take ’em down.
A5_4470_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux.
A5_4470_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’re keeping watch to make sure Unitas doesn’t\nfind us, huh?
A5_4470_RENTORAR_100_2000	Ray.
A5_4470_PIKACHU_100_2000	Knowing the situation upstairs is definitely useful...\nbut doesn’t using your special vision for so long tire\nyou out?
A5_4470_RENTORAR_100_3000	Lux.
A5_4470_PIKACHU_100_3000	Well, OK then. Let us know if you see anything,\nbut don't wear yourself out.
A5_4470_RENTORAR_200_1000	Ray.
A5_4470_PIKACHU_200_1000	Let us know if you notice anything.
A5_4480_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro.
A5_4480_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, someone from Unitas could show up here at\nany moment.
A5_4480_PIKACHU_100_2000	We’ve gotta proceed carefully.
A5_4480_GORONDA_100_2000	Goro!
A5_4480_PIKACHU_100_3000	You’ll hold ’em back just like you did at the\npolice station?
A5_4480_GORONDA_100_3000	Gorooo!
A5_4480_PIKACHU_100_4000	Thanks, Pangoro. You’re a huge help.
A5_4480_PIKACHU_200_1000	It’s up to you to handle anyone who shows\nup, Pangoro.
A5_4480_GORONDA_200_1000	Gorogoro!
A5_4490_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s a map of this floor.
A5_4490_PIKACHU_100_2000	The door on the right leads to the stairs, and the\none on the left leads to some storage rooms and\nthe elevator.
A5_4490_TIM_100_1000	It says you can’t get through the rooms on the left\n’cause they’re packed full of crates.
A5_4490_PIKACHU_100_3000	I guess we’ve gotta take the stairs to get to B5, then.
A5_4490_TIM_100_2000	The sign says that both doors require a card key to\nopen them.
A5_4490_PIKACHU_100_4000	And the middle room is apparently Merloch’s\npersonal research lab.
A5_4490_TIM_100_3000	There might be some important info in there about\nthe cubes—or about Dad’s body.
A5_4490_PIKACHU_100_5000	Agreed. Let’s check it out.
A5_4490_PIKACHU_200_1000	It’s a map of this floor.
A5_4490_TIM_200_1000	The sign says that the left and right doors require a\ncard key to open them.
A5_4500_TIM_100_1000	Apparently we need a card key to open this door.
A5_4500_PIKACHU_100_1000	There might be one in this room somewhere.\nLet’s look.
A5_4510_TIM_100_1000	Apparently we need a card key to open this door.
A5_4510_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, we read that the other side of this door is\nblocked with too much stuff to get through anyway.
A5_4520_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s a bunch of gears here, but there’s also an\nopen space in the middle.
A5_4520_TIM_100_1000	It seems to be missing some gears.
A5_4520_PIKACHU_100_2000	Guess it’s undergoing maintenance.
A5_4520_TIM_200_1000	It seems to be missing some gears.
A5_4520_PIKACHU_200_1000	Guess it’s undergoing maintenance.
A5_4525_TIM_100_1000	This door won’t budge...
A5_4525_PIKACHU_100_1000	No point in brooding about it here. Let’s look around\nsomewhere else.
A5_4530_PIKACHU_100_1000	This must be a Unitas researcher’s desk.
A5_4530_TIM_100_1000	There’s a note here.
A5_4530_TIM_100_2000	“From the research team to the management team:\nOrders from the CTO
A5_4530_TIM_100_3000	“Obtain the data from Jessica Miller, a resident of\nBamboo Borough.
A5_4530_TIM_100_4000	“You are to notify the operations team to carry out\nthese orders immediately.”
A5_4530_PIKACHU_100_2000	CTO, huh... So these instructions are from the Chief\nTechnology Officer.
A5_4530_RACHEL_100_1000	How do they think they can get away with treating\npeople like this?!
A5_4530_TIM_100_5000	Let’s see if we can find any more information.
A5_4530_TIM_200_1000	It’s a note with orders to target Jessica.
A5_4530_RACHEL_200_1000	How do they think they can get away with treating\npeople like this?!
A5_4530_TIM_200_2000	Let’s see if we can find any more information.
A5_4540_TIM_100_1000	There are a bunch of tools on this desk.
A5_4540_RACHEL_100_1000	Maybe they’re used for building and fixing the cubes.
A5_4540_TIM_100_2000	There’s a lot of different stuff. Let’s take a closer look.
A5_4540_PIKACHU_200_1000	There’s a bunch of different stuff here. What do you\nwanna check out?
A5_4540_SEL_0_1000	Toolbox
A5_4540_SEL_0_2000	Ticket to the management team
A5_4540_SEL_0_3000	Note from the CTO
A5_4540_PIKACHU_300_1000	Screwdrivers, an oil can...and a whole lot of\nother tools.
A5_4540_TIM_300_1000	There’s even a blowtorch.
A5_4540_RACHEL_300_1000	Careful not to burn yourself!
A5_4540_TIM_400_1000	Here’s a ticket submitted for the management team.\nLooks like it’s from the research team.
A5_4540_TIM_400_2000	“Floor B4: Issue with CTO’s lab door
A5_4540_TIM_400_3000	“Status: Card keys are recognized, but the door will\nnot open or close.
A5_4540_TIM_400_4000	“Upon inspection, it appears that some of the door’s\ngears are broken.
A5_4540_TIM_400_5000	“We have removed the broken gears and requested\nurgent assistance.”
A5_4540_RACHEL_400_1000	The lab door’s not working? That’s the one at the\ncenter of this floor, right?
A5_4540_PIKACHU_400_1000	Yeah. Sounds like the new parts haven’t come in yet.
A5_4540_TIM_500_1000	Here are some instructions to the research team from\nthe CTO of Unitas.
A5_4540_PIKACHU_500_1000	CTO... That’s Unitas’s Chief Technology Officer.
A5_4540_TIM_500_2000	Looks like it was written in a hurry. It’s kinda hard to\nread, but I’ll do my best.
A5_4540_TIM_500_3000	“The Control Cubes currently in operation are\neffective on nearly all Pokémon.
A5_4540_TIM_500_4000	“However, they are not completely effective on\nRock-type Pokémon.
A5_4540_TIM_500_5000	“The cubes must be updated to address this flaw.
A5_4540_TIM_500_6000	“This would be a simple task were I to handle it\nmyself, but I have other, more pressing work to\nattend to.
A5_4540_TIM_500_7000	“The research team should consider this its most\ncritical mission.
A5_4540_TIM_500_8000	“Prioritize refining the effectiveness of the Control\nCubes at all costs—even if it increases the strain the\ncubes inflict upon Pokémon’s bodies.”
A5_4540_TIM_500_9000	That Unitas guy in Bamboo Borough was controlling\na Rock-type Pokémon no problem, though...
A5_4540_PIKACHU_500_2000	They must’ve upgraded the cubes.
A5_4540_RACHEL_500_1000	I can’t believe they were using Pokémon like tools,\nall while knowingly making them suffer!
A5_4540_PIKACHU_500_3000	Took the words right outta my mouth.
A5_4550_TIM_100_1000	This must be a researcher’s desk.
A5_4550_PIKACHU_100_1000	Notebooks and memos, eh? Sorry, whoever-you-are,\nbut I’m about to look through all your stuff.
A5_4550_PIKACHU_200_1000	Is there anywhere you’ve forgotten to look?
A5_4550_SEL_0_1000	Diary on the resumption of research
A5_4550_SEL_0_2000	Note about the “Sleeping Man”
A5_4550_SEL_0_3000	Orders addressed to the operations team
A5_4550_PIKACHU_300_1000	This looks like a diary.
A5_4550_PIKACHU_300_2000	I can’t make heads or tails of any of this scientific\njargon, though.
A5_4550_TIM_300_1000	Wait—look at this entry from last year.
A5_4550_TIM_300_2000	“I received word from Mayor Myers that work has\nresumed at the Pokémon Unity Lab.
A5_4550_TIM_300_3000	“They’ll be continuing Emma’s research on mutual\nunderstanding between humans and Pokémon...
A5_4550_TIM_300_4000	“...both through speech and the direct sharing of\nconsciousnesses.
A5_4550_TIM_300_5000	“If this is successfully achieved, Ryme City will become\nan even safer and more pleasant place to live.
A5_4550_TIM_300_6000	“The new organization takes its name from Emma’s\nfinal project:
A5_4550_TIM_300_7000	“Unitas.
A5_4550_TIM_300_8000	“I’ve decided to join Unitas myself.
A5_4550_TIM_300_9000	“This research will benefit countless people. As a\nresearcher, I expect this to be very fulfilling work.”
A5_4550_RACHEL_300_1000	So Papa’s the one who named this organization\n“Unitas.”
A5_4550_TIM_300_10000	This researcher seems really proud to be part of it.
A5_4550_RACHEL_300_2000	How can they find this work “fulfilling” when they’re\nmaking Pokémon suffer?
A5_4550_PIKACHU_300_3000	There’s gotta be a side to this story we’re not seeing.
A5_4550_PIKACHU_400_1000	What’s this document?
A5_4550_TIM_400_1000	Let me see...
A5_4550_TIM_400_2000	Whoa, look at the title—“Investigation report of the\nSleeping Man found in Mewtwo’s cave”!
A5_4550_PIKACHU_400_2000	Wha—?! That’s a report about my body!
A5_4550_RACHEL_400_1000	What does it say?
A5_4550_TIM_400_3000	I’ll read it out.
A5_4550_TIM_400_4000	“After bringing the Sleeping Man back to the lab, we\napplied electric shocks and other external stimuli in\nan attempt to wake him—but to no avail.
A5_4550_TIM_400_5000	“Based on his condition, we believe the subject has\nbeen asleep for quite some time.
A5_4550_TIM_400_6000	“An electrocardiogram and various blood tests all\nreturned results within the expected range for an\nadult human male.
A5_4550_TIM_400_7000	“The only anomaly we’ve observed in the subject is\nhis brainwaves, which occasionally exhibit irregular\nbehavior.
A5_4550_TIM_400_8000	“However, these irregularities are not significant\nenough to warrant any great concern and do not\nseem to be negatively affecting his body.
A5_4550_TIM_400_9000	“Though the Sleeping Man has not consumed any\nfood while under our observation, his muscle mass\nshows no signs of atrophy.
A5_4550_TIM_400_10000	“Our working hypothesis is that the energy within his\nbody is maintaining his current condition.”
A5_4550_RACHEL_400_2000	I guess that means your dad’s just sleeping, and he’s\nstill totally healthy?
A5_4550_PIKACHU_400_3000	That’s gotta be thanks to Mewtwo... Honestly, I’m just\nhappy to hear I’m still alive.
A5_4550_TIM_400_11000	And no worse for wear, either, which is a huge relief.
A5_4550_TIM_400_12000	Plus, now we have confirmation that your body’s here\nin this lab.
A5_4550_PIKACHU_400_4000	I guess that feeling I had was right on the money.
A5_4550_TIM_400_13000	Yeah. All that’s left is to find that body of yours!
A5_4550_TIM_500_1000	Looks like the management team posted some orders\nfor the operations team.
A5_4550_PIKACHU_500_1000	Go ahead and read ’em.
A5_4550_TIM_500_2000	“Location: Bamboo Borough\nTarget: Jessica Miller
A5_4550_TIM_500_3000	“Objective: Retrieve the thumb drive”
A5_4550_PIKACHU_500_2000	This is about what happened in Bamboo Borough...
A5_4550_TIM_500_4000	“It is imperative that the thumb drive is secured.\nThis is a direct order from our CTO...”
A5_4550_RACHEL_500_1000	Tim...? What is it? Why did you stop reading?
A5_4550_TIM_500_5000	It says here that Unitas’s CTO is...Mr. Merloch.
A5_4550_PIKACHU_500_3000	What?! That guy’s the Chief Technology Officer?!
A5_4550_TIM_500_6000	So the mayor’s the CEO, and Merloch’s the CTO...
A5_4550_RACHEL_500_2000	Papa and Merloch lead this organization together?!\nBut why...?
A5_4550_TIM_500_7000	<color=#F39800FF>There’s a map of Bamboo Borough attached to this\ndocument.</color>
A5_4550_PIKACHU_500_4000	They really put a lot of preparation into that attack\non Jessica.
A5_4555_PIKACHU_100_1000	Seems like Jessica was an important target\nfor Unitas...
A5_4555_TIM_100_1000	Yeah—especially considering the order came directly\nfrom Merloch, the CTO.
A5_4555_PIKACHU_100_2000	I wonder why they were after her, though.
A5_4560_PIKACHU_100_1000	What are these papers? Those diagrams look like\nbrain waves or something.
A5_4560_TIM_100_1000	I think they’re reports about the cube experiments.\nLook at what it says here:
A5_4560_TIM_100_2000	“The Pokémon test subjects experienced extreme\nfatigue after the cubes were attached.
A5_4560_TIM_100_3000	“Irregular fluctuations in their brain waves were also\nobserved.
A5_4560_TIM_100_4000	“The negative effects of the cubes on the physical\nhealth of Pokémon seem rather significant.”
A5_4560_RACHEL_100_1000	No... How could Papa allow this?!
A5_4560_PIKACHU_100_2000	We need to figure out what Howard’s thinking.
A5_4560_PIKACHU_200_1000	It’s nothing but reports about the cube experiments.\nI don’t think there’s any other info we can use here.
A5_4560_RACHEL_200_1000	I can’t believe Papa would agree to\nthese experiments...
A5_4560_TIM_200_1000	Let’s...search somewhere else.
A5_4570_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s a voice recorder on the desk.
A5_4570_TIM_100_1000	Looks like there’s a recording on it, too.
A5_4570_PIKACHU_100_2000	Well, let’s hear it.
A5_4570_RESEARCHER02_100_1000	“I wanna try out the voice recorder they gave me.”
A5_4570_RESEARCHER01_100_1000	“They’re supposed to be for keeping research notes.\nDo you really think recording casual conversation like\nthis is OK?”
A5_4570_RESEARCHER02_100_2000	“Why not? It’s not like anyone else is gonna listen\nto this.
A5_4570_RESEARCHER02_100_3000	“By the way, remember when Mr. Myers stopped by\nrecently? Hadn’t seen him around here for a while.”
A5_4570_RESEARCHER01_100_2000	“I think he had a meeting with Mr. Merloch. I’d love\nto know what they were discussing.”
A5_4570_RESEARCHER02_100_4000	“Oh yeah? Well, lucky for you, I sat in on that\nmeeting to keep minutes.
A5_4570_RESEARCHER02_100_5000	“I heard what Mr. Myers had to say, and you know...\nthere was something off about it.”
A5_4570_RESEARCHER01_100_3000	“Oh? How so?”
A5_4570_RESEARCHER02_100_6000	“Mr. Merloch made the cubes, y’know? So the mayor\nis putting his complete trust in him now.”
A5_4570_RESEARCHER01_100_4000	“Isn’t that...good?”
A5_4570_RESEARCHER02_100_7000	“I guess, but...I dunno. It’s the way Mr. Myers said it.
A5_4570_RESEARCHER02_100_8000	“He was like, ‘We need the cubes so a disaster like\nthe R incident can NEVER happen again!’
A5_4570_RESEARCHER02_100_9000	“He was seriously worked up—practically shouting,\nin fact.
A5_4570_RESEARCHER02_100_10000	“Which I guess is understandable, considering he lost\nhis wife, Emma, in the R incident.”
A5_4570_RESEARCHER01_100_5000	“Yeah. I never met her, but I heard she was a truly\ngifted researcher.”
A5_4570_RESEARCHER02_100_11000	“Same. Plus, the mayor’s got a daughter.
A5_4570_RESEARCHER02_100_12000	“He’s just trying to keep her safe and make sure what\nhappened to Emma doesn’t happen to her too.
A5_4570_RESEARCHER02_100_13000	“He literally said, ‘I will do ANYTHING to protect\nmy daughter.’”
A5_4570_RESEARCHER01_100_6000	“Family man, huh? Respect.”
A5_4570_RESEARCHER02_100_14000	“Sure, but even so...
A5_4570_RESEARCHER02_100_15000	“The intense look on his face... You should’ve seen it.\nI mean, I was legitimately terrified of him.”
A5_4570_RACHEL_100_1000	Papa...
A5_4570_PIKACHU_100_3000	He sounds like a good father—but all this stuff with\nthe cubes is misguided.
A5_4570_TIM_100_2000	How are you doing, Rachel? I know this must be hard.
A5_4570_RACHEL_100_2000	I’m...I’m fine. I just need to talk to my dad face\nto face.
A5_4570_PIKACHU_200_1000	I don’t see anything noteworthy beyond that\nvoice recorder.
A5_4570_PIKACHU_200_2000	Let’s search somewhere else.
A5_4580_TIM_100_1000	Looks like someone’s in the middle of building\na computer.
A5_4580_PIKACHU_100_1000	I don’t see anything else unusual...
A5_4580_SECRETGIARU_100_1000	Kli-klink...
A5_4580_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hm? Did you hear something just now, Tim?
A5_4580_TIM_100_2000	Huh? No, I didn’t.
A5_4580_PIKACHU_100_3000	Hmmm. Never mind, then, I guess.
A5_4590_TIM_100_1000	I don’t see Dad’s body or Mayor Myers around here.
A5_4590_PIKACHU_100_1000	Same. I wanna investigate the room in the back, but\nthe door isn’t working.
A5_4590_TIM_100_2000	What should we do?
A5_4590_SECRETGIARU_100_1000	Kli... Klikiki!
A5_4590_PIKACHU_100_2000	Wait, what was that?!
A5_4590_TIM_100_3000	I heard it too. It came from that half-assembled\ncomputer.
A5_4590_PIKACHU_100_3000	Let’s check it out, Tim!
A5_4620_SECRETGIARU_100_1000	Kli kliii!
A5_4620_PIKACHU_100_1000	Whoa! There’s some kinda Pokémon inside the\ncomputer!
A5_4620_TIM_100_1000	What?! I can’t see inside—is it OK?
A5_4620_SECRETGIARU_100_2000	Kli li.
A5_4620_PIKACHU_100_2000	It says it found the perfect little gap to wedge itself\ninto and take a nap.
A5_4620_TIM_100_2000	A nap, huh? It sounds pretty relaxed.
A5_4620_RACHEL_100_1000	A surprising number of Pokémon seem to prefer\ntight spaces.
A5_4620_SECRETGIARU_100_3000	Kliii?
A5_4620_PIKACHU_100_3000	It’s wondering if its partner has returned yet.
A5_4620_TIM_100_3000	Who’s its partner?
A5_4620_SECRETGIARU_100_4000	Kli! Kli li link!
A5_4620_PIKACHU_100_4000	A researcher here, apparently. They must’ve gone to a\ndifferent floor to do some work.
A5_4620_PIKACHU_100_5000	This Pokémon says it’s been napping while it waits for\nits partner to return.
A5_4620_PIKACHU_100_6000	Sorry, buddy. Your partner’s not back yet.
A5_4620_SECRETGIARU_100_5000	Kli kli!
A5_4620_PIKACHU_100_6500	Why don’t you go look for them, then?
A5_4620_SECRETGIARU_100_5500	Kliii!
A5_4620_PIKACHU_100_7000	Ohhh, I get it. You’re stuck.
A5_4620_TIM_100_4000	Uh-oh. Is it OK?
A5_4620_PIKACHU_100_8000	I think so. Doesn’t sound like it’s in any pain...
A5_4620_SECRETGIARU_100_6000	Kli.
A5_4620_RACHEL_100_2000	It sounds sad, though...
A5_4620_TIM_100_5000	We can’t just leave it like this.
A5_4620_PIKACHU_100_9000	I guess we may as well help, since we’re here and all.
A5_4620_PIKACHU_100_10000	It’s really wedged in there, though. I don’t think we\ncan just yank it out.
A5_4620_TIM_100_6000	We probably need some sort of tool.
A5_4620_PIKACHU_100_11000	Didn’t we pass by a desk with some tools on it?\nLet’s grab one of ’em!
A5_4630_SECRETGIARU_100_1000	Kliii! Kli liii!
A5_4630_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yep—it’s still stuck.
A5_4630_TIM_100_1000	We better hurry up and find those tools.
A5_4640_PIKACHU_100_1000	Ah, there we go! That’s the toolbox we’re looking for!
A5_4640_TIM_100_1000	An oil can, some screwdrivers, a blowtorch... Lots\nof options.
A5_4640_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s take ’em all with us and get that Pokémon\nunstuck from the computer.
A5_4650_PIKACHU_100_1000	The Pokémon inside this computer is stuck.
A5_4650_SECRETGIARU_100_1000	Kliii!
A5_4650_RACHEL_100_1000	Careful! If you keep trying so hard to get out, you\ncould really hurt yourself!
A5_4650_SECRETGIARU_100_2000	Kli li...
A5_4650_PIKACHU_100_2000	Well, Tim? Think we can use one of these tools to\nrescue this Pokémon?
A5_4650_TIM_100_1000	I’ll think of something. We can’t just leave it in there...
A5_4650_SEL_0_1000	Blowtorch
A5_4650_SEL_0_2000	Oil can
A5_4650_SEL_0_3000	Screwdriver
A5_4650_TIM_300_1000	We could use this blowtorch to melt the metal around\nthe Pokémon so it can free itself.
A5_4650_RACHEL_300_1000	What?! No! You’d burn the Pokémon too!
A5_4650_PIKACHU_300_1000	I gotta agree with Rachel on this one, Tim. Let’s try\nto find a safer solution.
A5_4650_TIM_300_2000	Hmm, OK. I’ll try a different approach.
A5_4650_TIM_400_1000	Maybe we can help it with this oil can.
A5_4650_PIKACHU_400_1000	Hey, yeah! You can use the oil to help it slide out!
A5_4650_SECRETGIARU_400_1000	Kli li?
A5_4650_TIM_400_2000	Heads up in there—I’m gonna pour some oil in.
A5_4650_PIKACHU_400_2000	All right, it should be a lot easier to slip out now!
A5_4650_PIKACHU_400_3000	Well? Think you can get out now?
A5_4650_SECRETGIARU_400_2000	Kli kiii!
A5_4650_TIM_500_1000	I could try to pry the Pokémon out with a screwdriver.
A5_4650_PIKACHU_500_1000	By sticking the screwdriver in through the gap, you\nmean? I guess it COULD work...
A5_4650_TIM_500_2000	I’ll give it a try. Ngh—!
A5_4650_SECRETGIARU_500_1000	Kliii?
A5_4650_TIM_500_3000	Hmm... No luck. It’s really stuck in there.
A5_4650_PIKACHU_500_2000	Which means we’ve gotta do something to get it\nUN-stuck.
A5_4670_TIM_100_1000	Ah, there was a Klink inside!
A5_4670_GIARU_100_1000	Kli ki!
A5_4670_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thanks for getting you out of there? Heh, forget\nabout it! It was nothin’.
A5_4670_PIKACHU_100_2000	Anyway, sorry to jump right in, but mind if we ask a\nfew questions, Klink?
A5_4670_GIARU_100_2000	Kli li.
A5_4670_PIKACHU_200_1000	Got a moment, Klink?
A5_4670_GIARU_200_1000	Kli li.
A5_4670_SEL_0_1000	About you, Klink...
A5_4670_SEL_0_2000	About Unitas...
A5_4670_SEL_0_3000	About the card key...
A5_4670_GIARU_300_1000	Kli link.
A5_4670_PIKACHU_300_1000	Yeah, I can tell you like small, enclosed spaces.
A5_4670_TIM_300_1000	That’s why it was sleeping in that computer in the\nfirst place.
A5_4670_GIARU_300_2000	Kliiink.
A5_4670_PIKACHU_300_2000	Apparently, this wasn’t a one-off thing—Klink gets\nitself stuck all the time.
A5_4670_PIKACHU_300_3000	Much to its partner’s annoyance, it seems.
A5_4670_TIM_300_2000	Heh. Guess it still hasn’t learned its lesson.
A5_4670_GIARU_300_3000	Kli kli!
A5_4670_PIKACHU_400_1000	Do you get along well with the humans in this\nplace, Klink?
A5_4670_GIARU_400_1000	Kliii.
A5_4670_PIKACHU_400_2000	Right, I know you’re good friends with your partner.
A5_4670_GIARU_400_2000	Kliiink...
A5_4670_PIKACHU_400_3000	Your partner hasn’t seemed as happy since you two\ncame here, huh?
A5_4670_PIKACHU_400_4000	It’s worried because its partner seems really\nconcerned about something.
A5_4670_PIKACHU_400_5000	Maybe Klink’s partner is having second thoughts\nabout the development of the cubes.
A5_4670_TIM_400_1000	Klink’s partner might not be a bad person, then.
A5_4670_PIKACHU_400_6000	Yeah, maybe not everyone in Unitas is awful.
A5_4670_PIKACHU_500_1000	Do you know where to find the card key that opens\nthe doors?
A5_4670_GIARU_500_1000	Kli?
A5_4670_PIKACHU_500_2000	Klink says its partner is always carrying a tool that\ncan open the doors.
A5_4670_PIKACHU_500_3000	Is there another one like it somewhere else?
A5_4670_GIARU_500_2000	Kli.
A5_4670_PIKACHU_500_4000	I guess all the researchers here keep their card keys\non them at all times.
A5_4670_TIM_500_1000	Then it could be hard to get our hands on one.
A5_4675_RACHEL_100_1000	I’m glad we were able to help Klink!
A5_4675_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, I’m just relieved it’s OK.
A5_4675_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hey, Tim. Is it just me, or does the shape of this Klink\nlook familiar?
A5_4675_TIM_100_2000	Hmm... That panel by the middle door, maybe?
A5_4675_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yep, exactly! Let’s head over there.
A5_4680_TIM_100_1000	Well, we managed to get Klink out—but now the\ncomputer’s all oily.
A5_4680_PIKACHU_100_1000	I feel kinda guilty about doing that to Klink’s\npartner...
A5_4680_PIKACHU_100_2000	Ah well. I’m sure they’d understand if they knew we\ndid it to help Klink!
A5_4685_TIM_100_1000	This door won’t budge.
A5_4685_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve gotta do something about those missing\ngears first.
A5_4690_PIKACHU_100_1000	How’s it look, Tim? How big are the gears we’re\ndealing with?
A5_4690_TIM_100_1000	I’m pretty sure Klink’s the perfect size!
A5_4690_PIKACHU_100_2000	Excellent! Wait here a sec—I’ll go get Klink.
A5_4690_PIKACHU_100_3000	...So anyway, think you can help us out, Klink?
A5_4690_GIARU_100_1000	Kliii kliii!
A5_4690_PIKACHU_100_4000	You’re up for the job, then? Thanks, Klink!
A5_4695_TIM_100_1000	All right! It worked!
A5_4695_PIKACHU_100_1000	Thanks, Klink. Now we can get inside.
A5_4695_GIARU_100_1000	Kliiink!
A5_4695_PIKACHU_100_2000	Oh, you’re gonna go find your partner?
A5_4695_GIARU_100_2000	Kli li?
A5_4695_PIKACHU_100_3000	But you don’t know where your partner is? ’Fraid I\ncan’t help you with that one...
A5_4695_TIM_100_2000	Maybe try upstairs? There’s a Unitas member\nsearching for Cramorant up there...
A5_4695_GIARU_100_3000	Klink.
A5_4695_PIKACHU_100_4000	If you’re heading upstairs, go ahead and use that hole\nin the ceiling.
A5_4695_GIARU_100_4000	Kliii!
A5_4695_PIKACHU_100_5000	No, no, YOU’RE the one who helped US! See ya\nlater, Klink!
A5_4695_TIM_100_3000	I hope Klink finds its partner.
A5_4695_PIKACHU_100_6000	Yeah, me too.
A5_4695_PIKACHU_100_7000	OK, now we’ve gotta investigate that room!
A5_4695_TIM_100_4000	I hope we can figure out what Merloch was\nresearching.
A5_4695_PIKACHU_100_8000	Yeah. Let’s go inside.
A5_4710_TIM_100_1000	Here we are—Merloch’s lab.
A5_4710_RACHEL_100_1000	Wow, there’s a lot of stuff in here... Where do we\neven start?
A5_4710_TIM_100_2000	No kidding... I don’t know how we’re gonna\ninvestigate all this.
A5_4710_PIKACHU_100_1000	But there’s bound to be really important info\nabout Unitas in here.
A5_4710_TIM_100_3000	Yeah. I hope we can find a card key too...
A5_4720_RACHEL_100_1000	Tim, about that voice recorder you found earlier...
A5_4720_RACHEL_100_2000	Papa’s...trying really hard to protect me, isn’t he?
A5_4720_TIM_100_1000	Seems that way, yeah.
A5_4720_RACHEL_100_3000	But the way he’s doing that is robbing Pokémon of\ntheir freedom.
A5_4720_RACHEL_100_4000	How does he not realize that would never make\nme happy?
A5_4720_PIKACHU_100_1000	It’s tempting to say he’s a failure as a father if his\nactions make his daughter sad...
A5_4720_PIKACHU_100_2000	But maybe he decided that was a price he was\nwilling to pay, so long as he could protect her.
A5_4720_TIM_100_2000	I think all you can do is tell him exactly how you\nfeel, Rachel.
A5_4720_RACHEL_100_5000	Yeah... You’re right.
A5_4720_RACHEL_200_1000	Papa’s making a huge mistake...
A5_4720_RACHEL_200_2000	We’ve gotta figure out how to stop him!
A5_4730_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve already investigated out there.
A5_4730_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s look around in Merloch’s lab.
A5_4740_TIM_100_1000	These look like experiment reports.
A5_4740_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeesh, I can barely read the handwriting...
A5_4740_PIKACHU_100_2000	And there are sticky notes stuck all over the place.
A5_4740_TIM_100_2000	Maybe we can read just the most important points.
A5_4740_PIKACHU_200_1000	Is there anything you’re still curious about?
A5_4740_SEL_0_1000	Meteorite energy experiments
A5_4740_SEL_0_2000	The Aurora Drop
A5_4740_TIM_300_1000	“I need a more effective method of extracting\nenergy from the meteorites.
A5_4740_TIM_300_2000	“A tremendous amount of high-purity energy is\nrequired to activate the Aurora Drop.”
A5_4740_PIKACHU_300_1000	Huh. It’s more research material on the meteorites,\nlike we found on floor B2.
A5_4740_TIM_300_3000	“Based on my recent experiments, I was able to lay\nout a plan to achieve the final goal.
A5_4740_TIM_300_4000	“All that remains is to order the operations team to\ncollect a sufficient amount of meteorites.”
A5_4740_PIKACHU_300_2000	So those goons we ran into at the ruins were acting\nunder Merloch’s orders.
A5_4740_TIM_300_5000	But what’s this “final goal” he’s talking about? I can’t\ntell from the document.
A5_4740_PIKACHU_300_3000	Yeah... I’ve been wondering that myself.
A5_4740_TIM_400_1000	“I conducted an experiment in which I exposed the\nAurora Drop to energy from the meteorites.
A5_4740_TIM_400_2000	“It was a success. The Aurora Drop showed clear signs\nof activation.
A5_4740_TIM_400_3000	“However, only a fragment of the whole\nwas activated.
A5_4740_TIM_400_4000	“I must trigger this activation throughout the entirety\nof the Aurora Drop.
A5_4740_TIM_400_5000	“Doing so will necessitate more experiments...”
A5_4740_PIKACHU_400_1000	He wants to “activate” the Aurora Drop? Guess it\nreally isn’t just an ordinary jewel.
A5_4750_PIKACHU_100_1000	The energy of the meteorites...and the Aurora Drop...
A5_4750_PIKACHU_100_2000	Apparently he’ll be able to activate the Aurora Drop\nif he keeps up his research on those two things.
A5_4750_TIM_100_1000	But the report doesn’t say what that means. What’ll\nhappen when the Aurora Drop is activated?
A5_4750_TIM_100_2000	What exactly is Merloch trying to accomplish with\nthis research?
A5_4750_PIKACHU_100_3000	It’s gotta have something to do with that “final goal”\nhe wrote about...
A5_4760_TIM_100_1000	There’s a bunch of different information scribbled\non here.
A5_4760_PIKACHU_100_1000	The handwriting’s awful! This is gonna be hard\nto decipher.
A5_4760_TIM_100_2000	It’s hard to tell exactly, but it looks like summaries of\na few different things.
A5_4760_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s read each one carefully.
A5_4760_PIKACHU_200_1000	Is there something you’re still curious about?
A5_4760_SEL_0_1000	About distributing the cubes...
A5_4760_SEL_0_2000	About using Butler...
A5_4760_SEL_0_3000	About Pikachu...
A5_4760_TIM_300_1000	This note looks like it was scrawled in a hurry.
A5_4760_TIM_300_2000	“In order to promote the widespread use of cubes\nthroughout the world, we must highlight the dangers\nPokémon pose to humans.
A5_4760_TIM_300_3000	“News stories that reveal famous and popular\nPokémon to actually be dangerous are especially\neffective at achieving this.
A5_4760_TIM_300_4000	“For example...Detective Pikachu.”
A5_4760_PIKACHU_300_1000	Well, that explains a lot.
A5_4760_PIKACHU_300_2000	I AM pretty famous in Ryme City.
A5_4760_PIKACHU_300_3000	If news got out that I’d destroyed that Slowpoke\nstatue...
A5_4760_TIM_300_5000	...People in the city would probably start feeling\nless safe.
A5_4760_PIKACHU_300_4000	Right, which would lead more and more people to\nbelieve the cubes are necessary.
A5_4760_TIM_300_6000	Good thing we were able to prove your innocence\nbefore that story made the news.
A5_4760_PIKACHU_300_5000	You’re telling me. Still, now I wonder...
A5_4760_PIKACHU_300_6000	Is that the only reason they detained me?
A5_4760_PIKACHU_400_1000	The writing over here’s just as sloppy. Can you read\nit, Tim?
A5_4760_TIM_400_1000	Let’s see... “I have no concerns with using Butler.
A5_4760_TIM_400_2000	“If anything goes wrong at the PPB, the responsibility\nwill fall entirely on him.”
A5_4760_PIKACHU_400_2000	Butler? As in the former chief of the Pokémon\nProtection Bureau?
A5_4760_TIM_400_3000	So Butler was working with Merloch as well, huh?
A5_4760_TIM_500_1000	There’s some stuff written about you here, Pikachu.
A5_4760_PIKACHU_500_1000	And judging by the handwriting, Merloch must’ve\nbeen pretty worked up when he wrote it.
A5_4760_TIM_500_2000	“Project Detective Pikachu, Phase 1: Meet the\nspecimen in person and measure its vitals!
A5_4760_TIM_500_3000	“Project Detective Pikachu, Phase 2: Receive the\nspecimen from the PPB!
A5_4760_TIM_500_4000	“Project Detective Pikachu, Phase 3: Extract the\nenergy from the specimen!”
A5_4760_PIKACHU_500_2000	“Receive the specimen...”? Guess that's referring to\nwhen the PPB was detaining me.
A5_4760_PIKACHU_500_3000	Maybe they did something to me when I was being\ncontrolled by the cube and had no idea what was\ngoing on.
A5_4760_TIM_500_5000	We managed to stop them from delivering you to\nUnitas, but Merloch’s plan is still moving forward...
A5_4770_TIM_100_1000	So the stuff on the whiteboard is all about when you\nwere detained at the police station.
A5_4770_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yep. So it appears.
A5_4770_PIKACHU_100_2000	Unitas had me arrested to make it look like Pokémon\nare dangerous.
A5_4770_TIM_100_2000	But what did that part about extracting the energy\nfrom you mean?
A5_4770_PIKACHU_100_3000	Beats me...
A5_4770_TIM_100_3000	The papers we read earlier mentioned energy in\nDad’s body, too.
A5_4770_PIKACHU_100_4000	Merloch seems to be gathering energy from a variety\nof sources—but what’s he planning to do with it?
A5_4780_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s a voice recorder.
A5_4780_TIM_100_1000	It seems to have more than one recording on it.
A5_4780_PIKACHU_100_2000	What’ll we listen to first?
A5_4780_PIKACHU_200_1000	Which recording do you wanna listen to?
A5_4780_SEL_0_1000	Research Arrangements
A5_4780_SEL_0_2000	Cube Presentation
A5_4780_TIM_300_1000	There’s a recording titled “Research Arrangements.”
A5_4780_PIKACHU_300_1000	Let’s hear it.
A5_4780_TIM_400_1000	There’s a track titled “Cube Presentation.”
A5_4780_PIKACHU_400_1000	Let’s hear it.
A5_4795_TIM_100_1000	Merloch was the one who suggested to Mayor\nMyers to restart Emma’s research?
A5_4795_PIKACHU_100_1000	He’s been involved with all this right from the start.
A5_4805_RACHEL_100_1000	Papa knew the side effects the Pokémon would face,\nbut he still didn’t stop the plan...
A5_4805_TIM_100_1000	No, but he was at least worried about them. If nothing\nelse, that shows there’s kindness in him.
A5_4805_TIM_100_2000	I don’t know that the same can be said for Merloch.\nThat recording painted a pretty clear picture of what\nkind of person he is.
A5_4810_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’ve had a bad feeling about Merloch from the\nmoment we met him, but I didn’t realize he was\nTHIS terrible.
A5_4810_TIM_100_1000	This research hurts Pokémon, but he’s pushing forward\nwith such enthusiasm...
A5_4810_TIM_100_2000	We have to stop him somehow.
A5_4830_TIM_100_1000	There’s another room back there.\n...Wait, huh?
A5_4830_PIKACHU_100_1000	What is it, Tim? You see something?
A5_4830_TIM_100_2000	Are those...photos of Dad and Pikachu?
A5_4841_PIKACHU_100_1000	This back room wasn’t on the map.
A5_4841_TIM_100_1000	Maybe Merloch wanted to keep it a secret.
A5_4841_PIKACHU_100_2000	That seems likely. I wanna get a good look around\nin there.
A5_4850_PIKACHU_100_1000	This door’s locked with a passcode.
A5_4850_TIM_100_1000	Guess we’re looking for numbers again.
A5_4855_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like this is where we enter the passcode to\nopen the door.
A5_4855_TIM_100_1000	Guess we’re looking for numbers again.
A5_4860_TIM_100_1000	Well, we’ve searched the whole room...
A5_4860_TIM_100_2000	but we still haven’t found the door passcode.
A5_4860_PIKACHU_100_1000	What about the numbers on the whiteboard in that\nback room?
A5_4860_PIKACHU_100_2000	They’ve gotta be worth a shot at least.
A5_4865_TIM_100_1000	The door’s locked...
A5_4865_PIKACHU_100_1000	Why don’t you try entering those numbers you\nsaw, Tim?
A5_4870_PIKACHU_100_1000	Do you remember the numbers from the whiteboard\nin the back room?
A5_4870_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, they were 200122 and 170608.
A5_4870_PIKACHU_100_2000	We don’t know which one’s right, or if they’re even\npasscodes at all.
A5_4870_PIKACHU_100_3000	But there’s no harm in trying ’em out. Go for it, Tim!
A5_4890_PIKACHU_100_1000	That’s it! The door opened!
A5_4890_TIM_100_1000	Now we can take a look around in the back room.
A5_4900_TIM_100_1000	This lab must be Merloch’s as well.
A5_4900_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, probably. But what’s going on in here?
A5_4900_TIM_100_2000	There’s some high-tech equipment in here, along with\na photo of you, Pikachu...
A5_4900_RACHEL_100_1000	This room’s got a totally different vibe from\nthe others...
A5_4900_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, you said it...
A5_4900_PIKACHU_100_3000	Let’s take a good, thorough look around, Tim.
A5_4910_RACHEL_100_1000	This room feels so different from the others... What\nkind of experiments has he been doing in here?
A5_4910_TIM_100_1000	That’s what we’re here to find out.
A5_4910_RACHEL_200_1000	What kind of experiments was Merloch doing?
A5_4920_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wait a second, Tim. There’s still something we’ve\ngotta do.
A5_4920_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, you’re right.
A5_4930_TIM_100_1000	This is definitely a picture of you, Pikachu.
A5_4930_PIKACHU_100_1000	What the heck does all of this mean?! Let’s take a\nlook and see if there’s anything else here.
A5_4930_PIKACHU_200_1000	Is there anything you’re still curious about?
A5_4930_SEL_0_1000	Photos of Harry and Pikachu
A5_4930_SEL_0_2000	Hastily written words
A5_4930_SEL_0_3000	Numbers
A5_4930_PIKACHU_300_1000	Merloch is seriously starting to creep me out...
A5_4930_PIKACHU_300_2000	Keepin’ pictures of me and Pikachu posted up in\nhis room... What’s up with that?!
A5_4930_TIM_300_1000	Not to mention stealing Dad’s body and keeping it\nsomewhere in this building.
A5_4930_PIKACHU_300_3000	The fact that he’s got these photos of me—er,\nHarry—and Pikachu, right next to each other...
A5_4930_PIKACHU_300_4000	Makes me wonder if Merloch’s already figured it out.
A5_4930_TIM_300_1500	Figured what out?
A5_4930_PIKACHU_300_5000	That my consciousness is in Pikachu’s body.
A5_4930_TIM_300_2000	No way...
A5_4930_PIKACHU_300_6000	If not, then why’s he been targeting me so\npersistently?
A5_4930_TIM_400_1000	I can barely read what’s written here.
A5_4930_TIM_400_2000	“Meteorite”...“Aurora Drop”... “Human”...
A5_4930_TIM_400_3000	That’s all I can make out.
A5_4930_PIKACHU_400_1000	It seems like the energy from the meteorites is\npretty important.
A5_4930_TIM_500_1000	200122 and 170608...
A5_4930_PIKACHU_500_1000	Pretty careless of him to display the door passcode\nso prominently.
A5_4930_TIM_500_2000	I’m wondering more about the number we haven’t\nused yet.
A5_4930_PIKACHU_500_2000	That could also be a passcode...but I can’t say\nfor sure.
A5_4935_TIM_100_1000	Let’s say Merloch really has figured out your secret,\nPikachu.
A5_4935_TIM_100_2000	Just what was he planning to do with you after he’d\ncaptured you?
A5_4935_PIKACHU_100_1000	Your guess is as good as mine.
A5_4935_PIKACHU_100_2000	Let’s head down to B5 and look for my—I mean,\nHarry’s body.
A5_4935_PIKACHU_100_3000	Seeing it up close might help us figure this all out.
A5_4940_TIM_100_1000	This looks like some equipment for conducting\nexperiments.
A5_4940_PIKACHU_100_1000	Seems like he was mixing two substances together.
A5_4940_PIKACHU_100_2000	Can’t tell what kind of experiments he was doing from\nthis alone, though.
A5_4940_TIM_200_1000	What sort of equipment is this?
A5_4940_PIKACHU_200_1000	No clue.
A5_4960_PIKACHU_100_1000	I’ve got a weird feeling about this lab, Tim. Let’s give\nit a thorough search.
A5_4960_TIM_100_1000	Right.
A5_4960_PIKACHU_200_1000	Look closely so you don’t miss anything, Tim.
A5_4970_PIKACHU_100_1000	OK, where should we start looking?
A5_4970_PIKACHU_200_1000	Is there anywhere you forgot to look?
A5_4980_PIKACHU_5000_1000	Hey, Tim. You haven’t checked everywhere yet.
A5_4990_TIM_100_1000	These papers are completely covered in sloppily\nscribbled equations. They look, uh...complicated.
A5_4990_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, this all means absolutely nothing to me.
A5_5000_TIM_100_1000	This document was written by Mayor Myers.
A5_5000_TIM_100_2000	The title is...“Coexistence Plan for Ryme City.”
A5_5000_PIKACHU_100_1000	It also says “Confidential.”
A5_5000_TIM_100_3000	<color=#F39800FF>Looks like it contains a schedule for distributing the\ncubes throughout the city.</color>
A5_5000_TIM_100_4000	It says the mayor will make an announcement about\nthe cubes on the last day of Pokémon Friendship\nWeek.
A5_5000_PIKACHU_100_2000	Guess that settles it... That “revolutionary device” \nthat’s been making news lately is definitely the cubes.
A5_5000_TIM_100_5000	There’s a draft of his speech in here, too. I’ll read it.
A5_5000_TIM_100_6000	“Citizens of Ryme City, allow me to once again\nexpress my plans for our mutual home.
A5_5000_TIM_100_7000	“I aim to foster a city in which people and Pokémon\ncan live together in peace and safety.
A5_5000_TIM_100_8000	“For many of you, the R incident of two years ago was\nan unprecedented hardship...
A5_5000_TIM_100_9000	“I assure you, no one knows that hardship better than\nI do.
A5_5000_TIM_100_10000	“But Ryme City will not stop moving forward.
A5_5000_TIM_100_11000	“As a testament to our commitment to mutual\ncoexistence between people and Pokémon...
A5_5000_TIM_100_12000	“we have created a truly revolutionary device!
A5_5000_TIM_100_13000	“And so, on this last day of Pokémon Friendship\nWeek, it is my honor to finally unveil to you...
A5_5000_TIM_100_14000	“the Friendship Cube!”
A5_5000_RACHEL_100_1000	Papa...
A5_5000_PIKACHU_100_3000	By “Friendship Cube,” he means the Control Cubes,\nright?
A5_5000_TIM_100_15000	That’s right. He’s planning to distribute these cubes\nthat can control Pokémon all over the city!
A5_5000_PIKACHU_100_4000	We can’t let him deliver that speech he’s got planned.
A5_5010_TIM_100_1000	<color=#F39800FF>Do you think this voice recorder also belongs to\nMerloch?</color>
A5_5010_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah, and it might have some important information.\nLet’s give it a listen after this.
A5_5030_TIM_100_1000	It’s some kind of experiment report.
A5_5030_PIKACHU_100_1000	Read it to us, Tim.
A5_5030_TIM_100_2000	“The experiment was a failure.
A5_5030_TIM_100_3000	“To make two become one, the proper balance of\nenergy is absolutely critical.
A5_5030_TIM_100_4000	“Too much or too little will result in failure.
A5_5030_TIM_100_5000	“Making adjustments will be difficult, but necessary.
A5_5030_TIM_100_6000	“But I can do this—I know I can do this! Only I can\nmake two become one!”
A5_5030_PIKACHU_100_2000	“Two become one”? Was he trying to fuse two things\ntogether?
A5_5030_TIM_100_7000	“The proper balance of energy is absolutely critical.”\nHe literally underlined this part for emphasis.
A5_5040_TIM_100_1000	This document’s titled, “Shutting Down the Fusion\nMachine.”
A5_5040_PIKACHU_100_1000	Fusion machine? What kinda machine is that?
A5_5040_TIM_100_2000	No idea. All it says here is how to stop it.
A5_5040_TIM_100_3000	“To shut down the machine in the event of an\nemergency, remove the power cable!”
A5_5040_PIKACHU_100_2000	...That’s it?
A5_5040_TIM_100_4000	Yeah, that’s all it says. Judging from the messy writing,\nwhoever jotted this down must’ve been in a hurry.
A5_5040_PIKACHU_100_3000	More of a memo than a document, if you ask me.
A5_5060_PIKACHU_100_1000	Looks like there’s nothing else to investigate here.
A5_5061_PIKACHU_100_1000	I don’t see anything else I’m particularly curious\nabout.
A5_5070_TIM_100_1000	Don’t you think we should listen to this voice\nrecorder?
A5_5070_PIKACHU_100_1000	Definitely.
A5_5070_TIM_100_2000	It’s got three tracks on it. Which do you want to hear?
A5_5070_PIKACHU_200_1000	Which recording do you wanna listen to?
A5_5070_SEL_0_1000	Research Data
A5_5070_SEL_0_2000	Finding Jessica
A5_5070_SEL_0_3000	Proving My Hypothesis
A5_5070_TIM_300_1000	There’s one titled “Research Data.”
A5_5070_PIKACHU_300_1000	Let’s hear it.
A5_5070_TIM_300_2000	Sure thing.
A5_5070_TIM_400_1000	There’s one titled “Finding Jessica.”
A5_5070_PIKACHU_400_1000	Go ahead and play it.
A5_5070_TIM_500_1000	There’s one titled “Proving My Hypothesis.”
A5_5070_PIKACHU_500_1000	Let’s see what we can learn.
A5_5085_PIKACHU_100_1000	He had Jessica targeted and Emma’s data stolen all\nso he could work on his new research.
A5_5085_RACHEL_100_1000	That’s so...awful.
A5_5095_TIM_100_1000	Huh? “Simulations of linking minds”...?
A5_5095_PIKACHU_100_1000	Whatever Merloch’s goal is...I don’t think it’s good.
A5_5105_RACHEL_100_1000	He’s using my mom’s research for his own ends...\nWhat is wrong with that man?!
A5_5105_PIKACHU_100_1000	I couldn’t agree more.
A5_5105_TIM_100_1000	Merloch’s trying to make something even worse than\nthe cubes...
A5_5105_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah—and we’ve gotta stop him.
A5_5110_TIM_100_1000	Listening to those recordings, Merloch sounded...\nunhinged.
A5_5110_PIKACHU_100_1000	He was getting awfully excited by the thought of\nachieving whatever wild dream he has.
A5_5110_PIKACHU_100_2000	According to him, the cubes are just toys compared\nto whatever he’s got cooking now...
A5_5110_TIM_100_2000	I wonder if the mayor is even aware of what\nMerloch’s up to...
A5_5110_PIKACHU_100_3000	There’s a lot we still don’t know, but at least we have\na better idea of why Jessica was targeted.
A5_5110_TIM_100_3000	Right. Let’s take a moment to digest all this\ninformation and make some deductions.
A5_5120_TIM_100_1000	Unitas—no, Merloch is willing to do whatever it takes\nto pursue his research...
A5_5120_PIKACHU_100_1000	We’ve gotta do something...
A5_5140_PIKACHU_100_1000	We have a lot of info to pick over, but this much is\nclear: three people are at the center of this mystery.
A5_5140_PIKACHU_100_2000	Howard, Merloch, and Emma.
A5_5140_TIM_100_1000	Those three are closely connected with Unitas.
A5_5140_PIKACHU_100_3000	Yeah, but they each had different goals.
A5_5140_PIKACHU_100_4000	Let’s think a bit more about those three people.
A5_5140_SEL_0_1000	Howard’s real intentions
A5_5140_SEL_0_2000	Merloch’s goal
A5_5140_SEL_0_3000	Emma’s ideals and research
A5_5140_PIKACHU_300_1000	Howard’s trying to have cubes attached to the\nPokémon of Ryme City.
A5_5140_TIM_300_1000	After hearing that recording, I at least kind of\nunderstand where he’s coming from.
A5_5140_PIKACHU_300_2000	He wants to protect Rachel and make sure something\nlike the R incident never happens again.
A5_5140_PIKACHU_300_3000	He’s got good intentions, but his methods are way\noff the mark.
A5_5140_TIM_300_2000	We just have to convince him of that somehow.
A5_5140_PIKACHU_400_1000	Merloch is set on continuing his research no\nmatter what.
A5_5140_TIM_400_1000	He even went so far as stealing Emma’s research so\nhe could advance his own.
A5_5140_PIKACHU_400_2000	We don’t know exactly what he’s researching, but I\nthink it’s safe to assume it’s nothing good.
A5_5140_TIM_400_2000	He said something about “simulations of linking\nminds.”
A5_5140_PIKACHU_400_3000	I think the only way we’re gonna find out more about\nthat is if we ask Merloch himself.
A5_5140_TIM_500_1000	The goal of Emma’s research was mutual\nunderstanding between humans and Pokémon.
A5_5140_PIKACHU_500_1000	She seemed to be trying to create a society where\nhumans and Pokémon could perfectly coexist.
A5_5140_PIKACHU_500_2000	She sounds like she had a good heart.
A5_5140_TIM_500_2000	But now, Merloch’s using Emma’s research data.
A5_5140_PIKACHU_500_3000	Right—data that was so dangerous she tried to\nseal it away.
A5_5140_PIKACHU_500_4000	The Unitas we’re seeing now is nothing like the Unitas\nProject Emma was part of.
A5_5145_PIKACHU_100_1000	I think we’ve seen about all there is to see on\nthis floor.
A5_5145_TIM_100_1000	If only we could head down to the next floor.
A5_5145_TIM_100_2000	But we’re not getting there without a card key.
A5_5145_PIKACHU_100_2000	Right, and we didn’t even find one in the lab.
A5_5145_TIM_100_3000	But there doesn’t seem to be anywhere else to look.\nWhat should we do?
A5_5145_PIKACHU_100_3000	For now, let’s head out and join the others. Maybe\nwe’ll uncover something new.
A5_5145_TIM_100_4000	OK.
A5_5147_PIKACHU_100_1000	I don’t think we’ve investigated everything in this\nlab yet.
A5_5147_TIM_100_1000	Yeah, you’re right. Let’s investigate more thoroughly.
A5_5150_RACHEL_100_1000	I know Papa’s trying to protect me.
A5_5150_RACHEL_100_2000	But using the cubes to do that is wrong.
A5_5150_RACHEL_100_3000	I just...hope he’ll understand.
A5_5150_RACHEL_200_1000	I want Papa to care about Pokémon’s feelings too.
A5_5150_RACHEL_200_2000	I just...hope he’ll understand.
A5_5155_PIKACHU_100_1000	Hm?
A5_5155_TIM_100_1000	What is it?
A5_5155_PIKACHU_100_2000	I hear someone talking...up above.
A5_5170_TIM_100_1000	Wow! Way to go, Growlithe and Pangoro!
A5_5170_PIKACHU_100_1000	Don’t bust out the party hats yet. Someone from\nUnitas is bound to show up any second now.
A5_5170_PIKACHU_100_2000	According to the floor map, there are stairs on the\nother side of the door on the right.
A5_5170_PIKACHU_100_3000	We need to get a move on, Tim!
A5_5170_TIM_100_2000	Right!
A5_5180_RACHEL_100_1000	Let’s hurry, Tim! Unitas’ll be here soon!
A5_5180_TIM_100_1000	Right. We can’t afford to get caught here!
A5_5180_RACHEL_200_1000	We have to get downstairs before Unitas shows up!
A5_5190_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well done, Growlithe!
A5_5190_GARDIE_100_1000	Gow!
A5_5190_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, we’ve gotta hurry downstairs before they come\nfind us!
A5_5190_GARDIE_200_1000	Gow-wow!
A5_5190_PIKACHU_200_1000	Well done, Growlithe!
A5_5200_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Darmaaa!
A5_5200_PIKACHU_100_1000	If those goons show up, you’ll send ’em packing?
A5_5200_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’m glad you’re so brave, Darmanitan, but we really\ndidn’t come here to battle.
A5_5200_PIKACHU_100_3000	Let’s hurry and get downstairs!
A5_5200_GHIHIDARUMA_200_1000	Darmaaa!
A5_5200_PIKACHU_200_1000	Only as a last resort! Right now we’ve gotta run!
A5_5210_RENTORAR_100_1000	Lux...
A5_5210_PIKACHU_100_1000	What? You’re feelin’ anxious?
A5_5210_RENTORAR_100_2000	Luxray.
A5_5210_PIKACHU_100_2000	Ah, you’re anxious to see the face of the creep who\ngot you locked up in the police station?
A5_5210_PIKACHU_100_3000	Sheesh, I should’ve known.
A5_5210_RENTORAR_200_1000	Raaay!
A5_5210_PIKACHU_200_1000	Yeah, our goal’s right beneath us. Let’s hurry, Luxray!
A5_5220_GORONDA_100_1000	Goro.
A5_5220_PIKACHU_100_1000	You’ll make sure we get downstairs, no matter what?
A5_5220_PIKACHU_100_2000	Always knew I could count on you, Pangoro. Now,\nlet’s get a move on!
A5_5220_GORONDA_200_1000	Gorohhh!
A5_5220_PIKACHU_200_1000	Yeah! If worse comes to worst, it’s all up to you!
A5_5230_PIKACHU_100_1000	We read that there are a ton of crates blocking the\nway through this door, remember?
A5_5230_PIKACHU_100_2000	We gotta go the other way and use THAT door, Tim!
A5_5240_TIM_100_1000	Now we can finally get down to the bottom floor!\nJust gotta open this door with the card key, and—
A5_5240_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wait, Tim! I hear something! Get back!
A5_5260_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, we managed to get away from Unitas, thanks to\nGrowlithe. Unfortunately...
A5_5260_TIM_100_1000	...We can’t go any farther. All those crates are\nblocking the way!
A5_5260_PIKACHU_100_2000	Then we’ve just gotta force our way through!
A5_5260_GHIHIDARUMA_100_1000	Dadar?
A5_5260_PIKACHU_100_3000	That’s right—you’re up, Darmanitan!
A5_5260_GHIHIDARUMA_100_2000	Daaar!
A5_5420_PIKACHU_100_1000	Well, we finally made it to the bottom floor.
A5_5420_RACHEL_100_1000	I just hope everyone back upstairs is still OK...
A5_5420_TIM_100_1000	They’ll be all right—we’ve seen how capable they are\nof fending for themselves. For now, let’s focus on\ngetting through to your dad.
A5_5420_RACHEL_100_2000	Right...
A5_5420_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hm? I hear someone up ahead.
A5_5420_SECRETMURDOCH_100_1000	Hmm, hmm-hmm! ♪
A5_5420_TIM_100_2000	Someone’s...humming?
A5_5420_RACHEL_100_3000	Hey, look up there... Is that who I think it is?
A5_5420_TIM_100_3000	Yeah...
A5_5420_MURDOCH_100_1000	Hmm-hmm-hmm, hmmm! ♪
A5_5420_TIM_100_4000	...It’s Merloch.
A5_5420_PIKACHU_100_3000	If he’s here, that probably means Howard’s here too.
A5_5420_PIKACHU_100_4000	You know what to do, Tim.
A5_5420_TIM_100_5000	Yeah—I’ve got to convince the mayor to stop this plan\nthey’re working on.
A5_5420_TIM_100_6000	And to do that, we need to expose Merloch and\nprove what he’s really up to.
A5_5420_PIKACHU_100_5000	Sure, but at this point, Howard’s likely dead set on\nseeing his vision through.
A5_5420_PIKACHU_100_6000	Even if you blow Merloch’s plot wide open, that\nmight not be enough to convince Howard to change\nhis mind.
A5_5420_TIM_100_7000	I know. But we’ve gotta try.
A5_5420_PIKACHU_100_7000	For Rachel and Howard...
A5_5420_PIKACHU_100_8000	For the Pokémon of Ryme City...
A5_5420_TIM_100_8000	...And for you—both of you.
A5_5420_PIKACHU_100_9000	Thanks, Tim.
A5_5420_TIM_100_9000	All right, let’s do this!
A5_5420_PIKACHU_100_10000	Yeah!
A5_5430_RACHEL_100_1000	Is Papa not here after all?
A5_5430_TIM_100_1000	No, I’m sure he’s around. Let’s ask Merloch.
A5_5430_RACHEL_100_2000	OK, but...be careful, Tim.
A5_5430_PIKACHU_100_1000	Don’t worry, Rachel! We can handle this!
A5_5430_RACHEL_200_1000	Tim, Pikachu... Please be careful.
A5_5435_TIM_100_1000	We’ve already come this far.
A5_5435_TIM_100_2000	All we can do now is keep moving forward.
A5_5450_TIM_100_1000	...Mr. Merloch.
A5_5450_MURDOCH_100_1000	Oh my, would you look at this. What might you all be\ndoing here?
A5_5450_MURDOCH_100_2000	Ah...yes. You must have been the cause of all that\ncommotion earlier.
A5_5450_MURDOCH_100_3000	That explains why my entire staff rushed upstairs.
A5_5450_MURDOCH_100_4000	But the question of WHY you’re here still stands.
A5_5450_MURDOCH_100_5000	Did Howard invite you to join him for front-row seats\nto the shipment of the cubes?
A5_5450_TIM_100_2000	We let ourselves in, actually—we’re here to see\nthe mayor.
A5_5450_MURDOCH_100_6000	Hmm... I see.
A5_5450_TIM_100_3000	So tell us, Mr. Merloch. Where is—
A5_5450_PIKACHU_100_1000	Wait! Here he comes.
A5_5520_MURDOCHD_100_1000	You’re wondering why I’ve done all this...
A5_5520_MURDOCHD_100_2000	I’m about to realize my dream—my dream of\nbecoming a Pokémon!
A5_5520_TIM_100_1000	You want to...BECOME a Pokémon?
A5_5520_MURDOCHD_100_3000	Yes. Yes, I do.
A5_5520_MURDOCHD_100_4000	And to achieve that, I needed THIS!
A5_5560_TIM_100_1000	Growlithe and the others will be safe with Rachel.\nI’ve gotta focus on saving Pikachu!
A5_5560_TIM_100_2000	I’m coming, Pikachu!
A5_5565_TIM_100_1000	I need to hurry and save Pikachu!
A5_5570_TIM_100_1000	I can’t just leave Dad here.
A5_5570_TIM_100_2000	I’ve gotta get him out of that pod!
A5_5580_TIM_100_1000	Pikachu’s inside the pod, but I can’t get it open!
A5_5580_TIM_100_2000	Can you hear me, Pikachu?!
A5_5580_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yes, I can hear you! You don’t have to shout...
A5_5580_TIM_100_3000	Oh, I’m so glad you’re OK!
A5_5580_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, more or less. But this thing won’t open up!
A5_5580_PIKACHU_100_3000	Can you get me outta here?
A5_5580_TIM_100_4000	It won’t open from this side, either!
A5_5580_PIKACHU_100_4000	Must be locked.
A5_5580_PIKACHU_100_5000	You don’t see a passcode terminal around here by\nchance, do you?
A5_5580_TIM_100_5000	I’ll take a look!
A5_5580_PIKACHU_100_6000	Thanks, Tim.
A5_5580_PIKACHU_200_1000	Is there a passcode terminal around here somewhere?
A5_5580_TIM_200_1000	Just sit tight. I’ll look around!
A5_5590_TIM_100_1000	There it is! Dad’s body!
A5_5590_TIM_100_2000	Merloch used it just now to extract the energy\nhe needed!
A5_5590_TIM_100_3000	Hold on, Dad! When all this is over, I’ll save you—\nI swear!
A5_5600_TIM_100_1000	It’s Merloch’s body.
A5_5600_TIM_100_2000	He looks like he’s just sleeping.
A5_5600_TIM_100_3000	But he’s actually been fused with a Pokémon, just\nlike Dad.
A5_5610_TIM_100_1000	I’m pretty sure the pod will open if I input the\npasscode here.
A5_5610_TIM_100_2000	We saw two numbers written out in Merloch’s lab...
A5_5610_TIM_100_3000	200122 and 170608.
A5_5610_TIM_100_4000	One of those oughta open this.
A5_5640_PIKACHU_100_1000	Oof... I’m feelin’ kinda wobbly. Must be all that\nenergy he drained outta me.
A5_5640_TIM_100_1000	Oh no! What about the original Pikachu’s\nconsciousness?
A5_5640_PIKACHU_100_2000	Hey, don’t look so down! Everything’ll be fine once\nwe take care of things here.
A5_5640_PIKACHU_100_3000	Besides, we’ve got Mewtwo right over there!
A5_5640_TIM_100_2000	Yeah...
A5_5640_PIKACHU_100_4000	So all we gotta do is stop Merloch.
A5_5640_TIM_100_3000	But how?
A5_5640_PIKACHU_100_5000	Your guess is as good as mine. All I know is we’ve\ngotta do whatever we can.
A5_5640_TIM_100_4000	Right.
A5_5640_TIM_100_5000	Great Detective Tip #48...
A5_5640_TIM_100_6000	Never EVER give up!
A5_5640_PIKACHU_100_6000	That’s the spirit, Tim! First, let’s stop this machine!
A5_5645_TIM_100_1000	We have to hurry and stop Merloch!
A5_5646_TIM_100_1000	We can’t let Merloch get away with this!
A5_5650_PIKACHU_100_1000	Merloch used this machine to fuse himself with\nDeoxys.
A5_5650_PIKACHU_100_2000	If we can stop the energy Merloch extracted from\nbeing supplied to the machine, we might be able to\nreverse the fusion.
A5_5650_TIM_100_1000	OK, so how do we do that?
A5_5650_PIKACHU_100_3000	What’re you askin’ me for?! I’ve got no clue how to\nstop this thing!
A5_5650_PIKACHU_100_4000	But in this situation, I think the simplest thing to do is\ncut the power!
A5_5650_PIKACHU_100_5000	C’mon, Tim!
A5_5660_PIKACHU_100_1000	This must be the power supply for the fusion machine.
A5_5660_TIM_100_1000	How can we stop this thing?
A5_5660_PIKACHU_100_2000	Sorry, Tim. This is way beyond me.
A5_5660_TIM_100_2000	I thought you knew a lot about electricity!
A5_5660_PIKACHU_100_3000	Electricity is one thing. Why would I know anything\nabout a specialized piece of equipment like this?
A5_5660_PIKACHU_100_4000	Let’s just fiddle around with it and see what works.\nNot like we can do anything else!
A5_5660_PIKACHU_100_5000	Maybe we’ll learn something useful if you start\npressing random buttons.
A5_5660_TIM_100_3000	As long as it doesn’t explode or something if I press\nthe wrong one...
A5_5660_PIKACHU_100_6000	I’m pretty sure that won’t happen. Doesn’t make sense\nto rig a machine this important with explosives.
A5_5670_TIM_100_1000	There’s no time! I’m just gonna go for it!
A5_5670_PIKACHU_100_1000	While you’re pushing buttons, Tim, try to deduce how\nto cut off power to the machine.
A5_5700_TIM_100_1000	That didn’t cut off the power...
A5_5700_PIKACHU_100_1000	There’s probably a specific order you’ve gotta do\nthis in.
A5_5700_TIM_200_1000	Nope, still not working...
A5_5700_PIKACHU_200_1000	I think what’s most important is tackling this in the\nright order BEFORE you pull the lever.
A5_5710_PIKACHU_100_1000	Don’t give up, Tim. Just clear your head and guess\nthe order.
A5_5760_PIKACHU_100_1000	All right! All the switches are off.
A5_5760_PIKACHU_100_2000	Looks like that shut down the power supply.\nGood job, Tim!
A5_5770_TIM_100_1000	I’m not so sure... Cutting the power doesn’t seem to\nbe reversing the fusion at all.
A5_5770_PIKACHU_100_1000	Darn. Back to the drawing board!
A5_5770_PIKACHU_100_2000	I’m thinkin’ we gotta fiddle with the fusion machine\nitself!
A5_5770_TIM_100_2000	It’s not like I’ve got any better ideas! C’mon,\nPikachu—to the fusion machine!
A5_5780_PIKACHU_100_1000	This is the fusion machine.
A5_5780_TIM_100_1000	It looks even more complicated than the power\nsupply...
A5_5780_PIKACHU_100_2000	Yeah, but we’ve still gotta stop it!
A5_5780_PIKACHU_100_3000	I think those glowing bits are the energy Merloch\nused for the fusion.
A5_5780_PIKACHU_100_4000	Maybe if we remove those little capsules...
A5_5780_TIM_100_2000	But...how do we remove those capsules from the\nmachine?
A5_5780_PIKACHU_100_5000	I know we saw something in Merloch’s lab about\nemergency procedures...
A5_5780_PIKACHU_100_6000	Gah! This is the worst possible time to forget!
A5_5790_PIKACHU_100_1000	I know it’s not the approach a detective should take,\nbut I think trial-and-error’s our only option here!
A5_5790_TIM_100_1000	I’ll see what I can do!
A5_5800_PIKACHU_5000_1000	Are you getting distracted thinking about Growlithe\nand the others? You need to focus, Tim.
A5_5800_TIM_5000_1000	Yeah, you’re right... We’ve gotta do something about\nthe fusion energy.
A5_5820_TIM_100_1000	Do you think we could pull that cable out?
A5_5820_PIKACHU_100_1000	Yeah! We disconnected it!
A5_5820_TIM_100_2000	But the machine’s still running!
A5_5820_PIKACHU_100_2000	There’s gotta be an order to doing this. Try pokin’\naround some more!
A5_5840_TIM_300_1000	What happens if I push this button?
A5_5840_PIKACHU_300_1000	Nice guess! I think that just released the lock!
A5_5840_TIM_400_1000	If I push this button... Huh? The capsule’s still\nlocked in!
A5_5840_PIKACHU_400_1000	We must’ve gotten the order wrong! Try messing with\nsomething else!
A5_5850_TIM_300_1000	How about this button?!
A5_5850_PIKACHU_300_1000	I think you got it right! Looks like that released\nthe lock!
A5_5850_TIM_400_1000	It didn’t work! I pushed the button, but nothing’s\nhappening!
A5_5850_PIKACHU_400_1000	There must be some other way to work this thing.\nTry poking around somewhere else!
A5_5860_TIM_300_1000	And then the energy capsule... Yes! I got it off\nthe machine!
A5_5860_PIKACHU_300_1000	Well done, Tim.
A5_5860_TIM_400_1000	It’s no good... I can’t get the energy capsule off of\nthis thing!
A5_5860_PIKACHU_400_1000	It must be locked in! We’ve gotta release the lock\nsomehow!
A5_5870_TIM_300_1000	All right! I got it!
A5_5870_PIKACHU_300_1000	Way to go, Tim!
A5_5870_TIM_400_1000	This capsule won’t...move...at all!
A5_5870_PIKACHU_400_1000	It must be locked in somehow. Did you see a release\nmechanism anywhere?
A5_5890_TIM_100_1000	We managed to remove both energy capsules from\nthe machine!
A5_5890_PIKACHU_100_1000	Let’s see if it did anything to Merloch...
A5_Detective.asset
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_100_10	So, the next thing we gotta figure out is how to\nget inside.
A5_Q0110_TIM_100_10	Yeah. The whole place is closed up and locked down.
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_100_20	Since walking in through the front entrance is a\nno-go, let’s think of another way.
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_100_30	Got any bright ideas?
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_200_10	The Pokémon around here might know something.
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_200_20	Let’s ask around.
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_300_10	Did you think up a way to get us inside the building?
A5_Q0110_TIM_400_10	That food wrapper Garbodor found...
A5_Q0110_TIM_400_20	It looked like it’d been discarded pretty recently.
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_400_10	True—and this place does get cleaned regularly.
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_400_20	So that trash couldn’t have been left here that\nlong ago.
A5_Q0110_TIM_400_25	But the janitor said we’re the first people he’s ever\nseen here.
A5_Q0110_TIM_400_30	Maybe the trash blew in from somewhere.
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_400_35	But there aren’t any houses or other facilities nearby.
A5_Q0110_TIM_400_40	Unless...the trash came from inside the lab and got\nblown out here?
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_400_50	Hmm... You might be onto something.
A5_Q0110_TIM_400_50	In that case, if we follow the scent of this wrapper,\nmaybe we can find the entrance!
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_400_70	Yeah. Since it’s relatively new trash, the scent is\nprobably still fresh.
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_400_80	I’d say it’s worth a try!
A5_Q0110_TIM_500_10	What about those small doors Tangela used to get\ninside?
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_500_10	Tim, have you even been paying attention? Those\ndoors are locked!
A5_Q0110_TIM_500_20	Oh yeah, that’s right...
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_500_20	Let’s think of another way...
A5_Q0110_TIM_600_10	Maybe we can use that hole Diglett dug.
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_600_10	You mean crawl through that hole to get inside the\nbuilding?
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_600_20	Love where your head’s at, but don’t you think that\nhole might be too small for us?
A5_Q0110_TIM_600_20	Huh. Now that you mention it, if the hole’s only big\nenough for Diglett, then...yeah.
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_600_30	Hey, don’t look so down, Tim. Let’s just think of some\nother way!
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_800_10	Seems like we don’t have enough information yet.
A5_Q0110_PIKACHU_800_20	Let’s look around the area again.
A5_Q0210_PIKACHU_100_10	Based on that note we saw on the desk, we can safely\nassume that someone was giving instructions.
A5_Q0210_TIM_100_10	But what were the people here actually up to?
A5_Q0210_PIKACHU_100_20	If we can figure that out, we might learn something\nuseful about Unitas.
A5_Q0210_PIKACHU_100_30	Why don’t you tell me what you think, Tim?
A5_Q0210_PIKACHU_200_10	We don’t have enough info yet. Let’s do a careful\nsearch of the building.
A5_Q0210_TIM_200_10	OK. I’ll be careful not to miss anything.
A5_Q0210_PIKACHU_300_10	Did we find any clues about what was going on here?
A5_Q0210_TIM_400_10	The note we found said something about sealing off\na hallway with concrete...
A5_Q0210_PIKACHU_400_10	That must mean there’s a hidden hallway somewhere \non this floor.
A5_Q0210_TIM_400_20	Sealing off a whole hallway seems pretty extreme.
A5_Q0210_PIKACHU_400_20	All the more reason for us to find it!
A5_Q0210_TIM_500_10	Maybe they’ve been using this place as a Pokémon\nplayground?
A5_Q0210_TIM_500_20	That way, their Pokémon could play as much as they\nwanted without anyone else noticing.
A5_Q0210_PIKACHU_500_10	If that’s the case, isn’t it kinda weird that the entrance\nwas so securely locked?
A5_Q0210_PIKACHU_500_20	That’d make it pretty difficult to get back inside for\nrepeat visits.
A5_Q0210_TIM_500_30	Yeah, good point. Let me think this over again.
A5_Q0210_TIM_600_10	There was a chemical stain on the table, right?
A5_Q0210_TIM_600_20	Maybe it’s evidence that someone was researching\nR here?
A5_Q0210_PIKACHU_600_10	Hold up, Tim. We don’t even know if that chemical\nwas R or not.
A5_Q0210_PIKACHU_600_20	And I’ve never heard anything about people\nresearching R in this place.
A5_Q0210_TIM_700_10	Do you think someone has been living here?
A5_Q0210_TIM_700_20	That might explain why there are food wrappers lying\naround.
A5_Q0210_PIKACHU_700_10	I guess it’s not too big a stretch to imagine someone\nsquatting in an abandoned building like this...
A5_Q0210_PIKACHU_700_20	But if that were the case, why would the entrance be\nobstructed the way it was?
A5_Q0210_PIKACHU_700_30	Blocking the entrance like that would make coming\nand going a headache and a half.
A5_Q0210_TIM_700_30	Yeah, guess I was wrong. Let me think this over again.
A5_Q0210_PIKACHU_800_10	Seems like we don’t have enough information yet.
A5_Q0210_PIKACHU_800_20	Let’s look around the area again.
A5_Q0310_PIKACHU_100_10	If Unitas was involved in the jewel theft, what exactly\nwas their motive?
A5_Q0310_TIM_100_10	I’m curious about that too... How were they planning\nto use the Aurora Drop?
A5_Q0310_PIKACHU_100_20	Let’s look back on what we’ve found and think it over.
A5_Q0310_PIKACHU_200_10	Looks like we don’t have enough clues yet. Why don’t\nwe search around some more?
A5_Q0310_PIKACHU_300_10	Find any clues that might help us figure this out?
A5_Q0310_TIM_400_10	Maybe they stole the Aurora Drop to further their\nresearch.
A5_Q0310_TIM_400_20	I mean, take a look at this photo from the experiment\nreport, and this photo of the Aurora Drop.
A5_Q0310_PIKACHU_400_10	It’s the same jewel!
A5_Q0310_TIM_400_30	Seems like they’ve been doing a lot of research about\nthat jewel. But what in the world for?
A5_Q0310_PIKACHU_400_20	If we keep investigating this facility, I’m pretty sure\nwe’ll find out one way or another.
A5_Q0310_TIM_500_10	Do you think they might’ve stolen it because they\nneeded more funding?
A5_Q0310_TIM_500_20	I mean, if that business plan is any indication, it looks\nlike their research is eating up an awful lot of cash.
A5_Q0310_PIKACHU_500_10	But the plan didn’t mention anything about a lack of\nfunds, did it?
A5_Q0310_TIM_500_30	Now that you mention it...no, it didn’t. Let me think\nthis over again.
A5_Q0310_TIM_600_10	I guess they could’ve stolen it to feed Sableye...
A5_Q0310_TIM_600_20	Remember what they wrote on the back of that photo\nof Sableye? “It eats jewels, so watch out.”
A5_Q0310_PIKACHU_600_10	I’m gonna stop you right there, Tim.
A5_Q0310_PIKACHU_600_20	If they’d been planning to feed it to Sableye, then\nwhat would they have to “watch out” for?
A5_Q0310_TIM_600_30	Ah, good point. Let me think this over again.
A5_Q0310_PIKACHU_800_10	Seems like we don’t have enough information yet.
A5_Q0310_PIKACHU_800_20	Let’s look around the area again.
A5_Q0410_TIM_100_10	There was no passcode in here, so I guess we can\nconclude that this isn’t the standby room.
A5_Q0410_PIKACHU_100_10	In which case, the passcode oughta be in the room\nnext to this one.
A5_Q0410_TIM_100_20	But Unitas members are in there, right?
A5_Q0410_PIKACHU_100_20	Yeah. We gotta figure out a way to get ’em out.
A5_Q0410_PIKACHU_100_30	Let’s look back on what we’ve found so far and come\nup with a plan.
A5_Q0410_PIKACHU_200_10	Looks like we don’t have enough clues yet. Let’s roll\nup our sleeves and find some more.
A5_Q0410_PIKACHU_300_10	Find any clues that might help us figure this out?
A5_Q0410_TIM_400_10	What if we use the intercom to report that a Pokémon\nhas escaped?
A5_Q0410_TIM_400_20	A notice on the wall said that if a Pokémon escapes,\neveryone’s supposed to drop what they’re doing and\ntry to recapture it.
A5_Q0410_TIM_400_30	So if we told a little white lie over the intercom...
A5_Q0410_PIKACHU_400_10	...Everyone in that room would freak out and rush\noutta there!
A5_Q0410_TIM_400_40	Yep. And while they’re out, we can sneak inside and\nsearch the room.
A5_Q0410_TIM_500_10	What if we use the intercom to report a fire in the\nfacility?
A5_Q0410_TIM_500_20	Everyone in that room would rush out of there, right?
A5_Q0410_PIKACHU_500_10	No, Tim. Think about it.
A5_Q0410_PIKACHU_500_20	The notice on the wall said that an alarm goes off\nduring emergencies.
A5_Q0410_PIKACHU_500_30	Don’t you think they’ll realize something’s up if that\nalarm’s not sounding?
A5_Q0410_TIM_500_30	Now that you mention it... Yeah, let me think again.
A5_Q0410_TIM_600_10	Maybe we could wait until it’s time for the cubes’\nmaintenance inspection?
A5_Q0410_TIM_600_20	Remember? That notice on the wall said they get\nchecked every night.
A5_Q0410_PIKACHU_600_10	I seriously doubt we’ve got that much time to wait.
A5_Q0410_PIKACHU_600_20	And even if we did, there’s a decent chance we’d be\nfound before then.
A5_Q0410_TIM_600_30	Point taken. Let me rethink this.
A5_Q0410_TIM_700_10	You know, we’ve got enough Pokémon on our side\nthat we could take the passcode by force.
A5_Q0410_PIKACHU_700_10	Whoa, whoa! That plan just took a sharp turn into the\ndanger zone!
A5_Q0410_TIM_700_20	But we know the passcode is in that room.
A5_Q0410_TIM_700_30	If we all worked together, I bet we could manage it.
A5_Q0410_PIKACHU_700_20	Sure, we could take ’em. But as soon as they call for\nbackup, it’s game over.
A5_Q0410_PIKACHU_700_30	Let’s think of another way.
A5_Q0410_PIKACHU_800_10	Seems like we don’t have enough information yet.
A5_Q0410_PIKACHU_800_20	Let’s look around the area again.
A5_Q0510_TIM_100_10	Unitas went to the ruins for a reason...
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_100_20	Let’s deduce their goal from the clues we found in\nthis room.
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_200_10	Looks like we don’t have enough clues yet. Let’s roll\nup our sleeves and find some more.
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_300_10	Did we find any clues that could help us figure out\nUnitas’s goal?
A5_Q0510_TIM_400_10	Do you suppose they could’ve gone there to look for\nan energy source?
A5_Q0510_TIM_400_20	We read that the meteorites with high concentrations\nof energy were delivered downstairs for use.
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_400_10	Yeah, and that reference doc said lots of meteorites\ncould be found around the ruins.
A5_Q0510_TIM_400_30	Right. So, I think Unitas was at the ruins to collect\nmeteorites they could use as an energy source.
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_400_20	That seems most likely.
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_400_30	But what the heck are they planning to DO with that\nenergy?
A5_Q0510_TIM_500_10	I guess they could’ve been there to collect materials\nfor repairing this facility.
A5_Q0510_TIM_500_20	After all, that document we found basically said this\nplace is falling apart.
A5_Q0510_TIM_500_30	And since the meteorites are so hard, they might be\nuseful as building materials.
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_500_10	Now hold the phone, Tim.
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_500_20	We also read that the meteorites are so hard they\ncan’t be crushed. Remember?
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_500_30	I doubt Unitas would go outta their way to gather\nconstruction materials THAT difficult to work with.
A5_Q0510_TIM_500_40	You’re probably right. I’ll try thinking it over again.
A5_Q0510_TIM_600_10	Maybe they came to train some of their newer\nsubordinates.
A5_Q0510_TIM_600_20	I mean, we saw a performance review here, right?
A5_Q0510_TIM_600_30	So I bet they went to the ruins for training purposes.
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_600_10	You sure about that?
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_600_20	That paper only mentioned a mission, Tim. It didn’t\nsay anything about training.
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_600_30	I’m curious about what that mission was.
A5_Q0510_TIM_600_40	Yeah, you’re right. Let me think about this again.
A5_Q0510_TIM_700_10	Hmm. Do you think they were researching the ruins\nthemselves?
A5_Q0510_TIM_700_20	We saw some documents about the ruins, right?
A5_Q0510_TIM_700_30	So maybe they were conducting an archeological\nsurvey, like Professor Gordon was.
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_700_10	I don’t feel like we’ve got enough proof to say that.
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_700_20	And if Unitas was just there doing research, why’d\nthey attack us?
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_700_30	They must’ve had another reason for being there.\nLet’s think this over again.
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_800_10	Seems like we don’t have enough information yet.
A5_Q0510_PIKACHU_800_20	Let’s look around the area again.
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_100_10	We need to get down to the next floor, but we can’t\ntake the stairs OR use the elevator.
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_100_20	We gotta think of a third option for getting down\nthere.
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_100_30	Let’s brainstorm what we can do. I’m open to any\nideas, no matter how extreme they might be.
A5_Q0610_TIM_100_10	Right... There’s gotta be a way through...
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_200_10	First, let’s check everything on this floor that we can.
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_300_10	Did you think of a way to get down to the next floor?
A5_Q0610_TIM_400_10	Maybe we could ask Excadrill to drill a hole through\nthe floor.
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_400_10	Aw yeah! I bet Excadrill could carve out a mean hole\nfor us!
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_400_20	And if we take it to that section of the floor Hariyama\nalready damaged? Why, it could dig through that in\nno time flat.
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_400_30	I’m sold! Let’s hit up Excadrill for help!
A5_Q0610_TIM_500_10	If we ask Hariyama to smash through the floor, we\nmight be able to get down that way.
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_500_10	Maybe...but don’t you think that’d take a while?
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_500_20	With those Unitas stooges nearby, we can’t exactly\nafford to take our time.
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_500_30	Don’t get me wrong—the idea’s got merit. But can\nyou think of something a little more efficient?
A5_Q0610_TIM_600_10	Maybe we could get a Unitas guard to tell us the\npasscode...
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_600_10	Well, the one who changed the passcode already\nwent downstairs.
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_600_20	I’m guessing the one on this floor doesn’t even know\nthe updated passcode.
A5_Q0610_TIM_600_20	Oh, yeah... Then I guess we’d better come up with\nsomething else.
A5_Q0610_TIM_700_10	Maybe the reason we couldn’t find a card key is\nbecause Cramorant swallowed it?
A5_Q0610_TIM_700_20	So if we got him to spit it up, we’d be able to take the\nstairs down...
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_700_10	Except when Cramorant spit up the controller, that’s\nthe only thing he spit up—nothing else came out.
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_700_20	Wait, what gave you the idea that Cramorant even\nswallowed the card key in the first place?
A5_Q0610_TIM_700_30	I...I don’t know. I guess I’ll think it over some more.
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_800_10	Maybe we don’t have enough clues...
A5_Q0610_PIKACHU_800_20	We should interview Pokémon and look around the\nroom to get more info.
A5_Q0710_TIM_100_10	Butler was mainly capturing Pokémon, wasn’t he?
A5_Q0710_PIKACHU_100_10	Right. But WHY did Unitas want him to do that?
A5_Q0710_PIKACHU_100_20	I wanna mull this one over—it might put us in the right\nheadspace to figure out what Howard’s hoping to do.
A5_Q0710_PIKACHU_100_30	What do you think, Tim?
A5_Q0710_PIKACHU_200_10	There might be a clue on the desk.
A5_Q0710_TIM_200_10	Yeah, I’ll try to find some more information.
A5_Q0710_PIKACHU_300_10	So, have you figured out why Unitas has been\ncapturing and detaining Pokémon?
A5_Q0710_TIM_400_10	The cube experiment report said they needed data\nabout Pokémon.
A5_Q0710_TIM_400_20	So maybe they were collecting Pokémon to help them\nperfect the cubes they’d been developing.
A5_Q0710_PIKACHU_400_10	That adds up—the list of Pokémon that got sent here\nmatches the list of Pokémon they experimented on.
A5_Q0710_TIM_400_30	They must’ve been testing the cubes out on all sorts\nof different Pokémon.
A5_Q0710_PIKACHU_400_20	I guess they wanted to make sure the cubes were\ncompatible with every kind of Pokémon.
A5_Q0710_PIKACHU_400_30	If the cubes failed to work on even a single Pokémon\nspecies, the entire operation would be a bust.
A5_Q0710_PIKACHU_400_40	The developers must’ve been desperate to perfect the\ncubes—by any means necessary.
A5_Q0710_TIM_500_10	Maybe they were capturing Pokémon as a way of\ndistributing the cubes.
A5_Q0710_PIKACHU_500_10	Huh? You mean they’re releasing Pokémon back into\nthe city with cubes on their backs?
A5_Q0710_PIKACHU_500_20	But the captured Pokémon on that list have been\nlocked up here the whole time.
A5_Q0710_TIM_500_20	Hmm. Then I guess there’s some other reason...
A5_Q0710_TIM_600_10	Maybe they’ve been selling Pokémon on the black\nmarket.
A5_Q0710_PIKACHU_600_10	Then why would they pay Butler all that money to\ncapture those Pokémon in the first place?
A5_Q0710_PIKACHU_600_20	That doesn’t make sense if Unitas was just looking to\nturn a quick profit.
A5_Q0710_TIM_600_20	Hmm. Then I guess there’s some other reason...
A5_Q0710_PIKACHU_800_10	Seems like we don’t have enough information yet.
A5_Q0710_PIKACHU_800_20	Let’s see if there’s anything on the desk again.
A5_Q0810_PIKACHU_100_10	Unitas must’ve had a reason for going after Jessica.
A5_Q0810_TIM_100_10	Yeah... But what, exactly?
A5_Q0810_PIKACHU_100_20	Let’s look for clues on this floor and start deducing.
A5_Q0810_PIKACHU_200_10	First, let’s look for some clues.
A5_Q0810_PIKACHU_300_10	Did you find enough clues?
A5_Q0810_TIM_400_10	Merloch needed the research data Jessica was\nholding on to.
A5_Q0810_PIKACHU_400_10	Jessica had Emma’s research data—and that’s why\nshe was targeted.
A5_Q0810_PIKACHU_400_20	That data’s being used to research something OTHER\nthan the cubes...
A5_Q0810_TIM_400_20	I’ve got a bad feeling about this.
A5_Q0810_TIM_500_10	The mayor’s plan was supposed to be confidential.\nMaybe they were trying to silence anyone who knew\ntoo much about it.
A5_Q0810_PIKACHU_500_10	But he’s about to make a public announcement about\ndistributing the cubes in his speech.
A5_Q0810_PIKACHU_500_20	Would it really be such a huge problem if people\nfound out a little early?
A5_Q0810_TIM_500_20	Hmm, good point... I’ll try to consider another\npossibility.
A5_Q0810_TIM_600_10	Well, Unitas has been collecting energy...
A5_Q0810_PIKACHU_600_10	Are you saying Jessica got in their way?
A5_Q0810_PIKACHU_600_20	But Unitas didn’t take any of the bamboo charcoal,\nremember?
A5_Q0810_PIKACHU_600_30	Besides, no way could they power this underground\nfacility with charcoal—there’s not even a chimney!
A5_Q0810_TIM_600_20	Yeah, you’re right... Guess that wasn’t the answer.
A5_Q0810_PIKACHU_800_10	Hmm... I feel like we must’ve missed something.
A5_Q0810_PIKACHU_800_20	Let’s investigate this floor a little more.
A5_Drama.asset
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_100_10	OK! There’s something I gotta do.\nI’ll meet you there!
A5_Drama_TIM_100_10	Wait, what?
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_100_20	Heh! You’ll like it, I promise!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_100_30	Oh, that’s right! We’re outta coffee\nbeans. Can you pick some up?
A5_Drama_SOPHIA_100_10	OK! The usual dark roast, right?
A5_Drama_TIM_100_15	Yeah.
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_100_35	Yeah.
A5_Drama_TIM_100_20	Eh?
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_100_40_NOMESSAGE	Huh?!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_100_50	Sophia... You can...
A5_Drama_SOPHIA_100_20	Uh-huh! I’ve understood you this whole time!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_100_60	Now that’s my little girl!
A5_Drama_TIM_100_30	Ahh, we don’t have time for this!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_100_70	OK, OK, OK!
A5_Drama_TIM_100_40	See you later!
A5_Drama_SOPHIA_100_30_NOMESSAGE	(small puzzled react)
A5_Drama_TIM_200_10	It looks like he’s late...\nWhat do you think Pikachu’s up to?
A5_Drama_RACHEL_200_10	Tim, uh... Why are you still\ncalling your father “Pikachu”?
A5_Drama_TIM_200_20	Well...it’s hard for me to call\nhim “Dad” to his face.
A5_Drama_TIM_200_30	I mean, he still looks like a Pikachu.
A5_Drama_RACHEL_200_20	When you put it like that,\nit does sound awkward.
A5_Drama_RACHEL_200_30	There he is!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_200_10	Hey! Sorry for the wait!
A5_Drama_GARDIE_200_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)
A5_Drama_GHIHIDARUMA_200_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)
A5_Drama_RENTORAR_200_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)
A5_Drama_GORONDA_200_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)
A5_Drama_TIM_200_40	You all came to help! Thank you!
A5_Drama_RACHEL_200_40	Wow, Pikachu! You have so many friends!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_200_20	This ragtag crew is my entourage!
A5_Drama_GARDIE_200_20_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)\n(What did you call us?!)
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_200_30	Wah!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_200_40	Ow ow ow ow...
A5_Drama_RACHEL_200_50	Whoa, what? Did I miss something?
A5_Drama_TIM_200_50	Oh, Pikachu said—
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_200_50	Tim! There’s no time for that—\nwe’ve got work to do!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_300_10	Oof!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_300_30	Hey, Cramorant! You’re in there, yeah?
A5_Drama_UU_300_10	(Aw geez! They found me!)
A5_Drama_UU_300_20_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cries - distressed)
A5_Drama_UU_300_30_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - distressed)
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_300_40	Hey, wait! Calm down!
A5_Drama_UU_300_40	(Ohhh! I know yooouuu. We met before, yeah?)
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_300_50	That’s right. I saw you gulp down\nthe Aurora Drop, remember?
A5_Drama_UU_300_50	(I dunno. I just don’t knooow...)
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_300_60	Yeah, that’s because you were being controlled.
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_300_70	So anyway... Tell me why you’re being chased.
A5_Drama_UU_300_60	(I just, like, wanted to see Turner! So I ran away!)
A5_Drama_UU_300_70	(Then I swallowed somethin’. Next thing I know,\nit’s all “whoa!” and “WHOA!” and “whoa...”)
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_300_80	Huh? What did you swallow?
A5_Drama_UU_300_80_NOMESSAGE	(hacks up controller)
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_300_90	Ugh! Seriously?
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_300_100	Hm?

A5_Drama_PIKACHU_500_20	C’mon! Let’s go!
A5_Drama_RENTORAR_500_20	(I think I’m staying right here.)
A5_Drama_HELLGAR_500_10	(There you are!)
A5_Drama_TIM_500_10	Pikachu!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_500_30	Ahhh!

A5_Drama_RENTORAR_500_50_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - sizing up the situation)
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_600_10	Oh no... You’re not planning to stay behind too?
A5_Drama_GHIHIDARUMA_600_10	(Yep...)

A5_Drama_PIKACHU_600_30	W-wait...
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_600_35	You can’t!
A5_Drama_GHIHIDARUMA_600_20	(We had lots of fun!)
A5_Drama_GORONDA_600_20	(Thanks...)
A5_Drama_HELLGAR_600_5_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - running sounds to movement)
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_600_40_NOMESSAGE	(struggling to get to his feet)
A5_Drama_HELLGAR_600_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - intimidating, about to attack)
A5_Drama_GORONDA_600_30_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry - defiant, bring it on!)
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_600_50	You guys...
A5_Drama_TIM_600_20	Pikachu...
A5_Drama_RACHEL_700_10	You KNOW this wasn’t Mama’s dream!
A5_Drama_HOWARD_700_10	Rachel?
A5_Drama_RACHEL_700_20	Papa... Don’t you remember?
A5_Drama_RACHEL_700_30	When I was little...and got lost\nin Bamboo Borough...
A5_Drama_RACHEL_700_40	an Ursaring saved me.
A5_Drama_RACHEL_700_60	I was afraid...and crying.
A5_Drama_RACHEL_700_70	And since it was worried for my safety,
A5_Drama_RACHEL_700_80	the Ursaring chose to rescue me.
A5_Drama_RACHEL_700_90	All Pokémon have free will\nand can think for themselves!
A5_Drama_RACHEL_700_100	But you’re trying to impose your will onto theirs...
A5_Drama_RACHEL_700_110	Do you really believe that’s right?
A5_Drama_RACHEL_700_120	How can you claim to coexist with Pokémon\nif you take away their free will?
A5_Drama_HOWARD_700_20	... ... ...
A5_Drama_RACHEL_700_130	Is that really the future you want for Ryme City?
A5_Drama_RACHEL_700_140	Because...Mama’s dream for people\nand Pokémon was nothing like this!
A5_Drama_RACHEL_700_150	And if she knew... If Mama saw this...
A5_Drama_RACHEL_700_160	You just can’t do this, Papa!
A5_Drama_HOWARD_700_30	Rachel...
A5_Drama_HOWARD_700_40	I didn’t realize...what the\nFriendship Cubes were really doing.
A5_Drama_HOWARD_700_50	I see now that I was wrong.
A5_Drama_HOWARD_700_60	I’m sorry...
A5_Drama_HOWARD_700_70	Rachel.
A5_Drama_TIM_800_10	The one behind this...
A5_Drama_TIM_800_20	Mr. Merloch!
A5_Drama_TIM_800_30	You’re the culprit!
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_800_10	Argh! Will you shut up?!
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_800_20	I have to say, I am incredibly\ndisappointed in you, Mayor Myers.
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_800_30	You know you’re playing right\ninto Pokémon’s hands, don’t you?
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_800_40	Ryme City’s a lost cause if you can’t\neven protect your only daughter.
A5_Drama_HOWARD_800_10	What did you say?
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_800_50_NOMESSAGE	... (Go.)
A5_Drama_HOWARD_800_20	Merloch!
A5_Drama_HOWARD_800_30	You were deceiving me?!
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_800_60	Your role in this has come to an end, Mayor.
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_800_70	As for the great detective duo...
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_800_80	I knew you were good, but even I’m\nimpressed you made it all the way here.
A5_Drama_TIM_800_40	Mr. Merloch!
A5_Drama_TIM_800_50	Those cubes will never be\nused again. Give up already!
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_800_90_NOMESSAGE	Ha ha ha!
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_800_100_NOMESSAGE	Hee hee hee...
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_800_10_NOMESSAGE	Huh?
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_800_110	You really think I care about that plan?\nIt was nothing more than a means to an end!
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_800_120	Behold! THIS is the masterpiece\nthat I’ve truly been creating!
A5_Drama_TIM_800_60	You mean, this has nothing to do with the cubes?
A5_Drama_TIM_800_70	We saw the meteorite and\nthe Aurora Drop in the lab...
A5_Drama_TIM_800_80	Do those have something to do\nwith my dad and Pikachu?!
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_800_130	Excuse me? You dared to snoop\nthrough my research?
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_800_140	*scoff* Common rabble like you\nwouldn’t understand it anyway.
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_800_150	Explaining it would be pointless.\nJust pay attention.
A5_Drama_TIM_800_90	Pay attention?
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_800_20	I’ve got a bad feeling about this...
A5_Drama_GORONDA_900_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_900_10	You guys! You’re all right!
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_900_10	Here they are...
A5_Drama_TIM_900_10	Pikachu!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_900_20	Huh?
A5_Drama_GORONDA_900_20_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)\n(Gotcha!)
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_900_30	Gwah! What do you think you’re doing?!
A5_Drama_GORONDA_900_30_NOMESSAGE	(Pokémon cry) (Stop struggling.)
A5_Drama_TIM_900_20	But why, Pangoro?
A5_Drama_RACHEL_900_5_NOMESSAGE	(no subtitle)
A5_Drama_RACHEL_900_10	Tim! Look!
A5_Drama_TIM_900_25_NOMESSAGE	(no subtitle)
A5_Drama_TIM_900_30	Of course! They’re all being controlled!
A5_Drama_GARDIE_900_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)\n(I’ll bite you!)

A5_Drama_PIKACHU_900_55_NOMESSAGE	(exertion sounds to movement)
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_900_60	Merloch! Lemme out! Hey!
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_900_20	OK... It seems I’ve got everything I need.
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_900_30	Now it’s time to get this show started!
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_1000_10	I believe you may recognize this.
A5_Drama_TIM_1000_10	The Aurora Drop!
A5_Drama_TIM_1000_20	What’re you—?! What are\nyou gonna do with that?!
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_1000_20	Easy—!
A5_Drama_GARDIE_1000_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)\n(Don’t try anything stupid!)
A5_Drama_RENTORAR_1000_10_NOMESSAGE	(PKMN cry)\n(Don’t move from that spot.)
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_1000_30	Now, at last...
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_1000_40	At long last...
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_1000_50	Ohhh!
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_1000_60	It worked!
A5_Drama_TIM_1000_30	A Pokémon?
A5_Drama_RACHEL_1000_10	Wait, hold on a minute...
A5_Drama_RACHEL_1000_20	What Professor Gordon said—about\nthe Pokémon from space?
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_1000_70	Deoxys has returned!
A5_Drama_HOWARD_1000_10	This can’t be happening.
A5_Drama_HOWARD_1000_20	And to think...I was complicit\nin this madman’s plan!
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_1000_80	Oh, the best is yet to come!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1000_10	Aaahhh!!!
A5_Drama_TIM_1000_40	Pikachu!
A5_Drama_TIM_1000_50	Merloch, let him go!!!
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_1000_90	Oh, I’ve come too far to stop now.
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_1000_100	The Sleeping Man
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_1000_110	and Detective Pikachu both\nbrought me the energy I need.
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_1000_120	When these two energies come together as one,\nall of my research, all of my dreams...
A5_Drama_MURDOCH_1000_130	will finally become reality!
A5_Drama_TIM_1000_60	What is he doing?
A5_Drama_DEOXYS_1000_10	Hi there, Tim.
A5_Drama_RACHEL_1000_30	Wh-what?
A5_Drama_TIM_1000_70	Don’t tell me Merloch just...
A5_Drama_DEOXYS_1000_20	Yes! This is the answer!
A5_Drama_RACHEL_1000_40	How can a person become a Pokémon?
A5_Drama_HOWARD_1000_30	How horrifying...
A5_Drama_DEOXYS_1000_30	The best way for humans\nto understand Pokémon...
A5_Drama_DEOXYS_1000_40	is for them to become Pokémon themselves!\nA union of human and Pokémon—
A5_Drama_DEOXYS_1000_50	THIS is the true meaning of “coexistence”!

A5_Drama_DEOXYS_1100_90	Incredible... I can feel the power\nwelling up within me!
A5_Drama_DEOXYS_1100_100	So this is what it’s like to be a Pokémon!
A5_Drama_DEOXYS_1100_110	I think it’s time for me\nto enjoy the outside world.
A5_Drama_TIM_1100_20	Wait!
A5_Drama_DEOXYS_1100_120	I’ll be seeing you.
A5_Drama_TIM_1100_30_NOMESSAGE	(grunt)
A5_Drama_RACHEL_1100_10_NOMESSAGE	Wah!
A5_Drama_RACHEL_1100_20	What now?
A5_Drama_TIM_1100_40	We’ve gotta do something.
A5_Drama_TIM_1100_50	But first, I need to help Pikachu!
A5_Drama_TIM_1100_60	What’s that?
A5_Drama_RACHEL_1100_25_NOMESSAGE	(reacting to room shaking)

A5_Drama_RACHEL_1100_40_NOMESSAGE	(frightened noises)
A5_Drama_HOWARD_1100_10	What’s happening?
A5_Drama_TIM_1100_80	Mewtwo!
A5_Drama_MEWTWO_1200_10	I cannot imagine why, but I sense a human’s\npresence within that Pokémon.
A5_Drama_MEWTWO_1200_20	Tell me. What has happened?
A5_Drama_TIM_1200_10	That guy used the energy in\nDad and Pikachu to become...
A5_Drama_TIM_1200_20	Deoxys!
A5_Drama_MEWTWO_1200_30	Is that so?
A5_Drama_MEWTWO_1200_40	Not only has he misused my energy,\nhe is using a Pokémon for his—

A5_Drama_TIM_1200_40	This lab’s going to collapse\nbefore either one of them wins!
A5_Drama_TIM_1200_50	We need to get somewhere safe...

A5_Drama_TIM_1200_60	That’s it! Rachel, Mr. Myers...

A5_Drama_TIM_1200_80	I’ll save Pikachu!
A5_Drama_RACHEL_1200_25	OK.
A5_Drama_RACHEL_1200_30	Growlithe and the others might be hurt.\nI’ll take care of them!
A5_Drama_RACHEL_1200_40	C’mon, Papa! Let’s go!
A5_Drama_HOWARD_1200_10	Right.
A5_Drama_HOWARD_1200_20	Tim... You be careful.
A5_Drama_TIM_1200_90	I will!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_5_NOMESSAGE	(no subtitle)
A5_Drama_TIM_1300_10	Pikachu!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_10	Wow, that was intense...but it looks\nlike both me and Pikachu are OK.
A5_Drama_TIM_1300_20	What a relief...
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_20	I gotta say, looks like the\nparty’s in full swing.
A5_Drama_TIM_1300_30	Believe it or not, it’s Merloch.
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_30	Yeah, I know... Looks like he’s become a Pokémon.
A5_Drama_TIM_1300_40	We have to stop him somehow.
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_40	I can’t imagine Mewtwo losing...
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_50	But we humans caused this mess.\nWe’re the ones who’ve gotta clean it up!
A5_Drama_TIM_1300_50	Yeah. What about your body?
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_60	I look safe enough in there.
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_70	Anyway, let’s hurry.
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_80_NOMESSAGE	(jumping down exert)
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_90	Wah...oh!

A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1300_100	Yeah...
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_10	Deoxys flying around... The busted fusion machine...\nAnd then there’s me—the great Detective Pikachu...
A5_Drama_TIM_1400_10	What are you thinking, Pikachu?
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_20	Aha! I think I’ve got it!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_30	A bolt of brilliance!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_40	I’ll jump up from the top of this machine\nand hit Deoxys with the energy!
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_50	Oh? How very thoughtful.
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_60_NOMESSAGE	(sipping sound)
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1400_70	Time to close this case!

A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1500_20	Phew...
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1500_30	If we take the elevator, I should\nbe able to get over there.
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1500_40	’Kay, hand ’em over, Tim.
A5_Drama_TIM_1500_20	Yeah.
A5_Drama_TIM_1500_30	There.
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1500_50	Looks like we’re ready to go, so...hit it!
A5_Drama_TIM_1500_40	Hm...
A5_Drama_TIM_1500_50	You’re sure you can do this?
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1500_60	You mean hit Deoxys in midair\nwith two capsules of energy?
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1500_70	You can’t do that.\nOnly I can do this.
A5_Drama_TIM_1500_60	Yeah, I know. It’s just...\nIsn’t there another way?
A5_Drama_PIKACHU_1500_80	C’mon... Who do you think I am, Tim?

A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_100_10	When you were in high school, Tim...
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_100_20	We’d go fishing on West Lake\nin Leaventown, remember?
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_100_30	What? You don’t...?
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_200_10	Agh... Why’d I go and tell\nIrene I wanted a divorce?
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_200_20	I should apologize to her.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_200_30	If I do, maybe she’ll forgive and forget.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_300_10	Hey, about Sophia...\nShe’s headstrong, just like Irene.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_300_20	If anything happens, you\nneed to look out for her.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_400_10	Will returning to a human body\nreally make me happy?
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_400_20	Maybe I can still be happy if I keep\nliving as a Pokémon, you know?
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_400_30	That’s been on my mind\nsince yesterday.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_500_10	How about this one?
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_500_20	On Sophia’s first birthday, we had\na family barbecue.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_500_30	What?! You don’t remember\nthat, either?!
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_600_10	Y’know, Ryme City was a good city.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_600_20	But ever since the R incident, feels like\neverything’s been thrown outta whack...
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_700_10	Remember Roger—the guy behind the\nR incident? Guess what he’s up to now.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_700_20	Word is, he’s been doing volunteer work.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_700_30	Guess he feels a little remorse.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_800_10	Hey, remember Graham?
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_800_20	The president of GNN.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_800_30	Apparently he’s the honorary chair now.\nWho’d have thought, huh?
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1000_10	By the way, Tim...
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1000_20	After I went missing, how did\nIrene seem to be doing?
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1100_10	This lab isn’t closed at all... It looks like\nthey never even slowed down their work!
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1100_20	Keep your wits about you, Tim!
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1200_10	Why do I call myself a\ngreat detective?
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1200_20	Well, saying it helps me get\ncloser to actually being one,\neven if it’s just a little bit.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1200_30	Nothing more than that, really.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1300_10	Tim...
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1300_20	Y’know how Sophia said she could\nunderstand what I was saying all along?
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1300_30	Wonder why she never brought it up...
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1400_10	Tim...
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1400_20	If I manage to get my old body back, I want\nus all to live together as a family again.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1400_30	With Pikachu too, of course.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1500_10	Listen, Tim. If anything happens, you\nkeep Rachel and the Pokémon safe!
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1500_20	That’s your main duty!
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1600_10	Seriously, thanks for coming all\nthis way to help, Growlithe!
A5_PikaTalk_GARDIE_1600_10	(Of course! You helped clear my name!)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1600_20	Sure, but still... Thanks.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1700_10	I’m counting on that nose of yours!
A5_PikaTalk_GARDIE_1700_10	(You got it!)
A5_PikaTalk_GARDIE_1700_20	(I’ll show you what I can do!)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1800_10	Oof... Sorry, Growlithe.\nIt’s happening again...
A5_PikaTalk_GARDIE_1800_10	(What’s up? You know we’re in\na hurry, right?)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1800_20	All the bouncing’s got me feeling...\na little queasy...
A5_PikaTalk_GARDIE_1800_20	(Ack! Get off me, then!)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1800_30	Whoaaaa!
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1900_10	Thanks so much for coming, Darmanitan.
A5_PikaTalk_GHIHIDARUMA_1900_10	(You saved Eiscue and the others.\nOf course I was gonna help!)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_1900_20	Thanks. We could really use a hand.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2000_10	How’re you feeling, Darmanitan?
A5_PikaTalk_GHIHIDARUMA_2000_10	(You’re gonna get even with the\nguys who brought us here, right?)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2000_20	That’s the plan. And we need your help.
A5_PikaTalk_GHIHIDARUMA_2000_20	(I’ve gotta get ’em back for Eiscue\nand the others! I won’t let you down!)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2000_30	That’s the spirit!
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2100_10	It’s been a while since our\nlast ride together, huh?
A5_PikaTalk_GHIHIDARUMA_2100_10	(Yeah.)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2100_20	Just sayin’, though—the\nride’s still pretty bumpy.
A5_PikaTalk_GHIHIDARUMA_2100_20	(Oh?)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2100_30	I mean...could you at least try running\na bit more smoothly? It’s so bumpy I\nfeel like I’m gonna bite my tongue!
A5_PikaTalk_GHIHIDARUMA_2100_30	(That’s just how I run.)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2100_40	I know, buddy, I know.\nBut what I’m saying is—
A5_PikaTalk_GHIHIDARUMA_2100_40	(It’s the only way I can run!)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2100_50	Can’t you at least give it a try?\nC’mon, Darmanitan!
A5_PikaTalk_GHIHIDARUMA_2100_50	(Don’t like it? Then get off!)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2100_60	Gwaaah!
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2200_10	Luxray, were you able to see Mightyena?
A5_PikaTalk_RENTORAR_2200_10	(Yes, thanks to you. I appreciate it.)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2200_20	Hey, no sweat!
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2300_10	Thanks for showing up!\nI appreciate the help.
A5_PikaTalk_RENTORAR_2300_10	(You don’t have to thank me.)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2300_20	I guess, but...I’m just so thankful!
A5_PikaTalk_RENTORAR_2300_20	(Quiet! I can’t focus with\nyou yapping in my ear.)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2300_30	R-right, sorry...
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2400_10	Hey, Luxray. I was thinking...\nYour special vision would be a\nhuge asset to my detective work.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2400_20	When this case is finished, would you\nbe up to working together again?
A5_PikaTalk_RENTORAR_2400_10	(I’ll pass.)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2400_30	Awww, how come?
A5_PikaTalk_RENTORAR_2400_20	(You helped me, so I’m helping you.\nI don’t plan on keeping in touch.)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2400_40	C’mon, I thought we were bros!
A5_PikaTalk_RENTORAR_2400_30	(My mind is made up.)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2400_50	Please please please please pleeeeease!
A5_PikaTalk_RENTORAR_2400_40	(Enough!)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2400_60	Uwaaaaaaagh!
A5_PikaTalk_UPAH_2800_10	(Will everything be OK...?)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2800_10	Don’t worry—I’m gonna solve this case\nsoon so you can go back home!
A5_PikaTalk_UPAH_2800_20	(Thanks!)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2800_20	Hang in there.
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2900_10	You OK? I’m glad you\ncame to your senses.
A5_PikaTalk_YONOIR_2900_10	(... ... ...)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2900_20	S-since you’re not attacking me,\nyou must be back to normal...right?
A5_PikaTalk_YONOIR_2900_20	(... ... ...)
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_2900_30	... ... ...
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_3000_10	Hey, Tim!\nPay attention, will you?
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_3000_20	Honestly... I know I didn’t raise\nyou to be so absent-minded!
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_3100_10	We don’t know what might\nbe waiting for us, Tim! Keep\nyour guard up, all right?
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_3200_10	There must be some deep connection\nbetween Unitas and the mayor...
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_3300_10	I can feel it... Harry’s body—my body!—\nis somewhere in this building!
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_3400_10	I’m sure this place holds the\nanswers to all the mysteries!
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_3500_10	There’s no turning back now.\nLet’s press onward!
A5_PikaTalk_PIKACHU_3600_10	Huh? What in the world? Is that a tail?!\n...Oh, right. I’m a Pikachu.

A5_SRT_EMILIA_3900_40	Expectations are high for this device,\nwhich is meant to bring people and\nPokémon closer together.
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_3900_10	Tonight, huh...
A5_SRT_TIM_3900_10	Do you think Mayor Myers is really\nconnected to Unitas?
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_4300_10	The abandoned Pokémon Unity Lab...\nI bet we’ll find all the answers there.
A5_SRT_TIM_4300_10	Don’t forget—we also need\nto get Dad’s body back.
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_4300_20	Right!
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_4300_30	It’s gonna be a long day.\nMake sure you’re all prepped, Tim!
A5_SRT_TIM_4300_20	Mm-hm!
A5_SRT_SOPHIA_4400_10	Pikachu seems different\nfrom his usual self...
A5_SRT_TIM_4400_10	Different how?
A5_SRT_SOPHIA_4400_20	It just seems like he’s got,\nI dunno...old-man energy now.
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_4400_10	What?!
A5_SRT_IRENE_4400_10	Really? He’s always\nseemed like that to me.
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_4400_15	Gah!
A5_SRT_SOPHIA_4400_30	Ah! Not old! Experienced!\nLike an experienced great detective!
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_4400_20	Am I really acting older since\nI got my memories back?

A5_SRT_LHENEMY01_1100_10	Hey, did you remember to\nturn in the Aurora Drop?
A5_SRT_LAENEMYWOMAN01_1100_10	Yeah, I just dropped it off.
A5_SRT_LAENEMYWOMAN01_1100_20	Wasn’t easy to get, though.\nCramorant just refused to cough it up...
A5_SRT_LHENEMYWOMANDARK01_1100_10	What are you all doing here?
A5_SRT_LHENEMYWOMANDARK01_1100_20	The mayor is here today to\ninspect the production line.
A5_SRT_LHENEMYWOMANDARK01_1100_30	No slacking off!

A5_SRT_LHENEMY01_1100_30	Copy that!
A5_SRT_RENTORAR_5400_10	(There’s a Wooper that’s gone all limp.)
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_5400_10	Oh man! We gotta do something!
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_5400_20	But how can we get in there?
A5_SRT_RENTORAR_5400_20	(There’s a duct that looks like the ones\nat the police station.)
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_5400_30	That sounds promising!
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_6600_10	C’mon, Tim! Gimme a boost!
A5_SRT_TIM_6600_10	Sure thing. Hurry and go help!

A5_SRT_PIKACHU_6700_40	Phew... Out in one piece.
A5_SRT_LHENEMY01_1300_10	Hello, this is floor B1.
A5_SRT_TIM_1300_10	A Pokémon has escaped the facility!\nI need you on the first floor right away!
A5_SRT_TIM_1300_20	All of you!
A5_SRT_LHENEMY01_1300_20	B-but...we were told not\nto leave our posts...
A5_SRT_TIM_1300_30	Are you disobeying a direct\norder from your superior?!
A5_SRT_TIM_1300_40	Get yourselves up here NOW!
A5_SRT_LHENEMY01_1300_30	Y-yes, sir!
A5_SRT_LHENEMY01_1300_40	Emergency! Mobilize and move out!
A5_SRT_TIM_1300_50	We did it!
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_1300_10	They actually fell for it...
A5_SRT_UPAH_1500_10_NOMESSAGE	Woo...per! (Damp!)
A5_SRT_MARUMINE_1500_10_NOMESSAGE	Elecleclec... (Oof...)
A5_SRT_TIM_1500_10	Yes!
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_5600_10	Looks like a dead end...
A5_SRT_YONOIR_1800_10_NOMESSAGE	Noooiiir!
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_1800_10	Uh-oh!
A5_SRT_TIM_1800_10	Run!
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_1800_20	Yeah!
A5_SRT_YONOIR_1800_20_NOMESSAGE	Noooiiir!
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_4000_10	Phew... Sorry, Tim. I messed up.
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_4000_20	Maybe I should take up jogging\nstarting tomorrow...
A5_SRT_TIM_4000_20	That’s not exactly gonna help us right now.
A5_SRT_TIM_4000_30	Let’s try again!
A5_SRT_TIM_4100_10	Sorry, that was my fault...\nI messed up back there.
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_4100_20	Great Detective Tip #17!\nWe always learn from our mistakes.
A5_SRT_TIM_4100_20	Yeah, you’re right, Pikachu.
A5_SRT_YONOIR_5900_10_NOMESSAGE	Dusknoir. (There’s nobody here.)
A5_SRT_YONOIR_5900_20_NOMESSAGE	Dusk dusk? (Wait...huh?)
A5_SRT_DORYUZU_2300_10_NOMESSAGE	Driii!
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_2300_10	Whoa!
A5_SRT_DORYUZU_2300_20_NOMESSAGE	Driii! Driii!
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_2300_20	I think we’re better off\nnot opening this door...
A5_SRT_TIM_2300_10	Yeah... Hm?
A5_SRT_TIM_2300_20	Pikachu...
A5_SRT_LCENEMYWOMANDARK02_2300_10	Where in the world is that Cramorant?\nI swear it ran off this way...
A5_SRT_LHENEMYDARK01_2300_10	Why did it even swallow the\ncontroller in the first place?
A5_SRT_LHENEMYDARK01_2300_20	We can’t stop that Excadrill without it!
A5_SRT_LCENEMYWOMANDARK02_2300_20	It’d be more efficient if we\nsplit up and searched.
A5_SRT_LHENEMYDARK01_2300_30	Good idea. I’ll keep looking here\nwhile you check downstairs.
A5_SRT_LCENEMYWOMANDARK02_2300_30	OK. I’ll change the passcode\nto the stairs, just in case.
A5_SRT_LHENEMYDARK01_2300_40	It’s gonna be a pain in the neck\ncoming and going without card keys...
A5_SRT_LCENEMYWOMANDARK02_2300_40	Ah, stop complaining.\nCome on, Houndoom.

A5_SRT_UU_2400_10	(Hm?!)
A5_SRT_UU_2400_20	(Eeek! Run awaaay!)
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_2400_20	Hey, wait! Why are you flying away?
A5_SRT_LHENEMYDARK01_2400_10	I found the Cramorant!
A5_SRT_UU_2400_30_NOMESSAGE	PKMN cries - surprised
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_2400_30	Oh, that’s why. Unitas is after him.
A5_SRT_LHENEMYDARK01_2500_10	Wait—who are you?!
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_2500_10	Uh-oh!
A5_SRT_LHENEMYDARK01_2500_20	Hey! Stop!
A5_SRT_DORYUZU_2000_10_NOMESSAGE	Drrriiilll! (Rrraaagh!)
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_2000_5	Uagh!
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_2000_10	Hurry up, Tim!\nIt’s coming right at us!
A5_SRT_TIM_2000_10	I’m working on it!\nUmmm... Stop?!
A5_SRT_DORYUZU_2000_20_NOMESSAGE	Exca? (Huh?)
A5_SRT_RACHEL_4800_10	I didn’t want to believe it, but...
A5_SRT_RACHEL_4800_20	Papa, why are you part of this...?
A5_SRT_TIM_4800_10	Rachel...
A5_SRT_DORYUZU_6000_10_NOMESSAGE	Drill! (Here I go!)
A5_SRT_DORYUZU_6000_20_NOMESSAGE	Drrriiilll! (Hiyah!)
A5_SRT_DORYUZU_6000_30_NOMESSAGE	Drill! (How ’bout that?)
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_4900_10	Hm?!
A5_SRT_TIM_4900_10	You felt it again?
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_4900_20	Yeah. And it’s stronger than before.
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_4900_30	But...
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_4900_40	Pikachu’s consciousness feels\nlike it’s getting weaker.
A5_SRT_TIM_5200_10	Wait, isn’t this...
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_5300_10	OK, Klink! Do your thing!
A5_SRT_GIARU_5300_10_NOMESSAGE	Klilink. (Got it.)
A5_SRT_GIARU_5300_20_NOMESSAGE	Kli kli kliiii... (Here we go...)

A5_SRT_MURDOCH_2900_10	“Report Subject: Research Arrangements.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_2900_20	“I informed Howard that I would like to\nresume Emma’s final research project.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_2900_30	“It focused on coexistence with\nPokémon—the Unitas Project.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_2900_40	“I also pointed out that conducting such\nresearch would require a proper facility.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_2900_50	“Naturally, I suggested we name this new\nfacility the Unitas Lab.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_2900_60	“Heh... Howard was rather taken with\nthat name. He accepted my proposal\nimmediately.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_2900_70	“And with that, all obstacles to my\nresearch have been removed!”
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3000_10	“Report Subject: Cube Presentation.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3000_20	“I gave my presentation about\nthe cubes to Howard today.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3000_30	“He seemed concerned about the\nstrain they may put on Pokémon.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3000_40	“But in the end, he understood\nthat some side effects here and\nthere are simply unavoidable.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3000_50	“Now we can continue development\nwithout looking over our shoulders.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3000_60	“Once production is going smoothly,\nI plan to move on to the project I’ve\nkept on the back burner until now.”
A5_SRT_TIM_3100_10	Why’s there a picture of\nyou in there, Pikachu?
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_3100_10	I’m guessing it doesn’t belong to an\nadoring fan.
A5_SRT_TIM_3100_20	We’d better look into this.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3200_10	“Report Subject: Research Data.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3200_20	“Approximately six months\nprior to the R incident...
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3200_30	“I discovered a method of linking\nthe minds of humans and Pokémon.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3200_40	“This would make it possible to\ncontrol Pokémon as we please.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3200_50	“I’m certain this is the greatest\ndiscovery of the century.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3200_60	“But it was not possible at that stage of my\nresearch to make my hypothesis a reality.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3200_70	“More information was required.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3200_80	“Since then, I’ve searched relentlessly\nfor the missing piece of the puzzle...
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3200_90	“Until at last, I found it—in the research\nthat Emma had previously conducted.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3200_100	“She called my research dangerous, insisted\nthat I stop...but that was no concern of mine.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3200_110	“I took the first opportunity to scour\nthe research facility, but by that point,\nEmma’s data was nowhere to be found.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3200_120	“Jessica did this...

A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3300_20	“I had not expected Pikachu and his\nallies to show up in Bamboo Borough.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3300_30	“Nevertheless, we did manage to find\nJessica and retrieve the research data.
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3300_40	“Now that the last piece of the\npuzzle is in my possession, my\nresearch is finally complete!

A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3400_40	“This is definitive proof that\nmy hypothesis was correct!
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3400_50	“I wish I could have shown\nthis to Emma and Jessica!
A5_SRT_MURDOCH_3400_60	“The cubes are nothing more than toys\nnow! Heh heh heh... Hahahahaha!”
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_5000_10	Hey, got a moment?
A5_SRT_TIM_5000_10	What is it?
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_5000_20	I think we should organize\nour findings so far.
A5_SRT_TIM_5000_20	Yeah, let’s lay it out.
A5_SRT_LHENEMYDARK01_3500_10	Why is there a hole here...?

A5_SRT_PIKACHU_3500_10	Hey, sweet! They dropped their\ncard key!
A5_SRT_TIM_4200_5	Ah!
A5_SRT_LKENEMYDARK02_4200_10	Huh?

A5_SRT_LCENEMYWOMANDARK02_4200_10	H-hey, wait! Stop!
A5_SRT_RACHEL_5100_10	We’ve finally made it.
A5_SRT_TIM_5100_10	Yeah... And that means it’s possible\nMayor Myers is just ahead.
A5_SRT_RACHEL_5100_20	Hey, don’t worry about me.
A5_SRT_TIM_5100_20	Rachel...
A5_SRT_RACHEL_5100_30	Merloch may have fooled my\nfather, but we’re about to prove\nwhat a crook he really is!
A5_SRT_TIM_5100_30	That’s right.
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_5100_10	Hey, hey! What about my body?!
A5_SRT_TIM_5100_40	Oh, don’t you worry. We haven’t forgotten.
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_5100_20	Oh, well, OK then.

A5_SRT_PIKACHU_3800_10	Looks like the whole cast is here.
A5_SRT_TIM_3800_10	We need to prove Merloch’s deception\nand put a stop to his scheme.
A5_SRT_PIKACHU_3800_20	Yeah, but where do we even start...
A5_SRT_HOWARD_3800_30	Tim Goodman?\nWhat are you doing here?

A5_V5_HOWARD_100_10	Investigating Unitas?\nWhy are you doing that?
A5_V5_TIM_100_10	Unitas has been causing some\nserious problems, Mayor Myers.
A5_V5_HOWARD_100_20	Problems?! What are you talking about?
A5_V5_RACHEL_100_10	Papa! Please listen!
A5_V5_TIM_200_10	Mayor Myers, Unitas is a\ndangerous organization.
A5_V5_HOWARD_200_10	But all they do is conduct\nresearch into Pokémon.
A5_V5_HOWARD_200_20	I created Unitas for the\nbenefit of Ryme City.
A5_V5_HOWARD_200_30	How could that be dangerous?\nOn what basis do you make this claim?
A5_V5_TIM_300_10	Remember the jewel theft\nat the Denis residence?
A5_V5_HOWARD_300_10	Yes, I did hear that the Aurora Drop was\nstolen the day after the award ceremony.
A5_V5_TIM_300_20	That’s right—and Unitas was\ninvolved in that incident.
A5_V5_HOWARD_300_20	Excuse me?
A5_V5_TIM_300_30	And I also have evidence that the\nAurora Drop was brought here.
A5_V5_HOWARD_300_30	How could that be?
A5_V5_PIKACHU_400_10	Nah, Unitas didn’t do that!
A5_V5_PIKACHU_400_20	C’mon, think back!
A5_V5_HOWARD_500_10	I’m sure that was just a few bad apples.
A5_V5_HOWARD_500_20	You can’t say the whole organization\nis dangerous just because of that.
A5_V5_TIM_500_10	Actually, they’ve committed other crimes\nas well—and they even targeted us too.
A5_V5_TIM_600_10	Everywhere we went, we kept\ngetting attacked by Unitas.
A5_V5_HOWARD_600_10	I’m sure...that was just\na misunderstanding.
A5_V5_RACHEL_600_10	Misunderstanding?! They even\nwent after me and Jessica!
A5_V5_HOWARD_600_20	Rachel... You too?
A5_V5_HOWARD_600_30	Merloch! Did you know about this?!
A5_V5_PIKACHU_600_10	Yeesh... He’s completely ignoring us.
A5_V5_PIKACHU_700_10	Was that really Unitas’s doing?
A5_V5_PIKACHU_700_20	Think carefully, Tim.
A5_V5_RACHEL_800_10	Please, Papa! You have to stop this!
A5_V5_HOWARD_800_10	I can’t do that...
A5_V5_HOWARD_800_20	Not when human-Pokémon coexistence\nis so close to being achieved.
A5_V5_TIM_800_10	And the cubes are how\nyou’ll achieve that?
A5_V5_HOWARD_800_30	Exactly. Pokémon can be dangerous\nat times—but the Friendship Cubes will\nsolve that problem.
A5_V5_TIM_800_20	“Friendship” Cubes? Mayor Myers,\nthose cubes ARE the problem.
A5_V5_TIM_800_30	Do you have any idea how Pokémon have\nbeen harmed because of those cubes?
A5_V5_TIM_900_10	The PPB incident...
A5_V5_HOWARD_900_10	The case with Butler?\nI did hear about that...
A5_V5_TIM_900_20	He was using one of those cubes to\nmake a Pokémon commit crimes.
A5_V5_HOWARD_900_20	He what...? Why would he\nmisuse the cubes that way?
A5_V5_TIM_900_30	Because of that, my Pikachu\nwas wrongfully arrested...
A5_V5_TIM_900_40	I nearly lost a member of my family\nbecause of those cubes.
A5_V5_HOWARD_900_30	Hm—!
A5_V5_PIKACHU_1000_10	Hey, wait. Isn’t that a bit off?
A5_V5_PIKACHU_1000_20	Think about when the cubes\nwere used to do bad stuff.
A5_V5_HOWARD_1100_10	You’ve helped me understand how the\nFriendship Cubes could be dangerous...
A5_V5_HOWARD_1100_20	IF they’re misused, which is not enough\nof a reason to stop this operation.
A5_V5_RACHEL_1100_10	Papa!
A5_V5_HOWARD_1100_30	With the Friendship Cubes, humans\nand Pokémon can finally understand\none another!
A5_V5_TIM_1100_10	Mayor Myers.
A5_V5_TIM_1100_20	Can’t you see you’re being deceived?!
A5_V5_HOWARD_1100_40	Hm? What do you mean?
A5_V5_TIM_1200_10	The purpose of the cubes, in truth...
A5_V5_TIM_1200_20	is to deprive Pokémon of their free will\nand force them to do what humans want!
A5_V5_HOWARD_1200_10	I was told the Friendship Cubes were\nrevolutionary devices that would allow \nhumans and Pokémon to live in harmony...
A5_V5_TIM_1200_30	Mayor Myers, you’ve been\ndeceived this whole time by\nthe name, “Friendship Cube.”
A5_V5_TIM_1200_40	They’re actually called...Control Cubes!
A5_V5_TIM_1200_50	Please! You have to stop\nthis before it’s too late!
A5_V5_HOWARD_1200_20	No! Never!
A5_V5_HOWARD_1200_30	Even if it’s all true...\nThis was Emma’s dream...
A5_V5_PIKACHU_1300_10	Do the cubes really do that?
A5_V5_PIKACHU_1300_20	Remember what I was like\nback at the police station!
A5_V5_HOWARD_1400_10	I nearly...made a terrible mistake\nthat couldn’t have been undone...
A5_V5_PIKACHU_1400_10	As much as I’d like to, we\ncan’t wrap this up just yet.
A5_V5_TIM_1400_10	There’s one last problem to take care of.
A5_V5_HOWARD_1400_20	Yes... Who took advantage of my plan?\nWho could have done these things?
A5_V5_TIM_1400_20	There’s only one person it could’ve been...
A5_V5_PIKACHU_1400_20	It’s time to expose the one\npulling the strings, Tim.
A5_V5_TIM_1400_30	Yeah!
A5_V5_PIKACHU_1500_10	C’mon, that’s not it!
A5_V5_PIKACHU_1500_20	Only one person could give\norders on Howard’s behalf.
A5_V5_TIM_7200_10	It didn’t work... Nothing’s changing.
A5_V5_PIKACHU_7200_10	Maybe removing the excess energy\ndidn’t do anything because they’re\nalready fused together.
A5_V5_TIM_7200_20	Think, Tim...\nThere HAS to be another way!
A5_V5_PIKACHU_7300_10	Wait a minute...
A5_V5_PIKACHU_7300_20	Merloch wrote about the energy\nin that report of his we uncovered.
A5_V5_TIM_7300_10	That’s right!
A5_V5_TIM_7300_20	What exactly did Merloch\nuse that energy for again?
A5_V5_TIM_6200_10	That’s it!
A5_V5_TIM_6200_20	If Merloch used that energy\nto fuse himself with Deoxys...
A5_V5_TIM_6200_30	then maybe that’s the key\nto separating them!
A5_V5_TIM_7400_10	No, that’s not right.
A5_V5_TIM_7400_20	There must be another\nway to use the energy...
A5_V5_PIKACHU_6300_10	Whoa, whoa, whoa!\nWhat’re you going on about?
A5_V5_TIM_6300_10	Merloch and Deoxys are fused\ntogether because of that energy.
A5_V5_TIM_6300_20	According to the report, the balance\nof that energy is crucial.
A5_V5_PIKACHU_6300_20	Oh! So we just gotta\ndisrupt that balance!
A5_V5_TIM_6300_30	Yeah, but...how do we do that?
A5_V5_TIM_6400_10	If we can somehow expose\nDeoxys to these two energies...
A5_V5_PIKACHU_6400_10	That excess energy will\nthrow off the balance!
A5_V5_TIM_6400_20	But...how do we do that?
A5_V5_PIKACHU_6400_20	Once we figure that out,
A5_V5_PIKACHU_6400_30	we can get back at him for\nthrowing me into that pod!
A5_V5_PIKACHU_6500_10	No, that won’t work...
A5_V5_PIKACHU_6500_20	They’re fused together,\nlike me and Pikachu.
A5_V5_PIKACHU_6500_30	An outside force—something like that\noughta throw ’em off-balance.

A0_MONOLOGUE_TIM_010	It’s been two years since the R incident.
A0_MONOLOGUE_TIM_020	Since then, we’ve solved all kinds of cases.
A0_MONOLOGUE_TIM_030	The mayor even gave us an award for it.
A0_MONOLOGUE_TIM_040	I can still talk to Pikachu and understand him.
A0_MONOLOGUE_TIM_050	If the two of us keep solving cases together...
A0_MONOLOGUE_TIM_060	I’m sure we’ll find my dad someday.
A1_MONOLOGUE_TIM_010	The Cramorant that stole the Aurora Drop...
A1_MONOLOGUE_TIM_020	The swarm of Beedrill that attacked Mewtwo...
A1_MONOLOGUE_TIM_030	They both had glowing devices stuck to them.
A1_MONOLOGUE_TIM_040	After hearing Mewtwo say my dad’s name...
A1_MONOLOGUE_TIM_050	I think, if I investigate the Aurora Drop,
A1_MONOLOGUE_TIM_060	that I might get closer to finding him.
A3_MONOLOGUE_TIM_010	How can I get my father back?
A3_MONOLOGUE_TIM_020	There must be something I can do...
A3_MONOLOGUE_TIM_030	With all the unrest gripping the city,

A3_MONOLOGUE_TIM_050	Of course—I’ll just talk to Inspector Holiday.
A3_MONOLOGUE_TIM_060	He’s bound to know something useful.

A2_SUMMARY_050	Tim manages to visit Pikachu at the police station and begins\nhis deduction to prove Pikachu’s innocence.
A2_SUMMARY_060	After visiting Pikachu, Tim learns that Will Butler, chief of the\nPokémon Protection Bureau, is keeping a close eye on Inspector\nHoliday, making it difficult for Holiday to help Tim investigate.

A2_SUMMARY_140	From the evidence left at the crime scenes, Tim has deduced\nthat the Pokémon apprehended by the PPB are being detained\nfor crimes they didn’t commit.
A2_SUMMARY_150	Using police testimony, Tim has deduced that the Pokémon in\nthe incriminating photos of each incident are different from the\nPokémon that are actually being detained.
A2_SUMMARY_160	Tim visits Pikachu a second time. After discussing the information\nthey’ve gathered, they deduce that a Ditto must be responsible\nfor the crimes.
A2_SUMMARY_170	Tim dismisses Brad as a suspect and deduces that the true\nculprit is whoever it is that’s controlling Ditto. Meanwhile,\nPikachu heads for Chief Butler’s office.
A2_SUMMARY_180	Pikachu has made his way past the police officers on the first\nfloor and reached Chief Butler’s office. He is now searching for\nevidence that proves the detained Pokémon’s innocence.

A3_SUMMARY_040	Gordon’s footprints lead past a wall with a relief of Aegislash.\nTim and Pikachu deduce that some sort of mechanism has to\nbe triggered to reveal the path forward.
A3_SUMMARY_050	Tim and Pikachu have deduced that the statues and murals of\nPassimian are linked to the mechanism, and that they need to\nfind Berries to place on each of the three statues.
A3_SUMMARY_060	Tim and Pikachu come up with the idea to place curry on the\ncenter statue in place of a Berry, which triggers the mechanism.
A3_SUMMARY_070	As the group advanced further into the ruins, they were stopped\nby a deep hole in the ground. Pikachu then noticed a hat on the\nother side, which meant Gordon had somehow gotten across.

A3_SUMMARY_130	The path everyone came from closes, trapping them. Gordon\nsays that if they solve the mystery of the ruins, they may be able\nto find a way out.
A3_SUMMARY_140	Tim and Pikachu figure out what the murals mean, but can’t find\na way forward. Pikachu has a bolt of brilliance that leads them\nto believe the answer is hidden behind a wall of ice.

C5_Q0510_DESCRIPTION2	This lab is in rough shape. Perhaps Unitas tried to repair it using\nhard meteorites.
C5_Q0510_ANSWER3	To train subordinates.
C5_Q0510_DESCRIPTION3	Unitas may have been training their new members who weren’t\nready to be assigned to missions on how to use the cubes to control\nPokémon.
C5_Q0510_ANSWER4	To survey the ruins.
C5_Q0510_DESCRIPTION4	Unitas was compiling documentation about the ruins. They may\nhave been trying to conduct an archeological survey of the ruins.
C5_Q0610_TITLE	How can we get downstairs?
C5_Q0610_DETAIL	Neither a passcode nor a card key could be found on floor B3. Is there a\nway to get downstairs without using either of those security measures?
C5_Q0610_CONCLUSION	Ask Excadrill to drill a hole in the floor!
C5_Q0610_ANSWER1	Drill a hole in the damaged floor.
C5_Q0610_DESCRIPTION1	A section of the floor is already damaged. If we ask Excadrill for\nhelp, it may be able to drill through that weak spot to reach the\nlower floor.
C5_Q0610_ANSWER2	Smash through the damaged floor.
C5_Q0610_DESCRIPTION2	A section of the floor is already damaged. We may be able to get\ndownstairs if we ask Hariyama to smash through the floor.
C5_Q0610_ANSWER3	Ask Unitas for the passcode.
C5_Q0610_DESCRIPTION3	Someone in Unitas has to know the passcode. I bet we could\nget a Unitas member to give us the passcode so we can unlock\nthe door.
C5_Q0610_ANSWER4	Use the card key Cramorant probably swallowed.
C5_Q0610_DESCRIPTION4	Cramorant probably swallowed the card key—that’s why no one\nhas it. If we get Cramorant to spit it out, we can use it to get\ndownstairs.
C5_Q0710_TITLE	Why was Unitas capturing and detaining Pokémon?
C5_Q0710_DETAIL	Think about the reason why Unitas was capturing Pokémon.

C5_Q0710_ANSWER1	As test subjects for the cubes.
C5_Q0710_DESCRIPTION1	The list of Pokémon in Unitas’s experiment report matches the list\nof detained Pokémon. They might have been gathering Pokémon to\nuse them as test subjects for the cubes.
C5_Q0710_ANSWER2	To distribute the cubes.
C5_Q0710_DESCRIPTION2	Based on the fact that the cubes have been mass produced, Unitas\nmay intend to distribute cubes throughout the city by attaching\nthem to the Pokémon on the list.
C5_Q0710_ANSWER3	To fund their research.
C5_Q0710_DESCRIPTION3	Unitas might have been funding their research of the cubes by\nselling off the Pokémon they detained.

V4_Q1_TITLE	Pikachu says he borrowed the key...
V4_Q1_ANSWER1	But my dad actually borrowed the key
V4_Q1_DESCRIPTION1	Pikachu met my dad in the bamboo forest because\nmy dad borrowed the key to the gate, opened the\ngate, and entered the forest.
V4_Q1_ANSWER2	But the key wasn’t actually necessary
V4_Q1_DESCRIPTION2	If Pikachu was already in the forest when he met my\ndad, then the gate must’ve been left open, so the\nkey wouldn’t have been needed in the first place.
V4_Q1_ANSWER3	But he really took the key without asking for it
V4_Q1_DESCRIPTION3	Pikachu says he borrowed the key, but he couldn’t\nhave done that if he couldn’t speak to humans, so\nhe must’ve taken the key when no one was looking.
V4_Q1_ANSWER4	But he actually found the key on the ground and took it
V4_Q1_DESCRIPTION4	The charcoal maker’s apprentice is pretty careless.\nHe probably dropped the key, and I guess Pikachu\nmust’ve found it and took it.

V4_Q2_ANSWER1	So how could Pikachu have gone to look for medicine?
V4_Q2_DESCRIPTION1	Pikachu says he stayed by Pancham’s side—who\ncouldn’t move—AND that he went off to look for\nmedicine. He couldn’t have done both of these at\nthe same time.
V4_Q2_ANSWER2	So did Pikachu have the medicine from the start?
V4_Q2_DESCRIPTION2	Pikachu had the medicine even though he stayed by\nPancham’s side... Maybe he prepared the medicine\nin advance and already had it?
V4_Q2_ANSWER3	So did he bring Pancham with him to look for medicine?
V4_Q2_DESCRIPTION3	Pikachu stayed by Pancham’s side, yet he somehow\nalso got medicine for Pancham. Maybe he took\nPancham with him to look for medicine?
V4_Q2_ANSWER4	But how could Pikachu have protected Pancham?
V4_Q2_DESCRIPTION4	Pikachu was protecting Pancham, but Pikachu\ncouldn’t have protected Pancham because he can’t\nuse any of his moves.
V4_Q3_TITLE	Pikachu says he climbed a boulder to follow my dad...
V4_Q3_ANSWER1	So did he climb the same boulder twice?
V4_Q3_DESCRIPTION1	Pikachu says he climbed a boulder and continued\non, then he followed my dad and climbed a boulder\nagain. It sounds like he climbed the same boulder\ntwice, but that clearly doesn’t make any sense.
V4_Q3_ANSWER2	So were there two boulders?
V4_Q3_DESCRIPTION2	Pikachu says he climbed a boulder and continued\non, then he followed my dad and climbed a boulder\nagain. That would’ve been odd for him to do since\nthere shouldn’t have been two boulders to climb.
V4_Q3_ANSWER3	But were any boulders actually there in the first place?
V4_Q3_DESCRIPTION3	When we investigated the bamboo forest, we didn’t\nsee any boulders that could be climbed. Pikachu\nmight be mistaking “boulders” for something else.
V4_Q3_ANSWER4	But is Pikachu even capable of climbing a boulder?
V4_Q3_DESCRIPTION4	Pikachu is pretty out of shape these days. It’s likely\nthat he wouldn’t have been able to climb boulders\nback then, either.
V4_Q4_TITLE	Pikachu says he spoke to that suspicious duo...
V4_Q4_ANSWER1	So was Pikachu able to communicate with them?
V4_Q4_DESCRIPTION1	Those two men played dumb when Pikachu spoke\nto them... But Pikachu’s voice should have sounded\nlike a cry, so it’s strange that they even responded\nto what he said.
V4_Q4_ANSWER2	So did Pikachu speak to them before my dad did?
V4_Q4_DESCRIPTION2	It’s odd that Pikachu spoke to that suspicious duo\nfirst. My dad should’ve been the first one to talk to\nthem.
V4_Q4_ANSWER3	So he didn’t have a bolt of brilliance?
V4_Q4_DESCRIPTION3	At times when Pikachu is about to take decisive\naction, he says “A bolt of brilliance!” It’s odd, then,\nthat Pikachu didn’t say his catchphrase.
V4_Q4_ANSWER4	So did Pikachu know those two?
V4_Q4_DESCRIPTION4	It wouldn’t have been odd for Pikachu to speak to\nthose two men if they already knew each other.
V4_Q5_TITLE	Pikachu says he gave the hat...
V4_Q5_ANSWER1	But my dad’s the one who gave Pikachu his hat
V4_Q5_DESCRIPTION1	Pikachu got the hat he wears from my dad. It’s odd\nfor Pikachu to say he gave that hat to himself.
V4_Q5_ANSWER2	So there were two Pikachu
V4_Q5_DESCRIPTION2	If there were two Pikachu, Pikachu could’ve given\nthe hat to the other one. But he’s never mentioned\nanything like that.
V4_Q5_ANSWER3	So there was another hat
V4_Q5_DESCRIPTION3	Pikachu could’ve had a second hat to give besides\nthe one he always wears...but he’s never mentioned\nanything like that, so there was probably just the\none hat.
V4_Q5_ANSWER4	So he gave the hat to himself as a present
V4_Q5_DESCRIPTION4	Even if Pikachu gave the hat to himself, he couldn’t\nhave gotten it by himself in the first place.
