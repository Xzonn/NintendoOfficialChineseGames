mn_OP_mw_opening08	Using this pipe, we can set off on an adventure!\r\nLet's decide who will be the Super Star!
mn_OP_mw_opening09	I think we'll be able to go to places you remember...\r\nPlaces we haven't been in a long time!
mn_OP_mw_opening10	There's no time to waste. Let's get going...\r\nto the world of Mario Party, old and new!

bd01_OP_mw_past00	This enormous cake was made for the\r\nbirthday of a very special princess.
bd01_OP_mw_past01	Even the candles are huge. Lighting\r\nthem all was quite the task!
bd01_OP_mw_purpose00	But what are we celebrating today, you\r\nask? A natural question!
bd01_OP_mw_purpose01	Isn't it obvious? A new Super Star\r\nis going to be born! Today, in fact!
bd01_OP_mw_purpose02	Do you understand what that means?\r\nWe want you to become Super Stars!
bd01_OP_mw_purpose03	Looks like you're all fired up! Good. Off\r\nyou march!
bd01_p01_mw_explaination00	The board looks mighty tasty... But what's up\r\nwith those pairs of green-colored spaces?
bd01_p01_mw_explaination01	{color[ffffffff]}This route takes you past the pudding,\r\nbut watch for {color[ff3502ff]}Bowser{color[ffffffff]} and {color[ff3502ff]}Red Spaces{color[ffffffff]}!{color[000000ff]}
bd01_p01_mw_explaination02	{color[ffffffff]}Look closely, and you might catch a\r\nglimpse of a {color[ff3502ff]}Goomba{color[ffffffff]} near the pudding...{color[000000ff]}
bd01_p01_mw_explaination03	{color[110c1dff]}That {color[ff3502ff]}Goomba{color[110c1dff]} decides which path you'll\r\ntake, so drop by and say hello!{color[000000ff]}
bd01_s04_mw_kuppaCake01	So you like cake, do you? Well, THIS\r\nshould make you happy!
bd01_s04_mw_kuppaCake02	I got up at the crack of dawn to make\r\nthis. It's going to rock your taste buds!
bd01_s04_mw_kuppaCake03	Oh...the price? Well, all that hard work...\r\nWhat do you say to 20  coins?
bd01_s04_mw_kuppaCake06	Now that that's settled... Don't sit there\r\nlike a stone! Eat up!
bd01_s04_mw_kuppaCake04	Did I mention...it's made of rocks?\r\nBetter watch those teeth! BWAHAHA!
bd01_s04_mw_kuppaCake05	What do you mean you don't have the\r\n coins? Fine. Gimme what you've got!
bd01_s04_mw_curseDice01	Ooh, I've got something good for you.\r\nI hope you saved up... BWAHAHA!
bd01_s04_mw_curseDice02	It's an artifact that's been passed down\r\ngeneration after generation...
bd01_s04_mw_curseDice03	I'll let it go for just [0]  coins. At that\r\nprice, YOU'RE practically robbing ME!
bd01_s04_mw_curseDice04	OK. I fibbed. It's just a regular old {color[ff3502ff]}Cursed\r\nDice Block{color[000000ff]}{color[ffffffff]}. Enjoy it! BWAHAHA!{color[000000ff]}
bd01_s04_mw_curseDice05	What do you mean you don't have the\r\n coins? Fine. Gimme what you've got!
bd01_s04_mw_curseDice06	I know, I know... It's just 3  coins in the\r\nshop. So what? BWAHAHA!
bd01_s04_mw_getCoin00	Wait a minute...are you in last place? Oof, \r\nthat's rough. I feel sorry for you. Almost.
bd01_s04_mw_getCoin01	I'm feeling generous today. Take a few\r\n coins. I'm just a big softy, I know!

bd01_gmk01_mw_replant01	Look at that strawberry grow!
bd01_gmk01_mw_replant02	No, thanks? It's your choice, I guess!
bd01_gmk01_mw_replant03	That strawberry will grab a  Star\r\ninstead of  coins. Can't wait to see that!
bd01_gmk01_mw_robCoin00	{color[ffffffff]}Looks like this {color[ff3502ff]}Piranha Plant{color[ffffffff]} can\r\nsteal {color[ffffffff]}{color[ffffffff]} coins one more time!{color[000000ff]}
bd01_gmk01_mw_noCoin01	Since you don't have any  coins to steal,\r\nthe {color[ff3502ff]}Piranha Plant{color[000000ff]}{color[ffffffff]} ignores you.{color[000000ff]}

bd04_p01_mw_explaination01	This is {color[ff3502ff]}Watermelon Island{color[000000ff]}{color[ffffffff]}. Look over\r\nthere! {color[ff3502ff]}Bowser{color[ffffffff]}'s catching some rays!{color[000000ff]}
bd04_p01_mw_explaination02	Two bridges connect the islands. Pay\r\nthe {color[ff3502ff]}Thwomp{color[000000ff]}{color[ffffffff]}'s fee, and you can cross.{color[000000ff]}
bd04_p01_mw_explaination03	There are {color[ff3502ff]}Yoshis{color[000000ff]} {color[110c1dff]}everywhere. They seem\r\nto be keeping an eye on us!{color[000000ff]}
bd04_p02_mw_lastSpNPC007_00	Let's take a listen to the wisdom of\r\nthe waves, as delivered by {color[ff3502ff]}Cheep Cheep{color[000000ff]}{color[110c1dff]}!{color[000000ff]}
bd04_p02_mw_lastSpNPC007_01	To be honest, all that splashing is making\r\nit hard to hear. Was that...{color[ff3502ff]}[0]{color[000000ff]}{color[110c1dff]}?{color[000000ff]}
bd04_p02_mw_lastSpNPC035_00	This time, let's hear from this spiky\r\ncharacter!
bd04_p02_mw_lastSpNPC035_01	Blub-blub... Blub-blub-blub...
bd04_p02_mw_lastSpNPC035_02	Hmm. "Circumstances being what they\r\nare, victory for {color[ff3502ff]}[0] {color[000000ff]}{color[110c1dff]}is assured."{color[000000ff]}
bd01_s04_mw_koopaFloat00	Bwahaha! Floating free in the ocean is\r\nso relaxing... You should give it a try!

bd01_s04_mw_koopaFloat04	Well, if you can't afford it, I'll just take\r\nall the  coins you've got! Bwahaha!

bd04_gmk02_mw_dossun00	The {color[ff3502ff]}Thwomp{color[000000ff]}{color[ffffffff]}'s toll has been halved.{color[000000ff]}
bd04_gmk02_mw_dossun01	Seems like you'll have to hand over\r\n[0]  coin if you want to pass.
bd04_gmk02_mw_dossun01p	Seems like you'll have to hand over\r\n[0]  coins if you want to pass.

bd04_gmk02_mw_dossun01_a1	Don't Pay
bd04_gmk02_mw_firstDossun00	It looks like the  coin toll is going to\r\nincrease with each player who passes.

bd04_gmk02_mw_dossun02	Seems like you'll have to hand over\r\n[0]  coins if you want to pass.
bd04_gmk02_mw_dossun03	I think the {color[ff3502ff]}Thwomp{color[000000ff]}{color[ffffffff]} feels a little let down.{color[000000ff]}

bd05_OP_mw_past00	A sinister magician once made a\r\nhome of these spooky woods...
bd05_OP_mw_past01	But when the Super Star drove them\r\naway, the forest returned to normal.
bd05_OP_mw_purpose00	Since then, some spooky spirits arrived\r\nand made everything, well, spooky again.
bd05_OP_mw_purpose01	If only a new Super Star would rise and\r\nsave the forest from its frightening fate...
bd05_OP_mw_purpose02	Now... Where oh where might we find a\r\nnew Super Star?
bd05_OP_mw_purpose03	Do I have to spell it out for you? Become\r\nthe Super Star and save our forest!

bd05_p01_mw_explaination02	There are also stones with strange marks\r\non them. They probably hide a secret...

bd05_gmk03_mw_night00	You knock, but the sound is drowned out\r\nby wicked laughter emanating from within.
bd05_gmk03_mw_noCoin00	You don't have many  coins, huh?\r\nLooks like we have nothing to discuss.

bd05_gmk03_mw_ask00	Well then, what are we waiting for?\r\nLet there be night!
bd05_gmk03_mw_ask01	And just like that, darkness has fallen.
bd05_gmk03_mw_noAsk00	Really? Well, suit yourself.\r\nCome back when you change your mind.
bd05_gmk04_mw_daytime00	This seems like a great place for a party.
bd05_gmk04_mw_noCoin00	You wanna join our party? Do you have\r\n[0]  coins? Didn't think so! Scram!
bd05_gmk04_mw_night00	Cough up [0]  {color[ffffffff]}coins, and we'll consider\r\nletting you in on the fun. Sound good?{color[000000ff]}

bd05_gmk05_mw_eye00	Looking at you intently, the giant\r\neyeball seems to be saying, "Will you\r\ngive me  coins to warp you?"
bd05_gmk05_mw_eye01	The eye stares at you. You hear\r\nnothing, but it is seemingly saying,\r\n"So, you want to warp after all. I see."

bd05_gmk05_mw_ask00	The orb gazes deep within you as though\r\nit is saying, "All set? Then let's roll!"
bd05_gmk05_mw_noAsk00	The glassy sphere peers right through\r\nyou as if to say, "Well, that's too bad."
bd05_gmk06_mw_night00	Magic is binding this {color[ff3502ff]}Whomp{color[000000ff]} {color[ffffffff]}in its place,\r\nmaking it unable to move at night.{color[000000ff]}

bd05_gmk06_mw_wal00	It seems like the {color[ff3502ff]}Whomp{color[000000ff]}{color[ffffffff]} is asking if\r\nyou'd like it to move so you can pass.{color[000000ff]}
bd05_gmk06_mw_wal00_a0	Pay {color[110c1dff]}5 {color[ffffffff]}{color[110c1dff]} to Pass{color[000000ff]}

bd05_gmk07_mw_giveStar01	Hmm... Looks like I can't steal a  Star\r\nfrom every player. That's really too bad!

sys_pause_bd01_text02	There's always one winning seed in\r\nGoomba's lottery. If three seeds are\r\nchosen with no wins, the fourth is it.
sys_pause_bd01_text03	If you land where you planted a\r\nstrawberry, you'll get  coins, and\r\nit won't disappear either!
sys_pause_bd01_text04	Small strawberries are hardy little\r\nplants. There's a chance they won't\r\ndisappear after stealing  coins.
sys_pause_bd01_text05	There's a chocolaty crown atop the\r\ncake. Perhaps the Super Star will\r\nearn that regal decoration!
sys_pause_bd01_text06	You'll find Bowser perched on the\r\npudding. How does he maintain\r\nhis royal dignity and not dig in?
sys_pause_bd02_text00	Do whatever it takes to stay out of the\r\nBowser Coin Beam's line of fire!

sys_pause_bd02_text05	Somewhere on the board, a UFO has\r\ncrash-landed. Where are the aliens?
sys_pause_bd02_text06	The Bowser Coin Beam is powered by\r\nsolar panels. Or so Bowser says...
sys_pause_bd03_text00	This board wends its way through the depths\r\nof the forest. They say that many who wander\r\nhere become lost. Proceed with caution.
sys_pause_bd03_text01	The signposts seem to always change\r\ndirection. If you're not careful, you might \r\nend up traveling along the wrong route.
sys_pause_bd03_text02	The large trees have fruit you can take.\r\nPicking fruit has its consequences though,\r\nso try to choose a ripe one!
sys_pause_bd03_text03	As you travel deeper into the woods, be on\r\nyour guard. There's an ominous tree there.
sys_pause_bd03_text04	This forest is lush and green with plenty\r\nof critters. Even the animals of the forest\r\nget lost sometimes though.
sys_pause_bd03_text05	Monty Mole will change the direction of the\r\nsignposts in exchange for  coins. The price\r\nchanges on a whim!
sys_pause_bd03_text06	The large trees will drop two different types of\r\nfruits at the same time. You can only choose\r\none, so be careful about which fruit you pick!
sys_pause_bd04_text00	You'll need to travel between islands to\r\nget your  Star. Pay attention, because\r\nthe route may be a bit complicated.
sys_pause_bd04_text01	You can raise the Thwomp's toll by as\r\nmuch as you'd like, but it can't be lowered.\r\nBe careful not to raise the toll too high!
sys_pause_bd04_text02	Cheep Chomp's Trick will move the  Star\r\nfrom one island to the other. Be sure to\r\ngrab the  Star before it moves away!
sys_pause_bd04_text03	If you look closely, both islands are\r\nshaped like Yoshis! The one with the\r\nwatermelons is Watermelon Island.
sys_pause_bd04_text04	If you look closely, both islands are\r\nshaped like Yoshis! The one with the\r\ncantaloupes is Cantaloupe Island.
sys_pause_bd04_text05	There's a shipwreck just off the board.\r\nNo one knows when or why the ship sank,\r\nbut legend says it was transporting fruit!
sys_pause_bd04_text06	Watermelons, cantaloupes, apples, bananas...\r\nThere's so much fruit on this board!\r\nMaybe the Super Star gets to eat it all?
sys_pause_bd05_text00	Ghosts gather around these parts at night!\r\nIf you want to see them, spend the day\r\nmoving to an area where they might appear.
sys_pause_bd05_text01	Sleeping Whomps won't move at night.\r\nIf you don't pass them during the day,\r\nyou might be stuck when night falls.
sys_pause_bd05_text02	Mr. I's warp costs less at night than it does\r\nduring the day, so try to make your way over\r\nthere when it's dark out!
sys_pause_bd05_text03	Ghosts mostly come out at night, but there's\r\none spot where Boo appears during the day.\r\nCan you figure out where?
sys_pause_bd05_text04	What's that racket coming from the Mystery\r\nMansion every night? Sounds like a party...
sys_pause_bd05_text05	There's a swing that sits motionless during\r\nthe day, but it starts moving at night. The only\r\nthing is...there's no one on it! Very spooky!
sys_pause_bd05_text06	If you're standing in Mr. I's warp path,\r\nyou might be able to catch a free ride!
