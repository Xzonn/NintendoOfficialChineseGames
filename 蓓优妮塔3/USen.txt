C01_EV1000_00010_ENZO	Ed... ! Edna... ! Ah God!
C01_EV1000_00020_RODN	He tried to go outside,\nbut I knocked some sense into him.
C01_EV1000_00030_RODN	After all,\nhe still hasn't paid that tab.
C01_EV1000_00040_RODN	We'll be cool down here for a little while...
C01_EV1000_00050_RODN	...a very little while.
C01_EV1000_00060_BAYO	You mean those weren't your playmates?
C01_EV1000_00070_RODN	Not my type.\nAlthough I did try shakin' hands.
C01_EV1000_00080_RODN	Those things ain't from Paradiso or Inferno.\nThey're locals.
C01_EV1000_00090_RODN	In other words... they're part human.
C01_EV1000_00100_JANN	Human?
C01_EV1000_00110_GIRL	They're Homunculi.
C01_EV1000_00115_GIRL	Manmade bioweapons.
C01_EV1000_00120_RODN	How about you tell us who you are first?\nMiss...
C01_EV1000_00130_GIRL	Viola.
C01_EV1000_00135_GIRL	Bayonetta, I'm...
C01_EV1000_00140_GIRL	Uh, never mind.\nLook, we don't have time!
C01_EV1000_00150_GIRL	If we don't stop them, this world is\nhistory, and reality as we know it\ngets wiped out for good!
C01_EV1000_00160_BAYO	And so you just led them right to us?
C01_EV1000_00170_GIRL	No!
C01_EV1000_00180_GIRL	They're like locusts,\nspreading through the Multiverse...
C01_EV1000_00190_GIRL	...destroying it as they go!
C01_EV1000_00200_GIRL	Just trust me, damn it!\nWe've got to hurry.
C01_EV1000_00210_GIRL	Bayonetta... Jeanne...\nYou both have to help!
C01_EV1000_00220_JANN	Why do you know our names?\nAnd who the hell taught you\nthat bit of magic?
C01_EV1000_00230_GIRL	Well...
C01_EV1000_00240_GIRL	In the world I'm from, we've already met.
C01_EV1000_00250_GIRL	A world like this one,\nin another part of the Multiverse...
C01_EV1000_00260_GIRL	...but it's gone now.
C01_EV1000_00270_GIRL	Along with you, and you...\nand everything else!
C01_EV1000_00280_GIRL	The Homunculi are tearing through\nthe Multiverse and there's only a\nfew worlds left!
C01_EV1000_00290_JANN	Multiverse?
C01_EV1000_00300_JANN	On the off chance you're not insane,\nwhat do they want?
C01_EV1000_00310_RODN	Hold up. This could be serious.
C01_EV1000_00320_RODN	If what you're sayin' is true,\nthen this ain't just a human problem.
C01_EV1000_00330_RODN	Within the Trinity of Realities, the World\nof Chaos is actually made up of countless\nuniverses, all stacked up together.
C01_EV1000_00340_RODN	That's the Multiverse.
C01_EV1000_00350_RODN	If someone's wipin' those universes out\none by one... \nNah, "wipin' out" doesn't quite explain it.
C01_EV1000_00360_RODN	They're breakin' the Multiverse down,\ntryin' to fuse it together.
C01_EV1000_00370_RODN	Like runnin' thinly sliced wagyu beef\nthrough a grinder to make a big ol'\njuicy burger.
C01_EV1000_00380_RODN	And if they can pull it off, they'll get\ntheir hands on enough power to wipe\nout the whole Trinity in a snap.
C01_EV1000_00390_BAYO	Thank you, professor.
C01_EV1000_00400_BAYO	And what do you expect us to do?
C01_EV1000_00410_GIRL	Right. There are two things we have to do.
C01_EV1000_00420_GIRL	Jeanne, I want you to find a scientist\nnamed Sigurd. He's somewhere in this\nworld, and he can help us.
C01_EV1000_00430_GIRL	And Bayonetta, I want you to come with me\nto help find more of these.
C01_EV1000_00440_GIRL	This is a Chaos Gear,\nthe key to beating Singularity.
C01_EV1000_00450_GIRL	And the only one who knows how to\nuse them is Dr. Sigurd.
C01_EV1000_00460_GIRL	Without both of them,\nwe can kiss this world goodbye.
C01_EV1000_00470_BAYO	Well, since solitaire in a literal\nman cave isn't exactly riveting—
C01_EV1000_00480_BAYO	I suppose I'll be your chaperone.\nThat will help restore some sanity,\nright?
C01_EV1000_00490_BAYO	We'll have a bit of girl talk\nalong the way.
C01_EV1000_00500_GIRL	O-okay...
C01_EV1000_00510_RODN	So anyway Viola...
C01_EV1000_00515_RODN	You gonna introduce me to this thing\nor what?
C01_EV1000_00530_GIRL	Huh? Oh, damn it Cheshire!\nYou know you're not supposed\nto pop out like that!
C01_EV1000_00580_BAYO	Cheshire...
C01_EV1010_00010_GIRL	Their leader's name is Singularity.
C01_EV1010_00020_GIRL	He unravelled the secret of the\nMultiverse before anyone else.
C01_EV1010_00030_GIRL	Declaring his own world the Alphaverse,\nhe began destroying the other layers\nof the Multiverse one by one.
C01_EV1010_00040_GIRL	There's only one way to stop him—\ntake the fight to him in the Alphaverse.
C01_EV1010_00050_GIRL	We don't have a way to move freely\nthrough the Multiverse...
C01_EV1010_00060_GIRL	...but there's one place\nthat connects the whole thing.
C01_EV1010_00070_GIRL	A legendary island created by\nthe Umbra and the Lumen to study\nand reach out to the unknown—
C01_EV1010_00080_GIRL	The secluded island of Thule!
C01_EV1010_00090_BAYO	Are you sure your fantasy island\nis real?
C01_EV1010_00100_BOS1	Believe, and the path will open...
C01_EV1010_00110_BAYO	Believe, and the path will open...?
C01_EV1010_00160_GIRL	Look, there it is!
C01_EV1010_00170_BAYO	Hmm...\nSomeone seems very interested \nin our arrival.
C01_EV1010_00180_GIRL	Is it... him?
C01_EV1010_00190_GIRL	Let's land fast.\nIt's not safe.
C01_EV1010_00200_BAYO	What's that?
C01_EVa100_00010_ANNO	The doors are about to close.
C01_EVa101_00010_ANNO	We will be changing to another track.\nIf you are standing, please hold on to\na handstrap or a rail.
C01_EVa120_00010_BAYO	Could that be a Chaos Gear?
C01_EVa120_00020_BAYO	Greedy little thing.\nPerhaps it's time for a crash diet.
C01_EVa121_00010_SDF1	HQ, target sighted at 50 meters. 
C01_EVa121_00020_SDF1	Target is continuing northeast. Over.
C01_EVa121_00030_SDF1	This is HQ, roger that.
C01_EVa121_00040_SDF1	Engage when ready. Over.
C01_EVa121_00050_SDF1	Roger.
C01_EVa121_00060_SDF1	Ready... aim...
C01_EVa121_00070_SDF1	FIRE!
C01_EVa121_00080_SDF1	Anti-tank rockets up!
C01_EVa121_00090_SDF1	FIRE!
C01_EVa121_00100_SDF1	HQ... Target is intact.\nOur weapons have no visible effect.
C01_EVa121_00110_SDF1	I repeat, our weapons have no effect!
C01_EVa121_00120_SDF2	Huh?
C01_EVa121_00140_BAYO	Does anyone mind if I cut in?\nWouldn't want to step on anyone's toes.
C01_EVa121_00150_BAYO	Don't worry, I know this song by heart.
C01_EV1040_00010_RODN	Getting me confused for them?\nMust be off your game.
C01_EV1040_00020_BAYO	Never been more on.
C01_EV1040_00024_RODN	Well all right.
C01_EV1040_00028_RODN	Thing is, with all this mess going on,\nhalos are hard to come by...
C01_EV1040_00030_RODN	...but chaotic economics\nhas its own unique charms.
C01_EV1040_00040_BAYO	And you'd like me to help you\ndiversify.
C01_EV1040_00050_RODN	Heh... sharp as ever, Bayonetta.
C01_EV1040_00060_RODN	Welcome to The Gates of Hell.
C01_EV1040_00070_RODN	You can expect a fair rate\nfor these now too.
C01_EV1040_00080_RODN	Of course, I'll gladly accept\nany halos you bring in.\nMight even have something special for you.
C01_EV1045_00010_RODN	Hold up.\nAlmost forgot to give you this.
C01_EV1045_00020_RODN	Saw that Demon Slave and figured\nyou could handle it.\nTake special care of my baby.
C01_EV1045_00040_BAYO	Very nice.
C01_EVa122_00050_BAYO	Looks like they don't care much\nfor your techniques.
C01_EVa122_00060_BAYO	Why don't I try a more attentive approach?
CHAPTER/chapter01_ta
C01_TA0001_00010_BAYO	Quite the warm welcome. \nSo who'll be carrying my luggage?
C01_TA0002_00010_BAYO	That sword isn't just for play, is it kitty?
C01_TA0002_00020_GIRL	The fuck? Don't call me "kitty!"\nTrust me, I can take care of myself!
C01_TA0003_00010_GIRL	What's this?
C01_TA0003_00020_BAYO	It opens with Umbran magic.\nIt seems we really do share a past\nwith this island.
C01_TA0004_00010_BAYO	You're seeing that off\nin the distance too, right?
C01_TA0004_00020_GIRL	Yeah, pretty sure those are\nother worlds in the Multiverse.
C01_TA0004_00030_GIRL	I bet the people who built this place\nused to watch over different worlds\nthe same way...
C01_TA0012_00010_BAYO	Incredible...\nIt feels like being bathed in moonlight.
C01_TA0014_00010_BAYO	A fountain of magic energy...\nI'm starting to like it here.
C01_TA0015_00010_BAYO	You must have been dying\nfor some action too!
C01_TA0020_00010_GIRL	A dead end?\nWhat's this weird-ass wall?
C01_TA0020_00010_BAYO	Just needs the right touch.\nAny true Umbra Witch knows that.
C01_TA0021_00010_BAYO	This trip has been full of surprises, hasn't it!
C01_TA0021_00020_GIRL	Is this...\na Multiverse portal generator?
C01_TA0021_00030_GIRL	Bayonetta, wait.\nIt might be a bad idea to mess with that.
C01_TA0023_00010_BAYO	Too late for regrets now, I'm afraid.
C01_TA0023_00020_GIRL	Bayonetta!
C01_TA0023_00030_BAYO	Separate vacations for now, then.\nGood luck!

C01_TA0040_00010_BAYO	The ground here looks a bit weak.
C01_TA0041_00010_SDF3	Hey, is anyone out there?
C01_TA0041_00020_SDF3	If you're there, say something!
C01_TA0041_00030_SDF3	Man, if someone could just blow a hole\nin here, I could get these guys out...
C01_TA0042_00010_SDF3	You saved us.\nBut uh... just who are you?\n
C01_TA0050_00010_SDF4	This is HQ.\nWe've got reports of a unit engaged\nwith hostiles in the sewers.
C01_TA0050_00020_SDF4	Nearby units, move in\nand assist immediately.
C01_TA0050_00030_SDF4	Repeat—
C01_TA0050_00040_SDF4	There is a unit engaged\nwith hostiles in the sewers.
C01_TA0050_00050_SDF4	Comms with the unit are down.\nNearby units, move in and assist\nimmediately.
C01_TA0060_00010_SDF5	HQ, HQ. Come in. This is Namigumo.
C01_TA0060_00020_SDF5	We're pinned down in the sewers\nwith several wounded.
C01_TA0060_00030_SDF5	We need some help down here ASAP!
C01_TA0070_00010_SDF6	HQ, this is Murakumo, out in Yoyogi.\nGot eyes on two unknowns in pursuit\nof the target.
C01_TA0070_00020_SDF6	Unknowns don't appear to be civilians.\nAlso got reports of a large creature.
C01_TA0070_00030_SDF6	Could be an additional target.\nBe warned. Over.
C01_TA0070_00030_SDF7	HQ, we've got a giant airborne object\nover Shinjuku, headed northeast.
C01_TA0070_00050_SDF7	Wait... what the hell?\nThe ward office just disappeared!

CHAPTER/chapter02_ev
C02_EV1050_00010_BET1	Jeanne...
C02_EV1050_00020_BET1	Jeanne... Jeanne...
C02_EV1050_00030_BET1	Jeanne!
C02_EV1055_00010_BAYO	What was that...
C02_EV1055_00020_PHAN	What's this tiny thing?
C02_EV1055_00030_PHAN	I thought I smelled some decent prey,\nbut it's just an ugly witch!
C02_EV1055_00040_BAYO	Ugly, you say.
C02_EV1055_00050_BAYO	With all those eyes, I'd think\nyou'd be a bit more perceptive.
C02_EV1055_00060_PHAN	Keep buzzing, woman!\nMaybe I'll just stomp you right now!
C02_EV1055_00070_PHAN	Hmph... You're a tough one, aren't you!\nReminds me of the master.
C02_EV1055_00080_PHAN	...All right.\nIt seems like the strands of fate bind us.\nI'll stick with you for a while.
C02_EVa145_00010_PHAN	The master calls...\nFarewell, witch.
C02_EVa145_00020_BAYO	Well, I enjoyed the ride while it lasted.\nLet's do it again.
C02_EV1060_00010_BAYO	At last, someone with no strings attached.
C02_EV1060_00020_BAYO	And what's your name, my furry friend?
C02_EV1060_00030_BAYO	You know, I rather enjoy teaching obedience.
C02_EV1060_00040_BAYO	I'll have you rolling over in no time, Spot.
C02_EV1070_00010_BAYO	Seems like you're ready for the leash.
C02_EV1070_00020_BAYO	Now why don't you sit for mummy.
C02_EV1070_00030_BAYO	Perhaps I shouldn't have\nrubbed his nose in it.
CHAPTER/chapter02_ta
C02_TA0090_00010_BAYO	I can take the heat, but that's a bit much.
C02_TA0100_00010_BAYO	That water tank looks useful.\nDon't think I'll be getting close, though.
C02_TA0015_00010_NARR	...Damn....\nYAH!...Whoa!
C02_TA0015_00020_BAYO	That voice...?!
C02_TA0015_00030_NARR	
C02_TA0015_00040_NARR	Oof... Thanks, Cheshire.
C02_TA0015_00050_NARR	Hey, what's that?\nCome on, Cheshire!
C02_TA0015_00060_BAYO	Someone's having fun.\nAt least kitty's landed on her feet.
C02_TA0140_00010_BAYO	It's time to tie you down tight and teach\nyou how to behave... with a bit of help.
C02_TA0050_00010_BAYO	Not quite a convertible,\nbut I could get used to this.
C02_TA0060_00010_BAYO	Impressive artistry from a\nkilling machine.
C02_TA0093_00010_BAYO	Not an angel or a demon,\nbut not quite human either...\nWho are you?
CHAPTER/chapter03_ev
C03_EV1080_00010_LUKA	Do you believe in fate?
C03_EV1080_00020_BAYO	Luka?!
C03_EV1080_00030_LUKA	Fate brought us here together,\nand it will never tear us apart.
C03_EV1080_00040_LUKA	Man, these guys have been a huge\npain in the ass.
C03_EV1080_00050_LUKA	Hey, how about you take care of them\nfor me?
C03_EV1080_00060_LUKA	'Preciate it, Cerezita!
C03_EV1080_00070_BAYO	Wait!
C03_EV1080_00080_BAYO	I see his motto is still\n"Act first, think later."
C03_EV1100_00010_BAYO	Is that... ?
C03_EV1100_00020_BET1	I literally have bigger fish to fry...
C03_EV1100_00030_BET1	No time for minnows!
C03_EV1100_00035_PHAN	Give me time to get my fire back...
C03_EV1100_00040_BET1	I'll bet that stung.
C03_EV1100_00050_BET1	The glowing target was a bit on the nose.\nCould it be you've got a bit of a\nmasochistic streak?
C03_EVa1a3_00005_BET1	Perfect timing!
C03_EVa1a3_00010_PHAN	Expect nothing less!
C03_EVa1a3_00020_BET1	You'll pay dearly... for what you've done!
C03_EVa1a3_00030_BOS1	You cannot stop the inevitable.\nThis world's oblivion... and yours...\nare immutable fact.
C03_EV1110_00020_BOS1	This world's oblivion is now affirmed,\nbringing it closer to rebirth.
C03_EV1110_00030_BOS1	Arch-Eve, your power will become\na keystone of my Alphaverse...
C03_EV1110_00040_BOS1	...sustaining it for all eternity.
C03_EV1110_00060_BAYO	It's all right... I'll take it from here!
C03_EV1110_00070_BAYO	You will be avenged, I swear it.\nAnd so will Jeanne...
C03_EV1110_00080_BOS1	Ah, I see that whelp has convinced you\nto aid her, Arch-Eve Origin.
C03_EV1110_00090_BOS1	You've even managed to find the nexus\nand breach the barrier!
C03_EV1110_00100_BAYO	Not in the mood for cheap science fiction.\nI take it you're Singularity, then?\nThe real heart breaker.
C03_EV1110_00110_BOS1	Yes, if that's who you say I am.
C03_EV1110_00120_BAYO	Fantastic.\nBut you'll go through hell\ntrying to break mine!
C03_EV1110_00130_BAYO	DO O IA BAYONETTA!
C03_EV1110_00140_BAYO	CNILA D COMSELHA ODO ANANAEL!
C03_EV1110_00150_BAYO	IPAMIS NONCP FAFEN NIIS!
C03_EV1110_00160_BAYO	AVAVAGO TLIOB VRAN!
C03_EV1120_00010_BAYO	I know most of Inferno prefers a taste of\nthe righteous, but I'm sure you'll satisfy\nsomeone.
C03_EV1120_00020_BOS1	Surely you know this is merely a vessel?\nDo with it what you will.
C03_EV1120_00030_BOS1	The Arch-Eve has fallen,\nand this world will soon follow.
C03_EV1120_00035_BOS1	I eagerly await our next rendevous,\nArch-Eve Origin.
C03_EV1120_00040_BAYO	I'm not much for waiting patiently.
C03_EV1120_00050_BAYO	And I suppose that girl isn't either.
CHAPTER/chapter03_ta
C03_TA0010_00010_BAYO	Now where has my aquatic friend\ngotten off to?
C03_TA0035_00010_BAYO	Only the Luka I know would be\nbold enough to call me Cerezita.
C03_TA0035_00020_BAYO	It must have been him on Thule then, too...
C03_TA0035_00030_BAYO	What in the world is he doing here?
C03_TA0040_00010_BAYO	You're just full of tricks, aren't you?
C03_TA0065_00010_BET1	Not getting away that easy.
C03_TA0085_00010_BET1	At that speed, it's just a matter of time.
C03_TA0087_00010_BET1	So close!\nThe anticipation is killing me.
C03_TA0090_00010_BET1	That's enough tag for now.\nTime to get my hooks into you.
C03_TA0095_00010_BET1	D'you really think it would be that easy?\nOnce I see something I want, it's mine!
C03_TA0110_00010_BET1	If you're trying to swallow me whole,\nI'd go down easier with caviar.
CHAPTER/chapter04_ev
C04_EV2020_00010_BAYO	No time to relax, I see.
C04_EVa200_00010_BOS2	This world's timeline is in sync\nwith your own.
C04_EVa200_00020_BOS2	Although civilization has taken\na different course here.\nI have seen exactly 2,043 similar worlds.
C04_EVa200_00030_BAYO	Simply astounding.
C04_EVa200_00040_BOS2	You yourself are a woman out of time,\nare you not?
C04_EVa200_00050_BAYO	Yes, and I'd prefer not to waste that time\non your lectures.
C04_EVa200_00060_BAYO	They must be well trained\nto fight so fearlessly.\nI feel a bit inspired to take up arms myself!
C04_EV2040_00010_BET2	Fear not!\nNow is the time to charge forward!
C04_EV2040_00020_BET2	Our true enemy lies ahead.\nLeave this beast to my servant.
C04_EV2040_00030_BET2	Follow me!
C04_EV2045_00010_BAYO	Being drafted now, am I?\nAll right, let's just see how steamy\nthings can get.
C04_EVa20a_00020_BAYO	You poor thing... something about you just\npokes at my soft side.
C04_EVa20a_00030_GIRL	So dark...
C04_EVa20a_00040_GIRL	Walls closing in...
C04_EVa20a_00050_GIRL	Help!
C04_EVa20a_00060_GIRL	Uh, hey Bayonetta! Glad you're ok.\nJust handling some bad guys—
C04_EVa242_00010_GIRL	Come on...
C04_EVa242_00020_GIRL	Yeah? Yeah? 
C04_EVa242_00030_GIRL	Fuck yeah!
C04_EV2050_00010_GIRL	Uh, so anyway...
C04_EV2050_00020_GIRL	I was worried you might be floating in the\nasshole of the Multiverse or something.
C04_EV2050_00030_GIRL	Oh, and I didn't need your help back there.\nI could have squashed a bug like that myself.
C04_EV2050_00040_GIRL	I was just... waiting for the right moment,\nokay? Trying to get that sweet finisher\nand put it down for the—
C04_EV2050_00050_BAYO	Worry about yourself, my dear.
C04_EV2050_00060_BAYO	Lesson 1.\nCarelessness will get your tail snipped, kitty.
C04_EV2050_00070_GIRL	I-I told you not to call me that!
C04_EV2050_00080_GIRL	Anyway, did you find it?
C04_EV2050_00095_GIRL	
C04_EV2050_00090_GIRL	So the Chaos Gear was really there...
C04_EV2050_00100_GIRL	If the hypothesis is right, with five of these\nChaos Gears and help from Dr. Sigurd,\nthe Alphaverse is just—
C04_EV2050_00105_GIRL	Huh?
C04_EV2050_00110_BAYO	If these little things are really so important,\nthen I'd better hold onto them for now.
C04_EV2050_00120_BAYO	May be a bit too heavy for your little paws,\nkitty.
C04_EV2050_00130_GIRL	Don't make me say it again.
C04_EV2050_00140_GIRL	My name is Viola!\nV-I-O-L-fucking A Viola!
C04_EV2050_00160_LUKA	She's really under your skin, huh kid?
C04_EV2050_00170_LUKA	But, you gotta prove yourself to her \nif you want to move beyond nicknames.
CHAPTER/chapter04_ta
C04_TA0001_00010_BAYO	Now where has kitty gone off to?
C04_TA0001_00020_BAYO	Nursing a skinned knee perhaps...
C04_TA0005_00010_BAYO	Looking for someone with more bite?
C04_TA0007_00010_BAYO	I wonder what alternate reality\nawaits me this time?
C04_TA0020_00010_BAYO	The battle's really heating up.\nWhy don't you let me take care of this.
C04_TA0035_00010_BAYO	What a thoroughly unappealing sight.
C04_TA0040_00010_BAYO	I can hear something...\nWhat is it?
C04_TA0050_00010_GIRL	Think you're hot stuff, big boy?\nJust watch, I'll take you out solo!
C04_TA0090_00010_BAYO	What was that?\nYou wouldn't happen to be—
C04_TA0090_00020_GIRL	Wha?
C04_TA0090_00030_GIRL	Hey, don't get it twisted okay!\nI'm definitely not horribly claustrophobic\nat all, got it?
C04_TA0090_00040_GIRL	And do we really need to talk about that\nright now?\nI mean, we're kind of busy here!
C04_TA0070_00010_CSL1	
C04_TA0080_00010_CSL2	
C04_TA0090_00010_CSL3	
C04_TA0100_00010_CSL4	
C04_TA0120_00110_BAYO	When I'm done with you, you'll wish\nyou'd opted for the lizard's love tap.
C04_TA0140_00010_BAYO	There's nothing worse than unwanted\nguests taking root.
C04_TA0150_00010_BAYO	I'll just have to stamp you all out at once!
CHAPTER/chapter05_ev
C05_EV2055_00010_GIRL	Luka... ?
C05_EV2055_00020_LUKA	That's right, the one and only L-U-K-A...
C05_EV2055_00030_LUKA	Hang on—have we met before?\nI think I'd remember you, riot girl.
C05_EV2055_00040_GIRL	Huh? Uh...
C05_EV2055_00045_LUKA	Extra Ingenue...?
C05_EV2055_00050_LUKA	You...
C05_EV2055_00060_LUKA	It's time I got going.\nGotta find that voice...
C05_EV2055_00070_LUKA	Later ladies.
C05_EV2055_00070_BAYO	Kitty...\nWhy don't you look after him for me?
C05_EV2055_00080_GIRL	What?! Me? By myself?
C05_EV2055_00090_BAYO	Lesson 2.
C05_EV2055_00100_BAYO	Learn to fight for others,\nnot just for yourself.\nI'm sure he'll give you lots of practice.
C05_EV2055_00110_BAYO	And besides...
C05_EV2055_00120_GIRL	...What?
C05_EV2055_00130_BAYO	...You don't need my help, right?
C05_EV2055_00140_GIRL	W-Wait!
C05_EVa226_00010_GIRL	Huh? Wh, what?!\nOh shit shit shit!
C05_EVa227_00010_GIRL	I'm hot, soaked, and tired of this shit!
C05_EVa227_00020_GIRL	All right, focus.\nGotta find Luka, now!
C05_EVa227_00030_GIRL	Out of my way!
C05_EV2060_00010_GIRL	Luka... you in there? 
C05_EV2060_00030_GIRL	W-what was that?!
C05_EV2060_00040_GIRL	You want some too?!\nFine, it's bacon time!
C05_EVa228_00005_GIRL	Sayonara.
C05_EVa228_00010_GIRL	Oh, shit.\nJust when I thought I finally had him...
CHAPTER/chapter05_ta
C05_TA0110_00005_GIRL	They must have fought hard,\nright until the end.
C05_TA0110_00010_GIRL	Fucking Singularity!
C05_TA0110_00020_GIRL	Luka's probably okay though... right?
C05_TA0120_00010_GIRL	Luka! Wait!
C05_TA0130_00010_GIRL	You can take a break any time now!
C05_TA0140_00010_GIRL	Slow down, damn!\nI swear, it's like he can't hear me...
C05_TA0150_00010_ENZ2	Whoa, careful...
C05_TA0150_00020_ENZ2	Are your eyes on your feet?\nWatch out!
C05_TA0150_00030_ENZ2	And not a word to say?
C05_TA0150_00040_ENZ2	Damned kids these days...
C05_TA0160_00010_GIRL	He better be careful, or he's gonna end up\nflash-fried...
C05_TA0200_00010_GIRL	No no no!! This is the only outfit I brought!
C05_TA0201_00010_GIRL	Gotta find water, fast!
C05_TA0203_00010_GIRL	AHH! Hot hot HOT!
CHAPTER/chapter06_ev
C06_EVa2a0_00010_BAYO	That's the ticket.
C06_EVa2a0_00020_BET2	I believe you two have already met.\nLet's go!
C06_EV2070_00020_BOS2	The power that bound this world is\nnow mine, and its inevitable collapse\nis moments away.
C06_EV2070_00030_BOS2	And while I have no further use\nfor this shell...
C06_EV2070_00040_BOS2	There's time for a bit of amusement.\nPerhaps I'll simply crush you like an insect\nright now.
C06_EV2070_00050_BAYO	DO O IA BAYONETTA!
C06_EV2070_00060_BAYO	CNILA D COMSELHA ODO ANANAEL!
C06_EV2070_00070_BAYO	TURBS C BABALON ZONAC\nCIAOFI BALZARG!
C06_EV2070_00075_BAYO	FAFEN NIIS!
C06_EV2070_00080_BAYO	What was that about crushing?
C06_EV2070_00090_BAYO	I think you'll find we're extremely game\nfor that.
C06_EV2080_00010_BAYO	Looks like some spirited tenderizing\ncan make even you look tasty.
C06_EV2080_00020_BOS2	Quite amusing Arch-Eve Origin,\nbut I have other affairs.
C06_EV2080_00030_BOS2	You needn't waste time searching for me.\nWhen the time is right, we'll have a proper\nrendevous.
C06_EV2080_00040_BOS2	Though I don't suppose you believe in\ndelayed gratification.\nUntil next time...
C06_EV2080_00050_BAYO	Was that... ?
CHAPTER/chapter06_ta
C06_TA0011_00010_BAYO	Are these statues of generals?\nYou'd think there'd be one of me by now!
C06_TA0012_00010_BAYO	Barging in on a lady unannounced?\nBold, but unwise.
C06_TA0050_00010_BAYO	Someone doesn't want me to join the party.
C06_TA0052_00010_BAYO	Shame about the tower...\nBut I can think of a new purpose for it.
C06_TA0060_00020_BAYO	Looks like I'm nearing the crater.\nI certainly hope the Chaos Gear isn't\ninside...
C06_TA0070_00010_BAYO	Come down the mountain just for me?\nI hope you brought something I'll like.
C06_TA0080_00010_BAYO	Unfortunately, I can't join you in that bath.\nThe excessive heat's hell on my skin.
C06_TA0090_00010_BAYO	But, come to think of it,\nI have a friend who really likes it hot.
C06_TA0095_00010_NARR	There's nothing to fear Arch-Eve.\nDeath is no final destination, merely a gate.
C06_TA0095_00020_NARR	Both you and this world have no choice\nbut to pass through.
C06_TA0095_00030_NARR	Die alone, brute.\nThis world is under my protection!
C06_TA0100_00010_BAYO	Hope you like hot lead as much as hot lava!
C06_TA0110_00010_BET2	The time has come!\nNow to free the beast from its rails!
CHAPTER/chapter07_ev
C07_EV3000_00020_GIRL	Just great...
C07_EV3000_00030_GIRL	Glad Bayonetta wasn't here to see that...\n"You've only got nine lives, kitty!"
C07_EV3000_00040_GIRL	That wolf-dude's here too?!
C07_EV3000_00050_GIRL	Better find Luka quick!
C07_EV3010_00020_GIRL	Shit!\nIs this desert out to get me or something?!
C07_EV3010_00030_GIRL	Uh, where is this desert anyway?
C07_EV3010_00040_GIRL	...Fucking really?\nJust great, now Cheshire's gone too! 
C07_EVa302_00020_GIRL	OW SHIT FUCK AHHH!
C07_EVa302_00030_GIRL	I can't. I just... can't.
C07_EVa302_00040_GIRL	I am not... gonna die here!
C07_EVa302_00050_GIRL	Cheshire!
C07_EVa302_00060_GIRL	Come on!
C07_EVa305_00010_GIRL	I swear I can't take you anywhere.
C07_EVa306_00020_GIRL	Ahh... I thought.... I was done for.
C07_EVa306_00040_GIRL	 'Preciate it, Cheshire.
C07_EVa306_00050_GIRL	All right, it's magic time.\nHang on, Luka!
C07_EVa304_00010_GIRL	Luka!
C07_EV3020_00010_GIRL	Luka? You okay?
C07_EV3020_00020_LUKA	Stop... stop please!
C07_EV3020_00030_GIRL	Well, you're breathing at least...
C07_EV3020_00040_GIRL	Don't worry, they're all gone.
C07_EV3020_00050_GIRL	Are you hurt? Can you get up?
C07_EV3020_00070_LUKA	Stay back!
C07_EV3020_00080_LUKA	Damn.... my head...\nFeels like it's cracking open!
C07_EV3020_00090_LUKA	That voice... again!
C07_EV3020_00100_GIRL	Voice?
C07_EV3020_00110_LUKA	In my head... telling me... to see...\nthe truth!
C07_EV3020_00120_LUKA	There's only... one... truth.
C07_EV3020_00130_GIRL	...Luka?
C07_EV3020_00140_GIRL	No...
C07_EV3020_00150_GIRL	No, it can't be!
C07_EV3030_00010_GIRL	Gah, damn sand...
C07_EV3040_00010_BAYO	Ran off to bully Little Red Riding Hood,\ndid you? Predictable.
C07_EV3040_00020_GIRL	Wait!
C07_EV3040_00030_BAYO	What are you up to, kitty?
C07_EV3040_00040_GIRL	You can't!\nYou don't know... who he really is.
C07_EV3040_00050_BAYO	Impossible...
C07_EV3040_00060_GIRL	Each world the Multiverse loses seems\nto be making it more and more unstable.
C07_EV3040_00070_GIRL	It's why he's... like that.
C07_EV3040_00080_GIRL	Please, wait!
C07_EV3040_00090_GIRL	If we can get to the Alphaverse and stop\nSingularity, we might be able to help him.
C07_EV3040_00100_BAYO	"Might" isn't good enough.
C07_EV3040_00105_BAYO	And at any rate, I only have three of these.
C07_EV3040_00110_GIRL	Let me take care of him!
C07_EV3040_00120_BAYO	I'm in no mood for jokes.
C07_EV3040_00130_GIRL	Please!
C07_EV3040_00140_GIRL	You have to be the one to find\nall of the Chaos Gears.
C07_EV3040_00150_GIRL	Look, I know how you feel...
C07_EV3040_00160_BAYO	So?
C07_EV3040_00170_GIRL	...But trust me.
C07_EV3040_00180_GIRL	He means a lot to me, too.
C07_EV3040_00190_BAYO	He's a bit of a fool, and a reckless one at\nthat. Always getting himself into some kind\nof trouble.
C07_EV3040_00200_BAYO	But, he always pops back up with that\nfoolish grin, no worse for the wear.\nThis time will be no different.
C07_EV3040_00210_BAYO	However...
C07_EV3040_00220_BAYO	If he doesn't pop back up this time,\nI'll have you tearing apart reality to\nfind him.
C07_EV3040_00230_BAYO	Got that, kitty?
C07_EV3040_00240_GIRL	Yeah, I got it.
C07_EV3040_00242_GIRL	Sir yes sir!
C07_EV3040_00244_GIRL	Shit!
C07_EV3040_00250_BAYO	Much better.
C07_EV3040_00252_BAYO	Now off you go.
C07_EV3040_00254_GIRL	And hey, the name's Viola!
C07_EV3040_00256_GIRL	Don't forget it!
CHAPTER/chapter07_ta
C07_TA0300_00010_GIRL	He's close... I can feel it!
C07_TA0310_00010_GIRL	What's up with this door?\nIs it broken?
C07_TA3010_00010_GIRL	Hey, what the—
C07_TA0210_00010_GIRL	Come back, Cheshire!
C07_TA0210_00020_GIRL	Well, that didn't work.\nHe must be too far out of range... 
C07_TA0010_00010_GIRL	Cheshire, where are you?\n
C07_TA0040_00010_GIRL	I'd kill for a drink right now...\nIce water... hell, an ice cube...
C07_TA0050_00010_GIRL	Sand is getting literally everywhere.\nCheshire, where the hell are you?
C07_TA0220_00010_GIRL	Cheshire, where are you...
C07_TA0230_00010_GIRL	So hot...  can't see straight...
C07_TA0240_00010_GIRL	Ca... can't... walk any... more...
C07_TA0400_00010_GIRL	Wa... ter...
C07_TA0090_00010_GIRL	Where are you, you mangy psycho!
C07_TA0100_00010_GIRL	You'd better be okay, Luka!
C07_TA0150_00010_GIRL	Damn, it's like a huge river!\nBetter steer clear of that natural wonder.
C07_TA0170_00010_GIRL	It's moving pretty fast.\nBetter find a safe spot quick!
C07_TA0180_00010_GIRL	Shit!\nIt's pulling... me... under!
C07_TA0500_00010_GIRL	Okay, Luka, funny joke!\nLittle early for Halloween though,\ndon't you think?
C07_TA0520_00010_GIRL	Come on, snap out of it!
C07_TA0190_00010_GIRL	Shit, where'd he go?\nI can't see a thing!
CHAPTER/chapter08_ev
C08_EV3050_00010_BETJ	That is enough!
C08_EV3050_00020_BET3	You mustn't go... alone.
C08_EV3050_00030_BETJ	The interloper has extended the challenge\nto me. I will meet it, and then return.\nHave faith.
C08_EV3050_00040_BETJ	I'll see you again soon, princess.
C08_EV3055_00010_BAEL	A powerful witch with regal beauty and fire...\nPerhaps I can hang my hopes on you.
C08_EV3055_00020_BAEL	Please, you must save my mistress.
C08_EV3055_00030_BAYO	Well of course, that's why I've come.\nI've always wanted to rescue the lady fair.
C08_EV3055_00040_BAEL	I must thank you, noble witch.\nPerhaps a song—
C08_EV3055_00050_BAYO	Save the audition.\nTime is short.
C08_EVa32f_00010_BAYO	Quite the power lunch.\nSure you'll be all right?
C08_EVa32f_00020_BAYO	I was only joking!
C08_EVa32f_00030_BAEL	Not... the creature.\nMy mistress... is growing weaker...
C08_EVa32f_00040_BAEL	But all is... not lost... hurry...\nPlease... you must... find her... 
C08_EVa32f_00050_BAYO	Jeanne... I'm coming.
CHAPTER/chapter08_ta
C08_TA0050_00010_BAYO	The frogs seem to like it as well.
C08_TA2010_00010_BETJ	Princess, you must not follow!
C08_TA2010_00020_BAYO	Is that... Jeanne?\nAnd "princess?" You must be joking.
C08_TA0075_00010_BETJ	Please, return and leave this to me!
C08_TA0078_00010_BAYO	Is your grand scheme simply\nto bore me to death?
C08_TA0200_00010_BETJ	I made it clear you were not to follow.
C08_TA0200_00020_BAYO	And when someone gives me an order,\nI just have to disobey.
C08_TA0200_00030_BETJ	You really are quite the headstrong one...
C08_TA0200_00040_BETJ	I'll have to force you to listen, then.\nPrepare yourself!
C08_TA0080_00010_BAYO	Cut down one another pops up.\nUgh... I'm not here to pull weeds.
C08_TA0090_00010_BAYO	A bit of herbicide from heaven\nwould be wonderful.
C08_TA0130_00010_BAYO	No need to tense up that badly.\nRelax! We're just getting started.
CHAPTER/chapter09_ev
C09_EVa360_00010_BAYO	This must be the place.
C09_EV3060_00030_BET3	What was it that Jeanne used to say...\n"Your lack of conviction is your weakness."
C09_EV3060_00040_BET3	Here's the proof of my conviction.
C09_EV3060_00060_BET3	I'm coming, Jeanne.
C09_EV3065_00020_BAYO	This should make getting around a breeze.
C09_EVa38f_00010_BAYO	And that makes four... quite a handful, these.
C09_EVa38f_00020_BAYO	If all this effort doesn't make for a\nhappy ending, I'll have some harsh words\nfor that girl.
C09_EVa38f_00030_BAYO	Even more so if she's not keeping an eye\non Luka.
C09_EVa38f_00040_BAYO	For some reason that kitty is\nscratching around in my mind.\nWhat has come over me?
C09_EVa38f_00050_BAYO	I thought this was all a bit too easy.
C09_EV3070_00010_BS3A	Find what you were looking for?
C09_EV3070_00020_BS3A	You won't be the last person\ndestroyed by greed.
C09_EV3070_00030_BETJ	Princess?
C09_EV3070_00035_BETJ	Curse this damned wall!
C09_EV3070_00040_BAYO	Relax, Jeanne.\nI'm not your princess, but I did promise\nour mutual friend that I'd come for you.
C09_EV3070_00050_BS3B	Risking your existence\nfor the sake of another...
C09_EV3070_00060_BS3B	You clearly have no understanding\nof your part in all of this.
C09_EV3070_00070_BS3A	Ignorance makes you all weak.
C09_EV3070_00080_BAYO	Sounds like someone has led\na rather solitary life, doesn't it?
C09_EV3070_00090_BETJ	Indeed. \nAnd we'll waste no more time\non this foolishness!
C09_EV3070_00100_BS3B	I think not, Arch Eve.
C09_EV3070_00105_BS3A	You'll be keeping me company\nuntil the very end.
C09_EV3070_00110_BOS3	Now... let your oblivion be defined.
C09_EV3080_00020_BAYO	Jeanne!!
C09_EV3080_00030_BETJ	Forget about me.
C09_EV3080_00040_BETJ	You've got to kill this beast... and me.\nDo it, now!
C09_EV3080_00050_BETJ	Quickly, damn it!\nPlease...
C09_EV3080_00060_BET3	Forgive me... my weakness failed you again...
C09_EV3080_00070_BETJ	No... you've grown stronger than you know...\nCereza...
C09_EV3080_00080_BET3	I'm not the woman I used to be.
C09_EV3080_00090_BET3	Now watch, Jeanne...\nI'll never bow to anyone again...\nnot even myself!
C09_EV3085_00010_BOS3	Hmm...\nThe Arch-Eve's death should have\nset this world's end in motion...
C09_EV3085_00020_BOS3	It is as if this world rejects its destiny.
C09_EV3085_00030_BOS3	Unless... \nCould there be a new Arch-Eve?
C09_EV3085_00010_BAYO	DO O IA BAYONETTA!
C09_EV3085_00020_BAYO	CNILA D COMSELHA ODO ANANAEL!
C09_EV3085_00030_BAYO	MALPRG ROR MICAOLI IALPON ILS!
C09_EV3085_00035_BAYO	FAFEN NIIS!
C09_EV3085_00050_SPHA	Listen well, mistress!\nThis superheated body can only last\na few minutes!
C09_EV3090_00010_SPHA	The endless flame that courses through\nme... can no longer be controlled!
C09_EV3090_00020_BOS3	Impressive, Arch-Eve.\nTo think you contained such power inside.
C09_EV3090_00030_BET3	Jeanne... did you see?
C09_EV3090_00035_BET3	I won...
CHAPTER/chapter09_ta
C09_TA0012_00010_BAYO	"Haste makes waste," is it?\nDetours aren't my style,\nbut I suppose there's no choice.
C09_TA0015_00010_NARR	Welcome, Arch-Eve Origin.\nI trust you're having a pleasant journey?
C09_TA0015_00020_BAYO	It seems someone would rather I wasn't.
C09_TA0015_00030_BAYO	Perhaps you've got something\nmore interesting in store?
C09_TA0025_00010_BAYO	I'd recognize the rancid air of Inferno\nanywhere... an unexpected chill in the\nmiddle of the desert.
C09_TA0026_00010_BAYO	Could a few naughty ones\nhave snuck through as well?
C09_TA0060_00010_BAYO	These pesky gnats just don't stop.\nWhy don't you blow them off for me?
C09_TA0070_00010_BAYO	Sometimes the scenic route\nactually pays off.
C09_TA0100_00010_BAYO	Still windmills don't do much for the decor.
C09_TA0105_00010_BAYO	Hmm...\nLooks like one blow may not be enough.
C09_TA0130_00010_BAYO	If I can find a way to lift that...
C09_TA0170_00010_BAYO	Quite a collection...\nEnzo might actually shut up for once\nif he saw this.
C09_TA0200_00010_BAYO	It's getting a bit overcrowded here.
C09_TA0210_00010_BAYO	It can't be my fault,\nI've been cutting carbs since spring.
C09_TA0220_00010_BAYO	Can't let this side get too light\nor Jeanne's in trouble.
C09_TA0300_00010_BET3	Feel the rage of Malphas!
C09_TA0310_00010_BET3	For Jeanne!
C09_TA0320_00010_BET3	No effect... Is that a barrier?
C09_TA0330_00010_BET3	Another barrier?\nSpinner of flame, I leave it to you!
C09_TA0340_00010_SPHA	Damn it!\nA filthy barrier blocks my flame!
C09_TA0350_00010_SPHA	More damn barriers!\nIt's up to you, tamer of winds! 
C09_TA0360_00010_SPHA	Wind rider, there's no time to lose!
C09_TA0370_00010_SPHA	Hurry, tamer of winds!\nI'm almost at my limit!
C09_TA0380_00010_SPHA	The end... is here!\nConsumed by my own flame... madness!
CHAPTER/chapter10_ev
C10_EV4015_00010_GIRL	The hell?!
C10_EV4015_00020_GIRL	What is this...?
C10_EV4015_00030_GIRL	Luka!
C10_EV4020_00010_KING	Woman, hail you from the same sphere\nas that beast-man?
C10_EV4020_00020_GIRL	...L, Luka?
C10_EV4020_00030_KING	Luka... so he is called Luka.
C10_EV4020_00040_KING	I am Lukaon.
C10_EV4020_00050_GIRL	What is this place?\nAnd where did Luka go?
C10_EV4020_00060_KING	He no longer tarries here.
C10_EV4020_00070_KING	That beast-man is surely my else-fellow.
C10_EV4020_00080_KING	It seems we were drawn together across\nthe world-walls to find each other here.
C10_EV4020_00090_GIRL	Drawn together?\n...Then what am I doing here?
C10_EV4020_00100_KING	It appears as though you also\nshare a bond most deep with us.
C10_EV4020_00110_KING	A bond of blood perhaps?\nBrother and sister... or something more.
C10_EV4020_00120_KING	Woman... I know you...
C10_EV4020_00130_KING	The voice... calls to me...
C10_EV4020_00140_GIRL	Wait!\nWhat are you saying? Don't go!
C10_EV4030_00010_WOLF	...Kid?\nGet back... now!
C10_EV4040_00010_GIRL	Luka... please... stop!\nI don't want to hurt you!
C10_EV4040_00020_GIRL	We might be from different worlds,\nbut I know you feel it.
C10_EV4040_00030_GIRL	It's me... I'm your...
CHAPTER/chapter10_ta
C10_TA0010_00010_GIRL	What's that light?
C10_TA0010_00020_GIRL	It's strange, but I feel like it's calling me...
C10_TA0030_00010_GIRL	Looks like this could go at any minute...
C10_TA0030_00020_GIRL	I'd better pick up the pace or else...
C10_TA0045_00010_GIRL	Is Luka here too?
C10_TA0060_00010_WOLF	Stay away!
C10_TA0060_00020_WOLF	The voice... it's in my head again!
C10_TA0060_00030_GIRL	Voice?\nWhose voice?
C10_TA0060_00040_WOLF	It's... my voice!
C10_TA0060_00050_WOLF	Another me, in my head...\nsince... I was a kid!
C10_TA0060_00060_GIRL	Your voice?\nCould it be...
C10_TA0060_00070_WOLF	But is this... really me?
C10_TA0060_00080_WOLF	Is this... the truth?
CHAPTER/chapter11_ev
C11_EV4050_00010_BAYO	Kitty...
C11_EV4060_00010_BET4	There it is.\nOur new prize.
C11_EV4060_00020_ROSA	Mon fille, do a sweep of security.
C11_EV4060_00030_ENZ4	Ha ha ha, I have you now, Papillon d'Ombre!\nNo one is above the law!
C11_EV4060_00040_ROSA	A pleasure as always,\nInspector Enzeau.
C11_EV4060_00050_ENZ4	"A pleasure," she says.\nLet's see how pleasurable you find jail!
C11_EV4060_00060_BET4	Maîtresse, there's trouble.\nWe've no time for the likes of him!
C11_EV4060_00070_ENZ4	What!\nI'm taking you in too!
C11_EV4060_00080_ROSA	After them!\nWe must not let it fall into their hands!
C11_EV4060_00090_ENZ4	Get back here!\nMerde! My wife hates it when I work late!
C11_EV4060_00100_BET4	Find the gear, and maman!
C11_EV4065_00010_BAYO	Mummy...
C11_EV4065_00020_BAYO	Asking me to come along?\nThen we'd better be off.
C11_EV4070_00010_BAYO	Mummy!
C11_EV4070_00020_BAYO	What has he done to her!?
C11_EV4076_00010_ENZ4	Damn it!\nNo wings can save you from justice!
C11_EV4076_00020_BAYO	Just let me handle this!
C11_EV4076_00030_ENZ4	Have you gone mad?\nThat's it, I'm taking you in too! Just wait!
C11_EV4076_00040_BAYO	Ugh... Enzo on the other side of the law\nmay be worse.
C11_EV4080_00005_BAYO	Mummy...
C11_EV4080_00010_ROSA	Forget about me!\nDestroy this abomination.. now!
C11_EV4080_00015_ROSA	Now...
C11_EV4080_00020_ROSA	Thank you, Cereza...
C11_EV4080_00030_BAYO	And I thought we were becoming friends.
CHAPTER/chapter11_ta
C11_TA0010_00010_BAYO	It looks like I'm on the clock.\nBetter find that Gear quickly.
C11_TA0020_00010_BAYO	Is that...
C11_TA0030_00010_BAYO	Didn't anyone teach you not to interfere\nin family business?
C11_TA0100_00010_ENZ4	Kiss your freedom goodbye,\nPapillon d'Ombre!
C11_TA0110_00010_ENZ4	One of you, get me a rocket launcher!\nThat should stop her in her tracks!
C11_TA0120_00010_ENZ4	Just you wait, Papillon!
C11_TA0120_00020_ENZ4	In the name of Enzeau,\nI swear I'll clip your wings!
C11_TA0105_00010_FSL6	Attention all units.\nWe have reports of friendly fire.
C11_TA0105_00020_FSL6	The cause is unknown, but they seem to\nbe under outside control. 
C11_TA0105_00025_FSL6	The number of affected personnel\nis also increasing.
C11_TA0105_00030_FSL6	Operation under these conditions\nis dangerous. If you can, retreat\nto the city limits immediately.
C11_TA0100_00010_FSL1	Come in, come in! Is anybody there!\nDamn, they can't all be down...
C11_TA0110_00010_FSL2	HQ, do you read?\nOur weapons are completely ineffective!\nWhat are these things...
C11_TA0110_00020_FSL2	HQ, come in! What should we do?\nWhat are our orders?!
CHAPTER/chapter12_ev
C12_EV4090_00010_BAYO	And what was that?
C12_EV4090_00020_BET4	Oh, that?\nA simple bonsoir.
C12_EV4090_00030_BET4	Just wait until I really get chatty.
C12_EV4100_00010_BAYO	Get down!
C12_EV4100_00040_BOS4	You've lost control of your emotions,\nand yourself.
C12_EV4100_00050_BOS4	It's so easy to ensare\nsuch single-minded prey.
C12_EV4100_00060_BET4	...Who... are you?!
C12_EV4100_00070_BOS4	The one who will show you\nyour true potential.
C12_EV4100_00080_BOS4	Now, Arch-Eve Origin.\nWhat, if anything, can you do for her?

C12_EV4100_00140_SBAE	Oh my, such a large audience!\nI'd better jump into the chorus then.
C12_EV4110_00010_BAYO	May you be reunited with your mummy...
C12_EV4110_00020_FIXR	Hmm...\nWhere has that confident smile gone?
C12_EV4110_00030_FIXR	I take no pleasure in tormenting the weak,\nbut your panic was a welcome diversion.
C12_EV4110_00040_FIXR	There's no need to rush.\nThe events of our encounters\nare already determined.
C12_EV4110_00050_FIXR	We'll be seeing each other very soon.
C12_EV4110_00060_FIXR	Very soon indeed...
C12_EV4110_00070_BAYO	This will all end soon as well.
C12_EV4110_00080_BAYO	Very soon indeed.
CHAPTER/chapter12_ta
C10_TA0020_00010_BAYO	Getting the locals involved...\nYou'll pay for that.
C12_TA0120_00010_FSL3	Shoot, shoot damn it.\nIf you stop you'll be killed!
C12_TA0130_00010_FSL4	S-stop! We're not the enemy!
C12_TA0130_00020_FSL4	What am I supposed to do...\nI can't shoot another soldier...
C12_TA0130_00030_FSL4	Stop! Don't move any closer!\nI mean it, damn it!
C12_TA0130_00040_FSL4	It's no use...\nDamn... ngh... a, aaaggghhh!
C12_TA0140_00010_FSL5	HQ, HQ!\nWe're being pursued by flying enemies.
C12_TA0140_00020_FSL5	Get back, damn you!\nGah... n-nooooooo!
C12_TA0140_00030_FSL5	
C10_TA0030_00010_BAYO	It's time to end this madness...\nOnce and for all!
C10_TA0030_00020_BAYO	May they all finally know rest...
C12_TA0200_00010_BAYO	I think you have me mistaken\nfor someone else.
C12_TA0200_00020_BET4	Mistaken?\nOur line of work doesn't allow for\n"mistaken," chère.
C12_TA0210_00010_BET4	You're about to become very intimate with\nthe pain you gave Maîtresse... ma maman.
C12_TA0220_00010_BET4	And no amount of pleading for your life\nwill stop me!
CHAPTER/chapter13_ev
C13_EV5020_00010_JANN	Doctor, allow me to introduce\nmy dear friend, Cereza.
C13_EV5020_00020_JANN	Cereza, this dashing fellow is Dr. Sigurd\nHe's come quite a distance for us.
C13_EV5020_00030_DOCT	A pleasure to meet you, Cereza.
C13_EV5020_00040_DOCT	Jeanne has told me much about you\nduring our trip.
C13_EV5020_00050_BAYO	Did she?\nI hope at least some of it was actually true.
C13_EV5020_00060_BAYO	Jeanne has a habit of showing off\nfor the gentlemen.
C13_EV5020_00070_JANN	You bitch!
C13_EV5020_00080_DOCT	I can see that you are very close, but\nthat's enough chat. You've brought me\nhere for a singular purpose, yes?
C13_EV5020_00090_DOCT	To open a portal to the Alphaverse.
C13_EV5020_00100_BAYO	...Yes.
C13_EV5020_00110_BAYO	Sadly, I have a date with a terrible bore.
C13_EV5020_00120_JANN	Singularity...
C13_EV5020_00130_JANN	We'll knock down his door, wring his neck,\nand end all of this destruction.
C13_EV5020_00140_JANN	It's time to finish this!
C13_EV5020_00150_DOCT	Then Cereza,\nI trust you have what we need?\n
C13_EV5020_00160_DOCT	Now, follow me to the altar.
C13_EV5020_00170_DOCT	Stand back.
C13_EV5020_00180_DOCT	Cereza, place the Chaos Gears\nin their proper locations.
C13_EV5030_00010_BAYO	Come to see us off?
C13_EV5030_00020_BAYO	If you're looking for a ride back home,\nyou'll have to wait for the next one.
C13_EV5030_00030_JANN	The vermin don't know when to quit!
C13_EV5030_00040_DOCT	If this device is damaged, we'll never\nbe able to open the portal again!
C13_EV5030_00050_BAYO	Doctor, you just keep working.
C13_EV5030_00060_BAYO	Jeanne!
C13_EV5030_00070_DOCT	Damn! The portal will close!
C13_EV5030_00080_JANN	Go, Cereza!\nYou're the only one who can end this!
C13_EV5030_00090_BAYO	Then I'll leave this lot to you.
C13_EV5030_00100_BAYO	Promise I'll be back in time for drinks,\nall right?
C13_EV5030_00110_JANN	Cereza will return, count on it.
C13_EV5030_00115_JANN	And until she does, they won't\nlay a finger on this thing.
C13_EV5030_00120_DOCT	Can you really defend it against all of them?\nIf it's destroyed, then her chances are...
C13_EV5030_00130_JANN	Don't you worry about that.\nI'm more than enough for them.
C13_EV5050_00010_BAYO	How thoughtful of you to meet up halfway.\nYou've saved me a bit of time.
C13_EV5050_00030_BAYO	Consider this a generous tip.\nNow let's see you earn it, shall we?
C13_EV5090_00030_BAYO	How...\nWhat are you doing here?
C13_EV5090_00040_BAYO	Always getting in over your head...
C13_EV5090_00050_BAYO	I'll take care of you.
C13_EV5090_00060_BAYO	That's right.\nI'm going to take you back home.
C13_EV5090_00070_BAYO	Are you frightened, Luka?
C13_EV5090_00080_BAYO	Your hands are shaking.
C13_EV5090_00090_BAYO	Poor thing.\nLet me help you.
C13_EV5100_00010_ADAM	Cere... zi... ta...
C13_EV5100_00020_BAYO	You have no fucking right\nto call me by that name!
C13_EV5110_00010_BAYO	Luka...
C13_EV5110_00020_BAYO	Kitty?
C13_EV5110_00030_GIRL	...Bayonetta!
C13_EV5110_00040_BAYO	Luka!
C13_EV5110_00050_KING	Fear not, for he is at peace.
C13_EV5110_00060_KING	It seems we have been drawn\ninto the Alphaverse.
C13_EV5120_00010_GIRL	Mu...
C13_EV5120_00020_GIRL	Bayonetta, come here!
C13_EV5120_00030_BAYO	Hm?
C13_EV5120_00040_GIRL	Is this... the Homunculus nerve center?
C13_EV5120_00050_BAYO	It would seem so.
C13_EV5120_00060_BAYO	He must have sacrificed one of\nhis own counterparts to control\nthe Homunculi from here.
C13_EV5120_00070_GIRL	His own counterpart?
C13_EV5120_00080_GIRL	Then this man has to be... 
C13_EV5120_00090_BAYO	Kitty.
C13_EV5120_00100_GIRL	Dr. Sigurd!
C13_EV5120_00110_GIRL	That means the real Singularity... fuck!
C13_EV5120_00120_BAYO	We've been had.
C13_EV5120_00130_DOCT	You have been very helpful,\nbut that will be quite enough.
C13_EV5120_00150_DOCT	Goodbye, Jeanne.\nOur time together was short,\nbut unforgettable nonetheless.
C13_EV5120_00160_JANN	Cereza...!
C13_EV5120_00170_DOCT	Once its purpose is done,\nall life must fade away.\nNow... mine begins.
C13_EV5120_00180_DOCT	Come children, let's go home.
CHAPTER/chapter13_ta
C13_TA0520_00010_BAYO	We'll just have to take our time.
C13_TA0530_00010_BAYO	Excellent!\nKeep it up!
C13_TA0540_00010_BAYO	All right!\nJust one left.
C13_TA0500_00010_BAYO	Wipe that look off your face, Luka.
C13_TA0500_00020_BAYO	It doesn't suit you at all.
C13_TA0500_00030_WOLF	Bayonetta... stay away from me...
C13_TA0500_00040_WOLF	I don't know... what's true any... more!
C13_TA0500_00050_BAYO	The truth is that you're a clumsy fool...\nbut one I can't imagine life without.
C13_TA0500_00060_WOLF	Ever since I was a kid,\nthere's been a voice in my head....\nalways telling me to seek the truth!
C13_TA0500_00070_WOLF	When I listened to it,\nthings always worked out okay...\nThat's why I've obeyed it my whole life.
C13_TA0500_00080_WOLF	Truth is, I'm not\n"the marvelous Luka Redgrave"...\nI'm... just some pathetic nobody!
C13_TA0500_00090_WOLF	I guess...\nI finally got what was coming to me.
C13_TA0500_00100_WOLF	I had... no business coming here...\nAnd now I'm... losing myself.
C13_TA0500_00110_WOLF	This is who I really am!\nA hate-filled, murderous demon!\nThe same as all those other monsters!
C13_TA0500_00120_BAYO	Got it all out of your system?
C13_TA0500_00130_BAYO	Now come on.\nIt's time we went home.
C13_TA0590_00010_WOLF	Cere... zita...
C13_TA0590_00020_WOLF	The... truth...
C13_TA0590_00030_WOLF	
C13_TA0590_00040_WOLF	
C13_TA0590_00050_WOLF	Show me the truth!
C13_TA0590_00060_WOLF	Cerezita!
C13_TA0590_00070_WOLF	
CHAPTER/chapter14_ev
C14_EV6000_00010_GIRL	So the Alphaverse was always just a decoy...\nHe wanted us here... and away from Thule.
C14_EV6000_00020_GIRL	That means...
C14_EV6000_00030_BAYO	Jeanne...
C14_EV6000_00040_GIRL	We're trapped here... with no way out.
C14_EV6000_00050_KING	It would seem these events are the truth\nI was shown.
C14_EV6000_00060_KING	Now, let the hearts of all Arch-Adams \ngather here as one.
C14_EV6000_00070_LUKA	Hey... Cerezita.
C14_EV6000_00080_BAYO	Luka!
C14_EV6000_00090_LUKA	I finally figured out what the truth is.
C14_EV6000_00100_LUKA	Bayonetta... my purpose...
C14_EV6000_00110_LUKA	...is to get you to where you need to be.
C14_EV6000_00120_LUKA	Look.
C14_EV6000_00130_LUKA	That vortex is Singularity\nabsorbing this world's energy.
C14_EV6000_00140_GIRL	Luka, what are you trying to say?
C14_EV6000_00150_LUKA	I'm going to use it to send you two home.
C14_EV6000_00160_GIRL	From there?\nBut... how?
C14_EV6000_00170_LUKA	Wish I knew just what to say\nat a time like this...
C14_EV6000_00180_BAYO	You don't have to.
C14_EV6000_00190_BAYO	You're a clumsy fool...\nbut you never fail to impress.
C14_EV6000_00200_LUKA	Later, Violita.
C14_EV6000_00210_LUKA	Goodbye, Bayonetta.
C14_EV6000_00220_LUKA	I'll always love you both...
C14_EV6000_00230_GIRL	Cheshire!
C14_EV6000_00240_GIRL	Bayonetta, come on!
C14_EV6000_00250_BAYO	Of course, kitty!
C14_EV6000_00260_GIRL	My name... is VI—
C14_EV6000_00270_GIRL	My name is VIOLAAAAAAA!
C14_EV6005_00010_BAYO	Is this...
C14_EV6005_00020_BAYO	Kitty!
C14_EV6005_00030_BAYO	Luka!
C14_EV6010_00010_FIXR	Arch-Eve Origin...\nWhat are you doing here?
C14_EV6010_00020_FIXR	This is a world of my definition.\nYou do not belong.
C14_EV6010_00030_BAYO	But here I am, and that's the truth.
C14_EV6010_00040_BAYO	Maybe you forgot to carry the one?
C14_EV6010_00050_BAYO	DO O IA BAYONETTA!

C14_EV6020_00003_BAYO	TURBS C BABALON ZONAC\nCIAOFI BALZARG!
C14_EV6020_00004_BAYO	FAFEN NIIS!
C14_EV6020_00010_BAYO	Flying to the moon without me?\nCan't have that.
C14_EV6030_00010_FIXR	Your struggle is pointless.
C14_EV6030_00020_FIXR	This course of events is an immutable truth.\nOne which only I can change.
C14_EV6030_00030_BAYO	Maybe that's how things work\nwhere you're from,\n
C14_EV6030_00040_BAYO	but I prefer to make my own truth.
C14_EV6040_00010_FIXR	Impossible!\nYou outstrip my ability to\nalter phenomena...
C14_EV6040_00020_BAYO	Clearly you haven't been paying attention.
C14_EV6040_00025_BAYO	The truth is what I make it!
C14_EV6044_00010_BAYO	Jeanne!
C14_EV6044_00020_JANN	Let's go.
C14_EV6060_00010_FIXR	Surely you must have had enough by now.
C14_EV6060_00020_BAYO	You're not... getting nervous are you?
C14_EV6070_00010_GIRL	What!?
C14_EV6070_00020_GIRL	Bastard!
C14_EV6070_00030_FIXR	Ah, the brave soldier returns.
C14_EV6070_00040_FIXR	You did promise me that you'd be back...
C14_EV6070_00045_GIRL	Damn you!
C14_EV6070_00050_FIXR	...but no matter what you desired, \nour reunion here was predetermined.
C14_EV6070_00060_FIXR	As was this woman's ignoble end!
C14_EV6070_00070_BAYO	Ki... Kitty...
C14_EV6070_00075_GIRL	Mummy!
C14_EV6070_00080_FIXR	What!?
C14_EV6070_00090_BET5	You didn't cry while I was gone, did you?
C14_EV6070_00100_BET5	You all seem to be having a good time.
C14_EV6070_00110_BET5	Awfully rude of you not to invite me,\ndon't you think? 
C14_EV6070_00120_BET6	Women of our caliber\ndon't need invitations, darling.
C14_EV6070_00130_BET6	Right?
C14_EV6070_00140_FIXR	What are you doing here?\nI destroyed you and your worlds long ago!
C14_EV6070_00150_FIXR	It is not possible! Are phenomena once\naffirmed... now changing?
C14_EV6070_00160_BET6	It looks like only the three of us\nmade it this far...
C14_EV6070_00170_BET6	...oh, and the young lady of course.
C14_EV6070_00180_BET5	That's enough, yes?\nTo prove "phenomenal affirmation"\nisn't absolute after all.
C14_EV6070_00190_BET5	All right, lady killer.\nJust try to predict what the lot of us\nwill do next!
C14_EV6080_00010_FIXR	I told you your struggle was pointless.
C14_EV6080_00020_FIXR	No matter how many of you defy me,\nyou are no more than twigs\nscratching at the sky.
C14_EV6080_00025_FIXR	Cheshire!
C14_EV6080_00040_FIXR	Now do you see?
C14_EV6080_00050_FIXR	Only I can determine the truth of this world,\nand none among you can shake it!
C14_EV6080_00060_BAYO	It should be obvious that I'm no twig.
C14_EV6080_00070_BAYO	You still don't realize\njust how stubborn I am, do you?
C14_EV6080_00075_BAYO	No matter how many of me there are,\nthat doesn't change.
C14_EV6080_00080_BAYO	That's my unshakeable truth!
C14_EV6080_00090_FIXR	Very well.
C14_EV6080_00100_FIXR	Then I suppose I'll simply erase you all, \nand your so-called truth.
C14_EV6080_00110_FIXR	Here,  and in this very instant!
C14_EV6080_00120_GIRL	Did they... combine?
C14_EV6080_00130_FIXR	What... what is happening?
C14_EV6080_00140_FIXR	I've never seen anything like this!
C14_EV6080_00150_BAFU	Perhaps you're not a visual learner.
C14_EV6080_00160_BAYO	I'll teach you the hard way!
C14_EV6090_00020_FIXR	Ha ha ha ha ha ha...\nHahahahahahahahaha!
C14_EV6090_00030_LUKA	Ah shit!
C14_EV6090_00040_LUKA	Stop, stop, stop!
C14_EV6090_00050_LUKA	D'oh!
C14_EV6090_00060_GIRL	Lu... ka?
C14_EV6090_00070_LUKA	Sorry to keep you ladies waiting.
C14_EV6090_00080_LUKA	It was a bit hard to find you\nwith all the rubble.
C14_EV6090_00090_FIXR	Arch-Adam?
C14_EV6090_00100_FIXR	How?\nHow is it that you exist here and now?
C14_EV6090_00110_BAYO	You never cease to amuse me, Luka.
C14_EV6090_00120_BAYO	I could imagine worse men\nto spend my last moments with.
C14_EV6090_00130_LUKA	Hey, you're the only one I want by my side.
C14_EV6090_00140_BAYO	We've got to keep her safe...
C14_EV6090_00150_LUKA	I know.\nShe's the one who's going to keep\nour truth alive.
C14_EV6100_00010_FIXR	This... is unfathomable!
C14_EV6100_00020_FIXR	My phenomena... immutable truth...\nchallenged and denied!
C14_EV6100_00030_LUKA	When you fight for what you believe,\nyou can change anything.
C14_EV6100_00040_LUKA	Bayo... Bayonetta?
C14_EV6100_00050_BAYO	Luka...
C14_EV6100_00060_BAYO	Luka... is that you?
C14_EV6100_00070_BAYO	I can't see anything... \ncan't hear anything...
C14_EV6100_00080_LUKA	I'm right here!
C14_EV6100_00090_BAYO	Is she...?
C14_EV6100_00100_LUKA	She's okay.\nSeems like we always find each other\nwhenever she needs us...
C14_EV6100_00110_BAYO	...and we've already come so far.
C14_EV6100_00120_LUKA	Fate brought us here together,\nand it will never tear us apart.
C14_EV6100_00130_LUKA	We'll always be together, Cereza.
C14_EV6100_00140_BAYO	No Luka... we've always been together.
C14_EV6100_00150_BAYO	My clumsy, lovely fool...
C14_EV6100_00155_BAYO	...who'll forever be in my heart.
C14_EV6100_00160_GIRL	Daddy...
C14_EV6100_00170_GIRL	Mummy!
C14_EV6110_00010_GIRL	What the hell is this?
C14_EV6110_00020_ALPH	Ty...
C14_EV6110_00030_ALPH	Kit... ty...
C14_EV6110_00040_GIRL	Wait, are you....
C14_EV6110_00050_GIRL	No... you're just the darkness\nArch-Eve left behind! 
C14_EV6110_00060_ALPH	Your end has come...
C14_EV6110_00070_ALPH	Kit... ty!
C14_EV6110_00080_GIRL	There's only one person allowed\nto call me that!
C14_EV6110_00090_GIRL	Hang on, rewind.
C14_EV6110_00100_GIRL	My name is Viola.\nAnd you’re never gonna fucking forget it!
C14_EV6120_00010_GIRL	Need a little help here, daddy!
C14_EV6130_00010_BAYO	Do it.\nYou must, if you want to prove yourself.
C14_EV6130_00020_BAYO	That was your last lesson, Viola.
C14_EV6130_00030_BAYO	But, for someone who's grown so much, \nperhaps the gift of a new name is in order.
C14_EV6130_00040_GIRL	Thanks, mummy...\nI'll treasure it, always.
CHAPTER/chapter14_ta
C14_TA0010_00010_BAYO	The destruction has stopped...\nWhy?
C14_TA0010_00020_BAYO	Is that...
C14_TA0100_00010_FIXB	Come now, you can do better than that.
C14_TA0200_00010_FIXR	You were an unexpected variable... \nbut my phenomenal affirmation is absolute.
C14_TA0610_00010_BAYO	What's wrong?\nHaving... trouble... running the numbers?
C14_TA0620_00010_BAYO	Well... don't... count me out... just yet.
C14_TA0630_00010_BAYO	I'll... be the one...\nWho decides... what the truth will be.
C14_TA0650_00010_BAYO	That's not a bad look for you.\nIn fact, I might even prefer it to the usual.
C14_TA0650_00020_WOLF	Flattery will get you everywhere.
C14_TA0650_00030_WOLF	But hey, this is just a natural evolution\nof my rugged good looks.
C14_TA0650_00040_BAYO	How could anyone resist?\nNow let's focus on the task at hand!
C14_TA0650_00050_WOLF	Right.\nLet's see this fight through to the end,\nand make sure our truth lives on!

ECOM_EV0000_00000_NARR	
ECOM_EV0000_00010_NARR	When I was a kid, my father\nused to tell me something.
ECOM_EV0000_00020_NARR	"There are no forks in the road of life."
ECOM_EV0000_00030_NARR	"You just walk along, feeling your way\nthrough the grass, and leaving a faint path\nbehind."
ECOM_EV0000_00040_NARR	"But if you turn around to look, you may get\nthe strange feeling you've walked that path\nbefore—"
ECOM_EV0000_00050_NARR	"—or that someone was walking along\nwith you, lending you the strength\nto press on."
ECOM_EV0000_00060_NARR	I'd always believed there was only one truth.\nBut—
ECOM_EV0000_00070_NARR	What if some other version of me on a\ndistant world was searching for all\npossibilities?
ECOM_EV0000_00080_NARR	And what if, when all the possibilites were\noverlaid, the path that stood out the\nclearest was the real truth?
ECOM_EV6060_00010_FIXR	Let's end this now.
ECOM_EV6060_00020_BET0	I'm not done... yet...

ECOM_EV0020_00040_ENZO	Whassa matter, your glasses dirty?\nNot a cloud in the sky, perfect day\nfor a ballgame.
ECOM_EV0020_00050_ENZO	And y'know what that means, right?
ECOM_EV0020_00060_ENZO	It means you found a way to drag me all\nover the city, and turn my opening day\nticket into toilet paper!
ECOM_EV0020_00070_ENZO	Don't act like you don't hear me talkin'!
ECOM_EV0020_00080_ENZO	You know how much shit\nI had to go through for this thing?

ECOM_EV0020_00130_BAYO	But don't forget, it was you who agreed to\ndo anything I asked in exchange for that job.
ECOM_EV0020_00140_ENZO	Just 'cause I said anything doesn't mean—

ECOM_EV0020_00720_RODN	Then here's a friendly hello.
ECOM_EV0020_00730_RODN	Definitely not a regular...
ECOM_EV0020_00740_BAYO	I do hope you haven't forgotten my order.
ECOM_EV0020_00750_RODN	It's in the truck, ready to go.
ECOM_EV0020_00760_BAYO	You know, I really love New York.\nBut ill-behaved tourists can be quite a pain!
ECOM_EV0030_00005_BAYO	More cheap toys.
ECOM_EV0030_00010_RODN	Gettin' a little too hot in the kitchen?
ECOM_EV0030_00020_BAYO	Just give me my order before I lose my cool.
ECOM_EV0030_00025_RODN	Order up!
ECOM_EV0030_00030_RODN	Beautiful.
ECOM_EV0030_00040_RODN	Just hope you can keep up.\nSeems like these guys are built different\nthan usual.
ECOM_EV0030_00050_BAYO	More new faces, I see.\nThen perhaps a bit of fancy dress\nis in order. 
ECOM_EV0035_00005_BAYO	What's that...?
ECOM_EV0035_00010_BAYO	Size isn't everything, you know.
ECOM_EV0040_00020_RODN	That thing ain't from Paradiso.\nNo sanctified seasoning means no deal.
ECOM_EV0040_00030_RODN	Better think fast, Bayonetta.
ECOM_EV0040_00040_RODN	Storm's a lot worse than I thought.
ECOM_EV0040_00050_RODN	Well, I'll be damned if it ain't\nthe Demon Slave.
ECOM_EV0040_00060_RODN	That's one ancient art\nI thought was lost for good.
ECOM_EV0050_00010_BAYO	What... are they?
ECOM_EV0050_00020_BAYO	Jeanne!
ECOM_EV0050_00030_JANN	We'll catch up later!

ECOM_EV0060_00005_BAYO	Jeanne!
ECOM_EV0060_00010_BAYO	Jeanne!
ECOM_EV0060_00020_BAYO	Finally decided to come up for air, did you?\nNow... who invited you to our little cruise?
ECOM_EV0070_00005_BAYO	Jeanne!
ECOM_EV0070_00010_BAYO	Playing the good Samaritan, Rodin?\nHow dreadfully noble.
ECOM_EV0070_00020_RODN	We gotta talk.
ECOM_EV0070_00030_RODN	Preferably some place a little quieter.
ECOM_EV2000_00010_JANN	Damn Homunculi beat me to the punch.\nLucky for them I'm not looking for a fight...
ECOM_EV2000_00020_JANN	While they hammer on the front door,\nI'll make my way in from above.
ECOM_EV2010_00010_JANN	Seems the hotline has been disconnected...\nThis base is no mere tax toilet.
ECOM_EV2010_00020_JANN	All right, then.\nI'll take care of these bastards myself!
ECOM_EV4010_00010_JANN	Dr. Sigurd...\nA pleasure to finally meet you.
ECOM_EV5000_00010_DOCT	Who... are you?
ECOM_EV5000_00020_JANN	Do you know a girl named Viola?\nShe sent me to find you.
ECOM_EV5000_00030_DOCT	I know no Viola...\nBut I believe I know why you're here.
ECOM_EV5000_00040_DOCT	...You're looking for a way to the Alphaverse.
ECOM_EV5000_00050_JANN	Very astute, doctor.
ECOM_EV5000_00060_DOCT	As it appears you and I share a purpose,\nI'll gladly assist you in any way I can.
ECOM_EV5000_00070_DOCT	On one condition...
ECOM_EV5000_00080_JANN	Condition?
ECOM_EV5000_00090_DOCT	It's been so long since I 've had\na good conversation.
ECOM_EV5000_00100_JANN	I believe that can be arranged.\nAfter all, we have a long and eventful\njourney ahead of us.
ECOM_EV5000_00110_DOCT	It seems we had best hurry.\nFollow me.
ECOM_EV5000_00120_JANN	This should be useful, but...
ECOM_EV5000_00130_DOCT	Shall we?\nI'll leave the driving to you, of course.
ECOM_EV5000_00140_JANN	Full throttle it is then, doctor.
ECOM_EV5010_00010_JANN	I think you'll find this ride\nmuch smoother than the last.

ECOM_EV7000_00100_RODN	You know, I'm the one who has to hear it\nfrom your pops when you decide to turn\nmy place into study hall.
ECOM_EV7000_00110_GIRL	School's closed today.\nIt is, seriously!
ECOM_EV7000_00120_GIRL	So anyway, got anything good for me?\nSomething where I can let off some steam?

CHAPTER/common
COMN_CROW01_00020_BAYO	That was a bit of a workout!
COMN_CROW02_00030_BAYO	Trying to lead me on?
COMN_CROW01_00120_GIRL	Good race, but I beat you!
COMN_CROW02_00130_GIRL	That was a little harder than I thought.
COMN_CAT01_00020_BAYO	What an adorable new friend.
COMN_CAT02_00030_BAYO	Settle down now, little one.
COMN_CAT02_00120_GIRL	Cute and really, really... feisty!
COMN_CAT03_00130_GIRL	Witches and black cats,\nthe ultimate team-up!
COMN_FROG01_00020_BAYO	Having an outdoor recital?
COMN_FROG03_00040_BAYO	You're an energetic little thing!
COMN_FROG02_00120_GIRL	Rehearsal's over for now, got it?
COMN_FROG03_00130_GIRL	You're uh, kind of moist huh...
COMN_CLOCK01_00010_BAYO	Let's see what time has to teach.
COMN_RT0010_00090_NARR	I barely understood what he was saying,\nbut for some reason it really resonated\nwith me.
COMN_RT0010_00100_NARR	And every time I though about it,\nI looked up at the sky and daydreamed.
COMN_RT0010_00110_NARR	What if somewhere, some version of me\nwas walking along through the grass\njust like me?
COMN_RT0010_00120_NARR	Could we be following the same path,\ntaking the same journey?
COMN_RT0010_00130_NARR	That idea had its hooks in me\nmore powerfully than any anime\nor sci-fi novel.
COMN_RT0010_00140_NARR	And even after growing up,\nI still believed it could be true.
COMN_RT0010_00150_NARR	I just knew that someday, a version\nof my father from some other world\nwould appear,
COMN_RT0010_00160_NARR	and pull out a strawberry candy\njust for me, like he always used to.
COMN_RT0010_00170_NARR	But the visitor from another world\nthat appeared to me...
COMN_RT0010_00180_NARR	...was a nightmare that had come\nto crush all hope like blades of grass\nbeneath his heel.
COMN_PR0010_00010_JANN	A demon, here?
COMN_PR0010_00020_JANN	And it's clearly been summoned!
COMN_PR0010_00030_JANN	Who else could possibly have...
COMN_PR0010_00040_BAYO	Perhaps our new friends can tell us a thing\nor two.
COMN_SP1010_00010_JANN	The whole facility is overrun...
COMN_SP1010_00020_JANN	But from the looks of this equipment,\nit appears the doctor knew just what\nto expect.
COMN_SP1020_00010_JANN	I hope this Dr. Sigurd managed to keep\nout of trouble...
COMN_SP2010_00010_NARR	This one man is supposed to be our savior?
COMN_SP2010_00020_NARR	It's not that simple.\n... Although you know what? Maybe it is.
COMN_SP2010_00030_NARR	Back home, research into parallel worlds\nwas pretty advanced, and before long,\nwe proved they existed.
COMN_SP2010_00040_NARR	We figured out how to contact them,\nthen got in touch with a top secret \norganization here.
COMN_SP2010_00050_NARR	And with Dr. Sigurd, the head\nof the organization, we found out\nabout Chaos Gears.
COMN_SP2010_00060_NARR	With his help, we can use the Chaos Gears\nto break into the Alphaverse.
COMN_SP2010_00065_NARR	That's why...
COMN_SP2010_00070_NARR	That's why you made the trip here.
COMN_SP2010_00080_NARR	What exactly do you need him to do?
COMN_SP2010_00090_NARR	And why do you put so much faith in him?
COMN_SP2010_00100_NARR	Well, he and Singularity are...
COMN_SP3010_00010_JANN	He must be up ahead.\nI just hope he's still breathing.
COMN_SP4010_00010_JANN	Didn't think we'd get any privacy.
COMN_SP4010_00020_DOCT	This path leads outside.\nThere's a shutter at the exit,\nso if we can just make it there...
COMN_SP4020_00010_JANN	Persistent creatures, aren't they!\nIt looks like I'm not the only one after you.
COMN_SP4020_00020_DOCT	That's precisely why I hid in a\nsecured location. I can't allow myself\nto be captured by them.
COMN_SP4020_00030_DOCT	It's regrettable, but I'll just have to\nconsider the facility a parting gift.
COMN_SP4020_00040_DOCT	I've even prepared an explosive farewell.
COMN_SP4025_00010_DOCT	Ready, my dear?
COMN_SP4025_00020_JANN	I love a good show.\nJust say the word.
COMN_SP4025_00030_DOCT	Very well then...
COMN_SP4030_00010_DOCT	It appears that someone\ndidn't enjoy the fireworks.
COMN_SP4030_00020_JANN	Then I'll show them what the Umbra\ncan really do!
COMN_SP4040_00010_JANN	Just a little more!
COMN_SP4110_00010_DOCT	I'm afraid I still don't know your name,\nmy brave friend.
COMN_SP4110_00020_JANN	Call me Jeanne.
COMN_SP4110_00030_DOCT	A pleasure, Jeanne.
COMN_SP4110_00040_DOCT	So, where do we go from here?
COMN_SP4110_00050_JANN	I have someone I'd like you to meet.\nThat is why I took this little trip, after all.
COMN_TA0610_00010_BET0	What's wrong?\nHaving... trouble... running the numbers?
COMN_TA0620_00010_BET0	Well... don't... count me out... just yet.
COMN_TA0630_00010_BET0	I'll... be the one...\nWho decides... what the truth will be.
COMN_TA1200_00010_FSOL	Unbelievable...\nIs this... the end of the world?
COMN_TA1300_00010_FSOL	We can't give up.\nIf you're still breathing, follow me!
COMN_TA1400_00010_FSOL	Keep your eyes on the sky.\nThere's no telling when they'll attack.
COMN_TA1300_00020_FSOL	Stay close! Eyes on all sides!\nIf one of those things touches you,\nyou're dead!
COMN_TA9000_00010_RODN	Heh heh heh...
COMN_TA9000_00030_RODN	What the hell... been a while since you and I\nthrew down. But real talk, I've been waiting\nfor this for ages.
COMN_TA9000_00040_RODN	You ready?\nLet's do this!
COMN_TA9100_00010_RODN	Shiiett...
COMN_TA9100_00020_RODN	Where'd that come from?
COMN_TA9100_00030_RODN	Credit where credit is due,\nyou just put your foot straight up my ass. 
COMN_TA9100_00040_RODN	You won this time, but remember—\nthe devil always gets his due. 
COMN_TA9900_00010_NARR	Never hurts to review the basics\nof breakin' heads.
COMN_TA9900_00020_NARR	I would say "go wild,"\nbut you take that shit too literally.
COMN_TA9900_00030_NARR	Just don't fuck the place up too bad, aight?

CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_01	The most basic type of the Homunculus artificial lifeform, created by Singularity through advanced application of nanomachine technology and capable of replicating any and all human body parts and organs. \n\nThe Stratus type can also fuse together to form various other types of Homunculi.\n\nPossessed of no intelligence to speak of, they are incapable of acting autonomously and are controlled mentally by Singularity, and the ribbons of light that extend upward from their bodies are bundles of neural fibers that act as telepathic receivers.\n\nIn addition to being several times more agile than the average human, they can also liquify their bodies and transform their arms and hands into various weapons.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_02	An enhanced Stratus type that has been given flight capabilities for assault, greatly increasing its operational parameters.\n\nThe enhanced musculature it has to aid with flight stabilization has also increased its overall size, and it has been given improved attack capabilities such as the ability to instantly deploy and attack with a specially designed spear.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_03	An amalgamation of several Stratus-type Homunculi that has reconfigured itself for long range attack.\n\nIt can increase its metabolism to perform cellular fission at an extreme rate, and convert the energy into a highly damaging laser.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_04	A Cavum variant with a unique mutation that has changed the shape of its barrel.\n\nIts laser energy output has also increased, and it is able to fire the energy from its mutated barrel in a scattered blast.\n\nWhile this mutation was not intended by Singularity, he recognized its noteworthy usefulness in battle and affirmed the phenomenon as a new type of Homunculus.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_05	A Homunculus type that flies using its enlarged hands like wings, and has become specialized for aerial activity.\n\nIt excels at long-range attacks from high altitude and diving tackle attacks using its own sturdy form.\n\nWhile it moves relatively slowly, it has the strange ability to release large floating "hands" that automatically track and bind targets, allowing it to dispatch them at will.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_06	A parasitic Homunculus type that has the ability to attach itself to organisms and assume mental and physical control.\n\nWhile not much of a threat on its own, it is able to draw power out of a host that exceeds its normal limits, turning even a fairly normal human into the equal of a musclebound soldier.\n\nThe host's nervous system becomes completely overrun and all self-awareness is lost as they are forced to fight until their bodies fall apart.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_07	A Homunculus type designed for enhanced speed, with a lightweight body and highly developed leg musculature.\n\nIt is able to predict enemy patterns by observing muscle movement and evades with amazing speed when it senses danger, making it all but impossible to attack with a lumbering Infernal Demon.\n\nBecause its musculature has been reduced to the bare minimum to make it as lightweight as possible, it has low attack power and most often acts in groups to cover this weakness.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_08	A Homunculus type composed of a large number of Stratus types fused together to create a massive and highly reslient body.\n\nIt dominates opponenets with melee combat, and was used soon after creation to lead extermination squads, methodically destroying and murdering.\n\nAlthough it is slow and is unable to make precise movements, its hefty body allows it to lumber along unfazed by most attacks, and it pushes through while sweeping its sword-like left arm through its prey.\n\nBecause it is not under any direct control from Singularity the fusion between the Stratus types that compose it is weak, and a sufficiently strong impact will cause its body to break apart.\n\nHowever, it can also utilize that weak connection to act in unexpected ways, such as liquefying itself to engulf targets.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_09	A variant of the Floccus Homunculus type fitted with a large blunt weapon as its left arm.\n\nThe Fractus type can separate a portion of its left arm and swing it like a flail, giving it both greater power and longer range than the Floccus type.\n\nIt also has the ability to deploy an energy shield and cover the weaknesses seen in the Floccus type.\n
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_10	An explosive Homunculus type that resembles a jellyfish and can float in midair.\n\nIt splits apart upon being attacked, and when it can no longer split it self destructs, dealing heavy damage to the surrounding area.\n\nDesigned as a bioweapon that is not only unconcerned with its own survival but actively invites attack in an attempt to destroy targets along with itself, it is mainly sent into battle against large enemies like Infernal Demons.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_11	An enhanced variant of the Pannus type Homunculus.\n\nUnlike the Pannus type, it aggressively attacks targets and uses its splitting ability to create unique formations and deliver high-speed blunt attacks.\n\nIt utilizes several varieties of formations and switches between them skillfully to vex its prey.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_12	A large, mollusk-like Homunculus type.\n\nProtected all over by an extremely durable iridescent exoskeleton, it boasts extremely high defense against external attacks.\n\nIt possesses a pair of tentacles that end in hardened tips like sharp axes, which it wields to slash at enemies.\n\nIt can also concentrate its own lifeforce and fire an extremely powerful laser, but in order to do so it must split and open its exoskeleton, exposing its body and leaving it vulnerable. Also, while its thick shell provides protection even from the savage blows of Infernal Demons, it is not airtight and is vulnerable to attacks like poisonous liquid.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_13	A gigantic bipedal humanoid Homunculus type.\n\nWhile of a seemingly excessive size, it is adept at ground-based combat and uses its strength and levitation abilities to move with agility.\n\nIt has both the offensive and defensive strength to take on Infernal Demons, as well as a variety of both physical and energy attacks that allow it to attack at any range.\n\nIt can also operate autonomously, and if Singularity's control is broken by an enemy attack, it will temporarily shift into an "assault mode," splitting its two arms into four and utilizing increasingly vicious attacks in an attempt to remove any immediate danger to itself.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_14	A giant, quadrupedal beast-like Homunculus type.\n\nIts main weapon is its head, covered in thick armor and sporting sharp horns, which it levels at enemies while charging at them ferociously. The power behind that charge is astounding, capable of toppling and trampling even the largest Infernal Demons, and facing it head on is not an advisable strategy.\n\nThat same power gives it an agility that would seem impossible for its size, and it is capable of not only jumping much higher than its own height, but also of running along walls, making it a vertical terror as well.\n\nThe key to stopping this beast lies in robbing it of its speed.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_15	An enhanced version of the Asperatus type Homunculus.\n\nIn addition to its inherent viciousness, it has also been given the ability to emit flames from its hooves that deal additional damage to its targets.\n\nLike Asperatus, it uses charging tackles as its main method of attack, and also leaves a sea of flames in its wake.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_16	A Homunculus type created for enemy surveillance and analyzing military progress.\n\nWhile it resembles a towering pillar, the majority of the pillar is simply a support for the main section situated at the top and out of harm's way.\n\nThe pillar portion is composed of stacked segments which can be destroyed to bring down the main section, but each pillar segment can defend itself with abilities like producing Stratus type Homunculi and creating defensive barriers, making it a challenge to destroy.\n\nThe main section can also grow legs and move independently if the pillar is completely destroyed, and can attack by throwing the ring-shaped weapon on its back like a boomerang.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_17	An enhanced variant of the Castellanus type Homunculus.\n\nIn addition to its enemy surveillance capabilities, it also has the unique ability to create dimensional distortions and mask the presence of other nearby Homunculi for defensive purposes.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_18	A Homunculus type created for subterranean covert actions.\n\nLike a mole, it hides underground and approaches silently, its preferred method of attack being a surprise attack from underfoot.\n\nIt can move swiftly through the ground using its enlarged arms to dig, confusing enemies as it appears and reappears seemingly at random, but when it periodically pops up to reobtain its target's position, it can be attacked and dragged above ground.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_19	A variant of the Tuba type Homunculus, adjusted to operate above ground and be more aggressive.\n\nShunning covert attacks for frontal assaults, it moves nimbly above ground using charging attacks and even jumping dive attacks, zeroing in on enemies with a varied fighting style.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_20	A gigantic Homunculus type with a segmented body.\n\nWith heads at both ends of its body, it is difficult to discern the front from the back. Using that to its advantage, it tracks targets with both heads, quickly changing direction as necessary to pursue.\n\nThe multiple legs that support its heavy body cause damage simply by moving, and also have powerful suction cups that allow the giant creature to even walk on walls.\n\nAside from its raw power, it can also attack by firing blades of light from its legs, breathing fire, and even shooting Stratus types like missiles from its back, making it difficult to approach let alone defeat.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_21	A giant, living warship Homunculus type composed of countless Stratus type Homunculi fused together.\n\nIts durability is unparalleled, with most attacks having no effect.\n\nIn addition to attacking with laser fire as it flies, it can also deploy a wide variety of Homunculi for ground assault.\n\nAside from its role as an attack vessel, it also serves as a telepathic relay, and the bundles of neural fibers that extend from its hull send and receive orders, making it possible for Singularity to extend his control over numerous Homunculi within a wide range.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_22	An extremely unique Homunculus type with the ability to control time.\n\nCreated and imbued with a portion of Singularity's own power, it can control manipulate the flow of time within a specified area, rewinding or fast forwarding it like a movie.\n\nIt is believed that Singularity uses this Homunculus when invading and destroying strategically important points to lock the events in time, preventing his enemies from interfering.\n\nThis time manipulation ability is also effective against living things, and anything caught in range risks being locked in an eternal prison.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_23	A Homunculus type created to produce other Homunculi.\n\nIt has no method of attack, and merely takes root like a plant using materials and energy it absorbs to continuously produce Stratus type Homunculi.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_24	A stationary Homunculus type that is placed in designated areas and produces poisonous gas.\n\nThe gas that it creates internally has no effect on Homunculi, and by spreading it over a wide area it causes damage to enemies and suppresses the area in which it has been deployed.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_25	A Homunculus type created to generate barriers that impede enemies and defend other Homunculi.\n\nUnable to move, it is usually deployed in groups that cooperate to form a barrier around a specific area.\n\nThese powerful barriers keep out both physical and spiritual matter, and are vital in blocking enemy progress and defending important bases.\n\nLinked Humilis types also share vitality, and if only one of a group is defeated, it will soon be revived. As a result, a group of Humilis types can only be defeated if they are all destroyed at the same time.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_26	A massive, shark-like Homunculus type that flies as if swimming.\n\nAlthough it looks almost elegant as it twists its body in the air, it scatters clouds of erasure from above as it goes, spreading destruction over a wide area.\n\nThe cloud that covers its head can also create dimensional pockets in the spaces between the atoms of matter it touches, allowing Iridescent to phase through even the most durable substances like air.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_27	A humanoid terminal created within Iridescent's body by Singularity to allow him to assume direct control.\n\nIn order to expel foreign bodies, it possesses a number of offensive capabilities, such as the ability to generate extreme winds and adhesive fluids to trap targets.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_28	A giant, misshapen version of Iridescent, created after it took heavy damage and reconstructed itself using the magic power gained from the Arch-Eve it absorbed.\n\nIn addition to the incalculable destructive power it gained by growing arms and legs, it has also gained the ability to split its tail in two and use it like a railgun to fire massive projectiles of unimaginable destructive power.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_29	A gigantic humanoid Homunculus based on the Cumulonimbus type, with defensive and resistance capabilities that are fully adaptable to the location in which it is deployed.\n\nAs a result of being deployed to a volcanic region, it has gained both resistance to extreme heat and the ability to cloak itself in flame for increased offensive potential.\n\nIt can also influence its environment, creating what would under other circumstances be considered natural disasters, and can cause lava to erupt by slamming the ground.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_30	An evolved form of Pyrocumulus that has absorbed an Arch-Eve's magic power and gained new abilities.\n\nIt can use a portion of its body to create a flight platform that gives it aerial mobility, as well as an enhanced ability to produce Stratus-type Homunculi within its own body, which it uses to create clones of itself. \n\nBy creating a group of multiple clones at once, it then confuses enemies and becomes an even greater threat.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_31	An unusual, massive Homunculus type designed by Singularity with the intent to replicate gods worshipped by ancient civilizations.\n\nIts appearance is a far cry from any naturally occuring lifeform, with a lizard-like torso and humanoid upper body, and one of its arms is a tentacle that ends in something resembling a dragon's head.\n\nCreated along with Cirrocumulus, its basic capabiities are the same but it also has the ability to deliver powerful electric attacks, mimicking the "divine judgement" spoken of long ago.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_32	Like Cirrostratus, Cirrocumulus is also a massive Homunculus type designed by Singularity with the intent to replicate gods worshipped by ancient civilizations.\n\nWhile sharing basic properties with Cirrostratus, this Homunculus is equipped with a complementary ability to generate and attack with extreme winds, bringing the divine retribution feared by ancients.\n\nCirrocumulus and Cirrostratus are designed to operate and attack in tandem, and the structure shaped like a giant set of scales that they use as a combat arena is thought to be inspired by the Egyptian Book of the Dead.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_33	This colossal Homunculus type was created after the completion of Cirrocumulus and Cirrostratus as an advancement of Singularity's concept of replicating divinity, and with the application of ideas he found in ancient texts.\n\nUnlike the majority of other Homunculi which are modeled after existing lifeforms and with an emphasis on functionality, Stratocumulus is designed almost entirely around Singularity's design sensiblities and image of what a malevolent god should be.\n\nStratocumulus' design specs include both the Cirrostratus and Cirrocumulus cores, and their fusion and absorption of an Arch-Eve's energy are the key to its activation.\n\nStratocumulus' four tentacle-like arms end in serpent's heads that not only bite into prey, but can also spit fire and emit lasers, allowing it to attack at all ranges. It also has energy cores in its head and abdomen that would at first appear to be vulnerable, but it can shield one of the cores with a powerful barrier, adapting to attacks as needed.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_34	A form that Singularity has assumed to do battle, using the sum of the energy absorbed from the systematic destruction of parallel worlds within the Multiverse to increase his attack power to the limit.\n\nSwollen beyond recognition with the power of the World of Chaos, he resembles something like a writhing mountain.\n\nWith the destructive power granted by this enormous body, he can level entire cities effortlessly.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_35	A more perfect form that Singularity designed and created following his initial battle with Bayonetta, gained by attaining control over the chaotic energy surging within. \n\nWith a humanoid body as the base, this form is wrapped in a device used to harness and convert energy, worn like a powered suit. He is also equipped with a "smart scroll" terminal on his back that contains Homunculus design information and can be used to summon them at will.\n\nThis incarnation of Singularity could be considered the pinnacle of human technological advancement, with abilities that far exceed all other human knowledge.
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_36	The perfect form of Singularity, attained by purging himself of all impurities and unnecessary information to become one with the chaotic energy of the Multiverse.\n\nHaving become what could be considered the universe itself, he has gained control over reality, making opposition meaningless. In addition to replicating and manipulating portions of worlds he has conquered, he can also access the memories of the Arch-Eves of those worlds and create projections with comparable power.\n\nIf there is any force capable of surpassing this form of Singularity, it may only be that of a unique universal will with the ability to overturn phenomena once thought indisputable.\n 
CORE_HOMUN_DETAIL_37	A stationary Homunculus type that reacts to approaching entities and attacks.\n\nOften deployed to defend vulnerable areas especially gigantic Homunculi, it attacks nearby enemies with laser blasts.\n\nWhile it can't move from its position, it can hide beneath the surface to later appear and attack instantly when an enemy is detected.

CORE_BOSS_DETAIL_02	A tragic symbol and former counterpart of Luka who lived in the Alphaverse until being overtaken by malicious forces.\n\nOnce a soldier fighting to stop Singularity's plans for domination, he fell in battle and his body was destroyed—but his consciousness survived.\n\nIntent on getting revenge, he called out to other counterparts throughout the Multiverse but his thirst for vengeance drew only malevolence, and he was transformed into a thing of hate, his former emotions now gone.\n\nDark Adam's call of "the single truth" troubled Luka for years, eventually drawing him to Thule where Dark Adam was able to merge with Luka's body, which had just gained the power of the faerie.\n\nDark Adam could be thought of as the polar opposite to Lukaon, with both of them vying for Luka, the Arch-Adam Origin, and imparting their own darkness and light.
CORE_BOSS_DETAIL_03	The shadow of what was once a counterpart of Bayonetta.\n\nOnce a resident of the Alphaverse, the world where Singularity was born, she was also that world's Arch-Eve. Working together with its Arch-Adam, she fought to stop Singularity but was utterly defeated and her body was destroyed.\n\nShe managed to barely survive as a residual consciousness, but as Singularity continued to erase more and more parallel worlds, the consciousnesses of those world's Arch-Eve's flowed into the Alphaverse where they merged and became Dark Eve.\n\nHer body is composed of those swarming, warped hearts and no longer possessed of any clear awareness, acting solely on an impulse to destroy.\n\nHer existence is masked even to Singularity's eye, and she simply roams the Multiverse, attacking everything she comes across.

CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_01	A demon taking the form of a woman who left this world under unfortunate circumstances, only to be reincarnated in hell.\n\nCounter to her beautiful, swallowtail butterfly-like appearance, this demon is particularly brutal, and her reputation is well known even among the denizens of Inferno. \n \nIf a conjurer were to trade her soul to enter into a contract with Madama Butterfly, the demon would impart upon her enormous power and great wisdom. Furthermore, a select few truly powerful witches can use the ancient art of the "Demon Slave" to control her power themselves.\n\nIt appears that there is a bond between Bayonetta and Madama Butterfly that goes beyond the terms of their contract, but it is unknown how that contract came to be.
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_91	Madama Butterfly's true form, obtained by being anointed in the magic-rich heart's blood of Bayonetta through her use of the forbidden "Deadly Sin" ritual.\n\nGrowing to a size that pierces the clouds, she has become even more beautiful and even more brutal, leading all who gaze upon her to feel their sanity crumble as something akin to a yearning for death begins to grow within.
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_02	A monstrous, dragon-like creature that lives in the forests of Inferno, it is incredibly fierce, viewing all that moves as prey and devouring it. \n\nTerritorial, it is most likely to be found alone.\n\nRelatively easy to handle if given angel flesh to chew on, Bayonetta summons it frequently, but anyone  unaccustomed to the required magic is likely to get themselves swallowed instead, body and soul.
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_92	Gomorrah's completely uninhibited form, pushed to the limits of its power by Bayonetta during the "Deadly Sin" ritual.\n\nThis form resembles the legendary "Beast Tyrant" spoken of in forbidden tomes, a mountainous creature rumored to live deep within the Johnson Forest of Inferno.\n\nThis Beast Tyrant was said to rule over all of the Gomorrah in Johnson Forest, and could make all of the demons in the forest bow simply by raising its head, but not even the residents of Inferno have managed to see it and live to tell the tale.
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_03	An Infernal Demon that nests upon a sea of magma deep within the furthest reaches of Inferno.\n\nRarely seen on the surface, even in hell sightings of the demon are a rare event, which led the residents of Inferno to give it the name Phantasmaraneae, meaning "phantom spider."\n\nWhile having the frightening appearance of a gigantic spider, it is a relatively good-natured beast, and should one have the good fortune to encounter Phantasmaraneae, it should be treated with care and respect in hopes of receiving rare treasures and secrets in return.\n\nHowever, should you anger it, you will be melted instantly by an indignantly spewed burst of magma.
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_93	Phantasmaraneae's ultimate form, unleashed by Bayonetta's "Deadly Sin" ritual, now with an out of control internal reactor that continously creates magma at a temperature of one trillion degrees.\n\nThe flames that cloak its body and the sheer heat from the magma are powerful enough to vaporize nearly anything in the vicinity.\n\nIn this state, Phantasmaraneae itself has no way to cool down, and must simply fight until time runs out and it explodes into nothingness.
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_04	The ruler of dark skies, with wings large enough to block out the sun and covered in iron scales.\n\nEver curious, Malphas continually observes not only Inferno but the human world as well, and has filled itself with all their knowledge and mysteries. \n\nIt also likes to preen, and decorates itself with gems and jewelry in the manner of human nobility.\n\nHowever, this same curiosity has as another facet of stark cruelty, and the bird immediately tears those it encounters to shreds with its sharp beak and razor-like talons.
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_05	On rare occasions, animals that somehow wander into Inferno and manage to survive the deadly environment can take on monstrous forms.\n\nInfernal Demons of this type are known as "Labolas," and their ferocity is known to strike fear in even the most powerful demons in Inferno, but there are also cases where multiple animals will fuse together to gain even greater magic power.\n\nNotably, the Labolas that Bayonetta has entered into a pact with is a rare example—a family of five cats that, even after their transformation and fusion, each retain their own consciousness and can split apart to act independently.\n\nThe freezing breath this Labolas spews is rumored to be a manifestation of the chilling fear it experienced during the long path to its transformation.
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_06	A member of the royal family that rules over a certain region of Inferno.\n\nPreferring not to be seen, she conceals herself under most circumstances, but she sometimes enters into contracts with witches of sufficent ability and answers their summons.\n\nContrary to her enormous, toad-like appearance, Baal is quite light on her feet and has extraordinary jumping ability.\n\nShe is also one of the most accomplished singers in Inferno and stirs not only the soul of those who hear her voice, but even the skies themselves, and is able to manipulate air pressure to cause poison rain to fall and hurt those who would oppose her.\n\nShe also possesses an endlessly extending and sticky tongue that can snare distant opponents and swallow them in an instant.
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_96	Baal's true form, revealed by Bayonetta's "Deadly Sin" ritual.\n\nThis form is only revealed to those she has formed an eternal pact with; in other words, an opponent who sees this form has come face to face with their imminent demise.\n\nIn this form, Baal adopts a truly regal and graceful air, singing with an emotional and beautiful voice that resounds through all of Inferno, bringing a dramatic death on par with an expertly performed aria.\n\nIn fact, her love of opera is such that she occasionally journeys into the human world disguised as an average toad, sneaking up to the rafters of theaters to watch.
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_07	A gigantic, bat-like Infernal Demon that lurks in one of the darkest and deepest of Inferno's endless caves.\n\nAlthough Mictlantecuhtli looks like one Infernal Demon with four wings, it is actually a pair of brothers merged together and acting as one, with the red-bodied older brother on top, and the blue-bodied younger brother on the bottom.\n\nWith their light body, they fly swiftly and attack enemies by firing bursts of magic energy.\n\nThey can also change formation to align horizontally, which allows them to emit waves of spiritual energy like sonar, using it to detect things like invisible objects and those hiding between dimensions.\n\nAmong humans, the appearance of Mictlantecuhtli is said to herald the coming of terrible plagues.
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_08	A woman from a noble family who, drowning in despair after being abandoned by her husband, swallowed mandrake poison and took her own life.\n\nEven after death, the poison continued to devour her soul and at the height of being consumed by delusions and hallucinations, she was at last reincarnated in Inferno as a demon.\n\nWith virulent poison coursing throughout her entire body, even a slight caress from her is said to mean certain death.\n\nShe constantly searches reality for the most beautiful creatures, be they human, angel, or demon, and then injects poison into their nerves to make them unmoving "eternal lovers" to decorate her palace.\n\nInsatiable desire and obsession have painted her heart so thickly that she will never know peace. Not even with the sacrifices of a thousand souls, or a million...
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_09	An armed combat train known as "T696" that was built for national defense on one of the most remote worlds of the Multiverse, using its most advanced technology, but that was later possessed by a vengeful spirit and ultimately became an Infernal Demon.\n\nIts body is thickly plated with a unique alloy armor, and it is equipped not only with two sets of front-facing dual cannons and four sets of triple cannons along the top, but it also hides six long-barrelled cannons and six chainsaw-like crushing weapons inside its body, and due to an array of transformation mechanisms it can deploy those weapons at high speed to prepare for battle at any range.\n\nIt's said that a leader by the name of Rokuro Todoroki, driven mad by countless battles, sent the train speeding through cities and burning them as he went, finally crashing into an ammunition dump and being dragged into Inferno.\n
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_10	A giant, cephalopod-like Infernal Demon said to live in the swamp known as Stygia, a swamp filled with the ichorous blood of demons and located on the far rim of Inferno.\n\nUsually lurking at the bottom of the swamp, Kraken is said to only rise from the depths and appear on the "Day of Tears," a day that comes only once every thousand years when a rain of blood falls. However, no one has every seen its full form.\n\nIt is believed to have ten tentacles, with two of them ending in sharp, anchor-like hooks that it uses to tear into prey, and that its body splits open like flower petals to reveal a giant, voracious mouth.\n\nNo witch has ever contracted this demon, contributing to the veil of mystery that surrounds it.
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_11	A clock tower and symbol of the Umbra that once stood proudly on the cliffs on the edge of Vigrid, quietly keeping time as the world turned.\n\nDuring the Great War between the Umbra Witches and the Lumen Sages 500 years ago, the tower was knocked over and into a pit by attacking angels, with the Umbran Elder and several other witches who were defending the tower still inside.\n\nThe witches and the tower all plunged into Inferno, and the souls of the witches merged with the wreckage of the tower, which was ultimately reborn as a cursed fortress.\n\nThe structure is full of countless weapons, seemingly manifestations of the witches' lingering resentment, and any being that approaches is instantly greeted and decimated by them.\n\nBecause it is a building, it can not move from the location where it appears, but its nigh-impenetrable walls offer the most solid defense in Inferno.
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_12	An immortal man feared as the most dangerous demon in the entire barren wasteland of Inferno.\n\nOf all of the variations of the human world that can be found in the Multiverse, he seems to prefer one in particular, living and working among the humans there.\n\nIt is rumored that he was once a resident of Paradiso with the power of creation, but witnessing his acts in Inferno, most would think him more suited for destruction.\n\nThough his principal purpose for collecting the souls of Inferno's denizens is to use them in elevating the weapons he makes into unparalleled masterpieces, he himself is almost never seen sporting anything other than his bare fists—a true testament to their unbridled power. As the famed weaponsmith of Inferno, he destroys to create, then creates to destroy.\n\nWhy did he become a demon and decide to live among humans? Why does he continue to make weapons far too powerful for any mere human to wield? His true objective is still a mystery, though perhaps he is waiting for someone to appear who will finally have the power to destroy him.
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_12_02	An immortal man feared as the most dangerous demon in the entire barren wasteland of Inferno.\n\nOf all of the variations of the human world that can be found in the Multiverse, he seems to prefer one in particular, living and working among the humans there.\n\nIt is rumored that he was once a resident of Paradiso with the power of creation, but witnessing his acts in Inferno, most would think him more suited for destruction.\n\nThough his principal purpose for collecting the souls of Inferno's denizens is to use them in elevating the weapons he makes into unparalleled masterpieces, he himself is almost never seen sporting anything other than his bare fists—a true testament to their unbridled power. As the famed weaponsmith of Inferno, he destroys to create, then creates to destroy.\n\nWhy did he become a demon and decide to live among humans? Why does he continue to make weapons far too powerful for any mere human to wield? His true objective is still a mystery, though perhaps he is waiting for someone to appear who will finally have the power to destroy him.\n\n"Damn, been a long time since I had a workout like that. You come back soon, dig? I'll be here... waiting. Again."\n-Rodin, The Gates of Hell
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_13	A somewhat rootless Infernal Demon that inhabits Viola's katana, Mab Dachi.\n\nHe has not entered into an official contract with Viola, and in fact it's unclear why he helps her at all when she still can't reliably complete a summoning spell, but he willingly appears from her katana whenever she calls on him for help.\n\nUsing the cat charm hanging from Viola's katana as a host body, he looks like some kind of theme-park mascot but it's unknown if that is his true form or somehow affected by design of the charm.\n\nCheshire's relationship with Viola seems to be more like that of good friends, rather than master and servant, but the mysteries of why he has taken a liking to her when she's still not a full-fledged witch, and why he refuses to return to Inferno and instead continues to stay in Viola's katana, still remain.\n\n
CORE_BEAST_DETAIL_14	The queen of the River Styx, the mighty river which runs through the land of the dead.\n\nAlthough usually quiet and composed, it is said that if angered, she will carve out the soul of the one that has offended her with cold cruelty.\n\nAncient legends passed down speak in fear of the moths that alight on recently deceased humans as servants born from her sighs that come to lead their souls into hell.\n\nShould a witch offer her soul in exchange for a contract with Madama Styx, she will be able to obtain great power and knowledgeable counsel, but it is said that many witches have failed to properly summon her and thus lost their souls much sooner than expected.

CORE_BEAST_SUPP_DETAIL_07_1	It's really a pair of brother\ndemons connected—the red big\nbro, and the blue little bro.\nSibling rivalry's gotta be \ntough like that... (-_-;)

CORE_ANGEL_DETAIL_01	Servants of heaven that populate the lowest of the angelic hierarchy, a Third Sphere rung known simply as Angels.\n\nHumans with deep faith often feel these angels closest to their hearts. Descending from the heavens upon their pure white wings, it is believed that the glimmering halo atop an Affinity's head lights the path for those who have lost their way. \n\nThe religious articles they equip are all tools used to further their conviction to protect the righteous and can become powerful weapons used to strike down those with sullied hearts. 
CORE_ANGEL_DETAIL_02	Beloved is a member of the Second Sphere class Powers, ranked sixth in the angelic hierarchy.\n\nIts status is more that of a spiritual being, but it is also burdened with destroying the enemies of Paradiso.\n\nWhile still considered amongst the lower classes of angels, Beloved's power is of a far higher-order than that of a human, and even those with strong spiritual powers are seldom afforded the chance to meet this being. \n\nExcelling in combat, Beloved are known for brilliant exploits in demonic battles.
CORE_ANGEL_DETAIL_03	One half of a pair of twin angels. Grace, draped in flame, is always seen with Glory, controller of lightning.\n\nThese twin escorts of the Creator share a wild disposition, and are often depicted as gods of war heroically leading the soldiers of Paradiso into battle, with their giant, claw-like weapons being symbols of their ferocity.
CORE_ANGEL_DETAIL_04	One half of a pair of twin angels. Glory, the controller of lightning, is always seen with Grace, draped in flame, and together they use synchronized attacks when facing enemies. \n\nHumanity believes that the increased spiritual power of twins comes from blessings bestowed by Grace and Glory.
CORE_ANGEL_DETAIL_05	Among the nine ranks in the angelic hierarchy, Acceptance belongs to the bottom of the Third Sphere called Angels, the hierarchy's lowest rank. It appears to those who are moments away from death in a half-human, half-pegasus form with glittering wings. \n\nCharacterized as the symbol of death and acceptance, various legends tell of Acceptance solemnly placing the souls of the dead upon its back and carrying them away, ignoring their past deeds and any pleas for a second chance.
CORE_ANGEL_DETAIL_06	A large angel belonging to the Third Sphere, tasked with commanding the lowest-ranking angels.\n\nAccolades are adept at using many types of Paradiso's weaponry, including swords, spears, hammers, and whips. They use these to instill fear into the hearts of all those who doubt the might of God.\n\nAccolades have long lived in legend and at times they were said to have answered the prayers of the most devout followers by temporarily bestowing upon them one of these divine instruments.
CORE_ANGEL_DETAIL_07	Valiance is a First Sphere Cherub considered particularly ascendant as a spiritual being even among the other angels. Physical shape means little to angels of this rank as they exist in a metaphysical form that demonstrates the majesty of God.\n\nThe most ambitious and brave of the Cherubim, there are some sources that believe Valiance first arrived on Earth thousands of years ago, riding a comet of God's wrath that destroyed everything in its way.\n\nValiance's sword, the Valiantium Blade, is said to have the power to cut in two anything in Paradiso or  Inferno, and is prophesized to one day assist a team of over a hundred heroes in saving humanity from an invading evil.
CORE_ANGEL_DETAIL_08	Amongst the spiritually powerful of the Middle Ages, it was thought Paradiso held for all a Divine Will and as a result, they developed heavenly logic.\n\nThe concept of the "Cardinal Virtues" was born of this logic, and classifies Paradiso's Divine Will into four broad groups.\n  \nThese Cardinal Virtues occasionally become physical manifestations of the great intentions of Paradiso, and are known as the Laguna, inspiring awe in the masses.\n\nPersonifying courage and fortitude, Fortitudo has been depicted as a terrifying being sporting an enormous face and two dragon's heads. He is said to be capable of summoning magma flows at will. 
CORE_GOLEM_DETAIL_01	A security weapon developed long ago by the Umbra Witches and the Lumen Sages.\n\nMade of a special living metal that can change shape at will, it can immediately analyze invaders and shift into the most appropriate form for their disposal.\n\nAt its center lies a control core that receives orders from its controller, and it can operate indefinitely as long as this core remains intact.\n\nIt can also change into forms other than weapons, such as defensive walls and protective containers, and was used for a variety of purposes.\n\nAncient texts state that aside from times of emergency, it was usually kept sealed by Umbran and Lumen magic in another dimension to prevent its misuse, but that other world may have actually been the island of Thule.

CORE_DEMON_DETAIL_01	A clan of demons who infest the Malebolge caves of Inferno. They constantly scuttle in groups, searching for unfortunate prey who have lost their way. Hideous often appear in groups in the human world as well, but display no cooperation in movement. For them, there is only scrambling for prey in a mad dash.\n\nYet, while savage, Hideous possess a degree of intelligence, able to forge various weapons and rarely challenging enemies that appear in numbers larger than their own.\n\nIf one is sighted by this merciless demon, overpowering it is the only option. Only a few are capable of this—namely, the Lumen Sages who controlled the power of light and the Umbra Witches who controlled the power of darkness.
CORE_DEMON_DETAIL_02	A powerful tank with bloodstained iron wheels said to trample its enemies and drag them into a world of nightmares. According to Vigrid legend, Pain's wheels were once used for torture during inquisitions, until becoming sentient themselves and reincarnating in Inferno.\n\nSimilar to how those of strong faith are said to have rare encounters with angels, humans harboring strong feelings of doubt are more susceptible to finding themselves face-to-face with a demon.\n\nTrue to its name, Pain is said to feed on the subconscious feelings of  injury and hurt in one's soul and will appear anywhere people misguidedly attack each other in an effort to obscure their own sense of loss and loneliness.

COP_DETAIL_IT_R_036	A bright red T-shirt patterened after the logo of a game console that left an impression on Rodin during a chance visit to a video game shop.\n\nIt is a licensed product, and one of a kind.
COP_DETAIL_IT_R_998	A weathered and worn picture book that somehow found its way onto the shelves at The Gates of Hell.\n\nPerhaps having been written far in the past, the cover is nearly completely worn off and the title is illegible.\n\nSome unknown power so strong that not even Rodin himself can dispel it seals the book, and the content is a mystery.\n\nHowever, the seal is in the shape of three keyholes so with the right keys, the book might someday be opened...
COP_DETAIL_IT_R_042	A trinket modeled after a famous dog statue in front of Shibuya Station, used by many as a meeting place.\n\nIt's said that carrying this will bring you face to face with someone you've been missing for a long time.
COP_DETAIL_IT_R_043	A trinket modeled after a famous sightseeing spot with a somewhat unusual observation deck.\n\nIt's an extremely detailed replica, and for some reason everyone who visits the building buys one on the way out.
COP_DETAIL_IT_R_044	A miniature lantern modeled on the giant lantern hanging in the entrance to a famous temple.\n\nUnfortunately, for safety reasons this lantern does not light up.
COP_DETAIL_IT_R_045	A magnet Rodin modeled on a dragon-shaped catapult he saw during his travels, made out of leftover materials.\n\nBecause it's an attempt at replicating the workings of the device it's based on, it can move in a similar fashion, but it's useless as a magnet.
COP_DETAIL_IT_R_046	A figure Rodin modeled on giant warrior statues found throughout a certain land he visited, after being moved by the power they projected.\n\nThere's only one for sale, but over 1,000 prototypes were made before it was completed.
COP_DETAIL_IT_R_047	An ink painting Rodin received from a mountan mystic he happened to meet during his travels.\n\nQuite fond of it, Rodin hung it in his shop for a while, but sensing a strange presence coming from it, he quietly placed it with the other items for sale.
COP_DETAIL_IT_R_048	An hourglass with a statue of Malphas attached.\n\nBecause you have to remove the Malphas statue to turn it over and use it again, it's destined to become a paperweight.
COP_DETAIL_IT_R_049	A cushion made with a cloth adorned with a mural design Rodin learned from locals.\n\nIts texture and comfort level place it among his masterworks.
COP_DETAIL_IT_R_050	A ritual mask with a design based on the face of a god worshipped in certain desert locations.\n\nThe back is covered with strips of paper written in the local language.  
COP_DETAIL_IT_R_051	A miniature Arc de Triomphe.\n\nAlthough a fairly common souvenir, this version procured by Rodin has a secret compartment.\n
COP_DETAIL_IT_R_052	A tin ornament designed after the sightseeing buses seen zipping about the Paris.\n\nThe commitment to vintage detail can be seen in the material and aged look.\n
COP_DETAIL_IT_R_053	A magnet from a collection bearing photos of sightseeing locations.\n\nAll of the photos were taken by Rodin.
COP_DETAIL_IT_R_980	Bullets used with Super Mirrors to change the color of costumes and hair in an instant.\n\nEach costume requires its own Couleur Bullets.

COP_DETAIL_IT_S_911	A shard made of a unique blue metal.\n\nFrom the shape and pattern on its surface, it is thought to have been part of a medallion.
COP_DETAIL_IT_S_007	A bizarre, perpetually moving mechanical object.\n\nAccording to Viola, there are five Chaos Gears spread through the Multiverse, on various parallel worlds.\n\nShe claims that if all five are collected and set in an altar known as the Altar of the Skies on the island of Thule, it will become possible to travel to the parallel world of one's choice.\n \nFrom the script etched into the surface, it can be surmised that both the Umbra Witches and Lumen Sages were involved in their creation, but no other details are known.
COP_DETAIL_IT_S_008	Familiars that protect Umbran Tears of Blood, taking the forms of jet black cats.\n\nFar more agile than normal cats and distrusting of all humans, they run from all who approach at top speed, making their capture a trial for even elite witches.
COP_DETAIL_IT_S_009	Familiars that protect Umbran Tears of Blood, taking the forms of murky black toads. \n\nMore indolent than regular toads, they prefer to stay hidden in one place and croak incessantly. Despite the noise, they are skilled at hiding and finding them can be difficult.
COP_DETAIL_IT_S_010	Familiars that protect Umbran Tears of Blood, taking the forms of deep black crows. \n\nAs they fly about seemingly at random, spotting one can itself be a daunting task. Even when approached as carefully and quietly as humanly possible, they often take wing again before you can get close.
COP_DETAIL_IT_S_907	A bizarre, perpetually moving mechanical object.\nIt's said collecting all five will let you visit\nthe parallel world of your choice.
COP_DETAIL_WP_B_001	A set of four powerful handguns that were crafted by the famed weaponsmith Rodin and crowned with the names Sunshine Yellow, Orange Blossom, Green Grass, and Blue Sky.\n\nTuned for usage with the Umbran combat style called "Bullet Arts," they are not only guns with incredible stopping power, but also function as devastating melee weapons.\n\nFurthermore, as they were created to channel the power of Madama Butterfly, Bayonetta's most frequently summoned Infernal Demon, their destructive power increases exponentially when combined with the advanced magical art of the Demon Masquerade.\n\nWhen merged with Madama Butterfly during Demon Masquerade, Bayonetta gains even more powerful attacks and the ability to glide.\n\n
COP_DETAIL_WP_B_002	A large-caliber anti-materiel rifle that incorporates tissue from the Infernal Demon Gomorrah.\n\nWhile designed as a weapon to destroy targets by firing powerful armor-piercing rounds, its shape, durabiity, and mass also make it suitable for use as a particularly damaging club when swung without restraint.\n\nThe dark flame emitted when the club makes impact increases the damage dealt, and this flame can also be directly discharged at an enemy for even greater effect.\n\nWhen this weapon is used in tandem with Demon Masquerade, the user channels Gomorrah's power and brutal physicality, attacking and moving in an almost bestial manner.
COP_DETAIL_WP_B_003	A set of four yo-yos that contain clones of the Infernal Demon Phantasmaraneae's energy reactor.\n\nEquipped on the hands and feet, when swung they release sharp blades as they spin rapidly, slashing enemies while also spewing magma from their cores for additional damage.\n\nThe yo-yos equipped on the feet can also function as wheels, allowing the user to skate around at high speed.\n\nWhen these weapons are used in tandem with Demon Masquerade, the user channels Phantasmaraneae's power and assumes physical aspects of the phantom spider itself, gaining abilities like wall crawling and web swing jumps.
COP_DETAIL_WP_B_004	A pair of fans that were crafted solely from the feathers of fledglings of the Infernal Demon Malphas.\n\nLighter than paper yet more durable than steel, the fans are used to slash enemies with twin arcs of feathers.\n\nThey are capable of delivering powerful attacks on par with direct attacks from Malphas' own wings.\n\nWhen these weapons are used in tandem with Demon Masquerade, the user merges with Malphas, sprouting wings and becoming capable of flight.
COP_DETAIL_WP_B_005	A unique weapon form of Labolas, a type of Infernal Demon born when pets become lost in Inferno and adapt to survive.\n\nEquipped on the hands and feet, these remote attack units are launched at enemies and manipulated to deal blows from a distance, and can also spew freezing breath capable of reaching absolute zero from their mouths.\n\nWhen merged with Labolas during Demon Masquerade, the user takes on a quadrupedal, beast-like form and becomes able to use several of its varied abilities, like running on air and performing combination attacks with ice duplicates.
COP_DETAIL_WP_B_006	A microphone stand favored by the Infernal Demon Baal.\n\nBaal's microphone of choice when performing has continually absorbed magic over centuries of use and has taken on a number of properties quite useful for combat, such as converting voices into destructive sound waves and boosting the performer's strength and durability depending on how they sing.\n\nLight yet sturdy, the stand also doubles as a surprisingly powerful spear, and can also be used to deliver blows and piercing attacks.\n\nWhen this weapon is used in tandem with Demon Masquerade, the user channels Baal's power and gains not only the most beautiful voice in Inferno, but also the unbridled destructive power it contains.
COP_DETAIL_WP_B_007	A weapon created by Mictlantecuhtli that resembles magician's gear, composed of the hat Abra and the cane Cadabra.\n\nWhen used together, they create what at first appearance seems to be sleight of hand, but quickly escalates from doves to bombs and even entire vehicles being launched rapidly toward their targets.\n\nIt has yet to be understood how Abracadbra conjures its various attacks, and not even the user can fully predict what mysterious things will happen. \n\nWhen this weapon is used in tandem with Demon Masquerade, the user channels Mictlantecuhtli's inexplicable power, gaining the ability to split themselves in two, rain down lightning, and create other bizzare phenomena.
COP_DETAIL_WP_B_008	Whips containing the soul of the Infernal Demon Alraune, who shares her name with a demonic flower with roots planted throughout Inferno.\n\nWith a design that resembles the Alraune flower bud, even touching them slightly will fill a person's mind with Alraune's cursed screams, driving those with a weaker constituion mad instantly.\n\nA set of four whips in total, they are worn on the hands and feet and shoot out vines that stretch and contract at will, lashing enemies. The vines are supple, but as strong as steel wires and covered with sharp thorns that tear the flesh of opponents.\n\nWhen these weapons are used in tandem with Demon Masquerade, the user can control Alraune's power as if it were their own, sprouting vines all over and using them to attack at various ranges and in all directions.
COP_DETAIL_WP_B_009	A chainsaw-like weapon created by the Infernal Demon Wartrain Gouon from his own parts, with spiked wheels that spin at high speed.\n\nWeighing more than a ton, it is impossible for a normal human to wield but its sheer mass combined with the energy generated by its spinning wheels create terrifying destructive power.\n\nIn addition to its use as a weapon, it can also be straddled and used as a vehicle.\n\nWhen this weapon is used in tandem with Demon Masquerade, the user merges with Wartrain Gouon, gaining his steel body and unstoppable force with every inch of their body becoming a deadly weapon.
COP_DETAIL_WP_B_010	An anchor-like weapon once wielded long ago against the Infernal Demon Kraken, until its wielder was defeated and sunk to the bottom of the ocean. The weapon itself remained embedded in Kraken's body, absorbing magic power over the centuries.\n\nThere are also tales of this weapon's use from Japan, where a Heike general in the late Heian period is rumored to have taken it into battle against the leader of a race of demons hiding near the ocean floor, but the truth remains unclear.\n\nWhen swung, the sharpened tip is shot out on a thick chain, enabling the wielder to crush enemies from a distance.\n\nWhen this weapon is used in tandem with Demon Masquerade, the user channels Kraken's power and becomes a demonic being with the ability to swim through solid ground like water and strike with eight flexible tentacles.
COP_DETAIL_WP_B_011	A pair of thick, steel weapons with a gatelike design. Created with rubble from the fallen Umbran clock tower, their weight and the sharp spikes that adorn them result in catastrophic destructive power.\n\nAdditionally, the "gate" can open to reveal a variety of offensive machinery like gatling guns and spiked arms.\n\nSome say that the weapons were created by rancor of the Umbra witches who lost their lives when the clock tower was toppled, and that the restless spirits thronging just behind the gate are those of the women after melding with the miasma of Inferno.\n\nWhen these weapons are used in tandem with Demon Masquerade, the spirits of the fallen Umbra flow into the user, transforming them into a mechanical marionette that is immune to pain and simply continues to fight.
COP_DETAIL_WP_B_012	Mysterious bracelets once used by the fallen angel Rodin in holding dominion over a portion of Paradiso.\n\nIt is said that when equipped on the hands and feet, the bracelets adapt themselves to the user's power and memories, offering supernatural powers beyond human comprehension, but the truth of this, and of their very existence, remains a mystery. \n\nIt is believed that if one were to wear these bracelets and use Demon Masquerade, they would receive incredible magic power on par with Rodin's dark side, but whether they would be able to then end the Masquerade and return to human form is anyone's guess...
COP_DETAIL_WP_B_013	Typical handguns that, depending on the country, just about anyone can possess.\n\nDesigned to be used by normal humans, these weapons are unable to withstand Bullet Arts, so Umbra Witches must carefully control their magic energy.
COP_DETAIL_WP_B_014	Crafted by the famed weaponsmith Rodin for a Bayonetta somewhere in the Multiverse, these four guns have been crowned with the names Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme.\n\nThe durable construction of these weapons makes them able to withstand any amount of power channeled through them during the use of Bullet Arts, and they are also extremely accurate firearms.
COP_DETAIL_WP_B_015	A set of guns masterfully crafted by the famed weaponsmith Rodin for a Bayonetta somewhere in the Multiverse. They are crowned with the names Prelude, Minuet, Toccata, and Nocturne.\n\nThese weapons are no second fiddle to Scarborough Fair in terms of control and power.\n
COP_DETAIL_WP_V_051	A long-bladed katana said to have been forged by a renowned blacksmith in medieval Japan after being instructed to do so in a dream by Queen Mab, the queen of the faeries.\n\nSaid to be able to cut through anything when in the hands of a skilled swordsman, it was used by a procession of famed warriors over a long history of war.\n\nThe blade is inhabited by the Infernal Demon Cheshire, a creature that is seemingly equal parts mischievous cat and trained bear, and that manifests using the charm hanging from Mab Dachi's hilt when summoned by Viola.
COP_DETAIL_WP_V_051_02	A long-bladed katana said to have been forged by a renowned blacksmith in medieval Japan after being instructed to do so in a dream by Queen Mab, the queen of the faeries.\n\nSaid to be able to cut through anything when in the hands of a skilled swordsman, it was used by a procession of famed warriors over a long history of war.\n\nThe blade is inhabited by the Infernal Demon Cheshire, a creature that is seemingly equal parts mischievous cat and trained bear, and that manifests using the charm hanging from Mab Dachi's hilt when summoned by Viola.\n\nOver time, the katana came into Viola's possession, but some say that this was the result of  blade itself seeking the rightful heir to the faerie's power.
COP_DETAIL_WP_V_052	Viola's special throwing darts that she charges with magic power one by one.\n\nEach dart contains a glass tube full of ether, and by charging it with magic power she can change perfectly normal throwing darts into highly damaging magic missiles.\n\nHowever, since Viola doesn't particularly enjoy work that requires precise concentration, she often nods off while charging them, causing the amount of magic power in the darts to be somewhat inconsistent.
COP_DETAIL_WP_J_071	A set of four powerful handguns, crafted by the famed Infernal weaponsmith Rodin and crowned with the names Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan.\n\nTuned for usage with the Umbran combat style called "Bullet Arts," they are not only guns with incredible stopping power, but also function as devastating melee weapons.\n\nFurthermore, as they were created to channel the power of Madama Styx, Jeanne's most frequently summoned Infernal Demon, their destructive power increases exponentially when combined with the advanced magical art of the Demon Masquerade.\n\nWhen merged with Madama Styx during Demon Masquerade, Jeanne gains even more powerful attacks and the ability to glide.\n
COP_DETAIL_AC_B_001	An ancient charm crafted by the Egyptian witch Cleopatra, designed by her as leader of the Egyptian practitioners of magic to assist those who had trouble grasping the finer points of Witch Time.\n\nWhen its wearer is attacked, Witch Time is instantly triggered, expending magical power.\n\nIts shape is not fixed, and it is known to change into a variety of forms, such as an earring or bracelet, to adapt to the wearer's combat garb and fighting style.

CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_001	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nYou can see several small boats floating around an outcrop of rock protruding from the ocean.\n\nA lone man standing at the head of the lead craft raises his voice, speaking to the rest with great excitement.\n\n"Even with the power of the all-seeing Eyes, all we could gleam was bits of the knowledge of this location. But now, we have finally done it!\n\nWe have gathered shards these many years and pieced them together, leading us to this very place, and I can tell you without hesitation that what we seek lies in the skies far above where I now stand!\n\nNow my friends, let us begin! With our own hands, let us build the summit that will reach those very skies, so that me may achieve our long-awaited goal!"\n\nThe crowd react to the man's speech, raising their fists and a spirited cheer.\n\nJust as the ardor of those reacting to the man's exhortation begins to reach you, the images fade from your mind.
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_002	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nIn the midst of a vast ocean, an enormous structure towers over the surrounding area, somewhat out of place with the rest of the scenery.\n\nAt the top, a lone woman looks out over the water, a bottle in one hand as she relaxes.\n\n"This place was just a bit of rock sticking out of the water when we first came here with the Lumen, but just look at this fantastic view now! I never thought they'd have me do anything this monumental, not even in order to find that singularity up in the sky.\n\nAfter all, you'd think jumping on an Infernal Demon and riding off would get there much faster, but apparently that's not good enough. They say a proper balance of light and shadow is important in order to harness the singularity.\n\nWho am I to tell them any different? At any rate, we were able to finish the first level in just one year. In another four years the whole thing will be done. On second thought, I'll make sure it's done in two! Just you watch, you stiff-necked sages!" \n\nAs the woman begins to laugh heartily, she tosses the bottle into the ocean.\n\nJust as you feel a sense of satisfaction at the promise of a new challenge, the images fade from your mind.
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_003	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nA gigantic, manmade island rises high into the sky from the ocean's surface, and in one corner of the island, a man stands before some sort of device, his eyes narrowed.\n\n"It's been two years and eight months since I came to this place with the others, but today our island of Thule has finally fulfilled its purpose. At last, we've gained control of the singularity.\n\nThe fluctuations created by the rotation of five gears interacts with a dimensional distortion, opening the entrance to Ginnungagap, the abyss between worlds.\n\nWhat's more, by adjusting the fluctuations we've gained the ability to choose a destination world, a feat that's never been done before. The device that we developed in concert with the Umbra is perfect.\n\nAs long as we walk together, we have nothing to fear. There were many hardships, and many sacrifices, but we will continue to walk along, unravelling the mysteries of the World of Chaos and seeing that their sacrifices were not in vain.\n\nA glorious future is within our grasp!"\n\nAs you begin to fill with feelings of achievement and hope, the images fade from your mind...
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_004	As you take the weathered parchment in your hand, it reacts to magic power and faded words become legible once more...\n\n"The avatar of disaster has come from the realm of gods.\n\nFor three days and nights it has raged, finally stopped by the combined might of the Umbra and Lumen. However, due to its terrible might, we were unable to destroy it.\n\nTo prevent it from awakening again, its core was removed and sealed away within the depths of the island, where no one may enter.\n\nA portion of the metal surrounding its core was retrieved and given to scholars, with the remainder melted down and fashioned into a medallion.\n\nThat medallion was then broken into four pieces, and the pieces then left in the care of four of our most powerful, so that the medallion would never be made whole again.\n\nLet us pray that our island may now see an everlasting peace."\n\nThe words then begin to fade again, ultimately disappearing.
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_005	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nA man holding his head in consternation, with four weapons laid out before him.\n\nThe man takes one of the oddly shaped weapons in hand, and begins to moan.\n\n"Oh damn, I've done it again. What can I do with this sword?\n\nI just forged it into the shape that came into my mind, but I don't think this will make a very good weapon... and somehow I just kept going and made four of them!\n\nNo, that's not right. At first I was sure this was the right shape, but on second thought, something's definitely not right... AARGH! There's no point in making excuses to people who aren't even here. No time for that!\n\nThis is a big problem. No matter how much I was told to just follow my heart, if I end up wasting materials the master will never let me hear the end of it! What if he kicks me out or... executes me?!\n\nOkay, NOW it's time to think of an excuse! A really good excuse! Think, think, THINK! Hnnnnhhhhhhh... I've got it! This shape!\n\nWith all these edges... this is a key! A key meant to protect something very important! Not a sword, a key!\n\nNow that that's been decided, next is the lock. If I use that barrier magic I just learned, I should be able to come up with something. Something for this key!"\n\nThe man starts to yell and hastily unroll a sheet of parchment, beginning the spell to create a barrier for use in the lock.\n\nAs barrier spells start to whirl around your head, the images all fade from your mind...

As he activates it with a practiced speed, he wipes the sweat from his brow with his arm, a relieved look on his face.\n\n"Gear operational stability confirmed. The 57th dimensional transfer test is also a success!\n\nAnother success... but no matter how often I come here, I never quite get used to it.\n\nAlthough we keep the gate open, it always seems miraculous that I'm able to return back home from this abyss. Not that I don't have faith in the device, but I would be lying if I said there wasn't a degree of anxiety.\n\nAfter all, I'm going on trips by myself to search for something that not even the Eyes could find. It would be stranger if I weren't anxious.\n\nBut this is no time for complaints. Every moment counts.\n\nIn order to understand how the World of Chaos was split into countless parallel worlds, diligent if somewhat tedious investigation is necessary. Now what kind of world awaits beyond that light over there..."\n\nThe man runs off quickly, disappearing into the light.\n\nAs a mixture of apprehension and curiosity begins to fill you, the images fade from your mind.
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_007	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nIn the midst of almost total darkness, one man moves forward slowly.\n\nAlthough he takes in his surroundings carefully as he walks, he fails to notice a stone just underfoot and trips. Eventually regaining his composure, he brushes the dust from his clothing and appears thoughtful.\n\n"That was unpleasant... and I have no idea where I am.\n\nCurse the luck... I thought I'd just take a closer look at that portal since it looked so strange, but of course I end up touching it... sometimes my carelessness and bad luck surprises even me.\n\nFrom the looks of things, this seems to be a deeper layer than Ginnungagap... but this is probably no time for a calm assessment of my surroundings.\n\nSomething else is here. Right, demons?! And if I don't take care of you first, I won't be going home with my report.\n\nCreator, grant these creatures your mercy and guide them after I release them from their corporeal bonds! Oh, and ah... grant me assurance that my doors back home are securely fastened!\n\nPrepare yourselves, as I have!"\n\nThe man, while stumbling slightly, faces off against the encroaching horde of demons.\n\nAs you feel the rising of a mixure of fear and fury, the images fade from your mind.
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_008	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nA young woman paces around a room, her excitement unmistakable. After striking an enthusiastic pose, she finally sits down, her breath rapid.\n\n"I've finally made it! No more apprenticeship for me... I've finally been deemed a true Umbra Witch! I feel so proud! It's the first time I've ever seen mother that pleased. And best of all, I'm done with that excruciating training! I've never been so ecstatic!\n\nThis reminds me of something I read before...\n\nIt said that when a person's emotions reach their peak, those emotions and memories spill out and remain in that place for eternity.\n\nIf that's true, my memories of this moment will certainly remain here. I'm so excited, there's no way they won't! In fact, my precious memories, you'd just better stay here forever!\n\nOh, but wait. I think only truly powerful witches can see remnants of memory. If future Umbran sisters see these overly excited memories, I'll be a joke!\n\nWell so what, because today is a special day, and congratulations to me! And starting tomorrow, it's time to get serious and prove that I am indeed an Umbra Witch!"\n\nThe young woman strokes her hair lovingly, then stands and hurries out of the room.\n\nAs your heart begins to overflow with a warm hope for the future, the images fade from your mind.

CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_010	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nA lone witch stands in an alley, arms crossed as she periodically looks out at the street. She takes a glance at her watch and smirks.\n\n"This is the day we set things straight. I'll teach that annoying witch who really controls the streets of Shibuya!\n\nFirst that 100-song karaoke battle, then the sushi eating contest... oh, and how could I forget the scramble crosswalk foot race. Somehow they all ended in a draw, but today I'm going to pull out front and win.\n\nAfter all, today's contest is bowling! She must not know they call me the Split Queen of Sasazuka. She has only herself to blame for choosing a bowl-off on a gorgeous day like this!\n\nHmm... she's unfashionably late. That's not like her at all... if anything, she's usually annoyingly punctual for these little spats!"\n\nJust then, a roaring din fills the air as an avalanche of rubble falls. The next instant. the rubble begins to move in slow motion...\n\nAs a sensation all too familar to an Umbra Witch begins to take over, the images fade from your mind.
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_011	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nA general stands in front of an encampment, holding what must be the helmet of a fallen soldier to her chest as she looks out over the raucous battlefield.\n\nLooking down at the helmet, she lets out a deep sigh.\n\n"It has already been a week since the general fell... he was truly the bedrock on which this army stood.\n\nSometimes.... actually quite often, his attempts at grandeur ended in unintended humor, but I know what his true intentions were.\n\nThis is a battlefield. A place where lives are taken. Pulled tight by the constant tension, the soldiers' nerves are frayed to their limits. But when he played the buffoon, they were all joined in laughter and with hearts lightened, they found the will to fight again. By showing weakness, he gave them strength.\n\nBut what becomes of them now, with him gone? They give their all against this new and unknown enemy for the time being, but they cannot hide their weariness.\n\nI can't be what he was. I can't soothe their hearts—I can only give them hope by showing my own strength.\n\nI must not show weakness. I must move forward, and for his sake as well, I vow to end this battle with all of the power at my command! I will defend this land that he loved!"\n\nThe general places the helmet carefully at the root of a neaarby tree, then turns back toward the encampment.\n\nAs you feel deep sorrow burn away before a new fervor for the battle to come, the images fade from your mind.
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_012	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nIn the midst of a spacious and lavishly ornamented chamber, a woman is reclining in a long chair, but is visibly agitated. Her fist is balled tight against her chest as she frequently looks toward the entrance.\n\n"She's been acting so strange lately... it's almost as if she's avoiding me.\n\nAnd today she seems to have gone off somewhere, showing no sign of returning. Without telling me where she was going, of course...\n\nAlthough she has always attended to my needs, we were raised together since we were children, always side by side like sisters.\n\nI've never felt so separated from her in both body and soul. Could she have grown weary of me?\n\nIt is because I'm still having trouble with my training? Or because I have yet to contract even one Infernal Demon?\nI just don't know... I can think of far too many reasons...\n\nIt's no use simply sitting here wondering! She told me not to follow... but I know I'll regret it if I don't do something right away. I can feel it. \n\nI'm afraid I can't keep my promise. Forgive me, Jeanne."\n\nThe woman stands as if coming to a decision, and runs from the room with assuredness.\n\nAs you feel your heartbeat quicken with the determination to make a change, the images fade from your mind.

Gracefully, beautifully, and in silence.\n\nTonight was to be yet another elegantly executed strike... but something is very different. Beings of incredible power have appeared, destroying the city. And even worse, they seem to be after our prize.\n\nIn truth, from the start I felt that something was strange about our target. Not only was it like nothing I had ever seen before, but it also appeared just as suddenly as these interlopers did. Almost as if it had been there all along...\n\nCould it have been a coincidence? Or perhaps... a trap, set by the police to catch us unawares?! No, they're nowhere near that clever. And judging by the look on mother's face, there must have been much more to it.\n\nBut this is no time to get lost in thought, lest I get left behind. I am Papillon d'Ombre the Second, and no matter what else may come, I always get what I want."\n\nThe woman hurries to catch up to her mentor, who has already moved farther ahead.\n\nAs concern about being truly being left behind starts to smolder inside, the images start to fade from your mind.
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_014	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nBeneath a giant monitor embedded in the side of a tall building, a man comes running in something of a panic.\n\nPaying no attention to the commercials blaring from the monitor, he wipes the sweat from his forehead and steadies his breathing.\n\n"Just great... first I oversleep, then I rush out without my phone. And of course I forgot her number, so there's no way I can call. Maybe I can go back and get it? Nah, if I do that I'll definitely be late....\n\nWhat time is it anyway? I'm not even sure if I'd make it there and back at full speed... hm?\n\nHey, I recognize that song... and that voice! So it's noon exactly. Well at least I'm not late!\n\nBut... was this the right place?"\n\nThe man tilts his head in doubt, but then looks up at the monitor and decides to keep waiting for the other person to come.\n\nWith a feeling of uncertainty still lingering, the images fade from your mind.
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_015	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nA man neatly unfolds a newspaper and begins to scan the articles. As soon as a particular article catches his eye, he angrily crumples the newspaper in his hands and tosses it on the ground.\n\n"Of all the damn...! I can't believe they got away again... how many times is it now!\n\nFluttering here and there, making a fool of me! They even made me angry enough to use my gun, against my better judgement, and let off a few rounds. But I didn't even come close! Can you believe it? Not one, and I'm the best shot on the force!\n\nAnd the way they move... here one moment, there the next... are they even human?\n\nAnd what on earth was that monster! It just came out of nowhere! ...Ahh, get a hold of yourself, man! This is no way for a twenty-year veteran detective to act, no time for fear!\n\nHear me well, Papillon d'Ombre! Both of you! The next time we meet is the last time you'll know freedom! I'm going to arrest you and then my face will be on the front page of every newspaper in the country! Just you wait!"\n\nThe man picks up the crumpled newspaper and hurls it into a nearby garbage can.\n\nA burning determination—or perhaps just heartburn—wells in your chest as the images fade from your mind.
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_016	As your fingers make contact, a viscous, baleful emotion feeling pushes itself into the depths of your mind...\n\nAll you can see is darkness. A vast, all-encompassing darkness.\n\n"Wherrrrrre... is... this...\n\nWherrrrrre... wherrrrrre is... it... the... truth..."\n\nAll you can see is darkness. A deep, jet-black darkness that threatens to pull you in.\n\nYou must not touch this anymore. Your instincts scream at you to release it, and you do.\n\nImmediately, the darkness disappears and your mind regains clarity.
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_017	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nYou feel the air temperature rise sharply, and see a group of people though the hazy air. They are walking through a burning desert, wrapped in veils and cloaks to block the sun, and are moving quickly, as if fleeing.\n\n"This should do..."\n\nA woman breaks off from the group and starts to climb the tallest dune in the vicinity. Unfazed by the loose sand, she leaps gracefully to the summit. Steadying her breathing, she removes her veil to unfurl long hair that waves in the wind.\n\n"There doesn't seem to be anyone else in pursuit," she whispers, looking out across the vast desert. But there is no look of relief on her face.\n\n"I've brought them safely this far, but will I be enough..."\n\nHer eyes suddenly drawn to the sky, the last words from the guard captain echo in her mind.\n\n"Look after the others. When the time has come we will meet again, but until then, go and live together with them!"\n\nShe realizes that there is no defying those words, spoken as their eyes were locked. She turns back, sliding down the dune to where the others wait at the bottom.\n\n"There should be a settlement ahead. We'll head there for now."\n\nHer doubt now swept away, she takes the lead and walks forward again.\n\nAs you feel an unshakeable resolve take root, the images fade from your mind.

A pair of women stand close to it, ready to attempt a crossing. They start, deftly leaping between sections of some decayed ruin that peeks through the sand. However, one of the women suddently begins to change direction, and the other quickly shouts to her.\n\n"Princess, that way is dangerous!"\n\nBut her warning is already too late. The woman addressed as princess alights on a pillar that immediately crumbles, sending her into the river of sand. The princess tries to crawl out, but her every struggle only sends her sinking deeper into the sand...\n\n"Jeanne!"\n\nEven her voice eventually disappears into the sand. But just then,\n\n"FABOAN ZUMVI!"\n\nThe woman called Jeanne starts to dance quickly while chanting an incantation. As she does, a magic glyph that appears on the ground gradually changes into a large hole, and out from it leaps a giant toad. The toad flicks its tongue like a whip into the river of sand, and in an instant pulls out the sunken princess. Coughing harshly as she is gently set down, the princess struggles to breathe.\n\n"And what was that?! You were nearly dragged deep into the bowels of the earth!"\n\nAdmonishing the princess, Jeanne moves in close but the princess suddenly holds something up to Jeanne's face.\n\n"MYAOW!"\n\n"What?!"\n\nSurprised, Jeanne jumps back. The princess is holding a black kitten.\n\n"This little one almost fell in..."\n\nJeanne could only sigh. \n\n"Unbelievable..."\n\nRealizing that the cat had stolen the princess' heart, Jeanne knew that nothing she coud say would change her mind. Shrugging her shoulders, she simply said,\n\n"Today's training is over. Let's return."\n\nAs you feel a spark of interest in the kitten begin to light in Jeanne's heart, the images fade from your mind.\n\n\n
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_019	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nAt the entrance of a temple, a woman fights bravely to fend off encroaching Homunculi.\n\n"Damn... I can't let them get inside, no matter the cost!"\n\nThe others have already begun escaping into the depths of the temple. While she is determined to keep the invaders at bay here, she is outnumbered and overpowered.\n\nJust as it seems that all is lost and a cold tendril of despair begins to twist around her heart, an eerie yet beautiful song drifts from within the temple. As she hears it, her desperation begins to give way to hope. Not fully understanding whay, she begins to run toward the voice as instinct tells her it could be the only thing that will save her.\n\nHowever, as she winds through the narrow corridors, her hope is once again lost as a brutal attack from behind knocks her off of her feet. Recovering as best she can, she tumbles into a large chamber but the Homunculi are relentless as they close in.\n\nAs she steels herself to face what must surely be the end, the song drifts in once more, filling the chamber with its sound. \n\nThe woman notices the room darken slightly, as red-black mist forms above the Homunculus' heads. The mist then thickens into clouds and showers them harshly with a venomous rain. The drenched Homunculi then writhe in agony briefly, but eventually grow as still as statues before finally shattering.\n\nWatching all of this while struggling to cling to consciousness, the woman suddenly recalls that an Infernal Demon with a love of song inhabits this temple, and an image of an incongruously adorable demon fills her head.\n\nAs a silent prayer of gratitude begins to spread through your heart, the images fade from your mind.
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_020	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nYou seem to be in flight, but not aboard an airplane, or even straddling a broom. In fact, you are holding on to the back of what seems to be a monstrous bird with exceedingly colorful feathers as it streaks through the air. On both sides, there are others in similar fashion on the backs of other birds as they fly in formation.\n\n"Just a bit more, we're almost there. Look, that's where we'll set down! Hold on tight!"\n\nThe woman in the lead, riding on the largest bird in the flock, shouts to the others, gesturing far below toward what seems to be their destination: a tower surrounded by cliffs. The creatures plunge one by one toward the tower as if pulled in by its ominous aura, and their riders hold on with all of their strength to avoid being thrown.\n\nThe birds show no sign of slowing as they approach the tower's summit. Their riders all brace for imapct, but it doesn't come as the creatures spread their wings and slow down with practiced skill, touching down with almost impossible gentleness. Their riders have also been safely delivered, but nearly all of their faces betray exhaustion. However, one seemingly unfazed woman gives a clipped order.\n\n"We must hurry! We still have a long journey ahead of us."\n\nAlready seated from the fatigue of their flight, none of the others show signs of stirring. \n\nWith a sigh, she simply states, "If you continue to sit there, the wild ones will think it's feeding time."\n\nImmediately, the others' faces tighten and they stand, starting to descend the tower. She laughs heartily as she watches them go, following soon after.\n\nAs a strange mixture of exasperation and satisfaction well up inside, the images fade from your mind.
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_021	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nYou hear the sound of wind, strong and unending, inside an enormous temple. It is blowing ferociously from all around: between pillars, through holes in the floor, and nearly everywhere else. And what's more, these winds, meant to protect the temple itself, are now spreading clouds of erasure throughout.\n\nThe winds have begun to drive out those who took sanctuary here, scattering them as they look to find safety elsewhere. There are many children among them as well, and a young girl drops her stuffed animal in the confusion. \n\nThe stuffed animal is kicked further and further away from its owner, who chases after it, and the stuffed animal falls into a hole in the temple floor created by the now untamed winds. Unseeing, the girl dives in after it.\n\n"Noooooo!"\n\nThe girl's mother screams as she sees this, too late in her own pursuit... but the falling child and stuffed animal both begin to move in slow motion. At the same time, someone weaves between the crowd at incredible speed. Catching both the child and the stuffed animal, they then bound off of the temple walls and pillars, landing deftly in front of the mother.\n\nSafely back on the ground, the girl squeezes the stuffed animal and speaks in a small, hesitant voice.\n\n"Th... thank you."\n\nThe girl is looking up at the woman who rescued her.\n\n"No need to thank me. You just hold on tight to your friend, all right?"\n\nThe child nods silently.\n\n"Very good, little one. Now back to your mother, then."\n\nSeeing the girl off, the woman then turns to face the crowd and raises her voice.\n\n"Listen, all of you! I'll see you all out of here safely, I stake my life on it. Now quickly, there's no time to lose!"\n\nThe crowd regains its composure as her confident words sink in.\n\nAs the warm, somehow nostalgic feeling of a child being held by a mother begins to fill you, the images fade from your mind.\n\n

Yeah, some kind of setup!\n\nWhen they told me I was promoted, I should've known better. What the hell was I so happy for?\n\nAfter we took care of the paperwork, they told me they'd take me to base, but they stuffed me in a car and knocked me out! Then I woke up here...\n\nThere's no one around and it's dead quiet... this has to be some kind of secret facility, right?\n\nI have to learn to be more suspicious, man. Why the hell would they promote some random grunt out of nowhere?\n\nOkay... relax. No point in crying about it now. The promotion is still real, and I'm still going to get paid. It's going to be kind of weird working here when I have no idea where 'here' is, but at least the pay is good!\n\nFirst, I need to gather intel. What kind of work am I supposed to be doing? I don't even know that yet. It's also weird that no one's around. I can't be the only one in this whole giant place... can I?"\n\nNow with a new mission, the soldier stands up and stretches, walking off confidently.\n\nAs you feel the alien sensation of repressed fear, the images fade from your mind.
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_023	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nIn a room somewhere inside a cold, sterile facility, a soldier sits at a desk with his face planted on the surface as if completely drained.\n\n"Man, I can't believe the thing I was worried about was actually true... but I'm the only human in the base.\n\nI've just been following the base guides and work orders coming from the speakers all over the place.\n\nI'm supposed to just patrol the whole base, but it looks like there's already a super-tight security system set up. Basically, I just have to check on it every few days to make sure it's not broken or out of whack while I go for a walk around the perimeter.\n\nHonestly, it's a pretty easy job. A little too easy. Would the cheap-ass brass really be okay paying for something like this?\n\nThere's gotta be something else to this job. Maybe... I'm like, a chosen one or something? Or maybe it's the opposite, and I'm expendable...\n\nOkay, that's enough of that. I'll go crazy thinking about it too much. One more day on patrol, that's all there is too it. That's all..."\n\nShaking his head as if to shake off bad thoughts, the man grabs his weapon and leaves the room.\n\nAs a cold fear that can't be hidden by carefree words pours into your heart, the images fade from your mind.
CORE_NOTEL_DETAIL_024	As your fingers make contact, your head fills with the memories of someone else, playing back as a series of images...\n\nA soldier slouches in a chair, his legs up on a desk. Eyes closed, he lets out a deep sigh.\n\n"Man, what the hell was that order? 'Abandon base?!' What's going on?\n\nThis place is classified, but it's still supposed to be a military base. But since I got here two months ago I haven't even seen a stray cat, let alone any military personnel. It's been perfectly peaceful here, which is kind of fucked up if you think about it.\n\nSo why the order to leave, and with no reason given? I finally got used to this place.\n\nBut there's something about that order that bugs me. They started construction at the same time.\n\nTunnels leading underground, extra security shutters, some gnarly defensive weaponry... and everything done with automation, no humans necessary.\n\nWhatever the big deal is, it has to be underground. That's the one place I was never given clearance for.\n\nAll right, this is my last chance! Maybe I can figure out the big secret before... hey, who the hell are you guys!"\n\nSuddenly, the room fills with smoke as a group of men burst into the room and begin shooting.\n\nAs you feel consciousness begin to fade, the images fade from your mind.

The stores are still closed, and there's only a scattering of people around. Truly one of life's great pleasures.\n\nI'll head a little further into the back streets and... hey, what's that music?\n\nThat's definitely not digital. That's a nice rich tone, with just the right amount of noise... has to be vinyl.\n\nIs there a record shop around here?"\n\nThe young man stops to look around, but he can't find the source of the music.\n\n"I don't... see anything... can't tell where it's coming from... and now I can't hear anything! What was that?"\n\nAs he's lost in thought, a tendril of cigar smoke wafts under his nose.\n\n"What the hell?!"\n\nHe turns around, but no one is there.\n\n"Uh, I'm starting to feel like maybe I shouldn't be here... yeah, I'll be going now."\n\nSaying his goodbyes to thin air, the young man hurries off quickly.\n\nAs you feel a mixture of fear and respect for some unknown entity, the images fade from your mind.\n
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_01	An Umbra Witch who has left her remote European ancestral home of Vigrid behind, now living among the hustle and bustle of New York City.\n\nKeeping up appearances as a solemn, devout nun, on her days off she enjoys shopping excursions into the heart of the city. However, the flip side of that idyllic existence is a constant battle against the forces of light, in which she bends the powers of darkness to her will, leaving feathers and halos in her wake.\n\nAlthough she is called "Bayonetta" by the ever-present Enzo, Rodin, and others, only a few know her true name of "Cereza."\n\nAnd now with her assistance sought by a mysterious young woman, she journeys to the solitary island of Thule, said to hold the key to the survival of the world. 
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_02	A young woman of unknown origin who suddenly fell from the sky, escaping from her home world just before it was extinguished and somehow making her way to Bayonetta's world.\n\nShe uses her katana and magic to fight, but her abilities have yet to reach their full potential. Perhaps due to being self-conscious about this, she has an exceptionally strong need to show off her power, and takes on situations with an aggressive, almost competitive recklessness.\n\nViola is cheerful, open, and bursting with energy, which comes through in her punk fashion and is emphasized by her trademark "Torture Cats" T-shirt that features a character from the popular cartoon.\n\nHer cherished katana Mab Dachi, with a blade over three feet long, is said to be able to cut through not only physical matter but also spiritual matter with one slice, and is the key to Viola's close combat fighting style and skills.\n\nThe blade is also inhabited by Cheshire, a small Infernal Demon who's not only ready to tag into battle at the first sign from Viola, but who can also sense when she's in trouble and lend a claw, demonstrating a mysterious bond that goes beyond the usual human/demon relationship.

When Viola is in mortal danger, her love for her father and the magic power she inherited from her mother combine and amplify, awakening the faerie power within.\n\nAlthough defeated once by an extremely powerful foe, Viola was entrusted with the hopes of Bayonetta and Luka, and now stands once more to face the final battle. 
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_03	An Umbra Witch who, together with Bayonetta, survived the witch hunts of 500 years ago. She possesses magic power on par with that of Bayonetta and is able to expertly use a variety of magic arts such as advanced attack and summoning magic.\n\nJeanne is the only person Bayonetta trusts to watch her back, and they have saved each others' lives numerous times.\n\nWhile the path of Bayonetta's magical instruction has been rather unconventional, Jeanne has been trained in the orthodox Umbran way and her battle style is both beautiful and exact.\n\nNormally Jeanne spends her days as a high school teacher, but she occasionally dons a special mask to become Cutie J, and protects humanity from otherworldly threats.\n\nWhile Bayonetta takes on the task of retrieving the Chaos Gears, said to be the key to saving the world, Jeanne herself infiltrates a classified research facility to secure Dr. Sigurd, who holds valuable information about the Chaos Gears. 
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_04	A freelance journalist who appears and disappears unexpectedly as he circles the globe, driven by his passionate search for the truth.\n\nThus far he has unraveled many mysteries such as the truth behind his own father's death, the history of the Umbra Witches and Lumen Sages, and the legend of the god of Chaos, all with a recklessness that makes him seem almost possessed, and whether aware of the world's imminent collapse or no, his drive to discover the truth has brought him to the previously undiscovered shores of Thule.\n\nThe first words out of his mouth tend to be empty flirtation, but his initiative, boldness, and instincts for snatching victory from the jaws of defeat impress even Bayonetta. Over the course of their long and seemingly destined relationship they've become bound together by an emotion that goes beyond simple trust, with Luka being the only man in the world who can get away with calling her Cerezita.\n\nHis encounter with Bayonetta and Viola on this island which holds the key to saving the world couldn't have been a mere coincidence...\n

Furthermore, Luka's mind was corrupted by Dark Adam, an evil counterpart not unlike concentrated malevolence, and he was transformed into a vicious werebeast that lashed out even at Bayonetta and Viola.\n\nHowever, Bayonetta, Viola, and Lukaon risked their lives to restore Luka's self-control, and as the united Arch-Adam Origin, he fulfilled his purpose of guiding Bayonetta.\n
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_05	A brawny figure who owns and operates a seedy bar known as The Gates of Hell, nestled in a secluded corner of the city away from prying eyes.\n\nContrary to his imposing appearance, Rodin has a smooth, affable demeanor. However, the cold light that burns behind his sunglasses has been known to silence many a self-styled tough guy with a single glance.\n\nHe provides a variety of goods and services to those he forms a rapport with, ranging from food to weapons, and even seemingly otherworldly treasures. His selection is sizeable, and in shadier circles he's sometimes known as the "Infernal Gunsmith."\n\nRodin is knowledgeable about current events in Paradiso and Inferno as well as their histories, and he is frequently sought out when there's trouble of an occult nature.\n\nAs he is not originally a resident of the World of Chaos he doesn't have any counterparts in the Multiverse, but he's rumored to deal weapons to customers on other worlds as well.
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_06	An information broker who makes a living catering to the New York underworld, pulling strings to get a little something for himself.\n\nKeeping his ear to the streets and below, he never fails to catch wind of a rumor, and he can sniff out anything that could mean a payday. With luck that would make even the denizens of Inferno and Paradiso reconsider their faith, he's managed to keep his cool in some truly dangerous dealings.\n\nAs a side effect of his line of work he's got an extremely foul mouth, but he loves his wife and kids dearly and indulges them whenever possible.\n\nIn his give and take relationship with Bayonetta, he frequently skims a little off the top, but he also comes through with valuable information.\n\nAfter coming face to face with the dangers of the world's collapse he just barely survives, but with his beloved family lost he is torn apart by grief.
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_07	The man who led the anti-Singularity resistance on Viola's world, alongside that world's Bayonetta.\n\nHe doesn't possess any special abilities, but his quick thinking and cool judgement have gotten him through countless difficult situations.\n\nAmong the members of his resistance group, he took a special interest in the still-immature Viola, treating her like family and supporting her outside of battle as well as on the field.\n\nHowever, heavily outnumbered by the enemy, his fellow soldiers were decimated and after leaving his final hopes with Viola and giving her the means to travel to another world, Sigurd himself succumbed to Singularity's attack and lost his life.
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_08	A scholar who was the first to discover that the human world was actually a Multiverse consisting of layered universes, and who has devoted his life to researching it at a secret agency.\n\nIn the course of analyzing the Multiverse, he also discovered the existence of a hostile faction bent on erasing all other worlds of the Multiverse but their own, and the existence of their leader Singularity, and he now exhausts all possible methods to stand against him.\n\nIn his attempts to gather information and prepare for battle with Singularity, he has already established a method of communicating with other parallel worlds and contacted his own counterpart, resistance commander Connor Sigurd. He has also determined the existence of the Chaos Gears, essential in stopping the invasion.\n\nThe fate of the world lies with this man, and Viola has crossed the barrier between worlds to seek his help.\n\nWith Singularity also aware that he has been detected, it is possible that Dr. Sigurd's life may be in danger and Jeanne is rushing to his aid...
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_09	The entity that controls the Homunculus biological weapon horde and has called his home world the "Alphaverse." \n\nAt a plant utilizing one of the more advanced technologies of his home world, the production of artificial body parts, an anomaly occured and a completely self-aware artificial human was created—Singularity. He then began to mass produce Homunculi and rebelled against his creators, eventually eradicating all of humanity.\n\nWithin the Trinity of Realities, the World of Chaos was weakened by being split into countless parallel worlds, and Singularity has set out with the goal of erasing all other parallel worlds to reunite that power into a his own.\n\nWielding the power to travel freely between parallel worlds, he continues his invasion, but due to the difficulties of parallel world travel for advanced lifeforms besides himself, his invasion forces are composed chiefly of the lowest tier of Homunucli, the Stratus.\n\nAnd now, to gain the power of Bayonetta, whom he calls "Arch-Eve Origin" and sees as a symbol of the World of Chaos itself, he has begun murdering Bayonetta's counterparts on multiple parallel worlds.
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_10	The Bayonetta counterpart of Viola's home world, who is also Viola's mother.\n\nJoining Connor Sigurd's resistance, she fought tirelessly against Singularity's invasion but was ultimately defeated by his absolute might on the streets of a ruined New York, and after bestowing the last of her magic power upon Viola, she was wiped from existence.
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_11	The Bayonetta counterpart encountered on the first parallel world Bayonetta visits.\n\nShe battles commanding the Infernal Demon Phantasmaraneae, the "phantom spider," and uses the Ignis Araneae Yo-Yo that channels his power.\n\nWith a base of operations in Shibuya, she fights alone against the oncoming Homunculus invasion.
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_12	The Bayonetta counterpart encountered on the second parallel world Bayonetta visits.\n\nAs a general leading several thousand troops, she wages her own war against the Homunculi in the midst of a war-torn China. She had previously enjoyed a carefree, untethered life, but seems to have later formed a bond with a general who later lost his life in battle, and she took command in his stead.\n\nHaving survived an almost incomprehensible number of deadly encounters, rumors about the origin of eyepatch over her right eye abound. Some say she sacrificed the eye to save a friend, others say she lost it in a wager with an enemy, and still others say she sealed it herself to curb her own fearsome power. The truth is that the impressive figure she cuts as she rages across the field of battle has led her to be known as "The One-Eyed Witch."\n\nIt is said that no army can stand before the power of her Dead End Express, imbued with the power of the Infernal Demon Wartrain Gouon, but in the face of the relentless Homunculus onslaught it may only be a matter of time.
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_13	The Bayonetta counterpart encountered on the third parallel world Bayonetta visits, who is also the ruler of a nation that stretches across an entire desert.\n\nAlthough she receives instruction in the magic arts from her retainer Jeanne, her somewhat timid demeanor prevents her from mastering them completely and while she is a Bayonetta counterpart, she alone suffers from an apprehension that keeps her from being worthy of the Arch-Eve mantle.\n\nAlthough she is a kind witch who is averse to conflict, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance, her resolve to finally become a warrior and unlock the limitless potential hidden inside could beome the key to saving existence.
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_14	The Bayonetta counterpart encountered on the fourth parallel world Bayonetta visits.\n\nShe makes a living as a traveling performer, circling the globe showing off incredible illusions and sleight of hand—but her true persona is that of the mysterious thief Papillon d'Ombre the 2nd, daughter of master thief Papillon d'Ombre.\n\nHowever, the women are not simply thieves stealing from the corrupt and giving to the unfortunate, but are in fact Umbra Witches who have devoted their lives to reclaiming Umbran treasures that have been scattered around the world.\n\nAfter being chased tirelessly by Inspector Enzeau, the Interpol officer charged with bringing in the mother-daughter pair of master thieves, she has begun to form an odd kind of friendship with him as she continues to give him the slip.
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_15	A Bayonetta counterpart who appears during the final battle with Singularity.\n\nShe appears to be a possible Arch-Eve from a world very similar to Bayonetta's, but her eyes give off an intensity that hints at an almost unfathomable number of trials and hardships.\n\nHer weapon of choice is Scarborough Fair, a set of four handguns. With her lithe movement and unmatched aim, she takes out targets in the blink of an eye.  
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_16	Another Bayonetta counterpart who appears during the final battle with Singularity.\n\nShe also appears to be from a world very similar to Bayonetta's, and is also almost exactly alike in appearance and fighting style. Among all of Bayonetta's counterparts, she seems to have walked an almost identical path.\n\nFilled with confidence, her sharp gaze appears to be fixed on the future, and give pause to any who would stand against her.\n\nWith her four Love Is Blue handguns, she uses the Bullet Arts combat style passed down by the Umbra Witches to battle as if dancing.
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_17	An Umbra Witch Bayonetta encountered on the third parallel world she visits who serves as a retainer to the princess Bayonetta.\n\nPossessed of incredible magic power, she excels at summoning and manipulates the Infernal Demon Baal at will.\n\nAs Bayonetta's instructor in both magic and combat, she is hard on her pupil but their relationship has grown beyond that of servant and master, and they are more like sisters bound by a strong bond of trust that lead Jeanne to face the encroaching danger facing the world in Bayonetta's stead, going off to face this new enemy alone. \n\nHer noble spirit and strong mind make her the Arch-Eve of her world, but she knows the true power that lies within the Bayonetta and yearns from the bottom of her heart for the princess to take her place as the true Arch-Eve...
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_18	The mother of the Bayonetta counterpart encountered on the fourth parallel world Bayonetta visited, and the first Papillon d'Ombre.\n\nWith her daughter, she works to reclaim scattered Umbran treasures, making her way through the unseen corners of the world.\n\nHer magic power is much stronger than that of her daughter, and she could easily level an entire city were she so inclined.\n\nAlthough she and her daughter are surprised by the persistent Inspector Enzeau at every turn, they've come to view his attempts to catch them as a form of entertainment, and consider thinking of new ways to tease and torment him a guilty pleasure. 
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_21	A mysterious man that Viola encountered while lost in Ginnungagap, who also happens to be an exact double for Luka. Not appearing to be a resident of Paradiso, Inferno, or the World of Chaos, he merely left behind mysterious words that left it unclear if he was friend or foe before leaving Viola alone with her thoughts.
CORE_CHARA_DETAIL_21_02	A mysterious man that Viola encountered while lost in Ginnungagap, who also happens to be an exact double for Luka. Not appearing to be a resident of Paradiso, Inferno, or the World of Chaos, he merely left behind mysterious words that left it unclear if he was friend or foe before leaving Viola alone with her thoughts.\n\nHowever, he was later revealed to be the king of a group known as "faeries" that resides in a secluded corner of the human world, and a counterpart of Luka.\n\nLike Luka, he is also being guided by the voice in his head that compels all Arch-Adams to seek "the single truth,"  and he has traveled continuously between worlds.\n\nThe faeries are said to be residents of a particularly far-flung part of the Multiverse, and to possess a mysterious power that humans do not.\n\nAs a result of Singularity's erasure of a large number of parallel worlds, resonance between counterparts is occurring and Lukaon's power has an effect on Luka, as well as his blood relative Viola.\n\nAlso, as a result of meeting Lukaon face to face, Luka was reawakened as "Arch-Adam Origin" and able to fulfill his true purpose.\n\nIt is said that since long ago, the faeries have hidden themselves in worlds where humans live, leading quiet existences, and hints to the truthfulness of that idea can be seen in folk tales and legends from around the world.
