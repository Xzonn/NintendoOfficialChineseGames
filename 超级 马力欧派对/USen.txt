bdr001_ms_00	Hello, rafters! Welcome to {c[ffdc0f]}River Survival{c[ffffff]}!
bdr001_ms_20	Is this your first time rafting\r\nthese waters?
bdr001_ms_21	Yes
bdr001_ms_22	No
bdr001_ms_23	This spot has a long history of being used as a\r\nlaunching point for river expeditions.
bdr001_ms_24	The gentle flow and the fresh air out here might\r\nmake you think river rafting will be a breeze.
bdr001_ms_35	{c[ffdc0f]}Think again!{c[ffffff]}
bdr001_ms_25	Past this point, things get downright turbulent!
bdr001_ms_26	You'll be up against raging rapids,\r\nrocky obstacles...
bdr001_ms_27	and very territorial wildlife. {c[ffdc0f]}Danger awaits{c[ffffff]}!
bdr001_ms_29	It's actually pretty nerve-racking...
bdr001_ms_30	*cough* *cough*
bdr001_ms_31	Every so often, the river will branch off.
bdr001_ms_32	There are so many branches down this river,\r\nwe still haven't figured them all out!
bdr001_ms_33	Everyone, keep a clear head and you'll {c[ffdc0f]}survive\r\n{c[ffffff]}this together!
bdr001_ms_15	Just to be sure, does everybody know the rules\r\nfor rafting?
bdr001_ms_19	Review the rules?
bdr001_ms_02	Yes
bdr001_ms_03	No
bdr001_ms_04	Use your oar to paddle the raft.
bdr001_ms_06	When the clock runs out,\r\nyour expedition is over.
bdr001_ms_05	Pop {c[ffdc0f]}balloons {c[ffffff]}to play minigames!
bdr001_ms_34	Depending on how well you do in minigames,\r\nyou'll get extra time on the clock!
bdr001_ms_09	The key to river rafting is {c[ffdc0f]}cooperation{c[ffffff]}.
bdr001_ms_10	Here, let's practice acting as one!
bdr001_ms_11	Yep! Just like that!
bdr001_ms_14	Whoops, we were a little out of sync there.
bdr001_ms_18	But cheering each other on is surprisingly\r\nimportant on a river excursion!
bdr001_ms_17	Oh! We're getting close to the starting line!
bdr001_ms_12	{c[ffdc0f]}It's us against the river!{c[ffffff]}

bds001_st1_100	Welcome to the {c[ffdc0f]}Jungle Adventure{c[ffffff]}, a thrilling\r\n{c[ffdc0f]}test of teamwork{c[ffffff]}!
bds001_st1_101	Is this your first time here as a {c[ffdc0f]}team{c[ffffff]}?
bds001_st1_101_a	Yes
bds001_st1_101_b	No
bds001_st1_102	Our researchers have discovered {c[ffdc0f]}new challenges{c[ffffff]}\r\nfor teams to master in these ancient ruins.
bds001_st1_103	{c[ffdc0f]}Priceless treasures {c[ffffff]}are there for the taking, for those\r\nwith the keys to unlock them.
bds001_st1_104	Just one small problem—the huge {c[ffdc0f]}Whomps blocking your\r\nteam's way{c[ffffff]}!
bds001_st1_105	No one gets past me! No one! It don't matter if\r\n{c[ffdc0f]}you're a team or not{c[ffffff]}!
bds001_st1_106	I don't let no one through! \r\nUnless they got {c[ffdc0f]} coins{c[ffffff]}.
bds001_st1_107	Oh yeah, and {c[ffdc0f]}I won't talk to you if you're\r\nbehind me{c[ffffff]}.
bds001_st1_108	If you got somethin' to say, you can say it to\r\nmy face!
bds001_st1_109	Yep. Plenty of challenges here to put your\r\n{c[ffdc0f]}teamwork{c[ffffff]} to the test!
bds001_st1_110	{c[ffdc0f]}Team adventures {c[ffffff]}are a bit different.\r\nDo you need a refresher on the rules?
bds001_st1_111	Hear the rules?
bds001_st1_111_a	No
bds001_st1_111_b	Yes
bds001_st1_120	Both players roll their dice at the same time.
bds001_st1_121	You can move in any direction.
bds001_st1_122	Your team's first order of business should be to\r\ncollect lots of {c[ffdc0f]} coins{c[ffffff]}!
bds001_st1_123	While one teammate is busy collecting {c[ffdc0f]} coins{c[ffffff]}...
bds001_st1_124	the other teammate might move toward\r\nthe {c[ffdc0f]} Star{c[ffffff]}.
bds001_st1_125	To win, you'll need good communication and\r\nteamwork.
bds001_st1_126	Remember, if you stomp on a rival, you can {c[ffdc0f]}steal their  coins{c[ffffff]}!
bds001_st1_127	Think you've got enough {c[ffdc0f]} coins{c[ffffff]} from minigames?
bds001_st1_128	Then {c[ffdc0f]}land{c[ffffff]} on this space to get a {c[ffdc0f]} Star{c[ffffff]}!
bds001_st1_129	So what's your game plan? {c[ffdc0f]}Go  Star hunting{c[ffffff]}?\r\nOr {c[ffdc0f]}stomp your rivals{c[ffffff]}?
bds001_st1_130	Will you {c[ffdc0f]}stick together{c[ffffff]} or {c[ffdc0f]}split up{c[ffffff]}?
bds001_st1_131	{c[ffdc0f]}Talk it over{c[ffffff]} before starting your adventure!
bds001_st1_132	All right, let's roll to see who {c[ffdc0f]}goes first{c[ffffff]}.
bds001_st1_133	The total of {c[ffdc0f]}both teammates' dice {c[ffffff]}will decide.
bds001_st1_134	First up is {c[ffdc0f]}Team [n0]{c[ffffff]}!
bds001_st1_135	And going second, {c[ffdc0f]}Team [n0]{c[ffffff]}!
bds001_st1_140	OK! Now then, where's the {c[ffdc0f]}first  Star{c[ffffff]} you'll be\r\nheading for?
bds001_st1_141	There it is! {c[ffdc0f]}Land here{c[ffffff]} and get the  Star!
bds001_st1_142	If both players land on this space, you can\r\n{c[ffdc0f]}get two  Stars{c[ffffff]}!
bds001_st1_143	Hang on! Before you set off, show me some of\r\nthat {c[ffdc0f]}teamwork in action{c[ffffff]}!
bds001_st1_144	{c[ffdc0f]}Nice! Thumbs-up from me!{c[ffffff]}
bds001_st1_145	{c[ffdc0f]} Coins, items, and love are shared between\r\nteammates{c[ffffff]}. (I hope!) Teamwork is the key to\r\nsuccess.
bds001_st1_146	OK! Let's start with {c[ffdc0f]}the team that's up first{c[ffffff]}!
bds001_st1_000	Welcome, {c[ffdc0f]}adventurers{c[ffffff]}! The time has come at last\r\nfor your first foray.
bds001_st1_001	This IS your first time, right?
bds001_st1_001_a	Yes
bds001_st1_001_b	No
bds001_st1_010	These are {c[ffdc0f]}ancient ruins{c[ffffff]}, shrouded in mystery.\r\nWhat purpose did they once serve?
bds001_st1_011	I don't know what's worse, the hair-raising {c[ffdc0f]}traps{c[ffffff]}...
bds001_st1_012	or the giant {c[ffdc0f]}Whomps{c[ffffff]} blocking your path!
bds001_st1_013	{c[ffdc0f]}No entry{c[ffffff]}! Nobody gets past here! Nothin' doin'!
bds001_st1_014	Unless you're willing to cough up a {c[ffdc0f]} coin{c[ffffff]} or two.

bds001_st1_032	Watch out for {c[ffdc0f]}Red Spaces{c[ffffff]}!
bds001_st1_033	If you can win the minigames, you'll get lots of {c[ffdc0f]} coins{c[ffffff]}!
bds001_st1_034	But there's more to it than that!
bds001_st1_035	Having a lot of {c[ffdc0f]} coins{c[ffffff]} is nice,\r\nbut it's not enough to win.
bds001_st1_036	The real measure of victory is {c[ffdc0f]} Stars{c[ffffff]}!\r\nWhoever has the most Stars at the end wins.
bds001_st1_037	Even if you have 100 {c[ffdc0f]} coins{c[ffffff]}, you could still\r\nbe in trouble if you only have one {c[ffdc0f]} Star{c[ffffff]}.
bds001_st1_038	It's just like they say: {c[ffdc0f]} Stars{c[ffffff]} make the\r\nworld go 'round!

bds001_rstsp_01_e	{c[ffdc0f]}Team [n1]{c[ffffff]} is having some trouble.\r\nTheir teamwork could use, well, work.

bds001_rstsp_06_00_b	I'm certain {c[ffdc0f]}Team [n0]{c[ffffff]} will win.\r\nI'd estimate it to be a 70%...no, 80% chance!
bds001_rstsp_06_00_c	{c[ffdc0f]}Team [n0]{c[ffffff]} will come from behind\r\nto win. I'm reasonably, probably certain of it.

bds001_rstsp_07_j_00b	{c[ffdc0f]}[n0]{c[ffffff]} will come from behind\r\nto win. I'm reasonably, probably certain of it.
bds001_rstsp_07_j_00b_kp	{c[ffdc0f]}[n0]{c[ffffff]} will come from behind\r\nto win. I'm as certain as any good minion could be.
bds001_rstsp_06_01_a	I can't see {c[ffdc0f]}Team [n0]{c[ffffff]} not winning.\r\nThey have the scent of victory on them.
bds001_rstsp_06_01_b	{c[ffdc0f]}Team [n0]{c[ffffff]} will obviously win.\r\nTheir confidence speaks for itself.
bds001_rstsp_06_01_c	I think {c[ffdc0f]}Team [n0]{c[ffffff]} will end up winning.\r\nI have nothing to back that up—it's just a hunch.
bds001_rstsp_07_b_00	I can't see {c[ffdc0f]}[n0]{c[ffffff]} not winning.\r\nThey have the scent of victory on them.

bds001_rstsp_07_b_00c_kp	I think {c[ffffff]}Lord {c[ffffff]}{c[ffdc0f]}[n0]{c[ffffff]} will end up winning.\r\nI have nothing to back that up, apart from loyalty.
bds001_rstsp_08	There you have it, folks! For that, we present\r\n{c[ffdc0f]}Team [n0]{c[ffffff]} with {c[ffdc0f]}[0]{c[ffffff]}!
bds001_rstsp_09	There you have it, folks! For that, we present\r\n{c[ffdc0f]}[n0]{c[ffffff]} with {c[ffdc0f]}[0]{c[ffffff]}!
bds001_rstsp_10	We're entering the homestretch now!

bds001_charaget_txt01	A useful, well-balanced die! Use the\r\nabundance of 3s to your advantage.
bds001_charaget_txt02	A die with high highs and low lows.\r\nIt's easy to roll a 1, but that can be useful too.
bds001_charaget_txt03	Odds are good that you'll roll a 4, but there's\r\nalways that chance of getting a 0.
bds001_charaget_txt04	Looking to travel 3, maybe 4 spaces?\r\nThis die is for you!
bds001_charaget_txt05	Sure, there are some downsides, but every\r\nother face has a 6! What could go wrong?
bds001_charaget_txt06	Odds are good that this die will get you at least\r\nfive spaces! Just watch out for that coin drain.
bds001_charaget_txt07	A balanced die that can go as high as 7.\r\nEven an average roll of 3 is pretty good.
bds001_charaget_txt10	A die with a 50% chance of rolling a 7?! That\r\nmight be powerful enough to overlook the 0s!
bds001_charaget_txt11	An out-of-this-world die that makes it easy to get  coins!\r\nNot only that, one side advances you a whopping 8 spaces.
bds001_charaget_txt12	With three 0 faces, this is a high-risk die. But the\r\ntwo 10 faces are a reward that might be worth it.
bds001_charaget_txt50	You could rocket forward with a 10 or just as easily lose coins.\r\nOnly the bravest are gutsy enough to use this die!
bds001_charaget_txt51	A solid die that combines balanced numbers\r\nwith a strong possibility of gaining  coins.
bds001_charaget_txt52	If the place you need to be is exactly 4 spaces away, use\r\nthis die. Even if you roll the 0, you'll get there eventually.
bds001_charaget_txt53	All those low numbers might seem slow and steady,\r\nbut it's that 10 that'll win you the race.
bds001_charaget_txt54	Without a 1 on any face, this is an effective die\r\nif you end up right next to an undesirable space.
bds001_charaget_txt55	Will you get a 1? Or a 6? Roll these bones\r\nand you'll either win big or inch forward.
bds001_charaget_txt56	With a max of 9 but three chances to roll a 1,\r\nthis die is high risk, high reward!
bds001_charaget_txt58	The 5s and 7s are attractive, to be sure,\r\nbut keep in mind the possibility of losing coins.
bds001_charaget_txt59	You'll most likely get a 5, but even if you\r\ndon't, you might get 3  coins instead!
bds001_charaget_txt60	Hey, 3's a good number, right? Yeah!\r\nAnd who knows, maybe you'll hit the 8!

bds001_map_ht_st2_01	When the timer in front of {c[ffdc0f]}King Bob-omb{c[ffffff]}\r\nhits 0...it's safe to say you're not safe!
bds001_map_ht_st2_02	There might also be a doohickey somewhere\r\nnear him that makes the count go down...
bds001_map_ht_st2_03	Anyway, just be careful!
bds001_st2_txt_00	Gold-Mine Gamble
bds001_st2_txt_01	Still pretty dangerous...
bds001_st2_txt_02	Still pretty dangerous...
bds001_st2_ev00_00	How many coins will you offer?
bds001_st2_ev00_01	If you pay some {c[ffdc0f]} coins{c[ffffff]}, Bob-omb\r\nmight look for {c[ffdc0f]}[0] {c[ffffff]}for you!
bds001_st2_ev00_02	You paid a lot of {c[ffdc0f]} coins{c[ffffff]}, so Bob-omb's\r\nreally gonna try! Have faith!
bds001_st2_ev00_03	You forked over a fair number of\r\n{c[ffdc0f]} coins{c[ffffff]}, so he'll search fairly hard.
bds001_st2_ev00_04	Maybe it's because you didn't pay a lot of {c[ffdc0f]} coins{c[ffffff]},\r\nbut Bob-omb doesn't seem motivated. Well...good luck!
bds001_st2_ev00_05	Wow! Just look at {c[ffdc0f]}Bob-omb{c[ffffff]}'s radiant smile!
bds001_st2_ev00_06	His eyes say, "Sorry, this is all I found."
bds001_st2_ev00_07	His whole attitude says, "I'm not helping\r\nwithout a bunch more {c[ffdc0f]} coins{c[ffffff]}."
bds001_st2_ev01_00	There's no way to break this without a {c[ffdc0f]}pickaxe{c[ffffff]}.
bds001_st2_ev02_00	Ooh, let me "trainslate"! He's saying, "{c[ffdc0f]}Welcome\r\nto the mine cart{c[ffffff]}. Hop in and go for a ride."
bds001_st2_ev03_00	Dig here and you might find {c[ffdc0f]} coins{c[ffffff]}!
bds001_st2_ev03_01	But be careful! If you break the {c[ffdc0f]}pickaxe{c[ffffff]},\r\nyou won't be able to get any {c[ffdc0f]} coins{c[ffffff]}.
bds001_st2_ev03_tip00	Dig for gold!
bds001_st2_ev03_02	Would you like to dig for\r\n{c[ffdc0f]} coins{c[ffffff]} a bit more?

bds001_st2_ev03_03_a	Yes

bds001_st2_ev05_00	Something about him says,\r\n"I'll be bugging you for a while."
bds001_st2_ev05_00_a	I think he's saying, "Sorry if I'm in\r\nyour way. No hard feelings, OK?"
bds001_st2_ev05_00_b	Pretty sure that's Bob-omb for\r\n"I sure am annoying, huh?"
bds001_st2_ev05_01	Bob-omb is following you.

mgm004_guide002_b	No
mgm004_guide003	So let's get started!
mgm004_guide010	Let's hear it for {c[ffdc0f]}[n0]{c[ffffff]}!
mgm004_guide010_1	Go ahead and {c[ffdc0f]}claim a panel {c[ffffff]}from the middle!
mgm004_guide020	Now {c[ffdc0f]}[n0] {c[ffffff]}can claim {c[ffdc0f]}a panel next to\r\n{c[ffffff]}one already claimed!
mgm004_guide030	Little by little, players will have more panels to choose from.
mgm004_guide030_1	Well then, {c[ffdc0f]}[n0]{c[ffffff]}, \r\nwhich panel would you like?
mgm004_guide031	You can steal a rival's panel by trapping\r\nit {c[ffdc0f]}between two panels {c[ffffff]}of your own.
mgm004_guide031_1	Think carefully about which panel to select!
mgm004_guide032	Go ahead! Take {c[ffdc0f]}one panel{c[ffffff]}!
mgm004_guide033	Half the panels are claimed!
mgm004_guide033_1	{c[ffdc0f]}[n0]{c[ffffff]}, select a panel!
mgm004_guide034	There aren't many panels left!
mgm004_guide035	{c[ffdc0f]}[n0] {c[ffffff]}has the final choice!
mgm004_guide035_1	Now then, please claim your final panel!
mgm004_guide040	Congratulations, {c[ffdc0f]}[n0]{c[ffffff]}!
mgm004_guide040_1	There's the +1! Choose {c[ffdc0f]}one more {c[ffffff]}panel!
mgm004_guide050	Wow! {c[ffdc0f]}[0] people {c[ffffff]}won the minigame!
mgm004_guide050_2	Wow! {c[ffdc0f]}Two people{c[ffffff]} won the minigame!
mgm004_guide051	But only one of them can choose a panel.
mgm004_guide051_1	We'll break the tie with a roll! Whoever gets\r\nthe {c[ffdc0f]}highest number {c[ffffff]}on the dice block chooses!
mgm004_guide052	Hmm. That minigame resulted in a {c[ffdc0f]}tie{c[ffffff]}.
mgm004_guide060	The first panel goes to {c[ffdc0f]}[n0]{c[ffffff]}!
mgm004_guide061	All the chosen panels belong to {c[ffdc0f]}[n0]{c[ffffff]}!
mgm004_guide062	W-w-wow! It's an {c[ffdc0f]}all-way tie{c[ffffff]}!

mgm004_guide070	Each turn starts with a 4-player minigame.
mgm004_guide071	But only {c[ffdc0f]}one player{c[ffffff]} can win the minigame.
mgm004_guide072	As you play, you may manage to {c[ffdc0f]}trap {c[ffffff]}your rival's panel\r\nbetween two of your own.
mgm004_guide073	If you can do that, then the trapped panel is {c[ffdc0f]}yours{c[ffffff]}!
mgm004_guide074	If the panel you claim turns out to be a {c[ffdc0f]}+1 panel{c[ffffff]}...
mgm004_guide075	After 12 rounds, whoever has {c[ffdc0f]}the most panels {c[ffffff]}is the winner!
mgm004_guide100	{c[ffdc0f]}[n0]{c[ffffff]}, you're in 4th place,\r\nso you can choose the next minigame!

mgm004_guide203	What's this?\r\n{c[ffdc0f]}[n0] {c[ffffff]}already has all the panels!
mgm004_guide204	Things seem dire, but don't give up yet!\r\nThe next round could change everything!
mgm004_guide300	It's time for the final round!
mgm004_guide300_1	It's anybody's game now!

op_cut01_Nar00	One day, trouble was brewing between\r\nMario and his good friends.
op_cut01_Nar01	Each claimed to be the Super Star,\r\nthe worthiest hero in all the land.
op_cut01_Nar02	Mario suggested having a party to\r\ndecide, a time-honored tradition.
op_cut02_Nar00	Everyone agreed—a proper party would\r\nsurely reveal true Super Stardom.
op_cut03_chr00	What do you say, Toadette?
op_cut03_chr00a	I say this time we're going to find out what\r\nbeing a Super Star REALLY means!
op_cut03_chr01	You can trust us to be fair and impartial judges!
op_cut03_chr01a	Give us time to set up and we can get st—
op_cut03_chr02	Aren't you forgetting something?!
op_cut04_chr00	Maybe NONE of you are the Super Star!\r\nMaybe it's one of US instead!
op_cut04_chr00a	Right, troops?
op_cut05_chr00	I brought an extra judge, too!
op_cut05_chr01	Hey, Kamek!
op_cut05_chr02	I want you keeping an eye on things too!\r\nYou know, so it's all "fair" and "impartial."
op_cut06_chr00	If you say so!
op_cut06_chr00a	But be careful what you wish for. Keeheehee!
op_cut07_chr00	Well, at least Kamek will make setting up easy!\r\nThis should only take a minute!
op_cut08_chr00	Is everybody else as excited as I am?! I DOUBT IT!

plz001_1_02_A_01_kp	For security purposes, this area is off-limits\r\nto all except certain personnel.
plz001_1_02_B_00	I've never been one for the beaten path. I tend\r\nto prefer side attractions over the main event.
plz001_1_02_B_01	That said, it's still nice to get back\r\nto {c[ffdc0f]}Mario Party {c[ffffff]}once in a while!

plz001_1_13_A_01	Just accept it, think about what you could've\r\ndone differently, and try again.
plz001_1_13_A_00_kp	It's not the end of the world if you lose.
plz001_1_13_A_01_kp	Not that I'm suggesting you would\r\never lose, Lord {c[ffdc0f]}[n0]{c[ffffff]}!
plz001_1_13_B_00	Let me know when you collect {c[ffdc0f]}stickers{c[ffffff]}\r\nso I can watch from a safe distance away.
plz001_1_13_B_01	Those {c[ffdc0f]}stickers{c[ffffff]} are small and thin, and I'd hate\r\nfor them to blow away when I flap my wings.

plz001_02.msbt
plz001_2_13_A_00	Hey, you got two {c[ffdc0f]} Gems{c[ffffff]}! Look at you!

kinopad_topics_txt_00_00	An ancient jungle ruin. The Whomps won't let\r\nyou through unless you pay, but if you do, they're\r\nunusually nice!
kinopad_topics_txt_00_00_1	\r\nWatch out for the Event Space on the high road!\r\nLanding there will trigger a boulder trap\r\nguaranteed to set you back. The item shop in back\r\nsells some handy stuff, so be sure to stop in.
kinopad_topics_txt_00_01	King Bob-omb presides over a dangerous court!\r\nEach time someone lands on one of the Event\r\nSpaces around the King, the count will go down.\r\nWhen it reaches 0, every player standing in\r\nthe blast zone will lose half their coins.
kinopad_topics_txt_00_01_1	\r\nIt might seem cute when the Bob-ombs you pass\r\nstart to follow you, but they're actually a nuisance.\r\nThey'll subtract their own rolls from yours on every\r\nturn! Don't trust them!
kinopad_topics_txt_00_02	A tropical hop around four little islands. You can\r\nuse the color-coded pipes to warp around. Don't\r\nget stuck on the sand bridge when it collapses!
kinopad_topics_txt_00_02_1	\r\nOnce both big sparklers are lit, whoever\r\nignited the second one will get a Star!
kinopad_topics_txt_00_03	A dazzling town built by Kamek. The cost of getting\r\na Star changes constantly, so it's important to time\r\nyour transactions right.
kinopad_topics_txt_00_03_1	\r\nTiming is money! If a Toady catches you, it'll grab\r\nand move you, so use them wisely. The Chain Chomp\r\ncan be another harrowing hazard if it gets loose.
kinopad_topics_txt_01_00	A useful, well-balanced die! Use the\r\nabundance of 3s to your advantage.
kinopad_topics_txt_01_01	A die with high highs and low lows.\r\nIt's easy to roll a 1, but that can be useful too.
kinopad_topics_txt_01_02	Sure, there are some downsides, but every\r\nother face has a 6! What could go wrong?
kinopad_topics_txt_01_03	Odds are good that this die will get you at least\r\n5 spaces! Just watch out for that coin drain.
kinopad_topics_txt_01_04	Odds are good that you'll roll a 4, but there's\r\nalways that chance of getting a 0.
kinopad_topics_txt_01_05	Looking to travel 3, maybe 4 spaces?\r\nThis die is for you!
kinopad_topics_txt_01_06	A balanced die that can go as high as 7.\r\nEven an average roll of 3 is pretty good.
kinopad_topics_txt_01_07	An out-of-this-world die that makes it easy to\r\nget  coins! Not only that, one side advances\r\nyou a whopping 8 spaces.
kinopad_topics_txt_01_08	With three 0 faces, this is a high-risk die. But the\r\ntwo 10 faces are a reward that might be worth it.
kinopad_topics_txt_01_09	A die with a 50% chance of rolling a 7?! That\r\nmight be powerful enough to overlook the 0s!
kinopad_topics_txt_01_10	You could rocket forward with a 10 or\r\njust as easily lose coins. Only the bravest\r\nare gutsy enough to use this die!
kinopad_topics_txt_01_11	A solid die that combines balanced numbers\r\nwith a strong possibility of gaining  coins.
kinopad_topics_txt_01_12	All those low numbers might seem slow and\r\nsteady, but it's that 10 that'll win you the race.
kinopad_topics_txt_01_13	The 5s and 7s are attractive, to be sure,\r\nbut keep in mind the possibility of losing coins.
kinopad_topics_txt_01_14	If the place you need to be is exactly 4 spaces\r\naway, use this die. Even if you roll the 0, you'll\r\nget there eventually.
kinopad_topics_txt_01_15	With a max of 9 but three chances to roll a 1,\r\nthis die is high risk, high reward!
kinopad_topics_txt_01_16	Will you get a 1? Or a 6? Roll these bones\r\nand you'll either win big or inch forward.
kinopad_topics_txt_01_17	You'll most likely get a 5, but even if you\r\ndon't, you might get 3  coins instead!
kinopad_topics_txt_01_18	Without a 1 on any face, this is an effective die\r\nif you end up right next to an undesirable space.
kinopad_topics_txt_01_19	Hey, 3's a good number, right? Yeah!\r\nAnd who knows, maybe you'll hit the 8!
kinopad_topics_txt_02_00	The Dueling Glove is used to challenge a rival with\r\nan ally at stake. If you beat your rival in the battle,\r\none of their allies will join you instead!
kinopad_topics_txt_02_00_1	\r\nBut it works both ways: If you lose the battle,\r\none of your allies will join your rival. Of course,\r\nif you don't have any allies yet, you can't lose!\r\nDuel away!
kinopad_topics_txt_02_01	A tornado that sucks up coins from a rival. It's good\r\nto use on a rival with lots of coins.
kinopad_topics_txt_02_01_1	\r\nBut you might also want to use it on someone who\r\nhas a Star so they have a hard time getting more.\r\nThink carefully before you send it out!
kinopad_topics_txt_02_02	If a rival gets a Fly Guy Ticket, it might be wise\r\nto use your items before they're stolen.
kinopad_topics_txt_02_02_1	\r\nOn the other hand, your rival can't choose which\r\nitem to steal. So another strategy is to have lots\r\nof items, making it less likely that you'll lose the\r\nreally important ones!
kinopad_topics_txt_02_03	A very handy Golden Pipe that allows\r\nyou to warp close to a Star.
kinopad_topics_txt_02_03_1	\r\nYou can use it whenever you want, but the best way\r\nto use it is to wait until the Star is near item shops\r\nor other useful spaces.
kinopad_topics_txt_02_03_2	\r\nIf the Star isn't near other places you'd like to go,\r\nit may be better to wait until it's in a better spot.
kinopad_topics_txt_03_00	Allies are useful! They can roll extra dice for you,\r\nmaking it easier to reach Stars. You can have up to\r\nfour allies at a time, but the most important thing is\r\nto have more than your rivals!
kinopad_topics_txt_03_01	If you're trying to reach a particular space, check\r\nyour available dice. Think about which die has the\r\ngreatest chance of landing on that space. If you\r\nlearn to use different dice for different situations,\r\nyou'll be ahead of the game!
kinopad_topics_txt_03_02	It may seem odd, but if all of your rivals are heading\r\ntoward the Star, it could be a good idea to head out\r\nin a different direction. When the Star moves, you\r\ncould be in a prime position to pounce on it.
kinopad_topics_txt_03_02_1	\r\nEven if you aren't, there might be some promising\r\nevents to take advantage of. Sometimes the road\r\nless traveled is more rewarding!
kinopad_topics_txt_03_03	Often, item shops off the beaten path have good\r\nitems for sale. When choosing a path to your\r\ndestination, remember to factor in things like\r\nthis instead of simply taking the shortest route.\r\nThe right item at the right time could turn the tide!
kinopad_topics_txt_04_00	A treasure sleeps within this ancient ruin.\r\nYou'll need a key to open the treasure chest,\r\nbut with luck you might find two Stars inside!
kinopad_topics_txt_04_00_1	\r\nThe Whomps that block your way one minute\r\ncould end up helping you the next by getting in\r\nthe way of your rivals.
kinopad_topics_txt_04_00_2	\r\nTake caution when treading down paths where\r\nlarge boulders frequently fall!
kinopad_topics_txt_04_01	Be careful of King Bob-omb. Stepping on certain\r\nspaces around him will cause the countdown to\r\nadvance. If the countdown reaches zero, everyone\r\naround King Bob-omb will lose half their coins.
kinopad_topics_txt_04_01_1	\r\nDon't overlook the gold mine. Bring your pickaxe,\r\nand you can dig for something even better than\r\ngold—you might find Stars!
kinopad_topics_txt_04_02	A great adventure through a series of tropical\r\nislands.
kinopad_topics_txt_04_02_1	\r\nThe four islands are connected by a series of\r\ncolor-coded pipes. Land on an Event Space to\r\nwarp to the island on the other end of the pipe.
kinopad_topics_txt_04_02_2	\r\nUse the silver pick and get on the watermelon to\r\ngrab the Star and coins! There's only one silver\r\npick, so it belongs to whoever gets there first!
kinopad_topics_txt_04_03	An opulent place filled with towers that rise\r\ninto the skies. If you're lucky at playing the\r\ncapsule machine, you could win a Star or two!
kinopad_topics_txt_04_03_1	\r\nThe shop on the lower right is a little sketchy, but\r\nshopping there is a good way to pick up a few\r\ncapsule tickets.
kinopad_topics_txt_04_03_2	\r\nIf you're tricky, you can also use the coin-hungry\r\nThwomps to your advantage.
kinopad_topics_txt_05_00	The Warp Box is obviously useful when you have\r\ntwo people going for the Star at the same time.\r\nBut there are other uses to consider!
kinopad_topics_txt_05_00_1	\r\nA Warp Box can also come in handy when crossing\r\ndangerous areas or helping teammates in hard-to-\r\nreach spots.
kinopad_topics_txt_05_00_2	\r\nIt could even provide a way to stomp multiple\r\nopponents at the same time to steal lots of coins.
kinopad_topics_txt_05_01	Each board in Partner Party has special items\r\nunique to that board. Find them before\r\nthe rival team to gain the advantage!
kinopad_topics_txt_05_01_1	\r\nFor example, in Domino Ruins there's only\r\none treasure chest and one key to find...
kinopad_topics_txt_05_01_2	\r\nSo it's all about getting there first!
kinopad_topics_txt_05_02	When you use the Peepa Bell, consider your rival's\r\nlocation and how many allies they have.
kinopad_topics_txt_05_02_1	\r\nIf they have a long way to go to the Star or they're\r\nin a dangerous place, they're going to need to\r\ntravel quite a distance. That's the perfect time to\r\nstrike!
kinopad_topics_txt_05_02_2	\r\nRivals with lots of allies will also move greater\r\ndistances, making them good targets as well.
kinopad_topics_txt_05_03	If you want to use twice as many cards and go for\r\na big reversal, save it for the homestretch!
kinopad_topics_txt_05_03_1	\r\nThat way, not only can you get four Stars at once,\r\nif you work with your teammate to land on the\r\nStar space at the same time, you can get a\r\ntotal of eight Stars!
kinopad_topics_txt_05_03_2	\r\nThough you'll still need the coins to pay for them,\r\nof course.
kinopad_topics_txt_06_00	Think about how to combine your efforts\r\nwhen playing Partner Party.
kinopad_topics_txt_06_00_1	\r\nOne option is to stick together, land on the same\r\nspaces, and go for two coins with a solid "Yeah!"\r\nAnother possibility is to split up to make sure at\r\nleast one of you is in position to get the Star.
kinopad_topics_txt_06_00_2	\r\nTalk it over before moving to decide as a team\r\nwhat your strategy will be.
kinopad_topics_txt_06_01	Stomp on a rival and you can get their coins!\r\nYou get one coin if you stomp them while moving,\r\nbut three to five if you land on the same space.
kinopad_topics_txt_06_01_1	\r\nDon't let up on your rivals if they're about to\r\nreach the Star! If all goes well, you can ensure\r\nthey can't afford it when they get there!
kinopad_topics_txt_06_02	It's sometimes better to gather allies than to make\r\na beeline for Stars.
kinopad_topics_txt_06_02_1	\r\nPicking up lots of allies in the first half of the game\r\nwill make getting around in the second half much\r\neasier. It never hurts to think ahead a little!
kinopad_topics_txt_06_03	Don't worry if your path takes you to a space that\r\nlooks empty. Those spaces sometimes contain\r\nHidden Blocks, which might have a Star inside!\r\nFinding even one of these may put you in the lead!
kinopad_topics_txt_08_00	Have you seen the Koopa Paratroopa who likes to\r\ntake snapshots? He likes to get a picture of people\r\ngoing over the falls, so make sure you look your\r\nbest for the photo!
kinopad_topics_txt_08_01	Quake in terror as you learn of the three dreadful\r\ncreatures lurking in this jungle!
kinopad_topics_txt_08_02	First, a horrific sea monster who drags sailors into\r\nits whirlpool from which there is NO ESCAPE!
kinopad_topics_txt_08_03	Second, a terrifying river fish that can knock you\r\nhigh into the air if it crashes into you!
kinopad_topics_txt_08_04	And finally, a fearsome yet charismatic foe that\r\nalters the river's features with its unfathomable\r\npowers. If you haven't met it on the river yet,\r\nthen cross your fingers that you never do!
kinopad_topics_txt_09_00	When I play Sound Stage, I like to stand up to put\r\nmyself in the mood! Tap your feet and nod your\r\nhead to really feel the beat with your whole body,\r\nand it'll be simple to get your timing down.
kinopad_topics_txt_09_01	Don't feel like you have to overdo it when you\r\nshake ! You can use a light touch so long\r\nas the game understands the difference\r\nbetween you shaking and stopping.
kinopad_topics_txt_09_02	There are rings at each character's feet that light\r\nup at just the right moment. If you can't get the\r\ntiming right through the music, use the visual cues\r\nto help!
kinopad_topics_txt_09_03	Just because it's your character doesn't mean it\r\nhas to be you controlling them! It's lots of fun to\r\nwatch people play the Sound Stage minigames,\r\nso go ahead and pass your  to a friend!
kinopad_topics_txt_10_00	Challenge Road isn't easy to clear. If you have to\r\nquit in the middle of a stage to do something else,\r\nremember that you can continue where you left off.\r\nTake one step at a time, and put it aside if you have\r\nto. The reward at the end will still be waiting for you\r\nwhen you get there!
kinopad_topics_txt_10_01	Don't give up if you can't clear one of the spaces!\r\nIf you strike out enough times, a Toady will get you\r\npast. Any spaces you don't clear on your own will\r\nstay red in case you want to go back and challenge\r\nthem again later.
kinopad_topics_txt_11_00	Here, you can play all the minigames. It's the\r\nperfect mode for killing a little time!
kinopad_topics_txt_11_00_1	\r\nIf there's a minigame you particularly like, register\r\nit to your Favorites. It'll get a  mark, so you can\r\ncome back to it easily.
kinopad_topics_txt_11_00_2	\r\nCheck the Details if you want to know a little more\r\nabout any of the minigames. You can review the\r\nrules or see how many times you've played it.
kinopad_topics_txt_11_01	If you can't decide on a minigame to play, try the\r\nRandom option to let the game decide for you.
kinopad_topics_txt_11_01_1	\r\nIf you're in the mood for a particular type of\r\nminigame, change genres with /, and you can\r\nchoose a minigame from the list of that type.
kinopad_topics_txt_11_02	This is a simple game where you gain territory by\r\npicking panels, but it's deeper than it looks. If you\r\nget two panels on either end of a line, you capture\r\nall the panels in between them!
kinopad_topics_txt_11_02_1	\r\nIt's good to go after panels in the corners of the\r\nboard. They can't be trapped between other\r\npanels, so your rivals will have to go to extra\r\nlengths to capture them.
kinopad_topics_txt_11_03	There are four lucky +1 panels hidden around the\r\nboard for you to find. There's also a "Steal a Panel"\r\nevent in the tenth round where you can take any of\r\nyour rivals' panels, so hold out for that!
kinopad_topics_txt_11_04	In this game, you're competing for total points\r\nacross minigames. The focus is on improving your\r\nown score instead of sabotaging your rivals.
kinopad_topics_txt_11_04_1	\r\nIf you play in Custom, you can choose your own set\r\nof minigames. Get some practice in on your weaker\r\nminigames and go for a high score!
kinopad_topics_txt_11_05	You can see your own personal records so far.\r\nIf there's a minigame where your showing isn't\r\nthe strongest, try and fix that in Free Play!
kinopad_topics_txt_14_00	The Online Mariothon is a Mariothon played over\r\nthe Internet. You can choose either Worldwide\r\nMatch, where you play with rivals from all over the\r\nglobe, or Friend Match, where you face off\r\nagainst friends.
kinopad_topics_txt_14_00_1	\r\nIn Worldwide Match, you can choose from the\r\nToad Cup, Toadette Cup, or Kamek Cup. Each of\r\nthe cups offers different minigames at\r\ndifferent times.
kinopad_topics_txt_14_00_2	\r\nOnce you play a Worldwide Match, you can check\r\nyour ranking. If you haven't played it before,\r\ntry it and see how you stack up against the\r\nrest of the world!
kinopad_topics_txt_14_01	You can judge your skill at this game based on\r\nyour skill grade, which is determined by the last\r\nfive matches. The skill grades are S+, S, A, B, C,\r\nD, and E, with S+ being the highest.
kinopad_topics_txt_14_01_1	\r\nIf you meet a rival with a high skill grade of S or A,\r\ngive it everything you've got! Your skill grade\r\ndepends on how well you do, so if a rival is able\r\nto outscore you, your skill grade could suffer.
kinopad_topics_txt_14_02	Another way to check your rival's strength is to\r\nlook at how many gold, silver, and bronze medals\r\nthey've earned. If you meet a rival with lots of gold\r\nmedals, you're in for a tough match!
kinopad_topics_txt_14_02_1	\r\nYou can win stickers by participating in battles.\r\nIt's something to look forward to if the thrill of\r\nvictory isn't enough for you!
kinopad_topics_txt_15_00	Here's a few pointers on hitting the ball! Move the\r\nbatter left or right to align with the pitcher's\r\nposition. That way, it'll be easier to get your timing\r\nright, and maybe you'll hit a home run!
kinopad_topics_txt_15_00_1	\r\nKnowing how fast the pitch is coming helps make it\r\neasier to hit. You can tell how fast the pitch will be\r\nby checking how tight the pitcher's spring is wound!
kinopad_topics_txt_15_00_2	\r\nThe rest is up to you, but a good way to improve\r\nis to practice the timing of your swings while\r\nyour allies are batting in team games!
kinopad_topics_txt_15_01	The most important thing is to work together!\r\nThe more people you have pushing the blocks,\r\nthe faster they'll move. Try and get everyone on\r\nthe same page before you start pushing!
kinopad_topics_txt_15_02	The key is to bank shots toward the target! Use the\r\npipes and walls to try and surprise your rivals.\r\n\r\nHit an opponent's shot with one of your own and\r\nthey'll both cancel out! You can then use that\r\nopportunity to fire at them from the front.
kinopad_topics_txt_15_03	The matching banana is around somewhere!\r\nLook carefully at the number of bananas or which\r\nway they're bent.
kinopad_topics_txt_15_04	There are a lot of secret play styles in Toad's\r\nRec Room. Check them out and try them all!
kinopad_topics_txt_19_00	Here's the lowdown on stickers.
kinopad_topics_txt_19_00_1	\r\nDid you know you can get stickers from Birdo in\r\nthe plaza? She doesn't just hand them out to\r\nanybody, but go give it a shot if you see her.
kinopad_topics_txt_19_00_2	Another solid way to get stickers is to participate\r\nin a Worldwide Match in the Online Mariothon.\r\nIf you haven't picked up any stickers yet, it's one\r\ngood reason to go online!
kinopad_topics_txt_19_01	You can get even more stickers through the\r\nParty Pad! Scan an amiibo through the Party Points\r\nmenu. If it's an amiibo of one of the partygoers\r\ncurrently in your group, you'll get a special\r\nshiny sticker.
kinopad_topics_txt_19_01_1	\r\nThat's the scoop on stickers!
kinopad_topics_txt_20_00	Mario and Bowser are often rivals, but they balance\r\neach other out nicely when they work together.\r\nThe stability of Mario's die compensates for the\r\nwild, all-or-nothing swings of Bowser's rolls.\r\nHere in Mario Party, the two longtime foes\r\nmanage to meet in the middle!
kinopad_topics_txt_20_01	Both Wario and Boo often get 5s or higher on\r\ntheir dice, charging forward recklessly! Their\r\ncharge might come at the expense of a few\r\ncoins, but don't worry about that. Everything\r\nwill probably be fine!
kinopad_topics_txt_20_02	Daisy and Shy Guy frequently get 3s and 4s,\r\nmaking them a reliable and predictable team.\r\nThey can't surge forward like some other teams,\r\nbut they're sure to move a good number of spaces\r\nevery turn. Highly recommended for beginners!
kinopad_topics_txt_20_03	Rosalina and Goombas are a combo that can rack\r\nup the coins! They both have two +2 Coins sides on\r\ntheir dice, so with the right roll, you can get four\r\ncoins at once. If you're not great at minigames, this\r\ncould be one way to stockpile coins!
kinopad_topics_txt_20_04	If you're keen on the same-roll bonus, Luigi pairs\r\nwell with Bowser Jr. Sure they each have three 1s\r\non their die, but there's an outside chance that\r\nyou could rocket ahead as many as 16 spaces!
