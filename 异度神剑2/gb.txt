1	*sigh* We really do need to buy\nourselves a new depth probe...
2	The ping was off by 150 peds to\nthe east. That's not gonna fly!
3	And what about the treasure, Rex?\nWas it in line with your expectations?
4	It seemed pretty solid. Didn't even\nhave to reinforce it too much.
5	Even with the labor costs, we should\nbe able to turn a decent profit.
6	Honestly, it takes you two days\nto run the structural analysis...
7	Yet somehow you can gauge the profits in an instant?
8	Don't go rainin' on my parade, Gramps.
9	You know I'm in the salvaging\ntrade for the cash!
10	A little business sense goes\na long way, all...right?
11	Whoa!
12	I didn't expect THAT!\nYou been living in this thing, big guy?
13	Rex!
14	No worries, Gramps!
15	I think we know what's for lunch!
bf01040100_ms.json
1	An entire horizon of white.
2	A sea of clouds, and at its heart, the\nWorld Tree, piercing the heavens...
3	This... This is the world we call home...
4	Alrest.
5	Story goes that when the world was young...
6	Everyone in Alrest lived on the Tree,\ntogether with our divine father, the Architect.
7	According to the tales, it was a bountiful land. And the people there\nheld the power to command even the heavens themselves.
8	They called that paradise...
9	"Elysium".
10	But then, one day...\nwe were cast out.
11	Nobody knows why.
12	Perhaps we angered our creator,\nor perhaps it was something else entirely...
13	All we know is, we were forced to leave Elysium\nto live here in Alrest.
14	Where, it turns out, life was pretty hard.
15	But, when it seemed like we would surely\ndie out, the Architect...took pity on us...
16	sending his servants, the Titans, to save us.
17	The few of us who survived settled on the Titans...\nand we've lived in harmony with them ever since.
18	But now, those Titans... *sigh*
19	are beginning to die out.
20	A-ah... The brazier does my weary\nold bones much good...
21	Want me to move it, Gramps?
22	No, that's quite all right. Leave it\nright there - a-ah...
23	Righto!
24	Not another one...\nBeen happenin' a lot lately...
25	Mm... More so than before.
26	I wonder if anyone was living there...
27	It seems not.\nAnd if there had been, they would have all left by now.
28	Makes sense...
29	Hey, Gramps, d'you think...Fonsett\nVillage will be gone too one day?
30	It would not be today or tomorrow,\nbut one day, yes, it will fall...
31	And you, too?
32	That's how it goes with us Titans...
33	There's no way around it.
34	Eventually...\nthere'll be nowhere left to live.
35	Sadly...
36	So... You Titans were born\nup there, is that right?
37	So they say, for what it's worth.
38	Mind you, I was born here, on Alrest.
39	As for my ancestors, who could say\nwhere they were born...
40	Can it really exist? This Elysium?
41	And the creator who's said to live there...
42	A land of plenty, atop the World Tree...
43	If such a place did exist, perhaps\nwe could all live in peace.
44	With no need for fighting.
45	Sure would be great...
46	For everyone...even folks in Fonsett.
47	If the divine Architect can see us now,\nI wonder what he thinks...

2	All right! Back to making money!
3	I think this haul should be enough for today.
4	Oi, Gramps! Care for a little swim\nto the Argentum Trade Guild?
5	You're planning on selling it now?\nIt's getting toward my bedtime...
6	Don't play the lazy old man with me.\nThere's plenty of sunshine left!

2	Going all right, else I wouldn't be here.
3	Fair point.\nSo which one am I unloading?
4	We can leave that until I'm done negotiating.\nShouldn't be too long!
5	Well, mooring is 15 gold per half-day.
6	I'll have your gold after I sell the\nstuff, all right? Later!

8	Bana offered to assemble\nteam of veterans for this job.
9	But this crew very picky. They want small\nelite team, and only from Leftheria.
10	That when Bana have stroke of genius!

14	A child salvager?
15	Jin, don't tell me we're gonna have to hire some\nbabysitters for this outing too.
16	What the hell? You look as much like\na kid as I do, lady!
17	At least I wouldn't wet myself at the\npromise of a measly hundred grand!

19	*Ahem* Rex, was it?
20	I implore you to excuse\nmy lady's discourtesy.
21	Dromarch! What have I told you\nabout speaking for me? Shut your-
22	Drop it, Nia.
23	Though, I do see your point...
24	In any case...
25	It should be easy enough\nto make sure...

28	What're you playing at?!
29	Well, well, well...
30	Malos!\nWhat good is it, beating up a kid?
31	You said it yourself, didn't you?\nWhat if the kid's not up to it?
32	I said nothing of the sort!
33	You did think it though, right?
34	And anyway, now we know.
35	You'll do right enough.\nThough you don't look like a Driver...
36	Where'd you learn those Arts?
37	Gramps showed me a thing or two.
38	Even when I was little, that was his\nidea of playtime.
39	Well, you've got some skill, I'll give\nyou that. Guts, too.
40	Kid, you better work hard.
41	Meh-meh-meh!\nFriends are such rowdy bunch!
42	Here is advance.
43	Use to buy what gear you need,\nthen go to dock on starboard!
44	Bana has arranged excellent vessel for you there.

2	Should be back in a day or two.\nTake it easy, Gramps!
3	That does not "about cover it"\nin the slightest!
4	Why would you take a job\nyou know nothing about?
5	You don't even know who your\nemployer is!
6	This came straight from the Chairman, remember?\nWhat more do you need?
7	Anyway, I'm off. You can take\na nap while you wait!

10	Eh?!
11	Gotcha.
12	Why, you little-!
13	Now look whose mouth's hanging open.
14	Rex, we're heading out.\nThere's no one seeing you off, right?

4	You-
5	I'll have you know I've got a name.\nIt's Nia.
6	They've started boozin' below decks.\nYou should join 'em.
7	Why aren't you there?
8	It's not that I hate it, I just really\ndon't need a headache right now.
9	Huh. Good thing you're not a salvager, then.
10	Why's that?
11	Swim like a fish, and drink like one too.\nThat's the Salvager's Code.
12	Ugh, sounds terrible. I don't\nthink I'll be changing careers...
13	Hm. Probably for the best.
14	Anyway, I bet you Drivers earn a hell\nof a lot more than salvagers do!
15	So, kid...
16	My name's Rex.
17	Hmph. OK, Rex. Why did you start\nsalvaging in the first place?
18	That there.
19	The...World Tree?\nI don't get it.
20	You know, you find all sorts of things\ndigging through salvage.
21	Some of it trash, some of it treasure...\nbut all of it from people long gone.
22	Have you noticed how there's fewer\nTitans each day?
23	I saw one go under just the other day.\nIt was a pretty big one.
24	There must have been loads of\nanimals still living on it...
25	Living space is running out day by day.
26	Sooner or later, we'll be the ones\nsinking down into the Cloud Sea.
27	But up there...\nElysium is waiting for us.
28	Pff... Bwahahahaha!
29	Seriously, kid? "Elysium"?\nDon't tell me you believe that guff!
30	It's just a lie for children, and that\nthere is just an overgrown shrub!
31	So that's, uh...why you're a salvager?
32	If there is a way to get up there,\nmaybe it's hidden below the clouds.
33	Is it really that crazy?
34	Seriously, though...
35	There'd be no need to fight over\ndwindling land and resources...
36	No need to worry about our homes sinking away...
37	Everyone could have peace and security.
38	I mean, a dream like that...\nIsn't that worth believing in?
39	Nobody can tell you what to believe, but...
40	Hmm..."Everyone," huh...?
41	What?
42	I always thought people were\npretty selfish by nature. But you...
43	Huh?
44	D'you have parents?
45	Nope.
46	When I asked Gramps, he told me they\ndied when I was just a kid.
47	"Gramps"... Oh, the same one\nwho taught you to use Arts?
48	Yeah, he basically raised me himself.
49	He's not like us, though.
50	Not like...?
51	I'm not sure I catch your drift, but\nthis Gramps of yours sounds all right.
52	[ML:undisp ]Huh?
53	And you're all right too, kid.
54	Not that different from me.

33	What's the deal with that appearance?
34	I'm guessing your goal is Elysium...

50	Oh sh-
51	What's that?!
52	Gramps!!!
53	Jin...\nStill you persist...
54	And is that...
55	Malos?!
56	Azurda...
57	Rex, get on!
58	Got it!
59	Rex!
60	We're going! Hold on tight!
61	Stop them! Open fire!
62	Turn her around! Ready the cannon!
63	It's no use. They're out of range.
64	Dammit! They gave us the slip...
65	Turn around.
66	We're not chasing them?
67	The Aegis is awakened...\nThat's enough for now.
68	I'll have Akhos hunt them down.
69	Hmph.
70	That will have to do...

1	...And so Pupunin wisely\nran away for dear life.
2	Wise? Who wise now?
3	You useless idiot.
4	Why can Pupunin not even die properly?\nWhat if they ask Bana to repay money, hmm?
5	Huh? Die? Repay who?
6	Meh! None of your business.
7	Anyway. Tell me where Rex and Blade went.
8	Rex, Titan and friends ran away!
9	Went to south of Cyclus Sea - after\nthat, Bana know as much as Pupunin!
10	Storm was very thick, so Pupunin...
11	Pupunin lose them, yes?
12	Yes, but-
13	And then run away like coward?
14	Y-yes, but-
15	Meh-meh-meh-meh-meh!\nBana not wanting feeble excuses of Pupunin!
16	Just get back here!
17	You got lot of work to do!
18	Meh-meh-meh... Even pricey insurance Bana\ntake out on Maelstrom go to waste...
19	Still, how interesting...
20	Heading southward from Cyclus Sea...
21	In current season, that likely\ntake them to Gormott.
22	You, girl! Get Consul Dughall on the line immediately!
23	Yes, sir.\nOne moment, please.
24	Why, if it isn't Chairman Bana.\nWhat an unexpected pleasure.
25	May I just say that I admire how you\nrebranded those broken Core Crystals.
26	And selling them on to the dunderheads\nback in Mor Ardain - absolutely sublime!
27	Bana did not call to hear pointless flattery!
28	And blabbering about Core Crystals on\nunsecured line?! Is Dughall some kind of idiot?
29	What if Indol tap our communication?
30	O-oh, of course!\nI'm very sorry!
31	Meh, forget it.\nWe got bigger fishies to fry.
32	Oh? What's going on?
33	Listen up...
bf02020100_ms.json
1	Unghh...
2	...Pyra...?
3	Oh, thank goodness.\nYou aren't injured at all, are you?
4	No, I'm...fine, I guess...
5	Where...?
6	I'm not certain. We seem to have\nwashed up on a Titan of some kind.
7	A Titan?
8	Ahh!
9	Where's Gramps? And Nia?!
10	We gotta find them!\nThey can't be far!
11	OK!
bf02030100_ms.json
1	Gramps!
2	It is good to see you uninjured, Rex.
3	How awful...
4	Hold on, I should have some herbs...
5	You are kind, but no amount of\nhuman medicine would suffice.
6	B-but...
7	Weep not, my boy.\nThis is my fate.
8	I...I can't help it, can I?!
9	No parting is forever. We will surely meet\nagain when the flow of the ether wills it...
10	...
11	The days with you were the best I\never had. Until we meet again, Rex...
12	Gramps!
13	Gramps!\nGraaaamps!
14	I told you not to cry, didn't I, Rex?
15	[ML:undisp ]*sob*
16	Rex...
17	[ML:undisp ]*sob*
18	Rex...
19	Graaamps!
20	Reeeex!
21	Whaaaat?!
22	[ML:undisp ]Wha-?!
23	G-G-Gramps? How is that-?
24	It can't be...
25	Use your eyes!\nDon't you recognize me?!
26	Um, well...not really, no.
27	I am so confused right now...
bf02030150_ms.json
1	So you see, by maximizing cellular regeneration\nto retain all vital bodily functions...
2	I seem to have reverted to a larval stage.
3	Well that's quite handy.\nMust be nice to be a Titan!
4	This isn't something just any old Titan can do!\nOnly one so advanced as myself-
5	Erm, Rex, are you angry?
6	Hmf! I'm not.
7	...It's more that I didn't want you\nto see me blubbering like a baby!
8	Ho ho.\nIt's okay to be angry.
9	So when will you be back to your old self?
10	Good question.\nNo more than 300 years.
11	Th-three hundred years?\nBut I'll be long dead by then!
12	Hmm. I suppose that's true.
13	But...what about my house?!\nDo I have to live on the streets?!
14	Perhaps this is an opportunity to fly the nest.
15	You mean...pay rent?
16	Ho ho, miserboots!
17	It's a massive extra expense!
18	Still... Glad you're OK, Gramps.
19	Oh, shoot! We can't stand around all day!\nWe have to find Nia!
20	Nia? You mean that Driver\nand her Blade from before?
21	Yeah. They kind of saved our lives.
22	I do hope they are all right.
23	Gramps, do you remember anything?
24	I remember crashing through many\ntrees before landing here...
25	They probably fell off then.
26	Hmm, that's not a whole\nlot to go on...
27	Perhaps we would have some luck\nfollowing the trail of broken trees?
28	Good thinking, Pyra!\nLet's go!
29	By the way, Rex, is that a Core\nCrystal I see shining on your chest?
30	Just what happened to you?
31	I'll tell you later. Right now\nwe need to find Nia!
32	Ohoh! Now this makes a nice change!
bf02040100_ms.json
1	What's that sound?
2	I felt a ripple in the ether. It feels like\na Driver is using a Blade in battle.
3	I'm certain of it!
4	Let's go!
5	OK!
bf02050100_ms.json
1	My lady, leave this to me!
2	I'm not just going to abandon you, Dromarch!
3	[ML:undisp ]Wha-?!
4	We're here to help, Nia!
5	Rex?! What're you doing here?
6	My lady, now's our chance! Let's attack!
7	All right, then!
bf02060100_ms.json
1	So why are you guys even...\nWell, I guess that's a stupid question.
2	Indeed.
3	Seriously, it's good to see you. And you're all right.
4	Right back at you.
5	Hey, by the way. What happened to the big guy\nwho saved us? The Titan?
6	Are you talking about me?
7	Wait, what? How?
8	That's sort of a long story.
9	Let's get somewhere we can rest.\nI'll tell you all about it then.
10	That seems prudent. My lady?
11	Sure. Lead the way.
bf02070100_ms.json
1	I see. So you two are off to Elysium.
2	Listen, I never thanked you properly.\nFor saving us, I mean.
3	Dromarch said that you...\ncarried us all the way here.
4	We owe you our lives, Titan.
5	No need to thank me. After all,\nyou were the ones who saved Rex.
6	Don't mention it.
7	So you Titans can regenerate.\nPretty handy.
8	This isn't something just any old Titan ca-
9	You can retire that line now.
10	Excuse me?! I'd like less of that attitude!
11	If you had listened to me and declined that reckless\njob to begin with, we wouldn't be in this mess!
12	"Take a nap" you said, like I was\nsome kind of doddery old man...
13	Okay, okay, I get it!\nI'm a terrible disappointment.
14	Look how sorry I am!
15	Can you not muster even a\nshred of sincere remorse?
16	Sorry, but I can't.
17	What?
18	If I hadn't taken the job, they'd have\ngot their hands on Pyra.
19	Rex...
20	I couldn't let that happen. No way.\nThey can never take her.
21	...
bf02080100_ms.json
1	Hello there. Still awake, I see.
2	I can't seem to sleep.
3	It's good to see you again...Azurda.
4	Likewise. Though you've changed\na lot since last we met, Pyra.
5	I suppose I have. A lot's happened.
6	Yes it has. I wanted to thank you for saving my dear Rex.
7	And I need to know - what you told\nhim, is that what you really intend?
8	Yes.\nIt is my true desire.
9	I see. Well, that's good enough.\nI have no reason to doubt you, Pyra.
10	That said...\nI do have one other goal now.
11	Jin and Malos.
12	I cannot allow them to continue\nwith their current course.
13	The fate of an Aegis never changes...
14	Right...
15	And you're going to get Rex mixed up in this?
16	...
17	I'm not blaming you.
18	No matter how hard you tried, that boy\nwould find some way to get involved.
19	I see half your Core is missing.\nSeems you've taken on quite a burden.
20	Azurda, I...
21	Promise me you'll take care of Rex.
22	I will.
bf02090100_ms.json
1	[ML:undisp ]*yawn*
2	Right then. We should probably\ntry and find a town or something.
3	Does anyone have any idea where we are?
4	This is Gormott.\nA province of the Ardainian Empire.
5	You must've seen the Gormott Titan before?
6	Yeah, only from a distance, though.
7	We're somewhere around its belly.
8	So...this is Gormott, huh?
9	Hang on a second, Nia - your ears.\nAre you Gormotti?
10	Well done, genius. Took you long enough!
11	Gormott is the land of my lady's birth.
12	Wow. Well, that's reassuring.
13	If we wanna find a town, the first\nstep is to get out of this forest.
14	Keep heading up and we'll hit the\nplains soon. The town's that way.
15	Brilliant. Let's get going!
bf02100100_ms.json
1	Oh my goodness. What a wonderful view!
2	Spectacular indeed.
3	Yeah, this is great! Especially after slumming it\non Gramps's back for so long!
4	Hmph. It served you well enough!
5	Over there, that's Torigoth. Biggest\ncity in Gormott.
6	I'll accompany you as far as the city.\nAfter that, I'm afraid you're on your own.
7	Oh... On our own?
8	Of course. I would have thought even you'd know\nwhy I can't be seen with you.
9	Because you're supposed to\nbe one of them?
10	I haven't known them very long, but you know.\nThey're still my crew.
11	Your crew? Even after they tried\nto kill you?
12	That's as may be, but they're the\nclosest thing I have to a family.
13	Nia...
14	Right! Let's go.
bf02110100_ms.json
1	So, this is Torigoth...
2	It hasn't changed a bit.
3	Nia?
4	It's nothing.
5	OK then. I'll show you to an inn.\nThen I'm out of here.
bf02120120_ms.json
1	What the bloody hell is this?\nDon't tell me this is meant to be ME?!
2	A remarkable likeness to say the least...
3	Oi, did you say something?
4	Ah, er, no. I fear they may have conflated\nour countenances, my lady.
5	How very awful.
6	Grrrr! Hisss!
bf02120140_ms.json
1	Fie! Who has the courage to heed the Empire's call?
2	Your strong heart today\nwill build a strong Mor Ardain tomorrow!
3	Of course, you get more than a salary!\nPension and benefits are included!
4	Distinguish yourself and you could even join the nobility!
5	For the glory of the Ardainian Empire\nand His Majesty Emperor Niall!
6	Come now! Who wants to be the hero of tomorrow?!
7	Hmm... What's the deal over there?
8	Driver recruitment.
9	Driver recruitment?
10	Recently, they've been recruiting Drivers from all over.
11	The pool of potentials is ever shrinking.\nThey must have run out of candidates in the military.
12	What do you mean by "potentials"?\nI'm not sure I follow.
13	Just see for yourself.
bf02120160_ms.json
1	Don't do it, bro, it's too dangerous!
2	What will we do if something happens to you?\nWho'll look after us?
3	P-please...
4	I-I know it's dangerous.
5	But if I can b-become a Driver...
6	Outta the way, pipsqueak!
7	[ML:undisp ]Oof!
8	All right, c'mon Blade boyo! Show\nme whatcha got! Hrooagh!
9	A-a-a-aaaah!
10	Yeah, he's done for.
11	Indeed.
12	Waaaah!
13	Oho, all bark and no bite!\nWhat a shame!
14	Eurgh, what just happened?\nAll that blood...
15	Couldn't handle the Core Crystal's power.
16	That's what happens when someone\nunqualified touches a Core Crystal.
17	Truly lamentable.
18	Wait, you need a qualification to be\na Driver?
19	Perhaps "aptitude" would be a better\nword.
20	Aptitude?
21	Now, is there nobody else here...
22	ready to test their strength\nfor the glory of the Empire?!
23	Oh! How about you? What say you?\nStep forwards, sir, with bold heart!
24	Noo!
25	Don't... Don't worry.
26	Your big bro's gonna be a Driver,\nand then we'll be set for life.
27	Don't do it!
28	Ah-aah-ah-aaaaaah!
29	There's your "aptitude".
30	You did it!
31	I don't believe it!
32	Oh wow!
33	I...I did it!
34	The Core Crystal turned into...\na weapon?
35	That is how Blades are born, Rex.
36	What? But when I touched Pyra's...
37	She's a special case.\nPyra is the Aegis, remember?
38	So the usual rules don't apply.
39	All that business with sharing her\nlife force... It's not exactly normal.
40	Wait, what does "the Aegis" even mean?
41	Jin and Malos... They called her that, too.
42	Dunno. All I know is that it's\nsome kinda legendary Blade.
43	Why don't you just ask her yourself?
44	Let's go. No point sticking around for the\nenrollment ceremony and all that boring stuff.
bf02130100_ms.json
1	This whole thing with Core Crystals,\ntouching them to create Blades...
2	It's pretty amazing when you think\nabout it.
3	We Blades start out formless, anchored\nto the world only by our Core Crystal.
4	Only the touch of a potential can\nimbue us with form and being.
5	And it is by those forms we come to\nbe known.
6	So you see, my boy, in some ways it is\nonly the fated touch of a Driver
7	that allows the Blades to\nexist at all.
8	Wow...\nWhy does it happen that way, though?
9	Now that is something no one knows.\nIt's just how it's always been.
10	Blades come in all shapes and sizes.\nSome human-shaped, some not.
11	Some people say the shape depends\non the kinda person the Driver is.
12	The resonance between Blade and Driver\nis a mysterious thing.
bf02150100_ms.json
1	Pyra... She was crying when I met her.
2	Was she brought to life by someone\nonce, just like a normal Blade...?
3	What is the Aegis, really?
4	Halt! Nobody move!
5	Oh dear... Looks like imperial troops.
6	Great.
7	Hey, what's going on?
8	That fugitive in your company is an\nenemy of the state! A member of Torna!
9	Nia, a member of Torna?
10	It's her all right. Gormotti Driver,\nwhite beast-form Blade.
11	She looks exactly like the wanted poster!
12	What wanted poster?
13	See for yourself!
14	Wow, it really does-
15	Oi, watch it!
16	Ah, uh, I mean, no way!\nThis doesn't look anything like...
17	Wait, we've got no time for this!
18	Who cares if it looks just like her?
19	*hiss*
20	Hmph. Now as for you...
21	You look like a Driver too. Registration number?
22	5...3...9...?
23	Knock it off, you fool.
24	All new Drivers must register with Indol!
25	No number means you must be\nan illegal, unregistered Driver!
26	No, you don't get it!
27	You're coming with me! We'll see what\nthe consul has to say about this!
28	Rex, Dromarch and I are gonna make our\nmove. Get ready to run.
29	We're not leaving without you.
30	This is our problem, not yours.
31	I'm pretty sure he wants to arrest all of us.\nSo this is my problem, too!
32	Sheesh, you're a stubborn one, ain't you?
33	Gramps says the same thing.
34	OK, we go on three.\nWe'll go left, you go right.
35	OK!
36	Just give the word!
37	OK, let's do this!
38	Y-you're going to resist?\nSeriously?
39	One...two...
40	A-All right, men! We've got them outnumbered -\nmove in and take them down!
41	THREE!
bf02160100_ms.json
1	They're...so strong!
2	Such strength from a measly two fighters...\nThey're Drivers, all right!
3	Rex! Now!
4	You got it!
5	Wha-?! A wall made of fire?!
6	Such a commotion.
7	Just when I thought I could enjoy a little\npeace and quiet.
8	L-Lady Brighid!
9	Brighid?\nIs she a Blade? Wh-where's her Driver?
10	My Driver is otherwise engaged at present.\nI am here alone.
11	No...Driver?
12	Ba ha ha!
13	Lady Brighid is the "Jewel of Mor Ardain"!\nThe strongest Blade in the Empire!
14	Even alone, she's more than a match for you!
15	Lady Brighid, these miscreants are\nterrorists working for Torna.
16	Please lend me your power to bring them to justice!
17	Torna?
18	That emerald Core Crystal...\nCould it really be true?
19	Well, well.
20	Captain Padraig, you are not to kill them.\nTake these ones in alive.
21	Roger! Men, bring the you-know-what!

9	Rex-Rex. Tora explain other reason I help you.
10	You see...Tora always wanted\nto make Driver friends.
11	Huh! Interested in Drivers, are you?
12	But of course!
13	Tora think it amazing how Driver and\nBlade join spirits together to make big power!
14	Tora really want to be sidekick of Rex-Rex!
15	Uh, you know my name is just Rex, right?\nOne Rex, not two.
16	What is point?
17	Well, nothing, I guess.\nIt just sounds a bit different from what I'm used to.
18	Doublename just show Tora's respect!\nRespect for great Driver!
19	Rex-Rex should be proud!
20	I'm not sure I've earned all that yet...
21	Oh, all right. You can call me Rex-Rex\nif it makes you happy.
22	But instead of all this sidekick stuff,\ncan't we just be friends?
23	Really?
24	Tora will be friend of Rex-Rex?!\nHooray!
25	What a funny little guy.
26	Hey, Tora! Do you know much about this town?
27	Huh?
28	You wouldn't happen to know where the\narmy takes prisoners, would you?
29	Rex, you're not planning to...
30	We have to save Nia and Dromarch.
31	I thought you'd say that.
32	Oh! You talk about Driver and Blade who were\nwith Rex-Rex before Tora's daring rescue?
33	Yeah.
34	Mehmeh... Tora would have to ask\naround town for info like that.
35	Before we do anything, time for food!
36	All of today's running around make Tora hungry.\nNeed food to help Rex-Rex!
37	I'm a little peckish too.
38	Can't we eat later? I want to find\nNia and Dromarch as soon as possible!
39	Haha! Stomach of Rex-Rex tell different story!
40	I... I can't help it, can I?!
41	Um, if it's all right with everyone,\nI could cook something?
42	Pyra? I didn't know you could cook!
43	Hehe, well as long as fire is involved, I can do almost anything!\nFry, steam, grill - you name it.
44	Whoa!
45	If you want ice cream, though...\nYou might have to find someone else.
46	Well, you can't have everything.
bf02220100_ms.json
1	Oh man! This is delicious!
2	Yum-yummy!\nSo super very tasty!
3	Simply exquisite!
4	I haven't eaten this well in 120 years!
5	Glad you liked it!
6	It seems like I did OK...\nI was worried I'd have gotten a little rusty over the years.
7	It didn't taste rusty at all! Uh, I mean...
8	But Tora is curious.\nPyra is fire-using Blade, yes?
9	When Tora broke that water pipe,\nPyra could still make fire!
10	Come to think of it, you're right.\nThat Brighid, the imperial Blade...
11	She used fire abilities just like Pyra,
12	but the water seemed to\ndouse much of her strength.
13	So...what are you saying?
14	This world full of elemental energy called ether, yes?
15	Ether come in forms like fire, water and wind.
16	While battling, Drivers and Blades both draw power from ether.
17	But fire not good with water.
18	Other Blade woman got splooshy with water,\nso fire powers all damp.
19	But Pyra and I were able to use our\npowers with no problem.
20	Indeed. They were unaffected.
21	Why?
22	Um, well, my powers\ndon't come from fire.
23	Mehmeh?! If powers not fire,\nwhy look like flames?
24	Th-that may be a little complicated\nto explain...
25	Go on then? Tora like\ncomplicated things a lot!
26	Ah, well, u-um, I, it...
27	Knock it off, Tora. Can't you see\nyou're making her uncomfortable?
28	Meh...
29	Everyone has things they'd rather\nnot talk about. Right?
30	I'm sorry. I'm sure I'll be able\nto tell you about it soon enough.
31	Don't worry about it.
32	Right now, we need to think about how to rescue Nia.
33	First, we go around town and find\nall information we can!
34	Hmm, yes. I daresay that we're all wanted\ncriminals by this point.
35	Pyra sticks out like a sore thumb.
36	I'm so sorry.
37	Don't worry friends!\nTora has an idea!
bf02230100_ms.json
1	Special Inquisitor Mòrag! To what do\nwe owe this extreme pleasure?
2	Had we but heard of Your Grace's visit\nwe could have prepared a suitable...
3	I don't stand on ceremony, Consul.\nI'd rather you just did your job.
4	Y-your Grace?
5	Someone of your standing deserves\nto be treated as such!
6	You are His Majesty's representative!
7	Please permit us to lay on a meal\nbefitting Your Grace.
8	Until then, we would be honored if-
9	You made impressive time. I wasn't\nexpecting you until tomorrow.
10	L-Lady Brighid!
11	If we have found the Aegis then\nthere is no time to waste.
12	But I fear the passage has taken its toll on our engines.
13	The Aegis? H-how do you-?!
14	Is there a problem, Dughall?
15	N-not at all, Your Grace.
16	Good. Now, you've captured a Driver from Torna.
17	I am going to speak with her.
18	Wha-? Why do you want-
19	Dughall.\nI don't remember asking for your opinion.
20	Y-yes, Your Grace! I'll take you to\nher right away!
bf02240100_ms.json
1	Hmph.
2	So, you are the Torna ruffian.
3	I must say you look a little\ndifferent from your poster.
4	A LITTLE different?! Whoever drew that should be the one in jail!
5	Hah. Yes, I would be angry too.
6	You can drop the friendly act.
7	You won't name your friends?
8	My friends?
9	I'm not so sure I'd call those\ntrigger-happy Torna goons "friends".
10	I see. I think we have our wires crossed here.\nI am not talking about Torna.
11	Huh? You're not?
12	No. I was referring to your more\nrecent traveling companions.
13	The Driver boy and his Blade.
14	Rex and Pyra?
15	Well. That was easy.
16	(Dammit!)
bf02250100_ms.json
1	This looks like it could\nactually work.
2	Good idea, Tora!
3	Right! Let's look for friends of Rex-Rex!
bf02260100_ms.json
1	Nia and Dromarch, executed...\nIt doesn't bear thinking about!
2	But getting aboard that warship will be\nno mean feat.
3	We're going to need an ironclad plan.
4	Army port is under heavy guard...
5	I guess we'll just have to mount a full-on attack!
6	No, Rex! We can't put everyone in danger.
7	Right, sorry.
8	There!
9	This is one of the Grandarbor's\nroots, right?
10	If this map is correct, it goes all the way from the\nquay to the hull of the warship.
11	And here. It looks like some kind of cargo entrance.\nCould we sneak on that way?
12	Oh, right! No one'll spot us if\nwe sneak in from below!
13	Security light around this entrance.\nAt night, not even workers here.
14	Looks like this is our only option.
15	Then it's a plan!
16	Mehehe.
17	Tora?
18	Tora have something to show you.
bf02270100_ms.json
1	What's this then...?
2	Nobody ever see this before.\nSecret of Tora!
3	An artificial Blade!
4	An artificial Blade?
5	I can't believe it.
6	Tora have always wanted to be Driver of Blade.
7	But Tora...\nTora has no potential to awaken Core Crystal.
8	How could you know that?\nSurely you just have to try, and-
9	[ML:undisp ]Ohhh.
10	You did, didn't you?
11	Yes, one year ago, Tora applied\nto Driver recruitment man.
12	Oh deary me.
13	Oh Tora, you mean you...?
14	It was bad. Tora had nosebleed for\nthree days!
15	Just a...nosebleed?
16	What you mean, "just"?!\nPeople die from loss of blood, you know?!
17	Yeah, but from a nosebleed?
18	Anyway, moving on...!
19	For a near-death experience,\nyou're awfully casual about this...
20	ANYWAY! Back to Tora's Blade.
21	When complete, even no-potential Tora\ncan be a Driver!
22	This is simply incredible. You built\nthis Blade from scratch, Tora?
23	Hm, it was started by Grampypon and Dadapon.
24	But Grampypon die, and Tora still not\nknow where Dadapon go to...
25	Oh...
26	So Tora will finish Blade myself and\nbecome a Driver like always wanted!
27	Then Dadapon hear about Tora's\nsuccess and come back home, yes?
28	Oh, Tora...
29	By the by, Tora, this Blade...
30	As far as I can see, it looks complete.\nWhat is there left to do?
31	Mehehehe! All Tora have left to do\nis buy missing parts!
32	But Tora have no money at all!
33	Oh? Really?
34	Really.
35	Nothing? At all?
36	Not even one gold...
37	So you're asking for a loan?
38	Uhh, not...loan, hehe. Um, closer to...\ngenerous...donation!
39	Just like a Nopon. Always\nshrewd when it comes to gold!
40	B-b-but if Tora completes artificial Blade,\ncombat capabilities will be big help on mission!
41	Well, yeah, if it works you may have a point...
42	So...how much exactly do you need?
43	Oh...no more than 60,000 gold...?
44	Sixty thousand?!\nD'you want a kidney as well?
45	Calm down, Rex. I think we owe Tora our help.
46	If it's just money he needs,\nI may be able to assist.
47	Assist? How, exactly?
48	Nothing illegal, I hope!
49	Don't even joke, Gramps!
50	This is a natural crystal.\nIt should fetch around 60,000.
51	No way! We can't let you sell that!
52	But-
53	No, it wouldn't be right!\nThat's it, I'm paying for the parts myself!
54	Very admirable.
55	Meh meh!\nRex-Rex is too generous!
56	This Blade of yours had better be\nseriously useful, though, Tora!
57	Leave that to Tora!
58	Well, then, let's go, I guess!
59	Yippee!
60	Will they really be OK?
61	I suppose they'll have to be...
bf02280100_ms.json
1	OK! All finished!
2	It's really complete?
3	Very complete!
4	Just need to apply energy charge to activate!
5	Tora, our friends' execution draws near.\nThere's no time to lose.
6	Make haste!
7	I know, I know! Okay artificial Blade,\nit's wakey-wakey time!
8	That won't do, Tora!
9	W-what Tora do wrong?
10	You can't keep calling her "artificial Blade"!
11	As her creator, the least you can\ndo is give her a proper name.
12	Oh, um, well...
13	Actually, friends, Tora did think of name for her.\nVery good name.
14	Nice. Then I guess there's no problem.
15	Well, why don't you introduce us, Tora!
16	Right away!
bf02280150_ms.json
1	Now... Wakey-wakey!
2	Tora's very own Blade! Poppi!
3	P-Poppi?
4	★How may I be of service, Master?★
5	W-w-w-wait a minute!
6	Ooh! Forget you see that!\nTora must change the settings! Khm...
7	The settings?
8	Th-this time should be OK...
9	Second time go best! Powerrrr...on!
10	Greetings, Masterpon.
11	I...I did it!
12	Tora's masterpiece! World's first\nartificial Blade...Poppi!
13	Whoa!
14	Incredible!
15	That is really quite something.
16	Tora did good, huh? You impressed?\nTora is a very big success?!
17	Absolutely! You're amazing, Tora!
18	Though I was pretty surprised before,\nwhen she was all...you know...
19	Forget about it! That not Tora's fault!\nTh-that was, um...
20	Grampypon! Grampypon Soosoo made settings!
21	Yes, definitely Grampypon's fault!
22	Are you sure, Tora?
23	Y-yes, Grampypon...yes...
24	Mehmeh!
25	Well, let's not dwell on that. Rex!\nLet's go rescue Nia and Dromarch!
26	No time to lose!
27	Mehmeh...
28	Anyway, my name Poppi.\nPoppi try hard to make Masterpon proud.
bf02290100_ms.json
1	Grr...
2	That shrew thinks she owns the place, just\nbecause she curries favor with the Emperor...
3	If only I'd got the Aegis myself...
4	I could have returned home in triumph,\nor sold her to Bana for a tidy sum...
5	But it's not over. I refuse to\nlet this place be the end of me!
6	I will not be left to rot in this\nflea-bitten backwater!
7	Captain Padraig!
8	Uh, yessir!
9	Double the number of guardsmen!\nRound up whoever you can find!
10	We're going to find that Aegis\nbefore Mòrag gets her paws on her.
11	Sir! As you wish, sir!
12	Watch and learn, Mòrag Ladair.
bf02300100_ms.json
1	There is Titan warship!
2	Mmm. Quite the impressive Titan.
3	Another sign that Mor Ardain is readying\nonce more for war with Uraya.
4	Look! That root goes right to the\nship, just like Pyra said.
5	Yes yes!
6	We should be able to climb down\nover here. Let's go!
7	OK!
8	Off we go!
9	Understood.
bf02310100_ms.json
1	Looks pretty high.
2	Gimme a moment.
3	Pyra, you first.
4	I'll pull you up, so hold tight.
5	Gh... So...heavy!
6	Wh-what did you say?!
7	[ML:undisp ]SURPRISED NOISE
8	Yow...
9	Now look here, Rex.\nYou can't just go and call a lady heavy.
10	Ooh, Rex-Rex a little tactless...
11	Sorry about that, I guess I was just surprised!
12	No no, it's not your fault, I-
13	She heavier than Tora for sure!
14	But that just mean Pyra grown\nto impressive height!
15	It is good thing!\nPyra should be proud!
16	Poppi pull Pyra up.\nPlease grab again.
17	Niiiice, Poppi.
18	Poppi artificial Blade.\nThis is...noooo problem.
19	Poppi could lift Gonzalez if necessary.
bf02320100_ms.json
1	Masterpon, Poppi can feel there is a Blade in the vicinity.
2	But how can Poppi tell that?
3	Unclear. Poppi feel\nother Blade like wave in air.
4	Huh. I'm not sure I get it, but...\nmaybe Dromarch is nearby!
5	Let's try opening up some of these doors!
bf02320130_ms.json
1	[ML:undisp ]*grunt*
2	Umm...I didn't hurt anyone, did I?
3	Everyone check your eyebrows!
4	I'm sorry! It's hard to judge the\npower sometimes...
5	Pyra! Rex!
6	Dromarch! It's good to see you alive.
7	It very good!
8	See, Masterpon? There was a Blade here.
9	Master Titan and... Forgive me,\nbut who are they?
bf02320150_ms.json
1	Dromarch, we don't have much time.\nDo you know where Nia is?
2	But of course. We are in resonance after all.\nI feel her presence.
3	Then let's go! We can't let\nher get executed!
4	Indeed. This way!
bf02330100_ms.json
1	No doubt about it, that's the place!
2	Who are you people?!
3	They're the terrorist's friends!
4	We are her friends!\nBut I won't let you call her a terrorist!
bf02340100_ms.json
1	Titan warship - Nia's cell
bf02360100_ms.json
1	Ahh!
2	Jin?
3	You all right, Nia?!
4	Rex, you...
5	My lady. Apologies for my late arrival.
6	Don't mention it. I didn't think\nanyone was coming at all.
7	As if we'd leave you!
8	"Always help those who help you."
9	That's the second rule of\nthe Salvager's Code!
10	Well, that's you all over, ain't it.
11	Rex-Rex! Tora has found escape route!\nHurry hurry!
12	A Nopon?
13	He has been of some assistance.
14	We made a new friend!
15	Uh, nice to meet ya.
16	Well, I think we've overstayed our\nwelcome here. Time to get moving!
bf02370100_ms.json
1	Not much further to exit!
2	Not so fast, my dear intruders.
3	Letting a terrorist from Torna out of my grasp\nwould make me look very bad indeed.
4	Ah, that emerald Core Crystal!\nYou must be the Aegis!
5	Much as it pains me to admit it,\nit seems Mòrag was right on the money.
6	You know who Pyra is? Are you trying\nto capture her too, you ratbag?
7	Now now, language. But of course.
8	The most powerful Blade in all of history,\nwith the power to rend Alrest asunder?
9	Only a fool would know of that power\nand not seek to claim it!
10	And I am no fool!
11	Therefore, I will claim her as my own!
12	You cannot argue with such logic!
13	Flaw detected in final step of logic.
14	Sorry, pal, but you've done all\nthe capturing you're gonna do today.
15	Such impertinence for a dirty terrorist.
16	Let's go, Pyra!
17	Got it!
bf02380100_ms.json
1	That coward...\nHe's just hiding behind his Blade!
2	What? Does common sense elude you?\nA Blade can regenerate from any injury!
3	Whereas if I die, my Blade\nwill return to a useless core!
4	So it's OK to use them as a living shield?
5	You weasel. Even if they can regenerate,\nthat doesn't mean Blades don't feel pain!
6	Hahah, how cute. The fleabag thinks we\nshould care about Blades' feelings.
7	Heeheehee, I wonder if YOU can feel pain!
bf02390100_ms.json
1	How...? A mangy fleabag and a bunch\nof stinking kids...
2	My triumphant return...to Mor Ardain...with the Aegis...
3	Out like a light.
4	That's what he gets for trying to execute Nia.
5	What?\nHe was trying to take me back to Mor Ardain.
6	Rex, this is a trap!
7	A trap?\nSo they weren't actually gonna execute you?
8	No time! Talk later, Rex-Rex! We should escape!
9	Masterpon is right.\nChance of reinforcements very high.
10	Let us make haste. Getting out of\ntown would be a good start!
bf02400100_ms.json
1	These flames again!
2	It's her!
3	And with her Driver too, this time.
4	That's Mòrag, the Flamebringer!
5	Mòrag?
6	Special Inquisitor Mòrag of\nMor Ardain.
7	The most powerful Driver in the Empire...\nand wielder of Brighid, the most powerful Blade.
8	So together they're, like...\nULTRA powerful?!
9	It looks like they were waiting for us.
10	Yes indeed. I did feel like we got away a little too easily.
11	I don't know why I expected Dughall\nto slow you down at all.
12	It was you, right?
13	You're the one who spread the rumor that I was going\nto be executed, just to lure Rex and the others here!
14	You catch on quickly.\nYes, you certainly proved useful.
15	However-
16	Rex and Pyra are the real prize.
17	Hah, not quite.
18	The emerald Core Crystal is the sign of\nthe Aegis.
19	If that Blade is indeed the Aegis...\nthen there's something I must do.
20	What do you mean?
21	The power to sunder Alrest itself...
22	I cannot allow that to happen again.
23	Pyra...destroyed the world?\nDon't be so stupid!
24	You mean you didn't know? Five hundred\nyears ago, during the Aegis War...
25	The Aegis sank three continents\nto the Cloud Sea's bed.
26	Three Titans...destroyed?
27	I speak naught but historical fact.
28	I'm onto you! You want to use\nPyra as some kinda weapon!
29	We're not gonna let you do that!
30	That is precisely the kind of\nscenario that I mean to prevent.
31	And what if we resist?
32	Then I will have to restrain you by force.
33	In that case, I'll make this nice and clear.
34	You. Will.
35	Never! Take her!
36	Hah. Then let's see if you have the\nstrength to back up those words, boy!

bf02420100_ms.json
1	I don't think they're following us.
2	Perhaps we're safe for now.
3	You're right. We should get some rest.\nI can't go any further.
4	Ahh... Tora is pooped as well... *yawn*
5	See you later.
6	[ML:undisp ]-Uh?
7	We are grateful for all you've done.\nWe wish you well on your travels.
8	Farewell.
9	I want to reach Elysium!
10	What?
11	I made a promise.\nI'm taking Pyra to Elysium.
12	It's just... She gave half of her life to save mine.\nI owe her.
13	Rex-
14	But half the world seems to be after her.
15	With the Titans dying off,\nliving space is running out...
16	That's gonna start wars. And people need weapons\nto fight wars.
17	That's why they want her.
18	...
19	If I can prove Elysium exists, maybe I can\nstop the war that's coming.
20	But...\nFighting Mòrag taught me something.
21	I'm not strong enough.\nI can't do this alone
22	Nia - you're a Driver.
23	We could really use a companion like you...
24	...if you wanted?
25	Elysium? Do you really believe in that myth, kid?
26	Well, Pyra told me that she was born there.\nYet here she is.
27	So it must exist, right?
28	Your logic is almost as good as Dughall's.
29	Listen, Rex, I don't know if you're stupid or\njust too nice for your own good.
30	But what if Pyra's just lying?
31	What if this is all an act, and one day she turns\nround and stabs you in the back?
32	Pyra wouldn't do that!
33	Of course I wouldn't! I don't have a knife.
34	So...serious... She...\nBwahaha!
35	An emerald Core Crystal is the\nsign of the Aegis, huh...?
36	Sure, why not. This could be interesting.
37	Really?
38	My lady!
39	I kinda wanna see this Elysium for\nmyself now. Maybe it really does exist?
40	It does!
41	An endless field of green among the clouds, eh?
42	If the legends are true, even people like me...
bf02430100_ms.json
1	Ouch!
2	Ah, I'm sorry. Did I wrap it too tightly?
3	It's fine! I'm fine! See?\nI can swing it like this and it doesn't even-
4	Owowow! Ugh!
5	I knew it.
6	Thanks! I feel much better now.
7	I'm sure that's Nia's poultice doing its job. Thanks.
8	Pyra, you're hurt too? Are you OK?
9	I'm fine. It's just a scratch.
10	Hey, let me help.
11	Thank you, Rex.
12	No worries. Least I can do.
13	There, all done! How's that?
14	Looks good. Um, Rex?
15	Look. They're the same.
16	Oh, uh, yeah.\nI guess they are.
17	[ML:undisp ]*giggle*
18	So beautiful.
19	Yeah, it really is.
20	I guess that's probably because\nyou made it, Pyra...
21	Huh?
22	Ahh! No, what? I didn't mean it like that!
23	You're just, erm, really good at making fires... That's all.
24	It's what I do.
bf03020100_ms.json
1	Welcome home, Jin.
2	Hey, Akhos.
3	I hear the Aegis awakened. Nasty shock for you?
4	Or was it...?
5	Of course, my script showed how\neverything would play out from the start.
6	Sure, you say that once it's all over and done with.
7	It's easy to act smug when hindsight's on your side!
8	Shut your mouth, Obrona!
9	I'm shaking to my core.
10	Where are the other two?
11	Mikhail's inspecting the Ardainian "factory"...
12	And my beloved sister is\nout hunting, as always.
13	I'm sure she'll have found plenty of\nDrivers to chew up and spit out by now.
14	She likes to hunt, all right.
15	Not sure we can use all of those\nCore Crystals though...
16	Do we know where the Aegis is right now?
17	Have no fear, Jin!
18	Of course we know her whereabouts!
19	Obrona?
20	Yeah, yeah...
21	Hm! It seems they're currently traveling\naway from the urban area of Gormott.
22	Leaving the town? But there's nothing out that way...
23	Perhaps they're on their way out of Gormott itself.
24	Oh, and...
25	What?
26	It seems a certain shipment has set out.
27	The Core Crystals heading to Indol\nfor cleansing, huh? How pious of them...
28	Shall we handle them?
29	I can deal with that myself.\nYou concentrate on the Aegis.
30	Understood.
31	Well, I am looking forward to clapping\neyes on the Aegis...
32	By the way...what of Nia?
33	You know where she is?
34	Yes. Look. This dot here.
35	Without a doubt, this is Dromarch's wavelength.
36	It seems they're traveling together with the Aegis.
37	With the Aegis?
38	[ML:undisp ]ADLIB
39	Do as you see fit.
40	Understood.\nYou don't need to ask me twice.
41	Right then. We're gonna take the Monoceros.
42	Hm. As you wish.
43	Hey!
44	Don't do anything too reckless.
bf03030100_ms.json
1	What is that?
2	A Cloud Sea compass.
3	A must-have for salvagers.\nIt's sort of a map of the Cloud Sea.
4	If you do this... And this...
5	What's the date today?
6	Um... Amathatober 5th, 4058.
7	OK! So now we put the date in...
8	See?
9	This is very clever.
10	Looks like Gormott is the closest\ncountry to the World Tree right now.
11	All we need is a ship...
12	The army has every ship in town in its grip.
13	*sigh* We're kinda stuck...
14	Seems that way.
15	Sorry I'm no use now...
16	I know, I know.\nBut I'm all out of ideas.
17	Rex-Rex need ship?\nTora have good idea!
18	You do?
19	There is ship builder living\nat Gormott Titan's bum-bum!
20	Old friend of Tora's Grampypon.\nHe called Umon!
21	Maybe he help if we tell him what's what!
22	Sure, it's worth a shot!\nLet's get going.
bf03040100_ms.json
1	Hellooo! Umon! Umon?!\nWhere is Umon?
2	Who is that?\nWho is noisy while I do my work?
3	Tora! This big surprise!
4	Long time no see, Unclepon!
5	Yes! Long time!\nAbout one whole year?
6	Yes, about that!
7	You became very big in one year, Tora!
8	Yes, Tora not littlepon anymore.
9	And Tora have lots of sidekicks!
10	Rex-Rex and friends are not Tora's sidekicks!\nThey are real friends, Umon!
11	Rex-Rex! Meet Unclepon Umon!
12	He did great research with Grampypon!\nHe is great builder of ships!
13	Hello!
14	Greetings.
15	At your service.
16	I see! Tora's friends!\nTora has lots of friends. Very good!
17	Tora has become fine biggipon.
18	Hehehe!
19	Well, Tora. Did you need Umon's help for something?
20	Well, we wanted to borrow a ship.\nFrom Unclepon Umon!
21	A ship? But there are lots of ships in\nTorigoth!
22	Why hike all the way to bum-bum to see me?
23	Oh...erm...well...
24	Tora run out of gold, hmmm?
25	Umh... Yes! Tora spend all the gold\non artificial Blade!
26	Tora flat broke, like penniless\npancake.
27	I wanted to go on a little boaty-jaunt to, ah...\nnearby place. But no money to go on boat!
28	Hmmph. I hope Tora can keep track of\nall of these fibs he's telling...
29	There's no other option.
30	We can hardly tell him what happened in Torigoth, can we?
31	Yeah, I guess you're right...
32	So long as we get a boat out of this...
33	Artificial Blade, eh? Was this what\nTora's Grampypon was working on?
34	My name is Poppi.\nPleased to meet Unclepon.
35	Yes! This it!
36	This pretty mighty!\nTora take after Grampypon indeed!
37	Oooh, well...\nHow can I refuse Tora now?
38	Tora may use Umon's ship but there is problem.
39	Wh-what is problem?
40	You see, ship not quite ready just yet.
41	Not much left to do! But work\nstop, because no building parts.
42	That's the only problem?
43	Correct! But that is big problem.\nBig like sea or mountain.
44	You mean, all you need is some parts,\nthen you can finish the ship?
45	It just as you say, friend.
46	So, if we go and find the parts, then you'll...
47	Of course! I make ship ready.\nThen you borrow!
48	Thank you!\nCome on everyone, let's go!
49	Yay!\nLet's go find ship ingredients!
bf03040150_ms.json
1	So now we borrow Unclepon's boat!
2	Thanks, Umon! We owe you!
3	Indeed!\nEnjoy your boaty-jaunt!
bf03050100_ms.json
1	So that's the World Tree...
2	Wow, I've never seen it so close before...
3	Me neither, to tell you the truth.\nBut it's just as awesome as I'd hoped.
4	The current's really strong...\nFall in that, and you're a goner.
5	It's great that we made it this far...\nBut how do we get over there?
6	Any ideas?
7	Pyra?
8	We...
9	Huh?
10	Rex! We need to leave!\nWe can't stay here!
11	What, why?\nWhat are you talking about, Pyra?
12	Ophion!
13	Ophi-who?!
14	Quick!
15	Uh? Gotcha!
16	Ophion! Stop this!
17	What's wrong? Can't you hear me?
18	It can't be!
19	What was that?\nThought we were done for!
20	[ML:undisp ]?!
21	Is that...
22	Uraya's Titan!
23	This is NOT good!
24	Ack! Here it comes!
25	Aaah!
bf03060100_ms.json
1	Aaah!
2	[ML:undisp ]
3	Pyra! Anybody!
4	I...I'm here.
5	You hurt?
6	No, I'm fine.
7	Ach, ow.
8	Meehh...
9	Looks like we're all OK...
10	Except for the fact that we now\nfind ourselves in the belly of the beast.
11	The beastie's belly?
12	This is the inside of the\nUrayan Titan.
13	Meh meh!
14	Look.
15	Tora think this not nice place.
16	Is that how we're gonna end up?
17	Hey, Rex! Don't jinx us!
18	Everyone. Shouldn't we try to get out of here?
19	If I recall, the Urayans live\ntowards the beast's back.
20	There must be a way up there.
21	Yeah. Can't hang around here, for sure.
22	Over there.
23	Huh?
24	Poppi see something over there.\nSomeone coming this way.
25	For real?\nMaybe you're just seeing things.
26	Poppi is certain.\nSomething is flickering over there.
27	Flickering...you say?\nSome kind of ghost maybe?
28	S-shut up! There's no such thing!
29	Nia! You're not scared, surely?
30	D-don't talk nonsense, Rex!\nI'm not a kid!
31	You're scared!\nAt last. Something Nia's scared of.
32	Just you watch... Hey!\nWhere's Pyra?
33	What?
34	Pyra's missing.
35	Uh... But she was right here.\nPyra? Pyra?!
36	Hey, what's up?
37	Aaah!
38	H-hey, what's the big idea?!\nDon't wander off like that!
39	Nothing really. I was just taking a look around.
40	What's the matter?
41	Heheheh.
42	What's so funny?
43	Oh, nothing...
44	Titan's foot!
45	Oh! Things are looking brighter\nalready.
46	Poppi can help too.
47	Now even more brighter!
48	You two are certainly earning your\nkeep.
49	*Sigh* I wish I could say the same\nfor old Dromarch here!
50	Apologies, my lady.
51	See? Not so scary when you can actually see.\nLet's find the exit!
52	Yeah!
bf03080100_ms.json
1	There's some kinda dim light...
2	If I remember, the Urayan Titan has a translucent hide...
3	I bet that'll be the light filtering through.
4	So the Titan must be above the clouds now?
5	I dare say!
6	If we can make it to the source of the light,\nmaybe we'll find a way out of here.
7	Hold it!
8	Looks like a bunch of mushes I ain't seen yet.
9	You gotta have pretty damn bad luck,\nending up in a Titan's guts like this.
10	...Huh? That Blade...
11	An emerald Core Crystal!
12	[ML:undisp ]*gasp*
13	Bwahahahaha!\nSo the rumors are true!
14	Huh? What rumors?
15	The tale that every Driver worth his salt knows.\nThe legendary Aegis.
16	Folks been saying she just woke up from\na 500 year nap.
17	Wouldn't have thought she'd show up with a\npencil-neck shrimp like you for a Driver, though.
18	You think I don't have what it takes?
19	Nah, I mean...\nMaybe you could handle a normal Blade.
20	But a greenhorn like you with a beaut like her?\nDon't kid yourself.
21	C'mon boy. Hand her over to a grown-up.
22	This crap is getting old.
23	Leave her alone!
24	Y'got heart, kid. I like that.
25	Yew, Zuo, you take care of the others.\nI wanna squash the kid.
26	Heheh. Leave it to us, boss.
27	We'll take real good care of 'em.
bf03090100_ms.json
1	What's the matter?\nAre you the Aegis or aren't ya?!
2	Huh?
3	Something feels different...
4	This man, he's...
5	That all ya got, mate? Pathetic.
6	We'll show you!\nWe'll show you what me and Pyra are made of!
7	He dodged?!
8	Course I did, kid.\nAny slower, you'd bore me to death.
9	How about this then?
10	Hmph.
11	Rex, wait!\nI can't supply power this fast!
12	Nowhere left to run!\nEat this!
13	[ML:undisp ]Uh?
14	Playtime's over. Take this!
15	[ML:undisp ]
16	Ah!
17	Hah! If you're a Driver, you're a new one for sure.
18	Drivers, see.
19	We borrow our Blades' energy...\nchannel it into our weapons...
20	And let rip with an Art!
21	But you gotta be careful - there's a limit to it.
22	If you go in all bull-headed like that, kid,\neven that Aegis of yours...
23	is gonna run out of energy before long.
24	W-what...?
25	H-huh?
26	The name's Vandham.
27	I run a little firm out of the nearby village.
28	A..."firm"?
29	Come on!
30	I'll treat you to some grub as thanks for\nletting me take a whack at the legendary Aegis!
31	Bwahahahaha!
32	Just then... I realized while we were fighting...
33	I sensed from the very start that\nhe didn't mean us any real harm.
34	Hm, he sure is a strange old goat, that one...
bf03110100_ms.json
1	Helluva story.
2	So you headed to the World Tree to reach\nElysium, but got swallowed up whole instead?
3	You got some crazy luck.
4	So, er, what were you doing back there, then?
5	Y'know, this Titan...\nIt ain't too fussy about what it eats.
6	I went down there to see if anything we\nmight need in the village washed up.
7	But mostly I only found your sorry mushes.
8	Yeah, sorry about that...
9	Here we are.\nWelcome to Garfont. Ain't much but it's home.
10	The village has a lot of children.
11	Lots of Drivers and Blades here too!
12	We're in the business of dispatching Drivers\nand Blades all across the world.
13	Most of the kids are war orphans.\nTook 'em in while on the job.
14	So you're saying that you\ntake them under your wing.
15	Just till they're able to make it by themselves.
16	Some of 'em might grow up to be\nDrivers, like ourselves.
17	...But then others might become tailors.
18	It doesn't matter what they wanna do with their lives.\nWe leave it up to them to decide.
19	Aye. Us "Justice Busters" just wanna help.
20	Good eggs, huh?
21	You said it.\nI've been called worse.
22	Come on. Let's eat!\nAll this egg-talk is making me hungry.
bf03120100_ms.json
1	I'm going to get some water.\nVandham?
2	Cheers love! Gimme a beer!
3	Beer? Coming right up!
4	What's up? The grub don't suit you?
5	So do you fight in wars too, Vandham?
6	You got a problem with mercenaries?
7	Are you trying to get us to join up?
8	Hah!\nShrimps like you? We're not THAT desperate.
9	Relax.
10	OK. Good to know.
11	Hmmm...
12	Rex, you're a salvager, ain't ya?
13	Yeah.
14	You musta fished out your share of\nmilitary supplies, right?
15	You fine with that?
16	Nah. I don't wanna get involved with it.
17	It's all the same.
18	Compasses, valves for ether stoves...\nArmies need all these things.
19	That bread you're eating? It's made from ruska\nflour. Supplied by the Ardainian government.
20	This world's full of war.
21	Don't matter if you're a soldier or\nnot. As long as you're alive...
22	...you're in the war, some way or another.
23	Don't you think?
24	Um, I...
25	Life can be cruel.\nCrueler than you know.
26	That's why I set up this little band,\nso I could protect the people I care about.
27	Rex. You're the Driver of the Aegis.
28	The whole world's gonna try and scalp you,\nyou realize that?
29	How ya gonna live, when you got\neveryone gunning for ya?
30	It'd be easy to run.\nAll you'd need to do is ditch that girl.
31	...
32	Hmmm...
33	C'mon! Gotta get ready!
34	Wh-where are we going?
35	Just follow me, kid!
bf03130100_ms.json
1	We just got a job to go check out some kinda crazy energy effect.\nSomewhere up around the blowhole.
2	Whaddya say?\nFancy bein' a mercenary for a day?
3	Um, OK?\nBut, I mean, we don't work for free...
4	Don't worry, kid, you'll get paid.
bf03130150_ms.json
1	[ML:undisp ]gasp at the sight of the weird miasma
2	An ether miasma.\nTake it this is your first one.
3	Ether miasma?
4	It's a load of poisonous waste\nproducts spewed from the Titan's guts.
5	Y'know when you get gassy?\nKinda like that.
6	Erm, is there a way through this thing?
7	I can't see any way round it.
8	Hey. No fear.
9	Roc, mate! You're up!
10	Miasma's died down!
11	Heheheh!
12	Yup, nothing to it.\nLet's roll!
bf03140100_ms.json
1	An Ardun...\nJust what we need.
2	Rex, any good with that anchor?
3	Yeah, I get by.
4	Hand that here.
5	Now watch.
6	Awesome!\nI never thought of using it that way!
7	The trick is to pull it taut at just the right moment.
8	Now you try!
bf03150100_ms.json
1	You got it after seeing it once.\nNot bad, kid.
2	Heheheh.
3	Listen up, kid.\nDrivers use Arts.
4	But that doesn't just mean using\nthe powers your Blade gives you.
5	There are Arts that use your own strength,\nor take advantage of your enemy's.
6	There are all sorts.
7	A Driver's job is to be smart with his\nArts, and protect his Blade.
8	Protect my Blade?
9	Yeah. It's a two-way thing, kid.
10	You gotta be aware of the power comin'\nout of her.
11	Don't waste it, channel it through\nyour Arts, and protect her.
12	If you can do that, then you're a\ntrue Driver, kid.
13	'A true Driver'?\nI don't know... Am I ready?
14	'Course you are.
15	That thing from before?\nTook me five years to learn that.
16	Five years?!
17	Yeah. But you saw it once, then\nyou aced it like it was nothin'.
18	And, you got Nia and Tora in tow.\nThose guys are pretty handy.
19	Kid, you got a bright future.
20	I think I'm gonna spew.
21	Biggipon has scary face, but he very nice!
22	Bwahahahaha!\nSussed me out, furrypon!
bf03160100_ms.json
1	Like I thought...
2	A Titan?
3	So that weird power effect they clocked...\nMaybe this is the cause?
4	Yeah, sure looks like it.
5	I'll hazard it wasn't death by old\nage, either.
6	Might have been an accident...\nOn the other hand, it might have been attacked...
7	Hey, look! Seems like this Titan dying\noff has stirred up something else!
bf03170100_ms.json
1	The Blade returned to its core...
2	So that monster was in resonance\nwith the Blade...
3	Tora cannot resonate, stinky monster\ncan resonate. Not fair!
4	But Masterpon have Poppi...
5	Oh, Poppi!
6	If a Blade loses its Driver, it winds\nup like this.
7	So, is it, like...dead?
8	Nah! The crystal'll start glowing again after a bit of time.\nThen a new Driver can resonate with it.
9	But...
10	There's a but?
11	Its memory will be totally zapped.
12	It'll be reborn as a new Blade.\nWon't remember a thing.
13	Yeah?\nThat's pretty rough...
14	To have all of your past wiped out\nlike that...
15	But memories can be...painful as well.\nThey can be a terrible burden.
16	And, a Blade can live forever, as long\nas the crystal exists.
17	It's just as well. Eternity is a long\ntime to collect bad memories.
18	Pyra...
19	I'm sorry.
20	I was just thinking, sometimes\nbeing able to forget is a...blessing.
21	C'mon! Let's get finished up here!
22	That's...
23	A Core Crystal!
24	What?!
25	Well, that where they come from. Out\nof Titans.
26	This one's brand new and ready to resonate.\nLike a big steak, right before you take that first bite.
27	It'll probably end up buddying up with\na bunch of Drivers...
28	Every time the Driver dies, it'll forget everything and return\nto its core. Eventually it'll resonate with a new Driver.
29	Drivers dyin', Titans dyin'...\nThe Blade just keeps on livin' through it all...
30	It's a never-ending cycle.\nAn eternal history.
31	As mortals, we'll never be able to understand.
32	It's incredible.
33	But... Pyra already had a\nbody when we found her...
34	Could her old Driver still be alive somewhere?
35	Perhaps...
bf03180100_ms.json
1	Owowowowow...ah...
2	Hey, hold still.\nI thought you were a tough salvager, Rex!
3	Gimme a break. Pain is pain, isn't it?
4	How about you? Are you hurt?
5	Don't worry, it's just a scra—
6	Ouuuch!
7	That was on purpose!\nYou were hurting me on purpose, weren't you? Well?
8	I wasn't, honest!\nI was just rubbing the lotion in...
9	Rex! You rubbed it too hard!\nIt hurts, see!
10	Waaah!
11	Hey, you two!
12	Gimme a look at that!
13	What is this...
14	Haven't seen this before...
15	Dunno why a Blade would be stuck with\na bunch of wounds...
16	And they're exactly the same as Rex's!
bf03180150_ms.json
1	Incredible.\nNever heard of such a thing.
2	It's all true.
3	I just thought it was an accessory.
4	Vandham, that's not my style.
5	Blades are supposed to heal up right\naway, no matter what the wound.
6	If the crystal's in one piece and the\nDriver's alive, nothing can touch 'em.
7	So why's she all bashed up?
8	That's just how the chips fell.\nIt is what it is.
9	What it is, is a problem.
10	It means, if one of you kicks the\nbucket, you both do.
11	You told me that a good Driver always protects his Blade.
12	So that's what I'll do. I'm gonna protect her.
13	Easier said than done, kid.
14	Listen.
15	Pyra... She saved my life, brought me\nback from the dead. So I won't die again!
16	I've got to live, for her sake!\nUntil we get to Elysium, at least.
17	We can make it together.
18	Rex, you mean...
19	Going to Elysium? I can't let that\nstand.
20	It won't do.\nA bunch of amateurs stealing the show?
21	The script exists for a reason!
22	Akhos!
23	!
24	Please speak only when you're spoken\nto, traitor.
25	Traitor traitor traitor!♪
26	Nia, you're one of the baddies now.\nYou villain!
27	Teeheehee!
28	I didn't betray anyone!
29	Then why do you stand with them?\nYou think that is where you belong?
30	But, I...
31	Hmph. Who are these goons?
32	Torna. They're trying to get their hands on Pyra.
33	Torna?!
34	Akhos!\nJust tell us what you're here for!
35	Well, the Aegis, of course.
36	I just had to come and see the leading\nlady with my own eyes.
37	Jin put you up to this?
38	Well deduced.\nOh, by the way...
39	His orders were to deal with you\nin whatever manner I see fit.
40	So you know what that means.
41	He wouldn't...\nYou're lying!
42	Why the surprise?\nDid you think he would still care about you?
43	Oh, to live in your reality...
44	[ML:undisp ]Grrr!
45	Well, well. Your part in this play is\ncoming to an end.
46	So! Time for you to shuffle off the stage.
47	Hnngh!
48	What's wrong?
49	I know the name Torna. They've taken\nthe lives of too many Drivers.
50	Including some of my crew. Good people.
51	Rumor says it's because they're collecting\nCore Crystals. So, if this Akhos is one of them...
52	Yew! Zuo! Get everyone out of the village!
53	Yes, sir!
54	You ready?
55	Ready!
56	Got it!
57	Thanks for this.
58	No problem!
59	It'll be tough. His Blade, Obrona...\nShe can manipulate the ether in the air.
60	It lets him counter elemental attacks by\ngenerating fields of the opposing element!
61	Finally, a decent opponent for a change!\nLet's go!
bf03190100_ms.json
1	Such an honor!\nSharing a stage with the legendary Aegis!
2	Argh!
3	Ugh!
4	Huh? Why would the Driver...
5	It seems...that they're taking each\nother's damage, somehow.
6	Ah! So that means that the Aegis...
7	Is a mere mortal right now...

5	Hey, Rex...
6	[ML:undisp ]Hmm?

8	Well, he's a bad guy, trying to get\nPyra...and you're...not?
9	Hehe! Thanks for the\nvote of confidence, kid.
10	What if I told you that we weren't\nthat different?
11	Huh?
12	My crew at the village, we think we're\nfighting for justice.
13	But, a just fight? I'm tellin' you now, there's no such thing.
14	What people call justice? It's just an excuse to fight.\nWar is war.
15	The more you stand up for yourself,\nthe more people wanna fight you.
16	Before you know it, you're in a war.
17	Listen. All I'm saying is, we got our fight,\nand he's got his.
18	But what he's doing is-
19	Yeah, it's bad. But war ain't about right and wrong.\nPower. That's all it is.
20	And power can take many different forms.\nIt depends on the heart of its wielder.
21	If we don't use our power, just 'cos\nwe're scared of it, we're done for.
22	As for who's right and who's wrong...\nNo one knows for sure.
23	So, all we can do, is protect what's\nimportant.
24	I think I understand.
25	We all got our own war, kid.

14	Nia originally said she was going to go alone.

4	Yeah, we don't muck about with\nour Titans much. No need for it.
5	Urayans like things pretty natural.

25	There was...? Really?

18	Good. I was worried that you\nmight not...wake up...

21	You called yourself "Mythra"?
22	What? I - I, um...
23	I'd like to hear that, too.\nThat power...it wasn't normal.

1	Malos and I are Aegises.
2	Blades born with a terrible power,\nstrong enough to destroy the world...
3	Malos is another Aegis?!
4	Long ago...
bf04030120_ms.json
1	There was a man who climbed the World Tree,\nhoping to make it to Elysium and meet his creator.
2	But...when he arrived at Elysium, he found it empty.
3	So instead, as proof that he had\nreached that divine realm...
4	He brought back two Core Crystals, Malos and me.
5	And once he made it back to Alrest...
6	he awakened Malos.
7	Why he did it, I can't say.\nFor greed...for power...
8	or perhaps...
9	When Malos awakened, he wielded his\nworld-shaking power without restraint.
10	To him, it was natural.\nHe had never known anything else.
11	I was awakened by a Driver who was\ndetermined to stop Malos's rampage.
12	So Malos and I fought.
13	I fought with all my might, and\nsucceeded in defeating Malos.
14	But not without a price. Three great\nTitans fell in the struggle.
15	After the battle...
16	I sealed myself away to ensure that power\nwould never be unleashed again.
17	I took the form you see now,\nand fell into a long slumber.
bf04030170_ms.json
1	That was five hundred years ago...
2	The Aegis War.
3	The man who awakened Mythra was Addam,\nhero of the lost Kingdom of Torna.
4	Addam fought as Mythra's Driver\nto protect the world from Malos.
5	We Titans played our part\nin that battle, too.
6	It is our calling to live\nalongside humanity, after all.
7	Gramps...?
8	Addam hid Pyra's sleeping body\ninside a great ship...
9	And sunk her to the Cloud Sea's floor,\nwhere none could abuse her power.
10	So that day, that's the ship that we...
11	That's how Pyra and I...
12	I believe...it was fate\nthat we met each other.
13	Otherwise, my sister would\nnever have woken up.
14	You call her...your sister?
15	Mythra and I used to talk together,\nin that dream of Elysium where you met me.
16	We promised that, when we were awakened again,\nwe'd go home to the real Elysium.
17	And then, we would fulfill\nour real purpose...
18	And that's...defeating Malos again?
bf04040100_ms.json
1	I'm very sorry about Mythra.\nShe didn't mean all that.
2	You have to understand, she came out\nbecause she wanted to protect you.
3	She broke her own seal for you,\neven used her power as the Aegis...
4	The flame powers I use are\njust a shadow of her strength.
5	Droplets of excess energy,\ntrickling through the seal...
6	Don't worry about it.\nShe was right. This was all my fault.
7	I'm just glad...
8	Huh?
9	That you've finally managed\nto open up a little!
10	Also, thank you!\nFor protecting everyone, I mean.
11	Protecting? Me?
12	Your powers are incredible.\nI could feel the truth behind the legends!
13	I'm sorry... I...
14	You apologize a lot, you know that?
15	I guess you still feel guilty...
16	about the Aegis's power, right?
17	But I...don't want you to have to\napologize any more.
18	I hope I can help you move past that...
19	No, I know I can!
20	Rex, I-
21	Power depends on the heart of its wielder...
22	That's what Vandham said.
23	That's why your power is the power to protect.
24	The power to keep everyone safe and smiling.
25	I want to do the same. I'm gonna be the kind\nof Driver who can protect you in turn. I promise!
26	Make a girl cry? That's not gonna fly.
27	Make a girl smile? You pass the trial!
28	That's the third rule of\nthe Salvager Code! Yeah?
29	Rex-Rex! Can you help Tora\nwith repairing of Poppi, please?
30	OK! I'll be right there!
31	Oh yeah - what's for dinner tonight?
32	How does Meatball Pot-au-Feu sound?
33	Delicious! Mm, I can't wait!

2	Take it and go to Indol.
3	That dagger's owner will\ntell you how you can get to Elysium.
4	This is...a Blade weapon, right?\nWho's its owner?
5	The man who was once my Driver.
6	Your...Driver? Huh? But then...
7	Cole is a Blade.
8	We fought together in the Aegis War.\nYes... His real name is Minoth.
9	Blades not get old though.\nWhy Cole look so old?
10	Because I'm one of the cursed ones.\nA Flesh Eater.
11	[ML:undisp ]!
12	A...Flesh Eater?
13	A Blade who has been\nfused with human cells.
14	A long time ago, before the war, some sought\nto test the limits of Blades' potential.
15	I am a product of their experiments.\nOne of the unlucky ones who was tainted by their folly.
16	Why would ancient people do that?
17	It seems that by combining\nBlade and human...
18	It is sometimes possible to create Blades\nwith extremely unique powers.
19	But only very rarely. Most experiments\nwere failures, and I was no different.
20	I gained nothing at all, and lost my immortality to boot.\nI likely won't last much longer.
21	Grandpa...
22	Before I go, I want to see where your\npath ends. That dagger will aid you.
23	Will you do this for me?
24	Of course! Oh, but can I ask\nyou to do something too?
25	Namely?
26	I was wondering if you could\nwrite a play about Vandham.
27	About Vandham?
28	Yeah. I think his story could\ninspire a lot of people.
29	Once I find Elysium, I'll come see you\nagain. Show it to me then?
30	An interesting notion...\nPerhaps that is the least I can do.
31	Very well, I'll do it. So see you make it\nback here in one piece, understand?
32	Absolutely. You have my word!

8	So...if I resonated with it now...
9	Then a new Roc would be\nborn into this world.
10	A new Roc...
11	Vandham's Blade...
12	What do?
13	I'm not sure.
14	Taking Vandham's old partner...\nIt just doesn't feel right.
15	Yeah, but maybe he would have wanted you to do it.
16	Just do whatever.
17	Right...
18	Probably time we headed for the ship, right?
19	Oh - yeah.
20	I'll go ahead and register\nus for boarding.
21	Nia, do we really need to rush?
22	Sure, we could take our time.\nAnd miss out on the good seats!
23	Oops-
24	Oww!
25	What was that kid's problem?
26	Rex! Your bag!
27	[ML:undisp ]Huh?
28	No... No! Nooo!
29	What've you lost now?
30	Roc's Core Crystal!\nIt's not here!
31	You mean that little blighter...?!
32	After him! At once!
33	Titan's foot!
bf04120120_ms.json
1	That little thief looked\npretty young, right?
2	Yeah. And those ears.\nGormotti for sure.
3	So let's see...
4	There! That's the brat!
5	Whoa!
6	Ugh! What d'you think you're doing?!
7	Why, that little...!\nHe stole the whole ship!
8	What now?!
9	Let's go!
10	Are there any other...
11	There's one!
12	Garram!
13	Hey, Rex.\nWhat's the big hurry?
14	Lend me your boat!
15	What? I mean, sure, but why?
16	There was a pickpocket! Took\nour Core Crystal! Over there!
17	Over there?
18	Hold it!\nBring that ship back here!
19	Why, that's Pittman's ship!
20	Your thief's on board that thing?
21	Please!
22	All right, then! The key's in the\nslot, so you can take her right out!
23	Thanks! I'll bring her back\nas soon as I can!
24	No worries! Go get 'em, Rex!
bf04120130_ms.json
1	That the ship!
2	Yeah, no doubt about it.\nThis is where he got off.
3	He may still be somewhere nearby.
4	Right. Then let's ask around\nand see what we can find!
5	Good plan!
bf04120140_ms.json
1	If we're on the right track,\nhe should be around here, yeah?
2	Thief using Umon's workshop\nas hideout...
3	I never dream of such a thing!
4	That's him.\nLet's surround them so he can't run.
5	Gotcha.
6	Ahh! You lot!
7	Kid! You sure led us on a merry chase.
8	You've wasted a lot of our time, you know.
9	Dammit!
10	Look at you. You're only kids.\nWhy don't you just give back what you took?
11	We'd rather not hurt you or anything.
12	You're basically a kid yourself!
13	Oi, I'll have you know I work for a living.
14	Right, hand it over.
15	N-no! You're not having it!
16	The Core Crystal is ours now!
17	If you want it so bad, you'll\nhave to take it by force!
18	Well, nothing for it, I guess.\nAll right! Let's go!
bf04120150_ms.json
1	Well, we took it by force.\nJust like you wanted us to.
2	Ugh...
3	[ML:undisp ]...
4	...Titan's foot, you're all barely ten years old.
5	Why are you stealing from people?
6	[ML:undisp ]...
7	[ML:undisp ]...
8	Look, keeping your traps shut won't help anyone.
9	My lady, be a little more gentle...
10	Why? They're only petty thieves.
11	Be that as it may, they are still children...
12	Look, I'm sure there's a reason you're\ndoing all this. Are you just that hard up?
13	What do you take us for?!\nWe're not some poor beggars!
14	OK, so it's not money you're after...
15	Then what the hell is it they want?
16	You should just tell everything.\nRex-Rex not hurt you.
17	[ML:undisp ]...
18	C'mon.
19	...We want revenge.
20	Revenge?
21	We're gonna avenge our village!
22	You don't mean... You were planning\nto awaken this Blade and use it?
23	Why don't you tell us the whole story?\nWe might be able to help.
24	Bandits attacked your village...?
25	It was just a small, peaceful village. But the bad men...\nJust because we had water, they...
26	Did anyone survive?\nDon't tell me...you're the only ones?
27	What's your name?
28	Me? Why d'you wanna know?
29	Please, kid.
30	...It's Rhys.\nFrom Cordell Village.
31	Cordell Village...\nCan't say I've heard of it.
32	It's just a tiny village on the outskirts\nof Gormott. Not many people know it.
33	OK, Rhys. I get why you did this.\nBut still, it's not right to steal from people.
34	Besides which, awakening a Blade is dangerous.
35	Do you know what happens if it fails?
36	You never know until you try!
37	Long as one of us manages it, that's all that matters.
38	Sounds like you really were desperate, my boy.
39	I assume you know the whereabouts of these bandits?
40	There's a big cave over on Twin Trunks Hill.\nThey use it as a hideout.
41	Oh! Rhys! It's awful!\nThose scum are gonna-!
42	...Who are they?
43	Don't worry about them.\nWhat's the matter?
44	R-right, OK... The bandits are\nplanning to attack Torigoth!
45	Are you sure?
46	Yeah. We overheard one of their men\ntalking about it in the city just now.
47	And it was definitely one of them?
48	It looked like they were\nscouting the place out.
49	They were saying with the consul gone, now's\nthe perfect chance to take advantage.
50	A shrewd observation... This would indeed\nbe the perfect time to mount an attack.
51	Are you trying to tell me that idiot consul\nwas actually good for something?
52	So...this all our fault?
53	Well...\nYeah, I guess we might have been the trigger.
54	We can't sit by and let this happen.
55	Agreed.
56	Right, you lot! You can leave\nthose nasty bandits to us.
57	Wh-what?!
58	I swear. We'll avenge your village.
59	But...
60	Don't worry.
61	By the way, name's Rex.\nRhys, take the others and go warn the city guard.
62	Warn them about the bandits?
63	Nah, they probably wouldn't believe\nyou if you said bandits were coming.
64	So tell them about us instead.
65	Tell them the guys who destroyed the water\ntower are hiding out at Twin Trunks Hill.
66	If you say so...but why?
67	Don't worry, you'll see.\nWe're counting on you, OK?
68	OK.
bf04120160_ms.json
1	What the...
2	Well, this is quite the unhelpful obstruction.
3	Hey, isn't this the same as that thing\nwe saw in the blowhole? With Vandham?
4	Indeed, it seems to be the same phenomenon.
5	In that case...
6	Yeah. We just need a little help from Roc!
7	Vandham, mate...\nHope this is OK.
8	Rex...
bf04120165_ms.json
1	All right!
2	You really did it!
3	Roc...
4	So you are my new Driver.
5	Bit of a scrawny one, if you ask me,\nbut ah well. It's good to meet you.
6	[ML:undisp ]...
7	He talks kind of like Vandham, huh.
8	Vandham? Who is that?
9	Oh, right... You wouldn't remember,\nsince you've been reawakened now.
10	He was your old Driver.
11	My old Driver?
12	Ah, so my core was passed down to you.
13	We coulda...stolen it.
14	I didn't sense any guilt in your words.
15	Hmm...you're a perceptive one, all right.
16	Yes, you take after your old master\nin more ways than one.
17	Listen, Roc. We need your help.\nReckon you could clear the way for us?
18	This stuff? Of course.\nNothing simpler.
bf04120167_ms.json
1	Wow! That hardly took any time at all!
2	Hmph. I did say it was a simple task.
3	Thanks a bunch, Roc!
4	...Roc?
5	Tell me something.
6	My previous Driver...
7	You mean Vandham?
8	Yes, this Vandham.\nWhat kind of a man was he?
9	He was incredibly strong. He looked\nkind of scary, but he was kind, too...
10	And he saved my life.
11	It's thanks to Vandham that\nwe're all standing here now.
12	I see...
13	Then I think I'd better protect you all too.
14	[ML:undisp ]Huh?
15	To carry on my Driver's will\nas best I can...
16	That's the path I feel\nbest befits a Blade.
17	Oh, Roc...
bf04120170_ms.json
1	So what's the plan? Looks like there's quite\na few of 'em, and they have Blades too.
2	No time for complicated plans.
3	Don't worry - they'll be no match for us!
4	I knew you'd say that.
5	But hey, I'm not saying you're wrong!
6	Just remember, we're not here to kill anyone,\nso mind you don't go overboard.
7	Was Rex-Rex not going to avenge village?
8	There's more than one way to do that, right?
9	Well, if you say so.
10	Understood.
11	Right. Let's go!
12	All of you put down your weapons!\nYou're not going to harm that city!
13	Who the hell are you punks?\nWe ain't got time for a bunch of kids!
14	Hold it! They're Drivers and Blades!
15	Now I get it... The city hired you, huh?!
16	What d'you think?
17	Bah! How'd you find out about...
18	...Whatever.
19	Hey, lads! Let's slaughter these brats!
20	We'll make an example of 'em!
21	Yeah!
bf04120180_ms.json
1	Whew...
2	Well, we managed to beat them, all right.\nBut what now?
3	Ah, right on time.
4	Oh, I get it. That's why you\nasked the kids to call them here.
5	It isn't us they need to answer to. Right?
6	Leaving them to the authorities... A wise decision.
7	I suppose we should probably leave, then.
8	It's not a good idea to be here when the military arrives. Let's go.
9	Yeah, let's move!
bf04120190_ms.json
1	So you see, considering the situation,\ncould you let them off the hook?
2	Hmmm. I'd hate to deny a request from you, Rex,\nand I can see these kids've had a hard time...
3	What d'you think?
4	Well...I suppose I did get my ship\nback safe and sound.
5	Hey, how about this?
6	Make them work for the Guild, and get them\nto work off what they owe that way?
7	Wha...?!
8	These brats?
9	Are you saying...we should\nmake salvagers of them?
10	I think they show a lot of promise!\nThey've got pretty quick fingers - right?
11	Come on, you know it makes sense.\nThey're poor little orphans with nowhere to go!
12	Are you really just gonna turn them away?
13	You sure know how to twist a guy's arm...\nAll right, I'll do it!
14	I'll sort out the details with Pupunin.
15	But it's just bed and board for now, got that?\nIf you want paying, you prove yourselves first!
16	You hear that?\nI hope you don't mind...
17	Wow...
18	Right, then!\nWork hard, you rascals!
bf04140100_ms.json
1	[ML:undisp ]...
2	So this is the imperial capital...
3	Such a big city! Maybe there places selling\nrare junk parts for upgrading Poppi!
4	Time to go look!
5	Masterpon, Poppi would rather use\nnew parts if possible...
6	Meh meh! Is that you there, Tora?!
7	Have not seen Tora in long time!\nRemember me - Muimui?
8	Hm? Why random old guy know Tora's name?
9	Oh... Tora not remember me at all!
10	It Muimui!
11	I was assistant of Professor Soosoo,\nyour Grampypon!
bf04160100_ms.json
1	Ohhhh! You that old Muimui guy?
2	Of course Tora remember!\nMuimui should have said to start with.
3	...Muimui did say.
4	Oh, right! Muimui not very interesting,\nso Tora forgot he exist.
5	Tora! That's not very nice.
6	No no, I do not blame Tora.
7	Tora was very young back then.\nNot surprising he forget.
8	Besides, Masterpon was quite distracted just now.
9	Only thinking of how to upgrade Poppi.
10	Why, could it be?\nThis look like artificial Blade!
11	Muimui right! Tora studied Grampypon\nand Dadapon's blueprints carefully...
12	And finished construction!
13	Meh meh... How wonderful...
14	If only Professor Soosoo still here\nto see results of hard work!
15	Muimui, you have any idea where Dadapon went?
16	That day, when the lab was attacked...
17	Muimui was out on errand. When I got back,\nProfessor Soosoo's body was lying there.
18	[ML:undisp ]...
19	But there was no sign of Professor Tatazo.
20	I see... Even Muimui not know...
21	Do not feel down, Masterpon.\nWe will find Dadapon someday.
22	Though no evidence for this hypothesis.
23	Anyway, Muimui apologize for interrupting\nyour trip when you just arrived in city.
24	Friend of Muimui run an inn just up ahead.
25	Place with famous hot springs. If you\nlike, Muimui can try to get you discount!
26	Muimui is best friend!
bf04170100_ms.json
1	Ahhhhhh, that feels good.
2	Such wondrous bliss...\nMakes aching of journey melt away.
3	...Hang on...
4	should you even be in the bath?\nWon't you rust or something?
5	There no problem. Poppi made from\nspecial alloy. No rust or need for oil!
6	Tora thought of everything, huh.
7	Masterpon is finest artificial\nBlade maker in all the world.
8	Hey, Pyra.
9	Come on in, the water's great-
10	Wait, Mythra?!
11	Huh?!
12	Is there a...problem?
13	I... I guess not, but...
14	N-nice bod you've got there.
15	Thanks.
16	When I told her there was a hot spring here,\nMythra was dead set on trying it out.
17	So...here I am.
18	Must be interesting for you guys...
19	Anyway.\nI think I'm heading out.
20	Nia, are you...?
21	Mm, well... Yeah.
22	Do you want us to keep this quiet?
23	I'd appreciate it, yeah. For now.
24	Understood.
25	You got it.
26	Thanks.
bf04170130_ms.json
1	Whew, that was a good bath.
2	Mythra seem very pleased.
3	Well, it was my first bath in 500 years.\nI think I have the right to savor it.
4	Can you just switch whenever?
5	With Pyra? Of course.
6	Our memories are shared, so it doesn't\nmatter that much who takes control.
7	Huh. Sounds pretty handy.
8	Hey, what the hell was that?!
9	I cannot say. It sounds like\nsome kind of disturbance...
10	Let's find out. Come on!
11	...Huh?
12	...What's that look for?
13	Oh, I was just - surprised to see you...
14	You'd rather I was her?
15	I-I didn't mean it like that...
16	Hmph.
bf04170150_ms.json
1	Hey, can I ask something?
2	You need permission now?
3	Do you mind if I stay like\nthis for the time being?
4	Like this...you mean, as Mythra?
5	It hasn't been long since I woke up, and this is all new to you.\nWe need time to adjust to using my power.
6	She and I talked it over together.
7	Mythra's power is much stronger than mine, but it has its\nlimitations. It can be difficult to use in tight spaces.
8	It might be best if you get used to\nusing her in different situations.
9	I mean, I don't mind at all.\nI'd like to learn more about you, too.
10	Wh-what's that supposed to mean?\nI don't see how I'm any different from her, really.
11	Really? You can certainly be more touchy sometimes...
12	W-well, that's just who I am!\nWhat do you expect me to do?!
13	You see what I mean?
14	[ML:undisp ]...!
15	What's that smile for?!
16	No, I just thought...it's been fun lately.\nA lot's happened since meeting Pyra.
17	And now I've met you too.
18	A lot of that stuff can't have been easy,\nthough. So why the smile?
19	Even rough patches can be valuable experiences.\nIs that weird?
20	Always the optimist.
21	Gramps gets mad at me for\nbeing TOO positive sometimes...
22	More like all the time.
23	Ah! Was that over there?!
24	Looks like it.
bf04180100_ms.json
1	What the hell?\nI know we didn't miss...
2	Is she a Blade...?
3	No, look...!
4	That body's...mechanical...?
5	What the-?\nWho's that?
6	Meh?
7	L...Lila?!
8	Wait! Lila!
9	Wait up, Tora!
bf04190100_ms.json
1	Not here...\nWhere did she go...?!
2	Tora, wait.\nDid you know that girl?
3	She seemed somehow similar to Poppi...
4	It was...Lila.
5	Lila...?
6	The artificial Blade Tora's Dadapon\nand Grampypon were making.
7	Tora recognize her anywhere.
8	Masterpon, there an ether furnace\nreading nearby... Up there!
9	Lila! It is you!
10	Ether furnace reading detected.\nInitiating protocol.
bf04200100_ms.json
1	Probability of success falling.\nSwitching to strategic retreat mode.
2	Lila, wait!
bf04210100_ms.json
1	She's gone...
2	Ether furnace reading lost...\nIt seem she has escaped.
3	Lila...
bf04220100_ms.json
1	Long time ago, Grampypon Soosoo and\nDadapon Tatazo were working on her.
2	Her name was Lila...
3	Grampypon and Dadapon and Tora\nall wanted to become Driver.
4	However... Not single one of us have potential...
5	So we decide to work together\nand make artificial Blade.
6	Blade even we can use!
7	But then...
8	You must run, Tora! Take this and go!\nSomeday, you finish what we started!
bf04230100_ms.json
1	After that, Tora hide out in Torigoth city.
2	Making Poppi based on blueprints and\nether furnace Dadapon left for Tora.
3	Don't you have any idea who the attackers were?
4	Tora not know who, but they\ndefinitely wanted to steal Lila.
5	If it was Lila they were after, how'd\nshe end up here in the Empire?
6	It looked like there were\nimperial soldiers after her...
7	Tora have no idea...\nBut one thing is most confusing.
8	What's that?
9	When bad guys attacked the lab,\nLila was not finished.
10	There only one who could finish making Lila...\nDadapon Tatazo!
11	Which means...
12	Tora's father must still be alive somewhere?
13	Dadapon must be held captive by whoever using Lila...
14	You there! Don't move!
15	[ML:undisp ]!
16	Imperial soldiers...
17	You!
18	So we meet again, Driver of the Aegis.
19	Lady Mòrag, she's the one.\nThat mechanical girl took down our squad!
20	What?! Hang on a minute!
21	Where the hell'd you get that idea?!
22	Unfortunately, they cannot tell\ndifference between Lila and Poppi.
23	So...Rex, was it?
24	Rex, I'm very disappointed to find you\nstooping to such lowly crimes.
25	Lowly crimes?! What the heck?!\nI'm telling you, you've got the wrong guys!
bf04240100_ms.json
1	Your skills have improved, boy!
2	Mythra!
3	I know, I know.\nI won't use that power, OK?
4	Let's stick to Foresight for this.
5	If you really need to attack,\nI'll hand it over to Pyra.
6	Thanks!
7	The Aegis has changed. What happened to\nher appearance? Answer me!
8	You want answers, then put the swords away!\nWhat's wrong with you?
9	I'll listen to your confession while you lie defeated!
10	Rex! After this Foresight, I'll switch to Pyra!
11	Understood!
12	Impossible... He dodged it?!
13	Now it's my turn!
14	Lady Mòrag! Look at the Aegis!
15	So you can change at will!
16	Eat this!
17	...Pyra?
18	We can do this without hitting them.
19	Hah!\nIt's like you read my mind.
20	Hee hee.
21	Are you holding back on me again, boy?
22	We just don't have any reason to fight you.
23	[ML:undisp ]...
24	Enough! Both of you!
25	I know you...
26	You're from the Argentum Guild's\nIntelligence Division...
27	Lady Mòrag, stand down arms!
28	These not the ones who infiltrate\nthe facility and attack your soldiers.
bf04240150_ms.json
1	Then the culprit behind the attack...
2	...was not the artificial Blade\nstanding here now. Is that right?
3	They very similar, but not the same.\nNiranira saw her with own eyes.
4	I had a feeling we were being watched since our arrival.
5	I quite sorry for causing concern.
6	Niranira has been "auditing" Argentum Trade Guild.
7	Ah, so you were keeping an eye on us\nbecause we came in on a Guild ship.
8	How ironic that your suspicion should\nhappen to prove our innocence.
9	It appears I was too hasty in judging you. I should\nnot have attacked you so suddenly. My apologies.
10	N-no, that's fine. Nobody got hurt in the end.\nI'm just glad it all got cleared up now...
11	An apology from the illustrious Flamebringer?\nA rare reward in itself.
12	Tora still not happy! Should get year's\nsupply of Tasty Sausages as compensation!
13	Masterpon. Have some self-respect.
14	Hmm. I will do what I can within my own\nmeans to compensate you.
15	By the way, the culprit who fled the scene-\nmight I ask what manner of connection you have with them?
16	You must tell me all.
bf04250100_ms.json
1	...I see. It seems it would be best for all of us\nif we worked together for the moment.
2	Us work with you?
3	Indeed. My goal is to capture the artificial Blade\nand track down the criminals behind its actions.
4	And from what you just told me, those I seek\nlikely have Tora's father held captive.
5	Would you not say our interests align?
6	Uh...I guess so?
7	Well, it's definitely better to have her\nworking with us than against us.
8	We shouldn't take the power of Brighid,\nJewel of the Empire, too lightly.
9	If she went all out on me, even I wouldn't be able to\nhold back. And then...we'd burn this place to the ground.
10	I am honored that the Aegis herself\nthinks so highly of me.
11	You may not remember it, but...\nI've faced you a few times before.
12	Let's just say it wasn't easy.
13	Oh, really?
14	But that's a story for another time.\nWhat do you say, guys?
15	I can't deny I'd rather avoid\nmaking an enemy of them.
16	All right, then.\nSo, from this moment on I suppose we're allies!
17	For the moment, I will return to the palace.\nIf you learn anything new, please send word.
18	I will instruct the palace guards\nto allow you audience with me.
19	All right.
20	Are you sure you wish to partner\nyourself with these people?
21	Just as you were not using your full strength,\nneither still were they.
22	Yet you saw the power they demonstrated.\nHow could I not feel intrigued?
23	Drawn by your Driver instincts?
24	Something like that. And besides...
25	[ML:undisp ]...?
26	I get the feeling that, if I stay near that boy, I might\nbear witness to something quite extraordinary.
bf04260100_ms.json
1	It sound like you have quite the adventure.\nBut it good that you work things out.
2	Anyway, we'll see if we can track Lila\ndown somehow ourselves.
3	I too will see if I can find any leads.
4	No matter what,\nMuimui and friends will find Professor Tatazo!
bf04270100_ms.json
1	I see...
2	There was indeed once a factory there.\nHowever, it was abandoned some thirty years ago.
3	So you think we've got 'em?
4	We can't be certain unless we investigate.
5	Shall we go?
6	You?
7	We won't do anything reckless. If it seems\ndangerous, we'll turn back. How's that sound?
8	Hmm...
9	To tell the truth, it would be difficult for me to\ndispatch the military so quickly. Would you?
10	Sure thing!
11	Now, let me share what information I have found.
12	There are rumors about town that an esteemed\nNopon merchant is involved in this affair.
13	An esteemed Nopon merchant...
14	Chairman Bana?!
15	Well, we're currently searching the transaction records.\nIf we find anything, we will inform you.
16	Pretty busy, eh?
17	I don't deny it. I will head to the location myself\nas soon as I am able to mobilize some troops.
18	All right, then!
bf04280100_ms.json
1	So, we meet again, Aegis!
2	Oh. It's Shellhead.
3	Yes! Wait, who's "Shellhead"?!
4	As ever, your comic timing is exquisite.
5	You will address me as Zeke von Genbu, Bringer of\nChaos!
6	Or Zeke! Or THE ZEKENATOR!
7	Make your mind up.\nAnd what the hell is a Zekenator, anyway?
8	Hah! You may have been lucky last time,\nthanks to a certain unstable cliff...
9	But this time round we meet on good old terra firma!
10	If you think you can run from me a\nsecond time, you are quite mistaken!
11	Nobody did any running...\nAnd anyway, Shellhead?
12	What?
13	You answer to that now?
14	I've been wondering for a while now...
15	but what's with the cutesy eyepatch?
16	Heh... I'm quite glad you asked.
17	This eyepatch conceals a power too great for mere\nmortals to comprehend...
18	The Eye of Shining Justice!
19	I am sworn to keep it sealed until its power\nis needed to save mankind.
20	You should count yourselves lucky.\nIt would turn you to ash in seconds!
21	Whatever you say, pal.
22	He definitely isn't wearing it because he didn't\nhave the gold for a second contact lens.
23	How poor are you?!\nAnd are you THAT short-sighted?!
24	By the by, what business might you have with us today?
25	Are you thick?\nI'm here for the Aegis, obviously!
26	Listen, pal. I'm sorry, but we really don't\nhave time to play with you today.
27	So hurry on home, OK?
28	What's this?
29	Were you so frightened by our power\nthat you wet yourself, furry-ears?
30	
31	Did I WHAT? You've got a lotta nerve,
32	you one-eyed monster!
33	N...Nia?\nYou do know "one-eyed monster" usually means-

4	Once we have first thousand ether furnaces,\nwe sell them to Torna.
5	Eh? Mehmeh? But I thought this project funded\nby Roderich from Imperial Senate...
6	Was it not Senator who gave us info on\nCore Chips for Lila to steal, too?
7	That make no difference.\nWe go where profit goes.

2	Then Dadapon really must be...
3	Hmmm... What exactly are they planning here?\nWell whatever it is, it can't be good...
bf04320100_ms.json
1	Professor Tatazo! Speak, speak, you give orders!
2	If productions get more slow, maybe\nyou ready for sleep time with fishes...
3	...Reduce load on neural circuits by 20%.
4	That should improve production efficiency.
5	See? It not so hard.

20	Wonderful. They come here for you?\nYou have good friends.
21	Oh! That artificial Blade...
22	This is Poppi! Tora make her by\nimproving on blueprints for Lila!
23	Meh meh... Most impressive.\nTora must have worked hard!
24	If I may... I know there is a lot of catching\nup to do, but perhaps we should escape!
25	A very good point. Come on, Rex!
26	Right!
27	Not so fast, intruders!
28	Muimui!
29	Don't tell me...?!
30	Really, now? You actually not realize it yet?
31	Muimui give you information on purpose,\nto lure you to factory.
32	If we not want you here, you would\nnever find this place so easily!
33	Meh meh...! How dare you!
34	Masterpon is really angry.
35	Meh... Finally I have chance to\nseize precious artificial Blade.
36	Now! Take care of these intruders!
bf04330100_ms.json
1	H-how can you be so strong...?!
2	Now, we're going to need some answers.\nWhat were you people plotting here?
3	O-ordinary business!
4	We innocently mass-produce ether furnaces and artificial\nBlades, and sell to people who want them!
5	They threaten Tatazo, and force to\nparticipate in production process...
6	Dadapon...
7	And next you wanted to get your hands\non Poppi? You are a greedy bunch.
8	I knew as soon as I saw her!
9	That artificial Blade uses lost ether\nfurnace designed by Professor Soosoo!
10	That is why...
11	You quite right. Even I could never make\nsuch incredible furnace as my own dadapon.
12	...So you lured us out here to avoid\nmaking a ruckus in the city, is that it?
13	Qu-quite right, yes...
14	Muimui was part of group plotting\nto steal artificial Blades all along.
15	While he my Dadapon's assistant, he sell information to\ncontact in Guild and had them attack laboratory...
16	What?! Then it all his fault that\nGrampypon was killed?!
17	Indeed it was.
18	A contact in the Guild...\nCould it be that the one behind all this is...
19	Indeed, it is I.
20	M-Master Bana!
21	You never do finish job properly, do you?
22	You manage to lure them all this way\nand then fail to capture them?
23	Muimui very sorry...
24	But I am nice Nopon.
25	You brought not only artificial Blade\nto me, but even the Aegis itself!
26	Once I have ether furnace of Professor Soosoo...
27	I can produce even better artificial\nBlades and make a killing!
28	Then I sell Aegis too and make\nmountains of cash!
29	Then I can feast on Mushy Mushrooms for life!
30	Chairman Bana! I can't believe you would stoop to this!
31	You should show more respect after\nall the valuable work I find for you.
32	So who are you planning to sell the\nAegis to, anyway? Torna, I suppose?!
33	How you know about Torna?!
34	Wait, I remember you!\nYou one of Torna's Drivers!
35	Wh-wh-what you doing here?!
36	If you come for ether furnaces,\nthey ready in ship outside.
37	What?! You're selling THOSE to Torna as well?!
38	Not sure what is going on,\nbut I will just beat you all up.

13	Join in? By yourself?
14	His Majesty has many pressing matters to\nattend to. Besides, I'm used to working alone.
15	A Driver and Blade are one in body and\nsoul. That's their very nature.
16	You're not at full strength without him.
17	It's not so simple as all that.
18	I know I've yet to unlock the depths of your power.
19	Really? I feel like I've been giving it my all.

6	You're joking...right? What would the\nPraetor want with me?
7	The Praetorium manages every Blade and\nDriver in Alrest.

21	So the Praetor - he's Cole's Driver as well?
22	Yes...
23	Come off it - just how old is he?!

25	The Indoline do live long lives.
26	Oh right...? Well, that would explain\nwhy Cole said the dagger's owner...
27	would know how to get to the World Tree!

29	You certainly won't regret it.\nAn audience with Praetor Amalthus is an honor.
30	Ahh, hey, uhhh... W-wait a second...
31	I wouldn't buy it, Rex.\nThis is too good to be true.
32	What do you think, Mythra?
33	You noticed, right?\nAs soon as we met Cole.
34	Yes.
35	Though I had no idea that man had\nbecome the Praetor, of all things.

37	There's a lot I want to ask him.\nI want to know about what happened after I went to sleep.
38	And of course... How it is that\nyou happen to be here, Fan.
39	All right, then. I want to meet him too.
40	In fact, we might have no other choice.
bf05040100_ms.json
1	Haze...
2	Lady Mythra? What are you doing out so\nlate? Can't you sleep?
3	At this time of year, the nights can be bitter.\nPlease don't catch a cold.
4	I'm a Blade. We don't exactly catch colds.
5	Of course. My apologies.
6	Haze... You really don't remember?
7	Hm? I'm afraid you have me mistaken...
8	I am Fan la Norne, Blade to Praetor Amalthus.
9	Right. Amalthus.
10	Sorry, my mistake. You just reminded\nme of somebody I know.
11	...It is quite cold, isn't it? I might\ngo back to my room, after all.
12	Yes. Good night, Lady Mythra.
13	Night, Fan.
14	(Mythra, did you see her\nCore Crystal's shape?)
15	(I saw. That's not normal resonance.)
16	(It's not like with us and Rex, either.)
17	(I guess this is one more question for the Praetor.)
18	(Sorry... Let's change over.\nI have to think.)
19	(Sure. No problem.)
bf05050100_ms.json
1	Is it working?
2	Yes. I can hear the Blades' voices now.
3	Come with me.\nAkhos has found something very interesting.
4	Very well.
bf05060100_ms.json
1	Hey, look at this.
2	Temperantia...
3	Rumor had it that Mor Ardain were\nconducting an excavation there.
4	So I thought I should check it out, and, er...
5	It's changed a lot, but this shape...
6	That's a Judicium Titan weapon.
7	Judicium...
8	I know that name...
9	Right. It was destroyed.\nA casualty of the Aegis War.
10	And it's where the Flesh Eaters were created.
11	Is that so...
12	What now?
13	If it is a threat to us, it should be destroyed.
14	...Or, we could make use of it.
15	Damn it all, I can't believe this!
16	Hello Patroka.\nAnd a very good day to you too.
17	Don't tell me-
18	No, don't worry about that.
19	We got the goods. No problem.
20	Well, that's something.
21	So why the temper tantrum?
22	...And that's how it went down.
23	Long story short, we had to make\na run for it.
24	And you're sure it wasn't your\nether field that was disturbed?
25	A female Blade from Indol...
26	Jin...
27	It's Haze. No doubt about it.
28	[ML:undisp ]
29	Jin?
30	Mikhail, how goes the work on the Marsanes?
31	Oh, that's no problem.
32	It'll take a little longer than I\nthought, but we'll get there.
33	And Akhos - where is the Aegis right now?
34	Near the Leftherian Archipelago.
35	She's on the move, maybe on a ship.
36	Maybe they're heading for Indol.
37	Hmm?
38	Where...?
39	Temperantia.\nTo buy us some time.
40	What about the Aegis?
41	If that man gets into her head...
42	Not happening.
43	That's not how Mythra works.
44	In fact, she'll be a big help to us.
45	After all, only an Aegis\ncan open up the path to the World Tree.
46	Malos, there's a lot of work to be\ndone on what we got from the Guild.
47	You guys, stay here and help Mikhail.
48	I'll go to Temperantia. Alone.
49	Fine by me.
50	Very well. Take care of yourself.
51	That guy.
bf05070100_ms.json
1	Amazing... It looks like a mountain\nof clouds.
2	The Leftherian Archipelago.
3	Indol is currently positioned beyond\nthe Cloud Ridge.
4	It would take quite some time to sail around,\nso we'll be traveling over land from here.
5	I suppose not even a Titan ship\ncould surpass such an obstacle.
6	If we have to walk, we'd best get\nmoving now.
7	It's been a while...
8	Must be five years.
9	Rex, have you been here before?
10	It's where I grew up.
11	Me and Gramps are from Fonsett Village,\njust over the ridge here.
12	Huh, I wouldn't have pegged\nyou for a Leftherian.
13	So this is your home...
bf05090100_ms.json
1	Well, I guess it'd be quickest for\nme to lead the way from here.
2	We just need to get over the ridge, right?
3	Indeed. The delegation from Indol\nwill meet us there.
4	Roger that!
5	Will leave it to Rex-Rex!\nLead the way!
6	Ha-ha!
7	Don't get an inflated head. We're just\nfollowing the islands, you know.
8	Hey, it's still dangerous!
9	There's a lot of tough monsters\naround these parts.
10	Well, I won't deny that...
11	So how we going?
12	Err...
13	What about Fonsett?
14	What about it?
15	Will we pass it?
16	I mean, we could go that way.
17	Let's do it! I mean, let's visit your village!
18	OK, calm down.
19	Someone's rather excitable...
20	Not like normal Pyra.
21	Uh, I mean...
22	Don't you want to see the place where Rex grew up?
23	Sure, but I'm not getting my ears in a twist.
24	Actually, that's not a bad idea. That route's\nprobably one of the safest we could take.
25	How about it?
26	I'll leave the decision to you.
27	Then let's do it! We'll head off\nas soon as we're ready!
28	Yeah!
29	Hey, what are you still doing here,\nanyway?
30	I volunteered to come along.\nI'm acting as a representative of the Empire.
31	Is there a problem?
32	No, not at all.
33	The Praetorium has extended an\ninvitation to the Aegis.
34	We would not wish to conceal this\ninformation from the other nations.
35	Oh yes, that's the Praetorium for you.\nImpartial to the last, eh?
36	Indeed.
37	That's not a problem for you, is it, Nia?
38	Sure, we're best friends now. I'll get\nover her throwing me in jail one day.
39	Now now, my lady, Mòrag and Brighid\nare on our side.
40	That's much safer than the\nalternative.
41	Yeah, yeah, I suppose.
42	Come on, Nia, lighten up!
43	It was all a big misunderstanding!\nThey helped us out and everything, remember?
44	You're such an idiot sometimes.
45	I'm an optimist-
46	Call it what you want. You're still an idiot.
47	Ugh. OK, fine. It's water under the bridge.
48	Go on! Friends, yeah?
49	Heh. Very well. Friends it is.
bf05100100_ms.json
1	I've never seen anything like this.\nA tunnel through the clouds...
2	It's because this archipelago is formed\nof many smaller Titans.
3	The forces between the Titans bend\nthe Cloud Sea into this shape.
4	There is a large Titan as well,\nat the center of the cloud mountains.
5	Though being within the Cloud Sea itself,\nyou won't find humans living on it.
6	The small Titans seem to like clustering around the\nlarger one, and that's what forms the archipelago.
7	Wow... So many amazing things to\nsee in world!
8	Masterpon should get out more often.
9	Working inside all day bad for mind and body, you know.
10	Tora on wonderful adventure with Rex-Rex right now though!
11	Days of staying inside all day are long gone!
12	Yeah. You're a Driver just like\nus now, Tora.
13	Mehmeh! Tora appreciate support from friend Rex-Rex!
bf05100150_ms.json
1	Hahah, that takes me back!
2	What the hell?\nYou wouldn't catch me dead doing that.
3	Don't knock it till you try it. It's how\nwe all learned to swim in the clouds!
4	You mean, you did that too?
5	Yeah, of course.
6	It came in really handy when I became\na salvager.
7	I can't stand it down there. It's not like water,\nfeels like the clouds are wrapping around you.
8	And you don't like heights, either.
9	You get used to it really quick. Hey,\nyou want to give it a go?
10	Wha- Hey, no! You get away from me!\nDon't touch me!
11	Stop that, Rex! Don't tease her.
12	All right, all right.
13	Honestly, when are you gonna grow up a little?
bf05110100_ms.json
1	Very impressive.
2	We've refitted the drivetrain to use\nArdainian technology.
3	All of the control mechanisms have been\nbeautifully preserved,
4	so we should be able to finish relatively soon.
5	Finally, we will be able to compensate for our forces'\ndepletion. The Gormott struggle takes its toll.
6	Sir.
7	And there are no safety concerns, I trust?
8	The explosion three months ago was most unfortunate.\nOr had you forgotten?
9	We've been running a sedative drip through the\nTitan's fluids since then. No further difficulties.
10	We've also encased the back end\nin composite steel.
11	That should withstand sustained\nenemy fire.
12	Even if it were to be blown up...\nWell, it'll be in enemy territory.
13	A pyrrhic victory, I'd say.
14	Well, the crew will have escape pods.
15	Escape pods? Are you sure you don't mean coffins?
16	I mean...
17	Hmph...
18	Judicium, the dead nation that\nrealized Flesh Eater technology...
19	I cannot say I find their\ncreations tasteful.
20	I'm aware you do not agree with the principle\nof fusing Blades with human cells.
21	Few people do.
22	Not what I mean.
23	I'm sorry, sir? Then what exactly do you...?
24	It's said that Flesh Eaters were created\nin the quest for ever stronger Blades.
25	But is that really true?
26	What I see in them is the shadow of a people\nscrabbling to prolong their existence.
27	I look at them and see ourselves.\nThat is what I despise.
28	I will leave for Indol shortly.\nMuch remains to be done.
bf05120100_ms.json
1	Rex!
2	Whoa, Kirk? Kazuna? You guys\nsure have grown!
3	And hey, is that really-
4	That's our Mark.
5	He'll be going away to school in Indol soon,\nthanks to the help you've been sending us.
6	Auntie Corinne, good to see you!
7	Wow, this is quite a welcome...
8	I didn't realize you were sending your\nmoney home.
9	That's very admirable for such a young\nman.
10	Home, huh...
11	Old lady have lots of littlepons!
12	Masterpon, these clearly not all\nlittlepons of same parent.
13	My word! Is that old Azurda there?
14	What have you gone and done\nto yourself?
15	That would take some explaining.
16	Incidentally...\nIs there some way you could put us up for the night?
17	Long day and all.
18	"Is there some way?" Don't give me\nthat!
19	Stay for as long as you like! What's mine is yours.
20	Thank you.
21	Auntie, thank you so much.\nI think I'll go for a bit of a walk first, though.
22	Ah, yes.\nLeave your friends with me.
23	Pyra, could you come along too?
24	Hm?\nO-of course.
25	Right then, come with me, all of you!
bf05130100_ms.json
1	Where are we?
2	These are my parents' graves.
3	What?!
4	Sorry. I guess I never properly\ntold you about myself. I...
5	No, it's fine.
6	I'm sorry I never thought to ask...
7	I wanted you to meet them, though.
8	To meet them? How do you mean?
9	Hey, Mum... Dad...\nIt's been a while.
10	A ton happened, you know - I became\na Driver!
11	And this girl...is Pyra.
12	My new partner.
13	I know you'd love her.
14	We- we're going to Elysium. Pyra and me.
15	I don't know what's coming next, but...
16	You'll be watching over us, right guys?
17	Rex...
18	Right. Let's head back.
19	OK.
bf05140100_ms.json
1	I'm so sorry, making you wash\nup like this.
2	No no, don't worry about it!
3	I don't have to be in a fight to be\nable to help people. I like it.
4	You're a dear. Rex is very lucky\nyou're around.
5	He's never brought a girl to meet\nme before!
6	Huh? No no no, it's not like that!\nI'm just Rex's Blade!
7	Is that so?
8	You do hear of Blades and Drivers getting\nmarried a lot in the old stories!
9	Err...
10	This is a lovely village.\nEveryone's so warm and carefree.
11	It's removed from everything, you see.
12	I think if everyone could live like this...\nThe world might be a happier place.
13	You know, between you and me...
14	I think, deep down,\nRex still misses his mother a little.
15	In a way, you remind me of her. Just a tad.
16	Of Rex's mother? Really?
17	Actually... He took me to say hello to his parents.
18	Ahh...
19	You know, Rex wasn't born here in Fonsett.
bf05140150_ms.json
1	He must have been two years old when he\ncame ashore here with his poor mother.
2	Maybe it was war, or a dying Titan...\nBut they'd lost their home, sure enough.
3	I gather it was a great struggle to\nget here. She was so weak...
4	She asked me to look after Rex, and...
5	That was the last thing she said.
6	She seemed so lovely, too...
7	And his father...
8	We found his body about three\ntitanpeds away from here.
9	He came so far...\nIf only he'd made it a little farther.
10	Such a sad business.
bf05140160_ms.json
1	How awful...
2	That boy has suffered enough loss for one life.
3	That's why he became a salvager, you know.\nTo find some way up to Elysium.
bf05140180_ms.json
1	In that case...
2	Maybe it's not good for me to\nbe by Rex's side after all...
3	Why, are you not fond of him?
4	Oh, I am!
5	But, with me here...he'll suffer even more, lose even more.
6	So maybe... Maybe Rex is better off without me.\nRex...and the whole world. They don't need me.
7	That's just how it feels.
8	Now, dear...
9	[ML:undisp ]...
bf05150100_ms.json
1	OK, time to move out!
2	See you soon, Rex!
3	You take care now.\nAnd keep yourself out of trouble, Azurda!
4	Ah, you know me. I prefer the quiet life.
5	Thank you for everything.
6	Pyra, dear - I don't know what you've\nbeen through before...
7	But you should know you're not alone anymore.
8	Rex is a strong boy.
9	You can depend on him, whenever and wherever you need him.
10	...I know. I'll try.
11	Huh? What was all that about?
12	Nothing at all. Right?
13	Nothing for your ears, Rex.
14	You just concentrate on what you're doing.\nWork hard, and do your best!
15	Sure, I will.
bf05160100_ms.json
1	Finally.\nYou took your sweet time.
2	...You're the...
3	Hey, Shellhead!
4	Hey.
5	You just don't give up, do you? C'mon,\nout of the way.
6	More like stubborn leech than turtle.
7	Hah. This time I'm here for something\na little bit different.
8	Ugh, what's that supposed to mean?
9	I want to see just how good you are, chum.
10	I've been waiting here for three whole days already!
11	Three days? Seriously?
12	You know what, no thanks, I don't pick on idiots.
13	Well then.
14	Fight me and we'll see who's the idiot!
15	How did you know that we'd be here...?
16	I'll tell you...if you can beat me!
17	You want to join the fun too?
18	No, you all go ahead.
19	Huh? Why?
20	What a shame! Looks like the illustrious\nFlamebringer won't be helping you this time.
21	Thanks for the concern and all, but maybe you\nshould be worrying about yourself.
22	Big tree to your right, big rock to your left,\nand a cliff right behind you.
23	Which one's gonna get you this time, eh?
24	Not today, furry ears.
25	Check this.
26	Whoa!
27	What the-
28	Well?\nFeel like taking me seriously yet, hmm?
29	S-so strong...
30	What the...\nHow'd he do that?
31	Thunderbolt Zeke.
32	Tantal's most powerful Driver...and its\nCrown Prince.
33	Crown Prince of...Tantal?!
34	This guy?!
35	It is quite the rare opportunity to\nsee his...swordsmanship first-hand.
36	Now this is more like it. Ooh, come on,\nyeah! Keep it coming!
37	[ML:undisp ]...
38	That's it? That's all I get?!
39	Ugh, fine.
40	...Anyway. Ready to concede\ndefeat to the Zekenator?
41	As if!\nWe're only just warming up, you pompous arse!
42	I'm right with you. Let's show him what we got!
43	Hahaha, yessss! Let's see if the Aegis is worth\nthe hype!
44	Hyaaah!
bf05170100_ms.json
1	Not bad, chum.
2	Right back at you. Impressive!
3	Didn't think I'd ever see another Driver and\nBlade on Mòrag and Brighid's level...
4	You're still holding back. Where's the\nAegis's true power?
5	Mythra's power is only for fighting bad guys.
6	Aw, that's so sweet.\nSo I'm a good guy now, is that it?!
7	Am I wrong?
8	I like your attitude there, chum!
9	Well, that's an Aegis's Driver for you.
10	How did we do, Your Highness?
11	Sure, you pass.
12	I think we can just about let you into\nthe Praetorium.
13	What the hell?!
14	I've been working for Indol for a while now.\nA kind of...special envoy.
15	They asked me to keep an eye out for\nthe Aegis.
16	Actually, I volunteered to. You know how it is.
17	I'm jolly sorry for testing you like that.
18	We were planning on getting this\nover with in ONE encounter.
19	But His Highness has the\nmost awful luck, so...
20	Yeah, I think I got that.
21	What are you talking about?\nEveryone has bad days, right?
22	Ah!
23	Whyyy meeeee?!
24	There he goes.
25	Hmmm...bad luck indeed.
26	Uhh... Should we go rescue him?
27	Naaah, he'll find his own way back up somehow.
28	Let's just board the ship!
bf05180100_ms.json
1	Aahh, so pretty...
2	Amazing!
3	Whoa...
4	It's so grand...
5	(Sure, because they're trying too hard.)
6	(You don't have to be like that...)
7	Hm? Did you say something?
8	Oh no, nothing.
9	Your audience with the Praetor\nis scheduled for tomorrow.
10	Before that, maybe you'd all like to have a look around?
11	See the sights of Indol? Sounds\nlike a pretty rare opportunity!
12	Yeah! Let's look around city!\nTora want to see everything!
13	What are we, tourists?
14	There's no harm in that, is there?
15	This would be a first for me, too.
16	Right, you were a bit big to go running around\nIndol before now.
17	Now that's a funny image.
bf05200100_ms.json
1	"No More Blades, No More War"...\nWhat does that mean?
2	That, my fuzzy-eared friend, is an anti-Blade protest.
3	The refugees have really been going at\nit since last year or so.
4	Whoa! Where'd you come from?
5	What'd you do, swim here?
6	Did Blades do something wrong?
7	The Praetorium is single-handedly responsible\nfor doling out Core Crystals to other countries.
8	Though sometimes the likes of Dughall\nand Bana grab a piece of the pie.
9	Therefore, Indol has the power to control war itself?
10	That's one way of looking at it, at least.
11	But war's about much more\nthan just Blades and Drivers!
12	I know that and you know that, but that\ndoesn't mean they're gonna accept it.
13	I guess so...
14	There's a lot of...Gormotti here...
15	They fled the Gormotti War ten years ago.\nBut here they are, refugees still.
16	Yes. They're a funny old lot, you know.
17	We feed them, we water them, and this\nis the thanks we get.
18	Don't these ruffians know that manners cost nothing?
19	I swear, you lend these people a hand and\nthey want the whole bloody arm.
20	It's easy to disregard things beyond your control,
21	and direct your anger at targets closer to hand.
22	...
23	Do you have something to say?
24	Not really.
25	Out with it, Rex.
26	Mor Ardain's Titan -\nit's dying, and everybody knows it.
27	That's why they - why you need Gormott.
28	Our population is large.\nLarger than Uraya's.
29	But you don't have the resources to\nsupport all those people...
30	You are astute for someone so young.
31	Us salvagers pick up more than just artifacts.
32	I'm not daft.\nI know fine words alone won't change reality.
33	So you seek Elysium.
34	Is that wrong?
35	No. I was just reminded how young you are.
36	Still, if it's Rex, or people who harp on\nabout justice with no solutions...
37	I'm bettin' on Rex.
38	I must admit, I do respect the boy's drive.
39	Ahh, I'm just stumbling my way forward.
bf05210100_ms.json
1	Mòrag, can I ask you something?
2	Go ahead.
3	Rex is the one who woke up Mythra.
4	And I think he appreciates what that means.
5	And?
6	It's just that, well...\nyou're not doing anything to stop us.
7	Why is that?
8	Because of Addam.
9	!
10	Five hundred years ago...
11	He became this great hero,\nwho we celebrate even today.
12	But I know him only through legends.
13	A chance to see what his Blade is capable of for myself?\nI confess I was intrigued.
14	So here I am.
15	You know I'm not Addam, right?
16	But you are the Aegis's Driver.
17	The second you're under imperial control,\nyou won't be that hero anymore.
18	Hmm... I'm not sure I follow.
19	People with great power should be their own masters.
20	Is that what you mean?
21	Close enough. You can interpret it that\nway if you like.
22	Heh, even the mighty Flamebringer\ncan be bloody hard work sometimes.
23	Can't you just admit the real reason?
24	I don't like what you're implying.
25	The Inner Praetorium is beyond this gate.\nHere you will find the main administrative facilities.
26	With your permission, I'll show you to your lodgings.
bf05240100_ms.json
1	Your audience with the Praetor is scheduled for\ntomorrow, in the Sanctum's Audience Chamber.
2	If there is nothing else, I shall take my leave.
3	OK. Thanks for all your help.
4	My pleasure. Good night.
5	Night!
bf05250100_ms.json
1	Hey, Pyra...
2	So, Addam... What kind of a person was he?
3	Should I ask Mythra?
4	No, no, it's fine. I was just wondering.
5	He was incredible...
6	Incredible?
7	In Mythra's memories, I mean. I knew him\nonly very briefly before I went to sleep...
8	But Mythra can't remember a more genuine,\ncourageous person.
9	She had never met a more wonderful man.
10	He sounds like a real hero...
11	Mhm.
12	...And you remind her of him a lot.
13	Oh I do, do I? ...Great...
14	Wait, what?!
15	*giggle* I suppose Mythra won't be\nvery pleased I told you that.
16	Pyra, c'mon...
17	I agree with her, you know.
18	[ML:undisp ]...
bf05260100_ms.json
1	Whew, it's cold this morning...
2	Miss Fan...?
3	Oho, has somebody got a little crush?
4	Nia!!! What are you doing here?!
5	Early riser. Always have been.
6	Ooh, I see how it is here. I wonder what\nPyra and Mythra would think...
7	Hey, no - you've got the wrong-\nJust-
8	Just what? Go on!
9	I dunno. I thought she looked...sad.
10	Oh, good morning, you two.\nThere's still some time before your audience.
11	Sorry, we just woke up really early.
12	Ah, I see.
13	That's a pretty nice mural. Very...grand.
14	It depicts the creation of Alrest.
15	They say this mural was painted long ago,\nwhen the nation of Indol was still new.
16	You've been looking at it for a while...
17	...They're missing.
18	What do you mean by "they"?
19	My memories.
20	I know that I must have been around since\nthis mural was first painted, or even earlier, but...
21	I don't remember that time at all.
22	...Well, you are a Blade.
23	I don't know who I was or what I did.
24	And I'd really like to.
25	Mythra's lived for an awful long time. Maybe\nshe'll know something about you.
26	Mythra called me Haze earlier.
27	Could it be possible that she met me somewhere before?\nSometime in the past?
28	Do you wanna ask her later?
29	Could I? Thank you very much.
30	N-no need to thank me.\nYou helped us too!
31	Look at you, going all red.\nI'll tell Pyra, I swear.
32	Wha-?! I told you, it's not like that!
33	We'll see...
bf05270100_ms.json
1	Hey, relax. You'll give yourself wrinkles.
2	A Driver and Blade are one in body and soul.
3	It was you who told me that.\nWell, the other you, I mean.
4	You mean Mythra?
5	Of course, it was five hundred years ago,\nso perhaps you have forgotten.
6	(Oh! I do remember saying that!)
7	(So it's true?\nBut how could she possibly remember...)
8	...You're wondering how I could remember\nwords from so long ago?
9	What's this?
10	You could call it a diary, I suppose.
11	It contains details about my past lives.\nIt's the only way I have to remember.
12	When we return to the Core Crystal, our minds are\nwiped clean of all memories.
13	Though a Blade's life is eternal...
14	Our effective lifespans as individuals\nare far shorter than a human's.
15	You know, it's not just me.\nA lot of Blades try to preserve their memories in journals like this one.
16	...Even though it's often futile.
17	After all, a Core Crystal cannot protect a diary.
18	Usually, the volume is lost to us,\nalong with our memories.
19	I'm fortunate amongst Blades. I'm passed down as an\nimperial treasure, and recorded in official chronicles.
20	Er, Brighid...?
21	I don't know where your true intentions lie.\nI can only make an educated guess.
22	But Rex... He is your Driver.
23	If you truly trust him, I would\nadvise you tell him everything.
24	If you can't do that even for him...
25	You shouldn't be his Blade at all.
26	I just...
27	If you care about him, it's even more important.
28	I know what it's like to be afraid of rejection.\nI really do.
29	But...if you don't tell him now...
30	...you're just storing up pain for later,\nnot making it easier.
31	The way you say that...\nYou really do see right through me.
32	Well. We go back a long way, as you recall.
33	And we're both Blades, after all.
bf05280100_ms.json

2	"Praetor? ... Praetor Amalthus?"
3	[System:Size size=120 ]"Father waits,\n above..."[/System:Size]
bf05290100_ms.json
1	The boy has arrived, Your Eminence.
2	Thank you.
bf05300100_ms.json
1	So you're Rex.\nI've heard much.
2	Hi, err...
3	Y-you're not the Praetor, are you?
4	Huh? No way.
5	Indeed, I am Amalthus.
6	I understand your surprise. I imagine you\nexpected somebody older.
7	We heard that you were Cole's Driver...
8	Y-Your Eminence!\nSorry, sorry!
9	No need for formalities. I am a mere\nrepresentative of the Praetorium.
10	The name "Praetor" is simply a...decoration,\nif you will.
11	In any case, we're the same, you and I.\nAegis Drivers.
12	I consider us...equals.
13	Ahaha, I feel a bit better now you've\nput it that way. Your Eminence.
14	You're different somehow.\nI seem to recall a more forceful personality.
15	...
16	Oh! I almost forgot, here-
17	I got this from Cole.
18	He said it belonged to you. Please!
19	Ah...Cole...\nThat brings back memories.
20	We're looking for a way to Elysium.\nCole told us...that you would know the way.
21	I have to get to Elysium!\nTo...to save Alrest any way I can!
22	I mean, we won't know for sure what we can do\nuntil we get there, I suppose.
23	But if the stories are true, it's somewhere we\ncan all live safely! It has to be real!
24	Long ago...
25	Too long ago, I used to think like you.
26	Indeed, it led me to climb the World Tree.
27	However... I did not find Elysium.
28	Or the Architect.
29	I believe...it was because I was unworthy.
30	Rex, I know your desire all too well.\nI shall help you on your quest.
31	Really?\nOh, thank you so much!
32	No need for thanks.\nThis may be my destiny.
33	The reason I've lived all these years.
34	And now...
35	Pyra. My name is Pyra.
36	I would be honored to have a moment alone with Pyra.
37	I'd like to...reminisce a little.
bf05310100_ms.json
1	So old man Cole really did know the Praetor.\nWho'd have thought?
2	World is small place.
3	Will Pyra be OK by herself?
4	He's the Praetor, dimwit.\nWhat's he gonna do, eat her?
5	...Back there, I felt something weird for a second.
6	What?
7	[ML:undisp ]...
8	Rex?
9	...It felt like we were talking to that Malos guy.
10	You're imagining things.
11	You know he's Malos's Driver,\nand it's messing with your head.
12	They not seem alike to me.
13	No, I know - it was just for an instant!
14	Just this one moment where I couldn't tell if\nwe were talking to the Praetor or Malos...
15	Sorry. I'm not explaining it well.
16	There are Blades who are influenced a lot\nby their Drivers during resonance.
17	Their appearance, their personality...\nThat's probably all it is.
18	Perhaps it was due to your bond with Pyra.\nThat could have heightened your perception of such things.
bf05320100_ms.json
1	It was painted fifteen hundred years ago.
2	Even through exposure to the elements, it has never needed\nrepair. Always as pristine as the day it was made.
3	The technique is long-forgotten.
4	I often wonder if we are growing as a people...\nor in fact, regressing.
5	What do you think?
6	I'm just amazed at how little you've changed.\nHas nobody ever wondered about that?
7	I am Indoline, and the Driver of an Aegis.\nIt keeps me young.
8	If you say so...
9	Why do this now, though?
10	You've never let anyone go there before, have you?
11	Times change, Mythra. So do people.
12	That's not an answer.
13	I would like to believe there is one who can\nreach the Architect and save this dying world.
14	Is that really so strange?
15	And Rex is the one?
16	Would you have resonated with him\nif he did not hold such potential?
bf05330100_ms.json
1	It's still intact after all these centuries. Amazing.
2	The pinnacle of Flesh Eater technology...
3	Tenacious creatures, humans.
4	I'm so sorry to do this to you...
bf05350100_ms.json
1	I see. Very well.
2	It appears Senator Roderich paid a visit\nto the Praetorium last night, off the record.
3	Did you know that?
4	No. I haven't heard anything from His Majesty.
5	Why now, I wonder? I can't imagine\nhe was just paying his respects.
6	Do you think it's something to do with\nthe excavation? Temperantia?
7	Hmm. The issue His Majesty mentioned?
8	If that is the case, he must be making covert\ndeals with the Praetorium...
9	Curse that man...
bf05370100_ms.json
1	Sincere apologies everyone, but\nI come with an urgent request.
2	Please go to the Audience Chamber at once!
bf05380100_ms.json
1	As you may know, there is a demilitarized\nzone between Mor Ardain and Uraya.
2	Temperantia. Think of it as a buffer between\nthe two nations.
3	We've received word of fighting in the area.
4	Mor Ardain are in possession of a Titan weapon.
5	They're advancing as we speak towards the\nUrayan garrison.
6	Impossible!
7	Well, the two countries' Titans are at their closest\nright now...
8	You're saying we were waiting for a chance to strike?
9	Unthinkable!
10	Our people would never go to war against His Majesty's will!
11	At any rate, we must investigate.
12	Yes... You're right.
13	Praetor, I beg your leave. We need to find out what's going on.\nYour Eminence.
14	Thank you.
15	Your Eminence, we...
16	Might I ask you to assist Special Inquisitor Mòrag\nin her investigation?
17	We have no reason to refuse.\nAnd you needn't worry about me.
18	I am quite grateful to hear that.
19	Let's go after them, hurry!
bf05390100_ms.json
1	Who?!\nWho's responsible for this?!
2	Preparations are still ongoing,\nif we attack now we could-
3	What have you done, Senator Roderich?
4	Special Inquisitor?! What are you doing here?
5	The Emperor ordered that the dig be halted.\nHe was very specific, Senator.
6	If you've restarted it, you have violated\nHis Majesty's will.
7	The Emperor doesn't understand Mor\nArdain's urgent lack of resources.
8	This is for the Empire.
9	Your patriotism is touching.
10	But that doesn't explain why you're\nwaging war with Uraya!
11	It wasn't me! I did not give that order!
12	Even I would never dream of declaring\nwar without His Majesty's express consent!
13	So who in the...
14	Mòrag!
15	Who...who are these people?!\nBursting in here?
16	This is the Driver of the Aegis.\nYou are to afford him the same respect as me.
17	This is him?! I'd heard the rumors, but this boy...
18	There are rumors now?\nWow, am I really that famous?
19	Do you have any idea how much it costs to repair a water tower?\nIt's a lot.
20	So, less famous, more infamous.
21	Mòrag, is Mor Ardain really attacking?
22	They are. As much as I hate to admit it.
23	Tell me - what's going on?!
24	Tricky indeed.\nIf this escalates into all-out war...
25	The timing is all wrong.\nWe can't win this fight, not now...
26	Sounds like you WERE planning to start\nthis sooner or later. Sly rat.
27	Maybe save the accusations for now.
28	But the Empire never really wanted a war, did it?
29	That Core Crystal! Don't tell me...you're the-
30	Answer me!
31	Y-you're right.
32	Mythra?
33	Who stands to gain from an Ardainian-Urayan war?
34	Who gains... You don't mean-
35	Jin and Torna!
36	It very possible.
37	But how?
38	Maybe just coincidence after all...?
39	Masterpon...
40	I wish I could believe that.
41	Inquisitor Mòrag, please. You are the\nonly one who can put a stop to this!
42	It's a bit late for that, don't you think?
43	But I'm not going to sit back and watch.\nBrighid!
44	Right!
45	Mòrag!
46	Rex, this is an imperial matter.\nWe can't ask for your aid in this affair.
47	Not if it's really a coincidence, like Tora said.
48	But if Torna are really involved, doesn't\nthat make this our problem, too?
49	But...
50	Think of it as compensation for the water tower!
51	How's that?
52	I knew you'd go there.
53	You're so noble it hurts.
54	Very well. Can I ask you to help me again?
55	Yep! We're on the case!
56	Yes, of course.
57	I'll accompany you.
58	Fan?
59	What's happening in Temperantia right now...
60	It's being led by a weaponized Titan, correct?
61	My power doesn't only affect Blades.\nIt also works against Titans.
62	I am certain I can be of assistance.
63	Besides...
64	Besides?
65	I have the strangest feeling that I'm somehow\nmeant to be there.
66	Fan la Norne, you...
bf05400100_ms.json
1	Hey, remind me again why we're bringing this spanner?
2	Because this sounds like fun.
3	We're not on holiday here.
4	I've heard a lot about these Torna people.
5	They're the ones collecting Core Crystals, yeah?
6	And besides...
7	I can't pretend this doesn't concern us, too.
8	Not when they're calling themselves Torna...
9	Shellhead?
bf05400150_ms.json
1	Lady Mòrag, greetings. I have news from the front.
2	Our Titan weapon has crossed the central border!
3	It's advancing at about forty titanpeds per hour!
4	Hmm.\nI want to get in front of it.
5	Is there a suitable place to dock?
6	There's a bay fairly close by.
7	If you dock there you should be able\nto get to the cliffs above it.
8	Understood. Go.
9	Yes ma'am.
bf05400170_ms.json
1	DUMMY\nIntroductory scene: Temperantia
bf05410100_ms.json
1	How awful...
2	Hmm... They didn't stand a chance.
3	Look! Over there!
4	Watch out, here it comes!
5	Aaargh!
6	Ungh! Everyone OK?
7	Just about, I think.
8	We have to stop it!
9	How do we do that?!
10	On its back, there's an Ardainian drive mechanism.
11	If we can somehow sever the cables connecting it to each leg,
12	its energy supply will be cut off. It'll stop.
13	Lady Mythra, I presume you'll be able to destroy them?
14	Good plan!
15	Sure. That sounds like a feasible measure...
16	That is, if we don't mind reducing the\nwhole area to ashes.
17	What do you mean?
18	I read instruction manuals.\nIt's my job to know these things.
19	The weapon is powered by vaporized Titan bodily fluids.
20	The gas it makes is completely unstable. The slightest\nshock and we have a giant explosion on our hands.
21	There was...an accident here just three months ago\nbecause we didn't see how unstable it was.
22	If we'd just attacked without realizing that...
23	Argh, dammit!
24	Why make a weapon that dangerous?
25	As long as we got the weapon inside enemy lines,\ndestroying the weapon would destroy them too.
26	That was the justification given.
27	That's so cold it's almost impressive.
28	That's exactly why the Emperor called a halt\nto the excavation.
29	Can't we get at the people on board?
30	The control center is protected by ten layers of armor.
31	The chances of it being breached or destroyed are low.
32	But...that armor is limited.\nIt doesn't entirely cover the energy cables.
33	So...it's them or nothing.
34	How we get up on Titan's back?
35	Up ahead - there's a spot where the cliff juts out.
36	If we can get up there, we'll be able to jump onto its back.
37	But if our timing's off, we go headfirst down\nto the bottom of the cliff?
38	And we'd have to make it across\navoiding its attacks all the while.
39	I'll take care of it.
40	Fan?
41	I mean, I'll stop the Titan moving. While it's stopped,\nyou all jump onto its back.
42	Fan, you...
43	All right, then! But you'd better be careful!
44	Don't worry, I will.
45	Then let's go!
bf05410150_ms.json
1	Almost there!
2	Ugh... We can't get closer!
3	Allow me!
4	Fan...!
5	Leave her. She'll be fine, trust me.
6	Now! Let's move!
7	Yeah!
8	We just need to cut that...
9	[ML:undisp ]Wha-?!
10	An independent defense mechanism...
11	Ardainian technology. My apologies.
12	Why would you even bloody make something like that?
13	Bitch later - fight now!
bf05420100_ms.json
1	Hyaaah!
2	It's stopped...?
3	Yes. Seems like it.
4	It's you. I thought it might be.
5	Jin!!!
6	I knew it.
7	So this is Jin, leader of Torna.
8	I am Fan la Norne.
9	As envoy of Praetor Amalthus, I am bringing\nyou into custody.
10	How ironic. That you should speak his name with\nthat face... Oblivious to everything, even your own identity!
11	Wha...?!\nDo you know something about-?!
12	And you, Aegis! Don't you dare stand there,\nacting like you're not involved in all this!
13	All right. Then tell me this...
14	Why are you, who fought alongside us to\ndefeat Malos, now standing by his side?
15	Jin...fought against him...?!
16	It's very simple.
17	I realized he had the right of it.\nThat's all.
bf05440100_ms.json
1	I don't think it's as simple as that at all.
2	So clever.\nYou always were too clever for your own good.
3	Sorry, that's just the way I am.
4	Mythra, don't tell me-
5	Yes. He's a Blade too.
6	He was the strongest Blade in Torna...\nuntil it fell in the war.
7	"It fell," says the girl who sank it!
8	A Blade?
9	There were none stronger...yet none kinder, either.
10	And...no one who hated to fight more than him.
11	Why, Jin? What changed?!
12	What if I told you it was your fault?
13	Mine?
14	If you hadn't sealed yourself away...
15	Then she'd still...
16	So that's it...

18	[ML:undisp ]NOTICES SOMETHING
19	[ML:undisp ]NOTICES SOMETHING
20	[ML:undisp ]SURPRISE

22	That Core Crystal!
23	That color... It's like...blood.
24	Careful! That Crystal isn't normal.
25	Put away your sword.
26	My ability is to restrict a Blade's every action.
27	As long as you are a Blade, there is\nnothing you can do to escape its clutch.
28	Wait, restricting Blades' powers?!
29	Then before - was that...?!
30	Go ahead and try.
bf05450100_ms.json
1	How... How is he still moving?!
2	Even that Patroka girl couldn't withstand it...
3	No, it's working. His powers are certainly limited now.
4	But Jin...he's one of the most powerful Blades in history.
5	Even so, we can beat him!
6	We just have to work together!
7	I don't think so!
8	[ML:undisp ]!!!
9	What?!
10	Fan!
11	You are no slave. Be free now.
12	[ML:undisp ]...
13	Fan-
14	No - no, why?!
15	Jin!
16	Why the hell would you do this?!\nWhat good does it do you?!
17	Why, you ask...?
18	Then let me ask you this.
19	Blades are granted phenomenal\npower from our creator on high...
20	...yet we are doomed to never remember.
21	Why?!
22	What...
23	The accumulation of memories is what\nallows mankind, no, all life to grow.
24	Change, evolve.
25	But...Blades are fleeting.
26	When we return to our cores, our memories\nare lost. Our growth snatched away forever.
27	People aren't so different.
28	Man's life too has an end, yes.
29	However, though each individual life is fleeting...
30	You pass on your memories, allowing you\nto grow. As a species, as a culture.
31	Why does Indol control all the Core Crystals?
32	By controlling the moment of every Blade's birth,\nthey enslave our entire kind. How is that fair?
33	We have no culture because Indol decrees it.
34	Because that's what your kind do!
35	Jin...
36	Why are you the masters, and we the slaves?
37	It is we...
38	who embody the very nature of this world!
39	Blades...embody the world?
40	I don't...get what you're...
41	If you saw the last state of humanity,\nyou'd understand!
42	Now that you have come this far,\nthere can be no turning back.
43	But...
44	I'm afraid your journey ends here.
45	Gaahh!
46	[ML:undisp ]Wha-
47	Nghh... Why now...
48	Hey - now's our chance!
49	[ML:undisp ]Huh?
50	What are you standing around for?!\nShow that scumbag what's what!
51	What?!
52	It's Akhos!
53	Malos sent me.
54	Time to make an exit. Ready?
55	Ugh-
56	Who says we're going to let you go?
57	Hah...\nYou really don't understand, do you?
58	You really think this is over?
59	What the-
60	How?
61	We cut the bloody cable!
62	Certainly.
63	But some energy still remains,\ndeep in its core.
64	Don't you see?
65	It's like a Blade weapon!
66	Well, you seem busy.
67	I'll leave you to it. Bye!
68	Wait!
69	Ugh!

4	What?!
5	No!

7	At this rate, I don't think there's any stopping them.
8	How so?
9	They think Mor Ardain attacked them illegally.
10	With no declaration of war.
11	This is bad. If someone doesn't\nexplain what's really going on...
12	But there's no time for that!
13	So what? We just give up?!
14	Heavy cannons!\nThat's Uraya's main weapon.
15	Here, too!\nMor Ardain also readying artillery!
16	I don't care if we're not going to make it in time!
17	We need to get to Uraya!
18	Right!
19	Wait!

12	Are you really "here"?
13	I don't know...\nwhere I really am.
14	You're starting to sound like a human.
15	Oh yeah?
16	Perhaps we're not so different after all...
17	Humans and Blades...
bf06040100_ms.json
1	What's the deal with this ceasefire?
2	A tribunal, it looks like.\nPraetor Amalthus is here in person.
3	And who's gonna argue with the Praetor?
4	Does he have any clue how many men we lost...?!
5	If those Ardainians get away with this...\nArchitect damn it!
6	Quit yer grumblin', mate. All this is way\nbeyond our pay grade.
7	You got that right. We're all just faceless cannon fodder to the\nbigwigs. CO says jump, we jump.
bf06050100_ms.json
1	My deepest thanks to you for agreeing to this\nceasefire, Queen Raqura, Emperor Niall.
2	As I recall from the\nOsirian Treaty of 350 years ago...
3	the Praetorium was to refrain from\nintervention in times of war.
4	And yet here you are, intervening.
5	But I trust you have a suitable justification, Your Eminence?
6	Naturally.
7	But first, to ensure impartiality in\nthese negotiations,
8	may I present Niranira, Acting Chairman of the\nArgentum Trade Guild.
9	Furthermore, representing the Tantalese...
10	His Highness the Crown Prince Ozychlyrus\nBrounev Tantal will also be attending.
11	The Crown Prince?!\nThe prodigal prince of Tantal...
12	[ML:undisp ](a 'hmph'-like derisive snort)
bf06060100_ms.json
1	What a spectacle... Seems the Praetor\nhas as much clout around here as ever.
2	Could we not just take them out here and now?
3	Good point. All the principal\nnations' heads gathered here...
4	It'd make things easy later.
5	The way to the World Tree must first\nbe opened.
6	Wiping out mankind is the easy part.\nWe could manage that ourselves.
7	Even so...
8	That isn't our only goal, remember?\nWe must wait for the stage to be set.
9	Is Jin serious about this?
10	Yeah, I've been wondering that myself...
11	Heh. Oh, he's serious. He always is.
12	He will annihilate mankind.\nAnd then...
13	he will kill the Architect.
bf06070100_ms.json
1	Now, it seems Mor Ardain has been accused\nof a unilateral breach of treaty in this matter.
2	Emperor Niall, I open the floor to you.\nIs there anything you wish to say?
3	While we are still conducting investigations\ninto the cause, it cannot be denied...
4	that weaponry belonging to our forces\nwas discharged against Uraya.
5	Regardless of any possible reason and circumstance...
6	we are prepared to offer recompense\nfor this grave offence.
7	So you want to settle this with money...?
8	We will provide any compensation deemed necessary.
9	Perhaps I am misunderstanding.
10	To my ears, it sounds almost as if you mean\nto imply that the blame for these offences...
11	does not lie with Your Majesty at all!
12	We are investigating.\nI ask that we not draw any hasty conclusions.
13	What need is there for investigation?
14	I believe a cause has already been\nestablished. There are witnesses.
15	And that would be?
16	What a preposterous notion!\nThe people you speak of are merely a terrorist group!
17	How could they possibly command that measure of-?
18	It's the truth.
19	I, Ozychlyrus, swear this in the\nname of King Eulogimenos Tantal.
20	Can confirm Ex-Chairman Bana give\nthese people some kind of supplies.
21	Military supplies, me thinks.\nAnd in great number, yes.
22	But why would...?
23	What if I were to tell you that the Aegis Malos,
24	who razed the world five centuries ago, was involved?
25	Ridiculous. Everyone knows he\ndisappeared in a blaze of flame!
26	He's very much alive, believe me.
27	That arsehole - I mean, the Aegis -\nhas confronted us in person.
28	And if my word is not enough for you...
29	A Blade?! But-but that Core Crystal...!
30	This is another Aegis, named Mythra.\nYour Highness has heard of her, surely?
31	So the rumors that reached us were true...\nWho is its Driver?
32	If you knew that, I daresay your\nsurprise would be even greater.
33	But that is not the matter we are here to discuss,\nYour Highness. This is a dire situation...
bf06080100_ms.json
1	Six o'clock already...\nMythra's been in there for a long time now...
2	We've just gotta trust 'em. They're dealing\nwith the leaders of whole nations.
3	It's not like there's anything you\nor me can do to help...
4	*Sigh*
bf06090100_ms.json
1	I've noticed something about Malos.
2	He's an Aegis... But you wouldn't know it from how he's fighting.
3	I think...I'm pretty sure he's damaged in some way.
4	You mean he can't use the full extent\nof his powers?
5	The wounds I dealt in our battle long ago\nmay not be completely healed.
6	His end-goal is Elysium.
7	He wants to go back to the place he was born.\nThere he can heal until his powers have recovered.
8	If Malos is allowed to restore himself...
9	The horrors of five centuries past will return...
10	Or worse still. Malos's goal is simple.
11	He means to destroy humanity in its entirety.
12	Why would anyone desire that?
13	Perhaps he does not even need a reason.
14	It seems to be a deep-seated drive.\nAn instinct. As natural as breathing.
15	All of this is my responsibility.
16	Praetor Amalthus?\nWhatever do you mean?
17	It was none other than I who awakened Malos\nand unleashed him upon the world.
18	So, Your Eminence...\nthe rumor that you were once Malos's Driver is...
19	I never intended to obscure the truth.\nIt is writ plain for all to see in history books.
20	I was a fool...
21	It was to prevent such foolishness...
22	that all passage to the World Tree\nwas forbidden after the Aegis War.
23	However, it has become apparent that the\nlaws of men do not apply to Malos...
24	[ML:undisp ]*gasp*
25	The time may have come...\nto lift that restriction...
bf06100100_ms.json
1	I appreciate this.
2	Don't think you've earned my trust.
3	But since Rex is going to Elysium,\ntheir paths are bound to cross...
4	That's all.
5	I'm surprised you seem so devoted to the boy.
6	It's for both our sakes.
7	But you, Amalthus...\nWho is it that you're living for?
8	[ML:undisp ]...
bf06110100_ms.json
1	...
2	I guess they did call her a Goddess...\nThe state funeral makes sense.
3	Shouldn't you be with him?
4	He's a boy.\nBest not to bother them at times like this.
5	Heh. I expected you'd be more clingy.\nYou really are different from her.
6	Actually, letting him be was\nmore her idea than mine.
7	Really? Pyra's? Get out!
8	So wait, you're saying you WANT to\ngo be clingy, or what?
9	I'll burn you.
10	I kid, I kid! Sheesh.
11	It's weird though...
12	What is?
13	I mean, don't you think it's odd?
14	Normally, if a Blade or its Driver dies,\nit'll just go back to being a Core Crystal.
15	So why is Fan just dead?
16	I did wonder the same thing.
17	There's only one way I know for a dead\nBlade to keep its physical form.
18	Remember Minoth?\nI mean Cole. He was a Flesh Eater.
19	Yeah.
20	But Fan wasn't a Flesh Eater.\nI can say that for sure.
21	What's that?
22	That's the shape of Fan's Core Crystal.\nWell, how it used to be.
23	But...now it's a triangle!
24	Rex and I are quite a unique case,\nbut this is different still.
25	How's it different?
26	If a Blade shares its core with another,\nits shape changes in a uniform fashion.
27	In our case, the center part went to\nRex, and the outer part to us.
28	I don't know why that is,\nbut it seems to be a rule.
29	...But Fan's isn't like that...
30	Exactly.
31	It looks more like someone\nstole her core, doesn't it?
bf06120100_ms.json
1	My apologies.\nDid I keep you waiting?
2	No, not really.
3	What...were you doing?
4	I was cleansing the Core Crystals.
5	It markedly increases their resonance success rate.
6	Bonding with a Crystal carries\ncertain risks, you understand...
7	I know.
8	When I became the Driver of an Aegis,\nthis power was awakened in me.
9	...So I might be able to do it too?
10	Who knows. Different people are\ncut out for different things...
11	Right, yeah.
12	Now then. My work is done for the day.
13	Come with me.
14	A special envoy...to Tantal? Me?
15	Correct. Behold.
16	As a salvager, I imagine you are already aware,
17	But this is Alrest, the world we currently inhabit.
18	We make our home on Titans,\nmoving in circles around the World Tree.
19	And here lies the Great Void.
20	This Void came into being 500 years ago.\nIt did not exist prior to that.
21	So I've heard. It's in our way, anyway.\nIt stopped us reaching the World Tree.
22	The Great Void is carved from the Cloud Sea\nby a monstrous beast known as Ophion.
23	Wait, you mean...that thing...?
bf06120140_ms.json
1	To be precise, it is an Artifice,\na servant of the Aegis.
2	Of Mythra?!
3	So if that thingy is Mythra's,\nthen what did it attack us for?!
4	Doesn't make sense!
5	Ophion was felled in the ancient battle\nwith Malos, sinking below the clouds...
bf06120170_ms.json
1	This means...someone must have revived it.
2	Correct.
3	And you're saying that someone\nwas Zeke's home country, Tantal?
4	Yes. They gave Ophion one directive.
5	To ensure that none approach the World Tree.
6	They sought to prevent a repeat of the horrors of the Aegis War.\nSo an obstacle was created - the Great Void.
7	How did they manage a feat like that?
8	As I've said, mankind is regressing.
9	Only one artifact remains that can rescind\nOphion's orders, and it lies in Tantal.
10	It's called the Omega Fetter, and\nit's guarded by the royal family.
11	I'll take you to it.
12	I've prepared your envoy documents already.\nYour quest is to set foot in Elysium, correct?
13	Malos and his ilk will surely seek\nthe Omega Fetter for themselves.
14	I would ask you to reach Elysium before they do,\nand inform me of what you find there.
15	Do it as a favor for a once-foolish old man.
16	And so that people may have a future\nin this dying world...
bf06130100_ms.json
1	We can reach Tantal by ship, but once\nthere we'll need to do a spot of walking.
2	So we're traveling with Shellhead here?\nNever thought I'd see the day...
3	I think you'll find I make a fantastic ally.
4	Luck of Zeke not so great.\nBet we shipwrecked by tomorrow.
5	Hahaha!\nCheeky furball!
6	We're all gonna die.
7	Hey, Zeke...
8	You said before that Torna concerned\nyou too... What did you mean by that?
9	Whuh? Oh yeah, that.
10	I don't know about those clowns, but Torna\nthe country that fell 500 years ago...
11	They were the ancestors of us Tantalese.
12	The people of Tantal are descended from Addam,\nthe hero of Torna who escaped its destruction.
13	So... After Pyra fell asleep,\nAddam escaped to Tantal?
14	That's right!
15	That is the first I've heard of it.
16	I have studied much history, but this story never featured.\nMost peculiar.
17	We're humble. Don't really like to brag about it.
18	The only real trace left is in this\nhere sigil of the royal family...
bf06140100_ms.json
1	So why did you awaken Haze?
2	Because her power was of great use to me.
3	Indol has found itself under attack\nfrom Torna a number of times.
4	She was necessary in driving them back.
5	Really?
6	Then why don't you seem to have any others?\nBlades, that is.
7	Heh. Driver though I may be, I am no fighter.
8	Besides, I find the warrior monks here\nso reliable. They get the job done.
9	Hmm... If you say so.
10	I wonder, do you know why Torna are\nusing the name of a dead country?
11	Jin was a Blade of Torna, once.
12	Loyalty or nostalgia?\nWho can say. Perhaps both.
13	Is that really all there is to it?
14	You don't think so?
15	I don't know much about what\nhappened while I slept.
16	There are no written records either.\nAll we have is stories passed down.
17	And you think that is insufficient?
18	History is a murky thing. Only those present\ncan truly know what took place.
19	But weren't you one of those present?
20	And that is why I offer you my cooperation.
bf06140105_ms.json
1	I guess we'll find out if we go to Tantal...
bf06140110_ms.json
1	Hmm... Tensions seem high.
2	From what I gather,
3	it seems an official summit is to be\nheld between Mor Ardain and Uraya.
4	A summit? You mean, about the\nrecent punch-up? But I thought...
5	Didn't Praetor Amalthus get them\nto stop and sort it all out?
6	Perhaps there are some discussions they\nwould prefer Indol not to be privy to.
7	Besides, Uraya doesn't like to associate\ntoo closely with Indol.
8	They'd hate to be seen as\nacquiescing to the Praetor's will.
9	Gotta keep up appearances, you know?
10	Ac...quiescing? You what?
11	Like, letting him tell 'em what's what.
12	Hah, for such a spanner you sure use\nsome big words. How come?
13	Stop calling me that! Buzz off, kitty-no-mates!
14	Anyway, this summit would explain\nwhy Mòrag isn't around...
15	Indeed.\nShe has much to attend to.
bf06140120_ms.json
1	Shared sovereignty over Gormott?
2	Yes. I don't think anything less will\nbe sufficient to placate them.
3	The Senate would never approve it...
4	I can overrule them by decree.
5	Of course, I would need to secure\nSenator Roderich's cooperation.
6	Imperial decree?
7	If it's come to that... Well then I cannot dissent.
8	I cannot help but admire your courage, Your Majesty.
9	That means a lot, coming from you.
10	Acting Chairman Niranira.
11	Sorry for intrude.
12	Is emergency, so Niranira take\nliberty of drop by unannounced...
13	You certainly look troubled, Chairman.
14	So... What is this emergency you speak of?
15	Well...
bf06140130_ms.json
1	So, we can make our way to Tantal from here.
2	I assume the Praetor has a ship waiting for us.
3	Hey, Shellhead.
4	What?
5	Are we really gonna just leave Mòrag behind?
6	Who's leavin' anyone? She's got her own priorities, y'know.
7	Yeah, but still...
8	Anyway, her schedule is filled with\nofficial duties right now.
9	For sure.\nIt's just a bit of a shame, is all.
10	You know, since we came all\nthis way together.
11	I guess I know how you feel, chum.
12	Uh?\nSpeak of the devil...
13	Bana's going for the summit?
14	On top of everything, an assassination attempt?
15	If blood gets spilled at the summit, it'll mean war.
16	War's good for business, after all.
17	I guess he wants to use that to\nget himself back in with the Guild...
18	Why, that little... I was wondering where\nhe'd slunk off to! What a sneaky git...
19	It seems Acting Chairman Niranira...
20	wishes to take care of this incident covertly,\nto avoid it reflecting badly upon the Guild.
21	So you came to us?
22	If we mobilize the army, the whole\nthing will become public.
23	Oh, I get it.\nSo we're a more convenient solution.
24	I'm not forcing you.
25	If you refuse, Brighid and I will\ndo what we can alone.
26	Ah, come off it, lady.
27	You wouldn't even think of dragging us into this\nif you thought you could handle it on your own.
28	I suppose not.
29	You know Bana as well as I.\nThere's no telling what he might be plotting.
30	According to Acting Chairman Niranira...
31	several giant weapons were being built\nat the factory where we last saw him.
32	And one of them is currently unaccounted for.
33	Giant...weapons...
34	Got it.
35	Besides, you know. We've got our own score to settle with him.
36	Thank you.
37	It will be easier to focus on my duties\nknowing you are on the case. Good luck.
38	Leave it to us!

1	Stop everything! Hold it!
2	Craa! Wh-wh-what? Who's you?
3	Don't play dumb!
4	Poison! That food is poisoned!
5	P-p-p-poison?\nYou kids krazy in brains!
6	We're past talking!\nQuick, grab 'em!
7	Yahh!

1	Please wait!
2	Pupunin?!\nWhat are you doing here?
3	What silly question!
4	It Pupunin who hire world-famous band\nof gourmet chefs, Fire Dragons!
5	World-famous...
6	...gourmet chefs?!
7	Mor Ardain very insistent, want only\nvery best food for important summit!
8	Pupunin work wings to bone finding\nchefs and now what this?!
9	Uh? So you mean...
10	...these guys are...
11	...just a bunch of cooks?!
12	I did think they were not putting up much of a fight.
13	Then this food is actually...
14	D-d-d-deeeeelicious!\nI could eat this stuff forever!
15	What friend doing?!\nVery expensive food now go to waste!
16	S-sorry! We really did think they\nwere here to murder someone...
17	Murder?!\nWhat this nonsense friends talk?!
18	I demand compensation!
19	Friends have no idea how much time and money\nPupunin spent on this-
20	An explosion?!
21	From where?!
22	Hey! What's going on?
23	Explosion in the hangar!
24	It's really bad!
25	Right when everyone was busy with\nQueen Raqura's arrival!
26	The Queen is here? This is it!
27	Rex, we need to hurry!
28	Yeah!
29	Hey! Heyheyhey, wait!
30	Hey! No running away!\nCompensatioooon!
bf06140170_ms.json
1	Who are you, villain?!\nIs this some underhanded Ardainian trick?!
2	Wrong! But also right!\nTruth is complicated!
3	Anyhow, here is where Queen die.
4	If it look like Queen killed by Mor Ardain,\nme in the money again!
5	That voice...
6	Bana, from the Argentum Guild.
7	Correct!\nTop marks for the Queen!
8	But you were unseated as Chairman.
9	Is not so easy to get rid of Bana!
10	Trade Guild of Argentum belong to Bana!\nDown to last screw, last drop of oil!
11	Grr...
12	Hold it, Bana!
13	You...Rex!
14	Meeeeh!\nBana not let Rex interfere with plans!
15	Again and again...\nBana not stand for this!
16	Masterpon! That Artificial Blade!
17	It Rosa?! Meh-meh-meh... Tora feel\nmuch greater power than before...
18	Especially from mark on forehead!
19	What's going on?!
20	Wh-what's that?!
21	Oho-ho-ho...
22	Even Emperor come straight to Bana!\nConvenient little moth to flame!
23	Come on, Bana.\nCut the bad-guy talk and accept you've lost.
24	You know you won't get away with it,\nwhat with all these witnesses here!
25	If Bana simply kill everyone then nobody blab!
26	Victory of Bana is assured...
27	You know we can't let you do that!

30	Things go very different this time!
bf06140180_ms.json
1	How...
2	Even Giga Rosa defeated by\nthese nasty meddling kids...
3	This ends here, Bana.\nYou are under arrest.
4	The Praetorium will handle the judgment.\nAssassination is a serious matter.
5	Your sentence will be harsh.
6	So the mercantile genius Bana...
7	meets an inglorious end before my\nvery eyes. Pitiful.
8	Grrr...\nBana is...
9	[ML:undisp ]Mm?
10	Bana is not kind of man to go down like this!
11	Ah!
12	If I go down, I take you with me!

15	As you wish!

28	Mòrag...
29	Dromarch.
30	Yes?
31	Distract the others...
32	Distract...?\nI'm not sure I...
33	N-no! My Lady, you cannot-!
34	There's still time...
35	Hurry!
36	Yes...my lady.
37	There are more of them!
38	Where?!
39	What'd you say?!
40	This way.
41	The rest of you should get to safety!
42	Chum!
43	I'm on it!
44	You are...
45	Shh. You're gonna be fine...
46	What d'you mean, imagined it?!
47	You got us all in a proper tizzy!
48	My apologies...\nI thought I spied silhouettes...
49	I did not mean to cause trouble.
50	Heeey!
51	[ML:undisp ]Uh?
52	Hey! You guys!
53	His Majesty the Emperor is awake!
54	What?!
55	Can it be?!
56	Majesty!
57	I apologize...for making you worry...
58	Majesty...
59	It's... It's a miracle...
60	When Aegaeon returned to his core,\nI was certain we had lost you...
61	Honestly...you call yourselves soldiers?
62	First aid? Anyone heard of it?
63	But...his wounds...
64	Just scratches.
65	Pfft. Nothing me and Dromarch can't handle.
66	You saved-?!
67	Heheh...
68	Thank you, Nia.\nI truly don't know how to...
69	I will never be able to repay you\nfor what you-
70	Oh, don't sweat it.
71	Let's just say you owe me one.\nThat'll do fine, right?
72	Nia...
bf06140190_ms.json
1	You shouldn't be up.
2	It's only been one day...\nPlease don't strain yourself.
3	Half a day off and look at all this paperwork!
4	I swear, it's like they don't want me to sleep at all!
5	Majesty...
6	Special Inquisitor.\nI hereby issue you new orders.
7	It is my wish that you travel with the Aegis\nas an emissary of the Empire.
8	Guard her and defend her against her enemies\nuntil she reaches Tantal.
9	Guard...the Aegis?
10	I've already discussed it with His Eminence.
11	Forgive me.\nYour Majesty, I cannot accept.
12	Just think about what happened yesterday!
13	It would be sheer foolishness\nfor me to leave your side!
14	Is that so?
15	[ML:undisp ]Huh?
16	I can see it in your eyes.\nIt's clear that the Aegis...
17	...or rather, that boy, has made a great impression on you.
18	That's not-!
19	I am your...Special Inquisitor. Ensuring Your\nMajesty's safety is my only concern.
20	To abandon that duty and go traveling...
21	Is this...Aegaeon's...?
22	A Driver who cannot even protect\nhimself is no Driver at all.
23	Yesterday's events have made me keenly\naware that I have no aptitude for it.
24	It will be of more use in your hands.
25	Majesty...
26	The world is changing, Mòrag.
27	I trust you more than anyone to lend that boy\nthe wisdom and strength he will need.
28	[ML:undisp ]...
29	I miss it, you know.\nLake Yewtle, in Gormott.
30	...What?
31	Remember when the two of us would shake off\nthe servants and go swimming there?
32	Ah... Yes.\nOf course.
33	Kids from the nearby village would come too.\nGood times.
34	Majesty...
35	If Mor Ardain...
36	No, the whole of Alrest could be like\nthat again... Wouldn't it be beautiful...?
37	Is that my new duty, then?
38	In truth, it should have been you\nsitting in this chair right now...
39	The imperial line has always passed from father to son.
40	On the day Your Majesty was born, that's exactly what happened.
41	I knew that day would come. It came as no surprise.
42	You were raised by my father to take\nthe throne of the Empire.
43	As befits the daughter of my Lord Uncle Eandraig.
44	And I am grateful for it.
45	If not for him, I would never have met Brighid.\nNever have met...them.
46	I'd have missed out on so much.
47	There. Those are your true feelings.
48	[ML:undisp ]-!
49	A magnificent power resides in you.
50	Mòrag, power like yours exists to be used.
51	Niall...
52	You've been tied down long enough.
53	Follow your heart,\nMòrag Ladair.
54	I have no words.\nThank you, Your Majesty.
55	Very well, then.
56	I hereby accept the task you have assigned to me.
57	That's the Mòrag I know and love.\nMake me proud.
bf06140195_ms.json
1	...So that's how it is.\nIt seems our paths continue to entwine.
2	That's awesome news!
3	To be honest, I was really hoping there\nwas some way you could stick around.
4	I was just thinking of asking you myself.
5	Saved you the trouble, did I?
6	That you did!\nThanks a bunch, Mòrag!
bf06180100_ms.json
1	I can't help but feel that in all the\nconfusion surrounding Bana, our concerns...
2	have been neatly swept aside.
3	The Praetorium maintains absolute control over\nBlade distribution. It is quite vexing...
4	Awakening rates from natural\ncores are very low,
5	which limits the pool\nof compatible Drivers.
6	So to create large numbers of Drivers,\nthe cleansing Indol provides is a necessity.
7	That much I am willing to accept.
8	The real problem is the fact that the Aegis has awakened.
9	This is no time to be squabbling over territory.
10	If we misread the situation even a little,\nUraya itself could be sunk to the Cloud Sea's bed.
11	Emperor Niall must surely be thinking the same thing...
12	That's why he sent his precious Mòrag to shepherd them along.
13	And now we find ourselves in their debt...
14	Who could have predicted such\nan act of selflessness?
15	Was it just the passion of youth, or was it...?
16	My liege...
17	In any case, for now we should keep our troops\nmobilized while we monitor the situation.
18	I hardly expect Tantal will comply with\nthe Praetor's plans so easily, either...
bf06190100_ms.json
1	Say, chum. Which one d'you fancy,\nPyra or Mythra?
2	Uh, Zeke...\nYou can't just ask someone...
3	Anyway, they're the same person! I've never\nreally thought of them separately...
4	Are you serious?\nBut they're like, totally different characters.
5	Like, Mythra is jolly intense.
6	And Pyra is just totally mellow, or, I dunno...\nWhat's the opposite of "pushy"?
7	On the outside, maybe.
8	But Pyra's got a lot of backbone too.\nShe can be pretty stubborn!
9	You seem to understand them pretty deeply.
10	Well, I suppose you ARE their Driver.
11	Hey...
12	Yeah?
13	You're a prince from Tantal,\naren't you, Zeke?
14	Why were you in the Praetorium?
15	I mean, you can't just ask someone...
16	Oh, his old man kicked him out!
17	Oi, no! Bad Blade, bad!
18	...How long have you been standing there?
19	From about..."which one d'you fancy".
20	"Which one d'you fa..."\nThat's the whole conversation!
21	As I was saying, my Prince got\ndisowned by his father.
22	He spent all his time traveling the world\nfor fun, instead of attending to his studies.
23	Then byeee!
24	It wasn't for fun! I was learning all about,\nuh, society and international relations!
25	"International relations," that whatcha call it?
26	Oi, can it, you! What are you doing\nanyway, dissing your own Driver?!
27	Hahahah, you guys crack me up.
28	I love him really.
29	Aww!\nAnyway, he sounds tough. Zeke's dad, I mean.
30	Tantal is an isolationist society...
31	Crossing its borders without leave\nis strictly forbidden.
32	It's been that way for ages now.
33	Oh, hmm...
34	But you've seen how my Prince here is.
35	Couldn't stop himself leaving a few times,\nso he got chewed out and disowned.
36	Back when he was, fifteen or something?
37	Yeah, something like that.
38	Then the Praetor himself found him half-dead\non the ground one day, and took him in.
39	He made up that "special envoy" stuff.
40	And that's how you ended up in Indol...
41	It all makes sense now.
42	Oh, but wait...\nIs it safe for you to go back to Tantal, then?
43	This time we've got official business from\nthe Praetorium! It'll be fine. Probably.
44	Besides...
45	Yeah?
46	Tantal is too ignorant of the outside world.\nIt needs a wake-up call.
47	Sire! We have reached the designated coordinates.\nPlease.
48	Right! Ready?
49	You betcha!
50	Huh?
51	Shut up and sit down, chum.\nThis'll be great!
bf06210100_ms.json
1	My Lord. Genbu has begun surfacing.
2	I am aware. It's Pandoria.
3	Then the Prince...?
4	...Yes.
5	We have received reports that he made contact\nwith the Aegis in Indol.
6	So after 500 years, he makes his move...\nPraetor Amalthus.
7	My Lord...?
8	We must act. To protect our days of peace.\nEven if they are a dream that cannot last...
bf06220170_ms.json
1	Whoa...\nIt's just like a bigger version of Turters.
2	It's called Genbu.
3	It's the same, like, Titan-type as Uraya.\nNormally it's submerged in the Cloud Sea.
4	Even in early fall, it can get pretty cold\ninside Tantal. Mind you don't freeze!
5	Brr... I really can't stand the cold...
6	I can provide my own warmth.\nYou can stay close to me if you like.
7	Me as well.
8	You guys are pretty handy to have around.
9	Well, it is our trademark, right?
10	Essentially.
11	Aren't you gonna be cold like that, Shellhead?
12	I'm used to it. I'll be dandy.
13	He's naturally dense, it's good insulation.
14	Oh. Makes sense.
15	Stop encouraging her!\nGang of bullies!
bf06230100_ms.json
1	H-hey, Nia...\nDo you, um, mind...?
2	Hehe, c'mooon, it's not so bad.
3	You're just so warm. I can't help it!
4	It's a function of what's\nknown as "infrared radiation".
5	Gramps knows everything.
6	I'm...not your personal heater, you know...
7	M-my lady...
8	If you desire warmth,\nwhy not take some from me?
9	Miss Pyra seems to be in some distress...
10	No way.
11	Your fur is all stiff and spiky with the cold,\nit'd be murder on my sensitive skin.
12	But, my lady...
13	Hey, is it just me, or are the\nether lines really dim?
14	What is meaning of "ether lines"?
15	Y'know, those things, the glowing\nthreads that run inside a Titan.
16	That is the glow of pure ether\ncoursing through the Titan's body.
17	You can compare it to the bloodstream of a human.
18	You've got good eyes.
19	Genbu has pretty bad circulation,\ncompared to other Titans.
20	They say it's why we have a\ncold climate and awful crops.
21	So it's...cold-blooded?
22	Heh, call it what you like.
bf06230120_ms.json
1	Oh, my- This is the very picture of the\nancient civilizations I've read about!
2	It's a pretty classic look.
3	You know the old land of Torna?
4	They had a proud and noble civilization,\nrivaled only by Judicium at the time.
5	But whereas Judicium were the masters of\nbiological arts...
6	Tornans knew all there was to know about engineering.
7	The proud blood of Torna runs in\nthe veins of us Tantalese.
8	As there are people to pass it on to,\ncivilization will endure.
9	Knowledge is inherited, much like life itself.
10	Nice quote! You should write that down.
11	Thank you.
12	It's not that simple, though.
13	[ML:undisp ]Huh?
14	You'll see...
bf06230170_ms.json
1	Whoa, that's a pretty lively market.
2	It's the black market.
3	Black market?
4	Tantal is so cold, there's precious little\nin the way of local produce to sell.
5	Just look.\nAll the regular shops are shuttered.
6	You're right, they're mostly empty.
7	Instead, folks pay ungodly prices...
8	for produce that's been smuggled\nin from other nations.
9	And since it's the only thing keeping\npeople from actually starving,
10	the bigwigs just turn a blind eye.
11	So most of the agricultural production is wasted\njust surviving, and the country grows weak...
12	Exactly.
13	So even the wisdom of a proud ancient\ncivilization cannot solve all problems...
14	Ancient civilization sounds good and all...
15	but basically, this place is a giant museum with\nno tourists. That's not gonna feed anyone.
bf06240100_ms.json
1	We have been expecting you, Your Highness.
2	Yeah, yeah. Good to see ya.\nIs the old man inside?
3	Indeed. He has been eagerly awaiting your return.
4	Hah! Now I know you're lying.
5	Armus'll fly before that\nman welcomes me home.
6	No need to coddle me, mate.
7	Apologies.
8	Any case, seems he knows we're coming.\nThat'll save time.
9	[ML:undisp ]!
10	Could it be...?
11	Are you all right?
12	Yes.
13	Tora.
14	Uh? But why?
15	It true Poppi able to produce own\nreserves of ether energy, but...
16	I'll explain later.\nFor now, just do as I ask.
17	All right then.\nLeave it to Tora.
bf06250100_ms.json
1	The Aegis...I presume.
2	[ML:undisp ]QUESTION
3	[ML:undisp ]STARTLEMENT?
4	[ML:undisp ]
5	[ML:undisp ]Huh?!
6	Guards?! My lady!
7	[ML:undisp ]GRUNT
8	[ML:undisp ]FAINTING NOISE
9	Wh-what the hell is going on?
10	Shellhead?!
11	N-no idea!\nStop this at once!
12	Dad!
13	Aaagh-!
14	Guaahh-!
15	Rex!
16	[ML:undisp ]TAKES HIT
17	[ML:undisp ]TAKES BIG HIT
18	Urgh... Wh...why...?
19	Pyra!
20	Le-! Let her go!\nPyra! Pyyyraaa!!!
21	Stop this madness!\nWhat's going on?!
22	Rex and his lot haven't done anything!
23	We cannot afford to wait until they do, Zeke.
24	The world must not be allowed to burn.
25	The Aegis must be destroyed!
26	Oh no, you don't...
27	Dromarch! Let's get Rex outta there!
28	Roger!
29	The ether energy!
30	Aagh-!
31	My lady! Aurgh-!
32	Please, do not resist.
33	My goal is only to destroy the Aegis...
34	I have no wish to take your lives also.
35	King Eulogimenos.
36	I stand before you as a special envoy of Mor Ardain.\nThe Emperor sent me here himself.
37	Do you realize what you are doing?
38	I am quite aware.\nAnd prepared to face the consequences.
39	Prepared...?
bf06260100_ms.json
1	Why?\nWhy do you have to bump Pyra off?
2	I see you still speak like a commoner.
3	What's that got to do with anything?\nDon't change the subject.
4	What if I told you I act for justice?
5	What are you trying to say?
6	You could say...\nI'm doing this for Alrest.
7	Say what now...?!
8	Follow me.
bf06270100_ms.json
1	Th-this is...
2	This is...the legacy of our royal line.
3	You can't be serious...
4	Why...?\nFather, why?!
bf06280100_ms.json
1	Ukh-!
2	...Move!
3	Wild Roar!
4	It's no use.
5	It appears the flow of ether energy\nis being blocked off.
6	Dammit!
7	While we're doing this, Pyra is...!
8	We have to do something!
9	There is no point, Rex.\nYou're just wasting your strength.
10	Both the walls and floor are built to withstand\ngreat force. We cannot make a dent in them.
11	Let's calm down a bit, Rex.
12	If we think calmly, we'll come up with something!\n...Grr!
13	Hey, you lot! Can you try to help us out here?!
14	Your efforts are pointless.
15	The way they built this place...\nIt's essentially one giant stasis web.
16	Stasis web...\nLike those nets you used in Torigoth?
17	To lock Drivers up together with their Blades,\nand even leave us our weapons...
18	They must have the utmost confidence.
19	Perhaps we could break through, given enough time...
20	But by then it will be too late and the Aegis will be disposed of.
21	..."Disposed of"...?!
22	That's all the more reason you should give us a bloody hand!
23	I said it's pointless.
24	[ML:undisp ]Grr.
25	We won't get anywhere...\nwith brute force, that is.
26	Huh?
bf06290100_ms.json
1	So what now, my Prince?
2	This pisses me right off...
3	Um, say what?
4	I said, I'm pissed off!
5	Doing it for the world, my arse.\nHow self-serving can you get...?
6	How d'you mean...?
7	This country's strangling itself to death\nwith its own web of lies and excuses!
8	But just maybe...our chum could break it free...
9	Rex could?
10	No faith, eh?
11	Hey, whatever. If you believe in him,\nmy Prince, I'm with you all the way.
12	That kid's heart is pure.
13	Too pure for his own good, sometimes.
14	But isn't it our duty as adults\nto give him a little help with that?
15	Probably.\nYou know, this is what I like about you.
16	This won't be easy...
17	Oh quit it with your drama!\nWhen is anything ever easy for you?
18	[ML:undisp ]Adlib laugh
19	Heh. Let's go!
bf06300100_ms.json
1	OK, that should do it.
2	Preparations complete!
3	What's going on? Tora?
4	Oho-ho!\nBoth Drivers and Blades...
5	use ether energy to deploy Arts, yes?
6	You can skip the lecture, Tora.\nEveryone knows that.
7	But right now friends cannot, yes?
8	Yeah, there's something about this room...
9	Oho-ho-ho! But Rex-Rex and friends\nforgetting one very important thing!
10	Hurry up, would you? Just spit it out, furball!
11	Could be friends forgetting,\nPoppi is artificial Blade?
12	Why would we forget that?\nShe's been with us all this time...
13	...Wait! I get it!\nHer ether furnace!
14	Rex correct.
15	Thanks to friend Mòrag, Poppi now able\nto generate own supply of ether energy.
16	Nothing barrier can do anything about.
17	Tora transfer crystal from sword\nof Mòrag to Biter of Poppi.
18	That crystal have enough energy\nstored for one use of Arts.
19	And Biter of Poppi use Earth element.
20	So through synergy with Fire element\nof Mòrag, power of Arts is amplified!
21	If we hit it straight on,\nI doubt the door can withstand that.
22	Wait a minute...\nYou stored energy in that crystal?
23	How is that possible with a barrier...?
24	Aha!
25	Lady Mòrag has not used a single Art\nsince we arrived in this place!
26	[ML:undisp ]Wha-?!
27	I had my suspicions ever since we entered the palace.
28	So I secretly asked Tora to refrain\nfrom using any Arts either.
29	Oho-ho-ho!
30	I see now.
31	If our enemies knew Poppi retains her power inside\nthe barrier, they would keep us on a tighter leash.
32	Exactly.\nHere goes. Step back.
33	Hold up!
34	If you transferred the crystal from the sword,\nwhat will you fight with?
35	I can generate a new one from Brighid's core.
36	...?\nDon't tell me you didn't know about that.
37	[ML:undisp ]Whoa...
38	Seriously? You don't even know\nhow Blade weapons work? Give me a break.
39	How...would I know something like that?!
40	I've never lost or broken my weapon!
41	Then I suppose I cannot blame you.
42	Moving along, then...\nTora, Poppi, please?
43	With pleasure!
44	Poppi power!
45	Jeeeeet Biter!!!
46	We did it!
47	We the best!
48	You made quite some noise, too.\nIt won't be long before the guards arrive!
49	Good point!
50	Lady Pyra was taken below.\nMayhap somewhere beneath the palace?
51	Got it!
bf06310100_ms.json
1	Zeke! Pandoria!
2	Oh, what? We came all this way to bust you out!
3	How inconsiderate!
4	You kept us waiting!
5	Won't you get in trouble for helping us?
6	Eh, I'm the prodigal son anyhow.\nIt can't get any worse.
7	Where's Pyra?
8	This way.\nFollow us.
bf06320100_ms.json
1	Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow...
2	You all right?
3	I'm fine, it's just a scratch.
4	Honestly though, chum, are you\never NOT getting scratched up?
5	Ever since Pyra gave me half her life force and\nwe swore to reach Elysium, things have been rough.
6	But...
bf06320150_ms.json
1	I'm actually glad.
2	They feel like a sign of...our bond, I guess?\nSomething special we share, as Driver and Blade.
3	...
bf06330100_ms.json
1	Urr...nhhh...
2	Where...?
3	(Strung up in some kind of restraint.\nLook ahead...)
4	?!
5	(An ether accelerator.)
6	(I've seen one like it before, in old Torna.)
7	(It certainly seems like they want us gone for good...)
8	(So.)
9	(If we cranked up the output and\nreally focused it...)
10	(we could probably manage one strike.)
11	If the people here really are the\ndescendants of the Tornans...
12	then I have a message for them that I must pass on.
13	(In that case, I'll leave it to you.)
14	Thank you, Mythra.
15	(He's here.)
16	I apologize for this, noble Aegis.\nI have no personal grievance with you.
17	However... For the sake of this world...\nYou must be destroyed where you stand.
18	Is that truly your desire,\nYour Majesty?
19	I believe you desired the same thing yourself, once.
20	Is that not why you disappeared from history\nalong with Addam the hero?
21	[ML:undisp ]...
22	Begin.
23	Pyra!
24	Rex!
25	The ether accelerator!
26	The what now?
27	It's a weapon from long ago...\ndesigned to use Genbu's ether energy for destruction.
28	I never dreamed they'd fully restore it...
29	My old man... He's gonna use it to kill Pyra!
30	No matter how strong she is,\nthere'd be no coming back from that!
31	In that case...we can't let him use it!
bf06340100_ms.json
1	Argh...!\nThere's too many of them!
2	Hurry, or Pyra's toast!
3	I know that! It's just-
4	Forgive me...
5	Dammit! Pyra!!!
6	I won't let you...!
7	It's not enough!
8	Poppi! Activate QT mode! Lift up from below!
9	Understood, Masterpon!
10	Do it! Poppiiii!!!
11	Heeeeave...! Hoooo!
12	It missed?!
13	They did it, Rex!\nThey stopped it!
14	Yeah!
15	Hahh!
16	Pyra!
17	Five hundred years...
18	For five hundred years, we Tantalese have\nconcealed the Omega Fetter...
19	Do you know why?
20	...
21	Our old homeland, Torna, was destroyed\nin the Aegis War.
22	Our hero, Addam, also failed to return...
23	You must understand, old Torna as a country\nwas united around the Hero.
24	But our ancestors, less so...
bf06350100_ms.json
1	What're you saying? That we're not Addam's bloodline?
2	Precisely.\nIn Torna, our family were just a cadet branch.
3	We only gained our current position in the\nconfusion of the war's aftermath.
4	But then...we're just a bunch of usurpers!
5	They were desperate times.
6	We had no choice.\nThe nation must continue at all costs.
7	Even if it meant claiming Addam's name?
8	With its guiding force gone,\nmuch blood was spilled in Torna.
9	We did what had to be done to reunite\nit under the new banner of Tantal...
bf06360100_ms.json
1	Legends of the hero who saved the world\nare deeply ingrained in people's hearts...
2	And you used them for your own political agenda?
3	Even so.
4	All was done in the name of saving the\nworld from burning once more.
5	Don't you dare try and sugarcoat it.
6	Short story is, they saw an opportunity\nto gain influence, and they took it!
7	Grrr.
8	That is the way of the world.
9	Mor Ardain could easily take a similar path.
10	Yes...we are in no position to condemn them outright.
11	So did this Addam guy really never return?
12	Indeed...
13	The records indicate he went missing\nimmediately after sealing away the Aegis.
14	It is likely he simply perished\nduring the journey home.
15	...He didn't just go missing.
16	What did you say, Aegis?
17	Addam... He had foreseen everything.
18	He knew what would happen to the people\nafter the kingdom fell.
19	But...he chose not to return.
20	Addam left us of his own will?\nBut why?
21	...Hear me, my scions.\nI am Addam Origo.
22	This day I seal the Aegis away from the world.
23	But this seal is not for eternity.
24	In anticipation of the day that humanity\nbecomes worthy of the Aegis's power...
25	I entrust her to posterity.
26	She is our hope...
27	When mankind has matured,\nand learned to live better lives...
28	she will answer your call, and return to you.
29	Trusting that day will come,\nI leave my final wish to you...
30	Addam foresaw much confusion and\nhardship in the world ahead.
31	And when I seemed unsure, he told me something.
32	"This is a trial..."
bf06370100_ms.json
1	Is me sleeping a part of the trial?
2	That's right...
3	It is a trial for us humans.\nOne we must overcome ourselves.
4	If we cannot do that, we don't\ndeserve to live alongside you.
bf06380100_ms.json
1	Live alongside...
2	To be honest,\nI still don't fully understand what he meant by that...
3	Whether he simply meant the coexistence of\nhumans and Blades, or something more...
4	But I think he made a difficult choice.
5	For the sake of everyone's survival...
6	Whoa!
7	Your Majesty!
8	What is this?!
9	It's Genbu...
10	It's broken free of our control and\nstarted to dive into the clouds!
11	What? Are you certain?!
12	Ungh-!
13	Pandy!
14	O-oh, no...
15	What exactly is happening?
16	Could it be...that blast...?!
17	Old man!
18	What is he...?
19	Tantal keeps Genbu under control using the Omega Fetter.
20	But firing the ether accelerator...
21	It could've created a counter-flow\nin Genbu's ether conduits...
22	causing a critical overload.
23	...So Genbu's broken?
24	Oh no. My words can't reach him anymore...
25	Genbu is just going to dive deeper and deeper...\nThen...
26	Dumb old git! That's what happens when you use\nantiquated parts!
27	The Cloud Sea has a similar density to water.
28	As we dive, the pressure will keep building.
29	By 500 peds, a human would be crushed completely...
30	And all that force will weigh down on Genbu?
31	What's our depth now?!
32	Twenty-two hundred peds, Sir!
33	We are diving at a rate of 120 peds per minute!
34	And Genbu's depth limit?
35	25,000, give or take...
36	...That'd give us just over three hours.
37	Whoa, Shellhead's good at maths...
38	Bite me.
39	This ain't good.
40	Hey, chum. There's a pressure-resistant pod in the\npalace's southern tower.
41	You guys at least should get in and escape.
42	What about you and everyone else?
43	Don't worry about us.
44	How can I possibly not worry about you?!
45	Isn't there any other way?\nSome way to save everyone?!
46	Only Pandoria can tell Genbu what to do.
47	If it won't budge for her, it's no use.
48	Apart from that, all we can do is try to evacuate\nas many people as we can...
49	But with just three hours...
50	I think you mentioned before...\nYou control Genbu using the Omega Fetter, right?
51	Uh, yeah, but...
52	Where is it?
53	Inside Genbu's head.
54	It's straight south from the palace,\nthrough Genbu's spinal column.
55	I will go.
56	You'll go?\nPyra, what are you-
57	The Omega Fetter is originally\nOphion's control core.
58	And Ophion is my Artifice.
59	I can't be 100% sure, but I think\nI might be able to fix it.
60	Pyra...
61	Pyra being serious?
62	They try to kill Pyra one minute ago!
63	That's a totally separate issue.\n...Isn't that what you'd say, Rex?
64	Wha-? Oh, yeah. I guess it is.
65	And that's why.
66	Friend Pyra...
67	Tora get it. Then Tora and\nPoppi also lend help!
68	Looks like we're in too. Dromarch?
69	I would have it no other way.
70	That's settled then.\nStay out of our way, old man! Got it?
71	You would all...risk your lives for this?
72	For the sake of Tantal, though we\nattempted to destroy the Aegis?
73	It's not about Tantal.
74	Then why?
75	You're a king, right?\nYou ought to be able to figure it out.
76	Rex, you are...
77	Mòrag?
78	You leave me little choice.
79	Zeke, where was the Fetter again?\nHow do we get there?
80	I won't just tell ya.\nI'll take you right to it!
81	Zeke...
82	Save it, old man. You better make a start on\nevacuating the people.
83	Though, with us on the case...
84	Your efforts are probably going to be wasted!
85	...Understood.
86	No time for chit-chat.\nLet's go!
87	Yeah!
bf06420100_ms.json
1	Lady Mòrag, you're making that face again.
2	If you keep frowning like that,\nyou'll get wrinkles.
3	...I just don't get it.
4	Tantal was founded by the counter-Addamites.
5	Then, after the war, they closed themselves off.
6	But...the way the king was acting...\nI can't help feeling there's something more to it.
7	What, though?
8	It was the Praetorium who sent us here on this mission.
9	Why would he go to such lengths to reject it...?
10	It seemed almost like he wanted to\ncut ties with them...
11	You think Indol is holding\nsomething else over Tantal?
12	That would be an explanation, yes...\nZeke, do you know anything useful?
13	Nope. There's no records from back then.
14	How about you?
15	There is nothing in my journal from that period.
16	I might have been returned to my core\nfor some reason or other.
17	Do you know anything about those days, Gramps?
18	Mmm...?\nNoo, I was somewhere else at the time.
19	And matters of human kingdoms and so on\ndidn't interest me much.
20	Geez Gramps, what's the point of keeping an old-timer\nlike you around if you don't even know anything?!
21	Sometimes, it's funny how much you sound like Corinne.
22	So you think the king wasn't telling us everything?
23	There is a chance.
24	Do you think it may be related to Jin\nand his comrades using Torna's name?
25	"If you saw the last state of humanity, you'd understand.\nNow that you have come this far..."
bf06440100_ms.json
1	The last state...
2	[ML:undisp ]Huh?
3	Jin said something about the last state of humanity.\nI thought he meant, like, an evolution...
4	y'know, in the future...
5	but maybe he meant the previous state of humanity?
6	And that is the key to why they fight...?
7	Mm.
8	If... If that is the case...
9	Perhaps I...never should have been\nsealed away after all...
bf06450100_ms.json
1	What is this place?
2	A battleground from the Aegis War...
3	There are many things here I remember...
4	The walls and floors are melted...\nMust've been a hell of a battle.
5	Ophion isn't the only Artifice.
6	You've already seen one other -\nSiren, the one Mythra commands.
7	But during the war, there were\ncountless Artifices, wielded by Malos.
bf06470100_ms.json
1	So it's a site of a fight against him...
2	Say, what are these Artifices, anyway?
3	We've only actually met Ophion.
4	We've never even seen Siren, just\nthat light thing it shoots down.
5	They're a power granted to the Aegises.\nDivine swords sleeping in Elysium, far above us all.
6	Hold on. I thought Elysium was a\nparadise, not a scary weapon stash?
7	...I don't know.
8	Whaddya mean, you don't know?
9	All that I can find in the corners of my memory\nis that townscape...
10	I don't know why Father\ncreated me, or created the Artifices...
11	That's what I want to find out...
12	Pyra...
13	It's OK. We'll find out once we get there.
14	I don't think...
15	Open a chest, it might turn out great...
16	But until then, it's just a crate!
17	That's rule 4 of the Salvager's Code! Haha.
18	Rex...
19	Comparing Elysium to\ndirty old sea junk...
bf06480100_ms.json
1	My Prince, look over there.
2	Would you look at that. I guess we've arrived.
3	Whoa, it looks way older than the palace...
4	Yes, it seems untouched by the ravages of time...
bf06490100_ms.json
1	That's it.
2	Looks like a Core Crystal...
3	Is that the Omega Fetter...?
4	Yes. That's Ophion's control core.
5	It was originally a conduit that I\nused to communicate with Ophion.
6	We have to hurry.
7	Yes, you're right.
8	[ML:undisp ]...
9	Well? Can you fix it?
10	Shut up.
11	I'm sorry...
12	Hmmm...
13	...Mythra?
14	Whoa...
15	In that case...
16	Are we...rising?
17	All right! Prince, I've told Genbu to resume\ncircling the Cloud Sea once he's done rising.
18	Nice.\nLooks like we made it after all.
19	Oh! Great news!
20	Phew, Tora was not look forward to\nbecoming flat as Argentum Monkfish.
21	A job well done, eh?
22	Hey, Rex.\nYou can remove that thing now.
23	Hm.
bf06490150_ms.json
1	So it was hidden all the way out here...\nNo wonder we couldn't find it.
2	[ML:undisp ]What-!
3	I'd just been wondering whether it was time to make an exit...\nThanks for saving me the trouble.
4	Lovely to see that tedious woman isn't\nhere to get in our way this time!
5	Care to join me in a dance of death, Nia?
6	I think I just threw up in my mouth a bit.
7	Mean little girl.
8	You've come for the Fetter, haven't you.
9	Perceptive, kid.
10	Condescending much?\nIt's not like there's anything else here.
11	You are SO mean.
12	Now, hand it over nicely...
13	...would be the classic line, but no.
14	I'm not letting you escape with your lives.\nFor Jin's sake.
15	Where are Jin and Malos, anyway?\nThere are a few things I need to ask them.
16	Frankly, I don't think they've got much interest\nin what you have to say.
17	Sure about that?
18	Quite sure, yes.
19	Not to interrupt the verbal sparring...
20	but how do you plan on doing anything\nwithout your Blades?
21	We're no pushovers, you know.
22	Oh, we're quite aware of that.
23	We just don't need them, you see.
24	Explain yourself.
25	Core Crystals?!
26	They're Blades?!
27	Worse- Flesh Eaters...
28	Bravo! Very good!
29	We've had many an interruption in the past...
30	but here, that seems less likely.\nSo let's go all out.
31	You can try, but I assure you, we won't go down easy.
32	I wouldn't have it any other way.
33	Like I said,\nall out.

1	Inconceivable!\nHow could we...
2	These rats...
3	Warned ya, didn't we? You mess with\nThunderbolt Zeke, that's whatcha get.
4	You brought this on yourselves.
5	Ughhh...

20	Relax, he's not made of glass.
21	Malos?!
22	Don't mind me, I'm just a spectator.
23	He, on the other hand, insisted on coming here...
24	to settle a score.
25	Jin did?
26	Correct.\nYou will give me both the Omega Fetter and the Aegis.
27	You just try and take 'em!\nI know you're strong...
28	but there's no way we're giving you Pyra or Mythra!
29	You have power, boy.\nBut words do little.
30	If you know what you desire, you will have to show it...
31	not with words, but with your own strength!
32	Is that Jin's true form?!
33	What enormous energy...
34	There no change to ether energy of surroundings.
35	That energy being emitted from\ninterior of body.
36	Just like our Pyra, then?\nWhere do they even keep all that energy?
37	How about all that rage energy he's got\nall pent up inside?
38	No, that's not it... It's...

81	You'll do what, exactly?
82	I will...
83	annihilate myself.
84	What?!
85	You need me alive...
86	don't you, Malos?

90	Are you so sure...about that?

4	If I hadn't attempted to destroy the Aegis,\nthey would never have...
5	If you'd done nothing, they'd\nhave come for her anyway.
6	You're not to blame, Your Majesty.
7	It's...my fault.
8	Five hundred years ago...
9	This kingdom was rent in twain.
10	Some followed Addam, who sought to\nlive with Blades and Titans as equals.
11	Others opposed him, preferring to consider\nhumans as the masters and Titans as our tools.
12	When Addam returned to the ether,\nhis rivals seized power.
13	Leveraging the power of the Omega Fetter,\nthey declared themselves...
14	the Tantalese royal dynasty.
15	Claiming they were the hero Addam's descendants.
16	Precisely.
17	My ancestors merely used the name of the beloved\nAddam in order to win over the people.
18	[ML:undisp ]...
19	Before long, we resolved to protect\nourselves from meddlesome foreigners,
20	by descending deep into the Cloud Sea.
21	Taking the dirty secret of our\nfamily's lineage with us.
22	The Praetorium, for their part, did not protest.
23	Can you guess why?
24	No.
25	They offered to stay silent in\nexchange for a certain resource...
26	An annual tribute...\ncomprising a fixed quantity of Core Chips.
27	!
28	I have something I wish to show you.
29	What is it?
bf07110150_ms.json
1	What IS this?
2	This is Genbu's ether flow.
3	The Titan draws in the fabric of the Cloud\nSea and uses it as a source of energy.
4	This energy flows throughout\nthe Titan's body in the form of ether.
5	Refining and crystallizing this ether creates\nCore Chips.
6	This process is what you see before you.
7	So in other words, you're siphoning\naway a portion of the Titan's energy.
8	Our cold climate and poor harvests -\nthey are the unfortunate side effects of this process.
9	I think I'm beginning to understand...
10	Core Chips are vital to every nation's\nmilitary and energy policies.
11	The Praetorium desired this power.
12	How come?
13	Alrest at the time was in crisis.
14	But for the Praetorium, it was a precious chance\nto expand their sphere of influence.
15	So they...muscled in.
16	As a result, Tantal fell into a\nchronic energy shortage.
17	Then... Well, you saw for yourselves.
18	Near-frozen earth. Failing crops.
19	The Tantalese people are forced to\nlive in abject poverty.
20	So why not just leave the Cloud Sea?
21	Genbu can move, right?\nJust go somewhere warmer.
22	They fear contact with other nations.
23	Too afraid it might expose the truth behind\nthe legends they spun about Addam.
24	That would explain their isolationism.
25	Indeed. That was five centuries ago.
26	Now the Aegis has awakened, the Praetorium\nis demanding we hand over the Omega Fetter.
27	They are threatening to reveal our secret if\nwe do not acquiesce.
28	Indol are threatening you?!
29	I get it now.\nThat's what was in that letter.
30	Enough was enough!
31	I couldn't stand by and let the Tantalese people\nsuffer any longer.
32	Therefore, I made a decision.
33	And that's why you-
34	Yes.
35	I knew there was a chance that the Praetorium\nwould use the Aegis against us.
36	But if I could neutralize her power, perhaps\nwe would stand a chance of opposing them.
37	And perhaps by saving my people from poverty, I\ncould absolve the sins of my forefathers.
38	You didn't think about using the Aegis's\npower yourself?
39	Wielding such power is beyond my means.
40	I am under no illusions.
41	However, does the same apply to you?
42	I felt something. When I looked in your eyes, I knew.
43	Perhaps you are the one to whom we\ncan entrust the Aegis's power.
44	Father...
45	In the end it seems I only managed\nto make things worse.
46	I can blame nothing but my own judgment.
47	This tome records the deeds of the hero Addam.
48	According to this, he saved the world\nfrom destruction using a white sword.
49	And then disappeared, along with a red sword.
50	White and red...
51	It must mean Mythra and Pyra's swords.
52	Whoever wrote this must have\nhad a personal connection to Addam.
53	And most curiously...
54	After Addam disappeared, the author of this\nbook went looking for something.
55	Something?
56	The third Aegis sword.
57	There's a third?
58	Apparently this sword was as transparent as\ndiamond, and gave off a clear, brilliant light.
59	But Addam went his whole life without\nusing the sword.
60	In fact, he could not use it.
61	What do you mean, 'couldn't'?
62	The sword was simply too powerful.
63	Even he, the legendary hero, could\nnot contain the power it commanded.
64	And thus, fearing its power,\nhe sealed it away somewhere.
65	The author therefore surmised...
66	...that this sword alone was the\none true sword of the Aegis.
67	[ML:undisp ]?!
68	Now, Rex. You were defeated by Jin.\nDoubtless that man is a powerful warrior...
69	But even so, can this be right?
70	Can the Aegis herself truly be\noutmatched by a single opposing Blade?
71	Would it not make more sense to presume...
72	...that you lost because you have yet to unlock\nthe true power of the Aegis?
73	You mean...I'm the one who's been holding them back...?
74	Your Majesty! Where is that sword?
75	We have to...We have to find it somehow!
76	We have to find that sword, and rescue Pyra and Mythra!
77	Regrettably, the book does not specify\nthe sword's location.
78	But there must be...
79	However, reading between the lines,\nit seems the author suspected...
80	...that the sword lies somewhere in Leftheria.
81	It's not much, but that's where I would\nbegin the search.
82	In Leftheria...
83	Are you ready?
84	Huh?
85	Are you ready to do what it takes\nto be their true Driver?
86	Gramps?
87	Well? Are you, Rex?
88	Yes! Of course!
89	I'm going to be the Driver that Pyra\nand Mythra deserve!
90	And then I'm going to take them to Elysium!
91	Then come with me.\nI'll show you the way.
92	My son.
93	Yeah?
94	I have a favor, to ask of you as your king.
95	Well that's a first.\nAre you feeling okay, old man?
96	Maybe you're coming down with something.
97	The Aegis needs...
98	No, rather, the boy needs protection.
99	You mean Rex?
100	Yes. I saw...something, in that boy's eyes.
101	A light that must...never go out.
102	Heh. Steady on, old man.\nPeople will get the wrong idea.
103	...Fine. Leave it to me.
104	Thank you.
105	Meh, it's not like I wasn't gonna go with him anyway.
bf07120100_ms.json
1	You really can't judge a book by its cover.
2	Who'd have thought that sweet-looking girl\nwould threaten to destroy herself?
3	Didn't she realize taking her own life\nwould mean the boy died, too?
4	Oh, she knew exactly what she was doing.
5	The whole thing was a bluff, then?
6	No, not at all.\nThe reason she gave her Core Crystal to the boy...
7	...was to replace his heart after Jin put paid to it.
8	An Aegis core encodes the\nblueprints for all life.
9	She took advantage of that.
10	Incredible.\nI had no idea such a thing was possible.
11	Aegises truly are a breed apart.
12	Cores are constantly accumulating data\nabout the outside world.
13	The fact that their injuries are mirrored is a result of\ntheir twin cores exchanging information.
14	If you wanted to be poetic about it, you could\nsay that their very lives are intertwined.
15	But there's nothing to stop\nher from severing that link.
16	What do you mean?
17	Before issuing the kill order to the Artifice, she would've\ntransferred the remainder of her core to the boy.
18	Letting him live on, heart complete.
19	An Aegis can survive for a short time\nwithout a Core Crystal.
20	Don't ask me why. It's just how we were made.
bf07140100_ms.json
1	Ah, so that's the reason Jin agreed to her terms.
2	He couldn't care less about the boy.
3	But he wasn't about to lose this one.\nSimple as that.
bf07150100_ms.json
1	What are we doing here?
2	Did you know Fonsett has another name?
3	Huh?
4	Hero's Rest.
5	Hero? As in...?
6	Indeed.
7	Fonsett Village was founded by Addam himself\nat the end of his travels.
8	After the war, Addam charged me with\nprotecting the village.
9	Was this village really that important?
10	What do you think I was protecting?
11	You mean it's...
12	Follow me.
bf07160100_ms.json
1	The Village Guardian?
2	Just looks like a stone pillar to me.
3	They say that the village's guardian spirit dwells within.
4	Gramps, what are we doing here?
5	Rex, try turning the stone tablet clockwise.
6	This? Hn-ng!
7	Huh? This crest, it's...
8	I've seen it before!
9	Place your hand on it.
10	Here goes.
11	Wh-what's this?
12	This passage leads into the very center\nof the archipelago.
13	There lies the cavern known as Spirit Crucible Elpys.
14	That's quite a name...
15	This entrance and the gate of\nthe Spirit Crucible...
16	are sealed in such a way that only\na Leftherian can open them.
17	Ahhh...\nSo that's why Jin needed me back then!
18	When Addam founded this village,
19	he hid something deep within the body of the Titan\nthat forms the archipelago's center.
20	You mean the missing sword?
21	Mm... I don't know how word of it got out,
22	but many were led here\nby rumors of the legendary sword.
23	More than a few have entered the Spirit Crucible-
24	but none have ever returned.
25	Is it really that dangerous?
26	Addam wanted to ensure that the sword was securely\nsealed away.
27	He put many measures in place to stop it falling\ninto the wrong hands.
28	Only the hands of someone worthy.
29	Addam said that taking this sword would be the mark of\nthe Aegis's true Driver.
30	Their...true Driver...
31	What do you say, Rex?
32	I'll do it. No.\nI...HAVE to do it.
33	Every moment we waste, Pyra and Mythra could be...
34	Then you're ready for what lies ahead?
bf07190100_ms.json
1	If you hadn't interfered back then...
2	Neither of us would've had\nto go through all this.
3	Now then...
4	Time to take back what I lost 500 years ago.
bf07200100_ms.json
1	How he's still alive with his Crystal in that state...
2	Seriously, it's not normal.
3	The Aegis is the Master Blade.
4	The first Blade the Architect forged.
5	Malos can do things we can only dream of.
6	And? How's he going to restore his core exactly?
7	He'll extract the data he's missing from the core of\nthe other Aegis. Then all his power will be restored.
8	Mhmm.\nOK. So what will that do to her?
9	Heheh... Well, if she's lucky, she'll live.\nHeh. As an empty husk, that is.
10	Rough deal.\nMalos doesn't hold back, huh?
bf07210100_ms.json
1	Don't blame me for this.\nIt's our Father who made us this way.
2	But don't worry...\nOnce I meet him, I'll get the answers we're after.
3	I need to know why we're like this...
4	In any case, this world only needs one Aegis.\nDon't you agree, Pyra?
5	Ugh...
bf07220100_ms.json
1	Urghh!
2	Dromarch! What're you stumbling for?
3	Sorry, my lady.\nI've been feeling a little dizzy...
4	You too?
5	You too, Lady Brighid?
6	Yes, for a little while now.\nThough I'm still capable of standing.
7	Hey, same here!
8	What's up with this place?\nIt's kinda creepy.
9	What is going on here?
10	I feared as much...
11	Gramps...you knew this would happen?
12	The tales say that Spirit Crucible Elpys\nsaps the strength of Blades.
13	It's one of the reasons why none\nhave ever returned from its depths.
14	I say-
15	Ether flow scarce in this area.\nThat may be cause of problems.
16	Like that time in the Tantalese palace?
17	That not only thing.
18	Glowing particles in air...\nThey absorb ether. That is source of light.
19	So not only do you have less power,\nthe power you DO have is being absorbed?
20	Well that's jolly tragic.
21	You all right, Poppi?
22	Poppi just fine.\nPoppi never better.
23	Of course, you're an artificial Blade, ain'tcha?
bf07230100_ms.json
1	We have to cross that?
2	Yes. But we must proceed with caution.
3	Once we enter, the Blades will be sapped of most of\ntheir power.
4	If they run out of energy, they might be forced to\nreturn to their core state.
5	And there's a chance they could never be reawakened.
6	Pandy, you'd better just stay here and guard the fort.
7	Why just me? Don't you want me?
8	Don't ask dumb questions.\nYou know very well why, don't you?
9	If I'm staying, you ought to stay-
10	I'll be fine. When am I ever not?
11	If you're going, I'm-
12	I'm ordering you to stay here!
13	Is there something wrong?
14	Pandoria was just agreeing to stay behind.
15	Nuh-uh. I'm going with you!
16	We made a promise, didn't we?!\nDon't you dare say you've forgotten!
17	[ML:undisp ]
18	I go where you go.\nEnd of story.
19	Fine.
20	My lady...
21	I'm fine. We can't give up now we've come this far.
22	Don't. I know what you're gonna say.
23	I... Understood.
24	I don't know what's in there.
25	But apart from Tora and Poppi, we're all going to\nfind our abilities severely weakened.
26	Be careful, Rex.
27	Yes... Healing Arts are going to be less effective, too.
28	One nasty wound and that'll be the end of you.
29	Yeah, I get that.\nTora, Poppi, we'll need you on the front line.
30	You got it, Rex-Rex!
31	Poppi is artificial Blade, so request is very\nextremely not a problem!
32	Technology save the day!\nThree cheers for Nopon know-how!
33	Where are Poppi's cheers?
34	*chuckle* Thanks, guys!
bf07240100_ms.json
1	[ML:undisp ]*pant* *pant*
2	Are you...all right?
3	Never...better!\nI'm...right as...rain!
4	The deeper we go, the thicker these particles get.
5	You can still turn back.
6	Thanks. Your concern is touching.
7	Worry about yourself, yeah? I can look after her.
8	Zeke, you don't look so good yourself.\nIs something wrong?
9	Huh? Oh, yeah...\nI didn't think it was worth mentioning, but...
10	How did you get that?
11	I told you about the time I almost\nbloody died, right?
bf07250100_ms.json
1	My Prince! Zeke!\nNot like this! Not here!
2	Not far now. Just a little further!\nYou can do it!
3	Just...leave me...\nGo on...without me...
4	No!
5	If you die I'll turn back into a Core Crystal!
6	I don't want to forget everything!
7	Pandy...I'm sorry...
8	I hope...your next Driver...is better...than me...
9	I don't want another Driver!\nYou're...you're good enough!
10	Prince!\nZEKE!
bf07250150_ms.json
1	I refuse to forget our 10 years together!\nIt's not going to happen!
2	I'm not...letting you die...here...
3	Uh... Wha... Bandits?
4	Sucks...\nI don't want to be a bandit's Blade...
5	But...I guess I won't remember anyway...
6	...Prince...
bf07260100_ms.json
1	Prince?
2	Fear not. He is going to be fine.
3	You...you saved him?
4	The fact that you're alive is proof of that, is it not?
5	[ML:undisp ]Ah!
6	I had to transplant part of your Core Crystal\ninto his heart.
7	His wounds were grave.\nIt was the only way to save you both.
bf07260150_ms.json
1	I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
2	Actually, I'm glad.
3	What? Why?
4	Knowing that a part of me is keeping you alive...\nI dunno, it's just nice.
5	Pandy...
6	What is it?
bf07270100_ms.json
1	They do that in Indol?
2	I guess you and I are more alike than you thought, chum.
3	Though mine was just a surgical procedure.
4	You make it sound so simple.\nI'm still trying to wrap my head around it.
5	You know the people of Indol can trace their\nroots back to Judicium?
6	Judicium?
7	The creators of that Titan weapon thing\nfrom Temperantia?
8	Yeah, them.\nThey carried out experiments...
9	Fusing Blade and human cells.\nCreating Flesh Eaters.
10	So...those practices persist in Indol?
11	Hey, so they took advantage of Blade regeneration...
12	and patched me up with Pandy's Core Crystal, right?
13	Since I have part of her core in me...
14	I'm a Flesh- no, a Blade Eater! Or something.
15	[ML:undisp ]*chuckle*
16	A Blade Eater...
17	That's right.\nThat's gotta be why this place is getting to you, too.
18	It's all good.\nLet's just push on!
bf07280100_ms.json
1	[ML:undisp]
2	My lady?
3	For the last time, I'm fine.\nWhy don't you just worry about yourself?
4	But-
5	You gotta admire Shellhead over there.\nHe just put it right out there.
6	[ML:undisp ]Hmm?
7	And here I am...
8	Dromarch.
9	I'm gonna put myself to the test.\nRight here. I've decided.
10	My lady-
11	Very well.
12	This mist makes me feel like I'm\nswimming through the Cloud Sea.
13	This mist is produced when a fossilized Titan body\nreacts with the atmosphere.
14	It's why it's so hard to breathe down here.
15	[ML:undisp]
16	Nia?
17	What now?
18	Are you in pain?
19	I'm strugglin' to breathe like everyone else.
20	And I'm a little dizzy, that's all.
21	Oh right...
22	When that happens, it's best to just try and\nempty your head of all thoughts.
23	What?
24	It's an old salvager trick.
25	When you swim down deep, it feels like your\nhead's gonna implode.
26	You just go with it, don't fight it.\nThen you stop noticing the pressure.
27	Why not give it a go?
28	Empty my head, eh?
29	You mean I have to start acting as\ndaft as you?
30	Tall order.
31	Hey, that's not very nice!
32	Everyone! Over here!
33	Tora think this way lead down.
34	It certainly doesn't look like a natural formation.
35	Maybe it was grave robbers?
36	There's not too much worth stealing round here.\nWell, apart from...
37	Whatever it was that Addam hid down here.
38	Just a guess.
39	It's possible that Jin and his accomplices\nhave been here.
40	Then...they found out about the sunken ship,\nand went to Argentum.
41	Still just a guess, but a pretty good one.
42	Then there won't be anything left\nto find, will there? Sheesh.
43	Well, if that was the case then you'd expect them to\nalready have the third sword.
44	But they clearly don't have it.
45	No, I do not think Addam would let\nthe sword be so easily found.
46	No point in worrying.\nLet's just press on!
bf07290100_ms.json
1	Rex.
2	We've come a long way. I think it's time for a break.
3	What? But-
4	Hold your horses. There's a long way to go yet.
5	Hey, you too, Nia. Come rest your head on my lap if you like.
6	Why don't you rest your head in your arse?
7	I'm sorry, everyone. I had no idea.
8	There is no need to apologize.\nI understand.
9	Poppi, now is good time to cool drive furnace!
10	Aye-aye Masterpon!
11	Meeehmehmehmeh! Hothothothot!\nMeehmeh! Hot! Hot!
12	Masterpon! Poppi is sorry!
13	Huh?
14	Emergency air.\nIt might help.
15	Oh, thanks.
16	Ah, not like that!
17	You have to hold your nose, and then\ninhale really deeply.
18	Now stretch out, and puff out your chest.
19	Is this...\n...another of your salvager tricks?
20	Go on, just try it.
21	[ML:undisp ]ADLIB
22	Wow, that really did the trick.
23	Right?
24	When I was starting out, this was one of the\nfirst things the other salvagers taught me.
25	Even though they acted like my parents, they never really\ntaught me anything worthwhile.
26	I did manage to pick up a couple of\nuseful tricks, though.
27	Parents, bleh.
28	My da was real enough but I can't say\nhe really taught me anything either.
29	He was a well-known lord in Gormott.\nA real big cheese.
30	He made me study hard, but it was all how to be a\nproper lady. Which fork to use.
31	Nothing that's doing me any good now.\nJust useless shite.
32	You were some kinda high society princess?\nI can't picture it.
33	Shut it, you.
34	I hated studying.
35	But, looking back...\nThose were the happiest times of my life.
36	There was my da... And...
37	My big sis. The three of us.
38	You had a sister?
39	Yeah. She was very frail.\nI spent a lot of time at her bedside.
40	My da brought doctors from all over to\ntry and help her. He tried so hard.
41	It was all he thought about.
42	After that point...
43	...my memories aren't so happy.
44	Nia...
45	Da spent all his money on chasing a cure,\nand lost his position as a lord.
46	From then on, we became drifters.
47	[ML:undisp ]...
48	It was a tough life. It took its toll on my sister.
49	She died, not long after.
50	Anyway, I'm sorry for talking your ear off.
51	Thanks for the salvager trick. It really worked.
52	Sneaky git. If you had this all along,\nwhy did you hold out on me?
53	[ML:undisp ]ADLIB
54	I feel much better. Shall we go, Rex?
bf07300100_ms.json
1	Hmph.\nLooks like the only way through is by force.
2	Poppi, incendiary barrage!
3	Roger roger!
4	Whoa stop stop stop!
5	You wanna bring the whole cave\ndown on top of us?
6	It was joke.
7	Poppi has no such weaponry.
8	That wasn't funny!
9	Whoa...
10	Does this also have something to do\nwith your connection to the Aegis?
11	No idea.
12	But look!\nNo footprints. We're the first people here.
13	Then there could still be hope.

8	Don't be silly.
9	Don't push yourself. You can rest up a little longer.
10	It's even tougher for you though.\nI'm telling you, I'm fine.
11	After my sister died, it wasn't long before\nmy da died too.
12	Huh?
13	I'm finishing my story.
14	Dromarch was all I had left to remember him.\nWe started wandering together.
15	Or maybe I should say "running".
16	Running?
17	From who? People your dad owed money to?
18	No. From the Praetorium.
19	What? Why?
20	Well...\nIt's a long story.

5	Whew...
6	Then I met Jin.
7	He... He took me in.
8	So that's why you and Jin...
9	In Jin, I saw a way out, y'know?
10	I didn't see a future for myself on my own,\nso I threw my lot in with him.
11	But...
12	I can't see it.
13	What?
14	You're not the kind of person to worry\nabout stuff like that.
15	Well, I wasn't worried, as such.
16	So, anyway. Why the story?
17	I dunno, I was just rambling.
18	Look, I don't know what's burdening you, Nia, but...
19	You shouldn't be afraid.
20	Afraid?
21	Of whatever it is.
22	Stay true to your feelings, even if\nit means fighting tooth and claw.
23	That's who you are, right?
24	What the hell?

5	I've been here before.\nThis is Elysium!

8	Is that so?\nI must offer my gratitude.
9	Eh?
10	You are the one who brought me here.\nI have never been to this place.
11	Once, I sought to come here, but I never did.
12	Oh, really?
13	Neither have I.\nNot... Not yet.
14	It is beautiful.
15	Yeah.
16	Rex, what is it that you seek?
17	Wealth? Power? Dominion?
18	Errr... None of those, really.
19	Though...power might be useful.
20	Power, then?
21	Power to protect...
22	Protect what?
23	That's a long list.
24	Gramps, Nia, Tora, everyone in Fonsett...
25	And Pyra and Mythra.
26	You are greedy, boy.
27	Everyone in Argentum used to tell me that.
28	It is not necessary to protect everything.\nThere is a limit to what one man can do.
29	That's true...
30	But, there is something granted to you especially.
31	Please, tell me what it is.
32	The power to accept her.
33	She is afraid. Of her own power and her terrible destiny.
34	And I, too, was afraid.\nI feared the true power of the Aegis.
35	Heh.

11	Lady Mòrag...
12	You know, I'm sure it could be arranged.
13	Would it...leave a scar?

21	It's all well and good that we escaped,\nbut we've got nothing to show for it.
22	Don't worry. I know where we have to go.
23	Are you sure, Rex? You know Pyra's location?
24	I think so.
25	Near the World Tree.
26	I see a rotting Titan...
27	She's there...
28	A rotting Titan?
29	Could it be?
30	What is it?\nMòrag knows such a place?
31	Close by the World Tree...
32	...against the side of the Great Void...
33	I've heard there's a Titan known\nas the Cliffs of Morytha.
34	Morytha...\nThat name sounds familiar...
35	Lady Mòrag, there are tales...\ntales of a "land of the dead".

25	From all the way up there...
26	Looks like there's some kinda powerful\nupdraft coming from below...
27	It saved us.\nI wonder if it caught the others too.
28	I'm sure it did.
29	Yeah...
30	Still OK?\nLet's get our bearings and then go look for them.
31	We need to find a way out of here...
32	Any ideas?
33	Over there.
34	Are those...the World Tree's roots?
35	Yeah...\nI bet there's a way up there.
36	There has to be.\nI'm good to go. Let's move!
37	Uh, how's Pyra?
38	She's sleeping. Shall I call her?
39	Nah, let her sleep.\nShe's been through a lot.
40	You're too kind.
41	Rule five of the Salvager Code!
42	Always be-
43	I don't think we need to hear it.
44	C'mon! Let's go!
45	Heeey!\nAt least let me finish, spoilsport.
bf08030100_ms.json
1	Really...\nYou got to meet Addam?
2	Yeah. I mean, it's like I have broken\nbits of memory about him.
3	Addam told me something.
4	He told me to fight for the things that I wanted to\nprotect.
5	I made my choice.\nI fight for you and Pyra.
6	I mean, I'm still not good enough for you, but...
7	Don't say that.
8	I've made a choice as well.\nNot to...live in fear.
9	Hey, when you transformed before...
10	That form...it's our true nature.
11	The sword changed, right?
12	Uh? Yeah.
13	It's not just physically stronger.
14	It also lets us control Artifices at will,\nso be careful.
15	Careful?
16	I mean, don't get carried away.
17	I-I see...
18	Which...one of you is it, in that form?
19	Which one?
20	Deep down...
21	It's not one or the other...it's both at once.
22	Like...coffee with milk?
23	What kind of a-
24	*sigh* Something like that, anyway.
25	So you're...\nPythra? Myra?
26	It doesn't matter.
27	Pyra, Mythra, they're both me. Call me whichever.
28	OK. Sure.
29	You can transform at will?
30	If I need to.
31	I see...heheh...
32	What? What are you laughing at?
33	Well...
34	I kinda preferred your hair in that form...
35	It's like that, is it?\nHa... You jerk.
36	That sound...
37	It's the others!\nC'mon!
38	Yeah.
bf08040100_ms.json
1	Guh!\nI can't...
2	I can't lose to these fools!
3	Jin?!
4	He wound up here too?!
5	[ML:undisp ]Gah!
6	[ML:undisp ]Rough breathing at the completion of battle
7	He's still wounded from before?
8	[ML:undisp ]Ugh...!
9	Rex?!
10	You?!
11	You can't move, right?
12	I can't just let you die here.\nEven if you are my enemy!
13	Mythra!
14	If we must...
15	But don't kid yourself that I think this\nis a good idea, Rex!
bf08050100_ms.json
1	But why did you help me...\nI'm...
2	Our enemy?\nYeah, we know that...
3	Even so, it would have been wrong.
4	I just thought, I can't let it end like that...
5	And...
bf08070100_ms.json
1	No...it's nothing.
2	[ML:undisp ]...
3	[ML:undisp ]Hmph...
4	H-hey!
5	Wha—?!
6	Those flames!
7	You've got a lot to learn.
8	You've got to burn these monsters up.
9	That, or smash their Core Crystal.
10	Otherwise, they'll keep coming.
11	Brighid! Poppi! Gramps!
12	Rex?\nAre you OK?
13	Poppi find friends!
14	B-but...Jin?!
15	...
bf08080100_ms.json
1	Oh really...\nSo you lost Tora and the others?
2	It's fine!\nMasterpon is not as soft as he look!
3	It's faint, but I can feel the energy signature of Mòrag's\nweapons. She must be here too...
4	OK! Let's rest up, then go look for them.
5	Hey, Rex.\nWhat about that scumbag there?
6	Ah...\nI think I beat him up pretty bad in that fight.
7	I couldn't just leave him to die.
8	I thought it'd be something like that...
9	Ah... Your sweet, bleeding heart!
10	So. What are we going to do?
11	Uh...
12	Mythra, maybe you could, uh...
13	Fine! Whatever!\nGimme a sec...
14	Incredible!\nWhat awesome power you've acquired!
15	This is the power of the Master Blade!
16	The Master Blade possesses the data\nof all Blade cores.
17	!!
18	This is...?!
19	What's wrong?
20	His heart... It's a human heart!
21	[ML:undisp ]Uh?
22	He's...
23	...a Flesh Eater!
bf08090100_ms.json
1	W-what...\nWhat did you do to me?
2	Easy. You'll be fine.
3	It's not perfect. So be careful with it.
4	Mythra...
5	My name... You still remember it, do you?
6	I guess that makes sense.\nYou never did return to your crystal, did you?
7	[ML:undisp ]...
8	You're a lucky man, Jin.
9	You've been given the second chance you\ndenied to many brave Ardainians.
10	I doubt your luck would hold up so well if Mòrag\nwere here!
11	Mythra... Didn't you and Jin...?
12	Yes.\nWe fought together against Malos, once.
13	That's why I need to know...
14	Why?\nWhy did you take Malos's side?
15	You really want to know?
16	You only think you do.\nIf you knew, it'd destroy you too.
17	I can guess.
18	And I can tell you...\nIt didn't lead me to the same conclusion as you.
19	[ML:undisp ]...
20	Lora...\nShe's in there, isn't she?
21	[ML:undisp ]...
22	With everything you've done,\nwe can't forgive you.
23	And if you're going to keep standing in our way in the future,
24	keep trying to destroy the world, we will stop you.
25	But, right now...
26	Naive kid.
27	This is the Land of Morytha.\nAnd it's a place of more wickedness than you can imagine.
28	You know it?
29	This land was destroyed long before Alrest existed.
30	The birthplace of the Architect.
31	That's what Malos said.
32	The...Architect's...
33	Jin...
34	I know full well there's no easy\nway to change your mind.
35	But hear me out.
36	Let's regroup, and climb up the World Tree.
37	Call it a ceasefire until then, OK?
38	A united front?
39	As you wish...
40	...It's not like I could take you on\nin this state anyway.
bf08100100_ms.json
1	Can I have a word?
2	[ML:undisp ]...
3	I'm Brighid. But I hardly needed to introduce\nmyself to you, did I?
4	You must know practically all there is to know\nabout me by now.
5	The stuff in here... The old me, the me you knew...
6	Is this journal the truth?
7	...
8	I need to know if I can trust what I wrote in here.
bf08120100_ms.json
1	If you knew...\nYou think it would change anything?
2	Explain.
3	The Brighid I knew... Well, you aren't her.
4	It's like talking to a whole new Blade.
5	Makes sense.\nThere's no going back to who I was.
6	But, I still need to know.
7	I want to know what I did, what I really thought...
8	And... It seems wrong to just forget about the people\nwho were important to me before...
9	I need to remember them.
10	[ML:undisp ]!
11	Jin! Please tell!
12	Really, Poppi is only just born.\nDoesn't know much!
13	But, even Poppi knows, stories of\nold Drivers very important!
14	Very precious indeed!
15	Memories of Masterpon very important.
16	Poppi always thinks, "must make many\nmore Masterpon memories"!
bf08130100_ms.json
1	So, I'm officially a Tornan Driver now.
2	OK... Let's make some memories!
bf08140100_ms.json
1	...
bf08140120_ms.json
1	Very quiet...
2	It is.
3	Poppi think...this world achieved very big\ntechnological advancement.
4	Many buildings. Many people.
5	Everybody...probably very happy here.
6	But...
7	It doesn't matter how many fancy tricks they learn.\nDeep down, they're all the same.
8	They thought they were making their lives better with all\nthis stuff. But in the end, it destroyed them.
9	Now it's just a ruin.
10	Poppi was made by technological advancement too!
11	Will Poppi...
12	...destroy the world as well?
13	That's my problem, too.
14	If this world is Father's world...
15	...then Father made me to be as dangerous as any\ntechnology.
16	Poppi and Mythra are the same?
17	Yes. Kinda.
18	But if...\nIf Poppi destroys the world...
19	...Masterpon might get destroyed too...
20	Maybe Mythra should destroy Poppi?
21	Poppi...
22	Tora created you. You could never do something\nlike that. I know it!
23	But...!
24	[ML:undisp ](adlib exertion)
25	Hey. Let's make a promise.
26	A promise...?
27	Yes. That's right, Poppi.
28	I promise that, if you ever look like you're\nabout to destroy the world...
29	I will do what you asked of me.
30	But...in return...\nCan you promise me something?
31	What would you like from Poppi?
32	Mythra is scared of destroying the world too?
33	Well, I'm doing to my best to stop it coming to that.\nIt's something else...
34	It's...
35	Hmmm?
36	No, actually, nothing.
37	I don't have a request right now.
38	Can I think it over?
39	Of course!
40	Then let's promise!
41	What's this?
42	Masterpon taught it to Poppi!\nHe said it Nopon promise ritual!
43	Lift hand up in air, then..."boop" together!
44	I see...
bf08140150_ms.json
1	So many many...
2	Mythra?!
3	There's no way around...
4	Yeah...
5	Ack!
6	No time to play around.
7	No arguments there...
8	No option but to wipe them out.\nLet's do it!
bf08150100_ms.json
1	I didn't know there were monsters like that...
2	Nothing like Alrest, for sure.
3	They've got a rotten knack of healing themselves...
4	Almost like...Blades...
5	I dunno, but...maybe they're leftovers from\nthe culture that created us.
6	This is the Architect's world.\nI guess nothing should come as a surprise.
7	I wonder what kind of a person he is...
8	I didn't get to meet him.
9	I mean, I have fragments of memories, blurred images...
10	That's why I want to meet him.
11	To create this awesome civilization...
12	I can't imagine.
13	Awesome? This?
14	Huh?
15	It's a heap of smashed-up crap.\nLook at it.
16	It was melted by a warhead or something.
17	All that's buried here is the hubris of mankind.
18	If the Architect was born here,\nthen he must be as flawed as any other.
19	No different from you people of Alrest...
20	Why do you hate us so much?
21	What is it that you think we've done?
22	Jin!
23	That...That's...
24	Torna...
bf08150150_ms.json
1	Gah!
2	Mikhail!\nThis is bad!
3	Akhos! How deep are we?
4	28,000 peds!
5	We're nearly at the limit already!
6	It's too much!\nAny more and we're...
7	We're nearly out of the Cloud Sea!\nJust hold out a bit longer!
8	Yeah, but-
9	What about Jin?
10	Are we just going to abandon him?
11	Well, I mean...
12	Just a little...\nJust a little bit more...
13	We're out!
14	This is the Land of Morytha...
15	First time I've seen it...
16	Yeah.\nWouldya look at that.
17	It's nothing to shout about.
18	Just a bunch of ruins.
19	Malos?
20	A testament to their hubris.
21	Their hubris?
22	So...humans lived here...?
23	Alrest will suffer the same fate.
24	So that's why Jin...
25	Is it really justified?
26	What are you sayin'?
27	I know why Jin wants to destroy everything... But...
28	"everything" can't mean EVERYTHING, can it?
29	You're not there yet. That's OK.
30	You'll understand soon enough.
31	Let's cross that bridge when we come to it, huh?
32	Hmmm...
bf08160100_ms.json
1	It's scorched, here and there.
2	Traces of the Aegises' battle, I reckon...
3	Must have been some battle...
4	...
5	What's...
6	The Tornan Titan's matrix.
7	Even in old Torna, few people knew this place existed.
8	I can scarcely believe it myself.
9	Matrix...\nLike a womb?
10	[ML:undisp ]!
11	These are...!
12	Blades?
13	But...they look quite a lot like Titan too...
14	These are Blades that perished in\nthe process of becoming Titans.
15	Titans grow Core Crystals within their bodies.
16	I believe you've seen this once before.
bf08180100_ms.json
1	Blades... They aren't truly immortal.
2	They are born from Titans...
3	And when their fire burns out...\nthey return to the Titan that bore them.
4	Eventually, the Blades that return, transform\ninto Titans themselves.
5	Can that be true?
6	We'll end up like that, eventually?
7	Mythra?
8	Yes. It's true.
9	The new Titan has no memory of its life as a Blade.
10	Just like returning to a core.
11	These poor souls...
12	They died along with their mother.\nShared her fate.
bf08190100_ms.json
1	So Blades are born from crystals,\nand Titans from Blades...
2	The Titan, in turn, nurtures life...
3	And someday births new Core Crystals.
4	Right. That's the life cycle of a Blade...
5	It is the way that the Architect ordained for the world.
6	Old Torna worshiped this cycle.
7	In old Torna...
8	...we revered the Titans. Feared them.
9	It was the sacred foundation of Torna. A nation where\nhumans and Blades lived in harmony.
bf08210100_ms.json
1	But, humans couldn't live like that.
2	The battle with Malos marked the end.
3	It wasn't long after you and Addam left Torna.
4	He did it... That worm, Amalthus.
5	The Praetor?
6	What did he do?
7	The one who really destroyed this place?\nIt wasn't the Aegis...
8	It was him.
9	Huh?!
bf08220100_ms.json
1	Lora!
2	Find them!\nThey must be somewhere nearby!
3	Lora...
4	Don't worry...
5	If I die, you'll just go to sleep...
6	...Someone will find you...\n...reawaken you...someday...
7	For us humans...\nBeing forgotten is a much worse fate than death.
8	We struggle...so hard to make our\nmark...on the world...
9	Lora!
10	...When you awaken...\n...To you, it'll be like I never even existed.
11	Jin...
12	the thought of you forgetting me...
13	It's like one heart is being ripped in two.
14	I won't forget you!\nI refuse to forget you!
15	How could...I ever...
16	I thought I was ready for this...
17	But now the time has come, I'm hopeless...
18	I'm so sorry to do this to you...
19	There is one way... One final chance...
20	A way that we can be together...
21	Ugh... Hroarrrggggghhh!
bf08230100_ms.json
1	I...
2	I ate her.
3	[ML:undisp ]Adlib shock/surprise
4	Maybe we shouldn't have left. I never knew...
5	Amalthus was afraid of the Aegises' power.
6	After Malos was defeated, he tried to wipe them out...\nThe remnants of Torna were annihilated in the attempt.
7	But...you'd already vanished by then.
8	So we were slaughtered...for nothing.
9	...
10	No...even if he wasn't trying to get you, Amalthus, the humans...
11	...would've done what they always do.
12	We're the Architect's children... We turn into Titans.\nThe ground beneath their feet! But they feared us.
13	So that's the reason he attacked you.
14	To save the world?\nNo.
15	His real desire for Elysium...
16	...is his desire for the Architect's power.
17	Amalthus wants to use it to wipe out Blades and Titans.
18	So that's why he was taking\ncare of Rex and the Aegis...
19	Even so!
20	Even if that's true.
21	You lot and Amalthus...you're the same!
bf08250100_ms.json
1	...
2	Didn't you say you wanted to destroy the world?\nTake out the Architect himself?
3	I did say that.
4	You know, I'm not so sure.
5	What...?
6	I don't buy it. I can't believe that's what\nyou're really trying to do here.
7	Why do you say that?\nHaven't we...
8	I could tell when we were fighting.
9	I saw it in your eyes. The sadness.
10	It was the look of someone who just wanted to die.\nSomeone with no other way out.
11	[ML:undisp ](gasp)
12	You know...\nIt was the way Pyra looked the first time we met.
13	You don't know what you're talking about.\nKeep your stupid comments to yourself.
14	You better believe we'll do it.
15	We will destroy the one responsible for this world.
16	And we will destroy all the humans who\nlived by his mercy.
17	We are sick of being used as tools by humans.
18	Well, then, there's only one thing to do.
19	As I thought.
20	What's that?
21	They're not really alive. Just autonomous cybernetic\norganisms.
22	Once their central control is gone, they're\nprogrammed to act on their own.
23	To destroy.
24	These guys?
25	Testaments to human hubris.\nNow do you see?
bf08260100_ms.json
1	Guaah!
2	Jin!\nPyra! Use the Artifice!
3	It's no use!\nThe Cloud Sea is interfering. I can't give it commands.
4	Damn!\nSo it's all down to us, huh?
5	Pyra!\nMove in close if you can get a shot!
6	Then get Mythra to use Foresight, quick as you can!
7	Understood! Ready to go!
8	OK! Let's do it!
9	Lightning?\nCould it be...?
10	Look, Rex-Rex!
11	Rex! Pyra! You OK?
12	Jin?! What the hell?
13	That can wait!\nFirst deal with that!
14	OK!
bf08270100_ms.json
1	Th-this is...
2	Rex-Rex? What's matter?\nFind something?
3	Uh! N-no...it's nothing.
4	We talk about what to do next.\nRex-Rex should join!
5	Ah...yeah...OK!
6	It can't be...
bf08280100_ms.json
1	Climb up the World Tree to the top?\nVery very tiring...
2	It's doesn't look that far from here to\nthe surface at least.
3	We can manage that, surely?
4	Don't you ever quit with that optimism, hmmm?
5	Hehehe...
6	Rex.
7	I can see why you've brought Jin, but I advise\nyou not to let your guard down.
8	Mòrag!
9	Got a point.
10	...
11	I don't need your remorse now, Jin.
12	But when we're past this crisis, I'm taking you in.
13	I owe it to my leader and to my people.
14	If you resist, we'll kill you.
15	Brighid and I.
16	Yes.
17	Mòrag!
18	What? Another monster?\nWhat is it this time?
19	Masterpon! Above!
20	It's the Monoceros!\nAre they here for Jin?

1	That's Jin.\nWhat's he doing with them?
2	Weird.\nLet's ask questions later, huh?
3	After we've finally smashed 'em up.
4	Huh? Seriously?
5	W-Well, OK!

23	Huh?
24	You can't be too predictable.
25	Right, Mik?
26	Sounds like a plan.\nNever seen that side of Jin before.
27	Let's bring him up!\nThen it's World Tree climbing time!
28	Yes sir!

32	You're still...
33	like you used to be...
34	Jin...
35	Damn!\nArseholes!
36	That's a bit unsporting of them, using a giant boat.
37	We must hurry!\nThe longer we wait, the bigger their advantage!
38	Yeah! We gotta go, Rex!
39	Gramps. You knew, right?\nAbout Jin?
40	Indeed.
41	Why didn't you tell me?
42	He is not like Malos.
43	To be honest, I didn't know if you could handle it.
44	You care too much at times.
45	...
46	Jin and Malos must be defeated.
47	Who knows how that'll turn out.
48	But facing them is Pyra and Mythra's unavoidable fate.
49	So I kept quiet.
50	Pyra and Mythra's fate...
51	She shoulders the burden of sustaining your life.
52	Rex... What burden are you taking for her?
53	Can you live for something, and hold true to it?
54	Yeah. Of course!
55	I'm living for them.\nPyra and Mythra!
56	I see.
57	Well, I guess you're OK then.
58	Just be sure to walk your own path, Rex.

62	Sorry! Wait up!

1	Your Majesty!\nYesterday, we sealed Section 47.
2	I see.\nThis is even faster than the surveys estimated.
3	Furthermore, we've detected surges of geothermal\nenergy in the royal precincts.
4	So we can't hold out for long. Even here.
5	The ether flow is the lifeblood of the Titan. The\ntemperature is increasing with its age.
6	Perhaps we should hasten moving\nthe capital to Gormott.
7	We've only just recalled the consul.
8	And with no good explanation to the Gormotti.
9	We don't want to sow discord for no benefit.
10	It's just, I fear time is running short...
11	Indeed, but not only for us.
12	Gormott is fertile for now...
13	But the harvests have been declining for years.
14	It's like a cry issuing up from the center of the world.

16	Your Majesty? What is it?
17	Nothing...\nJust my imagination.
18	My sister...\nWhere are you now?
bf08310100_ms.json
1	[ML:undisp ]*gasp*
2	The Great Void... It's almost completely gone...
3	After all, the Great Void was Ophion's doing.
4	Yes, indeed.
5	So with Ophion gone, the Great Void\ncould not support itself...
6	If only we were above the surface,\nwe could easily cross.
7	I mean, it doesn't look impossible to climb...
8	But it's nastier than any mountain, that's for sure.
9	Everyone! Here!
10	Pyra?
11	The insides of the World Tree... I'd never have\nthought...
12	It seems to be an artificial tower\nenveloped by gargantuan plant life.
13	It seems like we can use this to travel up.
14	Up? Pyra...\nWhat did you do?
15	Honestly, I'm not sure myself.
16	It's like my body is remembering something all by itself.
17	It must be...another power granted to\nthe Master Blade by Father...
18	So...we need to hurry.
19	Why?
20	This was hardwired into my brain.\nSo, Malos must have the same thing.
21	Not good.
22	Seems this is some kind of elevator.
23	That's some fancy glazing...
24	Ooh, you never were good with heights.\nShut your eyes!
25	Let's go.
bf08320100_ms.json
1	You can die when we're done.
2	We made it this far. I don't plan on giving up.
3	Damn. If Judicium hadn't have gone down...
4	...we might have got you some better treatment.
5	Uh-uh.
6	When human cells are woven into the body of a Blade...
7	...they awaken strange abilities.
8	That's good enough for me.
9	This'll do fine.
10	Even though she'd hate you for it... Right?
11	I know Lora wouldn't have wanted this.
12	Even so, I've got to keep my promise.
13	All right. I'm with you...all the way.
14	[ML:undisp ]...
15	Hey, Jin.\nYou better not get sentimental.
16	I found the ruins of\nTorna down in Morytha...
17	Oh?
18	There were half-rotted Blades there.\nCouldn't grow into Titans.
19	They must've lived on for a while down there.
20	A man once said, 'Live together with the humans.'
21	Really, we were just living for the humans.
22	That was what the Architect ordained for us.
23	And look what we became.
bf08340100_ms.json
1	You're still sure about what you want, right?
2	That thing...
3	It's a reminder.
4	To remind me what a fool I was\nto ever have faith in the Architect.
bf08350100_ms.json
1	*sigh* Rex-Rex look worried...
2	Maybe Rex-Rex lost wallet?
3	It's not that.
4	Oh! I see!\nWell, maybe your worry is your wallet's empty.
5	Well that's true.\nI don't work much these days...
6	Hey... Why are you so interested in my\nfinances all of a sudden?
7	What is up with you, kid?\nYou've been a right gloomyguts lately.
8	Mmm...\nI was thinking about Amalthus.
9	If what Jin said is true, the Praetor\ndoesn't just hate Blades...
10	...but humans too.
11	I mean, he basically hates\nthe whole world, seems like.
12	How so?
13	In old Torna, humans lived together with Blades\nthat eventually became Titans.
14	So destroying Torna was the same as destroying the Titans.
15	Amalthus must have known that the Titans\nhave been dying off over the last few centuries.
16	Cannot live without Titans!\nEverybody go bye-bye!
17	Maybe the Praetorium saw it as an obstacle\nto their power.
18	If the Blades were becoming Titans and creating new\nland, people might have more faith in the Blades.
19	If a new faith emerged, it would threaten\nthe Praetorium and its dogma.
20	I understand that much.\nThat's just war and politics.
21	But...
22	Rex...
23	Hating people, hating yourself...\nwhere does it end?
24	What do you do when you hate the whole world?
25	You mean...
26	Destroy it. That's all that's left.
27	Tell me I'm wrong.
28	That's a leap of logic... But I think a lot\nof mortals are like that.
29	D'you remember?
30	Talking to the Praetor...\nI said it felt like talking to Malos.
31	Yeah. You did say that.
32	It's a funny thing.\nMalos and the Praetor, they want the same thing.

4	It's...
5	It's Indol!

7	They...took us by surprise!
8	Patroka! Prepare the defenses!\nI'll analyze the threat!
9	I'm on it!\nYou need to counterattack, damn it!
10	Stop trying to give orders and get to it!
11	Ugh...!
12	Aghh! Where's Mikhail?\nWhat a time to let us down!
13	Mikhail's down below.
14	Below? But...
15	Got it! A bypass to the cannons!
16	Watch this, scum!
17	Ready?
18	Ready.
19	The ship'll get you as far as the boundary layer.
20	We can drop you and Malos off there.
21	We'll have to. Alrest ships can't make it past the\nboundary layer.
22	Yeah, no sweat.
23	Jin.\nYou are OK with this, right?
24	...
25	Mikhail...
26	Mm?
27	Take care of Lora.
28	Jin?!
29	Akhos.\nFire up the Blade Bots.
30	Time to strike.
31	Jin! Malos!
32	Indol...\nThey got here sooner than we thought.
33	They gave up on the boy pretty quick.\nNo surprise...
34	Hatch open.\nReady to launch!
35	OK! Launch!
36	Marsanes, Tornan Warship
bf08390100_ms.json
1	Well, no way I'd ever have guessed the\nWorld Tree was like this on the inside.
2	It definitely appears to be man-made.
3	Created by the same civilization as Morytha...
4	The birthplace of the Architect...\nThat's what Jin called it.
5	Then maybe the Architect built this thing...
6	Do you really think we're going to find him at the top?\nAnd Elysium too?
7	From what we saw in Morytha, it seemed like all that stuff\nhappened a gazillion years ago.
8	Or maybe two gazillion, I don't know.
9	Not even Titans live that long.
10	Even Pyra and Mythra have never actually met him.\nBut this tower's right here. It's real...
11	So...
12	'Seeing is believing', is the phrase, hm?
13	We'll just have to find out for ourselves.\nThere's no use speculating.
14	Nia, what's wrong?\nIs tummy started rumbling?
15	Oh, for the...
16	Every time with you it's 'have you lost\nyour wallet?' or 'are you hungry?'
17	Is that really all you can think of?
18	Mehhhh...
19	Wh-wh... T-Tora thought food is only thing that\nmakes Nia all...um...growly-growly.
20	Watch it, furball...
21	What is Nia's problem?
22	That's not a nice way to ask, Poppi.\nBut I'll let it slide.
23	There's something I want to ask you Blades.
24	Tell the truth...\nHave you ever wanted to extend your life?
25	Avoid returning to our cores?
26	Yeah.
27	That's a tough question...
28	I would like to keep learning about my former selves...\nBut to keep living after Mòrag is dead...
29	Oh, I'm sorry...
30	No, I understand.
31	*sigh* The idea of living on without her\ndoes not appeal to me.
32	Yeah, same here.
33	I want my memories of the Prince to be just between us.
34	You're going to make me blush, Pandy!
35	Dromarch?
36	As long as I'm by my lady's side till the end...\n...then I'm satisfied.
37	Poppi is artificial Blade.\nSo it is very sad for me to think about.
38	When Masterpon is gone, Poppi\nwill be widow.
39	Mehhhhh!
40	Well, not quite. But I get where you're coming from.
41	Pyra?
42	Well, I...
43	It's different for you, right?\nYou've been alive for a few centuries...
44	Did I ask you?\nPyra, what do you think about it, really?
45	Hey...
46	Sometimes I wondered why I have to\nkeep on living forever...
47	...Just on and on. No end in sight.
48	But...
49	...it's different now.
50	I'm glad I've stayed alive all this time.
51	Parting is always sad, but it's just part of the deal of\nbeing me.
52	Though...maybe...
53	...Maybe one day I'd be happy to close my eyes\nforever...with someone special there by my side.
54	Pyra...
55	That's our Pyra.
56	Thanks, guys.\nThanks for sharing with me.
57	So...what made you ask?
58	I'm a Flesh Eater.
59	So... I don't know how long I'll live for.
60	I mean, for all I know, I might just snuff it tomorrow.
61	My lady...
62	But I can say this much.\nMy life and death isn't tied to any human.
63	And?
64	It's Jin.
65	I've been wondering.
66	Jin was collecting Core Crystals.
67	But why didn't he use them?\nDoesn't he hate humans?
68	He could use them to create Blades,\nthen turn them into Flesh Eaters.
69	He could expand Torna with\nno need for humans in the mix.
70	They do lack numbers. Is that all of them?
71	Yeah. It's just the five of 'em. That's it.
72	When Malos suggested getting Obrona and\nAkhos to resonate, Jin was dead against it.
73	So I think maybe...\nMaybe Jin feels the same way as us...
74	The same way as us...?
75	I think maybe that's why he won't\nresonate with anyone.
bf08400100_ms.json
1	An explosion?
2	A battle, perhaps?
3	So, this is what the World Tree's really like...
4	These... They aren't leaves...\nThey're glyphs?
5	Hey, look!
6	An old Tornan warship...\nDidn't think there'd be any of those left...
7	Never mind that! What's this?
8	I had no idea Indol could make it up this high.
9	Cloud Sea loooooooong way down!
10	It appears that Indol has modified their Titan\nas old Temperantia did with theirs.
11	But, that much firepower...
12	I did not know Indol possessed so much force.
13	No need to ask what they plan to do with it.
14	They anticipated it.\nThat Jin and Malos would try to ascend.
15	So...Jin is inside that thing?
16	Yes. No doubt.
17	Let's hurry!\nWe can't let them make it to Elysium!
18	How do we get up there though?\nThe anchor's not going to reach.
19	We just need to get a bit closer...
bf08430100_ms.json
1	You know you can't control it.
2	I hear you've been promoted...by the Praetor.
3	You... Why?
4	Hmph.\nJust thought I'd come and say goodbye.
5	Would you rather I leave without saying anything?
6	"Goodbye"?!\nWhat would compel you to leave me?
7	You are my...
8	I've got full control of all my powers now.
9	It doesn't matter if you die.\nI can keep on going.
10	What are you saying, Malos?
11	The Praetorium, the believers...I despise them all.\nHumans aren't fit to breathe our air.
12	So...I'm going to give you what you always wanted.
13	But I never...
14	I'm clearing out the worthless.
15	Isn't that why you sought the Architect?\nWhy you climbed the World Tree?
16	Yet look at you now.
17	...
18	There must be someone out there\nwho can use this core...
19	I'll send them after Malos...
bf08450100_ms.json
1	Indoline warrior monks?!
2	To the Aegis and her Driver.\nWe're here to pass on an order from His Eminence.
3	You are to use the Aegis's power to\nbring down that ship!
4	[ML:undisp ]Huh?
5	What's wrong?\nThis is your duty, pilgrim!
6	My only duty is to open the way\nto the World Tree!
7	You cannot do it?
8	If so...then we must take the Aegis into custody.
9	I get it now.
10	They just wanted to use Mythra's power\nto burn up their little problem...
11	Nothing new under the sun...
12	I didn't say we couldn't do it.\nBut we have to stop Jin.
13	Tell your boss that's what we're doing.\nOK?
14	We don't negotiate holy decrees.
15	If you don't comply, then prepare for\nrighteous chastisement!

15	Fan la Norne's...?
16	Oh, that's it all right! The other half...!
17	What is it? Nia!
18	A-Amalthus... He took Fan la Norne's Core Crystal...
19	He's using...her power!
20	Gah...!
21	Not only that. This is in fact my original, primal power.

4	Heh. No.
5	But who?
6	Amalthus.
7	Amalthus?
8	He's my Driver...and I'm an Aegis.
9	If that energy gets any stronger, he won't just\ncontrol the Blades, but Mythra too.
10	...
11	Amalthus, you never disappoint!
bf08480100_ms.json
1	I am the Driver of the Master Blade.
2	Bow before me...
3	the Master Driver.
4	I possess the power to command all Blades.
5	Every Blade alive...
6	Indeed...
7	even the very Titans are under my control.
8	...That must be how he repelled the attack...\nSooner or later, he'll control us too.
9	Don't worry.
10	Half-breeds like you won't come under his control.
11	Sure, he can dampen your power.
12	But that's why we built those things.
13	Mikhail's creations will not submit to Amalthus's control.
14	And neither will this bucket of bolts!

5	You're speaking nonsense, boy.
6	Now is the hour of their doom.
7	You leave me no choice but to perform your duty for you.
8	Destroying Jin and Torna?\nWe're only trying to stop them!
9	Not kill them!
10	You believe you can sway them with words of reason?
11	Well, yes!
12	Jin told me what happened.\nWhat happened 500 years ago.
13	And you were the cause of it, weren't you, Praetor?
14	I was nothing but the mouthpiece of the Architect.
15	When I meet him, I'll ask him myself!
16	About me, about Pyra and Mythra!
17	That is not your right!\nIt is mine!
18	Ah!
19	Hngh! You resist?
20	Again? You defy me again?

23	Th-that's right!\nRex! You're the Aegis's Driver!
24	There's nothing he can do that you can't!

13	That's easy to say, but what can we do\nabout it when they're all the way out there?
14	...Got it! The glowing pillars!
15	Just then, when one of the pillars got wrecked,\nAmalthus's power got weaker for a moment!
16	So if we smash the pillars, he'll\nlose control over the Titans...?
17	It's worth a shot!\nOK. Mythra?
18	And we only want to hit the pillars?
19	Yeah.
20	It's moving far too much,\nI can't get a clear shot...
21	This isn't going to work.
22	Oh man...
23	(I know - Mythra!)
24	What?
25	If we can get a little closer, we might\nbe able to do something.
26	Is that true, Pyra?
27	Probably!\nThink back, do you remember our fight against Jin?
28	By rewriting the physical laws of the surroundings...
29	we were able to match Jin's speed.
30	If we rewrote them in the same way,\nin the midst of battle between those two...
31	From our point of view, it'll be like\nthey've frozen in place, huh...? OK...
32	But how do we get there?
33	Ha! Tora have good suggestion!
34	Poppi!
35	Think you could grab Mythra and\nRex-Rex and carry up there?
36	Yes! Poppi can carry two people no problem!
37	Ta-daa!
38	OK, let's do it!\nEveryone else after Jin!
39	Hang on!
40	We don't have time to argue here.
41	Don't worry.\nWe're going to make this work. Right?

47	When I look at you guys,\nit reminds me of them.
48	I wonder...

50	I wonder that, and I start doubting myself.
51	Mikhail...
52	It's Rex, right?
53	Yeah...
54	Have you found your answer?
55	I have, and it's pretty spectacular.

5	Can't say I have.\nNever seen the need for it, myself.
6	Oh...?
7	Why does anyone kill others?
8	Because they're in your way, or\nbecause you can't bear the sight of 'em.
9	You kill because you're weak.
10	But I'm not weak.\nSo I don't need to kill anyone.
11	And I don't mean physically, yeah?
12	I mean in here.
13	I suppose...that makes me weak, then.

4	Uh, what?
5	Just give me a straight answer.

7	Sure, there's plenty of room for improvement...
8	But then, there's also plenty of stuff that's awesome.
9	What about us?
10	Huh?
11	Ah! I think Shellhead's about to propose.

19	I will sleep, as at the end of any other day.
20	When I awake, will I be the same person as before?
21	If the Architect does indeed exist, I wish I could ask him...
22	Who am I, truly?
23	Whence did I come, whither am I headed?
24	If I were a praying man,\nI'd pray this journal finds its way to you.

6	For us?\nAre you trying to stop us going after Malos?
7	Perhaps...
8	[ML:undisp ]?
9	I want to see for myself.
10	If this world has any will of its own...
11	which one would it choose, you or Malos...?
12	Then...you should let us pass.
13	That, I cannot do.
14	But why? In your state, you\nshould barely be able to stand!
15	You know if we fight now, you'll...!
16	You see right through me, Mythra.

2	But so do we!
3	[ML:undisp ]Hmph!
4	Oh no you don't!
5	The power to manifest what you imagine...
6	Truly awesome...
7	That power comes from the Architect.\nWhy do you wield it for mortals' sake?
8	To get to Elysium!
9	And then what?
10	Open it up to humans?
11	Share it out between them?
12	Do you even need to ask?! Obviously!
13	And then what?
14	Can't you see where that leads?
15	What are you saying?!
16	Humans will make Elysium into another Morytha...
17	Just as they did with Torna, 500 years ago.
18	I won't let that happen!
19	And after you die? What then?
20	Who will stop the inevitable?!
21	Isn't that...
22	Isn't that the reason that you Blades exist?!
23	[ML:undisp ]?!
24	And when I'm not around to\nstand by you in that effort...
25	Someone else will!
26	That's right.\nWhen a person dies, that's it for them.
27	But their thoughts and memories will\nalways be passed on to someone else.
28	Isn't that the same with you Blades?
29	Your past selves get passed down to\nsomeone else to become your new selves...
30	Isn't that how you've always lived?
31	We're no different!
32	From now on, I'll protect you.
33	I'll keep you safe, always...

5	It's awesome.
6	It's enough to make me envious.
7	Envious...of us?
8	So I'd like to ask the Architect.
9	Pyra, Mythra, all of you...
10	Why did he create all these incredible people?
11	Actually, I think I might already know the answer.
12	But I'd still like to check with the man himself.
13	To check your answer?
14	Yeah.
15	You...believe you know the reason we exist?

40	If the Architect did send Blades down to this world...\nit was for my sake.
41	To find and raise cores containing more\npowerful, wondrous, unparalleled data...
42	That is why I created the cleansing procedure.
43	Behold the culmination of my work!
44	You lunatic...
45	He took the cores from all those Blades...
46	So that was the reason for the cleansing...
47	I am an agent of the Architect's will!
48	What is he saying?
49	Delusions of grandeur...
50	You can't just decide stuff like that, dude!
51	You're out of your damned mind!
52	It is no delusion!\nHave you forgotten the Aegis's power?
53	That power...
54	Is it not the Aegis's power to erase\nworthless things from existence?!
55	Is that not the Architect's very will?!
56	Pyra and Mythra aren't like that!
57	...I just realized.
58	I know why Malos is so intent\non scouring the world...
59	It's you, Amalthus.
60	Malos has become tainted by your influence...
61	So what if he has?\nWhat's the problem?

2	The time has come...

1	It stop moving...
2	Perhaps we've arrived at the endpoint?
3	If we go outside, we find out.
4	Good point. Let's have a look.
5	Look up!
6	The stars... They're close enough to touch...
7	The other view is quite something, too.\nLook at the Cloud Sea all the way down there...
8	So this is the top of the World Tree...
9	Ahh...! That sound...!
10	Huh? What is that?
11	It's Elysium...
12	Elysium?!
bf10050100_ms.json
1	This way.\nLet's check it out.
bf10060100_ms.json
1	It's been a while, "Father"...
2	Logos...
3	Is that my real name?\nWhat's it mean, "Logos"?
4	It has no meaning. All it represents\nis the ego of those who named you.
5	Hah...\nHow many years has it been...?
6	I forget.\nIt has been far too long...
7	You know why I'm here, don't you?
8	I know it all. All that you experience\nis passed on to me here.
9	...Then let's get straight to the point.
10	[ML:undisp ]Hngh-?!
11	No need to rush, my child.
12	I am fading.\nI'll be gone...soon enough...
13	Is that right...?
14	Then I'll take it all.
15	Do as you wish.\nIf you believe that is your role...
16	[ML:undisp]...
17	Is that choice really "mine"?
18	[ML:undisp]...
19	Answer me.\nThis is what I came to hear.
20	...It is a choice you made together.
21	Good answer.
22	Thanks for creating me.
23	Ah, and here comes the other answer...

2	No...
3	...Can this place really be Elysium...?
4	Where's the greenery? The water? Birdsong?
5	There's nothing...\nNothing here at all!
6	What a wretched sight...
7	I have not seen anything like this\nin all my years on Alrest...
8	P-Pyra?!
9	I don't understand...
10	I don't get it!
11	This...\nThis is not how I...remember...
12	That bell sound must be coming\nfrom somewhere. Is someone here?
13	Hmm...
14	Over there...
15	Poppi detect one big thing, kind of like building,\nover that direction.
16	Sound seem like it come from there.
17	That building, eh?
18	Then there's no point hanging around here.
19	Yeah...\nOnly one way to find out.
20	Let's go, Rex.
21	All right.
22	It might still be OK. Maybe\nit's just this bit that's destroyed...
23	[ML:undisp]...
24	There's bound to be something over that way.
bf10100100_ms.json
1	This place looks like it was once a city,\nand quite an old one at that.
2	It's actually a lot like the stuff we saw in Morytha...
3	Way more dusty, though.\nMaybe because it's so dry up here.
4	[ML:undisp ]Uh?
5	It seems to have been a child's vehicle.
6	Right...
7	So that means...\nPeople lived here, once.
8	It must've been a grand old city.
9	It stretches further than the eye can see...
10	You could fit...the entire population of\nAlrest into this place, and with room to spare...

1	Is that it...?
2	The bells have stopped...
3	A signal we should enter, perhaps?

6	Who's there?!
7	Father...?
8	What? You don't mean...!
9	The Architect is here...?\nBut where?
10	I am always here.\nCome to me...

24	You're acting almost like Mythra today, Pyra...

7	You're-!
8	My name is Klaus.\nThe Architect of this world.
9	I have watched over you all this time.
10	I have seen your thoughts. Your desires.\nThe things you have achieved.
11	So you did that, just now?
12	Yes. Those were not your present\nforms, but alternate possibilities.
13	Your other selves that lie within.\nThat is what I wanted to see.
14	Our other selves?
15	You mean we're all thinking\nstuff like that deep down?
16	Was that how we really feel?

19	It creeped me out!\nWhat're you trying to prove?
20	...Those were\nthe fears you harbor...
21	I don't get it at all!
22	What was your purpose in showing us this?
23	Those were not pleasant visions to behold.
24	My only purpose...was to find out...
25	how mankind has changed...
26	and where it is headed.
27	And were you disappointed?
28	No...
29	As you stand before me right now...\nThat is who you are.
30	That is enough.
31	Architect, sir...\nI came here because I met Pyra.
32	Is this really Elysium?
33	Are you really...
34	I will show you everything.
35	Memories... Mine, and those of this planet.
bf10230100_ms.json
1	This world was once the stage...
2	of a struggle for survival that\ndwarfed this current predicament.
3	The world was an unseemly place,\nthough glimpses of beauty persisted.
4	What should people live for?
5	Who should they live for...?
6	[ML:undisp]...
7	They live for themselves.
8	To harbor desires and struggle to realize\nthem - that is the natural state of man.
9	But I did not think that was good enough.
10	I lost hope for mankind.
11	I searched tirelessly for an outside solution.
12	And one day, I found it. The Conduit.
13	Why it chose to appear before us, I do not know.
14	However, its existence presented a new possibility...
15	Possibility?
16	Our world was not the only one.
17	Endless universes coexist, side by side,
18	yet all completely unaware of one another.
19	The Conduit was our link to\nthese foreign worlds...
20	And I opened that forbidden gateway...
21	praying that it would change the world...
bf10240100_ms.json
1	You have seen the plain called\nMorytha, have you not?
2	That is what remains of my world.
3	When I opened the Conduit,\nmany people and many things...
4	disappeared, into distant dimensions.
5	All that remained here were the ruins of Morytha...
6	and half of my body.
7	[ML:undisp ]!
8	Your...body...
9	Half of me lives on in some other dimension.
10	But...not for much longer.
11	What do you mean?
12	The moment of my other self's\ndemise draws near.
13	Father, you...
14	I was a fool.
15	Because of my foolishness, I lost everything.
16	Left here, alone and broken, I longed for oblivion...\nBut even that eluded me.
17	This is my punishment...
18	Retribution from on high, for the sin I have committed...
19	On high...?
20	There was only one thing I could do...
21	I had to atone for my sin.
22	I swore to restore this world.
23	The first thing I created...
24	was a special particulate substance with\nthe ability to restore deteriorated matter.
25	You all know it as the Cloud Sea.
26	The Cloud Sea can disassemble\nmatter it comes in contact with,
27	and rebuild it in the image of all the things\nthat once made up this world.
28	This way, little by little I could rebuild\nthe world I had brought to ruin...
29	Next, I began to recreate life.
30	I gathered miniature vessels containing memories\nof all this planet's former lifeforms,
31	and I scattered them across the Cloud Sea.\nThese are the Core Crystals.
32	The Crystals bonded with the Cloud Sea's\nparticulate reconstructors...
33	and formed the nuclei of new life.
34	Those nuclei developed into minute lifeforms-
35	the Titans-who would over time grow larger and larger.
36	Finally, the Titans gave birth
37	to complex organisms, based on the\ndata in their Core Crystals.
38	This newly-birthed life, over untold millennia...
39	evolved into a new breed of mankind.
40	So that's how we came to live in this world...
41	But I did not trust this world,\nborn as it had been.
42	What if it were to repeat our mistakes?
43	What if someone like me appeared?
44	To stave off these doubts,\nI implemented one final measure.
45	And so the Blades were born.
46	[ML:undisp ]Ah!
47	Ontos, Logos and Pneuma...
48	the three cores of the Trinity Processor formed their cornerstone.
49	However... Ontos triggered a space-time\ntransition event, and disappeared forever.
50	I was left with the other two, Logos and Pneuma,\nentrusting them with managing the Blades.
51	Malos and Pyra...
52	Those are the names that you now know them under.
53	So, I am... Pneuma...
54	'Managing'?
55	The Core Crystals at the heart of each Blade
56	are tasked with relaying all kinds of\ninformation to Logos and Pneuma...
57	About the selection pressures of the outside world,\nand the biological status of their bonded human,
58	but also the experiences and emotions they share.
59	As the data continually accrues...
60	new evolutionary code is sent back\nto the Core Crystals,
61	and this code is used to create\nnew, further evolved Blades.
62	These Blades too become Titans, in time,
63	and create new generations of lifeforms...
64	This was the new circle of life I had created.
65	A grand scheme...
66	It boggles the mind a tad.
67	So we were all born from\nthis endless cycle of life...
68	To replace the victims of the previous world.
69	That's right.
70	But there were also a handful of survivors.
71	I believe you saw them when you were in Morytha.
72	The unfortunate ones who clung to life...
73	[ML:undisp ]Ahh...!
74	You mean those monsters...\nWere they...originally people?
75	Core Crystals were first conceived as\na replacement for human brain cells.
76	
77	A product of mankind's age-old quest for immortality.
78	And that's what became of them...? How awful.
79	But that technology became the starting point\nfor the creation of Blades and Titans.
80	So in one sense, their sacrifice was not in vain...
81	Though not all may see it as such.
82	So, tell us. In the end...
83	Did we develop as you had hoped?
84	What do you think?
85	I...couldn't possibly...
86	Well...\nThose phantasms which you all experienced earlier...
87	Those are feelings that lurk in all of your hearts.
88	...As well as that man, Amalthus's...

11	Then why would you-
12	It is fate.
13	Fate?
14	It is fated to happen.\nIt cannot but happen.
15	My atonement was doomed from the start.
16	That can't be-
17	I had made my peace with it. Once more,\nI longed for nothing more than to disappear.
18	However...
19	Something has now changed.
20	And that is you, Rex. You and Pneuma.
21	Me and...Pyra and Mythra...?
22	You reforged your bond in a way I had not\nthought possible. And the life you share...
bf10260100_ms.json
1	Moreover...
2	The Conduit, which fell into a stubborn silence after\nthe world's end, has begun stirring once more.

4	The power you and Pneuma exercise\nis the Conduit's power.
5	It comes leaking out of some far-flung dimension.
6	And it is a power we can know nothing about.

6	neither good nor evil.
7	He is driven by a certain impulse...
8	The despair that the man named Amalthus felt.
9	I see...
10	So it was right. What I felt back then, I mean.
11	Rex...
12	Rex... What is it you desire?
13	What else?
14	To stop Malos.
15	And if you succeed?
16	I'll punch him in his stupid face. And then...
17	Probably get a drink with him or something.
18	That's the sixth rule of the Salvager's Code.
19	First have a punch-out, then drink to forget.\nOnce you've forgotten, the friendship's all set!
20	I'm not old enough to drink yet though...

bf10340100_ms.json
1	Malos!
2	Just in time for the final act, boy!\nI've saved you the best seats in the house.
3	[ML:undisp]...
4	Hah, I sounded just like Akhos for a moment there.
5	Akhos is dead, you bastard.
6	So is Patroka, and Jin...
7	Figured as much.
8	...Is that all?
9	What, you want me to weep and deliver a eulogy?\nWhat good would that do?
10	They all desired oblivion,\nand now they've achieved it.
11	Least I can do is send them off with a smile.
12	Malos... Is this really what you want?
13	Huh?
14	Is this what YOU want, Malos?!
15	I don't understand the question.
16	You must understand by now?
17	That none of this is your own will!
18	Heh.
19	You have to see all of this came from Amalthus!
20	Even if that's true, so what?
21	And don't give me some weak-ass crap\nabout how I should repent or whatever.
22	Why don't you want to hear the truth?
23	Here's the thing.
24	I don't give a rat's ass what you think, brat!
25	[ML:undisp ]!!
26	So Blades become Titans?\nAnd Titans give life to humans...?
27	Honestly, who even gives a damn?
28	They can become whatever they want.
29	But that man...\nHe'd lost everything.
bf10360100_ms.json
1	He no longer wanted anything.
2	He didn't even want to live any more.
3	And despite that...
4	His life was the one thing he hadn't lost.
5	Because he couldn't.
6	Jin...
7	the thought of you forgetting me...
8	It's like one heart is being ripped in two.
bf10380100_ms.json
1	Words can be a curse.
2	That curse was what kept him tied down here.
3	A wretched tale, isn't it?
4	This whole world is a wretched place!
5	Do not forget that you too are a part of that world.
6	If it were not for you, for Amalthus...
7	Both Jin and Lora's lives may\nhave taken quite different paths.
8	Exactly! That's exactly it!
9	You've gotten smarter with age, huh?
10	I'm a wretched being too!\nA hideous monster, far beyond saving!
11	...So let's end this now.
12	Don't you feel anything?
13	Father's sadness? The world he longed for?!
14	How could I?
15	That isn't...
16	my role in this world.
17	This man... Does he mean to...?!
18	Come at me, kid!\nCome, my partner!
19	Give me all you've got...
20	You better show me all of it!
21	The extent of your will!
22	Show me why you're here in this world!
bf10390100_ms.json
1	[ML:undisp ]Urghh!
2	You're not burning anyone today!
3	My lady!
4	Dromarch!
5	Don't trouble yourself, it's nothing!
6	Haaahhh!
7	Can you still not see?!
8	[ML:undisp ]Gh-!
9	Stop the Artifice!
10	Malos!
11	See what, brat?!
12	The world's never gonna change if that's all you got!
bf10390130_ms.json
1	It will change!
2	I will change it!
3	That's the reason we've come all this way!
4	Why don't you just let it go?!
5	Who do you think you're doing this for?!
6	I'm doing it...for myself.
7	If it helps put smiles on people's faces...
8	Helps them live their lives together...
9	Then that's my role in this world!
10	Jin told me to take care of\nyou in his place, you know.
11	Jin never wanted to die...
12	He just wanted to connect with you!
13	He did it because you showed him a path!
14	And how many people died because of it?!
15	You'd forgive him, just like that?!
16	Forgiving isn't that easy.
17	But that's just the world we live in!
18	We need to find a way forward, within that world!
19	[ML:undisp]...
20	Even you...
21	used to think like that once!
bf10390150_ms.json
1	Today, we use our power to fell a god,\nand then seize our destiny!
2	Hurry...
3	The time...is nigh...
bf10400100_ms.json

8	But even so...
9	If...
10	If I had been your Driver...
11	All of this...
12	Hah...\nKids say the damnedest things...
13	There was only one Driver for me.
14	All in all...
15	It wasn't...so bad...
16	Malos...
17	Looks like he's finally found it.
18	Lady Mòrag...?
19	A meaning to his life...
20	Indeed...
21	Frankly, I'm a little jealous.
22	After all, most people...
23	go their whole lives\nwithout finding theirs...
24	[ML:undisp]...
25	I wonder if I'll find mine...
26	You've got one already, haven't you?
27	And if what you've got isn't enough for you, well...
28	you can always leave things to the next generation.

45	Since the Conduit disappeared,
46	the power holding Elysium together was cut off!
47	What's gonna happen when it crumbles?!\nNot-?!
48	Everything above this point will either orbit the\nplanet or be flung into space by centrifugal force.
49	However...
50	Everything below this point - the World Tree\nitself - will fall apart on top of Alrest!
51	N-no, that can't...

9	[ML:undisp ] \nVery end of eternity
10	[ML:undisp ] \nThe final day has come to an end, it’s gone for good
11	[ML:undisp ] \nI would then slowly close my eyes
12	[ML:undisp ] \nAnd be cuddled by the shining memory piece
13	[ML:undisp ] \nI will trace back all the memories with you
14	[ML:undisp ] \nThat’s the only wish I have
15	[ML:undisp ] \nThe last day with you
16	[ML:undisp ] \nwas truly magical
17	[ML:undisp ] \nThe frozen time began to flow
18	[ML:undisp ] \nAt last the longest night has gone and brought in light
19	[ML:undisp ] \nI felt myself melt in the morning light
20	[ML:undisp ] \nThe final grain of sand has dropped
21	[ML:undisp ] \nI will slowly so quietly fall into sleep
22	[ML:undisp ] \nI see you gently fade away
23	[ML:undisp ] \nYour silhouette has gone the other side of the mist
24	[ML:undisp ] \nAnd all the memories
25	[ML:undisp ] \nwith no sound so quiet

34	[ML:undisp ] \nIf you would let me, I will give back a handful

1	Hey there, Rex.\nThat ship caught your eye?
2	Well, of course!
3	Yeah, I guess it's not easy to miss.
4	Never knew they made ships this big\nwithout a Titan at the core.
5	I can't even begin to imagine\nhow the whole thing works.
6	Indeed.
7	Do you know whose ship it is?
8	Some clients of the Chairman, I think.\nDon't know the details.
9	Huh, I see...
10	I know you're curious, but don't go\nclimbing on board or anything, OK?
11	I'm not that crazy...
12	Anyway, I've gotta get back to work.
13	All right, then.\nSee you round, Garram!
fev01070120_ms.json
1	I don't have any business on the\nhigher floors right now.
fev01100155_ms.json
1	Right then...
2	There are plenty of preparations to\nmake, but first off I should probably\ncheck in with Gramps.
3	If I just took off on a some random ship\nwithout telling him, I'm sure he'd give\nme hell later when I came back!
4	I'd better head down the stairs and\nback to Goldmouth Return Port.
fev01110125_ms.json
1	Now that I've got Gramps's permission,\njust about...I'd better start making\npreparations for this mission.
2	A hundred grand to spend...that\nsure is an exciting prospect!
3	I could buy a whole new cutting-edge\nsalvaging suit...
4	But no, I can't splurge this all at once.\nThe folks back home need this money\nmore than I do.
5	I'll hold off on making any big\npurchases, and just head to\nShynini's Accessories.
6	Always best to be prepared for\nanything! I might end up fighting\na Crustip like on my last salvage.
fev01110150_ms.json
1	Right, I've got the accessory I wanted\nand I'm all sorted for food.
2	I think that should just about do it.
3	There's still time left before I have to\nleave, so maybe I'll rest up at the inn.
4	I could head back to Gramps to rest,\nbut he might try to give me another\nlecture, so...yeah, the inn seems best.
5	I have plenty of cash left, and it\ncan't hurt to rest in a nice comfy\nbed once in a while.
6	The inn should be just past Rumbletum\nCanteen. Let's get moving!
fev01110151_ms.json
1	This really is so different from sleeping\nin that little hut on Gramps's back.
2	For some reason I even feel like\nI've got a bit stronger!
3	Anyway, better head to\nthe meet-up point.
4	It was at Goldmouth Exit Dock\ndown on the ground floor, right?
5	I guess there's still time to look around\nGoldmouth a bit longer if I want to...
6	But I shouldn't dawdle too long!
fev01130125_ms.json
1	We should be reaching the uncharted\nzone tomorrow, but there's plenty of\ntime left until then.
2	I guess I could go and talk with\nthe clients for a bit?
3	I still don't know as much about\nthem as I'd like to.
4	Besides, it's not every day you get\nto talk to real Drivers!
5	Oh, and once I'm done with them,\nI'd better go see Monell.
6	I'm meant to be on lookout duty\ntonight - he won't be very pleased\nif I never show up.
fev02100125_ms.json
1	Hang on a moment, guys.
2	Is it just me, or is the Cloud Sea level\nhigher than it was before?
3	I think you're right.
4	Guess it must be what they\ncall high tide.
5	The Cloud Sea level changes\nbecause of the Gormott Titan\nwalking through it, right?
6	At times, the clouds reach scarcely\nup to the Titan's ankles...
7	While at other times, like now, the\nclouds are around its belly.
8	With the clouds at this height, I guess\nwe won't be able to get back to the\nplace where we made camp.
9	Indeed... That area will be submerged\nbeneath the clouds.
10	But the Titan's always moving,\nso I'm sure the clouds will be lower\nagain sooner or later.
11	Quite right.
12	I'd heard about stuff like this, but it's\nkind of amazing seeing it first-hand.
13	You don't get phenomena like\nthis in Argentum, or in Leftheria,\nthat's for sure.
14	Alrest really is a big place.
15	All right, that's enough gawping.\nLet's get going - Torigoth is so\nclose now, I can smell it.
fev02210125_ms.json
1	Tora, do you have any ingredients\nI could work with?
2	Just what in the pantry there.\nNot much really. Tora sorry!
3	It doesn't seem wise to go out and buy\nmore supplies, so we'll just have to\nmake do with what we have.
4	Let's see what we've got, then.
5	Glitterspuds, Sumpkins...\nOh, and here's an Oil Oyster and\na single Meaty Carrot.
6	And Hot Oranges too!\nThese aren't bad ingredients at all!
7	All foods that can be eaten with no\ncooking. That how Tora usually eat!
8	That's...a bit depressing.
9	We aren't much better ourselves,\nyou know!
10	I guess you're right...
11	So what do you think, Pyra?\nCan you make anything with this?
12	Yes, I think this should be enough!
13	I'll just use the kitchen, OK?
fev02250125_ms.json
1	Did Rex-Rex know? They recruiting\nover there for new Drivers.
2	Yeah, I saw that earlier when we\nfirst arrived in the city.
3	Rex-Rex should try too!\nChance of success basically 100%!
4	I'm wanted by the Ardainian Empire\nright now, remember? It seems like a\nbad idea to make myself conspicuous...
5	Rex-Rex make good point...
6	Tora was just too curious to see\nwhat kind of Blade Rex-Rex awaken...
7	At any rate, I don't need to awaken\na Blade, do I? I've already got Pyra.
8	Come now, Rex. Don't tell me you\nthought Drivers could only bond with\na single Blade!
9	What? Is that not right?
10	Not at all. Many Drivers have\nmore than one.
11	With Nia gone, we're a bit short on\nnumbers right now. We might not hold\nup all that well in a fight...
12	Perhaps it would actually be a good\nidea to get yourself a new Blade.
13	A new Blade opens up new possibilities\nin battle, after all.
14	Hmmmm...
15	It would stop you from putting so much\nstrain on Pyra, as well. Seems like a\ngood thing all round, if you ask me.
16	Well, if Pyra doesn't mind, I guess\nit couldn't hurt to try.
17	I don't have any objections.\nThe more the merrier!
18	Then it settled!
19	The question is, where are we going\nto get ourselves a Core Crystal?
20	Now that's one question I can answer!
21	I happen to have one stored away\nfor just such an occasion.
22	Where Gramps hide Core Crystal\nwith such small body...?
23	The key to awakening a new Blade\nis to foster a powerful resonance with\nthe Driver's spirit.
24	Focus your whole mind on the\nCore Crystal as you touch it.
25	And try to hold a clear picture in\nyour mind of the Blade you wish\nto awaken.
26	I'm not sure I really understand,\nbut I'll give it a try.
27	I hope you awaken a wonderful Blade!
fev02250127_ms.json
1	That looks like a good one!
2	Meh meh! Fur always stand on\nend whenever Tora see Driver\nresonate with crystal. So cool!
3	Hey, don't look at me like that, you're\nmaking me feel weird!
4	Well, looks like we've got a new\nrecruit, anyway. Let's go and find out\nwhat happened to Nia!
5	Rex... Not so fast!
6	Huh? What's up?
7	Aren't you going to kit your new\nBlade out...?
8	You can tune up the weapon with a\nCore Chip from that smithy there.
9	If Rex-Rex never use Core Chip before\nthen now very good time to start!
10	You can really tell the difference\nbetween a Driver who uses Core Chips\nand one who doesn't...
11	I'm starting to understand...
12	Now for the main topic...
13	That over there is an Aux Core Shop.
14	I don't suppose you had a lot of call to\ngo in there before you became a Driver!
15	You're right about that...
16	I used to wonder what all that strange\ngear was for, though...
17	Perhaps we should head over and\ngive it a try, then!
18	Aux Cores are just the thing for\nsupplementing a Blade's power.
19	There all different types! Some boost\ndefense, some make strong against\ninsects, or stronger at night-time, meh!
20	The number of Aux Cores you can\nequip varies from Blade to Blade, mind.
21	Interesting stuff...
22	Now, this is the important part,\nso listen up.
23	Usually when you get an Aux Core, it's\nin an empty state. You won't boost\nyour Blade with it empty!
24	OK. So how do you fix that then?
25	Huh... I see!
26	So this gizmo here makes Aux Cores\nusable...
27	You catch on fast...
28	That's right! This machine takes\ncollectibles and raw Aux Cores and\nrefines them into something useful!
29	Here's one you can have a go with. I've\nbeen saving it up for this very occasion!
30	Rex-Rex! Best not to think about\nwhere he stash it!
31	Yes, Tora's right about that... It's not\nmuch good without collectibles,\nthough... Here.
32	Meh meh! He really have a lot stashed\naway there...
33	You're good to go, Rex!\nRefine it!
34	Got it!
35	And as soon as we're done, let's go and\nlook for some info about Nia!
fev02270125_ms.json
1	So...what do you actually need\nto finish this artificial Blade?
2	One Perfect Range Sensor and\nthree Bion Connectors!
3	I don't think I've ever heard of\neither of those...
4	Perfect Range Sensor supplements\nfunction of eyes in artificial Blade.
5	Quite pricey item, but very important.
6	And the Bion Connectors?
7	That have many uses, but mostly\nto prevent hat fall off.
8	Would an ordinary piece of string\nnot suffice...?
9	So, um...where can we buy these items?
10	At Margia's Odds & Ends!
11	Is just off to the left after\nentering Torigoth city.
12	I'm sure we must have walked\npast that area before.
13	All right! Let's go!
fev02290123_ms.json
1	Before we leaving, Tora want to explain\nsomething to Rex-Rex and Poppi!
2	Explain what, Masterpon?
3	It about this advanced gaming device!
4	I did wonder what that thing was for.\nSo it's for playing games?
5	Yes! Game is called Tiger! Tiger!
6	Is hidden gem that Grampypon make\nfor Tora when Tora was littlepon!
7	It looks like it's seen better days...
8	Tora turned on power just now,\nso should be possible to play!
9	Rex-Rex! Give game a try!
10	Hmmmm...
11	It does sound kind of fun, but I\nwouldn't want to get hooked on\na game while Nia needs rescuing...
12	Wait wait wait!
13	Playing this game can earn prizes!\nSpecial parts for power up Poppi!
14	Parts for Poppi?
15	Grampypon make this game in hopes\nthat it reveal true purpose when Poppi\nfinally complete!
16	So if friends think Poppi a bit weak,\nor just want more amazing power,\nplay game and get new upgrade!
17	I...guess that makes sense.\nI'll give it a go, then.
18	That is wise decision!
19	Tiger! Tiger! GO!
20	Shall Tora explain basics? After all, \nRex-Rex is a little wet behind ears...
21	Use directional buttons to move!\nUse A Button to attack!
22	So, that is basics. Tora let Rex-Rex\nfigure out rest by Rex's self!\nLearning is best by doing, meh!
fev02290125_ms.json
1	Skills of Rex-Rex quite impressive.
2	Rex not pro salvager for nothing.
3	You think so...?
4	I think your experiences salvaging\nreally came in useful!
5	Not that I don't appreciate the\ncompliments, but we should hurry\nand rescue Nia.
6	Rex-Rex not very good at games?
7	I...I can't help it, can I?!\nIt was my first time playing!
8	Poppi think practice make perfect.
9	A-anyway, let's focus on Nia for now!
10	So, how are we going to get\nonto that Titan battleship\nwhere Nia's being held...?
11	From here, is easiest to go up to top of\nstairs, cross bridge, then pass under\ngate, then you're at Garagorm's Arch!
12	Will the Ardainian guards not spot us?
13	Area around Ardainian base heavily\nguarded, but up to Garagorm's Arch\nshould be no problem!
14	All right. Let's head there for now!
15	Poppi will do best to help.
16	As luck would have it, the Cloud Sea\nlooks to be ebbing just now. We had\nbest aim for the root Pyra mentioned.
17	The root was stretchy-stretching\njust past Garagorm's Arch!
fev02360125_ms.json
1	Looks like this is the way to the hangar.
2	Sounds like a way out of here!
3	Meh-meh-meh...\nDoor is locked, no way to open!
4	Even Poppi probably not able to\nbreak through this...
5	But we're so close!
6	Rex. Take a look over there.
7	Good eyes. Could that be the\nswitch to open it?
8	We don't have many options\nbut to try.
9	If it does open the door, we will surely\nbe able to escape through the hangar.
10	Then what are we waiting for?!
11	Looks like we have to leave this room\nfor now and find a way up there.
fev03030125_ms.json
1	Hey, Tora... The place where this\nUmon guy lives isn't affected by the\nCloud Sea tides, is it?
2	Hmm? Why Rex-Rex ask?
3	Well, I noticed the Cloud Sea's been\npretty low ever since we went off to\nsave Nia. It's still low now, right?
4	I was worrying that depending on\nthe situation, we might be forced\nto find a different route.
5	Rex has a point. The Cloud Sea tides\ncan have a marked effect on the areas\nyou are able to traverse.
6	Sometimes the Cloud Sea may allow\nyou to swim to places that were once\nout of reach...
7	But equally it can submerge previously\nreachable areas, halting your progress.
8	Exactly. So I was wondering whether\nwe need to worry about any of that\nwhere we're going now.
9	That make sense!
10	But is no problem.\nPath to shipyard of Umon not\naffected by Cloud Sea at all!
11	That's good to know.
12	If it was somewhere we could only\nreach at high tide, we'd have to rest\nup somewhere until the clouds rise.
13	That doesn't sound so bad to me.
14	Frankly, I'd welcome a well-earned\nrest at an inn while we wait for the\ntide to change.
15	No offense, Rex, but your helmet isn't\nalways the most comfortable abode!
16	Yes, yes...you can always have a\nstretch and a lie down next time we\nvisit the inn at Torigoth.
17	For now though, we go to\nshipyard of Umon!
fev03120125_ms.json
1	He said to follow him, but I'm\nnot seeing him anywhere...
2	What an annoying old guy.
3	Where do you think Vandham went?
4	I guess we just explore the village\nand hope we run into him?
5	Good idea. It's always best to get\nthe lay of the land when you arrive\nin a new place.
6	Besides, didn't he say we should\n"get ready" for something?
7	He's not exactly big on explaining\nhimself, is he?
8	There's quite a few shops around\nhere, so let's stock up on anything\nwe need while we look for him.
fev03150125_ms.json
1	You sure know how to keep\na guy waiting, rookies.
2	Very sorry for wait!
3	Is fault of Vandham for rushing\noff ahead...
4	Hahahah! Sorry 'bout that.
5	I guess you've already seen him when\nwe fought earlier, but let's introduce\nourselves properly, shall we?
6	I'm Roc, Vandham's Blade.
7	Pleasure to meet you all.
8	The pleasure's all ours!
9	I noticed you used an unusual\nstyle of weapon?
10	Yeah, they're called Dual Scythes.\nEven around here, I never met anyone\nbut Vandham who can use them.
11	Wow. Big man very amazing!
12	Hahahah!
13	Don't flatter him too much.\nHe'll let it go to his head.
14	Vandham only have one Blade then?
15	Yeah, pretty much.
16	I know most Drivers have a few, so they\ncan change up their strategies in battle,\nbut me, Roc's all I've ever needed!
17	Big man really is amazing...
18	Hahahah!
19	Sounds to me like you just can't\nbe bothered to think up more than\none strategy, eh, old man?
20	Gahahah!
21	Well, now that we all know each other,\nlet's get down to business.
22	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]He just dodged the question...
23	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]An expert dodge, to be sure...
fev04060125_ms.json
1	Now, to get to Indol, we'll need to...
2	Rex!
3	Zuo...
4	Don't worry about us. You just carry\non with your own journey.
5	...is what I'd like to say, but could you\ncome back to Garfont and speak to\nYew for a moment first?
6	There's something we need\nto talk to you about.\nSomething the boss left behind.
7	Something from Vandham...?
8	We'll give you the details once you\nget back to Garfont. Don't keep us\nwaiting, yeah?
9	Listen, um...
fev04080125_ms.json
1	OK, so ships to the Ardainian Empire\nshould be leaving from Goldmouth\nFlight Deck on the fourth floor.
2	I think there's a reception desk there\nwhere I should be able to charter one.
3	Time to get moving!
fev04120105_ms.json
1	Where do ships to the Ardainian\nEmpire leave from again?
2	Goldmouth Flight Deck.\nIt's up on the fourth floor.
3	Right, gotcha.
4	Shall we get moving, then?
5	Ardainian Empire sound so grand!\nTora cannot wait to see what it like!
fev04120195_ms.json
1	Finally, we actually get to depart\nfor Mor Ardain.
2	Quite the strenuous detour\nwe ended up taking there.
3	Masterpon probably forgotten where\nwe even meant to get on ship.
4	Tora remember perfectly!\n...Tenth floor, was it?
5	Goldmouth not have half\nthat many floors!
6	It's the fourth floor.\nGoldmouth Flight Deck, to be precise.
7	Shall we get going, then?
8	Try to keep a tight hold on any\nvaluables, eh, Rex?
9	I know, I know!
fev04130125_ms.json
1	Finally, we made it.
2	So good to be on land again!
3	It was a pretty long voyage.
4	This place seem more empty\nthan Poppi expected though.
5	Most likely because this is a small port,\nseparate from the main city.
6	That must be it. So I suppose our next\ntask is to journey to the capital.
7	From what I heard in the ship, if we\njust head out of the port to the right,\nit should be a straight path there.
8	Not too far off, then. Still, this is our\nfirst time in this country, so we'd better\nkeep our wits about us.
9	Agreed. It might be best to make\npreparations before we head out.
fev04180125_ms.json
1	Ah! Over there!
2	Come on, friends! Chase after, quick!
fev04180150_ms.json
1	Wait...please!
2	She not listening?\nNothing for it but to chase!
fev04180175_ms.json
1	Waaaaaait!
2	Masterpon...
3	We not letting her get away!\nPoppi help chase too!\nGo as fast as possible!
fev04260125_ms.json
1	Right, then... So how are we supposed\nto track down this Lila?
2	Can we not just ask around in the\nstreets like we usually do?
3	Might not be that helpful...\nIt was night when it happened,\nso I doubt many people saw her.
4	Meh-heh-heh...\nTime for Tora to show genius skills!
5	You have some kind of idea, Tora?
6	Tora sure it must be Dadapon who\nfinish building Lila.
7	Yes, you told us as much last night.
8	And Poppi made based on blueprints\nTora got from Dadapon.
9	So Lila and Poppi use basically\nsame design.
10	Which would mean...they are\nconstructed from very similar\nmaterials?
11	Exactly yes!
12	Oh, I get it...
13	If we ask around to find out who's been\nbuying those materials in Mor Ardain,\nit might lead us to whoever built her.
14	Rare good suggestion from Masterpon!
15	So, Tora, what materials exactly would\nthey need to make an artificial Blade?
16	Well... Ether furnace is obvious,\nbut apart from that, also need...
17	Tetra-Circle!
18	Snake Joint!
19	Black Ash!
20	Delta Vessel!
21	Rabbit Diode!
22	Morph Orb!
23	Photonic Coil!
24	Fairy-Tale Belt Pulley!
25	Arc Indicator!
26	Insect Chip!
27	Perfect Range Sensor!
28	Bion Connector!
29	Wait, wait, wait!
30	Nobody's gonna be able to\nremember all that!
31	Tora not even say one-thirtieth\nof list yet...
32	There were a couple of names in there\nthat sounded familiar, though.
33	That Bion Connector was meant to be\neasy to salvage around Gormott, right?
34	Actually, almost impossible to find\nanywhere OTHER than Gormott\naround this season.
35	So whoever we're looking for would\nhave to import them from Gormott.\nAm I right?
36	Perhaps we might find some leads\nat Port Anangham.
37	We don't have much else to go on,\nso it's worth a try.
fev04300125_ms.json
1	This must be the abandoned factory\nwe were told about.
2	Dadapon and Lila inside here!
3	It seems likely, yes.
4	Door is stubborn! Not opening!
5	I guess the security isn't a\ncomplete pushover.
6	Search for different way in!\nNo point standing around! Hurry-hurry!
7	Yeah, let's have a look around.
8	Could we perhaps enter through\nthat window?
9	We'd need to find a way up there first...
10	Time for exploring then!
fev05150125_ms.json
1	How did you find it, visiting your\nhometown after so long?
2	I was surprised how much the kids had\ngrown, but apart from that, it was all\njust how I remembered. Which is nice.
3	Anyway, I'm all rested up and\nraring to go! I'm ready to lead\nthe way to the port.
4	Thank you very much, Master Rex.
5	Well, it's not like it's very far.\nIt's just on the next island over.
6	Come on, let's get going.
fev05210125_ms.json
1	This is Seoris Plaza.
2	Wow...it's pretty huge!
3	Busy, too.
4	I daresay many people gather here\non religious pilgrimages.
5	Precisely correct. Many people arrive\nin Indol with each coming day.
6	And the building you see ahead is\nthe Indoline Sanctum.
7	Impressive isn't the half of it.
8	How d'you like it, eh?\nReally makes you appreciate the\nmajesty of the Praetorium, right?
9	Where do YOU get off sounding\nso proud, Shellhead?
10	It's magnificent. Truly magnificent.
11	Rooms have already been made\nready for you. You'll find them to\nthe left as you enter the Sanctum.
12	We get to stay in big fancy building?!
13	You are our honored guests here,\nafter all.
14	Quite amazing!
15	Now then, shall we go?
fev05270125_ms.json
1	It's almost time...
2	I don't know about you guys, but\nI'm starting to get a bit nervous.
3	Be careful not to say anything\ndisrespectful.
4	I know, I know...
5	The audience chamber's just across\nthe courtyard. We'll be there in a jiffy.
6	Well, we can hardly keep the Praetor\nhimself waiting. Shall we head out?
fev05320125_ms.json
1	Sorry to keep you waiting, everyone.
2	Welcome back!
3	How was it, Pyra?
4	Mostly he was just talking with Mythra.
5	They knew each other before, right?
6	Yes...
7	Honored guests.
8	Oh, Fan.
9	You must be tired after today's events,\nso please rest here another night.
10	She may have a point...\nAll we really did was talk to Praetor\nAmalthus, but I feel quite worn out.
11	Let's take them up on that offer.
12	Yeah, sounds like a good plan.
13	Tora not object! Want to sleep on\nfluffy-puffy bed every night!
14	Then let's return to the Sanctum.
fev05390125_ms.json
1	So how we get to Temperantia?
2	If Senator Roderich is here, I assume\nthere must be an Ardainian military\nvessel stationed at the port.
3	Then we go to port and get on\nArdainian Titan battleship!
4	All right, then.\nThere's no time to waste - let's go!
fev06040150_ms.json
1	Morning, folks.\nEveryone sleep well?
2	Not a wink...
3	Figured as much.
4	Let's take a nice walk over to the hall\nwhere the emergency summit's being\nheld. Clear our heads a little.
5	Someone's gotta escort Mòrag\nover there, right?
6	I think I would be perfectly capable\nof finding my own way...
7	And Mythra's meant to be attending\ntoo, right?
8	Apparently, yes.
9	See? We might as well all head over.
10	I guess you're right...\nLet's go, then.
fev06040175_ms.json
1	Through here is the venue for the\nsummit of nations.
2	I must apologize, but entry is forbidden\nto all but the official representatives of\neach nation.
3	I guess this is as far as we go.
4	Yes... Brighid and I will proceed\nto the summit.
5	I'm coming with you.
6	Who invited you, Shellhead?
7	'Scuse me?
8	In case you've forgotten, I'm a prince\nof Tantal. I'm perfectly qualified to\nrepresent my nation here.
9	Oh, yeah. I always forget.
10	What do I have to do to get\nsome respect around here, eh?
11	Sorry, sorry. It's just you're so...\napproachable. For a prince.
12	Uh-huh. I'll leave it at that.
13	And so are you, Mythra.\nRemember?
14	I guess...
15	I'm not sure I like it, but I suppose\nI have to play my part in all this.
16	Rex, you head back to our chambers\nwith the others and wait for us.
17	No problems!
18	Hang on, who needs babysitting here?
19	You figure it out.
20	Right. Sure.
21	Be careful in there, OK, Mythra?
22	Don't worry.\nI'll handle this just fine.
fev06100125_ms.json
1	Morning, folks. You're looking a bit\nbetter-slept than yesterday.
2	Pretty much.
3	Fan's state funeral is to be held\ntoday, is it not?
4	Yeah, I think it was meant to be\nhappening in Seoris Plaza, right\noutside the Sanctum.
5	You'll be going, right, chum?
6	Yes. It would be wrong for me not to.
7	Seoris Plaza very not far away.\nTime to go! Quick-quick!
8	Masterpon so bossy sometimes...
fev06110125_ms.json
1	That was quite the grand funeral\nceremony.
2	It spoke volumes as to just how much\nFan was loved by her people.
3	The Goddess of Indol won't be\nan easy position to replace.
4	Hey, Rex. What are you going\nto do from here on out?
5	If we're going to reach the World Tree,\nwe'll need the Praetor's help, but...
6	Master Rex! There you are.
7	Praetor Amalthus wishes to\nspeak with you. He is waiting\nin the audience chamber.
8	That's perfect timing, then.\nMaybe he wants to talk about\nthe World Tree?
9	I am afraid I cannot say.
10	Well, there is only one way to find out.
11	Let's get ourselves on over to\nthat audience chamber, then.
fev06120180_ms.json
1	So Zeke, you're going to be guiding\nus to Tantal, right?
2	Sure am.
3	But let's head back to our chambers\nbefore we talk about it.
4	This isn't exactly the place for\ndiscussing stuff.
5	Back to our room? Got it.
fev06140107_ms.json
1	Right...let's head for Goetuis Port!
2	Can we make it a leisurely walk?
3	I guess...? Why?
4	It's been yonks since I last went\nhome to Tantal.
5	I've been thinking of Indol as my home\nso long now, it feels weird to leave.\nI want to enjoy my last moments here.
6	You can be shockingly sentimental\nsometimes.
7	I know! Shocking, isn't it?
8	Shaddup, you two.
9	Gonna take some Indoline presents for\nthe folk you haven't seen in a while?
10	Hah! As if my old man would\nwant any of that.
11	C'mon, let's start walking.\nTo Goetuis Port!
12	You could grab a swig of Odifa\nalong the way!
13	They don't have that stuff in Tantal,\nso this could be your last chance!
14	I said shaddup already!
fev06380125_ms.json
1	Now, the path to the Omega Fetter\nisn't an easy one.
2	This city, Theosoir, is positioned a \nlong way above the Genbu Drifts.
3	If you head out the palace and down\nto the left, you'll see the ruins of a\nplace called Theospiti Temple.
4	Ruins? Even though inside city?
5	Yep. They really are ruined, too.\nPractically rotted away!
6	Anyway, past the temple ruins is\nsomething called the Theosoir\nRear Gate. We head out through there.
7	Then we have to follow the pillars\na long way down.
8	Urgh... Sounds like a pain in the \narse of a journey.
9	But must be quick-quick!\nCome on friends, to Genbu Drifts!
10	Hey, I'm not done yet.
11	Once we get to Genbu Drifts,\nwe have to head across it.
12	That gets us to a place called the\nGreat Pillar Passage. The Omega\nFetter's at the end of that.
13	Sound too long... Tora already\ngetting tired just listening.
14	Too soon for getting tired, Masterpon!
15	This is no time for joking around, Tora.
16	We have to give this our all,\nto protect Zeke's home!
17	Of course!
18	Right! Let's all do what we can!
19	Thanks, guys. I owe you big time!
20	So, first we head out of here\nto the left, got that?
21	Tora remember just fine!
fev07140125_ms.json
1	Come on, Rex. For the moment,\nlet's return to Fonsett Village.
2	Back to the village?
3	I'll explain everything in detail\nonce we get there. Just head\nto Fonsett for now.
4	All right...
fev07400125_ms.json
1	What are we going to do from\nhere on out?
2	There's no point hanging around here...\nit's only going to make us feel worse.
3	Let's head back to Fonsett and\ntalk there.
4	Agreed.
5	Let's get going, then. We'll get\nsomewhere comfortable and then\nthink about the hard stuff.
fev07410160_ms.json
1	Now the question is, how are we\ngetting to the Cliffs of Morytha?
2	I doubt just any sailor would be\nwilling to give us a ride there.
3	Yeah, they're not gonna be keen on\ngoing that close to the World Tree.
4	In that case, I will charter a\nmilitary vessel.
5	It may not be the most efficient\nroute, but it will be reliable, I can\nassure you that much.
6	That our Special Inquisithingy!
7	Special Inquisitor.
8	Haha... Some might consider this an\nabuse of my privileges, you know.
9	So are we headed to the port at\nHardhaigh Palace in Mor Ardain?
10	Yes.
11	Brighid, would you send word ahead\nthat we are coming?
12	Of course, Lady Mòrag.\nLeave it to me.
13	Right, then let's get moving!
fev07410165_ms.json
1	Lady Mòrag!\nWe have been expecting you.
2	You have heard my business here,\nI presume? We require passage to\nthe Cliffs of Morytha.
3	Yes, ma'am!\nThe preparations are all complete.
4	I doubt this will be an easy voyage...\nAre you sure you're up to it?
5	Absolutely, ma'am!
6	By order of His Majesty the Emperor,\nonly the finest of sailors have been\ngathered for this assignment!
7	I'll have to thank him for that later...
8	Well then, shall we depart?
9	As you wish!
fev08090150_ms.json
1	So...where do we go from here?
2	Well, there's no point heading back,\nso I guess we just press on?
3	I guess so...\nForward is the only way.
4	We'll just have to head over that\nfallen building.
5	We may have him with us, but he's not\nin the best shape, and we have fewer\nfighters around than we're used to.
6	We should exercise caution\nas we proceed.
fev08090175_ms.json
1	Time to take break?
2	I think it might be.
3	Much as I would like to find Lady\nMòrag without a moment's delay,\nit's not wise to overexert ourselves.
4	Rex in particular is only Driver\nwe have right now, so would be\ndangerous for Rex to tire self out.
5	I wouldn't say I'm worn out just yet...
6	But you're probably right.\nBetter to be safe than sorry.
7	Jin... Do you think this area\nseems safe enough?
8	Yes. I don't sense any hostile presence.
9	Then breaktime it is!
fev08140130_ms.json
1	I think we're all rested enough.\nLet's move out.
2	We're slowly but surely getting closer\nto that World Tree...
3	Poppi just hope Masterpon and others\nalso heading for World Tree...
4	Hoping is all we can do on that front.
5	Even if we don't meet up with them\non the way, I think we should wait\na while at the base of the Tree.
6	That does seem best.
7	What's the holdup?\nAre we leaving or not?
8	I'm coming, I'm coming!
9	Honestly, the nerve of this guy...
10	It looks like the next stage of our\njourney will have to be through\nthat opening.
11	Yeah... Let's get moving!
fev08150175_ms.json
1	I'm going over there.
2	The Tornan Titan... Looks like he's\nquite eager to see it up close.
3	I think anyone would be curious...
4	Come on, let's go with him.
5	Agreed.
fev09190175_ms.json
1	Indol...it's...
2	It sinking...
3	Never thought I'd see the day\nwhen Torna of all people would\nbe saving our hides.
4	Mikhail...
5	We can't let his effort go to waste.
6	You're right.
7	Let's go after Jin!
8	I have to have a word with him\nabout the answer I found!

2	But, we only just went...\nIs there something special you\nwanted to do there?
3	I just had something that I\nwanted to ask your parents\nabout.
4	We didn't get much time before,\nso I want to talk to them\nproperly this time, y'know?
5	Oh she's got a good attitude,\nthat one.

1	Hey, guys! Why don't we go and check\nout the Forgotten Waste?
2	Sounds great. Why exactly?
3	Well, I mean, I don't know if there's\nanything there exactly. Let's just go\nand see what it's like.

2	Really? What kind of thing?
3	It's...well...
4	Look, why don't we go to\nthe Fonsa Myma Commercial\nDistrict, and I'll tell you there.
5	Very well.

2	Rex. I have a favor to ask.
3	A favor?
4	Would you take me somewhere\nwhere you can get a full view of\nGarfont and tell me about the place?
5	Sure. No problem!
kizunainn019_ms.json
1	Brighid... I was thinking I'd\ngo to Temperantia and\ntake a look at Aeshma.
2	You're going to the Titan Weapon Dig\nSite? Maybe I'll tag along.
3	Tora want to come too!\nTora very interested in Judician Titan\nweaponry!

11	Well, why don't we go and take a look?
kizunainn023_ms.json
1	Hey, Mòrag. Do you know if there's\na place round here with a good view\nof the whole town?
2	A good view of Alba Cavanich...\nHmmm...
3	As I recall, you can see a great vista\nfrom Hardhaigh Palace... Like the\nsecond Wing Area, Grian, for instance.
4	That sounds awesome!\nThink you could show me up there?
kizunainn024_ms.json
1	Hey, Gramps. There's something\nI'd like to talk to you about.
2	Of course, Rex. You know I'm\nalways willing to lend you an ear.
3	OK! Let's go to the Canyon of Husks\nat Spirit Crucible Elpys and I'll tell you\nall about it!
4	Oh... Seems an awfully\nlong way to go...

4	Sure! Let's do it!

kizunainn066_ms.json
1	Sorry to bother you, everyone, but\nthere's somewhere I'd like to visit.
2	What's all this about, then?
3	I was hoping to take a look at the\nStele of Judgment in Spirit Crucible\nElpys. Would you take me there?
4	I mean, sure, I guess...\nBut are you sure? That place is\npretty tough on Blades.
5	I'm always up for a challenge!
kizunainn067_ms.json

1	Hey, um...
2	Hey... There's a house in Torigoth\nthat I'm a little curious about.
3	It doesn't seem anyone's\nliving there right now.
4	Would you like to come with\nme to check it out?
kizunainn074_ms.json
1	Hey, I heard they just stocked up on\nsome old books at Reedirait Bookstore\nin Argentum. Why don't we go look?
2	The innkeeper here said they've got\nloads of bargains!
3	So, how about it?\nAren't you interested?
kizunainn077_ms.json

kizunainn079_ms.json
1	I trust you're feeling refreshed!\nI have a message for you.
2	It said to bring Herald to Theospiti\nTemple without delay.
3	I didn't catch the name of\nthe man who left it. And\nhe cleared off sharpish too.
4	But that's what he said!
kizunainn080_ms.json
1	Oh! This very bad!
2	Vale not come out of room!\nWe cannot leave inn if Vale not come\nout from room!

kizunatalk001_ms.json
1	...
2	Well, Pyra? Did you manage\nto talk to them?
3	I did. We had a pleasant chat.
4	What did you talk about?
5	Everything that's happened since\nI met you.
6	And I told them not to worry because\nI'm going to do everything in my\npower to look after you.
7	I'm sorry, what? I can look after\nmyself, thank you very much.
8	I think not.
9	If you go off on your own, you'll just\nget yourself into trouble.
10	Hohoho! Already bickering like you're\na married couple, eh?
11	Hey! Gramps!
12	C-couple?! But really, I didn't mean\nto...
13	Ahahaha! It was just a joke.
14	Besides, you have to have that sort of\nmettle to deal with Rex.
15	Come on, Azurda, cut it out!
16	Anyhow, we've done what we have\nto here, right? Time we should be\ngetting back.
17	Oh, we're leaving already? Can't\nwe talk for a little more?
18	We can do that when we get back,\ncan't we?
19	That's true, but the two of us rarely\nget the opportunity to talk alone like\nthis.
20	I'm not sure you can say "alone" when\nwe've got Gramps tagging along...
21	Eh? This old fogey getting in the way?\nYou want me to shove off?
22	No one's telling you to shove off,\nAzurda. Stop being such a child!
23	Hohoho! Youth is a beautiful thing.
24	All right, what was it you wanted\nto talk about?
25	What should I ask?
26	Do you miss your mom and dad?
27	Have you always sent money home?
28	Hmm...I don't really know.\nWhat makes you ask?
29	Well, I'm a Blade, so I don't really know\nmuch about parents. I was wondering\nwhat it's like to have them.
30	Hmm... I'm not sure how to explain it.
31	All I know about my parents is\nwhat Gramps and Auntie Corinne\nhave told me.
32	Honestly, I have hardly any memory\nof them myself. It doesn't really feel\nreal.
33	Isn't that sort of sad?
34	Not "sad" exactly... I've just never\nreally thought much about them.
35	Oh, I see.
36	I mean, it's Gramps and the\nvillagers who've looked after\nme this whole time.
37	They're my family. Everyone in the\nvillage is.
38	And when you've got all these mums,\ndads, brothers and sisters, it's kind of\nhard to feel sad, you know?
39	The downside to a big family is that\nyou can't go a day without getting an\nearful from someone, eh!
40	Hey, give it a rest!
41	Yeah, I've been sending money back\npretty much ever since I left the village\nto set off to become a salvager.
42	I mean, take a look around. There's\nnothing here.
43	Trade with other countries doesn't\nreally cut it, and being self-sufficient\nonly goes so far.
44	What I earn is a pittance, but it's better\nthan nothing, I think.
45	But it can't be easy for you either,\nliving the way you do...
46	You shouldn't push yourself so hard.
47	Mmm, I guess. But I can't really leave\nmy family out in the lurch either.
48	Your family? You mean the villagers?
49	That's right. Everyone in the village\nis like family to me.
50	I'll do everything in my power\nto help them!
51	They're all very grateful to Rex for\nhis work.
52	Never thought a mischievous brat like\nyou'd grow some backbone!
53	Who are you calling a brat?!
54	Hahaha!
55	What? What's so funny?
56	Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.
57	I just couldn't help but admire your\nway of thinking.
58	I'd love to have a family as big as\nyours, Rex.
59	What are you talking about, Pyra?\nYou're already part of the family.
60	...So can we take this as confession\nof love?
61	Very bold of you to do so in front\nof your parents, my boy!
62	Wha-?! Rex, hold on a second!
63	N-no! That's not what I was trying\nto say!
64	You, Nia, Mòrag, Zeke, and Tora\ntoo...
65	All of you... You're all family to me.
66	So there's no reason to feel sad or\nlonely, that's what I'm trying to say!
67	Huh, so much for the boy having\nbackbone. Sorry, Pyra, this one's\ngoing to be hard work.
68	...Hahaha! That's all right. I've got\na surprising amount of patience.
69	Oi! What are you two going on\nabout? Jeez...
kizunatalk002_ms.json
1	Hey, Brighid! I found something\ninteresting in that shop over there.
2	Interesting?
3	Yep.\nHere it is.
4	What is that thing?\nIt looks...quite grotesque...
5	Why, that's an Argentum Monkfish.
6	You are familiar with this creature,\nLady Mòrag?
7	It's a rare delicacy that is only found in\nthe waters around here. Rather tasty.
8	People...eat this monstrous fish thing?
9	It might not look appetizing, but\nI've heard the taste is divine.
10	Since it's so rare, I thought I'd cook\nsomething up with it, but I'm not\nsure how...
11	Mòrag, do you know?\nDo tell, please!
12	How should I respond...?
13	I'm not that great a cook...
14	...Very well, I'll do it.
15	Oh, no, that's fine!\nI'm happy to do the messy part.
16	I just need you to tell me the steps,\nand then if you could add the spices...
17	Well, if that is all, I suppose\nit should be...fine...
18	Are you certain, Lady Mòrag?\nAbout the spices and everything?
19	D-don't you worry.\nHave some faith in my taste buds...
20	Right then. So, first, how should we\ncook it...?
21	...A fine question.\nMany would eat it grilled, or sliced raw,\nbut I hear it tastes best in a stew.
22	Sounds great!\nWell then, Mòrag, can I ask you\nto get the stock ready?
23	Of course.\nIf I recall, that's made by boiling\nthe guts...
24	I think I can leave you to it then!\nI'll go buy the other ingredients.
25	...Roger.
26	...
27	...Brighid?
28	Yes, Lady Mòrag?
29	Do we have to begin by gutting\nthis ugly little creature?
30	Well, I should think so.\nCan you do it?
31	Erm... I'm not even really sure\nwhich part the guts are...
32	That would be the parts on the inside.\nConsider using a knife.
33	Right...
34	...Brighid?
35	Yes, what is it now?
36	The heart...\nThe heart is still beating!
37	What should I do?\nShould I deliver the coup de grâce?
38	I-indeed, that seems wise.\nWe don't want it fighting back.
39	Brighid!
40	It's...looking at me with those eyes,\nand moving those lips, like it's accusing\nme of something...
41	It's cursing me for taking its heart!
42	It's no use...\nI can't torment the dead any further...
43	Brighid, I'll leave the rest to you.
44	Wait just a minute!\nYou can't force me to\ndo your dirty work!
45	I'm sorry, but I must!
46	Lady Mòrag! Are you deserting\nin the face of the enemy?!
47	Lady Mòrag, if I may.\nIs this really wise...?
48	Oh, don't you worry yourself.
49	Shall we start by gutting the fish, then?
50	Excuse me?
51	What's the matter?
52	...Gut it? Gut this creature?
53	Well, yes.\nWe can't exactly cook it like that.
54	...Ahem. Understood.\nLife is a battlefield. Let us commence.
55	Show it who's boss, Lady Mòrag!
56	...
57	...Brighid.
58	Yes?
59	Please hold down its head.
60	Wh-wha...?!\nNo, I, er, that is...\nI'd rather not...touch it.
61	It's just a little tricky to make the\nincision when it keeps...staring at me...
62	Qu-quite true, but...
63	For the love of the Architect, do it!\nPlease, at least cover its eyes for me!
64	Y-yes, Ma'am.\nWe cannot let a mere fish\nget the best of us!
65	Eeeeeeeeeeek!
66	What's wrong?!
67	It...It looked me in the eye!\nIs this thing still alive?!
68	Can it be?!\nThen I must end it before it strikes!
69	It's opening its foul maw?!
70	Lady Mòrag, the enemy means to\neat us! Quickly, the finishing blow!
71	Very well! Hellfire!
72	No, wait!\nIf you do that, the food will be-
73	...Well, Brighid?
74	As befits the Flamebringer.\nThe foe is extinguished without a trace.
75	Phew. Our mission here is done.
76	What do you think you're doing?!\nThere's nothing left for us to eat!
kizunatalk003_ms.json
1	Malos is a powerful foe...
2	But we can't afford to give up now.
3	Indeed. If we give up hope here,\nthere will be nothing left of Alrest.
4	That'd leave all the people we care\nabout dead, and a whole bunch of\ninnocent folk besides.
5	That worst possible outcome...
6	But we're not in this alone.\nJin, the Torna guys, and everyone\nback on Alrest are counting on us.
7	We've run into all kinds of trouble\non the way, but we made it this far.
8	This may be the most formidable\nobstacle yet, but we can surpass it\nlike any other.
9	When friends all together,\nnothing impossible!
10	This is it. This is our final battle!
11	Let's show him what Drivers and\nBlades can do together!
12	Yeah!
kizunatalk004_ms.json
1	My Lady... Over there.\nThe capital's standing army.
2	I see 'em.
3	Let's keep our distance, yeah?\nBest let sleeping Gogols lie.
4	Good call...
5	Be not alarmed.
6	The troops that captured us were\nArdainian military, yes, but from the\nGormotti regiment.
7	Those aren't the same?
8	Quite different, in fact.
9	One can learn many things while in a\nTitan battleship's brig, and I made good\nuse of the opportunity.
10	Damn. They chucked me into solitary,\nso I don't know anything...
11	It does seem they have separate\nprocedures for Blades and Drivers...
12	In any case, once I abandoned thoughts\nof staging a break-out, I did make sure\nto keep my ears open for intelligence.
13	Did you hear anything else?
14	Let me think...
15	The soldiers over there are, as I said\npreviously, from the capital's garrison...
16	but those other ones actually belong to\nthe First Imperial Guard, 2nd Battalion.
17	Huh?\nWhat's the difference?
18	Beyond the bridge is Hardhaigh Palace,\nthe imperial residence. Therefore...
19	Oh, I've got it! The palace guards\nbelong to a different unit. Of course!
20	Indeed. Then, above the Imperial Guard\nrank and file, you have the Carraig\nspecial guard unit...
21	And higher yet, the Special Inquisitor...\nThe Flamebringer herself.
22	Wow...
23	Armies, man. I could never deal with\nall this hierarchy crap.
24	Ever heard the expression,\n"know thy enemy"...?
25	What else should I ask?
26	Nia, how was Torna organized?
27	Got any other good ones, Dromarch?
28	Torna...?\nIt was all centered around Jin.\nNot exactly structured, though.
29	But we all had our assignments.
30	What was yours, Nia?
31	I was...
32	Naptime specialist?
33	Shut it!\nI was, uh, general support.
34	I hadn't been there long, so I mostly\njust helped out with whatever.
35	Hah.\nNot much of a change, then.
36	It is as you say.
37	Stop making it sound like I'm some\nuseless layabout!
38	I mean, I can make ruska dumplings\nand stuff, so...
39	Well then, maybe we could cook\nsomething together?
40	M-mhm...\nOK, you're on!
41	My Lady, are you sure that's...
42	Both of you'll sing a different song\nwhen I stuff your faces with my food!
43	*sigh*...
44	You had best steel yourself,\nMaster Rex.
45	My lady's cooking is not what anyone\nwould call "conventionally tasty"...
46	Ugh...\nMaybe I shouldn't have riled her up...
47	The smallest unit in the Ardainian\narmy's structure is the ten-soldier\ndecade.
48	It includes eight foot soldiers alongside\nthe squad leader and a deputy.
49	Six to ten of these decades can then\nform a unit called a century.
50	But eight is the usual number.
51	Hah, neat...
52	Mm...
53	...Master Rex.\nYou did ask for a, "good one," correct?
54	I did.
55	Would you not say that was\na "good one," then?
56	Uh, which part?
57	I said that commonly, eight decades\nform a century. Eighty men...and yet,\nthey are a century.
58	Ohhhh, now I get it...
59	Rex...\nHe's done his best, so just\nthrow him a bone, will ya?
60	Ah, yeah, no, that was a very good one!\nUh-huh, very good.
61	I have doubts about your sincerity...
kizunatalk005_ms.json
1	Masterpon, Poppi have question.
2	Pursuit of learning is good thing.\nAsk anything and Tora will answer!
3	Cloud Sea clearly visible from here.
4	Height of Cloud Sea is different at\ndifferent times. Why height change?
5	Meh-meh?!\nW-well, um...
6	Tora let Rex-Rex answer that one!
7	Rex, why cloud height change?
8	Well, let's see now...
9	As you can probably see, the\nCloud Sea isn't made out of water.
10	So its surface isn't always\ncompletely flat.
11	Maybe it's easier if you compare it\nto the clouds in the sky. They come\nin all different shapes, right?
12	Some clouds very flat...\nOther clouds big and fluffy!
13	Yep, that's what I mean.
14	And the shape doesn't stay\nthe same forever.
15	The Cloud Sea is the same way.\nIt's not always a flat surface,\nsometimes it gets...fluffed up.
16	The height and shape of it isn't\nconstant.
17	It's always changing. Not suddenly,\nlike the weather, but gradually.
18	It's more likely than not\nto change overnight.
19	Yeah. That sounds about right.
20	Very interesting.
21	Oh, but it's only the Titans like this one\nand the Mor Ardain Titan that affect\nthe Cloud Sea's height.
22	Ones like the Trade Guild Titan\nGoldmouth just float on the surface,\nso they don't affect it.
23	Makes lots of sense!
24	I guess that's about the extent\nof what I know.
25	Very much thanks, Rex.\nPoppi learn a lot!
26	Rex must know lots of things.\nPoppi have even more questions to ask!
27	Uh, really? I don't know if I can\nanswer everything...
28	Poppi...
29	What me say to Poppi?
30	Should not bother Rex-Rex too much!
31	Try ask Dromarch instead!
32	Hmmm... OK then.
33	Poppi leave questions there for now.
34	Thanks, Tora.
35	I know quite a lot about the Cloud Sea\nbecause of my salvaging work, but I'm\nnot so hot on general knowledge.
36	I probably wouldn't have been\nable to answer anything else...
37	Don't worry, Rex.
38	If you don't know the answer, there's\nalways a chance that I will!
39	Thanks, Pyra.
40	And if even I don't know, we can\nstill fall back on Azurda.
41	True enough. I've been around for quite\na while, so I could most likely answer\nany questions Poppi might have.
42	And there's Dromarch as well.\nBetween us, I'm sure we could find\nan answer to most questions.
43	You're not wrong there.\nIf all of us work together, we can\nfigure out pretty much anything!
44	I guess it's not just battle where\nteamwork is important!
45	Yeah!
46	That's a good idea. I reckon Dromarch\nis more knowledgeable than I am.
47	Oh, you flatter me.\nI'm no expert compared to\nour resident Titan.
48	Wha- Don't drag me into this!
49	I have no memories of the time before\nI bonded with my lady, after all.
50	That's no reason to throw me\ninto the cooking pot!
51	What am I supposed to say if Poppi\nasks "Where do babies come from?"\nor something like that?!
52	Tell her they are delivered\nby a flying Tirkin.
53	That kind of quick thinking is why\nyou're a better man for the job.
54	Ah, you overestimate me.
55	Still, if the mighty Titan is not willing,\nI suppose we will have to rely on my\nlady instead.
56	Hoooold it, Dromarch.\nI want no part in this mess!
57	Masterpon, Poppi think Poppi\nalready learn something.
58	Learn what?
59	This what people mean when they\ntalk about "passing the buck"!
kizunatalk006_ms.json
1	We're back here...
2	This is where my whole adventure\nwith Rex really began.
3	Oh, right. This must be the spot\nwhere you and Rex washed up.
4	Though we only made it here\nthanks to Gramps's efforts.
5	And those efforts are the reason\nI'm like this now...
6	Well, if you stayed that big you\ncouldn't exactly travel with us.\nI'd say you're just right!
7	If I was my old self, I'd be able\nto carry you anywhere!
8	Well, anywhere within reason.\nThe World Tree would be pushing it.
9	Amazing!
10	So how long it take you to\nget to Argentum from here?
11	At the current separation, let's see...\nAbout ten days travel.
12	That long?!
13	"You'd do it faster than that or you'd\ntaste the whip!" is what I'm hearing.
14	Of course that's not what I mean. But\nthat's like three or four days by boat.
15	My apologies.\nI'm not as young as I used to be.
16	What is point of worrying now\nGramps not big any more?
17	True enough.\nThat old body is a thing of the past!
18	Well I think you are adorable\nlike this. I like it.
19	Well, that's very kind of you, Pyra.
20	Are you blushing, oldster?
21	Tell me, Rex. Do you ever wish\nI was in my old form?
22	Which form do I prefer?
23	I liked it better when you were big.
24	I think you're better like this.
25	Oh...\nIs that so...
26	I suppose you found me very\nuseful as a Titan.
27	Huh?
28	I provided a home...carried you from\nplace to place... Not to mention the\nsalvaging crane stuck you-know-where.
29	That's not really what I meant!
30	It's just that you were so big\nand dependable. Like a dad,\nor, well, a real grandpa.
31	Besides, I knew you in that form\nfor most of my life.
32	Everyone else only really knows you\nlike this, but I'm not used to it.
33	Rex has a point.
34	The time when I knew you before,\nAzurda, is very faint in my mind.\nThis is the Gramps I'm used to.
35	Tora cannot imagine big Gramps!
36	Poppi never seen big Gramps,\nso also cannot picture.
37	Right?\nThat's what I thought.\nIt's all about what you're used to.
38	Hmmm...\nI'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
39	Though I know you're really just\npining for the days when you could\ntravel in comfort on my back.
40	Oho...\nYou prefer me this way?
41	It's cool to have you riding on\nMY back for a change!
42	I'm not much more than a beginner\nat this whole Driver thing...
43	Just hearing you encourage me from\nbehind really sets my heart at ease.
44	And when you were big, we couldn't\njust, y'know, hang out or walk together.\nI like being able to stay close.
45	I see, I see...
46	You look rather pleased, Azurda.
47	If I were to be honest, Rex's helmet\nis a little cramped.
48	Not to mention the jolting and bumping\nand bouncing around. It's enough to\nmake me lose my lunch at times.
49	But hearing Rex say that, for the first\ntime it made me think that perhaps\nthis was actually a good thing.
50	I'm sorry about the jolting. Looks like\nI've gotta get used to this situation too.
51	That's all right, Rex. I'll keep the\nwords of encouragement coming!
52	I shall endeavor to become\never more reliable!
53	Um...
54	Actually, if you're planning on nagging\nme constantly, maybe I'll pass...
55	Yeah, I wouldn't want to have\nDromarch's nagging voice in my ear\nall the time, either...
56	Cheeky sods!
kizunatalk008_ms.json
1	I don't know what I was expecting in\nhere but this jolly well isn't it.
2	Tora surprised too!
3	Insides of World Tree make Tora's\nhead go all swirly-whirly!
4	When it's even getting to Tora,\nyou know it's serious business!
5	No need for surprise.\nMasterpon lacking in many regards.
6	In particular, common sense level\nclose to 0%.
7	Er, Poppi!\nIt go without saying, but Blade\nshould not diss Masterpon!
8	Poppi get very impudent since\nactivating QTπ mode...
9	She is difficult girl!
10	Difficult?\nDidn't you make her, though?
11	Yes, in manner of speaking, but Poppi\nis result of work of three generations.
12	Actually, there plenty in Poppi\nthat Tora not know or understand.
13	Poppi's components contain elements\nfrom Professor Soosoo and Professor\nTatazo in addition to Masterpon.
14	Poppi comprise hopes and\ndreams of all three.
15	Any one might be stronger\nat any given time!
16	You're obviously a lot more complex\nthan I gave you credit for, Popster.
17	So, hey, Tora...
18	Does that mean even you don't know\neverything she's capable of?
19	That right.
20	Basis of mode change function was\nlaid down by Grampypon Soosoo.
21	So part of system core is sealed\nmystery, or "black box".
22	What should I ask?
23	Can't you, like, investigate?
24	Are you also in the dark here, Poppi?
25	Unfortunately no. Even Dadapon not\nable to fathom what going on in there.
26	That because the box have\nnote on it saying "Do not open!"
27	The...box?
28	I thought "black box" was some kind of\nfancy engineer term or something!
29	You want to see?
30	So, the box is in Poppi's stomach or\nsomething?
31	Why don't we open it and see?
32	No way! That might activate self-\ndestruct mode of Poppi!
33	S-self-destruct?!
34	You can actually do that?
35	Of course.
36	Grampypon thought self-destruct was\nhero's most daring and noble act.
37	So...best not tamper.
38	Your Grampypon had some very\nstrange ideas, Tora.
39	Are you OK with that, Poppi?
40	Having a bloody great bomb in\nyour stomach, I mean!
41	Oh yes. No problem.
42	Bomb is comparatively safe next\nto Poppi's other functions.
43	...
44	...
45	Meh?\nWhat happen?
46	Zeke? Masterpon?
47	Why you suddenly make\nselves far from Poppi?
48	In the dark about functions?
49	Right. Sure you've not got any hidden\nabilities kicking about in there?
50	Let me see...
51	Function identified!
52	Oh, excellent! Let's see it, then!
53	Woof, woof woof woof!
54	Woof woof? Grrrr...\nWoof woof wooooof?
55	What's going on?
56	Woof woof woof woof\nDog Mode woof.
57	Poppi!\nThat mode is only for park!
58	Tora sealed Dog Mode so people\nnot think Tora some kind of weirdo!
59	Yeah...that is more than a little bit\nweird!
60	I mean come on, Tora. Why don't you\njust get a real dog?
61	Tora...not have time for real dogs...
62	Anyhow Poppi, surely that's not the\nonly ability you've got?
63	You don't have any hidden function\nwe could use for battle or exploring?\nSomething like that?
64	Even without Tora, you must be able to\ndo a bit of digging around in that black\nbox of yours, no?
65	Negative.
66	...Negative?!
kizunatalk009_ms.json
1	So... This is the abode of the mighty\nTora?
2	Hey! Careful with hands!\nLots of breakable and valuable things!
3	Huh? What's this?
4	Ah! That more than enough fiddling!\nDon't handle Tora's stuff!
5	What's this? It's all fluffy... Is this a...\nBunnit costume? Doesn't look very\nscientific...
6	That armor for Poppi!
7	Armor? It's got ears and everything.
8	This won't provide protection. It's more\nlike something from a beauty pageant.
9	This Cutie Bun-Bun Armor!
10	Cutie Bun-Bun Armor?
11	Correct! This state-of-the-art armor.\nEveryone wish they had such good\ndefense!
12	Additional function is to cheer up\nMasterpon with extreme cuteness.
13	It looks like that's\nits primary function...
14	Cheer-up effect can be boosted by\ninitiating tail-wiggle dance protocol.
15	Tora. I think you have a little explaining\nto do here.
16	Mehmeh...
17	How to defuse Brighid's anger...
18	Try to explain
19	Be defiant
20	Erm...if you listen to Tora's explanation,\nit make perfect sense!
21	I'm all ears, Tora.
22	This not thing that Tora make...\nNothing to do with Tora really...
23	This creation of Dadapon and\nGrampypon. Tora never used!
24	Is this true, Poppi?
25	Correct. This armor was designed by\nMasterpon's Grampypon.
26	Masterpon's Dadapon improve design\nfurther and perfect its defensive\ncapabilities.
27	Huh?\nIs that right?
28	That entirely right!\nTora not fib-teller!
29	Masterpon put finishing touches in\nform of tail-wiggle dance protocol.
30	Meh...
31	Masterpon work feverishly on this\nfeature.
32	Tail-wiggle protocol consume\nMasterpon's waking hours until he\nperfect wiggle angle and ear flap rate.
33	Oh, is that so?\nThat's...very interesting...Tora!
34	Poppi...Poppi...\nDon't reveal Masterpon's secrets!
35	Why not? This excellent opportunity to\nshare Masterpon's research with group.
36	Poppi's right!\nReally, this is fascinating. Do continue,\nTora!
37	I'd especially like to hear about your\nviews on women.
38	Mehmeh?!
39	Ahem!
40	This armor that Tora build based on\nDadapon and Grampypon's design!
41	This fruit of three generations of\nresearch!
42	Tora, this is indefensible!
43	Also, tail-wiggle dance protocol\ncreated entirely by Masterpon.
44	Indeed. Tora's scientific passion!
45	I don't think this has much to do with\nscientific endeavor, Tora! You can't\ndress Poppi up like this!
46	Tora, that's not cool.
47	Masterpon... Poppi not understand.
48	D-don't listen, Poppi!
49	Poppi should be proud of very special,\none-of-kind armor!
50	Tora, you should get rid of this horrible\nthing. Pyra, maybe you could just\nreduce it to ashes for us?
51	OK! I'd be happy to!
52	No! Do not destroy Tora's wonderful\ncreation!
53	Come here, Tora!\nCome here and explain yourself\nproperly!
54	No, no! Stop!\nHot! Hot! Meh!
55	It burns!

1	Amazing.\nYou get a great view of the town from\nhere, eh.
2	Told ya so. When the Zekenator says\nthere's a good view, he doesn't lie.
3	Matter of fact, it's the best\nview in all of Torigoth.
4	You're not from here, are you, Zeke?
5	You seem to know quite a lot about\nthe place.
6	Well, you see...
7	Last time I was here, the old geez at\nthe inn gave me the lowdown.
8	Oh right, you used to travel\nall over the place, didn't you?
9	Do you know a lot about other\nplaces apart from Gormott, then?
10	Oh, yes. You wouldn't believe\nsome of the things I've seen.
11	But listen, I want you to tell me\nsomething. What does this scenery\nright here make you think of?
12	How should I answer?
13	It's such a big, lively town.
14	Honestly, I think I prefer Fonsett.
15	Yeah. Hmmm. Sure.
16	But, y'know... That's just a facade.\nIt's what they want you to see.
17	A facade?
18	Yeah, exactly.
19	Like, you know Gormott's a\ncolony of Mor Ardain right now.
20	Well, the only reason the town looks\nso lively is 'cos Mor Ardain has\na military base here.
21	Most other settlements in Gormott,\neveryone's doing hard work like\nfarming and lumberjacking.
22	And most of what they produce, they\nexport to Mor Ardain.
23	It's quite a tough life here. A lot of\nfolks are struggling.
24	...
25	And it's not just Gormott, either.
26	I've seen a good few dark underbellies\non my travels, no doubt about it.
27	Did you ever try to help those people\nout?
28	Ah, so many times.
29	I had it in my head that the Zekenator\nhad the power to fix anything.
30	But...fancy sword skills and titles...\nThey aren't much use to most folks.
31	I was trying to save the world alone.\nBut what happened is that reality bit\nme on the arse.
32	Hey, don't look at it like that.
33	Huh?
34	Sure, maybe you don't have the power\nto save the whole world right now.
35	But there are definitely people\nout there you have helped.\nMe and Pyra, for a start.
36	So Zeke, don't ever give up.
37	Don't forget, you've got some people\nyou can count on now.
38	Yeah, you're right.
39	You really are.\nI dunno what I was thinking.
40	It's not just the Zekenator now. I've got\nyou guys watching my back.
41	Some of the things I couldn't do back\nthen might even be possible now.
42	Right?
43	So let's keep doing what we can.\nAll of us, together.
44	Yeah!\nI just gotta put my back into it.
45	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Look out, world! The Zekenator's\ncoming to rock your socks off!
46	Whew! That sure felt good.\nYour turn, Rex! Let your manifesto out!
47	Erm...
48	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]I'm gonna get Pyra and Mythra to\nElysium, or die trying!
49	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Yeeehaaaa!
50	What are you two DOING?!
51	You're embarrassing me...
52	Fonsett's a peaceful village, right?\nWar hasn't really reached it?
53	Yeah. That's right.
54	Problem is, most villages in\nAlrest can't say the same.
55	What do you mean exactly?
56	Listen up, chum. What you see on the\nsurface? That's not the whole story.
57	A lot of places that look like they're\ndoing well have a lot of people\nsuffering in the shadows.
58	Even here in Gormott?
59	Sure as. You can see Torigoth doing\ngreat, same as the other towns where\nthere's an Ardainian army base.
60	But most other settlements in Gormott?\nThey scrape by on hard labor like\nfarming and lumberjacking.
61	And most of what they produce, they\nexport to Mor Ardain.
62	It's quite a tough life here. A lot of\nfolks are struggling.
63	And it's not just Gormott, either.
64	I've seen a whole bunch of places like\nthis, and they make me realize how\npowerless I am.
65	...
66	Zeke, you aren't powerless.
67	You never stop wanting to help people.
68	Even now, you're thinking about the\npeople who really need your help.
69	Exactly how a future king should think.
70	Hey, don't take the piss.
71	I mean it.
72	I'm all spent just worrying about\nthe people right in front of me.
73	Pyra, Mythra, Nia, Gramps...
74	But it seems like you're always\nworrying about the wider world.
75	Like, people whose names you don't\neven know.
76	It's something I really admire about\nyou, Zeke. I hope I can learn to care as\nmuch as you do.
77	Man, you always know what to say.\nYou're such a...focused guy.
78	Haha. Gramps said I should pay\nmore attention to the world\naround me, though.
79	Tell you what then, chum.
80	While you focus on your main\ngoals, I'll keep an eye on the\nbig picture for you.
81	Yeah. I know I can count on you.
82	Damn right you can!
83	Oh, what a pair.
84	I find it really inspiring.
85	Yeah, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a\nlittle inspired.

1	The inside of a Titan battleship is way\ndifferent from the Monoceros, huh...
2	What is Monoceros?
3	Rex, you saw it, right? Moored at a pier\nback in Goldmouth?
4	Jin and co.'s black boat.
5	Aah, that really impressive one!\nIt runs without being hooked up to\na Titan, right?
6	I'm no expert, but...\nyeah, looked like it.
7	Sound awesome!\nTora want to see too!
8	You won't get the chance, unless we\nsee those Torna guys again.
9	Meh-meh-meh-meh?!
10	Tora change mind. No need to see.
11	Masterpon change mind\nat drop of hat...
12	Well, the Monoceros was pretty sweet,\nbut this is nothing to scoff at either!
13	For sure.\nIt's full of things I've never seen before.
14	Ah!\nThat's because this vessel is result of\nlatest breakthroughs in Ardainian tech!
15	Regular folk never so much as set foot\non board!
16	You say breakthroughs in technology,\nbut what you mean is salvaged stuff,\nright?
17	Hmm, not exclusively. I see lots of\nhomegrown improvements as well.
18	Like this, see? Whatever they've stuffed\nin here, it's been messed with so much,\nI can't tell what it was to start with.
19	That control panel. It transmit signal\nto Titan nerves.
20	By running cables to different parts of\nTitan from here, can control signal flow\nmuch more better.
21	Whaaaat...?\nThat's amazing.
22	And this cable itself have 2.4 time the\nspeed and 12 time the capacity of\nprevious iteration.
23	In other words, it on whole other level\nto stuff other countries use!
24	Huh! So if they put this in a smaller\nTitan vessel, it would work even better!
25	Pin-pon! Correct!
26	*sigh* They seem to be having fun,\nbut it's all gibberish to me...
27	Poppi, what do you think?
28	What should Poppi say?
29	That not even so bad...
30	Why Masterpon act so proud?
31	Oh really?
32	Poppi have access to much\nvaried information.
33	Considering interests of Masterpon,\ntechnology info is especially rich.
34	So for Poppi is not issue,\nfollowing conversation in question.
35	Moreover, if necessary, Poppi could\nout-geek Masterpon if Poppi try.
36	R-right, OK...
37	I'm...sorry I doubted you...
38	No worry, Nia.
39	Poppi can also hold conversation on\nfavorite bug dishes of Nia.
40	You're too kind...
41	I should point out though, it's not bugs\nI like, but fish.
42	Meh-?!\nPoppi apologize.
43	Poppi update her database now.\nMasterpon not always fastidious in\ndata entry, so mistakes happen.
44	Tora!\nI like bugs now, do I...?
45	Meh-meh!\nTora suddenly feel very unsafe.
46	Rex-Rex, we should move on.\nIf we stay here, something bad\nbound to happen!
47	Like what?
48	No time to waste, we go!
49	Ho-hoo!\nTora very glad you ask!
50	That because tech used in this Titan\nbattleship is same as what Poppi's\nmuscles and drivetrain use!
51	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Poppi is surprised!
52	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]But however though!\nOnes that Poppi use are even more\nimproved than these here!
53	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Yet more surprise!
54	...Are you saying you stole the tech\nfrom Mor Ardain?
55	C'mon, Tora...\nIs that what you call sporting behavior?
56	Tora take calculated risk in service to\ncause of scientific advancement...
57	As result, not even Ardainian\nscientists capable of reverse-engineer\nPoppi systems!
58	So no worries there!
59	Upon learning secret of Poppi's birth,\nPoppi feel sense of unease...
60	E-everything fine!\n...Probably.
61	Now, Rex-Rex! No time for chit-chat.\nLet's get going!
kizunatalk013_ms.json
1	Outstanding!
2	It thanks to Tora becoming Driver that\nTora come to this place!
3	Blades and Drivers most best ever!
4	That remind Tora!
5	Rex-Rex, Nia!\nTora need little consultation.
6	Uh, a consultation? With us?
7	Tora have big problem right now.
8	Recently...Tora finally realized.
9	Tora is...
10	Tora is...?
11	Tora is not very useful in battle!
12	...
13	...
14	Why friends silent?
15	Oh, uh... We're just a bit surprised.
16	I mean, I just never really took you for\nthe self-assessing type.
17	Too cruel!
18	Nah, I mean, you fight just fine, Tora.
19	...Poppi deserve all the credit.
20	She pass weapon and do all the things\nso Tora can fight like real Driver.
21	Tora sometimes think, if he remove\nprogram of Poppi, Poppi fighting\nalone would be most efficient...
22	Seriously...?\nWow, you go girl.
23	That why Tora just feel like\nsmall furry ball and chain!
24	Well, er...I wouldn't go that far...
25	Anyway, Tora wonder if there any\npoint to Tora still being Driver...
26	Maybe it better for everyone if Tora\nretire and assume supervisor duty\non sideline...?
27	Oh, Tora...
28	Nia, what do you think?
29	What shall I ask Tora?
30	Why did you want to be a Driver?
31	What's the most important thing,\nfor a Driver?
32	It not clear to Tora anymore...
33	Starting with Grampypon, dearest\nwish of family was to successfully\ncreate artificial Blade.
34	So it natural that Tora start to wish\nit too.
35	Well, do you know why your grandad\nwanted to make an artificial Blade?
36	Surely it because...
37	He want to be famous!
38	That sounds like a lame reason...
39	But Nopon Driver is rare thing!
40	Nopon who become Driver\nalmost sure to become celebrity!
41	Was that your motivation as well then?
42	Mmmehhhh...\nNot exactly.
43	Tora want to be like Rex-Rex!
44	Like me?
45	At first, Tora simply yearn to be Driver,\nnot think too much about it.
46	But after me travel with Rex-Rex and\nfriends, he start to think different!
47	Saving persons in need,\nfacing all challenges...
48	Rex-Rex is Tora's idea of perfect\nDriver!
49	It...feels kinda strange when you say\nthat to my face...
50	Rex, a perfect Driver? I'm not\nconvinced. But it looks like you've\ngot a clear goal in mind, Tora.
51	Hey, hold on...
52	Honestly, that's all you need! Tora,\nyou should keep being a Driver.
53	As long as you have goals to achieve,\nthere's no reason for you to stop.
54	And your Blade will help you in that.
55	Poppi shouldn't have to fight alone.\nYou need to be right there with her.
56	It fair point...
57	Thank you, Rex-Rex!\nThank you, Nia!
58	Tora promise he will strive to be best\nDriver ever!
59	Tora been thinking about that a lot...
60	Love towards Blade is important!
61	...L-love?
62	Not an answer I was expecting...
63	Tora observe and Tora analyze...
64	And Tora note, all Drivers have\nlove for their Blades!
65	Example! Rex-Rex love Pyra,\nand Nia love Dromarch!
66	I love Pyra?!
67	R-Rex loves Pyra?!
68	Love that Tora feel for Poppi is also\nunsurpassed thing.
69	But just because Tora have love,\nnot mean Tora can necessarily be\nDriver...
70	Yeah, but still...
71	Hang on, Rex.
72	We're getting bogged down here.\nCan we just straight up ask Poppi\nand be done with this?
73	That's a great idea.\nLet's get Poppi here.
74	Hey, Poppi.\nWhat would you do if Tora said\nhe wanted to quit being a Driver?
75	Poppi probably break down in tears,\nis what!
76	Meh-meh-meh-meh!\nTora work to be best Driver he can!
77	Well that was pretty easy...
78	*sigh* I've just got no patience for\nthis sorta non-problem.

1	This looks like as good a place\nas any to have a proper chat.
2	So, what did you want to discuss?
3	Well, listen, Mòrag...\nWhat do you think of me?
4	Forgive me, Pandoria, but I'm not\nsure I understand the question.
5	Well, um, I was wondering...\nDo you think I'm feminine enough?
6	How should I respond?
7	I think you're perfectly fine.
8	Are you coming on to me?
9	Relax. You're a very lovely\nyoung woman.
10	Well I mean, I'm sure most women\nlook feminine and cute next to you,\nMòrag, but...
11	Are you trying to insult me?
12	N-no, not at all!\nSorry, I'm not good with words...
13	...Hmph.
14	But, don't you think I'm kind of plain\nnext to Pyra and Brighid?
15	It's true that the two of them do have\na certain healthy vigor about them.
16	Right?
17	Sometimes I feel like I need to up my\ngame a bit when it comes to looks.
18	I see.
19	And you thought I must know all the\ntips and tricks to keep one's\nappearance in tip-top shape.
20	No, no, I wouldn't come to\nyou for that kind of advice!
21	It's just...you dress like a guy, right?
22	...Oh.
23	So, I figured you probably have\na good idea of how men think.
24	...Hahahah.\nI see.
25	Yeah, I knew you'd understand!
26	So tell me, from your point of view,\nwhat have Brighid and Pyra\ngot that I haven't?
27	Forget it!\nWe're done here!
28	Huh?!\nWait a sec, Mòrag!
29	Weren't you gonna help me?!\nOh, c'mon, you're such a tease!
30	If this is a come-on, I'm very flattered...
31	But...you know I'm a woman,\nright, Pandoria?
32	I must admit that I didn't\ntake you for, uh, well...
33	*giggle*\nOh, Mòrag, you're so funny.
34	Huh?
35	That's not it at all!
36	I wasn't confessing my love or\nanything. I just wanted to ask\nyou about my femininity.
37	Really? You came to ask\nme about femininity?
38	You dress like a dude but you're so\npretty. You must know a thing or two.
39	Your hair, your skin, your nails...\nAlways so on point.
40	You have better eyes than\nI gave you credit for.
41	I just notice that stuff. I'm a\ngirl Blade, after all.
42	I see...
43	Sounds like there's some man that\nyou want to notice you, Pandoria.
44	No no no! Nothing like that!
45	I was just watching you and Brighid,\nand wondered what kind of stuff\nyou do to look so sophisticated.
46	Is that so?
47	No word of a lie!
48	Heh.
49	Both Brighid and myself import\nElastifying Tonic and Freshening\nGel specially from Argentum.
50	Mm hmm.
51	Titan-Oil Hand Cream also\ncomes in very useful.
52	I see, I see.
53	I'll ask Zeke if he can buy\nsome for you too, in future.
54	What?! No, don't do that!
55	Oh...?
56	Let's keep this on the down-low, OK?
57	Nobody needs to know!

1	I made tea for everyone.\nHelp yourselves!
2	Oh no. Pyra getting it\ncompletely wrong...
3	Oh, would you rather have\nsomething else, Tora?
4	Oh, no no, that not it. Tora just\nthink that if Pyra going to do maid\njob, Pyra should be more...maidy.
5	...Maidy?
6	Tora.\nPyra was kind enough to make tea.\nCan't you just be bloody grateful?
7	Oh, Tora know that, but, also...\nStrive for perfection is important goal!\nTora feel very strongly about this!
8	Most important thing for maid is...um...\nNopon word is, uh..."blushy-crushy".
9	Pyra still quite lacking in that area!
10	I...I'm lacking...?!
11	But what on Alrest is "blushy-crushy"?
12	It, uh...what every man looking for.
13	If Pyra master art of blushy-crushy,\nthen all men fall at Pyra's feet!
14	A-all men? Really?
15	Yes! It is known fact!
16	Listen, Pyra. There's no point paying\nattention to this little twerp.
17	But...
18	Is Pyra interested in\nessence of maidiness?
19	A-am I interested?
20	Yes I am!
21	If you think Rex would like that...
22	You cannot be serious.
23	Good attitude! Tora will teach\nmaid art of blushy-crushy.
24	Welcome Tora's maidiest assistant!
25	How may I be of service, Masterpon?\nTee-hee!
26	P-Poppi?
27	What the hell happened to you?\nIs this some kinda malfunction?
28	Poppi's Maidiest Mode has been\nactivated. Tee-hee!
29	Maidiest Poppi will teach you all\nabout essence of maid behavior.
30	Blushy-crushy is external magnification\nof love feelings inside heart.
31	Poppi will teach magic way to magnify\nlove feelings. Chant with Poppi.
32	O-OK!
33	Cutey-cutey, lovely-lovely,\nblushy-crushy tee-hee!
34	Pyra, please do NOT\ntell me you're gonna...
35	C-cutey-cutey? Lovely...lovely...\nBlushy...crushy...tee-hee!
36	Whelp, there we go.
37	Not quite!\nCopy Poppi exactly!
38	Yes, coach!
39	Please, Pyra... Come back to us...\nWhile you still can!
40	Rex-Rex is boy, so he definitely\nnot immune to the charms of\nblushy-crushy.
41	It definitely worth Pyra's time\nto learn essence of maidiness.
42	I see...
43	OK, I'm ready!\nTora, tell me what to do!
44	Uh, Pyra?
45	Tora will now introduce\nassistant to help teach\nessence of maidiness!
46	How may I be of service, Mr. Rex, sir?\nTee-hee!
47	P-Poppi?
48	What is this, Tora,\nsome kinda malfunction?
49	Do not worry. This just "Rex-Focused\nBlushy-Crushy Maximization Mode".
50	Have a good day salvaging, Mr. Rex, sir!\nTee-hee-hee!
51	Mr. Rex...sir??
52	S-so this is "blushy-crushy"...?
53	OK, Pyra, copy what Poppi say.
54	Mr. Rex sir,\nPoppi is blushy-crushy just for you.
55	Mr. Rex...sir...\nPyra is...blushy-crushy...\njust for you?
56	No no no, no!\nRex-Rex will never fall at Pyra's feet\nwith such low level of blushy-crushy!
57	Try again from top!
58	Mr. Rex! Sir!\nPyra is blushy-crushy! Just for you!
59	Not there yet!
60	I...I give up.\nI can't watch this any more.

1	There's a really great view of the\nwhole village from here, right?
2	Indeed! It's quite the vista.
3	Such a fine village it is, too...
4	Certainly no one is awash with luxury\ndown there. But still, the people are\nremarkably happy.
5	Even when life is hard, they keep\nsmiling, keep looking forward.
6	I think of it as the continuation of\nVandham's spirit. He may be gone, but\nhis good deeds outlive him.
7	Yes, it's a fine thought, knowing\nthe man who built and protected\nthis village was once my Driver.
8	What should I say...?
9	Do you want to hear about Vandham?
10	Do you wish you could stay here?
11	Well... It seems a tad rude to\ngo on about my old Driver in\nfront of my current one.
12	But I've heard he was quite\nthe remarkable man.\nNaturally, I'm curious.
13	He was one of the good guys, all right.
14	He had big muscles, a big voice,\nand an even bigger heart.
15	It was Vandham who taught me\nthe basics of being a Driver.
16	More than that, in fact...
17	He taught me all about Blades, how to\nfight, the way of the world...
18	I didn't know him for long, but he\ntaught me the most important things I\nknow.
19	Is that right...
20	He was the kind of solid, powerful\nand dashing sort that is irresistible\nto the opposite sex, I'll wager.
21	Erm, I'm not sure if he was that\nmuch of a hit with the ladies.\nBut he was a great guy, that's for sure.
22	Hmmm. I feel the loss of my memories\nof him very keenly.
23	Well, don't worry, Roc.
24	Like I said before.
25	The people of this village are carrying\non what he started. And so are we.
26	I hope I can become as good as him\nsome day. I may still have a way to go...
27	But just you stick with me, Roc,\nand one day, you'll see!
28	I don't doubt it.
29	I promise to hold you to the same high\nstandards, Rex.
30	I wouldn't say that.
31	After all, it's not like I have any\nmemories of my time in this village.
32	But I believe something lives on here.\nSomething of Vandham, and of myself.
33	When I think about it, I can't help\nbut get a tad sentimental.
34	Yeah, I know what you mean.
35	It's like the village is full of memories...\nMemories of you, memories of\nVandham.
36	I wonder how he and I used to spend\nour days...
37	I think...you probably both lived\npretty normal lives, really.
38	Normal?
39	That's right. Vandham was the\neveryday sort, you know?
40	I mean, he'd get up in the morning, see\nto the kids, then he'd just eat a big\nsausage sandwich.
41	Evenings, he'd drink a beer and chat\nabout what he was up to. Then he'd\njust get a bit sleepy, and go to bed.
42	I think that's what he was trying to\nbuild here. A place where people\ncould just...live normal lives.
43	I think that's what both of you\nwere always fighting for.
44	Fighting for a normal life...?
45	Then perhaps even now, that\nnormal life is what the people\nof this village hold most dear.
46	Tell me, Rex... Would you say\nVandham was a kind person?
47	Kind, huh...?
48	I mean, he was straight up with\neveryone. Maybe even blunt sometimes.
49	But he was a real gentle giant.
50	He'd probably get mad at me\nfor saying it, but I think he was\na lot like a father.
51	He's someone that I looked up to.\nSomeone I'd like to be like someday.
52	I can see you hold him in great\nregard, Rex. I only wish I could\nhave met him myself.
53	He did everything he could to protect\nus. I bet he's still watching over us\nfrom somewhere, even now...
54	Well. In that case, I'd better make\nsure he always sees me at my best!
55	Yeah... I reckon if we don't live\nup to his expectations, we'll be\nin for a right rollicking someday!

1	Mòrag... Is Ardainian army still\ndigging up Aeshma?
2	No... I believe the excavation has been\nput on hold ever since the incident.
3	Still many Ardainians here though...
4	Why not go home to Empire?
5	If we were to leave the site unguarded,\nTorna could misuse the artifacts again.
6	Even if we were to re-bury what has\nbeen excavated so far, there's no\nguarantee the same won't happen.
7	So we're maintaining jurisdiction\nover the site for the time being.
8	To ensure they don't fall into the wrong\nhands, we've bolstered the garrison and\nbrought in a Titan battleship too.
9	Makes much sense.
10	Tora want to check out Aeshma!
11	Never seen weapons from Judicium\nbefore. Very interesting technology.
12	My apologies, Tora.
13	Our treaty with the Kingdom of Uraya\nwill not allow it.
14	We have agreed not to investigate,\nresearch or use Aeshma in any form.
15	Meh-meh!
16	But when you making such promise?!
17	At the Mor Ardain-Uraya summit.
18	Mor Ardain take big penalty\nfor almost starting war?
19	That's about right, yes.
20	What Tora ask?
21	You pay Uraya big fine too?
22	You give Uraya Tasty Sausages?
23	You make other promises?
24	We didn't end up paying monetary\ncompensation, but it was a possibility.
25	If we had, it would likely have come to\naround 40 billion G.
26	Much expensive!
27	Could make 1,000 Poppis\nwith that money.
28	Wow, you're surprisingly expensive too.
29	Eheheh!
30	If not money, what did Mòrag\ncountry pay?
31	That just what Masterpon would want.
32	If you pay in sausages, how\nmany years supply it take?
33	Hmmm...
34	About a billion years' worth,\nI suppose.
35	You just made up a large number\nbecause you couldn't be bothered\nto calculate, didn't you?
36	What did Mòrag country pay then?
37	Very sharp, Tora.
38	Must have been forced to hand over\nall Mor Ardain technologies!
39	That would be unreasonably harsh...\nNo, it was a different request.
40	Masterpon not so sharp after all.
41	Meh-meh-meh...
42	They asked for the rights to survey\nTemperantia.
43	Why they want that?
44	Well, as a buffer zone. But we managed\nto dig up that Judician Titan weapon,\ndidn't we?
45	Perhaps they thought Temperantia\nwould still have other such weapons\nburied within it.
46	Uraya would love to get hold of\nsome of this ordnance.
47	Surely, it would be an\nawesome deterrent.
48	Yes... And, a protection for the nation.
49	Ahhh, such boring geopolitics.
50	Tora not care about any of that.\nJust want to tinker with Titan weapon\nfreely on his own.
51	Haha... I'm sure you do.
52	If only we and Uraya were as\nsimple to deal with as you, Tora.
53	Indeed. I envy you that\nsimplicity of mind.
54	Masterpon.\nThey calling you simple idiot.
55	Tora never hear word idiot!
56	Hmph. Now Tora go steal advanced\nJudicium tech and use to upgrade\nPoppi's respect for Masterpon.
57	Don't do that. Please.

1	Ladies and gentlepon, thank you for\njoin us here today!
2	We hope you enjoy performance of\n"Uraya Goes To War".
3	This is gonna be so much fun!
4	Are we the only ones watching?\nWhere did Nia go off to?
5	I dunno...
6	Queen Raqura! Me think time has come\nto go to war with Mor Ardain!
7	This is most sudden, War Minister.
8	My lady...
9	Wow, you're great, Nia!
10	Shut it, you!\nI didn't ask to take part in this farce!
11	Ahem. This not sudden, Your Majesty.
12	We preparing for war ever since\nMor Ardain take occupation of Gormott.
13	Then the preparations are complete?
14	Preparations go steady for long time,\nbut we can quickly make complete.
15	Mor Ardain soon try to conquer other\ncountries aside from Gormott.
16	We can not allow ambitions to succeed.\nMust start war at earliest possibility!
17	I see...
18	So be it, then.\nLet us make war.
19	Wait one moment please!
20	You have concerns, High Minister?
21	Titan of Mor Ardain quickly becoming\nso barren, crops can not be grown.
22	Meanwhile we have rich soil, producing\nmuch delicious Gromrice.
23	Why bother with war when Mor Ardain\ncollapse on its own from famine?
24	A valid question.
25	No, no. If we wait, Mor Ardain just\nconquer more territories like Gormott.
26	With more territories, Mor Ardain\nbecome still greater threat!
27	Even if Mor Ardain Titan collapse\ncompletely, may still be difficult to\ndefeat whole Empire!
28	There no need to be hasty.
29	Mor Ardain still not have enough\nterritory or supplies to properly\nprovide for own people.
30	Gormott alone not enough to support\nwhole of Ardainian population.
31	In other words, more prudent to\nwait for Mor Ardain to grow weaker\nbefore attacking.
32	Your argument is compelling.
33	That not happen today or tomorrow\nthough!
34	No! Might take many decades to\nhappen, or even centuries!
35	We can not allow Mor Ardain threat\nto remain longer than necessary!
36	That quite true, but now is\nnot time to rush into things!
37	War preparations may be in progress,\nbut still not in optimal condition!
38	This argument never end.\nYour Majesty must make final decision!
39	Huh? You want me to decide?
40	Your Majesty is Queen of Uraya.
41	Oh...yeah, right...
42	What should I say?
43	Let's go to war!
44	Let's wait a little longer.
45	...
46	...
47	What now?\nDid you both forget your lines?
48	Script of "Uraya Goes To War"\nend here. No more lines to say.
49	Thank you for coming today, everyone!
50	I see, I see...
51	By showing this play to the children,\nyou'll get them to think for themselves\nabout whether Uraya should go to war.
52	That's quite clever, actually.
53	It's a difficult question. I can see the\nkids having split opinions, too.
54	You force me to take part in this thing\nand then it just ends like that?!
55	This is SO not satisfying!

1	Rex-Rex! Tora have to ask for friend,\nas fellow man's man!
2	Tora want to gain understanding\nof life as adventurer!
3	As an adventurer?
4	Rex-Rex is role-model of Tora!\nThat why Tora want to learn everything\nhe can about being Rex-Rex!
5	This is all very sudden, Tora.\nWhat's going on?
6	Come now, Rex.\nDon't feel too important,\nhe just wants to talk.
7	In any case, it not so common for\nMasterpon to ask something so directly.
8	Exactly! Tora being earnest like\nnever before! Hm!
9	Tora submit as evidence: this direct,\nunflinching eye contact!
10	Wow, your pupils are really dilated...
11	That's what you get, staying up all\nnight...
12	All right, tonight Masterpon\ngo to bed early.
13	Meh-meh-meh-meh! Enough!\nTora's eyes are worry of Tora!\nIt not matter!
14	This important!\nTora want to be like Rex-Rex!
15	Rex-Rex! Please, teach Tora!
16	How do I answer?
17	I'll teach you all that life's taught me!
18	Maybe it's better if Nia teaches you?
19	Thank you!\nTora cannot wait!
20	All right, Tora, listen up.\nTo become a responsible adult, here's\nwhat you need to do.
21	Firstly, you've got to take good care\nof your tools!
22	Ah, Tora very good at that! Runs\nPoppi's diagnostics every day!
23	Indeed, Masterpon keep Poppi in\nimpeccable state of maintenance.
24	Secondly, you've got to take good care\nof your friends!
25	If you don't have friends to rely on,\nyou'll be in trouble when a big job\ncomes around!
26	Hum hum hum, Tora see...
27	Tora always work alone until now,\nso that point still a little new to Tora.
28	And most importantly, number three!
29	Yes, yes?
30	Correctly triangulating wreckage\ncoordinates!
31	Ah, of course!\nTora can see that very important!
32	...One moment. Wreckage coordinates?
33	That's right.
34	If you mess up the coordinates, all the\nprep you've done goes down the drain.
35	You might lose out on any loot\nyou could've got otherwise...
36	...\n...
37	Um, Rex. Isn't that salvaging you're\ntalking about...?
38	Uh?\nYeah, why?
39	One moment please.\nWhy Rex-Rex talking about salvaging?
40	You wanted to know about adventure,\nyeah? And what greater adventure\nis there than salvaging?
41	Tora want to know Driver wisdom!\nHave no use for salvager wisdom! Meh!
42	Whuh?
43	Masterpon, it seem that ask\nRex about art of being Driver\nnot bear fruit.
44	After all, Rex is a rookie too...
45	...Tora is disappoint.
46	I really thought you were thinking\nof being a salvager, Tora...
47	...Meh. It fine.\nTora ask Nia.
48	H-hang on, Tora!
49	Let me...\nLet me try again!
50	OK, so you want to know\nabout being a Driver, right?
51	Right!
52	Does it bother Masterpon when\nsomeone say he no good at weapon\npass?
53	Of course it bother Tora!
54	I mean, weapon pass is crucial\nelement of Driver-Blade coordination...
55	If someone say me not so great at that,\nTora's self-esteem plunge is\npar for course!
56	I know where you're coming from, but...
57	Uh, maybe that's all the more reason\nto ask Nia? She's the experienced one\naround here...
58	Mehhh... Tora get it.\nWill ask and come back...
59	Nia just say, with time, body of Driver\nlearn to do it by muscle memory...
60	Answer seem somewhat...dismissive...?
61	Ah, that's a shame...
62	Hey, but, maybe I can still help?
63	I think Pyra and I manage OK, so...
64	Actually, Nia refer to Rex-Rex as well.
65	Poppi believe "the kid's green as\nfreshly mowed grass himself"...\nwere her exact words.
66	
67	Seriously?!
68	That's what she thinks of me...?
69	Chin up, Rex-Rex.
70	Indeed!\nHave much time to live and learn!
71	Yeah! We'll get there!
72	He says he'll help, but then he's the\none who needs pepping up...

1	When I look at it now, this capital of\nyours is pretty prosperous.
2	Far cry from Gormott.
3	...Is that how you see it, Nia?
4	Well, am I wrong?
5	Your technology is so much more\nadvanced than Gormott's, and you've\ngot army facilities, hot springs...
6	Looks to me like you've got all you\nneed right here. I guess I don't get why\nyou had to go and annex Gormott...
7	...Mor Ardain generally has a rather\nhot climate, you see.
8	We developed by actively exploiting\ntechnology which uses the heat, as well\nas that we obtained through salvage.
9	But as the Titan nears the end of its\nlifetime, the temperature has started\nrising steadily.
10	Ironically, while this has made our\nheat-powered technologies even more\nefficient...
11	Our farmland has done very much\nthe opposite of flourish.
12	The Titan's lifetime, huh...
13	Yes, it shouldn't be long now.\nThe day when Mor Ardain's Titan\nbecomes uninhabitable.
14	Sensing that, the Senate started a war\nto conquer a new home for our people.
15	...That'd be Gormott, then.
16	...Indeed.
17	What do I say to that?
18	You realize there was a better way?
19	All this because of dumb pride...
20	...Was there, now?
21	Our two governments could've just\ntalked, got to know each other,\nbecome friends...
22	We could've worked together on this!
23	Just like you and me. We were enemies\nat first, sure, but now we're allies,\nfighting on the same side.
24	If our nations could've done the same,\nit wouldn't have had to come to war.
25	...Perhaps so.
26	If everyone in this world thought like\nyou do, terror and strife wouldn't be\nso commonplace.
27	Well, come on... You're not just gonna\ngive up, are you?
28	What do you mean?
29	If there's no need for strife, then\nwe should just get rid of it.
30	Rex told us, right?\nIf we reach the World Tree, there'll\nbe no need for fighting any more.
31	You think Elysium is the answer to all\nour troubles, do you?
32	I don't care if people laugh, call it\na pipe dream, or whatever...
33	I'd rather be an optimist than just\ndespair at the state of the world.
34	Haha... You have a point.
35	I hope you'll lend us your strength to\nreach that goal, Mòrag. It'd be grand\nif we could count on your support.
36	I will. They call me the Empire's finest,\nand I intend to prove it.
37	What do you mean?
38	You didn't have to act so high and\nmighty. You coulda been humble.
39	But no. I dunno if you were refusing to\nshow weakness, or if you just felt you\nwere better than us...
40	But you put your damn pride above\nall other things and chose to invade.\nAm I wrong?
41	You started a war. Wanting to save\nlives, you ended up losing lives.\nHow backwards is that?
42	If you can't make enough food...
43	why not just...bow your head and ask\nif you could share?
44	I mean, we were enemies once, but\nnow we understand each other...
45	How could a sodding government\nnot even think of it?
46	A point well made...\nBut the world is not as straightforward\na place as that.
47	Sometimes the most obvious way\nis the most difficult to take.
48	Cor... People are such a pain...
49	No question...
50	That's exactly why I want to support\nthe boy, and other upright people\nlike him.
51	You mean Rex?
52	A world with no strife...\nCan you imagine something so\nwonderful, if it were true?
53	And if there's anyone who could ever\nmake it true, it's him.
54	Every age needs its own dreamers\nto forge new paths, after all.
55	Hah... You're full of surprises, Mòrag.\nYou always struck me as straight-laced.
56	But here you are, believing in the\nElysium story.
57	It's not just little boys and girls that\nfollow their dreams, is it?
58	I too want to see the fruits of this\ndream you all share. That's why I'm\nwith you.
59	Well, whatever your motive,\nit's nice to have you with us, Mòrag.
60	Yeah, I think we can make good use\nof the Empire's finest!
61	Please do.
62	No matter what path we tread,\nI'll be there to help you on the way...
kizunatalk024_ms.json
1	Hey, Gramps... You were protecting\nthis place for years and years, right?
2	That I was.\nFive hundred of them, in fact.
3	But all that time I was a kid in Fonsett,\nI never noticed you doing anything\nlike that.
4	Well, things have been quiet for the\npast few centuries.
5	Given two hundred years or so,\nrumors pass into legend, and people\nstop taking them so seriously.
6	Long ago, Drivers used to enter this\nplace quite often, but their numbers\nhave long since fallen off.
7	Besides, the entrance itself will not\nopen for any but a Leftherian.
8	And sad though it may be, the\npopulation of Fonsett is on the decline.
9	Fewer and fewer people are even\naware of this place.
10	I see...
11	So you actually had work to do\nback in the day, huh?
12	I'm no layabout now, either!\nI was the one who told you of\nthis place, if you recall!
13	Sure, whatevs.
14	Honestly, Nia, you're just like Corinne\nwhen she was younger.
15	Huh?! Really?!
16	I'm not sure if that's a compliment...
17	She was quite the little firecracker.\nEven came in here once, as a child.
18	Wow, pretty gutsy.
19	Though she turned back upon reaching\nthe bridge. She must have sensed that\nthis was a place to be feared.
20	It's protected by the village's guardian\nspirit after all. Anyone in Fonsett would\nknow it's not a place to enter lightly.
21	To fear and to respect are two sides\nof the same coin, you know.
22	The people of Fonsett understand\nthe importance of this place on an\ninstinctive level.
23	What do I say to that?
24	Only thanks to you, Gramps.
25	How would outsiders feel about it?
26	You've been protecting this place\nfor centuries, right?
27	I think it's probably thanks to you\nthat the villagers have such a powerful\nrespect for the Village Guardian.
28	Yeah, you can't have respect without\nsomeone to keep it alive.
29	If it were not for the Titan Azurda,\nthis place may truly have been\nforgotten by the world completely.
30	Well, I don't think anyone's put\nit to me quite like that before.
31	You've done good,\nthese past 500 years.
32	Yeah. Good job, Gramps.
33	...
34	More than anything,\nat times like this...
35	I just feel thankful that I'm able to\ntravel with you all in this form.
36	If I'd remained in my old body,\nI might never have come here\nand heard those words!
37	I thought you were gonna say\nsomething profound, not just\nbask in the praise!
38	Hohohoh!
39	People from outside of Fonsett village?
40	None have entered in recent years, but\n400 years ago, visitors did sometimes\nventure in here with Fonsett youths.
41	It seems people from outside see\nthis place as little more than another\nruin to be explored.
42	I tried to talk them out of entering,\nbut they never appreciated my words.
43	Still, I didn't feel it was right to\nstop them by force.
44	They stood precious little chance of\nreaching the end, at any rate.
45	Thus it was that many adventurers\nentered, never to return.
46	I daresay their sacrifice also\ncontributed to the healthy respect\nthe villagers now hold for this place.
47	Yeah, you don't treat a ruin lightly\nwhen folks go in and never come out.
48	I don't doubt that that is indeed\na part of it.
49	You've been watching for 500 years\nas all this stuff happened, right?
50	I guess that must've been tough going.
51	Sorry for being all disrespectful\nand stuff before.
52	No need to apologize, Nia.
53	We are all quite used to your\nfoul mouth at this point.
54	And we know you have a\nkind heart underneath.
55	Urghh...
56	I wanna make a snappy comeback,\nbut that would ruin my apology!

1	...
2	So there you are, Mòrag.
3	...Is something wrong?
4	No, not at all.\nI've just been thinking.
5	...Any particular worries?
6	Ah, it's just...\nMy brother.
7	Emperor Niall? Is he OK?
8	I'm...concerned he'll wear himself out.
9	The Emperor is quite young, isn't he...
10	Yes. The weight of responsibility\nis a heavy burden for someone his age...
11	Have you two spoken recently?
12	Well, as Special Inquisitor, I send him\nreports almost daily...
13	No, I mean, just...\ntalk, like siblings do.
14	Chat about family stuff, things like that.
15	Talk like siblings do...?
16	It may shock you, but neither me nor\nthe Emperor are great at small talk.
17	Don't overthink it.
18	You can talk about anything,\nso long as it's not work.
19	You should just go drop in.
20	Ah, the Emperor is a very busy person...
21	Engaging in idle chit-chat with me...\nThat would be a waste of his time.
22	How do I respond?
23	Surely he'd be happy to see his big sis.
24	Sounds like you don't want to see him...
25	Surely even the great Emperor Niall\nwould be happy to see his big sis!
26	...Thank you, Pyra.
27	Alas, my brother and I are\nhardly your average family.
28	His Imperial Majesty and his retainer,\nthe Special Inquisitor...
29	Our stations differ greatly,\nas do our ways of life.
30	We couldn't possibly expect to talk\nlike normal siblings...
31	Oh, give me a break!\nYou think your "stations" trump your\nrelationship as brother and sister?
32	Mythra?! When did you-
33	I couldn't listen to you anymore.
34	You're family, aren't you?\nYou and Emperor Niall.
35	Emperor or not, he's your brother,\nfirst and foremost.
36	What more is there to think about?
37	...Even so...\nIt has been a long time since we've\nacted as siblings...
38	Look at me and Pyra. We haven't\nexactly been in touch all that much.
39	And now? We're rock-solid.
40	That's not exactly...
41	Shut it!
42	You being worried about your brother\nmakes you family enough.
43	Your stations don't come into it!
44	Just woman up and be\na good sister already!
45	M-mhm...
46	Maybe you're right...
47	Of course I'm right. Obviously.
48	Just enjoy some time with your little\nbro and spoil him rotten. That's it.
49	...Very well. Then I will strive to be\nthe sister Niall deserves.
50	You better be ready the next time you\ntwo meet.
51	I will...\nI promise.
52	Finally, we've made some progress.
53	You and Rex both get so stuck in your\nheads, it's infuriating.
54	Ha...\nThanks for the pep talk, Mythra.
55	You're very welcome.
56	Hang on. Mòrag, could it be that\nyou don't want to see him?
57	No, that's not it.
58	I would like to spend time with him,\nno question.
59	But I'm afraid our respective stations\nwould get in the way...
60	Stations...?\nYou mean because he's Emperor?
61	Indeed.
62	When my little brother took the throne,\nI volunteered to become his shield.
63	It was then that we cut the\nfamilial bonds between us.
64	You poor thing...
65	Please don't misunderstand.\nI do not regret choosing this life.
66	To protect my brother, and all of\nMor Ardain... There is no higher joy\nfor me.
67	...
68	...As a Blade, I have no family.\nBut I do long for the kind of relations\nthat a family brings.
69	You and Emperor Niall are already\nconnected, and more closely than\nyou might think.
70	But still, you don't go to\nsee him...? Why?
71	Surely there wouldn't be any harm\nin just talking and enjoying each\nother's company?
72	In all honesty...there's\nnothing I'd want more.
73	...
74	I think Emperor Niall would enjoy\na chance to talk with you, too.
75	I mean, isn't that what family's about?
76	I don't think bonds can be cut\nas easily as that, you know?
77	I...that is...
78	Just try. Go see him.
79	Emperor, retainer...\nThat isn't what counts.
80	You don't need some special reason\nto go talk to your brother, Mòrag!
81	And I bet he'd appreciate it, too.
82	Hah. Indeed.\nIt may well be as you say.
83	It's possible that I was the one who\nbuilt a wall between us.
84	You know where to start, right?\nTear down that wall!
85	Yes. I'll do my best.\nThank you, Pyra.
kizunatalk026_ms.json
1	Seems like a good place to rest.
2	Hey, Mythra...\nMay I ask you something?
3	Huh?\nSomething up?
4	I read over my journal again.\nWe used to fight each other quite a lot\nduring training, didn't we?
5	And...it looks like I usually came off\nworse...
6	Don't take it too hard. You really gave\nit all you had. But I guess I've just got\ncertain attributes...
7	Sorry, what did you want to ask?
8	Well, according to my journal...\nit looks like there was one time\nwhere I got the better of you.
9	Huh?
10	It doesn't go into much detail...\nBut still, besting the Aegis is quite\nthe achievement, don't you think?
11	I really need to know how it happened,\nhow I managed to beat you.
12	That's bull.
13	Huh?
14	Your journal is lying to you, Brighid!\nI never lost to you, not once!
15	I don't think so! Why else would\nI have written it down?
16	When, exactly?\nWhat kind of match was it?
17	It was in a camp in the Tornan\nborderlands, on the last day of\ntraining.
18	That doesn't sound right at all!\nIt's nonsense!
19	How should I protest?
20	You're saying my journal is mistaken?
21	Are you calling me a liar?
22	I meant...that fight didn't count!
23	Didn't count? Explain.
24	That fight was right after I'd gone up\nagainst Haze. You begged me to take\nyou on!
25	So that's why it doesn't count!
26	I see.\nYou just don't want to acknowledge\nyour defeat.
27	I told you, you didn't beat me!
28	This is really childish, Mythra.
29	It seems that you only won narrowly in\nmost of our other bouts. I don't know\nhow you can be so stubborn!
30	Hmmm. Are you sure your journal\nisn't just a load of fantasy trash-talk\nwritten down?
31	Mythra. You want a piece\nof me? Come get it!
32	Ladies, please! Making a mountain\nout of a molehill here, aren't we?
33	There's no need to brawl!
34	We're not brawling.
35	That's right.\nWe're just training.
36	OK! Ready yourself!\nAfter so many years, let me set you\nstraight!
37	I'll make it clear this time.\nYou'll know I'm the better fighter once\nand for all!
38	Now, hold on! Not so fast!\nWill someone please intervene...?
39	The truth hurts, Brighid.
40	You purposefully waited for a time\nwhen I was tired out for that fight.\nThat's a cowardly tactic.
41	Shut it! We were pretty evenly\nmatched, my journal said!
42	We're almost level in terms of ability!\nThere's nothing strange about me\nwinning once in a while!
43	Hang on...\nWhy were you recording stuff like that\nin so much detail anyway?
44	Let me get a look at that journal!\nI bet it needs a few corrections!
45	Cut that out! Don't you dare try\nto taint the truth!
46	Ah...Erm...
47	What?
48	Speak up!
49	Do you really thinks it's wise to quarrel\nlike this?
50	This is not a quarrel, Dromarch.\nWithdraw, if you want to retain your\nwhiskers.
51	That's right.\nThis is just a friendly bit of rivalry.\nSo keep your nose out of it!
52	Brighid.\nYou will know my power today.\nFor real.
53	Mythra...\nYou're going to eat those words.
54	Well now...\nYou two certainly have a strange\nconcept of friendship.

1	Ahh, how Tora missed hot springs...
2	This bring back memories of first time\nwe stay in Mor Ardain.
3	The water here is great, right?\nIt just melted the weariness away.
4	Ah, I see.\nSo this is where you stayed...
5	First time I've been here, though.\nBut hang on...
6	Is this place unisex?!
7	Sadly, it is not...\nAre set times for men and women.
8	Ah, right...\nThat sorta system...
9	Hmph...\nToo bad for you.
10	Seems now is right time for\nmen to go bathe. What lads say?\nWe all go, yes?
11	What?
12	What Tora say?
13	All men here! No need to fear nudity!
14	Tora happy to wash everyone's backs!
15	You want all four of us to\nbathe together?
16	Of course yes!
17	Or, is there some problem?
18	No, um, me and Rex are game,\nbut Mòrag, uh...
19	You three go on ahead.\nI shall abstain for now.
20	Mòrag so reserved...\nCome on, all go together!
21	Come come!
22	No, not resist!
23	No, stop!
24	Cease your tugging!
25	...Is it possible that Tora doesn't know\nMòrag is a woman...?
26	Well...it's not like I could tell a Nopon\nwoman apart except from the clothing...
27	And with Mòrag wearing men's clothes,\nmaybe it's no wonder the little guy got\nconfused.
28	Or maybe he just doesn't really care\none way or the other?
29	Mòrag, it OK! Take moment to breathe,\nthen come with.
30	I refuse.
31	Look, Tora understand.\nLots of Nopon not like baths, too.
32	Maybe Mòrag afraid Mòrag drown?
33	But hygiene very important! Have to\nsoak to get nice and clean.
34	I do like water, and I am not filthy...\nBut on this matter, I will not budge.
35	How friend Mòrag be so stubborn,\nwith hot spring right before eyes...
36	Come on Mòrag! Drop clothes\nlike man and jump in hot spring!\nTora not have all day!
37	You know I'm a woman,\ndon't you?
38	Me...me...mehmehmehmeh?!
39	W-w-w-woman...?
40	Yes. I'm a woman, Tora.
41	Meh-meh-mehmehh?!
42	Rex-Rex! Zeke!\nYou know this?!
43	I mean, at a glance...
44	Well for Tora, this discovery of century!\nHave to tell Poppi and others!
45	Well, that's that then, I guess?
46	My. I did not expect this\nwhen I woke up today.
47	Hey Mòrag, how about next time\nyou put on a skirt and some heels?
48	How about you die in a fire, Zeke.
49	In return, Tora ask for help in\nwashing his!
50	Tora strong believer in importance of\nphysical contact for build team bonds!
51	I think I'll excuse myself this time.
52	Mòrag not want to bathe with Tora?
53	Please don't take this the wrong way.
54	It is just...this is a very delicate\nmatter, I'm sure you understand.
55	Is because Tora is Nopon?
56	No! Of course not!\nThat's not it at all!\nI, I just, I have other... Ugh...
57	Oh, Mòrag...
58	Why've you gotta be so stubborn?\nWhy not just play along and make\nTora's little dream come true?
59	Bolt it!\nHow dare you make light of me!
60	Mòrag...\nMaybe worried about feathers in bath?
61	Then no need! Tora is young,\nnot drop feathers so easy!
62	Uhm, no, that's not the problem...
63	Then there only one explanation...\nMòrag really do hate Tora?
64	Nghh... No, that's not true...
65	C'mon Mòrag,\nTora's almost crying here.
66	Urkkk...
67	If Mòrag not hate Tora, then why not\nwant to wash each other's backs...?
68	Oh, for the...
69	Fine...\nLet us bathe together.
70	Huh?!
71	Seriously?!
72	Tora score!
73	But I will bathe in my clothes!\nAnd that is non-negotiable!
74	Uh, good luck trying to explain\nthis to the bath attendants...
kizunatalk028_ms.json
1	Hey, Tora! What's up? You look a little\nbit spaced out, looking at the view like\nthat.
2	Oh! Rex-Rex!
3	Tora was just thinking about when\nthey captured Dadapon.
4	Right... Come to think of it, this was\nthe place where he had to create all\nthose artificial Blades.
5	Dadapon always was bit of a scaredy-\npon. Shy. Couldn't do bad thing, even\nwhen needed to do bad thing.
6	What happened to Dadapon was...
7	Tora...?
8	How could they make him make so\nmany rubbish Blades... Tora cannot\nimagine how bitter it was for Dadapon!
9	Huh?\nHang on a moment, Tora.
10	What is it, Rex-Rex?
11	I thought you were sad because\nyour dadapo- I mean, your dad,\nhe got captured?
12	No. Not that.
13	Dadapon happy whenever working.\nDadapon love his work very much.
14	Really...?
15	Really!
16	Just look at Lila and Rosa. Dadapon's\nnoponality is written all over them.
17	Ah, yeah, it really comes through.
18	But... These new generic ones... No\nspirit. No verve. Maybe most\nimportant things for artificial Blade!
19	...
20	Something wrong, Rex-Rex?
21	Ah, no, just... Passions sure run\nhigh in your family.
22	Why, of course! Spirit of adventure\nlike air we breathe!
23	Let's ask the little guy something...
24	What kind of person was Soosoo?
25	What kind of person was Tatazo?
26	Soosoo? My Grampypon?
27	Poppi interested too!\nTell us, Masterpon!
28	Hmmm... Honestly, Tora not remember\nmuch about about Grampypon.
29	Oh...
30	Grampypon always locked away in lab,\nall by self.
31	Soosoo make lots of experiments and\nresearch?
32	No, usually look at photo books of\nBlades.
33	...
34	Grampypon real stickler for appearance\nand mannerisms of creations.
35	Grampypon really hung up on details.
36	What kind of details, Tora?
37	This not sound very scientific,\nMasterpon.
38	On contrary. Because of Grampypon's\nbook-looking, Poppi is Blade she is\ntoday.
39	Grampypon work very hard to get style\nand poise just right.
40	He had to perfect ether furnace to\nmake his dreams real.
41	Other detail Grampypon liked is\nself-destruct feature, and hidden\ndevices.
42	Grampypon always hunched over plans,\nsnickering to self.
43	To little Tora, looked very much\nlike crazy mad scientist.
44	But, I guess when he invented the ether\nfurnace, his drive and passion paid off.
45	There's a lot of talent in your family,\nTora. No doubt about it!
46	Poppi's a walking testament to his\ngenius.
47	Poppi experiencing very complex\nemotion right now.
48	Dadapon...?
49	Poppi also want to hear about\nMasterpon's Dadapon.
50	Huh... Dadapon quite an introvert\nNopon. Not expert in communication.
51	Tatazo always busy with research?
52	Yes! Every day full of research. From\nmorning to night.
53	At graduation party, was very lonely.\nNot many friends to talk to.
54	But brave enough to ask my Mamapon\nto dance. Very lucky for Tora. This how\nTora get born.
55	Mamapon said Dadapon was so true to\nself, couldn't say no to him.
56	That... That's really heartwarming.
57	Masterpon... Where is your mamapon\nnow?
58	In end, said Dadapon was too true to\nself. So Mamapon went away.
59	So... It's like they got together and\nbroke up for the same reason.
60	Grampypon and Dadapon always\ntogether, working on artificial Blades.
61	Never spend any time with Mamapon.\nMake her unhappy.
62	This make sense to Poppi. Poppi have\nsame problem with Masterpon\nsometimes.
63	Sorry, but there no other way.\nVery busy making dreams real, living\nlife to max.
64	That what Dadapon always say. \nBut always get very sad when Tora\nask him about it.
65	When Mamapon left, Dadapon eat and\ndrink like wild beast for three days, to...\nTo try to fix sadness.
66	...That not sound too healthy.\nPoppi must make sure Masterpon\nnever get that sad, ever...
67	Seems that your dad made a lot of\nsacrifices for his work.
68	But it was those sacrifices that made\nPoppi a reality. I guess we have to be\ngrateful for that.
69	This give Poppi a funny feeling in\nether furnace. Thanks for sharing,\nMasterpon.
70	Oh! Poppi! That nice of you to say.
71	Funny not always mean good,\nMasterpon.
72	Excuse Tora?!
kizunatalk030_ms.json
1	Hey, Poppi...
2	Yes?
3	I was just thinking how curious it is.
4	Even though you look completely\ndifferent, you're still the same Poppi.
5	Poppi very strange.\nEven Tora think so sometimes.
6	Even though you made her?
7	That right!
8	She grew so much, BAM! All at once!
9	Perhaps friends could call Poppi by\nher model name?
10	Very good idea.
11	What do you mean by model name?
12	Well, Poppi's smallest mode\nactually has name: "Poppi α".
13	Oh really? I didn't know that.
14	And this form called\n"Poppi Quixotic Tutelar".
15	Wow, that is a very impressive name!
16	If friends refer to Poppi as "Poppi\nQuixotic Tutelar" when in this\nform, Poppi very happy.
17	That's a little bit of a mouthful!
18	Quixotic Tutelar...
19	True true, it difficult to say! Distinction\nof Poppis maybe too hard now.
20	Really?
21	Yes. In fact, Tora work secretly on\neven more improved mode for Poppi.
22	When that finished, must differentiate\nbetween whole three different modes.
23	But that far too much bother!
24	"Poppi"!
25	That nice and simple, best way to call.
26	What should I say?
27	I agree.
28	What's Poppi's third mode like?
29	Yeah, I think Poppi suits her just fine.
30	It's short, and easy to understand.
31	And besides, no matter how she\nlooks, she's still the same Poppi.
32	That is what you said before.
33	Poppi has no problem with\nbeing called Poppi.
34	Good good.
35	We came full circle.
36	Masterpon, Poppi is curious. What\nis new mode of Poppi like?
37	That excellent question!
38	It called "Quantum\nTechnochampion π"!
39	That is another very impressive name!
40	It sound powerful.
41	Name came to Tora suddenly when he\ndecide whether to enter swimming pool\nwith left or right foot.
42	Name origin story sound\ncompletely irrelevant.
43	So...how exactly are you going to\nremodel Poppi?
44	Tora not decided yet.
45	Oh, really?
46	Name only first step in process.
47	Sounds like it not happen\nany time soon.
48	It not take that long!
49	Tora brainstorm day and night.\nSuddenly one day new design will\nappear like ether bulb over head!
50	That just how inventors do.
51	If Masterpon say so...
52	When inspiration strike, Masterpon\npower up Poppi ASAP. Please, trust\nin Masterpon!
53	Understood. But if Poppi had breath,\nPoppi would not hold it.
54	You not trust Masterpon at all!
55	*giggle*\nAppearances may change, but Poppi\nwill always be Poppi, huh?
kizunatalk031_ms.json
1	Mor Ardain so full of wasteland and\nhard rocks... Not easy for walking!
2	Shall we take a rest around here?
3	Good idea, yes!
4	You need to toughen up a bit, Tora.
5	Tora live whole life cooped up in\nhouse working on building Poppi!\nNot used to walking long distance!
6	If only Tora could flitter-flutter\nlike Gramps...
7	Well, you have those big\near...wing...things.
8	Nopon wings not for flying!\nCould flap forever and not reach sky!
9	If you're really having a hard time\nwalking, you could ask Dromarch\nto give you a ride...
10	Rex-Rex is genius!
11	I think not. I have solemnly sworn to\ncarry none other than my lady.
12	Go on, it can't hurt.
13	Whaaat?!
14	Are you sure about this, my lady?!
15	If you allow Tora to ride me now,\nsoon he will want Poppi to join him,\nand there will be no space left for you!
16	Well, when you put it like that...
17	Sorry, Tora, guess that's a no.
18	Much disappoint...
19	Pyra, are you OK walking?
20	Oh yes, I'm fine.
21	Though all the dust clouds\ndo bother me a little...
22	Oh yeah, those are a pain.\nGets in your eyes sometimes.
23	Poppi also not like that.
24	Small particles get in joints and\ncause nasty creaking when moving...
25	Must ask Masterpon to clean out\nwhen get out of this place.
26	Rex-Rex...
27	It seem like Mor Ardain tricky place\nfor everyone. Rex-Rex have any bright\nideas for helping?
28	Well, let's see...
29	What would be a good idea?
30	I could lend out my salvager suits.
31	Just gotta rough it out!
32	Would anyone like to borrow one of\nmy salvager suits?
33	I suppose that would help\nkeep the sand out...
34	I've got a spare you could borrow.\nYou wanna try it on?
35	...Actually, I guess Nia's the only one\nwho it would really fit.
36	Go on then, I'll give it a try.
37	If it really is useful, we can buy\na whole bunch of 'em sometime!
38	My lady...\nThat suits you surprisingly well.
39	Oh, shurrup.
40	So this is what it's like for Rex\nwhen he goes salvaging, huh?
41	Keeps the sand out pretty well, right?
42	Well, yeah, it does that...
43	But I can't really see. Peripheral\nvision's awful in this thing.
44	It's hard to move about in, too.
45	It might not be very practical\nfor combat...
46	Yeah, I don't think I could fight like this.
47	Looks like genius idea of Rex-Rex\nnot so genius after all.
48	Well, it was worth a try...
49	Ah, the old "grin and bear it" solution.
50	Rex not even try to solve problem?
51	Well, I mean, listening to you guys\ntalk about it does make me think that\nthe sand and dust is a problem...
52	But then I realize it never actually\nbothered me until you mentioned it.
53	It's not like it's making our attacks miss\nor anything, right? I think we're fighting\nas well as we ever have.
54	It's a bit of an irritation, but it's not\ncausing any actual problems.
55	I suppose you're right.
56	Yeah, I guess it's not actually\nslowing me down.
57	Right? So I think as long as we\nkeep our spirits strong, we can\nmake it through this just fine.
58	Well said, Rex!\nI'll do my best to keep going then!
59	I'll try and keep my mind off it, too.
60	All right! Let's keep moving, guys!
61	Right!
62	Is this really solution?
63	Is best solution!
kizunatalk032_ms.json
1	Ooh...\n"A treat fit for a hero"!
2	Snack time already, Nia?\nSpot anything interesting?
3	Nice one, Nia! You sniffed out\na pretty cushty place.
4	Y'know, this was the great\nhero Addam's favorite food!
5	They say it uses an authentic mix of\nspices passed down for 500 years.
6	Tantal is pretty damn cold.\nStands to reason that Addam would\nlike food with a bit of kick to it, eh?
7	A "kick"?
8	Addam was into spicy stuff? Huh.\nHeroes have strange tastes.
9	Rather rude, don't you think?\nSpicy food is delicious!
10	Don't tell me you're some kind of\nnamby-pamby when it comes to heat.
11	And what would be the\nproblem with that?
12	Ha ha ha, for all your tough facade\nyou're really just a little kid ain'tcha?
13	Oi, you watch it, Shellhead.\nYou're askin' for a fight!
14	Hey, no need to get your ears ruffled.\nI'm gonna get some for you and\nyou'll see how wrong you are.
15	Mythra, you want some too?
16	...
17	Huh? What's up?
18	Um, well, you see...
19	Addam didn't like spicy food either.
20	What?
21	Huh?
22	So that means...
23	Addam didn't actually like Addam's\nEmbercakes?
24	So the advertising slogan is just lying?
25	You got it. I never saw him\neat anything that spicy.
26	Even a hint of spice would have him\nrunning for the latrine!
27	Bwahaha!\nSo Addam had a little kid's tastes too.
28	You're kidding me!\nYou can't tell me stories like that.
29	I grew up idolizing Addam, and now\nI can't get that image out of my head.
30	Hey, Mythra.\nDo you have any other funny stories?
31	Funny stories?\nI wonder if I can remember anything.
32	So like, what was Addam's real\nfavorite food?
33	Well, that would be Pan-Fried Tartari.
34	Just like Rex!
35	Yeah.
36	Addam would just light up at the\nsight of it.
37	It really sounds like the Great Hero was\njust a big kid when it came to food.
38	Anything else?
39	Stop, stop!\nI can't take anymore!
40	Can you please leave at least some of\nmy admiration for him untainted?
41	What do you care?\nAddam was just a guy like anyone else.
42	Look who's the big kid\nnow, Shellhead!
43	You arse, Nia. You're loving this,\naren't you?
44	Dammit!
45	I'm going to have to reread "Addam, the\nGreat Hero" to scrub my mind.
46	Yep. It's a total marketing gimmick.\nA load of bull, in other words.
47	Bloody liars!\nThe cheek of it!
48	Steady on just a second, chaps.\nIt's not definite that they're lying.
49	Eh?
50	Even if this wasn't Addam's favorite\nfood, you've still gotta hand it to them.
51	Keeping 500-year-old traditions alive\nis a pretty noble thing.
52	So what if they did exaggerate? Maybe\nAddam had a bite when Mythra wasn't\nlooking and thought "this is jolly tasty".
53	No need to get so worked up,\nShellhead.
54	Who's worked up?
55	It's nothing to me.
56	I'm just saying, don't go around calling\nancient recipes a lie for no reason!
57	Ah, OK, I see what's\ngoing on here.
58	I've a sneaking suspicion that this\nmight be Zeke's favorite food...
59	Wha-
60	Oh, is it your favorite because you\nbelieved their shtick about Addam?
61	Uhh...
62	Bwahaha, busted!\nIs that why you took it to heart?
63	You're like a little kid!
64	Wh-wh-what's wrong with that?!
65	I grew up believing this was\nAddam's favorite food!
66	It's been enchanting kids for 500\nyears now!
67	I'm not gonna let the words of\none Blade take that away!
68	Sure, but that still doesn't change the\nfact that Addam didn't like spicy food.
69	He'd never eat this stuff of his\nown volition.
70	Aaaagh!
71	You're shattering my image of him!\nMy precious childhood innocence...
72	I don't believe anyone\nor anything anymore...
73	Don't be like that, Shellhead.
74	Cheer up, I'll buy you an embercake!\nHah!

1	So, Rex, you lived here?
2	Huh? No, this was my getaway.\nYou know, like a secret hideout.
3	I lived on Gramps.\nI'd moor him next to\nthat cliff over the way.
4	What kind of kid were you, Rex?
5	I dunno. I've not really thought about it.
6	I bet you're curious too, right Nia?
7	Oh, er, well, maybe a bit.
8	I could tell you a few stories about\nwhen Rex was younger.
9	Ah yes... He was a wild child, that's\nfor sure. A bit of a tearaway.
10	He was never the biggest child, but he\nhad a strong sense of justice. Always\npicking fights with the local bullies!
11	I think I still have the bumps to prove it.
12	So he's been this full of energy his\nwhole life?
13	Sounds like you were a right handful!
14	My my, you certainly seem interested.
15	Well then, perhaps I'll tell you\nmy best Rex story.
16	What should I say?
17	Whoa, wait just a sec!
18	Go on then. I've got nothing to hide!
19	What do you mean, "best"?
20	One day, one of the local kids\nwas attacked by a monster.
21	Without thinking, Rex jumped\nin to help him.
22	That's our reckless Rex!
23	That's your story?\nOf course I'm gonna help someone\nin danger!
24	What happened after that?
25	Both Rex and the kid had to\nbe rescued by the villagers.
26	Huh? Wasn't Rex meant to be\nthe one doing the rescuing?
27	That was his plan. Unfortunately, he\njust ended up in the same hot water.
28	Hah. Rex, you genius.
29	That night, I heard Rex\nbawling his eyes out.
30	Was he was in pain from his wounds,\nI asked.
31	But he replied "No, I just wish\nI'd been able to save my friend."
32	Injury held no fear for him, but\nthe anguish of not being able to\nsave his friend was unbearable.
33	And he cried about that?
34	What's the big deal?\nKids cry. It's normal!
35	No, Rex. Nia is impressed.
36	Aren't you?
37	Sure.
38	I was surprised at your bravery.\nEven at that age...
39	We admire you, Rex.
40	Aw, stoppit! You'll make me blush.
41	Ho ho ho.\nI told you it was a good story!
42	Gramps'll just exaggerate it anyway.
43	So you won't mind me telling\nthem about the time you wet yourself\nwhen there was a monster attack?
44	Huh?\nNo, that's not-
45	W-wet yourself?
46	Rex, you baby.
47	That was just when I was a kid!\nI don't do it anymore!
48	Don't even think about carrying\non with the story, Gramps!
49	Aw, c'mon. We wanna hear!
50	No!\nPyra, please... You don't want to hear\nit, do you?
51	Um...\nActually, I kind of do.
52	Huh?!
53	This is a story about the time one of\nthe local bullies fell foul of a monster.
54	Rex didn't hesitate. He packed up and...
55	Gramps, please stop!
56	Is wetting yourself really that\nembarrassing?
57	Super embarrassing! Nia, don't tell me\nit's never happened to you!
58	...
59	Maybe we should hear a different story.
60	Oho, you'd like to hear an even\nmore embarrassing story?
61	No! Stop!\nDon't encourage him, Pyra!
62	Huh? I just want to know as\nmuch about you as possible, Rex.
63	Well said.\nDrivers and Blades should know\neverything about each other.
64	Yeah, well, there's everything\nand there's EVERYTHING.\nCan we please just drop it?

1	Coming to this place always\ncalms me right down.
2	I know what you mean.\nIt's so empty...in a good way.
3	They've got a good salvaging\nbusiness going, but the place\nisn't bustling like Argentum.
4	And they don't have a super-developed\nprimary sector like Gormott.
5	If you just want to live out your days\nin peace, there's really no better place.
6	You talk like an old man sometimes.
7	What d'you think, Mòrag?
8	I would like to live here awhile.
9	Oh? Wasn't expecting that from you.
10	Seeing such hospitality has been a\nrefreshing experience for me. It's lovely\nto learn how the common folk live.
11	I quite agree.
12	It's very different from staying\nat a city inn.
13	I guess you two are used to\nthe high life, huh...
14	Are you so different yourself?
15	Since we left Tantal, we've been\nspending a lot of our nights\nroughing it up outdoors, huh?
16	Sure have.
17	It was pretty tough when we were\ncamping out waiting for you lot in\nUraya and Mor Ardain.
18	Always on our toes, thinking you might\nshow up any moment.
19	Yeah, I don't miss those hungry\ncamping days. We came pretty\nclose to eating Turters...
20	Let's not talk about that.\nIt's painful to remember.
21	Waiting in the port here was\npretty all right, though.
22	Yeah, we could rest up in\nthe ship, at least.
23	...It sounds like you've\nbeen through a lot.
24	Stakeouts are one experience\nI would rather avoid.
25	Anyway, that's enough about the past!
26	There was something I wanted\nto ask you, Mòrag.
27	You've seen how smashing this\nplace is, right?
28	I'm just worried that Mor Ardain\nand Uraya might wind up fighting\nover it or something.
29	Not any time soon, I should hope.
30	If either nation were to make a\nmove on these islands, it would be\ntantamount to a declaration of war.
31	Mor Ardain, at least, has no\ndesire for such conflict.
32	Ah, right.
33	Well, that's pretty reassuring at least.
34	Why are you so invested in the\nfate of these islands, anyway?
35	How should I answer?
36	'Cos it's where Rex grew up.
37	'Cos there's no place like it in Alrest.
38	Ain't it natural to worry about\nyour friend's hometown?
39	I suppose so.
40	As long as this place is safe, our chum\ncan focus on the task he's gotta do.
41	Don't want to let other worries start\ncreeping in to distract him, do I?
42	Real thoughtful, that is.
43	You said it! I'm the best!\nHahahah!
44	...And he just had to go and ruin it.
45	That's quite the grand statement.
46	I reckon an environment like this\nis the only place a chap like Rex\ncould grow up.
47	Oh...?
48	Like, if a kid grows up in Alba Cavanich,\nhe's gonna want to join the army, right?
49	Not saying that's bad or anything, but\nI don't think a kid like that would wind\nup as the Aegis's Driver.
50	Can't be easy raising the kind of\nboy who could change the future\nof Alrest.
51	All the world's nations and\nestablishments aren't gonna\nfoster that kind of potential.
52	But this village? It's cut off from\nall that. A place of freedom and\npossibilities.
53	Ah, I see...
54	Once in a while, you actually\nsay some princely stuff.
55	Shut it, you.
56	I have to say, I agree with Zeke.
57	Villages like this have an important\nplace in Alrest...
58	We must do our utmost to\nkeep them all from harm.
kizunatalk036_ms.json
1	These ruins are quite remarkable.
2	Indeed. This style of architecture\ncannot be found in Mor Ardain.
3	There's plenty of ruins in Tantal too,\nbut nothing quite like this.
4	Must be something to do with\nthe Titans here.
5	How would you even build a place\nlike this anyway?
6	I explained before, did I not?
7	Probably wasn't listening.
8	Maybe it was before he joined\nup with us?
9	Hmm... Was it? I can't recall.
10	In any case, no harm in\nrepeating myself.
11	The Leftherian Archipelago consists of\na mountainous Cloud Sea formation and\nnumerous Titans gathered like islands.
12	All of those smaller Titans are circling\naround a much larger one...
13	But that larger Titan is hidden\ndeep within the cloud mountains.
14	So...looking at the size of these\nruins, we must be inside that\nbig Titan right now?
15	Yes, precisely.
16	Wow, what a crazy sort of place.
17	That doesn't answer the question of\nhow anyone made all this, though.
18	I mean, I doubt they carried all this\nrock through the Village Guardian...
19	Perhaps it was built before this\nlarge Titan submerged itself\nin the Cloud Sea?
20	Ah, that'd make sense. So back on the\nsurface, it was just like any other Titan.
21	Then at some point those cloud\nmountains formed around it, creating\nthe Archipelago we know today.
22	Yes, that would explain how\nthis place came to be.
23	But even so, it would be very difficult\nto build structures of this size today.
24	Indeed...
25	We have neither the labor forces\nrequired, nor sufficient land available.
26	I doubt Mor Ardain, Uraya, or Tantal\ncould construct something like this\nin today's climate.
27	...Pandy.
28	When I die, you don't have to build a\nmonument this grand for me, OK?
29	I'm gonna be gone as soon as\nyou are, you know!
30	Besides, I don't think you need a\ngravestone. A snowman'll do for you,\nheheh!
31	Where am I being buried,\nTheosoir Rear Gate?
32	Though a snowman does sound\npretty nice.
33	You're fine with that...?
34	Anyway, while we're talking\nabout graves...
35	Who should I ask?
36	Where's your grave gonna be, Rex?
37	Where's your grave gonna be, Mòrag?
38	My grave?!
39	I...guess I've never thought about it.
40	You're still pretty young, after all.
41	You calling me old?!
42	I guess I'd probably like to be buried\nalongside my parents in Fonsett.
43	How would you fancy here in Elpys?
44	Uh... I don't know about that...
45	Yeah, this place is so big and empty,\nyou'd die of loneliness.
46	After he's already dead?
47	I think I'd rather stay close to the\npeople I love. Though it's still pretty\nweird to think about.
48	Well, that's a nice way of looking at it.
49	My manner of burial is already decided.
50	There is a proud Ardainian tradition to-
51	Yeah, OK, I'm gonna stop you there.\nThanks for the predictable answer.
52	Wha...?!
53	Then ask me again. I will endeavor to\nmake my response more entertaining.
54	Lady Mòrag, I don't think there\nis any need to-
55	You are aware of how I dislike\nto be outdone, are you not?
56	All right, let's do this.
57	Where's your grave going to be?
58	A snowman at Theosoir Rear Gate!
59	Wha...?!
60	Wait, are you gonna marry into\nTantal royalty or something?
61	Wha...?! Of course I will not! I was just\nimitating Zeke's amusing remark...
62	Perhaps I should have chosen\na grave in Fonsett instead!
63	Whaaa?!
64	That's also not exactly, er...
65	Ugh!
66	Hahahah! Looks like Mòrag's\ngot a thing or two to learn when\nit comes to the funnies!
67	Ah, to be young and carefree again.\nTo think they can joke around in a\nplace like this...
kizunatalk037_ms.json
1	Hey, Pandoria.\nZeke's a rather unlucky guy, is he not?
2	Isn't it difficult, being his partner?
3	Oh, yes. That Prince of mine, he's\nunlucky like you wouldn't believe.
4	If there was an All-Alrest Unluckiness\nChampionship, he'd win every time.
5	From the incidents I've witnessed\nalone, he's already been chased by\nrolling rocks, fallen off cliffs...
6	He even fell into the Cloud Sea once,\nas I recall.
7	Haha, you ain't seen the half of it.
8	When he's walking in the harbor,\nhe's always getting bitten or smacked\nround the face by the Titan ships.
9	Oh, this one time, he got caught in a\nblizzard, took shelter in a cave, and\nwound up surrounded by 100 Ignas!
10	Ahaha! I could keep going for hours.
11	Well, I don't quite know how to react.
12	Frankly, I'm impressed you're both\nstill alive.
13	Yes, congratulations on surviving.\nOr should I say, my condolences?
14	Too far, Brighid. Too far.
15	Still, I gotta admit keeping an eye\non my Prince is a full-time job.
16	You should try it yourself some time.\nHe drives me crazy.
17	How shall I respond?
18	But you love him all the same, yes?
19	You sound almost like his mother.
20	Love?! Where the hell'd you pull\nTHAT one out of? Eheheh...
21	Ah yes, I see. You pretend to dislike\nhim while secretly harboring feelings.
22	Maybe it's time you should be more\nhonest with yourself?
23	Oh, for the...you've got to be kidding\nme! You couldn't be more wrong!
24	There's no need to be shy, my dear.
25	As a fellow Blade, I'll be happy to\nkeep this just between us.
26	Quite so. We will keep your little\nsecret from your beloved Prince\nuntil such time as you see fit.
27	I'm trying to tell you, it's not like that!
28	Oh, you're so cute when you\nget embarrassed.
29	Hmhm! I quite agree...
30	Hey! Stop that!\nDon't you give me that knowing smile!
31	Ughhhh, curse you, my Prince, and\nyour unlucky nature!
32	Oh yes, he's such a frightful\nlittle sonny Jim...
33	...Wait, who're you calling his mom?!
34	At least go for big sister or something!
35	Ah, what a comeback! What\nimpeccable comedic delivery!
36	Haha, you like it?\nYou've gotta have a sharp wit when\nyou're dealing with that guy.
37	But comedy aside... It all comes\nback to his blasted bad luck.
38	If you had to deal with some of the\nstuff I've been through, you'd be\nworrying like an old maid, too.
39	When it really counts, he can be a\nproper hero, but the rest of the time...\nI just don't know what to do with him.
40	It wouldn't be Zeke without a little\nbad luck, though, would it?
41	I quite agree. It's an integral\npart of his identity!
42	Yep...and ain't that just the\nworst thing?
43	*sigh*\nThe things I put up with for my Prince...
kizunatalk039_ms.json
1	How remarkable...
2	That view down below is the\nworld where we live, isn't it?
3	So it would appear.
4	I had no idea it was possible for\nhumans to reach these kind of heights.
5	And this World Tree's been around\nsince forever, too.
6	I'm not sure I can keep up with\nwhat we're finding out here.
7	Hey, Prince! Look!
8	Over down there!
9	What is it?\nYou see something?
10	Look, right over there! It's Genbu!\nThat's gotta be Genbu!
11	Seriously?!
12	Wow, you're right...\nThat does look like Tantal!
13	What are you talking about?\nOf course we can't see Tantal\nfrom all the way up here.
14	We totally can, though!\nCome over and take a look!
15	How shall I respond?
16	I'm sure it's just a cloud or something.
17	Frankly, I'm not interested.
18	I don't see any sign of Tantal anywhere.
19	Not over there, over here!
20	Look, right there!
21	It's so small, it's difficult to judge.
22	Are you sure you're not imagining it?
23	No imagining going on here!\nThat's Genbu, no doubt about it!
24	Hmmm... Is it, though?
25	Brighid...
26	What is it, Lady Mòrag?
27	Well, it's just... I think I may have\nspotted Mor Ardain down there.\nDo you think that's really it?
28	What?
29	Oh hey, you found your place too?
30	Where do you mean?
31	Over there - next to that\nstrangely-shaped cloud...
32	Ah, I see the one you mean.
33	Doesn't that distinctive shape\nlook just like Mor Ardain?
34	I do believe you're right... Those wide\nplains look just the right shape.
35	And those shapes flying around it\nmust be Titan battleships!
36	I thought as much!
37	Incredible how one can feel the\nmajesty of Mor Ardain from all\nthe way up here...
38	Quite right, Lady Mòrag!
39	Hold on, you two. Take a closer look.
40	I'm pretty sure that's the Leftherian\nislands. Mor Ardain doesn't have\nall that greenery, does it?
41	Ahh...
42	Urk...
43	Aww, c'mon. You're no fun.
44	We've come all the way to a crazy\nplace like this, the least you can do\nis enjoy yourself a bit!
45	I'm in the wrong here?\nMight I remind you, we did not\ncome here to have fun.
46	Everyone needs to let their hair down\nonce in a while, Brighid.
47	Lady Mòrag?
48	Myself, I have already spotted\nthe Leftherian Archipelago.
49	What?! Those tiny little islands?!
50	Well, whaddaya know!\nMòrag's really getting into this!
51	C'mon, Prince, we can't let\nher beat us!
52	No chance of that.\nTake a look over there.
53	Huh? I can't see anything...
54	Look real close. There's a tiny dot\nright there, see? I'm pretty sure that's\nGoldmouth, the Argentum HQ!
55	Goldmouth?! Are you certain?!
56	Where is this dot?\nI'm not seeing anything.
57	Yes, that must be Goldmouth!\nI'm sure of it!
58	You can see it, Lady Mòrag?!
59	Brighid! We must find something new\nourselves, else I fear we have lost!
60	When did this become a competition?
61	If that is Goldmouth...
62	Would that be the Maelstrom next to it?
63	Um... Well... I suppose it could be?
64	Oh! Look down there, Brighid!
65	The Nopon sailors on board the\nMaelstrom are waving to us!
66	Whaaa?!
67	Uh, Mòrag, I think you might be\npushing it a bit with that one.
68	I tell you no lie, I saw it\nwith my own eyes!
69	Seriously?
70	Ah... Lady Mòrag...
71	I think you may just be seeing\nTora's reflection in the window.
72	No, you're wrong. I'm certain it was the\ncrew of the Maelstrom!
73	...
74	Well, that was a bunch of fun.
75	Yeah. If I learned one thing today,\nit's that Mòrag HATES to lose.

1	Hey Zeke, Pandoria.\nYou got a moment?
2	Sure, what's up?\nYou're not usually the type\nto start a serious discussion.
3	Well y'see, it's about Turters...
4	Turters?!
5	Sorry, but Turters is our mascot.\nI know he's the cutest little chap in\nthe world, but you can't have him.
6	You heard the Prince.\nIf you ask nicely, we might allow\nyou to pat him on the head...
7	Uh-huh.
8	Thanks for confirming what\nI already guessed.
9	You haven't even noticed, have you?\nHe's been crawling into my bed\nevery night.
10	H-he's been what?!
11	If I'm not super careful, I worry I'm\ngoing to crush the little guy in my sleep.
12	But like you say, he's your\nprecious little mascot, yeah?\nI figured you'd be mad if I hurt him.
13	So it's been keeping me awake\nthe whole damn night.
14	Well, I guess I should apologize\non Turters' behalf.
15	Honestly, weren't you meant\nto be keeping an eye on him?
16	Hahah! Well, you know me!\nOnce my head hits the sheets,\nI'm out for the count!
17	Hmmm...
18	We'd better find a way\nto stop him wandering off.
19	What would be a good plan?
20	He could sleep in my bed?
21	Let's flip this whole issue on its head.
22	Yeah...\nThat might be the best solution.
23	He used to sleep in my bed back\nin the day, anyway. It'll be fine.
24	I guess that settles it.\nThanks, Pandoria!
25	You can count on me!
26	Hang on, though. You said he used to\nsleep in your bed "back in the day"...\nJust how long have you had this turtle?
27	Oh, it hasn't been as long as me and\nold Princey here, but...it's been quite\na while, I think?
28	Huh. It's just that he's so small.\nI always assumed he was pretty\nyoung.
29	So what would you do if he grew\nup to be Dromarch-sized?
30	The things that go through that\nhead of yours...
31	Watch it, you.
32	He wouldn't be quite so portable\nif that were to happen.
33	Right? It got me wondering, would you\nguys stick together even then?
34	Why, I could ride around\non top of Turters instead!
35	You mean, like Nia and Dromarch?
36	Yeah. That sounds pretty sweet, right?!
37	You'd probably get left behind. A lot.
38	And how.
39	Yeah, you know what?
40	I'm just gonna be glad that Turters\nstayed this size.
41	Flip it?
42	On its head?
43	Yuh-huh.
44	I mean, Turters is one of\nthe gang too, right?
45	So I figure, me and Zeke can't\nkeep hogging him forever.
46	He doesn't belong to any one person.\nHe's a precious mascot, to each and\nevery one of us.
47	So what I say is, why don't we all\npitch in on looking after him?
48	Oh, right! Great idea!
49	Right? If Nia's helping us out too,\nthere's no problem with Turters\nsleeping in her bed.
50	Hold it, hold it. This isn't solving the\nissue of how I get some sleep.
51	You can't just lump it all on me.\nGet someone else to help.
52	Hmmm... Maybe Dromarch could\nlook after him?
53	Could work. He's basically a big fuzzy\npillow.
54	Actually, the same goes for Tora!
55	More like a little fluffy pillow, but yes!
56	Hey... Are you two actually just fed up\nof taking care of Turters?
57	?!
58	Pe-perish the thought!\nRight, Pandy?
59	Yeah, we love Turters. Sometimes\nI forget to feed him, but he's great.
60	I'm starting to understand why he\ncomes running to me every night...
kizunatalk041_ms.json
1	Masterpon was in good mood today.\nTalked with Poppi 16 times.
2	Poppi also talked with\nPyra 31 times today.
3	What are you doing, Poppi?
4	Oh, Brighid!\nPoppi just writing diary.
5	Poppi decided to leave records of life,\njust like Brighid!
6	But you can't be returned to a Core\nCrystal like us, so you're not in danger\nof losing your memories, are you?
7	Poppi's body is very complex device.\nIf important part damaged by attack,\nmemory could be corrupted.
8	Ah, I see. At a glance, your body seems\npractically flawless, but I suppose it\ncomes with its own troubles.
9	Brighid right. It like Masterpon\noften say - Poppi's delicate body\nalways in need of TLC!
10	Tora...says that to you, does he?\n...Remind me to have a word\nwith him later.
11	Um, Brighid...
12	Can Poppi ask why Brighid care so\nmuch about preserving past memories?
13	Poppi started diary, but never know\nwhat to write. Maybe Brighid can help.
14	What should I tell her?
15	I don't want to lose myself forever.
16	I want to keep being the same person.
17	If Brighid not have diary,\nno more Brighid?
18	Poppi thought even if Brighid go back\nto Core Crystal, just need to find new\nDriver and then Brighid come back.
19	But is that really true?
20	If I were to return to my Crystal and\nremain that way for a long time...
21	By the time I was reawakened, all\nwho knew me could be long gone.
22	If the Brighid who lived through that\ntime no longer exists in my memories\nor the memories of others...
23	Who's to say that I existed\nin that time at all?
24	Hmmmm...
25	Might be difficult to prove, that true.
26	If nobody knows of my existence,\nI may as well not have existed.
27	That thought...it troubles me.
28	After all, it's the time I spend\nwith those dear to me that\nmakes me who I am.
29	The happy memories, the sad ones.\nAll of them together. Without them,\nI don't think I would be myself.
30	To lose all of that forever...it would be\nlike denying not only myself, but the\npeople I spent those times with.
31	Masterpon teach Poppi many things.\nPoppi not want to forget all that.
32	Masterpon pour everything into\nmaking Poppi!
33	Precisely. So if you hold him dear,\na diary filled with memories of him\nshould be just as precious.
34	Because memories are what connect us\nto others, and to the world we live in.
35	Poppi think Poppi understand.\nWill try best to write good diary!
36	Will fill diary with memories of\neveryone! Even Brighid!
37	That's very kind of you, Poppi.\nI'm sure your diary will be wonderful.
38	Meh-meh?
39	Brighid is Brighid. Why would Brighid\nbe somebody else?
40	Well, imagine if one day you were to\nforget all your memories of Tora, and\nstart working for a new master.
41	Would that Poppi still be the same\nPoppi I am talking to right now?
42	Hmmmm... Poppi is Poppi...
43	But that Poppi would be new\nMasterpon's Poppi. Not the same\nas Tora's Poppi.
44	Probably would not even wear\nfrilly maid outfits.
45	I...see. Well, maid outfits aside,\ndo you see what I'm getting at?
46	While my past selves are all Brighid,\nthey are all different Brighids. Living\ndifferent lives, with different people.
47	They're not directly connected to\nthe person I am today.
48	Yes... Poppi think Poppi understand.
49	Brighid want to keep being this Brighid.\nThat why leave diary full of memories.
50	Precisely.
51	Even if I return to my Core Crystal\nand lose my memories...
52	By reading my diary, my new self\ncan hold on to some part of the\nperson I am today.
53	Though of course, this relies on the\nassumption that Mor Ardain will pass\nmy diary on to my new self.
54	Brighid... How can Poppi make sure\nPoppi's diary gets passed down?
55	A good question... Tora isn't the\nmost reliable fellow, is he?
56	Masterpon would use diary as pillow\nfor naps and for prop up wobbly table.
57	Perhaps you should take the time\nto think of the best solution to that\nproblem yourself.
58	Not only writing memories every day,\nbut also finding best way to preserve...\nDiary is quite difficult task!

1	So how d'you like this palace, eh?\nJust as good as your Ardainian one.
2	For a man who abandoned his country,\nyou're certainly proud of it.
3	Hey. That's a low blow.
4	Do you think you'll return\nfor good someday?
5	...That's a toughie.
6	What is it that's stopping you?
7	Hey, Mòrag.\nIs your country important to you?
8	That was kind of out of the blue...
9	Come on, just tell me.\nWould you protect your country\nover anything else in the world?
10	How should I answer...
11	Without a doubt.
12	Would you not?
13	Why do you ask?
14	Well, I mean... As a prince, of course\nyou're gonna want to protect your\ncountry and your people.
15	But...is that really enough?
16	What do you mean?
17	This world, it's stretched to its limit.\nWe've both seen that on our travels.
18	...
19	Now, my old man, he closed off our\ncountry from the outside world.\nWhy? To protect his people.
20	But that's not a real solution.\nThat's just running away from reality.
21	Maybe you can protect your own\npeople like that, for a while. But when\nthe world ends, you're just as dead.
22	I just couldn't bring myself to agree\nwith the way he does things.
23	And...that's why you left?
24	Yeah... If I can use my power to help\nsave the world, even a little...
25	I figured, that's what I have to do.\nHelp the people who need it.
26	Of course, I was younger then,\nwith naive ambitions.
27	In the end, I just wound up learning\nhow powerless I really am.
28	But you haven't given up yet, have you?\nYou're still trying to save the world.
29	Course I am. If you don't have the\npower, you gotta try even harder.
30	If you can't do it alone, then you gotta\nfind some friends to back you up.
31	Mòrag. You're one of those people,\nright? Someone I can count on.
32	Haha...\nI'm with you, Zeke.
33	Wishing to protect your country is both\na natural impulse and a duty, is it not?
34	That's the one! That's exactly\nwhat my old man used to say.
35	But...is that really enough?
36	What do you mean?
37	This crazy world's right at its limit.\nIf it carries on like this, it's done for.
38	My old man... He chose to close his\neyes to the outside world and only\nthink of the safety of our country.
39	A king's first duty is to protect his\nnation. I don't think I can blame him\nfor the choice he made.
40	Well, yeah... But is it really OK to just\nthink of yourself?
41	Can you really be happy when you're\nshut up in your own world like that?
42	If we carry on like this, our whole world\nhas had it. And you can't have a\ncountry without a world.
43	That's why his attitude drove me crazy.
44	Sitting doing nothing as the whole\nshebang falls down... That's no way\nfor anyone to live.
45	I can't just give up on the future like\nthat.
46	That's why I left Tantal.\nAnd that's why I can't go back,\nnot until the world is safe.
47	Hahah... You're a remarkably\nstraightforward man.
48	Honestly, I'm a little jealous of the way\nyou can follow your heart so freely.
49	Hey, what are you saying?
50	It's not like it's hard. You should try it\nyourself - just say what you think!
51	Hah...
52	Straightforward guys like you and Rex\nare all very well, but I think someone\nneeds to attend to the finer details.
53	Jeez, you let me have it with both\nbarrels there... But thanks.
54	You can count on me for that, Zeke!

1	Say, Rex. Do you truly believe\nthat Elysium exists?
2	Do you even have to ask?
3	Don't you, Mòrag? I don't understand\nwhy you'd even be here then!
4	No...that's not what I mean.
5	I just wanted to clarify how\neveryone truly feels.
6	After all, don't most people only\nknow of Elysium from fairy tales?
7	Well, I guess so, but...
8	Our chum here's seen the real deal\nin his dreams or whatever, right?
9	There were wide green fields and a\nwarm breeze, and a beautiful city\nlike nothing I've ever seen...
10	Pyra was standing on top of a hill\noverlooking it all.
11	I'm sure it must have been Elysium.\nThere's no place like it in Alrest.
12	The place you saw in your dream...
13	Is it prudent to believe in Elysium\nbased on that information alone,\nI wonder?
14	Don't you trust me and Pyra, Mòrag?
15	Oh no, I trust you both.
16	But just because a place exists in\nyour dreams, does not necessarily\nmean it exists in reality.
17	Zeke, can you honestly say you have\nnever doubted Elysium's existence\nin the slightest?
18	Well, I guess I have wondered from\ntime to time.
19	At the end of the day, the only way\nto be truly sure is to go there, right?
20	True enough.
21	As for now, Rex believes it's real,\nand that's enough for me.
22	Aww, Zeke!
23	I mean, sure, it's best for everyone\nif it does exist, but even if it doesn't,\ndoes that really change anything?
24	Our chum's on a mission to help\nPyra reach her dream.
25	Whatever the outcome, I want to\nsee that through to the end.
26	A mission...
27	So what if there's no proof?\nChasing after dreams is what real\nmen are born to do!
28	Very well. I appreciate your passion.
29	Though I'm not quite sure I understand\nyour notion of a "real man".
30	Hey, no worries.\nYou'll figure it out eventually.
31	I mean, you're basically the\nmanliest one here!
32	...Zeke. There are some things in this\nworld you don't joke about.
33	Even my temper has its limits.
34	Would you like me to teach you\na lesson you won't ever forget?
35	Uh, Mòrag?\nYou're scaring me a little...
36	Hold it, hold it!\nI was just joking around!
37	Hehehe...
38	L-listen, nobody needs to\ndie here, OK? ...OK?!
39	Say, Rex. Do you really think that\nplace is Elysium?
40	It's a tough sell, for sure. That barren\nwasteland is nothing like the paradise\nin the fairy tales...
41	To be honest, I'm not even sure myself.
42	The Elysium I saw first was a warm\nplace, full of sunlight and greenery.
43	Do you think that Elysium still\nexists somewhere else?
44	No... We definitely made it\nto the right place.
45	There was no greenery or sunlight,\nbut it was still the same place as\nthe Elysium I saw.
46	Then what, you think the paradise\nElysium was never anything more\nthan a dream?
47	I don't think we can say that for sure.
48	Perhaps what Rex saw was how\nElysium truly was, long ago.
49	Long ago?
50	Yes. A vision of an older Elysium, taken\nfrom within someone's memories.
51	So our chum here was dreaming\nabout...someone else's memories?
52	That's pretty freaky stuff.
53	Yes, it's certainly far from an\nordinary phenomenon.
54	...
55	If the passage of time could turn the\nElysium I saw into...that...
56	Maybe Alrest could end up like that\ntoo someday.
57	Indeed. It is the same as the Tornan\nTitan we saw in Morytha. All things\ndeteriorate, over time.
58	But time isn't the threat right now.\nMalos could turn Alrest into a\nwasteland like that any time...
59	True enough...
60	And I daresay neither we humans\nnor even the Titans themselves\ncould survive in such a world.
61	That's why we have to stop him,\nno matter what!
62	That's the spirit I like to see, chum!
63	I thought you might be depressed that\nElysium wasn't all you'd hoped, but\nI guess I needn't have worried.
64	Rex is not so weak as to let\nsomething like this set him back.
65	His strength of will is what has\ncarried us all this far.
66	Wh-what's up with you two\nall of a sudden? There's no\npoint flattering me, you know!
67	Don't fret, chum. You just keep doing\nwhat you always do.
68	Yes...keep forging our path ahead.\nWe're counting on you.
kizunatalk044_ms.json
1	Hey Pandy.\nI just had a thought...
2	Oh no.
3	Don't be so quick to judge! You don't\neven know what I'm going to say!
4	Well you're not the most sophisticated\nof thinkers. I can read you like a book.
5	Hey, you can't talk to your\nDriver like that!
6	Go on then. If I'm so easy to\nread, what am I thinking?
7	You ARE that easy to read and you just\ncame up with a new title for yourself.
8	Uh...
9	Haha, bingo.
10	You are sooo predictable.\nGo on then, what is it this time?
11	I promise not to laugh.\nYou can tell your big sis.
12	Big sis? ...Wait a sec! What makes you\nthink it'll be something to laugh at?!
13	Listen, when I tell you my new title,\nyou're gonna be proper impressed.
14	Zeke von Genbu,\nCHAOTIC Bringer of Chaos!
15	*snort*
16	Oi!\nI heard that!
17	You can't deny the coolness\nof the name, surely!
18	Of course not. It's very cool. Suits\nyou down to a tee. Super cool.
19	You're not even pretending to\nbe serious! Why don't you try again?
20	*giggle*\nIt's so funny watching you guys.
21	Oh, hello Pyra!\nYou arrived at just the right time.
22	We're getting nowhere with Pandoria.\nPyra, lend us your judgment.
23	Who, me?
24	Yes, you! What do you think?
25	Zeke von Genbu,\nChaotic Bringer of Chaos!
26	What DO I think?
27	That's a fantastic name!
28	Honestly, it's kind of goofy.
29	Right? Obviously!\nI knew you'd know what's what.
30	No need to worry about hurting his\nfeelings, Pyra. You can be honest.
31	I am being honest!\nI think it's a very creative name.
32	Eh?\nNo way... You're kidding, right?
33	Finally, somebody who actually\nunderstands! At least SOMEONE does.
34	Go on, Pyra! You need a title as well.
35	Huh? Me?
36	Yes! Something that really captures\nthe spirit of who you are.
37	Steady on, My Prince.\nPyra doesn't want a stupid name.
38	OK, lay it on me, Zeke!\nGimme that title!
39	Someone's gotten carried away...
40	Right then. From now on, Pyra,\nyou shall be...
41	Pyra von Aegis, Omen of\nRetribution!
42	Pyra von Aegis, Omen of\nRetribution...?
43	Uhh, really Pyra... If you don't like it,\nyou shoulda just said so.
44	I love it!
45	To be honest, I don't really know what\nit's supposed to mean. But it's so cool!
46	What on Alrest is going on?\nThese two are incorrigible.
47	Right? Just like I thought.\nPyra GETS me.
48	In fact, maybe YOU should\njust be my Blade!
49	A-ah...I think I'm good, thanks.
50	Huh?
51	You're very amusing, Zeke, but Drivers\nneed to be a lot more than amusing.
52	What?
53	Ahahaha! You're going to\nneed an Ice Art for that burn.
54	That was worth the wait. It's gonna\ntake him some time to recover.
55	And it's redundant as well.
56	Urk...
57	My Prince?!
58	Too...too blunt. It struck me...\nright to my very heart...
59	Hang in there! It's just a flesh wound!\nYou're going to be just fine!
60	Huh?\nIs Zeke OK?
61	No... Remember me well, friends...
62	What?!\nI-I'm so sorry! I didn't mean-
63	I just let my thoughts spill out\nof my mouth without thinking!
64	*cough*
65	My Prince?!
66	Um, what's happening?\nI, er, should I get help?
67	Pyra, you monster!\nYou're killing him here!
68	Who would have known that\nPyra could be so deeply cruel...
69	That wasn't my intention at all!\nI'm sorry!
70	I just thought that the joke\nwasn't up to your usual standard...
71	Ahck!
72	My Prince?!
73	A mortal blow. It's going to take him\nsome time to recover from that...
kizunatalk045_ms.json
1	Say, Mòrag, have you known\nZeke for a long time?
2	Indeed. We'd never spoken directly,\nbut I knew of him.
3	The Prince paid a visit to Mor Ardain,\ndid he not? It must have been not long\nafter his departure from Tantal.
4	Yes, now that you mention it...
5	What should I ask?
6	How was he, back then?
7	You weren't really interested, Mòrag?
8	Well, let's see...
9	As I recall, the guards reported\ncapturing a suspicious man, dressed\nall in black and with a funny accent.
10	That's right.\nThey'd stopped him at the palace gates\nand were about to throw him in jail.
11	He was already a shady customer\nback then, huh...?
12	It's a good thing the Prince was feeling\ngenerous, otherwise it could have been\na major diplomatic incident.
13	Most certainly. Thanks be to his\nforbearance.
14	That's just like Zeke, though.\nI can almost picture it now...
15	Teeheehee... That isn't even the worst\nof my Prince's heroic tales!
16	There are worse ones yet?
17	Oh yeah, loads!\nHe's pretty much misfortune on legs.
18	Like, when he visited Uraya, they\nmistook him for a rookie guard and\nmade us drill for 72 hours straight.
19	My Prince was happy as a clam,\nsaid it was a rare chance to see\nother countries' training regimens...
20	If you ask me though, it was\nbeyond awful.
21	The grub was worse than Armu kibble,\nand they didn't even have baths...
22	Calamity indeed.
23	Yet despite that treatment, he let it\npass without creating an uproar...
24	Quite the gracious personage, our Zeke.
25	Gracious? I think he was just doing\nwhatever he felt like...
26	I think you're being a bit\ntoo harsh on him there...
27	Honestly, I'm impressed by\nhow he never seems to be\nfazed by any situation!
28	If he heard you say that,\nI'm pretty sure he'd start bawlin'...
29	No, I was curious...
30	I had heard him praised as the\ngreatest Driver in Tantal, after all.
31	I would have liked to spar with him, but\nat the end of the day I had my duties...
32	I was curious about him myself...\nTruly, a shame.
33	And now?\nYou don't wanna spar anymore?
34	No...there is no need.
35	Now I can see him in action at my side.
36	And he is as reliable as they come.
37	Quite...
38	His personality may be somewhat\nunique, but his prowess cannot\nbe questioned.
39	Still, that's a shame...\nI would have liked to see\nthe two of you go at it!
40	Hmm...
41	Well, if the opportunity arises,\nI would not mind facing him.
42	Rivalry can benefit both parties.\nAnd it can only be helpful to grasp\none's allies' strengths and weaknesses.
43	Rex, a word of advice...\nTry not to egg Lady Mòrag on.\nShe tends to take people very seriously.
44	My bad...
kizunatalk047_ms.json
1	Who would've thought a place like this\nexisted under the Cloud Sea?
2	Yeah...
3	Us salvagers dive deep, but I've never\ndreamed there'd be this enormous\nspace down here.
4	You'd be hard-pressed finding another\nplace as vast as this, that's for sure.
5	Did people live here once, d'you think?
6	If the whole space is filled with\nbuildings like the ones around here...
7	There must've been a heck of a lot of\npeople living in them.
8	True, that.
9	And the number of people aside, can\nyou imagine the work it would take to\ncover this whole place in buildings?
10	I can hardly imagine...
11	I've salvaged a whole bunch of\ntreasures over the years with functions\nwe could never figure out...
12	If this world is where they came from,\nI've gotta say it makes sense.
13	In any age, the ambitions of men\nbuild civilization up, and those same\nambitions bring it crumbling down.
14	That's so tragic...
15	Hey, Rex.
16	Why is this place in ruins anyway...?
17	How should I respond?
18	Because of the Cloud Sea?
19	There must have been a war.
20	You think the Cloud Sea appeared one\nday and covered the whole thing up?
21	Yeah. The crops wouldn't have grown\nany more, so people would have had\nto leave.
22	And everyone would've wound up\nliving above the Cloud Sea instead.
23	Does that make sense?
24	I've got a feeling it's the\nother way round.
25	You're saying the Cloud Sea caused\nproblems here, so people wound up\nliving on the Titans.
26	But I think the problems here came\nfirst, and that's how the Cloud Sea\nand the Titans were made.
27	And once it became uninhabitable, they\nwent and made a new place to live.
28	Hmmm...
29	What do you think, Nia?
30	Well, let's see...
31	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Who freaking knows?!
32	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]I mean, this stuff must've happened\nmore than just centuries ago.\nHow're we meant to have any idea?
33	Well, that's why we're speculating,\nright?
34	Yeah, but I reckon it's a waste of time.
35	We still know barely anything about\nthis place. If we want to work stuff out,\nwe should search for more clues.
36	Well, that's a fair point.
37	I think you hit the nail on the head.\nSome terrible war sounds pretty likely.
38	But would a war cause THIS\nmuch devastation?
39	Maybe it was some\nnatural disaster or other?
40	Not out of the question, but a natural\ndisaster's not gonna level everything.\nIt wouldn't be this widespread.
41	Take a look outside. Ruin as far\nas the eye can see.
42	Hmmm...
43	You could say the same about war,\nthough.
44	What kind of a war could destroy\na city this big?
45	Maybe...they had some kind of\nincredible weapon we've never seen.
46	Or just one hell of a lot of 'em.
47	I hear a crazy number of Blades fought\nin the war 500 years ago.
48	You think something like that\nhappened before?
49	Hard to say for sure.
50	I think maybe we need to explore\na bit further.
51	This place is beyond anything we've\nimagined, after all.
52	To be honest, I think it's\nactually kind of exciting.
53	Can't deny it.
54	This world's a bigger place\nthan we knew.

1	Hey, baby. You're looking good.\nThat smile's worth a million G.
2	What? Are you talking to me?\nWhat a creep...
3	Aw, don't be like that...
4	Although, I kinda dig it\nwhen you call me names...
5	Leave me alone!
6	...Ugh.
7	You heard the lady. Cut it out, Mik.
8	What, Patroka? Why you gotta\nbutt in on my moment of sweet bliss?
9	Sweet? Oh please.\nShe looked ready to barf.
10	You sweet, naive girl.
11	She was just playing hard to get!\nGirls are cute like that.
12	...There's no helping your\nsick brain any more, is there.
13	Did you come all this way just to\nbother innocent women?
14	But of course. What about it?
15	I've heard this store is popular with\nthe ladies.
16	Ohhhhhh boy...
17	Now, listen. This is an important part\nof my quest for self-improvement.
18	This? So you're improving yourself\nto be an even bigger perv.
19	No no no, Patroka.
20	You know what makes a good man?\nA little attention from a good woman,\nthat's what.
21	Those ones aren't even giving you\nthe time of day, though.
22	Urk...
23	C'mon, Driver, back me up here!\nYou think I'm a good man, right?
24	How should I answer?
25	Yeah, you're a good man.
26	Um...not really.
27	What do I say?
28	Sure, why not. You're all right.
29	Um, how about no.
30	How shall I respond?
31	I think you're just fine.
32	I think not.
33	How do I reply?
34	You're a good bloke.
35	I'd have to say no.
36	See? Some people get it!
37	In fact, you've just won my heart.\nLet's get married, you and me!
38	You really will just take about\nanyone, huh?
39	That was a joke. Relax.
40	Seriously though, having a partner\nmakes all the difference, doesn't it?
41	I mean, look at Rex - he was just\na salvager, but now? Why, he's\nthe Aegis's Driver!
42	That's an extreme example...\nBut yeah, maybe you're not wrong.
43	Right?!
44	For us Blades, I think it's important\nto branch out. Just being buddy-buddy\nwith our Drivers can only get us so far.
45	There's plenty of areas where you can\nonly grow through contact with others,\ndon't you think?
46	Sure, I guess...
47	I'm so glad we've reached\nan understanding, Patroka!
48	...Uh-huh.
49	...Uhh?
50	But, uh...
51	Yeah?
52	What's that got to do\nwith you bein' a perv?
53	Ugh, she worked it out?!
54	I'm so done with you!
55	Those two make a nice pair.
56	They're so cute together.
57	They get along so well...
58	Thick as thieves, those two.
59	What?!
60	Saw it coming.
61	Driver...my Driver! I trusted you,\nand yet you repay me with heartless\nwords and wound my soul.
62	Patroka, let me seek comfort\nin your tender embrace!
63	Like hell!
64	Don't you reject me too!\nYou're basically the only one\nI have left here.
65	I told you to piss off!
66	Don't be so stubborn!
67	Who's being stubborn?!
68	I see.\nYou still think I'm joking, huh?
69	Well now...
70	To prove how serious I am...\nI will do anything you ask of me!
71	If you tell me not to pester other girls,\nI won't...
72	And if you tell me to learn to eat\nsour pickled plums, well, I'll surely try.
73	Come on, say it. Anything at all!\nMy seriousness is on the line.
74	...All right. Smash your Core Crystal\nup then, would you?
75	So harsh!
76	I thought you said you'd do anything?
77	Uh, I... That's...\na very...literal reading...
78	Oh, and here I thought\nyou were serious about me.
79	...I...\nI'm sorry.\nI may have taken it too far.
80	So you admit you were toying with me...
81	As punishment, you will be\nthe party packhorse!
82	That should give you time for\nself-improvement.
83	C'mon, Patroka...\nPleeeeeaseee...

1	Olethro Ruins are quite the stimulating\nlocation, wouldn't you agree?
2	There could be no better place to\nperform one of my scripts.
3	Though it is in a state of some\ndisrepair... Perhaps it needs a\nlittle fixing up.
4	Hey, Akhos.
5	How about you shut up\nand make dinner?
6	Trust me, you'll be more use to\neveryone cooking than writing those\nvapid scripts of yours.
7	How terribly rude.
8	What should I say?
9	What recipes are you good at?
10	I'm more interested in the scripts.
11	What should I say?
12	What kind of stuff can you cook?
13	Those scripts sound pretty interesting.
14	What shall I say?
15	Can you make any speciality dishes?
16	I find those scripts most intriguing.
17	What should I say?
18	So what kind of food can you make?
19	Those scripts have caught my interest.
20	Alas... I am surrounded by fools\nwho think only of their stomachs.
21	Ahahah! Well, can you blame us?
22	Your food's good! And scripts aren't\ngoing to make us any less hungry!
23	Though come to think of it,\nI'm not sure what kind of recipes\nyou're actually good at.
24	Everything you make's so delicious,\nI never paid much attention!
25	That would be because I specifically\ncooked all your favorite meals.
26	Huh. Who'd've thunk it.
27	Dear me... An artist is never\nappreciated in his own time.
28	At any rate, I'm afraid I don't have\nany particular specialties.
29	Though there is one thing\nI can't stand to cook.
30	The Argentum Monkfish.
31	I cannot begin to imagine how to\ncreate something appetizing from\nthat...grotesque form.
32	A single look at it makes me queasy.
33	Hold on. What do its looks\nhave to do with how it tastes?
34	Are you dense, girl? Aesthetic appeal\nis an integral part of the culinary arts!
35	How do you expect me to produce\na beautiful creation from such vile\nsubject matter?!
36	It is a menace! A slayer of appetites!\nNo sane person would wish to\npartake of it!
37	Its bloated protuberances, its clammy\nexterior... Even for a fish, it is hideous!
38	The mere thought of it sends\na shiver down my spine!
39	You're coming up with all kinds\nof fancy words there...
40	But basically, you just don't\nwant to touch it, right?
41	But of course!
42	Why should I befoul my artist's hands\nwith such an abomination?!
43	A fish Akhos won't touch, huh...\nMaybe we should ask Pyra to\ncook one up sometime.
44	Wha-?!
45	Well, even if you can't manage,\nAkhos, I bet Pyra could make a\ntasty meal out of it.
46	I...see...
47	When you put it that way, I feel\nperhaps it is time I took up this\nchallenge after all.
48	Oh? You'll cook one for us, then?
49	Yes...I can't be outdone by Pyra.\nMy pride will not allow it!
50	I can't wait to taste what\nyou come up with, Akhos!
51	Well, this ought to be fun.
52	I look forward to tasting\nyour creation, Akhos.
53	Well, this'll definitely\nbe worth a taste!
54	Hahah... Prepare to be amazed.
55	Thank goodness at least my Driver\npossesses some measure of taste.
56	I was actually just starting on a\nscript starring you as the hero...
57	But now, I think I will portray you yet\nmore flatteringly than I had intended.
58	You will be the finest of heroes,\nmaster of the pen and the sword alike!
59	Seriously? Have you forgotten who\nyou're talking about here?
60	Patroka... I will depict you as a\nworthless glutton with a fondness\nfor midday naps.
61	Wha-?!
62	Hey, I'm not worthless!
63	Sure, I procrastinate a bit sometimes,\nbut I kick ass when it counts!
64	True, but we have an entire\nparty of formidable fighters.
65	Including a worthless layabout girl\nwill add to the variety and make\nthe story much more entertaining.
66	That's fine, but you don't\nhave to model your worthless\nlayabout girl after me!
67	I want to give you your chance to shine,\nmy dear Patroka. It would be tragic\nif you were lost amongst the crowd.
68	Then give me a more shiny sort of role!
69	The role of worthless layabout glutton\nis not to your liking?
70	The role of worthless layabout glutton\nis to my extreme disliking!
71	I see...
72	Then Rex, I will give you the role of\nthe worthless layabout glutton instead.
73	How about no?!
74	Then Nia, I will give you the role of\nthe worthless layabout glutton instead.
75	Oh, HELL no.
76	Then Mòrag, I will give you the role of\nthe worthless layabout girl instead.
77	I fear I may be a little old for that\nposition. Besides which, would the plot\nprogress with a layabout for the hero?
78	Then Zeke, I will give you the role of\nthe worthless layabout glutton who is\npast his prime, instead.
79	Who're you calling past his prime?!\nAnd what kind of hero would that be?!
80	Dear me... You are all so picky.

1	Hey, you've gathered a pretty good\nbunch of firewood there.
2	We should be able to cook some\npretty tasty rice with this.
3	Cook...rice?
4	Well, yeah.
5	That's why I asked you to gather\nfirewood and find me a place for\na campfire.
6	What are we cooking rice for?
7	What're we cooking rice for?
8	For what reason are we cooking rice?
9	And what's all this rice cooking for?
10	What do you think it's for, genius?
11	To eat, of course!
12	Hey Akhos, you got everything ready?
13	Yes, yes... I have the equipment,\nthe spices and the script right here.
14	Huh? Wait, is Akhos doing the cooking?\nWhat about you, Patroka?
15	Heheh...\nI'm here for the eating!
16	Right. Of course you are.\nWhy did I even ask.
17	There's no point expecting my\nsister to be able to cook.
18	Outside of weapon collecting and\ntidying up, she has no skills whatsoever.
19	Shaddup, you. Less mouthing off\nand more rice cooking!
20	Yes, yes... Why must I be cursed\nwith such a domineering sister?
21	Though some would say\nthat's her best quality.
22	What should I say?
23	So what, are we eating...just rice?
24	Did you say she's good at...tidying up?
25	What should I say?
26	Uh, are we eating just rice? That's it?
27	Hang on, she's good at tidying up?
28	What shall I say?
29	Is this meal to consist of rice alone?
30	Did you say she is good at tidying up?
31	What should I say?
32	So we're having just rice? That's it?
33	Uh, what was that about tidying up?
34	Good point. Rice on its own is\nhardly a proper meal.
35	Oh, Mythra.\nYou're such a child sometimes.
36	Akhos, have you got the\nyou-know-what?
37	But of course. Right here.
38	Ooh yes, this is what I'm talking about!\nPickled to perfection!
39	What are these things?
40	Pickled plums!
41	Pickled...plums?
42	So they're edible...are they?
43	Pickled what?
44	Never heard of those before...
45	Pickled plums...?
46	What are those, exactly?\nSome kind of confection?
47	Pickled wha...?
48	Never heard of them.\nAre they for eating?
49	They are a kind of fruit, soaked\nover time in a saline solution.
50	What we do is, we wrap them up in\nthe sticky rice and make rice balls.
51	When the rice is freshly cooked,\nthey taste amazing!
52	Rice balls I've heard of, but are these\nshriveled things really edible?
53	Trust me, they're good.\nWanna try one?
54	Ewww, it's all soft and squishy...
55	Guehhhh! That's sour!
56	Water!\nGet me some water! Quick!
57	What ARE these things?!
58	Are you sure they're meant to be\nedible?! Are you trying to poison me?!
59	Ahahahahah!\nNah, they're not poisonous.
60	As it happens, they are rather healthy.\nThey have antibacterial properties.
61	Huh? Am I really the only one who\nappreciates the finer tastes in life?
62	Freshly cooked rice balls with\npickled plums, under the open sky...\nWhat could be better?!
63	How 'bout you, Driver?\nYou'll have one, right?
64	What's that face for? Does it surprise\nyou that tidying up is a skill of mine?
65	Well, um, frankly, yeah.
66	And what's that supposed to mean?!\nSo what if I'm a tidy person?!
67	Calm down, my dear Patroka.
68	This may surprise you all, but my sister\nis actually quite the orderly type.
69	She claims it irritates her to no end\nwhen things are left out of place.
70	She even lines up all the weapons\nshe collects in order of size.
71	She's a real stickler for these things.
72	Listen, Patroka.
73	Isn't it weird to be obsessive like\nthat when you're so...um...crude?
74	Excuse me?!
75	If it's a fight you're after,\nI'll give you one!
76	Oh, wait. I get it.\nI know what this is about.
77	You're the catastrophically\nuntidy type, aren't you?
78	I... I h-have no idea what\nyou're t-talking about!
79	Ohhhh yeah, I know your type.\nYou act all cute, but at home you\nturn every room into a den of trash.
80	Yeah, people like that are the worst.
81	My Driver will agree with me\non that one - right?
82	What? Um, I... I guess...
83	I do prefer people to tidy up\nafter themselves...
84	Well, no one likes a messy type.
85	Not that I can exactly talk\non that front.
86	I must say I agree.
87	A lack of organization in one's\nday-to-day life is a sign of a\ntroubled mind.
88	Well, yeah... I guess...
89	I'd probably be keener on a girl\nwho could clean up after herself.
90	Sh-shut up!\nDon't answer the question seriously!
91	So, Mythra. Ready to admit\nwho's in the wrong here?
92	If you apologize now, I might be willing\nto give you a few tidiness pointers!
93	Not in a million years!
94	Ahahahah!\nWell, don't come crying to me\nwhen Rex gives up on you!
95	Grrr...
kizunatalk051_ms.json
1	Oh my!\nSuch a wonderful place!
2	The lady at the inn sure knows her\nstuff!
3	Yes, indeed...\nI must admit, it's a dramatic scene.
4	Looking at it is like a spur to my\ncreative energy.
5	Akhos...\nYou think you'll write another play?
6	Perhaps. Gazing out at a vista like this...\nIt's like a churning sea of possibilities.
7	I mean, for example...
8	A story of a woman...who took to the\nskies on wings of freedom.
9	Sounds way interesting!\nI wanna hear more!
10	Akhos! You must write that story!\nI can't bear it if you don't!
11	Obrona... It's easier said than done.\nIdeas need to crystallize a little first.
12	But... Perhaps you could be my\ninspiration for this story?
13	Inspiration?
14	I mean...because you fly on wings of\nfreedom.
15	You're wild and untameable.\nAnd you've already got wings.
16	Oh... Am I now...?
17	Why don't you try flying a little\nfor me now? Right here?
18	Yes!\nOf course!
19	What should I say to Obrona?
20	Flying? From here?\nWait, can you actually fly?!
21	It's true that you're quite the free spirit.
22	What should I say to Obrona?
23	Flying? From here?\nI didn't think you could fly...
24	You're my kind of girl, Obrona. Living\nyour own way.
25	What shall I say to Obrona?
26	You're thinking of flying from here?\nI didn't even know you could fly.
27	You're a free spirit, Obrona. I like that.
28	What should I say to Obrona?
29	What? You want to fly from here?\nYou can fly? Way cool.
30	You don't let reality hold you back.\nI guess you're a free spirit like me.
31	Heh? You really didn't know I could\nfly? So very silly!
32	...
33	Well, it's not as though she has real\nflight, like a bird flapping its wings.
34	It's more like floating around on the\nether flow. Those wing-like organs\nlet her manipulate it.
35	But unlike real flight, it's not affected\nby wind or weather, so I can go\nwherever I like!
36	So they really are wings of freedom!
37	Hey, Obrona, here's an idea...\nWhy don't you try taking to the\nskies with your Driver?
38	With my Driver?\nBut, Drivers can't fly!
39	Can't you bear them up in your arms?
40	The heroine in my story was going to\nsoar the heavens with her loyal\ncompanion.
41	That'd be incredibly dramatic, don't\nyou think?
42	Now that you mention it...yes!
43	If you want to take to the skies on\nObrona Airways, just call me!
44	Ah...I'm OK for now...
45	Hmmm...nah...
46	No, I don't think so.
47	I laugh in the face of danger! But, no\nthanks.
48	What? No?!\nYou trembling mouse!
49	I promise to try not to drop you!\nI'm not all that clumsy, you know!
50	Hey, wait a moment.
51	That would be even more dramatic.\nThe heroine drops her friend...\nOh, the pathos!
52	Yes, the muses have called out to me,\nand I've heard!
53	?!
54	So, she will drop her friend?
55	That's right. Her companion will be\ndashed on the rocks below, like a bag\nof wet rice.
56	Now come on, Obrona. It's time you\ntried taking your Driver for a spin!
57	Reach the highest peak, then let them\ngo, into the Cloud Sea below!
58	OK!\nSounds like a great idea!
59	Obrona! You'd better be joking!
60	Hey, not so fast! I wouldn't want to fly\nwithout Dromarch.
61	There's no way you can hold up me\nand furbag here.
62	Wait a moment!
63	...I...just remembered something I have\nto do. Very urgent imperial business!
64	W-whoa there!
65	Wouldn't you rather take Akhos?\nI mean, you'd cramp my style.
66	Come on, this isn't an offer that one\ncan refuse. I'm writing the ultimate\ncomedy here. Your help is appreciated.
67	No doubt about it! I can't miss out on\nthe chance to be immortalized in one of\nyour tales, Akhos.
68	Of course I am!\nI'm the very picture of freedom!
69	Although...sometimes I wonder whether\nwhat I have is actually real freedom.
70	?
71	I mean, a Blade always shares\nthe fate of their Driver, right?
72	Doesn't that mean we're kind of\ntied down by our Drivers?
73	You can hardly call that freedom.
74	Obrona, you surprise me.
75	What? How?
76	That's awfully insightful. It seems the\ngenius of my story has inspired you in\nturn.
77	I always thought that you were just\nfired by raw, unthinking desires and\nwhimsical emotion.
78	Akhos! You're skating on thin ice!
79	I'm actually very thoughtful...\nunderneath...
80	Like, uh...say I've got some of my\nfavorite Tantalese Porridge here.
81	And let's say...Rex is about to eat it.
82	And let's say...Nia is about to eat it.
83	And let's say...Mòrag is about to eat it.
84	And let's say...Zeke is about to eat it.
85	My stomach says, "eat it!"... But my\nconscience says, "let my Driver have it."
86	Real freedom is being able to choose\nwhether I sit back and let them eat it,\nor ask them to let me have some.
87	And that choice is up to me, Obrona.\nSo in a way, I'm the Driver of me!
88	Being able to choose...\nthat's real freedom!
89	Yes. You can make choices. And those\nchoices lead to consequences.
90	All of that is under your control.
91	Although... I have to say I can't picture\nyou making either of those choices.
92	If I was to bet on it, I'd have said you'd\nhave punched your Driver and taken\nall the grub for yourself.
93	Would you really consider any\nother option?
94	Eheheh... Realistically, that probably\nis what I'd decide to go for...
95	But in the end, that just means\nyou're being selfish!
96	Hang on, doesn't that just mean\nyou're being selfish?!
97	But in the end, that simply means\nyou're being selfish!
98	Hold it. Doesn't that just mean\nyou're being selfish?!
99	W-well... Choosing to be selfish\nis a kind of freedom too!
100	Not being tied down by anything...\nLiving for myself...
101	Not doing anything nasty and boring!\nOnly doing fun things!
102	That's the sort of life I want!
103	...
104	Yes, yes... You're the ideal inspiration\nfor my free-spirited heroine...
105	This is going to be the greatest comedy\nof all time!
106	Well, that settles it. I'll keep doing\nwhatever I want! Otherwise Akhos's\nstory would be ruined!
kizunatalk052_ms.json
1	Ahahah. Ahh, this is the life. The wind\non your face, the air in your lungs...
2	It feels like freedom! This kind of place\nmakes you glad to be alive.
3	What are you saying? You talk like you\naren't always free to do as you please.
4	Hissss! Issss something wrong with your\neyes? Does this look like freedom\nto you?
5	Following a group of brats and Nopon\nlike a teacher on a school outing?
6	You do it because you like them, right?
7	*cackle* LIKE them?\nI do it because I have no choice!
8	Gahaha!
9	You seem to enjoy it anyway!
10	Maybe something IS\nwrong with your eyes!
11	You're pretty talkative today, Sever.
12	You're talkative today, Sever.
13	You're rather talkative today, Sever.
14	You're jolly talkative today, Sever.
15	You think? Hehe...\nI suppose I'm just in a good mood.
16	Talkative or not, I'm always keeping\na watchful eye over everyone.
17	Hah, good one! More like you're\nalways wandering around doing\nyour own thing!
18	You've always got something to\nshout back at me, haven't you?
19	Waaah!
20	Let's ask Sever something.
21	Do you dislike having to\nworry about others?
22	Why do you prefer being alone?
23	Let's ask Sever something.
24	Do you hate being around us?
25	Why do you prefer being alone?
26	Let's ask Sever something.
27	Do you hate caring for others?
28	Why do you prefer your own company?
29	Let's ask Sever something.
30	Do you just hate other people?
31	Why d'you like doing your own thing?
32	Hmph, well to be honest I've never\nliked being part of a large group.
33	Others are just an unnecessary burden.
34	So we should just leave you behind?\nYou'd be lost without us, admit it!
35	It's important that your Driver\nbe able to keep an eye on you.
36	How rude... Jerk.
37	Why don't we leave YOU behind? I'm\nsure it would be fun to watch you rage.
38	Waaaah!\nYou wouldn't do that!
39	Ahaha, you guys argue so much\nbut I can tell you're good friends.
40	Ahaha, you guys argue so much\nbut I can tell you're good friends.
41	Heh, you guys argue so much\nbut in truth you're good friends.
42	You fellas argue so much, but you're\nreally good friends, aren't ya?
43	What?\nAre you serious?
44	This oaf is no friend of mine!
45	At least we agree on something! I'd\nrather be friends with an Igna!
46	Yeah? You're one to talk, you\nGogol-faced buffoon!
47	Waaaah!\nI'm stronger than a Gogol!
48	Oh. Whatever you say.
49	At any rate, I'm just going to\ncontinue doing as I please.
50	As long as I find this place tolerable,\nI'll keep on lending my services to you.
51	I expect the same from you, Driver.
52	Alone is just easier.\nNobody to burden you.
53	Besides, the phrase "lone wolf"\nhas something of a ring to it.
54	You're a Blade, though.\nYou can't just survive\non your own like that.
55	You don't think I know that?
56	Do you feel like we're\nholding you back?
57	So you feel like we're\njust holding you back.
58	You mean to say that we\nare just holding you back?
59	What, so we're just holding you back?
60	Hmm?\nNo, not at all!
61	No need to go cry about it.
62	It's all fine. I don't have any particular\nobjection to being around you.
63	And I certainly don't feel held back.
64	If anything, it's rather enjoyable...\nHehehe...
65	It's as Cressidus says.\nWithout a Driver, I\ncannot continue living.
66	I envy those who are able to live alone.
67	That's all I meant.
68	You don't need to concern\nyourselves over me. Got it?
69	Gahaha!\nYou're a character, Sever.
70	Shut up, you!\nThat counts as concerning yourself!
kizunatalk053_ms.json
1	Man, what a view...\nI like this boat.
2	Oh? I didn't know you were interested\nin Titan battleships, Mikhail.
3	I don't much care about the Titan part,\nbut the tech element I find fascinating.
4	Don't you get excited just looking at it?
5	I just want to tinker with it all.
6	Gimme a hand, will ya, Cressidus?
7	Yes! Let me at it!
8	What should I say to Cressidus?
9	You must be great at carrying stuff.
10	Are you good with your hands?
11	What do I say to Cressidus?
12	I bet you're good at heavy lifting.
13	Are you good with your hands, then?
14	What shall I say to Cressidus?
15	You seem well-suited to manual labor.
16	Are you in fact surprisingly dextrous?
17	What'll I say to Cressidus?
18	You do a lot of heavy lifting, am I right?
19	You good with your hands, then?
20	Are you makin' fun of me?
21	I mean, sure, I have muscles.
22	Anyone who's not blind can see that!
23	Well, yeah, but...
24	Yeah, but...
25	That is true, but...
26	Guess so...
27	Tell you what, if you're so interested\nin my strength, why don't I give you\na little demonstration?
28	Let's see...
29	What if I lifted that Titan battleship?!
30	Wha-?!
31	Huh?!
32	How-?!
33	Whuh?!
34	I...don't think that's possible.
35	Gahahaha!
36	Yeah, you're right.
37	But I could probably manage\nArchelon over there!
38	Cressidus, how about no.
39	If you break Ardainian hardware,\nwe'll all be paying for it.
40	Hmph... Why does that sound\nlike a familiar story?
41	Then how about something like this?
42	Driver-throwing!
43	I bet I can throw mine farther\nthan anyone else!
44	Good idea, that.
45	I'm sure the Ardainian military won't\nmind that, at least.
46	Gahaha!
47	It's on, then!\nLet's do it!
48	No, ah...\nHold on a second...
49	Hold up!\nHold the hell up!
50	Wait, please, let's not\ndo anything rash-
51	Hang on!\nYou can't-
52	Ah, shaddup and watch!
53	Putting your life in your Blade's hands\nis what Drivers do!
54	Hngggh! Hyaaaaahhhh!
55	Aaaaaaah-!
56	Nooooo-!
57	Urghhh-!
58	I hate youuuuuuuuuu!
59	Phew...\nI thought I'd die.
60	I think it's probably best not to mention\nCressidus's strength in future...
61	Phew...\nI'm so glad I'm alive...
62	Let's maybe not talk to Cressidus about\nphysical strength, like, ever again...
63	Ah...\nA narrow escape...as it were.
64	I think I will refrain from mentioning\nphysical strength to Cressidus again...
65	Fwoosh...\nI nearly wet myself...
66	Let's maybe not talk to Cressidus\nabout physical strength...ever again.
67	Oh, absolutely.\nCressidus is pretty damn skillful.
68	Heh! Sure am! Don't look it, do I?
69	Well, when it comes to tiny screws\nfor tiny Nopon hands, I admit I get\nfurious sometimes.
70	But anything else, and I'm your man.
71	And when it comes to the fiddly parts,\nthat's where I step in.
72	I see!
73	Mikhail takes care of the small things,\nand Cressidus focuses on the big...
74	A perfect match-up!
75	Gotcha.
76	Mikhail takes care of the little things,\nand Cressidus the big ones...
77	Good combo, that!
78	I see.
79	Mikhail takes care of the fine points,\nwhile Cressidus focuses on the large...
80	A good pairing.
81	Huh!
82	So Mikhail does the little bits,\nand Cressidus does the bigger ones...
83	Nice combo!
84	It is, isn't it...
85	Gahaha!
86	Yeah! Together we're unstoppable!

1	Tell me, good sir, is this the\nextent of your wares?
2	Sure is. What you see is what you get.
3	Alas... It seems the treasures I seek\nare nowhere to be found.
4	On another weapon shopping\nspree, Perdido?
5	That is hardly an accurate assessment.
6	Unlike you, I am not in the habit\nof purchasing every weapon that\nI set eyes upon.
7	Hey, I have some standards too,\nyou know!
8	You are too flighty, Patroka.\nAt least try to give each weapon\nthe attention it deserves.
9	Oh, shut up...
10	I'm not the one with four arms\nand a weapon in each!
11	Hmm.
12	What should I ask Perdido?
13	Which weapon do you like the most?
14	Don't you use any projectiles?
15	What should I ask Perdido?
16	Which weapon's your favorite?
17	Don't you use any projectiles?
18	What shall I ask Perdido?
19	Which weapon most appeals to you?
20	Do you not use any projectiles?
21	What should I ask Perdido?
22	What weapon d'you like best?
23	Don't you use any projectiles?
24	My preferred weapon...?
25	Hmm... I think I have none.
26	I could not call myself a warrior\nif I discriminated between the\ntools at my disposal.
27	The spear... The axe... The sword...\nThe hammer...
28	A true warrior should be able to wield\nall with equal proficiency.
29	Each weapon has its strengths\nand its weaknesses.
30	As a wielder of four weapons, my\ngreatest strength is that I can use\nwhichever the situation calls for.
31	Mastering four different weapon styles?
32	You really are serious about the\nart of battle, Perdido. I don't think\nmany people could do that.
33	Mastering four different weapons, huh?
34	Talk about the heart of a warrior.\nYou're something else, Perdido.
35	Seeking mastery over four disparate\nweapons?
36	Truly, you are a warrior to the core.\nI admire your conviction, Perdido.
37	Mastering four different weapons, eh?
38	I guess you're not kidding about this\ntrue warrior thing. That's no easy feat!
39	It is not an easy path, for certain.
40	But I believe with enough strength\nof will, nothing is impossible.
41	Come, I will show you how it is done!
42	Wow...
43	Well, good luck with that.\nGlad I'M not this guy's Driver.
44	What do you mean by that, Patroka?\nNaturally you will train with us too!
45	Whaaa?!\nWhat have I got to do with this?!
46	Enough of your whining!
47	We begin training right here, right now!\nHurry and make preparations!
48	Training isn't gonna give me four arms,\nyou know! I'm not doing it! No way!
49	Projectiles? They are the\ndomain of my Driver.
50	Uh, I don't think you're quite\ngetting the point.
51	You give your Driver a projectile\nto use, then you don't use any\nyourself? What's up with that?
52	It's your own weapon,\nwhy don't YOU try using it?
53	...
54	...It does not suit my style.
55	As a warrior, I prefer to confront\nmy foes directly, man-to-man.
56	Jeez, you're like a child sometimes...
57	What do you even say to that?
58	That's so like you, Perdido.
59	I can just see you locking eyes with\nthe enemy in a clash of blades.
60	That's just you all over, eh, Perdido?
61	Locking blades with the foe, staring\n'em in the eye...suits you to a tee.
62	Everyone has their own style.
63	I'm sure you prefer to lock eyes with\nyour foe as you battle, right, Perdido?
64	Hey, if that's your thing, Perdido!
65	I get the desire to lock blades with\na fearsome foe. Talk about intense!
66	Ah, my Driver. You understand\nme so well.
67	Seriously, though?
68	I mean, what kind of fair fight is it when\none guy has four arms, anyway?!
69	Hmm. You may be right.
70	But such physical advantages are\nnot necessarily a guarantee of skill.
71	Even four arms, if used ineffectively,\ncan be no match for a single blade.
72	And a true master of the warrior's\narts can defeat multiple armed foes\nwith his bare hands alone.
73	It comes down to a question of how\nfar one is willing to hone oneself.
74	That is why the path of the warrior\nis so difficult, yet so rewarding.
75	Sounds right!
76	Right on!
77	I agree completely.
78	True enough.
79	Oh, come on! You're just going\nto go with that excuse?!
80	This guy is SO against the rules!

1	Oh, His Majesty is absent...
2	A shame. You were hoping to\nmeet him again, weren't you?
3	It feels a little strange for me to\nthink of it as "again," but I did\nwish to meet with him, yes.
4	I remember the old you, standing\ntranquilly beside the throne...
5	Quiet, and resolved.
6	I can sense it is\na good memory for you...
7	I had hoped some memory might linger\nwithin you too, but alas. It seems not.
8	So it would appear...
9	Unlike you, Brighid, I did not have\npast records to fall back on.
10	Without any data, it is difficult to feel\nany emotional connection either.
11	And now you're prohibited\nfrom reading those records\nthat do exist, as well...
12	So I am, so I am...
13	Therefore I know not what I had been\ndoing, nor what my role is in the\nArdainian Empire.
14	I can comprehend some of it by talking\nwith you or Mòrag, but I feel sure there\nis much of importance I do not grasp.
15	Hence my plan: to ask Emperor Niall\nwhy it was that he forbade me from\nreading the past records.
16	Do you have any idea what the\nreason might be?
17	I wonder...
18	Why would he place such a restriction?
19	As a sign of demotion.
20	So I'd save the world, not the Empire.
21	From what I hear, it seems I failed\nto keep the Emperor safe, yes?
22	In which case, might it not mean I have\nbeen relieved of the duty to protect\nHis Majesty?
23	That's very pessimistic.
24	You always are too hard on\nyourself, Aegaeon.
25	I think Emperor Niall was hoping you\nwould protect Alrest, and not just him.
26	Rather than keep someone as excellent\nas you cooped up in Mor Ardain...
27	he preferred to have you contribute to\nthe well-being of the world at large.
28	Hm. I see...
29	He thought my knowing my past role\nin Mor Ardain would hinder that...
30	That's what I think.
31	This may be presumptuous\nto suggest, but...
32	He may have thought that I should\nwork for the good of Alrest, rather\nthan just for the Empire?
33	You mean, that an adept Blade should\nserve the world, not a single country?
34	Yes, precisely.
35	You can be quite brazen sometimes.
36	I was hesitant to say it myself...
37	But I do think you're probably right.
38	That's why the Emperor didn't want\nyou to know too much about your\nrole here.
39	He feared if you did, it may hinder you\nfrom achieving that purpose.
40	I see...
41	I may not have been able to meet\nthe Emperor, but just talking to you,\nBrighid, has given me strength.
42	Always glad to help.
43	For what it's worth, I can't wait for the\nday when you're back by the side\nof the throne.
44	Are you worried for him?
45	Maybe somewhat.
46	Anyone can aid the Emperor in his\nduties, but to keep him safe takes\nsomeone truly special.
47	Up until now, I felt secure knowing\nthat His Majesty was protected by\nmyself, Lady Mòrag, and you.
48	Certainly...\nThe sooner things fall back into place,\nthe better.
49	When all is said and done, I will\nreturn to the throne room...
50	You and me both, Brighid.\nWe will help see this through.
51	Right.\nI'll be counting on you.

1	Oh! Look at the size of this crevasse!
2	Who'd have thought Genbu Drifts\nwould be so high up?
3	Say, how do you think it formed?
4	How should I reply?
5	I heard from Gramps that someone\nmade it by punching the ground.
6	Maybe the Titan moved?
7	How should I reply?
8	Maybe someone punched the ground?
9	Maybe the Titan moved?
10	How should I respond?
11	Perhaps someone punched the ground?\nI have heard talk of such things...
12	Perhaps the Titan moved?
13	How should I answer?
14	I reckon someone punched the ground!
15	I reckon the Titan moved!
16	What, really?
17	It'd never happen if I'd used\nCold Judgment.
18	You're saying my power isn't up\nto scratch? Guess there's always\nsomeone stronger, huh.
19	...
20	Why the silent treatment?
21	Hold on, was that meant to be a joke?!
22	I'm a straightforward sort of Blade.\nDon't go confusing me with your\nstrange sense of humor.
23	Still, if I had the power to create rifts\nlike that...
24	We'd be right in the middle of\nGenbu right about now.
25	Titans must generate a massive amount\nof energy as they move.
26	Makes sense, considering how\nenormous their bodies are.
27	If I could gain the strength to rival\na Titan's in motion...
28	I would be able to crush evil where it\nspawns with a flaming fist of justice!
29	Wouldn't that be glorious?
30	Good to see you're still as peppy as\never, Godfrey.
31	Good to see you're as intense as\nalways, Godfrey.
32	I see you're still as spirited as ever,\nGodfrey.
33	Glad to see you're as fiery as ever,\nGodfrey!
34	But of course! The world may change,\nbut my heart and my fists remain\nconstant!
35	To save a person is to save them\nfrom their own weak selves.
36	If I failed, then my whole\nexistence would be meaningless!
37	No, my heart and my fists forge ever\nonwards, burning with justice!
38	But your fists are made of ice, aren't\nthey?
39	Uhm, aren't your fists made of ice,\nthough?
40	It only just struck me now, but aren't\nyour fists made of ice, not fire?
41	They're burning all right, but looking\nclosely, isn't that ice?
42	Huh?
43	...Wait, hold on a moment.
44	You're right... Why are they ice?
45	It's weird that I'd be using\nanything other than fire...
46	I'm always burning with passion, after\nall! What the heck?
47	Uh, I'm not really the best person to\nask...
48	Uh, I'm not really the best person to\nask...
49	I'm afraid that's something I can't\nanswer.
50	Heck if I know...
51	All right. There's only one answer.
52	Listen carefully, Driver.
53	My fists are not made of ice. They\nare blue flames!
54	You see? You can make out the outline\nand everything! Mystery solved! Done!
55	You get it? They're blue flames!\nFlames! You got that?!
56	Bit of a stretch, don't you think?
57	Kind of a stretch, don't you think?
58	Comparing you to Brighid, I think\nthat's something of a stretch...
59	Honestly, mate, that's a bit of\na stretch...
60	I don't care! From a distance, they\nlook like flames, OK?!
61	Good! From now on, you may address\nme as Godfrey of the Blue Flame!

2	Wulfric?\nWhat big voice about?
3	Seem to be getting very worked up\nfor something! What Wulfric planning?
4	I want to talk more...with others.
5	But everyone is scared of me...
6	I am not a scary person...\nI want them to see that.
7	Wulfric is kind Blade who doesn't\neven crush ants on path!
8	Yeah, it's a good idea to talk to people\nif you want them to understand you.
9	I'm sure people will get the message\nyou're a big softy if you talk a bit more.
10	A solid plan. I'm sure people will\nunderstand once they get to know you.
11	Yeah, good thinking. Chat to people\na bit more, let them see the real you.
12	Maybe talking hard for Wulfric, though.\nGrowling more normal for him.
13	Yes... Everyone runs from my voice.\nThat is the problem.
14	How can I fix this?
15	Uhm...
16	How about you help out that crying\nkid?
17	Well, looks like a senior citizen's in\ntrouble over there. You could help her?
18	Let's think...
19	Hey, why don't you go and help that\nsqualling brat over there?
20	That old fogey's in a spot of bother.\nWhy don't you go and help her?
21	Hmmmm...
22	Why don't you help that crying child\nover there?
23	Why don't you assist that elderly\nwoman over there?
24	Lessee now...
25	That lil' ankle-biter over there's doing\nmy nut in. Why don't you go help 'em?
26	That old bat's struggling a bit.\nWhy don't you go and help her out?
27	Good idea!
28	By helping someone, Wulfric show\neveryone big soft pulpy heart!
29	Hahaha! I can do that...\nWulfric to the rescue!
30	Tora, will you join me?
31	Tora's pleasure!
32	Waaaaa!\nUwaaaa!
33	What wrong?\nWhy all crying?
34	*sob*\nI dunno where my mum is...
35	You're lost?
36	Wah!\nA-a monster!
37	No! No monster!
38	Maybe look like monster.\nBut not nasty like monster!
39	Please, do not be afraid.\nI will not eat you!
40	*sob*
41	Wulfric... Maybe you make it worse\nwith that talk.
42	Oh. Sorry...\nTora, you look after the child.
43	I will look for the mother!
44	Hey!\nWhat are you doing to my child?!
45	Ah? This is your child?
46	Help! Help!\nMonster!
47	Monster...?\nNo! No no no... I'm not...
48	Someone help! This great big brute's\ngonna eat my baby!
49	No! Ah!
50	Not a monster! I'm a Blade!\nA Blade!!!
51	Wulfric... Please calm down...
52	Wargh! There's a monster in the village!\nSomeone come quick!
53	Hrrahh...\nArrooooo!
54	Waaargh!
55	No, Wulfric!
56	You make all scared with big voice!
57	Mummy!
58	Janny! Get out of here!
59	Ah, it hopeless.
60	Urgh...\nSorry... Again, I failed...
61	Hey, don't beat yourself up about it.\nYou didn't mean it.
62	Maybe you just need to let people get\nto know you more slowly.
63	Hey, don't take it so hard.\nYou messed up 'cos you were daft,\nnot 'cos you did anything bad.
64	Sometimes these things take time.
65	You shouldn't react so negatively to\nfailure. You didn't choose to fail.
66	Think of it as the first step on a long\npath.
67	Come on, dude. No need to be sporting\na downer mug like that. You didn't\ndo it on purpose.
68	We just need to get everyone used to\nyour mad ways in their own time.
69	Thank you...
70	I will not give up.
71	One day, I will make friends with\neveryone!
72	Very good!
73	Maybe if Wulfric does nice thing for\nsomeone, people know Wulfric nice!
74	Tora will tag along!
75	Hehe. Yeah!
76	Ahhh...
77	You okay, old lady?
78	Ah, I've been trying to get back 'ome.\nBut me knees are right done in.
79	Me eyes aren't up to much either.\nIf I get a bit out of breath, I can't\nsee a blessed thing.
80	Oh! Ah... Madam!\nLet me help you!
81	Oh, thank you so much, young man.\nI'm much obliged.
82	OK to walk?
83	Yes, I think I can manage that...
84	Oh?\nWhat's this 'ere?
85	Funny place to put a rock!
86	Ah no, that's...part of my body...
87	Ooh my! What a burly gent I'm getting\nwalked home by! The neighbors'll be\ntalking!
88	Madam...watch your step!
89	What the bloody 'ell's that thing!
90	A bloody monster's what it is!
91	Oh, sounds like there's a bit of a\ncommotion.
92	It is nothing.\nJust...some monster.
93	Ooh, I don't like the sound of that.\nLet's get 'ome quick!
94	Do not worry, Madam.\nI will protect you.
95	Oh, my hero!\nI don't doubt it!
96	This is where you live?
97	Yes, this is my humble abode.\nThank you so much, young man.
98	Will you tell me your name?
99	I am...Wulfric.
100	Oh, that's a funny name...\nBut thank you, Mr. Wulfric!

1	Perceval, if I may ask...\nWhat are you looking at from\na place like this?
2	I see the city.
3	Well, yes, I can see that...\nIs there something there?
4	...The lights.
5	The lights?
6	Points of warmth shining in the cold\nhushed darkness, signifying life.
7	Each of them the mark of a human\nsoul, living its life in this city.
8	And yet... How many of those\nlives can be happy ones...?
9	You sound like a poet sometimes,\nyou know that, Perceval?
10	You sound like a poet sometimes,\nyou know that, Perceval?
11	Perceval... The things you say sound\nalmost like poetry sometimes.
12	You sound like a poet sometimes,\nyou know that, Perceval?
13	I, a poet?
14	I merely state what I see before me.\nI do not mean to sound cryptic.
15	...
16	Maybe I should ask something.
17	Why is it you don't kill?
18	Why do you help people?
19	I'll try asking something.
20	Why don't you kill?
21	Why do you help people?
22	Perhaps I should ask something.
23	Why is it you refuse to kill?
24	Why do you help people?
25	I think I'll ask something.
26	So how come you don't kill?
27	So how come you help people?
28	A fitting question.
29	Rather than strike down the wicked,\nI prefer to strike down the wickedness\nin their hearts.
30	As such, though I do not take\nthe lives of men...
31	It is not out of mercy or compassion.
32	Rather, death is too easy a way out.
33	Way out?
34	To strike down an evildoer is to take\ntheir life as payment for their sins, yes?
35	But I do not feel sins can be\npaid for so easily.
36	To carry on living and atoning... As\npenance, it is more fitting than death.
37	That is why I do it. Because I believe\nsins should be atoned for.
38	Living is harder than dying...?
39	You really are a poet, Perceval!
40	Living is harder than dying...?
41	You really are a poet, Perceval!
42	Living is harder than dying...?
43	Truly you are a poet, Perceval.
44	Living is harder than dying...?
45	You really are a poet, Perceval!
46	Oh, I am no poet...
47	I am but one Blade.
48	I hope you'll join me in cutting down\nevildoers when the time comes.
49	...A difficult question.
50	To make the world a better place...\nThat would be an easy answer to give.
51	But I do not pursue such lofty goals.
52	Why do you do it, then? Saving people,\njust like that time recently...
53	Many would claim all people are equal,\nbut it does not seem that way to me.
54	The rules that govern this world are\nstill unjust and crooked...
55	The weak are abused by the strong,\nwho bend morality and law to evil ends.
56	I find such acts distasteful, so I\nprefer to side with those in need.
57	It is as simple as that.
58	So you just want to help people when\nyou see them suffering, is that it?
59	That sounds like a long and difficult\nroad to travel, but I'll walk it with you!
60	So you just can't stand by and\nwatch people suffer, eh?
61	That's a nice attitude. Especially\nif you really manage to live by it.
62	In other words, you guard the weak\nagainst the strong?
63	That stance agrees with me.\nI look forward to the work we'll do.
64	So you strike down evildoers just\n'cos it's the right thing to do?
65	Nice and simple.\nThat suits me fine!
66	Hahaha...
67	That means a lot. It's thanks to you that\nI can continue walking my path.
68	So I thank you, my Driver.\nI will be counting on you.

3	Gorg, do you really expect us to\nhold a strategy meeting here?
4	Hey, Gorg. Are you really planning\non having a strategy meeting here?
5	I thought perhaps it would be nice\nto have a change of scenery.
6	Now, let's start off by considering\nour past battle experiences.
7	Having analyzed our battles thus far,\nI've come to a conclusion.
8	Considering we have five Drivers\non our team, we ought to think\nmore about our formation.
9	Tora get it.
10	Tora so busy working with Poppi,\nnot have time to think about teamwork\nwith Rex-Rex and friends!
11	Indeed. Synergy between Blades\nand Drivers is important, but it can\nonly get you so far.
12	Gorg saying we should think about\nsynergy between Driver and Driver?
13	Ahh...?!
14	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Wh-what... What is that,\nover on the other table?!
15	[ML:Feeling ]Meh-meh? What wrong with Gorg?
16	Hmm? Ah, no, it's nothing.
17	As I was saying, we must consider the\nimportance of the Driver's actions in\nco-ordination with-
18	Wha?!
19	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]That woman over there... She's...\nShe's eating a dessert I've never\nseen before!
20	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]It looked like some kind of sweet\npastry, but it contained...
21	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Fruit?!
22	What should I say?
23	Is that woman distracting you?
24	Is our current teamwork that messy?
25	What should I say?
26	Is that woman distracting you?
27	Is our strategy just that awful?
28	What would be the best thing to say?
29	The woman over there distracts you?
30	Is our current strategy that flawed?
31	What should I say to him?
32	Is that woman distracting you?
33	Is our teamwork that lousy?
34	No...no, it's nothing. There's no\nneed to concern yourselves.
35	Gorg really staring a lot though!
36	But Tora maybe notice same thing\nGorg notice.
37	Tora have feeling Tora seen\nthat lady somewhere before.
38	Maybe she spy following us?!
39	No, really, that's really not the case!\nShe has nothing to do with this.
40	Meh-meh?
41	Then what's wrong?
42	So what's the deal?
43	Then what is the matter?
44	So what're you staring for?
45	It's...the dessert.
46	Dessert? What Gorg mean?
47	I...I couldn't help noticing the\ndessert that woman was eating.
48	What, that all? Gorg should have said\nearlier!
49	Tora want to eat scrummy food too!\nWe all order dessert now?!
50	All right, all right.
51	Why don't we all discuss our battle\nplans over some dessert?
52	All right already.
53	Why don't we all discuss our battle\nplans over some dessert?
54	You leave me no choice.
55	We will simply have to order dessert\nand eat as we discuss our strategies.
56	All right, we get it.
57	Why don't we all discuss our battle\nstrategies over some dessert?
58	In that case, I'll have three of what\nshe's having. If you're OK with that.
59	(REMOVED)
60	Ah, no, it's nothing like that...
61	It wasn't any of your fault, I was just-
62	Ahhhh!
63	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]I knew it!\nIt is indeed a fruit filling!
64	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]And bathed in some liquid, no less...\nbut what is it? Honey?! Fruit juice?!
65	[ML:Feeling ]What is Gorg doing?
66	Mmmmmwhat?
67	Oh, my apologies.\nWhere were we again?
68	Ah yes, I have a proposition. I suggest\nin future, we arrange our units as\nfollows, so that-
69	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Oh, my word!
70	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Can it be true? There is something\nmore than just fruit contained within\nthat crispy exterior?
71	[ML:Feeling ]It's...it's cream!
72	But what kind of cream?
73	Gaaah, I can't take it any longer! I must\nknow what kind of cream they're using!
74	Uh... Gorg?
75	Uh... Gorg?
76	Excuse me... Gorg?
77	Err... Gorg?
78	What?!
79	Oh, I'm very sorry. Er... Now about our\nstrategy...
80	That not problem here.
81	What Gorg say in mind, Gorg actually\nsay in mouth. We hear everything.
82	Y-you heard all that?!
83	Silly Gorg. If Gorg want dessert so\nbadly, Gorg should just say!
84	No - but - I - ahh...
85	It all fine. Tora want to eat tasty\nyumyums too!
86	That OK, everyone?
87	Sure, sure. What is it you wanted to\norder, Gorg?
88	I'm on board with that. Whatcha\nwanna eat, Gorg?
89	I suppose there's nothing else for it.\nWhat would you like to eat, Gorg?
90	I suppose I'm up for that. What d'you\nwant to order, Gorg?
91	Well... In that case, I'll have three of\nwhat that woman's having!

7	OK, wow, this is something else.

20	Poppi have question for Dagas.
21	You may speak.
22	Why Dagas always such negative?
23	It true, Dagas always look like he not\ncaring. Always acting high and mighty,\nbut never seem motivated!
24	Your expectations seem misguided.
25	Why should one such as myself be\nforced to expend precious energy?
26	In battle, it important to act like life\nis on line.
27	It true! Need to give all in battle or\nmight end up food for monsters!
28	Then that would be my Driver's\nnegligence, would it not?
29	In which case, it is the Driver who\nneeds to be thoroughly motivated.
30	It makes no sense that I should give my\nall while my Driver is lacking.
31	Big shock! Tora never heard argument\nlike that before!
32	My, I really had no idea that a Blade\ncould think that way. I don't have the\nwords...
33	How should I respond?
34	You act like you're some kind of king.
35	Maybe I don't want to be your Driver.
36	How should I respond?
37	You act like you're a king, Dagas.
38	I've had enough of you, Dagas.
39	How shall I respond?
40	You act like you're a king, Dagas.
41	Dagas, this is where we part ways.
42	How should I respond?
43	You really lord it over everyone, huh.
44	I've had enough. Toodles, Dagas.
45	Of course I do.
46	I am the ruler of a nation.
47	Huh?
48	Eh?
49	What?
50	Come again?
51	Dagas ruler of country?\nFirst Tora hear of it!
52	A Blade can't be a king.\nThat's not possible.
53	To be precise, I was King before I\nbecame a Blade.
54	Properly speaking, it is a crime for a\nmere Driver to wield one of my\nstanding.
55	But it'd be more terrible yet if my Driver\nwere to perish in battle, so I endure this\nhumiliation with magnanimity.
56	But hang on... There's no way you can\nstill have your past memories!
57	Whether I have memories or not is\ninsignificant.
58	What matters is that I was,\nwithout doubt, a ruler.
59	No doubt someday you will come\nacross vestiges of my once great reign.
60	Ohhh boy.
61	What?!
62	You wish to expel me?!
63	A mere retainer wishes to abandon\ntheir king?
64	It is I who should be displeased.
65	But to my good fortune, I now\nunderstand something.
66	I had long wondered why you\ndid not show me the respect\nI should rightfully command.
67	To think that you had not recognized\nmy noble lineage, my kingly presence...
68	But now you see, yes?\nIt is beneath me to exert myself\nin service to you.
69	I will apply my full capabilities only\nwhen I myself see fit.
70	Until such time, I trust you will\ntake care of all menial tasks.
71	Are we clear on that? Good.\nNow do not bother me with\ntrifling issues any longer.
72	Uh, right...
73	Uh, right...
74	Have it your way.
75	Oooo...kay then?

1	Hey, look at that! Have you ever seen\nsuch a beautiful sunset?
2	I knew it would be worth coming here!
3	It's one of those things that stays in\nyour mind forever after you've seen it.\nIt's like I can't take my eyes off it.
4	...
5	Oh...what's this?
6	Suddenly the skies don't seem so...
7	Ah. Well. You know, it's funny, but\nthis seems to happen to me a lot.
8	Nice, dry days start to pour with\nrain, just like that.
9	Or sometimes, it's blizzards, or great\nbig hailstones. I think the clouds\nmight like to follow me around.
10	But maybe that's actually a talent!\nIt's like I get to see two different views\nfor the price of one!
11	Hmmm... How should I answer...?
12	You really know how to look on the\nbright side, Kasandra.
13	Maybe you should get that thing on\nyour back seen to? By, uh, an exorcist?
14	Hmmm... How should I answer...?
15	You're such a sunshiney soul, Kasandra.
16	Are you sure that creepy thing on your\nback isn't tainting your luck?
17	Hmmm... How should I answer...?
18	You really know how to sustain your\nown morale, Kasandra.
19	Have you ever considered the notion\nthat thing on your back may be cursed?
20	Hmmm... How should I answer...?
21	Kasandra, you always look on the bright\nside. You're my kind of gal.
22	Have you ever thought that gewgaw on\nyour back might be blighting your luck?
23	Yes, it's true! I can always see the silver\nlining of every cloud!
24	Even when the beautiful sunset we\ncame all this way to see gets blocked\nout by rain...
25	Even when that good luck charm\nI bought at the store snapped\nclean in half the next day...
26	I always keep looking forward!\nIt's just how I am.
27	As long as you always stay strong and\nkeep your chin up, happiness will come\nyour way! That's what I believe!
28	And even if terrible misfortunes\nbefall my Driver, I'm sure if I stay\ncheerful it'll keep their spirits up!
29	That's what a good Blade does, right?!
30	Huh?!
31	You don't think this mask is cute?
32	...But I thought it was really charming...
33	This is the sort of face that brings luck!\nIt couldn't possibly be cursed!
34	You say that, but...\nSometimes when I see you in battle,\neven I get kind of scared...
35	When you put that mask on, you start\nattacking the enemy without mercy!
36	Seriously, I reckon you should get\nthat thing looked at.
37	Whenever you put it on in battle, it's\nlike you're a whole different person.\nA really...violent person.
38	Oh, dear... How do I say this?\nI suppose you wouldn't necessarily\nnotice it yourself, but, well...
39	There's something...not quite normal\nabout the way you fight. When you put\nthat mask on, you go a little berserk.
40	Uhhh, you say that, but that thing gives\noff a seriously evil aura in battle!
41	When you put that mask on and start\nattacking enemies, it's like you're in\nsome kind of blood frenzy.
42	Ahahaha!
43	Don't be silly. I would never\ndo anything like that!
44	...
45	What?
46	I mean, when I'm on the battlefield,\nit's like I'm in a trance sometimes.\nI don't remember much afterwards.
47	I guess I must be really good at\nfocusing on the job!
48	It takes a lot of attention looking out\nfor you guys, you know!
49	I get really into it!
50	...
51	Well, this rain's really gotten worse.\nIt's sad to leave such a beautiful place,\nbut we'd better get moving.
52	I thought we had a pretty great\ntime here today, didn't you?\nI really like it when we all hang out!
53	...
54	Sometimes I think I'm the luckiest\nBlade alive.
55	I've got such a great Driver, and\nall these wonderful companions!
56	Let's try and be the happiest that we\ncan. Then we can spread that\nhappiness over the whole world!

1	Here is place!\nWord on street is, this place\nserve amazing breakfasts!
2	Hmm...
3	What is matter, Boreas?
4	Something bothering you?
5	Something bugging you, or what?
6	Is there something wrong?
7	Something got you hot and bothered?
8	...It's no good!
9	No good?\nWhat is no good?
10	I'm just not in the mood to\neat the food here right now.
11	Something wrong with food here?
12	No, it's not bad or anything!
13	It's just...no good.\nI wanna go someplace else!
14	I wanna go eat in Argentum!
15	If go all the way to Argentum now,\nTora die of starvation!
16	Ah, it won't take that long.\nI'll just pop over and be back\nin the blink of an eye!
17	Boreas is only one can do that!
18	Come on, we eat food here!
19	But I don't want to!
20	Calm down, you two.\nBoreas, can I ask you something?
21	What should I ask Boreas?
22	Do you have some special preferences\nwhen it comes to breakfast?
23	Tell me why you don't like this place.
24	Oh, calm down, you two.\nBoreas, tell me something.
25	What should I ask Boreas?
26	So you're pretty picky about\nyour breakfast, are you?
27	What's your beef with this place?
28	Calm down now, the both of you.\nBoreas, tell me...
29	What shall I ask Boreas?
30	Do you have some particular\nbreakfast preferences?
31	What do you have against this place?
32	Now hang on a minute, you two.\nBoreas, tell me something.
33	What should I ask Boreas?
34	You've got some picky ideas about\nbreakfast, is that it?
35	Why d'you hate this place so much?
36	Hmm? I wouldn't say I'm picky\nabout breakfast specifically...
37	I eat anything that's tasty.\nAnd I won't eat anything that isn't!
38	Sounds pretty picky to Tora...
39	In fact, just like tiny littlepon\nthrowing tantrum!
40	Heck no! I'm not being childish!
41	Tasty things are food, and nasty\nthings aren't food! That's all!
42	Or what, you expect me to eat\nthings that aren't food?!
43	Hang on, you think anything that's\ntasty qualifies as food?
44	Hold up, hold up. Anything that's\ntasty is food? Anything at all?
45	Then...you would eat anything at all\nas long as the taste pleases you?
46	Hang on, you don't mean you'd eat\nANYTHING as long as it tastes good?
47	Of course! I'd even eat a\nNopon if it tasted good!
48	Meh-meh-meh?!
49	T-Tora is not tasty! Cute and adorable,\nbut not at all delicious!
50	Hey, don't worry!
51	I wouldn't eat a friend, no matter\nhow tasty they looked!
52	I'll make do with just sneaking a few\nlicks at night when you're asleep.
53	Meh-meh-meh-meh?!
54	Oh, I get it.\nSo that's why Tora's feet look all\nwet in the morning sometimes!
55	Huh, that figures.\nI did think Tora's feet looked weirdly\nwet in the morning sometimes.
56	Ah, I see.\nThat would explain why Tora's feet\nsometimes look wet in the morning.
57	Heh, it all makes sense now.\nNo wonder Tora's feet always look\nwet in the morning!
58	Meh-meh-meh-meh-meh-meh-meh!
59	I wouldn't say I hate the place.\nThey serve some pretty nice food here!
60	Then what problem?
61	Menu has big variety, so should\nnot be problem with choice...
62	Listen, there's just nothing I want\nto eat here any more!
63	Even littlest littlepon is not that picky!
64	I'm not being picky!
65	The truth is, I already checked out all\nthe food here before you all woke up!
66	Boreas did what?
67	Meh-meh-meh...\nThen food you were eating\nback at inn was...
68	You got it!\nThat was all from here!
69	I've already had my fill of\neverything on the menu!
70	Ahahaha! I should have known.\nWhen it comes to food, you act\nquicker than anyone!
71	Bahahaha! That's our Boreas for you.\nPut a Tasty Sausage at the finish line,\nand he'd beat the world's best sprinter!
72	Hahaha... Well, that explains everything.\nI should have known we could never\nbeat Boreas to a meal.
73	Bahahah! Boreas, buddy, when\nit comes to food, you're the\nspeediest guy in Alrest.
74	Boreas too fast for Tora.\nTora cannot keep up...

1	What's up, Floren?\nYou look down in the dumps.
2	You all right, Floren?\nWhat's up?
3	Are you OK?\nYou don't look it.
4	Hey, Floren, what's the matter?\nCheer up!
5	The land is choked with sand...
6	Is this really Elysium?
7	No flowers, no trees, no grass.\nJust a barren plain of rocks and sand.
8	Look.\nI bet that was a beautiful lake once.
9	But there isn't even a drop of water\nleft.
10	I guess this place doesn't get much\nrain.
11	I suppose they don't get much rain\nhere.
12	I suppose little rain falls here.
13	Can't imagine they get much rain here!
14	Water is essential for life.
15	But there isn't any here.
16	This place is completely barren.
17	Some places have a drought now and\nagain, but they still have a little hope.\nThis place...
18	It's just...dead.
19	Floren...
20	Isn't there something we can do to\nbring the greenery back?
21	It's so sad to think that the land might \nhave died forever.
22	Hey, Floren...
23	There must be some way to bring back\nthe greenery.
24	It's pretty sad to think the land might\nhave died forever.
25	Floren...
26	Shall we search for a way to bring back\nthe greenery?
27	It is a terrible thing to think that this\nplace might be sterile forever.
28	Hey, Floren.
29	I wonder if there's some way to bring\nback the old greenery.
30	It's jolly sad to see the land so\ndesolate.
31	No roots can take hold in sand\nlike this. And nothing is going to\ngrow without water.
32	Wait!
33	Maybe something CAN grow!
34	?
35	Well, you know life is a powerful thing.
36	It may be too dry for seeds here, but...
37	...We could get some seedlings from\nsomewhere else and plant them here?
38	...We could get some seedlings from\nsomewhere else and plant them here?
39	...We could get some seedlings from\nsomewhere else and plant them here?
40	...We could get some seedlings from\nsomewhere else and plant them here?
41	Yes!
42	At first, they probably won't last very\nlong.
43	But as plants die, their remains\nfertilize the soil.
44	They'll be giving their goodness back to\nthe next generations.
45	It'll take a while. But do it enough\ntimes...
46	and eventually this dead\nland can be restored to life!
47	Hey, there's the old Floren!
48	That's more like the Floren I know.
49	At last. You seem to be back\nto your old self.
50	Heyyy, there we go!\nBack to your old self!
51	Yes! Thank you.
52	I'm going to do it.
53	I'm going to bring back the vegetation!
54	That's so sad...
55	When nature is destroyed, life and\neverything else is destroyed with it.
56	Don't people feel any shame when they\nsee places like this?
57	All life comes from nature. All beings\nshould live in harmony with it.
58	Why don't people treat it with the\nrespect it deserves?
59	Why do they let it fall into this state?\nAll life is precious, something to be\ncherished!
60	That's so true. Nobody realizes how\nimportant the environment is.
61	You're right. Nobody gets how\nimportant this stuff is.
62	That's true. Few realize the\nimportance of the environment.
63	Yup, you hit the nail on the head.\nNobody gets it.
64	I'm a Blade, so I wasn't born from\nnature.
65	Mortals are part of nature, and I envy\nthem for that. But it angers me to see\nthem show no regard for it.
66	There are good humans out there, of\ncourse. Like you.
67	But mostly... I just don't\nunderstand them.
68	That's OK, though.
69	Well, it's early days. Maybe someday,\nhumans and Blades will come to\nunderstand each other.
70	Yeah, I think you're right.
71	Maybe one day, Blades will understand\nhumans, and humans will understand\nBlades.
72	Ah, it's still early days.
73	Maybe we all just need a little more\ntime to understand each other.
74	Don't worry about it!
75	Maybe in time, mutual understanding\nand harmony will blossom... Wow,\nthat's deep. I better write it down.
76	Yeah, you're right.
77	I actually feel like you understand me\npretty well already.
78	That's why I feel like I can keep going\neven in the face of sadness.
79	Thank you for everything!

1	Hey, come on, Theory!\nThis way!
2	Don't rush me, sis.\nThe scenery isn't going anywhere.
3	Don't be silly! What if we miss\nsome kind of amazing moment?!
4	C'mon, get moving!
5	Hmph...
6	Praxis looks pretty excited, huh?
7	Praxis's getting totally excited, huh?
8	Praxis seems quite excited.
9	Praxis looks dead excited, huh?
10	Yeah... Well, I mean... She's getting\na bit carried away, if you ask me.
11	Honestly...\nI wish she'd calm down a bit.
12	You say that, but I get the feeling\nyou're enjoying yourself too.
13	You say that, but I bet you're enjoying\nyourself just as much really!
14	So you say, but it seems to me that\nyou're enjoying yourself quite a bit too.
15	You say that, but you're having\na good time too. Am I wrong?
16	Do you think so?
17	I suppose you might be right.
18	I've got to spend plenty of time with\nPraxis lately. That's always good.
19	I really like being with her.
20	What should I say?
21	It's almost like you're real sisters.
22	I guess you really get each other now.
23	What should I say?
24	You're just like human sisters, huh?
25	You really get each other now, huh?
26	What shall I say?
27	It's as if you're real sisters.
28	You've come to understand each other.
29	What should I say?
30	You're like real sisters, aren't you?
31	I guess you really get each other now.
32	You think so...? It's hard for\nme to tell, personally.
33	It's just, well, you know how she's\nconstantly acting before she thinks.
34	I'm always so nervous for her, I can't\nleave her alone for a moment.
35	Yet somehow, I don't feel like\nthat's a bad thing. It's always\nkind of fun to be around her.
36	I guess you're always thinking\nabout each other, huh? I'm sure\nPraxis feels the same way.
37	Sounds like you've always got each\nother on the mind. I bet Praxis\nthinks about you a lot, too.
38	I suppose you must always be thinking\nabout each other. Her as well as you.
39	I reckon you've always got each\nother on the mind. I'd say she\nthinks about you a lot, too.
40	I guess you're right... Maybe that's\nwhat being sisters is about.
41	But, Praxis is the older one, yet it's me\nwho seems to be worrying about her...
42	Haha! That's true... But she wouldn't\nbe Praxis otherwise, right?
43	Haha! Yeah... But I guess that's\nwhat makes her Praxis!
44	Ha ha... True enough. But I suppose\nthat's all part of Praxis's charm.
45	Haha! Yeah... But she wouldn't be\nPraxis otherwise, would she?
46	You think so?
47	Sometimes I'm not sure. I still don't feel\nlike I know everything about her.
48	And I'm sure she doesn't always get\neverything about me.
49	But, she said something once...
50	She told me, we may not have any\nmemories, but it's no use worrying\nabout what we don't have.
51	If we know nothing about each other's\npasts... That just means we have a\nclean slate for the future.
52	Every moment we spend together now\nis a new memory for us to share.
53	Wow... That's deep, but I can see\nhow it's the kind of thing she'd say.
54	Huh... Pretty deep stuff! But that\nattitude is Praxis all over.
55	I see... Perhaps that attitude is why\nPraxis is such a lovely person.
56	Hah! Deep stuff, coming from her.\nBut somehow, that's Praxis all over.
57	Exactly. And that's why...
58	That's why the time that I spend with\nher is so special to me.
59	And at the same time, my Driver is\nimportant to me, too!
60	I couldn't be more grateful to you\nfor bringing us back together.
61	Hey, Theory! What're you up to?
62	Quit getting all cozy with your Driver\nand get over here already!
63	Cozy? What's that supposed to mean?!
64	C'mon, over here, look!\nQuickly!
65	Hey, you too! Let's check it out!
66	This is gonna be a memory\nfor all three of us to treasure!

1	There's supposed to be a totally\namazing view through here!
2	I'm so pumped for this!
3	That interests you? I cannot say the\nsame.
4	Aw, come on, lighten up! We can go\ntogether. It'll be fun!
5	You could bring an army and it would\nstill not interest me.
6	I'm going on ahead.
7	Hey, hold up Theory! Don't go out\non your own!
8	Theory, why are you being so cold\nto me?
9	It's nothing personal. I'm equally cold\nto everyone.
10	Even to my Driver, it is the same.
11	Yeah, I guess that's true.
12	That's right. Theory's a cool kind\nof gal.
13	I can't deny that. Though I don't think\nit's a bad thing per se.
14	True, that. But that's just her\ncharacter.
15	Uhh... That's not what I mean. What\nI'm trying to say is...
16	I promised you. The old you.
17	I promised that I wouldn't forget you.
18	The old you wanted the two of us to\nstay friends.
19	Which is why...
20	I don't see why you would go to such\nlengths.
21	The present me doesn't think the same\nway.
22	And both you and I have lost our\nmemories once before.
23	Ah...
24	How should I respond?
25	Try to consider Praxis's feelings.
26	You know, you two are really alike.
27	How should I respond?
28	Try to consider Praxis's feelings.
29	Y'know, you two are really alike.
30	How should I respond?
31	Try to consider Praxis's feelings.
32	You two are really quite alike.
33	How should I respond?
34	Maybe consider Praxis's feelings?
35	You two are pretty similar really.
36	Sorry.
37	I'm not trying to be cold to her.
38	It's OK. I understand.
39	I'm just another Blade to you. Nothing\nmore, nothing less. I get it.
40	Hmm...
41	But it's different for me.
42	I knew the old you. I wanted to be\ntogether with you, always.
43	We are alike?
44	The old Praxis was never really\nbothered about her memories.
45	And that seemed to make the\nprevious Theory really sad.
46	The old Praxis was never really\nbothered about her memories.
47	And it looked like that made the\nprevious Theory really sad.
48	The old Praxis didn't care very\nmuch about her memories.
49	And I got the impression that fact\nmade the previous Theory quite sad.
50	The old Praxis hardly cared about\nher memories.
51	And that seemed to upset the\nold Theory one heck of a lot.
52	And that's why you're sad? Because\nyou knew the former me?
53	I'm not that sad about it. Yet. But if this\nkeeps up, I might just start crying.
54	Haha...
55	...
56	You two are like sisters!
57	Though I guess it's weird for Blades\nto have sisters...
58	You two are basically sisters.
59	Though I guess it's kinda funny for\nBlades to have sisters, huh...
60	You two are essentially sisters.
61	Though perhaps sisters is the wrong\nword, considering you're both Blades...
62	You're basically sisters, right?
63	Though it isn't half strange for Blades\nto have sisters...
64	Sisters...
65	I like that!
66	You're happy with this?
67	Heck yeah! It makes us sound special!
68	I can be the older sis, and you can\nbe the younger one!
69	Hmm...
70	Theory, would you mind calling me\n"big sis"?
71	I would mind.
72	I guess you've gotta warm to it, huh?
73	Well, li'l sis, you can call me big\nsis any time you want!
74	I will never call you that.
75	Hey, it's early days.
76	Still, thank you!
77	I was worried for a while, but I think\nI'll be able to keep our promise now!

1	Ahh... What a spectacular view.
2	I can't help but wonder how such\na structure was even built.
3	Ngh...
4	This place is pretty tough\non Blades, isn't it?
5	I feel you, girl. This place is\npretty tough on Blades...
6	This place is difficult for you\nBlades, is it not?
7	This place is tough on you Blades, huh?\nIt gets to me too, y'know.
8	No, not at all!\nThis is nothing I can't bear.
9	Seriously though, Perun, are you OK?
10	C'mon, Perun. Don't push yourself.
11	You seem to be struggling quite\na bit from what I can see...
12	Yeah, but that's just stubbornness\ntalking, right? You can't fool me.
13	I said...I'm fine!
14	Why did you want to come to\na place like this, anyway?
15	Seriously though, why'd you even want\nto come to a place like this?
16	At any rate, why did you want\nto come to a place like this?
17	Why'd you want to come here in\nthe first place, anyway?
18	Well... Why do you think?
19	What should I say?
20	You wanted to meet the hero Addam?
21	You just...like being in pain?
22	What should I say?
23	You want to meet the hero, Addam?
24	You just...enjoy pain or something?
25	What shall I say?
26	You wish to meet the hero Addam?
27	You enjoy being in pain?
28	What should I say?
29	You wanted to meet Addam, right?
30	You just like being in pain, don't'cha?
31	That's right.
32	Well, to be more precise, I wanted to\nlearn more about him.
33	What...?!
34	Don't misunderstand!\nSome may feel that way, but\nI am definitely not one of them.
35	I won't deny that being here causes\nme untold physical suffering...
36	And yes, I may accept this\nwillingly as a trial to endure...
37	But that does not mean I derive\nany...enjoyment from it!
38	Urnghh!
39	Oh, gotcha.\nBut then why WOULD you come here?
40	O-okay, good. Just checking.\nWhy DID you want to come here, then?
41	I did think it seemed like a long shot.\nWhy did you want to come here, then?
42	Not a deviant, eh? Could've fooled me.\nWhat DID you come here for, then?
43	Well...
44	I was hoping to learn more\nabout the hero Addam.
45	Pyra and Mythra and Brighid...\nNot to mention Jin and Malos...\nThey all have links to Addam.
46	So I thought by learning about the past,\nI could understand the present.
47	Perhaps the deeper reason behind\nthe conflict we find ourselves in\nlies in the depths of history.
48	If I could learn of that reason, it would\nhelp me discern my true foe and strike\nthem down without hesitation.
49	You're too serious, Perun.\nThere's no need to take it that far.
50	Perun, you're too serious.\nYou need to relax about things...
51	It is possible to be too serious about\nthings, you know. Food for thought.\nWhat you are doing is not normal.
52	You ever think you might be too serious\nabout stuff, huh, Perun? And I mean,\nlike, ALL stuff...
53	Oh, I only do what I feel I must!
54	To be my Driver's sword and shield\nis the calling of any Blade!
55	So I want to have as much clarity\nin my purpose as possible.
56	Now, shall we explore these\ncaverns a little more?
57	Nghh...
58	Please, don't worry about me.\nLet's keep moving!
59	I can't help but admire\nPerun's determination...
60	But even so, we should probably\ncall it a day for now.
61	It's great that Perun's\nso determined and all...
62	But I'd better get her out of this\nplace before she actually collapses.
63	I feel a new appreciation for\nPerun's strength of will...
64	But I think I had better stop her\nbefore she pushes herself too hard.
65	Perun's determined attitude\nis pretty cool and all...
66	But I think I'd better get her out of\nhere before she passes out.

1	*gasp* So, this is the mighty\nSaffronia tree?
2	There aren't many trees with red\nblossoms... Woowee! That's a real\nhumdinger. Yup, it's pretty.
3	Oh, hey, by the way...
4	You hear lots of legends about big trees\nlike this, right? Like, if you confess your\nlove underneath them, it'll come true?
5	Yeah. I've heard that kind of\ngumph before too.
6	Right? But if you ask me, it's probably\na load of old nonsense.
7	I mean, if it was that easy to find\ntrue love, the whole world would\nbe full of nothing but happy folks.
8	You seem very convinced, but have\nyou ever tested your hypothesis?
9	What, me, making confessions of love?\nI mean, if we're gonna talk about that,\nhow about you, Brighid?
10	You seem the sincere, passionate type.\nHave you ever made a confession\nof love to anyone?
11	Me? Of course not.
12	How about you, Pyra?
13	Huh?\nMe?
14	Oh, but of course, silly me.\nYou've already got your special\nsomeone, haven't you?
15	Huh? What do you mean,\nI've already...?!
16	And the same goes for you\nPandoria, of course.
17	Well...I'm not gonna say you're wrong.
18	As for you, Poppi...I guess you're\nstill a bit young to be thinking about\nthat kind of thing.
19	Poppi not born yesterday. But not\nmuch more long ago than yesterday.\nSo not really understand.
20	Yeah, you probably just need to get\na little bit bigger before this kind of\nthing makes sense to you.
21	So, how about you, Driver?
22	Ah... What should I say?
23	Just let me take in this scenery, will\nyou?
24	I'll confess my love right now!
25	Ah... What should I say?
26	Hey, just let me look at this view, will\nyou?
27	You want a confession of love?\nI'll give you one right now!
28	Ah... What should I say?
29	Quiet. Let me enjoy the view.
30	Allow me to confess my love right now!
31	Ah... What should I say?
32	Hey, I need to get some inspiration\nfrom this view here.
33	Heck, why not. I'll confess my\nlove right here and now!
34	Uh? What?
35	How long do you need to look at it?\nOne look lasts a lifetime, you know.
36	Kora... Don't you think a little peace\nand quiet is important to really absorb\nthe beauty of nature?
37	Nah, not so much. I feel like I've got it\nall packed away in the brain-box\nalready.
38	But anyhow. Is anyone else getting\npeckish for something sweet?
39	Hey, Pyra! Why don't we slink away\nsomewhere and get a Blossom Custard\nor something?
40	I hear that's one of the must-try things\nhere in Uraya.
41	Well, you know me. I'm happy\nas long as everyone else is.
42	I'm not too sure what it is about this\nsituation that's making you hungry\nexactly.
43	I think Kora just prefers the practical\nto the aesthetic.
44	The what to the what? Those were\nsome fancy words there, Brighid.
45	When I see something pretty, I get\nhungry, that's all. Doesn't everyone?
46	Maybe it's just a phase I'm going\nthrough. Something to do with my\nbiorhythms.
47	Kora, I think you might be\noverthinking this somewhat.
48	But, I mean, it makes a lot of sense. A\nyoung girl's desire is a force of nature.\nIt knows no limits!
49	It's all that boundless energy that gives\nus our appeal. You should remember\nthat, Poppi.
50	Looks like being a girl is quite complex.\nPoppi will study hard to be girl\neffectively.
51	Huh?\nR-right now?!
52	W-wow, this is a little embarrassing...\nEr, I don't know what to say...
53	Now-now I'm getting all nervous!
54	Kora getting ahead of herself.\nConfession of love not necessarily\nfor Kora.
55	True enough. It could be for me.
56	Or for me!
57	Don't count me outta the running!
58	Seems like there's a healthy\nrivalry brewing here!
59	Come on, Driver! It's time you told us\nexactly who it is you've got a special\nsoft spot for!
60	U-um, guys?\nI was just joking...
61	Oh, for the... I was kidding, obviously!\nCan't you take a joke?!
62	Actually, I was only trying to lighten\nthe mood. Was my humor too subtle?
63	Oh, come off it, ladies.\nIsn't it obvious I was joking around?
64	Just a joke? Aw, and there I was\ngetting all excited...
65	I honestly thought it was serious...
66	Oh Pyra... You're so sweet and gullible.\nI was just playing along, of course.
67	Poppi's sensors detected distinct\nrise in heart rate of Brighid.
68	Ah...um...
69	Hey, maybe this isn't the best place to\ntalk about all this stuff. Let's get into it\nback in the girl's room at the inn.
70	This one'll be strictly for us girl Blades.\nNo Drivers. It's Bladies' Night!
71	We'll get a few sweet treats and just\nnatter till the sun comes up. Ooh, I\ncan't wait!
72	Poppi can join in while charging\nbattery. Good opportunity for Poppi's\npsychological development!
73	Some of it could be a little\nadvanced for you, Poppi.\nEven I might struggle to keep up!
74	Indeed...
75	I think I'll let Mythra handle this one...
76	Ooh! I'm so excited, I could just burst!\nLike, literally!
77	But, hey, don't worry. It's not like we're\ndoing this just so we can trash-talk\nDrivers.

1	What's up, Azami? Didn't you want\nto see the view from here?
2	What's up, Azami? Didn't you want\nto see the view from here?
3	What's the matter, Azami? Didn't you\nwant to see the view from here?
4	What's up, Azami? Didn't you want\nto see the view from here?
5	Never mind. I'm done.
6	Done? You mean you've seen enough?
7	Done? You mean you've seen enough?
8	Done? You mean you've seen enough?
9	Done? You mean you've seen enough?
10	It's no fun now. Your little fan club's\nruined the mood already.
11	Can't we make this a private date\nand ditch the others?
12	Wha-? A date?
13	Wha-? A date?!
14	A date? With me?
15	A date? Well, this is sudden!
16	Tee hee. What's wrong with that?
17	I want to get to know you.\nIntimately.
18	Just the two of us, dining on fine food,\ngazing out at the sky above and\ntalking for hours...
19	Hold on! Why just the two of you?
20	Haha! Something wrong?
21	We're Driver and Blade. It's only\nnatural that we'd be alone together.
22	It's not natural. We're all part of the\nteam too. We should all stick together.
23	Thanks but no thanks, doll. I want\nto talk to my Driver in private.
24	What I like to eat? If I had to pick,\nprobably Pan-Fried Tartari?
25	What I like to eat? Uhh, Cream Orange\nParatha, I guess?
26	What I like to eat? I'm quite partial\nto Quoteletta.
27	What I like to eat? If I had to pick,\nit'd be Sweet Armu Belly Stew.
28	*sigh*
29	Hey, Drivercheeks. What do you think\nabout all this?
30	How should I respond?
31	I want us all to be together.
32	I can spend some time with Azami.
33	How should I respond?
34	I want us all to have a good time.
35	I could spend some time with Azami.
36	How should I respond?
37	I'd prefer everyone to be together.
38	I don't mind spending time with Azami.
39	How should I respond?
40	Hey, the more the merrier!
41	I could spend some time with Azami.
42	Oh... So that's how it is.
43	Too bad for you, Azami.
44	Oh don't worry. I'm only just getting\nwarmed up.
45	So, my cutie pie, tell me...what do you\nlike to eat?
46	Can't get enough of that delicious-yet-\nreasonably-priced grease bomb...
47	Haha... Oh, just you wait and see.
48	What are you planning?
49	Why, I'm going to make breakfast\nevery morning.
50	Right now, my precious Driver may\nprefer to hang out with friends...
51	But soon, it'll be all too clear that\nI'm more devoted than any of you.
52	Believe me, once you get a taste of\nthe real Azami, she's all you can think\nabout, day and night!
53	I get it. You're a temptress through\nand through, huh.
54	Hahaha! I've been called worse.
55	Just don't try and pull anything funny.\nI'll be the first to know about it.
56	Oh, we'll see... Look forward to it,\nmy Driver cutie...
57	Just...be careful. You never know what\nher type might do...
58	You would?!
59	Then let's head out. Right this second!
60	First I want to try that famous noodle\nsoup from Argentum...
61	And then, after watching the sun set\nbeneath the Cloud Sea, we'll charter\nthe Maelstrom and sail to Gormott!
62	On the journey, we will dine\nunder the stars to the dulcet\ntones of Nopon music.
63	Then, after our three-day cruise, we'll\nstay over in a luxury suite in Torigoth.
64	Wait a second! What is this,\nsome kind of honeymoon?!
65	We don't have time for your wild\nfantasies. See, even your Driver\nis looking bemused.
66	I don't hear any objections.
67	Trust me, you'll make your own Driver\nhate you if you carry on like this.
68	What...?!
69	I can see how much you treasure your\nDriver, really I do. But it can't all be\none-sided.
70	...I suppose you're right.
71	As long as you get it.
72	I'm not going to stop you going out\ntogether, but...have some restraint, OK?
73	All right...
74	I suppose I could bring myself\nto forget the luxury suite and\njust make do with the cruise.
75	She doesn't get it at all!

1	Ursula, we've arrived!
2	This is the view you\nwanted to see, right?
3	Aaaand we're here!
4	This is the place you meant,\nright, Ursula?
5	I believe this is the place you\nwere talking about, Ursula.
6	You wanted to see the view\nhere, if I recall?
7	This is the place you wanted to come\nto, right, Ursula?
8	I suppose you wanted to eyeball the\nview or something.
9	That's right.
10	...
11	...
12	Scenery indeed very nice. But did\nUrsula want to see something\nparticular?
13	Um, yes. That.
14	Red tree thing?
15	Y-yes... It's a Saffronia tree.
16	There's an old nursery rhyme\nabout this tree...
17	I always loved it.
18	Oh? Like, a lullaby?
19	You're pretty sensitive to\nmusic, aren't you, Ursula.
20	Oh yeah?
21	I guess songs are your kind of thing.
22	A children's song?
23	You're very attuned to music, Ursula.
24	A kid's song, eh?
25	Anything musical's right up your street,\nhuh?
26	I guess.
27	It's...something I'm drawn to.
28	That little bit strange.\nTora never hear Ursula sing.
29	Ursula only like listen to music?
30	Well, I like to sing, certainly.
31	But I get...nervous around people...
32	Ursula really very shy person, huh?\nFeels eyes of spectators on her.
33	S-sorry...
34	What should I say...
35	Do I make you nervous too?
36	Can you play an instrument, too?
37	What should I say...
38	I don't make you nervous though, right?
39	D'you play any instruments?
40	What should I say...
41	Do even I make you feel abashed?
42	Do you play an instrument as well?
43	What should I say...
44	I don't make you nervous though, right?
45	Hey, can you play an instrument?
46	Huh?
47	That very daring question.\nEven Tora was little bit surprised!
48	Whew, so it's not just me...
49	Tora want to know too, though.\nHow Ursula really feel?
50	Erm...
51	...
52	I...ah...
53	...
54	I don't dislike you or anything...but...
55	I do find it a bit hard to feel\ncomfortable around you. I'm sorry!
56	Ursula not need worry so much!
57	When Tora first meet Rex-Rex and\nfriends, Tora lose tongue and run out of\nwords. Took long time to make friends!
58	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]That's...not how I remember it...
59	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Uh-huh. Sure you did.
60	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]How very unlike Tora...
61	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Is Tora pulling our legs?
62	[ML:Feeling ]So it took you a while?
63	Maybe...I can get used to everyone in\ntime, too.
64	I...I'd really like to get comfortable\nwith everyone, so we can really\nenjoy our time together...
65	As long as you feel that way,\nI'm sure it'll work out!
66	Don't worry, these things take time.
67	Hey, I'm sure it'll be fine,\nif you want it that much.
68	I guess it's just something you can't\nrush.
69	Ursula, you're very sincere, so I'm sure\nyou'll achieve your goal.
70	No need to rush. Just take your time.
71	Hey, chill out. It takes time to adjust to\nthe ways of the Zekenator.
72	Just go with the flow. Let it happen.\nSome things can't be rushed.
73	OK!
74	Tora bet Ursula can play every\ninstrument!
75	Um, I'm not very good, but...\nI can play a few.
76	More than one?! Wow!\nWhich is best instrument?
77	Maybe the organ?\nI also quite like the lute...
78	Actually, Tora can play Whispercorder!
79	Nopon children forced to play from\nage of about five years.
80	Oh! I'd love to hear you play sometime.
81	Tora and Ursula should make duet!
82	I'd like that.
83	Actually, Poppi also play.\nCan blow mean trumpet!
84	Fan-based lungs capable\nof incredible sustain!
85	That's amazing!
86	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]It feels like she's forgotten\nall about me...
87	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]But that's OK, as long as she\nseems to be having a good time.
88	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]I hope someday she can be this\nfriendly with everyone!
89	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Is it just me, or has she\nforgotten I'm even here?
90	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]But she seems to be\nhaving a great time.
91	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Maybe one day she'll be able\nto have fun talking about music\nwith the whole gang!
92	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]She seems to have tuned\nout my presence...
93	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]But she seems to be relaxing and\nenjoying herself. That's a good thing.
94	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Perhaps one day, she will be able to\nshare her musical interests with us all.
95	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]You've gotta be kidding me...\nHas she forgotten I'm even here?
96	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]But ah, it's fine. She seems to be\nletting herself go and having a blast.
97	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Maybe one day, she'll be able to\njust hang loose like this with us all.

1	Hahaha, excellent!\nWhat a spectacle!
2	Hey, look here!
3	This one's a military transport vessel...\nand that is what we'd call a destroyer!
4	You look like you're enjoying yourself,\nNewt.
5	You look like you're havin' fun, Newt.
6	You seem to be enjoying yourself,\nNewt.
7	Having fun, eh, Newt?
8	Well, duh!
9	The latest and greatest warships of\nthe Ardainian navy, all in one place!
10	Who wouldn't get excited?
11	Aaah! Look over there!
12	That one being refitted is the newest\nmodel of amphibious assault ship!
13	It's the flagship of Division One of the\nSecond Imperial Guard, you know!
14	What should I reply?
15	Wow, Newt, you really like\nyour battleships, don't you?
16	Wow, Newt, you really like\nthe Ardainian army, don't you?
17	What should I reply?
18	Newt, you sure do like battleships, huh?
19	Newt, you sure do like Ardainian\nmilitary stuff, huh?
20	What should I reply?
21	My word, Newt, you really do like\nbattleships, don't you?
22	My word, Newt, you really do like\nthe Ardainian military, don't you?
23	What should I reply?
24	Newt, you seriously like\nbattleships, eh?
25	Newt, you seriously are an\nArdainian army buff, eh?
26	No, you're totally off-base!
27	Huh?\n...I am?
28	Eh?\n...Off-base?
29	How do you mean?
30	Off-base? Me?
31	Well, the terms are often incorrectly\nconflated...
32	A "battleship" is actually the name of\njust one class of military vessel.
33	When speaking more generally,\nthe correct term is "warship" or\n"combat vessel".
34	There are many subcategories, like\ndestroyers, escort vessels, cruisers\nor battleships...
35	And of course we can't forget transport\nvessels and other specialized craft...
36	Then you can divide them by specific\nduty, or by the size of the Titan they\nincorporate, or by their capabilities...
37	OK, I get it!
38	I don't think I'll remember any of that\nif you rattle it off so quickly...
39	OK, OK, OK!
40	Nobody'll get anything from a lecture\nlike that...
41	Enough!
42	Ah, sorry. Didn't mean to shout. That\nwasn't very professional of me.
43	Enough, already...
44	I've got it now, so please just\nwind down a bit?
45	Oh, really? I was only just getting to\nthe really cool part, but OK...
46	Well, I guess I'll tell you the rest later\nat some point!
47	Whoa!
48	That ship's been specifically made for\nthe Imperial Guard! I cannot believe it's\nhere!
49	C'mon, Driver-person! Let's dash!
50	......
51	Well, obviously!
52	The Ardainian Armed Forces are the\nfinest army in the world!
53	Unlike other countries, in Mor Ardain\nthe state controls the army directly...
54	putting a lot of effort into R&D based\naround applying ancient technology...
55	to create the world's most modern and\ntechnologically advanced military force!
56	And by the way, the Urayan military\nuses mercenary forces mostly, so...
57	each town's training and equipment can\ndiffer, making the units hard to balance!
58	Mor Ardain have a ton of elite officers\nto lead their forces, too - not least the\nmighty Flamebringer, of course.
59	OK, OK, I get the picture!
60	I don't think I'd ever be able to\nremember all that...
61	Fine, I get it! You can stop now.
62	I appreciate the effort, but that's all\nin one ear, right out the other...
63	I'm sorry, that's enough.\nI think I got the gist, though.
64	Enough, enough already!
65	You're talking my ear off\nwith all this nonsense...
66	Aw, come on, there's tons more\nI've got to talk about!
67	I know! How about I tell you stories\nabout all the commanding officers?

2	Hey, Tora, what do you do here?
3	Here is for talk to Titan Archelon!
4	You can talk to Titans?\nTora, that's amazing!
5	Not just Tora.\nNim can do too.
6	What?!\nNo way I can talk to a Titan!
7	I once tried to talk to the Maelstrom's\nTitan and it just tried to eat me!
8	That because Maelstrom Titan only\nspeak Nopon.
9	What, really?
10	Archelon hear Ardainian every day.
11	So you mean that if we talk to him\nnormally, he'll understand?
12	Exactly.
13	Come to think about it, maybe Nim\nhaving problems because Nim\nspeaking wrong language.
14	Ohh, hmm...
15	What should I say to Nim?
16	Give it a go, Nim! You\nknow you want to.
17	What's in your heart is more important\nthan the language you speak.
18	What should I say to Nim?
19	Give it a go.\nYou never know until you try.
20	Words don't mean anything. It's\nfeelings that really count.
21	What should I say to Nim?
22	You should give it a go. You never\nknow unless you try.
23	I believe that feelings speak louder\nthan words.
24	What should I say to Nim?
25	Go on, give it a go! It's a challenge!
26	What really matters is how you feel,\nnot what language you speak.
27	You're right.\nI shouldn't shy away from a challenge!
28	Here we go!
29	Uhh... Mr. Archelon? My name is Nim.\nVery nice to meet you, sir.
30	...
31	You must be angry at the Ardainians\nfor remodeling you like this.
32	Nobody likes to be forced into stuff...
33	I bet you just want to be left\nalone in peace, right?
34	Doesn't look like he can\nunderstand you.
35	Guess he can't understand you.
36	I don't think he's getting it.
37	Was something supposed to happen?
38	Aw...
39	Well, whether he can hear me or not,\nhow is he supposed to respond?
40	?
41	The Ardainians used this technology to\nrip away his ability to speak!
42	Curse the Empire!
43	No, no, I don't think it's that, Nim.
44	I'm pretty sure that's not it.
45	Please believe me when I say that\nthe Empire would never do that.
46	His tongue is still attached, isn't it?\nEven the Empire would never do that.
47	Maybe I was mistaken.
48	I thought I was right, but I was just\nwrong again.
49	Tora is sorry.
50	Tora think all night to come up\nwith this method, but it was no good.
51	Better luck next time, Nim!
52	One day you'll be able to talk to\nanimals and Titans, Nim.
53	If you keep trying, someday\nyou'll succeed.
54	Keep at it! As long as your heart stays\nstrong, there's nothing you can't do!
55	Thanks for the kind words!
56	I might not have been able to talk to\nArchelon, but I feel like I got closer\nto all of you.
57	I'm gonna keep challenging myself,\nand try to live up to your expectations!
58	And someday I'll make friends with\nImmovable Gonzalez and we'll\ngo on a picnic together!
59	Just watch me!
60	Haha, one step at a time!
61	A picnic, eh?\nI wonder what you'd eat...
62	Honestly, that seems dangerous and\nunlikely.
63	How is he going to go on a picnic\nif he can't move?
64	Oh! A good point...
65	It's all about having mutual empathy!\nNot about the meaning of words.
66	Why not ask Pandoria?
67	Pandoria? Why?
68	Pandoria can summon Tantalese\nTitan, so definitely have mutual\nempathy!
69	That's right - she made Genbu rise out\nof the Cloud Sea!
70	Good idea!\nRemember what she did when we went\nto Tantal? Could you do that?
71	Hmm...I had forgotten about that.\nTalking to her would be a good idea.
72	Great idea!\nPandoria can definitely help you out!
73	Pandoria, help me please!
74	Yeah, but I don't think my powers\nwill work on anyone but Genbu...
75	I have to try!\nWould you teach me?
76	Sure, whatever.
77	First, place your hand on your chest.
78	Allow thoughts of the Titan to swell\nin your mind. Then call out to it.\nGently!
79	One two... One two, testing...\nCan you hear me?
80	...
81	Is anybody there?\nI'd like to talk to you.
82	...
83	Nothing, huh?
84	No reply. Ugh.
85	You couldn't hear anything?
86	Yes, that's what I said. I couldn't\nhear anything.
87	Maybe it's because I don't have\nthe right kind of ears...
88	Ears?
89	Yeah. Your ears are all...pointy.\nMine aren't.
90	Not sure that has anything to do with it,\nbut Kit and Sunny have pointy ears.
91	Oh! That's right!
92	Even though they can hear the Titan,\nthey won't share it with me! Ugh! Rude!
93	I feel so betrayed!
94	I didn't mean to cause any trouble...\nIt was really just a joke.
95	*sigh*\nLooks like there's some way to go\nbefore Nim can talk to animals.
96	*sigh*\nLooks like there's some way to go\nbefore Nim can talk to animals.
97	*sigh*\nLooks like there's some way to go\nbefore Nim can talk to animals.

45	Well, I guess...compared to your\naverage Blade.

1	...There's no reason I should recognize\nthis place...
2	So what is this I feel...?
3	This tugging in my breast...\nI can't shake this sense of...
4	Vess?!
5	You're Vess, aren't you?
6	Hm?
7	So you've come back!
8	Daddy'd be so happy...
9	...Oh, um...\nWho might you be?
10	Huh?!
11	What're you talking about?\nDon't you recognize us?
12	Vess doesn't remember any more.
13	Vess's not got memories from before.
14	Vess doesn't remember her past.
15	Vess's forgotten her old life.
16	I see... So Vess's memories got\nwiped after Daddy passed away...
17	And so you're her new Driver now?
18	Oh, yeah.\nThe old man, well, entrusted her to us...
19	Right. You could say the old man\nleft her to us...
20	Yes, indeed.
21	Mhm, right.
22	Well then, it's a relief that\nher new Driver is a nice person.
23	It's nice. Daddy would be happy\nknowing you're taking care of her.
24	You two are...?
25	You belong to this household, right?
26	You knew my old self?
27	This is the house our daddy used to\nlive in.
28	But just the other day, he\nmoved on from this life...
29	We haven't been back in a while,\nbut we needed to make arrangements...
30	Ah, I see. I'm sorry for your loss...
31	Can I help you in any way?
32	No, but I really appreciate you\nsaying that.
33	May I ask though, why did you\ncome here?
34	That's...\nI couldn't really tell you.
35	But when I saw this house, I felt a\nwarm wash of nostalgia...
36	Is that right...?
37	I think whoever lived here\nmust have been a great person.
38	Why do you say that?
39	Well, I...know it from looking at\nyou two.
40	After all, he raised a pair of wonderful\nchildren like you.
41	It's the sure mark of a great person.
42	...No, our daddy was just a regular guy.
43	The real great person here was the\none who raised us after our ma died.
44	Kinder and warmer than Ma ever was...
45	Where is that person now?
46	...Taking care of important business,\nI hear.
47	But we hope to meet them again,\nonce that's done.
48	We'll have so much to talk about.
49	I see.\nWell, I think that's good.
50	I'm sure they will be happy to.
51	Yeah.
52	We owe you a lot, from before.
53	I'm glad I was able to meet you.
54	That's nice...
55	So before my latest awakening,\nthis is where I lived...
56	So, whose house is this?
57	It belongs to our daddy.\nBut he passed away recently...
58	...So your father\nwould have known me, right?
59	Daddy didn't just know you.
60	He relied on you for\npretty much everything.
61	I think he'd be happy you came today.\nWherever he is now...
62	Ah, I'm sorry if I offend.\nI don't have any memory of that time...
63	I'm sorry about everything.
64	It's fine, Vess.\nPlease, think no more of it.
65	We're very happy you came today,\nregardless.
66	I almost forgot!\nHere, dumplings.
67	They may not be the best\nof offerings, but, well...
68	In any case, they're freshly made.\nPlease, help yourselves.
69	...Dumplings...
70	It's been a while...
71	I may have no memories,\nbut this is the least I can do...
72	Not at all.\nThis is perfect. Thank you.
73	Um... Would you mind terribly if I\nvisited again sometime...?
74	Of course we wouldn't mind!\nThis is your home too, after all.

23	Friend is big dumdum.\nThat book belong to me!
24	Excuse me?\nWho are you calling a dumdum?
25	Do you have any idea who\nyou're speaking to?
26	Me have no clue who you are.\nNot care either.
27	Now hurry up and hand book over!
28	You really don't know how to ask for\na favor, do you? All right, tell you what.\nI'll give you your precious book.
29	As well you should!\nSee, it not so hard to be-
30	However!\nThat's only if you manage to\nbeat me in a test of knowledge!
31	Meh-meh?\nYou think you cleverer than me?
32	Very foolish girl... But so be it!\nI not back down from challenge!
33	Good. Then we'll need a subject\ncategory.
34	Must get fair impartial opinion.\nLet us ask Driver over there to choose!
35	What would be a good topic?
36	How about the history of Argentum?
37	How about the history of Uraya?
38	What would be a good topic?
39	The history of Argentum, of course.
40	The history of Uraya, of course.
41	What would be a good topic?
42	The history of Argentum, perhaps?
43	The history of Uraya, perhaps?
44	What would be a good topic?
45	The history of Argentum, I reckon.
46	The history of Uraya, I reckon.
47	Ah yes, a wonderful idea!\nThen shall we begin?
48	It is said that Argentum was originally\nfounded by a Nopon merchant, yes?
49	Even littlepon know that. Was not just\nmerchant, either. Was Driver, too.
50	Indeed. So, this Nopon Driver...
51	Are you aware of how he used his\nBlade not as a tool of war, but as\na trade associate?
52	Wartime was very chaotic time.\nArgentum founder used Blade's\npower to great effect...
53	He go to crisis areas affected by\nstrife or disaster, and form trading\nlinks where none exist. Very profitable.
54	And that not all. Argentum founder...
55	...is said to be descended from\nnone other than Captain Nopopon.
56	Captain Nopopon was legendary\nsailor who conquer all of Cloud Sea.
57	Also said to have founded what\nlater become Nopon Trade Guild.
58	Considering the feats of his ancestor...
59	It is perhaps no wonder that this\nNopon Driver went on to found\nthe Argentum Trade Guild.
60	Very good.\nThen we begin!
61	The modern nation of Uraya...
62	...is governed by six great noble\nlines, foremost among them the\nDuchy of Selosia.
63	But long time ago, was governed by\nnot six noble houses but nine!
64	Among those nine was Duchy of Envia,\nwhich hold power near equal to\nthat of Selosia.
65	But the leader of Envia, a man\nnamed Hannes, died suddenly in\nmysterious circumstances...
66	So eldest son Giani take over Duchy,\nbut he too soon die of illness.
67	Next in line was Giani's younger\nbrother Philip, but he too died of\nillness before his twentieth birthday.
68	Thus Duchy of Envia fall from power...
69	And Duchy of Selosia unite other\nnoble houses, claiming title of\nKing of Uraya.
70	Many mysteries yet remain surrounding\nthe deaths of the Envian heirs...
71	Many still suspect foul play from\nother noble lines, yes.
72	But the tale does not end there.
73	Indeed! Prior to sudden death, Hannes,\noriginal leader of Envia, secretly had\nchild with Gormotti woman.
74	And it is often claimed that their\ndescendants live on to this day,\nsomewhere in Gormott.
75	If this theory were to be proven...
76	Could threaten very existence\nof current Urayan royal line!
77	I must say, I'm impressed.\nYour knowledge extends much\nfurther than I gave you credit for.
78	Such flattering. I just as impressed\nwith your knowledge!
79	Not many people out there\nwho able to keep up with my\nhistory discussions.
80	Shall we consider this a draw?
81	Certainly, certainly. Could not possibly\ndecide winner after such fine showing.
82	Sooooo...\nWho will be buying book then?
83	I let friend have this book.
84	Huh?
85	To be read by such fine intellectual...\nWhat more could this book ask for?
86	Thank you.\nI'll take good care of it.
87	And if we have opportunity, would\nlike to have heated discussion again!
88	As would I. I'll try to expand my\nknowledge even further by the\nnext time we meet!
89	Well, then...it looks like\nI'll be buying this.
90	Thanks very much!\nBook cost 70,000G.
91	Wow, that's surprisingly affordable...
92	Oh, shoot.
93	I'm clean out of cash.

1	Mmm! Mmhmmm!\nHeeheehee...
2	You're in a good mood, Electra.
3	Hehe, how did you know?
4	Something good must have happened,\nhuh?
5	So did something good happen?
6	I take it something good must have\nhappened?
7	Something good happen?
8	Yup! Kind of.
9	I'm just happy that there are so many\nplaces here where lightning is useful.
10	I get to really show off my stuff!
11	You've been coming along in leaps\nand bounds with your powers lately!
12	Yeah. If we didn't have you around,\nwe'd never have made it this far.
13	Yeah. If we didn't have you around,\nwe'd never have made it this far.
14	Indeed. If we didn't have you around,\nwe couldn't have made it this far.
15	Yeah. If we didn't have you around,\nwe'd never have made it this far.
16	Aww, shucks. I'm glad you all think\nI'm useful.
17	No more shocking people! Just\nuseful helping!
18	What should I say?
19	Electra, you're a real asset to the team.
20	I dunno. Pride comes before a fall...
21	What should I say?
22	You're really putting in the work,\nElectra.
23	Pride comes before a fall and all that.
24	What should I say?
25	You're very dedicated.
26	Don't rest on your laurels.
27	What should I say?
28	All because you trained hard!
29	Don't get too carried away!
30	Yeah!
31	I've still got lots of training to do before\nI can control my power fully.
32	What kind of training are you doing?
33	Well, for example...
34	Sometimes I practice producing a\nsteady, low-intensity current.
35	Oh, the other day I also used my power\nto massage a tired old lady's shoulders.
36	Y'know, just generally trying to keep\nmy powers in check!
37	Well, it sounds like you're really\ntrying hard.
38	Yep!
39	I feel like I get a little bit more\ngrown up every day.
40	That's great. We're gonna be\ncounting on you, Electra.
41	Good. We're gonna be counting on\nyou, Electra.
42	Excellent. We shall be counting on you,\nElectra.
43	Awesome. We're gonna be counting\non you, Electra!
44	I won't let you down!
45	"Dependable" is my middle name!
46	Hehe, oh don't you worry.
47	I'm gonna be real careful...
48	I promise from now on, I won't\nbe electrocuting anybody!
49	Ah...
50	What?
51	There's a bug on your back...
52	A bug?! Where is it?
53	Where is it? Where is it?\nGET IT OFF ME!
54	Hold on just a sec, I'll get it.
55	I got this.
56	Don't move a muscle. I'll get it.
57	Don't move! I've so got this!
58	Uh, um...\nI don't like this... Where did it go?

61	Aaaahhhh!

1	So! We're inside Torna's Titan now, eh?
2	The site of a grand melee\n500 years ago, yeah?
3	Uh, yeah...
4	Ah man, I wish I coulda been here\nfor that!
5	Ah, well, your memory's gone, right?\nWho knows, maybe you actually were!
6	You don't know though, do you?\nMaybe you actually were?
7	You have lost your memories.\nPerhaps you did, in fact, take part.
8	You've lost your memory, haven't you?\nSo you actually might've, you know?
9	Now that you mention it...\nThat is a very exciting possibility!
10	Hey, Mythra, maybe you remember?
11	I feel like you might...or might not...\nhave been there...
12	You're not helping!\nWhich one is it?
13	Oh, you can't expect me to remember\nevery little thing from 500 years ago!
14	...Ugh. Too bad...
15	Don't get so depressed, Zenobia.\nHey, if you had been here...
16	What should I suggest?
17	Would you have fought against Mythra?
18	Would you have been Mythra's ally?
19	Perk up, Zenobia. Say you\nwere here though...
20	What should I say?
21	Would you have fought against Mythra?
22	Would you have been Mythra's ally?
23	Don't look so despondent, Zenobia.\nIf you had been here...
24	What should I say?
25	Would you have battled Mythra?
26	Would you have been Mythra's ally?
27	Perk up, Zenobia. Hey, if you did fight\nhere...
28	What should I say?
29	Would you have fought against Mythra?
30	Would you have been Mythra's mate?
31	Good question!\nI couldn't picture it any other way!
32	Both sides would've fought tooth and\nclaw, vying to get the upper hand!
33	And I strive to be the very best, like\nno Blade was before me...
34	Under the circumstances, Mythra\nwould've been my ideal opponent!
35	How about that, Mythra?
36	What do you say, Mythra?
37	Do you agree, Mythra?
38	Anything to say to that, Mythra?
39	Hmm...
40	I imagine I would remember fighting\nagainst someone like Zenobia... So...
41	That would mean she probably\nwasn't here at that time?
42	Or if she was, maybe I just left her\nto someone else...?
43	An ally of Mythra's? Me?
44	Huh, OK.\nIt's certainly possible...
45	...Nah, there's no way!
46	Why so certain?
47	As a Blade, I aim to be\nAlrest's strongest, right?
48	No matter what shape the world\nwas in, I definitely would've wanted\nto challenge Mythra!
49	We're talking wartime here. Surely\nsuch selfish reasons wouldn't matter?
50	Nope! There's only one reason I fight!
51	There's no way that would change,\nno matter who my Driver was...
52	No matter what the circumstances,\nI live to fight strong opponents!
53	...I can't really relate, but...it certainly\nmatches who you are.
54	Well, at least she recognizes\nyour strength, right, Mythra?
55	At least she can recognize\nyour strength, eh, Mythra?
56	At the very least, your strength\nis being recognized, Mythra.
57	At least she knows who's\nthe strongest, yeah, Mythra?
58	Haha, yeah, that does feel pretty good.
59	If you keep at your dream, I'm sure\none day you'll get to be the strongest.
60	Aww, hearing you say that...\nDoesn't sound like you wanna fight me.
61	We can just go a few rounds?\nI've got to test myself against you...
62	But you just keep blowing me off...
63	It's true, Mythra doesn't seem to be\nin a mood to fight.
64	Yeah, Mythra's not really looking like\nshe's in the mood...
65	Mythra certainly doesn't appear\nto be in a fighting mood.
66	Ha, yeah, Mythra doesn't seem to be\nvery much into fightin' now...
67	Ehh, it's fine for now!
68	I'm still in training anyway.
69	I'll keep fighting alongside my Driver,\nbuilding up experience...
70	And one day, I'll take her down from\nthat pedestal she's on!
kizunatalk077_ms.json
1	Awww, yay!\nSo awesome. Woooo!
2	Just lookit!\nI'm literally speechless!
3	I never saw a view like this before.\nNot in my whole life!
4	It gladdens me to see you so enthused.\nThe view is breath-taking indeed.
5	I can't remember you getting so excited\nabout scenery, Finch.
6	But you've seen a whole bunch of stuff\nlike this...
7	Really, Finch? But you've seen all kinds\nof vistas, without reacting like this.
8	C'mon, you've seen all this wind and\nwater crap before. What's the big deal\nthis time?
9	Huh?\nReally...?
10	Uh... Maybe...?\nBut this one's just so crazy-awesome!
11	Are you sure you're not\nmisremembering?
12	Ah, that's the cool thing about all this\nadventuring business. Coming across\nstuff like this!
13	I just wanna keep doing it. I just wanna\nsee everything, discover it all!
14	Hey, Finch...
15	So what is it you want to see next?
16	You really like adventures, don't you?
17	Hey, Finch...
18	Where'd you wanna to go next?
19	You really like adventures, huh?
20	Finch.
21	What would you like to see next?
22	You have a penchant for adventures,\nI see.
23	So, Finch.
24	Where'd you want to go next?
25	You've got a wacky craving for\nadventures, don't ya?
26	Hmmm.
27	I really want to see somewhere snowy.
28	Snowy, you say...
29	Yup!\nI've never seen snow in real life before.
30	Ah, I can just imagine it. Everything all\nwhite, like a great big wedding cake.
31	But... Didn't we see rather a lot of snow\nin Tantal? We were only just there...
32	Uh? Dondle...? It had snow? Seriously?
33	Oh... Wait, wait...don't tell me...\nUmm...
34	Did like, all you guys go on the sly, and\nleave out ol' Finch here?
35	That was pretty lame of you jerks!
36	Hey! We haven't kept anything from\nyou, Finch. Dromarch, are you sure\nwe saw some snow...?
37	Hey, calm down, will you? Are you sure\nflea-bag here didn't just remember it\nwrong?
38	Finch, we never leave a man behind.\nCould Dromarch be mistaken?
39	Finch, we wouldn't do the dirty on you\nwithout a really good reason. Maybe\nDromarch just got it wrong.
40	Huh? Ah, well perhaps I am mistaken.\nThink of it that way, if it makes you feel\nbetter.
41	Bah, you guys!\nI knew you wouldn't have stabbed me\nin the back like that.
42	And for the record, if you're going off\nsomewhere, don't forget to tell \nol' Finch about it!
43	And y'know another place I wanna\nsee? A real hot place, with scorched\nearth! A fusty ol' dust bowl!
44	I feel like I'd really be able to spread\nmy wings and fly in a place like that.
45	Really... I'm not so sure.
46	Huh, whatever! Just make sure you tell\nme if you're about to go off to one of\nthose crazy-cool places!
47	Yeah! I really love 'em! It's what makes\nall this wandering about worthwhile.
48	Seeing new stuff... It's what it's all\nabout!
49	Hey... I was just saying exactly the\nsame thing, like, just a minute ago...
50	...Right?
51	Ah who cares. I'm probably just\noverthinking it!
52	Hahaha... Don't worry, Finch. We're\nused to it, and we love you all the\nsame.
53	Huh...? You guys don't seem as\nworked up about all this new stuff as\nme. Don't you like new things?
54	Nah, I mean, we like them, Finch.
55	We just don't get quite as excited as\nyou do!
56	Nah, I mean, this stuff is still kinda cool,\nFinch.
57	We just don't go nuts and flip a lid\nevery time.
58	No, seeing new things builds character,\nI can't deny that.
59	But a soldier's got to keep their dignity.
60	Don't get me wrong, Finch, it's good to\nsee something new.
61	But some of us have super-cool,\nice-man reps to maintain.
62	Seriously?
63	Indeed, Finch.
64	You have your own...very loud...way\nof rejoicing. It's one of your\ncharacteristics.
65	Uh... I... I don't...r-really get when you...\nEh, who cares!
66	But anyhow... Let's hurry on to the\nnext great discovery! I can't wait!
67	Everyone good to go?
68	Very much so!\nLet us venture forth!
69	Yeah! Woohoo!
70	Look! Lookit!
71	Get a load of that scenery!\nNever seen that before!
72	Huh?
73	Hey, can't you see that killer view,\nBromarch? It rocks!
74	What... Did you forget already?
75	Forget?\nForget what?
76	Hahaha!
77	Finch, I don't think we'll ever get bored\nwhile you're around!
78	Hahaha!
79	We'll never be short of entertainment\nwith you around, Finch.
80	Hahaha!
81	Every platoon needs someone like you,\nFinch.
82	Hahaha!
83	You're an absolute classic, Finch.
84	Wh-What are you talking about?\nYou're all weird...
kizunatalk078_ms.json
1	View here pretty amazing...
2	I would never have dreamed\na day would come when I could\ngaze down upon all of Alrest...
3	Though I must confess, the sheer\nheight sets my fur on end somewhat.
4	Master, tell me. What do you\nfeel, standing here?
5	What's going through my mind?
6	What if the World Tree falls over?!
7	How was this place even constructed?
8	What's going through my mind?
9	Crap, what if this Tree falls over?
10	How was this thing even built?
11	What is going through my mind?
12	What if the World Tree were felled?
13	How was the Tree originally built?
14	What's going through my head?
15	Boy, would it suck if this thing fell over.
16	How was the World Tree even built?
17	This place really is super high up...
18	Sometimes I wonder what would\nhappen if the Tree fell over.
19	This place is crazy high up, right?
20	It's scary to think what would happen\nif the World Tree fell over.
21	We are standing at an\nincredible altitude here.
22	The thought of what would happen if\nthe World Tree were to collapse...\nIt has troubled me more than once.
23	Well, I mean, we're crazy high up here.
24	So I get to thinking, what if this tree\nfalls over? Pretty scary thought, right?
25	Why say such scary things?!
26	Now you mention, Tree very thin for\nso tall structure! Not seem very stable!
27	If the Tree did fall...I expect none\nof us would survive, would we?
28	The chances of impact with Alrest from\nour current location seem very small.
29	On lower levels of the Tree, such as\nwhere you faced Amalthus and Jin,\nthe structure could indeed topple.
30	But this is outer space. We are in\norbit above Alrest's atmosphere.
31	Even if the World Tree itself were to\ncollapse, our current location would\nmost likely hold its position.
32	That's...hard to imagine.
33	Uhhh... I don't think I get it.
34	Your claims are difficult to\ncomprehend...
35	Not sure I get it, but if you say so.
36	That good though. If we safe up\nhere even if Tree topples, that\nis load off Tora's mind!
37	In that event, though, how would\nwe return to Alrest?
38	Meh-meh-meh?! KOS-MOS, you have\nanswer to that too, right?!
39	Either we would remain in orbit for\nall eternity, or we would break free\nand fly off into outer space.
40	Either way, then, this place would\nbecome our grave...
41	Precisely.
42	...Tora maybe want to go home now.
43	Do not worry.
44	I will do all I can to avoid such a\nsituation transpiring. Protecting\nDrivers is my duty as a Blade.
45	Tora not actually real Driver though.\nJust Nopon boy.
46	...
47	I will protect you after I have ensured\nthe safety of Rex, Nia, Mòrag, and Zeke.
48	Meh-meh-meh?! Fifth in line?!
49	If you wish to be treated as top priority,\nI suggest you turn to Poppi instead.
50	KOS-MOS too cruel!
51	Hahaha! You're actually pretty\nfunny sometimes, KOS-MOS.
52	Hahahah! You're a regular\nriot, KOS-MOS.
53	Ahaha... You can be quite\namusing at times, KOS-MOS.
54	Hahahah! You're a funny gal,\nyou know that, KOS-MOS?
55	Really? I was merely expressing\nthe factual state of affairs...
56	Well, sometimes it's funnier\nwhen it comes naturally!
57	No, I get that... But that\njust makes it even better!
58	Oh, I appreciate that. But that's\npart of what makes it so funny.
59	Yeah, but that just makes it\neven funnier, y'know?
60	Well, the first step would be to launch\na satellite into orbit above Alrest.
61	Yes, yes...?
62	Once the satellite reaches geostationary\norbit, it lowers a cable towards Alrest.
63	Next, it extends a weighted cable\nin the opposite direction.
64	Intriguing...
65	By alternately extending the two,\neventually the downward cable\nwill reach the surface.
66	Next, a device can be attached to this\ncable to carry materials to the satellite.
67	Yes, yes...?
68	And by gradually expanding the\nscale of the structure, the World\nTree begins to take shape.
69	Tora sort of see what KOS-MOS mean.\nBut mostly sound like nonsense.
70	Yes, I'm afraid I could barely\ncomprehend it at all.
71	How do you know all this stuff,\nKOS-MOS?
72	Where are you getting all this\nfrom, KOS-MOS?
73	How do you know all these\ncomplex things, KOS-MOS?
74	Listen, KOS-MOS... How d'you\neven know about this stuff?
75	That...I don't know myself.
76	KOS-MOS not know?
77	Correct.
78	This data exists independently from\nmy ordinary memories.
79	It does not seem to be lost even\nwhen I return to my Core Crystal.
80	Just as we Blades remember our names\nwhen we are newly awakened, this\ninformation has always been with me.
81	As such, I cannot say who\nimplanted this information\ninto me, or for what purpose.
82	I guess there are things even\nyou don't know, huh.
83	So there's stuff even you don't\nknow, huh.
84	So there are some things even\nyou don't know.
85	I guess there's some stuff even\nyou don't know.
86	Indeed.
87	Perhaps that is my purpose here.\nTo seek the answers I do not have.
kizunatalk079_ms.json
1	So, you have awakened the sealed\nBlade.
2	Your Majesty...
3	Your Majesty...
4	King Eulogimenos...
5	Old man...
6	It's been quite some time since I last\nsaw this place.
7	We used to play here as children, you\nknow...
8	...
9	Tell me, do you know why it is that\nTheospiti Temple was destroyed?
10	I haven't a clue.
11	Beats me.
12	I'm afraid I do not.
13	I know it's been in ruins since forever,\nbut no one ever told me why.
14	It's because a Blade went berserk.
15	They say that the Blade was so\npowerful, its Driver couldn't hope\nto control it.
16	There was nothing anyone could do.\nThe incident was resolved when the\nDriver took their own life.
17	With that, the Blade was sealed\nwithin its Core Crystal.
18	And as a warning to future generations,\nit was buried here in the temple where\nthe tragedy took place.
19	You mean, the Blade that went\nberserk is...
20	You mean, the Blade that went\nberserk is...
21	You mean, the Blade that went\nberserk is...
22	You mean, the Blade that went\nberserk is...
23	Your suspicions are correct. The Blade\nwas Herald.
24	I have no memory of the event...\nBut I believe it to be true.
25	At times, I feel something.
26	A kind of...limitless power, dwelling\nwithin me.
27	Your Majesty, you may punish me\nhowever you see fit.
28	Even if it means breaking my Core\nCrystal into a thousand pieces and\nburying me for all eternity.
29	How should I answer Herald?
30	I'll respect your decision.
31	I'll keep you in check.
32	How should I answer Herald?
33	I'll respect your decision.
34	I'll keep you in check.
35	How should I answer Herald?
36	I'll respect your decision.
37	I'll keep you in check.
38	How should I answer Herald?
39	I'll respect your decision.
40	I'll keep you in check.
41	Thank you.
42	Well then, Your Majesty.
43	Wait. I think it is a little early to\npronounce judgment just yet.
44	And if the legends speak truth, you,\nHerald, could be a valuable asset in\nthe wars to come.
45	Now, your Driver is the bearer of\ngreat aptitude and strength.
46	Above all else, they possess an\nunyielding will.
47	And need we mention that they are\nacting alongside the Aegis?
48	Your Driver today is the very opposite\nof your Driver of yesteryear. You will\nnot run wild.
49	So, I did not come here today to\nseal you away.
50	No, all I ask is that you wield your\npower as you see fit, and that you\nserve your Driver well.
51	...
52	Herald...?
53	Herald...?
54	Herald...?
55	Herald...?
56	Understood.
57	If that's what it takes to repent for\nmy sins, then so be it.
58	Dear, oh dear. It seems it's going to\ntake a while for her to understand.
59	Take care of her.
60	Sure. You can count on me!
61	Sure. You can count on me!
62	Leave it to me, Your Majesty.
63	Sure. You can count on me!
64	Rex...
65	Nia...
66	Mòrag...
67	Zeke...
68	Ha ha! Just as I thought.
69	Listen well, Herald.
70	I believe your Driver trusts you deeply.
71	And I trust your Driver just the same.
72	Even if you had some recollection of\nthe past, you need not dwell on it.
73	Don't let yourself be chained to the\npast. Become your Driver's strength.
74	That's all I ask.
75	But still, I have to atone somehow...
76	I understand how you feel, but you\nmust remember that there are many\nways to atone for one's sins.
77	Aiding your Driver in the fierce battles\nto come is one such way.
78	You think so...?
79	Yeah, we need you, Herald.
80	Don't trap yourself in the past. Come\nwith us. We'll fight together.
81	Yeah, we need you, Herald.
82	No point crying over spilled milk.\nCome with us. Fight with us!
83	That's right. We need you, Herald.
84	The past is the past. You should leave\nit behind and fight at our side.
85	Yeah, we need you, Herald.
86	What happened, happened. But now,\nwe want you on our side. Come with\nus!
87	...All right.
88	I'll try.
89	Worry not. Whatever happens, just\nremember: you have an esteemed\nDriver by your side.
90	Your Majesty...thank you.
91	Think nothing of it. I expect great\nthings of you.

1	Hey, Vale! Is something up?
2	You're not sick are you?
3	Hey, Vale! What's up?
4	You'd better not be sick!
5	Vale. Still fighting fit, I hope.
6	Yo! Vale!\nWhat's going down?
7	Are you sick? By which I mean, "ill".
8	Vale! Sun already up!
9	Wakey-wakey!
10	Is something wrong?
11	Vale not wakey-wake.
12	Maybe...
13	I mean, I do remember her saying she\nwasn't much of a morning person.\nMaybe she's still sleeping.
14	Should I go and wake her up?
15	Yeah, OK.
16	Yeah. Do it.
17	Yes. Please do.
18	Yeah, get that sleepyhead out of bed!
19	Uh... W-what's...happening...?
20	Well, she's conscious, but she doesn't\nexactly look...awake...
21	Ughhh... Can you stop making such\na racket when I'm trying to sleep?
22	How long were you planning to keep\ndozing? C'mon, it's morning already!
23	We need to get ready to go.
24	C'mon, sleeping beauty. Wake up and\nsmell the coffee.
25	And get your arse in gear!
26	Plenty of time to sleep when you're\ndead.
27	The sun's up. Time to get ready to\nmove out.
28	How long are you going to sleep for,\nkiddo?
29	C'mon. Out of bed. Embrace the day.
30	Huh? Morning?\nSeriously?
31	Nah. I'm going to sleep for a bit longer,\nthanks.
32	Hey! Don't go back to sleep!
33	Oh no you don't! Come on, up you get!
34	Vale. It's time to get up, I said.
35	Hey! What's wrong with you!\nNaptime's over!
36	It's morning? So what. There's a new\none every single day, y'know.
37	I didn't get to sleep till the sun came\nup. Leave me to it, will you.
38	What should I ask her...?
39	Vale, why are you so terrible at getting\nup?
40	Why didn't you get to sleep until\nmorning?
41	What should I ask her...?
42	Vale, what is it with you and mornings?
43	What kept you up so late?
44	What should I ask her...?
45	How come you're such a weakling\nwhen it comes to mornings?
46	Why were you so late to bed?
47	What should I ask her...?
48	How come you're such a lazybones in\nthe morning?
49	What kept you up so late?
50	Uh?
51	Well, thing is, I'm actually a...\na nightstalker.
52	?!
53	Wow! A nightstalker!\nTora amazed!
54	So does Vale have special reaction to\nsunlight?
55	Yup. Sunlight has this strange effect on\nme. I lose power. I disappear.
56	Wow! Awesome!
57	Yes! Awesome!
58	That's the deal. So you'd better let me\nget some sleep.
59	Thing is, there's this thing inside me.\nThe Geist Chevalier.
60	You'd better be careful. It can run riot.
61	Geist Chevalier?
62	Run riot?
63	That's right. If I don't get enough rest,\nthen I can't control it. So if you don't\nwant it to go crazy...
64	...it's naptime.
65	Hey! That won't wash! It's time to go!
66	Hey! That nonsense won't work.\nC'mon!
67	Very funny. Time to go!
68	Vale, if you don't get your butt in gear,\nwe're leaving without you.
69	Hmph... Worth a try.
70	I had this kind of secret meeting thing\nin the night.
71	Secret meeting, huh?
72	Yep. I met up with some buddies. We\ngot into some pretty dark magical\nsummoning stuff.
73	Ah, now I get it. You met up with your\ngirlfriends and spent the night chatting?
74	N-no! It was a really important magic\nthing.
75	That's not what Mythra told me.
76	She said you were having a little\nchat-fest with everyone.
77	Ah! Mythra! Why'd you snitch on me?!\nBig mouth...
78	...What kind of stuff friends\ntalk about, anyway?
79	Uh...never mind.
80	※削除
81	Let me see... You were just talking\nabout what your favorite dessert was,\nright?
82	Mythra! Argh! Why I'm gonna...
83	Mythra? Are you in there?\nOr is it just Pyra?
84	Well, whatever! Both of you are on\npretty thin ice right now!
85	Vale, if you don't come along now,\nI'm going to tell them the rest...
86	That's from Mythra.
87	Urgh... Wait! Wait. I got it. I'm coming!\nI'm coming, OK?!
88	Just don't say anything else...
kizunatalk081_ms.json
1	Something wrong, Agate?
2	What's up, Agate?
3	Is everything OK, Agate?
4	What's the deal, Agate?
5	Take a look at this.
6	...The walls and floors of these ruins...\nWhat do you think they're made of?
7	Just rocks?
8	I thought so too, at first. Just regular\nstone, hewn and stacked, right? But...
9	With natural materials, processed and\nput together, you'd expect some flaws,\nsome deformations somewhere...
10	And with this ruin shooting up into the\nsky like this...even small variations at\nground level would cause it to tilt over.
11	So how do you think it was made?
12	What's your theory, then?
13	In that case, what do you think\nis the origin?
14	So how do you reckon it got made?
15	Well, the treated blocks were stacked\nup into the sky, with perfect accuracy\nand no errors. That much is true.
16	But the strength of it is unparalleled.
17	Over hundreds, thousands, or tens of\nthousands of years, the walls and\nfloors didn't break or become brittle...
18	Amazing work by people from age past!
19	At our level of technology,\nit's unimaginable.
20	I marvel at the minerals and materials\nused to create this site, though I don't\npretend to understand them...
21	The whole World Tree is a mystery,\nfor sure...
22	What should I say?
23	You sound pretty thrilled.
24	No bugs around here, eh?
25	What should I say?
26	You seem pretty excited.
27	Seems relatively bug-free.
28	How shall I proceed?
29	You seem quite thrilled.
30	There don't seem to be any bugs here.
31	What do I say now?
32	Someone sounds excited!
33	No bugs here, eh...?
34	Obviously!
35	I'm curious about the construction,\nof course, but more than that, I love\nthe adventure of it!
36	Just thinking about the ancient people\nwho built this place, about their hopes\nand dreams...
37	And these symbols I can't read... Are\nthey knowledge? Are they a warning?
38	All these objects made of materials\nI've never seen before!
39	Just being here makes me feel so alive,\nmakes my mind soar!
40	I understand completely!
41	Yeah, I think I know what you mean.
42	Hah...\nI feel like I understand.
43	I get that!\nBang on.
44	I can't even imagine how many people\nhad to work on making a building as\nenormous as this one...
45	Even just this wall probably took\ndozens of people hours, if not days...
46	All of these people's blood, sweat and\ntears, sealed in these walls of stone.
47	This place stands as a testament to\nthe wills of those who came before.
48	This place is like a crystallization of\nthe ancients' wills.
49	That would make this place a\ncrystallization of their wills.
50	So this place is like a testament to\nthe wills of the ancient people.
51	Hah, that's a nice way to put it.
52	But yes, this wonderful lasting tribute\nis one of a kind on Alrest.
53	We should make sure to search the\nruins thoroughly and find all we can\nabout the ancient inhabitants!
54	Hey!\nYou almost sound disappointed!
55	I for one am quite glad that the inside\nof the World Tree is a bug-free zone!
56	You know, since it's called a tree, I was\nafraid there might be all sorts of creepy\ncrawlies nesting here...
57	Oh, is that why you were exploring so\nhappily?
58	So that's why you were so cheerful\nwhile exploring!
59	Is that why your spirits were so high?
60	Ah, so that's why you're so\nbloody jolly!
61	Exactly!
62	I love minerals, like, a lot! And I hate\nbugs about the same amount...
63	In fact, I think that the more I love\ngeology, the more I hate bugs.
64	That's a lot of hate then. I wonder how\nyou'd handle diving in the Cloud Sea...
65	I fail to see the connection...
66	That's...an interesting rationalization.
67	That's a hell of a theory...
68	Sorry to keep Masterpon waiting!
69	Ah, Poppi, just in time!\nMasterpon starving.
70	Poppi collected only best ingredients.
71	What could you possibly collect\nin a place like this...?
72	What did you find?
73	Whatcha got, then?\nCan I have some?
74	What have you found?
75	So, what's for dinner then?\nI want some too!
76	Is delicacy when fried!\nJabara Bugs!
77	Get them awayyyyyy!!!

1	Oh, how splendid.
2	Will you take a look at that view!\nThat's quite some natural beauty,\nright there.
3	Yeah, I can't imagine seeing a view\nquite like this anywhere else.
4	Yeah, you don't see a view like this\nevery day, that's for sure.
5	I quite agree. A view this beautiful\nis a rare and remarkable sight.
6	Yep, it's a rare sight all right. You don't\nsee a view like this just anywhere.
7	I'm a little surprised you appreciate\nthis kind of beauty though, Dahlia.
8	I thought you liked things\na little more...flashy.
9	Ohoho... You're sharp, Brighid, hon,\nbut not sharp enough.
10	Sure, I'm a big fan of extravagant\nbeauty, but there's somethin' extra\nspecial about the beauty o' nature.
11	The beauty of nature?
12	You mean, things are more beautiful\nin their natural state?
13	Pretty much. If you can be beautiful\nwithout even tryin'...
14	Ain't that just the purest beauty of all?
15	Hmm... Is that right?
16	I mean, look at Poppi. Does she put\nany effort into how she looks? Naw.\nBut she's still a total sweetheart.
17	I suppose that's true.
18	There's any number o' ways to\nspruce yourself up an' make\nyourself look beautiful.
19	But that's just smoke an' mirrors.\nMaking the surface look good while\nignoring what's underneath.
20	So I figure real beauty is the stuff that\nhappens naturally, without any o' that.
21	What should I say to Dahlia?
22	Either way, you're pretty beautiful.
23	Why is nature so important to you?
24	What should I say to Dahlia?
25	You're pretty beautiful anyway, though.
26	Why're you so keen on nature?
27	What should I say to Dahlia?
28	You seem quite beautiful, in any case.
29	Why are you so concerned with nature?
30	What should I say to Dahlia?
31	Either way, you're a stunner.
32	Why're you so crazy about nature?
33	Why, thank you, hon!\nBut I've still got a long way to go.
34	Like I said before, it's not enough to\njust look good on the outside.
35	Like, say if I was to scarf down\nall your breakfasts by myself,\nwould you think I was beautiful then?
36	Or if I ran away in the middle of battle,\nleavin' my Driver behind.
37	To be really beautiful, you've gotta\nstart from what's inside.
38	The beauty that flows forth naturally\nfrom a person, both inside and out...\nThat's what I'm strivin' for.
39	That's why my goal is to never\nhide behind decorations an'\nalways show my true self.
40	Oh, that makes sense. That's a\npretty cool philosophy to live by.
41	Oh, I get it. Pretty neat philosophy\nto live by, I guess.
42	Interesting. I feel this philosophy\ncaptures your essence quite well.
43	Oh right, I get it. Yeah, that's not\na bad philosophy to live by.
44	Then maybe you'd like to join me, hon?\nWe can better our true selves together!
45	Keen on nature, huh?\nI never really thought about it,\nbut I guess you could say I am.
46	I mean, you humans age as the\nyears go by, right?
47	Gals especially tend to really hate that,\nfeelin' like it's just makin' them uglier,\nbut me, I think it's a beautiful thing.
48	An aging body's a sign of the long life\nyou've lived, and a mark of all the\nexperiences you've been through, right?
49	So I figure that's a unique form\no' natural beauty, too.
50	So it's like...a human life itself is a\nwork of art created by nature?
51	That's a pretty cool philosophy.
52	So what, each human life is another\none of nature's works of art?
53	Pretty neat way of looking at it.
54	So each human life is a work of art\ncreated by the bounty of nature?
55	That's an admirable way of putting it.
56	Oh, I get it. So like, each human life\nis one of nature's works of art?
57	Pretty classy way of looking at it.
58	Bein' a Blade, I wasn't born from\nnature like you humans are.
59	I came into the world lookin' this way,\nand when my Driver dies, I'll disappear\nlookin' just the same.
60	Us Blades never change, and we\nfade away all too suddenly.
61	I guess that's why I kind of admire\nthe natural, fleeting beauty you humans\nhave.
62	I'm glad you're my Driver, hon.\nI can already imagine how gracefully\nyou'll age over the years.
63	I almost can't wait to see it! Hahaha.

2	Can't use Nopon as muscle...
3	And I can't just ask the Ardainians...
4	Mm? Oh, hi. Well, actually...
5	I've got some cargo in the harbor that\nI brought from Uraya to trade, but...
6	It's an ever-so-slight nuisance...
7	What shall we ask?
8	Ask if someone's causing trouble
9	Ask if the cargo is illegal
10	That's a good guess!
11	Except it's not exactly a person...
12	Ah, no, nothing like that!
13	I don't have the stomach for crime.
14	It seems that Trent Krabbles\nlove the stuff I'm transporting.
15	To get to it, they clamber on deck and\ntry to steal the cargo...
16	I hired some goons to stand guard,\nbut they all got done in.
17	So I'm out here now, looking for\nsomeone to replace 'em with...
18	But I'm having no luck so far,\nso it's starting to feel a bit dire...
19	You're saying you'll take the job?
20	Thanks a bunch, pal!\nYou're one in a million!
21	The cargo's in Goldmouth Return Port.\nIt's pretty large, you can't miss it.

4	So when everyone's havin' fun at the\nwaterside, I just stand here feeling daft.
5	I'd like to practice my swimming,\nbut without the equipment I need,\nit's all a bit tough.
6	I heard about a plant that grows on\nCoolley Lake, called Buoyweed.
7	It floats on water, so it'd be perfect\nfor swimming lessons, but...
8	There's monsters near where\nBuoyweed grows, so I can't just pick it.
9	I nearly got ate last time I tried...
10	You'll pick some for me?!
11	Well, three of them should be enough\nto keep me afloat.
12	Thanks a bunch!
13	I saw the Buoyweed around the middle\nof Coolley Lake last time.
14	Lemme know once you get three!
qst000402_ms.json
1	You brought the Buoyweed...?
2	Thanks!\nI'll be able to practice now!
3	I'll just tie it to myself and safely\nfloat!

5	I bet I'll be swimming in no time.

2	...Ugh.\nI'm fine, I'm fine...\nLet's just keep going...
3	What're you saying?!\nWith those wounds? We should\ngo back to town and...
4	What are YOU saying?\nWe can't go back...
5	B-but...
6	...I guess asking you guys\nis our best shot.
7	The thing is, we... Our marriage\nhas met with some opposition.
8	Our only option was to elope, so we\nheaded out to Umon's Shipyard...
9	We thought if we could rent a boat,\nwe could leave Gormott behind...
10	In the past, Mor Ardain very nearly\neradicated Rhiannon's ancestral clan.
11	That's why my da hates all\nArdainians with a fiery passion.
12	Not that Norman, or most Ardainians\nfor that matter, had anything to do with\nthat atrocity...
13	And we love each other!\nWhy would he deny our beautiful love?
14	I can see where Rhiannon's parents\nare coming from, but- Urk...
15	Norman! Norman!\nPlease, stay with us!
16	Please! You have to help him!
17	Oh, thank you!
18	First, could you gather some\nShepherd's Purses and Dawn\nHydrangeas?
19	You'll find an apothecary called Nils in\nTorigoth. He'll make us a medicine...
20	Nils, he's...my brother. He knows\nabout our plan, so he should be\nhappy to help...
21	I'll try to keep Norman stable,\nbut please, hurry!

1	U-ugh...
qst000505_ms.json
1	Mh, yes, I am Rhiannon's brother.\nHas something happened?
2	Oh...\nSo she did try to run away in the end...
3	I can make the medicine, no problem.\nI just wonder if eloping is really the\nonly way...
4	I just want my sister to be happy,\nof course. But I can't convince myself\nthat running is her best option...
5	...
6	Hey, could I ask you a favor, too?
7	While I prep the medicine, how about\nyou go to our parents' house and hear\nthem out?
8	I'd go myself, but, well, I can't.\nI got disinherited.
9	If I showed up, the whole thing might\nget even more muddled...
10	Our da's a stubborn old goat.\nThickheaded as anything.
11	Now Ma, on the other hand, less so.\nBut she does generally side with him\non everything...
12	Thanks!\nThey live in Grodd Residential Zone.
13	Right, I'll get to it then.\nI should have the medicine ready\nwhen you're back.
14	Our pig-headed parents have a house in\nGrodd Residential zone.
15	Why don't you go talk to them\nwhile I prepare the medicine?
16	Hey, welcome back.\nI just finished with the medicine.
17	So? What did they say?
18	...I see.\nYep, still stubborn...
19	It might just be because they\nworry about us, their kids...
20	I really don't know what the\nright answer is here...
21	Well, the future is a distant and murky\nthing, and nobody knows what will be.
22	...Uh, no time for this, though, is there.\nHere, take this medicine to Rhiannon,\nand quickly.
23	She'll know what to do with it.\nGood luck.
24	Please take the medicine to Rhiannon.\nGood luck.
qst000506_ms.json
1	Ahh...\nSo you're Rhiannon's friends!
2	Well, do you need something from us?
3	Husband! Wyn!\nIt's terrible! Rhiannon's eloped and-
4	Eloped...?!
5	Hmph... Just leave it.\nA daughter who would associate with\nan Ardainian is no daughter of mine!
6	Do you realize you might never see\nRhiannon again?
7	...She's already gone, hasn't she?\nLeave it, I say.
8	Do you think she'll be happy like that,\nrunning away from everything she's\never known?
9	Do you not give a damn for your\nown child's happiness?
10	Quiet! Of course I want her\nto be happy!
11	But approve of her running around\nwith an Ardainian? Bah! Over my\ndead body!
12	You know what Ardainians did to\nthis land, don't you?
13	It's all in the past! It has nothing to do\nwith the children of today!
14	Even so, I'm not having it...
15	Oh, you stubborn old fool...
16	When Nils went to Mor Ardain to\nstudy medicine, you went and\ndisinherited him too.
17	But then you still sent Rhiannon to\ncheck on her brother, didn't you?\nDespite all you say, you do love them...
18	Hmph...
19	I don't care how you dress it up,\nI'm not changing my mind!
20	Even if it means never seeing my\ndaughter again, I'll have...

1	Oh!
2	Why, if it isn't a Driver! Just who I\nwas hoping to see.
3	Well, you see, I've got loads of fruit\nnow, thanks to this bumper harvest.
4	I was just thinking I'd use it to make\nmy famous fruit pie. Everyone gets a\nslice!
5	I don't mean to brag, but everyone who\ntries my pie says it's something special.
6	Yes, ask anyone. Twaina's pie, the\ntastiest in all of Torigoth!
7	My husband nearly bursts his breeches\nstuffing himself when I make it.
8	It was because of my pies that he\nwanted to marry me, he said.
9	Oh, I'm sorry, I got a little bit carried\naway blowing my own trumpet there.
10	So the problem is, I'm actually\na bit short of some of the things\nI need for my pie.
11	The traders round here are hopeless\nfor ingredients, so I was hoping some\nkind person would get them for me.
12	That's very kind of you.
13	Could you get me a nice bit of\nHustle Hyacinth and some Mint Fish?
14	It's just not the same without those\nspecial ingredients.
15	Hello there. How are you?
16	It's Hustle Hyacinth and Mint Fish\nI'm after. Have you got it yet?
17	Well, I'm sure you'll find some sooner\nor later!
18	Hello! Did you get those ingredients\nyet?
19	Oh! Thank you so very much!
20	Thanks to you I'll be able to make my\nincredible pie!
21	Well... I would be able to, if my stove\nhadn't broken down.
22	We've got this custom-made stove at\nhome, you see. It's a real devil to fix\nwhen it breaks.
23	And it's always breaking down...
24	My husband's usually the one who\nsorts it out for me.
25	It's one of those funny old machines\nwhich needs a tender touch. It reminds\nme of why I married him...
26	Yes, actually, he's not just good with\nstoves... One time, this really nasty\nBunnit came into town, and he...
27	Oh, look at me, I'm getting carried\naway chatting again.
28	Now what was I talking about...?
29	Oh yes... Getting that funny old stove\nfixed.
30	My husband's out cutting wood, and I\ndon't know when he'll be back. So I'm\nnot sure how to get that stove fixed.
31	You aren't any good at fixing stoves,\nare you?
32	Ah! I've had a brainwave!
33	Why don't you lot go and find the\ncraftsman who built our stove and bring\nhim here?
34	His name's Glyn. You'll find\nhim at Torigoth Market, I bet.
35	I'm so sorry to keep asking you to do\nme all these favors... But could you\ngo and get him for me?
36	Oh, thank you so much! I'll give you\nsomething really nice if you take care\nof this...
37	Glyn's over at Torigoth Market, I\ndare say.
38	Thanks for doing it. I'm terrible with\nall these requests, aren't I?
qst000602_ms.json
1	Oh, what's up? Got a bit of a\njob for me, have you?
2	Oh, I see. Twaina needs her stove\nsorted out again, does she? Well, I'm\nyour man!
3	The cost of the work'll be about\n3,000G, I'd say.
4	I'll need payment up front, though...\nI'm a bit of a stickler for that.
5	It's my wife, see. She goes bananas\nwhen I give people credit.
6	Honestly, I'm more scared of getting it\nin the ear from her than this bloody\nTitan falling down!
7	So, if you don't mind, I need paying\nfirst, for the sake of my sanity.
8	Although... Maybe there is one way\nI could do it for nothing...
9	There's something I wanted to give to\nmy wife, you see.
10	She's pretty fierce, but she does right\nby me, she does.
11	So, I wanted to get her this nifty little\nthing called a Chain of Keys. They\ndon't sell any round here though.
12	Maybe you salvagers could fish one\nup from somewhere. That's the sort\nof thing you do, isn't it?
13	Yes, get me a Chain of Keys, and\nI'll call it quits on fixing the stove.
14	I'll be happy with the cash, if you can't\nfind one, though.
15	Either way, I'm a happy chappy. Let me\nknow when you've got it sorted!
16	So, did you get it sorted out then?
17	Which will you give?
18	Give the money
19	Give the Chain of Keys
20	The price is the same as I said before.\n3,000G to be exact.
21	Thanks a lot.
22	The job's over at Twaina's place, you\nsaid?
23	I'll head over there and get her stove\nfixed then. See you later!
24	Oh, thank you ever so much.\nThat's a really big help to me.
25	I'd never have been able to get\nsomething like this with the little bit of\nmoney the wife lets me spend.
26	I'll head over to Twaina's and get her\nstove fixed then.
27	It'll be right as rain in no time!
28	Er, you don't seem to have the goods.
29	It's a Chain of Keys that I'm after.
30	Or 3,000G. That'll do as well.
31	Either one's fine. Just come back and\nlet me know when you've got it sorted.
32	Pay 3,000G?
33	Pay
34	Don't pay
qst000603_ms.json
1	Oh, there you are! The repairs are all\ndone and dusted now.
2	Do it right, fast, and cheap! That's my\nmotto! It doesn't rhyme or anything.\nBut it's still a good motto!
3	Oh! Hello there, Driver! Thanks for\nhelping me out so much!
4	He's fixed up that stove so well you'd\nthink it was brand-new!
5	Oh, it makes me think of the day my\nhusband brought it home, it does...
6	Nice to think that this stove is still going\nstrong, like our marriage!
7	Well, my husband's going to be home\nsoon. So I'd best get cracking on this\npie!
8	It's a family secret, this pie, y'know.\nPassed down through the generations.
9	Ooh... There I go again... Once I start\ntalking, I can't stop!
10	I said I'd give you a little something for\ngoing to all that trouble, didn't I...
11	I don't think it'll be enough to just let\nyou have a slice of pie...
12	So I'll give you the recipe!
13	Now you'll be able to make my fancy\npie any time you like... It's not easy,\nmind!
14	Thank you so much!
qst000701_ms.json
1	Ohhhh... There's gotta be someone\nwho can help... I don't wanna lose...
2	Oh! Hey, you there!\nYeah, you!
3	Listen, have you heard of this pale\nbeetle called the Snow-White Rhino?
4	I've got a bet going with my mate\nLeif to see who can find one first...
5	But just recently, I heard\nsomething awful.
6	Apparently Leif asked this old guy\nhe knows to go find a Snow-White\nRhino beetle for him!
7	I mean, sure, Seigle Fell is\ndangerous for kids, but come on!\nSeriously?! Unfair, right?
8	What do we think?
9	Agree it's unfair
10	Say Eluned should get his own beetle
11	Right?\nSeriously!
12	That's why I want you to go and\nfetch a Snow-White Rhino for me too!
13	This has just become a proxy war.
14	If Leif's gonna use a mean trick\nlike this, then so will I.
15	My mam's no help - she tells me not to\ngo anywhere dangerous, but then she\ntells me not to let him beat me, too!
16	Anyway, this is real lucky for me.\nYou'll help out, right?
17	What?!\nN-no way!
18	Snow-White Rhinos live near\nSeigle Fell, which is meant to be\nreally dangerous!
19	Even grownups have got badly hurt\ngoing there! If I went, I'd come back\nin tiny little bits!
20	What's with the face? Oh, so you\nthink I shouldn't have bet on it, then?\nIs that it?
21	I had to, buddy!
22	My mam always tells me, you can't\nback down from a challenge...
23	And once you've accepted one,\nyou do what it takes to win!
24	So please! Please get a Snow-White\nRhino for me? Pretty please?
25	Awesome! Thanks!
26	Snow-White Rhinos like to hang\nabout near Seigle Fell, down near\nthe tail end of Gormott.
27	Oh, but apparently they only come out\nearly in the morning...
28	That's basically all I know. Eh, you'll\nwork it out I'm sure!
29	I'll make sure to have some sort of\nreward ready for you. Look forward\nto it!
30	Didja find that Snow-White Rhino yet?
31	You can find 'em near Seigle Fell,\ntowards Gormott's tail.
32	But be careful, 'cos they only come out\nearly in the morning.
33	Good luck!

6	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]A Snow-White Rhino!!!
7	[ML:Feeling ]Amazing! So awesome!\nYou really went and got one!
8	Man, is there anything Drivers can't do?
9	I gotta go show Leif right away!
10	C'mon, let's go to Garagorm's Arch!\nLeif's always loafing there!
qst000703_ms.json
1	I won! I won against Leif!\nLook, he's so mad I managed\nto beat him! Haha!
2	Maybe it was just a stroke of luck\nthat I met you Drivers, but...
3	Well, I managed to do what\nmy mam said, so at the end\nof the day, I'm happy!
4	Oh, yeah. Here, with my thanks.
5	Actually, my mam wanted you\nto have this, too.
6	Thanks a bunch!
qst000704_ms.json
1	Fiddlesticks! Tweedlebum!\nHow could I lose to Eluned?!
2	I can't believe he actually got one!
3	Ah, but at least I saw a\nSnow-White Rhino with my own eyes...
4	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]It's so emotional...
qst000801_ms.json
1	It's snapped in two... I guess they used\nit to try and open this chest, but failed?
2	Wait, there's something written on it...
3	Huh, it's broken. Looks like someone\nused it to try and prize open the\nchest. Unsuccessfully.
4	There are some markings on the hilt...
5	It's snapped clean in two. Looks like\nsome rascal tried to open the chest\nwith it. Didn't get very far, though...
6	Hello? There's something written\non it.
7	Knife is all broken in half!\nMaybe someone try to open chest\nwith knife, but it not work?
8	Meh-meh? It have words on holdy bit!
9	The blade seems to be broken.\nSomeone must have tried to open the\nchest, but clearly to no avail.
10	Hmm? There are words on the hilt...
11	"Wealth and fortune to Erebos, dearest\ngrandson."
12	Looks important. If we ever come\nacross the owner, we'll have to ask\nthem about it.
13	Looks important. If we ever come\nacross the owner, we'll have to ask\nthem about it.
14	A treasured item, eh? If we ever come\nacross the owner, I'm sure they'll have\na story to tell about it.
15	Erebos must have forgotten!\nTora deliver knife for Erebos!
16	We had better ask its owner about it,\nif the opportunity ever presents itself.
qst000802_ms.json
1	Heya! Looks like fate brought us\ntogether, eh? Hear me out, will you?
2	The name's Erebos!
3	I'm a treasure hunter. Ever since my\ngrandpa, my family's been traveling\nAlrest for fame and fortune!
4	Erebos? The same Erebos that was\nwritten on that knife? We've been\nlooking for you!
5	Erebos? The same Erebos that was\nwritten on that knife? We've been\nlooking for you!
6	Erebos? The same Erebos that was\nwritten on that knife? We've been\nafter you!
7	Erebos? Same Erebos that was\nwritten on broken knife?!\nTora find you at last!
8	Erebos? The same Erebos that was\nwritten on that knife? It seems we\nfinally meet.
9	Erebos? The same Erebos that was\nwritten on that knife? I've been lookin'\nfor ya!
10	You were looking for me?!
11	Wait, this knife...\nCan it be...?!
12	You're going to slit my throat with it...
13	and then take my findings and my\ngrandpa's treasure for yourself,\naren't you!
14	Well, I'm not falling for your tricks!\nGood thing the old man taught me to\ntake everything with a pinch of salt!
qst000803_ms.json
1	Urgh... So this is it, huh?
2	But I swear, you won't be laying one\nfoot near my grandpa's treasure. Even\nif it costs me my life...
3	...What? All you did was find a knife\nwith my name on it? That's it?
4	No, I'm the one who should be\nsorry here. I guess I went and\njumped to the wrong conclusion.
5	It's a tough life, hunting solo. Makes\nyou get in the habit of blurting out\nyour life story to total strangers.
6	And sometimes you get bad sorts.\nThe kind that'll kill for treasure.
7	Thanks for the concern. But don't\nworry.
8	My grandpa warned me that the life of\na treasure hunter is like walking on a\ntightrope. You've gotta be prepared.
9	Now where were we...?\nOh yeah, you brought me this knife.
10	This was a present from my grandpa.\nI wanted to open the second chest with\nit, and managed to break it real good.
11	"Wealth and fortune," it said on it.\nBut a broken lucky charm isn't going\nto bring anything but bad luck.
12	So I gave up on the treasure and\nparted with the knife there.
13	But now your merry band of Drivers\nhave brought it back to me. Funny,\nisn't it?
14	I guess this must be the workings\nof some higher power.
15	I mean, you bested me in a fight.\nMy grandpa would kill me himself\nif it turned out you were weaklings!
16	Anyhow, I'll be off. Got some\njourneying ahead before I reach\nmy next destination.
17	Time to get my hands on some\nancient Nopon relics!
18	You'd better not be thinking about\ngetting to 'em before me, you hear?

qst000901_ms.json
1	Ah!\nThese Ignas are tough...
2	I don't think we can take much more...
3	Who...are you?
4	Never mind!\nWe need your help!
qst000902_ms.json
1	Thanks a lot.\nYou really saved our hides there.
2	I suppose I should introduce myself!
3	I am Ragi!\nI'm in charge of this sorry bunch of\nmercenaries!
4	As you can see, we're still kind of small\ntime. It's early days for us.
5	But someday, our names are going to\nring out all over Uraya.
6	So, we'll take on pretty much any kind\nof job right now, just to get a bit of...\nOh, crap!
7	Ah, it's just...we were meant to be\nbodyguarding for a Nopon trader\ncalled Dororo. But...
8	Those Ignas... They attacked us and\nmade off with our client!
9	Ah...it's pretty embarrassing for a\nbodyguard, letting the employer get\ncaptured...
10	Bah...I'd love to get out there and give\nthose Ignas what for...
11	We'd need to tune up our gear\nfirst though...and make a plan.
12	I'm not sure that we have time for that\nthough. Dororo'll be lizard-lunch by the\ntime we get set up.
13	Really?! You'll help?
14	Yeah, you're right.
15	That furry little dude's life is on the\nline. I just gotta swallow my pride here.
16	I'll leave it to you guys.
17	Those Igna bastards took Dororo back\nto their lair.
18	The lair...? It's past Minnet\nTerrace, in Badfella's Cave Fort.
19	If you go now you should catch 'em up.\nGo! Save Dororo!
20	The Ignas' lair is in Badfella's Cave\nFort!
21	It's past Minnet Terrace, then\nstraight on. You've still got time to\ncatch 'em!
22	Please promise me you'll help that\nlittle Nopon fella out.
qst000903_ms.json
1	Hey! Dororo not lizard food! Honestly,\nnot even taste good!
2	Let Dororo go!
3	Mehmeh?
4	Did friends come to help poor little\nDororo out perhaps? Please say yes.
5	Mehmeh!\nThanks from bottom of Dororo's heart!
6	Now bash up nasty Ignas!
qst000904_ms.json
1	Meh! Friends saved Dororo!
2	If it wasn't for friends, Dororo probably\nbaked into disgusting Igna pie by now.
3	Meh... Thinking of sloshing around in\nhorrible cuisine make Dororo feel bit\nsick...
4	Thanks to friends for saving Dororo\nfrom that horrible fate.
5	But nasty Ignas make off with Dororo's\ncargo of 500 Ruby Mangosteens...
6	But no, Dororo should not complain.\nImportant thing is being alive!
7	As long as Dororo alive, can always\nstart over and find new merchandise!
8	Is partly fault of Dororo anyway.\nAlways risky to hire rookie mercenaries.\nWas just unlucky this time.
9	But sometimes difficulties in life\nnecessary for personal growth!
10	Is job of merchants like Dororo to\nprovide up-and-coming mercenaries\nwith opportunity to grow!
11	If Dororo give Ragi's band a bit more\nreal-life experience, they surely grow\ninto fine fighting force.
12	And then they provide Dororo quality\nservices at bargain rate! Is win-win!
13	Mehmeh! Dororo predict bright future\nfor business!
14	OK! Friends take Dororo back to Ragi?
15	Dororo not likely to survive another\nbashing from Ignas, so grateful to be\nescorted.
qst000905_ms.json
1	Thank you so much!\nGood to see this little fella back in one\npiece.
2	It's been a real lesson, this. We know\nhow much we need to improve now.
3	It's sad to say, but we really bit off\nmore than we could chew.
4	If we can't even handle a few Ignas,\nit's going to be a long time before\nour names ring out in Uraya...
5	But there was one good thing\nthat came from all this!
6	Dororo says he's going to invest\nin our mercenary band!
7	We'll do everything we can to make\nsure his money doesn't go to waste!
8	Which reminds me - we want\nyou to have this.
9	It's our fee from Dororo for\nthis job. You guys are the ones\nthat really earned it.
10	We'd be honored if you'd accept it.
11	Nah, we're the ones that should be\nsaying thank you.
12	This whole mess taught us exactly how\nstrong we need to get. As strong as you\nguys!
qst001001_ms.json
1	I can't leave my post, but I've\ngot to do something...
2	Ahh, well, the thing is, we've got\nourselves a little problem here.
3	The kids went out to play, but it's been\nages and they haven't come back.
4	When they go out to play, sometimes\nthey come back with stuff we need,\nlike food or raw materials.
5	It's all well and good but I worry. I've\nasked them to stop, but you know kids.
6	They just want to help the village\nin their own way, I suppose.\nPlaying at mercs.
7	At any rate, it's not unusual\nfor them to be late back, but...
8	Whichever way you slice it, they've\nbeen gone an awfully long time.
9	I don't want to overly worry,\nbut you do hear stories...
10	I want to go make sure they're OK,\nbut I can't abandon my duties.
11	You'll go and check for me?\nThanks, that would be a huge help!
12	The kids said they were heading over\nGreatmaw Rapids way.
13	I'd start looking there.\nThanks a lot!
14	The kids are probably over by\nthe Greatmaw Rapids.
15	I really hope nothing's happened...
qst001002_ms.json
1	The kids are in trouble!\nLet's go!
2	The kids are in trouble!\nLet's go!

1	Y...yes...\nWe're all fine, thanks to you!
2	Drivers are SO COOL!
3	When I grow up I wanna be just like...
4	Ah, I wasn't saying nothing!\nJust talking to myself!
5	We gotta get back to the village.\nMr. Geross'll be worried.
qst001004_ms.json
1	Thanks for saving us!
2	It was so cool when you fought those\nmonsters! Swish! Bash! Smash!
3	I can totally see why Jelved\nlooks up to Drivers so much.
qst001005_ms.json
1	Thank goodness everyone was OK.\nI'm so relieved.
2	Next time we'll make sure they're\naccompanied by an adult.
3	We should let Yew know.\nThanks for helping, guys.
4	Oh, I nearly forgot!\nPlease take this.
5	It's nothing special. Just a little\nsomething to say thanks.
6	Don't mention it!\nYou really helped us out!
qst001006_ms.json
1	Hey! Hey!
2	I wanna ask a favor!
3	Lemme be your apprentice!
4	My folks were Drivers back in Gormott.
5	But they got betrayed by one of their\nmates and died...
6	Me and my sis got taken\nin by Vandham.
7	We're real grateful to him and all the\nmercs here...but sometimes my sis\ngets a bit sad all the same.
8	She always says she wants to\neat a whole Grass-Smoked Salmon\nlike mum used to make.
9	Whenever I hear her say that,\nI get all angry in my belly.
10	I'll get revenge one day!
11	To kind of pay back the villagers,\nI've been gathering the kids to\ncollect food and stuff for them.
12	But I'm never gonna get strong enough\nto avenge my parents like this.
13	I wanna resonate with the Core Crystal\nmy dad left me as soon as I can.
14	That's why you gotta train me!\nI wanna be the best Driver there is!
15	What should we say?
16	Dissuade him from taking revenge
17	Let him tread his own path
18	I shoulda known.
19	Adults are all the same.\nI thought you'd understand!
20	I agree.
21	Playing at mercs is good\nenough for that kid.
22	None of this becoming a Driver\nso he can go and kill people.
23	I'm sure he feels frustrated right now,\nbut someday he'll understand.
24	Revenge doesn't solve anything.\nIt just creates a vicious circle.
25	Anyway, thanks for saving the kids.
26	We'll keep a better eye\non them in future.
27	I'm doing the right thing?
28	Can you gimme any advice?\nStuff I should learn, training\ndrills I should be doing?
29	Hey, Jelved, don't bother\nthe nice people.
30	But but but...
31	Your little merc games are\nplenty good enough for now.
32	Nobody is born a Driver.
33	You got plenty of time, kid.
34	OK.\nI get it.
35	I won't do anything from now on\nexcept look for food and stuff and\nhelp everyone in the village.
36	That experience'll be useful\nin the future, right?
37	Thanks for talking to me!
38	I'm definitely gonna be\na Driver someday!
qst001007_ms.json
1	Thanks.
2	You helped everyone get back safe.
3	I heard Geross wants to thank you.\nYou should talk to him.
qst001008_ms.json
1	I got told off for worrying Mr. Geross.
2	Gotta be more careful next time.
3	But if Jelved was a Driver,\nnobody'd have to worry...

2	...then this bit'll go like this...
3	Yeah! That's the one!\nI'm a genius!
4	Huh? Who are you lot?
5	Oh, is that right. Figures why I\nwouldn't recognize you, then.
6	They call me Chulev.
7	I'm really into smithing. I leave all that\nbuying, selling, wheeling and dealing to\nthe youngsters.
8	If there's something you want me to\nknock up for you, just let me know.\nAlways looking for new ideas.
9	Oh, but what am I doing?!
10	I almost clean forgot about the\nbrilliant idea I just had!
11	Well, the thing is... I just came up\nwith an idea for a new accessory.
12	When it's complete, it'll be the first of\nits kind!
13	But I'm, uh, a bit short on some\nof the things I need for it.
14	Maybe you could go gather 'em up for\nme? 'Course, I'll let you have one, after\nI've made it.
15	I'm not in this for the profit anyhow.\nI just really love making things.\nSo, how's about it?
16	Oh! You'll help me out, will ya? Thanks!\nGood to see there's still a few\nenterprising youngsters out there!
17	So what I need is a Pione Stone\nand some Gorilla Hair Bristle.
18	Pione Stone's easy enough to find.\nUraya's a pretty rocky place.
19	Gorilla Hair Bristleは××で\n●●を倒せば採れるかもしれんの
20	Thanks for dealing with that.
21	You'll find Pione Stones in\nrocky areas of Uraya.
22	Gorilla Hair Bristleは××で\n●●を倒せば採れるかもしれんの
23	I'll wait here for as long as it takes you.\nWell, or till I die. Nobody lives forever!

qst001102_ms.json
1	Hmm, and who might you be?
2	Whazzat? You brought some materials?\nI asked you for them, did I?
3	Well, I'll be. I quite appreciate it.\nWhen you get to my age, the past stops\nseeming so important, you understand.
4	Anyhow, let's see what we have here.\nA Pione Stone and some Gorilla Hair\nBristle... Interesting.
5	Can't remember exactly what I had in\nmind now... But I'm sure it was good.\nI'll just knock something up with this.
6	Hmmm...
7	Ooh, I've got it! Yeah! This is going to\nbe even better than the thing I was\nthinking of before! ...Whatever it was...
8	Yep, if I just put these together with\na couple other materials, we'll have\nourselves a real winner on our hands!
9	○○○○する\nアクセサリーじゃ！

14	Yeah, you're pretty excited, huh?\nWell, I'll look forward to getting the\nstuff!
qst001103_ms.json
1	Brought the stuff, did you? I'll get the\nfinishing touches done lickety-split!
2	Hmmm...
3	Now, let me think. What was it\nI was going to make again...?
4	Yeah, hmm...\nI feel like I sort of remember...\nBut then again, I sort of don't...
5	You remember, don't you?
6	What was Chulev trying to make?
7	体力があがるアクセサリーの名称を入れる（仮）
8	素早くなるアクセサリーの名称を入れる（仮）
9	Ah! Of course.\nYes, I remember perfectly now.
10	OK! I'm good to go! Leave it to me!
11	Hmmm... Was that really it...?
12	Now that you say it, it does\nsort of ring a bell...?
13	Ah, whatever.\nYou just leave it to me.
14	Done and dusted! That's my\nmasterpiece, that is!
15	It was all thanks to you lot that\nI managed to get this made!
16	Well, you should have this, as a token\nof thanks.
17	Nah, no need to thank me. I haven't\nhad this much fun putting something\ntogether since...well, I can't remember...
18	Hey, when we first met, didn't you say\nthat you'd make any accessory we\nasked for?
19	By the way...when we first met, didn't\nyou say you'd make any accessory\nwe named, hmm?
20	Oh, yes! When we first meet,\ndid friend not offer to making\nwhatever accessories we like?
21	By the by, didn't you offer to make us\nmore accessories when we first met?\nI seem to remember you saying that.
22	Hey, by the way, you said before\nyou'd be able to knock up any wacky\naccessory we dreamed up, didn't you?
23	Erm... Did I? I dunno. Maybe I did.\nI can't remember.
24	But, one thing's for sure! I'm going to\nkeep making whatever takes my fancy!
qst001201_ms.json
1	You! Hey! You!
2	You over there! You've inspired\nme deeply! In a way I can scarcely\ndescribe!
3	Ah! What a dashing profile! I'd love to\ntry and capture it with a sketch or two!
4	But as much as I'd love to immortalize\nyou in art... I actually have another,\nmore pressing request.
5	I was working on some landscapes,\nI got a bit carried away, and before\nI knew, it, I was out of paint!
6	I can only use special paints of the\nhighest quality. Actually, I concoct\nthem myself.
7	You need the right ingredients for really\nvivid color. It's the foundation that my\nvery work is based upon.
8	I asked my mercenary buddy to try and\nfind some...
9	But I couldn't afford the fee. This\nconflict with Mor Ardain has really\nmade things expensive.
10	Too expensive for an impoverished\nartist like myself, anyhow.
11	But just when I thought things were\nhopeless, you appeared before me!
12	Yes! I would call it fate! Destiny is\nlike the artwork of the gods!
13	If I may, I would like to ask you to find\nfor me the ingredients that constitute\nmy paints.
14	I'm afraid I cannot offer cash. But I\nwill surely find you something valuable\nin return for your services.
15	Does my offer please you?\nWill you accept?
16	Many thanks!
17	What I require is some Crustip\nChitin and Tricolor Rock.
18	I dare say Crustip Chitin can be had by\nfelling a Krim Crustip at Farlaine Wells.
19	Tricolor Rock can be found in rocky\nparts of Uraya.
20	A thousand thanks!
21	Oh, would that I had my paints already.\nThen I could sell some paintings and\nbuy some food...
22	Oh! You need to hear about the\ningredients for the paint again?
23	I dare say Crustip Chitin can be had by\nfelling a Krim Crustip at Farlaine Wells.
24	Tricolor Rock can be found in rocky\nparts of Uraya.
25	Ah! This is exactly what I require!\nMagnificent!
26	You have assisted me greatly.\nWith this, I can complete my work!
27	What should we ask?
28	Ask what she'll do when it's complete
29	Ask her what the hurry is
30	I'm hoping to sell my wares to a noble\nnamed Ysolde.
31	Ysolde has a special love for\nlandscapes, and the one I'm working on\nnow will be irresistible to her.
32	If she buys it, then I won't have to keep\nskipping lunch for want of coin.
33	It's because I'm starving, clearly!
34	If I don't complete it, then naturally,\nI won't be able to sell it. In which\neventuality, I can't buy food.
35	But, thanks to you, I should be able to\nfinish it.
36	I'm sure it'll fetch a handsome price.\nI won't have to worry about where my\nnext meal is coming from for a while.
37	Ah... I haven't given your reward yet...
38	Here. I'm sure this'll come in handy\none day.
39	No, no, thank you. Do come back! I\nhope you'll let me paint you sometime!
qst001301_ms.json
1	*sigh*\nWhat am I gonna do about this...?
2	Oh, hello there. That's about as big of\na welcome as I can muster right now.
3	I'm in a bit of tight spot. At this rate,\nmy whole trade might be done for!
4	But I dunno how interested you are in\nmy problems.
5	Huh? No, really, it'd bore you to death.\nWait, hang on...are you lot Drivers?
6	Oh, this is a turn-up for the books!
7	They've been having a bit of problem\nwith monsters in Gwenith Paddies\nlately. They can't harvest the Gromrice.
8	詳しくは知らねぇが\nヴィルトシュヴァイン傭兵団とやらが\nそのモンスター（仮）の天敵を倒しすぎたとか[ML:Dash ]
9	But anyhow, that means I can't make\nhalf the items on my menu, 'cos I've\ngot no Gromrice.
10	So my business is in a bit of a slump.\nI can't really open up till it gets sorted\nout.
11	It's not just a problem for me. I can't\npay my staff. I dunno what they're\ngoing to do.
12	Well, that's my problem. You lot look\npretty tough, so I thought it was worth\na punt to tell you about it.
13	Do you reckon you could get it sorted\nfor us?
14	Gwenith Paddiesの\nモンスター共（仮）を倒してほしいんだ
15	I'll make it worth your while, of course.
16	So, what do you say?
17	Oh, thank you so much! I really owe\nyou! Or, I mean, I will, once you've\ntaken care of it.
18	All right, well, I'll let you go and sort it\nout.
19	Hey there again. Did you\nforget where to go?
20	俺の依頼は\nGwenith Paddiesで繁殖した\nエネミー（仮）の討伐だ
21	Thanks for taking it on!
22	What's up? Did you forget something?
23	それとも　もうモンスター共（仮）を\n倒してきたのか？
24	Haha! Taking care of that many\nmonsters in such a short time? The\nvery thought of it!
25	Huh? Done already? No.\nI don't believe it. Seriously?
26	Are you sure you aren't fibbing?\nI'll find out if you are, y'know!\nBut wait... If you ARE serious...
27	Well, I told you I shut up shop\nfor the moment, yeah?
28	So, as the guy in charge, I gotta make\nsure we don't lose too much cash here.\nAnd wages cost a bunch.
29	So I kind of...don't have any staff left!
30	I guess I got a bit carried away letting\npeople go. But I mean, I didn't expect\nthe problem to clear up so quick!
31	Been in our family for generations,\nthis place has. I have to make tough\ndecisions to keep it afloat sometimes.
32	Seems like my decision backfired a bit\nthis time, though.
33	But it's far too soon to give up!
34	Could you help me out here while I\ntry and round some staff back up?
35	Hey, you've helped me this far.\nWhat's a little more, right?\nI'll double your reward and everything!
36	You'll help? Thanks a million!
37	OK, sorry to be throwin' orders at you\nalready, but there's this tricky request\njust came in from one of my regulars.
38	I need someone to fetch the\ningredients. Giant Frog Meat\nand Fusty Fungus, to be precise.
39	Fusty Fungus isn't too difficult.\nI just order it in from Garfont usually.
40	Giant Frog Meat, though...that's\na bit more tricky.
41	○○○にいる×××を倒せば\n手に入るだろう
42	It's a bit of big ask, but I'm sure you\nlot'll be able to sort it out, no problem.
43	Oh? You'll do it? That's a really big\nhelp to me!
44	OK, I'll leave it up to you lot then.\nGood luck!
45	It's not easy, getting staff to come\nback after you've let them go...
46	How you doing with that\nGiant Frog Meat and Fusty Fungus?
47	Fusty Fungus is pretty easy to order\nfrom Garfont.
48	Giant Frog Meatは\n○○○にいる×××を倒せば\n手に入るだろ
49	Good luck with it!
50	Aha! Just who I was hoping to see!
51	Right, I'll get this dish whipped up\nin a jiffy. Could you deliver it when\nit's done?
52	There you go! One Salted Brog Sauté!
53	Ever had it before? The eyes are the\ntastiest bit, y'know.
54	What's up? Hungry for something?
55	Course you are! Must be tough making\ndeliveries now all this lovely food's got\nyour taste buds tickled, eh?
56	I'll whip you up an extra bit if you like,\nsince you've already been so helpful.
57	Hey, what's up? Your appetite left you\nspeechless? Don't you want to try this\ndelicious grub?
58	Looks pretty tasty, doesn't it?
59	The smell's irresistible, isn't it?\nMelt in your mouth, that will.\nI bet you're dying for a bite, right?
60	How will you respond?
61	Say you'd like to try it sometime
62	Say you never want to eat it
63	Ah! I knew it! Well, I wouldn't dream of\nnot giving you a taste of this gourmet\ncuisine.
64	Hehehe... I'll stew yours in the oily\njuices a little longer to make sure\nit's packed full of froggy flavor!
65	Uh... All right, then?
66	That's mighty odd... Who wouldn't\nlove my famous Salted Brog Sauté?
67	I was going to give you a year's supply\nas your payment, actually. Maybe I'd\nbest come up with a different reward.
68	Anyway, let's focus on the task at hand.
69	Can you deliver this to Svandin for me?
70	You'll find him at the Urayan barracks\nnear Fonsa Myma Port.
71	Thanks again!
72	Huh? Not too sure where you're\nsupposed to go, are you?
73	You'll find Svandin at the Urayan\nbarracks near Fonsa Myma Port.
74	Thanks a lot for taking care\nof that for me.
75	Good to see you again! Looks like you\nmanaged to take care of that delivery.\nThat's a real big help!
76	Thanks to you lot, I'm going to be able\nto get my business back on its feet!
77	Now as for your compensation...
78	I'd like to give you one of our\nsuper-secret recipes.
79	Salted Brog Sauté! What did you\nthink it was going to be?
80	I was in deep trouble there, and you\nhelped me out. So I wanted to give you\nsomething really special.
81	It's my great grandpa's recipe, but I'm\nsure he wouldn't mind me giving it to\nyou, considering the circumstances.
82	Hey, you're looking a bit green round\nthe gills. Are you feeling OK?
83	Haven't been working yourself sick,\nhave you?
84	Nothing a nice big bowl of Salted Brog\nSauté won't fix!
qst001302_ms.json
1	Ooh... That smell...
2	That could only be Eurion's cooking!
3	Ah, thanks for delivering that... Salted\nBrog Sauté is kind of my life-blood.
4	I heard they had some problems with\nthe supply of Gromrice. But it looks like\nit's all sorted out now!
5	Huh? Just warning you, I'm not gonna\nshare this. It's one of the only things\nmakes my life worth living here.
6	Why don't you run off back to Eurion\nand convey my thanks.
7	Don't bother me when I'm\ngetting ready to enjoy a delicious\nSalted Brog Sauté!
8	Just give my thanks to Eurion, OK?

18	んじゃ　俺は行かせてもらうぜ\nあばよ！
19	Well met, fellows!\nAnd have I got news for you!
20	So the Imperial Army recently caught\na spy. A spy who'd stolen some\ntop-secret intelligence.
21	Question time! Where do you think\nthey hid it?
22	Where do we think it's hidden?
23	Buried in the ground
24	Inside their stomach
25	In the Cloud Sea
26	Nuh-uh.
27	Though it might have been better\nin the long run...
28	Made it so that only a salvager could\nget to it?
29	Interesting, but no.
30	The spy, without the time to hide the\ndocuments properly, put them in a\nsteel box and fed them to a monster.
31	Now that's food for thought!
32	An excellent guess!
33	Oh, but not inside their own stomach.\nA monster's stomach.
34	Put the documents in a steel box,\nthen, gulp!
35	And that monster was a, drumroll,\nNoog Skeeter!
36	Only thing is, you know how freely\nthose monsters fly across the\nArdainian skies...
37	The Noog Skeeter that swallowed the\ndocuments got mixed in with the flock\nand now we don't know which one it is!
38	There's a pretty big prize riding on it,\nbut taking down even one is a process...\nCost, benefit, y'know?
39	Anyhoo, that's the story. A request of\nbig effort, no takers.
40	Eh, if you feel like doing it, I'm not\ngonna stop you.
41	Defeat the Noog Skeeters and\nrecover the documents...
42	then hand them over to the soldier\nat the Hardhaigh Palace gatehouse\nto get your reward.
43	Oh, yeah...
44	You might be able to tell which\nNoog Skeeter swallowed\nthe documents.
45	With that thing in its stomach, it might\nbe feeling a wee bit crabbit.
46	Ah, but you might have to be watching\nfor a pretty long time...
47	Hey-oh, you still doing that job\nI told you about before?
48	Defeat the Noog Skeeters and\nrecover the documents...
49	then hand them over to the soldier\nin the Hardhaigh Palace gatehouse\nto get your reward.
50	Best of luck!

12	Hello, citizen. Something the matter?
13	T-this!\nWhere did you-?!
14	...Ooohh, I see.\nYou went to all that trouble.
15	I shudder to think what might happen\nif this information got into the other\ncountries' hands...
16	If Emperor Niall and Special Inquisitor\nMòrag's past schedules became public\nknowledge, they'd be in deep water!
17	Oop, pardon, I overstepped.\nYou heard nothing.
18	You've been a great help, really\nyou have. Thank you very much.
19	This is your reward. Take it, please.
20	Special Inquisitor Mòrag!\nIs something the matter?
21	There was a case, wasn't there, of a\nspy hiding top-secret intelligence inside\na Noog Skeeter?!
22	I have retrieved it.
23	...Wow!\nLady Mòrag Flamebringer herself\ndid us the honor of recovering it?!
24	And to think that Emperor Niall and\nLady Mòrag's childhood diaries could\nhave been halfway to Uraya by now...
25	...
26	I beg your pardon!\nA slip of the tongue, is all!
27	Regardless, this is a great help.\nThank you very much!
28	Don't mention it.\nAll in a day's work.

5	Ah, what a bind...
6	It's a great idea, but I don't know if\nthere's anyone out there who can\nmake it happen...
7	Know anything about Dolphin Carrot\nSliders?
8	They're selling them over at Griogair's\nGreens... But it was my idea!
9	Cheers!
10	Thing is, I've got a few ideas for a new\nmenu. But I can't make a test batch\nuntil I get the ingredients.
11	As you can see, Mor Ardain's not\nthe most fertile of lands. Often the\ningredients simply aren't available.
12	Well, I guess you are Drivers.\nAnd travelling all over Alrest, no less.\nMaybe you would be able to help!
13	I'd really owe you one if you get it\nsorted.

3	Oh, you got your hands on them,\ndid you? Took your time too...
4	Well, I'd better get to it and whip up\nthis new menu!
5	I hope you'll stick around till it's done.\nI need a guinea pig!
6	これが新作料理名（仮）だ！
7	OK! Have a gobful of that!
8	Yeah... That's working taste buds you\ndidn't even know you had, right?\n5,000G a serving, and it's worth it!
9	You can't hunt an ENEMY1 and\nENEMY2 and expect to sell for\nanything less.
10	Thing is...no one round here's got that\nsort of money.
11	Huh? You think there's a few\nhigh-rollers living round here?
12	Most of the folks that live round these\nparts work at the hot springs or around\nthe Great Heat Extraction Duct.
13	Nah, none of those lot can afford\n5,000G just for a wee bit of scran.\nI need to offer something a bit cheaper.
14	Tch, I've messed up again. How could\nI not think of that...
15	Ah, it's a bit cheeky...but could you\ntake care of another request for me?
16	Do you reckon you could track down\nsome Puri Leaf Cabbage and some\nCrunchy Passion Fruit?
17	It won't be anywhere near as classy,\nbut I'll still be able to stir up a solid\nbit of grub.
18	For the Puri Leaf Cabbage, you'll want\nsome that's produced in Argentum.
19	You can get some decent Crunchy\nPassion Fruits in Mor Ardain though.
20	With those two things, my menu should\nbe ready to go!
qst001603_ms.json
1	Thanks a million. I may have gone\na little overboard with the requests...
2	Well, I'd better get to work on the new\nmenu.
3	You get first bite again. So stick around!
4	これが新作料理名（仮）だ！
5	Get a load of that!
6	Yup. None too shabby, is it?
7	The new menu's complete now. Thanks\nto your help!
8	I'd better give you your reward.
9	Ah, money's not really enough for all\nthat you've done for me! So, I've\nthought up a new recipe, just for you.
10	I call them Addam's Supercakes!
11	Price notwithstanding, I'd say it's the\ntastiest morsel you'll get in the whole\nof Mor Ardain!
12	Maybe if there's a budding chef\namongst you, you can have them\nwhip it up!
13	Honestly, the taste is to die for.
14	No, no! All the thanks should be going\nin your direction! Well, see you around!

2	Place: Thermal Exhaust Fork\nTask: Culling of Noog Vangs and\nrecovery of 3 Whitescale Antennae.
3	Please report to Joblin at Hardhaigh\nPalace on completion.
qst001702_ms.json
1	Oh, I'm rushed off my feet here!
2	I went to the trouble of putting a flyer\nup at Nharil Central Plaza, but did\nanyone bother to read it, I wonder?
3	Ugh, not that I have time to be fretting\nabout things like that...
4	I'd better get my report written up.\nIt might impact on the budget for the\nnext quarter.
5	Oh! These are Whitescale Antennae,\nare they not?
6	And exactly three, no less! Excellent!\nPerhaps you saw the flyer?
7	Ah, I see. Well, it's a big help.
8	I'm engaged in research of Ardainian\nfauna, you see.
9	Naturally, that requires a certain\namount of hands-on work in the\nrelevant locations.
10	But sadly, I don't really have the time,\nor required martial abilities, to visit the\nThermal Exhaust Fork.
11	My hands are full with researching a\nrange of lifeforms. Unfortunately, the\nhumble Noog Vang has a lower priority.
12	However, if you have the Whitescale\nAntennae from the Noog Vang, then it's\nenough for a basic report.
13	If the information contained in my\nreport is disseminated throughout the\nmilitary...
14	then no doubt it'll make the job of\ntaking on those wretched Noog\nVangs quite a bit easier.
15	Well, I should get to work on my\nreport.
16	Oh, and here is your reward. I'm very\nglad that you responded to my request,\nso thanks again!
qst001801_ms.json
1	Oh goodness, thank you.\nYou really saved me!
2	My name is Olua. You can probably\ntell I'm a Blade. Nice to meet you!
3	What should we say to her?

5	Ask what happened to her Driver
6	I'm awfully sorry.
7	I'm in your debt, but I\ncan't join you.
8	I have a wonderful Driver named Reid.
9	Ah, you noticed.
10	My Driver is a wonderful\nyoung man named Reid.
11	He is still a novice Driver,\nnot yet as strong as you.
12	Nor is he much of a\nswordsman yet.
13	So when faced with danger, he\ntends to run away.
14	But a Moks Eluca caught him unawares\nfrom behind, and sent him tumbling\ndown into the Cloud Sea.
15	Don't worry.\nEverything's fine!
16	I'm still alive so he must be too.
17	...I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried.
18	Do you think you'd be able to\nperhaps look for Reid?
19	He might be fine right now,\nbut if he got attacked by a monster\nhe'd be a sitting duck.
20	Thank you.
21	There's a chance that Reid may\nreturn under his own steam, so\nI'll wait here in case he does.
22	Reid fell into the Cloud Sea, so\nI'd start looking under this island.
23	I pray he managed to reach\none of the islands...
24	Of course he's all right.\nReid is a strong Ardainian boy.\nGood luck on your search!
25	Help me!
26	Defeat those Moks Elucas! Please!

10	But I hav'nae got any stronger,\nnot a bit. And Olua doesn't trust\nme at all.
11	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]I don't wanna be a Driver any more!
12	We should say something to him.
13	Ask him if he can get back on his own
14	Tell him it's fine to be weak at his age
15	[ML:Feeling ]...Uh...
16	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Of course not!
17	Ugh!\nI guess I've gotta go back to Olua.
18	UGHHH she's the WORST\nBLADE EVER. I've got to give\nher a piece of my mind!!
19	[ML:Feeling ]I know I'm just a kid.
20	But...
21	I wonder if I could get as strong\nas youse if I tried really hard?
22	OK.
23	I'll go back to Olua FOR NOW.\nAnd I'll tell her not to be so annoying!
qst001803_ms.json
1	Reid...\nI'm so glad you're all right!
2	Sorry for worryin' you.
3	Indeed. If you trained up and\ngot a little stronger, I wouldn't\nhave to worry so much.
4	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]No! You've got to stop with that, Olua!
5	[ML:Feeling ]Didn't this just prove it?
6	I'm no Driver! Not yet!
7	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]I've got to get strong like these\nguys before I can go off on\njourneys and stuff!
8	[ML:Feeling ]But the training trips are how\nyou become strong, Reid.
9	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Aye, there's a limit!
10	Let's travel AFTER I've learned how\nto swordfight and what have you!
11	You've got it all backwards!
12	[ML:Feeling ]It's like you're askin' me to make a\nbanquet when I can't even hold a knife.
13	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]If you just put your mind to it, though...
14	Everyone's got to start somewhere!\nThe most important thing is taking\nthe first step!
15	[ML:Feeling ]Ah...
16	Let's talk about this later. We should\nbe thankful to these fine people.
17	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]I don't care, whatever!
18	I'm goin' home!\nYou can do your trainin' mission alone!
19	[ML:Feeling ]Young man!
20	Here's something by way of thanks.\nI hope we meet again sometime\nand we can talk properly.
21	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Here's hoping they sort it out\neventually...

1	Do you know the shop called\nLlysiau Greens?
2	There's a girl who works there, Tenne.\nShe's such a bright and cheerful lass,\nbut last month she lost her father...
3	Her mother's succumbed to illness a\nwhile ago, it was just the two of them.\nI feel so bad for her now, all alone...
4	She's got the brains to put out new\nproducts, no problem, but running a\nshop by herself must be hard.
5	As you can probably tell, I'm worried\nabout her, so...I'd like you to save\nher business!
6	First of all, buy one piece of\nevery product that's on offer.
7	That'll let Tenne know you mean well.
8	What that means is, she'll let you buy\nthe deeds to Llysiau Greens.
9	When you do that, you'll become the\nshop's owner. With me so far?
10	Well, when I say owner, I don't mean\nlike sharing in the profits, but relax!\nThere's plenty of benefits to it still.
11	Tenne will be relieved to know that\nsomeone like you has her back, and\nshe'll be able to get on with things...
12	And you'll get special boons too.\nFor example, things like making\nharvesting easier, or running faster.
13	How about it?\nCan I count on you?
14	That's the right answer!
15	Like I said before, then.\nFirst, buy the whole selection\nof goods at Tenne's shop.
16	Including the new Puri Leaf Salad,\nof course! Well, off you go!
17	First you buy every product that\nis sold at Llysiau Greens.
18	That means the Crispy Sauté and the\nTorigoth Marinade... And then...
19	The Stuffed Meaty Carrot and that\nPuri Leaf Salad they've just introduced.
20	It's fine to buy just one of each.\nGot that?
21	Now you should be able to buy the\nLlysiau Deeds over at Llysiau Greens,\nam I right?
22	I know, I know, it's not cheap.\nNevertheless, I'd like you to buy it next.
23	Please. You know I'm counting on you!
24	Thank you.
25	It feels really great to see Tenne\nsmiling again.
26	She's always been cheerful and kind,\nbut also kind of stubborn...
27	I know she doesn't need her old friends\nlike me looking over her shoulder.\nShe can stand on her own feet.
28	I know this, but still... I can't help being\na little worried, can I? I just wanted to\ngive her a hand, just a bit.
29	With your help, I think she'll have found\nthe confidence she needs for the shop\nshe inherited to thrive.
30	Oh, and also, you know it's not just\nTenne's shop, right? Other businesses\nwork much the same way.
31	Buy every item they have, and\nthey'll start offering to sell you\ntheir deeds.
32	Buy that and you'll get a nice fat\nadvantage. Different ones, depending\non the shop.
33	Ah, one word of warning though.
34	It's not every shop that'll offer all\ntheir products from the get-go.\nFew do, in fact.
35	In those cases, you'll have to raise the\ndevelopment level before they'll sell\neverything, letting you get the deeds.
36	And sometimes, if they don't seem to\noffer the deeds no matter what, it's\nworth trying again in a little bit.
37	Oh, haha, sorry to keep you so long!\nI can stop being such a busybody now.
38	You have my gratitude.\nThanks, for everything!

13	Sokoko have to ditch boat in Cloud Sea\nand cash in insurance money to pay\npenalty fee.
14	Thank you, friend!\nSokoko start to see little dot of\nlight at end of tunnel.
15	Salvaging contract of Sokoko like this...
16	Must get 14 Energy Aubergines and\n5 Border Sapphires from Leftherian\nArchipelago.
17	Then need to get hold of\n20 Angel Engines.
18	Ah... Not to worry, friend.
19	Already have 18 Angel Engines. Only\nneed two more.
20	Need lots of rare things... But friends\nnot give up, please!
qst001902_ms.json
1	Meh! Friend found all of items?

qst001903_ms.json
1	Hmm?\nWhat'd ya want?
2	Oh... The job I gave to Sokoko...
3	You managed to do it, did ya?\nNot bad going.
4	The little furball gave up?\nNot surprised.
5	I did my best to explain it.
6	It wasn't a job for your everyday\nsalvager. Needs a Blade, really.
7	But that little clump o' fluff wouldn't\nlisten to reason.
8	"Mushroom-Feast Salvager Sokoko\nsalvage anything, meh-meh-meh!"\n...The daft wee thing...
9	Gotta admire that can-do Nopon\nattitude though.
10	Well, I guess I'd better give you the\nreward.

4	Titan's elbows! What am I to do?
5	Oh, dear me... My dear old girl'll be\nspinning in her grave, she will!
6	Woe is me! Is there not a gallant\nyoungster somewhere who would help\nan old wretch such as me?
7	Oh! You look like the sort that could\nhelp! Strong of arm!
8	Could you spare a moment to help an\nold man in distress, in the twilight of\nhis years?
9	I was robbed... Robbed I tell you! Of\nsomething very precious, by a vile,\nslobbering beast of a monster!
10	I strolled up here, same as I do every\nmorning... Then something set upon me\nfrom the rear!
11	It all happened so fast... Couldn't even\nclap my eyes on what kind of monster\nit was. Or what direction it ran off in.
12	Oh, it was a dear thing to her. She had\nit with her right till the end, she did.\nAnd it's a dear keepsake to me, too.
13	I'd get it back myself... But these old\nbones aren't up to it. Maybe you young\nvaliants would be able to though?
14	Oh! You'll get it back for me, will you?\nKind and brave! Thank you!
15	Like I said before, I've no idea what\nmonster it was that took it.
16	Maybe you'll be able to find some\nsort of clue if you sniff around there\nyourselves.
17	Well, good luck with it!
18	I was right by the Village Guardian\nwhen I got assaulted. Have a bit of a\nlook there and you might get lucky.
19	I was by the steps when it came at me.\nI had a look round there meself, but I\ncouldn't see 'owt.
20	If you could return it to me, I'd be so\ngrateful...
21	Managed to find it, did you?
22	It's a precious memento of my old girl,\nthis is.
23	Yes, when she was alive, she always\nhad this round her neck.
24	Brings it all back, holding this. I can\nsmell her breath, like she was licking\nmy face after chewing on a bone.
25	Let's ask him...
26	Ask him if it was his wife's
27	Ask him if it was his dog's
28	Huh? What are you talking about?
29	This was my dog Sally's collar!
30	Why would my wife wear a dog collar?
31	Oh, the very thought of it!\nYou're a strange sort.
32	Huh?\nNow I come to think of it, I didn't make\nthat clear, did I?
33	My old dog Sally's collar, this was.
34	Ah, I remember the days when she was\nstill here, and she'd scamper round the\nmeadow...
35	Oh... I got a bit carried away\non the nostalgia train there...
36	You'll have to forgive me... When you\nget to this age, you can't help it.
37	Well, you've been a tremendous help\nto me. Have this for your troubles.

4	Ayup, Rex. You're a Driver now, are\nya, lad?
5	Yeah. I'm still keeping up with the\nsalvaging though.
6	Good job, because there was something\nI wanted to ask you about...
7	Ah, it's nowt major. I just thought I'd\nsee if a Driver could help.
8	Have you got a minute to hear me out?
9	This watering hole's not been giving\nout much water lately.
10	So we're a bit short of water.\nI can't have my bath, or get\nmy taters washed.
11	It's not the only water supply we've\ngot, but I'm worried the other sources\nmight go the same way...
12	エネミー名（仮）が原因なんだよ
13	I dunno if it's their mating season or\nsomething, but they've built a load of\nnests on the underside of the Titan.
14	It happened before, two years ago.\nIt's almost as bad as it was before.\nWe've let it build up, unfortunately.
15	We had to call in a Driver just to come\nand sort it out last time. Cost a fortune!
16	I heard you were round Corinne's\nhouse, so I thought I'd ask you and\nsee if you could take care of it.
17	Cheers for that.
18	これからエネミー（仮）用の\nシリンダを渡すよ
19	You should use one of them. You can\nsalvage some from Messet Point.
20	そうすれば\n巨神獣に巣くってるエネミー（仮）が\n引っかかるはずだ
21	There might be two or three of them.
22	Not a right lot, but mind you don't\nget hurt.
23	Messet Pointから\nエネミー（仮）用シリンダーを使って\nサルベージしてくれ
24	Thanks for that, lad! We've got water\ncoming out again now.
25	I can have me bath now, and get me\nspuds polished.
26	Aye, it's pretty handy having a local\nlad become a Driver.
27	You can take care of stuff that's\ndifficult for us lot in no time at all.
28	And you're still keeping your hand in\nwith the salvaging too.
29	I'm impressed, lad!
30	Well, here's the fee. I got everyone to\nchip in for it.
31	You've earned it, lad!

3	There's quite a few of them...\nI count eight...
4	But we'll have to take them all out!
qst002201_ms.json
1	Ahh! Wh-who are you?!
2	Oh, you're not one of the locals...\nThank goodness.
3	My name is Mellica.
4	My mother was orphaned in the war,\nand she raised me here in Indol.
5	So although I'm Gormotti, I've\nnever actually been to Gormott...
6	Lately there's something that's been\nbothering me... I feel like someone's\nspying on me all the time.
7	I was accepted into the Choir of Indol\njust recently, and I think that's when\nit started...
8	Well, it's driving me a little crazy...
9	If you would be so kind, might I ask\nyou to help me identify the culprit?
10	Y-you would? Really?\nThank you so much!
11	Um...maybe you could start by asking\naround among the locals?
12	Just bring me up casually in\nconversation, and see if anyone\nknows anything.
13	I'm sure the culprit must be someone\nliving in this city. Otherwise, I have no\nidea why they would...
14	I'll be waiting right here, so please\nlet me know if you find anything.
15	Could you go and talk to the\ntownsfolk, and look for clues\non who's spying on me?
16	I suppose I could be imagining the\nwhole thing, but I can't shake the\nfeeling I'm being watched...
17	Could it have anything to do with my\njoining the Choir of Indol?
qst002202_ms.json
1	You're not like that girl, are you?
2	I guess I can tell you, then.
3	There's this girl I've seen spying on\nMellica a lot lately. There were some\nnasty-looking guys with her, too.
4	I tried to get closer and find out what\nshe was up to, but she gave me the slip.
5	Wish I could tell you more, but that's\nall I've got.
qst002203_ms.json
1	What? You want to know about\nMellica?
2	She joined the Choir of Indol\nrecently, you know!
3	She was the only one in this whole\ncamp who passed the audition.
4	It's really prestigious to be\nin the Choir. Only the very best\nsingers are allowed to join!
5	When you're in the Choir, you get to\nsing at official ceremonies, like when\nthey're moving the Titan and stuff.
6	Is that all you wanted?\nSee you around, then!
qst002204_ms.json
1	Mellica? What about her?\nI don't know that much about\nthose fancy Choir types.
2	Though I could tell you a bit\nabout the Choir itself.
3	Apparently, once you join the Choir of\nIndol, you're basically set for life.
4	I mean, it's an official branch of the\nPraetorium, so naturally they get\nspecial treatment.
5	Us refugees don't get much in\nthe way of opportunities, so lots\nof folks dream of joining up.
6	Course, I didn't make it past the\naudition. My mom and dad were\nso disappointed.
7	Anyway, that's about all the\ninfo I've got.
qst002205_ms.json
1	You're looking for info on that\nChoir girl Mellica?
2	Mmmm... Sorry, but I don't really\nknow a lot about her.
3	Maybe you should try asking that\nUrayan girl, Albina.
4	She's a refugee, and she kept saying\nshe was going to make it into the Choir\nno matter what.
5	But I haven't seen her around lately.\nNot sure what she's up to.
6	That's about all I know, I'm afraid.
qst002206_ms.json
1	So, um...how did your investigation go?
2	So there was an Urayan girl in the\nrefugee camp who was trying to get\ninto the Choir just like me?
3	Albina... Albina...
4	I can't say I recognize the name.
5	But...
6	...
7	There was only one open spot at the\nlast audition. I guess because I passed,\nshe must have...
8	Um, could you come with me for a bit?\nI'd like to meet this Albina and talk to\nher in person.
9	I-it'll be all right! I can handle it!\nAs long as you're with me, I mean...
10	I want to talk this over properly!\nCome on, let's go!
qst002207_ms.json
1	Um... Hello! A-are you Albina?
2	Mellica...?
3	I never thought you'd come to me\non your own.
4	I was just wondering when the best\ntime would be to go and take you out.
5	T-take me...out...?
6	Y-you don't mean...\nyou want to...k-kill...?
7	Huh? I thought you knew that already.
8	Isn't that why you hired these\nDrivers to protect you?
9	N-no! These are just some kind\npeople who offered to help...
10	I just wanted to come and talk to you!
11	What's to talk about?
12	If it weren't for you, I would've\nmade it into the Choir.
13	I hate you so much, you witch.\nYou pig. You dirty little... Urghhh!
14	If it weren't for you...if I could\njust get rid of you...I could have\neverything I deserve!
15	I could get out of this hellish life\nand live like a respectable person!
16	I could give my mom and dad\nthe rest and comfort they need!
17	But violence isn't going to solve any-
18	Oh, but it will! And it's going to\nchange my life for the better!
19	I'm a refugee from Uraya, you know.
20	I know people in the mercenary biz.\nAnd once I kill you and join the Choir,\nI'll have the cash to pay them off!
21	Once I explained that, they\nwere glad to help.
22	So I'm sorry, but I'm going to have\nto make all of you disappear!
23	H-help! Please!
qst002208_ms.json
1	We...we lost...?
2	...
3	What am I going to do now...?\nI...I have to join the Choir, or I can't...
4	I can't take any more of this life!\nIf it weren't for you, I... I...
5	Albina... I don't know what kind of\nhardships you've been through.
6	But I don't think it's right to join the\nChoir in search of an easy life.
7	Do you think Praetor Amalthus would\nwant people to sing at his sacred\nceremonies for a reason like that?
8	What are you saying...?\nI'm the one in the wrong here...?
9	Oh, I get it. You think I'm just not\ngood enough to make it in the Choir.
10	Yes...that is what I think.
11	Just because you got lucky...\nYou've got some nerve...
12	I...I'm not trying to boast about\nmy own skills! I just think...
13	Go on. Say it.\nConvince me, if you think you can.
14	I...I don't think the Choir of Indol\nexists just to provide wealth to its\nown members!
15	I think the Choir exists to enrich the\nhearts of everyone who hears it, its\nown members included!
16	To join the Choir, you need to be able\nto wish for the happiness of others,\nand turn those feelings into song!
17	Those feelings are why the songs of\nthe Choir resonate with the people!
18	You can't bring happiness to anyone by\nsinging while thinking only of yourself!
19	That's why, um...I don't think...\nOh, I don't know how to say this...
20	...Well, how am I meant to\nargue with a speech like that?
21	Dammit, Mellica.\nI'm...sorry.
22	N-no, I...I'm the one who should be\nsorry... It really wasn't my place to\nsay all that...
23	You know the stupid thing?\nI love singing too. I really do.
24	So I guess...I'll try again.\nI'll sing for them again, and this\ntime I'll get through to them.
25	Maybe that way I can get the best\nof both worlds. A happy life...and\na happy heart.
26	You just wait, though.\nOne day, I'll make everyone see\nthat I'm a better singer than you!
27	Haha... I guess I should look\nforward to that, then...?
28	Thank you so much for all your\nhelp, everyone.
29	It was a lot scarier than I ever could\nhave thought, but I'm glad I managed\nto make up with Albina in the end.
30	This is for you, as thanks.\nI hope you'll come and listen\nto us sing sometime.

1	Oh, friends listen to Mololo?\nMololo have little problem right\nnow. Maybe friends can help.

4	Friends might not guess, but Mololo is\nbudding journalist! Wanting to write\narticle about security of Indol!
5	But then captured by zealous old\npreacher-man during investigating.

7	So maybe friends could investigate\ninstead? Quick-quick?
8	What? Friends still not investigate yet?\nMololo just want to know about\nnumber of guards in Sanctum at night.
9	Sanctum warrior monks should know\nall about details. They probably tell\nfriends without any problems.

5	Mololo just here to listen to very\ninspiring talks about glorious teachings\nof Praetor Amalthus!
6	Very well. I will trust you in this...
7	By the by, perhaps you could ask these\nfine people to deliver the item we were\ndiscussing to Malusio?
8	I-is really necessary?
9	Your path forward will not reveal itself\nuntil you take action, young one.
10	O-OK then.

12	Mololo want friends to deliver\nPlatinum Music Box to Malusio\nat Goetuis Port.

1	Mololo want friends to deliver\nPlatinum Music Box to Malusio\nat Goetuis Port.
qst002304_ms.json
1	It's so tough round here lately. With the\nanti-Blade protests gaining momentum,\nus guards don't have a moment's rest.
2	Don't the idiots see that getting rid of\nBlades isn't going to stop wars from\nhappening?
3	Oh, um...I guess I shouldn't say that,\nthough. Not exactly professional of me.
4	Good luck with your research, though!
qst002305_ms.json
1	Sorry, can't really talk now.\nMaybe when my guard shift's over...
2	Indol may be safer than most nations,\nbut we can't wipe out crime entirely.
3	And that, my friend, is why men like\nme have to keep careful watch every\nhour of the day!
4	So...yeah. Don't distract me, OK?
qst002306_ms.json
1	There's been a Nopon causing trouble\nin the city lately, so I've been called in\nto cover extra guard shifts!
2	Honestly, some people are just\nso inconsiderate...
3	So yeah, I guess I can tell you that\nthere are more guards than normal.\nNot giving any specific numbers, mind.
qst002307_ms.json
1	How many guards are there\nhere at night?
2	Uh, I can't say I know exactly.
3	That's a weird thing to be asking\naround about, though.
4	What kind of article is that for exactly?\nI'm pretty curious to read it now!
qst002308_ms.json
1	Wh-whoa! Who're you?!\nI wasn't slacking off, I swear!
2	R-research? You're looking into\nthe security of Indol?
3	Oh, go on then. I'll tell you what you\nwant to know. Just don't mention me\nin that article, OK?
4	There are 23 guards here at night.\nIs that all you were after?
5	Now I'm gonna get back to my guard\nstation, so PLEASE don't tell anyone\nyou saw me here...
qst002309_ms.json
1	What's this you have brought?
2	A Platinum Music Box?!
3	Why, this is the very same music box\nthat was stolen from me...
4	I see... So you were the culprits.\nCome to turn yourselves in, is that it?
5	Then I shall pass judgment in the\nname of the Praetor Amalthus.
6	Oh, you were just asked to bring this\nby a Nopon named Mololo?
7	Do you know where I might\nfind this Nopon, perchance?\nPlease, take me to him.
8	Evildoers must be judged!
qst002310_ms.json
1	Mololo offer deepest gratitude to\nfriends for completing errand.
2	This is Mololo?\nAnd you're sure he is the Nopon\nwho stole my Platinum Music Box?
3	He does not strike me as a\ndastardly criminal...
4	Chief of Guard Malusio most correct.\nMololo is sinful Nopon, has made\nmany terrible mistakes.
5	But wonderful old man Sephrian\nkindly grant Mololo forgiveness\nin name of Praetor Amalthus.
6	Mololo is changed Nopon!\nDevoted to path of goodness!
7	...
8	We must trust in young Mololo's words.\nNobody is beyond salvation.
9	The Praetor's teachings and the\nglory of Indol have saved this\npoor sinner's soul!
10	My dream is to convey the Praetor's\nteachings to all the people of Alrest!
11	Old man Sephrian most wise!\nMololo follow teachings for all life now!
12	Hmmmm...
13	If the devout Master Sephrian is\nconvinced, I suppose it is not my\nplace to argue.
14	Thanks to friends, Mololo is free\nfrom life of sin!
15	My dear friends, you have saved poor\nyoung Mololo from his own sinful heart\nand righted his past wrongdoings.
16	Would you care to become\nmy disciples?
17	Would have liked to study teachings\nwith friends. Very much disappoint.
18	Ah yes...Mololo tells me he has caused\nyou all a great deal of trouble, correct?
19	Please take this as compensation.\nIt is only right that a master should\natone for his disciple's failings.
20	This is of little use to me, with my oath\nof non-violence, but perhaps you will\nfind some use for it.
qst002311_ms.json
1	I have devoted my life to spreading the\nteachings of the Indoline Praetorium.
2	Much as I would like to share these\nwonders with you all...
3	Right now, I have my hands full\nwith explaining matters of the soul\nto this Nopon fellow.
4	Young Mololo will soon be a changed\nNopon, you mark my words.
5	So please, do as he asks and perform\nthis small favor.
6	You will not regret this good deed,\nI promise you.
qst002312_ms.json
1	Master Sephrian's preachings are\nalways so inspiring.
2	I'm glad I came all this way to listen.
3	I...I think I can feel tears welling\nup in my eyes...
4	Did you know, Master Sephrian\napparently committed some kind\nof terrible sin earlier in his life?
5	But his soul was saved by faith.
6	I hope he can save the soul of\nthat Nopon, too.
qst002401_ms.json
1	They died clinging to their notebook.\nIt must be very important to them...
2	It mentions Litharia Snowfield.\nI wonder if that's important somehow...
3	Looks like this guy died clutching his\nnotebook.
4	Litharia Snowfield, it says. Wonder\nwhat that's got to do with anything...
5	It look like this person grip notebook\ntight, even in grip of death...
6	Notebook mention Litharia Snowfield.\nMaybe that important place?
7	This person died holding their\nnotebook tightly.
8	It mentions Litharia Snowfield. I wonder\nwhat relevance that might have...
9	Looks like this guy copped it clinging\nto his notebook...
10	I see something in there about Litharia\nSnowfield. Wonder what's up with that?
qst002402_ms.json
1	Ekurt? Yes, that's me...
2	What do you want?
3	?!
4	Are...are you quite sure?\nAzgall's...dead...?\nI can't...
5	This is Azgall's...\nThen it's true...
6	He fought right up until the end...\nbut it wasn't enough...
7	He used to salvage with me, back in\nthe day.
8	Well, one day, I messed up big time and\nlost my radar, leaving me adrift in the\nCloud Sea. This was many years ago...
9	It was looking bleak for me. I'd run out\nof air, nearly done for. But then Azgall\ncame and found me.
10	Turns out he'd pushed himself to\nhis limits on the way, though.\nHe collapsed himself not long after.
11	So the both of us ended up\ndrifting to Tantal.
12	But, as you know...Tantal is a closed\ncountry.
13	Getting back to Mor Ardain wasn't an\noption.
14	Luckily, we managed to get the help of\na few kind souls. So we made a home\nhere.
15	I put down roots. Lived a normal life.
16	But not Azgall.
17	He didn't really take to life\nhere. Said he wanted to go\nback to Mor Ardain.
18	That's what he told me the last time I\nsaw him, anyway...
19	It's not easy to get out of Tantal\non your own. I was doing what\nI could to help.
20	But... I didn't think he'd wind up dying\nright here in Tantal.
21	...
22	You should take the things from his\nburied chest.
23	I'm not a salvager anymore, so they're\nno use to me. He'd be happy to have\nthem be useful to someone, I expect.
24	Anyway, thank you. I'm grateful to you\nfor finding Azgall.
25	Yes, it's put our minds at rest.

1	Pleasure to meet friends.\nMe is Humhum, researcher of history.
2	Dream of Humhum is to visit all\nhistorical architecture of Tantal!
3	And this partner of Humhum, avid\nclimber of cliffs and ruin walls!
4	Hi, I'm Mylak.
5	I'm not really interested in history\nor any of that. I just like finding\nnew things to climb.
6	Anyway, we both came here to\ncheck out these sweet ruins.
7	Did friends know this?
8	Current capital of Tantal, Theosoir,\npositioned right at top of Titan Genbu.\nRight next to upper wall.
9	But long time ago, Tantal people\nlive lower down, in Genbu Drifts.
10	Monsters and Cloud Sea effects slowly\ndrive living space further up.
11	So people live in these ruins too once!
12	Probably lots of thousand years\nago though.
13	You talk too much, Humhum. Can we\njust head to the next wall already?
14	Mylak shoosh and listen!
15	Sometimes Humhum not know why\nhang out with musclebrain man...\nMylak not appreciate ruins properly!
16	Well, no, I don't really get what's so\nspecial about them. So can we head\non to the next wall now?
17	Humhum get angry now! No more ruin\nexploring with silly climbing man!
18	Hah, well that's fine by me.\nHow're you going to make it up\nthese walls on your own, though?
19	Did you learn to climb by yourself\nwhile you were riding on my backpack\nall this time?
20	Hah! Wall climbing too easy!\nMylak just watch!
21	Ah...
22	Meh-meeeeeehhhhhh!
23	Humhuuuum!
24	Urgh... Right into the middle of those\nmonsters! We have to go and help!
25	But I'm no good for anything but\nclimbing... How am I meant to make it\nthrough a whole pack of those things...?
26	Thanks... I really owe you one.\nPlease make sure Humhum is safe!
qst002502_ms.json
1	Humhum fell into the Tamie Pillars\nsomewhere.
2	Nopon bodies are pretty springy, so I\ndon't think the fall will have hurt him...
3	But please, you have to help\nmy partner!
qst002503_ms.json
1	Thank friends kindly!
2	Huh? Where is Mylak?\nNot with friends?
3	Oh no... Mylak get eaten by\nscary monsters?!
4	How tragic...\nLosing partner of long time...
5	What shall we say about Mylak?
6	He was really worried about you
7	He might not care about you at all
8	Oh... Mylak waiting for Humhum\nvery worried?
9	Of course Mylak worry. Partners\nnever separate from silly wordfight!
10	Must go back to Mylak and\nshow him Humhum safe!
11	Meh-meh-meh?!
12	Mylak is man of such cold heart?!
13	Humhum must go back and lecture\nMylak on meaning of friendship!
14	Friends come with Humhum!
qst002504_ms.json
1	Humhum! Thank Elysium you're OK...
2	Hmph. Mylak surprisingly friendly now.
3	Wha- Hey, shaddup! Actually, I take\nthat back. I wish those monsters HAD\neaten you now!
4	Mylak bad liar.\nAlready say "thank Elysium"\nwhen seeing Humhum safe!
5	Just like Humhum thought,\nMylak brains made of only muscle!
6	Bah... Why don't you team up with\nsome other climber, then?!
7	But Mylak have great braveness.\nClimbing even highest wall without fear.
8	Humhum need Mylak as partner.\nMylak please stay with Humhum?
9	Hah... There isn't a wall in Alrest I can't\nclimb. You can count on me, partner!
10	Thank you friends for saving Humhum!\nVery helpful actually.
11	Please, take this as thanks.\nWe owe you one big time.
qst002601_ms.json
1	No no no...\nWhere could it be?
2	Ah, hiya!
3	Have you seen a rock shaped like\na turtle anywhere? It's only little...
4	I dropped it someplace when I was\nplaying outside the city yesterday.
5	I looked and looked and looked\nbut I couldn't find it anywhere...
6	The stupid snow probably\nburied it by now.
7	If I don't find it soon, even more\nsnow will fall and it'll be lost forever.
8	Um, so, like, um, my dad gave\nme that stone. Said it'd help\nme grow up big and strong.
9	That was before he left.\nMum said he went a really\nsuper long way away.
10	But I'm not lonely... Least,\nI wasn't when I had my turtle\nstone to remind me of him.
11	I wonder if Mr. Turtle is\nall right. I hope he's not lonely.\nI gotta find him soon...
12	You'll help?\nThank you thank you thank you!
13	I'm going to keep looking around\nhere a bit longer, so you go check\naround near Amphoret Pillar, OK?
14	I was over there yesterday so\nI might have dropped it then.
15	I'll keep looking around here.
16	You go look around Amphoret Pillar.
17	I was over there yesterday so\nI might have dropped it then.
qst002602_ms.json
1	Ah! What's that on the ground?\nIs it Lucarion's turtle carving?
2	Oh, look at that! Could it be the carving\nthat Lucarion kid was looking for?
3	Meh! Fallen thingy...\nMaybe is thing Lucarion looking for?
4	Ah, I've spotted something.\nPerhaps it's that child's lost item.
5	Ah! That thing on the ground. Is that\nLucarion's Turters?
6	Ahhh! A Graaz Pippito\nran off with it!
7	If that's what he's looking for\nthen we need to get it back to him!
8	Hey! That Graaz Pippito\nran off with it!
9	If that's what he's looking for\nthen we need to get it back to him!
10	Meh-meh!\nNasty Graaz Pippito ran off with item!
11	If that what he looking for, then\nwe need to get it back to him!
12	Did that thieving Graaz Pippito\njust make off with the item?
13	If that's what he was looking for,\nthen we must make haste.
14	Ugh! That Graaz Pippito just\nsnatched it from under our noses!
15	If that's what he was looking for, then\nwe gotta get it back to him sharpish.
qst002603_ms.json
1	Wow!\nYou found it! You really found it!
2	Yay!\nI had no idea what I was going to do\nwithout it. Thank you so much!
3	Here! Take this!
4	Hehe, it's nice, right?\nI love these!
5	When I grow up, I wanna be a\ncool helper-outer person too!
6	Hey, I challenge you to a snowball\nfight next time we meet!
qst002701_ms.json
1	Ugh! Curse those Idle Rodonya!
2	I'm so close to completing this\nconcoction! I won't allow them\nto get in the way!
3	Huh? What do you want?\nIn case you couldn't tell, I'm busy here.\nI don't have time to be dealing with...
4	Oh? You wouldn't happen\nto be a Driver, would you?
5	Well, why didn't you say so\nin the first place?!
6	Listen, I happen to have just\nthe job for you.
7	It's not a particularly difficult job, and\nI promise I'll reward you handsomely!
8	So what do you say?\nWill you do it?
9	...Oh, all right, I suppose you deserve\na tad more explanation than that.
10	The thing is, I'm working on a certain\nmedicinal concoction. It's top secret.
11	If I manage to complete it, I should be\nable to help people across the world!
12	But just as my research is nearing\nits end, I've run into a little snag.
13	A bunch of Idle Rodonya have\nsettled down in the only place I can\nprocure a key herbal ingredient!
14	So I was wondering if you could\nclear them out for me. Simple\nenough, right?
15	It's for the sake of the greater good!\nYou know you want to do it.
16	Thanks! You're a beacon of\nshining hope for us all!
17	(...Heheh, some people are so gullible.)
18	What?! I didn't say anything!\nAnyway, about where to find those\npesky Idle Rodonya...
19	They reside somewhere in the\nArgan Iceblooms.
20	I'm counting on you to do this.\nFor me, and for the whole world!\n(Heheh...)
21	Oh, hello again!\nDid you defeat those Idle Rodonya\nfor me already?
22	What? You didn't?
23	I told you, you can find them in the\nArgan Iceblooms. Quick!
24	Don't forget, the whole world\nis counting on you!
25	Oh, my! You really did defeat\nthem all! I knew turning to you\nwas the right decision.
26	Yes, now my concoction should be\ncomplete in no time! Yes...finally...
27	Ahah... Ahahah...\nAhahahahahahahahahahah!
28	Oh, I've been waiting for this\nmoment for so long. You have no idea\nof the struggles I've been through!
29	But now! My life's work! Is complete!\nI will finally be united with my darling!
30	The flames of passion I have\nharbored so long will finally\nbe rewarded!
31	I think we have questions.
32	Ask if helping the world was all a lie
33	Ask what this medicinal concoction is
34	Oh, no. I would never lie about\nsuch a wondrous creation!
35	Once I mass-produce this concoction,\npeople across the world will no longer\nhave to suffer unrequited love!
36	With the help of this miracle potion,\ntheir feelings will be reciprocated!
37	And of course, that includes me.\nMy beloved will finally be mine!
38	Very well! As thanks for all your help,\nI will tell you its name!
39	The concoction I have been researching\nis a powerful brew that will fill any who\ndrink it with pure romantic passion!
40	I call it...the Love Potion!
41	And I will be the first to use it\nto claim my beloved's heart!
42	I really couldn't have done it\nwithout you, you know!
43	Here's your reward, as promised.\nI hope you're pleased with yourselves!
44	Thank you again, my cupids of love!\nI'll let you know once all my dreams\ncome true! Ahaha!
qst002801_ms.json
1	It's a pleasure. You may not know me,\nbut I certainly know of you.
2	You're the ones who defeated the\nterrible Aeshma, aren't you?
3	Given your apparent skill, there is\nsomething I would like to ask of you.\nWill you hear me out?
4	I am a member of the\nTechnological Research Center.
5	And the object you see beside me\nis the remains of a weapon used in a\ngreat war, in an age long past.
6	I intend to research how it operated\nand the functions it served.
7	With any luck, we can use it as\ninspiration to develop modern\nweapons for the Ardainian army!
8	There are similar weapons strewn\nall across Temperantia.
9	I would appreciate it if you could\nhelp me to collect them.
10	I believe there are a large number of\nthese weapon relics out there, but\nfour should be plenty for my purposes.
11	I'm counting on you to bring me\nsome excellent research samples!
12	Beside me is the remains of a weapon\nused in a great war in an age long past.
13	I would like you to retrieve four\nothers like it.
14	They're strewn all across Temperantia,\nso you'll likely need to hunt high and\nlow for them!
15	Ah, I see you have finished collecting\nthe ancient weapons. Very impressive.
16	You have my gratitude.\nWith these, my research should\nprogress by leaps and bounds!
17	I'm sorry I had to bother you all\nwith such a menial task.
18	All the soldiers stationed here\nare from Division One of the\nSecond Imperial Guard, you know.
19	I tried asking them for help, but they\nhave their hands full guarding Aeshma,\nso I was sadly rejected.
20	So we have a fair bit of research\nfunds to spare. I'll be sure to pay\nyou handsomely!
21	You have tax gold from the Ardainian\npeople to spare?
22	N-no! That's not what I meant at all...
23	But...perhaps you are right to admonish\nme, Special Inquisitor. I should have\nmore respect for Ardainian gold.
24	It was foolish of me to suggest\nwantonly giving away money just\nbecause we have a generous budget.
25	To demonstrate my repentance, I will\nreduce your reward for this task to 0G.
26	I hope that will suffice.
27	V...very good.

2	DB Sisters from Larus Trade Guild\nfollow you here on commission\nfrom Ardainian Army.
3	But thinking about it, it obvious\nthat only potential customers\ncrazy enough to come here is you.

6	So Dibidi will graciously let you off\nif you help Dibidi with request.
7	Dibidi would like friends\nto collect sellable items\nfrom Cliffs of Morytha.

9	Then Dibidi forgive your deception.
10	Got it?
11	This Dibidi's first time here so not\nknow exactly what to look for. Just\npick up anything that look valuable.
12	Thank you, friends!
13	Anything from Cliffs of Morytha make\nsurefire profit in other countries, so\nDibidi accept anything you find!
14	You find something for Dibidi?
15	Is not enough yet...\nKeep going!
16	Meh meh!\nFriends gathered much stuff!
17	You make Dibidi very happy.
qst002902_ms.json
1	Please bring Bidibi\nsome Linka Honey.
2	Do not need anything else.\nBidibi give to Dibidi.
3	Still need Linka Honey...
4	This enough Linka Honey for\nBidibi to bathe in!
5	Even though Bidibi was\ntricky-fooled into coming to\nsuch a place, it worth it in end.
6	Thank-thanks!
qst002903_ms.json
1	That Linka Honey...\nYou not give to Dibidi yet!
2	Bidibi is sisterpon of Dibidi.\nSweet tooth is very strong...
3	And Dibidi definitely just\nwant sisterpon to be happy.
4	So will friends show Linka Honey\nto Bidibi? Just for one moment...?
5	That color...that scent...\nDreamy-dreamy!
6	Bidibi want more of this.
7	Bidibi buy as much Linka Honey\nas friends can bring...
8	Big reward get even bigger, OK?
qst002904_ms.json
1	OK, that satisfactory!
2	Dibidi think Ardainian Army very\nmean to trick us like that, but actually\nwe get pretty good haul!
3	Me and Sisterpon happy to keep\nselling useful items to friends.
4	Thank you for continued patronage!
5	Look like you fulfilled request of\nBidibi as well.
6	She love honey so much that\nshe smiling wing to wing.
7	Thank you for humoring greedy\nwishes of sisterpon.
8	But request of Bidibi not fulfilled yet.

8	What's that all about?
9	What could that mean?
qst003101_ms.json
1	I'm a bit tied up right now. Could this\nwait till I'm done, you reckon?
2	Things are really not great here,\nto be honest. The distribution centers\nhave been a total mess lately.
3	We're pinched for resources as it is.\nAnd now we've got all these Indoline\nrefugees flooding in...
4	The civilians here in Uraya are getting\npretty cranky with us soldiers, too.
5	It's a real mess. We should be helping\neach other, not biting each other's\nheads off...
6	It's a big blow for everyone here...\nFor the refugees, and for the folks\nwho were here before.
7	There are three distribution centers\nhere in Fonsa Myma, and all of them\nare running into problems right now.
8	We'd be all right if we just had more\nsupport. But right now, it's taking all we\nhave just to cope with our own issues.
9	You guys reckon you could lend a\nhand, do ya?
10	If you could help us out, it'd give us a\nlittle breathing space to get a handle\non things.
11	Maybe we could do something to get\nthe civilians to calm down a bit.
12	We're a bit short on food supplies here.\nThat'd be our first request, I imagine...\nThink you'd be up for helping out?
13	Thanks a bunch.
14	Like I've said before, there are three\ndistribution centers in total.
15	There's this one, and the one at\nGwendle Repair Dock, and then\none more in Fonsa Myma Port.
16	Each has its own problems, so you'll\nhave to talk to the guys in charge\nseparately. For us, it's Velmo here.
17	I owe you one. We can't give you much\nin return, but we're counting on you!
18	So can you help out with our\ndistribution operation?
19	The distribution centers are found\nhere, in Gwendle Repair Dock, and\nFonsa Myma Port.
20	We're counting on you.
qst003102_ms.json
1	Oh! You'll assist us with our distribution\noperations, will you?
2	That's really a great help to us.
3	The main thing that this place lacks\nis cuisine based on fresh vegetables.
4	If you could find some for us, that\nwould really improve our service.
5	Thank you so much.
6	This seems to be plenty.
7	Thank you so very much.
8	We were never this busy before the\nIndoline refugees arrived.
9	Still, I fully understand their\npredicament.
10	It's a difficult time for all of us.
11	These people have no choice.\nWith Indol gone, they had to\ncome here to survive.
12	In time, they'll make new lives for\nthemselves here.
13	We can't just turn them away in their\nhour of need.
14	But, anyway, thanks a lot.\nThanks to you we can do a lot more\nto help.
15	We really need some vegetable-based\nmeals here. It would be great if you\ncould provide us with some.
qst003103_ms.json
1	What?\nYou're gonna lend us a hand, are you?
2	For real? Appreciate it.
3	We're short of meat-based meals at\nthis distribution center.
4	Reckon you could get a few meaty\ndishes made up and bring 'em here?
5	Thanks for the help. Things are looking\na little brighter for us now.
6	We've been pretty busy since all these\nIndoline refugees showed up.
7	Sometimes I think it'd be easier if we\njust sent 'em back.
8	We're struggling to feed our own\npeople here.
9	People start to get a bit edgy when\nthey see us doling out food to these\nIndolines.
10	To be honest, they've caused quite a bit\nof trouble recently.
11	Don't get me wrong, I've got a lot of\nsympathy for these refugees, after what\nhappened...
12	They'll probably end up having to live\nhere, so we need to try and calm things\ndown as much as possible.
13	But thanks for all your help.\nI feel like we have a chance now.
14	We're short of meat-based meals here.\nCountin' on ya.
qst003104_ms.json
1	You'll help us with our supply\noperations?
2	I thank you.
3	We're short of fish-based meals here.
4	If you could make a few fishy dishes\nand bring them to us, that would really\nease the burden.
5	Thanks a lot for your assistance!
6	Our services have been a bit strained\nsince the Indoline refugees arrived.
7	Us soldiers are stretched to the\nabsolute limit here, already.
8	Honestly, having to worry about all\nthese refugees on top of it all is just\nabout pushing us over the edge.
9	But you lot have really eased up the\nburden!
10	I think we've got a much better chance\nof helping out all these needy people\nnow!
11	Thank you so much! We're indebted to\nyou!
qst003105_ms.json
1	Helped out all three distribution\ncenters, did you?
2	We really appreciate that.\nThanks.
3	The Urayan folks were really under\npressure there. They were ready to\nturn nasty on those refugees.
4	It ain't right, but compassion starts to\nseem like a luxury when people get\ndesperate.
5	We're all guilty of it. If you can't look\nafter yourself, you start to think you\ncan't help others.
6	But thanks to you, we've got the\nwherewithal to not be so selfish.
7	This will make everyone's lives a\nwhole lot easier.
8	Thanks for all your help, guys!

1	Oh no oh no oh no!\nI'm... He's... Ohh, what\nam I going to do?!
2	I can't go and help him myself!
3	Oh, it's terrible!
4	Bonono has gone flying!
5	Nothing is all right! Everything is awful!
6	Oh...right. I guess I should explain\nfrom the beginning.
7	Well, I was living in Indol, see...
8	But apparently Indol's done for,\nso we all tried to get ourselves\non the first ship out of there!
9	It was pretty crazy, actually.\nEveryone from the refugee camp\ndescending on the port all at once...
10	Thankfully, I managed to get safely\nonto a ship, but then right when\nmy friend Bonono tried to get on...
11	Kabaaaam!\nThe whole of Indol got whacked\ninto the World Tree!
12	And Bonono...he went flying!\nClean off Indol, he went!
13	And now? If he fell in Cloud Sea, well,\nhe's had it. But if he landed on the Tree\nitself...
14	I have no idea if he's still alive...\nBut I feel like I've got to do something!
15	R-really?! You'll help me look?!\nOh, please find him for me!
16	If he's all right, I think he'll be on the\nouter wall of the World Tree.
17	But if he fell into the Cloud Sea, I guess\nthere really isn't any hope...
18	Please find my friend Bonono for me!
qst003202_ms.json
1	Shivery-shivery!\nChittery-chattery!
2	Bonono thought Bonono about to get\neated by scary mystery monsters!
3	But just when Bonono about to give up,\nflashy Drivers appear from nowhere!
4	Thank you, Driver friends!
5	Can friends help bash up nasty\nmonsters that try to hurt Bonono?
qst003203_ms.json
1	Much thanks for help!
2	One moment please!
3	Nopon girl called Alulu near here.\nFell from Indol together with Bonono.
4	Bonono and Alulu were traveling\ntogether, but got split up!
5	Bonono very worried! What if Alulu\nget eated by mystery monsters too?!\nCan Driver friends help?
6	Not super sure where Alulu went, but\nBonono think probably further down.
7	Thank friends greatly!\nAlulu probably very scared,\nso please search quick-quick!
qst003204_ms.json
1	Alulu! It Alulu!
2	Friends come to help Alulu?
3	Alulu manage to fight monsters little\nbit thanks to Blade here...
4	But monsters is too many!\nNot able to fighting any more!
5	Alulu leave rest to friends...
qst003205_ms.json
1	Alulu, you all right? Not hurt?
2	Alulu just happy to see\nBonono safe too!
3	Thank friends greatly for helping!
4	Experienced Drivers quite\namazing strong!
5	Oh, friends wondering about Blade?
6	Alulu met Blade soon after got\nseparated from Bonono.
7	Was running scared from monsters,\nwhen Core Crystal fall from above!
8	Alulu think, ooh, what pretty stone,\nwould like to give as present to friends.\nSo reach out and grab crystal.
9	But then Crystal resonate with Alulu!
10	Blade appear out of nowhere\nand protect Alulu from monsters!
11	Alulu very amazing!
12	Not amazing, only very lucky!
13	Anyway, staying here dangerous.\nProbably should go somewhere safer.
14	What? Friend Aki send Driver friends\nhere because worried about Bonono?
15	Wow! Friendship really save lives!
16	Time to go back to Port Anangham\nin Mor Ardain and find Aki then!
17	Alulu come with too!
18	OK! Alulu come!
qst003206_ms.json
1	Bonono?! Bonono!\nThank the Architect you're alive!
2	Bonono was almost not so alive!\nIf friends show up later, Bonono\nprobably monster food.
3	Was quite thrilling experience.
4	Especially flying from Indol!\nThat probably new record flight\ndistance of Nopon!
5	Not get thrills like that every day!\nBonono kind of want to try again!
6	...Please don't do that...
7	Alulu never want to fall like that again...
8	Who's this girl?
9	Oh, this Alulu. She fall from Indol\nto World Tree together with Bonono.
10	Alulu thought would die when crash\ninto World Tree. But landed on Bonono\ninstead. Nice and fluffy landing.
11	Wow...you totally saved her life!\nI guess you did something cool\nfor once there, Bonono.
12	What Aki mean by "for once"?!
13	Then when Alulu get attacked by\nmonsters, Bonono run away faster\nthan legs can carry Bonono.
14	Urk...
15	Meanwhile Alulu make new Blade\nfriend and bash up three monsters!
16	Wow... You're way cooler than Bonono.
17	Ooh, friend Aki make Alulu blush!
18	W-well, important thing is everyone\nsafe now! Happy end for all!
19	Yeah, I guess that's true.\nWe should be thanking these\nbrave Drivers.

3	Nobody live here!\nShatoto has no moneycoins for inn.\nJust take little nap!
4	Besides, when Shatoto come to town,\nsoldiers say "give money!" and Shatoto\npay residence fee like good citizen.
5	Huh? Meh?\nWhy surprise?
6	Meh meh! No need residence fee\nto enter town?!
7	Shatoto was duped...\nShatoto's beautiful money, all gone...
8	Meeeeeh... Shatoto's long-desired foods\nwere finally available in Gormott...
9	Wanted to use money from Mamapon\nto buy delicious foods...
10	Shatoto is sorry, Mamapon!
11	Meh? Friends will bring delicious\nfoods for Shatoto?
12	Yay!\nYay!\nHappy times!
13	When Shatoto was littlepon, he met\nman called Attas in Argentum.
14	Attas become very fond of local\ndelicacy of Noodle Soup at that time.
15	Shatoto want to try Torigoth Noodle\nSoup, so here Shatoto is!
16	Many years pass, and Shatoto not\nlittlepon anymore. Wonder if Attas still\nmaking Noodle Soup...?
17	But Shatoto has no money, so if go to\nnoodle place, all he hear is "no noodles\nfor Shatoto" and other sad things.
18	If Shatoto could eat Noodle Soup of\nAttas, Shatoto would be able to go\nback to home, full-tummy smiley.
19	Friends are the first nice people\nShatoto has met.\nSoldiers are too shouty scary...
20	Argentum Noodle Soup with\nTorigoth flair...\nWhat could taste be like?
21	Shatoto has never eaten Torigoth\nfoods so difficult to imagine.
22	So hungry...
23	Tummy is rumbly grumbly... Meh!\nWhat is delicious smell?
24	Ruska Noodle Soup?\nSo this is Torigoth-style\nNoodle Soup invented by Attas!
25	It look totally different to\nArgentum Noodle Soup.
26	Come to Dadapon!
27	*slurp* *gulp*\n*gulp* *slurp*
28	Ahhh.
29	Tinglyhot soup...\nChewysoft noodles...\nCrispycrunch veggies...
30	This is delicious evolution of\nArgentum Noodle Soup from\nchildhood of Shatoto!
31	It was very yummy!\nThank you, friends.\nAhhh!
32	Thank you.\nShatoto will have happy memories\nof this day.
33	Shatoto will save so he can\nbring Mamapon here and\nfeed delicious noodles!

1	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Hey, come on. Give me a break!
2	We're selling our stuff as cheap as can\nbe!
3	This Ardainian factory stuff's right over\nthe odds!
4	And now the water supply's off! When\nare they going to fix that ruddy water\ntower?
5	How am I supposed to raise my leeks\nwithout water? I wish these smart-arse\nArdainians had an answer to that!
6	Give over will ya? It wasn't us\nArdainians who smashed up the\nwater tower.
7	The people who did that are...
8	...those Drivers over there! If you want\nto complain, complain to those wee\nbastards!
9	What? That's who smashed up our\nlovely water tower?
10	Thanks to your little demolition job,\nI've got to lug water by hand to my\nfields. It's doing my back in!
11	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]I think I'll take my mind off it by giving\nyour arses a little kick!
12	Oh!\nLady Mòrag!
13	I apologize for inconveniencing you\nlike this, ma'am.
14	'Inconveniencing'? That's a fine way\nof putting it. We're just trying to have\na civil talk about important stuff!
15	Hey, you. Are you this soldier's\nsuperior or something?
16	Then I guess you won't listen to us\nany better than he does.
17	Nae bother.\nLet us make it crystal clear!
qst003402_ms.json
1	Gah...\nUrgh...
2	So, you had to break the water tower\nto get away from the Ardainian\nsoldiers?
3	It's sort of their fault then, really.
4	I can't really blame you lot for\nsomething you did when you were\ncornered.
5	Ah, nothing changes, does it? These\nmighty forces do what they like, and\nus little fellows pay the price.
6	Hey, aren't you the ones who brought\nthat Melosian Honey earlier?
7	My daughter's not got much of an\nappetite, but she can't resist ruska\ncookies with a bit of Melosian Honey.
8	I suppose I can let you off that\nargy-bargy with the water tower,\nfor bringing us that.
9	But next time you're taking on that\nArdainian bunch, try and spare a\nthought for the rest of us, yeah?
qst003501_ms.json
1	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Hey, Kallum!!! Give it back!
2	My da salvaged that for me! It's\nimportant to me!
3	Oh, salvaged goods, eh? Where did he\nsalvage it from?
4	Th-there's this salvage spot\nin the relay base...
5	What, from inside the base?
6	Well, that means it's Ardainian\nproperty! So it's mine!
7	Th-the Salvager's Code says salvaged\ngoods belong to whoever-
8	Shut it, you! Why don't you just go and\nsalvage another one?
9	Do that, and maybe I'll give you this\none back.
10	Th...that's not fair!\nI can't just...
11	Whatever. I'm not going to give it to\nyou for nothing.
12	Dad...*sniff*...I'm so sorry...
13	There's no way I can get another\nMorph Orb like the one my da got me...
14	My da wanted to become a Driver, see.
15	Said we'd have a better life if he was\na Driver. Better than being a veg\nfarmer anyway.
16	B-but when he touched the Crystal...\nIt...it was horrible... There was all this\nblood, and then he...he just...
17	So, um...my da isn't going to be\nsalvaging any more Morph Orbs...
18	That one was all I had\nto remember him by...
19	You're going to salvage me one?\nThank you!
20	My da said he was in the relay\nbase when he salvaged it.
21	But I don't know how you'd\nget in there...
qst003502_ms.json
1	Why does Kallum have to be so\nnasty? Those Ardainians think\nthey can do what they like...
2	The grown-ups in Torigoth don't seem\nvery happy about having all these\nArdainian soldiers around, either...
3	If everyone keeps being nasty like\nthis, we might end up at war...
qst003503_ms.json
1	A Morph Orb!\nThis is just like my da's.
2	Thanks a million! You're a right good\nbunch of Drivers and Blades!
3	Hey, Kallum! I got a Morph Orb.\nSame as the other one!
4	It really is just like it...
5	Hmph. All right, I guess you can\nhave the other one back then.
6	But if I see your dad "salvaging"\nround our Ardainian base again...
7	I'll tell my dad we've got a spy sniffing\nround!
8	...You needn't worry on that score...
9	Huh?
10	My da's dead.\nThanks to those Ardainian\narmy recruiters...
11	Hey, Kallum... You said that\nMorph Orb was yours 'cos it came\nfrom the Ardainian base, right?
12	Then what about my da?\nIt's Mor Ardain's fault he's dead...\nDoes that make it your-
13	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]W-what?!
14	I-I didn't... I wouldn't...
15	Us Gormotti and you Ardainians...\nWe're always at each other's throats.\nIt never seems to stop.
16	Sooner or later it's going to\nturn to violence...
17	Violence? You don't mean...w-war?
18	Your dad's pretty important\nin Mor Ardain, right?
19	Then maybe you can do something to\nprevent that from happening!
20	I-I don't think there's anything I can do.\nMy dad isn't that great really...
21	What? You think you can help?
22	Yeah, look! These people come from\nall sorts of different places! And you\ndon't see them fighting each other!
23	If they can do it, surely we can too...
24	Hmph! Well, when I become rich\nand famous, I'm gonna stop all war\nfor good!
25	Pain and suffering is stupid anyway!
26	Thanks again for your kind help! \nYou've taught us a lesson.
27	Hey, Kallum! How about you teach me\nsome Ardainian games!
28	I heard everyone plays this game called\nChooby Tubes in Mor Ardain, right?
29	Sure, I'll teach you to play\nChooby Tubes. It's my favorite game!
30	But you'd better treat me to one\nof those Lunana Smoothies in return!
31	Sure! C'mon, let's go get some!
qst003504_ms.json
1	What do you want? It's us Ardainians\nkeeping this place safe, you know.
2	So of course we get to boss the\nGormotti folk around a little!
qst003601_ms.json
1	Oh, you must be the ones Moui\nmentioned. Looking to join the\nMilitia Corps, are you?
2	You just wanted to help out?\nWell, that's a shame.
3	Very well. I'll tell you about it.
4	I ordered a load of stuff, but it hasn't\narrived yet.
5	It was at the Nopon Camp in the nether\nparts of Gormott where I ordered it.\nA Nopon lass called Mopopo, it was.
6	I don't get it... All the other stuff I\nordered from them came when they\nsaid it would. Maybe something's up.
7	Maybe a monster or something got 'em.\nI'd be no good helping 'em with\nsomething like that.
8	That's why I asked Moui if he'd send\nsome good fighters over...
9	The Nopon Camp's out on the\nGaranti Plain. Right near the Waytree,\nit is.
10	I know it's a big job, but do you mind\ngoing to the Nopon Camp and seeing\nwhat's up with them?
11	It'd really help us out if you could do\nthat. Thanks a million!
12	The Nopon Camp's out on the\nGaranti Plain. Right near the Waytree,\nit is.
13	I hope they just lost track of time when\nthey stopped for lunch or something.
14	Oh, you're back! What what was it?\nIt wasn't a monster or something was\nit?
15	Huh? She wouldn't bring it because\nthe delivery fees have changed? Oh...
16	But you brought it for me instead?
17	That's very good of you. I'm sorry to\nput you out like that.
18	But thank you so much! You really\nhelped me out there!
19	I did always think the charges were\na bit high. This explains a lot...
20	If they've been adding on extra\ncharges, I'm all for cracking down on\nthat. But if she won't deliver at all...
21	Oh? It sounded like she had a\ncraving for Tasty Sausages?\nThe little gannet...
22	That little Mopopo's always munching\nsomething on her way home, she is.
23	She only has to get wind of any fad\nfood or new delicacy, and she can't\nwait to try it.
24	Right! I know what I'll do!
25	Next time I might see if I can sweeten\nthe deal for her with a few tasty treats.\nThat might balance out the price issue!
26	Thank you so much. You really helped\nme out.
27	I'll be sure to tell Moui how helpful you\nwere.
qst003602_ms.json
1	Mopopo not working right now. But\nwhat is friend's business?
2	Oh... This is about friend Feyla's\norder...
3	Things she order right here.
4	But Mopopo not going to deliver.
5	Since Dughall go, not allowed to\ncharge extra fees for transporting\ngoods to Gormott.
6	Militia Corps really quite strict.
7	Once, Mopopo could make megafortune\njust by making delivery to Gormott.
8	But not now. So Mopopo cannot be\nbothered.
9	Did Feyla ask friend to come here?
10	Are you going back to place where\nFeyla is?
11	OK. This how to fix.
12	Friend can take goods to Gormott\ninstead of Mopopo.
13	Mopopo might not be working right\nnow, but head is still working. Pretty\nimpressive.
14	Mopopo actually quite sad not to do\nnormal route. Usually always eat Tasty\nSausage when making delivery there.
15	But no! Mopopo not do work\nfor such meager pay.
16	Mopopo might take further orders\nfrom Feyla though, if price is right.\nPlease tell to Feyla.
17	OK. Mopopo leave it to you.
18	Tasty Sausage...\nGormotti Honeytea...\nRuska Dumplings...
19	Mopopo too lazy to move for scant\nreward. But still hanker after Gormott\ncuisine...
20	If only some tasty treats would fall out\nof sky...

9	In the meantime, I need your help with\nmaterials for stringing the wire back up.

4	Why not listen to the fiddle-faddle...\nUh... I mean, the pittle-pattle. *sigh*\nNo.
5	Uh, anyway...\nPeople gossip a lot, so\nwhy don't you ask around!
6	Yeah! Make sure you don't\nmiss anything!
7	All right on the info collectin' front?\nIt's your civic duty to help catch the\ncriminal!
8	Say, d'you know what a civic duty is?\nArdainian soldiers used to say it a lot.
9	Those fellas think they're so great\nusing all those big words!
10	Whuh?!\nYou cracked the case?
11	Well? Don't keep it to yourself!\nSpill it!
12	So it was Tirkin what did it,\nwith a bow! Whoa!
13	Old man Natheus made that wire\nextra-strong, so it's kinda incredible\na bow would do it in!
14	Awesome job, everyone!\nI'll let Chief Eyvan know that the case\nis done and dusted!

3	I'll bet anything that someone took\na big sword, broke the crane with it,\nthen hid it there! Oh my days, so scary!
4	And now of all times, the Ardainian\nsoldiers just sit around? Disgraceful!
5	That Mor Ardain lot say they're here\nto protect Gormott... What a load of\nguff! They haven't protected me once!
6	That's like my husband, promising on\nour wedding day he'd tell me he loves\nme every morning...

3	Well, now that you mention it...
4	The other night, a unit returning\nfrom patrol found itself under attack\nfrom unknown assailants.
5	Thankfully, they came out of it with\nonly a few scratches.
6	But whoever the attackers were,\nthey seemed to be quite the skilled\nmarksmen.
7	Thanks to the efforts of Mor Ardain,\nGormott is largely peaceful. That was\nthe only disturbance I can recall...
8	To think they would use bows...\nPrimitive, but I guess it keeps the\nexpenses down...
9	I take my unit's budget very seriously,\ntoo! ...Sometimes it's harder than\nguard duty, let me tell you...

4	Well, it was a while ago now that you\ncould find them here. Lately I hear\nthey haven't been showing up at all.
5	Either there's none left or the Cloud\nSea's current's changed.
6	Anyhow, it's a prized item on the\nmarket right now. You'll be hard\npressed to find them anywhere.

13	All right, deal's a deal!
14	According to the reports, there are\nthree Revenge Tirkin to deal with.
15	Report back to me when you're done\nwith the mission. I'll give you the\nFilament Globe as a reward.
qst004102_ms.json
1	Go straight from Torigoth till you see\nTwin Trunks Hill. The Tirkin Turf is on\ntop of that tree there.
2	They've built some impressive\nstructures, so you'll know when\nyou're there.
3	Made it back in one piece, eh?
4	Mind telling me how the\nRevenge Tirkin launched\ntheir attacks?
5	I know, I know. But I've got to give\nmy superior some kind of report to\nkeep them happy.
6	Whew. Sounds like a rough bunch\nindeed.
7	That info'll come in very handy if they\never attack us again.
8	Thanks for that. Here's your reward,\nas promised: one Filament Globe!
9	Be seeing you!

3	That does it. After I get rid of you guys,\nI'm taking him down next!
qst005201_ms.json
1	The beast-form Blade's Driver?\nYou won't find him here.
2	He lets his Blade, Akatsuki, relay all\nhis orders. Never shows his own face.
3	His orders always produce results,\nbut I suppose he made a mistake\nthis time letting you go.
4	No matter, though...\nI'll clean up the mess he left behind!

1	I guess just blind guessing isn't\ngoing to get us very far...
2	Maybe if we tried it enough times\nwe'd hit on a solution eventually,\nbut it would take quite a while.
3	Yeah, that doesn't sound like much fun.
4	If the key to this tablet lies anywhere,\nit will probably be in some kind of\nancient tome.
5	That would make sense.\nPerhaps it would be quicker if we\nfound the appropriate texts first.
6	Could I ask for a bit of help from\nthe mercenaries, too?
7	Of course! Let's find whatever clues\nwe can to unlock this tablet's mystery!
qst005602_ms.json
1	Excuse me! Could I ask you something?
2	Yes yes? What big voice for?
3	I heard that you might have an ancient\ntome that mentions something about\nan ancient tablet.
4	Could I have a look at it?
5	Girogi have many tomes like that.
6	Need more information about\ntablet you interested in.
7	Well, it's transparent, really thin,\nand floats in the air.
8	...You sure that really tablet?
9	Of course! It's clearly packed full\nof ancient information!
10	Thin and floating in air...?\nAhh!
11	Girogi do remember seeing picture\nlike that in tome!
12	Perfect! Could we take a look at it?
13	...10,000G.
14	You're charging us just to\nlook at it?
15	Tome was not easy to get hands on.\nVery valuable item!
16	If not willing to pay, Girogi suggest\nfriends leave.
17	Well, I guess it was a bit naive of us to\nexpect you to show us such a valuable\ntext for free. Rex, what do you think?
18	Whaaaaa?!
19	Friends bring money this time?
20	Pay 10,000G?
21	Always pleasure doing business!\nHere is tome you asked for.\nLook all you like!
22	Hmm... This definitely seems to be a\npicture of the tablet we found.
23	It's just covered in weird writing,\nthough. How are we meant to read\nany of this?
24	Don't worry, I can take care of that!
25	What does it say?
26	...It looks like this is an explanation\nof how that tablet works.
27	The text's pretty faded, so there are\nquite a few bits I can't read...
28	But there was a bit that said\n"XE36". It seemed to be part\nof the tablet's name.
29	The tablet has a name?\nThat's pretty weird.
30	Hang on, Adenine!\nWhat if that isn't a name...
31	Ohhh!
32	It could be part of the 12-character\ncode we're looking for!
33	Nice work, Adenine!
34	I don't have that kind of money...
35	Whaaaat?!
36	Wait right here, OK?\nWe'll fetch the money in a jiffy!
37	I'm counting on you, Rex!
38	Why meeeee?!
39	Pay
40	Don't pay
qst005603_ms.json
1	Hi there!
2	What you people want?\nAfter something in particular?
3	We're investigating a certain\nancient tablet.
4	Ancient tablet?
5	Yep. It's transparent, really thin,\nand floats in the air.
6	Hmmm... Sound very unusual.
7	Me has heard of ancient technology\nto make words and pictures float in air.
8	Maybe this tablet related to\nthat technology.
9	We heard you might have an ancient\ntome related to that tablet. Is it true?
10	Me does have tome from that era.
11	Might contain information about\nstrange tablet.
12	Friends want to read tome?
13	Really? You'd let us?!
14	Yes yes. Friends need to decipher\ntome by selves, though.
15	How was it, Adenine?
16	It did seem like the text was about\nthe right kind of ancient technology.
17	But there wasn't much about that\ntablet in particular...
18	All I could find was a weird name\nthat said "E46S"...
19	You don't think that's...
20	Of course! It must be part of\nthe twelve-character code!
21	Why the tome can't just list the\nwhole code in one go, I don't know...\nBut at least it's progress.
22	Yep! It's all thanks to you guys!
qst005604_ms.json
1	Hi, I'd like to take out an ancient tome\nabout ancient floating tablets.
2	Floating tablets?
3	Yeah, there's this weird thin tablet\nthat floats in the air. We need to\nknow more about it.
4	Well, we do have one book that\nmight be relevant to your needs...
5	The only thing is, nobody has ever\nbeen able to read it.
6	Don't worry! I should be\nable to handle that!
7	So? What'd it say?
8	Well...if I'm honest, it was pretty\ndifficult. I could only decipher\nbits and pieces.
9	But I managed to get a string of\ncharacters that seemed relevant!\nIt said "19A3".
10	I'm sure this has to be part of the\n12-character code we're looking for.
11	If you found out that much,\nthat's all that matters.
12	Yep. We're getting closer to the day\nwhen we unlock that tablet's secrets!
qst005801_ms.json
1	Hey, take a look at this Brief History\nof Alrest book. This bit here.
2	It says there used to be a kingdom\non the Isle of Sleeping Remains in\nLeftheria.
3	Apparently it was destroyed by a\nnatural disaster or something.
4	Huh, really?
5	Come now, Rex...\nAre you not even familiar with the\nhistory of your own homeland?
6	D-don't look at me like that!
7	Why would I know about some old\nkingdom? It doesn't have much to\ndo with salvaging...
8	You didn't know anything about\nit either, right, Gramps?
9	Hmm? I'll have you know there are\nvery few things I am not aware of.
10	That said, I cannot remember\nhearing of such a kingdom...
11	Maybe this happen even before\nGramps was born?
12	An ancient kingdom...?\nI see...
13	Was this kingdom a wondrous place?
14	Mmmmm... The book doesn't go\ninto that much detail.
15	Then let us travel to the Isle of Sleeping\nRemains! Perchance it may trigger\nsome long-buried memory within me.
qst005802_ms.json
1	So this is the Isle of Sleeping Remains\nof which those writings told...
2	Was there really a kingdom here?
3	It's hard to believe when the place\nlooks so...empty.
4	You think it was overrun by monsters\nor something, and they just...y'know,\ncrushed everything?
5	It is a possibility...\nLet us dig!
6	Dig?
7	Though the buildings on the surface\nmay be destroyed, some traces would\nsurely be left beneath the ground.
8	Now, let us unearth those secrets!
9	Dagas, I am afraid this may not be\na realistic plan. Apart from anything,\nit would take far too much time.
10	This is an order from your king.\nCommence digging at once!
11	Dagas not listening even little bit...
12	Come on, guys. We've come this far.
13	Let's at least try to do as Dagas asks.
14	Once you take on a job,\nyou see it through!
15	Not another one of your\nSalvager's Code thingies...
16	But all right, let's see if we can\ndo this thing.
qst005803_ms.json
1	All this digging, and still not a single\nsign of anything...
2	Was there really ever a kingdom\nhere in Leftheria?
3	It is a bit of a cramped place for one.
4	Perhaps the bulk of this kingdom has\nsunk into the Cloud Sea. If so, it may\nbe impossible for anyone to find.
5	...I have it. I see it all now!
6	What? Did you remember something?
7	The information that book provided\nwas nothing but a pack of lies!
8	Meh-meh?!
9	Tora and friends played for fools\nby lying book?!
10	Though it pains me to admit it,\nit is the only explanation.
11	I was a fool to come all this way with\nno proof that the writings were true.
12	But there is no use in worrying\nabout that which is past!
13	We must cast this failure aside\nand seek a different clue!
qst005901_ms.json
1	Hey, Nia.\nWhat d'you think of this?
2	What've you found now?
3	Gormott was once a prosperous\nrepublic...
4	Yeah, I've heard about that before.
5	Old Gormott was formed from a\nbunch of different clans joining up\nand governing together, right?
6	A proud republic, bringing together\ndiverse clans under a single banner?
7	I see, I see... It is all clear to me now!\nSurely I was the King of Gormott!
8	Well, I don't know too much about it,\nbut if you ask the Chief of Torigoth,\nyou might be able to find out more.
9	Hang on...does a republic even\nhave a king? It doesn't, right?
10	Come, my retainers!
11	We must find this Chief of Torigoth\nand find out the truth of this tale!
12	He's not even listening...
qst005903_ms.json
1	My apologies for calling upon you so\nsuddenly. I am most grateful to be\ngranted so swift an audience.
2	My name is Dagas. A king bereft of\nmemories, searching the world over\nfor clues to his lost throne.
3	From you, esteemed Chief, I would hear\nof the noble Republic that prospered\nhere many centuries ago.
4	If it would not be too much trouble,\nwould you grant us your counsel?
5	Wow...\nIt's like he's a real noble.
6	Your gracious petition is most welcome,\nMr. Dagas. I am Edgar.
7	I am no king myself, but I would be\nglad to reward your courtesy with\nwhat information I possess.
8	...And so as you see, I am afraid\nI must disappoint you.
9	I know of no records indicating that\na king such as yourself ever ruled\nhere in Gormott.
10	I am sorry I could not provide you with\nmore positive news after you traveled\nall this way to visit.
11	That is quite all right, good sir.\nThank you for the detailed explanation.
12	It is a shame that I could not find my\nold kingdom here, but your words have\nnonetheless taught me much.
13	Now, we must away to pursue\nother endeavors. Farewell!
14	I hope you are able to find your\nlost kingdom someday.
15	Well, that was a shame, huh, Dagas.
16	Hahahah!
17	Well, my dear retainers, it seems\nyou were a little hasty this time.
18	To think you expected to find a king\nin a republic, of all places!
19	But anyone can make a mistake.\nIt is nothing to be ashamed of.
20	Uh, I'm pretty sure you're the one\nwho got mixed up.
21	Now come, my retainers!\nWe must find a more valuable clue!
22	Aaaand he's not listening again.
qst006001_ms.json
1	Ah, is this a stone tablet?\nIt does not seem all that old.
2	The people of Tantal once made their\ndwellings among the Genbu Drifts.
3	Therein lay...
4	"Therein lay"...? Therein lay what?
5	I'm afraid that sentence has\nno conclusion.
6	No conclusion?\nWhat do you mean?
7	A piece of the stone tablet is missing,\nso the sentence is unfinished.
8	Then if we want to know the full story,\nwe have to find the missing piece?
9	Apparently the proprietor found this\ntablet around the Genbu Drifts area.
10	What d'you think, Dagas?
11	Need you even ask?
12	We must search far and wide for\nas many missing pieces as it takes!
13	And then of course we will return here\nto examine the completed tablet.\nIs that understood, my retainers?
14	Haha... As you wish, Your Majesty.
qst006002_ms.json
1	Well? Is the tablet restored?
2	Yep... The four pieces\ntogether perfectly.
3	Let's have a looksee then...
4	"Therein lay a mighty lake and a temple\nhousing technology of the ancients."
5	"But with the Titan's decline, dangerous\nmonsters began to roam these drifts."
6	"To avoid these monsters, the people\nmade use of the land's great pillars to\nbuild new dwellings."
7	"Yet now, as the snows grow stronger\nand deeper, we are forced to retreat\nstill further to ever higher ground."
8	"If we do not solve this problem soon,\nall of Tantal may become unlivable..."
9	...That is all it says?
10	That's your lot. Looks like some\nkind of investigation report.
11	Then this line of enquiry\nwas a dead end...
12	Don't look so down, Dagas!
13	Hmph. You need not coddle me.
14	Instead of wasting time here, we\nshould search for another lead!
qst006003_ms.json
1	Well? Is the tablet restored?
qst006004_ms.json
1	Well? Is the tablet restored?
qst006005_ms.json
1	Well? Is the tablet restored?
qst006101_ms.json
1	Hmm? This book...
2	It's about a "Mystery Continent"...\nLooks like some kind of fairy tale.
3	"Long ago, there was a mystical\nkingdom in a mysterious continent."
4	A mysterious continent...a mystical\nkingdom... I like the sound of all this.\nThey sound fitting for my personage.
5	"But this mysterious continent was\ndestroyed in a single night."
6	What?! A single night?!\nCan that be possible?
7	"That mysterious continent of which\nnobody knows..."
8	"Its secrets are inscribed on the\nDalnes Stone in Temperantia."
9	And that's your lot.
10	Temperantia... I see.
11	Hold on. You're not going to just\nbelieve this fairy tale, are you?
12	You fool! Fairy tales too are legitimate\nrecords of the past!
13	This message was left for a reason.\nIt is only right that we investigate!
14	Now come, my retainers.\nWe head for Temperantia!
qst006102_ms.json
1	This is no place for civilians.\nThis area is under military investigation.
2	The stele is still being examined. We\ncan't have any civilians mucking about\nwith it. It might fall to bits!
3	Oh, my... Are you a royal personage?!\nWell, I'm sure you'd know how to\nhandle a fine thing like that...
4	Please, examine it to your heart's\ncontent, your Royalness!\n
5	You look suspicious. Get lost!
qst006103_ms.json
1	So this is the Dalnes Stone?
2	Rex, is there something written\non it over there?
3	Allow me to examine the Stone.
4	Let's see, now...
5	The Kingdom's name is...Regideria.
6	It lies upon a mysterious Titan that\nmoves about freely, never exposing\nitself to human eyes.
7	But in this place, Regideria sank in a\nsingle night, together with its people...
8	What else does it say?
9	The inscription ends here.
10	If the whole country sank beneath the\nclouds, there's not much we can do...
11	Hah. You are too quick to give up.\nI will not allow our quest to end here!
12	We know where this kingdom met\nits end. We may be able to salvage\nsome manner of relic from it!
13	You've got to be kidding me.\nJust how long do you think this\nplace has been down there?
14	Relics of a long-lost kingdom...\nI like the sound of that!
15	Oh, for the...\nNow you've got Rex started too?!
16	Come, my retainers.\nLet us get to the bottom of this tale!
qst006104_ms.json
1	Hey, could this be...\na stone tablet from Regideria?
2	Truly you are a fine salvager, Rex!
3	Huh, pretty weird shape for a tablet.\nWhat's it say?
4	Let's have a go at reading it, shall we?
5	"Due to the appearance of the\nterrible Arrogant Behemoth..."
6	"The Kingdom of Regideria perished\nin a single night, Titan and all."
7	This Arrogant Behemoth must be a\npretty damn terrifying monster.
8	...
9	Is something the matter, Dagas?
10	Accursed beast...\nHow dare you harm my kingdom...
11	My retainers! We must find this fell\nbeast that destroyed my homeland!
12	Whoa there, dude. We're talking about\nsomething that happened centuries ago.\nWho says the monster's still even alive?
13	Still, if we know its name, we might be\nable to track it down through stories\npassed down in various regions...
14	I think this sounds like a mercenary job.
15	Agreed. That will be the most\nefficient way to conduct such a\nlarge-scale investigation.
16	Very well.\nThen let us begin!
qst006105_ms.json
1	Oh, my... Are you a royal personage?!\nMy sincerest apologies.\nPlease, it's right here!
qst006106_ms.json
1	My sincerest apologies.\nPlease, look all you want!
qst006501_ms.json
1	A Whelzaman Cookie, for me?\nSorry, I don't feel like one right now...
2	That nasty Jankie stole my\nfavorite treasure from me...
3	Without my treasure, I don't\nfeel like eating anything!
4	Th-thanks! I think Jankie was heading\nover towards Loska's Gap.
5	You'll get my treasure back\nfrom Jankie, right?
6	I think Jankie was heading\nover towards Loska's Gap.
7	Ahhh! It's my treasure!\nThank you!
8	Now I might have the appetite for\none of those Whelzaman Cookies!
9	Thanks so much, really!
10	When I grow up, I wanna marry\na girl who makes the BEST\nWhelzaman Cookies.
qst006502_ms.json
1	You're Jankie, right?\nGive back the treasure that\nyou stole from Jammie!
2	What's your problem, old lady?!
3	O...old lady...?!
4	Don't you pay him any mind.\nHe's only a brat.
5	Shaddup, you big creep!\nI hope all your hair falls out!
6	Why, you little... Who d'you think\nyou're calling a creep?! Oh, you're\nso in for it now!
7	ANYWAY!\nStealing from people is bad!\nDo you want to be a common thief?!
8	Shaddup!
9	If you're really not going to give it back,\nyou leave me no choice.
10	I will be forced to unleash my\nEye of Shining Justice!
11	Say what?
12	E...Eye of Shining what?!
13	If I remove this eyepatch, my divine eye\nwill seek out any bad little boys and\nseal them away, never to return!
14	H-hah! As if I'm going to believe\na ridiculous lie like that!
15	If you're so sure I'm lying, shall we\nfind out? You may not live to regret it...
16	A...all right, fine!\nI'll give them back! You satisfied?!
17	Now don't go stealing from people\nany more, do you hear?
18	The Eye of Shining Justice always\nknows where to find you.
19	All right, already...\nI won't steal stuff, I promise...
20	Damn. Your Eye of Shining Justice\nis even cooler than mine...
qst006503_ms.json
1	I-I'm not gonna steal anything!\nSo keep that Eye of Shining Justice\nunder wraps, you hear?!
qst006601_ms.json
1	I haven't eaten a proper meal in\nfour whole days!
2	Surely you can spare a little grub\nfor poor old me?!
3	I...I'm sorry...
4	We worked hard to get our hands\non these rations ourselves!
5	I can't just hand them over!
6	What did you say?! That does it,\nI'm taking them by force-
7	Trying to assault an unarmed woman?\nHave you no shame?!
8	Wha-?! Who are you guys?!
9	You're bothering these people.\nIf you leave quietly, we won't hurt you.
10	Wh-what do you know about my\ntroubles?! Don't talk like you're\noh so superior!
11	Step back, you two.\nThis won't take long.
12	A-all right!
qst006602_ms.json
1	I can't part with these rations!\nMy Terry needs them!
qst006603_ms.json
1	Thank you so much!\nI'll never forget the debt I owe you!
qst006604_ms.json
1	We lined up to get the rations\nlike we're supposed to...
2	Why would that nasty guy try to\ntake them? That's not fair...
qst006605_ms.json
1	Thanks for taking care of\nthat scary man!
2	You've got a Whelzaman Cookie\nfor me, too?! Wow, thanks!

1	Oh! Greetings!
2	Do you remember me, perhaps?\nIt's Alisdeigh. That business with the\nancient Nopon murals?
3	Since you got that key, I've been\nlooking at the other evidence of the\nancient Nopon in this place.
4	You know...whether the hero's treasure\nfrom the mural actually existed or not...
5	But it seems you've just found it!
6	So how did you get here?
7	That key? In the door of Argentum?
8	Ah, of course... I had heard that there\nused to be a Nopon base of activities\nhere in the ancient period, yes...
9	So no wonder that would be where\nthe answer is to be found!
10	Anyhow, what was this treasure that\nyou found?
11	Hmmm... Money...a book...\nTh-this is...
12	This is the logbook of the legendary\npirate, Captain Nopopon!
13	Of course, I'm anxious to see what it\ncontains... But may I ask, were you sent\nhere by someone else, perhaps?
14	It wouldn't benefit me to stick\nmy nose into incomplete research.
15	I really think I ought to just wait for\nthe study to be published.

7	We only find this chest, but\nnobody can open!
8	Looked for key, but could not find.\nNo switch on chest either...
9	Niranira is sure this is important\nevidence against Bana, but without\nknowing insides, it is useless.
10	Friends will help Niranira open it?\nThank you!

qst100605_ms.json

4	We will wield power of law and extract\ninformation about how to open chest!
5	But Bana not listen to what\nNiranira has to say.
6	Has no respect for Niranira at all!\nHrrr grrr!
7	Niranira can count on friends then?
8	Sorry Niranira burden you with\nicky-yucky task.
9	Bana sentenced to hard labor\non treadmill.
10	He not allowed to talk long,\nso keep it short!
11	It take much guile to trick Bana\ninto revealing secret of chest!
12	Bana tell you how to open chest?
13	Ether Bottle,\nFilament Globe,\nKey-Shaped Lever...
14	Insert those three things to open chest?\nThat sound complicated!
15	Names familiar, but Niranira have\nno idea where to find them.
16	Sorry for constant requests!\nThank you for taking care!
17	Please bring Ether Bottle,\nFilament Globe, and\nKey-Shaped Lever.

3	Meh-meh-meh-meh!\nWhy nobody hear of\nPyrithium Trade Guild?!
4	Pyrithium Trade Guild one of\neleven Nopon trade guilds.

22	In Central Exchange area of Argentum\nTrade Guild, is lots of stacked crates.\nOne Doubloon found on top there!
23	There are eleven Nopon Doubloons\nin total! Friends gather every last one\nand come back here, meh!
24	Until then, Nunui take deep dive into\nbusiness wisdom of Chairman Bana.
25	What is saying? "Know thy competitor"?
qst100702_ms.json

11	"the sum of one million G lent to me by\nthe Pyrithium Trade Guild Chairman."
12	...That number make mind boggle...\nWho get themself in this kind of debt?!
13	"So help me the Architect.\n Signed: Azurda"
14	Azurda?\nName sound familiar...
15	Oh-ho, who knew that records of\nthat loan would remain?!
16	I was younger back then...\nThough I did look older, admittedly...
17	Gramps, what the heck did you need\na loan for?!
18	Well, you see, that's...\nI may have been a little hard up...
19	Meh? The little creature is Azurda?
20	Indeed, I am Azurda!\nThe reasons why I reverted to infancy\nare perhaps too long to get into now...
21	Ah!!!\nNunui remember now!
22	When I still littlepon,\nGrannypon tell me this\nfairy-tale...
23	About the time she lend money to\nhuge Titan named Azurda!
24	So it not a fairy-tale after all!
25	Fairy-tales about money-lending?\nHaha, that's just like the\nPyrithium Trade Guild I knew!
26	This isn't the time for reminiscing,\nGramps!
27	Please tell me you've\nreturned the money?
28	...I did not.
29	Of course you didn't...
30	The treasures we just uncover\nare collateral of Azurda.
31	Nunui cannot very well go\nahead and liquidate asset...\nWould be bad form.
32	Will dream of restoring\nPyrithium Trade Guild die here...?
33	Gramps.
34	Y-yes?
35	You borrowed the money because you\nreally needed it, right?
36	O-of course!\nWould I pawn all these precious\ntreasures for no good reason?!
37	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]I don't think I can tell them it was\nto keep my girlfriend happy...
38	...Here's what we do.
39	Nunui, I'll pay back the money.
40	Y-you will, Rex?\nBut it's a million gold!
41	We could just relinquish the treasure\nand call it a day...
42	Nope! Line seven of the Salvager Code\nclearly stipulates, "Never leave a debt\nunpaid"!
43	Rex...
44	Such wonderful code!
45	Then it settled!\nFriends pay back the\nmillion G friends owe!
46	We will for sure!\nRight, Gramps?
47	Yes, Rex...\nThank you, Rex...
48	Then friends just let Nunui know\nwhen friends have the money.
49	Until then, Nunui will continue to study\nwisdom of Bana. I feel I on verge of\nreal breakthrough!

2	Now I tear up I.O.U. paper...\nAnd hand over treasures!
3	Rex...\nI'm sorry for the bother.
4	Chill out, Gramps.
5	You know I've got your back! I don't\neven mind if you used the cash on\npresents for your girlfriend!
6	You understand, then?!\nYes, she was something of a\nmaterial girl... It was a difficult time.
7	After the break-up, I never managed to\nmeet anyone new, so I've been single\nfor over a century now...
8	...I was just trying to be funny...
9	Oh.\nS-sorry, maybe that was\ntoo much information...
10	Nunui offer commiserations,\nbut am frankly not overly interested.
11	More importantly for Nunui,\ncan now use capital of one million G\nto revive Pyrithium Trade Guild!
12	Step one, as learned from wisdom of\nBana, is employ adorable attendants!\nWill get on it right away!
13	Toodle-pip!

1	Hey there! You lot look like you're well\nused to the open road!
2	And then you have me...
3	Ah, where are my manners!\nCapher's the name. I'm a traveler of\nsorts, too.
4	A certain doctor from Gormott asked us\nto source him some Healing Herb. So\nme and my pal Cherlie said we'd oblige.
5	We're both strangers here in Gormott.\nWe're not too sure where to look for\nmedicinal herbs in these parts.
6	While we were searching, somehow\nCherlie managed to wander off all\nthe way over there.
7	I've been calling out for ages, but with\nno response.
8	It's a wee bit embarrassing, but I'm no\ngood at clambering up things.
9	By the time I get to where she is, she'll\nprobably have moved off somewhere\nelse.
10	Really? Aye, that's a great help to me!
11	I can see Cherlie from here, so if she\nmoves, I'll give you a shout.
12	Oh, rats! She's no good at fighting\neither, but she's gone and hared off...
13	And left me all by myself...
14	Oh! Sorry!
15	Could you go and tell Cherlie to come\nback here? Cheers!
qst100802_ms.json

1	Hey!\nCan you hear me?
2	Cherlie's on top of that waterfall.
3	Ah, so sorry to ask you to go to all this\nbother! Thanks a bunch!

qst100806_ms.json
1	Och, it's not often you bump into\nsomeone in a place like this, is it,\nCapher?! Where'd he go...?
2	Ah, I was so carried away looking for\nthat Healing Herb, I forgot all about\nCapher.
3	If he was so worried about me, I don't\nknow why he didn't just come looking\nfor me himself.
4	It's not like he can't handle himself...
5	Ah, I get it!\nI suppose he's a bit too careful\nto risk climbing!
6	He's the opposite of me, I guess.\nOh!
7	The Healing Herb! It's in that little\npatch there!
8	This Healing Herb's a delicate wee\nfellow. He sprouts in the morning, but\nby the evening, he's withered away.
9	Now, I know what you're thinking.\n"Why don't you just get up early and\npick the herb then," right?
10	But the nasty thing is, that's\nwhen monsters show up to\nscoff 'em all down.
11	I'm not much of a fighter...\nWe need Capher over here...
12	No point waiting for him though, since\nhe asked you guys to come get me.
13	Fighting alone's not great, but needs\nmust...
14	You'll go and fetch it for me?
15	But I didn't come all this way not to\nfetch it myself...
16	Ah, maybe I can just slip past\nand grab the Healing Herb without\nhaving to fight...
17	Ugh!
18	If a team of Drivers and their\nimpressive Blades are warning me\noff...
19	I guess I'd better listen...\nOK, I'd only slow you down, so\nI'll just head back.
20	But don't forget the Healing Herb, OK?
qst100807_ms.json
1	You can only get the Healing Herb\nin the morning.
2	Or did you want me to go along\nand get it with you?
3	So, you guys don't think I can handle\ndangerous places either, huh?
4	Thanks for getting it...
qst100808_ms.json
1	Hey, why didn't you come\nand help me?
2	I thought we were buddies! That means\nyou're supposed to come and give me a\nhand if I'm in a tough spot!
3	B-but there was nothing I could do!
4	You know I'm scared of high places,\ncliffs, slippy surfaces! You know full\nwell!
5	If you're gonna wander off somewhere,\nyou need to check with me first! Did\nyou think of that?
6	You could have just got a grip and\ncome over to help! Did that occur to\nyou?
7	Honestly, Capher! We're out here in\nsearch of adventure! We'll never have\nany if you're scared of everything!
8	Why...you...
9	How shall we get them to calm down?
10	Tell them they complement each other.
11	Tell them to stop being so silly.
12	We compensate for each other's\nshortcomings?
13	Hmmm. Well, I'm terrible at searching\nfor stuff, but I'm good in a fight, that's\nfor sure.
14	Cherlie blazes a trail up ahead and\nfinds new places that I've never seen,\nbut she waits for me.
15	I mean, I'm a little slow...but I do my\nbest to catch up.
16	Capher...
17	I guess you're right. We did promise\neach other that we'd find amazing\nplaces together...
18	OK! I'll leave the rear guard to you!
19	And I'll scout ahead to look for the\nroutes with the safest footing!
20	If you lot hadn't have turned up, I\nreckon I'd have ended up as a\nmonster's lunch!
21	M-Monster? There were monsters when\nyou went to get the Healing Herb?
22	Yes...there were...
23	So if these people hadn't helped you,\nyou'd have... Gulp!
24	I'm sorry, Capher... I guess I was a little\nthoughtless.
25	You're just a bit too gung-ho.\nAnd I'm too much of a scaredy-cat.
26	Maybe we should tell each other when\nour shortcomings start to be a problem!
27	Thanks for helping us, guys.
28	Sorry for putting you to all that bother.
29	Thanks for helping me get that\nHealing Herb! The doctor will be\nreally grateful!
30	It's been a wake-up call for us, as well.\nI think we're going to make an effort to\ncooperate more from now on.
31	Here, we can't let you go without\ngiving you a little something.
32	Well, mind how you go!

1	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Whoaaa!\nI almost jumped out of my skin!
2	Oh! Are those...Blades?!\nSorry to bother you, but...
3	You wouldn't happen to have any\nBlades who can melt ice, would you?
4	My Driver, Therida, is all\nfrozen up in ice. Don't ask.
5	I can't fix it myself, so I've been looking\nfor someone who can.
6	I mean, it's only thanks to Therida that\nI'm alive.
7	It's been a long journey... I can't\nbelieve it's been five years since\nI left Tantal already.
8	I came here to Gormott because\nI heard there were some Blades\nwith really awesome flame power.
9	But no luck so far. What's worse, I'm\nstarting to feel Therida's power waning.\nI'm really worried.
10	I don't know how to help her!
11	Could you be the flame-wielding\nBlade that I've been searching for\nall this time?
12	Have I found you at last?
13	Please! Please do what you can to help\nTherida!
14	She's at Declessa Altar Hill, near the\ncrevice in the Tantalese snow plain.
15	I'm sorry, I'd really like to show you the\nway myself.
16	But being this far away from Therida,\nwell, it makes me very weak.
17	I'll be sure to catch you up though.\nPlease, help her as quickly as you\ncan!

2	Therida's alive! Alive, I tell you!
3	Come on, Therida. Get up.\nPlease, Therida!\nOh, what am I going to...
4	Thanks...\nHang on though...what was\nmeant to be the herb for...?
5	That's it! Amethyst Vanilla!
6	I think Therida once told me\nyou could use Amethyst Vanilla\nto bring someone round!
7	Maybe if you brought me some\nAmethyst Vanilla...
8	Please stay with us, Therida!
qst100903_ms.json
1	Therida really knows a lot about fruits,\nflowers and trees. Taught me all about\nthem, in fact.
2	Vinegar Leaf's a good pesticide...\nBreath Charcoal, that's good kindling.\nIt's Amethyst Vanilla for waking up.
3	If I just had some Amethyst Vanilla,\nTherida would be just fine...
qst100904_ms.json
1	OK, Therida... We've got the Amethyst\nVanilla now, so it's time to wake up...
2	Urgh... Heurgh!
3	Therida! Therida!\nIt's me, Llonya!
4	What... Where...?
5	Thank goodness you're all right,\nTherida! It's all thanks to these -
6	Llonya!\nPrepare for battle!
7	Therida?!
8	Can't you see the Drivers in front of us?\nThe battle's far from over!
9	Let's do this!
10	Therida, wait!\nJust listen, will you?
qst100905_ms.json
1	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Frozen in ice? For five years...?! No...\nIt can't be!
2	But... I remember a battle...\nWhat happened to the enemies?
3	After you got frozen, a bunch of\nGarlus came storming in here\nand beat them up.
4	Ah...I see...
5	Well, sorry for reacting like that...\nI think I got hold of the wrong end of\nthe stick...
6	I thought I was still fighting that battle...
7	Thanks, all of you.
8	Thanks to you, my memories of\nTherida are safe!
9	Therida... You should rest in Tantal for\na little while.
10	Anyone'd need to get their bearings\nafter being asleep for five years.
11	Kingdom of Tantal...
12	Tantal, eh... Hey, I wonder whatever\nhappened to its crazy Prince...\nWhat was his name?
13	He'd be 25 now... An eligible bachelor,\nI dare say!
14	Therida...
15	Did we wind up here because you\naccepted a job just because you were\nstar-struck?
16	Hmm... Maybe? Sorry, after five years\non ice, my memory's not so great...
17	Thanks, everyone!\nWell, see you around!
18	But, man, five years is nothing really!\nIf I'd stayed frozen for five hundred,\nimagine the crazy future I'd wake up to!
19	I bet everyone'd be wearing super-cool\nfuture clothes, and I'd become a star,\non account of my old-timey charm...
20	*sigh* It's nice Therida's back to her\nold self, at least. Still, we'd best go\nback to town for now.

1	So YOU did this?!\nYou're the one that broke the crane?
2	Oh, you didn't do it...?\nWell, gee... Sorry 'bout the accusation.
3	Oh, curious, are you?
4	That's our big important helper,\nthe crane... But right now the wire's\nout, so it's just taking up space.
5	At first I thought it just snapped from\nregular wear and tear, but actually it\nkeeps breaking.
6	I fixed it once, I fixed it again... No use.\nCome morning, it's broken again.
7	The number of times it's happened,\nit's hard to see it as an accident...\nTruth be told, I suspect foul play.
8	We gotta make up for the work we lose\nwith the wire being broken, but...
9	Well, without the crane, we're not\nmaking much headway...\nWhat's a guy to do?
10	What, really? Wow.\nYou're a lifesaver!
11	OK, well, there's two things you\ncan do for me.
12	First, help us fix the crane\nso we can use it again.
13	Natheus, the crane operator, is\nin charge of that part.
14	You should ask him for details.
15	The other thing is...finding the weasel\nwho keeps messing with the wire, and\nbringing them to justice!
16	You're on your own there, though.
17	Although... Pettle, our apprentice, is\npretty keen on finding the criminal,\nso maybe you can ask him?
18	You can find both of 'em by the crane.\nJust follow the outside wall, you can't\nmiss it.
19	A'ight, well, I'm countin' on ya!
20	Ask Natheus about fixing the crane.
21	The other thing would be to find\nwhoever cut the crane wire, but...
22	Well, ask young Pettle about that.\nWe're countin' on ya!
23	You did a great job with the crane\nrepairs! Thanks a bunch!
24	Oh, but I guess that's not everything.
25	Fixing the crane won't do much good\nif the criminal stays at large. You never\nknow when he might strike again!
26	Good luck!
27	Hey, Pettle told me everything!\nSo it was those Tirkin, eh?\nBloody Nora...
28	Oh, but I guess that's not everything.
29	We don't have to worry about the wire\ngetting cut again, but we still can't\nwork unless we fix the crane.
30	Good luck!
31	Hey! I heard from Natheus and Pettle!
32	Those must've been some real buff\nTirkin, to cut one of Natheus's own\nwires like that...
33	They'll probably make harder workers\nthan that good-for-nothing guard\nRahim, come to think of it...
34	Anyhow!\nYou took care of the offending Tirkin,\nand the crane is also now fixed!
35	The Saets Lumber Co. is saved,\nthanks to you! Here, I hope you'll\nlet us thank you properly!

2	All my furniture is made to order,\ny'see...
3	I use only the finest Gormotti lumber to\nmake our customers' furniture-related\ndreams come true!
4	...Hm, actually, I haven't seen you lot\naround here. Are you tourists?
5	Any chance you might've seen\nmy son Pawli on your way here?
6	Ah, OK... It's just that, normally he\nshould've come home by now...
7	I asked him to run an errand for me,\ny'see, and he's not back yet.
8	He's just a kid, so I can let him off with\na little meandering, but sometimes you\ncan't help but worry, y'know?
9	I tried negotiating some sort of\ndeadline extension with our Ardainian\nclient, but no dice.
10	Not only that, they even threatened to\nsue me for all I have if I don't make the\ndelivery... So I can't go looking myself.
11	People these days, talking about\npublic order so much that they forget\nbasic human decency...
12	Ah, beg pardon. There I go again,\nmouthing off at poor travelers... Please,\npay me no mind. I'm sure it'll be fine.
13	Oh? No, please, I couldn't\npossibly ask you to...
14	A-ah...\nWell... Thank you, then.
15	My boy Pawli was headed off to the\nWaytree, I believe.

5	There's just one hitch...
6	There's a type of wood I need\nto finish the furniture... It's called\nGormotti Walnut.
7	I was going to send Pawli to the\nNopon Camp to fetch it, but...
8	Well, his ankle's all swollen,\nand the doctor told him to\nlet it rest for a spell.
9	I even tried to ask some other folks,\nbut nobody seems to want anything to\ndo with those Nopon...
10	I guess I have no choice but to\nclose up shop and go myself...
11	Huh? No, come on, you already\nfound Pawli, I couldn't possibly...
12	Well... OK, if you're sure...\nThank you so much for everything.
13	You'll find the Nopon Camp on\nGaranti Plain, in the Waytree.
14	You'll need to pick up three bits of\nGormotti Walnut from a Nopon by\nthe name of Mokumoku.
15	Mokumoku knows how to lay his mitts\non good lumber, I'll give him that, but\nI wish he wasn't such a conniving little...
16	*sigh* Never mind.\nJust get those materials.
17	Thanks in advance for picking up the\nGormotti Walnut.
18	Mokumoku should be waiting for you\nat the Nopon Camp. That's in the\nWaytree on Garanti Plain. Got it?

1	Welcome, friends, to\nremote wilderness.
2	You want to make purchase?
3	Oh, you sent by Siorge?\nHe want the Gormotti Walnut?
4	Gormotti Walnut cost\n10,000G per bit.
5	Friends want three bits, yes?\nThat make 30,000G total.\nFriends give money and job done.
6	Friends surprised at pricey price?\nOho, but is no way around!
7	Gormotti Walnut grow with help from\nTitan. Friends know this, yes?
8	And also know that many Titans\ngrow weaker lately? Gormott also\nnot unaffected.
9	So material-grade Gormotti Walnut\nalso in limited supply.
10	Lumber get rarer, price get higher.\nSupply, demand... Is basically law!
11	If friends short on currency,\nwill graciously accept trade of\nMuscle Branch.
12	That also very precious, but admittedly\nhard to collect for Nopon...
13	So, what friends do?\nBuy with monies?\nOr trade for stuff?
14	What shall we do?
15	Pay gold
16	Trade goods
17	See again soon!
18	Siorge order three bits of Gormotti\nWalnut! Me still have enough!
19	Gormotti Walnut all sold out.
20	Maybe not possible to collect more\nuntil such time as Titan get better.
21	Business opposite of booming...\nMaybe time to up sticks and head\nfor different Titan.

2	Oh, you brought Melosian Honey!\nThanks!
3	I've been up to my neck in Militia\nCorps work. Just couldn't make the\ntime to go to Honeypot Grotto myself.
4	It's a risky undertaking with the\nmonsters and whatnot. I couldn't\nget anyone else to go either, and...
5	Oh, right!
6	You've proven to be a capable,\nnot to mention brave, lot!
7	Uh, it might be a bit much, jumping\nfrom honey straight into this, but...
8	How would you like to join the\nMilitia Corps?!
9	Sorry, I don't mean to put you\non the spot or anything...
10	It's just that, you know, with\nTorigoth's consul gone...
11	There's all sorts of small incidents\ncropping up all over the place.
12	For example...\nWe've got some Nopon illegally\nsquatting in our town...
13	I hear the townsfolk and Ardainian\nsoldiers at the Torigoth base have been\nbeefing with each other too.
14	The kids saw the adults squabbling, so\nnow they're following suit. That's\nanother issue that needs handling!
15	I also got word that Feyla's having big\nproblems getting deliveries since the\nconsul went.
16	I hate to just sit idly by while all this\ngoes on, but the Militia Corps are\nshort-handed as is.
17	Think you could help out?\nEvery little bit helps.
18	You will? Great!\nThanks!
19	If you can fix those four things that the\nmilitia told me about, that'd be great.
20	We've got a bunch of problems in this\ntown... For example, we've got some\nNopon illegally squatting here...
21	Once you've dealt with them all,\ncome and give me your report.
22	The Militia Corps are counting\non your cooperation!
23	My colleagues already\ntold me the news!
24	You did as well as I hoped!\nThanks! It's a big help.
25	No one's making excuses for old\nConsul Dughall, but I have to say,\nthe town was calmer back then...
26	I suppose he must've been working\nbehind the scenes to make it so.
27	That said, I really hope the next consul\nis more, shall we say, upstanding.
28	Or, well, if Mor Ardain up and left,\nthe problem would solve itself...
29	Ah, no, don't worry.\nThat's not your problem, really.
30	And anyway, consul or no consul,\nthis is our town.
31	We'll work our arses off to make sure\nwe can take care of it ourselves.
32	Here. It's just a small token\nof our appreciation.
33	You really helped us out.\nThanks again!

1	...I can't say I'm in the mood for\npleasantries.
2	We sent a vermin specialist with an\narmed escort to check on the Volff,\nbut they're late coming back. By days.
3	The critters have attacked villagers\nand Nopon traders, so we needed to\nlook into population control methods.
4	Two of the three guards we sent along\nwere Drivers. I didn't expect any issues\nwhen it came to combat, but, well...
5	We're stretched thin enough as is,\nso when two of our Drivers go\nmissing... Well, you can imagine.
6	Now the brass don't want to risk losing\neven more people if something were\nto happen to the rescue party...
7	Would you really? I hate to ask such\na dangerous job of strangers, but...\nHmm, what's this?
8	Oh, you've got Blades too!\nWell that's a stroke of luck!
9	Many Volff sightings have been\nmade near Varnax's Plunge. That's\nwhere the researcher was headed.
10	It's a big waterfall on the Titan's\nlower back.
11	I hope the four are unharmed...\nAnd best of luck to you.
12	The Volff research party was\nen route to the Varnax's Plunge area.

24	There's a scholar by the name of Tishk\nin the Beraf Industry Ward of the\nArdainian capital, Alba Cavanich.

2	Oh, hello.\nAre you biology enthusiasts?
3	Crops have been failing recently...\nThat's why I'm researching how to\nincrease agricultural...
4	Oh. He's...\nOh my...
5	When we were both young, we'd\noften team up to work in the field...
6	A Rampaging Sauros, huh...?
7	I'm just a humble biologist, but...
8	Hold on. There's one plant with\nproperties that may be of use here.
9	You see, a few years back I published\na research paper on Benoît Nuts and\nthe Rampaging Sauros.
10	You see, when a Rampaging Sauros\ningests Benoît Nuts...
11	it becomes greatly intoxicated,\nwhich impairs its motor skills.
12	In other words...\nIt's as if it's drunk.
13	You may be able to use this fact\nto more easily deal with even the most\nferocious of specimens.
14	Rampaging Sauros normally like to\nhide in their roosts, making them\nhard to track down.
15	But they do mark their territory\nby leaving claw marks around the area.
16	Place a Benoît Nut inside the marked\nterritory to lure the beast out. If it\ntakes the bait, it'll be all yours.
17	Benoît Nuts come from a rare plant\nwhich grows in Mor Ardain.
18	I remember hearing you can gather\nthem near Turbine Tower.
19	Best of luck on your search.
20	I wish I'd gone with them...\nI might have noticed the danger\nand warned them...
21	At least by advising you, I can put my\nmind at ease a little. Best of luck.
22	Benoît Nuts should be growing\nnear Turbine Tower.
23	Place one inside the beast's territory\nand wait for a good chance to strike.\nGot it?

15	Give it a Green Pollen Orb.

17	That's how they do it in Mor Ardain...
18	Come on, Rex. Umon asked us once\nbefore to rein a Titan in for him. What\nwas it you had to use?
19	Ah! It was a Green Pollen Orb, right?
20	There you go. That's the Nopon way\nof doing it. Cute, as you'd expect.
21	Exactly so!
22	Hehe... Nopon sure have some\ninteresting customs, huh?
23	It's a sight better than what those\nArdainians do, for sure!
24	You just picked that because you\nliked the sound of it, didn't you?

5	There's gotta be something in this\n"belly of the hermit"...
6	Hey, what's that supposed to mean?\nI'm a treasure hunter.

4	Wait... This looks a lot like my\ngrandpa's treasure!
5	I knew it... So that's what\nthose words meant!
6	The old man used to tell me this\nsaying about his treasure, see.
7	"Gather ye the pieces three and three\nand the hero's treasure ye shall reap."
8	So there are two sets of three pieces\nto my grandpa's treasure...six in total.
9	The other four have gotta be\nout there somewhere!
10	Hey, this is no time for admiration.\nWe should consider each other as\nrivals!
11	Let's see who can get to the other\nmurals first and solve the riddles...
12	See who gets their hands on the\nremaining four pieces...
13	Great! When we're done, we can\nall meet back here!
14	And then we can see what happens\nwhen all the pieces are united, and\nwe'll blow this mystery wide open!
15	It's on! See you around, mates!
16	
17	So you made it.
18	You don't need to say a word. You\nbeat me to it, didn't you.
19	My grandpa got this treasure from\nsalvaging.
20	Apparently it comes from the\nancient sunken Titan of Torna.
21	Yeah, he went deep. Deeper than most\nveteran salvagers feared to dive.\nAnd this is what he came back with.
22	But it took a lot out of him, the\npoor guy. He died not long after.
23	"Gather ye the pieces three and three\nand the hero's treasure ye shall reap."
24	That's what was written on the chest\nwith the piece he'd found.
25	He entrusted me to find the other\nfive pieces.
26	But I couldn't find any of them! What's\nthe point if I only have one?
27	Come on. Put your pieces on the line\nand we'll do battle one last time.
28	To the victor goes the spoils!
29	I've lived for this moment!\nMe and my grandpa both!

2	I thought I was pretty good.\nBut you guys are something else.
3	Go on, take it. My grandpa's treasure.\nMy treasure.
4	I said take it, dammit!
5	I wasn't good enough. I couldn't\nget all the pieces myself.
6	Hmm? Wait a sec... Show me those\npieces again, would you?
7	If you put each set of three together,\nit looks like they'll form two shapes...\na circle and a square.
8	"Gather ye the pieces three and three\nand the hero's treasure ye shall reap."
9	But it doesn't seem like these shapes\nthemselves are the treasure...
10	Well, whatever. From now on, the\ntreasure hunting's up to you.
11	Seek out that ancient Nopon treasure\nfor me, would you?
12	As for me, I'll just have to find myself\nsome new treasure to hunt for!

9	But Budada back home now!\nLook closely Budada's face!
10	Hmmmmm...
11	Budada was roundy-fatty,\nfluffy-puffy Nopon.
12	Lanky-gangly, filthy-mucky Nopon\nis not Budada!
13	You nasty Nopon, playing nasty trick on\ngrieving Possah!
14	Wah...Waaaaah!
15	Oooohhhhh... *sniff*\nBudada OK now...probably...
16	This all Budada's fault. Days of not\nmoving make Budada very thin.
17	But if Budada bring Blade Vahsah,\nPossah must understand.
18	Budada and Possah and Vahsah often\ntogether, very good buddies.
19	But Vahsah not here...
20	Where Vahsah go...?
21	Vahsah, Vahsah... Where are Vahsah?
22	Oh! Budada have idea!
23	Must have gone to city!\nTo Fonsa Myma!
24	Yes, Vahsah go there and search\npeople to help Budada!
25	Vahsah... You hear Budada...?\nIt OK now... Budada is here, here...
26	No good... Budada cannot reach\nto Vahsah's silly mind.
27	Thank you, friends.
28	Please escort Budada to Fonsa Myma\nso can find Vahsah!

4	Huh? Who are you?
5	Budada! Lost a bit of weight...
6	Nahhhh, you can't fool me!
7	Budada got defeated at Badfella's\nCave Fort. I saw him stop moving\nand everything...
8	Are you trying to taunt a poor guy\ngrieving over his dead Driver...?
9	Huh? And who might you be...?
10	You brought Budada here? Really?
11	...Well, I'll be damned. I can feel\nBudada's resonance! It really is you!
12	That just like silly old Vahsah...\nForget all about Budada.
13	Of course Budada not dead! Otherwise\nVahsah back to Core Crystal already!
14	Oh, right. Good point.\nWait, but then...aw, crap.
15	I've been spending a TON of money\nhere. Trying to enjoy my last moments,\ny'know. But if you're still alive...
16	Silly Vahsah should know better!\nEven if Vahsah lose memories,\nsomebody would remember debts!
17	Hahaha... You're probably right!
18	Yeah, um, I might be in a\nspot of trouble.
19	See that old lady?
20	I kinda promised her I wouldn't leave\ntown till I paid back everything I owe.
21	Why Vahsah make promise like that?!
22	Well, I thought you were done for, and\nI'd be disappearing soon, so...I figured\nit didn't matter what I did any more!
23	OK. No need to worry.\nEverything be OK.
24	Budada keep little bit of coin tucked\naway to cover silly mistakes by Vahsah.
25	Funds hidden safely in treasure box\nnear Funnystone Highway.
26	Da-yum.\nI knew I could count on my Driver!
27	Meh-heh-heh!
28	Driver and Blade must support each\nother. That golden rule of relationship.
29	Some folks say we're a bit of\na strange pair, though...
30	Please, friends... Will you help Budada\nget to little money hoard?
31	Thanks for helping Budada. I really\nappreciate it.
32	Vahsah, wait here quietly.\nNot spend money or make fuss!

7	Is that right?
8	Sorry for trouble 'cos by\nmy Blade Vahsah.
9	He will give back money you lend to\nhim now.
10	Oh! Came back with the money, didya?\nWell, that's just splendid.
11	Indeedy!
12	Here 5,000G. This cover silly\nVahsah's wild spending, yes?
13	5,000G? Oh, I'm sorry, dearie. That's a\nbit less than he owes.
14	Huh? Not enough? How much money\nVahsah borrow?
15	Ah, yeah... I guess I didn't mention\nthat part, did I?
16	Just add a couple zeroes, and we'll\nbe sorted. 500,000G to be precise.
17	Five wha-?!!! But that like...hundred\ntimes hundred times hundred times...\nBudada cannot even count!
18	You'll need to pay the whole lot off in\ncash, dearie.
19	Or, if you've got a decent lump of that\nTitan Quartz lying around, I'd accept\nthat as well! Hahah!
20	Titan Quartz? What's that?
21	Is very very precious jewel...\nSometimes found by salvage in\nArgentum, but only one time in million...
22	Budada not get hands on Titan Quartz,\nexcept in dream.
23	Well, if this Blade can't pay me back,\nthere is one other thing I'd accept.\nHis Core Crystal!
24	You'll get a pretty penny for a Core\nCrystal in somewhere like Mor Ardain.
25	But that not possible to give!
26	Vahsah only go back to Core Crystal\nwhen Budada dying!
27	You only take Core Crystal over\nBudada's dead body! Literally!
28	Don't turn your back on reality,\nBudada my pal. We're upstanding\npeople. We oughtta pay our debts.
29	And I guess in this case that\nmeans...uh, dying. Not a great\noutcome, I'll admit.
30	Well, well, well! These are some\ngenerous friends you've found\nyourselves here!
31	I don't care who pays me,\njust as long as someone does.
32	But remember, it's 500 grand,\nor a lump of Titan Quartz!\nI won't accept anything less!

1	...Odd.
2	Recently, Garfont mercenary missions\nhave been encountering unforeseen\ndifficulties.
3	Like finding subjugation targets already\nsubjugated, or harvest areas ravaged...
4	It very much looks like planned\ninterference.
5	Actually, the rise of these hindrances\nlargely coincides with the rise in\nour mercenaries' numbers...
6	Could it be that there are\nspies in our midst...?
7	I don't like that thought, but\nI must have certainty.
8	But discreetly...
9	You lot keep Vandham's will alive.\nI'm sure I can trust you with this...
10	Here's what we'll do.
11	I'll send you on a subjugation mission\nwith some new mercenary recruits.
12	You'll watch for signs of any\nsuspicious activity. OK?
13	Right. Then let me call the other three.
14	You're here.
15	Let's have some introductions...
16	I'm Rex, a salvager!\nPleased to meet you!
17	Me Damida.\nLooking forward, meh!
18	Juddit here.
19	...I'm Arthem.
20	I've got a subjugation mission\nfor the four of you.
21	We've confirmed the presence of\ntwelve Spike Urchon.
22	Nasty buggers...\nI need you to wipe them all out.
23	Twelve is a lot...
24	That's why you'll need to\nwork together on this.
25	Can I refuse?
26	I joined this mercenary company\nspecifically so I wouldn't have to\nrely on other chumps.
27	I'm not about to team up with\na buncha amateurs.
28	Excusing, Ms. Juddit...\nCan Damida ask to not rock boat?
29	Cooperation is name of game here\nin Garfont Mercenary Company...
30	We can split up.
31	Me still talking here...
32	Agreed.
33	You make a lot of sense, for an\nArdainian!
34	Three enemies each.
35	Uh, but if we don't stick together...
36	It's more efficient this way.
37	Hmpth...\nFine. After defeating, meet in camp\nlooking down on Farlaine Wells.
38	Got it. Will do.
39	Understood.
40	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Hmm...\nMore efficient? Sounds more like\nplain selfishness if you ask me...
41	...Best of luck to you.
qst102102_ms.json
1	You late.
2	Huh? Just the two of you?
3	Arthem first to suggest split up,\nand now last to show up...
4	Efficiency, my arse... What good is it\nif he's late?
5	Well, anyway...\nYou guys wanna chat while we wait?
6	...Hmph.
7	Damida not bothered.
8	Ha ha...ha...
qst102103_ms.json
1	Man, this blows.\nEspecially now you're talking to me.
2	(What should I ask?)
3	How was the subjugation mission?
4	How do you like the merc life?
5	I shoulda passed on this.
6	I just wanna go home.\nWhat the heck is that\nArdainian idiot doing...?
7	Hate it.
8	All these random foreigners...
9	Why are there so many?\nWhat brings them here?
10	And to make it worse, they all wanna\n"hang out," like you. Blehh!
qst102104_ms.json
1	Well well, meh.
2	(What should I ask?)
3	How was the subjugation mission?
4	How do you like the merc life?
5	Me defeat my three enemies\nand come here, quick-quick.
6	Everyone late. Mercenary work\nis group activity, so me wish\nothers would get with program.
7	Is not great.
8	Me not quite grasp yet who is where,\nwhat is what in village.
9	Nopon legs stubby, moving around\nis pain, and so life miserable for now.
qst102105_ms.json
1	Last, huh?
2	You're late!\nHow long did you expect us to wait?!
3	Whoa, take it easy...
4	Defeating five targets took\nlonger than expected.
5	That two too many!\nWhy ignore orders?
6	They came at me.\nDidn't have a choice.
7	If I'd left them, there might have\nbeen repercussions down the line.
8	...Phew, that's a relief.
9	What? Why?
10	'Cos actually, my weapon was acting\nkinda weird, so I only killed one.
11	Really?\nWhy you not say anything?
12	So you just hung around here, waiting?\nWhat were you doing?
13	Oh, shut it...
14	And anyway, what's up with the\nprecise numbering? Who decided\nit's supposed to be 12?
15	Everyone, just calm down...\nLet's not sweat the details.
16	Arthem's extra kills mean\nthe mission is now complete.
17	Nobody tell Damida anything!\nNot cool!
18	We're done here, so let's report back.
19	Meet you there?
20	...Fine by me.
21	Fine by Damida!
22	Huh?!\nOh, uh, OK then...
23	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]This doesn't help me at all...
qst102106_ms.json
1	Ah, there you are...
2	This is just a formality, but...\nare you sure you got them all?
3	(What should I say?)
4	We got all 12.
5	Apparently.
6	I will take you at your word.
7	Apparently?
8	So Juddit got less,\nand Arthem got more.
9	The numbers seem to add up\nat least, but...
10	More of those Spike Urchon\nhave appeared near the village.
11	I don't know if it's because someone\ndidn't do their job...or they bred more\nthan we anticipated...
12	Thanks. I really appreciate it.
13	We'll look into the reason later.\nFor now, go and cull the herd!
qst102107_ms.json
1	You're back...
2	Unfortunately...\nThere's more bad news.
3	In all the confusion, someone\nraided our weapon cache.
4	The timing is impeccable...\nThere's every possibility it's the work\nof that spy I spoke of earlier.
5	Please. Find the person responsible,\nand the weapons.
6	I've posted more guards at the gates to\nmake sure they don't slip out.
7	Whoever it is, they should\nstill be in the village.

1	Mohohoho!\nMushrooms and weapons now all\nproperty of Damida!
2	Meh-meh-meh?!
3	You...\nYou startle me!
4	Damida in middle of meal right now!\nShoo, shoo!
5	M-more details...?\nNopon like mushrooms,\nwhat can me say?
6	Me...me just thought, if me\nnot defeat Spike Urchon,\nthey go cause trouble in village.
7	That give me chance to raid weapon\ncache, come here to eat tasty\nmushrooms, then make getaway...
8	Meh-meh-meh! NO!\nDamida not hand over weapons!
9	Must deliver to Audumbla Mercenaries,\nor else forfeit reward!
10	I see... So the Audumbla are\nbehind this.
11	Those one-time aristocrat mercs\nhave always hated the way Vandham\nran things...
12	But this is below the belt.
13	Too much talk!\nYou! Be gone now!
14	If you not go now... Me send weapons\nand mushrooms up in flame!
15	(What should we do?)
16	Convince him
17	Pay him off
18	If me start a fire here, I die too?
19	Y-yes, setting fire in small space\nmaybe dangerous...
20	In that case, give money!\nMercenary work for money, meh!
21	You give me money?\n...How much money?
22	How much are they offering you for\nthe weapons and the information?
23	...20,000G.
24	I'll make it 30,000.
25	Oh-ho-ho?!\nFor serious?!
26	I'm buying the weapons, and you.
27	And you can do whatever you like\nwith the mushrooms here, too.
28	Mushrooms! For Damida!\nOhhh, me get dizzy!
29	A good mercenary only acts on\nsolid information...and money is\nsomething you can trust.
30	But Vandham had allies he could rely\non without need for money. Maybe one\nday, I will too...
31	Well, at least we've cleared that up.\nSorry I had to ask so much of you.
32	Deal is deal! Weapons for you!\nAnd whoop, mushrooms for Damida!\nMe going to have feeeeast!

1	I've already reported in, quite some\ntime ago.
2	Although I didn't state exactly how\nmany I defeated...
3	Maybe Arthem saying he defeated more\nthan his share...was a lie?
4	Or what, did you or Damida fail\nto hit your quota or something?
5	In any case, don't go blaming me!
6	Did you see Damida running away\nwith some parcels?
7	Maybe he was afraid of the\nSpike Urchon and decided\nto leg it! Bwahaha!
8	So maybe he didn't defeat\nhis share either...

1	You're the last one to report back.\nGet it over with quickly.
2	I definitely defeated five.

1	That Gormotti guy Nicc who\njoined up recently...
2	I think he might have killed\nmy mum and dad.
3	Back when I was only little...
4	My parents left me in Torigoth while\nthey went on a mission with a group\nof mercenaries, including him.
5	But all that came back was\ntheir Blades' Core Crystals.
6	The lady at the inn where I was\nstaying looked into it for me...
7	Turns out that guy came back\nfrom the mission alone, and then\nwent off somewhere.
8	Rumor had it that he'd betrayed his\nallies and taken the reward, or left\nthem to the monsters to save himself...
9	Whichever's the truth, he's a coward\nwho left my parents to die.
10	I tried to warn Yew that\nhe was dangerous...
11	But he wouldn't take me seriously.\nHe doesn't think Nicc seems like\na bad guy.
12	I want you to help me find proof\nthat Nicc was the one who betrayed\nmy mum and dad.
13	Really, I wanna face him with my dad's\nBlade and avenge them right now...\nBut I can't do that here in the village.
14	I want to make him apologize for\ntaking my parents from me.
15	I'm sorry to ask such a\nnasty task of you...
16	You'll find Nicc in the training ground.
17	Mum, Dad... I'll avenge you.
18	How did it go?
19	You're still not sure...?\nHuh? A mission?
20	That's the perfect chance!\nWhile you're on the mission,\nyou can get the truth out of him!
21	Talk to Nicc while you're on that\nmission, and find out what really\nhappened to my mum and dad!

2	You fought together with\nVandham, right?
3	Vandham actually took care of me\nthis one time back when I was little.
4	I lived in Gormott until recently,\nbut before that I lived in Uraya.\nThat was when I met him.
5	Anyway, when I heard the big guy\nhad passed away, I just had to come\nand pay my respects.
6	I'm about to head out on my first\nmission as a member of the band.
7	Hey, do you think you could\ncome along too?
8	I'd love to have the chance to talk\nabout Vandham with you guys.
9	Thanks! That's settled, then.
10	We're meeting up with our squad\nchief Corden in Spirit Crucible Elpys.
11	I was feeling a bit nervous, actually,\nbut now I have you guys to talk to,\nI'm kind of looking forward to it!
12	I'll see you at the meetup point.
qst102203_ms.json
1	Ah, wonderful! You made it!
2	I hear Nicc invited you to join?\nSorry to bring you all the way out here.
3	Your job is to take care of a few\nmonsters around the camp area.
4	I can't run a mission without ensuring\nmy squad's safety, you understand.
5	The monsters you're looking\nfor are three Gamen Grebel\nand three Dusky Riik.
6	Take out that many, and the rest of\n'em will get the message, I reckon.
7	Good luck out there!
8	You're looking for three Gamen Grebel\nand three Dusky Riik.
9	Show me those skills that\nVandham thought so highly of!
10	Damn, you're done already?\nNice work!
11	We were just finishing up the first stage\nof the mission here, too. Let's take a\nbreak and have a bite to eat.
12	To celebrate Nicc's first mission,\nI've put him on cooking duty!
13	Vandham did the same for me on my\nfirst mission back in the day, you know!
14	It's our little tradition!\nHahahah!
15	Really? That'd be great.\nYou go ask Nicc if there's\nanything he needs help with.
16	Maybe we'll get to dig in\na bit earlier than I expected!
17	Now, I don't have any problems\nwith Nicc's skills in battle...
18	But he has this tendency to get\nparanoid about his allies' safety.
19	I just hope he doesn't let it\nworry him too much.
20	Shade Trout and a Tarnish Apple, eh?\nI see, I see...
21	Well, you can catch Shade Trout\nright in this river. They're pretty\ncommon upstream.
22	As for Tarnish Apples...\nHmm, where would they be?
23	'Fraid I can't actually recall.\nThey're pretty rare, I can tell you that.
24	All righty then! Time for some grub!
25	You know, that Nicc lad's food\nwasn't half bad.
26	It had a...what do you call it, a Gormotti\nkick to it? That fresh, spicy taste.
27	Oh, but I'm rambling on, aren't I?\nYou want to hear your next task.
28	Well, I want you to go find me a\nShining Stalactite.
29	I heard you can find them somewhere\nhere in Spirit Crucible Elpys, but I've\nyet to come across one.
30	I'm counting on you, yeah?
31	While you're doing that, we're off to\ntake out two Brutal Aspid.
32	They're meant to be pretty\nvicious buggers.
33	It might be a bit tough on Nicc,\nfor a first mission, but it's a good\nchance for him to prove himself!
34	Your Shining Stalactite search might be\ntoo easy by comparison, but hey, you\nalready took out a bunch of monsters.
35	Well then, I guess we'll see you round!
qst102204_ms.json
1	Hey there! Thanks so much\nfor helping out.
2	Kathira told me about all the\ncool stuff you've been doing.
3	I hear you're traveling with\nsome incredibly rare Blades?
4	I worked with some folks who\nwere Drivers, back in the day.\nMan, they were strong.
5	Oh, but I shouldn't keep you when\nthere's work to be done! Just go ask\nCorden if anything's not clear.
6	Hey there! Wow, you sure made\nshort work of those monsters! Kudos!
7	I'm pretty busy with a new task -\nI've been put on cooking duty!
8	For my first mission ever, they're\nsure not making it easy, I tell you!
9	Hey, I heard you talking with the chief!\nYou're gonna help me out, huh?
10	That's a big help. I never expected\nto be cooking on my first mission,\nlet alone finding the ingredients myself!
11	The mercenaries of Garfont are\na hardened bunch, that's for sure!
12	In that case, could you help me find\na couple of ingredients I need?
13	Cooking, I'm actually pretty good at,\nbut I have no idea where to find\ningredients around these parts.
14	Besides, even if something goes\nhorribly wrong, I feel like you guys\nwould be able to handle it.
15	Sorry... I just had a bit of a bad\nexperience a few years back.
16	Thanks for the concern,\nbut I'm all right.
17	So the ingredients I'm after are\n7 Shade Trouts and a Tarnish Apple.
18	I'm not sure where to find them,\nthough... Corden and Kathira might\nknow this area better than I do.
19	Anyway, good luck!\nI'm counting on you!
20	Did you find those 7 Shade Trouts\nand a Tarnish Apple yet?\nI'm counting on you!
21	Corden and Kathira might have an idea\nwhere to find them. Me, I'm stumped.
22	Careful out there, OK?
23	Corden will brief you on the\nnext mission.
24	When that's over, I want you to tell\nme all about the time you fought\nwith Vandham!
qst102205_ms.json
1	Oh hey, there you are!\nThank goodness you're all right.
2	Did you get the ingredients?\nAh, yes, perfect! Thanks!
3	I'll cook them up in a jiffy.\nCooking is a talent of mine!
4	I think I may have made a bit too much,\nhaha... There's still so much left.
5	Oh, you want seconds? Thanks,\nthat gives me a bit of confidence!\nGormotti spice is great, isn't it?
6	Pretty much any fish is tasty when\nyou bake it with a bit of fruit and a\nhelping of good old fashioned spices!
7	Some allies I fought with once\ntaught me that.
8	This recipe is all I have left of them...
9	I was out collecting ingredients when\nit happened. Like you guys just now.
10	I was young and reckless at the time,\nand before I knew it, I'd wandered\ninto some vicious monsters' territory.
11	I ran straight back to the camp,\nfast as I could, thinking I'd be\nsafe with the others...
12	But the camp was in a quiet area, and\nnobody expected a bunch of monsters\nto suddenly descend on it.
13	I was the only one equipped to fight,\nand in the end, I was the only survivor.
14	Sometimes I wish I hadn't gone back\nto the camp. If I'd just let the monsters\neat me, everyone else would've been...
15	I'm sorry...
16	You probably didn't want to\nhear all this...
17	Myself, I meant to ask you to tell me\nall about Vandham, but I just...
18	C'mon, it looks like Corden's\ndone eating too.
19	We should go ask him about\nour next tasks.
20	Next time we get a break, you'd\nbetter tell me about all the cool\nstuff Vandham did!
qst102206_ms.json
1	P-please! Help!\nYou have to save the chief!
2	The two Brutal Aspid...they attacked\nus out of nowhere...
3	Our formation was in tatters, and\nwe all wound up separated!
4	Corden said he'd buy some time so I\ncould get away and find you guys, but\nI don't know how long he'll hold out!
5	You've gotta save the others!\nPlease!
6	Last I saw, they were in the Chamber\nof Pillars on the cavern's lowest level.
7	I'll grab some spare weapons and\nthen head right after you!
8	The squad was attacked in the\nChamber of Pillars, on the lowest level.
9	The ground's pretty precarious,\nso be careful down there!
qst102208_ms.json
1	Hey! Over here!
qst102209_ms.json
1	Chief... Everyone...
2	I'm so sorry...
3	There was nothing I could do... I hid\nCorden in here so he wouldn't fall,\nbut his wounds were too deep...
4	They're all dead...\nIt's all my fault again...
5	Nicc... We accomplished our mission.
6	Let's give the casualties a proper\nburial, then head back to the village.
7	You head back, too. I'd like to\ntalk to you at Mercenary HQ.
qst102210_ms.json
1	What's your problem, kid?!\nCan't you see we're all exhausted?
2	You let them all die again,\ndidn't you?!
3	Just like when you killed my\nmum and dad in Gormott!
4	What are you talking about...?
5	Gormott?
6	But... It can't be... You're their...?
7	I had no idea... You've grown so much...
8	Nicc? What is this about?
9	This boy is absolutely right.\nI left my comrades to die, and\nsaved my own hide.
10	I don't know what happened in\nGormott, but you're not to blame\nfor what happened here today.
11	Get out! Out of this village!\nI don't want to see you ever again!
12	Yes...you're right. If I stay here,\nI'll just get someone killed again.\nSomeone like Corden...
13	What in the...?! Hey you, help me out\nhere. What should I do with this guy?
14	(What should I say?)
15	Let them do as they wish.
16	Nicc should stay in Garfont.
17	Then it's settled. I'm leaving.
18	If I meet you outside this village,\nI'll use my dad's Blade and...
19	By all means.\nYou have the right.
20	If I'd only died alone back then,\nnone of this would have happened.
21	But, Nicc...
22	It's all right, Kathira.\nThank you for everything.
23	I'm sure I won't meet you guys\nagain, either.
24	I never did get to hear your\ntales about Vandham...
25	But I know he thought highly\nof you guys.
26	If you're supporting me in this,\nI know it's the right thing to do.
27	Farewell, everyone.
28	Now I just need to grow up\nand become a great Driver!
29	I swear I'll avenge my parents someday!
30	Vandham preferred to look to the\nfuture rather than dwell on the past...
31	But I guess there's nobody left to tell\nus if this was the right choice any more.
32	Well...I guess Vandham did think\nhighly of you guys. If you say so,\nit must be the right choice.
33	I don't think I can ever repent for\nwhat I've done, but I'll devote my\nlife to helping the people of Garfont.
34	Whaaaat?! No way!
35	Vandham didn't like to dwell\non things in the past...
36	But if you're going to stay here,\nI think you need to have a proper\ntalk with this boy.
37	You're right. I'll tell him everything.
38	What an awful tale...
39	You should never have returned\nto the camp.
40	Now, see here, young man!
41	It's all right, Kathira.\nI often tell myself the same thing.
42	Why won't you expel him from\nthe village?! I don't get you\ngrown-ups at all!
43	I'll avenge my parents one day!\nWith my dad's Blade in hand!
44	Thank you for doing that.
45	I believe Vandham would have\ndone the same.
qst102211_ms.json
1	Ah, so you're the one\nNicc was talking about.
2	You fought alongside Vandham, right?\nI've heard a lot about you.
3	My name is Kathira.\nI'm one of the old hands around here.
4	It's a pleasure.
5	Nicc is awfully cautious for\nsuch a young man.
6	Though Chief Corden always says\nI'm too rough and ready, so maybe\nwe'll balance each other out!
7	You're looking for a\nTarnish Apple?
8	I think I've seen those in the central\npart of the cavern, the area with\nall the spores flying around.
9	Just hand the ingredients over to Nicc.\nAhh, I'm dying of hunger here!
10	Wheeeeeew, I'm stuffed!\nThat was good grub!
11	The next part of the mission is gonna\nbe a toughie, but after a meal like that\nI feel ready for anything!

6	Oh...
7	Teacher left saying was going to\nrequest job of Garfont Mercenaries.
8	But no matter how Pilolo wait,\nteacher never come back...
9	Pilolo try asking people from Garfont\nMercenaries who come to Fonsa Myma,\nbut nobody know where teacher go...
10	Teacher Guztin...\nWhat should Pilolo do...?
11	Meh-meh?\nFriend find teacher for Pilolo?
12	Friend also from Garfont Mercenaries?
13	This very lucky meeting!\nPilolo so happy could cry.
14	Oh, Pilolo should clarify details.
15	Person friend should look for is\nteacher called Guztin.
16	Teacher went to visit village of\nGarfont Mercenaries, but it seem\nlike never reach village.
17	Pilolo hope friend can find teacher!
18	And hope teacher not hurt or anything...
19	Teacher Guztin is researcher of Titans!
20	Plan was to go in Uraya to get\nsomething necessary for Titan research.
21	Oh, teacher Guztin...\nPilolo hope you are OK...

1	Urghhh...\nThanks. I owe you one.
2	Yes, I...think I should be all right...
3	I thought I would be safe if I just\nreached Garfont Village, but I may\nhave overstretched myself a little...
4	Pilolo sent you to look for me...?\nAh, so you are mercenaries as well!
5	Well, this is most fortuitous.\nCould you do a little job for me?
6	My field of research is Titans.
7	For the sake of that research, I was\nhoping to obtain some Dragon Incense\nfrom inside the Dragon's Stomach.
8	That Dragon Incense works wonders\nwhen it comes to taming Titans.
9	The last time I came here,\nI was able to reach the Dragon's\nStomach without issue...
10	But for some reason this time,\nthe path is blocked off and I\ncannot reach it.
11	If it's not too much trouble,\nI'd like you to find me a way inside.
12	I'll wait at the village of the\nGarfont Mercenaries, so let me\nknow once the path is open.
13	It might be a difficult task,\nbut I'm counting on you.

6	Those Parisax! Stomach closing\nitself off to stop monsters getting in!\nNot good... Stomach get achey-achey!
7	A number of Parisax...\nIt seems the stomach has sealed itself\nto prevent the monsters from entering.

5	Please open the path to the\nDragon's Stomach.
6	We used to be able to get through\nwithout any problem... Has the Urayan\nTitan closed it off for some reason...?
7	So the path to the Dragon's Stomach\nis open once more? Excellent!
8	I see, I see... A number of Parisax\nat the stomach's entrance...
9	So that is why the path into the\nstomach was blocked off.
10	The Urayan Titan itself must have\ndetected the Parisax's presence\nand closed its own stomach off.
11	Now that you have eliminated the\nParisax, the stomach is free to open\nonce more.
12	Living bodies have many such natural\ndefense mechanisms. It's similar to how\nhumans cough when they fall ill.
13	It's easy to forget since it is so large,\nbut Uraya itself is a living creature.
14	Yes, this was a very educational\nexperience. Thank you.
15	Well then, I will head to the stomach\nand retrieve the Dragon Incense.
16	Don't worry, I'll stay well hidden.\nI've had quite enough of being\nattacked by monsters!
17	Ah yes, when you see Pilolo, could\nyou ask her to come and help me with\nmy Dragon Incense collecting?
18	Well then, farewell!

8	Oh, it no problem!\nPilolo like that about teacher actually!
9	Yes yes! Thank you for find teacher\nand help so much!

1	Welcome to the Smaia Clinic.
2	Ah, I see... Yes, I can see how other\ndoctors might not be equipped to\ntake on such an unusual case.
3	Unfortunately, Doctor Smaia\nisn't in the clinic right now.
4	She's on a trip to Temperantia, as part\nof her research on a new remedy.
5	I believe she's currently working at\nthe Ardainian military station there.
6	If you're in a hurry, it might be\nquickest to travel there and\nfind her yourself.
7	No no, that's quite all right.\nFrankly, I'm sorry I couldn't do more\nto help after you came all this way.
8	Just...try not to be too shocked\nwhen you do meet the Doctor.
9	It's just that she's a little...eccentric.\nPeople tend to be somewhat\ntaken aback.
10	Doctor Smaia is conducting research\nat the Mor Ardain military installation\nin Temperantia.
11	I wish you the best of luck finding her.
12	Doctor Smaia is back from her\nresearch trip. I guess things are going\nto get lively around here again.
13	Which ingredient would you like\nto hear about?
14	(Which should I ask about?)
15	Gloomwood Root
16	Cloud Sea Halite
17	A vegetable that makes you feel young
18	Gloomwood Root can be found in\nSpirit Crucible Elpys, or so I've heard.
19	As the name suggests, it's a root,\nso you'll probably find it in an area\nwith plant life.
20	Cloud Sea Halite is a natural salt\nfound on the Cliffs of Morytha.
21	You'll probably have the most luck\nin rocky areas like caves.
22	Ah yes, that's a difficult one...\nDoctor Smaia does demand the most\noddly specific things sometimes.
23	Actually, I think I heard something\nabout a farmer in Gormott trying to\ncultivate a brand-new vegetable...
24	Maybe you should go and see\nif that would suit our purposes.
25	Would you like to hear about\nDragon Incense?
26	What should we do?
27	Hear the explanation.
28	Not interested.
29	Dragon Incense is a crystallized\nsubstance formed from the digestive\nsecretions of the Urayan Titan.
30	It's hard to procure in large quantities,\nbut has an exquisite aroma and medical\nproperties, so it sells for a high price.
31	True Dragon Incense is the name given\nto samples of exceptionally high purity.
32	It's said that once upon a time, you\ncould build a whole house for the price\nof a single True Dragon Incense crystal.
33	The secretion is unique to the Urayan\nTitan; no other Titans produce it.
34	I think that just about covers it.\nWell, good luck out there!
35	Oh, all right. Take care, then.
36	Ah, you must have found the\nTrue Dragon Incense.\nI can tell from the scent.
37	Mmmmmm...the fragrance is exquisite!
38	I always thought Flesh Eaters were\nnothing more than a legend, you know.
39	It's quite a revelation to learn that\nthey actually exist! I'd like to meet\none someday.

1	Haven't seen you around these parts.\nYou after something?
2	Oh, that doctor...
3	She headed off to Toxbloom Spring.\nSaid she was going to fetch ingredients\nfor her new remedy or something.
4	Honestly, going to a place like that\nwithout a proper guard for protection...\nShe's a crazy one, all right.
5	Toxbloom Spring is across\nDesta Plains, on the way to\nthe Ancient Wall.
6	As you'd expect from the name,\nit's a dangerous place, surrounded\nby a poisonous swamp.
7	If you're heading that way,\nyou'd best take care.
8	Did you ever find that doctor\nyou were looking for?
9	She's a weird one, all right, but\nher skills are the real deal.
10	I saw her at work as a military doctor\nonce. She took care of the patients\nwith frightening efficiency.

1	Oh, you're here.\nWhat are the patient's symptoms?
2	A Flesh Eater?
3	Fusion of man and Blade...
4	Interesting. I'll help you.
5	Saw some old records about them\nwhen I was a military doctor.\nDidn't know they were really out there.
6	Where's the patient?\n...Uraya?
7	I was with the Ardainian military.\nCan't go there.
8	Still, if he's half human...
9	You take care of the Blade side there.\nI'll deal with the human half.
10	Details can wait.\nI'll make a medicine.
11	I need three Gloomwood Roots...\none crystal of Cloud Sea Halite...\nOh, and one more thing.
12	Gotta have some kind of vegetable.\nOne that makes you feel younger\njust by eating it.
13	You'll find the first two ingredients in\nSpirit Crucible Elpys and the Cliffs\nof Morytha.
14	Don't know where to find that\nvegetable, though. Try asking my\nassistant.
15	Roots... Roots...
16	Very good.
17	Just one more thing I need now.
18	Dragon Incense.
19	But from the symptoms you mentioned,\nthe normal stuff won't cut it.
20	Got to be the pure stuff.\nTrue Dragon Incense from Uraya.
21	Go get some for me.
22	True Dragon Incense comes from the\nDragon's Stomach in Uraya.
23	For a single adult male...\ntwo samples should do.
24	Bring it quick, for the patient's sake.
25	What's Dragon Incense?\nAssistant!
26	There. Ask him.
27	True Dragon Incense...\nIndeed.
28	Got to make an infusion, boil with\nthe other ingredients and stir for\nthree straight days and nights.
29	...I'd probably fall asleep.
30	Assistant has other work to do, too.\nCan't attend to this constantly.
31	Your friends will help?\nPerfect.
32	Flesh Eaters...\nFusions of man and Blade...
33	Just like me and roots.
34	Medicine's all finished.\nVery high quality.
35	Contains special ethocrines to improve\nthe body's circulatory efficiency.
36	Ought to trigger tissue restoration\nonce the Blade power has been\nnormalized and... Hmm.
37	You know what? Too hard to explain.\nJust make him drink this and do your\nBlade fixing.
38	Won't be perfect, though.\nNothing is.
39	He'll still die eventually.\nHe's only human.
40	Now hurry on back to the patient.
41	I love a job well done.

3	Well well, what have we here?\nA strange little band indeed.
4	Different peoples coming together to\nshatter the bonds of nationalism.\nPerhaps you are just what I need...
5	Yes, I suppose there can be\nno harm in sharing my worries\nwith you fine people.
6	My name is Alisdeigh.\nI am a scholar specializing\nin ancient Nopon culture.
7	There are remains of their mural work\nin every corner of the world.
8	I have heard that ancient Nopon murals\neven exist in Uraya. I would like nothing\nmore than to examine them, but...
9	Well, I'm sure you're aware of the\nsituation. Relations between Uraya\nand Mor Ardain are strained of late.
10	These days, any research that we\ncarry out in Uraya is considered\nto be "intelligence gathering".
11	Personally, I've never been one\nto shy away from a little danger\nin the name of research.
12	However, attempting to enter Uraya\nthrough official channels would no\ndoubt exacerbate the political situation.
13	Were I but ten years younger,\nI'd stow away on a merchant ship\nand enter Uraya in secret.
14	Hmm...\nYou do realize you'd be putting\nyourselves in danger too, right?
15	Meeting you was a stroke of luck.\nThank you for helping out!
16	So, what kind of plan are we\ntalking about here?
17	Oho, I see, I see!\nYou'll enlist the help of your comrades.
18	I've got it!\nI'll disguise myself as your old\nservant and try to blend in.
19	Don't be afraid to ask anything\nof me! It'll make my disguise\nall the more believable.
qst103102_ms.json
1	Ugh... Blergh...\nWait just a moment, please...
2	Ahh, it's you.\nI hate for you to see me like this.
3	I'm not built for sea travel.\nNever have been. And I don't\nrecover so quickly in my old age.
4	Thanks to you, I finally made it out\nhere, but I can barely stand.
5	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Really?! You would?!\nThat's wonderful to hear!
6	Ugh... Blergh...\nIf I raise my voice, my head starts\nthrobbing again... Apologies...
7	According to the villagers, ancient\nNopon murals are found in three\nplaces around here.
8	I'm sure anyone with a bit of\nNopon wisdom would be able to\nread the words written there.
9	Oh, that reminds me. I heard something\nstrange about the murals here.
10	A villager was heading home past one\nof the murals late at night, and they say\nsomething seemed...different about it.
11	On a hunch, they went back the\nnext morning, but apparently\nnothing in particular had changed.
12	I'm convinced there's something going\non there. Would you kindly investigate?
13	There are three ancient\nNopon murals in this village.
14	Reports that something strange is\ngoing on with them at night have\nkind of piqued my interest.

3	Tell me, did you manage to read\nwhat was written on the murals?
4	What's that you say? The writing\nwas different during the day and night?
5	Hmm...\nThese clues seem positively pregnant\nwith meaning - but what, I can't say.
6	In particular, this use of "daylight stars"\ncatches my eye...
7	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Eureka!\nI have it!\n...Uerghh...
8	Sorry about that...\nI got carried away for a moment.
9	You see, the ancient Nopon were\nvoyagers, sailing from place to place.
10	They read the stars to find\ntheir way. It let them navigate\nwith extraordinary accuracy.
11	So, the "daylight stars" here must\nrepresent some kind of path or\nguide. Which means...
12	The mural locations\nall had names, didn't they?
13	"The Shrine of Journeys"...\n"The Shrine of Light"...\n"The Shrine of Offering"...
14	"Offer Light On The Journey"...\nWhy, this is a key to the reading order!
15	In which case... That means the\nfull nighttime message would be...
16	"Three Daylight Stars\n Offer Light On The Journey\n To Hero's Treasure"
17	And the daytime message is...
18	"Farlaine Waters\n The Youthful Elder\n In Whose Embrace I Sleep"
19	So the nighttime message is a key\nto the daytime one... And the daytime\nmessage...seems to indicate a location?
20	I'm very sorry, but I\nam no expert on\nUrayan geography.
21	Might I persuade you to\ninvestigate the place indicated?
22	I have done all in my power to unravel\nthis riddle. The rest is up to you.

11	Oh, brilliant!\nIt's nice to be remembered.

14	Including the faces of everyone\nwho was watching!
15	After that, they brought me\nhere to Alba Cavanich for\nbasic training...
16	And now I finally made it! I'm an\nofficial Driver of the Imperial Army!
17	My position in the army lets\nme send back money to my\nbrothers and sister, which is nice.
18	I'm glad they're getting support now,\nbut I can't help feeling bad for leaving.\nFirst Ma and Da, and now me...
19	Our parents weren't really fans of the\nArdainian army. I wonder if they'd be\ndisappointed if they could see me now.
20	Ah well. No use worrying\nover spilled milk.
21	Anyway, I've got other problems.
22	I want to send some Ardainian sweets\nand toys to my family back home.\nI bet they'd get a real kick out of them.
23	But as a new recruit I don't get\nmuch time off, and getting back to\nTorigoth isn't really on the cards.
24	I already bought the sweets, but at\nthis rate they'll go off before I can\ngive them to my brothers and sister.
25	You'll help me out?\nThank you so much!
26	I'll run and fetch the stuff right away!
27	Oof, it's a little heavy. Guess I went\na bit overboard...\nThank you for agreeing to this!

4	Whazzat?
5	From big bro?
6	Oh, cool!\nIt's not just money for a change!
7	Lemme see, lemme see!
8	Thanks for bringing it to us!
9	Ever since our big bro became a Driver,\nwe've been eating our fill!
10	Drivers are super cool!
11	If only Da hadn't had to leave...
12	Those Ardainian dummies didn't\nmake Ma better, either...
13	But at least they made our bro\na Driver!
14	Ma... *sniff*
15	Morca!\nYou promised you wouldn't cry\nfor Ma anymore.
16	Oh, yeah... Gotta be strong.\nSorry, Neel...
17	After Ma passed away,\nDa just took off.
18	That was when our bro decided\nto see if he could become a Driver.
19	I'm gonna be a Driver too!\nThen I can help out Big Bro!
20	Me too, me too! I'd love to have\none of those animal Blades!
21	Hey, you two.\nThank the nice people properly.
22	Thank you for\nall the neat stuff!
23	Thanks!
24	If you see our brother again,\nplease tell him we're doing good.
25	Thanks again!

5	That's good.
6	I just wish Da would come back\nto take care of them like he should.
7	After Ma died, he just walked\nout on us. "Blame the Empire,\nnot me," he said.
8	But now it's the Empire that's\nputting food on our table...
9	Anyway, enough about that.\nThis is quite the situation.
10	We don't really have any leads on the\nidentity of the deceased woman...
11	Thanks for your support.\nIf you could find some kind of clues,\nanything at all, that would be great.

1	Do you recognize her, Lady Mòrag?
2	I do.
3	Her name is Saundra Arascain.\nShe is...was...a senator.
4	A senator?!\nOh my!
5	Indeed. Her husband also sits\non the Senate, as I recall.
6	Th-this is bad. This is a major incident.\nI don't think I'm qualified to...
7	Sir! Sir, I need help here!
8	Take her body to HQ and get\na field surgeon to look at her.
9	Yes ma'am!
10	Oh, and...I guess someone\nneeds to tell her family...
11	Leave that to me.
12	I-if you're sure, ma'am.\nIt must be difficult...
13	I'm accustomed to it.
14	What an unhappy thing\nto grow accustomed to...
15	This woman is...\nNo, I have no idea who she is.
16	It would take someone familiar with\nMor Ardain or this area to identify her...
17	I don't think we know anyone like that\nright now. We might need to return to\nthis case later...

4	Special Inquisitor Mòrag...?\nWhat can I do for you?
5	Senator Saundra Arascain\nwas found murdered.
6	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]M-my wife?
7	You can't be serious.\nTell me you're joking.
8	But...\nLady Mòrag doesn't make\njokes, does she?
9	Saundra...\nMy Saunie...
10	Did she have any enemies?
11	She was...the fairest and most honest\nperson I know. I can't imagine what\nanyone could possibly hold against her.
12	Although, if I had to point the finger...\nit would be those anti-imperialists.
13	I hesitate to mention such things\nin your presence, Special Inquisitor.
14	But there are many who resent the\ncurrent regime and resort to violence\nrather than reasoned debate.
15	Of late, their efforts have grown\nmore organized. Some people are\nbeginning to take them seriously.
16	My wife...Saunie was planning to\npropose legislation to enact tighter\ncontrols on such organizations.
17	Surely that couldn't be why...
18	Tell me, where did she...?
19	My wife loved it there.\nShe often visited without\na security detail.
20	But nobody would know that, save\nmyself and her secretary, Cruim.
21	Cruim!\nCruim, are you here?
22	Where could he have gotten to?\nHe's usually very prompt.
23	You don't think...\nCruim?
24	Saundra Arascain's body is being taken\nto Military HQ.
25	Would you please go and\ntake custody of it?
26	We will take care of finding\nthis secretary.
27	Thank you, Lady Mòrag.
28	Ohhh, what am I going to\ntell my son?\nHe's too young to understand...
29	Smùide Hot Spring.

6	Still, the culprit would need military\nhelp to get through the gate and reach\nthis place... What could it mean?
qst103315_ms.json
1	Here's your reward.
2	Thank you. But what in the world\nwould you want with information\non milady's routine, anyway?
3	No need to trouble\nyourself with that.
4	Yeah, she already snuffed it.
5	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Wh-what?\nYou never said anything about that!
6	Shut it, old man.\nYou're already in it up to your neck.
7	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Who are you people?!
8	They don't belong around here...\nWay too squeaky-clean for that.
9	Scram! Beat it! Gerrout of here!
10	Then I guess we'll have to\nget rid of you ourselves! Yahhh!
qst103316_ms.json
1	Oh, wow! Looks like you\ndidn't need my help.
2	Ughh...\nI beg you, spare me my life...
3	I did nothing wrong...
4	I only gave them the details of milady's\nroutine! I had no idea they'd...
5	Oh, yes! I have something for you!
6	It's a key to these scoundrels'\nsecret hideout!
7	They're holed up in an old\nwarehouse in the lower city.
8	It's true, I swear it!\nI wouldn't lie to you!
9	S-see, I'll provide you valuable\ninformation! I'm no ally of theirs!\nSo please!
10	Do we trust him?
11	Yes
12	No
13	Oh, thank goodness.
14	You may not be one of them,\nbut you'd still better tell us\neverything you know!
15	Please! I had no idea they\nwould kill milady! You have\nto believe me!
16	You can furnish us with the\nrest of your lies back at HQ!
17	I'll take this miscreant\ninto custody.
18	Can I ask you to check\nout this secret hideout?
19	Once I've handed him over\nto HQ, I'll go join you.

1	Are you guys all right?!
2	What the-\nJac?!
3	Huh?
4	...Is that you, Da?!
5	What are you doing in\nthe Imperial Army?
6	What are YOU doing\nwith these rebels and lowlifes?!
7	Like you don't know why.\nRevenge, my boy! I'm glad\nyou managed to forget so easily.
8	It's the Empire who let your\nma die. We'll never be\nanything but chattel to them.
9	Of course I haven't forgotten.\nBut after you left we needed\nto survive somehow.
10	So I risked my life on a chance.\nBecame a Driver for the Empire.\nFor my family!
11	What have you been doing since\nyou left us?
12	I told you, boy.\nI've been seeking our revenge.
13	An innocent woman is dead!\nShe had a bloody family!
14	All you've managed to do is leave\nyet another kid without a mother!
15	Ma wouldn't have wanted this!\nShe would never have wanted revenge!
16	I...I'm doing the same thing as them...?\nI'm...no better...
17	...Are the others well?
18	Yes, they're fine, thanks to money\nfrom the Empire. What's it to you?
19	If you can forgive me...\nI'll return home to Torigoth\nand we can be a family again.
20	...I don't know.\nWhat should I do?
21	Can you help me?
22	What should we say?
23	Hand him over to the army.
24	Banish him from Mor Ardain.
25	Let him do as he likes.
26	I understand.\nI'll go quietly.
27	You must tell the army\neverything you know, Da.
28	There's a whole network of people\nwith anti-imperial sentiments.
29	But I'm just a fringe member. I don't\nknow anything about the bigwigs.
30	I'm sorry I couldn't be more use.
31	I'll take responsibility for him.\nI'll take him back to HQ.
32	Thanks for all your help.
33	Oh, take this by way of thanks.\nSee you around.
34	Exile...\nThen I suppose I'll head for Torigoth.
35	Get an honest job and work to\nrepay what I owe the kids.
36	Da!
37	Oh, but before that...you have to tell\nus what you know about whoever\nmurdered Saundra.
38	There's a whole network of people\nwith anti-imperial sentiments.
39	But I'm just a fringe member. I don't\nknow anything about the bigwigs.\nI'm sorry...
40	Well, I guess I'll be escorting\nhim to the port.
41	Thanks for all your help.
42	This is for you.\nSee you around!
43	As I like...?\nThen...
44	I'll go home to Torigoth.\nGet an honest job and work to\nrepay what I owe the kids.
45	Da!
46	Oh, but before that...you have to tell\nus what you know about whoever\nmurdered Saundra.
47	There's a whole network of people\nwith anti-imperial sentiments.
48	But I'm just a fringe member. I don't\nknow anything about the bigwigs.
49	I'm sorry. I'll leave the capital now.\nHead for Torigoth.
50	OK. Take care, Da.\nIf I get the time I'll come visit.
51	Thanks for all your help.
52	This is for you.\nSee you around!

15	We found fresh footprints on the\ntop of the cliff just above here.

17	Could you go see what he's\nup to, please?

qst103401_ms.json
1	Ah, just the faces I was hoping to see!
2	A report has come in from one of our\nmen on an intelligence mission.
3	Specifically, information regarding\nthose accursed anti-imperialists who\ntook the life of my wife.
4	It seems they are an organized\nanti-imperialist alliance, calling\nthemselves Brionac.
5	And the members of Brionac will\nsoon be conducting a secret assembly.
6	The place is Mine No. 2...\nRight under the nose of the imperial\ncapital!
7	Of course, the ideal plan would be to\nbring this to the Senate and take\nmilitary action against Brionac.
8	But if someone were to obstruct such\nofficial action, just like with my wife...
9	In the worst case scenario,\nthey might even target my son.\nThe mere thought of it terrifies me...
10	I can't express how grateful I am\nto hear that.
11	If you will look into this for me,\nI can concentrate on ensuring my\nfamily's safety.
12	So, just to review the details...
13	I need you to go to Mine No. 2.
14	There should only be a few key\nmembers of Brionac present for\nthe assembly, but do be careful.
15	I wish I could bring this Brionac\ncase to the Senate and take\nofficial military action...
16	But after what happened to my wife,\nit's impossible to be too careful.
17	You're the only ones I can trust\nwith this. I'm counting on you.
qst103402_ms.json
1	Master Akatsuki, these people are...
2	Ah, the ones who interfered\nwith our recent operation.
3	Well, everyone! It seems the Empire\nhas sent warriors to deal with us!
4	Let us show them that Brionac\nwill not be so easily felled!
qst103403_ms.json
1	Believe me, you haven't won yet.
2	Let's see how much more of this\nyou can handle!
qst103404_ms.json
1	You're tough...I'll give you that.
2	But are you sure you have time\nto be wasting around here?
3	What about the fellow who sent you\nhere, hmm? Do you think he's all right?
4	Ahahah...\nGot your attention now, have I?
5	Well, if you'd like to go and check\nup on him, don't let us stop you.\nWe of Brionac will be happy to wait.
6	Hee hee hee...\nRun along now, my dears!
qst103405_ms.json
1	You're worried about me?\nNo, I can't say I've run into any\ntrouble in particular...
2	What? You were attacked by a huge\nforce of soldiers...and they threatened\nthat harm would come to me as well?
3	Well, they haven't tried anything yet.\nAnd I can't imagine they could get\nclose, as long as I stay in the palace.
4	I've brought my son to the palace\nas well, just to be safe. I even have\nguards watching over him.
5	What worries me is that the enemy\nwas gathered in far greater numbers\nthan my information suggested.
6	Was the information that it would be\na small gathering simply mistaken?\nOr were they expecting us?
7	That Blade named Akatsuki who seems\nto be giving the orders...he may be a\nmore formidable foe than I had feared.
8	Whatever the reason, I must apologize\nfor sending you into such danger.
9	I actually just received new\ninformation about where the\nBrionac leaders are headed.
10	The word "leaders" makes me suspect\nthat Akatsuki's Driver may be involved.
11	This may be an opportunity to\nneutralize Akatsuki once and for all...\nBut it may also be another trap.
12	Thank you so much for all your help.
13	As for where to find these leaders...
14	One of them, a man named Wiggins,\nshould be on the roof of a building\nin Ayvill Shopping District.
15	In the roof area of the Old Industrial\nDistrict, you should find a man\nnamed Bhianc.
16	And finally, there's Arrodh.\nHe should be near the large tank\nby the Cargo Transportation Zone.
17	If my intelligence is correct, these three\nBrionac leaders will be conducting\ncovert transactions at those locations.
18	Please do be careful.
19	Akatsuki may be a formidable Blade,\nbut any Blade can be neutralized by\ntaking down their Driver.
20	This is our chance to take down\nthe anti-imperialists of Brionac\nonce and for all.
qst103406_ms.json
1	It's good to see you're safe!\nHow did the mission go?
2	So Akatsuki's Driver wasn't among\nthe Brionac leaders...
3	No...there's no need for you to\nworry yourselves any longer.
4	I think it's time we withdrew\nfrom this whole business.
5	One of my subordinates who was\ngathering intelligence for me has\nbeen attacked.
6	It may only be a matter of time before\nthey come after me or my son...
7	But now that we've taken out the\nleaders, Brionac's schemes will\nfall apart sooner or later.
8	Ah, you're still worried about Akatsuki.
9	But it would be far too dangerous\nto pursue this any further...
10	All right. But if you're going to keep\ninvestigating, you'll have to do so alone.
11	I can't provide you with any more\nintelligence on Akatsuki or his Driver.
12	You'll have to find them by yourselves.
13	I'm sorry. But when I think of my son,\nthis is the only choice I can...
14	Thank you for doing this.
15	I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't\ntalk to me out in the open like this.
16	You never know who might\nbe watching...
qst103407_ms.json
1	How did you find this place?!
2	Akatsuki. Who are these people?
3	The pawns I told you about.
4	I see... So he wasn't able to stop them.\nThat useless fool!
5	Couldn't be satisfied with just taking\ncare of the Brionac leaders, could you?
6	It's time you learned not to\nget in our way!
qst103408_ms.json
1	Akatsuki...\nYou remember our promise.
2	I know.
3	Do it.
4	As you wish.
5	I hope you don't think this is over.
6	Brionac is not the only organization\nplanning rebellion against the\nArdainian Empire.
7	I'm afraid there is no time.
8	In mere moments, I will return\nto my Core Crystal.
9	I will forget everything.\nEven the ideals I have long\npursued by his side...
10	But the things we have accomplished...\nI cannot bear for them to be forgotten.
11	If you are left no alternative, surely you\nwill seek my people out... That way, our\ndeeds will live on in your minds...
12	Glory be to Lindwurm!
13	Remember...that name.\nRemember it...till your dying day!\nGahahah...
qst103409_ms.json
1	Is there something you want to discuss?
2	What? You defeated Akatsuki and\nhis Driver? Are you certain?
3	A Core Crystal...\nThis is Akatsuki's?
4	Would it be all right if I kept hold\nof this? As evidence, you understand.
5	Thank you.
6	With this, I suppose the anti-imperialist\nschemes of Brionac really are finished.
7	What? Another organization?!
8	Lindwurm...\nI'm sorry, I can't say I've ever\nheard the name before.
9	Of course, it may not be wise to take\neverything Akatsuki said at face value.
10	There was that time when he\ntaunted you with empty threats\nbefore letting you leave, after all.
11	At any rate, thank you for all the work\nyou've done in service of the Empire.
12	We can handle the task of rounding\nup any remaining stray rebels, so don't\nworry yourselves any further.

1	They wouldn't have them in\nshops, I guess...
2	My friend's moving away, so I wanted\nto make him a pendant like one that\nI saw in a book.
3	What a charming idea.
4	I'm sure a little keepsake like that will\nsoften the pain of parting a little.
5	Indeed. It's like how we keep journals,\nso that it's not so bad when we lose\nour memories.
6	I only wish I had some records of\nmy time with the Emperor.
7	It was very sudden, what happened\nto you. It's a shame, but there's not\nmuch we could do.
8	Though Lady Mòrag and I will of course\ntell you what we know of your past.
9	At least once our journey is over,\nyou should be able to get to know\nHis Majesty all over again.
10	Indeed...
11	Tell me, young lady... What kind of\npendant did you have in mind?
12	I wanted to make one with some of the\nRosary Moss from the World Tree.\nThey say it brings luck!
13	But, they don't sell it in any\nof the shops...
14	You want to make your friend both\nhappy and fortunate then?
15	Yeah!
16	He said he has to move away\nbecause his mother died...
17	So I just want him to be happy.
18	That is a sad loss...
19	My friends...if it is all right with you all,\nI would like to help this girl to obtain\nwhat she requires.
20	Thank you.
21	I promise to get what you need, my\nchild.
22	Really? Thank you so much!
23	I'd be so grateful if I could have it in\ntime to make it before he goes...
qst103602_ms.json
1	Treat it with care, young lady.
2	Wow! Thank you!
3	If I make it now, I'll be able to get it\ndone before he has to go!
4	Where is your friend going?\nTo Gormott Province, perhaps?
5	Ah, no.\nTo Fonsa Myma.
6	Fonsa Myma...\nNot many people choose to move to\nUraya...
7	Him and his dad... They're going to\nseek asylum there.
8	Seek asylum?
9	Well, he won't tell me the details in\ncase he makes his dad angry.
10	What kind of person is your friend's\nfather exactly?
11	Um, I've never met him...
12	Your friend's name, then?
13	Well...uhh...
14	The way to Fonsa Myma from the\nimperial capital is very difficult.
15	So we'd like to offer to help them\nwith moving there, if that's all right.
16	Oh...
17	His name is Mahl Arascain.
18	If you run into him, don't tell him about\nthe pendant, OK?
19	We promise.
20	Have this as a little thank-you!\nBye!
21	You have a rather harsh way with\nchildren, don't you think, Aegaeon?
22	Forgive me. My knowledge of social\nmores is unpolished, I know.
23	You were the same with Niall\nwhen he was small.
24	Do you think it was embarrassing for\nthe boy?
25	Embarrassing? You used to reduce him\nto tears!
26	Oh, I am a disgrace.\nAn Emperor's Blade should not\nbe so foolish!
27	I must atone.\nI must return to my Core Crystal!
28	Never mind that!\nMore importantly, doesn't the name\n"Arascain" sound familiar?
29	Do you remember?
30	I remember.
31	I can't remember.
32	I expected no less.
33	Senator Stulc Arascain! The one whose\nwife was killed at Smùide Hot Spring!
34	Let's find him, and find out why he\nneeds to seek asylum!
qst103603_ms.json
1	Hey! Good to see you!\nYou're looking well!
2	Senator Stulc Arascain, you say?\nHe's not here.
3	I saw him leaving with his boy\na while back...
4	Fleeing to Fonsa Myma?\nBut that's crazy...
5	Hmmm... It's Port Anangham for\nUraya-bound shipping, I'd think...
6	Let me go check the departure log!
7	Please! Guard the port!
qst103604_ms.json
1	We need to get out of this town as\nsoon as we can...
2	Hey!\nCareful with my things!
3	May I assist you?
4	Who's that?!
5	May I ask to where you are heading,\nfrom Niall's fair city?
6	Th-the Empire's most powerful Blade?!\nWhy are you here?!
7	So you were followed, were you...?\nOf all the careless...
8	I...I didn't...
9	Well, we've got a chance to strike a\nblow against the Empire!\nLet's take it!
qst103605_ms.json
1	Help me!\nThese people are threatening me!\nThey're taking me against my will!
2	Didn't look that way to me...
3	Why don't we get the story straight\nback at Hardhaigh Palace?
4	It's true I tell you!\nPlease believe me!
5	Someone!\nHelp!
6	I've just received word that remnants\nof the Brionac rebel forces are heading\nfor the capital!
7	The Emperor!
8	We need to head there now!
9	I...I'll come along and...
10	I'll keep an eye on the senator,\ndon't you worry!
11	Everyone! Head to Midorl Bridge as\nfast as you can!
qst103606_ms.json
1	Brionac...\nI thought by defeating their leaders\nwe had weakened them sufficiently...
2	Yet they seem to be going strong, still.
3	It appears we have no recourse but to\ndeploy to the Brionac Occupied Zone\nand put them down decisively.
4	As you say.\nThis threat to the Empire\ncannot be left to fester...
qst103607_ms.json
1	Yes... That seems to be the last of the\nBrionac membership, taken care of.
2	Let's go back to Port Anangham.
3	We need to find out\neverything we can!
qst103608_ms.json
1	I'm all right...just about...but...
2	The ship...\nHas it already sailed?
3	Yes...\nI'm afraid Senator Stulc got away.
4	Some of his allies had concealed\nthemselves on the ship.
5	The attack by Brionac must have just\nbeen a ruse so that the senator could\nescape...
6	I'm so sorry...
7	The boat's headed for Uraya!
8	Then we should head for Fonsa Myma.
9	We'll chase him to the ends of Alrest!
10	I'll report this incident to my superiors!
qst103609_ms.json
1	Hey, did you see that?
2	That Ardainian just now!\nHe seemed pretty worked up\nabout something.
3	He seemed to be heading for\nthe Great Stairway.
4	There aren't usually many people\nround there. So take care if you go!
5	What would an Ardainian want\naround these parts?
6	I hope he's not planning to\nstir up any fuss...
7	My curiosity got the better of me,\nso I went over to the Great Stairway\nmyself to see what was up.
8	I found that Ardainian, but he\nwas all laid out on the ground!\nSo I took him to a doctor.
9	No need to thank me. I wouldn't leave\nanyone high and dry like that, not even\nan Ardainian.
qst103610_ms.json
1	Z-Zadazan... You would...\nbetray...me...?
2	Me betray you?\nYou most biggest traitor of all!
3	At least did good job weakening\nanti-imperial forces inside Empire.\nThat Brionac lot was eyesore.
4	But at far too high price. Thanks to you,\nwe lose valuable agents who infiltrate\nour enemies, including Akatsuki!
5	And you even bring unwanted guests\nall the way here!
6	Urrghhh...\nS-Saundra... Saundra!
7	Senator man fainted.
8	Time for Zadazan leave.
qst103611_ms.json
1	Meddlers who not know when to quit\nbecome food for Kapiba!
2	Bash 'em up!
qst103612_ms.json
1	That Nopon...\nIt looks like he escaped.
2	Perhaps we should return to the\ncapital and tell Jac about it.
qst103613_ms.json
1	Ah, you made it!
2	We've had notification from the Urayan\ngovernment that the senator will be\nextradited.
3	His son is being held safely at a\nmilitary installation.
4	Good to hear.
5	What kind of a parent puts his child\nthrough that...
6	I think he'll be all right in the end,\nthough.
7	What? There are still anti-imperialist\nagents at large?!
8	And the Nopon are involved...
9	Sorry, but I don't really have any\ninformation that would help you right\nnow.
10	It seems that we've encountered an\nimpasse.
11	Brighid!\nYou mustn't give up!
12	Our purpose in life is to defend the\nEmperor and the Empire!
13	If we continue our search, we're\nsure to find something that leads\nus to those scoundrels!
14	You have a fire in your soul, Aegaeon.\nYou wouldn't think so to look at you.
15	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Perhaps this is Rex's influence?
16	Everyone! Let's look for some clues!
qst103614_ms.json
1	I've got some Rabbit Diodes and\npressed Dawn Hydrangea flowers.
2	Now I just need some Rosary Moss.\nI'm going to make it into twine to\nstring them all together.
qst103615_ms.json
1	I'll keep my eye on Senator Stulc!
2	When you get back, you can help\nme organize his transferal.
qst103616_ms.json
1	Please! Let me go!
2	I haven't done anything wrong!\nI'm totally innocent!
3	Hmph. Obstructing official business is\na pretty major crime, you know!
qst103617_ms.json
1	According to the senator, the capital's\ndefenses should be weak right now...\nBut we're almost wiped out!
2	You... You've obstructed us every step\nof the way...
3	Wait! When you say "senator"...\nYou mean from the Imperial Senate?
4	That's right. An imperial senator\nby the name of Stulc.
5	The soldiers we'd managed to gather\nwere already stretched to their limits\nfollowing Akatsuki's orders...
6	And then you people wiped out all\nof our leaders! Brionac is done for!
7	It was none other than the senator\nwho told us where to find those\nBrionac leaders.
8	It was Akatsuki who chose the locations\nfor those transactions... This can only\nmean... Ugh! Curse that beast!
9	Akatsuki seemed to indicate that he\nwas with Lindwurm just before he\nreturned to his Crystal, did he not?
10	Lindwurm!\nSo they were pulling the strings\nthe whole time!
11	It sounds like both Akatsuki and\nthe senator may have been\nmembers of Lindwurm.
12	In which case, this raid is nothing\nmore than a diversion for him to\nescape the Empire...
13	That senator... Double-dealing bastard!
14	It seems we were all led astray here.\nLet us put aside our differences and...
15	Silence!\nNo! How can you forget about our\nobjective so quickly?
16	If there is any strength left in this\norganization... We'll use it to destroy\nthe Empire's Blades!
qst103618_ms.json
1	Have you something to discuss with\nmy master? Please, speak your mind.
2	My master and I will watch over\nthe senator. You should all hurry\nto Midorl Bridge!
3	Those reinforcements took us\ncompletely unawares...\nI feel so ashamed of myself.

1	Rex!\n58,954G? Thank you so much!
2	You take good care of us.
3	Huh? Are you sure it wasn't\ncloser to 90,000G?
4	Um, nope, that's definitely right.\n58,954G.
5	But that's about 30,000G short!\nMaybe some of the money was stolen\non the way?
6	Dearie me, do you really think so?
7	I did think it seemed like a\nstrange amount...
8	And when I sent you that Cloud Sea\nBraised Shark, the handling fee\nwas simply enormous.
9	Hmm.\nWe gotta investigate this.
10	We should go check with Max\nthe courier in Argentum.
qst103903_ms.json
1	'Sup, got something to send?
2	The amount of money that arrived\nwas way too small?
3	What d'you think I'm doing, cooking\nthe books with the handling fees?\nIs that what you're saying?
4	It's true I don't always send the\nmoney right away. I wait until you've\ndeposited 90,000G or so.
5	But that's to keep the handling fees\ndown, not up. Fonsett's a long way off,\nso it's pricey to make lots of trips.
6	The Argentum Trade Guild skims off\n2% right off the bat, you know. Send\n90,000G, they take nearly two grand.
7	So each delivery that leaves here\nshould come to 88,200G.
8	From here, the next stop would be\nHuw at the couriers in Torigoth.
9	There's no direct passage to Leftheria\nfrom here so we gotta send it via him.
10	Check with Huw in Torigoth.\nMaybe it's his fees that are\neating into your savings.
11	If there's something fishy going on,\nI'll see what I can do to help.
12	You're one of my best customers!
13	You might think some of these fees are\na little high, but y'know what they say.
14	"If you're smiling at the price, then\nsomebody else is crying."
15	That's no way to do business.\nBetter if everyone gets a fair\nprice for an honest day's work.
16	You want to set up a direct shipping\nroute between Argentum and Fonsett?
17	Hoo boy.\nThere just isn't enough going to\nFonsett to justify a daily trip.
18	But since it's you...\nI'll see what I can do.
19	Right, if it's once a week, I think we\nshould be able to work something out\nfor Ysheva Harbor.
20	Wait, wait. Hang on a sec.\nThere's a problem.
21	Unfortunately, I don't have access\nto the kinda long-haul Titan ship\nyou'd need.
22	If you can provide the ship.\nI'll set up the shipping route.
23	If you want to buy a ship,\nyou should talk to Pookapoo\non Goldmouth Flight Deck.
24	If you'd rather rent, then\nyou want Umon in Gormott\nProvince.
25	Sounds like a lot of work...\nBut it's for a good cause, eh?\nHelping your home town and all that.
26	If you want to buy a ship,\nyou should talk to Pookapoo\non Goldmouth Flight Deck.
27	If you'd rather rent, then\nyou want Umon in Gormott\nProvince.
28	If anyone can do it, it's you!
qst103904_ms.json
1	What can I do you for?\nAfter delivery, are you?
2	Handling fees for Fonsett\nby way of Argentum?
3	Oh, you're talking about the delivery\nfrom Rex! That lad sure does send\nmoney home like a right good lad.
4	Listen, we run an honest business.\nWe got nothing to hide.
5	Port authority charges 3% to\nload goods onto the ship.
6	Then for large sums you pay another\n2% for an escort. After that, it's another\n2% to send it to Alba Cavanich.
7	So if you started with 88,200G...\nYou're looking at 82,166G\nheading for the capital.
8	What are you sending it to\nthe capital for?
9	There's no shipping lane\nfrom Torigoth to Leftheria.
10	There's not much that gets\nsent to Leftheria. Supply and\ndemand, boyo.
11	I would go ask the Nopon\ncourier in Mor Ardain about\nhis handling fees, if I were you.
12	You'll probably find him loading\ngoods at Port Anangham.
13	The fella's name is...um...\nthingumabob...
14	Everyone just calls him\n"boss" so I forget.
15	It would be a bit cheaper without\nthe port authority charges.
16	But that money goes towards\nwharf maintenance and hiring\nsupervisory staff. It's pretty vital.
qst103905_ms.json
1	Welcome, welcome!\nDo you have goods to send?\nCome to pick up goods?
2	Handling fee to send to Corinne?
3	Ah... Uh...\nBoss is out of office at moment!
4	Kebubu is only helping\nboss part-time. No idea\nabout fees or anything.
5	If friends find boss,\nhe can help with queries.
6	Uh...\nBoss is in Chansagh Wastes.\nMaybe in exposed pipes place.
7	Or warehouse at old factory site.
8	Boss is in Chansagh Wastes.\nMaybe in exposed pipes place.
9	Or warehouse at old factory site.
10	Best ask him query directly.
qst103906_ms.json
1	Doesn't look like that\nNopon boss is here.
2	That boss isn't here.
3	This Nopon boss fella\nis nowhere to be seen.
4	Boss! Are you here?\n...He not here.
5	There's not hide nor hair\nof any Nopon here.
qst103907_ms.json
1	There's no one here.
2	There isn't anyone here.
3	Is it just me, or is this place deserted?
4	Booooosss! Come out come out\nwherever you are! ...He not here.
5	There's no one here.
qst103908_ms.json
1	What? Whatwhatwhat?\nWhy you come back?
2	Many strong monsters out there, so\nKebubu felt sure you not go, or if you\ngo then you get squishy-smashed...
3	Ahhh! Don't angry, please!\nKebubu tell truth now!
4	Name of boss is...\nKebubu.
5	Sending fee is maybe teeny-weeny\nbit higher than friends would\nexpect, so Kebubu not want to say.
6	F-fee is...\n19%...
7	Courier business is tough\nto run out of Mor Ardain!
8	Soldiers require many\nbribes to smooth over\nbureaucratic hold-ups.
9	Then Kebubu feel bad about it, so\nsometimes soothe feelings with\nluxury spa package at hot spring.
10	If sum is 82,166G, then...\n66,554G get sent to Leftheria.
11	That whole truth!\nKebubu take no more than that.
12	But do not know cost of\ntransport from Leftheria\nport to Fonsett Village.
13	If head to Rigitte Harbor in\nLeftheria, there is old man\ncourier there called Sholto.
14	He can answer questions about monies.
15	They say "Nopon small so must dock\nat small jetty," even if ship is big.
16	But they not say that to\nArgentum Trade Guild ship...\nIt very unfair!
qst103909_ms.json
1	H-help me!\nShoo! Shoo!
qst103910_ms.json
1	You really saved my bacon...\nThanks, strangers.
2	I'm transporting goods between\nRigitte and Ysheva Harbor.
3	But there's some food or something\nin here, and once those blackguards\nget a whiff they don't let up.
4	So you want to know how much it\ncosts to get money to Fonsett?
5	Well, first the Ardainian ship\ndocks in the harbor.
6	Then the goods are sent through\nOrl Cloudway to Ysheva Harbor.
7	There are a lot of monsters in the\nCloud Sea, so I have to hire guards.
8	So lessee... I take 2,500G...and the\nguards are 1,700G each, there's\nthree of them, so...
9	If I get 66,554G, your Corinne will\nwind up receiving 58,954G.
10	You started with 90,000G?\nWhew. Tough break, kiddo.
11	If there were a direct shipping route to\nYsheva Harbor, there'd be fewer middle\nmen and it'd be cheaper, eh?
12	You'll help? That would be\nexcellent! Argentum produces\nsome really nice stuff.
13	But it's not like I have access to\nlong-haul Titan ships way out here.
14	Looks like I'll have to go begging\nto the Argentum Trade Guild.
15	If we can really do this,\nthe people of Fonsett\nare going to be very happy.
16	My current client is a\nbit of a stingy one.
17	So I couldn't afford to pay any\nbodyguards. I thought I'd be OK\non my own, but it turns out I wasn't.
18	H-help me!\nShoo! Shoo!
qst103911_ms.json
1	Have got details from\nArgentum Trade Guild.
2	Pookapoo can sell friends a\nlong-haul Titan ship!
3	Ship costs 300,000G and anchorage\nis 500G, so total cost is 300,500G.
4	Now you are proud owner of ship!
5	Pookapoo will register details\nwith Argentum Trade Guild.
6	Pookapoo wish you fair wind and\nfollowing clouds, friends!
7	This big purchase, so take\ntime to mull it over, friends.
8	Pay 300,500G?
9	Pay
10	Don't pay
qst103912_ms.json
1	You want rent boat to set up\nregular shipping service?
2	From Argentum to Fonsett?
3	That very impressive goal!\nUmon will lend boat.
4	...Obviously not for free.\nInitial cost 2,000G.
5	OK, 2,000G received.
6	Umon will send ship to\nArgentum Trade Guild.
7	Remember, if you break it,\nthen you pay for it!
8	Looks like friends are in for long\njourney, so please extra careful.
9	No money, no ship lendy!
10	Initial fee for lend\nboat is 2,000G.
11	Pay 2,000G?
12	Pay
13	Don't pay
qst103913_ms.json
1	I can't believe you got a ship, Rex.\nActually, I suppose I can.
2	Well, I'll set up the shipping\nroute as promised!\nNice work, guys.
3	Thanks!
4	Oh, by the way, if I send 90,000G\nusing the new route, how much would\nAuntie Corinne receive?
5	The handling fee between Argentum\nand Ysheva Harbor is set at 5%,
6	It's further than Gormott Province,\nyou see. An escort is pretty much\nessential, too, so it bumps up the price.
7	So you're looking at 85,500G\nonce it gets to Ysheva Harbor.
8	Fonsett itself is right by Ysheva Harbor\nso there shouldn't be any additional\nfees after that.
9	Wow, that's quite a difference to\nbefore! This shipping route was\nwell worth it.
10	Oh, and it'll be even easier for\nCorinne to send you her home\ncooking, won't it?
11	See?
12	Braised Cloud Sea Shark!
13	It's not even a day old!\nIt looks so good.
14	Great!\n...Oh, there was something\nI wanted to ask.
15	It would really help me out if you\ncould lend my guards a hand with\ntheir duties. Reckon you can do that?
16	No problem!
17	Fantastic! Cheers!

1	Well, this is a bit of a pickle.
2	Well, there's a bit of a problem with\nthe village's children, you see...
3	It's just that...well, as I'm sure you\nknow, the Praetorium of Indol was\ndestroyed in that great conflict.
4	And thanks to that, our Mark can't go\nto the Indoline Academy any more.
5	We don't have anywhere to send the\nchildren for a good education...
6	So I was thinking!
7	Maybe we could fix up this building\nthat nobody's using right now...
8	Round up some good teachers from\nall around Alrest...
9	And start a brand-new school\nright here in Fonsett!
10	Oh! Well, I'm happy to hear it.
11	First thing we've got to do is get the\nschool building in workable shape.
12	It's falling apart here and there\nafter years of disuse, you see.
13	You'll find a carpenter out back,\nname of Mason.
14	He's working out what needs to\nbe done. Could you lend him a hand?
15	Let's make this village a place where\nchildren can be proud to grow up!
16	I hope to see this become a place\nwhere children can learn, grow, and\nfoster the skills they'll need in life.
qst104202_ms.json
1	So it looks like the building repairs\nshould go just fine? Excellent!\nOn to the next phase!
2	We need to gather great teachers\nfrom across Alrest!
3	Language!\nFrom basic literacy through to detailed\nliterary analysis and composition...
4	Our children must be raised to enjoy\nrich communication with others!
5	Sciences!\nFrom the workings of everyday objects\nto the calculations used in business...
6	Our children should master all kinds of\nknowledge to widen their horizons!
7	History!\nNone of us would be here today were\nit not for the efforts of our ancestors.
8	By learning of the triumphs and failures\nof the past, our children will gain the\nwisdom to forge a brighter future!
9	I'm sorry to foist this all on you,\nbut I'd like you to use your judgment\nto find the most suitable candidates.
10	I'd like you to use your judgment to\nfind the most suitable candidates.
11	You've traveled many more places\nand met many more people than me.\nIf anyone can find us teachers, it's you.
12	We could always find teachers locally,\nbut I want to provide an education to\nmatch that of the Indoline Academy.
13	Perhaps one day, even children from\noutside could gather here in Fonsett\nin order to pursue a better education!
14	Fantastic!
15	So, where are these teachers\nyou've found?
16	Ah... They're all still making\npreparations to travel here?
17	Oh dear... I may have been a little\nhasty in my assumptions.
18	Well, when I heard you'd arrived,\nI thought you must have brought the\nnew teachers with you, you see.
19	So I already gathered the children\ntogether so we could have ourselves\nan inaugural lesson.
20	Now I feel a little silly...
21	Hey, I had a brainwave!\nPerhaps our very own Mr. Rex can\ngive the kids a little practice lesson!
22	He's the biggest success story this\nvillage has produced, after all!
23	I'll call the kids over, then!
qst104203_ms.json
1	It's time for Mr. Rex's teaching debut!
2	This may be just a practice lesson for\nthe kids, but it's also a chance to see\nhow much Rex has grown.
3	I still remember when he was just\na babe... Perhaps I should have called\nCorinne over to see this, too.
qst104204_ms.json
1	So you're all done with\nthe practice lesson, eh?
2	Perfect timing. Those teachers\nof yours just showed up, as well.
3	Now let's see...
4	It looks like you've gathered a fine\nselection of teachers to stimulate the\nvillage children's minds!
5	Thank you for all your efforts.\nYou've done a service to the children\nand to this whole village!
6	It can't have been an easy task.\nYou've earned this reward.
7	They certainly seem an...interesting\nbunch, but I'm sure they'll do just fine.
8	Thank you for all your efforts.\nYou've done a service to the children\nand to this whole village!
9	It's not much, but please take\nthis as thanks.
qst104205_ms.json
1	Eyup, pal!\nI'm racking my brains a bit here.
2	The building's not in the worst\nof shape, all things considered...
3	But if there's gonna be kids using it\nday in, day out, it could probably\ndo with being a bit more sturdy.
4	I dunno where we'd get our hands\non the materials for that, though...
5	Really?! You guys are the best!
6	Can I ask you to gather a few things\nright away, then? You can give them\nto the kids over there.
7	Mark needs some wood,\nKazuna needs decorations,\nand Kirk needs some ore.
8	They all offered to lend me a hand.\nSaid they wanted to help build their\nown new school - isn't that grand?
9	When I see passion like that, it makes\nme want to do the best job I can do!
10	Mark needs some wood,\nKazuna needs decorations,\nand Kirk needs some ore.
11	Once you've gathered enough,\njust let me know!
12	You gathered all the stuff?\nFantastic!
13	Then let's get straight to work!
14	Erm...
15	Well, actually, I can't start working\nright away just like that.
16	Why don't you go help the mayor\nwith something else while I get\neverything sorted here?
17	It feels so good to work on something\nworthwhile together!
18	A lesson from Mr. Rex...\nI feel lucky to witness such a rare sight!
19	Finally even the teachers are here...\nThe mayor's dream has come true!
20	I hope all the kids'll study hard and\ngrow up into super smart people!
qst104206_ms.json
1	I was so disappointed when I heard\nthat Indol was gone.
2	I was just getting ready to start\nattending the Academy there...
3	So I'll do everything I can to help!\nI'll even do heavy lifting!
4	Did you bring me some wood?\nI'll take whatever you've got!
5	I still need more wood,\nso keep it coming!
6	Nice, that should be all the\nwood I need! Thanks!
7	I'm still disappointed I won't be able to\ngo to the famous Indoline Academy...
8	But hey, it'll be way more fun starting\nup a new school here instead!
9	Mason knows how to make the most\nof all kinds of different materials!\nHe's pretty amazing...
qst104207_ms.json
1	Oh, hey! Are you guys helping\nout with the school too?
2	Yay! Let's make it the best school\nin all of Alrest!
3	I'm doing the decorating!\nI need fabrics, musical instruments,\nartwork and books, that kind of stuff!
4	Did you bring anything I could\nuse to decorate?
5	I'm gonna keep adding decorations\nuntil the whole school looks beautiful!\nSo keep bringing me stuff, OK?
6	I think that should do it!\nThanks!
7	Ooh, which decoration should I use\nwhere? This is so much fun!
8	Making a school is hard. But it's fun!\nMore fun than going to school, actually.
qst104208_ms.json
1	D'you think we can really make\na whole school by ourselves?
2	I just need ore. Doesn't matter what\ntype, apparently. Have you got any?
3	Mmm...I don't think I've got as much\nas Mason wanted yet. D'you think this\nschool will ever really be ready?
4	I think that should be enough, from\nwhat Mason said. Thanks!
5	Now I've got all the materials,\nthis is actually pretty exciting.\nI hope this school turns out well!
6	Apparently we've gotta crush all the\nores, then reform them together.
7	Mason's such a pro at this stuff!
qst104209_ms.json
1	Oh, hello again!
2	Would you listen to this?\nMy book was a smashing success!
3	I released a companion volume to help\nsell my original book about flowers.\nWhat do you think it was about?
4	No, not dashing gentlemen, actually.\nI wrote a story about beautiful ladies\nbased on all the different flowers!
5	It was a huge hit with male readers.\nWe just can't publish enough copies\nto meet demand!
6	A riveting tale of elegant gentlemen and\nthe passionate friendships they share...
7	That's what everyone's calling it!\nThe female reader base just can't\nget enough of the heated drama!
8	People have started asking me when\nI'm going to bring out a sequel...
9	A certain mental state is required to\ncreate. But I still want to espouse the\njoys of the written word to the world!
10	Oh, you're recruiting a language\nteacher for a school in Fonsett Village?\nThat sounds fabulous!
11	It's so important to immerse yourself\nin beautiful literature from a young age!
12	I'd make sure all my pupils grow up\ninto the kind of people who can fall\nmadly in love with fictional characters!
13	Oh, but are you sure?\nMe, a teacher?
14	Invite Mesulia to teach in Fonsett?
15	Invite
16	Think it over
17	All right, then! I'll do my best\nto teach those kids good!
18	I guess I'd better head home right\naway and start preparing to leave!
19	I might be a little late arriving, I have\nto gather up all the novels I might be\nable to use as textbooks!
20	Oh, OK then...\nWell, I'm always willing if you\ndon't find anyone else!
21	Oh, did you make your mind up\nabout the language teacher thing?
22	Did you make your mind up about that\nlanguage teacher thing? Oh, you found\nsomeone else? Shame, shame...
23	Naturally, I want to surpass my last\nwork, but the pressure is burdensome\nand the blank page terrifies me.
qst104210_ms.json
1	Thank you so much for inviting me!\nI'm thrilled to come all the way out\nhere to Fonsett Village.
2	I hope I can teach the kids all kinds of\nthings through the medium of literature!
qst104211_ms.json
1	Tender grass of green\nCrisp your texture underfoot\n'Neath the whisp'ring wind.
2	O fair Gormott, many are thy charms:\nSunlight like a mother's sweet caress,\nBranches stronger than a father's arms!
3	Oh, my apologies. I was merely\nexpressing my love for the natural\nbeauty of Gormott through poetry.
4	I wish only that the children in the city\nwould weave beautiful verses about\ntheir homeland also.
5	But alas, it seems they are all more\nconcerned with enjoying the present\nmoment than pursuing the literary arts.
6	A teaching post in Fonsett Village?\nFor me?
7	Oh, frabjous day!\nThe voices of the Titans call out to me!\nI drift upon the currents of the clouds!
8	Ah, but there's just one problem.\nThe shackles of my personal debt\nbind me in place and I cannot leave!
9	Not unless I collect 7,500G...\nOh, what am I to do...?
10	Pay 7,500G?
11	Pay
12	Don't pay
13	I suppose nobody would want to\nemploy a teacher who puts off his work\nto indulge in his hobbies...
14	A teacher of language... The very\nnotion of it sets my heart on fire!
15	But I cannot simply neglect\nthe fact that my loan of 7,500G\nremains unpaid...
16	Oh! Like a star of hope from Elysium,\na not-so-modest sum of money\nappears before me!
17	Now I can settle my debts here and\ntravel to Fonsett Village to start anew!
18	I'll get my things together and\nhead there right away!
19	If I don't pay my debts soon, my boss\nis going to kill me... I suppose I'd better\nstart scraping some cash together...
20	Oh, if only there were a cup to catch\nmy wisdom, knowledge and erudition\nas it o'erflows...
qst104212_ms.json
1	Long-forgotten shores\nThrough a house of learning ring\nVoices of young souls.
2	The mayor's passion has sparked my\ninspiration! I will give my all to foster\nlinguistic greatness in these children!

1	Legendary hero...shining princess...\nteensy fairy...
2	Meh-meh! Lapupu engrossed in world\nof fiction!
3	Lapupu still only littlepon, and\nnot really sparkly-sparkly princess...
4	In fiction, Lapupu can become anyone!\nLike swishy-swashy hero or fluffy-puff\nprincess or zip-a-zip fairy!
5	But, becoming someone else make it\neasier to understand others, show\nkindness. Lapupu want all to know this.
6	Lapupu teach language at Fonsett?\nOoh...Lapupu not sure.
7	Mamapon always say Nopon should\nfollow heart and live free, so she\nprobably not object, but still...
8	Listen. There something Lapupu really\nwant. Mamapon always say Lapupu is\ntoo young for that, but Lapupu needs it.
9	Is cosmetics and accessories.\nImportant possessions for any\nprincess.
10	Lapupu want to become more like\nprincess even outside of book.
11	That why Lapupu need 7,500G, to go\non fairytale shopping spree!
12	Pay 7,500G?
13	Pay
14	Don't pay
15	Oh well... Lapupu just have to buy\ncosmetics for self when older.
16	Maybe by then Lapupu already\nmore like sparkly-sparkly princess?
17	Lapupu need 7,500G to transform\nwith princess makeover!
18	Yay-yay! Lapupu go shopping now!\nBecome like sparkly-sparkly princess!
19	Once Lapupu done with shopping\nspree, Lapupu go straight to Fonsett.
20	Lapupu quite excited to travel.\nNever been on adventure\noutside of book before!
21	Bye-bye then!
22	Oh, friends found different teacher?\nLapupu tried being teacher in book.\nWas lots of fun.
23	...Actually, Lapupu know that become\na fluffy-puff princess in real life would\nbe very convenient.

1	Roots... Roots...
2	Precious! Roots! Search!
3	Fancy seeing you here.\nDid you want something?
4	A teacher? Me?
5	In Fonsett Village?\nHere?
6	It's quite an interesting place, Leftheria.
7	Paths in between the islands\nlook quite like roots.
8	All right. I'll teach the kids.\nOnce I finish my work.
9	Bring me a rare root.\nFrom Spirit Crucible Elpys.\nThen I'll help.
10	Find me a Colla Carrot.\nFrom a remote area of Elpys.
11	Villagers told me not to go alone.\nSaid there were monsters.
12	You lot'll be fine though.\nGood luck.
13	Look for a beautiful lake.\nThat's where it is.
14	Make sure you get it right.\nIt's a Colla Carrot. A root.
15	A Colla Carrot!\nGood job. I'll teach the kids.
16	Let me go back to my lab.\nGotta make preparations.\nThen I'll head to the village.
17	Bye now.

1	Mih-hih-hih!\nPower of science!
2	Friends interested in research\nof Quiqui?
3	Quiqui experiment with ores and herbs\nand things. Mash up, mix together, set\non fire. See what happen.
4	Take large amount of intelligence.\nMust measure smallest change in\nquantities or procedure.
5	Someday Quiqui make shiny gold\nor medicine for curing all illness or\nsomething like that.
6	Quiqui short on research funds though.
7	Not even having research lab of own.\nThat why Quiqui have to continue\nresearch here.
8	No research grant, so not enough\nmoney to pay fee.
9	Quiqui want proper job using\nintelligence and abilities to earn money!\nFund better research environment!
10	Friends looking for science teacher\nat Fonsett Village?
11	Quiqui could do teaching in between\nresearching... But are friends sure?
12	Invite Quiqui to teach in Fonsett?
13	Invite
14	Think it over
15	All right! Quiqui do teaching!
16	Not much to take, so should not\ntake long to get ready!
17	Oh, but Quiqui not have moneys for\nfast ship. Might take while to get there\ntaking cheap ships.
18	Well, Quiqui always ready\nif friends make decision.
19	Mih-hih-hih!\nPower of science!
20	Friends back to invite Quiqui for\nteacher again? Quiqui could probably\nfit teaching in between researching...
21	Mih-hih-hih!\nPower of science!
22	Quiqui run out of moneys for things\nto burn in experiments. Need to find\nproper job and earn moneys...
23	Quiqui experiment with ores and herbs\nand things. Mash up, mix together, set\non fire. See what happen.
qst104218_ms.json
1	Mih-hih-hih!\nTime for experiments!
2	Hm? Lessons?\nQuiqui do those a bit too.
qst104219_ms.json
1	You lot again, eh?\nAlways a pleasure to see you.
2	I'm still the same as ever.\nJust researching ancient things\naround this village.
3	I've learned so many things here.\nWhat I'd really like is to share the\nwonders of history with the locals...
4	But they never seem to have time for\nan old man's ramblings. Too busy with\nmissions and whatnot.
5	Still, it's not as though I can just\ntoddle on back to Mor Ardain...\nSo I'm in a bit of a fix.
6	A job teaching history to children?\nIn Fonsett Village?
7	If I recall correctly, there is a rather\nintriguing ancient artifact there.\nThey call it the "Village Guardian".
8	If you would have me, I would be\nmost happy to take up the post.
9	Invite Alisdeigh to teach in Fonsett?
10	Invite
11	Think it over
12	Then there's no time to lose!
13	I'll see about getting together all my\nthings, then head straight for Fonsett.\nThat sound all right?
14	Ah, well that's a shame.
15	Perhaps the mercenary folk here\nwill listen to me if I just spark their\ninterest a little more...
16	Were you still interested in offering\nme that teaching position? I'd be glad\nto take it up.
17	So, about that history teaching\nposition... Ah, it has already been\nfilled, has it? A shame, a shame...
18	But there's no real good opportunity\nfor that. And even if there was, I bet\nsomeone else would've jumped on it...
qst104220_ms.json
1	History teaches us not only the\nsuccesses of our forebears, but\nalso their mistakes.
2	I will do my best to ensure the young\nfolk here are able to look to the past\nfor guidance in times of difficulty.

15	Not sure where to find though...
16	OK then. Tortor keep searching for\nAncient Salvaging Suit by self.
17	Friends still want Tortor\nbecome teacher?
18	Where to find Ancient Salvaging Suit...\nMaybe in place nobody usually go?
19	Friends travel lots. Maybe salvage in\nobscure places somewhere out there?
20	Tortor really not know.\nMaybe just wait and see...
21	Ohhh! Ancient Salvaging Suit!\nIt so...so...so big!
22	How anyone salvage wearing big\nbulky thing like this?
23	But there must be reason behind\nbig size of suit!
24	Once Tortor reach Fonsett Village,\nTortor investigate ancient suit history!
25	And, possibly even teach lessons, if\nTortor can find the time in between\nmore important activities!
26	Anyways! Tortor go pack up salvaging\ngear and things, then head to Fonsett!
27	Friends find history teacher?\nThat good news.
28	But friends interested in history very\nhard to find! Rare like delicious Armu\nsteaks...

1	Rex was teaching lesson\nabout salvage?!
2	As fellow salvager, Tortor would\nhave liked to see that.
qst104223_ms.json
1	Ding-dong!\nMr. Rex! I've got a question!
2	I found a piece of rock near the\nVillage Guardian the other day\nwith this weird old writing on it!
3	Can you read this squiggly stuff?
4	Of course! I'm pretty good at\nreading ancient writing.
5	Wow, Mr. Rex! You're amazing!\nD'you think I could learn to\nread this stuff too someday?
6	You're a really hard worker,\nMark, so I bet you could learn\nto read it if you tried.
7	All right! I'll study hard to see\nif I can read what's on that stone!
8	Right, next up is Kazuna's question.
9	Squiggly writing, huh...\nThat might be a bit tricky.
10	Oh, really?\nI'll try asking the history teacher\nwhen they get here, then!
11	You're a hard worker, Mark, so\nyou could probably learn to read\nit yourself if you tried.
12	Right, next up is Kazuna's question.
13	You're not Mr. Rex! I thought Mr. Rex\nwas going to give us a lesson?
14	You should go answer\nKazuna's question next.
15	You should go answer\nKirk's question next.
qst104224_ms.json
1	Ding-dong ding-dong!\nHey, Mr. Rex!
2	So the other day, we all tried\nto go down to the beach...
3	But there was a big rock washed up\nin the way, and we couldn't get past!
4	All three of us tried pushing it together,\nbut it didn't move an inch!
5	In the end, Mason and some other\nvillagers helped us get it out of the way.
6	But would you be able to move\na big rock like that all on your own?
7	Of course! I can break through\nall kinds of rocks, no problem.
8	Wowwww! You'd smash them right up?!\nI'd love to try that!
9	Don't go trying anything dangerous,\nnow. Corinne'll be really mad if you\nget yourself hurt.
10	OK! I'll be careful not to get hurt!
11	Is that all you wanted to ask, Kazuna?\nI guess Kirk's next up, then.
12	It would probably be easier to\nbreak it than move it, but a rock\nthat big might be tough...
13	Oh, I see... I guess even you'd have\nto ask Mason for help, huh?
14	Is that all you wanted to ask, Kazuna?\nI guess Kirk's next up, then.
15	You're not Rex!\nC'mon, Rex, teach me stuff!
16	C'mon, go answer Mark's question!
17	C'mon, go answer Kirk's question!
qst104225_ms.json
1	Bzzzzzt!\nA question for Mr. Rex!
2	Can you find all kinds of cool treasure\nin the Cloud Sea really easily?!
3	I sure can! I've salvaged so much,\nI could probably find treasure with\nmy eyes closed at this point.
4	Wow! I wanna see you salvaging\nsometime, Mr. Rex!
5	Well, it wouldn't be that easy.\nI'd probably have to salvage quite a lot\nof times to find the really good stuff.
6	Oh, I see.\nI always thought you just dive in and\nbring up amazing treasure every time!
7	I've never seen you actually salvaging!\nYou should show me sometime!
8	You're not the teacher.\nRex is the teacher.
9	Go answer Mark's question, OK?
10	Go answer Kazuna's question, OK?
qst104226_ms.json
1	Right, I think that wraps it up for\neveryone's questions. I guess I'll give\nyou a salvaging demonstration now!
2	Hey Mr. Rex! I got another question!
3	Which girl are you sweet on?
4	Wha-?!
5	Ooh, I wanna know too!\nAre you going out with someone?
6	Me too, me too! I heard Corinne\nworrying about whether you'd\nget married!
7	Ooh, are you getting married,\nMr. Rex?! When? When?
8	Yaaaaay! A wedding!\nCongrats, Mr. Rex!
9	Congratulations, Mr. Rex!
10	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]H-hold on, all of you!\nYou're getting way ahead of yourselves!
11	A-anyway, we're going to do\na salvaging demonstration!
12	Everyone come with me\nto Messet Point!
13	Ahaha! Mr. Rex's face is bright red!
14	He's still such a kid...
15	He's innocent, that's all!
16	Urgh...
17	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]They'll have to respect me when\nthey see my salvaging skills in action!
qst104227_ms.json
1	All right, now I'm going to show\nyou all how a pro salvager works,\nso pay close attention!
2	You all don't have any salvaging\ngear yet, so we can't let you try\nit out for yourselves today...
3	But watching how it's done will\nprepare you for when you do\nstart salvaging for yourselves!
4	I've never seen a real salvager\nat work before!
5	Aren't those air cylinder things heavy?\nWon't you just sink?
6	Bring us back lots of treasure, Mr. Rex!
7	Sure thing! Leave it to me!
qst104228_ms.json
1	Aaaahhhh!
2	It's a monster!
3	Is this the treasure?
4	Watch out, it's going to attack!
qst104229_ms.json
1	Well, um...
2	That...was definitely a monster.
3	Not treasure.
4	It was scary...
5	So...as you just saw, sometimes\nsalvagers can haul up monsters\ninstead of treasure!
6	Everyone make sure you're fully\nprepared and equipped with weapons\nwhen you salvage for yourselves!
7	OK, Mr. Rex!
8	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Did he mess up...?
9	Yes, Mr. Rex!
10	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]He totally messed up...
11	I'll remember that!
12	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Mr. Rex messed up...
13	Urkk...
14	W...well, that's the end of my lesson!\nNext time, there should be brand new\nteachers here to instruct you!
15	Make sure to be nice to them.\nNo being rude or playing tricks, OK?
16	All right, class dismissed!
17	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Did I just make a proper fool\nof myself...?

1	Welcome to the Smaia Clinic.\nAh, it's you lot again!
2	I'm afraid Doctor Smaia isn't\nin the clinic right now. Again.
3	Was there something urgent\nyou wanted her for?
4	You want to recruit Doctor Smaia\nto teach in a school?!
5	Well, I suppose you would\ndefinitely have to discuss that\nwith her in person.
6	I'm not sure if Doctor Smaia will be\ninterested in teaching children...
7	After all, she even treats me as\nmore of an odd-jobs man than\nan actual apprentice...
8	Doctor Smaia accepted your invitation\nto a teaching post?!
9	I can hardly believe it...\nDoctor Smaia? Teaching children?
10	I wonder what will happen\nto this clinic...
11	I'll have to discuss it with her\nwhen she comes back. Maybe\nthis could be my big opportunity?
12	Have Smaia come as a teacher?
13	Hire her
14	Think it over
15	This time she's on a trip to\nFonsett Village in Leftheria.
16	Apparently there's some kind of\nmedicinal plant she's looking for in\na place called Spirit Crucible Elpys.
17	But I don't know where that place is,\nso you all would have to help look...
18	After that...\nWell, if you're lucky, she might\nfulfill your request.
19	I don't know if Doctor Smaia will\naccept the post or not.
20	Perhaps it would just turn out to be a\nfool's errand. Yes, it'd be wise to think\nit over before going to the trouble.
21	I'll be sure to let Doctor Smaia know\nthat you asked after her when she\nreturns.
qst104231_ms.json
1	Wow, you dive into the Cloud Sea\nfrom this high up?
qst104232_ms.json
1	Those air cylinder things are so heavy...\nYou will be able to get back up, right?\nYou won't just sink?

2	こいつを見てくれよ\n面白いかたちしてっだろ？
3	これを高く売りたいんだ\nできれば1万G以上で！
4	――ああ\n売値がそんな高くつかないことくらいは\n俺もわかってるさ
5	でも　オレはどうしてもこれを\n高値で売りたいんだ！
6	オレたち難民は少ない配給で\nどうにかその日を生きてんだ
7	ところが最近はさらに量が減ってきてな――\n一日一食　二食っつー日も珍しくない
8	腹が空いてしょうがねぇだろうに\n妻も娘も文句ひとつ言わずに耐えてんだ
9	そんなアイツらにたまにはうまいもんを\n腹いっぱい食わせてやりたい
10	そのためにはこいつを高く売って\n資金を得なけりゃならねぇ
11	それに幸い\n高く買い取ってくれる店のアテもあるんだ
12	アーケディアの港には夜にだけ開店していて\nどんな物でも高く買い取ってくれる――\nという店があるらしい
13	その店の名はマゴゴナムというんだ\nそこでこいつを売ってきてくれるか？
14	助かる！\nそれじゃあ頼んだぜ
15	どうだい　あれは売れたか？
16	――そうか　まだか\n無茶な頼みだということは承知している\nでもどうか1万Gで売ってきてくれ
17	どうだい　あれは売れたか？
18	何！？　12000G！？\nそんなに高く売れるとは――\nアンタらに頼んで正解だったな！
19	助かったぜ　ありがとよ\n2000Gは礼として受け取ってくれ
20	いくら困窮してるとはいえ\n恩人に礼を欠くわけにはいかねぇ
21	俺がアンタに頼んだ一万Gはここにある\nそれで十分だ
22	ああそれと\n良かったらこれも受け取ってくれ
23	何に使えるかはサッパリわかんねぇが――\nほんとにありがとな\nこの恩は絶対に忘れねぇよ
qst104302_ms.json
1	らっしゃい！\nんん？　あんた　初めて見る顔だな
2	まあ一見さんお断りってわけじゃねぇから\n追い返すなんてこたぁしねぇさ
3	んじゃま　早速仕事といこうじゃねぇか\nまず先にあんたのランクを確認させてくれ
4	急に黙り込んじまってどうした？\n何？　ランクについて知らない？
5	それも知らずにここへ来たってのか！\n悪いが　それじゃあ買取の交渉はできねぇ
6	あんま大声じゃ言えねぇんだがよ\n俺んとこの店はランク付けされた\n一部のサルベージャーしか利用できねぇんだ
7	サルベージ品を売りてぇなら\nまずはアヴァリティアで\nランク付けをしてもらってこい
8	ここは特級サルベージャーだけが\n立ち入りを許されてる店だ
9	あんたが特級になってまたここに来りゃ\nその時は正式な客として相手をしてやるぜ
10	なんだ　まだ特級になっていないのか？
11	俺と交渉したいなら\nまずはランクを上げて来い\n話をするのはそれからだぜ
12	らっしゃい！\nおう　あんたか！
13	どうだい　特級にはなれたのかい？
14	ほほう　それならお客さんだな！\nで？　売りたい物はなんだ？
15	――ふむ　こいつか\nなかなかいい状態だな\nこれなら12000Gで買い取るぜ！
16	何　そう驚くことじゃないさ\n誰がサルベージしてきたのかというのも\n物の価値を上げる要素のひとつなのさ
17	というわけでこいつを買い取らせてもらうぜ
18	いやいや\nこちらこそありがとな
19	また売りたいもんをサルベージしたら\nウチに持ってきてくれや
20	何か新しいもの見つけてきたかい？（仮）

4	――――
5	う　ううっ――\nしょうがないもね　500Gで手を打つも\nだからそんな目で見ないでほしいも
6	ではでは気を取り直して話を進めるも
7	サルベージャーのランクは\nきみが今までサルベージして取得した物の\n総合価値で決まるも
8	まずは初級から始めるも\nサルベージしてすごい物がたくさん取れたら\n格付けしに来るも
9	ただ毎回てまちんとして500Gかかるから\nそれなりに見つけてから来た方が\nいいかもしれないも
10	それと\nランクはひとつずつしか上がらないから\nあしからずも
11	キササに格付けチェックされるも？
12	支払い文：格付けチェックには\n手数料500G必要だも
13	リョーカイも\n格付けしてもらいたくなったら\nいつでもキササのところに来るも
14	リョーカイも！\nさあさあバシバシ格付けするも！
15	きみのサルベージャーランクは――
16	初級も\nまだまだひよっこだも！
17	中級も\nひよっこから見習いに昇級も！
18	上級も！\nようやくここまできたも\nイタダキはすぐソコも！
19	おめでとう　特級も！\nこれからもバリバリ働くも！

1	Sniff-sniff, sniff-sniff...\nFriend have smell of strong fighter!\nIs friend very strong?
2	Sorry... Snififi should not sniff-sniff\nfriends before even say hello.
3	Snififi have very good nose. Never make\nany mistake with smell before!
4	And nose of Snififi say, Snififi should\nopen new shop in Temperantia!
5	But nobody have shop there yet.\nSo Snififi not know of good travel route.
6	Snififi think nose alone probably not\nenough to keep fellow merchant safe.
7	So was sniffing around to find strong\nperson to use as bodyguard!
8	Snififi sniff-sniff 100 people, and\nyou smell strongest out of all 100!
9	Please, friend! Help Snififi set up\nshop in Temperantia!
10	Yay! Thank friend much!
11	Snififi will wait on Overlook Hill\nin Temperantia then! Come quick!

7	This too soon for celebrating.
8	Sniff-sniff, sniff-sniff...\nSnififi catch smell of strong monsters!
9	Is Amman Balgas!\nVery scary monster!\nProbably gobble Snififi up!
10	If friends defeat three of monster,\nSnififi probably able to secure safe\npath to destination.
11	Good luck friends!
12	Snififi will watch friends from safe\ndistance, and make dash for it as\nsoon as it look safe!
13	Please defeat three of\nAmman Balgas.
14	At instant of defeat, Snififi and fellow\nmerchants will dash to destination!

2	Good job friends!\nEveryone make it across safely!
3	Now is time to start selling stuffs\nto Ardainian milita...
4	Sniff-sniff... Sniff-sniff...\nUh-oh. This not good.
5	Snififi smell same scent as products\nwe brought coming from all around!
6	Are products that we bring already\nsupplied as standard by military?!\nWe not sell anything at this rate!
7	Meh-meh... Meh-meh-meh...\nSnififi know! Must get new product\nlineup here in Temperantia!
8	Collect things that seem useful from\naround here, and make into product!
9	Friends very kind.\nSnififi maybe start crying...
10	OK. Please find Snififi any useful\nmaterials from Temperantia!
11	Just need enough materials to be\nable to start up business!
12	Snififi will be waiting then!
13	Friends bring Snififi useful\nTemperantia materials?
14	Still needing more materials to start\nup shop! Snififi wait right here!
15	Please bring Metal Brooch for Snififi.\nVery popular item with soldiers.
16	Snififi just need 10 in total.\nGood luck with searching!
17	Sniff-sniff... Sniff-sniff...\nIs that smell of rare treasure\nSnififi can only sell here?!
18	Ah, Metal Brooches!\nSnififi still not sure why these\nso valuable.
19	But if soldiers have demand for them,\nis job of Nopon to provide supply!
20	Now Snififi have perfect lineup for\ninitial shop opening!
21	By the way, where friends find\nthose brooches?
22	At coast just nearby?\nThanks for info!
23	No need for worry. Snififi collect\ntreasure using most covert sneaking\ntechniques! Monsters never know!
24	Thanks, friends, for all of helping!\nPlease take this as thanks!
qst104504_ms.json

5	This should be enough for setting\nup good lineup to open shop with!\nThanks friends much!
6	...Except...there one more problem.\nMaybe friends can help.
7	Current lineup of products enough for\ndecent opening. Probably able to make\nlittle bit of money. Buuuuut...
8	Lineup still lacking in impact.\nNeed key item that will catch\neye of customer!
9	So Snififi think, should try to get hands\non Metal Brooch. Is apparently very\npopular item with soldiers around here!
10	Snififi never heard of Metal Brooch\nbefore, so not sure why valuable...
11	Snififi tried asking soldiers for details,\nbut they not telling. Say is much too\ndangerous for Nopon to collect.
12	Thanks, friends, for help!\n10 Metal Brooch should be enough!\nSoldiers can't stop talking about them!

2	Hmm? What're you after?\nOh right, the Metal Brooches\nI told that Nopon about.
3	Yeah, those tend to get washed up\non the shore near here, the one with\na view of Triedge Isle.
4	The cool thing about them is, you can\nuse them as the ultimate piece in the\nDuelling Kingdoms board game.
5	It's a local rule around here,\nnot something official.
6	As anyone can see, there isn't much\ncivilization here on Temperantia, so\nwe're starved for things to do.
7	The board games we brought with\nus are one of the few forms of\nentertainment we have.
8	But we'd get bored just playing them\nover and over, so we started adding\nnew rules to keep things interesting.
9	Anyway, if those Nopon do start\nselling Metal Brooches, I reckon\nthey'll sell like nobody's business.
10	But there are nasty monsters on that\ncoast where they wash up, so I told\nthe Nopon not to go looking.
11	It'd be a right shame all round\nif they came all the way out here\njust to become monster chow.
12	You seem to be able to take care of\nyourselves, so by all means head down\nto that coast and have a look around.
13	You can find Metal Brooches on\nthe coast just nearby.
14	They're a pretty hot commodity\namong the soldiers here right now.\nWe'll pay good money for them!

2	Is something wrong, ma'am?
3	I beg your pardon?
4	Ah, forgive me.\nMy name is Dromarch.
5	You looked somewhat troubled, so\nI couldn't help but inquire.
6	Is that so? Well, I don't know why\nI'm surprised. We beasts are always\nmore in tune than humans are.
7	My name is Sophora.
8	These ships are bound for Torigoth\nin Gormott Province.
9	They carry people who see no good\nfuture for Mor Ardain and seek to\nescape the capital.
10	These are uncertain times...\nSo it goes.
11	My Driver, Oswalt, is a Gormotti who\nhas been chosen to act as an\nintermediary for the refugees.
12	We came to the capital after he\nwas scouted by an imperial recruiter\nand awoke me from my Core.
13	But Oswalt has a gentle soul, not meant\nfor war. He won't even complain to the\nshopkeeper when an apple is moldy.
14	I do wonder if he will be able to\neffectively bring together the\nArdainians and Gormotti.
15	If he's as kind as you say, then\nI'd say there is no problem.
16	My Driver is also from Gormott.
17	We travel with an Ardainian\nbut the two of them get along\njust fine.
18	That's wonderful! I hope we can do as\ngood a job of fostering cooperation\nbetween the two peoples!
19	Everyone, I must confess I am a little\nworried for her... Well, for the people\non the boat as well.
20	Would you mind if we\nmade sure they were all right?
21	You have my thanks.
22	Are you quite sure?\nHow marvelously generous!
23	The boat should be leaving\nany moment now.
24	We shall be docking at the Torigoth\nRelay Base in Gormott Province.\nCan I ask you to meet us there?
25	Sounds good, ma'am.\nWe shall see you there.

7	Would you mind checking for me?\nIt'd be a weight off my mind!
8	I hope it's just run-of-the-mill delays\nand nothing more serious...
9	There's been an increase lately in the\nnumber of people leaving the capital.

4	You didn't happen to see another\nTitan ship on your way here by\nany chance, did you?
5	Oh. Dammit.\nAs soon as I arrived in Leftheria,\nthe weather turned sour.
6	And then, just my luck, we got\nattacked by Cloud Sea monsters\nand I lost the others.
7	I want to go look for them,\nbut I lost Sophora along with\nthe ship so I can't really fight.
8	You'll help?\nOh man, that would be amazing.
9	I spoke to someone from Fonsett and\nthey said there are no Ardainian ships\nbetween here and the Cloud Ridge.
10	I know Sophora can take care of\nherself, but I'm worried about the\nother people on board the ship...
11	Some people fight and win even\nthough they're not Drivers.
12	And here I am, can't fight\nunless I have Sophora...
13	You found them?!\nSophora... She's all right?\nWhat a relief!
14	The ship got stuck in the Cloud Sea?
15	Could you tell me exactly where?

3	That was a close shave.\nThank you for your assistance.
4	Why did you decide to fight alone?
5	Without a Driver, you mean?\nIt was rather reckless of me.
6	Tell me, Dromarch. Do you never\nwish that your form was something\ncloser to human?
7	What do you mean, ma'am?
8	If you were shaped like a human,\nyou could hold a weapon.
9	You could provide first aid\nto injured people.
10	Not being able to use tools of any\nkind... It frustrates me, Dromarch.
11	You have a kind soul, Sophora.
12	I had not considered\nsuch things before.
13	How should I follow up?
14	We can let people ride on our backs
15	We can comfort people
16	Well, the advantage of this form is that\nwe can let people ride on our backs.
17	My Driver is awfully big. I wonder\nif I'd be able to carry him...
18	My Driver Nia always says that\ngalloping along with the wind in her\nface makes her feel truly alive.
19	Besides, we are much stronger\nthan humans! A heavy load is\nno burden for us.
20	Oi, who you calling heavy?
21	Ah, no-\nI did not mean to imply that you\nwere heavy, my lady.
22	You know, one of the advantages of\na form like ours is that we can\nprovide great comfort to people.
23	If I was shaped like a human male, and\nNia found my appearance distasteful,\nwe couldn't be as close as we are now.
24	That is true...
25	If I were a human woman, Oswalt\nwouldn't be able to brush my fur as he\ndoes now. Women make him nervous.
26	Thank you, Dromarch, for\nhelping me see that this\nform isn't so bad after all.
27	I'm happy I could be of assistance.
28	Will you return to the ship?
29	You have injured people to tend to.
30	We will pass word of your safety\nto your Driver in Ysheva Harbor.
31	Um, Dromarch?
32	Thank you.\nYou have been most kind.
33	I will see you later at the Torigoth\nRelay Base...
34	No, actually, would you be so\nkind as to meet me directly at\nthe Mor Ardain Consulate?
35	Of course, ma'am.
36	Then farewell for now.

1	大変だ　助けよう(仮)
2	Everyone, please calm down-
3	This is way more people than\nyou led on you were going to be!\nWhat are you playin' at?
4	There was a sudden influx of\npeople wanting to board the\nship just before it departed...
5	Don't go making out it was our fault!
6	Did you or did you not tell us that\nTorigoth would be able to handle\na few extra people?
7	Well, I mean, I...\nI just knew that the people from\nTorigoth were kind, so...
8	You're one of them who went and\ngot themselves scouted, is it?
9	This town not good enough for you,\neh? Had to go to the capital and\nbe a good little slave for the bigwigs?
10	You know the trouble Mor Ardain's\nput us through, but you still go\nlapping at their boots.
11	The cost of food's going to go right\nup. We're all going to starve.
12	I don't think-
13	Berating your countryman like that?\nJust what I'd expect from Gormotti.
14	If you've got something to say to me,\nboyo, you can say it straight!
15	Daffydd, these arseholes can live\non our Titan over my dead body!
16	P-please just calm down...
17	Just whose side are you on anyway?
18	Oh, um, well...\nLook, just stop fighting, please!
19	And who's fault is it that\nwe're fighting, by you?
20	You've really made a pig's ear\nof this intermediary business, boy.
21	Forgive my intrusion but Oswalt\nis not at fault here.
22	An animal Blade? Did you really need\nto resonate with this piece of rubbish\njust to pretend you're an Ardainian?
23	How could you-
24	I can't let that slide.
25	Dromarch!
26	An insult to our friends is\nan insult to us.
27	I had thought that if it looked like\npeople were going to get hurt,\nI would step in and help.
28	But your words have even\nmy calm blood boiling.
29	Maybe my water powers will\nhelp you cool off a little!

2	Ugh...my head...
3	Is everyone all right?
4	Of course. My friends are\nnot to be trifled with.
5	Right then, how shall we proceed?
6	There must be a wise proverb that fits...
7	"Yesterday's foe can be today's friend"
8	"He who does not work, shall not eat"
9	One only has to look at our\nparty to see the truth of that.
10	Rex is from Leftheria.\nTora is a Nopon.\nZeke here hails from Tantal.
11	And of course...\nThe Lady Mòrag is an Ardainian, and\nmy Driver Nia is Gormotti.
12	They were formerly bitter foes but\nnow are the fastest of friends.
13	This is all very stirring, boyo,\nbut you lot are you lot. We're-
14	Mummy, let's go home.\nHe doesn't want us here.
15	Tucha...
16	Don't be mean to them, Da.\nThey look sad.
17	You came from far away, right?\nWould you like to try a Meaty Carrot?\nI growed them myself!
18	Really?\nThanks!
19	Lavi, girl...
20	Leave it to children to demonstrate\nthe flexibility that adults lack.
21	Someday, these children\nwill have no home.
22	I'm fair sorry.\nI didn't think about how terrible it\nmust be to leave your home like that.
23	Me too.\nI forgot that we've been eating\nyour food for years.
24	Perhaps now we can move forward?
25	That's right!\nThese people didn't come here\nto leech off the Gormotti people.
26	You must band together\nand forge a new life\nin whatever way you can.
27	I cannot hold a sword, nor\ncan I administer first aid to\ninjured comrades.
28	But I am content to lend my\nlady Nia - my Driver - any\nstrength I can.
29	...Cat's got a point.\nSo, here's what I'm thinking.
30	It was tricky to get anything\nto grow in the soil back home...
31	But I worked as a researcher trying\nto squeeze as much growth out of\nour wee plants as we possibly could.
32	I'm pretty sure that if we applied\nmy research to the fertile soil you\nhave here, we'd get amazing results.
33	Listen boyo, we don't need your\nfancy Empire technology. We do just-
34	Hey, I'm growing Meaty Carrots\nin my own garden!
35	I wanna make them more\ntasty. Do you know how?
36	Of course, little one!
37	Woo hoo!\nHey, Da, can we let them help us?
38	Lavi, girl...
39	Leave it to children to demonstrate\nthe flexibility that adults lack.
40	Hmm... Fair do.\nWe're all on the same page here.\nLet's get these talks back on track.
41	I'm really sorry if I offended you.\nThese are trying times.
42	Please let us help you however\nwe can to make up for it.
43	I'm feeling good about how\nthings are working out.
44	Perhaps now we can move forward.
45	Thank you, everyone.\nEspecially you, Dromarch.
46	Sophora told me about everything\nyou did. I'm super grateful to you all.
47	I need to work hard until I'm\na Driver who doesn't worry their\nBlade quite as much as I do.
48	Hey, Oswalt... You know, it would be\nperfectly fine if you wanted to ride on\nmy back on occasion.
49	R-really?\nI'm pretty heavy, you know.
50	Don't worry about it!\nI'm a Blade. Strength is\none thing I have going for me.
51	Hey, Oswalt...\nYou know, if you ever feel sad, you're\nwelcome to cuddle up to me.
52	Th-thank you, Sophora... I'm sorry I'm\nsuch a miserable Driver. I wish I was\nbetter at fighting and whatnot.
53	Don't worry about it!\nYou have a good heart, Oswalt,\nand that's what really matters.
54	Our work is done here.\nWe must depart soon.
55	I am honored to have\nmet you, Sophora.
56	And I you, Dromarch.\nYou have given me confidence\nI did not feel before.
57	If I had not met you, I would no\ndoubt have gone through life\nnever really liking my own form.
58	You helped me, in turn, to see\nthe benefits of this appearance.
59	Wonderful!\nThank you, Dromarch. Truly.

1	Ohh, at last, a dashing gentleman!
2	Your splendor... It touches me in\nways I could not imagine!
3	Oh...forgive me. It's just that I've been\nholed up in my house for so long,\nI can't resist it if I see a pretty face...
4	I, er...I'm writing a book, you see.
5	It's on the topic of beautiful flowers.
6	I would desperately love to incorporate\nthe ice flowers that bloom nearby, but\nthe monsters make it nigh impossible.
7	You...you'd help me? Oh, this is\nwonderful news!
8	Ohh, to think the day would come that\nI would get to speak to such a fetching\nindividual... How your light dazzles...
9	...Cold, isn't it?
10	If only a dashing gentleman would talk\nto me and warm my heart from within...
qst104902_ms.json
1	Ohh, that face! Such eminent beauty!
2	I would like you to pick some of the\nelegant ice flowers that bloom near\nhere.
3	Just picturing your dazzling form\npicking those gorgeous flowers...\nOhh, fetch the smelling salts...
4	So you choose not to grace me with\nyour beguiling companions? I see...
5	Well, I'd like you to pick some ice\nflowers that bloom near here.
6	Don't bother me. I'm picturing the\nmoment where smoldering beauty\nmeets ice-cold flowers...
qst104903_ms.json
1	*gasp* You would come to me with\nyour radiant warmth and gorgeous\nFlowers of Ice...?
2	Wait... I feel as if I'm on the verge of a\nbreakthrough...
3	Give me a moment... The ideas are\ncoming to me now...
4	I would love to reward you, but please\nbear with me. I'm on the cusp!
5	...No! How could I even consider\nmaking one of Alrest's treasures\nwork for free!
6	I have a room over at Anastatia's in\nTheosoir. Could you pay me a visit\nthere later?
7	Ohh... The possibilities...
8	You've returned with the flowers\nI asked for?
9	But they're such beautiful flowers...\nI would really prefer to receive them\nfrom a similarly handsome gentleman...
qst104904_ms.json
1	Your incandescent face is like the\nrays of the sun... The room is\nbrightened by your very presence!
2	...Forgive me. I must try to compose\nmyself.
3	Your reward for fetching me the ice\nflowers, yes? How could I forget?
4	Would you...perhaps grace me with\none last, itty-bitty request?
5	You recall how I'm writing a book\nabout beautiful flowers?
6	I was thinking I would combine them\nwith some beautiful scenery and that\nwould be that.
7	But that would be an affront to true\nbeauty!
8	No, to capture that moment of the\nsublime, I need a truly breathtaking\nspectacle!
9	And none but you could make that\ndream, that fleeting vision a reality!\nI need you! Will you help me?
10	From the bottom of my heart, thank\nyou! Thank you.
11	Then, may I ask you to rid us of the\nJairo Griffox near the Lumos Pedestal?
12	A handsome warrior in a dreamlike\nsnowscape, fighting elegant beasts...\nTell me every detail.
13	Er, ah... Would you mind if I could talk\nto one of the handsome gentlemen in\nyour party?
qst104905_ms.json
1	Please make sure to remember every\nlast detail of your fight.
2	I'll be furiously writing down notes\nusing your description as reference!
3	I'd much prefer if a handsome\nyoung gentleman were to defeat\nthose monsters...
4	Well, I don't suppose it matters if\nsomeone else fights them. Just make\nsure your narrator is a pretty one...
qst104906_ms.json
1	Oh, beauteous gentleman! Your beads\nof sweat trickle like liquid diamond\nupon your pristine skin!
2	...My apologies. I can get a bit carried\naway.
3	Now do tell me all about your\nencounter with the Jairo Griffox!
4	What should I tell her?
5	We beat the enemy with deadly force.
6	Flames of friendship led us to victory.
7	A heated battle!\nThat would be the gist of it, yes?
8	Yes, yes, I see! Tell me more!\nAnd then...? ...Ah! What enchanting\nflames they must have been!
9	I've got it. Thank you so much\nfor all that.
10	Now, for your next assignment...
11	I'd like you to pick up the\nStoried Band that I dropped\nfrom atop the Amphoret Pillar.
12	Oh, pay no heed to the "storied"\npart. It's just a worthless trinket\nI was using as a prop, really...
13	What I want to capture is the vignette\nthat tells of your glorious success!
14	Tell me in detail just how you treat\nthe ring as you treasure it in those\nprecious hands!
15	Ah, my knights in shining armor have\nreturned... How I long to hear of their\nexploits from their own wondrous lips!
16	Ah, my dashing gentleman...\nPlease try to recall every detail as you\ntake the ring in your perfect fingers!
17	I'll need you to relate the scene vividly\nso I can use your story as inspiration!
18	Ideally, I'd like one of your\nmale contingent to fetch the\nStoried Band for me...
19	You can have someone else pick up\nthe ring if you must, but I insist that a\ndashing gentleman recount the tale...
qst104907_ms.json
1	My dreamy dapperling! Your presence\nalone transforms that cheap knock-off\nring into a cherished treasure!
2	...Terribly sorry. I don't know what\ncame over me.
3	Now, what intimate details can you\ngive me about the moment you made\nthe Storied Band your own?
4	What should we tell her?
5	Zeke and Rex's teeth were chattering.
6	Zeke and Rex made vows of friendship.
7	So it was a grueling search in the\nfreezing cold... I see, I see...
8	Ahhh! So one man placed the ring upon\nthe other's finger and swore that never\nwould they be parted? How wonderful!
9	Thank you, that should be enough.
10	I believe I've grasped the core themes\nfor my book now...
11	Ah...my pen arm... It's twitching...\nIt wants to write... I can't...contain it!
12	I'm going to write for a bit!\nBe back later!
13	...Phew! It's done!
14	"The Flora of Alrest"!
15	Err... Even after hearing your\ninspiring stories, the details didn't\nquite come together for me...
16	So I went back to my original plan\nand wrote about beautiful flowers\ninstead.
17	"Gentlemen: A Study"!
18	A tale of beauty and friendship\nunraveled within my imagination as I\nlistened to your impassioned stories...
19	And so contrary to even my\nexpectations, I have written a book\nthat's chock full of charming men!
20	I think it'll be a hit! Oh, don't worry,\nI've used all the tropes I can think of\nthat appeal to the masses!
21	I'll have it published once I'm finished\nediting, so be sure to buy a copy!
22	Thanks again for all your help.\nI've learned all sorts of things!
23	Plus I got to talk to all you fine\ngentlemen. A treat for the eyes\nas well as the old brain cells!
24	Incidentally, I'm a woman.
25	Whaaaat?! You mean...
26	I'm so sorry, it was just your clothes\nthat made me think... Beauty is a fickle\nthing, isn't it?
27	Ah, my knights in shining armor have\nreturned... How I long to hear of their\nexploits from their own wondrous lips!

6	Ah, if it isn't his Majesty and his\nfellow companions.

8	As a nation, the Genbu Crown is\nof paramount importance to us.
9	Having no interaction with outsiders,\nthere has been little need to police\nits borders...
10	Until now, that is. The enemy took the\nrecent chaos as an opportunity to\ninfiltrate the place.
11	We plan to station soldiers there\nso that this may never be allowed\nto happen again.
12	This is, however, not an ideal time\nto be sending our troops there.
13	Breeding season is fast approaching\nfor the BQ1053mtCarnivs inhabiting\nthe Memorial Ruins.
14	They're getting difficult to handle,\neven for our soldiers. The rising of the\nCloud Sea has agitated them, I expect.
15	We've been at a loss as to how to deal\nwith them. We can hardly sit by and\nwait for them to calm down...
16	You...you would help us? Oh, that\nis excellent news!
17	I can rest easy now knowing that his\nMajesty and cohorts are on the job.
18	Let's see... If you could cull 10 of their\nnumber, I think we would be able to\ndispatch our soldiers without hassle.
19	Do be careful, though.

1	I have something of a special request\nto ask. In particular of you, Rex.
2	Huh, you're asking me? Not Zeke?
3	Correct. You are the Aegis's Driver\nfirst and foremost, but you are also\na salvager, are you not?
4	Oh, yeah. Up until a little while ago,\nthat's how I made my living.
5	It so happens I used to dabble in the\nsalvaging business a little myself back\nin the day.
6	You were a salvager, Your Majesty?!
7	I'd had enough of the interminable\ndrudgery of the nobility. I decided it\nwas time to discover the real world.
8	So I can't exactly fault Zeke for\nhis own actions, haha...
9	I'd started salvaging on a whim. Yet\nbefore I knew it, I was desperate to get\nmy hands on treasures of legend.
10	Cool. I'd never have guessed.
11	So, did you find any legendary\ntreasure?
12	I'm afraid not. But I did manage to\npinpoint the location of some.
13	We were working on designs for a\nmachine we could use to winch it up.
14	But the sudden passing of my father\nbrought an end to all that...
15	Since then, I haven't had the time for\ntreasure hunting, let alone salvaging.
16	Oh... Um, so why are you telling\nme all this?
17	Because, well... Because I thought\nit was about time I started enjoying\nlife again.
18	I'd like you to retrieve the treasure\nI located all those years ago for me.
19	I would do it myself, but these old\nbones are far past the age for\nreckless gallivanting.
20	If you could gather the treasure and\nput it on display in this very room,\nI would be truly grateful.
21	Well, Your Majesty, you definitely\npicked the right guy for the job.\nIt'd be my pleasure!
22	Oh, splendid!
23	Then let me get to the point.\nThere are, in total, four treasures\nI'd like for you to retrieve.
24	The first is the Hammershead in\nTemperantia.
25	If you use the best quality cylinders in\ncertain weather conditions, you'll find\nthe treasure, I believe.
26	The second, the Golden Sunstone,\nlies in the Land of Morytha.
27	As I understand it, a salvager attempted\nto retrieve it from the Cliffs of Morytha,\nbut fumbled, and it sank deep.
28	And then there's the Calamity Puzzle...\nI hear a Nopon in Argentum finally\ngot his little wings on it.
29	So I suppose that one is less about\nsalvaging and more bartering.
30	And finally, the Orbital Skyreader, at a\nSalvage Point in Spirit Crucible Elpys.
31	I didn't even know there was a\nSalvage Point in Elpys!
32	Indeed, it is not easy to spot.
33	It seems like a void of nothingness,\ndoesn't it? But in actual fact, it adjoins\nthe Cloud Sea in a number of places.
34	I'm certain that we'll find what we're\nlooking for here, but the precise spot\nescapes me...
35	I suppose we ought to try looking\nin a few different locations!
36	I'm sorry to be asking so much of you,\nmy boy.
37	Back when I was a child, there wasn't a\nsalvager in Alrest who didn't dream of\nclaiming those treasures for their own.
38	Whosoever found all four would be\nrenowned for generations to come\nas the salvager among salvagers!
39	And they would have bestowed upon\nthem the title Salvager Supreme!
40	Once you find them, I'd like you\nto place them on the altars\nbehind me.
41	Wow, altars! You've already\nthought this far ahead?
42	Haha... Let's just say anticipation\nis a keen motivator.
43	Well, my boy, best of luck.
44	There's something I'd like to ask Rex.\nMay I talk with him for a moment?

4	Rex, I hereby anoint you...Salvager\nSupreme!
5	Salvager Supreme... That sounds...
6	Ah, forgive me. I acknowledge it is a\nsomewhat old-fashioned title for\na youngster such as you.
7	No no, I like it! Really! It's got a nice\nring to it!
8	Salvager Supreme... A salvager\namong salvagers...
9	I am honored, Your Majesty!
10	It is I who should be thanking you, Rex,\nfor fulfilling an old man's dream.
11	It is not just the title you have earned,\nbut my deepest respect. It is only fitting\nthat you receive an ample reward.
12	I see you've gathered all four\ntreasures. Would you mind letting\nme speak to Rex?

1	You come to see legendary treasure\ntoo?
2	This Calamity Puzzle! Incredible!\nAstounding!
3	Zubzub finally make dream of\nsalvagers around world reality!
4	You had fill of staring? Then\nZubzub go to sell treasure at\nCentral Exchange now.
5	Mehmeh? You want Calamity Puzzle?
6	Well, Zubzub planning to sell\nanyway, and it heavy to carry around,\nso not actual worst idea.
7	Selling for 500,000G.
8	Not see why friends surprised.\nIt reasonable going rate.
9	Had to wait super long time until Titan\nin exact position...
10	then lift up using expensive gas\ncylinders and crazy-good wire.
11	Zubzub not sell for less or else not\nturn out profit.
12	Pay 500,000G?
13	Pay
14	Don't pay
15	One, two, three... 500,000G, all there!
16	Calamity Puzzle all yours!
17	It extremely heavy, so friends\nbe careful when carrying.
18	Would have cost Zubzub 5,000G\nto carry to Central Exchange, so was\nbig big help!
19	OK, Zubzub return to treasure hunting\nnow. Thanks much again for purchase!
20	If friends not purchase, then Zubzub\nheading out to sell.
21	But not want to lug all way there, so\ncan wait for friends to prepare money.
22	If friends looking to purchase Calamity\nPuzzle, will be 500,000G.

2	ルクスリアがアデルの正当な後継でない事に\n納得がいかない
3	*sigh*
4	Master Liberbrant! Haven't seen you\nin donkey's!
5	Hmm? Oh! Your Highness?!\nI'm so sorry, I didn't recognize you!
6	Well met, well met indeed!\nAnd good to see you too, Pandoria!\nYou both look the picture of health!
7	Nice to see you too, Master Liberbrant!\nYou're lookin' chirpy as ever!
8	This gentleman here took care of\nthe prince when he was a kid.
9	Yep. I owe a lot to this chap.
10	So Master, what's with the sighing?
11	Oh, it's nothing you need concern\nyourself with. I would hate to be\nwasting your time.
12	Now don't be like that. You're not\nexactly being very convincing.
13	You're not wasting anyone's time.\nCome on, spit it out.
14	Hmm. Well, then...
15	I'm afraid this may seem a mite\nunsavory to be discussing with\nyou...
16	It's about the king. There are some\nwho dispute his claim to the throne.\nThat he is not Addam's heir.
17	Is it true? Does the king... Does Your\nHighness not share Addam's blood?
18	It's true. Bloody shame, though.
19	T-that cannot be! Then the retainers,\nthe people... They have all been\ndeceived? This whole time?
20	This is unthinkable! I had such respect\nfor the king, and for his ancestors...
21	No. No, in the end, it is all rumor and\ngossip. Someone must have planted\nfalse information, and...
22	Master Liberbrant, I'm sorry.\nIt's not a rumor.
23	But...
24	I know how important empirical proof\nis for you, Master.
25	Always telling me not to believe\nanything you haven't seen for yourself.\nYou drilled that into me, that's for sure.
26	Just you wait and see. Let me go and\nhave a quick chat with my old man.
27	What are you planning, My Prince?
28	Remember that room he showed us?
29	It was chock full of ornaments and\ndecorations. There's got to be some\nsort of written statement in there.
30	Are you sure about this? It's going to\n'cos one hell of an uproar.
31	I couldn't care less. What's the\npoint hiding it now anyway?
32	It might be hard on you, Master\nLiberbrant, but you've got to come to\nterms with it one way or another, OK?
33	...As you wish, Your Highness.
34	Well then, time to pay my old man\na visit!

6	I could have sworn it was there when\nI got up to get dressed this morning...
7	I'm afraid I haven't the time to go\nwandering around the castle for a\nmissing key. Could you look into it?
8	We've been informed of the situation.
9	It would be wise of you not to struggle.\nI'm afraid you're going to have to stay\nput for a little while...
10	That key opens the door to the\nHall of Honor. Open it, and see\nfor yourselves.
11	Indeed... Well then, it seems I owe\nyou an explanation with regard to\nthat matter.
12	The soldiers who incited the rebellion\nhave conceived a terrible plan.
13	They are trying to summon Addam\nhimself using his annals as a catalyst...
14	so that the people will recognize them\nas his true followers.
15	It's sheer madness, but I believe that\nthe best course of action is to halt\nthem dead in their tracks.
16	Thank you. I greatly appreciate it.
17	The summoning ceremony is to take\nplace at Spirit Crucible Elpys.
18	Ultimately, they are nothing more than\na disorderly mob. Once scattered, they\nwill be talking into the wind.
19	I need you to route them, stop their\nceremony, and take back the annals.
20	Again, I apologize for this. Normally,\nthis sort of matter would be dealt\nwith internally...
21	Hurry to Spirit Crucible Elpys, stop\ntheir summoning ceremony, and\nretrieve the annals of Addam.
22	The very thought of trying to\nsummon Addam himself...\nIt's the height of absurdity...

4	Zeke? What brings you here?
5	Not for sightseeing, I can tell you\nthat. I'm here on behalf of Master\nLiberbrant.
6	Liberbrant... Now there's a name\nI haven't heard in a while. What's\nthe occasion?
7	Wait, you're actually going to listen\nto me? Well there's a turn up for the\nbooks.
8	I am greatly indebted to Master\nLiberbrant for his tutelage. It's\nnothing to do with you.
9	I guess he's Master to a lot of us,\nhuh? Anyway, there's only one\nreason I'm here.
10	I need you to lend me those\n500-year-old records. You know\nthe ones.
11	The ones that detail the truth about\nTantal.
12	...Why?
13	It's for Master...and for the state.
14	Everyone's started talking about\nthe connection between Addam\nand Tantal...
15	Master feels betrayed, and so do the\npeople. Finding out everything they\nbelieved in all these years was a lie...
16	It's not an easy thing to accept. And\nnow they're starting to turn a blind eye\nto it. Refusing to believe the facts.
17	We've got to nip it in the bud before\nit gets out of hand, Dad.
18	You know me. I hate to leave things\nunfinished.
19	...All right.
20	You'll find the records in the Hall of\nHonor, not the room I showed you\nbefore. Look for a vault on... Hm?
21	Yeah?
22	Normally, I would have the key on\nmy person...
23	But...?
24	But...the chain appears to have\nbeen cut.
25	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]What?! It's one thing after\nanother, isn't it?
26	Your Highness! You mustn't let your\ntemper flare in front of His Majesty!
27	You...dropped it?
28	You'd have to be a total numpty to go\nand lose something that important!
29	Your Highness! Language!
30	Your Majesty...would you happen\nto know where you might have\ndropped it?
31	Let's see...
32	I got up, washed my face, got dressed,\nhad breakfast...and then sat down here.
33	After meals, I always go for a stroll\naround the castle. Today, as I recall...
34	I went from the Hall of Reception to\nthe Hall of Plenty, briefly perused the\nHall of Virtue, and then came back.
35	So basically you were wandering\naround the basement.
36	Indeed. I did not leave the premises.
37	Fine. Whatever. We'll go and have\na look around the castle then...

5	Some of our men who heard the\nrumors about his Majesty and Addam\nhave turned on us!
6	What?!
7	They're saying that they're going to\ntake up arms against the king because\nhe hid the truth from them!
8	Crap, I was worried this might happen!
9	Better get to it, my Prince!
10	What are we looking at?
11	The soldiers who planned the coup\nare starting skirmishes all over the\ncastle!
12	Tell all units to suppress the enemy\nuprising and secure the area, ASAP!
13	Understood, Your Highness!
14	All right, time to join the fray!
15	Sorry about this, Pandy.\nNever thought I'd be getting you roped\nyou up in personal troubles.
16	Hey, I'm your Blade. Your burden\nis my burden, remember. Half of\nthis is my responsibility.
17	Still...
18	You're clearly much stronger than me.\nI reckon we should split it 70:30.

7	After hundreds of years of deception,\nnow is the time to take down your\nsham of a family, and-
8	That's enough. I don't want to have\nto resort to undue force.
9	Hah! The prodigal son has spoken!
10	We're the victims here! Have you ever\nstopped to look at your people?
11	People are starving, freezing to death!\nAll because we're being governed by\na false monarch!
12	I said shut your damn mouth!
13	I know what you're trying to say.\nI feel cheated just as much as you.
14	But I fail to see how the state of the\ncapital's got anything to do with\nwhether my dad's got Addam's blood!
15	You can judge us however you like.\nJust wait until we've got Tantal back\non its feet first.
16	Your Highness...
17	Hah! Your opinion is duly noted,\n"Your Highness".
18	We've done our part. It won't be long\nnow...
19	Soon, the royal family will fall at\nthe hands of Addam himself!\nAha...ahaha...AAAHAHAHAHA!
20	Addam himself? What's that supposed\nto mean?
21	You'll just have to wait and see, won't\nyou? HA-hahahaha!!!

9	Hmm. His Majesty isn't the type to lie\nabout this sort of thing...
10	Yeah, deffo. Just like how he wouldn't\nlie about being the direct descendant\nof Addam.
11	That's not the same!

5	Deliver justice to the false king who\nled his people astray!
6	Hold it right there!
7	Ozychlyrus! What are you doing here?!
8	You've done enough fooling around.\nDo you seriously think you're going\nto summon Addam that way?
9	This is not "fooling around"! This is\na sacred ceremony to bring about\nHis resurrection!
10	Oh yeah? Well, where is he then?\n'Cos I don't see him anywhere!\nOh, maybe he's running late?
11	Grrr... Don't mock us!
12	You'll see soon enough. Addam will\nbe reborn, and you will bear witness!
13	He will come, and He will uproot the\nold rule, the false rule, that has\noppressed Tantal for 500 years!
14	OK, they've dialed it up way past\ncrazy now.
15	I wouldn't bother trying to argue with\nthese fanatics any longer, my Prince.
16	Yeah, it's not looking too hopeful...
17	I think you've been truly wronged.\nNot least by my father...
18	But getting rid of us isn't going to\nhelp Tantal whatsoever!
19	For as long as I breathe, I plan to do\neverything I can to make up for all the\nlies you've been told.
20	Anyhow, I can see this isn't getting\nthrough to you. You won't mind if\nI get a bit rough then, will you!

6	Read this. You can read the ancient\nlanguage, can you not?
7	I can. Let me see...
8	This... Why, this is... But this can't be...\nIt's absolutely...
9	The Tantal bloodline is not directly\ndescended from Addam...
10	After usurping the throne during\na period of turmoil... Ohh...\nMy goodness...
11	So now you see.\nI intend to announce it publicly,\nwhen the time is right.
12	Were we not a pure...noble bloodline?\nWhat was it all for...?
13	Master Liberbrant... You've read\nthrough it all?
14	From cover to cover, yes...
15	All right. Why do you think our\nancestors claimed that we were\ndirect descendants of Addam?
16	Well...
17	Addam defended the Tornans in order\nto unite Tantal as one people.
18	We may not have inherited Addam's\nblood...
19	But let me tell you this: we sure as\nhell inherited his spirit!
20	Not his blood, but his spirit...\nThat I cannot deny, Your Highness.
21	I fear I may have been getting my\npriorities out of order.
22	To think, the teacher would one day\nbecome the student... You've come\na long way, my child.
23	So you get it now? That's what I like\nto hear!

7	...I will have to leave a whole page\nin my journal for this.

1	ふむ――\nどうしたものかねぇ――
2	おう　実はスペルビアで店を開きたいと\n考えていたんだが
3	先日のアーケディア崩壊に巻き込まれた際に\n財産の大半を失くしてな――
4	長年貯めていた開業資金は\n雲海の藻屑に化しちまったよ
5	それは――
6	大変でしたねと言う
7	潜って回収できないのか尋ねる
8	ああ――　だがむしろここまで不幸が続けば\n次はきっといいことがあると希望が持てるさ
9	それができれば良かったが――\n生憎俺はサルベージャーではない
10	それに　今から取りに行っても\nもうわからない場所まで流れてるだろうな
11	現状手持ちで金になりそうなものと言えば\nこのサルベージ品くらいだが――
12	いかんせん状態が悪いからなあ\nジャンクショップでも\n買い取ってもらえるかどうか――
13	何？　本当か？
14	――そうだな\nここで会ったのも何かの縁だ\nアンタに任せてみよう！
15	ジャンクショップはアイヴィル商業区の\n一番端にあるから見つけやすいはずだ
16	すまないが　よろしく頼んだぜ
17	どうだい　あれは売れたか？
18	――そうか\nまあジャンク品だからな\nそうそう買い取ってくれる人もいないだろう
19	難しいだろうが頑張ってくれ
qst105902_ms.json
1	やあ　いらっしゃい！\n今日はどんな御用で？
2	これを買い取ってもらえないかな？
3	これを買い取ってくれない？
4	これを買い取って欲しいのだが
5	これを買い取って欲しいんやけど
6	これを買い取ってほしいも
7	これをかい？　うーん――\nちょっと状態が悪くて厳しいかな――
8	あ　そうだ！\nこれとなら交換できるよ
9	うちでは全く使い道がなくて\n持て余していたから　持って行ってよ
10	こっちも助かってるから\nお礼なんていらないよ
11	この木材　かなり質がいいみたいだから\nグーラの職人なら喜んでくれると思うよ
qst105903_ms.json
1	何？　交換？\nウチはそういったことはしてねぇんだが――
2	――いや　待ってくれ\nソイツをもっと良く見せてくれねぇか？
3	おお！　これだ！\nちょうどこの木材が欲しかったんだよ！
4	ああ　今作ってるインテリアに\nこの木材が必要だったんだんだが
5	貴重なもんだから手に入れるのが難しくてな
6	これとあとパズルツリーがあれば――
7	おっ　本当かい？\nじゃああんたらに頼もうかね
8	パズルツリーはグーラの○○で\nよく採れるそうだ
9	数は　そうだな――\n3個ほど持ってきてくれると助かる
10	んじゃ　頼んだぜ！
11	俺が欲しいのはパズルツリー3個だ\nグーラの○○あたりで採れるらしいぞ
12	すまねぇが頼むぜ！
13	持ってきてくれたか！\nありがてぇ！
14	これでインテリアを\n完成させることができる！
15	ああ　助かった！\nおかげで納期に間に合うぜ！
16	――っといけねぇ\n持ってきてくれた礼だ　受け取ってくれ
17	インヴィディアの知人にもらったんだが\n俺には似合わなくてな
18	結局一度も着ないで\nタンスの肥やしになっちまってたんだ
19	このまま使わないってのも悪いし\n良かったら持ってってくれ
20	なんでも向こうじゃ貴重なもんらしいから\n持ってて損はねぇはずだ
qst105904_ms.json
1	いらっしゃいませ！\n――あら
2	その貫頭衣　すっごく素敵だわ！\nどちらで買われたのかしら？
3	――なるほど\nそうことだったのね
4	インヴィディアではなかなか手に入らないで\n有名な商品で　いつも品切れなのよ
5	――あの\nこんなことを言うのはどうかと思うのだけど
6	貫頭衣を譲っていただくことは可能かしら？
7	もちろんタダでとは言わないわ\nそうね――
8	この小型エーテル原子炉と\n交換するというのはどうかしら？
9	まあ！　本当に！？\n交渉成立ね！
10	ありがとう！　すっごく嬉しいわ！
11	今度ウチの店にいらした時には\nサービスするわね！
12	小型エーテル原子炉か――\nこれなら高値で売れそうだ！
13	小型エーテル原子炉ね――\nこれなら高値で売れるんじゃないかな
14	ふむ　小型エーテル原子炉――\nこれであれば高値で取引できるだろう
15	へぇ　小型エーテル原子炉か――\nこれやったら高値で売れるかもしれひんな
16	小型エーテル原子炉なら\nきっと高値で売れるも！
qst105905_ms.json
1	戻ってきたな\n首尾はどうだった？
2	これは小型エーテル原子炉か！\n高価だろうに　よく交換できたなあ！
3	だがこれなら高く売れるはずだ！
4	さて　問題はどこに売るかだが――
5	ああ　そうだ\nアーケディアには高値で物を\n買い取ってくれる店があったな
6	聞いた噂だとアーケディア崩壊後は\nアヴァリティアに拠点を移したらしい
7	再び頼んですまないが店を探し出して\nこれを売ってきてくれねぇか？
8	ありがとな\n気をつけて行ってこい
9	どうだい　あれは売れたか？
10	――そうか　まだか
11	別に気にしなくてもいい\nむしろ無理を言っているのは俺の方だからな
qst105906_ms.json
1	らっしゃい！\nんん？　あんた　初めて見る顔だな
2	まあ一見さんお断りってわけじゃねぇから\n追い返すなんてこたぁしねぇさ
3	んじゃま　早速仕事といこうじゃねぇか\nまず先にあんたのランクを確認させてくれ
4	急に黙り込んじまってどうした？\n何？　ランクについて知らない？
5	それも知らずにここへ来たってのか！\n悪いが　それじゃあ買取の交渉はできねぇ
6	あんま大声じゃ言えねぇんだがよ\n俺んとこの店はランク付けされた\n一部のサルベージャーしか利用できねぇんだ
7	サルベージ品を売りてぇなら\nまずはアヴァリティアで\nランク付けをしてもらってこい
8	ここは特級サルベージャーだけが\n立ち入りを許されてる店だ
9	あんたが特級になってまたここに来りゃ\nその時は正式な客として相手をしてやるぜ
10	なんだ　まだ特級になっていないのか？
11	俺と交渉したいなら\nまずはランクを上げて来い\n話をするのはそれからだぜ
12	らっしゃい！\nおう　あんたか！
13	どうだい　特級にはなれたのかい？
14	――ほほう　それならお客さんだな！\nで？　売りたい物はなんだ？
15	――ふむ　小型のエーテル原子炉か\nなかなかいい状態だな\nこれなら12000Gで買い取るぜ！
16	何　そう驚くことじゃないさ\n誰がサルベージしてきたのかというのも\n物の価値を上げる要素のひとつなのさ
17	というわけでこいつを買い取らせてもらうぜ
18	いやいや\nこちらこそありがとな
19	また売りたいもんをサルベージしたら\nウチに持ってきてくれや
qst105907_ms.json
1	メロロに御用かも？
2	レックス　今日はどうしたも？
3	も？　サルベージャーランク？
4	聞いたことはあるも\nでもそれは裏で行われている非公式なものも
5	あまり言いふらすのはよくないけれど\n今回だけトクベツもよ
6	とはいえ\nメロロもあまり詳しいことは知らないも
7	聞いた噂だとリムリムってやつが\nランク付けをしてるらしいから\n会って話を聞いてみるといいも
8	そうそう　このランク付けは非公式だから\n公言するのはごはっとも！
9	リムリムに会えた？（仮）
qst105908_ms.json
1	もも？\nきみもキササにランク付けされたいも？
2	いいもよ\nそれじゃ　1000G払うも
3	ランクを付けるてまちんとして\n1000Gかかるも
4	――――
5	う　ううっ――\nしょうがないもね　500Gで手を打つも\nだからそんな目で見ないでほしいも
6	ではでは気を取り直して話を進めるも
7	サルベージャーのランクは\nきみが今までサルベージして取得した物の\n総合価値で決まるも
8	まずは初級から始めるも\nサルベージしてすごい物がたくさん取れたら\n格付けしに来るも
9	ただ毎回てまちんとして500Gかかるから\nそれなりに見つけてから来た方が\nいいかもしれないも
10	それと\nランクはひとつずつしか上がらないから\nあしからずも
11	リムリムに格付けチェックされるも？
12	格付けチェックをしてもらう？
13	してもらう
14	してもらわない
15	リョーカイも！\nさあさあバシバシ格付けするも！
16	きみのサルベージャーランクは――
17	初級も\nまだまだひよっこだも！
18	中級も\nひよっこから見習いに昇級も！
19	上級も！\nようやくここまできたも\nイタダキはすぐソコも！
20	おめでとう　特級も！\nこれからもバリバリ働くも！
21	リョーカイも\n格付けしてもらいたくなったら\nいつでもリムリムのところに来るも
22	きみは特級になったよ\nこれからも頑張ってね（仮）
qst105909_ms.json
1	おう　帰ったか\n無事小型エーテル原子炉は売れたのかい？
2	12000Gで買い取ってもらえたのか！\n高価だとはわかっていたが\nまさかそこまで高く売れるとは――
3	どうやらアンタに任せて正解だったようだな\n本当に助かった
4	ここまで付き合ってもらったんだ\n相応の礼をしなくてはな
5	働きに見合うものではないだろうが\nどうか受け取ってくれ
6	アンタが稼いでくれた資金を元手に\nどうにか頑張ってみよう
7	では俺はこれで失礼する\n準備を進めなくてはならないからな
8	開店した暁には立ち寄ってくれると嬉しい
qst106001_ms.json
1	Hey, Dadapon! You feeling OK?\nYour fluff look ruffly!
2	Huh?\n...Oh, it Tora.
3	Me not too bad. Tum-tum is quiet.
4	Masterpon is careful with health.\nGood food, much sleep, regular poo-poo.
5	Indeed! Body of Dadapon is temple!
6	Too much info for Tora!\n...So then, why make grumble-noise?
7	Ah, well... Thing is...
8	Was thinking of making new mode for Poppi.
9	Oh!\nTora and Dadapon have same idea!
10	Tora was thinking it about time Poppi got even more Poppi-power!
11	What? Tora think that too?
12	Truly Tora is sonnypon of Tatazo! Has Dadapon's ideas too!
13	So... What was Dadapon's idea?\nTell Tora!
14	Tora excited?\nOK, Dadapon will let cat out from bag.
15	Behold! Poppi's most super-duper mode.
16	W-what's this?!
17	You like?\nTora like so much, run out of words, maybe?
18	This mode called 'Super Fighter Mode'!
19	This Poppi size of ten Rosas.\nMore battle power than Titan warship.
20	What Dadapon thinking?!
21	Dadapon just take old Poppi blueprint\nand enlarge!
22	Dadapon thinking just like Bana...
23	What? Tora not like great big Poppi?
24	Well, how about this?
25	Uh? Hmmm...\nToo small for Tora's eyesight...
26	This is titchy little Poppi.\nExtreme compact.
27	But what for...?!\n...And you just changed size again...
28	What good is itty-bitty little Poppi?\nCatch mice and rats maybe...
29	Tora not see? This Poppi piddly, but can\nsneak in anywhere, and no one know!
30	And battle capabilities same as normal Poppi!\nStrong like ant!
31	Dadapon...\nAll this a bit fur-brained...
32	Not like little piddly Poppi either...?
33	Well... Let's hear Tora's silly idea then.
34	Really want to hear?\nReally?!
35	All right, Tora suppose can share secret.
36	Tora's big idea called...\nPoppi QTπ!
37	Cootie-Pie?
38	Right! Nearly...
39	This Poppi become great big grown-up.\nPoppi should move to next phase of life!
40	Tora and Poppi grow up together!
41	Uhm...\nI know not meaning of 'QTπ', but...
42	Tora's unruly, lovable enthusiasm shine through, very bright!
43	Dadapon! Dadapon like it!
44	Yes, Tora.\nThis make sense, for a change.
45	Very well! Dadapon will get right to it!\nLila! Ready my things!
46	Yes, Masterpon! At once.
47	Hear that, Poppi?
48	Masterpon and Dadapon will work in chamber for a little bit.
49	Don't let anyone disturb very very very important work!\nGot it?
50	Yes, Masterpon!
51	Tora... What's the little ball of fur getting into this time?
52	Unclear...
53	It sounded like they were going to try to\npower up Poppi somehow.
54	I also caught some bollocks about "growing up" and "phase of life".
55	You'd know. You're the master of talking bollocks.
56	Huh? How dare you.
57	Ugh. You know exactly what I mean.
58	Well, I guess this means they're going to remodel Poppi.
59	Guess so.
60	Whatever it is, looks like they won't\nbe coming out of there for a while.
61	Nothing for it. Why don't we go and take a rest at the inn?
62	Huh?\nThey're still at it?
63	Yes, Catlady.
64	Masterpon working feverishly.\nNot stop for food, sleep, or poo-poo.
65	Tora... He doesn't know what's good for him, sometimes.
66	He's going to work himself bald one of these days.
67	Urk!
68	My lady!
69	Tadaa!\nMaster plan of Tora complete!
70	'Master plan'? Sounds great.\nBut what on earth is it, Tora?
71	Meh-he-he-he...
72	Behold!\nReally something, huh?
73	Ooh!
74	Behold!\nFinal and bestest form of Poppi!
75	My lady... Are you quite all right?!
76	...gyagh...
77	Tora...!\nIs this not...too much?!
78	Only yesterday, Poppi was littlepon...\nMaybe she grow too fast!
79	Tora not care!
80	Tora feel that Poppi is ready to be real grown-up.
81	Tora... Can you really build such advanced robo-woman?
82	Dadapon. Tora mean what he say.
83	Destiny calling for Tora.\nRude not to say "hello" back.
84	Well said, my littlepon.
85	[ML:undisp ]AD LIB unease
86	Urgh...
87	Will...you...get...OFF me already...!!
88	Meh-mehh!
qst106002_ms.json
1	Masterpon say he need Golden Cogs.
2	Lila has heard Golden Cog can be\nfound in region of Temperantia.
3	Many materials required to make\nnew outfit for Poppi.
4	Can find Cubic Diamond in\nEmpire of Mor Ardain.
5	Ambler Stigma, though...Lila think it\nnot found anywhere on Alrest Titans.
6	Friend can get Genbu-Weave Cloth in\nland of Tantal...
7	Please talk to Masterpon.
8	If friends not talk to him soon, he\nprobably shrivel up from loneliness.
9	Friends should go to Goldmouth\nFlight Deck in Argentum.
10	Attending Bluesky Nopon University...\nSounds quite fun actually.
11	How was Bluesky Nopon University?
12	Please report findings to Masterpon.
13	Extreme large amounts of energy\nneeded for remodeling Poppi.
14	Please work hard to charging energy.
15	Lila want to see Poppi all grown up...!
qst106003_ms.json
1	First friends need to gather\nGolden Cog.
2	This only very first step.\nBest to get it over with quick-quick!
3	Busy preparing for remodeling\nright now.
4	Friends forget about me for now\nand focus on outfit, yes?
5	Materials for outfit all ready?
6	Please give materials to Lila.
7	Now, friends go to Goldmouth Flight\nDeck in Argentum and speak to Nopon\nby name of Fleecyflossy!
8	Help Poppi do trial attendance\nat Bluesky Nopon University\nand learn many things.
9	Only when education complete is\nPoppi ready for big remodeling!
10	Entering university is most important\nthing of all!
11	All ready for remodeling of Poppi.
12	Now all that left is to charge up energy\nin charging unit right there.
13	Maybe most efficient way is use\nmercenaries to gather E-Pack.
qst106004_ms.json
1	Dadapon! I bring materials!
2	Welcome back, Tora.\nPreparation of workshop all ready.
3	Me work on expansion parts now.\nLila, you watch over and make sure\nnobody distract me.
4	Leave it to Lila, Masterpon!
5	Um... If Poppi's going to be all\ngrown up now, isn't she going to\nneed new clothes?
6	Really? I think the ones she has\nright now look just fine...
7	Uh, if her body size changes, they're\nnot exactly going to fit, are they?
8	If she gets bigger in the clothes\nshe's wearing now, things could\nget...awkward fast.
9	Exactly!
10	And it wouldn't be fair on her not to\nhave any nice outfits to wear after\nher special upgrade, anyway!
11	Really?
12	Mythra and Pyra both seem stylish\nwith default look. Poppi is Blade too,\nso not really bothered about clothing.
13	We can't have that!\nAbsolutely not!
14	Blade or human, artificial or otherwise,\nyou should at least have some sense\nof modesty!
15	Hmmm... Poppi not really understand.
16	Tora think new costume important for\nincreasing sense of cool new power-up!
17	Factor of coolness very important!
18	Very well. Lila will make new costume\nfor little sister Poppi.
19	Really? Big sis Lila make costume?
20	Yes. Lila not have many opportunity\nto do things for sweet little sister.\nWill make masterpiece costume!
21	Since Poppi become very grown-up,\nwant costume that looks glamorous!
22	But not losing sense of cute.\nCute also important.
23	Also, needs to look cool and powerful!\nIs for power-up, after all.
24	Meh-meh... That is lot of requests.
25	How's she going to fit all that\ninto one design, eh?
26	Is not possible?
27	For sake of little sister Poppi...\nLila make anything possible!
28	Thank you, big sis Lila!
29	But to make such specific costume,\nLila probably need more materials...
30	What kind of things are you after?
31	Cubic Diamond and Ambler Stigma...
32	Oh, and Genbu-Weave Cloth\nimportant too.
33	That doesn't sound too hard.\nCome on, Poppi, let's go find them!
34	Understood! Poppi will bring very\nfinest materials for new costume!
qst106005_ms.json
1	Welcome to Bluesky Nopon University.\nYou are applicants for trial attendance?
2	That is right! Poppi will learn\nto be proper lady!
3	...To be lady?
4	Fleecyflossy not know what you talking\nabout there, but me get you started\nwith lessons anyway.
5	If you keep up with lessons to very end,\nwill be filled with power of education!
6	So work hard to follow lesson!
7	Understood!
8	So. First period lesson start right now!
9	First period is forestry lesson.
10	Now, Poppi.\nTry read text that is written on board.
qst106007_ms.json
1	Hm... Interesting... Very interesting!
2	How is text?\nIs Poppi understanding properly?
3	Yes! Poppi understand all about\nimportance of forests!
4	Forest and trees is important for\nbuild houses to live in and furniture\nfor everyday life...
5	Not just place for monsters to live!
6	Very good!
7	Trees of forest also help purify\nwater and even prevent natural\ndisaster like landslides.
8	Not to mention provide beautiful\nrelaxing sight to heal hearts of people!
9	Poppi understand.\nIs like scales fall from eyes of Poppi!
10	Congratulations, Poppi.\nYou successfully learned forestry!
11	Now time for second period lesson.\nNext up is observation class.
12	We take short break first, so please\ncome back when ready for begin\nnew lesson.
13	Yes, teacher Fleecyflossy!
qst106008_ms.json
1	Now, time to begin lesson two!
2	Second period lesson is about\nobservation.
3	You be greeted by three Nopon now.\nTask for Poppi is to deduce which\nNopon is merchant!
4	Lulumu is called Lulumu.\nPleasure to meet friends.
5	Yo, friends. Me is cool Nopon,\nname of Kalukalu.
6	Friends not be stranger, yeah?
7	Me is called Yatata.
8	One Nopon out of three is merchant.\nDoes Poppi know which?
9	Who is the merchant?
10	Lulumu
11	Kalukalu
12	Yatata
13	Bad choosing. Answer was wrong!\nBut there always time to try again!
14	Correct choice! Poppi make very\ndecisive decision there.
15	But next question will be harder!
16	My name is Beltran.
17	Name's Gruth.\nAnd don't you forget it.
18	Hi there.\nMy name's Cheelo!
19	Now then. Which of these three\nposed while introducing self?
20	Who was it that posed?
21	Gruth
22	Beltran
23	Cheelo
24	Too bad. Answer is wrong!\nBut feel free to try one time more!
25	Correct answer!
26	Poppi very good at this.\nHighly refined skill of observation!
27	Always noticing slightest change,\nnever missing single thing!
28	Good sense of observation very\nimportant skill in life and learning.
29	Should try to hone observation skill\neven more in future!
30	Yes, teacher Fleecyflossy!
31	Well then, next is third period!\nKeep up good work!
qst106009_ms.json
1	Time for third period!
2	Third period lesson is ancient\ncivilization studies.
3	Like for first lesson, please read\ntext that is on board.
4	First period is forestry lesson.
5	Now, Poppi.\nTry read text that is written on board.
6	To obtain true education, need good\nphysical ability and technique.
7	But lately physical abilities of youth\non the decline. Is very sad.
8	So tell me, Poppi. You physical ability\nbetter than lazy modern youth?
qst106012_ms.json
1	Poppi back now!
2	Welcome back, Poppi.\nLila feel that Poppi seem somehow\nmore grown up already.
3	Lila correct! Poppi is true lady now!
4	Lila done with preparing new outfit,\nand preparations for upgrade all\nfinished too.
5	Only one thing left - waiting for\ndevice to finish charging up.
6	So it won't be long until Poppi has\na brand new form of her very own!
7	Tora starting to get nervous...
8	So, when do we start the upgrade?
9	Meh-meh-meh...\nCharging of device take one week.
10	Whaaaa?! How can it take a whole\nweek just for the thing to power up?
11	Is only natural! Upgrading of Poppi\nrequire immense power!
12	Not simple easy process!
13	We can't just wait around for a whole\nweek, though... I'd go crazy from the\nanticipation!
14	Isn't there any way of speeding up\nthe charging process?
15	Mehmeh...
16	Well, if you put energyful materials\ninto charging device, charging maybe\nfinish quicker.
17	Item called E-Pack is most efficient,\nbut other materials also OK.
18	Quickest plan probably to get\nmercenaries to collect many\nE-Pack for us!
19	Makes sense, I guess.\nThen maybe we'll do that.
20	Just hang in there a little longer,\nall right, Poppi?
21	Poppi OK to wait!\nGood luck with charging, everyone!
qst106013_ms.json
1	Internal pressure remain stable.
2	Dadapon, crank up voltage a bit further!
3	Tora! Increasing load even more maybe dangerous!
4	Levels not there yet, Dadapon!
5	We not cross the line...but we step on it!
6	OK!\nLila! Look closely at meter doodah!
7	Yes, Masterpon!
8	Hoo-hoo! Preparations are prepared.
9	Lila! Hit switch!
10	Roger, Masterpon!
11	OK, Poppi!\nWakey wakey!
12	Hey, what's this?!\nLeaving us in the dark?
13	I... I can't see a thing!
14	What... Did something go wrong?
15	I don't know...
16	The lights went out the first time\nwe started Poppi up too, remember?
17	Isn't it...taking a bit long, though...?
18	Ah...yeah...
19	Whoaa!
20	Wh-what is it...?
21	*hack* *splutter*\nWas that a lightning bolt or something?
22	Everyone OK?
23	I'm OK.\nBut what about Poppi?! How's she doing?!
24	Woohoo! Success!\nLook! Glorious birth of Poppi QTπ!
25	...urgh...uh...
26	Ah!\nGood morning, everybody!
27	Uh? Huh?\nM-morning...?
28	So...this is the new Poppi?
29	Cool! I'm starting to think there's something\nin Tora's science malarkey after all!
30	Poppi's an adult now?\nTalk about a growth spurt...
31	What's up, Nia? Jealous much?
32	Shut it, Zeke! Unless you want me to\nremodel your face!
33	Come, Poppi!\nGive us demonstration of new power!
34	Roger roger, Masterpon!
35	W-whoa, Poppi!\nMasterpon has own legs!
36	Masterpon have very short legs.
37	Much more efficient like this when\nMasterpon travel with Poppi.
38	This very silly.\nAnd big disrespect to your Masterpon!
39	Hahaha! You look like Poppi's\nlittle teddy bear there, Tora.
40	Meh-meh...!
41	Tora is not little teddy bear!
42	Put Tora down, Poppi!\nRight now!
43	Hey, it's not so bad.\nAt least you don't have to walk.
44	Tora does not like.
45	Tora is grown-up big adult...\nPoppi, come on! Poppi!!!
qst106017_ms.json
1	Dadapon, what you mean by\ngetting Poppi ready?
2	Exercises? Poppi always ready\nfor warm-up exercises!
3	Exercises...?\nWhat Poppi talking about?
4	Poppi thought maybe need to do\nexercises to get ready for big upgrade...
5	Such silly idea.
6	Artificial Blade not need exercises!\nAs long as joints not rusty, always\nready to operate at full capacity!
7	Anyway, Tora. Please take Poppi\nand go to Goldmouth Flight Deck\nin Argentum.
8	Argentum? For what?

10	Poppi really does know how to throw\nshade sometimes, doesn't she.\nDid you design her that way, Tora?
11	T-Tora not know what Nia mean!\nTora not weird person who like\nbeing insulted!
12	Tora have no idea how Poppi end up\nwith personality like this!
13	Would make Tora happy if Poppi\nlearn to act more polite like Lila!
14	Tora only say that because he not\nsee how harsh Lila can be.

qst200201_ms.json
1	So, Rex. Will going to Elysium really\nbring people happiness?
2	I can't say anything for sure yet,\nbut that's what I choose to believe.
3	Can't say for sure, eh?
4	You know, Rex...
5	I've seen a lot of different people\nduring the missions I've completed.
6	This world is full of people suffering\nfor all kinds of reasons.
7	People who are tricked by others and\nlose their homes. People who resort to\nkilling in order to survive.
8	Some even betray their own families\nfor the sake of money.
9	When I see all that, I... I just...
10	I want to smack some sense into\nthe lot of them!
11	I want to give them a taste of my\nburning passion, and set their hearts\nback on the right path!
12	Godfrey...
13	Protecting the weak, and passing\njudgment on the strong!
14	That's what I believe my power is for.
15	But if I'm gonna set the fire of justice\nburning in this world, I'm gonna need\nyour help! That's all I wanted to say.
qst200202_ms.json
1	Whuh-?!
2	Surprise attack? Sneaky...
3	If it's a fight you want, why don't you\nface me fair and square?!
4	What's wrong, cat got your tongue?
5	In that case, let's let our\nfists do the talking!
qst200203_ms.json
1	You must be Godfrey, right?
2	You're every bit as overbearing\nas I'd heard.
3	So what if I am?
4	You're the ones with some explainin' to do!\nWhy did you attack us?
5	Well, when we heard about you...\nIt got us a little bit curious.
6	Heard about me?
7	Yeah. 'Bout how you're a righteous Blade.
8	You really think you can save people with\nthat childish sense of justice?
9	You ask the dumbest questions!\nOf course I can save people!
10	...But is that true?\nOr is it just wishful thinking?
11	What're you saying to me, scumbag?
12	Justice doesn't help anyone in the\nreal world. It just gets in their way.
13	I thought I might teach you that lesson myself.
14	You wanna teach me?\nYou don't know crap!
15	I WILL use this power of justice,\nand I WILL save people! Lots of them!
16	Ugh, could you turn down the heat?\nIt's pretty difficult to bear.
17	If your "flame of justice" burns any hotter,\nwe'll have a heatwave on our hands.
18	Listen to me, Godfrey.\nIf you want to stick with this whole justice thing...
19	You should look into a girl called\nHarghal, in Argentum.
20	A girl? What about her?
21	She was a dancing girl in Bana's little sideshow.\nDo some digging, and you'll understand.
22	Then we'll all see how much your justice\nis really worth...
qst200204_ms.json
1	How can I help you?
2	You're Krujah, right?
3	Yes, that's my name.
4	Tell us everything you know\nabout Harghal!
5	Harghal?!
6	...Sorry, but I can't help you there.
7	We heard the two of you were\nthe best of friends, though.
8	I don't know who told you that\nnonsense, but believe me, I'm not\nfriends with that woman.
9	Now if you're not customers, could\nyou get going? You're getting in the\nway of my work.
10	Why are you so afraid to talk?
11	I'm not afraid. I just don't want to\nthink about that traitor!
12	She was an incredible dancer -\neveryone's darling, Bana's favorite.
13	And then she betrayed me and just left!\nIs that something a friend would do?!
14	This doesn't seem like it's going to be\nstraightforward. What should we do?
15	Leave it to me!\nI'll talk some sense into her!
qst200205_ms.json
1	All this griping isn't going to solve\nanything. Tell us what happened!
2	That look in your eyes...there's a\nfierce passion behind it. Reminds\nme of Harghal, actually...
3	I loved dancing since I was a little girl.\nThat's why I came to Argentum to\nmake my fortune as a dancer.
4	I hit it off with Harghal right away,\nbecause we both had the same dream.
5	So you really were best friends.
6	Sure we were. We were practically\ninseparable. I told her everything.
7	But her talent was the real deal,\nand I...just couldn't compare.
8	While she was shining like a star on the\nstage, I was just lurking in her shadow.
9	She got all the attention from Bana,\nwhile I was just a tagalong.
10	Naturally, when Bana took a liking\nto you, it meant you got better pay.
11	She got the best of everything,\nand I wasn't too bad off either.
12	But then there was that huge scandal,\nand Bana was ruined.
13	After that, I couldn't support myself\nwith dancing alone. I had to take up\njobs at canteens and bars on the side.
14	But even so, I was satisfied.\nBecause I was still dancing, still\nliving the life I'd dreamed of.
15	It wasn't a glamorous or an easy life,\nbut as long as I had my dancing and\na friend like Harghal, I was still happy.
16	But as it turned out...\nHarghal didn't feel the same way.
17	It wasn't long before she got sick of\nour new situation. She said she'd had\nenough of dancing, and left Argentum.
18	What was Harghal so dissatisfied by?
19	No point asking me.\nI gave up thinking about her\na long time ago.
20	Then do you at least have some\nidea where she might have gone?\nWe need to find her.
21	She said she was going back to live\nwith her family in Alba Cavanich.
22	In Mor Ardain... I guess we'll have\nto ask around there next.
23	Tell me one thing, Krujah.
24	You haven't given up dancing,\nhave you?
25	Not just yet.
26	I believe your passion for dancing\nand the friendship you shared are\nboth strong and enduring.
27	So if Harghal comes back someday,\ncould you find it in your heart to\nwelcome her?
28	...You know, talking to you has given\nme a bit of perspective on things.
29	I get part of me does still wish I could\ngo back to dancing with her.
30	So...all right.\nI'll give her one more chance.
31	Now that's the kind of friendship\nI like to see!
32	Hahah... Good luck convincing her.
33	If she still cares about dancing at all,\nyou bring her back here.
34	Harghal was an incredible dancer -\neveryone's darling, Bana's favorite.
35	And then she betrayed me and just left!\nI couldn't care less about that skank!
qst200206_ms.json
1	Harghal went back to live with\nher family in Alba Cavanich.
2	I don't know where she lived exactly,\nbut her family aren't rich, so maybe\nthat will point you in the right direction.
3	If you do find her, let her know\nhow I'm doing, OK?
4	How shall we convince her?
5	With a passionate soul
6	With a soul of justice
7	With a kind soul
8	She was an incredible dancer -\neveryone's darling, Bana's favorite.
9	And then she betrayed me and just left!\nI couldn't care less about that skank!
qst200207_ms.json
1	Are you Harghal's mother?
2	What's this all of a sudden?\nWho are you, anyway?
3	Don't worry, madam, we're just\nlooking to ask a few questions.
4	Hmph. Still sounds plenty\nsuspicious to me.
5	If you're debt collectors, you're\nbarking up the wrong tree.\nWe don't have any money to pay!
6	Unless you want to kill me and\ntake my whole damn house!
7	That's not what we're here for.\nWe just wanted you to tell us a\nlittle about Harghal.
8	Hah! Why should I care about\nthat hussy of a daughter?
9	She just ups and does whatever she\npleases, never a thought for her old\nmother's worries!
10	Isn't it your daughter you're\nreally worried about?
11	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Oh, shut up!
12	What does a stranger like you\nknow about our troubles?!
qst200208_ms.json
1	For some reason when I see that\npassionate look in your eyes,\nit reminds me of my husband...
2	Where is your husband now?
3	Oh, he went out to war a long\nwhile back. Got himself killed.
4	All he left behind for me and Harghal\nwas a pile of debt.
5	And I've always been sickly, so I\ncan't do much in the way of work.
6	So naturally we struggled to get by,\nand the debts just kept piling up.
7	It can't be easy raising a kid on your\nown, even without all that debt.
8	Then to make things worse, Harghal\nstarted saying she wanted to be a\ndancer instead of finding a proper job!
9	We wound up quarreling pretty\nmuch every day over that.
10	In the end, she got so sick of our\nlife of poverty, she gave up on me\nand just left home entirely.
11	And that's how she became one\nof Bana's dancing girls...
12	In the end, apparently she did\npretty well for herself.
13	She even sent money home every\nmonth for my medical bills.
14	Not that I did anything to deserve it...
15	I was never a good mother to her.\nI couldn't even support her when\nshe tried to follow her dream.
16	I was so ashamed of myself for\nfailing to make my daughter happy,\nI could hardly bear it.
17	Deep down, all I ever wanted was for\nher to be happy. I wanted her to be\nable to dance to her heart's content.
18	But I was never anything but a\nhindrance to her. With me around,\nhappiness was always out of her reach.
19	Sometimes I wonder if she'd be better\noff if I weren't around any more...
20	You idiot!
21	You really think your daughter would\nbe happy if you threw your life away?
22	You're her mother, for crying out loud!\nThe only family she has!
23	You're the only person in this world\nwho can look after her!
24	If you really care about your daughter...
25	Isn't it your job to watch over her\nand make a life together with her\nas best you can?
26	Yes...you're right, of course.\nI'm just setting a bad example for her,\nbeing so weak.
27	Really, I should be the one standing\nby her side no matter what.
28	If she ever comes home, I want\nto give her a proper apology.
29	And I'll ask her if she'd like to\nstay here and live together again.
30	That's more like it.
31	Oh, yes, that reminds me...\nI haven't seen Harghal in a long time,\nbut she did send a letter recently.
32	A letter?
33	"I have a big deal going down in the\nOld City of Teddim. Soon I'll have a\nlarge sum of money."
34	"Once I have the cash, I'll come home."\nThat's what it said.
35	But I haven't heard anything since,\nso I don't know what happened...
36	That's a bit worrying...
37	Listen... I know it's not my place\nto ask this, but...
38	If my daughter's doing anything dodgy,\ncould you set her straight for me?
39	Of course. I'll do whatever I can!
40	If my burning heart of justice can't\nset your daughter on the straight and\nnarrow, nothing can!
41	Right. Let's head to the Old City of\nTeddim and find this Harghal girl.
42	Don't be too harsh on her, all right?
43	I told you, I don't know or care where\nthat hussy might be! Now scram!
qst200209_ms.json
1	That letter from Harghal still\nworries me...
2	"I have a big deal going down in the\nOld City of Teddim. Soon I'll have a\nlarge sum of money."
3	"Once I have the cash, I'll come home."\nThat's what it said.
4	Please find her for me.
5	How shall we convince her?
6	With a passionate soul
7	With a soul of justice
8	With a kind soul
9	I told you, I don't know or care\nabout her! Now scram!
qst200210_ms.json
1	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Somebody! Anybody!\nPlease help Jaruru!
2	[ML:Feeling ]Do I hear a voice crying out for help...?
3	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Over here! Please save Jaruru!
4	Hang on! I'll be there in a jiffy!
qst200211_ms.json
1	Thank friends for saving!\nJaruru very grateful!
2	Think nothing of it!\nI just did what any hero would do.
3	What were you doing in a dangerous\nplace like this anyway?
4	Hm? Oh...just merchant business.
5	Oh, you're a traveling merchant?
6	What kind of goods do you sell?
7	Go on, let's have a look. We might\nbe able to give you some custom!
8	Urk... J-Jaruru not have any\nwares right now.
9	What? You're a traveling merchant\nwith nothing to sell?
10	Meh-meh-meh!\nNasty monsters stole all of wares!
11	They did what?!\nWell, that's not good at all!
12	The monsters we just beat up didn't\nseem to be carrying anything, though...
13	W-well, ummm...
14	Is it just me, or is this Nopon\nacting reeeeeally suspicious?
15	Yes, I get the feeling he may be\nhiding something. Let's see if we\ncan't get it out of him.
qst200212_ms.json
1	How shall we convince him?
2	With a passionate soul
3	With a soul of justice
4	With a kind soul
5	Meh-meh-meh!\nJaruru know nothing!\nNothing at all!
qst200213_ms.json
1	So you see, girl called Harghal hire\nJaruru to come here and collect\nthree type of medicine herb.
2	Harghal?!
3	And do you know what these\nherbs are for?
4	Herbs for making special Pollen Orb!\nMake body fill with twice as much\nenergy as usual!
5	Ah, one of those old Nopon\nconcoctions...
6	I believe those are contraband in\na number of nations, are they not?
7	What? They're illegal?
8	Pollen Orbs are known for their\naddictive nature. Excessive use can\ncause terrible effects to the body.
9	As such, I seem to recall trading\nin them is entirely forbidden\nthroughout Mor Ardain.
10	Friends quite right...
11	Harghal know that Pollen Orb\ntrading forbidden, but sell for\nhigh price anyway.
12	I see...\nThank you for your honesty, Jaruru.
13	Jaruru overcome with guilt at sight\nof flame of justice in eyes of friend.\nNot take on dirty job like this again!
14	Could you tell us where these\ndeals are taking place? Harghal\nshould be there, right?
15	Jaruru not know where Harghal is now.
16	But plan was to sneak herbs in among\nother cargo and have sailor at Port\nAnangham transport them.
17	Port Anangham, huh...\nDo you know this sailor's name?
18	Name of Tuvarri.
19	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]All right, then!\nTuvarri, we're coming for you!
20	Look me in the eyes!\nThese are the eyes of justice!
21	Now, tell me honestly. Are you really\njust a traveling merchant?
22	J-Jaruru not doing anything\nsuspicious...
23	Are you sure?\nCan you swear on your own soul?!
24	Meh-meh-meh-mehhhhh....!
25	If there's something going on here,\nwe need to know about it.
26	Don't worry. No matter what the\nsituation, we won't treat you unfairly.\nI'm here to help!
27	Meh-meh-mehhhhh...\nAll right...
28	Jaruru tell friends everything...
qst200214_ms.json
1	You're Tuvarri, right?\nJaruru told us about you.
2	Oh, Jaruru sent you?\nPerfect timing.
3	I was just running into a bit of a snag.\nWe don't have enough cargo - could\nyou go and fetch some more for me?
4	Excuse me?! I would never collude\nin illegal smuggl-
5	Shh! Shhhhhh!\nHang on a moment, Godfrey!
6	What is the matter, Nia?\nI was just about to set this man\non the straight and...
7	Look, Godfrey. We don't even know\nif this guy knows about the smuggling\nyet, do we? He could be innocent!
8	What?! An innocent man?!
9	Jaruru said the herbs would be hidden\nin regular cargo, right? Let's play dumb\nfor now and see where he takes them.
10	Urghhh... I suppose that does\nfollow a certain logic...
11	You can count on us to pick up the\ncargo, Mr. Tuvarri. What exactly do\nyou need us to fetch?
12	Let's see... We're missing two Titanic\nCraniums, and five Ancient Chalices.
13	If you don't have any handy, you\nshould be able to find them by\nsalvaging. But make it quick!
14	Guaaaaarghhhhh!\nThis doesn't sit right with me at all!!!
15	Wh-what the hell?!\nIs this guy all right, shouting out\nall of a sudden like that?!
16	Don't worry, it's nothing!\nWe'll be right back!
qst200215_ms.json
1	We're missing two Titanic Craniums\nand five Ancient Chalices.
2	Bring them here quick, all right?
qst200216_ms.json
1	All right, that should do nicely!\nRight in time for me to set sail.
2	Wouldn't want to keep the\nclient waiting.
3	Where are you taking this\ncargo exactly?
4	Genbu Port in Tantal.
5	Do you know the client personally?
6	Ships like mine transport all sorts of\ndifferent goods from a bunch of clients.
7	So I'm afraid I don't really know much\nabout the people I'm working for.
8	I see...
9	Where are you handing over this\ncargo, then?
10	All I do is unload them at the port.\nNone of my business what happens\nafterwards. Why d'you want to know?
11	No, don't worry about it.
12	Well then, I'd better get going.\nThanks for your help!
qst200217_ms.json
1	Looks like Harghal was planning to\nuse Tantal as a base to smuggle\nPollen Orbs out all around the world.
2	Tantal has only recently opened up\nto contact with other nations, after all.
3	Trading procedures are not yet well\nestablished, so suspicious substances\nwould be difficult to trace.
4	Trying to conduct shady business\nin my homeland, eh? I'll be having\nnone of that!
5	This Harghal girl should be showing\nup in Genbu Port to collect the goods,\nso we'll catch her in the act!
6	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Haaaahhhhhhh!\nI will pass judgment on every last\nvillain involved in this crooked affair!
qst200218_ms.json
1	So if we wait here, Harghal ought\nto show up, right?
2	That is the hope.\nLet us have faith in our plan!
3	...I don't see any girls showing up.
4	You don't think we have been tricked?
5	Hmmmm... I don't know about that.
6	Maybe she's cautious enough\nnot to show herself unless she\nabsolutely has to.
7	I guess we'd better try asking\nan informant for more info.
8	To Theosoir's black market it is, then.
9	The black market... That would be a\nplace where villains do business, right?\nCan I rain sweet justice upon them?
10	You can not!\nWhat are you, an idiot?!
11	Listen, Godfrey, it may be called a\nblack market, but it's not actually\nthat bad of a place.
12	If the black market disappeared from\nTheosoir, the people really would\nstarve to death.
13	Really?
14	Really. There's plenty of upstanding\nfolk doing business there too. They just\ndon't have official permission, that's all.
15	A necessary evil for people to live...
16	Guohhhhhh!\nThe notion pains me so!
qst200220_ms.json
1	We're looking for an Ardainian woman\nnamed Harghal. She's been smuggling\nPollen Orb ingredients into Tantal.
2	Do you know anything about her?
3	Sure, I know her. You don't see\nmany Ardainian women around\nthese parts, after all.
4	I believe her cargo was taken to over\nnear the Old Gelgemos Gate.
5	Seems like she's making something\nover there.
6	Pollen Orbs, right?
7	Perhaps, perhaps...\nI'm afraid I don't have any sources\non the precise details.
8	I see. Well, thanks for the help.
9	The Old Gelgemos Gate, huh...?\nI guess it would be quickest to go\nvia Genbu Drifts.
10	Sounds about right. At any rate,\nlooks like we're finally getting close\nto catching this Harghal girl!
11	Yeah! Not long until we get to see\nher in person! Let's do this!
qst200221_ms.json
1	So, we meet at last.\nYou must be Harghal!
2	And you are?\nNew couriers or something?
3	We are no such thing!\nI am an ally of justice, come to\nset you on the path of righteousness!
4	Uhhh... What are you on about?
5	We have heard all about you, Harghal!\nTell me, why would you stoop to\nsmuggling Pollen Orbs?!
6	...?!
7	What's wrong?\nWhy the sudden silence?
8	...
9	Why do you avert your eyes?\nIs there something you are still hiding?
10	Something doesn't seem right here...
11	Hmm... It would appear this girl is\nusing the Pollen Orbs as ingredients\nto create something else.
12	What's going on here, Harghal?!\nAre you not smuggling Pollen Orbs\nafter all?!
13	Tell us what you are hiding!
14	...
15	You're a stubborn one.
16	Very well! I'll pull out all the stops!
qst200222_ms.json
1	Harghal, what are you doing in a place\nlike this? You can tell me everything.
2	I know you are not the kind of girl\nwho would resort to crime lightly.
3	Those eyes of yours...\nThey're just like my old dad's.
4	All right, all right. I'll talk.
5	I was using the Pollen Orbs to make\nan even more potent substance.\nA beverage I call...Bolla Bolla!
6	But for what purpose?
7	Eating Pollen Orbs is mostly a Nopon\nthing, right? But if I intensify the effect,\nhumans will get hooked on it too.
8	That's a most terrifying idea\nyou have there...
9	...
10	What's wrong, Harghal?\nGo on, you can tell us the rest.
11	No...I've already said too much.\nPlease, just go away.
12	Sorry, but I don't have anything\nmore to say to you people.
qst200223_ms.json
1	Harghal, why are you mixing yourself\nup in all this shady business?
2	Everyone's worried about you.\nYour old friend Krujah.\nYour own mother!
3	...I need the money. That's all.
4	If this plan works out, I'll be able\nto make a mountain of cash.
5	A single can of Bolla Bolla has the\npower of ten Pollen Orbs, you know?
6	All sorts of people would pay a high\nprice for such a potent drink.
7	Even without Bana, I won't have to\nworry about money any more.
8	Why is money so important to you?!
9	Why is money important?!\nMoney is everything in this world!
10	Without money, you can't get anything\nfor yourself. Least of all happiness.
11	If you met my mother, you should\nknow that. She needs money just to\nstop her sickness from killing her!
12	And where do you get off, anyway?!\nGoing on about your precious "justice"!
13	I know smuggling isn't something to be\nproud of! But what choice do I have?!
14	It's the only way I can get\nthe money I need!
15	Do you really believe earning money\nin this way will bring you happiness?!
16	Will dirty money really buy happiness\nfor the people you care about?!
qst200224_ms.json
1	But of course it can buy happiness.\nMoney is money, dirty or otherwise.
2	And with enough money, you can\nsolve any problem!
3	You...!
4	It's been a while, my dear Godfrey.
5	Oh, I get it now. So you were the one\nwho led this poor girl astray.
6	Yes, I showed her a way forward.\nBut "leading astray"? I don't think so.
7	I only advised her to follow\nwhat was in her heart.
8	Money is what she needs to turn her\nlife around! It is her salvation!
9	Money is salvation?
10	That's right, Godfrey.\nYou can't save anyone with your\nprecious "justice" alone.
11	Because greed is the foundation\nof humanity!
12	Given the chance, all humans would\nsacrifice others to fulfill the greed\nthat lurks in their hearts!
13	To follow one's own desires and do\nwhatever it takes to fulfill them...\nThat is the path to salvation!
14	I've had enough of your nonsense!\nThat's not salvation, it's madness!
15	Every person has the potential\nto live a proud and just life, even\nwithout money!
16	Well, I'd love to stay here and debate\nall day, but I must dash. There's a big\nevent about to go down in Theosoir.
17	In Theosoir?\nWhat are you plotting this time?!
18	Oh, nothing much. I just fed a little\nBolla Bolla to the monsters in the area.
19	With ten times the energy, they were\nall too eager to go on a rampage.
20	What?! You never said\nanything about that!
21	What's the problem?
22	This is the perfect opportunity to\nadvertise your new product's potency.
23	Even giant monsters love the taste!\nBolla Bolla, the drink that makes you\nfeel like a king! On sale now!
24	Trust me, it'll do wonders for\nyour bottom line. And isn't that\nwhat you wanted?
25	I...I didn't...
26	Just how far do you have to go\nbefore you're satisfied, villain?!
27	Having a little trouble keeping our\ntemper in check, are we, Godfrey?
28	But do you have the time to waste\nhere shouting at me?
29	Who knows how many people are\ngetting hurt in Theosoir right now...
30	Curse you! I'll deal with you later...\nDon't you think you can hide from me!
qst200225_ms.json
1	Dammit, the town is-!
2	Are we too late?!
3	There's no time to talk!\nLet's dash!
4	Heeeeeeelp!
5	Hey - hang in there!
6	Th-thank you...
7	Can you run?
8	S-sure!
9	OK, then run.\nRun away, fast as you can!
10	No hanging around! If anyone's not out yet,\nwe find them and we GET them out!
qst200226_ms.json
1	Don't worry, you're safe now!
2	Thank you!
3	Can you run?
4	Uh-huh!
5	Then go! Fast as you can!
qst200227_ms.json
1	Are you all right?!
2	Yeah...thanks! You saved me!
3	Hurry up and get out of here!
qst200228_ms.json
1	I was so scared...
2	You've been a very brave boy.\nBut you can leave the rest to us!
3	Please...save Theosoir!
4	You can count on me!\nI swear on my fist of justice!
qst200229_ms.json
1	Just in the nick of time!
2	Thank you, my dear...
3	No need for thanks!\nJust get yourself to a safe location!
qst200230_ms.json
1	Well, this is quite the big fella.
2	Looks like this is the last one.
3	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Haaaaaahhhhhh!!!\nLet's do this, guys!
qst200231_ms.json
1	Impressive, Godfrey.
2	Huh?!
3	You have done better than anyone could have hoped.
4	But... You get it now, don't you?
5	Just look at all this...
6	All of it, come to pass because\nof that girl.
7	She needed money to save\nher sick mother.
8	She chose to do it through the thing that\nshe loved most: dancing.
9	What I'm saying is,\nshe did the right thing for the right reasons.
10	But greed was her undoing...
11	Enticed by a way to make even more money...\nShe caused this.
12	The justice you believe in so strongly...crumbles so\nvery easily when faced with simple human desires.
13	People can do terrible things\nin the name of justice!
14	Ohhh... Put a sock in it, will ya?
15	Do you think I'm an idiot?\nGive me a break.
16	Blaming all of this on the poor girl?\nTelling me there ain't no justice?
17	You are the deluded one.
18	All of this is your fault, and yours alone!
19	You are just leading people into disaster\nfor your own amusement!
20	Heh! All I ever did was to\ngive them a gentle nudge...
21	I am done talkin' with ya.\nIt's time to put 'em up!
22	Gird your loins for a nice big taste of\nsteaming justice!
qst200232_ms.json
1	You get it now?!
2	Justice! Never! Loses!
3	...Well, I guess he can't really hear me.
4	I...I can't believe it...\nAll this happened because of me...
5	Don't turn away! You need to look at\nwhat you've done and accept it!
6	All I wanted was to make my mother\nwell again and give her a good life...
7	How did it end up like this...?
8	That villain took advantage\nof your feelings...
9	That villain took advantage\nof your feelings...
10	That villain saw in your feelings an\nopportunity, and took advantage...
11	That villain twisted your pure feelings\ninto something awful.
12	I wanted my mother to be well again...
13	For the sake of saving her, I thought\nI could justify anything...
14	But I was wrong. There's no\nforgiving what I've done.
15	All I can do now is give up\nmy life in repentance...!
16	You idiot!
17	You really think dying is going\nto make anything right?!\nYou're stronger than that!
18	If you're really sorry for what you've\ndone, then make up for it by helping\npeople instead of hurting them!
19	Or what, you think your mother and\nKrujah would want you to throw\nyour life away?
20	Now, eyes up front!
21	If you really have the will to repent,\nI'll help you through it all!
22	Ahhhh...\nAaaahhhhh...
23	I'm...so sorry...\nThank you...so much...
24	I guess it's not easy to follow\nthe path of justice...
25	It's easy to talk about justice,\nbut actually following through...\nthat can't be easy.
26	The path of justice is a difficult one...
27	There's a lot of weight behind that\nlittle word "justice"...
28	Justice isn't that complicated.\nIt's pretty simple, really.
29	It's just that everyone thinks too\nhard about it, so they lose sight\nof what really matters.
30	So I figure my job is to forge a\nshining path to stop people from\nlosing their way!
31	I'm counting on you to help me\nwith that, partner!
qst200233_ms.json
1	Friends looking for Harghal?\nMe not seen her since Bana go away...
2	If you want know more about Harghal,\nme suggest ask girl called Krujah.\nShe work at Rumbletum Canteen.
3	Krujah was good friend of Harghal,\ndoing same job. She probably know\nmore about where Harghal go.
qst200234_ms.json
1	How shall we convince her?
2	With a passionate soul
3	With a soul of justice
4	With a kind soul
5	Sorry, but I don't have anything\nmore to say to you people.
6	I'm afraid I don't have anything\nmore to tell you.
7	It can't be...
8	The city's being...\nBecause of me...?
qst200301_ms.json
1	Hm?
2	Aaargh!
3	Groaargh!
4	Aaahh!
5	Finally...calm...
6	That's not what I'd call it...
7	Is he OK?
8	I'd say he looks scared speechless...
9	Ah... No...\nI... I didn't...
10	Are you all right?
11	Yes...\nI'm sorry. I'm fine.
12	You looked like you were in a hurry.\nWhat's the rush?
13	Huh?\nOh crap! I forgot!
14	There was an accident!\nI-I have to go get help!
15	An accident?!
16	Near the Genbu Drifts.\nWe do some mining there.
17	There was a rockfall.\nPeople are trapped down in the tunnels!
18	Rest of us tried to shift the rocks, but\nit was no use.
19	So I ran to get help, but...
20	You need...rocks...moved?
21	Ahhhh!\nThe monster can talk!
22	Hey, relax.
23	Wulfric isn't a monster. He's a Blade.
24	There is no cause for alarm.
25	He probably won't eat you,\nso settle down.
26	Does that mean you're Drivers?
27	Yeah, so what?
28	This is great!\nYou've gotta help me!
29	Graaagh!
30	I'll...do it!
31	Wh-what?\nWhy did he run off like that?
32	Wulfric, wait for us!
33	Is he heading for the mines?
34	It's not like we were going to refuse, anyway!\nCome on, everyone, let's go!
qst200302_ms.json
1	The rockfall's happened at Zalmor's\nCrevice, near the Genbu Drifts.
2	Please! Go save my friends!\nThey'll be doomed without you!
3	To think the rockfall was caused\nby a Gogol... I can hardly believe it.
4	We just had a Gogol show up\nright here in Theosoir, you see.\nWent on a proper rampage.
5	I'm afraid I don't know where\nit's got to now, though...
6	You could try asking around the city?
7	It looks like the Gogol fled the city.
8	Maybe you could try tracking\nit down by its footprints?
9	If it's the same Gogol that's been\ncausing rockfalls and attacking cities,\nwe can't just leave it running loose.
10	You have to defeat that Gogol\nso we can live in safety again!
qst200303_ms.json
1	Wulfric, there!\nThat's where the rocks fell.
2	There's people in there? Cripes.
3	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]I'll help now!
4	[ML:Feeling ]We should hurry too!
5	Obviously!
qst200304_ms.json
1	I think I'm all right...just about.
2	If it weren't for that big Blade, though,\nI'd have been a goner.
3	Thank you so much.
4	I can't believe a Gogol caused\nthis whole mess...
5	I hope you'll find that thing and make\nsure it doesn't hurt anyone again.
qst200305_ms.json
1	Is this everyone?
2	Not sure. Wulfric is checking inside.
3	Thank you.
4	Phew, you really saved our skins there, mate.
5	If that big fella hadn't been around,\nwe'd never have shifted those rocks.
6	What?\nMore rocks?!
7	From where?
8	Are they...aimed at us?!
9	It's too dangerous!\nWe have to get out of here!
10	Nia!
11	[ML:undisp ]
12	Wulfric?!
13	Hurry... Get out of here!
14	Hey, look over there!\nA Gogol!
15	That's the bastard who caused the rockslide!
16	So that is the culprit?
17	If we don't move, we're gonna get buried alive again!
18	Run!
19	Graaaagh!
20	Come here!\nWe will...have...words!
21	Wait up! Wulfric!
22	*sigh* Why does he have to keep running off like that?
qst200306_ms.json
1	Where is it?
2	Did it run off somewhere else?
3	...Was definitely here, meh.
4	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Behind us?!
5	Ooorghaaaah!
6	Why attack?!
7	Ghwaaaarr!
8	Stop! Be calm!
9	Waaaaagh!
10	It won't listen!
qst200307_ms.json
1	The Gogol's getting away!
2	Stop! Don't run!
3	Wulfric, you stop too!
4	We must keep together!\nIt's too dangerous!
5	No use, meh.\nWulfric not listen...
6	Well, fine. Let's get after 'em!
qst200308_ms.json
1	...Where is it?
2	Where's the Gogol?
3	Not here!\nIt vanished!
4	It seems we've lost it...
5	No wonder.\nOur opponent is plenty nimble.
6	There aren't even any clues...
7	I'll search!\nI will find it!
8	Calm down, Wulfric.\nBlind rage gains us nothing.
9	It would be better to return to Theosoir\nfor now, give Evart an update.
10	That makes sense.\nWe can look for the Gogol later.
11	Coming, Wulfric?
12	...Mrgh.
qst200309_ms.json
1	Say what?\nDid I see a Gogol?
2	I saw something. But it scared me\nsenseless, so I didn't dare get up...
3	Admittedly... I didn't get a proper look,\nso I couldn't tell you more about it...
4	Although come to think of it, it seemed\npretty slight for a Gogol, maybe...?
5	Still, it's pretty darn rare for a Gogol to\nappear in town, you know?
6	Clever buggers, them Gogols are,\nso they usually know better than to\nwander into peopled areas.
7	There's probably some reason for it,\nI expect.
8	Now, that's about all I know.
9	If you need more,\nask some other folks!
qst200310_ms.json
1	About the Gogol?
2	It grabbed me suddenly and took me\nto the roof! The brute!
3	I thought it would be the end of me!
4	It didn't really hurt me though,\nbut still...
5	You know, you'd have thought someone\nwould have got injured, what with all\nthe commotion it caused.
6	Even the building avoided\nany major damage.
7	Talk about silver linings, huh?
8	Anyway! However you look at it,\nI hope someone chases the monster\naway, and soon!
qst200311_ms.json
1	The Gogol?
2	I did bump into it by the main gate.\nLiterally? No, not literally.
3	Ah, it was fine though.\nIt didn't do anythin', just sorta ran off.
4	If you could find its tracks, you could\nprobably follow 'em easy enough.
5	Mind you, Gogols are timid creatures.
6	They don't normally attack people.
7	I think it's just confused after Tantal's\nisolation ended and people started\ndigging for salt everywhere...
8	That's probably why it\nwandered into town all of a sudden.
qst200312_ms.json
1	The trail is still clear.\nWe'll be able to track it, no problem.
2	Yes!\nIt will be caught!
qst200313_ms.json
1	There's the Gogol!
2	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Grroarr!
3	[ML:Feeling ]Wulfric, hold up!\nYou can't fight it alone!
4	It attacked the town!\nMade townspeople scared!
5	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]I WILL capture it!
6	[ML:Feeling ]Wulfric, stop!
7	...It's no use.\nWe'll just have to jump in!
qst200314_ms.json
1	Stop struggling!\nYou cannot win!
2	It's definitely smaller than the one\nwe fought before.
3	In which case,\nwhere is that one hiding...?
4	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Ah?!
5	You! From before!
6	[ML:Feeling ]So there are two!
7	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Ghraaaaah!
8	[ML:Feeling ]They are siblings!
9	Siblings?\nYou sure, Wulfric?
10	I am sure.\nThis one is older.
11	Came to rescue its brother!
12	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Oogah! Ghraaaaaa!
13	[ML:Feeling ]Here it comes, Wulfric!
14	Ready!
qst200315_ms.json
1	Friend?
2	I think not...
3	Waaauuugh!
4	Yeaarrrgh!
5	Waaauuugh!
qst200316_ms.json
1	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Guooooo!
2	[ML:Feeling ]Why do you still fight?
3	Wait. Are you the mother?
4	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Graaaaaou!
5	[ML:Feeling ]I see, you keep them safe...
6	That's the mother?\nSo it's a Gogol family?!
7	I see! So they were all living\nin Zalmor's Crevice!
8	And they only caused the rockfall\nto protect their home...
9	So the rampage in Theosoir was also\nmeant to warn people off...
10	Clever beasts...
11	After the isolation policy was lifted,\nTantal needed resources to export,\nso they dug all those salt mines.
12	But that in turn endangered the animals\nand their natural habitats...
13	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Gwahr...!
14	[ML:Feeling ]No more fighting.\n...Apologies.
15	Grrrh?
16	You.\nAttack humans no more.
17	I will speak to humans.
18	They will cede your home.
19	You will live in peace once more.
20	...
21	Did monster get all that?
22	If not the words, I think they at least\ngot the intentions...
23	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Oogrrah!
24	[ML:Feeling ]It seems it did, Wulfric.
25	The people will be safe.
26	That's right. It's over now.
27	Let's head back to Theosoir,\nbring Evart the good news!
qst200317_ms.json
1	Oh, hey! It's you guys!
2	We saved them.\nThey're safe!
3	Thank you! You're a good sort!\nDespite your appearance...
4	But the Gogol...got away.\nApologies.
5	The...Gogol?
6	Ah, the rockfall was caused by\na Gogol, actually. But it kinda\ngot away from us...
7	What? Are you being serious?!
8	'Cos one of them showed up here\njust a moment ago and started going\ncrazy!
9	What?!
10	Are you certain?
11	Yeah! I know what I saw!\nIt went after the workers...
12	It grabbed a girl and climbed to\nthe top of the tower, making a\nterrible racket as it went...
13	I'm telling you, it was a mess!\nLuckily, Tantalese soldiers were here to\nchase it off, so damage was minimal...
14	What the hell? It pretended to\nrun away, then attacked the town?!
15	Grrah! Unforgivable!\nI will hunt the Gogol down!
16	...One moment, Wulfric.
17	...Grrm?\nWhat about the hunt?!
18	Mòrag, what's up?\nThought of something?
19	Mmm...\nI can't make sense of it.
20	The Gogol did not run in the direction\nof the town, nor could it have\nclimbed the pillar.
21	It may be quick, but could it have really\nattacked the town from there?
22	...Grh?
23	You make a good point.\n...Let's look around a bit.
24	Wulfric, the hunt can wait. First,\nlet's talk to the townspeople.
25	...Hrmgh.
qst200318_ms.json
1	Oh! You're back!
2	How did it go?\nHa! Like I even have to ask!
3	Actually...
4	Hey, everyone!
5	That Blade and Drivers I told you about\nkilled the Gogol!
6	No. Listen...
7	Whoa!\nIt'll be smooth diggin' from here on in!
8	No more being afraid of the Gogol\ncoming for me when I sleep!
9	Excellent! Excellent!\nYou are my hero, lad!
10	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Wrrrrraaaagh!
11	Ah?!
12	[ML:Feeling ]W-w-what's gotten into you?!
13	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Listen to me!
14	[ML:Feeling ]Gogol is not dead.\nIt roams free.
15	It roams free?!
16	What did you do?!
17	How could you!\nWhat if it comes back for us?!
18	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]You're wrong!
19	[ML:Feeling ]They will not do that.
20	You people...\nYou threaten the Gogols' home.
21	They attack to protect family.
22	Violence solves nothing.\nI scolded the Gogols.
23	But destroying habitat is your fault.
24	Wulfric must scold you too!
25	...
26	...I am no hero.
27	The Gogol who protects family is.
28	You must understand this.
29	You must live in peace with the Gogols.
30	Please. No more robbing\nGogols' home!
31	...Wulfric... Nice one.
32	...Wulfric... Wow.
33	...Wulfric... Well said.
34	...Wulfric... Well said.
35	...Right you are!
36	We'll make sure to stop digging there.\nI'll convince our management!
37	Truly?
38	Yeah. After that speech, we can't just\nvery well do nothing, right?
39	I mean, we'd get pretty mad if someone\nstarted tearing up our homes!
40	Treat the Gogols as you'd have\nthem treat you, that's all.
41	You all agree, right?
42	Sure, no issues here.\nWe heard you, loud and clear.
43	Say, Wulfric...
44	You didn't just save us,\nbut the Gogols, too.
45	I think you are a hero, after all!
46	...Me, a hero?
47	Good going, Wulfric!\nLooks like you got through to everyone!
48	Awesome, Wulfric!\nLooks like everyone listened!
49	Well done, Wulfric.\nIt seems your words have been heard.
50	Sweet, Wulfric!\nSeems people listen to you now!
51	I was accepted?\nMe?
52	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Yaaooouuuuuu!
qst200401_ms.json
1	Come on, Ellenora!\nTime to pay up!
2	I-I'm sorry, but I'll\nneed another day or two...
3	I'm gettin' awful tired\nof hearin' that line.
4	How long're you gonna\nkeep us waitin'? Huh?
5	B-but I don't have the money...\nPlease, just give me time...
6	Yeah, no.\nYour time's already up.
7	If she can't pay, she can't pay.\nHey, I've got an idea...
8	...Huh.\nShouldn't we do something?
9	Yeah, we can't let them\nget away with this...
10	Whuh?\nPerceval, what the-?!
11	Shove off!
12	...You should leave here.
13	I do as I please, gutter trash!
14	Gwah-!
15	H-h-he's strong all right...\nWe're outmatched here...
16	I say again: leave.\nI will not repeat myself further...
17	...Dammit!\nWe'll meet again!
qst200402_ms.json
1	Everything OK?\nAre you hurt?
2	Y-yes, I mean, no, I mean...\nI'm fine.
3	Thank you ever so much\nfor your help.
4	Can I just ask, what was their deal?
5	They, ah, came to collect on a loan...
6	One day at work, I accidentally caused\na wealthy patron to be injured.
7	They made me cover the medical fees,\nwhich put me in significant debt...
8	The person I borrowed from was not\na nice man, and the interest kept\nmounting up...
9	I gave them everything I earned, but\nstill my debt kept increasing.
10	Right, right... That explains why\nthose goons were all over you.
11	If this keeps up, I won't have enough\nto live on, much less pay them back...
12	I don't know what the point of living is,\nanymore...
13	Don't talk like that!\nIt sure as hell beats dying, I can\ntell you that much.
14	Yeah, what Nia said.
15	While there's life, there's hope...\nOr something like that.
16	It's too soon to give up just yet.
17	Exactly.\nWe'll do what we can to help you\nrepay the debt.
18	You would...?\nThank you, oh, thank you!
19	For now, you should probably go home\nand rest. You're looking a bit pale...
20	OK. If you think that's best...
21	I live close by here. Please, do let me\nknow if you learn anything...
22	Yeah, leave it to us.
23	Thank you, once again...\nBe well, friends.
24	...Right. Now then.\nShall we ask around about this\nloan shark person?
25	...Would you mind waiting a moment?
26	What's up, Perceval?
27	My intuition tells me...
28	...that this is no simple dispute among\ncivilians. I feel there is more at play...
29	I wish to be part of this investigation.
30	This is quite something, coming\nfrom you, Perceval.
31	Why not? Let's split up and\nsearch for clues.
32	And once we've asked around, let's\nmeet back up at Ellenora's. OK?
33	Understood.
qst200403_ms.json
1	A loan shark?\nHuh... No clue.
2	But there's definitely dudes here that\nyou shouldn't tangle with.
3	They've been going around town lately,\npretend-hurting themselves to extort\nmoney from hardworking people.
4	What's worse though is that there's a\ndoctor working with them, "charging"\nthe "injured" stupidly high fees.
5	You'd do well to steer well clear of\nthat kind of noise, fellas!
qst200404_ms.json
1	The loan shark?\nNah man, I wouldn't borrow money\nfrom him even if you paid me.
2	Why? For one, I hear he's in cahoots\nwith that quack Celian.
3	I understand medical fees, but charging\nan arm and two legs, sending people to\na moneylender if they can't afford it...?
4	That's some evil scary stuff right there.
5	If you need a doctor, whatever you do,\nmake sure you don't go to Celian!
6	Watch out for that quack Celian!
qst200405_ms.json
1	Loan shark, loan shark...\nAh, you must mean Arreth!
2	That guy's been acting suspicious...
3	You wanna know what I saw?
4	I saw Arreth, coming out of the\nOld City of Teddim late one night...
5	Weird, right?!\nI bet he's cooking up some scheme...
qst200406_ms.json
1	Friends want know about loan shark?
2	Sorry, but Gagachi not know anything.\nKeep asking around though.\nMaybe someone else know.
qst200407_ms.json
1	Mmhm... No, I'm sorry, but I don't\nthink I know anything about that.
2	But, yet, however!\nI do have the good fortune of being\nthe owner of a very lucky vase.
3	Wanna come and look?
qst200408_ms.json
1	A moneylender...?
2	Gee, I dunno about that...\n"Buy cash, or do without" is my credo.
3	So, I'm sorry, but I've got places to be.\nMind taking your questions elsewhere?
qst200409_ms.json
1	Hmm... Sorry, I've got nuffin'.
2	I don't know anything about a\nmoneylender.
3	...Oh, hey, but...
4	One hears about some strange things\nhappening to townsfolk recently, so\nyou guys be careful.
qst200410_ms.json
1	Apologies, I don't know anything\nabout that subject.
2	How about you ask Lunatheo?\nHe hears all sorts of gossip.
qst200411_ms.json
1	Have you discovered something?
2	Bits and pieces... After talking to\nthe townsfolk, here's what we know.
3	Pretend-injured blackmailer people\nand doctor name Celian are work\ntogether.
4	Also, the doctor has some secret ties\nto the moneylender, Arreth...
5	We also heard rumors that the medical\nfees he charges are astronomical.
6	Further, the doctor and the lender meet\nat night in the Old City of Teddim...
7	That mean doctor and loan shark\nworking together!
8	It sure sounds like I've been had...
9	But all that's not enough proof\nto get them arrested. Not yet.
10	...Then we must seek other means.
11	We shall visit the old town at night\nand witness them in the act.
12	Evidence thus obtained,\nwe may then judge them fairly.
13	Hm, yeah, that'd be the quickest way...
14	Not sure will go so smooth...
15	We can argue here till the Armu come\nhome, and we'll make no progress.
16	Let's do as Perceval says.\nLet's visit the Old City of Teddim\nat night!
17	It's bound to be dangerous, though.\nEllenora, you should stay home.
18	I will.\nThank you, everyone...
qst200412_ms.json
1	The doctor and the loan shark?
2	So it would appear.
3	It seems there was merit to the hearsay.
4	A doctor is meant to relieve the townsfolk's suffering,\nnot add to it.
5	We can't let this stand...
6	Perceval?!
7	What about the woman?\nWere you able to collect?
8	Oh, there were complications, but we reached\nan agreement. It'll be over soon.
9	Hmph...\nI should say it will.
10	Perceval!
11	Are they dead?
12	No...\nSimply knocked out.
13	If we tie them up, Ardainian guards\ncan collect them later.
14	...That was a fine display, but I will say this.\nJumping in alone was an unnecessary risk.
15	Right, what Mòrag said!\nWhat if there'd been more of them?
16	...It was the right moment. I exercised my judgment.
17	If we had wasted any more time,\nthey could have gotten away...
18	which would in turn lead to the suffering\nof many innocents...
19	That one possibility, but we are comrades!\nShould not forget to use teamwork!
20	...Perceval?
21	Why are you so set\non eradicating evil?
22	...There is evil in this world which the law\nis not equipped to deal with.
23	Many shed tears and even blood\nsuffering in its shadow.
24	When a new lease on life was given to me...
25	I felt a duty to use my power to help\nuplift the downtrodden.
26	As if it were the reason for my existence:\nto punish all evil that lurks in this world.
27	Punish all evil...\nWell, if that doesn't sound noble, I don't know what does!
28	Ah, so that will is where\nall your might stems from...
29	Well, anyhow.\nWe're allies now, right?
30	Trust us to help you!
31	...I'll try.
32	Well, whatever. At least we closed the case.\nNo need for all this scolding, am I right?
33	Ah, but it is not over yet.
34	Say what?
35	We have indeed felled the doctor and the moneylender,\nbut many evildoers involved in the case are still at large.
36	Right...
37	Well, in that case we'd best get to\ntracking them sharpish!
38	No need.
39	Huh?
40	How so?
41	This is my job.
42	It does not seem fair to trouble you all\nany further.
43	Please leave it to me.
44	Um, Perceval?
45	...And he's gone.
46	*sigh* It's like he didn't hear\na single word we said...
qst200413_ms.json
1	I have apprehended all the evildoers\ninvolved in the recent incidents...
2	Consequently, the woman Ellenora\nneed worry about her debt no more.
3	A job very well done, Perceval...\nBut next time, please do not go off\non your own.
4	...I'll see what I can do.
5	You do realize that your actions could\nhave endangered the whole party?
6	And yet, the reason I acted alone was\nprecisely to avoid endangering you...
7	Hey, hey.\nHow about we table this for now.
8	We should hurry up and bring\nEllenora the good news.
9	You're right.\nLet's go and put her mind at ease!
qst200414_ms.json
1	...Ellenora?\nWhat... Why...?
2	Some time has already passed\nsince she last drew breath...
3	B-but...\nWho would...?
4	Whoever it was, they may have left\nclues. We must search thoroughly.
qst200415_ms.json
1	The wound indicates...\na single, deadly blade strike.
2	No signs of struggle...
3	A one-hit kill?
4	I doubt she was even aware\nof any danger.
5	The deed was perpetrated by\na professional killer...
6	That's awful...\nWhat was the point in killing her...?
7	...You. Scum. How long will you\nskulk in the shadows?
8	My, my... The Heartless Judge. How\nlong's it been...twenty-odd years?
9	As I live and breathe...
10	I wondered which Blade could be giving\na ruthless band of assassins like my\nBloody Lobsters trouble...
11	But I never expected that Blade\nwould be you!
12	Causing you trouble?\nWhat are you talking about?
13	Ha!\nNow you're trying to play dumb?
14	You capturing our employers put\npaid to our finely-crafted\nmoneymaking scheme, you know.
15	You've made it clear that you wanted\nto wash your hands of our enterprise,\ndamn you! So why come back now?
16	Could it be that you actually miss\nthe killing? Eh, mister Heartless Judge?
17	...You claim to know my old self, scum?
18	I recognize neither you, nor that\n"Heartless Judge" sobriquet you\nkeep using.
19	I stake no claim to the power over\nlife and death, and I renounce killing.\nI am not the Perceval you knew.
20	Heheh...\nBwahahaha!
21	The man who's killed women and\nchildren without batting an eyelid\nnow renounces killing?
22	Gahahahaha!\nThe irony is too delicious!
23	...I assume this is your handiwork.\nWhy did you kill the woman?
24	...Why?
25	I'm getting paid for it.\nWhat other reason do I need?
26	Your employers have been caught and\njudged, by me. There is no paycheck\nwaiting for you. Is that not so?
27	Hey now, aren't you forgetting\nsomething?
28	Whatever the reason, once you enter\na contract, you have to do the deed.\nThat's the rule, remember?
29	Reputation is everything in this world.\nOr have you forgotten that too...?
30	It's a shame, seeing as you used to be\nthe one who killed not for pay or glory,\nbut because you liked it so much.
31	Man, people sure can change...\nOh yeah, but you're a Blade, right?
32	...Have you said your piece?
33	Chill out, Percy.\nThis was just a warning.
34	This is what's gonna happen if you\nkeep meddling with our work. Got it?
35	You'd better keep it in mind,\nPerceval the Pacifist.
36	What a weirdo...
37	Judging by the technique however,\nhe is a capable swordsman.
38	Certainly not a foe to be taken lightly...
39	...
40	Perceval!\nWhere're you going?!
41	Isn't it obvious...?\nI'm giving chase.
42	That man cannot remain at large...
43	You're gonna avenge Ellenora,\nis that it? And alone, again?
44	The man's grudge is against me, and\nme alone. There is no need for you\nto get involved.
45	Perceval...\nThis has ceased to be your problem.\nIt's our problem now.
46	One that we must join forces\nin solving.
47	That's right, Percy!\nLet us give you a hand!
48	...Very well.
49	Do as you wish, then.
50	Great! Now that's settled, we should\nfind out more about that mook.
51	It might make sense to task the\nmercenaries with collecting intel\non the Bloody Lobsters.
52	If we can predict their next move,\nwe should be able to stop them with\nPerceval's aid...
qst200416_ms.json
1	Pupunin, tell me.\nIs it true you're involved with\nthe Bloody Lobsters?
2	That is gross misunderstanding!\nIt actually opposite! Pupunin fearful\nfor own life!
3	...Explain.
4	There is plot in place to get rid of me,\nto make sure dark secrets of ex-\nChairman Bana stay secret.
5	And so, Bloody Lobsters get employed,\nand life of Pupunin now in danger!
6	Right, I gotcha.\nIt's not that you hired them, it's that\nyou're their next target...
7	Right! Exactly!\nPupunin not sleep a wink from stress!
8	Is possible that friends wish to\nfind Bloody Lobsters?
9	That's right.
10	In that case, please guard Pupunin!
11	Assassins come to kill Pupunin for sure,\nthen friends can capture them!
12	You volunteer to act as bait?
13	It seems like a good idea, but\nalso kinda dangerous.
14	It will be fine, so long as I am here...
15	And, hopefully, you Drivers as well?
16	You know it, Perceval!\nWe'll be there with bells on, and\nwe'll keep Pupunin safe as anything!
17	Life of Pupunin already threatened,\nso act as decoy not big deal!
18	Awesome, sounds like a plan.
19	Me think Bloody Lobsters most likely\ncome in the night.
20	Please assemble in front of den of\nPupunin on Salvage Deck at dead\nof night!
qst200417_ms.json
1	Zzz... Zzz... Snrghzzz...
2	Pupunin sure is a sound sleeper.
3	Is this what "not sleeping a wink"\nlooks like now...?
4	...Quiet now.\nThey're here...
qst200418_ms.json
1	Come to interfere with us again,\nmister Heartless Judge?
2	Where is the man I want?
3	He said to tell you to mind your\nown business.
4	In that case, I will bring you down\nand draw him out...
5	Haha, you can damn well try!
6	Yeagh!
qst200419_ms.json
1	Gahahahaha!
2	Nice one, Perceval!\nI can see that you move just like you did back then.
3	I take back what I said.\nYou have not changed in the slightest.
4	It's just like that time...
5	That time you disobeyed me, betrayed your friends,\nand tried to leave the Bloody Lobsters...
6	Gahahahah!
7	...I don't see what's funny.
8	You don't?\nBut it's exhilarating! The excitement of it!
9	To think we might kill each other again...\nIt thrills me like nothing else!
10	...I thought I told you.
11	I have no recollection of you at all.
12	You won't play along, huh?\nWell, I don't mind.
13	The generous guy that I am,\nI will bury you with my own hands once more!
14	Just like I did 20 years ago!\nGahahaha!
15	Foolish. Under the circumstances,\nyou have no hope of winning.
16	Huh?\nOh, you're relying on friends now?
17	You, Perceval? Really?
18	Ehehe... Well, certainly I would have preferred\nto assassinate you...
19	and with this crowd here, it'd hardly be\na proper assassination.
20	Oh, I suppose I could just wipe out\nthe lot of them too just like you would...
21	There, problem solved!
qst200420_ms.json
1	Ugh... Why the hell won't you end this?!
2	...I am not a killer.\nNot even when it comes to worthless scum like you.
3	...Heh heh heh...\nNot a killer?
4	Stop fooling yourself, boyo...
5	Even if you don't kill me now,\nyou can bet your arse someone will...
6	...Like that woman.\nEveryone dies, sooner or later...
7	Perceval!
8	Your skills... They are made for\nending people's lives!
9	It's like you don't get it...
10	It doesn't matter how many times you're reborn,\na killer is what you are.
11	Need proof? That burning desire you feel\nto kill me now is proof enough!
12	What's wrong?\nDo it!
13	You hate me, don't you?\nYou won't let scum like me live, will you?!
14	You can stop holding back\nand kill me already, Perceval!
15	Do it, and reclaim your past glory!
16	...I will not.
17	Dying here would be too easy\nan end for one such as you.
18	No, you will live, so that you can spend\nthe rest of your life atoning for your sins.
19	That... Isn't that a fate\ncrueler than death...?
20	Perceval, you really are the Heartless Judge...
qst200421_ms.json
1	Well done, friends!\nThank you for saving Pupunin!
2	Pupunin in your debt,\nand will certainly repay...one day!
3	...We only did what's right.\nNo reward is necessary.
4	Hey! Perceval!\nWait, meh!
5	It like Perceval not even listen when we\ntalk about importance of teamwork.
6	Tora and friends follow Perceval!\nPupunin keep up good work!
7	Bye-bye, then!
8	That was a job and a half, wasn't it?
9	But we avenged Ellenora.\nI bet she's happy about that.
10	It was sketchy, but we pulled through.
11	And we got our revenge!\nI'm sure Ellenora'd be pleased.
12	It took a while, but vengeance is ours.
13	I imagine Ellenora is smiling...\nwherever she is.
14	A job well done, Perceval!\nI gotta say, it wasn't easy...
15	But justice is served!\nThat's what Ellenora would've wanted.
16	...It matters not.
17	So long as there are those in need of\njudgment, I will continue to mete it out\nwith this sword.
18	That is all.
qst200422_ms.json
1	Pupunin not here right now.\nIn Indol on business.
2	Was muttering to himself about\ncatering or something.
3	If friends have business with Pupunin,\nshould wait till he come back.
qst200501_ms.json
1	What is it you hope to achieve\nwith this fire, Gorg?
2	Do tell us.
3	To burn the stuff we've collected, of course!
4	Seems a bit of a waste to burn all of this...
5	Ah, it'll be fine.
6	What's this?
7	Aligo are attracted by smells you know.\nIt's a funny thing.
8	If we make skillful use of this, we can get them to come over here...
9	Perhaps...
10	Indeed, the things that we gathered\nearlier are giving off a certain odor.
11	If the smell starts to waft over their way,\nthey'll probably come over this way.
12	If we play it right, we can collect up the\ncargo without having to fight them.
13	Meh... That really enough to bring them?
14	It's fine, it's fine. I know what I'm doing.
15	Now, let's find a good vantage point\nto watch the action unfold!
16	Excellent!
17	Well, maybe we didn't get all of them.\nBut it'll be a lot easier to collect what we need now.
18	Wow!\nGorg a very dependable chap!
19	Well, thanks!\nBut y'know, I'm just doing my regular thing!
qst200502_ms.json
1	Mòrag, would you mind helping in the kitchen?
2	Hmm?\nYou want me to help?
3	Yeah, I'm sure you'd be first rate at this kind of thing.
4	Really?\nWell, I don't have much experience, but I'll do what I can.
5	Tora and Poppi... Could I ask you to get some more ingredients?
6	Yes yes!
7	Please input quantities and products!
8	36 Choice Cherries...and 62 Love Raspberries...
9	102 measures of Mookah Flour...and 57 Cranberry Bells.
10	Got it! Tora and Poppi will fetch!
11	Dromarch, could you perhaps go and get the other essentials?
12	Why, of course. I'll be back in a jiffy.
13	Everyone else... You're in charge of PR!
14	Roll up! Gorg's Just Desserts is officially open!
15	Come see! Possibly the first chance in history to taste the\nBlade-made desserts!
16	Forget the rest! Get the best!
qst200503_ms.json
1	Hey, you. You're a Driver, ain'tcha?
2	Me? Yeah...?
3	So you are! Ah, what a stroke of luck!
4	I was just looking for someone to\npick up a few bits 'n' bobs for me.
5	Bits and bobs...?
6	That's right. It was, oh, about a year\nago now. My ship ran aground, and\ndid I feel like a fool.
7	She was a good 'un, but I had to\nabandon her, along with all the\ncargo she was carrying.
8	What sort of cargo are we talking here?
9	...Paintings.
10	Oh?
11	That's what I was hoping you could\npick up: my very own works of art.
12	So you're an artist?
13	Not by trade, no.
14	But I dabble, and it is a passion\nof mine, I can't deny.
15	I'm not the best of artists, not by a\nlong shot, but I still poured my heart\nand soul into those paintings.
16	I'd almost given up on them, to tell\nyou the truth. But it's been a year now\nand I'm still dwelling on this...
17	Whadda you say? Could you help\nme out here?
18	I can see that the paintings are very\nimportant to you...
19	All right. We'll get them back for\nyou, I promise.
20	Really?! Oh, that's fantastic!
21	So where's this ship of yours that\nran aground?
22	Ah, hmm. About that...
23	Something wrong?
24	Well, it was my ship, but I wasn't\nexactly in command. I'd always left\nthe navigation down to the captain.
25	And when it ran aground, I wasn't\nactually on board...
26	So, I'm afraid I can't tell you its exact\nco-ordinates...
27	Oh, come on!
28	All right, it might take some looking\naround, then.
29	I imagine it will, yeah...\nI wonder where it got to.
30	Hmm. Were you acquainted with any\nof the crew?
31	Oh, of course! One of them's bound\nto know something, eh?
32	So could you tell us a bit about your\nold crew, Alban?
33	Righto. I count three in town right now.\nThey shouldn't be hard to track down.
34	Their names are Bennett, Gamri,\nand Rhidluk.
35	Thanks again, and good luck!
36	No problem. We'll take care of this,\nGorg's your uncle!
qst200504_ms.json
1	Bennett, Gamri and Rhidluk are\nall living here in Fonsa Myma.
2	It shouldn't take you long to find\nthem, I don't think.
3	I hope you'll like the shop!
4	The shop's in the Commercial District.\nYou should go and have a look for\nyourself.
qst200505_ms.json
1	You want to hear about Alban's\nbeached ship?
2	I was a navigation officer back then.\nI was just starting out, too.
3	It was my first ever voyage. I still recall\nhow the ship lurched from side to\nside...how my stomach was churning...
4	In fact, that's about the only thing\nI remember. I was on the verge of\npassing out...
5	Well anyway, we were heading out to\nthe Cloud Sea, of that I'm sure. I threw\nup the moment we reached land...
qst200506_ms.json
1	Alban's ship?\nThe one that ran aground?
2	Yeah, I was the helmsman.
3	That blasted Leftherian Archipelago...\nUgh, I'm getting flashbacks...
qst200507_ms.json
1	Oh, Alban's ship?
2	I was just the chef, so I can't tell you\nmuch about where we landed...
3	But I can tell you there was\nsome sort of village nearby.\nI know because I saw it.
qst200515_ms.json
1	Uhh...this has to be it, right...?\nThis piece of scrap...?
2	I don't think it could be anything else,\nto be honest.
3	Then let's get what we came for and\nleg it out of here!
4	Wait... There are Aligo nearby.
5	Looks like they've taken up nest\ninside the ship.
6	So we rush 'em down. What's the\nproblem?
7	Bravery and folly are two sides of\nthe same coin.
8	These Aligo seem tougher than most.\nIt wouldn't be wise to take them all\non at once.
9	So what are we going to do?
10	I've got a plan. But first, we'll need to\nprepare some ingredients.
11	Mind helping me gather them?
12	Sure, I'll help.\nWhat is it you're after, though?
13	We'll need a Beautiful Shoot, a\nfew Lemon Stones, and some\nHide 'n' Creepers.
14	They're all native to Leftheria, so they\nshouldn't be so hard to find.
15	When you've got the ingredients,\ncome hand them over to me, OK?\nOff you go, now!
qst200516_ms.json
1	Hey. We're back with your paintings!
2	Oh, no kidding! Thanks, you lot!\nYou're one in a million!
3	Yes, indeed, they all seem to be safe\nand accounted for!
4	...But now that I look at it, they're\npretty poor, aren't they? I'd be\nembarrassed to show these in public.
5	Nothing to be ashamed of,\nin my opinion.
6	There's a saying: "Passion is the road\nto betterment".
7	As long as you hold a passion for\npainting, there's no limit to what\nyou can achieve.
8	You think? Yeah...maybe you're right!
9	You've started getting my creative\njuices flowing again.
10	I'm busy enough with my restaurant\nchain as it is, but maybe I can set\naside some time to get back into it.
11	Mm? Did you just say\n"restaurant chain"?
12	I did. What about it?
13	Are you interested in the food?\nOr maybe the cooking?
14	Well...
15	As it happens, I'm sort of a...\nconfectioner-cum-pâtissier, you\ncould say. An enthusiast, at least.
16	I try not to give it much thought,\nthough, being a Blade and all.
17	Oh, come on! After everything you\njust said, now you tell me you're\ntrying to hide your own hobbies?
18	What happened to "Passion is the road\nto betterment"?
19	As long as you've got the passion,\nanything's possible, no?
20	Heh, too true. You've got me there.
21	Now, about your reward...\nHow about I lend out one of my shops\nto you? Tentatively, of course.
22	As it so happens, one of them's\nunoccupied at the moment.
23	You manage the shop itself and I'll\nhandle the upkeep. But I will have to\ntake a percentage of your earnings...
24	Well? Whadda ya say?
25	Wow. I have to say, it's an incredibly\ntempting offer, but I'm afraid I'd have\nto decline, because, well...
26	Now, slow down. Why don't you take\na look and see for yourself first?
27	If you like the look of the place,\nmy offer still stands.
28	But, I...
29	Come on, Gorg, we can at least go\nand see it, can't we?
30	If you still don't like it, you can always\nturn down his offer later on.
31	Well...if you insist. Let's see it then.
32	It's at the plaza near the Fonsa Myma\nGate. Take your time, look around.
qst200517_ms.json
1	Wow... This IS a swanky looking\nplace, isn't it? And in an excellent\nlocation, too.
2	You seem to be quite enamored\nwith it.
3	I can't deny it. I'd love to set up shop\nin a place like this.
4	Then I see no reason for you not to\naccept Alban's kind offer.
5	But what are you gonna put on sale?\nYou can't open shop without having\nsome kind of supplies, right?
6	Well, I've made all sorts of candy in\nmy free time.
7	I thought maybe I could rustle up a\nfew new recipes based on my past\nexperiments.
8	Nice. Sign me up as a taste tester!
9	But first, we'll need the raw ingredients.\nWe can't start without those.
10	I see. Then tell us where to find them.\nWe'll gather them for you.
11	That'd be a great help, thanks.
12	All right, so first up we're going to\nmake cookies. I've thought up three\nrecipes we could use for that.
13	Hot Cookies, Neon Cookies and\nBlood Cookies.
14	I want to start off with a selection\nof those three and offer them to\ncustomers as samples.
15	Gotcha. Come on, guys. Let's get\nmoving before I start drooling in\nanticipation!
qst200518_ms.json
1	There we go - it's finished!
2	If Poppi may say so, that looking\nvery cute!
3	Glad to hear it, Poppi.\nI hope the taste doesn't disappoint!
4	Poppi love this name, too.\nLovemerry Cake sound very sweet!
5	Kind of you to say! This here is my\nabsolute masterpiece!
6	Well! This ain't half bad!
7	And these products... I can see they're\nincredibly well made. This place'll be\nbustling before you know it!
8	You're welcome to open up shop\nas soon as you like!
9	Hmm, the thing is, I'm a traveler at\nheart. I was thinking we'd need to hire\nsome employees for while I'm away.
10	Don't you worry about that.\nI can manage the staff here on my end.
11	Oh, neat. Thank you!
12	But tell me... Why are you doing all\nthis for me?
13	Well, we both have dreams that we\nwant to realize. You helped me, so now\nI'm helping you. That's all there is to it.
14	I'm going to keep working on my\npainting skills too.
15	So you just keep making your\nsweets and that'll make us both\nhappy-campers!
16	I'm really grateful to you for all this.\nThanks again.
17	I'll show you the best I can be,\nwhether I'm fighting or baking.
18	Still early days for the latter though,\nwouldn't you say?
19	Haha! True enough!
20	It'll be getting busy soon. Get your\nfriends to help out, won't you?
21	Oh, I'm sure they won't mind!
qst200519_ms.json
1	I'm really proud of this recipe, if I do\nsay so myself. Cookies that change\nflavor with each one you try...
2	And the way they crumble in your\nmouth... Yeah, I'm liking this!
3	We can put this on the menu for sure!
4	Now, I think it's time we gave some\nthought to flans...
5	We can't just let the cookies steal all\nthe limelight, can we?
6	I've already thought of four recipes\nwe can use.
7	I just hope one of them will be good\nenough to sell as a staple here...
8	Hmm... It's not spicy, but somehow\nit makes you feel warm and tingly\non the inside.
9	I'm getting a hint of Indoline\ntea leaves...
10	Wait... This isn't just spicy...\nMy entire body is heating up!
11	Water... Water!!!
12	I don't think anyone will want a cookie\nthat'll make them run for water. We'll\nhave to start over.
13	It's pretty mild... Maybe slightly bitter...\nThese would definitely appeal more\nto the savory palate.
14	My one concern is the smell.\nIt's not the most pleasant...
15	I don't think we'll be able to put this\non the menu, no. We'll need to start\nover from scratch.
16	Ah! It's like...\nMy head seems to feel clearer with\neach bite!
17	These are incredibly appetizing!
18	Yeah, this will be perfect for the menu!\nCustomers are sure to come back for\nmore!
19	...Right. I think that's enough for the\nwarming up stage.
20	We've got decent recipes lined up for\nthe cookies and the flans, but now...
21	It's time to bring out the hallmark\nof any patisserie: the cake!
22	We're going to make the best cake\nAlrest has ever known and turn it\ninto our number one product!
23	Well, it has a very pleasant taste...
24	But it lacks that little something, that\noomph... I think we should try again.
25	Hmm...
26	It's the right consistency, all right,\nbut I don't think it's really got enough\nsweetness to it.
27	I thought we might be able to evoke\nthe warm fuzzy feeling of first love...
28	But it seems I don't have the skill\nfor it. No, we'll have to redo it.
29	As I'm eating this...I can't help but feel\nincredibly sad...
30	My heart aches... I can feel tears\nwelling up in my eyes...
31	There's nothing wrong with the taste,\nbut I don't think anyone will order a\ndessert that makes them depressed...
32	We'll just have to try something else\nthen.
33	Well, it's eye-catching, that's for sure.
34	But aside from that, it's not so special.\nIt tastes just like any other torte.
35	I think we'll have to start over.
36	Hmm. I tried making waffles\naccording to the alignment of the\nstars for good fortune, but, well...
37	I doubt we'll be ushering in any sort\nof luck with that taste...
38	We should probably try something\na little less quirky, maybe.
39	I know I was trying to create a very\nsugary creation with this one...
40	But I may have overdone it a tad.\nA single serving of this would put\nanyone off sugar for a week...
41	I don't think it's ready to go on sale\nyet. We'll have to do it over.

1	Looks like everyone really loves your\nsweets, Gorg. Me included!
2	When all the fighting's over and we\ncan finally settle down, I can't wait to\nsee you make a name for yourself!
3	Looks like everyone's gone gaga over\nyour sweets, Gorg. Me included!
4	When all this fighting nonsense is over,\nI hope we can all sit down and enjoy\nyour sweets in peace.
5	It seems everyone is quite besotted\nwith your sweets, Gorg. I myself am\nno exception.
6	When the war has ended and peace is\nrestored, I look forward to seeing your\nbusiness flourish.
7	I have to say, people have gone\nbonkers over your sweets, Gorg!\nThat goes for me as well!
8	Once we're finished with all this\nfighting malarkey, you should settle\ndown here. Do what you love most.
9	I'd never have gotten this opportunity\nif you hadn't awakened me from my\nCore Crystal, Rex...
10	I'd never have gotten this opportunity\nif you hadn't awakened me from my\nCore Crystal, Nia...
11	I'd never have gotten this opportunity\nif you hadn't awakened me from my\nCore Crystal, Mòrag...
12	I'd never have gotten this opportunity\nif you hadn't awakened me from my\nCore Crystal, Zeke...
13	I exist to serve you, to keep you safe.
14	So it never really crossed my mind to\nthink about what I'd do after I left the\nbattlefield.
15	But maybe someday...\nwhen this is all over...
16	I'll make candy for you, and we can all\nsit down together and have a blast!
17	I'll make candy for you, and we can all\nsit down together and have a blast!
18	I'll make candy for you, and we can all\nsit down together and have a blast!
19	I'll make candy for you, and we can all\nsit down together and have a blast!
20	What do you say? Will you let me\nsubject you to some sweet, sweet\ncelebration?
21	Definitely!
22	But of course!
23	I look forward to it.
24	Heck yeah!

1	...
2	Something up, Dagas?
3	...
4	...Dagas?
5	Do not address your King\nso lightly, serf.
6	I was merely indulging in a spot of...\ncontemplation.
7	Sorry... It's just, you seemed to be\na bit down in the dumps...
8	Well. I suppose I should reward you for\ndisplaying devotion to your monarch.
9	As such, I will overlook your\ndemeaning attitude this once.
10	As you know, I was once the\nruler of a nation.
11	Where is my kingdom now? Whither\nmy people? What has become of them?
12	These questions plague me\nmost every day.
13	Yet tragic though it be, I possess\nno memories of that time.
14	As such, I have no way of knowing\nmy one-time kingdom's fate.
15	And look at me now. Reduced to\nserving beneath a mere Driver.
16	What cruel twist of fate has turned\nmonarch into servant?
17	Dunno if we can help you with that one.
18	Yeah...it's just how Blades\nand Drivers work.
19	...
20	You may not have any memories,\nbut perhaps there could be records\nleft of this nation of yours?
21	Aha! Dear Mòrag, you may have hit\nupon an excellent point.
22	Though I remember it not, it was a\nkingdom fitting for my personage.
23	Surely such a great land cannot have\nbeen forgotten from history entirely.
24	My retainers! Your new task is to obtain\nrecords of my past great deeds!
25	Do records like that even exist...?
26	If we are going to find them, I guess\nit'll be in history books or ancient texts.
27	Precisely, my dear Zeke!\nYou are a loyal retainer indeed.
28	Now, our goal is set!
29	Let us visit bookshops throughout\nthe land, seek ancient records, and\nuncover the truth of my lost kingdom!
30	The quest is afoot!
qst200602_ms.json
1	Arrogant Behemoth?
2	You mean the big monster thing\nI saw that one time?
3	Looked like a pretty nasty\npiece of work, that one did.
4	Actually, it was so out there that\nnobody believes me when I tell 'em.
5	It was early morning when I saw it.\n5 o'clock or thereabouts.
6	Over on the hill near Triedge Isle,\nthere was this crazy huge shadowy\nthing moving about.
7	Honestly, I thought I was seeing things\ntoo at first. Some kind of bad dream.
8	I've never heard of any monster\nreaching that kind of size.
9	At any rate, if you're gonna check\nit out, you should be careful.
10	I don't know if even a Titan battleship\nwould be able to down that behemoth!
qst200603_ms.json
1	So, is this really the place?
2	Well... From what the soldiers said,\nit should be around here somewhere...
3	You really think a great demon's gonna\nshow up in this deserted place?
4	Don't act like this is my fault!\nHow am I meant to know?
5	If there've been sightings, that means there\nhas to be SOMETHING here, right?
6	?!
7	Something appear!
8	Is that...the demon?
9	It's huge...
10	Even for a demon, isn't that\na bit too massive?
11	It incredible!
12	Dagas!
13	Hold on!
14	So, you are the foul demon?
15	You are insolent indeed\nto look down on my personage.
16	But no matter.
17	Not all can be as versed in proper conduct as I.\nI will grant you an audience.
18	Hold on - what are you, stupid?\nYou're just gonna go face that thing?
19	Seriously - you'll be crushed to pieces!
20	Do you hear my voice, demon?!
21	I am king of a land named Regideria!
22	I know you are the beast that\ncaused my kingdom's downfall.
23	As King, I must avenge my people\nwhom you wronged long ago!
24	If you are truly as terrible as the legends say...
25	Then show me the extent of your strength!\nShow me the power that felled a kingdom!
26	Quit provoking that thing already, Dagas!
27	Actually, does that creature even\nunderstand human speech?
28	Why so shy, demon?\nDo you not wish to do battle?
29	Hmm... Then let's see how you like this!
30	Meh-meh! What Dagas doing?!
31	Ahahahaha... So, demon.\nAt last you recognize your foe.
32	"At last you recognize your foe"?!\nYou moron, Dagas!
33	Now you've gone and really made it mad!
34	Why would you provoke it?
35	You ask strange questions, girl.
36	For what purpose did we come here\nif not to fell this foul beast?
37	That's no reason to get it all worked up!\nHaven't you heard of careful strategy?!
38	Dear me...
39	Can you truly be so afraid of a mere animal?\nAnd you call yourselves my retainers!
40	That's not the issue here, moron!
41	We've landed ourselves in a right pickle.\nWhat do we do now, Rex?
42	What now?
43	Best to retreat...
44	Then we find Ardainian Titan warship\nto help us take demon down!
45	Hopeless, every one of you.
46	Wait here awhile, retainers.\nI will slay the demon myself.
47	You, hold my sword.
48	You'll die, you know.
49	I will not. Nay, I cannot.\nFor the people of Regideria, I must prevail.
50	OK then. I'm convinced. Let's do this.
51	You're really sure about this, Rex?
52	All right, then...\nI guess there's no point arguing with you.
53	Let's go slay that moron's demon.
qst200604_ms.json
1	Demon or no, 'twas a mere beast.\nIt could not hope to rival a king.
2	We beat it...
3	Yeah. We actually beat it.
4	I gotta say, I didn't think we'd\nactually do it.
5	Honestly...\nHave you no pride?!
6	How could we fail to overcome\nsuch a trifling foe?
7	Frankly, you should be ashamed\nthat you did not slay it more swiftly.
8	Uh, right...
9	I gotta say, though... You're pretty\nawesome when you go all out, Dagas.
10	Indeed. I knew you were hiding your full strength,\nbut this was more than I had bargained for.
11	I'm glad we met you as an\nally, not an enemy.
12	Are you still thinking about your lost kingdom?
13	It is as you see.
14	For one so great as I, to slay\nsuch a foe is a simple task.
15	And yet... Though the beast lies\ndefeated, the kingdom remains lost.
16	There is no way for us to be certain\nit was even the land I once ruled.
17	Dagas...
18	Hey, don't be such a downer.
19	No point worrying about what's dead and gone.\nIf you want a kingdom, you should make a new one!
20	Yeah, Zeke's right.
21	If you try your hardest,\nanything's possible!
22	Interesting...\nThere is a certain wisdom in your counsel.
23	Now that my nemesis lies slain...
24	It is not fitting for a king to\ndwell forever on the past.
25	My path of conquest is far from over!
26	I am the man who will someday rule\nthis entire world!
27	Hahahahahah! Hahahahahah!\nHahahahahah!
28	Well, he certainly seems motivated now...
29	Dagas have energy, but still\nnot quite in touch with reality.
30	Hear this. You have yet to prove your might as retainers.\nTherefore, I will lend you my royal strength.
31	However, 'tis only for the sake of my righteous victory!
32	Never forget this, my subjects!
33	Hahahahahah! Hahahahahah!\nHahahahahah!
34	It's great that he's getting\ninto this, and all...
35	But his attitude still bugs me.
36	Don't be too harsh.
37	For all his words, I do believe he\ncares for us. Let's be happy for him.
38	Sounds about right.
39	Being able to deal even with total nutters like him\nis the mark of a real Driver!
40	If you say so...
41	Haha... Hahahahahah!\nHahahahahahahahah!
qst200605_ms.json
1	What ails you, my Driver?\nYou look befuddled as a loon.
2	Is something troubling you?
3	No... I'm just happy that you seem\nto have got your motivation back.
4	It's nothing. I'm just pleased that\nyou're looking motivated now!
5	No...there is no trouble. I am just\nhappy that you seem motivated now.
6	No problems here. I'm just happy that\nyou're looking good and motivated!
7	Well, if my attitude pleases you, I trust\nyou will work hard to serve my aims.
8	To protect a true and loyal retainer,\nI would gladly draw out the depths\nof my strength.
9	The depths of your strength, huh...\nSounds pretty unbeatable.
10	The depths of your strength, eh?\nGuess we'll be pretty unbeatable.
11	The depths of your strength? I could\nnot ask for a more dependable ally.
12	The depths of your strength?\nDamn, those are pretty deep.
13	Hahaha! Your king will not be\neasily defeated!
14	For the sake of restoring my kingdom,\nI will spare no effort!
15	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Hahahahahah!

20	We see something special here today!\nA whole new way of eat!
21	Chompy-chompy was soooo amazing!
22	Heart is all a-fluttery!
23	Heeeeeey, what's the big idea?\nI'm not even a little bit full!
24	No no, if friend eat more then business is bye-bye!
25	This your grand prize!\nDon't eat it all at once!
26	Are these mushrooms really all for me?
27	Wow! Thank you!\nI'll make sure to get them home safely!
qst200702_ms.json
1	But for real, that truly incredible\nchompy-chomp!
2	Friend Boreas become speed-eating\nsensation in Nopon society today!
3	Spectators also much enjoy, so\ncontest was great success!
4	No doubt next time success is\neven greater, meh!
5	Thank friend for participating!
qst200703_ms.json
1	Oh ho ho!\nMushrooms all for me!
2	He looks so happy.
3	He must really like mushrooms.
4	Stop mushroom talk... Tora not want to see another mushroom\nas long as Tora live... *burp* 'Scuse me...
5	Huh?
6	What in Elysium's name are you doing, Boreas?
7	Looking for something?
8	Huh?
9	What is this?
10	What did you find? ...Boreas?
11	What's that card?
12	Uhhh...
13	"Thanks for the food!"\nFrom...Yumyum the Burglar?
14	Huh... Is this...\nIs this a message from the thief?
15	Whuh?!
16	Looks like he snuck in while we were away and\nnicked all of our food.
17	No no no no no!
18	Calm down, Boreas!
19	This is unacceptable. Unacceptable!
20	Meh meh?!
21	Meeeeh-eh?!
22	You disappeared for a second there, Boreas.
23	...Did you...uh...go somewhere and come back just now?
24	I didn't go anywhere!
25	What's that, then?
26	This? This undelicious-looking piece of...of nothing?
27	You were carrying that when you came in.\nYou don't know where you got it from?
28	I was so angry that I lost track of everything!\nI have no idea where this came from!
29	Analysis indicate that carving is not\nfrom Argentum.
30	So Boreas traveled to another country in that split second?
31	I knew the blighter was fast, but I didn't think he was THAT fast.
32	We should try to return that carving before\nits owner notices it's gone.
33	He's right.\nBut looking for the owner sounds like a right hassle.
34	Perhaps by studying the statue, we'll be able\nto discern its origin.
qst200704_ms.json
1	Oh bother... Bother, bother...\nWhere'd it get off to...?
2	Um...\nIs it this statue you're looking for?
3	Th-the statue!
4	Incredible! You found it!\nThank you so much!
5	What happened?
6	I can't say I understand, myself...\nCould you explain?
7	Ah, beg your pardon.\nI got so happy I forgot myself...
8	A few days ago, I got a calling card\nfrom Yumyum the Burglar, saying he'd\nsteal my statue.
9	But before Yumyum could steal it,\nthe statue just disappeared from\nbefore my very eyes...
10	It was just too much for my poor brain;\nI had no idea WHAT was going on.
11	I'd been working on that piece for\nnearly 20 years now, and it's still\na work in progress.
12	If I can't finish my work before I die,\nI bet I'll become some sort of\nvengeful phantom, I'm sure of it!
13	Oh, but you took it somewhere safe\nfor me, didn't you?
14	Thanks to you, it remained safe from\nthe clutches of Yumyum... Architect\nbe praised...
15	I cannot thank you enough, friends!\nI am in your debt!
16	I, uh, I see...\nAll's well that ends well, hahaha...
17	By the way, do you know who this\nYumyum is?
18	He stole my precious food!\nHe's a big meanie is what he is!
19	Oh, Yumyum the Burglar is quite\ninfamous round these parts!
20	Children in particular revel in stories\nof the Nopon rogue.
21	They say he's a gentleman thief,\nstealing treasures from villains\nand giving them to poor Nopon...
22	Although apparently he does also steal\nfrom regular people sometimes.\nThat seems like a character flaw...
23	Not so!
24	Sculptor! Did you not, just last week,\ndrink your daughter's Odifa without her\npermission?! 'Tis deserved retribution!
25	I-it was just a sip!
26	'Tis a wrong in need of righting!
27	But the plan hit a snag! Who would\nhave thought the statue would be\nsnatched before I could snatch it...
28	And who was it that crossed Yumyum?\nIt was you! Boreas!
29	How long will you continue to humiliate\nYumyum the Burglar?!
30	So you're the one who stole my\nprecious foodstuffs?!
31	Ohohohoho... You finally worked it out,\nyou blockhead?
32	Took you long enough...
33	The one who ransacked your food\nstash...was none other than me,\nYumyum the Burglar!
34	Why would you do such a thing?!
35	Why? Why, you shouldn't need to ask,\nBoreas! You of all people should know!
36	Look into your heart, you know that\nof which I speak...
37	Errrm...\nWhy did you steal my food?
38	Hmm...
39	I haven't got a clue!
40	You overstuffed balloony dunce!
41	By winning the eating contest in the\nRumbletum Canteen, you have stolen\nthe Nopon's innocent hearts! Obviously!
42	The cute little Nopon hearts...\nTheir tender little Nopon hearts...
43	Those pure Nopon hearts that I,\nYumyum the Burglar, have been\nunable to steal...
44	You stole and defiled their hearts!\nA thousand deaths would not be\nsufficient punishment for you!
45	Oh ho ho ho...
46	Hnghghgh... I see, I see...\nYou wish to stoke the rage of Yumyum!
47	You wish to claim that you are\na better burglar than Yumyum\nthe, nota bene, Burglar!
48	Very well, as you wish! We shall see\nwhich of us is the superior burglar!
49	That's kinda sudden...
50	A very simple burgle-off, then!
51	Obtain a Shimmering Feather from\nthe Ansel Hatchery in the Leftherian\nArchipelago...
52	And then return to Rumbletum Canteen\nbefore your opponent to win!
53	If you can somehow prevail over\nYumyum the Burglar, I will return your\nfood stash to you untouched!
54	Boreas will win this contest!\nNothing will stand between me and\nmy larder!
55	H-hey now, hold up, Boreas!\nYou're not going alone?!
56	H-hey now, hold up!\nI haven't given the start signal yet!
57	That's a false start! That's cheating!\nCome back here, I demand a redo...!
qst200706_ms.json
1	D-darn it... Monsters are standing in\nthe way of the treasure...
2	I gotta think of something, otherwise\nBoreas'll beat me again...!
qst200707_ms.json
1	What friend doing?
2	Y-you!\nWhen did you-?!
3	Ah, Tora get it. For sure, this area full\nof monsters, so if friend have no Blade\nto help, get feathers is challenge.
4	N-not at all! No challenge!\nI already have a brilliant stratagem!
5	You may play with the monsters\nif you wish!
6	Huh... Boreas, with how fast you are,\nI bet you could fetch the feather\nwithout the monsters noticing you.
7	Huh?
8	Should Boreas fetch the feather?
9	Yes
10	No
11	I'll be there and back in no time!
12	N-no way!\nAt this speed, I'll be found for sure!
13	Nah, I'd feel bad sending Boreas alone.\nLet's all go ahead together!
14	Right, let's wade through monsters\nagain... Joy of joys.
qst200708_ms.json
1	Blast you, Boreas!
2	You've bested me once, but\ndon't get cocky just yet!
3	The burgle-off is far from over!
4	Nobody said anything about\nmultiple rounds...
5	The next item to steal is... Ready?\nThe Emperor Niall's unmentionables!
6	Uh, what?!\nYou want us to steal underwear?
7	And Emperor Niall's, no less?
8	Theft like that do nobody any good...
9	Do not think of it as a simple garment!
10	Though at first glance the task\nmay seem frivolous...
11	If you were to get caught, you'd be\nfacing a lifetime in prison...or even\ndeath! The stakes are high, friends!
12	Are you prepared to accept this\njeopardous challenge?!
13	Mmm, I love jeopardous.\nJeopardous is my favorite flavor!
14	Spoken like a true burglar!
15	Tora not sure Boreas mean it that way.
16	Well, well, well!\nRound two of the burgle-off begins!
17	After thieving Emperor Niall's\nunderpants, we meet in Nharil\nCentral Plaza!
18	...Are you OK with this, Mòrag?
19	Hm...
qst200709_ms.json
1	Access beyond this point is restricted\nto authorized personnel. I'm sorry, but\nI'm going to have to ask you to leave.
2	Could we make some sort of deal?\nSay, through the medium of a\n3,000G bribe?
3	You see, I simply have to get\ninside His Majesty's chambers!
4	That's... Wow. You know trying to bribe\nan Imperial official is a crime, right?\nAnd so openly, as well...
5	Get lost, bub!
6	Or would you rather get a one-way\nguided tour of the castle dungeons?!
7	Yikes! That didn't work!
qst200710_ms.json
1	You lot?!\nWhy in darnation are you here?!
2	You're the one who told us to get\nthe Emperor's underpants, remember?
3	What is Yumyum doing here?
4	Yumyum is trying to sneak inside, duh!
5	You lot can just stay here and talk\nthe guards' ears off.
6	...Hm, yeah, those guards don't look\nlike they'd be easily convinced.
7	Could Boreas get goods without\nbeing spotted?
8	Should Boreas fetch the underwear?
9	Yes
10	No
11	I'll get it done, lickety-split!
12	It's more difficult than I thought...\nAt this speed, the guards'll see me!
13	Well, whatever. Even if Boreas can't\ndo it, as long as we've got Mòrag, we\nshould be able to just walk in, right?
14	I guess so?
15	...I can get us in, but I'll admit\nI'm not overly eager.
16	To begin with, a sister stealing her little\nbrother's underwear...? It's just weird.
17	Now, now. Don't be like that.\nWe're doing it for Boreas, right?
18	...If you say so.\nI can't believe I'm doing this...
qst200711_ms.json
1	I... I can't believe it.\nThe great Yumyum, beaten twice...
2	Right, so twice we beat you.\nIsn't it time to call it quits?
3	Not even slightly...!
4	Like every good contest, this one too\nrequires three rounds, with the final\none being the deciding one!
5	We've already won two for three,\nthough? You can't hope to catch up.
6	The final round decides who wins\nand loses, I say! What came before\nwas just the warm-up!
7	He's making stuff up as he goes along...
8	I'm fed up already! That jeopardous\nof yours from last time wasn't even\ntasty...
9	How dare you...\nBut I think you'll like what I have in\nstore for the grand finale!
10	For the last battle is something\ntruly special! Namely...
11	A mushroom!
12	A mushroom?! Nom!
13	Yes, a mushroom!
14	A phantom fungus, from a mushroom\nbarque that sunk a century ago...\nThe Bloomshroom!
15	They now lie in the Bastion of Varrac\nin Temperantia, jealously guarded as\na holy relic by Ignas... Or so I hear.
16	That is what I challenge you to steal!
17	A hundred-year old mushroom...?\nSounds delicious!
18	After hundred years, any fungus\nbecome ghost of fungus...
19	You don't get it, Tora! It's that little\nbit of rot that brings out the flavor!
20	I accept your challenge!
21	In this last act, Yumyum will rise to the\noccasion! And in doing so, steal back\nfrom Boreas the Nopon's little hearts!
22	We gotta hurry!
23	Can't miss the chance to eat\na lovely lovely Bloomshroom!
qst200712_ms.json
1	No, let go of me!\nContrary to the name, Yumyum is not\nactually at all yummy!
2	Attacked by Ignas?\nIs par for course, meh.
3	He's kind of a friend by now, isn't he?\nWe should probably help!
4	But what about the mushroom?!
5	Let's save Yumyum, then we'll talk\nmushroom!
6	It might actually taste better\nafter some light exercise!
7	If you say so...
qst200713_ms.json
1	Th-thanks, you saved me.\nI'm so happy to be alive...
2	Honestly...\nIf we hadn't come around, you'd\nhave been Igna kibble by now.
3	And I'm grateful that you did!\nThank you again.
4	But however though!\nThe game is still afoot!
5	You think just because you saved\nYumyum's life, he'll roll over and\nlet you win? As if!
6	You wanna keep going?\nI thought you'd have learned by now...
7	Unquestionably!
8	...Having said that, there's a lot of\nfrisky Ignas around here. That's tough.
9	Perhaps if I could propose a truce,\nwe could cooperate for the time being,\nfor the safety and wellbeing of all?
10	Because you're scared,\nis what I'm getting.
11	N-n-n-n-no! Not me! Never!
12	...Whatever you say, skipper.
13	It's not me who's got fur in the game,\nso how 'bout we let Boreas decide.
14	Oh oho ho...
15	Tora not sure Boreas listening. Again...
16	Ha?!
17	What was that?
18	The fungal smell is getting stronger.\nThe Bloomshroom must be close!
19	You heard him.\nKeep up, or we're leaving you behind.
20	Y-y-yes ma'am!
qst200715_ms.json
1	Ugh, it's no use...\nThere's a lock on this thing...
2	And it's quite an intricate one.
3	I don't think we'll be able to open it.
4	Does that mean I can't eat\nthe Bloomshroom?!
5	Leave it to Yumyum!
6	You think you can do it?
7	Hehehehe...
8	Yumyum is a first-rate burglar...\nThe lock has not yet been built\nwhich would thwart me!
9	Show me that.
10	Hmhmhm, I see, I see...
11	Can you open it?
12	Patience, patience...
13	When you think about it, doesn't this\nlook more and more like a group effort?\nDivision of labor, so to speak!
14	Boreas cleared the path, and now\nYumyum the Burglar opens the lock...
15	It is because we joined forces that we\nwere able to attain this great treasure!
16	Two great heroes, beloved of Nopon\nand children, working arm in arm...\nWhat a glorious development!
17	Yeah, yeah. When do we eat\nthe Bloomshroom, though?
18	...Bah.\nListening clearly isn't his strong suit...
19	You only just realized?\nYou two've been talking across each\nother since this whole thing started...
20	I know, I know, but...\nGrrr, it just irks me that my greatest\nrival has to be such a thick oaf.
21	After we grab the Bloomshroom,\nwe gotta hurry back to the Rumbletum\nCanteen!
22	There they'll know how best to\ncook it up!
23	He really doesn't listen, does he...?
24	Yumyum, hurry up and open it already!
25	Nearly there...
26	And voilà! The lock is open!\nGo on, take a gander inside!
qst200716_ms.json
1	Meh meh! This is incredible mushroom!\nWhere friends get it?
2	Is dried-up mushroom really that incredible?
3	This is Bloomshroom!\nMake it splishy-sploshy and it get real big!
4	They go extinct more than century ago.\nEverybody say they gone for good.
5	Rumtumtum never thought he see real Bloomshroom\nwith his own eyes! It dream come true!
6	So how big is that?
7	Meh meh! What is easiest way to put this...?\nInfinitely big!
8	You mean...an all-you-can-eat mushroom?\nYou gotta cook it up right away!
9	And we have to treat everyone!\nIT'S A MUSHROOM PARTYYY!
10	Heheh!\nRumtumtum will get cooking!
11	Boreas so cool!
12	Boreas so dreamy!
13	Boreas!\nWe will call this burgle-off a draw!
14	It feels good to sit and eat surrounded\nby Nopon friends.
15	Naturally, Yumyum will graciously return\nall stolen foods.
16	So next time, we can decide fairly\nwho the greatest burglar is!
17	And we will finally see who is number one\nin Nopon hearts and minds!
18	Hey, you... You listening?!
19	Don't you ever stop talking?\nIt's time to eat, not time to talk!
20	Mehmehmehhhhh!
qst200717_ms.json
1	Ahh, that mushroom we all ate\nwas the literal best!
2	You'd know, Boreas, you ate\nfor three as always!
3	Hopefully that means you're full?
4	It musta been, since you ate\nthree people's worth!
5	I hope that was enough for you?
6	You certainly ate with what can only\nbe termed a healthy appetite.
7	Do you feel sated now?
8	Boreas, buddy, you sure like eating.\nIt was a marvel, watching you nosh!
9	Was there enough for you?
10	Mmm...\nI'm sure I could eat more!
11	After all, there's still plenty of things\nin the world that I haven't tried yet!
12	I wanna find and eat them all!
13	And also...\nThe Nopon seem to look up to me, so I\nwanna stay the speed-eating champion!
14	I'll rise to any challenge!\nTora's, Yumyum's, or whatever you\nput before me, dear Driver.
15	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Ohohoho...\nThose speed eating contests sure are\na cheap way to fill a tummy!
qst200718_ms.json
1	Round one of first Mushroom\nSpeedy-Eaty contest begin soon!\nChallengers welcome!
2	Ooh, I wanted to join this!\nYou get a lot of mushrooms to eat!
3	Oho!\nFriend show enthusiasm!
4	But it would be no contest with\nonly one contestant...
5	N-no! How awful!\nSo I can't eat a lot of mushrooms?!
6	OK, in that case, Tora pick up gauntlet.\nNow can have contest, yes?
7	Wonderful! Then long-awaited first\nround of Mushroom Speedy-Eaty\ncontest begin imminently!
8	Tora! Thank you, friend!
9	Tora should warn Boreas,\nTora not go easy!
10	I'll do my best too, count on it!
qst200801_ms.json
1	Hey, everyone!\nLook at that Saffronia tree!\nIsn't it gorgeous?
2	Well, I think so, at least...
3	Oi, you there!
4	You need something from us?
5	Yeah, that girl specifically.
6	Me?
7	Give back the classified documents!
8	The what? Me? Huh?\nI don't understand...
9	Stop playing dumb!
10	We know you have them!\nOur intel is ironclad!
11	You can very well say that,\nbut I still have no idea what you mean...
12	Floren, are you sure you don't know\nanything?
13	Absolutely.\nI've got no clue.
14	Well, that's that then.\nMaybe you're just confused?
15	Hah!\nIf that's how you wanna play this...
16	I'm gonna make you return them!
17	Oh dear, I hate it when people\nget savage...
18	Shut your mouth!\nYou've brought it on yourselves!
19	You can't talk your way outta this!
qst200802_ms.json
1	What the hell? They ain't nothin' but\na bunch of women and children, and\nthey still kicked our butts...
2	I'll remember you, ya stinkin' brats!\nDon't think for a minute you'll get\naway with this!
3	Yaaawn.\nTalk about sour grapes...
4	Um, Floren. Are you sure you don't\nknow what those mercs wanted?
5	Yes, positive.\nI have no idea whatsoever.
6	But Floren often receive gifts from\npeople, could maybe be one of those?
7	Huh?\nSure, but I'd remember getting\ntop-secret information I think...
8	Ah?!
9	Floren suddenly remember?!
10	Let me through!
11	...No way!\nThe Saffronia...!
qst200803_ms.json
1	Floren? Is something up with that tree?
2	This one...She's hurt.
3	Hurt?
4	Yeah. She got injured when we were\nfighting those guys back there.
5	Yeah, but...it's a tree. They patch\nthemselves up, don't they?
6	They're living creatures, Nia!
7	If we just leave her like this, she might\nwither and die.
8	You can't joke about that!
9	Uh, ah, sorry...
10	I didn't mean to, er, insult the tree...
11	But...\nEven if tree hurt, what can we do about it?
12	Can we heal it?
13	I...don't know.\nI'll have to do some research...
14	Maybe if we find the right kind of medicine...
15	Medicine?
16	If it exists, I'm sure the rest of us can\nhelp track it down.
17	Then it's decided.\nLet's heal the tree!
18	Really? You'll help me?
19	I guess there are some people that'd be pretty cut up if this\ntree died.
20	Community service, of a sort!
21	You don't mind us pitching in, do you?
22	Not at all!\nThank you everyone!
23	Right, let's see what we can learn about her.
qst200804_ms.json
1	Yes...\nI understand now.
2	To heal her, we're going to need\nfungicide and antidesiccant.
3	We could also use a tree brace\nto keep her steady while she's healing.
4	So all we need to heal the tree\nis those three things?
5	Yep!
6	Then what are we waiting for?
7	Where exactly are we going to find all that stuff, though?
8	Cedwyn! Lives in Torigoth in Gormott.\nKnows much about treeplants.
9	Good thinking, Tora!\nI'm sure he can help.
10	Meh he he!
11	Right, let's go talk to Cedwyn!
12	Yeah!
13	We'll come back as quickly as we can.\nPlease hold on a little longer.
qst200805_ms.json
1	Please wait for us.\nWe'll get you better in no time...
2	We'll need fungicide and antidesiccant\nto heal her wounds...
3	Oh, and we'll also need a tree brace,\nfor support.
4	Let's go to Torigoth, in Gormott,\nand talk to Cedwyn!
qst200806_ms.json
1	Oh, hello.\nNeed something?
2	Ah, well, I'm sorry.\nI don't think I'll be able to help.
3	My research has just started producing\nsome really exciting results, so I can't\nreally tear myself away.
4	I think I should have some free time\nin two months or so...
5	Mind if I ask you to wait till then?
qst200807_ms.json
1	You've gathered the necessary\ningredients?
2	For fungicide, I'll need...
3	Five Olsteprinium flowers, and\nfive Frozen Sapphires.
4	For the antidesiccant, let's see...
5	Three Amber Leaves, and\nten Ghost Dudleya plants.
6	I can make any amount of the medicine\nif you just get me those ingredients.
qst200808_ms.json
1	What's the matter? You need anything?
2	We're looking for a tree brace...\nDo you have one we could use?
3	A tree brace?\nWhy on Alrest would you need one?
4	Uhh, well, the truth is...
5	Oh, I see.
6	Well, for a Saffronia tree, you'll need\nan exceedingly sturdy one for sure.
7	Friend can make one here?
8	Ah, well, yes, I could.
9	But a brace for a big tree like that'd\nneed some special ingredients and\nprocessing.
10	Let's see now...
11	I should be able to make do with\nfive pieces of Healing Teak, found\nall across Gormott.
12	Thank you!\nWe'll get on that straight away!
13	Well, let's da-
14	Huh?\nWhere's Floren?
15	Floren over there.\nStare at processing process.
16	What in the world...?
qst200809_ms.json
1	Hmm...
2	What is the matter, miss?
3	Why do you gaze upon our work\nwith such sadness?
4	...Why don't people treat nature\nwith more respect?
5	We are all part of nature.\nYou must know this?
6	...Ah, I see. You love trees,\ndon't you, miss?
7	Yes!\nTrees, and wildflowers...\nAll plants are my friends.
8	Friends, you say...\nSuch a kind child you are, miss.
9	In any case, I'd like to assure you,\nwe do not treat nature roughly here.
10	Huh?\n...But...
11	It is true, we do make our livelihood\nhumbly taking the lives of trees and\nother plants.
12	Mankind wouldn't really be able to\nflourish otherwise...
13	But that's exactly why we are more\nthankful to the trees than anyone,\nand treat them with respect.
14	We in this lumberyard try not to waste\neven the smallest bits of wood, going\nto great lengths to find uses for them.
15	...Wow, OK.
16	I bet you'll make us the best tree brace\nthe world's ever seen!
17	Oh, is that what you needed?
18	Yeah! We need it to save a friend.
19	Is that so? Well then,\nI'll make sure myself it's a great one!
20	Really?
21	Of course!\nBut before I can do that, you'll\nhave to bring me some Healing Teak.
22	All right!
qst200810_ms.json
1	Oh, it looks like you got us the\nHealing Teak!
2	We'll get started straight away.\nJust wait there, OK?
3	OK!
4	Right, it's done!\nIt should be able to brace any tree,\nno matter how big!
5	Awesome!\n...It looks so powerful...
6	Tree brace really look powerful?
7	Yeah! It's a manufactured thing,\nbut it still looks like it's breathing,\ngrowing...
8	You've got a good eye, miss.\nYou can be sure we wouldn't just\nwant to kill a tree or plant!
9	We just shape it so it can live\nalongside us.
10	Ah, but here we are still chatting,\nwhile the Saffronia waits for your help!
11	Right!\nThanks again!
qst200811_ms.json
1	Sorry to keep you waiting. We'll make you\nall better.
2	How's it going?\nIs it working?
3	Yes, it's OK. She should be back to her\nold self in no time.
4	That's great.\nI guess our work here is done.
5	Nice one, Floren.
6	Thank you! And I'm sure the tree would\nthank you as well if she could!
7	Hmm...
8	Even though it's just a tree, I hope\nit knows that everything is OK now.
9	Of course she does!\nShe's just as aware as we are.
10	What a world, eh?\nYou learn something every day.
11	Thank you, Floren.
12	You're welcome!
qst200812_ms.json
1	Phew... You're sure going to some\ntrouble to heal some useless tree...
2	I guess this lousy Saffronia is\na pretty big deal or somethin', eh?
3	You guys...
4	Are you here to harass Floren again?
5	You got it, kid.\nI double-checked, and there's no way\nthe girl's not hidin' something.
6	I told you I don't have them!
7	Heh.\nObviously you wouldn't say you have\nthem if you're tryin' to hide things.
8	So what, I should tell you I have them?
9	A-ha! So you do have them!
10	Oh for crying out loud!\nI don't know what to tell you anymore!
11	I think in the end it'll come down to\nanother fight...
12	Seems so, kid. Seems so...
13	But this time we brought more friends,\nas well as a battle plan...
14	This time you won't get away!\nYou'll tell us everythin'!
qst200813_ms.json
1	Ah!\nLook, over there!
2	Another tree burning...!
3	Hurry!\nWe have to help her!
qst200814_ms.json
1	It's all OK now.
2	Excellent.\nLooks like we were just in time.
3	I wonder if the other trees are OK.
qst200815_ms.json
1	It's all OK now.
2	A timely intervention...
3	Let's see if the other trees are OK.
qst200816_ms.json
1	Nothing to worry about now.
2	Phew! We only just made it.
3	I'm not sure about the other trees.\nI wonder if they're OK.
qst200817_ms.json
1	Get outta the way!\nOr I'll make you regret it!
2	Puttin' out fires we went and set?\nI'll show you!
3	No more!\nYou won't burn any more trees!
4	Shut your filthy gob!\nThis has nothin' to do with you!
5	Move, or I'll make you move!
6	The Saffronia trees are important\nfor the people of Fonsa Myma!
7	We won't let you hurt\nthe trees anymore!
8	Stop your yammerin'!\nSomeone get them outta my face!
9	We're Urayans, born and bred!\nWe've all had combat training!
10	If you punks think you can go\nthrough us, just you ruddy try!
11	Everyone's...\nguarding the trees...?
12	I never knew so many people\ncared about the outdoors...
13	Floren!\nLet's hurry to help!
14	Sure!\nI'll join this struggle gladly!
qst200818_ms.json
1	Hey, miss! Thanks for guardin' the Grandarbor\nand everyone!
2	I can't take all the credit.\nEveryone else pitched in too!
3	I wouldn't have been able to save the\ntree without my friends helping out.
4	Some people may not care about the environment,\nbut there are loads of people who do.
5	I'm in the second camp!\nThis tree means a lot to me.
6	Me too! It's the most cherished thing we have here.
7	That's wonderful.\nPlease don't change that way of thinking!
8	We promise not to, miss!
9	Um, just so you know, I'm not a miss.\nI'm a mister.
10	Whaaat?
11	Huh?
12	You mean...you didn't know?
13	You...you must have known, right?
qst200819_ms.json
1	Hey, Cedwyn, you need to\ntake it easy sometimes!
2	That's easy to say, but...\nThis research is...so important...
3	Well, can you put it down for a minute?\nI wanted to tell you something.
4	...Well, all right.\nI suppose a minute won't hurt.
5	OK then, well, I'll try to make it quick!\nHere's the thing...
6	Right, so you're trying to save the\nSaffronia tree?
7	I can't help you with the tree brace,\nsadly. But fungicide and antidesiccant\nare definitely my territory.
8	Great!\nI knew we could count on you, Cedwyn!
9	Well, don't count your chickens, child.
10	I want to help you, really I do, but\nI'm currently out of some essential\nreagents...
11	Huh?\nOh, you don't have what you need...?
12	Please, don't be so crestfallen, Floren.
13	I can make as much medicine\nas you need if you bring me the\ningredients!
14	How does that sound?
15	...OK, that sounds like a deal.\nThank you, Cedwyn!
16	Anytime, Floren! Anytime.
17	Right, so what is it that you need?
18	First, for the fungicide...
19	Five Olsteprinium flowers\nand five Frozen Sapphires.
20	And for the antidesiccant...
21	Three Amber Leaves\nand ten Ghost Dudleya plants.
22	Got it, thanks!\nWe'll get you what you need!
23	Just be careful out there!
24	Cedwyn is a good man, pure\nand simple!
25	OK, let's go get those ingredients!
qst200825_ms.json
1	Hi Cedwyn, we brought the ingredients!
2	Oho!\nGreat job, Floren.
3	I'll get mixing now.\nPlease bear with me a moment...
4	Ah, here we are.
5	Here are your Fungicide and\nAntidesiccant.
6	As for the tree brace, I would suggest\nthe Saets Lumber Company.
7	Thank you for everything, Cedwyn.\nReally, we're in your debt.
8	Don't mention it, child. It's enough\nto see Floren's radiant smile.
9	Huh...
10	Ah...
11	Um...
12	Thank you, Cedwyn! Really!
13	OK, let's head over to the\nlumber company camp!
14	Well, take care out there!\nAnd do come to visit, hear?
15	Will do!\nTill then!
qst200826_ms.json
1	Hey, miss-\nuh, I mean, mister! Sorry!
2	I think you might have gotten in trouble\nbecause of that pendant I gave you...
3	Huh?\nReally?
4	The person who gave it to me was\na bit scary, so I didn't want to keep it...\nSo I gave it to you, miss...ter. Mister.
5	Is that what it was...?
6	Ah, no matter. It's all good!
7	We've sorted it all out, so no worries!
8	Really...?\nWell... If you're sure...
9	Yeah, everything's fine!
10	OK!
11	Hey, Rex.
12	Yeah?
13	I'm curious about that pendant.\nWanna check it out?
14	Huh?\nWait, me?!
15	Oh go on!
16	Yeah, OK...\nI'll ask the mercs and investigate...
17	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Nya-ha-ha!\nLooks like even my Driver is\nno match for my charm...
18	Hey, Nia.
19	Yeah?
20	What?\nWhy should I do it?!
21	Oh fine, since you ask, Floren...\nI'll ask the mercs and investigate...
22	Say, Mòrag.
23	What is it?
24	Wh- You need me to do it?
25	Well, I can hardly refuse you, Floren.\nI'll check, with the mercenaries' help.
26	Say, Zeke.
27	What's up?
28	What, I'm supposed to do it?\nYou just said it was fine!
29	Mrgh...\nFine, I'll admit I'm curious too.\nI'll look into it with the mercs' help.
qst200827_ms.json
1	There's no way for you to win,\nso just give up!
2	We don't have any secret information!
3	Hah, about that...
4	I said I had a plan, didn't I?
5	I know how important those stupid\nSaffronia trees are to you...
6	So I decided I'll burn them bit by bit\nuntil you hand over the documents.
7	What?!\nYou wouldn't dare!
8	They're innocent! You can't!
9	Gahahaha!
10	It seems like we've finally\ngained the upper hand...
11	See that?\nWe're starting with three of 'em.\nI let my colleagues do the honors.
12	Give me the documents! Or should I\nset some more fires?
13	I keep telling you I don't have any!
14	Guys, there's no use talking with them!\nQuickly, let's put out the fires!
15	OK! Let's do it!
16	Wouldn't it be quicker to just give up\nthe documents...?
17	Well, it's your choice! I'll be waiting till\nyou change your minds... And burning\ntrees to pass the time!
qst200828_ms.json
1	To make the tree brace, we'll need\nfive pieces of Healing Teak.
2	You can find it all across Gormott.
3	If you can just get that much,\nwe'll make you a nice, sturdy one.
qst200901_ms.json
1	Come on, guys, we need to get going!
2	I wanna go shopping!
3	Everything'll be sold out if we don't\nhurry!
4	What you in so much hurry to\npurchase, Kasandra?
5	Bread, Poppi, bread!\nThe wondrous bread of fortune,\nLucky Dawn Bread!
6	They make it down at Tilly Bakery,\nunder the windmill!
7	Bread of fortune...?\nNever heard of it.
8	They knead Dawn Hydrangeas in\nwith the dough when they make it.\nIt's supposed to bring great luck.
9	The lady at the inn told me about it!
10	And if you eat it, you bring luck to\nyourself and to those around you!
11	Wow. That's some bread.
12	Right?!
13	It's one of their most popular items, so\nif you don't go first thing in the morning\nyou've got no chance of getting any!
14	So let's go already! Let's get to Tilly\nBakery before they're all sold out!
qst200902_ms.json
1	Mm-mm-mm! That was tasty...
2	You know, I think I'm starting to feel lucky already!
3	Tora surprised that Torigoth have such tasty bread!
4	Tora never realize before!
5	Reason for that is Masterpon never\nget out of bed before midday.
6	Meh-meh... Poppi have point...
7	Well then, how about we make a start?\nI predict today will be the best day ever!
8	This can't be happening...\nToday is the absolute worst day ever!!
9	Hm. I wonder what the problem is...
10	Considering they sell such lucky bread...\nIf something has gone wrong, it's gotta be pretty bad!
11	C'mon, let's go ask!
qst200903_ms.json
1	I can't believe it...\nHow...how is this happening?!
2	Sounds serious.
3	You can say that again. An Armu\njust stormed right into our shop.\nCompletely trashed the place.
4	And thanks to that, the windmill's\nbusted, so now we can't make\nany flour.
5	This is the worst. We're going to be out\nof business until we can get it repaired.
6	Don't worry, sir!
7	We had a batch of your amazing Lucky\nDawn Bread and our bellies are full of\nfortune! We'll help you with your shop!
8	Oh, you're lifesavers. Are you sure\nyou have the time, though?
9	Sure we're sure! We've gotta help each\nother out in times of need, don't we?
10	That's really kind of you, lass. If I ever\nhave kids, I'd want my daughter to\ngrow up to be just like you!
11	Well then, I hope you don't mind\nme bossing you around for a bit.
12	We'll need to get the mill up and\nrunning before we can do anything,\nreally.
13	Otto's in charge of the windmill.\nHe should be at Saets Lumber Co.\nabout now, near the town entrance.
14	Would you mind going to fetch him\nfor me?
15	Not at all! We'll do that right now!
16	Come on, guys, let's go find Otto!
qst200904_ms.json
1	First things first, we'll need the\nwindmill running if we want to open\nshop again.
2	Otto should be at Saets Lumber Co.,\nnear the town entrance.
3	You might have to ask around if he's\nnot there. Could you have a look?
qst200905_ms.json
1	Um, 'scuse me... Are you Otto?
2	Otto? What do you need him for?
3	It's about the windmill down at Tilly\nBakery. It's kind of broken...
4	We've been asked to get Otto\nto come round and take a look.
5	Ah, Tilly's.
6	How'd you like the bread? Attas makes\nsome amazing sweets too. He's a bit of\na local celebrity.
7	I go there a lot, myself.
8	Ah... I just remembered.
9	Problem?
10	Well, Otto's not back from his\nlogging shift yet.
11	Which is odd, 'cos he would normally\nbe finished by now...
12	I hope nothing's happened to him...
13	We'll have a look for him. Could you\ntell us where he went?
14	Yeah, sure. He went to the Nocclia\nTimber Site.
15	Something might've happened to\nhim on the road.
16	Could you head up to the Nocclia\nTimber Site and keep an eye out\nfor him on your way there?
17	I'm sure you lot'll be fine out there,\nbut worst comes to worst, you save\nyour own skins, OK?
18	All right. Thanks for the help!
19	OK guys, let's go! The hunt for Otto\ncontinues!
qst200906_ms.json
1	I see a Nopon.
2	Maybe they'll know something about\nOtto. Shall we inquire?
3	Looks like they've got their own\nshare of problems...
4	We can ask about that too while\nwe're at it.
5	True, true.\nAll right, let's check it out then!
6	Excuse me, good Nopon, sir!\nCan we help you at all?
7	Meh? AH!\nWait...not tell me...
8	...Are you...Kasandra...?
9	...Huh?
10	You know who I am?
11	Meh?
12	Mehmeh-MEEEEEEEH!!!
13	Are you all right? That tree just\ncame down out of nowhere...
14	Yeah, I'm fine...
15	Huh? Where'd the Nopon go?
16	I think he's going to need a hand...
qst200908_ms.json
1	Are you OK?
2	Phew... Thanks for rescue...
3	Me think Kupon going to take leave\nhere...
4	Hey, wait up!
5	How come you know who I am?
6	K-Kupon know nothing! Not want\nto think about it!
7	So you do know something?
8	He's babbling. I should know.
9	Have we met before?
10	...
11	OK... Kupon explain, if only to stop\nthings get more bad.
12	...It about 20 years ago now.
13	Kupon was discussing business deal\nwith Kasandra and Driver.
14	And something went wrong?
15	Not there. Talks went smooth,\nno problem.
16	Problem was on way home. Just after\nme say goodbye to them two.
17	Big boulder fall, pinning Kupon down.\nKupon squeeze out, but then ground\ncrumble and me fall into Cloud Sea.
18	And just when Kupon think made it\nsafe back on land, it turn out to be\nnest of monsters!
19	That's, uh...
20	Sounds like a hell of a day.
21	You poor thing. You had so much\nbad luck...
22	But don't you worry!
23	Now we're here, all that's gonna\nchange! It so happens we're full\nto bursting with good fortune!
24	...
25	...
26	...
27	Uhh... Oh yeah, actually we wanted\nto ask you something.
28	Have you seen a guy named Otto?\nHe was supposed to have gone to\nthe Nocclia Timber Site...
29	...Kupon know Otto. Have exchanged\nhellos few times.
30	So you know him!
31	But moment he left, he captured\nby Tirkin and taken away.
32	Wait, what?!
33	That's no small matter!
34	He surely being held prisoner at\nTirkin Turf near Twin Trunks Hill.
35	Kupon never even consider that\nTirkin show up all way out here.
36	It not safe around here any more...
37	Anyway, you finished asking Kupon\nquestions, yes? Me take leave now!
38	Well... Of all the things I expected,\nI did not predict this.
39	We'd better hurry and get Otto\nout of there!
qst200909_ms.json
1	Greetings, Tirkin people!
2	Skrraaw! Hello!
3	Hello, hello!
4	They seem to understand just fine.\nWe might be able to negotiate at this rate.
5	We did not come here to fight you.\nWe came to talk with you.
6	We have heard that a man from Torigoth\nhas been brought to this location.
7	Is this true?
8	We not sure if true or nots, but\nwe katch strange man, yeah.
9	That's got to be him.
10	Well then, would you be so\nkind as to let him go?
11	Skraaaw! No! We not let him go!
12	Is there anything we could do to change your mind?
13	Nothing! Kan be no deals!
14	No possible!
15	Oh dear. That puts us at an impasse, then.
16	Our negotiations are going downhill,\nlike this weather...
17	Oh well! I guess I'll just have to lean on them a little harder.\nIt would be amazing if we could avoid starting a fight...
18	Sqwrrraaauuuk!
19	Ack-ack-kraaaaaa!
20	Run away! Run away!
21	What...?
22	Well, whatever. Now's our chance!
23	It's time to break through!
qst200910_ms.json
1	You're here to rescue me?\nOh, thank the Architect.
2	It's not safe here. We should head back\nto Saets Lumber Co. immediately.
3	We'll talk later.
4	Don't worry, they didn't hurt me.\nI can walk just fine.
5	I'm sure everyone'll be wondering\nwhere I got to, eh? We should hurry\nback and show them I'm safe.
qst200911_ms.json
1	Otto! You're back late! What was\nthe holdup?
2	I, er, got into a spot of trouble,\nyou could say. These fine people\nhere managed to help me out.
3	Speaking of, didn't you say you had\nbusiness with me?
4	That's right! We wanted to ask for\nyour help!
5	The windmill over at Tilly Bakery\nbroke down!
6	They can't open the shop unless\nthey've got flour to work with, so they\nasked us to fetch you to fix the mill!
7	Ahh, I see, I see. Sure, I can take\na look at it.
8	You can?!
9	Least I could do for someone who\njust saved my life, isn't it? Tell you\nwhat, I'll even do it for free.
10	Thank you so much!
11	I'll head over to Tilly's now then.\nCome along later if you like.
12	All right!
qst200912_ms.json
1	Thanks for getting a hold of Otto\nfor me!
2	I'm pleased to announce that the mill's\nback in perfect working order again!
3	If all goes well, we'll be back in\nbusiness starting tomorrow. That is,\nif we can solve one other problem.
4	The shop may be fine, but we're\nstill a few ingredients short for the\nbread itself.
5	You can thank that blimmin'\nrampaging Armu for that.
6	We have a Nopon called Kupon who\nfetches the ingredients for us.
7	He should normally be back by now,\nbut he hasn't shown up yet.
8	Oh, I hope he's not run into any\ntrouble...
9	What?! You met him?!
10	Then could I ask you to go and check\non him for me?
11	Thanks so much.\nYou're being a massive help.
12	Hushview Bridge isn't so safe\nthese days, so just watch your\nbacks around there.
13	You saw Kupon around Hushview\nBridge, didn't you? With any luck,\nhe'll still be around there...
14	Just be careful, all right?
qst200913_ms.json
1	There he is! Mr. Kupooon!
2	Oh no! He's being attacked by Tirkin!\nWe've got to help him!
3	Go away! Kupon maybe look like tasty\nsnack, but definitely not taste like one!
4	Gyaaaaaaah!!!
5	Kasandra?! This not good, no no!\nNot come any closer!
6	Don't sweat it! Everything's going to be\njust fine. We're here to rescue you!
7	No! Kasandra stay away from Kupon!\nStay away!
8	...Why me?
9	Are you all right...?
10	I suppose we'll just have to help\nhim again now...
qst200915_ms.json
1	Is Kupon OK?
2	OK? No, is not OK...
3	Everything go wrong when Kasandra\naround! Nothing good ever happen!\nIt same before, it same now!
4	After you left, Kupon fell from cliff!
5	Then Tirkin attack and steal cargo!\nKupon had it up to here!
6	Kupon supposed to deliver\ncargo today! How Kasandra\ntake responsibility for that?!
7	Your cargo... It was the ingredients for\nTilly Bakery, wasn't it?
8	Exactly! But Kupon not have\nsingle thing left to deliver!
9	There, there. Poppi recommend\ntaking deep breaths.
10	It's OK. We'll get this all straightened\nout, so sit back and relax!
11	Besides, we're filled up with good luck\nthanks to all the Lucky Dawn Bread we\nate! What could possibly go wrong?
12	Kupon trying to tell you, this all\nhappen because of you!
13	...Never mind. If you get back\ningredients from Tirkin, then\nwe just call it quits, OK?
14	Kupon just hope he can trust you...
15	Of course you can!
16	All right guys, back we go one more\ntime to Tirkin Turf. It's time to get\nKupon's stuff back!
qst200916_ms.json
1	She kome bak!
2	Kalamity witch return!
3	Hello, people of the Tirkin tribe!
4	H-hello...
5	*cheep* Hello...
6	They seem surprisingly timid for whatever reason...
7	Hmm. I bet we'll be able to negotiate with them\nthis time round... Just leave it to me.
8	I'd like you to hand over the cargo you stole from\nthe Nopon merchant Kupon, if you please.
9	We have thing like that?
10	You one who took, no?
11	Just give us the cargo and\nwe'll leave quietly.
12	Maybe we give bak?
13	Yah, give bak, or get zap zap again...
14	Relax. We didn't come here to pick a fight.\nSo...please?
15	She being nice to us...

20	Huh? Another storm's coming?\nWhat a coincidence.
21	No bring zap zap!
22	We not give kargo!
23	Not give! Not give!
24	*sigh* It would appear that's the negotiations over.
25	Well, guess we'll just have to give 'em a whupping!
qst200917_ms.json
1	Mr. Kupon! We got your cargo back!
2	Meh-meh?! You...you really got back?
3	Yup! And as I expected, it was a piece\nof cake for us as we are right now!
4	Probably about time we head to\nTilly Bakery now?
5	No! Not going with Kasandra, not even\nif Cloud Sea freeze over! Kupon go on\nahead!
6	Oh, well there he goes.
7	I wonder why he was in such a hurry?
8	Hey, if I were in his position,\nI'd probably do the same.
9	Huh?
10	In any case, we should head back to\nTorigoth now.
11	Oh, yeah. Right!
qst200918_ms.json
1	We're back!
2	Ah, so you are!
3	Looks like we've got everything we\nneed now to open the shop again.\nThank you!
4	Aww, it was nothing.
5	It's all worthwhile as long as I can put\na smile back on people's faces!
6	You're a good lass, you know that?
7	What do you say to a couple more\nloaves of freshly-baked Lucky Dawn \nBread as thanks?
8	Whoa, really?!
9	Oh, that would be amazing!\nI'm feeling so blessed!
10	Heh, someone's pleased!\nThat smile of yours is catching!
11	Ehehe...
12	Meh... Should all just be careful.
13	Getting involved with Kasandra\nnothing but trouble.
14	Need to put her on blacklist of\ntrade guild!
15	Ah, thank you so, so much for all\nyour hard work, Mr. Kupon! I really\nfeel you!
16	Meh-meh... Whose fault you think...
17	If there's anything I can do to help,\nplease tell me!
18	Meeeeeh... How can be angry at\nsomeone when they so kind and\ninnocent?
19	If only Kasandra not bringer of bad\nluck, would be whole different story...
20	Huh? I don't bring bad luck!\nThere's no way that'd happen!
21	Seconded. I don't see how such a\nsweet little girl could ever bring\nmisfortune on anyone.
22	Meh-meh-meeeh...
23	Kupon lost for words...
24	Well, what does my Driver have\nto say about this? Did we bring\nhappiness or not?
25	Yeah, I think so.\nI think you've brightened\neveryone's days a little.
26	Though I can't help but notice\na lot of unlucky things happened\nalong the way...
27	Yeah, I guess so. Maybe just a tiny\nbit happier.
28	Though some pretty terrible things\ndid happen along the way...
29	I would say so. You've taken great\npains to bring happiness to people\nin need.
30	Though I must admit, your efforts\nwere punctuated by a series of\nunfortunate coincidences...
31	Yeah, absolutely. I think you've done\na smashing job of helping out.
32	But now that you mention it, we've\nhad so many disasters in such a short\ntime, it seems more than coincidence.
33	I suppose you're right...\nI wonder if it's because my powers\nare incomplete?
34	Uh, yeah...that must be it...
35	Uhh, yeah...must be...
36	Er...perhaps...
37	Hmm...I dunno...
38	I'll try hard, really I will! I just want to\nbring people happiness, that's all!
39	I understand. We're counting on you,\nKasandra!
40	Yeah, I know. Well, we're counting\non you, Kasandra!
41	Well said, Kasandra. I look forward to\nseeing your progress!
42	I hear you. Well, we're counting on you,\nKasandra, so don't you forget it!
qst200919_ms.json
1	Otto went to the Nocclia Timber Site.
2	Something might've happened to\nhim on the road.
3	Could you head up to the Nocclia\nTimber Site and keep an eye out\nfor him on your way there?
4	I'm sure you lot'll be fine out there,\nbut worst comes to worst, you save\nyour own skins, OK?
qst200920_ms.json
1	All ingredients for delivering to\nTilly Bakery got stolen by Tirkin...
2	Friends should go to Tirkin Turf\nand get back cargo of Kupon!
qst201001_ms.json
1	It doesn't seem as if the false\nrumors have caught on yet.
2	The longer we take, the more\ncasualties there will be.
3	We don't have the luxury of time.\nPlease hurry.
4	We've noticed the false rumors have\nstarted to spread.
5	The Core Crystal hunters are sure\nto bite now!
6	We've already got a capture squad\nat the ready. All we need now is the\nMerc Group's support.
7	We're grateful to have the backing\nof the Merc Group.
8	Our squad is ready to mobilize\nat any moment.
9	There's not much time, so I'd like to\nask you to move to your designated\npositions.
qst201002_ms.json
1	Girls?
2	No, Blades...\nBut who?
3	Some nice Core Crystals you got there, Drivers.\nHand 'em over and nobody has to get hurt.
4	It's for your own good...
5	Looks like we found the Core Crystal hunters\nwe were after.
6	Huh. So you have heard of us.
7	Come on now, hand over the crystals.
8	Shall we, Praxis?
9	But of course, dear Theory.
10	Let's go!
qst201003_ms.json
1	Heh. You're not half bad.
2	Hey! What are you doing over there?!
3	Praxis. It's imperial soldiers.
4	Hmpf. Come on. Time to go, Theory!
5	Yeah.
6	Wait!
7	Don't move!
8	I'm sorry. It seems I caused too much\nof a disturbance.
9	Special Inquisitor Mòrag?!
10	My sincerest apologies!
11	But...what brings you here?
12	We were, as it happens, in battle with the\nCore Crystal hunters terrorizing the area.
13	Ah, we've heard rumors.
14	Indeed. The culprits whom we were fighting\nwere two Blades.
15	It's likely that they'll have others conspiring with\nthem, Drivers included.
16	We'd certainly appreciate the army's\nassistance in this matter...
17	But could I first ask you to report the\ndetails to your superior?
18	Absolutely, Inquisitor!
19	All right, shall we head over to Torigoth Relay Base?
20	
qst201004_ms.json
1	Two Blades... Yes, that corroborates\nwhat we've heard.
2	How much does the Department\nof Safety know?
3	Honestly, not a lot. We know their\nnames are Praxis and Theory, and\nthat's about it.
4	We're on a manhunt for them and\ntheir Drivers, but we don't have much\nto go on.
5	So far, no one's even seen what\nthey look like.
6	I see...
7	I've heard there are similar incidents\nhappening in other countries. Might\nthey be related, do you think?
8	It's highly probable.
9	We've had similar disturbances in\nGormott lately, and those two Blades\nwere sighted there too.
10	The problem is, we've lost so many\nof our men to them already...
11	If you've already got the military on\nthe case, can't you just send out\na bigger party to get them?
12	I'm afraid the capital's standing army\naren't going to mobilize just for two\nrogue Blades.
13	Having said that, the Department of\nSafety don't have the capacity to deal\nwith large-scale operations like this.
14	But we can't just let them run\nrampant.
15	If we were to try and apprehend these\ncriminals, would you assist us?
16	You would help us?!
17	But of course! Having the Special\nInquisitor's assistance in this matter\nwould be most reassuring!
18	That's all well and good, but how\nexactly are we supposed to\ncatch them?
19	So what now? We go wandering\nabout town carrying Core Crystals\naround in plain sight?
20	They're being cautious now, but\nparade a hundred Crystals under their\nnoses and I bet that'll change.
21	Yeah, but we probably shouldn't\nexpect to go up against those two\nand come out of this unscathed.
22	Oh, there's no reason we should play\nourselves straight into their hands.
23	What's your plan, Mòrag?
24	Rather than waiting for them to appear,\nwe should lure them into a situation\nthat will be advantageous for us.
25	With the Department of Safety on our\nside, we should be able to assemble\na decent number of troops.
26	We'll divide their attention between us\nand a second unit. Keeping them apart\nwill minimize casualties.
27	How will we get them to split up,\nthough?
28	By spreading rumors.
29	Rumors?
30	We'll spread rumors that two deals\ninvolving smuggled Core Crystals are\ngoing down in two separate locations.
31	If we circulate this in secret to enough\nmerchants in the area...
32	Then the culprits will take the bait!
33	We can use the Merc Group to\nspread the rumors without our\nenemies catching on.
34	It'll still be pretty tough dealing with\none of them alone.
35	I know we'll be fine, but will the\nothers be able to handle them?
36	Those not versed enough in battle can\nbe supported by the Merc Group when\nwe set our plan into motion.
37	Would the Department of Safety be\nOK with this?
38	Indeed! We're fully on board with you.
39	We'll start organizing a capture\nsquad immediately.
40	Good. Then let's commence the\noperation!
qst201005_ms.json
1	Look!
2	Don't move!
3	Great.
4	You meant well...
5	But still, you've fallen into our trap.
6	Huh?
7	Pincer attack?! We in tight squeeze!
8	Looks like they read us like a book.
9	Heh heh heh... You thought you had us, did you?
10	I've put paid to a thousand fools like you in my time.
11	And you thought I wouldn't see right through your little plan?
12	I think your little soldier friends\nhave already copped it about now.
13	I think you underestimate the Ardainian Empire.
14	Heh heh. I'm not so sure. We're quite the\ncapable bunch too, you know.
15	Since we're putting all the Core Crystals\nwe've taken to veeeery good use...
16	Well, we'll just have to put those skills\nto the test then, won't we?
17	Heh heh... I'm gonna enjoy this.
18	Praxis! Theory! Take 'em down!
qst201006_ms.json
1	Driving us into a corner, eh? I've gotta\nadmit, I'm impressed.
2	Come on, Theory! Praxis! Try a little\nharder, won't you?!
3	You were born to fight, weren't you?\nSo act like you mean it!
4	Understood. Praxis, let's go.
5	I'll set them up for you. Move on my signal.
6	She vanished?!
7	Where'd she go?!
8	Praxis?!
9	The Core Crystal...
10	What?!
11	She turn into Core Crystal?
12	What's the meaning of this?\nHas her Driver succumbed?
13	Damn. They demolished the support squad?
14	Guess the plan to keep her Driver at a distance\nbackfired. Can't anyone do their bloody job right?!
15	Theory, we're leaving!
16	But... What about Praxis?!
17	We can't just stick around, can we?\nShut your trap and do as I say!
18	But...!
19	Forget about that good-for-nothing!\nJust hurry up and come with me!
20	Uh...
qst201007_ms.json
1	Public Government Notice
2	A series of muggings targeting owners\nof Core Crystals have taken place\nthroughout Alrest in recent days.
3	Suspects are calling themselves\n"Core Crystal hunters". A similar case\nwas recently reported in Gormott.
4	The Department of Safety are\ncurrently investigating these cases,\nbut the thieves remain at large.
5	If you see suspicious activity, please\nreport it immediately to the local\nauthorities at Torigoth Relay Base.
qst201008_ms.json
1	Lady Mòrag, I'm sorry...
2	We cut the enemy's numbers in half\nwith the aid of the Garfont mercs, and\nwe were able to defeat a Driver...
3	As a result, we lost most of the men in\nour squad and were forced to retreat.
4	I knew Praxis's Driver had to have\nbeen elsewhere...
5	She must have returned to her Core\nCrystal after he was defeated.
6	I'm sorry we couldn't be of more help...
7	No, you are not to blame.
8	The fault lies with me, for incorrectly\ngauging the enemy's strength.
9	It pains me to say, but I didn't\nexpect to be contending with\nsuch a dangerous threat.
10	Hey, no need to be so down\nin the dumps.
11	It's not like the plan failed completely.
12	We still got one of them. Praxis and\nher Driver are out of the picture now.
13	And we got a good overview of our\nopponent's strength and plans.\nThis seems like a satisfactory result.
14	But we can't let the rest of them\njust get away, can we?
15	Agreed. And I don't intend to.
16	The longer they remain at large,\nthe more victims there will be.
17	Then, we will continue in pursuit of\nthe perpetrator and try to gather as\nmuch intel as we can.
18	We'll also make preparations on\nour side so that we can move at\nthe earliest notice.
19	I wish you the best of luck.
20	Ma'am, yes, ma'am!
qst201101_ms.json
1	Nia, stop!
2	What's up?
3	A lance?!
4	Enemies?!
5	What direction did it come from?
6	I don't know.
7	But I think we'll be fine now.
8	Whoever threw the lance seems\nto have run off somewhere.
9	Why'd they throw a lance at us, though?
10	Maybe they were trying to pick you off?
11	Why would they wanna off me? Anyone else\nhere would make more sense.
12	They probably just fudged their aim and it\nended up heading your way.
13	Ugh, this is the worst.
14	No, if someone wanted us dead, they wouldn't be using\nsuch an unreliable method.
15	So can we take that as a warning or something?
16	Well, I think it's going to be more like 'back off'.
17	Hmm... It's hard to tell.
18	Anyway, there's one thing that's clear:\nsomeone has their eye on us.
19	Just keep on the lookout, OK?
20	Hold on. There's something attached to it.
21	You're right! Let's have a look then.
qst201102_ms.json
1	There's a note attached to it.
2	What's it say, Nia?
3	Gimme a sec...
4	Look for Thunder Crystal in the\nOld Quarry in Uraya...
5	and then stand by at Gormott's\nGaragorm's Arch.
6	Follow these instructions and you\nare sure to regain your memories.
7	...Eh?
8	Whose memories...?
9	It's probably just some stupid prank.
10	That, or it's a trap. Of course, I'd\nmuch prefer if it were a prank.
11	Yeah. In either case, probably best\nto ignore it.
12	...
13	...Wait.
14	What's up, Praxis?
15	If they'd intended to hurt us,\nthey'd already be attacking us\nthis very moment, right?
16	And if that were the case, they\nwouldn't have missed their mark\nwith the lance either...
17	...Very true.
18	So I'm just wondering...maybe there's\na meaning to all this. They're clearly\ngoing to a lot of trouble.
19	I can't help but wonder what\nwhoever's doing this is trying\nto achieve...
20	I think we should follow the\ninstructions. But I'll respect\nyour decision.
21	There's still the possibility that\nit's a trap, but there is merit in\nthe experience regardless.
22	I'm with you, Praxis. We'll do it.
23	Everyone OK with that?
24	Sure. Can't resist a good puzzle.\nLet's go!
25	Thank you!
qst201103_ms.json
1	The note said for us to look somewhere\naround here...
2	Not a single soul in sight...
3	Any chance someone was pulling a fast\none on us?
4	Someone play tricksies on us?
5	I doubt it. 'Cos really, who'd go this far\nto play tricks on us?
6	Get back, my lady!
7	Whuh?!
8	Dromarch! Are you all right?!
9	I'm fine. It seems they never intended\nto actually hit us.
10	Again with the lance? I really don't get this.
11	There! I see someone!
12	They running away!
13	Let's go after them! Uhh...or not.
14	Indeed. I don't believe we'd be able\nto catch up.
15	But never mind that. Is there something\nwritten on this lance too?
16	Lemme check that right now!
qst201104_ms.json
1	Another note...? What now?
2	Now defeat the monsters inhabiting\nthese locations:
3	The Magno Blant near Sternum Arch\nin Uraya...
4	the Bodom Grebel near\nUnderground River Lavi in\nSpirit Crucible Elpys...
5	and the Cherys Medooz on the\nLud Cloudway of the Leftherian\nArchipelago.
6	When you have defeated these\nmonsters, come to Nharil Central\nPlaza in Mor Ardain.
7	Follow these instructions and you\nare sure to regain your memories.
8	First a treasure hunt, now a monster\nhunt?
9	I don't get what they think they'll\nhope to achieve by us doing this.
10	I just don't get it...
11	Praxis? What's your take on this?
12	I'm just thinking... Maybe these\nnotes are meant for me?
13	These memories it talks about...\nCouldn't it have something to do with\nthe memories of my former self?
14	What makes you think that?
15	Hmm... It's just a hunch, really.
16	But I get the feeling I'm supposed to be\nthe one following these instructions.
17	Look at the weapons they keep\nthrowing. Lances. I use lances.
18	So are you gonna keep going along\nwith this?
19	I think so, yeah. If you think I should\nstop, though, I'll stop.
20	I'd just really like to know what's\ngoing on in their mind.
21	Nah, I'm still with you, Praxis. Let's\nroll with this hunch you've got.
22	And hey, you might actually get your\nmemories back like it says. No harm\nin trying.
23	I guess we're going then!
qst201105_ms.json
1	As expected, there's no one here either.
2	If last time was anything to go by, somebody's probably\nhaving a cheeky peek at us right about now.
3	Hey! I know you can hear me! Stop creeping\naround like a coward and show yourself!
4	Another one of those...?
5	What are you trying to tell us\nwith all these lances?!
6	Stop beating around the bush!\nCome out, and tell us what you want to our faces!
7	Or are you afraid of me?!
8	[ML:undisp ]ADLIB
9	[ML:undisp ](gasp)
10	Ah! It's that Blade again!
11	No doubt about it. It's the other Blade from\nthe Core Crystal hunters.
12	Her name was Theory, right...?
13	So it WAS you...
14	You were the one who kept messing with\nus in the middle of battle, weren't you?
15	What do you want from us?
16	If you've got something to say, then say it.
17	...
18	The message said the reward would be 'memories',\nbut I just can't figure out what's going on.
19	We've been playing along with you for long\nenough. It ends here!
20	So it didn't work...
21	What didn't work? Tell me!
22	*sigh*
23	Read the message. It's the last one.
24	Hey!
qst201106_ms.json
1	...?!
2	What's it say this time?
3	...
4	"Praxis, we need to talk."
5	"Meet me at the Lost Capital Judicium\nin Temperantia."
6	...That's it?
7	That's it.
8	So that Blade we met wants to talk\nto me one on one?
9	Seems about the size of it.
10	But why? What do they want from me?
11	Since we know who the culprit is now,\nI've got a pretty good idea...
12	I wonder what's up with her?
13	It's worrying, to say the least.
14	You...you all know who she is,\ndon't you?
15	Uh, well...
16	Tell me! Who is she? What's she got\nto do with my former self?
17	Tell Praxis about her past?
18	Tell her
19	Don't tell her
qst201107_ms.json
1	...
2	You know, don't you?
3	I think it's for the best if you didn't,\nPraxis.
4	If we tell you the truth, you'll-
5	Screw that!
6	You know the kind of personality\nI have. I never get depressed. Always\nbubbly, looking to the future...
7	Rex... We should tell her.
8	All right.
9	Thank you.
10	Her name is Theory.
11	Theory...
12	You two used to be a team.
13	A team? Fighting together like we\nare now?
14	That's right. Except, you weren't\nexactly doing good things.
15	You called yourselves Core Crystal\nhunters. You attacked people without\nremorse and stole their Blades' Cores.
16	What? Me...?\nI...did awful things like that?
17	So...we used to be enemies?
18	We did.
19	We had to cooperate with the\nArdainian military to stop you.\nAnd we fought in battle.
20	...That's how your Driver died.
21	So I would have returned to my\nCore Crystal...
22	Yeah. Which we picked up.
23	But Theory and her Driver escaped.
24	After that, she seemed to vanish off\nthe face of Alrest.
25	I...I can't believe it. I was a criminal...
26	...
27	Praxis... Best not to dwell on the past.
28	You're our friend now, and that's\nall that matters.
29	But...Theory probably doesn't think\nthe same, does she?
30	She probably thinks of me as\na traitor...
31	Praxis, relax.
32	We won't know what she thinks of you\nunless we hear it from her directly.
33	But it surely won't be easy for you.
34	We can go, but only if you think\nyou're up to it.
35	...
36	I'm shocked, I can't deny that. Finding\nout that you were a terrible person in\na past life...who wouldn't be?
37	But...there's no reason to get all\ndepressed about it.
38	In fact, now, I feel like I need to help\nher. Just like how you all helped me.
39	I'll go. I'll meet her in person!
40	We're behind you, Praxis.\nWe go together, to save Theory!
41	Are you sure about this, Rex?
42	It's better than moping around here,\nisn't it? And besides, I want to help\nTheory too.
43	Praxis, let's do this!
44	Yeah!
qst201109_ms.json
1	Praxis. So you came.
2	That's me, in the flesh.
3	I'll admit, I was a little curious about you.\nJust a little.
4	*sigh* I can tell you're not the same...
5	It was naive to think\nyou'd remember.
6	Even after I showed you the antique\nlance you liked...
7	Even after I took you to places we'd\nbeen before...
8	None of it jogged your memory.\nIt's like you're a blank slate.
9	You seem pretty invested in me getting\nmy memories back, huh.
10	But why would you go this far?
11	I just...wanted for us to be together again.\nAs a team.
12	I wished for nothing more.
13	But...
14	But back in Mor Ardain, I realized\nthat could never be.
15	This is my last resort!
16	Well played, Theory. Looks like you're gonna\nget your wish after all.
17	You?!
18	The Core Crystal hunter...
19	Been a while, eh? Glad to see you\nremembered me.
20	A lot's happened since.
21	Praxis's Driver was killed and most\nof my squad got taken in.
22	Not a day's gone by that I haven't been\nthinking about you lot.
23	Look at my Theory.
24	Look at what you've done to her. She's\nnothing more than a coward now.
25	She's nothing without Praxis. So I'm\ngonna have to ask you to hand her over.
26	Excuse me? Who d'you think you are?
27	You can't do a thing without your\nBlades to protect you, can you?
28	If you think I'm siding with some thugs,\nyou've got another thing coming!
29	Ohh, now that's not very nice, is it?\nCalling your old pal Theory a thug?
30	I guess that's how you end up once you\nbelong to a feeble Driver like that.
31	You saw what's become of her,\nTheory.
32	You really want to leave her like that?\nLike a half-broken toy?
33	Of course I don't.
34	I will kill her Driver. And I will get her back.
35	Wait...so you're going to fight Praxis?
36	No. I will take out all of you,\nso that Praxis can be free!
37	What have you done to her?
38	Hahahah... I resent the accusatory tone.\nAll I did was tell her the truth.
39	If she wants Praxis back...
40	she just has to kill you all, get ahold of\nPraxis's Core Crystal...
41	and then...let me reawaken her!
42	Cut the crap! Blades aren't your slaves!
43	It's wrong to exploit them like this!
44	Shut your trap, kid!
45	Life ain't a bunch of roses. That's\nnot how the world works!
46	Besides, you've taken plenty of Blades\nfor yourself, haven't you?
47	Praxis's proof of that!
48	We aren't resonating with them for\nthe same reasons as you!
49	Get them, Theory! Take 'em all out!
50	Stop!
51	Praxis?!
52	Give it up...
53	This is the only way for us to be together again!
54	So please, do as you're told!\nIt won't be long till you're free again!
qst201110_ms.json
1	Oi! What are you playing at, Theory?!
2	Keep focused on the battle!
3	Please, Theory. There's no reason for\nus to be fighting.
4	I'm sorry, Theory. I'm sorry that I can't\nremember who you were.
5	But if there's one thing that's clear, it's that\nyou were someone very, very special to me.
6	So let's just stop this. Please.
7	Gimme a break!
8	She's deluded! Finish her off, Theory!\nDon't listen to a word she says!
9	Get Praxis out of the way and taking\nout the rest of them'll be plain sailing!
10	Come on! Kill her!
11	N-no...
12	What?
13	You defy the words of your Driver?\nFinish her, Theory!
14	No! I can't do it!
15	Good for nothing-! Then step aside!
16	[ML:undisp ]
17	Theory?!
18	Theory... You little...
19	So...you betrayed me, eh...
20	Theory!!!
21	Why... Why would you do that...?!
22	I'm sorry, Praxis... I never meant for\nall this to happen.
23	I didn't really...want to fight you...
24	I know, Theory. I knew all along.
25	Hey, Praxis... Am I going...\nto forget you...?
26	I...I don't want that.
27	It's all right, Theory.
28	Even if you forget me, I'll always\nremember what you meant to me.
29	I swear it!
30	That's a...promise...\nPra...x...
31	Theory...
qst201111_ms.json
1	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Praxis...\nI'll...surely...
qst201201_ms.json
1	So, Theory...\nAre you used to everyone by now?
2	Hard to say.
3	You're always such a cold fish...\nWould it kill you to crack a smile now and again?
4	Here, I'll break it down for you.\nJust do what I do!
5	[ML:undisp ]Ng.
6	Still with the stony face...
7	Ahaha!
8	Hey, give it a break. Let it come naturally.
9	Just relax, yeah?
10	Sure.
11	[ML:undisp ]
12	Hey, don't cry.
13	B-but...
14	C'mon, I'll go search too.\nJust don't cry. It's OK!
15	OK...
16	Hey, Theory...
17	What?
18	What do you think of that?
19	In what sense?
20	We're sisters of a sort, right? Maybe we should\nhelp each other out like them.
21	You think?\nWell, I don't know. Whatever.
22	Theory! Why d'you have to be so vague about everything?\nIt's really not appealing!
23	Do you really think I care?
24	*sob*
25	Come on, Bro!\nGet a grip will ya?
26	*sob*\nIt's not fair!
27	...I'll go and see what it's about.
28	Really, you needn't bother.
29	No, I really do.
30	Being an adult comes with certain responsibilities,\nTheory. Time you learned that.
31	We should probably come along.
32	Oh fine then.
qst201202_ms.json
1	Knock it off, Veero!
2	Waaagh! B-but...
3	Hey, boys! What's wrong?\nI'd like to help you if I can!
4	Nothing's wrong!\nIt's just my little brother, Veero, he-
5	Huh?!
6	B-brother! It's them!
7	Ah?!\nThe one-eyed Blades?!
8	We gotta run, bro!
9	Y-yeah!\nWait for me!
10	Uh? What's wrong?!\nHey, hold up, what's going on?
11	...Praxis.\nStop intimidating people.
12	I did not intimidate them!
13	Anyway, we should go after them!
14	I don't really get what's happened,\nbut it's got to be some sort of mistake\nthat we can straighten out!
15	...Fine. Whatever.
qst201203_ms.json
1	Hey, why did you run from us?
2	Eeeeeek!\nB-brother! Look!
3	D-d-don't worry!\nI'll protect you!
4	Come on now, we don't want to-
5	...Do you want to fight?\n...It won't end well, you know?
6	W-w-waaaaaaahh!
7	Theory, what are you doing scaring\nthem like that?
8	...I felt my blood boil.
9	Oh for crying out...\nTheory, just step back.
10	...It's fine, lads.\nWe're not gonna hurt you.
11	...Really?
12	Yes, I swear!\nJust tell me, why did you run?
13	...Our daddy is a wharfie here in town.
14	But last year, him and his mates got\nbeaten up by a two-Blade team...
15	His mates were almost in pieces,\nand he just barely pulled through...
16	...A two-Blade team, huh...
17	He said the two Blades were girls, and\nboth had eyepatches, and they used\nice and water powers, and were bad.
18	It was you, wasn't it?\nYou're girls, and you've got the\neye-thingies!
19	...No, it's not...\nIt was us, but it wasn't...US, you know?
20	Don't get any closer!\nI won't let you hurt Veero!
21	...Uh...
22	Praxis, it'd be best\nto leave these kids alone.
23	We may not remember any of it...
24	But that doesn't change the fact\nwe've hurt a lot of people.
25	For us it's a past we've lost, but for\nthe people of this town it's a past\nthey can never forget.
26	...That's so...
27	Let's go, Praxis.\nWe shouldn't even be here...
28	...Hng...
29	Hang on, you two.
30	Sure, you may have done bad stuff\nbefore, but the new you are definitely\nnot bad people!
31	Trust me,\nnobody knows it better than us.
32	There is no way to change the past,\nbut you can change the present.
33	There is yet time to make amends.
34	Exactly! I'm sure the people here\nwill understand, if you just explain.
35	I see! You're right!
36	Our past selves may have been villains,\nbut now we're changed!
37	...Hey, you lads. Could we talk\nto your father maybe?
38	W-what?! Why?!\nYou wanna hurt him more?!
39	No, definitely not!
40	We want to apologize for the past,\nto your dad and everyone else.
41	We want to let everyone know\nwe're different now!
42	How many people do you imagine\nwe've hurt, Praxis?
43	I don't think this is achievable...
44	But we still have to do it, Theory!\nAfter all, we've done so many wrongs...
45	Don't worry, we'll make it work!\nI'll be with you every step of the way!
46	...That's...
47	We'll be there too, of course.
48	Of course. We could never leave\nour allies in a lurch.
49	I'm not worried at all.\nI'm sure everyone'll accept them,\nno questions asked!
50	...OK then.\nI'll come, if you're all so certain.
51	But I think it's a waste of time...
52	How about it? Do you believe now\nthat the girls aren't bad guys?
53	Think you could take us\nto see your dad?
54	...Whaddya think...?
55	...All right.
56	I don't think they're lying or anythin'...
57	If you promise not to hurt our daddy,\nI'll take you.
58	Really? Great!\nOf course, I promise!
59	Daddy's in the Fonsa Myma Port.\nLet's go together.
qst201204_ms.json
1	Erm... Are these your children, by any chance?
2	Yeah, so?
3	What's it to you?\nHave they got 'emselves into trouble again, or wh-
4	T-t-two Blades with eyepatches?!
5	What do you think you're doing with my boys?!\nGo away, now!
6	Is he OK?\nDoesn't seem too open to a chin-wag here...
7	Praxis...\nMaybe we should leave now...?
8	No! It's fine!\nAll I wanted to do was have a little talk!
9	Look... Please, hear me out.\nAll we want to do is apologize for the past.
10	Someone, please!\nSomebody come help!
11	They're gonna kill my lads!
12	Wait!\nNobody's here to harm you!
13	Don't come any closer, you monster!\nAnd don't lay a finger on my kids!
14	Look, just calm down.\nShut up, or I'll shut you up.
15	[ML:undisp ]Scared noise
16	Theory... Give it a rest!\nYou're scaring the man!
17	But...
18	It's OK. I'll handle it.
19	Listen will you? We're not here to hurt you\nany more than we already... Ugh.
20	You! Blades!\nDon't move a muscle!
21	[ML:undisp ]?!
22	This looks like an unsavory situation.\nRex?
23	I can see that...
24	Th-thank you!\nQuick now! Get those Blades!
25	That's them all right!\nIt's those Core Crystal hunters!
26	Just waltzing in here, in broad daylight!
27	Hey! Not so fast!\nWe aren't the bad dudes!
28	Another one-eyer!
29	Didn't realize there were three of 'em!
30	Whoa! I'm not...
31	All we wanted to do was talk to this man!
32	Quiet, bandit trash!
33	Well said!
34	Grab the lot of 'em!\nWe'll get a nice bounty if we bring 'em in!
35	Well, Praxis? What do you think?\nAre we going to fight these losers?
36	But...
37	Praxis! Theory!\nI think you'd better give up on the idea of a nice chat.
38	It's unfortunate... But I'm afraid\nthey'll need our help calming down.
39	You two, happy to help, yeah?
40	Sure! Not a problem!
41	You OK with that, Theory?\nDon't kill, just incapacitate.
42	This is an opportunity to show them\nwe've really changed.
43	Yes... Will do.
qst201205_ms.json
1	Th-the mercs ain't cutting it...
2	Damn you!\nI won't let you lay a finger on my lads!
3	Just wait! You got it wrong!\nWe just wanted to apologize\nfor the past!
4	You stinkin' liar!\nI'll never believe a word that comes\noutta your bloody mouth!
5	...Pointless, just like I said.
6	...Praxis, let's go.\nThere's no atoning for our sins.
7	No, Theory, wait!\nI'm not gonna give up just like that!
8	Do you want to live the rest of\nyour life being seen as a criminal?
9	'Cos I sure don't!
10	We're different now...\nTheory, you're actually a kind-hearted\nperson, deep down...
11	I need everyone to know that!
12	Oh dear...
13	Mister, just listen, please!
14	It's true, we may have done nasty\nthings to you and your friends in\nthe past...
15	even if we don't remember it,\non account of being newly\nreawakened...
16	Anyway, I know that doesn't\nmake the crime go away! I do!
17	But our new friends are all such\nkind, gentle folks...
18	They really believe in us!\nAll of them do!
19	So I want to make up for the bad stuff,\nto prove their faith wasn't misplaced!
20	Uh...
21	I'm only asking you to give us a chance!
22	I don't know if we can make you\nforgive us completely, but if there's\nanything we can help with, we will!
23	Even cleaning, or laundry, or, or...!
24	...Praxis, you know you're\nterrible at housework.
25	Right! Uh... Then...\nThen Theory will take that part!
26	Me?!
27	So then I could, um...
28	I know!\nGuard duty, or monster eradication.\nThat's what I'm awesome at!
29	Pff... Bahaha!
30	Yeah, OK, I can definitely tell\nyou guys have changed!
31	When we last met, you were\ncold-blooded killer-type Blades.
32	And now you're, well,\nthe polar opposites of that I guess.
33	Looks like you got pretty lucky\nwith your Drivers this time round.
34	...So, um, what do we...?
35	Ah, no worries! I heard ya,\nloud and clear.
36	If you want to apologize to the people\nof this town, I'll be happy to help.
37	For real?!\nThank you so much!
38	But, ah... Considering the stuff before,\nfolks might be uneasy about giving you\nfightin' jobs.
39	*sigh*\nSo I guess I won't be useful?
40	I didn't say that... We've got a\nharvest festival coming up, when it's\ncustomary to give kids sweet stuff.
41	Around here, it's Whelzaman Cookies.\nHow about you make them and\nhand them out for us this year?
42	I think it'd be a perfect job for\nregaining people's trust.
43	Yes!\nI'll work at it day and night!
44	...Praxis,\nhow do you make Whelzaman Cookies?
45	No clue!\nBut I'm sure it'll be fine!\nSo long as we try our hardest!
46	...You can't make up for everything\nwith enthusiasm, you know.
47	I have a friend who's a great cook,\nshe can teach you. The name's Brabe.
48	She runs a restaurant above the\nsquare in the Fonsa Myma\nCommercial District.
49	Thanks for the tip!
50	...It helps.
51	OK, Theory!\nLet's go learn!
qst201206_ms.json
1	You should talk to Brabe, she runs a\nrestaurant above the square in\nFonsa Myma's Commercial District.
2	Have fun making Whelzaman Cookies!
qst201207_ms.json
1	You're really making Whelzaman\nCookies? Are you sure you're up to it?
2	The awesome design of those cookies\nis like the best part of the harvest\nfestival. You can't mess it up!
3	Ohhh, I'm starting to get really\nworried now... What if they end up\nlooking super lame...?
qst201208_ms.json
1	Making Whelzaman Cookies?!\nYou guys?
2	Whoa! That's awesome!\nThey're so tasty and crunchy,\nmmmmmm...
3	I'll have one for sure\nwhen you're done!
qst201209_ms.json
1	Oh, you're the kids that Volette said\nwant to make Whelzaman Cookies?
2	Yep, that's us!\nWe were hoping you'd teach us!
3	...Yes. Please.
4	Right, right. Volette told me the\nwhole story. Sounds terrible, but\nhang in there!
5	We will!
6	I think I should explain some things\nbefore we get to work.
7	Do you know Whelzaman?
8	No...
9	In fairytales, he's a Driver who's\nprotected Uraya since ancient times.
10	So during harvest time, we give these\ncookies to the children, wishing that\nthey become as strong as Whelzaman.
11	I see...
12	The dough itself isn't too difficult, but\nthen you have to make it into a strong\nand cool face, which is tricky!
13	We'll manage!
14	As Blades, we know all about Drivers!
15	...Even if we lack in artistic inclinations.
16	You're welcome to use the shop's oven\nto bake the cookies, so it'd be cool if\nyou could take care of the dough.
17	Gotcha!
18	What are the ingredients?
19	Five Bright Figs, and two chunks\nof Sparklesugar.
20	Also, two Whisper Tomatoes, and then\na Limdo Flamii Egg - you can get those\nfrom defeating Limdo Flamii, naturally.
21	Got it!\nWe'll be back right quick!
22	You'll need a lot of them to hand out,\nso you better apply yourselves!
23	...How much is a lot, exactly?
24	Well, the amount I said makes ten.
25	I'd say you'll need fifty or so, so\nyou have to collect five times that.
26	Oh boy...
27	But we can't give up!\nOur reputation is at stake!
28	I'll be around, so give me a shout\nwhen you've got the goods.
29	Ah, and no need to break your back\nlugging it all. I can bake 'em ten at\na time, so just keep 'em coming!
30	...Yes.
qst201210_ms.json
1	Have you got the ingredients? OK,\nlet's bake some Whelzaman Cookies!
2	Ho-ho, they came out all right!\nKids'll be pleased as anything.
3	Five Bright Figs, and two chunks\nof Sparklesugar...
4	Also, two Whisper Tomatoes, and then\na Limdo Flamii Egg, which you can get\nby defeating Limdo Flamii.
5	If you get me all that, I'll bake you\nten Whelzaman Cookies.
6	Good hunting!
qst201211_ms.json
1	Aw yeah!\nSomething smells good!
2	So you really made them.
3	We did!\nWell? Look great, don't they?
4	I'll have you know, cookies are a cinch\nfor someone like me!
5	It would have gone smoother\nif you didn't insist on eyeballing\nthe measurements...
6	Hey, c'mon!\nYou promised you wouldn't tell!
7	Hahaha!
8	Oh yeah, since you're already here,\nhow about you try one and tell me\nwhat you think?
9	Uh? Are you sure?!
10	...You didn't poison them, did you?
11	...Should we have?
12	No, you shouldn't! Don't joke\nabout that! And if you do, at least\nmake sure it's obvious you're joking!
13	Ahahaha!
14	Anyway, no poison there, so dig in!
15	I will if I may!
16	Down the hatch!
17	...
18	...Well?
19	Delicious!\nThey're just how I like them!
20	...I'd call them "passable".
21	Great! Hear that, Theory?\nThey're passable! That's not half bad\nfor first time, eh? Eh?
22	...That sense of self-satisfaction\nwill be a barrier to growth.
23	Oh, give me a break.\nA little praise never hurt anyone!
24	...Beg to differ.
25	Anyway, we got the go-ahead as\nwell now, so let's hand out those\nWhelzaman Cookies!
26	Exactly.\nTime to make the kids of Fonsa Myma\ngrin from ear to ear.
27	Roger that!\nLet's go, Theory!
28	Fine.
qst201212_ms.json
1	A Whelzaman Cookie!
2	Gimme! Gimme quick, miss!
3	Yahoo!\nI love this stuff!
qst201213_ms.json
1	You'll gimme a Whelzaman Cookie?\nScore!
2	Deeelish!\nWhelzaman is the best!
qst201214_ms.json
1	Whelzaman Cookie? For me?
2	If it's not delicious, you can bet\nmy mum will hear about this!
3	D-d-delicious! How is it so delicious?\nHow can I even explain it in words...?
qst201215_ms.json
1	Wahey!\nYour Whelzaman looks cool\nand also very yummy!
2	Thank you!
3	He's so cool that I almost don't\nwant to eat him...\nAh, who am I kidding.
qst201216_ms.json
1	This cookie's got a weird face.\nIs this what common kids eat...?
2	Do you think it'll have any effect\non my palate?
3	This is-?!\nWhere do they sell these?!\nI must buy them all!
qst201217_ms.json
1	You're giving me a Whelzaman Cookie?
2	Mmm, smells nice!\nThanks!
3	Let's have a taste...\nOh wow! This is groundbreaking!
qst201218_ms.json
1	A Whelzaman Cookie? For me?
2	I really shouldn't...\nI was about to go home for dinner...
3	But some things are more important\nthan dinner! Give me as many of those\nas you can spare!
qst201219_ms.json
1	Atta girl!
2	Huh?
3	The smile!\nGood to know it's in working order.
4	I...I was smiling...?
5	It's like you got really into it there, and\na smile just crept over your face, all natural-like.
6	Hey, Theory. Why don't you go check on Praxis?
7	No. I'm good right now.
8	C'mon. You've both been putting your noses to the\ngrindstone. Go celebrate together!
9	I didn't really do anything.\nIt was all thanks to Praxis.
10	She just doesn't give up,\nand it's got all the townfolk smiling.
11	Nah. It's thanks to both of you.
12	It's like he says.
13	I think Praxis doesn't give up because of\nyou, Theory.
14	It's thanks to that synergy that exists between you that the\ntownsfolk are smiling.
15	Siblings have a duty to look out for each other, and amplify each\nother. This is what's happening here.
16	So, the two of us...
17	Theory!\nCome over here!
18	Let's all enjoy ourselves!
19	Just go.
20	...
21	OK!
22	I guess I'll have to.
23	My sister gets a bit lonely if I\nleave her alone for too long.
24	Hey, what are you saying...\nI can manage by myself!
25	Hang on!\nDid you just...call me sister...?
26	I-I didn't...!
27	You great big liar!
28	I didn't!
29	Hey! Come on!\nYou know we're about to start!
30	Yeah!\nQuick! Quick!
31	Hey... Call me sister again!
32	I don't know what you mean...
qst201220_ms.json
1	It's OK! Your cookies taste\nperfectly fine! Have some confidence!
qst201221_ms.json
1	I'm sure the other kids will love your\nWhelzaman Cookies! 'Cos they're\nreally good and stuff!
qst201301_ms.json
1	Perun? Is something up?
2	Well...this poster may have\ncaught my attention a little.
3	Poster? Lemme see...
4	"Looking for missing children."
5	"If you can help with the investigation\nin any way, please contact Silas at\nGoldmouth Flight Deck."
6	Yeah, I can see why that\nwould bother you.
7	I would like to meet with this\nSilas and find out more details...\nWould that be all right?
8	Be my guest!\nLet's go meet the guy.
qst201302_ms.json
1	You saw the poster I put up?\nIt would be so great if you could help!
2	The poster mentioned some missing\nchildren... What exactly has happened?
3	Just recently, my son and a bunch of\nother kids disappeared without a trace.
4	This isn't something that usually\nhappens here on Goldmouth.
5	Me and the other parents got together\nand organized a search party, but there\nwas no sign of them anywhere.
6	My wife's so worried about whether\nour son is safe, she can barely even\nwork up the appetite to eat.
7	Of course...anyone would be worried\nin a situation like this.
8	To be frank, it's more than me and\nthe other parents can handle, so we're\nlooking for anyone who can help out.
9	And that's why you put up that poster?
10	Exactly.
11	Sorry to bother you, but could you\nhelp us find any clue to where the\nkids might have gone?
12	Absolutely. Don't worry - we'll bring\nthose children home safe and sound.
13	That's mighty fine of you to say that.
14	Might I ask the name of your son?
15	He's called Siarmal.
16	He's a very curious, mischievous sort\nof boy, but he's an angel at heart.
17	I see...
18	I'm going to do another sweep of\nGoldmouth, so could you guys ask\naround on the ground floor?
19	The kids're always playing around the\nExit Dock and the Return Port, so the\nmerchants might have seen something.
20	Though of course, people are always\ncoming and going from Argentum, so\nI doubt they'll remember everyone...
21	Thank you for the information.\nLeave the rest to me.
22	Thanks. I'm counting on you.
qst201303_ms.json
1	I'm going to do another sweep of\nGoldmouth, so could you guys ask\naround on the ground floor?
2	The kids're always playing around the\nExit Dock and the Return Port, so the\nmerchants might have seen something.
3	I'm going to keep investigating too.\nLet me know if you find anything.
4	Siarmal... I just hope you're safe...
qst201304_ms.json
1	You're trying to find out where\nSiarmal went?
2	He hasn't been playing around here\nlately. Not that I was particularly\nfriendly with him to begin with...
3	I just figured he must have found\nsome other place to amuse himself.
4	Hope you manage to find him, anyway.
qst201305_ms.json
1	Friends looking for Siarmal\nand other littlepon?
2	Watata remember them well.\nAlways playing around near\nwhere Watata working.
3	Not getting in the way, though.\nSometimes even help Watata out!\nVery good littlepons!
4	Watata not see them lately, though.\nIs a bit lonely without them.
qst201306_ms.json
1	Ah, you're looking into that incident\nwith the disappearing kids, are you?
2	I heard the parents organized a search\nparty, but they still haven't been found.
3	Sorry, but I don't know anything\npersonally. I'll ask around and see\nif anyone has any info.
4	I hate to think how the parents\nmust be feeling right now...
qst201307_ms.json
1	Wait, these kids have gone missing?!\nLots of them? That's terrible!
2	It's weird, though. Argentum's so full\nof people, you'd think any kidnapping\nor the like would be noticed right away.
3	At any rate, let me know if there's\nanything I can do to help!
qst201308_ms.json
1	How was it? Did you pick up\nany good leads?
2	No...I'm afraid nobody seemed to\nhave any notable information.
3	I see...
4	I asked around a bit myself, but\ncouldn't find anything new either.
5	B-but they've got to be out there\nsomewhere, right? They can't have\njust...vanished forever...
6	Don't worry.
7	I promise I'll find your boy and all\nthe other children. Just give me a\nlittle more time.
8	I hope you're right... I really don't\nknow who else to turn to right now!
9	Many people enter and exit Argentum\nevery day. Is it possible that they could\nhave been taken to a different nation?
10	That's a good question...
11	It sounds like Goldmouth has been\nsearched quite thoroughly. Other\nnations may be the only possibility.
12	But it would take a long time for us\nall to travel from country to country\nsearching for leads.
13	Perhaps we should make use of our\nmercenary manpower to efficiently\ninvestigate on all fronts?
14	An excellent idea. Can you handle it?
15	But of course. I'll let you know as\nsoon as we have any information.
16	Thank you, Perun.\nYou're a very upstanding individual.
qst201309_ms.json
1	Is everyone here? If I may, I'd like to\nshare my findings concerning the\nmissing children.
2	It sounds like you've happened across\nsomething interesting, Perun.
3	I believe so.
4	Apparently a similar incident\nhas been taking place here in\nFonsa Myma as well.
5	A number of children have been\nreported missing.
6	I can't help but think this must be\nrelated to the Argentum case somehow.
7	I don't like the sound of all this...
8	Nor do I. This may be a more\ninsidious case than we expected.
9	There's an informant in this city\nby the name of Darryth. We should\nsee what he has to offer first.
10	Gotcha. Let's move!
qst201310_ms.json
1	BQ2013 \n＜＜オミット＞＞
qst201311_ms.json
1	So you're Darryth the informant.
2	That's my name and that's my trade,\nyes. Some information you're after?
3	We're looking for any information you\ncan provide about the incident with the\ndisappearing children.
4	Ah, that nasty little business.
5	I've been looking into it already for\nsome other clients, but it's bizarre how\nlittle information seems to be out there.
6	It's got to the point where everyone\nthinks they've been spirited away by\nsupernatural forces or something.
7	So much as it pains me to admit it,\nI really don't have any information\nfor you on that front. Sorry.
8	Oh... I see...
9	Sorry, did I just hear you talking\nabout vanishing children?
10	Yes, we were. Why?
11	It's my daughter Maqqa... She said she\nwas going out to play, but she still\nhasn't come back.
12	I can't seem to find any of the kids\nwho were with her, either. It's like\nthey've vanished into thin air...
13	I was just worrying that this might\nhave something to do with all those\nscary spiritings away...
14	Do you know where your daughter\nwent to play?
15	I'm afraid I'm not sure where she\nwould have gone exactly...
16	Me and the other parents have been\nout looking for them...
17	Maybe some of the others would\nknow more than I do.
18	In that case, we would like to ask\nthe other parents a few questions.\nDo you know where we can find them?
19	Well, let's see... Lacie lives in the\nEntertainment District, and Celtie\nlives in the Commercial District.
20	Oh, and Daffydd should be somewhere\naround Gwenith Paddies. It'll be easiest\nif you go and find them directly.
21	Thank you very much.\nYou've been a great help.
22	And don't worry - we will find\nyour children without fail.
23	Really?!
24	Yes. You just sit tight and wait\nfor their safe return.
25	Oh, thank you so much!\nI wish you the best of luck...
26	First things first, let's go find these\nother parents and ask them for clues.
qst201312_ms.json
1	You're looking for the missing\nkids too, are you?
2	I only just found this out myself,\nbut someone heard they were\ngoing to play around Lake Varna.
3	That place is much too dangerous\nfor children, so I'm not sure I believe\nit myself, but you never do know...
4	I just wish I knew where they are now.\nYou don't think they're hurt, do you?\nThey must be so hungry...
5	Oh, it drives me crazy thinking about it!
qst201313_ms.json
1	You know Maqqa? Helping out with the\nsearch, are you? Sorry, but I don't have\nanything new to tell you.
2	I thought the kids were just going\nto play nearby, like they usually do...\nDid they wander off too far, maybe?
3	Even if they did, what happened to\nthem out there? A monster attack?\nOr were they just spirited away?
4	Ohhhh, why didn't I keep a closer\neye on my daughter...?
qst201314_ms.json
1	I haven't found a single clue that might\nhelp me find my daughter, or Maqqa.
2	I'd heard that incidents like this were\non the rise lately, but I never thought\nit would happen to us...
3	It kills me that there's nothing I can\ndo now but pray they're all safe.
qst201315_ms.json
1	Is this where the kids were playing?
2	I can't see anything around here\nthat would count as a clue...
3	No, nor can I.
4	But the sheer lack of clues itself points\nto the possibility that someone has\nbeen deliberately erasing any evidence.
5	Yeah, it does seem more likely it's\nthe work of criminals, rather than\nbeing just a monster attack...
6	At any rate, let's keep looking.\nWe still might find something.
7	Heeeelp!
8	That boy's being attacked by\na monster!
9	Let's go help him!
qst201316_ms.json
1	Are you all right?
2	Y-yeah... Thanks, nice lady.
3	You're perfectly welcome.
4	You seem to be Tantalese...\nHow did you end up here?
5	Um, I... I just woke up here, I don't\nknow how it happened...
6	I was scared, and I tried to make a run\nfor it, but then that monster, it...
7	You just...woke up here?
8	I always thought that spiriting away\nstuff was just nonsense, but it's starting\nto sound more likely...
9	It's too early to say for sure.
10	For the moment, let's just head\nback to Fonsa Myma and report\nin to Dianna.
11	Agreed.
12	It doesn't seem likely, but there's\nalways a chance this is one of the\nkids she's looking for.
qst201317_ms.json
1	Um... Who's that boy?
2	We found him being attacked by\na monster near Lake Varna, where\nthe kids apparently went.
3	Do you recognize him at all?
4	No... I don't have any Tantalese\nacquaintances.
5	I see...
6	D'you think this means the same\nthing's happening over in Tantal, too?
7	It's quite possible.
8	And if so, this really is starting to sound\nlike some kind of kidnapping incident\nrather than anything supernatural.
9	You don't think my daughter may\nhave been kidnapped and taken to\na different country too?
10	It seems quite likely.
11	But what would someone do that for?
12	I can't begin to imagine.
13	At any rate, this boy is the only\nlead we currently have.
14	Shall we take him home to Tantal\nand see what we can find there?
15	Yes, let's see if we can find his\nparents in Theosoir.
16	Are you gonna take me home?\nYou know where my mommy is?
17	That's right. Let's go and look\nfor her together, shall we?
18	Uh-huh! Thanks, nice lady!
19	Perhaps learning more about this boy's\nsituation will help us to find out what\nhappened to the other children.
20	Dianna, I'm sorry, but could you\nwait a little longer?
21	Of course.\nPlease, do whatever you must.
22	If this is an international incident,\nthere's not much we can do here but\nwait and hope for good news.
qst201318_ms.json
1	Martal! Thank goodness you're all right!
2	Mommy!
3	Well, that's one family happily reunited.
4	Yes... A smile on a child's face\nis always a wonderful sight.
5	Thank you so much for bringing\nmy boy back home!
6	We only did what any upstanding\nindividual would do.
7	There's just one thing we'd like to\nask - do you remember anything at all\nabout how he went missing?
8	Yes... It was in the early morning.
9	I had some business at the shops\nin Elmos Square, so I brought him\nalong with me.
10	But when I took my eyes off him\nfor a moment, he had vanished...
11	I'm so glad he came home safe!
12	Hey, nice lady!
13	Yes? What is it, my dear?
14	Um, listen!\nI think I remembered something!
15	Someone took me to Genbu Port\nand put me on a boat!
16	Are you sure?
17	Uh-huh. But then I had to drink\nsomething funny and I fell asleep,\nso I don't remember anything else.
18	That's more than enough.\nThank you!
19	No problem!
20	Genbu Port in the early morning...\nWe should go and have a look.
qst201319_ms.json
1	Will somebody shut this bairn up!
2	Hurry it up! We have to get\noutta here before someone comes.
3	Don't lay a finger on those children!
4	Crap, are we busted?!
5	Leg it!
6	Those little shits got away!
7	Who cares? Forget them!
8	H-help us!
9	It's OK, child.\nWe will keep you safe from now on.
10	Cast off!
11	?!
12	Don't think you can get away that easily!\nI've got many questions to ask you!
qst201320_ms.json
1	There doesn't seem to be anything\nsuspicious going on here right now.
2	Culprit always return to scene of crime.\nWe just watch and wait!
3	Agreed. Let's keep our eyes open\nfor anything untoward.
4	I don't wanna! Let go!
5	Hm?! What was that voice?!
6	Let's move!
qst201321_ms.json
1	Where were you trying to\ntake these children?
2	...
3	Silence will not do you any good now.\nWhere were you taking them?
4	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Answer me!
5	[ML:Feeling ]...Mor Ardain.
6	We were told to bring children\nfrom nations around the world.
7	Told to? Then there are more\npeople involved in this?
8	Well, of course there are.\nYou think we could kidnap children\nfrom all around the world on our own?
9	Then let me rephrase my question.
10	For what purpose were you\nabducting these children?
11	No point asking us that.
12	We were just doing it for the\npayment our client offered.
13	It's none of our business what\nthey wanted with a bunch of brats.
14	Wretched scum...!
15	Come on. We'll just have to head\nfor Port Anangham in Mor Ardain\nand investigate there.
qst201322_ms.json
1	Lady Mòrag!\nIs there something you need?
2	Just a little information, if you would.\nHave you seen a ship with children\non board around these parts?
3	No...I don't believe there are any\nships of that nature here.
4	Are you quite certain?\nDid you check the cargo?
5	We conduct thorough checks\non all ships that dock here.\nThere should be no mistake.
6	I see...\nMy apologies for wasting your time.
7	What could this mean?
8	Did those crooks feed us\nfalse information?
9	No...perhaps we were the ones\nwho leapt to conclusions.
10	There is another port in Mor Ardain.\nAt the old factory where Bana was\nconstructing artificial Blades.
11	A ship would be able to dock there\nwithout subjecting itself to any checks.
12	And a facility like that would be the\nperfect place for hiding the children!
13	That has to be it!
14	We have to save those kids as quickly\nas possible. Let's check out the factory!
qst201323_ms.json
1	It's the children!
2	So we found them. About time.
3	Come on, let's go and save them!
4	No, wait one moment!
5	Simply defeating these villains would\nnot be difficult, but the children make\nthings more complicated.
6	If we take too long rescuing them,\nthe crooks might use the children\nas hostages. We can't allow that.
7	You're right... But that doesn't mean\nwe can just stand around here!
8	Agreed. So let's split into two teams.
9	I'll play the decoy, and draw\noff the enemy.
10	While they're distracted, the rest of\nyou can get the children to safety.
11	Are you sure you can handle the\ndecoy mission on your own?
12	Don't worry.\nI can take care of myself.
13	Perun... Be careful, all right?
14	Of course. I wish you all the\nbest of luck as well.
qst201324_ms.json
1	Me OK!
2	Weird old guy was laughing lots.\nSaying something about dream soon\ncome true. Was very scary!
3	Thanks friends for rescuing!
4	Me want to go home and eat lots of\nArgentum Noodle Soup...
5	So, I think that's the last of the\nkidnapped children, right?
6	Let's hurry back and meet up\nwith Perun!
7	Looks like that's the last of\nthe abducted kids.
8	We should go find Perun.\nShe might be in trouble!
9	All kidnapped littlepon nice\nand safe now!
10	Time to go back see Perun!
11	I believe we have rescued all of\nthe kidnapped children now.
12	Now, let us lend Perun our aid.
13	I reckon that's the last of the\nkidnapped children.
14	Now let's go find Perun.\nShe might be in trouble!
qst201325_ms.json
1	I...I was so scared...!
2	Those people said they were gonna\nuse us in experiments! They weren't\ngonna stop until they got it to work!
3	If no one came to help us,\nwe'd all be...
4	Th-thanks for coming to save us!\nReally!
5	So, I think that's the last of the\nkidnapped children, right?
6	Let's hurry back and meet up\nwith Perun!
7	Looks like that's the last of\nthe abducted kids.

1	You guys are so cool! Beating up\nthose bad guys like it's nothing!
2	I wanna be just like you guys\nwhen I grow up!
3	D'you think the "artificial Blades"\nthose guys were talking about are\nreally cool at fighting too?
4	So, I think that's the last of the\nkidnapped children, right?
5	Let's hurry back and meet up\nwith Perun!
6	Looks like that's the last of\nthe abducted kids.

qst201327_ms.json
1	I thought this place seemed noisy all of\na sudden. Are you here to rescue us?
2	Don't worry, I'm all right.
3	I was getting a bit worried, with the\nkids with potential shrinking in number\nand those without going off somewhere.
4	But I suppose everything will be all\nright now? Thank you very much!
5	So, I think that's the last of the\nkidnapped children, right?
6	Let's hurry back and meet up\nwith Perun!
7	Looks like that's the last of\nthe abducted kids.

1	Heheh...\nWhat a terrible shame.
2	You went on quite the little rampage, but you can't\nkeep this up while protecting the children, now, can you?
3	There's only so much one\nBlade can do, my dear.
4	Pff.
5	Heheh... Heeheehee...
6	I can tell by looking at you that you're\na pretty remarkable Blade, aren't you?
7	How about coming to work for me?
8	If you take part in my great experiment,\nof course I'll let the children go.
9	Don't even start.
10	Even that accursed Nopon managed\nto churn out a few artificial Blades.
11	So why can't I?!
12	I ruminated over that for a long time.\nBut upon seeing you, it hit me like a thunderbolt!
13	Trying to augment children to create Blades\nwas quite the wrong way to go about it.
14	But instead, if I were to start with a real Blade?
15	The plan is foolproof! I could create\nthe greatest Blade Alrest has ever seen!
16	A genius such as myself\ncould never lose out to a Nopon!
17	Heheheh heeheehee!
18	This is heresy.\nI have no time for the ravings of a madman!
19	What's that you say?\nI wouldn't be so rude if I were you.
20	Acquiescing to my demands is the only\nway to assure the safety of those brats.
21	Or what? You think you can turn this\nsituation around all on your lonesome?
22	I would suggest you think very carefully\nbefore answering, my dear!
23	Hehehe heeheehee!
24	Miss!
25	It's all right.\nI won't allow you to come to harm.
26	There's nothing for it.
27	You'll release all the children...\non the condition that I give myself up to you?
28	But of course.\nI see you've finally come to your senses.
29	Heeheehee!
30	That is quite an attractive proposal...
31	Hehehe... Do we have a deal?
32	But...did you really think I would trust\na single word you say?
33	Hmm?
34	There's no way you'd ever let anyone\nwho knew your secret leave this place.
35	After I gave myself up you would\nno doubt dispose of the children.
36	Those kids are relying on me to protect them from\nthe likes of you, and that is exactly what I intend to do!
37	Heheheh... Heeheehee...\nMwaheheheheehee!
38	Dear oh dear, you are a sharp one, aren't you?\nI'm starting to like you even more.
39	However, all this backtalk simply will not do.
40	If you don't curb that smart-aleck mouth of yours,\neveryone will suffer for it.
41	After I've exterminated the runts, I'll experiment\non you until you're nothing but a withered husk.
42	I will never allow it.
43	I will resist you with every fiber of\nmy being until these children are safe!
44	You poor fool.\nWhy do you throw your life away so?
45	Though Blades cannot truly die, can they?
46	However, your memories can be erased forever,\nand is that not death in all but name?
47	Even if this body is destroyed...
48	...even if I lose every last thing I hold dear...
49	...my will and my resolve will endure!
50	What?
51	Does that confuse you, heretic?\nThis will of mine is undying.
52	Even if you were to erase every trace of me\nfrom existence, you cannot escape justice.
53	Hehehehe!
54	Heeheehee!\nBwaheheehee!
55	Stop it, stop it! ...You know what? This is too much.\nA Blade like you would be more trouble than it's worth.
56	Kill every last one of them!
57	What?!
58	Perun!\nYou need help?
59	Apologies for our lateness.
60	Not at all. You're just in time.
61	Come! Let us deal with these deviants!

1	Curses... Curses...!
2	How could a mere Blade stand\nin the way of my plans?!
3	I won't let it end here... I'll make\nyou sorely regret the day you made\nan enemy of me!
4	The port is right through there.\nHe must mean to escape by ship.
5	Well, isn't that just like a villain.\nI'm not about to let him get away!
qst201331_ms.json
1	To think that even Lindwurm had a\nhand in this operation...
2	He's trying to get away while\nthis lot are holding us up!
3	They're more skilled than the\nfoes we've faced so far...\nEveryone stay focused!
4	Leave it to me!
qst201332_ms.json
1	It can't be. I won't accept it!
2	A genius like me, defeated by\nthese wretches?!
3	Poppi had look at kidnapped littlepon.\nAll seem safe and fine!
4	That's good to hear.
5	The Ardainian army will take care of\ntransporting the children safely back\nto their families.
6	So that just leave this man.\nWhat we do with him?
7	I guess we can't exactly just\nabandon him here...
8	Satisfying though it would be to\nstrike him down where he stands...
9	I suppose we should take him to\nbe judged by the proper authorities.
10	I agree with Perun on this one.
11	Let's hand him over to the\nArdainian army.
12	Yeah, I guess Perun's right.
13	Let's hand him over to the\nArdainian army.
14	Perun has the right idea, I think.
15	It seems best to let the Ardainian\narmy decide his fate.
16	I'm with Perun on this one.
17	I'm sure the Ardainian officials\ncan figure out what to do with him.
18	Very well.
19	Though I feel quite certain he will be\nsentenced to no less than 50 years\nof imprisonment.
20	F...fifty...?!
21	Rex... Thank you for allowing me\nto handle this whole affair.
22	Don't thank me... I don't know what\nwe'd have done without you.
23	It's thanks to you that all the children\nare safe. If anything, I'm the one who's\ngrateful to you - everyone is!
24	Your words are all the reward\nI could ask for.

26	Nia... Thank you for allowing me\nto handle this whole affair.

32	Please, do not thank me.\nIt is us who should be thanking you.
33	If it were not for you, I fear we would\nnever have been able to secure the\nchildren's safety. So thank you, Perun.
34	Your words are all the reward\nI could ask for.
35	I will follow you with pride for\nas long as I live, my Driver!
36	Zeke... Thank you for allowing me\nto handle this whole affair.
37	Hey hey, don't you go thanking me.\nI'm just glad we had you around!
38	Who knows what would've happened\nto those kids if you hadn't found 'em?\nWe should all be thanking you!
39	Your words are all the reward\nI could ask for.

1	Huh?\nAre you seriously suggesting we stop here today?
2	Yeah...\nIs there a problem?
3	Um, hello?!
4	This kind of boring, lame-o location totally saps my Girl Power!
5	What is 'Girl Power'?\nAnd what it got to do with location of inn?
6	Girl Power is a girl's driving force!\nGirl Power is what grants me my awesomeness in battle.
7	If Girl Power gets too low...
8	...well, life is no longer worth living.
9	Huh? It that important?
10	But, these inns are pretty much the same, Kora.\nIt's the same old thing, wherever you go.
11	You do sometimes exaggerate things...
12	I NEVER exaggerate!
13	It's hard to even take proper care of your skin\nin a place like this.
14	Mythra, you know this!
15	I've noticed you've been shrinking into the background lately.\nLike a little wallflower...
16	...Wallflower...?!
17	You mean...no one notices me?
18	Ah, that came out wrong.
19	All I mean is, you could use a little\nboost in the Girl Power department.
20	Rex, you're a guy. Don't tell me you haven't noticed\nthat Mythra is lacking a little something.
21	What?!\nAnswer carefully, Rex.
22	Huh?
23	Erm... I mean...\nAh... How can I...
24	Uh... Rex looks like he's gonna blub.\nWouldn't want to be you!
25	Nia... Maybe we should step in to prevent an escalation.
26	Huh?\nI-I'll pass...
27	Getting in between those two right now'd be suicide.
28	Let Shellhead handle it.
29	Uh... Nah.
30	Putting the Zekenator in the mix would only\nexacerbate the situation, eh.
31	NOW you get some self-awareness.
32	Then we'll just observe...
33	It's just a bit of banter.\nHow bad can it get?
34	C'mon, Mythra... Isn't it time\nyou got a new outfit?
35	Admit it.\nWhen was that moth-eaten thing last in fashion?
36	500 years ago, that's when!
37	M-Moth-eaten...?
38	Well, at least I've got some clothes on! What you're wearing\nwouldn't cover the head of a goose!
39	Huh?\nThat's rich, coming from you!
40	That look in your face...\nYou know I'm right!
41	You wanna see who's got Girl Power?\nIt's on! Bring it!
42	Yeah? You bring it!
43	Let's say the loser has to...ummm\n...do a little dance for everyone.
44	Well?\nThink you can you handle it?
45	Oh I can handle it!
46	But Kora... This is practically a done deal.\nYou really wanna go there?
47	You bet.
48	It's totally a done deal. I'm looking\nforward to kicking your butt.
49	Hey, guys... Do you really think this is a good idea?\nYou're getting a bit aggressive...
50	Shut up, Rex!
51	...Got it.
52	OK. Let's do this. See you at 18:00.
53	You'd better go and work on your Girl\nPower, Kora. Don't underestimate me.
54	I'll show you!
55	I know the score.\nSee you there!

6	No fear!\nWe'll settle this for sure!
7	OK... First up...
8	What's the hot topic right now...?
9	Two whole hours passed? No way!\nI was just having so much fun!
10	Right, so for the next topic...
11	It's nearly the next day, and we still\nhaven't run out of things to talk about!
12	So the thing that everyone's talking\nabout right now is...
13	Erm... Wait for it...
14	Three o'clock already? Why, I feel as if\nI only just got started!
15	Urgh... This is actually getting kind of\nstale. But I can't pull out now...
16	Ah, it's morning already! And I've got a\nreal humdinger of a zinger for you\nthat'll perk you up like hot java! It's...
17	...ah, it's no good. I'm done. I'm all\ntalked out.
18	Argh! We need to settle this!
19	It'd be better to recap from the start,\nbut I wouldn't want to bore you, so\nlet's continue from where we left off.
qst201403_ms.json
1	Oh, I see you haven't run away yet.\nWell done. I'm proud of you.
2	Au contraire, my little croissant. It is I\nwho am proud of you.
3	I thought you'd be turning tail at the\nthreat of taking on my relentless\nGirl Power.
4	You'd better not underestimate me,\nKora!
5	You're the one that's going to be\nrouted by my awesome Girl Power.
6	Teeheehee...
7	Ahahaha...
8	Well, since we've agreed that we're\ngoing to put our Girl Power to the test,\nwe need to decide how.
9	Indeed we must.\nActually, I haven't given\nit much thought...
10	OK. How about this?
11	We'll get a few people to act as judges.\nIt'll be their job to decide who's got\nthe most Girl Power.
12	And it'll be our job to each persuade\nthem we have more of it than the other\none does!
13	Does that sound fair to you?
14	Oh, absolutely. I love girl talk. I'm\nvery confident about this.
15	OK! Let's grab someone walking by.\nThen the real battle can begin!
16	Brace yourself, Mythra!
17	What? This is a piece of cake!
qst201404_ms.json
1	Nia! Just the person! You're right on\ntime!
2	Hey, Kora and Mythra! What do you\nmean by that? Dare I even ask...?
3	We're having a showdown. We want to\ndetermine who's got the most Girl\nPower. A Girl Power-Off.
4	Ah...that... So you're going ahead with it\nfor real?
5	Just...take a seat here, will you?
6	And now tell us! Who has the most\nGirl Power? Mythra...or me?
7	You want me to...\nUhm...I guess it's fine. I have time.
8	OK. Let's get to it.
9	But, how are you going to take each\nother on exactly?
10	Well, we thought we'd try girl talk first.\nJust tell us who's got the most girly\ntalk, in terms of content and delivery.
11	Got it.
12	So...for the first topic...uhm... It's a bit\nbasic, but how about 'favorite food'?
13	Yeah! Sounds good! Let's get started\nat last!
14	So Nia, tell me. What is your favorite\nfood exactly?
15	Oh. I'm on the spot now!
16	I guess...Cream Orange Paratha!
17	Oh really? I didn't think you'd have\nsuch adorable tastes!
18	I don't care. I just eat stuff I like.
19	I'm just surprised, that's all. I thought\nyou'd be more of a meat and fish sort\nof girl.
20	Ah, no, that's a bit boring for me.
21	So. Nia. I'd like to ask you something.
22	Fill your boots.
23	What do you think of Dromarch?\nI mean...as a man...cat...? Cat-man?\nMan-cat...
24	H-hey?! Where did that come from?\nI thought we were talking about food?\nThat's so...weird...
25	But when girls get together...this is the\nstuff we REALLY want to know, Nia.
26	This kind of girls-only banter is an\nimportant component of Girl Power,\nNia.
27	Oh...no...I erm...wasn't just trying to win\nor anything like that. I'm just really\ninterested in you, Nia!
28	Like, he's always following you around\nlike "My lady, my lady!" and I just kinda\nthought, what's up with that?
29	Well, honestly, I don't really give it\nmuch thought.
30	He awakened, and just started talking\nto me like that. So what?
31	But, I mean...you must have noticed\nthat he's a man...or, uhm...male, I mean.
32	We're kind of joined at the hip. But that\njust makes me think of him as a butler\nor parent or something.
33	He's a bit of a nag sometimes. But he's\njust looking out for me, y'know?
34	...HEY! Why am I telling you all this?
35	Enough! I'm going to my room!
36	Aww... It was just getting good!
37	The judge walked out... I guess this\none's a draw.
38	Yeah, agreed. OK. Let's try another\nbout.
qst201405_ms.json
1	Hmmm... It's kind of quiet.
2	Looks like everyone's just hanging\nback in their rooms.
3	Well, we may as well pass the time...\nMythra. Why don't you ask me what\nmy favorite food is?
4	OK! Well... Kora, what is your\nfavorite food?
5	My favorite food is...wait for it...\nBlossom Custard!
6	I like the little white flowers inside.\nAnd it has this appealing wobbly\ntexture to it.
7	It's smooth and sweet when it hits\nyour tongue...
8	Yeah...I don't think it'd be hyperbole\nto say that foods like Blossom Custard\nboost one's Girl Power by 1,000%.
9	Hey, come on. You're exaggerating,\nagain.
10	Huh?\nWell, how about you, Mythra?
11	For me, it's gotta be Cloud Sea Crab\nSticks!
12	Seriously?
13	Yeah! Crunchy on the outside, soft on\nthe inside!
14	If you ask me, it's the best way to get\nthe full flavor of Cloud Sea crab!
15	No no no, c'mon... You can't seriously...\nCrab sticks? Really? They're just a bit...
16	Well, to be honest, they're the kind of\nthing that brings your Girl Power down\ninstead of boosting it.
17	Hey! What's wrong with Cloud Sea\nCrab Sticks? They're lovely!
18	Kora. Don't you think going crazy over\nsweet things is a bit, well...basic?
19	Well, I.M.H.O., they're a lot better than\nfishy old crab sticks!
20	I think we can both agree I won this\nround. I've got the most Girl Power.
21	I think not!
22	I hardly think we can declare a winner\nwithout a judge!
23	And this wasn't really a proper test...\nIt was just a bit of chit-chat. You can't\njust make up rules like that!
24	Yeah, I guess you're right.
25	Hmmm... Doesn't look like anyone's\ngoing to show up though...
26	But we need to settle this!
qst201406_ms.json
1	Hello Mythra. Hello Kora.\nWhat are Mythra and Kora doing?
2	Poppi! You turned up at\njust the right time!
3	As it happens, Kora and I are facing off\nto see who has the most Girl Power.\nWe'd like to ask you to judge.
4	Understood! Poppi here to help!
5	Poppi's just the sort to give us an\nimpartial measurement of our Girl\nPower!
6	OK! We can talk about some real\ngirl stuff now. Who we're into!
7	That's what it's all about, huh?
8	Kora... Can't you change it up a bit?\nYou're obsessed with this topic...
9	How about you, Poppi?
10	Hey, I'd be pretty curious to hear how\nyou'd answer that, Poppi!
11	Poppi not really sure what Kora is\ntalking about.
12	We're telling each other who our\nspecial someone is, Poppi.
13	I mean, like, who do you like...
14	Poppi likes everyone!
15	Ah, no... That's not what she means.
16	Poppi think Girl Power have other\naspects. Like organizing life and\nfulfilling goals.
17	Poppi have extensive sub-routines and\nsoftware libraries for making life\nsuccessful.
18	Based on criteria like task-completion,\npunctuality and efficiency, Poppi have\nmuch Girl Power.
19	Erm...I guess she's right...
20	Ah...yeah, I have a bit of a blind spot\nfor that sort of thing.
21	So according to Poppi's calculations,\nwinner is Poppi! Please applaud!
22	Hey...we can't settle it just like that!
23	Yeah... We've got no hope of winning\nagainst Poppi's robotic brain.
24	Looks like another draw.
25	Yup.
qst201407_ms.json
1	Oh, Mythra and Kora! Could you be\nin the midst of your big Girl-off?
2	Oh! Pandoria!
3	We need you to judge us on our\nGirl Power-driven chatting skills.
4	Sounds fun.\nI'm game.
5	So what do we talk about?
6	So far we've done favorite foods and...\nromance-talk...
7	Oh yeah? Romance-talk, huh?
8	So... Do you two have a certain special\nsomeone in your sights?
9	Ah, well that's certainly an interesting\ntopic...but there's no one right now.
10	Erm...same here.
11	Oh, Mythra... You're a closed book,\naren't you?
12	I think there is someone.\nA certain...
13	NO! There's no one. I swear!
14	What about you, Pandoria?\nWho do you like?
15	Yeah! 'Fess up!
16	What about Zeke?\nDo you think that could go somewhere?
17	N-no! I...I don't think of the Prince like\nthat!
18	He's so pig-headed and insensitive.\nNothing gets through to him.
19	I think you must have been paying a\nfair bit of attention to him, to make an\nobservation like that.
20	C'mon! What do you really think about\nthe ol' Zekenator? Spill it!
21	NO! I won't...
22	I won't tell you!
23	There she goes.
24	Pandoria's surprisingly shy, huh.
25	Well, we've lost another judge.\nI guess it's another draw.
26	Oh, well. Can't be helped!
qst201408_ms.json
1	Hey! Silence!
2	You have disturbed the royal slumber.\nThis we cannot forgive, even if you\nare way cute.
3	It's really not good for your looks to\nstay up like this! For our sake, why\ndon't you go to bed yourselves?
4	Sheba!
5	Mythra and I are trying to settle who's\ngot the most Girl Power.
6	We really think you ought to have\nincluded us from the start. But it\nsounds fun, nevertheless!
7	We want you to judge which one of us\nhas the most Girl Power, Sheba.
8	Very well! We will oversee\nyour contest!
9	OK. Let's get down to it. Let's talk\nabout who we're into.
10	Wow, that really is all you think about...
11	So. Sheba. Tell us what qualities your\nideal man would have.
12	Yeah, I mean, you only like girls. So I'd\nbe interested to hear what kind of\nguy you'd be into, if you were, that is.
13	Well, we suppose that a man\nmust be financially solvent.
14	Financially solvent?
15	Yes. Who likes to share?
16	But of course, we imagine there are\nother vital traits.
17	If we were interested, excellent\nmanners and breeding would be\na must.
18	For example, he'd need to know how\nto serve tea, scrub a bathtub, and have\na nice villa by the lake.
19	Don't you think that's a little...
20	That's a lot, Sheba! You're really\nsetting the bar high for us girls!
21	It's just as well that we prefer girls.\nThe man who'd meet our requirements\nwould be a rare creature.
22	We've not really managed to talk up\na storm so far...
23	Well, maybe we haven't had the best\npartners so far.
24	I'm sure the next one will be better!
qst201409_ms.json
1	No one's coming past...
2	Ah, waiting around's no good. Let's go\nand look for someone.
3	Oh! Hello, you two. Are you taking a\nlittle constitutional?
4	...Is that what you're doing?
5	Why, yes!
6	I always take a little stroll in the night\nair, it aids sleep.
7	Huh? Really?
8	Brighid... We'd like to ask you a favor.
9	Would you mind chatting with us for a\nbit, and then telling us which one of us\nhas the most Girl Power?
10	Oh! A thrilling contest, I'm sure!\nCertainly, I'd be happy to join in!
11	Thank you!
12	Well, since we have Brighid here,\nshould we talk about beauty?
13	Yeah! That's a topic I'm pretty\nconfident on!
14	My cleanse, tone and moisturize\nroutine takes some beating, I tell you.
15	And I'm always practicing throwing\ncute poses in front of the mirror.
16	If I may say, that's a rather narrow\nway to define beauty, Kora.
17	...I'm not sure beauty is something\nyou practice. It's something you\nradiate from within.
18	I don't think I really need to go\nto those lengths to look good.
19	I always aim for new heights of beauty!\nIt's like, one of my life goals!
20	Ever onward! Always pushing the\nvery boundaries of beauty!
21	Certainly, it's good to set yourself\ngoals...
22	A little healthy rivalry doesn't hurt\neither.
23	Of course, the rivalry should always\nbe handled graciously...
24	So, I'd say this one's a draw, girls.
25	Huh?
26	What...?
27	I think you both need to grow\nspiritually a little before you can\nreally hold forth about beauty.
qst201410_ms.json
1	If we just keep drawing, we're never\ngoing to be able to determine a winner.
2	Hey, Kora, Mythra! Have you two been\nhere chatting the whole time?
3	Actually, we're trying to work out\nwhich one of us has the most\nGirl Power.
4	Yeah. Praxis, could you\nadjudicate for us?
5	Hey, wait a sec...\nAre you sure we should ask Praxis?
6	I mean, maybe we should ask someone\nwho's a bit more girly.
7	...
8	Yes, perhaps she's not the best\ncandidate...
9	If I'm being honest, she's probably not\nup to the task...
10	...Hey! You don't have to keep going\non and on about it, y'know!
11	Anyway, if it's Girl Power you're after,\nI'll have you know I've got plenty!
12	More in fact!
13	Huh? No way!
14	But you're so untidy, and always losing\nthings in your mess.
15	And when you eat the food\ngoes everywhere! Ugh...
16	You think Girl Power's all about\nwaltzing about like a little butterfly?\nNo! It's about being true to yourself!
17	Don't you think that means you\ndon't have much Girl Power?
18	Yeah, yeah! And I really think you\nshould stop leaping into the bath like\nyou always do.
19	I tell you what, you two can just figure\nout a winner amongst yourselves.
20	What a couple of jerks! I have had\nenough!
21	Erm... Maybe we did say a bit too much\nthere...
22	Maybe we should take her a little\nsomething later to try and make it up.
23	Yeah, I think so.
qst201411_ms.json
1	I heard from Nia about your little\ncontest. Are you still at it?
2	Yeah, it's all good! Maybe you can\njudge our Girl Power for us, Mòrag!
3	Well, I only came out here to get some\nwater... But, of course, why not?
4	Mòrag... Do you ever desire a bit of\nromance?
5	I am a soldier of the Ardainian Empire.
6	Romance would divert valuable time\naway from perfecting my military arts.
7	Don't you get sick of all that fighting?
8	No, as it happens.
9	Nothing beats cultivating one's\ncharacter together with one's friends.
10	It's an enjoyable and worthwhile\nactivity. This is how I've always looked\nat it.
11	Mòrag, you take life too seriously.\nDon't you ever just want to take a\nbreak?
12	No, not all. To be honest, I think you,\nand all our Blades here, are lacking\ndedication.
13	If you were Ardainian Army Blades,\nyou'd be living a much more focused\nlife, I can tell you.
14	Ardainian Blades would never stay up\nhalf the night in frivolous chatter.\nThey'd rest up for the next day!
15	A first-rate fighter never lets up on her\ntraining.
16	This applies all the more while you're\nyoung. You need to be strict with your\nroutine and rid yourself of bad habits!
17	Erm...Mòrag...?
18	You got your point across pretty clearly\nthere, Mòrag. Thanks so much...
19	No! I haven't finished yet...
20	You two need to reaffirm your\ncommitment to the warrior life.
21	You should sit there quietly and listen!\nAnd don't even think about running off!
22	What...?!
qst201412_ms.json
1	Ah...I'm really quite tired now...
2	Yeah, me too...
3	But this is exactly the sort of time\nwhen you need to be able to perk\nyourself up!
4	Well, there's no one here. Why don't\nwe talk about fashion or something to\npass the time?
5	Sure, why not. How about accessories?\nI love accessories!
6	I mean, I like wearing them, of course.\nBut just looking at them's fun too!
7	What kind of things do you like, Kora?
8	Hmmm... I guess I'm really into flowers.
9	Flowers are so pretty, cute and stylish.\nI feel kinda healed whenever I look at\nthem. They're great worn in the hair!
10	Don't you think that's a little childish?
11	Huh? Childish or not...
12	...I like what I like! There's no changing\nthat!
13	I'd say that's a win to me.
14	Hey! That's not fair!
15	I'm cuter! I should win!
16	You're a poor loser, Kora.
17	But there's no one here to judge!\nWe can't decide who won with no\njudge!
18	...Let's call it another draw then...
19	It's starting to look like we might not\nbe able to find a winner...
qst201413_ms.json
1	Hey. Still up?
2	Yeah. We're trying to figure out which\nof us has the most Girl Power. We're\ncomparing our girl talk skills.
3	Vale, since you're here, will you be\nour judge?
4	Sure. I'll be fair and frank.
5	You look great even in the middle of\nthe night, Vale.
6	Hmmm... The darkness matches my\nsoul, I suppose.
7	After all, I am what they\ncall a nightstalker!
8	What are you talking about, Vale?
9	I said, I'm a nightstalker. Deal with it.
10	Only the chosen ones can wield the\npower of darkness. That's how you\nknow I'm a nightstalker.
11	Only the Lightbearer can resist one\nsuch as me.
12	Light and dark are in a constant\nstruggle. A never-ending war, known\nas the Sacred Contest.
13	We conserve our power and stand\npoised, each staring at the other with\nthe coiled power of a hungry tiger.
14	But one dawn, the dark shall surely be\nvictorious.
15	And a new world of nightstalker\ndomination will be reborn!
16	Yes... I wait patiently for the dawn of\nthat black sun...
17	Mythra... Do you know what she's\ntalking about?
18	Not a word of it.
19	I've never heard of anything like it.\nNot even 500 years ago.
20	Ah, Vale... She's certainly special.
21	She sure is.
qst201414_ms.json
1	Ah, we're kinda in a bind here.
2	Yeah. No kidding...
3	Every bout so far has ended in a draw.\nWho'd have thought it?
4	At this rate, the sun'll be up before we\nknow who's got the most Girl Power.
5	I'm sure the next person who comes\nby will be able to help us...
6	Let's agree to just go with whatever\nthey say...
7	Got it!
8	Nia!
9	Good timing, girl!
10	Huh? What is it...? I dunno if I'm up for\nany more of your weird games...
11	No, it's nothing strange!
12	We just want you to tell us who has\nthe most Girl Power. Me, or Kora?
13	Girl...Power...?
14	Huh? You still aren't done with your\nstupid contest yet?
15	Hey, c'mon. Just give us an answer.\nDon't hold back! Just serve it as it\ncomes!
16	Out with it, Nia!
17	It's me, right? I've got the most\nGirl Power.
18	No way! I've got more Girl Power in\nmy little finger!
19	You need to back that up with\nsomething, Mythra! All your Girl\nPower's in your mouth!
20	That's what you think, right, Nia?
21	NO! That's not what you think at all,\nis it, Nia?
22	...
23	OK. I decided...
24	Who is it?
25	Gulp...!
26	I decided...not to take part in this\nbloody farce!
27	Nia!
28	Wait!
qst201415_ms.json
1	Hey. Looks like the sun should be up before long.\nWhat time is it?
2	Uh... It's seven o'clock.\nI guess the contest is over.
3	So it is...but we don't really\nhave a clear winner yet...
4	Indeed.
5	Kora... I'm starting to get the measure of you now.
6	I hate to admit it...but you do have more Girl Power than me.
7	Well, that's really big of you, Mythra.
8	You're my only rival when it comes\nto Girl Power. I salute you.
9	[ML:undisp ]Hehehe...
10	[ML:undisp ]Ahahaha!
11	Ah, well, I'm pooped.\nBut it was fun.
12	Sure was! I had a great time.\nMaybe we should do it again sometime?
13	Yeah!\nPinky promise!
14	...Ahem.
15	A-ah... Everyone?
16	So...how come you're all gathered together?
17	Well now.\nYour little contest might be over, girls...
18	But there's one more judgment to make.
19	It's about all your reckless gallivanting!
20	Time for a little court martial, I think.
21	Huh...\nEr...well, erm...
22	Hey, listen...
23	Didn't we help you discover\nYOUR inner Girl Power, too?
24	Ah, yeah, that's true.
25	No?
26	No.
27	DEFINITELY no.
28	I think you need punishing.
29	Really?
30	You can't go around doing stuff like that.
31	Sorry...
32	You should think about all the hassle you've caused us.
33	I know, sorry.
34	Make sure it sinks in.
35	I...we will.
36	Is that a promise?
37	It's a promise.
38	In that case... The epic contest concludes without a victor.
39	That means two losers...and two forfeits.
40	Ah! Great idea, Mòrag.
41	Huh?
42	N-not so fast!
43	Something wrong?
44	...Nothing.
45	Why does this stuff keep happening to me...?
46	Mythra, don't complain.\nYou talked the talk, now dance the dance.
47	Gah! This is the pits!

1	Nothing wrong with staying up chatting.\nBut don't cause a load of hassle for\neveryone else.
2	You'll just get everyone\nall wound up again.
3	If you want to blather about\nshoes all night, be my guest.\nJust leave me out of it!
4	But I think you already knew that from\nwhen I got angry with you...
5	You stayed up all night with your idle\nchatter, did you? I'll wager my advice\nwent in one ear and out the other.
6	Still, I think you did learn an important\nlesson. I'll say no more!
7	Nothing wrong with a bit of late night\nbanter, Kora. But there's no need to\nput others out.
8	You don't want to have to sit through\nanother of Mòrag's lectures, do you?
9	Yeah...I get it now.
10	But...
11	...sometimes it's fun to get caught up\nin conversation, don't you think?
12	I hope we'll get chance for a little\ntête-à-tête sometime soon...
13	I hope we'll get chance for a little\ntête-à-tête sometime soon...
14	I hope we'll get chance for a little\ntête-à-tête sometime soon...
15	I hope we'll get chance for a little\ntête-à-tête sometime soon...
16	Yeah, well, I'd look forward to that too.\nYou're good company, Kora.
17	Well, OK. But we'll have to fix it so\nMòrag doesn't find us and give us a\nlecture.
18	I'm game for that, Kora. I don't mind\nsaying, you're an absolute hoot.
19	You don't seem chastened at all...\nWhy, there's something to admire in\nthat, Kora.
qst201501_ms.json
1	Ugh... Not my lucky day.
2	What's wrong?
3	Oh, nothing much. Only managed\nto sink my bloody ship!
4	My crew are safe and sound, but my\ncargo? Probably lying at the bottom\nof the Cloud Sea by now.
5	Now I'm up a creek without a paddle...
6	That's awful...
7	This ship of yours... It was carrying\nGormotti cargo, am I right?
8	You...you're the witch!
9	Some of my crew said they saw\na witch in the distance as the ship\nwas sinking, but I never thought...
10	Oh no...
11	Screw the plan! I'm gettin' outta here!
12	Ah, wait...!
13	A speedy fellow, isn't he?
14	What was all that about?
15	Running away at the sight of\nsomeone's face. How rude.
16	Azami, you seem to know about this\nsunken ship business. Could you\nenlighten us?
17	But of course. It was all a part of my\nrecon mission.
18	So you would also know the reason\nwhy it sank?
19	Ahaha, naturally! Because I was the\none who sank it!
20	You sank it?! But why?
21	Oh, come on, it's not such a big deal.
22	They were behaving so openly\nsuspicious. Clearly shipping cargo\nof a dubious nature.
23	Sinking their ship seemed the sensible\ncourse of action. It put an end to their\nmischief and lightened my workload.
24	Even so, that seems to be going a little\noverboard...
25	I was lonely! Can you blame me?
26	Lonely? You sunk their ship because\nyou were lonely?!
27	Now don't give me that. You know\nI'm just dying to be with my beloved\nDriver...
28	Can't you try to see things from my\nperspective?
29	Besides, I never wanted to be doing\nrecon in the first place...
30	There should have been someone\nto keep me company!
31	I get lonely very easily, you know...
32	Still...
33	Actually, I can sort of see where\nshe's coming from...
34	Maybe we could accompany her\non her mission?
35	Oh? My darling Driver will join me?
36	Then I'll be a good girl from now on.\nI'll do as I'm told.
37	Mòrag? What do you want to do?
38	Hmm. Well, I'd rather this than have\nher running out of control.
39	So you'll join me?! Oh, this is perfect!
40	All right, I'll get straight back to\nsurveillance duty.
41	Off we go to the Great Blowhole!
qst201502_ms.json
1	All of you, come on! We haven't\ngot all day to spend on this.
2	Azami seem very excited for\nsuch simple mission.
3	Nah, I'm sure she's just glad to\nhave all her friends on board.
4	I think so too.
5	Everything is more fun when you can\ndo it with those you care about, right?
6	Still, you did the surveillance\nfrom here?
7	Yes, that's right. There couldn't be\na better place for it.
8	But there's practically nothing around here.\nSeems like an odd choice?
9	Haha... Just watch. I'll survey the area now.
10	Two men over in this direction, picking flowers.
11	Working with an almost tireless determination.
12	And there's another. Some kind of scientist.\nHe's holed up in his room.
13	Azami see that far away?!
14	That crazy talk!
15	Even with telescope lens of Poppi,\nTora still not see that far!
16	You've been using your powers to track\nthose three guys this whole time?
17	Four guys.
18	Four?
19	Yes. Originally, I had my eye on four\nsuspicious individuals.
20	But one of them recently, shall we say, saw reason...\nand now there are three.
21	What exactly is it that they're doing?
22	It's difficult to tell, just watching from afar.
23	All I can say right now is that they're making some substance\nfrom the flowers and then shipping it out of the country.
24	Hmm... I wonder what they're trying to do...
25	You can't identify the genus of flower?
26	Sorry, I'm afraid I couldn't tell you.\nI don't know much about botany.
27	All right.
28	Hey... Why don't we go up and\nask them ourselves?
29	What, all three of them?
30	Yes, all three. If we put the squeeze on them...
31	I'm sure they'll be happy to tell us\nwhat flowers they're picking and why.
32	Hmm, not sure about this...
33	I've grown so tired of all this watching\nand waiting.
34	I wanna finally have some fun with my cutie-pie Driver, haha.\nCome on, let's go introduce ourselves.
qst201503_ms.json
1	Uh, excuse me...\nCan we ask you something?
2	...
3	Hellooo?
4	Would you mind telling us why you are\nso intent on picking all these flowers?
5	What's it to you? Are you tired of life\nor something?
6	I don't believe they intend on being\nentirely open with us.
7	Heh. Looks like we'll just have to beat\nit outta them, won't we?
qst201504_ms.json
1	Now then, care to tell us what the\ndeal is with these flowers you've\nbeen picking?
2	...Hmph.
3	Giving the silent treatment, are we?\nYou must really enjoy pain.
4	Leave him be, Azami. He won't talk.
5	Then what would you propose?
6	What about those wooden crates?\nLet's have a look in there.
7	That's where they seem to have been\nputting all the flowers...
8	We may find out what's going on here\nif we examine the flowers themselves.
qst201505_ms.json
1	Now then, what's in these boxes...?
2	OK, boxes, spill your secrets...
3	Meh-meh... What inside of boxes...?
4	Now then, what's inside the boxes...?
5	Right, let's see what in these boxes...
qst201506_ms.json
1	These are poisonous, aren't they?
2	Uh, aren't these poisonous?
3	Meh-meh! These flowers poisonous!
4	These flowers are native to Uraya.
5	And this particular species contains\na deadly poison.
6	These flowers... They could be deadly\nif used the correct way...
7	Thanazalea. A flowering shrub that\nproduces a deadly toxin.
8	What were you planning to do\nwith these?
9	Hmph. Hell if I know.
10	Oh, is that so? Then you won't mind\nif I shove some of these down your\ngullet then, will you?
11	...Really, lady, I don't know.
12	We haven't been told the details.\nAll we were asked to do is to pick\nthese flowers.
13	If you wanna know more, you'd have\nto ask the other guy.
14	The other guy? You mean the man\non the outskirts of Fonsa Myma\nhiding away in his little hut?
15	Wha- How'd you know that?
16	I'm always watching, dear.\nYou can't hide your wicked little\nscheme from me.
17	...
18	...She some sort of witch?
19	Hahaha... I'll take that as a compliment.
20	We have no more need of these\ntwo. It's time we paid the recluse\nat Blossomshade Cliff a visit...
qst201507_ms.json
1	It's really quiet. Maybe no one's home?
2	No, they're there all right.
3	And they've been there the whole\ntime I was monitoring.
4	What the plan? We charge in, take bad\nman by surprise?
5	Smash door wide open with special\nmissile attack from Poppi?
6	Whoa whoa, hold on! We don't want\nto go and blow the place sky high!
7	No missiles? Aww. Poppi was looking\nforward to big explosive entrance...
8	As I recall, there should be a Nopon\ncleaning lady on duty. She'll know\nwhat's going on inside.
9	So it's just a matter of asking this\nNopon cleaner then. Great, let's go\nand find her!
10	She only comes out early in the\nmorning. That will be our chance\nto get a hold of her.
11	Wow. Azami know everything.\nMaybe too much everything...
12	Oh, there's plenty of things I don't\nknow. I only learn by watching from\nthe shadows...
qst201508_ms.json
1	Mm? Friends asking Tolulu about\ntenant's research?
2	T-terrible sorries, but Tolulu only deal\nwith day-to-daycare of property. Not\nknow about business of tenant.
3	Tolulu not know single thing, so would\nappreciate if friends could leave now!
4	Meh-meh?! Tolulu feeling immense\nweight of Noponic disapproval...
5	...
6	OK, Tolulu spill beans. But friends\npromise not to tell! Promise?
7	Tolulu employed by botanist name\nof Packle.
8	He always shut away inside.\nOnly ever opens door for Tolulu.
9	Needs special knock to get in. Need to\nknock on door 16 times. It get sore on\nTolulu's wings. Friends maybe try that?
10	Remember, not word came from\nTolulu's mouth!
11	Tolulu hired to clean property, not rat\non tenants!
12	Tolulu not tell anything, not long as\nTolulu paid to do job!
qst201509_ms.json
1	16 times, was it?
2	I was watching very closely, but\nI must have overlooked that part.
3	You can't be expected to keep watch\nevery hour of the day. Even the\ngreatest of Blades make mistakes.
4	You're right. Thank you.
5	All right. Opportunity knocks...
6	*knock knock knock knock knock\nknock knock knock knock knock knock\nknock knock knock knock knock...*
7	Whew. The Nopon was right.\nThat was a little tiring on the arms...
8	Packle, I presume?
9	Yes, that is my name.\nAnd you are...?
10	We couldn't help but notice you've\nbeen gathering large quantities of\nThanazalea. Care to tell us why?
11	Thanazalea?! I-I don't know what\nyou're talking about...
12	Oh really...
13	You were extracting their toxins to\nmake poison, weren't you? And\nquite a potent poison at that...
14	What...? How did you...
15	There's nothing that slips past me,\nmy dear.
16	I don't suppose you know, but the\nvessel carrying your shipments sailed\nits final voyage a short while ago...
17	Oh, and you should probably know that\nyour two hired hands won't be picking\nany more flowers either.
18	Oh, my. You're all alone with no one\nleft to help you. You poor soul.
19	I'm going to ask you nicely. Give it up\nand tell us what you've been trying to\ndo here.
20	I...I'll never tell! Never!
21	I would really advise you to co-operate\nwith us here. For your own good.
22	My Clairvoyant Eye sees all.\nSo don't try any funny business,\nbecause it's not going to work.
23	Ugh...
24	The game's up. Why don't you just\ncome clean? You'll feel a whole lot\nbetter, trust me.
25	...I was contracted. By a man from\nGormott.
26	The poison I've been making...\nThanatitan... I was meant to send it\nby boat to my contractor, overseas.
27	Normally we'd have been able to do\nit in two shipments.
28	But the previous ship sank before\nit reached its destination, and the\npoison along with it.
29	That would be the ship that Azami\nsank...
30	So...we made another batch.\nOf Thanatitan.
31	Which was on the ship we boarded...
32	What are you planning to do with\nsuch a huge quantity of poison?
33	The clue's in the name. Thanatitan\ninduces a paralytic effect on a Titan's\nnervous system, debilitating it.
34	What?!
35	My contractor is trying to inject the\nThanatitan directly into the body of\na Titan to make it weaker.
36	I'm guessing they can still carry out\ntheir plan using the first shipment?
37	They can. The first shipment arrived\nsafely at the destination.
38	What destination?
39	I'm afraid I can't tell you.
40	It was my job to load up the ship\nwith the stuff. They didn't tell me\nwhere it was going.
41	...Clever.
42	So we're at a loose end now.\nThis is worrying...
qst201510_ms.json
1	A loose end? Just who do you think I am, sweetie?
2	Wait, you know where they're\ntaking the Thanatitan?
3	I'm hurt. It seems you were really doubting\nI could get the job done. It breaks my heart.
4	No no, we weren't really doubting you...
5	Hahaha... Just teasing.
6	I'm always willing to go the extra mile\nfor my darling Driver...
7	Ah. She can use her Clairvoyant Eye.
8	Just give me a moment.
9	How was it? Did you see anything?
10	There was some sort of giant ether mine,\nand men doing some sort of work.
11	And there was a large contraption.\nI'd never seen one like it before...
12	The Thanatitan was right next to it.\nI saw Gormotti men too, a stone's throw away.
13	An ether mine?
14	Is there even place like that in Uraya?
15	It was in Mor Ardain.
16	You can see that far?!
17	Haha. Of course.
18	With my eye, no matter how far apart we may be...
19	I can watch my sweetie-pie Driver,\nwherever they are, and whenever I like.
20	Gross.
21	Ahem - we're looking for an Ardainian\nether mine, you say.
22	Exactly.
23	I wonder what the contraption could be?
24	Must be big thing, like Rosa!
25	But...if that's true, then where does the\nThanatitan come into all this?
26	If we assume that they're to be using\nthe Thanatitan in the ether mine...
27	Then, contraption used to carry Thanatitan...?
28	The flow of ether acts much like our own blood,\nin that it circulates around the Titans' bodies.
29	If they use the Thanatitan there, they'll be able to\naccelerate the Mor Ardainian Titan's degradation!
30	Then we've no time to lose!
31	If they get away with their scheme, Mor Ardain's\ngonna be in big trouble!
32	Agreed. Let's make haste to Mor Ardain\nand apprehend the culprits at once!
33	Hahaha... I do enjoy the thrill of the chase!
qst201511_ms.json
1	Stop right there, thank you very much!
2	Turn that thing off, right this second!
3	Pfft! Yeah, right! I'd like to see you try!
qst201512_ms.json
1	Now, you will tell us how to stop\nthis thing, won't you?
2	Ahahaha! You idiots!\nThere ain't a snowball's chance\nI'll ever tell you!
3	And anyway, it's already been set in\nmotion. Ain't no one gonna stop it now!
4	Oh I see. Then we'll just have to\npublicize your deeds to the world,\nwon't we?
5	What...?
6	Transportation of illegal substances\nthrough black market avenues,\nbribery, coercion...
7	And I'm sure you used all sorts of\nunderhanded methods besides to\nget your way.
8	Uh, hold on...
9	Or, I know! Why don't you take a little\nswig of Thanatitan? Just a little sip.
10	I'm sure you're very well acquainted\nwith its effects.
11	No, don't! You wouldn't! S-stop!
12	You want me to stop? But you've\nmade so very much of it...
13	It simply won't do unless you try\na sample for yourself...
14	Please! Stooooop!!!
15	Then how do we stop it?
16	...
17	All right then, down the hatch!
18	Y-you have to operate the switches\nin a specific order! Blue, white, blue!
19	...Blue, white, blue, you say?
20	That's right! That's what you wanted,\nisn't it? So please, let me go! Please!
21	You're sure? You wouldn't lie to your\ndear auntie Azami, would you?
22	N-n-n-no, I would n-n-never...
23	Wow, Azami. You really know how\nto freak 'em out.
24	Azami smile like smile of demon...\nTora shaking in boots!
25	Now Tora know never to get on\nwrong side of Azami!
26	Well, now we know how to stop\nthis thing. It's time to put this\nbusiness to rest!
27	Yeah!
28	Right! Mehmeh!
qst201513_ms.json
1	You heard how to stop it, yes?\nI'll leave that to you.
2	The first switch was...
3	And the second...
4	And finally...
5	Blue
6	White
7	Red
8	Hold it!
9	That was the wrong switch!\nNever mind. I'll do it!
10	It went blue, white, blue.
11	How about now?
12	It's not showing any sign of stopping...
13	So he tricked us?\nEven after all those threats?!
14	Well played. Well played, indeed.
15	This not time to be impressed!\nW-w-what we do now?\nWe out of options!
16	Hmm...
17	Well we don't have time to get that\nman to tell us the right answer...
18	That does put us in a sticky situation...
19	Quickly, to the Mine Elevator.\nI have an idea...
20	Hah hah hah...
qst201514_ms.json
1	Ahaha...\nYes, here should work nicely.
2	Mind stepping back a little, sweeties?
3	Azami? What are you planning to do?
4	Tora confused. Is really possible to stop\ncontraption from here?
5	It'll be fine.
6	I'm just going to do the very same thing\nthat I did to sink that ship.
7	You mean...
8	Be sure to watch closely... My darling little Drivercheeks.
9	[ML:undisp ]Ahahaha...
10	Ahh, what fun!
11	Well? Have you fallen for me yet?
qst201515_ms.json
1	And that about wraps that up.
2	Does it, though? The bad guys got\naway. What if they end up trying to\ndo the same thing again?
3	I dunno about that. The bad guys got\naway. What's to say they won't try\nand pull the same thing again?
4	For the time being, perhaps. But with\nthe perpetrators still at large, there's\nno telling what they might do now...
5	Yeah, for now maybe. But the bad\nguys got away. What if they end up\ntrying to pull another stunt like this?
6	Oh, I don't think you'll have to worry\nabout that.
7	That machine was a rare salvager find.\nI doubt they'll ever be able to recreate\nanything like it.
8	And once they arrest the scientist\nwho was processing the Thanatitan,\nthey won't be able to make any more.
9	Which means that this will be the first\nand last time they ever try to inject\nthe stuff into the Titan.
10	Let's hope so...
11	Anyway, I have to hand it to you,\nAzami. You did a bang-up job.
12	Right... I guess we're good, then.
13	Anyway, nice work there, Azami.\nI'm impressed.
14	I do hope that's true...
15	In any case, it seems our mission\nis accomplished. You've done well,\nAzami.
16	Fingers crossed it's all over then...
17	Anyhow, looks like our work here's\ndone. Bloody good work, Azami!
18	What, that's all the thanks I get?\nCome on now, I deserve a little\nmore credit than that...
19	Uh, I thought I was thanking you...?
20	Huh? I thought I was being pretty\ngrateful to you...
21	Not satisfied? I had intended to\npraise your efforts...
22	What, you want more praise than that?\nWhat more do you want?
23	After everything I've done, the least you\ncould do is ask me out on a date...
24	Well, at least I got to spend time with\nmy darling Driver, so I can't complain,\nI suppose. I'll forgive you.
25	I had hoped the mission would last\na little longer so I could spend more\ntime with you...
26	I really wanted to keep you all to\nmyself... Oh well.
27	...
28	...
29	...
30	...
31	As for that man who tricked us...\nDoes he really think he can lie to\nme and get away with it...?
32	If he thinks he can escape me, he's\nsorely mistaken. I'll find him, and I'll\nmake him pay.
33	Let's see...\nA thousand lashes should suffice.
34	Heh heh heh...
qst201516_ms.json
1	That must be the device carrying\nthe Thanatitan!
2	It's a lot bigger than I imagined...
3	And it seems it's already running...
4	We must find the one responsible\nand get them to stop it at once!
5	The Gormotti man is close, on the\nfar side of this floor.
6	Then we'd better move!
qst201601_ms.json
1	What's that sound?
2	It's Gormotti folk music.\nThe instrument's called a "Torigonda".
3	It's what that girl is playing.
4	She's pretty talented!
5	Truly, a balm for the soul.
6	Hey, Ursula!\nHow are you liking the music?
7	Huh?\nIt's good...
8	Come to think of it...\nYou're a bit of musician yourself right, Ursula?
9	Why don't you introduce yourself?
10	Ah, no...\nI won't, I think.
11	Hey there! Blade!
12	Uh?!
13	I think she means Ursula.
14	Yes?
15	You look like a musician!\nWant to try playing my Torigonda?
16	I... Uhm...
17	I'm not sure...how...
18	Hey, don't be shy!\nGive it a go!
19	But...I hate to impose...
20	Nah! Do it! Go ahead!
21	You're one of us, so if you're interested in something, well,\nthat makes us interested, too!
22	Hey, let's all go over and look.
23	OK!
qst201602_ms.json
1	You came!
2	You're really great at playing that thing.
3	Well, thanks!
4	My family make Torigondas, so I've been\naround them since I was just a baby.
5	Playing one of these is simple like talking for me.
6	Huh? That's so cool!
7	I've still got a fair bit to learn though. Grown-ups\nround here can play and sing at the same time.
8	Maybe you can, Miss?
9	I...I...
10	Well, that's what your eyes seemed to be saying, anyway!
11	I'd like to play something...
12	But I'm just a bit...
13	A bit too shy, maybe?\nIt's OK! There aren't many people here.
14	Yes, go on, give it a go!\nCan't hurt!
15	Yeah! We'd love to hear your playing, Ursula!
16	Here goes...
17	Just a little taste...
18	Yeah!
19	Awesome! What a lovely tune!
20	You're talented too, Ursula!
21	Seems the people here appreciate it...
22	Huh?!
23	So many people...
24	What?\nDon't stop!
25	That last bit was so good, too!
26	Is that it...?
qst201603_ms.json
1	A moment of friends' time, please?
2	Me-meh? Who is friend?
3	Me am Tipitapi, music producer.
4	Some people find name bit on nose,\nso instead everyone call me Teetapz.\nPleased to make acquaintance.
5	Right, so, uh...\nTeetapz, what do you want?
6	Want? Oh, me just become captivated\nby song of this here young lady...
7	Young lady... You mean Ursula?
8	Oh-ho!\nSo name of friend is Ursula!
9	Friend Ursula, me feel enraptured\nwhen hear your song!
10	Teetapz think friend's song could bring\nall of Alrest to knees!
11	What friend think?\nHow about capture hearts of world\nwith me?
12	...I...
13	Friend Ursula! Your song have\nimmense power!
14	...I...\nCouldn't possibly... I'm too...\nshy...and it's all just too much...
15	Nonono, please! Such wonderful song\ndeserve to be sung!
16	Me sure everything go splendidly!
17	...But...
18	...Why don't you give it a try, Ursula?
19	B-but...
20	No, I agree! Just do it!
21	You're shy, and that's fine,\nbut this'd be a chance to\ntry something different!
22	That's...true, but I didn't think\nI needed anything different...
23	You've all become my friends,\nand it's great to just talk...
24	And I've been holding my own\nin battles, helping our side...
25	But the idea of singing just feels...
26	Fine! Is fine!\nTora also want to hear Ursula\nsing more.
27	I wouldn't mind another listen either.
28	...Mmm...\nIf you're all sure...then...\nI guess I could give it a try...
29	That great news! Then let us\nmake preparations quickly!
30	Studio of Teetapz is located in\nArgentum, not far from\nRumbletum Canteen.
31	Me go on ahead and lay plans.\nWhen friends ready, come meet!
32	Hey, Miss!
33	You'll be singing again, won't you?
34	Yes, it...\nseems I will...
35	Then here! Take this Torigonda.
36	Huh?
37	You played her with such joy and zeal,\nI think she'd be more than happy\nfor you to use her again!
38	Are you sure...?
39	I toldja before, didn't I? We make\nTorigondas, so we've got loads more\nback home.
40	Da said it was a masterpiece when\nhe'd finished it, but with so many\nhe won't even notice it's gone.
41	That's...\nMmm...
42	Don't worry about it, I say.\nAnyway, you'll need an instrument,\nwon't you?
43	...OK then.\nBut let's just call it a loan.
44	I'll be sure to return it some day.
45	It really needn't be a big deal...
46	But fine, as you wish!\nIf that's what you want, Miss, then OK.
47	Mmm.\nThank you...
48	I really hope I can hear you play again\nsometime soon!
qst201604_ms.json
1	Oho, friend Ursula!\nThank you for coming, everything\nnow taken care of!
2	So, so, first please come here\nand sign contract document.
3	Is there any chance we are\nbeing deceived...?
4	Poppi also find this shady.\nSomething not smell right.
5	It'll be fine, don't worry so much!\nLook, it took Ursula a while to get\ninto this idea...
6	But now she's got a chance\nto share her talent with the world!
7	We should be more supportive.
8	I guess if there's any problems,\nwe can deal with them as and when.
9	Very good!\nNow contract all set!
10	We can begin with building\nfoundation of stardom!
11	Friend Ursula, we will pick up pace,\nso try to not fall behind, eh?
12	A-absolutely!
13	First of all, we need voice\nthat captivate audience...\nwe need powerful vocal!
14	Next, we also need powerful image\nwhich draw attention!
15	And finally, to stay calm on stage,\nwe need powerful spirit!
16	Not to worry, Teetapz teach friend\nall about it!
17	Y-yes, sir.
18	For time being, we say friend Ursula\nis level one across all fields.
19	That's harsh...
20	In case friend Nia curious, Nia have\nvocals level minus five, image level\nnegative two, and soul level five.
21	Watch it!
22	Me kid, me kid.\nAnyway, first goal is raise all\nareas to level two.
23	If friend want to know levels,\njust talk to Teetapz.
24	All right! Let lessons begin!
qst201605_ms.json
1	All skills now at level two!
2	That mean is time to stand on stage\nand give performance!
3	Wha-?!\nN-no, you can't just spring this on me!

5	Oh, voice of angel...
6	...I-?!
7	Hey?\nWhat happen?
8	Did you forget the words?
9	C'mon, sing more! More!
qst201607_ms.json
1	...I knew I couldn't do it.
2	Ah, is a shame, really...
3	...I'm sorry I let you down.\nI'll go get my stuff...
4	Uh? What friend saying?
5	Even if perform on stage not go\nso great, even standing on stage\nin first place is great success!
6	...Huh...?
7	Song Ursula sing was cut short,\ntrue, but it still touch people...
8	Shy and sweet persona shine through\nand pluck at heartstrings of audience!
9	...Really?
10	Yes, really!
11	If friend Ursula need proof, might be\ninterested to learn that her fan club\nwas established immediately!
12	...That's...
13	Nice job, Ursula!
14	It wasn't easy, but all's well\nthat ends well, eh?
15	Ursula, what about that? Doesn't it\nmake you a bit happy at least?
16	...I, uh...\nDon't quite know what to think yet...
17	Well, no. When everyone came just to\nlisten to me sing, that was kinda nice...
18	That it!\nThat feeling very important!
19	If manage to convey that feeling,\nnext concert will be sensational!
20	Convey...my feeling...to everyone...?
21	Yes! We look to future, after all!\nAnd with that, time for more lessons!
22	...Yes! OK!
23	This time, we aim to improve\neach area to level four!
24	Build own potential, and confidence\nsurely follow! Teetapz think next time,\neverything go swimmingly!
qst201608_ms.json
1	Oh, friends choose right moment to\nstop by! Timing is impeccable, meh!
2	...Why, what's happened?
3	Teetapz lined up next gig!\nThis time, friend Ursula play in\nMymoma Playhouse in Uraya.
4	...I'm going to play in the playhouse?!
5	Hah, that's awesome.\nNice one, Ursula!
6	That playhouse of old man Cole\nnow suppose to be much bigger\nthan before.
7	Ohhh...
8	Ursula, you've worked hard for this.\nTake it as an acknowledgment of\nyour effort!
9	...Ohh...\n... I guess.
10	Friend not happy about this?
11	...No, I mean, I am, obviously...
12	Well then, Teetapz go ahead to seal\ndeal!
13	Friend Ursula, make show\nthat be remembered for ages!
14	Um... Y-yes, OK.
15	You'd better make sure you're ready,\nUrsula!
16	Yeah... I'm a little apprehensive, but...\nI have to see it through...
17	Where Ursula gone?
18	Friend should bring Ursula here.\nHave important thing to tell!
qst201609_ms.json
1	Now then, finally big night arrive!\nFriend Ursula, ready for concert?
2	...Mmm...
3	Ursula?
4	Friend OK?\nHave tummyache?
5	...Mmm, no, my stomach is fine...\n... But I don't know if I can do it.
6	It would appear that she has trouble\ncoping with the excessive stress.
7	But that terrible!\nConcert have to be canceled?!
8	It's OK, there's still time before the gig.\nWe can use it to get Ursula to relax.
9	Trick of Tora when stressed is\nto eat favorite food until calm.
10	Ursula have some Tasty Sausage too?
11	I think she'd just get heartburn...
12	On the other hand, having a snack\nwould form a distraction. It may not be\nsuch a bad idea, after all...
13	Right! So we'll try to feed Ursula\nher favorite food to get her a bit\nmore relaxed.
14	Friend Ursula, what is favorite thing?\nTeetapz bring, right away!
15	Excuse me? That's awfully sudden...
16	Ah, no, we were wondering what your\nfavorite food is. Don't think too much,\njust say whatever comes to mind.
17	Ah, OK, mmm...\nI saw some Champ's Churros out\nfront, I wouldn't mind trying those...
18	Let's say, ten of them?\nSo Beary can try them, too...?
19	Beary eat more than fair share...\nBut no time for grumble! We buy\nand come back!
20	And until friends return, Teetapz keep\nwaiting audience entertained with gift\nof gab!
qst201610_ms.json
1	Excellent!
2	Packed to the rafters!
3	Look, Ursula!\nLook at all the people who came just to hear your music!
4	Are you OK?
5	Yes. I'm all right.
6	Thanks to all the support from you\nguys, I'll be able to give it my all.
7	OK, time to get out there!
8	She really looks up for it this time.
9	Yes yes! Hope Ursula can see it through to end.
10	Ursula! Good luck!
11	It'll be fine.
12	Preparation makes a big difference.\nI'm sure all those lessons will pay off.
13	You've done all the work. So you\njust owe it to yourself now!
14	I'm excited!
qst201611_ms.json
1	Bravo! Bravo!\nSuccess that resound!
2	Teetapz knew friend Ursula can do it!\nEntire audience under friend's spell!
3	How did it feel, Ursula?
4	...Mm. It felt really good!
5	When I was singing, I felt like I was\na part of something bigger than myself!
6	That sounds great!
7	To tell truth, Tora feel that way too...!
8	What the heck have you got to\ncry about?!
9	After this concert, fame of friend Ursula\ngo through roof!
10	Next time, me able to bring\nvoice of Ursula to even bigger\nmasses, book even bigger stage!
11	Where is there a bigger stage?
12	Alba Cavanich, meh!
13	Huh?!
14	Alba Cavanich? As in,\nthe capital of Mor Ardain?
15	Exactamundo!\nOne and the same, meh.
16	Playing in the capital, huh...?\nI can't even imagine the crowd...
17	Nobody ever try to play concert\nin Alba Cavanich before.
18	If we succeed at holding concert\nof this magnitude, friend Ursula be\nstar likes of which world never see!
19	...I...
20	Bit of a scary thought, eh?
21	...Yes.\nA lot scary, even.
22	But...I still want to try.\nIt seems a lot of people are interested\nin hearing me sing, after all.
23	Yes yes, that the spirit!\nWith that attitude, success is\nguaranteed!
24	...Ah, but to fill venue in Empire,\nfriend Ursula will need even more fans.
25	How many exactly?
26	By estimate of Teetapz,\nupwards of five thousand or so.
27	How many?!\nThat's daft!
28	Not at all!\nFriend Ursula have no problem\nin getting required numbers!
29	Yes!\nI'll do my best!
qst201612_ms.json
1	Good news, friends!\nEmpire issue permit for concert!
2	Considering audience numbers and\nstage design, size of this concert is\nunprecedented! World record!
3	W-world record...
4	Is Teetapz TRYING to scare Ursula...?
5	Teetapz is only Nopon, sometime get\noverexcited. Apologies.
6	Anyhow, preparations for concert\nbe completed soon!
7	Don't rest on laurels yet, friends!
8	Mmm... I...don't know\nif I can manage...
9	Is fine, is fine!
10	That's right.\nJust carry on as you've been doing,\nand everything will be dandy.
11	...Mmm...\nRight.
12	All right! So, Teetapz go ahead to\nJakolo's Inn in Alba Cavanich.\nWe hired inn as green room.
13	When friend Ursula ready,\ncome rendezvous there!
14	Where Ursula gone?
15	Friend should bring Ursula here.\nHave important thing to tell!
qst201613_ms.json
1	...I...
2	Ursula, everything OK?
3	...can't...\nI... I can't...
4	I cannot fault her for getting\nnervous when faced with a task\nof these proportions...
5	Just remember to breathe, OK?\nTry not to tense up.
6	It's...no use, I'm scared stiff...\nCan't move, can barely speak...
7	Those are some serious symptoms...
8	What we do? What we do?!
9	Maybe we buy something again?\nFriend Ursula, want eat something?!
10	...No, I don't need anything...\nI don't think I could even...\nswallow...anything...
11	Ursula...\nYou've got loads of fans waiting\nfor you out there. What's wrong?
12	I... I know that, believe me...
13	And I would like to...end all of this\non a high, successful note...
14	But...I can't shake this dread,\nI can't stop thinking these thoughts,\nand I... I can't sing...
15	Mmmeehhh, Teetapz is\nfresh out of ideas!
16	What do we do?\nI don't want to force Ursula to\ndo anything against her will...
17	Is it the singing that she's\nstressed about?
18	Tora think issue is weight of\nexpectations from big-big audience,\nand resulting pressure on self.
19	But think about it...\nWhen Ursula sang for the first time,\nshe seemed to really be enjoying it.
20	She does love to sing, I'm sure of it.
21	Now that friend say, it true.\nTeetapz remember the beautiful singing\nand the beautiful happy expression.
22	Hey, how about we ask that girl\nfrom Torigoth to come here?
23	Ohh, I get it!\nRemind Ursula of how it all started!
24	Right!\nThat might unblock something inside\nher and make her want to sing again.
25	It seem worth a try, meh.\nCan Teetapz count on friends?
26	Of course!
27	We met her at night, at\nTretl Windmill Plaza, right?
28	Yeah, that's it.
29	OK, friends. Hurry-hurry then!
qst201614_ms.json
1	Hey, Miss!\nLovely to see you again!
2	It's you, from before...
3	You know what?\nI've been practicing a lot since then!
4	I've totally learned to sing and play\nthe Torigonda at the same time!
5	I've heard you've been singing\nall around the world, too, Miss...
6	So I thought I'd better apply myself,\nand practiced a lot!
7	...Oh my...
8	Hey, Miss...?
9	Would you mind listening to my song?
10	...Not at all. Please, go ahead.
11	Oh, that's really lovely...
12	That means the world to me,\ncoming from the most awesome\nperson on Alrest right now.
13	No, no... It wasn't flattery.
14	You looked so joyful when you played,\nthat you filled me with joy too...
15	I felt your joy as well, when you sang\nin the streets of Torigoth!
16	My song gave you...joy...?
17	I've heard you're worried about\nyour singing, Miss. Is that true?
18	'Cos, you know, I think it'd be fine\nif you sang just the way you want,\njust like you did in Torigoth.
19	Don't mind the people or the stage.\nWhat you need to do, Miss, is put your\nfeelings into the song, then let it go.
20	...Yes, you're right.\nYou're absolutely right.
21	I don't need to get worked up about\nthe people who've come to listen...
22	I just have to stay true to myself\nand sing!
23	Yes! Yes!\nThat's it, right there!
24	Feeling better now,\nUrsula?
25	...Yes.\nI think I'm going to sing now!
26	Tora looking forward!
27	Teetapz also sure, if Ursula sing as\nshe always do, success is guaranteed.
28	Yes...\nI'll do my best!
29	My song...\nI hope the world's ready for it!
qst201615_ms.json
1	We bring Champ's Churros!\nPlenty for Ursula and Beary to chomp!
2	Thank you...
3	Well?\nFeeling a bit calmer?
4	...Yes, thank you. They were delicious.\nBeary appreciated it, too.
5	OK...\nYeah, I'm better now.
6	Good-good-good!\nSo Ursula will sing?
7	Yes. I'll be fine...
8	In that case, time for concert to begin!\nTeetapz great at rambling, but can only\nkeep audience excited for so long...
qst201616_ms.json
1	Kiara...
2	That went great!
3	Yeah!\nIt was awesome!
4	You could really see how much\nyou were enjoying yourself there!
5	Everyone really loved you! There were butterflies in our\nstomachs! And flapping birds in our hearts!
6	It's all thanks to you, Kiara!
7	You spoke to me... If you hadn't have spoken to me\nthat time, none of this would have happened.
8	Kiara, I've played the Torigonda\nthat you lent me so much...
9	I said I'd give it back to you...\nI made that promise when we first met.
10	Perhaps...now is the time for me to return it.
11	No...
12	I want you to keep the Torigonda.
13	I mean...\nDa can always make another one.
14	Today feels like...\nA graduation ceremony of sorts.
15	I wanted to give a once-in-a-lifetime\nperformance...and I think I did.
16	Me-meeehh?!
17	Really?
18	I've always wanted to be brave in battle...\nTo do my best for the sake of my friends...
19	I've had these thoughts since the start...
20	But out there, on stage...
21	With so many people listening\nto me, to my song...
22	I finally felt complete, whole.\nReady to move on.
23	Meh?! Memeh...
24	That's incredible.
25	I'd be sad to think I'll never hear you sing again...
26	I bet everyone who came here today\nwould be gutted, too.
27	...
28	But, it's up to you, of course!
29	I'm sure you'll do great things,\nwhether as a fighter, or musician.
30	Yes! I promise to make you proud!
31	But I had so much help from the Drivers and Mr. Teetapz...
32	Now it's my turn to give something back!
33	That's the spirit!
34	...
35	...
36	Thanks for everything!
37	You really are welcome!
qst201617_ms.json
1	Nice one, Ursula!\nIt was worth working towards, right?
2	Good job, Ursula!\nAll that hard work paid off, huh?
3	Well done, Ursula.\nA great culmination of your effort.
4	Done and dusted, Ursula!\nWas worth keeping up the lessons, eh?
5	Rex, I...
6	Nia, I...
7	Mòrag, I...
8	Zeke, I...
9	I only made it this far with the singing\nthanks to you all.
10	It felt great.\nIt was so much fun.
11	I managed to convey how I felt\nto so many people out there...
12	...Thank you all so much.
13	We didn't do anything.
14	It all happened because you\nbelieved in yourself and gave it a shot.
15	Nah, this was all you.
16	You worked your butt off and\nwent out on a limb, that's everything.
17	We did nothing, Ursula.
18	You took a chance, and worked hard\nto achieve what you did. Take pride.
19	But we didn't do anything!
20	This is all thanks to your confidence\nand willingness to try something new.
21	Well... Thank you, regardless.\nFor believing in me, and the support...
22	Thank you for helping me\nfind this courage inside!
23	Rex, I hope I can make you proud!
24	Nia, I hope I can make you proud!
25	Mòrag, I hope I can make you proud!
26	Zeke, I hope I can make you proud!

8	Encourage her to do it same as always
9	Tell her to breathe and calm down
10	Y-you're right...
11	OK, I know, I know.\nI've practiced a lot, so everything\nwill be fine if I just do it like that...

1	What do I do...
2	What if...\nWhat if I can't sing...?
3	Maybe Beary could do it for me...
qst201623_ms.json
1	Friends will buy Champ's Churros\nfor benefit of friend Ursula, yes?
2	There is stall that sells them\njust outside playhouse!
qst201624_ms.json
1	I have to sing...\nOtherwise, I can't express myself...
2	But it's so scary...
3	Why does it have to be so scary\nwhen I have to go out and sing...
qst201625_ms.json
1	Teetapz need friends to call on girl\nfrom Torigoth. Teetapz will wait at\nvenue!
2	If words of Teetapz not reach\nfriend Ursula, maybe girl can\ntalk sense into her.
3	Meh-meh!\nYou brought girl!
4	Well, not just stand there!\nHave talkings with friend Ursula!
qst201626_ms.json
1	Hello! It's been a while!
2	Is the Miss doing OK?
3	Ah, I bet she's busy though...\nIsn't her big concert coming up\nsometime soon?
4	I'd hoped to show her how much\nI've grown as a musician...
5	Oh, is that so...?
6	But... There's no guaranteeing\nthat she'll listen to me...
7	Still, I guess it can't hurt to try.
8	OK! In that case, I'm off!
9	I've never actually been to\nAlba Cavanich, can you believe?\nI wonder what kind of place it is!
qst201627_ms.json
1	Do your best, Miss!
2	You're a great singer, Miss!\nI'm sure it'll be amazing!\nDon't worry, I'm cheering you on!
3	And make the most of my Torigonda!\nDon't worry about giving it back, either!
qst201701_ms.json
1	*pant*...\n*pant*... *pant*...
2	Sharpen up, you dogs!\nDawdlers die first in battle!
3	Mattragh, try again! If you did it\nlike that on the battlefield,\nI'd kill you myself!
4	N-no way...
5	Diligent work, captain.
6	S-Special Inquisitor Mòrag!
7	Do Ardainian soldiers train like this\nevery single day?
8	Indeed we do!
9	Every day, rain or shine. We've got to\nbe ready to go at the drop of a hat,\nyou know.
10	Whoa, sounds like a tough life.
11	Pfft. Look at these softies.
12	Softies?!
13	That's what I said! I thought\nthese were just warm-ups,\nbut apparently this is all they do?
14	Warm-ups?!\nYou would insult our training regime?!
15	Lady Mòrag, would you mind if\nI joined in with their training?
16	I'll show them what real\ntraining is all about!
17	Uh...
18	Wait a sec, Newt. You're\nnot an Ardainian soldier.
19	If you go charging in, won't it\nbe more of a problem than a benefit?
20	You're right. Newt has nothing\nto do with the army.
21	Aww, c'mon Mòrag!
22	But having said that, she is very strong.\nI'm sure our soldiers could learn a lot.
23	Ohboyohboyohboy, Mòrag\ncomplimented me! I can't believe it.
24	You won't regret this, I promise!
25	Let's get started with a little\nsparring match, shall we?
26	Sparring...?
27	Yup. First we gotta let you know what\nkind of power you're up against!
28	Um, "we"?\nAre we all doing this, then?
29	...Roger that.
30	But don't expect us to hold back\njust because this isn't a real battle.\nThink you can handle our best efforts?
31	Hah! Go for it!
32	Then your opponents will be our\nmost elite soldiers!
33	Oh, and you too, Mattragh!\nYou could do with seeing how a real\nsoldier fights, up close and personal!
34	Whaaaaaaa?!
35	Well then, let's all give this\nour best shot!
qst201702_ms.json
1	Seriously? Is that all you've got?
2	I thought the army was meant to be the pride of Mor Ardain?\nLooks like you need to go through basic training again!
3	You're definitely a strong fighter.\nI'll give you that.
4	I daresay even the whole garrison would\nhave trouble putting you down.
5	However.
6	The brave Imperial Army corps represent\nbut a fraction of the might of Mor Ardain.
7	The real reason that our enemies tremble before us\nis our legions of Titan weapons.
8	And the skill of those who operate them!
9	Oho!\nSo the Titan weapons make Mor Ardain's army, eh?
10	Absolutely. I believe even someone like you would\nstruggle against one.
11	Hah, is that right? Well then.
12	If the captain says so, then, uh, I guess it must be true.
13	So! How about we go and...test your theory?
14	Test?
15	A full-on demonstration of skill!
16	Huh?!
17	Huh?!
18	Yeah! Don't act all surprised!
19	You're saying that you think you can beat me\nwith one of those Titan weapons, right?
20	So I'm saying I accept your challenge!
21	No no no, come on!\nThat's a Superheavy-class weapon!
22	There's no way a single Blade can defeat it.
23	He's right, Newt.\nDon't you think you're being a bit...reckless?
24	No need to worry, Master Rex! Maybe you should\nbe worrying about the Titan I'm about to crush!
25	But...
26	Enough talk! Make your preparations, Captain!\nI'm as ready as I'll ever be!
27	Y-you're serious?\nI'm not taking responsibility if the Titan pounds you into dust!
28	Heheh. That's fine by me.\nI say, bring it on! Come on, give me all you've got!
29	...Prepare to attack.
30	Uh, sir, are you sure, sir?
31	What? Is there a problem?\nI haven't got all day!
32	W-we have no idea what could happen...
33	Come at me!
34	Not bad, eh?
35	These Titan weapons that you all value so much might be\nat the core of the Ardainian Imperial Army's strength...
36	But you shouldn't be relying on them so much.\nIt'll just end up holding you back.
37	When we fought before, I saw it very clearly.
38	The way you insist on relying on these weapons\nis making you slack off in your training.
39	If you don't keep improving, the rest\nof the world is going to catch up to you!
40	Indeed.\nConstant improvement is essential.
41	Grand Marshal!
42	*gasp* The Grand Marshal?\nWhat is he doing here?
43	Who?
44	Commander of the entire army. He reports\ndirectly to His Majesty the Emperor.
45	Brawling in a military facility? Unauthorized discharge\nof Titan weaponry? DESTRUCTION of a Titan?!
46	These are serious infractions!
47	Ugh! Forgive me, Grand Marshal!
48	We're so sorry!
49	Permission to speak, Grand Marshal?
50	This was due to my lapse in judgment.\nThere is no need to punish them.
51	I take full responsibility for what happened.
52	Lady Mòrag!
53	You keep strange company these days, my lady.
54	But respect for the free will of one's Blade is\nthe mark of a truly excellent Driver.
55	You honor me, Grand Marshal.
56	However, a crime is a crime.\nIt wouldn't do to let this go unpunished.
57	So they must work off their debt.
58	I order you to repair the Titan Archelon.\nI want it in working order as soon as possible.
59	This is top priority.
60	Um... Grand Marshal!\nCan I offer a suggestion?
61	Speak.
62	Everything that happened today...\nIt was all my fault.
63	The responsibility for repairing\nthe Titan should fall on me alone.
64	Oh, I wonder...\nWhat say you, Lady Mòrag?
65	If it pleases the Grand Marshal.\nWe will lend assistance if necessary.
66	Very well.\nThen, to work!
67	Hup!
68	Yessir, Grand Marshal, sir!\nI'll get to work fixing Archelon immediately!
69	If you'll excuse me...
qst201704_ms.json
1	Excuse me, Grand Marshal! I've come\nto make a report about my repairs!
2	My apologies, Newt, but the report\nwill have to wait.
3	You look troubled, Grand Marshal.\nIs there some problem?
4	Yes. It appears that a couple of\nShip-Eating Taos have taken up\nresidence on the Titan Warship's wings.
5	So at present I am pressed to\nfind a solution to this infestation.
6	Ship-Eating Taos?!
7	What the hell?!\nWe gotta go drive them away!
8	I know.\nWe haven't just been standing around\nwaiting for them to leave.
9	But the monsters are proving stronger\nthan we anticipated and we're a\nlittle stumped as to how to proceed.
10	Hmm.
11	Grand Marshal!\nPermission to make a suggestion?
12	Go on, Newt.
13	Would you allow me to take\ncare of the Ship-Eating Taos?
14	You?
15	I'm doubtful that even one such\nas you could take on a brace of\nShip-Eating Taos...
16	But if we don't do something about\nthem, who knows what could happen.
17	They could cause serious damage to\nthe ship if left unchecked!
18	So just let me at 'em!
19	Have you learned nothing, Newt?!
20	Grand Marshal. Will you entrust\nthis task to us?
21	Mòrag...\nPerhaps. But...
22	It's all good, pal.
23	Newt's power is unparalleled.
24	Besides, she's got Thunderbolt Zeke\nand the Flamebringer at her side.
25	This should be more than enough\nto flush out a couple of vermin.
26	Very well.\nGood luck.
qst201705_ms.json
1	The Ship-Eating Taos have taken up\nresidence on this Titan warship.
2	Please act carefully so as not\nto damage the ship itself.
3	Is this the first time you will have\nvisited Hardhaigh Palace, Newt?
4	It will be fine, as long as you make sure\nto behave. And watch your manners\nin front of His Majesty!
qst201706_ms.json
1	Newt, reporting in!
2	We successfully cleared out the\nShip-Eating Taos from the Titan\nwarship!
3	...You're safe.\nThank you for your effort.
4	Hah, no problem, Grand Marshal!
5	However, understand that if you were\na soldier, acting without orders as you\ndid would absolutely not be tolerated.
6	See that this kind of mess does not\nhappen again.
7	Uh, sir, yes sir!
8	Thank you for your lenience,\nGrand Marshal.
9	Well, your friend here did help us with\nthose Ship-Eating Taos.
10	Allow me to express my thanks.
11	I remember the days when the military\nwas full of firecrackers like her!
12	Of course, there were problems, but at\nleast they had a little vim and vigor!\nThat's who you want at your side, eh?
13	I fear the army has grown a little\nstaid in its old age, as must we all.
14	As you say, Grand Marshal.
15	That reminds me. Newt, could I\ntrouble you for a further favor?
16	Yessir!\nAll you have to do is ask, sir!
17	I must go and inform His Majesty the\nEmperor about your accomplishment.
18	Since it was, after all, YOUR\naccomplishment, I would be delighted\nif you met us at the palace.
19	R-really?
20	Meeting the Emperor...\nI-I'm not really sure I-
21	Just accept, Newt.\nThis is a great honor.
22	Thank you very much!
23	I'm rather curious to see what happens.
24	Newt loves the Ardainian Army so\nmuch. Do you think she'll cry when\nshe meets the Emperor?
25	Perhaps this is a good opportunity\nfor Newt to learn an imperial\nsoldier's manners and courtesy.
26	Well, it seems the Lady Mòrag\nhas no objection.
27	So it's decided. Newt, you will\nmake the report about your\ntriumph over the Ship-Eating Taos.
28	Yessir!\nLeave it to me sir!
qst201707_ms.json
1	Um...\nHey, everybody... Could you wait\nup just a moment?
2	What's wrong?\nYour face is a strange color.
3	Did Newt eat something bad? Worms\nfrom ground look tasty but they not.
4	N-no, I didn't do anything like that!\nDon't assume everyone is like you!
5	So what's up?
6	I know that meeting the Emperor\nis, like, a huge deal.
7	But I'm feeling all this pressure\nto not screw it up even a little bit.
8	Nervous, are we?
9	You know, Newt, even you\ncan be adorable sometimes.
10	A-adorable?!
11	What's that supposed to mean?\nQuit making fun of me!
12	Special Inquisitor Mòrag!\nExcuse me!
13	A messenger.\nWhat news?
14	His Majesty the Emperor is\nbusy with training.
15	He begs your forgiveness but your\naudience is canceled.
16	?!
17	So you're saying we don't\nget to meet the Emperor?
18	That's right.\nMaybe some other day.
19	Oh. Well, that's a shame...\nI'm pretty disappointed.
20	Excuse me - are you Newt?
21	Who, me? Yes, so what?
22	I thought so!
23	Word of your military prowess\nhas reached Hardhaigh Palace.
24	Could I perhaps trouble you for\na handshake? Don't break my hand!
25	A handshake?\nSure thing, I guess...
26	Thank you!
27	I can't believe I shook the hand of\nthe famous Newt!
28	Ho there, do I get a handshake?
29	Me too!
30	I've heard all about you! They say\nyou're the strongest Blade there is!
31	The whole army's in awe of you!
32	R-really?\nThe...whole army?
33	Ahh you're gonna make me blush!\nAhahaha!
34	Form an orderly queue for handshakes!
35	So, um...\nIf you like, Newt, you could join\nus on our training exercises.
36	You'd want me to join you?
37	Yes! Morale would shoot through the\nroof if everyone heard you were\ntaking part!
38	But, um, I'm just a Blade, you know...
39	That's no reason to refuse.
40	I reckon it would be good practice\nfor all of us. Why don't we all do it?
41	Really?
42	All right then! I'll set things up.
43	Go talk to Navarre in the Nharil Central\nPlaza and he'll give you the lowdown.
44	Got it!
qst201708_ms.json
1	This is where we were told to go\nto find out about the training maneuver.
2	Newt! Sorry to keep you waiting!
3	The men are very excited to\nhave you joining us today!
4	Seems like a pretty large-scale thing.
5	That's right. Today we're running\na simulated invasion of Hardhaigh\nPalace by hostile forces.
6	More than half the garrison here are\ntaking part. It's not a small operation.
7	Intense. You don't see this kind\nof thing every day.
8	You lot will be on the hostile side.\nYou'll be gunning for the Emperor.
9	So what do we have to do exactly?
10	Your job is to scout the city's defenses\nand try to break into the palace.
11	Intercept His Majesty the Emperor\nand try to take him down.
12	T-take down the Emperor?
13	Got it.\nWe're the bad guys.
14	Playing the part of the enemy\nsounds like it could be an\neye-opening experience for us.
15	Our ultimate goal is to take down the\nEmperor, then... Well, I suppose that's\none way to get to meet him!
16	Woo! I'm all fired up now!
17	We'll be attempting to neutralize\nyour incursion at all costs.
18	You won't find it easy to get\nclose to His Majesty.
19	I wouldn't want anything less.\nNo holding back, yeah?
20	We'll be starting the exercise\nin just a moment.
21	Are you all set?
22	Ready as we'll ever be!
23	Can you give us just a moment?
24	Understood!\nThen let's get this show on the road!
25	Understood.\nThe scheduled start time is fast\napproaching. Please make haste.
26	Hello there, Newt!\nHow's the prep coming along?
27	Ready to get started?
qst201709_ms.json
1	What is happening here?
2	What the hell?\nDon't tell me the training exercise is still going on.
3	I get it, I get it.
4	I seem to remember we weren't the\nonly ones playing the bad guys, right?
5	I'm sorry to ruin your fun everybody,\nbut we have already secured this area!
6	The training exercise is over.
7	Huh?! Just calm down a bit and look at us,\nwill you? Hello! We're on the same team!
8	Um, Newt, it looks like these blighters\naren't playing around...
9	I can see that...
10	These thugs must be hoping to take advantage of the\ntraining exercise to try and assassinate the Emperor then?
11	Doesn't look like they wanna talk,\nbut that's where my money is!
12	We can't let them lay a finger on His Majesty!
13	Obviously!
14	I may be only one Blade...
15	But you'd have to cut off all four of my arms before\nI let His Majesty the Emperor come to any harm!
qst201710_ms.json
1	Emperor Niall!
2	Looks like we reached the goal.
3	Greetings. Are you Newt?
4	Yes, Your Majesty!\nBut h-how do you know who I am?
5	A little bird told me. I hear you are\nrather a loose cannon, though powerful.
6	Th-thank you very much!\nI'm honored, Your Majesty!
7	...I'm not sure that was as much\nof a compliment as you think.
8	That you could so easily penetrate\nour defenses...
9	I must confess that, as the ruler of the\nEmpire, I have mixed feelings about it.
10	Please don't worry, Your Majesty!
11	The Ardainian soldiers\nwere no pushovers.
12	Is that so?
13	I shall take your word for it\nand fret no more.
qst201711_ms.json
1	Your Majesty!\nAre you all right? No injuries?
2	Yes. I am unharmed.\nEveryone else?
3	All good!\nEveryone's fine.
4	That is good.
5	Though now our attention must\nturn to how our enemies managed\nto infiltrate the training maneuver.
6	It raises troubling questions\nthat must be answered.
7	The imperial capital's defenses\nmust be reviewed and reconsidered.
8	Ah! Can I help? I'm not sure\nif I'd be any use, though...
9	Thank you for the offer.
10	You are very generous.
11	I wish I could do more!
12	I'm just doing what anyone would do.
13	If I could perhaps ask you to\nrefrain from behaving quite\nas recklessly in future.
14	Wh-what do you mean?
15	Did I do something wrong?
16	Not as such.
17	But if you continue barreling\nheadlong through life as you are,\nand the unthinkable happened...
18	There are many who would\nmourn your loss. Do not forget it.
19	Your Majesty...
20	Please hold your own life in the\nsame high regard as the lives of\nthose you seek to rescue.
21	I-I will!
22	I'll carve your words\nonto my Core Crystal!
23	I pledge my allegiance to the Emperor!
24	Shouldn't you be pledging\nallegiance to your Driver?!
25	I'll pretend you said "to my Driver".
26	I'd rather you pledged allegiance\nto your Driver...
27	If you're pledging allegiance to anyone,\nshouldn't it be your Driver?
28	Huh?\nOh, uh...\nI mean...
29	Of course I pledge allegiance to\nmy Driver...but ALSO the Emperor.
30	Just don't ask me to choose\nwho gets to be ranked higher...
31	Because, um, I mean...er...\nIt's a tie! I can't decide!
32	Ha ha!\nCheeky so-and-so.\nThough that's our Newt all over!
33	Pfft.\nCheeky beggar.\nThough that's our Newt all over.
34	Hmph.\nThat's just you all over, Newt!
35	Wahaha! Cheeky blighter!\nThat's Newt all over!
36	Me all over...?\nWhat's that supposed to mean?
37	Hehehe.
38	Now even the Emperor is laughing!\nKnock it off, you guys!
qst201712_ms.json
1	OK, I see. Looks like there\nare two damaged areas.
2	If I replace those parts then\neverything should be shipshape.
3	What parts do you need?
4	A Search Monitor and a Delta Vessel.
5	Pretty sure you can get\nboth of those by salvaging.
6	Sounds like my time to shine!\nI'll be back with those things in no time!
7	Thanks!
qst201713_ms.json
1	Put this here...\nTwist that...
2	All fixed!
3	Well done, Newt!
4	It wasn't all me. I couldn't have\ndone it without your help, Rex!
5	Thank you so much!
6	Oh, give over. When your friends need\nhelp, you help them. That's just how\nit goes, you know?
7	Anyway, now that you've finished\nwe should go and report to the\nGrand Marshal.
8	You're right!\nLet's go find the Grand Marshal!
qst201801_ms.json
1	Would you look at that!
2	There's a bunch of 'em...\nMaybe we should come again later.
3	It may be wise...\nOtherwise the hunters may become the fodder...
4	It's fine!
5	No need to worry.\nI'll talk to 'em, I'm sure they'll listen to reason!
6	I mean, you say "sure," but...\nYou've not exactly got a great track record, you know?
7	Come on, every fox has its day!\nIsn't that right, Nim?
8	Very right!\nYou can leave this to me!
9	Ooh, don't be afraid.\nAuntie Nim is your friend!
10	Now... Mind telling me\nwhere your leader is?
11	Ah! Gotcha!
12	Um, could I please have a moment of your time...?
13	We've just come to rescue some of our friends.
14	They're little Phonexes, a bit smaller than you,\nand super-super cute.
15	They mustered all their courage to come here!\nDoes that ring any bells?
16	No, not "food"! "PHO-NEX"!
17	D'you think she's getting through at all?
18	Who can tell...?\nSeems to be upsetting them if I'm honest...
19	Oh, so you're gonna play dumb, huh?
20	Well, you are not fooling me!\nGive back the Phonexes, right now!
21	Ohhh, come onnnn!\nWhy won't you listennn?!
22	Nim, it's no use!\nGet out of there!
23	Aaaaaah!
24	Nim! Are you OK?
25	I was just trying to talk!\nThat really flipping hurt!
26	What's the harm in a little talking?\nWhy's it always fight-fight-fight with you...
27	Just talk to me, Architect darn you!!!
28	There! Tit for tat!\nNow we're even, see?
29	That sounds like...\nfailure to communicate, doesn't it?
30	Indeed. Unfortunately, it seems\nwe're not getting out of this without a fight...
31	Onwards!
qst201802_ms.json
1	We're here now!\nEveryone's back, safe and sound!
2	Hey, come on, give us some space.\nI can't breathe with all of you here like this...
3	They look pretty happy.
4	Why Phonexes make such racket though?
5	Huh...\nYeah, I wonder.
6	Excuse me...
7	What can I do for you, Nim?
8	It's, ah...
9	These nice Phonex folks are saying that they\nwant to hear our tales of adventure.
10	Hah...\nTales of adventure, eh?
11	It was a bit of an ordeal, wasn't it?\nI say, let's let 'em hear it!
12	All right!
13	So then we roll up to the\nplace where the monsters were like, ta-daa!
14	And what do we see,\nif not a big, angry-looking strong one!
15	But I had a conversation with it first!\nI conversed and conversed and conversed!
16	Uh, "conversation" implies both sides talking...?\nWhat you did there was more of a monologue...
17	That right! Nim very confident in talking,\nbut in the end nothing come out of it.
18	N-no, you got it all wrong...
19	It's just the monster had a short fuse\nand didn't want to engage in meaningful dialog...
20	If it was any other monster, I'm sure\nI could've convinced it!
21	Oh, I'm sure...
22	Grr!\nStop laughing!
23	Anyway, the monster suddenly\ngave me a headbutt,
24	and it hurt so much I started crying!
25	There's no talking to a brute like that...
26	But didn't you sock him right back\nafter that?
27	Yeah, you did!
28	You hit 'im so hard, all the other monsters\nwinced at seeing it!
29	Yeah, that was awesome!\nGood technique, right there.
30	Y-yeah, well, right then my feelings were hurt too,\nand I lost my cool...
31	Kit and Sunny tried to talk sense,\nbut I didn't think and just went all out!
32	So then what, then what?
33	So then we went to town on those ruffians.
34	Boom! Pow!\nYeah, we got 'em good.
35	Great win for Team Nim!
36	Then we found and rescued this\nrag-tag band of Phonex heroes!
37	Oh?\nWhat wrong?
38	The denouement come too easily,\nTora disappointed by poor plot pacing.
39	Sorry, um...
40	This Phonex and his friends are saying\n*I'm* the true hero...
41	True hero?
42	Well, since I went and saved them...\nThey're calling that the birth of a true hero...
43	...What do I do?
44	Bwahaha!
45	True hero... It's got a nice ring to it!
46	But I haven't even done anything!\nI don't deserve to be called...a true hero...
47	That's not true, is it?
48	You put your body on the line to save\nall these little lives, Nim.
49	Yeah, that's right.
50	You took a problem we didn't even realize existed,\nand resolved it quickly and efficiently.
51	You make a great hero, Nim.
52	I...do...don't I...?
53	Heheheh! ...Oh.\nMaybe I shouldn't gloat, but this makes me super happy!
54	Maybe you couldn't talk to the monsters,\nbut the Phonexes definitely appreciate you trying!
55	Woo!
qst201803_ms.json
1	I don't feel like talking to you!\nStay back, I say!
2	Pex has gone off to Uraya.
3	Relax, I wouldn't lie to you!\nI mean, you did give me Pinfins!
qst201804_ms.json
1	What, you again? I toldja, I've got\nnothing to say to you.
2	I'm sorry for intruding so suddenly!
3	Here, I brought you a little something.\nYou like these, right?
4	Yoho, Pinfins!
5	They're not...poisoned, are they...?
6	I'm hurt! I would never!\nRelax and just dig in!
7	Hm. Well, in that case...
8	Hey, all'a y'all!\nThey're giving out Pinfins here!
9	Ahh... *burp*\nThat was tasty.\nI'm so full.
10	You're not as bad as you look, kid.
11	Well, you did all right by me with the\nPinfins, so I guess I can tell you stuff.
12	What didja want to know?
13	Well, actually, we're looking for a\nPhonex by the name of Pex...
14	Do you know anything that might help?
15	Pex! Of course I know 'im!
16	Really?!
17	Mix and Pex left the settlement\ntogether, and stayed gone for a while...
18	Then recently, Pex came back on 'is\nown. Well, he seemed happy enough,\nso I didn't think too much about it.
19	And where might Pex be now...?
20	Ahh, he gathered some more pals and\nthey left, sayin' they'd go to another\ncountry or whatever.
21	Do you know why?\nDid someone think to ask?
22	He did mention he was lookin' for\nstrong companions, quote unquote,\nbut that's all I know.
23	Someone said they'd boarded a boat\nto Uraya, so, uh...
24	It might be an idea to hit up the\nPhonexes over there?
25	Uraya?\nNot Mor Ardain?
26	No, I'm pretty sure it was Uraya.
27	Huh... I could've bet it would be\nMor Ardain...
28	...Why so disappointed?
29	No way!\nWait, what if...!
30	They may have gotten targeted by\nthe Ardainians after they landed!
31	...This conversation jump too much\nfor Tora to follow.
32	That has to be it!\nQuickly, we have to go save them!
33	Nim, you have to chill out.\nI think you're letting your mind\nrun away with you...
34	No, but you see? It could be too late!
35	Everyone!\nWe have to get to Uraya, ASAP!
36	Let's find the Phonex community there\nand ask them what's what!
qst201805_ms.json
1	Everyone, look!
2	That's the Urayan Phonex village!
3	Quick, let's go talk to them!
4	Hey, hey, back up there.\nIf we go empty-handed, won't they just\ntell us to get lost, like last time?
5	Ah, you're right!\nWe need to get ready with gifts!
6	...OK then, we'll look for whatever\nthese Phonexes like.
7	You can't get Pinfins around here,\nso it'll have to be something else...
qst201806_ms.json
1	You have no business here, humans!\nGo away!
2	And no ravaging our village, either!
3	Thanks for the Cobalt Eels! Yum!
4	If you're looking for Pex, he'd said\nhe was going to Temperantia, see?
qst201807_ms.json
1	Stuff we like?
2	Yeah, OK, hm...\nI'd have to say Cobalt Eel!
3	I don't think you'd find a single Phonex\nin Uraya who could resist 'em!
4	You'll understand if you try one, I think.
5	Hm, Pex? Nah, I don't know\na Phonex by that name.
6	But there's a Phonex village in the\nCrown of Sanctuary. Someone there\nmight've heard something.
qst201808_ms.json
1	Hi there!\nMind if I bend your ear a minute?
2	Are they Cobalt Eels?!\nCan I have some?
3	Hold your horses, buddy,\nI wanna talk first!
4	C'mon, I'll tell you anything,\njust gimme! Gimme!
5	Oh, cut the dramatics.\nThere's plenty to go around.
6	Here, and make sure to share them\nwith everyone!
7	Yum! Nosh!\nSo darn tasty!
8	Um, right, so...
9	Ah, yes! You wanted to talk?
10	A Phonex called Pex was supposed\nto come here, to Uraya...
11	Would you mind telling us if\nyou know anything?
12	Ah, the guy from Leftheria?
13	So you do know something!
14	Sure thing! Crossing the Cloud Sea\nwith no regard for the risks involved\ntakes a special kind of courage.
15	Kids like him surely deserve\nto be called heroes!
16	Do you know where Pex is now?
17	Ah, see, I'd thought he was just talking\nto his friends, but then he goes and\ndeclares he's going to Temperantia.
18	Kept talking about looking for\nhardened companions for a bit,\nthen off he went, some kids in tow.
19	Temperantia?!
20	If I recall, weren't there Ardainian\ntroops stationed in Temperantia?
21	Yes, that is correct...
22	That's bad!\nThat's really very bad!
23	If Ardainians catch them, they might\neat them, or worse yet, skin them!
24	We must hurry to their rescue!
25	...Nim, you're exaggerating again.
26	Please, relax. The Ardainian Armed\nForces pose no threat to Phonexes.
27	You can't know that!
28	This is Ardainians we're talking about!\nArchitect only knows what they'll do!
29	We have to go, now! Let's move!
qst201809_ms.json
1	Lookit that, Nim.\nA Phonex village, in a place like this.
2	It definitely looks like they're living\nhappy, peaceful lives here...
3	So I don't think I need to say it,\nbut...
4	Yes!\nPeace offerings!
5	I wonder what their local delicacy\nmight be...
6	I'd suggest less wondering and more\nasking around, but that's just me...
qst201810_ms.json
1	...What do you think you're doing,\ncoming here uninvited?
2	This isn't a place for humans.\nHurry up and get lost.
3	The Vacillus Antol has gone\nin the direction of the Ruined Chapel\nof Danafas.
4	Please, I hope you'll take care\nof my friends.
qst201811_ms.json
1	Excuse me?\nYou want to know my favorite food?
2	Hm. Well, the tastiest thing around here\nis the Trippy Catfish.
3	I could watch it swimming for hours,\nand then it tastes sooo good, too!
4	It's all the rage with Temperantia's\nPhonex community.
5	A Phonex called Pex?\nNo, I'm sorry, I haven't a clue.
6	Our village is in Aegishammer though,\nmaybe someone there will know.
qst201812_ms.json
1	Um, hello?
2	Hmph.
3	...Um, I've got something for you...\nWould you tell the others?
4	Bah.
5	Oh, you not like them?
6	Ah, you're a wary one, aren't you?
7	OK, so you don't want them?\nI'm telling you, they're delicious...
8	Fine, I'll eat them if you don't want to...
9	Wait, wait!\nDon't eat them!
10	Haha!\nNow you feel like talking?
11	...Mhm. It actually was tasty.
12	But I ask myself, what ulterior motive\ndid you have to bring us such a gift?
13	Well, about that.\nI'm looking for a particular Phonex...
14	...Looking for a Phonex?\nDo you mean Pex?
15	You know him?!
16	Sure I do. It's not every day we get\nvisitors from abroad... Really, he's\na proper hero, so he is.
17	Can you tell me where he is now?
18	...Unfortunately, he's gone.
19	Gone?! You mean, like,\ngone to another country still?!
20	Ah, no, not like that.
21	He'd gathered a bunch of young folk\nnearby and was talking to 'em\nabout something, when...
22	all of a sudden, a Vacillus Antol\ncame and took 'em all captive!
23	Say what now?!\nWhy didn't someone do something?!
24	We wanted to, but we're talking about\na monstrous monster here.
25	If Pex, a real hero, couldn't do a thing,\nthen what hope do we have?
26	I bet they're all spider food by now...
27	We'd probably best resign ourselves\nto the inevitable.
28	I won't allow it!
29	You can't give in to despair!
30	We might still make it in time!\nWe won't know till we try!
31	Tell me where the Vacillus Antol\nhas its lair!
32	It... It went off towards\nthe Ruined Chapel of Danafas...
33	That's probably where its nest is.
34	Got it!
35	It'll be OK! I, Nim, will save everyone\nand bring them to safety!
36	Friends, lend me your strength!\nThe fight for Pex's life begins now!
qst201813_ms.json
1	Pex... Where could you be...?
2	Uh, hi? Hello?\nYou look kinda forlorn...\nDid something happen?
3	Yeeeek?!\nYou can understand me?
4	Yes!\nYes, I can.
5	...Hm, yes, I can see you're different\nfrom other people...
6	You might actually be more like us!
7	All you need to know is that you can\ntell me about anything that's bothering\nyou.
8	...Well, OK then. You see, I have\nthis childhood friend named Pex.
9	However, he went off some time ago\nand has yet to come back.
10	He doesn't seem to be in the village,\nand I can't very well go off looking for\nhim myself...
11	I'm worried he might've gotten\nwrapped up in some bad stuff.
12	Yes, it makes sense!\nDon't worry, Nim'll sort it out!
13	Really?!
14	Absolutely! Just leave it to me!
15	I bet I know what happened.
16	I'm sure Pex has been\ntaken away by Ardainians!
17	What?!
18	Yeah, it's clear as day. Have you seen\nthe weird gizmos they put on Titans?\nArdainians can't possibly be good guys!
19	But don't worry, I'll make things right!
20	But... We haven't seen any Ardainians\naround, so it seems pretty unlikely...
21	No, I'm dead certain!
22	Poor little Pex... He must be so afraid,\nshivering and alone somewhere!
23	Mix, you wait here!
24	Y-yes, OK...\nI can count on you, then?
25	That's all well and good, but we\ncan't just go off blindly.
26	Maybe someone'll know something...
27	I suggest you visit our village, then.
28	Pex might have passed through there\nat some point...
29	There's a Phonex village?
30	Yes! It's in Ysheva Harbor.\nThat's where Pex and I were born.
31	Would you be able to show us the way?
32	I'd love to, but, uh, that's...
33	Really scary monsters appear on the\nroad to the village sometimes.
34	They even went after me once...
35	I've been afraid to go back, frankly.\nI'd rather just hang out here.
36	That's so terrible...
37	Anyway, I'm on it.
38	Ysheva Harbor you said, right?\nWe'll go ask around!
39	Thank you so much!\nPex's life is in your hands...
qst201814_ms.json
1	Are you all right?!
2	You've come to help?\nAbout time...
3	Yeah, any longer and we'd have been\neaten!
4	Thank you!
5	No thanks are needed!\nI'm just glad you're all safe.
6	Ah, I almost forgot!\nIs someone here named Pex?
7	Did you say Pex? I'm Pex...\nHow do you know my name?
8	Mix, in Fonsett Village, asked us\nto find you!
9	Mix did?!
10	That's right!\nShe's been worried sick about you!
11	Oh, that's bad...\nI never meant to worry her...
12	What's the reason you went on this\ncountry-hopping journey, Pex?
13	From what I hear, you've been visiting\nthe various Phonex communities and\ntalking to their young people?
14	I'll tell you.\nI've been gathering Phonexes-in-arms\nto eradicate monsters.
15	You want to fight monsters?
16	Yes!
17	You say you met Mix in Fonsett, right?
18	She's... Ever since she's been attacked\nby a big bad monster I call the Demon\nKing, she's been afraid to get out.
19	Because of that, she can't even get\nback to her family in the village.\nShe's been stuck for so long now.
20	I want to defeat the Demon King\nand free Mix from her isolation!
21	But I'd never manage alone...\nSo I went around the world, picking up\nstrong Phonexes to fight with me.
22	Wow, that's some story...
23	But I guess my traveling is over.\nMy mission is a success!
24	...Is that right? So I guess you've found\nwho you were looking for!
25	Well, don't be coy!\nIntroduce me!
26	Um...
27	Well? What's wrong?
28	Well, OK. The powerful ally I met\nat the end of my long and perilous\njourney...
29	That's you, Nim!
30	Won't you come back to Leftheria\nwith us and help us defeat the Demon\nKing in his lair on the Isle of Urchon?!
31	Whuh?\nMe?!
32	Hold up, hold up.\nI'm just Nim! I've not got that kinda...
33	No, come on! I've seen your blinding\nagility and your unstoppable headbutt!
34	There's no way the Demon King\ncan stand against you!
35	Uhhh, but...
36	Please!\nYou're our only hope, Nim,\nmine and Mix's!
37	...OK, I'll do it!\nI mean, we've come this far, right?\nMight as well see this thing through!
38	Leave it to me and my Driver!\nWe'll do whatever's in our power!
39	That Demon King in his lair on the Isle\nof Urchon won't know what hit him!

1	Now Mix will be able to live her life\nin peace!
2	Nim, thank you! Seriously!
3	I'll go see how Mix is doing!
4	We'll head back to our village in\nYsheva Harbor after that,\nso please come and find us!
5	We'll make sure to give you a\nsuitable reward! You'll come, right?
qst201817_ms.json
1	That must be the Phonex village\nthat Mix told us about.
2	There's nothing else here that'd\nmatch the description... I'd say\nthat's it.
3	What're we waiting for, then?\nLet's go ask that Phonex for\nany relevant information!
qst201818_ms.json
1	ありがとう！
2	助かったよ！
qst201819_ms.json
1	I think it's so cool you can talk to\nPhonexes, Nim! I can't tell you how\njealous I am...
2	Man, I wish I could talk to Phonexes...\nI'm jealous, Nim!
3	I would very much like to speak with\na Phonex one day. I envy you, Nim.
4	Man, why can't I talk to Phonexes...?\nI've got serious envy right now, Nim!
5	Is that right?\nWe don't really talk about\nanything special, though.
6	Just day-to-day stuff,\nor what's good to eat...
7	Pretty much the same stuff everyone\ntalks about, you know?
8	But if you really insist, Rex...
9	But if you really insist, Nia...
10	But if you really insist, Zeke...
11	But if you really insist, Mòrag...
12	I can teach you some Phonex!\nHow about that?
13	Really?\nYes please!
14	Are you serious?\nNo backsies, yeah?
15	That is a welcome offer.\nI will take you up on it when\nthere is time to spare.
16	What, seriously?\nThis is my lucky day!
17	Yes!\nIt'll be our little project, Rex!
18	Yes!\nIt'll be our little project, Nia!
19	Yes!\nIt'll be our little project, Zeke!
20	Yes!\nIt'll be our little project, Mòrag!
qst201820_ms.json
1	The Phonex village is\nin Ysheva Harbor.
2	Please help Pex. Please!
3	All Phonexes love Pinfins. It's a fact!
4	They've got pins all over, actually,\nso they're a bit hard to eat, but the\ntaste! Incomparable!
5	I wonder where Pex is...\nI hope he's all right...
6	I'm so glad Pex is back safe...
7	Oh, do you still have business to finish?\nWell, get back quick then!
qst201821_ms.json
1	Hello, little Phonex!\nI've got some questions for y-
2	Choke on a bone, human!\nI ain't talkin' to the likes of you!
3	Hey, come on, don't be like that...\nIt's an emergency, you know!
4	Look, it won't take a minute.\nWon't you please talk to me?
5	No, I won't. Don't trust humans.\nKeep walkin', sunshine!
6	Man, what a grouch...\nHe wouldn't even listen!
7	How about we go back to Mix,\nsee if she knows of a solution?
8	She might give us a clue\nabout the right approach here.
9	That's a good idea.\nLet's do it!
qst201822_ms.json
1	So you met Gox but he\nwouldn't talk to you at all?
2	No, he wasn't being\neven slightly helpful.
3	Huh, OK, so he chased you away...
4	Well, it's not unheard of. Us Phonexes\nare usually wary of strangers, after all.
5	It's not easy to earn our trust.\nEspecially when it comes to humans\nor Blades...
6	Is that right...?\nNot even poor old me...
7	Oh, but don't get down in the dumps.\nYou should be fine if you just bring\nhim something to eat.
8	Phonexes like Pinfins a whole lot!
9	If you give him that,\nI'm sure his mood'll improve greatly!
10	I see! So food is the key!\nWhy didn't I think of that?!
11	Thanks for the advice!
12	OK team, let's go track down\nsome of that thing that Phonexes like!
qst201823_ms.json
1	You kept us waiting, Nim!
2	Thanks for everything!
3	Mix! You made it!
4	Yes, thanks to you.
5	Some days I thought\nI'd never make it home again...
6	I can't tell you how happy I am!\nAnd how grateful, to Pex and you both!
7	No way, no way...\nI didn't do anything special!
8	Hey, let's not talk out here.\nCome on, you're welcome inside!
9	We should celebrate this, this...\nthis combination homecoming slash\nheroic triumph!
qst201901_ms.json
1	You know, I almost missed being\na million miles from nowhere.
2	Sheba, why did you take us all the\nway out here?
3	Hahah! Have you no eyes in your heads, peons?
4	Behold! These magnificent white sands...\nThis crystal clear lake...
5	And the mansion at the lakeside...\nWhat better place for the perfect vacation?
6	Is this not the summer paradise that you longed for?! The dream\nisland destination that makes you the envy of your peers?!
7	Wait... Wh-wh-wh-why is there absolutely nothing here?!?!
8	And...to...think...
9	It cost us a million gold to become\nthe owner of this island...
10	A million?!
11	You mean to say you BOUGHT\nthis island?!
12	We saved up the money over a long period of time...
13	We had intended to purchase an opulent mansion on a small\ncozy island. And then...
14	We would gather the loveliest women from around\nthe world to our paradise...
15	Eat, drink and be merry...\nIt was our dream come true...
16	What are we to do with this dinky, dreary, desolate\nexcuse for a landmass...
17	Looks like you've been had.
18	Yep yep. It clear that Sheba tricked!
19	You are indeed correct.\nWe have been well and truly deceived.
20	That Ardainian black-feathered fool...\nHe robbed us of our money and made off with it!
21	Black-feathered fool?
22	Could it have been a Nopon merchant?
23	I see. It seems you can identify the perpetrator.
24	That makes things simple.
25	Right! All we've gotta do is get\nthe money back from them!
26	Come on, cheer up!
27	Nia, Mòrag, Brighid...
28	You will lend us your aid?
29	Goes without saying really.
30	If we leave this merchant to his own devices,\nthere are sure to be more victims.
31	We should get this over with as quickly as possible.
32	Ohh, our beloved friends...
33	You alone would treat us with such kindness...
34	As proof of our gratitude, let us welcome you into\nthe uppermost echelons of our entourage!
35	...Nah, you're all right there.
36	Indeed... I don't think I'm befitting\nof such a position.
37	Agreed. It's the thought that counts.
38	'Tis a shame, truly.
39	But it matters not.\nThat impudent, feathered fool, on the other hand...!
40	How dare that dirty, dopey-looking creature\ntoy with our delicate feelings!
41	Justice will be served, we swear!
42	Come, beloved friends! Let us make\nfor Alba Cavanich, the imperial capital!
43	Ah, peons and beasts may carry the luggage.
44	We expect you to pull your weight!
45	Excuse me?!
qst201902_ms.json
1	The boutique of that black-feathered\nfool should be in this general- Oh...?
2	Seems like there's a problem.\nI wonder what's up?
3	Indeed. We shall enquire as to the\nnature of their predicament.
4	What is the matter? We cannot help\nbut note that you seem beleaguered.
5	May we assist you?
6	Oh, thank you. Well, we were hoping\nto claim back some money from\na Nopon...
7	You too have fallen foul of the\nfeathered felon? Speak.
8	All right...
9	There's a Nopon merchant around here\ncalled Saisai. He said he knew a quick,\neasy way to turn 1,000G into 10,000.
10	He asked me if I was on board. Said it\nwouldn't take more than a few days.
11	I gave him the money. Some days\npassed, but I still hadn't heard back.
12	That didn't seem right, so I went to\nthe shop to see what was up, but there\nwas no one in.
13	When I asked around, I discovered that\nSaisai had closed down his shop and\npacked up a few days earlier.
14	So now I'm at a loss...
15	I won't be able to afford food for my\ndaughter at this rate. I just don't know\nwhat we should do now...
16	Looks like they fell for a scam. They\ntook the money and ran...
17	That good-for-nothing!
18	Not content with conning us, now he's\nwilling to trick an innocent mother\nand child just to line his pocket?!
19	Whether the law permit, such a vile\ndeed as this shall not go unpunished!
20	Rex! Relinquish 10,000G to this poor\nwoman at once!
21	Huh?
22	Why me?!
23	Why do you look so surprised?
24	Ultimately, we will wrest back our\nmillion from that ne'er-do-well.
25	A paltry sum such as this will hardly\nbreak the bank now, will it?
26	Uh, sure, but isn't 10,000 a bit much?\n1,000G would be enough, wouldn't it?
27	Imbecile! We took you to be a man\nlarge of heart! Show some compassion!
28	Hey, come on!
qst201903_ms.json
1	Obey Sheba and hand over 10,000G?
2	Hand it over
3	Don't hand it over
4	Ah, we'll get by somehow. Don't\nworry about us...
qst201904_ms.json
1	This...this much?!\nAre you sure about this?
2	Take it.
3	It is our policy never to overlook a lady\nin trouble.
4	You realize I'm the one paying up\nhere...
5	Cease your whining, Rex! It is not\nbecoming of a gentleman!
6	That should suffice for the time being,\nshould it not? You may use it as you\nsee fit.
7	I...I don't know what to say...\nThank you! Thank you so much!
8	Yes... We have decided!
9	Dare I ask... What've you decided?
10	We have observed that the child\nwill one day mature into a beautiful\nbutterfly.
11	She shall be given a free pass into\nour entourage!
12	In which case, we must turn back this\ninstant, and-
13	Please, wait...
14	Maybe before all that, it important to\nsearch for Nopon that tricked Sheba?
15	Oh! You are quite right!
16	You bestow sage advice, dear Poppi!\nWe would expect nothing less of you!
17	Still, it seems we are all but groping in\nthe dark now.
18	We shall have to locate an area where\nNopon congregate and press them for\ninformation.
19	Yes! To the Argentum Guild we go!
20	There are an abundance of Nopon\nmerchants there. Surely we will find\nthe lead we seek.
21	If all goes well, we may even be able\nto meet the black-feathered villain.
22	Your monarch has spoken! We make\nfor Argentum immediately!
23	I'm not sure it'll be that easy...\nGoldmouth's a big place, you know.
24	Fear not. They are but cretins.
25	He will surely have disembarked at\nGoldmouth Return Port. We shall\nfind him skulking around there!
26	And now we depart! Follow our lead!
qst201905_ms.json
1	Mmm... We see that it is indeed\na place of spacious proportions.
2	Where might we find the black-\nfeathered fool, Tora?
3	How should Tora know?! Me not know\nwhat other Nopon doing just cause me\nalso Nopon!
4	A shame. Then we have no choice but\nto inquire based on our memory of the\nincident.
5	We do have a name, though: Saisai.
6	That and the black feathers.
7	That still not much to go on...
8	We shan't know unless we try.\nCome. Let us perambulate and\nlook for suspicious individuals.
9	Good idea to start from first floor\nfirst!
qst201906_ms.json
1	*sniff* *sob* *hic*
2	What is the matter, child?\nWhy do you cry?
3	*sniff* Umm...there was...
4	A Nopon with black feathers... It\nran into me and knocked me over...
5	And they broke my precious clam\nhairclip...
6	*sob* *sniff*
7	I got it for my birthday... Dad said it\nwas a rare treasure he got from\nsalvaging...
8	Grrrr! That scoundrel!
9	He would make a little girl cry?\nFoul beast! Lowest of the low!
10	Fear not, child. We will deal with this\nmatter forthwith.
11	And while we may not be able to\nrecover your precious hair ornament,\nwe will find you a replacement.
12	R-really?
13	Really. Not a lie ever escapes our lips!
14	Hey, Sheba, the Nopon this girl\nbumped into... It could be the one\nwe're after, Saisai.
15	If we hurry, we might be able to catch\nhim for questioning.
16	Enough! While we agree that one\nmillion in gold is no small sum...
17	surely you have not forgotten our\ndream?
18	To unite the belles of the world under\na common flag...in our entourage.
19	And together we shall hold the finest\ntea parties Alrest has ever known!
20	Saving this girl is but another step\ntoward that dream!
21	So it is with the greatest of urgency\nthat we implore you to find this child\na clam hair ornament!
22	That means you, Rex!
23	Of course it does...
24	But don't worry, I think you can pick\nthem up on the Goldmouth Flight Deck.\nI'll head there right now!
qst201907_ms.json
1	Here. We have found you\na replacement.
2	Wow! It's so pretty... Thanks, lady!
3	Ohh... What an angelic little smile\nyou have...
4	What would you say to joining our\nown personal entourage?
5	Here she goes again...
6	Hey, Sheba. How about we go\nback to finding that "black-feathered"\nNopon now?
7	Ah yes, that's right. It had completely\nslipped our mind.
8	Maybe the girl can tell us some more.
9	You want to know about the black\nNopon?
10	Yes, we would. We would indeed!\nTell us everything you know!
11	Sure!
12	Well, when I bumped into him,\nhe dropped this paper. Think\nit'll help?
13	How fortuitous! Our child, your actions\nare commendable!
14	It is only natural that you be offered\na VIP seat in our entourage!
15	Seriously, stop that!
16	Can't we just read the flipping memo?
17	...As you wish.
18	Ahem! Are you ready?\nThen we shall begin.
19	"Our next meeting will take place on\ndeck of Maelstrom. Be there on dot,\nnot minute later!"
20	So it's a meeting memo?\nThat practically leads us right to them!
21	So it seems.
22	Just you wait, you black-feathered\nfool... Justice will soon be served!
qst201908_ms.json
1	W-what is this?! There is a whole flock\nof black-feathered fools?!
2	We'll never know which one's Saisai\nat this rate...
3	We shall just have to grab them one\nby one until we find the culprit!
4	Uhh, shouldn't we think this through\na bit more?
5	It matters not! All that we require now\nis to take action!
qst201909_ms.json
1	There you are, you black-feathered ingrate!
2	Who are you?!
3	First you swindle us, and now you have the gall\nto make an innocent girl cry?! Scum of Alrest!
4	Your wicked meddling ends here and now!
5	Who this woman? Why she make so much racket?
6	...Ah, I remember her!
7	She dumdum who buy desert island for 1,000,000 gold!
8	Ahahahaha! That hilarious!
9	How stupid can woman be?!
10	Hahaha...
11	Mocking an exalted figure, are you?\nYou ought to be put in your place.
12	We hope you are ready for your just deserts!
13	Desserts? We have plenty food already!
14	Nargh... What you gonna do about it?
15	Divine Punishment!
16	Now, step forward if you'd like to be a forgotten page\nin the annals of history!
17	W-wait! Calm down!
18	There important reason why we\ndo what we do!
19	There is nothing you could possibly say to allay\nour righteous anger.
20	Prepare yourselves!
21	Whoa, whoa, hold on a second, Sheba!
22	Stay out of this, Rex! Or do you wish\nto receive similar punishment?
23	But if you beat these guys up, how are\nyou going to get your money back?
24	[ML:undisp ](gasp)
25	Indeed... The peon makes a fair point!
26	We should at least listen to what\nthey've got to say.
27	You can always pummel them later, yeah?
28	Oh, well... How could we refuse advice from\nour dear friend Nia?
29	All right. We shall listen to your pitiful pleas.
30	However!
31	If we perceive even the slightest hint of foul play,\nyou know what's coming to you, yes?
32	[ML:undisp ](timorous, fearful noise)
qst201910_ms.json
1	We not in wrong! We just do what\nwe told!
2	Oh? And what, pray tell, is it that you\nwere told to do?
3	Told to bury four barrels in different\nplaces in Alrest.
4	We only bury them, so we not know\nwhat inside!
5	Interesting... Perhaps we should give\nthem credit where it's due.
6	What you mean?
7	They split the money up to avoid\nattracting attention by having a large\nsum of money in one place, I gather?
8	Exactly so, Mòrag.
9	Now, feathered ingrates! You shall\ntell us the location of these barrels!
10	OK, OK! Alala tell you now, so please\ngive some space!
11	Alala and friends buried barrels...\nNear Sauros's Bed in Gormott...
12	Near Leaning Tower of Dorrick\nin Temperantia...
13	Near Wonder Spring Plaza Ruins\nin Spirit Crucible Elpys...
14	And finally near Balquors Ruins\nat Cliffs of Morytha!
15	Well, friends, you heard the ingrate!
16	It is time to reclaim the money\nthat is rightfully ours!
qst201911_ms.json
1	Where is it?! Where's the money?!\nSpeak or suffer the consequences!
2	W-what going on?! What money?
3	The money inside the barrels!\nThat is what's going on!
4	The money you robbed us of was\nsupposed to be in the four buried\nbarrels, but it wasn't! Where is it?!
5	N-not know what you talking about...
6	Do not play dumb with us!\nWe know it was you!
7	You rotten, black-feathered wretch!
8	How long do you plan to string\nus along?!
9	Spit it out. Or we will make it so that\nyou speak no more!
10	Meh-meh-meh-meeeeeeh!!!
11	Please, forgive us!!!
12	We not know anything, really!
13	Only leader know what inside barrels!\nWe just do as we told...
14	And where, then, is this leader of\nyours, mmm?
15	Where is he?! Lay him before us this\ninstant!
16	L-leader is Saisai! You already kick him\ninto middle of next week!
17	Saisai go flying... Is mystery where he\nwent after that...
18	...
19	Ah, err... We see. That does put\na damper on the issue.
20	Get yourselves ready, all! We shall\ncommence a search for Saisai at once!
21	I don't think we should just run around\nlike headless Tirkin, though...
22	Then what would you suggest?
23	Well, how about we get the mercs\nto help us out?
24	I'm sure they'll be much faster sniffing\nout the guy than us.
qst201913_ms.json
1	There is nowhere left to run, feathered fool!
2	Repent and return that which does not belong to you!
3	We not obliged to give back one coin!\nYou the fool for being tricked!
4	Why you... Infidel!
5	Just wait a minute, Sheba!
6	Divine Punishment!
7	Meh-meh-meeeeeeeh!
8	Ahh... In our fit of anger, we...
9	No! Our gold! Our precious 1,000,000 goooold!
10	The great unwashed are lining their pockets with it...
11	You've really done it now.
12	I tried to stop you...
13	Ahh... Ahhhh...
14	Hey, lady!
15	...Hmm?
16	Here! This is yours, isn't it?
17	You... You would return this to us?
18	Yeah. Everyone needs money, don't they?
19	Oh, sweet, sweet child. Oh purest angel!
20	All of you... You do this for our sake...
21	You have...our sincerest thanks!
22	It is we who were the fools.
23	To have doubted you even for a moment...\nWe are undeserving of such honesty.
24	...Wait. You deserve a reward!
25	We shall invite you all to a magnificent tea party!
26	Really?!
27	Sounds amazing!
28	Huh?! You're gonna invite all these kids?!
29	That is correct. The money is no longer of any consequence.
30	For we have found something more precious\nthan all the world's jewels.
31	These pure, perfectly innocent children have opened our eyes.
32	We were wrong to focus solely on gathering an entourage\nand holding magnificent parties.
33	What we really should have been seeking was the\nunblemished hearts of these darling children.
34	Inviting these children to our tea party is more\nthan enough to make us happy.
35	Sheba...are you sure about this?
36	If there is one thing we are sure of, it's this.
37	Our dream remains, only redirected.
38	Well then, maybe I just might decide to\ntag along too!
39	Would you mind if I joined you as well?
40	Absolutely. The more the merrier!
41	Mmm, this is super tasty!
42	Hehehe! I've never had anything like this before!
43	It gladdens us to hear that.\nFrom the bottom of our heart!
44	Do help yourselves to tea and treats.\nIt's all there for your delectation!
45	Let us have a celebration to end all others!
46	So tell me... Why are we the ones serving\nthe food again?
47	This outrage! Tora not accept this!
48	Shush, you! Just grin and bear it!\nDon't go ruining the moment for them!
49	*sigh*
qst201914_ms.json
1	The reprobate that goes by the\nname of Saisai must be somewhere\nin this town...
2	...Mm?
3	There he is! That's him!!!
4	Saisai prepared for trouble, but never\nimagined woman would follow here...
5	Hah! We are nothing if not tenacious!
6	Now, we shall have you return the\nmoney you purloined! Every last coin!
7	Peh! Who in right mind return money\nafter petty threat like that?!
8	Woman not get single coin if she not\ncatch Saisai!
9	And anyway, most of money already\nbelong to finest Ardainian bodyguards!\nWoman have fun convincing them!
10	You filthy... You wasted the money\non this?!
11	Let us dispatch these nuisances and\ntake down the feathered fool at once!
qst201915_ms.json
1	Ah yes... We have listened to the trials\nand tribulations of these poor children.
2	And we intend to help each and\nevery one.
3	What?! How many are we talking here?
4	Uh, and how many is that gonna be?
5	Could you be more precise? How\nmany do you intend to help?
6	You wanna help all the kids here?!\nHow many will that be then?
7	We estimate somewhere in the region\nof 10.
8	But fear not. We shall also be assisting\nthem personally this time.
9	No need to be so modest. We are\na team, are we not?
10	It shall be a give-and-take relationship.\nWhat greater reward than the bond\nof friendship?
11	It is rather a lot, we know, but there\nis no need for alarm.
12	You are our Driver. We expect you\nto answer the call of duty!
qst201916_ms.json
1	Thanks to that black-haired Nopon,\nmy lovely shell hairpiece is all broken!
2	I loved that hairpiece... It was a\nbirthday present and everything...
3	My daddy said he got it from\na salvager friend.
4	He said it was so pretty,\nhe was sure it would suit me!
qst201917_ms.json
1	Alala and friends only buried barrels.\nWas special request from Saisai.
2	Alala buried one barrel near\nSauros's Bed in Gormott.
3	No can tell any other specific\nlocation though!
4	N-not because me forgot or anything!
qst201918_ms.json
1	Corala buried barrel near Leaning\nTower of Dorrick in Temperantia.
2	Surely friends not go and dig up barrel\nafter Corala go to trouble of burying?
3	Corala not happy about that...\nBut also not want to meet same fate\nas Saisai, so Corala not argue.
qst201919_ms.json
1	Badabada went to Wonder Spring\nPlaza Ruins in Spirit Crucible Elpys.
2	Not knowing anything about contents\nof barrel! Except that was quite heavy.\nProbably very valuable things inside!
qst201920_ms.json
1	Samomo love eating Samod!\nCan eat 20 Samod in one day.
2	But, um...friends want to talk about\nmore serious things, yes?
3	Samomo buried barrel near Balquors\nRuins, in Cliffs of Morytha.
4	Saw Nopon called Bidibi while Samomo\nwas there. Was very cute!
qst202001_ms.json
1	Oh my... Well, this is a bit of a sticky\nsituation, isn't it?
2	Um, can I help you?
3	Oh! Hello there!
4	You don't often see a Blade\nwandering about on her own.\nWhere's your Driver?
5	My name is Vess. As it happens,\nI'm actually a Blade.
6	Um, yeah, I literally just said that...
7	You seemed to be worrying about\nsomething. Anything we can do?
8	Yes, well...I came here to do some\nshopping, but they don't have what\nI'm looking for in stock...
9	And since Mor Ardain are regulating\nwhat gets through to Gormott...
10	there are a lot of products that don't\nmake it to the marketplace.
11	I know! Would you mind terribly picking\nout some ingredients for me?
12	I would go myself, but I don't really\nhave the luxury of straying too far.
13	Please. I'd be very grateful.
14	Sure, I don't mind. So what's this\nfancy stuff you're after?
15	Oh, I'm not sure you could call it\nfancy per se...
16	I'm looking for 5 clumps of Salty Soil,\n8 portions of Gromrice, and 5 Ruby\nMangosteens.
17	I'm always in the area, so just come\nback here when you're done.
18	Tora understand. Will be waiting here\ntoo.
qst202002_ms.json
1	Oh, hello again!
2	Mm? Visitors?
3	Indeed! These sweet people were kind\nenough to help me with the shopping. I\nthought we might treat them to a meal.
4	Eh, what the heck. Grub's better when\nyou can enjoy it in good company.\nMake yourselves at home.
5	This is Mabon, my Driver.
6	He's not the spring chicken he used\nto be, but he was once quite the\nformidable warrior, believe it or not!
7	I suppose you could call this his\nretirement home. Just don't tell\nhim that, tee hee...
8	Vess sound very happy.
9	You can tell they get on well together.
10	I'll start preparing dinner then, shall I?\nWon't be long!
11	Is there anything we can help you with?
12	Oh, well now that you mention it...
13	How about fetching us some firewood?
14	Firewood. Got it!
15	Just talk to Dward down at Saets\nLumber Co. He's always happy to\ngive us some.
16	Thank you so much for all this!
qst202003_ms.json
1	Talk to Dward down at Saets Lumber\nCo. He always gives us firewood that's\ngoing spare.
2	Thanks ever so much!
qst202004_ms.json
1	Don't suppose Vess'll notice if\nI have a quick nibble while she's\nin the kitchen...
2	Ah! Err...
3	You heard none of that! You hear?
4	They sell Bitter Choclit in Fonsa Myma.
5	But you don't see many Fruity Rice\nBalls nowadays.
6	When I was a lad, you used to\nbe able to get 'em all over\nGormott and Argentum.
7	Well, you never know, maybe\nthey'll have a resurgence once\ntrade improves.
qst202005_ms.json
1	So you're fetching firewood for Vess,\neh?
2	Tch, and here I was looking forward\nto saying hello to her...
3	Kidding, kidding. My humor's a little\non the dry side.
4	Just head over to the scrap wood pile.\nYou'll find plenty of firewood there.\nHelp yourselves.
5	Incidentally, how's the old man\nkeeping? Still his sprightly self?
6	Good to hear, good to hear.
7	I owe a lot to Mabon, way back when.
8	He's Ardainian, himself, but he moved\nhere to Torigoth of his own accord.
9	Up until recently, he was teaching\nGormotti Drivers how to handle\nthemselves.
10	But his body couldn't keep up with it.\nHell of a thing, old age.
11	Anyway, I'd better let you go. Best\nnot keep Vess waiting, eh?
qst202007_ms.json
1	We're back again!
2	Mmgh?! *cough*
3	Just waltz in unannounced, why don't you!
4	Oh, sorry...
5	It's just that Vess asked us to fetch some firewood...
6	Oh she did, did she? Well, good on you kids.\nYou can leave it over there for now.
7	Hey, what was that you were up to just now?
8	Eh? What was what?
9	Well, it seemed as if you had swallowed\nsomething in your surprise.
10	Nothing gets past you lot, does it?
11	I happened to be eating an Urayan delicacy.\nChoclit, they call it.
12	Choclit?! Is it tasty?
13	Oh, you have no idea!
14	Creamy sweetness with a note of bitter almonds,\nintermingling in perfect harmony.
15	One bite of the stuff and you'll never go back!
16	It sound so tasty, Tora already losing\nmouthwater!
17	Tora want to try it!
18	Dear oh dear...
19	Mabon, how old are you? Eating choclit in secret\nagain, like a naughty schoolchild.
20	Ah... Vess?! No, it's not what you think!
21	Haha, I don't think so.
22	How many times have I told you?\nYou mustn't eat it all at once!
23	Uh, well, you see, the thing is...
24	You know, that Vess's got quite a presence\nsometimes, doesn't she?
25	You can say that again. I'd hate to get on her bad side.
26	You can't eat so much of this stuff, or your health is\ngoing to suffer!
27	I'll take these, thank-you-very-much!
28	Aww. But... But...
29	There's no use looking at me like that.\nI'm not falling for your tricks ever again.
30	Hmph! Spoilsport.
31	Now, come on! Don't be like that. Whatever\nwill our guests think?
32	Come, everyone. Dinner is served!
33	...Are these dumplings?
34	...They are indeed dumplings.
35	Uhh...isn't there anything else?
36	...Where is rest of food?
37	Ha, I'm afraid that's all there is.
38	So we've been dumped with nothing but dumplings...
39	Correct. Just dumplings tonight.\nAfter all, they are my specialty.
40	You should try them. They're delish, really!
41	Second-best thing I ever tasted!
42	Only second-best?
43	Yeah, first one being choclit, by a mile!
44	Oh do give it a rest, Mabon. It's bad\nmanners.
45	Ah, please, feel free to tuck in.\nHelp yourselves!
46	Hrmmm...
47	This delicious!
48	Listen to Tora. It's not half bad!
49	It's seasoned with just enough salt.
qst202008_ms.json
1	Thank you. Dinner's almost ready now.
2	Would you mind asking Mabon about\nwhere to put the firewood?
3	Mabon seems awfully fidgety...
4	He hasn't asked you to go on one of\nhis choclit-grabbing errands, I hope?
5	Ah, that brings back memories...\nI used to eat these all the time.
6	You don't see much of them around\nthese days...
7	But how did you know I liked these rice\nballs?
8	Ahh, so Mabon told you...\nI see what's going on here.
9	He asked you to buy him some\nchoclit, didn't he?
10	I knew it.
11	He thought he could fool me, did he...
12	Honestly, I don't know what to do with\nthat man any more. I'll have to give him\na proper telling off.
qst202010_ms.json
1	Ohh, what a treat! This is exactly\nthe choclit I was after. Thank you\nkindly!
2	Could you deliver the rice ball\nto Vess for me? Ta.
3	I'm sure she'll be pleased with it.
4	ムスビは家の周りにおるはずじゃ\nおはぎを渡してやってくれ
5	もぐもぐ
6	スペルビアのどこかに隠したと\n思ったんじゃがな
7	確か、引き潮のときにしか\nいけない場所だったような
8	息子はスペルビアに\n娘はインヴィディアにおるんじゃ
9	おぉそうじゃ\nインヴィディアに寄ったときには\nまたチョコ買ってきてくれんか？
qst202011_ms.json
1	We gave her the Fruity Rice Ball.
2	She said she give you big telling off\nlater!
3	I still think you made her day, though.
4	Heck, there's no getting past her,\nis there? I'll have to brace myself\nthen, won't I? Ha ha ha!
5	Urrggh *cough cough hack*
6	Hey! Are you OK, mister?
7	*cough cough splutter*
8	Me go call Vess!
9	W-wait! *cough cough* I'll be...\n*pant pant* I'll be fine...
10	There's no use worrying the lass.\nI'd appreciate it if you could keep\nthis quiet from her.
11	Yeah, but...
12	I'm fine. Don't you worry, I'm\nnot going to keel over and kick\nthe bucket just yet.
13	That reminds me... Mind if I bother\nyou with one more little errand?
14	You want us to get some medicine?
15	Medicine? No.\nLet's see... It was about...30 years ago\nnow, back when I was still serving.
16	Me and Vess, we got our hands on\na pair of golden bracers.
17	Whoa!
18	Yeah. A rare find, isn't it?
19	We were never particularly pressed\nfor money back in those days, so we\ndecided to hide 'em.
20	I want you to bring 'em back for me.
21	OK, can do. Where did you put them?
22	In the Fief of Forgetfulness in\nMor Ardain.
23	Thing is, according to Vess...
24	According to Vess...?
25	Ah, perfect timing! I was asking Rex\nhere if he wouldn't mind fetching those\nold bracers we buried back in the day.
26	In the Fief of Forgetfulness, wasn't it?
27	No, no, I think you've gotten mixed up.
28	It was at the Ruins of Fountain Park\nin the Kingdom of Uraya, as I recall.
29	Oh, er...was it? I don't remember\nburying them there...
30	No, I'm positive. It was definitely in\nUraya.
31	Hmm...
32	Oh, I don't know any more.\nCheck the both of those places\nand they'll turn up eventually!
33	Wow. Talk about careless...
34	Well if he can't remember, I guess\nthere's no way around it. We'll just\nhave to check both of those places out.
qst202012_ms.json
1	I need you to find a pair of\ngolden bracers I hid away\nnigh on 30 years ago.
2	As my memory serves, we buried\nthem in the Fief of Forgetfulness\nin Mor Ardain...
3	But Vess insists that it was at the\nRuins of Fountain Park in Uraya.
4	If you could check both of those\nlocations just to make sure, it'd\nbe fantastic.
5	I'm thinking of sending those bracers\nto my son and daughter.
6	My son's name is Antis. He should be\nin Alba Cavanich in Mor Ardain.
7	And my daughter's called Noelle.\nShe's living in Fonsa Myma, in Uraya.
8	I trust you to get the bracers to them.\nAnd of course, I'll be sure to reward\nyou handsomely when you're done!
qst202013_ms.json
1	We hid those bracers in the Ruins of\nFountain Park.
2	It was a long time ago, so my memory\nis a little hazy...
3	But I'm quite confident about this.\nWe walked a short way down a side\nroad and hid it around there.
4	Mabon has two children, a son and\na daughter.
5	Ohh, it really brings back memories.
6	I haven't seen them for quite\nsome time. I imagine they're all\ngrown up now.
7	They must be taller than Torigoth's\nwindmill by now, surely...
8	Well, they do say that growing\nas a person is a lifelong journey,\ndon't they?
9	Ha ha! I'm joking, of course!
qst202014_ms.json
1	Hey, Mr. Mabon!\nWe found what you were looking for!
2	Oh, you did? Let's have a look...\nYes! That's them all right!
3	It turn out you both right!\nWe find one in Mor Ardain,\nand other in Uraya!
4	Is that right? Well I never!
5	You're good kids for doing all this,\nyou know that? Thank you.
6	Eh, it was nothing.
7	Now, there's one last thing I'd like\nyou to do for me.
8	Ugh, there's more?
9	'Fraid so. I need you to deliver those\nbracers to my son and daughter.
10	They've each got their own families\nnow, out living in different nations.
11	Fine. I guess we might as well see this\nthrough to the end.
12	That's the ticket!\nThank you, lass.
13	My son's name is Antis. He should be\nin Alba Cavanich in Mor Ardain.
14	And my daughter's called Noelle.\nShe's living in Fonsa Myma, in Uraya.
15	I trust you to get the bracers to them.\nAnd of course, I'll be sure to reward\nyou handsomely when you're done!
qst202015_ms.json
1	Yes? How can I help you?
2	From daddy?
3	Oh gosh... Well, thank you for coming\nall the way here to deliver it.
4	Wait...this is a golden bracer!\nIt looks so expensive. I'm not\nsure I can accept this...
5	But then again, it is from Daddy...
6	How're he and Vess doing these days?
7	Vess looked after me and my brother\nfor most of my childhood, you know.
8	She's very calm and gentle for a Blade.\nThe kindest one I know.
9	Oh, that reminds me...here.
10	It's a necklace made from Pione Stone.
11	If you see Vess, could you please pass\nit on to her?
12	Thank you. That's very kind of you.
13	Vess was like a mother to us.
14	She's very calm and gentle for a Blade.\nThe kindest one I know.
15	I'd love to see her again sometime...
qst202016_ms.json
1	Hello? Who are you...?
2	Oh, from Daddy? Well, thanks for this.\nMust've been quite a trek.
3	Golden bracers... I remember hearing\nabout these when I was a kid.
4	Daddy and Vess are still their same old\nselves, I take it? I haven't seen them\nfor yonks.
5	Don't tell me - Vess is still making\nher same old dumplings?
6	Me and my sister used to love those.
7	We ought to all get together again\nsometime. I'd love to see Vess again.
8	Oh, yeah...
9	Could you pass this onto Daddy\nfor me? It's an accessory. I made it\nmyself.
10	He'll probably never use it, but at\nleast it'll remind him how we are.
11	Thanks a lot.
12	Vess is the only mother we ever really\nknew. She was always there for us.
13	She's such an important person to us.
14	I can almost taste her dumplings now.\nMmmm...
qst202017_ms.json
1	Hold on, my belly's starting to rumble.
2	Oh goodness, is it that late already?
3	Don't worry - I won't be ten minutes!\nI'll make enough for everyone.
4	So, what's on the menu today?
5	I'll give you three guesses.
6	Oh all right, I'll play along.\nCould it be...dumplings?
7	Spot on!
8	[ML:undisp ]*fit of coughing*
9	You all right there, man?
10	Yeah, don't you worry.\nJust a pesky little cough.
11	She's a sweet lass, isn't she?
12	Totally. And her cooking's top notch.
13	If making of dumplings is same as cooking...
14	She is perhaps a little misguided at times, but\nher love and compassion cannot be faulted.
15	Right...
16	My life never amounted to much, to be\nhonest with you.
17	I did some reckless things in my time,\nall to be the center of attention.
18	And every time I bungled something up, Vess\nand the kids'd suffer for it somehow.
19	But Vess, she stuck by my side all the\nsame.
20	She took the role of my dearly departed, bless her\nsoul, and started looking after the kids for me.
21	She's become a part of the family now. I don't\nknow what we'd do without her.
22	[ML:undisp ]*large cough*
23	And that's why...
24	I just want her to have a good life. Do you know\nwhat I'm saying?
25	[ML:undisp ]*cough cough*
26	Are you all right?!
27	I'm fine! I just need to lie down for a bit.
28	That seems like the best course of action.
29	Let me just...close my eyes a moment...
30	M-Mabon...?
qst202018_ms.json
1	We're back!
2	Ah, good to see you!
3	So? How were the bairns?
4	They seemed to be getting on just\nfine, from what I saw.
5	Made sure to hand over golden bracers!
6	Good, good.\nThat's another thing off my mind.
7	How were Antis and Noelle?\nThey must have grown quite\na bit since I last saw them...
8	They both looked like fine, respectable\ngrown-ups.
9	Oh yeah, they asked us to give you\nsome things in return.
10	Oh, how delightful!
11	Said they'd love to have a reunion\nsometime, too.
12	Oh, that would be wonderful.\nI'm getting excited already!
13	I haven't seen them since they got\nmarried. How many years has it been\nnow...?
14	We really must set a date!\nOh, isn't this good news, Mabon?
15	It is indeed!
16	So they're getting on just fine, are\nthey? There I was worrying over\nnothing, as usual.
17	Mr. Mabon's looking very happy.
18	'Course he is! Hearing your kids\nare coming to visit after a long time,\nanyone would be!
qst202019_ms.json
1	Oh, hello again. How is it going?
2	Here are the ingredients I'd like you\nto find:
3	5 clumps of Salty Soil, 8 portions\nof Gromrice, and 5 Ruby Mangosteens.
4	Good luck on your search!
5	Why, thank you! This is everything,\nisn't it?
6	It must have taken you quite some\ntime.
7	No, really, thank you.
8	Could I perhaps invite you round for\ndinner? Really it's the least I could do.
9	My house is on the far side of Tretl\nWindmill Plaza. Do come!
qst202020_ms.json
1	Can I ask you to buy me a sneaky\nbit of Bitter Choclit on the side?
2	I can't ask Vess or she'll just lecture\nmy lugs off.
3	She never buys the stuff for me.
4	You're a crafty old man, you know\nthat?
5	Fine. We'll get some of this choclit\nfor you.
6	Good lass.
7	Ah, would you mind buying us a\nFruity Rice Ball along with the choclit?
8	Where do we find these things?
9	For choclit, you'll want to go to\nFonsa Myma.
10	But Fruity Rice Balls? There's a dearth\nof them these days.
11	They used to be all over Gormott.\nArgentum, too.
12	I don't know, maybe we'll see a\nresurgence once trade improves.
13	All right. We'll find it somehow!
14	Thanks, lad. I'm counting on you!

1	He fall asleep...?
2	No. I'm afraid he's already...
3	No...
4	Everyone's got to go someday.\nEven Drivers.
5	It's a terrible thing, but that's just\nthe way of the world...
6	...
7	Ah...wait, where's Vess?
8	Driver and Blades are inextricably\nlinked. I expect she will have returned\nto her Core Crystal...
9	I'm gonna go and check on her!
10	I'll come with you!
qst202022_ms.json
1	It's true, then. She really did go back...
2	It'll have happened so suddenly...\nIt must have been a real shock.
3	We able to awaken her again?
4	You'll have to wait a while first for the\ncolor to return to how it was before.
5	But...that mean memories of Mabon\nall going to disappear?
6	I'm afraid so...
7	It is an inevitable part of the cycle.\nSuch is the fate of all Blades.
8	But we remember.
9	That right...
10	If Poppi and others still remember, we\nhave power to teach Vess about past.
11	Poppi sure she will be more than\nhappy to rediscover old memories.
12	Yeah... You're right.
13	Mabon only wanted the best for Vess.\nWe have to do what we can to make\nher happy.

1	Astounding! Stupendous!\nWhat a momentous find!
2	Gah!\n...You gave me a jump.
3	Please, listen!\nThis may well be the discovery of the century!
4	Look, just chill out for a second, Adenine.
5	What's all this about?
6	Oh, ah... Please excuse me.\nI got a little excited, I suppose...
7	I've been reading through all the\nTomes of Morytha we collected, and...
8	After deciphering all four volumes, it seems...!
9	It seems...?
10	It seems!
11	They reveal the location of a\nlong-lost ancient stone tablet!
12	That sounds...dull.\nAll that reading and that's what you got?
13	Now now, isn't that enough?\nIt's knowledge from the past!
14	So... What kind of thing is\nthis ancient tablet?
15	Well, seeing as how the books are\nknown as "Tomes of Morytha"...
16	I imagine it would contain wisdom from Morytha.
17	In other words, ancient knowledge on a slab!\nThe greatest treasure known to man!
18	Cool, huh? Are you all excited yet?
19	Why don't we go looking for it together?!
20	...That does sound interesting.\nI think we should do it, Rex.
21	I didn't think you'd be so keen, Pyra.
22	Well, I mean...\nIt's like a treasure hunt, no?
23	Uh, yeah I guess.\nSure, let's get preparations in order and go!
24	Oh boy!
25	Yeah! Woo!\nI knew you'd agree! Thank you, friends!
26	Right! Fortune favors the bold!\nLet's go!
27	No, see, I said "preparations", didn't I...?
qst202102_ms.json
1	Astounding!\nSo this is the ancient tablet!
2	That's...\nclearly more than just a stone slate...
3	At least it looks like a tablet I guess.\nStill, seems flimsy...
4	Is that...floating?
5	How about that weird little box? Suspicious...
6	Hmm...
7	It looks like some sort of device for\nshowing pictures floating in thin air...
8	Hmm. What a bizarre idea...
9	What kind of scientific wizardry is this...?
10	Truly, the ancients' grasp of technology\nwas on a level we could only dream of!
11	Adenine... Doesn't that look like writing?
12	Oh?\nYeah, now you mention it!
13	It's cool if I have a fiddle about with it, right?
14	No!\nZeke! It is not cool!
15	Uh, why?
16	...You can't fiddle about with ancient artifacts!\nWhat if you break something?!
17	The construction looks delicate,\nwe have to handle it very carefully...
18	Sorry, I guess.
19	So... Did you find any ancient knowledge yet?
20	Not quite yet... Let's see.
21	What's this now?\nIt's asking us to input some numbers or letters?
22	One, two, three...\nThere's space for 12 characters in total.
23	Ohhh, right...\nI see now!
24	Any insight, Adenine?
25	It's a challenge! The ancients are\nchallenging me to solve this riddle!
26	Now I'm feeling determined!
27	Everyone! To solve the puzzle of this stone tablet,\nI shall...retire to my room!
28	What?
29	Adios!
30	So...she's just gone...?
31	...Yeah she's gone.
qst202103_ms.json
1	Whoa?! Yippee-ki-yay!\nI got a response!
2	That's the tablet mystery solved, then!
3	Ah, no, I don't think we can consider it\nsolved completely just yet.
4	Say again?
5	Well, this stone tablet seems to be\nindicating the World Tree.
6	Isn't a part of it...glowing?
7	Yes! Bravo! Well spotted, Mòrag!
8	After we unlocked the tablet,\nthat part lit up.
9	I think it's showing us the part of the\nWorld Tree called the Data Processing\nRoom...
10	If we go there, something should be\nwaiting for us.
11	But there's no way to know\nunless we actually go and check?
12	Quite!
13	I have a duty to investigate\nas soon as possible!
14	Hey, Adenine, what're you-?!
15	There she goes again.
16	Yeah, but going alone to the\nWorld Tree? That's a whole new\nlevel of reckless!
17	We should hurry after her.
qst202104_ms.json
1	This is momentous!
2	*Gasp*\nBut what is this?
3	She's in her own little world.
4	Classic Adenine.
5	Geez...\nAdenine, stop running off by yourself...
6	Hold up, Nia.
7	Huh?
8	There's something inside the room...
9	An enemy?!
10	It would appear to be the room's guardian...
11	Adenine! It's not safe in there!
12	Save your breath, she's not listening.
13	Bad news!\nGoing for Adenine!
14	Adenine! Run!
15	Stop the shouting...\nCan't you see you're breaking my concentration?
16	Whah-!
17	How dare you come in here and interfere with my research?!\nI was just getting to the good bits, too...
18	You're not gonna put a damper on my\ncuriosity and studiousness! That's a promise!
19	Understood? Get the picture?\nShut up and let me work!
20	We probably shouldn't let Adenine\nhave all the fun.
21	Let's get in there and help, Rex!
qst202105_ms.json
1	Ahh, finally some peace and quiet.
2	Seriously...\nI thought we were done for a moment there.
3	Hey, Adenine?
4	...Uh, suddenly I'm more afraid\nof her than those monsters...
5	So, Adenine...\nWill you be able to make use of this ancient wisdom?
6	This room is a like a witness to the ancients' sophistication.
7	There's all sorts of mind-blowing information stored here!
8	It's a wondrous treasure trove of knowledge!\nI'm so very, very glad we all came here!
9	A-ah, it's overwhelming. I might faint.
10	Umm...\nAnything we can use, like, right now?
11	Nope!
12	Nope?!
13	Deciphering the tomes...
14	and then that tablet-like device as well?\nAll of that took considerable time as it is.
15	But it was a Nopon child's play compared to the\nstuff in here!
16	If I wanted to crack all of this...
17	It'd take a thousand years!
18	That...is a long time.
19	All you Drivers would have to find a way to\nstay alive for me for all that time!
20	Tora think that unlikely...
21	*sigh*\nClassic Adenine.
22	No kidding...

1	Hey, Adenine,\nd'you think it might be time to go?
2	I think we've done enough.
3	Adenine, should we head back?
4	You've been at it for a while.
5	Adenine, don't you think we should\nbe heading back soon?
6	This is not a good place to\ntarry in too long.
7	Hey, Adenine. Let's head back soon.
8	Don't you think you've done enough?
9	What are you saying?!\nI've got no intention of moving.
10	If you want to go back, then\nby all means, be my guest.
11	I'll just live here from now on.
12	Don't be ridiculous!
13	We've got stuff to do still!
14	No way, girl.
15	We've still got bigger fish to fry.
16	I cannot in good faith authorize that.
17	There are other matters we must\nall attend to.
18	No, come on. There's no way\nyou're doing that.
19	We've got loads to take care of.
20	But I don't want to!\nI don't want to be anywhere else!
21	If I don't research this place,\nwho do you think will?
22	This is of vital importance to\neveryone on Alrest!
23	I give up...\nI can see you're resolved.
24	Fine, you can keep investigating\nuntil you're happy.
25	I can't deal with this.\nI can see you won't budge...
26	Go ahead then, study it as much\nas you want.
27	Your will really is indomitable, Adenine.
28	I'll acquiesce.\nYou can study this place to your\nheart's content.
29	Yeah, yeah, OK.\nYou win, Adenine.
30	You can keep up your investigation\nor what have you. Just come help us\nout sometime too, OK?
31	Awesome!
32	Thanks, Driver dearest!
33	I just love understanding,\nand I'm glad we've reached one!
qst202201_ms.json
1	'Scuse me...
2	Mm? What's up, Electra?
3	My zappy powers are super awesome,\nright?
4	Oh, definitely. I only have to stand\nnext to you to feel my hairs standing\non end!
5	Right?
6	I'm always giving it my all,\nso my power's like, always\noverflowing too.
7	It uh...it doesn't bug you or anything?
8	I guess maybe I am a little scared\nsometimes that I might touch you by\naccident and get myself zapped...
9	But it's not really that much of a deal,\nI don't think.
10	But how am I supposed to control\nmy powers if I'm always releasing\nthem at full blast?
11	I wish I could be more like Pyra.\nShe's got hers under control...
12	Now, don't be like that, Electra.\nI think you're very charming in\nyour own unique way.
13	Yeah! Everything's a whole lot brighter\nwhen you're around, Electra!
14	Isn't that just because my lightning's\nilluminating the place...?
15	Nu-uh. You're cute as a button and\nyou're fun to be around. You really\ncheer us all up.
16	Mmmm...
17	I dunno...
18	I feel like the only thing I'm good at\nright now is fighting...
qst202202_ms.json
1	Oh!
2	[ML:undisp ]
3	Hey, what's wrong?
4	Aaahhhh!
5	What the-?
6	Oh, I'm so sorry!
7	Waaaahhhhh!
8	Hey!\nCome back!
9	I...I didn't mean to...
10	I was just trying to help.\nI never meant to hurt him...
11	It's OK, Electra.\nIt was just an accident, right?
12	*sob*\nRex...
13	That kid was pretty down in the dumps,\nbut thanks to you he took off like a shot.
14	So I guess you helped?
15	N-Nia!\n*sob*
16	Owww!
17	*sob* See, Nia? I even hurt you...
18	If I can't control my own power,\nit would be better if I just didn't have it.
19	*sob*
qst202203_ms.json
1	Now she's over there...
2	She's a nippy little one, isn't she?
3	Sure, but we've gotta go after her\nbefore we lose sight of her!
4	I know, I know.\nShe'll probably be bawling her eyes out again.
5	I worry about her...
6	Yeah... Come on!
qst202204_ms.json
1	How much further is she\ngoing to keep running?!
2	That girl's got enough energy to run the\nlength of the Gormotti Titan.
3	She must be really upset, to be running\naround all over the place like this...
4	Yeah... We'd better find her quickly\nand help her out, the poor thing.
qst202205_ms.json
1	Electra!\nWe finally caught up with you.
2	Please, don't come near me, OK?\nI can't control my own power.
3	I can't help it, I just end up zapping everyone...
4	That's as may be, but don't worry about it.
5	Your power is a massive help to us!
6	He's right.\nIt certainly doesn't matter to me.
7	R-really?
8	No word of a lie, kid.
9	You still have much growing to do.\nPerhaps a little training is in order?
10	Training?
11	That good idea.
12	You must connect with your powers and,\nin doing so, learn how to better control them.
13	And then...you won't accidentally\nshock people anymore!
14	You won't hurt anyone ever again.
15	No more random shocks...especially not for me!
16	Wow...\nMaybe you're right!
17	Thanks for the advice, everyone!\nThank you very much!
18	I'm going to train as hard as I can!\nI'll get this power under control, you'll see!
19	I owe you guys big-time!
20	Argh, stoppit!
qst202206_ms.json
1	It's beautiful. I've never seen\nanything like it...
2	I know, right? And we've got Electra\nto thank for this one!
3	Aww, gee... Thanks so much!
4	Think you're starting to get the hang of\ncontrolling your power now, Electra?
5	Yeah, I'm totally fine with it now!\nThank you, thank you, thank you!
6	Like, sooo much!
7	Oh, we didn't do all that much, really.
8	I was gonna say! You're the one\nthat made this happen, Electra.
9	Mmmm...nope! You were all helping\nme out from the get-go. I couldn't've\ndone it without you guys!
10	*sniffle...*
11	Whoa, hold on.\nAre you crying there, Shellhead?!
12	I just... This must be how it feels to\nsee my own daughter growing up...
13	Daughter? I think you've got marriage\nto worry about first there, buddy!
14	You overcame your own shortcomings,\nElectra. You're already coming along in\nleaps and bounds.
15	You've really done incredibly well.
16	Thanks! I guess I do try!
17	So can I, uh...ask you something?
18	Sure.
19	Remember that kid who started crying\n'cos of me back in Torigoth?
20	The one you zapped, yeah?
21	I kinda ran away 'cos I didn't like\nmy own powers back then...
22	But now, I feel like I should apologize\nto the boy. If he starts crying again,\nI want to help him this time.
23	I get it.\nAll right, let's go and look for him!
24	What, really?!
25	Really. And this time, you can show\nhim just how far you've grown!
26	Eeeeee, thank yooou!
27	We'll probably have to ask around\nTorigoth to work out where the kid\nis. That fine with you?
28	Totally!
qst202207_ms.json
1	Hey, 'scuse me...
2	Hmm? Whassat?
3	Y'know the boy I zapped the other\nday? Have you seen him around?
4	Ohh! You're that sparky girl!\nYou lookin' for Izzi, then?
5	Izzi... That's his name?
6	Yeh. He's usually playin' around\nabout here...but I s'pose he's not\ncomin' today.
7	OK, guess we'll have to look\nsomeplace else then.
8	Yeh. Bye-bye, sparky girl!
qst202208_ms.json
1	Excuse me, can I ask you something?
2	Meh?! What you want?
3	B-b-buzzy-buzzy Blade?!
4	Huh?!
5	N-n-no! Not touch buzzy-buzzy!\nHate buzzy-buzzy!
6	Oh, don't worry! I'm not gonna zap\nyou, I just wanted to-
7	Meh-meh? ...No! Not come any closer!\nKeep buzzy-buzzy away!
8	I think we should probably ask\nsomeone else...
9	...
10	Don't let it bother you, Electra.
11	We're sure to find someone who'll\nunderstand the efforts you went to\neventually.
12	Right... Yeah. I'll keep trying!
qst202209_ms.json
1	Um, excuse me...
2	Yeah?
3	I'm looking for a boy. I kinda\nshocked him by accident before...\nAny idea where he might be?
4	Oh hey, you're the sparky girl\neveryone's going on about.
5	...People talk about me that much?
6	Yeah. You go around catching bad kids\nand zapping them with lightning, right?
7	Doesn't really bother me, though.\nI know I've been good.
8	Uh, wait, no no, that's all wrong!\nDon't worry, I'd never do anything\nlike that!
9	Anyway, can you tell me about\nthe boy?
10	Mmm...I only know what my mum told\nme. I don't really know him proper.
11	Sorry.
12	Oh, OK. Well, thanks anyway!
qst202210_ms.json
1	Hey, it's the sparky girl!
2	Mm?
3	You gonna zap poor Izzi again?!
4	Izzi is kid that Electra zap before?
5	Yeah. Poor little dizzy Izzi!
6	Uh, actually I'm here to apologize\nto him. D'you know where he is?
7	Yeah, right, I bet you just wanna zap\nhim again!
8	It OK now! Electra learn to control\nzappy-zaps. No more buzzy-buzzy!
9	...What, really?
10	It true. Electra try to help friends with\npowers, not hurt.
11	Whole reason why Argentum look\nsparkly-sparkly because of Electra!
12	Oh yeah, I heard about that.\nI wish I could've seen it...
13	OK then, I'll trust you.
14	But hang on, Izzi's not around\nright now.
15	Can you tell me where he is then?
16	He said he was gonna collect some\nrare bugs or something? I dunno.
17	He went off towards Koorell Pool,\nso he's probably there?
18	Great, thanks! I'm gonna go look for\nhim now!
19	Fair enough. Just promise you two\nare gonna make up, OK?
20	Sure thing! Promise!
qst202211_ms.json
1	Aaah!
2	Sounded like a child!
3	Over there, Rex!
4	Isn't that...the kid Electra's been looking for?
5	Help meeee!
6	Don't you dare touch the kid!
7	Pick on someone your own size, you rotter!
8	Let's go!
qst202212_ms.json
1	It's all right. She won't shock you.
2	Are you sure...?
3	Yes. Very sure.
4	Now...why don't you say thank you\nto the nice lady?
5	...OK.
6	Wow, miss!
7	It's true!\nYou're not shocking me!
8	That's great!\nI'm not dead of the 'lectric!
9	Oh...haha, thank goodness I didn't electrocute you!
10	Thanks very much, miss!
11	Don't mention it...\nI should thank you!
12	It's only thanks to you that\nI finally learned to love my powers.
13	I feel like I'm all grown up now!\nWell...a little bit, at least! Haha...
qst202213_ms.json
1	OK, you should be fine from here,\nright?
2	Yeah! Thanks a lot, miss!
3	We should play again sometime!\nByeee!
4	Totally! See you!
5	I can actually, genuinely use my\npowers to help people now...
6	And it's even helped me to make\nfriends...
7	I'm so, so grateful that you helped\nme out, guys. I feel more confident\nabout myself than I ever did before!
8	Say hello to the new and improved\nElectra, now better than ever!
9	Haha! I can't wait to see you in\naction now!
10	Heh! Now that's more like it!
11	That sounds very promising.\nI look forward to seeing you in action.
12	Sorry, I've...*sniff*...just got\nsomething in my eye...\nLooking forward to it, Electra...
13	Yeah!
14	Zzzzaaap! Crash! Kapoooow!\nIt's time to get buzzy!
qst202214_ms.json
1	Easy does it...\nEasy does it...
2	Electra?
3	You all right?
4	Yep, just a little longer...
5	Everything's going to be fine!\nI can definitely do this.
6	I did it!
7	Meh meh meh!
8	It beautiful.
9	That was amazing!
10	Way to go!
11	Thanks, guys! Told you I could do it!
12	Whoa!
13	Eheheh!
14	It looks like you made that thing your own.
15	I would say that is your true power, Electra.
16	Yeah! Your power certainly brought\na smile to everyone's face.
17	That's...my power?
18	Yeah. Nice one, Electra!
19	Wow, I don't know what to say... I, uh...\nMaking people happy feels pretty good.
qst202215_ms.json
1	Where's Electra?
2	Can't see her anywhere...
3	Look! I saw lightning from over there!
4	Big thundercrash? That Electra all right.
5	But how the heck did she get over...?\nC'mon, Rex, let's move!
6	Right! Let's make for Electra!
qst202301_ms.json
1	Zenobia asked us to meet her\nhere, but she's not here herself...
2	Did we get the right time?
3	Yes, I'm sure of it.
4	More likely she just oversleep or something.
5	Good! I made it just in time!
6	Actually a little bit late.
7	Huh? Sorry! Sorry!\nOK, I guess I am late.
8	I got a bit sidetracked fighting a\nmassive monster on the way here.
9	I must have gotten a bit carried away in the thick of it.
10	Zenobia, you're always up for it. I like that.
11	Haha! You know it.
12	So what did you want to\ntalk to us about, Zenobia?
13	Right!\nI wanted to lodge a complaint.
14	You all know how much I like fighting\nreally powerful enemies, right?
15	And, I'm really grateful that you've been giving me duties where I\nmight run into some decent opponents...
16	So... What's the beef exactly?
17	Well, the beef...
18	is that they're all so lame!
19	Like, if I don't ever fight any really huge bad-ass beasts,\nI can't truly express myself in battle!
20	I need to feel that life-or-death\ntension to really get my pulse going.
21	I mean, half of the battles I wind up fighting\nI could win in my sleep!
22	In other words, you're asking to fight tougher opponents?
23	Exactly!
24	If I can't get out of this rut, my skills\nare going to stagnate, atrophy.
25	Zenobia... I'm not sure there's enough of these\ncrazy bad-ass monsters to go around.
26	Well... We have Pyra and Mythra here.\nI could just have a pop at them.
27	That sounds like a bad idea...
28	...Well, yeah...
29	So why don't we go out and find some baddies to bash?
30	It's a big world!
31	There's got to be one or two worthy opponents out there,\nat the very least.
32	Just a couple of full-blown behemoths.\nSurely, we can find something?
33	I tell you, if we don't, I'm gonna explode!
34	I might have to vent my\nfrustration on one of you guys!
35	Meh-meh-meh!
36	We can't have that. OK, let's look for some.
37	Roger that. It's kind of a Driver's responsibility.
38	Yeah, I guess.\nWe can't have you going feral on us now, can we?
39	Hey, why don't we give her the moon on a stick?
40	Ahahaa!\nThank you, everyone!
41	OK! Let's get out there and get on with the hunt!
qst202302_ms.json
1	OK, so let's say we head out and try\nand find one of these deadly beasts...\nDoes anyone know where to find one?
2	'Fraid not.
3	Not the Zekenator's area, I'm afraid.
4	Not know!
5	Ah... No.
6	Hey, c'mon! You must know of at least\none decent monster somewhere?
7	To be honest, I don't think about it all\nthat much.
8	You've gotta admit, finding a monster\nthat'll satisfy Zenobia is gonna be\npretty tough. Impossible maybe.
9	No doubt about it.
10	Huh?!\nIt sounds like you want to give up\nbefore we even started!
11	Yeah, what a bunch of defeatists! I hate\nto break it to you, but we're not\nactually totally clueless here...
12	Mythra... You know something...?
13	Well, I mean, it's kind of an old\nrumor. Maybe it'll just turn out\nto be a fairytale.
14	Anything's better than nothing!\nC'mon, tell us about it!
15	Back in the day, they say that there\nwas a monster with awesome power...\nA king of the beasts, if you will...
16	But it was just too strong... No one\ncould defeat it...
17	In the end, even after many sacrifices,\nthe best the people of the time could\nmanage was to seal it away.
18	Yeah! That's the one I'm looking for\nall right!
19	So... Now all I need to know is where\nit is!
20	I don't know.
21	Aww! You got me all worked up there!\n"I don't know" just doesn't cut it,\nMythra!
22	Well, if I don't know, that's all I\ncan say! That's the way it goes.
23	But, Mythra... If your memory serves\nyou correctly, then surely there'll be a\nrecord of it somewhere?
24	Ah... Maybe we could check out the\nlibrary at Theosoir?
25	They've got heaps of old records\nstuffed away there.
26	Yeah?
27	For realsies.
28	So we've gotta go there!\nThanks, Zeke!
29	I'll let you help me take on this vile\nbeast by way of thanks!
30	No, it's fine...seriously...
31	OK!\nLet's all head for Tantal!
qst202304_ms.json
1	It's a pretty humongous library, right?\nThere's more than ten million books\nhere, y'know.
2	Well, I don't know much about this\nkind of thing, but it sounds like a lot!
3	This place has basically got every\nsingle book, from every time and place.\nIf there's a clue, it must be here.
4	Yeah! No doubt! You hear that,\nmega-beast? We're comin' for ya!
5	Hey, why don't we split up and look\nfor it?
6	*sigh*
7	All that searching turned up nothing...
8	Sorry about that, Zenobia.
9	No, it's hardly your fault, Pandoria.\nIt's fine.
10	Wow, she sounds seriously gutted...
11	I guess getting your hopes up that high\nonly sets you up for disappointment...
12	Ah, Zenobia. It breaks my heart to see\nyou so crestfallen.
13	Someone must know about this\nsealed-up legendary beast! Wouldn't\nbe much of a legend if they didn't...
qst202305_ms.json
1	Excuse me, my Prince... Did you\nperchance mention a "sealed-up\nlegendary beast"?
2	Huh? Sorry, mate. Do I know you?
3	Apologies, my Prince. My name is\nZaman. I'm a wandering bard.
4	There's actually a song about a\nlegendary sealed-up beast in the\ncorpus of poetry that I hold dear.
5	I was reminded of it when I heard you\nspeak of it... Your stentorian tones\ncertainly carry, my Prince!
6	You've heard of it?!
7	What does it say about it in this song\nof yours?
8	Ahem. It is the epic tale of a band of\nheroes who sealed away the infamous\nand vile creature...
9	The heroes set out, together with their\nloyal Blades and many allies...
10	But the beast was strong! Its vile\npower was the sort that could grind\na whole nation to dust!
11	For this reason, they called the fiend\n"Thanatobeast Andraz".
12	Wow! What a cool name! It must have\nreally been something!
13	The mighty heroes commanded\ngreat power. Yet, it was not enough\nto fell the beast with finality.
14	They laid down their lives, but all they\ncould do was seal it away.
15	In the song, they used four sealstones\nto bind its monstrosity.
16	So that it remained locked away,\nthey hid the stones in four different\nlands.
17	OK! Great! So where do I find these\nstones, then?
18	Well, according to the song...
19	One, the stone of earth, is in a land of\nverdant forest; another, the stone of\nfire, in a sweltering waste.
20	The stone of water abides in the watery\nland of eternal spring. The last, of wind,\nin a tiny country blessed by sea breeze.
21	That's what the song says, anyway!
22	So what are we waiting for? Let's go\nand find those stones!
23	Erm... May I ask... What will you do if\nyou find those stones?
24	That's easy.
25	We'll smash them, and bring\nThanatobeast Andraz back to life!
26	Then I'll smash him up till he's well\nand truly decked!
27	You mean you're going to defeat\nThanatobeast Andraz?
28	Ahahahaha!\nThat is really very amusing!
29	You must be the very first person I've\nmet who's taken that old tale seriously.
30	Yeah, I believe it. Mythra here had\nheard of it, too.
31	By the way, where is this thing sealed\naway exactly?
32	Maybe there's a hint about that in\nthe song or something?
33	Ah...indeed...
34	So...what is it?
35	Actually...I forgot.
36	What? How could you forget the most\nimportant part?
37	To be honest, I never thought anyone\nwould want to find it...
38	But, have no fear! I believe my old\nmentor will know the rest of the song!
39	I'll ask him about it before\nyou remove the four seals.
40	When you've done that, meet me at\nAnastatia's.
41	OK! We'd better start looking for these\nstones then!
42	May you be successful!

1	Well, that's all the sealstones\ngood and destroyed.
2	If the stories are true, the Thanatobeast\nshould be awakening any moment now.
3	Ooh, I can't wait!
4	I finally get to face the terrible Andraz!
5	There's no telling how powerful\nthis foe might prove to be.\nStay on your guard, everyone.
6	Yeah...
7	Tora so nervous whole body is shaking!
8	Sure, shaking with excitement!
9	...
10	...
11	...
12	...
13	...
14	...
15	Guys, nothing's happening!
16	Huh... That's strange...
17	Could we have overlooked some\nkey piece of the puzzle?
18	Maybe we should go back and\nask about it one more time.
19	I guess you're right...
20	OK then...
21	But what am I meant to do with this\nfeverish anticipation that's blazing\nwhite-hot in my heart?!
22	We're almost there, I'm sure you\ncan hang on a little longer.
23	I can't! I really can't!
24	C'mon, let's head back quickly.\nBefore Zenobia actually explodes.
25	Meh-meh?
qst202311_ms.json
1	Here we are!
2	Have you really removed\nthe four seals?
3	Yup. Did you expect anything less?
4	How about you? Did you manage to\nget the location of Thanatobeast\nAndraz from your old teacher?
5	Indeed I did! You will find the fiend at\nXataris Spring in Temperantia.
6	Temperantia... Makes sense. If I was\na Thanatobeast, that's probably where\nI'd be snoozing.
7	Well, better get going.
8	Please, one moment!
9	You won't find the Thanatobeast simply\nby going to Xataris Spring.
10	Huh?\nIs that right?
11	Apparently there's one more seal tying\nit down to the place of its slumber.
12	To break it, you'll need to destroy four\nmore sealstones - the stones of\nlight, darkness, thunder and ice.
13	More sealing?\nThis really very complicated...
14	They must have felt like they needed to\nbind it up really tightly.
15	I bet it was something unimaginably\nterrible, huh?
16	Yes! Really most horrible monster!
17	If this isn't the baddest-assed monster\nto ever disgrace the world, I won't be\nable to contain my disappointment.
18	Well, we know the place now.
19	Let's go to Xataris Spring and break the\nlast seal. Then we can finally take care\nof Thanatobeast Andraz!
20	Zenobia! Wait for Tora!

1	Hey... I don't know how this small fry\ngot a cool name like "Thanatobeast"...
2	Hardly worthy of the name!\nIt fought like it didn't even care.
3	What... The little blighter's come back to life!
4	It looks that way.\nIncredible regenerative powers...
5	Hmph...
6	So we went to all that trouble,\nand now it's alive again?
7	Cool!\nI hope it is!
8	But... What if monster just come back to life AGAIN?
9	No no! It's all good!
10	If it's not dead, well, I'll just\nget to kill it all over again!
11	All right! Time for Round Two!
qst202318_ms.json
1	It's no good!\nThere's no way to stop it!
2	I'm gonna run dry...if it keeps coming at us like this!
3	It's not showing any signs of stopping...
4	Kill it too difficult!\nMaybe that why it was sealed in first place...
5	Tora's right!\nWe should have left well alone...
6	Nuh-uh!\nAt least it's finally living up to its name!
7	We've run into a half-decent monster for once.\nI'm having a great time!
8	Well, let's do it!\nNothing for it but to give it everything I've got!
9	Here I come!!!
10	Is she for real?
11	Never make Zenobia angry...
12	Hahahahaa!
13	That cleared the cobwebs!
qst202319_ms.json
1	Zenobia's final attack was super-duper!
2	No kidding. You made me feel sorry for\nthe poor little Thanatobeast.
3	Did that monster-bashing make\nZenobia happy?
4	Hmmm... Well, honestly, not so much.
5	What?!
6	That's not what your face was saying,\nZenobia.
7	Well, OK, that one attack did feel\npretty good.
8	I mean... Everyone pitched in on that\nbattle. We did it together.
9	So, I can't really take all the credit,\ncan I?
10	Huh? Really?
11	I'm just saying how it is!
12	It's a one-on-one slugfest that I really\ncrave!
13	So, yeah! I've gotta find something even\nstronger than that wimpy Thanatobeast\nand defeat it with my own strength.
14	I mean... She'll never respect me as a\nrival if I don't prove myself...
15	Zenobia... Do you want to take Mythra\non, maybe?
16	Zenobia... Are you spoiling for a ruck\nwith Mythra or something?
17	Now I understand. You want to fight\nMythra, don't you?
18	Zenobia... Are you looking for a scrap\nwith Mythra?
19	Well, maybe... But I mean...now's not\nthe right time.
20	Not the right time?
21	I...I'm not strong enough yet...\nThere's no way I could stand up to an\nAegis.
22	So I've gotta get a whole lot stronger!
23	If there's another powerful monster\nout there, then I want to take it on!
24	I bet there's a bunch of crazy-tough\nbattles out there just waiting for us!
25	Got the message loud and clear!\nZenobia, with you around, there's\nnothing to be scared of.
26	Ah... I doubt I can talk you out of it...\nBut I've no fear of any monster with\nyou backing me up!
27	Understood. Well, Zenobia...we need\nfear no monster with you on our side.
28	Well, if we do bump into anything like\nthat, I'm sure you'll be able to sort\nthem out in a jif, Zenobia!
29	Teeheehee...!
30	I knew I could count on my Driver!\nAnd you can count on me too!
qst202320_ms.json
1	To awaken Thanatobeast Andraz, you\nmust destroy the four sealstones.
2	The song tells of their locations.
3	One, the stone of earth, is in a land of\nverdant forest, another, the stone of\nfire, in a sweltering waste.
4	The stone of water abides in the watery\nland of eternal spring. The last, of wind,\nin a tiny country blessed by sea breeze.
5	That's what the song says, anyway!
6	I'll go and consult with my old teacher\nabout the location of the beast while\nyou're breaking the four seals.
7	May you be victorious.
8	You will find Thanatobeast Andraz in\na place called Xataris Spring in\nTemperantia.
9	I hope you'll be back afterwards to\ntell me the tale of your epic\nbeast-slaying!
10	Perhaps it'll be the inspiration for a\nnew song...
qst202401_ms.json
1	Meh meh!\nYou bring Tirkin here?
2	How dare show face around here!
3	??
4	Don't play dummy-dumb with\nNoganga! You in big trouble!
5	What?\nDo you think Finch is a Tirkin?
6	...She not?
7	No way!\nA Tirkin? Me?\nI'm a Blade!
8	If that true then why you\nnot say earlier?
9	Look too similar to Tirkin so probably\neverybody confused all the time!
10	You're the one who jumped\nto conclusions, pal!
11	What do you have against\nTirkin, anyway?
12	Glad you asked!
13	It all start when Noganga come back\nhome after negotiating in Gormott.
14	Titan ship was attacked by Tirkin\nand Noganga's precious Nopon\nTrade Guild ID was stolen!
15	Now to do trading, Noganga must\nwade through many red tapes\nand bureaucratic nonsense.
16	Tirkin take anything that shiny!
17	And so birdbrain that they immediately\nforget where they hide things!
18	It all Tirkin's fault that Noganga\ncannot trade easily any more!
19	So you understand why sight of\nTirkin lookalike make Noganga angry!
20	Are you done venting?
21	Hey, Boppi, did you hear?
22	Fishy Fishy are having a half-price\nsale on fish paste. Let's go\nshopping there later!
23	Bargain is good! Leave it to Poppi\nto carry all shopping bags!
24	Finch! Are you even listening?
25	Uhh, what were we talking about again?
26	Noganga was just saying how\nmuch you look like a Tirkin.
27	Oh yeah, I remember now! Well I have\nno idea what he's talking about.
28	What part of me is supposed\nto look like a Tirkin, exactly?\nI couldn't be more different!
29	No no! No matter which way you\nslice it, you exactly Tirkin!
30	And inside head is birdbrain too!
31	Nuh-uh! Is not!
32	Hehe. If you better in brains than\nstupid Tirkin, prove it!
33	With pleasure! You know what,\nI'm gonna go get back your dumb\nNopon Trade Guild ID!
34	If I manage it, that's gotta be proof\nthat I'm smarter than a Tirkin, right?
35	Finch...\nWhy do I get the feeling you played\nright into his hands there?
36	I-it's OK! Doesn't matter!\nIt's all good!
37	So where was this whatever\nthingummy ID stolen?
38	We were attacked while passing by\nLeftherian Archipelago.
39	Tirkin lair definitely around\nthere somewhere!
40	If you bring back Noganga's ID,\nit proof you smarter than Tirkin!
41	OK! Let's do this, people!
qst202402_ms.json
1	If you return Noganga's Nopon Trade\nGuild ID, it proof that you smarter\nthan Tirkin, even though look same.
2	Hurry to Leftherian Archipelago!\nGet Nopon Trade Guild ID back\nfrom Tirkin lair!
3	Without ID, Noganga cannot trade!
qst202403_ms.json
1	That Nopon Trade Guild ID should\nbe around here somewhere.
2	Hey, look! Look at this!\nI found a weird-shaped stone.
3	Uh, did you forget what we\nwere looking for?
4	Uhh... Errr...
5	We're looking for Noganga's\nstolen Nopon Trade Guild ID.
6	That certainly sounds familiar...
7	Intruders!\nWhat you doing, craa?!
8	We've been spotted!\nBattle stations, everyone!
9	...They're not attacking.
10	What's going on?\nIs it a trap of some kind?
11	Kountess!\nWe find kountess, craa!
12	Kountess return!
13	Must tell King!
14	But King already gone to\nArgentum, craa!
15	You right!
16	But kountess returned!\nCraa! Craa! Craa!
17	Craa! Craa! Craa!
18	What's going on?\nI'm not a Tirkin!
19	Don't be silly, kountess!\nWe know you anywhere!
20	Kountess!
21	W-wait just a second!\nStop squawking for a minute!
22	I have no idea what's going on here.
23	Looks like they have Finch confused\nfor somebody else? I think?
24	Seems to be it.\nAt any rate, we won't find that\nNopon Trade Guild ID like this.
25	I feel bad for the Tirkin, but\nwe're going to have to quieten\nthem down the hard way.
qst202404_ms.json
1	Gah, I can't believe they thought I was\na Tirkin. That hurts. It really hurts.
2	Well, we got rid of all the Tirkin.\nLet's go home.
3	Wait! Didn't we come here to look for\nthe Nopon Trade Guild ID?
4	...Huh?\nWas that what we were doing?
5	Oh, give me strength.\nLet's just find it and go!
6	Sure thing!
qst202405_ms.json
1	Hey, is this your missing\nNopon Trade Guild ID?
2	Yes! That Noganga's ID!\nCannot believe you really did it.
3	So you'll admit that I'm\nsmarter than a Tirkin?
4	Yes, even though look just like one\nyou definitely better than birdbrain!
5	But how did you get ID back?
6	Uh, well...
7	We...uh...with the thing...and the\nother thing...
8	Finch totally forgot...
9	Completely Tirkin after all! ...No,\nactually, even more birdbrain than that!
10	There something wondrous about\nbrain like yours. Cannot believe it exist.
11	Oh my word, I'm blushing!\nWhat a compliment!
12	It wasn't compliment!
qst202406_ms.json
1	Ohh, nononononono! Terrible news! Tirkin\nlaunch attack on us!
2	The Tirkin?!
3	Are they even capable of organizing an attack?!
4	We get shipment on deck, giant box.\nThen all of sudden, Tirkin leap out!
5	It completely unheard of! Whole of Goldmouth in total uproar!
6	Hey! Hey, Nora. What do you think might be for dinner?
7	Nora not know. Tora not know either!
8	I'm really in something like a Stuffed Meaty Carrot mood.
9	Ah, so tasty...
10	Yeah! Sometimes I dream about being\nburied in a pile of Stuffed Meaty Carrots.
11	Please focus, you two.\nWe do not have time for this inanity!
12	This very serious situation!
13	If Tirkin go wild in Goldmouth, business\nin deep deep trouble!
14	This no time to be thinking about that!
15	It extremely dangerous to stay here.\nMust evacuate immediately!
16	Fool of a pon!
17	Merchant without shop is like fish without water.\nNoganga not move one inch!
18	This all happen because you too weak and you\nnot shooshoo Tirkin!
19	It all your fault!
20	Think of victims and lost revenue!\nNoganga expect Drivers to clean up own mess!
21	It seems we've no choice but to step in.
22	Tirkin surely here to take revenge on you!
23	Especially birdbrain! Birdbrain need to take\nresponsibility!
24	Huh? Do I really?
25	But I don't even remember what I did...\nI...guess it could've been our fault?
26	Whoa whoa whoa. Don't let 'em pin this on us.
27	Anyway, this is no time for chitchat.\nWe've gotta minimize the casualties!
28	Come on, let's move, people!
29	That what Noganga like to see!
30	Come on, Finch. We need to clear out the Tirkin\nand save everyone on the ship!
31	Jeez, do we have to? I feel like we're just\nbeing roped into this...
qst202407_ms.json
1	Why are you even here?
2	Kountess go bye-bye so we\nlook for her! Craa!
3	We hear dirty furballs karried\nkountess to Argentum!
4	To rescue kountess, we became\nkargo and kame here!
5	Right, I see.\nYou guys must be really dedicated\nto this countess person.
6	We'd be more than happy to help you\nfind her. What's her name and what\ndoes she look like?
7	Kountess's name, craa?
8	Guys, do you remember?
9	Can't remember, craa!
10	What was it again?
11	How can you be looking for someone\nwhen you don't remember them?
12	Come on, I've gotta be smarter\nthan THEM!
13	Craa! You look just like kountess!
14	You want be kountess\nand nest with us? Craa!
15	Yikes! No thank you!
16	Kountess get three meals a day\nand unlimited naptime, craa!
17	It sweet deal, yes yes?
18	Hmm...
19	Why not, sounds good!
20	Definitely passing on that, sorry.
21	What? Finch, no!\nHave you lost your mind?
22	We'll bring back the Tirkin countess\nand save you from this terrible fate.
23	Three meals a day and unlimited\nnaptime? Sounds nice...but, no thanks.
24	Really?\nThat krying shame.
25	Don't suppose there are any clues\nto the countess's whereabouts?
26	Let's see if the mercs can gather\nany information for us.
27	Before we bring her back we have\nto figure out where she is, I suppose!
qst202408_ms.json
1	Kountess went missing!\nFind kountess kwickly! Craa!
2	Mercenaries and information\nbroker might able find kountess!
3	Still not know where kountess?
4	Maybe it better if Tirkin\njoin search! Craa, craa!
5	Kountess is in Tantal!
6	Hurry!\nMust rescue kountess kwickly!
qst202409_ms.json
1	Isn't that Countess Omulette?
2	Looks like it.\nShe certainly fits the description.
3	But she doesn't look very kidnapped.\nShe looks like she's enjoying herself.
4	Well that's strange. Maybe\nit's not her after all.
5	Let's just go over and see!
6	Good idea. Let's see what\nshe has to say.
7	Are you the Countess Omulette?
8	And you are?
9	One of your people sent\nus to rescue you.
10	Rescue? Me?!
11	But you don't appear to be in danger.\nWhat's going on?
12	Craa craa...
13	Why am here again?
14	Huh?
15	You...forgot?
16	You lot. Does anyone remember\nhow Omulette ended up here?
17	Craa, details escep me!
18	She always been here, craa?
19	You cannot be serious.\nEveryone forgot?
20	Wow, that's a pretty shiny rock.
21	It piece of Bellflower Krystal!\nMy preciousest treasure, craa!
22	Wow, that's so cool!
23	FINCH!\nAre you even listening?
24	Oh, uh... Well that solves the\nmystery of whatever we were\ndoing! Time to go home!
25	No no no, what we were doing\nis trying to bring the countess\nback to her home, remember?
26	What, really?
27	Me go home?\nWhere home is?
28	Countess Omulette. The King is\nsearching for you, so would you\naccompany us back to your home?
29	Father lookink for me?\nOK, craa! I go with you!
30	Yay! Follow me, I'll get you\nback safely to Torigoth.
31	*sigh* It's Argentum.
qst202410_ms.json
1	Well, that's got them in a proper tizzy!
2	They are most delight by songstress song, craa!
3	We mek Nopon new kountess!\nThat's why Tirkin excites!
4	And you're OK with that...?
5	Huh, and we thought you might have wanted your\nreal countess back.
6	Y-you find real kountess?! Craaa!
7	Much thanks, heroes! You save our kountess!
8	I dunno if we "saved" her as such. She did look\nlike she'd been enjoying herself.
9	She definitely took a bit of persuading.
10	We most grateful.
11	Kome! We celebrate return of kountess together!
12	You mean, we get to eat free tasties?!
13	I wonder if they have my favorite,\nJuicy Samod?
14	What? I don't think that's\nyour favorite, Finch.
15	Oh, yeah, silly me, I meant\nCream Orange Paratha.
16	That's MY favorite, you twit!
17	...Anyway, I see no reason to decline. Shall we?
18	Uhh... Have you guys seen Finch?
19	Mm? She was right next to you until a moment ago.
20	Craaa! The moment you are all waiting! Return of kountess!
21	Behold! True Tirkin kountess is heres!
22	What the-?!
23	Kountess safe!
24	Happy dance! Happy dance!
25	What does she think she's playing at?!
26	Hey! Finch! You're not their countess, remember!
27	Heya, folks! I'm Finch! Tee-hee!
28	Oooooohhh!!!
29	She not your kountess!
30	I is only kountess Tirkin is needing!
31	Kountess?!
32	Two kountess?! But which right one kountess?!
33	Is thats kountess?!
34	No! Small one kountess!
35	Double kountess?
36	Multikountess!!!
37	Oh, come on. It's clearly the one on the right!
38	SILENCE!!!
39	We have kountess pair!
40	Oooooohhh!!!
41	Double sovereign! So happies!
42	Happy happy!
43	Noes! I am kountess! Only one kountess!
44	Rejoice!
45	So many kountess! Brink peace\nto all Tirkin!
46	Tirkin really are the best!
47	Whooooooa!!!
48	Tirkin seem super-duper excited...
49	It would be a tall order trying to rein them in now.
50	Ah, now me remember...
51	Tirkin all complete birdbrain! It easies for Tirkin\nto forget kountess even!
52	That why I did runned away!
53	There, there. It'll all be fine. It'll be fine!
54	What are friends for? I'll clear things up for you\nAND I'll explain to them what happened.
55	Flinch... Oh, Flinch! Much thank, Flinch!
56	It's Finch, not Flinch! But thanks, Omelette.
57	Wrong! My name is Omulette! No to forget!
58	*bumbling* Darn, those Tirkin names sure are hard...
59	Never mind. I won't forget it now.\nPromise you that, Amulet!
60	Omulette! I telling you, Flench, my name\nis Omulette!
61	F-IN-CH, not Flench! Come on, it's not that hard!\nNot like Emulotte!
62	Omulette! Why you always get\nwrong, Fronch!
63	Oooooohhh!!!
64	Look at those stooges. This is getting ridiculous...
65	Can't see this ending any time soon. They don't\nseem to know how to deliver a proper punchline...
qst202411_ms.json
1	Waahh I ate way too much.\nMy tummy is gonna explode.
2	I don't think I'm gonna be able to\nlook at a bowl of fried mice again\nany time soon.
3	Finch mean rice.\nMice were not consumed.
4	Haha, Finch.\nNever change.
5	But you did good. Well done!
6	Well that's because I'm just\nan all-round amazing Blade.
7	You did good too, R...uh, Rex.
8	...Is there something about my\nname that's hard to say, or what?
9	Haha, good old Finch!\nThe forgetfulness is growing on me.
10	It was a job well done, anyway.\nKudos!
11	Thanks, Nina! You too!
12	I, that's not, uh-\nWhatever, I can't be bothered...
13	Hm...\nFinch's memory hasn't improved.
14	Still, you did well. Bravo.
15	Thanks, Morodge!
16	You're most welcome.\nI also feel like I should remind you\nof my name. It's Mòrag.
17	Ah Finch, you lovable birdbrain you.
18	But you did good today,\nand that's a fact. Congrats!
19	Thanks, Zeke! Congrats to both of us!
20	So I realized this some time ago,\nbut how come you never get my\nname wrong?
21	I should probably be flattered, but\nit almost feels like not being invited\nto a party...
qst202501_ms.json
1	Something the matter, Zeke?
2	Take a look over there.\nSomething's clearly not right.
3	Those are artificial Blades...
4	So many too!\nWhy they all gathered here?
5	I can identify no regular pattern to their\nmovements. Most likely their command\nsystems are no longer functional.
6	They don't have any orders, but they're\njust gathering here on their own?
7	Is that even possible?
8	Is this some kind of...berserk state?
9	Perhaps not quite so simple, but that\nunderstanding will suffice.
10	A search of the area indicates\nthat a total of 67 artificial Blades\nare active nearby.
11	If we leave the situation unaddressed,\nit's highly likely that more artificial\nBlades shall emerge.
12	Considering all available options, the\nmost prudent course of action would\nbe to eliminate them all right now.
13	You want us to fight these things?\nAll of them?! Are you crazy?!
14	KOS-MOS is right, though...\nThere's no telling what might happen\nif we just leave them like this.
15	We should scrap them before they\ncause any harm.
16	Hey, KOS-MOS. D'you think we can\nactually beat all these things?
17	It is possible.
18	With this number of enemies, the\nprobability of our complete defeat\nis under 12%.
19	Hoooold on, that doesn't sound\nlike a sure thing!
20	It is difficult to predict what may\nhappen during combat.
21	This probability seems within the\nbounds of acceptable risk for\ncombat-related activity.
22	You're scarily calm about this stuff,\nyou know that?
23	The more Blades enter a berserk state,\nthe higher the risks will become.
24	Please give the order to commence\ncombat as soon as possible.
25	All right, let's do this then!\nHere goes nothing!
qst202502_ms.json
1	Confirming increase of enemy activity.\nAwaiting permission to continue combat.
2	No, it's no good.\nWe'll never get through them all.
3	KOS-MOS, it seems best to\nwithdraw and regroup for now.
4	If we withdraw now, we risk major\ndamage to multiple locations.
5	Total annihilation of hostile units\nwould be optimum at present.
6	Girl, there are too many of them.\nThat's pretty clear.
7	Yeah. Mess up, and we're the ones\nwho are going to get annihilated.
8	There should be no problem.\nAll allies, please move away from me for a moment.
9	Scanning for enemy targets.
10	Locked on to all hostile unit signatures\nin World Tree vicinity.
11	Releasing safety lock.
12	KOS-MOS?
13	Phase switch ordnance, activate.
14	Confirming 75% reduction of enemy capability.
15	Initiating neutralization of remaining enemy capability.
16	[ML:undisp]...
17	Rex. Is something wrong?
18	Ah...No...\nGo ahead! Initiate...erm...neutralization!
qst202503_ms.json
1	92% of enemy forces neutralized.\nRemaining enemy forces incapable\nof proceeding with combat.
2	Any risk of reinforcements?
3	A search of the area reveals no sign\nof new units emerging.
4	I...incredible...\nWe really take out all those enemies...
5	You say "we"... Mostly it was down to\nthat crazy power of KOS-MOS's.
6	It really was crazy powerful.\nI've never seen anything like it.
7	I merely selected the optimal course\nof action after analyzing all alternatives.
8	Was my solution excessive?
9	No, no...you did fine.
10	Yeah, if it weren't for you we'd\nnever have beaten that lot!
11	Thank you very much.
12	That attack you used, though...\nI wouldn't be surprised if it was\ndetected in neighboring countries.
13	Yeah, I reckon that light will have\nbeen visible from Tantal and\nMor Ardain at least.
14	Um, so have we accidentally caused\na bit of an international commotion?
15	The national leaders may need to\nbe warned about these artificial\nBlades, as well.
16	Perhaps our next course of\naction should be to report in to\nKing Eulogimenos.
17	Yeah, we'd better explain ourselves\nand clear up any misunderstandings.
18	My old man can get pretty antsy.\nLet's head to Theoscaldia Palace\nand set his mind at ease.
qst202504_ms.json

qst202505_ms.json
1	I see...then the light that was reported\ncoming from the World Tree was an\nattack performed by this Blade?
2	It is quite difficult to believe that a\nsingle Blade could produce such\nremarkable levels of energy...
3	You got that right. I saw it myself,\nand I still had trouble believing it!
4	But it's the truth.
5	Were it not for KOS-MOS's attack,\nwe would all have been defeated by\nthose rogue artificial Blades.
6	Hmmm... Well, as long as you have\nthat power safely under control,\nI suppose it is not a problem.
7	Thank you for your explanation.
8	Regarding the artificial Blades, they\nare indeed a worrying development.
9	They are capable of flight, yes?\nIt seems difficult to guarantee that\nthey will remain on the World Tree.
10	There is a very real possibility that\nberserk artificial Blades could end up\ndescending upon nearby nations.
11	True enough.
12	I will make use of the Tantal military\nand strengthen surveillance around\nthe World Tree.
13	We are most grateful for your wise\ndecision, Your Majesty.
14	However, I feel we will need the\ncooperation of the other nations\nin this matter.
15	What do you say, Lady Mòrag?\nWould you lend me your aid in this?
16	But of course.
17	I will report this incident to Mor Ardain,\nand advise His Majesty the Emperor to\ntake suitable preventative action.
18	You have my thanks, Lady Mòrag.\nI leave the Emperor to you, then.
19	Ah yes, one more thing.\nThere is a request I would like to\nmake of you all.
20	A request?
21	What's all this about, then?
22	Enter, please.
23	Who's that?
24	Someone you know, Shellhead?
25	Hmmmm? Can't say I recognize her...
26	It is a pleasure to meet you, Uncle.\nMy name is Astelle.
27	I hope we will get along!
28	U-Uncle?!\nWhat's going on here, Pops?!
29	This young lady is the daughter\nof your cousin.
30	It is perhaps no surprise that you were\nnot aware of her existence.
31	She was born after you left\nthis country, after all.
32	Strictly speaking, that makes us first\ncousins once removed. I hope you don't\nmind me addressing you as Uncle!
33	U-uh, I dunno what I'm really meant\nto do with a...niece, or cousin, or\nwhatever you are...
34	Well, well, well. Isn't this the sweetest\nlittle family reunion...Uncle?
35	Shaddup, you!
36	Despite her youth, Astelle is something\nof a prodigy who has read all of the\nbooks in the Theosoir library.
37	I fear she may have begun to grow\ntired of living cooped up here in Tantal.\nShe is quite the spirited young lady.
38	Most recently, she expressed a desire\nto explore the Land of Morytha.
39	Of course, I told her I could not\npossibly allow such a dangerous outing.
40	But now she is instead insisting on\nvisiting all the other nations of Alrest,\nbefore they sink entirely.
41	I believe it was you who said I would\ndo well to see the world, Your Majesty.
42	I am simply trying to live up to\nyour expectations.
43	You see what I have to deal with?
44	I don't know where she gets this willful\nnature from, but once she sets her mind\non something, there is no changing it.
45	As such, while I must apologize\nfor the trouble...
46	Might I ask you to take her with you\non your trip to Mor Ardain?
47	Take this girl with us on some\ninternational tour?
48	We're not just traveling for the\nfun of it, you know!
49	I am quite aware of that,\nthank you very much.
50	But you needn't worry about me.\nI won't cause any trouble.
51	In fact, I might be able to assist\nyou in some way, Uncle!
52	E-enough with the uncle thing!\nCan't I at least be, like...a big brother\nor something?!
53	Oh, if you insist. Let's have a\nlovely trip together, "big bro"!
54	...
55	Wow, Shellhead. I didn't know\nyou were into that.
56	Um, my Prince? Forgive my saying so,\nbut...you're creeping me out a little.
57	Oh, for the...!
58	Hey, what's your name?
59	I am KOS-MOS.
60	Cosmos? That's a funny sort of name.
61	You're a Blade, are you?
62	Yes.
63	That's a pretty unusual body\nyou've got there.
64	It's almost like you're part machine.\nAre the machine parts and human parts\nconnected somehow?
65	Do you...have some kind of problem\nwith my body?
66	Problem? No, no problem.
67	Hey, would you mind if I tinkered\naround with the bits inside?
68	I cannot permit that.
69	Even if my Master were to order me\ndirectly, I could not comply.
70	I thought you might say that...\nA shame, a shame.
71	Oh, well! It's going to be a pleasure\ntraveling with you, KOS-MOS!
72	I look forward to it, Astelle.
73	Shall we leave at once, then?
74	Come on, "big bro," you lead the way!
75	Urkkk...
76	What're you making that look for...\n"big bro"?
77	We're leaving you behind, "big bro"!
78	Will you all give it a rest already!
qst202506_ms.json
1	Artificial Blades!
2	Just what we need!
3	Zeke!\nHelp with Astelle's safe withdrawal!
4	No sweat!
5	Locking on to surrounding enemies.\nMaking ballistic calculations. Minimizing damage to urban area.
6	Wonderful! Oh, what a sight!
7	Sincere apologies.\nI was unable to completely annihilate the enemies.
8	No, that's plenty!\nWe got the rest!
qst202507_ms.json
1	You really are incredible, KOS-MOS!\nTell me, where do you get all that\npower from?
2	What's the energy source?\nHow do you replenish it?
3	Can you control the output level?\nDoesn't it put any strain on your\norganic components?
4	My apologies, Astelle.
5	I cannot answer those questions.
6	What? Why not?
7	There is no reason to divulge such\ninformation to anyone other than\nmy Driver.
8	Awww, c'mon, don't be so stingy!\nYou could tell me just a little!
9	Sorry, but no.
10	Not even if I say pretty please?
11	Not even then.
12	I see...
13	Heheh... You really are a funny\none, you know that?
14	Hey, could I have a feel of those\nclothes of yours and stuff?
15	Yes, that should not be a problem.
16	Really?! Nice!
17	I see... So that's how they're made...
18	Hey, could I take this off?
19	I do not have any objections myself...
20	But I understand that exposing the\nunderlying frame would be considered\noffensive to public decency.
21	Really, you think?\nWell, that's probably not an issue.
22	W-wait, Astelle! You can't do that!
23	You can't just take her clothes\noff out here!
24	Huh? But KOS-MOS said she\ndidn't mind...
25	No means no!
26	Now I think we've spent enough time\ndawdling out here. Let's hurry along\nand meet Emperor Niall!
27	Tch... You're no fun...

1	人工ブレイドの件は\n私とゼーリッヒ殿にお任せください
2	皆さんは皆さんの為すべきことを\nお願いします
qst202509_ms.json
1	One moment, please!\nThat Blade will have to wait outside.
2	Are you referring to me?
3	Yes, you.
4	But KOS-MOS is a member\nof our team...
5	That Blade is far too dangerous.\nShe cannot be allowed to have an\naudience with His Majesty.
6	That seems unnecessary to me.\nPlease, stand down.
7	E-Emperor Niall?!
8	B-but if I may, Your Majesty,\nthis Blade was just responsible for...
9	That is quite all right.
10	We would have suffered far greater\ndamage if it were not for her efforts.
11	Besides which, her Driver is more\nthan worthy of our trust.
12	There is no cause for concern.
13	Now please, leave her be.
14	As you wish, Your Majesty!
15	I apologize for all that.
16	I feel the business you bring from King\nEulogimenos may have something to do\nwith the recent artificial Blade attack.
17	Could you explain what you know?
18	I see... Artificial Blades going berserk...
19	I presume that includes the artificial\nBlades that attacked us just now?
20	Yes. They appeared to have lost the\ncapacity to take orders and gone\nberserk, just like those we saw before.
21	Right now, the Titans of Mor Ardain,\nTantal and Uraya are all gathered\naround the World Tree.
22	There is a real danger that the artificial\nBlades Torna released upon the Tree\ncould attack these nearby nations.
23	Hmm... I think I understand\nthe situation now.
24	We may have been lucky enough to\navoid any major damage so far, but this\nis not a threat we can simply ignore.
25	We will work with Tantal and Uraya\nto find a solution to this problem.
26	Thank you for your understanding.
27	No need to thank me.
28	Compared to the efforts you have\nput in, I have done precious little.
29	The least I can do is take care of this\nsituation while you focus on the tasks\nyou must attend to.
30	Yes, Your Majesty!\nIn that case, we will take our leave.
qst202510_ms.json
1	Hey, big bro!
2	What is it?
3	You're all done with your job here\nnow, right?
4	I guess so...we reported what we\ncame here to report.
5	Take me to the Land of Morytha, then!
6	Not a chance.
7	Why not? You're free to go where\nyou want now, right?
8	Like hell we're gonna take you to\na dangerous place like that!
9	I thought you already gave up\non that idea after my old man\ntold you no, anyway?
10	"Gave up" is such a strong word.
11	I asked him to let me travel all of\nAlrest, and he said yes to that!
12	So naturally that means I can go to\nthe Land of Morytha now, right?
13	That's some pretty strained logic.
14	You're pretty cunning for such\na little lass.
15	Very promising young mind.
16	C'mon, you know you want to!\nTake me to the Land of Morytha!
17	I ain't budging!\nYou can come up with all the silly\nloopholes you like, no still means no!
18	Ughhh...you're so useless!\nYou stubborn prodigal old man!
19	Prodigal old...?! That's pretty rich,\ncoming from the likes of you!
20	Why do you want to go to\nMorytha so bad, anyway?
21	It's not exactly what I'd call\na fun place to visit.
22	You just don't appreciate it properly.\nJust to glimpse its landscape would be\nan immensely valuable experience!
23	And besides, it's a treasure trove of\npotential discoveries! So many things\nyou'd never find anywhere else!
24	Initially, I just wanted to see the place,\nbut as it turns out...there's something\nI really want to find there.
25	You don't understand what you're\ntalking about!
26	The place is crawling with dangerous\nmonsters, you realize that?
27	You're a kid without even a Blade to\ndefend yourself. They'd gobble you up\nin two seconds flat.
28	How're you planning to search for\nanything in a place like that?
29	Then send KOS-MOS to protect me.
30	With her around, I'd be totally safe.\nWouldn't I?
31	Where do you get off demanding\nstuff like that?!
32	The King told you to protect me,\ndidn't he?
33	Sure, but he didn't tell us to\nindulge your crazy ideas!
34	I'm going whether you like it or not!\nYou can't stop me, Uncle!
35	Not happening. End of story!
36	Hey, what do you think, KOS-MOS?\nYou'll come with me, won't you?
37	I will obey whatever orders\nI am given.
38	See? KOS-MOS says she doesn't mind!
39	However, my first duty is to\nprotect my master.
40	Protecting you would necessarily\nbe a lower-priority task.\nIs that acceptable?
41	Huh?
42	There, you see?
43	You're not KOS-MOS's Driver, so you\ndon't get to drag her around wherever!
44	Now quit being a stubborn little brat,\nand hurry on home to Tantal!
45	Y-you're wrong, all right?!
46	I may not be her Driver, but\nKOS-MOS is my friend!
47	KOS-MOS will protect me!\nI know she will!
48	Give it a rest already!
49	It's like watching two children fight...
50	Listen, Zeke, there's no point\nstanding around arguing.
51	It seems pretty clear Astelle isn't\ngoing to back down any time soon.
52	Why don't we just give her a quick\nlook at the Land of Morytha and then\nbring her straight back?
53	Seriously? I can't drag you guys all\nthe way down there just to indulge\nthe whims of some stubborn little girl...
54	It's not so much trouble. We owe\nHis Majesty a favor, anyway.
55	But Astelle, if things look even the\nslightest bit dangerous, we're taking\nyou straight out of there. Got that?
56	Sounds fine by me!
57	Shall we get going, then, KOS-MOS?
qst202511_ms.json
1	Hmm. They seem to be having fun.
2	Yeah...
3	Looking at them now, they almost\nseem like a great team.
4	No...it's not this one either...
5	Oh, where is it...?!\nI was so sure I'd find it here...
6	Astelle, are you looking for something?
7	Huh?\nAh...erm...
8	If you tell me what your objective is,\nI can scan the surrounding area for it.
9	This will markedly increase\nthe likelihood of success.
10	I'm sure that's true,\nbut I need to keep this secret.
11	I promise to tell you afterwards, though!
12	Understood.
13	Ah! There it is!
14	KOS-MOS!\nLook! Look!
15	Beware!
16	Astelle! Leg it!
17	Gyaaa!
18	KOS-MOS?
19	Are you unhurt?
20	Hey, you need to be a bit more careful, KOS-MOS!\nWhat if you'd have hurt yourself?
21	It's OK.\nPlease do not worry about me.
22	And, more urgently, please conceal\nyourself behind me for a moment.
23	I will take care of this swiftly.
24	You'd better not get hurt, KOS-MOS!\nBut you'd better not lose, either!
25	Incompatible orders received.\nBut, orders acknowledged.
26	Adjusting priority order of prime directives.\nPrioritizing orders from Astelle.

1	KOS-MOS!\nAre you OK?!\nYou're not hurt, are you?
2	I am quite all right.\nAre you unhurt, Astelle?
3	Yeah, I'm fine!
4	Not a scratch on me, thanks to you.
5	That is a relief to hear.
6	Um, KOS-MOS... I'm sorry!
7	It's all my fault that you got\ndragged into this mess...
8	I didn't mean for this to happen...
9	There is no need for concern.\nProtecting you is what I am here for.
10	But...
11	So, you get it now?
12	When you act selfish, you're not just\nendangering yourself. People who care\nabout you could get hurt, too.
13	Maybe you'll think twice before\ndemanding to come to a place like\nthis again.
14	Yeah... I'm really sorry, guys!
15	No need for that. You've already\nbeen through enough here.
16	As long as you understand,\nthat's all that matters.
17	Oh yeah, did you find what you\nwere looking for in the end?
18	Uh-huh. Look, I have it right here.
19	This is...some kind of machine part?
20	Yeah.
21	Listen, KOS-MOS...
22	When we get back to Tantal, there's\none more thing I'd like you to do...
23	Would you be OK with that?
24	You're still not done making demands?
25	That's not it! There's just...something\nI want to give to KOS-MOS.
26	So KOS-MOS, I'd like you to\ncome to my room.
27	I promise I won't cause any more\ntrouble! So...please?
28	What do you think, Zeke?
29	Well...I guess there's no harm in that.
30	Really?! Thanks, big bro!
31	I swear, you really pick your times\nto act all cutesy...
32	Are you fine with this too, KOS-MOS?
33	Yes. I see no problem.
34	Then let's head on back to Tantal.
35	My room's in the Hall of Reception.\nI'll see you there!
qst202513_ms.json
1	Welcome to my room!
2	Well, I don't actually live here as such.\nIt's just where I'm staying while I'm\nhere in Theoscaldia.
3	Isn't this some kind of storeroom?
4	It doesn't need to be fancy.\nA dingy old place like this is\nperfect for my experiments.
5	Dingy, she says...
6	Now, KOS-MOS, you just wait there\na moment while I get everything ready.
7	As you wish, Astelle.
8	I just need to put the final touches on...
qst202514_ms.json
1	Sorry for the wait, KOS-MOS.\nThis is what I wanted to give you.\nIt's a present!
2	This is for me?
3	Listen, while I was observing you,\nI noticed you didn't always have\nperfect control of your power.
4	It can't be easy to keep powers that\nstrong under control all the time.
5	But if you use this device, it should\nbe much easier to manage.
6	You'll be able to fight without worrying\nabout keeping yourself in check all the\ntime. I think it'll be really useful!
7	Astelle...!
8	Listen, KOS-MOS.
9	Abilities as powerful as yours are\na very dangerous thing to have.
10	But I think you probably have them\nfor a reason. The world needs that\nkind of strength right now.
11	King Eulogimenos and Emperor Niall\nboth seem to think it's fine as long as\nyour Driver keeps you in check...
12	But who wants to rely on a Driver\nfor everything, right?
13	If you master the use of your own\npowers, you can become the ultimate\nBlade! Maybe even save Alrest!
14	Don't worry, I'm sure you'll do the\nright thing. And I'm your best friend,\nso I should know!
15	When did we become best friends...?
16	You just keep supporting these guys\nin their mission, OK, KOS-MOS?
17	I have a feeling if you help Rex and\nNia and Mòrag and my uncle, you'll be\nable to save all of Alrest someday!
18	Understood.
19	Are you sure it is all right for me to\naccept this for nothing, though?
20	It's a gift from your best friend, right?\nSure you should accept it.
21	Well, she's apparently your best friend!\nWho turns down a gift from a bestie?
22	When a good friend offers a gift,\nyou should accept it gladly.
23	You two are good friends now, yeah?\nThen you should accept her gift!
24	Thank you, Astelle.\nI promise to make good use of it.
25	Thanks! Come by and visit\nany time, OK?
26	I promise I will visit.\nWe are friends, after all.
27	Best friends, you mean!
qst202601_ms.json
1	Ah, you return, my wayward child.
2	Just passing by.\nI wasn't particularly keen on seeing\nyour old mug again, Dad.
3	You never change, do you, Zeke?
4	Well, no matter. As it happens,\nI have a request to ask of you.
5	Oh, yeah?
6	There's a new type of monster we've\nnever seen before in the Genbu Titan.
7	It's been roaming around the Amphoret\nPillar for now, but there's no telling\nwhen it may decide to attack Theosoir.
8	Why d'you need us? Can't you get the\nmilitary to do something about it?
9	I could, but with the Aegis and Herald\nat your disposal, having you handle it\nwould keep casualties to a minimum.
10	Is that an order, Your Majesty?
11	No, not an order. It is a request...\nthat we may protect the lives of the\npeople.
12	What do you say, Herald?\nWould you lend us your power?
13	As you know, Your Majesty,\nI once ran out of control and\ntried to destroy your kingdom.
14	If I am made to fight again in\nclose proximity, there's every\npossibility that...that I'll...
15	That's enough. I told you before, you're\nnot the same as you once were.
16	And above all, Rex believes in you.\nDo not forget that.
17	And above all, Nia believes in you.\nDo not forget that.
18	And above all, Zeke believes in you.\nDo not forget that.
19	And above all, Mòrag believes in you.\nDo not forget that.
20	I understand that...but...
21	If you understand that, then what need\nhave you to be despondent?
22	...
23	Look at it this way. If you truly feel\nresponsible for your actions, then think\nof this as a means of repentance.
24	And what greater service could be\ndone than protecting the lives of\nthe kingdom?
25	Your Majesty...
26	Herald, we beseech you. Help us.
27	Go with Rex and use your powers\nto save Tantal.
28	Go with Nia and use your powers\nto save Tantal.
29	Go with Zeke and use your powers\nto save Tantal.
30	Go with Mòrag and use your powers\nto save Tantal.
31	Understood. I will assist you to the\nutmost of my ability...
qst202602_ms.json
1	We're back, Dad. You were right.\nThose Herridot Laias were no pushover.
2	Oh, you've defeated them already?\nAll that jaunting around the world may\nhave actually made a man of you, Zeke!
3	Thanks, but I really don't need your\nempty compliments.
4	Still as cynical as ever though, I see...
5	Splendid work to you too, Herald.\nAllow me to commend you for your\nefforts.
6	No, I could never have done it alone.\nNot without Rex.
7	No, I could never have done it alone.\nNot without Nia.
8	No, I could never have done it alone.\nNot without Zeke.
9	No, I could never have done it alone.\nNot without Mòrag.
10	Is that so...? Then it appears I made the\nright decision to entrust Herald to you.
11	I trust you will continue to keep her\nunder your wing?
12	Of course, Your Majesty. She's our\nfriend. We promise we'll take good\ncare of her!
13	Good, good.\nWell now, the matter of ensuring\nTantal's safety has been seen to...
14	But as it happens, there's more to\nthis than it first seemed.
15	Come on, Dad, don't beat about the\nbush. Spit it out.
16	You got something else for us to do?
17	You catch on quickly, Pandoria.
18	It's about the Herridot Laias. You\ndefeated one pair of them, but it seems\nthere are more, this time in Uraya.
19	Huh? In Uraya...?
20	Queen Raqura has put out a plea for\nhelp. Given your experience, I would\nlike to send you to assist her.
21	The Urayan army already have their\nhands full with it as it is.
22	Yeah, Herridot Laias aren't something\nyour average Driver can deal with...
23	What do you say, Herald? Will you\naccompany them?
24	What reason have I to refuse a personal\nrequest from His Majesty?
25	If it is for the good of Alrest,\nthen perhaps it will serve to\natone for my sins...
26	Now, now, do not burden yourself\nso. I'm sure Queen Raqura will be\ndelighted to hear this.
27	I'd like you to head now to Fonsa\nMyma Port. You will be given further\ninstructions upon your arrival.
28	Affirmative.
29	Well then, godspeed.
qst202603_ms.json
1	Welcome. We've been expecting you.
2	Whoa, I didn't expect you to be\nmeeting us personally, Your Majesty!
3	Tora feeling like Very Important Nopon!
4	We are honored that you would come\nto speak with us in person.
5	Raise your head, Flamebringer.
6	It's I who should apologize for meeting\nyou in such a place.
7	But I'm afraid time is of the essence.\nWe can't afford luxuries.
8	Could you inform us of the situation?
9	I was just about to.
10	At present, we've confirmed two\nHerridot Laias in Uraya. We've had to\nmake three strategic retreats already.
11	Three retreats?! Sheesh...
12	Indeed. Our army has a mere handful\nof Drivers, so we haven't been able to\nput up much of a fight thus far.
13	We recruited the Merc Group as well,\nbut they failed to subjugate it, being\nan unfamiliar species.
14	We just don't have the means to deal\nwith them with our current capabilities.
15	That is why we entreated you to bring\nthe Aegis and any other competent\nBlades you may have to help us.
16	Gotcha. Time to bust us up some\nHerridot Laias then!
17	It would be most appreciated.
18	The Herridot Laias are presently\non the far side of Gullet Pass.
19	It will be done.
20	Herald...think you're up to this?
21	Of course.
22	Let's dispatch the enemy at the\nearliest opportunity.
qst202604_ms.json
1	We have conquered the enemy,\nYour Majesty. You need fear no\nlonger.
2	Truly, I am grateful to you, from the\nbottom of my heart.
3	Where are all these monsters coming\nfrom, though?
4	First Tantal, now here...\nIt's certainly a cause for concern.
5	The introduction of foreign species\nto endemic regions could wildly\ndisrupt their ecosystems.
6	We've already identified where\nthe Laias are coming from.
7	Really?!
8	Yes, a messenger from Temperantia\narrived while you were out fighting.
9	Laias appear to have been spawning at\nan alarming rate at a place called\nXataris Spring in Temperantia.
10	Temperantia, eh?
11	So they're born in Temperantia and\nthen migrate to other Titans by air...
12	So they could be causing trouble in\nother countries too? This is bad...
13	Indeed. It seems that to address the\nheart of the matter, we'll have to rid\nTemperantia of its Laias.
14	Going up against those things isn't\nhalf exhausting, though...
15	But we have to do this.\nNo one else can!
16	True enough. Shall we, then?
17	Sorry Herald, looks like our job's\nstill not over yet.
18	That is fine by me...
19	The future of Alrest is in your hands.\nMy thoughts go with you.
20	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]...!
21	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]What...?\nWhat is this strange feeling...?
22	Don't tell me my power is...
23	[ML:Feeling ]Hey, Herald! We're leaving!
24	Ah, yes! Coming!
qst202605_ms.json
1	Herald!
2	Comrades!
3	How'd you end up here?
4	You've led us on a merry dance and\nno mistake!
5	Apologies.
6	Herald... When you split off from us...\nYou did that to protect us, didn't you?
7	Indeed.
8	But it looks like you're all right now.\nYou're not acting weird like before.
9	Yes, you seem to be\nback to your old self.
10	OK! Shall we move out together?
11	Alas... I cannot.
12	I want you to leave me to my fate.
13	Are you concerned that you'll\nrun rampant again?
14	Correct.
15	Hey c'mon. What happened\nbefore was our fault.
16	Yeah. We aren't going to let you stew\nin your own juices, Herald.
17	But...
qst202606_ms.json
1	How are there so many?!
2	You have got to be joking...
3	It appears Queen Raqura was right.\nThere are an irregular number of\nthem here.
4	Even for the great Zekenator,\nthis is kind of a tall order...
5	But we can't leave them like this.\nWe can't just let them run rampant\nall over the world!
6	With you there, chum. It's time we\nnipped this in the bud.
7	All right, then... Let's go!\nHerald, back me up!
8	...
9	Herald?
10	Yes... I'm ready.
11	Let's begin...
qst202607_ms.json
1	Yeah, things aren't looking so good here...\nLet's retreat for now and regroup!
2	...Affirmative.
3	Wha-?!
4	It doesn't look like they're going to let this one go.
5	Oh crud. We're completely surrounded!
6	And they just keep on coming!
7	...Do not fear. I have sworn on my life to protect you.
8	Herald!
9	Hey, there's no way you can take on that many enemies\non your own! What are you trying to pull?!
10	I had hoped I would never have to use this again, but...
11	There's no other way.
12	Goodbye.
13	Uaaaaaaaaarrrgh!!!
14	Huh?!
15	Not good. Move it!
16	Herald, stop! That's enough!
17	Stop fighting!
18	...Urgh...
19	Can she not control the power?!
20	Aaaaaaahhhhh!!!
21	Herald!
22	Herald, are you all right?
23	That was one heck of a light show\nyou gave us there, madam.
24	A few seconds more and we'd have been toast too...
25	Can you walk?
26	Agh!
27	?!
28	That's enough...
29	Herald?!
30	Stay away!
31	?!
32	At this rate...I'm afraid...my power will...
33	It's just...going to destroy...everything...
34	I...I have to go...somewhere...\nSomewhere...no one will ever find me...
35	Herald, wait!
36	Where are you going?!
37	Stay where you are!!!
38	Just...leave me alone...
39	Herald...
40	I guess that's the berserk state we were\nwarned about...
41	Most likely.
42	Yeah, that's probably exactly how it went down \nwhen she wrecked the temple in Theosoir.
43	And after we swore that we'd\nnever let it happen again...
44	Yeah, that was nobody's fault but our own.\nWe pushed the girl too far.
45	...
46	We're going to find her.
47	Naturally. There's no way we're\nleaving her alone out there.
48	She's out there on her own because she\ndoesn't want to cause us trouble.
49	We can't just abandon her like that.
50	Too right. She's suffered long enough.\nShe needs a right royal cheering up.
51	Come on, let's go before she gets too far!
52	Right! Let's go!
53	Having said that, Herald does have wings.
54	First we'll have to find out where she's headed.
qst202608_ms.json
1	...Ugh-!
2	Herald?
3	You all right?
4	Stop! Don't come near me!
5	Ah!
6	See, here's the thing...
7	We can't ignore a friend when we see them suffering!
8	Huh?!
9	Hey, that body...
10	You can't keep your power in check, can you?
11	Enough... Just...go... Run...
12	Uwaaaaaaaaagh!
13	Herald, get a hold of yourself!
14	Guuhhhhhh!
15	Herald!
16	Aaaaaahhhhh!
17	It looks like our only option is to\nrestrain her by force.
18	Yeah...to stop history from repeating itself!
qst202609_ms.json
1	Herald... Are you all right?
2	Looks like we pulled the plug on rampage mode.
3	Smash my Core Crystal. It's...it's the only way.
4	Huh?!
5	This is the only chance you'll get...
6	The burden of my sin is already...too much to bear!
7	Shut the hell up!
8	We'd never do something like that, ever!
9	Then I will run rampant again...
10	and next time, innocents will suffer...
11	I don't want to hurt anyone any more...
12	If you really care about me...\nthen please, end it...
13	Screw that!
14	I can't possibly agree to those terms either.
15	Why...?
16	Don't you remember what King Eulogimenos\nsaid? He entrusted you to us.
17	So that we would take care of you.
18	Whether you go berserk or not,\nit doesn't change a thing.
19	Listen to Rex. The days of worrying about yourself\nrunning out of control are over.
20	We'll stop you as many times as it takes.
21	So don't ever think that you're better\noff gone.
22	You've already helped us so much.\nNow we get to help you in return.
23	That's what friends are for, right?
24	Friends...
25	So, Herald? You get what we mean now?
26	So...you're saying you'd let me stay with you?
27	Need you even ask?
28	Thank you...
qst202610_ms.json
1	I thought that my existence as\na weapon could cause nothing but\npain to those around me.
2	But after what you told me, Rex,\nI began to reconsider that.
3	But after what you told me, Nia,\nI began to reconsider that.
4	But after what you told me, Zeke,\nI began to reconsider that.
5	But after what you told me, Mòrag,\nI began to reconsider that.
6	I realize now that I could use my power\nnot to destroy, but to protect.
7	That I could use my powers for the\ngood of the people.
8	I wonder if it's strange of me to\nthink so...
9	No way, not at all!
10	I'll help you every step of the way,\nHerald. As a Driver... No, as a friend!
11	Nothing strange about that.
12	I'll help you every step of the way,\nHerald. As a Driver... No, as a friend.
13	I think it's very admirable.
14	Allow me to help you with that goal.\nAs a Driver... No, as a friend.
15	The only thing that's strange is you\nthinking it's strange, girl.
16	I should let you know that I'm 110%\nbehind you on this one. As a Driver...\nNo...as a friend.
17	Thank you...
18	I'll do my best to live up to your\nexpectations, Rex.
19	I'll do my best to live up to your\nexpectations, Nia.
20	I'll do my best to live up to your\nexpectations, Zeke.
21	I'll do my best to live up to your\nexpectations, Mòrag.
qst202701_ms.json
1	Me-meh? Friend looking fidgety.\nSomething wrong?
2	Maybe look for someone?
3	Yes, indeed.
4	Daughterpon of Mamumu recently get\ninto habit of leaving house late at night.
5	Mamumu find this worrying, so\nme look for her in all sort of places.
6	I think any parent would get worried\nif their daughter was skulking about...
7	Spoken like a true master of skulking,\nMy Prince!
8	Gwahahahaha!
9	W-what so funny, meh?
10	What you're doing, my friend,\nis called mollycoddling.
11	Mamumu not coddle anything!\nJust do what any parent do!
12	Hah. In my younger days, the night\nwas always my playground...
13	You say younger days, but didn't you\nliterally get awoken, like, yesterday?
14	Yeah, aren't you basically a newborn?
15	Oh, Pandy, Zeke, you don't get it!\nThese memories don't rest in my head...
16	They are carved into my very core.
17	...Right. Yeah. OK.
18	Even as a Nopon, did you never\nin your younger days yield yourself\nto the night and run wild?
19	Mmeh, admittedly me did go out a lot\nwhen younger, get into more than a\nfew scrapes...
20	Then why not allow your daughter her\nproclivities? If you try to bind her, she\nmay rebel even more... Not unlike me.
21	No, this situation completely different!
22	What's different?
23	Me manage to discover every night,\nwhen daughterpon go out, she go take\npart in some weird gathering...
24	A 'gathering'? Oho, better and better!
25	Better-schmetter!
26	Weird apocalypse cult called\nHarbingers of Eschapon now popular\nand daughterpon may be one of them!
27	Apocalypse cult called...\nHarbingers of Eschapon, huh...?
28	You know 'em, Vale?
29	Nah, but I have to say the name is\nrockin'!
30	Tora think so too! Very cool sound!
31	Poppi unclear on derivation, but\nhave to agree it sound edgy and cool.
32	Right? Right?!\nYou guys get me!
33	This is too much even for me...
34	Um, can we go back to where there's\nan apocalypse cult out there...?
35	The chum's got a point.\nWe should check it out!
36	You would?!\nThank you!
37	First of all, let's find out what this\nwhole cult thing is about.
38	Let's talk to people and\ngather some intel!
qst202702_ms.json
1	They nothing but big nuisance, meh!\nMe at end of tether!
2	Littlepon Nopon meet at night on\nrooftop in Beraf Industry Ward and\nchant weird chant, meh!
3	It give me goosebumps!\nMe really wish they'd take it elsewhere.
qst202703_ms.json
1	An apocalypse cult?\nCan't say I've ever heard of them.
2	You say it's popular with Nopon?
3	Merciful Architect, I have no clue what\nthey're thinking.
4	I mean, it doesn't exactly sound\nwholesome, now does it?
qst202704_ms.json
1	Eschaponism?
2	No, that doesn't ring any bells.
3	But I did notice that young Nopon\nhave been up to something lately.
4	Whatever it is, I bet it's fun!
qst202705_ms.json
1	Harbingers of Eschapon, meh?
2	Mmme-meh... No, Sumomo not know.\nSorry!
3	What Sumomo do know is great\nbaking school called Boulanger\nMarathon!
4	...Sumomo realize that not helpful\nas soon as Sumomo speak...
qst202706_ms.json
1	Apocalypse cult?
2	Oh yeah, some of my Nopon friends\ninvited me to come along!
3	They said everyone makes a circle,\nand then they all lie down and sing!
4	They call that the Purpure Altar...
5	It sounded awfully fun and cool and...!\nBut the leader said I couldn't come\nin the end, 'cos I'm not a Nopon...
qst202707_ms.json
1	Friends!\nWhat news?
2	Well, we've done some asking around.
3	The cult meets on some rooftop\nat night, performing a ritual called\nthe Purpure Altar.
4	Meh-meh-meh...
5	They form a circle, lie down,\nthen chant some kind of spell.
6	...
7	Anybody else think they sound like\na mega relaxed bunch? No? Just me?
8	Sound like mega dangerous bunch,\nmeh!
9	Most Nopon not into religion stuff!\nSo for littlepon to chant spells is\nperversion of natural order!
10	Is that right?
11	Friends, Mamumu beg you!
12	If daughterpon involved with lunatics,\nplease convince her to come back!
13	She not listen to what Mamumu say...
14	But if words come from you friends,\nshe maybe more open-minded!
15	Understood.\nWe'll see what we can do.
16	Really?!\nThanks to friends, oh, thanks!
17	You'll come too, won't you, Vale?
18	...All right, sure. Beating up a hoodlum\ngirl to make her change her ways was\non my bucket list anyway.
19	...I think we'll try talking first.
20	Yeah, yeah...\nWhat's the kid's name, then?
21	Name is Mimin!
22	Great!\nWe'll have Mimin saved by lunchtime!
qst202708_ms.json
1	Is this the place?
2	Wow... I thought they were just goofing\naround, but this looks like serious\ncult business.
3	I wonder what it is they're chanting...
4	Beats Tora...
5	Well, anyhoo. Shall we throw\na spanner in the works?
6	I almost hate to butt in...\nBut we need to find Mimin somehow.\nLet's go find someone to talk to!
qst202709_ms.json
1	Mimin? Me not familiar.
2	Then again, cult membership swell\nrecently, so me not really keep up\nwith each and every neophyte.
3	Now, if friends could move on?\nMust not interrupt our sublime\nRite of Erasure.

1	Me not know Nopon name Mimin.
2	But Zonori is new to Eschaponism.\nFriends better ask more senior member.
3	Ah... But we now in middle of perform\ndread rite, so maybe wait till after?
qst202711_ms.json
1	What is with commotion?\nGermon in middle of important ritual!
2	Please do not to disturb.
3	It not long now until our Lord Moe\nis reborn...
4	Lord Moe?
5	Ohh, right, this is meant to be a\ndemon-summoning ritual. I forgot.
6	Yes! We use Rite of Erasure to summon\nawesome Nopon demon, Lord Moe!
7	Rite of Erasure...\nIt's got a good ring to it.
8	And why is it you're trying to revive\nLord Moe?
9	It because sadness cover Alrest.
10	War, poverty, discrimination, cruelty...
11	and of course death of Titans...
12	This world now in unstoppable decline!
13	Well then!
14	We Nopon summon great demon\nLord Moe!
15	He make Alrest reborn!
16	So basically, you want Nopon to\ninherit the world?
17	Wow...\nYou're dumber than you look.
18	There nothing dumb about Germon!
19	Indol... Mor Ardain... Uraya...\nAnd of course Tantal...
20	Every country only think of own profit!
21	Nopon littlepon look on human races\nand feel great disappointment.
22	Humans think Nopon are cute pets\nor grubby busybodies...
23	They disrespect Nopon!\nThey corrupt our world!
24	That why we raise voices to Lord Moe,\nto return dignity to oppressed Nopon...
25	To destroy world\nand be reborn in new, better one!
26	No, see...\nI wasn't calling your cause dumb,\nor making light of oppression.
27	What I'm saying is, it's dumb to pin\nall your hopes on something that\ndoesn't actually exist.
28	If you wanna change the world, then\ndon't look to gods or demons to do it\nfor you! Go and change it yourself!
29	But in the end, you're not even trying.\nYou're just throwing everything away...
30	You're like a little kid having a tantrum!
31	Meh-meh-meh!\nGermon will not be insulted like this!
32	But Lord Moe descend any minute now!
33	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Gwahahaha!
34	Now! See how world change!
qst202712_ms.json
1	A monster?!
2	You're seriously telling me the summoning worked?!
3	Ohohoho...\nFascinating coincidence.
4	Ohhhhhh, destroyer of worlds!\nDemon reborn, descended to Alrest!
5	Our wishes come true, meh!
6	Meh-mehhh!
7	This looks bad!\nEverybody, out!
8	Ohh, Your Dark Majesty!\nLead your servants into a new world!
9	Save us from this\nwarped and corrupted one!
10	Enough rubbernecking!
11	What you do?!\nNo interfering with work of god!!
12	God?! Are you crazy or just plain dumb?
13	You think that is a 'Dark Majesty'?
14	That's just some shitty old monster\ncome to feast on idiot Nopon.
15	Meh-meh?!
16	Ohoho...\nLook closely.
17	You're afraid of that guy...
18	when really it's my dark majesty that\nshould be giving you nightmares!
qst202713_ms.json
1	Meh-meh-meh!\nWhy?! Why, meh?!
2	Germon only want to change this\ngood-for-nothing rotten world!
3	So why you... Why you have to...
4	That there wasn't any sort of demon,\njust your garden variety monster.
5	It saw you on an empty stomach\nand decided to get a snack.
6	I can guarantee it wasn't trying\nto save the world or anything.
7	Me-mehhh...
8	But, hey...\nDo you really want to save the world?
9	Yes!\nThat why Germon assemble young\nNopon who still hope for better Alrest.
10	Well, you've got charisma,\nso there's that at least.
11	Next time, how 'bout you try changing\nthe world yourself, instead of asking\ndemons for help?
12	For my money, that's even cooler.
13	Meh-me-meh...
14	Sorry to interrupt your love-in, but\ndid a Nopon called Mimin come here?
15	Mimin?\nThere no littlepon by that name here.
16	Ugh, so where did she go...?
17	Maybe she join\nother branch of franchise?
18	...I beg your pardon?
19	You mean there are other groups\ndoing what you've been doing?
20	Precisely.\nGermon represent Ardainian branch.
21	Harbingers of Eschapon comprised\nthree branches, changing world by\nsummoning three demons.
22	Sad to say, management have little\nconfidence in Germon, so this branch\nget weakest demon assignment...
23	To be fair, it's not like you were\nactually summoning anything...
24	So where are the other branches?
25	One is Gormott branch, me hear they\nmeet to perform rite on far end of\nWrecc Marshland.
26	As for other...\nGermon was not told, to reduce\nrisk of information leak.
27	I see...\nThe head of the Gormott branch\nwould know, I suppose.
28	Then we should depart for Gormott,\npost-haste.
29	Right on...
30	We might find Mimin, and if this lot\nis anything to go by, she's bound to\nneed saving from something peckish.
31	OK, let's head out.
32	Please wait!\nGermon greatly impressed by\nfriend's coolness.
33	If it please friend, would friend\nconsider to stay here and lead\nflock of Germon?
34	No way.
35	Why no way?!
36	First, I hate being put on a pedestal.\nSecond, I've no interest in changing\nAlrest.
37	Mmehhh... Then what Germon do...?
38	I told you, didn't I? You can lead 'em,\nyou've proven that. Just use it for\ngood or something.
39	I'm sure you can change the world\nin some way, however small.
40	...Germon understand.\nWe try to start afresh.
41	Germon lead flock to greatness!\nNo gods or demons, only Nopon!
42	Sounds great, guys.\nDo your model best.
43	So. Destination, Gormott,\nfar end of Wrecc Marshland!
qst202714_ms.json
1	Is this...\nthe aftermath of a demon summoning?
2	Nah, I'm pretty sure it's just another\nstarving monster...but this time we\ngot here too late.
3	Me-me-me-meh!\nS-s-stay away!
4	If all Nopon did this, soon there\nwould be none left.
5	Let's go save this one at least!
qst202715_ms.json
1	...What the tuft...?
2	This...\nThis not how it supposed to go!
3	Doraram just...\nMe just want to make world better...
4	But instead of summon demon prince,\nwe get hungry monster attack...
5	Was Doraram wrong...?
6	We're not here to listen to you\nreflect on your wasted life...
7	You really don't need an audience\nfor that.
8	We look for littlepon name Mimin.\nShe not here?
9	Mimin...\nMimin was devout Eschaponist.
10	You say, was...?\nDon't tell Tora hungry hungry monster\neat poor little Mimin?!
11	No no, friend not to worry.
12	Like me say,\nMimin was staunch believer.
13	That why me recommend her\nfor transfer to main branch.
14	Mehhh?!\nMain branch is where?
15	Leftheria...
16	Right now, they probably holding\nbiggest Rite of Erasure in Vault of\nHeroes within Spirit Crucible Elpys.
17	Oh no! If we not go now,\nit maybe too late!
18	All right...
19	There's no choice but to\ncrash their dumb little ritual and\nsave the dumb little Nopon kid.
qst202716_ms.json
1	...M-meh? What happen to ritual?
2	It got canceled.
3	It's no big loss. You could never hope\nto change the world that way, anyway.
4	All you were doing is\nthrowing your lives away.
5	You...
6	Came here to find you,\non your mother's orders.
7	You made your mom sick with worry.\nAnd you caused no end of hassle\nto me and mine...
8	I hope you're sorry.
9	We...are Nopon. With strength\nof Nopon, we can save Alrest...
10	That is what we believed. They said\nwe can change the world, and we\nbelieved we can do anything.
11	But...it was mistake, in the end...\nWe sorry.
12	Hey, I don't wanna hear it.
13	You should be apologizing to your\nmother, not to me. She's the one\nwho's been worrying non-stop.
14	My...mamapon?
15	You get it now?\nI'm not saying you can't rebel.
16	But if you're gonna, you have to be\naware of the consequences and ready\nto take responsibility.
17	Otherwise, you're nothing but\na snotty kid acting out.
18	All right?
19	All right...
20	Well, if it's all right, then hurry up and\nlet's mosey on home. We'll make sure\nyou get there OK.
qst202717_ms.json
1	Not great...
2	What's not great?
3	This ritual... It's entirely unlike the previous ones...\nI can tell they really mean to summon something terrifying...
4	It not look any different to Tora...
5	Yeah, but... Somewhere inside, I can feel it.
6	I believe Vale.\nWe need to stop them, and quick!
7	Oi, you lot!\nRun, now!
8	Leave here at once! Everyone!
9	...Dammit!\nWhat's going on there?!
10	They've all been hypnotized.\nThey can't even hear us from here!
11	Who go there?
12	We in middle of holy-holy rite!\nNo matter who you are, me no let you interfere!
13	Holy rite, my ass!
14	If you don't stop this instant,\nyou'll all be killed!
15	That wonderful!
16	That would be certain first step\nto rebirth in new world!
17	Argh! Idiot... Too far up his own ass to listen.
18	Everyone, over there!
19	The prodigal daughter we'd been looking for!
20	Sorry, old man, but\nwe'll be needing her back!
21	Such action ill-advised.\nRite reach climax any moment now.
22	Girl about to become offering for\nHis Dark Majesty!
23	I will not stand idly by!
24	Meh-heh-heh... You dead-set on stand in our way?\nWant trouble, we happy to oblige.
25	Your corpses also become offering to hasten\ncoming of new world!
26	Feast eyes, meh!\nOur Dark Majesty descend!
27	Meh-mehhhhh!
28	Come, Dark Majesty!\nMake world your plaything, ripe for destru-
29	Meh-?!
30	Whuh-?!
31	Watch out!
32	We'll have to kick that rampaging thing into the middle\nof next week and get everyone to safety!
33	Fully agree.\nIt might be a big job, though...
34	Someone's got to do it.
35	If we leave it like this, it might not stop\ntill the whole world is in ruin...
36	Ohoho... No need for alarm.\nI am a Blade of Darkness, aren't I?
37	My weapon arm has been raring to go\nfor a good long while now...
38	With mine arms I will take you\nexactly where you belong!
39	In hell, to rot!
qst202719_ms.json
1	Mimin!
2	Mamapon...
3	Go on now. It's OK.
4	Mamapon...\nMimin sorry!
5	Sorry for make Mamapon worry!
6	There, there...\nMamapon just glad you OK.
7	Mimin not hurt anywhere?
8	No, Mimin healthy as Armu!\nThanks to Miss Vale and others!
9	Ah, that good...\nThat really good!
10	Mamapon...\nMimin was wrong.
11	Mimin blame problems on others,\nrun away when should have stayed...
12	Mimin should have just\ntalk with Mamapon...!
13	It not entirely fault of Mimin...
14	Mamapon also could have\nlisten to what Mimin say more carefully.
15	...This lesson, I learn from friend here.
16	Hm...
17	Hmm...being a parent looks great, eh?
18	I guess...
19	Everyone in this world has ties,\neven if it's just to one person...
20	Caring for that person is a good thing...
21	Just like with me and my Driver.
qst202720_ms.json
1	Weird apocalypse cult called\nHarbingers of Eschapon now popular\nand daughterpon may be one of them!
2	Me want friends to ask townspeople\nfirst, find out what can find out!
qst202801_ms.json
1	Ooh, I wonder what kind of minerals\nwe might find here!
2	Whaa-!
3	A b-b-b-BUG?!
4	Looks like a dead Parisax or something.
5	Eek!
6	Uh, it moved.
7	Nooooo-!
8	No, get away!\nStay away!
9	That hurt, meh!
10	...Huh?
11	Oh, hey, it's not a bug, just a Nopon!
12	...A...Nopon?
13	How rude, confuse Digidigi for bug.\nFor shame!
14	N-no, I...\nI'm sorry.
15	I have a bit of a problem with bugs...
16	"Bit of problem" is understatement of year...
17	Agate's usually got it together, too.
18	That's an unexpected side of her for sure.
19	I did say I'm sorry...
qst202802_ms.json
1	Hey, uh...\nPardon me...\nAre you all right?
2	Of course me not 'all right'!\nMe got treated horrible!
3	Incidentally, what've you been doing\nin the ground there, guy?
4	Me not 'guy'! That offensive!\nName is Digidigi!
5	And if friends must know, Digidigi\ndo excavation here, day and night,\nin search of new kind of mineral!
6	Digidigi have hunch, see? Feel deep\nin bones that hereabouts, precious\nstone wait to be found...
7	Unfortunately, tunnel sort of collapse,\nand Digidigi get buried alive.
8	But friends re-excavate Digidigi!\nDigidigi grateful!
9	Not at all.\nIt was a happy accident, really...
10	Back up a bit though.\nYou said you were looking for\na new mineral?
11	Indeed!
12	This area have lots of precious stone.
13	Not only that, but can also find\ncrystallized remains of creatures\nfrom ancient time.
14	Digging up bodies sounds a bit yucky\nif you ask me...
15	No way, there's nothing yucky about it!
16	When ancient creatures' bones\nturn to stone or to crystal,\nthey make really beautiful fossils.
17	Is that right? Huh!\nI had no idea.
18	So, Digidigi, what kinds of rocks\nhave you found so far?
19	Friend want to know?\nWell, now, far be it for Digidigi to\ntoot own horn, but...
20	Me discover two new kinds of mineral.
21	Two new kinds?!
22	Yes! Digidigite is one,\nand Himahistone is other.
23	Wow, those are some major minerals!
24	Yeah, even I've heard of Digidigite.
25	They find it here in Uraya sometimes,\nright?
26	Digidigi!\nI also want to discover a new mineral!
27	Please! Teach me the secret of\nmineral discovery!
28	Hmhmhm...\nNormally, Digidigi would never\ndisclose secrets of art, but in this case...
29	Fellow rock hunter cannot be\nbad person! Also, me owe friends\nmy life!
30	So, as exception, me will tell friends\nshortcut on road to become\ngeologist extraordinaire.
31	Shortcut?
32	To find rare mineral, friends can't\njust look like for normal rock.
33	Instead, must seek out\nsuspicious-looking deposits!
34	That's a good point... So far I've only\nlooked in the most obvious places.
35	Then no wonder friend find nothing!\nKey is to search deposits which\nnobody else think to search!
36	Also one other thing. Once friend\nfind rare stone, must confirm mineral is\ntruly new discovery.
37	In Argentum Trade Guild live\njeweler name Misimisi, who also\ndo work as appraiser on side.
38	Misimisi appraise minerals that\nDigidigi excavate also. Then pay\ngood money for said minerals.
39	Misimisi has eye for these things,\nmaybe best in all of Alrest.
40	Wow, OK... So to recap, to find\nrare stones we should check deposits\nthat nobody else would check...
41	and then take them to Misimisi\nin Argentum for appraisal, and\nthat's the best way? All right.
42	Discovery of new minerals is\nbattle against self.
43	Friends cannot give up, but also\ncannot rush. If friends stay true to path,\nsuccess surely follow!
44	Digidigi see great things\nin future of friend Agate.
45	Thanks for the vote of confidence!\nI'll do my best, Master Digidigi!
46	Meheheh...\nThen job of Digidigi is done here,\nand me get back to previous job.
47	What say we go pay a visit\nto Misimisi in Argentum?
48	Sounds like a plan!\nWe should introduce ourselves\nif we're gonna be working together.
qst202803_ms.json
1	You're Misimisi? Hello there!\nWe're here because Digidigi said...
2	Oh!\nFriend is Agate?
3	You know my name?
4	Me hear from Digidigi.\nHe say you search for new mineral\nor some such.
5	Exactly!\nIt's always been my dream to discover\na brand-new type of mineral.
6	Normally, Misimisi have policy of\nrefuse appraisal for walk-ins, but...
7	Digidigi vouch for you, so me make\nexception. Please no hesitate to\nbring minerals if you find any!
8	Me appraise for free, and even\npay little something for it if friends\nbring something good.
9	Wahey! How generous!
10	Why so surprised?\nStingy Nopon is rarity these days.
11	Master Tora, I think you meant\nthe opposite of what you said...
12	Misimisi not speak to you!\nFriend Agate is exception, me said!
13	Thank you again!
14	I hope you like appraising stones,\nbecause I know I'll be bringing you lots!
15	But first I'll have to find them,\nthe rare minerals from deposits\nall over the world...
qst202804_ms.json
1	[ML:undisp ]Gah...
2	This place is chockers with Parisax...
3	...Parisax?
4	Not Agate's idea of fun, I can tell...
5	What do we do?\nShould we pull back?
6	No, no... I'll be fine!
7	If that's all there is of them,\nI can probably handle it, honestly...
8	And anyway, the mineral I'm after\nshould be back there...
9	I've come this far and I don't plan on\nstopping now.
10	So... Here I go!
11	I'll just have to not go too close...
12	Let's maybe move slowly to avoid\nriling them up...?
13	[ML:undisp ]Huh-?!
14	[ML:undisp ]Ee!!! *faints*
15	Agate, are you OK?!
16	Huh.\nShe's out cold.
17	We should probably not stall here...
18	Let's turn back!
19	...Uhh?\nDid I...faint?
20	...Man. Sorry...
21	Don't even mention it.
22	Everyone's got a weakness, yeah?
23	Yeah, but...\nIt's so silly...
24	You guys came here because of my whims,\nand I just went and passed out...
25	So, what we do now?
26	[ML:undisp ]Hm...
27	[ML:undisp ]...
28	How about we wipe out the Parisax,\nand call you when the coast is clear?
29	That won't do... I know I need to\nget over this and deal with things myself.
30	Tora thought Agate terrified of bugs?
31	Well... Yeah, but...
32	OK, here's what you do. First, we cover up\nyour eyes...
33	Uh, then I might hit one of you by mistake...
34	Look Agate, you're always helping out\nyour allies, right?
35	Isn't it only right to let your allies help you out\nwhen the need arises?
36	You're not wrong there, but still...
37	Stop being so difficult...
38	I gotta admire your stubbornness though.
39	Sounds like you'll just have to go and do it then.
40	I will, won't I...
41	Talking to you all, I finally understood.
42	I want to move forward from here and obtain\nthis new mineral, all on my own strength.
43	So just because some bugs showed up, I got\nall woozy? Nah, I'm not giving up that easy.
44	If slaying some icky icky bugs is what it takes,\nthen I will screw up my courage and slay!
45	Uh, mind you don't blow your top there...
46	Ah, there, that's the Agate we know.
47	Yep!
48	OK everyone, are we ready to give it another shot?
49	Always!
50	I'll try to keep up as best as I can, I guess.\nNo holding back, yeah?
51	Thank you!\nOK, let the carapace-kicking commence!
qst202805_ms.json
1	Whoa!\nThis stone...
2	What a lovely striated pattern.
3	It's amazing!\nI've never seen anything like it.
4	Maybe it's a whole new kind?
5	Misimisi will know. Let's go and\nget this appraised!
6	Yeah!\nI can't wait!
qst202806_ms.json
1	Meh-me-meh...
2	Meh-eh, me-me-me-mehh...
3	...Well?
4	[ML:undisp]......
5	Job is good one!\nThis unlike any mineral me ever saw.
6	For sure?\nFor really sure?!
7	For really sure, meh!\nIt definitely never-before-seen mineral!
8	Nice one, Agate.
9	Good to know all that courage wasn't wasted.
10	Aww, thanks you guys!
11	...All right, to victor go spoils.\nDiscoverer of mineral have naming rights!
12	What friend want to call it?
13	Ahh, um...
14	Go on, then.
15	I bet you've got one ready.
16	OK. Then how about...\nRepymynidro-pomòbrizepan?
17	Repymy...what?
18	I just took the first syllables of all your names...
19	I've forgotten already!
20	And is friend not forgetting someone...?
21	Just call it agate, you doofus.
22	Seconded.
23	Just my name? That's so presumptuous!\nI couldn't have done it without you all...
24	Don't be silly!
25	Right, right. Give mineral name of discoverer\nis very common thing.
26	Become proof that friend make this great discovery.
27	Blades lose their memories eventually...
28	If that happens to you, Agate,
29	at least you'll know the people of Alrest\nwill always remember your name.
30	That's not so bad, is it?
31	Hm...
32	So...I can actually call it "agate"?
33	Yeah, I think it sounds great.
34	A pretty name for a pretty chunk of rock.
35	Then from this day on, this mineral\nknown as agate!
36	Thank you so much!
qst202807_ms.json
1	I found something!
2	...Hmm, I don't think I've seen one\nlike that before.
3	Agreed, I think it's something rare.\nLet's get Misimisi to appraise it!
qst202808_ms.json
1	B-b-b-BUGS?!
2	Agate, calm down!

4	That'd be me, hon.\nWhat's troubling you?

7	Oh, that little girl who took\na shine to her...
8	You answered a bunch of questions\nfor her, right, Dahlia?
9	Well, she just kept asking!
10	Now let me think...
11	It's just an idea, but she might've gone\nlooking for Moondrops.
12	I told her they only bloom at night, see.
13	Y-you mean she might be wandering\noutside of Theosoir right now?!
14	Well, I can't say for sure...
15	But I guess this is probably my fault.
16	You wait right here, an' I'll go see\nif I can't bring your daughter home\nsafe and sound.
17	Thank you so much...\nPlease do find her!
18	You might want to try asking her\nfriends if she said anything.

9	Was in such deep meditation, did not\nnotice when snow pile up on top of me.\nAlmost became Nopon Icicle!
10	But me feel like me has achieved new\nlevel of enlightenment from experience.
11	Even for a Nopon, this guy's weird...
12	Still, if he's been around here,\nhe might know something.\nWe gotta find out where Kastina went.
13	Listen, did you see a Tantalese girl\naround here? We heard she was\ncomin' over this way.

17	I never saw something so pretty.
18	Even Moondrops aren't as beautiful\nas what I'm lookin' at right now.
19	More pretty than Moondrops?
20	Uh-huh. I'm talking about your\nsweet little heart, hon.

qst202915_ms.json
1	You sure you want to just stand\nthere smilin'?
2	This girl's a proper go-getter.\nIf you're not careful, she might steal\nme away from you someday!
3	Well, I wouldn't want that...\nBut I think it'll be fine.
4	Like you said, your Driver's tough\nenough to take a challenge!
5	Well, that doesn't sound great...\nBut don't you worry!
6	You said it yourself - I'm tough\nenough to take any challenge!
7	That would be quite problematic,\nbut I see no reason to worry.
8	After all, it is as you say. Your Driver\nis tough enough to take any challenge!
9	That would be a pain, but don't\nyou worry yourself!
10	Like you said, your Driver's tough!\nI can handle the challenge!
11	Hahah... I did say that, didn't I?\nI guess I can rest easy, then!

1	Hey. Good timing.\nThere's something I wanted\nto talk with you guys about.
2	Our little mercenary band's been\ngetting more and more jobs lately.\nI'm thinking we need to expand.
3	But to do that, we'll need more\nresources than we have right now.
4	A lot of jobs require traveling, and\nthat means taking rations, medicine,\nmaintenance and camping tools...
5	More supplies than I can list, to be\nfrank. I'd like to enlist your help\ncollecting some of them.
6	With more supplies, we'll be able to\nsend more members on missions\ninstead of leaving them sitting idle.
7	For more details, talk to Zuo.\nHe's our supplies specialist.\nYou'll find him outside the warehouse.
8	For info on what we need to collect,\nask Zuo. He's outside the warehouse.
9	Nice going!
10	I heard you were a real hero out there!
11	Must've been tough fighting that many\nat once. You really saved our bacon!
12	It can't have been easy, collecting\nall those food supplies. Everyone\nwas thrilled to see it!
13	Having to run this mercenary band\nby ourselves has taught me a lot.
14	Not least just how much Vandham\nreally did for us when he was around.
15	We've still got a long way to go\nbefore we can live up to him...
16	Ah, sorry. Didn't mean to turn this\ninto some kind of sob story.
17	At any rate, thanks to your help,\nwe'll be able to expand our activities.
18	Let's all keep doing what we can\nto carry on what Vandham started!
19	If there's anything else we need,\nI'll let you know. We're counting\non you guys!
qst300102_ms.json
1	Ah, there you are.\nI'll fill you in on the details.
2	What we really need to expand our\nactivities is to stock up on food\nsupplies for long-range missions!
3	It's not always possible to find\nrations at the destination, so we\nhave to take our own, just in case.
4	When he was around, Vandham used\nto take care of sourcing and managing\nthe rations all by himself.
5	Without him, we're still figuring\nout how to take care of it all.
6	And it's not easy to find\na good solution.
7	While we figure it out, the stocks\nwe have are depleting fast.
8	So we have to source some more\nbefore they actually run out.
9	So yeah, I'd like you to take care of\ncollecting ingredients and preparing\nsome food rations.
10	What do you think?\nCan you handle it?
11	Nice! I'll pass on the word to let\nyou use the cooking equipment\nat the Plaza of Reprieve.
12	Once you've got the ingredients, you\ncan head there and make the rations.
13	It doesn't matter too much what\ningredients you use, just as long\nas they'll keep.
14	We're all counting on you!
15	Once you've got enough ingredients,\nhead to the cooking equipment at the\nPlaza of Reprieve to make the rations.
16	Did you stop by Sadecott Groceries?
17	It's just Mimaira was asking after you.\nMaybe you should go talk to her.
18	Thanks to you, we've got more than\nenough rations for the moment!
19	Yeah, we should be fine to send\nmore members on missions now.
20	Right, I need to sort things out\nin the warehouse, so you go\nreport in to Yew, would you?
qst300103_ms.json
1	So I hear you're making rations?\nIf I find anything I can help with,\nI'll ask Zuo to let you know.
2	Oh, you found the Mokmo Onion!\nGo on then, take it to the campfire\nand make the Dried Scented Salmon.
3	...That's quite the powerful scent...\nI'm sure it's a sign of how nutritious\nit is, but still...wow. Pungent.
4	Hey, I hear you're collecting\ningredients for rations, is that right?
5	Then you should try and get your\nhands on a Mokmo Onion!
6	Sorry, I guess that was a bit sudden.\nIt's supposed to be a really nutritious\ningredient, so it's perfect for rations.
7	They grow on Lascham Island in\nGormott, but they're buried really deep,\nso you don't see them in shops much.
8	It shouldn't be too hard to find the\nplace where they grow, but actually\nobtaining them might be a challenge.
9	Still, a Mokmo Onion or two would\nmake for perfect Dried Scented\nSalmon, so it's definitely worth a try!
10	I'll give you the Breath Charcoal\nand Steel Salmon and you can get\nthe Mokmo Onion. Don't give up!
11	Don't give up the search, will you?
qst300104_ms.json
1	Everyone's really thrilled about all\nthe rations we have now thanks to you!
2	Just a little more, and we should\nbe sorted for...hmm?
3	Is it me, or does something\nsmell around here?
4	Hey! Take a look at that!
qst300105_ms.json
1	Whew, looks like that's the last of 'em.
2	Thanks for that, you really\nare lifesavers!
3	I guess we'll have to store these\nrations carefully to make sure the\nsmell doesn't get out...
4	At any rate, you're starting to\nshape up into a proper leader!
5	I reckon you'll be able to handle\nmanaging more mercenary missions.
6	Keep up the good work, for old\nVandham's sake if nothing else!

3	We could whack the whole bunch, but\nif we just defeat the leader of the flock,\nthey ought to disperse...
4	But Vandham always used to take\nthem out so casually, I don't know\nhow to tell which one the leader is!

3	I don't know what it was exactly...
4	Or rather, she wouldn't tell me.\nJust laughed and said "You'd never be\nable to get your hands on it anyway"!

4	Heya. Looks like the mercs are finding\ntheir feet again, and about time too.
5	It's all down to you too. You've put a\nhelluva effort in. But, the thing is...
6	Some of the vets still aren't all that\nkeen on accepting an outsider as\nour boss.
7	But it's to be expected. Trust isn't\nsomething you win overnight.
8	So I asked around a bit, tried to\nget folks' opinions on the issue.
9	Basically, best thing for it would be\nto have a couple of sparring matches\nwith some of the old hands.
10	Easiest way to win our\nrespect as leader is through\na show of strength.
11	You get what I'm saying, yeah?\nGood on you!
12	Could head over to the training ground?\nCheers!
13	We've already got a line-up ready\nfor you.
14	No need to go easy on 'em. They're\nused to getting a few bruises!
15	We're having the sparring matches\nover at the training ground. If you\ncould head there now, that'd be ace.

8	You aren't happy with me?
9	Yew and Zuo told us you're strong.
10	What we'd have given to fight by\nVandham's side...
11	In the mercs, you've gotta prove\nyourself or it doesn't mean squat!
12	Nah, it's nothing personal.\nVandham respected you and\nI won't contest that.
13	But what made us believe in Vandham\nwas seeing him in action. Seeing him\nat the top of his game.
14	I want you to do the same. Gimme\neverything you've got. Prove to me\nyou are what they say you are!
15	Let's get this show on the road!
16	I surrender! Hats off to you.\nThat was a fine show of skill.
17	But boy am I stoked after that. How\nabout another round? Just kidding!
18	Even after we dragged you into\nthis brawl, you're still showing us\ncompassion?
19	Almost feels like I'm speaking with\nVandham himself!
20	He had a heart as wide as the\nCloud Sea. You two were really\nalike, y'know.
21	All right, I give up!\nSorry we had to do all this!
22	Well, you've talked us round. But that\nbloke over there's not convinced yet.

5	For your last fight, you're gonna\nbe facing me and Zuo!
6	Beating us is sure to put this whole\nthing to rest once and for all.
7	Besides, watching you fight's really\ngot my adrenaline pumping!
8	C'mon! Lemme show you we ain't\nthe pushovers we used to be!
9	And give it everything you've got!
10	You win, fair and square. No wonder\nVandham had his eye on you.
11	You were worried about hurting us,\nweren't you? I could tell.
12	You tried to wear us down without\ntrying to really hurt us. That takes\ngreat effort, that.
13	I felt the same way whenever I went\nup against Vandham.
14	Heh! Looks like we'll have to up our\ngame next time!
15	Well, I think everyone's gonna know\nwho's boss from now on.
16	The mercs'll relax a bit now they've got\na real heavy hitter in charge.
17	If we can keep this up, I reckon\nwe'll be as good as we were when \nthe Big Man was still around.
18	Let's all keep accepting missions\nand aim to be the best we can be!

12	All right. Just don't take too long.
13	I'd like to have Rex handle the\ninterviews, if possible.\nCould you bring him, perhaps?
14	All right, you've heard their appeals.\nWho do you think's best for the job?
15	First, there's Alicia. She's sure to bring\nsomething new and fresh to the mercs.
16	Then there's Popoh, the Nopon. She\nstruck me as cool and level-headed.
17	And lastly, Zengrid, the former noble.\nHe seems perfectly respectable.

19	Alicia
20	Popoh

23	Having a capable woman on board's\nsure to raise the crew's morale.
24	We all get a bit tetchy after a long\nday of battle. She's sure to calm the\ncrew down.
25	He's a bit of an oddball, but I'd be\nmore than welcome to let him handle\nour financial matters.
26	Yep, I think we're onto a winner here!
27	Y'know, sometimes you get a look in\nyour eye that reminds me of Vandham.\nYou're really taking to being in charge.
28	If only the Big Man could see you now.
29	Here's to the Garfont Mercs and\nto the bright future ahead of us!

22	Well, I've been putting out feelers\nhere and there, and I have to say...
23	Not a bad word was ever said\nabout the Garfont Mercs. They've\nan excellent reputation.
24	I don't have combat experience\nmyself, but I believe that I'm more than\ncapable of helping from the sidelines.
25	You must have other reasons, no?
26	Well...to be frank with you, there was\nnothing truly engaging for me back in\nAlba Cavanich.
27	Everyone there is so sour-faced and\nmiserable and always in a hurry...\nThat's why I left Mor Ardain.
28	Oh, nothing that stands out in any\nspecial capacity...
29	But if I had to pick, I'd say it's my\nforward-thinking attitude.
30	That's a really good attitude to have!
31	You think so? I'm glad.
32	Ah, I'm also an excellent cook!\nGive me any drink and I'll rustle\nup the perfect meal to match it!
33	I haven't really thought that far ahead...
34	I believe that if I'm happy in the here\nand now, then the future is sure to be\njust as bright.
35	Does that apply only to yourself?
36	No, no, not at all. That would be\nvery lonely, wouldn't it? If I were\nthe only one who were happy...
37	I always do my very best to make the\npeople around me smile. Of that you\ncan be sure.
38	All right, I think we can wrap\nit up there.
39	We'll make our final decision shortly.\nYou can go.

13	What should I ask about?
14	Her personal motivations
15	Her strongest skills
16	Where she sees herself in five years
17	Nothing in particular
18	At first, me want job in Merc Group,\nbut that all about fighting. Not fit with\ncore skills of Popoh.
19	Then later, me hear about admin\nposition, so me leap at chance!
20	Uh-huh. And why is it you want to\njoin the Merc Group?
21	Well, Popoh big, big fan of big people!
22	And Merc Group full to brim with big\npeople! Popoh think would feel nice\nif pet-pet on head with big hands!
23	Meh? Let Popoh think...
24	Strongest skill of Popoh probably\nglossy sheen of fur! It super fluffy\nand soft to touch!
25	It won't bother you even if lots of\npeople pet you?
26	Popoh happy when people pet-pet!\nMake sure to tell that to mercs!
27	If at end of long day, mercs need\nto pet-pet Popoh, could be nothing\nhappier!
28	Me not have any grandiose dream...
29	But if able to cheer up sad people or\nlonely through pet-pets, then that\nenough for Popoh.
30	It must be hard work maintaining\nyour coat, no?
31	Oh, tell Popoh about it!\nMe have rigorous fur-care regime.\nNever miss day!
32	That actually big benefit to Garfont.\nMuch clean water for rinsing fur!
33	Good, I think we'll stop here.

14	I come from a long line of nobility\noriginating in Fonsa Myma, but they\nhave since fallen from grace.
15	I know what it is to make ends meet\nand am therefore well suited to any\nposition that involves accounting.

24	Any particular reason why?
25	As you know, my once-noble house\nis but a shadow of itself now.
26	If I am to return it to its former\neminence, I'm going to need capital.
27	To that end, I will have you hire me!\n...I mean, I hope that you will.
28	I have no home, no fortunes to fall back\non. All I have now is an excessively long\nname and a shrewd business sense.
29	Could you go into more detail there?
30	I had a good upbringing, back when\nI was part of the nobility.
31	And in that time, I learned to discern\ntrue quality from cheap knock-offs.
32	So I can say with confidence that\nI shall be able to find you the best\ndeals on high grade equipment.
33	I'm looking to return to my former\nglory. I can't be stuck forever with\na servant boy's wages.
34	And what would you be bringing\nto the Merc Group?
35	I can streamline your resource\nmanagement so that you will be able\nto operate as efficiently as possible.
36	In the short while I've been here, I can\nalready see weapons, food, materials\njust lying around, being put to waste.
37	Your numbers have shot up recently,\nwhich means that you're too busy to\nhandle every little thing. Am I wrong?
38	All right, we'll finish up there.
39	We'll announce our decision in a\nshort while. You can leave now.
40	If you don't hire me, you'll sorely reg-\n...Please excuse me. I can't seem to\nkick the old aristocratic hauteur...

4	I have been expecting you.
5	I daresay there is no need for\nintroductions here, but as a matter\nof formality...
6	My name is Raqura, Queen Regnant\nof the Kingdom of Uraya.\n...Perhaps you are surprised to see me.
7	As the ruler of a nation, it is not\nprudent to make my movements widely\nknown, you understand. My apologies.
8	Thank you.\nI have heard much of your exploits\nwith the Garfont Mercenaries.
9	I asked for you because of your\nproven skills and your unique position\nwhich allows you to move freely.
10	In Uraya, there are six great noble\nlines said to descend directly from\nthe nation's founders.
11	My own family, the House of Selosia,\nis counted among these six.
12	Each of the six lines has a treasure\ncalled a Jeweled Signet, a precious\nring passed down for generations.
13	When the six Jeweled Signets are\nbrought together, they form a single\nseal - the national symbol of Uraya.
14	But recently we received word that\none of the six Jeweled Signets has\nbeen stolen, its whereabouts unknown.
15	What we do know is the name of\nthe man who stole it - a Gormotti\nmercenary known as Gavyth.
16	I would like you to recover the\nJeweled Signet from this man.
17	You would be willing to do this?\nI am most grateful.
18	In the present political climate, it would\nbe unwise to make this incident public\nby mounting an official investigation.
19	Who knows what unrest might ensue\nif the people knew a symbol of our\nvery sovereignty had gone missing?
20	I wish you the best of luck\nin this endeavor.
21	Thank you all. Your work was as\nimpeccable as your reputation suggests.
22	I conducted some investigations\nof my own behind the scenes.
23	It seems this was all a plot by an\nelite figure within Mor Ardain to take\nadvantage of the succession conflict.
24	Worry not.
25	Your mercenary comrades were able\nto apprehend the main culprit as\nhe escaped from the Empire.
26	And with the Jeweled Signet\nrecovered, it seems this entire\nincident has been neatly resolved.
27	I will send your compensation\nthrough the Garfont Mercenaries,\nas is the custom.
28	I truly am grateful for your efforts.\nWithout your help, who knows\nwhat may have happened.
29	I look forward to hearing of your\nfurther exploits in the future!

2	Could you hand over the\nJeweled Signet you stole?
3	We'll be taking that Jeweled Signet\nyou stole, thanks!
4	Let's have that Jeweled Signet\nyou stole now, shall we?!
5	Give back stolen jewel ring!
6	It's time you returned the\nJeweled Signet you stole.
7	I don't think so.
8	I need this ring to secure a\nprosperous future for Gormott.
9	If you're going to stand in my way,\nI won't hold back!

2	Ughhh...\nYou don't even understand that\nyou're in the wrong here, do you?
3	Restoring the glory of Envia is the\nonly way to create a brighter future\nfor the people of Gormott!
4	The glory...of Envia?
5	That's right! The noble House of Envia,\na proud line unjustly cut short!
6	Those who bear the blood of Hannes,\nLord of Envia, are the rightful heirs\nto the throne of Uraya!
7	Envia... Hannes...\nYou speak of the War of Succession.
8	The War of Succession?\nI feel like I've heard of that...
9	It was a struggle between the noble\nhouses of Uraya, which occurred\naround the nation's inception.
10	Though only six noble houses currently\nhold political power in Uraya...
11	There were once a full nine noble lines\nvying for the throne.
12	The House of Envia was foremost\namong them, and a powerful rival\nto the House of Selosia.
13	But Hannes, the leader of the House\nof Envia, was not blessed with an heir\nwho could carry on his legacy.
14	There were claims that he had a secret\nchild somewhere in Gormott, but they\nultimately amounted to nothing.
15	Thus the House of Selosia claimed\nthe throne, and the present Kingdom\nof Uraya took shape.
16	You know your stuff, I'll give you that...\nBut the heir of Hannes did exist!
17	And his bloodline lives on in\nGormott to this day!
18	I see... So you wish to entrust the\nJeweled Signet to this supposed heir\nand begin the War of Succession anew.
19	What?! We can't let that happen!
20	Regardless of your motivations,\nI'm afraid we will be taking that Signet.
21	I don't have it here.\nAnd I'm not telling you where it is.
22	What?!
23	If Mor Ardain learns of this potential\nconflict, Uraya will fall into disarray.
24	The effects of this unrest will doubtless\nextend to Gormott, and to this city,\nwith its Ardainian military installation.
25	That's not true! He promised there\nwouldn't be any adverse-
26	...Go on.
27	I...it's a guy from the Titan battleship.\nThe one stationed at the Torigoth Base.
28	I don't know his name...
29	He said if we brought him the Signet,\nthe heir of Hannes would become King\nand unite Uraya and Gormott as one!
30	A fanciful notion. Even if they have\ntruly uncovered an heir, I doubt they\ncould so much as prove his legitimacy.
31	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Urgh...!\nDamn it all!
32	We must take that Signet back\nbefore it reaches the Empire.
33	Yeah... Let's go!

3	A Jeweled Signet?\nNothing of that sort around here,\nI assure you.
4	Now, if you will excuse me, we are\nquite busy here with preparations to\ndepart. I would ask you to kindly leave.

4	(What shall we ask about?)
5	About the heir of Hannes
6	About this incident's mastermind
7	I know nothing of an heir.
8	Our lord merely suggested that we use\nthe rumors from the Succession War\nto make our claim sound legitimate.
9	There's no point asking after our lord.\nHe will already have escaped to a safe\nlocation by now. You'll never find him!
10	We have already informed our lord\nthat you people were snooping around.
11	I'm sure he will already have escaped\nto somewhere you will never find him!
12	He was the one who came up with\nthe idea to take advantage of the wild\nrumors of an Envian heir, you know.
13	This is the key to the room where\nthe Jeweled Signet is hidden.\nDo with it as you wish.
14	I am the captain of this vessel.
15	I value the safety of my ship and its\ncrew over securing an item for a client\nwho will already have gone into hiding...
16	If we resist you any further, I doubt\nthis ship would stay unharmed for long.

2	Glad you could make it.
3	I just wanted to take a moment to\nreport in to old Vandham together\nwith you guys.
4	Boss...
5	We never properly appreciated\nhow much you did for us until you\nweren't around any more.
6	Organizing all our missions, managing\nthe rations, balancing the manpower...\nThere's no end to it, really.
7	At first, we weren't sure how to go on\nwithout you. But by working together,\nI think we've managed to pull through!
8	Vandham...
9	I'm afraid I still don't remember the\ndays I spent fighting by your side.
10	But watching Rex, his friends, and the\npeople of this village, it's easy to see\nhow great a man you must've been.
11	I don't know if I can really carry on\nyour legacy, but I swear I'll keep these\npeople safe. You can count on that.
12	Old man, the mercenary band you\nstarted isn't going away any time soon.\nWe'll keep it going just as strong...
13	No, we'll build it up until it's ten times\nstronger than the day you left it!
14	So don't you worry about us.\nRest your old bones in peace,\nyou hear?
15	This kid Rex you brought us is one\nheckuva leader. So we're good.
16	Right, I think that should be enough\nto satisfy the old man!
17	Thanks for joining us for this.\nIt meant a lot to me.
18	And keep up the good work, boss!

2	Hey, Shynini. You still got that\nthing we talked about before?
3	Ahh! Rex finally save up\nmoney to purchase?
4	You got it!\nCan I have a look?
5	Why Rex suddenly have much moneys?\nSalvaged some amazing treasure?
6	I've taken on a big job direct from\nthe Chairman. I got 100,000G\njust from the advance payment!
7	Wow. That quite impressive.
8	But I'll be going into uncharted waters,\nso I want to make sure I'm prepared.

10	Good luck on job!
qst400102_ms.json
1	Right, now that's sorted...
2	And I've still got a fair amount of cash\nleft. Time to send some back home to\nthe folks at Fonsett.
3	I'd best go see Melolo at the\nCentral Exchange again.
qst400103_ms.json
1	Hey, Max!\nI'd like to transfer some money.
2	Why, if it isn't Rex. Pretty rare for a\nclient to drop cash off in person.
3	It's a big sum this time, so Melolo\nsaid I should bring it straight to you.
4	You're quite the guy, you know.\nNot many people send all this money\nback to their folks every single month.
5	Haha... It's not that big a deal.
6	So, how much are we talking?
7	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]I don't want to completely empty\nmy pockets... So after leaving a bit\nfor myself, let's say...
8	[ML:Feeling ]Can you deliver 90,000G to\nCorinne of Fonsett Village, please?
9	Whew, that's quite the healthy sum.\nDid you haul up some huge treasure?
10	Something like that.\nI took on a big job from the Chairman.
11	Now that sure sounds like a pie\nI'd like a piece of.
12	Oh yeah, I got a delivery for you too.\nGood thing you dropped by, else I'd've\nhad to track you down!
13	It's from that same Auntie Corinne\nof yours, actually.
14	Ohhh, it's Braised Cloud Sea Shark!
15	Mmmm, it looks delicious...\nI'll have to dig in to that later.
16	Thanks, Max.\nTake care of that transfer for me, OK?

1	Hello there, friend Rex!\nRurui, proprietor of Whiteside\nSalvaging, at your service!
2	No need for introductions with me,\nRurui. I was thinking of going to check\nout some cylinders in a bit.
3	Well, that perfect timing! Rurui just\nget in brand-new cylinder type.\nIf having time, friend want to test out?
4	Really? You'd let me?
5	Rex is up-and-coming star of salvager\nworld. If Rex approve of quality, easier\nfor Rurui to sell!
6	It's not every day you get the chance\nto test out a brand-new product.\nI'd be glad to help!
7	Then it settled!\nCome see Rurui on rear deck shortly\nthen. Rurui will make preparation!
8	Gotcha!
qst400105_ms.json
1	This is brand-new cylinder.\nPlease test out at nearby Salvage Point\nand tell Rurui impressions from using.
2	All right, then.\nLeave it to me!
3	Salvage point at end of this pier is\nperfect place for test new cylinder.
4	Look like friend all finished.\nHow was new cylinder?
5	Let's be honest here.
6	It was fantastic!
7	It was all right.
8	It wasn't great.
9	Fantastic? That good to hear!\nRurui hope other salvagers feel\nsame way!
10	"All right"?! That such vague answer!
11	But it true that not easy to get used\nto new cylinder after only one use.
12	Rex sure problem with cylinder and not\njust bad luck? This good value cylinder,\nshould always fetch decent treasure!
13	At any rate, thanks much for help.
14	If friend ever run out of cylinders,\nplease drop by shop any time.\nWe make deal!
15	Also, here, give friend present of three\nnormal cylinder. Can use in same place\nas before, meh! Happy salvaging!

1	I guess I got a bit distracted...\nWhat was I meant to be doing again?
2	Hmm... I guess I should\nstock up on food supplies.

4	Yeah, I'll visit Fishy Fishy on the\nthird floor. Then I should be all set!

1	Welcome friend!
2	Now then, what should I buy?
3	Thanks for custom!
4	I should probably think carefully\nabout what I need.
5	Though I guess... As long as it fills\nmy stomach, it doesn't make all\nthat much difference?
qst400108_ms.json
1	Rex back again?\nDid friend forget something?
2	No, I didn't exactly forget anything.\nI just decided to make a cash transfer.
3	Rex find money on floor? Nopon round\nhere very particular about money, so\nshould turn in even small change!
4	No, I didn't pick up any small change...\nActually, I got my hands on a big sum.
5	Big sum? Like 2,000G?
6	I'd rather not bandy the number\nabout too much, but...
7	More like a hundred thousand.
8	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]HUNDRED THOUSAND?!!!!!!
9	[ML:Feeling ]Not so loud...!
10	Oh. Yes. Sorry much!
11	But where Rex get all that gold...?
12	Actually no. No need to tell Melolo!\nMelolo not want get mixed up in\nshady business!
13	I don't think it's that big of a deal...
14	Anyhoodles, Rex. Melolo not able to\naccept such large sum here anyway.\nShould take directly to courier.
15	All monies Melolo accept here\nalways delivered through courier\ncalled Max.
16	Oh, OK! Max, I know him.
17	I didn't know he was also delivering\nthe money for me all this time... Huh!
18	Well, this certainly make things quicker!\nFriend know where to find Max?
19	Yeah, he'll be just through the\nArgentum Bazaar, right?\nThanks, Melolo!
20	Friend not know where to find\ncourier Max after all?
21	Instead of go up main staircase to\nChairman's Room, go down small\nsteps to right instead.
22	Then friend see Whiteside Salvaging\nshop. Max right next to that.

1	Turuni know this of course.
2	But Turuni is informant by trade.\nCan not provide information without\nproper compensation.
3	Thanks much for custom!
4	Inside Titan battleship, Gormotti girl\nbeing held prisoner.
5	Unfortunately Turuni not yet receive\nintelligence specifying prisoner name.
6	But rumor say, big ship arrive for sole\npurpose of holding one measly girl.
7	People of Gormott getting along quite\nwell with Empire nowadays, so trouble\nlike this not very welcome!
8	That seem to be opinion of\nmost of Torigoth resident.
9	That about extent of information\nTuruni know.
10	Enough to satisfy friends?
11	Turuni offer super-special bargain\nprice and friends still not purchase?
12	If friends short on cash, maybe should\ngo outside town and defeat monster.
13	Normally, Turuni charge for this\nkind of information too, but this time\nprovide specially for free.
14	Hoping to see friends again!
qst400202_ms.json
1	Oh yeah, I heard about that.
2	Some Ardainian dude was saying\nthey were going to "execute the\nprisoner" within the next few days!
3	Those Torna guys are pretty bad, right?
4	I heard they've killed loads of Drivers\nto steal their Core Crystals.
5	Pretty amazing if the Empire have\nreally captured one of them!
6	The Empire's so cool!
7	I wonder what they'll do at this\n"execution" thing, anyway.\nI've never seen one before!
8	I've gotta go see for myself!\nYou guys should come along too!
qst400203_ms.json
1	Oh yeah, I heard something interesting.
2	Apparently the Torna member that the\nArdainian Empire captured was some\nGormotti girl called Nia.
3	Nia...
4	That name seems familiar somehow.\nDidn't the old lord of Echell a decade\nor so ago have...
5	Actually, let's not talk about that.\nIt's not a happy thing to think about.
qst400204_ms.json
1	I dunno anything about that.
2	But the grown-ups do seem to be\ntalking about secret complicated\nstuff a lot lately...
3	Apparently there are some kind of\ndangerous people causing trouble...
4	It's only been ten years since the war\nbetween Mor Ardain and Uraya ended.\nWhy would they stir up more trouble?
5	It sounds like a real pain...\nI hope the Ardainian soldiers\nwill be able to protect us.
qst400205_ms.json
1	Who are you people?
2	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Uh-oh. Maybe it wasn't a good idea\nto ask an Ardainian soldier...
3	[ML:Feeling ]Um, there was something I wanted\nto ask, but now I've clean forgotten\nwhat it was!
4	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Actually, asking an Ardainian soldier\nmay not have been the best plan...
5	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]There was something I wanted to ask,\nbut actually, I'm sure you're busy!
6	Hmph... If it's information you're after,\ngo pay for it at a local informant.
7	Chatting with the populace isn't\nour job, you understand.
qst400206_ms.json
1	Ahh, sorry...\nI'm only really interested in plants.\nI don't keep up with the latest rumors...
2	I want to become a botanist in\nMor Ardain, but my parents keep\nsaying it's too dangerous...
3	It's been a whole decade now\nsince Mor Ardain and Uraya\nceased hostilities...
4	And sure, there's been this nasty\ngroup called Torna popping up in\nthe news lately, but still...
5	It's not like anything bad's gonna\nhappen where Mor Ardain's in charge.\nDoesn't this peaceful town prove that?
qst400207_ms.json
1	Forget about that, did you know this?!
2	Apparently whenever a new Blade\nis born, it has to be registered with\nthe Praetorium of Indol!
3	W...wow, that's really interesting...
4	Th...that's very interesting!\nYou certainly know a lot.
5	Yeah, so I bet that guy who just got\nscouted to be a Driver will have to\ngo there sooner or later.
6	When I grow up, I wanna become\na Driver and visit Indol too!
qst400208_ms.json
1	Mmmm... Can't say I have.
2	If it's information you're after,\nwhy don't you go visit the informant\nover near Llysiau Greens?
3	He's one crafty little Nopon.\nThere's not much he doesn't know.
qst400302_ms.json
1	Well, hello there!
2	Tora here to buy Perfect Range Sensor\nand Bion Connectors!
3	Ahhh, you're the young Nopon who was\ngazing longingly at those the other day.
4	Meh-meh?! You noticed?!
5	Well, considering you were staring\nfor three hours straight...
6	But I'm dreadfully sorry... We're all out\nof Perfect Range Sensors right now.
7	We've got plenty of Bion Connectors\nstill, though. They're 4,000G apiece.
8	Twelve thousand for three of them,\nhuh... That really is pretty pricey.
9	Rex-Rex promised to pay\nwhole amount. No backsies!
10	I mean, sure, I'm not about to go\nback on my word, but... Hmm...
11	Are you one of those salvagers?
12	Yep. I may not look it, but I'm\nactually a professional at it.
13	Then maybe you could get a\nBion Connector that way.
14	Apparently they fish the things up\nquite regularly around this season.
15	Now that's not a bad idea.
16	Let's go give it a try!
17	Good luck, Rex-Rex!
18	I'll, um, cheer you on too!
qst400303_ms.json
1	The real problem is the\nPerfect Range Sensor.
2	Could we not salvage that, as well?
3	Don't think I've heard of any\nlikely spots for those lately...
4	They're almost impossible to find\nexcept when the Titans and the Cloud\nSea align in exactly the right way.
5	And even if we did find a spot where\nthey might show up, we'd need a\nlot of luck to actually bag one.
6	We don't exactly have time to waste,\nso perhaps salvaging isn't the answer...
7	Hey, can I ask you something?
8	From the looks of it, this young lady\nhere's a Blade and you're her Driver,\nam I right?
9	Huh?
10	Urk...\nI-is that what it looks like?
11	Wait one moment please!\nRex-Rex and Tora also Blade actually!
12	Does that make me the Driver?
13	Surely the Driver would have to be me.
14	Can we try to be a LITTLE believable\nhere?! We need to sort out our stories...
15	Hey now, no need to get your\nknickers in a twist.
16	I'm just a regular botanist.
17	Botanist?! Tora would never guessed!
18	I get that a lot.
19	Thing is, I was heading to Lascham\nIsland for a spot of fieldwork, but I ran\ninto a bit of...monster trouble.
20	I tried asking the Imperial Army\nto help me out, but it looks like\nthey're pretty busy right now.
21	So I figure if you lot are decent at\nfighting, maybe you could take care\nof the issue for me.
22	If you help me out, I might just be\nable to spare a Perfect Range Sensor\nI've got lying around in storage.
23	Well, that sounds perfect!
24	Yeah. We'll see what we can do!
25	Lascham Island isn't hard to find.\nYou can see it to the left as you exit\nthe city through the main entrance.
26	Just take care of the Juppen Krabble\nyou find there. And be careful, they can\nbe vicious!
qst400304_ms.json
1	I need you to defeat the Juppen\nKrabble lurking on Lascham Island.
2	You can see Lascham Island on the left\nas you head out of the town entrance.
3	You can take the long route around the\nplains, or if you're feeling adventurous,\nthere's a shortcut across the branches.
4	Oh hey, you're back!
5	Took out that Juppen Krabble,\ndid you? I knew I made the right call\nasking you guys.
6	Here's the Perfect Range Sensor,\nas promised.
7	We've had it lying around since my\ngrandpa's generation, so it's a bit\ndusty, but it should work just fine.
8	Thanks for all your help.
qst400305_ms.json
1	That must be the monster Cedwyn\nwas talking about.
2	Doesn't look like a pushover,\nthat's for sure.
3	Tora wish could help too, but probably\nnot much good for anything other than\ndecoy or lure.
4	No need for any of that. We can handle\nthis one just fine! Right, Pyra?
5	Absolutely!
6	No need to rely on just my power,\nthough. You should make full use\nof all your Blades!
7	Indeed. We may only have one\nDriver, but twice the Blades means\ntwice the potential!
8	Good point. I'll remember that.
9	All right... Let's do this!
qst400401_ms.json
1	Umon very lucky to have Tora and\nfriends helping with boat building!
2	Most important part to collect is\nPuzzletree Wood. This is necessary\nfor making sturdy rudder.
3	Puzzletree Wood is common to find in\nGormott, so should not be too tricky.\nTry looking in area around Torigoth.
4	And one more thing.\nI also need supply of Diamond Oak.
5	This is quite rare material, but crucial\nfor making strong bow of ship. Friends\nmay have a difficult time finding it.
6	In Gormott, only place it can be found\nis location called Dawnview Grotto.
7	Also...
8	Wait, no. Should not make too many\nrequests at once, or friends will get\nconfused. First just bring me those two!
9	Meh-meh?! Friends really brought\nall materials requested?
10	This indeed is Puzzletree Wood and\nDiamond Oak... Very impressive!
11	This should be enough to make\nstrong boat frame.
12	But too soon for celebrations!\nPlease don't get angry...
13	Maybe we have all bits we need...\nbut Titan escaped.
14	Umon unfortunately forget to feed\npoor Titan. So Titan swan off with\nrumbly tummy.
15	So friends must go and find Titan.
16	Naughty Titan was heading for\nMasrah Spring in Gormott.\nSurely you find it there.
17	Once you find Titan, feed it the\nGreen Pollen Orbs I provide you.
18	That forms contract between you and\nTitan. As long as you give Pollen Orbs,\nit gladly serve as your boat.
19	Of course, if you run out of Green\nPollen Orbs like before, that as far\nas you go...
20	But this is traditional Nopon taming\nmethod. Not like rough taming methods\nused by Mor Ardain.
21	Eheh! Friends now privy to very\nsecret trick of Titan trade!
22	A-anyway, go down to Masrah Spring.
23	Naturally, Titans not show up except\nwhen Cloud Sea is high, so be aware.
24	Go to Masrah Spring and tame\na Titan for use in ship.
25	But be aware that Titans not show up\nwhen Cloud Sea level is low.
26	Friends want to know how to make\nCloud Sea level rise?
27	Well, if friends stay at inn, level\nwill usually have changed by time\nof waking up.
28	Wonderful!\nFriends come back!
29	Have fed many Green Pollen Orbs now,\nand attachment to ship frame is all\ncomplete. Can set sail any time!
30	No need for thanks.
31	Once friends are ready to set sail, come\ntalk to Umon.
32	Latest and greatest Umon vessel\nis ready and raring to go!
33	Feel free to depart any time!
34	Set sail for the World Tree?
35	Set sail
36	Not yet
37	Have a good trip, friends!\nTake care, Tora!
38	No need to rush. Take all time you\nneed with preparations. This ship\nwill always be waiting for friends.
qst400402_ms.json
1	Titan!
2	This kind of emotional reunion!
3	We just have to give it this\nGreen Pollen Orb, right?
4	Rex, you go do it.
5	Why me?
6	I mean, I don't mind, but...
7	Try not to get eaten yourself.
8	Don't say things like that!
9	Here you go...
10	Titan swim off somewhere...
11	Perhaps it has gone to see Umon?
12	I daresay so. Titans are quite\nintelligent, I'll have you know.
13	Let's go back and see Umon, then.
qst400701_ms.json
1	Ah, Rex. Good to see you.
2	Yeah, um, hi...
3	Don't look so down.
4	The boss left a message with me.\nTo give to you, if anything ever\nhappened to him.
5	A message from Vandham, for me?!\nYou don't think...he knew he'd...?
6	Maybe. But if you ask me,\nI don't think he knew.
7	It's just the kind of life us mercenaries\nlive. You never know which day might\nturn out to be your last.
8	So it's not uncommon for us to leave\nmessages like this, just in case.
9	...
10	Now listen up, because this\nis important.
11	"Rex. I leave the Garfont Mercenaries\nin your hands."
12	...?!
13	...
14	Um... Is there anything else?
15	Nope. That's your lot.
16	What?! Leaving it to me...\nThat's a joke, right?!
17	This is no joke, kid.\nIt's Vandham through and through - he\nsays what he means, no more, no less.
18	Well, I mean, I won't deny it's simple,\nbut... Why would he ask me to...?
19	The boss thought a lot of you, kid.\nAnd I think you've struck a chord\nwith the rest of us, too.
20	You're an honest, straightforward guy,\nwith plenty of nerve and resolve.\nAnd...you give us all hope.
21	I don't think...I can really take\nall the credit for any of that...
22	Maybe not.\nBut there's something about you, kid.\nEveryone feels it.
23	So tell me, Rex.\nWill you do as the boss asks?
24	Take over the Garfont Mercenaries?
25	Yes
26	No
27	...All right.\nI'll do it!
28	Strong words, well said!\nNothing less from the guy old\nVandham staked his hopes in!
29	But, um... What exactly would I\nhave to do, as the band's leader?
30	You said you don't have any other\nmessages from Vandham, right?
31	Nope. He's a man of few words.
32	But of course, you'll have me\nand Zuo to help you out.
33	We couldn't ask you to suddenly\nhandle all the operations on your own.
34	You just dole out the big general\norders for now. You can count on\nus to take care of the details.
35	And then...I guess we'll see how\nthings go from there.
36	OK. I guess I can probably handle that.
37	Right! Then let's start by explaining\nhow things work around here.
38	Our little band takes on all kinds of\nassignments from all across Alrest.
39	From escort missions and clearing out\nmonsters, down to gathering materials,\nand sometimes even smaller things.
40	But tell me something, Rex. I get the\nfeeling you've got more Blades than\nyou know what to do with. Am I wrong?
41	If you've got Blades sitting around\ndoing nothing, you can assign them to\ncarry out missions as part of the band.
42	It'll be good experience for them,\nand you'll reap the rewards to boot.
43	Tell you what, it'll be quicker to explain\nif you try it out for yourself. Go ahead,\nchoose a mission and try clearing it.
44	Rex...
45	Could you think back to\nVandham's last moments?
46	You're the only ones who were\nthere to witness it...
47	Me and Zuo have no way of\nknowing the details.
48	How d'you think he felt, at the end?\nWhat led him to sacrifice himself?
49	Did he believe he'd found something\nworth giving his life for?
50	I want you to think carefully about that.
51	...
qst400702_ms.json
1	Right, you'll have to check the Urayan\nMerc Missions first. From there,\naccept the "First Mission".
2	Ah, but if you don't have a Blade to\nspare, it'll have to wait until you\nbond with some more...
3	Looks like you've accepted it. Good.
4	Now all you need to do is wait for the\nBlades you assigned to finish their job.
5	It's only a simple practice mission,\nso I'm sure they'll be back in no time.
6	Oh, sorry, I guess there's one\nthing I forgot to explain.
7	Once a Merc Mission ends, the\nBlades you sent will report in.
8	That's when you'll find out how it went.\nAnd of course, you'll get your rewards.
9	Point is, for a Merc Mission to be\nproperly complete, you need to\ncheck in and collect the reward.
10	Go on, give it a go now.
qst400703_ms.json
1	Thanks for coming.
2	You'll want to talk to Yew first.
3	He's got quite a bit of stuff to tell you,\nso prepare for a long chat.
4	Made it through Yew's lecture, did you?
5	First you want to be accepting\na Merc Mission.
6	Looks like you've accepted the\nmission Yew set up for you.
7	Well, all you can do now is wait. That's\nwhat it means to be a leader - you trust\nin your men to get the job done.
8	Well hey, looks like the squad you\nsent out is back already.
9	You should check out their report.
10	That way, you get your reward\nand the mission's truly over.
11	How was your first mission?\nPretty easy, I'll bet.
12	Go ahead and report back in to Yew.\nHe was worrying his ass off about\nwhether you'd get the hang of things.
qst400704_ms.json
1	Looks like you completed the mission.\nGood work, Rex.
2	As you complete missions, it'll build\nour band's reputation. The higher our\nreputation, the more missions we'll get!
3	And it'll also let you manage more\nBlades at a time.
4	Sounds like a good thing all round.
5	This time you set up a mission for me,\nbut how should I find more in future?
6	Well, let's see now. We'll send a few\nmissions your way ourselves.
7	Aside from that, you can ask around\ntown, see if anyone needs help.
8	There are plenty of people out there\nwith troubles that need solving.
9	Might be a good idea for you to go\nback and see how things are in\nArgentum or Gormott, too.
10	Ah, right. I'll have to remember that.
11	Oh yeah, I have one more piece\nof advice for you.
12	Different missions have different\nrequirements, and each Blade has\nstrengths and weaknesses too.
13	If you pay attention to the makeup\nof your squad, you might be able to\nget the job done quicker.
14	Think about everyone's strengths\nand weaknesses to get missions\ndone efficiently...got it.
15	Sounds like you're getting the idea.
16	For now, just try to complete as many\nmissions as you can. Once you're used\nto that, we'll see what else you can do.
17	I'll be wanting to give you a test,\nso drop by Garfont once in a while!
18	I have to take tests, even though\nI'm the leader...?
19	Oh, and remember - whenever you\nhave Blades going spare, don't hesitate\nto assign them to a bunch of missions.
20	We aren't going to run out of missions\nany time soon. The world is full of folk\nwho need a little mercenary help.
21	Helping people in need... So this is\nwhat Vandham devoted his life to.
22	I'll have to work hard to make this\na mercenary band he'd be proud of.
23	That's the spirit, Rex. We're all\ncounting on you, so keep it up!
qst400801_ms.json
1	Yes, I saw him.
2	Just as the ship was docking, he ran\nup the stairs in a terrible hurry.
3	I thought he wasn't a familiar face\naround here, but I'm afraid I couldn't\ntell you much about him beyond that.
qst400802_ms.json
1	Oh yes, Hanahana see boy!
2	Very scruffy boy went running\nup staircase very quick-quick.
3	Hanahana seen lots of country, but all\ncountry have some child like that.
4	Mor Ardain, Uraya, even Indol.\nGap of rich and poor exist everywhere.
5	Very sad state.
6	...Oh, friends chasing after boy to\nget back stolen thing?
7	*sigh* Should always keep valuables\ncarefully secure to body when travel!
8	Yeah... I'll be more careful in future.
qst400803_ms.json
1	I did see a boy head over towards the\nfarm...was he the one you're after?
2	I feel like this city's getting less safe\nrecently... There was that nasty incident\nnot long ago too, and the water outage.
3	Torigoth has the biggest Ardainian base\nin the whole of Gormott, you know.
4	In other regions, the Ardainians don't\nhave quite as much influence.\nI just worry about the future, is all...
qst400804_ms.json
1	Nope, I di'n't see nobody.\nI was all busy with my work,\nso I wasn't really looking!
2	He could've come this way though.\nTry askin' someone else!
qst400805_ms.json
1	You're playing tag or something, right?\nI probably shouldn't help you, then.\nWouldn't be fair.
2	What? That kid's a thief?
3	Oh, right... He must be the one\nOtto was telling me about.
4	Otto the woodcutter keeps telling\nme he saw this boy hanging around\noutside of the town.
5	He always tells him to come back\ninto the town, 'cos it's not safe\noutside, but the boy just runs off.
6	That's about all I know, though.\nMaybe you should ask Otto himself?
7	You'll find him over at Nocclia\nTimber Site. Take care, now.
qst400806_ms.json
1	Oh, yeah! I definitely saw that kid.
2	Nimble little blighter he is, though.\nGets away from me every time!\nGahahahah!
3	I was just doing my work here,\nsame as usual, when I heard footsteps\ncoming from behind me.
4	So I turn around, and who do I see but\nthat boy! I called out to him to stop,\nbut he ran off even faster than usual.
5	If you ask me, that kid's not from\nTorigoth. Ain't no Torigoth kids have\nthe guts to come all the way out here.
6	'Fraid I couldn't tell you where he's\nheaded, mind. I'm too busy here to be\nchasing after kids all day.
7	Seeing as you've got Blades\nwith you, maybe you could try\ntracing the boy's tracks?
8	It was raining when he ran through\nhere, so if you follow his tracks,\nyou might find out where he went.
9	Oh, come on, don't tell me\nyou can't even follow tracks!\nAre you Drivers or what?
10	With such perfect timing for the rain,\nthey're bleeding obvious to anyone who\nworks in the forest like me...
11	But I guess you're amateurs when it\ncomes to forests, so I can't blame you!\nGahahah!
12	All right, shall I show you how it's\ndone? I'd be interested to find out\nwhere that boy's got to, as well.
13	What should we do?
14	Ask for help
15	Figure it out alone
16	Take a long, good look at the ground.
17	Footprints in the wet dirt, pieces of\ngrass stuck to the ground...
18	Look out for anything that seems\nunnatural, and if they're spaced evenly,\nthose'll be the tracks you're after.
19	What d'you think? You see it now?
20	You've got guts, I'll give you that.
21	But it might not be easy to find\nyourselves a Blade who can follow\ntracks, you know?
22	If you think it'll take too much time,\nyou can always ask me for help!
23	I may be busy, but I can still spare a\nfew moments to help folk in need\nof my skills.
24	You see the tracks, right?\nNow all you gotta do is follow 'em.
25	There's no excuse for thieving from\nfolk, but I feel like that kid might have\nsome reason for what he's doing.
26	Don't be too harsh on him, yeah?
qst400808_ms.json
1	Is this where the tracks end?
2	But this is...
qst400901_ms.json
1	Huh? You're...Periperi, right?
2	Ahhh! Rex!\nSuch coincidence to meet here!
3	You haven't brought any cargo\nfrom Gormott, have you?
4	Have so.
5	Even though you were in Argentum?
6	Came from Argentum to Gormott,\nthen Gormott to Mor Ardain!
7	Oh, I see... I guess that makes sense.
8	Then Tora have something\nto ask Periperi.
9	Did Periperi transport large quantity\nof Bion Connector recently?
10	Meh-meh-meh!\nTalking about contents of shipment\nis violation of trade confidentiality!
11	C'mon, we really need to know this.
12	Ahhhhh... If it request from Rex,\nPeriperi can not refuse!
13	Periperi carried Bion Connector\nin yellow barrels.
14	How many?
15	At least 10, Periperi think.
16	That's got to be it.
17	Periperi know where shipment for?
18	Sadly not having that information.\nJob was only bring cargo to port.
19	But cargo unloaded here always\ntaken off towards city.
20	Maybe friends find cargo at inspection\npoint near elevator. Only if recipient\nnot pick up yet, of course.
21	All right, we'll have a look.\nThanks, Periperi.
qst400902_ms.json
1	Yellow barrels with many\nBion Connector should be\nnearby to elevator.
2	About 10 of them close by to each\nother, so not difficult to spot!
3	Only probably though.
4	Yellow barrels not there any more?
5	Periperi very sorry...
6	That all of what Periperi know.\nSorry could not be more help...
qst400903_ms.json
1	Yellow barrels...
2	Yellow barrels...
3	Yellow barrels...
4	I can't see any.
5	Hmm... Weren't there some over there\nthe first time we came here?
6	Come to think of it, I do recall\nsomething of that nature.
7	According to memory of Poppi,\nyellow barrels were definitely there.
8	So that means...someone must have\npicked them up already?
9	I can only assume as much.
10	Well, that leaves us without any leads...
11	Aw, man...
12	Tora not about to give up so easy!
13	Tora remember there is junk shop in\nAlba Cavanich. We ask for info there?
14	Another rare good suggestion\nfrom Masterpon!
15	A junk shop, huh? Yeah, they might\nknow a thing or two about parts for\nartificial Blades.
16	Then what're we waiting for?
qst400904_ms.json
1	Sorry, but I don't do small talk with\npeople who aren't paying customers.
2	Maybe if you bought something,\nI'd be more willing to chat.
3	What do you say?
4	Cheapskates.
5	Well, if you're not paying,\nI'm not talking!
6	Thanks for your custom!\nAnd whaddaya know, I think\nI just remembered!
7	You're looking for an old bloke\nby the name of Timell.
8	He's in the business of transporting\nBlack Ash and other minerals mined\nin Mor Ardain.
9	Right now, you'll probably find\nhim at the Turbine Tower, just\nacross Midorl Bridge.
10	Be careful if you're going to\nmeet him, though.
qst400905_ms.json
1	So what were you wanting to ask?
2	Tora want to know if somebody bought\ncertain parts in large quantity or took\nthem to somebody.
3	When you say "certain parts"...
4	There quite many variety.\nTora list them one after another,\nso if any rings bell, please say.
5	Really? We're doing this again?
6	Tetra-Circle!
7	Snake Joint!
8	Black Ash!
9	Hold it! I do have some info\non that last one.
10	Meh-meh-meh?! Over already?!
11	Masterpon look disappointed...
12	All right!
13	Please, tell us the details.
14	This old guy said he had a regular\ncustomer purchasing Black Ash.
15	Pretty large-scale stuff, from the\nsounds of it. He was bragging about\nhow he'd be rolling in cash for a while.
16	Black Ash is key mineral used as\nshielding agent in ether furnace.
17	Sounds like we've got our guy.
18	Do you know where we can find\nthis old guy?
19	Hmmmmm...
20	Now, isn't that odd.\nI can't seem to recall.
21	Maybe if you bought something,\nit might jog my memory...
22	Why, you little...
qst400906_ms.json
1	Hmm? You want something?
2	Tora want to ask about Black Ash!
3	About Black Ash, eh? Lemme guess -\nIsset's been blabbing, has he?
4	That correct.
5	Honestly, that little punk...
6	But hey, it's not like I'm doing anything\nwrong. So sure, I'll tell you.
7	What d'you want to know?
8	Have you been selling large quantities\nof Black Ash to someone?
9	I dunno if I'd call it that large.\nJust a few barrels at a time,\nevery now and then.
10	If using as shielding agent for ether\nfurnace, maybe not need such large\nquantity all at once.
11	Oh, I see.
12	So could you tell us where you're\ndelivering these barrels to?
13	Near the entrance to the\nOld Industrial District.
14	I just drop the goods off where I'm\ntold to, so I haven't seen the buyer\nor anything.
15	Sounds suspicious.
16	You reckon?
17	They're reliable with their money,\nand they pay a fair price. Can't say\nI ever thought anything seemed off.
18	And after all, if you're going to build\nsomething outside the city, why bother\nhaving it carried inside?
19	Not to mention that meeting up in\nperson would mean having to schedule\na time that suits both people.
20	I guess that's a fair point, but still...
21	When's your next delivery?
22	Ten days' time.
23	Seriously? We have to wait that long?
24	Perhaps we should simply enjoy an\nextended hot spring vacation.
25	Would that not be...\nless than productive?
26	Well, I only just made the last\ndelivery. If you head there quick,\nit might even still be there!
27	Tell us these things first!
28	Come on, guys, it's worth a try!
29	Are the barrels easy to spot?
30	Yeah, they should be pretty obvious.\nThey're bright green, after all.
31	Lemme know if there's anything\nelse you want sorting out.
qst400907_ms.json
1	Green barrels... This must be it!
2	And hey, aren't those the yellow\nbarrels from before?
3	Bion Connectors and Black Ash...
4	Materials for constructing artificial\nBlades, without a doubt.
5	The only question is, where are\nthey going to be taken next?
6	Are there any clues lying around?
7	There is note here written in Nopon.
8	This Nopon writing, yes...\nBut handwriting unbelievably scruffy.\nTora not able to read.
9	Is like baby scribbles.
10	Neither of you can read it?\nWow. That really must be bad.
11	I suppose we will simply have to\ndecipher it somehow...
12	That's one option, but would it not\nbe easier to simply keep watch on\nthe barrels themselves?
13	You say that, but we have no idea\nwhen the recipient will pick them up.
14	Yeah, what if they don't show up\nfor five days or something?
15	This sounds like the perfect mission\nto leave to our mercenary allies.
16	That would be an option, too.
17	Which shall we go for, then?
qst400908_ms.json
1	Meh-meh-meh... Tora can read!\nManage to read writing!
2	"As usual..."
3	"...deliver goods..."
4	"...to certain facility..."
5	"...around chest area..."
6	"...of Mor Ardain Titan."
7	That doesn't seem very specific...
8	But at least now we know the\ngeneral area.
9	Perhaps it's time we reported\nback to Mòrag.
10	Tora tell Mòrag how Tora was\nkey to investigation success!
11	Will demand three year supply\nof Tasty Sausage!
12	Don't get too carried away with\nyourself there.
13	With that much Tasty Sausage,\nMasterpon not need to work for\nrest of life!
14	The rest of his life?\nWith a three-year supply?
15	Anyway!
16	If we head to the palace, the guards\nshould get us in touch with Mòrag.
17	Yes, that was what she said.\nShall we, then?
qst400909_ms.json
1	Destination of goods identified!
2	So it looks like they're being taken to\na facility around the Mor Ardain Titan's\nchest area, huh...?
3	Indeed. Apparently a number of\nNopon came and carried the barrels\noff in that direction.
4	Perhaps it is time we reported our\nfindings to the Flamebringer.
5	Yes, good idea.
6	If we visit the palace, the guards\nshould take us to her, as I recall?
7	That was the agreement.
8	Here's hoping we don't get surrounded\nand attacked again, instead.
9	Hahaha...
10	That's...not a funny thought.
qst400910_ms.json
1	I always deliver the Black Ash to\nthe Old Industrial District.
2	Right near the entrance.\nThe barrels are green, so they\nshouldn't be hard to spot.
qst401001_ms.json
1	In the current climate, I fear\nalmost anything could happen.
2	I can scarcely wait for the day when\nthat huge, awful Titan battleship is\ngone from our shores.
3	It pains me to even see such an\nunsightly structure in our beautiful city.
4	I am sure all upstanding Indoline\ncitizens resent its presence.
5	Why can Mor Ardain and Uraya not\ncease all this foolish conflict and simply\nsubmit themselves to the will of Indol?
qst401002_ms.json
1	Well, um, I saw these weird\nbird people.
2	Not like Nopon, a bit bigger than that,\nand really, um, birdy-looking!
3	I think I saw pictures of them before\nin a picture book, but I can't remember\nwhat they're called...
4	Tirkin, maybe?
5	Gotta be Tirkin, right?
6	Sound like Tirkin to Tora!
7	Tirkin, right?
8	That's it!\nThey're called Tirkin!
9	Thanks, that was really bugging me...
10	But what would a bunch of Tirkin\nbe doing in a place like this?
qst401003_ms.json
1	I do wonder...
2	Myself, I am Ardainian, yet I live\nunder the protection of Indol.
3	And the Urayans and Gormotti\nhere, for instance, seem to get\nalong just as well.
4	But just take a look at those lot.
5	Clutching their tools of conflict,\nand fixing one another with the\ncoldest of stares...
6	They can't even have a civil discussion\nshort of holding a banquet like this.
7	Don't you think it's absurd?
8	If they have the time to be wasting on\nsuch extravagances, they should use\nit to save their own suffering people.
9	It does frustrate me. Sometimes I think\nthe people running those nations could\nlearn a thing or two from our camp.
qst401004_ms.json
1	Oh, I have a good one for you.
2	Some kind of ingredients with a\nmonstrously foul odor were carried\ninto the Ardainian Titan vessel.
3	The stench was so strong, I can\nstill smell it on my clothes.
4	There were other ingredients, too.\nWeird and wonderful, the lot of them.
5	I don't know what they're for, but\nit can't be your average recipes.
qst401005_ms.json
1	There was one request I thought\nwas decidedly suspicious.
2	We had a Nopon fellow asking about\nsupplies of poisonous substances.
3	I told him we do not handle such items\nhere, of course, and he left soon after.
4	But from what I hear, he's been\nasking around other places too.
5	Who knows what he might be plotting?
qst401006_ms.json
1	There's certainly something\nnot quite right going on.
2	I saw a very large wooden box being\ntransported on to the Titan battleship.
3	It was accounted for on the\ninventory list, so most of my\ncolleagues think it's no problem.
4	But I honestly can't imagine what\nthey would want such a huge box for.\nI'm worried about what might be inside.
qst401007_ms.json
1	Problems at the summit?\nA ridiculous notion!
2	The summit will be held aboard this\nTitan battleship, so we have no need\nto fear attacks from the outside.
3	This door is the only entrance, and it\nwill not be opened until just before the\nsummit, to admit Queen Raqura.
4	We have not allowed a single suspicious\nindividual to pass this point.
5	As such, there is no need to fear\nattack from within, either!
qst401008_ms.json
1	Nothing untoward is going on\nin the Ardainian army, I assure you.
2	Those who have come to Indol belong\nto the Carraig Imperial Guard.
3	Elite soldiers who have sworn solemn\noaths to protect the Emperor.
4	So if anything suspicious were\ngoing on, I'd venture it would have\nto be on the Urayan side...
5	I find it difficult to tell what those\npeople are thinking sometimes.
qst401009_ms.json
1	The Ardainian Titan battleship has\nextremely sturdy defenses.
2	I doubt there's a single weapon in this\nwhole port that could damage it.
3	Besides, I hear the main conference\nwill only be attended by a very select\ngroup of trustworthy individuals.
4	I can't imagine how any miscreant\ncould hope to get close to the VIPs\nto harm them, even if they wanted to.
5	A lot of people are on edge, but I don't\nthink there's anything to worry about.
qst401010_ms.json
1	Perhaps there are untoward\nintentions on the Mor Ardain side.\nFrankly, I would expect it.
2	But I can assure you that we\nof Uraya have no intentions of\ntrying anything funny.
3	The word of Queen Raqura is absolute.
4	We trust in our Queen, and as she wills\nit, we gladly put our weapons aside.
5	So there is no need for concern.
6	...Of course, if the Queen ordered me to\ntake up arms, I would gladly fight tooth\nand nail against those Ardainian dogs.
7	You would do well not to forget that.
qst401011_ms.json
1	We've gathered quite a bit of\ninformation now.
2	Yeah, and plenty of it blatantly bogus.\nBut there were some rumors in there\nthat did bug me a bit...
3	Time to sort out the real dirt\nfrom the baseless suspicion.
4	Ooh, detective time!
5	First, we clear up basic premise.\nWho is targeting summit of nations?
6	Is former Chairman Bana.\nMasterpon forget already?
7	N-no! Tora not that stupid!
8	Is traditional for deducings to start by\nlisting information everybody know!
9	Proper flow is for Rex-Rex to think\ncarefully and provide answer!
10	OK, OK...
11	On to the next basic premise, then.\nWhere is the summit to be held?
12	Hmmm...
13	Where is the summit being held?
14	The Sanctum of Indol
15	The Ardainian Titan battleship
16	Inside the Sanctum of Indol, right?
17	Uh, no, that's where we had the\nLAST big meeting.
18	This summit is between the leaders\nof Mor Ardain and Uraya alone. They\nwould hardly hold it under Indol's nose.
19	It's inside the Titan battleship from\nMor Ardain.
20	Yes, that's right.
21	It seems like Bana is planning an\nassassination, but what method do\nyou think he might be using?
22	What's the assassination method?
23	Sinking the whole battleship
24	Stabbing
25	Poison
26	Wasn't there a rumor that he might\nsink the whole Titan battleship?
27	What?! That terrible!
28	We must get Mòrag out of there\nat once!
29	Hold on, hold on.\nI don't remember any rumors like that.
30	Actually, weren't people saying the\nArdainian battleship's so tough nobody\nwould be able to harm it?
31	Huh? Now that you mention it,\nmaybe that was what they said...
32	Let's try this again.
33	There might be a spy lurking inside,\nready to stab the target!
34	Oh, Tora remember that rumor!
35	Guards say ninja spy ready to stab\nEmperor and Queen at moment of\nhandshake! Very dramatic!
36	Poppi think Masterpon been\ndozing off and dreaming.
37	Yes, I don't recall any rumors\nof that nature.
38	Meh-meh-meh?!
39	Actually, didn't we hear that only a\nselect few trustworthy people would\nbe attending from both sides?
40	No need to worry about ninja\nspies, then.
41	C'mon, Rex, at least try to think things\nthrough before you speak.
42	Sorry...
43	I think...the method might be poison.
44	Yeah...the ship's totally secure from\nthe outside, and only trustworthy\npeople will be attending, after all.
45	I guess the only method that really\nleaves is tampering with the food.
46	But when would the poison be added?\nAnd to what, exactly?
47	What exactly will be poisoned?
48	The main meal at the banquet
49	The drinking water for the conference
50	Maybe they'll contaminate the\ndrinking water at the conference?
51	But did we not hear that the main\nconference would only be attended\nby select trustworthy individuals?
52	It might be possible to contaminate\nthe water supply before the conference\nbegins, might it not?
53	If it were me, I wouldn't even drink\nany water at a conference like that.
54	Can't be too careful around people\nyou don't know very well.
55	Is that how it works?
56	Maybe there's a more effective method.
57	It's got to be the meal at the\nbanquet, right?
58	Yes, I can hardly imagine the VIPs will\nbe preparing their own food.
59	I'd quite like to see Mòrag and Brighid\ntry cooking for a banquet...
60	And someone was saying they'd\nseen lots of weird ingredients\nbeing carried inside, right?
61	Indeed they were.
62	Suspicious big box carried inside too!
63	Could the strong-flavored ingredients\nbe to hide the taste of the poison?
64	You're sharp, Rex.\nI'd bet that's exactly what they're for.
65	The only question left is, who will\nbe carrying out the poisoning itself?
66	Let's see, now...
67	Who will be poisoning the food?
68	The refugees
69	The Tirkin
70	The people of Indol
71	The refugees seemed pretty angry.
72	Can you blame them? It is thanks to\nthe conflict between Mor Ardain and\nUraya that they have no homes.
73	A summit between the two nations\nwill hardly amuse them.
74	It's not hard to imagine Bana taking\nadvantage of that resentment.
75	How would the refugees get near the\nbanquet food to poison it, though?
76	Hmmm... Good point.
77	Could it be those Tirkin?
78	The ones that girl was talking about?
79	Bana use Tirkin as minions before!\nTora remember from artificial Blade\nfactory in Mor Ardain!
80	I can see how they might be more\nconvenient for him than hiring\nprofessional assassins, then...
81	Yeah, but you think Tirkin know\nthe first thing about cooking?
82	I don't know about that...
83	Could it be the Indoline citizens?
84	They certainly didn't seem happy\nabout the whole situation.
85	Poppi think they seem to not like\nArdainians and Urayans very much.
86	I can see where they're coming from\nthere, but do you really think they'd\nactually try to assassinate anyone?
87	The people of Indol are not known\nfor desiring conflict.
88	Hmmm... Who could it be, then?
89	Listen, I think we're just going\naround in circles here.
90	If we know somebody's probably\ngonna poison the food, why don't we\ngo check out the battleship itself?
91	Good point. Regardless of who's\ncarrying it out, we should act fast\nif we're going to stop this plot.
92	That settled then! Everybody go to\ndining hall of Ardainian battleship!
qst501701_ms.json
1	I was lucky to escape Indol with my\nlife intact. I'd love to regale you with\nthe thrilling tale of my daring escape...
2	But I suppose we should talk business.\nEveryone needs money to live, after all.
qst501706_ms.json
1	From where I'm standing, I get to hear\nall kinds of gossip - from tourists, from\nrefugees, from the clergymen...
2	So tell me - what would you\nlike to know?
qst502003_ms.json
1	...
qst502008_ms.json
1	Hey, that weird machine is pretty\nunusual, right?
2	It was hauled up by a salvager,\nbut nobody knows what it's for.
3	My dad reckons it's not broken or\nanything, but he can't figure out\nwhat to do with it.
4	Apparently a lot of these salvaged\nmachines start working when you\ngive them lightning energy.
5	But nobody in Argentum has enough\nlightning energy to make this one work.
6	If you think you can do better,\nwhy not give it a try?
7	I wonder what that weird machine\nwould do if it started working?
8	My dad reckons it's not broken or\nanything, but he's at a loss as to\nwhat it's actually for.
9	You guys can make it work using\nlightning energy, right?
10	It should make for an exciting evening!
qst502009_ms.json
1	How is this machine supposed to work?
2	I've seen a lot of salvaged machinery\nin my time, but nothing quite like this.
3	I suppose this thing might work\nif it were fed a stable flow of\nlightning energy...
4	We'd need someone with an enormous\nsupply of lightning energy, and the\nability to control it very precisely.
5	If you're going to try it out, be sure to\ndo it at night. It's dangerous during the\nday with so many people around.
qst502011_ms.json
1	I think you almost had it there,\nyou know. I'm sure I heard this\nmachine almost start functioning.
2	But an instant later, it stopped\ncompletely.
3	Do you think it could be linked\nto the supply of lightning energy?
4	It's the only explanation.
5	It was only supplied with lightning\nenergy for an instant, so it could only\nactivate for an instant.
6	But if we could provide it with a\nconstant flow of lightning energy...
7	It might work for real!
8	Of course, there's no telling what\nit will actually do once it activates.
9	It could be pretty dangerous with all\nthe people around during the day.\nLet's test it out at night.
10	A good call, I think.\nSounds like a plan.
qst502013_ms.json
1	Young maiden of lightning!\nPrithee tarry awhile.
2	Um...are you talking to me?
3	Thou wieldest great strength in the\nways of lightning, dost thou not?
4	Well, um...I do use lightning, but...\nI'm a bit crap at controlling it.
5	No matter, no matter. Might I beg\nof thee to demonstrate thy skill?
6	I too am a disciple of the ways of\nlightning, yet the limits of my skill\nweigh down upon my soul.
7	Witnessing the arts of a fellow disciple\nmay provide me the inspiration I seek.
8	Oh, all right then.\nWatch this!
9	Thy strength is truly remarkable.\nWords fail me!
10	With such strength, thou shalt surely\nbe able to protect those dear to thee.
11	Protect...those dear to me?
12	Yea, verily. Would only that I were\npossessed of such strength as thee.
13	I must hone my skills yet further.
14	Thou hast my gratitude, fair maiden.\nAnd now, I must away.
15	Ohhh, I really don't think I have enough\nskills to demonstrate... I'm so sorry!
qst502014_ms.json
1	Um...is something the matter here?
2	Ookiooki just arrive here at Leftheria\nislands. Tour guide Sulala here was\nmeant to showing Ookiooki around.
3	But Sulala get even more excity than\nOokiooki! Sulala slip and hit head!
4	...
5	Well, that's not good at all!\nI'll go fetch a doctor.
6	Wait please! Too late now for doctor!\nSulala heart already stop beating!
7	Could friend use lightning power to\nstart heart of Sulala again?!
8	Whaaaaa?!
9	Is no time for hesitate!\nEvery second, life of Sulala is slip away!
10	Oohhhhhh...\nI guess I'll just have to try!
11	Meh-meh-meh!!!
12	Big success!
13	Whew-whew! Sulala get so excity\nthere, felt like caught a glimpse of\nElysium for a moment!
14	Now, where was we? Come along\nOokiooki, lots to see in Leftheria!
15	Wait one moment!
16	Sulala must saying thank you\nto this nice person.
17	Saying thank you?
18	Sulala not really understand,\nbut thank you friend!
19	Ummm... That's OK.\nJust as long as you're all right.
20	Friend is savior of life of Sulala!\nThank you friend!
21	It looks like I just don't have\nthe power to do this...
22	I'm so sorry!
qst502015_ms.json
1	What seems to be the problem here?
2	Well, it's this pond. It's got an\ninfestation of nasty bugs.
3	I want to get rid of them to protect the\nfish living here, but some of the fish are\npretty small, so I can't use insecticides.
4	If someone could pass a delicate flow\nof lightning energy through the water,\nI thought that might get rid of them.
5	But there aren't many people\nwho can...
6	Um, actually you look pretty lightningy.
7	Ah, you noticed?
8	Do you think you could manage it?\nGetting rid of just the nasty bugs,\nwhile leaving the fish unharmed?
9	Well, I'm not really used to that\nkind of delicate control...
10	I might end up giving the fish\na nasty shock as well.
11	Don't be like that.\nGive it a try, at least!
12	Ohhhh... All right, I'll see what I can do!
13	You see? I knew you could do it!
14	Now this pond will be safe and healthy!\nThe fish look happier already!
15	I'm glad I could be of help!
16	You really are a star.\nThanks so much!
17	Ahhhh, it's no good!\nI can't do this!
18	I just know we'll end up with a lake\ncovered in fried fish, belly up!
qst502016_ms.json
1	What can I help you with here?
2	Well! You certainly look like\na fine, strong Blade!
3	I-I'd rather you didn't stare...
4	Sorry, sorry...
5	It's your power of lightning\nthat I'm after.
6	Oh...I'm not sure if I can help you there.\nI don't have very good control over my\nenergy, you see...
7	That's no problem at all.
8	I just want you to help me test the\ninsulating armor I'm working on.
9	No need to hold anything back.\nJust give it a full-on blast, and\nwe'll see how well it holds up!
10	Well, if that's all, I guess I can\ngive it a shot!
11	Wait, I have to aim it at you?!
12	Well, yes. There's not much\npoint otherwise.
13	Don't worry, I'm quite confident\nin this armor's insulating ability.
14	Give me everything you've got!
15	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]I should probably try to hold back\nat least a little, though...
16	Here goes nothing!
17	Hahaha!\nLooks like there's still plenty of\nwork to be done on this armor!
18	Thank goodness you're alive...
19	No need to feel down, my girl.\nThat's a wonderful power you have!
20	One day, I swear I'll build an armor\nthat can block it out completely!
21	I hope you'll help me test it out\nagain once that day comes.
22	O-OK!
23	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]If I really go all-out on him, though,\nit'll probably be back to square one...
24	Ahhhhh, no no no no!\nI can't do this after all!
25	I don't have the courage to aim\nmy attacks at an innocent person!
qst502017_ms.json
1	You look pretty tired, Chancellor.\nWould you like me to give you a\nshoulder massage?
2	Why, that's very kind of you.\nI'd appreciate it, thank you.
3	Here goes nothing, then!
4	Ahhhhhh, that was the best\nmassage I've ever had!
5	I think that tingly sparking sensation\nmay have given my old joints a whole\nnew lease on life!
6	My granddaughter's massages always\nmake me feel like I'm a year younger...
7	But yours make me feel like\nI've lost at least twenty!
8	Well, I'm happy you liked it so much!\nWould you like me to do it again?
9	That's a very tempting proposition,\nbut I wouldn't want to keep you for\ntoo long.
10	Besides, if I were to lose forty years,\nI'd be younger than His Majesty!
11	Hahahah!
12	...
13	N-no, that's quite all right, thank you!\nI have a feeling something terrible\nwill happen if I accept!
14	Oh... Well, if you're sure!

1	Hey, lady! Get a load of this!
2	Apparently light and sound travel at\ndifferent speeds! Can you believe that?!
3	Oh? That's pretty interesting.
4	It's true! I read it in a book!\nAlthough...I'm still not sure I believe it.
5	It was a pretty cheap old book.\nThey probably just made it up.
6	...Maybe we could test it out?
7	Like, an experiment?!\nCan you do that?!
8	I'll stand somewhere far away and\nmake a thunderbolt. Then you check if\nyou see and hear it at different times!
9	Sounds like fun!
10	OK, hang on. I'll go outside the village.\nYou wait right here!
11	Whoa, that's amazing!
12	The sound really did come later!\nLight must be faster than sound!
13	You're pretty amazing, you know that?\nThat thunderbolt was so perfect for\nthis experiment!
14	Heheheh... I'm glad I could help.
15	Yeah! Thanks!
16	She's sure taking her time...
17	Huh?
18	Nothing's happening...
19	I'm sorry... I don't seem to be able\nto summon a decent lightning bolt\nright now.
20	Hey, that's OK! Let me know when\nyou're feeling more confident!

5	Even now, I imagine more\nsurvivors are gathering to\nenact vengeance on us.
6	Hmm. You could be right.
7	When a plant is rotten you\nneed to drag it up by the roots.
8	Look, it's all very well to guess\nabout more surviviors, but we\ndon't know where they are.
9	I'm sure these vermin will tell us\nwith a little persuasion.
10	This won't take long.
11	H-hey! Hold on!
qst650103_ms.json
1	Urk-
2	What's the plan you mentioned?\nStart talking or die.
3	If you think I'll sing, you don't\nknow me very well, lady!
4	The location of your friends will suffice.
5	Just tell me and this will all go away.
6	Agh!
7	...
8	Worthless.
qst650104_ms.json
1	Ack-
2	What's the plan you mentioned?\nStart talking or die.
3	Do your worst. I'll never tell you.
4	The location of your friends will suffice.
5	Just tell me and this will all go away.
6	Urgh-
7	Grha-
8	Is...Is that all you've got?\nI'm...disappointed...
9	You sick little rat.
10	Gwaagh-
11	...
qst650105_ms.json
1	Blegh-
2	What's the plan you mentioned?\nStart talking or die.
3	What will you...\nWhat will you do if I tell you?
4	I'll eradicate every last one of you.
5	Heh...heh...
6	Well in that case...
7	The survivors of Indol are...
8	gathering in Mor Ardain...in the\nChansagh Wastes.
9	By our power combined, we will\ndo Praetor Amalthus proud!
10	Preparations are almost complete.\nFinding you lot was to be the final step.\nBy all means, save us the trouble!
11	That's enough from you.
12	Guagh-
13	...
14	We must head for Mor Ardain.
15	It seems we must.
16	Sounds like we'll have to stop\ntheir plot the hard way, eh?
17	Let's go!
18	But, er, try to restrain yourself a\nbit, yeah, T-elos?
19	Pfft. As if...
qst650106_ms.json
1	Looks like the information you got out\nof that goon was right on the money.
2	What's our move, chaps?
3	Well, we've established that we're the\ntargets. I'd say this is our problem to\ndeal with.
4	We shouldn't just rush in...
5	Nonsense. They are enemies.\nOur directive is clear.
6	T-elos?
7	That girl!
8	Looks like you're not finished yet.
9	Did you really think you were going\nto be able to take down the Aegis\nand her companions?
10	Who are you?
11	We've been preempted!
12	Not so. This just saves us the effort\nof chasing the Aegis down.
13	These fools are nothing but moths\neager for the flame.
14	Soon enough, the other survivors of\nIndol will be arriving here.
15	If we can hold out until then, the hour\nof our vengeance will soon be at hand!
16	Heh.\nRisible.
17	I suppose all you worms\nthink the same.
18	You think your threats are anything\nmore than the chitter of vermin?
19	You're only one Blade!\nDon't underestimate our power!
20	Get her!
21	Don't get in my way.\nI plan on enjoying this.
qst650107_ms.json
1	Curse you.
2	Is that all you had?
3	Look sharp! Reinforcements!
4	Can't these guys give us a moment\nto catch our breath?
5	Pfft. Weakling Drivers.
6	Bit harsh, T-elos!
7	It seems we arrived late.
8	We cannot wait for the others.\nWe must avenge our fallen comrades\nourselves.
9	Praise to Amalthus!\nLet us crush these heretics!
10	These guys just don't give up, do they?
11	They sure take after Amalthus.
12	More's the pity.
13	These ones look to be considerably\ntougher than their compatriots. I\nadvise caution, T-elos.
14	Duly noted.
qst650108_ms.json
1	More of these guys?!
2	These blighters just don't know when to quit, do they?
3	Hmm... They do have the numbers though...
4	T-elos, what...?
5	Come.\nI'll put you out of your misery.
6	Worthless maggots, this place will be your grave.
7	D-damn you!
8	Miserable weaklings...\nDid you think you'd be a match for me?
9	[ML:undisp ]!! (adlib getting stomped on)
10	Whoa!
11	Ruthless as always, I see...
12	T-elos, you alright?
13	Completely.
14	Thanks for that!
15	That would've taken a lot longer\nwithout you, T-elos...
16	Though I do wish you'd stop showing off.
17	Your concern is pointless.
18	Battle is what Blades are born for.
19	No need to waste your worries on me.
20	Even if it sometimes seems like that's\nwhat you Drivers are born for...
21	No, look...
22	So what, showing concern for our friends\nis useless, is that what you're saying?
23	Keep talking - I'll stomp you.\nJust like I did that last maggot...
24	Freaky...
25	Oh, I give up.\nYou really are something else, T-elos.
26	Don't think I've ever seen a Blade like you...
27	At least there is no doubting her prowess.
28	Her assistance has proven invaluable.
29	You're right. She's good to have around.
30	We'll keep counting on you, all right T-elos?
31	Hmph...
32	Ahah...ha...
33	I'm sure she'll warm to us eventually...
qst650109_ms.json
1	Hey, T-elos, can I ask you something?
2	You're obviously really powerful.\nBut wouldn't it be even more effective\nto work with us instead of alone?
3	I am working with you.
4	Well, technically, I suppose...
5	What's the issue?
6	Fighting is a tough business.\nI understand that you gotta be,\ny'know, merciless or whatever.
7	But outside of battle...\nI wish you'd just relax and\nhave fun with us sometimes.
8	Drivers and Blades can support each\nother in a bunch of ways. Not just\nduring battle, you know?
9	I understand.
10	Your concerns have been noted.
11	However, there is no reason to\nalter my present behavior.
12	Somehow I knew you'd say that...
13	Heh.
14	I shall consider whether your\nsuggestion could be implemented\nin future.
15	Thanks T-elos!\nThat's good enough for me.
16	Hey, T-elos, can I ask something?
17	You're super powerful and all that,\nbut don't you think it'd be better\nto work with us instead of alone?
18	I am working with you.
19	Well, I guess...
20	What's the issue?
21	Look, I get that you gotta do\nyour serious thing during battle.
22	But outside of battle, it'd be nice\nif you could just kick back and\nspend time with the rest of us.
23	Drivers and Blades can support each\nother in a bunch of ways. Not just\nduring battle, you know?
24	I understand.
25	Your concerns have been noted.
26	However, there is no reason to\nalter my present behavior.
27	I knew you'd say that...
28	Heh.
29	I shall consider whether your\nsuggestion could be implemented\nin future.
30	That's all I could ask for!\nCheers, T-elos!
31	I have a question, T-elos.
32	You are very powerful. No doubt about\nit. But don't you think it would be even\nmore effective to work with us?
33	I am working with you.
34	Well, yes...
35	What's the issue?
36	Like you, I cannot abide foolishness\nduring battle. Trust me on that.
37	But I learned something traveling\nwith Rex and the others.
38	Drivers and Blades can support each\nother in a myriad ways. Outside of\nbattle, too - not just while fighting.
39	I understand.
40	Your concerns have been noted.
41	However, there is no reason to\nalter my present behavior.
42	Perhaps you do not, in fact,\nunderstand.
43	Heh.
44	I shall consider whether your\nsuggestion could be implemented\nin the future.
45	My thanks.\nThat will have to do.
46	T-elos, got a bit of a question for ya.
47	You're pretty powerful and all that,\nbut wouldn't it be better if you...\nworked with us a bit more?
48	I am working with you.
49	Yeah, I suppose so...
50	What's the issue?
51	Look, everyone knows that one of\nthe jobs of a Blade is to protect\ntheir Driver.
52	But that's only part of it. You're our\nmate, T-elos. There's more to being\npart of the team than just fighting.
53	Drivers and Blades can support each\nother in a bunch of other ways.
54	I understand.
55	Your concerns have been noted.
56	However, there is no reason to\nalter my present behavior.
57	I had a feeling you'd say that.
58	Heh.
59	I shall consider whether your\nsuggestion could be implemented\nin the future.
60	Cheers, T-elos.\nNot much more I can ask.
61	T-elos. Your foolhardy actions before\nwere inexcusable.
62	Heh. It's amusing to hear that from you.
63	I act efficiently according to the best\nanalysis of the data. You act according\nto your own reckless desires.
64	Your treatment of those people was\nunwarranted.
65	We are simply incompatible, you and I.\nIt is pointless trying to see eye to eye.
66	Acknowledged.
67	But our goals are aligned.
68	Unfortunately, you have a point.
69	If we encounter a similar situation in\nthe future, I advise working together\nto resolve it.
70	Heh.
71	Aw, T-elos and KOS-MOS, it's great to\nsee you guys getting along!
72	I do not think we are getting along.
73	Agreed. "Getting along" is the opposite\nof what we're doing.
74	See?
75	...
76	...
77	Aw, T-elos and KOS-MOS, it's great to\nsee you guys settling your differences!
78	I do not think we are settling our\ndifferences.
79	Agreed. Our differences are\nirreconcilable.
80	See? Two peas in a pod.
81	...
82	...
83	T-elos and KOS-MOS, you are\nsurprisingly similar.
84	I do not think we are similar.
85	Agreed. Our differences are\nirreconcilable.
86	See what I mean?
87	...
88	...
89	T-elos and KOS-MOS, it's great to\nsee you guys settling your differences.
90	I do not think we are settling our\ndifferences.
91	Agreed. Our differences are\nirreconcilable.
92	See? Two peas in a pod.

10	Well, I say that, but don't worry. You\ncan always come back here any time\nyou think it's getting hairy.
11	It's not as if we're heading off to war\nor anything.

1	According to Adenine, this says...
2	"Something-or-other Park Car Park...\nAnd a bunch of other stuff I can't read."
3	...Er, maybe she took a few liberties\nwith the translation.
4	I guess this hill used to be a park, huh?
5	According to Adenine, this says...
6	"Something-or-other Park Car Park...\nAnd a bunch of other stuff I can't read."
7	...Something tells me that's not\nEXACTLY what it says, but whatever.
8	I guess this place used to be a park...?
9	According to Adenine, this say...
10	"Something-or-other Park Car Park...\nAnd a bunch of other stuff I can't read."
11	Tora think Adenine not reading\nvery carefully.
12	But maybe this hill used to be park?
13	According to Adenine, this says...
14	"Something-or-other Park Car Park".
15	Somehow I doubt that is the\nactual name.
16	I suppose this hill Rex saw in his dream\nused to be some kind of park...
17	According to Adenine, this says...
18	"Something-or-other Park Car Park...\nAnd a bunch of other stuff I can't read."
19	...Yeah, I'm sure that's EXACTLY\nwhat it says.
20	Maybe if we polished this sign up a bit,\nshe'd be able to read it better...
21	This looks like some kind of sign,\nbut I can't read any of the writing...
22	Who knows what all this writing's\nsupposed to mean...
23	Very flat thing with words written on!\nBut Tora not know what words say...
24	This panel is incredibly thin...\nyet somehow also very sturdy.\nWhat remarkable craftsmanship...
25	Looks like an explanation of this place\nor something. Pity I can't read it.
26	レックスで調べた場合
27	So this is...Elysium...?
28	Uhh... No use pondering it now.\nLet's keep moving.
29	When investigate by Nia
30	Is this Elysium...?
31	It kind of looks like Morytha to me...
32	When investigate by Tora
33	This place feel very lonely place...\nCan place like this really be Elysium?
34	Marvelous technology used here,\nbut not look hospitable for living, meh...
35	When investigate by Mòrag
36	Is this really Elysium?
37	A place more barren than Mor Ardain...\nThe mind reels.
38	When investigate by Zeke
39	We've done well to make it this far...\nWho knew this is what was waiting.
tlk0000059201_ms.json
1	What could this building have been for?\nIt seems to have lots of shelves for\nstoring things...
2	This looks like a pipe organ...
3	But it's not making any sound now...
4	These shelves are perfectly spaced for\nclimbing... No! I have to resist the urge!
5	Wow, that's a huge organ.
6	Oh, but it's busted... Shame,\nI wanted to play a little tune.
7	Meh-meh! This building so big!\nIs big mansion for royal people maybe?
8	Oh! This look like organ!
9	Some things same here as in world\nof Tora and friends...
10	This place seems almost like a gigantic\nmarket. Did people gather here to trade\ngoods long ago?
11	The organ... How majestic it must have\nsounded, before...
12	What're these things? Shelves?\nI guess it's some kind of shop.
13	But what the heck kind of shop is\nbigger than our royal throne room...?
14	Hm, no go. Won't make a sound...
15	Sad, really. If it was still working,\nI could have given everyone a taste of\nthe Zekenator's Fifth...
tlk0000059301_ms.json
1	Is this where the people who lived in\nElysium would come to play?
2	I don't really get how to use\nany of these...
3	How do you use these things?
4	Are they like, training equipment\nor something?
5	Meh-meh-meh? What this place for?
6	Training ground for Drivers maybe?
7	Was this...some kind of park, perhaps?
8	I have never seen anything like these\nstructures in the records of Alrest...
9	I guess this is like, a park.
10	But everything here's super sturdy.\nNot made out of wood, that's for sure.
tlk0000059401_ms.json
1	This looks like...a water tower?
2	Maybe this place used to be covered\nin trees and flowers like Gormott...
3	This is a water tower, right?\nWhat's one of those doing here?
4	Tora seen tower like this in Gormott!
5	Was Elysium like Gormott\nlong time ago?
6	I suppose the people of Elysium\nstored their water supply in towers,\njust like we do ourselves.
7	Perhaps our societies were not as\ndifferent as they might seem.
8	If it was in Alrest, I'd say this was\nfor storing water...
9	But who knows what the people\nliving here might've stored in it.
tlk0000059501_ms.json
1	These strange boxes... I've seen things\nlike them before from time to time,\nwhen I was salvaging.
2	I always thought they were some kind\nof houses, but what would houses be\ndoing on roads?
3	Looks like there's no way through...
4	I wonder what's past here...
5	It's the highest point of all Alrest,\nbut there's so much space...\nIt's kinda unbelievable.
6	These weird boxes... They pop up all\nover the place in Elysium.
7	What the heck were they for, though?
8	No way past, it seems...
9	Such a massive space...\nHow did people get around it...?
10	Meh-meh-meh!\nThis made out of steel?
11	No...seems a bit stronger than steel,\nand lighter too! Very intriguing!
12	Bunch of rubble?\nIt no match for Poppi's power!
13	...Ah, no, Tora take it back.\nPlease pay no mind to Tora.
14	Tora realize, only thing we find\nbehind rubble is more rubble...
15	These boxes are quite unfamiliar, but\nsomething about them reminds me of\nthe imperial weapon called Cetus.
16	Perhaps they are some manner\nof vehicle?
17	To make such a great gaping hole in\nthe rock wall... Incredible...
18	The technology here gives one pause...\nBut it was still no match for the power\nof time passing.
19	Hey, these things aren't going to\nstart moving or anything, right?
20	They look kind of like those weird\nmachines we saw in Morytha and\nthe World Tree...
21	The construction of this wall reminds\nme of the sturdy walls of Theosoir...
22	But even beyond it, I'm sure nothing is\nwaiting other than more rubble-strewn\ndesolation, same as here...

8	Very well. Feel free to come back\nwhenever you are ready to retire.
tlk00120103_ms.json
1	The evacuation of the civilians\nis proceeding steadily.
2	But I ask that you repair the Omega\nFetter, if possible.
3	Save Genbu...save Tantal.
4	You are now the only ones on\nwhom we can rely... Do you think\nyou can do this for us?
tlk00120105_ms.json
1	I did a terrible thing to you, and for\nthat, I must apologize.
2	The third Aegis sword that unlocks the\ntrue power of the Aegis is said to be\nsealed away somewhere in Leftheria.
3	The power of the Aegis,\nI entrust to you...
4	Zeke. I trust you will guide the Aegis\non her mission, and act as bodyguard\nto the boy.
5	I saw a determination in his eyes,\na hope that shone so brilliantly...\nThat is something we cannot lose.
6	Sure thing.\nJust leave it to the Zekenator!
7	Still as immature as always, I see.\nWhen are you going to grow up?
8	Uhuh. Never heard that one before...
tlk00120106_ms.json
1	You've returned with the Aegis and\nthe third sword in hand, I see.
2	Which means that your next port of\ncall will be your last: the World Tree.
3	I wish you a safe journey to Elysium.
4	You'd better be pulling your own\nweight, Zeke.
5	Yes, thanks for that, father.\nI think you've drilled that into me\nenough for me to realize.
6	I very much hope so.
7	If I were a few years younger, I would\nhave joined you, but it was not to be.
8	Some king you are...
tlk00120107_ms.json
1	To think that they were controlling\nGenbu itself...
2	No more Core Chips were being\nproduced, so there was no longer\nany need to offer anything to Indol.
3	Slowly but surely, Genbu was returning\nto its former vitality. We were hoping\nthat our problems were over...
4	We have been far too lenient on Indol,\nit seems.
5	And from all this, there is something\nelse I now understand.
6	That it is you who have the power to\ndetermine the future of Alrest...
tlk00120108_ms.json
1	Disaster is raining upon Alrest from\nthe skies...
2	Fortunately, Tantal has been spared\nfrom the assault, but what is Malos\nthinking? Is he trying to destroy us all?
3	We have not the power to ward off, let\nalone stop, the Artifices from wreaking\nchaos.
4	You are the only ones who can end this.\nThe future of Alrest lies with you...
tlk00160106_ms.json
1	Ooo...ooohhhh...
tlk00160109_ms.json
1	Thanks to friends, Lila is in\nperfect working order again!
2	Must offer great apologies for\ntrouble caused by Lila.
3	Things that happened in Mor Ardain\nall quite unfortunate.
4	Lila not know how to apologize enough.
5	From now on Lila work hard to serve\nMasterpon as artificial Blade!
tlk00160110_ms.json
1	Please friends work hard for\nsake of Lila also.
2	In return, Lila take good care of\nMasterpon and this house.
3	Even if Alrest fall to pieces around it,\nLila protect this home to last breath.
tlk00180102_ms.json
1	Lila...
tlk00180103_ms.json
1	Tatazo caused great pain to Lila...
2	If Tatazo not so weak, Lila never\nhave to go through all this...\nTatazo full of regret.
3	So sorry for everything, Lila...
tlk00180104_ms.json
1	Worry not, friends! Tatazo will fix\nLila without fail! No matter how much\nwork and money it take!
2	With Lila like this, Tatazo never able\nto face late Dadapon Soosoo!
3	Lila! Hang in there for while longer!\nTatazo will fix Lila soon!
4	Dadapon!
5	Tora!
6	Dadapon borrowing house of Tora.\nHope that OK. Need use of facilities\nfor repairs of Lila!
7	If is for Lila, use house of Tora\nas much as Dadapon want!
8	Much thanks.
9	It probably take quite long while\nbefore Lila able to function again,\nbut Dadapon fix her without fail!
10	Work hard, Dadapon!\nTora know you can do it!
11	Tora work hard too, OK? Try not to\ncause too much trouble for friends!
tlk00180105_ms.json
1	Now that Lila all good and fixed,\nTatazo pondering what to do next.
2	Should maybe improve Lila more?\nOr work on power up for Poppi?
3	Too many enticing options!
tlk00180106_ms.json
1	How is Quantum Technochampion\nmode serving friends?
2	When Tatazo first see that mode,\nTatazo realize... "Ah, finally Dadapon\nis surpassed by own sonnypon."
3	Tora grow more than Dadapon ever\nrealize. Now true great inventor.
4	But no-no-no! Tatazo can not allow\nTora to get ahead so easy!
5	Someday Tatazo outdo Tora again...\nWill create new miniature mode,\nsmaller than smallest ant!
tlk00180107_ms.json
1	Friends leave this town to\nTatazo and Lila!
2	Tatazo gave Lila sneaky upgrade while\nfriends not looking. Now she have\nhundred thousand horsepower!
3	So no matter what disaster come here,\nTatazo and Lila will protect home.
4	Tora and friends can feel safe in\nthat knowledge, and focus all effort\non important mission!
tlk00190102_ms.json
1	Going to the usual spot, I take it?
2	You know, the one on the other side of\nthe village, with the stunning view.
3	You go and do your thing, then.\nI'll have a nice, hearty meal waiting\nfor you when you get back!
tlk00190103_ms.json
1	Oh, I almost forgot.
2	Pyra asked me to teach her how to\nmake the village specialty, for when\nyou're on the road.
3	Here. I've written down the exact\namounts so she can cook up a quick\nmeal whenever you need.
tlk00190104_ms.json
1	Kirk, Kazuna, and Mark'll be off to\nschool in Indol starting next year...
2	I do wonder how they'll get on. It's the\nbullying I'm worried about, mostly.
3	I know, I know. They won't be gone for\na while yet. Still...
4	I think of those boys as my own flesh\nand blood. I can't help but worry.
5	Rex! You're back sooner than\nI expected.
6	Forget something, did you?
7	Oh, no, actually, I just...
8	Now don't you keep those ladies\nwaiting!
9	Grab your things and off you go!\nQuick-quick! Get a move on!
10	Fine, I... Fine!
tlk00190105_ms.json
1	You're back from Indol, aren't you?
2	What was it like there? I hope they\ntreat children well, if nothing else!
3	The boys're dead set on going to the\nAcademy, but we don't know what to\nexpect, so it worries me a little...
4	I just hope they manage to fit in with\nthe other kids, really.
tlk00190106_ms.json
1	Thank you for watching over my Rex.\nAs his guardian, it makes me happy to\nsee him with such dependable friends.
2	He's great at charging straight forward\ntowards his goal, but someone needs to\nmake sure he stays on the right path.
3	With you all there to guide him,\nI feel safe knowing he'll do all right.
4	Oh, it's just something about the look\non his face. I think he must have grown\na lot in a short space of time.
5	I can tell, you know. I was the one who\nraised him all these years.
6	Promise me you'll take good care\nof my boy, all right?
7	Thanks for taking the time out of your\nbusy schedule to pay us all a visit.
8	I'm sure the kids would be delighted\nif you said hello.
9	They're always asking for you,\nwondering when you'll show up.
10	Aww. Yeah, I should do that.
11	And Rex?
12	Yeah?
13	I just want you to know that I'm\nalways here for you.
14	Just remember that when the going\ngets tough. I'll set you straight, do\nyou hear?
15	Yeah. Thanks, Auntie Corinne.
tlk00190109_ms.json
1	I heard Indol's no more. What in the\nworld is happening to Alrest?
2	I'm sure you've things you need to\ndo, and this goes without saying, but\njust...be careful, will you?
3	And when this is all over...well, I know\nthis isn't the most happening of places,\nbut I hope you'll come back to visit us.
4	Rex.
5	Take care out there.\nWe'll be waiting for you.
6	I will. And of course I'll come back.
7	Well then, you can look forward to\na big plate of Acqua Pearl Pazza\nwhen you come home!
8	Don't you dare let your Auntie Corinne\ndown now!
tlk00190110_ms.json
1	Well, hello! I heard you helped build\nus a school!
2	Oh, that's wonderful news. Our Mark's\nbeen so down about not being able to\ngo to his Academy...
3	We're all so proud, you know.\nI even heard the mayor bragging\nabout "Rex, the pride of our village"!
4	Seeing my little boy all grown up,\nand with such wonderful friends...\nWhat more could a parent ask for?
tlk002003_ms.json
1	テキスト
tlk00230101_ms.json
1	Oh, don't you worry about me.\nI'm fine.
2	Iona's helping me look for\nthe thing I want to give you,\nbut no luck yet.
3	I know it's a pain, but would you mind\ncoming back tomorrow? I bet it'll have\nturned up by then.
tlk00230102_ms.json
1	*cough cough hack*\nQu-quickly! *cough*
2	Never mind me! It's Iona...\nHelp Iona... *cough cough*
tlk00230103_ms.json
1	Never let down your guard. Mercs\nare always treading a thin line.
2	Vandham was always ready to give\nup his life for the cause. Same goes\nfor his followers, and me.
3	But Iona... She's shaken up something\nbad. One minute he's there and the\nnext he's not...
4	That's a wound that's gonna take\na long time to heal...
tlk00230104_ms.json
1	Iona's calmed down a little now.\nTrooper's been putting on a brave\nface, even showed us a smile.
2	I started getting ready to chronicle\nVandham's exploits, but I'm not\nmaking any real headway.
3	Soon as I start asking round, we just\nstart reminiscing about days gone by...
4	Just goes to show ya how much he\ntouched our hearts, eh?
tlk00230105_ms.json
1	Heya, folks! Glad you dropped by!\n*cough cough*
2	Whew... It's harder getting up these\ndays, lemme tell ya.
3	I'm starting to wonder whether I'll\nreally be able to finish writing before\nmy time's up...
tlk00230106_ms.json
1	You guys've given me the strength to\ngo on living a while longer. So, cheers\nfor that!
2	Iona's started helping me out with the\nwriting recently.
3	We think up the best way to present\nperformances together too.
4	Too right. She's a gem, ain't she?
tlk00240102_ms.json
1	If you're looking for Grandpa,\nhe's in the last room at the end\nof the corridor.
2	You should go say hi to him, Mister\nVandham. I think he'd like that.
tlk00240103_ms.json
1	I'll sort things out with Grandpa.\nYou just head to the inn.
2	It's in the shopping district, past the\ntheater, all the way down the stairs.
tlk00240105_ms.json
1	...Ah!\nSorry, I was really getting into this\nbook...
2	It's just...I can't stop thinking about\nMister Vandham...
3	Grandpa said I should try reading\na book to take my mind off things,\nand that's all I've been doing lately.
tlk00240106_ms.json
1	Grandpa's taking a lot more naps\nthese days.
2	He's barely made any progress on\nMister Vandham's story...
tlk00240107_ms.json
1	Grandpa's a lot livelier than he was\nbefore!
2	He's been going backstage a lot more\nnow too...
3	And Mister Vandham's story's coming\nalong nicely!
4	I'm looking forward to seeing it on\nstage. You should come and see it too!
tlk002702_ms.json
1	...*sigh*
2	...Oh! I didn't see you there.
3	Listen...would you entertain me for\na moment?
4	Thank you.
5	Well, I'd tried so hard to make it all\nwork out...but it all ended in failure.
6	Don't get me wrong, the Love Potion\nitself was a roaring success. And my\nbeloved drank it, just as I'd planned.
7	But that's when everything went pear-\nshaped. The problem was the timing.
8	Right at that moment, my beloved\nbumped into a woman who just\nhappened to be passing by...
9	And just like that, he swept her off her\nfeet with a passion like you wouldn't\nbelieve and ran off into the distance...
10	My Love Potion is incredibly potent,\nso I don't suppose he'll ever look my\nway again now...
11	That potion was my life's work...\nI wonder, what was the point of it all?
12	Oh, you're worried about me?\nWell that's very sweet of you.
13	...Let me think.
14	I once told you I would create a\nconcoction that would help people\nacross the world.
15	Back then, I was only saying that to\nmanipulate you, but perhaps I can\nmake that a reality now...
16	...Hah hah hah...
17	Thank you for letting me burden you\nwith my woes. I'm feeling a whole lot\nbetter now.
18	From now on, I shall strive to create\nan elixir that will truly bring happiness\nto the world!
19	Just try not to be so trusting in future.\nYou don't want to be taken in again by\nthe likes of me!
tlk00340102_ms.json
1	Never imagined that the Aegis's troupe\nwould be a buncha kids...
2	Don't take it the wrong way. I'm just\nsurprised. You musta had it real tough.
3	Our boss is really concerned about\nyou lot. Don't you worry, there ain't a\nperson here who thinks badly of you.
4	You can rest easy here in Garfont.\nTake some time to recuperate.
tlk00340103_ms.json
1	Us Mercs, we respect hard work\nand dedication, so we can't afford\nto skimp on our training.
2	You guys are traveling with the Aegis,\nso it's especially important to keep\nyourselves in good shape.
3	You can't afford to rely on others to\nhelp you out in a pinch. You gotta\nlearn to protect yourselves.
tlk00340104_ms.json
1	Safe journey. Fonsa Myma's a way out.
2	And the monsters are tough as old\nnails out there. Make sure you're all\nset before you head out, yeah?
3	When in doubt, just bear the Boss's\nwords in mind. He'll keep you in good\nstead.
tlk00340105_ms.json
1	I knew Boss had an aversion to desk\nwork, but I didn't think it was quite\nthis bad...
2	Boss left us with so much paperwork,\nwe're kinda swamped right now.
3	Is that why he was always so keen to\nget out of here? Because he didn't\nwant to deal with it?
tlk00340106_ms.json
1	Hey, Boss! Are you taking on missions\nfor the Merc Group?
2	The more missions you complete, the\nmore you'll be trusted with the bigger\nones!
3	Just remember to drop by from time\nto time, yeah?
tlk00340107_ms.json
1	The canned food we've gathered will\nlast us a while, and it's healthy stuff.\nGood thing they're tasty as!
2	The more missions you complete, the\nmore you'll be trusted with the bigger\nones.
3	Just remember to drop by from time\nto time, yeah?
tlk00340108_ms.json
1	Glad to see that the mercs finally\nacknowledge you as boss. The lot\nof us are raring to go now!
2	The more missions you complete, the\nmore you'll be trusted with the bigger\nones.
3	Just remember to drop by from time\nto time, yeah?
tlk00340109_ms.json
1	Hiya! That new member we recruited's\ndoing a fine job!
2	Alicia gets the work done no problem,\nbut it's her personality that really\nshines. She's the life of the party!
3	Popoh gets the work done no problem,\nbut it's her skills as a therapist that\nreally put her above the rest.
4	Zengrid really has a great handle on\nour finances. He makes sure nothing\nbut nothing goes to waste!
5	It's a promising start for a new\nemployee! We expect great things!
6	Just remember to drop by from time\nto time, yeah?
tlk00340110_ms.json
1	We're now the number one merc group!\nThere ain't a person in town who ain't\nheard the name of the Garfont Mercs!
2	And you know what? We couldn't've\ndone it without you, kid! If he were here\ntoday, Vandham would be proud!
tlk00350102_ms.json
1	Hey. You doing all right?
2	Me, I still can't believe the\nold guy's copped it...
3	But that's enough moping from me.\nThat's no way to behave in front of our\nnew Boss now, is it?
tlk00350103_ms.json
1	Hey. Heading out to the\nGreat Blowhole, right?
2	Well, Garfont ain't much of a tourist\ndestination, but it's got a decent\nlineup of supplies.
3	Be sure you get yourselves all kitted\nout before you head off, yeah?
4	If the going gets tough, maybe catch\na few winks at the inn and then have\nanother crack at it.
5	Sometimes a quick nap's all you need\nto feel like you can take on the world!
tlk00350104_ms.json
1	You're heading out to Fonsa Myma\nwith the boss? Wish I could join you...
2	Fonsa Myma's a melting pot of culture.\nI'd love to join you, catch a few plays...
3	What? You didn't picture me as the\ntheatergoing type?
4	Anyhow, just make sure you're well\nequipped for the journey. Wouldn't\nwant you to give the boss any trouble.
tlk00350105_ms.json
1	Now that I'm acting as mentor, I ain't\nso sure exactly how I'm supposed to\nbe doing the mentoring...
2	I just feel like Boss had a better\nhandle on the way it's all done...
3	I know I'm going about it the wrong\nway somehow.
4	*sigh* Let's hope he comes back soon\nbefore I mess this all up...
tlk00350106_ms.json
1	You know, Urayan food may not look\nappetizing, but it's actually damn tasty.
2	And there's nothing better than a swig\nof Jenerossi Tea after a good meal.
3	What? You think elegantly sipping\ntea doesn't suit me?
4	I'm a bit like Urayan food myself.\nI may not look it, but I'm pretty refined\nwhen you get to know me!
tlk00350107_ms.json
1	I dipped a finger in some of our\nemergency rations and strike me,\nwas it tasty!
2	Makes me kinda looking forward to\nMerc Missions now, getting some tasty\ngrub like that!
tlk00350108_ms.json
1	Now that was a real battle!\nHaven't fought like that for yonks!
2	I've clearly lost my edge with all the\noffice work I've been busy with.
3	I'm gonna make time to train between\nshifts, so let's have a bit of rough an'\ntumble some time, yeah?
tlk00350109_ms.json
1	Glad you and Yew managed to find\na decent person for the job!
2	I can tell you put a lot of thought into\npicking that particular candidate!
tlk00350110_ms.json
1	Work's keeping us busy these days.\nWe've got to assign missions, work out\nhow to split the earnings, all that stuff.
2	I really wish Vandham could've been\nhere to see all this, y'know?
3	Nah, I'm sure he is. Watching.\nSomewhere up there... Welp, better\nmake sure I don't slack off then!
tlk00400102_ms.json
1	Why...\nI had only the best interests of the\nstate at heart...
2	Was what I was doing so wrong?
3	What was I supposed to have done to\ndefend my country? Our Titan does\nnot have many years left on the clock...
4	...Never mind. It's not as if dwelling on\nit now is going to do us any good.
5	When I return to Mor Ardain, I wonder\nwhat is to become of my place within\nthe Senate...
tlk00410104_ms.json
1	A war in Temperantia, the demilitarized\nzone between Mor Ardain and Uraya,\nmust be avoided at all costs...
2	But it is likely that that was Mor\nArdain's goal all along.
3	The Praetor has entrusted you to\ndefuse the situation, but should\nworst come to worst...
4	We will have to take precautionary\nmeasures.
tlk00410108_ms.json
1	You are bound for Tantal, I believe?
2	I trust that you will fulfill your duty\nas the Praetor's envoy.
3	Remember, His Eminence has placed\nall his hope in you...
tlk00600101_ms.json
1	Welcome! Please to make note Melolo\nshrewd saleswoman. Not offer special\nrate just because friends with Rex!
2	Rex! It good to see you!\nYou always welcome!
3	Demand for salvaged parts seeming\nto change with time. Maybe best to\ncheck back regularly!
4	Rex always passionate about work.\nMelolo like that about you. Wish lazy\nson would follow example...
5	It been while since last saw you, Rex.\nTiwitiwi been turning up lots recently.
6	It show you how people capable of\ngrowing as individuals. Unlike lazy\nson. He not grow at all.
7	Alrest is in time of crisis, but Melolo\nsurprised to find that lazy son not\neven venture foot outside door!
8	When world finally peaceful again,\nwould ask Rex to teach son example\nof role model!
tlk00600102_ms.json
1	It not matter how much you visit,\nRex. Melolo still not giving you any\nspecial treatment!
2	Rex should go spend little sum of\n200G on tasty treat like Samod.\nThat sure to cheer you up!
tlk00610101_ms.json
1	Let's face it, no one's going to\nsave us. We have to stand up\nand fight for ourselves...
2	Never mind. Just leave me alone.\nI'm busy.
tlk00610104_ms.json
1	I'm spending the whole day\nhelping out at the docks as\npart of my salvager training.
2	You have to run back and forth all over\nthe place. It's pretty exhausting...
3	Isn't salvaging all about diving, though?\nI'm not really seeing the point of this...
tlk00610105_ms.json
1	There's a lot of nice people here in\nArgentum.
2	I've been helping out at the docks for\na while, but Garram only recently told\nme why we have to do work like this.
3	It's so that we can get familiar with\nArgentum, and build up our stamina\nand endurance.
4	I think I can work hard knowing that\nit's for good people. I need to return\nthe kindness they showed me.
tlk00610106_ms.json
1	Hey, guess what! Garram's going to\nstart giving me salvager training!
2	But Pittman's supposed to be there\ntoo...
3	Ever since the time I stole that guy's\nboat, he's been super suspicious of us.
4	I guess I've only got myself to blame,\nbut it's made things really awkward\nbetween us...
tlk00610107_ms.json
1	I never thought salvager training would\nbe so tough...
2	It's actually pretty scary... I feel like\nI'm going to dread the diving part.
3	Yeah...I'll be fine!
4	It's not like we have anywhere else to\ngo, and we promised to repay the\nkindness everyone's shown us.
5	I'm still new to this, but I'll stick at it.\nI'll be a first rate salvager someday,\njust wait and see!
tlk00610108_ms.json
1	Oh, hi! Perfect timing.\nI want to give you something!
2	Look, our very first actual find as\nsalvagers! I want you to have it!
3	No idea what it is, but I bet you'll\nfind a use for it somehow!
4	We all decided together that we'd make\nthe first thing we salvaged ourselves\na present to you guys!
5	If it weren't for you, we'd never have\ngot these salvager jobs, after all.
6	We'll work hard to repay our debts,\nyou can count on that!
tlk00610109_ms.json
1	I've been helping out with salvaging\nlately.
2	My skills aren't really up to scratch\nyet, but I'm actually doing it. I'm\nactually diving into the Cloud Sea!
3	If I can keep this up, it won't be long\nbefore we achieve our goal...
4	Oh, nothing! Just pretend you didn't\nhear that!
tlk00620105_ms.json
1	Why...\nI had only the best interests of the\nstate at heart...
2	Was what I was doing so wrong?
3	What was I supposed to have done to\ndefend my country? Our Titan does\nnot have many years left on the clock...
4	...Never mind. It's not as if dwelling on\nit now is going to do us any good.
5	Stop that Titan Weapon, I implore you!\nElse I fear Mor Ardain is done for...
tlk00630104_ms.json
1	To get to the Omega Fetter, you'll need\nto leave town, head through Amphoret\nPillar and descend the Genbu Drifts.
2	Once you're out of the drifts, you'll\nalso need to traverse the Great Pillar\nPassage.
3	I realize that we are in no position to\nask anything of you. And yet...
tlk00630106_ms.json
1	The children of Tantal are raised\nnot with lullabies, but with the epics\nof Addam.
2	So we were painfully aware of the\nthreat that the Aegis poses us.
3	We feared that her return may wreak\ndevastation upon our world.
4	But we realize now that we\nmisunderstood.
5	Her rightful place is with you. You\nmust wrest her from Torna's grasp\nby any means necessary.
tlk00630107_ms.json
1	The king always believed in the Driver\nof the Aegis, and in Your Highness.
2	Believed that you would bring the\nAegis back no matter the cost.
3	I see that his belief was well-placed.\nBut more than anything, I am glad to\nsee you safe.
tlk00630108_ms.json
1	Indol have violated a taboo...\nManipulating another Titan is a nigh\nunforgivable act.
2	I urge you to take great caution on\nyour journey to Indol.
3	Alrest has celebrated peace for\n500 years, but it seems that is now\nat an end...
4	There's no telling what could happen\nat this stage, so please, stay vigilant.
tlk00630109_ms.json
1	Tantal has come out of the attack\nrelatively unscathed, perhaps due to\nour proximity with the World Tree.
2	But I witnessed many Titans falling\ninto the Cloud Sea from afar...
3	It seems Alrest's final hour is at hand...
4	It pains me that Tantal's decision\n500 years ago would cause such\nrepercussions...
tlk00640101_ms.json
1	Did you find Pittman's ship?
2	Eh? In Torigoth?
3	I guess that's logical. Gormott's the\nclosest Titan right now.
4	Well, hurry up and find that thief!\nAnd make sure you bring my ship\nback when you're done!
5	Pittman's getting teary eyed,\nthe poor bloke...
tlk00640102_ms.json
1	We've got Rhys and his pals helping\nout at the docks to put some muscle\non them.
2	Lifting crates, checking cargo, mooring\nTitans... That kind of thing.
3	Being a salvager's all about stamina\nand focus, so this is pretty much the\nperfect training for them.
4	Now to find out how long they can\nkeep this up for...
tlk00640103_ms.json
1	Hey. Rhys and his gang are starting to\nreally get the hang of working here.\nThey're getting on with the locals too.
2	Having hard workers like them on\nboard saves us a lot of work too, so\nit goes both ways.
3	Although Pittman hasn't quite found\nin his heart to forgive them yet, seeing\nit was his ship that got stolen...
4	Well, give it time. I'm sure he'll come\nround eventually.
tlk00640104_ms.json
1	Turns out Rhys and his pals are good,\nhard workers.
2	Pittman's been going through the\nsalvaging basics with them lately.
3	They've got the guts and they've got\nthe spirit. They might even turn out to\nbe like you someday, Rex.
tlk00640107_ms.json
1	Hey. Rhys and his gang are really\ncoming along - they can go salvaging\nwithout supervision now and all!
2	We'd never have discovered raw\ntalent like theirs if you hadn't got us\nto hire them.
3	You've got a real eye for people, Rex.
4	In any case, we've got us a promising\nbunch of up-and-coming salvagers for\nyour trouble, and for that, I'm grateful.
tlk00650101_ms.json
1	Please, get me back my ship!\nI'm still paying off the mortgage!
2	And make sure you catch that thieving\nlittle brat! I'll be sure to make the\nguards teach him a thing or two!
3	Please!
tlk00650102_ms.json
1	I still can't say I really trust those brats.
2	They look like they're working hard,\nbut you never know when they might\nup and off with something again...
3	I don't care how tragic it is that they\nlost their homes. You can't just resort\nto stealing!
4	No, there's no telling what they might\ndo. I've still got my eye on them...
tlk00650104_ms.json
1	Rhys and the others are undergoing\nserious training right now.
2	Watching them give it all they have's\ngot me all fired up.
3	Don't get me wrong, it's not that I like\nseeing them suffer.
4	Seeing them overcome their difficulties,\nimproving their salvager skills... That's\nthe kind of thing that really inspires me.
5	I want to keep pushing them, and see\nhow far they can go.
tlk00650107_ms.json
1	I think Rhys and his pals will turn out\nto be fine salvagers, just like you, Rex.
2	Trust me, I've seen a lot of salvagers in\nmy time, and these guys have potential.
3	I've only been letting them use normal\ncylinders, and they still managed to\nhaul in some Titan Quartz.
4	That right there shows they've got the\nsalvager sense.
5	They are always a bit worse for wear,\nthough, thanks to all the angry Krabble\nand Lysaat they drag along with them.
tlk00670102_ms.json
1	Yeee-owch...\nThat's gonna leave a bruise...
2	The worst part about being head of\nsecurity is having to report to my boss.\nHe's such a jerk.
3	In fact, you'd better not distract me\nor I'll get an earful again.
4	We've got to keep on the lookout for\nthis Blade with a green Core Crystal...
tlk00670104_ms.json
1	I got demoted for letting Torna get\naway.
2	And now? Now I'm back to the old\ngarrison patrol.
3	But I've got to say, it's a fair sight\nbetter than being bossed around\nby a lousy boss...
4	My salary took a hefty blow, but really\nthis suits me just fine. I can get by.
5	Wh-what's Special Inquisitor Mòrag\ndoing here in Torigoth...?!
6	O-oh, forgive me! Please, forget\nI said anything!
7	I, Padraig, will humbly carry out my\nduty as is expected of my station!
tlk00670105_ms.json
1	There was a whopping huge explosion\nover towards the World Tree. You got\nout of there all right, I hope?
2	Not once have I ever thought I was\nlucky to be serving here in Torigoth.
3	I know my home's in an unprecedented\nsituation, but what good's one measly\nsoldier going to do?
4	At the very least, I have to try and help\nout the refugees who fled here...
5	...Wait, Special Inquisitor Mòrag?!\nI'd never have thought...
6	Don't tell me...must be to check\non the wellbeing of the troops?!\nOhh, there is no greater honor!
7	Ah, if only you were my immediate\nsuperior, it would be so much easier\nto motivate myself to keep working...
8	...Please, forget anything I just said!
tlk01000802_ms.json
1	Welcome back, bro!
2	I'm helping Corinne around the house!\nSee? I'm no lazybones!
3	Good man! Promise you'll keep that\nup, for my sake!
4	Yeah, I will! You keep at the salvaging\ntoo, bro!
5	Hiya, Rex's friends!
6	I wanna hear all about your\nadventures!
tlk01000803_ms.json
1	I heard Mark's school's gone now...
2	I was hoping to study there meself...
3	Do you know of any other good\nschools?
tlk01000804_ms.json
1	Oh gosh... The girl I dreamed up is\nso insanely pretty...
2	I just wish she was really real. Maybe\nif I go out adventuring like you guys,\nI'll meet someone like her someday...
3	What's that supposed to mean?\nThis is my homework! I'm studying!
4	My teacher said we could use anyone\nwe know personally as a reference...
5	But I don't have a mum or dad...\nSo I guess it'll have to be\nAuntie Corinne then.
6	Having a Nopon teacher's really cute.
7	Mr. Kulakula comes sometimes, but no\nNopon actually live here, so this is the\nfirst chance I've had to get a good look.
8	Mr. Lapupu loves cute things!
9	Huh...? Classes? O-of course I'm paying\nattention to them!
tlk01000805_ms.json
1	Everyone's saying that Miss Smaia\ncan make you better no matter how\nill you are! Isn't that amazing?
2	I wonder if I can become a doctor\nif I study hard enough...
3	Miss Quiqui's kind of adorable.
4	One of her experiments blew up in\nher face and now her fur's all singed.\nI hope she's OK...
5	Huh...? Classes? O-of course I'm paying\nattention to them!
tlk01000806_ms.json
1	Things like the Village Guardian\nare great historical-majigs!
2	And we need to take good care of\ngreat historical-majigs!
3	Uhm...I kind of did play around on top\nof the Village Guardian, though...\nJust don't tell anyone!
4	I've been kind of scared of salvaging\never since that monster showed up\nin the middle of your lesson...
5	But Mr. Tortor says I have potential,\nso I'm still working on my diving!
6	He said if I show him a good dive,\nhe'll teach me to talk like a Nopon!\n"Meheheh"...
tlk01000902_ms.json
1	Welcome back, big bro!
2	Auntie Corinne's over the moon that\nyou brought back your bride-to-be!
3	She's so pretty... Ahh, I'm so jelly!
4	What are you...hold on, she's not my\nbride-to-be! You've got the wrong\nend of the stick, Kazuna!
5	Mark's so diligent. It's no surprise he\nmade it into the Academy.
6	Kind of sad that Kirk and me won't\nbe able to play with him any more,\nthough.
7	I'm sitting right across from him now\nso we can hang out for as long as we\ncan. And I can peek at his notes!
tlk01000903_ms.json
1	Did Indol Academy really get\ndestroyed?
2	I was kind of wanting to have a crack\nat it myself, seeing Mark studying so\nhard...
3	What? I'm serious! I even borrowed\nsome of his books!
tlk01000904_ms.json
1	Epitome of beauty, huh? Mmm...\nI guess a prince or something's got\nto be really handsome...
2	I don't suppose you happen to\nknow any princes, do you?
3	Ah! Scratch that! I need to be thinking\nabout this from a literary perspective!
4	Thus marched in an affluent prince...\nriding an Eks as swift as the wind...\nWhew, this is hard...
5	Cloud Sea waves, a fluffy tumble /\nThunderbolts, they crash and rumble /\nAuntie Corinne...will nag and grumble /
6	Forget that last part! She'll have\na go at me for that one!
7	Bark, bark...\nSniffle-snuffle...\nYip! Yip Yip! Lazy Sway!
8	How do you capture a Kapiba's\nfeelings? This is hard...
tlk01000905_ms.json
1	So this school wasn't always a school?\nI never knew!
2	You got all the materials for us and\nMason helped rebuild the building...
3	You even got us some teachers!\nIt's not a proper school without\nteachers, after all.
4	Miss Quiqui always launches straight\ninto experiments, and none of them\never go well. It's a bit worrying...
5	But I love having a Nopon teacher.\nThey're just soooo cute!
6	And the way they talk, it's so dear\nI just can't bear it!
tlk01000906_ms.json
1	History lessons make my head spin...
2	Mr. Alisdeigh wants us to go to\nSpirit Crucible Elpys. That's exciting\nfor a school trip, don'tcha think?
3	Erp, I shouldn't be talking in the\nmiddle of class. I'll get told off!
4	We get to salvage during lessons!\nJust the other day, I reeled in a\nFairy-Tale Belt Pulley!
5	Everything looks like treasure to us,\nbut I guess it's not all that rare, is it?
tlk01001002_ms.json
1	I'm gonna start studying to be the\nIndoline Academy's star pupil!
2	I'd never have got in if it weren't\nfor your donation money, Rex.\nI owe it to you.
3	And I reckon getting good marks is\nthe only way I can really repay you.
4	Ahh, I wonder what it'll be like?\nI can hardly wait!
5	I'm gonna start studying to be the\nIndoline Academy's star pupil!
6	I'd never have got in if it weren't\nfor Rex donating me that money.
7	The only way I can make good on a\ndebt like that is by studying as hard as I\ncan getting the best marks!
8	Ahh, I wonder what it'll be like?\nI can hardly wait!
tlk01001003_ms.json
1	Now Indol's gone, I can't go to the\nacademy any more...
2	I studied so hard to prepare for the\nexam, and all the fees were paid\nfor, too...
3	I really wish I could've studied there...
tlk01001004_ms.json
1	True beauty... Hmm... Hmmmm...
2	Miss Mesulia's lessons are hard...
3	She writes her own books, and they\nsell loads of copies! I guess I'll try\nstudying a little harder...
4	The islands, adrift / flocculent /\nman and his ambitions /\nyielding to the surf...
5	They didn't have this kind of stuff\nin the exam. I'm really liking it!
6	Mr. Lapupu's classes are the funniest!
7	I never thought about what I'd do\nif I became an old man!
8	We're trying to raise a rescued Kapiba\nlike a child. I sort of see why parents\nworry so much about their kids now...
9	Corinne was such a spoilsport\nsometimes, but I should probably\nbe more grateful to her, huh...
tlk01001005_ms.json
1	Since I started Miss Smaia's classes,\nI've started thinking about how\neverything's all made.
2	The doctors in Mor Ardain are pretty\nincredible!
3	I like science experiments, but\nI'm really not sure it's possible to\ntransmute something into gold...
4	Hey, Miss Quiqui! This is supposed to\nbe a lesson, right? Please, at least\nteach us something!
tlk01001006_ms.json
1	Wow... This is really interesting...
2	Shhh! Don't talk to me!\nMr. Alisdeigh is really strict!
3	I really enjoy his history lessons,\nthough. I'm always learning\nsomething new!
4	Mr. Tortor has a really hands-on\napproach to lessons. I like them!
5	Sometimes we get to learn all\nabout salvager stuff and suddenly\nthe lesson's over!
tlk10030101_ms.json
1	Hey! How you doing?
2	Did you think I was dead?\nEven I thought I was dead.
3	Patroka told me not to die. She said\nshe wanted to be the one to kill me.
4	I couldn't just let myself die after an\norder like that. Honestly, I'd be scared\nof the consequences.
5	Well, you'll have to let me come along\nto take a look at the answer that you\nfound.
6	Can I? I can? Yeah!
tlk19000201_ms.json
1	Rex, my boy.\nFeel free to take your time.
2	I'm plenty tired, so I'll just snooze here\nfor a spell.
3	Thanks, Gramps.\nTake it easy, then!
4	And just in case you were wondering...\nI don't need any souvenirs, so don't go\nout of your way for my benefit.
5	Sounds good!
6	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]That definitely means he\nwants something. But what...?
tlk19000202_ms.json
1	I really don't think it's a good idea, Rex.\nJust refuse... Sounds suspicious to me...
2	But it's Chairman Bana's Guild, which is\nlegit, and I already got the advance...\nI'm sure it'll be fine!
3	High compensation usually implies\na high level of risk, you know...
4	I strongly suggest you reconsider\nwhether the job is appropriate for you...
5	Look, it'll be working alongside Drivers!\nIt might be a once-in-a-lifetime thing!\nIsn't that a valuable experience?
6	You always tell me experience is\ninvaluable, right? Well, don't you,\nGramps?
7	Mmmh...
tlk2001015101_ms.json
1	My lord is like family to me.\nHe is kind, caring; an all-round\nwonderful person.
2	There's just one problem...\nHe's still green when it comes to battle\nand fears the sight of blood.
3	Kindness can be seen as weakness.\nThat's why I endeavor to support my\nlord in whatever capacity I can.
tlk2001015102_ms.json
1	I hadn't the power to keep my lord\nout of harm's way...
2	I must become stronger, for his sake.
3	I hope one day to master a skill that\nwould help with exploration. Scaling\nsheer cliff faces, for instance...
tlk4110012101_ms.json
1	Hey, hey, guess what?
2	You know how monsters drop gold\nwhen you beat them?
3	That's 'cos they really, really like\ncollecting shiny things! Bet you\ndidn't know that!
4	Eh, knowing random stuff like that\nisn't going to help me get better\nat swimming.
5	I keep trying and trying, but I'm still\nrubbish at it. Funny, huh?\nA Gormotti kid who can't swim...
tlk4110012102_ms.json
1	Oh, heya!
2	I got to make loads of friends 'cos\nof you, so uh, thanks!
3	And yeah, they're all really nice!
4	They're gunna supervise me an' help \nme get gooder at swimming!
5	They're even gunna help me study!\nHow cool is that?!
tlk4110012103_ms.json
1	One of my friends gave me an\nawesome tip the other day.
2	So, you know how there's a type of\nrock shaped all funny like? Called\nDilemma Rock?
3	Yeah, my friend said you can pick 'em\nup by the dozen in rocky places like\nDawnview Grotto and Twin Trunks Hill.
4	Bet you didn't know that!
tlk4110012104_ms.json
1	Hunting for Salvage Points is all\nthe rage with my friends right now.
2	I've been joining in too, and I found\nthe bestest place ever!
3	It's on the Ardainian Titan battleship's\nleft wing!
4	I totally saw it from Grodd\nResidential Zone!
5	We'd get told off if we went there\nourselves, though. You've gotta\ngo there and tell us about it!
tlk4110012105_ms.json
1	So Indol's kinda disappeared, huh?\nAll the people who came over are\nall spaced out and stuff...
2	I kinda understand, though. I mean,\nthey lost their homes, right?
3	And like, their faith got betrayed.\nPeople are saying that's even worse.
4	But I'm trying to cheer up the kids\nwho took shelter here. We're all\ngoing swimming together and stuff!
5	We can all make friends from\nswimming and then no one'll\nhave to be sad any more!
tlk4110012201_ms.json
1	My big bro became a Driver and\nwent off to Mor Ardain!
2	He said he's gonna earn bucketloads\nof cash!
3	If only Da had stayed here with us...

tlk4110012202_ms.json
1	Oh, you're the ones who helped\nout my big bro! Hey, guess what?\nOur da actually came back!

tlk4110012203_ms.json
1	Oh, you're the ones who helped\nout my big bro! Hey, guess what?\nHe sent us a present!

2	でも最近の兄ちゃんは様子がおかしいんだ\n雰囲気が変わったっていうのか？

4	なあ　一体兄ちゃんになにがあったんだ？
tlk4110012205_ms.json
1	オレは決めたんだ！　スペルビアが沈もうと\n最後まで兄ちゃんと一緒にいるって！

tlk4110012301_ms.json
1	So you guys are like, Driver and Blade,\nright? Like, partners in battle and stuff?
2	How well do you actually\nget along, though?
3	Apparently if you feel a really strong\nAffinity with each other during battle,\nit lets you use some amazing attacks!
4	But if you're really not feeling it,\nyour Blade might not even be able\nto support you properly.
5	Me and Siàn, we'd have no problem,\n'cos we get along great! But I guess\nit's not that easy for everyone.
tlk4110012302_ms.json
1	I heard the water tower over at\nKloom Farm got totally wrecked!
2	And even worse, the army let\nthat baddie from Torna they'd\ncaptured get away!
3	How could they be so useless\nwhen the Flamebringer was on\nthe scene and everything?
4	Is she not as strong as everyone says?
5	My ma was getting really worried.\nTelling me to watch myself because\nthose villains might still be nearby.
6	Actually, you guys aren't from around\nhere either, are you? Haha, don't worry,\nI can tell you're not dangerous.
tlk4110012303_ms.json
1	Hmm, d'you know anything\nabout Tantal?
2	Apparently there's some ruins there\nwith a Blade sealed inside.
3	Some kind of scaaaaaary Blade that's\nsupposed to bring disaster!
4	That's what my great-grandpa\nsaid, anyway.
5	I'm totally gonna go there and\nfind that Blade someday!
tlk4110012304_ms.json
1	Hey, have you ever tried\nBeat Paste Paratha?
2	Paratha is a staple food in Gormott,\nbut if you mix in some mashed\nBeat Shrimp, it's extra delicious!
3	It's like, a food revolution!
4	I don't know where this Leftheria\nplace is, but it must be a great place\nif people come up with stuff like this!
5	I want to go there with Siàn someday\nand try some fresh Beat Shrimp\ncooked by the pros!
tlk4110012305_ms.json
1	Have you ever eaten something called\nSnowy Dudleya Gelée?
2	It's so delicious, right?!\nSiàn loves the stuff.
3	I want to go to Tantal with Siàn\nsomeday and see Ghost Dudleya\nplants in their natural environment!
4	I bet Siàn would get so excited.\nShe's always wondering about what\nkind of gorgeous plant it could be.
5	Anyway, this is all thanks to the\nwork you've done encouraging\nbusiness here in Gormott!
6	We'd never have been able to eat such\ndelicious foods if it weren't for all the\ntrade with Tantal lately!
7	So...thanks a bunch!
tlk4110012401_ms.json
1	Looking at plants is so relaxing,\ndon't you think?
2	I thought you might agree.\nHere, let me tell you something.
3	If you see a spot that seems to glitter -\na rock formation, a tuft of grass, a tree\nroot - you should try examining it.
4	Sometimes you can find stray\nitems that have been hidden\naway by monsters.
5	They can actually be quite useful.
6	Other times though, you'll find a buried\ntreasure trove. When that happens,\nyou'll need special skills to unearth it.
7	I hear some Blades are good at\nthat kind of thing.
tlk4110012402_ms.json
1	I don't care what my parents say,\nI'm going to become a botanical\nscientist in Mor Ardain.
2	You know how Gormott has lots of\ntrees everywhere, right? More than any\nother country in the world, actually!
3	So we make all sorts of things out\nof wood. From tools to furniture,\nit has all kinds of uses.
4	But in Mor Ardain, they hardly have\nany trees at all.
5	Apparently if it weren't for the wood\nwe export to them, they might run out\ncompletely.
6	As someone who grew up in Gormott,\nthat makes me really sad. I can't\nimagine living without trees and wood.
7	So I want to study botany in\nMor Ardain, and do something\nabout their tree shortage problem.
8	My dream is to make Mor Ardain the\nsecond most tree-covered country\nin Alrest! After Gormott, of course!

1	Have you visited the weird house just\nbelow here? There's a game called\nTiger! Tiger! just by the entrance.
2	I tried playing it once, just to see\nwhat it was like, but it was scarily\naddictive. I had fun for hours!
3	My high score right now is\n18,310 points!
4	My dream was to become a botanical\nscientist, but maybe I should become a\npro Tiger! Tiger! player instead...
tlk4110012405_ms.json
1	Somebody beat my high score\nin that Tiger! Tiger! game.\nI was so shocked...
2	My beautiful 18,310 points...
3	But once I got over my shock,\nI resolved to practice even harder.
4	I trained from morning to night, never\nstopping to eat, even when I got blisters\nand my fingers started to bleed...
5	Until finally, I achieved a new\nhigh score of 81,107 points!
6	Nobody's EVER going to beat this one.\nI'm the top player in all of Alrest!
tlk4110012406_ms.json
1	You... You're the one who beat my\nhigh score in Tiger! Tiger!, aren't you?
2	I thought nobody would ever be able\nto beat my 81,107 points...
3	You're too good. I admit defeat.\nI guess there's always someone\nstronger out there somewhere.
4	I don't think I'll be able to get a score\nhigher than that again. I think it's time\nI moved on from Tiger! Tiger!, yes.
5	I want you to have this, for being\nsuch a fantastic rival.
6	Good luck with everything!
7	My dream was to go to Mor Ardain and\nbecome a botanical scientist...
8	But I've found a new dream now.
9	I'm going to make a game even more\nexciting than Tiger! Tiger! ever was!
10	And someday, when I finish it,\nI'll challenge you to beat me at it.
11	Next time I won't lose!

1	Hi, and welcome to Neuromin\nTextiles. Torigoth isn't all just\nabout woodcraft!
2	I like you, owner. You appreciate that\nthere's more to Gormotti crafts than\njust that tired old woodwork stuff.
tlk4110012601_ms.json
1	I can't believe Eluned knows a bunch\nof Drivers as amazing as you guys!
2	I'm a bit jealous, 'cos the only Driver\nI know is a lazy old bum...
3	I bet you and your Blade do some\nawesome Blade Combos, am I right?
4	You get an elemental effect along with\nthat, so it should really help you get an\nedge up on your enemies!
5	I really want to see a combo someday.\nDriver and Blade fighting side by side...\nYes, please!
tlk4110012602_ms.json
1	You're kind of a pro Driver, right?\nDo you own any shops too?
2	There's supposed to be a ton of\nbenefits if you sign up for it, like\nshop discounts and stuff.
3	Actually, I'm pretty sure there are no\ndownsides to being an owner!
4	You can get some weird perks from it\ntoo, like faster movement speed or an\nexperience boost...
tlk4110012603_ms.json
1	Ugh! Can't I win one single match?!
2	Stupid Eluned! Why can't he at least\nlet me win once?
3	I guess it's still fun, though, even if I\nend up losing. I'm glad I've got friends\nto play with!
4	But that just sounds like I'm a quitter,\ndoesn't it? Just you wait, Eluned.\nYou're gonna get your comeuppance!
tlk4110012701_ms.json
1	My leg's finally back to normal!\nI can run and jump around with it\nlike nothing ever even happened!
2	I'm trying my best to help out without\ngetting attacked by monsters now.
3	Oh, and I tried building something all\nby myself now, a little bookcase!
4	It's so hard to cut wood straight.\nI don't know how Dad does it!
tlk4110012801_ms.json
1	Mmm, Lunana Smoothies are yummy!
2	I can never drink a whole one, though,\nso I go halfsies on them with Kallum!
3	Hey Kallum, let's play Chooby Tubes\nafter this! I'm so gonna win this time!
tlk4110014101_ms.json
1	I used to live on an island, but it got\ncaught up in a conflict between Uraya\nand Mor Ardain.
2	The grown-ups kept yelling at each\nother about where to go, where the\nbest place for us would be.
3	In the end, they split into two groups,\none for Uraya and one for Mor Ardain,\nand started fighting among themselves.
4	Grown-ups really are the worst...
5	Vandham said they\naren't all the same.
6	But frankly, I find that hard to believe...
tlk4110014102_ms.json
1	There's a fruit in Uraya called a Black\nPomegranate.
2	And each one you eat's got a different\nflavor. Sweet, sour, bitter...
3	When Vandham brought us here,\nhe gave us all Black Pomegranates.
4	Back then, it tasted really bitter and\nI spat it all out. Vandham burst out\nlaughing.
5	And now, just like that, he's gone.\nThis is why you can't trust grown-ups...
tlk4110014103_ms.json
1	I had to leave my island because it\ngot caught up in a conflict between\nUraya and Mor Ardain.
2	Vandham helped us out, but I hear\nsome of the others went to Indol.
3	I wonder which of us is happier now?
4	Although... Indol seems like a better\nplace, all in all.
5	It's a city, and it's well protected by\nPraetor Amalthus, right?
6	I don't trust grown-ups, but the\nPraetor? I think he's different.
tlk4110014104_ms.json
1	Hey, I just had a great idea!
2	A way to stop everyone from fighting,\nso there won't be any more war\norphans like me!
3	It's easy - we just have to not get\ninvolved with the other Titans at all!
4	In Uraya's case, we should just never\nleave the inside of the Titan.
5	If we cut contact from other countries,\nthere won't be any more fighting, right?
6	Wha-?!
7	There's a country that tried that\nalready?!
8	And it didn't work out?!
9	Yeah...I guess a Bunnit-brained idea\nlike that was never going to work...
tlk4110014105_ms.json
1	I... Vandham...\nI'm so glad he was there to help us.
2	If we'd gone to Indol, we probably\nwouldn't be alive now...
3	Amalthus was a two-faced grown-up,\nwasn't he?
4	With Vandham, at least you always\nknew where you stood.
5	I finally understand now. He was one\nof the rare grown-ups you could trust...
6	I'm glad to be here now. I'm so grateful\nto Vandham...and to you too.
tlk4110015101_ms.json
1	Doesn't matter if you fall down\nsomewhere as long as you've got\na Blade with you.
2	Still, I don't fancy seeing something\nscary like that again.
3	I just hope everyone on Indol was\nable to get away OK...
tlk4110015201_ms.json
1	I've got a big brother called Jac,\nand he became a Driver!
2	And guess what? He got into the\nArdainian army!
3	Umm... What weapon did his Blade\nhave again...? Nnnggh...
4	If it was a Greataxe or a Megalance,\nhe could smack the bad guys super\neasily...
5	But it's dangerous too, 'cos if you\ndeal that much damage all at once,\nthey'll get really angry at you.
6	If it was a Bitball, he'd be able to\nheal injured teammates. Bitballs\nare good at doing that.
7	If he's got teammates with a Shield\nHammer or a Chroma Katana, though,\nhe needs to pay attention to their HP!
8	See, I know stuff! That's 'cos\nme and Jac studied together!
tlk4110015202_ms.json
1	I hope my big bro's OK. Really\nhope he's not feeling lonely\nor homesick or anything...
2	It's been like this ever since Da\nwent away.
3	It's kind of sad, but it means I have\nto look after Morca now.
4	I'll follow in my brother's footsteps\nand study to become a Driver!
tlk4110015203_ms.json
1	You helped our big brother out a lot,\ndidn't you? We're so grateful!
2	Thanks so much for helping us!
3	I don't think we'd have been\nreunited if it weren't for you.
4	Oh, it's such a relief that Da\ncame back...
5	We've been playing this game that\nour big bro sent us together and it's\nsuper fun!
6	Ahh, when's Da going to be back?\nI really want us all to play the game\nthat our big bro sent us!
7	I know my brother said my da did\nsome bad things, and that he won't\nbe back for a long time...
8	But even if it takes years, or\neven decades, I still hope it'll\nall work out...
tlk4110017101_ms.json
1	Woo-hoo!\nI'm really raking it in today!
2	The tourists at Milama Viewpoint toss\ntheir coins into the Cloud Sea, but\nsome of them land around here!
3	Tossing a coin's supposed to grant\nyou a wish. Well it sure granted my\nwish...to earn more money, that is!
4	Why don't you have a go too?\nIf you happen to throw it my way,\nI'll save it for a rainy day!
tlk4110017102_ms.json
1	Is the Goddess of the Praetorium\na goddess of fortune, do you think?
2	There're tourists who toss coins over\nthe edge at Milama Viewpoint, but a lot\nof them actually land around here.
3	And there's been more than usual with\nthe whole funeral business. I should\nthank the goddess for that, I suppose!
tlk4110017103_ms.json
1	There're tourists who toss coins over\nthe edge at Milama Viewpoint, but a lot\nof them actually land around here.
2	Though actually, I haven't seen that\nmany coming down lately. I guess\npeople lost interest?
3	Well, I've almost earned enough to go\nhome to Gormott anyway. I'm thinking\nof taking my dad along with me...
tlk4110017104_ms.json
1	Hey, you guys look like you're\ngreat at catching bugs!\nI'm right, aren't I?!
2	Listen, I'm making a specimen\ncollection!
3	I'm so close to finishing, but there's\nthis one insect I can't find anywhere!
4	I've searched high and low for it too...\nMaybe it's just the wrong kind of\nenvironment for it...
5	Argh! If I knew someone who was\ninto bug-catching, I'd've totally\ncaught it by now!
6	Wha-?! You're really gonna help me?!
7	Oh, wow! Awesome! Thanks so much!
tlk4110022101_ms.json
1	Soo, y'know how there's dead\nsparkly spots when you're walking\naround outside?
2	That's where my favorite bugs are!
3	Well, sometimes you can catch fish\nor pick veggies from them as well...
4	Oh, and also? If you have a Blade who\nknows their stuff, you can get a lot\nmore than you normally do!
5	I guess it's because they're showing\nyou how to do it prop'ly.
6	I wanna make friends with a Blade\nwho knows lots about bugs 'n' stuff\nso I can go bug hunting!
tlk4110022102_ms.json
1	Ain't no one in Gormott who knows\nmore about bugs than me! Ask away!
2	What should we ask about?
3	The Prairie Dragonfly
4	The Hexafly
5	The Giant Stag Beetle
6	The Prairie Dragonfly...
7	Wait a second... You can find those\npretty much anywhere in Gormott!
8	Everybody knows that!\nCome on, don't waste my time...
9	Hexafly? Uhh, that actually exists?
10	I've never caught one before.\nYou sure you're not making it up?\nYou're pulling my leg?
11	I guess I can't say for sure they don't\nexist... I'll have to study some more.
12	The Giant Stag Beetle...
13	You can find them out past Hermit's\nHollow toward Coolley Lake.
14	See? I know my stuff!
tlk4110022103_ms.json
1	I love bugs, me!
2	I know it's dangerous, but if I spot\na rare bug, I just have to chase it,\neven if it means going out of town.
3	I just can't help myself. Whenever\nI see a bug, I run right after them!
4	It's instinct or something. I just wanna\nscramble through the bushes to get\nto them. You know what I mean?
5	But, I mean, I don't want to put you\nguys through all that bother again.\nI'll be more careful in future.
tlk4110022104_ms.json
1	Why'd she give me such a whopping\ngreat shock?
2	Did I do something to deserve it?
3	I guess I shouldn't've let that Giant\nStag Beetle loose in the house...
4	Mum probably put her up to it, huh.
tlk4120012101_ms.json
1	My dad was saying that the way\nDrivers learn stuff is pretty different\nfrom normal people.
2	Like, they can use the experience\nthey've built up in the past to develop\nwhatever skills they need right now.
3	That's kind of the opposite of how\nit works normally, huh?
4	But it means Drivers have to stop and\nrest from time to time, to think about\nwhat skills are most important.
5	Don't forget to do that, OK?
tlk4120012102_ms.json
1	Oh, perfect timing.\nThere's something I've been wanting\nto ask Drivers and Blades like you.
2	You have to fight against\nmonsters a lot, right?
3	Have you ever seen any monsters get\nreally angry after taking damage?
4	How should we answer?
5	There are monsters like that
6	There aren't any monsters like that
7	I thought there must be!
8	After all, monsters are living\ncreatures too. They must get\nangry from time to time.
9	OK, here's my next question.
10	Are there any monsters out there\nthat actually block your attacks?
11	Wow, they do that too, huh?
12	I guess monsters like that would be\ntough to defeat, since you need to stop\nthem from guarding to deal damage.
13	OK, thanks for all your help.\nI'm going to brag to my dad that I know\nall this stuff about monsters now!
14	Really? None at all?
15	Maybe they're out there somewhere\nand you just haven't met them yet...
tlk4120012103_ms.json
1	Hey, listen - I heard Peline from\nCmalaf Artwork was looking for a\nnew owner to support her business.
2	But she won't accept just anyone.\nIt has to be someone who really\nappreciates artwork.
3	Maybe if you helped her increase her\nlineup or bought everything she's\nselling, she'd trust you enough to offer.
4	But what kind of benefits do you even\nget for owning a shop, anyway?
tlk4120012104_ms.json
1	Ah, you must be the new owner of\nCmalaf Artwork!
2	Why did you decide to become\nthe owner, anyway?
3	How should we respond?
4	To become stronger
5	To support beautiful art
6	You can get stronger by owning shops?\nWow! I had no idea.
7	Maybe you should try to become the\nowner of lots of different shops, then.\nThe sky's the limit, right?
8	...Oh, but I guess that means\nyou don't really have any passion\nfor the actual art they're selling?
9	I feel a bit sorry for Peline,\nknowing that...
10	A good answer if I ever heard one!
11	Peline was pretty over the moon,\nyou know. She always wanted to find\nan owner who shared her passion.
12	So it's best to act like you care,\nwhether you really mean it or not!
tlk4120012201_ms.json
1	I'm lookin' after Armoo!
2	They're cute an' fuzzy an' wuzzy\nan' they're a really purty n'animal!
3	They're s'posed to behave different\nin other places, but Gormotti Armoo're\nreally friendly an' gentle! Eeeee!
4	Armoo're useful for travel an' stuff too\n'cos they can carry stuff...an' yeah,\nthey're just really, really great!
5	An' that's everything I know\nabout Armoo. An' now you\nknow everything too!
tlk4120012202_ms.json
1	It's gunna be OK, Armoo...\nYou're safe now...
2	No, we are not OK! All the Armoo got\nsuper scared when that water tower\nfell over!
3	An' the grazing land's all gone squishy\nand mushy...
4	It's all Torna's fault! If they're gonna\ncall for backup, they should do it\nmore quiet-like!
5	There, there, little Armoo.\nIt's gonna be OK...
tlk4120012203_ms.json
1	Whee, it's time to feed the Armoo!\nTheir food's got a healthy balance\nof nutrition!
2	Armoo're herbivores, but they don't\njust eat grass all day, nope!
3	They need to trim their teeth down\non Ruby Mangosteens and they\nneed vitamins from Deadly Kiwis!
4	Does it sound like hard work?
5	Mmm, I don't mind. 'Cos I wuv my\nwittle Armoo, yes I do!
tlk4120012204_ms.json
1	Armoo look totally different in\nother countries! It's 'cos of the\nclimate and...and the eco-sumstem!
2	It's true! You can tell what a country's\nlike just by looking at its Armoo!
3	Like, Armoo're really angry in Mor'dain\nan' super-duper fluffy in Tantal!
4	Aww, I wish I could go traveling.\nI wanna go around the world petting\nall the Armoo I can find!
tlk4120012205_ms.json
1	I like it when it's nice an' peaceful.\nEveryone should just pet Armoo\ninstead of fighting!
2	They smell really nice like the\noutdoors and you can sleep\nsuper comfy on their back!
3	No, really! Everyone needs to have\nan Armoo!
4	Then Mor'dain an' Uraya'll stop\nfighting an' everyone can be happy!
5	They can just relax an' play with\nth'Armoo aaaaall day long.
6	It's Armoo therapy!
tlk4120012206_ms.json
1	So if Indol got destroyed, what\nhappened to all th'Armoo?!
2	Did they just let them die?!\nNo... How could they...
3	Huh? There're no Armoo there?\nGuess there're not much farms on\nIndol, huh...
4	I'm scared of all the people coming\nhere, though. What if they get so\nhungry that they eat all the Armoo?!
5	Oh no, what do I do?!\nMaybe I'll hide them in the forest...
6	Ahhhhhhhh!\nArmoo aren't tasty! They're really not!
tlk4120012301_ms.json
1	I'm gonna be a Driver when I'm older!
2	Mum doesn't like the idea. Or Dad.\nOr anyone! But I don't care!
3	A Driver in the army's already been\ntraining me, and I've learned loads\nof tips already!
4	Like, he has Blades with different\ntypes of weapon, from Ether Cannons\nto Shield Hammers to Megalances!
5	And they each have their different\nuses, so he needs to change the way\nhe fights to match each Blade!
6	Like, when he uses a Shield Hammer,\nhe tries to get lots of aggro from\nenemies to focus their attacks on him.
7	Being a Driver's a lot more work than\nyou'd expect!
tlk4120012302_ms.json
1	My trainer gave me some really useful\nadvice.
2	The closer a Driver and Blade are to\neach other, the stronger they'll be!
3	And the more you fight alongside\nyour Blade and the more missions they\ncomplete, the more Trust you'll gain.
4	On the other hand, the more your\nBlade grows, the more you'll get to\ngrow as a Driver!
5	Basically, everyone's a winner!
6	When I finally get to be a Driver,\nI want to make best friends with\nmy Blade!
tlk4120012303_ms.json
1	A bunch of Drivers got arrested by an\nArdainian squad at Twin Trunks Hill\nrecently.
2	Why would someone who got the\nchance to become a Driver go and\nruin it all by doing bad things...?
3	There are people who'd do anything\nto be a Driver! How dare they exploit\ntheir Blades like that!
tlk4120012304_ms.json
1	Rule 1 of the Driver's code:\nThink of all others\nas your sisters and brothers!
2	Oh, hey! I'm reciting the Driver's code.\nIt's an important part of my training!
3	Yep! My trainer told me that you\nneed a deep sense of self if you want\nto resonate with a Core Crystal!
4	The more tender your heart, the\nbetter the chance you'll have of\nresonating with a good Blade!
5	Rule 2 of the Driver's code:\nIf there's a person in trouble,\nhelp out on the double!
tlk4120012305_ms.json
1	Um, my trainer's kind of having\na bit of trouble right now...
2	They're not really getting along\nwith their Blade.
3	They go everywhere together, they\nwork together, fight together...but\nthey just don't seem to connect.
4	But I don't think that's true. If you keep\non fighting, even if it feels like the day'll\nnever come, someday you'll click!
5	That's not something your average\nDriver's able to do, though...
6	But if you could deepen your bond that\nfar...just think of the possibilities!
tlk4120012401_ms.json
1	Heya! Are you dying for cosmetics?\nWell, look no further - my cosmetics\nshop is here to fulfill your needs!
2	Well, if it isn't our very own owner!\nAlways nice to see you!
tlk4120012601_ms.json
1	Hey, you heard of a Torigonda?
2	Well, it's the instrument\nI'm playing right now.
3	I'm up every night practicing, but\nI'm still not good enough.
4	Us Gormotti love music, after all.\nI won't be a proper adult until I can\npull off a flawless performance!
tlk4120012602_ms.json
1	Gormotti love their national\ninstrument, the Torigonda!
2	But it's so hard to hit the right notes,\nand I'm starting to get fed up of hearing\nit. I want to play something else now...
3	Wouldn't it be nice if Gormott started\ncollaborating with other cultures to\nmake some totally new instrument?
4	I bet they'd come up with something\nreally weird and unique.
5	Hopefully not TOO weird, though.\nNo point if you can't get a decent\ntune out of it...
tlk4120012603_ms.json
1	Now we've got refugees both from\nIndol and Mor Ardain.
2	They're having a Torigonda concert\nfor them. Anything to ease their\nsorrows, they said.
3	I'm performing, too!
4	I know it's hard for them, but I hope\nthey get to enjoy the concert at least...
tlk4120012604_ms.json
1	Ahh, I wish I could hear Ursula's song\nagain...
2	Her voice was so pretty! And she was\nso good at playing the Torigonda!
3	And she genuinely looked like she\nwas having fun.
4	That's the sort of level I'm hoping to\nreach someday...
tlk4120012605_ms.json
1	Hey, guess what? Teetapz says he's\ngoing to make me into a star next!
2	I'm nowhere near as good as Ursula\njust yet, but still...
3	I want to be out there in Alba\nCavanich's plaza, performing\nmy heart out!
4	Ursula's show inspired me so much,\nI'll take to the stage with passion!
tlk4120014101_ms.json
1	Some Drivers took me and Dad away\nand before we knew it, we were here!
2	It was really, really scary...\nMy house got burned down...\nAnd I lost all my friends...
3	The people said we can't go back to\nCordell Village any more. I'm getting\nreally lonely...
tlk4120014102_ms.json
1	There are lotsa kids like me who lost\ntheir homes in the war here.
2	Not just kids from Cordell Village\neither. So many sad things are\nhappening all over the world...
3	Dad says the Garfont Mercs are here\nto stop the sad things happening.
4	Is that really true...?
tlk4120014103_ms.json
1	Mr. Cabott gave me a Gormotti\nWoodwing as a gift.
2	He bought it for me so it would remind\nme of home.
3	It's got this feathery pattern on it\nthat's the same as my old clothes.\nIt made me so happy...
4	I think I'm gonna be a dressmaker\nwhen I grow up.
5	Maybe someday, I'll be able to cheer\nup these people the same way they\ncheered me up!
tlk4120014105_ms.json
1	Everyone's talking about scary things\na lot right now, but sometimes we get\ngood news.
2	Like, I found out Rhys and the others\nare safe in Argentum!
3	Dad says he'll take me to see them\nonce all the fighting settles down.
4	I never thought I'd get to see my\nfriends again... Ahh, I can't wait!
tlk4120015101_ms.json
1	I can't believe big bro is a Driver now...
2	That means he has to go\nto Mor Ardain, right?
3	It's gonna be lonely without him, but\nI'll be fine. I gave him tons of advice\nbefore he left.
4	Like, to make sure he stays close\nto his Blade when he fights...
5	He needs to do that, 'cos that's\nhow you deepen your Affinity with\nyour Blade.
6	And when your Affinity deepens, you\nget stronger, and so does your Blade!
7	You'd do well to remember that too!
tlk4120015102_ms.json
1	It's been a while since our big bro Jac\nleft for Mor Ardain.
2	I hope he's not pushing himself\ntoo hard. If he gets sick, I'll be\nso angry!
3	Being a Driver for the Empire's\nsupposed to be really hard...
4	If the same thing were to happen\nto him as what happened to Ma,\nI couldn't bear it...
tlk4120015103_ms.json
1	Woo-hoo! Big bro's back! And\nthis time, he's staying for good!
2	Thank you so, so much for helping us!
3	I still can't believe it... Pa's really back.
4	I thought he'd just be lazing about the\nway he used to and everything was\ngoing to be horrible, but I was wrong.
5	He's working as hard as he can, and\nhe's being really nice to us! I'm sure Ma\nwould be happy to see us like this now!
6	Pa's still not come back after all this\ntime...
7	That's why from this day forth, I'm\nstanding in as representative Ma!
8	Umm, although now that I think about\nit, I guess that's kinda embarrassing!
tlk4120017101_ms.json
1	I poured my heart into baking these\nbikkies. Would you care to try one?
2	Thank you kindly! That's sure to\nbrighten up everyone's day at the\ncamp. Come again!
tlk4130001101_ms.json
1	Hey, Rex! Looks like you've got quite\nthe salvaging business going on there!
2	Been to Central Exchange yet?
3	You should bring your haul along\nthere. Collectibles, treasure,\nwhatever's in your pockets.
4	You'll get a better deal if you can\nsell 'em off in bulk.
5	Playing the market in your favor\nis the mark of a true salvager!
tlk4130001102_ms.json
1	There was a bidding war between an\nArdainian and an Urayan just now.
2	Even when it's the tiniest little thing,\nthey still find a way to be at each\nother's throats.
3	I just hope Mor Ardain and Uraya's\nstupid rivalry won't blow up into a\nfull-scale war.
4	Only the smallest fraction of people\nbenefit when the world is at war,\nafter all...
tlk4130001103_ms.json
1	Mor Ardain and Uraya were like,\na hair-trigger away from full-blown\nwarfare, right?
2	Well I'm glad it never amounted to\nanything in the end.
3	I guess we can thank the Praetor for\ndefusing the situation there.
4	If war had broken out, I'd probably\nhave had to go back to Gormott and\nfight for Mor Ardain.
5	Sure dodged that bullet!
tlk4130001104_ms.json
1	So how many nations is that hugging\nthe World Tree now? Three? Four?
2	When I heard the news, I thought to\nmyself, "That's it, Alrest is done for."
3	But seeing the tenacity of these Nopon\nmerchants, I realized there was no\npoint in me worrying.
4	They just keep raking in the cash like\nthere's no tomorrow. Literally.
5	Gutsy little beggars, the lot of them.
tlk4130001201_ms.json
1	There's this legendary merc\na pal of mine told me about,\nZoquim.
2	And get this: he's got a huge sweet\ntooth. Can't say no to a Cinnopon Roll.
3	Just one Cinnopon Roll and he'll\nbe pumped for the next battle.
4	It's similar to how my wife's got a\nserious thing for Eau de Doux.
5	Pleasant smells are conducive to a\ngood working environment, she says.
6	You should find that special something\nthat peps you up as well.
tlk4130001202_ms.json
1	So I hear someone seriously vandalized\nthe water tower in Torigoth.
2	Naturally, I felt I should do something\nto chip in. Any respectable Gormotti\nwould do the same.
3	I already sent them over some iron,\nso here's hoping they'll be able to\nrestore it.
4	But who'd do a thing like that\nanyway? Was it that Torna bunch\nthat everyone's been talking about?
tlk4130001203_ms.json
1	Well, I hear Chairman Bana's\nbeen de-chaired.
2	Can't say I'm surprised. We all knew\nhe was involved in shady business.
3	He had some wacky business venture\ngoing on in Mor Ardain, I hear.
4	And he was trying to turn it over\nto Torna, or something or other.
5	Yeah, that's not OK in my book.
6	In the meantime, Niranira's taken over\nas interim chairman. Wonder how long\nit'll be before a new one's appointed?
7	They'll have to hurry it up a bit if they\ndon't want to lose out on deals...
tlk4130001204_ms.json
1	You're the ones who caught former\nChairman Bana's dad, aren't you?
2	Well, more power to you!
3	Not even the SAB could get a hold\nof that slimeball.
4	But still, he wasn't completely\nheartless. I think he softened up\na little after his son was born.
5	And the two of them did make the\nguild what it is today. I wonder what's\ngoing to become of it now...?
tlk4130001205_ms.json
1	I can't believe this...\nAre we going to have to cancel\nnegotiations now?
2	Some Lysaat found their way into our\ncargo hold, would you believe it.
3	We were supposed to be starting\nbusiness talks, but I can't exactly\nsend the ship out now...
4	I asked Argentum security to sort it\nout, but they got scared and ran off!
5	Now that, my friends, would be\nabsolutely pukka. You look like\nyou could handle them.
6	Well, best of luck!
tlk4130002101_ms.json
1	Running a shop here, you get to\nhear all sorts of interesting gossip.
2	It's right by the port, so we get to see\na lot of adventurers and merchants.
3	For instance, did you know every\nTitan has a few out-of-the-way spots\nknown as Secret Areas?
4	In Gormott, for instance, there's a place\ncalled Dawnview Grotto which has the\nmost exquisite view you ever saw.
5	Part of the thrill of adventuring is\nseeking out the kinds of places and\nviews that make you really feel alive!
tlk4130002102_ms.json
1	A long time ago, there was a city in\nGormott known only as the White Chair.
2	It had the oldest and richest history\nof any city in the land, and boasted a\nfortress many considered impenetrable.
3	But that city was destroyed by the\nArdainian Empire. Razed to the ground,\nuntil nothing remained.
4	The destruction of the White Chair was\nwhat prompted Gormott to surrender\ntheir sovereignty to Mor Ardain.
5	But this all happened long before I\nwas born. I don't resent Mor Ardain\nfor what their ancestors did.
tlk4130002103_ms.json
1	I hear Mor Ardain almost started\nanother war.
2	But it turned out Torna was behind\neverything. I'm just glad the conflict\nwas stopped before it was too late.
3	If war were to really break out,\nI don't doubt Uraya would make\nGormott a target.
4	And this city, with its large military\nbase, could easily become a battlefield.
5	I would hate to see Torigoth razed\nto the ground like the White Chair,\ncity of my ancestors.
6	A ceasefire is the best outcome\nwe Gormotti can hope for.
tlk4130002104_ms.json
1	Lately, the adventurers and merchants\nwho visit this port have a constant edge\nof worry in their voices.
2	The great Titan of Indol has sunk\nbeneath the clouds, and three others\nhave gathered around the World Tree...
3	Nothing about any of this is normal.
4	Gormott is still quite far from the Tree,\nbut I'm sure we will be plagued with\npeople fleeing from the danger zone.
5	How did the world come to this...?
6	It feels like the notion of peace has\nfaded away into a distant dream.
tlk4130002107_ms.json
1	Do you know of the ancient Gormotti\nRitual of Plenty?
2	The ritual performed every year\nin Kizan Valley?
3	Each year, a maiden is chosen to\ntravel to the sacred grounds and\npray for a good year's harvest.
4	Those sacred grounds lie deep\nin Kizan Valley.
5	However, it seems that some kind of\nsuspicious interlopers have recently\nbeen intruding upon the valley.
6	We cannot allow such a sacred\nplace to be defiled.
7	Would you lend us your aid to\nexpel these interlopers?
8	Thank you so much.\nPlease take care.
tlk4130002201_ms.json
1	Gormott's such a peaceful place.\nNever seen it any other way.
2	I'm with the Militia Corps, but we've so\nmuch free time on our hands, we don't\nknow what to do with ourselves.
3	What with us and the Ardainian army\nstationed here, no one dares start\nmaking any trouble.
4	There was a tiny little incident a short\nwhile back, but I don't suppose much\ncame of it.
tlk4130002202_ms.json
1	Gotta say I was shocked\nby recent events!
2	I mean, I'd heard rumors about Torna\ncoming to town, but I never thought\nmuch would come of it.
3	But then they went off on a rampage in\nan imperial battleship, and to top it off,\ndestroyed our water tower!
4	What a wicked bunch...
5	Anyway, I'm glad they're gone now.\nThe sooner the town settles back down\nto its old peaceful self, the better.
6	It's just a relief we didn't get involved.\nIf the Flamebringer couldn't even take\n'em, what chance would we have had?
tlk4130002203_ms.json
1	Oh, hey.\nThinking of joining the vigilantes, are\nyou? Kidding, kidding!
2	An Ardainian acquaintance of mine\ntold me they're secretly manufacturing\nsome kind of artificial Blades.
3	Apparently, they don't even need to\nbond or anything like that? I don't\nknow if there's any truth in it...
4	Wish I could get one to help me out\nwith the vigilantes. We're so short-\nstaffed right now...
tlk4130002204_ms.json
1	Oh, hey.\nThinking of joining the vigilantes, are\nyou? Kidding, kidding!
2	I heard Torna's behind this latest\ntrouble again. They really need to\ngive it a rest.
3	They attacked us once before, right?\nEveryone's shaken enough as it is.\nDamn nuisance, that's what they are.
4	We've been rounding up vigilantes to\nwatch the streets, but even still, we\ncouldn't measure up to Torna.
5	At the moment, we're investing all our\neffort in the refugee crisis. I feel\nexhausted just thinking about it...
tlk4130002205_ms.json
1	Oh, hey.\nThinking of joining the vigilantes, are\nyou? Kidding, kidding!
2	Heard they caught Chairman Bana\nfrom the Argentum Trade Guild.
3	The Nopon merchants are all up in\narms about it. Looks like some of\nthem really looked up to him.
4	Us vigilantes are on high alert making\nsure the critters don't hike up the\nprices and rip people off.
5	It's hard work, but we'll manage.\nI just pray that this is the end of\nour troubles...
tlk4130002206_ms.json
1	Oh, hey.\nThinking of joining the vigilantes, are\nyou? Kidding, kidding!
2	Sometimes I wonder why I'm the\none putting up with all the stress\nof keeping the vigilantes in check.
3	It was fine at first. This was a peaceful\ntown. Nothing to deal with but lost\nitems and petty squabbles. But now...
4	I know we'll make it through this.\nI love this town and I love its people.
5	I just wish that Torna lot would pipe\ndown for a while...
tlk4130002207_ms.json
1	Oh, hey.\nThinking of joining the vigilantes, are\nyou? Kidding, kidding!
2	I've just issued orders to our\nresident vigilantes.
3	Immigrants from Mor Ardain have been\non the increase lately. No one wants\nto stay aboard a sinking ship.
4	Looks like I turned into a veteran\novernight! Well, we've just got to\nroll with the punches!

1	I feel so pathetic... Back on Gormott,\nI used to harvest my own food, but\nnow it's just handed out to me.
2	I fled to Indol to escape Mor Ardain...\nbut Indol is the cause of this war in\nthe first place.
3	Just think about it. This is where all of\nMor Ardain's Blades are managed.
4	If they don't want war, they shouldn't\nbe sending out Blades at all. They're\nlike some kind of arms dealer...
tlk4130007202_ms.json
1	The Goddess of the Praetorium is dead,\nI hear.
2	That's what they get for dealing\nin Blades and sending them out\nto Mor Ardain and Uraya.
3	...Sorry, that was disrespectful of me.\nPretend you didn't hear any of that.
4	That goddess was the reason we got\nall our food rations, after all.
tlk4130007203_ms.json
1	Us refugees are never given any\nconcrete information.
2	Like what's the deal with the\nArdainian-Urayan war? Is it over?\nAre they still fighting?
3	We're all kept in the dark. But there\nis one thing I'm sure of...
4	As long as Indol is left in control of its\nBlades, the fighting's not going to end.
tlk4130009101_ms.json
1	Hey, thanks for coming! As you can\nsee, we made it to Mor Ardain in one\npiece!
2	I feel bad about doing that to\nRhiannon's parents, I really do...
3	But Rhiannon's happiness is what's\nmost important to me.
4	Oh, before I forget, there's something\nI've been meaning to give you. Here.
5	It looks like I might have made things\nmore difficult than I thought for\nRhiannon, moving to Mor Ardain.
6	There's all the tension with Uraya\nand the Titan getting weaker... It's\none thing after the other, really.
7	But I'll do everything I can to support\nher! I promised her a better life and\nthat's what she'll have, you'll see!
tlk4130009102_ms.json
1	Hey, thanks for visiting!\nAnd thanks as well for telling us\nabout Rhiannon's family.
2	Rhiannon's da wasn't willing to talk\nto me before, but her ma managed to\npersuade him.
3	She said if the two of us can be happy,\nthen maybe that'll pave the way for\nour countries to live in harmony too.
4	After that, I told them all about our\nplans and they approved of us getting\nmarried! You've helped us so much...
tlk4130012101_ms.json
1	Well look who it is! You really saved\nus a lot of work back there. Thanks\nfor helping out with the repairs!
2	Oh yeah, about those Tirkin.\nThey're helping out with guard\nduty over on Rahim's tower.
3	You really taught them a lesson, but I\nfelt a bit sorry for them, so I offered\nthem the job. They're good birds.

2	And as I have sworn, I will serve to\nprotect this town and the Merc Group.
3	I understand that Jelved may not see\nme in the best light...

1	Hey, there!\nYou've done so much for me recently,\nI can't thank you enough.
2	Da's still under investigation, but it\nlooks like everything he's telling\nthem is the truth.
3	There's room for extenuating\ncircumstances, it seems. Maybe one\nday, he'll be able to go back home.
tlk4131015102_ms.json
1	Hey, there!\nYou've done so much for me recently,\nI can't thank you enough.
2	So in the end, Da went back to\nTorigoth. He's living together with\nmy siblings now.
3	I heard he's started making an honest\nliving. I think Ma would be proud...

1	They haven't been making much\nheadway with Senator Stulc's inquiry.
2	They're tiptoeing around the whole\naffair like they're afraid of something.
3	Can a rebel faction affiliated with some\nNopon really be that dangerous?
tlk4131015104_ms.json
1	I heard you subdued that rebel faction,\nLindwurm. You know, I'm starting to\nthink you can do anything!
2	Both Don Dondon and Bana are under\nlock and key, and Senator Stulc's\nfinally started giving his testimony.
3	I know it's strange coming from me,\nbut thank you. For everything.
4	You've saved the empire, which\nmeans I'm not out of a job, and\nI can still provide for my family!
tlk4140001101_ms.json
1	There's a look about you...\nthe look of someone who buys\na lot of things at shops!
2	I'm an up-and-coming economist,\nand I'm trying to encourage people\nto up their consumer activity.
3	Whether buying or selling, what matters\nis that money changes hands. That's\nwhat keeps the economy flowing!
4	And if the economy thrives,\nso will this city!
5	What's that mean for you,\nI hear you ask?
6	Well, it means you'll be able to\nbuy things cheaper!
7	Isn't economics wonderful?
tlk4140001103_ms.json
1	Nopon love Samod a bit too much,\nif you ask me. It's like Juicy Samod\nis all anyone eats around here!
2	I mean, it's not bad, but you start\nto get sick of it after a while.
3	The good news is, though, I know\na way to solve this problem!
4	Making this city's economy thrive!
5	The more the city thrives, the more\nit'll start trading with other cities.
6	And that means more options for us\ncustomers to buy in the shops!
7	Though of course, you can't have trade\nwithout securing trade routes. We might\nneed mercenary help on that front...
tlk4140001104_ms.json
1	You have the air of a shop owner\nabout you.
2	What do you think happens if you\nbuy a shop's entire stock?
3	The shopkeeper will be so impressed\nby your love for their business, they'll\nask you to become the shop's owner.
4	Becoming a shop owner costs quite\na bit of money, but you get a lot of\nbenefits out of it!
tlk4140001105_ms.json
1	Quite the state Alrest is in\nthese days, eh?
2	Yet somehow the economy seems to\ngo on pretty much as usual.
3	There hasn't been any looting, and the\nvalue of money hasn't really changed.
4	Maybe the people of Alrest are more\nfull of hope than I gave them credit for.
5	I hope you'll keep buying and\nselling and generally contributing\nto the city's economy, too.

1	Nature and greenery are the heart of\nGormott! If you're after a souvenir,\nmake sure it's real Gormotti wood!
2	Grand, isn't it? If there's one thing\nTorigoth has over the rest of Gormott,\nit's the quality of the trees!
3	So of course you'll find better wooden\ncraftwork here than anywhere else in\nthe land! All of it handmade, too!
4	Just take some of these beauties\nin your hands. I can guarantee\nyou'll be smitten!

3	Here in Gormott, we use Puzzletree\nWood for everything from grand houses\nto tiny accessories!
4	I don't know how we'd get by\nwithout the stuff.
5	You can gather Puzzletree Wood from\na lot of the trees round here, so try\ncollecting it. It might come in handy!

1	From what I hear, there's an incredible\nsculptor living in Uraya!
2	Apparently he creates the most\nwonderful sculptures of Queen Raqura.\nNothing like them in all of Alrest!
3	Someday, I want to see what a\nsculptor as fine as that could do\nwith Gormotti wood.
4	Perhaps if we strengthen our\ntrade links with Uraya, it could\nhappen eventually...
5	I can almost picture it now...\nThe Wood-Carven Queen!\nAh, what a sight it would be.
tlk4140002104_ms.json
1	Have you heard of Woodboards?!\nYou've gotta get into Woodboards!\nEveryone's talking about them!
2	By combining advanced Ardainian tech\nwith Puzzletree Wood from Gormott,\na new musical instrument was born!
3	Thanks to the supreme flexibility of\nPuzzletree Wood, this new instrument\nproduces tones like an angelic chorus!
4	And it's called...the Woodboard!\nI named it myself, by the way.
5	It's like a keyboard made of wood, so...\nWoodboard! I'm a genius, right?

5	It's actually produced here in Torigoth,\nbut it's not exactly the most popular\nthing around here. Only in Pom!
6	Which is why my husband's in the\nbusiness of delivering it. Only thing is,\nthe roads are pretty dangerous lately...
7	I'm actually looking for some cheap,\ndecent bodyguards to help him out.

3	Yew, Zuo...not to mention you guys...\nYou're all a part of the family.
tlk4140004203_ms.json
1	That Damida's shaping out to be quite\nthe capable recruit.
2	Sure he throws his weight around, but\nhis skills are not to be sniffed at. Even\nthe Nopon hold him in high regard.
3	I can see why he was hired as a spy.
4	Well, he's on our side now. At least,\nuntil the Fusty Fungus underground\nruns out...
tlk4140004301_ms.json
1	Thanks a lot for picking me! I can tell\nyou're a great bunch.
2	The big man's a tough act to follow,\nbut I see you've already earned their\ntrust.
3	Well then, I'll do my very best to live\nup to your expectations!
tlk4140004302_ms.json
1	Thanks a lot for picking me! I can tell\nyou're a great bunch.
2	I'm acting as head chef during the\nevening.
3	Making sure everyone's content is\npart of the job, and keeping their\nbellies full is no exception!
tlk4140007101_ms.json
1	I fled to Indol and made a new life\nfor myself here. How many years\nhas it been now...?
2	Interested, are you? There's not much\nto say. I get out of bed, get my rations,\nwander about for a bit, then sleep.
3	Everyone blames Mor Ardain for\nannexing Gormott, and- Wait, are\nthose Blades with you?!
4	Those Blades burned my house down,\ndestroyed everything I loved! Down\nwith Blades! Down with them, I say!
tlk4140007102_ms.json
1	So APPARENTLY the bigwigs are\nhaving some kind of meeting to put\nan end to the war peacefully.
2	I just can't see the conflict really\nending, not as long as there are\nBlades in the world.
3	You may as well be walking around\ntoting weapons in everyone's faces.
4	Down with Blades! We'll never have\ntrue peace until we rid the world of\nBlades completely!
tlk4140007103_ms.json
1	あたしはあなたみたいな人が羨ましいわ\n気軽に世界を旅立てるなんて
2	あたしはもう10年前からここにいるのに\nあなたとあたしで何が違うのかしら
3	生まれた場所？　ブレイドを持つかどうか？\nそんなのあたしにはどうしようもないわよね
4	きっとあたしは運が悪かったのよ\n生まれてくる時代を間違えたんだわ
tlk4140007201_ms.json
1	I see you have Blades with you.\nThen I have something to ask of you.
2	Please just...don't hurt us.\nThe common people. We are powerless\nagainst you and your Blades...
3	Those with the aptitude to be a Driver\nand soldiers trained for war have the\npower to oppose others, but us?
4	All we want is to live our lives in peace\nand quiet. Blades have taken away our\nhomes, our families...
tlk4140007202_ms.json
1	If it weren't for Blades, we would all be\nable to live here in Gormott in peace.
2	And yet, perhaps then I wouldn't\nbe here today...
3	I slipped on the outer wall the\nother day and fell onto the\nback of the Indoline Titan.
4	I cried for help, but no one seemed to\nnotice my absence. I thought that was\nit for me, but then a Blade saved me.
5	I know it's not the Blades we should\nbe blaming, it's the ones in control\nof them...but still...
tlk4140007203_ms.json
1	I believe one day we'll get word that\nthe war is over.
2	I believe we'll all get to go home, me \nand the other refugees.
3	I guess I can keep my spirits up every\nday because I believe peace will come.
4	So people like you - with Blades - have\nto keep working towards that peace.\nPeople like me are counting on you.
tlk4140092101_ms.json
1	Thanks for the help last time.\nUm...Therida...she...
2	She says she won't be satisfied until\nshe sees her prince. She won't budge\nan inch from this spot.
3	I just want to go back to the inn...
4	She said she's not dirty because she's\nbeen frozen in ice for five years.\nShe still hasn't taken a bath...
tlk4170012101_ms.json
1	What d'you want? This is a woodcraft\nworkshop. It's no place for kids.
2	Well, what we do here is we take wood\nfrom Gormotti trees and prepare it for\na variety of uses.
3	For instance, we build frames of\nPuzzletree Wood strengthened with\nMuscle Branches for use in buildings.
4	It's a pretty tricky process, so I\nwouldn't advise it, but...I guess you\ncan try your hand if you like?
5	Good call. It's a bit of a dangerous job\nto try out of curiosity alone.
tlk4170012102_ms.json
1	So Gormott's been under Ardainian rule\nfor nearly 50 years now, huh...
2	Gormott used to have its own army, you\nknow. My dad was an officer there. Not\nthat you'd know it to look at him now.
3	After Gormott was defeated, the army\nwas disbanded, and all we have now\nare small defense corps for each tribe.
4	It may seem we're being oppressed,\nbut if you look at it another way, we're\nalso under Mor Ardain's protection.
5	The Ardainians don't really interfere\nwith our culture. That's something to\nbe grateful for, if you ask me.
tlk4170012103_ms.json
1	I heard that Titan battleship got\nattacked. And by a group of rebels\ntrying to save that wanted girl Nia, too!
2	They must be a force to be reckoned\nwith. Even Mòrag, Mor Ardain's greatest\nDriver, couldn't capture them.
3	If she can't take them, there's nothing\nus ordinary folk of Torigoth can do.\nJust gotta wait for this all to blow over.
4	I only hope it doesn't get too\nout of control. Don't want the\ncity getting damaged.
tlk4170012104_ms.json
1	That Cordell Village, the one that got\noccupied by bandits... Yeah, I don't\nthink there's any hope of it recovering.
2	Pretty much all the residents were\nkilled, and the buildings were ruined\nas well. What can you do at that point?
3	It was only a small village, without even\na military station, but still...people sure\ndo some awful things, huh.
4	I can only pray for the people of\nCordell to rest in peace.
tlk4170012105_ms.json
1	Mor Ardain and Uraya... When war\nfinally breaks out between those two,\nI'm sure Gormott will get mixed up in it.
2	But we don't have any fighting forces\nof our own. In the end, we're just at the\nmercy of whichever side is victorious.
3	All we can do is pray that whichever\ncountry wins won't harm our culture\ntoo much.
4	Though of course, the best outcome\nis if they never go to war to begin with.
tlk4170012106_ms.json
1	About a decade ago, the leadership of\na town ruled by one of Gormott's seven\nmain clans changed hands.
2	The old leader had two daughters,\nbut one of them was really sickly.
3	He was spending crazy amounts of\nmoney on medical care for her.
4	Including money from his\npeople's taxes.
5	It's not like I can't empathize.\nAny father would want to do whatever\nhe could to save his precious daughter.
6	But when you're leader of a whole clan,\na whole town...you have responsibilities.
7	Not like Consul Dughall was any\nbetter, mind. I hope we get a half-\ndecent consul next time...
tlk4170012107_ms.json
1	Right now, the people of Torigoth are\ndoing everything they can to get new\nhouses built for the refugees.
2	After all, they can hardly live\nin tents in the Ardainian army\nbase forever.
3	It's only natural that many of them are\ndepressed or angry. How can they feel\nsafe without a roof over their heads?
tlk4170012201_ms.json
1	You after something?\nThis is Torigoth's number one farm.
2	All the Gormotti folk working here at\nKloom Farm are my own family.
3	We've been supporting the farming\nindustry in Torigoth for generations.\nA heck of a lot of generations.
4	Since you're here, why don't you take\na few of our vegetables as a souvenir?
tlk4170012202_ms.json
1	That water tower's well good\nand busted now.
2	Thankfully, we can get by for\nthe moment drawing water\nfrom Coolley Lake...
3	But some of the lakes around here\nare contaminated, so I'm a little worried\nabout how it'll affect our crops.
4	What use is it having the Empire's\nstrongest Driver around if she can't\neven do anything when villains attack?
5	I sure hope the Ardainian army catch\nwhoever was responsible for this mess.
tlk4170012203_ms.json
1	I hear the Imperial Army captured\nthose dirty bandits who razed\nCordell Village.
2	Guess things'll be more peaceful\naround here for now.
3	It's a real shame what happened\nto all the villagers, though.
4	If nothing else, I'm going to miss\nthose juicy Moonbeam Bananas\nthey produced!
5	Oh yeah, I heard that boy Otto was\ntalking about came from Cordell, too.
6	Sounds like he was up to a spot of\nmischief, but now he's straightened\nup and is working hard in Argentum.
7	Here's hoping he manages to put that\ntragedy behind him and grow up strong.
tlk4170012205_ms.json
1	Have you tried those Nopon Radishes\nNomon makes? They're exquisite.
2	Sometimes I feel a bit guilty slicing\nthem, with how they're shaped and all,\nbut it's actually good stress relief too!
3	And at the end of the day, that\ntaste is just the best. They're a\nquality product inside and out.
4	I made the right decision, lending\nmy field out to that Nopon.
tlk4170012206_ms.json
1	A bunch of refugees from Indol have\nwound up in Torigoth, but never fear.\nKloom Farm can provide for them all!
2	Be it a hundred people or a thousand,\nwe'll feed 'em all on our tasty veg!
3	Each one of our vegetables is packed\nto bursting with nutrients, so there's\nno chance they'll go hungry.
4	Hahaha! This is all thanks to the\nhard work my family's put in over\nthe generations.
tlk4170012301_ms.json
1	Hey there! If you're after Core\nChips, take a look around!
tlk4170012401_ms.json
1	We serve the best meat in all of Alrest,\nand that's a promise! Come give it a try!
2	We work closely with the farms to\nensure we get the best-tasting, highest-\nquality and healthiest meat around!
3	Good to see you around, owner!\nIf it's the best meat in Alrest you're\nafter, you always know where to come!
tlk4170012501_ms.json
1	Well, hello there!
2	Our Torigoth specialties use ultra-fine\ngrain ground by a windmill. You can't\ngo wrong with these!
3	Why, if it isn't our owner!\nAlways a pleasure.
tlk4170012502_ms.json
1	Come in, come in! Here for some of our\nLucky Dawn Bread, are you? Well,\nfeel free to look around!
tlk4170012601_ms.json
1	Hey, how's tricks? Been putting\nthat Perfect Range Sensor I gave\nyou to good use?
2	Good on you!
3	Me? I've been out and about hiking\nall over Alrest.
4	I'm studying flora from all over the\nworld, see. And I'm learning more\nand more by the day!
5	I finished the first leg of my journey,\nso I'm catching a bit of R&R back at\nthe old homestead for now.
6	Field research's ace, but it's writing up\nthe research paper that I'm dreading...
7	Well, I'll scrape something together\nsomehow.
tlk4170012602_ms.json
1	Little Floren really loves her nature,\ndoesn't she?
2	I hope one day I can bring her with\nme and show her all the amazing flora\nAlrest's got to offer.
3	I'll keep her safe, don't you worry.\nIt's the duty of the strong to take\ncare of the meek.
4	'Course, I'd need to be a Driver for all\nthis to happen.
5	Frankly, I'm jealous. What I wouldn't\ngive to share the company of a lovely\nlady like her...
tlk4170012603_ms.json
1	Have I told you about how I've\ntraveled all over Alrest as a botanist?
2	Let me give you a few tips.
3	What would you like to know?
4	What will I ask about?
5	Rare flora in Uraya
6	Rare flora in Mor Ardain
7	Rare flora in Tantal
8	Ever hear of the Sirius Anemone?
9	You don't see many around too often,\nbut you can usually find them down in\nthe Fonsa Myma Waters.
10	Well? Did I help, or did I help?
11	Have you heard of the Amber Leaf?
12	It's rare finding any kind of plant life\nin Mor Ardain due to its aridity, but I\nfound some in the Old City of Teddim.
13	Well? Did I help, or did I help?
14	Tantal?!
15	Never thought you'd be asking\nme about that place...
16	I'm afraid I can't help you there, mate.
17	Tantal's a closed-off country and\nseldom few are allowed in.
18	Plus you never know where the Titan's\ngoing to be from one day to the next!
19	Heh, I guess I'm not done with my\nresearch just yet!
tlk4170012604_ms.json
1	So the World Tree didn't budge an inch\neven after a Titan bumped right into it?\nWhat must that thing be made of?!
2	As a botanist, naturally the World Tree\npiques my curiosity to no end!
3	What I wouldn't give to examine it for\nmyself someday... I could take young\nElis along too, do a bit of fieldwork.
4	Elis is this kid in town who takes\ncare of the trees.
5	He's got quite an appreciation for\nnature, and he even told me he wants\nto be a botanist when he's older.
6	So I figure it's my duty to be a\ngood example for him, you know.\nSet him on the right track.
tlk4170012701_ms.json
1	Thank you kindly for all your hard\nwork! I was able to create some\nfine furniture thanks to you!
2	I don't think my esteemed customer\nfrom Mor Ardain will have room to\ncomplain now.
3	My son's learned a valuable lesson,\ntoo. Not so flippant about his errand-\nrunning now, let me tell you!
tlk4170014101_ms.json
1	Granddad and I may not have a place\nto go back to, but we're still getting by\nwith our tech. Come and see!
tlk4170015101_ms.json
1	Have you ever ventured down to the\nlevels below Alba Cavanich?
2	You can only get down there when\nthe Cloud Sea is low.
3	Nations like Gormott and Mor Ardain\nthat are built on the surface of Titans\nare at the mercy of the Cloud Sea level.
4	That's why we tend to build our cities\non high ground, where the Cloud Sea\nlevel doesn't have so much effect.
5	Sometimes I envy nations like Argentum\nthat float on the Cloud Sea, and Uraya\nwhere they live inside the Titan itself.
tlk4170015102_ms.json
1	This area has a lot of residents who\naren't of the native Ardainian race.
2	That's partly because property is cheap\nnear all these warehouses, but also,\nGormotti folk just like to stick together.
3	Only problem is, the local Ardainians\ndon't think people from this area are\nvery trustworthy.
4	When I tell people I live on the Admar\nwall, they look at me with pity.
5	It's silly, really. This place has\na great view, and it gives you a\nsense of freedom.
6	I guess there is always the danger of\nfalling... Who even knows what's\nlurking down below here?
7	But once you get used to it,\nit's really not so bad.
tlk4170015103_ms.json
1	I used to think this was a fine place\nto live as long as you're used to it...
2	But then I found out the anti-imperial\norganization Brionac had a hideout\nright below here!
3	I mean, no wonder the Ardainians\naren't keen on this area with a nasty\nlot like them hanging around...
4	I didn't know much about Brionac\nup until just recently...
5	But I guess if I'm going to live here in\nMor Ardain, I should be more sensitive\nto those kinds of issues.
tlk4170015104_ms.json
1	Well, I did my research, and I feel\nlike I'm properly informed about\nBrionac now.
2	Apparently they're an organization who\nwant to overthrow the current Emperor.
3	The current Emperor strives for peace,\nbut some people want Mor Ardain to\nproactively conquer more territory.
4	The word on the street is that Brionac\nis probably supported by a radical\nfaction within the Senate.
5	Brionac is made up of highly patriotic\nArdainians - people who believe in the\nglory of the Empire.
6	But apparently there's also a different\norganization called Lindwurm.
7	Unlike Brionac, Lindwurm is primarily\nmade up of non-Ardainians.
8	Rather than opposing the current\nEmperor specifically, they're more\nopposed to the Ardainian Empire itself.
9	Their activities are supposedly\nmasterminded by Urayan nobility\nand Nopon merchants.
10	Since Lindwurm's objective is to crush\nthe Empire itself, they see both the\nImperial Army and Brionac as enemies.
11	Recently, though, Lindwurm's leader\nmade some rash moves in an attempt to\navenge his son, and was taken down.
12	So both organizations are in tatters at\nthis point. The handful of radicals that\nremain are no threat to the Emperor.
tlk4170016101_ms.json
1	You were the passengers on board that\nship from Mor Ardain, weren't you?
2	Are you heading to Fonsett?\nYou'll need to pass through one\nof the cloudways then.
3	There are two paths you could take.\nLud Cloudway's the closer one, but the\nroute's full of dangerous monsters.
4	If I were you, I'd take Orl Cloudway\ninstead. Once you reach Baldotas Isle,\nhead for Daram Isle to get there.
tlk4170016102_ms.json
1	The Leftherian Titan's meant to be\nhidden somewhere in the Cloud Sea\nridge, but I've never actually seen it.
2	I tried navigating Lud Cloudway\nmyself just to get a peek, but it\ndidn't go so well.
3	The monsters there are tough blighters.\nThey kept hounding me. I didn't even\nget to see a trace of the Titan.
4	If you do happen to find it, don't tell\nme what it looks like. I want to see it\nwith my own two eyes.
tlk4170017201_ms.json
1	I think the world would be better off\nif we didn't have Blades.
2	Wait...YOU'VE got Blades!
3	I'll have you know my family was killed\nby Ardainian Blades!
4	Every Blade in Alrest is controlled\nby Indol. So really, it's Indol that's\nresponsible for all of this!
5	Making amends by letting in refugees?\nWell sorry, but that's too little, too late.\nI hope we drain them dry!
tlk4170017202_ms.json
1	This is getting beyond a joke. Are they\ntrying to start a war here?
2	Both the Urayan and Ardainian armies\nare here. In Indol.
3	You people have Blades. You know\nsomething about this, don't you?
4	Oh, I see how it is. Can't let the\nrefugees in on the news? Whose fault\nis it that this all happened, eh?
tlk4170017203_ms.json
1	When the Urayan and Ardainian armies\ncame to visit, we made sure they got\nto see our protests in full swing.
2	Practically all Blades are maintained\nin Indol. There has to be some dissent\nabout that among their ranks.
3	You're a Driver. You agree with me,\ndon't you? We can't just let another\ncountry lord it over us like this!
tlk4170022201_ms.json
1	My name's Otto, and I'm the foreman\nhere at Nocclia Timber Site.
2	We fell the trees here, and transport\nthe timber over to Saets Lumber Co.\nin Torigoth for processing.
3	Then they can be used to make\nfurniture, musical instruments,\nyou name it.
4	A lot of it also gets exported to\nMor Ardain or Argentum.
5	Gormotti wood's quality stuff, see.\nIt's sought-after all over Alrest.
tlk4170022202_ms.json
1	Listen, there's no such thing as\na Driver who travels alone.
2	Every Driver has Blades around to\nhelp out with their unique knowledge\nand skills, see?
3	Some Blades can track footprints with\namazing precision, others can smash\nhuge rocks or burn up fallen trees.
4	When you choose which Blades to bring\nwith you, you gotta consider those kind\nof skills, not just who's best in a fight.
tlk4170022203_ms.json
1	Since I spend all my time chopping\ndown trees, I'm not exactly sensitive\nto the ways of the wider world.
2	But I know the craftsmen in Torigoth\nturn the trees I fell into gorgeous pieces\nof furniture or musical instruments.
3	And the things they craft go on to\nmake all sorts of customers happy.
4	Isn't that enough, when it comes\nright down to it?
5	That's why no matter what happens,\nI'm just gonna stay right here, chopping\ndown these here trees.
tlk4170032101_ms.json
1	Well, what have we here! Been a while\nsince I last saw Drivers and Blades who\naren't in the Imperial Army.
2	Tell you what, I'll give you\na little tip for free.
3	A Driver's element is determined by\nthe Blade they happen to be using.
4	So if you're using a wind-element\nBlade, your attacks are going to be\nwind-element as well.
5	And certain elements are opposed\nto each other, as well.
6	For instance, if you use a fire-element\nBlade to attack a water-element\nmonster, you'll do more damage.
7	Switching between Blades based on\nthe enemy you're facing is a pretty\nimportant tactic.
tlk4170032103_ms.json
1	I'm the official representative\nof the Gormotti in Torigoth.\nThe Chief, if you like.
2	I always thought it was just a title,\nbut since that Dughall was removed\nfrom his post, I've had tons to do.
3	In the olden days, Chiefs like me would\nmeet together with the High Chief to\ndecide on all the affairs of Gormott...
4	But since we became a territory of\nMor Ardain, most of that governing\nbusiness has fallen to them.
5	Today's Gormotti people don't\nhave the know-how to run a proper\ngovernment of our own.
6	It's taking everything I have just to\nkeep this city's daily affairs in check.
7	I always thought we'd be better off\nwithout that no-good consul, but\nmaybe he had some skills after all...
tlk4170032104_ms.json
1	Part of my job lately has been posting\nflyers to the notice board.
2	We're understaffed, you see. I may be\nthe representative of the Gormotti, but\nI still have to pitch in with other tasks.
3	Have you been checking the\nnotice board flyers regularly?
4	When you do, spare a thought for\nthe guy who has to find time in his\nschedule to post 'em up there!
tlk4170032105_ms.json
1	After talking to the town elders,\nwe've decided to erect a memorial\nstatue for the people of Cordell.
2	To honor those who lost their lives in\nthe sudden attack, and to grant 'em\nhappiness in the next life.
3	The bandits have already been\nshipped back to Mor Ardain and\nlocked up, I hear.
4	On that note, we've also been\ndiscussing the matter of enforcing\nsecurity measures on Gormott.
5	Though my wish would be that no\nDriver of ill intent ever sets foot here\nagain...
tlk4170032106_ms.json
1	We're getting more and more\nrefugees from Mor Ardain.
2	Apparently Indol sank beneath the\nclouds, and Mor Ardain and Uraya have\nbeen flooded with refugees from there.
3	That influx has got some Ardainians\nwanting to jump ship to Gormott, since\nlife seems so much safer around here.
4	If you ask me, the Ardainians still have\nit pretty good compared to all those\nIndoline folk who lost their homes.
5	I could understand if it was people\nfrom Indol seeking refuge here, but\nwhen most of them are Ardainians...
6	If you ask me, they should learn to\ncope with a little inconvenience. Feels\nlike they're taking advantage of us.
7	I mean, I'm not going to turn 'em away.\nBut I doubt everyone's going to make\nthem feel very welcome.
tlk4170042101_ms.json
1	O fair Gormott, many are thy charms:\nSunlight like a mother's sweet caress,\nBranches stronger than a father's arms!
2	Oh, my apologies. I was merely\nexpressing my love for the natural\nbeauty of Gormott through poetry.
3	I wish only that the children in the city\nwould weave beautiful verses about\ntheir homeland also.
4	But alas, it seems they are all more\nconcerned with enjoying the present\nmoment than pursuing the literary arts.
tlk4170042102_ms.json
1	Now then, class, I want you to\nwrite a short descriptive piece on\nthe Leftherian landscape.
2	It needs to be evocative, so that anyone\nreading can immediately picture the\nscenery in their mind's eye.
3	Don't just describe what you see.\nRemember to use metaphor and\nsimile to express your feelings!
tlk4170042103_ms.json
1	Nebulous cloudy peaks...\nFor whom do you tower, looking\ndown from your lofty heights?
2	I'm trying to encapsulate my idea of\nthe Cloud Sea ridge through poetry,\nbut it's proving very difficult...
3	Ah, I do enjoy searching for new ways\nto express myself. Thank you so very\nmuch for having invited me here.
tlk4170042104_ms.json
1	Oh, Mor Ardain... Your indomitable\nflames... Your singular will, sharp as\na spearpoint...
2	I was writing poetry about Gormott\nuntil some soldiers ordered me instead\nto write about the glory of Mor Ardain...
3	They said they'd pay me if they\nliked it, so I'm putting everything\nI've got into it!
tlk4171014101_ms.json
1	Me and my grandad lost our homes.\nTech's all we've got left now, but we\nget by. Help us out, will you?

1	Right now we discussing among selves\nabout how to obtain merchandise\ncheaper and lower prices.
2	We think long and hard about how\nto help poor people living in Torika\nAlley...
3	Only conclusion we come to so far is\nto boost economy.
4	If everyone buy lots of products from\nus, that mean more demand.
5	Which mean in turn we get to produce\nmore, and price of goods go down.
6	So in short...
7	Purchase of more products help\ndevelop country, and as country\ndevelop, commodities get cheaper!
tlk4235014302_ms.json
1	We debating how to best increase\nproduct line-up of team.
2	It request from six noble houses, pride\nof Uraya, so have spent day and night\nstorming brain...
3	Frankly, there limit to new products we\nable to offer with domestic resources.
4	If want to make something new, need\nboth new resources and new ideas.
5	Quickest way to get that is relying\non other countries.
6	As country develops, economy grows,\nand that make it easier to negotiate\nbargains with other countries.
7	That give us access to new ideas and\nresources from rest of world.
8	Problem is, there guaranteed to be\nproblems with this approach, so must\nbe resolved.
9	That where Merc Group step in!\nMerc Group resolve problems\ncountries entrenched in.
10	What that mean is hiring you for tasks\nis necessity for welfare of country.
11	Kurolo wish friends best of luck!
tlk4235014303_ms.json
1	We discussing how Uraya was able to\ndevelop as country.
2	Uraya recently seen rapid growth\nin development of country thanks\nto certain someone.
3	We analyze from different angles and\nfind purchase of products not the only\nkey factor in growth of development.
4	First point is helping people in distress.
5	Solving of problems lead to brighter\nand more certain future. This factor\nnumber one.
6	Secondly, taking on requests.
7	Fulfilling mercenary requests mean\nimprovement of quality of life on\nboth personal and state level.
8	Next, talking with many people.
9	Communication on personal level\nseem to be main reason for effective\ninformation network.
10	And lastly, discovery of uncharted\nregions.
11	When new location discovered, news\nof discovery travel fast.
12	That give rise to new supply of\nresources, which supplement country\ngrowth.
13	...And that basically summarize reasons\nfor success of Uraya.
14	Whew... Long explanation make\nKurolo sleepy. Please not to ask\nKurolo to explain more...
tlk4235014304_ms.json
1	Uraya is seeing age of great\nprosperity...
2	Kurolo sad to say, but there nothing\nleft worth debating now.
3	Only remaining question would be how\nto develop country even further, but\ndiscussion not lead anywhere.
4	Well...Kurolo think it probably better\nif friends focus on development of\nother countries from now on.
5	Friends transformed Uraya into thriving\nmetropolis, and we thank you for that.

4	Was even more excited than Ookiooki.\nMaybe problem if tour guide herself get\ninjured.

1	Chocholo was on the roof gazing up\nat the stars when someone stepped\non Chocholo!
2	It hurt a lot... Felt like the shoe\nwas made out of metal.
3	So Chocholo asked a Mor Ardain\nsoldier to find the culprit!
4	The culprit maybe too strong for an\nordinary soldier, though... Maybe only\nLady Mòrag could really handle them.
tlk4242015102_ms.json
1	Chocholo wants to become a\nmerchant at a Nopon Guild when\nChocholo grows up!
2	There are eleven individual Guilds in\nthe Nopon Trade Guild family.
3	Biggest of all eleven is of course\nthe Argentum Guild.
4	Next biggest is the Voltis Trade Guild,\nand so on all the way down to the\nweakest Guild called Pyrithium.
5	Chocholo thinks Argentum Guild\nis probably the best to join.
6	But apparently it isn't that easy.\nFirst you have to make some kind of\nspecial coin as a symbol of the Guild?
7	Still, Chocholo will work hard\nto achieve this dream!
tlk4242015103_ms.json
1	Chocholo feels like the\nworld is ending...
2	Chocholo has never even left\nMor Ardain in whole life yet...\nCan't even speak proper Nopon!
3	How can it all be over so soon?!
4	What did us Nopon do to deserve this?!\nIt was all the Ardainians and Urayans\nand Indol people doing bad things!
tlk4242015104_ms.json
1	Do you know the new religious group\ncalled the Harbingers of Eschapon?
2	Chocholo finds their teachings\ndeeply inspiring!
3	Their ideas are exactly what us\nNopon need right now!
4	Huh? That cult went bust already?
5	Such a shame...
6	Chocholo thought even someone like\nme who can't speak proper Nopon\nmight find a home in their new world!
tlk4242016101_ms.json
1	Ouch-ouch...\nSulala hit her head again...
2	Maybe will only leave bump, but this\nnot really acceptable as tour guide.
3	Maybe time to look for new job once\nOokiooki leave from Ysheva Harbor.
4	Cleaning position at harbor here maybe\nan idea...
tlk4245011101_ms.json
1	This not Central Exchange.
2	This place for import and export\npaperwork of Ardainian traders.
3	Central Exchange is around center\nof this ship, Goldmouth.
4	If wanting to sell salvage goods,\nsuggest talk to Melolo.

1	Kokoi always seem to be falling\nin love with Drivers.
2	Drivers all very cool and collected,\nso heart of Kokoi go pitter-pat.
3	Kokoi want to make self very\nbeautiful by equip accessory...
4	Then buy Core Chips for\nlovely Driver...
5	Collect many collectibles for\nmake great Aux Core...
6	And stand by Driver through many\ntrial, watch Blade grow stronger!
7	Kokoi especially think...
8	Meh-meh?! Kokoi talk so long that lots\ncustomer arrive! Must go back to work!
tlk4245011103_ms.json
1	Kokoi has fallen in love with lots\nof Drivers in past.
2	But lately something bother Kokoi.
3	Some Driver have two or three Blade.
4	Some Driver even switch between\nBlades in battle with expert timing\nand keep attack going!
5	Some Driver even consider Blade\nelements, and use Driver Combo and\nBlade Combo, so no chance for enemy!
6	So Kokoi just think, if Kokoi marry\nDriver like that someday... When start\nfighting like all married couple...
7	Kokoi be at big disadvantage fighting\nagainst Driver and three Blade!
8	Terrifying thought!
9	Meh-meh?! Kokoi talk so long that lots\ncustomer arrive! Must go back to work!
tlk4245011104_ms.json
1	Kokoi have terrible habit of falling\nfor Drivers.
2	Heart of Kokoi skip beat now for\nso many Driver, started to notice\ninteresting pattern.
3	Brave Driver have trend of using\nfire and water Blades.
4	Compassionate Driver inclined to\nhave earth and electric Blades.
5	And honest Driver tend to use wind\nand ice Blades.
6	And lastly...
7	Meh?! Why you distract Kokoi like\nthis?! Need to get back to work! Long\nline of customer lining up!
tlk4245011105_ms.json
1	Maybe in bit of small big trouble...
2	Cargo ship that was on way to\nGoldmouth has run aground...
3	Trade people already come to pick up\nship itself...
4	But ship very smashed up all over.\nNot able to sail any more.
5	Maintenance team already busy\nworking on different ship, so have\nbig lack of manpower for repairs.

3	Thank very much for custom!\nWe has rooms free!
4	Was sleep pleasant?
5	Yep, slept like a log.
6	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Resting at an inn is so different from\nsleeping in that hut on Gramps' back...
7	I even feel like I've got a little stronger.
8	Right, time to head to the\nmeeting point!
9	It was at Goldmouth Exit Dock, right?

1	I'm doing lots of helping out.\nAll good training to become a Driver!
2	Once I'm a Driver, I'm gonna go visit\nall sorts of mercenary bands.
3	That way, I'll get to travel\nall over Alrest.
4	I'll do whatever it takes to find the guy\nwho got my mum and dad killed...
tlk4310014102_ms.json
1	Don't have to worry about me.\nI'm going to get so strong...
2	Yeah, I'll be grown up in no time. I'll be\na Driver with a cool Blade before you\nknow it.
tlk4310014103_ms.json
1	Hey, don't worry! You won't find him\nround here anymore. He's gone.
2	Never mind that anyway! My little\nsister's doing Grass-Smoked Salmon\nfor supper tonight!
3	I got some lovely Gormotti seasoning\nfrom one of those guys from the\nMerc Group.
4	It's a bit stronger than what my mum\nused, but it's good!
tlk4310014301_ms.json
1	I hope I get to go up\nthat tower one day.
2	Maybe I can if I can become a Driver,\nlike my dad. Yeah, maybe if I\nresonate with a Wind Blade...
3	But, I heard you also nead some\nspecial skill called Leaping or\nsomething...
4	I wonder if there's a Blade that can\ndo that... I'm sure I've never seen one\nthough!
5	Maybe if I resonate with a whole\nbunch of Blades, I'll find one someday.
6	I bet I'd need a strong heart to get\nmyself a great Blade like that, though.
tlk4310014302_ms.json
1	My dad's a mercenary. He does jobs\nall over Alrest.
2	When he goes somewhere, he usually\nbrings me back a Core Chip.
3	Some day I'll have a Blade of my own\nto give all my chips to!
4	But...Core Chips get used up once\nyou've used them, right?
5	So it's a bit of a waste if you just give\nthem abilities they've already got.
6	Best to give 'em one that'll improve\njust the one that you want.
tlk4310014303_ms.json
1	Temperantia got raided by the\nArdainian army! And my dad was there!
2	They had some really crazy Titan\nweaponry, he said!
3	I hope it'll turn out OK...
tlk4310014304_ms.json
1	Everyone who managed to get out of\nthe way of the Ardainian army is OK.\nBut my dad hasn't come back yet...
2	We haven't heard from him. So we\ndon't know if he's OK, or if he's been\nhurt...
3	I'll never forget what the Ardainians\ndid.
4	When I'm a Driver, I'm gonna fight for\njustice with a Light-type Blade! And I'll\nteach those Ardainians a thing or two!
5	Huh? Light-type Blades are hard to\nfind, you say?
6	But if I just set my mind to it, I'm\nsure I'll be able to resonate with a\nreally awesome one.

2	I'm from Torika Alley, me. We don't\nget a lot of toys round there.
3	Only real fun thing we get to enjoy\nis Mymoma Playhouse! It's just up\nthe stairs.
4	Kids can get in for free once a month\nin there!

tlk4310024602_ms.json
1	Thanks for the Nopon Chess Set!
2	Whenever I'm at home,\nI'm always playing it with that\nmate I told you about.
3	It's pretty well made. I bet it'll last a\nlifetime.
4	My mate's really smart though.\nSo I really gotta think about my\ntactics!
5	I gotta do my best to win. I feel like I'd\nbe letting him down as a friend if I\ndidn't!

1	We've been kinda hard up for stuff\nlately.
2	All we get to eat is Puran...
3	I tell you what, I'd love to eat a\nbucketload of that Blossom Custard.
4	I bet posh folks have a bucket of it\nfor every meal.
5	If I could catch a Speckled Whalefish,\nwell, I'd be rich, too!
6	That'd be the end of government\nrations for me!
7	But all I ever catch is Bipedal Crabs...
tlk4310034101_ms.json
1	My little brother Veero's such a\ncrybaby.
2	This one time, he tripped and skinned\nhis knee the tiniest bit, but he was\nbawling about it for hours!
3	I don't see how he's going to handle\nbeing an Urayan soldier...
4	The only thing he's good at is studying,\nreally. I'm kind of worried about him...
tlk4310034102_ms.json
1	Well, I heard this from my dad.
2	Last year, he was getting a Core Crystal\nshipment from Fonsa Myma port, but it\ngot stolen by this nasty pair of Blades.
3	Even the tough mercs they'd hired for\nprotection got bashed up. My dad got\ninjured too.
4	I bet they'd come at you too, if they\nthought you had some Core Crystals.\nBetter run if they do!
tlk4310034103_ms.json
1	Ah... Well I never...
2	I had no idea Praxis and Theory were\nsuch good eggs.
3	Sorry for running away\nlike that before...
4	I hope I'll get to eat some more of\ntheir Whelzaman Cookies at the next\nharvest festival!
tlk4310034201_ms.json
1	They say there are some monsters\nthat encourage their buddies to make\nthem stronger.
2	If I was in a fight like that, I reckon it'd\nbe best to take out the one that was\ndoing the encouragement first of all.
3	I heard that from one of my dad's\nDriver buddies.
4	You gotta study up if you wanna join\nthe Urayan army, y'know!
tlk4310034202_ms.json
1	So, when I grow up and join the\nUrayan army...
2	I'm gonna have to fight a Blade\nlike the ones my brother's talking\nabout, right?
3	Urggh... I don't stand a chance, do I?
4	I'd probably wee myself if a great big\nscary Blade like that appeared in front\nof me...
tlk4310034203_ms.json
1	Those Whelzaman Cookies were\nabsolutely bonzer!
2	I always wanted to join the Urayan\narmy. But now I'm thinking it'd be\npretty ace to be a Driver.
3	I dunno if I've got potential or not...\nBut I'm determined to try!
4	First thing I'll do when I get my Blade\nis get 'em to bake me up a batch of\nthose lovely cookies!
tlk4320014101_ms.json
1	I love Mymoma Playhouse, me. It's my\nfavorite theater.
2	I go every single day! Until my money\nruns out, I mean.
3	I hope I'll get to walk out on that\nstage someday as a leading lady!
4	I'd bring Cole's scripts to life! I'd make\nthem laugh! Make them cry!
tlk4320014102_ms.json
1	Did Iona really get kidnapped?
2	I'm glad to hear she's OK now. She\nlooked really sad when I saw her in\ntown though.
3	She looked kinda scared too.
4	But I reckon I'll be able to cheer her up\nif I take her out for a Rainbow Parfait,\nno worries!
tlk4320014103_ms.json
1	Iona's cheered up a bit now, I'd say.
2	She was giving herself a hard time, 'cos\nshe lost someone close, and blamed\nherself for it.
3	Nothing as bad as that has ever\nhappened to me, so it's tough for me\nto understand.
4	But, I still feel like I've got to\ndo everything I can to help\nher to get over it.
5	Eating loads of Blossom Custard\ntogether seems like a decent place\nto start.
tlk4320014104_ms.json
1	Cole's not been too healthy lately.
2	And I know Iona's been worrying\nabout it a lot.
3	Mymoma Playhouse is still running as\nusual, for now, anyway.
4	But I dunno how they'll keep it going\nwithout Cole.
5	I might never get my chance to step\nout on the stage!
tlk4320014105_ms.json
1	I heard the news. Apparently Cole's\nhealth has improved recently?
2	You sorted him out, didn't you?
3	Thanks!
4	Iona's looking better too. So maybe I\ndon't have to give up on my dreams of\nstardom!
5	I used to be scared of Blades, 'cos of\nhow they are in the Heroic Adventures\nof Addam. But they're nice really!
6	When I'm an actress playing a Blade,\nI'm going to make sure that I play them\nwith a bit of kindness!
7	Yeah, I can't wait!
tlk4320014201_ms.json
1	Hey! Listen up, you! You'd like to learn\nabout the skills a Blade needs when\nyou're out in the field, wouldn't you?
2	You want a Blade with useful skills\nlike Lockpicking or Keen Eye!\nNot many Blades like that, see!
3	If you find a Blade like that, never let\nit go, my lad!
4	That's what my old man's always\nsaying lately.
5	You need to cram as many factoids\nlike that into your brain as you can,\nif you wanna be a great Driver.
tlk4320014202_ms.json
1	Vandham said you could have his Merc\ngroup, but you're still a greenhorn,\naren'tcha?
2	If you've got a real thorny job, send out\na Blade with field skills that match the\ntask at hand! It'll get done a lot faster!
3	Choosing the right Blade for the job\ninstead of just sending out any old\ngoon - that's basic stuff, you know!
4	...That's what my dad says, anyway.
5	He's been in a real foul mood since\nVandham passed on.
tlk4320014203_ms.json
1	You ever pay any attention to how\ndeveloped countries are, do ya?
2	If a country gets a bit more developed,\nthere's a whole lot more jobs goin'\nfor Merc Groups!
3	Some o' those jobs might wind up\nmaking the traders have more stuff\nfor sale too, I dare say!
4	When you're doing a job, it's not just\na job! No! It's making the whole\ncountry better! Ever think of that!
5	That's my dad's latest lecture.
6	I gotta do everything I can to develop\nmy country and make the Merc Group\nstronger.
tlk4320014204_ms.json
1	Buy all the stuff in a shop, and you'll\nbe able to buy ownership rights!\nYou even know that, bonehead?
2	Once you're an owner, you get\nspecial bonuses for life!
3	But, even you know that going on\nMerc Missions increases the range of\nstuff you can buy at a shop, right?
4	Mind you don't forget it!
5	...Yep, that was another one of my\ndad's lectures. Real charmer, isn't he?
6	It can't be easy becoming a\nshop owner. But I'm sure you'll\nmanage it one day.

tlk4320014206_ms.json
1	Hey! Numbnuts! Listen to this!
2	Some of the Garfont ankle biters said\nthey saw a giant fish down at Farlaine\nWells!
3	I bet every merc group this side of\nAlrest'll be angling for that whopper!
4	We're the ones who found it, but\nat this rate some other bunch of\ndrongo mercs is going to get it!
5	Go on! Get off yer arse, catch that fish,\nand do us proud for a change!
6	...That's what my dad was saying\nthe other day.
7	Yeah, thanks!

1	Jelved's amazing for real!
2	My parents are gone too,\nbut I'd never considered\nharboring a grudge...

4	Ah, well, life here is fun enough for me.\nNo point in making a fuss, really.
tlk4320014302_ms.json

tlk4320014303_ms.json
1	Jelved? Oh, he's trying so hard!
2	With his sword lessons, and his other\nlessons... He's got no time to play\nanymore, that's how intense it is!
3	I'm afraid he'll get sick\nif he doesn't take it easy...
4	Maybe I'll ask him to come have\na picnic at Greatmaw Rapids?
5	If we get attacked by monsters or\nsomething, it'll be Jelved's chance\nto shine!

2	I've never actually seen it open,\nso I don't know what the view is like...

4	I bet you're curious, just like me!
tlk4320014402_ms.json
1	Look, look!\nThe Holy Gate of Fontana's open!
2	I've never seen that before!
3	They say that Olethro Ruins\nare somewhere on the other side...
4	but the stairs look soooo long!\nI don't think I'd be able to get\nto the top...
5	If you were gonna go,\nI hope you don't run outta steam!

1	Hey, d'you know where\nQueen Raqura's palace is?
2	It's above this Sevind Palace Plaza\nright here, duh! Oh, but regular folks\naren't allowed inside.
3	I've been keeping an eye on the\nwindows, hoping I might steal a peek\nat the Queen, but no dice.
4	Actually, I've not seen anyone at all!
5	Nobles of the six houses of Uraya\nare all soooo private...
tlk4320014404_ms.json
1	The Great Stairway behind the\nHoly Gate is cool, but so are the stairs\nthat lead downwards from the Plaza!
2	I hear they lead to a place called the\nRuins of Fountain Park. Ah, but I don't\nthink I could make it all the way...
3	You might be able to, if you could\njump a really long way... But for me,\nit'd spell broken bones for sure!
tlk4320014405_ms.json
1	I heard Queen Raqura's faaavorite\ngarden is down those stairs that start\non Sevind Palace Plaza.
2	I bet it's suuuuper pretty!\nOh, how I'd like to go one day!
3	But I can't picture Her Majesty jumping\nto get to the Ruins of Fountain Park...\nHow in the world does she get there?
4	Oh! Maybe there's a secret passage\nthat only the six noble houses can use!
tlk4330001101_ms.json
1	In the heat of battle, everything's\nabout location, location, location.
2	If you move round to your opponent's\nblind spot, it'll be much easier for\nyour attacks to connect.
3	My old man practically drilled that\ninto me. Used to be a merc, don'cha\nknow.
4	I really take after the guy,\ndon't you think? ...Well, actually\nI guess you wouldn't know!
5	Hah hah hah!
tlk4330001102_ms.json
1	Ever heard of Cunning Saggie?\nYou can find it out back in Uraya's\nMinnet Terrace.
2	That thing was clever enough to have\nmy old man's arm off in a fight. This\nwas back in his soldiering days.
3	In fact, that's where its name\ncomes from. They don't call it\ncunning for nothing!
4	You never know when you'll bump\ninto tough critters like that. Just\nwhatever you do, don't get too cocky.
5	Not unless you wanna end up in\nretirement like my old man.
tlk4330001103_ms.json
1	News travels fast. Everyone round here\nalready knows the Garfont mercs lost\ntheir leader.
2	He was a legend in his own right,\nto build up an elite squad like that\nall by himself.
3	My old man was always gushing with\npraise for the guy.
4	But now our shining star is gone.\nI thought that'd be the end of the\nGarfont mercs, but I was wrong.
5	Looks like a buncha kids carried on\nthe tradition, so they're still going\nstrong.
6	Still, it ain't gonna be easy keeping\nit all ticking, even with all the old\nworks in place.
7	You've gotta keep the squads busy,\nand build up experience and trust or\nthe whole thing'll fall flat on its face.
8	If they manage to actually pull it off\nthough? Then the mercs'll have\na bright future ahead of them.
tlk4330001104_ms.json
1	Never noticed before, but you guys\nhave a whole gaggle of Blades there,\ndon't ya?
2	If you've got any kicking about doing\nnothing, why not have them take on\na Merc Mission?
3	There's plenty of folks in town who'd\nappreciate a helping hand.
4	You'll get some form of reward\nand you'll net experience in the\nprocess. Worth it, no?
tlk4330001105_ms.json
1	You know how Blades and Drivers\ndevelop a relationship over time?
2	The more you fight and the more\nexperience you gain, the closer the\ntwo of you will become.
3	You'll probably be best buddies\nin no time at all. But see...
4	In reality, it goes much deeper\nthan that.
5	If you keep on fighting together,\nfor longer than you care to count...
6	then you'll create a bond deeper\nthan you ever thought possible!
7	Not that I've ever seen a Blade\nand Driver with such a deep\nconnection myself...
8	But it's what my old man told me,\nand I don't doubt his wisdom.

tlk4330004201_ms.json
1	Bahahaha!\nMy cooking is unparalleled!\nDon't miss your chance to have some!
2	Well, hey there, owner!\nCouldn't resist the lure of my\nunparalleled cooking? Bahahaha!
tlk4330004301_ms.json
1	My family, the Vayratis, we've been\nsmithin' in this town fer generations.\nI vouch personally for all my wares!
tlk4330004401_ms.json
1	Hey there, friends! I've got plenty of\nvintage cylinders for you! ...They're\nonly vintage because nobody's buying...
tlk4330004501_ms.json
1	Hello! This shop sells\nonly desserts of the highest quality.\nDon't eat them all at once!
2	Hello, dear owner! Please enjoy our\ndesserts - always the highest quality.\nDon't eat them all at once!
tlk4330004601_ms.json
1	Hey. I'm a prep cook.
2	That means I wash dishes,\npeel vegetables, that sorta thing.
3	Yeah, yeah. I know, OK?\nI'm only just starting out.
4	I was a mercenary till right recently.
5	I'd always launch the enemy in the air,\nthen smash them into the ground for\nmassive damage. I loved that combo.
6	...Ah, but now, my biggest dream is\nto become a cook at the court.
7	I like to imagine Queen Raqura\none day eating the food that I made!\nBut for now I gotta keep peeling.
tlk4330004602_ms.json
1	Damn that head cook...
2	Oh, so I'm not washing and peeling\nfast enough for him...? What a louse.
3	Gimme an axe instead of this\nparing knife and you'll see what\nI can do!
4	But I'm not about to throw in\nthe dishrag.
5	Not until the lovely Queen Raqura\nhas tasted my cooking...!
tlk4330004603_ms.json
1	...Well, whaddya know.\nThe head cook wasn't all talk...
2	I challenged 'em to a contest of\ndish-washing and veggie-peeling,\nbut they totally trounced me.
3	So then I challenged 'em to an\naxe contest...
4	But they won that too...
5	Our head cook isn't just a master chef,\nbut also a master combatant...
6	Seems like it'll be a good long while\nbefore the beautiful Queen Raqura\neats food that I've prepared...
tlk4330004604_ms.json
1	Because of that business in\nTemperantia, the store's gonna be\nclosed for a while...
2	I was looking forward to this\nseason as well...
3	This makes me really hate Ardainians.\nWhat's the point of 'em, really?
4	...Ah, no use grumbling.\nBetter spend this time training!
5	If I don't prove myself to the head\ncook, I can say goodbye to my dreams\nof joining the court kitchens!
tlk4330004605_ms.json
1	According to rumor, Queen Raqura\nate the Fire Dragons' cooking at the\nsummit in Indol...
2	What's worse, she supposedly called it\n"very fine"...
3	Man, I wonder what kind of meal the\nFire Dragons could have made...\nWhat I wouldn't give to try it...
4	After all, I need to know what I'm up\nagainst before I can come up with a\ndish to outshine them all!
tlk4330004606_ms.json
1	Whole months have passed since I\nquit the merc life to be a cook...but\nfinally the head cook approves of me!
2	I'm now permitted to make a real dish.
3	Namely, I'm in charge of\nthe Roast Meat Tagliata!
4	Now if I only knew how to make that...
tlk4330004607_ms.json
1	I've finally mastered the\nRoast Meat Tagliata!
2	I even got the head cook's\nseal of approval.
3	I knew I was on to something using my\naxe instead of the regular carving knife.\nAnd the plates I used were good, too.
4	Anyway, I'm one step closer to the day\nwhen I will finally be able to cook for\nthe esteemed Queen Raqura!
5	This is partly thanks to you, so\nwhy don't I teach you a recipe\nas a sign of my gratitude.
tlk4330004608_ms.json
1	While I was slaving to perfect my\nRoast Meat Tagliata, things have gone\ndownhill out there in the world...
2	I didn't realize at all.
3	I think I'd like to cook some food for\nthe refugees in Fonsa Myma, give them\nat least a little bit of joy.
4	Even though I only know how to make\nRoast Meat Tagliata...
5	Still, I can take pride in it, so long\nas the food serves a good purpose.
6	It can be my way of serving Queen\nRaqura for saving my hometown\nfrom the flood all those years ago.
tlk4330004609_ms.json
1	There's something on my mind.
2	Uraya is famous for its traditional\nhandcrafted crockery that's carved\nfrom shells and carapaces.
3	I quite like the thought of using them\nto serve the food I make, in the future.
4	I mean, isn't it great when the food\ncan boast both great taste and\npresentation?
5	Ah, but the dishes go up in price\nalong with the quality, so I don't\nthink they're within my range...
6	So I thought, why not make them\nmyself? But then, even as a cook\nI've got a long way to go, so...
7	Seriously?\nWow, that'd be a massive help!
8	I hope you can make it a good one!
tlk4330004801_ms.json
1	Nice of you to drop by!\nGot anything nice and rare?\nI'll give you a good price!
2	At the risk of sounding arrogant,\nI'm a bit of an antique myself,\nso I can judge!
tlk4330004901_ms.json
1	Hey, you're back!\nFeel free to take it easy.
tlk4330006101_ms.json
1	Heyah. You're tourists, too?\nMe and my family are also traveling.\nWe spent a few days chilling in Fonsett.
2	But now, ah... The time we've spent\nwaiting for a boat is longer than our\noriginal holiday. Crazy, right?
3	They told us that a boat bound for\nMor Ardain should soon be leaving\nfrom Rigitte Harbor, but...
4	I don't really see me taking my\nwhole family across that ridge\nin the Cloud Sea...
5	Not to mention, us Urayans going\nto Mor Ardain might get a bit hairy\nin its own right...
tlk4330006102_ms.json
1	I hear that a boy from Fonsett has\nestablished a direct trade route\nto Argentum.
2	That's great news for us! Just great!\nIt means we'll finally be able to get\nback home to Uraya.
3	...On the other hand, my wife's made\nsome friends here in Fonsett, and she's\nbeen learning local cooking, too...
4	Said she won't go back till she knows\nthem all, so I've just been watching the\nboats go by... At least she's having fun.
tlk4330014501_ms.json
1	Hey again! My curiosity got the better\nof me, so I went over to the Great\nStairway myself to see what was up.
2	I found that Ardainian, but he\nwas all beat up on the ground!\nSo I took him to a doctor.
3	No need to thank me. I wouldn't leave\nanyone high and dry like that, not even\nan Ardainian.
tlk4330014601_ms.json
1	Gorg's shop is tended by the\ndaughter of the Gaselart family.
2	It would normally be unthinkable to\nhave the daughter of a noble house\nworking in a shop, but...
3	It seems like the lady herself has\ntaken a liking to Gorg's desserts...
4	She begged to be allowed to work\nthere, so even I was swayed by\nher zeal.
5	I'm really happy Gorg's shop,\nJust Desserts, has come to fruition.
6	Now with the girl's help, it seems\nlikely business will further improve,\nso we'll be counting on your support!
tlk4330014801_ms.json
1	The Whelzaman Cookie strategy\nseems to have gone swimmingly.
2	Not just the kids, but also their\nparents are grateful to you.
3	With this, I don't think there's anyone\nleft in Fonsa Myma who'd be afraid\nof the Blades with eyepatches!
4	Looks like Theory and Praxis finally\nhave a Driver who's a good sort.
5	Keep up the good work!
tlk4330024101_ms.json
1	Fonsa Myma is a capital of the arts.
2	Even a no-name landscape artist\nlike me, working day in and day out\nwith no sales, can find some respect.
3	My worries now are of a different kind...\nYou see, the distribution center has\nsprung up in this square...
4	It wasn't there when I'd started\npainting the scene...
5	It won't be long before war with\nMor Ardain breaks out... I can feel it.
tlk4330024102_ms.json
1	I've passed near Mor Ardain before.
2	I'm just a nobody in the noble houses,\nbut I still got to travel a little bit with\nmy parents.
3	Mor Ardain's Titan was starting to\ndeteriorate even back then.
4	As is usual for Titans at the end of\ntheir lifespan, the surface temperature\nwas rising, withering the plants...
5	Nobody'd want to live\nin a place like that.
6	Truly, Uraya's Titan is the place to be.
tlk4330024103_ms.json
1	The state of the world keeps changing.
2	Seeing the lives of the commoners from\nhere, and painting the scenes I see,\nI think I can understand it clearly.
3	Unlike my father, who's involved in the\ngovernment, or the other nobles...
4	Oh, they can talk about the Ardainian\ntreaty, or the reparations, for days...
5	But they don't hear the word on\nthe street like I do.
tlk4330024104_ms.json
1	Refugees from Indol have landed\nnot far from Gwendle Repair Dock.
2	That's Urayan hospitality for you.\nWe're all floored by Queen Raqura's\nbenevolence.
3	The people of Fonsa Myma have also\naccepted them, getting ready for a life\nbuilt side by side.
4	Like the distribution center.\nThe sight moves me every time.\nI want to immortalize it in my art.
5	But in the middle of all that, there\nare noble sons who... Ah, pardon me.\nI was about to commit slander there!
tlk4330024106_ms.json
1	Ohhh, why now?!
2	I don't know what to do!\nNow I can't finish my painting!
3	Please listen!
4	I am but a humble painter,\nbut I received a decidedly\nextravagant request!
5	They want me to paint a new portrait\nof Queen Raqura each month!
6	Now, this was my first time, so\nobviously I wanted to put my\nbest foot forward, but...
7	I've run out of pigment for the painting!
8	In putting my best foot forward,\nI must've laid the paint on too thick.
9	And now I don't even have enough\nTricolor Rock left to make more...
10	If I don't come up with something\nquick, I'm going to blow the deadline!
11	Oh! I thank you for your kind words!
12	Please, don't let me down!
tlk4331014101_ms.json
1	Don't you think Titan battleships are\nwonderful? There's something so\ninspiring about their majestic forms.
2	The reason I joined the maintenance\ncorps was so I'd get to see all the\ndetailed workings of ships like this.
3	Urayan battleships make the most\nof the Titan's natural features.\nIt's a key design philosophy.
4	With ships like that, maintenance is all\nabout keeping the Titan healthy and\nlooking after the organic nanotubes.
5	I feel a little bad for the weaponized\nTitans though. When war breaks out,\nthey get sent to the frontlines.
6	Breaks my heart when they come back\nand they're all smashed up. It really\ngets me.
tlk4331014102_ms.json
1	Maintenance is complete. This one's\nready to head out into battle already.
2	Just waiting for the order now.
3	But to be honest, I'd rather we didn't\ngo to war with Mor Ardain.
tlk4331014103_ms.json
1	The Ardainians came at us without\neven the slightest warning. That's\npretty low, even for them.
2	Half of the Titan battleships and their\ncrews won't make it back from\nTemperantia.
3	Ah, it's a shame it came to this. It's\nprobably too late even to get out of\nthe way of the war now.
4	Those Ardainians are going to find out\nthe hard way the costs of messing with\nus, you can count on that.
tlk4331014104_ms.json
1	I'm still not really sure Queen Raqura\nmade the right decision there.
2	I reckon it was Torna who attacked us\nwith that Judician Titan weapon.
3	It was the Ardainians who brought it\nback to life though, huh?
4	If they'd have left it in the ground,\nthen Torna'd never have gotten their\nhands on it.
5	Those Ardainian scum are just trying\nto shift the blame over to Torna. We\nshouldn't stand for it!
tlk4331014105_ms.json
1	These Titans are packing\nsome awesome power.\nBut it has its limits.
2	If there are many more clashes like that\nbetween Uraya and Mor Ardain...well...
3	...all their power will be spent. And\nthat'll be it for this country.
4	We think of Mor Ardain as the enemy.\nBut if the Titan goes down, then a\nwhole lot of people are going to die.
5	That's not something I\nreally like to think about.
6	We should've tried to sort this out\nwhen we still had time to do it.
tlk4331014201_ms.json
1	These are the barracks for the\nUrayan Army.
2	Are you looking to join up?
3	No...from the looks of you,\nI'll wager you're mercenaries.
4	Must be tough, having to worry\nabout keeping your Blades\nhappy all the time.
5	I hear you can't even rely on their\nsupport in battle if you don't\naccommodate them enough.
6	If a Blade's power can't even be relied\nupon, wouldn't a properly-trained\nsoldier make a better partner?
tlk4331014202_ms.json
1	The gate leading to the Olethro Ruins,\nthe Holy Gate of Fontana, has been\nforced open.
2	Some sources claim it was the work\nof Torna, but there's no trace of them\nto be found, so it's difficult to say.
3	We also found some severe damage\nto the Olethro Ruins themselves.
4	Some people are even saying they saw\nthe Aegis around. We'll have to boost\nFonsa Myma's security, that's for sure...
5	If you see anyone suspicious, be sure\nto report them to the Urayan Army.
tlk4331014203_ms.json
1	It's a shame we didn't get to wipe out\nthose damn Ardainians.
2	Our armor is made from the hardened\nexcretions of the Urayan Titan, referred\nto in common parlance as "coral".
3	It's strong enough to withstand even\na blast from Mor Ardain's most\npowerful weapon, Archelon.
4	I would have relished the chance to\nprove once and for all that our soldiers\nare categorically superior to theirs.
tlk4331014204_ms.json
1	Have you ever faced Indoline\nwarrior monks in combat?
2	I always thought they'd be pushovers,\nsince they grew up in the peace-loving\nland of Indol, but apparently not?
3	I dunno, the ones I've seen patrolling\nthe Sanctum didn't strike me as very\nscary-looking.
4	'Course, Indoline folk are pretty lanky\nin general, so you'd think their weapons\nwould be too heavy for them.
5	Are these monks even Indoline at all?
6	Could they secretly be training up\nrefugees from Uraya or Gormott,\nor even Mor Ardain?
tlk4331014801_ms.json
1	Nice. A Driver and a Blade.
2	So. What's your class?
3	A Driver's characteristics are affected\nby their Blades or, strictly speaking,\nthe weapons the Blades have, y'know.
4	If you've got, say, two with Megalances\nby your side, that gives you the class\nof Elite Fighter.
5	Or if you've got one with a Bitball and\none with a Shield Hammer, then you're\na Knight.
6	A good Driver tries out all kinds of\ndifferent combinations and figures out\nwhat works best with what.
tlk4331014802_ms.json
1	Which flamin' mongrel bust open the\nHoly Gate of Fontana?
2	They built these massive gates so\nthey'd even stand up to full-frontal\nassaults from Blades.
3	It had to be pretty tough. It's to\nstop the Cloud Sea flooding in when\nthe Titan makes a dive, y'see.
4	Whoever smashed it open must have\nhad some pretty awesome power at\ntheir command, I tell you.
tlk4331014803_ms.json
1	Go down that stairway and it'll\ntake you to Fonsa Myma Port.
2	Sometimes the Titan dives into the sea.\nWhen it does, you can't open the doors.\nSo, naturally, you can't leave.
3	But, luckily, that's not the case\nright now. So we can come and go\nas we please.
4	You could take a boat over to another\nTitan, no bother.
5	'Course, you've no hope of going\ndirect to Mor Ardain. We cut ties with\n'em when it all kicked off, see.
tlk4331014804_ms.json
1	Queen Raqura's kinda mellowed\nout a bit. Not sure if I like it.
2	I was pretty shocked that she accepted\nthat ceasefire from the Ardainians.
3	Torna may have been up to no good,\nbut it was still the Ardainians who dug\nup that Judician Titan weapon.
4	It was their fault. I dunno how we can\njust let them off the hook like that?
5	Maybe it's 'cos that Ardainian Blade\nsaved the Queen.
6	But I can't help wondering if the\nArdainians didn't cook up that\nlittle drama themselves...
7	It bugs me, is all...
tlk4331014805_ms.json
1	Never thought I'd live to see the day\nwhen Uraya and Mor Ardain had to\njoin forces to survive.
2	Till now, Uraya and the Ardainians have\nonly been lookin' out for number one.
3	I guess your way of thinking changes\nwhen the fate of the whole of Alrest\nis at stake though.
4	But I mean...maybe it's a good thing.

1	War with Mor Ardain could easily\nbreak out at any time.
2	That's why we're stocking up the\nTitan battleship with food rations.
3	If the Empire make a move to expand\ntheir territory, only Uraya will be able\nto stop them!
4	So we must always be on our guard,\nfor the sake of other nations as well.
tlk4331019102_ms.json
1	Have you heard of Temperantia?
2	Uraya and Mor Ardain are in close\nproximity around this period, and\nTemperantia is slap bang in the middle.
3	It's established as a buffer zone\nwhere all combat is prohibited.
4	But both sides station forces there\nin case something does break out.
5	That's why we're stocking this ship up\nwith rations and soldiers and heading\nto Temperantia right now.
tlk4331019103_ms.json
1	The Temperantia incident just\nconfirmed all my worst suspicions\nabout those accursed Ardainians.
2	I mean, they were secretly excavating\nJudicium Titan weaponry in the middle\nof designated neutral territory!
3	That Titan weapon that wiped out\nour forces stationed in Temperantia\nwas powerful to be sure...
4	But did we really do the right thing\nagreeing to Indol's calls for a ceasefire?
5	Did those who fell perish for nothing?
tlk4331019104_ms.json
1	We loaded this Titan battleship\nwith rations in preparation for\nwar with Mor Ardain.
2	But now we're using those rations\nthat were intended to be used for war\nto feed the refugees instead.
3	We all have to work together to\nmake it through these trying times.
tlk4332014201_ms.json
1	After the stuff that happened, we\ndecided not to let the kids go out\nto play without a grown-up on hand.
2	I thought the kids would kick up a\nfuss 'cos we'd be cramping their style.
3	But, actually, they're stoked. They get\nto see the Mercs at work, and it's a\nreal buzz for them.
4	Gotta watch that Jelved though.
5	I can't shake the feeling he's bound\nto get himself into trouble.
tlk4332014202_ms.json
1	The kids are playing at\nbeing Mercs again.
2	Seems like they're getting pretty good\nat all the details of handling weapons\ntoo now.
3	Especially that Jelved...
4	He always had a bit of a spark,\nbut it's really showing now.
5	I hope it doesn't get him into trouble\nsomeday...
tlk4332014203_ms.json
1	Jelved never lets up.
2	You can't take your eye\noff him for a second.
3	It's a lot for a nipper to take on board,\nwhat happened with Nicc, and his\nparents. But he'll get over it someday.
4	To be honest, I'm not sure if he\nreally understands what his folks\nare going through right now.
tlk4332024201_ms.json
1	Hey. I heard it from the big man.\nYou're a rookie Driver, aincha?
2	Anyone can see you're a rookie. But\nyou're still a leader, kid. That means\neveryone's depending on you.
3	I got a piece of advice for you.
4	Party leader's the one who gets to\ncall the shots with the Blade Combos.
5	And if you chain up those combos,\nyou'll get a little boost of power each\ntime.
6	When you're the leader, the buck stops\nwith you. So make sure you're giving\nthe right orders.
7	I doubt I've got much to teach you.
8	You should just get out there and do\nyour best to be good example to all\nthe greenhorns out there.
tlk4332024202_ms.json
1	A rookie leader, eh... You really gotta\nnail down the basics of battle, then.
2	If the enemy get the drop on you when\nyou don't have your weapons drawn,\nyou're gonna take a lot of damage.
3	You wanna be battle-ready. Otherwise,\nyou'll get bashed up.
4	Then you want to watch\nout for the ugly mugs out\nthere that get into a rage.
5	If they're all worked up, then things\nare gonna be different. So you need to\nbe on your guard!
tlk4332024203_ms.json
1	That request I took earlier... I just\ncouldn't do it.
2	There's some monsters that give extra\nstrength to their buddies if they stay\nclose to them in battle.
3	If you run into a monster like that,\nyou need to take out the one that's\nsupporting the others first off.
tlk4332024204_ms.json
1	You heard about this?
2	I've never been out to Temperantia\nmyself, so I dunno if this is true, but...
3	I heard they got some crazy-strong\nmonster called Tyrannotitan Kurodil\nsealed away over there.
4	About 300 years ago, a coupla hundred\nIce-type Blades teamed up and put the\nseal on him, they say.
5	I heard they got loads of nasty\nmonsters like that over there.
6	There's no people living there.\nIt's a desolate place.
7	Probably 'cos of all the monsters,\nI'll bet.
tlk4332024206_ms.json
1	Oh! You showed up at just the right\ntime!
2	You already know that the Urayan\nTitan swallows down stuff from the\noutside now and again, right?
3	I mean, you should know. You're some\nof the stuff it swallowed, aincha?
4	That's exactly what I wanted to ask\nyou about.
5	I need you to go check if\nanything dangerous washed\nup with all that junk.
6	OK!
7	If you do find something dodgy, don't\ntouch it. It might be hazardous.
8	Just let me know about it if you find\nsome.
tlk4332034101_ms.json
1	My, you have an awful lot of Blades\nwith you, don't you?
2	Looks like your weapon skills are a bit\nbasic right now though, am I right?
3	If you stick with the same weapon\nthroughout a lot of battles, then your\nskill with it is sure to grow!
4	I'm sure it'll make your Arts a lot\nstronger, too.
5	So don't forget to always think about\neach Blade's weapon class when you're\nchoosing a partner!
tlk4332034102_ms.json
1	A few members of Torna showed up\nin this town a little while ago.
2	I was thinking of trying to arrest them\nmyself. But it was just me, so I didn't\nhave a hope.
3	Looks like they're mobile enough to\nappear anywhere they like though.
4	They've got a really smart ship, that's\nfor sure. It's not made out of a Titan,\neither.
5	It looked like a thing from another era,\nif you ask me...Something using some\nkind of forgotten technology.
tlk4332034103_ms.json
1	Urayan Drivers are pretty much the\nsame as any other Drivers.
2	We use Core Crystals that have been\ncleansed over in Indol.
3	That's what I did. There's still a lot\nof people who can't resonate with\nthe raw crystals, you see.
4	But if you really want to pack a punch\non the battlefield, you've gotta be a\nDriver.
5	That's how it is here, and everywhere\nelse.
6	So we don't have much choice but to\nrely on Indol for cleansing.
7	And this is the source of\nIndol's mighty strength!
tlk4332034104_ms.json
1	I hear Indol has fallen.
2	I don't have much sympathy for them,\nsince they led us astray and tried\nto bring us low.
3	But it's also thanks to them\nthat we have so many Drivers\naround these days.
4	So future generations will\nhave to get used to having\na lot less Drivers around.
5	And the Ardainians will have a major\nadvantage, with all their Titan\nweaponry, too.
6	Well, for as long as their Titan stays\nalive, that is.
tlk4340001101_ms.json
1	Hello there! Take your time,\nhave a look around!
2	I don't think I should be wasting time\nright now...
3	I'm so glad I found an owner like you.\nIt's not easy for non-Nopon merchants\nto run a business around here!
tlk4340001201_ms.json
1	What am I doing?
2	Nothing much. Just a little...\npeople watching.
3	I'm an Urayan.
4	Need I say more?
tlk4340001202_ms.json
1	Drivers can borrow the power of their\nBlades even outside of battle.
2	They can open locks for you, leap\ngreat distances...
3	If there's something you can't do,\nwell, maybe your Blade can.
4	My life would be a whole lot easier\nif I were a Driver...
5	It's hard enough as it is keeping tabs\non Bana's movements right now.
6	He's definitely planning something,\nI just know it...
tlk4340001203_ms.json
1	I knew the Special Distribution Audit\nBureau had made a move, but I never\nthought they'd beat me to the punch.
2	That Niranira bloke's really got his\nhead screwed on.
3	If only he hadn't sold out to Mor\nArdain, we'd have got our hands\non our slippery little chairman...
4	In any case, I'll have to report back\nto Uraya.
5	Will it really be over, though? Will the\ncorruption really end with Bana?
tlk4340001204_ms.json
1	The Ardainian army had Bana, but now\nwe don't know where he's got to.
2	He hasn't returned to Goldmouth.\nI hope he's not plotting something...
3	What worries me is how he managed\nto escape.
4	Is there someone else behind the\nscenes orchestrating all this?
5	I can't exactly get a clear grasp of the\nsituation from here...
tlk4340001205_ms.json
1	Well, this certainly is a problem...
2	Cases of merchant vessels being\nattacked in the night and dragged\ninto the sea are on the rise.
3	Now, according to the reports...
4	they say deep-sea Serprond are\nresponsible for the incidents.
5	Ordinary men like us wouldn't stand\na chance against them, it seems.
6	But perhaps Drivers like you could set\nthem straight...
7	Thanks. I was hoping you'd say that.
8	Here's hoping you can teach those\nSerprond a lesson.
tlk4340001206_ms.json
1	That damn Bana! We never would have\nthought he was targeting Queen Raqura\nof all people...
2	But I have to say, it's unexpected that\nthe Emperor of Mor Ardain would\nintervene to lend us a hand.
3	I hear you offered us your\nassistance too.
4	Well, you have my thanks.
5	Up until now, I'd been launching a\nsecret investigation into the actions\nof the Nopon and of Mor Ardain.
6	But fighting a common enemy has\ndefused Urayan-Ardainian tensions.\nFor now, I think my job here is done.
tlk4340001207_ms.json
1	If you'd told me Bana's father was\npuppeteering the whole affair, I'd\nnever have believed it.
2	He was supposed to have retired long\nago. And yet he had built up an entire\nsyndicate in secret...
3	We didn't have the slightest inkling,\nand I doubt Mor Ardain did either.
4	If it hadn't been for your decisive\nactions, we'd never have been able\nto pin the Don down.
5	You ought to be awarded special\nmerit for that!
tlk4340004101_ms.json
1	My fish dishes are so delicious just the\nthought of them will make you drool!
2	Howdy, owner! Here for some more\nof my face-meltingly delicious\nfish dishes?

1	Welcome! Use our makeup to put on\nyour game face! You'll find your perfect\ncatch in no time!
2	Lovely to see you, owner! Hmm...you're\nlooking a little plain today, for someone\nwho buys so much of our makeup.

1	Welcome!\nLooking for help with your Aux Cores?
tlk4340004401_ms.json
1	Why hello!\nYou're most welcome here.
tlk4340004402_ms.json
1	Well if it isn't Vandham!\nIt's been a while.
2	Today's stay's on the house, for\nold time's sake. Now get yourselves\nsome rest!
3	Make yourselves at home.
4	Off for a wander?\nWell, come back whenever you're done.
5	Rest here?
6	Yes
7	No
tlk4340004403_ms.json
1	You lot need to get yourself off\nand help Iona.
2	Still not feeling up to scratch? Well,\nyou'd be better off getting some rest...
3	Once you're up to it, get out there and\nhelp Iona out sharpish!
4	The Olethro Ruins are at the very top\nof the Holy Gate of Fontana.
5	Hey! This is a business.\nI can't let you stay for free. Sorry...
tlk4340004404_ms.json
1	They say that the good die young.\nAnd it's completely true...
2	Need some rest before you head\noff again? You're most welcome.
tlk4340004501_ms.json
1	Welcome!\nHow about some Champ's Churros\nfor your theater friend?
tlk4340004601_ms.json
1	The trust you have between Blade\nand Driver...isn't bad at all!
2	I know, 'cos my dad has a merc\ngroup, so it's something I've seen often.
3	During a battle, a Driver's inner\nstrength grows.
4	And at the same time, the Blade's bond\nof trust with the Driver deepens.
5	You both gain something by heading\nout onto the field of battle together.
tlk4340004602_ms.json
1	My dad runs the Viltsbine Mercs.
2	They have some real roughnecks but\nthey know how to handle themselves.
3	The Garfont Mercenaries? Yeah, heard\nthey just lost their leader.
4	They were good at what they did, so\nI'm just glad we've one less competitor.
5	Now's the time to move in for some\nacquisitions... I should really put my\ndad up to that...
tlk4340004603_ms.json
1	Most Urayan noble houses have their\nown mercenary forces.
2	I told my dad we should acquire the\nGarfont Mercenaries...\nBut we were already too late.
3	Seems like they're having success\nunder a new leader...
4	I think it's scandalous that someone\nnot from a noble house should have a\nmercenary force...
5	But it's not illegal. So I suppose not\nreally much can be done about it.
tlk4340004604_ms.json
1	The Garfont Mercenaries... I'll say this,\nthey really know their trade.
2	Dad's Viltsbine Mercs mainly operate\nin Uraya...occasionally in Argentum too.
3	But the Garfont lot don't recognize\nborders. They go wherever they're\nneeded.
4	Not only that but they take on any\nmission, no matter how tough or how\npoorly rewarded.
5	All in all, they're just model mercs.
6	Course...if they did it for nothing,\nit'd be even more impressive.
tlk4340004701_ms.json
1	Come closer...\nHave a good look around.
2	Come on in, owner!\nHave a good look around.
tlk4340004801_ms.json
1	Take your time. Well, I suppose\nanything would look good on you.
tlk4340008101_ms.json
1	Thought I'd come and have a look at\nthe prince of Tantal! I'm waiting for\nhim to show up.
2	Ah! You're the ones who helped me out\nwhen I was frozen... Thanks for that.\nIt was quite an embarrassing situation.
3	Apparently, the prince is off, trying\nwith all his might to save Alrest!
4	I bet he looks super cool doing it...\nI hope he comes back soon so I can\nsee him...

1	Welcome, welcome.\nThis patisserie is run by the famed\ncake-maker Gorg.
2	We have many luxurious items for your\ndelectation. All of them guaranteed to\nsate your culinary desires.
tlk4340044101_ms.json
1	Don't see a lot of Ardainians\non the streets of Uraya, do you?
2	My husband's an Urayan. He\nworks as a mercenary.
3	My dad's in the mercenary business\ntoo, so that's how we originally met...
4	He tells me about his fights every day.
5	Some enemies can only defend in\ncertain directions. To the front only, or\nthe front and sides...
6	His stories get a bit bloody, but I've got\na strong stomach, so we get on well.
tlk4340044102_ms.json
1	I see...\nSo my father, he...
2	Now that I'm married to an Urayan,\nI don't get back to Torigoth often.
3	But, I think I'll go and have a look\nat the old house sooner or later.
4	He must have entrusted those golden\nbracers to you because he knew he\nhadn't long left.
tlk4340044103_ms.json
1	Hello...\nHow are you all doing?
2	I've been using Gromrice lately to\nmake some dumplings to give to the\nkids, just like Vess used to do for me.
3	They've turned out pretty good, so\nthe kids pester me every day for them.
4	I'll end up looking like a dumpling at\nthis rate if I don't make something else.
tlk4340044301_ms.json
1	I'm asking for rations again today.
2	Because of the war, the Urayan Army\nis restricting sales of food and things\nare getting more and more expensive.
3	I just can't get vegetables like I used to.
4	But it's all going toward Uraya's\nvictory in the war.
5	And there's lots of people working\nas soldiers and mercenaries in\nFonsa Myma...
6	That includes lots of people I know.\nWe all have to do our bit.
tlk4340044302_ms.json
1	War with Mor Ardain's been avoided.
2	So why is the Urayan Army still\nhoarding food?
3	Are they still planning on war with\nMor Ardain?
4	Will we have to survive on rations\nfor ever?
tlk4340044303_ms.json
1	No, I'm not all right.
2	You know there are all these refugees\nfrom Indol now, right?
3	Well, thanks to them, our rations\nhave gotten smaller than ever.
4	How am I supposed to feed my\nchildren on this?
5	I mean, I know they're victims too...\nBut if we keep on like this, everyone's\ngoing to suffer - us and them!
6	The bigwigs need to stop thinking\nabout their own interests and start\nputting the country first...
tlk4340044304_ms.json
1	Since the refugees from Indol arrived\nlife's been pretty tough...
2	But things have gotten a bit better\nthanks to you and your friends.
3	It should have been the nobles' job\nto sort it all out... But you picked\nup the slack when they failed us.
4	Thank you for your help. Me, my\nchildren...we're all ever so grateful.
tlk4340054101_ms.json
1	This paddy's for growing Gromrice.
2	Gromrice is the Urayans' staple food.\nIt's cultivated enthusiastically in the\ncapital, Fonsa Myma.
3	The interesting thing is, its name\nchanges depending on how you cook it.
4	If you knead it and finely chop it,\nthat's called Fidel, or you can flatten\nit out, then it's a Glarna.
5	To think I'm supporting Urayan food\nculture gives me such a buzz!
tlk4340054102_ms.json
1	As you can see, Uraya is a land filled\nwith plenty of water and greenery.
2	Thanks to this, we also have plenty of\nfood. We will not be beaten by any\nother country.
3	Even if we were to get into a war with\nMor Ardain, we would not struggle for\nfood.
4	If it became a war of attrition, without\ndoubt, victory would be Uraya's.
5	It's only right the military continues\nto regulate the Gromrice rations.
tlk4340054103_ms.json
1	You know the Old Quarry?\nIt's off to the left if you go through\nthe Stone Gate Ruins from here.
2	Some terrible monsters have made\ntheir lair up there.
3	We're always discussing whether we\nshould leave it to the monsters or try\nand claim it back.
4	Queen Raqura prefers the status quo\nit seems.
5	If we could get it back, we could start\nquarrying again, so Fonsa Myma could\nflourish...
6	But maybe the queen's right and the\nsacrifices would be too great...
tlk4340054104_ms.json
1	The water in the paddies seems\na bit odd.
2	Is it because we used the power of the\nUraya Titan, maybe?
3	It'll probably get back to normal soon...\nBut I fear the next Gromrice crop will\nbe spoiled.
4	The sooner it's right again, the better...
tlk4340054106_ms.json
1	It's just as I thought...\nWe're not going to get much\nfurther without outside help...
2	Uraya prospers from its Gromrice\nproduction, as I'm sure you know.
3	That's why we're ploughing on with\nour Gromrice research, night and day.
4	But recently we've been making poor\nprogress and have ground to a halt.
5	That's why we're on the lookout for\nsome plant experts. Driver, Blade,\nNopon, it doesn't matter.
6	If you find anyone suitable, could you\nsend them our way?
7	Thanks, that's a big help.
8	Looking forward to next time.
tlk4340054201_ms.json
1	Welcome!
2	This is the best restaurant in Fonsa\nMyma, if I do say so myself.
3	...Well, we get some drongos in here,\nso it's more of a pub than anything...
4	There are lots of places like this in\nFonsa Myma.
5	All the mercs who get off duty come in\nto eat and booze, and just have a laugh\nand let their hair down.
6	Also gives them a chance to talk about\ntheir next assignments.
7	Well, hope you fit in here.
tlk4340054202_ms.json
1	There's something I never knew.
2	If a Core Crystal remains intact, you\ncan bond with it again.
3	Apparently, the Blade loses its\nmemories, but looks exactly the same.
4	But you can't do it straight away.
5	You have to wait until the crystal's\nreturned to its normal color.
tlk4340054203_ms.json
1	I heard something interesting.
2	Chairman Bana over in Argentum has\nfallen from grace of late.
3	Rumors of some dodgy backhand\ndealings.
4	They also say he managed to become\nchairman via family connections...
5	Bet he's managed to make a mint\non his dirty money...
6	More than I could ever make working\nin this place.
7	Who says crime doesn't pay?
tlk4340054204_ms.json
1	If you've come looking for good news,\nyou're dang out of luck.
2	All the countries' Titans are battered\nand ragged with the fighting...
3	And with all the people that escaped \nfrom Indol, our tempers are fraying \ntoo...
4	I wish I could say I saw a silver\nlining to this cloud, but I can't.\nNot in good conscience, anyway.
5	It may sound rough, but all we can do\nis try to wait it out. These are trying\ntimes, for sure.
6	At least when they eat at our restaurant\nthe people can relax a smidgen.
tlk4342014201_ms.json
1	I always thought that Damida\nwas a no good type!
2	Nopon prefer eating and playing\nto working any day of the week.
3	It was a bit suspicious for him to be\nputting so much effort into working for\nthe group.
4	On the other hand, selling people out\njust for a few G is such a Nopon thing\nto do.
tlk4342014501_ms.json
1	Such a great play...\nSo sad...but uplifting too.
2	They've been performing the Heroic\nAdventures of Addam ever since I was\na child, you know.
3	It's amazing that we keep a tale from\n500 years ago going like we do.
tlk4342014502_ms.json
1	You're saying the leader of the Garfont\nMercenaries is dead?
2	I'm a mercenary, so I knew Vandham.
3	When I was a newbie we went out on\na mission to subjugate Ignas together.\nHe gave me some good advice.
4	Like, "Some enemies are immune to\nDriver Combos," and "Watch an enemy\nto find its weak spot". That kinda thing.
5	I'm a bit reckless, so I'd just try and\nkite the enemy. He put me straight on\nthat.
6	We've lost a great man...
tlk4342014503_ms.json
1	So you're the new leaders of the\nGarfont Mercenaries?
2	I hear all sorts of good things\nabout you.
3	I'm glad to see you're carrying on\nVandham's traditions.
4	And you have that Blade\nRoc too, right? With those\nunusual Dual Scythes?
5	Feels like you really are carrying on\nin Vandham's footsteps. Keep it up!
tlk4342014504_ms.json
1	The Garfont Mercenaries have really\ncome on in leaps and bounds.
2	Bet they're stronger than even when\nVandham was in charge.
3	When you go back to base after\na long absence, do you have lots\nof new recruits?
4	If you want to be a truly great leader,\nit's important to remember the faces\nof the mercenaries you command.
5	Do you think you could name them?

1	I heard that the streets of Indol are as\nbeautiful as a work of art. I'm here\nfrom Uraya for sightseeing.
2	The Sanctum is majestic and the\nstreets are laid out beautifully...
3	But the refugee camp...\nWell, I suppose there's not much that\ncan be done about it...
4	Despite all the help they get, they still\nsay they're against Blades? Perhaps\nthey should consider moving on then.
tlk4342017102_ms.json
1	Sure is a good thing my Blade's\nso powerful!
2	The other day my Blade found a poor\nsod who'd fallen onto Indol's back.
3	She was from the refugee camp,\nsaid she didn't want any help from\na Blade. Got quite angry...
4	But we couldn't just leave her there\nlike that, so we had to manhandle\nher out of there!
tlk4342017103_ms.json
1	Probably about time I was heading\nback to Uraya. I've done plenty of\nsightseeing.
2	My Blade's saying something bad's in\nthe air. It's creeping me out.
3	Maybe it's something and nothing, but\nI've seen enough for now, so it's a good\nenough time to be off home.
tlk4342034101_ms.json
1	I'll tell you something good.
2	Roc loves to eat fish.
3	Vandham's favorite meal is an Armu\nT-Bone Steak.
4	Maybe you just eat anything on hand\nwhen you're out adventuring...
5	but eating something you like or love\ngives you a much bigger effect.
6	It also helps build Trust with\nyour Blade.
7	It's important to check your allies'\npreferences when you're off\nadventuring.
tlk4342034102_ms.json
1	Don't know why but there's something\nreally interesting about tending to trees.
2	I see that you've spotted that\nVandham's hobby was growing trees.
3	Seemed a waste to let them die, so\nI've been taking care of them.
4	Vandham was pretty special at growing\nthings - both people and trees.
5	It's hard losing your friends...
6	But you've got to keep moving forward.\nThat's what he would have wanted.

1	The mercenary groups have an\ninfluence on the Development Level\nof each country.
2	Raising a country's Development\nLevel will create new business\nopportunities.
3	Trading with other countries will\nlead to the creation of new products.
4	In turn, work for mercenaries will\nincrease...
5	Completing more missions will further\ndevelop the countries, and so on...
6	The Garfont Mercenaries that Vandham\nbuilt up are now your responsibility.
tlk4342034105_ms.json
1	You know Cole in Fonsa Myma, right?
2	Vandham introduced me to him once.
3	I stopped by his place when I was over\nin Fonsa Myma recently.
4	Seems he's getting sicker. He's in\na bad way...
5	I was wondering if you'd be able\nto help him...
tlk4342034106_ms.json
1	Heard Cole's back on his feet.
2	Nothing I could do to help...\nBut I knew you'd come through.
3	I want to show there's more to\nmercenaries than people think.
4	You know, by doing the right thing\nby anyone who needs help.
5	You know, the kind of thing that\nVandham would have approved of.
tlk4342034107_ms.json
1	Ohhh, how am I ever going to find\nthe manpower for this?
2	Well, the thing is, we started providing\nthis new service recently.
3	Basically, we find things people lost\non their travels. It's mainly targeted at\nadventurers and merchants.
4	After all, we travel to all sorts of places\nfor our mercenary work, you know?
5	So if we search for people's lost things\nwhile we're there, it lets us earn extra\nrewards more efficiently.
6	Problem is, it's become such a popular\nservice, we're going to need a specialist\nteam to keep up with all the requests...
7	That would help us a lot, thank you!\nI hope it won't tire you out!
tlk4350014101_ms.json
1	Welcome, friend. Fonsa Myma is\nsometimes known as the City of Art.\nDoes any of our artwork entice you?
2	Why, if it isn't our esteemed owner!\nYou're always more than welcome\nat this establishment.
tlk4350014201_ms.json
1	What do you want, young'un?\nI'm done with my mercenary\nconsultation sessions for today.
2	Oh, you're not mercenaries?\nSorry, then. Guess I got the wrong idea.
3	I'd still be glad to lend you a\nword of advice if there's anything\ntroubling you, mind.
4	I used to be the leader of a mercenary\nband, y'see, so I know a thing or two.
5	Well, if it isn't Vandham. I've heard\nall sorts of tales about the things\nyou've been getting up to.
6	In all my years, I never heard of a\nmercenary band taking in orphans\nfrom across the land until yours!
7	From the looks of things, I'll wager\nyou're sticking your nose in to help\nanother band of youths right now, eh?
8	Well, I'm not going to stop you,\nbut try to look out for yourself too\nonce in a while.
tlk4350014202_ms.json
1	So Vandham kicked the bucket, did he?\nI guess good men really do die young.
2	I wonder what'll become of the\nGarfont Mercenaries without him.
3	They're a talented bunch, but Vandham\nwas basically the driving force behind\ntheir whole way of life.
4	I'd be lying if I said I wasn't\na little worried for them.
tlk4350014203_ms.json
1	It ain't easy being a former mercenary\nleader. People are always coming to me\nand asking for advice.
2	Ah, you must be the ones who have\ntaken over old Vandham's position!
3	I was a mite worried about the future\nof the Garfont Mercenaries, you know.
4	But it looks like you've made\na decent start for yourselves.
5	You probably won't have many\nmissions to take care of to begin with.
6	But if you keep doing them at\na steady pace, you'll build up a\nreputation for reliability.
7	That'll earn you more missions\nsooner or later.
tlk4350014204_ms.json
1	I'm sure you've heard already, but just\nto make this clear, there's always a\nconstant flow of mercenary missions.
2	You'll be asked to help out with\nthings like guard duty, escort duty,\nharvesting...
3	Remember which missions require\nthe least effort, because it's never\na bad idea to repeat those ones.
4	But no matter the mission, it's always\nworth tackling each one at least once.
5	There's always a big reward waiting\nfor you the first time you finish.
tlk4350014205_ms.json
1	The Garfont Mercenaries really seem\nto have recovered splendidly. I hear\nword of them even around these parts.
2	Looks like you really have been\ntreading in Vandham's footsteps.
3	You make the other Merc Groups\nlook bad. Still, it wouldn't hurt for\nthem to be a bit more proactive...
4	Vandham's group started making a\nname for themselves back when I\nused to lead my own squad.
5	That didn't sit well with me, so I tried\neverything I could to get in their way.
6	Like dumping all my mushroom\nleftovers in a Garfont cave.
7	Nobody does pranks like that any\nmore nowadays, you know.\nReal shame if you ask me...
tlk4350014206_ms.json
1	The whole town seems to know about\nthe Garfont Mercenaries now.
2	That puts you a step above your\npredecessor, I reckon.
3	In fact, I'd go so far as to say you've\nrewritten history for the Merc Group!
4	Till now, bosses like me and Vandham\nwho lead the mercs have never really\nbeen particular about details.
5	People always thought of us as a band\nof rough, tough hired hands who fight\nmonsters and do the dirty work.
6	But you've been treating every case\nwith so much care and attention, it's\nhard to think that way any more.
7	Men, women, and children all feel they\ncan rely on you. I don't think there's\nanyone on Alrest quite like that.

1	年寄りじゃからとて　元は傭兵団長！\nこのようなところで逃げ出せるかいの！
2	ワシが注意を引きつける間に\n一般市民の避難を優先させるのじゃ！
3	――こうしておけば　生き残った時に\n国から好待遇を受けられるのじゃよ
4	傭兵は自分の利益を最優先に戦う！\nそれが結果的に人の命を救うだけの話じゃ！
tlk4350014301_ms.json
1	Mercs who haven't been assigned\nmissions undergo training here.
2	Launch a toppled enemy into the air!
3	Then focus your attacks on it and\ndeal it some major damage!
4	And finally, finish it off with a good old\nsmash!
5	...That's what I keep telling 'em, but\nthey can't seem to get it right.
6	They'll never be able do all of that by\nthemselves. You need teamwork, that's\nwhat. Eh, they'll work it out eventually.
tlk4350014302_ms.json
1	In the mercenaries, one wrong move\nand it could be the end for you.
2	Even the boss of the Garfont Merc\nGroup doesn't get any special\ntreatment there...
3	He was a mighty figure, lively and\nspirited, and loved by all, to be sure.\nBut in death, we're all equal.
4	Why the long face? If you're inheriting\nhis legacy, then you'd better get your\nact together.
5	Don't doubt yourself. Just keep on\nwalking your own path. Because\nforward's the only way you can go.
tlk4350014303_ms.json
1	Listen here, young'un...
2	I think you've grown a mite too\nattached to some of your Blades.
3	With the Merc Group as prosperous\nas it is, you should be able to manage\nplenty of Blades now, no?
4	Well then, I'd urge you to try taking all\nsorts of different Blades along with you\non your adventures.
5	Variety is the spice of life, you know.\nIt'll help you grow as a Driver!
tlk4350014304_ms.json
1	巨神獣そのものが戦ってんだ\n儂らにできるのは待つことだけじゃな
2	何　ヴァンダムの小僧が作った居場所だ\nそう簡単に壊れたりはしないだろうぜ
tlk4350014305_ms.json
1	I've never felt the Urayan Titan shake\nlike that before, not ever.
2	I can't believe we're really going to\njoin all the other Titans at the World\nTree...
3	Is this the end of Alrest as we know it?
4	Well, come what may, you can be sure\nI'll be watching out for Garfont!
5	I was a skilled Driver in my time, you\nknow! I've had a couple of decades'\nrest, so I'll fight tooth and claw for us!
6	Ah!
7	Almost forgot...\nI don't have a Blade.
tlk4350014306_ms.json
1	I suppose we've you to thank for the\nMerc Group's tremendous growth.
2	Now we've got a rock-solid foundation,\nit might be a good time to try staging\nmock battles with other groups.
3	Well, we're not going to get anywhere\nwith just bodybuilding and practice\nswings at the training ground, are we?
4	No, I think it's a good opportunity to\nput ourselves to the test and see how\nwe measure up to the rest!
5	Glad you agree, young'un!
6	It so happens we've got one such\nindividual lined up for you to fight\nalready. Well? What do you say?
7	Needless to say, this match is the real\ndeal, so you better give it your all out\nthere, you hear?
tlk4350014701_ms.json
1	I hear there's this Blade called the\nAegis that's been resurrected.
2	If the program at Mymoma Playhouse\nis anything to go by, it's the one that\ndestroyed Alrest 500 years ago.
3	There's been a public notice issued\nby the Urayan army about it, telling\nus to stay vigilant.
4	Apparently we're to be on the lookout\nfor a green Core Crystal...
5	...
6	Hmm. Well, I'm not going to bother\nmuch about it.
tlk4350014702_ms.json
1	That bloke Cole at Mymoma Playhouse\nis really a master of his craft.
2	But there's something a bit suspicious\nabout him...
3	He's always got that hood up. Hard\nto tell if he's even really an Urayan.
4	I hear he used to be a mercenary too.
5	I can't imagine how he\nwound up in showbiz...
tlk4350014703_ms.json
1	Head down this way and you'll\nreach a shop called Malbren\nSalvaging. Heard of it?
2	Yeah, salvaging's not the most active\nof businesses round here.
3	It's as silent as the grave around there.
4	I feel bad for them. You should really\ngo pay them a visit.
5	They've probably got a different\nselection by now.
tlk4350014704_ms.json
1	My granddad said he met\nKing Eulogimenos once,\na long time ago.
2	You've heard of him, right?\nThe king of Tantal?
3	Anyway, it was a few decades ago.\nThe king was still young and free,\nout traveling the world.
4	My grandad asked him what he thought\nof Uraya. He said he was a little\ndisappointed with the lack of salvaging.
5	Seems the king was a bit of a salvager\nfreak back in the day.
6	Yeah, he's quite a treasure hoarder\nfrom what I hear.
tlk4360014101_ms.json
1	Welcome to Aldomar Books.\nWe have many volumes here devoted\nto the fine arts.
2	Back again, are we? You really do\nhave curious tastes, owner.
3	We should be getting in some antique\nbooks quite soon.
4	We have some antique books available.
tlk4360014201_ms.json
1	Concerned
2	The only ones who seem to come\nto me for money are the ones under\nsorry circumstances.
3	You saw for yourself, didn't you?
4	We're on the verge of war with Mor\nArdain and the people have to get\nby on rations.
5	But the nobles in their ivory towers\nare living as extravagantly as ever.
6	The mercenaries don't seem to have\nit quite so bad either, as it's normal\nfor them to be hired as soldiers.
7	What I'm saying is that there's disparity\nin the social classes.
8	And I won't deny it, I'm just as\nguilty of exploiting others for my\nown benefit! Ha ha ha...
tlk4360014202_ms.json
1	It's such a shame...
2	We were so close to open war with\nMor Ardain, but it was averted at\nthe last moment.
3	It would have been my big chance to\nrake in the big bucks...
4	Lending money to injured soldiers,\nbereaving widows... There's really\nnothing like wartime profits.
5	Just whose side is Her Majesty on?
tlk4360014203_ms.json
1	Do you know what I want more than\nanything else right now?
2	Money.
3	Or rather, I should say, security.
4	I think that the way things are going,\nAlrest as we know it will be coming\nto an end.
5	The Titans have all gathered together\nin one place and everyone's started\nfighting each other. It's patently clear.
6	There's no guarantee any of us will\nmake it out of this alive.
7	But if anyone's out there willing to\nhelp me survive, then, by the Architect,\nI'll pay them every penny I've got!
tlk4360014301_ms.json
1	The cost of living's been going right\nup these past few years.
2	I guess the country preparing for war's\nhad a big impact on the economy.
3	Especially after Mor Ardain got to\nGormott before us.
4	We really can't afford to lose this time.
5	So I've decided that I want to do my\npart to help.
6	Still, I do think the cost of food's far\ntoo expensive right now.
7	Just how much do they expect us to\npay for one Glarna?!
tlk4360014302_ms.json
1	So you know how I was complaining\nabout the cost of living going up?
2	No?
3	Well, either way...
4	From what my son tells me, the price\nof commodities should drop as Uraya\ndevelops as a country.
5	The more we buy and sell, and the\nmore problems we solve, the more\nwe'll improve.
6	There's little I can do to contribute\nat my age, but you youngsters can\ncertainly do something to help.
tlk4360014303_ms.json
1	Don't you think that goods have gotten\na lot cheaper in Fonsa Myma lately?
2	I for one am glad for that!
3	What? There's a movement to\nincrease foreign trade and get more\nproducts on the market?
4	My son told me trade would improve\nas the mercenaries in Gar-something\nor other completed missions.
5	Well, good luck to them!
tlk4360014304_ms.json
1	Ever hear of Char-Grilled Grumbird?
2	It's probably the tastiest thing I've\never eaten in my life, and that's no\nexaggeration!
3	First time I tasted it, it almost moved\nme to tears, it was so delicious.
4	Never thought us working with\nMor Ardain would introduce us\nto a delicacy like that!
5	The way I see it, Alrest's going to pot\nanyway, so I may as well blow all my\nsavings on the food.
6	I ain't got that many years on the\nclock left, but experiencing food like\nthat, I think I can go happy now.
tlk4370014101_ms.json
1	It was Vandham that inspired me\nto join the mercs. I just can't believe\nhe's gone...
2	It was a long time ago now...\nI was a merc in Fonsa Myma.
3	I happened to get paired up with\nVandham on a mission.
4	He was a paragon among mercenaries.
5	I want to do everything I can to\nhelp the Garfont Mercs and carry\non his legacy...
tlk4370014102_ms.json
1	There's a limit to the number of Blades\nyou can have in your team.
2	Makes sense, since there's only\nso many you can go traveling with\nat once.
3	It's sad, but saying goodbye's\nan inevitable part of life...
4	But when the time comes, they'll be\nsure to leave you a parting gift.
5	It just shows you that they're thinking\nof their Driver till the very end...
6	You'll have to make good use of the\ngifts!
tlk4370014103_ms.json
1	I still haven't gone to Vandham's\ngrave yet...
2	I'm thinking I'll go and tell the old guy\nthat his band's even greater now than\nback when he was the boss.
3	I haven't been in Garfont from the\nbeginning, but even I can tell it's been\ngrowing at an incredible rate.
4	...I guess the secret to success is to\ntrust in your Blades with total faith...
5	There are no Drivers quite like you\nanywhere in Alrest.
tlk4370014201_ms.json
1	Well, well, well! Have I got a beaut of\na drink for you! I worked in the service\nof the high court, so I know my stuff!
2	In fact, I'll give you a full refund if you\ncan keep a straight face! Gahaha!
3	Good to see you, owner! As ever,\nI provide only the most exquisite drinks,\nbased on my days at the high court!
tlk4370014301_ms.json
1	Oh, here comes a promising one!
2	You're here to apply for our Merc\nGroup, right?
3	For you, I think we can make an\nexception. We'll hire you straight up,\nno demonstration of skills needed.
4	Come in, don't be shy!
5	...Oh, that's not why you're here?
6	Well, just remember, you're always\nwelcome!
7	Any time you're pressed for money\nor you want a good fight, just come\nover to us, yeah?
8	Been a while since you\npaid us a visit, bossman.
9	It's rare for you to come all the way\nto Fonsa Myma.
10	Here on business, I take it?\nIf it's something good, let me in\non it, will ya?
tlk4370014302_ms.json
1	I can't believe it. Vandham's not the\nsort of bloke who just...dies.
2	I'll have to go to the Olethro Ruins and\npay my respects next chance I get.
3	I hear it's a den of fierce monsters,\nbut I'm a merc. I can handle it.
4	...Then again, if I go there alone,\nmaybe I'm just adding one more\ngrave to the collection...
5	Think I'll head out after I've gathered\nanother five of my mates.
6	'Cos here in Uraya, six is the standard\nnumber of mercs that'd you get in a\nsquad.
tlk4370014303_ms.json
1	It's risky business, being a merc. You\nnever know when your time'll be up.
2	I keep having to remind myself\nthat every time I'm heading out\non a mission.
3	What happened on Temperantia,\nthough...now that was a disaster.
4	My thoughts go out to those poor\nsouls who lost their lives there.
5	They were wiped out by something out\nof their control. No amount of skill or\npreparation could have helped them.
6	The ones who made it out alive just\nhad the better luck.
7	If lives are lost and wars are won\nthrough chance, we may as well decide\nthem with Gladiator Wrestling...
8	It's a game where you get little paper\ndolls and nudge them with your finger\nto try and knock your opponent over.
9	They're selling sets at Hobby\nKnick-Knacks if you're interested.
tlk4370014304_ms.json
1	I'm gobsmacked.\nGarfont's like a whole different place...
2	Never mind carrying on Vandham's\nlegacy, I think you've built a whole\ndarn empire here!
3	Even the mercs from our lot are\nstarting to want to join them.
4	I jest, of course. You don't want\nthe entire town to be overrun with\nbig, muscly gorillas, do you?
5	We've got at least a dozen like the\nold bossman in our squad!
6	GAHAHAHA!
tlk4370014901_ms.json
1	Fellow mercenaries, are you?
2	Fonsa Myma's in a state of panic\npreparing for the war to come.
3	Make sure you don't stand out too\nmuch in case the army draft you into\ntheir ranks.
4	Well, I figure we'll all get dragged into\nit somehow eventually.
5	Uraya's armed forces are essentially\nmade up of both the regular army and\nthe mercenaries.
6	And come wartime, us mercs'll be\nswimming in gold!
tlk4370014902_ms.json
1	Ah, a fellow compatriot.
2	You probably already know\nthis, but different classes give\ndifferent benefits.
3	It can affect your attack, defense...\neven your recovery abilities.
4	Make sure to bring plenty of Blades\nalong with you and find the class that\nsuits you best.
tlk4370014903_ms.json
1	I was convinced we were going to war,\nbut they called the whole thing off...
2	It'll be a bitter pill to swallow for Mor\nArdain, but more importantly, for Indol.
3	You really think they'll let off those\nguys in the buffer zone after digging\nup something crazy like that?
4	The army and mercs here were all\nriled up and ready for action, too.
5	If the queen had given the word, we'd\nhave been down on them like a ton of\nbricks.
tlk4370014904_ms.json
1	No time to be worrying about Uraya\nor Mor Ardain or what your pals think\nof you now...
2	At this rate, we'll all be going down\ntogether...
3	And at this late stage, I finally realized\nsomething.
4	That all this would never have\nhappened if we'd just worked\ntogether from the start.
5	But that's always the case in hindsight,\nisn't it? This is a lesson we'd never\nhave learned otherwise.
tlk4370024101_ms.json
1	Wha... You guys again?!
2	Y-you really taught me a lesson\nback there.
3	I lost because I wasn't able to fully\nmake use of my Aux Cores.
4	I could have equipped something with\na fire-damage reduction effect to\nweaken the Aegis's attacks...
5	Or I could have used a jamming effect\nto dodge ranged attacks. If I'd done\nsomething like that, I would have won!
6	That's not to say I'm going to try it,\nbut believe me, it's true!
tlk4370024102_ms.json
1	I lost to you because I wasn't using\nmy Aux Cores properly.
2	You know how there's one called\nDamage Heal?
3	If you equip that, then every time you\nget attacked, you get a portion of HP\nback.
4	If the Aegis ever decided to fight me\nagain, I'd be able to stand up to her\nnow without being such a pushover!
tlk4370024103_ms.json
1	You know how there's an Aux Core\ncalled Opening Art?
2	If I had that equipped and I got the\ninitiative, I'd have taken down the\nAegis before she could even blink...
3	Wait, why am I even telling you this?!
4	And here I thought I had the perfect\ncomeback plan...
5	But now that I've told you, I'll have\nto scrap that idea. Well, back to the\ndrawing board...
tlk4370024104_ms.json
1	It's best if you switch around your\nAux Cores to best suit your Blades\nand the enemies you're up against.
2	Like if you're up against enemies\nthat only appear at night, equip\nNight Vision.
3	Or if you move around a lot to get\ninto better positions, Movement Heal\nis what you want.
4	See? I've got myself genned up on Aux\nCores so I can defend myself the next\ntime the Aegis wants a fight!
5	I know so much about Aux Cores now,\nI've even got friends coming to me for\nadvice.
6	I'm actually surprised myself. Never\nthought I was the type to get myself\nso invested in something!
7	Guess I have to thank the Aegis for\nthat too!
tlk4410018401_ms.json
1	Hey, outlanders! Come and see!\nLook - it's a patch of green! Isn't\nit amazing?!
2	We hardly get any green here in Tantal.\nNot outside town anyway.
3	I, uh, I really like plants. But we're not\nallowed to leave Tantal to find any...
4	I wish I could go out and see all the\nplants I read about in the library.\nBut it's kind of impossible, huh...
tlk4410018402_ms.json
1	Outlanders! Hey listen, apparently\nwhen I'm older I'll be allowed to\nleave Tantal too!
2	I really love plants. I read all about\nthem in an encyclopedia in the library.\nI want to go out and find them all!
3	But in the meantime, I need to go and\nexplore Tantal and find all the plants\nthat haven't been discovered yet!
tlk4410018403_ms.json
1	Hey, did you see the World Tree?\nBecause I did!
2	The sky between the gaps in the Titan\nwent all green... It was amaaazing!
3	I'd love to see it closer up, though.\nI wonder how I'd be able to do that...
tlk4420018301_ms.json
1	Theosoir is an amazing place, don't\nyou think?
2	I read about Alrest's cities in books\nand encyclopedias, but they don't\nseem nearly as pretty as here.
3	I just don't get why everyone's all kind\nof gloomy.
4	My grandma and grandpa always\nlook sort of miserable...
5	It's weird, because if they love the\ncity like I do, they should be happy,\nall day, every day!
tlk4420018302_ms.json
1	So we're not related to Addam then?
2	Mama, Papa, Grandma, and\nGranddad were all terribly upset\nwhen they found out about that.
3	But doesn't this mean that Tantal's\nfree now?
4	I want to visit all the other countries\nand find the prettiest-looking places!
5	There are so many exciting things to\nsee and do in the world... So why do\nadults always look so sad?
tlk4420018303_ms.json
1	I'm still keeping my promise to Dahlia,\nyou know!
2	I'm playing outside a lot and eating\nup all my dinner!
3	And I'm doing all my homework too!
4	I don't mind if I get to do it for pretty\nlady Dahlia!
5	I'm gonna be a Driver someday, so\nmake sure you give her to me when\nI'm ready!
tlk4420018501_ms.json
1	You! Outlander! Have you any books?\nAny books? Books from the outside?
2	Huff... My apologies.\nIt's just that I've read pretty much all\nI could from the library already...
3	So I thought that visitors from the\noutside might have Urayan books,\nor Ardainian ones...
4	I'd love to read some books from the\noutside, but Tantal won't have anything\nto do with other countries.
tlk4420018502_ms.json
1	We're now able to order books\nfrom abroad, so I went and asked\nmy mum first thing!
2	I got this one from Argentum,\ncalled "The Millenarian Titan".
3	It's an epic story following one Titan\nover the course of its very long life.
4	I'm dying to know what happens next,\nbut I'm making myself read only one\npage per day. That way it'll last me!
tlk4420018503_ms.json
1	Hey, so... Is our Titan gonna wind up\nsinking into the Cloud Sea one day,\njust like in "The Millenarian Titan"?
2	Oh, don't you know that book?\nThe story follows a Titan for the\nentire long course of its life.
3	Towards the end, the exhausted Titan\ngrows colder and colder, until no one\ncan stop it sinking beneath the clouds...
4	What? You mean, you're gonna\ntry and save our Titan somehow?\nWow, you're like real heroes!
5	
tlk4420018504_ms.json
1	Formalities
2	Ahh, what I'd give to be able to read\na new novel...
3	I think I've all but exhausted the\nvolumes that the Library Philosofia\nhas to offer.
4	I heard there was once a girl who read\nevery last book in that place.
5	Of course, I'm only interested in\nprose. The purpler, the better!
6	If only someone were around to give\nme something new to read...
7	Wow! Thank you!
8	I don't care about how recent the\nstory is. Just as long as it's something\nthat's not in the library!
tlk4430008101_ms.json
1	Morning.\nFeel like having some fresh fish\nin Tantal? I'm your guy!
2	Hey there, Boss.\nI've been waiting for you.
tlk4430008201_ms.json
1	Welcome! I handle new editions here,\nrecent books that haven't made it to\nthe library yet.
2	Good thing you like books, eh, Boss?\nThough I guess you wouldn't be Boss\nif you didn't... Anyway, take a look!
tlk4430008301_ms.json
1	Ohh, my darling... Your heart is as\nimpenetrable as Theoscaldia... How\ncan I coax you to open your gates?
2	...I'd thank you for not interrupting.\nI'm using the landscape here to\nwoo my beloved.
3	The city of Theosoir is very secure...\nIt may be the embodiment of history,\nuninterrupted since the time of Addam.
4	Hoho... The more sturdy the keep,\nthe greater the satisfaction does its\ndownfall bring!
5	
tlk4430008302_ms.json
1	Have you heard? They say that\nthe Tantalese royals are not, after\nall, descended from Addam...
2	I was using talk of our Addamite\nhistory and this castle's solidity\nto try and win over this girl...
3	But when she told me about the\ndescendant thing, it was my heart's\nmighty ramparts that crumbled away...
4	Though I'm rather pleased she even\nspoke to me at all! My ramparts will\nbe soaring again in no time.
tlk4430008303_ms.json
1	彼女は絶対に俺が守るんだ！\n誰にも傷つかせたりはしない！
2	俺は気付いちまったんだ\n彼女を真剣に愛しているって事に
3	もし彼女に危害を加えるってんなら\n王様だって神様だって許さないからな！
tlk4430008501_ms.json
1	You're outlanders. Have you ever been\nto Mor Ardain?
2	I was a salvager there way back when.
3	A lot happened, and, well, now I'm\nliving in Tantal.
4	So how was Mor Ardain? The Titan's\nstill alive, right?
5	That so...\nSo he's still got a place to go home to...\nAh, sorry. Just thinking to myself.
tlk4430008502_ms.json
1	Feel free to make use of the things\nfrom Azgall's stash.
2	We both used to love showing off\nrare finds to anyone who cared.
3	If the contents of that chest make you\nhappy, I'm sure that would be more\nthan enough for him.
tlk4430018101_ms.json
1	I am but a humble bard.
2	I haven't a chance of leaving Tantal...
3	In fact, my only talent is to sing the\nballads my master taught me, and\nthat gets me pittance.
4	The ballad of Addam is particularly\npopular around here.
5	In fact, I've sung it so many times,\nI can hardly remember the words\nto the rest of the songs...
tlk4430018102_ms.json
1	Those eyes look like the eyes of a\nsoul seeking a ballad, am I right?
2	But I'm afraid I can't sing for you alone.
3	The Ballad of Addam's Embercakes\nis particularly popular right now.
4	You know embercakes? They're selling\nlike hotcakes at Lectica Vegetables.\nIt's one of Theosoir's specialties!
5	They say it was Addam's favorite\nfood, and that he would always eat\none before battle.
6	The saying goes that a Driver who can\nstomach spicy food will be equally as\nstrong in battle.
tlk4430018103_ms.json
1	Ahhh! It's you!
2	You defeated Thanatobeast Andraz,\ndidn't you?
3	Please, tell me what happened,\nin as much detail as you can!
4	Mmhmm! Go on, go on...
5	So in the end, you were not able to\ndefeat it, but Zenobia smashed it\nhigh into the sky?
6	Oh, what good fortune I have today,\nthat I may have the honor to meet\nsuch a mighty warrior as Zenobia!
7	And His Highness Zeke and his loyal\ncohorts as well, of course!
8	I will weave your tale into a ballad for\nthe ages! And I'll embellish the truth a\ntouch with a third and final verse.
9	Let there be another legend born\ntoday in Tantal!
tlk4430018301_ms.json
1	My, my. You've come from the outside,\nhaven't you? Well then, you must find\nour city quite cold?
2	Here, we use the power of Ether\nfor warmth... But yes, it is cold.\nRather.
3	To fight the cold we eat Stralu and\nAddam's Embercakes. And drink... Oh,\nminors are present? Never mind, then.
tlk4430018302_ms.json
1	I just had meat, first time in ages!\nI feel so nourished! Yum!
2	You gotta remember, it's hard to get\nedible meat round these parts.
3	But ever since foreign trade restarted,\nmeat's become a bit more accessible!\nNot that much, though...but it's a start!
tlk4430018303_ms.json
1	This might be the last dinner I ever eat.\nIt's a sad thought, but here we are...
2	I wish I had had a chance to try more\nof the delicious foods and drinks that\nAlrest has on offer.
3	I wish I'd traveled more, seen\nGormott at least... But in reality,\nI've never even left Tantal...
tlk4430018304_ms.json
1	Topic
2	Gosh, am I dying for some Stralu...
3	I could eat it all day and never get sick\nof it!
4	My favorite's the kind with roast\nBuloofo in it.
5	But you'd be fool to try and take one\ndown at this time of year. They're\nextremely protective of their young.
6	But it's because it's so rare to come\nby that I'm so desperate for some!
7	Really?! You'll help a greedy swine\nlike me?
8	Well! I'll pay you handsomely for this.\nHappy hunting!
tlk4430018401_ms.json
1	It's the same exact scene every time,\nbut still I keep coming here...
2	My shop used to be on this street.\nIt's long gone now, though...
3	I sold Tantalese wares, but then supply\nbecame a problem, prices went\nsoaring...
4	And then when the black market\nstarted up... I went bust. Now my life\ndepends on that same black market...
tlk4430018402_ms.json
1	I used to run a shop here. Alas,\nthings took a turn for the worse\nand I had to close down.
2	Some Nopon from Argentum came,\nasked me if I wouldn't come set up\nand sell my wares there.
3	That black market isn't going to last\nforever, so I'm thinking I might take\nthem up on that offer.
4	But now... What kind of shop\nshould I run? Oh, the possibilities!
tlk4430018403_ms.json
1	Damn it all to hell...\nWhy now... Why now...?
2	I used to have a shop here, but\nthen it closed down for a while.
3	Now some Nopon from Argentum\ncame and asked me to open up anew,\nand I was just making preparations.
4	And now, these damn Titans fighting...\nBut I won't give up! I'll open the shop,\nif it's the last thing I do!
tlk4431018101_ms.json
1	Mgh? Oh, you are...\nYou're from the outside, aren't you?
2	If you're just travelers stopping by,\nI'd appreciate it if you could clear out\nas soon as you're ready.
3	Tantal has limited interaction with\nthe other nations...
4	It's forbidden to trade in unlicensed\ngoods, but some people still try to\nsell board games... Such bother.
tlk4431018102_ms.json
1	Mgh, you've...come from the outside.
2	Welcome to Theosoir,\nthe Tantalese capital!
3	Before, there were strict limits on\nentering the country, but now those\nrules are being relaxed.
4	And even board games, which used to\nbe contraband until recently, are being\nsold in the open! You should see it!
tlk4431018103_ms.json
1	Welcome to Theosoir,\nthe Tantalese capital!
2	The world's in turmoil, but my job\nis the same: keeping the peace, and\nguiding outlanders around.
3	So, now. Are you tired? Go to\nAnastatia's! Hungry? The shops at\nElmos Square will sort you out.
tlk4431018201_ms.json
1	This is Theoscaldia, Theosoir's\nroyal palace.
2	You. Outlanders. Tantal is a\ntranquil place. You will not be\npermitted to disturb the peace.
3	If you don't follow our rules, you'll be\ndeported with the utmost expedience.\nBear that in mind.
tlk4431018202_ms.json
1	You guys are the worst...\nDoctors say it'll take me ten days\nto recover from your attacks.
2	Kidding, kidding! There's no hard\nfeelings, really. I should've been\nmade of stronger stuff.
3	Yeah, I'm actually rather embarrassed\nfor myself, so confident that you could\nnever take me on...
4	But at least now I know my weakness,\nso I can adjust my training regimen to\ncompensate, like a good soldier!
tlk4431018203_ms.json
1	I can't even imagine the coming war...
2	We've only got spears to guard the\ncitizens with, on the king's orders...
3	...Our future is in your hands.\nMay Addam's blessing be upon ye.
tlk4431018204_ms.json
1	Well, this isn't good...
2	A small platoon headed up the Norb\nMountains for marching practice.
3	But they took a wrong turn and ended\nup in Volff hunting grounds. Looks like\nthey took a bit of battering...
4	We're in the middle of assembling\na rescue squad, but we're a little\nunderstaffed right now...
5	Hmm? You'll lend us some of your\nmercs?
6	...Sorry to have dragged you into this.\nWe won't forget your help.
tlk4431018501_ms.json
1	This is Theosoir, the capital of Tantal.
2	It's not often that a traveler comes\nhere. Mind you conduct yourself quietly\nand respectfully!
3	Prince Ozychlyrus!\nPlease, by all means, pass through!\n... Long may Theosoir thrive!
4	...Ah, but, if at all possible, would you\nmind avoiding any flamboyant displays,\nso as not to alarm the citizenry...?
tlk4431018502_ms.json
1	This is Theosoir, the capital of Tantal.
2	By order of the King, permission is no\nlonger required to enter.
3	Please, proceed.\n... Long may Theosoir thrive!
tlk4431018503_ms.json
1	This is Theosoir, the capital of Tantal.
2	Everyone feels the tension...\nI wish there was something I could do,\nbut my duty is to stand guard here.
3	Strength of arms to Prince Ozychlyrus!\nPlease leave guarding the King and\npeople to us.
tlk4431018504_ms.json
1	*big sigh*
2	Problem? Yeah, you could say that.
3	All right, so you know that they refine\nCore Chips in the palace?
4	Ether gets collected in the plaza's\nether furnace. That's then channeled\ninto the palace for refinement.
5	And because the ether runs beneath\nthe capital, it means the temperature\nhere's much warmer than the outside.
6	Since the ether furnace is always\nrunning day in, day out, it absolutely\nhas to have regular inspections.
7	Thing is, due to a certain incident,\nwe're too short-staffed to find anyone\nwho can check up on the furnace.
8	You'll lend us some manpower?\nOh, that's fantastic news!
9	So we'll be able to keep on top of the\ninspections after all and Theosoir can\nstay nice and toasty!
tlk4431018601_ms.json
1	In the event of Prince Ozychlyrus's\nreturn, I've been instructed to also\nadmit his entire retinue.
2	Yes. Entry to Theosoir is currently\nstrictly forbidden, except by express\nspecial permission.
3	Unless you're traders with the right\npermits, there's a long application\nprocess...and the answer's usually "no".
tlk4431018602_ms.json
1	I know we got orders to let anyone\nand everyone enter the city, but...\nI just can't get used to it.
2	I can't help but be suspicious of\nall these unfamiliar faces.
3	How in the world do the other nations\nkeep public order...? I guess we'll have\nto learn, and soon...
tlk4431018603_ms.json
1	The capital was built to last!\nGo on! Get inside, where it's safe!
2	Ah! Prince Ozychlyrus and his retinue!\nI didn't mean to offend.
3	I'm instructing travelers and suburban\ncitizens to get inside. That's my orders!\nThe city's strong enough to hold out.
tlk4431018604_ms.json
1	Why, you've come at just the right\ntime. There happens to be a small\nmatter we'd like you to attend to...
2	Have you perchance any mercenary\nfriends available for hire?
3	My apologies. I haven't been very\nclear.
4	You see, our good city of Theosoir\nperforms military drills with some\nfrequency.
5	We are always striving to hone our\nskills. And that got me thinking about\nthe way you train your mercenaries.
6	I think perhaps a collaborative drill,\ncombining our two forces, would be an\nexcellent way to measure ourselves up.
7	What do you think? Would any of your\nmercenary friends be interested in the\nidea, do you think?
8	You'll introduce me? Splendid,\nsplendid! I am pleased to hear it!
9	I expect with your help, the\nTantalese army shall climb to\never greater heights!
tlk4440008101_ms.json
1	Welcome! Do you have a craving for\nTantal's sweetest of sweeties?
2	We use only the fluffiest natural\nsnow in our recipes. I assure you,\nthey're delicious!
3	Welcome! Has our Star Patron fallen\nfor my divine sweets?
tlk4440008201_ms.json
1	Hello there! If you're leaving Theosoir,\nyou'd best travel well prepared. With\nour accessories, of course!
tlk4440008301_ms.json
1	Young or old, girl or boy, people\nare always in pursuit of beauty.\nGaze upon our wares and rejoice!
2	Why, hello there, Owner!\nOr should I call you, aesthete\nextraordinaire?
tlk4440008401_ms.json
1	Those are some peculiar clothes you're\nwearing. You must be outlanders.
2	You must find Tantal rather nippy, no?\nFeel free to warm yourselves up here.
3	This is a hot water source. It's heated\nup from within the Titan's body and\ngets circulated throughout the kingdom.
4	It's hard to get a warming meal\naround these parts, so I come here\nevery day just to warm myself up.
tlk4440008402_ms.json
1	I hear we're finally warming to the idea\nof trade with the outside. I'm glad.\nI won't have to come here any more.
2	I always feel utterly freezing, not being\nable to get a decent meal around here.\nThis is the only place I can warm up.
3	The water here is heated internally,\nfrom within the Titan, so it's always\nwarm.
4	That water is spread throughout the\nkingdom. That's why you won't see\nany snow in town. It'd just melt.
tlk4440008403_ms.json
1	Just when it got easier to find good\nfood, now a war breaks out?
2	My daughter's getting very worried...\nI thought warming up here would do us\nboth good, but no. How about you?
3	The water here is heated internally,\nfrom within the Titan, so it's always\nwarm.
4	That water is spread throughout the\nkingdom. That's why you won't see\nany snow in town. It'd just melt.
tlk4440008404_ms.json
1	Hmm...
2	Ah, it's just a small thing that's been\non my mind...
3	Now, Theosoir is quite a warm place,\nbut Tantal as a whole is rather chilly,\nisn't it?
4	Not only that, but the living costs are\nvery high too. The children can rarely\nafford to buy new clothes.
5	So I thought, well, why don't I try\nmaking some warm clothes for them\nmyself?
6	But then I realized I'd need many more\nFresh Rodonya pelts if I was going to\nmake that happen.
7	I don't suppose you could help, could\nyou...?
8	You'll get some pelts for me? Well!\nYou're too kind!
9	In that case, I'll let you get on with it\nthen! Ta very much!
tlk4440008501_ms.json
1	You've come from the outside,\nhaven't you? Allow me to teach\nyou about our city.
2	You see the tower-like structure in the\ncenter of Elmos Square? The Titan's\nether flows through that.
3	We use the energy to heat our\nwater, which is circulated throughout\nthe kingdom.
4	So even if there's a frightful blizzard\noutside, we get to stay lovely and\ntoasty. Insightful, no?
tlk4440008502_ms.json
1	You've come from the outside,\nhaven't you? Allow me to teach\nyou about our city.
2	You may not know this, but our Crown\nPrince goes by the name of Zeke.
3	He looks much like his father, King\nEulogimenos. Very sharp, striking\nfeatures. But unlike his father...
4	Go on... I'm listening.
5	Eeek! Your Highness! Err, umm...but\nunlike his father, he...he has a very...\nentertaining mode of expression!
6	So people find me funny? Excellent!\nThat's just what I was going for!
7	Whenever he opens his mouth, there is\nan incessant flow of verbal...nobility.
8	Sorry if I'm not being very specific...\nI'm sure you'll understand if you talk\nto him.
tlk4440008503_ms.json
1	I wish someone could reassure me that\nthings are going to turn out fine...
2	But no, I'm sure we'll pull through. His\nMajesty is still going strong, and our\nCrown Prince has shown his mettle!
3	If we continue to be as determined and\npositive as His Highness Zeke, I'm sure\nthings will turn out just dandy.
4	
tlk4440008601_ms.json
1	My concoction... It was a perfect\nsuccess...but it was TOO perfect!
2	My beloved drank the love potion,\nas intended...
3	But moments later, a Nopon walking\nby tripped and cried out, and his gaze\nwas drawn to her...
4	And he's had eyes only for her ever\nsince! For a Nopon woman, married\nwith children!!!
5	I'm proud to have created such a\npotent brew, but this is not the\nresult I had hoped for...
tlk4440008901_ms.json
1	I released a companion volume to help\nsell my original book about flowers.\nWhat do you think it was about?
2	No, not dashing gentlemen, actually.\nI wrote a story about beautiful ladies\nbased on all the different flowers!
3	It was a huge hit with male readers.\nWe just can't publish enough copies\nto meet demand!
4	And that managed to put me up there\nas a bestselling author!
5	I bet you thought tales of charming\nyoung men would never sell, didn't\nyou?
6	The female reader base just can't\nget enough of the heated drama!
7	I don't imagine I'd have been able to\nmake it if it weren't for you. I greatly\nappreciate all your support!
tlk4440008902_ms.json
1	Now then class, I want you to express\nyour own concept of true beauty\nthrough prose. Let me demonstrate.
2	He rose, slender as a Gypsum Branch...
3	Crimson lips parted, he whispered,\nsoftly, words that flowed like\nMelosian Honey...
4	His eyes, fierce Pione Stones, fixated\nupon me...
5	Ahh... It's so beautiful... My heart...\nI don't care if we're in class, this is\nsimply...
tlk4440008903_ms.json
1	Bathing in spring waters,\nhow the bright droplets glint\nand sparkle in the sunlight...
2	Ahh... If only he would leap out of the\npages and whisk me away...
3	Something wrong? You look concerned.\nWhat? A lady can dream, can't she?
tlk4440008904_ms.json
1	The Flora of Alrest is selling\nspectacularly, by the way!\nThanks for all your help!
2	I've suggested a possible continuation\nto my novel. This one would revolve\naround dashing princes!
3	I'm not sure what you have or haven't\nheard, but I intend to pursue my own\nvalues of beauty through this...
4	My book about dashing gentlemen\nis selling spectacularly, by the way!\nThanks for all your help!
5	I've suggested a possible continuation\nto my novel. This one would revolve\naround handsome older men!
6	It'll be for a more mature audience,\nsomething deeper and more profound.\nSo look forward to that!
tlk4440028701_ms.json
1	Tantalese science has been passed\ndown for generations, so our knowledge\nfar surpasses the Ardainians'.
2	You are outlanders, if I'm not mistaken?\nThen I must not let myself sound as if\nwe're blowing our own trumpets.
3	Let me simply say that thanks to our\nextensive collection of records, we are\nable to address all manner of issues.
tlk4440028702_ms.json
1	Yes, I believe I can entrust you with\nthat information...
2	The ancient science of Tantal, passed\ndown through generations...remains\nunchanged to this day.
3	That's right. We have in fact not\nadvanced one jot technologically. We\nhave not evolved as has Mor Ardain.
4	If by chance something unprecedented,\nnot chronicled by our ancestors, were\nto happen...
5	Then we would fall like a house of\ncards. Just like Theospiti Temple...
tlk4440028703_ms.json
1	The situation we were all so anxious to\navoid seems to be all but inevitable.
2	Tantalese science has not evolved in\nthe way that Ardainian science has.
3	I fear whether we will really be able\nto handle what comes next...
4	I believe myself a rational man,\nyet still, I find myself praying to\nAddam for safety...
tlk4440028704_ms.json
1	I heard an interesting rumor.
2	The Nyoka Drifts are snowswept\nlandscape where man rarely sets foot...
3	But I've been hearing that the snow\nhas been melting there recently.
4	I welcome the prospect of an end to\nthe long Tantalese winter, but...
5	someone will still need to keep an\neye on things.
6	Because it's possible that this problem\ncould spread to all regions of Tantal.
7	That's what I was hoping you'd say.
8	Look into things and find the reason\nfor all this.
tlk4450018101_ms.json
1	Nice to see some outsiders for a\nchange! We don't get many round\nhere...
2	You must find it perishing with\nall the snow. Come in and thaw\nyourselves out.
tlk4450018201_ms.json
1	It's a shame Tantal is so closed off\nto the outside.
2	Our Core Chips are behind the times,\nI know, but perhaps you can make\nsome use out of them...
tlk4450018301_ms.json
1	Welcome! How are you finding Tantal?\nChilly, isn't it?
2	I recommend the Steamed Veg Stralu.\nIt'll warm you up from head to toe!
3	Nice of you to drop by, Owner!\nStill a bit nippy, isn't it? What you\nneed is a generous helping of Stralu!
tlk4450018401_ms.json
1	My goodness... Outlanders!\nOutlanders are here! I've got to\ntell everyone at once!
2	From where do you hail?\nHow fare the other countries?\nYou must tell me the latest trends...
3	Oh...dreadfully sorry. It's just that\nI haven't seen an outlander in so\nlong... It's such a rare event.
4	I thought I was going to kick the bucket\nwithout ever seeing another stranger's\nface again...
tlk4450018402_ms.json
1	Welcome, travelers from afar! I do\nhope your arrival here encourages\nmore outlanders to visit us.
2	Well, I'd certainly be happy about it,\nbut I'm not sure how well the others\nwould take it...
3	Some of us here think that having\nrelations with the outside world makes\nus more susceptible to being invaded.
4	I just hope our country's heading in\nthe right direction...
tlk4450018403_ms.json
1	I never would have imagined things\nwould come to this...
2	But still, I believe in you.\nI'm with you all the way.
3	Ever since you passed through these\ngates, I get the sense that the country's\nfinally got up off its backside.
4	Ah, I don't mean in a bad way. What's\ngood for Alrest's good for Tantal. You\njust keep fighting for the greater good!
tlk4450018404_ms.json
1	Oh! You seem to know much about the\noutside world! May we talk?
2	It's about the Tantal food supply\nproblem.
3	As you know, all Tantalese ether has\nbeen diverted to the creation of\nCore Chips.
4	This has turned the environment into\na snow desert making it impossible to\ngrow crops...
5	So if you could find some seeds that\ncan withstand the cold, we might be\nable to start growing again.
6	Oh! You'll take it on?
7	We may be able to bring back a little\npromise to Tantal if you succeed.
tlk4450018501_ms.json
1	I have made my decision. I shall spread\nthe true history of Tantal and His\nHighness's intentions to the people.
2	And let us steer those stray sheep who\ndisapprove back on the right path.
3	It has been some time since I have\npreached anything, but I will try my\nhardest to convey the new teachings.
4	Of course, were it not for Zeke, we\ncould never have achieved all this.\nThank you, my child.
tlk4450018801_ms.json
1	I'm on a break.\nI deserve it - I've been working solidly\nthrough lunchtime.
2	I'd like to retire, but there's work to\nbe done and I need the money to eat.
3	There's nothing to be done about it\nas long as this country's closed off...
4	It's grown old and stagnant...sort of\nlike me. Heh!
tlk4450018802_ms.json
1	I'm on a break.\nI deserve it - I've been working solidly\nthrough lunchtime.
2	I wonder what'll happen now\nthat we've got a steady influx\nof outlanders?
3	That's just what a youngster like you\nwould say. Bringing in the new isn't\nnecessarily always a good thing...
4	Now, what's to become of Tantal?\nWill it live on for generations to come?\nOr will it wither and die before I do...?
tlk4450018803_ms.json
1	I'm on a break.\nI deserve it - I've been working solidly\nthrough lunchtime.
2	Well now... Time to find out what\neffect this monumental event has on\nour dying relic of a country.
3	Don't answer that. No one can know\nwhat fate has in store for us, after all...
tlk4450018804_ms.json
1	Wonder if you know about the large\nicicles in Colt Ravine?
2	They're known for falling and causing\navalanches.
3	There was one just 3 years ago.\nAnother when I was just a boy. I lost\nmy grandpa in it.
4	It'd be better if someone could knock\n'em down, so they wouldn't pose such\na risk, but...
5	the Tantalese army doesn't have any\nmanpower to spare.
6	We'll just have to wait till they've\ntaken care of what they need to.
7	Oh, you'll have a word with them?
8	Hope now they won't cause any more\nsuffering.
tlk4450018901_ms.json
1	Everything you see here is treasure that\nI personally collected over the years.\nSo go on, take a look!
2	Go on. Take pity on this poor man\nwho finds it hard enough to buy\ntomorrow's groceries.
3	What kind souls! That should help me\nwith living expenses for a while!
4	You becoming an owner has given\nme a new lease on life. Things are\nfinally looking up.
5	Please, take your time, look around.\nYou'll still be paying, naturally.
tlk4451018101_ms.json
1	Long ago, there used to be\na great temple beneath here.\nTheospiti Temple.
2	There's supposedly some kind of Blade\nsealed inside now. I think it's because\nthey went berserk or some such.
3	The legends don't say what ever\nbecame of that Blade, though.
4	And now that the temple itself has\nfallen into ruin, that history is lost\nto us forever...
tlk4451018102_ms.json
1	Ohhh, I can scarcely contain my anger!\nNot the direct descendants of Addam?\nPah! Fie on them!
2	Soon all of this will fade into obscurity,\njust like Theospiti Temple.
3	The story of the Blade sealed away\ninside the temple...Addam's great and\nnumerous exploits... All of it, gone!
4	O Addam...\nPlease...grant us the fortitude to make\nit through these dark times...
tlk4451018103_ms.json
1	Only the Prince's Blade can control\nGenbu's course and bearing.
2	It was meant to stay submerged for\nas long as was safe, but...
3	I have to wonder if something's\nhappened to the Omega Fetter...
4	Ah, but listen to me blab!\nWe shouldn't be here dithering while\nthe evacuation is underway.
tlk4451018201_ms.json
1	I imagine this must be intriguing to\nyou travelers. Ether from the Titan\nflows inside here.
2	You can feel the energy just by\nstanding here, see? Isn't it warm?
3	I make it my daily routine to offer up\nprayers to the Titan daily for the\nbounty it bestows upon us.
4	And of course to Addam our ancestor,\nfor the peace he brought to us all.
tlk4451018202_ms.json
1	I don't know what the outlanders will\nthink of all this... Will they forgive us?\nOr will they never trust us again?
2	Apparently the Tantalese royal family\nwas never descended from Addam...\nIt was all a lie.
3	Everyone seems dismayed by the news,\nbut I'm not actually all that bothered.
4	Whether Addam was our ancestor or\nnot, my prayers to him are still sincere.\nI still believe they reach him somehow...

1	Tantal's staple food is our very own\nhomemade porridge. Eat up!
2	Why, Owner, you came here especially\nto eat some porridge? I'm flattered!
3	They're healthy, hearty and it'll warm\nyou up from the inside out! Believe me,\nyou'll be hooked!
tlk4460018201_ms.json
1	How unusual to see anyone from the\noutside. This seems promising...
tlk4460018301_ms.json
1	Welcome! Tantal is famous for\nour carefully handwoven textiles.\nDon't be shy, take a good look!
2	If you're interested, you should take\na look at the shop next door too.\nMy daughter runs that one.
3	Hello there, Owner!\nTaken an eye to Tantal's fine fabrics,\nhave you?
4	Ah, you're an Owner!\nPlease don't forget to have a look at\nmy daughter's shop on the other side!
tlk4460018401_ms.json
1	I haven't seen you around here before.\nYou must be new...
2	I'm always borrowing books from the\nLibrary Philosofia. That's not to say\nI especially "like" them...
3	It's just the only thing I'm able to\nreally do around here, what with the\ncost of living these days...
4	Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of my\ncountry, but the outlook is so bleak,\nbooks are my only means of escape.
tlk4460018402_ms.json
1	*sigh*\nDid you want something? Sorry, I've\nbeen awfully worried lately...
2	I dread to think what might happen to\nTantal... I'm so sick with worry, I can't\neven concentrate on reading right now.
3	May Addam protect us...
tlk4460018403_ms.json
1	I haven't seen you around here before.\nOutlanders, are you? Well, good call\ncoming here to the black market.
2	This shop only opens at night, and\nsells all sorts of things you won't find\nthrough official shopping channels.
3	The quality's not especially great, but\nyou can find some real bargains here.\nIt really is such a help.
4	
tlk4460018404_ms.json
1	You're outlanders, are you?\nWe're getting more of you these days.\nGood call coming to the black market.
2	This shop only opens at night, and\nsells all sorts of things you won't find\nthrough official shopping channels.
3	The quality didn't used to be so good,\nbut thanks to all the foreign trade, the\nselection is actually quite decent now!
tlk4510011101_ms.json
1	I just thought of something cool.
2	Drivers and Blades are always\ntogether, right?
3	Doesn't that mean they can play\nhide-and-seek whenever they want?!
4	I'm so gonna become a Driver!
tlk4510011102_ms.json
1	I'm studying to become a Driver.
2	I know the most important thing is\nwhether you have the potential, but\nI figure it can't hurt to be prepared.
3	Did you know when your Affinity with\nyour Blade gets high, you can use these\npowerful special attacks?
4	Urk... I guess that's pretty basic stuff.
5	How about this, then?
6	If you touch a Core Crystal that's been\ncleansed in Indol, you're more likely to\nsucceed than with one that hasn't been!
tlk4510011103_ms.json
1	Wow, you guys have so many Blades.
2	That's amazing.
3	I bet it'd be super fun if you all\nplayed hide-and-seek together!
4	I guess there wouldn't even be enough\nroom here in Goldmouth!
5	You'd have to go to, like, Gormott\nor Mor Ardain and play there!
6	You should totally call me if you\never give it a try. I bet I could stay\nhidden for a whole week!
tlk4510012101_ms.json
1	My mam's always so strict, and she's\nobsessed with winning! She doesn't\nbelieve losing is ever an option!
2	That's why she taught me some\ntricks to win in a fight, in case I\never get into one.
3	First of all, Break the enemy's stance!
4	Then knock them over to Topple them!
5	Once you do that, none of your\nattacks will miss, so you can beat\nthe heck out of them!
6	'Course, I've never actually got into\na fight with Leif, so I haven't tested\nit out for myself...
tlk4510012102_ms.json
1	Hey, did you know my mam's a Driver?\nNot to mention a perfectionist.\nShe doesn't believe in losing.
2	That's why she teaches me stuff in\ncase I become a Driver too someday.
3	Like Driver Skills! Apparently once you\nlearn one, it activates automatically.
4	I guess it's like, your body remembers\nthe motions so well you can move\nwithout thinking?
5	Just between you and me, though...\nI don't think I want to become a Driver.\nWatching my mam, it looks so stressful.
tlk4510012103_ms.json
1	Even after our bug-catching showdown,\nme and Leif have been facing off at all\nsorts of other things!
2	Though we don't go anywhere near\ndangerous places any more, of course.
3	Anyway, at the moment I've won ten\ntimes out of ten! I haven't lost once!
4	Yeah! I guess I really am my mam's son.\nI don't believe in losing!
tlk4510012201_ms.json
1	Lunana Smoothies are so delicious...
2	I love playing games with Petir!\nThough that might be because\nI always win, haha!
3	My dad's going to Uraya soon, so I'm\ngonna ask him to buy us a new game\nthere! Bet you're jealous, huh?
tlk4510014101_ms.json
1	I can't thank the mercenaries here\nenough. Thanks to them, me and my\ndad can live in peace!
2	My dad's a scientist. He was being\nchased by Urayan soldiers - they\nwanted him to help develop weapons.
3	They almost caught us, but the\nmercenaries from here showed up\nand saved us!
4	They even gave us a place to live and\nfood to eat...they're such great people!
tlk4510014102_ms.json
1	I dunno who invented those artificial\nBlades, but I feel sorry for them.
2	Having their creation stolen by Torna\nand used as a terrible weapon...
3	Inventors always have a hard time of it.\nMy dad, the guy who invented artificial\nBlades - all of them!
4	It makes me sad that great skills\nbring trouble instead of respect.\nSometimes the world just isn't fair.
tlk4510014103_ms.json
1	What's going to happen to us all?
2	Is Uraya going to be destroyed too?\nOr even all of Alrest?
3	I don't want it to all be over yet...\nI never even invented anything myself!\nI want to be a scientist like my dad!
4	There are so many things I still\nwant to do...
5	Thanks. I'm counting on you guys!\nSomehow I'm sure you can save me,\nmy dad...everybody!
tlk4510015101_ms.json
1	These are rare and unusual junk items\nthat we've gathered from all over.
2	You might find something that's useful\nto you. If you do, be sure to buy it -\nI don't need folk wasting my time.
tlk4510015201_ms.json
1	Have you ever seen Emperor Niall?
2	He's not much older than me, but\nhe rules over all of Mor Ardain.
3	Only thing I ever looked after is\nmy pet Pilehorn Rhino Beetle...
4	But this guy's looking after a whole\ncountry! Isn't that amazing?
5	I just wish my mom would stop\ncomparing me to him...
tlk4510015202_ms.json
1	Emperor Niall always has this Blade\ncalled Aegaeon by his side.
2	He always looks so cool and collected,\nno matter what happens. He's the best!
3	He's gotta be the greatest Blade\nin all of Mor Ardain, right?
4	No, hang on... Wasn't it Brighid that's\nthe strongest in all of Mor Ardain...?
5	Well, whatever! The two of them should\nhave a fight to settle it once and for all.\nI'd pay to see that!
tlk4510015203_ms.json
1	I found a Cubic Diamond in a storage\nwarehouse at the old factory.
2	I gave it to my mom as a present,\nbut she slapped me... Said I shouldn't\nbe going to such dangerous places.
3	But then she smiled and said I was\na brave and kind boy! Worthy of\nEmperor Niall himself, she said!
4	So I've decided. Next, I'm gonna\ngo to the Old City of Teddim and\nfind an Amber Leaf!
tlk4510015204_ms.json
1	I was raising this pet Pilehorn Rhino\nBeetle I found in an old factory, but\nit died recently...
2	So now I'm raising this Tender Shark\nI caught at the Nopon Pioneers' Spring!
3	He's a lovely little guy. Looks after all\nthe other fish for me. As long as there's\nseaweed, I don't even have to feed him!
tlk4510025101_ms.json
1	Hey listen, me and my mum and dad\nare all moving to Indol soon!
2	Hmm... I wonder if you can get Cloud\nSea Crab Sticks in Indol too?
3	Having to leave all my friends behind\nis bad, but having to leave my favorite\nfoods behind would be even worse...
4	Hey, I know!
5	I heard when a country's business is\nbooming, they trade more with other\nplaces and you can get imported goods!
6	So we just have to buy lots of stuff\nand make business in Indol do great!
tlk4510025201_ms.json
1	Don't worry, I'm OK...just about.
2	I got separated from my\nmum and dad, though...
3	I think they probably escaped\non a different Titan ship.
4	Our old house is gone already,\nso I guess I'll just wait here and\nhope my parents show up...

1	Hey, aren't Blades the coolest thing\neverrrr?!
2	They're all like kapooow and use all\nthose flashy weapons, and they fight\nwith the power of friendship!
3	When I grow up, I wanna be a Driver\ntoo!
4	Then I can get my own Blade and\nwe can be a team and it'll be the\nbest thing everrrr!!!
tlk4520011102_ms.json
1	The heart of the Driver decides what\nBlade comes out of a Core Crystal.\nDid you know that?!
2	It's not just stuff like weapons and\nelements that change, nu-uh!
3	Even the way they grow changes!\nThere are like, as many different\nBlades as there are people!
4	Oh, oh, and if you keep trying to bond\nover and over, then sooner or later,\nyou'll meet a super awesome Blade!
5	Admit it, you're impressed, right?
tlk4520011103_ms.json
1	Whoaaa!
2	You're friends with so many Blades!
3	I heard something super interesting\nwhen me and my mum went along\nto Rumbletum Canteen...
4	There's a very bad person somewhere\naround here. I think they called him\na "cork wristel hunter"?
5	I was kinda far away, so I couldn't\nhear so well.
6	I dunno the details exactly, but it\nsounds pretty exciting! You should go\nto Rumbletum Canteen and find out!
tlk4520011104_ms.json
1	I don't like the war. It doesn't make\nany sense.
2	It just makes everybody be horrible\nto everybody else...
3	Grandma says there's nothing better\nthan a world at peace!
4	I wish grown-ups would just stop\nfighting...
tlk4520011105_ms.json
1	I saw the World Tree light up like\na big bright lamp!
2	It happened just when Mr. Titan went\npast it. I wonder if that happens every\ntime?
3	If a huge tree like that fell over, the\nfunny creatures in the Cloud Sea\nwould get a really big surprise, huh!
4	But Mummy said it's a really sturdy\ntree and that it's not gonna fall over\nany time soon. I sure hope so...
tlk4520014101_ms.json
1	Welcome to Sadecott Groceries!
2	All our food uses only the freshest\ncrops grown right here in Garfont!\nCare to try some?
3	Good to see you, owner!\nI'm glad you like this little shop.
tlk4520015101_ms.json
1	Pleasure to see you!\nIf it's Aux Cores you're after,\nyou've come to the right place!
2	The owner isn't around right now,\nbut don't worry! I can handle\neverything by myself!
tlk4520015201_ms.json
1	Um, fresh fish, anyone?\nGenuine tasty Ardainian fish!\nGet them while they're fresh!
2	Oh, hi there, owner!\nWhat are you after today?
tlk4520015301_ms.json
1	Alba Cavanich is a pretty big city, right?
2	The buildings are pretty huge, and\nthere are all kinds of different shops.\nApparently folk who visit get lost a lot.
3	Shops are on the central main street.\nThis way's all houses and warehouses,\nand down the opposite way's the inn.
4	But if you really get lost, it helps\nto get up on the roofs. Good view\nfrom up there!
tlk4520015302_ms.json
1	Alba Cavanich is the biggest city\nin the whole Empire.
2	Watching from here, you see all sorts\nof people and goods coming in and\ngoing out of the city.
3	I guess nobody can tell if there are bad\npeople in among the crowd. Like the\nones who caused a ruckus not long ago.
4	If only all bad people were as easy to\nspot as that Brionac lot.
5	Oh, Brionac's an evil organization that\nEmperor Niall's trying to defeat.
tlk4520015303_ms.json
1	We almost ended up at war with Uraya,\nbut thanks to Emperor Niall it all\nworked out fine in the end!
2	My mom and dad were pretty relieved.
3	By the way, why would we have to\nfight with Uraya anyway?
4	They don't seem all that bad to me...
tlk4520015304_ms.json
1	Everyone's saying the Mor Ardain Titan\nisn't going to be alive for much longer.
2	Mor Ardain's a big place... Apart from\nAlba Cavanich, there are cities around\nits right shoulder and belly as well.
3	We can't all move to Gormott at once,\nand apparently they don't even have\nenough houses there for everyone...
4	Apparently nobody was expecting the\nTitan's life to end so soon.
5	D'you think we're all done for?\nIs there nothing anyone can do...?
6	Thanks. If there's anything you can do,\nplease try to help everyone!
tlk4520015310_ms.json
1	H-hey! You look like you can handle\nyourselves in a fight! C-could you\nmaybe help me out with something?
2	I-it's the back alleys...\nThey're haunted by a gh...a gh...
3	Oh come on, do I have to say it?!\nIt's a gh-gh-gh-ghost!
4	I was hiding in the back alley during a\ngame of hide-and-seek, and I heard\nthis voice like a woman crying!
5	It's not just me, either!\nMy little sister saw this shadow like a\nwoman with long black hair!
6	Don't you think that's scary?!
7	What, really? You'll help?! It might be\na real gh-gh-gh-ghost, you know?
8	All right... I'll leave it to you, then!\nJust make sure you don't get\np-possessed or anything!

2	Apparently he doesn't need to move\nto Uraya any more, either! It looks like\na lot of crazy stuff happened...
3	But the important thing is, he really\nliked the pendant! He said it cheered\nhim up, even!
tlk4530001101_ms.json
1	So it was Torna who Chairman Bana\nwas working for?
2	That bunch get up to some crazy\nmischief, I tell you. You never know\nwhat they're thinking.
3	But hey, I'm just happy that the\nMaelstrom and its crew came\nback safely.
tlk4530001102_ms.json
1	You know you can retake the same\nMerc Mission even after you've\nfinished it?
2	I guess it makes sense. I'd never turn\ndown a little extra help with making\ndeliveries myself!
3	And then there's stuff like guard duty\nwhere they need somebody on the job\npretty much constantly.
4	If you've got some Blades to spare,\ngive them some Merc Missions to do.\nBetter than having them laze around!
tlk4530001103_ms.json
1	I've been up to my eyeballs in work\nlately. Haven't been giving my girl\nthe attention she deserves.
2	She almost flipped her lid at me\nthe other day. I've never seen her\ndo that before.
3	I thought I might buy her some Samod\non the way home. She loves Samod.
4	It's got to be something different\nfrom the norm, though. She's a\nbit avant-garde in that respect.
tlk4530001104_ms.json
1	So I bought some Tasty Kordeth Samod\nfor my girlfriend on the way home.
2	One bite of it and she was back\nto her old chirpy self!
3	She probably found it a refreshing\nnew taste, 'cos she'd never eaten\nanything from Tantal before.
4	Kordeth's a type of sausage, you\nknow. I tried a bit myself too, and\nit really is good stuff!
5	There's this succulent juiciness when\nyour teeth sink in. It really works well\nin Samod.
6	Best part is, trying out new food gave\nus something fun to talk about!
7	Ahh, I'm so glad that Argentum's\nmanaged to expand its trade with\nall these countries...
tlk4530001105_ms.json
1	Could I ask a favor of you?
2	Thing is, we just received a huge\ndelivery from Mor Ardain.
3	It's much bigger than usual, so we're\nbehind schedule handling it all.
4	That's why I need your help.
5	If any of those Blades you've got thinks\nthey're strong enough, could they help\nout with lugging the stuff?
6	Thanks for the help.
7	Might even be able to make up\nfor lost time if things go well.
tlk4530001201_ms.json
1	I can't get over the fact that you're\nproviding for your village at such a\nyoung age, Rex. It's really admirable.
2	You're probably heading out for\na bit of salvaging after this, aren't you?
3	Well, be careful how you go.
4	Come to me whenever you need to\nsend some cash back to Fonsett.
5	I'll be right here.
tlk4530001202_ms.json
1	So you've set up a direct\ntrade route to Fonsett.
2	Good thing as well. Saves a lot of\nmoney in the long run, being able\nto cut out the middleman.
3	Makes me feel bad about what\nI've been doing.
4	I never realized we were charging\nso much for the service fee.
5	Sorry about that.
6	If there's any way I can help you with\nmanaging the service, anything at all,\njust give me a shout.

5	Pay
6	Don't pay

8	Enjoy your stay on Goldmouth, yeah?
9	Whaaaaat?!\nYou just came by to taunt me,\nis that it?
10	Come on, you're a salvager, I know\nyou can afford a measly 15G!
11	Rex, you've got a lot to be proud of.
12	Salvaging isn't exactly a stable career.
13	Some days you might hit the jackpot,\nbut on an unlucky day you might not\nbring in a single G.
14	Living independently at your age in a\nbusiness like that...it can't be easy.
15	You just keep up the good work, yeah?

3	Seems a lot cuter than I recall, too.\nThe stern old face I remember could've\npassed for a monster!
4	You two must've been through some\ncrazy stuff. Pretty sure you weren't a\nDriver last I saw you either, eh, Rex?

1	You know Ardainians are the next\nmost common race in Argentum\nafter the Nopon, right?
2	There are quite a few people like me\nwho were born in Mor Ardain but\nchoose to live here instead.
3	Main reason for that is, Mor Ardain's\nTitan isn't an easy place to live.
4	The ground is barren, and not many\ncrops grow there.
5	Some choose to move to Gormott too,\nbut I went for Argentum since there\nare more working opportunities.
6	Though I guess the bigger reason is that\nI failed to get into the Ardainian army.

4	Even when you visited Goldmouth, the\nonly folk you knew were guys like me\nand Pupunin, the Nopon and the kids.
5	I'm kind of jealous of how far you've\ncome. Maybe I should try and become\na Driver myself, hahah!
6	...Yeah, that's probably not happening.\nThe one time I touched a Core Crystal,\nI passed out for five days.

4	But now this Torna lot have shown up\nin Torigoth... Apparently they even got\naway from Special Inquisitor Mòrag.

1	You don't hear much about those\nCore Crystal hunters lately.
2	I wonder if they gave up after\nSpecial Inquisitor Mòrag put the\nfear of the Architect into them!
3	I don't know if anything came of the\nrumors Torna was behind it, either.\nJust what were they after?
tlk4530002106_ms.json
1	You know that pair of Blades who were\nworking as dirty Core Crystal hunters?
2	I heard they've been taken in by\nnew Drivers and are using their\npowers for good now.
3	If they're not evil any more,\nI'd kind of like to meet them.
4	Just to see what kind of Blades\nwere causing my bro and the Military\nEngineer Corps so much grief!
5	What?! These two?!
6	I'm...sorry for running my mouth\noff like that.
7	You do seem like good people now.\nI can feel an air of honesty around you.
8	I guess it's true that Blades are\nstrongly affected by their Drivers.
9	You two should count yourselves\nlucky to have found such good Drivers\nthis time around!
tlk4530004201_ms.json
1	Popoh feeling especially nice\nand fluffy today!
2	If anyone come back from mission,\nPopoh be first to greet!
3	Feeling fluffy-fluffy fur of Popoh\nsurely ease their tense spirits!

1	...\n...Oh, hello. Sorry, I was so absorbed\nin this book I didn't notice you.
2	...Oh...\nThe owner...\nIt's all yours...
tlk4530005301_ms.json
1	Hey! How d'you feel about some meaty\ndishes from a former military man?\nBest way to build a strong body!
2	Hey there, owner!\nStopping by for a bite to eat?\nGood food for a strong body!
tlk4530005401_ms.json
1	The majority of Mor Ardain's buildings\nare built from salvaged machinery and\nprocessed ores and minerals.
2	We also make extensive use of\ngeothermally-powered steam engines.
3	It's no exaggeration to say that this is\nthe most technologically advanced city\nin all of Alrest.
4	As a mechanic in such an advanced\ncity, I often have to climb onto the\nroofs to maintain all that machinery.
5	Sometimes I worry what would happen\nif I fell off.
tlk4530005402_ms.json
1	Did you hear about the ruckus\nthat happened the other night?
2	Apparently there was some kind of\nchase. The military and some mystery\nindividuals, leaping across the rooftops.
3	I heard there was some scary stuff\ngoing down in Gormott, but I never\ndreamed it would happen here.
4	Peace has reigned for a while now,\nbut maybe times are starting to take\na turn for the worse...
5	At any rate, I don't know how they\nmanaged it, leaping about such\nprecarious places.
6	I'd probably get a heart attack\njust thinking about it.
tlk4530005403_ms.json
1	The Mor Ardain Titan's life is running\nout, everybody knows it.
2	My dad tells me that when he was\na boy, there was much less steam\nhanging in the air around here.
3	As a Titan's death draws closer,\nthe surface temperature of its body\nstarts to rise.
4	Apparently it's hotter this month\nthan it was the last, even.
5	You have to wonder how much longer\nthis whole place will hold out.
tlk4530005404_ms.json
1	I can't believe it...\nHow could they make Mor Ardain's\nTitan do something so reckless?
2	Little cracks are starting to show all\nover Alba Cavanich, and it's taking\neverything I have to fix them all.
3	Apparently they even picked up\nsome worrying readings at the\nGeothermal Mining Plant.
4	It looks like things may have calmed\ndown for now, but how much longer\ncan the Titan really hold up?
tlk4530005410_ms.json
1	Well... My life is officially over.
2	I keep telling him that I can't deal\nwith heights, but the foreman gives\nme these ridiculous jobs anyway.
3	He's only told me to take care of\nthe gondola maintenance inspection!
4	How am I meant to carry out repairs\nall the way up there?! I'd pass out\nfrom the sheer terror of it!
5	Really? You'd do this for me?\nYou must be the kindest people\nI've ever met!
6	Thank you so much!\nYou're lifesavers, you really are!
tlk4530005801_ms.json
1	Welcome to the Smaia Clinic.\nFrom little scratches to rare sicknesses,\nwe'll patch you up in a jiffy!
2	Actually, I'm just an assistant.\nDoctor Smaia is out gathering\ningredients for a new medicine...
3	If you ever find a patient who no other\ndoctor can handle, come and see us!\nWe take on the toughest cases!
tlk4530005802_ms.json
1	A Flesh Eater... I always thought\nthey were nothing but a myth.
2	To think that they actually exist!\nI'd love to set eyes on one someday.
tlk4530005803_ms.json
1	Doctor Smaia suddenly declared she's\nleaving the clinic to me, then went\nrushing off without another word.
2	I mean, I'm sure I can handle things\non my own. I've watched the Doctor\nat work for many years.
3	But a lot of our regular patients\nare saying they're going to miss\nDoctor Smaia's brusque attitude.
4	Perhaps I should mimic her way\nof talking? Do you think?
tlk4530005804_ms.json
1	I wonder what's going to happen to\nMor Ardain from now on...
2	There's no telling what might happen,\nreally. Maybe we should make sure our\nmedicine stocks are fully replenished.
3	That might take a while, though,\ngiven how the Doctor goes about\ncollecting ingredients...

1	Just take a look at this view!\nIsn't it spectacular? You can see\nthe head of Indol so clearly!
2	Standing here, I feel almost like I've\nbecome a bird, gliding across the\nwide Cloud Sea below.
3	You should try this too sometime, you\nknow - find a high point that juts out,\nand toss some money into the clouds.
4	They say if you throw money into the\nCloud Sea from high above, your wish\nwill come true! I sure hope mine does.
tlk4530007102_ms.json
1	I overheard the soldiers discussing\nsomething about Mor Ardain and Uraya.
2	I'm Ardainian myself, but I'm not\ntoo thrilled with the way our military\ngoes about things.
3	That refugee camp's full of people who\nlost their homes in the territorial war\nMor Ardain waged on Gormott, isn't it?
4	All I can do is stand here tossing\nmoney down and praying for peace.

1	Now this is interesting!
2	It's really been worth it coming all this\nway to Indol!
3	I've been studying the lifeforms in the\nCloud Sea around Indol, and I've found\nsomething interesting.
4	Currently, small creatures from other\ncountries...
5	are growing to a size so large that\nthey might be classified as giant\nspecies.
6	It's true! It's true!
7	This is the first time I've seen this\nkind of thing too!
8	I'd love to continue the study, but\nmy professor in Mor Ardain is waiting\nfor my report...
9	You'll take my report to Mor Ardain\nfor me? That's great!
10	You're very generous folk! I'm quite\ntouched by your kindness!
11	Well, I really should crack on with\nmy study.
12	Thanks for taking the report!

4	For the finishing blow,\nSmash 'em to the ground!
5	[ML:Feeling ]That's what I teach 'em, but they're\nnot always too quick on the uptake.
6	It's tough to link up attacks like that on\nyour own, so you gotta work with your\nallies. Takes 'em a while to realize that.
tlk4530014302_ms.json
1	Tell me, rookie.
2	Do you find yourself using the\nsame Blade all the time?
3	This mercenary band's a lot bigger than\nit used to be. I'm sure you've got a fair\nnumber of Blades working for you.
4	I'd advise you to spend time\nadventuring with as many Blades\nas you can manage.
5	That's the best way to grow\nas a Driver.
tlk4530014303_ms.json
1	A mercenary never knows when\ndeath is gonna claim him.
2	I guess even the leader of the Garfont\nMercenaries is no exception.
3	Vandham was a fine man, a strong\nfighter and a charismatic leader,\nbut death came for him all the same.
4	You think you have time to hang around\nfeeling depressed? If you're gonna fill\nhis shoes, you've got work to do!
5	That goes for all of us. All we can do\nnow is to keep moving forward.
tlk4530014305_ms.json
1	The Urayan Titan shook like it's\nnever shaken before.
2	Who could've dreamed the day would\ncome when all the Titans would gather\naround the World Tree?
3	Could this be the end of Alrest,\nor something more...?
4	At any rate, you can leave Garfont\nto me. I'll keep it safe!
5	I was a renowned Driver myself,\nin my day, you know!
6	And after all these years of rest, I'm\nfeeling about ready for a punch-up!
7	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]!
8	[ML:Feeling ]Only problem is, I don't have\na Blade to fight with...
tlk4530014306_ms.json
1	Thanks to your help, this band has\ngrown larger than ever.
2	Now we've got everything well sorted\nout, it might be time we tried organizing\nmock battles with other merc bands.
3	You think our men are going to grow\nstrong just from doing push-ups and\npractice swings in the training ground?
4	Facing enemies in a proper combat\nsituation is the trigger the men need\nto take a good hard look at themselves.
5	We've already picked out a team\nfor you to face. You'll help us out,\nwon't you?
6	'Course, if we're gonna do this thing,\nboth sides should aim for nothing less\nthan victory! Don't you half-arse it.
tlk4530015701_ms.json
1	This is Smùide Plant. Entry is forbidden\nto all but authorized personnel.
2	This plant is where we convert the\nheat from inside the Titan into energy\nfor our steam engines.
3	You could call it the foundation of\nthe Ardainian Empire's technology.
4	It's connected to the plant outside the\ncity by gondola, but don't you dare\ntry anything funny, hear?
tlk4530015702_ms.json
1	There was some kind of ruckus near\nhere during the night, you know?
2	I was pretty scared this place\nmight be attacked.
3	This facility is the most important place\nin the city after Hardhaigh Palace itself.
4	If it were to go down, basically all the\ncity's functions would become useless.
5	We have to keep a tight guard on it.
tlk4530015703_ms.json
1	The surface temperature of Mor Ardain\nhas been slowly but surely rising lately.
2	Smùide Plant has been around ever\nsince the capital was first moved here\nto Hardhaigh...
3	In the past century, we've recorded\nan overall temperature increase of\n6 points.
4	In Gormott for comparison, we only\nhave data for the last decade, but the\ntemperature rose by just 0.01 points.
5	So you can see why the Empire might\nbe in a hurry to expand their territory.
tlk4530015704_ms.json
1	The temperature of the Mor Ardain\nTitan suddenly jumped upwards.
2	Frankly, we're lucky this facility wasn't\ncompletely blasted away. It's starting to\nstabilize again now, thankfully.
3	We may have the technology to make\nuse of the energy the Titan creates, but\nthat doesn't mean we can control it.
4	In the end, we're at the mercy of\nthe Titan's biology...
5	All we can do is pray that the Titan\nholds out a bit longer.
tlk4530045101_ms.json
1	Say, are those Blades I see traveling\nwith you? That brings back memories...
2	My old man's a Driver too, you know.\nHis Blade was basically like a\nmother to me.
3	She used to make me dumplings,\nplay with me, help with my education...
4	I hope she's doing all right these days.\nMy old man, too...
tlk4530045102_ms.json
1	Hey there.
2	I knew on some level this might happen\nfrom the day I first decided to leave\nhim behind and make a life of my own...
3	But it still hurts that I didn't get to see\nmy old man again before he died.
4	You were there for his last moments,\nweren't you?
5	I hope he was happy, at least...
6	My dad's real home was here, in Alba\nCavanich. To tell the truth, I was hoping\nI could bring him back here someday.
tlk4530045103_ms.json
1	Thanks for what you did before.
2	Being able to see Vess again, it really\nhelped ease my heart a little.
3	Me and my sister didn't become\nDrivers because our old man\nwarned us against it.
4	I'm just glad she found a good Driver\nto work for now that he's gone.\nThat's what he'd have wanted.
5	I probably don't need to tell you this,\nbut...take good care of Vess, yeah?
tlk4531011103_ms.json
1	That was a terrible ordeal back\nthere... I'm just glad we got out\nof it in one piece.
2	D'you think Chairman Bana didn't know\nthose people were members of Torna?
3	I hope he'll investigate his clients more\nclosely before taking on jobs in future...
4	Those guys weren't normal, I tell you.\nIt's a miracle that we escaped alive!
tlk4531011104_ms.json
1	Apparently the Maelstrom isn't going\nto be setting sail any time soon.
2	Normally I'd gather up a crew, take\nthis ship out to a distant quadrant and\ntry to haul up some big prize.
3	But I guess it's not so bad to go out\nsalvaging on my own once in a while.
4	Takes me back to simpler days when\nI'd go out, collect a bunch of treasures\nand be thrilled at every G I earned!
tlk4531011105_ms.json
1	I guess it's true that going out\non a journey builds character.
2	I mean, Rex, I still think of you as\na rookie salvager...
3	But these days you're in a whole\ndifferent line of business, and doing\nwell for yourself as a Driver to boot.
4	Wouldn't be surprised if you could\nteach those Torna goons a thing or two.
5	I feel like there's this strong bond\nbetween you and your friends,\nBlades and otherwise.
6	All that business on the ancient ship\nwas just a horrible ordeal for me, but\nI guess for you it was something more.
tlk4531015801_ms.json
1	At the top of this elevator is\nAlba Cavanich, the imperial capital.
2	You can buy top quality Core Chips and\naccessories there, made using cutting-\nedge Ardainian technology.
3	Any Driver would be a fool not to\npay the place a visit at least once.
4	Also, most food in the Empire is pretty\nawful, but there's something called\nQuoteletta that's actually worth a try.
5	Stay away from this stuff they call\nKascha, though. It's a kind of gruel, but\nthe things they put in it are just...eurgh.
tlk4531015802_ms.json
1	It's not as developed as in Uraya,\nbut Mor Ardain has its share of\nmercenary-type work as well.
2	'Course, unlike in Uraya, you're not\nlikely to see the army handing out\nmissions to mercs around here.
3	And we don't have actual organized\nmercenary bands. Most you'll generally\nfind is teams of a few people.
4	As a rule, mercenary work around here\nis more of an ad-hoc, solo affair.
5	That said, there's plenty of requests\nfrom the general populace. The sorts of\nlittle things the army wouldn't handle.
6	So guys like me can make a\ndecent living! Hahahah!
tlk4531015803_ms.json
1	Hey, have you heard of the Garfont\nMercenaries from Uraya?
2	They're a tough bunch, I can\ntell you that for free.
3	Lately they keep taking on all the\njobs round here. Solving everyone's\nproblems in the blink of an eye.
4	Us locals have gotta step up our game\nif we want to stay competitive!
5	All the mercenaries in Mor Ardain\nright now are burning to show those\ninterlopers what's what.
tlk4531015804_ms.json
1	Lately no matter where you go,\nthere's one name you always hear:\nthe Garfont Mercenaries.
2	If you've got a problem, leave it to the\nGarfont Mercenaries, everyone says.
3	Worst part is, I can't even argue.\nThey DO solve pretty much any\nproblem, and efficiently at that.
4	I shudder to think how many Blades\nthey must have working for them.\nPowerful ones they must be, too.
5	Maybe it's time I headed to Uraya\nmyself and asked if they wouldn't\nlet me join up.
6	The days of solo mercenary work might\nbe coming to an end. From here on out,\nmaybe it's best we all work together.
tlk4531034101_ms.json
1	Welcome to Garfont.
2	That's the name of the mercenary band\nVandham runs, and it's also what we\ncall this village where we all live.
3	As you can see, we take all sorts here.\nMercenaries and Drivers from all over\nAlrest, and plenty of kids too.
4	Naturally, you're welcome here as well.
tlk4531034102_ms.json
1	The Garfont Mercenaries take on\njobs anywhere in Alrest.
2	Me and my sister joined up after\nVandham saved our asses on a\nmission one time.
3	I still haven't come close to paying\nhim back for that...
4	Never dreamed he'd be gone\nbefore I got the chance.
5	Zuo and Yew are working hard to pick\nup the slack, but who knows what'll\nbecome of the Garfont Mercenaries...
tlk4531034103_ms.json
1	You're starting to get the look of\na veteran mercenary about you.
2	Hahah, I'm just kidding.\nYou're not that rugged yet.
3	But you are doing a fine job of\nleading the Garfont Mercenaries.\nVandham would be proud.
4	The bigger our mercenary band\ngets, the more Blades you can\nmanage at once.
5	'Course, you can still only take three\nper Driver around with you at a time,\nbut it's good to have plenty in reserve!
6	So if I were you, I'd try to build\nthe Garfont Mercenaries up to be\nas big as you can.
7	As big as old Vandham's body, even!\nHahahah!
tlk4531034104_ms.json
1	Hey, did you notice something?
2	The bigger this mercenary band gets,\nthe more people come to Garfont.
3	We're getting more and more new\nblood in our ranks!
4	If you see any of the new rookies\naround, say hi, why don't you?
tlk4531034105_ms.json
1	Hey, did you hear?
2	The Garfont Mercenaries have\ngrown into the biggest mercenary\nband in all of Uraya!
3	All of Alrest, even!
4	None of the classic mercenary groups\nfull of rich folk with noble blood can\nmatch our military strength any more.
5	It's all thanks to you that we've\nmade it this far. So...thanks.
6	Well, you and old Vandham, of course!
tlk4531034106_ms.json
1	Oh, what're we going to do about this?
2	Well, you may not know this, but\nTopprea Ore has suddenly become\nextremely scarce of late.
3	And a lack of supply means\nthe price jumps sky-high!
4	Anyway, the problem is, with the\nvalue riding so high, folk have started\nexcavating the stuff without a license.
5	No matter how many warnings they're\ngiven, they just come back for more\nas soon as they see a chance.
6	So Fonsa Myma have asked us to\ntighten up security.
7	The plan is to start regular patrols, but\nwe're not sure who to put on the job.
8	Oh, you'll organize it for us?\nThat'd be a great help!
9	With you taking care of this, that's\na real load off my mind! Thanks!
tlk4532012101_ms.json
1	The Ardainian army is always eager for\nnew recruits! How about it, kids? Ever\nthought about becoming a Driver?
2	What?! You're already Drivers?!\nEven better! We can get you\nenrolled immediately!
3	Our Drivers aren't expected to be\nbound to any one Blade.
4	All you need is a Core Crystal and you\ncan have a whole bevy of Blades!
5	See what useful information I've\ndivulged? It would be rude to turn\ndown my offer now, surely...
tlk4532012102_ms.json
1	We've been out here trying to recruit\nDrivers for some time now...
2	But I've yet to clap eyes on a Blade\nwith a unique ability!
3	I'm talking about Blades that excel in\nFortitude or Focus, or have a\nspecialized field of knowledge...
4	Seems the chances of meeting\nsuch exceptional individuals are\nfew and far between!
5	But I expect that if you stick it out\nand keep trying, sooner or later you'll\nend up resonating with a winner!
tlk4532012103_ms.json
1	As a Driver scout, I do worry about the\nwelfare of our young recruits!
2	There was a lad who enrolled just\nthe other day, in fact.
3	Jac, I think his name was.
4	Said he wanted to become a Driver\nto help out his siblings. That's some\npassion for you!
5	I hope life's treating him well in\nMor Ardain...
tlk4532012104_ms.json
1	You've got quite the collection of\nBlades there!
2	Are you making efficient use of\nBlade Switching during battle?
3	If you can get to grips with the\nsystem, it'll really open up your\nelemental combo options.
4	Understanding your Blades' traits and\nplanning ahead is half the battle!
5	Whew. It's hard work dishing out\nadvice like this.
6	As a Driver scout, I mostly deal with\ncomplete rookies, and there's no point\ntelling them about advanced strategy.
7	"Focus on the Crystal and try to\nawaken a good Blade!" is about the\nextent of the advice I get to give.
tlk4532012105_ms.json
1	It's precisely because our country is\nin a state of crisis that we need to\nrally the people of Gormott!
2	At this rate, we might have to go from\nhouse to house and indiscriminately\nmake everyone touch Core Crystals!
3	...I actually suggested that to the\nBureau of Internal Affairs, you know.
4	But they told me no, on grounds that\nwe'd end up with a pile of citizens\nlying in pools of their own blood.
5	Which is...a fair point. But seeing the\nstate the world is in, we can't afford to\nhave people sitting doing nothing!
tlk4532012201_ms.json
1	When I was first dispatched to\nTorigoth, I thought it would be a nice,\npeaceful city where the days roll by.
2	But it seems like a lot of the Gormottis\nstill bear a grudge against Mor Ardain...
3	And the other day, we even had\nunauthorized Drivers infiltrating\nour base! Unbelievable...
4	There's no end to our troubles here,\nI'm telling you.
5	Still, it's a far sight better than the\nhome country. Even if we are short\nof a consul...
tlk4532012204_ms.json
1	Seems Aegaeon's not at the\nEmperor's side these days.
2	I heard he has been entrusted to the\nSpecial Inquisitor or some such.
3	I just hope that the Emperor's\nguarded well enough.
4	If anything were to happen to him,\nthat'd be it for Mor Ardain.
5	*shudder* Scary thought. I should ask\nmy dad back home if he knows more.
tlk4532012205_ms.json
1	The refugees from Indol have arrived\nand we're doing what we can in the\nbase to deal with them.
2	From what I heard, Torna attacked\nthem with some Titan-like...thing.
3	Two Titans fighting each other...\nIt's the stuff of nightmares.
4	There's rumors Mor Ardain's moved\nup near the World Tree as well...
5	I'm worried for my dad back in the\nhome country. I hope he'll agree to\nevacuate here too...
tlk4532012206_ms.json
1	Gah... If only there was someone\nwho could help...
2	This is just between you and me...
3	We've received information that the\nrebel group is doing business in\nGormott.
4	We want to catch the ringleaders and\nput a stop to their business activities.
5	If we, the Ardainian army, were\nsent there, they might just stop\ntheir business and vanish.
6	To avoid that we're trying to recruit\ncapable folk with no connection to us\nto take on this mission.
7	But no worthy candidates have\nappeared, yet...
8	What? Really?
9	Now that I know you're on the mission\nI'm feeling hopeful.
10	I heard that some of them are armed.
11	You'd better make good your\npreparations, and take care out there.
tlk4532012301_ms.json
1	Did you know that there are special\nenemies called "unique monsters"?
2	They're supposed to be absurdly\npowerful. Far stronger than your\naverage monster.
3	If you pick a fight with one of them\nunprepared, it'll be curtains for you.\nI've heard some grisly tales...
4	Ahh, the mere thought... *shudder*
5	Don't you go charging in without\nknowing what you're getting yourself\ninto first, do you hear?
tlk4532012302_ms.json
1	I transferred here thinking Gormott\nwas a peaceful place.
2	But now we have to deal with terrorists\neven Lady Mòrag can't catch?! How're\ngrunts like us going to stand a chance?!
3	Torna must be seething after we\ncaught one of their own!
4	What if they're out to exact their\nrevenge?!
5	Even if I wanted to go back to the\nhomeland, with Consul Dughall gone\nthere's nobody to grant approval!
6	I can't take it any more! None of us\nare going to leave this place alive!!!
tlk4532012303_ms.json
1	I can't feel at ease unless I've patrolled\nthe city from perimeter to perimeter.
2	You never know what terrible event\ncould be happening... I'm a nervous\nwreck!
3	Did you hear about those bandits\nwho tried to attack the town?
4	We caught them this time, but\nthat's just the tip of the iceberg,\nyou mark my words.
5	You never know when some other\nlowlife bunch might plan an attack.\nI'm so worried, I have trouble sleeping...
tlk4532012305_ms.json
1	It feels like Alrest's on the brink of\ntotal warfare lately...
2	I can sense it in the air.
3	I think something really terrible's\nabout to happen...
4	I fear for my safety out here. Maybe it's\nabout time I filed a transfer request...
5	No no, I can't. They'll end up putting\nme on the front line!
6	Gah! It doesn't matter where I go! I just\ncan't shake this feeling of unease!
tlk4532012306_ms.json
1	Indol's sunk beneath the Cloud Sea\nand we're being flooded with refugees!
2	We're already seeing scuffles popping\nup between the refugees and the locals\nall around the city center...
3	It's a total shambles! And even if I\nwent back to the homeland, it's on\nthe verge of sinking too! HELP!
4	Somebody... Anybody...\nGet Alrest out of this mess!
5	You're going to help us?!\nOh, yes! Please do, please do!
tlk4532012401_ms.json
1	I hope Lady Mòrag remains stationed\nat Torigoth Relay Station for some\ntime...
2	There's a sense of calm while she's\nhere.
3	Because we know that whatever\nhappens, she'll protect the peace\nin Gormott.
4	Wouldn't be exaggerating to say she's\neveryone's rock and shield...
5	I do hope you'll remain here at\nTorigoth Relay Station for a while,\nLady Mòrag.
6	There's always a sense of calm while\nyou're here.
7	Because we know that whatever\nhappens, you'll protect the peace\nin Gormott.
8	It wouldn't be exaggerating to say\nyou're our rock and shield, ma'am...
tlk4532012402_ms.json
1	We've managed to avoid war with\nUraya, but that doesn't mean we\ncan slack off with our training.
2	In Temperantia for example, the\nGormotti army didn't move, but that\ndoesn't mean they won't next time.
3	Ardainians and Gormotti have to train\nevery day in order to protect this city.\nTrain till we spit blood if needs be...

tlk4532012403_ms.json
1	The refugees from Indol and Mor\nArdain are staying at this Torigoth\nRelay Station for the time being.
2	Large numbers of them turning up in\nTorigoth would only end up causing\ntrouble. And that we don't need!
3	They all seem to be holding up well,\nthough.
tlk4532012404_ms.json
1	Everyone in Torigoth Relay Base, from\nthe veterans down to the new recruits\nis working their guts out.
2	All that training we put in is paying off.
3	Hope we'll be able to get through\nthis crisis and get back to training\nhard again.
tlk4532012601_ms.json
1	The Tirkin that Eyvan brought in\nmake surprisingly effective personnel.
2	They take their guard duties seriously,\nand they always have a good attitude.
3	And their skills with those bows!\nBows are great weapons, you know?\nThey keep costs down so much!
tlk4532015101_ms.json
1	Hardhaigh Palace isn't just the imperial\nresidence, it's also Alba Cavanich's\nbest-defended stronghold.
2	If you visit the uppermost floor, you'll\nbe able to see the gigantic cannonports.
3	The elevators to the left and right will\ntake you up there, if you're interested.
tlk4532015102_ms.json
1	Emperor Niall has returned safely.
2	However...I am quite concerned about\nthe fact that he has lost his faithful\nBlade Aegaeon.
3	It's doubly harder without the counsel\nof his wise sister. But duty to one's\ncountry must come before even family.
4	As the Imperial Guard, we must work\ndoubly hard to ensure His Majesty's\nsafety in these trying times.
tlk4532015103_ms.json
1	At this rate, the Mor Ardain Titan's\nether will soon be exhausted...
2	Yet still His Majesty refuses to\ntake refuge in Gormott.
3	I appreciate why, of course. He cannot\nbring himself to abandon his people,\nand he trusts in all of you implicitly.
4	We feel the same way ourselves.
tlk4532015105_ms.json
1	Unauthorized persons are not permitted\nentry to Hardhaigh Palace.
2	Be on your way.
tlk4532015201_ms.json
1	Welcome to the Empire of Mor Ardain.
2	To reach the capital of Alba Cavanich,\njust follow the path right there.
3	The path terminates in the Cargo\nTransportation Zone. From there, take\nthe elevator to reach the city proper.
tlk4532015202_ms.json
1	I heard about some kind of artificial\nBlade causing chaos in the capital.
2	The gate over there was closed the\nwhole time, so I imagine the Blade\nmust have gone across Midorl Bridge.
3	Honestly, what were the people\nguarding the main gate playing at,\nletting a thing like that get through?
4	...Not that I can talk, after I managed\nto lose the key to the other gate, haha...
tlk4532015203_ms.json
1	The Ardainian Empire is vast and\npowerful, but it is not without its\ninternal struggles.
2	There is an anti-imperial organization\nknown as Brionac.
3	Their goal is to replace His Majesty\nthe Emperor Niall with another of\ntheir choosing.
4	Apparently many soldiers who left the\nImperial Army over the years have\nallied themselves with these people.
5	They even have Titan weapons of\ntheir own. A dangerous lot, to be sure.
tlk4532015204_ms.json
1	The refugees from Indol are being\nhoused in this port for the time being.
2	But the Ardainian Titan too has\ngrown very weak of late.
3	There's no guarantee that anyone\nwill be safe here for long...
4	I just hope they aren't all forced to\nflee to another Titan a second time...
tlk4532015210_ms.json
1	Oh, where am I going to find\na good teacher?
2	Well, my dream is to become a cool\nand powerful Driver like Lady Mòrag.
3	I'd love to be able to wield a Blade as\nmagnificent as Lady Brighid someday!
4	But I don't know anyone with the skills\nto train me to reach that kind of level.
5	I'm looking for a great teacher who\ncould train me to become stronger!
6	Oh, you know someone who\ncould help me?!
7	That's wonderful! You'll have to\nintroduce me to them soon!
tlk4532015301_ms.json
1	Welcome to Bathein Watchtower.
2	This right here may be the best vantage\npoint in all Mor Ardain. You can see the\nwhole of the Titan's right shoulder.
3	When monsters approach, we send 'em\nflying with the cannons in Grian, Wing\nArea #2, which you came here through.
4	It's me and my comrade's job to\nkeep watch every day and make sure\nnothing seems amiss.
5	By the way, that comrade I mentioned\nis always slacking off somewhere.\nSo I basically keep watch on my own.
tlk4532015901_ms.json
1	Not much to see past here.\nIt's all wasteland and power plants.
2	You'll want to watch out for\nmonsters, though.
3	We fend off the monsters out there\nto stop them getting into the city.\nThey're no walk in the park.
4	Even with our advanced Ardainian\nsteam rifles, they don't go down easily.
tlk4532015902_ms.json
1	You must be the Drivers whom\nSpecial Inquisitor Mòrag spoke of.
2	Sorry to disappoint, but I'm not aware\nof any suspicious goods passing\nthrough here in the past few days.
3	All the goods I've seen go through have\nbeen completely ordinary. Though we\nhaven't been inspecting all that closely.
4	What we have been on the lookout\nfor is that mechanical Blade.
5	That's why we found her so quickly\nthat night. Though she wound up\ngiving us a thrashing.
tlk4532015903_ms.json
1	To reach the factory, you'll want to\nhead down a side path on the left,\nthrough the Old Industrial District.
2	The factory and that whole district\nhave been out of use for a long time,\nso they may be infested with monsters.
tlk4532015904_ms.json
1	I think the most important military\ninnovation Mor Ardain has produced\nto date is the steam rifle.
2	Apparently they were inspired by,\nand to an extent based upon, certain\nlong-range weapons used by Blades.
3	But whatever their origins, they allow\nalmost anyone to hold their own in\ncombat, even if they're not a Driver.
4	The ability to attack from a distance is\nhugely helpful, too. It helps us avoid the\nrisks of getting too close to monsters.
tlk4532015905_ms.json
1	As far as our Imperial Army duties\nhere go, there's been nothing out\nof the ordinary.
2	I hear things have been pretty hectic\ndown at Port Anangham, though.
3	Only things trying to get into the\ncapital from this side have been\nthe usual monsters.
4	Funny how violent monsters that can't\nbe reasoned with are actually the easier\nthreat to be facing nowadays.
tlk4532017102_ms.json
1	We'll stay here and guard the Titan\nship. You head for the top of the cliff.
2	And please put a stop to our army's\nTitan weapon!
tlk4532019301_ms.json
1	This was the main battlefield of\nthe great war 500 years ago.
2	The scars of the conflict back then\nare still plain to see in the terrain.
3	I got shivers down my spine when I saw\na crater they call the Aegishammer.\nThe power of the Aegis is a scary thing.
tlk4532019302_ms.json
1	This was the main battlefield of\nthe great war 500 years ago.
2	The scars of the conflict back then\nare still plain to see in the terrain.
3	The place names are often related\nto events back then as well, but nobody\nknows the full stories behind them.
4	If somebody were to excavate the ruins\nof the Lost Capital Judicium, maybe\nwe could learn more.
tlk4532029201_ms.json
1	You don't want to go carelessly\ntouching Titan weapons.
2	We still don't fully understand\neverything about how they function.
3	That's why we had an explosive\nincident three months ago.
4	I hope we can finish up here soon\nso I can get back to Mor Ardain...
tlk4532029202_ms.json
1	I thought I wanted to get out of\nhere and back to Mor Ardain as\nsoon as possible...
2	But right now, with everywhere in the\nmiddle of conflict, it might actually\nbe safer to stay here.
3	I just hope my mum back home's\nall right. D'you think she followed\nmy advice and fled to Gormott...?

tlk4532039101_ms.json
1	His Majesty gave the order to halt\nall Titan weapon excavation, but\nSenator Roderich went ahead anyway.
2	Since it's all unofficial, we never got\nsent any powerful Driver soldiers\nto back us up or anything.
3	So of course we were never going to be\nable to face up to the likes of Torna!
4	He just doesn't know how to\nmanage a crisis at all.\nDon't tell anyone I said that, mind.
tlk4532039102_ms.json
1	We received word that Mor Ardain\nhas initiated open conflict.
2	I'd like to send this Titan weapon to\nback them up, but with so few people\nassigned, we've barely made progress.

1	Three months ago, there was an\nexplosive accident caused by the\nTitan weapon.
2	According to the testimony of the\nsurviving workers, the cause was\nhuman error.
3	Some fool tried to operate the system\nwithout following the procedures, and\nhandled the Titan fluid incorrectly.
4	Moral is, even when we think we have\nthis great weapon under control,\nwe don't really understand it.
5	Whoever built this thing is probably\nlaughing at us from beyond the grave.
tlk4532039202_ms.json
1	Much as I'd like to set up this\nTitan weapon up for use in combat\nas soon as possible...
2	As you can see, we're critically\nshort on manpower, and this thing\nis extremely difficult to handle.

1	I'm from the Operations Testing\nDepartment.
2	Our main job is to test new equipment\ndeveloped by Central R&D.
3	Things like guns and armor for\nthe regular infantry.
4	The Imperial Army doesn't have\nall that many Drivers.
5	So developing powerful weapons\nthat anyone can use is an important\ninvestment of resources.
6	...I guess that doesn't have much\nto do with you though, huh?
7	All you need to be able to dominate\nin combat is your Blades and maybe\na few Core Chips. It's not fair, really.
tlk4532065102_ms.json
1	I'd heard rumors about artificial Blades,\nbut I never thought someone had made\nthem a reality already...
2	Our R&D team must be lagging behind.\nWhoever developed that thing is\nrunning rings around them.
3	I guess there's something to be said for\nNopon innovation. Do you think any of\nthem would be willing to give a lecture?
tlk4532065103_ms.json
1	I heard a rumor that the inventor of\nartificial Blades lived in Torigoth,\nso I went to pay him a visit.
2	Unfortunately, I couldn't get him\nto tell me any juicy secrets about\nartificial Blades.
3	I did get to see a bunch of the materials\nused to make them, though.
4	Tetra-Circle!
5	Snake Joint!
6	Black Ash!
7	Delta Vessel!
8	Rabbit Diode!
9	Morph Orb!
10	Photonic Coil!
11	Fairy-Tale Belt Pulley!
12	Arc Indicator!
13	...That was as much as I got to see,\nbut I suspect the list goes on for\nat least ten times that length.
14	At any rate, I intend to visit Professor\nTatazo again in the near future. I'll get\nthose juicy secrets out of him yet!
tlk4532065104_ms.json
1	I went to Torigoth to visit\nProfessor Tatazo again.
2	It was a more fruitful trip than\nlast time, that's for sure!
3	I actually managed to score\n9,840 points in Tiger! Tiger!
4	Smashed my old high score,\ndon't you know!
5	Though I still didn't manage to\nbeat Professor Tatazo himself...
6	I think I'm going to have a word\nwith Central R&D.
7	Tell them to stop working on artificial\nBlades for now, and try to make a real\nmasterpiece like Tiger! Tiger!
tlk4532065110_ms.json
1	Hmmmmm... This job really doesn't\nseem suited to my skills...
2	Apparently, it's become necessary to\ndramatically increase the pace of our\nmineralogy and forestry studies.
3	What that means right now is, we need\nto collect the latest data from our field\nresearchers with the utmost urgency.
4	The problem is, I'm an Operations\nTesting worker, not a communications\nspecialist or messenger boy.
5	It seems quite illogical that I should be\nassigned to a task of this nature...
6	Oh, would you? That would be most\nhelpful. I'm sure it was just a clerical\nerror that I was assigned to this, really.
7	But with you on the case, I feel safe\nin the knowledge that the task will be\nhandled efficiently. Good luck!

2	It is the finest Titan ship in all of the\nArgentum Trade Guild, after all.

1	'Fraid you can't board the Maelstrom\nright now. Sorry.
2	Once we're done with the expedition\nhere, we need to be ready for the\njourney back to Goldmouth, right?
3	So we're taking care of the necessary\nmaintenance right now.
4	Now if you're done hanging around\nhere, I'd suggest you hurry up and go\nfind your objective!
5	I don't want to stay in this creepy\nplace any longer than I have to...
tlk4534011205_ms.json
1	I tell you, that's the last time I take on\na salvaging job in an uncharted region.
2	I think I'm going to stick to boring old\nmaintenance work for the time being.

1	We're keeping her well-maintained,\nbut there are no plans for the\nMaelstrom to set sail any time soon.

3	Here's hoping when her next mission\ndoes come along, it goes a darn sight\nmore smoothly than her last one!

4	My job is to organize those requests\nfor easy reference.
5	The only jobs I can ask you to help\nus with right now are...
6	Well, guarding our leader Vandham,\nI suppose.
7	Not that there's any reward\non offer for that one.
8	Ah, there you are, Vandham.\nCausing extra trouble for everyone\nas usual, are we?
9	I know you have a habit of picking up\nall sorts of folk on your travels.\nThat's how I came to Garfont myself.
10	But the Aegis and her Driver, of all\npeople? That really is a new one.
11	*sigh* I can't wait to see what kind of\ntrouble THIS is going to cause.
12	We'll have to be very careful to ensure\nword of all this doesn't get out.

1	I believe Yew and Zuo are wanting\nto speak with you.
2	Of course, I already know\nwhat it's about.

5	I have something prepared\nespecially for you.
tlk4535014103_ms.json
1	Well, well. If it isn't our new leader.
2	Even with Vandham gone, the job\nrequests just keep coming in.

4	You can count on me to fill you in\non the jobs we currently have going.
tlk4535014104_ms.json
1	Ah, it's you.
2	It seems the Garfont Mercenaries\nhave grown under your leadership!

4	Now, would you care to take a\nlook at the new jobs available?
tlk4535014105_ms.json
1	Ah, it's you.
2	Apparently the Garfont Mercenaries\nhave grown in scale again.
3	Perhaps we are starting to properly,\nhow to say, get into our groove?
4	Still plenty of menial work to be done,\nthough. Take a look at the new jobs\nif you don't believe me.
tlk4535014106_ms.json
1	Ah, it's you.
2	It would appear the growth of the\nGarfont Mercenaries knows no bounds\nunder your leadership.
3	We're doing better at this point than\nwe were when Vandham was still\naround, if you can believe that.
4	Yes, we're making quite a name for\nourselves throughout Uraya, it would\nseem. Which means...new jobs for you.
tlk4535014107_ms.json
1	Ah, it's you.
2	You've built up the Garfont Mercenaries\nso much at this point, I can scarcely\nbelieve it myself.
3	If Vandham were here to see it,\nI daresay even he might shed a\ntear or two.
4	And of course, there are new jobs\navailable. Feel free to peruse them.

tlk4535014109_ms.json

2	Apparently Senator Roderich was\nresearching them without permission.
3	I wish he'd asked me to help...
4	Judicium may have fallen long ago,\nbut their technological prowess was\ngreater than Mor Ardain's today!
5	There are so many things we could\nlearn from their work.
tlk4535015303_ms.json

2	Someone remotely controlled\nthe Ardainian Titan itself!
3	I've never seen any technology like it!
4	How in the world do you think\nthey did it?
5	I wish I had even a fraction of that\ntechnology. It would make controlling\nTitan weapons so much easier!
6	It's too late for it now, but perhaps\nwe should have tried storming into\nIndol with Cetus!
tlk4535016201_ms.json
1	Ah, just who I was hoping to see!\nI've been meaning to thank you.
2	You set up that direct trade route from\nYsheva Harbor to Argentum, right?
3	I'm really grateful for your efforts!\nThanks to you, it's so much easier to\nget Argentum goods around here.
4	We can even enjoy the taste of\nCinnopon Rolls now! They spoil so\nfast, we couldn't get them in before.

1	I've finished selling all the goods\nI brought from Mor Ardain, so I'm off\nto the Sanctum for a spot of prayer.
2	No, I'm not particularly religious or\nanything. I just want to get a glimpse of\nLady Fan, Goddess of the Praetorium!
3	There are Urayans in this city too,\nbut when I gaze at Lady Fan, all that\npolitical unrest seems so insignificant.
4	
tlk4535017102_ms.json
1	This world is a cruel, empty place.\nThere is no joy. Only despair.
2	Lady Fan has passed away...\nGazing upon her was all that kept\nmy soul at ease...
3	I hear my homeland of Mor Ardain is\nforming a peace treaty with Uraya.
4	No doubt the result of some higher-up\nseeing Lady Fan's smile and realizing\nthe futility of conflict. Oh, Lady Fan...
tlk4535017103_ms.json
1	There's no point staying here in Indol.\nNot now that Lady Fan is gone.
2	I'm going to leave my work here\nto a colleague and head on back\nhome to Mor Ardain.
3	Oh, Lady Fan... Why do I still visit\nthe Sanctum, knowing I will never\nsee you there again?

1	In Mor Ardain, research on Titans and\nweaponry is a common pursuit even\nat private institutions.
2	It's subsidized by the government,\nyou see.
3	For our current project here, we're\nresearching ways to encourage plant\nlife to grow on the Ardainian Titan.
4	If we could grow our own vegetables,\nwe'd be less dependent on imports,\nand it might help the Titan recover too.
5	That's the dream, anyway. All we can\ndo right now is experiment and hope!
tlk4535025102_ms.json
1	A terrible thing happened recently...\nThe budget for our agricultural\nresearch was reduced!
2	You may already know this, but\nMor Ardain's most valuable business\nby far is the salvaging trade.
3	We use salvaged metals and machinery\nto drive our military, and we refine\nthem for export to other nations.
4	The downside of this is that when\nthe salvaging trade suffers, so does\nour national economy.
5	And I hear pickings were awfully slim\nduring the last fiscal year.
6	Even so...I wish they wouldn't choose\nour budget to slash. This research may\nbe exactly what Mor Ardain needs!
tlk4535025103_ms.json
1	Oh, you won't believe what happened.\nThe budget for our agricultural\nresearch was reduced...again!
2	After the incident in Temperantia,\nit looks like many nations are giving\nmore priority to military development.
3	Uraya is a given, but the surrounding\nnations are following suit as well.
4	And of course, Mor Ardain can't\nafford to fall behind!
5	If we don't redouble our own military\nefforts, the other countries could\nbecome a very real threat.
6	But of course, what that means for us\nis our research funding gets diverted to\nmilitary research instead.
7	I know it's an emergency, but that\ndoesn't make it any less frustrating.
tlk4535025104_ms.json
1	Light rained down from the heavens\nabove, and another Titan sank beneath\nthe clouds...
2	When Mor Ardain moved so close to\nthe World Tree, I expected the worst...
3	But as it turns out, those light attacks\nhaven't actually hit us very hard.
4	Perhaps they're holding back for fear\nof damaging the World Tree itself?
5	The Titans further away from the\nWorld Tree do seem to be suffering\nmuch greater losses...
6	It just makes me feel so powerless.
7	All the research we've conducted\nup until now...what was it all for?
8	In the end, would we have been better\noff just working on stronger weapons?\nWould that have prepared us for this?
9	I don't know what to feel but regret...
tlk4535035101_ms.json
1	There aren't any ships leaving\nfor Indol for a fair while.
2	You'll bore yourselves to death if you\nhang around here, so I'd suggest paying\nthe capital a visit.
3	Just head out of Port Anangham\nand follow the path straight.
tlk4535035102_ms.json
1	You know there's a gate that's always\nshut tight here in Port Anangham?
2	That gate leads to an area called\nChansagh Wastes. We keep it shut\nto ward off the dangerous monsters.
3	You could visit the Wastes yourself\nif you're looking for a challenge. But if\nyou're not up to it, I'd steer well clear.
tlk4535035103_ms.json
1	With Tantal re-entering the global\nmarket, I guess we're going to see\nbig developments in trade.
2	If we take the opportunity to grow our\nown economy, maybe we can work with\nTantal to make some new products.
3	One thing's for sure - things are going\nto get plenty busy around here!
tlk4535035104_ms.json
1	We're accepting refugees from Indol.
2	Not just a few of them, either.\nWe're even having to use the Titan\nships' cabins as temporary lodgings.
3	Only thing is... Even with all these\nrefugees, it's still just a fraction of the\npeople who lived in Indol, right?
4	These are the lucky ones who escaped.\nThere must be many more who didn't\nmake it out in time...
5	I hope they're still alive somewhere,\nsomehow. Even if it's in Morytha or\nsomething crazy like that.
tlk4537012201_ms.json
1	As time goes on, many soldiers have\nbegun to harbor all kinds of doubts\nthat distract from their duties.
2	But Newt's passion for her duty\nwas unwavering. She reminded me\nof the Ardainian army's golden days.
3	Newt was a valuable asset\nto Mor Ardain.
4	Once her time with you is done and she\nreturns to her Core Crystal, I hope you\nwill return her to the Ardainian army.
tlk4537015101_ms.json
1	Despite his young age, Emperor Niall\nis a most wise and gracious ruler.
2	It is only thanks to his efforts that we\nhave been able to avoid open hostilities\nwith Uraya for so long.
3	Thanks to His Majesty, we have\nkept the bloody business of war\nto a minimum.
4	As long as Emperor Niall is on the\nthrone, I feel certain the peace of\nMor Ardain will be safe.
tlk4537015103_ms.json
1	That fool Roderich! He just had to act\ncarelessly, and look where it got us!\nTaken advantage of by Torna!
2	If it weren't for Indol's intervention,\nwho knows what might have happened!
3	I suppose we'd better be thankful\nfor that.
4	I expect the pro-war faction of the\nSenate will be forced to lie low for a\nwhile after this, too.
5	Roderich's actions were reckless and\nterrible, but in the end, they may have\nworked to our advantage.
6	I'm sure Roderich himself will not\nescape a harsh sentence, of course...
tlk4537015104_ms.json
1	We may have avoided war with Uraya,\nbut the underlying issues have not\nbeen solved.
2	The fact remains that our relationship\nwith Uraya is more strained than ever\nafter the Temperantia incident.
3	At this rate, when the life of the\nMor Ardain Titan reaches its inevitable\nend, Gormott will be our only refuge...
4	I would like to avoid resorting to war\nas much as anyone, but I am failing to\nenvision a peaceful solution...
tlk4537015105_ms.json
1	Please leave the Emperor to us.
2	I and the Royal Guard are\nprepared to face the worst.
3	Even if we are beset by the Titans\nthemselves, we will protect\nHis Majesty at any cost.
4	In return, I can only ask that you do\neverything in your power to overcome\nthe trials that face you.
5	For everyone's sake.
tlk4537015201_ms.json
1	With the tensions with Uraya riding\nhigh for so long, our military expenses\njust keep going up.
2	Sooner or later, the funds we earn from\nGormott and the surrounding minor\nnations won't be enough to cover them.
3	If we don't do something about all this\nsoon, our national coffers will be wrung\ndry and our people will starve!
4	As a member of the Imperial Senate,\nit is my duty to do something about the\nsituation. But what should I propose...?
tlk4537015202_ms.json
1	What do you want?
2	I told you before, it isn't wise\nfor us to be seen together...
3	Brionac may be ruined, but you never\nknow who might be watching...

1	It's clear that the ancient Nopon\npossessed a high level of knowledge.
2	But looking at the Nopon of the modern\nday, it is difficult to imagine them\nleaving behind artifacts of this nature.
3	What could have happened\nto change the Nopon race so\nin the intervening years...?
tlk4537015302_ms.json
1	I've just about exhausted the work I\ncan do on studying the ruins here now.
2	I tried to explain their historical value\nto the mercenaries, but they don't\nseem to take much of an interest.
3	What to do, what to do...\nI can't really just return to Mor Ardain\nat this point...
tlk4537015303_ms.json
1	...So as you can see, by learning of\npast events we can come to understand\nwhat brings success and what failure.
2	This is why it is paramount that we\nretain records of our history, for the\nsake of the future.
3	Please don't interrupt me in the\nmiddle of a lesson.
tlk4537015304_ms.json
1	The mayor told me all about\nthe Village Guardian.
2	I'd like to investigate this Spirit Crucible\nElpys place as well, but I can't afford\nto put myself in danger right now.
3	A teacher being reckless would set\na terrible example for the children.\nI'll hold off until they're all grown up.
tlk4537015305_ms.json
1	Something lovely happened recently.
2	I was approached by a number of\nNopon who are interested in learning\nmore about ancient Nopon history.
3	This is all thanks to the work of\nRododo in Argentum, spreading the\nword of Captain Nopopon's deeds!
tlk4537015401_ms.json
1	Mor Ardain is a military nation.\nAs such, all of the people organizing\nnational affairs are military officers.
2	The Departments of Finance,\nMeteorology, Justice, Security...\nall are run as military branches.
3	To avoid power being monopolized\nby a select few, nobody is stationed\nin the same place for too long.
4	Dughall was over the moon when\nhe was assigned to administrate the\nlargely peaceful territory of Gormott...
5	But in the end, he failed to even\nserve his full term in office.
tlk4537015402_ms.json
1	The Ardainian Army has a policy of\nactively scouting new Drivers to recruit.
2	The main goal, of course, is to bolster\nour own forces, but it also helps avoid\nDrivers being recruited by rival nations.
3	This is why we carry out scouting\nactivities in as many territories as\nwe can manage.
4	Gormott is a particular focus, because\nmany Gormotti still harbor ill feeling\ntowards the Empire.
5	It would be quite troublesome if they\nwere to throw their lot in with Uraya.
6	So we encourage them to join our\nmilitary before that happens.
tlk4537015403_ms.json
1	One industry which Mor Ardain\nsupports heavily is the salvaging trade.
2	This is because salvaged materials\nare invaluable both for military use\nand as a profitable export.
3	However, the nation's salvaging\nactivities are not centered here in\nthe capital.
4	There's a port town called Chilsain on\nthe Titan's right shoulder where most\nof the salvaging used to take place.
5	I say "used to" because we've received\nword that Chilsain was razed beyond\nrecovery by those attacks from the sky.
6	There was a large fortress there, and a\nmajor military port... I fear many proud\nArdainian lives must have been lost.

1	Just when I was enjoying a nice drink\nof Odifa from Cafe Lutino, they had to\ncome along and spoil the mood.
2	You saw them too, right?\nAll those anti-Blade protesters!
3	I mean, sure, Blades are used for war.\nBut it's not like they're the ones\ncausing the conflict, are they?
4	It's the Urayan government they should\nbe protesting to. If they surrender,\nthat'd soon stop the fighting.
tlk4540007102_ms.json
1	So I hear Mor Ardain and Uraya are\nfinally making peace.
2	No more war is a good thing, but\nI don't know what Mor Ardain is\ngoing to do from here on out.
3	Everyone knows the homeland isn't\ngoing to last much longer. Is Mor Ardain\njust going to perish with its Titan?
4	Oh, it's no good, I'm just depressing\nmyself thinking about it. I'll go grab a\npick-me-up Odifa at Cafe Lutino.
tlk4540007103_ms.json

1	That's an adorable Blade you're\ntraveling with, my dear!
2	Though knowing Drivers and Blades,\nI suppose even the cutest of you still\nget up to some pretty barbaric stuff.
3	Like knocking enemies to the ground\nand then launching them into the air...
4	Or even smashing them back down\ninto the ground for massive damage!\nI've heard those Urayan brutes do that.
5	I can't stand that kind of thing. Battle\nshould be handled with precision and\ngrace. Like Special Inquisitor Mòrag!
6	Oh, what I wouldn't give to be able\nto have tea with her sometime...
tlk4540025102_ms.json
1	I actually caught a glimpse of\nSpecial Inquisitor Mòrag recently!\nIn the flesh!
2	Ohhh, she was so dashing...
3	She effortlessly toppled that villainous\nboy to the ground and then launched\nhim high into the air!
4	Then she rained attacks on him\nwhile he was helpless to resist!
5	So elegant... So refined...\nIt was like watching a master at work!
6	Huh? That's not how you remember it?
7	Don't taint my memories... That's how\nit looked to me from a distance!
8	Ah... Ahhhhh...
9	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Wh-what should I say?! I can't breathe!\nAm I dreaming? Is Lady Mòrag really\nstanding right in front of me?!
tlk4540025103_ms.json
1	I want to send Scenna to visit\nGormott someday so she can try\nthe confections there.
2	Apparently Ardainian cuisine is not very\nwell-regarded by the global community.
3	So I want to give Scenna the\nopportunity to try Gormotti cuisine,\nwhich is supposed to be quite delicious.
4	I'm sure it would help her to improve\nher own recipes.
tlk4540025104_ms.json
1	Mor Ardain has been trading with Uraya\nmore often lately. Something to do with\nthe economy booming, I suppose?
2	So I came up with the idea for a new\nbread confection using an Urayan fruit\ncalled Ruby Mangosteen.
3	A fruity bun that's warm on the outside,\nbut cool and sweet on the inside!
4	It's called the Hot Ruby Steamed Bun!\nYou might have heard of it already.\nBet you didn't know I invented it!
5	Scenna's selling them at her store\nright now, so you should definitely\ntry some if you haven't.
6	It's funny, though. A little while back,\nI would never have dreamed we'd be\nable to use ingredients from Uraya.
7	I guess we should be thankful\nto a certain someone for that.

1	I'm a wanderer, traveling Alrest\nas the wind takes me.
2	The people of Garfont were kind\nenough to let me stay awhile.
3	Don't you think the markings on\nGarfont's cave walls are fascinating?
4	I can't read them myself, but I think\nthey're some kind of inscriptions\nfrom long ago.
5	I've traveled all over, and I can tell\nyou they're a pretty unusual sight.
6	There's a friend of mine in the\nArdainian capital, name of Alisdeigh,\nwho might be able to figure them out.
tlk4542014102_ms.json
1	To think the inscriptions here\nturned out to be the work of the\nancient Nopon.
2	I was talking with Alisdeigh, and he\nexplained that long ago, those murals\nused to be just above water level.
3	Over the years, the place drained out,\nand now at the bottom of what used\nto be a lake...
4	We have the whole mercenary village\nof Garfont!
5	The history of Alrest holds so many\nmysteries to unravel. It's fascinating!
6	I think I'm going to set out wandering\nagain soon. I want to find more places\nlike this one, brimming with mystery!

1	Vandham would have told Nicc\nto stay too. I'm sure of it.\nYou made the right choice.
2	I'm sure Jelved will be able to\nunderstand too, someday.
3	He just needs to do a bit more\ngrowing up. Nobody can live a perfect\nlife, unless they're some kind of god.
tlk4542014202_ms.json
1	You were just trying to respect Nicc\nand Jelved's feelings, weren't you?\nI can understand your decision.
2	Nicc is a strong man. I'm sure he'll\nbe able to do all right for himself in\nsome other mercenary band.
3	As for Jelved... We'll just have to work\ntogether as a village to help him forget\nhis thirst for revenge, little by little.
tlk4542014401_ms.json
1	Vandham always manages to find the\nmost interesting individuals to bring\nback here, doesn't he?
2	I never thought the legendary Aegis\nwould be such a cute girl! I mean, not\nthat that's a bad thing or anything.
3	But yeah, we take all sorts here.\nWhen you've seen as many crazy folk\nas we have, an Aegis is no biggie.
tlk4542014402_ms.json
1	Even without Vandham, the Garfont\nMercenaries aren't going anywhere.
2	We have to carry on what he started.\nI think we all feel that way.
3	Did you talk to Yew and Zuo yet?
4	There's a lot riding on your\nshoulders too. So good luck!
tlk4542014403_ms.json
1	It feels like the life has really returned\nto Garfont thanks to all of you.
2	I'm sure more jobs will come in as the\nband grows, but if those aren't enough,\nyou'd better find some for yourself.
3	Best way is to keep your eyes out for\npeople who look like they need help,\nand talking to 'em directly!
4	You might want to try heading back\nto towns you've already visited, even.
tlk4542014404_ms.json
1	The Garfont Mercenaries seem to be\ngrowing at a steady rate.
2	Do you think we might actually\nend up bigger than we were when\nVandham was around?
3	The guy had a big heart and an even\nbigger body, but he wasn't exactly big\non sweating the small stuff.
4	To make the band any bigger than\nit is now will take someone with an\neye for details and efficiency.
5	The main thing is to look at the skills\nrequired for each mission and choose\nappropriate Blades for the job.
6	Do that, and you can clear up missions\nthat would usually take a whole day\nin the space of a single morning!
tlk4542014405_ms.json
1	Alrest is in a real state right now, huh.
2	But even in times like this, I feel like\nthe Garfont Mercenaries are doing\nsome pretty great work.
3	We're helping out the people who\nneed it, just like we always do.\nSome people even see us as saviors.
4	I think that's mostly down to you.\nSo thanks for all your hard work.
5	This band might have grown as big as\nit's ever going to get, but I hope you'll\nkeep up the good work all the same.

1	Alba Cavanich is pretty prosperous\nright now, you know?
2	Anything you need, chances are\ngood you can buy it right here in\nAyvill Shopping District.
3	But cross Midorl Bridge and head out\nof the capital, and it's a different story.\nIt's a barren wasteland out there.
4	You'll want to be careful if you're\nventuring out of the city. The area\nisn't exactly hospitable.
5	Also, I'd recommend you don't head\nright after crossing the bridge.\nYou might run into a dangerous lot.
tlk4542015102_ms.json
1	The other night, after I'd been drinking,\nI got questioned by these military types.
2	They were asking if I had anything\nto do with that mechanical girl.
3	I mean, what kind of an idiot do they\ntake me for? I wouldn't cause a fuss\nin the middle of the imperial capital!
4	I think the army are just grasping at\nstraws at this point. Getting desperate\nafter that girl gave them a beating.
5	If I were you, I'd be careful not to\narouse any suspicion. They'll latch\non to most anything lately.
tlk4542015103_ms.json
1	When a Blade is awakened from a\nCore Crystal, the form they take is\ninfluenced by the Driver's heart.
2	So the classic strategy is to use a\nbooster to enhance whichever aspect\nyou're already strongest in.
3	But if you're looking to awaken a\ndifferent kind of Blade from usual,\nit's worth boosting a different aspect.
4	Of course, none of this makes it a\nsure thing. At the end of the day,\nthe Blade you get is down to luck.
tlk4542015104_ms.json
1	I just remembered an old story\nmy grandma told me once.
2	It was about a man called Ephem,\nknown as the First Emperor.
3	Ephem journeyed across the lands\nto build up his own legacy, and on his\nway, he met someone named Carraig.
4	The stories aren't clear on who Carraig\nactually was - male or female, a Titan\nor a scientist, a Blade or a Driver...
5	But at any rate, Ephem journeyed with\nCarraig until they reached this Titan,\nwhere they founded Mor Ardain.
6	Ephem's son followed in his father's\nfootsteps, uniting the nearby nations\nand turning Mor Ardain into an Empire.
7	...Mor Ardain has the longest history\nof any nation in this area.
8	So I suppose it's only natural that our\nTitan's life will end sooner or later.
9	Even so, I worry that we're placing too\nmuch strain on our Titan right now...\nThat can't be good for anyone.

1	Chairman Bana told you where to go,\ndidn't he? Down to the Exit Dock,\non the starboard side of Goldmouth.

1	Me and Harghal, we both have\na flair for dancing.
2	That's why Bana took such a shine\nto us, and now we're his personal\ndancing girls and secretaries.
3	Though if I'm honest, I think he likes\nHarghal more than he likes me.
4	At any rate, I'm grateful for how well\nhe treats us, and I enjoy the work.

tlk4545011104_ms.json
1	I'm always trying to find time to\npractice my dancing with Harghal.
2	She's really good, you know.
3	I try to work hard to keep up with her,\nbut I don't feel like I'll ever be as good.
4	It's like a dream to be able to do\nwhat I love for a living, so I have to\nmake sure my skills are up to scratch!
tlk4545011105_ms.json
1	So it turns out Chairman Bana was\na real villain all along, huh?
2	I can't believe this is happening...
3	To add insult to injury, I managed\nto hurt my leg pretty bad.
4	It really feels like the happy times\nare just a distant memory already.
5	Ugh... This is all Harghal's fault,\nI know it is. That dirty traitor!
tlk4545011106_ms.json
1	I started up my dancing again.\nNot full time or anything, but in\nbetween my other work.
2	What I really want is to become\nbetter than Harghal.
3	I want to be able to impress her\nwhen we meet again someday!
4	It feels like I'm really starting to\nget my life back into gear again\nthanks to you guys.
5	So...thank you.
tlk4545011201_ms.json
1	A hundred grand...that's quite\nthe pretty little sum.
2	Yeah, I've never been paid anything\nlike this much before.
3	And you get another hundred grand\nwhen you get back? Lucky you. What\nI wouldn't give for that kind of money...
4	Well, um...
5	Haha, I'm not trying to guilt you\nor anything. You just do your best\nout there, all right?

1	When we don't have work to do for\nBana, Krujah and I talk about dancing.
2	We could never have made a living\nas dancers back in our hometowns, so\nwe made the right choice coming here!
3	It's lovely to be able to work together\nwith someone who shares my passion\nfor dancing. And the pay's great too!
tlk4545011204_ms.json
1	Chairman Bana has been too busy\nlately to give us much work to do,\nclerical or dancing.
2	Since our pay is commission-based,\nthat's not great for our bottom line.
3	It's a real problem...\nI'm not sure what I ought to do.

1	はっはっはぁ！　ここに来たという事は\n宿を利用したいという事なのだな？
2	いいぞいいぞぉ！　どんどん使え！\nどんな用途に使おうと俺は許すぞ！
3	はっはっはぁ！　心地の良い目覚めだろう！\nウチの宿は気持ちよさが違うからな！
4	泊まっていかなくていいのか？\n溜まっているんだろう？　疲れが
tlk4545016101_ms.json
1	Whew, that was a proper struggle.\nI should never have taken that\nright-hand route.
2	Oh, if you leave this port and head to\nBaldotas Isle, the path splits in two.
3	The path on the right is just teeming\nwith scary monsters! I'd stick to the\nleft path if I were you.

tlk4545016102_ms.json
1	I've seen you in Rigitte Harbor before,\nhaven't I? You seem stronger than you\nwere before, though.
2	When you leave this port and head for\nBaldotas Isle, the path splits in two.
3	The left-hand path is the safest route\nto Fonsett Village...
4	But if you want to really test your skills,\nyou could try heading right instead!\nJust...don't blame me if you regret it.

1	Welcoooooome to Adelno Musiiiic! ♪\nAll the beeeeeest in Ardaaaainian\niiiiinstruments! ♪
2	Owneeeeeer! ♪\nSuch a pleasure to seeeeeee you! ♪\nEnjoy your visit to Adelno Musiiiiic! ♪
tlk4550015201_ms.json
1	You there - you look like you have\nsome skills! Care to try your hand\nworking here?
2	I see...that's a shame. I'm sure you\nwould've done a great job.
3	Skill is all that matters here -\nwe'll employ anyone as long as\nthey've got what it takes.
4	I just wish Isset would give up on\nthat barely profitable junk shop of\nhis and work here instead...
tlk4550015202_ms.json
1	OK, who's been messing around with\nmy stuff while I was asleep?!
2	The boxes I stacked up for maximum\nefficiency are a whole ped out of line!
3	The imperial soldiers were causing a\nruckus during the night, weren't they?
4	Defending the peace of the capital is\nall very well, but I wish they'd consider\nour livelihoods as well!
5	We don't pay all that tax for\nnothing, you know!
tlk4550015203_ms.json
1	Let me tell you about my dream.
2	I love board games like nothing else.\nPlay them with the kids every night.
3	So one day, I'd like to buy all the\nproducts in Elgeschel Hobby Store\nand become the store's owner myself!
4	Course, even as the owner you don't\nget to buy their stuff for free. But it'd\nbe something to boast about, right?!
tlk4550015204_ms.json
1	Now who's gone and become the\nowner of Elgeschel Hobby Store, eh?
2	I was saving up money to buy that\nplace myself, you know!
3	Though I have to admit, this game\nDealing Kingdoms is an absolute blast.
4	It's based on Duelling Kingdoms, but\nthe added Nopon Trade Guild elements\ngive it so much more depth!
5	And this Plumber Escape Game is\nfantastic too! Me and the kids play\nit together most every day.
6	I guess it's thanks to the new owner\nthat we've got all these great new\ngames in the lineup now.
7	So while it kills me to admit it,\nmaybe I should be thanking them.\nWhoever they are.
tlk4550015210_ms.json
1	Oh dear, oh dear... This is a fine\npickle I've managed to wind up in.
2	There was a bit of a mix-up while\nI was moving some goods.
3	The real precious antiques got all in a\njumble with a bunch of counterfeits!
4	Yeah, these are some really valuable\nitems. We're talking around a million G.
5	If I wind up giving the client a\ncounterfeit in place of the real thing...\nLet's just say it'll be curtains for me.
6	I'm clutching at straws here...\nDo you know of any way to sort out\nthe real deal from the fakes?
7	Wh-what?! Really?!
8	I can trust you guys with this, right?\nYou won't mess up, right?!
tlk4550015301_ms.json
1	If you're visiting Alba Cavanich,\nyou shouldn't miss out on our\nfamous hot springs.
2	I'm sure you must have noticed that\nthere's natural steam rising from the\nground all over these parts.
3	Some of it gets used for energy in\npower plants, but other places use\nit to heat luxurious public baths.
4	Alba Cavanich is an uptight sort of\nplace to live in, so the baths are one of\nthe few opportunities we get to unwind.
5	I make sure to visit every day, myself.\nHahaha!
tlk4550015302_ms.json
1	Here's a bit of gossip I heard\nat the baths.
2	You know that ruckus that went down\nin Alba Cavanich at night? Apparently\nan artificial Blade was behind it.
3	Creating Blades from machinery, can\nyou believe it? The things technology\ncan do these days!
4	Actually, something just occurred\nto me.
5	Since we have more Core Crystals than\ncompatible users, wouldn't it be more\nefficient to make artificial Drivers?
tlk4550015303_ms.json
1	Here's a bit of gossip I heard\nat the baths.
2	You know there's an old factory\naround the Mor Ardain Titan's chest?
3	Apparently someone was secretly\nusing that place to manufacture\na ton of artificial Blades!
4	My old man reckoned some group\ncalled Lindwurm had bought up a\nbunch of them.
5	But nobody seems to know where\nthey've got to now.
tlk4550015304_ms.json
1	Here's a bit of gossip I heard\nat the baths.
2	Apparently Senator Roderich\nwas excavating some terrible\nthing in Temperantia!
3	I swear, those war hawks in the Senate\nare always up to no good...
4	But what I'd like to know is - who\nactually benefited the most from\nthis whole debacle?
tlk4550015305_ms.json
1	Here's a bit of gossip I heard\nat the baths.
2	Apparently nobody's seen hide\nnor hair of the Emperor's personal\nBlade around here lately.
3	There are all sorts of wild rumors\nabout where he could have gone.
4	Saying he's been sent to assassinate\nthe Queen of Uraya, or that he was sent\nto marry her as a sign of goodwill!
tlk4550015306_ms.json
1	Here's a bit of gossip I heard\nat the baths.
2	Apparently the Tantalese Titan has\nshown its face in the Cloud Sea for the\nfirst time in forever!
3	Nobody had a clue where it was lurking\nfor years and years... I wonder what\nprompted this sudden development.
4	Rumor has it that something very\nsinister might be afoot.
5	Though we seem to have a decent\nrelationship with them, so I suppose\nit could be a good thing for trade!
tlk4550015307_ms.json
1	Let me tell you about something that\nhappened while I was at the baths.
2	I was just getting ready for a nice soak,\nchatting about the latest gossip, when\nan earthquake shook the whole place!
3	Ran out onto the roof stark naked I did,\nand what do you think I saw? Only the\nWorld Tree drawing closer and closer!
4	And that wasn't the end of it, either!\nSuddenly the Titan itself unleashed\na mighty attack!
5	It blew up such a powerful wind,\nmy towel was swept clean away!
6	Everyone scrambled back down\ninto the baths as fast as our\nlegs could carry us!
tlk4550015308_ms.json
1	Here's a bit of gossip I heard\nat the baths.
2	Apparently we ought to all be leaving\nMor Ardain as soon as we can manage.
3	The Titan won't last much longer,\nthat's what they're saying.
4	...I guess that's not the kind of topic\nwe should really be discussing all\ncasual-like while having a soak.
5	But you know what? I think I can\naccept it. This is my home, and if it's\ngoing down, I'll go down with it.
6	If I can spend my last moments in a\nnice hot bath, what more can I ask for?
7	...Though lately, I feel like the baths\nhave been getting a tad TOO hot.\nWouldn't hurt to turn it down a little.
tlk4550019101_ms.json
1	How's the patient?
2	Thanks for the info.\nSo my medicine works on Flesh Eaters.\nGood to know.
tlk4550019102_ms.json
1	Listen here!\nCuriosity's the key to science.
2	For a start, you can show a bit of\ncuriosity towards the ordinary things\naround you.
3	What's a chair made from?\nHow do trees grow?\nWhat do they need to thrive?
4	Kids absorb these things quickly.\nWish my old assistant had been\nsuch a quick learner.
tlk4550019103_ms.json
1	All I used to think about was\ncuring patients.
2	Now I have other priorities.\nPassing on my knowledge to kids.\nIt's not bad, actually.
3	I'll make the school here in Fonsett\na fine one. Better than any stuffy old\nacademy in Indol.
tlk4550019104_ms.json
1	Mor Ardain's getting emptier.\nPeople leaving every day.
2	They're all scared. Crops aren't\ngrowing, animals getting sickly.
3	Me, I just run my clinic.\nSame as always.
tlk4550042101_ms.json
1	And who might you be, hmm?
2	From the looks of you... You must be\nhere to ask my advice, I suppose?
3	I see, I see... Must've gotten\nthe wrong end of the stick.
4	Drivers often come to me asking\nfor advice on their work, you know.
5	I'm retired now - age does take its\ntoll - but I had quite the career as\na Driver myself, you see.
6	Though at this point, I'm no different\nfrom any other old man living out my\nremaining days in peace.
tlk4550042102_ms.json
1	Hohohoh...\nJust a few bites of choclit,\nbefore she comes back...
2	Wha-?! Who's there?! Don't talk to\nme out of the blue like that!
3	You gave me such a fright, I thought\nmy heart might stop then and there!
4	I'm just glad it was you and not her...\nShe'd kill me if she saw me gorging\non this stuff.
tlk4550042103_ms.json
1	I wonder what'll be for dinner tonight...\nHohoh. As if I don't know the answer.
2	Doubt
3	I live together with my Blade partner,\nyou see, and she always serves up the\nsame thing every night.
4	I can't complain, though. Decades I've\nbeen eating them, and I still haven't\ngot sick of them! They're that good!
tlk4560014101_ms.json
1	Hey there. If you have good Blades,\nit's only right to give them good\nAux Cores, don't you think?
tlk4560015101_ms.json
1	Hey there. Might I recommend\nour Dolphin Carrot Sliders?\nThey're delicious!
2	And what can I get for our dear owner\ntoday? A Crispy Vegetable Salad\nperhaps? Or a Steamflake Tabbouleh?
tlk4560015201_ms.json
1	Welcome to Jakolo's.\nHow would you like to relax and\nunwind in our famous outdoor baths?
tlk4560015501_ms.json
1	I received a letter from Harghal,\nwith some money attached.
2	The letter wasn't long - she just asked\nme not to worry about her, because\nshe's doing fine.
3	I have no idea where she might be, but\nif she's happy, that's enough for me.
tlk4560017101_ms.json
1	Ahahahaha... Finally I am here!\nThe Indoline Sanctum...it's everything\nI imagined! One gigantic work of art!
2	I told my husband in Argentum I had\nan "important trade deal" to negotiate.\nHe'd never have let me visit otherwise!
3	Ahh, I wonder how much the carvings\non a single pillar here are worth?
4	Oh, but that's the merchant in me\ntalking! Silly me...you can't put a price\non this kind of magnificent artwork!
tlk4560017102_ms.json
1	I needed to catch my breath after\nexperiencing such a historical moment.\nA spot of prayer should do the trick.
2	Really, I suppose I ought to go home\nto Argentum before I get mixed up in\nany of this, but...I think I'll stick around.
3	I only planned to come here on a lazy\ntourist spree, but...my merchant blood\nis telling me I have to see this through!
4	
tlk4560017103_ms.json
1	I wanted to fit in a spot of prayer\nbefore heading home to Argentum,\nbut they wouldn't let me in.
2	The place used to be open to\nanyone, tourists included...\nI wonder what happened.
3	
tlk4560055101_ms.json
1	This is a storage area for goods to be\ntransported into Alba Cavanich.
2	Mor Ardain's main exports are salvaged\nmaterials and manufactured goods.
3	Our food, though, is mostly imported.\nWithout the money our tech brings in,\nwe'd barely be able to feed ourselves.
4	There's always a ton of imported\ngoods sitting around here, ready\nto be carried into the city.
5	The freight elevator needs permission\nto use, but the personnel elevator is\nopen to the public.
6	Now, you probably don't want to hang\naround in a dusty old place like this.\nHurry along into the city.
tlk4560055102_ms.json
1	All sorts of different goods pass\nthrough here into the city.
2	The soldiers carry out inspections\noccasionally, but they don't have time\nto check everything.
3	If something dodgy was mixed in\namong the rest, chances are nobody\nwould ever find out.
4	'Course, most of the stuff here comes\nfrom Gormott, so it's totally safe.
tlk4560055103_ms.json
1	The Ardainian economy seems to have\nreally picked up lately.
2	You can get things for cheaper than\nbefore, and new products are starting\nto become available.
3	I guess that's thanks to consumers\nbuying plenty of stuff, and people's\nproblems getting sorted out.
4	When people's lives are happier, they\nspend more freely, which is good for\nkeeping the economy moving.
tlk4560055104_ms.json
1	The Ardainian Titan may not be in\nthe greatest of shape, but at least\nour economy is thriving.
2	Business around here is better than\nI've ever seen it before.
3	Apparently we're collaborating\nwith other nations, even Uraya,\nto make entirely new products.
4	I'd considered the idea of that sort\nof collaboration before, but I never\nthought it would become a reality.
5	Maybe the promise of profits is all it\ntakes for our nations to get along, haha!
tlk4560055110_ms.json
1	Well, they certainly got us good\nthis time...
2	We had a bit of an incident here.\nThe containers were attacked by\nVolff in the middle of the night.
3	They didn't manage to get at the\ncontents, but they ruined the locks on\nsome, and others won't even close now.
4	And we're not talking just a couple,\neither. The number of damaged\ncontainers is in the double digits.
5	If we don't fix them up quickly, it'll\nstart affecting the transport schedules,\nbut with so many containers to repair...
6	All right. I'll let you handle it!\nYou'd better do a good job, though!
tlk4570011101_ms.json
1	Rex, m'boy!
2	This Nopon here's just arrived to do\na bit of sightseeing around Argentum.
3	I keep saying the Central Exchange is\ninside Goldmouth, just after you enter\nthe ship, but he just doesn't get it.
4	And now he wants me to take him up\nto Lemour Inn on the third floor!
5	I'm a salvager, not a tour guide!
tlk4570011102_ms.json
1	I've been in the salvaging business\ntwenty years now. Let me give you\na bit of advice.
2	The area you salvage in'll determine\nwhat you find.
3	And you'll find that some places are\nharder to salvage in than others.
4	If you can't find what you're looking\nfor in one place, try elsewhere.
5	Say I can't find something here up\non the Salvage Deck. I'll just head\nover to the Maelstrom instead.
6	Oh, and one more thing. Don't\nbe surprised if monsters end up\ncoming after you.
7	Sometimes you've gotta make a stand\nagainst the critters of the Cloud Sea\nif you want to get the good stuff.
tlk4570011103_ms.json
1	Got any of those Premium Cylinders?
2	Apparently salvaging with one of those\nwill bag you an incredible treasure\nevery single time!
3	Well, strictly speaking it's because they\nlet you search around in the Cloud Sea\nfor ages, until you find the best stuff.
4	The Argentum Guild can manufacture\nordinary cylinders, but nobody has the\ntechnology to make premium ones.
5	All the ones you see on the market\nwere made in ancient times. That's\nwhy they're so rare and expensive.
6	If you do have any, I'd suggest saving\nthem for when you really need them.
tlk4570011104_ms.json
1	I heard it's possible to salvage\neven from the World Tree itself!
2	Diving into the Cloud Sea from all\nthe way up there... Sounds scary!
3	But as a salvager, I'd sure like to\ntry it for myself someday.
4	Who knows what kind of rare\ntreasures you might be able to\nhaul up around those parts?
5	Stuff from the Land of Morytha...?\nHahah...I guess that's in bad taste.
tlk4570015101_ms.json
1	You'll need good cylinders if you\nwant to do well as a salvager.\nSee if anything catches your fancy.
tlk4570015201_ms.json
1	My name's Hamoosh. I'm with the\nLost Technology Bureau.
2	Our main job is to send salvaged\nitems over to the Technological\nResearch Center for proper analysis.
3	It's thanks to organized systems like\nthis that Mor Ardain boasts the highest\ntechnological standards in Alrest.
tlk4570015202_ms.json
1	It's not easy to find Silvery Pearl Gems,\neven around these parts.
2	We get a lot of Ancient Chalices,\nbut they don't really have much in\nthe way of technological merit.
3	They're more like art pieces, really.\nThey're these great big pearly-white\nvases, good for sticking flowers in.
4	The only thing that bugs me about\nthem is that they have lids attached\nfor some reason.
5	Incidentally, back when Senator\nRoderich was younger...
6	I heard he filled a whole Ancient\nChalice up with Steam-Gel Ice Cream\nand scoffed down the lot!
7	Can you imagine?\nI'm actually a little jealous...
tlk4571014101_ms.json
1	I heard all about Damida.\nAnd how I was under suspicion.
2	Don't worry, I'm not blaming you.\nYou did the rational thing.
3	Communicating isn't my strong point.\nI'm used to people getting the wrong\nend of the stick.
4	All I can do is prove my reliability\nby doing good work out in the field.\nA mercenary is judged by his skills.
tlk4571015301_ms.json
1	Hmm? Have we met somewhere\nbefore, perhaps?
2	Ah, the Chairman's office in Goldmouth.\nOf course, of course...
3	This is where I grew up, you know.\nI came back briefly to take care of\na small work-related matter...
4	And now that's all sorted, I'm enjoying\na sweet moment's rest.
5	I wouldn't recommend you stray too\nclose to Hardhaigh Palace, by the way.\nIt's just across that bridge there.
6	If you're lucky, you'd get turned away\nby the guards. If you're unlucky, you\nmight wind up in a cell.
tlk4571015302_ms.json
1	I'm afraid I don't know anything about\nany mechanical Blades.
2	Anyway, is it just me, or is the air\na little oppressive in this city?
3	There's sand blowing in from the\nwastes outside, and the natural steam\nmakes the atmosphere so humid...
4	I suppose I'm not used to my own\nhome after spending so long in\nGoldmouth.
5	Would you believe I'm missing the\nfresh air of my workplace?
tlk4571015303_ms.json
1	So I hear Chairman Bana has\ngone missing.
2	I'd rather not return to the Guild right\nnow for fear of getting mixed up in that\nmess. I think I might just stay here.
3	By the way, have you ever noticed\nthe strange inscriptions on the backs\nof the walls around here?
4	They've bothered me since I was a boy,\nbut now I have some free time, I might\nactually look into them.
5	Freedom is a wonderful thing, you\nknow? Without work to tie me down,\nit feels like the world is my oyster!
6	Though the lack of income could\nbe a small problem.
tlk4571015304_ms.json
1	You may not guess it to look at him,\nbut Chairman Bana was always very\ndevoted to his parents.
2	Yes, he definitely had a big heart.\nHe used to say he took after his\nfather in that regard.
3	But I can't deny he was unhealthily\nattached to money. He should have\nknown it would be his undoing...
4	Meanwhile, look at me! Now I've used\nup all my savings, I'm unemployed and\npenniless!
5	It's tough to find work in Alba Cavanich\nwhen you're used to the Argentum way\nof doing things. Should I head back...?
tlk4571015305_ms.json
1	Who could have predicted the world\nwould come to this?
2	But it's at times like this that we all\nneed to help each other out more\nthan ever. That's why I came here.
3	For some reason even the\nImperial Army are willing to\nlisten to what I have to say.
4	I'm glad I can be of help to everyone.
5	We'll be all right here, I'll make\nsure of it. So you can focus on\nsaving Alrest, eh?

2	Tensions are rising between\nUraya and Mor Ardain, but\nIndol is a safe haven.

4	Many citizens have begun to question\nour charity, saying that the refugees\nshould be made to work for their share.
tlk4632017102_ms.json
1	With Lady Fan's passing, there is much\nmourning even among the refugees.
2	She would often personally pay visits\nto the refugee camp when the Praetor\nwas too busy to attend to them.
3	I just hope this tragedy does not fan\nthe flames of the anti-Blade protests.\nErm, no pun intended, of course...

1	The ration distribution service is\nonly available during the daytime.
2	We've been trying to convince the\nbetter-off refugees to emigrate to other\nnations, but none of them are budging.
3	With our limited resources, it will be\ndifficult to keep supporting them all\nindefinitely...
tlk4632017104_ms.json
1	Did you know?
2	Word is that a massive fish has been\nspotted off Baldotas Isle in the\nLeftherian Archipelago.
3	I heard that this fish has the most\ndelicious taste out of all the Architect's\ncreations.
4	No wonder it's causing so much fuss!
5	Have to say, I can't stop thinking about\nit myself!
6	What I'd give for a taste...
7	But there's no way I could fish\nthat beast out by myself.
8	So, I'm on the lookout for someone to\nlend a hand, but no one seems to be\nup for it.
9	Can't pass over a chance like this\nthough, can we? Who knows when we'd\nget another shot at it!
10	Wow! You're going to help!\nYou're just the ticket!
11	Come on, we'll be gorging on roasted\nfish before long!
tlk4632017201_ms.json
1	You must be the party who were invited\nhere by His Eminence the Praetor.\nGood evening to you all.
2	If you seek an audience with\nHis Eminence, head for the Sanctum\non the far side of this plaza.
3	If you have time, I would recommend\ntaking a look at the Sanctum's famous\nmural of the creation of Alrest.
4	It is a priceless work of art unique\nto Indol. Many enjoy gazing upon it\nand contemplating the distant past.
tlk4632017202_ms.json
1	To think I will never again hear\nLady Fan's beautiful singing voice...
2	Sometimes at night, I would hear her\nsinging to herself, all alone.
3	They say her voice has the power to\nrestrain the power of Blades, but in my\ncase it brought tranquility to my heart...
4	Oh, but I shouldn't get distracted while\nI'm on guard duty! Excuse me, please.
tlk4632017203_ms.json
1	Entry to the Sanctum is currently\nrestricted.
2	You may be personal acquaintances\nof the Praetor, but I'm afraid rules are\nrules. We cannot allow you through.
3	Please come back another time.

1	I am preaching the teachings of Indol\nto all who are willing to listen.
2	As long as there is breath in your body,\nit is never too late to make a better\nlife for yourself.
3	The teachings of Praetor Amalthus\nsaved me from my own sin, and they\ncan do the same for you.
4	Now let us pray together and\nbuild a brighter future!
tlk4632017402_ms.json
1	Young Mololo is a wonderful disciple.\nI have never known another with a\nheart so pure and full of faith.
2	This is all thanks to the teachings\nof Indol with which Praetor Amalthus\nhas blessed us all.
3	Would you care to study his teachings\nwith me as well? It is never too late\nto build a brighter future!
4	I see... That is a shame.\nYou would make a worthy disciple,\nI feel, if you set your mind to it.

1	Welcome to Goetuis, the capital\nof the Praetorium of Indol.
2	The people of Indol live in peace and\nharmony thanks to the teachings of\nAmalthus, our beloved Praetor.
3	Perhaps most important is the teaching\nthat it is never too late for anyone, even\ncriminals, to repent and live a good life.
4	The belief that faith can save any soul\nand lead it down a brighter path is one\nI hold dear to my heart.
tlk4632027602_ms.json
1	Welcome to Goetuis, the capital\nof the Praetorium of Indol.
2	The people of Indol live in peace and\nharmony thanks to the teachings of\nAmalthus, our beloved Praetor.
3	Admittedly, our resources are\nsomewhat strained, due to the influx of\nrefugees and foreign pilgrims...
4	We appreciate your forbearance\nand do hope you'll enjoy your stay\nhere despite any inconvenience.
tlk4640007101_ms.json
1	This is the main entrance to Goetuis,\ncapital of the Praetorium of Indol.
2	Ascend the steps you see before you\nto reach Seoris Plaza.

tlk4640007102_ms.json
1	Lady Fan's funerary service was\nso solemn and grand...
2	I will probably never forget her\nbeauty, nor the pain of losing\nsuch a pure and noble soul.
3	I wonder what will become of Indol\nwithout Lady Fan...
4	I hope that the peace we enjoy will\ncontinue, but I cannot help but worry...
tlk4640007103_ms.json
1	Entry has recently been restricted to\na section of the Sanctum that used\nto be open to the general public.
2	I feel like Indol has started to head\ndown a worrying path ever since the\npassing of Lady Fan...
3	With the conflict between Mor Ardain\nand Uraya finally coming to an end,\nshouldn't things get more peaceful?
tlk4640007104_ms.json
1	Oh dear.\nThis is a bind...
2	Thing is, there's a wreck been\nwashed into the harbor.
3	And it's pretty big. Well, if the truth\nbe told, it's massive!
4	Not sure whether the lads can handle\nit by themselves...
5	But it needs getting rid of somehow,\nso I'm on the lookout for some\nspecialist help.
6	Whoever takes it on will need to be\nsuper strong, and there's just no one\nlike that round here...
7	Can't really ask the refugees for help\neither, so I really am in a bind.
8	Oh, really?
9	Oh, you'd help!\nThank you, that's be most appreciated.
10	I'm looking forward to seeing what\nyou can do!
tlk4640007201_ms.json

2	May the blessings of the Architect\nbe with you all.
3	I will remain here and pray\nfor your safe return.
tlk4640007605_ms.json
1	I believe the summit is to be held\njust beyond the audience chamber.
2	Blessings be with you.
3	I cannot believe that\nLady Fan has gone...
4	When she appeared with your good\nselves the other day, I had no idea\nthat such a thing could come to pass.
5	Indeed, I still struggle to believe it...
tlk4640007607_ms.json
1	Ah, hello again!
2	I'm very sorry, but only guests\nwith special permission are\npermitted to stay here.
3	Might I suggest you stay at the inn\nin Goetuis Port instead?
4	I look forward to the day when I can\nwelcome you here once more.\nBlessings be with you.
tlk4640007801_ms.json
1	For many years we have followed\nwithout question the path the Praetor\nhas decreed for us.
2	But all these refugees...\nI mean, it's not the welcoming of the\nrefugees itself that I object to, exactly.
3	But the camp where they all currently\nreside, it used to be a beautiful plaza\nwith fountains, and, well, look at it now.
4	If only there were more land in Indol,\nwe might be able to at least build them\nproper houses to live in...
tlk4640007802_ms.json
1	I was just remembering how\nkindly Lady Fan used to treat\nall the refugees...
2	I cannot understand how anyone could\nbring themselves to take the life of such\na kind and noble soul.
3	It feels as though the Indol I know\nand love is gradually slipping away...\nIt scares me a little.
tlk4640007803_ms.json
1	Since Lady Fan passed away, I feel\nthe people have grown less accepting\nof the refugees.
2	Perhaps it is only human nature.\nWhen we feel sadness or frustration,\nwe lash out at the nearest targets.
3	I only hope that the people of Indol\ncan hold on to the ideals of harmony\nand forgiveness that define this nation.
tlk4640007901_ms.json
1	Welcome to Seoris Plaza, the heart\nof the Praetorium of Indol.
2	The plaza is open to citizens and\nvisitors alike, as a place for rest\nand recreation.
3	Some use it to practice singing holy\nsongs, some to educate our younger\ncitizens, some simply to sit and pray.
4	All living together in harmony, as\nHis Eminence the Praetor has ordained.
tlk4640007902_ms.json
1	With the summit over, the emergency\nsecurity measures have been lifted.
2	However, I feel there is still tension\nhanging in the air of the city.
3	Even the holy songs that ring out\nthrough the plaza sound somehow\nstrained to my ears today.

1	Hmm... Mmmmnnhhhh... How should\nI go about carving from here...?
2	Oh, hello. My name's Gianluca,\nand I'm working on this sculpture.
3	I started out determined to carve\nthe finest sculpture in all of Alrest, but\nafter 20 years, I still haven't finished it.
4	At this point, my life's goal is to finish\nthis masterpiece before I die! But I'm\nso torn over how best to proceed...
tlk4650017102_ms.json
1	Whew! A Frozen Odifa after a hard\nday's work really hits the spot!
2	During the day, I'm working on a\nsculpture, but I spend the whole time\nagonizing over how best to proceed.
3	When I was younger, I could decide\non a direction and carve it out in a few\nshort days, but age does take its toll...
4	Why don't you have an Odifa too?\nIt'll lift your spirits, I promise you!
tlk4650017103_ms.json
1	I still have trouble believing that\nLady Fan is no longer with us...
2	I was hoping to break out of my slump\ntoday and get back to carving my\nsculpture, but my spirit is still dashed...
3	When I'm feeling down, the only\nthing that can lift my spirits is a\nswig of sweet Odifa.
4	You should have some too.\nIt'll help, I promise.

tlk4650017402_ms.json
1	Oh, the tragedy of it all...
2	To think the day would come when I\nwould have to enter the date of Lady\nFan's death into the annals of Indol...
3	The children loved her so.\nI don't think they really understand\nyet that she is gone forever...
4	And we will never again hear her\nbeautiful voice ring out in song...

1	Now, this is a pain...
2	They've only gone and stolen some of\nthe Taminbi roots I've been growing.
3	Taminbi roots are so nutritious and\nare prized for their medicinal uses.
4	Only a few were stolen, so it's not that\nbig a deal, but...
5	I reckon it was just some kids playing\ntricks. If so, they really need to be\ntaught what's right and what's wrong!
6	That's why I'm looking for help\nfinding the suspects.
7	That's the spirit!
8	You're such a good help!

1	Why, it's our true hero's warrior troupe!
2	I heard you saved some of our kind on\nLeftheria.
3	I always thought humans only cared\nfor their own kind...
4	It's very admirable of you!
tlk4710001201_ms.json
1	Wow. Ever since I came here, I've had\nnothing but fun!
2	Everyone's been fawning over me\nand giving me free food...
3	Phonexes are easily pleased. Give\nus tasty treats and suddenly, we're\nyour best friend.
4	We have different tastes depending\non our homeland, though.\nJust remember that.
tlk4710001202_ms.json
1	Hey, if it isn't the true hero's warrior\ntroupe!
2	We get shuttled around a lot on\nvoyages along with our Nopon\nmasters.
3	But once we settle down and make\na den, we'll stay there for the rest\nof our lives.
4	So you can imagine why I'm so\nimpressed that you people travel\nall around the world!

2	You don't normally see us fitting in\nwith humans.
3	In fact, I don't think you'll find anyone\nbesides me here in Fonsa Myma.
4	I don't really see what's so great about\nhaving to forage for food and eat yucky\nplants all the time.
5	No, I'd much prefer lapping up the\nlife of luxury here!
6	There are lots of big brawny Urayans\nthat take good care of me. They feed\nevery day without fail.

3	And here I thought that the\nPhonexes on the outside were\nall country bumpkins...
4	I suppose the kids on Argentum think\nthe same of me.

1	They say the people of old must have\nwalked up these stairs to Fonsa Myma.
2	But ever since fluctuations within the\nTitan formed the waters here, we've\nhad to use Funnystone Highway.
3	After that, the residential and\nentertainment districts were built over\nthat way, and naturally, they flourished.
4	It's nice that it's so peaceful and quiet\nhere, but it gets a little lonely...
tlk4710004202_ms.json
1	Well! Never in a million years did I think\nthat I would meet the true heroes here!\nIt is such an honor to meet you!
2	Ever since your heroic deeds, Phonex\nhave started leaving their territory to\nexplore, so word has started to travel!

4	Vandham's just a name that he\nborrowed from a famous person that\nhe looked up to as a kid.

tlk4720016102_ms.json
1	Whew! I'm taking a break from\nfetching water.
2	I was carrying so much water\nI was starting to overheat there.\nWish I could just dive straight in!
3	But you're not supposed to muddy\nthe water here and the lake at\nGodsford Isle's full of monsters...
4	There's plenty of water in Uraya, right?\nWish I was there now. Then I could just\nswim all day...

1	アーケディアに行っていた神学校の子供達が\n村に帰ってきたみたい
2	せっかく村から出れたのにもったいないよね\n一体何があったんだろ？

1	Hey, Rex! I heard you came back with\na bunch of cute girls!
2	You lucky duck... Are salvagers really\nthat popular around Argentum?
3	I'm not doing too badly myself,\nsurrounded by all these old dames...\nWhat?! Don't give me that look!
4	Everything's nice and quiet here in\nFonsett. As per usual!
5	Sometimes a few stray Kapiba wander\ninto the village, but that's about all the\nexcitement we get round here.
6	Probably not to the taste of a young'un\nlike Rex, but he'll come to\nappreciate it when he's my age.
7	My only grumble is that we don't have\na pub!
tlk4730016102_ms.json
1	'Lo there, Rex!\nHere to visit us again? Auntie Corinne'll\nbe dead chuffed!
2	You're off to see the Village Guardian?!\nWhat, again? What for, eh?
3	Azurda's old enough to remember...
4	There's some mysterious stuff round\nthere... Stuff I don't know about!
tlk4730016103_ms.json
1	The Indoline Praetorium's gone?\nElysium's sakes, that's awful.
2	Mark was supposed to be going to\nschool there, you know.
3	It'll be Torna's doing. They're the\nones ruining everything.
4	Indol brought it upon themselves? Heh,\nthat's what the gossipers around here\nare saying too... Sounds complicated.
tlk4730016104_ms.json
1	Hey...\nYou heard about Kisra on Emi Island?
2	Apparently they've got a bit of a\nDringworm problem there.
3	You've never heard of it?!
4	Listen up! Dringworms are those nasty\nshelled beasties that feed on Titans.\nThought everybody knew that...
5	Few hundred years back, they filled an\nisland with holes and it sank into the\nCloud Sea!
6	They need clearing out sharpish, but\ndoubt there's anybody in Leftheria\nwho's capable...
7	Wow! You'll do it?!
8	Great! This mission's a tough one, so\ndon't take any chances, OK?
tlk4730016201_ms.json
1	So! Our village's biggest success story,\nthe great Rex, is back in town for once!
2	What d'you think? Good wood, isn't it?\nLeftheria's not got many trees, so we\nmake the most of the ones we do have.
3	Same goes for the buildings an' all.\nWe fix 'em up, so they're in a decent\nstate for the next generation.
4	That one at the edge of town's getting\nold, mind. We'll use it for storage or\nsummat, I reckon. Not sure yet, though.
tlk4730016202_ms.json
1	Good to have you back, Rex! You\nknow we're all proper proud of you.\nWhat brings you back so soon?
2	The Village Guardian? Well, I'd be\ncareful if I were you.
3	There're some ridiculously strong\nmonsters roaming around them parts.\nBut I'm sure you're capable enough.
4	Monsters have never shown up here.\nI don't even want to imagine things\nlurking beneath the village...
5	If you're going to see the Village\nGuardian, you'd better be careful.
6	There're some ridiculously strong\nmonsters roaming around them parts.\nBut I'm sure you're capable enough.
7	Monsters have never shown up here.\nI don't even want to imagine things\nlurking beneath the village...
8	Oh, you lot! Still got a bit of business\nto take care of have you?
tlk4730016203_ms.json
1	Tantal and Mor Ardain are headed\ntowards the World Tree, right?
2	At least Leftheria's staying where it is.
3	I guess that's because there's no one\nin control of one specific Titan here.\nI really hope things settle down soon...
tlk4730016301_ms.json
1	Poor old Leftheria doesn't have nearly\nas much soil and greenery as other\nTitans.
2	It's hard to come by veg if you don't\ngrow some yourself.
3	I remember you used to help out in the\nfield back when you were small, Rex.\nYou were a good little tyke...
4	I bet Rex hasn't told you all how he\nused to help out in the fields when he\nwas little. A good little tyke, he was!
tlk4730016302_ms.json
1	I look after my veggies like they're my\nown flesh and blood.
2	You know that Braised Cloud Sea\nShark dish Corinne likes to make?
3	Take note of the seasoning,\nbecause it's my herbs that give\nit that special oomph!
4	I'm a firm believer that feeding a child\nhis greens makes him grow up good.\nAnd our Rex is living proof, eh?
tlk4730016303_ms.json
1	何か重大な事を為す気じゃな？\nオヌシ達の目を見れば歴然じゃわい
2	そんなオヌシ達にオススメする野菜は\nワシの畑でも採れるスタミ・ナスじゃ

tlk4730016304_ms.json
1	Hmph...
2	Doesn't matter how much we clear up\nthese pests, they're back before you\nknow it.
3	So I've been thinking about cooking up\nsome special pesticide to protect the\nfields with.
4	But getting hold of the ingredients\nis a bit tricky...
5	I'd need some Uluran Grady ooze and\nsome fruit...
6	I can sort the fruit, no problem. It's\nthat Uluran Grady ooze that's the\ntricky thing...
7	Was thinking about getting some mercs\nin on the job...
8	Oh! You'll go and get some? For me?\nWhat a star!
9	Just what I need for the pesticide!
tlk4730016401_ms.json
1	*yaaaawn* Another peaceful day...\nOh! Outsiders! This is a surprise!
2	We split up the work between us here\nin the village. I do the nightly rounds.
3	There's your odd Bunnit that creeps\nin, but aside from that, it's not very\neventful. All the better, really.
4	Rex? Is that you?! You've grown\nsince I last saw you!
5	Haha... I suppose I have, yeah!
6	Corinne's been worrying her head off\nabout you. Whether you're eating OK,\nhoping you didn't get swindled...
7	But I can see you're perfectly fine! And\nyou made a nice circle of friends too,\nso that should put her mind at ease!
tlk4730016402_ms.json
1	Everything's the same as always here,\nbut it's like there's some great invisible\nshadow looming. I've got a bad feeling...
2	I've heard that Torna are responsible\nfor terrible wrongdoings, but do they\nhave anything to gain by coming here?
3	There are no soldiers here. We can't\nfight them like Mor Ardain. All we can\ndo now is pray to the Village Guardian...
tlk4730016403_ms.json

tlk4730016404_ms.json
1	Hey! Listen up!\nI've seen something!
2	I saw some shadowy folk gathered\nin the middle of the night in a spot just\noutside Fonsett.
3	At least I think they were people...\nCould have been animals too...\nBit bigger than a Nopon, I reckon.
4	Can't bear to think that a quiet village\nlike Fonsett might be attacked...\nThat'd be beyond the pale!
5	Till we find out what's going on, I'd like\nsome more guards to help protect the\nvillage...
6	You'll do it?!\nOh, that's a relief!
7	Take care while you're on duty!

1	Eyup, pal!\nI'm wondering what we're supposed\nto do with this building here.
2	It's looking the worse for wear, so it\nneeds repairing, that's for sure. The\nquestion is, how?
3	Could use it for storage, but it's a bit of\na waste. Thing is, if we turn it into a\nhouse, then there's no one to live in it!
4	Unless of course you decided to\nsettle down with a nice lass, Rex.\nThat'd solve all our problems!
5	Unless of course Rex decides to\nsettle down with a nice lass.\nThat'd solve all our problems!
tlk4730016802_ms.json
1	Eyup, pal! I was just basking in awe\nat the amazing thing we've achieved\nhere with this new school!
2	Reinforcing the walls and fixing leaks\nin the roof together with the kids were\nsome real moments to be treasured...
3	Oof! I almost forgot, we've got new\nfaces now, don't we? Looks like it's\ntime for an extension then!
tlk4730016901_ms.json
1	You can get to Mor Ardain from Rigitte\nHarbor, and there's a regular service\nto Indol here at Ysheva Harbor.
2	I say "regular," but they can delay\nthe journey a fair bit if you aren't\ncarrying a certain amount of cargo.
3	We could really do with a proper\nservice.
tlk4730016902_ms.json
1	Finally, we have a direct, regular\nservice to Argentum from Ysheva\nHarbor!
2	You can get practically anything you\nwant from Argentum, and get anywhere\ntoo. It opens up so many possibilities!
3	Whoever it was that started the\nnew route, thank you, thank you,\nthank you!
tlk4730019101_ms.json

2	Kind of you to drop by, Boss!\nYou'll be wanting to stock up\nlike usual, I suppose?
tlk4740016401_ms.json
1	The Cloud Ridge's as tall as ever...
2	You can't see it, but the Leftherian\nTitan's in there somewhere.
3	If only it would just come out,\nwe could all live on its back...
4	But unlike other countries, it's a free\nTitan. It just wanders around pulling\nsmaller island Titans along with it.
tlk4740016402_ms.json
1	Sometimes you can see the aurora\nfrom here. It's pretty, for sure...
2	But there are monsters that only come\nout when the aurora's around.
3	Like Drac Lexos and Selmo Gradys...
4	I wonder why they only come out\nwhen there's an aurora, though?\nFunny creatures.

1	I might just be imagining things...\nbut I could have sworn I heard odd\nnoises out on the Lud Cloudway.
2	They say the sounds are just a\nmonster's call, but I'm not so sure\nmyself.
3	I mean, it's not like anyone's heard\nthese kinds of sounds before!
4	It's getting to the point where I\ncan't sleep for thinking about it.
5	Really? You'll set up watch\nand investigate for me?

2	I think it's wonderful that she was able\nto live her entire life in the village she\nwas born.
3	Nowadays, you've got all these wars\ngoing on. You never know when we\nmight get wrapped up in it all...
4	Rex? Don't waste your life in vain, do\nyou hear? For Corinne, and for your\nparents, Architect bless their souls.

2	I want you to fetch some flowers for\nmy wife's grave.
3	Course, they're not flowers you can get\nround here. They're a special blue\nflower only found on Lonaria Island.
4	She used to love those flowers best of\nall, but I'm too long in the tooth to\ngo fetching them.
5	I'm sure strapping youths such as you,\nshouldn't have any problem though.
6	Will you help me out?

3	You've grown into a splendid young\nman yourself, Rex. I can attest to that.
4	We don't often see Driver folks in\nthese parts! When was the last time,\nI wonder.
5	We get a good few merchants stopping\nby though. Because of the port, see.
6	Aye, it's nothing fancy, but it's our\nhome, and you're very welcome!
tlk4750016502_ms.json
1	Hmm... Let me indulge you in\na story from years back.
2	I'm sure you're well aware of the\nstone monument at the village outskirts,\nour resident Village Guardian?
3	Beneath that lies the resting place of\nAddam.
4	It's his blessing that has protected us\nfrom strife and allowed us to live in\na state of peace and tranquility.
5	The King of Tantal claims to have\nbeen descended from Addam, but in\nactual fact, he's not blood-related.
6	What?! You already knew that?\nWell, you're more versed in the ways\nof the world than this old geezer...
tlk4750016503_ms.json
1	Never thought I'd see the day we'd\nhave bright-eyed kids studying away\nin the village.
2	I think someday, this place will be\nprestigious enough to rival Indol's\nold academy...
3	You're the pride of the village,\nyou lot are. The magnificent Rex\nand his fine companions!
tlk4750016601_ms.json
1	Hi there. If you're looking for passage\nto Mor Ardain, you should catch a ship\nat Rigitte Harbor.
2	Ysheva Harbor is for ships to the\nPraetorium, but those don't go very\noften, only once every five days.
3	I recommend staying a while in\nFonsett over on the neighboring island.\nIt's the perfect place to unwind.
tlk4750016603_ms.json
1	I saw a funny-looking pair get off one\nof the Praetorium ships.
2	They sat down here like they were\nexpecting someone to turn up.\nWonder if they ever did...?
3	The two of them almost never shut up.\nThe port's usually so quiet, it was nice\nto have some banter for a change.
4	Hmm? Hold on...it's you! Hahaha!\nI had a right laugh at some of your\nconversation! Comedy gold!
tlk4750016604_ms.json

1	Ahh, feel that breeze...\nIt reminds me of the time I was riding\non the back of Azurda.
2	It was a while back now.\nThe old fellow asked if I'd like to go\non a long-haul journey with him.
3	I'd never been outside the village\nbefore, so it was quite the journey of\ndiscovery, seeing all those islands!
4	He asked if I wanted to keep on with it,\nbut it turned out I got seasick easily,\nso I let a certain someone take over.
tlk4760016502_ms.json
1	Ahh, what lovely weather we're\nhaving... It reminds me of the time\nI went inside the Village Guardian.
2	When I finally came out of the pitch\ndarkness into the daylight, it felt as\nif I was being reborn...
3	Oh yes, that's actually why I left a\nbunch of lamps in there, so it would\nbe easier to find your way around.
4	Just be careful in there. If it's looking\nhairy, you come straight back out,\nyou hear?
tlk4760016503_ms.json
1	Ahh, such an earthy smell...\nIt reminds me of that time a girl\narrived at the village.
2	She was awfully haggard, all covered\nin dirt and grime...but the child in her\narms was as healthy as could be.
3	I still don't know where she came from.\nI'd never seen clothes like that anywh...\nWait...perhaps I have...
4	Hmm, I'm afraid I don't remember all\nthat clearly. It was the child that really\ncaught my attention...
tlk49100101_ms.json
1	Thanks for helping with all my\nselfish requests!
2	I really owe you guys. After all, it's\nthanks to you I met KOS-MOS, too!
3	Maybe we can go adventuring again\nsometime! Like, after you're done\nsaving Alrest and all that.
4	And you'd better bring KOS-MOS\nwhen we do! It's a promise, OK?
5	With the Aux Cores I made for her\nequipped, KOS-MOS ought to be\nthe ultimate Blade!
6	Saving Alrest will be child's play\nwith her on your side.
7	So you go take care of that, then\nbring KOS-MOS back to see me!

2	Oh, are you interested in my\nwares, my dear?
3	Mmmmm...not exactly.\nJust thought they looked kind of cool.
4	To hear young people admire my\nworks is what makes all the trouble\nof weaving them worthwhile!
5	Are these hard to make, then?
6	Would you like to try your hand at it?
7	I was just thinking, you've got a pretty\nnice style going, but they're not quite\nup to the standards I'm really after.
8	Hohoh... You're a cheeky one!
9	That does it, I'm teaching you.\nDrop by my house whenever you\nhave the time, you hear?
10	Well, thanks.
11	Well, looks like I'm going to try\nmy hand at a spot of weaving.

13	You're pretty into cute clothes\nand stuff, huh? Well, good luck!
14	Tora suddenly have power of foresight.\nSee Vale epic fail at weaving.\nVale get mad and snap loom in half.

3	Sorry, it's just... That Core Crystal\nwas displayed in our shop for ages,\nso seeing it finally come to life...
4	It's still kind of surreal, you know?\nOh, I'm loving the whole always-in-the-\nbath thing, by the way. Very hygienic.
5	Are you making fun of us, peon?
6	N-not at all!
7	So pray tell, did you want\nsomething of us?
8	Oh yeah, right.\nMy grandpa made a promise with you\nwhen he was younger, you see.
9	A promise, you say?
10	He said that if he managed to sell your\nCore Crystal for half a million G, he'd\ngive half the proceeds back to you.
11	Does this mean 250 thousand G\nis ours for the taking?
12	That's the long and short of it,\nridiculous though it may be...
13	Truly, our former self was a genius!\nA queen among queens!
14	My grandpa was always grumbling\nabout that promise, though. Said a rock\nlike this would never sell for that price.
15	And he had a point.\nI mean, two generations later and\nthe thing was STILL on display.
16	But a buyer appeared in the end,\ndid they not? And now you are\n250 thousand G the richer!
17	Perhaps you should have priced\nit at five million G instead.
18	Doubtless our Driver would have paid\nup regardless of the asking price!
19	Hahaha!
20	...This is quite the Blade you've\ngot your hands on.

5	So I feel like I've gotta take\nextra good care of him.
6	Hey, you're Drivers, right?
7	If you've got time to spare, would you\nhelp me look after the calf?
8	You don't have to do much, just give\nhim a feed every once in a while.
9	I don't really have any reward to offer,\nbut looking after an animal might make\na nice change from battling for you!
10	And interacting with all kinds of\ndifferent people should help him\ngrow up big and strong.
11	Well, come round any time!
12	Oh, have you brought some food\nfor the Ardun?

21	He has a huge appetite, too.\nIf you have anything to give him,\nbe my guest!
22	Oh, have you brought some food\nfor the Ardun?
23	Thanks to all your help, he might\njust become the strongest Ardun\nin all of Gormott.
24	Maybe I should give him a name\nof his very own...
25	I've been watching Ardun grow\nsince the day I was born...
26	But never in all my years have I seen\none grow up this strong. He doesn't\neven need anyone to feed him now!
27	But listen, I came up with a\nspecial name for him.
28	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Relentless Arduran!
29	[ML:Feeling ]What d'you think? Cool, right?
30	Feel free to spend some time with\nRelentless Arduran if you like!
31	Just try not to get too\ncarried away, OK?
tlk500702_ms.json
1	So...you slaughtered that Ardun\nwe were raising, huh?
2	Well, I'm sure you had your reasons...\nMaybe you wanted to steal his horns\nor his hooves for something.
3	No, I'm not blaming you really...
4	This is a farm, we'll have plenty more\nArdun calves to raise...
5	But maybe I won't ask you to help\ntake care of them in future.
6	Wow... So you defeated\nRelentless Arduran, huh?
7	It's OK, I don't blame you for it.\nThis is a farm, we have to say goodbye\nto all our animals sooner or later.
8	Thanks to you guys, he got big and\nstrong. And I'd say he had a chance to\nexpress himself at the end of his life.
9	I think he'll have been satisfied to\ngo out fighting such a worthy foe.\nI know I'm proud of you both.
10	He'll live on in our hearts and our\nmemories, so we don't need to feel sad.
11	In a way he's always close by.\nI'm sure he'd love it if you came by\nto visit sometime!
12	Hey there! Our old pal's still\ndoing just fine.

2	Anyone who not yet register for\nauction, please sign up quick-quick!
3	All participating must bring minimum\nof 30,000G! This absolute rule!
4	Anyone not having enough golds not\nallowed to take part! Would not be\nable to win bidding anyway.
5	Looks like friends have enough gold.\nNow must decide group representative\nfor bidding.
6	Many antique books in auction today,\nso suggest friends bring someone who\nlike that kind of thing.
7	If friends not have someone who want\nto obtain books at any cost, really no\npoint in taking part!
8	Meh-meh? Me spy budding bidder\nwith shiny glint in eye.
9	Maybe today be very good auction!
tlk501802_ms.json
1	What I'm looking out for in this\nauction is a Tome of Morytha.
2	Most of the tomes in the auction are\nwritten in Ancient Nopon, but there's a\nrumor a Morythan tome might show up!
3	With all the money you've brought,\nI bet I can win against anyone else\nfoolish enough to bid for it!
4	Looks like it's about to begin.
5	Ooh, I'm getting a little nervous...
6	Next item is this Tome of Morytha!
7	Full of strange symbols nobody can\nread! Text completely useless!
8	Tome itself quite heavy though,\nso maybe useful as doorstop.
9	Start bidding at 1G!
10	2G!
11	3G!
12	10G!
13	Oohhhh!
14	I'm not a fan of Nopon auctions.\nThey're always so lazily-paced.
15	Everyone's reluctant to raise the bid\nbecause they want to get things for\nas cheap as they possibly can.
16	But I want that tome no matter what!
17	You know how much we ought\nto bid, right? Let's finish this in\none fell swoop!
18	How much should we bid?
19	30G!
20	Meh-meh?!
21	Whoaaaa!
22	Outrageous!
23	Hate to admit defeat,\nbut 20G was limit for me...
24	3,000G!
25	No way?!
26	Whoaaaa!
27	Such big leap up!\nNever see anything like it!
28	Me can not possibly compete with that.
29	30,000G!
30	Meh-meh-meh-meeeehhhhhhh?!
31	You sure not add zero by accident?!
32	What kind of nincompoop pays\n30,000 for doorstop?!
33	What so great about book\nnobody can read?
34	Heheh! Sounds like the words\nof a bunch of sore losers to me!
35	Going...going...gone!\nTome of Morytha goes to\nhigh-bidding Blade over there!
36	Hahah! Thanks for that.\nThis is just what I wanted!
37	I was impressed by your decision,\nby the way.
38	Personally, I thought we'd have to go\nup to about 100,000G to satisfy them.
39	Looks like you got us a real bargain!
40	Don't bid
41	Hey, c'mon... Really?
42	We've come this far, so you have to\nstay committed!
tlk501803_ms.json
1	How terrible... That precious tome...\nI must apologize to my client...
2	Oh, hello there. Who are you?\nAre you acquainted with a Blade\nnamed Adenine, by any chance?
3	There's something I need to tell her,\nso if you could bring her to me,\nI would be most grateful.
4	The ship which was supposed to be\ndelivering a Tome of Morytha was\nsunk in the waters near Gormott.
5	You might be able to salvage it near\nUmon's Shipyard. There's no guarantee\nthough.
tlk501804_ms.json
1	Ah, you must be Adenine.
2	That's right. Are you here to\ndeliver the Tome of Morytha\nI ordered?
3	No...actually, I was the Tome's\nprevious owner.
4	Oh, really? What, you came to\nbring it to me personally?
5	I'm so sorry...
6	It seems...the Tome may have been\nlost in transit from Mor Ardain.
7	What?
8	Well, not so much "lost" as...the\nentire vessel carrying the delivery\nmay have been shipwrecked.
9	That's awful!
10	Upon receiving your letter, I entrusted\nthe Tome to a courier so that it might\nreach Argentum as quickly as possible.
11	But the courier ship got attacked by\nmonsters and sank, or something?
12	Precisely...
13	You sounded so very enthusiastic in\nyour letter, so I felt I had to apologize\npersonally for this regrettable loss...
14	Hey, it's not your fault!\nIt's the monsters or the courier\nwho are to blame.
15	You are more gracious than I deserve.
16	But will this not present a terrible\nobstacle to your research...?
17	Don't worry! I happen to be acquainted\nwith a very accomplished salvager.
18	Do you know whereabouts it was\nthe ship sank?
19	I've heard it was around Umon's\nShipyard in Gormott.
20	All right, then. If we know the location,\nthat ought to be enough!
21	Thanks for letting us know, Tevissa!
22	Oh, it's the least I could do.\nI'm just glad I was able to make up\nfor your loss, if only a little.
tlk501805_ms.json
1	Me supposed to be giving Tome of\nMorytha to some strange Blade.
2	Blade is friend of yours?
3	Pleasure to meet you.\nMe name of Krezzi Temtem.
4	People always tell me is strange name\nfor Nopon, but me quite fond of its\nunusual flavor.
5	Anyway, me sent letter to strange\nBlade, but have no intention of\nhanding over Tome for free.
6	Krezzi is greatest collector of unusual\nitems in all Tantal. Only willing to trade\nfor other rare and interesting item!
7	When judging rare and unusual items,\nme always quantify exact numerical\nExcitement Quotient.
8	This because Krezzi only desire items\nthat make heart go pitter-pat and leap\nwith excitement!
9	So yes. Friends bring items with\nExcitement Quotient exceeding 100.\nThen we trade.
10	Friends bring items with Excitement\nQuotient exceeding 100 yet?
11	Krezzi warn friends, me very\nconnoisseur of unusual items.\nNot excite for just any old thing.
12	Oh dear, oh dear.\nThis no good at all.
13	Friends must bring most very\nincredible item, likes of which\nKrezzi has never seen!
14	O-oh my wings! How eccentric!
15	Me has never seen such avant-garde\ncombination! Such artistic innovation!\nImpact takes breath away!
16	Whew... Heart of Krezzi went pitter-pat\nand loop-the-loop all right.
17	Me go home right away, mount this\nnext to fireplace, and call all friends\nround to admire!
18	Here is promised item in exchange.\nOne Tome of Morytha.
19	Krezzi was going to collect all Tomes\nby self, but hear strange Blade already\nhave three, so better to hand over.
20	Hoping strange Blade have plenty\nof luck deciphering Tomes!

2	I've seen careless tourists miss the\nmark with 1G or 5G before, but a\nwhole 500G? That's a first!
3	Must've been some silly nouveau riche\ntourists who never do any exercise.
4	Though of course, from where we're\nstanding, they're basically gods!
5	Dropping blessings of money\nfrom on high! Literally!
6	Even splitting it between us,\nI'll have enough to let my old man\nand my sister eat their fill for once!
7	So thank you, whoever you are!
tlk501904_ms.json
1	Thank you for all help last time.
2	Me training like mad now to become\ngreat Nopon Sage!
3	No time for work. No time for study.\nSpending all day and night in deep\nmeditation to reach enlightenment!
4	So...would quite appreciate offerings.
5	No, no! No need to hesitate so long!
6	Me not care much what friends\noffer! Any food at all bring great\nhappiness to me!
7	Ahhhh, that so tasty-tasty!
8	Stomach very satisfied now!\nThanks be to friends!
9	Oh, yes!
10	Soon me planning to leave Tantal.
11	Hoping to achieve enlightenment\nin place where me can receive many\nofferings of food like just now!
12	Some place with much dense trees\nand big waterfall, lake of clean water...
13	Hopefully find dream place like that!\nAnyway, see friends around!
14	Stomach rumbling like fierce animal...
15	At this rate, me reach afterlife\nbefore reach enlightenment...

3	Well, I guess we got a lot of use out\nof it, for something we got for free.
4	Now, I'm not gonna let this get me\ndown, you know. I'll just enjoy myself\nfishing instead.
5	But my pal I always played it with?\nHe's getting pretty depressed.
6	So I figure, I'd better catch a big one,\nand hope it cheers my friend right up!
7	Hang on, is that...?!
8	That's a Nopon Chess Set!\nAnd made of coral, even!
9	Wow, I'm really jealous...\nThose only came out just recently!
10	Give him the Coral Nopon Chess Set?
11	Yes
12	No
13	Really?! I can have it?!
14	Wow, thanks!
15	My dad's a soldier, so he never\ncomes home lately.
16	And my mom won't give me any\npocket money, 'cos she wants to\nsave up cash in case war breaks out.
17	And I mean, we live on Torika Alley,\nso we were never exactly well off\nto begin with...
18	Seriously, thanks for this!\nMe and my pal will treasure it forever!
19	Ohhhhh... What I wouldn't\ngive for one of those!
20	One day, I'm gonna get stinking rich\nand buy a Coral Nopon Chess Set\nof my very own!

1	The Cloud Sea's great, don't you think?
2	It's so huge and beautiful...
3	I want to become a salvager, you know.
4	I got to try it out once, years back!\nDidn't find anything, even though\nthey let me use a Silver Cylinder...
5	But even so, it was so much fun!
6	Don't you think it'd be great\nto be able to do a job you enjoy\nin a place you love?
7	How best to respond?
8	Agree that it's a wonderful thing
9	Say you're not so sure
10	I know, right?
11	...It's just a dream for me right now,\nthough. My family don't have the cash\nto buy any salvaging gear.
12	Give him a Golden Cylinder?
13	Yes
14	No
15	A Golden Cylinder...\nFor me? Really?!
16	I don't even know how many years\nit would take me to earn the money\nfor something like this...
17	Just looking at it is making me want\nto become a salvager even more...
18	Yeah, someday I'll use this and\nsalvage something really good.
19	I'll haul up some incredibly rare\ntreasure, sell it off in Argentum...
20	And use that money to buy a house\nin Gormott where we can all live!
21	Gotta keep dreaming big, right...?
22	Thank you so much for this!\nI swear I'll become a salvager someday!
23	I guess you have a point...\nThe jobs you really want to do aren't\nalways the best ones for your life...

4	Well, maybe that would be too much...
5	Hey, excuse me!
6	How can I help you, young lady?
7	Don't you ever think about the effect\nsuch harsh treatment would have on\nthem?
8	They need a little bit of praise now and\nagain. Doing something for no reward\ncan be pretty rough, you know!
9	You say that... But if we don't put this\nlot through hell, they won't be able to\nstand up to Uraya...
10	Gormott is blessed with a lot of lovely\ntrees. You should take a moment to\ncontemplate them sometime!
11	I bet that'll be just the kind of\npick-me-up you need to clear your\nmind.
12	Hey, maybe you're right.\nIt's good to put your thinking cap on\nin a new location!
13	Haha, you're a sensitive soul, aren't\nyou, young lady! And very kind to chat\nwith an old thing like me.
14	Well, you just seemed like you were\nbrooding over something.
15	Well, speaking to a girl like you is like\na nice change, and soothing to the\nspirit!
16	It's only a silly little thing, but here,\nhave this!
17	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Huh?\nYeah!
18	Ah, I don't have time for that.
19	I need to come up with a decent\ntraining plan for this lot, sharpish!

2	Yeah. What about it?
3	Have you been a mercenary for a\nwhile.
4	A fair while, I guess.
5	I bet you've got a ton of cool stories\nabout life as fighter-for-hire!
6	Hmmm... Lemme think...
7	Tell me about...the job that you earned\nthe most money on!
8	Ah...Well, that's easy...
9	You know the mine\nnear Fonsa Myma?
10	Yeah, I know it.
11	Back in the day, they used to mine\nsome real valuable stuff out of there...
12	Really? Wow!
13	But one time a bunch of monsters\nmade a nest down there. So we got\nasked to go and clear 'em out!
14	The folks who were mining out of\nthere were making top-dollar. So the\npay packet was pretty nice!
15	Yeah, they're a pretty influential bunch,\nI guess.
16	We took care of 'em and cleaned the\nplace up, but in no time at all, the little\nbastards set up shop there again!
17	It's like they didn't know when to\nquit. We'd bash 'em up, and then\nthey'd be back for more.
18	Didn't matter to us. Every time we\ncut 'em down to size - Kerching!
19	Cool!
20	And we got paid like twenty times,\nthanks to those monsters!
21	On the 21st time... Well, the quarry\nfell in, 'cos of all the fighting.\nThat's how bad-ass we are!
22	You've really got a colorful history...
23	Ah, I got all giddy talking about it\nthere!
24	No worries! It's really awesome to\nthink about it!
25	Hey, did you ever take any of the ore\nfrom that mine, back in the day?
26	Yeah, I still have some. You want it?
27	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Huh?\nYeah!
28	Sorry, I don't feel like talking about it.

5	Yeah! I love 'em, and I like to play with\nthem! And you can find 'em anywhere,\nso you can play anywhere!
6	Yes indeed!
7	Shall we make one each? Then we'd\nbe like sisters with matching crowns!
8	Ah, no. I'll give it a miss.
9	OK... Well, I'll give you this anyway,\nbecause we made friends today!
10	This is a really nice pendant.\nAre you sure it's OK for me to have it?
11	Well, I dunno, but it's probably fine!\nI got it from a nice mercenary lady,\nmyself, after all.
12	I'll be OK with the grass crown and a\ngrass bracelet!
13	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Huh?\nYeah!
tlk502105_ms.json

2	Hey! Has that tree taken your fancy?
3	Yeah, I guess it has!
4	Uraya's a pretty nice looking place,\ndon't you reckon? There's stuff here\nyou can't see anyplace else.
5	If you're feeling a bit messed-up inside,\nlooking at a nice bit of scenery makes\nyou feel a whole lot better.
6	Yes... It's kind of surprising, how\nbeautiful it is...
7	It's not easy, y'know... Fighting as a\nmercenary in the Urayan army, I mean.\nIt's a tough way to earn your keep.
8	It's worse than being a regular soldier.\nIf they need some cannon fodder for a\ndangerous mission, we're it.
9	Yeah...really?
10	Sure, you get a nice pay packet for\neach job. But get injured, and you're\ngonna be hard up for a while.
11	If you take a good bruising, you might\nbe out of the game for months. If that\nhappens, maybe you don't break even.
12	That does sound tough...
13	So sometimes, after a job, I come and\njust have a look at the Urayan\nlandscape. Really heals me.
14	Talking to a nice young woman like\nyou makes all the difference, too.
15	Hey, why don't you have this by way\nof thanks? I got it for my old man,\nbut you have it!
16	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Huh?\nYeah!
17	Nah. Not at all.

5	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]...This could be my chance...
6	Floren... That's a really nice name!
7	You look as if your gentle heart is\nmatched with boundless talent. You\nlook really classy...and cute.
8	Ahaha... Oh...if you say so...
9	I'd be really made up if a Blade like\nyou was serving the Empire.
10	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Oh...stop!
11	Ah, it sounds great, but I already have a\nDriver...and some responsibilities.
12	Not a problem.
13	I'd trade you for ten of the finest\nArdainian soldiers.
14	We'd pay you half a million gold per\nyear, and you'd get living expenses on\ntop of that.
15	We'd give you one of House Horrison's\nancestral treasures as a\ncontract-signing fee, too.
16	Well, I have to agree it's an incredibly\ntempting offer...
17	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Nearly got him...
18	I'm a little perturbed by the lack of\ngreenery in Mor Ardain though.
19	I really need to be around trees and\nplants, you see.
20	Huh? Really?
21	I guess...Mor Ardain's Titan is coming to\nthe end of its life. We don't have the\ntechnology to slow that down, sadly...
22	Huh? Well, why don't you try and come\nup with a plan to fix the problem? Then\nI might reconsider your offer.
23	Understood. Well, I'll let you have\nHouse Horrison's treasure, anyhow.
24	I hope this will help you to remember\nyour promise to reconsider my offer.
25	It's OK! I'm sure it's not the sort of\nthing I'd be able to forget.
26	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Huh?\nYeah!
27	Ah, just forget what I said then.
28	Thinking about it a bit more, I'm not\nsure I've got the authority to make that\nkind of decision.
29	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Huh?\nThat's odd...
30	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Perhaps my charm failed me this time.
31	Hey, wait a moment!\nPlease...just forget what I said earlier.
32	I mean, now I think of it...I can't really\njust go giving away House Horrison's\ntreasure to a Blade like that.
33	Sorry, the deal's off.
34	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Huh?\nThat's odd...
35	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Perhaps my charm failed me this time.
tlk502107_ms.json
1	Oh! What a pretty girl!
2	Hey! You're not so bad yourself!
3	Thanks... Y'know, you're much too\npretty for a Blade.
4	Ahahah... Perhaps...
5	Oh yeah? Hey, I've got some\ndelicious home-made Steamed Milk\nBrioches here.
6	Why don't you take one?
7	Wow! It looks delicious!\nThank you so much!
8	You're welcome! I hope it helps keep\nyour strength up with all your Blade\nduties!

1	Oh... This is excellent wood.
2	You can tell good wood when\nyou see it, young lady?
3	Yes, I can! I have a special affinity with\ntrees and plants.
4	This is Groove Wood, right?
5	Yeah, that's right.\nIt's used to make musical instruments.
6	They're one of Leftheria's famous\nexports.
7	I'm sure it makes them sound lovely...
8	It sure does. Nothing quite like it,\nis there?
9	Why don't you take a few pieces\nwith you, young lady?
10	Really? You're sure it's OK?
11	Yeah. There's more here than you\ncould count in a lifetime. It wouldn't\nhurt if you took a few.
12	Most of the youngsters round here are\nonly interested in salvaging - it's rare to\nsee anyone show an interest in lumber.
13	It really cheers me up to speak to a\ngirl like you.
14	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Huh?\nYeah!
15	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Huh?\nThat's odd...

1	Hey... Do you know who tends this\ngarden?
2	Huh? I'm not too sure.
3	But this place is the Sanctum of the\nIndoline Praetor.
4	I guess it would have the same stately\naura, no matter who tended it.
5	Well, I can really feel that the gardener\nhere truly cherishes this place. I think\nthey must be a good person.
6	Yes...you're probably right.
7	I think so.
8	If I met the person responsible, I'd\ncertainly want to commend them on\ntheir excellent work.
9	Of course! I'd be glad to.
10	May I ask your name?
11	I'm called Floren.
12	Well, Floren... I'd like to give you this.
13	I'm sure that the person who tends this\ngarden would thank you for your kind\nwords and give you a token of thanks.
14	Actually, I'm rather pleased that\nsomeone else appreciates this garden.
15	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Huh?\nYeah!
tlk502110_ms.json
1	Hey! Grassy girl!
2	Who? Me?
3	Yeah, you!
4	I'm actually a Blade of grass, y'know!\nAnd I've got a name! Floren!
5	Sorry.
6	I mean... We don't see a lot of plants\nand stuff in Tantal. There's so much\nsnow. I got a bit carried away.
7	I see. You like trees and plants and\nstuff like that?
8	Would you like to hear about the flora\nthey have in other places?
9	You bet! Yeah! Tell me about it!
10	Well...
11	Wow! I had no idea there was so much\ngreen stuff out there in the world!
12	That was really interesting... You told\nme about things that I've never even\nread about.
13	So I'd like to give you a little thank-you!
14	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Huh?\nYeah!
15	Uhm...Miss, is it OK if I touch your\nclothes? Like, are they made of some\nspecial plants or something?
16	[ML:Feeling kind=Anger ]Hey! Cut it out!
17	Nah... Not so much.

2	Me?
3	It's the first time I've seen your face\naround here...
4	I'm a Blade, y'know?
5	A Blade? I never saw a Blade like you\nbefore...
6	You don't see much of the outside\nworld here in Tantal, do you?
7	Are Ardainian Blades really different\nto Tantalese Blades then?
8	I mean, maybe one sort comes into\nfashion, one goes out of fashion, in\ndifferent places?
9	Hmmm... How can I explain it.
10	It's not like I thought, "I'll be this or\nthat sort of Blade". I just left it to\nnature, I turned out like I did.
11	Oh. That's deep.
12	Hey, it was really nice talking to you\ntoday.
13	Well, it was nice talking to you too,\nma'am.
14	Why, thank you. Here, why don't you\nhave this?
15	I had some time to kill, so I made these\nfor my grandkids. I got too much time\non my hands, so I made too many.
16	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Huh?\nYeah!

45	Who know, maybe Mochichi give friend\nshiny new rank! For small fee!
46	Finally, this is reward for rank increase!

61	Great-Grannypon was true master of\nsalvage. Always bring back white shiny\ntreasure trove on every attempt.
62	Great-Grannypon not around any more\nthough, so sometimes get called\nLegendary Salvager.

68	Praise be to Rex! Praise be to Rex!
69	Anyway, Rank A very great to\nachieve, but also sadly dead end.\nNo more ranks left to earn!
70	Please take final rank increase reward!
71	Mochichi very grateful to Rex for\nletting Mochichi rate salvager rank.\nWas actually quite great honor.
72	Thank you much, friends!
73	Pay 200G?

76	Pay 2000G?
77	Pay

62	Who'd have thought such a massive\nship would sink? I wonder when it\nwas built...

64	Ooh, must be some really top-notch\ngoodies in there! Salvager-sense\ntingling like mad!
65	You first. That's the salvager way.\nCharging headlong into the unknown!
66	Nah, I'll pass. You're the one who's\nalways going on about your amazing\nswordsmanship. You go first!
67	Probably better to let the Drivers and\nBlades go in first... I bet it's chock-full\nof dangerous monsters.
68	Yeah... Better leave rough stuff like that\nto the pros, eh?

12	That fish looks delish!
13	It's a whopper of a catch!
14	How much for this, please?
15	So the windmill grinds the flour?
16	That's right!
17	Where do kids get the energy...?
18	I like this playground a lot.
19	This last order was pretty hefty.
20	Actually, I like to stay busy.
21	That's so cold!\nI'll get you for that one!
22	Ahhh! So cold!
23	I wonder what's past the horizon...
24	I hear there are some hot places,\nand some cold places, too.
25	Is this spot good for fishing?\nLet's find out!
26	I think you'd have better luck fishing\nin Coolley Lake outside Torigoth.
27	Wanna go to the harbor?
28	I'd love to go ogle some new makeup.
29	That Dward sure likes fishing, huh?
30	That place look like good\nfor salvaging.
31	It look awfully deep...\nFriend go yourself.
32	Ah!\nI saw a fish!
33	If I bring it home, d'you think\nmy ma will like it?

36	Toodley-doo～♪
37	Dam-de-ram～♪\nPam-pam～♪
38	Great, now it stuck in my head too...
39	Squee!
40	Ooh!\nSo enchanting!
41	There was some disturbance at the\nbase lately.
42	No clue what it's about.
43	What, what?!\nGo away, meh!
44	There's some brouhaha going on\nat that pier over there.
45	Might go check it out later.
46	Is this the last of the luggage?
47	Yeah, this should be all of it.
48	Are you taking this boat?
49	That's right.
50	Watch out!
51	It's fiiine.\nFine, fine, fine.

53	I should get my family a souvenir.\nBut what...?
54	Hey, pass me that drink, would you?
55	Roger that.
56	Thanks for sharing the other day!
57	Don't mention it.
58	Let's try sneaking into the base again!
59	I don't wanna... We got an earful the\nlast time they found us...
60	That Gormotti kid's always there.
61	Is she trying to make friends, or what?
62	There's so many flowers\nI've never seen before!
63	You don't know how to climb trees?\nLemme teach you!
64	I don't know if I can...
65	Let's go look at Armus!
66	The big ones are scary!\nAnd there's a lot of big ones...
67	What's this building here?
68	It's the Consulate.\nIt's where some big-wigs work.
69	Ah, that's a nice view...
70	Shall we go shopping later?
71	Not a bad idea.\nSo long as there's drinking!
72	What an enormous windmill.
73	Yeah, it's a good view from here.
74	Are you gonna be a soldier\nwhen you grow up?
75	I'd rather just carry stuff.
76	That doesn't belong\nin this tranquil scene.
77	I guess so, but...\nwhat're you gonna do?
78	I think I might get some\nmeat at the base today.
79	Ahoy there!\nNeed a hand?
80	Ugh, gotta go home and start cooking...
81	C'mon, let's play together!
82	After we take this little guy\nback to the farm.
83	One! Two! Three! Four!
84	Outdated equipment? Again?
85	Quit your whining.\nIt's the butt-end of the Empire,\nwhat do you expect?
86	Is this all the goods for transport?
87	Some more bits and\nbobs are still coming.
88	It's another cheerful day\nhere in the woods.
89	Huh, I wonder.\nD'you think Gormott's Titan is happy?\n'Cos I think so.
90	Yeah, come to think of it,\nall this is part of the Titan...
91	Me come to buy lumber!\nAnd sell daily use goods in return!
92	Wood's gotten awfully cheap recently.
93	If we take quality wood from Gormott\nand use to reinforce Goldmouth...\nOh, be still my beaty-beaty heart!
94	Ughhh...
95	...Bleurgh, I knew I shouldn't have\ndrunk so much last night...
96	You write home often?
97	Actually, I haven't lately...\nMaybe I ought to.
98	They're researching ways to make\nArchelon even more powerful back\nin the fatherland!
99	Let's hope that pans out.
100	I'll not lose to a soldier!
101	Looking good, though I'll remind you\nwe're meant to be on break...
102	There's no way I can work\nall the way up there...
103	Huh? How did you keep it together on\nthe Titan Battleship on the way here?
104	Stop! Don't hurt!\nMe just come to deliver parcel!
105	Every time same mistake! Why! Why??!!
106	Time for a breather...
107	Hey, I want to ride number eight.\nMove those plates, would you?
108	What're you on about?\nAsshole.
109	Uhh...\nNo, sorry, can't hear a thing.
110	Not so many casualties lately...
111	Man, I'm a sucker for that look of\ndisdain Lady Mòrag's got going on.
112	...Hey, are you all right?
113	Please grab those vegetables for me.
114	I'm staring at the sky,\nlooking at passing birds.
115	That windmill never ceases\nto amaze me.
116	Um, about our next shipping route...
117	As a general rule, here's what you do...
118	We must be able to adapt\nto any and all circumstances.
119	A farm, next-door to the base?\nJust wow.
120	Peace has made these people soft.
121	Whaddya think of this scenery?\nPretty great, huh?
122	There's a lot of 'em...
123	It's food, isn't it?
124	I don't know what to do now...
125	Why do we have to leave?!
126	I'm sorry...\nI've got orders to not let you pass.
127	Please hurry it up.
128	Brrrrrrrr...
129	Let us out, meh...
130	The info broker's got a rumor about a\nTitan that's been launched! Curious!
common_ms/autotalk_ma07.json
1	Is that all the cargo?
2	Umm...
3	I like Titan battleships as much as the\nnext guy, but I don't want a war...
4	I couldn't agree more.
5	Price is too high!\nPlease lower price!
6	No more rations for today!

29	Wahey!\nWhat a huge ship!
30	Another year, another chance to see\nthe lilies in bloom...
31	Nothing to report!
32	Pappy, which one's your boat?

68	Food!\nAwesome!
69	Ma'am, you're in the way.
70	Sorry, it's just my legs acting up...
71	Just knock it off, would you?
72	Get off my case already!
73	Herbs! Me got herbs!\nHerbs selling like hot buns!!
74	I'll bet they're not selling\nlike hot buns...
75	Hyahh!\nHuaah!

21	Dadapooon!\nMamapoooon!

25	Where the littlepons gone off to?
26	Just focus on the job, all right?
27	We gotta fix this up before nightfall.
28	Wouldn't want anyone falling\nand having an accident.
29	My friend's gone to Gormott.\nI wonder if they're doing fine...
30	Mama, can I buy a sweetie?
31	Oh, all right then.\nBut just the one!
32	I feel sorry for the soldiers...

36	Air here taste more spicier\nthan me thought!
37	Where did I put it...? Hmm...
38	You'd better find that key.\nI'm not sleeping outside!
39	This open-air hot spring is the best in\nthe empire.
40	I could happily come here every day!
41	That big Titan weapon's\ngone now, huh.
42	Maybe it went back to the palace?
43	Quick, quick!\nSomebody maybe come!

92	Still working at this hour?
93	Hey, quality work takes time.
94	How are you doing over there?
95	Nearly done!
96	Just what you'd expect\nfrom a military facility.
97	Let's head back before\npeople show up.
98	What the heck is this graffiti...?\nSome kind of new code?
99	Wanna go shopping together?
100	I guess so...
101	Ooh, aren't you a strapping fellow!
102	Why don't you come have\na bite to eat at my place?
103	Hey, I'm sorry.\nI tried my best, but...
104	The older kids get to play\nout in the open. Not fair!
105	Hey, that's dangerous!\nCome back at once!
106	Look, Dad! There's some sort\nof entrance down below!
107	I've been seeing lots of Drivers\naround the palace recently.
108	I've heard they've been\nrecruiting far and wide.

120	Ugh, I give up...
121	One! Two! Three!
122	Whoever fails this exercise gets\na one-way ticket to Gormott!
123	How many ships was it today...?
124	I hear they're developing a new model.
125	Does it look fixable?
126	This part keeps breaking, doesn't it...
127	Now I hear we've got\ninternal enemies, too?
128	No rest for the wicked, say I.
129	You better be ready for battle.\nMake sure you know how to use this.
130	I will.
131	Let's play ball!
132	Yeah!\nAnd after that, we can play soldiers!
133	What do I do...? I think I dropped that\nkey somewhere around here...
134	Losing the key to the harbor gates...\nMy CO is gonna be so pissed!
135	I can't find it anywhere... Don't tell me\nit's fallen right off the bridge...!
136	Fadhail's never gonna let me hear\nthe end of this... I'll just have to\nkeep searching tomorrow.
137	That's a big vehicle!
138	The Titan battleships that came to\nGormott were bigger still, y'know...
139	Me bring cargo to town on double!
140	This crate too heavy, meh...
141	Nice load of cargo you've got there.
142	Everything is above board!\nMe check twice myself!!
143	Much brighter than torches, isn't it?
144	The city's brighter still, you'll see.
145	Why it so dusty?!
146	Dust get in mouth!\nPftheh! Pthooie!
147	Please use the far lift\nfor transporting Armus.
148	Why, is this one off-limits?
149	Pay attention when you're\noperating this thing.
150	Are you sure you've\nstacked everything?
151	Mind you don't offend anyone.
152	It's not my first guard shift you know...
153	Doing maintenance on this geothermal\nplant is pretty dangerous work.
154	I've asked them loads of times, but the\narmy can't fix the monster problem...
155	We use the gondola to get around here.\nThere's a lot of monsters on dry land...
156	So...hot... It's like Mor Ardain's Titan\nis running a fever!
157	If you fall in there, you'll... Let's just\nsay you don't want to fall in there.
158	I'm actually afraid of heights? I don't\nknow why they put me up here...
159	Let's just keep each other secure, OK?
160	The industrial lift's on the left.\nLift for people's a bit further in.
161	Can we hurry and go\nto Alba Cavanich now?
162	Let's we go!
163	Huh... Got in through\nthat little gap, huh?
164	Don't fall out of the elevator.
165	I wanna go hoooome!
166	...There are procedures for\nthat sort of thing.
167	Where's everyone gone...?
168	Aren't you hungry?
169	...I'll be fine... Ugh...
common_ms/autotalk_ma10.json
1	Plenty of 'em...
2	Seems to be in order.
3	Whatever happens to Mor Ardain,\nwe still have to do our duty.
4	I hope my folks back in\nMor Ardain are OK.
5	It's exactly at times like this where\neveryone needs to shape up and\ndo their bit.
6	Ah... What will become\nof Alrest in the end?
7	Can't let Torna get any benefit\nout of this again...
8	These Judician Titan weapons sure had\nsome awesome powers...
9	Looking good! I don't think the Urayans\nwill know what's hit 'em!
10	I hope we can get some decent use out\nof this Judician technology.
11	Perhaps we'll be able to help\nsome of our people with this\nTitan weapon.
12	Can the Titan...the world even...survive?
13	Listening to this stuff makes me tired...
common_ms/autotalk_ma11.json
1	Let's get a souvenir for Mom!
2	If you're tired, feel free to rest.
3	I might pay a visit to\nQuattor Street later.

5	Welcome to Indol!
6	This one or that one? Or this one...\nOr that?
7	First things first.\nI'll go to the Sanctum to give thanks.
8	The Sanctum's not too far now.
9	Hey there!
10	I'll try to remember that.
11	The choral music is truly sublime here.
12	Hoooooo... ♪
13	Haaaaaa... ♪
14	Heeeeeee... ♪

16	You can really get lost in these songs...
17	Hello. Me would like friend to\nteach how me pray, please?
18	Listen children! Understanding this\nsystem of notation is required for\nemployment in Indol. Apply yourselves!
19	Let me check about tomorrow.
20	Nights are so quiet in Indol.\nIt's really quite pleasant.
21	I think Grampaw went to drink\nsome Odifa again.
22	On consideration, I have to say\nI'm opposed to Blades as such.
23	How long will this go on...?
24	I wonder how my friends in\nGormott are coping...
25	Every day the same old thing...
26	Ah...\nIt never gets any easier, does it?
27	Big building is big, meh...
28	I'm keeping a close eye on\nthe refugees from here.
29	Friend must be tired.
30	Night is the time when\nI get my prep work done.
31	Anyone know what today's rations are?
32	No more Blades!
33	Down with Blades!
34	Ugh, I'm so hungry!\nIsn't there any more to eat?!
35	Stop acting up, OK?
36	Yes. Sorry...
37	Whoop-whoop!
38	What're we gonna play today?
39	Why's the Titan boat not here yet?
40	Taking in refugees sure is a handful...\nI mean, it's a great thing and all, but...
41	Me will study hard\nto master technology of Indol!
42	Any chance the rations could be\nincreased?
43	I never thought we'd end up in Indol...
44	It might taste better if you let\nthe spice come out more.
45	Mmm!\nNice and mellow!
46	No food or drink is allowed in the\nSanctum. Be sure to finish it out here.
47	Wish I could decide what to get...
48	That refugee was here\nagain today...
49	When can we go back to Gormott?
50	Line up properly, you louts!
51	What I wouldn't give for a cold beer...
52	I gotta stay vigilant! Stay vigilant...
53	All right, form an orderly line!
54	When I'm all grown up,\nI'll be the best soldier ever!

1	I'd better clean this area up.\nSoon... Well, soonish...
2	Believe it or not, this place used to be\na bustling marketplace, before.
3	It's rare to get customers from abroad...\nOh, the bar area is still being prepared.
4	Welcome, welcome!\nThe bar area's open for business.
5	I saw a Luckroach over there!
6	Oho, that's the bug that brings\nhappiness! Something nice will happen!
7	Lazing under a tree with a good book...\nAhh, it doesn't get any better than this.
8	I hope one day I'll get to go outside!
9	Ahh...\nThat's pricey...
10	But play outside is more fun!
11	No way!\nReading books is more fun!
12	This is Tantal's prestigious\nLibrary Philosofia...
13	...and that's the story.\nThat's Tantal's past in a nutshell.
14	I never knew!
15	Wow!\nThat's cool!
16	Hey, tell us another!
17	Muuuummyyy!\nI'm huuuungryyyy!\nCan we have fiiiish?
18	OK, look, just drop the price another\n100G and you'll have yourself a deal.
19	OK, please? C'mon...
20	Is that book any good?
21	*sigh*\nI can't afford any of this makeup...
22	Heheheh, hey!\nLet's scribble something on this wall!
23	Friend be sure to sign name, too!
24	Hey, check it out. I'm gonna\nsnowball that spaced-out dude...
25	It's cold outside. Please, do come in.
26	Grr, nobody's gonna attack us in here!\nBut no, I still have to patrol every day...
27	Stow it, buster! You're on duty.
28	I should get a Nopon's honest opinion\nabout my business plan.
29	There's a time to be sober, and a time \nto drink! Well, bottoms up!
30	Damn, I'm short again...
31	Snowball fighting!
32	I've got stuff you wouldn't find\nin just any old daytime stall!
33	To be fair, that stall is a bit cheaper\nthan the daytime ones...
34	Still plenty expensive, though.
35	I heard there's a certain Blade sealed \naway somewhere in Theosoir...
36	I pulled another all-nighter...\nAnd now I feel horrid...
37	Oh, I'm starving!
38	Ah...
39	I wish life wasn't so bare-bones...
40	Anyone who makes a ruckus gets\ndragged over to the palace. Life, eh?
41	We discuss official business all night\nlong... I wouldn't trade it for anything.
42	You better check it properly, or else!
common_ms/autotalk_ma15.json
1	Good. Let's get this to the granary.
2	And I'll take that to the fields.
3	I'll lend you a hand.
4	Heeey, wait up!
5	We'll be late if we don't hurry!
6	I'll find awesome treasure,\nand then you'll see!
7	I'll go next!
8	Then me, then me!
9	What's Argentum like, then?
10	It busy-busy, hustle-hustle,\nnight and day.
11	Ohhh, the kid's done it again!\nMore broken plates...
12	Mgh...\nI don't wanna get in trouble...
13	Just say sorry, please.
14	What about this tree here?
15	Not bad.\nShould get some decent sap.
16	Come on, Sandflies!\nCome on out!
17	Come on, come on!
18	So cute, the way it's twinkling...
19	It's hypnotic...
20	I suppose we could build\na new storehouse...
21	Hmmmm...
22	If any of those Camill approach,\nwe need to let everyone know!
23	Understood!
24	Understood!
25	Here, let's share some of this...
26	That's so sweet. Thanks!
27	I wonder if we'll see\nany shooting stars...
28	There!\nI saw one!
common_ms/autotalk_ma40.json
1	Even monsters get tired of\nchasing you eventually...
2	Make sure to put away your weapon\nif you're gonna run away!
3	I've heard that defeated monsters\ndrop money and items!
4	Don't they also drop HP Potions when\nyou Topple them and stuff?
5	Did you know Driver Arts can\nhave extra effects sometimes?
6	First you gotta Break the enemy!\nThen you can Topple 'em!
7	I see, I see...\nAnd what does that do?
8	Toppled foes are easy targets.\nYou won't miss a single attack!
9	Driver Combos won't always work\nagainst some enemies... And some other\nones are completely immune!
10	Wow... They must be pretty\ntough cookies.
11	'Course, we don't have to worry about\nthat since we're not Drivers!
12	If you approach a monster from behind,\nit won't even notice you're there!
13	Um, they're not ALL that oblivious.\nI should know - I tried to sneak up\non a wily one the other day!
14	And it actually spotted you? Huh...\nI guess you can never be too careful.
15	Some enemies will only block\nattacks from certain directions,\nlike the front or the side.
16	I heard there are some monsters\nthat'll power up their allies!
17	Sounds like a pain. Probably best\nto take those ones out first!
18	Traveling to Auresco is big pain\nin bum-bum. If only could take\nbreak at Peln on way!
19	Traveling to Auresco much easier\nthese days! Can rest up at Peln\nbefore last leg of journey!
20	Me heard it was Lora that chased off\nnasty Gogols at Peln! Many thanks!
21	It's such a pain trying to work when\nthe lantern’s broken...
22	Yeah, I wish someone would\nfix that thing up already.
23	The lantern's back in working order!\nAh, it's so much easier to work\nwith a little illumination.
24	Yeah, I heard some guy called\nChalcedony organized the repairs.\nWe owe that dude big time!
25	Did you hear? Apparently it was\na Knight of Torna, Lady Lora herself,\nwho fixed up the lanterns!
26	Yeah, it sounds like she's been\nbusy all over the place...
27	Meh-meh... Cloth merchant Obibi\nseem down in the dumps lately...
28	Probably because she not popular\nwith Nopon customers. Must be\nbig struggle to make money!
29	This hat so stylish!\nNo wonder it all the rage!
30	Obibi seem much happier lately too!
31	Me heard stylish hat was actually idea\nof recently knighted Lora lady.
32	Wowee! Knight and fashion guru...\nSo multi-talented!
33	That handyman Gio is pretty incredible.\nHe'll take on any task at no charge!
34	Really? Wow. Maybe I'll hit him up\nnext time I need a helping hand.
35	That handyman, Gio, he's great and all,\nbut he's kind of old hat. It's all about\nLady Lora nowadays.
36	And how! She and Lord Addam are\nalways ready to offer a helping hand\nto anyone in need!
37	It can't be easy to help out so many\npeople. I could never do it myself!
38	So Brogyn and his crew brought\nall this food from the capital, eh?
39	That's right - apparently Master Addam\norganized the whole thing!
40	Well I never! That man really is\nthe kindest in all the realm.
41	The city of Auresco is always\nsuch a peaceful place.
42	I would hate to have to leave\nthis fine city behind...
43	True enough. I only hope we can find\nsafe shelter within the city bounds...
44	I hear a shelter has been built\nbeneath Spefan Inn! Now we should\nall be safe.
45	And it's all thanks to Lady Lora!\nWe owe her so much.
46	You'd best get those materials\ndelivered posthaste, or you'll be\nin for an earful from Wayton!
47	Aren't you going to evacuate\nalong with everyone else?
48	Evacuate? Me? Hah!\nI don't care if every other coward\nabandons this place, I'm not budging!
49	I hear young Aquin built a fine Titan\nvessel! Now we can easily evacuate\nwhen things get rough!
50	Uh, weren't you saying you wouldn't\nbudge even if everyone else left?
51	Well, yes...but Lady Lora and Lord\nAddam personally supported this effort.\nWho am I to turn down their goodwill?
52	...Well, I'm glad you came around.
53	Why can't we play in the gardens\nany more? This is no fun...
54	Oh! Lady Lora!\nThank you for fixing up the gardens!
55	The view from here is immaculate,\ndon't you think?
56	Sure, but, uh...should you even be here?\nDon't you have work to do?
57	I'll have you know, inspecting the view\nis a very important part of my job!
58	It's so wonderful to be able to look out\nupon this view once again.
59	Indeed - and all thanks to the hard\nwork of Bry and Kaym.
60	This place is like paradise...
61	That's all down to Bry the gardener.\nHe's a talented one, all right!
62	This used to be such a\nbeautiful garden...
63	That Aegis has a lot to answer for.
64	It's so good to see Sachsum Gardens\nlooking beautiful again.
65	Well, with Lady Lora and Lord Addam\non the job, it was only a matter of time!
66	...Why do YOU look so proud of\nTHEIR good work?
67	Remember, stay out of the alleyways.\nYou can run into some real shady\nNopon back there.
68	I know! My mum's always telling\nme to watch out for them.
69	Those Nopon in the back alleys are\nhardcore criminals. They throw litter\non the streets and stuff!
70	Yeah, my mum told me all about it...\nI'd be so scared if I ever ran into them!
71	Hey, I heard nobody's seen those\ndodgy Nopon in the alleyways lately.
72	Awesome! We can finally go play\nhide and seek back there!
73	W-wow, playing in the back alleys?\nThat sounds so...rebellious!
74	I love Tornan Trout.\nIt's tasty AND cheap!
75	That's 'cause they breed them so\nefficiently. I prefer the taste of\nAmber Sweetfish myself, though.
76	I heard the farm's whole shoal\nof Tornan Trout was wiped out\nin the attack...
77	Oh, how awful... D'you think that\nmeans we'll be seeing price hikes?
78	Thanks to Lady Lora and Lord Addam,\nthe fish farm is up and running again!
79	Well, that's a relief! I thought Tyler's\nwhole business was going to go under.
80	Terribly sorry, but we're all out\nof Armus right now.
81	Dear me, that's quite the pickle...
82	The Armus came back! Young Joey\nsorted everything out, the fine lad!
83	Well, that's good to hear.\nI'd never be able to deliver my\nluggage without them!
84	Where's Formide Shopping Ward\nagain? I need to buy some accessories...
85	Right behind you, you numpty!\nHonestly, I swear you could get lost\nin your own living room...
86	D'you think we should get out of the\ncapital? I mean, what if the Aegis\ncomes back for more...?
87	Don't worry, I'm sure Lord Addam\ncan handle that nasty Aegis.
88	Apparently we're all going to\nbe able to evacuate on that\nTitan ship Aquin built!
89	Well, isn't that nice for you!\nNot that I'm going anywhere.
90	What?! Please, you have to come too!
91	Me want to be more fashionable!
92	Meh, no use standing round\nand complain. Best go down\nto Formide Shopping Ward.
93	This hat is pinnacle of fashion!
94	Shop of Obibi seem very popular lately!
95	Today's the day we settle this, bro.\nOnce and for all!
96	We'll see!
97	You can do it, big bro!\nDon't give up, other big bro!
98	Those brothers are always going at it,\nday in, day out... Don't they ever get\nbored of this nonsense?
99	When the town was under attack,\nyou turned tail and ran away!\nYou're such an embarrassment!
100	Grrr...\nI... I know...
101	Hey, I thought I saw you running too!
102	Only Prince Addam's lot had the guts\nto stand and fight!
103	C'mon, can we please stop bickering?\nWe should be joining forces,\nlike brothers are meant to do!
104	Guess you've got a point...\nYeah, OK! Let's join forces,\nand kick that Aegis's butt!
105	You guys...don't you think that's\nkind of dangerous?!
106	Nah, we'll be fine! Besides, this is the\nperfect spot for keeping lookout!
107	Lady Lora! You chased off those Gogols\nat the main gate, didn't you?
108	I was only watching from a distance,\nbut you looked so...gallant!
109	I know, right?! Man, I'd love to become\na Driver too someday!
110	Lady Lora! You're going to defeat that\nnasty Aegis for us, right?!
111	I hope you know we're all\ncheering you on!
112	A Gormotti and an Urayan? That's an\nunusual pairing if ever I saw one.
113	Ah, the sweet sound of\nTorigonda music...
114	It's a great performance to be sure!
115	They're just the coolest!
116	I'm so glad these guys were around\nwhen the Aegis attacked.
117	The resounding tones of the\nTornan Viella gave us courage\nwhen all seemed lost!
118	Don't you think Leo's been playing\nhis Tornan Viella with a renewed\nvigour lately?
119	I heard he had a spot of good fortune.
120	With the addition of Rikoko's flute,\nthese performances have become\nmore remarkable than ever.
121	Yes, that young Nopon really brings\na certain...gleeful energy to the mix!
122	Lady Loraaaa!
123	Sorry about her, Lady Lora.\nShe really looks up to you, you know.
124	Lady Lora! After you defeat the Aegis,\nI hope you'll regale us with tales of\nyour gallant efforts!
125	My lieges... Though I am but an old\nman, I humbly beg of you to protect\nour future, for this child's sake.
126	Oh! It's Lady Lora!
127	I see Lord Addam and Lord Hugo, too!
128	Me go play with friends!
129	Are things really going to be OK?\nDo you think we'll really survive...?
130	I...it'll be fine!
131	Yes-yes! Friends beat up nasty\npeople like bish-bash-bosh!
132	Roll up, roll up!\nGet your steaming-hot buns here!
133	Ah, Lord Addam!\nWould you care for a taste?
134	Lady Lora! Would you and your friends\ncare for a bite to eat?
135	Lord Jin, you simply must share one of\nyour famous recipes with me!
136	Oh, whichever should I buy?\nChoosing accessories is so hard...
137	How about a Promise Ring?
138	If only I had stronger accessories,\nI could've beaten up that Aegis's\nminions no problem...
139	Um, I don't think accessories make\nTHAT much difference. You'd need\nstronger weapons and Blades too.
140	I must equip the very best accessories\nto keep myself well-protected...
141	Are you sure you want to buy them\nhere, then? It might be better to defeat\nenemies and get them that way...
142	Aww, they haven't got any\nPlatinum Shrooms...
143	Those things aren't easy to get hold of.\nWith their divine scent and incredible\ntexture, it's no wonder they're a rarity.
144	If you're ever in a bind, you're more\nlikely to find good help from Gio or\nLora than from the army.
145	They're lifesavers, for sure. But we\ncan't just rely on them for everything!
146	True enough. Sometimes you've gotta\nsort out your own problems!
147	Hey...what do you think's going to\nhappen to Torna now?
148	It's difficult to say...\nBut I think we should trust in Lord\nAddam. He'll find a way, I know it.
149	This inn's so lovely, isn't it?
150	Yes, the atmosphere here is so different\nfrom back home. Very relaxing.
151	D'you reckon we ought to think\nabout heading back home?
152	I doubt we could do that even if\nwe wanted to. All the Titan ships\nare fully booked lately.
153	Wow, that's pretty awkward...
154	Well, we never did manage to\ncatch a ship back home.\nBut maybe that's for the best.
155	Yeah, I have grown pretty fond of\nthis place. And I'm sure that wonderful\nprince will sort everything out!
156	You need to focus more!
157	At this rate, the Aegis's Artifices will\nmake short work of you!
158	We're going to protect Torna's future\nwith our own hands!
159	Let's go eat some of Café Amicus's\nfamous specialty!
160	Really? I'm not that hungry yet...
161	We should probably head home soon.
162	I don't want to be in a confined space!\nIt makes me scared those things will\ncome back and I'll be trapped inside!
163	Now, once Lord Addam and the others\nstart fighting, you run to the inn and\nhide on the lower level, OK?
164	D'you think it'll hold up?\nI'm a bit scared...
165	Haven't you been reading long enough?\nLet's do something else already!
166	Sure, once I get to the end of the\nTale of Blue Barney...
167	C'mon, cheer up. I know all that\nruckus was scary, but we can't let\nit break our spirits!
168	I'm researching the legend of Elysium.\nIt might hold some hints as to why\nthis place was attacked...
169	Let's head to Formide Shopping Ward!\nI heard the chairman of the Chamber of\nCommerce is giving out free food!
170	Let me finish jotting down all my\nobservations about Lady Lora first...
171	Is this the full shipment for today?
172	The damage wasn't too bad around\nthese parts. We were pretty lucky...
173	Gotta make sure we have plenty of\nsupplies to distribute, just in case\nworst comes to worst...
174	Looks like Median Gate is still closed...
175	Guess we'll have to go round through\nFormide Shopping Ward if we want to\nreach the palace...
176	Have you considered joining the army?\nIt's a great honor to fight for Torna!
177	Why are you being so pushy?\nThe capital is at peace, do we\nreally need a big army?
178	Have you considered joining the army?\nJoin us and take revenge on the\nbrigands who attacked our fine capital!
179	I think I'll pass. I'm no Driver, I'd just\nwind up dying a fool's death.
180	Have you considered joining the-
181	Sure, I'll lend you my strength.\nI want to pitch in to do something\nfor my homeland.
182	The world's a dangerous place lately...\nI heard a pack of Gogols almost\nmade it into the city gates!
183	Oh yeah, but Lady Lora drove them off,\nright? She's pretty amazing...
184	I heard Tarres the master glassmaker\npassed away...
185	That's awful... I don't think he ever\npassed his skills on, so they might be\nlost to the world forever...
186	Hey, did you see the glasswork\nyoung Charlet made?
187	Indeed. She may not be up to Tarres's\nlevel yet, but she's full of potential!
188	Hey, did you see Sarah's\nnew boyfriend?
189	Oh, yeah! Isn't he just the coolest?!
190	...Seriously?
191	I haven't seen Mireille around lately.\nDo you know what she's been up to?
192	Apparently she got back together with\nher ex-husband. They're starting up a\npottery business in Hyber Village.
193	Ahh, it was so good to be able to eat\nTricolor Acqua Pazza again...
194	All thanks to Lord Addam and\nthat passionate Ardainian.
195	Me hear Lord Addam organize cooking\ncontest. Was very successful!
196	Me suggest to Chairman we organize\neven bigger event in Formide Shopping\nWard. Sound like big profit opportunity!
197	Ah, you'll want to ask Jerry about that.\nYou can find him down below.
198	J-Jerry? Are you sure? I guess he\nhas mellowed out a bit lately...
199	Palva and Dudan were looking awfully\npleased with themselves... You don't\nthink they really found a stash of gold?
200	Oh, those two are always like that.\nI'm sure their mad scheme was a dud,\njust like usual.
201	That Palva seems to be doing awfully\nwell for herself lately...
202	Rumor has it she dug up a legendary\nstash of gold in the Dannagh Desert.\nI guess dreams really can come true...
203	That's the palace - Aureus Palace!
204	Wow, it's so...tall!\nHow many floors d'you think it's got?
205	So tell me...did the Chamber of\nCommerce Chairman turn out to be\na rotter?
206	No, he was just working himself\ntoo hard. Looks like he's going to\ntone it down a little from now on.
207	I heard a Titan visited the Shopping\nWard the other day and bought a\nveritable mountain of meat and fish!
208	I guess with a body that big, you'd\nneed to have a big appetite...
209	Life's been tough for all of us lately,\nbut I'm glad things worked out for\nHedwyn at least.
210	I quite agree. Seeing Kali and Kelly so\nhappy has brought joy to us all!
211	I feel so...useless right now.\nWhen this place was attacked by\nmonsters, we couldn't do a thing.
212	If we want to contribute, we'll just\nhave to become incredible Drivers\nlike Lord Addam and Lord Hugo!
213	So we made it to Aletta, but we're\nkind of short on manpower.
214	Still, Lord Addam's retainers are doing\neverything they can to help. We'll just\nhave to work with what we've got.
215	Six whole new recruits! Thanks to\nLord Addam and the Lieutenant, our\nmanpower woes are as good as solved!
216	Though those four young Nopon are\nmore like a quarter of a recruit each.
217	We could learn a lot from the way Lady\nLora fights. Passing weapons between\nDriver and Blade...most intriguing!
218	This is Lord Addam's domain,\nso it's far safer here than in Uraya.
219	Yeah... We can finally get some\nproper rest, right, Mama?
220	I want you to grow up nice and\nstrong like Lady Lora, Lady Haze\nand Lady Brighid.
221	What about Lady Mythra?\nCan't I be like her instead?
222	Ah, Lord Addam and company!\nGood luck out there!
223	We're counting on you to bring\npeace to Alrest!
224	Should we not be accompanying\nLord Hugo as well?
225	We're in Torna now - they don't want\ntoo many Ardainian soldiers roaming\nabout. Let's just stick to our stations.
226	I haven't seen the Special Inquisitor\naround lately...what's he up to?
227	Accompanying Lord Hugo, perhaps?\nPersonally, I'd feel safer with him back\nin Mor Ardain. He's nothing but trouble.
228	Word of Lord Hugo's brilliant feats\nhas reached far and wide!
229	I feel such pride. I only wish he would\nallow us to accompany him!
230	Did we evacuate the weapon and\naccessory vendors yet?
231	Yeah. They're both below the inn,\nsafe and sound.
232	The bridge was finally fixed...
233	Best not to hang about here.\nLet's make haste for the capital.
234	We're so lucky we got out of the capital\nwhen we did! To think it got attacked...
235	I know exactly what you mean...\nWe need to get back to Aletta.
236	Should... Should we leave Torna?\nIs it so bad that we need to\nabandon Aletta?
237	I don't have all the answers myself...\nBut I trust Lord Addam! I'm certain\nhe'll make everything OK!
common_ms/autotalk_ma41.json
1	If you have two Blades, be sure to\nswitch between them regularly.\nIt'll broaden your options in battle!
2	Have you ever seen a unique monster?\nApparently each one has a fearsome\nnickname of its very own.
3	I did spot one once, but I wasn't fool\nenough to go near it. I've heard way too\nmany horror stories about those beasts!
4	See anything untoward?
5	The monsters always stay clear of the\ncamp, so we should be safe.
6	Remember, we're here in pursuit of the\nAegis. Be ready for combat at all times.
7	Aye-aye, sir!
8	Our orders are to stand by in Gormott\nfor the time being. We could be called\non at any time, so stay prepared.
9	Sir, yes, sir!
10	We must be ready to set sail at\na moment's notice.
11	Another lead that amounted to nothing!\nHow are we supposed to track down\nthe Aegis at this rate?!
12	Dispatching this Titan warship isn't a\nmeasure to be taken lightly. We'll just\nhave to await word from the homeland.
13	Surely we should set sail for Torna\nat once. They require our aid!
14	I'm afraid not. If we enter Tornan\nterritory without official orders, we risk\nbeing mistaken for an invading force.
15	So the time has finally come to set sail\nfor Torna! Let's show them what the\nArdainian military is capable of!
16	There are still preparations to be\nmade before we can depart.\nI beg you, please calm yourself...

1	Dear friends! Morumo reaffirm dream\nto make Formide Shopping Ward\nbiggest trade center in Alrest, beating\nPyrithium Trade Guild in process!
2	Thanks to friends, shop of Obibi\nis very successful! If friends ever\nhave need for textiles or hats,\nplease to stop by!
3	Dekudeku's Walky-Walky pilgrimage\nis go very well! Dekudeku want to learn\nall about business and take learnings\nback to Voltis Trade Guild.
4	The shelter we built in the basement\nof my inn should stand up to a pretty\nstrong assault. You don't need to worry\nabout this town. We'll protect it.
5	Thanks for cheering Joey up! What I\nreally want is to be able to get along\nwith everyone. I'm gonna try hard, like\nLora does, to make that happen!
6	Nice one getting those Armus home\nsafely. I promise not to try any more\nstrange experiments! I do wish Teeco\nwould stop meddling, though...
7	It's great that I'm all better now, but\nthe best thing is that my mum isn't\nsad anymore. Thanks for making her\nsmile again.

72	I vow to one day become the kind of\nsoldier that others can look up to. My\nmemory will stand as monument to\nmy efforts! Just you wait and see!
73	That meal was so delicious, I feel like\nI could repair an entire fleet now!\nIf you're ever in Mor Ardain, you must\nlet me treat you to some home cooking!
74	Truly, I am humbled by your kindness.\nI shall strive henceforth to maintain\npositive relations between Gormott\nand Mor Ardain, I swear it...
75	Isn't Lyta awesome? She's kind of\nbecome my role model. I think I'll\nswing by Torna on my way to Uraya\nand pay her a visit!
76	Hey, you actually got a knighthood!\nGo you! Don't let it go to your head,\nthough. Let's stay true to each other,\nand reach for the stars!
77	I hope Kelly and Kali are happy now\nthat they're back with their father.\nI'll have to take a leaf out of your book\nand start being more charitable, too...
78	So you're a Knight of Torna now...\nBut our friendship is so deeply rooted,\nthat must make me a knight, too! ...No?\nOh come on, you can let a man dream...
79	Cannot express with mouthwords\nhow happy Dolala to be friends with\nfriends! Dolala will aim higher than\never before to become great Driver!

83	Thanks for helping my dad out\nbefore! My belly was full and happy\nfor the first time in a long while!
84	Lord Addam, Lady Lora... The fate of\nTorna is in your hands. With the Aegis\nand the Paragon of Torna on your side,\nthere is nothing to fear! ...Right?
85	No emperor in the history of Mor\nArdain has ever garnered this much\ntrust and respect from foreigners...\nEmperor Hugo, luck be with you, sire!
86	Thanks for rolling with my old man's\nwhimsy. He's nuts for nuts and bolts...\nI don't think he even knows what I do.\nIt's kinda sad... But family's family!
87	I can't believe you beat the golden\nmonsters! Makes me feel better about\nbeing rudely disturbed like that. Shows\nof force always perk me right up!
88	Sorry much about big job hullabaloo!\nBut at least now that friends undergo\ncoaching from master warrior Rolipoli,\nshould have confidence to beat anyone!
89	I can't apologize enough for my Driver.\nStill, watching your flawless style and\nflair has inspired me. We'll work hard\nso we can show you guys up some day.

2814	That guy was pretty tough.\nBut he's still not the kind of real\nchallenge I crave.
2815	C'mon, let's go find the next\nstrong enemy! I know we can\ndo better than that last one!
2816	That was a pretty fun battle.\nBut not exactly what I was looking for.
2817	I am just ITCHING for a good fight.\nC'mon, let's go find someone strong!
2818	Nope, not this one either.\nLet's keep searching for a\nreal challenger!
2819	Pretty strong. But not strong enough.\nNext challenge, please!
2820	I hope our next battle is more\nfun than this one.
2821	There's some pretty weird enemies\naround here, huh? Not really the kind\nof foes I'm looking for, mind.
2822	Another dud. We really need to find\nstronger enemies than this!
2823	C'mon, let's go find the next one!\nNo dawdling when there's strong\nenemies out there to challenge!
2824	Well, she was stronger than the last guy.\nBut I'm still not exactly impressed.
2825	Still not quite doing it for me...\nWhere's the next challenger?!
2826	*sigh* When are we going to find the\nkind of challenge I'm really looking for?
2827	Hey, are there other strong enemies\nto fight round these parts?\nLemme have a little look around.
2828	I still haven't found a single opponent\nworthy of unleashing my full power.
2829	See, this one's not right either.\nWill this search ever end?
2830	Now this was a pretty strong opponent.\nJust...not quite the one I'm after.
2831	Well, I guess he was stronger than\nthe other Rodonya around here.
2832	How many have we defeated at this\npoint? And still no sign of the kind of\nopponent I'm really dying to meet.
2833	Nope, this one's no good!\nC'mon, on to the next!
2834	You know, I think that might've been\nthe strongest Igna I ever fought.
2835	Not as strong as I was expecting...\nBut oh well! There's always next time!
2836	Over already? What an anticlimax.\nC'mon, let's go find a different one.
2837	I'm not really feeling it...\nSometimes I start to wonder if the\nopponent I'm seeking even exists.
2838	I mean, that one was strong. Sure.\nBut it just...didn't excite me, you know?
2839	That one was all bark and no bite.\nNext opponent, here I come!
2840	When am I going to get a chance to cut\nloose and let it all out? C'mon, I know\nthere are stronger opponents out there!
2841	Next time I'll find a real challenge\nfor sure, right? Right?!
2842	That was fun! But there might be even\nmore fun battles out there somewhere.\nLet me know if you find any!
2843	That was just disappointing...\nBut hey, there's always next time!
2844	Hey, that was definitely stronger\nthan the last one.
2845	I'm still in training, anyway.\nOne day, though...
2846	Next time, let's find an even\nstronger opponent, shall we?
2847	Well, that's Argentum all well and\nsearched. Let's look somewhere\ndifferent for a challenger next!
2848	Well, that's Gormott all well and\nsearched. Let's look somewhere\ndifferent for a challenger next!

4968	Those Nomad Rhinon were\na rowdy bunch!
4969	I could make an incredible pot\nroast with this Flow Bunnit meat.\nLook forward to that!
4970	Grad Gogol... Now that's one enemy\nI won't be forgetting any time soon.
4971	The Organl Griffox must be breeding\nlike Bunnits!
4972	Bobbile Brogs are giving folk hassle,\nare they? Shame. Their expressions\nare hilarious!
4973	You know, come to think of it, how are\nSloam Runners and Chituk Rapchors\ndifferent, exactly? They look identical!
4974	There was no way we were leaving\nthose Vint Griffox unchecked.
4975	Remind me never to get on a Berserker\nMammut's bad side again.
4976	Poor Massido Ardun.\nIt knew no wrong...

4978	Bland Upa are tenacious lil' critters.\nYou've gotta be to live in these harsh\nconditions.
4979	I can tell this is going to be the\nbeginning of a beautiful friendship!
4980	I reckon Pyra could make something\ndelicious out of this River Bunnit meat!
4981	I wonder where Buma Hiln get those\nfunny objects they carry in their beaks?
4982	I thought you might be able use\na Broom Icicle as an actual broom.\nAlas, it was not to be...
4983	We really would have been better off\nletting Mor Ardain take that Tempest\nPterix down with one of their gunships.
4984	No more Nuruba Upa! Uraya should\nprobably thank us for that.
4985	Stream Navy swim around so quickly.\nThey kept slipping through my hands!
4986	Arno Kapiba look so warm and cozy...\n
4987	Whew. Sarabashi Ropl mean business!
4988	I can't imagine what you'd use\nRainbow Bugs for...
4989	Yurem Puffot plumage is just\nspectacular. Just...wow.
4990	I bet Klim Anlood are lovely and soft\nto the touch.
4991	Can't say I enjoy the whole skin-\nshedding thing Growsa Aspar do.\nThey really make life difficult!
4992	Come on, Nia, there's people in need.\nWe've gotta do our part!
4993	We could never turn down a request\nfrom Fonsett now, could we, Rex?
4994	Seems like a hard life, living in Tantal,\nZeke. I'll do whatever I can to make it\na little easier!
4995	Mor Ardain's future's not looking too\nbright, is it, Mòrag? If there's anything\nI can help you with, just tell me.
4996	Yeah, I think I'm pretty keen on bugs!
4997	Killi-Killi Killifish...\nDo I want to know what you use\nthose for?
4998	Nitrotoluite's used to make bullets,\nas I recall. Useful stuff!
4999	Is Emerald Snow pretty, or is it pretty?!\nMakes me want to start hunting for\nprecious stones...

5044	Attack is the best form of defense!\nIsn't that right?
5045	I'll try and brighten things\nup even more!
5046	I'm really getting the hang of things!
5047	I might not measure up to Pyra,\nbut I'm not doing too badly if\nI say so myself!
5048	Practice makes perfect!\nRight?
5049	Intensive training is hard work...\nPyra, tell me your secrets!
5050	I think slow and steady is more\nmy style than some kind of\nintensive all-in-one-go approach.
5051	Huh. Well, I guess even slow and\nsteady improvement isn't going\nto do much for this anymore.
5052	You mess with fire, you get burned!
5053	Practice, practice, practice! That's the\nonly route to success!
5054	Actually, I'm trying to work on\nhiding my flames so I don't set\nfire to quite as many things.
5055	Ah, forget it. There's no hiding\nthis fire!
5056	I think I'm better at attacking\nthan healing, to be honest!
5057	You don't need to heal if the enemy\nis already dead before they hit you!
5058	Finishing off an enemy really gets\nthe blood pumping. Or should that\nbe "boiling"?
5059	One day I want to hold a big fireworks\nfestival and invite Pyra. Imagine if she\ncame! I think I'd explode with joy!
5060	I wish I could fight alongside\nPyra forever...
5061	Pyra is my hero. I admire her so much!\nMythra? Who's that...?\n...Oh, *her*...
5062	When I'm around Pyra, I worry about\ndisappointing her. When I'm around\nMythra, I worry about making her mad.
5063	Mythra is pretty sharp around the\nedges, but actually I think she might\nbe quite kind at heart... Maybe?
5064	Even though I've got this ball thing,\nI'm so bad at healing... Maybe I'm just\na dumb stupid weirdo...
5065	I wonder what my Affinity is\nwith Pyra...
5066	If you're stubborn enough, you can\ntake any hit. You just say "I don't\nwanna die today!"
5067	When everyone combines their power,\nwe're like an unstoppable rocket!\nI'm giving it all I've got!
5068	Pyra is my idea of the perfect Blade.\nI want to be just like her!
5069	I may have messed up before, but\nI want to keep trying to become as\nstrong and as kind as my hero Pyra!
5070	Mythra is...well, she's mean. That's\nall there is to it. I don't respect her\nat all!
5071	I'm sorry for always acting on impulse.\nIt's just that when my emotions start to\nburn, there's nothing I can do!
5072	I'm still growing, but I'm hot on\nPyra's tail, believe me!
5073	Having someone around to look up to\nreally helps your personal growth!
5074	Yes, yes, I get it. Don't set off fireworks\nwhere veggies and fruit could be hurt...\nI won't, I promise!
5075	Eating Pyra's cooking makes me feel\nlike I can take on the world!
5076	Pyra's cooking really energizes me!
5077	So these are Addam's Supercakes...\nEating them makes me feel like\nI've gone up in the world somehow!
5078	Now this is a true Pyra masterpiece!\nSo sweet and tasty! Her greatest\ncreation! ...Oh, it's from a recipe?
5079	As soon as I make up my mind to do\nsomething, I just forge ahead and do it.\nI hope I don't cause too much trouble...
5080	If I grow closer to everyone, that means\nI'll grow closer to Pyra!
5081	I feel like I've really gotten to know\neveryone. Is the feeling mutual?

5129	My Sliding Slinger move is now\na thing of beauty. Don't you think?
5130	I'll need some more practice with this.
5131	I think it can get even better.
5132	I've got a good baseline, now it's time\nto iterate.
5133	Hundred Shells is now a force\nto be reckoned with.
5134	I'll polish up the finer points,\nthen it'll really sing.
5135	Needs more firepower.
5136	It'll be ready soon.
5137	There's no enemy who can withstand\nmy Violent Streak, not in my world,\nand not in this one, either.
5138	I don't care if you call it natural\nselection, I still feel bad about killing\ngentle herbivore indigens...
5139	When you're fighting flying indigens,\nthat's when guns really shine... But you\nreally like your melee weapons, huh.
5140	Phew, if those things attacked NLA...\nI'll have to revamp our defenses the\nnext time I'm back.
5141	If I had my Skell, that would've been\nno contest... But as things stand, at\nleast it made for a nice workout.
5142	The technology looked profoundly\nmysterious at a glance... I bet if Lin\nwas here, she'd be all over it.
5143	Tirkins, huh? I wonder if we could\nbefriend them like we did the Ma-non...
5144	Our teamwork skills have been tried,\nand we passed with flying colors.
5145	The soldiers from Mòrag's homeland\nare a competent bunch. Great small-\nunit tactics, impressive leadership.
5146	Alrest's indigens tend towards the\nsmaller end of the spectrum...\nPerfect for target practice.
5147	Annoying pests...\nI'm so glad the beaches near NLA\nare free from this kind of menace.
5148	That duo was no summer picnic.\nThey complemented each other...\nI have to respect that.
5149	I'm still in awe of that simulator.\nI need to question the Archsage,\nand get him to spill its secrets...
5150	Gormott looks so much like Noctilum...\nI wish I could explore it methodically.
5151	I've developed a soft spot for this land.\nLet's not leave yet, OK?
5152	Even though the technology in Alrest\nisn't very advanced, Blades' power can\nwreak such destruction... It's sobering.
5153	A solemn and mystical place...\nI especially liked that single shaft of\nlight. I wonder where it came from...
5154	I've never seen a place like it in my life.\nAlrest hides many unplumbed mysteries\nstill - I hope we can explore together!
5155	That's not an indigen you'd even meet\non Mira. So small, yet so ferocious...
5156	I'm a fan of all these small-sized\nindigens you've got. It's nice when\na fight ends this quickly.
5157	That indigen was unexpectedly cute,\nand I bet it'd yield some excellent\nmaterials...
5158	I wonder what the lifespan of one of\nthose indigens could be... We should\nset up a study.
5159	This would be so much easier\nif we had Skells.
5160	It's said that using Clarity Moss gives\nyou clarity... But I think in Noctilum,\nit'd just make things worse!
5161	The Dragon Incense is used to make\nmedicine, right? I'm lucky enough not\nto need it, but it's still fascinating.
5162	That's one disgusting-looking fish...\nI don't think there's any sea life\nthis grotesque on Mira...
5163	Such a beautiful stone...\nIt feels very...pure, somehow.
5164	To think that an organism would find a\nway to flourish in this environment...\nI guess life really does find a way.
5165	You use some fascinating techniques,\nI'll give you that.
5166	I think I understand the role that\nBlades play in this world...
5167	What do you think?\nFrom BLADE to Blade, eh?
5168	Meeting you all has taught me a lot.\nI'll never forget this. Thank you.

250	I reckon so!
251	Hey, Dromarch. I think this person\nmight have information for us.
252	In such cases, I find the best course\nof action is to listen to what they\nhave to say.
253	I think we need to hear the details.
254	Mythra the sort who stick her\nnose into anything!
255	Leave it to us!\nI know we can do it!
256	Just as long as you don't OVERdo it...
257	Rex. I really worked hard on this.\nI'd say I'm due a reward of some kind.
258	Huh?!\nUhm... Let me think about it.
259	Everything's fine now.\nWith me and Brighid on the case,\nhow could it not be?
260	It was the only possible outcome.
261	Ooh, this is tricky.\nWhat do you think, Mythra?
262	All I know is, worrying never\nfixes anything!
263	We'll take care of this!\nRight, Mythra?

273	Tora can handle this without even\nmaking fur of Tora sweaty!
274	I do not doubt it, my furry friend.
275	We made light work of this one!\nAren't we just the best?
276	My lady... Sometimes modesty is\nthe cardinal virtue.
277	Wow...that's about as bad as\nwhen you're salvaging and a\nGrebb comes out...
278	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]I had no idea being a salvager\nwas such a terrifying ordeal...
279	My Lady... I respectfully counsel you\nto use your best discretion here.
280	Yeah, I know. Better not make a\ndecision I'm going to regret.
281	We must solve this predicament.\nDromarch, will you assist too?

284	You have my gratitude also.
285	Are you all right?
286	Have no fear.
287	Is friend OK?
288	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Perhaps I should let Poppi handle\nthis one herself...
289	That works.

291	It sounds like something's up.
292	Poppi want more detail!

296	Yeah, me too.\nCan you give us the lowdown?
297	Leave it to us! Hey Poppi, have you\ngot a special feature to take care of\nthis in two seconds flat?
298	Poppi have many features,\nbut none quite that specialized.\nWill take at least three seconds.
299	Everything is OK now?\nAll worry is over?
300	Masterpon... Poppi think\nyou worry too hard.
301	Rex... What is best course\nof action in this situation?
302	I'm not sure myself... But if we\nwork together, I'm sure we can\ncome up with something!
303	Tora can not bear to abandon people\nwho need help. Leave it to Tora!
304	Masterpon...!\nSuch kindness! Such Heroponity!
305	Are you all right?
306	Mòrag sort out any problems!
307	Is no need to make big fuss over, really.

310	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]How is she always so cute...?
311	Hey, could Poppi talk with friend a bit?
312	We'd like to hear any interesting\nnews you might have heard.

365	No need to worry yourself!\nSquar-ha-ha-ha-hark!
366	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Roc not too good at being polite...
367	The item you desire is either in\nmy left pouch or my right pouch...\nCan you guess which one?
368	Roc... I think we can skip this.\nJust hand it over.
369	All right!
370	Very good.
371	Hello friend!\nOh, Brighid, do special greeting from\npalace you tell me about before!
372	Ah...the Ardainian ceremonial curtsey\nis reserved for certain formal situations.\nLet's just talk normally for now.
373	We will take care of it. Brighid,\nI hope you will lend me your aid.
374	But of course, Lady Mòrag.\nI hope I can satisfy your expectations.
375	Hahah! Haaaaahahah! Hahaha!\nHahahaha! HAH!
376	I think what he means to say is that the\njob presented few difficulties for him.
377	This big difficult...\nWhat Brighid think we should do?
378	Poppi, you still have so much to learn.\nWhen you get more experience, you'll\nknow what to do in times like these.
379	Lady Mòrag, if I may...
380	It's fine, Brighid, you don't have to\nsay it. Let's resolve this situation.
381	Meh! Thank you! Mehmeh!\nMehmeh! Thank you! Meh!
382	More is not always better, Tora.\nDon't you think a single thank you\nwould suffice?
383	Are you all right?!
384	Now that we're here, there is\nno need to worry.
385	Are you all right...?
386	Nothing too bad, I hope.
387	Really, it is no problem.
388	Hey, no problem.
389	Does this seem acceptable?
390	I would say so, yes.
391	Sounds like something's wrong.\nWhat do you think, Pandoria?
392	Yeah, we should find out more.
393	Poppi think we should subject\nthis person to interrogation.
394	Erm... Or we could just have\na normal conversation...
395	Hey. Why don't you tell me something\nfunny? Like, something side-splitting.
396	Oh, Mythra... If you put the pressure on\nlike that, it's impossible to be funny.
397	I reckon we ought to find out more.\nWhat d'you think, Pandoria?
398	With you on that one, Princey.\nLet's hear the details.
399	Pandoria...This won't be easy!\nI hope you're prepared!
400	It'll be fine as long as Zeke looks out\nfor us with his Eye of Shining Justice.
401	Your problems are now nothing\nmore than dust on the Purple\nLightning Dreamsmasher!
402	That's my Prince for you...
403	Pandoria... Poppi not think this\nsound very good.
404	I'm with you on that one, Poppi.
405	We're here to offer a helping hand.
406	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Wow, she really knows how to project\nconfidence. I wish my Prince knew\nhow to do that...quietly.
407	You all right there?!
408	Once my Prince busts in there with\nhis Ultimate Lightning Fury Slash,\nyour worries will be over. Probably.
409	Hey, are you sure you're OK?
410	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]I wish Zeke could show concern for\npeople like Rex does...
411	Something wrong maybe?
412	Something troublesome, I'll wager.
413	Aegaeon, I think we might have\nfound someone who can give us\nuseful information!
414	I can only hope you are correct.
415	Worry not. Brighid and I will\nhandle this task without fail!
416	Well said. We will not disappoint.
417	I feel our task has come to an end.
418	Your efforts are much appreciated,\nAegaeon.
419	This is a really tough decision.
420	Many and manifold are the\nburdens of leadership!
421	Aegaeon, if it were your call,\nwhat would you do?
422	Can there be any doubt?\nWe must help those in need!
423	Just in the nick of time!
424	It's all right now. I will protect you.
425	Please, do not concern yourself.\nIt is no problem at all.
426	Such humility... You are more like\nNiall than you know, Aegaeon.
427	We have returned.
428	Apologies for making you wait.
429	Is this acceptable?
430	I should think so, Aegaeon.
431	With this, peace is restored to\nthe world once more!
432	Tora not sure it quite such a big deal...
433	I hear it! The cosmos calling out\nfor an ally of justice!
434	I don't hear any cosmic voices,\nmyself... Though the situation\ndoes sound unfortunate.
435	This is a job for heroes like us.\nRight, Godfrey?
436	Yes! Leave it to us!\nJustice is certain to prevail!
437	Looks like we made it just in time...
438	Have no fear!\nThe upholders of justice are here!
439	On the wings of justice, we've\nreturned from our mission!
440	Simmer down a bit, will you, Godfrey?
441	Wooargh!!! Tell us useful info!!!
442	Well, you heard the scary guy.\nYou should probably spill whatever\ninfo you've got, quick.
443	Wooorgh!\nHow are you?!
444	Don't be scared... He's just\ntrying to say hello.
445	No need for worry.\nWulfric take care of this easy!
446	Woooargh!!!\nLet me at it!!!
447	Woorgh! Raargh!\nEverything's fine now!!!
448	Heheheh... That's right, Wulfric.\nEverything's taken care of.
449	I will help you! Understand?!\nMe!!! Help you!!!
450	I'm right behind you there, Wulfric.\nLet's help out!
451	It'll be tough, but we gotta do this.\nPerceval... Remember what I said\nabout teamwork this time.
452	It's inscribed on my heart, my liege.
453	Our task is done.
454	And with a minimum of effort, thanks\nto your sterling support, Perceval.
455	Yo, Perceval. What do you think\nwe should do?
456	I trust your judgment.
457	Perceval... Maybe you and the guys\ncould look into this?
458	Yes, my liege!
459	My furry companion may\nhave something for you.
460	Mehmeh!\nWhere did Tora put it...
461	Something up...?
462	It sounds more serious than\nyour everyday chit-chat.\nLet's hear the details.
463	Mòrag, this topic has caught my interest.
464	Yes... We must hear more.
465	Gorg'll make light work of this.\nHe's a guy to count on.
466	Ha! Well, I couldn't do it without you,\nZeke. But I won't let you down!
467	Gorg, what do you think?
468	We have to help. I'd say we're\nthe only ones who can!
469	Are you sure you're all right?
470	Tell Gorg if you have problem!\nMaybe he help!
471	Greetings, commoner. I wish to be\namused with some diverting stories of\nlife as a member of the common herd.
472	Erm... He means, "Hi".
473	It seems rather beneath my station\nto handle such a menial task...
474	Come now, Dagas... Is it not the duty\nof a ruler to solve the problems of the\npeople? We will take care of it.
475	Honestly, it wasn't even all that difficult.
476	Thanks to my regal grace, no doubt!\nBe grateful, commoners.
477	Meh-meh! What should Tora do?\nThinking making head hurt!
478	Commoner, do you not know there\nis no baser folly than indecision?
479	This task seems beneath me.\nLet the common Blades handle it.
480	Sure, sure... We'll accept it for now,\nand figure out who to assign later.\nNot ruling you out yet, Dagas!
481	Heard any juicy rumors lately?
482	A juicy rumor? Where? I'd eat\nthat in a baguette, with loads of\nketchup!
483	This is the kind of job I could\njust swallow whole!
484	I'm sure you can handle it, Boreas.\nBut let's try and keep the snack breaks\nin check this time, yeah?
485	Man, what a bitter situation.
486	Bitter situations? I don't like 'em!\nBut I'll still eat 'em!
487	We can handle this.\nIsn't that right, Boreas?
488	I'll do anything for a tasty treat!
489	Much thanks! Tora want to give ten\nTasty Sausages to show gratitude!
490	That's the kind of display of gratitude\nthat I like!
491	Is there something troubling you?\nMaybe you've fallen head-over-heels\nin love with me? If so, I'm sorry, but...
492	I don't think that's quite what's\ngoing on here. Something is\nbothering you though, yeah?
493	Hi there! I'm feeling pretty great today.\nYou can tell by how cute I look, see?
494	Tora feeling extra good too!\nLike eaten 100 Tasty Sausages!\n...But maybe we should let friend talk.
495	A problem safely resolved...\nall thanks to Floren here!
496	Teehee... You're making me blush.
497	Ah, this is a real mess.\nFloren, what do you reckon?
498	Um, I'm not too sure myself.\nBut I trust your judgment, Nia.
499	You can leave this to us!\nRight, Floren?
500	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Oh, Rex. Do you ever see a\ntroublesome situation and NOT\nget us all mixed up in it...?
501	We need you to fill our ears with the\nlatest gossip! Oh, that reminds me.\nTora...where do Nopon keep their ears?
502	This wing-thing actually have ear\nfunction! But right now should be\nlistening to gossip, not to Tora!
503	Come on, let's take care of it, Rex!\nOh, but we should buy a lucky charm\nfirst. Can never be too careful!
504	Erm...I'd rather skip the lucky charm bit\nand get started now, if it's all the same.
505	Why, that's terrible!\nWe should try to alleviate the\nsituation with some lucky charms!
506	Kasandra... I'm not sure that will get to\nthe root of the problem...
507	We're here to help!\nYou're down with that, right, Mòrag?
508	Indeed. The kindness in your heart,\nat least, will not lead us astray.
509	Zeke... We've got to do something\nto help!
510	Sure thing.\nWe've got the manpower for it.
511	Praxis, you look like you're about\nto explode with curiosity.
512	I can't deny it!\nI want to hear all the details!
513	This doesn't sound like an easy task...
514	Really? I think it'll be a breeze if\nthe two of us work together!
515	Hardly the toughest job we've\never faced, was it, Rex?
516	Thanks to you, it was a cinch!\nI mean, and to everyone else too...
517	This is right up our street!\nMy whole body's itching to get\nstuck in and sort everything out!
518	Yeah, I can feel my Eye of Shining\nJustice tingling with anticipation too.
519	You are safe now! Leave this to us!
520	And that's the Flamebringer talking,\nso you know she means it!
521	Hmmm...? Is something up?
522	Go on, Rex.\nFind out what this is about.
523	We've got this one covered!\nWe'll sort everything out in a jif.\nRight, Theory?
524	Yes. We'll give it our all.
525	This is a difficult problem...
526	Indeed. But that is precisely why\nwe must remain calm and consider\nit carefully.
527	Theory... I think we should help,\ndon't you?
528	I agree...
529	Hmmm... What d'you think, Theory?
530	I'm a little concerned.\nAre you all right?
531	It is precisely in times of difficulty\nthat we must work together.\nOnward!
532	Well said, Perun!\nI know you can do this!\nNo...WE can do this!
533	I guess we can rest easy now.\nRight, Perun?
534	I'm just glad we could be of some use!
535	Perun. The time for us to help\nthose in need is at hand.
536	Indeed. I'll give it my all, body and soul!
537	Hahah! You really think that would\nbe a problem for the Zekenator?!
538	Zeke, maybe it's not my place to say,\nbut you could try to show just a little\nbit of humility sometimes?
539	Here is what you seek.\nWe offer it humbly.
540	Perun very sophisticated sometimes...\nTora should model this behavior in\nnew subroutine for Poppi...
541	Ooh, it sounds like there's something\nbothering you? Tell us everything!\nFrom the lowdown to the wild rumors!
542	We can probably skip the wild rumors...
543	I'm Kora! And I want all your gossip!\nAnd right after, you get all mine!
544	Kora... You might have to tell them\nabout your new haircut some other\ntime.
545	Hey, how have you been, stranger?\nDoing good? Yeah, I bet.\nWell, as for me, I've been...
546	Kora! They don't need your\nlife story! We want to hear\nwhat they have to say...
547	Can you give us the relevant details?
548	Yeah, just the relevant details!\nNo unnecessary gossip at all!\nThough if you reeeeally want to...
549	Tora and friends handle this easy!\nWith Kora and Poppi on job too,\nthere no way we can fail!
550	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]The little bag of fluff isn't filling me full\nof confidence for some reason...
551	Hey, Mythra, just a heads-up...\nI'm going to take care of this one\nso well, it'll make you look bad!
552	Hoping to show your Driver what\nyou can do? Well, so am I.\nHow about we both give it our all?
553	Well, that's that!
554	I for one will be sleeping a\nwhole lot better tonight!
555	At the hands of the Flamebringer,\nall troubles are swiftly reduced to ash!\nHeheheh...
556	Oh, she exaggerates...
557	Well, this does not sound like a whole\nbunch of fun, huh, Rex?
558	Yeah, it sounds pretty bad...
559	Poppi... You're a big girl now.\nMaybe you know how to handle\nthis kind of thing?
560	As mature person, Poppi know\nthat problem best solved by\nall discuss together.
561	Ah, this is tough...
562	Rex, I just want to say, we're all 100%\nbehind you, because we like, trust you.
563	Hey, Zeke. I bet your Eye of Shining\nJustice would take care of this in a\njiffy. Am I right?
564	Well...yeah...but because I'm so\nawesome, I can do this without even\nbusting out that forbidden power!
565	We'll have this right as rain\nin a jiffy! With a party like this,\nanything's possible!
566	Kora right! Tora and Kora and friends\ncan take care of this!
567	Kora, we can fix this if we work\ntogether, right?
568	Don't doubt it, girl! It'll be a great\nchance for catch-up and a gossip, too.
569	Thank you most kindly.
570	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]I wish I could be as classy\nas Brighid...
571	Are you OK? Zeke's here to\nZekify you or whatever.
572	Hahahah!\nSeriously though. Here to help.
573	Is friend OK?
574	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Poppi's so kind and thoughtful... I hope\nshe stays that way as she grows up.
575	It's no problem really.
576	Oh, Rex! You're so charming\nwhen you act humble!
577	We're back! That wait must've been\npretty boring for you, huh?\nNice work toughing it out!
578	Not everyone finds inactivity quite\nas intolerable as you do, Kora.
579	Here you go! You want this, right?\nNot going to be using it for\nanything mischievous, I hope?
580	I know you love gossip, Kora,\nbut you're reaching there.
581	Yeah! Hey Poppi, isn't this the kind of\nsituation where you'd say "Meh-meh!"\nor something?
582	Meaning of "meh" change with\ntonal variation. Kora just say\nsomething very rude.
583	Hey, you got any info for us?\nActually, Azami, maybe you could use\nyour Clairvoyant Eye to find out...
584	No, thank you. I mostly try to save\nthat power for spying on my Driver's\ninnermost thoughts...
585	Tell us all the details. Everything.\nIf you leave anything out, I'll peer into\nyour very soul and find out for myself.
586	You should watch out.\nI think she might actually be serious.
587	My beloved Driver spent valuable\ntime fixing this mess for you. I think\na little gratitude is in order!
588	C'mon, Azami. You got to spend time\nwith your...beloved Driver...too,\nso it's all good, right?
589	Heheheh... It's somehow thrilling to\nsee my Driver look so perturbed.
590	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]I need to clear this up as soon\nas possible and save face...
591	Azami... You OK to help out, right?\nMaking very scary face...
592	If my beloved Driver desires it,\nI will of course assist.
593	I think we need to hear some details.\nYou with me, Ursula?
594	Y-yes, I think so too.
595	Ursula and Beary solve everything!\nIn battle, they like giants playing\nping-pong with enemy as ball!
596	We didn't really...do anything special...
597	...Rex?
598	Yeah... I know what you're about to say,\nUrsula. Of course we'll take the job on.
599	Um, um... Th-thank you.
600	Sterling work, Ursula.\nIt's good to show gratitude.
601	Are you...OK?
602	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Ursula gets shy in this kind of\nsituation...but she confronts it bravely.
603	Hi there. Good to see you.
604	Tora happy to see Newt too!\n...Wait, Newt not talking to Tora.\nNow Tora embarrassed.
605	Hmm, this is a tough situation.\nI say we just get out there, and\npound this problem to a pulp!
606	Well, that's...one way of handling it.
607	Are you OK? I'll lend you\nmy arms if you like...
608	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Hang on, are those things\ndetachable?
609	That is quite all right, I assure you.\nI am sure my companions would\nsay the same.
610	Mòrag has such great manners...\nI should try to follow her example.
611	That'll do it!
612	Yup. Let's get going!
613	Mòrag... This person smells like they're\nripe with useful info!
614	Really? Then we should hear them out.
615	We can take care of this easily!\nSee, even Kit and Sunny are up for it!
616	Well, that's good to hear.\nLet's do it together!
617	Ah, what a mess.\nNim, what do you think?
618	Kit's saying one thing, Sunny's saying\nsomething else... So I have no idea!
619	We've got to help.\nI feel it in my bones!
620	Tora trust Nim's instincts!\nLet's do job!
621	Hey, thanks for waiting.\nAs you can see, we're back.
622	You make it sound so easy, Nim.\nIt was actually pretty hard work!
623	I wonder if this person's got any\nuseful info for us...
624	Useful information pleases us.\nBut only that which is provided for free.\nWe do not approve of extortion.
625	A detailed explanation may be in order.
626	Are you certain? Once we hear the\ndetails, there's no going back...
627	A happy conclusion. Now, for our\nreward - will it be mountains of riches?\nOr a lovely maiden's hand in marriage?
628	Sheba... Shut it!
629	We shall offer our assistance,\nfor the price of 200 thousand G.
630	Sheba... Be serious.\nDon't worry, we're here to help,\nnot to empty your wallet.
631	A little compensation in hard cash\nwould not go amiss.
632	Mehmeh! Sheba never stop\nthinking of money...
633	Hello there!\nWhy don't we have a chat\nover a few tasty dumplings?
634	Vess... You really should check\nif people are hungry before you\noffer them food.
635	Everything went so smoothly\nthanks to Mòrag here.\nI hardly had to do a thing.
636	I'm sorry if I stole your thunder,\nVess. I'll be sure to put you on\nthe front lines next time!
637	This might be a bit of a challenge.\nBut you'll give it your all, right, Tora?
638	Meh-meh-meh?! What about Vess?\nVess need to help out too!
639	Cheers and stuff.
640	Nia... Can't you say thank-you\nproperly?
641	Here you go!\nA tasty dumpling, just for you!
642	Erm...Vess? That's not what we're\nmeant to be handing over. ...Here,\nthis is what she meant to give you.
643	Rex! My scientific curiosity is tingling!\nI need you to extract all the details,\nright now!
644	Y-yeah, OK. Let's hear it.\nJust...try to maybe tone down\nthe excitement a little, Adenine.
645	Well...I suppose that's another job\nover and done with. *sigh*
646	Adenine...you could act a little more\npleased that the problem is solved.
647	Ooh...! That sounds really intriguing!\nI mean, really terrible!
648	Adenine... You have literally\nno tact, do you? I guess that's\nkind of your schtick...
649	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Heheheh... Helping out here will\nsurely yield results of priceless\nscientific value!
650	...Please ignore creepy smile\nof Adenine. We help out.
651	Are you OK? Tell me what the\nproblem is. If it's interesting enough,\nI might make it an object of study.
652	Honestly, Adenine, I'm starting\nto worry about you too.\n...Seriously though, you all right?
653	You got a minute to talk?
654	We want to hear any gossip\nyou might have.
655	Electra... I may require your\nassistance with this task.
656	Anything I can do to help, Mòrag!
657	There's not a problem in the world\nthat can't be fixed with a good stare\nfrom the Eye of Shining Justice!
658	Great! You can handle the next\njob all by yourself then, Zeke!
659	We can't just stand by and do\nnothing. Let's take care of this.\nElectra, are you with me?
660	I'll do everything in my power!\nMind you don't get zapped by\nmy lightning, Rex!
661	Ah... Are you OK?
662	Meh-meh... Worry-worry...
663	I want to hear any gossip you have.\nBut keep it as brief as you can.\nMy attention span's not up to much!
664	No, please take your time.\nDetails are important.
665	Well, we sorted that one out\ngood and proper!
666	Yeah! Can we do a mission with\nmore terrifying enemies to fight\nnext time, though?
667	Turned out to be pretty easy.\nEspecially with Zenobia's help.
668	Easy is right! I nearly passed\nout from the boredom...
669	This sounds like a pretty boring job...\nI know! I'll get the other Blades to do it!
670	At least pretend to have a little\ntact, would you? Don't worry,\nwe'll take the job.
671	Hey! Are you OK?!\nI'll clear those nasties out in a jiffy!
672	Zenobia very strong so no need\nfor worrying!
673	Oh hey, you're...uhm...Doddi Blodson...\nNo, Diddi Bladsod...Denni Blimstaff...\nWell, good to see you!
674	Friend not worry. Finch always get\nname of everyone wrong. Anyway,\nwas something bothering friend?
675	I think we need to hear some\ndetails, don't we, Finch?
676	Yep! Of course, I'll have forgotten\neverything in about five minutes,\nbut I still wanna hear.
677	You and me got this one covered,\ndon't we, Nina?
678	Sure, Finch. We can handle it\nif we work together!\nJust one thing...my name's Nia.
679	Morodge! Sounds like something fun's\ngoing down!
680	I don't know about fun...but I do\nbelieve we can help. And for the\nlast time, my name is Mòrag!
681	Hahahah! A problem like this is\nnothing for the Finchinator!\n...How's my impression of you, Zeke?
682	Really. That's not how I talk.\nI'm about 500% more bombastic\nthan that!
683	Nothing's too difficult with you\naround, KOS-MOS! Right?
684	Affirmative. I will function to\nthe extent of my abilities.
685	Every job seems easy with\nKOS-MOS helping out.
686	Affirmative. Performance evaluation\nreveals a high level of efficiency.
687	That sounds quite unfortunate...\nKOS-MOS, what do you think?
688	I concur.
689	Don't worry, we'll handle this.\nWith a success rate of 500%!
690	I calculate the actual likelihood\nof Zeke being successful to be\napproximately 54.678034%.
691	Tora and friends all back!
692	Reporting in. Task accomplished.
693	Hey, Herald. Time to turn the charm on.\nGo on, give 'em your best smile!
694	...Greetings.
695	With Herald in tow, we'll have this\nZekenated in no time.
696	Agreed. Let's not overdo it, though...
697	Herald... Give me your counsel.\nThis task is within our power, I hope?
698	Indeed, my Lady.\nI will not let you down.
699	Herald want to help out?
700	I have no particular desire to take this\nmission, but I will do as I am ordered.
701	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]I want to offer emotional support,\nbut people are usually scared of me...\nI'd better leave it to Rex.
702	Are you all right?
703	Somethin' wrong, hon?\nAnything we can help you out with?
704	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Dahlia is extraordinarily\nempathic at times...
705	Could you fill us in on the\ndetails, darlin'?
706	Tora want to hear too!
707	Ah...I gotta make the right call here.
708	Aw, hon, don't get too worked\nup over it. I'm sure whatever you\ndecide'll be dandy.
709	Shucks, one o' us lot can take care\no' that, don't you worry, hon.
710	Dahlia, you're my kind of gal.
711	Why, thank ya kindly!\n...Did I say it right, Dahlia?
712	You're a real fast learner, hon.
713	If you know anything useful,\nspit it out. And on the double!
714	Vale... You're overdoing\nthe menace a bit there...
715	You want my honest opinion?\nI've had more exciting jobs.
716	Every job just too easy for\nTora and friends!
717	Hahah...\nAn amusing twist of fate.
718	I don't think that's a very\nappropriate comment, Vale...
719	If you beg for assistance,\nwe might be willing to help...
720	Vale... C'mon.\nLet's just...help out.
721	Hah... As if I care.
722	You never do like to show weakness,\ndo you, Vale?
723	I'm pretty intrigued right now.\nZeke, don't you want to hear\nthe details?
724	Yeah. The Zekenator's ears\nare like...hungry mouths.\nUh, metaphorically speaking.
725	Agate just the kind of skilled\nBlade can pull this off!
726	Yeah! Let's do it! Oh...but if we come\nacross any creepy-crawlies, I'll let you\nhandle that, Tora.
727	I'd like to help, but I dunno...
728	It's OK! If we all pitch in, we can do it!
729	We managed to get this thanks\nto everyone's efforts!
730	Indeed. Here, you may have the spoils.
731	Yeah!
732	Very good.
733	Graagh! Give it up!
734	What he means to say is, we would\nappreciate it if you could share any\nuseful information you may have.
735	Heheheh...\nI can't wait to strike this problem\ndown with deadly force.
736	That's great and all, but do you have\nto make it sound so...dastardly?
737	Here. Take it quick,\nbefore I eat it!
738	Sever...you wouldn't actually eat\nit after all the trouble we went to\nto get it, would you?
739	All right! That's that, then!
740	I tire of these minor tasks...
741	Tell me your woes, your hopes\nand dreams. Drama is the muse\non which my writing depends!
742	Can you not just ask "Is something\nwrong?" like a normal person...?
743	I trust you are well? Me and my\nstrange companion here would\nlike to converse with you.
744	Watch who you're calling strange!\nBut yeah, we were wondering if you\nhad anything fun to talk about.
745	I'd love to help! I was thinking of\nwriting a scene just like this, so\nthis will be the perfect inspiration!
746	Your motives might not be pure,\nbut I suppose if the job gets done...
747	We're back!
748	Ah, a dramatic reunion.
749	Well, that's that taken care of!\nThanks for helping out with that,\nPatroka!
750	Yeah, whatever.
751	Mòrag. You take care of this.
752	Excuse me?! This hardly seems a job\nfor me alone... But I feel certain we\nhave people who can handle it.
753	Go on now, Patroka.\nSay thank you.
754	Hmph... How about you say it yourself?
755	You OK there?!
756	No need to get so worried.
757	What's up? Something the matter?\nYou can tell Mik.
758	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]He can be a little overfamiliar at times...
759	Mik, this is just the kind of task that\na pair of wild-eyed riders of the storm\nlike us eat for breakfast, right?
760	Zeke, with you as my wingman,\nanything is possible!
761	Mòrag... Has anyone ever told you\nthat you look hot when you're\nstruggling to decide something?
762	This is not the time for jokes.
763	Eheheh... Thanks for the sentiment.\nReally though, it's no problem.
764	Nia, you're pretty charming\nwhen you get flustered.
765	We can do this!\nWe can do this!\nC'mon, Nia! Join in with the chant!
766	What?! I'm up for doing this,\nbut I'm not chanting anything!
767	Even the most tragic of circumstances\ncan be sweetened with a bowl of that\ngood Tantalese Porridge!
768	Obrona... Not the time!
769	Call my name and I appear!\nIt's Obrona!
770	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]I don't recall anyone calling her...\nBut perhaps it's easier not to\nsay anything.
771	Hah! You think that's a problem\nfor us? It's, like, nothing!
772	Erm... Obrona, that's not\nthe way to be humble...
773	Hi there.\nAnything you want to talk about?
774	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Rex is so skilled at naturally\nbreaking the ice...\nLike a finely-honed sword!
775	Let's hear the details.
776	Agreed.
777	C'mon, we can't leave 'em like this.\nYou'll help, right, Perdido?
778	As you wish.
779	You all right there?
780	I hope so.
781	Hey, Zeke. I think something's\nbothering this little one here.
782	Looks like it. Let's hear the details.
783	Hey, let's talk!\nI'll give you my autograph if you want!
784	[ML:Feeling kind=Think ]Not such a tempting offer...
785	The mighty Cressidus will make\nlight work of this!
786	Well, if you say so, Cressidus.\nWe'll take the job!
787	Here, I think this may be what\nyou are after.
788	You better take it quickly,\nor I might crush it by accident!

2	Time to earn your lunch!\nTo initiate combat, the first thing Rex needs\nto do is [System:Color name=tutorial ]draw his weapon[/System:Color].
3	To draw your weapon, simply press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=A ]\n[/System:Color]while [System:Color name=tutorial ]targeting an enemy[/System:Color]. To display the target,\njust press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=R ][/System:Color].
4	You can tell which enemy you're targeting by\nthe [System:Color name=tutorial ]target marker[/System:Color] displayed above its head.
5	Incidentally, you can also [System:Color name=tutorial ]sheathe your weapon [/System:Color]if\nyou'd rather not continue a fight. It's as simple as\nholding down [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=R ] [/System:Color]and pressing [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=B ][/System:Color].
6	If you approach the [System:Color name=tutorial ]targeted enemy[/System:Color] with your\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]weapon drawn[/System:Color], you'll execute attacks automatically.\nThis is your standard [System:Color name=tutorial ]auto-attack[/System:Color].
7	Got all that? Then it's time to [System:Color name=tutorial ]draw your\nweapon [/System:Color]and start preparing your lunch!
8	Auto-attacks are delivered in [System:Color name=tutorial ]sets of three[/System:Color].\nThe attack power increases with each blow.
9	It's also good to keep in mind that auto-attacks\nhave an [System:Color name=tutorial ]optimal distance[/System:Color]. Keep the perfect distance\nfrom your enemy to maximize damage!
10	Take a look at the icons in the [System:Color name=tutorial ]lower right[/System:Color]\nof the screen. When one of these activates,\nit means an [System:Color name=tutorial ]Art[/System:Color] is ready to use.
11	[System:Color name=tutorial ]Arts[/System:Color] are [System:Color name=tutorial ]special techniques[/System:Color] distinct from auto-attacks.\nThe icons are laid out like the controller buttons,\nso just press the [System:Color name=tutorial ]corresponding button[/System:Color] to use one!
12	After using an [System:Color name=tutorial ]Art[/System:Color], you'll have to wait until the\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]recharge gauge[/System:Color] surrounding the icon has refilled\nbefore you can use it again.
13	The [System:Color name=tutorial ]recharge gauge[/System:Color] will refill as you\nauto-attack enemies.
14	Try pressing [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=X ] [/System:Color]now to let rip\nwith Rex's[System:Color name=tutorial ] Anchor Shot[/System:Color] Art.
15	The enemy just dropped something!\nThis is an item called an [System:Color name=tutorial ]HP Potion[/System:Color].
16	Maneuver Rex to the [System:Color name=tutorial ]HP Potion[/System:Color] to pick it up.\nIt'll [System:Color name=tutorial ]restore some of his HP[/System:Color].
17	Some [System:Color name=tutorial ]Arts[/System:Color], like [System:Color name=tutorial ]Anchor Shot[/System:Color], will always cause the\nenemy to drop an [System:Color name=tutorial ]HP Potion[/System:Color].
18	Should you use your Arts immediately to deal serious\ndamage, or save them for when you need bonuses like\nthat HP boost? Consider your [System:Color name=tutorial ]Arts tactics[/System:Color] carefully!
19	See that aura effect glowing around the enemy?\nThis indicates that the enemy is in a [System:Color name=tutorial ]rage state[/System:Color].
20	Certain enemies have a tendency to become enraged\nwhen their [System:Color name=tutorial ]HP dips below a certain level[/System:Color].
21	Enemies' stats will increase when enraged, so be\ncareful - they might be tougher than you expect!
22	Rex has been brought back from death's door\nas the Driver of the Aegis.
23	See the gauge that just filled up?\nThat's the icon for your [System:Color name=tutorial ]Special[/System:Color].
24	Right, now let's talk [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Combos[/System:Color].
25	【ボタンチャレンジ】\n
26	Just now, Pyra activated a [System:Color name=tutorial ]special effect[/System:Color] that\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]boosts your accuracy[/System:Color]. This type of in-battle\nassistance is called a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Art[/System:Color].
27	【必殺技①】
28	You should try out a Blade Combo going from a\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Fire-element [/System:Color]Special to a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Water-element [/System:Color]one.\nFirst up, trigger Pyra's [System:Color name=tutorial ]level 1[/System:Color] Special!
29	【ブレイドとのキズナ】
30	【属性コンボ②】\n
31	It's time you learned to take your teamwork to the\nnext level. Introducing [System:Color name=tutorial ]Chain Attacks[/System:Color], a way for your\nwhole party to deal massive damage to the enemy!
32	Finally, Pyra has tapped into her true power.\nIn this tutorial, I'll explain about making the most\nof her in her ascended state.
33	You're up against a whole bunch of fierce opponents!\nHere's a little tip that might come in handy when\ntaking on multiple enemies.
34	That Vandham guy is a pretty effective teacher.\nThanks to his lesson, Rex's [System:Color name=tutorial ]Anchor Shot[/System:Color] Art now\nhas the ability to inflict [System:Color name=tutorial ]Topple[/System:Color] on foes!
35	Let me tell you about a special [System:Color name=tutorial ]three-person attack[/System:Color],\nwhich only Rex can use.
36	【エネミーの怒り状態】
37	【抜刀/納刀/おびき寄せ】\n
38	【回復ポット】\n
39	【戦闘不能】\n
40	Looks like one of you has inflicted [System:Color name=tutorial ]Break[/System:Color]!
41	【ロール】\n
42	Well now! It seems it's finally time to talk about\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]level 4 Specials[/System:Color].
43	【ボタンチャレンジ】
44	To link a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Combo[/System:Color], you'll need to use a Special \n[System:Color name=tutorial ]one level higher[/System:Color] than the previous one. I'll bump Nia's\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Special gauge[/System:Color] up to [System:Color name=tutorial ]level 2[/System:Color], so press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=ZL ][/System:Color] to trigger it!
45	【ブレイドアーツ】
46	You may have got the gist for yourself already, but\nlet me go into a little more detail on [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Combos[/System:Color].
47	Now that you've got three people on your team,\nI'll give you a quick primer on the [System:Color name=tutorial ]sealing effects[/System:Color]\nof [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Combos[/System:Color].
48	Before you help Nia out, let me explain a little\nabout how to fight when you have multiple Drivers\nin your party.
49	【ブレイドチェンジ】
50	【特殊ブレイドチェンジ・ヒカリ】\n
51	Let me tell you a few things you might find useful!\nFirst up, I'll explain the regular view.
52	まずは通常画面の説明をしたいと思います
53	See what the arrow is pointing to right now?\nThat's the [System:Color name=tutorial ]compass[/System:Color].
54	The mark on the compass indicates the direction\nthat Rex should be heading in.
55	The [System:Color name=tutorial ]digits[/System:Color] above the mark on the compass show the\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]distance to your destination[/System:Color].
56	If Rex's destination is higher than his current position,\nthen you'll see a little arrow [System:Color name=tutorial ]above [/System:Color]the marker.
57	Conversely, if it's at a lower altitude than Rex's\ncurrent position, then the arrow will be displayed\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]below [/System:Color]the mark.
58	Next up, let's take a look at the [System:Color name=tutorial ]environmental\ninformation[/System:Color] that the arrow mark is pointing to\nright now.
59	This will key you into info about your immediate\nsurroundings, like the [System:Color name=tutorial ]weather[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]time of day[/System:Color], and so on.
60	You should keep in mind that Alrest's environments\ncan change as you continue on your adventure.
61	These changes will never put Rex's life in\nimmediate danger...
62	But they may well affect the enemies and townsfolk\nyou'll run into, so it's worth keeping an eye on the\nworld around you!
63	Next, the [System:Color name=tutorial ]mini-map[/System:Color]! You can use this to get\na quick grasp of Rex's surroundings.
64	The yellow marker in the middle shows Rex's current\nlocation, and the direction he's facing.
65	Push [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=L3 ][/System:Color] to switch between a full-screen or\nmini-map view.
66	Confident adventurers might prefer to make their way\nthrough Alrest without using the mini-map.
67	Lastly, we have the "[System:Color name=tutorial ]Current Objective[/System:Color]".\nAs you might expect, this tells you exactly what\nRex is supposed to be doing at the present time.
68	You can toggle its visibility with [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=ZR ][/System:Color], so\ntake a look if you're ever unsure about what to do next.
69	Right now, it's telling you to go and pay a visit to\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Melolo[/System:Color] at the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Central Exchange[/System:Color], so try doing that!
70	Looks like our adventure's about to really get going!\nAnd you can count on me to offer timely explanations\nof any new game features you encounter!
71	When you close this tutorial screen, you'll see\n"[System:Color name=tutorial ]Goldmouth Return Port[/System:Color]" pop up on the screen.\nThis is letting you know you've found a [System:Color name=tutorial ]landmark[/System:Color].
72	The other types of area that you'll encounter\nare [System:Color name=tutorial ]locations [/System:Color]and [System:Color name=tutorial ]Secret Areas[/System:Color].
73	When you've discovered a landmark, you can return to\nit instantly with [System:Color name=tutorial ]Skip Travel[/System:Color], at any time.
74	Skip Travel is a handy feature that lets you [System:Color name=tutorial ]travel\ninstantly[/System:Color] to places that you've already visited.
75	There's one more thing I should tell you about\nSecret Areas and landmarks.
76	If you're defeated in battle, you'll be returned to the\nlast landmark that you visited.
77	Alrest has a great variety of landmarks, so discover\nas many as you can to help you on your adventure!
78	Time to learn about [System:Color name=tutorial ]salvaging[/System:Color]!\nThe icon you can see in front of Rex right now\nmarks what we call a "[System:Color name=tutorial ]Salvage Point[/System:Color]".
79	As long as you have [System:Color name=tutorial ]cylinders[/System:Color] handy,\nyou can go salvaging at one of these points\nat any time.
80	Follow the on-screen instructions and [System:Color name=tutorial ]hit the\nbuttons at just the right time[/System:Color] to get your hands\non some treasure.
81	Time it right, and you'll get high-quality treasure.\nBut if your timing's off, the value of the treasure\nwill decrease.
82	Worse still, you might even find yourself hauling up\na fearsome enemy, so be careful!
83	There are Salvage Points all over Alrest, and the\ntype of treasure varies from point to point, so if\nyou find a new one, be sure to give it a try!
84	By the way, if you're short on cylinders,\nyou can buy them at any [System:Color name=tutorial ]salvager's shop[/System:Color].\nYou'll find these shops all across Alrest.
85	An expensive cylinder is likely to get you better\nquality treasure, but even a cheap one can yield\na decent haul. So use your gold as you see fit!
86	For the moment, you'd better use the cylinder that\nRurui gave you, and see how it goes!
87	Hold up a second! Before I forget, I should\nprobably explain how to control the [System:Color name=tutorial ]camera[/System:Color]!
88	The camera has two modes: [System:Color name=tutorial ]manual [/System:Color]and [System:Color name=tutorial ]auto[/System:Color].
89	To use [System:Color name=tutorial ]manual mode[/System:Color], just [System:Color name=tutorial ]use [ML:icon icon=R3 ][/System:Color] to point the\ncamera in whichever direction you like.
90	If you [System:Color name=tutorial ]press [ML:icon icon=R3 ][/System:Color] while the camera's in manual mode,\nthe camera will hone in on Rex's back and follow\nhim around.
91	This is what we call [System:Color name=tutorial ]auto mode[/System:Color].
92	You can also adjust the camera's [System:Color name=tutorial ]height and zoom[/System:Color].\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Hold down [ML:icon icon=L ] and move [ML:icon icon=R3 ] left and right [/System:Color]to adjust\ncamera height, or [System:Color name=tutorial ]up and down [/System:Color]to adjust zoom.
93	If you experiment with different camera angles, then\nyou might be able to spot a few things that you might\notherwise have missed, so give it a try!
94	Let me quickly explain about [System:Color name=tutorial ]lodgings[/System:Color]. When you take\na [System:Color name=tutorial ]short rest[/System:Color] in a lodging facility like an inn, you can use\nany [System:Color name=tutorial ]bonus EXP[/System:Color] you've earned to boost your level!
95	Bonus EXP is the experience that you earn when\ncompleting quests or discovering landmarks. Be sure\nto rest at inns on occasion so you can use it!
96	レベルの上げ方は\n【すべてオート】【選択オート】【マニュアル】の\n3種類があります
97	すべてオートを選ぶと\nボーナス経験値を使い切るまで　レベルアップします
98	選択オートを選ぶと　キャラクターごとにオートかマニュアルかを\n選ぶことができます
99	While resting up, you can increase your characters'\nlevels as much or as little as you like as long as you\nhave the bonus EXP to spare.
100	If you've come up against a foe that you just can't beat,\ndo a few quests to build up your bonus EXP, then go to\na lodging facility and level up!
101	On the other hand, if you're the type that likes a\nchallenge, you're free to never level up at lodgings\nat all. It can be fun to live dangerously!
102	あと　宿屋では【雲海の満ち引きが変わるまで休む】\nという役割もあります
103	アルストには雲海の満ち引きによって\n行ける場所　行けなくなる場所があるので\nそんな時は　宿屋で一休みすると良いでしょう
104	Anyway, you've got a big day ahead of you tomorrow.\nYou'd better get some shut-eye!
105	What you're looking at right now is a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Collection Point[/System:Color].\nCheck here to uncover [System:Color name=tutorial ]collectible items[/System:Color].
106	You'll find Collection Points all over Alrest, and each\narea will have its own selection of items to discover.
107	Also, there are some Collection Points where you can\nuse Blades' [System:Color name=tutorial ]Field Skills[/System:Color] to find special collectible items\nthat you couldn't get otherwise.
108	The collectibles that you find are sure to come in handy\nduring your adventure, so if you come across a Collection\nPoint, be sure to check it out!
109	Looks like something's blocking your way up ahead.\nBut if your Blades have the right [System:Color name=tutorial ]Field Skills[/System:Color], then you\nmight be able overcome obstacles like this!
110	Try investigating that [System:Color name=tutorial ]fallen tree[/System:Color].
111	As you can see, you used Pyra's [System:Color name=tutorial ]Fire Mastery[/System:Color] to\nburn it up and get it out of your way.
112	If you want to see all the Field Skills Pyra can use,\ngo to [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Characters [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Setup [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Info[/System:Color].
113	There's a lot of places in Alrest that you won't be able\nto get to if you don't have the right Field Skills.
114	Even if an obstacle seems impassable at first,\nit's worth getting a bit closer to see if you can\ndo something about it.
115	Anyway, let's keep moving and see if we can\nfind Nia anywhere!
116	You can now use the Change Time feature to\nskip instantly to whatever time of day you prefer.\nThat's pretty handy!
117	Both people and enemies may behave differently\ndepending on the time of day.
118	Even if you've already explored an area in the day,\nvisiting it after dark might yield new discoveries\nyou'd never dreamed of!
119	A number of shops are now available for you to use!\nYou'll find a whole range of different traders as you\njourney across Alrest.
120	There are [System:Color name=tutorial ]trading shops [/System:Color]where you can trade items\nyou've found, [System:Color name=tutorial ]informants[/System:Color] who sell valuable information,\nor [System:Color name=tutorial ]lifestyle shops[/System:Color] for your everyday needs.
121	You'll also come across [System:Color name=tutorial ]salvager's shops[/System:Color] for stocking\nup on cylinders, or [System:Color name=tutorial ]accessory shops[/System:Color] where you can buy\nuseful items to wear.
122	You may have already come across some of these,\nof course. From now on, feel free to make use of any\nof the categories of shop I just mentioned!
123	Argentum Trade Guild is known as the hub of Alrest's\ncommerce, so naturally, you'll find a plethora of\ndifferent shops here.
124	While you're here, you should make sure you've got\neverything you need before you head out on your\nadventures!
125	Oh! I almost forgot to tell you about something\nimportant...Rex's [System:Color name=tutorial ]pouch[/System:Color]!
126	Rex never goes anywhere without his handy pouch.\nIt's great for putting his [System:Color name=tutorial ]favorite items [/System:Color]inside so that\nhe always has them close to hand.
127	Rex's pouch isn't that big - it can hold just\none handy item at a time.
128	So what should you put in your pouch? Well, usually\nthe sort of everyday items you'll find at lifestyle shops.\nJust keeping them close by can have all sorts of effects!
129	There are 12 different types of lifestyle shops\nacross Alrest, so if you encounter a new one,\nbe sure to check it out!
130	You finally got that [System:Color name=tutorial ]Abyss Vest [/System:Color]you always wanted!\nIt'll boost your maximum HP by 24%.
131	Right now, the Abyss Vest is the only accessory you\nhave, but you're sure to encounter a whole lot more\nduring your adventure!
132	Just remember, you'll need to equip accessories\nto benefit from their effects. Go to [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu [/System:Color]>\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Characters [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Character Setup [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Accessories[/System:Color] to do so.
133	You accepted a [System:Color name=tutorial ]quest[/System:Color]! There are two types of quest:\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]regular quests[/System:Color], and ones that are part of the [System:Color name=tutorial ]main story[/System:Color].
134	You'll need to complete main story quests to advance\nthe main story. The direction of the next location is\nshown on the compass as a [System:Color name=tutorial ]pink exclamation mark icon[/System:Color].
135	Alrest is full of people who could use a little help.\nYou'll be able to spot them pretty easily, since they'll\nhave a [System:Color name=tutorial ]blue question mark icon [/System:Color]above their heads.
136	If you speak to them, they'll usually open up to you\nabout their problems and request some kind of help.\nThese are the regular quests that I mentioned earlier!
137	I'm sure if you manage to solve their problems,\nthey'll give you some kind of reward for your trouble!
138	Ordinary quests aren't vital for the main story. Follow\nthe [System:Color name=tutorial ]blue exclamation mark icon [/System:Color]to get to the next\ndestination.
139	Now here's an important point to keep in mind:\nThe destination marker on the compass will only\nbe shown for the currently [System:Color name=tutorial ]active [/System:Color]quest.
140	You can change which quest is active\nfrom your [System:Color name=tutorial ]Quest Log[/System:Color] in the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu[/System:Color].
141	But remember: you can only have one\nquest set to active at any given time.
142	There's no limit to the number of quests that you can\naccept though, so it's a smart idea to speak to everyone\nyou meet with a question mark icon over their heads!
143	You've just acquired new comrades to accompany\nyou on your adventure! You can adjust the setup of\nyour party in [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Characters [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Change Order[/System:Color].
144	No matter how many friends you make, you will never\nbe able to take more than [System:Color name=tutorial ]three party members [/System:Color]into\nbattle at once, so choose carefully!
145	The character set to [System:Color name=tutorial ]No. 1 [/System:Color]in Change Order will\nbe the [System:Color name=tutorial ]character that you control[/System:Color].
146	No two characters fight in exactly the same way,\nso you should experiment with a few and find\nwho fits your play style the best.
147	I'm sure you're itching to get searching for Gramps\nand Nia, but I should warn you that you'll probably\nencounter a few enemies on the way!
148	You'll want to be prepared for that, so I'd better\nquickly fill you in on how Rex gets stronger and\nimproves his capabilities.
149	Among the things you'll earn for completing a battle\nare two important types of points: [System:Color name=tutorial ]WP [/System:Color]and [System:Color name=tutorial ]SP[/System:Color].
150	WP stands for [System:Color name=tutorial ]Weapon Points[/System:Color]. You can think of these\nas a measure of the [System:Color name=tutorial ]level of skill [/System:Color]that Rex has with his\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]weapon[/System:Color], and you'll need them to [System:Color name=tutorial ]level up Arts[/System:Color].
151	The same Art will deal much higher damage to enemies\nat higher levels, so it's worth strengthening your Arts\nat the earliest opportunity!
152	Give it a go by heading to [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Characters[/System:Color] >\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Character Setup [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Enhance Arts[/System:Color].
153	WP isn't the only thing you'll need to enhance your\nArts, however: each Art level also requires a certain\ncharacter level to unlock.
154	If Rex himself hasn't reached a high enough level,\nhe won't be able to enhance his Arts beyond that point.
155	By the way, the Enhance Arts menu also allows you\nto select which Art is assigned to which button.
156	SP, meanwhile, stands for [System:Color name=tutorial ]Skill Points[/System:Color]. These represent\nhow well Rex is [System:Color name=tutorial ]trained in his battle techniques[/System:Color],\nand they're used to unlock passive [System:Color name=tutorial ]skills[/System:Color].
157	Try giving Rex some new skills in [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu [/System:Color]>\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Characters [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Character Setup[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Affinity Chart[/System:Color].
158	Rex's ability to [System:Color name=tutorial ]resonate with Core Crystals [/System:Color]has been\nunlocked!
159	You can bond with a Blade at any time by going to\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blades[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Bond Blade[/System:Color].
160	There are three ranks of Core Crystal: [System:Color name=tutorial ]Common[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]Rare[/System:Color],\nand [System:Color name=tutorial ]Legendary[/System:Color].
161	The higher the rank, the higher the chance that\nresonating with the crystal will yield an unusual\nBlade.
162	Core Crystals aren't much use just lying around,\nso it can't hurt to resonate with them and see\nwhat you get!
163	Once you have yourself a new Blade,\nyou'll need to [System:Color name=tutorial ]engage it [/System:Color]so that it can\ntake part in battle.
164	Add Blades to your battle party in [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu [/System:Color]>\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Characters [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Character Setup [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Engage Blades[/System:Color].
165	Up until now, Rex has had to rely on Pyra alone\nfor support in battle...
166	...but now you'll be able to engage a variety of\nother Blades and expand your support options!
167	To take advantage of different Blades in battle,\npress the directional button corresponding to each\nBlade's face icon and perform a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Switch[/System:Color].
168	In no time at all, the Blade who was previously\nsupporting you will retreat, and the new Blade will\ntake their place on the battlefield!
169	Of course, switching Blades will change both your\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]weapon[/System:Color] and your [System:Color name=tutorial ]available Arts[/System:Color].
170	Different weapons have different benefits and\ndrawbacks in battle, so use Blade Switches tactically\nafter considering the current situation.
171	A word of warning: once you've performed a Blade\nSwitch, it'll be a little while before your previous\nBlade will be available for use again.
172	However, Rex can build [System:Color name=tutorial ]Trust [/System:Color]with his Blades.\nThe higher your Trust, the less time you'll have\nto wait to call for support from that Blade again!
173	[System:Color name=tutorial ]Getting a Blade's Affinity Rewards will increase\nTrust[/System:Color], so when you get a new Blade, remember\nto try and complete as many as possible!
174	Behold Poppi, Alrest's first artificial Blade! Since Poppi\nis man-made (or should that be...Nopon-made?), she\ncan't make use of [System:Color name=tutorial ]Aux Cores[/System:Color] like a regular Blade.
175	Behold Poppi, the world's first Artificial Blade! Poppi\ncan't equip Aux Cores, but she has something just as\ngood for customizing her abilities: [System:Color name=tutorial ]Poppiswap[/System:Color]!
176	You can access Poppiswap by going to [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu[/System:Color] >\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Characters[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Setup[/System:Color] ([System:Color name=tutorial ]Poppi α[/System:Color]) > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Poppiswap[/System:Color].
177	To make use of the Poppiswap feature, you'll need\nto get hold of certain items via the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Tiger! Tiger![/System:Color] game.
178	Play Tiger! Tiger! as much as you can to make\nPoppi into her best self!
179	Looks like you've got Nia back safe and sound!\nNow you've got three members in your party, I should\nexplain about [System:Color name=tutorial ]roles[/System:Color] and [System:Color name=tutorial ]classes[/System:Color].
180	Blades are born with a role: [System:Color name=tutorial ]Attackers [/System:Color]([System:Color name=tutorial ]ATK[/System:Color]), [System:Color name=tutorial ]Healers\n[/System:Color]([System:Color name=tutorial ]HLR[/System:Color]), and [System:Color name=tutorial ]Tanks[/System:Color] ([System:Color name=tutorial ]TNK[/System:Color]). For example, Pyra is an\nAttacker, and Dromarch is a Healer.
181	The types of Blade that a Driver engages will determine\ntheir fighting style. Each Driver's fighting style will fall\ninto certain categories, called [System:Color name=tutorial ]Classes[/System:Color].
182	Some Classes emphasize attack, some defense, or some\nstrike a balance between Roles, and each Class has its\nown [System:Color name=tutorial ]special effects[/System:Color].
183	It's up to you whether you just want to engage your\nfavorite Blades, or strategically select Blades to achieve\na certain Class. Do whatever's best for your play style!
184	Generally, Blades can't change Roles. As an Artificial\nBlade, [System:Color name=tutorial ]Poppi[/System:Color] is the exception. She can [System:Color name=tutorial ]change her Role[/System:Color]\nusing her [System:Color name=tutorial ]Poppiswap[/System:Color] feature.
185	Try your hand at [System:Color name=tutorial ]Tiger! Tiger![/System:Color] to try and get hold of the\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Role CPU[/System:Color]s that you'll need to change Poppi's Role in\nPoppiswap!
186	Different [System:Color name=tutorial ]classes [/System:Color]will impart certain [System:Color name=tutorial ]advantages[/System:Color] on\nDrivers, so experiment with different combinations of\nBlades to get the best effect!
187	Now if you've got all that, let's get back to\nthe game and make our escape!
188	It's time to let you in on a handy battle tactic...\nHow to [System:Color name=tutorial ]lure [/System:Color]enemies!
189	If you target an enemy from a distance [System:Color name=tutorial ]without\ndrawing your weapon[/System:Color] and [System:Color name=tutorial ]press [ML:icon icon=down ][/System:Color], you can lure\nan enemy toward you.
190	It's useful for taking out a herd of enemies one\nby one, or for when you'd prefer to fight an\nopponent in a wider space.
191	Try luring over that enemy in front of you now!\nFirst, target it with [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=R ][/System:Color], then press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=down ] [/System:Color]to lure it over!
192	You've arrived in [System:Color name=tutorial ]Torigoth[/System:Color], Gormott's largest\nsettlement! So now's a good time to talk about\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]developing towns[/System:Color].
193	Towns in Alrest are rated according to their level of\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]development[/System:Color]. This is called their [System:Color name=tutorial ]Development Level[/System:Color]\nor [System:Color name=tutorial ]Dev Level[/System:Color] for short.
194	A town's Development Level can be raised by earning\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Dev Points[/System:Color].
195	When a town's Dev Level goes up, then you can expect\nthe [System:Color name=tutorial ]price of goods in shops to go down[/System:Color]!
196	Some shops might even expand their ranges and sell\nnever-before-seen products.
197	You can [System:Color name=tutorial ]earn Dev Points [/System:Color]by [System:Color name=tutorial ]completing quests [/System:Color]and\nresolving residents' difficulties.
198	It's also possible to [System:Color name=tutorial ]earn a few Dev Points [/System:Color]just by\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]talking to people you meet[/System:Color].
199	You can view the Dev Level of a town any\ntime you go shopping, and also by going\nto [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Skip Travel[/System:Color].
200	As a public-spirited citizen of Alrest, you should do\nall you can to raise the Dev Level of its settlements!
201	The Titans of Alrest are surrounded by the Cloud Sea.\nAnd as Rex and his friends were just discussing, the\nCloud Sea has [System:Color name=tutorial ]tides[/System:Color] that come and go.
202	The shifting tides will close off places that you could\nonce visit, as well as opening up places that you \ncouldn't reach, so plan your adventure accordingly!
203	Hold on! I almost forgot to tell you about\nsomething really important - how to [System:Color name=tutorial ]develop\nyour Blade's capabilities[/System:Color]!
204	There are three main ways to develop a Blade:\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]weapon modification[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]equipping Aux Cores[/System:Color], and\nthe [System:Color name=tutorial ]Affinity Chart[/System:Color].
205	Weapon modification is exactly what it sounds like.\nA Blade's weapon is tied to them from the moment\nthey're awakened, so it can't just be replaced...
206	You can apply Core Chips to weapons in [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu[/System:Color] >\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Characters[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Setup[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Weapon Modification[/System:Color].
207	If you come across a shop selling Core Chips\nduring your adventure, it's always a good idea to\ninvest in some new ones!
208	It's rumored that certain Core Chips not only change\nthe basic stats of a weapon, but also activate new\nabilities, so keep an eye out for these effects too.
209	You might even come across enemies carrying special\nCore Chips during your travels.
210	However you obtain them, you can apply Core Chips\nto weapons by going to [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Characters [/System:Color]>\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Setup [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Weapon Modification[/System:Color].
211	Next, let's talk about the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Affinity Chart[/System:Color]. This is a chart\nwhich shows the range of proficiencies available to a\nspecific Blade.
212	Here's where you can acquire or enhance abilities like\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Arts[/System:Color], or [System:Color name=tutorial ]Field Skills[/System:Color]. Field Skills can be a great help in\nremoving obstacles from your path.
213	These abilities and power-ups can be had by fulfilling\nthe conditions for the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Affinity Rewards[/System:Color] on the Affinity\nChart. There's a whole host of goals for you to aim for.
214	Finally, we have [System:Color name=tutorial ]Aux Cores[/System:Color]. These are like accessories\nspecifically for Blades to equip.
215	You'll be sure to happen across Aux Cores from\ntime to time as you continue with your journey.
216	However, you won't be able to equip Aux Cores that\nyou find right away.
217	You'll need to have them [System:Color name=tutorial ]refined [/System:Color]at a [System:Color name=tutorial ]shop dealing\nin Aux Cores[/System:Color]. We can go over the details when you\nvisit one of these shops for yourself!
218	Before you head off on your big job,\nI'd like to explain a little something about\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]selling items[/System:Color] in Alrest.
219	You may have already made of use of them,\nbut there are businesses called item trading shops\nthat specialize in taking [System:Color name=tutorial ]treasure[/System:Color] off your hands.
220	If you sell off items as a whole set, you'll earn a bunch\nmore money than if you sold them off individually.
221	Well, item trading shops are a bit different.\nThey differ from normal shops in two ways: they\nonly buy in [System:Color name=tutorial ]bulk[/System:Color], and they [System:Color name=tutorial ]specialise in treasure[/System:Color].
222	For example, if you take some treasure you've\nsalvaged to a regular shop, then they might only\npay you 20G for it.
223	But if you took the same items to a trading shop,\nthey might buy a set of three from you for 100G.
224	The key thing to keep in mind with item traders is that\nthey're very selective about the wares they accept.\nThey'll only buy your items in predefined sets.
225	But if you can find the stuff they're after, it'll fetch\nbetter prices than you can get elsewhere. They might\neven throw in some item rewards to sweeten the deal!
226	So when you find precious treasures, don't just sell\nthem off cheap at a regular shop. See if you can put\ntogether sets for trading shops and make a tidy profit!
227	Since you're standing in front of an [System:Color name=tutorial ]Aux Core shop[/System:Color],\nlet's revisit the topic of Aux Cores for a moment.\nAt shops like these, you can [System:Color name=tutorial ]get your Aux Cores refined[/System:Color].
228	You'll need [System:Color name=tutorial ]collectible items [/System:Color]to refine Aux Cores.
229	The number of collectible items you'll need is\ndefined individually for each Aux Core.
230	Once you have all the collectibles you need, you\ncan head to the shop to get your Aux Core refined.
231	But watch out! The higher the value of the\nAux Core, the more difficult it's likely to be\nto find all of the necessary items.
232	If you want to be able to refine your Aux Cores\nas soon as you get them, you'll need to always be\non the lookout for Collection Points on your travels!
233	Ah, it looks like you've found a treasure trove!\nBut as you may have noticed, it's a little different\nfrom the regular kind.
234	The icon above the box indicates that you'll need\nthe help of your Blades' [System:Color name=tutorial ]Field Skills [/System:Color]to open it.
235	But even if you can't open a treasure trove\nright away, there's no need to despair!
236	If you develop your Blades and help them to acquire\nField Skills from the Affinity Chart, someday you'll\nsurely be able to open it up and see what's inside.
237	You now have the option to take [System:Color name=tutorial ]long rests[/System:Color] at\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]lodging facilities[/System:Color]. This lets you rest until the\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]tides of the Cloud Sea[/System:Color] have shifted.
238	If you ever find that your way is blocked due to the\nshifting tides of the Cloud Sea, then just go back and\nhave a long rest, whether you're tired or not.
239	Since the tides of the Cloud Sea change every time you\nhave a long rest, it's wise to check the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Cloud Sea status[/System:Color]\nin the [System:Color name=tutorial ]environmental information[/System:Color] display first.
240	Oh, and you should bear in mind that it's not\npossible to take a long rest at every single\nlodging facility in Alrest.
241	But you certainly can in the one in Torigoth, which is\njust as well, because Torigoth is quite sensitive to the\ncomings and goings of the Cloud Sea!
242	Looks like you've become the leader of the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Garfont\nMercenaries[/System:Color]. Congratulations! Let's take a moment\nto go over what Yew just told us.
243	Mercs can expect to field requests for all kinds of\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]missions[/System:Color].
244	Usually, you'll get a notification on the right of the\nscreen when a new Merc Mission becomes available,\nbut you can also check them in the menu.
245	Additionally, if you run into someone who looks like\nthey're having some kind of problem, you might be able\nto accept a mission from them directly.
246	Just bear in mind that there are two types of Merc\nMission: missions that can [System:Color name=tutorial ]only be done once[/System:Color], and\nmissions you can do [System:Color name=tutorial ]over and over again[/System:Color].
247	The next point is about the importance of making sure\nthat you [System:Color name=tutorial ]build the right team for the job[/System:Color]. For each\nmission, you'll need to put together a squad of Blades.
248	If you look carefully at the job details, you should be\nable to figure out [System:Color name=tutorial ]which skills you'll need the Blades\nyou send to have[/System:Color].
249	If you send a squad with the right skills, then you'll\ngreatly reduce the amount of time it takes to complete\nthe mission.
250	Blades can [System:Color name=tutorial ]get achievements in the Affinity Chart[/System:Color] if\nthey're part of squad that [System:Color name=tutorial ]fulfills a Merc Mission[/System:Color].
251	So, even while they aren't accompanying you on your\nadventure, if you keep them busy with Merc Missions,\nthey can come back stronger than ever!
252	By the way, your mercenary band has a [System:Color name=tutorial ]rank[/System:Color] of its own,\nwhich can be raised by completing certain missions.
253	When you think the band might be ready to\nsize up to the next level, go and talk to Yew -\nI'm sure he'll point you in the right direction.
254	Raising your Merc Group's rank allows you to take\non more challenging missions, so it's worth doing.
255	Also, if you raise the development level of a settlement,\nthen you'll be able to take on special missions which\nwill increase the range of products available in shops.
256	So, to summarize: First you [System:Color name=tutorial ]accept a mission[/System:Color], then\nyou [System:Color name=tutorial ]get your squad together under your Blade[/System:Color].
257	Then you [System:Color name=tutorial ]fulfill the mission[/System:Color]. And finally, you [System:Color name=tutorial ]reap the\nrewards[/System:Color]!
258	Best of luck! I'm sure you'll be a great Merc leader!
259	See that icon floating over there?\nIt indicates the location of a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Heart-to-Heart talk[/System:Color].
260	Heart-to-Hearts are important events that let your\nparty members grow closer together as friends.
261	You'll run into these icons all over Alrest,\nso it's a good idea to check them out as you\nencounter them!
262	Viewing Heart-to-Hearts is sure to give a\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]big boost[/System:Color] to the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Trust Level[/System:Color] between your\nDrivers and Blades!
263	Think carefully before answering any options that are\npresented to you during the Heart-to-Heart, as your\nresponses will affect the amount of Trust gained.
264	To view a Heart-to-Heart, you'll need to have the right\npeople present in your party, at the right time of day.\nYou can view the conditions by accessing the icon.
265	Sometimes you'll find the icon does nothing\nunless you access it with the right party members\nor at the right time of day.
266	It's also worth keeping in mind that viewing some\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Heart-to-Hearts [/System:Color]counts as an [System:Color name=tutorial ]achievement [/System:Color]on a\nBlade's Affinity Chart.
267	So Heart-to-Hearts are an invaluable tool if you're\nlooking to develop your Blades' abilities!
268	One more thing... You can often find out the location of\nHeart-to-Hearts after resting at lodgings such as inns.
269	The more Heart-to-Hearts you view, the bond of Trust\nand Affinity between you and your Blade will deepen!
270	So you might need a quick primer on\nhow a Driver fights!
271	The first thing you need to know about is [System:Color name=tutorial ]Affinity[/System:Color].\nSee that [System:Color name=tutorial ]bond of light [/System:Color]connecting Rex and Pyra?\nThis represents the Affinity that exists between them.
272	When a Driver and Blade's hearts are truly in sync,\nthis bond will start to glow with a [System:Color name=tutorial ]golden light[/System:Color].
273	When Affinity glows golden, it's a sign that the minds of\nBlade and Driver are in harmony. [System:Color name=tutorial ]Movement speed[/System:Color] will\ngo up, and [System:Color name=tutorial ]recharging Arts[/System:Color] will speed up.
274	It'll even provide some serious boosts to his\nbasic attack power.
275	You can strengthen Affinity in battle by staying\nphysically close to your Blade and hitting home with\nas many attacks as possible.
276	But other factors can also have an effect,\nsuch as battling skillfully by dealing a lot of\nattacks in succession.
277	On the other hand, if there's too much distance, Affinity\nweakens, which will weaken the Driver in turn. Keep\nRex's Affinity with Pyra in mind when fighting Malos!
278	Rex is in trouble if this happens - his\nfighting strength will start to dissipate.
279	Now it's time to get back to fighting Malos.\nTry to keep your Affinity in mind!
280	[System:Color name=tutorial ]Specials [/System:Color]are among the most powerful attacks in\na Driver's arsenal, far outclassing ordinary Arts.
281	Even after your Special is ready, you can [System:Color name=tutorial ]keep\ncharging its gauge[/System:Color] to increase its level and power.
282	Specials are [System:Color name=tutorial ]charged up[/System:Color] by attacking with Arts.
283	You can charge Specials to [System:Color name=tutorial ]three levels of power[/System:Color].
284	If you [System:Color name=tutorial ]use an Art at the precise moment that an auto-\nattack hits home, you'll charge up Specials more than\nusual[/System:Color]. When you do this, you'll see a success indicator.
285	Also, when you use a Special, you'll need to\nexecute a [System:Color name=tutorial ]button challenge[/System:Color].
286	Follow the prompts on screen and [System:Color name=tutorial ]hit the buttons at\njust the right time[/System:Color] to multiply the damage dealt.
287	Attacking the enemy with a Special may even give you\na chance to perform a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Combo[/System:Color]...but I'll tell\nyou more about that another time.
288	After you assault an enemy with a Special, you'll see a\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]gauge [/System:Color]at the top of the screen indicating the [System:Color name=tutorial ]window\nof opportunity[/System:Color] in which you can use a Blade Combo.
289	The [System:Color name=tutorial ]possible Routes [/System:Color]for the Blade Combo\nwill also be displayed on screen.
290	If you can hit the enemy with another, higher-staged\nSpecial before the gauge [System:Color name=tutorial ]runs out[/System:Color], you'll deal [System:Color name=tutorial ]much\nmore damage [/System:Color]than a regular Special.
291	The enemy's just been hit with a Special. I'll bump up\nyour Special level for you just this once, so try to catch\nthem with a Blade Combo!
292	[System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Arts [/System:Color]are one of the tools in a Blade's arsenal,\nand Blades will use them [System:Color name=tutorial ]automatically during battle\nto support their Driver[/System:Color].
293	The better the Trust between Driver and Blade,\nthe more support the Driver will receive.
294	As for Trust...that's a topic for later.\nWe can go into the details when you've gained\na bit more experience as a Driver.
295	Right now, you should probably\nfocus on defeating Malos.
296	Now we've got ourselves a decent sized party,\nit's worth knowing how to deal with [System:Color name=tutorial ]aggro[/System:Color].
297	I daresay you've already noticed, but while a\nDriver is being attacked by an enemy, they'll\nbe marked with a [System:Color name=tutorial ]red ring[/System:Color].
298	We call this the "[System:Color name=tutorial ]Aggro Marker[/System:Color]". The [System:Color name=tutorial ]wedges[/System:Color] on the\nmarker point to the targeting enemy or enemies,\nshowing [System:Color name=tutorial ]the direction you're being attacked from[/System:Color].
299	Aggro is a measure of an enemy's aggression toward\nthe Drivers they're fighting. The more viciously you\nattack an enemy, the more it'll want to attack you back.
300	Drawing aggro is dangerous for Healers. Since they\nhave low HP, they're more likely to be incapicated by\nattacks. Make sure to keep Nia's aggro low!
301	Drivers that have defense-orientated Classes are better\nequipped to draw aggro and absorb enemy attacks. So,\nright now, it's better for Tora to have the most aggro.
302	Drivers with Fighter-type Classes are the ones that\nfocus on dealing damage to the enemy. That's Rex, so\nmake him the mainstay of your offense!
303	Here's the cheat sheet: Defenders take the hit, Healers\nheal Defenders, and Fighters hurt the enemy.
304	Take a look at the indicators the arrow is pointing to.\nThese show the various [System:Color name=tutorial ]sealing effects[/System:Color] that can be\napplied if you execute a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Stage 3 Blade Combo[/System:Color].
305	The final Special you use in the Blade Combo\nwill determine which sealing effect is inflicted,\ndepending on the combo route.
306	Once inflicted, a sealing effect will continue\nuntil it gets [System:Color name=tutorial ]overwritten by another seal[/System:Color].
307	Regardless of type, sealing your enemy puts at you at\na massive advantage, so you should go all out to try\nand hit home with a Stage 3 Blade Combo!
308	However, there is one drawback to be aware of:\nwhen you hit an enemy with a Stage 3 Blade Combo,\nthey'll acquire a [System:Color name=tutorial ]resistance[/System:Color] to that Combo's element.
309	This means that using the same combo route\nrepeatedly will deal much less damage.
310	So when you use Blade Combos, you should experiment\nwith different routes!
311	The world of Alrest still contains many zoological\nenigmas, just waiting to be solved.
312	If you try targeting all sorts of enemies, you'll\noccasionally encounter ones whose [System:Color name=tutorial ]target icon\nlooks different from that of normal enemies[/System:Color].
313	We call those [System:Color name=tutorial ]unique monsters[/System:Color], and they're\na little bit special.
314	Unique monsters are much tougher than the\nregular kind. Even the strongest Drivers in Alrest\noften have trouble with them.
315	So if you take down a unique monster, you'll surely\nearn the respect of people all over Alrest!
316	That said, they're not a challenge for the faint-hearted.\nYou'll want to make sure you're prepared if you plan on\nsurviving the powerful attacks they often wield.
317	If you defeat a unique monster, a tombstone will remain\nat the site where it fell, in memory of its legendary life.
318	Some even say that if you press [ML:icon icon=A ] at the\ntombstone, the monster will rise from its grave\nto reclaim its former glory!
319	Rex is a Driver of the Aegis! The power of the\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Master Driver[/System:Color] has awoken within him!
320	Nia has unleashed her true power!\nNow Rex can [System:Color name=tutorial ]engage Nia as a Blade[/System:Color].
321	You can now summon Mythra or Pyra depending on\nRex's requirements.
322	The icon that the arrow is pointing to right now\nindicates the enemy's [System:Color name=tutorial ]weakness[/System:Color].
323	Since it's a [System:Color name=tutorial ]fire icon[/System:Color], this enemy is [System:Color name=tutorial ]weak against fire[/System:Color].\nSo Pyra's got something of an advantage here!
324	Next, let's talk about how to get party members [System:Color name=tutorial ]back\non their feet[/System:Color]. When a Driver's HP hits zero, they'll be\nincapacitated.
325	As long as you have at least one section filled in the\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Party Gauge[/System:Color], you can move over to an incapacitated\nparty member and press [ML:icon icon=A ] to revive them.
326	Even if you're incapacitated yourself, your party\nmembers can come and revive you in the same way.\nYou just need enough charge in the Party Gauge!
327	I also need to tell you about [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Combos[/System:Color]...\nBut to do that, first we'll need to launch a Special.\nI'll fill up your Special Gauge this time, so fire away!
328	However, just using Anchor Shot on its own\nwon't generally be enough to Topple the enemy.
329	To inflict Topple, you'll first need to destabilize\nthe enemy's stance with a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Break[/System:Color] effect.
330	[System:Color name=tutorial ]Nia[/System:Color] has an Art that can inflict [System:Color name=tutorial ]Break[/System:Color] on the enemy,\nso for maximum effect, wait for her to set you up\nbefore unleashing Anchor Shot!
331	See the gauge the arrow is pointing at?\nThis is the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Driver Combo gauge[/System:Color], and it will appear\nwhenever someone inflicts [System:Color name=tutorial ]Break[/System:Color] on the enemy.
332	Use an Art that has a Topple effect before that gauge\nruns out, and you'll have the opportunity to inflict\nmajor damage. This is what we call a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Driver Combo[/System:Color].
333	A Driver Combo can be extended through\nup to four stages in total:\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Break[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Topple[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Launch[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Smash[/System:Color].
334	You'll find Rex and his friends have a variety of Arts\nthat can be integrated into a Driver Combo, so try\nto find the best ways to link them all together!
335	For now, though, why don't you take advantage\nof Nia's [System:Color name=tutorial ]Break[/System:Color] effect and [System:Color name=tutorial ]Topple[/System:Color] that Ardun with\nyour [System:Color name=tutorial ]Anchor Shot[/System:Color]?
336	Perhaps you've made use of it already, but that thing\nthat the arrow is currently pointing to is called the\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]concentration icon[/System:Color].
337	When you're taking on multiple enemies, even if you\nswitch the leader's target, your allies won't switch\ntheirs. They'll carry on attacking the same enemies.
338	If you feel like you need some help, just press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=left ][/System:Color],\nthe button for the concentration icon, and your allies\nwill all hone in on the same enemy as you.
339	In a crowded battle, the order you choose to\ntake down enemies in can mean the difference\nbetween victory and utter failure.
340	Make good use of [System:Color name=tutorial ]target-switching[/System:Color] and have your\nallies [System:Color name=tutorial ]concentrate[/System:Color] on enemies, and you might find a\nway out of some sticky situations. Now, protect Pyra!
341	This means that Rex can [System:Color name=tutorial ]freely engage[/System:Color] Blades that\noriginally resonated with other Drivers.
342	You're engaging Brighid right now, so you'd better live\nup to the exacting standards set by Mòrag! Make sure\nto use Brighid's capabilities to their fullest extent.
343	Naturally, Nia can still maintain her [System:Color name=tutorial ]Driver form[/System:Color] while\ntraveling.
344	When you want to engage Nia as a Blade, go to\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Characters[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]then select the Driver Nia\nand press [ML:icon icon=Y ][/System:Color].
345	When you want to travel with Nia in her Driver form, go\nto [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Characters[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]then select the Blade Nia and\npress [ML:icon icon=Y ][/System:Color].
346	To switch them outside of battle, go to [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu[/System:Color] >\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Characters[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Pyra[/System:Color] ([System:Color name=tutorial ]Mythra[/System:Color]) and [System:Color name=tutorial ]press [ML:icon icon=Y ][/System:Color].\n
347	During battle, you can switch between them by\npressing the button assigned to [System:Color name=tutorial ]Pyra and Mythra's\nBlade Switch icon[/System:Color].
348	Unlike with a regular [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Switch[/System:Color], there's no\ncooldown timer for changing between Pyra and Mythra,\nso feel free to switch it up whenever!
349	The indicator the arrow is pointing at right now\nrepresents a [System:Color name=tutorial ]combo request[/System:Color] from a Blade currently\nengaged by the [System:Color name=tutorial ]character you're controlling[/System:Color].
350	This is displayed when one of your currently\nengaged Blades' Specials would be able to\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]initiate a Blade Combo[/System:Color]...
351	...and also when one of those Blades' Specials\nwould be able to [System:Color name=tutorial ]extend a Blade Combo that's\ncurrently in progress[/System:Color].
352	Blade Combos can have a massive impact on the\nbattlefield, so try not to miss these opportunities!
353	First, let's take a look at the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Party Gauge[/System:Color].\nWe may have touched on this before, but it has more\nuses than just getting your allies back on their feet!
354	When all three sections of the Party Gauge\nare fully charged, you're ready to launch a\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Chain Attack [/System:Color]by pressing [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=plus ][/System:Color].
355	During a Chain Attack, each of your party members\nin turn can choose one of their [System:Color name=tutorial ]currently engaged\nBlades[/System:Color] to perform a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Special[/System:Color] with.
356	For example, first Rex might choose to use a Special\nwith Pyra, then Nia might choose Dromarch, and\nfinally Tora can use one with Poppi.
357	Once everyone's had a turn, that's a single [System:Color name=tutorial ]round[/System:Color].
358	What's more, during a Chain Attack, you have the\nopportunity to [System:Color name=tutorial ]destroy[/System:Color] the unhelpful [System:Color name=tutorial ]element orbs[/System:Color]\nthat attach to your enemies when using Specials.
359	If you use a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Special with an opposing element[/System:Color] against\nan element orb, it'll be easier to smash, and you'll do\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]massive damage[/System:Color] if it does smash.
360	So think carefully about the order in which you\nsummon your Blades, and which Specials you use.
361	Attacking with Blades that [System:Color name=tutorial ]don't have the\nopposing element[/System:Color], meanwhile, will deal just\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]one point of damage[/System:Color] to a [System:Color name=tutorial ]random orb[/System:Color].
362	Performing a Special will incur cooldown for that\nBlade, but if you manage to [System:Color name=tutorial ]burst[/System:Color] an [System:Color name=tutorial ]element orb[/System:Color],\nyou'll [System:Color name=tutorial ]recover half of their cooldown[/System:Color].
363	If you manage to burst an element orb during a round,\nthen you'll be able to [System:Color name=tutorial ]extend that Chain Attack's\nround length[/System:Color].
364	Bursting a lot of element orbs can have a [System:Color name=tutorial ]massive\nimpact[/System:Color] on the [System:Color name=tutorial ]damage multiplier[/System:Color] applied at the\nend of the Chain Attack.
365	When the round is extended, you'll have to execute\na [System:Color name=tutorial ]button challenge[/System:Color]. If you [System:Color name=tutorial ]succeed[/System:Color], this will also\nrecover some of the Blades' [System:Color name=tutorial ]cooldown[/System:Color].
366	This button challenge is important for another reason.\nUsually, when selecting a Blade to perform a Special,\ntheir [System:Color name=tutorial ]Lv 1 Special[/System:Color] will be used...
367	...but [System:Color name=tutorial ]succeeding[/System:Color] in button challenges will [System:Color name=tutorial ]raise the\nlevel[/System:Color] of the Special to a [System:Color name=tutorial ]maximum of three[/System:Color].
368	However, be careful, because if you [System:Color name=tutorial ]fail[/System:Color] a button\nchallenge, then the [System:Color name=tutorial ]level[/System:Color] of the Special will [System:Color name=tutorial ]go down\nby one level[/System:Color].
369	Finally, it's worth remembering that launching a\nChain Attack will [System:Color name=tutorial ]use up your entire Party Gauge[/System:Color],\nso be sure to save it for the right moment.
370	While the Chain Attack is active, though, enemies\nwon't attack at all. This gives you a bit of time to\nfigure out how best to burst those element orbs!
371	If you get all the way to [System:Color name=tutorial ]max Affinity[/System:Color], the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Trust\nlevel [/System:Color]between Blade and Driver will increase.
372	Increasing Trust has plenty of advantages of its own,\nbut that explanation can wait for another time.
373	Right, it's time for your first big hike to Torigoth!\nAround this point, you'll want to start paying attention\nto the level of [System:Color name=tutorial ]Trust[/System:Color] between Blade and Driver.
374	Trust is a vital resource that you need to [System:Color name=tutorial ]unlock\nlevels[/System:Color] on your Blade's [System:Color name=tutorial ]Affinity Chart[/System:Color].
375	So if you want to maximize the support that you get\nfrom your Blade, you need to make winning their\nTrust a priority.
376	There a few different ways to increase [System:Color name=tutorial ]Trust[/System:Color].\nOne way is to [System:Color name=tutorial ]complete quests[/System:Color].
377	When you complete a quest, you'll build Trust with\nwhichever Blade you're with.
378	Trust goes up when you achieve maximum Affinity in\nbattle as well. Affinity bonds will shine with a golden\ncolor when they're at their height.
379	Another way to boost Trust is to keep your Affinity\nat [System:Color name=tutorial ]maximum level[/System:Color] during battles.
380	I mentioned it a while back when you were fighting\nMalos, but keeping [System:Color name=tutorial ]Affinity[/System:Color] high is quite an important\nfactor in building Trust, so try to keep it in mind.
381	There are a few more ways to gain Trust, but I don't\nwant to overload you with information all at once, so\nlook out for a few more handy tips down the line!
382	Right now, I'd say it's about time\nwe set off for [System:Color name=tutorial ]Torigoth[/System:Color].
383	It's also possible to [System:Color name=tutorial ]raise[/System:Color] [System:Color name=tutorial ]Trust[/System:Color] between Blade and\nDriver by viewing [System:Color name=tutorial ]Heart-to-Hearts[/System:Color]. This is the third\nmethod for building Trust.
384	Completing Merc Missions is also one way to [System:Color name=tutorial ]boost\nTrust[/System:Color] between Driver and Blade. That's the fourth\nway of raising Trust, if you're counting!
385	Need a quick reminder? You'll build Trust when you:\n1. [System:Color name=tutorial ]Complete quests.[/System:Color]\n2. [System:Color name=tutorial ]Maintain maximum Affinity during battle.[/System:Color]
386	3.[System:Color name=tutorial ] View Heart-to-Hearts.\n[/System:Color]4. [System:Color name=tutorial ]Complete Merc Missions.[/System:Color]\nAll seems pretty straightforward, right?
387	Level 4 Specials are more...special than the Specials\nyou're used to. You can't charge them up by using Arts.
388	How do you use them, then?\nWell, you just need to [System:Color name=tutorial ]stay physically\nclose to your Blade[/System:Color].
389	If you stay close to your Blade, your\nLevel 4 Special gauge will increase.
390	When the gauge is full, activating the Special\nwill make Driver and Blade unite in body and\nsoul to deliver a truly spectacular attack!
391	Anyway, that got a little long-winded, so I think\nit's best to let you learn by doing.
392	I've maxed out your Party Gauge for you,\nso why don't you try hitting the [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=plus ] Button[/System:Color] and\ntrying a Chain Attack for yourself?
393	When ascended, Pyra's attacks have unprecedented\npower. What's more, during Blade Combos, you can\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]select the combo route regardless of the next element[/System:Color].
394	Choosing your combo route is simple - just\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]use [ML:icon icon=up ][ML:icon icon=down ][/System:Color] to switch between the different options.
395	In normal battles, you can acheive Pyra's ascended\nstate when both Pyra or Mythra's Affinity and the\nParty Gauge are at maximum level.
396	When you've fulfilled both of these conditions,[System:Color name=tutorial ] press [ML:icon icon=X ]\nwhile holding down [ML:icon icon=R ][/System:Color] to trigger the transformation.
397	When Pyra launches a Blade Combo in her ascended \nstate, her power to make whatever she imagines real\nlets her [System:Color name=tutorial ]choose any combo route [/System:Color]to trigger.
398	To select a combo route, press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=up ] or [ML:icon icon=down ][/System:Color] when a combo\nrequest comes through.
399	Pyra is incredibly powerful in her ascended state, but\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]she can only sustain it for a limited time[/System:Color]. Keep an eye\non the gauge, as it indicates how long the state will last.
400	But you don't need to worry about that right now.\nThere's no time limit in this particular battle,\nso feel free to go to town with Pyra's true power!
401	If you've got [System:Color name=tutorial ]Pyra and Nia engaged[/System:Color] to Rex at the same\ntime, [System:Color name=tutorial ]max out his Affinity with them both[/System:Color], and then use\na [System:Color name=tutorial ]level 4 Special[/System:Color]...
402	It'll come out as a coordinated three-person attack\nthat you could simply never get with other Blades!
403	Its destructive power is also a cut above regular\nSpecials, so if you've got Pyra and Nia engaged,\nbe sure to use it to its fullest!
404	Perhaps it's a little too soon to tell you about\nAux Cores though. I'll save the details for when you've\nactually got hold of one.
405	Have you been shopping yet? If you make it to a new\ntown, be sure to check out what the local merchants\nhave to offer!
406	There's a good chance they'll have a few new products\nthat were previously unavailable to you!
407	Aux Cores can be equipped to Blades in [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu[/System:Color] >\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Characters[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Setup[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Equip Aux Cores[/System:Color].
408	You might even want to use Skip Travel to head\nback to Argentum and see how the goods here\ncompare to the ones there.
409	It's time for me to tell you about [System:Color name=tutorial ]cancel attacks[/System:Color]!
410	If you [System:Color name=tutorial ]execute an Art[/System:Color] at the precise moment that\nan [System:Color name=tutorial ]auto-attack[/System:Color] connects, a [System:Color name=tutorial ]ring of light[/System:Color] will appear\naround you.
411	This ring of light tells you that your cancel attack has\nbeen successful.
412	A successful cancel attack will be more effective than\nan Art executed normally.
413	Also, the recharge gauge will fill up faster afterwards,\nso you can really get an advantage from using cancel\nattacks.
414	The effect of the cancel attack will increase with\nthe stage of the auto-attack, so try to execute it on\nthe third blow to get the most bang for your buck!
415	Well, now you know about aggro, and Driver Class.\nThat's two things to keep in mind while you're giving\nDughall what-for!
416	When this happens, [System:Color name=tutorial ]an orb signaling that resistance[/System:Color]\nwill appear around the enemy. These are called\nelement orbs.
417	Attack the enemy with the same element as the orb,\nand you'll do greatly reduced damage.
418	A word of warning, here. The pink icon [System:Color name=tutorial ]will not appear[/System:Color]\non the compass at the top of the screen [System:Color name=tutorial ]unless you\nset a quest as active[/System:Color].
419	Feel free to ignore this feature if you're a seasoned\nveteran, but rookie adventurers would do well to\nremember to set active quests whenever possible!
420	And, just in case you ever find yourself struggling with\nthe basic controls...
421	Press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=left ][/System:Color],[System:Color name=tutorial ] [ML:icon icon=up ] [/System:Color]or[System:Color name=tutorial ] [ML:icon icon=right ][/System:Color] to bring up a quick explanation of\nthe control scheme.
422	[System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=left ][/System:Color] is for battle controls,\n[System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=up ][/System:Color] is for the camera controls, and\n[System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=right ][/System:Color] is for field controls.
423	You can check the status of the Cloud Sea's tides\nby looking at the [System:Color name=tutorial ]environmental information[/System:Color] indicator.
424	Take a look at the newly-added icon in the top right\ncorner. If the Cloud Sea's level is shown [System:Color name=tutorial ]above the\nmedian line[/System:Color], it means the clouds are at [System:Color name=tutorial ]high tide[/System:Color].
425	Conversely, if it's [System:Color name=tutorial ]below the median line[/System:Color], it means\nthe clouds are currently at [System:Color name=tutorial ]low tide[/System:Color].
426	Well now! It seems Pyra will be taking a much-deserved\nbreak for the next while and a half, so now's your\nchance to work more closely with [System:Color name=tutorial ]Mythra[/System:Color].
427	Mythra wields powers that overshadow Pyra's, with\nher [System:Color name=tutorial ]level 4 Special[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]Sacred Arrow[/System:Color], calling down shafts\nof destructive light from the sky above.
428	What that means though is that [System:Color name=tutorial ]its use would be limited[/System:Color]\nin places where [System:Color name=tutorial ]the sky is obstructed[/System:Color]; for example, by\na roof. Make sure to plan accordingly!
429	Let me take this chance to bend your ear quickly about\nDriver stats. Every Driver has a few basic ones, namely\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]HP[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]Strength[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]Ether[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]Dexterity[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]Agility[/System:Color] and [System:Color name=tutorial ]Luck[/System:Color].
430	[System:Color name=tutorial ]HP[/System:Color]: the Driver's health; they'll fall if it drops to 0.\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Strength[/System:Color]: affects damage from physical Arts.\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Ether[/System:Color]: affects damage/healing from Ether Arts.
431	[System:Color name=tutorial ]Dexterity[/System:Color]: affects attack accuracy.\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Agility[/System:Color]: affects chance to evade enemy attacks.\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Luck[/System:Color]: makes it easier to resist enemy debuffs/reactions.
432	Also, the higher a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Driver's luck stat value[/System:Color], the better\ntheir chances of awakening certain very special Blades.
433	Earlier I told you that you'll need to hit home with a\nlevel 3 Blade Combo to add an element orb. But this\ntime, let's just add a Water orb to Akhos for free.
434	I'll drop you a little hint so that you can smash the orb\neffectively: [System:Color name=tutorial ]You're better off striking with a Special that\nhas the opposite element[/System:Color], which in this case, is [System:Color name=tutorial ]Fire[/System:Color].
435	The [System:Color name=tutorial ]Merc Group menu[/System:Color] is now open! Access it from\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Merc Group[/System:Color].
436	Then, when you next start a Chain Attack, the\nParty Gauge will be replaced with the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Full Burst Gauge[/System:Color].
437	The Full Burst Gauge will fill up a little each time you\nsmash an element orb, and when it's full, a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Full Burst[/System:Color]\nwill initiate.
438	And, as you might have guessed, when a Full Burst\ninitiates, your enemies will be on the wrong end of\nmassive damage!
439	You can take a look at Affinity Rewards here:\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Characters[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Setup[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Affinity Chart[/System:Color].
440	A branching quest has begun! As the name\nsuggests, this is a quest that can be cleared\nin more than one way.
441	First up, we need to check the footprints. If you've\nresonated with a Blade that has the right skill for the\njob, then you'll get through this quest easily.
442	But, if you don't have a Blade like that in your arsenal,\nthen you should speak to Otto. He'll give you a hint\ntowards another way to your goal.
443	If you try to fight Infernal Guldo in the usual way,\nyou're going to struggle to take him down.
444	You'll have a much easier time of it if you activate\nPyra/Mythra's ascended state.
445	Just this once, I'll fill up the Party Gauge and the\ncooldown timer for you so that you can achieve the\nascension and fight to your best advantage.
446	[System:Color name=tutorial ]When the Party Gauge is at maximum capacity[/System:Color],\nunleash Pyra/Mythra's ascended state by [System:Color name=tutorial ]pressing [ML:icon icon=X ]\nwhile holding down [ML:icon icon=R ][/System:Color].
447	While playing [System:Color name=tutorial ]New Game Plus[/System:Color], you'll be able to\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]lower your Drivers' levels[/System:Color] as well as raise them\nwhenever you rest at an inn.
448	The EXP difference from lowering a level will be added\nto the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Bonus EXP[/System:Color] pool. You can talk to [System:Color name=tutorial ]traveling bards[/System:Color]\nto [System:Color name=tutorial ]exchange Bonus EXP for valuable items[/System:Color].
449	The [System:Color name=tutorial ]traveling bards[/System:Color]' locations will be marked on the\nmini-map with a [System:Color name=tutorial ]green shop icon[/System:Color].
450	If you currently have shop icons hidden, you can\nchange this setting on the Skip Travel screen.
451	You can now engage the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Poppibuster [/System:Color]as a Blade!\nCurrently, he's engaged on Rex.
452	However, you can engage the Poppibuster\nto any Driver (except Tora) at any time\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]without having to spend an Overdrive Protocol[/System:Color].
453	To do so, simply select him on the right Driver's\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Engage Blades screen[/System:Color].
454	Feel free to use the new-built power of the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Poppibuster[/System:Color]\nin whatever way best suits your battle needs!
455	You can now engage [System:Color name=tutorial ]Shulk [/System:Color]and [System:Color name=tutorial ]Fiora[/System:Color] as Blades!
456	For starters, Shulk is engaged on [System:Color name=tutorial ]Rex[/System:Color],\nand Fiora on [System:Color name=tutorial ]Nia[/System:Color].
457	But from now on, you'll be able to engage them to\nany Driver (except Tora) [System:Color name=tutorial ]without having to use an\nOverdrive Protocol[/System:Color].
458	To do so, simply select them on your chosen Driver's\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Engage Blades screen[/System:Color]. Feel free to experiment with\nShulk and Fiora to see how they fit your battle plans!
459	However, you won't be able to take them with you\nwhen you leave the Land of Challenge.
460	When you travel through the portal to [System:Color name=tutorial ]return to Alrest[/System:Color],\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Shulk and Fiora will be removed from the party[/System:Color], so be\nsure to factor that in when planning your journey.
461	Rumor has it that among the various rewards that the\nNopon Archsage gives out for his Challenge Battles is\nan item that will let Shulk and Fiora enter Alrest...
462	If that sounds good to you, then by all means,\nbe sure to tackle those challenges as they come up!
463	Congratulations! You can now bring [System:Color name=tutorial ]Shulk [/System:Color]and [System:Color name=tutorial ]Fiora[/System:Color]\nwith you when you return to Alrest.
464	I'm sure your new friends will enjoy wielding their\nnewfound powers in this brave new world, too!
465	A Note About Challenge Battles
466	Until you progress through the game's story to the\npoint when you can travel to Olethro Ruins, the portal\nto the Land of Challenge will be placed in Argentum.
467	Please be advised that after the portal opens in\nOlethro Ruins, the one in Argentum will disappear.
468	All right! It's time to get stuck into Challenge Battles!\nThe challenge begins the moment you see\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]START!!![/System:Color] appear on the screen.
469	But first, let me explain the new screen elements.
470	The arrow is indicating the challenge's [System:Color name=tutorial ]elapsed time[/System:Color].\nTry to clear the challenge [System:Color name=tutorial ]before the time limit is\nexceeded[/System:Color].
471	The time allotted differs per Challenge Battle,\nso keep your eyes on the clock!
472	And now the arrow's pointing to the number of\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Ether Cubes you've collected[/System:Color].
473	The more Ether Cubes you collect, the more these\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]boxes [/System:Color]will fill up.
474	The number of filled-up [System:Color name=tutorial ]boxes[/System:Color] will affect which\ntreasure you receive after the battle.
475	See that orange cube the enemy dropped just now?\nThat's what we call an [System:Color name=tutorial ]Ether Cube[/System:Color].
476	Ether Cubes disappear after a short time. Try to grab\nas many as you can while you're fighting.
477	You lost the challenge! You will lose a challenge if [System:Color name=tutorial ]you\nfail in battle[/System:Color], or if you [System:Color name=tutorial ]exceed the time limit[/System:Color].
478	You can also quit a Challenge Battle partway through\nby [System:Color name=tutorial ]sheathing your weapon, then pressing [ML:icon icon=plus ][/System:Color].\nNeedless to say, a battle you quit counts as a failure.
479	You successfully completed the challenge!
480	After you complete a challenge, you'll get a little\nbit of extra time to gather up those Ether Cubes.
481	After that time is up, you'll be automatically\ntransported back to the Land of Challenge.
482	The allotted time is up!
483	Every Challenge Battle has its own time limit, which you\ncan check when accepting the challenge. Keep an eye\non the clock as you fight to avoid disappointment!
484	That's the signal for the next [System:Color name=tutorial ]wave[/System:Color]!
485	A new wave is triggered after a certain length of time,\nor when the old one is defeated. The number of\nenemies varies depending on the challenge.
486	The special battle\n"Call the Exterminators"\nis about to begin.
487	In this battle, you'll be aiming to get a [System:Color name=tutorial ]high score[/System:Color].\nDeal [System:Color name=tutorial ]Chain Attacks[/System:Color] and a [System:Color name=tutorial ]variety of combos[/System:Color] to give\nyour score a boost.
488	The special battle\n"Attack of the Aspar"\nis about to begin.
489	As the Aspar loses HP, its level will increase.
490	How high can you raise the Aspar's level before you\ndefeat it? Let's find out! (Its maximum level is 200.)
491	The special battle\n"Titan Battleship Assault"\nis about to begin.
492	There are 100 enemies within the Titan Battleship.\nControlling Jin, defeat them all as quickly as you can!
493	Here you can trade [System:Color name=tutorial ]Noponstone[/System:Color] for\nrare and special items.
494	A special item like [System:Color name=tutorial ]Disguised Pyra[/System:Color] will change the\nappearance of the character whose name it bears\nwhen equipped to that character.
495	You can equip it to a different character if you want,\nbut it'll just act like a normal item in this case, and\nthe character's appearance won't change.
496	Earn as much Noponstone as you can by clearing\nChallenge Battles!
497	Players who use Nia in her Blade form may have to\nreturn her to Driver form to be able to use Fiora\nas a Blade.
498	Shulk and Fiora are currently in the party's reserves.
499	A [System:Color name=tutorial ]team [/System:Color]is composed of a Driver and their Blades.\nThe level, EXP, HP, Strength, Ether, Agility, Dexterity,\nand Luck stats are [System:Color name=tutorial ]common to all members of a team[/System:Color].
500	With every auto-attack hit, your [System:Color name=tutorial ]Art gauges [/System:Color]will fill up\nslightly. This is called Arts recharge. With the gauge\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]full[/System:Color], press the corresponding button to [System:Color name=tutorial ]use the Art[/System:Color].
501	Approach an enemy and press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=R ][/System:Color] to target them.\nWith an enemy targeted, press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=A ][/System:Color] to draw weapons.\nA character with their weapon drawn will [System:Color name=tutorial ]auto-attack[/System:Color].
502	If you [System:Color name=tutorial ]use an Art [/System:Color]at [System:Color name=tutorial ]the precise moment an auto-attack\nconnects[/System:Color], you can cancel into the Art without winding\ndown from the attack. This is called [System:Color name=tutorial ]action canceling[/System:Color].
503	You can [System:Color name=tutorial ]cancel Arts into Specials [/System:Color]too, and by\nunlocking certain nodes on Affinity charts, it becomes\npossible to [System:Color name=tutorial ]cancel Arts into other Arts[/System:Color].
504	A successful cancel will [System:Color name=tutorial ]charge the Special gauge\nmore than usual[/System:Color], so it's worth learning this tricky\ntechnique if you want to maximize efficiency!
505	In battle, a team is [System:Color name=tutorial ]split between Vanguard and\nRear Guard positions[/System:Color]. The character in the vanguard\nis the [System:Color name=tutorial ]attacker[/System:Color], while the rear guard plays [System:Color name=tutorial ]support[/System:Color].
506	[System:Color name=tutorial ]You[/System:Color], as the player, [System:Color name=tutorial ]directly control the vanguard[/System:Color]. The\nrear guard will attack and provide buffs automatically.
507	[System:Color name=tutorial ]When a team's HP reaches 0, they'll be incapacitated[/System:Color].\nIf you can't continue the fight, you'll be returned to the\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]last landmark you passed[/System:Color], without any further penalties.
508	When you receive an attack, the [System:Color name=tutorial ]damage you took [/System:Color]will\nbe displayed as a [System:Color name=tutorial ]red bar[/System:Color], indicating [System:Color name=tutorial ]recoverable HP[/System:Color].\nThis damage is [System:Color name=tutorial ]healed by using a Vanguard Switch[/System:Color].
509	The recoverable HP will [System:Color name=tutorial ]drain over time[/System:Color].\nPerforming Vanguard Switches whenever you can\nand keeping your HP high is the key to victory!
510	Once the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Rear Guard gauge[/System:Color] fills up in battle,\nyou can press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=up ][/System:Color] or [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=down ][/System:Color] to perform a maneuver\ncalled a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Vanguard Switch[/System:Color].
511	When you trigger a Vanguard Switch, the rear guard\nwill [System:Color name=tutorial ]move up to trade places with the vanguard [/System:Color]while\nattacking with their [System:Color name=tutorial ]Switch Art[/System:Color].
512	After the switch, the new vanguard's [System:Color name=tutorial ]Art gauges\nwill be full[/System:Color], ready to be used immediately, so using\na Vanguard Switch is a good way to press an attack.
513	A Special is a move that uses [System:Color name=tutorial ]cooperation between\nthe team members [/System:Color]to great effect.
514	Using Arts will in turn charge the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Special gauge[/System:Color].\nThis is called Special recharge. When this gauge is [System:Color name=tutorial ]full[/System:Color],\nyou can press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=A ][/System:Color] to [System:Color name=tutorial ]use a Special[/System:Color].
515	You can charge the Special gauge up [System:Color name=tutorial ]beyond level 1,\nall the way up to 4[/System:Color]. Whereas level 1 has the vanguard\nattack alone, [System:Color name=tutorial ]levels 2, 3, and 4 are a real team effort[/System:Color]!
516	When using a Special, a [System:Color name=tutorial ]button challenge [/System:Color]will pop up\non screen. [System:Color name=tutorial ]Press the right button at the right time [/System:Color]as\ninstructed, and the move's [System:Color name=tutorial ]effect will be magnified[/System:Color].
517	What you're looking at right now is a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Collection Point[/System:Color].\nCheck here to uncover [System:Color name=tutorial ]collectible items[/System:Color].
518	You'll find Collection Points all over Alrest, and each\narea will have its own selection of items to discover.
519	Also, there are some Collection Points where you can\nuse Blades' [System:Color name=tutorial ]Field Skills[/System:Color] to find special collectible items\nthat you couldn't get otherwise.
520	The collectibles that you find are sure to come in handy\nduring your adventure, so if you come across a\nCollection Point, be sure to check it out!
521	Certain places out in the wild allow you to make\ncamp. The three things you can do at a campsite\nare [System:Color name=tutorial ]resting[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]crafting[/System:Color], and [System:Color name=tutorial ]chatting[/System:Color].
522	Rest: Use Bonus EXP to level teams up.\nCraft: Use collectibles to make items.\nChat: Speak with allies for advice on how to proceed.
523	As you can see, camps are places of preparation\nand growth. [System:Color name=tutorial ]When entering a new area[/System:Color], it's worth\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]scouting out the next campsite first[/System:Color].
524	Crafting is one of the actions available when camping.\nIt expends collectibles to create [System:Color name=tutorial ]pouch items [/System:Color]as well as\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]valuable unique items with particular properties[/System:Color].
525	As your adventure progresses, you can obtain more\nrecipes to expand your crafting repertoire, for example\nby [System:Color name=tutorial ]completing quests [/System:Color]or raiding [System:Color name=tutorial ]treasure troves[/System:Color].
526	[System:Color name=tutorial ]Pouch items [/System:Color]can be set inside a Driver's [System:Color name=tutorial ]pouch [/System:Color]to\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]empower that Driver's team [/System:Color]for a fixed duration.
527	You can always create more by crafting them at\na campsite, so use them as much as you can, for\ninstance, when preparing for a difficult battle ahead.
528	Lasaria Woodland, where you are right now, is a special\nkind of [System:Color name=tutorial ]area [/System:Color]known as a [System:Color name=tutorial ]landmark[/System:Color].
529	Alrest features three kinds of areas:\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]locations[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]landmarks[/System:Color], and [System:Color name=tutorial ]secret areas[/System:Color].
530	You can [System:Color name=tutorial ]instantly travel [/System:Color]to any previously-discovered\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]landmark [/System:Color]or [System:Color name=tutorial ]secret area[/System:Color] from the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Skip Travel menu[/System:Color]\nfound in the Main Menu.
531	Ah, it looks like you've found a treasure trove!\nYou'll discover troves of [System:Color name=tutorial ]many shapes and sizes\n[/System:Color]as you journey across Alrest.
532	Some of them might be locked, so you won't be able\nto get to the goods unless your [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blades have the right\nField Skills[/System:Color]. But it's always good to check first!
533	If you try targeting all sorts of enemies, you'll\noccasionally encounter ones whose [System:Color name=tutorial ]target icon\nlooks different from that of normal enemies[/System:Color].
534	We call those [System:Color name=tutorial ]unique monsters[/System:Color], and they're\na little bit special.
535	Unique monsters are much tougher than the\nregular kind. Even the strongest Drivers in Alrest\noften have trouble with them.
536	So if you take down a unique monster, you'll surely\nearn the respect of people all over Alrest!
537	That said, they're not a challenge for the faint-hearted.\nYou'll want to make sure you're prepared if you plan on\nsurviving the powerful attacks they often wield.
538	If you defeat a unique monster, a tombstone will remain\nat the site where it lived, in memory of its legend.
539	Some even say that if you press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=A ][/System:Color] at the\ntombstone, the monster will rise from its grave\nto reclaim its former glory!
540	As you probably noticed, the bridge ahead is out.\nIt's an obstacle, but not an insurmountable one!\nUsing a Blade's [System:Color name=tutorial ]Field Skill [/System:Color]might provide a solution.
541	Check out that [System:Color name=tutorial ]withered tree [/System:Color]up ahead and witness\nJin's Field Skill at work.
542	Incidentally, if you'd like to know more about it, you\ncan check Jin's Field Skills by going to [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu [/System:Color]>\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Characters [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Setup[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Info[/System:Color].
543	There are many places in the world of Alrest where\nyou'll need Field Skills to proceed.
544	Though it might look like you've hit a dead end,\nit's important not to get discouraged and check\nyour surroundings carefully.
545	Now that Haze has (re)joined your party,\nyou'll be able to [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Switch[/System:Color].
546	When a team contains [System:Color name=tutorial ]two Blades[/System:Color], performing a\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Switch [/System:Color]while exploring or in battle lets you\nselect [System:Color name=tutorial ]which of the Blades will participate in the action[/System:Color].
547	You can perform a Blade Switch by pressing [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=left ][/System:Color].\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]In battle[/System:Color], the technique comes with a cooldown timer\nso you [System:Color name=tutorial ]won't be able to use it in quick succession[/System:Color].
548	By combining [System:Color name=tutorial ]Vanguard Switching [/System:Color]and [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Switching[/System:Color],\nyou can choose the battle participants to suit your\nplay style, or as the situation requires.
549	You've just received a [System:Color name=tutorial ]quest[/System:Color]! Well done, you.\nQuests can broadly be divided into [System:Color name=tutorial ]main story quests[/System:Color]\nand [System:Color name=tutorial ]regular quests[/System:Color].
550	This one is a main story quest, which means it's\nrequired to progress through the game's story.\nIts objective appears on the compass as a [System:Color name=tutorial ]pink "!!" icon[/System:Color].
551	Many people out in the world have troubles they'd\nappreciate your help with. Those characters will have\na [System:Color name=tutorial ]blue "?" icon [/System:Color]above their heads.
552	Speak to them, and they'll explain the situation,\nrequesting your assistance with something.\nThat's how regular quests work.
553	Resolving their issues will surely move them\nto reward you with a nice gift in return.
554	Regular quests are not necessary to progress through\nthe game's story, and are marked on the compass with\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]blue icons[/System:Color].
555	Now then, let's use Haze's powers to get rid\nof the ether miasma here.
556	Titans, the great continents of Alrest, are living beings,\nand one of the waste products they generate manifests\nas [System:Color name=tutorial ]ether miasma[/System:Color].
557	Ether miasma tends to attract monsters, so [System:Color name=tutorial ]removing it[/System:Color]\nisn't the safest of occupations. It is, however, rewarding,\nas doing so [System:Color name=tutorial ]unlocks a new collection point [/System:Color]each time.
558	Clearing away the miasma requires the right [System:Color name=tutorial ]Field Skills[/System:Color].\nThese can be acquired and improved by unlocking the\nright nodes on Blades' Affinity Charts.
559	Each of your party characters has [System:Color name=tutorial ]a unique Art [/System:Color]that\nonly they can use, called a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Talent Art[/System:Color].
560	If you meet the requirements for activating it, you can\npress [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=right ][/System:Color] to do so. To check the conditions and effects\nof Talent Arts, [System:Color name=tutorial ]visit the Enhance Arts menu[/System:Color].
561	Talent Arts have [System:Color name=tutorial ]very powerful effects[/System:Color], but can come\nwith [System:Color name=tutorial ]significant downsides [/System:Color]as well. Be sure to consider\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]when and how to use them [/System:Color]to get the most benefit.
562	[System:Color name=tutorial ]Attacking[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]healing [/System:Color]your team, and other actions which\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]your foes consider undesirable [/System:Color]will make the characters\nperforming them accrue a value called [System:Color name=tutorial ]aggro[/System:Color].
563	Aggro is accumulated [System:Color name=tutorial ]individually by each team[/System:Color], and\nenemies will [System:Color name=tutorial ]attack the team with the highest aggro[/System:Color].
564	Try to manage your aggro so that teams with low HP\nor ones with low defense values [System:Color name=tutorial ]don't get targeted[/System:Color].\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Reining in attacks [/System:Color]for a time is a useful technique.
565	The [System:Color name=tutorial ]goodwill Lora and her friends create[/System:Color] is known\nas [System:Color name=tutorial ]Community[/System:Color].
566	The foundation of Community is talking to the many\nand various inhabitants of Alrest. Speak to a person,\nand you'll learn their name, job, and location.
567	You can always check this information by going to\nthe [System:Color name=tutorial ]Community [/System:Color]menu, [System:Color name=tutorial ]found in the Main Menu[/System:Color].\nTalk to everyone you can and expand your Community!
568	Resolve an issue that a person listed in the Community\nmenu is struggling with, and they'll give you a token of\ntheir support for you.
569	Collect a lot, and your [System:Color name=tutorial ]Community will grow stronger[/System:Color]!\nRaising the Community level will cause [System:Color name=tutorial ]more quests\nto become available[/System:Color]. What comes around goes around!
570	Spreading the Community spirit lets Lora, Jin, and their\nallies make their mark on the world. Doing good for the\nbenefit of Alrest is its own reward!
571	Certain Arts and Switch Arts have the ability to inflict\ncertain [System:Color name=tutorial ]status changes on the enemy[/System:Color].
572	The four statuses are: [System:Color name=tutorial ]Break[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]Topple[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]Launch[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]Smash[/System:Color].\nInflicting them [System:Color name=tutorial ]in that order[/System:Color], starting with Break, is\ncalled a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Driver Combo[/System:Color].
573	From Topple onward, inflicting the status will cause\nfoes to drop HP Potions, and they won't fight back.\nYou can use this to your advantage in battle!
574	Level 4 Specials are extremely powerful, and there's\na certain trick to pulling one off.
575	With the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Special gauge charged up to level 3[/System:Color],\nmoving the Driver [System:Color name=tutorial ]close to [/System:Color]the Blade will cause\nthe gauge to fill up further.
576	Once it fills all the way, the [System:Color name=tutorial ]level 4 Special is ready[/System:Color].\nHowever, if the Driver and Blade move [System:Color name=tutorial ]too far apart[/System:Color],\nthe [System:Color name=tutorial ]gauge will deplete [/System:Color]and you'll have to start over.
577	[System:Color name=tutorial ]Hitting an enemy with a Special [/System:Color]begins a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Combo.[/System:Color]\nA Blade Combo consists of three stages, and [System:Color name=tutorial ]finishing[/System:Color]\nit requires you to [System:Color name=tutorial ]move through them in order[/System:Color].
578	The [System:Color name=tutorial ]first, second, and third [/System:Color]stages of a Blade Combo\nrequire you to hit the enemy with a Special that's\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]at least level 1, 2, and 3 respectively [/System:Color]to link them up.
579	You can also link up [System:Color name=tutorial ]other team's Specials[/System:Color]. When a\nteam can use a Special, a [System:Color name=tutorial ]combo request [/System:Color]will appear on\nthe screen for you to [System:Color name=tutorial ]give the order[/System:Color]. Think carefully!
580	You can continue a Blade Combo [System:Color name=tutorial ]all the way to stage 3[/System:Color]\nwith [System:Color name=tutorial ]Specials of any element[/System:Color], as long as you keep to the\nlevel requirements, but there are some fixed routes.
581	These [System:Color name=tutorial ]critical routes [/System:Color]number [System:Color name=tutorial ]16 in total[/System:Color], and they're\ncomposed of a particular sequence of elements.\nFor example, one such route is [System:Color name=tutorial ]Fire [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Fire [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Light[/System:Color].
582	A finished critical route will trigger a [System:Color name=tutorial ]special animation\n[/System:Color]and [System:Color name=tutorial ]cause extra damage[/System:Color], so be on the lookout for the\nother 15 special element sequences!

589	Contributing to a Blade Combo will cause [System:Color name=tutorial ]element orbs\n[/System:Color]to start orbiting the enemy. You can then destroy them\nand [System:Color name=tutorial ]inflict other special effects [/System:Color]by using a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Chain Attack[/System:Color].
590	Press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=plus ] [/System:Color]when your Party Gauge has [System:Color name=tutorial ]all three bars full[/System:Color]\nto launch an attack sequence where teams take turns\nhitting the foe, and an element orb, with Specials.
591	When an orb is hit [System:Color name=tutorial ]three times[/System:Color], it will be destroyed.\nA [System:Color name=tutorial ]Special of the opposite element [/System:Color]to an orb on the\nenemy will [System:Color name=tutorial ]count for two hits[/System:Color]. This last part is key!
592	Destroying an orb has a lot of nice effects: it [System:Color name=tutorial ]extends\nthe Chain Attack[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]raises the damage bonus[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]fills up the\nFull Burst gauge[/System:Color], and [System:Color name=tutorial ]recharges used characters[/System:Color].
593	Normally in a Chain Attack, [System:Color name=tutorial ]each team will act once [/System:Color]and\nthat's it, but if you manage to [System:Color name=tutorial ]destroy an element orb[/System:Color],\nthe attack will be [System:Color name=tutorial ]extended by an extra round[/System:Color].
594	If you succeed in the [System:Color name=tutorial ]button challenge [/System:Color]that appears \nwhen the round is extended, the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Specials you use will\nget a level up [/System:Color]and be [System:Color name=tutorial ]recharged[/System:Color], so be ready for it!
595	When you launch a Chain Attack, the Party Gauge\nwill be replaced by the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Full Burst gauge [/System:Color]for the\nduration.
596	With each [System:Color name=tutorial ]element orb you destroy[/System:Color], the Full Burst\ngauge will [System:Color name=tutorial ]fill up a little[/System:Color]. If you can fill it [System:Color name=tutorial ]completely[/System:Color],\na Full Burst will trigger, dealing [System:Color name=tutorial ]massive damage[/System:Color].
597	Additionally, if you defeat an enemy during the\nChain Attack, Overkill will begin. Dealing more damage\nduring Overkill nets you extra [System:Color name=tutorial ]EXP[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]WP[/System:Color], and [System:Color name=tutorial ]SP[/System:Color].
598	You've unlocked the ability to change party order!\nTo do so, go to [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Characters[/System:Color], then press\n[System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=X ][/System:Color] and choose which team you want to control.
599	The team in [System:Color name=tutorial ]position 1 [/System:Color]will be under your\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]direct control[/System:Color].
600	Every team has its own style of doing battle, so\nfeel free to experiment with them until you've found\none that best suits your preference!
601	You might find certain mysterious stone pillars on your\nadventures, called [System:Color name=tutorial ]Barney Stones[/System:Color]. They're a feature\nthat's unique to Torna.
602	Checking out a Barney Stone means [System:Color name=tutorial ]you'll have to\nfight off some monsters[/System:Color], but if you can manage it,\nyou'll get some [System:Color name=tutorial ]hidden treasure[/System:Color]. Preparation is key!
603	A [System:Color name=tutorial ]Seeker [/System:Color]is an item which [System:Color name=tutorial ]Hugo can craft[/System:Color]. With it,\nyou'll be able to investigate the [System:Color name=tutorial ]old machines [/System:Color]strewn\naround the world and obtain [System:Color name=tutorial ]new kinds of Collectibles[/System:Color].
604	There are [System:Color name=tutorial ]two different kinds [/System:Color]of Seeker, and each lets\nyou investigate a [System:Color name=tutorial ]different kind of machine[/System:Color]. It's worth\ngetting both, then gathering all the Collectibles you can!
605	You've received a [System:Color name=tutorial ]crafting recipe [/System:Color]for Lora!\nYou don't just get them as quest rewards, but also\nfrom increasing Community or from treasure troves.
606	New recipes let you create items you couldn't\ncreate previously, which is enormously exciting.\nCheck them out while [System:Color name=tutorial ]camping[/System:Color]!
607	In this battle, the Party Gauge is replaced by the\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Siren Gauge[/System:Color], which you charge by [System:Color name=tutorial ]scoring hits\nagainst Malos[/System:Color].
608	When [System:Color name=tutorial ]all three sections [/System:Color]of the gauge are charged,\npress [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=plus ][/System:Color] to make Siren use an [System:Color name=tutorial ]Artifice Art[/System:Color].
609	Artifice Arts will not only [System:Color name=tutorial ]deal damage to Malos's Siren[/System:Color],\nthey'll also [System:Color name=tutorial ]boost your team's attack power[/System:Color].
610	Similarly, [System:Color name=tutorial ]Malos also has a Siren Gauge he will charge[/System:Color].\nWhen the gauge is full, he will [System:Color name=tutorial ]attack Mythra's Siren[/System:Color]\nwith Artifice Arts, and [System:Color name=tutorial ]get a boost to his own attack[/System:Color].
611	The Artifice Arts [System:Color name=tutorial ]get stronger the more they are used[/System:Color],\nso the key to prevailing is to try and reach the higher-\nlevel Artifice Arts before Malos does.
612	Furthermore, you [System:Color name=tutorial ]won't be able to use Chain Attacks[/System:Color]\nwhile the Siren Gauge is displayed, so plan accordingly!

617	The feature that the arrow is pointing to right now\nis the [System:Color name=tutorial ]compass[/System:Color]. The markers on it show you where\nLora and her friends should go next.
618	The [System:Color name=tutorial ]number [/System:Color]above each marker gives the [System:Color name=tutorial ]distance to\nthat objective[/System:Color]. Also, if the objective is located above\nor below you, you'll see an arrow pointing [System:Color name=tutorial ]up or down[/System:Color].
619	Now the arrow's pointing to the [System:Color name=tutorial ]environmental info[/System:Color].\nThis gives you the name of your current area, as well\nas the [System:Color name=tutorial ]weather [/System:Color]and the [System:Color name=tutorial ]time[/System:Color].
620	The [System:Color name=tutorial ]mini-map[/System:Color] gives you an idea of what's around you.\nPressing [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=L3 ][/System:Color] lets you change its zoom and size, and the\nmark in the center shows your position and facing.
621	Lastly, your [System:Color name=tutorial ]current objective [/System:Color]window. This explains\nwhat Lora and co. should be doing right now.
622	The two main ways of making your entire team stronger\nare [System:Color name=tutorial ]leveling up [/System:Color]and [System:Color name=tutorial ]using pouch items[/System:Color].
623	Leveling up:\nWhen you earn enough [System:Color name=tutorial ]EXP [/System:Color]through fighting battles,\nyou'll level up, increasing the [System:Color name=tutorial ]team's stats[/System:Color].
624	Pouch Items:\nAdd a pouch item to a Driver's pouch to [System:Color name=tutorial ]empower\nthe team with a certain buff [/System:Color]for a fixed duration.
625	There are [System:Color name=tutorial ]three ways [/System:Color]to make a Driver stronger.\nYou can either [System:Color name=tutorial ]improve the actual character [/System:Color]in one of\ntwo ways, or [System:Color name=tutorial ]improve their equipment[/System:Color].
626	Improving Driver Characters\nEnhance Arts: Use [System:Color name=tutorial ]WP [/System:Color]earned in battle.\nAffinity Chart: Use [System:Color name=tutorial ]SP [/System:Color]earned in battle.
627	Improving Driver Equipment\nAccessories: [System:Color name=tutorial ]Equip accessories[/System:Color] you own.\n(Weapon slot accessories come from defeated foes.)
628	There are [System:Color name=tutorial ]four ways [/System:Color]to make a Blade stronger. You can\neither [System:Color name=tutorial ]improve the actual character [/System:Color]in one of two ways,\nor [System:Color name=tutorial ]improve their equipment [/System:Color]in one of two ways.
629	Improving Blade Characters\nEnhance Arts: Use [System:Color name=tutorial ]WP [/System:Color]earned in battle.\nAffinity Chart: [System:Color name=tutorial ]Complete required tasks[/System:Color].
630	Improving Blade Equipment\nWpn. Mod.: Use [System:Color name=tutorial ]Core Chips[/System:Color], mostly found as treasure.\nAux Cores: Equip [System:Color name=tutorial ]Aux Cores[/System:Color], mostly dropped by foes.
631	Lora's Talent Art [System:Color name=tutorial ]sacrifices half of her HP [/System:Color]in order to\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]fully recharge all of her Arts[/System:Color]. If you're flush with HP,\nuse it and hammer the enemy with all you've got.
632	Jin's Talent Art lets him [System:Color name=tutorial ]temporarily boost his attack[/System:Color],\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]accuracy[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]evasion [/System:Color]and [System:Color name=tutorial ]speed [/System:Color]in proportion to [System:Color name=tutorial ]how much\nrecoverable HP [/System:Color]he has. More HP means bigger boost.
633	Haze's Talent Art [System:Color name=tutorial ]completely drains the charge on all\nof her Vanguard Arts [/System:Color]and in return [System:Color name=tutorial ]immobilizes enemies\nfor a time[/System:Color]. It's super powerful, but requires good timing.
634	Team Lora is a [System:Color name=tutorial ]well-rounded group proficient at both\nattacking and healing[/System:Color]. When you're new to the game\nor struggling in battle, this is a good team to go with.
635	Leading with Lora's [System:Color name=tutorial ]Hungry Snake [/System:Color]Art, then quickly\nVanguard Switching to Jin to inflict Topple is a strong\nplay. Low on HP? Vanguard Switch to [System:Color name=tutorial ]Haze and heal[/System:Color].
636	Addam's Talent Art [System:Color name=tutorial ]trades HP [/System:Color]for a [System:Color name=tutorial ]longer window of\nopportunity for Driver Combos[/System:Color]. It's just what you need\nwhen you're shooting for that Driver Combo finisher.
637	Mythra's Talent Art is useful when the [System:Color name=tutorial ]party's in\ntrouble[/System:Color]. It allows the [System:Color name=tutorial ]whole party to evade a certain\nnumber of attacks[/System:Color], giving you a chance to turn the tide.
638	Minoth's Talent Art can be used [System:Color name=tutorial ]at maximum Affinity[/System:Color].\nIt [System:Color name=tutorial ]doubles the next Art's damage, and triples the aggro[/System:Color].\nUsing it too often can bring too much heat to handle.
639	Team Addam [System:Color name=tutorial ]excels on the offense[/System:Color]. Use mighty Arts\nand Specials in succession to make short work of foes.\nThe defense is lacking, though, so [System:Color name=tutorial ]watch the aggro[/System:Color].
640	Use Addam's [System:Color name=tutorial ]Rising Arc [/System:Color]Art on a Toppled enemy, then\nVanguard Switch to Mythra for a quick and easy Smash.\nThis will deal huge damage, and spawn HP Potions too.
641	Hugo's Talent Art [System:Color name=tutorial ]costs a portion of his HP [/System:Color]and [System:Color name=tutorial ]forces\nenemies to target him for a while[/System:Color]. Using Guard Shift\nright after is a strong defensive move.
642	Brighid's Talent Art can be used [System:Color name=tutorial ]when her health is low[/System:Color].\nIt [System:Color name=tutorial ]damages foes while empowering her allies' attacks[/System:Color].\nThere's no cost to it, so use it whenever your HP is low.
643	Aegaeon's Talent Art is great [System:Color name=tutorial ]when you're struggling[/System:Color].\nFor a time, [System:Color name=tutorial ]you'll counterattack when you evade[/System:Color].\nPair it with [System:Color name=tutorial ]Breaking Wave [/System:Color]and watch foes drop.
644	Team Hugo [System:Color name=tutorial ]excels at defense[/System:Color], evading and blocking\nenemy attacks with ease. Their role is to [System:Color name=tutorial ]focus enemy\naggro on themselves and protect their allies[/System:Color].
645	Brighid has Support Arts that reduce enemy defense,\nwhile Aegaeon's can empower the vanguard. [System:Color name=tutorial ]Switching\nbetween Blades to match the situation [/System:Color]is important.
646	But first, here's a free Special Gauge top-up so you can\ntry using a level 4 Special and admire Lora and Jin's\nflawless coordination.
647	Here, have a free [System:Color name=tutorial ]element orb [/System:Color]and [System:Color name=tutorial ]Party Gauge\nrefill[/System:Color]. Now you've got all you need to press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=plus ][/System:Color],\ntrigger a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Chain Attack[/System:Color], and watch the sparks fly!
648	Now, a piece of important advice. Did you see that\nnotification that said [System:Color name=tutorial ]new tips have been added[/System:Color]?
649	In this game, you can [System:Color name=tutorial ]check previous tutorials [/System:Color]from\nthe menu. The notification just now was to tell you\nthat new options have been added to the menu.
650	If you run into something you're unsure of while\nplaying, go to [System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]System[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]Tips [/System:Color]to see\nif it's been explained there.
651	When you get an [System:Color name=tutorial ]Affinity Reward[/System:Color] for fulfilling a\ncondition on a Blade's [System:Color name=tutorial ]Affinity Chart[/System:Color], you'll get\na [System:Color name=tutorial ]pop-up[/System:Color] notification.
652	The Affinity Reward itself won't be unlocked\nat this point, though, so you won't notice any\ndifference just yet.
653	When you get the Affinity Reward pop-up,\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]be sure to check the unlocked ability in the menu[/System:Color].\nIf you don't, the Blade won't develop.
654	Additionally, you can press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=ZL ][/System:Color] (outside of battle) to\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]change which team you control directly[/System:Color]. It's a rather\nuseful feature, so feel free to play around with it!
655	Just one more [System:Color name=tutorial ]note about level 4 Specials[/System:Color].\nThe technique for Driver and Blade sharing one weapon\nis a [System:Color name=tutorial ]unique innovation by Lora and her companions[/System:Color].
656	Therefore, if you're controlling a team other than\nLora's, you [System:Color name=tutorial ]won't be able to use level 4 Specials\nin battle[/System:Color].
657	But, who knows? As the adventure continues,\nAddam and Hugo might pick up this skill too, one day.\nUntil then, do your best working with what you've got!
658	You can now engage [System:Color name=tutorial ]Elma [/System:Color]as a Blade!\nCurrently, she's engaged on [System:Color name=tutorial ]Rex[/System:Color].
659	You'll be able to engage her to any Driver\n(except Tora) [System:Color name=tutorial ]without having to use an\nOverdrive Protocol[/System:Color].
660	I hope you're looking forward to discovering how [System:Color name=tutorial ]Elma[/System:Color]\nperforms in battle, and using her to the utmost!
661	However, you won't be able to take [System:Color name=tutorial ]Elma [/System:Color]with you\nwhen you leave the Land of Challenge.
662	When you travel through the portal to [System:Color name=tutorial ]return to Alrest[/System:Color],\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Elma will be removed from the party[/System:Color], so be sure to\nfactor that in when planning your journey.
663	Rumor has it that among the various rewards that the\nNopon Archsage gives out for his Challenge Battles is\nan item that will let Elma enter Alrest.
664	Engaging [System:Color name=tutorial ]Overdrive [/System:Color]is a special ability that Elma has.\nTo use it, press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=R ] and [ML:icon icon=minus ] [/System:Color]with Elma on the battlefield.\nDoing this requires a [System:Color name=tutorial ]fully filled Party Gauge[/System:Color].
665	[System:Color name=tutorial ]Hit with Arts while Overdrive is engaged[/System:Color], and the hits\nwill be counted on the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Overdrive Counter [/System:Color]in the middle\nof the screen. Hits with [System:Color name=tutorial ]Specials count at a 5x rate[/System:Color].
666	You can gain [System:Color name=tutorial ]three kinds of bonuses [/System:Color]by raising the\nhit count: [System:Color name=tutorial ]damage boost[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]recharge boost[/System:Color],[System:Color name=tutorial ] lower enemy\nresistance[/System:Color]. The effect increases with the hit count.
667	You can increase the [System:Color name=tutorial ]duration [/System:Color]of Overdrive by filling up\nthe entire Party Gauge while Overdrive is engaged, and\nthen [System:Color name=tutorial ]activating Overdrive again[/System:Color].
668	However, [System:Color name=tutorial ]while Overdrive is in effect[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]Party Gauge gain\nis reduced[/System:Color], and you [System:Color name=tutorial ]can't use Chain Attacks[/System:Color]. Be mindful\nof the downsides as you think of the best time to use it!
669	Congratulations! You can now bring [System:Color name=tutorial ]Elma [/System:Color]with you\nwhen you return to Alrest.
670	Oh, and one more thing.\nThe menu is automatically opened every time\nsomeone's info is added to the Community screen.
671	But that can be disabled by turning on\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Skip Community Registration[/System:Color] in\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Main Menu[/System:Color] > [System:Color name=tutorial ]System [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Options [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Game Settings[/System:Color].
672	This option is recommended for people\nwho want to build Community quickly!
673	You can [System:Color name=tutorial ]gain Community[/System:Color] from people with\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]yellow icons above their head[/System:Color] just by [System:Color name=tutorial ]talking\nto them[/System:Color]. You don't have to complete a quest.
674	If you see the same icon next to someone's face\non the Community menu, you can select them and\npress [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=Y ] [/System:Color]to add their location to the compass.
675	I'm sure your new friend will enjoy wielding her\nnewfound powers in this brave new world, too!
676	To do so, simply select her on the right Driver's\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Engage Blades screen[/System:Color].

2	How begin Challenge Battle?
3	What is key to success?
4	What happens if fail?
5	"Wave" not mean big water?
6	Please to explain Special Battles!
7	What we get out of all this?
8	Need way to return to Alrest!
9	Can see choice of difficulty!
10	[System:Color name=tutorial ]Challenge Battle[/System:Color] is extra tough battle specially\nselected by [System:Color name=tutorial ]Nopon Archsage[/System:Color]!
11	If friends can triumph, fantastic rewards await!
12	Challenge starts soon as words "[System:Color name=tutorial ]START!!![/System:Color]" appear\non screen. Then battle proceed like normal!
13	But please make careful check before starting,\nas some challenges come with [System:Color name=tutorial ]special conditions\n[/System:Color]like [System:Color name=tutorial ]setting to fixed level[/System:Color] or [System:Color name=tutorial ]needing specific Drivers[/System:Color]!
14	Key to success is simple. Friends just need to complete\nall challenge criteria within time limit!
15	あとは散りばめられた[System:Color name=tutorial ]エーテルキューブ[/System:Color]を集めるだけも！
16	If friends not fulfill all criteria within time limit,\nchallenge will be considered failure...
17	That also go for usual losing of battle. Must be\nfailure if friends not able to fight!
18	No, you thinking of wrong wave!\nThis [System:Color name=tutorial ]wave[/System:Color] refer to set of enemies!
19	Actually, whole wave can sometimes be single enemy,\nor could be whole legion. But as long as friends\nbashy-bash them into submission, is no problem!
20	Special Battles have special goal. For instance, must\naim for [System:Color name=tutorial ]high score[/System:Color] in "Call the Exterminators". Points\nearned vary depending on way you defeat enemy!
21	In "Attack of the Aspar", is all about how high friends\ncan [System:Color name=tutorial ]raise Aspar level[/System:Color] before defeating.
22	And in "Titan Battleship Assault", friends get to play\nspecial scenario as Jin and try to [System:Color name=tutorial ]slashy-slash 100\nenemies quickly as possible[/System:Color]!
23	In Challenge Battles, enemies who defeated drop\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Ether Cubes[/System:Color]!
24	If friends can collect over certain amount, can be\nexchanged for treasure troves at end of challenge!\nIs good idea to collect many as possible!
25	But trade-off is that friends not able to earn\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]EXP[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]Gold[/System:Color], or [System:Color name=tutorial ]SP [/System:Color]from enemies. That very\nimportant fact!
26	Simple! Friends need only to face [System:Color name=tutorial ]portal[/System:Color] that brought\nyou to Land of Challenge and press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=A ][/System:Color]!
27	Well-spotted! Yes, is easy to change difficulty of\nChallenge Battles by selecting challenge of choice\nand then pressing [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=L ][/System:Color] or [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=R ][/System:Color]!

85	A [System:Color name=tutorial ]team [/System:Color]is composed of a Driver and their Blades.\nThe level, EXP, HP, Strength, Ether, Agility, Dexterity,\nand Luck stats are [System:Color name=tutorial ]common to all members of a team[/System:Color].
86	In battle, a team is [System:Color name=tutorial ]split between Vanguard and\nRear Guard positions[/System:Color]. The character in the vanguard\nis the [System:Color name=tutorial ]attacker[/System:Color], while the rear guard plays [System:Color name=tutorial ]support[/System:Color].
87	[System:Color name=tutorial ]You[/System:Color], as the player, [System:Color name=tutorial ]directly control the vanguard[/System:Color]. The\nrear guard will attack and provide buffs automatically.
88	Approach an enemy and press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=R ][/System:Color] to target them.\nWith an enemy targeted, press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=A ][/System:Color] to draw weapons.\nA character with their weapon drawn will [System:Color name=tutorial ]auto-attack[/System:Color].
89	With every auto-attack hit, your [System:Color name=tutorial ]Art gauges [/System:Color]will fill up\nslightly. This is called Arts recharge. With the gauge\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]full[/System:Color], press the corresponding button to [System:Color name=tutorial ]use the Art[/System:Color].
90	Using Arts will in turn charge the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Special gauge[/System:Color].\nThis is called Special recharge. When this gauge is [System:Color name=tutorial ]full[/System:Color],\nyou can press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=A ][/System:Color] to [System:Color name=tutorial ]use a Special[/System:Color].
91	A Special is a move that uses [System:Color name=tutorial ]cooperation between\nthe team members [/System:Color]to great effect.
92	You can charge the Special gauge up [System:Color name=tutorial ]beyond level 1,\nall the way up to 4[/System:Color]. Whereas level 1 has the vanguard\nattack alone, [System:Color name=tutorial ]levels 2, 3, and 4 are a real team effort[/System:Color]!
93	When using a Special, a [System:Color name=tutorial ]button challenge [/System:Color]will pop up\non screen. [System:Color name=tutorial ]Press the right button at the right time [/System:Color]as\ninstructed, and the move's [System:Color name=tutorial ]effect will be magnified[/System:Color].
94	If you [System:Color name=tutorial ]use an Art [/System:Color]at [System:Color name=tutorial ]the precise moment an auto-attack\nconnects[/System:Color], you can cancel into the Art without winding\ndown from the attack. This is called [System:Color name=tutorial ]action canceling[/System:Color].
95	You can [System:Color name=tutorial ]cancel Arts into Specials [/System:Color]too, and by\nunlocking certain nodes on Affinity charts, it becomes\npossible to [System:Color name=tutorial ]cancel Arts into other Arts[/System:Color].
96	A successful cancel will [System:Color name=tutorial ]charge the Special gauge\nmore than usual[/System:Color], so it's worth learning this tricky\ntechnique if you want to maximize efficiency!
97	Once the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Rear Guard gauge[/System:Color] fills up in battle,\nyou can press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=up ][/System:Color] or [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=down ][/System:Color] to perform a maneuver\ncalled a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Vanguard Switch[/System:Color].
98	When you trigger a Vanguard Switch, the rear guard\nwill [System:Color name=tutorial ]move up to trade places with the vanguard [/System:Color]while\nattacking with their [System:Color name=tutorial ]Switch Art[/System:Color].
99	After the switch, the new vanguard's [System:Color name=tutorial ]Art gauges\nwill be full[/System:Color], ready to be used immediately, so using\na Vanguard Switch is a good way to press an attack.
100	If your team is running low on HP, be sure to heal by\ngrabbing HP Potions or using Healing Arts before you\nend up incapacitated.
101	HP Potions appear on the battlefield when you use\ncertain Arts, or when you Topple, Launch, or Smash\nan enemy, so grab them before they disappear!
102	[System:Color name=tutorial ]When a team's HP reaches 0, they'll be incapacitated[/System:Color].\nIf you can't continue the fight, you'll be returned to the\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]last landmark you passed[/System:Color], without any further penalties.
103	When you receive an attack, the [System:Color name=tutorial ]damage you took [/System:Color]will\nbe displayed as a [System:Color name=tutorial ]red bar[/System:Color], indicating [System:Color name=tutorial ]recoverable HP[/System:Color].\nThis damage is [System:Color name=tutorial ]healed by using a Vanguard Switch[/System:Color].
104	The recoverable HP will [System:Color name=tutorial ]drain over time[/System:Color].\nPerforming Vanguard Switches whenever you can\nand keeping your HP high is the key to victory!
105	The stream of light connecting Driver and Blade\nis called [System:Color name=tutorial ]Affinity[/System:Color], and it [System:Color name=tutorial ]changes status depending on\nhow you fight[/System:Color].
106	As affinity gets stronger within a team, e.g. by [System:Color name=tutorial ]fighting\nnear one another [/System:Color]and [System:Color name=tutorial ]following up each other's attacks[/System:Color],\nthe light will change to a [System:Color name=tutorial ]fiercely oscillating gold[/System:Color].
107	When Affinity is high, your in-battle [System:Color name=tutorial ]movement speed[/System:Color]\nand [System:Color name=tutorial ]Arts recharge rate [/System:Color]will increase, so it's a good idea\nto stay aware of your Affinity situation as you fight.
108	The bar at the top of the screen is the [System:Color name=tutorial ]compass[/System:Color].\nIt points the way to where you should be going next.
109	The [System:Color name=tutorial ]pink icon [/System:Color]shows [System:Color name=tutorial ]your next objective in the\nmain story[/System:Color]. [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blue icons [/System:Color]indicate [System:Color name=tutorial ]quest objectives[/System:Color].
110	The [System:Color name=tutorial ]number [/System:Color]above the icon indicates [System:Color name=tutorial ]distance[/System:Color].\nAn [System:Color name=tutorial ]arrow [/System:Color]pointing up or down means the goal is\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]above or below you[/System:Color], respectively.
111	The top right of the screen displays environmental\ninformation, like the [System:Color name=tutorial ]name of the area [/System:Color]you're in, the\ncurrent [System:Color name=tutorial ]time[/System:Color], and the [System:Color name=tutorial ]weather[/System:Color].
112	The small circle beneath the environmental info\ncontains the mini-map. This shows your [System:Color name=tutorial ]immediate\nsurroundings [/System:Color]and the [System:Color name=tutorial ]direction you're facing[/System:Color].
113	By pressing [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=L3 ][/System:Color], you can toggle the mini-map between\nfull screen, full screen zoomed, and hidden.\nExperiment and find the setting that works best for you!
114	The bottom-right corner of the screen displays your\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]current objective[/System:Color]. Press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=ZR ][/System:Color] to [System:Color name=tutorial ]toggle it on and off[/System:Color],\nand be sure to take a look if you're ever feeling lost.
115	Approach a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Collection Point [/System:Color]out in the world and\npress [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=A ][/System:Color] to [System:Color name=tutorial ]make Collectibles emerge[/System:Color].
116	You may [System:Color name=tutorial ]need them to complete quests[/System:Color], and they're\nalso used as [System:Color name=tutorial ]materials [/System:Color]when [System:Color name=tutorial ]crafting at campsites[/System:Color].
117	Certain places out in the wild allow you to make\ncamp. The three things you can do at a campsite\nare [System:Color name=tutorial ]resting[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]crafting[/System:Color], and [System:Color name=tutorial ]chatting[/System:Color].
118	Rest: Use Bonus EXP to level teams up.\nCraft: Use collectibles to make items.\nChat: Speak with allies for advice on how to proceed.
119	As you can see, camps are places of preparation\nand growth. [System:Color name=tutorial ]When entering a new area[/System:Color], it's worth\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]scouting out the next campsite first[/System:Color].
120	Crafting is one of the actions available when camping.\nIt expends collectibles to create [System:Color name=tutorial ]pouch items [/System:Color]as well as\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]valuable unique items with particular properties[/System:Color].
121	As your adventure progresses, you can obtain more\nrecipes to expand your crafting repertoire, for example\nby [System:Color name=tutorial ]completing quests [/System:Color]or raiding [System:Color name=tutorial ]treasure troves[/System:Color].
122	[System:Color name=tutorial ]Pouch items [/System:Color]can be set inside a Driver's [System:Color name=tutorial ]pouch [/System:Color]to\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]empower that Driver's team [/System:Color]for a fixed duration.
123	You can always create more by crafting them at\na campsite, so use them as much as you can, for\ninstance, when preparing for a difficult battle ahead.
124	Alrest features three kinds of areas:\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]locations[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]landmarks[/System:Color], and [System:Color name=tutorial ]secret areas[/System:Color].
125	You can [System:Color name=tutorial ]instantly travel [/System:Color]to any previously-discovered\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]landmark [/System:Color]or [System:Color name=tutorial ]secret area[/System:Color] from the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Skip Travel menu[/System:Color]\nfound in the Main Menu.
126	As you travel across Alrest, you may sometimes find\nobstacles barring your way or treasure troves which\nyou can't open just yet.
127	To [System:Color name=tutorial ]remove those obstacles and access those treasures[/System:Color],\nyou'll need to make use of special powers your Blades\nhave called [System:Color name=tutorial ]Field Skills[/System:Color].
128	If any of the skill levels are too low, you'll fail the check.\nIf that happens, check the Blade's [System:Color name=tutorial ]Affinity Chart [/System:Color]to see\nhow to unlock the nodes needed to improve the skill.
129	The two main ways of making your entire team stronger\nare [System:Color name=tutorial ]leveling up [/System:Color]and [System:Color name=tutorial ]using pouch items[/System:Color].
130	Leveling up:\nWhen you earn enough [System:Color name=tutorial ]EXP [/System:Color]through fighting battles,\nyou'll level up, increasing the [System:Color name=tutorial ]team's stats[/System:Color].
131	Pouch Items:\nAdd a pouch item to a Driver's pouch to [System:Color name=tutorial ]empower\nthe team with a certain buff [/System:Color]for a fixed duration.
132	There are [System:Color name=tutorial ]three ways [/System:Color]to make a Driver stronger.\nYou can either [System:Color name=tutorial ]improve the actual character [/System:Color]in one of\ntwo ways, or [System:Color name=tutorial ]improve their equipment[/System:Color].
133	Improving Driver Characters\nEnhance Arts: Use [System:Color name=tutorial ]WP [/System:Color]earned in battle.\nAffinity Chart: Use [System:Color name=tutorial ]SP [/System:Color]earned in battle.
134	Improving Driver Equipment\nAccessories: [System:Color name=tutorial ]Equip accessories[/System:Color] you own.\n(Weapon slot accessories come from defeated foes.)
135	There are [System:Color name=tutorial ]four ways [/System:Color]to make a Blade stronger. You can\neither [System:Color name=tutorial ]improve the actual character [/System:Color]in one of two ways,\nor [System:Color name=tutorial ]improve their equipment [/System:Color]in one of two ways.
136	Improving Blade Characters\nEnhance Arts: Use [System:Color name=tutorial ]WP [/System:Color]earned in battle.\nAffinity Chart: [System:Color name=tutorial ]Complete required tasks[/System:Color].
137	Improving Blade Equipment\nWpn. Mod.: Use [System:Color name=tutorial ]Core Chips[/System:Color], mostly found as treasure.\nAux Cores: Equip [System:Color name=tutorial ]Aux Cores[/System:Color], mostly dropped by foes.
138	Some enemies in Alrest grow [System:Color name=tutorial ]stronger and larger[/System:Color] than\ntheir peers, earning [System:Color name=tutorial ]a given name and a moniker[/System:Color].\nThose powerful entities are known as [System:Color name=tutorial ]unique monsters[/System:Color].
139	If you succeed at taking down a unique monster, it will\nleave a [System:Color name=tutorial ]tombstone [/System:Color]somewhere close to [System:Color name=tutorial ]where it used to\nappear[/System:Color].
140	If you approach the tombstone and press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=A ][/System:Color], you can\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]fight the unique monster again and again [/System:Color]to relive the\nthrill of the fight and try to earn better rewards.
141	If you're fighting as a [System:Color name=tutorial ]party of more than one team[/System:Color],\neven if one of the teams ends up incapacitated,\nyou can continue to fight by helping your allies up.
142	[System:Color name=tutorial ]When at least one of the bars of the Party Gauge is full[/System:Color],\nyou can approach an incapacitated character and press\n[System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=A ][/System:Color] to revive them and [System:Color name=tutorial ]help them up[/System:Color].
143	When a team contains more than one Blade, you can\npress [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=left ][/System:Color] (both in battle or when exploring) to perform\na [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Switch[/System:Color].
144	This is particularly important when fighting, as doing\nso lets you select [System:Color name=tutorial ]which Blade will participate in battle[/System:Color],\nbe it in Vanguard or Rear Guard position.
145	Unlike switching Blades while out and about,\nswitching Blades in battle involves a [System:Color name=tutorial ]cooldown [/System:Color]period\nduring which you won't be able to switch.
146	If you're fighting as a party of more than one team,\nyou can [System:Color name=tutorial ]issue orders to the other teams[/System:Color]. To do so,\nhold down [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=R ][/System:Color] and press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=left ][/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=up ][/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=right ][/System:Color], or [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=down ][/System:Color].
147	[System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=R ][/System:Color]+[System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=up ][/System:Color]: [System:Color name=tutorial ]Focus attacks[/System:Color] on currently-targeted enemy.\n[System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=R ][/System:Color]+[System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=down ][/System:Color]: [System:Color name=tutorial ]Call other teams to gather [/System:Color]near the team you're\ncurrently controlling.
148	[System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=R ][/System:Color]+[System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=left ][/System:Color]: Fight while [System:Color name=tutorial ]prioritizing Driver Combos[/System:Color].\n[System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=R ][/System:Color]+[System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=right ][/System:Color]: Fight while [System:Color name=tutorial ]prioritizing Blade Combos[/System:Color].
149	Some characters have a [System:Color name=tutorial ]blue question mark icon [/System:Color]above\ntheir head. Speak to them, and they'll give you a\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]quest[/System:Color], asking you to do something for them.
150	After accepting the quest, you can set it as your\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]active quest [/System:Color]to display its next objective(s) as\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]blue exclamation mark icon(s) [/System:Color]on the [System:Color name=tutorial ]compass[/System:Color].
151	Completing quests will yield various rewards,\nsuch as [System:Color name=tutorial ]items[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]gold[/System:Color], and [System:Color name=tutorial ]Bonus EXP[/System:Color]. It will also\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]increase your companions' Trust[/System:Color].
152	Titans, the great continents of Alrest, are living beings,\nand one of the waste products they generate manifests\nas [System:Color name=tutorial ]ether miasma[/System:Color].
153	Ether miasma tends to attract monsters, so [System:Color name=tutorial ]removing it[/System:Color]\nisn't the safest of occupations. It is, however, rewarding,\nas doing so [System:Color name=tutorial ]unlocks a new collection point [/System:Color]each time.
154	Clearing away the miasma requires the right [System:Color name=tutorial ]Field Skills[/System:Color].\nThese can be acquired and improved by unlocking the\nright nodes on Blades' Affinity Charts.
155	Each of your party characters has [System:Color name=tutorial ]a unique Art [/System:Color]that\nonly they can use, called a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Talent Art[/System:Color].
156	If you meet the requirements for activating it, you can\npress [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=right ][/System:Color] to do so. To check the conditions and effects\nof Talent Arts, [System:Color name=tutorial ]visit the Enhance Arts menu[/System:Color].
157	Talent Arts have [System:Color name=tutorial ]very powerful effects[/System:Color], but can come\nwith [System:Color name=tutorial ]significant downsides [/System:Color]as well. Be sure to consider\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]when and how to use them [/System:Color]to get the most benefit.
158	[System:Color name=tutorial ]Attacking[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]healing [/System:Color]your team, and other actions which\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]your foes consider undesirable [/System:Color]will make the characters\nperforming them accrue a value called [System:Color name=tutorial ]aggro[/System:Color].
159	Aggro is accumulated [System:Color name=tutorial ]individually by each team[/System:Color], and\nenemies will [System:Color name=tutorial ]attack the team with the highest aggro[/System:Color].
160	Try to manage your aggro so that teams with low HP\nor ones with low defense values [System:Color name=tutorial ]don't get targeted[/System:Color].\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Reining in attacks [/System:Color]for a time is a useful technique.
161	The [System:Color name=tutorial ]goodwill Lora and her friends create[/System:Color] is known\nas [System:Color name=tutorial ]Community[/System:Color].
162	The foundation of Community is talking to the many\nand various inhabitants of Alrest. Speak to a person,\nand you'll learn their name, job, and location.
163	You can always check this information by going to\nthe [System:Color name=tutorial ]Community [/System:Color]menu, [System:Color name=tutorial ]found in the Main Menu[/System:Color].\nTalk to everyone you can and expand your Community!
164	Resolve an issue that a person listed in the Community\nmenu is struggling with, and they'll give you a token of\ntheir support for you.
165	Collect a lot, and your [System:Color name=tutorial ]Community will grow stronger[/System:Color]!\nRaising the Community level will cause [System:Color name=tutorial ]more quests\nto become available[/System:Color]. What comes around goes around!
166	Spreading the Community spirit lets Lora, Jin, and their\nallies make their mark on the world. Doing good for the\nbenefit of Alrest is its own reward!
167	Certain Arts and Switch Arts have the ability to inflict\ncertain [System:Color name=tutorial ]status changes on the enemy[/System:Color].
168	The four statuses are: [System:Color name=tutorial ]Break[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]Topple[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]Launch[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]Smash[/System:Color].\nInflicting them [System:Color name=tutorial ]in that order[/System:Color], starting with Break, is\ncalled a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Driver Combo[/System:Color].
169	From Topple onward, inflicting the status will cause\nfoes to drop HP Potions, and they won't fight back.\nYou can use this to your advantage in battle!
170	Level 4 Specials are extremely powerful, and there's\na certain trick to pulling one off.
171	With the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Special gauge charged up to level 3[/System:Color],\nmoving the Driver [System:Color name=tutorial ]close to [/System:Color]the Blade will cause\nthe gauge to fill up further.
172	Once it fills all the way, the [System:Color name=tutorial ]level 4 Special is ready[/System:Color].\nHowever, if the Driver and Blade move [System:Color name=tutorial ]too far apart[/System:Color],\nthe [System:Color name=tutorial ]gauge will deplete [/System:Color]and you'll have to start over.
173	[System:Color name=tutorial ]Hitting an enemy with a Special [/System:Color]begins a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blade Combo.[/System:Color]\nA Blade Combo consists of three stages, and [System:Color name=tutorial ]finishing[/System:Color]\nit requires you to [System:Color name=tutorial ]move through them in order[/System:Color].
174	The [System:Color name=tutorial ]first, second, and third [/System:Color]stages of a Blade Combo\nrequire you to hit the enemy with a Special that's\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]at least level 1, 2, and 3 respectively [/System:Color]to link them up.
175	You can also link up [System:Color name=tutorial ]other team's Specials[/System:Color]. When a\nteam can use a Special, a [System:Color name=tutorial ]combo request [/System:Color]will appear on\nthe screen for you to [System:Color name=tutorial ]give the order[/System:Color]. Think carefully!
176	You can continue a Blade Combo [System:Color name=tutorial ]all the way to stage 3[/System:Color]\nwith [System:Color name=tutorial ]Specials of any element[/System:Color], as long as you keep to the\nlevel requirements, but there are some fixed routes.
177	These [System:Color name=tutorial ]critical routes [/System:Color]number [System:Color name=tutorial ]16 in total[/System:Color], and they're\ncomposed of a particular sequence of elements.\nFor example, one such route is [System:Color name=tutorial ]Fire [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Fire [/System:Color]> [System:Color name=tutorial ]Light[/System:Color].
178	A finished critical route will trigger a [System:Color name=tutorial ]special animation\n[/System:Color]and [System:Color name=tutorial ]cause extra damage[/System:Color], so be on the lookout for the\nother 15 special element sequences!
179	Contributing to a Blade Combo will cause [System:Color name=tutorial ]element orbs\n[/System:Color]to start orbiting the enemy. You can then destroy them\nand [System:Color name=tutorial ]inflict other special effects [/System:Color]by using a [System:Color name=tutorial ]Chain Attack[/System:Color].
180	Press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=plus ] [/System:Color]when your Party Gauge has [System:Color name=tutorial ]all three bars full[/System:Color]\nto launch an attack sequence where teams take turns\nhitting the foe, and an element orb, with Specials.
181	When an orb is hit [System:Color name=tutorial ]three times[/System:Color], it will be destroyed.\nA [System:Color name=tutorial ]Special of the opposite element [/System:Color]to an orb on the\nenemy will [System:Color name=tutorial ]count for two hits[/System:Color]. This last part is key!
182	Destroying an orb has a lot of nice effects: it [System:Color name=tutorial ]extends\nthe Chain Attack[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]raises the damage bonus[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]fills up the\nFull Burst gauge[/System:Color], and [System:Color name=tutorial ]recharges used characters[/System:Color].
183	Normally in a Chain Attack, [System:Color name=tutorial ]each team will act once [/System:Color]and\nthat's it, but if you manage to [System:Color name=tutorial ]destroy an element orb[/System:Color],\nthe attack will be [System:Color name=tutorial ]extended by an extra round[/System:Color].
184	If you succeed in the [System:Color name=tutorial ]button challenge [/System:Color]that appears \nwhen the round is extended, the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Specials you use will\nget a level up [/System:Color]and be [System:Color name=tutorial ]recharged[/System:Color], so be ready for it!
185	When you launch a Chain Attack, the Party Gauge\nwill be replaced by the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Full Burst gauge [/System:Color]for the\nduration.
186	With each [System:Color name=tutorial ]element orb you destroy[/System:Color], the Full Burst\ngauge will [System:Color name=tutorial ]fill up a little[/System:Color]. If you can fill it [System:Color name=tutorial ]completely[/System:Color],\na Full Burst will trigger, dealing [System:Color name=tutorial ]massive damage[/System:Color].
187	Additionally, if you defeat an enemy during the\nChain Attack, Overkill will begin. Dealing more damage\nduring Overkill nets you extra [System:Color name=tutorial ]EXP[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]WP[/System:Color], and [System:Color name=tutorial ]SP[/System:Color].
188	Certain high-level enemies will [System:Color name=tutorial ]become enraged after\nlosing a certain amount of HP[/System:Color], which [System:Color name=tutorial ]boosts their stats[/System:Color].\nIt's best not to let some battles drag on...
189	Certain enemies awaken hidden abilities when [System:Color name=tutorial ]orbited\nby an element orb[/System:Color]. This [System:Color name=tutorial ]boosts their stats[/System:Color] as well as\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]shortening your Blade Combo effect durations[/System:Color].
190	This awakened status will be [System:Color name=tutorial ]removed once the\nelement orbs are gone[/System:Color], so use a Chain Attack to\nremove them whenever convenient.
191	Lora's Talent Art [System:Color name=tutorial ]sacrifices half of her HP [/System:Color]in order to\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]fully recharge all of her Arts[/System:Color]. If you're flush with HP,\nuse it and hammer the enemy with all you've got.
192	Jin's Talent Art lets him [System:Color name=tutorial ]temporarily boost his attack[/System:Color],\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]accuracy[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]evasion [/System:Color]and [System:Color name=tutorial ]speed [/System:Color]in proportion to [System:Color name=tutorial ]how much\nrecoverable HP [/System:Color]he has. More HP means bigger boost.
193	Haze's Talent Art [System:Color name=tutorial ]completely drains the charge on all\nof her Vanguard Arts [/System:Color]and in return [System:Color name=tutorial ]immobilizes enemies\nfor a time[/System:Color]. It's super powerful, but requires good timing.
194	Team Lora is a [System:Color name=tutorial ]well-rounded group proficient at both\nattacking and healing[/System:Color]. When you're new to the game\nor struggling in battle, this is a good team to go with.
195	Leading with Lora's [System:Color name=tutorial ]Hungry Snake [/System:Color]Art, then quickly\nVanguard Switching to Jin to inflict Topple is a strong\nplay. Low on HP? Vanguard Switch to [System:Color name=tutorial ]Haze and heal[/System:Color].
196	Addam's Talent Art [System:Color name=tutorial ]trades HP [/System:Color]for a [System:Color name=tutorial ]longer window of\nopportunity for Driver Combos[/System:Color]. It's just what you need\nwhen you're shooting for that Driver Combo finisher.
197	Mythra's Talent Art is useful when the [System:Color name=tutorial ]party's in\ntrouble[/System:Color]. It allows the [System:Color name=tutorial ]whole party to evade a certain\nnumber of attacks[/System:Color], giving you a chance to turn the tide.
198	Minoth's Talent Art can be used [System:Color name=tutorial ]at maximum Affinity[/System:Color].\nIt [System:Color name=tutorial ]doubles the next Art's damage, and triples the aggro[/System:Color].\nUsing it too often can bring too much heat to handle.
199	Team Addam [System:Color name=tutorial ]excels on the offense[/System:Color]. Use mighty Arts\nand Specials in succession to make short work of foes.\nThe defense is lacking, though, so [System:Color name=tutorial ]watch the aggro[/System:Color].
200	Use Addam's [System:Color name=tutorial ]Rising Arc [/System:Color]Art on a Toppled enemy, then\nVanguard Switch to Mythra for a quick and easy Smash.\nThis will deal huge damage, and spawn HP Potions too.
201	Hugo's Talent Art [System:Color name=tutorial ]costs a portion of his HP [/System:Color]and [System:Color name=tutorial ]forces\nenemies to target him for a while[/System:Color]. Using Guard Shift\nright after is a strong defensive move.
202	Brighid's Talent Art can be used [System:Color name=tutorial ]when her health is low[/System:Color].\nIt [System:Color name=tutorial ]damages foes while empowering her allies' attacks[/System:Color].\nThere's no cost to it, so use it whenever your HP is low.
203	Aegaeon's Talent Art is great [System:Color name=tutorial ]when you're struggling[/System:Color].\nFor a time, [System:Color name=tutorial ]you'll counterattack when you evade[/System:Color].\nPair it with [System:Color name=tutorial ]Breaking Wave [/System:Color]and watch foes drop.
204	Team Hugo [System:Color name=tutorial ]excels at defense[/System:Color], evading and blocking\nenemy attacks with ease. Their role is to [System:Color name=tutorial ]focus enemy\naggro on themselves and protect their allies[/System:Color].
205	Brighid has Support Arts that reduce enemy defense,\nwhile Aegaeon's can empower the vanguard. [System:Color name=tutorial ]Switching\nbetween Blades to match the situation [/System:Color]is important.
206	You can press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=X ][/System:Color] on the Character screen to [System:Color name=tutorial ]change\nparty order[/System:Color]. Controlling each team feels [System:Color name=tutorial ]different[/System:Color], so be\nsure to find one that [System:Color name=tutorial ]matches your own play style[/System:Color].
207	You might find certain mysterious stone pillars on your\nadventures, called [System:Color name=tutorial ]Barney Stones[/System:Color]. They're a feature\nthat's unique to Torna.
208	Checking out a Barney Stone means [System:Color name=tutorial ]you'll have to\nfight off some monsters[/System:Color], but if you can manage it,\nyou'll get some [System:Color name=tutorial ]hidden treasure[/System:Color]. Preparation is key!
209	A [System:Color name=tutorial ]Seeker [/System:Color]is an item which [System:Color name=tutorial ]Hugo can craft[/System:Color]. With it,\nyou'll be able to investigate the [System:Color name=tutorial ]old machines [/System:Color]strewn\naround the world and obtain [System:Color name=tutorial ]new kinds of Collectibles[/System:Color].
210	There are [System:Color name=tutorial ]two different kinds [/System:Color]of Seeker, and each lets\nyou investigate a [System:Color name=tutorial ]different kind of machine[/System:Color]. It's worth\ngetting both, then gathering all the Collectibles you can!
211	About Xenoblade Chronicles 2
212	Drivers
213	Blades
214	A [System:Color name=tutorial ]Driver [/System:Color]is someone who can awaken the lifeforms\nknown as [System:Color name=tutorial ]Blades [/System:Color]from [System:Color name=tutorial ]Core Crystals[/System:Color]. Bonding with\na Blade in this way is known as [System:Color name=tutorial ]resonating[/System:Color].
215	Not everyone has the potential to become a Driver,\nand those who do play an important role in the military\nand political affairs of Alrest.
216	Lora became a Driver when she resonated with Jin.\nDrivers and their Blades share a powerful bond\nand in most cases spend their whole lives together.
217	[System:Color name=tutorial ]Blades[/System:Color] are lifeforms born from the mysterious\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]Core Crystals[/System:Color].
218	Blades are born alongside a weapon that could\nbe considered part of their being. They wield this\nweapon in battle.
219	Blades are functionally immortal as long as\ntheir Core Crystal remains intact and their\nDriver remains alive.
220	Blade Affinity Charts
221	When you get an [System:Color name=tutorial ]Affinity Reward[/System:Color] for fulfilling a\ncondition on a Blade's [System:Color name=tutorial ]Affinity Chart[/System:Color], you'll get\na [System:Color name=tutorial ]pop-up[/System:Color] notification.
222	The Affinity Reward itself won't be unlocked\nat this point, though, so you won't notice any\ndifference just yet.
223	When you get the Affinity Reward pop-up,\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]be sure to check the unlocked ability in the menu[/System:Color].\nIf you don't, the Blade won't develop.
224	Engaging [System:Color name=tutorial ]Overdrive [/System:Color]is a special ability that Elma has.\nTo use it, press [System:Color name=tutorial ][ML:icon icon=R ] and [ML:icon icon=minus ] [/System:Color]with Elma on the battlefield.\nDoing this requires a [System:Color name=tutorial ]fully filled Party Gauge[/System:Color].
225	[System:Color name=tutorial ]Hit with Arts while Overdrive is engaged[/System:Color], and the hits\nwill be counted on the [System:Color name=tutorial ]Overdrive Counter [/System:Color]in the middle\nof the screen. Hits with [System:Color name=tutorial ]Specials count at a 5x rate[/System:Color].
226	You can gain [System:Color name=tutorial ]three kinds of bonuses [/System:Color]by raising the\nhit count: [System:Color name=tutorial ]damage boost[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]recharge boost[/System:Color],[System:Color name=tutorial ] lower enemy\nresistance[/System:Color]. The effect increases with the hit count.
227	You can increase the [System:Color name=tutorial ]duration [/System:Color]of Overdrive by filling up\nthe entire Party Gauge while Overdrive is engaged, and\nthen [System:Color name=tutorial ]activating Overdrive again[/System:Color].
228	However, [System:Color name=tutorial ]while Overdrive is in effect[/System:Color], [System:Color name=tutorial ]Party Gauge gain\nis reduced[/System:Color], and you [System:Color name=tutorial ]can't use Chain Attacks[/System:Color]. Be mindful\nof the downsides as you think of the best time to use it!
229	Tracking Community
230	You can [System:Color name=tutorial ]gain Community[/System:Color] from people with\n[System:Color name=tutorial ]yellow icons above their head[/System:Color] just by [System:Color name=tutorial ]talking\nto them[/System:Color]. You don't have to complete a quest.
