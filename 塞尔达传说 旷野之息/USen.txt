Demo101_0_Text038	To know Calamity Ganon's true form, one must\nknow the story from an age long past. \x0e\0\x04\0The demon king was born into this kingdom, but his\ntransformation into Malice created the horror you\nsee now.
Demo101_0_Text039	Stories of Ganon were passed from generation to\ngeneration in the form of legends and fairy tales.\x0e\0\x04\0But there was also...a prophecy.
Demo101_0_Text040	"The signs of a resurrection of\nCalamity Ganon are clear. \x0e\0\x04\0And the power to oppose it lies\ndormant beneath the ground."
Demo101_0_Text057	We decided to heed the prophecy and began\nexcavating large areas of land. \x0e\0\x04\0It wasn't long before we discovered several ancient\nrelics made by the hands of our distant ancestors.
Demo101_0_Text042	These relics, the Divine Beasts, were giant machines\npiloted by warriors.\x0e\0\x04\0We also found the Guardians, an army of mechanical\nsoldiers who fought autonomously.
Demo101_0_Text054	This coincided with ancient legends, oft repeated\nthroughout our land.
Demo101_0_Text055	We also learned of a princess with a sacred power\nand her appointed knight, chosen by the sword that\nseals the darkness. \x0e\0\x04\0It was they who sealed Ganon away using the power\nof these ancient relics.
Demo101_0_Text056	One hundred years ago, there was a princess\nset to inherit a sacred power and a skilled knight\nat her side.\x0e\0\x04\0It was clear that we must follow our ancestors' path.
Demo101_0_Text065	We selected four skilled individuals from across\nHyrule and tasked them with the duty of piloting the\nDivine Beasts.
Demo101_0_Text066	With the princess as their commander, we dubbed\nthese pilots Champions—\x0e\0\x04\0a name that would solidify their unique bond.
Demo101_0_Text046	The princess, her appointed knight, and the rest\nof the Champions were on the brink of sealing\naway Ganon...
Demo101_0_Text047	But nay...\x0e\0\x04\0Ganon was cunning, and he responded with a plan\nbeyond our imagining.
Demo101_0_Text048	He appeared from deep below Hyrule Castle,\nseized control of the Guardians and the\nDivine Beasts,\x0e\0\x04\0and turned them against us.
Demo101_0_Text049	The Champions lost their lives. Those residing in the\ncastle as well.\x0e\0\x04\0The appointed knight, gravely wounded, collapsed\nwhile defending the princess...
Demo101_0_Text050	And thus, the kingdom of Hyrule was devastated\nabsolutely by Calamity Ganon.

Demo105_0_Text046	The Divine Beasts were piloted by four individuals\nof exceptional skill from across the land.\x0e\0\x04\0And thus, the plan to neutralize Ganon was forged.

Demo105_1_Text055	And free-willed machines that hunted down their\nprey / These Guardians were built to last\nso they could join the fray.
Demo105_1_Text046	To guide the beasts in battle, warriors were needed,\nSo four Champions pledged to see Ganon defeated.
Demo105_1_Text056	Divine Beasts, Guardians, princess, and knight,\nTheir plan to rout Ganon was looking airtight.
Demo105_1_Text047	And when Calamity Ganon reared its head, Hyrule\nrose against it / The optimism of Hyrule all the more\nincensed it.
Demo105_1_Text057	Ganon raged in its assault, boiling with hate,\nIt gnashed its teeth and thrashed about, but\nit was all too late.
Demo105_1_Text048	The Guardians kept the heroes safe through every\nhour...
Demo105_1_Text058	The Divine Beasts unleashed attacks that\nweakened Ganon's power.
Demo105_1_Text049	The hero with the sealing sword struck the final blow,\nAnd the holy power of the princess sealed Ganon so.
Demo105_1_Text059	And that is the story of the brazen attack,\nOn Calamity Ganon 10,000 years back.

talk108	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x05\x10Unfortunately, I can't tell you what she\nwrote. \x0e\x05\0\0A gentleman would never read\na lady's letter to a stranger.\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x0bBut I CAN assure you that she writes in\nthe sweetest, most refined way ever.\x0e\x05\0\0\nShe must be a very elegant young lady.\nActually, as a Zora, she's probably a lot\nolder than me.\x0e\x05\0\0 That doesn't bother me\none bit, but...\x0e\x05\0\0I hope she feels the same.

talk116	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x05\x10This could work...\x0e\x05\x02\0 I guess I just have to\nstart pumping up my muscles now...

talk121	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\n\x15{s[125]}AHHH!!{s[100]}\n\n\nI worked SO hard on that letter! \x0e\x05\x02\0And now\nI have to write ANOTHER one?\n\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x01*sigh* Oh, well. \n\n\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\tAfter all, they say the more you have\nto struggle for love, the sweeter it is.\x0e\x05\0\0\nHee hee, yeah... \x0e\x05\x01\0That must be true.
talk122	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x0eOK! \x0e\x05\0\0It's time for me to take a chance\nand try to meet her...\n\nOh, that reminds me...\x0e\x05\0\0 I wonder if the\ntorrential rain has stopped.\x0e\0\x04\0She's waiting in \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0Zora's Domain\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.\x0e\x05\x01\0\nThat's what her letter says, anyway.\n\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x0bSo I'll achieve two goals at the same\ntime and train up my muscles on\nthe way there!

Talk_ZoraRelief_Mess_01	History of the Zora, Part One\nThe Eternal Zora's Domain\nAs told by King Dorephan\nThe rains have blessed Lanayru since\nancient times with an abundance of\npure, clean water.\nSeeking a bounty of such water, the Zora\ngathered there. Thus, as the legends go,\nthe domain was born 10,000 years ago.\nThe land was also rich in ore, and so a\nunique form of stonemasonry was\ndeveloped to create our new home.\nThe domain is one giant sculpture,\na feat of architecture that has drawn\nadmirers the world over.\nOur great domain will ever stand as a\nhallmark of the esteemed artists who\nmade it, an eternal symbol of Zora pride.
Talk_ZoraRelief_Mess_02	History of the Zora, Part Two\nA Reservoir of Hope\nAs told by King Dorephan\nOnce every 10 years, the Lanayru region\nexperiences unusually heavy rainfall.\nThe Zora River flooded every time.\nThe tides damaged not only our domain\nbut our people, washing away poor souls\nand causing great suffering and disarray.\nThe Zora king of that time, after seeking\naid from the king of Hyrule, rode out to\nsee what could be done.\nBy joining the architectural genius of the\nZora and Hyrule's technological prowess,\nEast Reservoir Lake was swiftly built.\nThanks to this fruitful partnership,\nHyrule was no longer plagued by\nthese devastating floods.\nIn gratitude, the Zora king promised the\nking of Hyrule to manage the reservoir\nlevel to protect all of Hyrule from floods.\nEach Zora king since has kept that oath,\nspanning 10,000 years. That is why the\nreservoir signifies our bond with Hyrule.
Talk_ZoraRelief_Mess_03	History of the Zora, Part Three\nMiracle of the White Scale\nAs told by King Dorephan\nOur scholars say that in the distant past,\nZora's Domain had a king with no special\ntalent for the art of war.\nWhat he lacked in skill with a blade,\nhe made up for in love for his people,\nand especially love for his queen.\nOne day, news reached the king of a\nhorde of monsters gathering in the\nZodobon Highlands.\nThe king steeled himself for war to\nprotect his people, but the queen knew\nhow ill suited for the task he was.\nWorried for his life, she wove one of her\nown scales into his armor, hoping that\nher love would protect him in battle.\nIt seemed for a time that the tide of\nbattle favored the Zora and that all\nwould make it safely home.\nBut the cunning Lizalfos general saw\nan opening and seized it, driving the\nking's forces into a corner.\nJust when the general's sword was ready\nto crash down upon the king, a miracle\ntook place.\nAn errant sunbeam reflected from the\nscale on his armor blinded the Lizalfos,\nstopping the deathblow from falling.\nThis was the chance the king needed to\nrally his forces and turn the tide, taking\ndown the general and securing victory.\nThis came to be known as the Miracle of\nthe White Scale, a scale that only female\nZora possess.\nIt was this miracle that began the\ntradition of Zora princesses crafting\narmor for their future husbands.
Talk_ZoraRelief_Mess_04	History of the Zora, Part Four\nThe Lightscale Trident\nAs told by King Dorephan\nThe queen and I were blessed with\na daughter as lovely as a jewel.\nWe named our princess...Mipha.\nTo celebrate her birth, the smithy Dento\npresented Mipha with a gift: a mighty\nspear called the Lightscale Trident.\nMipha grew into a bright girl and soon\nreached the age of receiving lessons\nfrom the royal family's order of knights.\nThe whole of the royal guard adored her,\nespecially Sergeant Seggin, who loved\nher as if she were his own kin.\nUnder Seggin's instruction, Mipha honed\nher skills, and her radiance grew along\nwith her skill with the Lightscale Trident.\nAs a Champion, Mipha made her people\nproud. However, once the Great Calamity\nstruck, she was never to return.\nAll of Zora's Domain fell into misery.\nThe merest thought of the princess was\nenough to overcome anyone with tears.\nAs a way of offering her soul repose,\nthey tried to send the Lightscale Trident\ndrifting down the Zora River.\nBut when they did, the trident began to\nglow, and Mipha's voice rang loud and\nclear for all Zora to hear:\n"The Lightscale Trident and I are one...\nAbandon your grief and know joy once\nagain. Do not cry...just remember."\nAnd so, keeping to her request, on the\nday of the Great Calamity...the day that\nMipha passed from this world...\nthe Zora venerate the Lightscale Trident\nand remember their brave princess.\n\nSuch is the origin of the\nChampion Festival.
Talk_ZoraRelief_Mess_05	History of the Zora, Part Five\nThe Sage Princess Ruto\nAs told by King Dorephan\nLong, long ago... In a past more distant\nthan even the Great Calamity or the\ncreation of the Divine Beast Vah Ruta...\nThere was a Zora princess named Ruto.\n\n\nWe know that she was an attendant to\nthe Zora patron deity and that she was\na fair and lively girl, beloved to all.\nAround that same time, an evil man with\ndesigns on ruling the world appeared,\nbringing disaster upon Zora's Domain.\nIt is said that Ruto then awoke as a sage,\nfacing this foe alongside the princess of\nHyrule and the hero of legend.\nHer achievements are remembered not\nonly by the Zora, they are also forever\netched in the history of Hyrule.\nThe Divine Beast Vah Ruta, built ages\nlater to face off against Calamity Ganon,\nwas named in honor of Ruto.\nThat the Zora princess—my sweet\ndaughter Mipha—was chosen to\npilot Ruta is surely the work of fate.
Talk_ZoraRelief_Mess_06	History of the Zora, Part Six\nDivine Beast Vah Ruta\nAs told by King Dorephan\nWhen the Divine Beast Vah Ruta was\nfirst discovered at Zora's Domain,\nmy daughter Mipha hurried to see it.\nThose present that day say they saw an\nunusual sparkle of excitement in Mipha's\nnormally calm eyes as she beheld Ruta.\nThe princess spoke of the Divine Beast\nas she would a friend and was overjoyed\nwhen she was chosen to pilot Ruta.\nI thought nothing of it at the time,\nbut given the events that followed,\nI now regret allowing this to happen.\nI have spent many long years consumed\nby guilt. My dearest wish is that her soul\nwill know peace. I pray for it every day.
Talk_ZoraRelief_Mess_07	History of the Zora, Addendum 1\nKing Dorephan Stands His Ground\n\nAround 100 years after King Dorephan\nascended to the throne, a stray Guardian\ncrossed Upland Zorana into our domain.\nThe Guardian seemed unstoppable.\nOur best soldiers' spears barely left\na scratch on its metal hull.\nIt was then that our King Dorephan,\nwithout a thought for his own safety,\ncame out to face the Guardian himself.\nWith supernatural strength, he lifted the\nGuardian and hurled it into a ravine.\n\nThe impact of the fall left the Guardian\nin pieces, and it was never to trouble\nanother Zora ever again.\nThe citizens celebrated the king's valor.\nFrom then on, their trust and respect for\nhim grew beyond compare.\nYou can still see the scar he earned\nthat day on his forehead—a token of\nhis triumph.

Talk_ZoraRelief_Mess_09	History of the Zora, Addendum 2\nPrince Sidon's Great Escape\n\nThere was once a giant Octorok in\nHateno Bay, large as a mountain,\nwhich terrorized the village's fishers.\nHearing of their distress, Prince Sidon\nwent forth to personally eliminate the\noffending Octorok.\nBut this Octorok was a tricky beast.\nAfter the prince dodged one of the\nstones it spat, it inhaled him whole.\nSuch had been the fate of many strong\nwarriors who went to slay the Octorok.\nNot one had come back alive.\nJust as it seemed Prince Sidon would be\ncounted among them, the giant Octorok\ntwisted in pain.\nThe tip of a silverscale spear pierced the\nOctorok's stomach from within, revealing\nitself as the source of the beast's agony.\nIncredibly, Prince Sidon had fought his\nway out by stabbing his spear over and\nover into the monster's stomach.\nUnable to bear the pain, the Octorok\ncoughed up the prince and scrambled\nto escape.\nEver since, the fishers of Hateno Bay\nhave passed down this heroic tale:\nThe Prince Who Slew the Fell Octorok
Talk_ZoraRelief_Mess_10	Memoir of a Gifted Stonemason\n\n\nWhat an honor it was to receive a\npersonal request from King Dorephan\nto craft a historical stone monument!\nI did not realize how much content he'd\ngive me, though... It certainly exceeded\nthe line limits of a single monument.\nI suppose I could have just shortened\nthe text, but it felt wrong to tamper with\nour great king's words.\nThankfully, I was able to split it all\nbetween seven monuments to ensure\nthat every word was preserved.\nI have always prided myself on my ability\nto think outside the box. I am so very\nadaptable! And humble as well.\nWhile I was at it, I thought...why not add\ntwo of my own? And so I created one for\nKing Dorephan and one for Prince Sidon.\nTrue, this is outside the scope of my\ncommission... But I believe their triumphs\ndeserve as much! But why stop at that...\nWhy, indeed! My achievement surely\ndeserves remembrance too. That is how\na commission of one became 10.\nOf course, having increased the number\nof monuments, I had to find places for\nthem all... That proved difficult.\nStill, it is worth it! So long as I remember\nto sign these monuments, my name will\nbe remembered forever. As it should be.

Talk00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\x04Prissen! Hang on!
Talk01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x06\0I've got the scoop on Misko's \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0treasure\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ,\nand it's great! Listen up, Dak...
Talk18	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x02\x01Hey, buddy! What's your problem?\x0e\x05\0\0 You\naren't being incredibly rude and listening\nto our conversation, are you?
Talk19	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x02\0We're treasure hunters, on the trail of\nour latest score... The\x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0 treasure of the\ngreat bandit Misko\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ!\x0e\x05\0\0 It's as good as ours!
Talk02	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x02\x0ePrissen! You're going to give it all away!
Talk03	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\t\0Sorry, Dak... \x0e\x05\0\0I got carried away.
Talk04	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x02\0Anyway, we're busy here, dude.\nIf you need something, take it up\nwith someone else.
Talk05	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x02\0You again? Pay no mind to my little bro's\nchatter from before. He's got a penchant\nfor running his mouth with crazy talk.\x0e\x01\x04\x06\0\0\x01\0\0\x01
0000	So... Misko's treasure?
0001	I...see.
Talk06	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\x0fAhhh shoot. Welp. Can't say I didn't try\nto throw him off...
Talk07	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x02\0Anyway. Misko's treasure—not that we\nwere talking about such a thing—is only\nfor the BEST of treasure hunters. \nThat probably rules you out, bub.\n\n\n{s[080]}The fewer people after it, the better.\nAnd we've still got the scoop!{s[100]}
Talk08	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x06\0Hey, Dak... Why don't we just tell him?\nMaybe he'll leave us alone if we do.\n\nI mean, if we can't figure this riddle out,\nthere's no way someone like him will be\nable to.
Talk09	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\0...That's a good point.\n\n
Talk22	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x02\0\x0e\x05\x01\0We're after nothing less than the\n\x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0treasure of Misko, the Great Bandit\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ!\nFinding it would mean incredible riches...\nI'm not about to give this information\naway for free. I'm no fool!
Talk20	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x07\0That's the keen sense of the strongest\ntreasure hunter at work! No gold left\nbehind—not by Domidak!\nYou're great, Dak!
Talk17	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x02\x04It'll be \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0100 rupees\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ to learn what\nwe know.\n\nTruth is, it'd be a steal to get this\nexclusive scoop for \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\01,000 rupees\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ...\x0e\x05\x01\0\nSo what do you say?\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x02\0\x03\0\0\x01
0002	Deal!
0003	No way!
Talk10	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\tHeh.\x0e\x05\x02\0 Good deal.
Talk11	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x02\0Well, I've got nothing to say to some\nbum without even two rupees to rub\ntogether.
Talk12	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x07\0Way to go, Dak. You did it!
Talk13	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x02\0Misko hid the location of the treasure in\nsome kind of strange secret code.\n\nI heard this from a former dog walker of\none of Misko's underling's descendant's\nneighbors. As solid a lead as any.
Talk14	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x07\x01Just knowing someone with good intel\nlike that? Exactly what I'd expect from\nyou, Dak!
Talk15	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x02\x07But this riddle has even I, Domidak,\nthe premier treasure hunter,\nscratching my head.\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0So that you can tell how challenging my\nwork is, \x0e\x05\x01\0I'll tell it to you. \x0e\x05\x01\0You'll never\nsolve it, though.
Talk16	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0The little twin steps over the little river.\nMy cave rests above that river's source.
near00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\0Hrm...
near01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\0I bet it's over there!

0003	Sure, I'm game.
0004	Prove it how?
0005	I've nothing to prove.
0001_00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x05\x10Hm...\x0e\x05\x01\0 I don't like the sound of that.\nThe monsters out this way are strong\ncritters.\nYou're sure you don't want to \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0drill\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ with\nme some?\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x03\0\x06\0\x05\0\0\x02
0006	How do you mean?
0002_00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x03\x0cMy apologies, then. \x0e\x05\0\0I didn't mean to\nspeak out of turn. \x0e\x05\x01\0Happy trails and\nstraight shooting, young man.
GameInit_00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0They say youth breeds impulsiveness,\nbut it's that kind of quick certainty that'll\nsave your hide.\x0e\x05\x01\0 Maybe someday soon.
GameInit_01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Now...\x0e\x05\x01\0I'm loath to ask, but would you\nmind forking over \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\020 rupees \x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿto cover\nsome of my costs?\x0e\x01\x04\x06\t\0\n\0\0\x01

GameInit_04	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\x10Young man... \x0e\x05\0\0A straight shooter checks\nhis wallet before he antes up, not after.\x0e\x05\x01\0\nSort yourself out, and come back later.

Explanation_00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x06Ever heard of \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0horseback archery\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ?\x0e\x05\x01\0 They\ninvented it way out east somewhere.\x0e\0\x04\0It takes a lot of coordination to shoot\ntargets with a bow and arrow from the\nback of a galloping horse.\nI expect you'll run into mounted\nvarmints now and again, so this'll be a\ngood way to get some practice in.
Explanation_01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Tell you what...\x0e\x05\x01\0 You break \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0more than 20\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ\ntargets, and I'll hand over my \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0horse gear\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.

0007	I do.
0008	Go over it again.
GameInit_06	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x0bGood thinking.\x0e\x05\x01\0 Keep it up and you might\nlive to be my age.
NoHouse	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\0Now...\x0e\x05\0\0for a young man interested in\nhorseback archery, you seem to be in\nwant of a horse. \x0e\x05\x01\0That's no way to \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0drill\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.
WildHouse_00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\0Hm...\x0e\x05\0\0 That horse of yours doesn't look\n\x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0registered\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ to me. Can't have you \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0drill\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ\non an unregistered horse.\nAny ideas?\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x0b\0\x0c\0\0\x02
0011	I'll register this one.
0012	I'll call my own horse.
MyHouse_00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x04Suit yourself. \x0e\x05\0\0We'll see how well you and\nyour horse act as a team on the field.
Register_00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x0bSounds like the right call to me.
Register_01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Head down that path there, and you\nought to come across a \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0stable\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.\x0e\0\x04\0They'll \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0register\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ your horse for you so\nyou can come back and drill here.
Accompany_00	I'd agree that training with your trusty\nhorse is a smart move anytime.
Accompany_01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Head down that path there, and you\nought to come across a \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0stable\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.\x0e\x05\x01\0 Fetch\nyour steed from them if you got one.
Accompany_02	Get a horse, mount up, then come talk\nto me \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0while you're riding high in the\nsaddle\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.
GameReady_00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0All right. \x0e\x05\0\0Then c'mere, young man.
GameReady_05	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04I'll explain a bit before we get started.
GameReady_06	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0You need a refresher on how this drill\nworks?\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x11\0\x12\0\0\x02
GameReady_01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0You see the \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0targets \x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿfloating out there?\x0e\x05\0\0\nI'll judge your skill by \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0how many of 'em\nyou pop with your arrows\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.
GameReady_02	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Don't you worry about when time's up.\x0e\x05\0\0\nI'll let you know.\x0e\x05\0\0 Until then, ride hard\nand shoot straight.\nSuppose this goes without saying,\nbut you get off your horse, and we're\ndone here.\nNo way to practice shooting from\nhorseback when you're standing around\non foot, after all.
GameReady_04	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04Figure I've said my piece now.\x0e\x05\0\0 Time we\ngot started.\x0e\x05\x01\0 Best of luck, young man.
GameReady_07	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Figure it's time we got started. \x0e\x05\0\0Best of\nluck, young man.

After01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\0The most reliable tip I've heard for\nmeeting him is to hang around a \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0skull-\nshaped lake \x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿout near Akkala.
After02	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x01He's been sighted all over the place now,\nnot just Akkala. \x0e\x05\0\0Should I be worried?\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\0The creepiest part of the stories is how\nhe's supposed to pop up out of nowhere\nonce night falls.\nI'm not as sure as I used to be that I\nactually want to meet him...
Talk00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\x06So you're probably wondering what that\nstuff is.
Talk00_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\x06I see you've got some monster extract.\x0e\x05\x01\0\nDo you know where to find \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0Kilton\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ and his\n\x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0Fang and Bone\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ, then?
Talk01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0It's called monster extract.\x0e\x05\x01\0 A guy\nnamed \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0Kilton\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ brews this stuff up at\n\x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0Fang and Bone\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.\nIt's a kind of flavoring that makes any\nfood taste amazing.\x0e\x05\0\0 I know it's made of\nmonsters, but it's good stuff.
Talk01_01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\0There are some weird stories going\naround about that Kilton character.\x0e\x05\0\0\nHe's obsessed with monsters.\nThey say he does all kinds of hair-raising\nresearch with them and came up with\na bunch of strange stuff as a result.\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0I kind of want to meet him at least once\nto see if the rumors are true, but he's\na hard guy to track down.

Talk03	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x06Huh! And here I thought he was more\nobscure than that.\x0e\x05\0\0 Well, I'll tell you what\nlittle I know. Take this for helping me.
Talk04	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x06Are you interested in finding out more?\nI could use some help with the hunt.\nTake this, too, for helping me.
Talk05	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\0One source I trust says he's most often\nfound at a \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0\x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0skull-shaped lake\x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0 \x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿin Akkala,\nbut I don't know the place.
Talk06	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04Apparently, he shows up after dark\nwhere you least expect him. \x0e\x05\0\0It could\nbe anywhere in the world.\nBut mark my words...I'll find him\nsomeday!
Talk07	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\n\0You've MET him?! Lucky you!

Talk08	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\t\0I'm so embarrassed you had to rescue\nme AGAIN. Ugh.\x0e\x05\0\0 Anyway...\n\nI haven't given up the search for that\nKilton guy and his \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0Fang and Bone\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ, but I\nhaven't gotten anywhere yet either.

Npc_HighMountain036_003	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x05\x01My youngest daughter, Kheel, wants to\ngo to \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0Warbler's Nest\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ. She won't stop\ntalking about it.\nI have five daughters, and ever since that\n\x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0beast \x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿappeared, they have been getting\nneedier by the minute.\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\t\0At times like this, I wish he was around...\n\n\nI wish I could be a kid again and think\nonly of myself.\n\nBut that is the thing about being a\nparent—you have to be bigger than your\nchildren.
Npc_HighMountain036_004	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Well, farewell. Take care of yourself.

Npc_HighMountain036_002_2	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x04\x13My apologies if that sounded like it was\nintended for you!

Npc_HighMountain036_023	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x01I hope that wasn't too personal a\nquestion.\n\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\t\x12When I cook dinner for my daughters, I\nsometimes wonder what the future holds\nfor this village...for my family.\nMy thoughts tend to grow a bit dark\nthen, but they lighten as soon as I\nsatisfy my hunger.\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0So go ahead and use the pot.\nA full stomach will do you well.
Npc_HighMountain036_024	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\tThere is no better feeling than cooking\na good meal for someone who means a\nlot to you.\nCooking a healthy meal for my daughters\nis one of my life's greatest joys.\n\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Perhaps you should use this pot to cook\na nice meal for your sweetheart.

Npc_HighMountain036_102	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\tIt sets my mind at ease to know where\nmy children are.

talk29	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x01Yes!

Talk05	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04You can cause a shock wave on the\nground just by swinging your sword\nwhile you're jumping.\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\0The higher up you are, the more damage\nyou'll do. \x0e\x05\x01\0However...\n\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0If you're TOO high up, you'll be the one\nwho takes damage.\n\nOnce you get the hang of this, it's quite\nuseful for surprise attacks on groups of\nenemies down below you.

Kikori00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x01I thought this tree here might make for\nsome good firewood.
Kikori01	\x0e\x04\x01\x02\x0bÍHowever...\x0e\x05\x01\0getting a tree to fall exactly\nwhere you want it to is quite an art.\n\nThe trick is to turn your hips so that they\nface where you want the tree to land.

0004	Ingredients?
0005	Combinations?
0006	Effects?
Cook04_Kotsu02	You can toss in anything edible.\nThankfully, there are plenty of\noptions in this area.\nJust remember that the more ingredients\nyou use in a dish, the more health it will\nreplenish when you eat it.
Cook04_Kotsu03	The idea is to mix heartier ingredients,\nlike fish and meat, with things like grains\nand vegetables.\nSpices and herbs help too, naturally.\nHowever...\x0e\x05\x01\0 Do not accidentally add in\nthings like bugs and lizards.\nLet's just say...they are not compatible.\nIn fact, they are quite foul.
Cook04_Kotsu04	Certain ingredients have special effects,\nsuch as temporarily warming you up or\nincreasing your stamina.\nIf you use them when cooking, even a\nnormal dish will be elevated to one with\na special effect.\n\x0e\x04\x01\x02\x02ÍDo note that combining bugs or lizards\nwith monster parts may yield some\nunexpected results.\nIn fact, \x0e\x05\x01\0that's how you make elixirs!
Cook05	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x01Well, I recommend you consider how the\ningredients will complement each other.\n\nBut don't let convention limit your\nculinary creativity!\x0e\x05\x01\0 \x0e\x04\x02\x18\x16\0C\0u\0s\0t\0o\0m\0L\0a\0u\0g\0h\0Oho ho!
Cook05_Vagrant004	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x01Try to consider how the ingredients will\ncomplement one another. You can even\nmake a dish that increases your stamina!\nIt's all about being creative\nand trying different things.\x0e\x05\x01\0\n\x0e\x04\x02\x18\x16\0C\0u\0s\0t\0o\0m\0L\0a\0u\0g\0h\0Oho ho!
Cook05_Vagrant005	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x01Try to consider how the ingredients will\ncomplement one another.\n\nIf you play your cards right, you may\neven end up with a dish that can help\nprotect you from extreme cold.\nIt's all about being creative and trying\ndifferent things.\x0e\x05\x01\0 \x0e\x04\x02\x18\x16\0C\0u\0s\0t\0o\0m\0L\0a\0u\0g\0h\0Oho ho!

Cook07	\x0e\x04\x01\x02\x07ÍNot bad. \x0e\x05\0\0Certainly not good...\n\x0e\x05\0\0but not bad either.
Cook08	\x0e\x04\x01\x02\nÍThey say failure is a stepping-stone to\nsuccess, right? Perhaps they were\nreferring to your culinary shortcomings...
Cook09	I encourage you to experiment with some\ndifferent ingredient combinations.\n\nThe variety of food one can make out\nhere in the wild is quite remarkable.\n\x0e\x05\x01\0\x0e\x04\x02\x18\x16\0C\0u\0s\0t\0o\0m\0L\0a\0u\0g\0h\0Oho ho!
Cook10	In case you were wondering, I know you\nwere poking around in my diary.\n\n\x0e\x04\x01\x02\x02ÍThat said, if you do end up figuring out\nhow to create that dish I wrote about,\nmy warm doublet is all yours.
Cook11	If it's \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0raw meat \x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿyou're after, try hunting\nin the \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0Forest of Spirits\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ. You'll find it in\nthe northern part of the plateau.
Cook12	If it's \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0raw meat\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ you're after, try your\nhand at hunting some game here.

Cook14	I simply cannot remember what the last\ningredient is. Though I do recall that I\nfound it near the tower...
Idou00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04I was just about to go cut down a few\ntrees over there. We'll have to talk later.
Idou01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x01I'm heading home for the day.\x0e\x05\x01\0\nHow about you? All done here?
Idou02	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x01I'm heading home.\x0e\x05\x01\0 I can't offer you\nmuch, other than a solid roof and good\ncompany, but you're free to join me.
Sleep00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x0cAfter a day like this, I'm exhausted.\x0e\x05\x01\0\n*ahem* I'm afraid I'll be needing\nmy bed.
Sleep01	You can use my bed if you ever need to\nrest for a bit. Well, assuming I'm not\nalready in it, of course!
Sleep02	There's a fire outside if you're looking to\npass the time.

KariKotsu00	It is not impossible to hunt with a sword,\nbut wild prey can be quite fast...\n\n\x0e\x04\x01\x02\x02ÍI would suggest getting your hands on a\nbow and some arrows, so you can take\nshots from afar.\nWe can discuss technique after that.

TalkHatu_06	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\n\0Well, you're looking peppy today,\nstranger!
TalkHatu_01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x07\x02Welcome to my \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0stable\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.\nWe deal in all things horse related.\nWe also double as an inn.\n\x0e\x04\x03\0Huh...\x0e\x05\0\0 I haven't seen your face before.\x0e\x05\x02\0\nDo you know about the \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0stable\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ system?\x0e\x01\x04\x062\03\0\0\x01
0050	I don't.
0051	Yes, I do.
TalkHatu_02	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x04Then allow me to explain.\n\n\nYou can board your horse companions\nwith us\x0e\x05\0\0 and then summon them as\nyou please from our network of stables.\nYou may have come across \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0wild horses\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ\nduring your travels...\n\nIf you catch one and ride it here to\nregister it,\x0e\x05\0\0 it will become your horse\ncompanion.\nOne person can board up to five horses,\nand you're able to swap horses in and\nout as you please.\n\x0e\x04\x03\0Do you...know how to catch a wild\nhorse?\x0e\x01\x04\x064\05\0\0\x01
0052	Catching horses?
0053	I know how.
TalkHatu_03	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x04OK. To catch a wild horse, all you have to\ndo is approach it from behind—\x0e\x05\0\0slowly, so\nit doesn't notice you—and then hop on.\nBut these are wild animals we're talking\nabout, so if the horse you're riding starts\nto act up, try soothing it.\nIt will eventually settle down, and when\nthat happens, bring it to me.\n\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\x04It may take a while for wild horses to get\nused to being ridden.\n\nThey may change directions or slow\ndown on their own until you earn their\ntrust and respect.\nIf your horse disobeys your direction,\nyou'll want to gently redirect it and\nthen calm it.\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x01And if you continue interacting that way,\nyour horse will naturally begin to trust\nyou and become more obedient.
TalkHatu_04	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x05\0Oh, pardon me.\nLet me start over...
TalkHatu_05	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x04That's all I can tell you about the\nsubject, stranger.

0030	Let one go.

Register02	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Which horse do you want to release?

Register13	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\0Please give this little one a fitting name.
Register18	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\0Oh, and by the way...\n\n\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\0If you get separated from your horse,\nyou can whistle and it will come running!
Register19	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0But your horse isn't magic. It can't hear\nyou if you're too far away, so do keep\nthat in mind!
Advice01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x02If you're riding on a road, your horse \nwill just naturally follow the path, as is\nits instinct.\nTravel by road if you want to leave the\nsteering up to your steed and just enjoy\nthe scenery!
Advice02	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x17If a horse gets spooked or doesn't like \nwhere it's at, it might shut down and\nrefuse to move at all.\nIf that happens, you can \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0target\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ while\nmounted and then force the horse to\n\x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0move step by step\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.\nJust be sure you don't put your horse\nin a dangerous situation.
Advice03	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x02To talk to someone while on horseback,\njust \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0target\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ them first. \n\nBut you won't be able to talk to anyone\nif you're riding too fast, so slow it down.
Advice04	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x02If you get separated from your horse,\njust whistle and it'll come running.
Advice05	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x02Horses that have lots of \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0stamina\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ can\nrun at top speed for a long time.\n\nHowever, they can't turn well when\nthey're running at top speed.\n\nIf your horse can't turn sharply, you're\nmore likely to hit obstacles, so think\nbefore you ask your horse to sprint.

talk_hintSelect00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0The best way to get into Hyrule Castle is\nto employ the styles of the people of\nHyrule, obviously.

RetMSG_Gerud_01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Kara Kara Bazaar is sounding real nice\nright about now, but...\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x01\x02\t\0I can't sand-seal surf, so I'd have\nto walk, and I'm not feeling up to that\nright now.\nWhy didn't I ever learn how to stay\nupright while one of those things pulls\nme around the desert? \x0e\x05\x01\0*sigh*

RetMSG_Gerud_04_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0In the worst of the desert heat, have\nsome hydromelon. \x0e\x05\0\0There's nothing\nbetter for cooling off.\nI would never go outside the town walls\nwithout some when I was a young vai.

MSG_Firo_04	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Starting from here at Lakeside Stable, if\nyou go further east, you'll come to a\nfishing village called Lurelin Village.\nOf course, it'd be awful if I left out the\npart about how you'll definitely be\nattacked by monsters along the way.

MSG_Futa_00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x02Have you ever been to Kakariko Village?\x0e\x05\x01\0\nThey've got great food and great clothes,\nbut it ain't cheap!
MSG_Futa_00_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Kakariko Village is a great place if you\nlike good food and fashion. There are\nsome rare finds there, if you've got cash.
MSG_Futa_01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x02I got a question for ya,\x0e\x05\0\0 kiddo.\x0e\x05\x01\0 Are\nyou much of a mountain climber?\n\nI was, back when I was your age.\nNothing gets me going like the sight of\na treacherous cliff, daring me to climb it!
MSG_Futa_01_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Take a look at these cliffs. So steep, so\ntreacherous. Back in my day, I wouldn't\nhave hesitated to climb right up 'em.
MSG_Futa_02	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04\x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0Kakariko Village\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ is just a short jump to\nthe north of the bridge,\x0e\x05\0\0 but the road to\n\x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0Hateno Village\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ, to the east, is very long.\nYou want my advice,\x0e\x05\0\0 you'd buy stuff that\nfills you with vigor, you know? Gives you\nthe stamina you need.\x0e\x05\x01\0\nThat's just if you want my advice.
MSG_Futa_02_1	\x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Kakariko Village\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ is just a short jump to\nthe north of the bridge,\x0e\x05\0\0 but the road to\n\x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0Hateno Village\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ, to the east, is very long.\nYou want my advice,\x0e\x05\0\0 you'd buy stuff that\nfills you with vigor, you know? Gives you\nthe stamina you need.\x0e\x05\x01\0
MSG_Futa_03	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04Whenever you feel your stamina starting\nto dip down low, you should chow down\non stamina-boosting foods to fix you up.\nIf you're intent on running around all\nover the place,\x0e\x05\0\0 you'll want to keep some\nstamina-boosting ingredients on hand.
MSG_Futa_03_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Climbing and running are hard work, and\nyou'll want foods that boost your stamina\non-hand to keep you from tuckering out.
MSG_Futa_04	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x04That girl at the Kakariko Village clothes\nshop is a real cutie-pie,\x0e\x05\0\0 but she's out of\nmy reach—like a flower on a high peak.\x0e\x05\0\0\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x01She has a nice \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0stealth chest guard\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ,\x0e\x05\0\0 but\nit costs a pretty penny. Makes it harder\nfor monsters to find you, she says.\x0e\x05\0\0\nAlas, I'm too old for her, and too poor\nfor that outfit...
MSG_Futa_04_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0The stealth chest guard masks your\nmovements and makes it hard for\nmonsters to spot you.\nIt'd come in real handy when I'm on the\nroad,\x0e\x05\x01\0 but at that price, it's out of my\nreach...just like the cutie who sells it.
RetMSG_Futa_00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x02When I was a young lad, I used to use\nDueling Peaks Stable as a base for when\nI'd go mountain climbing.\nIt's the busiest place around these parts.
RetMSG_Futa_00_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0When I was a young lad, I used to use\nDueling Peaks Stable as a base for when\nI'd go mountain climbing.
RetMSG_Futa_01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x02We're right near the stable.\x0e\x05\0\0 I can see by\nthat look in your eyes that even if you\nrest the night, you won't stay for long.\nI know what it's like to hear the sound\nof adventure calling your name.
RetMSG_Futa_01_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0We're right near the stable. I can't wait\nto rest these old bones.
RetMSG_Futa_02	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04If you're looking to head toward\nHateno Village, just cross the bridge\nand head to the east.
RetMSG_Futa_02_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0If you're headed for Hateno Village, it's\nover the bridge then to the east. But if\nyou're going by foot, it's quite a trek.
RetMSG_Futa_03	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04Climbing cliffs is a challenge on a rainy\nday, even for an old hand like me.\x0e\x05\x01\0 Best\nto just wait out the rain on those days.
RetMSG_Futa_03_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Climbing cliffs is a challenge on a rainy\nday. Just find yourself a place to hole\nup 'til it passes.
RetMSG_Futa_04	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\x10I hear tell of a strange fountain about\nhalfway up the side of the mountain by\nthis village.\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x01If you're looking for adventure, go seek\nit out. And why not bring some food for\nthe trip, just to cover your bases?
RetMSG_Futa_04_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0I'm real curious about that strange\nfountain. If you decide to check it out,\nmake sure you're prepared for the trip.
Rest_00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Taking a break, kiddo?\x0e\x05\0\0 Not a bad idea,\nthat. As a climber myself, I understand\nwhere you're coming from.\x0e\x05\0\0\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\x10It's not always about pushing your\nstamina to the limit.\x0e\x05\0\0 But if you DO, I'd\nrecommend a nice stamella shroom. \n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x01Any food you cook with one of those\nbaked in will give you a surge of vigor.\x0e\x05\x01\0\nShould be just the boost you need!
Rest_01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x10There's some folks who've got what you\nmight call a connection with the rain.\nFollows 'em wherever they go.\x0e\x05\x01\0\nMe, I've got a connection to the\nmountains. I'd be climbing right now if\nthe weather didn't make it so dangerous.
Rest_02	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x10I guess I'm stuck until this rain passes...\x0e\x05\x02\0\n\n\nHey, kiddo, you want to buy some\ningredients that'll give your stamina\na kick?

MSG_Futa_03	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Here's the truth, straight from the\nhorse's mouth:\x0e\x05\x01\0 the only thing I'm good\nfor is horses and horse facts.\nTake this, for instance: did you know that\nyou can shoot arrows from horseback?\n\nIt's a good option if you want to pop a\nfew shots off without any monsters\ngetting any swings in at you.

Rest_00	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0I am in the midst of a journey, not unlike\nyou are.\x0e\x05\x01\0 Though, to be frank, mine is\nmore of a pilgrimage.\nI do hope that Princess Zelda's devout\nprayers for peace will touch the lives\nof others \x0e\x05\0\0as they have touched mine.
Rest_01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x05\x10I take a break from my pilgrimage\nwhenever it rains.\x0e\x05\0\0 It gives me time\nfor introspection.\nIs my heart truly devoted to prayer?\x0e\x05\0\0\nAm I deceiving myself in any way?\x0e\x05\0\0\nYou know, things like that.
Rest_02	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x05\x10I wonder if this same rain is falling on\nHyrule Castle...\n\nMay the spirit of King Rhoam,\nPrincess Zelda's noble father,\x0e\x05\0\0\nbe at peace...

MSG_Rane_03	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04You must understand, \x0e\x05\0\0there are two key\ncomponents to cooking:\x0e\x05\x01\0 heating the food\nevenly and...not putting any bugs in it.
MSG_Rane_03_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x06The trick to proper cooking is even heat\x0e\x05\0\0\nand no bugs. Isn't that right, my finicky\nfriend?
MSG_Rane_03_2	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\tYou understand, don't you, donkey?\x0e\x05\0\0\nOf course you do. You understand me.

RetMSG_Rane_00_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x10Oh, look at the time. Perhaps I'd better\nstop at the Wetland Stables\x0e\x05\0\0 and prepare\ndinner—and an elixir or two.
RetMSG_Rane_01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04Oh, dear.\x0e\x05\0\0 You're asking why you should\ncook food?\x0e\x05\x01\0 Don't you realize that eating\nraw foods can lead to food poisoning?

RetMSG_Rane_02	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04I don't pay any mind to the horses that\npass me by.\x0e\x05\0\0 Horses think they're so\nelegant, but give me a donkey any day.\nSlow of foot, to be sure, but strong of\nback and stubborn as a...well, you know.\x0e\x05\0\0\nThat's what's great about donkeys!\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x04\x13Oh, dear.\x0e\x05\0\0 You mean you weren't asking\nme to pontificate upon the charms of\nthe equus donkus, as they are known?

RetMSG_Rane_03_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x06If you are making elixirs, you need bugs\nand monster parts as ingredients.
RetMSG_Rane_03_2	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\tWho is just the cleverest donkey in all\nof donkeydom?\x0e\x05\0\0 That's right! You!

MSG_Kyu_01_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x01\x04I have a feeling that I will soon find this\ndragon I am searching for...\n\nThe legend says that one remains near a\nsacred spring!
MSG_Kyu_02	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x06I'm looking for a legendary dragon... One\nsaid to be so large that its body blocks\nout the sun when it rises into the sky.
MSG_Kyu_02_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04I'm looking for a legendary dragon...one\nthought to be of immense size.

MSG_Kyu_03_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x05\x10I wonder if anyone in Hyrule has actually\never seen a dragon...

RetMSG_Kyu_01_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04These dragons of legend that I keep\nhearing about... Do they live in the sky\nor down here with us?
RetMSG_Kyu_02	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x05\x10According to legend, I need the blessing\nof the Goddess Hylia before I can see\nthis legendary dragon.\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x01It all sounds like a fairy tale...
RetMSG_Kyu_02_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04It's said that in order for me to come\nface to face with a real, live dragon, I\nneed the blessing of the Goddess Hylia.
RetMSG_Kyu_03	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x02You might think I'm a real weirdo\x0e\x05\0\0\nif I tell you about this, but I say a little\nprayer I made up every morning.\nIt's an incantation to pray that I'll\x0e\x05\0\0\nbe able to meet the legendary creature.
RetMSG_Kyu_03_1	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04I recite a prayer every morning in the\nhope that I might be able to actually see\nthis legendary dragon!

MSG_Kyu_04	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x02I love every little thing about horses.\nI love their fur, the way they smell,\ntheir bones even.\nSpeaking of bones, I once rode a horse\nmade of nothing but bones!

talk21	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\0But a \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0one-color\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ horse has more\nstamina and runs faster, right?
talk22	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x06\x01Dad said they're hard to handle at first,\nbut if you spend a lot of time with a\n\x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0one-color \x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿhorse, you'll be best buds!

talk08	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04They're really wild, so they'll run in\ndifferent directions and buck here and\nthere because they aren't trained yet.\nWhen that happens, you've gotta soothe\nthem!

talk25	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x06\x01The trick is to soothe them when they do\nwhat you want them to do.\n\nIt's like saying "thanks" to them for a job\nwell done!

talk21	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0You sent some Gorons back here.\x0e\x05\0\0\nThat's perfect. The brute strength of a\nGoron is undeniable.\nThose boulders don't stand a chance\nagainst them... And with names like\nGreyson and Pelison, they'll fit right in.\nAlso, Pelison started selling the \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0ore\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ\nfound within the boulders.\x0e\x05\x02\0\nYou should go say hello again.
talk22	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0So before more people can move here,\nwe need homes for them to live in.\x0e\x05\x02\0\nCan you bring me \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\020 bundles of wood\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ?
talk23	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Did you bring the \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\020 bundles of wood\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ?\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x0c\0\x0d\0\0\x01

talk25	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\0If we're talking about \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0tailoring\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ...\x0e\x05\x02\0\nthere could be someone among the\n\x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0Gerudo\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ who's good at that.
talk26	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Working such long hours every day really\nwears on my clothes.\n\nCould you look for \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0someone who's got a\ngift for tailoring\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ for me?\x0e\x01\n\x04_\0\x01Í
talk27	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Karson and President Bolson \njust arrived. I can only imagine how tired\nthey are from their long journey.\nWe should hold the ceremony on\nanother day.
talk28	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0You should take today to rest, too.\n\n\nIf you need a place to stay, talk to\nKapson.\x0e\x05\0\0 He'll probably let you stay for\nfree.
talk29	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Think of how tired the \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0big boss \x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿand\nKarson must be.\x0e\x05\0\0 Let's have the\nceremony on another day.
talk30	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\0If we're looking for a people\ndevout enough to have a \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0priest-like\nperson\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ...\x0e\x05\0\0I'd suggest the \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0Zora\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.
talk31	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0You found someone from the Gerudo.\n\x0e\x05\0\0Thank you.\n\nShe was able to patch every last hole in\nmy work clothes before I could blink.\nShe's pretty...er, amazing!\nAnd since her name is Rhondson, I have\nno objections.\n\nI hear she's decided to continue putting\nher skills to use by opening a \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0clothing\nshop\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.\x0e\x05\0\0 You should stop by and say hello.
talk32	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0So before more people can move here,\nwe need more homes for them to live in.\x0e\x05\x02\0\nCan you bring me \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\030 bundles of wood\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ?

talk35	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\0Oh, that's a good thought...\x0e\x05\0\0\n\x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0Rito\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ can fly around\x0e\x05\0\0, so they should be\nable to retrieve and deliver supplies.
talk36	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0It's finally starting to look like a town\naround here.\x0e\x05\0\0 Which is exactly why we\nneed to set up some distribution.\nI'd like to get a general store up and\nrunning, but there's no one with the\nconnections and qualifications to run it.\nDo you think you could keep an eye out\nfor someone who knows about\n\x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0distribution\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ and \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0can run a general store\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ?\x0e\x01\n\x04`\0\x01Í
talk37	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Good luck! You'll need it... This seems\nlike a real long shot.
talk38	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Thank you.
talk39	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0You managed to find a Rito and bring him\nback here. Thank you.\n\nHe wasted no time getting a general\nstore up and running—apparently his\nfamily runs one too.\nAnd with a name like Fyson,\nhe'll fit right in!\n\nHe's selling things that he's picked up\nwhile flying around. \x0e\x05\x02\0You should really go\ncheck out the store.
talk40	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0So before we can call more people here,\nwe need even more homes for them.\x0e\x05\x02\0\nCan you bring me \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\050 bundles of wood\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ?
talk41	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Did you bring the \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\050 bundles of wood\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ?\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x0c\0\x0d\0\0\x01

talk44	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Oh, not that kind of personal.\nActually, I got engaged.\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x10\0\x12\0\0\x02

talk47	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Thank you.\x0e\x01\n\x04\x11\0\x01Í
talk48	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0You say that, but for some reason, I\nthink you mean the opposite...
talk49	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Anyway, we want to have a little\nceremony to celebrate, but we need\nsomeone priest-like to officiate.\nCould you look for someone \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0priest-like\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ\nfor us?\x0e\x01\n\x04a\0\x01Í
talk50	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Now Rhondson and I can be married!
talk51	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0You found a Zora?\x0e\x05\0\0 Thank you...really.\n\n\nHe and I talked earlier, \x0e\x05\0\0and he said that\nhe literally was a priest before he retired.\nYou can't get more priest-like than that.\nAnd his name is Kapson, so I have no\nobjections there.\n\nIt really is amazing that you were able to\nfind someone priest-like who also had\nan acceptable name...
talk52	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Of course, we'll have to invite guests in\norder to hold a ceremony...\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x14\0\x01\0\0\x01
talk53	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Well, I'm talking about my boss, Bolson,\nand my subordinate, Karson.\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x15\0\x01\0\0\x01
talk54	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0However, I've got to prepare for the\nceremony, so my hands are full...\x0e\x05\0\0\nCould you invite them for me?\x0e\x01\x04\x06[\0\x16\0\0\x01

talk56	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Once Karson and the boss Bolson get\nhere,\x0e\x05\0\0 we can start the ceremony.\n\nThey're probably still in Hateno Village.\x0e\x05\x02\0\nCan you invite them for me?
talk57	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0You extended my invitation for me.\x0e\x05\0\0\nThank you.
talk58	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Now then, Karson and the boss Bolson\nare waiting for things to begin...\n\nShall we start the ceremony?\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x16\0\x18\0\0\x01
talk59	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0I understand...\x0e\x05\0\0 This is an exciting event\nfor me too. When you've collected\nyourself, come talk to me.

talk83	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0These were found inside the boulders we\nsmashed when we were clearing land.\n\nRhondson and I have no use for them.\x0e\x05\x02\0\nYou can take them.
talk84	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Well, I want to give them to you,\x0e\x05\0\0 but it\nlooks like you haven't got room\nfor \x0e\0\x03\x02\0\0three\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0diamonds\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.

talk88	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0Then get to it.\n\n\nYou've traveled the world helping folks,\nbut there's more that need helping.\x0e\x05\x02\0 You\ndon't have the luxury of tarrying here.
talk89	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0I see...\x0e\x05\x02\0 In that case, stay as long as you\nlike, OK?
talk90	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x13Oh.
talk91	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04Hello.
talk95	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x13You know where they are. The \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0boss\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ and\nKarson\x0e\x05\0\0 are in Hateno Village, right?\x0e\x01\n\x04\x15\0\x01Í

talk01	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04Bringing down \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0Divine Beast Vah Medoh\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ\nlike that...\x0e\x05\x02\0\n\nTo tell you the truth, I might not have\nbeen able to do it alone.\x0e\x05\0\0 Thanks again.

talk03	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\x06What's next for you?\nCharging headlong into danger?\n\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0As for me...\x0e\x05\0\0 Heh,\x0e\x05\x02\0 I guess I'll be\nbabysitting Tulin at the \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0Flight Range\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.
talk07	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x12Well then...\x0e\x05\x02\0 I should probably get Tulin\nover to the \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0Flight Range\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ. \x0e\x01\x04\x06\x04\0\x05\0\0\x01

talk31	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04When this rain lets up, I think I'll take\nTulin to the \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0Flight Range\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.
talk08	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x04Hmm...\x0e\x05\x02\0\nI see you've got the \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0Great Eagle Bow\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ\nfrom the \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0elder\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ. \nThat thing is way too heavy to use in\naerial fighting—I'd end up sacrificing\nall of my speed just to take a shot.\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x0b\0Now, if I had both the strength and\nspeed of Master Revali, that would be a\ndifferent story...\n\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\0But seeing the way you handled your\nbow against \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0Medoh\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ, I suggested we\nlet you borrow the \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0Great Eagle Bow\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.\nTake it with you on your adventure,\nalong with the respect of the Rito...
talk09	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x12Well then...\n\n\nMy wounds are just about healed,\x0e\x05\0\0 so I \nguess it's time for me to take Tulin\nto the \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0Flight Range\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.\nI'm hoping Tulin grows up to be a\ndistinguished warrior like Master Revali.\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x04\0\x05\0\0\x01
talk28	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\0\x12Well then...\n\n\nMy wounds are just about healed,\x0e\x05\0\0 so\nwhen Tulin wakes up, I think I'll take him\nto the \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0Flight Range\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.\nI'm hoping Tulin grows up to be a\ndistinguished warrior like Master Revali.

talk24	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x03\x0cIt really was unfortunate about Mipha...\x0e\x05\0\0\nBut I was saddest about you, Linny.
talk25	\x0e\x03\x01\x02\x06\x01Wait...what was I going to say?

Diary00	\x0e\x01\x02\0On this desolate plateau, the only\npleasure that brings me comfort\nis cooking.\n\x0e\x01\x02\0And today, I outdid myself! Truly,\nI created the perfect dish. I call it...\nspicy meat and seafood fry.
Diary01	\x0e\x01\x02\0This recipe not only restores health,\nbut it also keeps me warm, even when\ntraveling in the snowy mountains.\n\x0e\x01\x02\0With this dish on my side, I no longer\nhave need of that itchy \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0warm doublet\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x07\0\x05\0\0\x01
Diary02	\x0e\x01\x02\0I do not know how I allowed this to\nhappen, but it seems I forgot to\nwrite down a very important recipe.\n\x0e\x01\x02\0I know it contained raw meat and\nspicy pepper. However...\n\n\x0e\x01\x02\0I simply cannot remember what else\nI used! My age is catching up to me.\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x07\0\x05\0\0\x01
Diary03	\x0e\x01\x02\0Sadly, on this lonely plateau, I have only\nmy own knowledge and memory to\nrely on. Still...\n\x0e\x01\x02\0If I did find someone who knew the\nmissing ingredient, I would happily\nreward them with my \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0warm doublet\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ.\n\x0e\x01\x02\0However, it seems unlikely that such a\nmiraculous wish will ever be fulfilled.\x0e\x01\x08\x86\x08\0\0\0\x03\0:\0N\0p\0c\0_\0K\0i\0n\0g\0_\0C\0h\0o\0i\0c\0e\0E\0x\0c\0l\0u\0d\0e\0_\0R\0e\0c\0i\0p\0e\0\x01\0:\0N\0p\0c\0_\0K\0i\0n\0g\0_\0C\0h\0o\0i\0c\0e\0E\0x\0c\0l\0u\0d\0e\0_\0F\0i\0n\0i\0s\0h\0\x05\0\0\0\x03\x03
Diary04	\x0e\x01\x02\0To my surprise and delight, I did happen\nupon someone who was able to re-create\nmy spicy meat and seafood fry.\n\x0e\x01\x02\0I gave him my \x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0warm doublet\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ, and I was\nhappy to do so. He is a fine young man\nwith great potential, that one.\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x07\0\x05\0\0\x01
Diary05	\x0e\x01\x02\0Ah, and I will now write down this\nperfect recipe so that I will never\nforget it.\n\x0e\x01\x02\0Place some raw meat, spicy pepper,\nand hyrule bass in a pot, and then\nturn up the heat. Voilà!\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x07\0\x05\0\0\x01
Diary06	\x0e\x01\x02\0Eating this dish allows you to walk the\nsnowy mountains with ease, though I did\nforget there's a time limit on the effect.\n\x0e\x01\x02\0It is too bad I already gave away that\n\x0e\0\x03\x02\x02\0warm doublet\x0e\0\x03\x02ÿÿ, which keeps you warm\nno matter how long you wear it.\x0e\x01\x08L\x08\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\x01\0:\0N\0p\0c\0_\0K\0i\0n\0g\0_\0C\0h\0o\0i\0c\0e\0E\0x\0c\0l\0u\0d\0e\0_\0F\0i\0n\0i\0s\0h\0\x05\0\0\0\x03\x03

talk01	Date: ???\n\n\nWork has finally begun on my anti-aging\nrune. If all goes to plan, I believe it will\neffectively reverse the aging process.\nThis technology will enable us to make\nretired warriors young again, thereby\nstrengthening the Hyrulean army.\nWhen Calamity Ganon inevitably returns,\nwe'll be ready. Our offense will be solid,\nand our defense impenetrable.\nThe need for this tech pains me, but I\ntruly hope to use it to attain everlasting\npeace for all.\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0ÿÿ\0\0\x03\0\0\0\x05\0\0\0\0\x03
talk02	Date: ???\n\n\nThe beta version of my anti-aging rune\nis complete. I have already added it to\nthe Sheikah Slate I made for myself.\nSince I am to be the test subject of this\nexperiment, Symin booted up the rune\nand directed its rays at my body.\nAfter 20 seconds of exposure, I felt\nextreme fatigue and broke into a fever,\nforcing us to cease the experiment.\nUnable to stay awake, I went to bed\nimmediately. Tomorrow I will try to\nfigure out what went awry.\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0\x03\0\0\0\x04\0\0\0\x05\0\0\0\0\x03
talk03	Anti-Aging Experimental Trial\nDay 2\n\nMy extreme full-body fatigue has slightly\nimproved, for which I am grateful. Still,\nI do not recognize the face in my mirror.\nMy hair is thick again and floor-length.\nMy wrinkles, once deep as trenches,\nhave vanished without a trace.\nIt seems the anti-aging effect works.\nHowever, I did not expect the reversal\nto happen so frighteningly fast.\nThis morning I kicked Symin awake and\nhad him run a full physical exam on me.\n\nMy height, weight, vision, bone density,\nheart, blood... We tested everything we\ncould, pushing our facility to its limit.\nOur discoveries were startling. My results\nwere typical of a Sheikah woman in her\nearly 50s.\nIn other words, I reversed my age by\nmore than 70 years in a single night.\n\nI can only hope I do not awaken to find\nI have the body of a newborn baby...\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0\x03\0\0\0\x04\0\0\0\x05\0\0\0\0\x03
talk04	Anti-Aging Experimental Trial\nDay 3\n\nI awoke with an abundance of energy.\nIt has been decades since I slept so well.\n\nUpon waking, I immediately checked the\nmirror, only to be greeted by a youthful\nversion of myself.\nAccording to Symin's examination,\nI have the body of a Sheikah woman\nin her 30s.\nThirty years old... I was around that age\nwhen I was first able to continue my\nresearch following the Great Calamity.\nThe first thing I did was try to figure out\nhow to expand the functionality of the\nSheikah Sensor.\nI was around 80 years old when that\nexpansion was completed. I intend to\nbequeath this tech to our sleeping hero.\nI hope to the gods that he will be able to\nassist in the destruction of the Calamity\nthat swallowed our Princess Zelda whole.\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0\x03\0\0\0\x04\0\0\0\x05\0\0\0\0\x03
talk05	Anti-Aging Experimental Trial\nDay 4\n\nAfter today's routine physical, the results\nshow that I have the body of a Sheikah\nwoman in her 20s.\nI haven't felt this good in a century!\nThis is all taking me back to when the\nGreat Calamity happened...\nGanon had been dormant for 10,000\nyears. Perhaps his power had been\nbuilding all that time.\nThe slaughter that followed was arbitrary\nand merciless. The destruction complete.\n\nWe lost everything... Hyrule Castle,\nPrincess Zelda... Well, perhaps not \neverything was lost.\nA youth named Link was brought to me a\nhundred years ago, covered in wounds\nand on death's doorstep.\nLink... So young, yet so courageous.\n\n\nHe was the youngest knight to have ever\nbeen appointed to the Imperial Guard at\nHyrule Castle.\nHe was also a gifted swordsman who was\nselected as captain of Princess Zelda's\npersonal guard.\nI thought his skills would be enough to\ndefeat Ganon in glorious fashion...\n\nSince ancient times, the royal family of\nHyrule and us Sheikah researchers have\nhad a strong bond. Their pain is our own.\nWe took the swordsman and the\nSheikah Slate Princess Zelda left\nbehind to the Shrine of Resurrection.\nAlthough the Slumber of Restoration had\nnot been fully tested, we decided to put\nthe swordsman under to save his life.\nIt was the best we could do...\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0\x03\0\0\0\x04\0\0\0\x05\0\0\0\0\x03
talk06	Anti-Aging Experimental Trial\nDay 5\n\nI awoke to something horrifying...\na scarlet lump scarring my\notherwise youthful face.\nAfter analyzing this monstrosity,\nI have come to the conclusion that\nit is just a pimple. A big one.\nThe results of today's physical exam\nindicate that my body and mind have\nreverted to those of a teenager.\nI feel like Symin looks at me differently.\nWhich irritates me. I got angry when he\ninsisted on running my blood test for me.\nI mean, really! What even!

It's super annoying.\nWhere is that genius swordsman we\nplaced in the Slumber of Restoration,\nanyway? Wake up, already!\nIf he doesn't awaken soon, my feature\nexpansions for the Sheikah Sensor will\ngo to waste.\nBut even if he does manage to wake up,\nhow can I be sure he'll find me here?\n\nI want to go and just kick Linky awake,\nbut I doubt Symin would help me. It'd be\nhard with my 6-year-old body anyway.\nInstead, I think I'll begin working on a\nrune to un-reverse my aging process.\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0\x03\0\0\0\x04\0\0\0\x05\0\0\0\0\x03

I hope it will, anyway.\nAll I need to do is increase the output\nand expose myself to its rays...\n\nHowever, when I tried to add this feature\nto the Sheikah Slate I made, I found that\nthe Guidance Stone had stopped!\nWhat's more, the blue flame in the\nfurnace outside has gone out!\n\nI sent Symin to the ancient furnace,\nbut he was too clumsy and it was\nraining and nothing went to plan.\nSo I had to go down there to help,\nbut a girl in the village saw me.\nWhat a mess I've made...

talk03	The Sheikah Sensor is one of the basic\nrunes found on the Sheikah Slate.\n\nIf it senses an ancient shrine containing\na hero trial nearby, it will lead you there\nby emitting a series of sounds.\nThe interval between sounds shortens\nthe closer you get to a shrine.
talk04	The Sheikah Sensor + is a rune that\nexpands the features of the normal\nSheikah Sensor.\nIt is able to detect any object that\nis listed in the Hyrule Compendium.\nHere's how it works...\n1. Open the Hyrule Compendium by\nselecting Map→Sheikah Sensor→\nHyrule Compendium.\n2. Select a picture from the\nHyrule Compendium.\n\n3. Select "Target with sensor."\n\n\n4. Select "Target This."\n\n\nDo this and the Sheikah Sensor + will\nuse a series of sounds to lead you to\nthe object you want to detect.\nTo detect shrines again, select Map→\nSheikah Sensor→Shrine.\n\nTo stop detecting altogether, just select\nMap→Sheikah Sensor→OFF.\x0e\x01\n\x04\x02\0\x01Í

talk01	Let me start from the beginning. It was\n100 years ago... Calamity Ganon had\nalready swallowed Princess Zelda.\nDr. Purah and I had already taken Link\nto the Shrine of Resurrection and left\nhim to recover.\nDr. Purah and I departed for\nKakariko Village, where we left\nLady Impa...\nAll three of us couldn't stay together, of\ncourse. We couldn't risk Calamity Ganon\ngetting all of us in one strike.\nIf that happened, there'd be no one left\nto deliver Princess Zelda's message to\nLink when he recovered and woke up...\nWe had to ensure at least one of us\nwould be able to talk to him.\n\nSo Dr. Purah and I set out to survive as\nlong as we could. We were lucky...\n\nWe found large amounts of ancient\nenergy in the Necluda and Akkala\nregions. We could continue our research.\nJust as we had in Hyrule Castle, we could\nagain set ourselves to finding some way\nto seal Calamity Ganon away.\nWe decided who would go where in the\nonly fair way: rock, paper, scissors.\nI set out for Akkala soon after.\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0ÿÿ\0\0\0\0\0\0\x03\0\0\0\0\x03
talk02	I was all set to go to Akkala, but first I\ndecided to go with Dr. Purah to the\nancient energy source in Necluda.\n...Actually, that implies I had any choice.\nDr. Purah laid on a pretty heavy guilt trip\nwhen I suggested her going alone.\n"In a world as dangerous as ours, are\nyou seriously asking me to travel alone?"\nShe's so darned pushy...\nAnyway, Dr. Purah promised Lady Impa\nthat they'd meet again someday, then\nshe and I set out from Kakariko Village...\nBut not before loading a cart with the\nGuidance Stone Dr. Purah had been\nusing at Hyrule Castle.\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0\0\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\x03\0\0\0\0\x03
talk03	We traveled for some time. South of the\nPillars of Levia, across Lake Siela, and\nthrough Blatchery Plain... \nThen we came upon Fort Hateno. Link\nhad battled an army of Guardians there,\nand it was where he'd been defeated.\nA master swordsman such as Link, who'd\nimpressed King Rhoam enough to be\nmade Princess Zelda's personal knight...\nWell, even someone like that has their\nlimits.\n\nI'm sorry, Link...\nI spent so much of my life researching\nthe Guardians...\nEven with all my knowledge, I wasn't\nable to give you the weapons or power\nyou needed to succeed.\nThose were my thoughts as I looked\nupon the broken husks of the Guardians\nstrewn around Fort Hateno.\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0\0\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\x03\0\0\0\0\x03
talk04	Lost in my thoughts, I didn't notice that\nDr. Purah had slipped away.\n\nI knew Hateno Village wasn't much\nfarther along the road, and that the\nCalamity had barely touched that area...\nSo I felt safe letting her continue on her\nown. We parted ways without even\nsaying good-bye, I suppose.\nStirring myself back to action, I set\nout on my own journey back toward\nKakariko Village.\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0\0\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\x03\0\0\0\0\x03
talk05	With Dr. Purah "escorted" safely to\nHateno Village, it was time for me to\nhead to my new home in Akkala.\nI returned to Kakariko Village to collect\nthe remaining Guidance Stone, then I\nimmediately set out for Akkala.\nI made my way through the\nLanayru Wetlands and headed\ntoward Ternio Trail.\nI knew that once I crossed the\nAkkala Span, I would officially be in\nAkkala.\nThe autumn leaves brought some joy to\nmy spirit as I crossed Shadow Pass\nthen headed north from Ordorac Quarry.\nAkkala is known for its long stretches of\nnothing. I'd set out hoping that would\nstill be the case...\nI was attacked by a Guardian here and\nthere as I went, but remember, I'd spent\nmy life studying them.\nDispatching them individually was no\nchallenge at all.\n\nIn time, I reached the lighthouse in\nAkkala. What a perfect place to keep an\neye on the monsters out there.\nI unloaded my Guidance Stone and\nsettled into my new home.\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0\0\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\x03\0\0\0\0\x03
talk06	And so began my life of solitary\nresearch...\n\nI knew I had to continue to research the\nancient soldier gear for Link... He could\nwake at any time.\nI quickly settled on a routine. First,\nI would carry the blue flame from\nTumlea Heights.\nNext, I would melt the ancient materials,\nrefine the result, and then shape it into\nancient soldier gear.\nIt's difficult to say how much progress\nI made on my research. The routine\ndemanded so much focus, day after day.\nBut then I had a clever thought!\nI realized I could automate the entire\nrefinement process!\nIt took some significant work, but I was\nable to successfully remodel the\nGuidance Stone.\nThanks to my effort, it can refine any\nancient material inserted into it and offer\nsomething in return.\nI named this machine Cherry, after the\nfirst girl I ever loved...\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0\0\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\x03\0\0\0\0\x03
talk07	My research didn't end with the creation\nof Cherry, not at all! I realized that if she\nwas able to refine the ancient materials...\nThere was no reason she couldn't also\nmanufacture ancient soldier gear, too!\nAnyone could make ancient equipment!\nI also decided then that I wanted to be\nable to give her a voice so she could\nspeak.\nI was filled with ambition then, but it was\nno easy task to make my dreams a\nreality.\nAutomating the manufacturing process\nwas extremely difficult. It took me\ndecades to figure it out.\nI'll spare you the details of all the things\nthat went wrong...\n\nBut I will say it was complex enough that\nI had to put my desires to remodel\nCherry on the back burner for a while.\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0\0\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\x03\0\0\0\0\x03
talk08	Days and months came and went. Before\nI even realized it, I'd reached the ripe\nage of 90.\nI would have been lost in my work even\nthen... But around that time, a young\nwoman named Jerrin arrived.\nShe'd first trained with Dr. Purah, then\nLady Impa had sent her to aid me. She\nquickly proved herself quite capable.\nShe carried the blue flame from\nTumlea Heights and even reworked and\nimproved my designs for Cherry.\nThe very fact that she had trekked all the\nway from Kakariko Village alone proved\nshe was no ordinary girl.\nHer intellect, her spirit... In hindsight, is\nit any surprise that we eventually ended\nup married?\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0\0\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\x03\0\0\0\0\x03
talk09	Thanks to Jerrin's redesign, Cherry was\nsoon crafting ancient soldier gear\nperfectly and speaking beautifully.\nShe spoke better than any machine I'd\never heard. It would have been hard to\ntell she wasn't a native Hylian.\nIf I said, "Good morning," she'd respond\nwith a sweet, "Good morning, Robbie."\n\nAnd she was helpful! "Cherry, where'd I\nleave my book?" "It's the third book from\nthe right on the second shelf, Robbie."\nShe also knew to ask if she needed\nsomething. "Robbie, could you increase\nthe furnace heat a little?"\nI'd always go personally to fetch more\nblue flame from Tumlea Heights. I didn't\nrealize our interactions hurt someone...\nThat someone...was Jerrin. Perhaps it\nwas due to her namesake, but my\nexchanges with Cherry hurt Jerrin.\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0\0\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\x03\0\0\0\0\x03
talk10	Despite the fact that she knew Cherry\nwas only a machine, she still felt uneasy\nwith my interactions with her.\nShe was in tears when she told me. She\nknew it made little sense, and yet she\ncouldn't help how she felt.\nI was devastated. I hadn't even realized\nthe pain I was causing.\n\nAlthough Jerrin had designed Cherry, she\nwas now being hurt by her own creation.\n\nWe agreed to restore Cherry to her\noriginal, mechanical way of speaking. I\ntook it upon myself to make the changes.\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0\0\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\x03\0\0\0\0\x03
talk11	From then on, I was careful to not refer\nto her as Cherry. Doing so would anger\nmy wife. Instead, I called her...\nancient oven.\n\n\nSome time later, Jerrin gave birth to a\nbaby boy, a beautiful young one who\nbore all the features of his mother.\nWe decided to name him Granté, and\ntogether we passed the time as a happy\nfamily at Akkala Ancient Tech Lab.\nIt was, unfortunately, only a temporary\npeace. Princess Zelda did her best to\ncontain Calamity Ganon...\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0\0\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\x03\0\0\0\0\x03
talk12	Around the time Granté turned three, a\nletter from Dr. Purah arrived. It was a\nshock to receive it.\nThe last time she'd written, it was to talk\nabout an assistant from Kakariko Village,\nwhom she felt was useless.\nShe was writing now to let me know\nshe'd completed research on powering\nup the runes, like Stasis.\nHearing this reinvigorated my interest\nin researching ancient soldier gear.\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0\0\0\0\0\x02\0\0\0\x03\0\0\0\0\x03
talk13	Granté grew fast, and it wasn't long\nbefore he towered over me!\n\nHe loved to carry blue flame from\nTumlea Heights, calling it a chance to\ntrain his body.\nI could see the curiosity in his eyes, and\nso I encouraged him to travel the world\nand see as much as he could.\nHe'd always been independent. But I was\nstill surprised when, the very day I told\nhim to travel, he left!\nWriting about Granté's training\nreminds me...\n\nA few days before he left, I thought it\nmight be a good idea to have Granté\nstudy with Dr. Purah.\nI wrote to her to ask what she thought of\nsuch an idea, and she sent a letter that\nsimply said...\n"Don't send anyone here!"\n\n\nI wonder what happened to her to make\nher say such a thing...\x0e\x01\x08\x12ÿÿ\0\0ÿÿ\0\0\x02\0\0\0\x03\0\0\0\0\x03

Talk01	\x0e\x01\x02\0Buliara told me today that Mother has\npassed on and gone to a better place...\n\nShe said that my mother's death means\nI am now the chief of the Gerudo people.\n\nI wish she'd stayed here, though.

Nothing can change her mind\nabout being responsible.\nMeanwhile, I can't help but feel that the\ntheft happened because I am not yet\nready to be chief...\nThe soldiers search tirelessly, trying to\nrecover the heirloom.

Diary_03	My queen has left this world.\x0e\x05\0\0 Her death\nwas so sudden and unexpected, I awaken\nmost nights unsure if she is really gone.\nZelda never cried, never faltered. Not\neven during the royal funeral or later\nwhen she and I were alone with our grief.\nI must assume her strength is a result of\nus repeatedly informing her of her duty\nto be a valiant and steady princess.\nFor a child of merely six years of age,\nher conduct was truly that of a born\nleader. Her strength gives me hope.\nFrom now on, I must raise her all alone...\nNow, only I remain to prepare her for her\ndifficult future as princess of Hyrule.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_04	Zelda finally reported back after her visit\nto the fountain.\x0e\x05\0\0 It seems her sacred\nsealing power has still yet to awaken.\nIt has been a year and three months\nsince her mother passed.\x0e\x05\0\0 Perhaps she is\nheld back by heartache too deep to heal.\nIf the Ganon prophecy wasn't looming\nover our heads, I would tell her to take\nher time... To wait until she is ready.\nBut our situation is dire and leaves no\nroom for weakness—even on behalf of\nmy beloved daughter.\nMy heart breaks for Zelda, but I must act\nas a king, not a father. I must order her\nto train relentlessly at the fountain.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_05	I was told Zelda went off to research\nancient technology, so I had no\nchoice but to confront her about it.\nShe claims she was simply using her day\noff from training to indulge in a bit of\nresearch, but still I scolded her.\nShe won't get it through her head...\nForcing me to tell her the same thing\nI have been repeating ad nauseam.\nThe reason her sacred powers still won't\nawaken is because she's spending all her\nefforts playing at being a scholar!\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_06	In truth, I understand Zelda's feelings.\nPainfully so.\x0e\x05\0\0 She lost her mother, her\nteacher, before she could learn from her.\nTen pointless years of self-training,\nwithout so much as a book or note\nto help her find her way...\nThose in the castle talk behind her back.\nAnd I, her only family, scold her for\nher shortcomings.\nNo wonder she wishes to hide away in\nher beloved relic research. I'd love\nnothing more than to console her...\nBut I must stay strong. She MUST\nfulfill her duty, just as we all must.\nEven if she comes to despise me.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_07	I have been told my Zelda went to the\nSpring of Wisdom...\n\nThis will likely be her last chance.\nIf she is unable to awaken her power\nat Lanayru, all hope is truly lost.\nIf she comes back without success,\x0e\x05\0\0\nthen I shall speak kindly with her.\nScolding is pointless now.\nI forced 10 years of training on her...\x0e\x05\0\0\nand after all that, it seems her power\nwill stubbornly awaken some other way.\nPerhaps I should encourage her to keep\nresearching her beloved relics. They may\njust lead her to answers I can't provide.\nFor now, I sit anxiously, more a father\nthan a king in this moment. I sit and\nawait my daughter's return.\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x03\0\x04\0\x01\x01

Diary_00	Read Zelda's diary?\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x05\0\x06\0\x01\0\0\x02
Diary_01	After meeting with the Champions, I left\nto research the ancient technology, but\nnothing of note came of my research.\nThe return of Ganon looms—a dark force\ntaunting us from afar. I must learn all I\ncan about the relics so we can stop him.\nIf the fortune-teller's prophecy is to be\nbelieved, there isn't much time left...\n\nAh, but turning over these thoughts in\nmy head puts me ill at ease. I suppose\nI should turn in for the night.\nP.S. Tomorrow my father is assigning\nHIM as my appointed knight...\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_02	I set out for Goron City today to\nmake some adjustments to\nDivine Beast Vah Rudania.\nI still recall feeling his eyes on me as I\nwalked ahead. The feeling stayed with\nme so long, I grew anxious and weary.\nIt is the same feeling I've felt before in\nhis company... And still, not a word\npasses his lips.\nI never know what he's thinking! It makes\nmy imagination run wild, guessing at\nwhat he is thinking but will not say.\nWhat does the boy chosen by the sword\nthat seals the darkness think of me?\nWill I ever truly know?\nThen, I suppose it's simple. A daughter\nof Hyrule's royal family yet unable to\nuse sealing magic... He must despise me.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_03	I said something awful to him today...\n\n\nMy research was going nowhere. I was\nfeeling depressed, and I had told him\nrepeatedly not to accompany me.\nBut he did anyway, as he always does,\nand so I yelled at him without restraint.\n\nHe seemed confused by my anger. I feel\nterribly guilty...and that guilt only makes\nme more agitated than I was before.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_04	I am unsure how to put today's events\ninto words. Words so often evade me\nlately, and now more than ever.\nHe saved me. Without a thought for his\nown life, he protected me from the\nruthless blades of the Yiga Clan.\nThough I've been cold to him all this\ntime...taking my selfish and childish\nanger out on him at every turn...\nStill, he was there for me. I won't ever\nforget that. Tomorrow, I shall apologize\nfor all that has transpired between us.\nAnd then...I will try talking to him.\nTo Link. It's worth a shot.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_05	Bit by bit, I've gotten Link to open up\nto me. It turns out he's quite a glutton.\nHe can't resist a delicious meal!\nWhen I finally got around to asking why\nhe's so quiet all the time, I could tell it\nwas difficult for him to say. But he did.\nWith so much at stake, and so many eyes\nupon him, he feels it necessary to stay\nstrong and to silently bear any burden.\nA feeling I know all too well... For him,\nit has caused him to stop outwardly\nexpressing his thoughts and feelings.\nI always believed him to be simply a\ngifted person who had never faced a\nday of hardship. How wrong I was...\nEveryone has struggles that go unseen\nby the world... I was so absorbed with\nmy own problems, I failed to see his.\nI wish to talk with him more and to see\nwhat lies beneath those calm waters,\nto hear him speak freely and openly...\nAnd perhaps I, too, will be able to bare\nmy soul to him and share the demons\nthat have plagued me all these years.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_06	Father scolded me again today. He told\nme I am to have nothing more to do with\nresearching ancient technology.\nHe insisted that I focus instead on\ntraining that will help me awaken\nmy sealing magic.\nI was so frustrated and ashamed I could\nnot even speak. I've been training since\nI was a child, and yet...\nMother passed the year before my\ntraining was to begin. In losing her,\nI lost not just a mother, but a teacher.\nMother used to smile and tell me,\n"Zelda, my love, all will be well in\nthe end. You can do anything."\nBut she was wrong. No matter how I try\nor how much time passes...the sealing\npower that is my birthright evades me.\nTomorrow I journey with Link to the\nSpring of Power to train. But this, too,\nwill end in failure. Such is my curse.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_07	I had a dream last night... In a place\nconsumed by darkness, a lone woman\ngazed at me, haloed by blinding light.\nI sensed she was...not of this world.\nI don't know if she was a fairy or a\ngoddess, but she was beautiful.\nHer lips spoke urgently, but her voice\ndid not reach me. Would I have heard\nher if my power was awoken?\nOr was my dream simply a manifestation\nof my fears? I am sure I will know the\nanswer soon, whether I wish to or not...\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_08	I turned 17 today. That means this is the\nday I will finally be allowed to train at the\nSpring of Wisdom.\nWhen Link arrives, we will set out for\nMount Lanayru. The other Champions\nwill accompany us there.\nI have not seen my father since he last\nscolded me. Things are too strained\nnow... I will meet with him when I return.\n...\n\n\nActually...I've had a horrible feeling ever\nsince that weird dream. No one would\nbelieve a failure of a princess, but...\nRight now,\x0e\x05\x02\0 for no particular reason,\x0e\x05\x02\0 I am\nfilled with a strange and terrible certainty\nthat something awful is about to happen.\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x03\0\x04\0\x01\x01

Diary_00	Read Zelda's research journal?\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x05\0\x06\0\x01\0\0\x02
Diary_01	Today I met with Impa of the Sheikah\ntribe and began my research into the\nancient technology in earnest.\nImpa introduced me to Purah and\nRobbie, other respected members\nof her tribe. \nTomorrow I embark on an excavation\nwith them.\n\nWe hope to find ancient tech with which\nto operate the Guidance Stones.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_02	Today we uncovered some ancient \ntechnology that we believe may have the\npower to control the Guidance Stone.\nIt is a rectangular object, small enough\nto be held in my two hands. Sheikah\ntext is featured prominently on it.\nIt is made of an unknown material,\nbut we believe it is the same as the\nshrines scattered across each region.\nImpa proposed that I hold on to it for\nnow. I hope that it leads to some new\ndevelopments in our research.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_03	The stone relic we discovered has\nbeen named. We are calling it the\nSheikah Slate.\nWe have not found any mention of a\nname for this object in the records\nwe have unearthed so far...\nNevertheless, Purah insisted we call it\nthe Sheikah Slate, as the relic is a slate\nmade by the Sheikah tribe.\nFeels a bit on the nose to me, but it was\nnot a fight I thought I could win.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_04	We did it. We were finally able to restore\nsome functionality to the Sheikah Slate.\x0e\x05\0\0\n\nWe have discovered that this stone slate\nis capable of producing...images. Perfect\nlikenesses of the things you point it at.\nUnlike normal pictures drawn by hand,\nthis requires no artist to capture\nanything in perfect detail.\nI deeply admire the accomplishments of\nSheikah technology. Still...I know there\nis more to learn. There must be.\nWe believe the Sheikah Slate may have\na function that will allow it to control\nthe Guidance Stone.\nWe must continue our research,\nand quickly.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_05	We have started training the Champions\nwho will pilot the Divine Beasts.\n\nIt may sound rude that I found this\nunexpected, but Mipha mastered\nthe controls with surprising ease.\nDaruk struggled at first but eventually\ngot the hang of it. Urbosa and Revali\nboth managed just fine as well.\nI can finally see the light of hope in our\nfight against the rising Calamity.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_06	Robbie has restored mobility to many of\nthe Guardians we've excavated.\n\n...But we have still yet to find all of the\nGuardians. Records mention a greater\nnumber of them—and even other types.\nThey are said to be stored in five giant\ncolumns that rest beneath Hyrule\nCastle. The thing is...\nNo matter how I search beneath the\ncastle, I can't seem to locate these\ncolumns. They must be buried deep.\nWere they perhaps designed to sense\nthe appearance of Calamity Ganon\nand to only activate upon his return?\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_07	Countless ancient structures are being\ndiscovered across Hyrule...but all\nattempts to enter them have failed.\nRecords indicate that these are facilities\ndesigned to train the hero who is fated\nto combat the Calamity.\nBut the crucial activation mechanism\nremains a mystery. Is the Sheikah Slate\nthe key to activating them?\nThat is Purah's theory, and I concur.\nAnd yet, my experiments so far have\nbeen fruitless.\nStill, we must exhaustively investigate all\nmeans of opposing the Calamity. We must\nnot give up, no matter what!\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Diary_08	I spoke with Purah about the\nShrine of Resurrection we\ndiscovered earlier.\nAs we speculated, this particular\nshrine is, in fact, a medical facility\nwith the power to heal.\nIt also has a long-term stasis function\nthat can be activated and maintained\nuntil healing is complete.\nIn the war against the Calamity 10,000\nyears ago...were the injuries so great\nas to necessitate such a facility?\nIf so, I will remain uneasy until we have\nmade all adjustments necessary to\nrestore it to full working order.\nI can only pray that even if Calamity\nGanon returns, our battle will not require\nthe Shrine of Resurrection's power...\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x03\0\x04\0\x01\x01

Book01	At the request of Hyrule's king,\na group of outsiders came to\ngreet us at the domain.\nOne of them was a Hylian child of\nonly about four years of age.\nHis name was Link.\nHe made quite a first impression. He was\ncurious and full of energy, with a ready\nsmile. Are all Hylian children that way?\nOne thing that surely sets him apart is\nhis swordsmanship, which I hear is\nexceptional. He has even bested adults.\nHe must be somewhat reckless, however,\nas he was covered in bruises. Wishing to\nbe helpful, I healed his wounds for him.\nIt must have been his first time seeing\nhealing magic, as he looked up at me\nwith big, round eyes. It was...adorable.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book02	A Divine Beast was excavated from\nZora's Domain. This one is called\nVah Ruta.\nThe first time I laid eyes on Ruta, I was\nsurprised by how cute it was. It's so big\nand round, with a long, awkward nose.\nAccording to the Sheikah who found\nRuta, Divine Beasts require someone\nworthy to control them.\nIt's fun to imagine someone piloting this\nenormous beast in the distant past.\nI wonder who will have that honor next.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book03	Link came to visit the domain. It feels like\nforever since he was here last. He no\nlonger resembles the child I first met.\nHe is now an accomplished knight and\nkeeper of the sword that seals the\ndarkness. I am so proud. However...\nHe hardly speaks anymore, and smiles\neven more rarely. He is still the kind\nsoul I knew, but something has changed.\nI asked him if something had happened,\nif something was wrong. He merely\nshook his head.\nPerhaps it is his newly acquired height,\nbut I feel he is ever looking past me,\ninto the distance beyond...\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book04	The princess of Hyrule paid a special\nvisit to the domain. She asked me if I\nwould agree to pilot a Divine Beast.\nShe told me she needs my help to face\nthe Calamity. My heart knew at once\nwhat to do. I agreed without reservation.\nCalamity Ganon must not be resurrected.\nIf he is, there is no way to ensure the\nsafety of my people, or of anyone.\nI do not know what will happen. All I\nknow is that if there is anything I can do\nto help, I must try. I must protect Hyrule.\nThere is also that...the Divine Beasts are\nmeant to assist the chosen hero when he\nfaces Ganon. In this way, I can help Link.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book05	Link came to visit me. It had been ages.\nI told him the Lynel of Ploymus Mountain\nhas been terrorizing everyone lately.\nWhen I said that, he started walking\ntoward the mountain, without a word.\nSpellbound, I followed him there.\nWhen we were almost there, he told me\nto turn back. He insisted he would be\nfine on his own. I stubbornly stayed.\nWhile I argued, the Lynel attacked us\nfrom behind! I was sure we had met\nour end. How silly of me to doubt.\nWith a sure hand and a fierce gleam in\nhis eye, Link unsheathed the sword that\nseals the darkness and defeated our foe.\nHis swordsmanship was swift and\ngraceful. I was fascinated by the\nbeauty of his movements.\nThough I should have been terrified,\nI could not help but feel safe in the\npresence of my dear friend.\nHis kindness and determination to help\nthose in need... His strength and skill...\nMy heart is drawn to his. I am doomed.\nThe last beautiful move Link performed\non the mountain is called a Spin Attack.\nPerhaps I will attempt it with my spear.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book06	Father has finally given his blessing for\nme to pilot the Divine Beast. The threat\nof the Calamity can no longer be ignored.\nFather said the Zora must play their part.\nHe seemed on the brink of tears when\nhe made me promise to return unharmed.\nMy eyes burned with tears as well, so I\nsimply nodded. Seggin could hardly\nlook at me. Muzu left partway through.\nI feel awful for putting them through this,\nbut I must do what I can to help Link.\nI could never forgive myself otherwise.\nSpeaking of Link... I have at last finished\ngathering the materials for the armor.\nI shall start making it at once.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book07	Today was the inauguration ceremony\nat Hyrule Castle. It was an honor to\ntake part. However...\nHonestly, I do not remember much\nabout it, but only because something\nunforgettable happened afterward.\nI experienced something wondrous,\na beautiful moment in time I shall\ntreasure forever.\nI am grateful to the princess for agreeing\nto my request, and to Daruk for...um...\nwell, for bringing me closer to Link.\nOh... I did hear something that shocked\nme enough to almost overshadow that\nhappy moment.\nLink has been chosen to guard the\nprincess wherever she goes. They shall...\nbe spending much time together...\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book08	I finally completed that special armor\nfor Link. I am confident it will fit\nhim perfectly.\nHe is coming to the domain soon. I hope\nto give him my gift when I see him, but...\nshould I really go through with it?\nAccording to the old legend, long ago a\nZora princess fell in love with a Hylian\nswordsman. Perhaps there is hope.\nThis will be a rare occasion that Link\nis not accompanying the princess.\nWe should have some time to ourselves.\nOh, I have an idea! At sunset I shall ride\nupon Ruta with Link. Zora princess of\nthe past...please lend me your courage!\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x03\0\x04\0\x01\x01

Book01	I'm gonna start writin' in this "diary"\nthing startin'...now. Ugh, a diary...\nMaybe I'll call it my training journal.\nThey say all ya gotta do is write down\nstuff that happens. Us Gorons prefer the\nsimple life, so I hope simple stuff counts.\nLet's see. For today's journal entry,\nwhat should I write about?\n\nOh, I know! I had some rock roast from\nthe peak of Death Mountain. It was\ndelicious! I think I'll eat more of it soon.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book02	I talked to some Hylians at the base of\nthe mountain. All anyone wants to talk\nabout these days is Calamity Ganon.\nReminds me of when those tiny Sheikah\ncame to Death Mountain a few years ago\nto dig up that Divine Beast or whatever.\nThe Hylians were sayin' that beast thing\nis a weapon someone will need to\nlearn how to control.\nBack in the good ol' days, Gorons didn't\nworry about relics we couldn't eat.\nMmm... Now I'm hungry.\nMaybe I'll track down a prime rock roast\nfor one of my dinners tonight!\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book03	Today I saw someone bein' attacked\nwhen I was out lookin' for lunch rocks\nat the peak.\nHe was a little tiny guy, so I rushed down\nthe mountain to help him. I was shocked\nto find he was handy with a sword!\nBy the time I rolled his way, he'd already\ntaken out all the monsters! I couldn't\nhelp but admire his Goron-like strength.\nWhile I was distracted, a monster almost\ngot the jump on me. He stopped it.\nThe Great Daruk...saved by a tiny Hylian.\nI must have had a dopey look on\nmy face when that happened.\nHope he didn't notice.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book04	That little Hylian from before is named\nLink. He's got a respectable appetite.\nLoves to eat meat, fruit, vegetables...\nall sorts of things a decent person\nwouldn't dream of eating.\n\nLink will cook up and eat just about\nanything. I offered him some Grade A\nrock roast to help refine his palette.\nI asked him how it tasted. He liked it\nso much, he was speechless.\n\nI knew Hylians could eat rocks too.\n\n\nEating isn't the only thing Link and I\nhave in common. The little guy is also\nincredibly strong!\nHe said sometimes when he focuses,\nit feels like time slows down. Heh!\nI really like that guy.\nHe's the type of guy you can trust to\nhave your back and also have a nice\nhearty meal with.\nYeah! That settles it! From now on,\nLink is an official brother.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book05	Hyrule's little princess came to\nGoron City and asked me to pilot\nthe Divine Beast. I said yes.\nThe Great Daruk never turns down\nsomeone in need! When I said I would,\nthe princess seemed really happy.\nThere will be four Champions to control\nfour Divine Beasts, and one swordsman\nto take on Ganon.\nIncluding the princess, our anti-Ganon\nteam is six strong, made up of all\ndifferent kinds of people.\nThis has the makings of an epic feast.\nI got the ball rollin' by giving the\nprincess my best rock roast.\nShe said thanks, but...I think she was\nholdin' back a grimace. Must have had\nsomethin' foul on her mind.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book06	I'm a Champion now. Feels good.\n\n\nI hadn't talked with Link in a while,\nso seeing him at the inauguration\nceremony was nice. It was a good day.\nOh, word has it Link has been chosen as\nZelda's appointed knight. I can't think\nof a better brother for the job.\nI hear one of those ancient machine\nthings went nuts during some test\nand shot out deadly beams!\nWith true Goron spirit, Link grabbed a\npot lid from the ground and deflected\nthe blast.\nHe nailed the thing in its weak spot\nand saved the day.\n\nHis bravery caught the king's eye,\nand not long after that, he was\nappointed to guard Zelda!\nI'd expect nothin' less from the\nlittle guy!\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book07	I've been chosen to pilot Rudania, but I\nwas havin' trouble controlling it. I was\nthe only Champion who was struggling.\nI asked Link for advice, but he just\nshoved me into the Divine Beast so\nI could explore it aimlessly all day.\nI can't explain it, but by the end of\nthe day, I was able to control Rudania\njust how I wanted to!\nI guess experience is the best teacher.\nLittle guy's strength must come from\nworkin' hard and never givin' up.\nGood lesson, brother! As thanks,\nI'm gonna treat him to some gourmet\nsirloin rock.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book08	All my Hylian brother seems to do these\ndays is watch over the tiny princess\nwhile she does her research.\nIt looks like tough work, but the princess\nseems a lot happier and talks more since\nshe's been doin' it, so it must be OK.\nI hear the little guy finally opened up\nabout his troubles to the princess\nwhile they were shovelin' food.\nSurprisingly, she opened up right back.\nSaid somethin' princessy like, "I guess\nwe're the same, you and I."\nHmm... Sounds heavy. They must\nhave been bondin' over their food\npreferences. That'll do it, all right.\nSpeakin' of openin' up, all this journal\nwritin' has made me realize somethin'\nabout myself...\nWriting makes me hungry.\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x03\0\x04\0\x01\x01

Book01	I won another archery competition today.\nAs one would expect, the village can't\nstop talking about my winning streak.\nIn short order, I've managed to break\nall of the previous records and set an\ninsurmountably high bar.\nEverywhere I go I receive praise and\naffirmations that I am the pride of\nthe Rito. I...could get used to this.\nThe elder asked me what I would like as\na prize for my achievements. I told him\nI wish for an archery training ground.\nIf I am to keep this up, I need somewhere\nto train at varying elevations. I'm hoping\nto master a new move I've dreamed up...\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book02	I keep pushing my archery skills to the\nlimit. My dive is ideal, but the ensuing\nascent is not as smooth as I wish it was.\nI must return to the Flight Range again\ntomorrow. There, I will become stronger.\nBetter. I won't rest until I succeed.\nThe Rito children look up to me.\nI hear they wish to start training\nat the Flight Range too.\nPerhaps it's not a bad idea to allow\neveryone to use my training space.\nThese are dangerous times, after all.\nTomorrow I will try a new strategy I've\nbeen devising to control the updraft.\nI refuse to believe it's impossible.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book03	There is a persistent rumor in town\nthat Calamity Ganon's resurrection is\nimminent. It can't be true... Right?\nA few years ago, scientists dug up an\nancient mechanical beast called Medoh.\nIt was supposedly used to fight Ganon.\nHyrule's royal family is in search of\nsomeone to pilot the beast. They say to\ndo so requires something beyond skill.\nThey say one's soul must contain an\nincredible sacred power for a Divine\nBeast to recognize them as master.\nThey should have just asked for me\nby name.\n\nTo control the Divine Beast and defeat\nthe Calamity...would finally allow me to\nprove myself to the world.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book04	Hyrule's princess stopped dawdling and\nasked me to pilot the Divine Beast.\nI asked what our plan is.\nI wish I hadn't. It is completely absurd.\n\n\nThe Divine Beasts are little more than\nbackup for some Hylian knight who has\nthe honor of fighting Calamity Ganon.\nME! A sidekick! I thought of declining,\nbut then she looked me dead in the eye\nand held my gaze as she said...\n"We must protect the precious life of\nthis land from the Calamity's grasp at\nall costs. Hyrule needs you, Revali."\nIt was so corny, I almost died.\nBut I won't soon forget the look in her\neyes. She meant it with all of her heart.\nI thought Hylians only thought of\nthemselves, but I suppose there's\nan exception to every rule.\nI'm going to accept, of course.\nBut out of self-respect, I'm going\nto let her sweat it out a bit longer.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book05	Hyrule's princess is coming by to ask\nfor my answer tomorrow. She will surely\nbe overcome with joy when I accept.\nAnd her timing is exceptional. I am close.\nSo close to mastering my new move and\nshowing everyone what I'm capable of.\nWhen they see it, they'll know without\ndoubt it should be ME fighting Ganon\ninstead of that pathetic knight.\nI can see it now. The king and princess...\nAND the knight...all on their knees,\nbegging me to defeat Ganon for them.\nThey'll say, "Please, Master Revali!\nPlease use your otherworldly skills\nand intellect to defeat Calamity Ganon!"\nI look forward to that day.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book06	I journeyed to Hyrule Castle for an\ninauguration ceremony. I now bear\nthe grand title of "Champion."\nMeaningless pomp, if you ask me. If true\nstrength relied only on title and uniform,\neveryone would be a Champion.\nI do like the blue scarf, though...\n\n\nThat annoyingly silent knight was as\nemotionless as usual. I can never tell\nwhat's on his mind. Likely nothing at all.\nSomehow I can't help but believe the\nstories about him beating adult knights\nin swordplay when he was only a child.\nStill, he doesn't stand a chance against\nme. There is no one alive who can\nkeep up with my aerial combat.\nThat reminds me. It's about time I came\nup with a fitting name for that new move\nI created.\nWhat kind of name would be worthy?\nRevali's...something. Tornado?\nWhirlwind? Masterpiece? Hmm.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book07	The princess came to the village on\nofficial business, along with her shadow,\nthat insufferable knight.\nI tried to talk to him while the princess\nmet with the elder, but he was his usual\nquiet self. Why do people like him so?\nI also gave him the privilege of seeing\nme perform Revali's Gale. Nothing.\nNo reaction at all to my impressive feat.\nI showed it to him even knowing there\nwas a chance of failure, since it's still\nso new. He must truly be slow-witted.\nI tried to provoke him into facing me,\nbut to no avail. It's like talking to\na stone.\nOur interactions were a waste of time,\nso I flew off to find solace with Medoh.\n\nWhat's wrong with that guy?\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book08	Daruk informed me that we have been\nasked to escort the princess to Lanayru.\n\nWe're to see the princess off at dawn at\nthe mountain's base and meet her there\nwhen she returns at sunset.\nMust I participate in this nonsense?\nThough...I still remember that look\non the princess's face.\nWhen she asked me to pilot the Divine\nBeast, she was not only determined...\nshe seemed desperate.\nShe's aware she can't fulfill her\nsacred duties, and anyone can\nsee how it weighs on her.\nIt's difficult for me to comprehend\nthe troubles of the talentless, but...\nI'm trying.\nIt's not that I dislike the princess.\nShe tries her hardest. It's simply\nnot good enough.\nNo, I don't think I can spare the time to\nsend her off in the morning, but perhaps\nI will fly over to greet her at sunset.\nPerhaps that alleged "sealing power"\nwill show her some mercy and finally\nawaken this time.\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x03\0\x04\0\x01\x01

Book01	My dear friend from afar came to visit\nGerudo Town today. It is always a\npleasure to see the queen of Hyrule.\nShe described her reason for coming\nas urgent. She wished for me to meet\nher newborn child.\nHer sweet daughter's name is Zelda.\nShe has her mother's smile. I cannot\nhelp but cherish her already.\nI told her that Zelda is sure to grow up\ninto a dignified and beautiful queen,\njust like her mother.\nMy friend thanked me, but said that looks\nare fleeting, and instead she wishes for\nZelda to be blessed with true happiness.\nThe way she gazes upon her daughter...\nher little bird, as she calls her...I have\nnever seen such unconditional love.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book02	It has been a long while since we laid\nmy dear friend, the queen, to rest.\nI only now have the will to write again.\nIt was so sudden. I still can't believe\nshe is gone.\n\nAll of my sweet memories of her keep\nrunning through my mind. Even now,\nI can hardly keep the tears at bay.\nYoung Zelda kept her head held high\nas she said her final good-bye to her\nmother at the funeral.\nShe carried herself as a true princess,\nbut I can sense the deep grief she is\nhiding within. I worry for her...\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book03	I made a voyage to visit Hyrule.\nAfter speaking with the king, I saw\nZelda for the first time in a year.\nIn truth, it was my concern for her\nthat brought me there.\n\nThe king allowed me to keep her\ncompany as she went to the spring\nfor her training.\nThere, Zelda prayed and prayed in the\nspring's icy waters until the sun set.\n\nI told her many times to stop, but she\nwouldn't listen. I eventually had to\ndrag her out of the water.\nZelda gazed at me for the longest time\nwith heartbreaking vulnerability.\n\nEventually, in a tiny voice, she told me\nof the pressure and panic she feels at\nnot being able to fulfill her sacred duty.\nShe whispered over and over, "Why can I\nnot do as the royal daughters of the past\nhave done? What is wrong with me?" \nAll I could do was hold her close\nand listen... I pray that it is enough.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book04	Emissaries from Hyrule came to see me\ntoday. They informed me that I have been\nchosen to pilot the Divine Beast.\nMy people are uneasy about it. They tell\nme such a dangerous task is not fitting\nfor the chief. I understand their fear.\nHowever, I intend to accept this task.\n\n\nCalamity Ganon's resurrection does not\nonly threaten Hyrule, but the whole\nworld. I refuse to sit idly by.\nGanon is also closely associated\nwith the Gerudo...an association\nI deeply resent.\nI believe Zelda will be here soon to\nreceive my official answer. I am excited\nto see her, as always.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book05	I attended the inauguration ceremony\nalongside the other Champions whom\nI share a fate with.\nZelda, Revali, Mipha, and Link are so\nyoung. They are Hyrule's future. Daruk\nand I hope to help them see that future.\nHowever, one thing did trouble me.\nZelda was...uncharacteristically cold\ntoward Link. I can imagine why.\nI hear Link has been assigned as Zelda's\nguardian knight. I hope they find a way\nto get along.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book06	Link requested to meet with me today.\n\n\nHe tells me Zelda exploited our law\nthat restricts men from entering town\nto slip away from him.\nI told him of a trick that would allow him\nentrance, and he was able to get in.\nBy then, however, Zelda was long gone.\nI promised to let him know if I saw her,\nso he reluctantly returned home.\n\nIn a similar yet distinct way, Link seems\nto have trouble expressing himself.\n\nPerhaps the two can help each other...\nThat is, if she ever gives him the chance.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book07	Today I accompanied Zelda as she went\nto research Naboris. When the sun set,\nthe poor, exhausted girl drifted to sleep.\nI sent word to Link, who showed up\nat Naboris faster than I expected.\n\nAlthough it is none of my business, I felt\nthe least I could do to bridge their gap\nwas to share some things about Zelda.\nThe rest is up to them.\x0e\x01\x05\x08\x02\0\x03\0\x04\0\0\x02
Book08	I am so happy to say that Zelda smiles\nmuch more often lately. It seems she and\nLink have finally learned to get along.\nI hope this will have a positive effect on\nher training. However...I am concerned\nwe may be running out of time.\nWhenever I hear of monster attacks\nor other unusual events plaguing\nthe kingdom, my concern grows.\nAll I can do is pray that Zelda...\nmy little bird...has enough time.\n\nI do not pray to the goddesses, but to\nher mother. My dearest friend...\nHow I miss her.\x0e\x01\x04\x06\x03\0\x04\0\x01\x01

0110	Upon returning from a field survey, Zelda shows\nLink Mount Lanayru towering in the distance...\nZelda commits to going to the mountain to\ninitiate the sacred rites that may awaken her\nhidden power there.
0111	While Zelda and Link seek refuge from the rain\nbeneath a tree, she opens up to Link about\nher own doubts and the choices she has made.

0118	Zelda tracks down Rito warrior Revali and enlists\nhim to pilot the Divine Beast Vah Medoh.\nDuring their encounter, she witnesses an\nimpressive display of his archery skills,\nas well as the hidden side of his personality\nthat makes it all possible.
0119	Zelda enlists Daruk, the mightiest Goron,\nto pilot the Divine Beast Vah Rudania.\nAlthough he fearlessly fights off hordes\nof monsters with great courage, he has\nan unexpected weakness.
0120	Zelda visits the Zora princess, Mipha,\nand enlists her to pilot the Divine Beast\nVah Ruta. While teaching her brother Sidon\nto swim up waterfalls, Mipha entrusts him with\nthe duty of the Zora royal family, displaying\nher dedication as both princess and sister.
0121	Zelda entreats Urbosa, the Gerudo chief, to pilot\nthe Divine Beast Vah Naboris. After Urbosa\nformally accepts, the two companions take a\nnighttime stroll in the desert, and Urbosa\nshares cherished memories from their\nshared past.
