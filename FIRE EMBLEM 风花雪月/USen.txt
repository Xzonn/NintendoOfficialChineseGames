4883	She who was graced with the holy word of the divine goddess,\nwho bore witness to her magnificence, is the one called Seiros.\nShe is the messenger of the heavens, the bridge between the lands\nabove and below, and her blessings shall bring tidings of peace to all.
4884	With the goddess's omnipotence and wisdom to guide her,\nSeiros ensures that her will be done.\nAs the goddess's sword, Seiros wards away evil.\nAs the goddess's child, Seiros makes emperors of mortals.\nAs the goddess's wings, Seiros elevates her people.\nAs the goddess's voice, Seiros spreads the word of love.
4885	That sublime sword is entrusted to you.\nThose emperors are crowned before you.\nThose wings clear your path.\nThat voice whispers words of trust.\nMay the blessings of the goddess follow you, always.
4886	The Creation\nIn the beginning, amid the great cloudless ocean, F√≥dlan came to be.\nAt the end of a long journey, the goddess glimpsed that land and there\nalighted. Upon that sacred ground, she breathed life into the world and\ncreated all of the creatures upon it.
4887	By the goddess's hand, plants took root, birds took to the sky,\nand animals roamed the land. Last of all, she created humanity.\nWhen the humans wished for power, she granted it. She gifted them\nthe blessings of the heavens and of the earth. By way of the magical arts,\nhumanity attained great power, yet unaware that great power portends\ngreat evil.
4888	By the grace of the goddess's divine protection, humanity thrived.\nThrough her blessings, they grew prosperous and their numbers rose.\nBefore long they became the most powerful creatures in all of F√≥dlan.\nAll was well until darkness descended from the north...a darkness that\ndevoured the earth, desecrated the heavens, and threw the world and\nits inhabitants into a state of chaos.
4889	To face this evil force, the goddess created a new well of power.\nShe gifted certain chosen individuals with sacred blood, allowing them\nto wield mystical weapons, that they may prevail against the darkness.\nThese souls, buoyed by their divine gifts, conquered the evil ones and\ndrove them back to the north. They came to be known as Heroes.
4890	The Heroes experienced unnaturally long lives, persisting for hundreds\nof years.

4891	The descendants of the Heroes sought their ancestor's power, and thusly\ntheir blood. In time, they amassed Crests, Relics, land, and wealth,\nusing all to set the land aflame with war. The goddess's power, intended\nto stem the flow of evil, became a tool of destruction, all because of the\ngreed of humanity. The goddess grieved and, heartbroken, hid herself\nin the heavens from whence she came...
4892	Under the tyranny of ruthless disorder, the people endured a long period\nof suffering. The vile Nemesis, who proclaimed himself the King of\nLiberation, delighted in war and bloodshed.

4914	House Hresvelg\nThe most distinguished noble house of the Empire, tracing its roots all\nthe way back to Great Emperor Wilhelm. It has been the governing\nhouse of the Empire for 1,100 years. In addition to the first emperor,\nits lineage is also traced back to Saint Seiros herself, which is why\ngenerations of emperors are believed to bear the Crest of Seiros.
4915	House Hresvelg resides in Enbarr, the Imperial Capital, claiming all of\nthe surrounding territory as its domain. It boasted supreme authority\nboth within the Empire and without until the Insurrection of the Seven\nin 1171, in which much of its power was stripped away by the nobility.\nIn recent years, a series of misfortunes has plagued this storied house,\nand some believe dark clouds hover over the future of the Hresvelg reign.
4916	House Aegir\nA house of dukes possessing great power within the Empire, second only\nto House Hresvelg. The head of the house came to occupy the post of\nprime minister, rendering the title a hereditary one thereafter.\nHouse Aegir led the Insurrection of the Seven and, in many ways,\nholds the true power governing the Empire.
4917	House Vestra\nA house of marquises without a domain, existing in the shadow of House\nHresvelg. In addition to managing the darker tasks of the Empire, it is\nresponsible for the emperor's periphery affairs, including coordinating\nthings such as ceremonies and rituals, Imperial consorts, and the Imperial\nGuard. House Vestra was allied with House Aegir in the Insurrection.
4918	House Hevring\nA house of counts that has inherited rule over the Empire's domestic\naffairs, particularly those relating to administration, finance, and the\njudiciary.

4919	House Bergliez\nA house of counts that has inherited rule over the Empire's Ministry of\nMilitary Affairs. It commands all of the armies that do not directly belong\nto the emperor. During times of war, the head of the house becomes the\nImperial army's commander-in-chief. Their territory encompasses most\nof the Empire's main breadbasket, Gronder Field.
4920	House Varley\nA house of counts that has inherited rule over the Empire's Ministry of\nReligion, whose main responsibility is to maintain amiable relations with\nthe Church of Seiros.

Though\ncomplicit in the Insurrection, it remains distant from associated houses.
4923	House Arundel\nFormerly a minor noble house of the Empire. As head of the house,\nwhen Volkhard's younger sister became betrothed to Emperor Ionius IX,\nVolkhard was granted the title of Lord Arundel. Having worked closely\nwith House Aegir, House Arundel is seen as one of the chief instigators\nof the Insurrection of the Seven.
4924	House Hrym\nA house of Imperial viscounts. Resisting Emperor Ionius IX's policy\nof power centralization, it set out to join the Alliance and secure\nindependence from the Empire, but was unable to overcome the\nImperial army's intervention. In the aftermath, the house's main genetic\nline was wiped out. Its current head of house is an adoptee.
4925	House Nuvelle\nA house of Imperial viscounts with territory on the western coast of the\nEmpire, centered around its namesake harbor city of Nuvelle. The house\nflourished thanks to commerce with Dagda, Albinea, Brigid, and other\nterritories.

They have held the esteemed responsibility\nof leading the Alliance roundtable ever since.
4930	The position of this house of dukes relies on the noble rank bestowed\nupon it by the Kingdom, well before the Alliance's founding. The current\nDuke Riegan's heir, Godfrey, died in an accident while on duty. While he\ndid leave behind a surviving daughter, she is presently unaccounted for.
4931	House Goneril\nDescendants of one of the 10 Elites, it is a military house that is chiefly\ntasked with military strikes and defense against the Almyran army, mostly\ndue to its territory's position in the east. Lord Holst, the next head of\nthe house, is widely renowned as the Alliance's bravest general.

4933	House Gloucester\nDescendants of one of the 10 Elites, this house of counts hails from\nsouthern Leicester territory.

4934	House Edmund\nA house of margraves with land in the north of Leicester territory.\nIts beneficial trade policies, emphasizing fair use of its personal harbors,\nhave awarded the house a great deal of clout, to such a degree that it\nwas eventually accepted into the ranks of the Five Great Lords of the\nAlliance. Their current head of house is a renowned orator.
4935	House Daphnel\nDescendants of one of the 10 Elites and formerly among the Five Great\nLords of the Alliance, it lost much power due to internal discord.

4937	House Blaiddyd\nThis house claims Blaiddyd of the 10 Elites as its ancestor.

This secured\nthe Kingdom's independence from the Adrestian Empire, after which\nLoog was crowned as its inaugural king by the Church of Seiros.
4938	House Blaiddyd resides in Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital, claiming all of\nthe surrounding territory as its domain and many of the fiefdoms in the\nnorth of F√≥dlan as its vassals. With the passing of King Lambert in 1176,\nhis older brother, Grand Duke Rufus of Itha, assumed the burden of\nruling the Kingdom in the young crown prince's stead. Even still,\nstrife and disorder continue to plague the land.
4939	House Fraldarius\nThis house of dukes claims Fraldarius of the 10 Elites as its ancestor.\nIt is one of the most ancient houses on record, even amongst Kingdom\nnobility. It is said that Kyphon, the sworn friend of Loog, the King\nof Lions, was also related to the Hero Fraldarius.

4942	House Galatea\nWhen House Daphnel, once a cornerstone of the Leicester Alliance,\nwas divided in two over an inheritance feud, half of them defected to\nFaerghus and established House Galatea, which was granted the noble\ntitle of count.

Its people maintain a strong\nlegacy of horsemanship and relish in the thrill of battle. This vast\nkingdom is rich in fertile prairies, deserts, and mountain ranges.
4947	Albinea\nA continent to the northwest of F√≥dlan. Its frigid climate is home to\nnumerous rare and valuable species of flora and fauna. However,\nthe human population there is extremely small due to the intense cold\nand the frozen earth, which is unsuitable for growing grains or other\nfood crops.
4948	Morfis\nMorfis is the name of a metropolis of magic to the southeast of F√≥dlan,\nas well¬†as the boundless desert that surrounds it.¬†In the¬†distant past, it was\ncalled the City of Illusion. Thanks to an intricate web of trading routes,\nrumors of its profound and mysterious magic continue¬†to spread.
4949	Dagda\nA continent to the southwest of F√≥dlan. Due to its extreme distance from\nF√≥dlan, rumors of this relatively unknown world abound.

4953	Duscur\nA peninsula to the north of F√≥dlan and the west of Sreng. The people\nwho once inhabited this area were decimated, and it now falls under the\ndominion of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus.

11153	I usually enjoy sweets, but the traditional cakes from\nEnbarr are a bit much for my taste. How could those have\npossibly become a traditional dessert?

11157	I often overhear people commenting about how strange\nI am. I don't really get it. Shouldn't it be expected that\neveryone has their own unique perspective on life?
11158	I see it all the time. Someone falls for a scheme and then\ngets angry about it. But rather than being mad at the\nschemer, shouldn't they be busy plotting their revenge?
11159	Nothing surpasses the Hresvelg Treatise on War as a\ngeneral study on strategy, but what book best covers\nlocal tactics?
11160	Despite my appearance, I have long wished to be a Pegasus\nKnight that I may indulge in the lofty view. Yet that dream\nhas always seemed out of reach. Can you guess why?
11161	The tea here does absolutely nothing for me. I could send\nfor some supplies from home, but is there truly not a soul\nin this place with tea fit for a noble?

11163	I've slept almost everywhere in this monastery, but lately\nI've been wanting to try sleeping outdoors. Do you know\nsomewhere I could sleep under the stars?

11165	You know, I don't even care when people say I'm short.\nBut I'm definitely open to suggestions if you know of a\nquick way to grow!
11166	I feel like the tough fighters who become legends mostly\nuse swords and lances. Are those really the weapons you\nhave to wield if you want to make your mark on history?
11167	Life would be so much easier if no one had to talk\nface-to-face. Isn't written correspondence like this really\nthe best form of communication? Or face-to-door chats?

11172	The library is a place I favor, but I am having a problem.\nIt is lacking sufficient information about Brigid! I have\nthe hope that I can be fixing this problem.
11173	When I was in the greenhouse earlier, a female student\nfled from me as if in terror. Why did she do that? I was\nonly tending the flowers.
11174	I am always looking to assist His Highness, but sometimes\nI find myself at a loss. What more can I do?
11175	Words cannot express my disgust with the students here.\nSo many of these fools rely on their noble status or their\nCrest's power as an excuse to shirk their training.
11176	My fellow students have called me dour. They say I should\njoke around more often. But what's the point in that?
11177	I'd like to borrow a book from the library, but there are\nso many to choose from that I can't decide. Do you have\nany recommendations?
11178	I've never been very good at arithmetic, but I can see how\nit would be a great skill to have when negotiating with\nmerchants. How do I make it easier to learn?
11179	I wonder if I'll ever find a partner who understands I don't\nmean any harm when I flirt with others. Does someone\nlike that really exist?

11183	I'm trying to read any book about reason I can get my\nhands on, but now and again, I'll come across one that's\nwritten in a foreign language. How can I read those?
11184	When I get into a rhythm while cleaning, I always end up\nsinging a song that I make up on the spot. It's so\nembarrassing when someone hears me! What should I do?
11185	I want to make someone change his boorish behavior,\nbut he doesn't seem to care no matter how much I urge\nhim to reconsider his actions. I'm at my wits' end!
11186	Meat and vegetables are both delicious, but some people\ncomplain about not liking one or the other. I just don't\nunderstand how anyone can snub a good meal!
11187	If I told you I was searching for someone who might like to\nshare a cup of tea with an elegant noble, whose name\nwould come to mind?
11188	I typically decorate with red roses when I host a tea party,\nbut lately I am considering the virtues of variety. Do you\nhave any thoughts about other flowers I might try?
11189	Classroom learning isn't enough to become a strong\nknight! There's got to be someone around here who\ncan teach me how to get as strong as possible!
11190	I've looked at the notes in this box before, and it seems like\neveryone's always worried and complaining about stuff!\nIs everyone really that bad off?
11191	I have some experience painting landscapes, and now I'd\nlike to try my hand at portraiture. Can you think of\nanyone who would model for me?
11192	I found a wonderful painting at a shop in town. What a\nshame keeping this masterpiece all to myself! Can you\nthink of an art lover in Garreg Mach I could share it with?
11193	Everyone treats me like a child. Please do something\nabout it.
11194	I often hear ridiculous rumors about ghosts appearing in\nthe monastery. It's nonsense and it's disrupting my studies.\nThere aren't really ghosts, are there?
11195	I'm not good at talking to others. I can talk to birds,\nhorses, and other animals just fine, but when it comes\nto people, I freeze up.
11196	I'm not good at cleaning up. I try my best, but before I\nknow it, everything's messy again.
11197	I'm supposed to write a letter to my brother to let him\nknow how I'm doing. But there's nothing that I want to\nwrite about, and on top of that, it's just too much work.
11198	It's my turn to clean, but I'm feeling under the weather.\nEven writing this note is a strain! I need to get someone\nelse to do my cleaning for me. Who should I ask?
11199	There's someone I just can't seem to beat. What's a quick\nand easy way to make them give up and say uncle?
11200	Let me just ask you straight. What do you think makes a\ngreat mercenary?

11202	What can I do to ensure that an independently-minded\nyoung woman does not fall into harm's way?
11203	Whenever I go for a walk, I get this strange feeling that\nsomeone is watching me. Who could it be?
11204	I wish to make more friends, but my brother always\ninterferes. How can I get him to back off?
11205	There's someone whose Crest I wish to study. I've asked\nmany times, but I can't get them to consent. There must be\nsome way to persuade them.
11206	There is a person with whom I do not get along.\nChildish as it may sound, we always end up quarreling.\nIs there nothing I can do to remedy this?
11207	There are as many men in the world as there are stars in\nthe sky, but you meet so few good men during your time\non this planet. How does one meet a worthy partner?

11209	I've reunited with my daughter after years of being apart,\nbut I'm the one who left her in the first place. I don't know\nwhat to say, or even how to speak to her.
11210	It's standard practice for a general not to stand on the\nfront lines. What should I do when I see him deliberately\nignoring this rule at the risk of his own life?
11211	If you feel overwhelmed by teaching, just ask me for help.\nI predict that guiding these imps through their teenage\nyears will be IMPortant for F√≥dlan's future. Ha! Get it?
11212	Flayn is an interesting young lady, but keep your distance.\nSeteth's quite protective, and you wouldn't want to fan the\nflames of his wrath‚Äîor should I say, fan the Flayns!
11213	There's a new place in town that I hear has some really\ntasty food. I asked them to hold two seats under my name,\nbut I don't know who I should go with.
11214	A professor's job seems so repetitive. It's the same thing\nday after day after day. I used to be interested in teaching,\nbut it seems way too boring for someone like me.
11215	It's been a turbulent year.
11216	I don't like interfering in squabbles between noble brats,\nbut the parents complain if I don't. It's annoying.
11217	(There's just a drawing of a what looks like a broken vase.)
11218	(There's just a drawing of what looks like a student\nthrowing trash on the ground.)
11219	When I see the students enthusiastically eating together in\nthe dining hall, I sometimes wish to join them. I wonder if\nthat would be a bother.
11220	I am more than capable of protecting myself from ruffians,\nbut those around me tend to worry, and so I am often\ndenied the pleasure of a private stroll.
11221	I have as many worries as anyone else, but I must always\nfeign dauntlessness. It can be rather taxing at times.
11222	I am occasionally asked to attend tea parties, but in truth,\nI do not care for hot beverages. I have considered waiting\nuntil it cools to drink, but I fear that would seem rude.
11223	I understand the risk of fighting on the front lines, but I\nsimply must be out there to lead my troops. Is there\nsome way I could reduce the danger?

11231	Growing out my hair was not intentional. I was busy with\nother things in life, so I never thought to get it cut. It hurts\nthat others think I grew my hair out to be fashionable.
11232	Nobles must never lose their composure. We must always\nexude an aura of grace. That said, is it necessary for us to\nbe graceful on the battlefield as well?
11233	I used to think it foolish to cover one's face in battle with\na mask or helmet, but it actually may not be that bad.\nIt means you don't have to look your opponent in the eye.
11234	In the past, I would nearly pass out if I got splattered by\nan enemy's blood. Nowadays I remain entirely conscious,\neven if my face is drenched in blood. It's disgusting.
11235	I hate having to be sneaky and stay quiet when an enemy\nis in my line of sight. It's not that I can't do it, but I don't\nthink I'm cut out for ambushes and stuff like that.
11236	What are all these knight lovers talking about when they\ngo on and on about chivalry? Maybe I don't get it because\nI don't care about being a knight.
11237	I trip all the time, but what if I trip on the battlefield?\nWill I die? I'm probably going to die.
11238	I thought being a noble meant having some sway in life.\nI thought if I told people I wanted to stay locked up in\nmy room, they'd leave me be.
11239	What's the difference between killing someone and calling\nfor their death instead? In both situations, their blood is on\nyour hands, so isn't it all the same?
11240	If someone is having trouble falling asleep, you could sing\nthem a lullaby, but you can't really do that for yourself.\nIs there anything you can do to help yourself fall asleep?
11241	I have attained great skill at writing this language,\nbut speaking it still gives me difficulty. Can you\nprovide me with advice for achieving mastery of this?
11242	Garreg Mach is surrounded by the abundance of nature,\nbut securing provisions during times of warring can still\nbe difficult. This is different from my land of home...
11243	How can I convince someone who is working himself sick\nto take a break?
11244	Animals have never been fond of me. Even warhorses and\nwyverns are put off by my countenance. What can I do?
11245	Once, as a boy, I struck my father. Now that I think back\non it, he must have been upset at the time. I wish that I\ncould go back and apologize to him.

11248	My dream of becoming a proper knight still feels so far off.\nWhat can I do to realize my full potential?
11249	I'm weary from this ceaseless fighting. I wonder if I'll ever\nmeet a kind, beautiful young lady who can cure my\nhardened heart.
11250	All we do is battle. The fighting never stops, and it's\nturning everyone's disposition dour. Even the ladies!\nWe should throw a banquet to lift everyone's spirit.
11251	I've always hated exercising and avoided training, but now\nI'm afraid that I may be holding everyone back. Is there\nanything I can do to help support my allies?
11252	I really start craving sweets when I'm tired or stressed out.\nI wish there was some kind of yummy confection that I\ncould make with the limited ingredients available to us.
11253	Everyone who hears the songs I make up laughs and says\nthey're funny, but they're not supposed to be humorous!\nWhat's so funny about my lyrics?
11254	Sometimes I make really, really big mistakes. But I can't\nafford to make mistakes on the battlefield, you know?\nIsn't there a way for me to fix that?
11255	Isn't there a way to turn withered, barren land into soil\nthat is rich and abundant with crops? It pains my heart\nto see people dying of starvation.

11257	I have been searching for an ideal wife with whom to start\na family for years now. How long must I wait?
11258	A prominent noble ought to possess a few quality pieces\nof art. What sort of work would best suit me?
11259	People always say that my muscles are huge, but I'm still\nnot satisfied! It would be way better if my muscles were\neven huger, right?
11260	I'm writing a letter to my little sis, and I want to send her\na present, but I never know what to send. What kind of\ngift do you think would make her happy?
11261	I have a burning ambition, but making it come true would\nmean betraying my parents' wishes. I'm not courageous\nenough to persuade them. What should I do?
11262	Some structures on the battlefield are centuries old.\nThey are at once historical relics and works of art. What a\nshame it would be if any were damaged amid the fighting.
11263	Every day is filled with nothing but the harshness of war.\nMy only solace is eating sweets. Is that childish of me?
11264	I don't have time to leisurely wait for the future. Even if\nit means resorting to violence, I want to end this war as\nsoon as possible. Is that selfish of me?
11265	My dear friend has been behaving strangely. He doesn't\nseem to have much of an appetite, and he's been neighing\nless often. I'm afraid he may be sick.
11266	I want to be helpful, but I lack the self-confidence to do so.\nIt is OK for someone like me to be here, or should I leave?
11267	Some people want to make a difference by fighting on the\nfront lines, but there are those of us who want to provide\nsupport from the back. Don't you think we're heroes too?
11268	My friend's birthday is coming up, and I want to make her\na gift. What would be better, a hair clip or a necklace?
11269	Someone I care about has been working so hard that I'm\nworried they might collapse from exhaustion. Is there\nanything I can do?
11270	My hair's longer than it used to be. I don't care much what\nthe guys think, but I'm still curious if it looks good on me.
11271	I have concerns about allowing a young woman still on the\ncusp of adulthood to spend time alone with members of\nthe opposite sex. What are your thoughts?
11272	I am composing a record of our battles, for posterity's sake.\nWhen was it that the Flame Emperor first appeared to us?
11273	I fear falling asleep at night. I worry that I will not awaken\nfor many years, and that when I do, all of my friends will\nbe gone.
11274	I am interested in cooking, but I can't seem to get any\nbetter at it. What should I do to improve my cooking?
11275	It is, of course, necessary to keep one's quarters nice and\ntidy. I wish that the battlefield could be tidy as well, but I\nknow that is a hopeless wish.
11276	I fear that I may not be able to achieve my dream within\nmy lifetime. Therefore, I must find up a worthy successor.\nWherever will I locate such a fervent youth?
11277	Sometimes I think that living like I do, single but\nsurrounded by talented youths, might not be such\na lonely life after all. After all, I'm not lonely. Really.
11278	In an attempt to clean my room, I tried to throw out the\nthings I no longer need, but I can't bring myself to do it.\nAfter all, I can't just throw away precious memories, right?
11279	I wonder if a day will come when both the monastery and\nFaerghus are restored to their former glory.
11280	I wrote a letter to my wife back home, but now I can't\nbring myself to send it.
11281	I hope to improve my riding skills before our next battle.\nAny suggestions for where to begin? I want people to see\nme on horseback and say, "He reins supreme!"
11282	No joke‚ÄîI've lost the book where I write all my puns.\nI can't ink of anywhere I word have left it! Quill you help\nme recover it?
11283	We've been without Lady Rhea for more than five years.\nEvery time the sun rises, I feel a little more accustomed to\nher absence. I hate it! I know she's still alive. She must be.
11284	I'd like to have a duel with you where we're both giving it\nour all, but I suspect if we crossed blades without holding\nanything back, one of us would end up dead.
11285	I appreciate ruined buildings. They symbolize that no\nhome is permanent.
11286	A subordinate is down because they failed a recon mission.\nMaking it back alive should be reward enough. How can I\nconvince them of this?
11287	I hate that I couldn't protect Lady Rhea five years ago.\nI need to get stronger.
11288	I'm so busy working that I don't have time to train.\nBut I want to do my job right. What should I do?

11698	Don't worry about it. It's all in the past.
11699	War will always exist.
11700	If you thought it was a ghost, then it probably was.
11701	Eat, train, study, sleep, repeat.
11702	A woman like that wouldn't go for you.
11703	How selfless of you.
11704	You should do some special training to catch up.
11705	You'll just have to learn to live without sweets.
11706	Maybe they're weird.
11707	You're a mistake maker. Accept it as one of your quirks.
11708	Maybe there's a crop that can grow on withered land.
11709	Go chat up some cute boys.
11710	Possibly forever.
11711	A portrait of yourself.
11712	People with small muscles can be strong too.

11714	You'll just have to accept your fate.
11715	There's nothing you can do about it.
11716	Be careful not to overindulge.
11717	Let's just do our best out there.
11718	Give him some nutritious hay.
11719	That's up to you. Give it some thought.
11720	It would have been better if you hadn't told me that.
11721	You should give her something more useful.
11722	You're worried about me?
11723	Nobody will care either way.
11724	She will resent you if you interfere too much.
11725	The battle at the Red Canyon.
11726	Try hugging a stuffed animal if you're afraid.
11727	It's the thought that counts.
11728	You can't avoid dirt on the battlefield.
11729	Look in Morfis, the City of Illusion.
11730	You're like a mother to everyone around you.
11731	Seal your past in your current room and find a new one.
11732	It's possible. Just be patient.
11733	If you're wavering, it's better to not send it.
11734	You're out of time. The next battle awaits us.
11735	We're probably all better off without it.
11736	It's probably good that you've gotten used to it.
11737	The Heroes' Relics truly are that powerful.
11738	What if we just destroyed them all and rebuilt them?
11739	You can't. Why waste your breath on a defeatist?
11740	Kindness is more important than strength.
11741	You'll just have to cut down on your sleeping time.

13360	S0 fought alongside Edelgard to bring\nan end to the tyranny of a godlike being. Though EK00heEL00sheEM00\nwas wounded in the battle and lost the power of the\nprogenitor god, EK00heEL00sheEM00 remained determined to walk EK00hisEL00herEM00\ndestined path. With EK00hisEL00herEM00 legendary blade in hand,\nEK00heEL00sheEM00 will never stop standing against those who slither\nin the dark until F√≥dlan at last knows everlasting peace.
13361	S0 defeated those who slither in the dark\nand put down the crazed Immaculate One. In the\naftermath of the loss of F√≥dlan's great leading figures,\nEK00heEL00sheEM00 ascended the throne as the first leader of the\nUnited Kingdom of F√≥dlan. In EK00hisEL00herEM00 heart lived the\nindelible hope that their efforts would one day yield\nan era in which the people knew true peace and the\nhorrors of war were a hazy memory of the past.
13362	S0 helped Dimitri to finally crush the\nambitions of the Empire. After the war, Rhea stepped\ndown from her role as archbishop, and S0\nswore to lead the Church of Seiros in her stead.\nEK00HeEL00SheEM00 helped to guide the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus\nas it brought leadership to the newly unified F√≥dlan\nand worked tirelessly to create a peaceful world\nfree from the shackles of oppression.
13363	Together, S0 and Claude sent the Fell King\nNemesis, a foe from a bygone age, back to the flames of\neternity from whence he came. Afterward, Claude left\nF√≥dlan, leaving S0 to ascend the throne\nas the first leader of the United Kingdom of F√≥dlan.\nAs he took his schemes and dreams and efforts to a\nfar-off land, he hoped dearly that their joint efforts\nwould one day allow for a world where all of humanity\ncan coexist in peace and harmony, regardless of\nborders or bloodlines.
13364	As the new Adrestian emperor, Edelgard dedicated her life\nto reshaping the delicate political structure of F√≥dlan.\nWith tireless work and great sacrifice, she reformed\nthe class system to ensure a free and independent society\nfor all. In her later years, she entrusted her life's work\nto a worthy successor before finally vanishing from the\npublic eye.
13365	After his coronation, Dimitri spent his life reforming and\nruling justly over F√≥dlan. He focused particularly on\nimproving living situations for orphans and improving\nforeign relations. He was known for listening intently to\nthe voices of all, and for instituting a new form of\ngovernment in which the people were free to be active\nparticipants. He lived for his people and alongside them,\nand was thusly dubbed the Savior King.
13366	Claude returned to his homeland of Almyra and assumed\nthe role of a politically active prince. After inheriting the\nthrone, he worked to improve relations with F√≥dlan.\nIn addition to establishing new trade routes, he fostered\ntrust by sending reinforcements into F√≥dlan to help quell\nrevolts by the remnants of the Imperial loyalists. Under his\nguidance, the peoples of F√≥dlan and Almyra were finally\nable to set aside age-old prejudices, and over time,\nthe fallacies of old were all but forgotten.
13367	Hubert devoted his life fully to the service of Edelgard.\nOperating in the light and the shadows alike, he disposed\nof countless burdens facing his emperor, using any means\nnecessary. Though his ghastly appearance and imposing\ndemeanor were ever feared, he paid his reputation little\nheed, focusing instead on his loyalty to the emperor.
13368	After officially becoming the new Duke Aegir, Ferdinand\nset about reforming his territory. He overcame numerous\nobstacles to help the lands of Aegir recover. To recognize\nhis contributions during and after the war, the emperor\nappointed him as the new prime minister. Thereafter,\nhe stayed by Edelgard's side to help the Empire achieve\ngreat prosperity.
13369	After reclaiming the title of Duke Aegir, Ferdinand set\nabout reforming his territory. He overcame numerous\nobstacles to help the lands of Aegir recover, and in\nrecognition of those achievements, he was invited to\ntake part in helping to govern all of F√≥dlan.
13370	Linhardt abandoned his inherited position in favor of a\ncarefree life at Garreg Mach Monastery. There he spent\nhis days at ease, wiling away the hours at the fishing pond\nor in his private study. After his passing, a treasure trove\nof documents was unearthed, revealing the key discoveries\nhe had made during his many years of Crest research.
13371	In recognition of his achievements during the war, Caspar\nwas given the title of Minister of Military Affairs in the\nnew Adrestian Empire. Though his command developed a\nreputation for occasional recklessness, he proved an able\nleader, guiding his troops to overcome countless obstacles.\nLong after his career had ended, tall tales of the glory and\ngood cheer that he brought to his army endured.
13372	After the war, Caspar set out alone on a journey of\nself-discovery. He traveled to every corner of F√≥dlan and\neven ventured abroad now and again. It is said that he got\ninto mischief at every turn but that the victims of his\nantics, always more amused than harmed or offended,\nremembered him fondly and passed those stories on to\nfuture generations.
13373	As soon as Bernadetta inherited House Varley from her\nfather, she withdrew from all political discourse and\nfocused solely on the management of her own territory.\nBecause of this and her penchant for spending long\nperiods of time in "hibernation," she became known\nthroughout the house's history as the "Bear of Varley."
13374	Dorothea returned to the Mittelfrank Opera as soon as the\nwar was over. Thanks to her talent, the company enjoyed a\nresurgence in popularity that lasted well beyond the end\nof her own career. Once she gave up her position as a\nsongstress, she settled down to a private life of peace and\nquiet. It is said that she was very happily married.
13375	Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid and inherited\nthe throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared\nindependence from F√≥dlan and worked tirelessly to secure\nfriendly relations with both F√≥dlan and Dagda. Her efforts\ninspired her descendants to carry the torch she lit,\nensuring a future of peace and prosperity for her people.
13376	As a loyal vassal, Dedue dedicated his life to supporting\nKing Dimitri through his entire reign. After tending to his\nliege on his deathbed, Dedue resumed his post at Dimitri's\ngrave on the edge of Fhirdiad. There, it is said he stood\nsentinel over the peaceful realm he had helped build until\nthe end of his days.
13377	As Duke Fraldarius, Felix worked for years to revitalize\nand rebuild his territory. He became the king's right-hand\nman, serving as a trusted adviser on a range of subjects,\nespecially military affairs. Later in his life, he inherited his\nfather's nickname and was known throughout the\nKingdom as the Shield of Faerghus's worthy successor.
13378	Even after the war's end, skirmishes continued to break\nout across F√≥dlan. Bored and restless in his capacity as\nDuke Fraldarius, Felix abandoned his title, jumping at\nthe opportunity to wield a sword again. Little is known\nof his whereabouts thereafter, but even many years later,\nsoldiers continued to whisper rumors of a mysterious man\nable to deal swift death to scores of enemies.
13379	After the war, Ashe was formally knighted and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nHis warm, sincere attitude toward his subjects was praised\nall over F√≥dlan, and Ashe was finally recognized as the\nideal knight he'd always hoped to be. His deeds live on\nin countless tales.
13380	As Margrave Gautier, Sylvain devoted his life to improving\nrelations with the people of the Sreng region. With oration\nalone, he succeeded in helping to create a new way of life\nfor nobles in which Relics and Crests were no longer\nviewed as necessary. Though he went down in history as\nan extraordinary lord, it nevertheless became customary\nto refer to cheaters as "sons of Gautier."
13381	Mercedes left home and opened a small orphanage in\nthe Faerghus region with her mother. There, she took in\nand raised children who had lost their families in the war,\nregardless of their blood or circumstances of birth. It is\nsaid that, in the town which grew around this orphanage,\nthe children never failed to smile.
13382	Mercedes left home and went to Garreg Mach, where she\nbecame a model cleric. She devoted the whole of her life\nto the service of the goddess and became well-loved by the\npeople, who revered her for her piety and her boundless\ngenerosity toward those in need.
13383	Annette returned to her hometown of Fhirdiad where she\ntook up a teaching position at the Royal School of Sorcery.\nShe was a gifted instructor, and many of her students went\non to become world-renowned sages. Though her talent\nfor teaching was remarkable in its own right, she was\nperhaps best remembered for effortlessly securing the trust\nand respect of her many students, as well as inspiring all\nwho knew her by living a life of kindness, cheer,\nand humility.
13384	Ingrid declined to rule House Galatea, choosing instead\nto serve House Blaiddyd as a knight. After achieving\nwidespread renown, she formed an elite order of pegasus\nknights who served as personal bodyguards to the nobility.\nShe never took a husband.
13385	When Galatea territory was seized, Ingrid argued strongly\nfor the preservation of its borders. Her request was\ngranted, and she was appointed to rule. From her new\nposition, she gave her all to ensure that the people of\nGalatea lived peaceful lives and put in years of hard work\nto reform its farming practices. Her efforts bore fruit, to\nthe people's delight, and Galatea became a land of plenty.
13386	Soon after the war, Lorenz assumed leadership over House\nGloucester and helped govern F√≥dlan as a representative\nof the old Alliance lords. His political talent yielded\nrevolutionary policy changes, many of which were of\nparticular benefit to the commonfolk.
13387	Soon after the war, Lorenz assumed leadership over House\nGloucester and joined the realm of Imperial politics as a\nrepresentative of the old Alliance lords. His political talent\nyielded revolutionary policy changes, many of which were\nparticularly beneficial to the commonfolk.
13388	Raphael returned to his hometown to serve his liege lord\nas a knight. After years of loyal service, he resigned his\nduty to devote his attention to the inn that his grandfather\nand sister had opened during his time away. Eventually\nhe became the inn's proprietor and developed a reputation\nfor astonishingly good cooking.
13389	After returning home, Ignatz persuaded his family that he\nshould become a painter. He traveled all through F√≥dlan\nand beyond, painting beautiful landscapes and captivating\nportraits of the world's cultures. His unique style set the\nartistic paradigm for a generation.
13390	Lysithea returned home to help her parents restore their\nfamily land. Years later, when the end to their hard work\nwas finally in sight, she relinquished House Ordelia's claim\nto nobility, ceding the territory to a nearby lord. Shortly\nthereafter, she and her family disappeared into obscurity.
13391	Marianne returned home to a hero's welcome. The people\npraised her talent and acknowledged her as a savior of\nF√≥dlan. Her adoptive father groomed her as his successor,\nteaching her the power of words over weapons. By the\ntime she claimed her inheritance, she had transformed into\none of F√≥dlan's most skilled orators.
13392	After the war, Hilda set politics aside and focused on what\nshe enjoyed most: crafting fashionable accessories. Her\ndesigns quickly achieved widespread popularity. With the\nhelp of her brother, Hilda then created the first artisan\nacademy in F√≥dlan, where she served as both professor\nand headmaster.
13393	Leonie joined up with the mercenaries formerly led by\nJeralt. As his greatest apprentice, she quickly took on a\nleadership role and eventually even inherited the title of\nBlade Breaker. She came to be known as Jeralt the Second,\nas she began to resemble him in all things‚Äîincluding his\ndrinking habits. She left behind many unpaid tavern tabs.
13394	Seteth remained at the monastery and worked to restore\nthe authority of the Church of Seiros. Doing away with\nhis old strictness, he adopted a tolerant stance toward all.\nHis encouragement of believers to respect those of other\nfaiths helped the people of F√≥dlan to find common ground\nwith others.
13395	Flayn disappeared soon after the war, and over time\nit was all but forgotten that she had ever existed. Many\nlong years later, however, a young woman resurfaced in\na completely transformed F√≥dlan. When she looked to\nthe man who stood beside her, she wondered if it would\nbe all right, in this new era, to call him Father.
13396	Flayn disappeared soon after the war, and after a time,\nproof of her very existence faded from memory. Many\nyears later, a young woman appeared at the monastery,\nwhich had been restored to its former glory. Speaking to\nno one in particular, it is said that she gazed at the\nentrance and reverently whispered, "I am home."
13397	Though F√≥dlan had changed, Hanneman's goal remained\nunwavering: to determine the workings of the Crests and\nto do away with the inequality caused by them. To that\nend, his research resulted in magical tools that could be\nused even without the aid of Crests. This proved to be yet\nanother worthwhile discovery by the Father of Crestology.
13398	Manuela left Garreg Mach to build her own academy in\na small, war-torn town. There, she contributed heavily to\nrebuilding efforts while teaching future generations the\nnecessary skills of survival. Though she never married or\nhad children of her own, she spent the last years of her life\nhappily devoted to her students.
13399	Gilbert returned to Fhirdiad and resumed his duty as a\nknight, faithfully serving King Dimitri for many years.\nWhen he finally retired, it is said he spent the rest of his\ndays coaching the young prince in the art of combat.
13400	Once the long war against those who slither in the dark\ncame to an end, Alois and his family moved to Remire\nVillage and lived happily as farmers. It is said that from\nthe moment he put down his sword and picked up a hoe,\nhe never so much as thought about turning back.
13401	Once all the fighting had come to an end, Alois officially\ntook up the position of captain of the Knights of Seiros.\nIn this capacity, he was much beloved, and the Knights\nbecame more unified than ever under his command. It is\nsaid that their accomplishments during his tenure were\nbeyond even what Jeralt's troop had achieved.
13402	When Rhea resigned her position of archbishop and left\nthe Church of Seiros, Catherine followed. She devoted\nherself wholly to Rhea's protection, and the two lived a life\nof quiet seclusion. Though Thunderbrand remained\nalways by her side, she came to be known by a different\nname: the Guardian of Zanado.
13403	Catherine left the Knights of Seiros and set out to travel\nacross F√≥dlan. With Thunderbrand in hand, she wandered\nthe countryside, seeking always to defend the innocent and\npunish the wicked. Her many years of heroics ensured that\nshe would always be remembered by the people as a\nbeloved folk hero.
13404	Shortly after the war, Shamir gave up the mercenary life\nand disappeared. Though she was never heard from again,\nrumors swirled persistently for years of a master archer\nturned thief who lined her pockets by shaking down all\nthose who preyed upon the innocent.
13405	Unable to serve Rhea any longer, Cyril nearly left the\nchurch. He was persuaded to stay, however, to assist\nin rebuilding the monastery he had helped maintain.\nThanks to his devoted work ethic, the Officers Academy\nwas able to reopen a few years later. When the new\nstudents took the reception hall, Cyril found himself\namong them.
13406	S0 and Edelgard ended the tyranny of a\ngodlike being. S0 was wounded and lost\nthe power of the progenitor god, but it mattered not,\nas EK00heEL00sheEM00 and Edelgard had each other. To ensure lasting\npeace, the two fought against those who slither in the\ndark, and to ensure a society where people can rise and\nfall by their own merits, they spent their lives reforming\nthe antiquated class system. They achieved much in their\ntime together, and it is said that they were sometimes\nspotted leaving the palace to privately enjoy the world\nthey had created. How they spent those precious\nmoments, none but the two of them will ever know.
13407	Paired with the end of the war, the joyous marriage of\nS0, the newly-appointed archbishop,\nand Dimitri, the newly-crowned king of Faerghus,\ngave the people of F√≥dlan much to celebrate. The two\nwere devoted to improving life for the people and to\nseeking greater wisdom in order to reform the government\nand the church from the inside out. As leaders of church\nand state respectively, at times they engaged in heated\ndebate. Even still, when enjoying a long horse ride or a\nquiet evening, they were not as the world saw them,\nbut rather two adoring spouses, desperately in love.\nThey remained as such for the rest of their days.
13408	After ascending the throne as the first leader of the United\nKingdom of F√≥dlan, S0 sought to rebuild\nthe war-torn towns and villages and to help guide the\nreformation of the Church of Seiros. After a few months of\npeace, remnants of the Imperial army joined with those\nwho slither in the dark and marched upon the capital city\nof Derdriu. The new kingdom lacked the power to repel\nthe invaders, but when defeat seemed imminent, a battle\ncry rang out from the east. Claude, the newly-crowned\nKing of Almyra, led a mighty army that broke through the\nrebel forces with ease. This show of solidarity forever\naltered the course of history, heralding a new age of unity.
13409	After a fierce battle, S0 and Edelgard finally\nbrought the tyranny of a godlike being to an end. Though\nwounded in the conflict and stripped of divine power,\nS0 continued to fight alongside the\nemperor to bring true peace. Hubert joined them in this\nfight, fulfilling his promise to confront those who slither in\nthe dark head-on. In that darkness, S0 and\nHubert formed an unbreakable bond. It is said that, as a\nmarried couple, they were totally inseparable.
13410	After ascending to the throne as the first leader of the\nUnited Kingdom of F√≥dlan, S0 announced\nher marriage to Ferdinand, who had assumed his inherited\nposition as Duke Aegir. Ferdinand overcame a slew of\nobstacles to reform his territory and that of House Hrym.\nHe chose not to accept an official position in service to\nS0, instead advising her only informally as\na spouse. History books extol Ferdinand's success as a lord\nof his territories, but make no mention of his marriage.\nThus, half of his life's work is lost to time.
13411	After taking her place as the new archbishop of the\nChurch of Seiros, S0 announced her\nmarriage to Ferdinand, who had assumed his place as\nDuke Aegir. The archbishop's husband overcame a slew\nof obstacles to reform his family's territory and Hrym but\ntook no official position with the church, providing only\nguidance and support in his capacity as a loving spouse.\nHistory books extol Ferdinand's success as a lord of his\nterritories, but they make no mention of his marriage to\nthe archbishop. Thus, half of his life's work is lost to time.
13412	S0 and Ferdinand celebrated their marriage\nwith a lavish wedding, but almost immediately afterward,\nthe battle with those who slither in the dark began in\nearnest. After being named Duke Aegir, Ferdinand\novercame a slew of obstacles to help House Hrym and his\nfamily's territory recover. At the same time, he fought\nalongside his spouse for a true, lasting peace in F√≥dlan.\nHistory books extol Ferdinand's success as a lord of his\nterritories, but they do not make mention of the\nhard-fought battles he endured alongside his wife.\nThus, half of his life's work is lost to time.
13413	After ascending to the throne as the first leader of the\nUnited Kingdom of F√≥dlan, S0 announced\nEK00hisEL00herEM00 marriage to Linhardt. The people of F√≥dlan placed\nhigh expectations on their leader's spouse, but to their\nconsternation, Linhardt spent most of his time fishing,\nrelaxing, and researching Crests. Fortunes turned when\nS0 discovered a document, hidden away\non Linhardt's desk, which provided a ground-breaking\ndiscovery. Cast unwittingly into prominence, Linhardt\nwas put to work in earnest. In return for his service, he\ndemanded longer naps in the company of his spouse.
13414	After taking on the role of archbishop of the Church of\nSeiros, S0 announced EK00hisEL00herEM00 marriage to\nLinhardt. The people placed high expectations on him,\nbut to their consternation, Linhardt spent most of his time\nfishing, relaxing, and researching Crests. Fortunes turned\nwhen S0 discovered a document containing\na ground-breaking discovery hidden away on Linhardt's\ndesk. Cast unwittingly into prominence, Linhardt was put\nto work in earnest. In return for his service to the church,\nhe demanded longer naps with the archbishop.
13415	Though grateful for the end of the war, S0\nand Linhardt were disappointed to see that there was no\ntime to relax. The fight against those who slither in the\ndark began immediately, and Linhardt abandoned his\nterritory to help fight for a world of peace and quiet.\nThough the struggle was bitter, he took heart in the\nknowledge that once it was over, he and S0\ncould spend the rest of their days in leisure, chasing\nidle pursuits far away from the stage of battle.
13416	After ascending to the throne as the first leader of the\nUnited Kingdom of F√≥dlan, S0 announced\nEK00hisEL00herEM00 marriage to Caspar. But Caspar, never one to sit still\nfor long, set out on a journey of self-discovery. He traveled\nto every corner of F√≥dlan and even took S0\nalong on occasion.

13491	S0 declared the founding of the United\nKingdom of F√≥dlan at Garreg Mach and ascended the\nthrone as its first leader. Cyril served as a chamberlain,\nsupervising all general affairs. With the expansion of the\nkingdom, it was eventually decided that the queen would\nmove to a new royal capital.

13493	After finally saving both F√≥dlan and Rhea from crisis,\nS0 ascended the throne as the first leader of\nthe United Kingdom of F√≥dlan. From EK00hisEL00herEM00 temporary\nresidence at Garreg Mach Monastery, EK00heEL00sheEM00 endeavored to\nrestore and develop F√≥dlan. Having narrowly escaped\ndeath, Rhea took time to recover her strength before\nreturning to her role as archbishop. Upon her return,\nshe applied herself to rehabilitating the church and\nhelping those who had suffered because of the war.\nThereafter, the two worked closely to forge new policies\nand achieve progress for F√≥dlan. The pair's collective work\ncame to be thought of as nothing short of miraculous.
13494	As the new Adrestian emperor, Edelgard gave all she had\nto breathe new life into the government of F√≥dlan.\nWith tireless work, great sacrifice, and her devoted servant\nHubert by her side, she instituted new class reforms and\nhelped to ensure the people's independence. Hubert was\nalways close at hand, ready to dispose of unsavory burdens\nby any means necessary. In their later years, they passed\nthe fruits of her labor on to Edelgard's successor and\nvanished from the public eye. Though it is said they\nspent the rest of their lives together, it is unlikely they\never gave voice to the true depth of their affections.
13495	As the Adrestian emperor, Edelgard appointed Ferdinand\nas her prime minister, and the two devoted themselves to\nruling F√≥dlan. Their sharply contrasting views made for\nfrequent and lively debate, but with each enhancing the\nperspective of the other, F√≥dlan was better for it. As they\nworked tirelessly to create a better future, they were soon\nbound together by marriage as well. Their children,\nborn to those who had torn down the old social hierarchy,\nwere encouraged to choose their own paths.
13496	As the new Adrestian emperor, Edelgard gave all she had\nto breathe new life into the government of F√≥dlan.\nWith tireless work and great sacrifice, she instituted new\nclass reforms to ensure that people could rise on their own\nmerits. During those years, however, there was a period of\ntime in which she simply disappeared. It is said that she\nwent to the research facility of the foremost authority in\nCrests, Linhardt, who had relinquished his rank and title\nto live a life of study. There, after confirming the results\nof Linhardt's experiments, Edelgard was able to enjoy a\nrare break from her busy life. The respite was brief,\nbut they cherished that time for the rest of their lives.
13497	Edelgard, the new Adrestian emperor, appointed Caspar\nas her Minister of Military Affairs, and the two devoted\nthemselves to ruling F√≥dlan. Caspar quickly developed a\nreputation for recklessness in his duty, but he compensated\nfor it with successes in the field and was given leeway by\nthe emperor as a result. Privately, the couple's relationship\nas husband and wife was more tempestuous. Their spats\nwere frequent, but it is said that Edelgard took pleasure in\nher ability to influence Caspar, and Caspar enjoyed\nreining the emperor in from time to time. It was a strange\nbut happy union.
13498	When Bernadetta inherited House Varley from her father,\nshe tried to withdraw from politics and remain within the\nbounds of her territory, but Edelgard, the new Adrestian\nemperor, would not allow it. Instead, she demanded that\nBernadetta counsel her in governing F√≥dlan. It is said that\nthe emperor made this choice to keep herself from being\ntoo detached, and that Bernadetta was all too happy to\nprovide a more emotional perspective now and again.\nThe people of Enbarr could always tell when the two were\nmeeting by the sound of Bernadetta's panicked voice\nringing out from the palace.
13499	As Edelgard's reign as the Adrestian emperor began,\nEnbarr was restored, and with it, a certain opera house.\nSoon the Mittelfrank Opera Company put together a war\ndrama depicting the journey and sacrifice of the emperor\nand her companions, and the starring role went to none\nother than Dorothea. Edelgard initially forbade the\ncompany from staging it, but was eventually persuaded by\nDorothea's passionate performance to rescind that decree.\nIt is said that the emperor always set aside time to enjoy\nthe opera thereafter.
13500	As the new Adrestian emperor, Edelgard gave all she had\nto breathe new life into the government of F√≥dlan. To that\nend, Hanneman's research proved invaluable. Seeking to\ndetermine the nature of Crests, and to do away with the\ninequality caused by them, the Father of Crestology\nproduced magical tools that could be used even without\nthe aid of Crests. These were put to eager use by Edelgard,\nwho saw both of their dreams realized. It is not hard to\nimagine that a pair with such similar ideologies and plans\nfor the future would eventually settle into an affectionate\nand fulfilling relationship.
13501	As the new Adrestian emperor, Edelgard gave all she had\nto breathe new life into the government of F√≥dlan.\nHer first objective was to institute new class reforms and\nensure the people's independence. For that reason,\nshe sought the counsel of Manuela, whose vast array of\ncontacts, talents, and experience proved invaluable.\nShe became essential to Edelgard, and her skill as a\nphysician kept the emperor in good health for many years.\nBoth remained unmarried, and it is said that the two\nbecame extremely close over the years.
13502	After the war, Edelgard and Lysithea threw themselves\ninto the fight against those who slither in the dark.\nThe struggle was long and arduous, but not without its\nbenefits. With careful analysis of ancient techniques,\nthey discovered ways to recover the years of life that had\nbeen stolen from them. Afterwards, the new Adrestian\nemperor and Lysithea, her trusted officer, devoted the\nrest of their lives to F√≥dlan's rule. For her counsel in\ninstituting class reforms and ensuring the independence of\nthe people, Lysithea came to be known as the Wisdom of\nthe Empire. The pair of talented women ushered F√≥dlan\ninto a new age of innovation and prosperity.
13503	After his coronation, Dimitri assumed the throne of the\nHoly Kingdom of Faerghus, and his loyal vassal, Dedue,\nremained ever at his side. Among Dimitri's achievements\nwas the reconciliation with Duscur: an extraordinary effort\nthat required extensive negotiations to get past a history of\nbetrayal and oppression. It was a trying task, but Dimitri\nnever once considered giving up. While they behaved as\nlord and vassal in public, it is said that Dimitri and Dedue\nwere more like family in private. When Dimitri finally fell\nto illness, Dedue tended to his liege's deathbed, and then\ntook up a post at his grave for the rest of his days.\nWhen the time came, they were buried beside each other.
13504	After his coronation, Dimitri assumed the throne of the\nHoly Kingdom of Faerghus and spent his life ruling justly\nover F√≥dlan. At his side every step of the way was his\nright-hand adviser, Duke Felix Fraldarius. Their lifelong\nbond grew so strong over time that, when Dimitri finally\npassed, it is said that Felix's grief was more potent even\nthan the queen's. The stories of their lives were passed\ndown to future generations as chivalric tales that rivaled\nthose of Loog, the King of Lions, and his sworn friend,\nKyphon.
13505	After his coronation, Dimitri assumed the throne of the\nHoly Kingdom of Faerghus and took his friend, Mercedes,\nas his queen. Most were shocked by his choice, as she did\nnot come from a distinguished noble line. Still, when the\npeople saw her devotion to healing the damage caused by\nthe war, they decided she was the ideal match for the one\nthey called the Savior King. It is said that the couple led\nbusy but happy lives, and that they never failed to express\ntheir appreciation for one another, no matter the hardship.
13506	After his coronation, Dimitri assumed the throne of the\nHoly Kingdom of Faerghus and spent his life ruling justly\nover F√≥dlan. At his side every step of the way was his\nqueen, Annette, whose wisdom provided not only reliable\ncounsel, but a whole assortment of revolutionary policies.\nThe royal couple's sincere approach to governance earned\nthem widespread acclaim, securing their line as a dynasty\nthat lasted for generations to come. Their married life was\nsaid to be full of love and cheer.
13507	After his coronation, Dimitri assumed the throne of the\nHoly Kingdom of Faerghus and spent his life ruling justly\nover F√≥dlan. At his side every step of the way was Ingrid,\nwho left House Galatea to serve House Blaiddyd as a\nknight. As they worked together to restore the Kingdom,\nthe pair fell in love and were eventually married. But while\nIngrid was happy to play the role of queen, and to support\nher husband in public and in private, she insisted on\ntaking up a weapon and serving on the front lines in battle.
13508	Dimitri assumed the throne of the Holy Kingdom of\nFaerghus and spent his life ruling justly over F√≥dlan.\nSeveral years after his coronation, he took Marianne,\nwhom he loved dearly, as his queen. Many of Dimitri's\ngreatest achievements can be traced to wisdom provided\nby Marianne, who had received tutelage from her adoptive\nfather, Margrave Edmund. Many years later, when Dimitri\nfell to illness, he clutched his queen's hand until the very\nend. The queen's journal, uncovered after her passing,\ncontained recounts of their time together. The last words,\npenned with trembling hand, are: "I would not trade our\ntime together or the happiness we knew for anything."
13509	Dimitri assumed the throne of the Holy Kingdom of\nFaerghus and spent his life ruling justly over F√≥dlan.\nSome time after his coronation, he took Flayn, who now\nenjoyed a position of prominence in the church, as his\nqueen. Many speculated at first that the marriage was\npolitically motivated, but it is said that over time the love\nthey had for one another became clear to see. Their lives\nwere full of warmth and tranquility. Many years later,\nwhen Dimitri passed, his journals revealed that he had\nkept a meticulous record of all the meals he and his wife\nhad enjoyed together.
13510	Dimitri assumed the throne of the Holy Kingdom of\nFaerghus and spent his life ruling justly over F√≥dlan.\nAt his side was the knight, Gustave, who had discarded\nthe name of Gilbert and reaffirmed his oath of fealty to\nthe royal family. After many more years of service,\nin which the trust between them grew and never wavered,\nGustave finally wished to retire. Though he bristled\nslightly at Dimitri's request to look after and tutor the\nyoung prince, it is said that Gustave took on that duty\nwith due patience and solemnity for the remainder of\nhis life.
13511	Dimitri assumed the throne of the Holy Kingdom of\nFaerghus and spent his life ruling justly over F√≥dlan.\nTwo years after his coronation, he announced his marriage\nto Catherine. The people speculated wildly about how this\nunion came to be. Some said that Dimitri spent two full\nyears wooing her, while others suggested that the matter\nwas resolved by a duel. In any case, the couple worked\ntirelessly to reform the Kingdom, but despite their busy\ndays, it is said that they always found time for sparring,\nand that the clash of steel could be heard throughout the\ncastle at all hours.
13512	Entrusting the future of F√≥dlan to his friends, Claude left\nfor Almyra with Annette, whom he intended to marry.\nHe announced this fact to his father, the king of Almyra,\nwho approved of Claude's growth and Annette's wisdom\nand resolved to entrust the monarchy to them. Once he\nbecame king, Claude established a school of sorcery\nwith the intent to use it as a bridge between Almyra and\nF√≥dlan. Annette took on a role as headmaster, supporting\nClaude's dream by opening the doors to students from\nevery corner of the world. Relations between Almyra and\nF√≥dlan improved drastically as a result.
13513	Entrusting the future of F√≥dlan to his friends, Claude left\nfor Almyra with Ingrid, whom he intended to marry.\nHe announced this fact to his father, the king of Almyra,\nwho approved of Claude's strength and Ingrid's virtue and\nresolved to entrust the monarchy to them. Even after\nthey ascended the throne, Claude and Ingrid argued\nfrequently. But while the queen chasing the fleeing king\nthrough the palace was a common occurrence, the couple\nmust have loved one another deeply, for they happily\nraised many children together.
13514	Claude left F√≥dlan, entrusting its future to his friends.\nHe intended to travel to his homeland of Almyra, but his\nlove for Petra instead drew him west, to Brigid. He won\nher affection, and after receiving the blessing of her\ngrandfather, the king of Brigid, the two were wed.\nSome years later, each inherited their respective thrones.\nAs the monarchs of Brigid and Almyra, Petra and Claude\nfostered friendly diplomatic relations between the two\nregions and F√≥dlan.
13515	Claude disappeared from F√≥dlan after the war, leaving the\nnew head of House Gloucester, Lorenz, to support the\nnew United Kingdom of F√≥dlan in his stead. He proposed\nrevolutionary policies to restore the war-torn region at a\nrapid rate. When the rebuilding effort was complete,\nLorenz turned his eye toward diplomacy, seeking to\nestablish treaties of friendship with foreign nations.\nAlmyra was no exception, and when the two parties met\nfor a summit at F√≥dlan's Locket, it was none other than\nClaude, the new king of Almyra, who arrived to negotiate.\nSome speculated that this meeting had been Claude's\nscheme all along, but Lorenz and Claude both denied it.
13516	Entrusting the future of F√≥dlan to his friends, Claude left\nfor Almyra to reclaim his place as heir to the throne.\nWhen he became king, he asked Lysithea to be his queen\nwith a heart full of love, and with the hope of fostering\nfriendly diplomatic relations with F√≥dlan. Due to her\nshortened lifespan, Lysithea declined. Claude, unable to\nabandon his love for her, gave up the throne to go on a\nquest for a means to save her. Years later, he appeared\nsuddenly before her, claiming to have found a cure.\nWith her trust and love to guide him, he whisked her\naway, across the sea. It is unknown where they went.
13517	Entrusting the future of F√≥dlan to his friends, Claude left\nfor Almyra to reclaim his place as heir to the throne.\nSeveral years later, when he became king, he took initial\nsteps to open trade routes with F√≥dlan, and entered into\nnegotiations with Margrave Edmund. During this time,\nhe was reunited with Marianne, who had grown under her\nadoptive father's guidance into a wise and talented woman.\nShe offered him her aid, and as they worked together to\nsecure friendly relations between their respective nations,\nthey fell deeply in love.
13518	Entrusting the future of F√≥dlan to his friends, Claude left\nfor Almyra to take his place as heir to the throne.\nHis family saw that he had grown strong and allowed\nhim to claim his birthright. When he became king several\nyears later, he made the surprise announcement that he\nwould make Hilda his queen. Having studied with her\nbrother to prepare for this moment, Hilda demonstrated\nan uncanny talent for diplomacy, and greatly contributed\nto establishing friendly relations between F√≥dlan and\nAlmyra. The presence of a F√≥dlan-born queen for two\nconsecutive generations did much to alter Almyran values.
13519	Leonie returned to Sauin Village to repay her debts and\nmysteriously vanished afterwards. Some years later,\nwhen trade between F√≥dlan and Almyra began in earnest,\nthe village received notice that the Almyran king would be\npassing through on his way to Garreg Mach. The village\nrushed to prepare themselves. When the anticipated day\narrived, they were shocked to find Leonie at the king's\nside. She had gone to visit Claude in Almyra, and had\nended up staying to become his queen. Faced with the\nsight of Leonie in the resplendent clothing of a monarch,\nher father and the other villagers could do nothing but\nstand in mute amazement.
13520	Entrusting the future of F√≥dlan to his friends, Claude left\nfor Almyra to reclaim his place as heir to the throne.\nSeveral years later, when he became king, he took initial\nsteps to open diplomatic relations with F√≥dlan, and asked\nGarreg Mach for aid. During this time, he was reunited\nwith Flayn, who had been helping Seteth run the church.\nShe agreed to help, and as they worked together to secure\nfriendly relations between their respective regions,\nthey fell deeply in love. It is said that Seteth never learned\nof their relationship.
13521	After the war, Claude returned home to Almyra and took\nhis place in the royal family. Some years later he became\nking, and during his reign, promoted policies to improve\nrelations with F√≥dlan and protect children who had been\norphaned by the war. After he achieved his goals, he left\nthe throne to a family member and left Almyra. During his\ntravels, he encountered Shamir, who had been wandering\nthe world as a mercenary. It is known that they traveled\ntogether from that day forward, but where they journeyed\nto remains a mystery.
13522	Hubert and Ferdinand became the left and right hands of\nEmperor Edelgard, competing constantly with each other\nto see who could be the more helpful. They were\nopposites‚Äîthe Minister of the Imperial Household,\nmelancholy and merciless, and the prime minister, bright\nand compassionate. Still, they brought out the best in each\nother. As the Empire became orderly and prosperous, the\ntwo came to be known as the nation's "Two Jewels," and\nwere remembered fondly for generations to come. Some\nsay their fame made even Emperor Edelgard jealous.
13523	The marriage between Hubert, Minister of the Imperial\nHousehold, and Bernadetta, leader of House Varley,\nwas so surprising to the public that it was much talked\nabout even outside of political circles in the capital.\nBernadetta took the opportunity to survey the far reaches\nof the new Adrestian Empire, and in her absence,\nHubert took well to the management of Varley territory.\nThey proved to be an astonishingly good match,\nworking together to protect F√≥dlan from the shadows.\nIt is said that they showed their affection for one another\nby wearing matching embroidered flowers.\n
13524	After the war, the Mittelfrank Opera Company made a\nresurgence, in no small part thanks to the patronage of\nEmperor Edelgard's confidant, Hubert. Dorothea made a\ncomeback as a songstress within the troupe, which traveled\nall over F√≥dlan, putting a large share of its profits toward\nrelief efforts. The opera company was warmly welcomed\nby the war-weary people as a source of solace, and became\neven more famous than before. It was not discovered until\nmany years later that the troupe's tour had been a covert\noperation, coordinated by Hubert and Dorothea to gather\nintelligence for the Empire.
13525	Shortly after the war, Brigid renegotiated its diplomatic\narrangement with the Adrestian Empire, ending its service\nas a vassal and becoming a full ally. As part of that\nagreement, Petra, queen of Brigid, was wed to Hubert,\nMarquis Vestra. Some say that the marriage was purely\npolitical, ordered by Emperor Edelgard, while others insist\nthat it was of their own accord. Although they led busy\nlives, and sometimes lived separately. Still, their shared\nhome in the western F√≥dlan village of Nuvelle was filled\nwith their many children, suggesting a loving union.
13526	As confidant to Edelgard, Hubert disposed of every burden\nfacing his emperor by any means necessary, and excelled\nat working in the shadows. Supporting him from the front\nlines was the former mercenary, Shamir, who commanded\nthe emperor's elite troops. When the two married, they\nappeared from the outside to be little more than a lord of\nthe Empire and his dutiful wife. In reality, their nights\nwere filled with fierce combat against rebels, assassins, and\nthose who slither in the dark. It is reported that one of\nthem was known to often state that, "To find love between\nlife and death is a gift." It is unknown which of the two\nactually spoke these words.
13527	After the war, Mercedes traveled to Fhirdiad to pay a visit\nto her adoptive father. Though she introduced Ferdinand,\nshe left out the small detail that they were engaged to be\nwed. Married in secret, Ferdinand and Mercedes worked\ntogether to reform the new Duke Aegir's territory, and\nthe effort was so successful that Emperor Edelgard named\nFerdinand her prime minister. It was a busy life for him\nindeed, but as he was known to say to his government\ncolleagues, coming home to a smiling family made all the\nhard work worth it.

Married in secret, Ferdinand and Mercedes worked\ntogether to reform the new Duke Aegir's territory, and\nthe effort was so successful that he was called upon to\nwork as a leader in the central government. It was a busy\nlife for him indeed, but as he was known to say to his\ngovernment colleagues, coming home to a smiling family\nmade all the hard work worth it.
13529	After the war, Bernadetta renounced her claim to House\nVarley. She married Ferdinand, the new Duke Aegir, and\nthe two contributed to relief efforts by instituting reforms\nacross their Dukedom. Due to the success of those\npolicies, Ferdinand was offered the position of prime\nminister by the emperor. He accepted, leaving the\nmanagement of Aegir territory to his wife, while he\nworked to apply their ideas to the Empire at large. Since\nBernadetta did not like to leave home, Ferdinand's life\ninvolved a lot of travel to and from the capital, but it is\nsaid he always embarked on his return home with a smile\non his face.
13530	After the war, Bernadetta renounced her claim to House\nVarley. She married Ferdinand, the new Duke Aegir, and\nthe two contributed to relief efforts by instituting reforms\nacross their Dukedom. Due to the success of those\npolicies, Ferdinand was offered the opportunity to help\ngovern all F√≥dlan. He accepted, leaving the management\nof Aegir territory to his wife, while he worked to apply\ntheir ideas to the world at large. Since Bernadetta did not\nlike to leave home, Ferdinand's life involved a lot of travel,\nbut it is said he always embarked on his return home with\na smile.
13531	After officially becoming the new Duke Aegir, Ferdinand\nset about reforming his territory. Thanks to the wisdom of\nhis wife, Dorothea, Ferdinand's policies were of massive\nbenefit to the commonfolk and brought about a swift\nrecovery. In recognition of this achievement, he was called\nupon by Emperor Edelgard to introduce these reforms to\nthe Empire at large as the new prime minister. Though the\nwork kept him very busy, he always managed to find time\nfor Dorothea. It is said that their children filled their\nloving household with beautiful music ever after.

Thanks to the wisdom of\nhis wife, Dorothea, Ferdinand's policies were of massive\nbenefit to the commonfolk and brought about a swift\nrecovery. In recognition of this achievement, he was called\nupon to help govern to F√≥dlan at large. Though the work\nof reforming the entire nation kept him very busy, he\nalways managed to find time for Dorothea. It is said that\ntheir children filled their loving household with beautiful\nmusic ever after.
13533	After officially becoming Duke Aegir, Ferdinand asked\nEmperor Edelgard if she would make him her minister of\nforeign affairs rather than her prime minister. She granted\nhis wish, and his first task in his new position was to\nnegotiate with Petra, who had inherited the throne of\nBrigid and declared her Kingdom's freedom from Imperial\nvassalage. Ferdinand and Petra collaborated to deepen the\nfriendship between their nations and forge a strong,\nenduring alliance. As a symbol of the nations' friendship,\nFerdinand and Petra took up residence together in\nNuvelle, on the western fringe of F√≥dlan. It is said that\nthey negotiated for years to achieve this compromise.
13534	After officially becoming Duke Aegir, Ferdinand worked\nto restore the territory, and as part of that effort, sought to\ndevelop an improved relationship with Brigid. He reached\nout to Petra, who had inherited the throne of Brigid, and\nshe agreed to send resources for the relief effort. At the\nsame time, the two continued their private relationship\nacross borders, and when Aegir territory had recovered,\nthey married. Ferdinand relocated to Brigid with his\nqueen, and the pair worked tirelessly to improve\ndiplomatic relations. Their work involved much travel,\nbut they made sure to find time once in a while to stop\nand enjoy their happiness.
13535	Ferdinand announced his engagement to Marianne just\nafter becoming the new Duke Aegir. While he got started\nrestoring his territory, Marianne returned home to study\npolitics under her shrewd adoptive father. When she\nreturned to Ferdinand's side, they were wed, and with\nher new skills she proved herself to be an asset to the\nrebuilding effort. Aegir territory flourished under their\nreign, becoming one of the most prosperous regions in all\nF√≥dlan. It is said that Ferdinand commissioned a bronze\nstatue of his wife to honor her, but that Marianne ordered\nit to be hidden away in storage for eternity.
13536	Ferdinand announced his marriage to Marianne just\nafter becoming the new Duke Aegir. With the support of\nMargrave Edmund, they set to work restoring Aegir\nterritory. The support of Marianne's adoptive father was\nessential, but not sufficient, for the relief effort. As more\ndifficulties arose, Marianne herself took on an increasing\namount of responsibility. She proved quite capable and\ndedicated, and the Dukedom progressed through a steady\nrecovery under the couple's collective efforts. It is said that\nFerdinand commissioned a bronze statue of his wife to\nhonor her achievements, but Marianne ordered it to be\nhidden away in storage for eternity.
13537	After becoming the new Duke Aegir, Ferdinand married\nHilda, the daughter of Duke Goneril. The marriage was\nwarmly received by the people, with high expectations\nplaced on them as they set about restoring the territory.\nHilda rarely took part in politics herself, but she still\ncontributed greatly by recommending exceptional people\nto influential positions. Her hobby of creating fashionable\naccessories also bore fruit, as her designs achieved\nwidespread popularity, and she created the first artisan\nacademy in F√≥dlan. The school produced many talented\ncraftsmen, including Ferdinand himself, who was said to\ncraft handmade trinkets for his wife.
13538	Ferdinand married Flayn just after becoming the new\nDuke Aegir, and the pair wasted no time getting to work\non the rebuilding effort. While Ferdinand handled\nadministrative matters, Flayn walked more directly among\nthe people, seeing to their needs. Their teamwork and\ncomplementary skills led to rapid recovery and growth for\nthe region, but it is said that what inspired the people most\nof all was the genuine intimacy and affection between the\nruling couple.
13539	Almost immediately after becoming the new Duke Aegir,\nFerdinand married Manuela, and the two dedicated\nthemselves to reformation efforts. Manuela lent her\nconsiderable talent and experience, using personal\nconnections she'd gained in her time as a songstress and\nteacher to assemble a team of talented people. Between her\npersonal skills and her ability as a physician, she became\nso essential that the emperor saw fit to make her the new\nprime minister. As she spent more time in the capital,\nbringing the reforms that helped Aegir territory to the\nEmpire at large, Ferdinand stayed behind, minding his\nown lands and looking after their child.

Manuela lent her\nconsiderable talent and experience, using personal\nconnections she'd gained in her time as a songstress and\nteacher to assemble a team of talented people. Between\nher personal skills and her ability as a physician, she\nbecame so essential that she was called upon to help bring\nthe reforms that helped Aegir territory to F√≥dlan at large.\nWhile she traveled the world, Ferdinand stayed behind,\nminding his own lands and looking after their child.
13541	When the Officers Academy reopened after the war,\nLinhardt gave up his inheritance to take on a position as a\nprofessor there. He soon married Annette, who had taken\non the same job, and side by side, they helped to educate\nthe next generation of students. Unfortunately, Annette\ntook her teaching duties far more seriously than Linhardt,\nwho was more concerned with his Crest research, and\ndeveloped a reputation for falling asleep‚Äîsometimes more\nthan once‚Äîduring his own lectures. In their first few years\nas a couple she fought desperately to correct his behavior,\nbut later she learned to accept it, and even looked forward\nto finding creative ways to wake him up.
13542	After the war, Linhardt and Caspar abandoned their\nnoble houses to pursue a carefree journey wandering the\nworld. They traveled to every corner of F√≥dlan, and even\nventured abroad now and again. Caspar got into trouble at\nevery turn on their travels, but Linhardt was always there,\nbegrudgingly, to get him out of it. The records of their\nadventures were immortalized in a book by an anonymous\nauthor, entitled "The Thousand Roads and Seven Seas."\nIt is said they did eventually settle down, after the events\nin those stories, but where they actually went is unknown.
13543	Linhardt and Bernadetta caused quite the stir after the\nwar when they abandoned their inherited titles and\neloped to Garreg Mach. Returning to the monastery,\nwhere they were always most comfortable, the couple lived\npeaceful lives away from the hassle of politics. When the\nEmpire's efforts to restore the church were complete, the\nOfficers Academy reopened, and two eccentric individuals\ntook up professorships there. One was perpetually asleep,\nor absorbed in absentminded study; the other refused to\nshow herself at all unless it was time to give a lecture.
13544	Linhardt and Bernadetta caused quite the stir after the\nwar when they abandoned their inherited titles and\neloped to Garreg Mach. Returning to the monastery,\nwhere they were always most comfortable, the couple lived\npeaceful lives away from the hassle of politics. When the\nchurch was fully restored, the Officers Academy reopened,\nand two eccentric individuals took up professorships there.\nOne was perpetually asleep, or absorbed in absentminded\nstudy; the other refused to show herself at all unless it was\ntime to give a lecture.
13545	After the war, Linhardt decided to inherit his title. He\nspent several years studying his territory, learning to\nmanage its affairs, and when he was finally ready to\nbecome the new Count Hevring, he announced his\nmarriage to Dorothea. Somehow, despite all this activity,\nLinhardt actually managed to keep up with his Crest\nstudies. Though his results were dubious at times, his new\nwife helped him alter them so that they would be of use to\npeople. Their relationship was unlike anything the\nnobility had ever witnessed. When faced with this\naccusation, Linhardt and Dorothea could only laugh and\nnote that the past was of no significance to them.
13546	Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid, and inherited\nthe throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared\nindependence from F√≥dlan, and renegotiated Brigid's\ndiplomatic relationships on more equal terms. Next, she\nintroduced industrial practices that were modeled on those\nof F√≥dlan, vastly improving her homeland's economy. This\nrapid development surprised those abroad, until it was\ndiscovered that the improvements came thanks to the\ncounsel of Petra's husband, Linhardt, who had left F√≥dlan\nto offer Brigid his talent and insight. It is said that the\ncouple maintained a healthy and affectionate relationship,\nand that they raised many happy children together.
13547	Though Linhardt researched vigorously for a method by\nwhich to remove the Crests from Lysithea and save her\nlife, the war ended before he could reach any conclusions.\nLysithea, deciding that she should return home to her\nparents, thanked Linhardt and took her leave of Garreg\nMach. Not to be deterred, Linhardt set his affairs in order,\nrenounced his noble title, and followed Lysithea to\nOrdelia territory to continue his research. Years later, his\nefforts bore fruit, and Lysithea's Crests were successfully\nremoved. With a new future ahead of her, Lysithea, too,\nrenounced her noble claim, and the couple married as\ncommoners. It is said they raised a very happy family.
13548	Marianne returned home to a warm welcome from her\nadoptive father, who recognized her wisdom and skill and\nbegan to groom her as his successor. Meanwhile, Linhardt\nabandoned his noble claim, and happened to choose\nMargrave Edmund's territory as the site at which to\ncontinue his Crest research. Edmund took a liking to\nLinhardt and approved wholeheartedly when the scholar\nand his daughter expressed their wish to marry. As\nEdmund's successors, the couple combined Linhardt's\nbrilliance with Marianne's practical wisdom to bring\nabundance to the people.
13549	Immediately after the war, Flayn disappeared from Garreg\nMach. At the same time, Linhardt mysteriously abandoned\nhis claim to House Hevring, and also vanished. It was\nsuspected, among those who knew them, that they had\neloped, although no one seemed to know just where they\nwent. Over a decade later, well after the Officers Academy\nhad been rebuilt, something strange happened. A sleepy\nyoung girl with antiquated clothing and the Major Crest\nof Cethleann enrolled. Over the next two years, a young\nboy and girl with that same Crest also enrolled. Though\nCrest scholars deduced that they must be siblings,\nthe truth of their lineage was never definitely proven.
13550	When Rhea absconded her post as archbishop, Catherine\nresigned from the Knights of Seiros and accompanied her\nto a life of seclusion in the Red Canyon. They were joined\nby Catherine's new husband, Linhardt, who continued his\nCrest research at Catherine's behest. Motivated by his\nwife, and freed from all other distractions, Linhardt made\nnew discoveries at an astonishing rate. The fruits of his\nresearch brought about dramatic changes in the world of\nCrest research, but for the sake of his privacy, Linhardt\nalways published his papers anonymously.
13551	Catherine left the Knights of Seiros and set out to travel\nacross F√≥dlan. With Thunderbrand in hand, she wandered\nthe countryside, seeking always to defend the innocent and\npunish the wicked. During these years of heroics, she had\nan unusual traveling companion in Linhardt, who had\nrenounced his noble title and followed her. During their\nadventures, Catherine was said to be nearly unstoppable,\nand Linhardt all but useless‚Äîexcept in moments of great\nneed, when the Crest scholar's wisdom would suddenly\ncarry the day. The pair's adventures lived on as beloved\nfolktales, passed down through the generations. It is\nunclear whether the two were ever romantically involved.
13552	After the war, Caspar and Ashe embarked on a carefree\njourney around the world. They traveled to every corner\nof F√≥dlan, and even ventured abroad now and again, with\nthe sole purpose of punishing those who preyed upon the\nhelpless. Though Caspar seemed to get into trouble at\nevery turn, Ashe was always there to get him out of it, and\nCaspar's bravery and strength returned the favor more\nthan once. Though opposites in many ways, they shared\nthe same view of justice, and their abilities complemented\none another nicely. The stories of their adventures lived on\nas exciting and amusing folktales.
13553	In recognition of his achievements during the war, Caspar\nwas given the title of Minister of Military Affairs in the\nnew Adrestian Empire. Though he was well-known for his\nvalor in battle, it was his wife, Annette, who reined in his\nrecklessness and who truly kept the army in order. The\ntroops came to see Annette as a motherly figure, and under\nher guidance, the Imperial army thrived. In their private\nlife as a couple, the roles were totally reversed, as Caspar\nhad to be the one to step in and correct Annette's various\ncalamities around the house.
13554	Annette returned to her hometown of Fhirdiad, where she\ntook up a teaching position at the school of sorcery and\nmentored many great sages. Unfortunately, she remained\nprone to accidents, and one such event nearly took her life.\nSeparated from her students in the mountains, she became\ntotally lost‚Äîbut just when it seemed she would never be\nfound, she was rescued by none other than Caspar, who\nhappened to be passing through on his travels around the\nworld. After this lucky reunion, he escorted her to\nFhirdiad, and during his time there, the two fell in love.\nThe couple's fateful tale inspired a generation of young,\nstarry-eyed students.
13555	After some uncertainty about the details, it was decided\nthat Caspar would marry into Bernadetta's family, seeing\nas she had claim to House Varley. The two had a chaotic\nreign, and a marriage to match. Each time Caspar caused\nsome incident, Bernadetta would demand promises as\nrecompense. Over time, these oaths accumulated to such a\ngreat number that it became necessary to compile them,\nand the resulting document came to be known as the "47\nArticles of Bernie." Among these Articles was the provision\nthat, when counting their large quantity of children,\nCaspar was not to accidentally count his wife among them.
13556	In recognition of his achievements during the war, Caspar\nwas given the title of Minister of Military Affairs in the\nnew Adrestian Empire. Though his command developed a\nreputation for occasional recklessness, he proved an able\nleader, guiding his troops to overcome countless obstacles.\nIn his personal life, he began to spend a great deal of time\nwith Dorothea, who had returned to the Mittelfrank\nOpera Company after the war. When her efforts brought\nthe opera house to the peak of its resurgence, it is said that\nDorothea relinquished her position as songstress in order\nto retire with Caspar. They are rumored to have spent the\nrest of their lives together.
13557	After the war, Caspar set out alone on a journey of\nself-discovery. He traveled to every corner of F√≥dlan, and\neven ventured abroad now and again. Though his antics\nfound him no end of exciting adventures, he was always\ndrawn back to Dorothea, who had returned to the\nMittelfrank Opera Company in Enbarr after the war. The\ntwo spent more and more time together over the years,\nand when Dorothea's efforts brought the opera house to\nthe peak of its resurgence, she relinquished her position as\nsongstress and disappeared from the stage. It is rumored\nthat the pair spent the rest of their lives together.
13558	Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid, and inherited\nthe throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared\nindependence from F√≥dlan, and renegotiated Brigid's\ndiplomatic ties to F√≥dlan and Dagda on more equal terms.\nAt every step along the way, she was accompanied and\nsupported by her husband, Caspar, who had left F√≥dlan\nbehind to be with her. It is said that the people of Brigid\nwere initially suspicious of the union, due to Caspar's\nrelation to a nemesis of their homeland, but that his\ntireless efforts on Brigid's behalf endeared them to him\nover time. It certainly helped that he made the queen\nvery happy.
13559	Caspar and Hilda, under no pressure to inherit any noble\ntitles, spent the early years of peace after the war traveling.\nThey journeyed to every corner of F√≥dlan, and even\nventured abroad now and again. Caspar's antics caused\nendless entertainment for Hilda, who loved to stand by\nand watch him fight or squirm his way out of trouble.\nEventually, their free-spirited adventure was called to an\nend by Hilda's brother, Holst, who offered Caspar a\nposition as a knight in service of House Goneril. Caspar\naccepted, and before long, he and Hilda were married.\nThe couple raised many children, and were said to have a\nnotoriously lively household.
13560	When Rhea absconded her post as archbishop, Catherine\nresigned from the Knights of Seiros and followed in order\nto protect her. They were joined by Catherine's new\nhusband, Caspar, who had the same goal, and together\nthey retired to a life of seclusion in the Red Canyon.\nCaspar and Catherine spent the bulk of their days farming\nand hunting, but since neither was content to go a day\nwithout wielding a weapon, they sparred routinely.\nThe sound of their swords ringing out, in time with\nCaspar's heated cries, was heard daily across the valley.
13561	Catherine resigned from the Knights of Seiros and traveled\nacross F√≥dlan with Caspar. They dedicated themselves to\ndefending the helpless wherever they went, and in time,\nthe names Thunder Catherine and Inferno Caspar were\nknown to all the world. Legends of their adventures\nbecame so popular and well-known that even catchphrases\nsuch as "Face the wrath of Thunderbrand!" and "Hey,\nthat's not your sword!" were recounted in the stories that\nwere passed down for generations.
13562	After the war, Caspar and Shamir used their clout as\nheroes to establish a mercenary company. They branded\nthemselves as crusaders for justice, punishing those who\npreyed on the weak or exploited others for their own gain.\nNone could compete against their combined martial skill,\nand they became famous all throughout F√≥dlan. Their\ntravels took them to every part of the world, and while\nCaspar's antics occasionally got him into trouble, Shamir's\nsteady presence and firm demeanor helped to resolve\nmatters amicably. Their stories endured as amusing\nanecdotes, passed down through generations.
13563	After the war, Felix inherited the title of Duke Fraldarius\nfrom his late father, Rodrigue. He married Bernadetta,\nwho abandoned claim to House Varley in order to start a\nlife with him. After they had finished restoring Fraldarius\nterritory, Felix traveled across F√≥dlan as the king's right\nhand. While he was away, Bernadetta handled local affairs\nwhile holed up in her room in the castle. The frigid air of\nnorthern Faerghus caused her to hide away even more\nthan usual, but whenever her beloved husband returned,\nshe would rush out to greet him.
13564	After the war, Felix attempted to set out on his own, but\nwas waylaid by Bernadetta, who begged him not to go.\nPersuaded to stay, Felix ended up marrying into House\nVarley, the title of which Bernadetta had inherited. The\ncouple got along smoothly, although it was rumored that\nin the early years of their marriage, she once had to\nrestrain him physically to prevent him taking a trip to the\nOghma Mountains to train. As the years wore on,\nBernadetta became more reclusive, and Felix took over\nmany of the day-to-day duties of running the house.\nDocuments from their later years were increasingly signed\nwith the name Felix, Count Varley.
13565	When Bernadetta first inherited control of House Varley,\nshe hid away and would not dare involve herself in\npolitical or administrative affairs. During this time it\nwas Raphael who came to her aid, encouraging her to\nwork through her fear of people. The training period was\ndifficult‚Äî"humiliating," according to the journals\nBernadetta left behind‚Äîbut in the end, it had its desired\neffect. The leader of House Varley became an outgoing\nand authoritative individual, taking part in public policy.\nShe even took on a very muscular husband.
13566	After the war, Seteth remained at the monastery and\ndedicated himself to the restoration of the church. He was\nsoon joined by Bernadetta, who abandoned her inheritance\nto House Varley and took up residence at Garreg Mach to\ncommit to a life as a recluse. As the years wore on, Seteth\nwrote many fables, first in his spare time, and then later as\nhis main preoccupation. His stories became famous among\nchildren throughout F√≥dlan. As he gained renown, many\nbegan to inquire about the wonderful illustrations that\naccompanied the writing. In response to these questions,\nSeteth was known to shrug and say, "Ask my wife...if you\ncan find her."
13567	After the war, Felix inherited the title of Duke Fraldarius\nfrom his late father, Rodrigue. He married Dorothea,\nand the two began a happy life together. After they had\nfinished restoring Fraldarius territory, Felix traveled across\nF√≥dlan as the king's right hand. Dorothea traveled with\nhim always, and even threw herself into battle alongside\nhim every so often. Tales of their bravery endured for\ngenerations, thanks in no small part to the operas that\nDorothea wrote and composed herself.
13568	Even after the war's end, skirmishes continued to break\nout across F√≥dlan. Learning that there were still places\nwhere he could fight, Felix abandoned his noble title and\nchose to make a living with his sword. He traveled the\nland, and some years later found himself in Enbarr. There\nhe encountered Dorothea, who had just resumed her\ncareer as a songstress in the opera. From that time on,\nno matter how far Felix traveled, he always found himself\ndrawn back to that opera house. It is said that, when\nDorothea saw his face in the crowd, she sang only for him.
13569	After more than 10 proposals, Dorothea finally relented\nand agreed to marry Sylvain. Together they inherited\nGautier territory. With the support of his wife's counsel,\nthe new Margrave Gautier was able to improve relations\nwith the Sreng people, and thereby convince the local\nnobles that Relics and Crests were no longer an absolute\nrequirement for survival. Due to their efforts, they went\ndown in history as an extraordinary lord and lady.\nIt is said that what finally convinced Dorothea to marry\nSylvain was his promise that they would grow old happily\ntogether, and that he was true to his word.
13570	Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid, and inherited\nthe throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared\nindependence from F√≥dlan, and renegotiated Brigid's\ndiplomatic ties to that nation on more equal terms. At\nevery step along the way, she was accompanied by\nDorothea, who had left F√≥dlan behind to support her.\nDorothea used the connections she had made in her time\nat the opera to her benefit, and even worked reluctantly\nwith the F√≥dlan nobility for Petra's sake. The people of\nBrigid were skeptical of her at first, but warmed up to\nher over time. It is said that she became the person whom\nPetra loved the most.
13571	As the new head of House Gloucester, Lorenz first worked\nto restore his own territory, and then expanded his vision\nto include reforms for all F√≥dlan. At the height of his\nstoried political career, he announced his marriage to\nDorothea, who had returned to prominence with the\nMittelfrank Opera Company. The elaborate wedding was\nthe most talked-about social event of the season, and the\nfashions on display from the savvy nobleman and the\nstylish songstress set the trends with young people across\nF√≥dlan for a decade.
13572	Though F√≥dlan had changed, Hanneman's goal remained\nunwavering: to determine the workings of the Crests, and\nto do away with the inequality caused by them. To that\nend, his research resulted in magical tools which could be\nused even without the aid of Crests. This proved to be yet\nanother worthwhile discovery by the Father of Crestology.\nHanneman also became a father in more literal sense, by\nraising many children with his wife, Dorothea. Their\nmarriage was not publicly known, however, as the\nsongstress elected to keep it secret for the sake of both of\ntheir careers.
13573	The Mittelfrank Opera Company was on the brink of\ncollapse until two of its star songstresses, Manuela and\nDorothea, returned to the stage and brought the troupe\nnew life and prominence. They toured all around F√≥dlan,\nsometimes even visiting troops on the front lines, soothing\nhearts with their beautiful songs wherever they went, and\ndonating their profits to the relief and rebuilding effort.\nWhen the damage from the war had finally healed, the\npair once again retreated from the stage, this time retiring\nto a private life together. It is said that their relationship\nwas full of light and love.
13574	Petra took Ashe with her to her homeland of Brigid, where\nshe inherited the throne from her grandfather. With Ashe's\nguidance, she established an order of knights, and used\nthat order to declare independence from F√≥dlan and\nrenegotiate diplomatic ties on more equal terms. Over\nyears of work reforming diplomatic and military policy\ntogether, Petra and Ashe fell in love and eventually were\nmarried. The people of Brigid warmly embraced the\nunion. It is said that the name of the knightly order, the\nBlue Sun, was born of their mutual love of swimming in\nthe sea.
13575	Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid, and inherited\nthe throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared\nindependence from F√≥dlan, and renegotiated Brigid's\ndiplomatic ties to F√≥dlan and Dagda on more equal terms.\nAt every step along the way, she was accompanied and\nsupported by her husband, Ignatz, who had left F√≥dlan\nbehind to be with her. Trade with F√≥dlan boomed under\nPetra's reign, thanks in no small part to the Victor Trading\nCompany. But while Ignatz was happy to support Petra's\ngoals, he remained focused on his work as an artist. His\npicturesque renditions of the Brigid landscape, done in the\nF√≥dlan style, were held in high regard all over the world.
13576	Petra returned to her homeland of Brigid, and inherited\nthe throne from her grandfather. As ruler, she declared\nindependence from F√≥dlan, and renegotiated Brigid's\ndiplomatic ties on more equal terms. Some years later, the\nChurch of Seiros expanded its reach to Nuvelle, a town in\nwestern F√≥dlan. The priest sent to this new church, for the\npurpose of keeping up relations with Brigid, was none\nother than Cyril. He and Petra met frequently, first for\npublic relations, and then for more private reasons. They\nfell in love, and were ultimately wed. It is said that their\nunion served as a symbol for the friendly ties between the\ntwo countries for the whole of their lives.
13577	Though the innocence of the Duscur people was proven,\nprejudice against them still lingered in the Kingdom\ncapital. For this reason, Ashe refused a knighthood when it\nwas offered to him, and chose instead to open an inn that\nspecialized in Duscur cuisine. Dedue began to frequent\nthe place on breaks from his duty as the king's vassal, and\nover time, imparted to Ashe his culinary wisdom. As the\ninn gained popularity, the people of the Kingdom began\nfinally to see the Duscur people in a positive light. This\nled to a reconciliation between the two cultures that came\nrather more quickly than expected.
13578	Two years after the war, Dedue and his wife, Mercedes,\nopened a school in the Duscur residential district in\nFhirdiad. The school educated Duscur children, who had\nnever been given structured learning before, in reading,\nwriting, arithmetic, and even Duscur history. Many years\nlater, when the Duscur people reclaimed their homeland,\nthe people who attended this school were able to resettle\nthere and revive their old culture. Because of this, Dedue\nand Mercedes were forever renowned by the Duscur.
13579	Some time after the war, Dedue and Annette exchanged\nwedding vows in a modest ceremony and then settled\ndown to a life in Fhirdiad. For them, life after marriage\nstayed much the same as before. Dedue continued his duty\nto King Dimitri, and Annette took up a teaching position\nat Fhirdiad's school of sorcery. Though each gave the\nother space for the work that was important to them, they\nmade sure to spend much of their free time together, and\nto bond over the cooking and housework.
13580	After the war, Dedue and Ingrid both served as protectors\nto the newly crowned King Dimitri: the former as his loyal\nvassal, and the latter as a knight sworn to House Blaiddyd.\nThe pair fought side by side on countless occasions, and\nwere known to be inseparable on the battlefield. Tales of\nthe taciturn vassal and the steadfast lady knight were\ntold by bards all throughout F√≥dlan, and it is said that\ntheir friendship helped spark the reconciliation between\nthe peoples of Faerghus and Duscur.
13581	After the war, Dedue returned to Fhirdiad to support\nKing Dimitri's reign as his vassal. As he worked, his wife,\nFlayn, was determined to support him with home-cooked\nmeals. Dedue patiently endured the more disastrous of his\nwife's experiments, while teaching her everything he knew.\nEventually Flayn's talent blossomed and she became\na renowned chef. It is said that those who were lucky\nenough to taste her cooking always asked for more, and\nthat Dedue's eyes lit up with affection and pride when she\ntold him what she was planning to prepare next.
13582	After the war, Dedue returned to Fhirdiad to support\nKing Dimitri's reign as his vassal. Shamir was ever near,\nand as Dedue's trusted partner and a mercenary for the\nroyal family, she complemented his public-facing work\nwith by handling any necessary covert operations. The\ntrusting professional relationship between the two\nblossomed into love, and soon they were married. It is said\nthat, when absolutely no one else was around, they would\nlet down their guard and engage in secret jokes and\nidle chatter.
13583	After the war, Felix and Sylvain inherited their respective\ntitles of Duke Fraldarius and Margrave Gautier, and set to\nwork restoring the Kingdom. Each led a busy life, but that\nonly seemed to enhance their friendship over the years.\nEach became known for making surprise visits to the estate\nof the other, in order to deliver the latest taunting in a\nfriendly but relentless game of one-upmanship. It is said\nthat, in their later years, they became so close that they\npassed away on the same day, as if conceding that one\ncould not live without the other.
13584	Even after the war's end, skirmishes continued to break\nout across F√≥dlan. Learning that there were still places\nwhere he could fight, Felix abandoned his noble title and\nchose to make a living with his sword. Decades later, he\nreunited briefly with Sylvain, who had need of his services\nas Margrave Gautier. Felix departed as soon as the job was\nfinished, however, and the two never met again. Years\nlater, a sword that was thought to have belonged to Felix\narrived on Sylvain's doorstep.
13585	After the war, Felix inherited the title of Duke Fraldarius\nfrom his late father, Rodrigue. A year later he married\nMercedes, who helped complete the rebuilding effort by\npaying special attention to children who had lost their\nfamilies during the war. When their efforts were complete,\nthey settled into a busy life together, with Felix serving as\nthe king's trusted retainer, and Mercedes supporting him\nin all things. It is said that every so often, the pair would\nventure out of their territory in order to visit a graveyard\nfor fallen Imperial soldiers. There, they left flowers on a\nmysterious, unmarked grave, and prayed for the one who\nrested there.
13586	Even after the war's end, skirmishes continued to break\nout across F√≥dlan. Learning that there were still places\nwhere he could fight, Felix abandoned his noble title and\nchose to make a living with his sword. He traveled the\nland, seeking battle as if he had a death wish, but his\nviolent path came to an end when he reunited with\nMercedes. She had begun a new life as a cleric in service to\nthe goddess, and with her kindness and generosity, she was\nable to turn his life around. No one knows what became of\nthem after that, but the tales of a swordsman who made\nwarriors across F√≥dlan tremble with fear all come to an\nend at that point.
13587	After the war, Felix inherited the title of Duke Fraldarius\nfrom his late father, Rodrigue. Some time later, he married\nAnnette, and the pair earned renown together by working\nhard at restoring their territory to and beyond its former\nglory. The people adored the pair: Felix for his fierce\ndetermination, and Annette for her boundless cheer. Years\nlater, Annette threw herself into songwriting, and with the\nsupport and encouragement of her husband, she produced\nmelodies that remained popular for generations. The lyrics\nbecame distorted over time, however, and the original\nmeaning of the music was lost.
13588	After the war, Felix intended to abandon his noble title\nand make a living with his sword. On the day that he was\nto depart, however, he was waylaid by Annette, who\nbegged him not to leave her behind. Instead, she proposed\nthat they relocate to the Officers Academy when it\nreopened, and take up positions as teachers. When the\nschool did reopen, it is said that the new sword instructor\nwas notoriously harsh, but that he eventually learned to\nenjoy his work. He was seen to smile, on occasion, but\nonly in the presence of the friendly professor of sorcery.
13589	After the war, Felix inherited the title of Duke Fraldarius\nfrom his late father, Rodrigue. He married Ingrid, the\ndaughter of Count Galatea, and the couple spared no\nexpense in restoring both their territories, paying special\nattention to Galatea's desperate need for food and funds.\nSome years later, there was an attack on the castle town,\nand the duke lost the use of his sword arm from an injury\nsustained protecting his wife. It is said that he never\nregretted it, as he was only fulfilling a promise that he\nmade to his beloved wife a long time ago.
13590	Even after the war's end, skirmishes continued to break\nout across F√≥dlan. Learning that there were still places\nwhere he could fight, Felix abandoned his noble title and\nchose to make a living with his sword. Unwilling to leave\nhim to travel alone, Ingrid, too, relinquished her claim to\nnobility, and they both became wandering mercenaries.\nThey skirted the line between life and death countless\ntimes in their dangerous work, but once they had a child,\nthey settled down in a small farming village far from their\nhomeland. With all but each other left behind, they began\na warm and tranquil life as a family.
13591	After becoming Duke Fraldarius, Felix married Lysithea,\nwho assisted his efforts to restore both his territory and the\nKingdom at large with countless insights. She became\nknown for walking among the people, sharing with them\nher wisdom. After her death, Felix received a visit from a\nlocal artisan, who brought to him a cake and claimed that\nLysithea had given him the recipe. Felix adored the flavor,\nenjoying that style of cake for the rest of his days. The\npeople acquired a taste for it too, and Lysithea's treat\nbecame traditional in the north of Faerghus.
13592	After the war, Felix abandoned his noble title and chose to\nmake a living with his sword. He traveled the land, seeking\nbattle as if he had a death wish, but his violent path came\nto an end when he happened upon Lysithea, who had been\nliving in a small house in the middle of nowhere with her\nparents. Seeing her‚Äîcondemned to live a shortened life,\nbut smiling and making the most of every day with her\nfamily‚Äîconvinced Felix that life was precious. He gave up\nhis sword to join her, and the two spent their lives baking\nsweets. Lysithea's recipe became known far and wide, and\nthe treat became a tradition for the people of that region.
13593	Leonie took over the mercenary group formerly led by\nJeralt. She made a name for herself as a superb mercenary\nand was eventually hired by the young Duke Fraldarius,\nFelix. He entrusted her with many important tasks, and\nover time, Fraldarius territory became Leonie's home base.\nThe two spent a great deal of time drinking together, but\nFelix, knowing Leonie's reputation and habits, learned to\nextract her payment for the drinks in advance.
13594	After the war, Felix abandoned his noble title and chose to\nmake a living with his sword. He accepted Leonie as his\npartner, and together they became wandering mercenaries.\nTheir different fighting styles complemented one another\nwell, and their combined skill was enough to handle any\nenemy. Some time later, the mercenary group formerly led\nby Jeralt joined them, and under their leadership, became\nthe most feared company in F√≥dlan. After the post-war\nchaos passed, however, work became scarce, and the pair\neventually became so desperate that they rebranded\nthemselves as street performers. They proved surprisingly\ncapable in their new profession.
13595	After becoming Duke Fraldarius, Felix married Flayn,\nand the couple worked tirelessly to restore their territory.\nThanks to Felix's dedication and Flayn's compassion, they\nwere well loved by the people, whom they visited and\nspoke with frequently. Felix served as Dimitri's sworn\nsword throughout his reign, but when the king passed\naway, he gave it up in favor of a quiet life with his wife.\nIn his later years, the sword was only used for parlor tricks,\nsuch as slicing juggled fruit out of the air‚Äîa display of\nskill that never failed to delight Flayn.
13596	Even after the war's end, skirmishes continued to break\nout across F√≥dlan. Learning that there were still places\nwhere he could fight, Felix abandoned his noble title and\nchose to make a living with his sword. He traveled the\nland, seeking battle as if he had a death wish, but his\nviolent path came to an end when he arrived at Garreg\nMach. It was there that he reunited with Flayn, who was\nsaddened to see that Felix had continued to use his sword\nto kill. She left to travel with him, and it is rumored that\nher kindness helped turn his life around. No one knows\nwhat became of them after that, but the tales of a deadly\nswordsman did suddenly cease.
13597	After the war, Ashe was formally knighted and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nThe young and inexperienced lord faced a great deal of\ndifficulty in governing. Though he was famously tenacious\nand never lost heart, it was perhaps only due to the\nconstant counsel of his wife, Mercedes, that he managed to\novercome all obstacles. When not busy governing their\nterritory, the couple lifted one another's spirits by baking\ndelicious sweets for each other. The tradition was so\nheartwarming that it became popular for husbands and\nwives in that region to do the same for generations.
13598	After the war, Ashe was formally knighted and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nHe married Annette, and the couple's combined tenacity,\nintelligence, and courage proved more than a match for\nthe many difficulties they faced in governing. Together\nthey helped Gaspard territory flourish more than it ever\nhad before. From his lowly origins as an orphan, Ashe\ngrew to become a splendid knight, much beloved by his\npeople. After he passed, his story was immortalized in a\nbook that was authored by his beloved wife.
13599	When the new king was crowned in Faerghus, both Ashe\nand Ingrid left their homes to travel to Fhirdiad and\npledge themselves to the royal family as knights. They\neach swore to defend the king, come what may, no matter\nthe cost, and to that end they fought side by side in many\nbattles together. They were both praised for their endless\ndevotion and boundless courage, and their names went\ndown in history as peerless knights. Many tales were told\nof their valor, and how they became indispensable to each\nother over the years. A handful of those stories went so far\nas to suggest that they fell in love and became husband and\nwife, but this may have been an embellishment.
13600	When Galatea territory was seized, Ingrid argued strongly\nfor the preservation of its borders. Her request was\ngranted and she was appointed to rule, but because she\nhad previously abandoned her noble house, she was not\nwell accepted by the people at first. It was thanks to the\nhelp of Ashe, who arrived to serve House Galatea, that she\nwas able to soften the view the people had toward her by\nrestoring the territory and improving its agriculture. As\nGalatea's prosperity grew, so too did the love between\nIngrid and Ashe. Their wedding ceremony was intended to\nbe a simple one, but lavish blessings from the citizenry\nmade it a lively event.
13601	After the war, Ashe was formally knighted, and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nThe young and inexperienced lord faced a great deal of\ndifficulty in governing, until his court was blessed with\na new adviser in Marianne. Using skills imparted to her by\nher adoptive father, Marianne helped Ashe to solidify his\nposition. As the prosperity of Gaspard territory grew, so\ndid a love between them, and soon Margrave Edmund saw\nfit to bless the couple's happy marriage. Years later, Ashe\nasked Marianne what made her choose to help him in the\nfirst place. She simply smiled and said that she decided to\nmake supporting him her dream.
13602	When Rhea resigned her position of archbishop and left\nthe Church of Seiros, Catherine followed, and the pair\nbegan a life of seclusion in the Red Canyon. Years later,\nthey began to hear rumors of a wise young man who had\nbeen knighted and appointed lord of House Gaspard.\nSoon they were approached by that lord, Ashe, who came\nto the Red Canyon to kneel before Catherine and ask her\nto be his wife. With Rhea's encouragement, Catherine was\npersuaded to accept. She left the Red Canyon with him,\nand the two began their journey together.
13603	After the war, Ashe was formally knighted and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nHe asked Catherine, who had left the Knights of Seiros, to\nmarry him, but she declined, convinced that the people of\nGaspard territory would never accept it. Refusing to set\nhis love for Catherine aside, Ashe worked diligently along\nwith the Church of Seiros to expose the full truth of the\nWestern Church's plot. With great persistence, he\nconvinced the people of this truth, and then persuaded\nCatherine finally to reconsider. The people received her\nreluctantly at first, but over time, they recognized her\nvirtue and came to accept her.
13604	After the war, Ashe was formally knighted and appointed\nthe new head of House Gaspard, which had no successors.\nThe young and inexperienced lord faced a great deal of\ndifficulty in governing, until his court was blessed with\na new adviser in Cyril. Using skills he learned during his\ntime as a student at the Officers Academy, Cyril offered\nAshe the advice he needed to grow into a worthy lord.\nOver time, Ashe gained the respect of his people, and\nGaspard territory prospered. The pair swore always to be\nthere to help one another, and remained best friends for\nthe whole of their lives.
13605	As Margrave Gautier, Sylvain devoted his life to improving\nrelations with the people of Sreng. Under his leadership,\nnobles were persuaded that Relics and Crests were not\nnecessary as they'd previously thought. Though he went\ndown in history as an extraordinary lord, he could not\nhave done so without the constant support and counsel of\nhis wife, Mercedes, whose wisdom and guidance brought\nprosperity to the people. The couple built a loving home\nlife, surrounded by happy children, and when Sylvain at\nlast passed away, he was succeeded by his oldest child, who\nbore no Crest.
13606	As Margrave Gautier, Sylvain devoted his life to improving\nrelations with the people of Sreng. Under his leadership,\nnobles were persuaded that Relics and Crests were not\nnecessary as they'd previously thought. Though he went\ndown in history as an extraordinary lord, he could not\nhave done so without the constant support and counsel of\nhis wife, Ingrid, whose wisdom and tenacity ensured that\nthe people would prosper. Sylvain was ever loyal to his\nbeloved wife. The couple had many children, and while\nnot one of them bore a Crest, they were all equally and\nwholeheartedly loved.
13607	After the war, Annette and Mercedes lived separate lives:\nthe former as a teacher at the school of sorcery in Fhirdiad,\nthe latter as a cleric at Garreg Mach. Though they lived\napart, they exchanged letters so frequently and shared\ntheir lives with one another in such detail that it was as\nthough they were side by side. After many decades, they\nresigned their respective positions and reunited at Garreg\nMach. In their final years, they relocated to a modest\nhouse in the Fortress City. It is said that they were happy\ntogether to the very end.
13608	After the war, Mercedes accompanied Lorenz back to his\nhomeland. There, the young heir petitioned his father,\nCount Gloucester, to permit the couple to marry. Though\nthe count initially disapproved of Mercedes's status as a\ncommoner, he was persuaded by her virtues as a person to\nchange his mind. In fact, he praised Lorenz for having a\ntaste in character superior to his own. After Lorenz\nsucceeded his father as lord of the territory, the couple\nfinally wed. With Lorenz's stern approach to governance,\nand Mercedes's open mind, House Gloucester flourished\nunder their rule.
13609	Mercedes left home and opened a small orphanage in the\nFaerghus region with her mother. There, she took in and\nraised children who had lost their families in the war,\nregardless of their blood or circumstances of birth. Some\nyears later, she was reunited with Ignatz, who had\npersuaded his family that he should become a painter and\ntraveled all through F√≥dlan painting beautiful landscapes.\nHis greatest masterpiece, however, was a portrait that was\nentitled The Smiling Saint. It is said that the woman\nwhose face inspired it became the love of his life, and that\nshe spent all of her remaining days close by his side.
13610	Mercedes left home for a life as a cleric at Garreg Mach.\nThere, she took in and raised children who had lost their\nfamilies in the war, regardless of the circumstances of their\nbirth or bloodline. Some years later, she was reunited with\nIgnatz, who had persuaded his family that he should\nbecome a painter and traveled all through F√≥dlan painting\nbeautiful landscapes. His greatest masterpiece, however,\nwas a portrait that was entitled The Smiling Saint. It is\nsaid that the woman whose face inspired it became the\nlove of his life, and that she spent all of her remaining days\nclose by his side.
13611	Mercedes left home for a life as a cleric at Garreg Mach.\nAlois, as Jeralt's successor, officially assumed the role of\ncaptain of the Knights of Seiros. Though the two were\nquite busy with their daily activities, they would often find\ntime to get together in the evenings so Alois could hear\nMercedes's ghost stories. No one can say for certain\nwhether it was the constant exposure to spooky tales or\nsome other cause, but from that time on, Alois's reputation\nbecame that of a totally fearless fighter. Mercedes's quiet\nsupport was widely credited for this increase in bravery.\nHer blessing came to be known as a guarantee of victory.
13612	After the war, Annette and Hanneman both accepted\nteaching positions at Fhirdiad's school of sorcery. There,\nwhile educating the next generation of mages, they made\ngreat strides in their research of Crests and magic.\nWorking side by side, the pair‚Äîformerly teacher and\nstudent, now partners and colleagues‚Äîbrought great\nprogress to the world and prestige to their institution. It is\nsaid that the wait list for students to enroll in either of\ntheir classes was notoriously long.
13613	Gustave discarded the name of Gilbert and reaffirmed his\noath of fealty to King Dimitri and the royal family. After\nreturning to Fhirdiad, he reunited with his wife, who had\nreturned to live with Baron Dominic, and his beloved\ndaughter, Annette, who had begun teaching at the capital's\nschool of sorcery. Though it was initially an awkward\nreunion, over time the family rekindled their love for one\nanother. As the shadow of war receded from the Kingdom,\nthe three spent their days happily making up for lost time.
13614	Raphael returned to his home town to serve his liege lord\nas a knight, and spent his spare time helping out at the inn\nthat his grandfather and sister had opened during his time\naway. One day, Ingrid, who had abandoned her claim to\nHouse Galatea to serve as a knight to the royal family,\narrived to persuade Raphael to join her. It did not take\nmuch convincing. From that day forward, they served\ntogether as partners, fighting together side by side to make\ntheir mark on the history of Faerghus.
13615	When Galatea territory was seized, Ingrid argued strongly\nfor the preservation of its borders. Her request was\ngranted, and she was appointed to rule. Soon after,\nRaphael traveled there to pledge his service to Ingrid. He\ninitially signed on as a knight, but quickly discovered that\nhis services were even more desperately needed by the\nland's farmers, and instead focused his efforts on helping\nGalatea improve its agriculture. Seeing him work side by\nside with the commonfolk, Ingrid became enamored with\nRaphael's character, and eventually asked for his hand in\nmarriage. They held a modest but lively wedding, and the\npeople happily gave their blessing to the union.
13616	Ingrid declined to rule House Galatea, choosing instead\nto serve House Blaiddyd as a knight. As Faerghus worked\nwith the Church of Seiros to advance policy, Ingrid served\nas an envoy between the two. In this capacity, she met\nroutinely with Seteth, whose complete trust in Ingrid\nresulted in fruitful negotiations. Together, Faerghus and\nthe church coordinated extensive relief efforts to return\nprosperity to F√≥dlan. After they had accomplished what\nthey set out to do, it is said that Ingrid and Seteth settled\ndown together in a small village, where they spent their\ndays in peace, farming and fishing.
13617	As the new head of House Gloucester, Lorenz first worked\nto restore his own territory, and then expanded his vision\nto include reforms for all F√≥dlan. At the height of his\nstoried political career, he announced his marriage to\nLysithea. Though the only daughter of the former Count\nOrdelia had already renounced all claim to nobility, the\npeople happily accepted their union. She rarely appeared\nin public, due to health concerns, but it is said that a great\nmany policies credited to Lorenz were actually her ideas.

At the height of his\nstoried political career, he announced his marriage to\nMarianne. Prior to the wedding, she received extensive\ntutelage from her adoptive father, Margrave Edmund, so\nthat by the time they were wed she was fully prepared to\ngovern. The pair was particularly successful in providing\nnew innovations in dairy farming, and came to be known\nas the mother and father of horses and cattle in the region.\nIt is said that Lorenz was rather vexed by the title.

The schools quickly\nflourished, invigorating interest in the arts as well as trade\nwith foreign lands. After many years of success and\nprosperity, the students of the first of these academies\ncrafted a bronze statue of the founding couple to honor\ntheir achievement. The statue stands to this day.

At the height of his\nstoried political career, he announced his marriage to\nLeonie, who had become a renowned mercenary. The\nchoice came as a shock to the public, who could not see\nwhat the pair had in common, but those who knew them\nwell saw it as inevitable due to the strength of the bond\nthey had forged in the war. As a ruling couple, they used\ntheir varying talents to usher in a new age of prosperity\nand carve their names into history.

Even after joining House Gloucester\nand returning to a life among the nobility, however, it is\nsaid that Catherine much preferred relaxing in a tavern to\ndressing up for court.
13624	Raphael returned to his hometown to serve his liege lord\nas a knight, and spent his spare time helping out at the inn\nthat his family had opened during his time away. He was\ncompelled to give up knighthood and manage the inn\nfull-time, however, when his sister Maya suddenly\ndeclared her ambition to become an artist and vanished.\nYears later, when she finally returned, she did so in the\ncompany of another artist: her husband, Ignatz. With\ncheerful support from Raphael's family, Ignatz and his\nwife rose to prominence and, with their unique style,\nset the artistic paradigm in F√≥dlan for a generation.
13625	Raphael returned to his hometown to serve his liege lord\nas a knight, and spent his spare time helping out at the inn\nthat his family had opened during his time away. Due to\nhis grandfather's age, he was compelled before long to give\nup knighthood and manage the inn full-time. Soon after\nthat, the inn began to be frequented by Lysithea and her\nfamily, who had renounced all claim to nobility and begun\na life as commoners. Lysithea found a kindred spirit in\nRaphael's sister, Maya, and before long, found herself\nhelping out around the place too. Eventually she was put\nin charge of the kitchen, where it is said she spent the rest\nof her days happily working.
13626	Raphael returned to his hometown, where he served his\nliege lord as a knight for a time. Later, he gave it up to\npursue his true passion of food by opening up an inn.\nHe got the idea to install a bird feeder outside the place,\ncalling it The Winged Inn & Tavern, and before long, the\nsite began to attract the prettiest birds in the region.\nSoon after that, Marianne made her first visit, and she\nand Raphael enjoyed a happy reunion. Seeing her gift in\ntalking to the birds, he invited her to stay. Marianne\neventually became known as the woman whose talent for\nhandling animals helped an inn to flourish.
13627	Raphael returned to his hometown, where he served his\nliege lord as a knight for a time. Later, he gave it up to\nhelp manage the inn that his family had opened up during\nhis time away. One day, to the great joy of Raphael's sister,\nMaya, Hilda came to visit. Maya had always treasured the\nnecklace Hilda had made for her. Moved by this, Hilda\ngave Maya a new gift of a hair band, which inspired Maya\nto suggest that Raphael convert the inn into an accessory\nshop. Hilda decided to stay and help out, and eventually\nbecame the shop's proprietor and chief artisan. She moved\nin with Raphael, and the two spent their lives happily\ndealing in fashionable accessories.
13628	Leonie took over the mercenary company formerly led by\nJeralt. She ran out of money constantly, however, due to\nsending all of her earnings back to her village, and so\ndeveloped a reputation for unpaid tavern tabs. When she\ncame upon the inn that Raphael had been helping to run\nwith his family, she was overjoyed to finally find a place\nthat would trust her enough to open a new tab. In her\nyears frequenting the establishment, she accrued such a\nmassive debt to Raphael that the only way to pay him off\nwas to work for him. By the time the debt was finally paid,\nshe had moved in with him. They lived together happily\nfor the rest of their days.
13629	Raphael returned to his hometown, where he served his\nliege lord as a knight for a time. Later, he gave it up to\nhelp manage the inn that his family had opened up during\nhis time away. Away from the battlefield and able to eat as\nmuch as he pleased, he eventually began to grow soft. It\nwas around that time that Flayn, who had also neglected\nher training, came to visit. The two helped motivate one\nanother, and together they embarked on a new exercise\nroutine. Thereafter, it is said that their energetic shouts\nand cries of exertion could be heard throughout the\nvillage at any time of day.
13630	Shortly after the war, Shamir gave up the mercenary life\nand disappeared. Raphael searched for her unsuccessfully\nfor a time, but then gave up and returned home to serve\nhis liege lord as a knight. One day, he was given orders to\ndrive off a group of bandits, but upon investigation, he\ndiscovered that all of the bandits' victims were those who\nlined their pockets by preying upon the innocent. Without\nwarning, Raphael resigned his post, said good-bye to his\nfamily, and vanished forever. It is unclear just where he\nwent, but rumors swirled for years of a master archer and a\nhulking giant who spent their lives as highway robbers,\nshaking down those who made victims of others.
13631	Lysithea returned home to help her parents restore their\nfamily land. Years later, when the end to their hard work\nwas finally in sight, she relinquished House Ordelia's claim\nto nobility, and the family retreated from the public eye.\nIn her new life as a commoner, she had a chance reunion\nwith Ignatz, who had persuaded his family to allow him to\ntravel the world as an artist. Lysithea became enchanted by\nhis determination, and by the landscapes and portraits he\npainted of all he had seen in his travels. She offered the\nremainder of her short life in support of his work. It is said\nthat Ignatz's most famous piece, Portrait of a Goddess,\nused Lysithea's face as a reference.
13632	Marianne returned home to a warm welcome from her\nadoptive father, who recognized her wisdom and skill and\nbegan to groom her as his successor. During that time, she\nhad a chance reunion with Ignatz, who had persuaded his\nfamily to allow him to travel the world as an artist.\nMarianne wholeheartedly supported his work, and before\nlong, came to be enchanted not merely by the landscapes\nand portraits of all he had seen in his travels, but also by\nhis character. The romance between artist and patron was\nconsidered unusual, but long after their wedding, the story\nof how they fell in love was immortalized in popular plays.
13633	After Hilda returned home, her fashionable accessories\nachieved widespread popularity, leading her to create the\nfirst artisan academy in F√≥dlan. While shopping for art\nsupplies, she had a chance reunion with Ignatz, who had\npersuaded his family to allow him to travel the world as\nan artist. Hilda invited Ignatz to teach at her school,\nand as she and the students became enchanted by the\nlandscapes and portraits of all he had seen in his travels,\nthe two gradually fell in love. Their romance birthed a\nnew style that inspired artists in F√≥dlan for generations.
13634	Leonie took over the mercenary company formerly led by\nJeralt. Though she earned a great deal of renown, the\nwork began to dry up as the postwar chaos subsided. It was\naround that time she had a chance reunion with Ignatz,\nwho had persuaded his family to allow him to wander the\nworld as an artist. Remembering how they had once\npromised to travel together, Leonie disbanded her\nmercenary company and resolved to accompany him.\nThe pair left F√≥dlan, searching for sights hitherto unseen.\nWhere their journey took them remains unknown.
13635	Soon after the war, Flayn disappeared. Ignatz searched\nunsuccessfully for her for a time, but finally gave up and\nwent home. With hard-won permission from his family, he\nthen set out to travel the world as an artist. Years later, his\njourney took him by chance to Garreg Mach, where the\nstatue of Saint Cethleann inspired him to paint. It was\nthen that Flayn finally appeared, wondering aloud why\nIgnatz was not painting her as he'd promised. Overjoyed,\nIgnatz devoted much of the rest of his artistic career to\ngetting Flayn's likeness just right. Her visage was finally\ncaptured in the work he called The Second Advent of a\nSaint, which was widely regarded as a masterpiece.
13636	Soon after the war, Shamir disappeared. Ignatz searched\nunsuccessfully for her for a time, but finally gave up and\nwent home. With hard-won permission from his family, he\nthen set out to travel the world as an artist. Years later, he\nencountered Shamir by chance at an inn. When she saw\nthat Ignatz had not yet left F√≥dlan, she encouraged him to\nleave the region, and offered to stay at his side and guard\nhim until he did. It is rumored that he was overjoyed by\nthis offer, and that the pair soon departed F√≥dlan to the\nwest by sea, but where they traveled after that is unknown.
13637	After the war, Lysithea returned to her parents in Ordelia\nterritory. She was joined by Hanneman, and together the\ntwo worked to research a method by which to extend her\nlifespan. Some years later, their efforts bore fruit, and they\ndevised a procedure to remove her Crests. Afterward,\nLysithea renounced her noble claim and continued to\nassist Hanneman with his research. When he passed, she\ntook up his mantle, and by the great discoveries she made,\ncame to be called the Golden Child of Crestology.
13638	Lysithea returned home to help her parents restore their\nfamily land. Years later, when their work was at an end,\nshe journeyed to Garreg Mach to inform the church of her\ndecision to relinquish House Ordelia's claim to nobility.\nThere she encountered Cyril, who had since graduated\nfrom the Officers Academy and joined the Knights of\nSeiros. During their reunion, Cyril confessed his love to\nLysithea and asked her to marry him. She declined, at first,\ndue to her shortened lifespan, but in the face of Cyril's\ninsistence, she chose to spend what days she had remaining\ntogether with him. Where they went is unknown, but it is\nsaid that, for however long it lasted, they were happy.
13639	After returning to their respective homes, Hilda and\nMarianne stayed in touch and deepened their friendship\nthrough letters. Hilda informed Marianne that her passion\nfor crafting fashionable accessories had given her the idea\nto start an artisan academy, and in response, Marianne\npledged the financial support of the house of Margrave\nEdmund. Soon, artisan schools began to appear all over\nF√≥dlan, producing talented craftsmen and high-quality\ntrade goods, which contributed greatly to the prosperity\nof F√≥dlan. The accessories sent to Marianne personally by\nHilda became some of the most highly valued treasures\nin history.
13640	After the war, Marianne and Hanneman stayed in touch\nand deepened their friendship through letters. When\nHanneman's Crest research fell on hard times, Marianne\nwas able to secure Margrave Edmund's financial support to\nallow his work to continue. The research bore fruit in the\nform of magical tools which could be used even without\nthe aid of Crests, and the funding allowed these tools to be\nproduced in great number. After Marianne inherited her\nadoptive father's house, she guided Hanneman to create a\nbranch of research devoted to peaceful applications of\nCrestology. These advancements, which Hanneman\nprovided, became the legacy of Marianne's later years.
13641	After the war, Seteth dedicated himself to the restoration\nof the church. He continued to write fables for children in\nhis spare time, but became dissatisfied with the hobby\ndue to a lack of quality illustrations for his work. When\nHilda learned of this, she jumped at the chance to visit\nGarreg Mach and illustrate some of Seteth's newer stories\nfor him. The completed fables were distributed far and\nwide, and the children who loved them eventually passed\nthe famous and beloved works on to their own children\nand grandchildren.
13642	Hilda returned to her territory, and founded the first\nartisan academy in F√≥dlan. Years later, as the successful\nheadmaster of that school, she journeyed to Garreg Mach\nto make a donation to the church. There she encountered\nCyril, who had graduated from the Officers Academy and\njoined the Knights of Seiros. When each saw how much\nthe other had grown and matured, a mutual attraction\nbetween them blossomed naturally into love. Cyril\neventually left the church to become a knight of House\nGoneril, at the invitation of Hilda's brother, Holst.\nAs Holst's new brother-in-law, Cyril provided essential aid\nin negotiations with House Goneril's Almyran neighbors.
13643	While Seteth remained at the monastery after the war to\nrestore the Church of Seiros, Leonie wandered the land in\npursuit of her dream to become an elite mercenary. It\nseemed as if their paths would never cross again. Years\nlater, after they had achieved their goals, both retired and\ndisappeared from the public eye at the same time, as if it\nhad been prearranged. Though no official records of their\nlives after that time exist, it is rumored that a happy couple\nresembling them was sighted in a small mountain village.\nThe couple was known for their excellent fishing skills,\nand for cooking up their bountiful catches for all the local\nvillagers and travelers.
13644	Leonie joined up with the mercenaries formerly led by\nJeralt. As his greatest apprentice, she quickly took on a\nleadership role, and eventually even inherited the title of\nBlade Breaker. No matter where she went, however, she\nwas burdened with Jeralt's unpaid tavern tabs. Angry with\nAlois for pushing these debts upon her, she went to see\nhim with the intention of forcing him to pay half the debt.\nBut when she arrived, she found a suntanned Alois happily\nlounging after a hard day's work on his family farm. Leonie\nfound herself unable to go through with it. She did become\na world-renowned mercenary, but she spent the whole\nof her career paying off debt.
13645	Leonie joined up with the mercenaries formerly led by\nJeralt. As his greatest apprentice, she quickly took on a\nleadership role, and eventually even inherited the title of\nBlade Breaker. No matter where she went, however, she\nwas burdened with Jeralt's unpaid tavern tabs. Angry with\nAlois for pushing these debts upon her, she went to Garreg\nMach to force him to pay half the debt. She encountered a\nsmiling Alois, who had become captain of the Knights of\nSeiros, and who was all too happy in his new prosperity to\ntake the debts back on. It is said that Leonie developed\nquite the drinking habit once she was free to visit taverns\nwhenever she liked.
13646	Leonie assumed leadership of the mercenaries formerly led\nby Jeralt. One day, she was hired to protect a noble who\nhad been warned of a bandit attack. The warning note\nlisted all of the noble's foul deeds, and was signed with the\nimage of a spider, which Leonie recognized. Just as she\nsuspected, the one who came on the appointed day was\nnone other than Shamir. Leonie was happy to break her\ncontract on this occasion, and even offered Shamir a\nposition in her company. The result was the most famous\nmercenary group ever to exist in F√≥dlan. It is said that \ntheir flag bore the image of a spider, and...another vaguely\narachnid creature.
13647	While Flayn disappeared soon after the war, Seteth stayed\nat the monastery and worked to restore the authority of\nthe Church of Seiros. Doing away with his old strictness,\nhe adopted a tolerant stance toward all, and encouraged\nhis followers to do the same. When he was satisfied that\nthe message was received, he vanished from the monastery.\nSeveral centuries later, a man and a woman in ancient\nattire emerged to a F√≥dlan that had drastically changed.\nWhen she asked the man beside her if it would be all right\nin this new era to call him "Father," he said that perhaps it\nwould be better to remain on the safe side.
13648	After the war, Seteth remained at the monastery to rebuild\nthe church. Several years of hard restorative work later, he\nreceived a letter from Manuela. She wrote that she had\ntraveled to a small, war-torn town and opened up a school\nfor children. Reminded of the beauty and compassion in\nManuela's heart, Seteth was moved to leave the monastery\nand join her there. As they worked together to manage the\nbudding institution, the couple fell in love and eventually\nwere married. It is said that their students were overjoyed.
13649	After the war, Seteth fully confessed his love to Catherine\nand asked her to marry him. Intending to accompany Rhea\nto a life of seclusion, however, Catherine declined. Over\nthe years, as Seteth worked to rebuild the church from the\nmonastery, he continued to write love letters to Catherine.\nWhen the rebuilding effort was complete, he journeyed to\nthe Red Canyon, where she and Rhea had been living, and\ndelivered all of his letters by hand. Catherine was deeply\nmoved, and with Rhea's blessing and no more reason to\nrefuse him, she accepted his proposal. The two were wed\nand lived out their lives happily alongside Rhea.
13650	After the war, Seteth fully confessed his love to Catherine\nand asked her to marry him. Refusing to remain at the\nmonastery, however, Catherine declined. Over the years,\nas Seteth worked to rebuild the church, he continued to\nwrite love letters to Catherine. Her answer was always the\nsame. Finally, when the rebuilding effort was complete,\nSeteth left the church and went to see her, declaring his\nlove anew. With no more reason to refuse him, she at last\naccepted his proposal. The two were wed, and swore to\nwalk side by side together through the new age.
13651	After the war, Hanneman and Manuela held a grand\nwedding ceremony, to which all of their many students\nwere invited. Later, after the church was transformed and\nrehabilitated under the supervision of the Empire, the\nOfficers Academy finally reopened, with a renewed focus\non accepting students regardless of status and offering\nclasses on a wider variety of practical subjects. Hanneman\nand Manuela returned to work as teachers, almost as if\nnothing had changed, and filled the halls with their banter\nin the way only married couples can.
13652	After the war, Hanneman and Manuela held a grand\nwedding ceremony, to which all of their many students\nwere invited. Later, as Garreg Mach came to be restored,\nthe Officers Academy finally reopened, with a renewed\nfocus on accepting students regardless of status. Manuela\nand Hanneman returned to work as teachers, almost as if\nnothing had changed, and filled the halls with their banter\nin the way only married couples can. Their relationship\nspawned a trend of romances among colleagues at the\nOfficers Academy, but that is an entirely different story.
13653	Alois officially took up the title of captain of the Knights\nof Seiros. In this new role, he led the knights to many\nvictories, and was much beloved. At the same time, he\ndeveloped a reputation for gullibility, and his subordinates\nbegan to play tricks on him regularly. To help him deal\nwith this, Catherine volunteered her services as an adviser.\nShe kept a lookout for him, and put a stop to these antics\nbefore they began. The combination of the kindly captain\nand the intimidating wielder of Thunderbrand proved\nstrong, and the Knights of Seiros prospered.
13654	After quitting the Knights of Seiros, Catherine and Shamir\nset out on a lifelong journey together. The pair were\ninseparable as they traveled across F√≥dlan, and eventually\nwound up in Shamir's homeland of Dagda. They faced\nmany hardships on their adventures, some of which were\nself-inflicted, as the duo had a way of sticking their noses\ninto others' business in their efforts to right wrongs. It is\nsaid, however, that no foe they encountered ever proved\na match for the combined might of Shamir's marksmanship\nand Catherine's Thunderbrand.
13655	Shortly after the war, Shamir and Cyril disappeared from\nthe ranks. The Knights of Seiros searched unsuccessfully\nfor them for some time, but finally resigned themselves to\nthe loss. Though the pair was never officially heard from\nagain, rumors swirled persistently for years of two master\narchers turned thieves. Initially the knights received\ncomplaints and investigated, but when it was discovered\nthat the pair only lined their pockets by shaking down\nthose who preyed upon the innocent, they decided it was\nnot an investigation worth pursuing. The thieves' story\nbecame a folktale beloved by the people.

13723	Ingrid declined to rule House Galatea, choosing instead\nto serve House Blaiddyd as a knight. Some years later, she\nwas reunited by chance with Ignatz, who had persuaded\nhis family that he should become a painter and traveled all\nthrough F√≥dlan painting beautiful landscapes. Ignatz\ndecided to paint Ingrid that day, and spent much of the\nrest of his career working to get her likeness just right.\nThere were many depictions of her bravery in battle, of\ncourse, but later generations would most fondly remember\nthe way he captured her smile, which was widely believed\nto be that of a loving wife.
13724	When Galatea territory was seized, Ingrid argued strongly\nfor the preservation of its borders. Her request was\ngranted, and she was appointed to rule, but because she\nhad previously abandoned her noble house, she was not\nwell accepted by the people. It was thanks to Ignatz that\nthe mood of the people finally softened. He showed them,\nthrough his artwork, a side of Ingrid that they had not yet\nseen: her valor and bravery, fighting in defense of F√≥dlan.\nThe people were moved, first by the artwork itself, and\nlater by the woman who had inspired it. As time passed,\nand the region prospered, Ingrid and Ignatz bonded over\ntheir reunion. They fell in love and eventually were wed.
13725	After the war, Annette and Mercedes lived separate lives:\nthe former as a teacher at the school of sorcery in Fhirdiad,\nthe latter as the proprietor of an orphanage in a village in\nthe Faerghus region. Though they lived apart, they\nexchanged letters so frequently and shared their lives with\none another in such detail that it was as though they were\nside by side. After many decades, Annette decided to\nresign from her post and move to the village where\nMercedes lived to help run the orphanage. The life they\nlived there was modest, but it is said that they were happy\nto the very end.
13726	This is a relationship that reaches support level A but has\nno further developments.

222	Um, this is for me? Are you sure?
223	I guess I can take this.

225	Ick. Thanks, I guess?
226	Can't let it go to waste.
227	Oh. You shouldn't have.
228	What...is this?
229	I'll take it, although goddess knows why.
230	Where do you want me to throw this away?
231	Why would you give me such a thing?
232	I'll take this for now.
233	I'll take it, if I must.
234	If you insist.
235	I'll take it but, uh...yuck.

305	That smell... It's amazing! My fav, in fact.\nDo you like it too?
306	While I have little interest in food, I will admit to\na weakness for this one dish.
307	Delicious! After a scrumptious meal like that, I feel\nthat I can really seize the day.
308	This is my favorite. I am rather happy you went out \nof your way to pick it, Professor.
309	I can eat so much of this stuff! My stomach's\ngrowling just thinking about it!
310	Ooo, this is my favorite! You've got great taste!
311	I think I like this, but it's been a while,\nso I'm not sure.
312	I would be liking that greatly!
313	I like this.
314	That looks appetizing.
315	This looks delicious! Let's eat!
316	Yeah, you just get it, Professor! This is my favorite!
317	This is my absolute favorite! How did you\nknow, Professor?
318	Ooh, I love this stuff! Did you know that?
319	I appreciate any good meal, but nothing beats\nenjoying my favorite food.
320	I did not expect much from the dining hall, but this\ndoes not disappoint.
321	This is delicious! My absolute favorite!
322	This food is a revelation! Haha! I can't help but\nsmile when I eat it!
323	Eating delicious food really takes my worries away.
324	I like this dish. It was my father's favorite...
325	Yummy! Who made this? I'll have to give my\ncompliments to the chef.
326	That looks delicious. Goddess forgive me, I've just\ngot to indulge!
327	The flavor is nostalgic to me, for some reason. \nHmm. I'd like some more.
328	This is nearly as delicious as Mother's cooking.\nI would happily eat this every day.
329	This is my most favorite dish of all. I love it almost\nas much as Crestology itself!
330	This is a wonderful dish. You could sell this in any\nrestaurant in the capital.
331	This is my favorite dish. Did someone tell you?
332	Oh, my favorite food! You've gotta try this.
333	Eating food always fires me up! Hoorah! Let's go\nfight somebody!
334	Hmm. I like seeing a table full of my favorite dishes.

403	When I think of the past, it makes me grateful for\nthings like having a nice, relaxing meal.
404	Looks good. I will eat well and restore my strength.
405	Eating is life. Literally. You'd die without it.\nAnd I'm always happy to share a meal with you.
406	You seem to dine with company often, unlike me.
407	As a noble, I try to ensure my manners are perfect.\nHere I can relax a bit, however.
408	You know, sometimes I forget to eat. Does that ever\nhappen to you, Professor?
409	You're eating too slow, Professor! You just gotta\nstick all of it in your mouth!
410	I'd rather eat alone in my room, but since that's\napparently not allowed...OK.
411	I don't like being hit on during a meal, so it's nice\nto be with you.
412	Eating with friends is warming for the heart.
413	Let us eat.
414	I'm happy to eat alone, but all right.
415	Somehow, everything tastes better with company.
416	I realized it after I got to the monastery‚Äînobody\nin Faerghus knows how to cook.
417	I know! Let's have tea together after our meal!
418	Eating alone is nice, but I think I prefer eating with\na friend.
419	I think it's wonderful to be able to eat a nice meal\nevery day.
420	Smaller bites will make you look more refined, while\nat the same time helping you feel full and content.
421	When it comes to food, I don't know if I could\nchoose between quality and quantity!
422	I'll fondly remember eating this meal with you.
423	Simple days like today are probably the ones you'll\nthink back on fondly. You know?
424	I'm sorry... I know I'm boring company...
425	It's kinda nice to break bread with you! Got any\ninteresting stories to tell while we eat?
426	I'm grateful I get to eat every day. May the goddess\nbless this fine meal!
427	It is nice to share a meal with others, now and again.
428	My brother used to scold me for being too picky,\nso I have grown to develop a taste for most things.
429	You should continue eating, of course. However, do\nyou mind answering a few questions?
430	My pastimes? Well, good food. And drinking. And...\nUmm... Mostly drinking.
431	This smells good. I thank you.
432	Captain Jeralt and I used to enjoy meals together,\njust like this.
433	Food always tastes better when you're sharing a meal\nwith others.
434	Food tastes better when shared with good company.
435	I've got food to eat and a place to sleep. I'm pretty\ndarn happy with my life right now.

503	Hmm, it's good to be able to speak freely, to express\nboth my likes...and dislikes.
504	This should...suffice.
505	I'm not a fan of this food, but...I can't be picky.\nI'll just hold my nose and gut through it.
506	I am not picky, but...honestly, this is terrible.
507	Ugh. This food is not to my liking, but I will keep\nat it. Perhaps it is an acquired taste...
508	Should I be less picky about what I eat, or should we \njust find better food?
509	I'm not normally a picky eater, but I don't think I'd\never order this on my own...
510	Actually, um...I'm not hungry. You can have mine!
511	I'm pretty sure I don't like this, but I'll be OK\nas long as it's edible.
512	The food of F√≥dlan has...great strangeness.
513	I will not be picky.
514	To be strong, I must eat. No matter how disgusting\nthe food might be.
515	Honestly, this is not my favorite. No, I'm not offering\nit to you! I'll still eat it.
516	Yeah, it isn't always the best, but that's OK. Let's try\nto enjoy whatever we eat.
517	Hmm... This isn't my favorite, but it's rude not to\nfinish what's on my plate.
518	To be honest, I'm not fond of it... But I have no\nchoice, do I?
519	Oh, it's nothing. I was just remembering when\nfamine struck Galatea territory...
520	Posture and dignity while dining are essential for a\nnoble. Even if the quality of the meal is poor.
521	I'm not gonna say no to food, but I hope there's some\ntasty meat on the menu next time...
522	Not my favorite food, but I'll eat it... Here goes...
523	Ugh, I mean, I eat plenty of different things, but this?\nDefinitely not my favorite.
524	I...don't have much of an appetite. Please, eat\nwithout me.
525	I'm glad you were here to distract me from how bad\nthis tastes. Otherwise, I wouldn't have finished.
526	Whatever's served, I'll eat. No complaints.
527	Unfortunately, I have little time for leisure. I must\nfinish up quickly and return to work.
528	There are not many foods I will refuse, but that\ndoes not mean I will eat just anything...
529	Oh, blegh! Blegh! No good. Nope. My stomach is\nscreaming in rejection. Would you eat it instead?
530	Professor, would you like to eat my helping? I've had\nenough and need to stay in shape.
531	I have a bitter memory associated with this dish.\nOf course I'll eat it, but...
532	I'll keep eating, although I can hardly stomach\nthis food.
533	Blah, this is some pretty lousy food. But as long as\nit's edible, right?
534	I suppose it's rude to the cook if I don't eat.
535	This is terrible. I can't... No. I have to eat it.

605	We can't blaze ahead if we let the status quo\nconfine us. Let's try coloring outside the lines...\nonly with food.
606	Meat and fish are my area of expertise. Though I\nstill have not mastered seasoning.
607	I may not look like it, but I know how to cook.\nNot that I am very experienced.
608	I'll be most useful as a taste tester. The rest is all you,\nProfessor. Oh, I'm just kidding.
609	All right! Leave it to me! I'll fry it, grill it, and try\nnot to burn it!
610	Sounds fun! Let me show you my cooking talent.
611	I can cook...food. But not anything you'd call\n"cuisine."
612	It is necessary to be having fresh ingredients\nfor cooking.
613	I enjoy cooking.
614	You want me to cook? Not that I don't have\nexperience, but...
615	I love to cook! What are we making today?
616	Cooking... Cooking... Heh. Well, it'll all work out \nsomehow...maybe.
617	I enjoy baking sweets, but I'm not sure how I'll do\ncooking other types of food.
618	Please leave it to me! Cooking is my forte! At least,\nI think it is...
619	Cooking? Sure, that sounds nice. Let's make a\ndelicious meal!
620	I've not much experience with cooking, but I am sure\nto be flawless. How hard could it be?
621	I'm really good at eating food, but I'm not sure about\nmaking it.
622	Ah, yes, cooking. I'm far from an expert, but I'll do\nwhat I can.
623	Cooking is easy once you understand the basics.
624	I-I do some cooking...
625	I'm a decent cook, but nothing to write home about.\nDon't set your expectations too high.
626	I may not look it, but I'm a pretty good cook. Now,\ncome on, ingredients! Let's dance!
627	I have a little culinary skill, but keep your\nexpectations modest.
628	My mother was an excellent cook. You would think\nsuch a talent would be hereditary.
629	Oh my. Did you choose me without knowing of my\nabysmal cooking skills?
630	My cooking is so good, it's been called seductive.\nShould I show you what I can do, Professor?
631	I have some experience with cooking. I am sure I\ncan aid you in the kitchen.
632	At last, a chance to show off my cooking skills!
633	You can cook too, huh? Let's see who's better.
634	Cooking? I can handle that.
635	I don't really know how to cook, but I'll still help ya.

703	This would go a lot quicker if I could just use an\naxe or a sword.
704	I have no problem if the recipe gives a measurement.\nEyeballing such things...is not my specialty.
705	This combination of ingredients is creative, right?\nNow I just need to cut them to the proper sizes...
706	Overcooked meat is too bland. I prefer it to\nbe bleeding.
707	Ach, this is a tough recipe. Whoa! Oh, rats...\nNo, I can do it!
708	You'll find it turns out best if you just follow the \nrecipe until the food is done. Easy.
709	Sorry for making you do all the work, Professor.\nI mess up the ingredients every time!
710	A little more secret spice, and‚Äî Hey! No peeking.
711	I just think it's all the same once it's in your stomach,\nso why overdo it with the cooking, right?
712	One day, I will be showing you cooking from\nmy homeland.
713	You seem to know what you are doing.
714	Cooking's a bit like hunting, but less satisfying.
715	I have a lot of experience in the kitchen. I can make\njust about anything.
716	If you just follow the recipe, most things will come \nout fine. I think.
717	Cooking is much more exciting than studying\nor training!
718	I don't usually have a problem, but...sometimes\nthings get out of control.
719	You're not going to throw away that vegetable, right?\nWhat a waste... We should use it in our dish!
720	I have a firm idea of the end result, but the process\nis another matter entirely...
721	Try throwing everything together and pouring in\nsome salt. I'd eat that!
722	I want to make sure the final product looks colorful\nas well as appetizing.
723	Let's...uh not use that vegetable. Technically it's\nedible, but it's not highly favored.
724	My mother taught me when I was very young...but I\ncan't make anything complicated.
725	Cooking can be kinda fun sometimes! Though not\nsomething I'd wanna do every day.
726	Don't worry too much about all the details. Just do\nwhat feels right, and the tasty food will follow!
727	When you have a lot of time to yourself, you learn\na few things.
728	A bit of this, a bit of that! This will make it all the\ntastier, do you not agree?
729	It might be better if I just watch... We won't be able\nto finish like this. I might burn the water.
730	I do so enjoy cutting up vegetables in preparation to\ncook. So, I'll do that and leave you with the cleanup.
731	How the meal tastes affects the morale of the troops. \nAn army marches on its stomach, you know.
732	Aha! There. Looks tasty, doesn't it? Needs a little\nmore salt.
733	You've got deft hands, I admit. Now see what I\ncan do!
734	What's the next step? It's easy if I have orders\nto follow.
735	I've stoked the fire and stirred the pots and scrubbed\nthe pans, but I've never done the cooking.

803	Our voices are all over the place. We must learn to\nwork together in harmony.
804	It is not guaranteed to be good, even if everyone\nsings earnestly. It is not easy, after all...
805	There's someone who's slightly off... Oh well.\nThat adds some color, I suppose.
806	Must I? Fine. But I will sing it solemnly.
807	Professor! Let me sing for you! Do you not like\nmy voice? It would make a pegasus dance with joy!
808	I may sound terrible, but you won't notice when \neveryone else sings too.
809	Yeah! I'll sing so loud that my voice is gonna reach\nthe sky!
810	They won't notice if one person doesn't sing,\nwill they? Heh-heh!
811	I'll keep my voice down. Don't want people thinking\nI'm vying for attention. But how loud is too loud?
812	Learning these things gives me great\ndifficult...difficulty.
813	Singing in tune with others proved quite difficult.
814	Not sure I should sing with everyone. I'm not great\nat harmonizing.
815	Am I doing all right? I hope I'm not too off...
816	It's hard to sneak out when the professor is watching.
817	I hope this song reaches the goddess's ears.
818	Singing is so much fun! Everyone should enjoy\nthemselves while they're doing it!
819	Regardless of the quality, this is a good chance for us\nto prove our solidarity.
820	‚ô™Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi‚Äî‚ô™ Ahem! Hmm... Something\nappears to be wrong with my throat.
821	Everyone should sing louder. It feels so good just to\nlet it out!
822	Music speaks to the heart. It's more powerful than\nany weapon.
823	Singing with others is a nice change of pace. Usually\nI do it when I'm alone...
824	I can't sing very loud...
825	Singing's OK, but I should really have a cute dance\nto go along with it.
826	What's the point of singing practice? It's not going\nto make me stronger.
827	May my song reach the goddess in the sky.
828	It is so much fun to sing with others!
829	The utter discord... I cannot stand it! I do wish\neveryone would listen to one another.
830	This is no good. Sing from your diaphragm,\nLaaaa! Get it? Laaaaa!
831	Listen to the others and harmonize. Work together. \nThe same in music as on the battlefield.
832	Ah! It feels good to sing nice and loud, fill my\nchest up with sound!
833	You look like a cat that's been sprayed with water.\nWhat, you don't think I should sing the high notes?
834	Is this necessary? I'll sing if I must.
835	I've never sung a song before, so I don't know if I'm\ngood or bad at it.

907	I feel like a new man.
908	This is nothing more than the result of \ngreat coaching.
909	This is incredible! I've got a new talent!
910	I guess I've got some talent.
911	I feel like I learned something new.
912	I have been learning much.
913	I did not know I had such a talent.
914	A new power that I could use.
915	Is this my true talent?
916	I didn't know I could do that...
917	Is this really something I can do?
918	Who knew I could do this...
919	I didn't know I had it in me...
920	I've discovered a whole new side of me.
921	Whoa. I didn't know I could do that!
922	I had no idea I could do something like this.
923	Talent like this, hidden away...
924	How could someone like me do this?
925	Go figure! I didn't know I had it in me.
926	Didn't know I had it in me!
927	I have yet more power to unleash.
928	I still have talent, I see!
929	I seem to have broken new ground.
930	I always knew I could do that if I tried.
931	Hmm. I did not realize I possessed such a strength.
932	Who knew I could do something like this?
933	A new power I can wield!
934	Huh. I didn't know I had such a talent.
935	Oh, wow. Could I always do this?

1012	I have understanding.
1013	I answered correctly.
1014	It was nothing.
1015	That's a relief.

1017	Thank you, Professor! I couldn't have done it\nwithout you!
1018	Yes! That's it!
1019	Looks like I did it!
1020	This was hardly a challenge for me.
1021	Ha! Looks like I got it right!
1022	I can't believe I got it right!
1023	Easier than I thought.
1024	I can't believe it...
1025	Yeah! Who's the best? I'm the best.
1026	No problem.
1027	Naturally. Did you expect anything less?
1028	I have done it!
1029	Just as I've always expected.
1030	Of course I was right.
1031	I am good now, am I?
1032	Still got it!
1033	So. I was right.

1307	A noble can make mistakes, like anybody.
1308	What? Was I wrong somehow?
1309	What?! How could I be wrong?
1310	I didn't know the answer! I'm sorry!

1312	I do not have enough understanding...
1313	I was certain I had it.

1316	What, I failed? How?

1320	Preposterous...
1321	That one was a little tough for me...
1322	Of course I got it wrong.

1328	I failed...
1329	Huh? How could I have been wrong about that?
1330	Hang on! You're telling me I was wrong?
1331	Hmm. I find it difficult to believe I was wrong.

1404	Thanks. I'm a bit embarrassed...
1405	Heh. I could get used to this.
1406	Heh. Flattery will get you nowhere.
1407	I am quite pleased.
1408	How embarrassing. I'm not used to such praise.
1409	I'll get it next time too!
1410	Heh-heh! Thanks! That's reassuring.
1411	You're quite the motivator, Professor.
1412	You are giving me praise? I will get more soon!
1413	No need for praise.
1414	Of course I got it. No need to butter me up.
1415	Hahaha, you're making me blush.
1416	All right, that's enough praise.
1417	I'm sure I'll get it again next time!
1418	Haha, I'll get the next one too!
1419	Ah, no big deal.
1420	It was only a trifle.
1421	You really think I'm that great?
1422	No, I just got lucky.
1423	Don't stop. Keep it coming.
1424	Oh! I'll try to get the next one too!
1425	I'm glad I put in some effort...for once.
1426	Nothing to get excited about.
1427	Let's not exaggerate...
1428	No need to discontinue with the praises.
1429	No matter how old one gets, it's always nice to hear \n"job well done!"
1430	What now? Do I get a reward?
1431	I appreciate the praise, Professor.
1432	Oh, you're just flattering me.
1433	You're too kind. Now I'm feeling a bit shy...
1434	Your praise is appreciated.
1435	Aw, thanks, Professor. That's real nice of ya to say.

1505	Stop being nice about it. That's not necessary...
1506	Your concern is unnecessary.
1507	What a thing to say. Do I look that pitiful?
1508	I suppose I must try harder next time.
1509	It's all right... I know I messed up.
1510	That's...really kind...
1511	Oh, Professor. You're too kind.
1512	I would like to be having more guidance, please.
1513	I prefer constructive advice over kind words.
1514	You pity me. I'm pathetic.
1515	It's all right. I've got this.
1516	OK. You can stop it.
1517	Thank you for being so kind, Professor.
1518	I'll get it next time... Count on it!
1519	I'm fine, really.
1520	You're only making it worse.
1521	It's all right. I'll get over it!
1522	I'm sorry. I'll do better next time.
1523	That's OK. I just need to work harder.
1524	I'm sorry... I'll have to do better...
1525	Hm. I'll get it next time.
1526	Oh, don't patronize me.
1527	No need for that. I will persevere.
1528	Professor... I will work harder.
1529	No need to console me. I am a professional.
1530	Even I feel like crying sometimes.
1531	No consolation is needed.
1532	Thank you, Professor. You're too kind...
1533	Oh, stop. Don't butter me up.
1534	I'll do better next time.

1605	Sorry... I'll take this seriously next time.
1606	I will humbly reflect on this.
1607	Just watch. It will not happen again.
1608	Failure. Hmm... I'm not used to that.
1609	Whoa! I'll try harder next time!
1610	I'll try harder next time!
1611	Aw, I knew that answer.
1612	I did not have success. Please, be guiding me.
1613	I accept your judgment.
1614	I know. I agree.
1615	I promise I'll try harder!
1616	I'll have to do better next time.
1617	I'm sorry... I promise I'll do better next time.
1618	Oh no... I'm sorry.
1619	Next time for sure!
1620	I will do better next time!
1621	All right! I'll get it next time!
1622	I guess I'm just no good at this.
1623	I'll certainly do better next time.
1624	I... I can't do this...
1625	I guess you didn't do a good job of teaching me.
1626	I'll never give up!
1627	I am not through yet.
1628	I already feel terrible enough. No need for harshness.
1629	Goodness. What a lack of concern for other's egos.
1630	Professor, be nice and say I was right. Who cares?
1631	I must continue my training.
1632	Hm. Next time, I'm sure.
1633	You're right. I'll get it next time.
1634	OK. I understand.

1810	Wow! You're a genius!

1817	Oh! Of course!
1818	What a wonderful idea!
1819	That's right!
1820	A satisfying answer.
1821	Makes sense to me!

1828	Splendid!
1829	What a superior answer! 
1830	It seems like you just know everything.
1831	Quite correct. Thank you.
1832	Of course! That makes sense.
1833	Huh! Not bad.
1834	As good a reason as any.

1913	I see.
1914	I get it.
1915	That might be good.

2008	...I got it.
2009	I'm not sure about that...
2010	What? That doesn't sound right.
2011	By any chance, are you just giving me a random answer?
2012	I am not understanding...
2013	I don't think you understand the situation.
2014	Wow. I asked the wrong person.

2026	No way.
2027	I'm not sure I comprehend.
2028	That is not very helpful.
2029	That doesn't make me feel better.
2030	That seems...wrong? Yeah. Wrong.
2031	No, I believe that is incorrect.
2032	Hm. That's an interesting answer.
2033	Are you pulling my leg?

3705	Oh, I'm sorry... Did I make you wait?\nI ran as fast as I could!
3706	Did you summon me?
3707	I am honored to be invited. Thank you.
3708	I am happy that you invited me, even though it \ninterferes with my nap time...
3709	What's going on? You didn't want to train? I guess\nthat's fine.
3710	Um, what is it? Did I do something wrong?
3711	Isn't it nice, taking a moment to relax?
3712	You have my thanks for giving me your spare time.
3713	Did you need something?
3714	Why am I here?
3715	Excuse me.
3716	Hey, I couldn't turn down your invitation.
3717	Professor? Did you call for me?
3718	Thank you for inviting me!
3719	Thank you for inviting me.
3720	I am here for the invitation.
3721	Hey, Professor! You called for me, so here I am!
3722	Thank you for inviting me.

3724	Um, did you need something from me?
3725	Wow, thanks for inviting me!
3726	Thanks for inviting me.
3727	This invitation was unexpected.
3728	I am honored that you invited me.
3729	My room works better for me, but I am willing to\ncompromise. For today.
3730	Thank for your invitation. To what do I owe\nthis surprise?
3731	I am honored to be invited.
3732	I'm here, Professor.
3733	Oh, you didn't invite me here for a duel?
3734	You called, so I came.
3735	Do you need me for something, Professor?

3819	I'm here!
3820	I was just thinking that I wanted to speak with you.
3821	I'm here, Professor!
3822	Professor, I'm here. I wanted to take you up on\nyour invitation.
3823	Care to share your thoughts, Professor?
3824	Thank you for inviting me...
3825	Huh! So, this is your room.
3826	It's nice to be invited over.
3827	I appreciate the invitation.
3828	I am pleased that you invited me!
3829	Yes. I will happily tell you all that I know about\nCrests. There's nothing I'd enjoy more.
3830	Well, well. Inviting me to your room...\nThat's intriguing, Professor. Very intriguing.
3831	I appreciate you inviting me.
3832	Hey, Professor! It's been too long.
3833	Thank you for the invitation.
3834	I was just considering paying you a visit.

3904	This smells good. I wonder how it tastes...
3905	Mmm... It's a nice smell. I think I love this one.
3906	I don't ordinarily drink tea, but in this case, I will\ngladly make an exception.
3907	Ah, a miraculous brew! You truly understand tea.
3908	Mmm, this tea is my favorite scent. So relaxing as to\nbe downright sleep-inducing...
3909	Ahh. Oh yeah. I can tell this is a good one. Come on,\nhand it over!
3910	You went out of your way to get my favorite tea?\nThat's so nice!
3911	You're very thoughtful, Professor. So much better\nthan those nobles around here.
3912	This tea is smelling wonderful! Mmm, it is my\nfavorite for drinking.
3913	This tea is my favorite. How did you know?
3914	Oh, that aroma. My favorite tea.
3915	I've had this kind before. It's quite good!
3916	You've got excellent taste, Professor. This is \ngreat tea.
3917	This tea is my favorite! You have very good\ntaste, Professor.
3918	I love this tea! Is it a favorite of yours as well?
3919	What a nice aroma. I really enjoy this tea.
3920	A fresh and fruity aroma! Yes, this is my kind of tea.
3921	I like this tea. It's so tasty!
3922	I'm not very discerning, but I do love this kind of tea.
3923	Oh, this is my favorite tea! Do you...um, have sugar?\nLots, please.
3924	Oh! This tea...it's my absolute favorite!
3925	Whoa! You got my favorite tea!
3926	Mmm, that looks delicious. I think this might be my\nfavorite tea.
3927	Just the way I like it. We must have similar tastes.
3928	You know about my favorite tea. I am moved!
3929	My, but you have exquisite taste in tea. This is one\nof my favorites. I always try to keep some around.
3930	Mmm, what a lovely smell. I like this tea very much.
3931	The scent... It seems we have similar tastes in tea.
3932	That delightful smell...my favorite tea.\nIs it yours too?
3933	Oh, this is my favorite tea! I like the way it looks and\nthe way it tastes.
3934	Ah, my favorite tea. Even the smell calms me...
3935	Thank you! This smell reminds me of the tea I \nreally like.
3936	
3937	I adore this. Thank you for preparing my\nfavorite tea.

4005	Whoa, isn't this the fancy stuff? As in, the expensive\nstuff? I'm excited to find out how it tastes.
4006	Hm... When it comes to tea, they say you get what\nyou pay for.
4007	I enjoy drinking expensive tea like this. You can\nalmost taste how pricey it is.
4008	I've no opinion on tea so long as it's potable, but \nexpensive leaves do pique my interest.
4009	Huh? Ooh, that smells expensive! Is that what you\nusually drink?
4010	This tea's expensive. You, um, already paid for it?
4011	My goodness, so lavish! Is it OK to drink this?\nI love it.
4012	This tea has a high price! I am happy to be drinking\nit, but I am wondering why you would be paying\nso much...
4013	I do not usually get to drink such expensive tea.\nThis is quite a treat.
4014	This tea looks quite expensive. Let's see if it\ntastes expensive.
4015	Oh, wow. These leaves are high quality. Must've\nbeen expensive. Nice aroma though...
4016	This tea must have been expensive. I'm sorry if I \nmade you go out of your way.
4017	This is a very expensive tea, is it not? I've been\nwanting to try it...
4018	Ooh, I'm so excited! I rarely get to drink such\nhigh-quality tea!
4019	This tea is very expensive... I should take my time\nand enjoy every last sip.
4020	Oh my. Would you look at this color? These are\nsome choice tea leaves.
4021	This tea smells expensive. How's it taste?
4022	This tea is quite expensive, isn't it? I can kind of tell.
4023	Wow, this tea smells so fancy. Thank you.
4024	This tea is too expensive to waste on someone like\nme... But thank you...
4025	Wow, this tea looks pricey... I'd love some!
4026	What a fancy smell! This is a lot different from what\nI usually drink.
4027	Delightful. I see you appreciate the finer things.
4028	This smell... This...this tea is more subtle than the\nstandard fare.
4029	I'd know the scent of a premium tea any day.\nSmells heavenly, Professor.
4030	Oh, such a refined scent. Perfect! This is an\nexpensive tea, isn't it? Of course it is.
4031	This tea smells wonderful. It is a quite premium tea,\nis it not?
4032	Oh, this tea must be quite expensive. No need to pull\nout all the stops.
4033	That tea has gotta be expensive. Here, I'll just take\na little sip.
4034	You used premium tea leaves. Who are you trying\nto impress?
4035	Such a pretty color. I don't know much about tea.\nIs any of it expensive?
4036	
4037	You seem to have a refined taste for tea.\nI am looking forward to enjoying my cup.

4106	Do you honestly have nothing better to do? Well...\nI suppose I shouldn't chide you.
4107	Hm. You are looking for a weak spot, are you not?\nLook as long as you like. You will not find any.
4108	What's wrong? You look sleepy. Are you sleepy by \nany chance? Well, I am.
4109	I'm not good at staying still for too long. Maybe I can\nget some squats in...
4110	You know I don't like being around people, right?
4111	Has anyone ever told you that you're hard to read?
4112	This style of braiding has been passing...has been\npassed down through my family.
4113	Why are you staring?
4114	You're staring at me.
4115	What is it?
4116	Are you waiting for me to say something? 'Cause I\ngot nothing.
4117	Oh, was there something you were looking for?
4118	What are you thinking?
4119	Strength and stamina are necessary for fighting on\nhorseback. As is footwork!
4120	Haha.
4121	You wanna see my muscles?
4122	I wish I wasn't so shy all the time.
4123	Tea is nice and all, but it's not much good when you\ndon't have sweets to go with it.
4124	I'm not very good at this sort of thing...
4125	No boring lectures, OK?
4126	What are you staring at me for? I've been doing\nall my training.
4127	I am surprised you wanted to spend time with me.
4128	You look odd today. Are you feeling all right?
4129	You do seem to have a mark of the exceptional\nabout you.
4130	Your gaze is...sensuous. I don't hate it.
4131	You seem to have something to say. What is it?
4132	Something wrong?
4133	We should go out for drinks sometime! Your treat.
4134	It's quiet here. I like it.
4135	Do you find Almyrans interesting? I don't think \nwe're so different from anyone else.

4204	Your room is quite comfortable. I feel I could relax\nhere for a good while.
4205	Let's skip the chatter and just enjoy a moment\nof peace.
4206	I'm normally the one with the unsettling stare.
4207	Stare at me as long as you want. Provided I can stare\nback at you.
4208	Do I have drool on my face? I...think I just woke up.
4209	What's going on? You're staring at me like I did\nsomething wrong. I swear I'm innocent!
4210	I'm getting used to being here, but it's still a little\nweird for me.
4211	I've been told my eyes are like gemstones.\nWhat do you think?
4212	I am not having many changes to show off clothing\nof Brigid. It is regretful.
4213	I am not particularly interesting. I do not tell jokes\nor anything like that.
4214	Join me for training later. I want to try something.
4215	I was hoping we'd get a chance to talk today.
4216	Professor, you are... Is it rude to say you're a\nmysterious person? Because you are...mysterious.
4217	My mind can be so scattered sometimes.
4218	I'm at my happiest when I'm digging into\na sweet treat.
4219	Times are tough... All the more reason to take a\nbreather every now and then.
4220	It is refreshing to set aside my noble responsibilities,\neven if only for a moment.
4221	I was just training, so my muscles are bulging!
4222	I've really grown up.
4223	I don't like being stared at.
4224	You always watch out for me. It's very encouraging...
4225	It's nice to relax now and then.
4226	Sometimes I wish I had bigger muscles.
4227	I enjoy casual conversation, once in a while.
4228	Much time has passed, has it not?
4229	I understand the weather has been good of late.\nWord is it should remain so for some time.
4230	Oh, that sensual gaze of yours... Mmm, keep it up.
4231	It is not bad to take a break sometimes, though I \nseldom allow myself to do so.
4232	Know any good jokes?
4233	I get tense from fighting. It's nice to have some\ndowntime like this.
4234	I'm a bit tired. Forgive me if I fall asleep.
4235	I'm kinda taller then I used to be.

4305	Is my face really that interesting?
4306	Yes, I wear a hidden dagger on my belt. How astute\nof you to notice.
4307	I trim my eyebrows carefully every morning. A noble\nmust always be well-groomed.
4308	This hair band? Someone gave it to me, I think. Yet\nif that's the case, I've forgotten who.
4309	I know my arms aren't very long, but they sure\nare muscular!
4310	I try not to think about my hair too much.
4311	Everyone here is an heir or an heiress. But not me.\nI'm just a commoner.
4312	Do you have curiosity about my mark?
4313	Does my face unsettle you? I have heard it before.
4314	I dislike making eye contact when I'm talking. Even\nwhen I'm talking to you.
4315	I've been trying to build more muscle lately. I need\nto be stronger to keep up with everyone.
4316	Is something wrong with my face? A bruise on my \ncheek? Heh... Nah, Professor. Everything's fine.
4317	Oh! I'm so sorry. I was lost in thought.
4318	I'm thinking of changing my hair...
4319	What? Is there something on my face?
4320	If you like this hairstyle so much, perhaps you should\ntry it for yourself.
4321	If your muscles are hungry, you gotta feed 'em!
4322	Some people look smarter if they're wearing glasses.\nNot me though.
4323	My hair color is pretty unique, huh?
4324	I'm not very good at talking to people...
4325	Ugh... If you hear anything, it's not my stomach\ngrumbling. Just so you know.
4326	Captain Jeralt made this necklace for me a long\ntime ago. It's a reminder of where I came from.
4327	These hair and eye colors are rarely seen in F√≥dlan.
4328	It is a different style from everyone's uniforms, but I\ndo love the patterning on the hem.
4329	Something wrong with my monocle? It is a custom\nmade piece. Yet still problematic sometimes.
4330	Every rose has its thorn. Every beautiful leg should\nhave a dagger, don't you think?
4331	I have been training for decades and, not to brag,\nhave developed strong arms.
4332	Captain Jeralt once told me I didn't look dignified.\nThat's why I grew this beard!
4333	Why are you staring at my hair? My eyes are\ndown here. Heh!
4334	Admiring my gloves? I always wear them. I never\nknow when I'll have to handle a weapon.
4335	Only thing I still got from Almyra is this bit of cloth.\nIt's real tough.
4336	
4337	This crown is rather elaborate, but it has been passed\ndown through generations of archbishops.

4403	Do you like my hair? Actually, it used to be much\ndarker than this.
4404	My right eye? The scar is healed now. It narrows my\nsight a little, but it does not interfere with fighting.
4405	You really like looking at my face, don't you?\nI have no idea what you find so interesting.
4406	I hid my dagger in my sleeve today. You noticed\nit immediately, didn't you?
4407	I used to be told I did not know the meaning of\nhardship. Now I am a little more weathered.
4408	My skin is pale and very smooth. I've had more than \none girl get jealous.
4409	I grew a lot, haven't I? I'm pretty sure I'm taller than\nyou now!
4410	Aah, it's peaceful here...
4411	I wish you could've seen me when I was on stage,\nwearing jewels and silks every night.
4412	My hair is of a Brigid style. It is giving me joy that\nyou are liking it!
4413	I am often told that my face is frightening, especially\nwhen I smile.
4414	A swordsman treasures his hands. You knew that\nalready, I'm sure.
4415	I tried to grow a beard once. It was hairrible.\nHahaha...huh... Almost as bad as that joke...
4416	In a time like this, not a lot of people can keep their\nhands clean.
4417	I know it's a luxury, but I take my skin care\nvery seriously.
4418	I try to take good care of myself, so that I'm in top\nform when the it's time to act!
4419	I'm starting to enjoy the simplistic pleasure of\nmakeup, though it's a bit silly, if you ask me.
4420	Not too messy, is it? I styled it quite carefully before\nI came by.
4421	My chest is harder than armor! It can deflect\nany attack!
4422	There's still so much for me to paint with\nthese hands.
4423	If things had turned out differently, my hair wouldn't\nbe this color.
4424	Um, do you need something?
4425	Feeling a little bloated. Ate a huge meal earlier.\nNo regrets though, it was delicious.
4426	Captain Jeralt is always with me, here. I hope he's\nwatching over us.
4427	Our similar hair and eye colors are proof we share\ncommon ancestry.
4428	Ever since your hair shifted to look more like mine,\nI feel so much closer to you.
4429	You like how I have my beard trimmed? Thank you.\nI am quite particular about its shape.
4430	I see you're taken in by my beautiful skin. If you keep\nstaring like that, I might get the wrong idea.
4431	Even though I parted ways with the knights, my faith\nnever swayed.
4432	Some people say, "That's not a beard.\nThat's a goatee." I say, "Stop splitting hairs!" Hah!
4433	You know, I never wear makeup. Don't need to.
4434	I can feel you staring. Stop that.
4435	This scar? I think maybe somebody punched me...\nI don't really remember.
4436	
4437	If there is something you wish to say, I hope you\nknow that you may tell me anything.

4503	It upsets Hubert when I spend time alone with you.\nI'll refrain from telling him about this.
4504	Please join me for training when you have the time.\nThere is much I could learn from you.
4505	You're such a mystery.
4506	While I am quite busy, this is not a waste of my time.\nI'm grateful for the opportunity to observe you.
4507	You have a way of making people feel comfortable.\nI almost cannot help telling you everything.
4508	You are full of mysteries and yet offer no answers.\nHow unfair.
4509	Hey, are you getting hungry?
4510	My mother works in the Imperial capital. People\nthere say she's a genius.
4511	More nobles than you'd expect make a pilgrimage to\nGarreg Mach to pray.
4512	If you are having problems, I am happy to\nbe listening.
4513	Was there something you wanted to discuss?
4514	Crests, lineage, knighthood... Trifles. Skill and\nsurvival are the only things that matter.
4515	I still have a lot to learn. I need to work harder.
4516	Everyone has their own reason to fight. At least I'm\nhonest about mine.
4517	I baked a cake earlier today. Should I have brought\nsome with me?
4518	No effort is ever in vain... My father used to tell\nme that.
4519	As a child, my father and brother used to yell at me\nfor spending so much time with my horse.
4520	A noble's life is full of rigid expectation. I sometimes\nenvy the freedom of commoners.
4521	I gotta become a proper knight so I can take care of\nmy little sis!
4522	I wanna support my family, but I don't know if I can\nhandle being a knight.
4523	I know I could stand to lighten up from time to time.
4524	Spending time with me must be boring, isn't it?
4525	You know? I love hearing myself talk!
4526	Hope you've been keeping up with your training.\nIf you're not careful, I'll surpass you.
4527	I wonder why the archbishop is so interested in you.
4528	Lively places are my favorite. I like the monastery\nbecause there are always so many people\nbustling about.
4529	The "Ashen Demon." What an unbelievable title,\nknowing who you are now...
4530	There's no alcohol in here. It's better if you can sleep\nwithout it, but... All you have is tea?
4531	Walking first thing in the morning is a pleasant way\nto begin your day. Try it sometime.
4532	You don't look much like Captain Jeralt, but you\nremind me of him.
4533	I hear your nickname is "Ashen Demon." It's good,\nbut not as good as "Thunder Catherine."
4534	I'm not much for conversation. I'll gladly leave if\nyou're bored.
4535	Lady Rhea sure seems to like you, Professor. \nI don't know why...
4536

4603	If I hadn't been born to House Hresvelg, I imagine\nlife would have been much simpler.
4604	I cannot tell you how long it has been since\nI indulged in a nice, relaxing conversation...
4605	I want to know more about you.
4606	The head of House Vestra has always been a minister\nto the emperor.
4607	Since I was a child, I have loved riding horses\nand fighting. People used to tell me to act more\nlike a noble.
4608	Being surrounded by all these Crest-bearers makes\nme want to better understand Crestology.
4609	I'm gonna keep training until I can beat you!
4610	Please don't eavesdrop on my singing anymore, OK?
4611	I am not really a fan of hymns. I don't want to offer\nsilly songs to my goddess.
4612	The ocean is far from Garreg Mach... I am feeling\na bit lonely at times.
4613	I do not like classrooms. I would rather learn at my\nown pace.
4614	You intrigue me. What made you so strong?
4615	Have you ever seen a ghost? Probably for the best\nif you haven't...
4616	Opera, art, literature, I love 'em. They always give\nyou something to talk about.
4617	The cathedral is nice and quiet. It's so relaxing!
4618	The only way to clean is to clean with all your\nmight! Otherwise you're wasting your time!
4619	I'm already thinking of my next meal...
4620	The rose perfectly embodies the blend of elegance\nand power that I seek to possess.
4621	No one else comes close to having muscles like me,\nbut that's not good enough, is it?
4622	I think it's good to have a hobby. Some people say\nit's a waste of time, but I think it's nice.
4623	One of the few pleasures I find is in eating sweets.\nIt's...kind of embarrassing.
4624	I-I'm sorry... I don't know what to say...
4625	Have you ever cried, Professor? It's hard to imagine\nyou crying.
4626	I don't care what you think of me. I just don't want\nto lose to you.
4627	I do hope you will inform me of any issues you may\nencounter in the monastery.
4628	I desire to see the ocean again‚Äîit is difficult being so\nfar away from it.
4629	Since I have never found out the secret of your birth,\nI am exceptionally intrigued.
4630	Am I that terrible of a woman? So, I'm a little\nunkempt, what of it?
4631	I enjoy a bit of fishing. I hear you do as well?
4632	There's nothing worse than trying to explain a joke.
4633	I'm always watching you. I guess this is your way\nof returning the favor.
4634	Heh. You always have an interesting look on\nyour face.
4635	If I got kicked out of the monastery, I'd have no\nother place to go.
4636	
4637	Have confidence. I truly believe you can lead your\nstudents down the right path.

4705	Do you really have time for this? I know how\nbusy you are...
4706	Lady Edelgard has taken a liking to you. She will\nwant to hear all about this.
4707	You often hear stories of nobles and commoners\nin love. I am not against such things, but reality\nis not so simple. 
4708	Crest versus nurture. Which causes a noble's \npersonality disorder? There's a research project, eh?
4709	I just wanna go wild and let it all out! Come on,\nProfessor, send me out front in our next battle!
4710	I was worried you called me here to punish me for\nsomething. I'm glad I was wrong.
4711	My ideal partner is religious, but only just. And they\nhave enough money to live on for all our days.
4712	Next I will be studying, training, researching,\nsparring... I am having a lot to do!
4713	I am the sword and shield of His Highness. I must\nconstantly work to improve.
4714	I'm glad I was born into a family of soldiers. I've been\nwielding a sword for as long as I can remember.
4715	I'm good with children. I've taken care of my\nyounger siblings since I was a kid.
4716	You're always really stoic.
4717	I'm actually quite skilled at drawing. I wouldn't mind\nusing you as a model!
4718	Maybe I should have baked us a cake or something...
4719	It's warm around the monastery and the soil is rich...\nHonestly, I'm envious.
4720	Do not concern yourself with the rumors. It is not\npossible for a lady to find me irritating.
4721	Is there anything to eat, Professor? My stomach's\nsaying it's snack time!
4722	You're so young and so accomplished! I admire you.
4723	Do you believe in ghosts, Professor? Just wondering.
4724	It's a waste to spend your time with me...
4725	You don't say much, so you're easy to talk to.
4726	Don't throw away anything that's still usable, OK?\nI'll take whatever you don't need.
4727	I know I speak harshly at times, but I hope you\nunderstand that I am merely doing my job.
4728	You are an interesting person, Professor. You do not\nseem to know much about yourself.
4729	Why don't you come by later? I'd very much like to\ndive into some research together.
4730	Who are you really? Such a mystery. I don't really\nunderstand you... Tell me everything.
4731	Spear, sword, archery, martial arts, soldiery... I \nbelieve I've mastered most things worth mastering.
4732	Ghosts, sailing, spicy foods... These are the fears I\nhave yet to conquer.
4733	You know war strategy, not just how to wield\na sword. Maybe I should study that too.
4734	The Sword of the Creator... It's an interesting Relic.
4735	I like working. Feels real good to be needed.
4736	
4737	I sense great potential in you. You possess\nsomething extraordinary...

4803	A moment of relaxation... It has been a while.\nI find spending these quiet moments with you\nrather comforting.
4804	Perhaps because of my strength, I have always been\nrather clumsy. I always end up breaking things that\nare precious...
4805	I feel like we've known each other for a while,\nand yet, I'm still fascinated by you.
4806	Most who spend time around me seem to become\nbored and depressed. Heh. Can't imagine why.
4807	When I am unhappy, I try to bestow happiness\nupon others. Such is the way of the true noble.
4808	I always feel as if I cannot keep up with other people.\nEveryone else seems to have a destination in mind.
4809	I usually don't get hung up on things, but when I do,\nI feel stuck!
4810	If two people decide to be recluses together...does\nthat even still count?
4811	So, you don't have any weaknesses after all?\nI'm totally envious of you.
4812	You are working with much...diligence.\nI am admiring of you.
4813	Should I have brought sweets?
4814	I know it's important to take a break, but if you rest\ntoo long, your muscles wither.
4815	It's nice in here. I feel like I can relax.
4816	I was thinking I should do some proper training \nsometime. Care to join me, Professor?
4817	I baked a cake earlier today. Should I have brought\nsome with me?
4818	I feel so at ease here! I really like spending time\nwith you.
4819	Being here calms my nerves... Oh! But I'll leave if\nI'm in your way.
4820	Even a noble needs a break now and then. One\ncannot be at one's best all the time.
4821	I can't miss a single lecture if I wanna become a\nproper knight!
4822	I'm realizing that I can learn a lot from you.
4823	If I hadn't met you, I don't think I'd be who I\nam today.
4824	You'll be met with misfortune if you spend too much\ntime with me...
4825	My mind keeps drifting today...
4826	Back home, I always trained alone. No one else in my\nvillage wanted to be a mercenary.
4827	You have become very special to us.
4828	Have you any idea how many types of fish there are?\nIt is unthinkable‚Äîtheir different sizes, shapes,\ncolors... I find it fascinating!
4829	The Crest of Flames shares many traits with other\nCrests. Yet, it also has many unique characteristics.
4830	What should I do to find love, Professor? I don't\nwant to spend my days alone. 
4831	I've served the royal family for decades, and marched\nthrough history by their side.
4832	You should go fishing with me soon! The other day,\nI almost caught one.
4833	I'm not going to hurt you. No need to look\nso nervous.
4834	As far as mercenaries go, I'd say I work for a\nfair price.
4835	If there's anything 'bout Lady Rhea you wanna know,\nI can probably tell ya.
4836	
4837	You are truly special. It seems that I was right\nabout you.

4903	Do you remember the day we met? You protected\nme from those bandits.
4904	When I feel down, I go out for a long ride on\nmy own. There is no place more relaxing than\na trusted steed's back.
4905	You're not like the others. You're an outsider,\njust like me.
4906	Sometimes your insights are so keen they seem to\nborder on precognition.
4907	You treat everyone the same, regardless of status.\nPerhaps I should do that as well.
4908	Please wake me if I fall asleep. I don't wish to be a\nrude guest.
4909	What is justice really? I'm not so sure\nI know anymore...
4910	I like to hide out in the greenhouse, but I always\nhave to leave eventually. No place to sleep.
4911	You're such an open-minded person, Professor. I'm \nglad you don't judge me for living how I want to.
4912	You are not remembering where your homeland is?\nI am thinking that is strange...
4913	This life was given to me by His Highness. I do not\nintend to give it to anyone else.
4914	Some people like to snack when they take a break.\nNo willpower.
4915	The years I had with Lonato...those were some of the\nbest of my life.
4916	Sometimes, I'm surprised how warm the monastery \nis. I wish my parents' home was like this.
4917	I used to live in a quiet and beautiful church...but it's\nnot bad here either!
4918	I remember the first time I met you. Right away,\nit was like talking to an old friend.
4919	I wonder what your favorite food is. Meat? Veggies?\nFish, perhaps? Oh, or maybe sweets...
4920	I am not mindlessly following my father. When it\nis time to make a choice, I decide what I will do.
4921	My grandpa used to be real strong when he was\nyounger. I obviously take after the guy!
4922	I don't know what I can do, but I'm prepared to\nassume responsibility for my future.
4923	It's not in me to put energy into things that won't\nyield results. I just don't see the point.
4924	You don't seem to be very good at talking... At least\nyou're not as bad as me.
4925	No matter what happens in this crazy world, I know\nI'll be safe if I stay by your side.
4926	I'm proud to be the greatest apprentice to the best\nmercenary in F√≥dlan. That keeps me going.
4927	The more you learn about yourself, the more paths\nwill become open to you.
4928	Whenever I look at you, a wave of nostalgia washes\nover me. I wonder why that is.
4929	It was my own choice to leave behind my noble title\nand holdings. I'll not be going back.
4930	You think I complain too much, don't you?\nI know I do, but I can't help it.
4931	I am an unforgivable sinner. I do not deserve \na peaceful life.
4932	Don't forget, if you ever need anything, just let\nme know.
4933	I'm a little restless. I don't much care for\nwaiting around.
4934	I enjoy a lack of conversation. But how are you?
4935	I'm the best at cleaning. I never miss any smudge or \nspot or dirt or grime or even...filth.
4936	
4937	I would like you to be a pillar of support for the\nChurch in order to keep peace in F√≥dlan.

5003	You're always so calm.
5004	I do my training, and then care for my swords\nand spears...and then the day is over before\nI know it.
5005	There are too many mysteries in this world. I wonder\nhow many we can solve in our lifetime...
5006	House Vestra is one of few noble houses not to lay\nclaim to any territory.
5007	I am extremely versatile. In fact, I fear I am a\njack-of-all-trades.
5008	They say the Crest's power dwells in blood. So why\ndoes it have to be so disgusting?
5009	Who was that guy? You don't know who I'm talking\nabout? The suspicious guy who killed himself!
5010	It's relaxing here! Should've brought my sewing kit.
5011	Why are men so vain? They should know their lies\nwill never last.
5012	One day I am wanting to show you the wonderful\nland of Brigid and its abundant nature.
5013	The flowers in the greenhouse are in bloom.\nYou should have a look later.
5014	Spending time with you is...not bad.
5015	I'm confident in my speed. No one can outrun me!
5016	Somebody gave me some candy earlier. I should have\nbrought some with me.
5017	I should probably write to my mother soon...
5018	I broke a plate again the other day... I wish I could\nbe as calm and graceful as you are.
5019	When did you start sword training? I was five when\nI began...
5020	You are quite an intriguing person. I would be lying\nif I said I did not find you fascinating.
5021	You're pretty strong for being so shrimpy. You'd be\nunstoppable if you put on some muscle!
5022	With you and all the friends I've made, I'm glad I\ncame here.
5023	Talking to you feels worth my time. I feel there's a\nlot I can learn from you.
5024	It's not like I can go home... My adoptive father\ndoesn't want me there...
5025	Everyone's so serious all the time. Boooooring.
5026	I feel bad acting out so much around you. Seems like\nI just can't help it.
5027	If there is anything I can do for you, please tell me.
5028	I have a fear of sleeping. I worry that I will awake,\nand everyone I know and love will have vanished.
5029	The monastery holds so many documents in its\nlibrary, yet certain facts continue to elude me.
5030	Sometimes I think back to when I used to shine as\na songstress.
5031	No judge, not even the goddess herself, will bring\nme to justice. Though I deserve it.
5032	I've been prattling on and on about myself. How are\nyou today?
5033	You look calm, as usual. I wonder what you look like\nwhen you're nervous.
5034	I look forward to the next battle. They seem to go\nsmoothly under your command.
5035	Even if the goddess really does exist, I wonder if\nshe'd protect Almyrans...
5036	
5037	Being the Archbishop can be lonely, no matter\nhow many followers surrounded you...

5103	One day, I'll show you around the palace in Enbarr.\nIt has a lovely garden.
5104	You really helped me. More than I can say.\nIf it weren't for you, I do not know where I\nwould be now...
5105	I'll take you to my hometown one day. There are\nsome truly tasty dishes you can't find in F√≥dlan.
5106	As a humble servant to Her Majesty, I sometimes\nenvy the status she has given you.
5107	I suppose the Sword of the Creator never goes dull,\nso you do not need to sharpen it.
5108	If I don't become a scholar then perhaps librarian is \nthe job for me.
5109	They say hard work pays off, but I don't think that's\nalways true. Either way, I'm gonna keep trying!
5110	You're spoiling me. I don't want to go out on my\nown anymore.
5111	Don't you think you feel stronger attraction to\nsomeone when you know you may die tomorrow?
5112	It gives me great pleasure to be speaking with you\nlike this.
5113	I feel comfortable here.
5114	Join me for sword training again. I want to know my\nvictory isn't a fluke.
5115	I get letters from my brother and sister every once in\na while. They have it tough, but they're getting by.
5116	I feel like you can see right through me.
5117	You should really brighten this room up a bit. Have\nyou considered putting flowers in the window?
5118	There's an equation I've been thinking about...\nCan you help me with it later?
5119	When I'm here, I feel like I can forget about fighting,\neven if just for a moment.
5120	Being here helps soothe the heartache from all the\nbloodshed of this war.
5121	Wanna train together? I can show you some new\ntechniques I thought up!
5122	Thank you for letting me continue with my art.\nI'll do my part on the battlefield.
5123	I wonder what I'd do, who I'd be, if I gave everything\nup for freedom. I think about that all the time.
5124	Thanks to you, I'm beginning to feel more\ncomfortable talking to people.
5125	We should go on a trip together someday, when\nit's peaceful.
5126	I'll always be here for you. Just like I promised\nCaptain Jeralt.
5127	When my own thoughts grow tiresome, I go fishing.\nYou should join me sometime.
5128	I was born in Enbarr, though I have lived in remote\nlands far away, at times...
5129	All of my hard work, my unrelenting study of Crests,\nis all in the name of my sister, rest her soul.
5130	I must thank you for spending so much time with\nme. Your company helps me keep sane.
5131	It's true that strength alone will not make you\npowerful. Yet you will not become powerful\nwithout it.
5132	The other night, I felt a ghostly presence in my bed.\nI leapt to my feet, but...no one was there.
5133	I have zero desire to go back to Faerghus. Can you\nimagine me as a noble?
5134	I apologize for what I said before. It was tactless to\ncompare you to memories from my past.
5135	I think you're an amazing person, Professor. I mean,\nLady Rhea is still the best, but I like ya well enough.
5136	
5137	I, too, like to spread my wings from time to time.\nDoing so in your company is a treat.

5203	Here I can take a break from the burden of being\nemperor. Perhaps that's why I'm so comfortable\nwith you.
5204	I would invite you to my quarters next, but I fear\nmy space is so bare it is almost laughable.
5205	By the way, they've discovered a new kind of poison\nmushroom. When you eat it, your body exudes a\nmysterious steam! Um, or so I hear...
5206	For choosing to walk this path with Her Majesty,\nyou have my eternal gratitude.
5207	You will always remember me, will you not?
5208	You bear the legendary Crest of Flames. You simply\nmust allow me to study it‚Äîplease, Professor.
5209	I really love fighting alongside you. I can always\ncount on your commands to get us through!
5210	My room at the monastery is my home away from\nhome, but this is cozy too.
5211	So many people have died... I'm so terribly down.\nI feel better here, with you though.
5212	In Enbarr, I was a hostage. I was spending much\ntime locked away. Books gave me great comfort.
5213	Next time, you should visit me. I will prepare tea\nand cake.
5214	I'm always thinking about wars, but this room feels\nso peaceful.
5215	Time flies when I'm with you.
5216	I'm in a bit of trouble with a girl right now.\nAlthough, I can't think of a time when that hasn't\nbeen the case.
5217	As I continue to grow, I've learned not to regret the\nchoices I've made!
5218	The confectioner is back in town! Would you like to\ngo with me sometime?
5219	Would you like to have a meal with me? Though...it\nwasn't long ago that I ate.
5220	I cannot yet speak to you as an equal. Not when\nthere is still so much left to learn.
5221	I wouldn't have come here if my parents were still\nalive. That means I never woulda met you!
5222	Oh, don't mind me. I was just admiring you.
5223	If not for Crests, the world might've been a more\npeaceful place.
5224	I'm all right now. I think I can look forward to living\nmy life.
5225	Your room's so neat! You should clean mine too.
5226	Don't worry about what I owe to my village. I don't\nlive this frugally for nothing.
5227	Whatever happens, know I am proud to support you.
5228	You and I are of a rare breed. We should take care of\neach other.
5229	I never can stop talking about Crests, can I?\nDon't you dare laugh at me.
5230	Your room is so nice and clean. How do you keep\nit like this?
5231	The Holy Kingdom of Faerghus is the nation of \nproud knights. I love that country...\nand miss it deeply.
5232	I'm your big brother Alois! You can ask me anything\nyou want.
5233	We should train together.
5234	This room... It suits you.
5235	I'm real busy all the time, but talking with you like\nthis gets me excited to do more!
5236	
5237	I do not have a friend whom I can fully trust. Such is\nthe burden of my position...

5303	I have no intention of handing the Imperial throne\nover to any child I might have. Instead, I'll choose\nan outsider who's brilliant and kind.
5304	These last five years, I have been many places,\nand I have seen many things.
5305	You've become quite expressive, haven't you?\nYou weren't like that when we first met.
5306	Sometimes I like to imagine that you were sent to us\nby a rival of the goddess to bring her low.
5307	Hmm. It can be good to relax now and then.\nShall we play a game?
5308	We should explore ways to utilize the power of\nRelics and Crests for something other than combat.
5309	I'm always gonna do things my way. If there's a wall\nblocking my path, I'll punch a hole right through it!
5310	The room feels a little...empty. Needs more cuteness.
5311	Whatever the future may bring, I'm so glad\nI met you.
5312	I am requiring much sleep to be staying alert.\nAt least a quarter of each day.
5313	Long ago, I once held a grudge against the blood\nof Duscur. Now, I... Well, it is not important.
5314	Well...I appreciate all that you do for me.
5315	A lot's happened, but none of it's been in vain.\nThat's what I believe.
5316	You are really curious, aren't you? Eh, I'm glad \nyou're like that.
5317	Not to be a bother, but do you mind if I stay just a\nlittle longer?
5318	When I'm with you...I feel like I can be myself.
5319	Speaking with you helps me realize I can't hesitate\nin life!
5320	I hope it is not untoward of me to ask, but...might\nI stay a little longer?
5321	You seem tired, Professor. The best cure for\nsleepiness is sleep!
5322	I need to keep training. I know a brush and canvas\naren't enough to protect you.
5323	I'm exhausted by all my incessant thoughts. I just\nwant to empty my mind for now.
5324	I hope you never leave...oh! Never mind...\nIgnore me.
5325	I wish I could stay here and chat all day. Time to go\nback to the real world though.
5326	People always seem to be talking about romance,\nbut...honestly, I'm just not interested in that stuff.
5327	I put up a stiff front with people, due to my position.\nBut that's not really me.
5328	Even if I fall asleep, please do not leave my side.\nPromise you will stay near.
5329	Can't be helped. I'll tell you about my favorite food\nagain. Or perhaps we should talk about drinks?
5330	You are always so kind to me, Professor. I love it,\nbut that, too, is its own vice, isn't it?
5331	I am sorry, but relaxing is...not a skill I possess.
5332	When the war's over, I can finally go home to my\nwife and daughter...
5333	You and I both have sword Relics. We should spar\nwith them soon.
5334	Dagda is far. It would take months to travel there\nby foot...
5335	I'm getting sleepy... Busy day and all.
5336	
5337	You are the only person I can talk to as myself,\nrather than as the Archbishop.

5405	Ah, I'm afraid I've stayed too long. Thanks for\nthe tea! Let's plan to do this again sometime.
5406	Thank you. This was more enjoyable than I thought.
5407	Thank you for spending time with me. What a treat.\nI hope we can do this again soon.
5408	That was delicious. It feels good to relax. Well, I'm\noff to catch a nap...
5409	Thanks for this, Professor! Don't you want to get\nsome exercise though? Come on, let's go train!
5410	This was great!
5411	That was a lovely cup of tea. Thank you, Professor.\nPlease call me again.
5412	I will be waiting happily for you to be inviting\nme again.
5413	It was delicious. I hope you will invite me again.
5414	Thanks for your hospitality. I hope you'll invite me\nagain sometime.
5415	Thanks for the tea. I hope we can do this again.
5416	Thank you for the treat, Professor. I'd like to do this \nagain sometime.

5905	A lost item? Sorry, but that's not mine.\nI have no idea whose it is, either.
5906	Unfortunately, you are mistaken. This does not\nbelong to me.
5907	How could you possibly think that is mine? Go ask\nsomeone else.
5908	That's not mine. Hmm... I wonder who it does \nbelong to...
5909	What's this? Nah, it's not mine. You should ask\nsomeone else.
5910	Um... Why did you think this was mine?
5911	I'm sorry but that's not mine. I wonder whose it is?
5912	This is not belonging to me. I hope you are finding\nits owner soon.
5913	That is not mine. Try asking others.
5914	I know nothing about it. Ask someone else.
5915	Hmm. This isn't mine. You should ask around.
5916	Um, sorry, but this isn't mine.
5917	Did you find this? I wonder who it belongs to...
5918	A lost item... Hmm. I haven't seen it before. Maybe\nyou should ask around.
5919	No, that's not mine... I suggest you ask around.
5920	Hmm, I don't recall misplacing anything. You will\nhave to excuse me‚ÄîI am quite busy.
5921	That isn't mine. I have no clue who coulda\ndropped it.
5922	Someone lost that, huh? I don't know whose it is,\nI'm afraid.
5923	What? Did someone lose that? It's not mine.
5924	What's this? Oh, no. That's not mine...
5925	Never seen that thing before in my life. Good luck\nfinding the owner.
5926	Someone lost this? Some people just don't appreciate\nwhat they have.
5927	I'm sorry to say I have no idea to whom this belongs.
5928	Hm, I wonder who this belongs to. I have not the\nfaintest idea.
5929	I'm not sure why you'd imagine I might own such a\nthing. Try someone else.
5930	No, that's not mine. I hope you find the owner.
5931	No, that does not belong to me.\nI suggest you speak to others.
5932	Hm, not mine. Try someone else.
5933	Huh. Not mine. Don't know whose it is.
5934	It's not mine. You should ask someone else.
5935	I don't know who this belongs to, but it's not mine.

6008	Something interesting for once.
6009	Feels like me.
6010	Will this suit me?
6011	I don't look odd or anything, do I?
6012	A new feeling... I will learn again.
6013	I will do what must be done.
6014	Ah, a new way to fight.
6015	I'm eager to learn so much more.
6016	Well? How do I look?
6017	I'll put my best foot forward.
6018	I'll make this role my own.
6019	Back to the drawing board.
6020	One must not fear a challenge.
6021	I'm gonna give it my all.
6022	Am I cut out for this?
6023	How...conspicuous.
6024	I hope I can handle this.
6025	Haha! This might be interesting...
6026	Another chance to improve.
6027	I must set course for a new horizon.
6028	I am always up for a new adventure!
6029	This could benefit my research.
6030	I can reinvent as often as necessary.
6031	Perhaps I should have faith in myself.
6032	I hope my captain would approve.
6033	I never turn down a challenge.
6034	A new way to fight.
6035	Hope I'm cut out for this.
6036	Perhaps this is fitting.
6037	So be it.
6038	It suits me well.

6102	A new path to tread.
6103	I must grow into this new role.
6104	This suits me well.
6105	It's good to try new things.
6106	I welcome a change of pace.
6107	Hm, curious new strength.
6108	Another day, another outfit.
6109	All kindsa ways to get strong!
6110	Hmm... I don't feel any different.
6111	A balance of brawn and beauty.
6112	F√≥dlan garb is not usual...
6113	Hm, something new.
6114	I can work with this.
6115	Mastering this can only make me stronger.
6116	Let's see what I can do with this.
6117	I love a new challenge.
6118	I think I can work with this.
6119	I swear not to squander this power!
6120	This is suited to my talents.
6121	Hoho, this'll be fun.
6122	Oh, this is exciting.
6123	It's worth trying out.
6124	I guess I'll try it.
6125	What do you think? Is this me?
6126	This suits me.
6127	My interest is piqued.
6128	How joyous!
6129	Life is comprised of new challenges.
6130	I feel reinvigorated.
6131	No matter the road, I'll see it through.
6132	A new challenge to tackle.
6133	This will make me even stronger.
6134	More weapons.
6135	Guess I'll try it...
6136	I can fight under any conditions.
6137	This should prove amusing.

6206	Heh, this suits me well.
6207	Gaze upon this splendid finery!
6208	I wonder if I can sleep in this.
6209	Can't wait to try this out.
6210	Oh, fine. If it helps.
6211	Guess I'll have to learn something new, won't I?
6212	This is a way for getting more power.
6213	I will give it my all.
6214	How far can I take this?
6215	Mm, yeah, this will work.
6216	Strange, but...I like it.
6217	I'll do my best...
6218	How do you like the new me?
6219	Will this help me grow stronger?
6220	I am a sight to behold.
6221	Whatever it takes.
6222	I'll do my best...
6223	I can make it work.
6224	This might be OK.
6225	I'd better tell my brother about this.
6226	I'll need to make some adjustments.
6227	If it benefits the cause, so be it.
6228	Are these garments in style?
6229	I should have no trouble with this.
6230	I'm sure I'll master this as well.
6231	Will this lead me somewhere new?
6232	This could be interesting.
6233	Whatever the goddess ordains.
6234	I'll figure this out.

3	When one professor lectures many students, some will\ninevitably have trouble keeping up, while others will get\ntoo far ahead in their studies. I wonder how this problem\nmight be solved...
4	No matter the weapon, it cannot be wielded properly\nwithout ample strength and stamina, regardless of the\nskills one may possess. I've been using various training\ntechniques, but lately I feel like they all are lacking...
5	That was a fascinating lecture, but now my brain is fried.\nI feel like I need a change of pace to reinvigorate me.\nWhat do you recommend?
6	Such interesting ideas you seem to have, Professor, but tell\nme this: what would you do if you were given the task of\nteaching a subject that you yourself did not understand?
7	I am an avid arms collector. Since coming to live here,\nhowever, I have had much more trouble finding new items\nfor my collection. Any ideas as to where I might find some\nuncommon weapons?
8	When I take a lecture I'm not interested in,\nI get so...sleepy. I just can't fight it.\nI should just give up, don't you think? \nClose my eyes and enjoy a peaceful slumber?
9	Pretty soon I'll have eaten everything they have to offer\nin the dining hall. Then what am I supposed to do?\nKeep eating the same boring meals over and over again?
10	Um. Sorry, but you should probably just skip me. I don't\nhave a question to ask. How would I even think of one?
11	You know how sometimes an ordinary girl can be more\npopular than an exceptional beauty? Or how, with\naristocrats, some prefer a viscount when they could\nhave a duke instead? Why do you think that is?
12	I am having a question. I wish for improvement of my\nlance skills. But I am having uncertainty about how to\nbe training effectively. What should I be doing?
13	Though I have served His Highness for four years, he has\neluded my every attempt to learn his favorite foods.
14	Magic is not my forte. Being a gifted swordsman, I think\nmy time is best served practicing swordplay technique.\nWhy should I waste my time attending lectures, just to\nimprove my magic skills from mediocre to average?
15	I'm...kind of terrified to walk the monastery grounds at\nnight. It's unnerving how dark and quiet the place gets!\nHow can I conquer my fear?
16	I've been trying to win the heart of this girl,\nbut none of the fancy gifts or sweet things I tell\nher have worked. Do you know any secret dating\ntricks I can use to win her heart?
17	I enjoy a good ghost story, but I've never seen a ghost in\nreal life. I would love to have that experience for myself,\neven just once!
18	Lectures about strategy or reason require so much focus,\nI end up absolutely famished! But if I go to class after a\nbig meal, I can't help getting sleepy...
19	Art has never been my forte. Even when I apply myself and\nsketch a ton, I don't seem to improve much. I can envision\nan image so perfectly in my head, but turning it into\nsomething physical that I feel good about eludes me...
20	The ladies have been giving me the cold shoulder, of late.\nI believe it is because they are intimidated by my\nnoble presence. How can I be more...accessible?
21	I just wanna eat meat and fish, but everyone in the dining\nhall says I gotta eat vegetables too! I'm never gonna get full\non some stupid leaves!
22	I'm not very good at sharing my opinion. Usually, I just go\nalong with what everybody else thinks. I don't want to\nbother anyone. Um...
23	There's so much to do and never enough time in which to\ndo it. Sleep is a nuisance, but my body forces me to slow\ndown, even though my mind doesn't want to. Do you have\nany tips for shaking tired feelings away?
24	Um, excuse me... Can you help me? I always get the\nfeeling that I'm being watched. I get so nervous that I can't\nsleep at night...
25	I hate cleaning my room. It's so boring, and to be honest,\nI'm kinda lazy. But I don't want my room to get messy.\nWho do you think I should get to tidy up for me?
26	I don't care about being pretty or anything, but it bothers\nme that some people don't even realize I'm a girl.
27	I am staggered by how routinely the students seem to\nneglect their studies in favor of petty romance.\nYou should get this under control.
28	I want to be able to talk to males and make friends with\nthem, but my brother always causes such a fuss when I do.\nDo you have any advice for me?
29	When I ask them to take part in my experiments,\neven the most industrious students run away from me.\nNo matter how sincerely I plead!\nDo you have any suggestions?
30	Hey. Maybe you can answer a question I've had for a\nwhile now... Why is it that men don't like women who\nare messy?!
31	For the purpose of educating young aristocrats, the church\nborrows a number of soldiers from each country.\nAs these soldiers from different origins gather in one place,\nanimosity and fighting become frequent. It is...a problem.
32	As a member of the knights, I sometimes travel by ship for\nmy missions. But I have a bit of a weak stomach...\nWhat can I do to tamp down my sea sickness?
33	One of your students keeps challenging me to fight him,\nbut he has no idea how to wield a sword. It's a waste of\ntime for both of us. What am I supposed to do?
34	Some people hate spiders or centipedes, but they have no\nstrong feelings toward flies or crickets. Why is that?
35	I'm real happy here, but there's somebody who has\nup and decided to take pity on me. Without asking!\nIt's real darn irritating, and I want them to know it.\nI just don't know how I can make myself understood.

1	You should speak with every student you can. This might\nbe your only chance to see what they're really like before\nyou become a professor...
2	They need help taking care of the horses. And more help \nover at the fishing spot too. I'm helping out, but I have to\ndo my work for Lady Rhea first... Do ya think any of\nyour students would help out?
3	Professor, I do not mean to impose, but I wonder if you\nwould be willing to give me a little extra instruction?
4	Professor, I have a favor to ask. If you can spare the time,\nwould you be willing to provide some private instruction?
5	Hey, Teach. Mind spending some extra time with me?\nI could use a little more instruction.
6	I cannot believe how poorly maintained the saint statues\nare. Just look at them... Clutter at their feet as though that\nis even remotely acceptable!
7	Horses won't get any stronger just by eating. A lot more\ngoes into raising 'em right. Stop by the stables and you'll\nsee what I'm talking about.
8	I'm fresh out of recipe ideas. Say... Perhaps you could find\nsome for me. Maybe a student or the library's cookbooks\ncan spark some inspiration. Let me know, will you?
9	I've been thinking about starting a choir, and I need a\nvolunteer who can help me get it off the ground.\nCan you help me find some students who love music?
10	There is a ceremony related to Saint Cethleann that\nrequires rare fish. Would you mind helping me obtain\nsome, Professor? You can fish by speaking with the\nfishkeeper at the fishing pond.
11	There is a dish I would like to make, but I need more of a\ncertain vegetable to do so. I was planning to grow it from\nseeds in the greenhouse, but if you'd like to help...
12	If I have to eat in that filthy dining hall, I prefer to invite\na cute girl to dine with me. Beforehand, I'll find out her \nfavorite foods so I can order them. She's happy, I'm happy.\nI haven't missed a move! Pretty great, huh?
13	Merchants buy and sell all manner of items, but I'm only\ninterested in their works of art. Good art is like a balm for\nthe soul. Please do let me know if you get your hands\non any, Professor!
14	Hey. It seems I've lost something. When you have\na minute, can you help me look for it?
15	New knights have arrived to sell us their services, but their\nintegrity is questionable. It would be appreciated if you'd\nsee whether any are unfit to associate with the monastery.
16	Do you know about the fighting tournaments here at the\nmonastery? I hear anyone can get involved! Oh, I know!\nYou and I should sign up, Professor!
17	I made a dreadful mistake and ended up with two of the\nsame tea set. Now I must gift one of them to someone\nwho can appreciate its value. Could you help me find\nsomeone deserving of such a precious gift?
18	I won't tell you where exactly, but I came from a faraway\nplace to study here. I think we could both benefit from\nlearning more about each other. Don't you agree?
19	I'm running low on supplies. Soon, I won't have anything\nleft for forging weapons or making repairs. Sorry to bother\nyou with this, but can you fetch some materials for me?
20	I have been collecting my favorite composer's musical \nscores, but I've misplaced some of them somewhere in\nthe monastery. Would you help me look?
21	Did you know that students and professors alike need to\nbe certified for each type of soldier they lead? If you want\nto be certified for a new type of soldier, you'll need to take\na Certification Exam.
22	As a teacher, one should always be aware of one's students'\nsituation in life. Yes? The best way to do so, in my \nopinion, is to speak directly to the student. In order to \nliven up your conversation, prepare a gift for them.
23	There is solitude on the battlefield...but there are limits\nto what one can achieve alone. To be stronger,\nmore efficient...visit the battalion guild.
24	Jeralt is looking for you. I last saw him near his quarters,\nbut if he is not there, simply ask around.
25	The White Heron Cup is a competition of skill and grace\nin dance. Please encourage your house to participate.\nThat said, if you are serious about winning, be sure to\nchoose your representative carefully.
26	It's extremely important that professors tend to their own\nstudies as well. If you agree, I'd be more than happy to\nshare my knowledge.
27	A real battle this month, huh? I hear even the Knights of\nSeiros are involved. I never taught you much about tactics,\nbut there's a primer on it in my room. Give it a read.
28	Those who struggle with private concerns will sometimes\nvisit the cathedral for guidance. If you have the time,\nwhy not offer your keen insight, Professor?

41	It is not always easy to adjust to life here at the monastery.\nI am sure the transition has been less than comfortable for\nsome of your students. Perhaps you can help them.
42	The Western Church, which rules over the western parts\nof F√≥dlan, has lately made some strange troop movements.\nIf you hear anything concerning, be sure to let me know.
43	If we only knew the enemy's true aim, we might have\nsomething to work with. Let's look around the monastery\nand see if we can learn any new information.
44	We need to know the enemy's motive so we can adapt.\nLet's talk to people around the monastery and see if we\ncan learn anything that might lead us to a clue.
45	If I'm going to figure out what the enemy's after, I'll need\nmore to go on. Keep an ear to the ground around the\nmonastery for me. See what you can dig up.
46	A band of thieves has been raiding villages in the north of\nFaerghus. Reports indicate they have made an old tower\ntheir stronghold. Do you have any idea where it might be?
47	If we fail to locate Flayn soon, it will be too late.\nLet's assume she's been abducted, and start gathering\nwhat information we can about suspicious individuals.
48	Welcome to the fishing tournament. If you catch the\ntype of fish that Flayn asks for, you might win a prize.\nParticipate if you want. It's really not my concern.
49	Do you have that thing, Professor? If you find it, let me\nknow. Oh, and I can't stress this enough: Give it to ME,\nnot Shamir. Got it?
50	Just between us...many students have disappeared recently.\nIf you happen to learn anything pertinent, please inform\nme quickly and discreetly.
51	We have been scouting the makeup of the Imperial army,\nbut much is still unclear. Any information you could\nprovide would be a great help.
52	We must locate Flayn, and soon. Let's gather all of the\ninformation we can around the monastery. Surely someone\nmust have seen or heard something.
53	I wish we could do more for Flayn, but since we've got no\nleads, our only option is to search the monastery with\na fine-tooth comb. Someone must know something.
54	Do you have that thing? If you find it, give it to me.\nNot Catherine. Understood?

71	I poured my heart out into this letter... I'd like you to\ndeliver it for me. To whom, you ask? Well, he's always\nworking his hardest, and he's not very up-front with his\ntrue feelings, but he's got an adorable way about him...
72	Would you mind delivering this love letter on my behalf?\nTo whom, you ask? Well, he's gallant, he has a\ncharming smile, and he always puts his family first.
73	I know it's inappropriate to write love letters to someone\nin her position, but I can't help the way I feel. It may only\ninconvenience her, but...could you deliver this?
74	Um. One of Dorte's...friends...is about to have a baby.\nDo you know of any medicinal herbs that will ensure\na safe delivery?
75	I'm fond of wood carving, but I lack the talent for it. I hear\nthat those to the west of F√≥dlan have mastered woodwork.\nI'd like to learn their techniques.
76	Ashe said that he'd like some more chivalric legends in\nthe library, but I'm having trouble finding any. I wonder if\nyou could acquire a book like that through trading?
77	Linhardt asked for more books on magic in the library,\nbut I can't find anything. Could you try to acquire a magic\nbook through trading?
78	Dedue asked us to add more books about gardening to the\nlibrary's collection, but I have no idea where to find any.\nProfessor, perhaps you could get one by trading for it?
79	Instructing your students should always be your foremost\npriority, but that does not mean you can grow complacent.\nYou must keep up with your own training as well.
80	You know what I remember most about Remire, after all\nthis time? Those famous oranges. That's what sticks.\nWhat I wouldn't give for a Remire orange right now...
81	Would you assist us in securing more resources?
82	Professor, might I ask you to help us secure resources?
83	We're in dire need of some more supplies. Can you help?
84	We are working to acquire more resources, and would\ngreatly appreciate your help.
85	Whenever I think about the next battle, my knees won't\nstop shaking. I'm scared of getting hurt, or worse...\nIs there a medicinal herb I can use to calm my nerves?
86	The fish seem skittish lately... It's said that every five years,\nin the wake of a storm, a mystery fish appears and eats up\nall of the other fish in the pond. They call it the Big One.\nI thought that was just a legend, though.
87	Trade among merchants has boomed since we annexed\nthe Alliance territories. That is all well and good, but we\nshould not leave them defenseless, lest disaster strike.
88	It seems that, despite the danger, the merchant traffic\ncontinues to increase. We should take action,\nbefore there is an incident.
89	There's a lot more merchant activity lately, isn't there?\nThis area's still pretty unsafe, though. We should do\nsomething about it, before something bad happens.
90	It seems that the knights' presence has been encouraging\nto the merchants. It is good that the market is active,\nbut we should make certain that the area is safe for trade.
91	Some bandits are making trouble in a nearby village.\nNormally we would assist, but right now we have our\nhands full with this Lord Lonato business. So many\nto help, so little time. What do we do?
92	The knights of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus are seeking\nsomeone to train with. Kingdom knights are certainly\ntough, but I bet you could keep up.
93	Some soldiers stationed at F√≥dlan's Locket abandoned\ntheir posts. They weren't what you'd call upstanding folks.\nIt would be a real headache for us if they became bandits\nand started wreaking havoc in the towns.
94	The Adrestian Empire's Imperial guard is looking for\nsomeone to train with. They're said to be the cream of\nthe crop, but I'm certain you can hold your own.
95	Recently, pirates have been raiding coastal towns in the\nSreng Region. People say that they're attacking innocent\ncivilians and sinking merchant ships. Think you can do\nsomething about that?
96	My father has been curious about your competence as a\nfighter. After all I've seen, I don't see the need to test you,\nbut he insists that you show me your skills in a mock battle\nwith troops from House Fraldarius.

101	I want to start a collection that chronicles the history of\nF√≥dlan, but I'm having trouble getting my hands on\nanything significant. Honestly, it might be easier to\nexcavate an artifact rather than trying to find one for sale...
102	Don't tell anyone, but...I'm actually an Almyran merchant.\nI'm looking to export some goods from F√≥dlan and sell\nthem back in my homeland. If you help me out, I'll reward\nyou handsomely.
103	Bandits have overrun my trade route. Please, can you clear\nthem out so that the merchants can reach the monastery?
104	Hey, you. Got any broken weapons? I'll gladly take them\noff your hands, even if they're totally unusable.
105	If it is not too much trouble, please find the most beautiful\nflowers you can. We require a large number of them,\nso do not be too selective about their size.
106	There is a demand for flowers, but we have not yet\ngathered enough. Would you lend us a hand, Professor?\nIf possible, I would ask for the most beautiful flowers\nyou can find.
107	We're gathering flowers as quickly as we can, but we still\ndon't have nearly enough. Do you think you can help us?\nThe prettier, the better!
108	There's a dilapidated bridge a little ways away from\nGarreg Mach. It's a hindrance to commerce, so I'd like to\nhave it repaired. Care to invest some money in this\nrestoration project?
109	It's gone! Gone, I say! I can't do business without it...\nHey, you! Get it back for me, and I'll cut you the deal\nof your life!

152	You are responsible for choosing which house to lead.\nIf there are still students you have yet to speak with,\ntry visiting each house's homeroom.
153	The monks were real happy to see your students helping\nout with the horses, and at the pond. Is it OK if I ask\nthem for help later?
154	Thank you, Professor. That was quite helpful. I wonder if\nyou would agree to teach the other students individually\nas well? I believe that would be for the best.
155	Thank you, Professor. That was well worth the effort.\nIf you don't mind, I hope that you will teach the other\nstudents individually as well. I believe you will not be\ndisappointed with the results.
156	Sorry to have put your through that, Teach. That said...\nmaybe you could tutor the others as well? I'm sure you'll\nbe happy with the outcome!
157	How wonderful! Where the saint statues dwell looks so\nmuch better now. Perhaps you will receive a special\nblessing for carrying out such an important task!
158	Do you have a feel for training horses now? If you want\nthem to get stronger, you'd do well to look after them\nfrom now on.
159	Thank you for sharing in the culinary arts with me!\nI can tell you have exceptional taste and must truly enjoy\nmaking all manner of food as much as you do eating it.\nYou are welcome to use the kitchen whenever you please.
160	Thank you for your assistance! I'm sure there are more\nmusic lovers around the monastery, so feel free to invite\nanyone to participate in choir practice. I'll make all the\nnecessary preparations when the time comes.
161	How wonderful! I am certain Saint Cethleann would be\nmost satisfied by this fish. If you ever wish to fish again,\nsimply let the manager of the fishing pond know.
162	You have my gratitude. The¬†greenhouse is an invaluable\nresource. If we cultivate more plants, I'm sure we'll be able\nto cook a larger variety of meals.
163	Heh, so you're getting right to it! I'm impressed to find\nsomeone who's more proactive than I am. Nice going,\nProfessor. All right, then. Next time will be my turn!
164	What a remarkable piece of art! Masterful works like this\nnormally go for steep prices. You clearly have a knack for\ndealing with merchants.
165	That was helpful. Feels good, doesn't it? If you come\nacross any more lost items, be sure to find their owner\nright away.
166	Thanks to you, we were able to select those most worthy\nof fighting for us. I have registered them at the guild,\nso feel free to hire anyone you like.
167	You know how fighting tournaments work, right?\nOne-on-one fights, one after another. Each month\nthere are different tournaments. I can't wait!
168	Thank you for your help, Professor! There is nothing quite\nlike a tea party to brighten your spirits, don't you think?\nIf you would like to get to know someone better,\ntry inviting them to have tea with you.
169	Thank you so much! Now we can travel to other places\nwith ease.
170	How helpful. So, you want to repair that sword? I'll give\nyou the necessary materials for free just this once.
171	I'm so happy that you found all of the sheet music!\nIt might not be a proper thank you, but you may visit\nanytime you'd like to enjoy the music.
172	So, you took the certification exam. You may want to\nrecommend having some of the students take the test\nif you see something special in them.
173	Report cards are for securely recording information\nyou acquire. I think it's wise for you to use them to\nkeep track of your students' progress.
174	You went to the battalion guild... Track how your\nbattalion and those of others are faring...\nAlthough solitude is the true battle...
175	So, you found Jeralt visiting a grave, did you? Interesting.\nI would not have expected him to know anyone buried\nhere. Still...none of my business, I suppose.
176	The White Heron Cup sounds like it was a great success.\nNow we can all look forward to the ball. Enjoy yourself.
177	It's fun to learn like this, even as adults. How about we\nget others to join up as well? I'm sure they'll be elated\nto participate.
178	I chose some knights to help you out. They'll be deployed\nin your next real battle. I'm sure you'll be able to make\ngood use of them.
179	Resolving other people's problems is difficult... You may\nbe able to figure out what they're seeking if you become\nclose enough to spend time alone with them.

193	So...the rumors are spreading. Still, it may be ill-advised to\nmove against fellow followers of the faith. Even so, this is\ngood information to have. I thank you.
194	We've narrowed down some of the enemy's potential\nobjectives, but we'll only know if we're right when the\nday is upon us.
195	We seem to have narrowed down some of the enemy's\npossible objectives. I wonder if our conjecture is correct...\nI suppose time will reveal all.
196	I think we've narrowed down some of the enemy's possible\nobjectives. We won't know until we know, of course, but I\nhave a feeling a fight will be involved. Let's make sure\nwe're prepared for that.
197	Conand Tower? Yes, I suppose that would make a sensible\nbase for a group of thieves. I will use this information to\ninvestigate the matter further. You have my thanks.
198	Jeritza is certainly suspicious. Let's ask him directly what\nhe knows. I think he may be at the training grounds,\nor perhaps his quarters.
199	The fishing tournament is over. Flayn seemed overjoyed,\nand I'm certain that pleased Seteth as well.
200	I knew you were smart enough to bring this to me rather\nthan Shamir. No need to rub her nose in it, though.
201	This is a start, but there is still much we don't know.\nWe will need to investigate Flayn's case further.\nI will let you know if I learn anything more.
202	Interesting... It's true that a lot more people have been\ncoming and going as of late. Hmm, perhaps we could\nsecure new information if we capture someone from\nthe Imperial army. Thank you. That is quite helpful.
203	I agree that Professor Jeritza's behavior is odd. We should\nask him directly. I expect he'll be at the training grounds\nor in his quarters.
204	Jeritza is suspicious, to say the least. I think you should ask\nhim directly. He should be at the training grounds or in\nhis quarters.
205	Ha. So you know how to follow instructions. Still,\nremain respectful to Catherine as well.

222	Thanks! I was watching him as he read the letter...\nIt looks like it spooked him a bit. That's too bad.
223	Thank you! I watched Alois as he read the letter...\nI think he looked happy about it! Keehee!
224	You actually did it? You delivered it to Lady Rhea?!\nThat's so embarrassing! How will I ever face her...\nUgh. Well. Thanks, anyway.
225	Thank you! This medicinal herb is supposedly quite useful\nwhen administered to a horse who's about to give birth.\nI'm going to mix this into her feed...
226	I see... So, this is a book that covers traditional wood-\ncarving in Brigid. How fascinating. Thank you, Professor.\nI will enjoy diving into this text.
227	You're amazing, Professor! I knew I could count on you.\nI'm sure Ashe is going to love this book!
228	What an incredible magic book! I'm sure Linhardt will be\nabsolutely delighted. Thank you, Professor.
229	Ah, you found a book about gardening! I'm going to let\nDedue know right away. Thanks, Professor!
230	I am pleased to see you are taking your training seriously.\nI look forward to a strong showing from you and\nyour students.
231	How nostalgic... Though I can't just sit here getting\nsentimental. I wish there was some way to help out\nthe people in the village. They treated me so well...
232	Thank you for helping to gather resources. Please accept\nthis simple gift, by way of compensation.
233	I thank you for procuring resources. This isn't much,\nbut please accept it along with my gratitude.
234	Thanks, Professor! You did a nice job procuring resources\nfor us. Now, here's a little token of my appreciation.
235	Your assistance in collecting resources is most appreciated.\nIt may not be much, but please accept this with my thanks.
236	It really calms you down if you make a tea out of it.\nAh, even the smell is soothing! Thank you so much.\nNow I feel like I can fight again.
237	You got rid of the Big One! Now the other fish can rest\neasy. Assuming fish rest... Anyway, nice work.
238	I was pleased to hear you rescued those merchants.\nA strong economy bodes well for us. Fine work.
239	I'm happy that you moved quickly. Now the merchants\nwill be safe. Since we will be using this area as a base,\nit's critical that we secure it as best we can.
240	Amazing. All is peaceful now. And the merchants are safe.\nI wonder if we'll see any more new shops popping up at\nthe monastery. If so, what will they sell?
241	Thank you for looking after the merchants. Their safety\nis one of the keys to peace and prosperity in the region.\nYou have done us a great service.
242	So, you saved the village from bandits. Now that we've had\nthis learning experience, vigilante groups have popped up\nacross the land. Hopefully this will help protect the peace.
243	It was just a training exercise, but still, that was an\nastounding victory. The Kingdom knights were so\nimpressed that they agreed to pitch in and help at\nthe monastery.
244	I heard that you handed a crushing defeat to those\nF√≥dlan's Locket deserters. Sounds like, after your little\nintervention, they've changed their tune and are back on\nour side. Thanks for keeping 'em in line.
245	Professor, I know it was just a training exercise, but I can\nstill hardly believe you defeated the Imperial guard.\nThat was thrilling! They were so impressed, in fact,\nthat they decided to support us here at the monastery.
246	Nice work out there! Some mercenaries heard news of\nyour valiant leadership and have come to the monastery\nto offer their services.
247	Sounds like my father wanted to test your strength to\ndetermine whether or not to supply the monastery with\ntroops from House Fraldarius. I'll tell him the truth...\nthat you're more than worthy.

252	Ah, magnificent! Exactly what I was looking for.\nClearly I asked the right person for help.
253	Thanks for helping me out. Here's your reward. It's a\nstuffed Nader bear! Cute, right?! This toy is incredibly\npopular with Almyran children these days. Feel free to\nshow it off, but don't tell anyone where you got it from.
254	Thanks to you, I feel safe again. Oh, and I'll be sure to\nhave the days that traveling merchants will be visiting\nthe monastery added to the calendar.
255	Thank you. And if you break any more weapons, be sure\nto send them my way. They will all be put to good use.\n...What am I using them for? That's no concern of yours.
256	Lady Edelgard adorns the graves of the fallen with flowers\nafter each and every battle. Thank you for ensuring that\nshe does not have to do so alone.
257	His Highness visits the graveyard after every battle and\nplaces flowers on the graves of those who have fallen.\nThough it is hard for him to accept such loss, I believe he\nwishes to pay them the honor they deserve.
258	Claude says that flowers on a grave are as much for\nthe living as they are for the dead. If the dead don't look\nso solemn, then neither will we. That's Claude for you...\nAlways trying to brighten things up a little.
259	Thank you for your investing in my venture! You won't\nregret it. When that bridge is fixed, people can come and\ngo much more easily. Business is gonna flow right in.\nWe'll all have more money than we know what to do with!
260	Thanks, friend! That's a huge relief. Now I can finally\nopen up shop! I'll be sure to swing by the monastery again,\nso keep an eye on the schedule and bring lots of gold!

1	Welcome to the Garg Mach Monestary. Being Jeralt's\nchild is sufficient in terms of qualification. Be confident\nas you instruct your students. I have high expectations for\nyou.
2	Teachers choose one of 11 subjects to focus on each\nmonth. When choosing a subject, consider both the\nTalents of your students, as well as the extent of their\nstudies so far.
3	Students will ask you questions after a lecture. These\nqueries often seem unrelated to the class... Still,\ndo your best to answer them. This will raise your \nstudents' motivation, even if it's just a little.
4	How well a student responds to tutoring largely depends\non the student's motivation, which means it's very\nimportant for us as teachers to always be working towards\nbringing out that motivation.
5	Education is not limited to within the walls of the\nmonastery! You may assign extracurricular activities to\nseveral students. We want them to gain experiences \nthey cannot get from a lecture.
6	Boy, this monastery sure is big... I hear you can trade with\nother countries in the Market. It's almost like this\nmonastery is its own country.
7	Hmm, they're gonna let a newbie like you lead an army?\nI'm gonna be watching how you command veeery closely.
8	People in the Officer's Academy are always dropping all \nsorts of stuff. Like books, or stuff to write with... I'll never\nbe finished with cleaning up. And I like cleaning! I just \nwish everyone would be careful with their stuff.
9	It's just a statue of a worldly saint that'll give you benefits\nif you improve it. That being said, I suppose there's no\nharm in getting its blessing.
10	It seems you've grown quite comfortable in your role as a\nteacher. I've become very curious about the students in\nyour class.
11	Hehe, your students are all quite interesting, aren't they?\nI want to hear more about them.
12	Hmm... Just as this girl says, to teach others, you must also\nlearn for yourself. It should also lead you to discovering\nnew abilities
13	Hmph, they pushed quite the dangerous task on you,\nhuh? Looks like every month, you'll have to collect as\nmuch information as possible before you act.
14	Professor, here's the roster of your students' names. \nIt also lists what subject they're especially\nskilled in, as well as a little personal information, \nso do be sure to use it for reference.
15	If you don't know which to choose, why don't\nyou talk to the students again? You could aslo learn useful\ninformation by talking to people other than the students.
16	Everyone expects a high level of leadership from us \nteachers. Of course, interacting with your \nstudents is what makes you a successful teacher.
17	Before you begin tutoring a student, compare their \naptitude to the topic you're focusing on for that month. \nIf they have an aptitude for it AND it's the topic for that \nmonth, you should definitely see results.
18	Oh, yeah... be sure to check the Bulletin Board too, okay?\nThere'll be requests from students, or other teachers, and\ninformation about the Market. Handling some of those \nrequests allows you to use certain facilities, too.
19	Don't forget, time flies! Make sure you have a plan so you\ndon't spend all of your time talking with your students \nthen suddenly realize it's the day of the mock battle, \nokay, Professor?
20	The ability for a student to trust their teacher can\nlead to a greater desire to learn. You should proactively \nwork to strengthen your bonds with your students \noutside of class, as well.
21	Naturally, you, I, and Manuela each have \ndifferent strengths in education. And, so, when \na student makes a strong request, we do allow \nthem to transfer to a different House.
22	From this mock battle onwards, I'll have everyone\ncommand knights in battle. Seeing as nearly all of you will\nbe commanding armies in the near future and all.
23	You've got to let soldiers wounded in battle rest, of course.\nKeep a constant eye on how many knights you've got left.
24	If you command a troop of knights, you can launch a\ngambit against the enemy. Use Gambits well to Rattle\nthe enemy. Just be careful not to exhaust your battalion\nendurance, yeah?
25	When launching an attack at the enemy, check to see if\nthere's an ally in a position to link up with. Especially\nwhen launching a gambit, you should be doubly sure to\nlink up with an ally.
26	When you pass a Certification Exam, you may become a\nmore advanced class. However, it will be difficult to pass\nunless you've attained the required skills for that class.

3	A Lord must know how to command others. Authority is\ntherefore a must. It is also traditional to study sword\ntechnique. Will you help me with these endeavors?
4	Lords must be leaders, so strong authority should be\nconsidered a requirement. They also fight from the front\nlines, and thus need to know how to handle a sword.\nSuch are my goals... Are we aligned?
5	A Lord has to lead troops into battle, so it's important that\nI master authority. And if I'm going to hold my own in the\nvanguard, I'll need to achieve sword mastery as well.\nMight be a challenge, but nothing I can't handle.
6	I prefer to slay my enemies without having to lay a finger\non them. With that kind of power, why would I bother\nwith normal weapons? By focusing on reason, I can be\na great magic user.
7	A noble must know how to ride a horse, to be certain,\nand should know how to wield a lance, as that is the most\nobvious weapon of choice for a rider. As a noble among\nnobles, it seems natural that I focus on these two skills.
8	If I must go to battle, it's best for me to study faith and be\na Bishop. Playing a supporting role should keep me far\naway from the carnage.
9	I wanna blast through battle, cutting my enemies down\nleft and right, and the best way to do that is with an axe!\nHelp me train my axe skills so I can be a great Warrior!
10	If I have to hit someone, I want to do it from so far away\nthat there's no way I can get hit back. I think I want to\nmaster the bow, and then people everywhere will know\nme as Bernie the Sniper!
11	Most nobles seem to think magic is their birthright and\nthat commoners lack the talent for it. Help me master\nreason and train as a Warlock to prove them wrong.
12	People are calling me a Thief, but I would never be doing\nbad things. It is because I am moving very quickly without\nmy enemies noticing. This is why I must be learning the\nbow and sword.
13	My purpose is to be a shield for His Highness. Please help\nme improve my axe and heavy armor skills.
14	I've known how to swing a sword since I was a boy, but\nI still have a lot to learn before I can be called a master.\nI would ask you to help me temper my sword skills.
15	I'm not exactly the most imposing figure on the battlefield,\nso I think it's best for me to focus on my bow skills and do\nmy work from a distance.
16	You know, jousting is a popular sport in Faerghus.\nThe ladies love a guy who can joust. Speaking of...\nLet's polish up my riding and lance skills.
17	For me, there is nothing worse than seeing those I care\nabout come to harm. That's why I want to study faith and\nhelp others as a Bishop.
18	My passion has always been for sorcery! With that passion\nand some more time studying reason, I can be a powerful\nmagic user!
19	I have always admired Pegasus Knights for the versatility\nthey bring to battle. By studying flight, as well as the lance,\nI am sure to be useful no matter the terrain.
20	When I envision nobles in battle, I see them gallantly\nracing across the field on horseback, trusty lance in hand.\nIt is my duty to meet this ideal, hence my interest in\nlance and riding skills.
21	People say my muscles'll make me a great War Master,\nand I've got nothing against working on my axe and\nbrawling skills. Whaddaya think, Professor?
22	A physique like mine isn't suited to combat in close\nquarters, so I think I can be most helpful by using a bow.\nLet's hope I don't ever lose my glasses.
23	Sorcery is my natural talent, so it was inevitable that I'd\nchoose to be a Warlock. It's not easy, but no need to fear.\nI will never tire of studying reason.
24	I don't have any talents of my own, so all I can really do is\npray to the goddess. Maybe if I truly master my faith,\nshe'll show me the role I am meant to fulfill.
25	I'm pretty good with an axe, since it's a House Goneril\ntradition to learn it from a young age. Stick to what\nyou know, right? Easier that way.
26	I love bows, of course, but archery alone will never make\nme an elite mercenary. If I want to follow Captain Jeralt's\nexample, I need to hone my riding and lance skills.
27	
28	I believe I am better suited to healing than to fighting.\nRather than train with traditional weapons, then, I think it\nbest for me to focus upon my faith.
29	
30	
31	
32	
33	
34	
35	I used to look after wyverns back in Almyra, so I know\nhow to handle 'em. I can ride one into battle. But it'd be\nnice if ya helped me work on my axe and flying skills.

2/0
1	No need to concern yourself with trivialities,\nLady Edelgard. I will handle this.
2	Hubert, the whole point is for us to achieve this\ntogether, don't you think?
3	Perhaps you're right. Then let's see it done quickly.
4	An impressive result we've gotten.
5	We showed remarkable teamwork, much better than\nwe could have achieved with anyone else.
6	We have no good excuse for it, but somehow we\ncame up short.
7	Agreed. The bar may have been set rather too high.
8	Being preoccupied with Imperial duties is no excuse.
9	Here at Garreg Mach, I must do my part as a\nmember of the team.
10	I would advise you to pace yourself, but it's probably\npointless. Let's proceed.
11	Good results come easily for the two of us.
12	We are the emperor and the Minister of the Imperial\nHousehold, after all.
13	Honestly an average result should disappoint an\nextraordinary pair like us.
14	Right you are. The two of us should have done much\nbetter than this.
15	
16	
17	
18	
19	
20	
21	
22	All I look for in a meal is a full stomach. You seem to\nbe after something more than that, Lady Edelgard.
23	True. I feel that sharing a table with people you're\nclose to is a precious opportunity that should never\nbe taken for granted.
24	Heh. When the three of us sit together like this\nat the table...
25	Let me guess, we look as though we're plotting\nsomething wicked? You realize you're mostly to\nblame for that.
26	
27	
28	I cannot stand to see you reduced to this menial task.
29	Everyone else does it, and I will too. I don't want any\nspecial treatment.
30	I am all for equality, but this is a matter of suitability.
31	It's rather impressive how well we destroyed\nthis place. Some areas are still useless.
32	The emperor cleaning out the monastery. Heh.\nWhat a ridiculous image.
33	Quiet, Hubert. We've set up base here, so what\nchoice do we have?
34	Our professor is certainly adventurous, but I wonder\nwhat the point was of putting us on the same team...
35	What? You think teaming up with me is a bad idea?
36	Yes. Results or no results, this is far from a\ngreat idea.
37	What a splendid result! I am rather proud of myself,\nI must say.
38	Is that so? In any case, I think it's time for a break.
39	Hm. I was hoping we would do better.
40	It's a decent result for two people who don't get\nalong terribly well.
41	Put your heart into it, Ferdinand! It'll be over\nsooner if you do.
42	Yes. Right. I will try not to slow you down.
43	Nothing could slow me down for something trivial\nlike this.
44	Impressive. Your skills are unparalleled. You could\nhave done it alone just as easily.
45	It's not like you to say that. But honestly, we both\npulled our weight.
46	A decent result... At least we didn't run into\nany issues.
47	It is my fault, I am afraid. I really dragged us down...
48	You can count on me! There is not a noble in the\nwhole Empire more capable than I.
49	Oh, Ferdinand... I appreciate the confidence, but\ndon't get carried away.
50	I have no doubt that, working together, you and I\nwill excel.
51	That went better than expected. Our teamwork is\nclearly improving.
52	I would say so. Look, Professor! The fruit of\nour labor!
53	I cannot believe that we, two exceptional nobles,\nachieved such a mediocre result.
54	That's quite enough. I told you not to get\ncarried away.
55	I know why you sat us next to each other. You want\nto see who can eat more quickly.
56	Ferdinand. Please stop making everything a\ncompetition against me.
57	Ferdinand, I hope you'll take this opportunity to\nspeak freely to me.
58	Tch! I do not require your permission to speak\nmy mind.
59	Ferdinand, you can say what you like about me some\nother time. For now, let's just enjoy a nice meal.
60	You do not understand! It is my solemn duty as a\nnoble to explain why you are wrong.
61	
62	
63	
64	
65	
66	
67	I will not be a burden. I will be doing my best\nfor Lady Edelgard!
68	Don't worry, Petra. There is no use in fearing failure.
69	It is my duty to help others when necessary.
70	Petra, our teamwork has yielded a report for\nthe professor.
71	The Empire and Brigid, working with each other.\nThe future has hope...
72	I have sorrow, Lady Edelgard. We did not achieve a\ngood result.
73	Worry not, Petra. At least we completed our task.
74	You and I are both heirs to an immense burden.\nThere is no need to hold back around each other.
75	Yes. We will work with each other and be aiming\nfor perfection!
76	
77	We were working well with each other. Can we be\nshaking hands now?
78	It seems a bit soon for that but...certainly.
79	Our result was passing. You have my thanks.
80	And you have mine, Petra. I look forward to working\nwith you again.
81	
82	
83	
84	
85	
86	
87	
88	Do you miss the food of your homeland, Petra?\nI wish there was a way to get some for you.
89	I have gratitude for your kindness. But it is OK.\nI am liking the food of F√≥dlan.
90	Food of the palace is extravagant, but food of the\nbattlefield is very plain. Are you finding it difficult\nto be adjusting?
91	Heh, no! It is not so bad. In all honesty, I have had\nto eat much worse food in the past.
92	
93	
94	
95	
96	
97	
98	
99	
100	I do not believe I am required to team up with you.
101	I would rather work with almost anyone else,\nbut I will do what needs to be done.
102	Hm. Of course, we will both do what we have to.\nBut do not drag me down to your level.
103	Look at this beautiful achievement! Hubert was no\nhelp at all though.
104	Your inability to face reality is just another reason\nyou are inferior to Lady Edelgard.
105	We could have done better if we had each been more\nwilling to compromise.
106	You are right about that. We were both stubborn for\nfoolish reasons.
107	Hubert, working with you is...acceptable. I suppose.
108	Very well. Same here.
109	Ha. It seems we are in agreement.
110	Seems our rivalry worked in our favor.
111	We were just lucky. I am glad we have a positive\nresult to report, however we achieved it.
112	You need to stop being so stubborn! We were never\nquite working in concert.
113	I could say the same to you. We're lucky to finish\nthis with so little trouble.
114	No wall is too high for us to scale, now that we\nunderstand and respect each other.
115	Must you be so dramatic? Let's just get this done.
116	Do not spoil it! Let me enjoy the moment, please.
117	For the two of us, this was only a trifle.
118	I feel the same, Hubert. The professor must be\npleased with our glorious triumph as well.
119	Hm. That was hardly calamitous, but we could have\ndone better.
120	Quite right. Let's be sure to improve for next time.
121	Why are we seated beside each other? I cannot enjoy\nmy food with you sitting here.
122	Just shut up and eat.
123	Can we put our quarrel on hold, Ferdinand, at least\nwhile the professor is present?
124	Of course we can, Hubert. We will finish eating and\nthen continue fighting elsewhere.
125	I know you prefer tea. I'll prepare some, if you like.
126	No, I will have coffee. It has been a while. You sit\nhere while I pour us each a cup.
127	
128	
129	
130	
131	
132	
133	All right! Come on, Linhardt, let's do this!
134	You've always got so much energy. Shall I leave \neverything to you?
135	No way, I'm not falling for that again! We're doing\nthis together!
136	What an astounding result. Isn't that so, Professor?\nIt's all down to Caspar of course.
137	Your honesty is usually annoying, but I don't mind it\nwhen you're complimenting me!
138	There. Finally finished. We probably could've done\nbetter if you took this more seriously.
139	No matter how serious I am, I simply cannot give \nthat which I do not have...to give.
140	It would be bad form to leave everything for you,\nCaspar. Of course I'll try.
141	A-are you feeling all right, Linhardt? You just said\nyou'd "try" at something, so you must be delirious!
142	I'm not sure I like it when you talk like that.
143	Haha! Enemies don't stand a chance when we're\non the case!
144	"Enemy" might be a little much. Yet it is certainly\ntrue that the result was a positive one.
145	Well, we tried. I suppose that's sufficient. I'm leaving\nthe report to you, Caspar.
146	No problem! I'll make sure it's exciting!
147	
148	
149	
150	
151	
152	
153	
154	Yeah! It's eating time! Come on, let's dig in!
155	Caspar, do develop table manners. Begin by chewing\nwith your mouth closed, especially when I'm around.
156	You never know if each meal together might be\nour last. I try to treasure these moments.
157	I get what you're saying, but you shouldn't be so\ngrim! Let's survive so we can keep eating together!
158	
159	
160	Hah! These weeds don't stand a chance against me!
161	Please try not to pull up any flowers or shrubs by\naccident, Caspar.
162	Come on! I can tell the difference between a flower\nand a weed! Like this one...actually, what is this one?
163	I don't believe this job is for me. It's more for \nsomeone with muscles.
164	Exactly! Just leave it to me! I'm gonna smash the\nrubble to bits and sweep it away!
165	Yes... I should probably just leave it all to people \nlike Caspar. Ugh...
166	You seem not to like me for some reason. I do not\nhave any issues with you.
167	You don't have issues with me, but I have plenty\nwith you. Let's just do our assignment, OK?
168	Hm, all right. I will do what I can.
169	We make a good team! This is an admirable result.
170	We are not a good team, but we did well enough.
171	Satisfied, Ferdie? Then you can take care\nof reporting our results.
172	I am sorry. I was not focused. I was too distracted\nwondering why Dorothea hates me.
173	Leave it to me. I can handle it all by myself.
174	By yourself? That's not how doing things\ntogether works.
175	Oh, I suppose that is true. Sorry, I got quite ahead\nof myself.
176	Would you look at that. Can you not see, Dorothea?\nWe make a great team.
177	Maybe we do, maybe we don't. I'm still not very fond\nof you.
178	You know, that was pretty good. I suppose I should\nsay thanks. So, thanks.
179	Perhaps if you did not despise me so, we would have\ndone better!
180	Oh. I'm with you, Ferdie. This should be fun.
181	Dorothea, being nice to me? I will do my best!\nLike my very life depends on it!
182	Your life doesn't have to depend on... Let's just do\nthings normally.
183	What an astonishing outcome! Only you and I could\nhave achieved this, Dorothea.
184	OK, Ferdie. You're right this time.
185	Not a bad result, but I cannot help but feel that you\nand I could aim higher.
186	You may be right. Let me know if you want to try\nagain sometime.
187	Food tastes best when you are sharing it with others.\nDo you not think so, Dorothea?
188	Yes. Present company excluded, of course.
189	The food here is simple but well-prepared. A meal\ncan be delicious without being fancy.
190	Come again? I've never heard a nobleman say\nanything like that.
191	Sharing a meal with your allies makes you forget\nthe differences in where you're all from.
192	So, you finally approve of me?! Let us toast to that!
193	Oh my. Ferdie, are you going to be OK with such\ndifficult manual labor as weeding?
194	It is no trouble. I used to help the gardener on my\nfamily's estate. I can weed with the best of them.
195	A gardener and a nobleman. My, how refined.
196	Leave it to me to carry the rubble, Dorothea.\nThis task is too rough for your delicate hands.
197	Are you implying that women aren't strong? What if\nI punch you, then we have this discussion again?
198	Ah, forget I said anything! Let's do this together.
199	I get to be with Alois? Yes! I feel so much better!
200	If you need help leaving your room, I'll be happy to\ndrag you out of there!
201	What?! You're supposed to be on my side!
202	We did it! All thanks to Bernadetta's hard work.
203	Yes! With you here, Alois, I can take on anything!
204	Did I do all right? I tried my best.
205	Yes, we did a fine job. Always room for\nimprovement though.
206	
207	
208	
209	
210	
211	
212	
213	
214	
215	
216	
217	
218	
219	
220	There's no one I'd rather eat with than the professor\nand Alois!
221	Hear, hear... Hm. This old chair keeps creaking.\nI fear it's on its last legs. Hah!
222	
223	
224	
225	
226	
227	
228	
229	
230	
231	
232	Lorenz, you need not worry about this.\nI can handle it.
233	No cause for concern, Ferdinand. This will hardly\nbe difficult for me.
234	Ah! In that case, I will take a seat and watch.
235	The expected result, for someone of my skills.
236	Yes, we did quite well! All thanks to me, of course.
237	This is hardly the example I should be setting for\nthe commonfolk.
238	I wholly agree. As a noble, you should really have\nperformed better than that.
239	The professor has the right idea, requesting us.
240	Yes, provided we meet expectations.
241	Let us do more than that. Let us alter the very course\nof history with our own hands!
242	Professor, look upon our glorious achievement!\nI hope you are not blinded by its brilliance.
243	All the same, you must shade your eyes and look.\nYou would not want to miss history in the making.
244	I sought perfection, and I fell far short. I apologize.
245	I am also to blame. As noblemen, we must bear\nresponsibility for our failures.
246	The professor has the right idea, requesting us.
247	Yes, provided we meet expectations.
248	Let us do more than that. Let us alter the very course\nof history with our own hands!
249	Professor, look upon our glorious achievement!\nI hope you are not blinded by its brilliance.
250	All the same, you must shade your eyes and look.\nYou would not want to miss history in the making.
251	I sought perfection, and I fell far short. I apologize.
252	I am also to blame. As noblemen, we must bear\nresponsibility for our failures.
253	Pristine manners are essential, even if the quality of\nthe food is poor. Wouldn't you agree, Ferdinand?
254	Indeed. We may not care for the meal, but we must\nshow our respect for the person who cooked it.
255	I am sure the chef is quite capable. There is only\nso much you can do with mediocre ingredients.\nPerhaps I am expecting too much.
256	We will just have to refresh ourselves with fine tea.\nI have brought the very best.
257	To share a table with you is a comfort in these\ndifficult times.
258	I feel precisely the same, Lorenz. Such cheerful\nmoments give me the will to keep going.
259	
260	
261	
262	
263	
264	
265	All right, Manuela! Let's do this together.
266	The Mittelfrank Opera Company way!
267	Time to put on a show they'll never forget!
268	You were great. What an amazing result.
269	It's all because I could count on you.
270	Hmm, that was everything we needed to do, but it\nfeels like we still came up a little short.
271	I agree. We could've done even better.
272	You know, Manuela, lately I've been really happy\nworking with you.
273	What a sweet thing to say. I feel the same, Dorothea.
274	So, let's take care of this quickly. Together.
275	You know, I'm starting to think the two of us can\naccomplish something big.
276	I agree. We can be huge, Manuela.
277	It's finished. Want to join me for a cup of tea\nafter this?
278	I like the way you think, kid. Maybe we can invite\nthe professor too.
279	
280	
281	
282	
283	
284	
285	
286	Look at how fancy the professor is! Dining with two\nstars of the stage. You must be flattered, no?
287	We can't sing and dance our way through the meal,\nbut do you like the opera, Professor? 
288	Having a meal like this reminds me of the old days,\neating alongside the rest of the opera company.
289	So true. I really miss those days. Oh, sorry Professor.\nI didn't mean to leave you out of the conversation.
290	
291	
292	
293	
294	
295	
296	
297	
298	Please take a rest, Your Highness. Allow me to take\ncare of this.
299	I cannot allow it. The two of us can take care of\nthis quickly.
300	Very well. As you say.
301	Professor, I am here to report the result.\nWe successfully finished everything.
302	I am sorry to put you through the trouble.
303	The work is done, Professor. We did rather well.
304	True enough. Except that Dedue ended up doing all\nof my work too...
305	You excel at this. Will you help me again\nsometime, Dedue?
306	Naturally.
307	Then let's carry on as usual. Oh, and you had better\nleave some work for me!
308	Thanks to your help, Your Highness, we produced\nan excellent result.
309	No, it was you who helped most. I hope we can\ncontinue to support each other.
310	Surprisingly, the result was not great. I feel we\nshould have been able to do better.
311	Perhaps. But our work may still be sufficient.
312	
313	
314	
315	
316	
317	
318	
319	Mmm.
320	Remember this, Professor. That look on Dedue's face\nmeans he thinks the food is pretty tasty.
321	I never thought I would be able to enjoy a meal\nwith my friends again...
322	No one is to blame. But yes, we should eat together\nmore often.
323	
324	
325	By the way, sometimes you find edible plants\namong the weeds.
326	Please do not eat the weeds.
327	I am just saying...
328	Dedue, why don't you take a break? As the saying\ngoes, the right person for the right job...
329	Leaving it to you may be quicker, Your Highness,\nbut it would not be right.
330	I was joking. Do not look so troubled! Let's work\ntogether and get this done.
331	Complaining will not help. You had better\nget serious, Felix.
332	Ugh...
333	We have a rocky road ahead...
334	Well, it is a pretty decent result. Somehow it all\nworked out.
335	Hmph. That's the last time I work with you, boar.
336	One thing I want to say, Professor. This is the last\ntime I work with the boar.
337	You are giving me a headache... In any case, I have\nmanaged to finish the work.
338	You again.
339	Complaining again? It is a waste of time, Felix.
340	Hmph.
341	The boar can be useful sometimes, if you know how\nto handle him. I'd say I handled him well this time.
342	Yes... You have done a good job too, Felix.
343	It is finally done... I feel like you and I worked\nbetter before.
344	Stop talking about the past. I'm leaving.
345	Hey, Dimitri. Don't drag me down with you.
346	I will be careful. Nonetheless, it is assuring to know\nyou will be with me.
347	Hah... Careful, right. C'mon. Let's get this done.
348	That was better than I expected. We work so well\ntogether it's eerie.
349	I feel the same. But we have known each other since\nchildhood, after all. It makes sense.
350	Professor, you should praise Felix. He worked so\nhard it was almost impossible to believe it was\nreally him.
351	Stop it, boar. I worked hard because you made me.
352	Is something wrong? You're eating like you hate\nthe food.
353	Oh? That was not my intention, but I apologize if\nI hurt your feelings.
354	Now I remember. You used to like meat. You can\nhave mine if you want, Felix.
355	No, thanks. I don't want it. You eat it. Don't want\nyou fainting from hunger.
356	You used to whine unless you could do everything\nwith me...
357	Time for you to shut up and eat now. Got it?\nEnjoy the meal.
358	
359	
360	
361	
362	
363	
364	To work with Gilbert himself... How reassuring.
365	I am honored, Your Highness. Shall we get to the\nwork at hand?
366	Yes, of course.
367	We are done, Gilbert. All is easy when I am\nwith you.
368	I knew we would make for a good team,\nbut I did not expect us to do quite this well.
369	The result may not be flawless, but I would say we\nhave done a fine job together.
370	I agree. If we get another chance, I am sure our\nresults will be ever greater.
371	You must be tired from doing all of these chores.\nI would not mind taking care of them by myself...
372	Nonsense. What knight would dare allow his \nmaster to work for him?
373	Hah, I suppose you have a point. Then we will just\nhave to take care of it together.
374	We prove to be an excellent team, Your Highness.
375	I agree. We understand each other well.
376	Not a bad result, but, as you always used to say,\nwe should not be satisfied with anything less\nthan excellence.
377	You have a good memory. Next time we shall double\nour efforts, yes?
378	
379	
380	
381	
382	
383	
384	
385	This is quite delicious.
386	So you say, but you do not seem to be eating.\nAre you feeling all right, Gilbert?
387	Your Highness. Did I fail to teach you proper \ntable manners?
388	What? Oh... Thank you. I will be more careful.\nI developed a bad habit these past five years.
389	
390	
391	
392	
393	
394	
395	
396	
397	Ugh, I'm with Ingrid? I'm not gonna get away \nwith anything.
398	Stop messing around and get moving. You don't\nwork, you don't eat.
399	Fine, fine. Let's do this!
400	Hey, we did pretty well. All because I really went \nfor it, of course.
401	You're a glib one, aren't you, Sylvain? I did the bulk\nof the work here, you know...
402	Ah, seems we've finally finished.
403	That's it! I'm done! No more work for me, especially\nnot with her...not in a million years.
404	Hey, Ingrid, this kind of work is definitely your \nthing, and I've got some urgent business, so...
405	I can't finish this all alone. Try to be helpful\nsometimes, Sylvain.
406	Are you that helpless?
407	Heh... How's that, Professor? If ya ask me, I think \nwe did pretty well.
408	Yes, Sylvain put his back into it for once. Next thing\nwe know, pigs will be taking to the air.
409	I wouldn't call it a rousing success, but it went OK,\nall things considered. Right?
410	Well, it went OK once I rolled up my sleeves and\nhelped you.
411	Me and Ingrid? Hm, I guess I'll get to work.
412	Well now, a rare and welcome proclamation. You're\na real sight to behold when you try to be.
413	Yeah, yeah, all right. What's with you today?
414	Professor, here's the report. Perfect, don't you think?
415	Ingrid and I go way back. If we couldn't manage to\ncooperate, then what would that say about us?
416	I don't want to complain since we did OK and all,\nbut that could have gone a lot better.
417	I think so too... Next time, I'll try even harder.
418	Professor, keep an eye on Ingrid. She'll swipe all the \ngood bits for herself.
419	I would do no such thing! Sure, I like eating, but not\nto the point of thievery!
420	It's weirdly soothing watching you just shovel it right\nin there. What's with the appetite today?
421	None of your business. I can't help it, OK? Everyone\ngets hungry after exercise!
422	After the fighting's done, we should all go on a\ngourmet's journey around the world. What say you?
423	That sounds like fun. What do you think, Professor?\nUp for a culinary adventure?
424	Weeds have it tough. They sprout then get ripped \nright out of the ground. I'll do my best to be gentle.
425	Are you seriously trying to seduce a weed?\nUnbelievable.
426	What? No! Come on. I was just talking to myself.
427	If I had to clear this out by myself, I think even I\nwould get depressed...
428	Fine, fine, I'm not going to leave it all for you.
429	Let's do it quick though...before I change my mind.\nI'll grab the heavy-looking chunks. You get the rest.
430	So, Your Highness, you're gonna keep the scolding \nto a minimum, yeah?
431	Why are you assuming you will be scolded?\nAll you need to do is take things seriously.
432	Yeah, OK.
433	Professor, the work is now complete. Sylvain did his\njob as well.
434	Was getting yelled at my job? Because, yeah. \nI did that.
435	Professor... It's... It's finally over...
436	You are quick to tire out, Sylvain. You should\nconsider building your stamina.
437	Hey, Sylvain. I would like your help for\ntoday's work.
438	Heh, so you've finally learned you can't do \neverything yourself?
439	You have helped me to learn several things.\nI count on you, Sylvain.
440	Professor, don't you think we did pretty well?\nHis Highness here did most of it.
441	No, it was not all my doing. We made it thanks to\nyour help, Sylvain.
442	The result was fine... Though I thought we could\nhave aimed even higher.
443	Agreed. Let's come up with a better plan next time.
444	
445	
446	
447	
448	
449	
450	
451	You know what, Professor? His Highness here is the\nmost stubborn guy I know.
452	Now, Sylvain, why not go ahead and eat?\nIf you do not, I may help myself to it.
453	By the way, how delicious are the monastery\nmeals, right? We sure don't eat like this back in\nthe Kingdom.
454	I agree. If we could only grow more food on our\npoor soil, and in the severe winter of the north...
455	
456	
457	
458	
459	
460	
461	
462	
463	I'm so glad I get to do this with you, Annie! I'm sure\nit'll be fun!
464	That's no good, Mercie! Fun is fine and all,\nbut results are what counts!
465	I know that, silly. I can have fun without holding\nus back!
466	It all turned out pretty well! And it's thanks to your\nefforts, Mercie!
467	You're the one who did all the hard work, Annie.\nNow that it's over, how does some tea sound?
468	We've finished our work, Professor. Apologies for\ntaking so long!
469	Sorry! We, uh, got carried away chatting during\nour break...
470	So... Let's do our best, OK, Mercie?
471	Right... Let's finish this quickly.
472	Today I guess we should get it done\nwithout chatting.
473	Professor, we finished up quickly this time. I think\nwe've got some decent results!
474	Right! If we can maintain this same pace next time...\nWell, it'll probably still be unpleasant.
475	We're all done here, Professor! I guess I'll be going...
476	Oh, yes! It would be great if we could work together\nagain sometime.
477	I'm feeling great today, Annie! Let's get to it!
478	Leave it to me! With the two of us together, we'll get\nit done in a snap!
479	I hope you're right! Let's get this over with so we can\nhave a cup of tea.
480	How's that, Professor? Isn't it just perfect?
481	Look how easy it is when Mercie and I put our backs\ninto it!
482	Not a bad conclusion, Mercie. But maybe we should\nhave put more effort into it?
483	Goodness, Annie. You always work so hard, but I\nsuppose I could try just a little harder.
484	Today's dish was so good! Oh, but not as good as\nyour homemade sweets, Mercie!
485	You're too kind. Maybe I'll bake some for you next\ntime, Professor.
486	It's, uh...really tasty.
487	Yeah... Please, help yourself...
488	Sitting around a nice meal and eating with friends is\nthe best!
489	I know you're excited, but you'll choke on your food\nif you don't take time to chew!
490	Argh, there are so many! Is it possible to finish in\na single day?
491	I'm not sure... But even if we don't finish, it probably\nwon't be much of a problem!
492	Same old Mercie! Well, let's do this!
493	Phew, there's a ton of rubble here. I wonder if we'll\never clear all of it away...
494	Hm? That's not like you, Annie. I'm sure that if we\ntry our best, we'll definitely finish up...eventually!
495	You're right! Let's do our best today!
496	It's been years since the last time we did something\ntogether, Father...
497	Remain calm. Focused. Think before acting.
498	Don't make fun of me! I know that!
499	Well done, Annette. Good result. You head back. \nI'll report this.
500	There you go again... You always try to do\neverything by yourself.
501	That went pretty well, I guess. I had fun, Father.
502	Oh, you did? That's good.
503	Annette, if something happens, you must tell \nme right away.
504	Hmph. I'm a grown-up now. You're the one who's\nold and needs to take it easy!
505	Hm. I will keep that in mind.
506	Professor, look! Haha, I think I've done pretty well!
507	Yes. I think she has earned the right to be proud.
508	You could have done better, Annette.
509	Right. If I can team up with you again, I want to try\na different approach.
510	
511	
512	
513	
514	
515	
516	
517	Pardon me, Professor. I am happy to accept your \ninvitation, but...
518	Well, to tell you the truth, I'm...at a loss as to what\nI should talk about.
519	Haha! The food tastes great today, but my father can\ncook very well too!
520	I certainly know the basics of cooking. Please, allow\nme to treat you next time.
521	
522	
523	
524	
525	
526	
527	
528	
529	All right, Caspar, let's get started. The first thing\nwe should do is divide up the work...
530	Aw! Come on, don't be like that! We gotta just\njump in and figure it out as we go!
531	That's not how things are done! Hey, don't start yet!
532	That went pretty well. We managed to make it work!
533	Hehe, yeah...I am exhausted though.
534	Glad we got through it without a problem.\nFor a while, I was worried.
535	Hah! I told you it'd be fine. Sometimes you just gotta\nwing it!
536	All right, Ashe. Let's get to it! Where should\nwe begin?
537	Dividing up the work is a good way to do it.
538	Ugh...fine! You're probably right. Let's be quick\nabout it though!
539	I can't really complain about these results!
540	Look how much we can get done when we actually\nwork together!
541	Thanks, Caspar. This got done much faster\nthan I expected.
542	No problem! Now we've got some extra time\nto train!
543	
544	
545	
546	
547	
548	
549	
550	Caspar! Your stomach will burst if you eat all of that!
551	Haha! Don't worry about me, I've got a stomach of\nsteel! Professor knows what I'm talking about!
552	I gotta say Ashe, you can really put your food away!
553	I've got to keep up my strength, don't I?
554	
555	
556	
557	
558	
559	
560	
561	
562	Heya, Claude! You're looking so cute today. I have a\nquick favor to ask...
563	Wait, that's my line. You just try to get to work\nwithout slacking, OK?
564	Me?! Look who's talking. You have no work ethic to\nspeak of.
565	Professor, look! I guess it pays off to put in a little\neffort sometimes.
566	Hey, all you did was cheer from the sidelines!\nYou didn't do any work at all...
567	Well, that was nothing to write home about. Maybe\nif Claude had put in some effort for once...
568	Are you really blind to your own slacking?!\nOh well... We'll do better next time.
569	You know, Hilda... One day I'd love to see you\nat your full strength.
570	What are you talking about? I always give it my all.\nYou're the one who's constantly goofing around.
571	Well, if you think that's what passes for full\nstrength... Anyway, let's get started.
572	Claude did such a wonderful job, don't you think?\nHe really helped me out back there.
573	You didn't do so bad yourself. Wait... Are you\npraising me so I'll do your work next time too?
574	We pushed ourselves and still ended up with\nthis mess... Well, at least it's over.
575	That could have gone better. Maybe next time I'll\nput in a little more effort.
576	I guess I have no choice. I'll have to really put my\nback into it.
577	You've learned that there's no sweet talking me,\nhave you? Then I'll work without slacking too.
578	I guess if we both take it seriously, we're bound to\nget good results, right?
579	Check this out, Teach. This is what happens when\nHilda actually works at something!
580	I didn't mean to do so well! Please don't raise\nyour expectations.
581	Hmm, we didn't manage to divide up the work\nwell enough. I didn't mean to cut corners...
582	That's a bit of a letdown. Maybe we can do better\nnext time around?
583	OK, I am fuuuull. Want some, Professor?
584	Don't fall for it, Teach. Hilda's gifts always come\nwith a price. She'll be asking you to do this or that\nfor her in return, mark my words.
585	This meager meal isn't enough to fill me up.\nI'd really prefer a daily, lavish feast!
586	Feasts are special because they're kinda rare. If you\nhad a feast every day, you'd start to be sick of 'em.
587	Thanks to you two, I get to sit down and enjoy this\ntasty meal.
588	A meal you can eat while listening to Hilda praise\nyou is a gift all its own. Right, Teach?
589	Claude, you're such a natural at this! You really\nknow how to make weeding look good.
590	Looking good while weeding isn't the best of\ncompliments. Now get back to work.
591	Aw, my flattery didn't work? Guess I'll just have to\nkeep at it, then...
592	Next time we have a fight like this, we should try to\nkeep it away from the monastery.
593	Well, there are many factors to keep in mind...\nHuh. It's rare that you have an opinion on warfare.
594	I just don't want to deal with the mess! Cleaning up\nrubble isn't my idea of fun.
595	Lorenz, what's that expression about? Are you\nunhappy about something?
596	I hope you don't think I'm stupid enough to let my\npersonal feelings affect me here.
597	Then don't make weird faces. Keep it together, man!
598	For Claude and I to work together so well is nothing\nshort of a miracle.
599	You really think it's that big of a deal? Well, it all\nended well, and that's the important thing.
600	Considering I had to deal with Claude, it went better\nthan expected.
601	You're right. Anyway, time for me to head out.
602	I will make a worthy opponent, don't you think?
603	Hey, are you suggesting we duel? We're supposed\nto be working together!
604	Wishful thinking. I will take the chance to evaluate\nyour abilities instead.
605	An excellent finish, if I do say so myself... Lorenz,\ndid you take notice of my abilities?
606	Enough to reaffirm my own superiority, yes.
607	I wouldn't say it was regrettable. I'd say we\nwere just...passable.
608	I am not satisfied with my own performance either.\nI suppose I will have to outshine you next time.
609	With you and your excellent skills at my side,\nI can probably slack off a bit.
610	Nonsense. Aren't you supposed to be the one with\nthe superior skills?
611	You only ever appreciate me at times like these.\nWell, let's end this together.
612	Good results. It seems my nipping at Claude's heels\nhas had an effect.
613	And "nipping at my heels" counts as working harder?
614	How unsatisfying. I will simply have to browbeat\nClaude into working harder in the future.
615	Hey... Have you considered a change of direction?
616	If you wanted to invite someone else to dine with us,\nProfessor, I would have preferred you choose a lady.
617	Eh, I don't mind a straitlaced noble joining us.\nI'm happy just to share a meal with Teach.
618	Whenever I eat with you, Lorenz, I always feel like\nI have to mind my manners. It's awful.
619	Good. You should mind your manners even when\nI am not watching. You are a noble, after all.
620	If someday our positions change, we will not have\nmany opportunities to eat together like this.
621	True. That would make this moment a priceless\nmemory... Nah, just kidding. Let's just eat already.
622	
623	
624	
625	
626	
627	
628	It is a privilege to be paired with you, Hilda.
629	I'm not much good at this kinda thing. You'll take\ncare of everything, right, Lorenz?
630	Of course! Leave it all to me. It would not do for\na noble lady such as yourself to suffer distress!
631	You were amazing, Lorenz! I never imagined this\nwould go so well.
632	It was the natural result. What else would you expect\nfrom Lorenz Hellman Gloucester?
633	Oh, Lorenz, done already! You're so amazing. I truly\nadmire you.
634	It was no trouble. Though I admit I was surprised\nto see you actually did leave it all to me...
635	You really know what you're doing! I bet you'll do\na terrific job.
636	For you, Hilda, I will give my best effort.
637	Thanks so much! I'll do my best to support you.
638	Nice job, Lorenz! I knew I could count on you this\ntime. And next time, I hope!
639	I am honored by your praise, but I hope next time\nto see a contribution from you as well...
640	Thank you, Hilda. Your support was essential to\nour success.
641	You're welcome! I'm sure we can do that next time.
642	I am here to support you, Hilda. Just take this at\nyour own pace.
643	My own pace? Hm. Maybe I'll give it a shot.
644	Even the toughest task will seem easy when we\ncombine our efforts!
645	Look, Professor! I did it!
646	Wonderful performance, Hilda. I knew I was right\nto encourage your participation!
647	We fell short, but at least it was fun!
648	To see you enjoy yourself so is ample reward for me.\nThe result is practically irrelevant.
649	I am pleased to dine with such suitable companions.
650	Is there such a thing as an unsuitable\ndinner companion?
651	Nothing like a tasty meal after some grueling work.\nLorenz, you've hardly eaten anything.
652	There is no need to rush. I prefer to take my time.
653	Always happy to join the professor for a meal. Oh,\nand I'm glad you're here too, Lorenz!
654	The pleasure is entirely mine, Hilda.
655	
656	
657	
658	
659	
660	
661	Ugh... I'm to work with Leonie?
662	What's wrong? Can't stomach being paired up with\na commoner?
663	Not at all. But I am concerned about what you will\nmake me do.
664	We did well, didn't we? Lorenz did a great job.
665	It was just as I'd feared. Let us discuss it no further...
666	Our results would've been better if you'd done a\nlittle more, Lorenz.
667	It was a concession to do as much as I did. This type\nof work is utterly beneath someone of my station.
668	You know I won't go easy on you just because you're\na noble, right?
669	Absolutely. Let's share the burden equally‚Äîwe are\nfriends, after all.
670	As long as that's clear. Let's get to it!
671	We did well! You're pretty impressive, Lorenz.
672	The same to you! We deserve equal praise.
673	Strange. I really thought we'd do better than this.
674	Perhaps my overly restrictive mindset is to blame.
675	
676	
677	
678	
679	
680	
681	
682	Could I at least persuade you to eat with utensils?
683	Eyes on your own plate. Don't you know it's\ndisrespectful to waste food?
684	Hey, you're cleaning your plate! Nice job.
685	Please stop. You sound like my mother.
686	
687	
688	Me, of all people, reduced to pulling weeds.\nWhy am I not being given chores more befitting\nof my stature?!
689	Seems to me you shouldn't be trusted with anything\nimportant if you can't even pull weeds properly.
690	Can't pull weeds properly?! That's outrageous! I will\nshow you weed-pulling perfection!
691	This rubble looks awfully heavy. I don't know if we'll\nbe able to move it.
692	Nonsense‚Äîthis will be trivial for me. Feel free to\nrest, stand back, and gaze admiringly.
693	Kind of you to offer, but I think you'll need my help.
694	Ah, Raphael! Um, OK. Here goes.
695	Hey, Ignatz! I'm glad I got partnered up with you!\nYou've got some skills!
696	I'm not sure about that, but I can give it a try...
697	Check it out, Professor! Ignatz pulled it off!
698	No, no, it was all thanks to Raphael.
699	Sorry, Raphael. That didn't go as well as I'd hoped.
700	Why are you apologizing? That was great!\nRight, Professor?
701	Huh. Your muscles are looking a little bigger\nthan usual, Raphael.
702	I've been training since dawn, so they better\nbe bulging!
703	I'm feeling hopeful. Let's put our hearts into it.
704	Look, Professor! Raphael and his muscles really came\nthrough for us.
705	Nah, it's all 'cause of Ignatz's skills. Together\nwe're unstoppable!
706	That was fun, but I guess we coulda done better.
707	As they say, you win some, you lose some. We'll do\nbetter next time.
708	
709	
710	
711	
712	
713	
714	
715	There's more food than I can eat. Professor, Raphael,\nyou're welcome to have some of mine.
716	Don't listen to him, Professor! Ignatz gets all dizzy if\nhe doesn't eat enough!
717	Excuse me, but I gotta go grab me some seconds!
718	Seconds? We only just started eating! How did you\nmagic away your firsts?
719	
720	
721	Hey, Ignatz. Can you do me a favor and tie that big\nol' rock to my back?
722	Figure I should get some training in while we're out\nhere working.
723	Um... I'm not strong enough to pick up that rock and\nput it on your back.
724	I'll take care of the big chunks of rubble if you take\ncare of the little ones, all right, Ignatz?
725	Shouldn't we work together? I don't want to make\nyou do all the heavy lifting.
726	Don't worry about it! I gotta work my\nmuscles somehow!
727	Hello, Marianne.
728	My apologies if I cause you any trouble, Hilda.
729	What trouble? You'll be all right. You look like a\nhard worker.
730	We nailed it! I'm so proud of us.
731	I'm sorry, Hilda. I didn't do any of the hard work...
732	Done! Oof, I'm tired.
733	I'm sorry I wasn't much help...
734	I'm glad I get to work with you...
735	Of course, Marianne. You can always count on your\nold pal Hilda.
736	Thank you. I'll do my best.
737	That was amazing, Hilda!
738	Something about you makes me want to put in effort.\nIt's kinda weird.
739	I'm so sorry, Hilda... I wasn't much help after all.
740	Yeah, but that's OK. I'm used to it. Give me some\ncandy later and we'll call it even.
741	
742	
743	
744	
745	
746	
747	
748	It's...delicious.
749	I know! So tasty. It would be nice if you spoke up\nonce in a while though.
750	Food tastes better when I get to share it with you.
751	I feel the same! Let's fill up so that we feel good\nand energized.
752	
753	
754	
755	
756	
757	
758	
759	
760	So it is you and I, Lysithea? Very well then.\nWith your two Crests...
761	Ugh, Hanneman, would you drop it already?
762	Oh, I beg your pardon. I shall complete the rest\nof the work in silence.
763	Hmm, I wonder if we'd have prevailed without the\nhelp of your two Crests?
764	I told you to drop it. So drop it.
765	All the questioning was bothersome.
766	Hmm? Oh. Yes. Most sorry. At any rate, it seems\nas if our task is at an end.
767	Do not push yourself too hard, Lysithea. Why, you\nmight even leave everything to me, should you wish.
768	I've got this, but thanks. I don't need\nspecial assistance.
769	No, that won't do at all. I heard about your secret,\nyou know.
770	That went well.
771	A direct result of your efforts, Lysithea! Quite a\npleasing result, don't you think?
772	Whew. We got there eventually, thanks to your\nhard work, Lysithea.
773	There's no need to go overboard with the praise.
774	Are you ready, partner? Here we go! Let's show 'em\nwhat we're made of!
775	You are so strange. And drop the "partner," will you?
776	Come now, Lysithea, no need to be so cold. Join me\nin my excitement, see if you don't enjoy it.
777	An exceptional result, partner! Here's to an ever\nbrighter future for Crestology!
778	I am not your partner! And Crestology is irrelevant!\nYou never listen to a word I say! Ugh!
779	That went fine...I guess. We can do better, though.
780	I am most impressed by your unwavering ambition. I\ndo hope you will consider following in my footsteps.
781	Lysithea, do you like this kind of food? How is the\nseasoning? Is it hot enough?
782	Hey. The professor is right here. Can you please stop\npaying me so much attention? Thanks.
783	Professor, I apologize for the uncomfortable\natmosphere between us.
784	Hold on. I'm afraid I am to blame. I apologize for\nmaking it awkward for the two of you.
785	What a company we are! A master of Crestology,\none who aspires, and one who helps people. 
786	Obviously I'm the one who aspires. So that means\nthe professor is the one helping others? Huh.
787	
788	
789	
790	
791	
792	
793	Honestly, this is a bit of a hassle. However, with you,\nMarianne, I suspect it will not be so bad.
794	Oh? Um, why's that?
795	Hm? No reason. Shall we get started?
796	Marianne, you are unusually clumsy. But all turned \nout well in the end... Funny, that.
797	We probably just got lucky. I should go...
798	I'm sorry, Linhardt... I-I wasn't much use...
799	Oh, nonsense. We made it. Isn't that what counts?\nMore than that, I... Ah, I'll tell you next time.
800	Me and Marianne? Well, this should save both time \nand effort.
801	Time and...effort? What does that mean?
802	It lets me be close to you, right? Ah, I just realized\nhow that sounds. Please don't take it the wrong way.
803	Just as I thought‚Äîeverything went smoothly. Having\nyou around really helped things along. Thank you.
804	Yes, it appears that we were lucky.
805	We were neither particularly lucky or unlucky there.\nEverything turned out just as I expected it would.
806	I'm glad we were able to finish while avoiding\na catastrophe.
807	
808	
809	
810	
811	
812	
813	
814	Um, I find it difficult to eat when you stare...
815	My apologies. You and the professor are both so\nfascinating...I simply cannot help myself.
816	Marianne, are you going to finish eating that? May I\nhave it? For research...
817	Please don't say such bizarre things in front of\nthe professor...
818	
819	
820	
821	
822	
823	
824	
825	
826	If there is work to be done, I suppose there are\nworse partners.
827	Can't say I'm looking forward to it, but we gotta do\nwhat we gotta do.
828	Not looking forward to it? Once you see what I can\ndo, you are sure to change your mind.
829	Great work, Lorenz! I'm surprised how much you\ncould do with those scrawny arms of yours!
830	It was a good result. No need for condescension.
831	You've got some scrawny arms, but you did all\nright, Lorenz!
832	It was only due to my precise instructions that we\nsucceeded at all. You should be thanking me!
833	OK, I'll let you be in charge of the thinking. If you\ncan lead, I'll follow!
834	That would be the natural order of things, yes.
835	Natural order? Ha! I only put you in charge 'cause\nyou're too scrawny to be any real help!
836	Not bad! Splitting up the work was a good idea!
837	It was a successful arrangement. Perhaps we are more\ncompatible than I thought.
838	I guess that coulda gone better... At least it was easier\nthan normal, right?
839	Perhaps. But we should aim higher next time.
840	
841	
842	
843	
844	
845	
846	
847	Mmm...delicious! Don't worry about finishing your\nportion. I'll gladly clean it up after you!
848	Could you eat a little more quietly, please?\nYour manners are disgraceful...
849	Dining together is a fine way to socialize. This is a\ngood opportunity to get to know the professor.
850	You're right! Maybe you can ask about their\nfavorite meat!
851	
852	
853	
854	
855	
856	
857	
858	
859	I am with you this time, Brother?
860	No need to worry, Flayn. Simply leave it all to me.
861	Must you always take away all the fun from me?
862	A most satisfactory result. All thanks to you.
863	Thanking me? But you did everything.
864	This was less than ideal. Still, nothing to blame but\nmy own inadequacy.
865	That is because you attempted to do everything\nyourself. Next time, allow me to help!
866	This time, Flayn, I will leave it to you. I promise\nonly to watch and make certain you're safe.
867	It is about time you admitted that I can pull \nmy weight! I will not let you down!
868	Good. Prove to your brother how far you've come!
869	We did splendidly! However, you could not help but\nstep in, despite what you said.
870	Apologies. I had intended only to watch, but I could\nnot help myself.
871	It was certainly a struggle, but we pulled through!
872	You've gotten so strong. I'm proud beyond words!
873	
874	
875	
876	
877	
878	
879	
880	Ah, meals always taste best when it is a company of\nthree or more at the table.
881	Do you not enjoy eating when it's just the two of us?\nYou wound me, Flayn...
882	Having a meal together like this makes me feel like\nyou are part of our family, Professor.
883	You truly are as good as kin. Let us enjoy this brief\nrespite together.
884	
885	
886	
887	
888	
889	I will carry the bigger pieces, Flayn. You collect\nanything...smaller than your fist.
890	Surely I am capable of carrying something the size\nof two fists... Please, Brother?
891	Please don't. If you dropped something heavy on\nyour foot, I would never forgive myself.
892	My, Manuela, you seem to be in good spirits today.
893	Perhaps I'll work with you? Seems you might be\nup to the task, hmm?
894	That's rude, Hanneman. And I could do this\nquicker on my own, but I suppose I'll humor you.
895	I think that went pretty well. But that was all me,\nHanneman.
896	Indeed! We've still got it. Not going to fall behind\nthe youngsters just yet!
897	That was all fine and well. However, Manuela, more\neffort on your behalf would not go unappreciated.
898	Oh, I did plenty. Don't blame me because you're\ngetting slow in your old age.
899	You? Ugh. All right, I suppose I'll do what I'm told.\nBut I'm not the least bit happy about it.
900	Manuela, we have discussed your rudeness on prior\noccasions. One would think you'd learn politeness.
901	Yes, well, sorry to let you down. Let's skip the\ndiscussion this time though. We have things to do.
902	I had no faith in a positive result, but we have\nachieved just that.
903	Huh. We did, didn't we? I suppose competing with\neach other gets results.
904	Look, Hanneman. All your faffing about landed us a\nmediocre result. What a complete waste of time.
905	I accomplished my duties well enough. Perhaps the\nproblem is your bad behavior?
906	Manuela, I have an observation. When we quarrel,\nthings that would otherwise go well, do not go well.
907	What a coincidence. I was just thinking the same\nthing.
908	Then you know what I'm going to say next.\nLet's‚Äîthe two of us‚Äîbury the hatchet, and\nperform our duty.
909	When we work properly together and avoid\nbickering, we're successful.
910	Just as you say. Let us avoid arguments as much as\npossible, and do what it is we've set out to do.
911	Hey, Hanneman! I thought we were supposed to\nbury the hatchet.
912	You're the one who buried the hatchet, woman. In\nmy back! I did my level best to keep things going.
913	This is lovely. I welcome an opportunity for us three\nto get together and enjoy one another's company.
914	I wouldn't normally want you around for dinner,\nHanneman. But it's kinda nice once in a while.
915	My apologies in advance for our boisterous dining\ncompanion, Professor.
916	Professor, please allow me to apologize for the\nunprofessional behavior of my colleague.
917	Ahh, I love mealtimes. No nagging, or self-important\njabbering coming out of that loud mouth.
918	And whose mouth would that be, Manuela?\nOr are you speaking only for yourself?
919	I know it's tradition for inhabitants of a monastery to\nwork, but weeding? Ugh. My poor back.
920	Likely, your trouble is an unhealthy lifestyle. Though\nmy back hurts as well, and there's no explaining that.
921	Yours hurts because you're old. Ugh, let's stop this.\nIt's just going to make both of us sad if we keep on.
922	I can't just cart rubble around all day, but I'll help as\nmuch as I can.
923	Seems like there's always more to clean, but Garreg\nMach is too important to leave under all this mess.
924	Hmm. Agreed. Let's combine our forces and get \nto it, then.
925	You and me, Shamir. Let's do this, quick and easy.
926	Prepare yourself, Catherine. You'll fail if you\nunderestimate the work.
927	That may be true. When I work with you, though,\nI never fail.
928	An excellent outcome. It's easy to work with\nyou, partner.
929	We make a pretty good team, huh?
930	I was careless, like you said. Sorry.
931	Don't worry about it. We finished what was assigned.
932	Something wrong, partner?
933	Oh, nothing. I was just wondering how long we'll\nbe able to work together like this.
934	Hah! So sentimental. We can't know the future until\nit arrives.
935	We put on quite a show, huh? The two top fighters\nof the Knights of Seiros, working together!
936	I appreciate your enthusiasm, but save it for\nthe battlefield.
937	I suppose we're done here, partner.
938	Yes. I think we'll do better next time.
939	
940	
941	
942	
943	
944	
945	
946	It's too rare that we get a chance to kick back and\nstuff our faces. C'mon Shamir, time to gorge!
947	I apologize for my partner, Professor.
948	Eating with the two of you makes me feel at home.
949	At home, hm? Hah. That's a nice feeling...
950	
951	
952	Here we are, two proud knights, pulling up weeds. \nWhy can't I just use Thunderbrand to zap 'em?
953	A weed must be cut at its root, just like tyranny\nand vice.
954	Yikes. Never mind. You're no fun at all.
955	Working through the rubble does not bother me. It's\na job that must be done.
956	It does bother me. I hate to see Garreg Mach in\nsuch a state. We must rebuild.
957	If that's how you feel, then I will do my best.
958	What do you think, Cyril? Will this be a problem?
959	Nah, gonna get this finished up real quick.
960	Right. Shouldn't be difficult working together. Let's\nget to it.
961	All done. I didn't figure we'd have much trouble.
962	Perfect. Nice work.
963	Aw, that didn't go the way I'd planned it to.
964	There's always room for improvement. Let's focus\nmore next time.
965	It'll be done in no time...if we work together that is.
966	Agreed. You're in charge, Cyril.
967	You got it. Let's begin right away.
968	Good work, Cyril. Your directions were impeccable.
969	Miss Shamir, did you just...praise me? Wow!\nThat makes my day a whole lot better.
970	Thank you for directing us, Cyril. How do you think\nit went?
971	Ugh, I coulda done better. I gotta try harder\nnext time.
972	
973	
974	
975	
976	
977	
978	
979	Having a meal together with Shamir... I'm happy and\nmore than a bit nervous.
980	Hah. It's rude to ignore the professor like that.
981	Your table manners are the one truly adult aspect\nabout you, Cyril.
982	Just one, huh? I hope I can get more aspects\nreal soon.
983

1019	I know a lot about plants too. You might as well\ncall me Botanical Bernie!
1020	That gives me surprise. I will be relying on you,\nBotanical Bernie!
1021	Removing rubble... I will be devoting myself to this\ntask as long as I have strength to be sparing!
1022	Wow. Um, I think I'll just stand back and cheer for\nyou, Petra. This isn't a job for me, anyway...
1023	There is no use in arguing. I will not be letting you\nget away!

1051	Just a few weeds. I don't see the big deal.
1052	Don't underestimate weeds. They can swallow\na whole building before you know it.
1053	That's unbelievable. That's literally unbelievable.
1054	Oof... There's a lot more rubble than I thought.\nI'm going to be sore tonight...
1055	We just started and you're already whining.\nYou really think you can be a knight?
1056	When you say it like that, I've got no choice but to\ngive it everything I've got!

1084	Marianne. I hear you are quite clumsy, but do you\nthink you could manage a bit of weeding?
1085	Just pulling up weeds? I can try. I'll start over there...
1086	Please do... No, wait! Those are incredibly\nprecious vegetables!
1087	We can't take on the big ones, but we should at\nleast be able to clear out some of the smaller ones.
1088	Dorte is big and strong... I bet he could carry this\nrubble. I'll go to the stable and ask him.
1089	Stable? Wait, is Dorte...a horse? Your plan is to ask\na horse?!
3/0
1	I hope you've had a chance to meet everyone.\nWould you like to know more about any of the\nBlack Eagles?
2	Me? Well...some think I'm a bit distant. Arrogant,\neven. But there's little to be done. One day, I must\nrise to become Adrestia's next emperor.
3	What else... Well, it seems to me that we may have\nsimilar personalities.
4	Hubert is the heir of Marquis Vestra. He has served\nme since I was a child.
5	You may think his blood runs a bit cold, but... Heh,\nactually, that's rather accurate. Still, if you can get\npast that, you'll see he's quite astute and reasonable.
6	For some reason, he thinks of me as a bitter\nrival and is always trying to challenge me.\nIt's terribly irritating.
7	His house is that of Duke Aegir, which produces\nAdrestia's Prime Ministers. That family is...perhaps\ntoo pleased with its own status.
8	He's remarkably intelligent, but he only wishes to\napply himself to tasks that particularly interest him\nand nothing else. He's also fond of...well, napping.
9	If he had any work ethic or sense of duty to speak of,\nI suppose he would be destined to become an official\nof the Empire.
10	He's the second son of Count Bergliez. He has no\ninheritance in his future, which is perhaps why he's\nalways so eager to prove himself.
11	He's overly energetic and rushes headfirst into any\nbattle. If he ends up in your care, be sure to keep a\nclose eye on him.
12	She's Count Varley's only daughter. I suppose you\ncould say she's a bit eccentric, but she seems like a\ngentle soul.
13	I believe she's shut herself away in her quarters and\ndoesn't care to leave, but...don't worry. I'll make\nsure she finds her way to class.
14	Few commoners have joined the Black Eagle House,\nbut Dorothea is an exception.
15	She's a songstress from a famous opera company in\nthe Empire. I'm not entirely sure what brought her\nto the Officers Academy.
16	To the west of F√≥dlan is an archipelago called Brigid.\nPetra is the granddaughter of their king.
17	Brigid is a vassal state of the Empire, which is how\nshe came to be enrolled here. She's incredibly smart\nand studious.
18	I hear you're investigating the different houses here.\nDid any of the Blue Lions catch your attention?
19	Me? Oh. Um. Please forgive me... It's difficult to\nopen up on the spot, don't you think?
20	I'm afraid my story has not been a pleasant one...\nI do hope that doesn't color your view of me, but\nI understand if that can't be helped.
21	Dedue was born in Duscur, and has been loyally\nworking in my service for the past four years.
22	He's rather taciturn, but once you get to know him,\nyou'll see he's a kind and good-natured young man.
23	Felix is the heir to House Fraldarius. He has a bit\nof a sharp tongue, but don't let that fool you.\nDeep down, he's a good guy.
24	He gravitates toward people who are skilled.\nPerhaps you would enjoy a friendly competition\nwith him sometime.
25	He's the adoptive son of Lord Lonato of Castle\nGaspard, but I hear he was born a commoner.
26	He has an extremely earnest personality, so I'm\ncertain he will approach your lectures with\ngreat enthusiasm.
27	Sylvain is the heir to House Gautier. He is a capable\nperson who highly values his friends. That said...
28	Well, he's always been a bit of a...ahem, skirt chaser,\nso to speak. Pardon my bluntness. I speak with him\nabout it often, but it doesn't seem to help.
29	I hear she was born to Imperial nobility, but a twist\nof fate brought her to the Kingdom.
30	She may seem carefree on the surface, but she's\nactually a kind soul who pays careful attention\nto everyone around her.
31	Annette is Baron Dominic's niece. She is a talented\nstudent who scored extremely high marks at the\nRoyal School of Sorcery.
32	She's cheerful and hardworking. Brilliant, really.\nThough she can be a bit oblivious at times. I hear\nshe caused an explosion in the kitchen last night...
33	Ingrid is Count Galatea's daughter. She is also a\nchildhood friend of Felix, Sylvain, and myself.
34	She is diligent, industrious, and principled.\nIn truth, she is more knightly than most\nknights you will ever meet.
35	Have you met the folks from the Golden Deer House\nyet? Care to know more about anyone?
36	Piqued your interest, have I? As luck would\nhave it, I'm pretty curious about you as well.
37	But what's life without a bit of mystery? Let's just\nspend the next year or so learning about each other,\nlittle by little.
38	He's the heir of Gloucester territory. If you haven't\nalready picked up on it, he's a bit arrogant and\nfancies himself a lady's man.
39	That said, deep down he's really devoted and\nhonest... Though I wouldn't mind never hearing\nhim talk about his noble obligations ever again.
40	He comes from a merchant family, but his parents\ndied in an accident. Seems like he's had a rough life.
41	Despite all that, he's just about the most cheerful\nguy you'll ever meet. His passions are training,\neating, and... Actually, that's about it.
42	He's the second son of a merchant family. Since his\nbrother will inherit the business, he's training to\nbecome a knight.
43	If you ask me, doesn't seem like he truly wants to\nbe a knight... He's probably just doing it to please\nhis parents.
44	Lysithea is the daughter of Count Ordelia, and is\nprobably the youngest student here.
45	But watch out! She gets angry if you treat her like a\nchild. As for me, I do it on purpose. You have to\nmake your own fun in this place, you know?
46	Marianne is Margrave Edmund's daughter...\nand that's pretty much all I know about her.
47	She doesn't interact much with other students,\nso I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of folks here\nhave never even heard her speak.
48	Hilda is the only daughter of Duke Goneril. It seems\nher father and brother coddle her quite a bit.
49	If you look up "lazy" in the dictionary...her picture\nwon't be there because she never got around to\nsubmitting it. Not too unusual for a noble, I guess.
50	Leonie enrolled because she wants to be a mercenary.\nI think she said that her father is a hunter.
51	She's pretty blunt and as stingy as they come.\nA habitual saver, too. I think she's hoping to repay\nher village for helping to send her here.
52	You look as if you have no idea what's going on here.\nI know my way around, so I'm happy to help you\nfind your footing.
53	The monastery has some exceptional facilities that\neveryone who lives at the Officers Academy is\nwelcome to make use of.
54	For example, you can enjoy a meal with your\nstudents at the dining hall or take part in some\none-on-one sparring at the training grounds.
55	I suggest visiting the various facilities whenever you\nhave the time to spare. It's a great way to get to know\nthe students, faculty, and various workers here.
56	Have you noticed the bulletin boards placed around\nthe monastery?
57	Those contain requests people have posted, as well\nas helpful information from the market.
58	If you prove yourself by helping people with their\nrequests, certain facilities here will become available\nfor your use.
59	The bulletin board is updated frequently, so I\nsuggest checking it at least once a month.
60	You should take your time when speaking with\neveryone, but when it comes to using the facilities...\nWell, you need to be more careful about that.
61	If you use them without planning ahead, your free\ntime will be gone before you know it.
62	A great deal is expected from professors of the\nOfficers Academy, so it's important to hone\nyour skills.
63	To put it plainly, you'll need to keep expanding your\nknowledge of all disciplines, not just battle.
64	Just as students have much to learn from other\nstudents, professors can also share their knowledge\nwith each other.
65	You should consider seeking instruction from\nProfessor Hanneman or Professor Manuela. I think\nyou'll find their insight quite interesting.
66	Which house a student is assigned to depends on\nwhere they're from. That said, each professor has\ntheir own area of expertise.
67	So if a student is adamant about it, it is possible\nto switch someone from one house to another.\nPending your approval, of course.
68	Have you not been told what's expected from\nlectures here? Well, I can tell you how it works\nbased on what I've heard from other professors.
69	Before starting a lecture, it's a good idea to\ndetermine everyone's academic goals.
70	Students will want to prioritize studying things that\nwill help them achieve their aim.
71	It's probably easier to get good results if you instruct\nstudents based on their interests and specialties.
72	Of course, that doesn't mean it's pointless to teach\nsomeone things unrelated to their personal goals\nas well.
73	By looking beyond their preferences, some students\nmay find they're interested in fields they've never\npreviously considered.
74	A student's goals may change based on their studies\nor the experience they gain while on missions.
75	When that happens, perhaps you could help\nthem decide what new goals they should set\nfor themselves.
76	How motivated a student is will affect how well your\ntutoring goes.
77	To help cultivate their motivation, I think it's a\ngood idea to interact with your students as much\nas possible.
78	Please try your best to motivate everyone so that\nthey, in turn, will try hard with their assignments\nand activities.
79	At the Officers Academy, students are encouraged\nto engage in various activities in and around\nthe monastery.
80	If you instruct your students to work together as\na team, it will help to deepen their bonds and\nproduce better results.
81	Have you heard about the certification exams?\nThey take place every month.
82	Everyone here is working hard to become a certain\ntype of soldier, and those tests are how you can\ncheck to see how far we've come.
83	In order to pass the exam, you need to train enough\nto become whatever class you're aiming for.
84	Take care to develop your students strategically so\nthat they can pass their certification exams.
85	In battle, it's necessary to deploy battalions so that\nstudents can experience taking command.
86	I doubt I need to say this to a mercenary like you,\nbut if you have any questions about how to use your\nsoldiers, please, don't hesitate to ask.
87	After you hire a battalion, you'll need to decide who\nwill lead them.
88	Battalions can contain soldiers like mages and monks\nwho don't fight with weapons.
89	Be sure to think carefully about who would benefit\nmost from the support of battalion soldiers and their\nspecific skills.
90	Naturally, battalions lose endurance as they fight.
91	If you visit the battalion guild in the market, you'll\nbe able to replenish their endurance.
92	In the battalion guild, you can find various\nbattalions that aren't affiliated with the\nChurch of Seiros.
93	We're allowed to hire them if we so please, so you\nshould familiarize yourself with the guild whenever\nyou have the chance.
94	When you deploy a battalion, you can utilize its\nspecial gambit in battle.
95	If a gambit is successful, your enemy will be\nseverely shaken.
96	Joining forces with a nearby ally is a surefire way\nto enhance your effectiveness.
97	As this is your first time at the monastery,\nplease allow me to show you the ropes.
98	Both students and teachers of the Officers Academy\nare free use the facilities within the monastery.
99	For example, you can dine with others at the\ndining hall or partake in one-on-one combat\nat the training grounds.
100	I encourage you to wander around the monastery\nand lend an ear to the people living here.
101	There are bulletin boards in various places around\nthe monastery. Have you seen them, Professor?
102	There you can find requests from various sources,\nas well as information about the market.
103	If you fulfill these requests, you should eventually\nbe able to use even more of the facilities here.
104	The bulletin board gets updated frequently.\nYou would do well to check it once a month.
105	This probably goes without saying, but no matter\nwhich facility you use, it will take up a considerable\namount of your time.
106	It's helpful to plan out activities in advance so that\nyou don't mistakenly squander your time here.
107	Professors at the Officers Academy are expected\nto have exceptional leadership skills.
108	Students and teachers alike must devote themselves\nto their studies and strive to acquire great wisdom,\neven outside their respective fields.
109	Just as students receive guidance from professors,\nprofessors may also guide each other.
110	If you're interested, you should seek out Professor\nHanneman or Professor Manuela.
111	A student's house is determined by their place of\norigin, but naturally, each individual has their own\naptitudes and interests.
112	That said, if a student so desires and their current\nprofessor consents, they may transfer from one\nhouse to another.
113	If you don't yet know the proper procedure for\nlectures, I will tell you all that I know. Assuming\nthat's agreeable to you, of course.
114	Before beginning a lecture, we would be most\nappreciative if you would first make note of our\nstudy goals.
115	After all, everyone wishes to prioritize studying fields\nrelated to their goals, right?
116	I believe you can ensure better results by instructing\nindividuals based on their interests and specialties.
117	Of course, that doesn't mean it's pointless to teach\nsomeone things unrelated to their goals.
118	You never know if a student will develop an interest\nin something by overcoming their distaste for it.
119	Everyone's study goals will likely change based on\nthe experience they receive from future instruction\nor assignments.
120	When that happens, it would be greatly beneficial\nif you could advise us as to what new goals we\nshould set for ourselves.
121	No matter how passionate you are about tutoring\nsomeone, it's difficult to get good results if that\nstudent lacks motivation.
122	To increase a student's motivation, it's probably best\nto appeal to them in a variety of ways.
123	If it's not too much trouble, I would be grateful\nif you would try to pay attention to everyone's\nmotivation level.
124	Students are encouraged to engage in various\nactivities in and around the monastery.
125	By working together, students can strengthen their\nrelationships and, in time, achieve better results\nmore readily.
126	Have you heard? Certification exams are held every\nmonth at the Officers Academy.
127	To become a new class, one must first overcome the\ncertification exam for that class.
128	Needless to say, if one lacks the required abilities,\npassing will prove difficult.
129	I hope that you will plan ahead for the certification\nexams and instruct everyone accordingly.
130	Students command battalions in battle in order to\nexperience taking command.
131	Do you have experience commanding a battalion,\nProfessor? I assume so, but if not, I'm happy\nto explain.
132	When you employ a battalion, first decide who will\nlead them.
133	Not all battalions are comprised of soldiers wielding\nweapons. Some contain mages or monks.
134	Once you've ascertained the characteristics of each\nbattalion, you must think carefully about who will\ncommand them.
135	As they fight, battalions will lose endurance.
136	When that happens, you can replenish their\nendurance by visiting the battalion guild in\nthe market.
137	Battalions from various territories gather at the\nGuild. There are even some that aren't affiliated\nwith the Church of Seiros.
138	As we are allowed to hire them, you should visit\nthe Guild soon and come to your own conclusions.
139	If you deploy a battalion, you will be able to utilize\ntheir special gambit in battle.
140	If your gambit attack is successful, it can cause\nunrest among your enemies.
141	If you team up with a nearby ally, the ensuing results\nmay be quite remarkable.
142	You know, I was researching what it's like to live\nhere long before I even enrolled. Want me to fill\nyou in, Teach?
143	Students and teachers of the Officers Academy are\nall free to use the facilities within the monastery.
144	That means you can chow down with students at\nthe dining hall, or get in some one-on-one sparring\nat the training grounds.
145	As you explore the monastery, try visiting the various\nfacilities and talking to the people who live here.
146	If you haven't noticed, there are bulletin boards in\nvarious places around here.
147	You can check them out to see posted requests or to\nfind more information about the market.
148	I hear that fulfilling requests can even earn you the\nright to use more facilities.
149	The bulletin board gets updated frequently, so it's\nprobably a good idea to check it once a month.
150	Far be it for me to tell you how to use the facilities,\nbut it's a good idea to be mindful of how you're using\nyour time.
151	If you don't think about how you're spending your\nfree time, it'll be over before you know it.
152	Here at the Officers Academy, even professors\nare expected to study often to help maintain their\nstrong leadership skills.
153	In other words, students and teachers alike have to\nstrive to grow in every possible field.
154	Students aren't the only ones who have something to\nlearn from their professors. Professors can also learn\nfrom each other.
155	If you want to, you should try trading knowledge\nwith Professor Hanneman or Professor Manuela.
156	The house a student belongs to is determined by\nwhere they're from, but it is possible for someone\nto switch to a different one.
157	Of course, that's only if the student very strongly\nwants to make the change and their professor\nis on board with it.
158	Don't tell me... No one bothered to show you the\nstandard procedure for lectures? I guess it's up\nto me to save the day.
159	Before starting a lecture, be sure to first check on\nour study goals.
160	After all, students will want to prioritize studying\nthings that relate to their goals.
161	It's probably easier to get good results if you instruct\nstudents based on their interests and specialties.
162	But that doesn't mean it's pointless to teach things that\ndon't relate to someone's goals. Not by a long shot.
163	By overcoming their weaknesses, some students\nmay develop an interest in new fields.
164	A student's study goals may need to be updated\nbased on their learnings and experiences.
165	It's an important part of being Teach to counsel\nstudents like that.
166	How well their tutoring goes will depend on\na student's motivation.
167	It's possible that interacting with students on a\nregular basis will raise their motivation. Maybe.\nThen again, what do I know?
168	In any case, make sure to keep an eye on how\nmotivated everyone is.
169	Students are encouraged to partake in various\nactivities around the monastery.
170	If you have students work together, it will give them\na chance to interact, and maybe even help them\nachieve better results.
171	Have you heard about the monthly\ncertification exams?
172	If you want to become a certain class, you have to\npass the certification exam for it.
173	That means training up on the required skills\nso you can pass.
174	Don't slack when it comes to teaching your\nstudents what they need to know to pass their\ncertification exams.
175	Battalions are deployed in battle so students can\nlearn how to take command.
176	Oh, that concept may be new to a loner mercenary\nlike you, eh, Teach? Want me to explain the basics?
177	When hiring a battalion, start by deciding who will\nlead them.
178	Pay close attention to the battalion type. One may be\nmade up of armed soldiers while another is all mages.
179	As for who should lead which battalion...\nWell, be sure to think on that carefully.
180	Naturally, battalions will lose endurance as\nthey fight.
181	You can replenish battalion endurance by visiting the\nbattalion guild in the market.
182	At the battalion guild, you can meet battalions\nthat aren't affiliated with the Church of Seiros.
183	We're allowed to hire those folks, too, so be sure to\nvisit the guild later to check it out.
184	If you deploy a battalion, you can use their\nspecial gambit.
185	If you successfully pull off a gambit, you may be able\nto affect the outcome of the battle, even if just a\ntiny bit.
186	If you join forces with a nearby ally, there's a good\nchance that the results will be even greater.
187	With each moon, professors of the Officers Academy\nreceive a schedule for the month ahead.
188	It notes the days on which events and missions\nwill take place that month.
189	Pay careful attention to your schedule so that you\nmay thoughtfully plan what you intend to do\neach month, and when.
190	So, we are taking children into battle, are we? I am\nnot certain I will be able to sleep soundly after\nbeholding something like that...
191	I shall allow you to turn back the hands of time,\nbut know this power is not infinite!
192	Oh my. Is this your first time fighting such a thing?\nThen listen well to what I say.
193	An evil power has caused them to grow quite large.\nTheir life force is beyond a mortal like yourself.
194	You cannot win unless you fell them twice or\neven thrice!
195	Even if you've cornered one, you cannot let your\nguard down! Those things are even worse\nwhen threatened.
196	Can you see that barrier? It is surrounded by great\npower. You must break through to fight that thing.
197	A strong attack or gambit might help to break\nthrough more quickly.
198	If you can break the barrier, that power will have\nnowhere else to go, and that will likely cause\nconfusion for that thing.
199	It cannot counter while confused, which means that\nis the best time to attack!
200	It will not be confused for long, but every moment\nthat it cannot counter is a gift!
201	They have such might that they will not fear you\nalone. But a battalion could prove useful on\nthat front...
202	Attack them with a gambit to draw their attention\nand force them to target you.
203	Be on your guard when they have realized their full\npower! The damage caused at times like that is not\ncontained to just one spot.
204	Once they have charged some power up,\ntheir barriers will be restored. You really must\npay close attention to those things!
205	Distract them with a gambit, or just take them down\nbefore they can attack. In any case, think carefully\nbefore you act!
206	If you break down all of their barriers, not only will\nthey be confused, they will not be able to move\nfor a short while.
207	Without the power flowing around them, they will\nnot be able to restore their barriers. You might even\nbe able to get something from them.
208	But you should be conquering that thing instead of\ntalking to me! If you're out of questions, get over\nthere and fight!
209	If you become closer with the students by partaking\nin the various activities around the monastery, you'll\nbe able to talk to them about such things.
210	Is there anything else you wish to ask me about,\nregarding spending your time at the monastery\nor battles?
211	If you get to know the students better through the\nactivities at the monastery, they may approach you\nabout this.
212	Do you have any other questions about life at the\nmonastery or about battle?
213	If you do a lot of different activities around the\nmonastery, you'll get closer to students and they\nmay ask you about it.
214	Is there anything else you want to ask me, Teach?\nAbout living at the monastery or combat,\nanything like that?

401	If your line breaks, the fish will escape. Durability of the fishing line\nincreases with professor level.
402	Repeated excellent timing will create combos that reduce the fish's\nstamina quickly. If you land excellent timing at all opportunities,\nyou will net a more valuable fish than usual.

415	Spirits that appear in this shade indicate an area where many enemy units\nhave fallen. You can collect items that were dropped by the vanquished.
416	Spirits that appear in this shade indicate an area where many allied units\nwere lost. They can impart blessings such as experience or restored\nequipment durability.
417	A weapon will break when repeated use brings its durability to 0.\nYou can fight with a broken weapon, but your might (Mt) and hit rate\nwill be reduced, and enemies will make follow-up attacks more easily.\nBe careful with your weapons‚Äîyou cannot repair them mid-battle.
418	Chests and doors can be unlocked with the appropriate keys. Move the\nunit with the key next to the chest or door, and they will have the option\nto unlock it.
419	Once you reach Professor Level C, you can assign an adjutant to follow\na unit into battle. The number of adjutants you can assign per battle\nincreases with your professor level.
420	Depending on class, adjutants can provide one of three types of aid:\n‚Ä¢ Follow-up: Occasionally adds a follow-up attack in combat.\n‚Ä¢ Guard: Defends against and reduces damage from follow-up attacks.\n‚Ä¢ Heal: Occasionally heals the host unit at the start of a turn.
421	Select the Items option to change your equipped weapon or to use items\nsuch as the vulnerary, which restores your unit's hit points (HP).
422	Magic can provide new means of attack and defense to a unit that has\nthe skill and is of an appropriate class.
423	You must equip attack magic in place of a weapon, but you can use assist\nmagic regardless of your other equipment. All magic has limited uses,\nbut these will replenish at the end of a battle.
424	The magic your units gain access to is determined by their skills. Study\nreason to learn black or dark magic. Develop faith to learn white magic.
425	On battlefields with thick fog, your units will only be able to see enemies\nthat are close by. Proceed with caution: a unit's movement will be cut\nshort if it is interrupted by an enemy.
426	Units hit by gambits will be rattled. Rattled units cannot move, use\ngambits, or benefit from battalions, and suffer a 10% penalty to all stats.
427	When a gambit is used on an enemy within the attack range of one or\nmore of your other units, it will become a Gambit Boost. The might (Mt)\nand hit rate of the gambit will increase based on the number of units\nparticipating and their support levels.
428	Units with the Locktouch ability can open chests and doors without keys.
429	Adjutants are more effective at higher support levels. They get experience\nin battle, but do not lose weapon durability and do not die if the host unit\nis defeated.

481	Use the battle menu to create bookmark saves, view tutorial guides, and\nmore. To access it, press the A Button when the cursor is on a space\nwithout an active unit.
482	To move your units, select them with the A Button. Then select your\ndestination from among the blue tiles, press the A Button again,\nand your unit will move to the selected tile.
483	After moving, you will see a list of possible unit commands. To end your\nunit's action, select Wait. To cancel, press the B Button.

485	To start combat, first select one of your units using the A Button.\nThen select an enemy within the attack range highlighted in red.
486	Bows can attack from long range, although their hit rate is reduced as\nrange increases. They are highly effective against fliers like pegasus\nknights and wyvern riders.
487	
488	Combat arts are powerful techniques that use more weapon durability\nthan usual. They do not typically allow for follow-up attacks.
489	The Combat Forecast will be shown before you commit to an attack.\nIf the attack speed (AS) of one unit is greater than the other's by 4\nor more, the faster unit will strike twice. This is indicated by a "x2"\nnext to the attack's might (Mt).
490	If your weapon or magic is particularly effective against the enemy's type,\nyou will inflict triple the weapon or magic's might (Mt) in damage.
491	Some combat arts gain bonus damage against certain types of enemies.\nIn these cases, the damage will be double the weapon's might (Mt).
492	Cavalry and fliers have the Canto ability, which allows them to use their\nremaining movement (Mv) after taking certain actions.
493	Some weapons and combat arts inflict status effects, such as lowered stats\nor poison. Different status effects have different durations.
494	All status effects expire naturally, but you can also recover from them\nearlier by using items like antitoxins or white magic such as Restore.
495	In Casual Mode, units whose hit points (HP) are reduced to 0 retreat\nfrom battle and return afterward. In Classic Mode, they are lost forever.
496	If S0's hit points (HP) are reduced to 0 in Classic Mode,\nthe game is over. In Casual Mode, it only ends if your army is defeated.
497	To restore a unit's hit points (HP), use an item like a vulnerary or white\nmagic such as Heal.
498	Units standing on restorative terrain, like heal tiles and strongholds,\nwill restore hit points (HP) at the start of the turn.
499	If you place two of your units adjacent to one another, they will be able\nto use the Trade command to swap items.

4/0
1	Forgive me, everyone. My battle ends here.
2	Forgive me, everyone. My battle ends here.
3	To be left behind... Unacceptable.
4	I have no choice but to admit defeat.
5	I didn't expect that... We'll call it a stalemate.
6	Rendered useless... Lady Edelgard...forgive me.
7	So shameful. How could I...fall like this?
8	Perhaps it's time for a nice nap...
9	What? I lost? Not me. Never me...
10	Oh, Bernie... You're really not cut out for this.
11	Damn it! Not here... I can't quit now.
12	I did not grab the victory. I must retreat now.
13	I've failed... Apologies, Your Highness. I could not\nfulfill my duty.
14	Can't move. Can't lift my weapon any longer.
15	Maybe I'm not...cut out for this.
16	I can't believe it... Well, not much more I can\ndo here.
17	I...I don't think I can keep fighting.
18	Wasn't I...strong enough?
19	Forgive me. Inexperience got the best of me.
20	Impossible... How could I lose?
21	Huh! There go the knees...
22	I'm sorry, everyone. It was just too much.
23	How vexing... This isn't what I wanted.
24	I'm sorry. I wasn't able to help.
25	Guess that's it for me. I'll just go rest up\nor...something.
26	Damn! I'm letting the captain down.
27	
28	I must call it a day...
29	I must fall back. My research cannot end here.
30	I won't forget this. You can count on that.
31	I have yet to be forgiven... For now, I must retreat.
32	I have failed. Forgive me, but...I must pull back.
33	Forced me to retreat, huh? You'll get yours.
34	Didn't earn my keep...
35	I can't let Lady Rhea down. I just need to get\na bit stronger...
36	Damn... Am I losing my edge?
37	How can this be?
38	You shall not be forgiven!

304	I must keep aiming higher.
305	Progress suits me well.
306	Any experience is worth having.
307	Always getting stronger.
308	I think I'm improving.
309	Pretty good, don't ya think?
310	Whoa, did I get stronger?
311	I want to be all I can.
312	Hard work created this.
313	I will handle whatever comes.
314	Stronger, huh? We'll see.
315	I'll stick with it.
316	This is what a real man looks like.
317	I feel more...powerful!
318	Feeling stronger.
319	Have I improved some?
320	I am still not satisfied.
321	I think I've gotten stronger.
322	I feel like I've grown.
323	There's still a long way to go.
324	I guess I feel a little stronger.
325	Don't expect much more than that.
326	Gotta keep improving.
327	Haven't withered away just yet.
328	I am maturing at a rapid pace.
329	I'm only getting better with age.
330	More polish never hurts.
331	Ah, still had room to grow.
332	Haa, more! Ahem. Good.
333	I'm stronger!
334	I'll grow as strong as I can.
335	Feel like I grew up a little.
336	Even I have room to grow.
337	I have ascended.

405	I expected as much.
406	This strength will serve Lady Edelgard well!
407	The noble standard.
408	If only my research had such results.
409	Now I can do so much better!
410	I guess hard work does pay off.
411	Growth is a part of life.
412	War feeds my body and mind.
413	I suppose I've improved.
414	I can feel the difference.
415	I'm starting to see results.
416	I like how this feels.
417	I won't let everyone down.
418	A change for the better.
419	I will get stronger still.
420	Nobles must be strong.
421	Still got room to grow.
422	I'm getting better.
423	I have to try harder.
424	I wonder how much more I can learn.
425	I'm still a delicate flower, you know.
426	Can't get comfortable.
427	Had I room to grow?
428	They say experience feeds growth.
429	There is much to learn from battle.
430	Getting stronger all the time.
431	Maybe I'm not a total waste.
432	Still room to improve.
433	The better to serve Lady Rhea.
434	Strength is all for a mercenary.
435	I feel...stronger.
436	Guess I'm not done yet.

505	I'm not done yet.
506	I still have a long way to go.
507	Greatness awaits me.
508	It's simple logic.
509	I'm just gettin' started!
510	I can improve too, you know.
511	Well? Like what you see?
512	I am greater now.
513	The better to serve His Highness.
514	I have improved.
515	I have so far left to go.
516	Guess I've gotten better.
517	You can rely on me.
518	Everyone will be so pleased!
519	My technique could use some polish.
520	I am still far from my best.
521	Making my muscles proud.
522	I'll try even harder next time.
523	My efforts are paying off.
524	Is this power really mine?
525	I think... Yeah. I'm definitely tougher.
526	I'm aiming high.
527	I can feel it in my bones.
528	I feel my strength building.
529	I could go another few rounds.
530	I can still shine brighter.
531	Reminds me of my youth.
532	Growing stronger suits me.
533	Just let me at 'em.
534	This'll make the job easier.
535	I'll keep it up.
536	Even at my age...

624	Um... Oh well.
625	Oh dear. Maybe I was too lazy.
626	Can I get a do-over?
627	My age is catching up to me.
628	A bit disappointing...
629	This wouldn't have happened in my youth.
630	I'm not at my best today...
631	Age takes its toll.
632	Ugh, that's an embarrassment.
633	Even I have bad days.
634	Not what I was hoping for.

702	I've finally realized my potential.
703	Have I reached the limit?
704	I never thought I'd achieve such strength.
705	I think I'm finally at my best.
706	I believe I've grown all I can.
707	I admire my ability to come so far.
708	I'm done now, right?
709	Does this mean I'm the best?
710	I feel...powerful!
711	I think I've outdone myself!
712	A limit? I will not be accepting of this!
713	Is this my limit?
714	I've reached the peak.
715	I guess I've reached my limits.
716	It'll be hard to top this.
717	When did I get so strong?
718	I worked hard for this.
719	I've come so far.
720	Perfection.
721	Is this as big as I get?
722	Guess I've done all I can.
723	I've finally made it!
724	I probably won't get any better.
725	Well, I've gone about as far as I can.
726	This is it for me?
727	Have I regained my true power?
728	My potential has been reached!
729	The apex of learning.
730	Well, would you look at that.
731	A humbling achievement for one such as I.
732	Didn't know I had it in me.
733	No one can stop me now!
734	I've finally trained enough.
735	Bet I can protect Lady Rhea now.
736	It seems I've grown all I can.
737	My full power is realized.
738	This body has its limits...

805	Hm, yeah, I've got this down.
806	Ah, it's clear to me now.
807	Enlightening!
808	Not a total waste.
809	I'm getting it.
810	I think I...got it...
811	Oh, I see now.
812	I work to grow.
813	It seems I've improved.
814	Well, that worked out.
815	So this is how it's done.
816	I'm really getting the hang of this.
817	This isn't so hard.
818	Am I making progress?
819	I'm getting the hang of this!
820	I'm beginning to understand.
821	I think I get it now.
822	It's fun when you know what you're doing!
823	Hmm, I see.
824	I think I get it.
825	How's this gonna help?
826	I will master this.
827	There is always more to learn.
828	Well worth the effort.
829	Perhaps I'll expand the scope of my research.
830	It's all instinct now.
831	Very well, then.
832	Seems my practice has paid off.
833	Looks like I'm getting it.
834	Technique never betrays.
835	This isn't so hard!
836	I can use this.

905	I see... It's all making sense now.
906	Perhaps I've been well taught.
907	I will master this.
908	How long will this take?
909	Let's put this to the test.
910	I'd never have learned this back in my room.
911	I've grasped it! How lovely.
912	One step before the next step.
913	It's in my grasp.
914	I can do better now.
915	There's so much left to learn.
916	It's all becoming clearer.
917	I'm getting much better!
918	I'm starting to get it!
919	It all makes sense now.
920	Now I see the heart of it.
921	Better than before.
922	I feel like I get it now.
923	Aha, I'm getting it!
924	I think it's coming along.
925	Oh yeah! Gettin' the hang of it!
926	Not as hard as I thought.
927	It seems my proficiency has improved.
928	I understand more every day.
929	I still have much to learn.
930	I always was a quick study.
931	Always something new to learn.
932	I'll make good use of this power.
933	This'll help keep me alive.
934	I'm getting it.
935	Yeah, I'm doin' it!
936	Interesting.

1003	I'm getting closer...
1004	That worked out well.
1005	Experience is everything.
1006	The battlefield has much to teach.
1007	Seems simple enough.
1008	It's starting to take shape.
1009	As long as it makes me stronger.
1010	Hope this is good for something.
1011	I'm a quick study.
1012	I am closing in on expertise.
1013	I've deepened my understanding.
1014	I've got it.

1020	My efforts have borne fruit.

1023	I've got a grasp on this.
1024	It's starting to make sense.
1025	Huh, I'm actually pretty good at this.
1026	I'm gettin' the hang of it.
1027	Hopefully this proves useful.
1028	Aha!
1029	Age is but a number.
1030	I suppose it's working.
1031	Some new insight.
1032	I've really gotten the hang of this.
1033	I've learned a thing or two from battle.
1034	I'm finding my focus.
1035	I can really do this!
1036	Not bad.

1115	My lessons are complete.
1116	I'm pretty much perfect.
1117	That should do it!
1118	I got it all down.

1120	Mastery at last.
1121	I'm good at training.
