Flower001_Info	That’s a Florio Island crystabloom. Our\ninstitute’s logo was designed after this\nflower! We’ve only recently learned\nwhat makes them glow—there’s still\nso much to learn about them.
Flower002_Info	That’s a Belusylva Island crystabloom.\nThis variety gives off a sweet aroma\nthat’s similar to fluffruit, so Pokémon\nare really enticed by it!
Flower003_Info	This crystabloom is native to the\nMaricopia Islands. It’s remarkable how\nthey grow and blossom under the sea.\nPerhaps they’re biologically closer to\ncoral or seaweed than to flowers...
Flower004_Info	That’s a Voluca Island crystabloom.\nEven in such a hot, dry environment,\nthey bloom bright and vibrant as ever.\nThey also seem to have properties\nsimilar to those found in minerals.
Flower005_Info	That’s a Durice Island crystabloom.\nThey can grow and bloom even without\nsunlight because the Illumina energy\nthat flows throughout Lental provides\nthem with nourishment!
Flower006_Info	That’s an Aurus Island crystabloom.\nThey contain traces of each type of\nenergy we’ve detected around Lental.\nWe believe they may be the progenitor\nof all other species of crystabloom.
Remains001_Info	This is part of the ruins we’ve found\nthroughout Florio. We haven’t been\nable to reconstruct their original\nshape yet, so we’re not sure what\npurpose they once served.
Remains002_Info	This is part of the ruins we found on\nthe seabed. We suspect they used to\nbe on dry land and possibly served as\na sort of altar where rituals were held\nto quell...something.
Remains003_Info	We found these ruins at the base of\nan enormous tree in the jungle.\nI wonder if the energy from these\nruins had something to do with how\nthe tree managed to grow so huge.
Remains004_Info	These ruins were deep in the forest.\nJudging by how widely they were\ndistributed, it seems likely they used\nto be part of a group of relatively\nsmall structures.
Remains005_Info	We found these ruins submerged in\nthe lake. It looks like the lake formed\nin a deep recess created by some kind\nof tremendous impact.
Remains006_Info	This is part of the ruins we found\ninside the volcano. Those arches we\nsaw may have served as an entrance\nto a deeper inner sanctum.
Remains007_Info	This is a part of ruins we found in the\ncrater. They were mostly buried, but\nthey seemed similar to the arches we\nsaw earlier in the volcano. How did the\npeople who built them get here?
Remains008_Info	These ruins were in the ice cave in the\nsnowfields. They seem to have been\nbuilt with the cave’s natural structure\nin mind. It’s a shame they’ve been\nsealed shut by all that ice.
Remains009_Info	We found these ruins deep beneath the\nearth. I suspect the glowing stones in\nthe ceiling were also part of the ruins.\nPerhaps their light helped nourish the\nsurrounding plant life.
Remains010_Info	We found this roughly 2,000-year-old\nmural deep inside the cave.\nUnfortunately, because that center-\nright piece of the image is missing,\nwe can’t tell what the mural depicts.
Remains011_Info	That’s the entrance to the Ruins of\nRemembrance. The ruins themselves\npractically span the entire island, and\nthey’re in beautiful condition. I hope to\nuncover all their secrets someday.
Remains012_Info	This mural depicts a scene from the\nlegends. It shows the six Illumina\nPokémon coming together to stop the\nmeteorite. It seems to be the same\nas the mural in Outaway Cave.

EV_Fr_FlowerNew2_01	This is a Belusylva Island crystabloom!
EV_Fr_FlowerNew3_01	This is a Maricopia Islands crystabloom!
EV_Fr_FlowerNew4_01	This is a Voluca Island crystabloom!
EV_Fr_FlowerNew5_01	This is a Durice Island crystabloom!
EV_Fr_FlowerNew6_01	This is an Aurus Island crystabloom!
EV_Cat_FlowerNew_Light_01	That glow is what we call the Illumina phenomenon.
EV_Cat_FlowerNew_Light_02	This is the first time you’ve photographed one in the Illumina state!
EV_End_ScenarioFlower1_Light_01	I learned how the Illumina phenomenon works by studying\nthese flowers.
EV_End_ScenarioFlower2_Light_01	This is the first time I’ve seen the Illumina phenomenon caught on\ncamera outside of what we’ve seen on Florio.
EV_End_ScenarioFlower3_Light_01	Now we know the crystablooms here can undergo the Illumina\nphenomenon even underwater.
EV_End_ScenarioFlower4_Light_01	This island’s crystablooms must be especially hardy to survive in\nsuch harsh environments.
EV_End_ScenarioFlower5_Light_01	These bloom even in the snow and ice! Maybe that’s thanks to the\npotent Illumina energy that flows through this island.
EV_End_ScenarioFlower6_Light_01	These seem to contain elements of the energies we’ve seen on the\nother islands. Perhaps all crystablooms descended from these...
EV_Fr_FlowerCom1_01	It’s a Florio Island crystabloom.
EV_Fr_FlowerCom2_01	It’s a Belusylva Island crystabloom.
EV_Fr_FlowerCom3_01	It’s a Maricopia Islands crystabloom.
EV_Fr_FlowerCom4_01	It’s a Voluca Island crystabloom.
EV_Fr_FlowerCom5_01	It’s a Durice Island crystabloom.
EV_Fr_FlowerCom6_01	It’s an Aurus Island crystabloom.
EV_Cat_FlowerCom_Light_01	It’s glowing! That’s the Illumina phenomenon in action.
EV_Cat_FlowerCom_Dark_01	These odd flowers are closely linked to the Illumina phenomenon.
EV_End_FlowerCom_Light_01	Very good. This may bring us a step closer to understanding the\nIllumina phenomenon.
EV_End_FlowerCom_Dark_01	I’m still not sure what conditions are required for it to glow on its own\nin nature.
EV_Fr_Remains1_01	These are some ancient ruins on Florio Island.
EV_Fr_Remains2_01	These are some ancient ruins on Belusylva Island.
EV_Fr_Remains3_01	These are some ancient ruins on the Maricopia Islands.
EV_Fr_Remains4_01	These are some ancient ruins on Voluca Island.
EV_Fr_Remains5_01	These are some ancient ruins on Durice Island.
EV_Fr_Remains6_01	These are some ancient ruins on Aurus Island.
EV_Cat_RemainsNew_01	Excellent find! Aren’t these incredible?
EV_Cat_RemainsCom_01	This looks like a clue to the history of the Lental region.
EV_End_RemainsNew_01	I get the feeling we’re drawing closer to the center of an\nancient mystery.
EV_End_RemainsCom_01	All of the ruins we’ve found date back to roughly the same time\nperiod, as far as I can tell.
EV_Fr_BossNew1_01	Wow! Meganium, the Illumina Pokémon of Florio Island!
EV_Fr_BossNew2_01	Wow! Milotic, the Illumina Pokémon of Belusylva Island!
EV_Fr_BossNew3_01	Wow! Wishiwashi, the Illumina Pokémon of the Maricopia Islands!
EV_Fr_BossNew4_01	Wow! Volcarona, the Illumina Pokémon of Voluca Island!
EV_Fr_BossNew5_01	Wow! Steelix, the Illumina Pokémon of Durice Island!
EV_Fr_BossNew6_01	Wow! Xerneas, the Illumina Pokémon of Aurus Island!
EV_Cat_BossNew_Light_01	I’m amazed you caught this on camera.
EV_End_ScenarioBoss1_Light_01	It must have been tricky capturing the moment when its beautiful,\nglowing pattern appeared.
EV_End_ScenarioBoss2_Light_01	Excellent job getting a shot of it swimming around so gracefully!
EV_End_ScenarioBoss3_Light_01	I imagine it was an intense experience having Wishiwashi’s School\nForm up close like that.
EV_End_ScenarioBoss4_Light_01	Lining up your shot as they flitted around together must have been\npretty tough.
EV_End_ScenarioBoss5_Light_01	Finding Steelix as it burrowed through those tunnels was no easy\ntask, I bet.
EV_End_ScenarioBoss6_Light_01	The final Illumina Pokémon... If not for this photo, I’d probably think\nthat encounter was all a dream!
EA_ScenarioBoss1_NoSnap_01	Try to photograph Meganium when that glowing\npattern appears!
EA_ScenarioBoss2_NoSnap_01	Try to photograph Milotic when that glowing\npattern appears!
EA_ScenarioBoss2_NoSnap_02	If you can bop Milotic with something while it’s\nunderwater, maybe it’ll come up to the surface.
EA_ScenarioBoss3_NoSnap_01	Try to photograph Wishiwashi in School Form when\nthat glowing pattern appears.
EA_ScenarioBoss3_NoSnap_02	If you can make those Wishiwashi glow, I think\nsomething new might happen.
EA_ScenarioBoss4_NoSnap_01	Try to photograph either Volcarona when its glowing\npattern appears!
EA_ScenarioBoss4_NoSnap_02	Do you think a few fluffruit might put out those\nprotective flames?
EA_ScenarioBoss5_NoSnap_01	Try to photograph Steelix when that glowing\npattern appears!
EA_ScenarioBoss5_NoSnap_02	Maybe Steelix will react if you throw something into\nthose holes all around.
EA_ScenarioBoss6_NoSnap_01	Try to photograph Xerneas when that glowing\npattern appears!
EA_ScenarioBoss6_NoSnap_02	Maybe an Illumina orb would energize that sphere of\nlight that’s flying around.
EA_ScenarioIllumina2_NoSnap_01	I need you to photograph a crystabloom glowing in the\njungle at night.
EA_ScenarioIllumina2_NoSnap_02	What we learn from the photo will help me make\nsomething important.
EA_ScenarioIllumina3_NoSnap_01	I need you to photograph a glowing crystabloom\nin the ocean.
EA_ScenarioIllumina3_NoSnap_02	What we learn from the photo will help me make an\nIllumina orb for the Maricopia Islands.
EA_ScenarioIllumina4_NoSnap_01	I need you to photograph a glowing crystabloom\nin the desert at night.
EA_ScenarioIllumina4_NoSnap_02	What we learn from the photo will help me make an\nIllumina orb for Voluca Island.
EA_ScenarioIllumina5_NoSnap_01	I need you to photograph a glowing crystabloom\nin the snowfields at night.
EA_ScenarioIllumina5_NoSnap_02	What we learn from the photo will help me make an\nIllumina orb for Durice Island.
EA_ScenarioIllumina6_NoSnap_01	I need you to photograph a glowing crystabloom\nin the ruins.
EA_ScenarioIllumina6_NoSnap_02	What we learn from the photo will help me make an\nIllumina orb for Aurus Island.
EB_Scenario1st_01	Welcome back! I hope you had a good time in\nFlorio Nature Park.
EB_Scenario1st_02	Now, just like before, it’s time to show me some photos\nyou took.
EB_Scenario1st_03	Go ahead and choose one photo per Pokémon.
EB_Scenario1st_NoSnap_01	Oh, wait.\nI see you didn’t take any photos out there.
EB_Scenario1st_NoSnap_02	Well, you can teleport back to the park entrance for\nanother try. Get some Pokémon photos!
EA_Scenario1st_01	So, what did you think?
EA_Scenario1st_02	Did you get to add some new pages to your Photodex?
EA_Scenario1st_03	One last thing: Let me tell you about research levels.
EA_Scenario1st_04	Your research level on a course tells you how much\nprogress you’ve made there.
EA_Scenario1st_05	Once that level goes up, you may see Pokémon behave\nin ways you haven’t seen before.
EA_Scenario1st_06	The key to raising your research level is to observe all\ntypes of Pokémon’s behaviors.
EA_Scenario1st_07	That means getting photographs of them in every\ncategory—from 1★ to 4★.
EA_Scenario1st_08	So in short, fill up that Photodex! Keep that in mind, and\nyou’ll be on the right track.
EA_Scenario1st_09	So get out there and snap lots of photos—and cherish\nthe encounters with Pokémon you have along the way!
EB_ScenarioCom_01	We’ve got a lot to discuss... But first, let’s get your\nphotos evaluated.
EA_GetFlower_01	By the way...
EA_GetFlower_02	Now that we’ve got that crystabloom info, I’ve got\nsomething to report.
EA_GetFlower_03	I hope you’re excited!
EA_GetBoss_01	By the way...
EA_GetBoss_02	Now that we’ve got that Illumina Pokémon info, I’ve got\nsomething to report.
EA_GetBoss_03	I’ll fill you in once your photos are squared away. I think\nyou’ll be pleased to hear this!
EA_GetCourse_01	By the way...
EA_GetCourse_02	Thanks to the progress you’ve made in your research,\nI’ve got something to report.
EA_GetCourse_03	I’ll fill you in once your photos are squared away. I think\nyou’ll be pleased to hear this!

Poke_Info.msbt
P001_Info_00	Pikachu build up electricity in their cheek\nsacs while they sleep. They’re also very\ncurious—you’ll often see one playing at\nour research camp.
P002_Info_00	It’s said that Eevee have unique genes that\nharbor a wide range of Evolutionary\npotential. Perhaps the Eevee native to the\nLental region have also been influenced by\nthe different environments on each island.
P003_Info_00	Heracross are incredibly powerful—strong\nenough to toss even large foes as if they\nweigh nothing at all! But they’re usually\nrather gentle, often sharing sap with\nother Pokémon.
P004_Info_00	You may have spotted Pinsir’s prominent\nhorns sticking out of the ground in the\nnature park at night. It burrows beneath\nthe ground to protect itself from the cold.
P005_Info_00	Torchic often peck at the ground in search\nof pebbles. Eating pebbles helps it digest\nits food and makes the flames it exhales\neven hotter. You could say it’s like feeding\ntwo birds with one stone!
P006_Info_00	Pichu may be small, but it can still give foes\nquite a shock! It’s not very good at storing\nelectricity, though, so it sticks close to\nbigger Pokémon for safety.
P007_Info_00	Dodrio can speed through the entire nature\npark before you know it. It can jump so high\nwith its powerful legs, it may as well\nbe flying!
P008_Info_00	This eager eater consumes leaf after leaf\nwhile hiding in tall grass. When Caterpie\nsenses danger, it exudes a horrible odor\nfrom the antenna on its head to\nprotect itself.
P009_Info_00	Lapras is so intelligent that it can\nunderstand human speech—and it’s got a\nbeautiful singing voice, too! On days when\nthe sea is calm, you can often see young\nLapras swimming with their parents.
P010_Info_00	Swanna migrate to the lake in the nature\npark for the winter. When spring arrives,\nthey all take flight at once. It’s like a scene\nstraight out of a painting!
P011_Info_00	Aipom dart about the treetops, swinging\nfrom branch to branch with their dexterous\ntails—which are also strong enough to\ncut through the underbrush!
P012_Info_00	These little ones are part of the reason\nthis jungle smells so sweet! But that aroma\ncan attract Pikipek, which sometimes carry\nBounsweet off to their storage holes.
P013_Info_00	Inside that hard shell, Metapod’s cells are\nbeing completely rebuilt! Metapod often\nstick together in groups, moving as little as\npossible so their innards don’t spill out of\ntheir shells.
P014_Info_00	You’ve probably seen Beautifly fluttering\nabout in search of its favorite food—pollen.\nIn addition to nectar, its long, thin proboscis\nis also perfect for sucking up water and\nfruit juices.
P015_Info_00	Wherever there’s a body of water, odds are\nyou’ll also find Magikarp. All it does is flop\naround, so it seems kinda weak, but it may\nin fact be hardier than it looks!
P016_Info_00	Thanks to the suction pads on its feet,\nWurmple can scoot right up any surface!\nWhen threatened, it defends itself by\nreleasing poison from its tail spikes.
P017_Info_00	These Ducklett were born and raised on\nthe lake in the nature park. They’re not\ngreat fliers yet, but they’ll eventually learn\nby watching and imitating Swanna.
P018_Info_00	Wooper is very timid and tends to stick\nclose to Quagsire. Its body is also coated in\na poisonous goo. Whatever you do, don’t\ntouch it, or else your hand will really sting!
P019_Info_00	Did you notice the scorched fruit on the\nground in the nature park? That was an\nEmolga’s doing. It zapped the fruit with\nelectricity from its cheek sacs!
P020_Info_00	Noibat’s ears emit ultrasonic waves that\nhelp it perceive its surroundings and fly\nsafely in total darkness. You might also see\nit using those same waves on fruit to check\nif it’s ripe.
P021_Info_00	Tyrantrum reigns like a king over the other\nland-dwelling prehistoric Pokémon around\nthe volcano. It’s completely unguarded\nwhen it sleeps—probably because it’s so\nstrong that it feels no need to be cautious.
P022_Info_00	Have you ever seen a Hippowdon blast\nsand out of the ports on its body? It does\nthat to make room for the fresh sand it’ll\nswallow to keep itself healthy.
P023_Info_00	Wingull rides updrafts over the sea to glide\nsmoothly through the air. It uses that\nmomentum to dive down into the ocean to\ncatch food.
P024_Info_00	This mystical Pokémon is the subject of\nnumerous legends. It’s highly intelligent\nand extremely curious, so it closely studies\nothers to try to learn all it can about them.
P025_Info_00	Cubchoo live happily on the snowfields\nunder the watchful eye of Beartic. They\nsay you can tell how healthy a Cubchoo is\nby looking at the snot dangling from\nits nose.
P026_Info_00	Chandelure may look like it’s protecting the\nruins, but it’s more likely that it just lives\nthere. It seems to absorb energy by waving\nits eerie flames.
P027_Info_00	Skorupi often hides in the sand, waiting \nfor its chance to catch a meal. It’s a very\npatient Pokémon that can survive for long\nstretches of time without food.
P028_Info_00	If you spot a hole in a tree in the jungle, it’s\nprobably a Pikipek’s food storage. It uses\nits hard beak to repeatedly peck at the tree\nuntil it bores a hole.
P029_Info_00	Beartic has a rather violent temper and\noften fights with Mamoswine over territory.\nBut it shows its more nurturing side when\nit rescues Cubchoo that need its help.
P030_Info_00	Toucannon use their huge beaks to\ncommunicate. If you see two of them\nsmacking their beaks together, don’t worry.\nThey’re not fighting—they’re just telling\neach other how they feel.
P031_Info_00	Quagsire doesn’t like the sun, so it usually\nstays underwater during the day. It has a\nreally easygoing nature, but it’s also quite\nloyal and protective of timid Wooper.
P032_Info_00	When Bidoof find a nice spot by the water,\nthey build a dam and make themselves at\nhome there. Though the dam cuts off the\nflow of water for a while, it actually does\ngreat things for the environment!
P034_Info_00	The patterns on a Vivillon’s wings adapt to\nthe environment. Even on the same island,\nyou can find different Vivillon in areas with\ndifferent climates.
P035_Info_00	Aerodactyl rules the air in and around the\nvolcano where many prehistoric Pokémon\nlive. It seems to like amber—maybe it\nbrings back memories of old friends.
P036_Info_00	It sure was a surprise when Flygon\nsuddenly appeared out of that huge\nsandstorm! The flapping of this Pokémon’s\nwings sounds like singing, and those who\nhave heard it call Flygon the Desert Spirit.
P037_Info_00	Wailord is one of the biggest Pokémon in\nthe Lental region and can be found going\nfor a leisurely swim in the sea. It’s so huge\nthat it has no natural enemies, so it’s very\nat ease and loves to play.
P038_Info_00	Wailmer can survive on land for a time, but\nit loses vitality if its body dries out, so it\ntends to stay in the sea. Apparently it likes\nto startle other Pokémon, as you can see\nfrom all the pranks it plays!
P039_Info_00	Slugma stays near the lava because if its\nmagma body ever cools, it will harden and\nmake this Pokémon unable to move. It often\nburns its food with its own heat, so\neating can be a tricky task for it.
P040_Info_00	This kindly species will swim alongside\nsmaller Pokémon to keep them from\nfeeling lonely. A lot of different Pokémon\nseem naturally drawn to Alomomola.
P041_Info_00	When Mantine swim as a school, they often\nrace one another. Sometimes Mantine will\nbuild up so much speed, it leaps right out\nof the water!
P042_Info_00	The cold of the snowfields has hardened\nMamoswine’s icy tusks, making them\nstrong enough to withstand even Beartic’s\nclaws. Swinub must feel much safer when\nthey’re with Mamoswine.
P044_Info_00	This Pokémon’s appearance changes with\nthe passing of the seasons. Normally, you\ncould never see all four forms of Sawsbuck\nat the same time, but Elsewhere Forest\nseems to be the exception!
P045_Info_00	It looks like we’ve got some Carbink living\nhappily together with Diancie. Carbink are\nsaid to be born from the high temperatures\nand pressures found in cave systems.
P046_Info_00	Sableye was scratching at the ground with\nits sharp claws, looking for its favorite\nfood—gemstones. Did you notice the glint\nin its eyes when it saw Carbink?
P047_Info_00	Luvdisc’s heart-shaped body really stands\nout, making it an easy target for predators.\nIt rests between the branches of Corsola\nfor protection.
P048_Info_00	When Pidgeot flaps its wings, it can whip up\na gust of wind capable of blowing away just\nabout anything. It also has excellent vision\nand can zero in on leaping Magikarp from a\nfar-off distance.
P049_Info_00	Onix can burrow as effortlessly through\nrock walls as it can through a sea of sand.\nOther Pokémon make their dens in the\ntunnels it leaves in its wake.
P050_Info_00	Each of Exeggutor’s three heads thinks\nindependently, but they get along well with\neach other. It sleeps among trees on the\ncoast as camouflage for protection.
P052_Info_00	Bellossom usually hide in vegetation, but\nwhen something puts them in a happy\nmood, they come out of hiding to dance\nwith their friends.
P053_Info_00	Slaking is the laziest Pokémon in the world.\nIt usually only eats whatever is in reach.\nIf you see it walking around at night, it’s\nprobably overwhelmingly hungry!
P054_Info_00	Sharpedo is known as the Bully of the Sea.\nIt’ll challenge anyone and anything to a\nswimming race. It definitely swims fast,\nbut it can’t maintain that speed for long.
P055_Info_00	Cacnea goes with the flow of its desert\nenvironment without a care in the world.\nIts thorns are so sharp that random objects\nsometimes get stuck to them.
P056_Info_00	If you see the pink patterns on Finneon’s\ntail fins shining at night, that means it\nstored up plenty of sunlight during the day.\nIsn’t Finneon beautiful when it flutters its\nfins like a pair of delicate wings?
P057_Info_00	Yanmega’s wings are powerful enough to\ncreate shock waves when it accelerates.\nWhen it wants to rest, it turns its body\nupside down and stops for a while on\na branch.
P058_Info_00	Liepard dashes through the jungle with\nsinewy grace without making a sound. But\nit’s a fickle Pokémon and usually spends\nmore of its time just loafing around.
P059_Info_00	Do you know why you see Stunfisk buried\nin the sand at the beach? They’re waiting\nto shock the first unlucky passerby to step\non them!
P060_Info_00	Those Mandibuzz in the desert aren’t just\ngoing for a leisurely flight—they’re also\nlooking for food. Other Pokémon are\nalways on alert so that Mandibuzz won’t\nsteal their meals!
P061_Info_00	Florges can live for hundreds of years, and\nit devotes its entire life to protecting a\nsingle garden. It’s thanks to Florges that\nthe flower gardens in the nature park are\nso beautiful.
P062_Info_00	When night falls, you can hear Primarina’s\ngorgeous singing voice being carried on the\nocean breeze. Primarina looks almost\nmagical as it sings against the backdrop of\na full moon.
P063_Info_00	When Crabrawler fights, it attacks and\ndefends just like a boxer. Sometimes it\nmistakes Exeggutor for a normal tree on\nthe beach and punches it by accident.
P064_Info_00	This loyal Pokémon always does what it\ncan for those it holds dear. It uses its rocky\nmane and claws to protect Rockruff in\nits care.
P064_Info_01	This proud, solitary Pokémon almost never\neats anything that it didn’t catch itself. It’s\nalways hungry for a battle, though—even\nagainst terribly strong opponents.
P065_Info_00	Comfey’s vine is packed with nutrients, so\nany flowers it attaches to its vine are\nrevitalized and bloom brightly. The Comfey\nin the nature park love Florges’s flowers\nand spend all their time in its garden.
P066_Info_00	Pyukumuku may look cute, but they pack a\npowerful wallop! They can spit out their\ninternal organs and use them to fight—or\nto compete against each other to see which\nis the strongest.
P067_Info_00	Jolteon can charge every hair on its body\nwith electricity. The charge is so powerful\nthat even if Jolteon sheds its fur, the hairs\ncan stay electrically charged a long time!
P068_Info_00	Blastoise’s water cannons pack so much\npower, they can propel Blastoise through\nthe air! The Pokémon can also be seen\nsunbathing at times. It appears to feel\nsafer when it’s tucked inside its shell.
P069_Info_00	This Pokémon is a talented surfer, using\nits psychic power to ride the waves. It’s\nalways practicing on the beach, waiting for\nthat perfect wave to roll in.
P070_Info_00	An empty-looking blue hole may actually\nbe home to Vaporeon. Because their cells\nare similar to water molecules, Vaporeon\ncan’t be seen when they’re in the water.
P071_Info_00	Machamp’s four muscular arms make it\nan excellent swimmer. It can move through\nthe water as fast as any aquatic Pokémon.
P072_Info_00	Flareon is extremely curious and shows\ninterest in a wide variety of things. Its body\ntemperature rises when it gets excited, but\nit stays cool by releasing heat from its\nfluffy fur.
P074_Info_00	Illumina Pokémon hadn’t been seen on\nFlorio Island for almost a century until you\nencountered this one and took its photo!\nMeganium seems so happy living with the\nother Pokémon on that flowery hill.
P075_Info_00	When Umbreon gets excited, the patterns\non its body glow and give off energy. The\none we saw in the ruins seems to hang out\nwith Absol a lot.
P076_Info_00	Hoothoot are said to be more accurate\ntimekeepers than any clock. As nocturnal\nPokémon, they’re not big fans of light, so\nthey spend the daylight hours sleeping in\nholes in tree trunks.
P077_Info_00	Espeon can predict just about anything\nby simply detecting slight shifts in the air.\nIt seemed to be leading you through\nElsewhere Forest so you wouldn’t get lost.
P078_Info_00	Murkrow fly throughout the nature park\nafter sunset, looking for the glint of shiny\nobjects in the darkness. They’re fearless\ncreatures that won’t hesitate to tease\nPokémon much larger than them.
P079_Info_00	Corsola grow so beautifully by absorbing\nnutrients from clean ocean waters through\nthe branches on their heads. Sometimes\ntheir branches glow in rainbow colors if\nthe sunlight hits them just right.
P080_Info_00	Octillery wanders around until it finds the\nperfect rocky crag to hide under. If it angers\nanother Pokémon by wandering into its\nterritory, Octillery will spit ink to cover\nits escape.
P081_Info_00	When it gets cold, Taillow flock to the\nnature park in search of food. They may\npeck at Wurmple, but they usually get\ndriven away.
P082_Info_00	Pelipper is sometimes referred to as a\ncourier of the skies due to its habit of\ncarrying things inside its beak. When it’s\nhungry, it sometimes dives down into\nthe water to search for food.
P083_Info_00	Zangoose certainly has a brave side, using\nits sharp claws to fight back against foes.\nBut it actually seems to enjoy peaceful\nactivities, like listening to the sound of the\nocean waves or nearby singing.
P085_Info_00	Seviper must be a real stickler to spend\nso much time sharpening its tail blade.\nSpeaking of which, that blade is extremely\ndangerous! Not just because it’s sharp—it\nalso oozes a deadly poison.
P086_Info_00	From the moment they’re born, the trio that\nmake up Combee work together for the\nsake of Vespiquen. The nectar they gather\nfrom flowers that grow near crystablooms\nis particularly rich and sweet.
P087_Info_00	Torterra live in groups deep in the forest.\nSmall Pokémon seem to feel safe on their\nbroad backs, which are densely covered\nwith trees and other plant life.
P088_Info_00	Clamperl is constantly in search of safe\ncoral reefs where it can protect itself. It’ll\nsometimes catch a ride from Drifblim when\nit wants to move.
P089_Info_00	Vespiquen gives orders to Combee by\nreleasing various pheromones. It looks\nalmost like an orchestra conductor as it\ncommands them.
P090_Info_00	I knew Glaceon could freeze the air around\nit by controlling its body temperature, but I\nwas surprised to see one whip up a flurry\nof diamond dust with just a single cry.
P091_Info_00	Tangrowth uses its vine arms to nimbly\npluck fruit that’s just out of reach. It can\nalso extend its arms even farther to carry\nitself across long distances.
P092_Info_00	Did you notice how clear the air was near\nthe waterfall in the jungle? That’s because\nLeafeon, with its plantlike cells, has been\ncleaning the air with photosynthesis.
P093_Info_00	Drifblim float around as they please during\nthe day, but at night they drift off to who\nknows where. Apparently, some of the\nClamperl they’ve carried away are\nstill missing.
P094_Info_00	Manaphy has a wondrous power that lets\nit bond with any kind of Pokémon. It will\nsometimes rise up from the ocean floor,\nlured by the sound of beautiful singing.
P095_Info_00	Shaymin has the incredible power to\ntransform ruined land into a lush field.\nWhen it curls up, it looks like a flowering\nplant, so it’s hard to spot even up close.
P097_Info_00	A charging Bouffalant can pulverize a huge\nboulder with a single headbutt! Even if a\nfierce fight breaks out within the herd, the\nfluffy fur on their heads absorbs impacts,\npreventing injuries.
P098_Info_00	Inkay instinctively reacts to anything in the\nwater that lights up or makes an echoing\nsound. That’s because it usually uses its\nown luminescence to communicate with\nothers of its kind.
P099_Info_00	Sylveon has really made itself at home in\nthe flower meadow in the nature park. It\nseems to love living there—dancing nimbly\nas it emits waves of soothing energy.
P100_Info_00	Mareanie live together in groups, and each\none has 10 tentacles and a poison spike on\nits head. You may spot Mareanie chasing \nCorsola now and then—they love the taste\nof Corsola branches.
P101_Info_00	They say that a mound of sand became\npossessed by the grudges of the departed,\ngiving birth to Sandygast. Think twice about\ngoing near any cute-looking shovels you\nsee sticking out of the sand.
P102_Info_00	Squirtle doesn’t bask in the sun just to dry\noff its shell—it’s also absorbing nutrients\nto help it grow strong. It’s still weak for\nnow, though, so it often needs friends like\nLapras to rescue it.
P103_Info_00	Morelull stays hidden and sleeps during\nthe day, but at night it becomes more\nactive. Its spores can make you feel\nvery drowsy.
P104_Info_00	Charmander live together in groups so they\ncan all watch each other’s tail and make\nsure the flames never go out. If you can\nonly see one Charmander, look around—its\nfriends are sure to be nearby.
P105_Info_00	Ariados spins silk from both its rear and its\nmouth. It uses the silk to build its web and\ncatch prey. If it’s not on its web, you can bet\nit’s wandering around somewhere,\nsearching for food.
P106_Info_00	When Bulbasaur is born, it lives for a while\nvia photosynthesis and the nutrients in the\nseed on its back. Until it grows bigger, it\ndepends on other Pokémon to survive.
P107_Info_00	This Illumina Pokémon lives deep beneath\nthe ground on Lental’s most remote island.\nWe can tell from the nearby ruins that this\nSteelix used to interact with the people\nof the time.
P108_Info_00	This Illumina Pokémon looked stunning as\nit swam gracefully through the clear water.\nI suspect some connection with Meganium\nstirred Milotic from its sleep.
P109_Info_00	It never occurred to me that there would be\ntwo Illumina Pokémon on Voluca Island.\nIt looked like the Volcarona were talking to\neach other as they flew. I wonder what they\nwere saying.
P110_Info_00	I believe the Xerneas we saw in the ruins\nwas the very first Illumina Pokémon. It’s\nbeen about 2,000 years since it went to\nsleep after protecting Lental. Do you think\nit will ever fully reawaken?
P111_Info_00	We found this Illumina Pokémon deep in\nthe sea, where even Captain Vince never\ntraveled. Wishiwashi usually only school\ntogether when they’re threatened—maybe\nthey’re different in the Maricopia Islands.
P111_Info_01	These Illumina Wishiwashi have grouped\ntogether into their School Form. As soon\nas they gathered, we picked up an Illumina\nenergy reading that was absolutely\nenormous.
P112_Info_00	Grookey loves music and high places, and\nyou’ll often see it beating out a rhythm or\ndancing. When it uses its stick to strike up\na beat, even the plants and flowers in the\narea seem happier and revitalized.
P113_Info_00	Scorbunny runs around to pump itself up\nand get its fire energy flowing. It’s so\ncarefree about running that it sometimes\nzooms right into trouble!
P114_Info_00	Sobble is so timid that it bursts into tears\nat the slightest shock. A chemical in its\ntears causes other Pokémon nearby to\nstart crying as well.
P115_Info_00	The aroma of the flower on Venusaur’s\nback soothes the Pokémon around it.\nSmaller Pokémon by the waterside\ncertainly looked relaxed and comfortable\nas they played with it.
P116_Info_00	It must take some serious skill to sleep\nso securely on tree branches in the\njungle! Arbok also displays the face-like\npattern on its hood when it wants to\nintimidate foes.
P117_Info_00	The skin on Sandshrew’s back is very hard,\nand Sandshrew protects itself by curling\ninto a ball. This also helps it move around\nfaster—it can just roll across the desert!
P121_Info_00	Kangaskhan raises its young in the pouch\non its belly. It’ll threaten anyone who gets\ntoo close but only out of a desire to protect\nits young. It’s actually a very kind Pokémon.
P123_Info_00	Mew is an incredibly intelligent Pokémon\nthat lives hidden in the ruins. People say it\nonly appears before those who are pure\nof heart.
P124_Info_00	When night falls, Ledian flutters about,\nscattering a sparkling dust. It seems very\ndrawn to anything that lights up—maybe\nbecause it uses starlight as energy.
P127_Info_00	Tyranitar has such a sturdy body, it can\neven doze off in the middle of a sandstorm.\nWe saw it waiting in the desert, hoping for a\nsuitably strong opponent to come along.
P129_Info_00	Those bowl-shaped holes you see in the\ndesert are Trapinch nests. They’re very\neffective—both at protecting Trapinch and\nat funneling any food to it that falls in.
P131_Info_00	Swampert has powerful vision that allows\nit to see through muddy river water. The\nreason it covers itself with mud when it’s\non land is because it wants to keep its\nskin moist.
P132_Info_00	Shinx looked like it was having fun playing\nwith Charmander. As the Pokémon ran\naround chasing each other, Shinx’s forelegs\nwere naturally generating electricity.
P138_Info_00	Heliolisk uses electricity to stimulate its\nleg muscles, allowing it to move so fast it\ncan run on water! It can generate more\nelectricity at once if it spreads its frill.
P141_Info_00	Minior is usually covered in a hard shell,\nbut this is its true form. They normally\naren’t so active when they’re exposed like\nthis. I wonder if that could be related to\nthe Illumina phenomenon somehow.
P141_Info_01	It’s said that this Pokémon arrived here\nfrom the night sky. It sure looked beautiful\nflying back up to the sky over the desert.
P143_Info_00	I bet you’ve seen Rattata near the lab a lot,\nplaying with Trubbish. I know they need to\ngnaw on things to keep their fangs from\ngrowing too long, but I really wish they\nwouldn’t chew up the lab’s support beams!
P144_Info_00	Thanks to its huge claws, this Pokémon\ncan move through snow as though it were\nswimming. The ice spikes on its back are\neven sharper than its claws, and they\nprotect it from just about anything.
P145_Info_00	When it feels wary, Alolan Vulpix exhales\nfreezing-cold air from its mouth to\nintimidate foes. It was nice to see it playing\ninnocently with its Pokémon friends.
P146_Info_00	At some point, Meowth made itself at home\nnear camp and started dropping by to nap\nor play around. I wouldn’t mind so much if\nit’d just keep its paws off the NEO-ONE...
P147_Info_00	Dewgong can swim incredibly fast thanks\nto its streamlined body, which has little\ndrag in the water. On the snowfields, we\nsaw one playing with a Spheal like it was\nplaying with a ball.
P148_Info_00	I’ve heard that Jynx can make all sorts of\nthings happen just by wishing for them. We\ndid see some odd occurrences in the Shiver\nSnowfields involving Jynx, so there may be\nsome truth to that claim.
P149_Info_00	Furret sure is agile, as we saw by the\nway it nimbly darted between the trees in\nthe snowfields. Its long, slender body is\nperfectly suited for its habit of hiding inside\nnarrow dens and fallen trees.
P150_Info_00	Sudowoodo often comes to the research\ncamp. I think it wants to be friends with the\nother Pokémon here. It tried to get closer\nby pretending to be a tree, but it ran away\nwhen it got startled.
P151_Info_00	Swinub have an excellent sense of smell,\nwhich helps them find things buried in the\nsnow. Whenever they go somewhere\ndangerous, Mamoswine are sure to go\nwith them.
P152_Info_00	Delibird have a habit of storing food in their\nsack-like tails. We even saw one that had\nstuffed its tail so heavy that it couldn’t\neven move!
P153_Info_00	Skarmory flew with such acrobatic skill\nover the snowfields. Its steel body is hard\nand sturdy, but because of its hollow\nbones, it’s actually very lightweight.
P154_Info_00	Suicune is said to be the embodiment of\nnorth winds. True to its reputation, we saw\nit racing like wind across the snowfields.\nWhat an elegant sight to behold!
P155_Info_00	Wild Mightyena live in packs with very strict\nhierarchies. When the pack leader howls,\nthe others howl with it to send information\nto faraway allies.
P156_Info_00	Snorunt prefer caves and other enclosed\nspaces where they feel protected. That\nexplains why we saw one living in a hole\ndug out from a mound of snow in the\nShiver Snowfields.
P157_Info_00	Glalie seemed to be living happily with\nFroslass in a cave on the snowfields. It\ncan lower its own body temperature to\nmake its icy armor even harder.
P158_Info_00	Thanks to its fluffy fur coat, Spheal’s round\nbody stays warm even in ice-cold water.\nIt looks like it loves rolling around and\nplaying with Dewgong!
P159_Info_00	Piplup isn’t a great walker, with all its\nstumbling and falling, but it’s very good\nat swimming. It likes to find shells\nunderwater and show them off to\nits friends.
P160_Info_00	On clear days, you’ll often see Starly flying\naround the research camp. Sometimes\nthey get startled and flee, but even then,\nthey tend to stay close by. It’s surprisingly\nbrave of them.
P161_Info_00	Abomasnow lives where it’s snowy all\nyear round. When it gets angry, it can whip\nup a blizzard and totally drown its\nsurroundings in white.
P162_Info_00	You probably noticed marks scratched into\nthe tree trunks in the snowfields. Those are\nactually messages that Weavile leave for\neach other.
P163_Info_00	Froslass has a habit of freezing things it\nlikes and displaying them as decorations.\nSeeing the pieces of the ruins it had on\ndisplay, I’d say Froslass and I are\nkindred spirits!
P164_Info_00	Stoutland is my Pokémon partner! It’s\nreally smart—if I’m too caught up in my\nresearch to notice guests have arrived,\nit’ll let me know with a loud bark.
P165_Info_00	You’ve come across Audino plenty of times\nin my lab, I’m sure. It’s so sensitive to\nsound, it can pick up on the tiniest changes\naround it. It’s always the first to notice if\nI’m not feeling well.
P166_Info_00	Trubbish love to eat garbage, and when\nthey’ve eaten their fill, they belch up poison\ngas. There was an unfortunate incident\nonce when Trubbish belched inside the lab.\nIt’s not allowed inside anymore.
P167_Info_00	Vanilluxe can’t even move until both of its\nheads agree to a course of action. If you\nsee one staying still, look closely—you may\nnotice that one of its heads is napping.
P168_Info_00	Braviary’s appearance may stick out on the \nsnowfields, but this warrior of the skies\nhas survived nonetheless. Its courage is\nunmatched, and it never backs down from\na challenge.
P169_Info_00	If you see any holes in the ground at the\nresearch camp, you can bet Bunnelby dug\nthem. Its huge shovel-like ears let it dig a\ntremendous amount of soil in one go.
P170_Info_00	Somehow, this Pokémon remained frozen\nin hibernation since prehistoric times.\nIts awakening could be connected to the\nIllumina phenomenon, I think.
P171_Info_00	Dedenne love electricity, so they tend to\nlive near humans. One often comes to my\nlab to feed on the electricity. Speaking of\nwhich, I was pretty shocked when it erased\nsome of my data!
P172_Info_00	By floating on top of the lake, Avalugg can\npass itself off as an ice floe. It doesn’t seem\nto mind if other Pokémon hitch a ride on top\nof it to cross the water.
P173_Info_00	Crabominable tends to punch whatever it\nsees without stopping to think. When it’s\nfired up in the heat of battle, it can unleash\nan unbelievable amount of power.
P174_Info_00	You can often see Cutiefly around the\nflower beds at the research camp. They\njust love the flowers here. I’ve heard that\nthey can tell which flowers are about to\nbloom by reading their auras.
P175_Info_00	Charizard form herds with Charmander,\nand they all live together near the volcano.\nThe flames they breathe are as hot as the\nlava around them.
P176_Info_00	A lot of old writings link Clefairy to the\nmoon, and we even saw them in a part of\nthe cave where the moon could be seen.\nPeople say that happiness comes to those\nwho see Clefairy dance.
P177_Info_00	Tentacruel use ultrasonic waves to\ninvestigate their surroundings and emit\nlight from their heads to signal danger.\nThey seemed to react to the NEO-ONE’s\nscans—maybe they felt familiar to them!
P179_Info_00	When they’re sleeping, Geodude look so\nmuch like rocks that it’s hard to even notice\nthem! Apparently, they’re proud of their\nhard bodies and compete with each other\nto see who’s the toughest.
P181_Info_00	I’m sure you spotted Graveler curled up\nand rolling all over the place. It’s such a\nresilient Pokémon, it can even withstand\nthe heat of the volcano’s lava.
P184_Info_00	In Lental, picture books warn that Gengar\nwill pay a visit to children who are naughty.\nIt loves to use its powers to slip through\nwalls and other objects so it can play tricks\non people.
P185_Info_00	Starmie’s core will sometimes glow with\nthe seven colors of the rainbow. It’s said\nthat the light and signals it emits are its\nway of communicating with outer space.
P187_Info_00	Typhlosion can cause huge explosions by\nrubbing its blazing fur. It’s a rather violent\nPokémon—anything it doesn’t recognize, it\nburns to charcoal.
P188_Info_00	Sure, Crobat’s a speedy flier, but I hope you\nalso noticed how quiet its four wings are!\nIt sometimes lands to rest, but it’s not very\ngood at walking.
P189_Info_00	Lanturn’s antenna produces light in a way\nthat’s completely different from the\nIllumina phenomenon. Deep in the ocean,\nwhere sunlight doesn’t reach, Lanturn’s\nlight can guide you on your way.
P191_Info_00	Chinchou’s two antennae, which evolved\nfrom a fin, can light up from the electricity\nrunning through them. It flashes those\nlights to communicate with others.
P192_Info_00	Natu had no trouble getting around in the\nruins, despite their complexity. These\nPokémon aren’t able to fly yet, but they\nhave amazing jumping power.
P193_Info_00	Qwilfish swallows gallons of seawater to\ninflate itself to intimidate enemies. If it gets\nstartled, it spits out all that water and\nsends itself flying to who knows where.
P194_Info_00	That pack of Houndoom seemed to be\nworking together to protect the ruins.\nSome people say their eerie howls sound\nlike the grim reaper.
P196_Info_00	Lugia is said to be the guardian of the seas.\nIts power is so overwhelming that it usually\nstays in its home at the bottom of the sea,\nwhere it quietly sleeps.
P197_Info_00	The leaf on Lotad’s head is so heavy, it finds\nit easier to live floating in the water. It’s\nalso been known to let other Pokémon ride\non top of its head as it gives them a lift.
P198_Info_00	People say that if you find a feather from\none of Ho-Oh’s seven-colored wings,\nyou’ll be promised eternal happiness.\nHo-Oh looked so beautiful, sparkling and\nshining with each flap of its wings.
P199_Info_00	The other Pokémon in the woods all revere\nShiftry as a forest guardian. The storm of\nflower petals it whipped up with its fans\nwas really something else!
P200_Info_00	Celebi has the amazing ability to move\nthrough time. The area around the ruins\nmight be a special place to this Pokémon.
P202_Info_00	Those huge jaws on Mawile’s head are\nactually steel horns that have been\ntransformed. It seemed to take a while for\nit to warm up to you. Staring down the jaws\nof a wary Mawile isn’t my idea of fun!
P203_Info_00	The flames burning inside Torkoal’s shell\nare its life-force. It lives near the lava lake\nbecause the heat keeps its flames strong\nand healthy.
P204_Info_00	Gardevoir’s powers allow it to do things\nsuch as predict the future or make objects\nfloat in the air. In the forest, it was using its\npsychic power to entertain other Pokémon.
P207_Info_00	The hot springs help keep Altaria’s cottony\nwings nice and fluffy. This Pokémon loves\nmusic so much, it can’t help but hum along\nif it hears a melody.
P209_Info_00	Cradily’s body is so heavy, even rough seas\ncan’t wash it away. It can’t move very fast,\nso it hides among seaweed and reaches\nout with its tentacles to catch prey.
P210_Info_00	Kecleon can change their skin color to\nblend in with their surroundings and hide.\nThey live all over the forest. Did you spot\nthem all?
P216_Info_00	Jirachi’s wondrous power allows it to grant\nany wishes written on the notes attached to\nits head. I hardly dared hope when we first\nsaw its crystal shell, but I’m so glad we\nwere lucky enough to encounter it!
P217_Info_00	Monferno always want to be the strongest\nin their pack, so they like harsh\nenvironments that toughen them up! That’s\nwhy you can find them training in steep,\ndangerous places around the volcano.
P218_Info_00	Luxray is a Pokémon that behaves with\ngreat discipline. When it lost sight of Shinx,\nit used its ability to see through objects to\nquickly find it so they could be reunited.
P219_Info_00	Rampardos will headbutt anything. The\nimpact packs enough punch to make caves\nshake, but thanks to its thick, durable skull,\nit doesn’t injure itself at all.
P220_Info_00	It’s said that a Drifloon’s puffy body is\nfilled with countless souls. In the cave, we\nsaw one trying to carry a smaller Pokémon\naway somewhere.
P222_Info_00	Croagunk make distinctive sounds by\ninflating the poison sacs in their cheeks.\nWe saw some that were inflating their\ncheeks in a rhythmic way—almost as if\nthey were singing!
P223_Info_00	Lumineon uses the fins on its chest to\ndrag itself along the ocean floor, shuffling\nand sweeping sand away to reveal\nhiding Starmie.
P228_Info_00	Serperior’s haughty eyes can stop a foe\nin its tracks with just a glare. It’s a very\ncautious Pokémon and usually lives quietly\nin the ruins in the forest.
P230_Info_00	Male and female Unfezant work together\nto raise their young. One goes out in search\nof food while the other stays back at the\nnest to protect their eggs.
P231_Info_00	Woobat love dark environments. It looks\nlike they left those heart-shaped markings\non the ruin walls. They use the suction\nfrom their nostrils to stick themselves to\nwalls while they sleep.
P234_Info_00	The Sigilyph patrolling the Ruins of\nRemembrance let out a warning whenever\nit noticed anything. It must have been\nguarding those ruins for a very long time.
P235_Info_00	Archeops is a powerful runner, so it can\nescape from predators even if it’s on the\nground. It’s not great at flying, though, and\nit needs a running start before it takes off.
P238_Info_00	The Frillish drifting in the blue hole are\non the lookout for food. Sometimes the\nmales and females will work together to\ndrag other Pokémon down to the depths\nof the sea.
P239_Info_00	Did you notice the Joltik clinging to the\nother Pokémon in the cave? They can’t\nproduce a charge on their own, so they\nabsorb the static electricity from others.
P242_Info_00	Beheeyem and Golurk seemed to be\nstanding guard inside the ruins. Beheeyem\nlooked like it was giving orders by flashing\nlight from its fingertips, but deciphering\nthose patterns could be tough.
P244_Info_00	Hydreigon was very threatening as it\nguarded the underwater lake where it’s\nclaimed its territory. It has heads on its\narms, but apparently those heads can’t\nthink for themselves.
P246_Info_00	Pancham imitate other Pokémon to learn\nhow to grow strong. They may be easily\ndistracted, but they seem to be training\nas hard as they can under\nShiftry’s instruction.
P247_Info_00	This aerial hunter glides speedily down\nfrom a great height, then flies off clutching\nits prey. Its feathers are fireproof, so a\nTalonflame is just fine even if it’s near lava.
P249_Info_00	If you happened upon a floating boulder in\nthe forest, that was likely the work of\nEspurr training to get better control over\ntheir psychic powers!
P251_Info_00	Clawitzer are very territorial, and they are\nknown to fight fiercely among each other.\nThe cannonballs of water that they launch\nfrom their claws can break through walls\nand shatter big boulders.
P252_Info_00	I suspect the Goodra in the cave lives near\nwater so it can moisten up its protective\ngoo when it needs to. Goodra are very\nkindhearted and do their best to protect\nother Pokémon.
P253_Info_00	It’s said that if anyone tries to harm the\nforest, Trevenant will trap them inside a\nthick fog. But it’s kind to forest-dwelling\nPokémon and others that it trusts.
P254_Info_00	Diancie possesses a wondrous power that\nallows it to compress carbon molecules in\nthe air into diamonds! When we saw it\nliving happily with Carbink, it looked just\nlike a princess.
P256_Info_00	The Salandit we saw were communicating\nwith each other as they searched for food.\nThey can’t stand Noivern, so they were\nconstantly sneaking around, hoping they\nwouldn’t get caught.
P257_Info_00	This Pokémon has a habit of hugging just\nabout anything. In Lental, Bewear tend to\nhibernate during the seasons when food\nis scarce.
P258_Info_00	This Pokémon meditates quietly on the\nocean floor so that it can grow stronger.\nA Golisopod that has trained with its allies\ncan slice a stone in half with one stroke.
P260_Info_00	Drampa lives a leisurely life in the forest\nshrouded in fog. Smaller Pokémon adore\nDrampa and can often be seen playing\nwith it.
P262_Info_00	People say that Absol can predict all sorts\nof disasters with its horn. It seemed to be\nprotecting you just as much as it was\nprotecting the ruins.
P263_Info_00	Deerling have different appearances\ndepending on the season. They usually\nstick close to Sawsbuck, but because\nthey’re so curious, they sometimes\nwander off on their own and get lost.
P264_Info_00	Golurk seemed to be taking orders from\nBeheeyem as they guarded the ruins.\nThey’re very mysterious, but the other\nPokémon seem to be quite friendly\nwith them.
P265_Info_00	Noivern was flying around the ruins,\nsearching everywhere for Salandit.\nThe ultrasonic waves it emits from its ears\nare powerful enough to destroy boulders.
P266_Info_00	Eldegoss looked so free, bobbing on the\nwind. I have a theory that the cotton it\nscatters helps keep Lental lush and green\nby spreading various plant seeds\nthroughout the islands.
P267_Info_00	As soon as an Applin is born, it burrows\ninto an apple, which it eats as it matures.\nIf it falls from a great height, it may pop\nout of its apple.
P268_Info_00	Silicobra is often hiding inside the sand,\nwaiting to catch some food. But it jumps\nright out of its hiding place when\nsomething catches its interest... It must be\na very curious Pokémon!
P269_Info_00	To protect itself while it sleeps, Snom ties\nitself to an icicle with some thread. When\nit’s startled, it’ll burrow right down into the\nsnow before you know it.
P270_Info_00	Anyone who messes with the snowfields\nwill have to deal with freezing scales\nunleashed by Frosmoth. But just watching\nits elegant fluttering can be wonderfully\ncalming and peaceful.
P271_Info_00	Pumpkaboo of several different sizes live \nin the Lental region. I’ve heard it said that\ntheir size depends on the number of souls\nthey have trapped inside them.
P271_Info_01	This Pumpkaboo doesn’t have many souls\ninside of it. It probably still enjoys just\nplaying around and pulling pranks on \nother Pokémon.
P271_Info_02	There must be a lot of souls inside this\nPumpkaboo. It’s probably really\nindustrious, working away by the light of\nits own glow inside dim caves.
P271_Info_03	This Pumpkaboo is just packed full of\nsouls! How do you suppose it managed\nto get so many?

SD_11_01_cs_003	Hey, Professor! It’s been a while!
SD_11_03_cs_001	Wow! You’ve really got an eye for this!
SD_11_03_cs_002	HEY!
SD_11_03_cs_003	Back off, kid! Get your own mentor!
SD_13_01_cs_001	Now that you’re all here, we can get started.
SD_13_01_cs_002	Listen up, team! I’m going to give you a breakdown of\nthe survey.
SD_14_02_cs_001	Observe!
CD_006_3A_00_001	Where’s that reading coming from?
CD_006_3A_00_002	Looks like it’s...right under you!
CD_006_3A_00_003	Follow that Milotic!
SD_15_01_cs_001	All right. On to the next site...
CD_008_3A_00_001	Hmmm... It couldn’t possibly\nbe in all that lava, could it?
CD_008_3A_00_002	Oh my! Two Volcarona?!
CD_008_3A_00_003	A {color[0000]}pair {color[ffff]}of Illumina Pokémon?\nIncredible!
CD_008_3A_00_004	They flew off down that tunnel!
CD_008_3A_00_005	Follow them!
SD_17_01_cs_004	That was awesome!
SD_17_01_cs_001	Get ready.
SD_17_01_cs_002	Because we’re going outside the travelogue...
SD_17_01_cs_003	and into uncharted territory!
CD_010_3A_00_001	Looks like your target is...
CD_010_3A_00_002	there!
CD_010_3A_00_003	Rushing up to it could be dangerous.
CD_010_3A_00_004	Be careful!
CD_010_3A_01_001	Well, there it went.
CD_010_3A_01_002	Before you return, could I trouble\nyou to make a quick detour?
CD_010_3A_01_003	Something caught my attention while\nyou were chasing after that Steelix.
CD_010_3A_01_004	Past that broken wall...
CD_010_3A_01_005	there appears to be a large\nopen area.
CD_010_3A_01_006	The scan says it’s not a natural\nformation—it’s {color[0000]}human-made{color[ffff]}.
CD_010_3A_01_007	It’s just begging to be explored!
CD_010_3A_01_008	Whoa! What is this place, Professor?
CD_010_3A_01_009	Hmmm...
CD_010_3A_01_010	I can’t say for sure, but I think it may be another\nruin connected to the Illumina Pokémon.
CD_010_3A_01_011	Look at that mural!
SD_19_01_cs_001	We have one more area to explore before our survey\ncomes to an end.
SD_19_01_cs_002	Ready for the final frontier?
CD_011_1A_00_001	Looks like the ruins have come\nto life.
CD_011_1A_00_002	Energy from each island seems\nto be flowing upward.
CD_011_1A_00_003	It looks like that’ll take you up.
CD_011_1A_00_004	So up we go!
CD_011_1A_00_005	I’ll set up a teleportation point at the top.\nWhy don’t you come back to camp for a bit.
CD_011_3A_00_001	Looks like that’s the source of\nthe reading, but it’s very faint.
CD_011_3A_00_002	What is that, anyway?
CD_011_3A_00_003	Incredible! This reading is\noff the charts!
CD_011_3A_00_004	That was it—the final {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]}\nwe’ve been searching for!
CD_011_3A_00_005	Go get ’em!
CD_011_3A_01_003	What just happened?
CD_011_3A_01_005	Let’s talk about it once you’re back.
SD_20_02_cs_001	You guys get it, right?
SD_20_02_cs_002	Get what?
SD_20_02_cs_003	Of course!
SD_20_02_cs_004	So obvious!
SD_20_02_cs_005	It’s so simple. Do you really not know, Professor?
SD_20_02_cs_011	Hmmm...
SD_20_02_cs_006	Pokémon can tell when someone really loves them!
SD_20_02_cs_007	And they return that love right back!
SD_20_02_cs_008	Right?
SD_20_02_cs_009	That must be from a study I haven’t read yet.
SD_20_02_cs_010	We have GOT to get you out of the lab more often.

C003_0183	Oh, right...
C003_0184	I remember...
C003_0185	There’s something there.
C003_0186	What could that be?
C003_0187	You mind?
C003_0188	Appreciated.

C003_0287	A new discovery!
C003_0288	A new record!
C003_0289	Your memory’s low!

C003_0300	Almost time to wrap up this trip.
C003_0301	You’re almost at the teleport.

C005_0220	What? What?!
C005_0221	Oh?

C005_0245	Uh, heh heh...
C005_0246	(sigh)
C005_0247	(deep sigh)
C005_0248	Phew.
C005_0249	Phew...
C005_0250	Mission complete!
C005_0251	As-SIS-tant!

C006_0043	Also...
C006_0044	All right.
C006_0045	All right!
C006_0046	But...
C006_0047	However...
C006_0048	Actually...
C006_0049	By the way...
C006_0050	Another thing...
C006_0051	There you have it.
C006_0052	I knew it.
C006_0053	No way!
C006_0054	Just now...
C006_0055	Earlier...
C006_0056	Later...

C006_0063	Here.
C006_0064	Look.
C006_0065	Did you know?
C006_0066	That’s the trick.
C006_0067	About this...
C006_0068	This place...
C006_0069	About that...
C006_0070	So, that...
C006_0071	Ah!
C006_0072	Oh!
C006_0073	Aaah!
C006_0074	That reminds me...
C006_0075	That’s right...
C006_0076	Looks like something’s there.
C006_0077	What is that?
C006_0078	If you don’t mind...
C006_0079	I’m counting on you.
C006_0080	I know you can do it!
C006_0081	Appreciated!

C006_0090	Yes.
C006_0091	Yup!
C006_0092	OK...
C006_0093	All right, all right.
C006_0094	OK now.
C006_0095	Mm-hmm.
C006_0096	Yep!
C006_0097	Yeah.
C006_0098	Yeah!
C006_0099	Right.
C006_0100	Got it.
C006_0101	Oh!
C006_0102	Sweet!
C006_0103	Well done.
C006_0104	Wow!
C006_0105	Oh, wow!
C006_0106	(excited awe)
C006_0107	Great job!
C006_0108	Not bad at all!
C006_0109	That’s it!
C006_0110	Excellent!
C006_0111	Fantastic!
C006_0112	Congrats.
C006_0113	Amazing job!
C006_0114	You did great.
C006_0115	Huh.
C006_0116	I see!
C006_0117	Interesting!
C006_0118	Nice!
C006_0119	Mm-hmm.
C006_0120	Thank goodness.
C006_0121	Oookay!
C006_0122	Thanks.
C006_0123	OK!
C006_0124	All right!
C006_0125	Let’s start!
C006_0126	Let’s try it!
C006_0127	(laugh to self)
C006_0128	Whatcha think?
C006_0129	Can’t wait!
C006_0130	Oh!
C006_0131	Whoa!
C006_0132	Huh.
C006_0133	Whaaa?!
C006_0134	No.
C006_0135	Wait, what?
C006_0136	What have we here?
C006_0137	What’s up?
C006_0138	What is it?
C006_0139	Hmm?
C006_0140	Wha—?
C006_0141	Hmmm...
C006_0142	Let’s see...
C006_0143	Well...
C006_0144	Hmmm.
C006_0145	How goes?
C006_0146	How’d it go?
C006_0147	Uh-huh?
C006_0148	You OK?
C006_0149	Really?
C006_0150	Sorry.
C006_0151	Huh.
C006_0152	Hmph.
C006_0153	Ah well...
C006_0154	Come on!
C006_0155	(frustration)
C006_0156	Uh— (cut off sharply, not drawn out)
C006_0157	(pain)
C006_0158	(laugh to self)
C006_0159	Haha!
C006_0160	Yeah!
C006_0161	Hm-hm-hmm.
C006_0162	Hahaha!
C006_0163	(awkward laugh)
C006_0164	(sigh)
C006_0165	(deep sigh)
C006_0166	(sigh)
C006_0167	Phew...
C006_0168	That’s it for this mission!
C006_0169	Now’s your chance!
C006_0170	Got it!
C006_0171	’Cause I’m a genius photographer!
C006_0172	Not bad.
C006_0173	Nice.
C006_0174	This is it!
C006_0175	Perfectly timed!
C006_0176	Oh-kay!
C006_0177	That’s the stuff!
C006_0178	Mm-hmm!
C006_0179	Hey.

ScenarioHudNavi_Lines.msbt
VC_001_1A_s00_001	That’s the entrance to\n{color[0000]}Florio Nature Park{color[ffff]}.
VC_001_1A_s00_002	The NEO-ONE will automatically\nfollow a set route.
VC_001_1A_s00_003	You can just focus on looking\naround and taking photos!
VC_001_1A_e00_001	That symbol marks the spot where\nyou’ll {color[0000]}teleport{color[ffff]} back to camp.
VC_001_1A_e00_002	Basically, it’s the end of the course.
VC_001_1A_e00_003	When you get back, I’ll take\na look at your photos!
VC_001_1A_e01_001	Looks like that Bidoof dam is finished!\nIt’s pretty sturdy—you can pass right over it!
VC_001_1B_s00_001	You might get to see a whole\nnew side of Pokémon at night.
VC_001_1B_s00_002	Watch for differences in their behavior!
VC_001_1B_e00_001	Hey, do you copy? We just picked up\na huge energy reading near you!
VC_001_1B_e00_002	The professor’s busy trying to make sense of the data.\nLet’s ask him about it when you get back!
VC_001_1C_e00_001	And off it goes.
VC_001_1C_e00_002	The energy reading is gone, too.\nLet’s chat when you get back.
VC_005_1A_s00_001	Enjoy your first time on {color[0000]}Belusylva Island{color[ffff]}!\nIt really is a jungle out there!
VC_005_1A_s00_002	Keep your eyes peeled and your camera\nready for Pokémon! Good luck!
VC_005_1A_e01_001	Hey, good eye! Now we can get a closer\nlook at those swamp Pokémon!
VC_005_1A_e02_001	Wow, you can get behind the waterfall!\nI wonder what it’s like back there!
VC_005_1B_s00_001	It’s pretty dark out there. You might\nhave a hard time finding Pokémon.
VC_005_1B_s00_002	Look for a glowing {color[0000]}crystabloom{color[ffff]}\nfor me, would you?
VC_006_1A_s00_001	That’s some thick fog.
VC_006_1A_s00_002	Our connection seems a little\nspotty, too. Be careful!
VC_006_1A_e00_001	Doesn’t this flower only bloom in spring?\nI’m confused—did the season change?
VC_006_1A_e01_001	You getting hot? The professor\nsays it’s like summer out there!
VC_006_1A_e02_001	What’s going on with this forest?\nIt’s definitely fall here, isn’t it.
VC_006_1A_e03_001	Wait a minute—is it snowing?\nGuess it must be winter over there...
VC_006_1A_e04_001	This spot just feels...peaceful.\nDon’t you think?
VC_006_3A_e00_001	Looks like it’s swimming away.
VC_006_3A_e00_002	Come on back for now.
VC_006_3A_e01_001	If it’d just surface, I’m sure you could\nuse an Illumina orb!
VC_006_3A_e01_002	I bet a fluffruit could reach it down there!
VC_006_3A_e01_003	Snap a shot when its glowing\npattern appears!
VC_003_1A_s00_001	What a warm and relaxing place!
VC_003_1A_s00_002	I think you’re in for some fun\nphoto sessions here.
VC_003_2A_s00_001	Ahh, that’s a great view.
VC_003_2A_s00_002	Makes me want to go for a swim.
VC_003_2A_e00_001	An underwater crater! These are also\ncalled “blue holes”—did you know that?
VC_004_1A_s00_001	It’s stunning down here!
VC_004_1A_s00_002	Even underwater, you can still take\npictures like you normally would.
VC_004_1A_e00_001	Look how the light shines down here.\nIt’s the best part of underwater photography!
VC_004_1A_e01_001	Quick, that way! There’s gotta be\nsomething up ahead!
VC_004_3A_e00_001	Are you OK?!
VC_004_3A_e00_002	Thank goodness!
VC_004_3A_e00_003	The NEO-ONE’s fine, too!
VC_004_3A_e00_004	I think that was the\n{color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]}.
VC_004_3A_e00_005	You good to go after it?
VC_004_3A_e00_006	All right! Take a careful\nlook around!
VC_004_3A_e01_001	That was quite a surprise.
VC_004_3A_e01_002	I’m not picking up any more readings\nnear you. Come on back when you can.
VC_004_3A_e02_001	Hey, maybe try making all those\nWishiwashi glow!
VC_004_3A_e02_002	Try throwing a few Illumina orbs\nat that big Wishiwashi!
VC_004_3A_e02_003	You gotta get a shot of it when\nthe pattern’s glowing!
VC_003_1B_s00_001	Wow! The ocean is just as pretty\nat night!
VC_003_1B_s00_002	I wonder what the Pokémon are doing...
VC_003_2B_s00_001	Oh wow, look at that sunset.
VC_003_2B_s00_002	See? I told you it was gonna\nbe gorgeous!
VC_007_1A_s00_001	Sand, sand, and more sand...\nSeems like a gritty environment.
VC_007_1A_s00_002	I imagine Pokémon live differently\nhere than on the other islands.
VC_007_1A_e01_001	Wait, where’d the Pokémon from before go?\nOh well—now’s your chance to get farther in!
VC_007_1B_s00_001	The stars are breathtaking.
VC_007_1B_s00_002	I suppose the sky is clearer at\nnight than during the day.
VC_008_1A_s00_001	Seems sweltering hot out there.\nIs that a hot spring?
VC_008_1A_s00_002	You’ll be able to see the volcano\nup ahead.
VC_008_1A_e00_001	The professor says he’s picking up\na weird reading from in there.
VC_008_3A_e00_001	The reading from those\ntwo Pokémon is gone.
VC_008_3A_e00_002	I guess that’s it for now.
VC_008_3A_e01_001	Maybe Illumina orbs will work\nonce those flames are put out.
VC_008_3A_e01_002	You might be able to put out the flames\nif you throw fluffruit at ’em!
VC_008_3A_e01_003	Get a shot when the pattern\nstarts glowing!
VC_009_1A_s00_001	Amazing! So this is what snow is like!\nI actually haven’t seen much myself.
VC_009_1A_s00_002	Looks like a lot of Pokémon\nlive even in this frigid place!
VC_009_1A_e00_001	Hey! The screen just went completely\nwhite. What happened?
VC_009_1A_e01_001	Wow! A cavern made of ice.\nIt’s so pretty!
VC_009_1B_s00_001	That cold is no joke! The great outdoors\ndoesn’t pull any punches!
VC_009_1B_s00_002	I can’t wait to see some shots with\nthe moonlight glinting off the snow!
VC_010_1A_s00_001	That’s a big cavern!
VC_010_1A_s00_002	Get ready—you’ve got a long\nway down.
VC_010_1A_e00_001	Good find! I’m picking up massive heat\nreadings through there. What could it be?
VC_010_1A_e01_001	Just look at that beautiful rimstone...\nI wonder how many years it took to form.
VC_010_1A_e02_001	Now we can see what’s on the other side of\nthat wall. I wonder what Pokémon live there.
VC_010_3A_e00_001	The mural’s very old, and it’s missing\nsome pieces here and there.
VC_010_3A_e00_002	But it must be depicting that\nancient Lental legend.
VC_010_3A_e00_003	Let’s see...\nIt looks like it’s roughly...
VC_010_3A_e00_004	2,000 years old?!
VC_010_3A_e00_005	Jeez! You startled me.
VC_010_3A_e00_006	Is it really that old?
VC_010_3A_e00_007	It must have been made around\nthe time the meteorite hit!
VC_010_3A_e00_008	Fantastic! What a discovery!
VC_010_3A_e00_009	Does this show what the people saw\nback then?
VC_010_3A_e00_010	So...the Pokémon are protecting\nthem from the meteorite?
VC_010_3A_e00_011	Hmm. The patterns on these Pokémon...\nCould they be {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]}?
VC_010_3A_e00_012	Did Illumina Pokémon exist before\nthe meteorite fell after all?
VC_010_3A_e00_013	And was there another Illumina\nPokémon in the center?
VC_010_3A_e00_014	Hmmm...
VC_010_3A_e00_015	Professor?
VC_010_3A_e00_016	Hmmm...
VC_010_3A_e00_017	Oh, sorry.
VC_010_3A_e00_018	I got a bit lost in thought.
VC_010_3A_e00_019	I’ve got some good data for now.\nLet’s sort it out once you’re back.
VC_010_3A_e01_001	The reading is getting farther away.
VC_010_3A_e01_002	Maybe you’ll get its {color[0000]}Illumina state{color[ffff]} next time.\nWhy don’t you return for now?
VC_010_3A_e02_001	It must be in one of those holes, right?\nTry throwing fluffruit in them!
VC_010_3A_e02_002	Maybe it takes a few Illumina orbs\nto light up since it’s so big.
VC_010_3A_e02_003	I think it’s under there! Quick, run a scan!\nMaybe it’ll come up for some fluffruit?
VC_010_3A_e02_004	Snap a shot when the glowing\npattern appears!
VC_011_1A_s00_001	What massive ruins.
VC_011_1A_s00_002	The reading was coming from\ndeeper inside. Be careful.
VC_011_3A_e00_001	The reading disappeared.
VC_011_3A_e00_002	Too bad you couldn’t get a shot of Xerneas in its\n{color[0000]}Illumina state{color[ffff]}. Why don’t you return for now.
VC_011_3A_e01_001	What would happen if you hit that\nglow with an Illumina orb?
VC_011_3A_e01_002	An Illumina orb might be able to\nenergize Xerneas.
VC_011_3A_e01_003	Once its glowing pattern appears,\nthat’s your cue to start snapping!
VC_Com_StartChange_001	Hmmm. Is it just me, or do things seem\na little different this time around?
VC_Com_StartChange_002	You might discover something\nnew here.
VC_Com_StartChange_003	It’s looking a little different from\nthe last time you came here.
VC_Com_StartChange_004	The Pokémon are looking active!
VC_Com_StartChange_005	This is just a hunch...but I have a\nfeeling you’ll find something new!
VC_Com_StartCom_001	As always, thanks for going\nout there!
VC_Com_StartCom_002	Do your best!
VC_Com_StartCom_003	Be careful out there!
VC_Com_StartCom_004	Let the research begin!
VC_Com_StartCom_005	You can do it!
VC_Com_StartCom_006	Have fun out there!
VC_Com_StartCom_007	It’s research time!
VC_Com_StartCom_008	You got this!
VC_Com_StartCom_009	Go get ’em!
VC_Com_StartCom_010	Off you go!
VC_Com_StartCom_011	You can do it!
VC_Com_StartCom_012	I’m looking forward to seeing\nsome great photos!
VC_Com_EndCom_001	See you shortly!
VC_Com_EndCom_002	The return system is ready to go!\nInitiating teleportation!
VC_Com_EndCom_003	The NEO-ONE is all set to return!
VC_Com_EndCom_004	We got to see a lot of Pokémon\nthis time, too!
VC_Com_EndCom_005	Yeah! That was fun!
VC_Com_EndCom_006	All right! The NEO-ONE is set\nto return!
VC_Com_EndCom_007	The adventure’s not done till you\nget back!
VC_Com_EndCom_008	Hurry! I wanna see your photos!
VC_Com_EndCom_009	Aw, man! Done already?
VC_Com_EndCom_010	Did you enjoy yourself?
VC_Com_EndCom_011	See you back at camp!
VC_Com_EndCom_012	Get any nice shots?
VC_Com_SoonEnd_001	Almost done.
VC_Com_SoonEnd_002	You’re almost at the teleport point.
VC_Com_SoonEnd_003	You’re almost at the end of\nthe course.
VC_Com_SearchReact_001	Try running a scan!
VC_Com_SearchReact_002	The scan is picking up on something!
VC_Com_SearchReact_003	Maybe try a scan?
VC_Com_SearchReact_004	Hey, you can run a scan!
VC_Com_SearchReact_005	See anything?
VC_Com_SearchReact_006	Wouldn’t hurt to try a scan!
VC_Com_PhotoLimit_001	Careful there! You’re running low\non memory.
VC_Com_PhotoLimit_002	You’ve taken a lot of photos! Careful\nof how much memory you have left!
VC_Com_PhotoLimit_003	You only have a few shots left.\nBe careful, or you’ll run out of memory.
VC_Com_PhotoLimitZero01_001	That’s all your memory. But since it’s\nyour first time here, let’s see it through.
VC_Com_PhotoLimitZero01_002	Uh-oh, no more memory. But you may as well\nsee the whole area, since it’s your first time.
VC_Com_PhotoLimitZero01_003	That was your last photo. But let’s\npress on this time anyway.
VC_Com_PhotoLimitZero01_004	Oops! No more photos. Oh well—let’s\nsee this one through to the end.
VC_Com_PhotoLimitZero02_001	You’ve run out of memory. Let’s call\nthat enough research for now.
VC_Com_PhotoLimitZero02_002	Oops, that’s all your memory.\nWrap it up and come on back.
VC_Com_SelectBranch_001	Go go go!
VC_Com_SelectBranch_002	So you chose that path!
VC_Com_SelectBranch_003	I wonder what we’ll see.
VC_Com_SelectBranch_004	Here we go!
VC_Com_SelectBranch_005	Going that route, huh?
VC_Com_SelectBranch_006	Think there’s something there?
VC_Com_TimGP_001	Great! Nice timing!
VC_Com_TimGP_002	What a well-timed shot!
VC_Com_TimGP_003	You really nailed the timing\non that one!
VC_Com_TimGP_004	Yes! Good eye!
VC_Com_TimGP_005	Wow! That was some\ngood technique!
VC_Com_Praise1_001	I bet that one turned out great!
VC_Com_Praise1_002	Oooh, nice!
VC_Com_Praise1_003	Nice shot!
VC_Com_Praise1_004	Oh, wow! I bet that shot’s\ngonna be fantastic!
VC_Com_Praise1_005	It was looking your way\njust now!
VC_Com_Praise1_006	That was amazing!
VC_Com_Praise2_001	Whoa, you got a good\none there!
VC_Com_Praise2_002	Not bad!
VC_Com_Praise2_003	Just you wait! I’m gonna get\nan even better shot than that!
VC_Com_Praise2_004	Haha! Smack-dab in the middle!
VC_Com_Praise2_005	Aw, I wish I coulda gotten\nthat shot!
VC_Com_Praise2_006	Man! You always get the\nbest shots!
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_001	It doesn’t look like it was cooked over a fire...\nCan you guess which Pokémon did this?
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_002	Is something sleeping\nunder there?
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_003	That’s one of the ancient ruins.
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_006	I bet there’s a Pokémon\nthat loves stuff like that!
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_007	What a beautiful singing voice...\nI can’t stop listening to it.
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_008	Cool! I wonder what kind\nof Pokémon did that.
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_009	Long ago, this area may have\nbeen dry land...
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_010	That’s one of the ancient ruins.
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_011	That’s one of the ancient ruins.
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_012	If only we could get over there! Think\nany Pokémon could break that down?
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_013	That’s one of the ancient ruins.
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_014	If only that Liepard would\nmove out of the way...
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_017	That’s one of the ancient ruins.
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_018	That’s one of the ancient ruins.
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_019	All right! Let’s keep\nlooking around!
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_020	Hm? I think I saw something\nmove in there.
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_024	That explains the Aerodactyl...
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_025	That’s one of the ancient ruins.
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_026	That’s one of the ancient ruins.
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_029	That’s one of the ancient ruins.
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_031	Did it start glowing because\nof the Illumina energy?
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_032	That’s one of the ancient ruins.
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_033	Something’s gonna come\noutta there!
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_034	Here it comes!
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_035	That’s one of the ancient ruins.
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_036	So energy from all of the islands\ngathers here?
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_037	Are the crystablooms we saw on each island\nsomehow connected to the statue?
VC_Com_SearchAnalysis_038	So that missing piece in the\ncenter was Xerneas...

SD_01_02_sk_001	Hi there! I’m glad you made it.
SD_01_02_sk_015	Welcome to the {color[0000]}Laboratory of Ecology and Natural\nSciences{color[ffff]}—or {color[0000]}L.E.N.S.{color[ffff]} for short!
SD_01_02_sk_002	My name is {color[0000]}Mirror{color[ffff]}.
SD_01_02_sk_003	I’m researching Pokémon and their natural environment\nhere on {color[0000]}Florio Island{color[ffff]}.
SD_01_02_sk_004	Yeah, and that’s not all! The professor’s gonna study\nevery single island here in the {color[0000]}Lental region{color[ffff]}!
SD_01_02_sk_005	No one’s ever done an ecological survey like this before!\nIt’s gonna be amazing!
SD_01_02_sk_016	No one? Aren’t you forgetting a certain explorer?
SD_01_02_sk_006	Oops! Good point!\nYou’ve read the stories of {color[0000]}Captain Vince{color[ffff]}, haven’t you?
SD_01_02_sk_007	But even counting him, Professor, your survey’s gonna be\nthe first of its kind in a hundred years! That’s awesome!
SD_01_02_sk_008	Well, thanks.
SD_01_02_sk_009	This is {color[0000]}Rita{color[ffff]}. Her parents are good friends of mine.\nShe’s here on vacation while her school’s on break.
SD_01_02_sk_010	I’m not just here to goof off, Professor! I’m your\nresearch assistant!
SD_01_02_sk_011	Ah, yes, that’s right. And I appreciate the help.
SD_01_02_sk_012	Now, before we go over what you’ll be doing in\nthis program...
SD_01_02_sk_013	why don’t we step into the lab to get settled?
SD_01_02_sk_014	Right you are, Professor! I’ll lead the way!
SD_01_03_sk_001	All right. Allow me to explain.
SD_01_03_sk_002	The {color[0000]}Lental region{color[ffff]} is absolutely teeming with Pokémon.
SD_01_03_sk_003	Photographing those Pokémon helps us learn more\nabout them and their ecosystem.
SD_01_03_sk_004	And that’s exactly what you’re here to do!
SD_01_03_sk_005	At night, you might even get to see {color[0000]}glowing Pokémon{color[ffff]}.\nThey’re really pretty!
SD_01_03_sk_006	Now, without further ado, here’s your {color[0000]}research camera{color[ffff]}.
SD_01_03_sk_007	I’ve got the same one! We can use them to communicate\nwith each other and the rest of the team, too.
SD_01_03_sk_008	That’s right—it’s more than just a camera. It lets you\nkeep in touch and analyze data on the fly.
SD_01_03_sk_009	It’ll also serve as a sort of ID badge for you here, so take\ngood care of it.
SD_01_04b_sk_001	Awesome, right?!
SD_01_04b_sk_002	The professor invented it!
SD_01_04b_sk_003	Can I explain how to use it, Professor?
SD_01_04b_sk_004	Sure thing, Rita. Assist away. I’ll go take care of some\nother preparations.
SD_01_04b_sk_005	All right! C’mon, let’s go outside!
SD_01_06_sk_001	That should about do it.
SD_01_06_sk_002	See this pod? It’ll carry you on your\nphotography expeditions.
SD_01_06_sk_003	It’s called the {color[0000]}NEO-ONE{color[ffff]}!
SD_01_06_sk_004	It’s the best! It can teleport to far-off places in no\ntime flat!
SD_01_06_sk_005	I finally put the finishing touches on it not long ago, with\na little help from someone I know.
SD_01_06_sk_006	You see, it makes use of energy hot spots scattered\nthroughout the Lental region—
SD_01_06_sk_007	Come on, Professor! The details can wait!
SD_01_06_sk_008	Fair enough. Let’s get you moving. Climb on in, and touch\nyour camera to the console!
SD_03_01_sk_001	That covers just about everything.
SD_03_01_sk_002	Can we go on a nighttime photo shoot later?
SD_03_01_sk_003	Not yet but soon—after a little more practice.
SD_03_01_sk_004	By the way, don’t forget you can come back to the {color[0000]}lab{color[ffff]}\nand take a look at your {color[0000]}Photodex {color[ffff]}anytime.
SD_03_01_sk_005	I’ll explain more about that when you stop by the lab.
SD_03_01_sk_006	Well, don’t let me keep you any longer! Go have a good\ntime, and snap some photos!
SD_04_01_sk_001	This is the professor’s lab.
SD_04_01_sk_002	Not that it’s your first time here, of course.
SD_04_01_sk_003	This is where the professor does his research and\nworks on mechanical stuff.
SD_04_01_sk_004	In fact, he pretty much lives here...
SD_04_01_sk_005	Anyway, let me give you a quick rundown of what you can\ndo here!
SD_04_01_sk_006	That server over there is where we store our\nresearch work.
SD_04_01_sk_007	There are a few things you can do with all that data.
SD_04_01_sk_008	First, you can check your {color[0000]}Photodex{color[ffff]}.
SD_04_01_sk_009	That’s the encyclopedic record you’re building with the\nphotos you’re taking.
SD_04_01_sk_010	Isn’t it cool getting to put together your very\nown Photodex?
SD_04_01_sk_011	Next, there’s {color[0000]}Your Space{color[ffff]}.
SD_04_01_sk_012	That’s where you can see your personal photo album\nand adventure milestones.
SD_04_01_sk_013	Your {color[0000]}album{color[ffff]} is for photos you want to keep but not put in\nyour Photodex.
SD_04_01_sk_014	You can {color[0000]}edit {color[ffff]}your album photos in some cool ways, too!
SD_04_01_sk_015	Hmm. Am I forgetting anything?
SD_04_01_sk_016	Hey, Professor? Was there anything else I was supposed\nto mention?
SD_04_01_sk_017	Did you cover what we can do on the internet?
SD_04_01_sk_018	Oh, yeah! That was it!
SD_04_01_sk_019	If you use the online {color[0000]}Internet{color[ffff]} feature, you can see photos\nfrom players all around the world.
SD_04_01_sk_020	If you really like a photo, you can tell the photographer\n“Nice job!” by giving the photo a little digital medal!
SD_04_01_sk_025	They’re called {color[0000]}Sweet! medals{color[ffff]}. Give all you want—people\nlove getting ’em!
SD_04_01_sk_021	That’s right. You can also see other photographers’\n{color[0000]}rankings in each score category{color[ffff]}.
SD_04_01_sk_022	All right, I think that’s everything!
SD_04_01_sk_023	I’m sure you’ll figure it all out quick!
SD_04_01_sk_024	Don’t be shy—try everything out!
SD_05_01_sk_001	Are you headed out on another expedition already?
SD_05_01_sk_002	Before you go, let me tell you one more thing you can do\nwith your research camera.
SD_05_01_sk_003	You can run a {color[0000]}scan{color[ffff]}!
SD_05_01_sk_004	That’ll give you details about your surroundings.
SD_05_01_sk_005	It tells you about nearby Pokémon and points out\nanything unusual.
SD_05_01_sk_006	Professor, what counts as “unusual”? You’ve never given\nme a solid answer.
SD_05_01_sk_007	Basically, anything that makes the system go,\n“Check this out!”
SD_05_01_sk_008	Well, I guess that’s all the detail we’re gonna get.
SD_05_01_sk_009	You’ll get the hang of it once you try it. Rita, would you\nmind demonstrating?
SD_05_01_sk_010	Leave it to me, Professor! All right—get that\ncamera ready!
SD_05_03_sk_001	Hey, Professor! Explanation’s all done!
SD_05_03_sk_002	Thanks, Rita.
SD_05_03_sk_003	Don’t hesitate to run a scan. It’ll tell you a lot about\nyour surroundings.
SD_06_01_sk_001	Your photography seems to be going well.
SD_06_01_sk_002	I think you’re about ready for a nighttime visit to\nFlorio Nature Park.
SD_06_01_sk_003	Hopefully, you’ll get to see one of Lental’s greatest\nwonders: a glow called the {color[0000]}Illumina phenomenon{color[ffff]}.
SD_06_01_sk_004	You’re the one who discovered how that glow happens,\nright, Professor?
SD_06_01_sk_005	Yes, I am. But explaining the process scientifically\nwas just one step toward my ultimate goal:
SD_06_01_sk_006	finding the special Pokémon spoken of in the legends\nof Lental.
SD_06_01_sk_007	You mean the {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]}?
SD_06_01_sk_008	I thought they were made up.
SD_06_01_sk_009	No, they’re very much real. You’ve seen the photos from\nCaptain Vince’s travelogue, haven’t you?
SD_06_01_sk_010	You can barely tell what’s in those photos! And they’re\nancient, anyway—literally a hundred years old!
SD_06_01_sk_011	Well, we can discuss that later.
SD_06_01_sk_012	For now, enjoy your nighttime outing!
SD_07_02_sk_001	When you got near that field of flowers...
SD_07_02_sk_002	I picked up an incredibly strong energy reading.
SD_07_02_sk_003	Its source seemed to be moving, too—if only slightly.
SD_07_02_sk_004	Which suggests what we’ve got here is—
SD_07_02_sk_005	An {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]}?!
SD_07_02_sk_006	We can’t be sure yet, but I suspect so.
SD_07_02_sk_007	I wonder why it showed up. Did you do anything special?
SD_07_02_sk_008	I also doubt that it appeared when it did by chance.
SD_07_02_sk_009	So I think you should be the one to investigate the area\nwhere that reading is coming from.
SD_07_02_sk_010	Aww, I wanna go see, too!
SD_07_02_sk_011	You can watch through the monitor with me, Rita.
SD_07_02_sk_012	Please head out as soon as you’re ready.
SD_08_01_sk_001	Yes! You’re back!
SD_08_01_sk_002	That was amazing, right? Wasn’t it gorgeous? Wasn’t it\nhuge? And was it...saying something?
SD_08_01_sk_003	Easy there, Rita. Take a deep breath.
SD_08_01_sk_004	Look who’s talking! You were practically\ndancing, Professor!
SD_08_01_sk_005	Ahem. Moving on...
SD_08_01_sk_006	There’s no doubt about it—that Meganium was an\n{color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]}, just like in the legends!
SD_08_01_sk_007	Remind me what the legends say about Illumina\nPokémon again, Professor.
SD_08_01_sk_008	Didn’t they supposedly save Lental from a huge disaster\na long time ago or something?
SD_08_01_sk_009	So the story goes, yes.
SD_08_01_sk_010	Illumina Pokémon were also said to have distinctive\n{color[0000]}patterns{color[ffff]} and to glow with {color[0000]}unusual light{color[ffff]}...
SD_08_01_sk_011	Sounds like our new friend!
SD_08_01_sk_012	Yes, to the letter.
SD_08_01_sk_013	I’m convinced the events in those legends really\ndid happen.
SD_08_01_sk_014	And discovering the true history of this region could be\nthe key that opens up all our research!
SD_08_01_sk_015	Hang on—wasn’t there one more important thing you\nwere gonna mention, Professor?
SD_08_01_sk_016	That’s all right. It’s pretty late. Let’s pick up the\nconversation from here tomorrow.
SD_09_01_sk_001	Good morning! Did you manage to get some sleep?
SD_09_01_sk_002	Now, as Rita already told you...
SD_09_01_sk_003	I’ve been preparing to launch an ecological survey\nspanning the entire Lental region.
SD_09_01_sk_004	And no sooner had you arrived than we suddenly found\nan {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]}!
SD_09_01_sk_005	You think there’s a connection, Professor?
SD_09_01_sk_006	I can’t be sure yet.
SD_09_01_sk_007	But fascinating things are bound to happen if you come\nwith us!
SD_09_01_sk_008	Really?!
SD_09_01_sk_009	Well, you know. Maybe.
SD_09_01_sk_010	For a scientist, you sure can be vague\nsometimes, Professor.
SD_09_01_sk_011	Still, I think it’s a good idea!
SD_09_01_sk_012	It’ll be way more fun with you along!
SD_09_01_sk_013	Well, there you have it. Ready to officially join our\nresearch team?
SD_09_03_sk_001	It’s like you were born to wear it.
SD_09_03_sk_002	Well, what are we waiting for?! Adventure awaits!
SD_09_03_sk_003	Not to rain on your parade, Rita...
SD_09_03_sk_004	but I need to get a couple more things ready first.
SD_09_03_sk_005	Awww, come on!
SD_09_03_sk_006	Just a little bit longer, all right? I promise it’ll be worth\nthe wait.
SD_09_03_sk_007	I’ll explain next time you’re headed out to do\nsome research.
SD_10_01_sk_001	Now that you’re a full-fledged team member, I have\nsomething for you that’ll come in handy!
SD_10_01_sk_002	As for the explanation...\nWould you do the honors, Rita?
SD_10_01_sk_003	Yes, sir!
SD_10_01_sk_004	But is it just me...or have you been getting me to do a lot\nmore of the work lately, Professor?
SD_10_01_sk_005	Oh well. Time to explain like the great assistant I am!
SD_10_01_sk_006	This is a {color[0000]}fluffruit{color[ffff]}. They grow here in the Lental region.
SD_10_01_sk_007	They’re sweet and tasty, and they make a great snack\nfor Pokémon!
SD_10_01_sk_008	They may look just like regular apples...
SD_10_01_sk_009	but they’re way lighter and softer!
SD_10_01_sk_010	You’ll probably make a Pokémon’s day if you toss it one\nof these.
SD_10_01_sk_011	Let’s get you some practice!
SD_10_03_sk_001	Pretty easy, right?
SD_10_03_sk_002	I think that should be all you need to know.
SD_10_03_sk_003	So I guess now we just wait until the professor gives us\nthe green light to move on.
SD_10_03_sk_004	Oh, I’ve got an idea!
SD_10_03_sk_005	You should try testing out fluffruit and taking some more\nphotos in the meantime!
SD_10_03_sk_006	The professor says there are all kinds of ways to use it.
SD_10_03_sk_007	Finished explaining, I see!\nThanks, Rita.
SD_10_03_sk_008	I’ve got one more thing to tell you about for now.
SD_10_03_sk_009	I thought it would be handy to have a quick way to share\nwhat we see and learn in the field.
SD_10_03_sk_010	Are you two familiar with {color[0000]}LenTalk{color[ffff]}?
SD_10_03_sk_011	It rings a bell, I think...
SD_10_03_sk_012	It’s a communication tool folks here in Lental use.
SD_10_03_sk_013	Rita, let’s say you notice something exciting in the field.\nYou can send a photo and a description over LenTalk!
SD_10_03_sk_014	I can use it to send things I notice on the monitor, too.
SD_10_03_sk_015	That sounds super fun!
SD_10_03_sk_016	Look for LenTalk messages in the {color[0000]}top right{color[ffff]} of the screen\nat the research camp and elsewhere. They ought to help!
SD_11_02_sk_001	This is {color[0000]}Todd{color[ffff]}.
SD_11_02_sk_002	He’s a professional Pokémon photographer. His work\ntakes him all over the world!
SD_11_02_sk_003	Are you the one who caught an {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]} on\ncamera? Way to go—that’s a big deal!
SD_11_02_sk_004	Todd, did you bring what I asked you to?
SD_11_02_sk_005	I sure did.
SD_11_02_sk_006	You’re a lifesaver. Now we’ll finally be able to set out!
SD_11_02_sk_007	Is this guy a friend of yours, Professor?
SD_11_02_sk_008	An old travel companion, to be precise.
SD_11_02_sk_009	He’s been helping me plan our big survey of Lental, too.
SD_11_02_sk_010	No kidding!
SD_11_02_sk_011	Oooh, is that the new pod you put together? Reminds me\nof the good old days!
SD_11_02_sk_012	But hey, let me see those Illumina Pokémon photos!
SD_11_04_sk_001	So you’re the new teammate, huh?\nI’m {color[0000]}Phil{color[ffff]}—Todd’s number-one student!
SD_11_04_sk_002	Easy there, Phil.
SD_11_04_sk_003	I’m tempted to take part in this big ecological survey\nmyself, but I have another idea.
SD_11_04_sk_004	How about I send Phil with you instead?
SD_11_04_sk_005	I’m fine with that if you are, Todd.
SD_11_04_sk_006	Yesss! Awesome!
SD_11_04_sk_007	You can be my stand-in for now, but don’t forget, I’ll need\nthat {color[0000]}badge {color[ffff]}back eventually.
SD_11_04_sk_008	Aw, fine... But if I take a supercool photo, I get to keep\nthe badge!
SD_11_04_sk_009	So, yeah...what’s an ecological survey?
SD_11_04_sk_010	...
SD_13_02_sk_001	This is {color[0000]}Florio Island{color[ffff]}—our home, sweet home. The\ncircled spot right here is our camp.
SD_13_02_sk_002	But this survey will take us past these shores.
SD_13_02_sk_003	And this’ll be our first destination!
SD_13_02_sk_004	Why are we starting there?
SD_13_02_sk_005	I’ve detected a spot there with high energy readings.\nThe NEO-ONE should be able to teleport to it.
SD_13_02_sk_006	This island showed up in the travelogue, right?
SD_13_02_sk_007	It certainly did! Captain Vince wrote that he saw a\nglowing Pokémon there, too, in fact.
SD_13_02_sk_008	C’mon already! Let’s get this survey thing started!
SD_13_02_sk_009	Fair enough.
SD_13_02_sk_010	Enjoy your first-in-a-century adventure into the wilds\nof Lental!
CI_005_1B_00_001	Looks like you’re finding your feet on the new island!
CI_005_1B_00_002	It’s about time I gave you your next task.
CI_005_1B_00_003	Ooh, what is it? What is it?!
CI_005_1B_00_004	I’d like you to visit the jungle during the night and\nphotograph a {color[0000]}crystabloom {color[ffff]}glowing in the dark.
CI_005_1B_00_005	What’s a crystabloom?
CI_005_1B_00_006	It’s a type of flower that can give off light.
CI_005_1B_00_007	Do you remember seeing any odd flowers out there?
CI_005_1B_00_008	Oh, yeah—I did! Red ones!
CI_005_1B_00_009	That’s probably the type we’re after.
CI_005_1B_00_010	If you see one lit up at night, it’s in what we call the\n{color[0000]}Illumina state{color[ffff]}.
CI_005_1B_00_011	Do we need to do anything special if we find one?
CI_005_1B_00_012	Not particularly. Just snap a photo of it.
CI_005_1B_00_013	Your camera can analyze it for you.
CI_005_1B_00_014	That should be all you need to know for now. Enjoy{color[0000]} {color[ffff]}the\n{color[0000]}nighttime jungle{color[ffff]}!
SD_14_01_sk_001	Great job! Your photos gave us plenty of data to\nwork with.
SD_14_01_sk_002	Now, I’ve got something new to show you.\nTake a look.
SD_14_01_sk_003	Oh, are those the orb thingies you’ve been working\non, Professor?
SD_14_01_sk_004	Didn’t you say they could make Pokémon and\ncrystablooms glow?
SD_14_01_sk_005	Exactly. I call them {color[0000]}Illumina orbs{color[ffff]}.
SD_14_01_sk_006	Unfortunately, blue Illumina orbs only work here on\nFlorio Island.
SD_14_01_sk_007	What? How come?
SD_14_01_sk_008	I suspect it’s because different areas of Lental have\ndistinct types of energy flowing through them.
SD_14_01_sk_009	But for now, want to see the fruits of your research\nin action?
SD_14_01_sk_010	Watch this!
SD_14_03_sk_001	That was awesome!
SD_14_03_sk_002	Oh my gosh! It’s so pretty!
SD_14_03_sk_003	Wow—Lental’s very own light show!
SD_14_03_sk_004	What did you call it again? The {color[0000]}Illumina phenomenon{color[ffff]}?
SD_14_03_sk_005	It’s interesting how it can occur in both Pokémon\nand plants.
SD_14_03_sk_006	You can use these orbs to send Pokémon and\ncrystablooms into the {color[0000]}Illumina state{color[ffff]} for a little while.
SD_14_03_sk_007	When you do, watch for changes in their surroundings.
SD_14_03_sk_008	Can we have some of the orbs that work here on Florio?
SD_14_03_sk_009	Of course you can!
SD_14_03_sk_010	We’re gonna have to try these out back at the\nnature park!
CI_006_1A_00_001	Good, we’re all here.
CI_006_1A_00_002	Did you discover something?
CI_006_1A_00_003	That I did. I’ve found us a new teleportation point!
CI_006_1A_00_004	There’s a massive mountain in the heart of\nBelusylva Island.
CI_006_1A_00_005	I picked up a strong energy reading there, high up and\nhidden in the clouds.
CI_006_1A_00_006	In the clouds? Wait, we’re gonna teleport into the sky?!
CI_006_1A_00_007	Not quite. There seems to be a forest so high up\non the mountain that it’s above the clouds.
CI_006_1A_00_008	Too awesome!
CI_006_1A_00_009	Something about it feels mysterious. Even when viewed\nfrom the sky above, it’s hidden by fog.
CI_006_1A_00_010	That’s DOUBLE awesome! Let’s go already!
CI_006_1A_00_011	Hahaha! Take it easy, Phil.
CI_006_1A_00_012	When you’re ready, I’d like you to do some research\nup there. Discoveries await!
CI_006_3A_00_001	I heard there was another huge energy reading while\nyou were out doing research!
CI_006_3A_00_002	C’mon, Professor! Tell us what happened!
CI_006_3A_00_003	Yes, I was just about to.
CI_006_3A_00_004	There’s a tremendous amount of energy coming from\ndeep within the forest.
CI_006_3A_00_005	It’s got to be an {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]}.
CI_006_3A_00_006	And I’m almost certain it’s connected to the ruins you\nsaw nearby.
CI_006_3A_00_007	Can you go check it out as soon as you’re ready?
SD_15_02_sk_001	We’ve got new islands to explore now.
SD_15_02_sk_002	I’ve pinpointed two teleportation points we can use.
SD_15_02_sk_003	Ooh, where?
SD_15_02_sk_004	One on this {color[0000]}long, narrow island{color[ffff]}...and another offshore\nin the {color[0000]}middle of the water{color[ffff]}.
SD_15_02_sk_005	Captain Vince never got to that spot offshore, did he?
SD_15_02_sk_006	This is gonna be amazing!
SD_15_02_sk_007	I’ll let you decide what order you want to visit them in.\nKeep up the good work!
SD_16_01_sk_001	How’s it going? Enjoying your research jaunts?
SD_16_01_sk_002	Listen, I’ve got to tell you something. There’s a feature\nI originally forgot to suggest to the professor...
SD_16_01_sk_003	but I got him to add it to your research camera!
SD_16_01_sk_004	What kind of feature?
SD_16_01_sk_005	It’s a {color[0000]}melody player{color[ffff]}. It lets your camera play a little tune.
SD_16_01_sk_006	A little music can prompt Pokémon to show you whole\nnew sides of themselves.
SD_16_01_sk_007	Sounds awesome!
SD_16_01_sk_008	Rita, could you fill in the details?
SD_16_01_sk_009	Sure thing.
SD_16_01_sk_010	If you press {[0301|00cd]} , a melody will play.
SD_16_01_sk_011	While it’s playing, you can press {[0301|00cd]} again to make it stop.
SD_16_01_sk_012	A little music could wake up sleeping Pokémon...
SD_16_01_sk_013	or make some Pokémon get up and dance!
SD_16_01_sk_014	I haven’t had a chance to try it, though, so I’m no\nexpert...yet!
SD_16_01_sk_015	So next, let’s give it a whirl!
CI_003_2A_00_001	Your research on the beach is coming along well!
CI_003_2A_00_002	It seems like you’re about ready to move on to the\noffshore area.
CI_003_2A_00_003	The NEO-ONE can travel over a reef just as well as over\na river, after all.
CI_003_2A_00_004	Let’s get ready for some reef-search!
CI_004_1A_00_001	Hey, Professor! Everyone’s here!
CI_004_1A_00_002	Thanks, Rita. Let’s get started.
CI_004_1A_00_003	We’ve located a new teleportation point, but—
CI_004_1A_00_004	All right! Where is it? Where is it?!
CI_004_1A_00_005	That’s the thing. It’s {color[0000]}under the sea{color[ffff]}, of all places.
CI_004_1A_00_006	Are you serious? That’s so awesome!
CI_004_1A_00_007	There’s just one thing—the NEO-ONE wasn’t really built\nto go underwater...
CI_004_1A_00_008	Awww, come on!
CI_004_1A_00_009	...so I’ve fixed it up so it can!
CI_004_1A_00_010	Why didn’t you lead with that part?!
CI_004_1A_00_011	Oh my gosh! I can’t wait!
CI_004_1A_00_012	So get ready, everyone. We’ve got some seafloor\nresearch to do.
CI_004_1A_00_013	Under the sea, huh? This’ll be a sight to see.
CI_004_0A_00_001	I’ve finally developed {color[0000]}Illumina orbs{color[ffff]} that you can use in\nthe {color[0000]}Maricopia Islands{color[ffff]}.
CI_004_0A_00_002	It might be worth your while to take another trip to the\nbeach and the reef!
CI_004_3A_00_001	Did you pull off some special feat again?
CI_004_3A_00_002	The professor’s been frantically analyzing the data you\nsent back.
CI_004_3A_00_003	Professor? Did you figure anything out?
CI_004_3A_00_004	I may have. Do you remember those ruins on\nthe seafloor?
CI_004_3A_00_005	I’m certain now that they’re connected to the\n{color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]}.
CI_004_3A_00_006	And as if to prove it, we’ve picked up more of those\nenergy readings that we’ve been seeing.
CI_004_3A_00_007	They’re coming from the {color[0000]}ocean depths{color[ffff]} beyond the ruins.
CI_004_3A_00_008	Guess that means Captain Vince couldn’t have gotten\nthere a hundred years ago.
CI_004_3A_00_009	Good thing we’ve got the NEO-ONE!
CI_004_3A_00_010	Time to get to work!
CI_003_1B_00_001	Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?
CI_003_1B_00_002	Has the professor told you yet?
CI_003_1B_00_003	He gave us the green light to go do some nighttime\nresearch at the beach!
CI_003_1B_00_004	You must be psyched to go, too, right?
CI_003_1B_00_005	I can’t wait!
CI_003_2B_00_001	...
CI_003_2B_00_002	OK, so what’s the good news you were talking about?
CI_003_2B_00_003	Oooh, I bet you’re itching to know!
CI_003_2B_00_004	You’re the one who brought it up!
CI_003_2B_00_005	OK, fair point.
CI_003_2B_00_006	Anyway, I got the professor to let us go check out\n{color[0000]}the reef in the evening{color[ffff]}!
CI_003_2B_00_007	Whoa, nice!
CI_003_2B_00_008	Right?!
CI_003_2B_00_009	I can’t wait to see the sun set over the reef. It’s gonna\nbe breathtaking!
CI_003_2B_00_010	Yeah, that’ll make for some sweet photos!
CI_003_2B_00_011	I call first trip!
CI_003_2B_00_012	Hey, no fair!
CI_007_1B_00_001	Looks like you’ve gotten some great research done in\nthe desert!
CI_007_1B_00_002	I suppose it’s time to take the next step and have you go\nthere at night.
CI_007_1B_00_003	Once you photograph the {color[0000]}Illumina phenomenon{color[ffff]} in\naction, I can make Illumina orbs for that island!
CI_008_0A_00_001	Welcome back!
CI_008_0A_00_002	I’ve finished analyzing the Illumina phenomenon as it\noccurs on {color[0000]}Voluca Island{color[ffff]}.
CI_008_0A_00_003	So without further ado, here you go:
CI_008_0A_00_004	{color[0000]}Illumina orbs{color[ffff]} for {color[0000]}Voluca Island{color[ffff]}!
CI_008_0A_00_005	Use them to take your research even further!
CI_008_1A_00_001	All right, let the meeting begin. First—
CI_008_1A_00_002	Hey, Professor!
CI_008_1A_00_003	You figured out where we’re gonna go next, right?
CI_008_1A_00_004	That I did. Glad you’re as eager as ever, Phil.
CI_008_1A_00_005	C’mon! Tell us!
CI_008_1A_00_006	I’m getting there, I’m getting there.
CI_008_1A_00_007	Our next research site will be a {color[0000]}volcano{color[ffff]}.
CI_008_1A_00_008	All right! That’s intense!
CI_008_1A_00_009	Will we be OK?
CI_008_1A_00_010	Absolutely! I just finished reinforcing the NEO-ONE for\nextra safety.
CI_008_1A_00_011	Can Pokémon really live in a volcano?!
CI_008_1A_00_012	That’s what we need you to go find out!
CI_008_1A_00_013	Best of luck out there!
CI_008_3A_00_001	I can’t believe there were ruins that deep inside!
CI_008_3A_00_002	They must have been built by people, too, right?
CI_008_3A_00_003	Right you are. And most likely with some special\npurpose in mind.
CI_008_3A_00_004	As for that big hole we saw in the wall...
CI_008_3A_00_005	I picked up an {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]}’s energy coming\nfrom inside.
CI_008_3A_00_006	Where do you suppose the hole leads?
CI_008_3A_00_007	I wouldn’t be surprised if it were a tunnel all the way to\na far-off volcano...
CI_008_3A_00_008	You think there’s a Pokémon that uses that tunnel to\nget around?
CI_008_3A_00_009	What kind of Pokémon would do that?
CI_008_3A_00_010	We’ll have to see for ourselves. Good luck on this\nnext expedition!
SD_16B_01_sk_001	Now we know for sure that {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon {color[ffff]}live on this\nisland as well.
SD_16B_01_sk_002	That brings us back to the idea that the events depicted\nin Lental’s legends actually happened.
SD_16B_01_sk_003	Don’t the legends say Pokémon warded off some huge\ndisaster? What do you think it was?
SD_16B_01_sk_004	Evidence suggests it was a {color[0000]}meteorite{color[ffff]}.
SD_16B_01_sk_005	About 2,000 years ago, what we now know as the\n{color[0000]}Tellur Meteorite{color[ffff]} arrived.
SD_16B_01_sk_006	According to the legends of what happened then...
SD_16B_01_sk_007	the Illumina Pokémon’s power was scattered all over the\nregion, making the Pokémon of Lental glow.
SD_16B_01_sk_008	An interesting idea, isn’t it?
SD_16B_01_sk_009	But here’s my theory:
SD_16B_01_sk_010	What really caused the Pokémon of Lental to glow was,\nin fact, the Tellur Meteorite itself...
SD_16B_01_sk_011	and {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]} are the ones that were most\nheavily affected by the meteorite.
SD_16B_01_sk_012	So...the legends are wrong?
SD_16B_01_sk_013	That’s what we’re trying to find out—which is why our\nresearch is so important!
SD_16B_02_sk_001	Another island, another amazing Illumina Pokémon!
SD_16B_02_sk_002	That’s right—it’s just like the travelogue said.
SD_16B_02_sk_003	Every part of Lental is home to its own\nIllumina Pokémon.
SD_16B_02_sk_004	The question is, how could Captain Vince have found\nthat out?
SD_16B_02_sk_005	He only wrote about meeting two \nIllumina Pokémon, right?
SD_16B_02_sk_006	Yes—and yet he also wrote that there were {color[0000]}four{color[ffff]}.
SD_16B_02_sk_007	Hmmm...
SD_16B_02_sk_008	The mysteries just keep piling up.
SD_16B_02_sk_009	Indeed. That’s what makes this so intriguing!
SD_16B_03_sk_001	How come YOU’RE always the one who finds the\nIllumina Pokémon?!
SD_16B_03_sk_002	I’m sure you’ll have the pleasure before long, Phil.
SD_16B_03_sk_003	Anyway, by the look of things, the Tellur Meteorite\naffected a very wide area.
SD_16B_03_sk_004	Yeah, Professor—just like you thought! I wonder if the\nnearby Pokémon made it through OK.
SD_16B_03_sk_005	Judging by how far the effects spread, I would assume\nthe impact caused tremendous damage...
SD_16B_03_sk_006	but we haven’t found a shred of evidence to support\nthat assumption.
SD_16B_03_sk_007	Yeah, isn’t it weird?
SD_16B_03_sk_008	Do you think that Illumina Pokémon we saw just now was\nthe last one?
SD_16B_03_sk_009	Good question! I’ve actually just discovered something\nremarkable on that front.
SD_16B_03_sk_010	Let’s discuss it once we’re all back together.
SD_17_02_sk_001	What have we observed from the {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]}\nwe’ve encountered on these four islands?
SD_17_02_sk_002	That they’re all gorgeous, for one thing!
SD_17_02_sk_003	Every time we’ve come in contact with one, we’ve also\ndetected energy readings at different locations\nthroughout the region.
SD_17_02_sk_004	Could the Pokémon be communicating with each other?
SD_17_02_sk_005	That’s a possibility. But there’s more.
SD_17_02_sk_006	So far we’ve picked up five energy readings, and we’ve\nfinally pinpointed the {color[0000]}location of the fifth{color[ffff]}.
SD_17_02_sk_007	Does that mean we’re coming up on our last destination?
SD_17_02_sk_008	I suspect so, yes.
SD_17_02_sk_009	Take a look—here’s our next and final island!
SD_17_02_sk_010	That’s like a million miles away!
SD_17_02_sk_011	Wait a second—does that white mean {color[0000]}snow{color[ffff]}?
SD_17_02_sk_012	Yes—it seems the area is covered in it.
SD_17_02_sk_013	All right! Let me at it!
SD_17_02_sk_014	Get ready, everyone. It’s time to explore an island that\nCaptain Vince himself never reached!
SD_18_01_sk_001	I’ve got some news I think you’ll like!
SD_18_01_sk_002	Since we’ve got new areas to research, I’ve given the\nNEO-ONE a special upgrade.
SD_18_01_sk_003	Namely, a {color[0000]}turbo{color[ffff]} function! This will really get you moving!
SD_18_01_sk_004	Hee hee—yup! I got to take it for a spin just now!
SD_18_01_sk_005	Trust me, that thing can move.
SD_18_01_sk_006	Not only will you get where you’re going faster, but you’ll\nalso have more control over the timing of your photos.
SD_18_01_sk_007	As for the details... Take it away, Rita!
SD_18_01_sk_008	Yes, sir, Professor!
SD_18_01_sk_009	To use the turbo, just press .
SD_18_01_sk_010	The NEO-ONE will go faster as long as you hold\nthe button.
SD_18_01_sk_011	Oh, and speaking of changing your speed—
SD_18_01_sk_012	Did you know the NEO-ONE {color[0000]}slows down{color[ffff]} automatically\nwhen you look behind you or zoom in on something?
SD_18_01_sk_013	That’s because it reacts to how you move your camera!
SD_18_01_sk_014	Adding turbo to the mix should let you snap photos\nof Pokémon from lots of different angles!
SD_18_01_sk_015	Now let’s get to investigating the new island!
CI_009_1B_00_001	That snow was quite a sight!
CI_009_1B_00_002	It was a real treat to see since it never snows on Florio.
CI_009_1B_00_003	I’m looking forward to seeing it in the moonlight.
CI_009_1B_00_004	If you spot the {color[0000]}Illumina phenomenon{color[ffff]} in action, don’t let\nits brilliance distract you from taking photos of it!
CI_010_0A_00_001	Another round of Illumina phenomenon\nanalysis complete!
CI_010_0A_00_002	So here you are—{color[0000]}Illumina orbs for Durice Island{color[ffff]}.
CI_010_0A_00_003	Those ought to open some new doors in your research.
CI_010_0A_00_004	And with a little more progress, I think we’ll be able to\nlocate the final Illumina Pokémon.
CI_010_0A_00_005	You’re doing wonderfully. Keep it up!
CI_010_1A_00_001	Professor! Professor! I heard we found a new\nteleportation point!
CI_010_1A_00_002	Word reaches you quickly, Rita.\nThat’s a good quality for an assistant!
CI_010_1A_00_003	Yes, we’ve pinpointed another reading. It’s coming from\n{color[0000]}underground{color[ffff]}, farther into {color[0000]}Durice Island{color[ffff]}.
CI_010_1A_00_004	Whoa, we’re going underground? This is gonna\nbe awesome!
CI_010_1A_00_005	The {color[0000]}cave {color[ffff]}we’ll be exploring looks quite deep.
CI_010_1A_00_006	I’m counting on you to leave no stone unturned\ndown there!
CI_010_3A_00_001	Just imagine—plants thriving so deep underground!
CI_010_3A_00_002	What wonders the world hides...
CI_010_3A_00_003	Hey, Professor! What was the important thing you\nwanted to tell us?
CI_010_3A_00_004	Ah, yes. Good news!
CI_010_3A_00_005	We’ve located an {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon on Durice Island{color[ffff]}!
CI_010_3A_00_006	That’s right. We’ve picked up that familiar reading\ncoming from a {color[0000]}large empty space{color[ffff]} deeper in the cave.
CI_010_3A_00_007	Which means we’ve found our last {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]}!
CI_010_3A_00_008	You know what to do, trusty photographer!
SD_19_02_sk_001	That mural has turned my whole theory on its head!
SD_19_02_sk_002	Not only is there another Illumina Pokémon, but\nthey’ve also been around since before the meteorite...
SD_19_02_sk_003	Is it just me, Professor, or is that excitement in\nyour voice?
SD_19_02_sk_004	It’s not just you! This wasn’t what I expected, but it’s a\nfascinating discovery.
SD_19_02_sk_005	Plus, I’ve gone over all our data, and it shows that\nenergy from all over Lental is converging in one spot.
SD_19_02_sk_006	And in that same spot, we picked up a very faint reading\nfrom an {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]}.
SD_19_02_sk_007	The central one from the mural?!
SD_19_02_sk_008	It seems like it.
SD_19_02_sk_009	So where is it?!
SD_19_02_sk_010	That’s the tricky part.
SD_19_02_sk_011	This points to a tiny island that doesn’t even appear on\nthe map.
SD_19_02_sk_012	And there, most likely, is where we’ll find the island\nspoken of in the legends—{color[0000]}Aurus Island{color[ffff]}.
SD_19_02_sk_013	Time for one final expedition! Let’s find the truth once\nand for all!
CI_011_0A_00_001	Another set of amazing ruins!
CI_011_0A_00_002	That’s right. And here’s something intriguing about them:
CI_011_0A_00_003	They seem to include two distinct types of structures.
CI_011_0A_00_004	What’s different about them?
CI_011_0A_00_005	If we compare the ruins at the entrance to what we saw\ndeeper inside the cave...
CI_011_0A_00_006	the cave part seems to have been built later—and\npossibly in a hurry.
CI_011_0A_00_007	There was definitely something weird about that area.\nWhy were flowers from the other islands in there?
CI_011_0A_00_008	We can take that as evidence that energy from all\nthroughout Lental is converging there.
CI_011_0A_00_009	If we can untangle these mysteries, I’m sure we’ll find\nthe way forward!
CI_011_0A_00_010	In the meantime, I’ve finished work on another set of\n{color[0000]}Illumina orbs{color[ffff]}. I’m sure they’ll prove to be helpful.
CI_011_0A_00_011	We’re getting close to our goal, thanks to all the research\nyou three have been doing. Keep it up!
CI_011_3A_00_001	Looks like now’s the moment we’ve been waiting for.
CI_011_3A_00_002	If I’m reading the topography correctly...
CI_011_3A_00_003	this ought to take you straight to the {color[0000]}center of the ruins{color[ffff]},\nthrough the gate we saw at the beginning.
CI_011_3A_00_004	That’s where we’ll find the Pokémon that was in the\nmiddle of the others in the {color[0000]}mural{color[ffff]}, right?
CI_011_3A_00_005	Right! After all this, we may finally get to meet it.
CI_011_3A_00_006	And I think we all know you’re the one to handle\nthat moment!
CI_011_3A_00_007	Yeah, yeah. Of course you get all the fun. You better get\nsome good photos!
CI_011_3A_00_008	Say hi to the Illumina Pokémon for me!
CI_011_3A_00_009	I can see in your eyes that you’re ready. That’s the spirit!
CI_011_3A_00_010	Good luck out there! Keep your chin up and your\ncamera ready!
SD_20_01_sk_001	I knew it! We were right to believe there was\n{color[0000]}another Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]}!
SD_20_01_sk_002	The mural was spot on!
SD_20_01_sk_003	Yes—which raises the question...
SD_20_01_sk_004	Did things really happen the way the mural\ndepicts them?
SD_20_01_sk_023	Maybe Xerneas called out to all the others for help...
SD_20_01_sk_005	so they could make a {color[0000]}barrier {color[ffff]}or something to stop\nthe meteorite?
SD_20_01_sk_006	A barrier big enough to cover the whole Lental region?!
SD_20_01_sk_007	Hmm. I don’t know.
SD_20_01_sk_008	That’s gotta be what happened!
SD_20_01_sk_009	That’d mean the people who built the ruins long ago\nhelped the Illumina Pokémon, too!
SD_20_01_sk_010	But the meteorite came 2,000 years ago! Shouldn’t\nXerneas have awakened long before now?
SD_20_01_sk_011	I think stopping the meteorite probably took just about\neverything it had.
SD_20_01_sk_012	So much so that it’s still tired after a 2,000-year nap.
SD_20_01_sk_013	Hmmm.
SD_20_01_sk_014	When do you think that mural was made, anyway?
SD_20_01_sk_015	Wait, what?
SD_20_01_sk_016	And who do you think made it?
SD_20_01_sk_017	I—well...
SD_20_01_sk_018	...
SD_20_01_sk_019	...
SD_20_01_sk_020	... ... ...
SD_20_01_sk_021	Wait!
SD_20_01_sk_022	Why is it you were able to meet those Illumina Pokémon?
SD_21_01_sk_001	This has been one eventful survey, huh?
SD_21_01_sk_002	It sure has—one that took us to every corner of Lental.
SD_21_01_sk_003	None of it would have happened without the three of you.\nI can’t thank you enough for all your hard work.
SD_21_01_sk_004	We’ve found even more topics begging to be studied.
SD_21_01_sk_005	Well, I’m sticking around to help!
SD_21_01_sk_006	I was hoping you would.
SD_21_01_sk_008	And I’m sure your research is just getting started!
SD_21_01_sk_009	Speaking of which, weren’t you going to explain your new\nidea, Professor?
SD_21_01_sk_010	Oh, yes, I was! Let me tell you about {color[0000]}course scores{color[ffff]}.
SD_21_01_sk_011	They’re a system I’ve devised to measure how\nthoroughly you can research a course in a single outing.
SD_21_01_sk_012	Quality counts here, but so does quantity. Try to\nphotograph as many Pokémon as you can.
SD_21_01_sk_013	If you use the online Internet feature, you can\nsee your {color[0000]}ranking{color[ffff]} for your course scores, too.
SD_21_01_sk_014	And wasn’t there one more piece of good news?
SD_21_01_sk_015	Ah, you must mean {color[0000]}Burst Mode{color[ffff]}!
SD_21_01_sk_016	That’s a new feature I had the professor add to your\nresearch cameras.
SD_21_01_sk_017	If you turn it on, your camera will take {color[0000]}multiple photos{color[ffff]} in\nquick succession with {color[0000]}one press of the shutter{color[ffff]}!
SD_21_01_sk_018	You can turn it on and off from the {color[0000]}Settings menu{color[ffff]}.\nGive it a shot—it should come in handy!
SD_21_01_sk_019	Man, Professor, you’re almost as cool as my mentor.\nWait one sec. I’m going out on an expedition!
SD_21_01_sk_020	Hahaha!
SD_21_01_sk_007	Now go on and get back to building your personal\n{color[0000]}Photodex{color[ffff]}! Enjoy!
CI_101_0A_00_001	Hey, how are things? Research going OK?
CI_101_0A_00_002	Listen, I know you can take the NEO-ONE off to other\nislands, but why not try snapping some photos here?
CI_101_0A_00_003	You may already be familiar with the Pokémon around\nhere, but I bet you’ll find new sides to them if you look.
CI_101_0A_00_004	Just choose this {color[0000]}icon at the top left{color[ffff]} of the research camp\nmenu to get started.
CI_101_0A_00_005	Give it a try when the mood strikes you. No pressure.
CI_101_0A_01_001	Hey there, shutterbugs!
CI_101_0A_01_002	Remember how I suggested you try doing a little\nphotography here at camp?
CI_101_0A_01_003	Yeah, thanks for the tip! It was cool seeing the camp\nthrough fresh eyes.
CI_101_0A_01_004	In that case, here’s another idea: Why not try starting\nfrom a different spot?
CI_101_0A_01_005	That ought to give you another new perspective.
CI_101_0A_01_006	A different spot? Like where?
CI_101_0A_01_007	How about right here? That’s different enough, isn’t it?
CI_101_0A_01_008	You can take a different route around the camp\ndepending on whether you start here or by the lab.
CI_101_0A_01_009	Oooh, I’ll have to give it a try later, then!
CI_101_0A_01_010	Sounds good. Just choose the {color[0000]}icon in the upper left{color[ffff]} of\nthe research camp menu to start.
CI_101_0A_01_011	Being more deeply attuned to everything happening right\naround you will make you a better photographer.
CI_101_0A_01_012	Anyway, have fun and take all the photos you like!

NH_Chat_001	Heading out to take some photos? I look forward\nto seeing what kind of shots you get!
NH_Chat_002	Hello there. Here to check out\nsome research data? Go ahead!
NH_Chat_003	How are you doing? If you want to see your\nphotos, you can visit the lab anytime.
NH_Chat_004	Hmm... So when it comes to that phenomenon—\nOh, didn’t see you there. Need help with anything?
NH_Chat_005	... ... ...Whoa! Sorry about that! I was so deep\nin thought, I didn’t even notice you!
NH_Chat_006	Are you off to do some research?\nI can’t wait to see your photos!
NH_Chat_007	Mmm, it’s gorgeous today! If I were a Starly,\nI’d be flying around happily, too!
NH_Chat_008	Why don’t we take a bunch of photos\nand surprise the professor with them?
NH_Chat_009	Waaah! The professor’s walking around lost in\nthought again! He’s gotta look where he’s going!
NH_Chat_010	Oh, hey! Want anything to drink? I was just about\nto put some coffee on for the professor.
NH_Chat_011	Going out on another expedition?\nGood luck out there!
NH_Chat_012	Hi! Back to look at some of your photos, are you?\nIt’s always a good idea to review your work!
NH_Chat_013	Your photos bring one discovery after another!\nI could just study them all day!
NH_Chat_014	Hmm...so the patterns on Illumina Pokémon can—\nOh, hello! Did you have a question?
NH_Chat_015	... ... ...Oh! Sorry about that.\nI was working on something.
NH_Chat_016	Going out to take more photos?\nI hope you get some cute shots!
NH_Chat_017	I spent so much energy playing\nwith Stoutland, now I’m hungry!
NH_Chat_018	Your pictures are amazing!\nI gotta work harder!
NH_Chat_019	It’s great that the professor is so into his research,\nbut he should make sure he actually sleeps at night!
NH_Chat_020	Oh, hey—good timing!\nCome look over this data with me!
NH_Chat_021	Going out on an expedition?\nI just got back from mine!
NH_Chat_022	You’re not gonna go out for research? \nDon’t complain if I get the best shots before you!
NH_Chat_023	Hey, I saw your Photodex. It’s looking pretty good! \nWell...of course, mine is even better!
NH_Chat_024	Cameras are the coolest! One click,\nand you’ve got that moment forever!
NH_Chat_025	Hold up—where’d my mentor go?
NH_Chat_026	Hey there! Expedition time?\nMake sure you’re mentally prepared!
NH_Chat_027	When you’re behind the camera, it’s easy to tune everything out.\nBut observing your surroundings carefully is key!
NH_Chat_028	Photographing wild Pokémon well takes patience. The mark\nof a pro is when you don’t just put in the time—you enjoy it, too!
NH_Chat_029	Whoa! Ahh, it went and hid...\nDid you see that Dedenne just now?!
NH_Chat_030	Look, it’s that Starly that always hangs out around here.\nAfter watching it for so long, I can tell it apart from others!
NH_Chat_031	I’ve always wanted to see an Illumina Pokémon. As a child, I’d run\naround looking for them with the Lental Travelogue as my guide!
NH_Chat_032	Ever since you got here, we’ve made significant\nprogress on our research. Thanks for your help!
NH_Chat_033	At your age, I had my nose in the\nLental Travelogue day and night.
NH_Chat_034	I just finished up some maintenance on the NEO-ONE! \nYou can take it out for research anytime!
NH_Chat_035	So if the Illumina Pokémon saved Lental from the meteorite, then what about—\nOh, hello. Sorry, just puzzling over something.
NH_Chat_036	Hey, let’s go do some research! The Pokémon\nalways look happy when you’re around!
NH_Chat_037	The professor’s been in a good mood lately! \nMust be all those new photos you’re bringing him!
NH_Chat_038	I saw Meowth playing in the NEO-ONE earlier!
NH_Chat_039	How’s your Photodex coming along?\nLet’s go look at it together!
NH_Chat_040	Earlier, Phil was saying you’re really cool!\nDon’t tell him I told you, though!
NH_Chat_041	What kind of photo should I go for next?\nOh, I know! I wanna get a really cool shot of Tyranitar!
NH_Chat_042	Todd said I should look back over my photos.\nSo I did, and now I wanna go take more!
NH_Chat_043	The other day, this Cutiefly was hovering right above my head, and\nit wouldn’t buzz off even when I started running! That was a shock!
NH_Chat_044	How come Pokémon always look\nso happy in your photos?
NH_Chat_045	Hey, how come your photos turn out\nso good? C’mon, gimme just one hint!
NH_Chat_046	Watching you takes me back to when I was a beginner.\nI gotta recapture that drive to improve!
NH_Chat_047	I’ve taken photos all over the world, but still,\nI’ve gotta admit...Lental’s a fascinating place!
NH_Chat_048	Of course I’ll help you...’cause I’m a genius photographer!\nHeh heh. Just saying that gives me a little burst of confidence.
NH_Chat_049	Oooh, the perfect moment! ...Got it.\nIt really is great to see Pokémon in their natural state.
NH_Chat_050	Oooh, perfect chance! ...Nice. Got it.\nIt’s pretty fun taking photos even here at the research camp, isn’t it?
NH_Chat_051	I was born and raised here on Florio, but the more we research,\nthe more I see how much I’ve still got to learn about the island!
NH_Chat_052	Once the professor gets curious about something,\nyou can’t even pry him from the lab!
NH_Chat_053	I barely get half the stuff the professor\ntalks about. Do you?
NH_Chat_054	Mirror’s such an avid researcher, people were calling him “professor” before\nhe even became one. Sometimes I almost forget his real name!
NH_Chat_055	Rita’s a really good kid. She’s been\na huge help here at the lab.
NH_Chat_056	I love Pokémon so much!\nI wish I could just stay here forever.
NH_Chat_057	Rita’s always acting like she’s our big sister or something.\nShe’s not even that much older than us!
NH_Chat_058	Rita’s the professor’s assistant, right? He can be pretty\nabsent-minded, so I’m sure she’s a big help.
NH_Chat_059	Phil’s a real dynamo. Sometimes he gets\nphotos that nobody else could!
NH_Chat_060	I swear, Phil never settles down! Just when you\nthink you know where he is, poof—he’s gone!
NH_Chat_061	I’ve got the coolest mentor! His photos are amazing!\nTodd, where are you?! Teach me to be like youuu!
NH_Chat_062	I never invited Phil to be my pupil—he just declared himself my “number one\nstudent” and started tagging along! But honestly...I was kind of flattered.
NH_Chat_063	Todd’s calmed down since I last saw him. Or maybe\nhe’s just acting mature because you kids are around...
NH_Chat_064	Todd’s impressive! I once saw him\nfeatured in a magazine!
NH_Chat_065	My mentor’s the coolest! I gotta show\nyou his photo books sometime.
NH_Chat_066	You know, I was just about your age when I was invited\nto a certain island to do some research photography.
NH_Chat_067	How wonderful that we found an Illumina Pokémon!\nAnd we won’t stop there—our research is just getting started!
NH_Chat_068	The professor is also researching ways the Illumina phenomenon\ncould be useful for the people living on Florio Island!
NH_Chat_069	Y’know how Rita gushes about how awesome\nthe professor is? I definitely get why now.
NH_Chat_070	The professor used to be kinda reckless back in the day.\nI suppose after 10 years, he must’ve calmed down a bit.
NH_Chat_071	Rita has always really loved Pokémon. Mention Goodra\naround her, and she can keep talking about it forever!
NH_Chat_072	I love how even with all their differences, Pokémon\nseem to really communicate heart to heart!
NH_Chat_073	Rita sure likes taking care of people. It kinda feels like\nshe treats me the same as she treats Pokémon...
NH_Chat_074	Rita sure is a nice kid. She must feel kinda\nlike an older sister to you and Phil.
NH_Chat_075	I can tell from Phil’s photos that he’s been studying.\nThey keep getting better and better.
NH_Chat_076	The other day, I saw Phil looking over his photos\nand muttering, “How can I take better shots?!”
NH_Chat_077	I wanna travel all over taking cool\nphotos, just like my mentor!
NH_Chat_078	Phil’s been talking about your photos a lot lately.\nI’m glad he’s found himself such a good rival.
NH_Chat_079	I first met Todd on a research trip. Hard to believe\nit’s been almost a decade since then!
NH_Chat_080	Todd showed me an amazing old photo! It was shiny\nand sparkling with all the colors of the rainbow!
NH_Chat_081	I’m gonna be an even better photographer than my mentor!\nBetter watch out, or I’ll zip right past ya!
NH_Chat_082	Wow, watching you kids makes me want\nto set off on another photography trip!
NH_Tips_001	Lental has all sorts of islands.\nRight now, we’re on {color[0000]}Florio Island{color[ffff]}.
NH_Tips_002	This is {color[0000]}Florio Island{color[ffff]}!\nLet’s get some research done!
NH_Tips_003	Getting to other islands should be a snap now.\nFeel free to go out and research them!
NH_Tips_004	The professor says that since the islands have different\nenvironments, you can find different Pokémon on ’em!
NH_Tips_005	This island’s the one with the woods... What about this one?\nGuess we’ll find out when we get there!
NH_Tips_006	I bet the different environments on each island\nwill make for some pretty distinctive photos!
NH_Tips_007	Look—you can clearly see the islands’\ndifferent climates this way.
NH_Tips_008	Hmm... I can’t decide which island’s\nPokémon I want to see next!
NH_Tips_009	Which island are you gonna go see?\nI’m off to...think about it some more!
NH_Tips_010	It’s unusual to see such different climates\non islands so close together.
NH_Tips_011	Here on {color[0000]}Florio Island{color[ffff]}, people work to protect\nnature and live together with Pokémon.
NH_Tips_012	The temperature on {color[0000]}Florio Island{color[ffff]} stays the same all year long.\nI wonder what it’s like in places that get super hot or super cold.
NH_Tips_013	This here is {color[0000]}Belusylva Island{color[ffff]}, which is humid all year long. \nIt’s mostly covered by a forest, as I’m sure you’ve noticed.
NH_Tips_014	Oh yeah, this is that island with all the trees. Tough to get\ngood shots when leaves are always in the way.
NH_Tips_015	This here is {color[0000]}Voluca Island{color[ffff]}.\nIt’s hot, and most everywhere on it is arid.
NH_Tips_016	I’m curious to know how Pokémon live\nin such a harsh environment.
NH_Tips_017	There is very little land among the {color[0000]}Maricopia Islands{color[ffff]}.\nWe’ll mainly be conducting marine research there.
NH_Tips_018	I can’t wait to see some Pokémon that live in the ocean!\nI hope we can get some pretty shots with the water sparkling.
NH_Tips_019	All these white areas on {color[0000]}Durice Island{color[ffff]} are snow.\nIt’s an island of pure winter!
NH_Tips_020	Looks cold enough to freeze your fingers stiff...\nGood thing the NEO-ONE’s nice and toasty!
NH_Tips_021	{color[0000]}Aurus Island{color[ffff]} is full of mysteries.\nIt consists almost entirely of enormous, ancient ruins.
NH_Tips_022	Pokémon charged with guarding ancient ruins?\nTalk about a subject I’d love to photograph...
NH_Tips_023	{color[0000]}Florio Nature Park{color[ffff]} is open to the public, so most of the\nPokémon there are used to being around people.
NH_Tips_024	Whenever I think of the {color[0000]}nature park{color[ffff]}, the first thing that\nsprings to mind is Bidoof! I love how laid-back they are.
NH_Tips_027	You’ll be working amid very thick greenery in {color[0000]}Founja Jungle{color[ffff]}.\nDo your best to get clear shots of Pokémon!
NH_Tips_028	Sometimes, if you look carefully at the trees...ta-da! \nA Pokémon will show itself! It’s always fun when that happens!
NH_Tips_031	In {color[0000]}Elsewhere Forest{color[ffff]}, it seems like you’re always just a step away from getting\nturned around and completely off track...
NH_Tips_032	I haven’t explored this course much...\nIt’s not ’cause I’m scared, though!
NH_Tips_033	It’s remarkable that Pokémon can live in harsh\nenvironments like the {color[0000]}Sweltering Sands{color[ffff]}!
NH_Tips_034	It’s hot in the {color[0000]}desert{color[ffff]}, so be careful! Well, if you’re\nin the NEO-ONE, I guess you should be fine.
NH_Tips_037	The environment around {color[0000]}Fireflow Volcano{color[ffff]} has remained\nvirtually unchanged since the prehistoric era.
NH_Tips_038	There’s a whole bunch of volcanoes here\nof all different sizes all stuck together!
NH_Tips_039	{color[0000]}Blushing Beach{color[ffff]} is so nice and warm,\nand the sea breeze feels great.
NH_Tips_040	I love how the sand here has just a touch of pink!\nIf only we could jump out of the NEO-ONE and walk on it!
NH_Tips_041	Some of the Pokémon in {color[0000]}Maricopia Reef{color[ffff]} might see\nthe NEO-ONE as a friend and swim by your side!
NH_Tips_042	Nothing says “{color[0000]}ocean{color[ffff]}” to me like a Wailord! Its sheer presence\nmakes an impact you won’t find anywhere else.
NH_Tips_043	We can observe some rare aquatic\nPokémon on the {color[0000]}Lental Seafloor{color[ffff]}.
NH_Tips_044	Nobody could get here just by swimming!\nI bet we’ll get some awesome photos!
NH_Tips_045	Ah, the {color[0000]}Shiver Snowfields{color[ffff]}... I wonder what\nCaptain Vince would have written about this place.
NH_Tips_046	It’s white as far as we can see!\nI wanna play with Pokémon in the snow!
NH_Tips_047	You can make it easier to find Pokémon in dark\nplaces like {color[0000]}Outaway Cave {color[ffff]}by running a scan!
NH_Tips_048	This place is dark and maybe a tiny bit scary...but the\nPokémon seem to be having a great time anyway!
NH_Tips_049	The {color[0000]}Ruins of Remembrance{color[ffff]} are the largest and most intact of\nall the ruins we’ve found. Let’s take our time looking around.
NH_Tips_050	There’s a lot of weird Pokémon hanging\naround there! Golurk is so cool...
NH_Tips_051	The glowing effect we call the {color[0000]}Illumina phenomenon{color[ffff]}\nhas only been observed here in Lental.
NH_Tips_052	The light from the{color[0000]} Illumina phenomenon{color[ffff]} is so gentle and pretty!\nAnd it seems to make Pokémon perk up, too.
NH_Tips_053	The most distinctive feature of {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]} is probably their glowing\npatterns...but I was surprised by just how big they are, too!
NH_Tips_054	I wanna see an {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]} up close, too!\nThey’re gigantic, they glow... What’s cooler than that?
NH_Tips_055	{color[0000]}Crystablooms{color[ffff]} are strange flowers that\ncan produce the Illumina phenomenon.
NH_Tips_056	So those glowing flowers are called {color[0000]}crystablooms{color[ffff]}, huh?\nIt’s pretty interesting to see how Pokémon react to them.
NH_Tips_057	The {color[0000]}Tellur Meteorite{color[ffff]} is believed to have impacted\nLental about 2,000 years ago.
NH_Tips_058	Some kinda meteorite fell from the sky? Wild!
NH_Tips_059	I invented the {color[0000]}NEO-ONE{color[ffff]}! It’s a fantastic machine\nand essential for Pokémon research!
NH_Tips_060	The {color[0000]}NEO-ONE{color[ffff]} uses the same technology\nas the pod I once used for my research.
NH_Tips_061	Captain Vince’s {color[0000]}Lental Travelogue{color[ffff]} is a really famous book.\nEvery house on Florio Island has a copy!
NH_Tips_062	I never thought we’d get to go on an adventure\nlike the one in the {color[0000]}Lental Travelogue{color[ffff]}!
NH_Tips_063	{color[0000]}Captain Vince{color[ffff]} explored the Lental region\none hundred years ago. He’s my hero.
NH_Tips_064	{color[0000]}Captain Vince{color[ffff]}, huh? His adventures remind me of my own\nphotography trips. I bet we would’ve had a lot of stories to swap.
NH_Tips_065	The Pokémon that your pointer is on will be your photo’s subject,\nso make sure it’s {color[0000]}centered in your frame{color[ffff]}! Remember that!
NH_Tips_066	You gotta use the {color[0000]}zoom {color[ffff]}function to get close-up shots of Pokémon!\nThe trick is to aim first, then zoom in so they look nice and big.
NH_Tips_067	If you run a {color[0000]}scan{color[ffff]}, you can sometimes\nfind Pokémon that are hiding!
NH_Tips_068	After a {color[0000]}scan{color[ffff]}, investigate    to {color[0000]}analyze {color[ffff]}what you’ve found. You might\nget a hint that’ll help you discover something new about a Pokémon!
NH_Tips_069	Some Pokémon are sensitive to the\nsound and signal of the {color[0000]}scan {color[ffff]}function.
NH_Tips_070	Want to lead a Pokémon somewhere? Try tossing some {color[0000]}fluffruit{color[ffff]}\ntoward it. If the Pokémon is hungry, it might go for it!
NH_Tips_071	If you toss an {color[0000]}Illumina orb{color[ffff]} at a Pokémon or crystabloom,\nit will light up with the Illumina phenomenon.
NH_Tips_072	Have you been using the {color[0000]}melody {color[ffff]}function?\nIt might be good to try it near sleeping Pokémon.
NH_Tips_073	If you play a {color[0000]}melody {color[ffff]}for a Pokémon that likes\nmusic, it might sing or dance for you.
NH_Tips_074	Using the {color[0000]}turbo {color[ffff]}function to go faster isn’t the only way to get shots from\ndifferent angles! You can also {color[0000]}zoom in {color[ffff]}or turn around to slow down.
NH_Tips_075	If you want the best {color[0000]}course scores{color[ffff]}, you’ll need\nto take lots of great photos on each course!
NH_Tips_076	You can go over all our research data in the {color[0000]}lab{color[ffff]}. Or as\nthe professor would say, “Reviewing your work is key!”
NH_Tips_077	Your {color[0000]}Photodex {color[ffff]}is where you can see the photos\nyou’ve taken. Reviewing your work is key!
NH_Tips_079	You can check the {color[0000]}map {color[ffff]}in your {color[0000]}Photodex {color[ffff]}to see\nwhere you’ve spotted Pokémon on each course.
NH_Tips_080	If you find a glowing {color[0000]}crystabloom{color[ffff]}, try to snap a photo of it.\nI’ll add it to the {color[0000]}Objects of Interest{color[ffff]} section of your {color[0000]}Photodex{color[ffff]}.
NH_Tips_081	If you find any {color[0000]}ancient ruins{color[ffff]}, try to snap a photo of them.\nI’ll add it to the {color[0000]}Objects of Interest{color[ffff]} section of your {color[0000]}Photodex{color[ffff]}.
NH_Tips_082	You can {color[0000]}customize {color[ffff]}your {color[0000]}album {color[ffff]}photos in all kinds of ways.\nThen it’s even more fun to share ’em with your friends!
NH_Tips_083	The NEO-ONE keeps a log of what you do out in the field.\nYou can see your records in your {color[0000]}research log{color[ffff]} in {color[0000]}Your Space{color[ffff]}.
NH_Tips_084	You can earn {color[0000]}titles {color[ffff]}by reaching research milestones.\nCheck {color[0000]}Your Space {color[ffff]}to see what you’ve earned so far.
NH_Tips_085	You can see pictures from players all over\nthe world in the online {color[0000]}Internet{color[ffff]} area.
NH_Tips_086	In the online {color[0000]}Internet{color[ffff]} menu, you can view {color[0000]}rankings {color[ffff]}for photo scores.\nYou can also see high-scoring shots that others have uploaded.
NH_Tips_087	If you’re in the online {color[0000]}Internet{color[ffff]} menu and see a photo you like, give it\n{color[0000]}Sweet! medals{color[ffff]}. I’m sure the photographer would be really happy to get them!
NH_Tips_088	In order to learn all aspects of Pokémon behavior,\nwe need to get {color[0000]}1★ to 4★{color[ffff]} photos of them all!
NH_Tips_089	Your {color[0000]}research level{color[ffff]} shows your progress on each course.\nSome courses even have separate levels for {color[0000]}day {color[ffff]}and {color[0000]}night{color[ffff]}.
NH_Tips_090	The same Pokémon might {color[0000]}behave differently depending on the time of day{color[ffff]}.\nMake sure you snap photos of Pokémon during the {color[0000]}day {color[ffff]}and at {color[0000]}night{color[ffff]}.
NH_Tips_091	After each expedition, you can save photos to your personal {color[0000]}album{color[ffff]}.\nYou can make last-minute changes with the {color[0000]}re-snap{color[ffff]} function, too!
NH_Sugg_001	Looks like there may be a spot or two around\nhere that you haven’t researched yet.
NH_Sugg_002	Judging by the map, I’m guessing there are still other routes\nyou can explore. Why don’t you research a little bit more?
NH_Sugg_003	Hey! There might be more to see\nif you keep your eyes peeled!
NH_Sugg_004	Looks like there may be a spot or two around\nhere that you haven’t researched yet.

NH_Sugg_007	I think there may be some Pokémon around\nhere that we haven’t researched yet.
NH_Sugg_008	I think there may still be some Pokémon around\nhere that you haven’t photographed yet.
NH_Sugg_009	When I was watching the monitor earlier, I think I caught a\nglimpse of a Pokémon you don’t have in your Photodex yet.
NH_Sugg_010	Lots of Pokémon come to visit the {color[0000]}research camp{color[ffff]}.\nYou can even see some of them right inside the {color[0000]}lab{color[ffff]}.
NH_Sugg_011	Have you taken many photos here at {color[0000]}camp{color[ffff]}? Do you think\nthere may be some spots you haven’t checked yet?
NH_Sugg_012	This place sure is buzzing!\nThere are even Pokémon inside the {color[0000]}lab{color[ffff]}!
NH_Sugg_013	Come to think of it, I think there’s a Pokémon\nhere at {color[0000]}camp {color[ffff]}that isn’t in your {color[0000]}Photodex {color[ffff]}yet.
NH_Sugg_014	A while ago, I saw a Pokémon here at {color[0000]}camp {color[ffff]}that\nI don’t think you’ve gotten on camera yet.

NH_Sugg_019	At {color[0000]}night{color[ffff]}, you might be able to see the Illumina phenomenon\nat the {color[0000]}nature park{color[ffff]}.  Observe your surroundings carefully.
NH_Sugg_020	Let’s go to the {color[0000]}Illumina spot{color[ffff]} in the {color[0000]}nature park{color[ffff]}!\nWe might find an {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]} there!
NH_Sugg_021	I’d like to see that glowing pattern on the {color[0000]}Illumina Pokémon{color[ffff]}...\nPlease investigate the {color[0000]}Illumina spot {color[ffff]}at the {color[0000]}nature park{color[ffff]}!
NH_Sugg_022	{color[0000]}Fluffruit {color[ffff]}and {color[0000]}scans {color[ffff]}can help you set up all kinds of photos.\nDon’t be shy about using ’em!
NH_Sugg_023	I need a bit more time to prepare. In the meantime, why not see what\nPokémon you can find at the{color[0000]} nature park{color[ffff]} using {color[0000]}fluffruit {color[ffff]}and {color[0000]}scans{color[ffff]}?
NH_Sugg_024	Research on {color[0000]}Belusylva Island{color[ffff]} awaits!\n{color[0000]}Scans {color[ffff]}should come in handy in that dense {color[0000]}jungle{color[ffff]}!
NH_Sugg_025	Could you get a photo of a {color[0000]}crystabloom{color[ffff]}\nglowing in the {color[0000]}jungle{color[ffff]} at {color[0000]}night{color[ffff]}?
NH_Sugg_026	Yeah! We’re gonna go research a bunch of spots!\nLet’s see who can take better photos!

Mis_Stage001_061_01_Head	Livening Up the Flowers

Mis_Stage001_081_01_Head	Off to a Flying Startle
Mis_Stage001_081_01_Info1	I tried to get a photo of Taillow\nmidflight, but I guess I must’ve\nstartled them! I wish I could’ve\ngotten a nicer shot...

Mis_Stage001_097_01_Head	Head-to-Head Competition

Mis_Stage001_112_01_Head	One-Hand Freeze
Mis_Stage001_112_01_Info1	Watch Grookey in the nature\npark carefully. Every now and\nthen, it does something that I\nthink you’ll get a kick out of.

Mis_Stage003_063_01_Head	An Easy Mistake to Make
Mis_Stage003_063_01_Info1	I hear that in one region, there’s\na misunderstanding between\nExeggutor and Crabrawler. Is\nthat also true here in Lental?

Mis_Stage003_071_01_Head	Most Marvelous Muscles

Mis_Stage003_080_01_Head	A Casual Gesture

Mis_Stage003_098_01_Head	Inkay by Moonlight

Mis_Stage004_088_01_Head	Swimming Clamperl

Mis_Stage004_088_01_Info2	Oh! Great job spotting that!\nI guess they only swim when it’s\nabsolutely necessary. Do you\nthink it managed to get away?
Mis_Stage004_111_00_01_Head	Swirling Energy
Mis_Stage004_111_00_01_Info1	This area is infused with a lot of\nIllumina energy. You might see\nWishiwashi behaving different\nthan usual.

Mis_Stage004_193_01_Info2	Whoa, seriously?! I can’t believe\nyou got that shot! Must’ve been\ntough for you to catch Qwilfish\nbefore it sped away!
Mis_Stage004_196_01_Head	Seafloor Roar
Mis_Stage004_196_01_Info1	This photo of Phil’s definitely\nmakes a strong impression, but\nI think the timing could be better.

Mis_Stage004_209_01_Head	A New Way to Dance

Mis_Stage004_251_01_Head	Ready, Aim, Fire!
Mis_Stage004_251_01_Info1	Aren’t Clawitzer the coolest\nwhen they’re havin’ a shootout?!\nThey fire these awesome water\ncannonballs, but they’re really\nhard to get on camera.
Mis_Stage004_251_01_Info2	You’re kidding me! You actually\ngot that shot?! How’d you do it?\nC’mon, tell me!
Mis_Stage004_258_01_Head	Golisopod Training

Mis_Stage006_263_01_Info1	This Sawsbuck seemed to be\nsearching for something the\nwhole time I was out doing\nresearch. Maybe it got separated\nfrom its Deerling...

Mis_Stage008_039_01_Head	Climbing the Lavafall

Mis_Stage008_187_01_Head	Typhlosion Explosion

Mis_Stage009_167_01_Head	You Can Do It, Vanilluxe!
Mis_Stage009_167_01_Info1	Vanilluxe got startled by Avalugg\nand ran away. Maybe it’ll feel\nbetter if you give it a fluffruit!
Mis_Stage009_167_01_Info2	Oh, you gave it a fluffruit!\nThank you!
Mis_Stage009_168_01_Head	Proud Warrior
Mis_Stage009_168_01_Info1	Braviary is very proud, and it\ndoesn’t easily open up to\nanyone. What would you do to\nearn its trust?

Mis_Stage009_170_01_Head	Shades of Aurorus
Mis_Stage009_170_01_Info1	Aurorus’s fins change color\ndepending on its mood. Try\nobserving it closely to see what\ncauses them to change.

Mis_Stage009_172_01_Head	A Sheer Face

Mis_Stage009_172_01_Info2	Aha! You did see it! Avalugg is\nusually so level-headed, it’s a\nbit surprising to see it like this.

Mis_Stage009_269_01_Head	In the Blizzard
Mis_Stage009_269_01_Info1	Snom usually hide when I try to\ntake pictures of them, but earlier\nI saw them all come out at once.\nI wonder what happened.

Mis_Stage009_270_01_Head	Like Powder Snow
Mis_Stage009_270_01_Info1	Have you ever seen Frosmoth’s\nscales? They’re really beautiful,\njust like snow.

Mis_Stage010_045_01_Head	Gem Royalty
Mis_Stage010_045_01_Info1	Sometimes a pack of Carbink\nwill have a princess leading\nthem. I bet you could get a shot\nof some very happy Carbink if\nthe princess were around!

Mis_Stage010_046_01_Head	Sound Asleep
Mis_Stage010_046_01_Info1	I found a sleeping Sableye!\nI bet you’d just love to know\nwhere it is, huh? Ha! Too bad!
Mis_Stage010_046_01_Info2	Aw, you found it? I bet you\nalready knew where it was\nbefore I even told you...
Mis_Stage010_067_01_Head	Fur Standing On End
Mis_Stage010_067_01_Info1	So I can tell Jolteon’s mad in this\nphoto I took, but I dunno why...\nMaybe it saw something else in\nthere. The air was, like, crackling\nwith tension!
Mis_Stage010_067_01_Info2	Wait, huh? Its fur was standing\nup ’cause of a magnetic...field?\nIs that, like, a field that magnets\ngrow in? Weird, but cool!
Mis_Stage010_107_01_Head	Steelix Takes a Breather
Mis_Stage010_107_01_Info1	I get the feeling that Steelix and\nNoibat are pals. Do you think\nthey act differently when they’re\nalone together?

Mis_Stage010_184_01_Head	Gengar the Prankster
Mis_Stage010_184_01_Info1	Gengar keeps popping out of\nnowhere and playing its tricks!\nI’m a little worried about that\nsleeping Croagunk...
Mis_Stage010_184_01_Info2	I knew it! Gengar was up to its\ntricks here, too. Poor Croagunk...\nIt doesn’t deserve to be picked\non like this!
Mis_Stage010_188_01_Head	Crobat Touches Down
Mis_Stage010_188_01_Info1	I wonder if Crobat would come\ndown to the ground to eat\nfluffruit. It’s a bit of a clumsy\nwalker, so I doubt it’d land\nwithout a good reason...
Mis_Stage010_188_01_Info2	Wow! I see you got it to come\ndown to the ground after all.\nThis is a rare sight!
Mis_Stage010_202_01_Head	Look My Way

Mis_Stage010_219_01_Head	Anger Outlet
Mis_Stage010_219_01_Info1	Rampardos has this one habit—\nyou could call it a specialty, I\nguess. It’s something you can\nprobably imagine it doing when\nit’s mad.
Mis_Stage010_219_01_Info2	Now that’s a mighty headbutt!\nHope it doesn’t cause a cave-in...
Mis_Stage010_220_01_Head	Drifloon Puffed Up
Mis_Stage010_220_01_Info1	I saw a Drifloon...I think? There\nwas something weird about it.\nLike, am I imagining things, or is\nits head way bigger than usual?
Mis_Stage010_220_01_Info2	So it WAS a Drifloon! It was just\npuffed way up! What’s it full\nof, anyway?
Mis_Stage010_222_01_Head	Croagunk Chorus
Mis_Stage010_222_01_Info1	These Croagunk’s cries each\nseem to be a specific note. I have\na hunch something will happen\nif they sing in the right order!
Mis_Stage010_222_01_Info2	My hunch was right! They seem\nto be pleased to have croaked\nout a do-re-mi.
Mis_Stage010_239_01_Head	Joltik Adjoined
Mis_Stage010_239_01_Info1	Joltik has a pretty unusual way\nof feeding itself. If you see one\nnear another Pokémon, make\nsure you watch closely.
Mis_Stage010_239_01_Info2	That’s it! Joltik feeds on other\nPokémon’s static electricity.\nNice job getting a shot of it\nin action.
Mis_Stage010_244_01_Head	Hydreigon Berserk!
Mis_Stage010_244_01_Info1	I wanna get a close-up shot of\nHydreigon! Think it’d come to me\nif I gave it a fluffruit? Hmmm, I\nwonder if it even eats ’em.

Mis_Stage010_252_01_Head	Having a Goodra Time
Mis_Stage010_252_01_Info1	This Goodra seems kind of\nrestless. Do you get the feeling\nit’s waiting for something\nto happen?

Mis_Stage010_254_01_Head	Myth of the Cave
Mis_Stage010_254_01_Info1	I think I caught a flash of pink\nlight near all those big crystals.\nBut maybe I just imagined it?

Mis_Stage011_075_01_Head	Fading into the Shadows
Mis_Stage011_075_01_Info1	I have a hunch that a Pokémon is\nhiding in this area, but...maybe\nit’s just my imagination?
Mis_Stage011_075_01_Info2	Oh, it was an Umbreon!\nThanks for looking into that!
Mis_Stage011_110_01_Head	The Power of Xerneas
Mis_Stage011_110_01_Info1	The Illumina energy in this area\nseems particularly strong. We\nmay be able to observe Xerneas\nbehaving in new ways here.
Mis_Stage011_110_01_Info2	Thank you for investigating! I can\ntell from this photo there must\nhave been a tremendous amount\nof energy there!
Mis_Stage011_192_01_Head	Just Perching Here
Mis_Stage011_192_01_Info1	I threw a fluffruit earlier, and a\nNatu came down and perched on\nit! It was so adorable!

Mis_Stage011_194_01_Head	Houndoom’s Breather
Mis_Stage011_194_01_Info1	Houndoom always seems to be\non guard, keeping an eye on its\nsurroundings. I wonder if it ever\ngets tired.
Mis_Stage011_194_01_Info2	Oh, I see! I suppose it stretches\nlike this every now and then to\nrelease tension.
Mis_Stage011_216_01_Head	Myth of the Ruins
Mis_Stage011_216_01_Info1	Have a look at this crystal here.\nIf I ever get a chance to meet the\nPokémon sleeping inside, I’d\nlove to see it grant a wish.

Mis_Stage011_234_01_Head	A Break between Patrols

Mis_Stage011_242_01_Head	Drowsing Beheeyem
Mis_Stage011_242_01_Info1	I could’ve sworn I saw Beheeyem\nsleeping while it was floating in\nthe air. I’m not sure, though...\nCould you check for me?
Mis_Stage011_242_01_Info2	So it wasn’t my imagination!\nWell, Beheeyem’s out and about\nall the time. I guess it needs a\nbreak now and then!
Mis_Stage011_256_01_Head	Salandit’s Battle Plan
Mis_Stage011_256_01_Info1	This is the aftermath of a battle!\nIt was so exciting, I forgot to take\npictures, but if you ever see the\nrematch, you’re in for a treat!
Mis_Stage011_256_01_Info2	So you were able to get in on the\naction! Noivern was cool, too, but\nSalandit’s counterattack was\nsomething else!
Mis_Stage011_262_01_Head	A White Pokémon
Mis_Stage011_262_01_Info1	Rita told me she saw a white,\nfour-legged Pokémon around\nhere. Let’s get a photo of it eating\nfluffruit and check with her!

Mis_Stage011_265_01_Head	Gracefully Gliding

TU_photo_07	If you use  to move  {color[0c00]}{color[ffff]}  around,\nthe camera will move to follow it.
TU_photo_08	Give it a try!
TU_photo_09	You can point the camera up and down—and\neven spin all the way around left or right!
TU_photo_28	You can use {color[0000]}motion controls{color[ffff]}\nto aim your camera, too!
TU_photo_10	Oooh, look!\nHere comes Pikachu.
TU_photo_11	Try getting a shot of that {color[0000]}Pikachu{color[ffff]}!
TU_photo_12	First, move  {color[0c00]}{color[ffff]}  so it’s lined up\nwith Pikachu.
TU_photo_13	You can move  {color[0c00]}{color[ffff]}  using .\nTry lining up  {color[0c00]}{color[ffff]}  with Pikachu.
TU_photo_14	Did you see that {color[0000]}shape {color[ffff]}appear\naround Pikachu just now?
TU_photo_15	Whatever that shape is around is the\n{color[0000]}subject of your photo{color[ffff]}. Remember that!
TU_photo_16	It’ll be important when the professor’s\nevaluating your photos!
TU_photo_27	Try snapping a photo!
TU_photo_17	That’s it! Great job!
TU_photo_18	But since Pikachu’s a little far\naway, it looks kinda small, huh?
TU_photo_19	Times like this call for {color[0000]}zooming in{color[ffff]}!
TU_photo_20	To zoom in, just hold .\nYou’ll stay zoomed in until you let go.
TU_photo_21	Try snapping a photo of Pikachu\nlooking nice and big!
TU_photo_22	Hold  to zoom in, and\npress  to take a photo.
TU_photo_23	Great! See how much bigger\nit looked that time?
TU_photo_24	You want your subject’s {color[0000]}whole body smack-dab{color[ffff]}\n{color[0000]}in the middle{color[ffff]} of the frame, {color[0000]}looking big{color[ffff]}!
TU_photo_25	Looks like you’ve already gotten the hang\nof using your camera. You’re doing great!
TU_photo_29	Oh, right—you can adjust your camera and\nmotion controls from the {color[0000]}Settings menu{color[ffff]}!
TU_photo_30	You can also adjust them from the {color[0000]}pause menu{color[ffff]}\nwhile you’re out doing research!
TU_photo_26	Hey, Professor!\nWe’ve covered the basics!
EB_Tu_01	How was that? I hope you’re getting the hang of your\nresearch camera.
EB_Tu_02	Now then, I’ll evaluate the photos you took.
EB_Tu_03	Would you mind choosing {color[0000]}one shot of each Pokémon{color[ffff]}\nyou photographed?
EB_Tu_04	I’ll rate them using my special scoring system.
EB_Tu_05	Pick whichever shots you think are the best!
EV_Mot_Tu_01	Starting with photo number one...
EV_Mot_Tu_02	The first thing I do is rate each photo from one to four {color[0000]}★ (stars){color[ffff]}.
EV_Mot_Tu_03	I came up with this system to help us understand and categorize how\nPokémon behave.
EV_Mot_Tu_04	Photos of Pokémon in an ordinary state get fewer ★.\nMore unusual behavior means more ★.
EV_Mot_Tu_05	Simple enough, right?
EV_Mot_Tu_06	To be clear, the number of ★ a photo receives doesn’t affect its\nscore. Every category is important!
EV_Mot_Tu_07	By the way, the camera keeps logs of what was happening when you\ntook each photo. That data helps me categorize your photos.
EV_Mot_Tu_08	Let’s move on to the scoring.\nFirst, I’ll evaluate the subject’s {color[0000]}pose{color[ffff]}.
EV_Mot_Tu_19	Snapping your photo at {color[0000]}just the right moment{color[ffff]} is key to getting a high\npose score!
EV_Mot_Tu_09	Now, on to the other factors.
EV_Mot_Tu_10	{color[0000]}Size {color[ffff]}is straightforward—the larger your subject Pokémon appears in\nthe photo, the better.
EV_Mot_Tu_11	Then there’s the {color[0000]}direction{color[ffff]} the Pokémon is facing. Try to get it facing\nyou in your photos!
EV_Mot_Tu_12	Next is {color[0000]}placement{color[ffff]}. Try to get the Pokémon in the center of the frame\nfor a nice, balanced photo.
EV_Mot_Tu_13	And finally, you’ll get bonus points if {color[0000]}other Pokémon{color[ffff]} are in the photo\nwith your subject Pokémon!
EV_Mot_Tu_14	Now, I know that was a lot of info all at once.
EV_Mot_Tu_15	Let me boil it down.\nRemember this, and you’ll do fine:
EV_Mot_Tu_16	Get the Pokémon nice and big in the center of the frame, then snap\nthe shutter!
EV_Mot_Tu_17	With all that in mind, here’s your evaluation.
EV_Mot_Tu_18	Looking good!\nHard to believe you’re a beginner!
EA_Tu_Rlv_01	What did you think?
EA_Tu_Rlv_02	Once you get your photos evaluated, you can use them\nto fill out your very own {color[0000]}Pokémon Photodex{color[ffff]}.
EA_Tu_Rlv_03	That will be a great milestone to work toward!
EA_Tu_Rlv_05	That about does it.\nI think it’s time you set off on your adventure!
TU_search_01	Running a {color[0000]}scan {color[ffff]}is easy.\nAll you gotta do is press .
TU_search_02	Try it out!
TU_search_03	Press  to run a scan.
TU_search_04	You saw that Pokémon’s name\npop up, right?
TU_search_06	And did you also notice that  {color[0b00]}{color[ffff]} ?
TU_search_07	That tells you there’s something\nyou can take a closer look at!
TU_search_08	First, move  {color[0c00]}{color[ffff]}  over the  {color[0b00]}{color[ffff]} .
TU_search_09	Use  to move  {color[0c00]}{color[ffff]}  so it’s on\nthe  {color[0b00]}{color[ffff]} .
TU_search_10	Did you see  {color[0c00]}{color[ffff]}  change shape?
TU_search_11	That’s your cue to press and hold \nto analyze whatever’s there.
TU_search_12	Give it a try!
TU_search_13	Hold  to run an analysis.
TU_search_14	There! Now you should see\nthe results.
TU_search_15	Come to think of it, I heard that a friend of the\nprofessor’s came up with the name “NEO-ONE.”
TU_search_16	Well? Pretty easy, right?
TU_search_17	When this icon pops up at the bottom of your\nscreen, there’s something nearby to check out.
TU_search_18	When you see that, try running a scan\nand taking a careful look around.
TU_search_19	Oh, right—I almost forgot!
TU_search_20	There’s one more cool thing you\nshould know about scanning.
TU_search_21	Some Pokémon will react to the sound\nand electrical signal from the scan.
TU_search_22	If it gets their attention, that’s\nyour chance to snap a photo!
TU_search_23	The professor calls it an accidental\n“Say cheese!” feature.
TU_search_24	Anyway, that ought to\ncover everything!
TU_food_01	You can throw a {color[0000]}fluffruit{color[ffff]} by\npressing . Give it a try!
TU_food_02	Press  to throw a fluffruit\nfor a Pokémon.
TU_food_03	There. See? It came to get a bite!\nWho doesn’t love a little snack?
TU_food_04	You can move  {color[0c00]}{color[ffff]}  around\nto aim your throw.
TU_food_05	It’s the same as aiming\nyour camera.
TU_food_06	Just move  to aim, then\npress  to throw.
TU_food_07	Give it another try!
TU_food_08	Oh! Looks like you startled it.\nBut these don’t hurt, so it’ll be fine.
TU_food_09	Take a few more\npractice throws!
TU_food_10	If you want to throw farther,\naim a little bit higher.
TU_food_11	Some Pokémon might not be interested.\nMaybe they’re more cautious than hungry.
TU_food_12	Aim using , then\npress  to throw.
TU_food_13	All right! That should be\nenough practice.
TU_food_16	Don’t forget what\nI told you, OK?
