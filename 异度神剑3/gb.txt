0	1	Back when we were in Colony 9,\nthose Bunnits sure made our lives\npretty miserable...
1	6	What? Why? They're such\nlittle cutie-wooties!
2	5	"Cutie-wooties"? Even the ones holding\ngiant weapons in their tails? Even those,\nI ask?
3	6	Urk... Yeah, OK, those are scary...
4	1	We've once had to push through whole\nbevies of them to get back to the colony\nfrom Yzana Plains.
5	3	Oh yeah, I remember that...\nNot gonna lie, I don't miss it.
6	5	Am I remembering right that it started\n'cause Fox tried starting a fight with\ntheir Bunnit leader, or something?
7	2	Oh, like they came for revenge?
8	4	Bunnits do tend toward collective behavior.\nMoreover, the ones holding weapons are\nknown to be aggressive.
9	5	When a hundred or more of the snuffers\ncome at you at once, it ain't fun. And it's\nnot like their meat is any good, either...
10	6	So when fighting Bunnits,\nkeep an eye on their numbers...\nNoted. Good talk, guys!
evt/ask/msg_ask110004.json
0	4	Noah, was it your colony that fought\nColony Sigma at Everblight Plain?
1	1	Yeah, it was... You've heard about the battle?
2	4	Everblight Plain, now that's a name that\nkeeps coming up. It seems to be the\nbattlefield of choice for a lot of colonies.
3	4	I imagine it's because the open wasteland\nthere is perfect for large melees that even\nFerronises can clash in.
4	3	No wonder it's so blasted to ash\nthat not a single blade of grass\ncan grow there.
5	1	And until we can put an end to\nthe fighting, it'll most likely stay\nthat way, true to its moniker...
6	2	...I hope one day the war will be over,\nand it can grow lush and verdant just\nlike Yzana Plains.
evt/ask/msg_ask110005.json
0	3	Oi, Taion. You've been keepin' up with\nyour Agnus textbook reading, right?
1	3	Isn't that a bit pointless now?\nI mean, since we're all on the\nsame side and all that...
2	4	...Here's the thing. Before we became\nOuroboros, I believed implicitly that every\nword in there was correct and accurate.
3	4	That if I practiced what it taught,\nall would turn out to the benefit\nof my colony and my Queen.
4	4	But now? Now I know, as do we all, that\nit was no more than a Moebius deception.
5	3	Right, so why waste any more time on it?
6	4	Because if you think about it, the textbooks\ncontain information advantageous to the\nMoebius. Do you see what I'm saying?
7	4	If I can reverse-engineer and analyze this\n"advantageous information", I can find out\nabout their real goals and intentions.
8	3	...Whoa! So you're reading them to,\nlike, learn more about your enemy!
9	4	Information forms the basis of strategy.\n...That's elementary tactician know-how.
10	4	But it's also not like everything in there\nis backwards nonsense, either. Consider\nthe case of Colony 9's fields, for instance.
11	3	So we can't blindly trust what we read,\nwe have to sort through the information\nand make our own minds up?
12	4	I'm glad you're so quick on the uptake.
evt/ask/msg_ask110008.json
0	3	Anyone else get the feeling\nColony 9 folks might be eating\na bit too many Spongy Spuds...?
1	6	Seemed to me like they really\nfell in love with them, yeah.\nThey seem to be always eating them.
2	5	Eating 'em's one thing, but\ndid you hear 'em talkin' about\n"saving Aionios" with 'em?
3	4	Isn't that what we're doing too,\ncuriously enough?
4	3	'Course it's not! ...Uh, or is it?
5	2	Well, if nothing else, Spongy Spuds are\nhelping ease the food shortages, so people\ndon't have to fight so hard over resources.
6	2	And if they don't have to fight,\nisn't that saving the world...?\nIn some sense, at least?
7	3	Don't get me wrong, I'm not arguing with\nthe logic, I'm just trying to point out that\nthere's an important point you're missing.
8	4	And that is...?
9	3	It's this: eating nothing but potatoes...\nis *boring* as all get-out!
10	tV	Manana cannot take that lying down!
11	tV	Potato cuisine contain hidden depth!\nAmount of possible variation so high,\nis practically endless!
12	tV	With wings of Manana at spatula,\ncan eat potatoes all life and never\nnot be satisfied!
13	2	Well, I daresay this might just be\nManana's time to shine, then.
14	5	Seeing as how that lot always basically\njust steam their spuds, I think that might\nbe a mercy.
15	tV	Manana will get on case immediately!\nTime to save world with potatoes is *now*!
evt/ask/msg_ask120002.json
0	3	Wonder if we've become more like Ethel...
1	5	What's that about Ethel?
2	3	I mean, like, we saved Kyrie from\nthe hands of the enemy earlier, yeah?
3	3	That's kinda like when Ethel\nsaved *us*, way back when...
4	5	Huh... Yeah, she did do that.\nHaven't thought about it in a while.
5	1	And this time, we were the rescuers...\nThat's kind of emotional to think about.
6	5	Oh, but remember, she took on a\nLevnis that day all by her own sparking\nself! And that was in her third term!
7	1	Uh... Yeah, she did do that.\nI guess if it were easy to be Ethel,\neveryone'd be doing it.
8	4	I'd heard rumors, but it seems they\nwere, if anything, vastly understated.\nWhat a formidable warrior...!
9	6	Wow, thinking about trying to match Ethel\nmakes me feel *less* confident than ever...
10	2	We can still work hard to become\nsomeone that someone else might want\nto emulate, how about that?
evt/ask/msg_ask120005.json
0	1	Taion, you used to belong to\nColony Lambda originally, right?
1	4	Yes. I was reassigned to Gamma.
2	4	You all know the story by now...\nI'd lost my way, but Commander Teach\npersonally welcomed me in.
3	3	Old Teach did? Huh!
4	4	Under normal circumstances, you have to\nindicate a clear reason for transferring...\nBut he didn't ask me a thing.
5	4	Thinking back to it now, I suppose\nCommander Isurd must have put in\na word for me.
6	2	Sena and I came to Gamma at\njust about the same time.\nThen we got put in the same unit.
7	5	Phewww... So you guys've been\ntogether all the way since then?
8	4	Yes... Isn't it strange? If tragedy hadn't\nstruck in the way it did, I never would've\nmet Mio and Sena.
9	4	...Nor you guys.
10	1	Are you saying that everything\nhappened for a reason...?
11	4	...I don't know if I'd go that far.\nBut certainly, that outlook would make it\neasier to stay optimistic as we go on.
evt/ask/msg_ask120007.json
0	3	Hey, have you noticed that we set out\nfrom the Aetia region, and then came\nright back again?
1	5	Oh spark, you're right...\nWow, talk about a waste of effort.
2	4	Of course it wasn't a waste. We had no\nway of knowing the Cloudkeep was there\nat the start of our journey.
3	6	And even if we'd known, we\nwouldn't have been able to\nget inside anyway.
4	tV	Most important things in life\nare closest to hand, but\nhardest to find, meh.
5	3	...
6	5	...
7	tV	...Hm? Something wrong?
8	3	Uh, nah, it's just...
9	6	Kind of surprising to hear that sort of thing\ncoming from you...?
10	tV	...How so? Did friends take Manana\nfor some kind of blithely happy-go-lucky\ndummypon?
11	5	...
12	3	...
13	4	...
14	tV	...Why friends look away?
evt/ask/msg_ask120008.json
0	4	So, here's a story from a few years ago.
1	4	Back then, Colony Chi was renowned\nas Agnus's preeminent military power.
2	4	They cut down their enemies to the last,\nhunting down all escapees and stragglers\nwithout mercy. In a word, vicious.
3	4	Colony Chi were an unstoppable force, and\ntheir rise through the ranks was inexorable.\nEveryone knew they were bound for Gold.
4	1	...But they never reached it?
5	4	Correct... According to their battle records,\nChi was achieving startling results...
6	4	But the numbers of their friendly casualties\nwere also rising in direct proportion.
7	3	So what, they were sacrificing people\nto win? I'm surprised they managed to\nkeep that up for long...
8	4	They were winnowing their troops.\nAs a result, only the strongest fighters\nsurvived.
9	4	No enemy could stand against Chi, whose\nranks were composed solely from grizzled\nveterans. They were utterly trampled.
10	5	...Without mercy, yeah?
11	4	No mercy for their foes, and none for\ntheir allies either. In their view, only\nmight made right...
12	4	Such was Colony Chi...\nunder Commander Oleg.
13	6	"Oleg", huh...
14	3	...But in the end, it was unsustainable,\nright?
15	4	Right. The end came during the battle at\nRottswoe Battlescar, where Chi completely\nannihilated several opposing colonies.
16	4	According to the records,\nOleg was also killed in that battle.\nBut then...
17	2	Oleg... That's Teach's real name...
18	4	...Thinking back to it now, the commander\ndid always try to instill in us a certain\ncaution toward "power"...
19	4	He may have been trying to warn us\nagainst the mistakes he himself made\nback when he was still Oleg...
20	2	...
21	1	...Teach did say that it was up to us\nto decide how to act, now that we've\nlearned the truth.
22	1	This doesn't change my thoughts on him.\nWhatever his past, Teach is our ally...\nMore than that, he's our friend.
23	1	What do you guys think?
24	5	I've said it before and I'll say it again,\ncan't have too many strong mates.
25	3	Same here, I don't mind too much.\nOther people's pasts are frankly none\nof my business.
26	4	I believe the commander has been trying\nto reckon with his past in his own way.\n...Only he can do it.
27	6	...Commander Teach was always kind\nto me and Mio when we moved there\nfrom Colony Theta.
28	6	It wouldn't be right to doubt him now.\nI... I trust the commander.
29	2	I'm with Sena on this.\n...Looks like we're all agreed,\nin fact.
30	1	Yeah, it's as Taion said.\nTeach's actions now are up to him.
31	1	But if he needs our help again,\njust like before, we'll be there\nto support him in a heartbeat.
32	2	Of course!\nAs real friends and allies should.

0	3	Here's something that's been bugging me...\nWhy did No. 9 have an off-seer's flute?
1	3	Here's something that's been bugging me...\nWhy did Fline have an off-seer's flute?
2	6	You know what, I asked her later, actually.\nShe said she was trying to become one.
3	6	Unlike other colonies, Colony 0\nnever had an off-seer, apparently.
4	1	...So she's been trying to send on\nher fallen comrades herself?
5	3	Whoa... What a good egg, that one!\nThorny demeanor notwithstanding...
6	2	If she cares deeply about others,\nthat might be exactly why she gets\nemotional and overwhelmed so easily.
7	6	Yeah! I really, really get that...\nI just wish she'd open up to us a bit more.
8	2	Slow and steady wins the race, Sena.\nYou'll just have to be patient with her.
9	6	Yes, I know...
evt/ask/msg_ask140001.json
0	5	So, you guys know those supply drops\nwe've been seein' now and again...?
1	6	Yeah? What about them?
2	5	Colonies we've freed from their Clocks,\nthey can't request supplies, can they?
3	4	...No, that wouldn't make any sense.
4	4	The drops are aid from one of the\nCastles, or neighboring friendlies.
5	4	Even if one of the liberated Colonies\ndid file a request, nobody has a duty\nto honor it.
6	2	Which means that wherever we see\nsupplies being dropped, there must be\na Colony or troops we haven't freed yet...
7	1	Yeah. There's a good chance we'd\nencounter enemies in those areas.
8	4	Indeed. When we see a supply drop,\nwe'll have to remain vigilant.
9	5	But those containers will have stuff\nwe'll need as well, am I right?
10	5	If we can get our hands on 'em,\nI say we should. Even with the\nenemies and all.
evt/ask/msg_ask140002.json
0	1	You see Glitter Radishes growing all over\nthe place in the Fornis region, huh...
1	5	Yeah, no joking. At first I thought\nit was just some kinda weed.
2	tV	That offensive against radishes everywhere.\nGlitter Radish is not only delicious, but also\ncover all bases nutritionally!
3	4	The misapprehension is understandable.\nThey do tend to spread like wildfire when\nthey're in season.
4	3	Ugh... That brought back memories,\nand not the good kind...
5	2	You use these Glitter Radishes\nquite a lot in your cooking as well,\ndon't you, Manana?
6	tV	Very muchly! Glitter Radish even\nadd aesthetic appeal, making for\nvery good and versatile ingredient.
7	tV	Only need peeling, as skin is tough.\nAnd also to take out stringy bits...
8	tV	But after boil for a few hours\nand be sure to strain off scum\nlayer, then yes, very tasty!
9	6	Sounds like a lot of work for a radish...
10	tV	Want to eat but tough to eat...\nThat is what Manana call dilemma...
11	5	Eh, doesn't bother me. I'm a simple man.\nIf it's good, I'll polish it off!
12	tV	Then Lanz can take peeling duty.\nIf not have to work for joy of eat,\nthe pleasure much diminish.
13	5	Uh, what...? Sheesh, can nobody\ntake a joke these days?
evt/ask/msg_ask140003.json
0	6	So, uh... Word on the grapevine has it that\nAgnus and Keves patrols are on the rise.
1	5	Yeah, now you mention it, they've\nbeen all over the place lately.
2	4	Hmm. It's conceivable that if we act\nconspicuously, the nations' troops will\nbe placed on higher alert.
3	2	And destroying Flame Clocks\nseems pretty conspicuous, all\nthings considered.
4	4	Indeed. I doubt the Consuls would\noverlook such irregularities.
5	4	So we might expect more vigilance\nfrom them. More reinforcements.
6	5	Right, makes sense I s'pose.
7	1	But releasing colonies from their\nFlame Clocks can't be all bad.
8	2	For sure. It gained us the cooperation\nof their people, for one.
9	4	It's had its benefits,\nthat much is indisputable.
10	3	So long story short, we've just gotta up\nthe ante, like what our "pals" are doing.
11	1	Absolutely. We can't afford to slip up.
evt/ask/msg_ask140004.json
0	6	Snow's so pretty...\nI love it so much!
1	3	Yeah...no. It's cold, and it can\nfreeze your arse off... Give me\na sunny beach any day.
2	2	Really? I much prefer it\nto the heat, myself.
3	3	Yeah, 'cause you hate nice things, innit.\nRemember when you were all, "augh, it's\nso hooot, I'm gonna melt into a pancake"?
4	2	I said no such thing!
5	3	Oh yeah? I distinctly remember it!\n"No moooree... Someone kill me nooow...!"
6	2	I did not!
7	6	Uhm... Oh, that's right, now I remember.\nWhen you're feeling cold, you have to try\nand move your body!
8	3	Nope, uh-uh, no way.\nI've already gone on the defensive.\nGonna stay bundled up, thanks.
9	6	C'mon, just shout yourself warm!
10	3	Yeah right, and I suppose Mio coulda\njust yelled herself cool, huh?
11	2	I just struggle with the heat, all right?!
12	3	Honesty's a virtue, love.
13	2	...I'll never hear the end of this, will I?
14	5	Uh, Noah? What's this all about?
15	1	...Beats me.
evt/ask/msg_ask210001.json
0	5	Looks like wrecking a Flame Clock isn't\nenough to make everyone be like us.
1	1	Yeah...
2	1	They don't have to worry about\nthe clock, but everything apart\nfrom that stays the same.
3	3	Guess it's just us that can Interlink,\nchange Blades and so on...?
4	5	Bit of a shame though, innit?\nThe trick with using other Blades\nis pretty sparkin' useful.
5	1	Lanz, have you got comfortable\nwith using Sena's Blade yet?
6	5	Yeah, more or less.
7	5	Uh, still workin' on that one, mate...
8	5	I'll tell you this though, bashing\nenemies around with that thing\nis a real bloody kick.
9	5	Oh, hey, here's a thought.\nWhy don't we all try using\nSena's Blade at once?
10	5	Offense is the best defense, right?\nWe'd be done in no time!
11	4	Done and dusted as\nhusks on the ground, yes.
12	5	Whaddya mean?!
13	4	Attackers like Sena can only focus on the\noffense when they've got a Defender to\ncover them.
14	4	You have to maintain a balance in team\ncomposition. Going all-in on any one role\nwould only risk total defeat.
15	5	Bah... Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you're right.\nIt's exactly as you say.
16	5	Here's what we do then. Taion, you do\nthe Defender thing, and everyone else\ngrabs Sena's Blade. Better, yeah?
17	4	Were you even listening to me...?\nOr does the word "balance" have\ntoo many syllables for you?!
evt/ask/msg_ask210003.json
0	2	It seems Millick Meadows isn't\nthe only place with a rusted-out\nFerronis, huh?
1	1	Yeah... If I had to guess, I'd say\nthey're scattered all over Aionios.
2	3	What bothers me is how totaled\nthey all are. Surely that can't be\nstandard practice, right?
3	4	Ferronises come in different Flame Clock\nranks. If they aren't used to their\nstrengths, the defeat can be crushing.
4	4	Retrieval and transportation of a Ferronis\nalso comes with costs. Leaving it to rot on\nthe field can sometimes be simplest.
5	5	And then it turns into a monster\nbreeding ground. Man, that makes\nmy blood boil a bit.
6	1	But even abandoned, they can contain\na wealth of supplies. I think they'll prove\nuseful on our journey.
7	2	For sure. If we see one anywhere,\nwe should make an effort to check\nit out.

3	5	And what's that stuff they vom up?\n'Cause to me, it looked just like...
4	3	STOP! Not a word more, I beg you.\nI'm already 105% creeped out...!
5	6	OK! Turning it around, then.\nWhat's a monster you like?
6	3	Well, duh! Pippitos, clearly?\nTheir fluffy fur just gives me life!\nI will hear no objections on this.
7	3	What about you, Sena love?
8	6	Ferises.
9	3	...Beg pardon?
10	6	Ferises! They're just cool, OK?\nAnd they have those massive triceps!\nI kinda wish I was one, honestly...
11	3	I-I see. Well, I s'pose there's\nno accounting for taste, innit.

0	5	D'you guys remember when we talked to\nEthel about directions to Swordmarch?
1	3	Phwoosh, that's a blast from the past...
2	5	Well, she said back then that anything\nthat comes close to the vortex in the\nGreat Sea gets ripped to shreds, yeah?
3	5	So, now we know why that is,\nand Origin's the reason.
4	4	That's right. Back then, I don't think\nwe could've imagined that something\nso huge was submerged there...
5	5	Right? So anyway, it got me thinking.
6	5	If we'd had Mr. Samon's Levnis back then\nalready, we could've just flown right over\nthe vortex! It'd've saved so much time!
7	3	Honestly, I'm just glad we've got\nthe little guy now.
8	XW1	Please not to discount Riku.\nWith enough time, could also have built.

0	3	The Nopon in Colony 30 sure seem\nto do whatever they please, huh.
1	3	Taking five after working five, snoozing\nmid-shift, or just plain wandering off...
2	5	They could just give 'em dog tags,\nsame as us, manage their time\nthat way?
3	4	That would certainly have its benefits.\nYou could monitor their comings and\ngoings with much more accuracy.
4	XW1	Friends must be joking!\nThat would evaporate all motivation,\nlike dew from Levnis on warm morning!
5	tV	That right! Nopon are free creatures,\nnot slaves to core working hours and\nquotas and tracking lunch breaks!
6	5	Oi, easy now, easy I say...\nNo need to get ticked off,\nit was all just hypothetical...
7	3	At least the Nopon of Colony 9 all\nseemed to be pretty serious about stuff.
8	6	Same for Colony Gamma, our guys and\ngals took their work more seriously than\nthose in Colony 30...
9	1	...Think it's Valdi's fault, then?
10	2	Hmm... May well be...
evt/ask/msg_ask220007.json
0	6	Lotsa Armus around Colony 30,\nisn't there?
1	5	Must be nice for them, lotsa food around.\nAnd Armu meat ain't nothing to scoff at.
2	4	You keep saying Armus this and Armus\nthat, but actually, the proper term would\nbe "Armuidae".
3	4	The ones with horns are Arduns, while\nthe ones without are Armus proper.
4	4	And speaking of meat quality,\nArmus have more subcutaneous fat,\nmaking theirs the more flavorful.
5	4	On the other hand, Ardun horns are rich\nin nutritious compounds, so people grind\nand mix them with water to drink.
6	4	Any other questions?
7	6	Oh, wow! I didn't know half of that!\nTaion, you're awesome.

3	H	Lanz, you are correct! And Taion,\nordinarily you would also be correct, but!
4	H	I wanna know what everyone's\nfavorite Levnises are!
5	5	You mean, like, do I prefer\nan Equites or a Velites...?
6	H	Exactly!

11	H	Noah? Mio? Favorite Levnis?
12	1	Hmm... I don't think I've ever\nlooked at Levnises through that\nparticular lens.
13	2	Me neither...
14	6	What's your fave, then, Valdi?

1	4	Once you hear that Ferronises are made\ninside it, it makes sense for their interest\nto be piqued.
2	3	You interested in it too then, Taion? Riku?
3	4	...It may not be the most prudent,\nbut I do find myself curious, yes.
4	4	I am burning to know how Moebius\nused Origin to create Aionios as we\nsee it today.
5	4	I imagine it must be similar for Riku.
6	XW1	Riku have no interest whatsoever.
7	4	What?
8	XW1	If we defeat Moebius, then Origin\nsurely of no consequence.
9	XW1	So, there no point in feeling curious.
10	3	I see, I see... Riku's got that cold intellect.\nMakes a person envious, eh, Taion?
11	4	C-could you please stop making it sound\nlike I'm some kind of weirdo...?!
12	5	Riku's always been a cool dude,\never since we first met.

3	1	I suppose there are all sorts,\neven among the Consuls...
4	1	There are some, like K at Colony 4,\nwho treat the soldiers like tools...
5	1	...and others, like at Colony Iota,\nwho allow the commanders to\nexercise their judgment.
6	4	Still, bottom line is, there would be\nno Collectopaedia Cards without\nAlexandria.

3	3	If you use enough of the Mondo,\ncould you get them to carry heavy\nstuff for you?
4	5	Since they're so tiny, can you use them\nto spy on enemies without 'em knowing?
5	6	Ohh, now we're dreaming big!\nWith enough Mondo, there's\nnothing we can't do, I bet!
6	4	Now you're letting your minds run away\nwith you. There are limits to how many\nMondo I can control, and to the range.
7	5	Oh, for real...? Well, that's a shame...
8	3	Yeah... Bit of an anticlimax...
9	6	Aww... I'm feeling let down, somehow...
10	4	...
11	4	Ngh... That said, nothing is impossible!\nWhen I truly apply myself, the Mondo's\ncapabilities are limitless.
12	5	Nice one, Taion!
13	3	I knew you had it in you, my guy!
14	6	You're the best, Taion! My hero!
15	4	Y-yeah, just... Just leave it to me.\nHeheh...eh...

0	2	It seems the supplies from Colony Iota\nare a lifeline for many other colonies.
1	5	The ones we handed out, yeah?\nIf people are usin' them, then it's\na job well done for us as well.
2	1	All we really did was operate\nthe Collectopaedia Cards, that's it.
3	1	I think it only went as well as it did\nthanks to Alexandria and Colony Iota\nstockpiling so many supplies.
4	3	You've got a point there.
5	3	They're definitely the ones who deserve\nkudos, for coming up with the\nCollectopaedia Cards and stuff.
6	3	...I wouldn't say that to\nAlex's face though, mind.
7	3	I don't think I could bear to watch her\nsmile that smug natural winner's smile\nagain...
8	2	Oh, really? I kinda like her smile.
9	6	Samesies.
10	5	...Not sure you're talking\nabout the same thing?
11	4	I also feel a little lost now...
evt/ask/msg_ask230008.json
0	1	Well, we've finished distributing the\nsupplies from Colony Iota to most\nof the other colonies.
1	6	Yeah! The warehouse is\nstarting to look pretty empty.
2	4	We cannot assume that the goods will\nsolve all problems across the board, but\nI believe they'll do for now.
3	2	Also, it'll have taught everyone to\nsupport one another, at least a bit.
4	3	More uses for the\nCollectopaedia Cards, too.
5	4	Yes, and not all of them planned from\nthe start, but ultimately a tool's uses are\ndetermined by the users...
6	4	Even if it was by accident, I do believe\nwe've struck upon a genuinely great tool.
7	5	"Accident", huh...? I can just imagine\nwhat Alexandria would say to that.
8	5	"All according to my prognoses",\nor some such...
evt/ask/msg_ask240001.json
0	3	Hey, so you know how there was\nall that black fog in Bennel Cave?
1	4	Yes?
2	3	That was, uh... That was pretty bad, right?
3	4	I only have the information I gained in the\nsurvey branch, but it's thought that the\nfog usually presages an annihilation event.
4	4	We escaped unscathed this time,\nbut there was a very real chance\nwe could have been caught in it.
5	5	Spark me...
6	4	Irritatingly, just noticing the fog\nwon't be enough to forewarn us\nof the event's occurrence.
7	3	Huh, so it's not that quick, then...?\nIs this gonna be a problem?
8	4	Well, it could happen anywhere between\na few minutes to several years from the\ntime of observation.
9	4	There's no direct correlation between\nspotting the black fog and the timing of\nthe event.
10	3	Urghh... Well that's just great news, innit...
11	1	Best not to get anywhere near it, then.
12	4	That's about the extent of it.\nNot that anyone's exactly been\ndiving into it with glee, anyway.

0	5	Riku, mate, question for ya.
1	XW1	Riku listen but not promise answer.
2	5	Couldn't me and Noah do some\ngem-crafting sometime?
3	XW1	Riku not understand how Lanz can ask\nsuch frankly blasphemous question while\nmaintain façade of innocence!
4	XW1	Of course answer is couldn't!
5	XW1	If try making gems without presence\nof professional like Riku, then whole\nthing doomed to definitive failure!
6	XW1	It nothing but waste of precious gemstone!\nVery bad for sustainability!
7	5	Surely it's not 100% certain\nwe'd fail, right?
8	5	If Noah and I just work in harmony,\nI'm really sure we could come out with\nsomething good.
9	XW1	That because part that Lanz play\nis extreme simple.
10	XW1	But for part which Riku perform,\nrequire specialist technique!
11	XW1	It take full ten years to master!
12	5	OK, cool, got it.\nI'll try that one next time then, yeah?
13	XW1	It like Lanz not even listen\nwhen Riku speak!!!
evt/ask/msg_ask240003.json
0	2	Those ether cylinders are pretty handy,\nhuh? We use them in Ferronis hulks,\nand for crafting gems as well...
1	4	They're a great replacement when\nyou no longer have a Flame Clock.
2	3	Then it'd be a no-brainer to carry\na couple of 'em around, no?
3	4	It's not that simple. First of all,\nyou have to find an ether channel\nbefore you can store the ether.
4	1	That is true... And you don't exactly\ntrip over those every day.
5	XW1	Then should use ether channel discoverer.
6	6	Is that a real thing?
7	XW1	Should be, if Riku not mistaken.\nWould make finding easy sneezy.
8	5	That would solve all our ether troubles...
9	XW1	Indeed. All have to do is load\nfive ether cylinders into discoverer,\nand it locate ether channel.
10	3	Whoa, that does sound simple...
11	3	...Wait, five cylinders?!
12	XW1	Find ether channel with few\nether cylinders' worth of ether,\nmachine require five cylinders.
13	3	That doesn't compute,\nat all!
14	XW1	Exactly why nobody use.
15	5	Man...\nyou got my hopes up...

0	1	The Nopon Caravan said it was attacked\nby a mysterious soldier, didn't it?
1	3	A mysterious soldier...\nSounds well spooky.
2	R	That was me.
3	3	You?! Queen's baubles, so our\nmystery guy was here all along!!!
4	R	They saw me.\nI intended to erase the evidence...
5	3	Now I think about it, when you met us\nfor the first time, you attacked us too!
6	R	Obviously.
7	6	Is it obvious...?\nI'm not sure it is...
8	R	I'm a shadow. The shadow of my friend,\nand of his daughter. I don't like being\nseen by others.
9	2	B-but... But you didn't end up\nwiping out the caravan, did you?
10	R	A little light intimidation was enough\nto shut them up, so I let it go. If they\nbecome a nuisance, I will erase them.
11	3	Dude, you really need to mellow out...
12	1	At any rate, the Nopon Caravan means you\nno harm, so I'm sure it won't come to that.
13	R	Let's hope.
14	3	Huh, I just realized. You got rumbled\nby a bunch of Nopon, eh? Wow, you\nmust've been real clumsy out there!
15	R	...Mrgh...
16	3	Whoa, easy there, Feris!\nPut away the weapons,\nwe're all friends here!

0	1	Phew...
1	3	Man, there's nothing better than kicking back\nand taking a load off, getting my kit all nice 'n\nclean... Best feeling in the world, bar none.
2	2	I totally agree. All the filth we pick up\non the road really wears you down...
3	2	Especially the sandstorms in\nDannagh Desert... They're just\ntoo much...
4	5	Yeah? Huh. All that stuff doesn't\nbother me one bit.
5	XW1	Riku also unbothered.
6	2	No way... Really?
7	XW1	Nopon not big on baths to begin with.
8	6	I guess that tracks, but Riku and Manana\nstill always look pretty clean, I thought.
9	XW1	Riku maintain strict standard of hygiene!\nIs good manners in polite society!
10	tV	Indeedy-doodle.\nIs question of etiquette.
11	XW1	That said, some Nopon can go\nwhole one week without bath.
12	6	Eww...
13	3	...Yeah, that's just mingin'.
14	XW1	Riku note that Lanz also only take bath\napproximately one time in week.

0	4	It looks like our marks don't disappear\neven after the Flame Clocks are smashed.
1	1	...Yeah. We're only freed from\nthe tyranny of the Flames...
2	2	It's true...\nA mark, once made, cannot be erased.
3	2	And once my tenth term ends...\nI'll be gone, after all...
4	3	It's not all doom and gloom though, yeah?\nBeing free from the Clocks, that's already\nsomething. Things feel different somehow.
5	6	I know what you mean!\nIt feels less anxious, like\nI can breathe a little easier...
6	1	Exactly... And ultimately, everyone has to\nchoose their actions for themselves.
7	1	Freedom from the Flame Clocks\nexpands one's options immeasurably.\nI think that's huge.
8	5	Yeah... Everyone's gotta die sometime.\nAt least this way they get to live the\ngood life first.
9	4	The "good life"...?\nWhat do you understand by that?
10	5	Huh? Well, I mean, like...\nEating good grub and stuff, yeah?

evt/ask/msg_ask310004.json
0	3	So, these Urayan Mountains...\nTo be honest, I kind of expected them\nto be a little more...mountainous?
1	2	Yeah... Makes you wonder whether\nsomeone misnamed the place...
2	4	Approximately half of the formation has\nbeen lost to annihilation events.
3	4	Keves Castle's Annihilator made\na dent too, adding insult to injury.
4	5	Wow, thanks for the reminder, mate...\nI don't really wanna think too long\nabout that snuffin' doomsday device.
5	4	Truthfully, neither do I.
6	6	Makes you wonder, though...\nD'you think one day, the entire world\ncould just...go up in smoke like that?
7	1	Not in our lifetimes, I don't think, but...\nMaybe decades, or even centuries\nafter we're gone...?
8	2	It's probably unavoidable, isn't it...?
9	1	Yeah...
10	3	That's, like, the deep-deep future...\nI don't think my brain can take me that far.
11	5	Well, we're still fine, but the lot that\ncomes after - ages and ages after - they'll\nbe kinda snuffed, huh?
12	1	Almost definitely... It might seem like\nthat's nothing to do with us, but that isn't\nquite right. What we do matters.
13	5	I'm with you. Can't just look the other\nway, pretend we don't see the effects of\nour actions. Even if it makes you feel bad...

0	5	Say, those Auto-Lev majiggers are\npretty nifty, eh?
1	4	Colony Lambda was once\ndefeated by Colony 13,\nowing to their special tactics...
2	4	Commander Isurd must have been deterred\nfrom fighting head-on, and requested them\nfrom the Castle.
3	3	The autonomous Levnises, you mean?
4	4	Yes. Historically, the Colony has performed\nadmirably; that must have contributed to\nthe request being granted.
5	4	The commander then used the Levnises\nand prevailed over Colony 13.
6	2	And they remained garrisoned at Lambda...
7	1	If they work without needing\na dedicated pilot, that in itself\nis already a big help.
8	3	And now for some reason,\nthey're all down in the tunnels.
9	4	They do have the advantage of safely\noperating in places which would otherwise\nbe very dangerous for humans.
10	3	Well then, massive kudos to\nwhoever came up with the idea.
11	4	Indeed. I'm sure Commander Isurd\nfigured out this particular usage scenario\nvery quickly.
12	5	Yeah, well, I gotta say I'd prefer\nnot to have to fight 'em again.
13	5	Far as I'm concerned, I'd be much\nhappier if those mudders just stuck\nto mining rocks...
evt/ask/msg_ask310006.json
0	2	I heard a lot about the strength of\nthe leadership at Colony Lambda...\nCare to comment, Taion?
1	4	Of course. Commander Isurd has\ncollected the cream of the crop\nunder his command.
2	4	One of Lambda's biggest achievements was\nthe strategy of constantly shifting formation\nto befuddle and demoralize the opponents.
3	6	That'd sure take some skills...
4	4	Formations that maintain cohesion while\nchanging form under precise orders...
5	4	They were said to be virtually unmatched\nwhen it came to large-scale engagements.
6	5	...Sounds like a far cry from Colony 9, huh.
7	1	To be fair, we mostly worked in\nsmall detachments. I don't remember\never seeing maneuvers on that scale.
8	3	Wonder how it would've gone if Colony 9\nwent up against Lambda... I'm guessing\nit'd have been a bad day out.
9	5	That's one way to say "massacre"...
10	4	Allow me to run a simulation.
11	4	Colony Lambda is putting up\na strong defense...
12	4	Colony 9 tires themselves out\non the assault, and is encircled\nby Colony Lambda forces...
13	4	Once clustered and immobilized, Colony 9\ntroops are fired upon by Auto-Levs...
14	4	All Colony 9 troops are\ncut down on the spot...
15	4	Another victory for Commander Isurd.
16	5	Mate... I think I'm detecting\na bit of bias there...
evt/ask/msg_ask310008.json
0	6	The Collectopaedia Cards have\nreally changed...
1	4	Indeed, you can now offer others presents,\nor use them for other people's benefit...\nA significant expansion to their purposes.
2	2	Alexandria and her people did mention it,\nbut seeing it in action really drives it home.
3	3	It never used to work\nlike this before, so yeah.
4	1	Destroying the Flame Clocks has led to\na gradual change in people's attitudes,\nI suppose.
5	1	They now want to help others,\nfoster friendships...
6	1	And they're using the cards\nto achieve those things.
7	2	That's...actually kind of nice,\nfor a change.
8	5	Yeah, it's cool to know that what\nwe're doing is making lives better.
9	3	Nice to see all these little\nthings adding up, ain't it?
10	6	Right! Many a mickle makes, uh, makes...\nIt makes a good positive change!
11	6	And it's thanks to us, you guys...\nLet's give ourselves a pat on the back.
evt/ask/msg_ask320002.json
0	3	Ey, I think we've gotten pretty good\nat using those rope slides!
1	2	Yeah! I feel quite used to them now.\nAnd they're a load of fun, too!
2	1	I feel like I've seen them around\nthe Fornis region as well.
3	4	Anything that makes traversal easier\nis a welcome tool as far as I'm concerned.
4	5	Since we're on the subject, what about\nthose rope launcher gizmos the militaries\nhave left all over the shop?
5	4	Ah, those? They're typically carried in\nand placed via Levnis. I'm afraid most\naren't in active use.
6	5	All right, but if we used them,\nwe might be able to get access\nto some new places, right?
7	3	Huh... That's actually a pretty good idea,\nif you ignore the guy that said it!
8	5	You didn't need that last part!
9	1	Good thinking, Lanz. Next time\nwe see one, let's try using it.
evt/ask/msg_ask320003.json
0	3	Colony Tau sure is a batty place, huh?
1	4	An understatement, if ever I heard one.\nIt's straining the definition of the word\n"Colony"...
2	2	Well, I like their rich\nnatural environment...
3	5	Yeah, that's about the only thing\nthey've got going for 'em. Even their\nClock was almost all the way out.
4	6	And they don't seem to\nuse their Ferronis much...
5	4	But conversely, that makes it harder for\nenemy troops to find them. There doesn't\nseem to be much traffic in the area.
6	1	Their Consul hardly even visits them.\nThey've been left to fend for themselves\nin so many ways...
7	2	Hard to believe they've survived\nthat way for so long...
8	4	It does beg the question, doesn't it?
9	1	It's a mysterious twist of fate that led us\nto meet and get to know them, truly.
10	6	Right? Maybe it wasn't so bad\ngetting shot at after all, eh, Eunie?
11	3	Excuse me?! How'd you like to be\non the receiving end next time?!
evt/ask/msg_ask320004.json
0	1	The people of Tau certainly\nknow their mushrooms.
1	2	I'm kind of envious... I still can't quite\ntell apart which ones are edible and\nwhich ones aren't.
2	tV	Manana must also brush up\non mushroomology.
3	XW1	Riku agree in totality.

7	tV	Manana will not make same mistake twice!\nFrom now, will spare no effort in pursuit\nof deep fungal knowledge!
8	tV	When discover mushrooms, will eat\nevery one! Then will definitely learn\nthrough experience!

14	2	Yeah, I think we'll have to...

0	1	Looks like the people who went from Tau\nto other Colonies have come back.
1	2	Those were Colonies we'd liberated,\nand we did notify them they'd be coming,\nso it's not like I was overly worried...
2	2	But still, it's no small feat to\nget there and back alone.
3	6	I don't think I could've made it...
4	3	Yeah, me neither...\nNot on my own, anyways.
5	4	And yet, as a learning experience,\nI'm sure it was invaluable.
6	1	I agree with you. It's bound to spur on\nColony Tau in all sorts of ways, expected\nand not.
7	5	Before this, the place was slowly headed\nfor the scrap heap, and no one would've\nbeen any the wiser.
8	5	They grabbed this opportunity\nand ran with it. Good on 'em.
9	4	Certainly...\nWe could stand to emulate their example.
evt/ask/msg_ask320006.json

2	tV	Friend Lanz stumble upon\nUltimate Question!
3	3	Not even close...
4	5	See, for my money, the Tau spud is best.\nIt's got that sweetness, and that little taste\nthat lingers...
5	2	Hmmm... I'm not sure, myself...
6	6	I think I might prefer the Colony 9 ones...?\nThey don't fall apart as easily. I like that\nthey're a bit more solid.
7	4	I suppose I'd have to go with Tau's.\nNo deep reasons though.
8	1	Yeah, I don't know that I can choose...
9	2	For me Tau edges it...I guess?\nI haven't really thought about it too deeply\neither. They were just...good? I think?
10	XW1	Riku have soft spot for Colony 9 potato.\nAfter witness struggles of Zeon to grow,\neating elicit feelings of sympathy.
11	3	Hmmm, you make a good point.\nAll right, Zeon gets my vote too then!
12	5	Well that's got nothin' to do with\nthe taste any more, does it...

2	tV	No needing for concerning!\nCooking is whole life of Manana.
3	tV	Food from colony canteens is fine\nand all, but when comes to feeding\nfriends, Manana want to do by self.
4	tV	Can adjust menu based on preferences\nand dietary requirements... Will not get\nsimilar service in canteen, that for sure!
5	2	Manana's cooking is really what lets us\nface each day with a renewed vigor.
6	tV	Needless to say, eheh!
7	tV	...Or so Manana front, but actually,\nwouldn't mind eating at colony canteens\nfrom time to time.

0	4	Riku, I've been thinking. The Nopon\nCaravans, they move around on Levnises,\ncorrect?
1	XW1	Correct. What of?
2	4	I just realized, regular Levnises cannot\nnormally operate too far from their home\ncolony, due to ether cylinder limitations.
3	4	So how is it that the caravans\nget around everywhere?
4	XW1	Reason is simple.\nCaravan Levnises small and lightweight.
5	XW1	Also, not loaded up with weaponry,\nand fundamentally not expected to fight.\nThat why ether consumption much lower.
6	4	I see... Yes, that makes sense.\nThat explains how they're able\nto operate over long distances.
7	XW1	In other words, very green energy.
8	4	...Huh? How can energy be inexperienced?
9	XW1	...It just mean power consumption is low.
10	4	Understood. Thank you for\nexplaining, Riku. It's been a\ngood learning experience.

1	6	The caravan folks said it's been\ngoing on for over a thousand years.
2	5	That's a long time to keep at a war, that...\nAlmost like Keves and Agnus, huh.
3	5	If you look at us from the outside,\nwould we seem just like them...?
4	4	Unusual for you to be so maudlin, Lanz.\nDid the family resemblance get you feeling\nnostalgic?
5	5	Shut the snuff up, mate!\nI'm allowed to have a deep thought\njust as much as you are, you arse...
6	4	Jokes aside, just like us, the monsters\nfight to protect their territory, to keep\nthemselves safe and fed, alive.
7	4	In that sense, there is no large difference\nbetween us and them... You weren't wrong\nin your assessment, Lanz.
8	6	But if they're like us, couldn't they\nlearn to get along someday?
9	5	...You mean, like we did?
10	6	Yeah, exactly!
11	4	It's hard to tell with certainty, but\nour existence serves as proof of the\npossibility.
12	4	Perhaps even those creatures will find\nsome common ground and attain peace,\nsomeday... Don't you think so, Lanz?
13	5	...Wow, never thought I'd live to see\nthe day where you try to cheer me up.

0	6	I did always wonder why Keves Castle\nwas in a place with that much black fog...
1	6	Guess it's so that they can\nuse the Annihilator, huh?
2	4	Of course, that's likely part of it...
3	4	But if they have a way to convert the fog\ninto energy, then the uses for it need not\nremain limited to the Annihilator.
4	3	If I stop to think about it, the tech there\nis kinda amazing. It could seriously turn\nthe world on its head, innit.
5	4	I'm sure the Moebius have it sequestered\naway precisely to avoid that outcome.
6	5	...And then we went and wrecked it.
7	1	Until now, we've always been\nthe ones being chased.
8	1	I think it was a good chance to show\nthat we can and will strike back at them.
9	6	Next time let's go even bigger!
10	5	Yeah! We'll show 'em what us\nOuroboros boys and girls are\nmade of!
11	2	Come on... I get that you're excited,\nbut please try to remember what it is\nwe're actually trying to achieve, hm?

0	5	Mate, I'm sooo jealous!\nThese Colony 11 mudders get to\neat meat for three meals a day...
1	6	Bet that's why they're so strong, too.\nMeat! It's almost like magic!
2	5	Oi, Manana... Could we shift to\na meat-first diet as well, eh?\nWhaddya say?
3	tV	Nopington nopes, from Colony Nope!\nFriends have to eat their veggies also.
4	tV	Also, if eat Mallow-o'-the-Marsh or\nGlare Aubergine, it promote muscle growth\nsame or even better than meat!
5	6	Even though they're veggies?
6	tV	Friends should not look down on veg!\nProper nutrition is like handstand pushup,\nmost important is balance!
7	tV	In additionality, if include Chewy Radish or\nPurple Pepper in meal plan, effects grow\nex-po-nen-tia-lly!
8	5	Whoa... That's good to know, Manana.\nThen let's have us a bit of that!
9	tV	However, that diet improve circulation\nso much that also come with elevated risk\nof nosebleed. Friends still want despite?
10	6	Uhm, that's...maybe a bit extreme...
11	5	Yeah, what... What was it you were\nsaying about balance, before...?
evt/ask/msg_ask410007.json
0	2	Doesn't Colony 11's Ferronis\nlook a bit like an Aspar?
1	2	...I'm sorry to mention it,\nI know Eunie hates them.
2	3	Ayyup.
3	5	It really is a weird shape, though.\nWould love to see it in a real scrap.
4	5	...Oh, sorry. I guess Eunie\nwould prefer not to see that.
5	3	Yep!
6	6	Seems like it'd be super strong\nat sea as well, don't you think?
7	6	Like, it could probably swim like a fish,\nor come up from the water like "GWOAR!"
8	6	Even you'd wanna see *that*, surely?\nYou would, wouldn't you, Eunie?
9	3	I would not.
10	4	I wonder if the Ferronis also ejects\nthings from its mouth. But what kind\nof things, hmm...
11	4	Eunie, what do you think?
12	3	Nothing! Nothing at all.
13	tV	Manana wondering, for dinner tonight,\ndo friends prefer Piranhax steaks or\nAspar skewers...?
14	3	That DOES it! I've HAD it!\nAll of you! Out front! NOW!\nYou want a fight, I'll give you one!
15	1	Eu-Eunie, come on, there's\nno need for bloodshed!
16	2	I'm really sorry!\nI guess we took it too far this time...
evt/ask/msg_ask420001.json
0	3	So, I've been thinking... The soldiers at\nFort O'Virbus and Keves Castle, they got\nto see Consuls all the time, right?
1	3	Out of all those people, did not\na single one of them get suspicious\nabout what's under those masks?
2	4	They simply trusted them...\nOr perhaps, the concept of distrust\ndidn't ever take root inside them.
3	4	From the moment of birth,\nit's how they were conditioned.\n...Same as us, really.
4	N	Ahhh, so even yer four-eyed man\nhere was young once, eh...?
5	4	Funny. Really funny.\n...No, hang on, I meant\nthe opposite of that.
6	N	Gwahahahaha!
7	5	I'm kinda used to seeing\nTriton's naked face, now...
8	N	Heheh... Classy and understated, no?
9	6	...What do those words mean?
10	N	Oops, my bad. Ye lasses and lads are too\nyoung to understand, I reckon. You'll get it\nin fifty years, want to or not! Hahahaha!
11	3	I don't think I'll ever understand\nMoebius, even if I lived to a hundred...
evt/ask/msg_ask420002.json
0	1	First it was Agnus, and now we've\nmanaged to destroy Keves Castle's\nFlame Clock too.
1	3	Slow and steady progress, innit!\n...Sounds weird coming from me, I know.
2	6	There's all different sides to\nthe power of Ouroboros!
3	4	That's true enough. And yet, there ought\nto have been many in the past who\nbecame Ouroboros and fought Moebius.
4	2	You mean, we only did it\nbecause we're us?
5	4	Yes. I sincerely think so.
6	4	At first I felt uncertain about it, but\nnow I can state it with confidence.
7	4	It's thanks to all of us that we made it this far.\nI'm truly grateful to have had the experience\nof standing shoulder-to-shoulder with you all.
8	2	...
9	3	...
10	6	...
11	4	...Is anyone going to say something?
12	2	Nothing really comes to mind...
13	3	I didn't expect that kind of speech\nfrom *him* of all people...
14	6	I feel a bit embarrassed now...\nIs my face burning? So awkward...!
15	1	Taion, I'd like to return your sentiment.\nYou saved my skin many times over, and\nI don't think I can ever thank you enough.
16	6	Now there's a good follow-up!
17	4	I-I see...\nWhen you put it so bluntly, it makes\none feel a little put on the spot...
18	2	But, Taion...

1	tV	Two hundred thousand G is\nequivalent to how many Tasty Sausage,\nplease?
2	5	Enough that even you'd get sick of 'em.
3	tV	Ohoho! That is astonishing amount!
4	5	More to the point, why would anyone drop\nthat much currency on it? What use even\nis a portrait of K?
5	3	Well, I suppose the City folk\nreally hate the Moebius, sooo...
6	3	...Target practice, maybe?
7	6	Whoa...
evt/ask/msg_ask520002.json
0	6	The Colony Mu salute is different\nthan the way we did it in the rest\nof Agnus, isn't it?
1	3	You mean that whole,\n"Trust your crew, trust yourself,"\nthing they do?
2	6	Yeah, that's the one!
3	5	Good memory, Eunie.
4	3	Heheh! Just wait, it keeps going.
5	3	Ahem... "Trust in victory!\nAll hearts as one!\nWe'll make it! Together!"
6	6	Oooh, check you out, Eunie!\nNicely remembered!
7	3	Yeah, well, it's well and truly stuck\nin my head now. It's really wormed\nits way in there, y'know?
8	6	Hey, hey, why don't we all do it?
9	2	You mean, the Mu salute,\nwith the words and stuff?
10	6	Yeah! I think it's got\na good ring to it!
11	3	Hrrrrm... Yeah, I'm not sure\nI wanna actually do the whole thing...
12	2	I'm fine either way, I guess...?
13	5	Yeah, I'm not doing it.\nIf Fiona caught us, I'd\ndie of embarrassment.
14	4	I will also pass.
15	6	Aww, c'mon you guysss!
16	1	The way things going, the\n"all hearts as one" part might be\na bit of a wash I fear, Sena.
17	6	Man... Shame...
evt/ask/msg_ask520003.json
0	4	It seems that fish pies are\na popular Colony Mu dish.
1	6	Yeah, it looked it...
2	6	...No.\nTaion, please don't tell me...?
3	2	Uh-oh...
4	4	Indeed. I have decided to try and\nprepare a fish pie myself. We should let\nManana have some well-deserved rest.
5	tV	Concern of friend is touching but\nunnecessary! If fish pie is desire of heart,\nthen Manana prepare with gladness!
6	4	Look, I understand your apprehension,\nbut I really want to reassure you.
7	4	Having performed a comprehensive study\nof multiple cuisines, I am confident of my\nability to avoid a mishap like before.
8	6	Mishap?! Disaster, more like!
9	tV	Study cooking and cook cooking\nare two complete different things!
10	4	Not to worry. Provided the data is solid,\nit should be sufficient to follow the steps\nas outlined for the outcome to be assured.
11	4	And therefore, I have prepared the\n20 herbs and 30 spices as required\nby the improved recipe da-

0	1	Tussore and Lotus's ranch\nseems to be booming, huh?
1	2	They even managed to get the\nanimals to breed, leading to the\nbirth of Nandun.
2	1	They're doing so well rearing Armus,\nI wonder what other monsters they\ncould start keeping...
3	3	Me, I'd love a Pippito farm.\nImagine getting to pet them\nany time you wanted!
4	5	Bunnits seem kinda obvious, no?\n...Obviously not the kind with weapons.
5	6	How about Kapibas, or Ottils?\nThey're cute too!
6	2	So we're collecting cute monsters now?\nI guess if we raise them not to fear people,\nit'd be a little oasis of cuddliness...
7	6	...And so the "Monster Ranch" was born!
8	3	Soothing war-weary hearts through\ncontact and play with monsters...
9	3	Yeah, I could see that!
10	4	If it became popular enough, I imagine\nwe could introduce some kind of entry fee\nto monetize this venture.

2	4	Granted, but if we're trying to get close\nto the Moebius unseen, there's really no\nother way.
3	5	For sure. Until Monica gave us these,\nthe Moebius knew every single thing\nwe did almost before we did them.
4	4	The ambushes that awaited us at Colony 4\nand Lambda prove it, yes. ...Well, except\nthat we were safe while in the black fog.
5	3	Sure, but we can't stay hidden\ninside the fog forever.
6	2	Right, we never know when an\nannihilation event might occur...\nIt's too dangerous to risk it.
7	6	Yeahhh, I knowww...\nI'll keep my eyepatch on...

3	4	Or rather, life in the world outside -\nin *our* world - is full of bustle and\nbusyness, perhaps.
4	3	Well, duh, there's a war on out here.\nEvery day's different from the last.

8	5	Deep rest sounds nice and all,\nbut where are we s'posed to find\nthe time to do that in...?
9	XW1	When feeling most busy, is when most\nimportant to carve out peaceful time.\nLife not worth living if always hurrying.
10	1	Wow, that's a painfully insightful remark...
11	2	Maybe the least we can do is make sure\nto take our rest when and where we can\nafford it.
12	XW1	That very advisable.\nAs first step, please to try\nnapping for three days straight.
13	5	You can't be serious, mate...\nWhat are we, Nopon?
14	XW1	Friend Lanz such close-minded...\nThen here is alternative: do some\nstrength conditioning or something.

3	6	Dough?

3	1	In our old world, that's like working from\nour first term, right through to the tenth,\nand then some...
4	6	That must've taken incredible willpower...
5	4	The people of the City have fought\nagainst Moebius for years and months\nbeyond accounting.
6	4	The resilience fostered by enduring\nsuch strain must be what helped them\nsurvive.
7	3	Makes a kind of sense...\nGuess there's a lesson there\nwe could bear to learn too.
8	5	It goes to show, they know a thing\nor two about sacrifice too. We've still\ngot a ways to go, haven't we?

7	Q	Eh, I'm not tryna make it sound like some\nkinda sob story, mind. They've gotten me\nout of a tight spot more'n once.

0	3	Apparently the Lost Numbers can use\nall different kinds of Blades, just like us.
1	4	Monica did say that the City's people\nwere originally of one kind with the\nOuroboros.
2	1	So you'd say that explains the similarity\nwith us? Yeah, OK, I can see that.
3	4	Even so though, it's not many people\nthat can master fighting with multiple\nBlade forms, it seems.
4	3	If you don't commit, your form's gonna be\nsloppy and you'll get bad habits... I think\nI'll always prefer using what I'm good at.
5	4	I like to get at least a basic understanding\nof all of them. Nothing beats flexibility on\nthe battlefield.
6	6	Me, I'm a power girl through and through!
7	5	What the spark's a "power girl"...?\nAh, never mind, I caught your drift.

0	3	So those clothes we'd, uh, "borrowed"\nall that time ago, I guess they were\nCity-made in the first place?
1	6	Huh, thinking about it...\nDoes that mean we might see people\nwith the same outfits, walking around...?
2	1	...W-wait. You don't think...?\nMy style, it's not...weird\nor anything, right?
3	4	Hm, I wonder... We did get dressed\nin a hurry, then. There wasn't time to\nthink about style too carefully.
4	4	Judging from the City people's perspective,\nit's not impossible that something about the\nensemble might appear extremely offensive.
5	1	Oh no...! This is what I was afraid of!
6	3	You look fine, Noah. Don't let\nTaion's mutterings get you down.
7	6	Say, what about Taion's clothes, then?
8	4	I need my attire to be functional, that's it.\nIt's entirely pointless to worry solely about\nits appearance.
9	1	Wow, that's pretty sensible, actually.\nA very "Taion" approach.
10	3	While we're on the subject, Taion.\nThere's something I've wanted to say\nfor a while now.
11	4	What is it?

1	2	Not "smaller folks", Eunie.\nThe word's "children".
2	1	I saw adults reading books to children.\nIt was a really peaceful scene, somehow.
3	5	Yeah... I remember in our old training\nand lectures, they'd basically beat stuff\ninto us. Nothing so relaxed as this!
4	4	I imagine Monica would say this\nis how things are meant to be.
5	2	She'd have a point. I can't really imagine\nthose children holding weapons, fighting\nfor their lives...
6	6	Before Monica became an adult,\ndo you think Guernica read to her\nlike that too?
7	1	I guess...he might have?
8	5	...Strange, isn't it?\nI can't picture it at all.
9	3	Yeahhh... Bit outlandish, innit...
evt/ask/msg_ask710010.json
0	3	OK, OK, let's lay it out once and for all...\nHouse Ortiz works together with Monica's\nfamily, the Vandhams...
1	2	And opposed to them are the Doyles,\npeople call them the "conservatives".
2	1	And keeping the middle ground\nbetween them is House...Rhodes?\nIs that right?
3	3	Man, City politics are confusing\nas all get-out...
4	5	And why're they opposing each other\nin the first place? They're all City people,\nain't they?
5	4	The more people in a community,\nthe more opportunity for ideological\ndivides. I think this is one of those.
6	4	Though they share a common goal, they\ndisagree on the best way to achieve it.\n...I have some experience with that.
7	3	There's bound to be some story behind the\nstory, one that we don't know. It's always\nsomething like that...
8	1	Indeed. We should tread carefully\nwhenever we have to deal with them.
9	4	That does seem prudent. If we misstep,\nwe might become embroiled in the conflict\nas well.
10	6	I still hope one day everyone can\nwork together as one... Is that naive...?
evt/ask/msg_ask710016.json
0	1	Is it true that people have been\ngoing mad for Stefaan's painting?
1	3	I've heard that too.\nApparently the City set love it.
2	5	Seriously? Ugh, ridiculous. I can get behind\nFiona's, but a Moebius's? *K*'s?
3	5	Like, if they were using it for\ntarget practice? Sure, fine, whatever,\nfill your boots, but this?
4	4	Setting aside the fact that it depicts\na Moebius, the City puts value in the work.\nThey're calling it a masterpiece.
5	6	I know the painting's not *him*,\nbut it still has this, uh, I dunno...\nA *presence*. It's uncanny...
6	4	Indeed. When real mastery of the art is\ndeployed, even an uninitiated eye can tell.\nThat must be why it's so highly praised.
7	4	To put it another way...\n"Hate the Moebius, not the art."
8	3	...I don't think that's a saying, love.
evt/ask/msg_ask710018.json
0	6	Looks like the City's welcomed the\nColony 15 refugees with open arms.\nIsn't that amazing?
1	5	They're surprisingly adaptable, them lot.\nI was sure they'd cause all sorts\nof trouble, given half a chance...
2	4	What do you call what's already\nhappened, if not trouble?
3	1	Guess we should be glad\nthe City folk are so understanding.
4	3	Ah, well, it might help that they\nweren't super antagonistic to\nbegin with.
5	6	Yeah, and it doesn't seem like they\neven really think much in terms of\nfriend-or-foe, allies, enemies, all that.
6	6	It's almost like not thinking about stuff\nmakes it easier to make friends...?
7	4	There might be something to that.\nAdmittedly, it's a hard notion to put into\npractice under regular circumstances...
8	3	...Huh, are we saying the Colony 15 lot's\nsecretly kinda awesome?
9	4	As the first Kevesi colony to ever interact\nwith the City, you can certainly call them\ntrailblazers without a hint of irony.
10	5	OK, just don't say that where they can\nhear you, yeah? Knowing them, they'd\nget even more insufferable...

1		It's not inside the Castle.
2		O...K...
3		So that puts it at...
4		Gardin Defense Base?
5		Gardin Defense Base?
6		Gardin what now?
7		It's a guard outpost at the Castle rear.
8		They bring new recruits there too, for basic training.
9		Well, phew!
10		You had me worried there for a second.\nThought we'd be back in the Antol's jaws...
11		Even so, it's an enemy base.
12		We can't expect to just waltz in without a fight.
13		First, let's just try to scope it out.
evt/cq/msg_cq010150.json
0		So, it's beyond this bridge...?
1		Yeah.
2		No chance from the front, not like this.
3		[ML:undisp ](acknowledgment while deep in thought)
4		We can go across those islands.
5		That way...we should be able to\nswing round the back.
6		Then...it's in and out, fast as we can.
7		Yeah. We go in, we get the shard,\nand we hightail it outta there.
8		Right.
9		I can't see another way...\nLet's do it.

5		Hmm?

evt/cq/msg_cq010400.json
0		This is unsettling.
1		Not a single person anywhere in sight.
2		What's goin' on?
3		Is this...'cause we busted up\nthe Annihilator?
4		No, I very much doubt it.
5		We didn't do any direct damage\nto the Castle itself.
6		Maybe it's because of the\nmachiney Queeny?
7		Even so, we didn't actually free\nthe soldiers here, right?
8		And yet no one's here.
9		Huh?
10		The shard's changing position!
11		Hey, Noah!
12		Look at this.
13		Noah?
14		It's a song.
15		What song?
16		You're right.
17		It's a Kevesi one. The melody...
18		Yeah.
19		And it's not just any melody.
20		I know who's playing.
21		Crys...
22		Wait, Crys...?
23		Wasn't that the guy who was\nNoah's off-seeing instructor?
24		Yeah...
25		Huh? But, Crys is...
26		Yeah.
27		He died. Four years ago.
28		Does that mean...he's been reborn, like Ethel?
29		No...
30		I don't think that's it.
31		What then...like Moebius?
32		[ML:undisp ](worried rasp)
33		There are two types of Moebius.
34		The kind like Z and X...who were\nMoebius from the beginning...
35		and humans...who became Moebius...\nlike N, M and Joran.
36		[ML:undisp ](small breath, surprise)
37		S-so...
38		Is this like, a trap?
39		Probably.
40		But the Origin metal readout is real.\nIt's definitely here.
41		In we go?
42		Yeah. In we go.
43		Wha-? Into the jaws?!
44		They're clearly aware that we're coming.
45		But there's no one around.
46		He's waiting. For me...

1		I knew it. Crys.
2		Thank goodness.
3		I'm so happy to see that\nyou're still an off-seer.
4		Crys! Come out!
5		Reveal yourself!
6		I'm waiting in the throne room.
7		Take your time.
8		I want you to come up here.
9		Then I want you to play...
10		that special melody.
11		Crys!
12		I'll be waiting.
evt/cq/msg_cq010600.json
0		I first met Crys...on the\nday of a Homecoming.
1		I remember.
2		A short time later,\nI put in to become an off-seer.
3		And then...we met again.
evt/cq/msg_cq010700.json
0		The name's Noah, right?
1		I'm Crys. Starting today, I'll be your\npersonal tutor. All right?
2		Let's begin.
3		Hey, Crys? Tell me something.
4		Back then on that day,\nwhy did you look so sad?
5		Which day?
6		The day of Homecoming.\nIn Colony 14.
7		Ahh.
8		I see. So that's how I looked to you then.
9		The others looked so happy.
10		And the soldier, he was so pleased about it.
11		But not you.
12		I think...
13		he probably felt content.
14		Content?
15		He had lived through it all.
16		Fought hard.
17		And in serving his Colony,
18		he found purpose.
19		I find...it's quite a tragic thing.
20		But why? I mean, it was time\nfor him to return Home.
21		What do you think that entails?
22		Huh?
23		Reaching your life's expiry date?
24		Surviving through so many battles?
25		Well, I...
26		Do you honestly believe...he was happy\nto disappear for such trivial reasons?
27		That his smile belied no doubt?
28		To me,
29		he looked ready to cry.
30		Huh...
31		Being unable to choose his end,
32		merely accepting what comes next.
33		Crys...
34		There's no joy in a contrived death,
35		Noah.

0		Contrived death, huh.
1		At this point, I get him.
2		Kind of, at least.
3		On that day...he shook my belief.
4		Was I really content?
5		Content with the path I'd chosen to follow?
6		[ML:undisp ](worried breath)
7		And then he chose for himself.
8		His end...would be by his design.
9		I need to know.
10		What was he thinking back then?
11		And why now?\nWhy has he appeared before me?
evt/cq/msg_cq010900.json

2		You dare to appear before me once again.
3		Do you not value your lives? Such idiocy.

5		But you leave me no choice.

18		Let me hear it...Noah.
19		I want...a true melody.
evt/cq/msg_cq011000.json
0		Why, Crys?
1		Why become Moebius?
2		Tell me... What would possess you to side with them?
3		So I could see you again...Noah.
4		But why?
5		Your sworn mission is to change\nthis world, is it not?
6		Yes.
7		And is that because you're\nunhappy with the way it is?
8		It's wrong, and we have to correct it.
9		That is all.
10		I see...
11		So relentless desire...is what drives you.
12		Desire?
13		You fight for betterment.
14		For ever greater aspirations.
15		And what's wrong with that?
16		Nothing at all.
17		It's human nature, after all.
18		But you still don't understand.
19		There's something you must learn.
20		What's that?
21		To be content...with one's lot.
22		What do you mean?
23		Don't you see? Only the strong can ever hope\nto reach the fabled horizon that you seek.
24		Your words must be backed up\nby strength in equal measure.
25		Winners' logic.
26		But birds... What can they possibly know\nof how a lowly worm feels?!
27		Then...what would you have\nbecome of the weak?
28		Would you abandon them?
29		You would refute their everything?\nEnd their story there?
30		Moebius are the ones doing that!
31		Noah... What you're trying to achieve\nhere amounts to the same thing.
32		You really think freeing Origin will revive\nthe world and solve all of our problems?
33		You must surely have heard from the Queen of Agnus.
34		The truth of this world.
35		So what then? You're saying the Queen's lying?
36		No... Surely not.
37		Then what?!
38		But there is no guarantee.
39		[ML:undisp ](worried breath)
40		If...
41		If the Queen is wrong, and the world\nis not created anew...
42		what happens then?
43		Huh?
44		What if this is some flight of fancy?
45		What if you've been taken in,\nstaking your lives, on a whim?
46		Who's accountable? I ask you that.
47		Um... Well, I...
48		I think...
49		it's still the right thing to do.
50		Oh?
51		It was your smile...Crys.
52		I get it now.
53		I know why you were smiling back then.
54		"I'm good here."
55		I get what you meant now.
56		You asked me once...if I would keep moving.
57		And my answer...
58		Tell me, Noah.
59		I will. To the end.
60		So that I can treasure those final moments...
61		Final?
62		When that hour is upon me...\nI want to look back and smile...
63		Then I'll be..."good".
64		Huh?
65		And to come out smiling...we all have to\nchoose where our lives take us.
66		For our future selves.
67		And yet...lack of choice is\nenough to break a person.
68		They struggle, suffer...\nclawing their way through endless fog.
69		A world without choice... That's wrong.
70		If death is a lie in this world,
71		it deserves to end.
72		So you'd rather perish along with the world.
73		I just...
74		I just want to cut this world\nfree from Moebius.
75		Whatever the consequences?
76		Yeah.
77		Otherwise...the Queen would never\nhave told us the things she did.
78		We take everything as it comes.
79		And we're afforded so little.
80		Still... No matter how slim a chance\nwe might have, it's a chance.
81		So if that's an option we can take...
82		Then I'll take it!
83		Noah.
84		Your melody... I hear it loud and clear.
85		Now show it to me.
86		Your conviction...
87		and your smile!
evt/cq/msg_cq011100.json
0		It's...
1		a beautiful song...Noah.
2		[ML:undisp ](holding back tears)
3		Noah...
4		The one who made me Moebius...
5		...was Z.
6		[ML:undisp ](shocked gasp)
7		And it wasn't just me.
8		J too. And N...and M...
9		All of us were human once,
10		and Z changed our very being.
11		Why? Why would he do that to you?
12		For that...you'd be best off\nasking Z himself.
13		But listen...Noah.
14		I think in the end, I was happy...\nto have become Moebius.
15		How could I not be...
16		after hearing such a wonderful song.
17		Crys...
18		Moebius are...an entity bound\nby the confines of this world.
19		Strong...yet somehow fragile...
20		And in their fragility...they crave only the "now".
21		Fearing to tread even a single step\ntowards the future...
22		[ML:undisp ](realization)
23		I chose...
24		the path of the off-seer...because I had a thought.
25		The sender, and the ones being sent...
26		I wanted to learn exactly what it was...\nthat connected them.
27		Though we may be forgotten...\nour feelings live on.
28		It is through our melodies\nthat we carry them on.
29		I think...I once told you something...\nto that effect?
30		Yeah.
31		There's a place doing just that:
32		The City.
33		The City is?
34		The many lives born of the City...
35		Lives, whose existence was never\nrecorded in Origin...
36		They are our future.
37		They themselves are proof of\nthe coming winds of change.
38		I think...I see...
39		They are...
40		our hope.
41		Just as you once were,
42		they too are the product\nof Ouroboros's will.
43		And that...is something\nthat can never die.
44		Crys...
45		You knew everything all along...
46		[ML:undisp ](deep sigh)
47		Noah... One last thing.
48		Aren't you gonna...?
49		You really...do play the most\nbeautiful tune...
50		Go now, Noah.

52		for all to hear...

2		Hm?
3		So those things Crys said...\nWhat was that all about?
4		Finding value.
5		What now?
6		Crys... When he played his off-seer song,\nhe conveyed his wish to me.
7		His wish...that I would come\nto find value in all things.
8		He entrusted it all to you, Noah.
9		Ergo...
10		The rest is history.
11		Yeah.
12		But it's so...
13		Sad, isn't it?
14		I'm going. For sure.

12		Yeah, our side didn't know about it either.

14		They go up to Psi.

16		Hey now...don't go lumping me in with Lanz.\nI took my education seriously.
17		Ah, shaddap. Don't flatter yourself!
18		Colony Omega was...an independent entity.
19		It never engaged.
20		The name it used was Agnian, but even that...
21		wasn't the whole truth.
22		Omega's administrator...
23		was the Moebius Y.

46		I could...be wrong...
47		No, you're spot on.
48		Good call, Sena! I didn't think of that at all.
49		Really?
50		Ethel and Cammuravi had their lives taken.
51		And in that accident, so were the whole Colony's...
52		Most likely, Y was...running experiments that\ncould potentially prove fatal to us soldiers.
53		And now that the Colony's back...
54		You're thinking...Miyabi's still in there!
55		Yeah.
56		That's why I have to go...
57		To end this. He's toyed with our lives\nas he pleases for long enough!
58		...Exactly.
59		I'm with you!\nLet me go too!
60		We're all going, I thought?
61		...Right?
62		Yeah. Obviously.
63		Let's go, Mio.

25		The revenants neither remember nor feel.
26		Only...the instinct...to fight tooth\nand nail for survival.
27		Normally, they would undergo basic conditioning\nin a cradle prior to being awoken.
28		As you all once did...
29		They would fight for ten years,\nbefore returning to Her Majesty.
30		What a piece of work...
31		These younglings...\nThey live for the sole purpose of battle.
32		They are just...as you are.
33		You're full of it!
34		Our memories and feelings, they\ndefine us. They dictate who we are!
35		When you take all of that away-
36		'Tis a phantasm.
37		Fundamentally...memories and feelings
38		are but tacked-on extras, an afterthought.
39		"Tacked-on"?
40		Cut the crap!
41		Oh, they are as sheep.
42		You are simply deceiving yourselves,\nwishing to divine some meaning
43		from something that is devoid of it.
44		Urgh...
45		Why are you doing this?
46		What's your goal?!
47		Merely the betterment of life for Moebius.
48		What?
49		For such is Z's humble desire...
50		Z...!
51		It is Z who wove the fabric of this world.
52		Consequently, we who are his avatars
53		enjoy powers beyond mortal ken.
54		Moebius are Z's..."avatars"?
55		The gift I was imparted...\nis the creation of Flame Clocks.
56		Must I say more?
57		I hold the life of every soldier
58		in the very palm of my hand!
59		[ML:undisp ](appalled gasp/grunt)
60		Indeed, the Flame Clocks...\nThey are part of my very being!
61		Ethel and Cammuravi's Flame Clocks...\nThose were some of my finest work.
62		Did they not thrill you?
63		The ebb and flow of their lives...!
64		Ahhhh...
65		Then did it strike me...
66		Like unto a flame, human life also doth glow and\nglimmer brightest just afore it is quenched.
67		And hence...
68		There can be no greater nourishment!
69		[ML:undisp ](aggravated grunt)
70		Indeed...
71		This Flame Clock is therefore my proudest creation.
72		The final year, when life is at its most dazzling!

74		'Tis a Flame Clock most radiant!
75		Final year...?
76		So that's it!
77		Mwamba and Cammuravi... You brought\nthem back close to their Homecoming!
78		Y...!
79		This is all kinds of screwed up...
80		I've never met anyone I wanted to punch more...!
81		Yeah... Even for Moebius, he takes the biscuit!
82		What is the matter?
83		Proceed with the killing!
84		Let your function be fulfilled, and kill!
85		And I shall raise you up\nas many times as needed!
86		With my Flame Clock ablaze!

2		Cammuravi too.
3		The last time we fought, he was in a Ferronis,
4		but he seems to be even more driven\nthis time round!
5		Sparks!
6		Is this their fight or flight instinct...?
7		Poor Miyabi...
8		They're strong, all right...
9		But...that's all they are!
10		Huh?
11		The melody Miyabi used to play?\nIt wasn't like this!
12		There's no way it was ever this sad!
13		So then...
14		Yeah...
15		They're hollow. There's no will\nbehind their actions.
16		It's not our old friends that\nwe're fighting here...
17		It's something else!
18		An astute observation, yes.
19		It is so.
20		Owing to the basic conditioning being lacking,\ntheir psyches are rather unstable.
21		The melody you hear serves to prop them up.
22		An off-seer...conveys peace to their cohorts.
23		They enable them to realize dreams.
24		That is what I focused my efforts on, and iterated!
25		That's wrong! You can't use the off-seers!
26		Au contraire, au contraire!
27		Behold for thyself.
28		The mental instability is assuaged,
29		and their movements adhere\nto the base specifications.
30		Certainly, there is no will behind it,
31		but "will" is an undesired side-effect!
32		Evil...
33		You can't do this...
34		Not to Miyabi... Not to our off-seeing rites...
35		How dare you use them to your own ends!
36		[ML:undisp ](frustrated breath, thinking)
37		That's a good tune.
38		A Crys original?
39		Yeah, I suppose it is.
40		Maybe I'll pinch it as well.
41		You've got your own tunes, Noah.
42		Those are...just as good.
43		Wonderful, I'd say...
44		Really?
45		I only tweaked a few notes in\na score from my previous Colony...
46		It's not the notes that matter...
47		It's the feelings you imbue them with.
48		Feelings?
49		Raw emotion... It resonates.
50		Mio! It's feelings!
51		Feelings?
52		It's the off-seer melody we've been playing.\nWe just need to play it again now.
53		She's an off-seer too.
54		I know for sure it'll reach her!
55		Of course, yeah.\nOur melody, just like always...
56		Yeah.
57		Understood!\nI'm taking the lead. You follow!
58		Noah, Mio, what're you-?!
59		Wow, good thinking, you two.

4		Though we're not getting any provisions from home,\nso our supply guys are being run ragged.
5		Any requests for us?
6		I don't imagine you called just to shoot the breeze.
7		\\[Haha, no.\\]
8		\\[Good point. Got a bit of info to share with you.\\]
9		Yeah?
10		\\[Specifically, it's about Colony 5.\\]
11		Colony 5...
12		I think...I remember something about\nthem being pretty highly ranked.
13		Yeah. We only happened to hear by chance,
14		but apparently, they made Gold just the other day.
15		\\[Or so it seems, but we're not sure.\\]
16		Oh? Go on.
17		Last time a colony went Gold?\nThink it was about forty years ago.
18		When you go Gold, you're pardoned from fighting.
19		That's why everybody busts their balls\ntrying to rank up.
20		That sounds...pretty familiar.
21		Thing is...
22		We're not even hearing a peep about this\nfrom the other colonies.
23		It's as if...they're acting like Colony 5\nnever existed to start with.
24		\\[I've tried getting in direct contact with them,\nbut I haven't heard a fart back.\\]
25		You think something happened?
26		\\[Well, the woman in charge of Colony 5, Orsolya,\nwas close friends with our commander.\\]
27		With Ethel?
28		To give you some background, some two years after\nthe commander got us to Silver,
29		Orsolya managed it as well.
30		Cammuravi might have been Ethel's rival,
31		but Orsolya and Ethel... They were sworn friends.
32		What, so...if it wasn't for the thing with Cammuravi,
33		you all would have made it to Gold rank?
34		\\[Eh. I guess you could say it was likely.\\]
35		Then...I can see why you'd be worried.
36		Yup. So I was thinking of going to take a look.
37		Been six days since we lost contact.
38		If there's been some accident,\nwe could still be able to help.
39		Are you sure that's a good idea?
40		You got no Flame Clocks!
41		What if you end up like us?
42		We'll get the spark out of\nthere before that happens.
43		But I'm talking about Orsolya here.\nI ain't just gonna leave her.
44		And if the commander was here\nshe'd do the exact same thing.

42		Before we do, we should escort\nthese guys somewhere safe.
43		Some of them are wounded.
44		Ah, too true.
45		Definitely don't want them in combat.
46		How about the cave entrance?
47		They'll be as safe as Castles.
48		Cave entrance, huh?
49		Yeah, that'll work.
50		I, um...\nWe owe you.

7		Well, he's just some underling so\nI don't actually care.
8		Anyway, I count myself lucky!
9		I mean, you popping up while we render judgment!
10		A judgment, is it?
11		Oh? Did they actually work it out?
12		"Work it out"?
13		Oh, what, you didn't?
14		Way to get my hopes up...
15		I thought you came because you worked\nout what's going on with the colony ranks.
16		With the ranks?
17		Yes. The ranks.
18		You've been so desperate to raise them.
19		Just for a bit of comfort,
20		you snatched away the lives of your enemies.
21		Are you gonna get to your point? Come on!
22		Uuugh!
23		Are you some kind of idiot?
24		I mean I've laid it all out for you!
25		Just think a minute, it'll come to you!
26		Snuff off!
27		[ML:undisp ](sigh)
28		I'll make it so you dopes can understand.\nAre you ready?
29		Taking notes? It was us who\nmade up all the colony ranks.
30		Good old Moebius.
31		[ML:undisp ](shock)
32		[ML:undisp ](shock)
33		First we have the lowly Dirt,\nthen there's Tin.
34		Tins go up to Copper.
35		Then you get Iron.
36		After that comes Steel.
37		Then you get the badass Silver.
38		And finally...
39		you've hit the top, Gold.
40		You've been falling over each other,
41		trying to kill each other day by day.
42		[ML:undisp ]Hmph...
43		But why?!
44		What did you even make the ranks for?!
45		Because...
46		What else is gonna motivate you? Eh?
47		What?
48		You humans... You need some kind\nof goal in your little lives.
49		You want to give your Blades an upgrade,
50		you want to eat some nice food...
51		...or you want to live longer.
52		You evil...
53		All we did was give you those goals.
54		And while you're trying to rise up,\nyour life force grows brighter! So shiny!
55		Isn't it wonderful?
56		But then, once you've reached the top,
57		there's nowhere to go but down.
58		And that's no good, is it?
59		Then it's harvest time.
60		One last gasp of defiance...!
61		Then we take what's stored up at your life's end.
62		So then...you're saying the Gold rank's\nnothing but a sham?
63		I just told you, it's to motivate you.
64		Oh yeah, you motivated us real good...
65		You've forced us to fight...\nwithout ever knowing the truth...!
66		Huh? What are you even-?!
67		You've done a good job tearing\nthe place up yourselves!
68		Nobody's ever forced you to do anything.
69		You guys, you like a spot of murder as much as anyone!
70		There's nothing to like about it!
71		How could anyone like it?
72		We live in fear, knowing nothing but fighting...
73		We wanted to reach Gold...\nso we wouldn't have to fight...
74		But you...
75		You took even that from us!
76		Because you're idiots, surely?
77		Just think about it real hard for one second.
78		Who gave up the right to think\nfor themselves? You did.
79		What a load of crap!
80		You're the ones who never left us\nany room to think about our actions!
81		You haven't got two neurons in your heads.
82		All you have are the things we gave you,
83		and you have the gall to complain? (blows a raspberry)
84		Arsehole...! You ain't gettin' away with this!
85		How can our lives mean so snuffin' little to you?!
86		Eunie.
87		She just goading Eunie to make feathers ruffled.
88		Keep head frosty!
89		But she's...
90		False. She scared of Ouroboros.
91		She want mistake-making so she\ncan give friend the finisher!
92		You think she's...scared?
93		You... Smart cookie, aren't you?
94		I was told...Nopon aren't supposed to\ninterfere. Maybe they were wrong.
95		Well, whatever.
96		It messes up my plans just a little,
97		but I think it's about harvest time.
98		I'll take...every last spark!

4		I ain't doin' this because I like it.
5		I'm just doing this to survive.
6		You don't change.
7		You're still just a grunt.
8		You're desperate to kill,\njust 'cause you're afraid of dying.
9		That's where you're wrong.
10		This...isn't just for me any more.
11		A lot of people's hopes...are riding on this!
12		So now, I ain't afraid.
13		I'll carry these hopes as far as I can,
14		until we've made the world how it should be!
15		Oh?\nWell said.
16		All right. How far can you take this?\nGuess I'll wait and see.

6		As long as we live, all we can do is fight on.
7		That's not going to change.
8		You're saying there's no escape?
9		Depends how you look at it.
10		Sourcing ingredients and growing crops...\nYou'd call doing those things a struggle, wouldn't you?
11		[ML:undisp ](chuckle)
12		You say some weird stuff.
13		Fight, struggle, they're just words.
14		And what's important, is not the words. It's what you do.

16		What's inside's the most important thing.
17		You know, I think I'm starting to get it.
18		I've got you, Ethel,

20		So...you're not afraid any more, then.
21		We're the same as everyone else.

24		And still...you'll go on?

1	5	Just look at it...\nThe sea just seems to go on forever...
2	6	If we were still in Colony Gamma,\nwe'd never have ended up coming here...
3	3	Don't think we would've either, eh, Noah?

15	40300	Yes, understood. We'll be there.
16	408A0	All right.\nSee you later then, Taion.
17	3	What'd he say?
18	4	That we should meet him at Lambda\nwhenever we have time...

0		What's this?
1		This was Nimue's.
2		A lens.
3		A membrane, covering an Iris.
4		Nimue...used this?
5		Yeah.
evt/cq/msg_cq040200.json
0		It must have been five years ago.
1		It was...on an expedition to the Cadensia frontier.
2		However, Kevesi troops attacked at night.\nMy squad was crushed.
3		And I was hurt, bad.
4		The one who nursed me back to health,
5		was Nimue.
6		Theirs was a curious colony.
7		No one ever fought.
8		They'd spend their days tending Saffronias.
9		There used to be a Castle there at one time,
10		but at some point it was\ndestroyed in a great battle,
11		and there it lay in ruins.
12		It was there that I saw some cradles,
13		left over from that time.
14		They looked like they would break at any minute,
15		but still, some were making soldiers.
16		Nimue...
17		she was just one of them.
18		The people there...
19		they were like we are now.
20		They lived free of the Flame Clock's yoke.
evt/cq/msg_cq040300.json
0		Sir, you say they were like us...
1		So perhaps...their colony was freed\nby Ouroboros at some point in the past?
2		Well...
3		I'm not sure.
4		It looked like Nimue and the others had always\nbeen living off the land.
5		Also, they'd been strictly shunning contact\nwith others for generations.
6		Naturally most people there\ngave me the cold shoulder.
7		Before long, I journeyed away from the colony.
8		Along with Nimue.
evt/cq/msg_cq040400.json
0		Nimue left with you?
1		Why, sir?
2		There's a world out there...
3		It'd be nice to see it.
evt/cq/msg_cq040500.json
0		I wondered at her motivations.
1		But I think I see now.
2		Now we don't live under the Flame Clock's yoke,
3		we're more free to consider our emotions.
4		Back then, Nimue had to carefully hide the fact that\nher Iris was unconnected to a Flame Clock.
5		She enlisted a Nopon\nengineer to make the lens.
6		All so she could live among us.
7		And after that,
8		she became the Nimue you know.
9		I never knew you two had such\na connection. Incredible...
10		But, why show me this now?
11		Well.
12		Actually...
evt/cq/msg_cq040600.json
0		What...? The leadership want\nNimue's colony wiped out?!
1		Yeah.
2		We only just heard. A Nopon\nmerchant was able to tip us off.
3		And since Nopon are involved in handling most logistics\nand transportation, the information should be good.
4		So the brass have pinpointed its location?
5		Could be.
6		You don't have to be so cagey, Commander.
7		Cagey?
8		You can tell it to me straight.
9		Am I wrong? You'd like us to\nkeep Nimue's colony safe.
10		But...
11		Isn't that the reason?
12		Why you've told me this whole story...?
13		If you moved to protect the colony, it'd\nput this place in the line of fire.
14		I've heard.
15		Like how, after the Consul's disappearance\nand the loss of the Flame Clock,
16		despite sending a report to HQ,\nyou haven't received a word of reply.
17		Mmm.
18		We reported that it all happened\nwhile we lay there unconscious,
19		which is the unvarnished truth...
20		Yet still nothing.
21		I understand.
22		Let me run it past the others, Commander.

2	6	Oh. Guess so.
3	2	That's not all, I think.
4	6	[ML:undisp ](questioning sound)
5	2	I'm sure he must be scared.

7	3	Is that a bad thing?
8	2	No. I don't think so.
9	2	But... I do understand. How he feels.
10	1	Yeah. I'd definitely hesitate.
11	1	It's not just about himself.
12	4	If I hadn't been so careless...\nthe commander wouldn't\nhave to feel this way...
13	3	You're not still thinking like that, are you?
14	4	N-no, I'm... I'm just...
15	3	You're just what?\nLookin' back all the time\nnever helped nobody.
16	4	Look, I... I know.

9	1	No... I don't think they've\nspotted us just yet.
10	1	This one might have different abilities\nthan that K guy.
11	6	Guess that's a thing.\nBut why have only Levnises?
12	4	I can't fathom what this Moebius\ncan do, but they're about to wipe out\nan allied colony.
13	4	They'd have a fun time\nexplaining that to soldiers.

17		Well. Maybe it's the same with me then.
18		Wait, hang on.
19		Do you reckon the past me was more like her?
20		In what way?
21		Elegant, graceful, refined.
22		Hah, no way.
23		You'll be the same no matter how\nmany times you're reborn.
24		Oh, no! S-sorry!
25		I didn't... What I wanted to say was...
26		I don't...suppose we could change.
27		But you know,
28		some things are different sometimes.
29		[ML:undisp ](mildly surprised breath)
30		'Cause this time round, we're Ouroboros.
31		Things'll be different.
32		We're with you, Taion.
33		Eunie...
34		Heh.
35		I didn't expect encouragement from you.
36		Well, you do make a good cuppa.
37		Hehehe...
38		Hmmm...
evt/cq/msg_cq042000.json
0		At this rate, it's going to be up to us.
1		Can we manage? There's plenty of 'em.
2		No people though.
3		Maybe we can just let rip out here then?
4		I mean, I guess so, but...
5		If we don't, this place is done for.
6		Only one choice left to us.
7		Right.
8		What's that?
evt/cq/msg_cq042100.json
0		Taion, what's up?
1		It's just...this Ferronis.
2		A Flame Clock?!
3		Oh man, and it even works...
4		It's just a flicker, but still...
5		Is it this colony's lifeforce?
6		No... I don't believe so.
7		It's ancient, so it must be\na malfunction or something.
8		Remember the people here\naren't part of the Flame Clock system.
9		You make a good point.
10		I've got it!
11		All of this, it's this thing's fault!
12		Huh? What is?
13		It was really bothering me.
14		This place has been safe all this time.\nWhy is Moebius just now taking notice?
15		This is why.
16		For whatever reason, this decrepit Ferronis\nhas come back online.
17		Huh...
18		That's how they found out?
19		Indeed.
20		After all this time... It's bad luck for the people here.
21		Taion?
22		Riku, do you know much about Ferronises?
23		Silly question.
24		Maintaining Colony 9 Ferronis\nwas one of many jobs of Riku.
25		Oh yeah, right. That sure kept you busy.
26		That's perfect. Then, could you\ntake a look at this?
27		What for?
28		If it still happens to work...we just might save this place.
29		Nope, no way.\nSo what if we get it to work?
30		This thing's fighting days are done!
31		It won't have to fight.
32		We're going to play a little trick.
33		A...trick?
evt/cq/msg_cq042200.json
0	4	How is it?
1	8	Friend was right. Ferronis\ncan still move.
2	8	Drive works, barely. But Riku\nthink it will run.
3	4	Can you repair it?
4	8	If we find several parts...then possible.
5	4	How long do you need?
6	8	Friend telling Riku to hurry?
7	8	Well, mechanicist of Riku's talents\ncan do this in thirty minutes.
8	6	Can we get our hands on these parts\nin time?
9	8	There lots of Ferronis and Levnis wrecks\nsprinkled about here.
10	8	Must be something Riku can use.
11	4	Understood.\nStart making preparations for repairs.
12	4	Let's split up and search\nfor the parts we need.
13	1	Sure. We'll handle it.
evt/cq/msg_cq042300.json

1		Er, not quite.
2		We're, um...
3		Taion, I want to fight too.
4		No way!\nI'm not letting you get mixed up in all this!
5		So you really *are* going to fight.
6		[ML:undisp ]Ah!
7		You could...
8		...get hurt.
9		Uh...!
10		If someone dies,
11		I couldn't take it,
12		sitting here pretending none of that is happening.
13		I understand our chief's feelings...
14		It's thanks to her that we've lived in peace this long.
15		But, there's a war going on in the outside world.
16		There are many...who don't want to see it.
17		Or wish it wasn't happening to them.
18		Yet...you've come to us following your own path.
19		And that is real.
20		It's how the world really is.
21		Nimue...
22		Please...!
23		All right.
24		I'll allow you to watch us, while we're fighting.
25		But - under one condition.
26		That is?
27		When we first came here,
28		it was like an awakening.
29		There are still beautiful places like this in the world.
30		We have to keep this place safe.
31		That's what we're fighting for.
32		Once you've seen how we do things,
33		promise me that you'll protect this place.
34		That fight...belongs to you.
35		My own...fight...
36		Yes.
37		You have a deal, Taion.
38		I'll watch all of you...how you fight.
39		I'll burn it...into here.

0		Riku done!
1		Time to light fire!
2		Brilliant! It worked!
3		H-hey... Was it meant to float away?
4		Yes. It was.
5		Huh?
6		Riku, did you input the coordinates?
7		Of course!
8		Riku fed Ferronis numbers just as directed.
9		What's going on?
10		We've made ourselves a lure.
11		A lure?
12		Now I get it.
13		That thing's gonna...lure in the Moebius and beat it up?
14		They know about this place because\nof that thing's Flame Clock.
15		As such, Moebius are probably watching\nout for that Ferronis.
16		So we'll make the Moebius think that the Ferronis\nsensed their approach? And that it's going to attack?
17		Honestly, I would give it about fifty-fifty.
18		Let's hope this particular Moebius is a complete fool...
19		Anyone remember P?
20		...And then, we can all swoop in\nand rinse this mudder.
21		Gotta love a nice and simple plan!
22		What happens after we beat them?
23		Won't they end up coming back...\nas long as the Ferronis is there?
24		I haven't forgotten about that.
25		I've got a little something in mind.
26		Thank you, Taion.
27		Between us...we'll make it work for sure.
28		And keep the Saffronias safe.

1		Taion!
2		Here we go!
3		Great! This guy really is an idiot.
4		While those Ferronises are busy fighting,\nwe'll move in from behind.
5		We'll hit them where it'll hurt\nthem the most - the Consul.
6		Got it!
evt/cq/msg_cq042600.json
0		Ah! It's you lot...!
1		Wait... This is a trap?!
2		Sorry about that, mate!
3		Turns out you had a bit of a brain fart!

5		Oh - ARRRGGH!!!
6		Impossible! Could I really have been fooled by these peons?!
7		My mighty self?!
8		RIDICULOUS! Not a chance!\nThis just isn't happening!
9		This guy's in serious denial.
10		Anyhow, looks like he's genuinely clueless\nabout Nimue and the others.
11		Promise us you'll turn around and go\nback the way you came,
12		and we will let you go.
13		Give a message to your masters,\nif you even have any.
14		Tell them exactly how you fell into our trap!
15		What?!
16		You think I'm some lowly errand boy?
17		Stuff your messages.\nI'm all about the screaming!
18		And I will enjoy yours before the day is through!\nThat's why I am Moebius!
19		Why are they all so gross?!
20		I will never turn back!\nI will cut through!
21		I will fill this valley with the echoes\nof your dying screams!

5		Then I'll pass.
6		Well, whatever the snuff happened,\nit all went down a treat.
7		If I was a Moebius, I'd at least try to check\nthe situation before going all in...
8		Seriously, what a total dingus.
9		Anyway, we got the best possible outcome.
10		Amazing.
evt/cq/msg_cq042900.json
0		Taion. I saw everything.
1		The way you fought...
2		Do you spend every day battling like this?
3		Gladly...yes.
4		Huh?
5		We need the people of your colony\nto protect this place.
6		It's true, there are times when\nour fight takes a toll on us.
7		But we carry on that fight,\nbecause we have a mission.
8		A mission?
9		The foe we fought today...
10		Moebius, who made this world the\nway it is...
11		We have to take it back from them.
12		We have to make a new world.
13		One without fighting, where you won't\nhave to hide away in fear.
14		Taion...
15		But...sometimes we do need rest.
16		To forget fighting for a time.
17		This place...
18		could be our refuge.
19		I understand.
20		Then we'll protect this land.
21		So that whenever you grow tired of your fight,
22		you can return here to rest.
23		Thank you.
24		Our mission...
25		Huh?
26		If we manage to win,
27		there's someone I want you to meet...someday!

3	3	That's how you toughen up, ain't it?\nNot that I'd wanna sign up, myself.
4	2	Right? Ours wasn't pleasant at all.

7	5	Exactly, yeah. Life was a lot easier\nback when we were new recruits, right?

30		That means...

6		The spark...?
7		You can't do this to us...!
8		Colony 4... Know it?
9		Yeah, I've heard about it...
10		On your map, middle of the Fornis region.
11		The lieutenant there, Bolearis,\nyou can tell him we sent you.
12		Try him. Helps to have a mentor,\nstarting out.
evt/cq/msg_cq051700.json
0		You gave 'em the info.
1		Now they got a choice.
2		Some might take it hard, though.
3		Besides, when we cut through the Flame Clock,
4		it was to protect the City detachment too.
5		There was little else we could do.
6		If we'd meddled even more, it might've come\nright back round to bite us in the bum.
7		We did the right thing by telling them about Colony 4.
8		I think that was the best course of action.
9		[ML:undisp ](unconvinced, slightly dejected breath)
10		Everything they believed came\ncrashing down, just like that.
11		They'll be confused for a while, sure.
12		But they'll figure it out,
13		just the same as you lot did.
14		We might've gotten off lightly.
15		If we hadn't met like we did in that valley,\nwe'd be just as confused as those guys.
16		Luck was on our side.
17		[ML:undisp ](uncertain breath)
18		Speaking of, back then...
19		Wasn't it Lanz who was the most reluctant of us?
20		[ML:undisp ]Tch...
21		Nah, nah, nah...
22		Our big man was just a bit shy to introduce\nhimself in front of new people!
23		Right?
24		Ahh, shaddap.
25		Ohh, yeah he was! I did kinda get the impression\nthat he was embarrassed to speak up!
26		Right? Eh?

6		But then...there's the tallspice sauce as well...

11		How can I...possibly choose?!

13		Huh?

18	20300	Huh, material storage warehouse...?\nThe one that the conservatives held...?
19	204D0	Well deduced. The very same.
20	204D0	According to Garrett, he's not had\nthe time to fetch it, ever since the\nCity shifted location...
21	204D0	But I can't bear just leaving it all there...\nThere's a lot of good stuff, after all.
22	204D0	I wanted to send an Armory down that way,\nbut there's a bunch of monsters around.
23	204D0	I was hoping you could take out\nsome of the ones in that area.
24	10300	Understood.
25	108D0	Thanks in advance.

2		She's not around any more.\nI have to do what I can.

5		Put the gun down.
6		O-OK.

9		It's special.
10		Because it's the name she gave me.

16		Like that warmth we felt would\ngo on throughout their lives.
17		I thought...that might have been\nthe answer we were looking for...
18		It's an illusion.
19		It's a fact of life that the child is born\nof the parent, but that's all it is.
20		So everything that we're trying to achieve,\nis that an illusion too?
21		It's all...just a big lie?
22		Sena...
23		Whether it ends in a lie or not is up to you.
24		We all have to crawl face down in the mud.
25		Believing...we'll come out smiling.
26		Mother...
27		Table's set, by the way.
28		Huh?
29		Let's fill up that tum.
30		Sounds nice... I like it.
31		You think Shania...

34		she'll be fine.

17	Notably, the target's emitting\na considerable amount of ether energy.

19	Investigate and destroy the source of ether.
20	Commander, one question.
21	Go.
22	About this target...\nCan we assume it's from Agnus?
23	We don't know.
24	We haven't been able to confirm,\nbut it seems that they're also gunning for it.
25	This would suggest it should be seen as part of...\na different enemy force.
26	Combat with Agnian troops in the area\nis also expected.
27	Details will be sent to your Iris after deployment.

4	I've finally made it this far.
5	What's up?
6	Well...
7	Thing is... I was thinking, after this op,

9	You never know what'll happen\non the battlefield, right?
10	You can laugh at me, if you want.
11	I ain't laughing, man.
12	We've only been alive this long\nbecause you've always had our backs.
13	Yep. We owe you a ton.
14	Just make sure you get to your\nHomecoming, OK?
15	Lanz, Eunie... You guys...
16	Mwamba.
17	Now not time to relax tear ducts.
18	Let down guard, and you fill\nFlame Clock of someone else.

13	Guess I've gotta give the old fool credit where it's due.
14	Interlink?
15	Well, whatever.
16	That form you just merged into?
17	It's called "Ouroboros".
18	Sear that into yer skulls.
19	Ouroboros?
20	Oh, and...
21	Me, I'm Moebius.
22	We look a bit alike, don't we?
23	When Keves and Agnus come together in unity,
24	you're practically one step away from\nbeing on the same level as us.
25	So we're...
26	one being...?
27	Ehh, to put it bluntly, you're failures.
28	Fact is, the two of us are mortal enemies.
29	Enemies?
30	You got the picture?

51	What plan?
52	You six... You're now Ouroboros.

82	From this moment on,
83	those Moebius bastards are never gonna\nleave you alone.
84	Because now, kids... You share a common destiny.
85	They'll hunt you constantly,\nrelentlessly, without rest.
86	Even so...
87	There's one place that might give you a chance:
88	Swordmarch.
89	The land pierced by a great sword.
90	You gotta find our hope...
91	Our City...
92	It's the only way you're gonna\ndefeat the real enemy...
93	And reclaim what was lost...
94	The way the world, and life...
95	should be.
96	And listen.
97	Don't give up. Ten years?\nYou kids deserve better.

115	We're leaving.
116	Noah, Eunie.
117	What's up?
118	The mission's over. We've got an obligation.\nNeed to report the sitch.
119	As do we.\nTime to withdraw. Mio, Sena.
120	Huh? But-
121	"But", what?
122	Come on, Taion. Don't be rude.
123	It's hardly the time for pleasantries.
124	We lost a great many of our comrades.\nWe have to inform those still in the Colony.
125	And we're any different?
126	If you snuffheads hadn't come charging in...
127	Indeed? Well, why don't we settle this\nhere, right now?
128	Yeah, bring it! I reckon I could go for some payback!
129	Lanz.
130	Yeah?
131	That's enough.
132	What d'ya mean?!
133	There's no point.
134	Seriously?!
135	Before, when she and I transformed,
136	I felt her thoughts...or maybe her memories.
137	There were so many.\nAnd then they were a part of me.
138	There were so many different fragments...\nHard to tell them apart.
139	But even then...I understood.
140	She's...
141	She's lost a lot fighting us...\nKeves took away so much.
142	She's experienced a lot of grief.
143	Transformed...\nYou mean...the big'un?
144	Yeah.
145	...I felt it as well.
146	Your grief... It was like mine.
147	Yeah, well-
148	And in one of those memories...!
149	Mio...
150	Is something that could be our fault.
151	That's what it's like...in war, I suppose.
152	Hm...
153	So, what is plan from here?
154	Sun kind enough to show face,\nbut will hide again if this drag on.
155	True, true! Time is wasting itself.
156	You're right. Let's go.
157	A lot's happened, but that seems best.
158	You made the right decision, Lanz.
159	Sorry. For confusing things.
160	Ahh, don't worry 'bout it.
161	Mio. Shall we leave it at that?
162	Um. Yeah.
163	There you have it.\nI sincerely hope for your safe return.
164	You take care too.
165	Take care not to die in a ditch somewhere, that is.
166	The next time we meet, it will be as enemies.\nDon't forget that.

21	The Cit-?! What are you even...
22	In the eyes of the world at large...\nwe're outlaws now.
23	We can't...go back to the Colony.
24	The soldiers...\nTheir Irises glowed blood red.
25	Just like his did.
26	Right, I remember.
27	This is just conjecture,
28	but what if...those soldiers are\nperceiving us as enemies?
29	Because of the red Irises?
30	Correct.
31	But...what's even up with the Colony?
32	Did that freak do that?
33	How?
34	We don't know the method, but it's\nlogical to think he did something.
35	That's exactly right. That's it.
36	So, instead of going off our separate ways,
37	we stand a better chance...\nif we all work together.
38	Right?
39	I suppose I can't deny that.
40	If we are gonna be running, we might\nas well have some kind of aim, right?
41	People on opposite sides, working together.

43	You're saying we can survive that way?

70	So...the City?
71	Yeah.
72	What did he say? "A land pierced by a great sword"?
73	Oh, right. *That* sword.\nY'know, that massive one, way down south.
74	(Defeat the real enemy,)
75	(and restore the world to order.)

96	OK!

159	So, what's our angle?
160	We have made some distance, but we're\nstill in the colony's search zone.
161	Luckily, we don't have any colonies south of here.
162	And you?
163	We shouldn't have any colonies mobilized either.
164	So we...go south, then?

25	I've told you before, haven't I, D?
26	Bah...
27	The gang's all here again.
28	K... Will you go?
29	If you say I go...
30	I go.
31	Well then...
32	Let us see how far the flow brings them this time...

1	Yaaaaaagh!
2	Huuuuuurgh!
3	Waaaaaugh!
4	Guys... What do you think you're doing?
5	Oh, Taion.\nMorning!
6	Hey! Did we wake you?
7	Honestly, I'm surprised you haven't gone and\nwoken up the whole forsaken continent.
8	So?
9	Oh, this?
10	We reckoned we might be able to do\nthe same as what Noah and Mio did.
11	You reckoned?\nYou mean that Ouroboros thing?
12	Yeah! How badass was that?!
13	We thought if we pulled it off, it'd raise\nour chances of survival a whole bunch!
14	And you think it's that easy?
15	Huh? I mean...
16	I don't mean to burst your bubble here,
17	but don't you think...maybe that power's\nmeant only for them?
18	Yeah, but that Moebius guy...\nHe did refer to "us"...
19	I just thought...
20	You thought maybe you could\ntransform as well?
21	What makes you think it would be\nyou two, anyway?
22	Say it is possible. It could be me and Lanz.
23	It's just...kind of a feeling.
24	Yeah, just a hunch.\nRight?
25	Something wrong?
26	Not at all.
27	Then...I guess...that leaves me with her.
28	(sigh) I envy you, I really do.
29	Aw, what're you moaning about now?
30	Let's drop it.\nI don't want us bickering this early.
31	Especially...not now we seem to be sharing\na common destiny. We happy few.
32	If I didn't know better...\nI'd say you were trying to get us all worked up!
33	Think whatever you want.
34	I think you might be on the mark, though.
35	Oh?
36	We were all there, every one of us.
37	In the same situation.
38	Now hold on...
39	The only difference was...
40	I was set...on protecting Mio.\nProtecting all of you guys.
41	And then, I suddenly\ntransformed.
42	That's it? That's all it took?
43	Yeah.
44	So you can take that form via a\nstrong desire, or emotion?
45	Possibly.
46	Probably too much to ask of Professor Grump here.
47	What, me?
48	Well, who'd you think?
49	And you're any different?
50	What, me?
51	Hah! As if I'm gonna join with you.
52	Eunie...
53	Come on, though!
54	You're not going to manage this overnight.\nNot the way you all are right now.
55	Even so... It can't hurt to have\na little hope, can it?
56	Hrm. I suppose there's logic in that.

0	Hey guys... Could I have a moment?
1	Meh?
2	Hm?
3	Yeah? Wassup?
4	There's something that I forgot to tell you.
5	It about who in charge of din-din duties?
6	No...
7	From now on, I want us to avoid\ncombat as much as possible.
8	So... Keves... Agnus... If either of them\ndecide to put up a fight, don't kill them.
9	OK?
10	Not saying I'm against the idea... But why?
11	Guess it'd suck having to draw on our allies.
12	Do we just knock them out cold or something?
13	Or get them to surrender.
14	How kind of you.
15	Huh?
16	I'm sure our past victims will appreciate that.
17	You little-
18	We don't need to take any more lives.
19	There's...no point.
20	(sigh)
21	There's a reason we met.
22	There has to be.
23	Huh?
24	You think?
25	Back then, if we hadn't met each other,\nwe wouldn't be here like this now.
26	Even though we're being chased...\nby both nations at once...?
27	We get chased, we run. Easy.
28	A smart new decision.
29	We'll keep on running...to that sword.
30	(sigh)
31	Ugh. Talk about bad blood.
32	Just give it time.\nIt's early days!
33	Maybe so...
34	Funny pattern you got there.
35	You can talk.\nYou've got those shiny chest doo-dads.
36	We've...always had these.
37	You know, I've never even thought\nof myself as strange before.
38	So many things...\ntaken for granted...
39	We're pretty different, huh?\nWorlds apart.
40	No one's worlds apart.
41	If anything, we should be questioning\nall that we've thought to be true.
42	Differences...are all a matter of perspective.
43	Hehe... Our skeptic.
44	Hey... Are you always like this?
45	Of course. It's my nature.
46	Hmm...
47	Personally, I think it's easier to\ntake things at face value, you know?
48	Now wouldn't that be nice.
49	Eh? You makin' fun of me?
50	All I said was, it would be nice.
51	Oh-ho, no you don't!
52	You just called me an airhead, you jerk!
53	This is just...\nHow long are you going to drag this out?
54	For as long as I sparking need to!\nUntil you come clean, four-eyes.
55	I can't believe this.\nSomeone shoot me.

4	I could do a triple weld?
5	Sure. Long as the output's stable.
6	Yessir!
7	What's up with the K rounds?\nWe're two caches short!
8	Hope you didn't snuff up the order!
9	I don't know, OK?\nGot a problem, take it up with logistics.
10	We're just a Dirt-rank colony, low as they come.
11	You think the Castle gives a crap?
12	Queen's Oath, this pisses me off.\nWe get better scores than any sparkin' colony out there.
13	Did you know?
14	For Tin-rank field rations,\nI hear they get Ardun meat.
15	Really? And...us mudders?
16	Trust me, you really don't wanna know.
17	(sigh)\nI miss the good old Silver days.
18	Didn't have to rely on rations back then.\nWe had cooks come and serve us right on the front line.
19	Used to get Armu sirloin, we did.
20	Seriously?!
21	Ah- Hey!
22	What now? ...Urk!
23	My own indiscretion...\nhas caused you difficulties.
24	I'm sorry.
25	N-no! We would never...\nOur apologies, Commander Ethel!
26	That was all, uh, just banter!\nBelieve me, we had...no intention of-
27	You enjoyed eating Armu steak, did you?
28	Uh... Yes, I did!\nTastiest food I ever ate!
29	I liked it as well.
30	And I hope we will have it again.
31	So lend me your strength.
32	Ma'am! Yes, ma'am!
33	I don't see what's wrong with Volff, personally.
34	Pfft. That's because you have poor taste.
35	I'm jealous.
36	Well, trade you my taste buds?
37	No, thank you.
38	My mouth'd turn as foul as yours.
39	Hahaha! True that.
40	They cleared out real fast.
41	I hear the attending Consul...\nis a particularly punctual sort of character.
42	Please not another stickler for the rules...
43	Can't be long now.

2	I mean, did they not get the memo\nabout the terrain here?
3	(coughing)
4	Ohh, why is it so insufferably dusty around here?
5	Clearly...the place befits its Dirt-rank status.
6	The rainy season will soon be upon us.
7	I ask your patience, for just this short while.
8	Is that so?
9	Then, leaving aside the issue of cleanliness...
10	Just what is with all this fog?
11	I don't take kindly to my vision\nbeing obfuscated...
12	Oh, forget it.

4	but please don't escalate this.
5	Do I detect some defiance?
6	No, no, that was never my-
7	Relax, girl. I jest.
8	Now then, let's cut the chitchat and talk business.
9	I'd like you to eradicate some vermin for me.
10	Vermin?
11	By your leave, sir, we've detected no movement\nfrom Agnian Ferronises around this area...
12	Not Agnus!
13	People. Soldiers.
14	A band of deserters from both sides.
15	Well, something like that.
16	Agnus and Keves...both?
17	Hah. I think it's best you see for yourself.
18	Hmm?
19	This is expressly at the Queen's behest.
20	Don't foul this up.

3	Silly...
4	I don't know why I still bother to check it\nany more. Not like there'd be updates...
5	...Huh.
6	What is it?
7	An icon just popped up - over your head.
8	Huh?
9	Oh yeah.
10	Now I can see an icon for you as well.
11	When did we unlock a feature like this?
12	I've never noticed it before.
13	Yours seems to be...\nthe only one not locked.
14	Wha-?!
15	Huh?!
16	Ohoho?!
17	He's lit up like a sparkin' lightbulb!
18	I guess there must still...be more to this feature.
19	Hey, that's Mimi's!
20	What in the blazes...?
21	I've never used this kind of Blade before, but all the\ntechniques I can use with it are flashing before my eyes.
22	It's so weird... Not like...we suddenly just\ngained the knowledge out of the blue.
23	But...as if it were always ingrained\ndeep within us. Strange...
24	Aww, doesn't look like I can get Mimi's gear.\nNow that's a shame...
25	Mm... This it?
26	(gasp)
27	How come I got moodyguts's\nand not Noah's, huh?
28	That's what I'd like to know. Your class is the\nonly one I can seem to pick, unfortunately.
29	Whoa...
30	You can lug this thing about without\na power frame? Not bad!
31	Dunno how this is even working,\nbut cool!
32	But is this all part of Ouroboros too?
33	If it gives us more options in battle,\nI'm all for it.
34	Yeah, I wanna take this\nnew Blade out for a spin!
35	From here, we head due south, right?
36	Perfect. We can test them\nout on the road.
evt/ev02/msg_ev02078100.json
0	I felt a lot more nimble there,\nlike the way you usually fight.
1	It looked like second-nature to you.\nIt was crazy.
2	You should have seen yourself!
3	Hehe. I think I could've thrashed you!\nWith a little more practice...
4	Y'know, it's totally bananas...\nOuroboros is bonkers powerful.
5	Right?
6	Ah!
7	The gauge for the locked icon has\nfilled right up!
8	Same here...
9	So, logically, if we gain enough experience by fighting together,\nwe will become able to use each other's classes.
10	That seems to be it.
11	As much as I'd like to experiment...
12	Yeah, I guess we shouldn't stay in one place for too long.
13	Right.
14	Well, better get ourselves down south!
evt/ev02/msg_ev02080100.json
0	Hold it a moment.
1	I have a proposal as to our next route.
2	OK. Shoot.
3	I'll send you the map data.
4	Broadly speaking, it's either east or west.
5	I would suggest we go west.
6	Why's that?
7	The area to the west is under Agnus's control.
8	There is a certain degree of risk,\nas they'll have deployed a number of units...
9	but it's the quickest way to get south.
10	What about the east route?
11	No man's land. None of the colonies\nhave laid claim to it as of yet.
12	However, we'd suffer a significant time loss.
13	Time...versus risk.
14	Wait a sec. We're gonna stir up\nthe Skeeter nest?
15	I only said there was a "degree" of risk.
16	Really, it's not so bad.
17	But Agnian troops are deployed there, yeah?
18	Yes.
19	And we're still gonna go?
20	All I said is that it would be more efficient.
21	Efficient.
22	Well, maybe we do need to be more efficient!
23	Faster is better! We don't wanna be\ndragging our heels forever...right?
24	Hey...
25	I just have to ask... Are you\ntrying to push some agenda?
26	Wha-? No... Certainly not...
27	But you admit the east route\nis the safer option.
28	That's just strange.\nWhy wouldn't you pick the safe way?
29	Because time is of the-
30	Look. There you go again.
31	(sigh) That's not all, though!
32	It's all wasteland to the east.\nThe...the heat! It'll be unbearable!
33	Er... Yeah, you're gonna melt in the sun!
34	I'm fine with your choice.\nBut we need to think about everyone's safety.
35	Noah, what's your take?
36	Me? Uhh...
37	I think...I'd rather take the safe route.
38	As for the heat... We can probably figure something out.
39	There. Four against two.
40	(scoff)
41	Taion... Sena...
42	Please.

18	Here it comes!

21	Even armor of Ferronis\nget sliced to itsy bits!

25	Yeah. It's too strong.
26	Hmmmm...
27	Noah want Lanz and friends to kick buckets?
28	No, what the spark?!
29	Same as letting friends die.
30	No it's not.
31	If friends not fight, cannot survive.
32	Sure, but I don't need to use your sword.
33	Then, why Noah not call Blade?
34	It's not out of choice, I just can't...
35	False! Riku see through like transparent!
36	[ML:undisp ](gasp)

43	What the...
44	All this time...?
45	Huh?
46	[ML:undisp ](guarded breath)
47	If death is not option, should live.
48	Only way is fight like life depends.
49	Thinking of self...alone...is way of coward.
50	Though, Riku know feeling well.
51	I'm afraid...
52	Of fighting, you mean?
53	Of this world.\nIt's so brutal and relentless.
54	And I'm afraid of what...we might...
55	become.
56	Mate...
57	Ohoho! Riku knew Noah was hero material!
58	Huh?
59	It true this sword possess incredible power.
60	Might even rob enemies of many-much lives, yes.
61	But only those who understand nature of\nterror have right to wield...
62	...Eh, quoth masterpon of Riku, anyhaps.
63	[ML:undisp ](worried breath)
64	So, if Noah can call Blade now, can still keep\nLucky Seven, maybe in some kind of disguise.
65	In different words, can turn it into sheath.
66	Sheath...?
67	Can use it in fights like normal.
68	But if ever push come to shove...
69	Time will come when Noah truly\nneed Lucky Seven's strength.
70	Then is only matter of drawing.
71	When I truly need its...strength.
72	Exact.
73	If Noah never lose sight of that feeling,\none day, such time surely come.
74	That is, if I can master it...
75	If fail to master, just give back.
76	Can pick out different one!
77	Ah, right...
78	Please not to feel specially indebted\nto Riku - just take!
79	No need for overthinkings!
80	Hah! OK.
81	I accept your offer.
82	Oh, and...Riku?

24	We know her name! So?
25	So, she helped us out once before!
26	She was strong,

28	She could still help.
29	Noah?

30	That or he just loves his job.
31	He too "by the book"!
32	An airhead - that's what he is.

3	Both sides are gonna have Consuls.\nWhy's that odd?
4	More accurately, not just similar...
5	They're the same.
6	They're the same...?\nAre they really?
7	Our colonies regard each other as enemies.
8	But...if the Consuls giving the\norders are the same, it means...
9	It means...?
10	Hmmm...
11	Come on...\nJust spit it out, man!
12	Are Consuls such a big deal?
13	I thought they were everywhere,\nlike your run-of-the-mill Nopon.
14	Riku refuse to let remark of Eunie slide.
15	Got that right!
16	Nopon are rare species world cannot\nlive without! Protect at all cost!
17	Uhh, leaving Nopon out of this...
18	What's this mean?\nThat these guys are mega suspicious?
19	Yes. I suspect they may be more\ndeeply involved than we thought.
20	Involved how, though? With what?
21	With the reason why we fight...\nWith deciding our fate.
22	Our fate...
23	And the Queens?\nYou think...they're in cahoots?
24	What can you tell us about your Queen?
25	I think we've only laid eyes on her once.
26	Right?
27	Yeah, at the Homecoming, I think.
28	She had long, silver hair...
29	Yup, real dignified.\nProper pretty wings too.
30	Wings? Like yours, Eunie?
31	Sort of... But they were\nmuch more of a shining white.
32	Well, as for *our* Queen...
33	She was really elegant...
34	Refined and graceful.
35	And her ears... They were super long!
36	Up to here!
37	Hmm...
38	Guess that means our Queens\nare different folks all right.
39	The Consuls are...kinda like the Queen's servants, right?
40	The Castle's.
41	Their role...is to convey the Queen's directives to the colonies,\nalong with handling admin and decision-making.
42	So, what? If we explain the deal to the Queen,\nyou think she might actually get the picture, yeah?
43	Pretty much.
44	I don't recommend getting your hopes up.
45	Oh yeah?

49	What?
50	Also... Somehow, that Consul...\nHe became Moebius.

7	That's right. We've fought against him\nwho knows how many times now.
8	Took our share of damage...\nBut then, so did they.
9	One time, one of his Ferronis's knee joints blew clean out.

9	[ML:undisp ](sympathetic breath)

12	Even though it meant having to live day to day...
13	That is why I must prevail.
14	Over him.
15	Huh? But, you're...
16	Free from the yoke of the Flame Clock, yes certainly.
17	However, this is another matter.
18	What is it about, then?
19	Hunger. Pride. Desire. Joy, maybe...
20	It's a little hard to put into words...
21	But something along those lines.
22	I haven't all the time in the world.
23	And my troops understand this full well.
24	For me...
25	well, all of us, really...
26	a rematch with Cammuravi is everything.
27	And that...will give purpose to the remainder of our lives.
28	A purpose...to life...
29	Right, OK...\nOn an emotional level, I could understand.
30	Wow, really?
31	I didn't say I agreed.\nI just see her point of view, that's all.
32	All right now. Let's put a pin\nin the philosophizing.
33	When we talked last night, you said your\ndestination was...Swordmarch, as I recall?
34	Right.
35	Come along.
evt/ev03/msg_ev03080100.json
0	This right here is Swordmarch.
1	Well, that part is common knowledge,\nI suppose.
2	To get there, you have\na few possible routes.
3	Mainly, the northern and the southern.
4	And then, the direct route, cutting through the ocean vortex.
5	You don't say...
6	That works?
7	Nobody's done it before.
8	Such a tease...
9	You can try to approach it from sea or from air,
10	but soon as you're close to it,\nyou'll end up being ripped to shreds.
11	Trust me, it's not just the waves and the wind.
12	We believe there's some other force at play there.
13	And so...
14	Through elimination then, these two.
15	And quite frankly, I wouldn't advise going north.
16	Why's that?
17	The road's dangerous, and it runs right past\nAgnus Castle territory.
18	You'd have a hard time getting through.
19	Taion, turns out you were right!
20	As always.
21	Additionally, you are Ouroboros.
22	If you face another Colony, you may find\nthe same thing happening as did with us.
23	I'd feel safe betting on it.
24	If you go south, the battle lines are\nrelatively fixed.
25	If you can proceed along this route,
26	you'll get there in about two months.
27	Two months...
28	[ML:undisp ](empathetic murmur, picking up Mio's discomfort)
29	But...
30	But? There's more?
31	Even if you reach the Sword...
32	This... "City", yes?
33	It's hard to believe you would find it there.\nIt seems far-fetched.
34	How so...?
35	Once, we had to advance across this region ourselves.\nIt was empty.
36	Nothing but the Sword piercing the landscape.
37	And then... There's that word you mentioned, "City".\nWhat could that possibly mean?
38	Is it a person? Or a thing?
39	When Guernica talked about it,\nit sounded kinda like a colony...?
40	Uh? I was pretty sure it was an object...
41	Will you still go there?
42	Regardless?
43	Yeah...\nThat was the idea.
44	For a chance to live on.

4	At this point, I suppose...\nit just panned out this way.
5	You really think so?
6	That's not really how it looks to me.
7	Well, one thing's for sure.
8	We were sworn enemies once. And yet,\nwe all share the will to live in the now.
9	Before becoming Ouroboros,\nI never realized.
10	But that common will, it was\nreason enough to stick together.
11	I see...
12	Not everyone makes the choice to fight willingly.
13	Lanz said that you "have to".
14	Well, right now every one of us has to.
15	There's no question it would be better\nif they didn't.
16	Your journey may have started out of necessity,

22	You're heading out as well?
23	As soon as we're done here, I'll make for the Castle.
24	What?!
25	You forget, I am the commander.
26	We haven't revolted against our nation, so...\nI have to report in.
27	Ethel, are you sure?
28	Oh, don't worry. I'll be leaving you out of it.
29	That's not it. The Consul earlier turned Moebius.
30	Were it to...
31	If you mean that monster, I'm well aware of the risk.
32	Then why?
33	Because it's my responsibility to those I command.
34	As for the Consul, we can say he died in an accident.
35	[ML:undisp ](relenting breath)
36	And you can't do it remotely?
37	Now that the Consul and Flame Clock are both lost to us,\nI have to make a report, and not over comms.
38	I have to requisition more supplies, too.
39	And what if... What if they fit you with a new Clock?
40	Hah... I can worry about that then.
41	You're fine with it? Really?
42	Don't get preoccupied with us.
43	Keep to your path. Follow it, wherever it may lead you.
44	Life is short.
45	I suppose.
46	Hey. While we're all still here,\none more word of warning.
47	Hm?
48	The Consul was attempting to\nremove you from the picture.
49	In light of that, you'll likely come up\nagainst hostility.
50	But listen. You should keep engagement to a minimum.
51	Keves, or Agnus. That goes for both of them.
52	But... If we break their Clocks,\njust like with Colony 4 here,
53	they would...\nWell, they would be free, wouldn't they?
54	You'd do well to remember not everyone\nthinks the same as I do.
55	Even within this colony,
56	many still haven't come to\naccept their new reality.
57	Ah...
58	To make things even more fraught,
59	in other colonies,
60	there are those who are more than\nwilling to fight...as you'd expect.
61	So it's no use appealing to their sense of compassion\nor hoping they'll treat us fairly, is that it?
62	[ML:undisp ](uncomfortable murmur)
63	Yes, precisely.
64	You will change the fate of others,\njust by virtue of coming into contact with them.
65	It's quite the burden. You may not want the responsibility.
66	A burden...? Perhaps...
67	All that said, you get embers on your coat,\nyou have to brush them off.
68	If push comes to shove, do not flinch.
69	Do whatever it takes. For the greater good.

3	I've never seen one.
4	A real golden Flame Clock...
5	Ain't that strange?
6	We're talkin' Gold rank - the shiny\npinnacle of every Colony's ambition.
7	And this is how we find it?
8	It's, uh...Kevesi, isn't it?
9	Yeah. Has to be.
10	For all that, I'm not seeing any Agnian\ncorpses or weapons.

11	All right then, any suggestions?
12	Oh, er...
13	Come on.
14	Let's see... There should be some\nnearby tunnels we could use.
15	Sounds good to me.\nWe might still get enemies,
16	but underground, at least we won't have to worry\nabout lunking Ferronises and that.
17	Tunnels! Thrill of explore!
18	Riku already on treasure-scent!
19	Ohohohoho!
20	Seems like that's the way to go then.
21	(stutter) One moment.
22	These tunnels have been disused for a long time.\nThere's a very real risk of a cave-in.
23	If it comes down to it, escape options\nmay also be in short supply...
24	Nah, nah, nah.\nYou're the one who came out with it.
25	Unless, you got any other plans?
26	You better not want us to just\ncamp out here forever.
27	No, obviously...
28	All right, let's back it up!
29	Any route we can take will have\nsome attendant risk or other.
30	At this point, I'll settle for any choice\nthat makes our lives easier.
31	Enough with the doom-mongering.
32	Just keep it positive. Things'll work out somehow.
33	Mimi, what's up with you?
34	Sounds like little Miss Senior's\ndecided to pull rank, eh?

22	Quite simple actually.
23	It gives a sense of security. Lets you think your\ndead friends are looking out for you from above.

25	Yeah, OK, but... Ain't there plenty of people\nwho don't care about that?
26	What matters is that it is there.
27	You don't need to pay attention.\nYou don't need to do anything.

29	We are told our life is born from the Queen,\nand to the Queen it returns.

15	So we're one big thorn in their side.
16	Hmm...
17	It does stand to reason that's why we're their targets,\nbut it doesn't tell us anything about why our colonies fight.
18	Any theories?
19	Not as yet.

1	Ending peoples' lives like it doesn't matter.\nUrgh. What a sick joke.
2	There word for people like that.\nKnow what Nopon say?
3	No idea. Tell us?
4	"Supervillainpon".
5	Riku, what does that mean, then?
6	It mean extreme bad guy.
7	Ahh, I think I get it.
8	Meh-meh...?
9	Wassup, Manana?
10	Then, are Noah and Mio and friends...\nsupervillainpon?
11	You're labeling us?
12	Labeling. Because friends used to end lives also!
13	[ML:undisp ](slightly taken aback)
14	That not make them supervillainpon?
15	I mean... It's not like we ever had a choice\nor anything. It was them or us.
16	So when no choice,\nnot fall under definition then?
17	None of us ever fought 'cause we wanted to.
18	It's just how it worked.
19	How people worked, and the world.
20	So...
21	World is supervillainpon!
22	Whuh?
23	Since it make everyone do nasty things!
24	World is bad guy!
25	The world is...bad?
26	Huh, I never thought of it like that.
27	Now that you mention it, what in the world\nare we even here for?
28	I wouldn't strain your brain too much.
29	Sounds like *you* have.
30	What gave you that idea?
31	Cut the snark, just tell me!
32	The end-point of it is...
33	...suicide.
34	Say what?
35	If you don't want to hurt others, you'll end up\ndenying your own right to survive.
36	Eventually, you come to the conclusion that the world\nmay well be better off without your presence.
37	The only resolution then, is to erase the self. To die.
38	See? Pointless.
39	Isn't that taking it too far?
40	The world doesn't just vanish\nbecause you've closed your eyes.
41	What...?
42	The moon...
43	Think about it. Why is it that the moon shines?
44	Just because we're watching?
45	Of course not.
46	Even if humans were gone, it would shine on,\nilluminating the land beneath.
47	And yet... We're the ones\nthat give meaning to it.
48	We say "bit dim tonight," or...\n"Looks brighter than usual, eh?"
49	Similarly, we can now imbue the world\nwith meaning, or change it.
50	It's a privilege we were lucky to obtain.
51	And that's...the power of Ouroboros?
52	We're obliged to use it.\nWe can make a difference.
53	So we don't become supervillains?
54	That's one thing to aim for, at least.
55	Right?

3	Remember, we're up against a Castle.
4	Get too close and we may come under fire.
5	What's our plan?
6	I think we'll be able to manage, as long as we're careful.
7	Come to think of it, you used to go to the Castle\nfor off-seer training once a year, right, Noah?
8	The black fog... Is there much there?
9	There's actually quite a bit.
10	Around this time the whole area\nis shrouded in it.
11	They couldn't find us in that cave\nin Nih'l Valley, right?
12	And you think...we can repeat that?
13	Maybe.
14	Using the fog to approach is clever, but risky...\nWhat if an annihilation event occurs?
15	You know, I hadn't really given it much thought\nup until you mentioned it, but...
16	oddly, it hasn't been happening.
17	Seriously?
18	I'm not sure why.
19	Behind the Castle, there's an ether deposit\nbeing mined, in an area facing a lake.
20	The ether being obtained there is then delivered\ninto the Castle through a freight entrance.
21	So that's where we'll get our sneak on?
22	There won't be anyone in the containers.
23	If we can just get to them,\nwithout being spotted...
24	Then we can get into the Castle.
25	OK, let's assume we do give the guards the slip.\nWhat do we do once we're inside the place?
26	Taion. The sensors. What was the Colony 4 soldiers'\nsearch radius, with the fog out?
27	Their scanning range...I'd put in the ballpark of 15 metri.
28	Look here. In the reserve area, there's a maintenance hatch\nthat leads directly to the outer wall.
29	If we make it through here and get to the main housing...\nIt'll land us in front of the Annihilator.
30	Less chance of being spotted\nby troops outside, too.
31	We can do this.
32	There's one concern.
33	The Castle is the Queen's residence.\nWhat if we're found by the Consuls?
34	Then I guess...we'll have a fight on our hands.
35	But it's not like we don't have a retreat.
36	Here.
37	In Keves, after a Homecoming...
38	They wash away the belongings of the dead,\nas part of a ritual. It's an understated affair.
39	And the channel they use for it...is here.
40	It flows straight out, connecting to\nthe lake outside the Castle.
41	I see...
42	So we open a hatch near the Annihilator, ride the\ncurrent, and we should come out right at the lake.
43	More snuffin' water.
44	Every time we run...why do we always\nend up getting drenched?
45	I mean... Feathers are a bitch to dry.
46	Every time being, our grand total of once.
47	Well, let's just hope we don't have to fight.\nThat's the ideal case.
48	That's it, then.

7	Tomorrow, we'll finally\nreach the Castle lands.
8	I want us to be at our readiest.
9	We should run one final check\nof everyone's equipment.
10	Fine for you, isn't it?

13	We keep taking this at such a casual pace.\nNow Swordmarch...seems so distant.

16	You still have two months left.
17	If we take care of this now,\nwe can ensure the Colonies' safety.

56	You're an off-seer, Noah.\nI thought you were sharper than this.

47	Got to put it into words first?
48	Yeah, but it doesn't always work, even then...
49	Like last night?

11	"Her Majesty" occupies the same\nniche of existence as we do.
12	Hmmm?
evt/ev04/msg_ev04345100.json
0	Just past that gate, we'll find\nthe Colony 11 garrison.
1	Beyond that is a residential zone.\nFrom there, there's a road to the Castle's main gate.
2	Gate penetration would not be easy.
3	Expect huge battle.
4	Yeah.
5	So we'll take a detour through the hovering reefs\nto the right and swing around behind the Castle.
6	That's where we'll find the ether mine\nand freight entrance I mentioned.
7	Understood.
8	We shouldn't be hanging around here for long.\nLet's make for those "reefs", as you called them.
9	Good. This way.
10	Follow me.
evt/ev04/msg_ev04350100.json
0	There it is.
1	Black fog, too. Few enough numbers\nto sneak around.
2	Is Colony 4 gonna be safe, do you think?
3	They should be OK.\nWe haven't seen the light for a while.
4	I think that's a good sign.
5	Let's move. The fact that we killed Consuls\nmust be old news at this point.
6	Could have made examples of a few people by now.
7	They ain't expecting us to sneak aboard, though.\nWe've got 'em with their pants down.
8	Let's get in there, mess 'em up, get out,\nbish bash bosh.
9	Actually...
10	They may have already...anticipated our moves.
11	Nah, mate. Come off it.
12	Think about it... How would they have known where we'd be?
13	Uh...
14	Can't be a coincidence.
15	I mean sure, it could have been intuition on Ethel's part,
16	but we have to be realistic.
17	So it's a trap? You wanna turn back?
18	No...we'll go.
19	We can't turn back now.\nWe can't allow their deaths to have been in vain.
20	So you would entertain the risk?
21	It does sound bad.
22	You know, I think I kind of like it.
evt/ev04/msg_ev04360100.json
0	Looks like you were right, Noah.\nThere's a whole bunch of containers here.
1	A welcome gift for easy sneakings!
2	Let's go over this again.
3	First, we get to those containers without being spotted.
4	With me so far?
5	Anyone spots us, we're like ninjas.\nWe take 'em out quickly and silently.
6	Once we're inside, we pick the right opportunity\nto proceed through the hangar.
7	Our goal...is here.
8	The maintenance hatch, that leads outside.
9	From there we head to outer deck.
10	Right.
11	Enemy presence should be lower around there.\nThen we move to the main housing.
12	Assuming we get there, how do we trash it?
13	I can brief you on the next steps.
14	After analyzing the data we got from Bolearis, I discovered\na flaw in the Annihilator's construction.
15	A weak point?
16	Indeed. Here.
17	The weapon is designed to temporarily render the black fog\ninactive, condense and collect it, then release it in one blast.
18	Our best bet is to destroy the neutralizer\nassembly from which it draws its power,
19	but it's located in the Castle interior.\nGetting there will be no joke.
20	Once there, we'll need to damage the\nauto-balancer in the barrel's housing.
21	Most likely it was built in a hurry. The movable barrel\nis affixed to this outer ring that you see here.
22	But the ring isn't strong enough to take the barrel's\nweight or absorb the recoil.
23	That's why the auto-balancer was added\nafter construction, as an afterthought.
24	So what, we've just gotta smash\nthat thing to pieces?
25	Smash it and the entire ring begins to fall apart,\nand the barrel collapses under its own weight.
26	How strong is the auto-balancer?
27	Not too sturdy?
28	Nothing Ouroboros can't handle.
29	So, what's this thing?
30	That is a refrigeration unit - the barrel\nneeds vast amounts of energy.
31	It would have to be kept cool at all times,\nto keep the energy in check.
32	I'm surprised it's so huge.
33	Seems that was built quickly too.\nIt's got both bulk and heft to it.
34	They probably couldn't have made it any smaller.
35	Hmm. A rush job, huh.
36	OK then. We all good to go?
37	Yeah. No more taking it easy.\nLet's make this happen.
evt/ev04/msg_ev04365100.json
0	So, where's the maintenance hatch?
1	It's in the reserve area on the upper level.
2	First we'll need to take the elevator\nthat can get us up to that floor.
3	I don't see any guards.
4	Too foggy, for taste of Manana.
5	If we're gonna move, now's the time.
6	That said, we are indoors.\nMove fast, but keep your eyes peeled.
7	Yeah, of course.
evt/ev04/msg_ev04370100.json
0	Riku see!
1	There is Annihilator!
2	Bigger than Homecoming pudding!
3	That's huge. Think of the firepower... Two or three colonies\ncould, like, be wiped off the map with one shot of that.
4	We have to hurry!\nIf it starts moving now...
5	If the map is correct, the auto-balancer\nshould be in that housing.
6	That's what we're after, right?
7	Yeah.
evt/ev04/msg_ev04380100.json
0	It looks even bigger, seeing it up close...
1	Noah. That's the auto-balancer.
2	Right. Just like on the map.
3	Well then, let's get to it. Sena!
4	My pleasure!
5	[ML:undisp ](shock)
6	[ML:undisp ](shock)
7	Sorry pals, 'fraid I can't let you do that.
8	You?!
9	'Sup? Been a while, eh?
10	Moebius... How'd you figure it out?
11	You lot aren't too bright, are you?
12	Sure, we can't pinpoint your exact position\ninside all the black fog...
13	but we can get a general idea where you're hanging out.
14	Once we picked up your reading\nnear the Castle, we knew.
15	I mean, what, you were just passing\nthrough, were you?
16	You'd have to be an idiot to think that.
17	Grrr!
18	Eunie? What is it?
19	It's... Nothing.
20	This guy just does my head in, is all.
21	He very condescending.
22	I couldn't agree more.\nLet's shut him up then.
23	[ML:undisp ](Frustrated grunt)
24	Hehehehehehe...
25	[ML:undisp ](shock)
26	Joran... You're here too...
27	[ML:undisp ](menacing laugh)
28	[ML:undisp ](frustration, apprehension)
29	So that's what you look like...
30	Whadda ya think? Quite the looker, eh?
31	I knew it was a trap!
32	I'm not entirely sure I would say "trap" exactly.
33	Eh, you'd have to ask N for the details.
34	N?
35	So you took down P and O, didja?
36	Not bad at all!
37	Good riddance, I say. Idiots.
38	I mean, going past the time limit while Interlinking?\nWho does that?
39	Dumbest thing I've ever heard!
40	So that really was it. The time limit.
41	Well, since you lot have already tangled with them,\nwe can make this quick.
42	I'm just glad I won't have to explain this.
43	Yes. Why even explain?
44	How typical.
45	So? Loads better than P and O, right?
46	Hehehe!
47	Can beat them this time?
48	Won't know until we try!
49	Well, what are we gonna try?!\nJoran's in there, you know?
50	Yeah, I noticed!
51	N-Noah?!
52	No time to think!
53	For Ethel's sake... We have to destroy the Annihilator!
evt/ev04/msg_ev04390100.json
0	Annihilator has started moving!
1	This is bad, Noah!
2	I see it!
3	No you don't!
4	Haa!
5	[ML:undisp ](pained scream)
6	Whatcha slackin' around for?

20	[ML:undisp ]Aaahhh!
21	What's the matter, Eunie?!\nYou're too slow!
22	[ML:undisp ](frightened breathing)
23	Girly.
24	I think we've met before.
25	Wh-what?
26	Heh heh heh... Those eyes!
27	You're afraid, aren't you?
28	Why so scared?
29	[ML:undisp ]Heh heh!
30	I'll kill you whenever you cross my path!
31	[ML:undisp ](terrified gasp)
32	Let me lead! I'll handle this!
33	Go, Mondo!
34	[ML:undisp ]Hah!
35	You're not hittin' me!
36	Hah! Sure about that?
37	What?
38	Bind!

40	We won?!
41	No...
42	What?!
43	[ML:undisp ]Aaagh!
44	Joran...
45	Sorry, I don't think so.
46	You'll have to do something about me first.
47	You'll never win this otherwise.
48	Heh heh heh!
49	[ML:undisp ]Ugh!
50	Well then... We'll just have to take out this!
51	Mimi! You gotta keep them busy!
52	I'll do that!
53	[ML:undisp ]Ahh!
54	What, you thought this was just a fashion choice?
55	These can sense the slightest shifts in the air.
56	Kind of a sensor, really.
57	Even without looking at you,
58	I can tell exactly what you're doing,\nso you brats better learn fast!

84	Hah!
85	Huh?
86	All you're sensing...is the area around you.
87	What's your point?
88	Well, if I make some distance,\nlooks like you can sense...spark all!
89	An illusion?!
90	Just so!
91	Scatter!
92	Son of a-
93	You did that at the start?!

117	I'd say it's likely they got away.
118	That right...?
119	[ML:undisp ](pensive sigh)
120	Eunie... Have you ever met him before?
121	As in before we became Ouroboros, I mean.
122	No idea...
123	But I think that...something inside me remembers.
124	That guy...and his claws...
125	Maybe that has to do with Moebius too.
126	Why they exist here in our world.
127	Well then... I've gotta know, don't I?
128	And then, I'll break free...
129	And it won't have to feel like I'm suffocating...
130	Eunie...
131	We can think more later.\nRight now we should make ourselves scarce.
132	You're right. We might have destroyed the Annihilator,\nbut we haven't liberated the Castle.

1	Maybe this channel...not connect\nto outside Castle?
2	Weird... This wasn't on the map.
3	So where are we at, right now?
4	Somewhere here in the mid-level?
5	It's OK. If we go a bit further,\nwe can get back in the channel.
6	Might as well, then. Let's see where this goes.

5	Wait...
6	Hm?
7	It's the right path, but...
8	We shouldn't be here!
9	What do you mean? Why shouldn't we?
10	Uhh...
11	I should have known!
12	Th-this place.\nI saw an image of it in training.
13	Oh. Oh...
14	Shit, we gotta go!
15	Noah, is this where I think it is?
16	Yeah.
17	The throne room!
18	This not just bad place.
19	This worstest place, heart of enemy base!
20	We haven't been noticed yet.\nLet's get out of here, now!
21	Good idea.
22	What are you doing?! We have to go!
23	Noah, what're you playin' at?! Come on!
24	[ML:undisp ](awed noise)

29	Were we...ever like that?
30	My skin's crawlin'...\nPlease can we leave?
31	All those people... Do you think they're sleeping?
32	Or maybe they're...
33	Wait, is that...?
34	It *is* her!
35	What?
36	Ethel!
37	Huh?!
38	That's crazy.\nHow can it be Ethel?
39	Well, it sure looks like her...\nbut this is definitely a first-termer!
40	No. It really is Ethel.
41	From when we first met her.
42	Yeah. No mistake.
43	What do you mean, when you first met...?
44	What in the...spark...*is* this?!
45	This is what they taught us, right?
46	That our lives are born from the Queen...
47	You are as well?
48	Huh? Same for you guys?
49	We soldiers are born from the Queen, we fight...
50	and then...
51	To the Queen you return.
52	Huh...?

94	We didn't have any choice!
95	No choice?
96	Indeed. I assume then...you had no choice\nbut to collude with our sworn enemy?
97	That's why you've been trying to wipe us out?
98	Both us, and Ethel's Colony 4?!
99	Verily it is said...
100	Ouroboros abhor this world.
101	You must be erased, lest this world be destroyed.
102	We don't "abhor" anything!
103	Do you realize how many battles\nwe've fought and won for Keves?
104	We've served you our whole lives.\nAnd now this bollocks?!
105	Your Majesty! Please!
106	You say you fight for Keves?

119	Unchecked, Ouroboros will lead this world to ruin.
120	Now, by my authority, you shall perish.
121	So...
122	That's it? That's your verdict, then?
123	It is not Her Majesty's "verdict".
124	'Tis the will of the world.
125	It's what?
126	Indeed. The security of this world is paramount!

9	"Uninvited guests", one might say.
10	They're the ones who led us here.

21	[ML:undisp ](breath, mild upset)
22	What's your problem?!

25	These were our Ouroboros candidates.

27	That includes Shania there.
28	Candidates?
29	You happy?\nThat you stole Ouroboros from us?
30	[ML:undisp ](intake of breath)
31	All right, that's enough.
32	Whatever the reason, the old man did choose 'em.
33	To be fair, they have gone against\nquite a few Moebius already.
34	They're the real thing all right.
35	You heard Shania's reports.
36	What reports?
37	I had her monitor your actions\nwith extreme scrutiny.
38	All the way from the valley.
39	Huh?
40	Since way back then...?
41	Heh.
42	Together, we are united in our cause.

1	So is that why? ...Why you stormed the Castle?
2	After the Ouroboros Stone activated,\nShania relayed the info straight back to us.
3	So, I'd been looking for a chance to contact you.
4	Oh, really?
5	We reckoned that you would\njust head straight here...
6	What we did not expect was for you to dive\nstraight into the heart of the enemy's base.
7	Ah...
8	I was flipping out.
9	Your actions were *so* reckless,
10	I started to wonder if our "saviors"
11	were just a buncha ravin' lunatics.\nIt kinda looked that way.
12	That's a little...
13	Too harsh...
14	Heheh, sorry.
15	Poor choice of words.
16	How about "hotheads"?
17	Yeah, that's not a lot better...
18	Still, it helped us complete one of our primary objectives:
19	Securing a number of growth modules.
20	What are those?

1	Cradles!
2	Your so-called "cradles"
3	are the growth modules that birthed you.
4	You were conscripted from birth,\ntrained to kill one another ruthlessly
5	and steal each other's life.
6	That life energy pours into the Flame Clocks,
7	becoming the fuel
8	that feeds Moebius.
9	(shocked gasp)
10	In order for Moebius to exist, they\nmust continue to claim life energy.
11	And these "cradles" right here...\nThey're used to recycle your lives.
12	Ethel...
13	Yeah...
14	You live your lives in servitude\nso that Moebius can exist.
15	And even in death, there's no release.\nYou'll just keep getting recycled.
16	No way...
17	There's your shackles.
18	Soldiers bound by Moebius's shackles\nare destined only for mutual destruction.
19	Those who lose their lives in\nbattle, they're reborn anew...
20	They wake from a Castle cradle, a blank\nslate without a scrap of their former memories.
21	Wait...
22	Then...that husk I saw...
23	But...if we keep your lives bound\nto the bodies, as we're doing here,
24	they're of no use to them.
25	This way we can whittle away at their power...
26	So you've been doing this...\nover and over again, then?
27	That's right.
28	You don't wanna know for how long, believe me.
29	And yet... The price we pay to take\ndown just a handful of Moebius...
30	is immeasurable.

34	What's a "descendant"?

10	Tell us about them.
11	Long, long ago, they gained the power of Ouroboros.\nIt let them match Moebius blow-for-blow.
12	The City folk you see here?\nWe're all descended from them.
13	Bound...by their blood...
14	[ML:undisp ](breath, affirming with nod)
15	It was the Queens... So they say.

18	Although...there can only be\nsix Ouroboros alive at one time.

30	Yesss, real Queens!
31	I knew that soulless piece of clockwork\njunk wasn't the real deal.
32	Does that mean...our Queen is false too?
33	Mm.
34	We're still trying to pinpoint the true Queens.\nThey're out there somewhere, sleeping.
35	What for?
36	Why else?
37	To take our world back from Moebius,\nand set things to rights.
38	The true Queens will help us there.
39	Hang on a bleedin' second.
40	Ouroboros were born, like,\n"generations" ago, right?
41	But you said the Queens are sleeping?
42	Are there humans who can even live that long?
43	Now that, I don't know too much about.
44	Then what *do* you know?
45	Well, the legend goes that
46	both of the Queens, their lifespans are\nsupposed to be incomparably longer than ours.
47	And you're pinning your hopes on that?
48	At the moment, that's about all we can do.
49	All right.
50	So... When the world is "back to rights"... Then what?
51	The people you've seen here?\nThe way they live their lives?
52	That could be everyone.
53	Babies, children, adults, the old...
54	They're all a part of nature's cycle.
55	And that would go...for us too?
56	Umh...
57	There'll be more to life than just fighting to survive.
58	We'll weave the tale...that we\nwere always meant to tell.
59	Don't give up. Ten years?\nYou kids deserve better.
60	The only thing that can change all this...
61	is the will of Ouroboros...
62	You kids, and you alone...
63	Though...some of us around here\nstill ain't too keen on the idea.
64	What?
65	So those people... From before...?
66	They're happy living in the moment.
67	As long as they can hide away and cover their eyes,\nthey don't give a damn about the rest.
68	So our lives mean nothing to 'em?
69	If they can't see or hear you,
70	then as far as they're concerned,\nyou don't even exist.
71	Closing their eyes...to what's in front of them.
72	Lot o' folks here think that way.
73	But that's... That's just like Moebius.
74	Then the only difference is...\nwhether or not they benefit directly.
75	You catch on quick.
76	I can see why my dad chose you guys.
77	But the will of the Founders...\nIt lives on in us warriors.
78	Moebius can't reign forever.\nIf we can continue freeing young folk like you...
79	maybe life can get back to how it should be.
80	That would be best for all of us.
81	For sure. I'm with you.
82	I think we'd have to be lunatics not to believe you,\nafter what you've shown us...
83	Ha...
84	I believe it too.
85	Seeing how you live your lives...\nIt made me feel really envious.
86	Feeling that warmth...

5	You're looking for Ghondor.
6	Ah, that's right!
7	So then...we've just gotta find this Ghondor, break 'em\nout of the prison camp and get the spark outta there?
8	Mm. Luckily, they don't kill us immediately\nafter we've been captured.
9	We're held beneath the Castle, in a detention facility.
10	To perform forced labor?
11	There's that as well.
12	But mostly, it's to set an example.
13	Example?
14	On the day of an eclipse, once a year,
15	they hold a mass execution of prisoners at\nHope's Rest, a hill on the Castle's south edge.
16	The whole event gets projected... High into the sky.
17	Oh no... So that's what you meant.
18	It's to show us we're powerless.
19	And the place they do this is "Hope's Rest"?
20	What kinda sick joke is that?
21	The next eclipse falls
22	about a month from now...
23	So that's our deadline for what we've gotta do:
24	contact the prisoner and get the intel on the Queens.
25	A month...
26	Mio...
27	Well, no two ways about it.
28	We better get started...now!
29	Yeah. And we better hurry.
30	We can't waste a single day.
31	Let's say we make it in without a hitch.
32	Won't the you-know-what give us away?

34	The red glowing Moebius eye thing.
35	Ohh, thaaaat...
36	Those eyepatches I gave ya?
37	There's a special alloy embedded in 'em.
38	Long as you got that, you'll be near invisible -\nslip clean under their noses.
39	And after we've got the info?
40	How do we get out?

11	Oh, it hasn't been as long as you think.
12	But, folk do tell me I'm pretty sharp.
13	Hah. That all?
14	How come you don't wake these guys up?
15	Couldn't you use the help?
16	Or is it...'cause they'd just be Moebius fodder?
17	They can't be fodder.
18	If we wake 'em up here, they'll be freed\nfrom the shackles of the Flame Clock.
19	So, why then?
20	Because this is our fight.
21	We don't know how long it'll take.
22	And their lives are short.
23	So you don't wanna get 'em mixed up in everything?
24	(snort) That's one reason.
25	And...the other?
26	People need to learn who they really are.\nWhat they have to leave behind for posterity.
27	I want them to wake up in a world...\nthat affords them that chance.
28	How do we discover who we really are...?
29	That from the husk?
30	Yeah.
31	You won't find yourself there.
32	Huh?
33	You've gotta look to the present and the future only.
34	The one in the past - it isn't "you".
35	You didn't make that and it's not yours.
36	Make that...?
37	But...look to the future, and you can\nbuild yourself up however you like.
38	You can become whoever you wanna be.
39	I can...?
40	You've got the power to do so.

20	We heard, from Eunie.
21	That you're just like us.
22	Oh. That part.
23	I've been plodding along, playing it all cool...
24	But when we saw *him* again, I thought...
25	Nah, snuff all of this.
26	I'm scared too... Just so you know.
27	Since Monica told us the whole truth...I've hoped...
28	No...
29	I'm sure I'll see Miyabi again.
30	I'm so sure of it.
31	Hard, wasn't it? Hearing that.
32	Yeah.
33	But...
34	It sure beats ignorance.
35	That's what Noah thinks too.
36	You're hard as nails.
37	What we don't know, might as well not exist...
38	It's an obvious way to think, but it isn't right.
39	Closing my eyes doesn't mean evil disappears.
40	And so... You go on?
41	Yeah.
42	I'll keep going, while my flame still flickers...

27	You've only got...a little over a month left.

68	That day... Guernica entrusted us with this power.
69	And because of that,\nwe made friends with...former enemies.
70	Believe us. Your "now"...
71	is safe with us.
72	As is the future.
73	So that's your argument?
74	[ML:undisp ](breath, deliberating)
75	What's this?
76	For the Cloudkeep.
77	Where the real Queen of Agnus is takin' her beauty sleep.
78	You'll need that to get in.
79	Kinda like a key.
80	[ML:undisp ](breath, surprised)
81	This thing took a liking to...
82	Uhhh... Names?
83	Noah.
84	Mio.
85	Noah and Mio.
86	I'll remember that.
87	Mm, anyways.
88	The doodad reacted to you two when you teamed up.
89	I think...it was probably, like, telling me to give it to you.
90	Thank you...
91	You're helping us now?
92	Still hate the fact that Bitchqueen sent you.
93	But hey, the wossname did pick you, so.
94	And I did promise.
95	Promise?
96	In three days, Agnus will be holding a large-scale\ntraining exercise on Daedal Isle.
97	Of course, that means minimal security for us.
98	That'll be our chance to escape.
99	How, then?
100	Hehe... Well, the only way I know how.
101	Am I right?! Ya dags!
102	Yeah!
103	I've got a bad feeling about this.
104	Yeah. The proverbial's gonna hit the fan.
105	Them's the breaks.
106	Take it or leave it.
107	All right. In three days.
108	Just do some prison things until then.
109	Oh, uh... Just try to keep in line, would ya?
110	We don't wanna draw attention.
111	We'll keep that in mind.
112	Oh and...a quick word of advice.
113	Hm?
114	When all is lost, let 'em hear you roar.
115	Got that?
116	Hear us...roar?

6	I don't know about Noah and Mio...
7	But me, though?
8	I'm pathetic.
9	Huh?
10	I'm just acting tough.

13	Yeah.
14	I'm a lot...

18	If we're weak...there's room to grow.
19	Right?
20	Huh...
21	Remember the first time you\nbecame Ouroboros? You yelled,
22	"Lanz! Come with me!", ah?
23	Mm...
24	You reached out...for the strength you needed.
25	Ooh...
26	Our friend Joran... He became Moebius.
27	But that... That wasn't him.
28	That's his life's purpose? Like spark it is.
29	So I think...
30	Maybe...I wanna figure out the purpose of my own life.
31	I wanna get stronger.
32	And if Joran's surpassed me...
33	I'll get even stronger than that.
34	Oh wow...
35	I won't be doing it for the recognition.
36	Nor to be liked.
37	I'll do it for myself.
38	Even if people don't recognize it? Right?
39	We're here. This is us.
40	Let's keep being true to ourselves.
41	What's wrong with that?
42	Same old...Lanz?
43	Same old...Sena.
44	Never stop being you. 'Kay?
45	Recognizing your own purpose... Huh.

2	My men'll cause a commotion outside,\ndraw out the guards and jailers.
3	The guards'll be armed,
4	so you dags'll need to deal with them.\nUse the element of surprise.
5	And the jailers?
6	They're small fry.\nI'll take care of 'em.
7	All right.
8	How many guards?
9	'Bout 30.
10	Take out 20 or so and we'll be sitting pretty.
11	Then we break straight through the west gate.
12	We'll have you lot covered, so just run for it.
13	And how do we "break through it"?
14	It's not like it's made of tissue...
15	Surely you lot can handle a gate?
16	Why else would the Bitchqueen even send you?
17	Why do you keep calling Monica that?
18	She's your mother.
19	I'll call her whatever the hell I like!
20	Anyways, you all got the gist of the plan now?
21	You call that a plan? There's nothing to get.
22	We don't even have any contingency measures, do we?
23	Tch.
24	I bet you're fun at parties. Arsehat...
25	I'd prefer "level-headed", thank you.
26	Anyhow.
27	We'll gather in front of Watchtower 1.\nAfter breaching the gate, thin out.
28	You run and you don't look back.
29	Clear?
30	OK. We'll do that.
31	Good. You're dismissed!
32	Ghondor.

16	Oooh, touchy.
17	Just don't screw this up!

19	You and Shania were...\n"friends from the crib", was that it?

9	You know that name pisses me off!

11	Stop *copying* me.
12	You're even wearing my gloves now?

5	You too, like everyone, have been making them all along.
6	If the results satisfy, that is well and good.

8	Will you weep, battered by grief?
9	Or howl, seething with rage?
10	Have you never prayed\nthat time would simply stop?
11	Have you wished the "now" would last forever...?
12	Your two lives, thriving and persisting\nfar beyond Homecoming,
13	surpassing the system of the world.

15	My name is Z,

5	[ML:undisp ](shivering breath)
6	Why is it that you are here?
7	Why did you split from your other self?
8	Why is it that you exist?
9	I thought I...wanted to know.
10	Know what?
11	I became an off-seer...
12	...because...I wanted to know the meaning\nbehind the smile.
13	Tell me.
14	...I had a friend.
15	As important to me as...\nAs Lanz and Eunie, or Joran.

2	Me, I'm good here.
3	Crys... What do you mean, you're good...?
4	Thank you.
evt/ev06/msg_ev06160100.json
0	Crys...\nI wondered...why he smiled back then.
1	And not just him...
2	Joran, too.
3	I wanted to know why.
4	That's why? Why you continued as an off-seer?
5	For the longest time...
6	I thought they pitied those of us left behind.
7	"Sucks to be you".\n"Sorry, guys".
8	"I'm checking out early".\n"It'll be tough, but keep your chins up".
9	I figured...that's what the smile said.
10	But now...
11	Mio, too,
12	was smiling.
13	I think I get it now...\nThe meaning behind the smile.
14	I think they were all content.
15	With the way it ended.
16	Like they were putting us in charge,
17	of the future.
18	Telling us to make a world where...\neveryone can smile...
19	But it just breaks my heart, that...\n*that* was the only smile they could choose...
20	And it really shouldn't have been...
21	The world we have now...
22	It doesn't give us the choice to smile.
23	If the world won't let us choose
24	outside these narrow bounds...
25	I want nothing more
26	than to rip this world apart.
27	I want to repay those smiles.
28	That's why I'm here.
29	And you won't choose...
30	the same path as your "other"?
31	...Who can tell?
32	I may end up doing that.
33	But...
34	I'll change it.
35	No matter what...
36	Because...that is the legacy that Mio left me.
37	Even if you're left alone?
38	Even if I'm alone.
39	In that case...
40	Let us walk together.

17	Why, Mio...?!\nWhy would you do this to me?!
18	You said you'd be by my side!
19	Mio! All I did, I did for you...!
20	You must have known.

1	Continuing uninterrupted, since the world\nwas taken captive, a long time ago.
2	Memories of me and him...
3	Why are you showing me this?
4	You are...
5	No, all of you are my repentance.
6	Repentance?
7	How I wanted us to be.
8	You embody all our hopes...
9	Our dreams of how this world should be.
10	Even though you and your friends\nshould never have existed,
11	the fact you are here is proof enough.
12	So you'll...let me live?
13	But, if you go through with this, you'll be...
14	To my Noah,
15	the time with me is everything.
16	I just want it to...end.
17	[ML:undisp ](sympathetic breath)
18	Moebius, like me... We can exist only by taking\nthe souls of those that grace this world.
19	Nobody pays the slightest mind to the thoughts,
20	and dreams those many lives espouse.
21	We gorge ourselves, covet every ember,
22	just to delay our inevitable ruin.
23	That's why you want to disappear?
24	If I die, maybe he'll see...\nMaybe he could somehow...realize what it is that I wish.
25	That would be enough...
26	Afterwards, it'll be up to you two...
27	to walk the path *we* ought to have walked...he and I.
evt/ev06/msg_ev06200100.json
0	The path they...ought to have walked...
1	So it's confirmed...
2	N and M are...other versions of Noah and Mio.
3	The other me... She passed all of her memories on to me.
4	So that I could share...everything with you.
5	"Share everything"?
6	I have to know.
7	How could you do this?
8	Why are you on their side?
9	What are you talking about?
10	I felt him, with these hands...
11	That sensation, the emotion...
12	It was no illusion.
13	And yet, you still became Moebius!
14	Harvesting people, without even batting an eye!
15	[ML:undisp ](shaky breathing)
16	I want to know why.
17	Isn't there a trace left inside you?\nOf your old feelings?

25	They're for you, Mio!
26	The time I had with you meant everything to me!
27	But now...it's all gone...
28	[ML:undisp ](cracked laughter)
29	If she truly is gone,\nI'll have to redo it all!
30	Watch me! Rewind our clocks, back to the start!
31	[ML:undisp ](scared gasp)
32	Noah... My long shadow...
33	You have stolen her away from me...
34	I will extinguish you, and take her back!
35	Mio is MINE!
36	[ML:undisp ](frightened gasp)

21	You put her there.

24	She never really wanted anything like that.
25	She just, she wanted to live out\nher precious days together with you.
26	You should've been able to give her that!
27	Is that...why she handed her life to you?
28	Is that why she rejected me?!
29	It's not rejection!
30	She understood, she always knew your reasons!
31	All she wanted was to end your misery...
32	That's the reason she gave this body to me.
33	By leaving this world behind,
34	she wanted to tell you - she didn't want "forever"...
35	She wanted to be there with you...!
36	And so she left me behind? She wouldn't do that!
37	How can we be together now?!
38	With her gone from the world, what's the point of it all?!

16	I've had it...
17	I've had it up to here!
18	[ML:undisp ](startled gasp)
19	[ML:undisp ](startled gasp)
20	Shania!
21	Drop it!
22	This isn't what I meant by "done"!

0	Are you ready, Sena?
1	Noah...
2	This is the fate that Shania chose.
3	It isn't the end.
4	Like she said herself, this is the beginning.
5	Come on. Up you get.
6	[ML:undisp ](small exert)
7	I don't know if it'll reach her...
8	But still... Sena, we'll do all we can.
9	Mhm...
evt/ev06/msg_ev06220100.json
0	I can't help but wonder...\nWould I have been able to save you?
1	I wanted time to stand still...
2	More than anything.
3	I felt completely powerless,
4	I wished time would stop.
5	If the moment could have lasted forever, we...
6	I wished for the unthinkable.
7	Just like N.
8	I proved to be just like him...
9	For my part, this is all I need.
10	When did...you two...?
11	It was when we first fought against M.
12	Ever since then, M and I were swapped around.
13	I see...\nI honestly thought you were M, back there.
14	You had me fooled.
15	...Maybe that's a bad way to put it.
16	In any case, I didn't realize at all.
17	I did try my best. I couldn't afford to fail.
18	If anyone suspected me, you'd\nhave all been executed on the spot.
19	But her feelings...
20	I couldn't simply let them go to waste.
21	M's...feelings...?
22	She wanted to give you everything that she knew about N,
23	to help us escape...
24	to break this never-ending Moebius curse...
25	To lose, and lose,\nand still stand back up,
26	even in the depths of despair...
27	She wanted you to have the strength\nto defeat those at the root of that despair.
28	She sure had a lot of faith in me. Uhh...
29	She believed, that if anyone in the world could\nmake it possible, it would be you.
30	That's why...she merged our wills\nso we could act, to further our goal.
31	Earlier, you said "it was fun"...
32	But it wasn't you, it was M...
33	I really think she meant it.
34	It was brief, but... Being who I am now...
35	Passing my thoughts along, on to you,
36	and receiving yours in turn...
37	She was...grateful.
38	I see...
39	From that moment, M's words were my words,
40	and my words were now hers.
41	Her life was scattered on the breeze,\nbut her memories, and her will
42	live on inside my heart...
43	Come.
44	I have something to show you.
45	Huh?
evt/ev06/msg_ev06225100.json
0	Here?
1	M was still unsure to the very last...\nwhether to show you the memory of this place.
2	But, I think it would be best.
3	This place... It was everything to N.
4	What do you mean...?
5	Well, you see...
6	This is where the City once stood.
7	It did?!
8	It was long ago.
9	The City back then, it was much more\nprosperous than now.
10	It positively teemed with people.
11	So then, it must've drawn\nMoebius's ire even more than now?
evt/ev06/msg_ev06230100.json
0	There it lies before you... Your heart's desire.
1	There is no life within.
2	You must breathe it into her yourself.
3	[ML:undisp ](shocked gasp)
4	Life from the people of the City...?!
5	You want me to end every one of them?!
6	Why the hesitation?
7	Existing in "this place" is by itself\na result of your own choices.
8	You are the one who chose the "endless now", are you not?
9	Your response should already be predetermined.
10	Such a shame...
11	Ah! Wait, please!
evt/ev06/msg_ev06231100.json
0	The City's inhabitants were the descendants
1	of M, N, and others who became\nOuroboros in the past.
2	In exchange for the lease on life\nthey would get as Moebius,
3	Z ordered N to kill the City's people.
4	Oh no...
5	Tell me! Tell me why!
6	I didn't...want to lose any more.
7	What do you mean, "any more"?!
8	Everything we held dear is gone! You took them all away,\nand you dare talk about your feelings of loss?!
9	Now, you...will continue to exist as Moebius.
10	The same...as myself.
11	[ML:undisp ](shaky, horrified breath)
12	So you did it. Sealed our fate...
13	Now we can live forever.

1	Impossible...
2	How could one ever choose between them?
3	Surely he couldn't...
4	do it...
5	And yet,
6	he did make a choice.
7	No one can truly judge him,\nfor the things he did.
8	Repentance.
9	Mhm...
10	The intentions they left behind...\nThey turned into us...
11	Mhm...
12	Of course it's heartbreaking, but...
13	But still, she was smiling...
14	We have to change things.
15	Yeah...
16	And this time, we'll succeed.
17	So it's set. Our new goal.

19	Yes...

21	I'm not feeling...very forgiving, either.
22	But guys,

25	Making someone choose the impossible...?\nIt's so cruel!

27	Looks like yer minds're made up.
28	'Ere, this is yours.
29	By the by...
30	Who is that Z sleazebag?
31	He's something like the head of all Moebius.\nOr so it seemed...
32	I've only met him in...the memories\nthat M showed me, though...
33	We now know his power is vast,\nfar greater than any of the others in Moebius.
34	Damn, so he's...
35	Yes. He is our true adversary.
36	The one who formed...the world we know.
37	Just who decided that this was how it should be?
38	If I knew who they were, or where, I'd...

3	Not what I meant, though.
4	I meant this whole thing.
5	Mio, that's right...
6	At that moment, everything just felt so\nutterly hopeless that it hurt.
7	There wasn't a thing I could do.
8	But it still worked out, right?
9	Heh...
10	Thanks to all of you being there.
11	Ahhh...
12	What?
13	Surprised you didn't choke on those words.
14	Well, of course not!
15	I can express some emotions.
16	[ML:undisp ](small laugh)
17	There has to be...a reason we met...hmm?
18	Say what?
19	It's something that Noah said once.
20	And you found a reason?
21	We've seen one wish granted...
22	True.
23	Still, we've got a way to go.
24	This isn't nearly the end.
25	No rest...for Ouroboros.
26	At least we've won ourselves an extension.
27	Ah, it'll work out somehow.
28	Eunie, am I sensing a streak of optimism?
29	I thought you were one to\nworry about the details a bit more.
30	Now I've got a reliable guy...
31	to stand by me, so.
32	Oh!

6	Should I cut it, or just leave it alone...?

8	You gotta keep it long! It'd be a crying shame!
9	Well, this body, it's been granted to me\nby my other self, right?
10	I dunno if it's fine for me to just... "Snip".
11	Yeah, that's a big question for sure.
12	Mm... The hair doesn't...just belong to me...
13	But it's...
14	It's what...?
15	It's...such a pain in the arse to wash!
16	Huh?
17	Whuh?

19	The washing takes ages, and the bedhead's a nightmare,
20	and don't get me started on the latrine...!
21	Ohh, say no more, love.
22	Oh, Mimi...
23	So, what do you think?
24	Uhh, well...
25	Look, why don't you just ask Noah?
26	This has nothing to do with him!\nIt's my problem and mine alone.
27	Is it just that...you're looking for permission?
28	I'd also settle for a no.
29	Hmmm...
30	[ML:undisp ]Tch...
31	Right then, let's sort this out.
32	We'll decide for you if you want.

evt/ev06/msg_ev06250100.json

1	Yes. It's where the Queen of Agnus lies sleeping.
2	And this is the key we need to get there.
3	You could throw yourself off,

5	Such is the fate of a Moebius.
6	You should know by now.
7	I-it's you...!
8	We've met before, when you were still human.
9	Your Majesty, m-my Queen...!
10	I will go to sleep, for a good long time indeed.
11	That should keep me out of Z's claws...
12	[ML:undisp ](surprised gasp)
13	Take this.
14	Whenever it is I wake up again,
15	the world...will be ripe for a change.
16	Until that time, keep it safe.
17	You should give it to those who deserve it.
18	How will I know who...?
19	They'll come before you. Of that, I have no doubt.
20	But why choose me?
21	Because you...
22	Nay, the two of you, one day...
23	You will certainly meet
24	your true selves.
25	Our true selves, huh...?
26	I must say, I'm surprised by the location.
27	It's right in the vicinity of Gamma and 9.
28	How has it escaped detection for all this time?
29	The area around the keep...\nIt's absolutely swimming with black fog.
30	And there's optic camouflaging on the structure itself.
31	So that'll be why.
32	Is that all from M's memories?
33	Mhm, all stuff she passed on to me.
34	Crazy...
35	Ghondor, you knew M?
36	Yeah, from a pretty long way back.
37	She's the one who gave me that\nbloody thing in the first place.
38	She said you lot were our last hope.
39	Asked us to lend you our assistance and junk.
40	She musta been guarding the Queen's words.
41	Yeah... For proper yonks and yonks, and no mistakin'.
42	And that's also the reason that\nyou were waitin' for us?
43	Cooped up there, all that time?
44	Busted!
45	And the "thousand lives" thing? What...was all that?
46	Nice spiel, right?\nI wrote it!
47	Are you serious?\nSnuff, that's a letdown...
48	You what?!
49	Let's head out as soon as we're ready.
50	Moebius are still out and about...
51	We don't have to worry about Mio's lifespan any more,\nbut we can't just sit around.
52	OK?
53	Yeah, definitely.
54	Erm, guys...?

59	[ML:undisp ]Hm?
60	There's a place...other than Cloudkeep,\nthat I really need to go to.
61	"Really need"...?
62	It seems you're rather troubled.
63	Are you certain it's really that vital?
64	It's Colony Omega.
65	Omega? Wh-?
66	No way... It's still there?!
67	The Colony I lived in with Miyabi...
68	It was under the control of Moebius Y.
69	I learned something important from the other me.
70	Miyabi's...still alive.
71	This Miyabi... She clearly means a lot to you, then.
72	I'm happy to leave the decision to you.\nOf course, we can head for the keep first.
73	This is something personal for me.
74	Right, I hear you.
75	OK. To Omega.
76	If Mio's saying she has to go there,
77	then we will. We'll make it high priority.

32	only lack of choice!
33	Lack of choice...?
34	Just look at how the world is for us.
35	It wouldn't... It would never allow us\nto take any other form.
36	So we have to change it!
37	For weak people like us...
38	Weak?
39	You're weak?
40	[ML:undisp ](shaky breath)
41	On that day, weren't you smiling?
42	Oh yes, I sure was smiling!
43	Because it was the moment I rose above you!
44	It was a grin of victory!
45	No it wasn't!
46	On that day, you...
47	That was the real you!
48	Our friend, Joran!
49	...Stop mocking me...
50	Look, you'd made it, Joran!
51	You spread your true wings!
52	[ML:undisp ](shocked gasp)
53	Joran...
54	Your death, it changed me.
55	Fighting isn't everything...
56	I learned that if I chose, I could\nchange myself, become anything.
57	Joran... I'm grateful as spark to you.
58	Ain't you the same, Joran?
59	Maybe, if you had the choice too...
60	In a world...where nothing has to be like this...!
61	And that's exactly the kind of world we want to create!\nWe want choices!
62	Remember, you're Moebius! You should\nhave other, nice memories as well!
63	You have to try and remember them, anything at all!
64	[ML:undisp ](thoughtful breath)
65	I... I've seen all kinds of death.
66	Taken a long hard look at myself.
67	So let me tell you:
68	Joran, you're...
69	You're more than this!
70	[ML:undisp ]((emotionally) wounded exert)
71	Joran, you've given me so much.
72	You helped me find the will,\nto endure these ten hard years!
73	Come to us please, Joran!
74	Let's all stand together...
75	You don't belong with them...\nYou just don't.
76	Was that also...me?
77	That day, it was like...my body just moved.
78	Hey hey hey HEY!

88	D...! You scum!
89	Ever...had dreams?
90	Dreams of dying, of being slaughtered...?
91	[ML:undisp ](shocked gasp)
92	Ah, well, most people forget soon as they wake.
93	No harm done.
94	But tell you what...
95	They're all completely true.
96	And so snuffin' what? What if they were?
97	The past is past, and the present is now!
98	I wasn't finished!
99	Dreams, y'see...
100	They're little traces of intense memories from\nyour past lives, that didn't get purged before rebirth...
101	Little harmless bugs in the system, let's call 'em.
102	However!
103	Not so with Moebius.
104	Just like the runt said,\nwhen you become Moebius,
105	in that very moment,
106	all your past memories come rushing back to you.
107	To put it mildly...it's...
108	It's transcendent.
109	[ML:undisp ](gasp, taken aback)
110	Before coming here,
111	I went to visit the Ferronis\nwhere I keep my collection.
112	Collection, you say?
113	There they were...
114	Staring back at me!
115	He's mad...
116	Well? Huh? Doesn't it make you tingle?
117	As long as I am Moebius,
118	I can enjoy this superlative feeling forever and ever!
119	I'll bury the world in my sweet collectibles!
120	[ML:undisp ](gags a little bit)
121	I think I'm gonna hurl...
122	Push through it!
123	First, we gotta save Joran...from this shitbag!
124	Yeah Eunie, what Lanz said!
125	This punk needs a whoopin'!
126	All right...
127	OK, will do!
128	We'll thrash this shitbag, save Joran...
129	And get me...some payback!
130	If you fancy your chances, take your shot.
131	I'll be more than happy to rip your bloody pelts off
132	and add them to my collection!

0	300 days remain to the Intersection.
1	It seems we might make it.
2	Yes.
3	It took every bit of our combined intellects...\nBut we built it.
4	To prepare for the time our two worlds collide...
5	All that we are is contained within.
6	Memories, and our souls...
7	We will all be gone, and then reborn.
8	Will it be a new beginning, or our demise...?
9	No one can tell us that.
10	Time will run its due course,
11	and show us the true meaning...of our deed.
evt/ev07/msg_ev07040100.json
0	In the distant past,
1	what was once a single world\nwas cleft in twain.
2	Plus and minus...\nOn the surface, they were identical.
3	These two worlds, of opposing nature,
4	knew nothing of each other
5	as they wended their way towards\ntheir own respective futures.
6	However, the worlds yearned for each other.
7	Against the solitude of existence,
8	they strove to reunite...
9	though it would spell certain destruction.
10	Should the two worlds intersect,
11	they would cancel each other out\nand cease to be,
12	leaving only light.
13	Light...
14	A shining beacon in the darkness.\nThe last common language left to us.
15	Though we inhabited separate worlds, the medium of\nlight allowed us to communicate for the very first time,
16	and so we sought for a way to\nprevent total oblivion...
17	We pooled our knowledge, and through time\ngave birth to a single point of hope...
18	Origin.
19	An ark, containing all the worlds' data,
20	recorded in words of light,
21	carrying hope into the future...
22	Origin was a system we constructed\nto reboot the worlds' states.
23	And then...
24	the time was upon us.
25	The reboot process failed to initiate.
26	Instead, in that instant,
27	the worlds became still.
28	By the will of Moebius.
29	So it's their fault...
30	And at the heart of it,
31	was their ringleader, Z.
32	You could say Z embodies this frozen world.
33	But what does that achieve? Freezing everything?
34	Not a thing...
35	He didn't need to do anything after that.
36	Only...
37	to keep everything in its place, in stasis,
38	and create an eternity to abide within,
39	as was their wish.
40	He made our lives their sustenance...
41	Precisely so.
42	In order to gain control of Origin,
43	Z captured the Kevesi Queen.
44	To what end?
45	To access the memories in Origin,
46	to bend them to his will,
47	he needed a key, held only by its creators.
48	A key?
49	A heart...might be more fitting.
50	Z used the key held by the Queen of Keves
51	and seized Origin in its entirety.
52	Controlling Origin...means controlling the world.
53	And having shackled it, he can bend it to his will.
54	Life and death...are his playthings.
55	Life and...death...
56	No one, not even M, knew\nthe origins of this world.
57	[ML:undisp ](slow breath)
58	So I guess... You have another key?
59	Yes, it's in my possession.
60	With its help, I was able to create...
61	the Ouroboros Stones.
62	(gasp)
63	Though most of the power is with Z,
64	I have been able to...resist him, to a small extent.
65	It's a...cogwheel?
66	One of the gears from Origin.
67	Through a process of catalysis, between the\nOrigin substrate and the Core in my chest,
68	I can generate the Stones.
69	And thanks to that, we became Ouroboros...
70	Yes, but...not completely.
71	Huh?
72	Remember. Have you not succumbed\nto Moebius's power before?
73	[ML:undisp ](pained remembrance)
74	As I've said before, Z commands the\nworld's very fabric.
75	Unfortunately, my own powers\nare sorely limited.
76	And yet, you too can break Z's fetters,\nas you've shown,
77	smashing through the rules he established.
78	With your Ouroboros powers,\nand the Sword of the End both.
79	The Sword...of the End?
80	The sword you hold...
81	It is a byproduct of resonance...\nbetween the Kevesi Queen's heart, and Origin.
82	Does that mean...
83	it's like an Ouroboros Stone?
84	The Ouroboros Stones, and the sword...
85	They're mere gimmicks.
86	The crux of them lies with you.
87	You see, there are keys inside of you too.
88	Inside of us...
89	Keys...?
90	Finally,
91	my efforts were rewarded.
92	I'm glad... To meet with all\nof you who embody hope...
93	Majesty, what is it that we must do?
94	Right.
95	Infiltrate Origin, then free it\nand the Kevesi Queen...
96	from Z...
97	From the hands of Moebius, once and for all.
98	If we do free it, will we get to change the world?
99	It's so cruel and senseless... Can we undo that?
100	[ML:undisp ](questioning breath)
101	Your Majesty...?
102	If you desire...to have a future before you...
103	[ML:undisp ](soft breath)
104	I need to know.
105	Z, and Moebius...\nMust they be our enemy?
106	Noah...
107	Now that...is something for you to decide.
108	After confronting them, and discerning\nfor yourselves what they truly are.
109	All right.

37	I couldn't work out why myself, it was so sudden.
38	Noooo...!
39	Is this why you blew us off saying\nto ask the Queen ourselves?!
40	Uh... Sorry, Eunie...
41	Oh love...
42	I suspect, it must be Z.
43	Huh?
44	The power of Moebius... It's part\nof the flow and fabric of the world.
45	What is permitted, and what is prohibited,
46	is subject to Z's whims.
47	Even with Origin, not every Moebius\nknows of its existence.
48	But I was able to use the Ouroboros powers...
49	The power you currently wield is,\nlet's say, external to the flow.
50	Even Z himself cannot grasp what's beyond his reach.
51	Therein is my hope based.
52	Hm...

13	Torpedo wrap without Tasty Sausage\nlike ship without engine!
14	Mr. Samon, what is it the engine needs?
15	To be precise, just need core component.
16	Is this part here, and still need six more to make.
17	Unfortunately, only have this one here.
18	I've seen that metal before...
19	It's the same as Noah's sword, right?
20	Yeah, looks like it.
21	Also, it same as metal that go\ninside fancy eyepatches of Lost Numbers.
22	Friends know eyepatches block\nMoebius tracking, surely?
23	Yeah, we heard that from Monica.
24	That because eyepatch emit special wavelengths.
25	This here show sources of such waves.
26	Points of light on map indicate where\nmetal can be located.
27	But Samon could not visit. Every place\nis fearsome-scary.
28	Can't you just use the metal from the eyepatches?
29	Those important equipment for\nLost Numbers, so no-can-do.
30	And even if could, metal is stretched into\nthin foil, making total amount not sufficient.
31	That's a shame...
32	Mio, look over here...
33	Yeah! The Cloudkeep.
34	It's that thing that the Queen had!
35	Mr. Samon.
36	So if we got you six more,\nyou could complete the ship?
37	Naturally.
38	With that, can make ship with power and defense\nthat weather any storm or hole in sea.
39	How long would it take to build?
40	Would give it three days, tops.
41	Wow, that's real snappy.

32	I mean...
33	We're gonna plunge into the Great Sea's vortex...
34	And after that?
35	Origin is protected on every side\nby thick armor plating.
36	You think you'll find a berth?
37	I guess, uh...maybe?
38	For starters, we don't even know Origin's\ngeneral schematic.
39	We're going in blind.
40	(frustrated sigh)
41	[ML:undisp ](adlib little smirk)
42	Take this.
43	Wh-what's this?
44	Is this...Origin?
45	A certain Nopon engineer was involved
46	on the Agnian side of Origin's construction.
47	That's an early blueprint, left behind from those days.
48	The Great Sea's vortex...is likely born from\nthe force field emitted by this middle part,
49	amplified by the structure built up around the\ncircumference. That would be my best guess, anyway.
50	As for the original purpose of the structure,
51	it was a device to deploy a field to protect the\nfacility while it generated an omni-static space.
52	Consequently, this middle section here... It lacks the\narmored shell, making it Origin's only weak point.
53	[ML:undisp ](audible confusion)
54	So then, basically, this is our entrance.
55	Enter the vortex, and then using its flow,\nbreak through to the inside.
56	Once you are within, destroy the force field\ngenerator at the center.
57	That's the trick.
58	Yes, I see...
59	However, the internal structure of Origin
60	may well have been heavily modified by Z.
61	Even after you make it in, you must be on your guard.
62	Understood.\nWe'll be fully prepared.
63	Huh, you gotta hand it to the Queen, though.
64	How could anyone know all that?!
65	Shocking, I know!
66	Absolutely.
67	I simply cannot believe this!
68	C'mon you lot, make your minds up already, will you?
69	By the way...
70	After you met up with M, you were\nsleeping here all this time, right?
71	Yes.
72	So then, how did you know we'd become Ouroboros?
73	You seemed to know what had happened at the Castle as well...
74	Even as I sleep,
75	I learn. Information on everything\nin this world collects right here.
76	Thank you so much, for all this!
77	I promise you, we will seize the future!

13	They can't be brought back once they die.
14	Why's that?
15	I'm not sure, myself.
16	Although, each of them is fundamentally aware of this.
17	That's why they're afraid. Of death.
18	They're scared, huh?
19	I guess...Joran knew too.
20	And he still...killed himself...
21	And now, he's really gone.
22	Still... He left us a parting gift.
23	Yeah...

25	I'll never forget it. Not until my dying breath.
26	Mm...
27	What lies beyond death, that Moebius fear it so?

39	Unlike those people who were granted a Moebius body,
40	he is a true Moebius.
41	Sounds ominous...
42	So he's not even an individual?
43	He is and he isn't.
44	There is some Moebius within you, too.
45	But...perhaps you've realized that?
46	[ML:undisp ](small breath)
47	Your Aionios...lies in frozen time.
48	Born from the Moebius wish that chose\nthe endless now.
49	So then, both us and the world...
50	Everything that exists, it's all false?
51	Everything that exists is reality.
52	Present lives,
53	and future ones...
54	Moebius aside, the wills of countless\npeople persist...

61	Very well. There remains but one\nmore thing I have to say to you.
62	Noah.

77	I shall return to the Castle, and free the soldiers\nfrom the Flame Clock's bondage.
78	Otherwise, their lives will only feed Z's power.
79	Nice thinking, Your Majesty!
80	Countin' on ya!
81	Oh, uh, will you need an escort...?
82	I would think not.
83	Might you have forgotten who I am?

86	We're all gonna make it through this, I promise!

4	How many times is it now...
5	that I...and you...\nhave confronted each other here like this...?
6	Yes, you're welcome to come on up.
7	How many incarnations?\nHow many ascents into the spotlight?
8	And once again, I shall endeavor to ask this of you...
9	Tell me...why not resign yourself to the flow?
10	It's unfortunate... Sounds like my\nmemory isn't all that.
11	You have come to stop the flow, have you not?
12	This march of time, stilled for eternity.
13	You intend to stop it by removing me.
14	So is it flowing, or is it stopped?
15	You're not making any sense, mate.
16	Basically, if we can take you down, the world kicks up again.
17	At least, that's what I'm picking up from all that.
18	Human desires can be...\nmuch likened to a river flowing.
19	All humanity yearns for it...
20	The endless now.
21	That is why I'm here, you'll find.
22	My existence alone... It is proof and evidence.
23	Cut the crap.
24	Who in the world would possibly wish for this?
25	I refuse to be controlled by you!
26	Although, thanks to the stunts you pulled,\nwe managed to twig on to a whole lotta stuff.
27	We learned how best to use the time we have.
28	And for that, you get a real good thanking.
29	You said it.
30	Though ten years is a mere glimpse,\nwe now know the importance...of true choice.
31	We'll build it for ourselves.
32	A world with the freedom to choose!
33	Not a hollow world of fiction like this one!
34	Everyone wants a reality that they can believe in!
35	Freedom is nothing more than fiction...\nA deception.
36	Those with power, those who can choose\nthink nothing of it.
37	What then of those who cannot choose?
38	What about the meek and frail?
39	Not everyone is granted as many options\nas you all have!
40	Will you share? Give them some of yours?
41	Will you call that charity?
42	Or compassion? Will you show it?
43	Imagining them who are granted it\nto be thus satisfied?
44	Imagining not a piece of wretchedness to remain?
45	Making the best possible choices under duress.\nLiving the best life.
46	There are no losers in the world I offer.
47	With a turn of the clock,\nanyone can be a winner, given the time.
48	The only thing we ever do is take lives!\nThere is no winning!
49	You can't just invent some rule!
50	Why do you recoil from taking lives?
51	The world itself has set this rule - why...resist?
evt/ev07/msg_ev07350100.json
0	It is through consumption of life\nthat this world persists.
1	Denying it is self-delusion.\nThe only outcome, self-destruction.
2	It is unequivocal fact!
3	The imperative that is intrinsic to all living things!
4	[ML:undisp ](gasp)
5	The source of our power, and of all living things, lies therein.
6	Young, spirited people, trading lives, aiming for new,\never-loftier heights with each new day...
7	That explosive motive power is something we lack.
8	The essence - of life!
9	And we are here...to express ourselves\nas an embodiment of life!
10	So that's it...\nThat's what you're getting at...
11	And just for that...you gave those two\nan impossible choice?!
12	Is that why you made Joran and Crys into Moebius?!
13	...Of course.
14	As for the why...
15	It's because it amuses me!
16	(appalled gasp)
17	The action-packed drama of your lives...\nWe are its foremost audience!
18	Now then, play it out for me.\nWhat will the next act entail?
19	Bereavement? Or revenge?
20	A revolution, perchance...
21	This world is never boring.
22	Not while your lives continue to make it so effervescent!
23	I'll end him...!
24	I just got it.
25	Huh?
26	Fighting in order to live...
27	The words Miyabi left me with...
28	Now... This is exactly when they were for.
29	Yeah... Mio's got it right.
30	At first it was all fun and games.
31	When we got Ouroboros powers, we were\njust like, happy to get to live a little longer.
32	That was it.
33	But now,
34	things're different.
35	We learned that for many, there aren't\nany choices on the table at all.
36	Because they were taken from them,\nby a bunch of crusty old mudders.
37	The strength you talk about\nis all just smoke and mirrors.
38	Real strength is different!
39	That's right.
40	Knowing when to be close\nand when to let go...
41	Walking together, eventually choosing\nwho you really are...
42	That is strength.
43	And that's the real battle here...
44	To find that answer!
45	The will to choose our actions, moment to moment.
46	And if you dare denounce that common right,
47	we will defy you!
48	To live in a future...over which you lay no claim!

5	5	If it's been cast off like trash, is\nit even worth trying to salvage it?

7	8	Thanks to Nopon rearguard, Noah and\nfriends survive battle, go home with\nbum-bum in single piece.
8	8	Don't friends think friends should heed\nadvice of experienced colleague?
9	3	...I guess maybe we should.
10	5	Oh, so you're a badass now, eh, Riku?\nMaybe next time you wanna join us on\nthe frontline, huh? That sound fun?

7	1	I ought to take care\nof the off-seeing.
8	8	Of course. We have time.

1	8	Such long walkings tough on legs of Riku...\nRiku totally pooped.
2	1	It was a massive battle. But we don't\nseem to have taken too many injuries,\nfortunately.
3	5	Yeah, well, I guess that's the upside\nof going against a low-rank, no-mark\ncolony like that.
4	3	On the flipside, we didn't manage to\nfill up the Flame Clock all that much...
5	T	Ah, it's all for the best.\nAt least we've all come\nback in one piece.
6	1	I agree. And anyway, we should be\nall right on that front, for the time being.
7	8	Noah, talking out here just waste time.\nHow about friends move chatter into bath?

12	T	I'll show you some top-notch accessories.
13	3	Could do worse than take\na bit of advice from a battle-worn\nhardcase like Mwamba, huh?

15	8	Then we go to Commissary?

3	10300	Sure, no problem at all.\nWhat's the trouble?
4	hX10400	It's just, I happened to skim over everyone's\nCollectopaedia Cards earlier, and...
5	hX10400	Well, looks like a bunch of people are\nstill a bit behind on preparations for\nthe big mission.
6	hX10400	If you happen on anything they could use\nwhile you're out and about, would you mind\nthrowing it to them using the cards?
7	10300	I hear you loud and clear.\nWhen we find the materials, we just register\nthem on the Collectopaedia Cards, right?
8	hX10800	That's right, same way as always.\nSorry and thanks again!
9	3	That Roald sure likes sticking his beak\nin other people's business. Remind you\nof anyone else we know, eh, Lanz?
10	5	Hah! Bang on. Still, at least there's\nrewards attached to it. I say we go for it.\nThat way everyone benefits.
11	8	How very like Lanz to weigh benefits\nso careful-like.
12	5	Whatchu say, furball?!
13	1	All right, all right. Let's get our heads\nback in the game and be on our way\nto Alfeto Valley.

1	5	The spearhead squad.
2	T	Huh, Volffs?
3	T	They're not much of an enemy if\nyou take 'em on one at a time.\nStill...
4	1	The main objective of the op is still ahead.\nIf these guys've hit an impasse, we ought\nto help them.
5	3	I thought you'd say something like that.
6	sX1	Hey! You lot!
7	1	Hang tight, we'll back you up!

1	5	Since Nopon can't use Irises,\nisn't it a pain to have to keep\nfiddling with a terminal?
2	8	No fear. Riku take it in stride.
3	8	Also if pretend to not look at terminal,\ncan ignore all sort of troublesome\nand tiresome communications.
4	5	Whoa, that's kinda smart.
5	1	Riku! Watch out!

4	1	The mission hasn't changed.
5	1	We'll stand by round here till the\nscheduled start of the operation.
6	3	Roger that!
7	3	Should we grab a bite to eat?
8	5	Good shout.
9	8	Noah... Something up?
10	1	I've just got this uneasy feeling...\nIt won't go away.
11	3	The thing we were talking about before?
12	5	Mate, you're thinking too hard, as usual.\nThink it could just be the pressure\nweighing on you a bit?
13	1	Heh, yeah, maybe.
14	5	...Oh for snuff's sake.
15	5	We've still got a bit of time. How about\nblowing off a bit of steam with a quick\nsparring sesh?
16	3	Huh? C'mon, we've got the operation soon.\nShouldn't we just rest?
17	5	Nah, this is exactly the sort of time\nyou want to get your heart rate up.
18	5	Nothing like going toe-to-toe to get out\nof your head. Really helps you focus.
19	8	Never mind empty-headed proposal\nof Lanz, Noah.
20	5	Shut it, fluff-bag!
21	8	Riku vote for having mindful moment\nin quiet place. Checking in on state of self!
22	1	OK...
23	1	Thank you, Lanz.
24	1	Why don't we train a bit now so we can\ngive it everything in the battle?
25	5	Nice.
evt/fev/msg_fev01170020.json
0	1	It's almost time.
1	1	Let's review the details of the operation.
2	1	Our mission objective lies in Alfeto Valley.
3	1	An unidentified ether source has\nbeen reported. We are tasked with\nsurveying it and destroying it.
4	8	Waypoint marked out on map now.\nPlease to have look at waypoint on map!
5	1	The advance party should have already\narrived at the planned contact point.
6	3	It's time we headed out too, then!
7	5	Let's get the snuff out of here.
8	5	A royal decree, eh?\nI don't know about all this...
9	5	But let's get out there and square it away\nas quick as we can!
evt/fev/msg_fev01270010.json
0	3	Hey. You OK?
1	1	Huh?
2	3	I mean, you and the Agnian off-seer\ntransformed into that weird thing.
3	1	Yeah... Well, for what it's worth, that\ndidn't seem to do any damage or anything.
4	5	Hey, Eunie.
5	5	Go ahead and take point looking for\nhostiles, will you? Until we make it\nback to Colony 9.
6	3	Gotcha.
7	1	Lanz, that's not really nec-
8	5	You're the most depleted\nout of the lot of us, mate.
9	5	It's a long way to Colony 9. If you wanna\nmake it back in one piece, you'll need to\nbe careful.
10	8	Much fighting on way back, probably.
11	1	Yeah... You've got a point.
12	3	So, we done?\nCan we head on?
evt/fev/msg_fev01300010.json
0	2	Oh no!
1	2	Guess they knew we'd come here...
2	iY1	You're the ones that raided the Colony!\nI ain't lettin' you get away!
3	9	Oh! Someone having real bad mood...
4	6	But why...?\nIt's like nobody recognizes us...
5	4	As of this moment, the point is moot.\nClearly, we ought to prioritize our\nphysical safety.
6	6	But-
7	4	Sena! Come on. You don't want to get\nslaughtered by our allies, do you...?
8	2	I don't get it at all...
9	2	But we can't go back to Colony Gamma\nwith things like this.
10	2	Taion. Is there somewhere we can\nhide out?
11	4	I suppose where we bade farewell to\nour new "friends" might do.
12	2	Understood.
13	2	Let's try to slow him down at most.
14	4	Exactly my thoughts.
15	6	...(sob)
evt/fev/msg_fev02030010.json
0	1	OK. Everyone ready?
1	2	Yeah.
2	9	Tasty treats... Check!
3	5	I just took a quick look-see, and this\nequipment seems surprisingly quality.
4	5	Dontcha think?
5	6	Uh, yeah! Looks that way!
6	2	That "City" we're headed for...\nLooks like it'll be a long journey.
7	4	I've found us a route heading south.\nWill that work for you?
8	2	Thanks, Taion.
9	3	Hey! You've got some\nreal handy data there.
10	2	I guess we should head through the caves,\nand toward Millick Meadows first, then.
11	1	Chin up, guys. Let's get going.
evt/fev/msg_fev02040010.json
0	6	What's that...?
1	6	Hey, Mimi. You can see that Ferronis, over\nby the side of the big outcrop there, right?
2	2	Oh yeah...
3	4	Odd. I don't have any data about a colony\nestablished in this locale.
4	3	Odd for sure...
5	3	Noah, take a good look.\nIsn't it kinda...old?
6	1	It does look like it's seen\nquite a bit of service.
7	5	Yeah. I don't think they make 'em\nlike that any more.
8	2	Erm... Do you think it's safe to be around?
9	3	You're freaking me out a bit here, Mio.
10	6	Sorry!
11	4	I don't think an apology is necessary.
12	2	Do you think there could be some\nuseful resources and stuff in there still?
13	4	A possibility, certainly.
14	4	It's in the general direction of our\nobjective. Why not investigate it?
15	1	All right. Let's check it out!
evt/fev/msg_fev02100010.json
0	3	Ooh... That felt great!
1	1	How are you feeling, Mio?
2	2	Great, since I cooled off in the lake.
3	6	Glad to hear it.
4	5	I worked up a chonkin' appetite\nwith all that moving about.
5	1	I'm sure we still have some rations left.\nGrab some after you've rested.
6	4	This is turning into quite the leisurely\npleasure cruise, isn't it...?
7	5	Hey, man. I seem to remember you\nagreeing to have a rest at the oasis too.
8	4	Sure. I adjudged it necessary to take\na short break and check the route.
9	3	Taion... C'mon, take a dip. Cool off that\noverheated cranium of yours.
10	4	I don't think so. Even in a highly open\ndesert locale with good sight-lines like this,\nwe must maintain a lookout at all times.
11	2	Yeah... I guess you're right.
12	2	Hey... Thanks. I can go on, because of you.
13	2	In fact, you've helped me out a lot of\ntimes since we joined forces, Taion.
14	6	Yeah, dude. If it wasn't for you,\nI don't know if I'd still be here in\none piece.
15	4	That's what I'm here for. To determine\nthe best course of action, tactically and\nstrategically.
16	1	Hey, Taion. Do you think you could tell us\nthe way out of this desert, then?
17	4	Naturally.
18	4	We bear further south, into the Ribbi Flats.
19	6	Sounds like another massive hike, on foot.
20	3	If we've got so much walking through the\nwilds ahead of us, why don't we make\ncamp here for the day?
21	5	Could probably do with topping up the\nwater supplies too, I reckon.
22	4	Not a terrible line of reasoning.\nHowever...
23	2	Taion, we've been hiking through a wasteland\nfor a while. You need to rest, same as the rest\nof us. Didn't you admit as much just now?
24	2	And what's more, I'm starving too!
25	6	Haha! Attagirl!
26	9	Manana's tummy hear someone\ntalking about food.
27	1	Riku! Manana!\nWhere did you get to?
28	8	Went on little search for tasty treats.
29	9	Since we now at lush oasis, morsels\neven tastier than pack rations can be had!
30	9	Tickle of tastebuds make chuckle\nin heart and soul! Good for morale,\ngood for mood!
31	9	So Manana will keep eyes to ground\nin search of ever-tastier treats!
32	5	So you're gonna be cooking something up\nfor us, huh?
33	9	Correct muchly.
34	6	Manana's a total diva when it\ncomes to cuisine, I can confirm.
35	6	But-
36	9	Planned cuisine take two hours to make.\nIn meanwhile, please endure hunger with\npatience, like well-behaved soldiers.
37	5	What the spark? Two hours?\nNothing's worth that kinda wait...
38	3	C'mon. All you need to do is chuck\na few ingredients in a pot. Is there\nreally that much to it?
39	9	Meh! Such unkind and untrue words!
40	9	Friends think food is nothing more\nthan fuel for furless meat sacks?!\nSuch rotten attitude!
41	9	Manana can offer incredible tasty cuisine!\nNot simply chuck stuff in pot then deliver\nunceremoniously into mouth-hole!
42	1	Manana, would you like us to help you out\nwith the cooking? Then maybe it would get\nto our mouth-holes a bit faster.
43	9	Meh meh!\nAcceptable.
44	9	But if friends want to help Manana\nin cooking duties, certain boundary\nmust be set.
45	9	Tasting is 100% purview of Manana!
evt/fev/msg_fev02100020.json

1	1	We'd better cover as much distance as\nwe can, before it gets even hotter.
2	4	I estimate we're about halfway\nthrough this wilderness now.
3	6	Hang in there, Mimi. You can do it.
4	2	Yeah, I guess.
5	5	All right! Let's roll out!

4	@Z1	So make yourselves at home.
5	2	Thanks a lot!
6	@Z1	The commander told me\nsomething else as well.
7	@Z1	That you guys helped out\neveryone here at the colony,\nand we all owe you a lot.
8	@Z1	I'm afraid I won't have time to attend you\npersonally, but if there's anything you need\nwhile you're here, just let us know, OK?
9	@Z1	Well, I'll leave you to it.
10	4	What a reception!
11	9	Solon seem like nice person.
12	1	Maybe we should go in and rest.
13	5	Cool.
14	3	Ah, I think I'd like to take\na bath first, actually.
15	6	Hey, Eunie-love. If you're\nheaded to the bath-
16	3	Ewww... YOU called ME "love"...?\nThat makes me feel weird.
17	3	Let's just stick with plain ol' "Eunie", OK?

0	9	Goodest of mornings!
1	6	Morning, Manana!
2	1	OK. Everyone's here.
3	1	We got word from Ethel a little while ago.
4	1	There's something she wants to tell us,\nand we should go to the Council Room\nto hear it.
5	4	Very well.
6	2	We should say thanks for this tent, at least.
7	3	OK! Let's go see what\nEthel has to say then.
evt/fev/msg_fev03090010.json
0	5	OK. So what now?
1	4	I believe the southward route is currently\nblocked by rockfall. I would estimate that\nclearing it will take some time...
2	1	I guess we'll just have to wait till it's done...
3	2	Uh, guys. Can I say something?
4	3	Huh? Sounds heavy...
5	2	I've been thinking and... I think there might\nbe something else that we could try.
6	4	You mean, about Colony 4...?\nIt's hardly your responsibility.
7	2	Taion, it's not quite like that.
8	2	I mean, if I see someone in trouble,\nI just want to help them.
9	2	Maybe it's not a sense of responsibility,\nexactly. It's more like a natural reaction.
10	4	Oh... You feel that even\nfor a former enemy?
11	2	That's how I feel about it...\nRight now, at least.
12	6	Mimi... Your heart's big enough for\neveryone to have a slice.
13	1	OK, well, no time like the present!\nLet's do something to help!
14	5	Yeah, why not? Ethel helped us out\nway back, after all.
15	3	Now we've got a chance to give something\nback, right?
16	4	...I suppose it'll help us earn their trust.\nAnd kill a bit of time, maybe.
17	6	I...I think Mimi's right!
18	2	Guys... Thanks.
19	5	Right, well, that was heartwarming,\nto be sure. But what are we going to\ndo to help exactly?
20	4	Lanz, you need to expend some mental\nenergy on it yourself instead of blurting\nquestions. I get this may be tricky for you.
21	5	Oi, watch it, buddy!
22	1	Well, if we're going to do that, perhaps\na little intelligence-gathering is in order.
23	3	Yeah, I guess we gotta. It's one thing\nto want to lend a hand, another to know\nwhere to stick it.
24	2	I guess we'd better ask\naround the colony then!
25	6	Hmmm...
26	2	Still feeling weird about this?
27	6	N-no... It's just...
28	3	What, worried about helping the bad guys?\nIt's a bit late for that, love.
29	3	Anyway, if anyone tries to stir\nthe pot again, we'll just punt 'em\nunder a Levnis, right?
30	3	...And by "we", I mean Lanz, obviously.
31	4	I'd like to call ixnay on the punting,\nif it's not too much bother. I'm afraid\nit would get quite messy.
32	5	C'mon... It was just a\nfigure of speech, mate.
33	1	OK then! Everyone good to start\nasking round the colony to find out\nhow we can help?
evt/fev/msg_fev03100010.json
0	1	They should be finished clearing the\nlandslide soon. We'll be able to set out\nto Ribbi Flats.
1	4	Colony 4's engineers are excellent.\nThey took care of that faster than\nI thought they would.
2	3	I guess we'll be saying\nbye-bye to Colony 4.
3	2	Ethel and the others have been good to us.\nI'd like to see her before I go.
4	6	Yeah, I want to do that too.
5	5	I guess we all should.\nLet's go mob Command!
6	7	The landslide clearance is complete.\nI'm sorry it couldn't have been sooner.
7	1	Thank you, Ethel.
8	2	Thanks to that, we'll be able to\nmake it through to Ribbi Flats.
9	4	Colony 4's engineers are excellent.\nThey took care of that faster than\nI thought they would.
10	3	I guess we'll be saying\nbye-bye to Colony 4.
11	5	We owe you, Ethel.
12	7	No... It is I who's indebted to you.
13	7	If you can spare the time, you ought to\ncall in on Bolearis.
14	7	He's really taken a liking to all of you.
15	6	Cool. Yeah, we'll go see him.
16	7	Also... There's something I need\nto tell you all before you depart.
17	7	There are many prying eyes and\nhungry ears here. We should take\nthis into Command.
18	1	Understood.
evt/fev/msg_fev03105010.json
0		Once you enter the office, you'll be\nunable to include Ethel in the party.
1		Progress the main story?
2		Yes
3		No
evt/fev/msg_fev03110010.json
0	4	We should check the route data again.\nMake sure we're on the right path.
1	4	We're on course for Swordmarch.
2	4	But first we'll need to take the\nsouth-east road through Ribbi Flats.
3	1	Ah, yes. That's the route that Ethel\nrecommended.
4	4	Correct.
5	2	She said the battlefronts are pretty static\nat the moment. But do we have any intel\nabout colony deployment?
6	3	As far as Ethel and Colony 4 is concerned,\nwe've got a pretty good idea... But what\nabout any others?
7	5	I wouldn't expect any shenanigans\nall the way out here...
8	1	In any case, we mustn't let our\nguard down along the way.
9	4	Danger could be lurking anywhere in\nthe background, so insecurity stalks us...\nNot much we can do about that though.
10	5	Ah, c'mon man. We'll muddle through.
11	4	Let's hope so.
12	1	Hey, I mean, if we run into another colony,\nit isn't necessarily a bad thing.
13	5	Uhh... Are you sure about that?
14	5	It doesn't matter if we run into Agnus\nor Keves. Either one would mean getting\ninto a dust-up.
15	1	True, but what I meant was... If we\ndestroyed their Flame Clock, we'd set\neveryone free, like we did for Colony 4.
16	3	Easy to say...
17	1	Well, sure, I mean...if conditions allow it.
18	4	If we're "brushing off embers",\nwe'll have no choice in the matter.
19	2	...That's right.
20	3	Hey, maybe it's better if we put off\nworrying about that until the time comes.
21	5	Eunie's speaking sense there.
22	2	True. We can just react to events\nas they happen. Play it by ear.
23	6	Gotcha! I'll apply myself to that!
evt/fev/msg_fev03115010.json
0	3	Hey! Over there!
1	3	If we set up camp there, we'll have good\nvisibility. Think it's time we took a break?
2	8	Riku, for one, want to rest, anyway!
3	8	Relentless walking has left legs\nlike numbed-out sausages...
4	9	Sausages indeed! Mealtime is here!
5	2	Sounds good.
6	2	Let's go for it, I say.\nShould we rest in shifts?
7	2	I can take sentry duty first.
8	6	Ah, Mimi! Let me back you up on that!
9	1	OK!
10	1	Then let's take a break there.
evt/fev/msg_fev03200010.json
0	4	Everybody, listen up.
1	4	We've entered Colony Lambda's territory.\nThat means that the probability of our\nencountering Agnus forces is very high.
2	4	Before we get any closer to their\npatrolled zone, we should prepare\nourselves by resting.
3	1	No objections here.
4	2	Or here. Let's go with Taion's plan!
evt/fev/msg_fev03325010.json
0	8	Everybody flat on ground...
1	6	At least they're breathing!
2	9	Friends all OK?
3	5	Looks like they're just passed out.
4	1	Even so... There's cause for concern.
5	3	Taion!
6	4	...Uh?
7	3	We need to find the\nreal commander, right?
8	2	We'll keep an eye on this place.\nYou go and make sure Commander\nIsurd is safe.
9	4	Wait, but...
10	4	...No, sorry, you're right.\nI'll go now, be back soon!
evt/fev/msg_fev03325015.json
0	4	Commander Isurd!
1	4	...It's good to see you.
evt/fev/msg_fev03330010.json
0	2	How's Commander Isurd?
1	4	It sounds like he's eager to jump\nback into work. I do wish he'd rest up\nfirst, but... That's the kind of man he is.
2	6	...Ah, um, good to hear he's\nfeeling well, at least...
3	1	The other soldiers are waking up, too.
4	4	Very interesting.
5	5	Someone should bring them up to speed,\nbut we're just outsiders, after all...
6	5	This is your manor, right?\nYou should do the honors\nand fill everyone in.
7	4	That is being taken care of.
8	4	Commander Isurd is going to get\nthe colony troops back in line shortly.
9	3	OK... So, it sounds like it's fine for us\nto just walk around like normal then.
10	1	On that note, there's something\nI'd like to check.
11	2	Taion, will you come along?
12	4	...Huh...? Sure. Where are we going?
13	2	Out of Colony Lambda.
evt/fev/msg_fev03500100.json
0	3	So that's Colony 30's Flame Clock\nwe've busted up now too...
1	5	Yeah. If we keep this up, I bet you the\nConsuls are gonna get real up in arms.
2	4	...We'll be lucky if that's all that happens.
3	6	What do you mean?
4	2	...You think we might not be the only\nones in their firing line, is that it?
5	4	If the Consuls see escape from the\nFlame Clock's dominion as an act\nof rebellion...
6	1	...Then soldiers from the liberated colonies\nmight be in just as much danger as us...?
7	3	Then it looks like we can't just smash\ntheir Clocks and leave them to it...
8	6	We can defend them all, I'm sure!\nWith the power of Ouroboros on our side,\nthere's nothing we can't do.
9	5	Yeah, no, see, there's still only six of us.\nWe can't be everywhere at once, right?
10	2	Well, but even if we can't protect everyone\nat all times, we can certainly at least help\nthem out in various ways...
11	6	Oh, like we did at Colony 4?
12	1	We may have a long road ahead of us,\nbut in a very real sense, so do they.
13	1	I think it's important that we work together\nto forge bonds of trust and cooperation.
14	4	...Yes, well, that's all well and good,\nbut I can hardly imagine them opening\ntheir hearts and souls to us that easily.
15	5	It makes sense though surely?\nAnybody'll clam right up if you\ncome on too hard.
16	3	Might be smartest to keep an ear to the\ngrapevine as we go, make sure to talk with\nfolks and keep up with the gossip.
17	3	That way we might hear about any troubles\nthey might have, or whatever, and discover\nthings that we can help with.
18	1	I like Eunie's plan. It's simple and direct.
19	6	Well then, no time like the present!\nLet's go and find some people to talk to\nat the colony!
evt/fev/msg_fev03500200.json
0	3	Right, I think that's pretty much\nall the relevant news we can find.
1	4	It seems the problems are far more\nprevalent than we'd anticipated.
2	5	Tell me about it.\nSo? What's our next step?
3	4	I think we could do a lot of good here by\nhelping out, but ultimately, our destination\nis Swordmarch. That's important too.
4	1	You're right. We should consider things\nfrom all angles before we act...
evt/fev/msg_fev04020010.json
0	5	Ready to go!
1	1	OK, then let's go.
2	8	How we go on from here?
3	3	I got completely turned around in all those\nsparking tunnels, and then the joyride down\nthose rapids...
4	3	I've got to say, I have absolutely\nno sparking clue where we are.
5	4	You needn't worry on that count.
6	4	Commander Isurd provided us with the\nnecessary topographical data.
7	3	Oh, nice! Legend.
8	4	All the water that runs from the Urayan\nmountains makes for difficult terrain.
9	4	Actually, rather than constantly checking\nthe data and explaining myself, I think it'd\nbe better if I just tell you where to go...
10	5	Yeah, sounds good. Lead the way!
11	6	Totes! We have every faith in you, Taion!
12	4	This is the bottom of the waterfall.\nLet's see if we can get to the\nmiddle levels first.
13	1	Should we aim to get above Colony Lambda?
14	4	Basically, yes.
15	4	To get to the middle levels, we'll need to\nhead up and around.
16	1	Got it.
17	9	Departure time!
18	2	Did you get to say everything you wanted\nto say to Commander Isurd in the end?
19	4	...More or less.
20	2	Well... OK, that's good.
21	4	Let's go.
evt/fev/msg_fev04050010.json
0	1	Are you tired?
1	2	A bit. That last monster\nwas really something.
2	2	But I can deal with it.
3	4	Yes, well. In that last battle we all\noverused our Ouroboros abilities...
4	4	I want to avoid Interlinking\nagain for a while.
5	1	...Good shout.
6	5	Couldn't we keep going,\njust without Interlinking?
7	4	That comes with its own risks. Small,\nbut risks nonetheless. I'm just asking you\nto keep it in mind.
8	5	Sure, whatever...
9	1	Shall we find somewhere\nto have a quick rest, then?
10	4	It appears there should be a good\nplace to take a break up ahead.
11	1	We'll regroup once we get there.
12	3	Roger that, boss!
evt/fev/msg_fev04115010.json
0	9	Everyone! Is emergency!
1	6	What's up, Manana?
2	9	Manana cannot.
3	9	Manana cannot go on\nlike this one extra step.
4	1	We have been walking since Colony Tau,\nI suppose... If we can find a good place,\nwe'll set up camp, OK?
5	9	Meh! Plan need more dinner!
6	6	You can be strong a little longer,\ncan't you, huh? Just a little?
7	9	Fine!
8	9	But Manana very very starving today.
9	9	We need make dinner soon,\nand everyone must help cook!
10	2	Sure, we'll all be happy to chip in.\nRight, guys?
evt/fev/msg_fev04245010.json
0	3	Er, are we really going this way?
1	5	I can't see any other way\nto the Castle, can you?
2	1	I don't want to drag our feet getting there.\nBe careful crossing though, yeah?
3	3	Are you joking me.
4	6	Afraid of heights, huh?
5	3	Not afraid as such, but if we fell\nfrom here, we'd, like, die? Instantly?!
6	9	If Manana think something tasty waiting on\nother side, then Manana can be brave.
7	4	If we can make it across, we'll\nalmost be out of Maktha Wildwood.
8	2	Just one more hop to Keves Castle.
9	1	We'll probably have quite a\ngood view of it from over there.
10	3	Fine, fine, I get it!\nLet's just get this over with!
evt/fev/msg_fev04360010.json
0	qm1	Hurry up and load the stuff going\nto Colony 5 into the transport.
1	qm1	And that stuff is going to the Castle.
2	1	Hear that? They're going to the Castle.
3	4	Let's hide in that container.
4	qm1	OK, start loading.
evt/fev/msg_fev05030010.json
0	3	...Can you believe we've\njust had to run all that way?
1	4	I don't know who they were, but had that\nforce not intervened... I shudder to think\nwhat would have happened.
2	3	What would have happened was,\nit would have been curtains for us.
3	4	Usually a strategy is something you're\nsupposed to prepare beforehand.
4	1	...
5	5	Noah?
6	5	I guess we have no more\nuse for Castles and Queens, huh.
7	3	We're not going back,\nI know that much.
8	2	Nope, we're going\nforward now.
9	1	...You're right.
10	1	Not far now before we reach Swordmarch.
11	1	Let's go.
evt/fev/msg_fev05040010.json
0	9	Levnis from earlier disappeared in sky.
1	D	Yep. Oh, and before we take you\nto the City, you have to wear these.
2	1	Eyepatches?
3	D	They're the same as the ones we wear.
4	D	Put them over the eye\nwhere your Iris is.
5	D	What? They won't hurt you.
6	D	Thanks for the cooperation.\nWe appreciate this.
7	D	So. I said we aren't hostile,\nbut that might not be enough\nto earn your trust, I'm guessing.
8	D	If it lays your fears to rest, you can\ntreat me as your prisoner until we\nreach the City.
9	1	Huh...?
10	3	Yeah, that doesn't sound right, darlin'.
11	D	Don't want a prisoner?\nWhatever, I'll be your escort then.
12	D	I should point out, you won't find anyone\nbetter with a mace in the Lost Numbers.
13	5	Yeah, well, don't bash us\nabout with it or anything.
14	D	If I wanted to, then your\nattitude would have earned\nyou a thrashing already.
15	D	So, let's be on our way.\nShania'll show you how to go.
16		Monica has temporarily\njoined the party.
evt/fev/msg_fev05040020.json
0	5	...And how are we meant to\nget to the City from here?
1	6	Um yeah, this is a dead end.
2	D	Wrong.
3	9	Meh?!
4	3	A door!
5	D	This leads into the Great Sword.\nThe City's this way.
6	4	What a masterful disguise.
7	2	Huh. When Ethel said there was\nnothing of interest in the Swordmarch...
8	1	Guess she never found this.
9	hW1	Hey, you guys done?\nCan we get going?
evt/fev/msg_fev05070110.json
0	D	You can take the eyepatches off now.\nWon't need them past this point.
1	1	O-oh, right... And you're sure about that?
2	D	The City's got some signal-jamming tech\nthat functions just like the eyepatches,\nblocking detection by Moebius.
3	D	We're safe inside. You have my word.
4	4	I suppose that must be the reason\nwhy they haven't been able to discover\nthe City thus far.
5	D	You got that right. This place is our last\nredoubt, and our sole haven in this world.
6	D	But as soon as we step outside, Moebius\nare all over us, like a bad wool sweater.
7	D	So what I'm saying is, don't forget your\neyepatches when you're out and about.\nThat's all.
8	1	I hear you, loud and clear. We'll remember.
evt/fev/msg_fev05160010.json
0	D	Shania.
1	8	More walking to do?
2	D	This is the last stretch.
3	D	Let's get you to the dorms.
evt/fev/msg_fev05160020.json
0	D	This is the dorm for young\nLost Numbers soldiers.
1	D	You can sleep here\nwhile you're in the City.
2	D	You can ask that guy about your rooms.
3	D	Oh, and sadly there's no\nkitchen in the building.
4	D	A lot of the single soldiers\neat at the Michiba Canteen.
5	D	But if you want to do your own\ncooking, feel free to use that\nempty plot of land over there.
6	1	Got it. Thank you, Monica.
7	D	Tomorrow we have\na lot to discuss.
8	1	Agreed. How shall we arrange that?
9	D	Meet me in the Lost Numbers\nwar room.
10	D	It's the place down the lift from near\nthe Praetorian Hill which we passed\non the way here.
11	D	I'll let you know closer to the time.
12	D	Oh, before I forget.
13	D	You're free to explore\nthe City as you will.
14	2	Is that really OK?
15	D	I said we weren't hostile, right?
16	D	I thought you'd be pleased not to\nhave me breathing down your necks.
17	1	No, we're grateful.
18	1	Thanks for everything.
evt/fev/msg_fev05175010.json
0	5	Wow, soft beds are really\ncomfy. Who knew?
1	1	I'm fairly sure you've always slept well,\neven in sleeping bags.
2	3	Same.
3	4	You lot... Weren't you even\na little nervous?
4	5	Clearly you were nervous enough\nfor all of us, judging by those\ndark circles under your eyes.
5	4	I couldn't just meekly go to sleep after\ngetting here and processing all that\ninformation.
6	3	That sounds more like excitement\nthan nerves, if you ask me...
7	2	Well, it looks like last night's\njumble of information will be\nsorted out in the war room.
8	1	Right.
9	4	...We should probably start making a move\nover to the war room, then.
10	1	Right, agreed.
11	6	Monica said-
12	2	You take the lift down from near\nby the Praetorian Hill, right?\nThat's the sword's hilt guard...
13	3	All the way there, huh...?
14	3	OK then.
15	6	Yep!
evt/fev/msg_fev05180010.json
0	yl1	Mr. Samon's engineering department?\nGo down the lift near Dolgan Cliff and\nyou'll find it in no time.
1	yl1	It's the big lift you took to get\nup here. You know the one?
2	1	Right.
3	yl1	Welp, that's it! Ciao!
4	5	Oh what, you're not gonna\nshow us the way?
5	vl1	There's a strategy meeting we\nhave to be at, discussing what\nto do after the infiltration.
6	2	Oh, you're infiltrating\nthe prison too?
7	vl1	Well, it was originally *our* plan.
8	1	I see.
9	1	Looking forward to working with you, then.
10	vl1	Yeah, sorry, not going to be\nall buddy-buddy with you.
11	3	Wow, what crawled up his arse?
12	4	Look at it from their perspective.\nWe essentially took the Ouroboros powers\nthat were originally intended for them.
13	6	But...
14	5	What does that have\nto do with any of this?
15	1	Let's just play our part for now.
16	1	We should head to engineering.
evt/fev/msg_fev05200010.json
0	5	Did we hear from Monica?
1	1	Yeah. The ship's ready.
2	D	The ship's ready.
3	2	Mr. Samon must have\npulled an all-nighter.
4	3	It's all going to kick off soon.
5	4	Our preparations should also\nbe complete. Let's rendezvous\nwith Mr. Samon at the port.
6	2	Let's.
evt/fev/msg_fev05200020.json
0	gl1	I been waiting for you!\nShip is steady-ready.
1	D	OK, I'm counting on you to\nbust out and bring back Ghondor.
2	3	You're counting on us?\nCount on yourself - you're\ncoming too, aren't you?
3	D	I'll be accompanying you on the trip,\nbut I'm leaving the actual prison\ninfiltration up to you.
4	D	This isn't the Lost Numbers'\nonly job right now, you know.
5	D	I think you should be plenty capable\nof carrying it out yourselves, but if\nyou want me there, I'll go with you.
6	D	Just for the journey, mind.\nThe infiltration is your job.
7	D	This isn't the Lost Numbers'\nonly job right now, you know.
8	D	Jansen, you're in\ncharge of the infiltration.
9	vl1	Understood.
10	vl1	Try not to drag us\ndown, Ouroboros.
11	5	Worry about yourself.
12	D	Samon, tell us the route.
13	gl1	Meh!
14	gl1	Me-hem!
15	gl1	As said before, you cross along\nErythia Sea on good ship Boundary, then\ngo to prison direct underneath Castle.
16	3	Ah, good. Right through the fog.
17	gl1	But! Here is detail\nof importance.
18	gl1	Even if all get there without\nbumps and bruises, island is\nsurrounded by tall cliff on all side!
19	gl1	Boundary only run over water...\nAfter that, friends will need proceed\nunder own strength.
20	6	So we just have to do our best\nto climb up the cliffs without\ngetting rumbled?
21	4	If we can climb up them just by\ndoing our best then that's great, but...
22	D	First, it can't be done.
23	2	If the prison's in Agnus Castle, then\nit's going to be more heavily guarded\nthan any old Colony.
24	D	Right on the money.
25	D	Before we head for the prison,\nlet's rendezvous with a soldier\nhiding on nearby Vinisog Holm.
26	D	Before you head for the prison,\nrendezvous with a soldier\nhiding on nearby Vinisog Holm.
27	D	Her name's Kisame. She's the only soldier\nwho managed to escape from Hope's Rest.
28	4	If we learn about how she managed\nto escape, we can use that information\nin our infiltration, is that right?
29	D	Vinisog Holm is on the way anyway, so\nrather than fiddle with janky comms, I\nthought it'd be best to go there and chat.
30	1	Yeah, makes sense.
31	D	Right, let's be off.
32	D	That's all I've got to say.\nGet everything ready for departure.
33	1	OK.
34	gl1	All righty-doodles,\ngoodest of luck to friends.
35	5	Wait, are you not\npiloting us, Mr. Samon?
36	gl1	Samon is tired after long night of work.\nPlease to not overwork poor Samon.
37	2	So who is our pilot, then...?
38	gl1	Pilot is inside you all along! Samon can\nsend information of direction to any Iris, so\nanyone who want to pilot can fulfill dream.
39	gl1	But however, if break Boundary,\nis punishable by megaspankings.
40	5	Yeah, yeah, we get it.
41	8	...Fine, fine, Riku will\nvolunteer for pilot.
42	1	Is that OK?
43	8	Is easier than\nworking Levnis.
44	1	Riku was our mechanic\nback in the colony.
45	1	He's good with stuff like this.\nI trust him to lead us right.
46	D	Can I trust you not to let me down?
47	8	Meh! Riku make it smooth sailing.
48	vl1	Sure it'll be fine.
49	9	Will do our best!
50	1	This Ghondor person in prison is\nour key to finding the whereabouts\nof the true Queens.
51	2	We have to pull this off.

0	8	We can leave\nat any time.
1	3	Let's get on with it then.
2	3	Got my identification device on.
3	4	Once we're inside the prison,\nwe won't be able to come\nback out again for a while.
4	4	We must be absolutely sure\nthat we're ready for anything.
5		Infiltrate the prison?
6		Yes
7		No
8	1	Let's go.
9	D	OK, the rest is up to you.\nI'll get back to the City.
10	2	Thank you for all you've done.
11	vl1	We'll do our best to see\nthis mission through.
12	1	Let's give everything another\nonce-over before we set off.
13	3	Let's smash it!
14		Monica is staying in the City to lead\nthe Lost Numbers and won't be able\nto join the party for a while.
evt/fev/msg_fev05330010.json
0	1	...OK, got it. Stay safe\non your end too.
1	1	Jansen and the others are all\nin the same cell, it looks like.
2	4	If they didn't notice us\ncoming in from the outside...
3	4	...I think we can call step\none of the plan a success.
4	2	I wonder how we're supposed to get\nGhondor to work with us...
5	1	Yeah.
6	1	The way she said we were "trying to\nkill the now"... Sounded like she might\ntake some convincing.
7	3	Yeah, and what the spark\ndoes that even mean?
8	1	I've no idea.
9	1	But I think I want to\nask Ghondor about it.\nLots to talk about.
10	5	Talk? Dude, I'm not looking forward\nto raising a merry ruckus just to get out...
11	8	That seem not strictly necessary.
12	6	What d'you mean...?
13	pm1	You're new around here, eh?\nIf you don't stir yourself,\nyou'll miss grub, you know.
14	9	They even feed us?!
15	4	Well now. Seems we have more freedom\nthan we initially assumed, here.
16	1	Let's look for Ghondor.
evt/fev/msg_fev05335010.json
0	Q	We're done today.\nScuttle back to your hole,\nyou rat bastards.
1	Q	If we keep crowding together like this,\na nice Mr. Jailer might show up and\nrattle your empty heads together.
2	1	No worries, we'll clear out.
3	Q	Ah, before you go, just\none more word to the wise...
4	Q	If you're gonna pretend to be model\nprisoners, you'd better put some effort\ninto the jobs the guards give you.
5	2	What kinds of jobs are they?
6	Q	Hmm. It's different depending on the day.
7	Q	Anyway, come here\nagain in the morning.
8	1	We'll be here.
9	9	We have to wake up early?
10	6	Looks that way, sweetie.
11	8	Noah, would be good idea to sleep\nearly today. Early to sleeping,\nearly to waking.
12	1	Right.
evt/fev/msg_fev05340010.json
0	1	Is everyone ready?
1	5	Oh yeah.
2	2	Ghondor told us to\ngo to the central cell block.
3	4	It's about the same time now as it was\nwhen we infiltrated the prison...
4	3	Ugh, what if that foul-mouthed\njailer's there...?
5	4	He'll no doubt be at the morning gathering.
6	5	OK then. Shall we go, my\nfellow model prisoners?
7	6	Good luck at hard labor, everyone!
8	3	Ugh, hope we get off lightly...
evt/fev/msg_fev05340030.json
0	2	Good morning. Everything's ready.
1	1	Then let's get to the central cell block.
2	3	Let's all give our best to the ol'\npenal colony again today, mateys.
3	6	Hahaha...
4	5	That Ghondor certainly enjoys skiving off,\nconsidering how insistent she was that\nwe keep our heads down.
5	4	Actually, if I recall correctly, she said\nto "pretend to be model prisoners".
6	1	Whatever we do, we have\none more day of it.
evt/fev/msg_fev05380010.json
0	6	So, today's the day we\nbreak out of here, huh.
1	2	Is everyone ready?
2	9	Manana take many-many rest\nso that can run flashy-dashy!
3	4	The time that Ghondor specified is\nafter the beginning of outdoor work.
4	1	We should keep our heads down\nand work until she gives the signal.
5	3	Ughhh, we'll have to listen\nto that shitehawk again at\nthe morning assembly.
6	5	Last time, though.
7	8	Friends stay concentrated.
8	1	Right. Time to get everything\ntogether for the escape.
9	1	When we're all sorted,\nlet's go to the central cell block.
evt/fev/msg_fev05390010.json
0	1	Ghondor!
1	Q	Took your time, didn't ya?
2	6	Wow, you sure didn't waste any...!
3	Q	No time for chitchat. My friends are\ngonna cause a distraction, and we're\ngonna make a run for the west gate.
4	2	It looks like quite a few\npeople are fighting already.
5	Q	Good, then they can have\nanother brawl later.
6	Q	I'll take the lead, all right?
7	Q	Let's dance, bitches!
8		Ghondor has temporarily\njoined the party.
evt/fev/msg_fev05390020.json
0	1	Reinforcements?!
1	Q	Eyes on the prize!
2	Q	Boot these arseholes out of the way\nand the west gate is in our sights!
evt/fev/msg_fev05999010.json
0	4	I think this is the place.
1	4	If we break through this wall...
2	5	...we can get outside, right?
3	5	All right. Sena, we're up.
4	6	Got it. I'm with you.
evt/fev/msg_fev05999020.json
0	1	Two guards...
1	5	Probably shouldn't just\nforce our way through, eh?
2	1	Agreed... Let's look for another place.
evt/fev/msg_fev05999030.json
0	1	Lots of guards here...
1	3	Bah, just our luck...\nLet's go somewhere else, then.
evt/fev/msg_fev05999040.json
0	1	This is...a warehouse of some kind?
1	4	According to the schematics,\nthat's what it is.
2	4	What do you think, Noah?\nThere are no guards, so we\nshould be able to proceed...
3	1	You're right, seems safe enough.\nLet's get down through here.
4	5	Hold up. Shouldn't we be\ntaking off our eyepatches?
5	5	Far as I can tell, the people being held\nin here don't have them on.
6	3	Makes sense.
evt/fev/msg_fev06220010.json
0	Q	Where are you going?
1	2	Just over there, to Hope's Rest.\nI'll be back soon.
2	2	The other "me" had something\nshe wanted Noah to see.
3	Q	He's gonna see *that*?
4	Q	Yeah, I'm coming too.
5	2	What?
6	Q	Come on. Let's go.
7	Q	Hope's Rest is a summer\nstroll from here.
8	Q	Just get off the transport Levnis,\nsaunter out of the west gate...
9	Q	...then keep going till you see\nthe hill with a sea view.
10	Q	Easy-peasy, eh?
11	2	Yes.
12	2	OK, let's go.
evt/fev/msg_fev06223010.json
0	Q	Before we blast Z to his\njust deserts, first we have to\nfind the Queen of Agnus, right?
1	1	Right.
2	2	But I'm not sure right now is-
3	5	What's this, you worried about us?
4	2	I mean... You were all locked\nin a prison cell for all that time...
5	2	And you're still hurt from\nthe fight with N...
6	3	Oh whatever, all we need\nis a bit of exercise and a stretch.\nGet that good blood pumping.
7	Q	Oh yeah?\nWell, am I ever pleased to hear that.
8	Q	If you can move, then help clean up\nthe square you went mental on.
9	1	Ah, yes, we probably should.
10	Q	Then it's a deal!
11	Q	I'm heading back to the\nCastle, so get a shift on.
12	1	OK.
13	2	...Noah?
14	1	Let's go.
evt/fev/msg_fev06235010.json
0	5	Phew, all done and dusted.
1	Q	Good work, team.
2	6	All squeaky clean!
3	4	We leave tomorrow, correct?
4	3	Yeah, so let's take it easy\nfor the rest of today.
5	8	Meh, but where can it be easily taken?
6	Q	Good question, the Castle's swarming\nwith Agnus soldiers and Lost Numbers.
7	Q	If you aren't fussed about fancy bedding,\nthere's a guard station in that building\nyou can lie down in.
8	8	Is better than cage cell.
evt/fev/msg_fev06255010.json
0	1	We can't do anything about this now,\nbut we can't forget about Cammuravi\nand the others.
1	3	Yeah, they must be\npretty bamboozled.
2	1	There is that, but also, they're\nsupposed to be dead.
3	1	Even if they wake up, they can't\ngo back to their own colonies.
4	4	Should we discuss this with Travis?
5	4	If they're in the City, we don't\nhave to worry about them bumping\ninto old friends...
6	4	And Moebius wouldn't be able to\nmess with them too easily, either.
7	1	...OK then.
8	tk106tk10	Hey, how are things?
9	10310	We actually wanted to\ntalk to you, if that's OK...
10	tk104tk10	More ridiculous tech, eh? Oof.
11	10310	We destroyed their Flame Clock, so\nwe shouldn't have to worry about\nthe colony. But on the other hand...
12	tk104tk10	Right, what comes next for your\nfriends is a different matter.
13	tk104tk10	I get it. I'll send some guys over\nas soon as I get the chance.
14	tk104tk10	There's a crew on a\nscavenger mission close by.
15	10310	Thanks. That's a big help.
16	10310	We are planning on going\nto the Cloudkeep next.
17	tk108tk10	Gotcha.
18	4	Worried about something?
19	6	Just wondering if they'll know\nto see the City people as allies...
20	6	Gah, sorry, that was\na weird thing to say.
21	6	Anyway, we made it this far,\nso let's hurry to the Cloudkeep!
evt/fev/msg_fev07080010.json

11	3	Yeahhh, Mr. Samon, we don't really\nget all your technical talk...

13	5	That's fine, right?
14	8	Oh, this very fine, yes...
15	gl1	Samon have calculate optimum\nroute for throwing ship at vortex.
16	gl1	Waters around Farview Cape\nare good. Samon send precise\ncoordinates, friends verify later.
17	2	You'd do all of that for us?
18	2	Mr. Samon, thank you so much.\nWithout you, we wouldn't be\nable to join the battle.

0	3	What the spark were those things?!
1	3	They fall apart the moment\nwe take 'em down...
2	6	The black fog is gone too...
3	4	They're not mechanical...
4	4	But neither are they biological.
5	1	Something wrong, Mio?
6	2	Mm...
7	2	As they fell, I could feel it,\nvery slightly...
8	2	A vague whiff of Moebius\ncoming off them.
9	3	Those things?
10	3	What's that mean?
11	2	I'm not sure...
12	1	Mio, didn't you say before\nall this could be Moebius?
13	2	Yeah.
14	4	Are you trying to say those things\nmight be Moebius as well?
15	5	But they don't even look human.
16	1	I think the shape might not\nmatter so much.
17	5	Huh?
18	1	I think I'm starting to get the picture.
19	1	I feel like I know what Moebius is...

evt/nq/msg_nq000115t.json
0	oi1	Meh! Who this?!
1	5	Hey hey, no need for\nviolence, all right?! We\naren't your enemies.
2	oi1	Tamtam is expert in path of\nwarrior. Can easily fend off\nattackers with martial ways!
3	5	I'm sure you can, but we're\nhere to help Shillshill make\nsome register thing...?
4	oi1	Oh, Tamtam see...
5	oi1	Friends were close to feeling\npower of secret death move\nof Tamtam! But have stone.
6	oi1	Tamtam see hundred weak\npoints in your defense, like\nMiimo, so be careful.
7	5	...Thanks for the advice,\nmate.
evt/nq/msg_nq000116t.json
0	pi1	Hello, what friends need?
1	1	We're helping Shillshill\nmake a register. She\nwanted some stones too...
2	pi1	Oh, that right! Have this one!\nNice blue stone of Selfifi.
3	1	Thanks, that's great.
4	pi1	Friends meet Aggroro already?\nAggroro very disagreeable. Try\nnot become enemy of Aggroro!
5	1	Oh... OK... We'll try.\nThanks!
evt/nq/msg_nq000117t.json
0	4	We're here at Shillshill's request.\nDo you have a stone for her?
1	qi1	Ah, that time is come. Hm,\nwhere is stone of mine gone?\nCannot remember...
2	4	We're supposed to be collecting\nthem for her.
3	qi1	Ahh, Hazidazi only have red stone...\nBut have forgotten meaning behind it.\nFriends happy to take anyway?
4	4	As long as it's a stone,\nthe particulars are unimportant.
5	qi1	Shillshill must be real busy if\nask help from human people.
6	qi1	There some scaredy-pon like\nMemomemo out there, so keep\nsome peeled eyes handy.
7	4	...We will.
evt/nq/msg_nq000118t.json
0	ri1	Who this and what you want?
1	6	We're here to pick up a stone\nand make a register!
2	ri1	This Shillshill thing, yes?\nHere is stone for you.
3	ri1	Stone of Loloka is yellow.\nLoloka find that relationship with\nhumans is very important.
4	6	Y-yeah? OK, thank you!
5	ri1	Stone very important. Ruggyscruggy\nprobably lost his. Sloppy Nopon.
6	ri1	Well, whatever. Please take\nthis to Shillshill.
7	6	Got it, thanks!
evt/nq/msg_nq000119t.json
0	1	We've come on behalf of Shillshill.\nDid she give you a stone? We're\nhere to take it back to her.
1	WZ1	Stone? Oh...
2	WZ1	Stone is lost!
3	2	Oh, what?!
4	WZ1	Momama was sleeping in tall tree, and\nit fall down, never again to be seen!
5	WZ1	Friends can tell this to Shillshill!
6	2	We can, but is it OK\nto go without taking\na stone back?
7	WZ1	It annoying hassle, so is OK. Shillshill is\nmajorly serious Nopon, so probably she\nget angry. Oh well!
8	1	R-right. We'll just go tell her then...
evt/nq/msg_nq000120t.json
0	1	We managed to find everyone,\nand here are the stones we got.
1	zY1	Ahh, Shillshill was right to put\nfaith in friends. Very helpful.
2	3	So, what did we even collect\nthese things for? Everyone\ngave us something different.
3	zY1	Ah, that a story.
4	zY1	These stones are rock solid test of intent!
5	5	...Huh.
6	zY1	Pun not intended!
7	5	What is she on about?
8	zY1	Ahem! Back to topic.
9	zY1	It good test for Nopon caravans\non how to be friendly with humans.\nShillshill test every so often.
10	6	Wow, really?
11	zY1	Red is keeping distance.\nBlue is status quo.\nYellow is for harmony.
12	zY1	This way Nopon keep good balance\nof distance with humans.
13	1	I knew it, those colors\ndid have meanings.
14	zY1	Very essential thing for caravans.
15	2	So what were the results this time?
16	zY1	Let Shillshill see...
17	zY1	Six of blue, six of yellow and seven of red.
18	zY1	It look like caravans who think\nhumans should be at distance\nhave slightly increased.
19	6	Oh...
20	zY1	That life. Sometimes\nresults are like this.
21	zY1	This not mean we fight with humans\nall of the sudden! Please not to worry.
22	6	Um. If you say so?
23	zY1	Thank you for help!\nPlease come back again!
24	zY1	Six of red, six of yellow and seven of blue.
25	zY1	That make sense. No change\nin situation of human relation.
26	4	Is that...good?
27	zY1	Eh, not good, not bad.\nIt only agreement to keep\nrelationship going.
28	1	At least it means there's no hostility\nbetween us. That's something, right?
29	4	Hmm. I see.
30	zY1	Thank you for help!\nPlease come back again!
31	zY1	Six of red, six of blue and seven of yellow.
32	zY1	That mean there more Nopon\nwho think it better to keep close\nwith humans.
33	2	What does that mean?
34	zY1	It mean slice prices across all franchises\nclean in half, to encourage uptake of trade\nfrom more human people than ever before.
35	3	In half?!\nWow, that's seriously generous.
36	zY1	However, preparation for implement such\nsweeping policy change will take about\nfive year or so, so Shillshill ask patience.
37	3	...
38	1	...Well, in any case, having the Nopon\nbe friendlier with us is really a win\nin itself, I suppose.
39	zY1	Exactly! Exactly.
40	zY1	So with all that said, please continue to\nuse Nopon Caravan for all friends' daily\nshopping needs!

0	3	About those guys from Colony 9...
1	3	They've really been coming at Noah\nasking for off-seeings these days.
2	5	I thought they had a new off-seer\nfilling in for him?
3	5	What's his name...?
4	I	Url, a fourth-termer.
5	XW1	Is fourth-term Url.
6	5	Yeah, that's the one.
7	5	I guess he's just not as\nreliable as our Noah.
8	5	He'd been doing the off-seeing until\nwe got back to Colony 9, hadn't he?
9	1	...
10	1	I don't really mind sending\nthem off. But still...
11	3	It just ain't possible for you\nto do the sending-off in this\nfella's place every time.
12	1	I wonder how things\ngot to this point.
13	I	I've been wanting to look into this too.
14	I	We need to talk to Roald. He'll have\na good overview on what's going on\nwith the soldiers.
15	I	Let's meet up with him in the Colony 9\nBarracks and see what's going on.
16	3	Should we find someone\nwho knows what's up?
17	3	There must be someone we can\ncollar in the Colony 9 Barracks.
18	1	Yeah, probably.
evt/nq/msg_nq010101t.json
0	1	We wanted to ask about Url.\nHow he's doing, that sort of thing.
1	hX1	Ooh, Url?
2	hX1	Actually, I was wondering if it was\nsomething I should report to Zeon...
3	hX1	The colony isn't happy because Url\ndoesn't want to do any off-seeing.
4	1	I mean, an off-seer who doesn't want\nto do off-seeing? What's up with that?
5	hX1	Well, to be more precise, he's stopped\ndoing it while everyone is present.
6	hX1	His guard, Carrie, said\nas much, anyway.
7	hX1	No one's seen hide or hair of\nhim today either, so he's\nprobably doing an off-seeing.
8	1	Has he been avoiding the public eye?
9	1	Do you know where Url is now?
10	hX1	I think he's on Viliera Hill.\nEilis reported finding the\nhusk of a friend there.
11	1	OK, thank you.
12	I	I'd like to ask Url himself what's going on.
13	5	Shall we go and ask him about it?
14	1	Yeah, let's go to Viliera Hill.
evt/nq/msg_nq010102t.json
0	1	Carrie, where's Url? Isn't he with you?
1	YX1	Thank the flames you're here.\nCould you help look for him?
2	1	Has something happened?
3	YX1	We came out to send off\na friend who died in battle.
4	YX1	Eilis and Lenny shouted\nto me for something.
5	YX1	He must have wandered off\nwhile we were talking.
6	YX1	Even when he played the off-seeing\nmelody, there were no motes like\nyou usually get.
7	YX1	I think he was embarrassed\nthat Eilis and Lenny had seen it.
8	1	No off-seeing motes? I wonder if that's\nthe reason he hasn't been wanting to do it.
9	YX1	Please, will you find him for me?
10	YX1	Please help Eilis and Lenny. Eilis is to the\neast of Viliera Hill, near the Millick Meadows\nwaterfall and Lenny's at Kamos Guidepost.
11	1	OK. We'll let you know\nas soon as we find him.
12	YX1	Url isn't responding to\nour communications.
13	YX1	Some kind of guard I've turned out to be!\nI don't even know where he is...
evt/nq/msg_nq010103t.json
0	1	Eilis! You...don't seem\nto have found Url.
1	aX1	Ah, you've come to help find him?
2	aX1	Yeah. Carrie's out of her mind with\nworry. I don't know what to do...
3	aX1	Whenever anything happened he'd\nsay he didn't want people to die.
4	aX1	Hopefully he's just off\ncollecting Fourtune Clovers.
5	aX1	I was thinking that I should check whether\nUrl was really sending people off properly.
6	aX1	But I never imagined that he'd\nsomehow lost the ability to off-see...
7	1	I wonder if that's the case...
evt/nq/msg_nq010104t.json
0	ZX1	You look like you're\nlooking for Url as well.
1	1	Do you have any leads?
2	ZX1	Nothing. And I've\ncombed this whole place.
3	ZX1	He's not here, I can tell you that.\nWho's to say he's not already\non the way back to Colony 9?
4	1	It's certainly possible...
5	ZX1	Url himself is the one who confessed\nhe couldn't send any more.
6	ZX1	I came here to stop Eilis seeing it...\nGreat how that worked out, huh.
evt/nq/msg_nq010105s.json
0	5	Where is this lad?! How can we not\nfind him with all these people?
1	1	He might be on the way back to\nColony 9 from Viliera Hill.
2	1	Maybe if we could find somewhere\nFourtune Clovers grow...
3	3	I've not seen any growing between\nAlfeto Valley and Colony 9.
4	XW1	Between valley and Kilmarris Highland!
5	1	OK, then let's see if we can find Url there.
evt/nq/msg_nq010106t.json
0	1	Find any Fourtune Clovers?
1	XX1	Ah!
2	1	Carrie and the others\nare worried about you.
3	XX1	...So I guess she\ntold you everything.
4	XX1	I can't go back to them.\nI'm worthless.
5		What will you say?
6		People need off-seers.
7		Why do you think that?
8	1	Colony 9 needs its off-seer.
9	XX1	Oh yeah? Well, nothing's\nstopping you from coming back.
10	1	Why do you think that?
11	XX1	Because I can't do it.\nI can't be an off-seer.
12	1	Look, Url-
13	XX1	Since I became the off-seer\nin your place...
14	XX1	I sent off friends who died in battle,\nwith all honor and respect. But...
15	XX1	Everyone who died after the\nFlame Clock was destroyed...\nWhat were those lives for?
16	XX1	I felt so much pity for them I couldn't\nstand it. All I could do was try not to\nthink of anything at all.
17	XX1	And when it got to that point,\nI couldn't raise the motes\nwhen I played the melody.
18	XX1	I can't... I can't send\nthem off properly.
19	XX1	I hid it from everyone in Colony 9,\nbut... The secret's out now. How can I\ngo back now?
20		How will you respond?
21		You should tap into a different emotion.
22		You want to go back to who you were?
23	1	You should find a different emotion\nto tap into, like gratitude.
24	XX1	A different emotion?\nI've never considered that.
25	1	Our role as off-seers is\nto communicate emotion.
26	1	The off-seeing isn't the most important\npart. It's managing to convey that emotion.
27	XX1	Noah...
28	1	Do you want to be the person\nyou were before?
29	XX1	Anything's better than being who\nI am now, someone incapable\nof making my friends happy.
30	1	You'd be going back to a role where\nyou see the dead off every day.
31	XX1	...I...
32	1	Your feelings aren't necessarily wrong.\nBut you've been delivered from the war.\nYou no longer need to kill others.
33	1	You have to find your own\nanswer, starting now.
34	1	But instead of suffering alone,\nwhy not talk to Colony 9\nabout your feelings?
35	XX1	...
36	I	There's no need for you to bear\nthe burden of this change alone.
37	XX1	Commander...
38	XX1	You're probably right, Noah.
39	XX1	But it'll take courage to confess\neverything to the whole of Colony 9...\nFirst I'll talk to Carrie.
40	1	That's a good idea.
evt/nq/msg_nq010107f.json
0	YX1	Url!
1	YX1	Where were you?!\nI was so worried!
2	YX1	If something had happened to you I don't\nknow how I could have lived with myself!
3	XX1	I'm sorry...
4	3	Don't just yell at him\nwithout hearing his side!
5	5	Yeah, come on, Url's been\nthinking about loads of stuff,\nlet him talk!
6	YX1	But-
7	XX1	Carrie.
8	XX1	I can't see people off any more,\nand I need to work through things a bit.
9	XX1	You saw what happened before,\nand I need to think about how\nthings got to that point.
10	XX1	And...I'm going to stop hiding\nmy failure from Colony 9.
11	YX1	What? But-
12	XX1	I talked to Noah and this is\nthe conclusion I came to.
13	XX1	I have to change the way I feel about\nsending, in these weird, unclear times.
14	YX1	Oh, Url...
15	3	Off-seers are just,\nso much. All the time.
16	5	I hear you.
17	5	Look, just look after\nhim a bit more, OK?
18	YX1	You don't need to tell me that.\nI'm his bodyguard, you know.
19	XX1	Thank you, Carrie.
20	8	Good job, team. Case closed!
evt/nq/msg_nq010108t.json
0	hX1	There's this place, Viliera Hill. An\nextensive battle took place there, before\nwe were freed from the Flame Clock.
1	hX1	I heard that Carrie goes\nthere with Url sometimes.
2	hX1	Apparently there are dead\nfrom that battle who still\nhaven't been seen off yet.
3	hX1	If you come across any of them,\nwould you do them that kindness?
evt/nq/msg_nq010200s.json
0	4	I heard that Colony 9 has been having\nsome major shortages.
1	I	That's nothing new.
2	I	But...
3	I	We didn't have so much of a problem\nwith food and resources till Colony 9's\nrank dropped.
4	I	So now frustrations are running high\nafter one too many shortages.
5	1	Is there anything we can do to help?
6	I	That would be great.
7	5	I guess there isn't anything we can do\nto fix it right this moment...
8	2	Resolving the food supply\nproblem is the highest\npriority, isn't it?
9	tV	Everyone sad when stomach\nempty! That just science.
10	6	But it'll take time for the\nfields to yield crops...
11	3	Hm, yeah.
12	3	If we could find something to tide\neveryone over until Zeon's field\nidea brings results...
13	1	...
14	XW1	Troublesome people as always...
15	5	Come on, Riku, if you've got any\nbright ideas we'd love to hear them.
16	XW1	Meh meh! Is easy plan!\nEven you can think of!
17	XW1	Is principle of finders keepers!
18	2	Meaning...?
19	XW1	Battlefield is full of usable\nitems with no owner.
20	3	...He's got a point.
21	3	When we couldn't go back to our colonies,\nwe survived with things we scrounged\noff various battlefields.
22	3	You gotta do what you\ngotta do to survive.
23	1	...I agree.
24	1	On an old battlefield we'll probably be\nable to find resources other than food,\nas well.
25	1	How about we search the battlefield\nat Everblight Plain near Colony 9?
26	4	There's one more place...
27	4	The place where we met Guernica\nis another promising candidate.
28	1	Right.
29	1	When we've found enough, we'll\ntake it to the Commissary.
30	1	Camilla will be able to\ndistribute it best.
31	5	OK! Then it's decided.
32	6	Hey, uh... I'll help too!
33	tV	Manana also lend a wing!
evt/nq/msg_nq010201f.json
0	1	Camilla?
1	gX1	Hi all. Is there anything you need?
2	gX1	...Though let me be clear that\nwe're pretty limited in what we've\ngot on hand right now.
3	I	We want to leave this\nwith you, if that's OK.
4	gX1	Whoa... It's all food and supplies.
5	gX1	How in the world did you...?
6	gX1	I'll make sure it gets to those\nwho need it in the Colony.
7	gX1	Thanks so much for this!
8	jn1	Hey!
9	1	Huh?
10	cX1	Where the spark did you get that?
11	3	Excuse you?
12	cX1	And don't feed me some crap\nabout finding it just lying around,\n'cause that won't fly with me.
13	cX1	So this is what I think happened.
14	cX1	You saw things couldn't last here and\nnicked it from someone else, didn't you?\nWhile we're forbidden from doing it.
15	I	No, we found it at Everblight Plain.
16	cX1	What?!
17	bX1	You're saying that we should\nloot and pilfer stuff to survive?
18	5	Well, what are your alternatives?
19	5	Survive by taking from\nthe living, even though you\ndon't need to fight any more?
20	cX1	...Ugh.
21	bX1	Don't touch any of this stuff, Camilla.
22	gX1	Look.
23	gX1	Now that the Colony's been freed,\nthings can't go back to the way\nthey were before.
24	gX1	I agree with them that this is the way\nto keep everyone in the Colony alive.
25	bX1	Camilla...
26	cX1	Zeon, if you're thinking of going\nalong with this, you can-
27	jn1	Meh-meh-meh! Camillaaa!
28	fX1	Camilla! Harala seen\nlist of arrive goods!
29	fX1	Harala wait for this day so long!\nCan now repair all Levnises, at long last!
30	gX1	OK, Harala, calm down.
31	cX1	Zeon, we aren't the only ones\nwho aren't happy with your\nway of doing things.
32	I	...
33	3	It's just till the shortages\nare sorted out.
34	3	Don't get so worked up about it.
35	I	I understand Kite's opinion, though.
36	1	We need those fields in working order,\nand then everything will work out.
evt/nq/msg_nq010202t.json
0	1	Seems usable. Let's take it.
1	5	Oho! This looks like\nit's got some use left in it.
2	3	This is practically brand new. Yoink!
3	2	Hm, this looks usable enough.
4	4	Its function appears unimpaired.
5	6	Yay! We can totally use this!
6	1	I'm sorry, I have to\ntake this for Colony 9.
7	5	I need this to help my friends.
8	3	...I'll just take this.
9	2	I need this to help the living.
10	4	This is vital for us. We'll make\nsure it's put to good use.
11	6	I'm so sorry. I have to take this.
12	1	Oh, rations. Should still be edible!
13	5	I'm sure these rations are still\ngood. Into the bag they go!
14	3	Ah!\nThere's some good eatin' here.
15	2	Packaging looks...fine?\nI'm sure it's still edible.
16	4	Doesn't seem to be damaged.\nI'll take it with me.
17	6	Oh! This looks like it's still edible!
18	1	That should be\nenough to go on.
19	5	This should be plenty.
20	3	This must be enough.
21	2	I think we've found enough now.
22	4	If we gather more than this we'll just be\ncausing logistical issues for ourselves.
23	6	We've found tons!
evt/nq/msg_nq010300s.json
0	1	People in Colony 9 really aren't happy\nwith the current food situation.
1	3	Even now they're released from the\nFlame Clock, this is all they whinge about.
2	2	And it'll take time for Zeon's\nfields to yield a harvest...
3	4	It probably isn't just Kite who's\nworried about the shortages.
4	4	If we let it go on as they are,\none day things will explode.
5	1	...
6	I	Actually...
7	I	I've caught wind of some nefarious\nscheming going on among the soldiers.
8	5	Whoa, really? What kind of stupid-?
9	I	Fox. Seems he's working on a plan to\nplunder the neighboring colonies.
10	1	This has probably occurred to\nyou all, but...
11	3	You mean the fact that Fox\nis plotting something idiotic?
12	1	Right.
13	1	I think...
14	1	I think he might be planning to raid\nsome of the neighboring colonies.
15	6	How could he...?
16	5	Sparks...\nI don't suppose a good punch in\nthe mouth would convince him?
17	2	I hope we're in time to stop him...
18	4	...Is Kite involved?
19	3	If he is, then this whole thing\ngets even bigger and messier.
20	3	He's always looking out for the rank\nand file, so they absolutely adore him.
21	4	I see.
22	I	...Then perhaps Kite might be able\nto persuade Fox not to go\nthrough with it?
23	5	Who knows? But we should be\nable to find them hanging around\nthe canteen.
24	1	Then let's go find them and\nhave a chat with them.
25	3	Maybe Camilla knows something.
26	3	She's the same term as Fox, and\nthey've been all buddy-buddy lately.
27	5	Do you think she's\nmixed up in this as well?
28	1	We'll never know without\nhearing what she has to say.
evt/nq/msg_nq010301f.json
0	5	Hey Kite. No Fox today?
1	cX1	What? We're not joined\nat the hip like you lot.
2	5	Oh yeah?
3	3	All right, pack it in. We\ndidn't come for a scrap.
4	dX1	(sigh) Queen's sake...
5	dX1	So? Have you got business with Fox?
6	1	We just heard something\na little troubling, that's all.
7	dX1	Hmm.
8	dX1	He went to gather a hunting party.
9	1	Hunting?
10	1	Do you know where he was going?
11	dX1	I don't know the details.
12	dX1	Oh, but he probably went to\ncheck the Melnath's Shoulder route.
13	2	Wait, but across Melnath's Shoulder\nfrom here, that's...!
14	4	This won't end well.
15	4	If we take his destination as the\ncolony nearest to Melnath's Shoulder...
16	4	Then he's almost certainly\nheading to Colony Gamma.
17	5	What?!
18	1	We have to go after him!
19	cX1	Wha?! What are you talking about?!
20	cX1	You're saying Fox is going\nto attack another colony?!
21	cX1	So that's what he needed the people for...\nBut he's not got nearly enough numbers...\nWhat was he thinking?!

23	cX1	We'll go with you and stop him. Get ready!

0	1	Fox!
1	bX1	It's you!
2		What will you say to Fox?
3		You can't attack other colonies.
4		What are you doing here?
5	1	You can't attack other colonies.
6	bX1	...So you heard, huh.
7	bX1	If you're going to try to get in my way,\nthen get ready for a real fight!
8	1	What are you doing here?
9	bX1	What do you think? Getting\nready for a hunting trip.
10	1	You came all the way out here to hunt?
11	bX1	Better quarry out here\nthan around Colony 9.
12		How will you respond?
13		Your quarry is Colony Gamma?
14		This is a dangerous place.
15	1	Your quarry is Colony Gamma?
16	bX1	Well, don't you just know everything.
17	bX1	If you're going to try to get in my way,\nthen get ready for a real fight!
18	1	Your quarry is Colony Gamma, isn't it?
19	2	If this is the size of your gang, they'll\nrun rings around you. Just give up and\ngo back to Colony 9.
20	bX1	Tch! They won't get the drop on me!
21	1	This is a dangerous place.\nColony Gamma's soldiers\nare active here.
22	bX1	What are you talking about?
23	1	Psst, just play along.
24	2	Gotcha.
25	2	There are strong monsters\naround the colony too.
26	2	We heard you'd come out hunting,\nso we came rushing here to tell you.\nThank goodness we made it in time!
27	bX1	And you had to come and tell me this\nface-to-face, because...?
28	4	Black fog came down\nand blocked our comms.
29	bX1	...
30	1	Kite and the others will be here soon.\nLet's wait for them and head back to\nthe colony together.
31	bX1	You talked to Kite?
32	bX1	Well, that's lit a fire under our bums.
33	I	I heard lately you've been spending\na lot of time at the Commissary.
34	I	Spending a lot of time with Camilla.
35	bX1	Hey, what's that supposed to mean?!
36	1	You've been spending a lot of time\nat the Commissary, haven't you?
37	bX1	What the spark has that\ngot to do with anything?!
38		Was Fox's true motive...
39		...to improve the colony's situation?
40		...to help Camilla out?
41	1	You were asking for advice on what would\nbe best for everyone, weren't you?
42	1	In which case, you should have\ncooperated with the colony and-
43	bX1	With the colony? Are you joking?
44	bX1	Whining brats, the lot of them.\nYou can't seriously believe I'd\ndo this for them?!
45	1	You wanted to help Camilla out, didn't you?
46	bX1	Tch!
47	1	Are you sure you can afford to keep up\nthis hunting trip and get home so late?
48	bX1	...Snuff it all.
evt/nq/msg_nq010303f.json
0	bX1	Ugh, how...?
1	1	Why were you going to\nattack another colony?
2	bX1	...
3	bX1	The shortages have been causing\ntrouble back at the colony, right?
4	bX1	And who was bearing\nthe brunt of that unrest?
5	bX1	The guys at the Commissary.
6	bX1	I understand being\nworried about the future.
7	bX1	But Camilla's lot shouldn't be the ones\nwho deal with all that crap.
8	1	So you were trying to protect her...
9	I	We've ways of dealing with this issue.
10	I	It'll be a while before we see\nthe results, but I promise you\nwe will break through this.
11	I	I'm really grateful for the effort you've\ngone to for your friends in Colony 9.
12	bX1	...I'll be waiting to see what happens.
13	I	I know.
14	1	We'll be working with you to\nimprove the situation too.
15	bX1	Talk is cheap.
16	bX1	But...
17	bX1	...I'll be waiting to see what happens.
18	5	Tch, what a faff.
19	cX1	There he is!
20	cX1	Hey, Fox!
21	3	Well, look who's\ncome to see you.

2	bX1	Sorry. Let's call it a day.
3	lZ1	OK.
4	5	Camilla hasn't seen you at all today.\nShe'll be missing you, you know.
5	bX1	Shut up! Keep your nose out!
6	bX1	...If you think you know what's going on,\nthen at least try to do something about it.
7	I	...Yes.
8	1	...All right.

1	gX1	I was just a little worried about\nFox. I haven't seen him today.
2	gX1	Actually, if you have time...
3	gX1	Could you find Fox at the canteen\nand tell him I want to see him?
4	gX1	Sorry to take up your time. Let me\nknow if there's anything you need.
5	gX1	For some reason I feel apprehensive...\nWas Fox at the canteen?
6	gX1	So Fox has gone off outside the colony...\nI hope he doesn't get himself in trouble.
7	gX1	Thanks a lot.
8	gX1	Come again!
evt/nq/msg_nq010400s.json
0	I	Kite left Colony 9 with\na few soldiers in tow.
1	3	Oh, what?\nWhat's that little div think he's doing?
2	1	Why would he-?
3	I	Agnus military activity was\nconfirmed near Millick Meadows.
4	I	Opinion was divided\nover how to deal with it.
5	5	You're saying he's headed there?
6	3	Surely even he doesn't think he can\nwreck a colony with so few people?
7	I	...
8	I	The Agnus colony is advanced, but\nthe scouts are reporting that they\nseem to be retreating from something.
9	I	That's what Kite and I judged\nto be the case, anyway.\nThat's why he... (sigh)
10	I	Now people are unsure on whether\nto ally ourselves with the colony that\nhas the Agnian army on the run.
11	1	...
12	I	I've told the scouts\nto look for Kite too.
13	I	Problem is, he seems to have gone to\nground somewhere. No one can find hide\nnor hair of him.
14	5	I don't know which colony this is,\nbut the only ones fighting the war now\nare ones allied with the Castle...
15	5	Meaning colonies run by Moebius.
16	1	What's your plan, Zeon?
17	I	I want to find Kite before\nhe puts himself in danger.
18	I	Will you help?
19	5	I suppose we've got to now.
20	3	I mean, yeah, but...
21	3	What are we meant to do\nif we don't know where he is?
22	1	Kite has plenty of friends among\nthe soldiers of Colony 9.
23	1	If we ask around, we might\nturn something up.
24	XW1	Speaking of, Fox still remain in colony.
25	5	What, he didn't go along with the others?
26	1	He might know where they went.
27	3	Good thinking!
28	5	I imagine we'll find him at the canteen.\nThey were always mooching around there.
29	1	Let's go and talk to him.
evt/nq/msg_nq010401t.json
0	bX1	You want to know where\nKite might be going?
1	bX1	There's a cave near the old\nFerronis Hulk at Millick Meadows.
2	bX1	We've stored supplies in there so it could\nbe used as a hideout in an emergency.
3	bX1	He could be in there. I'll send\nthe coordinates to your Iris.
4	1	Thanks. We'll see if he's there.
5	bX1	There was someone I didn't want\nto leave behind in Colony 9.\nThat's why I didn't go with him.
6	bX1	I couldn't stop him.\n...Please keep him safe.
evt/nq/msg_nq010402f.json
0	1	Is Kite here? We want to talk to him.
1	mZ1	Kite? Nope, not here.
2	1	...
3	mZ1	Sorry, but I can't say any\nmore to Colony 9 outsiders.
4	1	...Oh. Is that so?
5	mZ1	Commander?!
6	I	Is Kite in there? I need\nto speak with him.
7	nZ1	This way.
8	1	Kite.
9	cX1	Oh!
10	cX1	What are you doing here?
11	1	...Planning on paying any other\ncolonies a visit?
12	cX1	The friendly army is still fighting those\nAgnus guys. They need our help.
13	cX1	Colony 9'll be fine as\nlong as you're around.
14	5	So you're not going back?\nI thought you wanted to be\nthe big-shot commander?
15	cX1	We need results! We need to know that\nwe can survive using our own methods!
16	cX1	You guys are all about empty lip\nservice. It's rob or be robbed out here!
17	4	What do you change by repeating the\nsame thing over and over, switching\nbetween robber and robbed?
18	1	It doesn't make sense to aim just to\nsurvive this moment. That won't fix\nthe root of the problem.
19	cX1	But that's how we've always lived!
20	cX1	You don't understand us, Noah.\nYou really think your hollow gestures\nare going to fix Colony 9?
21	I	You're right.
22	I	Which is why you need\nto help us change things.
23	cX1	Wh-
24	I	I can't do this alone.\nI need you, Kite.
25	cX1	...That's not fair. It's not like you ever\nlisten to anything I say.
26	mZ1	Arghhh!
27	nZ1	Ahhh, help!
28	cX1	What's going on?!
29	pZ1	Kite, the Agnus army is here!\nThey're attacking!
30	cX1	Why now?! Sparks and ashes!
31	cX1	Engage the enemy!
32	cX1	You lot-!
33	1	We're from Colony 9 too.
34	3	Yeah, obviously we're going to pitch in?

4	5	Go on, get the snuff out of here!
5	eX1	If we don't kill them they're\nonly gonna come back here!
6	3	Then you'd best be someplace else, innit!
7	1	Ah!
8	1	Keves soldiers.
9	3	That sound... Was that...?
10	5	...
11	oZ1	Hey!
12	pZ1	Listen. We're from Colony 9-
13	kZ1	Why were these Agnians still standing?
14	pZ1	Huh?
15	cX1	Why-?!
16	kZ1	Colony 9? You're the ones that\nbetrayed the Castle.
17	3	I don't think I like these guys.
18	5	I guess we're doing this, then.
19	cX1	Hey...
20	cX1	They're from Keves... Can we really\nfight our own soldiers...?
21	1	...
evt/nq/msg_nq010404f.json
0	cX1	Now everyone's against\nus and it's all your fault!
1	cX1	How can we survive like this...?
2	I	And that's why we need\nyou so much, Kite.
3	cX1	What, otherwise our forces will take a hit?
4	dX1	Kite... You know I'll go\nanywhere with you.
5	dX1	So will you at least listen to what Zeon\nhas to say? You must be curious.
6	eX1	Agonizing over it all's a waste of\ntime. Just listen for five ticks and\nmake up your mind.
7	cX1	...
8	cX1	Whatever happened to those\nfailed fields of yours, anyway?
9	I	...The results aren't great. It takes time and\npatience to find crops suitable for the soil.
10	cX1	I thought today would be a failure too.\nChallenging the unknown isn't easy.
11	cX1	That's why I was so resistant.\nYou don't understand us.
12	I	But I understand you, Kite.
13	cX1	...What?
14	I	When things fall apart,\nI take full responsibility.
15	I	So there has to be someone to replace me\nas the person who supports everyone.
16	cX1	...And that's...me...?
17	I	Colony 9 must feel the same way.\nWill you help me support them, together?
18	I	You're the only person I can ask.
19	cX1	...
20	dX1	Kite.
21	eX1	...Five ticks are up.
22	cX1	I'll help you until we find a better\nalternative to your plan.
23	cX1	I bear responsibility too,\nas the future commander!
24	I	Very well. Thank you.
25	4	Then it's settled.
26	5	For now, at least.
27	1	...All right. Let's get back to Colony 9.
evt/nq/msg_nq010500s.json
0	3	Everyone's talking up\nthe Spongy Spuds!
1	5	They're mouthwatering even\nif you just steam them.
2	I	Heh. Didn't I say they were delicious?
3	5	You look well made up.
4	3	Not surprised. He got teary-eyed\njust from eating them raw.
5	I	Not just that!
6	I	We can reliably raise a sizeable yield\nwithout much difficulty. This has put a\nlot of minds at ease.
7	I	I think it's safe to say Spongy Spuds are\nthe key to Colony 9's survival.
8	2	The whole colony seems much\nbrighter now. Everybody's getting\na go of working in the fields.
9	4	When people are less anxious,\nthey're less prone to confrontation too.
10	4	I just wish we had a similar way to reduce\ninter-colony hostilities...
11	1	...
12	1	Don't we? Maybe we should give it a try.
13	6	Give what a try, exactly?
14	1	Let's try spreading Spongy\nSpuds to other colonies.
15	1	They'd solve food shortages,\nand maybe help a little with the\ntension and anxiety of the war.
16	4	Colony 9 certainly works as a successful\ntest model, but...are you sure this is\ngoing to work?
17	I	We'll do our best to make it work.
18	I	Hunger makes it hard to think\nrationally. It eats away at the heart.
19	I	We need to free people\nfrom that anguish.
20	3	Then let's get going?\nSpread the good news\nof the Spongy Spud!
21	I	We can't waste any time!\nI'll call some friends.
22	I	We'll continue this conversation in\nthe Colony 9 Commander's Office.
evt/nq/msg_nq010501f.json
0	I	So, as we discussed earlier...
1	I	We want to teach other colonies\nhow to grow Spongy Spuds.
2	hX1	Count me in.
3	hX1	Conflicts over food supply are tragic.\nIf there's anything we can do to help\nease them, we should.
4	cX1	I guess places with poor weather or\nbad crops would owe us a favor.
5	I	Looks like nobody objects.
6	cX1	I mean this is great and all,\nbut how are you going to do it?
7	cX1	You can't just hand over\na Spud and call it done.
8	I	You're right. We'll need people\nto be able to teach on-site.
9	I	I'd like Roald and Kite to take care of that.\nWork with the people in charge, listen to\nwhat they want.
10	hX1	Will do.
11	I	We'll need to suss out the best\ncolonies for cultivation, and\ndiscuss things with the leaders.
12	I	But the most important\nthing right now is the soil.
13	cX1	Ah, yeah, the soil needs\nEarthwormwood, right?
14	4	I've done some analysis on that front.
15	4	Colony 4 fulfills the geological criteria.
16	4	Colony 4 and Colony Mu\nfulfill the geological criteria.
17	hX1	Two locations. That'll be tricky\nfor the teachers to handle.
18	cX1	How about we narrow it down\nto one right now, as a test case?
19	cX1	Why don't you pick who\nwe'll approach first?
20	1	Let's see...
21		Which colony will you go to?
22		Colony 4
23		Colony Mu
24	cX1	Is that your final answer?
25		Do you want to reconsider?
26		Let me think...
27		Nope, I'm good.
28	1	OK, let's go and talk to the\nresource bods with Zeon.
29	hX1	Appreciated, mate.
30	cX1	I hope this works...
evt/nq/msg_nq010502t.json
0	1	Solon, can we talk to you?
1	@Z1	What's up?
2	@Z1	Er, I see. And you call them...\nSpongy Spuds?
3	@Z1	People can be a little wary about\nfood they're not familiar with.
4	1	You think it'll be hard to convince them?
5	@Z1	Hmm, no. Our colony is battling\nfood shortages right now.
6	@Z1	If this can take us a tiny bit closer\nto solving that, then I'd love you to\nteach us how to grow them.
7	@Z1	Could you give us some time\nto consider?
8	I	Yes! Thank you, yes!
9	1	Let's get back to Colony 9.
evt/nq/msg_nq010503t.json
0	5	Nico, you got a sec?
1	@f1	Oh, hi guys!\nWhat do you need?
2	@f1	Spongy Spuds, you say?\nAre they really all that?
3	I	They are, without a doubt, the greatest food\nknown to man or beast.
4	1	Wow, that's a confident assertion...!
5	5	Yeah, sorry, this guy's very into potatoes...
6	5	If you're worried about how to prepare\nthe fields, no need. Colony 9's willing\nto send experienced labor over.
7	5	So will you think about it?
8	@f1	Nico has to admit, Nico doesn't eat many\npotatoes... But Nico - and just to be clear,\nI'm Nico - is willing to entertain the notion!
9	@f1	I'll talk it over with the others. You don't\nmind if I don't have an answer right away,\ndo you?
10	I	Of course, take all the time you need.
11	I	We'll head back to Colony 9. Let\nus know if anything comes up.
12	@f1	Will do! And thanks!
evt/nq/msg_nq010504f.json
0	cX1	You came at just the right time.
1	cX1	We just got word that someone\nin Colony 4 wants to learn to\ngrow potatoes.
2	3	Ooh, that was quick!
3	hX1	I was actually about to assign\nsome teachers.
4	hX1	I was thinking of leaving this\none to Trish and Eastman.
5	cX1	Eastman works really hard at the fields,\nso I think he'd be a good shout.
6	cX1	He may be rubbish at expressing\nhimself, but as long as Trish is there,\nit should be fine.
7	I	Agreed, they're good choices.
8	I	So, sorry about the sudden\nrequest, but would you help?
9	dX1	Yep, leave it in our capable hands.
10	eX1	We'll get it done in two ticks.
11	dX1	What he means to say is that we'll work\nvery hard, so you don't have to worry.
12	I	OK, good to hear.
13	1	The other thing we have to take\ninto consideration is that it's a\nfood people aren't familiar with.
14	3	Bit of a roadblock if no one\nknows how to cook it, yeah?
15	2	We could share our favorite\nrecipes. What do you think?
16	9	That sound like forte of Manana!
17	9	Manana very well-equipped to share\ngoodness of Spongy Spuds with world!
18	5	I'm telling you, give 'em a quick\nsteam, job's a good'un.
19	9	If friends serious about Spongy Spuds,\nthen higher height of deliciousness can\nbe achieve!
20	9	Cooking intuition of Manana say so!
21	I	OK, then how about this?
22	I	We could try to find an original\nrecipe suited to that colony.
23	I	We can find out about the colony's\nparticular tastes, what they're looking for.\nI think we'll get people on board that way.
24	9	Yes, that good plan! Manana all for it!
25	cX1	It's weird for you to think about\nhow on board people are with a plan...
26	hX1	It just means people can change,\nno matter how many terms they've\ngot under their belt.
27	I	OK, OK, that's enough.
28	3	So Manana's taking care of the recipes.
29	5	We can do the asking around then.
30	2	Good. Then let's start\ngathering data from Colony 4.

5	cX1	We've heard it's full of young people\nso we picked a pair they can feel a bit\nmore at ease with.
6	cX1	And Url's got a bit of a green thumb.
7	I	Right, he was a big help with the fertilizer.
8	I	So, sorry about the sudden\nrequest, but would you help?
9	YX1	If Url's in, I'm in.
10	XX1	I don't think I'll be much use\nto be perfectly honest, but...
11	XX1	I'm not going to turn my nose\nup at an opportunity like this.
12	XX1	And it'll be interesting to get\na look at an Agnian colony.
13	I	OK, good to hear.

31	2	Good. Then let's start\ngathering data from Colony Mu.
evt/nq/msg_nq010506s.json
0	1	So about that recipe you've\ncome up with for Colony 4...
1	tV	Market research was very superb!
2	tV	People of Colony 4 want\nto gorge until tum-tum is full!
3	3	They'll have a hard time of getting\na high enough yield with the soil\nthey've got.
4	5	The recipe's going to have to take\nthat into account then, if people\nare going to have enough to eat.
5	tV	That true!
6	tV	Spongy Spud can be grow in\nhundred and thousand now.
7	tV	So cuisine need to keep flavor fresh\nand not let people get tiresome of it.
8	I	That makes sense.\nWhat an ingenious take.
9	I	So how do we put that into\npractice? I'll do whatever I-
10	tV	From you? Nothing.
11	I	...Oh.
12	5	Hey, it's not the end of the world.
13	tV	Image of recipe is like\ncrystal in Manana's mind.
14	tV	Soon is ready for present to Colony 4!\nManana have complete faith in abilities!
15	I	That's great news!
16	3	Let's get cracking then!
17	2	Manana, is there anything you\nneed besides the Spongy Spuds?
18	tV	Manana need six Spongy Spuds,\ntwo portions of Cured Armu Sirloin,\ntwo sprigs of Deodorugula...
19	tV	Oh, and also three Drumstick Leeks!
20	I	We can arrange some of that for you.
21	5	Wow, you are really buzzing\nabout this, aren't you?
22	I	...Quiet, Lanz.
23	1	Once the ingredients are ready, we can\nunveil Manana's creation to Colony 4.
24	1	Let's have a look at the fields and then\nwe can talk to Solon about cooking.
evt/nq/msg_nq010507f.json
0	6	Oh wow, it's really coming along, huh!
1	dX1	We've managed to get all the\nseed potatoes in the ground.
2	dX1	It went pretty quick with\nsome helping hands!
3	@Z1	People were eager to help when they\nfound out it was about maintaining\na self-sufficient food supply.
4	3	Now all you need is to turn them\ninto potatoes.
5	@Z1	...Yeah.
6	@Z1	...
7	I	Is there something on your mind?
8	@Z1	Of course most of our soldiers\nhope the fields will yield crops too.
9	@Z1	But we've had other potatoes in rations\nbefore, and they...weren't good. So some\nsoldiers aren't in favor of this experiment.
10	@Z1	I know this is a lot to ask of you...
11	I	So we have some naysayers?
12	I	Well, we actually have a proposal!
13	9	Time for Manana to shine!
14	1	Manana's actually put together\na bespoke recipe for you.
15	@Z1	Oh! How marvelous.
16	9	Manana please to show.
17	9	Everyone, wash human paws\nand get ready for cook!
evt/nq/msg_nq010508f.json
0	9	Let cooking begin!
1	9	And Ta-da-to Surprise is finish!
2	9	Pon appétit!
3	eX1	...
4	eX1	It's good.
5	ea1	Whoa, this is amazing! I never knew you\ncould make potatoes taste this way!
6	fa1	I could eat this every day\nfor the rest of my life!
7	ga1	And there's so much! I think this is\nthe first time I've ever truly been full!
8	@Z1	With Colony 9's help, we've taken a big\nstep in resolving our food supply issues.
9	@Z1	We're indebted to you.
10	I	I'm glad we could be of service.
11	eX1	I'm going to get back to the fields.
12	@Z1	First I think I'll try some\nSpecial Spongy Ta-da-to Surprise...
13	eX1	You've got two ticks, and that's it.
14	@Z1	Oof, what a slave driver...
15	9	Now is exciting to wait for day\nof harvest of Spongy Spuds!
16	1	That's for sure.
17	3	Everyone's a wannabe potato\nfarmer here. They're going to\nhave bigger fields than Colony 9.
18	I	No competition here.
19	I	The more potatoes we have,\nthe more peace we'll have.
20	I	...At least, that's what I believe.
21	2	You've made a first step today, Zeon.
22	2	One more step toward your ideal.
23	I	I've never really thought of it as an ideal.
24	I	I suppose it is. And maybe\nit's just a small step in the\ngrand scheme of things.
25	I	But for me...it's a pretty big one.
evt/nq/msg_nq010509s.json
0	1	So about that recipe you've\ncome up with for Colony Mu...
1	tV	Market research was very superb!
2	tV	People of Colony Mu want to feast eyes on\ncuteness of food before tums on tastiness!
3	4	I find their preoccupation with the\n"cuteness" of their food somewhat\nirrational, but to each their own...
4	tV	It not irrational! Presentation very\nimportant element of cooking!
5	tV	Heart of people is very\nsensitive to appearance.
6	I	That makes sense.\nWhat an ingenious take.
7	2	We talked about texture with them too,\nand a good crispiness polled high.
8	4	So they want a potato that's cute,\nbut also has a nice mouthfeel...?
9	5	I can't even imagine what that would be.
10	tV	Don't worry pretty heads, and\nleave everything to Manana!
11	tV	Manana make cute tasty food\nthat will never go out of style!
12	I	So how do we put that into\npractice? I'll do whatever I-
13	tV	From you? Nothing.
14	I	...Oh.
15	5	Hey, it's not the end of the world.
16	tV	Image of recipe is like\ncrystal in Manana's mind.
17	tV	Soon is ready for present to Colony Mu!\nManana have complete faith in abilities!
18	I	That's great news!
19	3	Let's get cracking then!
20	2	Manana, is there anything you\nneed besides the Spongy Spuds?
21	tV	Manana need six Spongy Spuds,\nthree portions of Full-Bodied Ardun Meat,\ntwo whole heads of Empress Lettuce...
22	tV	Oh, and one big Juicy Broccoli\nand two Thousand Carrots!\nNot "2,000 carrots", that entirely too many.
23	I	We can arrange some of that for you.
24	5	Wow, you are really buzzing\nabout this, aren't you?
25	I	...Quiet, Lanz.
26	1	Once the ingredients are ready, we can\nunveil Manana's creation to Colony Mu.
27	1	Let's have a look at the fields and then\nwe can talk to Nico about cooking.
evt/nq/msg_nq010510f.json
0	2	Everything seems to be going well here.
1	XX1	We just got all the seed potatoes planted.
2	@f1	Url has a very kind and gentle\nway of planting!
3	@f1	Nico feels sure that kind of planting\nwill lead to extremely tasty taters.\nAnd I'm her, so I'd know!
4	XX1	Actually, that's just how you plant things...
5	XX1	I was just trying to let the seeds know\nhow hard they have to work to grow.
6	@f1	Url, you're just too much!
7	XX1	Haha, I'm really not...
8	5	They're getting on well...
9	I	Yep.
10	9	Time for eating!
11	9	Everyone, wash human paws\nand get ready for cook!
12	@f1	Ooh, dinner?
13	I	We know it's hard to incorporate an\nunfamiliar ingredient into a menu.
14	2	So Manana's put together\na special recipe for you.
15	@f1	Whaaat?! That's so cool!\nWhere is it? Can Nico eat it now?!
16	9	Teehee!
17	5	Time to break from work.\nTo the mess hall!
evt/nq/msg_nq010511f.json
0	9	Let cooking begin!
1	9	Spongy Pon-Fried Croquettes is finish!
2	9	Pon appétit!
3	@f1	It's almost too adorable to eat!
4	xf1	...You should eat it though, it's great!
5	ag1	Oh-ho-ho-ho!!!
6	ag1	It so crisp and fluffy!\nAltogether yummy!
7	@f1	Thanks so much for telling\nus about Spongy Spuds!
8	@f1	Nico - that's me, natch - thinks these are\ngoing to be a big hit with the whole colony!
9	I	I'm glad to hear that!
10	YX1	It's still a long way to harvest, though.\nYou have to tend those fields every day.
11	@f1	Don't worry, Urly will keep us right!
12	mi1	Yeah!
13	9	Now is exciting to wait for day\nof harvest of Spongy Spuds!
14	1	That's for sure.
15	5	Aw man, they're going to\noutclass Colony 9's spuds!
16	I	I very much doubt that!\nBut it'll be a friendly contest.
17	I	The harder we all work at this,\nthe richer our day-to-day lives will be.
18	I	...At least, that's what I believe.
19	2	You've made a first step today, Zeon.
20	2	One more step toward your ideal.
21	I	I've never really thought of it as an ideal.
22	I	I suppose it is. And maybe\nit's just a small step in the\ngrand scheme of things.
23	I	But for me...it's a pretty big one.
evt/nq/msg_nq010600t.json
0	1	Lenny, are you...alone here?
1	1	You look a bit peaky, Lenny. You OK?
2	ZX1	Noah...
3	ZX1	I let down Jango and the others...
4	1	Tell me what happened.
5	ZX1	...My team was wiped out.
6	ZX1	We ran into rampaging monsters\nat Sonata Saddleback.
7	5	That's Grave Bunnit country.
8	3	And they attack in swarms...
9	ZX1	Yeah... There were so many\nthat we were just overwhelmed...
10	ZX1	My power frame was broken\nand the others defended me...\nWe were so close to the colony...
11	1	...I'm sorry.
12	ZX1	Noah, I want to ask you\nto do something for me,\nas an off-seer.
13	ZX1	Play for my friends.
14	ZX1	Please send them on.\nJango, and Olivia-Anne, and Marlon...
15	ZX1	Before monsters get to them.
16	1	Of course. Can you give us the coordinates?
17	ZX1	I'll send the info to your Iris.
18	ZX1	Thank you for doing this.
evt/nq/msg_nq010601f.json
0	1	...Over there!
1	5	What are they doing with\nJango and the others...?!
2	1	Let's stop them!
3	5	Yeah!
evt/nq/msg_nq010602t.json
0	1	We sent off your friends.
1	ZX1	Thank you...
2	1	...Are you OK?
3	ZX1	This isn't the first time I've lost friends.\nI don't know why I can't get used to\nthe feeling...
4	1	You don't have to get used to it.
5	ZX1	Is that what you think, as an off-seer?
6	ZX1	...Anyway, you've eased my heart a little.
7	ZX1	Thank you so much.
evt/nq/msg_nq010700s.json
0	1	Colony 9's been struggling ever since we\ncut them off from the others...
1	5	No helping that, though.
2	1	Still, it'd be nice if we could\ndo something to help.
3	1	What do you think is the most pressing\nshortage in Colony 9 right now?
4	3	Huh, I wonder...
5	5	If you're asking what they need\nthe most, then food, I guess?
6	3	But that's only really the very top of\na very large pile of needs, seriously...
7	3	They would've been used to getting some\nof their stuff directly from the Castle.
8	3	I reckon a bunch of people are\nfeeling uneasy right now, left\nwithout any support.
9	1	Mm...
10	3	They did get something\na short while ago, right?
11	3	The war with Agnus is dragging on\nlonger than anyone thought it would.
12	3	And shortages are bad for\nthe war business, so they'd get\ncontainers of supplies dropped.
13	5	Oh, that's right.
14	1	...
15	1	...Do you think there are\nany still lying around?
16	3	You mean from back then?
17	1	I remember one that was blown away\nby the wind. We couldn't recover it.
18	5	Really?
19	1	I must still have the logs from back then...
20	1	Got it! It's up the waterfall\nat Murmur Rise.
21	5	Then let's take a gander\nand see if it's still there.
evt/nq/msg_nq010701f.json
0	3	Can't believe we've actually found it...
1	5	Looks like monster territory, but it should\nbe fine if this is all we're contending with.
2	1	Then let's get to it!
evt/nq/msg_nq010702f.json
0	jn1	Stop right there.
1	1	Ah!
2	dX1	Wait, Noah?
3	1	Trish?
4	dX1	I guess we've both had the same idea.
5	3	You're after it too?
6	dX1	On Kite's orders.
7	dX1	We were going through old logs and came\nacross a container that was never found.
8	1	What a coincidence.
9	eX1	We'll be taking back\nwhat you found.
10	eX1	So hand it over nicely.\nYou have two ticks.
11		What will you do?
12		Discuss the matter.
13		Hand it over.
14	1	What should we do?
15	2	That's a good question.
16	eX1	Time's up.
17	3	Hey, hey!
18	1	OK.
19	1	We planned to take it to\nColony 9 from the start.
20	1	But if you were looking for it too,\nthen it's better if you take it back.
21	dX1	We will.
22	dX1	But you can't go empty-handed.\nYou deserve something for getting\nthe monsters out of the way.
23	5	How kind of you.
24	dX1	Anyway, we have other places\nleft to investigate, so we'll head off.
25	1	See you.
26	1	So...
27	3	It's not much, but do\nwe take this to Camilla?
28	1	Right.
evt/nq/msg_nq010703f.json
0	dX1	All right, enough!
1	dX1	Ugh...
2	dX1	You were going to take this back to\nColony 9 anyway, right?
3	dX1	We'll let you take care of that, then.\nSay hi to Camilla for me.
4	dX1	OK, we have other places to check out.\nLet's find the next one sharpish.
5	eX1	Hmph.
6	3	Ugh, that Eastman bloke...!
7	1	Let's see what's in this container, then.
evt/nq/msg_nq010704t.json
0	1	Hey, Camilla, we have supplies\nthat Colony 9 can use.
1	gX1	Wow, there's so much!\nThank you!
2	hX1	Did you find this? This is great.
3	gX1	Must have been hard to get hold of.
4	1	We had a little disagreement\nwith Eastman over it.
5	gX1	Oh, him. He's not a bad guy, you know.
6	gX1	Anyway, thanks again!
evt/nq/msg_nq010705f.json
0	1	Camilla, it's not much, but...
1	gX1	Whaaat?! Thank you so much!
2	gX1	Actually, Eastman came in earlier\nwith some supplies in tow.
3	gX1	Look at this.
4	hX1	When Kite says he's going to\ndo something, he really does it.
5	hX1	No wonder Zeon values him so highly.
6	3	I'm sure there were\nmore supplies than that.
7	5	They didn't pocket some for themselves...?
8	1	...
evt/nq/msg_nq010800s.json
0	3	D'you hear the goss?\nEastman and Lenny\nhave been butting heads.
1	1	That's an unusual match.
2	3	Eastman lashed out for some\nidiot reason. Didn't like Lenny\nkeeping secrets or something.
3	5	Not one for patience, is he?
4	1	...
5	1	What sort of secrets was Lenny keeping?
6	3	I don't know if he'd talk to us,\nbut it can't hurt to try, if you're worried.
7	1	Right.
evt/nq/msg_nq010801t.json
0	1	So, we heard you had\na run-in with Eastman.
1	ZX1	That news reached even you lot, did it?
2	ZX1	So you've come to visit me because\nyou're worried? Well, no need.\nIt wasn't anything big.
3	ZX1	I was asking Eilis a favor.
4	ZX1	Eastman happened to show up looking\nfor me, and when I snubbed him, he got\na bit...ticked off, so to speak.
5	1	Asking Eilis a favor, huh?
6	ZX1	Oh, just something to do\nwith Colony 9's future...
7	1	Can we ask what it is?
8	ZX1	Yeah, I can definitely share it with you.
9	ZX1	I was thinking about\nmy dead team, and...
10	ZX1	I remembered that Marlon had said\nsomething about finding some gear\nthat didn't come from Agnus or Keves.
11	ZX1	We might be able to use it for Colony 9,\nright? Unknown military equipment might\nhold useful secrets.
12	ZX1	I thought Eilis would be able to go\nlooking for it in a Levnis, so I asked.
13	1	Sounds mysterious.
14	ZX1	Interest piqued? Not piqued?
15	1	Piqued.
16	2	I wonder...
17	1	Yeah, it's probably from the Lost\nNumbers. We should check it out.
18	ZX1	If that's the case,\nyou can meet up with Eilis.
19	ZX1	Let me send the coordinates\nto your Iris.
20	1	Appreciate it.
21	ZX1	Who in the world could this third\nmilitary power be?
22	ZX1	Be nice if we could find some information\nthat would give hope to our future...
evt/nq/msg_nq010802f.json
0	1	Eilis!
1	aX1	Noah? Don't surprise me like that.
2	aX1	Have you been talking to Lenny?
3	3	Got it in one.
4	3	So, this is the thing?
5	aX1	Yep.
6	aX1	You can tell it's different from\nAgnus's gear, right? And it's not\nKevesi either...
7	1	Interesting.
8	2	This equipment...
9	4	It looks like Guernica's.\nSo I guess...
10	1	Definitely Lost Numbers gear.
11	aX1	Something tells me you\nknow something about it.
12	aX1	I was looking into it before you came.
13	aX1	There's nothing usable in it, nor are\nthere any clues as to who it belongs to.
14	1	...I see.
15	aX1	At any rate, it's so mysterious\nI don't want to let it go, so I'm\ngoing to report it to Roald.
16	1	Good plan.
17	3	We can't just leave this stuff either...\nShould we bury it again?
18	1	Hm? Wait, isn't this...?
19	1	We should report this to Lenny.
evt/nq/msg_nq010803t.json
0	ZX1	So, how did it go?
1	1	We verified that it was definitely\nnot from either Agnus or Keves.
2	ZX1	I knew it!
3	1	But that's about as far as we got.\nAll we found was this card.
4	ZX1	Huh...
5	ZX1	I was hoping we could learn something\nthat would improve Colony 9... Oh well.
6	ZX1	As for the card, you found it,\nso you can keep it.
7	1	We managed to confirm that it's from the\nCity. It belonged to the Lost Numbers.
8	1	I don't think it's really\nwhat you were hoping for.
9	ZX1	I see... Oh well.
10	1	We brought back what\nwas left there, just in case.
11	ZX1	I don't really know how to use it...but\nmaybe I could find out if I went to where\nthe soldier who had it came from?
12	ZX1	Here, you should take this.
13	1	You're sure about this?
14	ZX1	Yeah.
15	ZX1	Thanks for the help. I appreciate it.
16	ZX1	I guess I should go and straighten\nthings out with Eastman.
17	1	Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
evt/nq/msg_nq010900s.json
0	3	So, about Eilis.
1	3	Seems like she hasn't come back\nto Colony 9 in forever.
2	I	First I've heard of it. What else has\nbeen going on while I've been away...?
3	1	That's worrying. No one has any idea?
4	3	Not in the slightest.
5	3	Looks like she upped and left in a Levnis\nso that narrows it down. I think she's\nprobably OK, but...
6	4	If she's taken a Levnis out,\nthen she might mean to\nbring back something big.
7	4	Maybe she needs to\ntravel a great distance.
8	5	What business would she\nhave outside Colony 9?
9	6	Either way, we're gonna\ngo find her, right?
10	6	What if she's in trouble?\nCome on, hup hup, let's go!
11	3	Yeah.
12	3	Ah!
13	3	That's right, she said something about\nthe soil on Hope's Rest...
14	1	Hope's Rest?
15	2	There's nothing there any more...
16	4	Should we check around the prison?
17	1	Let's see if we can find her.
evt/nq/msg_nq010901f.json
0	3	Eilis!
1	aX1	Huh? What are you doing here?
2	1	We heard that you've been away\nfrom the colony for a while\nso we came to look for you.
3	3	What did you come all the\nway out here alone for?
4	aX1	A Nopon Caravan told me that there's\na good place to grow plants around here.
5	aX1	I thought I could take a load of\nthe soil and bring it back to\nfertilize the fields in Colony 9.
6	aX1	But now I'm finally here,\nready to bring back the soil...
7	aX1	I was tired from the long\njourney, and I made a\nmistake with the controls...
8	5	Yeah, looks that way.
9	5	Riku, you're up.
10	8	As if Riku have choice.
11	2	Oh!
12	2	Someone's there.\nI can hear footsteps.
13	jn1	The voices came from this way.
14	T	Oh, it's you.
15	5	Just give us a heart\nattack, why don't you!
16	aX1	Wait.
17	aX1	Mwamba? It can't be you...
18	aX1	You're alive?
19	1	Eilis, the thing is...
20	aX1	I can't believe something\nlike that could happen.
21	aX1	It's weird to think that the Mwamba\nstanding here isn't the Mwamba I knew.
22	aX1	But I'm glad I got\nto meet him again.
23	5	Eilis! Our resident furball says we need to\nswap out some parts, but it should be fine!
24	bk1	The Levnis we came in is nearby.
25	bk1	We should have spare parts to give you.
26	aX1	Thank you.
27	4	So why did you come here?
28	bk1	Hope's Rest is rich in resources\nso we came looking to see\nwhat we could find.
29	bk1	The City's full of people who\ngot out of prison, like me.
30	bk1	And that big a surge in\npopulation isn't easy to cope with.
31	aX1	Then let me help you out\nin return for fixing this up.
32	1	We're game too.
33	bk1	That would be great!
34	bk1	OK, so what we need from you is\nStavepetals, Titanic Bee Hives\nand Sodie Stones.
35	bk1	If you could get ten each of those,\nwe'd be set. Think you can manage that?
36	6	We sure can!
evt/nq/msg_nq010902f.json
0	T	Hey.
1	3	Mwamba! What's up?
2	T	Riggie said I should\nhelp you guys out.
3	T	So here's what we've found so far.
4	5	So you've decided to transfer to\nour salvage corps? Wonderful!
5	T	Huh?
6	8	We be sure to work you hard.
7	5	Too right.
8	T	Come on lads, give me a break.
9	1	Are you used to living in the City yet?
10	T	I'm getting there.
11	T	Monica and the others\nhave done a lot for us.\nMe and Hackt, you know.
12	1	That's good.
13	6	I wonder why his memories\nhaven't come back, like Miyabi's.
14	4	Yeah, well, when you think of how\nthey died that's probably for the best.
15	2	I think so too.
evt/nq/msg_nq010903f.json
0	aX1	OK, here's what I've managed to find.
1	3	One more push and\nthat should be it.
2	aX1	Whoa, we've picked up loads!
3	3	Mwamba lent us a hand.
4	aX1	Haha, he's a born salvager.
5	aX1	He's still Mwamba, memories or not.
6	3	Mwamba would have done\na way better job though.
7	aX1	Hahaha, probably!
8	aX1	I found the place where he was\nkilled. Just by total chance.
9	aX1	There was equipment left behind,\nscattered all over the place.\nIt's still...hard to remember.
10	aX1	The truth is, when I crashed\nthe Levnis I was distracted.\nThinking about him.
11	aX1	...So I was really surprised to see him!
12	3	Oh, Eilis...
13	aX1	He's doing OK, right?
14	1	That's what he said.
15	aX1	Then that's good. I'm glad.

2	lW1	Sure.
3	9	So much already found!\nHackt genius searcher!
4	lW1	Mwamba's the genius.\nHe told me all the tricks.
5	lW1	Can I ask you to take\nthe stuff I can't carry?
6	9	It pleasure of us to help!
7	6	Are you friends with Mwamba?
8	lW1	Yeah. We've been through a lot together.\nHe's one of those guys who takes\npeople under his wing, you know?
9	5	Huh.

11	4	It seems so.
12	2	It's always stayed with me, how\nwe couldn't save him from D...

1	aX1	Yep! Thank you so\nmuch, I owe you one.
2	aX1	Everyone's probably out of their\nminds with worry, so I'd better get\nback to Colony 9 straight away.
3	3	Not going to chat with Mwamba?
4	aX1	It's fine, he doesn't\nknow me anyway.
5	aX1	And it would just...make me sad.
6	aX1	I got to see him smile one\nmore time. That's enough.
7	aX1	I mean, think about it! If it was\nthe Mwamba I knew, he'd have\nhit his time long ago.
8	5	Right.
9	aX1	I'm just glad that this time I get\nto say goodbye properly.
10	T	Hey, you going already?
11	aX1	Yep! I've got my own stuff I need\nto be getting back home.
12	T	Ah, shame.
13	T	You're from the same colony\nas Noah and the others, right?
14	aX1	Right.
15	T	I guess I'll see you next time, then.
16	aX1	You...will?
17	T	Yeah, me and Hackt have been talking\nabout taking a trip when things have\ncalmed down. Seeing the world.
18	T	And we decided our starting\npoint would be Colony 9.
19	aX1	You did?
20	aX1	Then I'll be waiting to say\nhi when you come!
21	T	Good!

0	bk1	When I was at the prison camp, I used to\npick up Stavepetals from round the water.
1	bk1	I saw Titanic Bee Hives around tree roots\nall the time, and Watchtower No. 1 was\nalways surrounded by Sodie Stones.

1	lW1	I think you'll find them if you\ngo looking over there.

2	zX1	But whaddya know, suddenly the wind's\npicked up, and the drop's been blown\nWAY off course...
3	1	Oh, is that why you were looking out\ntowards Skyview Falls?

12	zX1	Yeah, well... I put in to request a supply drop\njust earlier.

14	1	Oh, is that why you were looking out\ntowards Skyview Falls?
15	5	Nothing for it, I guess.\nWhy don't we go pick it up?
16	zX1	Seriously? Wow, it's my lucky day!\nYou Special Forces folks really are the best!
17	3	You know we're not Special Forces\nany more, don't you...?
18	zX1	Anyway, if you do manage to collect it,\nfeel free to hold onto it. It was all stuff meant\nfor the front lines, anyhow.

5	@X1	...Oh! Maybe!
6	1	When did you last hear from them?
7	@X1	Hmm... They reported their arrival at\nShark's Jaws Cape, and since then,\nnot a peep...
8	1	Shark's Jaws Cape, right?\nWe can go check it out. You guys\ncan go on ahead with your assignment.

evt/nq/msg_nq020100s.json
0	2	So, Teach, what's this favor\nyou wanted to ask?
1	J	OK, I'm just going to come out and say it.
2	J	I want to know if you'd consider teaching\nthe newbies in Colony Gamma.
3	4	In an instructional capacity...?
4	J	Colony Gamma's Flame Clock was\nbroken by your hand, Ouroboros.
5	J	But the conflict between\nKeves and Agnus continues.
6	J	If things get more violent, then my newbies\nare going to need to be proficient in battle\nif they're going to survive.
7	3	And you want us Kevesi crew to teach\nthem what we know?
8	J	Yes! That's why I asked you. The training\nwill be all the more meaningful, coming\nfrom you.
9	2	So...there's an extra dimension to this?
10	J	Yes. If you teach them, you'll become\nthe model for them to emulate.
11	1	You want them to...emulate us?
12	J	Keves is supposed to be our implacable\nenemy, living only to bring Agnus down.
13	J	But you overturned those biases, and came\nto an understanding among yourselves.
14	J	So I want them to take you as their role\nmodels and shake up their ideas.
15	4	You want them to relax their aggression\nand wariness towards Keves?
16	J	...Having such strong feelings with nowhere\nto vent them is going to eventually drive\npeople to fight over nothing.
17	J	I think it's vital to teach them this, to keep\nthem away from war.
18	1	...I understand. Well, in that case, we'll\nbe only too happy to help out.
19	3	I've gotta say, this is my first ever\nteaching job. Where should we start?
20	6	Yeahhh...
21	J	Don't worry about that. I'll support\nyou through the beginner program.
22	J	First, I'll post the news that you've been\nmade teachers, along with your personal\nhistories on the colony bulletin board.
23	J	Based on the bulletin board posting, the\nsoldiers will decide who they want to\nlearn from.
24	4	An unusual method. Letting the\nstudents choose the teacher?
25	J	Right. This method emphasizes\ntheir independence.
26	5	But if you do it this way, surely\neveryone will just choose Mio.
27	J	Not at all. The new recruits are\ngenuinely curious about all of you.
28	3	Guess we'll find out. Let's give it a go.
29	2	I've never taught either, but I'll\ndo my best not to let you down.
30	J	You know, I believe it, coming from you.\nThank you so much for helping me out\nwith this.
31	J	Now go out there and lead those\nnewbies into a new future.
evt/nq/msg_nq020101f.json
0	J	So, properly speaking...
1	J	This is the part where I'm supposed\nto praise the newbies' efforts and\nbring the exercise to a close.
2	J	But it looks like...they're of\nthe same opinion as me.
3	J	Mio.
4	J	Sena.
5	J	Taion.
6	J	And our dear Kevesi allies.
7	J	Your teaching has made them\nfull-fledged soldiers and\nunparalleled people.
8	J	Overcoming the spent antagonism\ntoward former enemies...
9	J	you sincerely faced each other,\nfrom the same place.
10	J	And made the right\npath plain to them...
11	J	You've burdened yourselves with the\nconcerns of Colony Gamma, namely,\nthe cultivation of the next generation.
12	J	All of us wish to thank you from the\nbottom of our hearts.
13	J	The effect you've had on Gamma will\nprobably spread to other colonies too.
14	J	The effect may be a drop in the ocean,\nin this world of raging and ceaseless war...
15	J	but, we can all be proud of the ripples that\nthis tiny, yet significant step will send out.
16	J	We hold you in the highest esteem,\nOuroboros!

0	6	Eunie, a teaching assignment's\ncome in for us!
1	3	Yeah, looks like it.\nAlthough I'm shocked\nthey even wanted *me*.
2	1	You're a lot easier to approach\nthan me or Lanz.
3	5	Even in Colony 9 all the young'uns\nloved you. Hate to say it, but you're\njust a surprisingly caring person.
4	3	To ashes with your "surprisingly"!
5	3	So what idiots have asked for us?
6	6	Yeah, um... About that...
7	4	You were asked for by Foots's squad.
8	4	They're a strong team, skilled in battle.\nMainly Attackers and Defenders.
9	4	They enjoy fighting a bit too much, but\nthey're pretty exceptional soldiers.\nTheir captain, Foots, in particular.
10	3	Ooh, that don't sound too bad,\na bunch of hot-blooded newbies!
11	6	Don't take them lightly, Eunie!\nEspecially Foots! He's super rude.
12	6	Especially to me! I have no idea why!
13	5	Oops, sounds like they don't\ntake you seriously.
14	3	Sounds to me like we've got\nourselves a prime opportunity!
15	3	We can knock this attitude out of their\nheads while we whip 'em into shape!
16	6	I don't think whipping is called for...
17	3	We just need to show them we're on a\ntotally different level to them. That'll keep\nthem from mouthing off, yeah?
18	6	Oh!
19	6	Yeah, that makes sense!\nThen let's whip 'em good!
20	3	Then it's settled. Looks like we got\nsome rookies to teach!
21	6	Oh yeah! We gotta do what we gotta do!
22	2	Um, you know these are just\nnew recruits you're talking about,\nright? Don't break them.

1	YY1	Looks that way!
2	ZY1	Can you both just not?
3	ZY1	Sorry, Sena. These guys\nwere raised by Ferises.
4	6	Oh, um, no need to apologize, Ysorra-
5	XY1	Right. Sena's the one who\nmade us wait, after all.
6	YY1	That she did!
7	6	OK, th-that's enough!
8	3	Looks like someone's in need of a little\ndiscipline! Right, Sena?
9	6	...Right, yes, exactly!
10	3	And no time like the present, eh, loves?\nMock battle time!
11	6	Time for some hard weightlifting!
12	3	...What?
13	6	Uh...?
14	3	Hey, what happened to\nwhipping 'em good? Mock battle's\nthe best whip there is.
15	6	Is it, though? This is totally\nweightlifting's time to shine!
16	3	You wanna pump iron.\nSo what, we just sit this one out?
17	6	We can all do it with them!\nRight? We gotta show them\nwe're on a different level!
18	3	That ain't what I had in mind!
19	ZY1	Guys, don't fight...
20	6	You all want to do some strength training,\nright? Everyone wants to get strong!
21	3	Yeahhh, no, mock battle it is.\nI'm gonna teach you runts to fight.
22	XY1	...
23	XY1	Pshh.
24	XY1	Mock battle sounds fine.
25	6	Wait just a second!\nDid you just "pshh" at me?!
26	XY1	You must have imagined it.
27	YY1	All in your head!
28	XY1	See, I strength train every day. Honestly,\nI wanted to prove myself against you.\nTake on a real live Kevesi soldier.
29	YY1	What he said!
30	ZY1	I...wouldn't put it like that, but\nI think it'd be a good experience...
31	6	Aw man, you too, Ysorra?
32	3	The majority has spoken!
33	3	These little scamps are all full of\nbeans, so a good mock battle's\nperfect to wear them out.
34	XY1	Wow, looks like the Kevesi\nunderstands us better than\neven the illustrious Sena does.
35	YY1	So let's show her how tough we are!
36	XY1	We'll be waiting for you in the training\nground. Don't run away in terror, yeah?

4	XY1	...Yeah we do.
5	XY1	But I can't stand it. You still look so fresh!

10	XY1	Sound good to you...Miss Eunie?
11	6	...Ah!
12	6	MISS Eunie?!
13	XY1	Oh, and Sena, you better be ready too.
14	YY1	Yeah, be prepared, Sena!
15	6	Why don't I get a nice title?!
16	XY1	But I'll let it slide for today.\nI'm knackered.
17	6	...
18	6	N-no, you don't get to decide\nwhen the lesson's over!\nThis is where it really begins!
19	XY1	...Er, what?
20	6	You've shown you want to get\nstronger, so let's have a little\nstrength training competition!
21	ZY1	...Strength training?
22	XY1	You know, actually I'm done for-
23	6	You want to beat us, don't you?\nThen strength training is the only way!
24	6	Now you're all done warming up,\nyou should be in tip-top condition!
25	6	It has to be now!
26	6	You have to train!
27	6	It's the only way!

3	6	What?! B-but why...?
4	XY1	We're doing you a kindness here. If we\nhadn't picked you, no one would have.
5	6	H-how rude! That's not true at all!
6	XY1	Well, truth is, I was thinking you've got\nsome real grit. You could put up a real\nchallenge.
7	XY1	You're the strongest out of everyone, you\nsee. Giving you a good beating will\nactually count for something, won't it?

4	4	Noah, a word?

19	5	Out of the pure goodness of my\nheart, I'll let him have this one.\nKnock 'em dead, Noah.
20	1	Ha, yeah, OK...
21	4	Get yourself ready, and then I'll see\nyou in the colony square, if that's OK.
22	1	Yeah, sounds good.\nSee you there, Taion.
evt/nq/msg_nq020301f.json
0	4	I did think you'd be the ones who\nasked for me as a teacher.
1	cY1	What gave us away?
2	4	You've always been so enthusiastic\nabout asking me things.
3	cY1	Well, yeah, I respect you\npretty highly as a strategist.
4	cY1	I thought you'd have some good lessons\nto teach. So maybe it was presumptuous\nof me, but yes, I put you forward for it.
5	cY1	I'm just a little puzzled...
6	cY1	I don't remember asking\nfor this Kevesi.
7	1	Oh, I, er...
8	4	I'm the one who asked him.\nHe's going to assist me in teaching.
9	4	So, today's lesson will consist of several\nproblems you'll be expected to solve.
10	4	I want to gauge your understanding\nof basic tactics and situational\nawareness.
11	cY1	No objections to your plan here.
12	cY1	But I do have a problem with that\nguy being involved in the teaching.
13	4	I see.
14	4	And what do you two think?
15	dY1	As a member of Captain Zakir's\nteam, I'll abide by his decision.
16	eY1	I... I, well...
17	eY1	I agree with, erm, Mina...
18	cY1	I'm not going to go against\nCommander Teach on this.
19	cY1	I just don't think I have enough\ninformation to judge whether Keves\nis trustworthy. That's the truth.
20	cY1	As someone who intends to be the\nnext commander, it's kind of my\njob to look into these things.
21	4	That would be a big job.\nSo, what's to be done now?
22	1	Look.
23	1	How about if I answer Taion's\nquestions as well, then?
24	cY1	Buh?
25	4	Wait. Why, though?
26	1	Well, you know...
27	1	It's always easier to solve something like\nthis with a straightforward contest, right?
28	4	That...makes no sense at all.
29	cY1	It doesn't make a difference to me, Taion.
30	4	...So you're OK with this?
31	cY1	It's at least a better way to end it than\neach prodding at the other to test their\nnerve, wasting time.
32	cY1	Better to have a contest with\na clear winner and loser.
33	1	Very confident of you.\nIt suits me just fine!
34	4	...Whatever, then, but just don't forget\nthat we're all here to learn, OK?
35	cY1	Let me get permission to\nuse the war council area.
36	4	That would be appreciated.\nWe'll meet later, then.
37	cY1	Agreed. Later.
38	eY1	...

0	4	Let's see how you both measure up.
1	4	Unfortunately, Team Zakir falls\njust short of a perfect score.
2	cY1	Oh, what? Snuff this!
3	4	Noah, I have no comments. Full marks.
4	cY1	...What?!
5	1	Get in!
6	cY1	...Looks like I'm going to have to\nreconsider my opinion of you.
7	4	Let's see how you both measure up.
8	4	Team Zakir has a good\ngrasp of the subject.
9	cY1	You like to give us some pretty\nfiendish questions, Taion.
10	cY1	So I did my research.
11	4	And as for Noah...
12	4	Good effort, but you were just a whisker\naway from Team Zakir's score.
13	1	Oh...

0	cY1	I absolutely want you to\nteach this stuff to them.
1	4	To whom?
2	cY1	Kyrie and Foots.
3	cY1	They're not good at sitting quietly.
4	cY1	They need to learn more about combat\nsituations that they can't just brute force\ntheir way out of, or leave to chance.
5	cY1	Their carelessness will tarnish\nCommander Teach's good name.
6	cY1	When it comes to Foots, since\npeacetime he hasn't had any respect\nfor Commander Teach.
7	cY1	Which is why he'll\nnever be platoon leader-
8	dY1	Zakir, isn't there something you\nshould be saying before all this?
9	cY1	...Right. Yeah. Sorry.\nYou're right, Mina.
10	cY1	Noah, isn't it?
11	1	Yeah...
12	cY1	I lost this one. And I accept\nyour victory gracefully.
13	cY1	...But, if I can be frank, I can't just\nimmediately start trusting you.
14	eY1	Captain Zakir...
15	cY1	If I was going to lie about that,\nI would never have accepted\nthis challenge in the first place.
16	cY1	You may feel I'm not holding up\nmy part of the bargain, but this is just\nhow I feel. I won't apologize for it.
17	1	You know, though, I'm actually glad\nyou came straight out and said it.
18	cY1	...You're optimistic, aren't you?
19	1	I think what we need is to\ncompromise, bit by bit.
20	1	Whatever form that takes, whether it's\nplaying games like this or being honest\nabout our feelings or whatever.
21	1	The important thing is that we come to\nknow each other. Do you get my drift?
22	eY1	Hmm, getting to know each other...
23	1	We don't mean you any harm.\nWe just want to help.
24	1	That's the truth. I just want you to know.
25	dY1	...
26	cY1	...You know that whatever you say,\nit's not going to make me any more\nable to trust you.
27	cY1	But I do understand.
28	cY1	This is what Commander Teach\nis hoping for too, isn't it?
29	1	Well...
30	cY1	Anyway, if you want to teach here,\nthen I want you to face the students\nwith the appropriate sense of responsibility.
31	cY1	So keep that in mind and you\nmight earn my respect too.
32	1	I will. Thank you, Zakir.
33	cY1	...As long as you understand.

11	cY1	Let's not beat around the bush.\nWhat do you have to say for yourself?
12	1	Nothing. I lost, and I accept that.\nI have no right to-
13	4	Zakir, even if Noah had\nwon the competition...
14	4	It wouldn't have made you\ntrust the Kevesi any more.\nAm I right?
15	cY1	...Absolutely right. No result\ncan change the way I feel.
16	cY1	Honestly, this whole little competition\nthing meant nothing to me from the start.

0	1	...Hey, Lanz, listen to this.\nI've been asked to teach as well.
1	5	What?! No snuffin' way!
2	4	The request came from Schoon,\nfrom Zakir's team.
3	1	She's one of the new recruits\nthat Taion taught the other day.
4	5	I see... So that's how it is, huh?\nDid she take a shinin' to you then?
5	1	Maybe? I don't know... I don't\nreally recall talking to her much.
6	2	She's an off-seer like us, so\nmaybe that's why she's curious\nabout meeting a Kevesi one.
7	1	Ah, that makes sense. But in that case,\nI wonder what I should teach her...
8	5	Man... I wish I could've been one\nof Taion's teaching assistants, too...
9	3	Oh that's riiiiiight, you're now the\nonly one of us Kevesi who hasn't\nbeen requested by anyone, Lanz!
10	5	Ouch...!
11	5	H-hey, Noah, old buddy, old pal?\nHow about I help you out this time?
12	4	Good grief...
13	2	You don't need to rush. I'm sure\nsomeone will ask for you eventually.
14	5	Thanks, Mio... (sniff)
15	6	Don't lose hope, Lanz!
16	5	(sigh) Well, if you need my help, Noah,\nI'll be around. Just, loafing about. Like\na tool. So, uh, yeah. Just let me know.
17	1	Sure, I'll do that.
18	1	I suppose I should find Schoon now...
evt/nq/msg_nq020401f.json

2	eY1	No... It's no bother...

5	bY1	I have no business with you, but there's\nnothing wrong with me being here, right?
6	bY1	I won't get in your way.
7	1	A-all right, then...\nI suppose I don't mind...
8	eY1	I-I'm also OK with it...if you\nreally want to, Zuno...
9	bY1	...
10	1	O...K...? Guess he doesn't quite trust me yet...
11	1	He doesn't seem like someone\nSchoon would be partners with,\nbut...not my business, probably.
12	1	Let's jump right into it, then-
13	eY1	U-um, wait...!
14	1	Oh, uh...yes?
15	eY1	S-sorry for interrupting...!
16	1	No, it's OK. What were you going to say?
17	eY1	It's just...um... You're a Kevesi\noff-seer...aren't you?
18	1	That's right. And you're an\noff-seer too, or so I've heard...
19	eY1	Yes...but I, uh... I don't really know\nhow to send someone off properly...
20	eY1	I play my flute, but...I get the feeling\nthat's not all I should be doing, so...
21	1	Hm...
22	eY1	I-I'm sorry...! Oh, what am I on about...?
23	1	...No, I wasn't judging you. I can\nkind of understand how you feel.
24	eY1	Oh...! Really...? B-but...
25	1	Ah, I know. Why don't we step outside\nthe colony for a little while?
26	eY1	Outside...?
27	1	I'm sure I saw a body of water in\nthe mountains not too far from here.
28	eY1	...You mean Coolley Pool?
29	eY1	Ummm... Could you wait a bit? I need\nto ask permission to leave the colony...
30	1	Do you want to come too, uh...\nSorry, I've forgotten your name...?
31	bY1	Zuno. Sure, I'll come, but please just\npretend like I'm not even there.

2	eY1	I wonder... What were these people thinking,\nwhen they realized they were dying?
3	eY1	I wonder if they wanted to\ncarry on living...
4	eY1	...or if they were relieved that it meant\nthey didn't have to fight any more...
5	1	...It might be neither of those things.\nCould be something completely different.
6	eY1	I feel like...I have no idea what to do...
7	eY1	I want to empathize with them, but it feels\nlike my melody just rings hollow...
8	eY1	The more people I send off...\nthe emptier I feel inside...
9	1	...If it's how you feel,\nthen it's how you feel.\nNo one can argue with that.
10	eY1	I'm so sorry... I feel like I barely\nunderstand anything at all...
11	bY1	Schoon...
12	1	It's all right. We'll take it slow.\nIf you feel anything else, at any\npoint, just let me know, OK?
13	eY1	...OK.
14	eY1	...It always used to feel like\na proper send off before.
15	eY1	I never had doubts like this\nwhen Miclan was still around...
16	1	...Ah, right. Agnian off-seers\nplay in pairs, don't they?
17	eY1	Yes... Miclan was my partner.
18	eY1	He went to fight in Alfeto Valley,\nthough, and since then, he...
19	1	...Ah, I see.
20	eY1	...So I guess I'll have to be an\noff-seer on my own from now on.
21	eY1	But just the thought of that makes my\nmind go blank... Like I don't get what\nthe point is, of any of it...
22	eY1	I never gave off-seeing a proper\nthought to begin with...
23	eY1	I just left it all to Miclan to take care of...
24	1	I don't know if this will alleviate\nyour worries or not, but...
25	1	How about rather than thinking about how\nyou *should* send them off, you try\nthinking about how you *want* to do it?
26	eY1	"How I want to do it"...?
27	bY1	...That's a big frown.
28	eY1	Huh...?
29	bY1	You're thinking too hard.
30	eY1	Oh... Am I?
31	1	Don't panic, we're in no hurry.\nJust do whatever you think is right.
32	eY1	The lights float away...
33	eY1	They overflow from the body, like they've\nbeen set free, from everything...
34	eY1	It looks so...beautiful.
35	eY1	I want to help these beautiful lights...
36	eY1	I want to lead their dance into\nthe sky, sparkling way up high.

1	5	What kind of person is he, would you say?
2	6	Huh...? Why are you asking me about\nhim all of a sudden...?
3	5	Well you see... Heh heh heh...\nYou really wanna know...?
4	3	Stop acting so cocky and answer\nthe sparking question!
5	5	Now, now, hold your Ponios!\nTruth is...the little chap asked\n*me* to teach him!
6	1	Finally! Good for you, Lanz!
7	5	Yeah! It's time for me to step up to\nthe plate and do my thing, at last!
8	3	Wow. He must have a few screws loose\nif he asked a big weirdo like you for help.
9	5	Heh... I'm in a good mood today,\nso I'll forget you just said that.
10	6	Anyway, you asked about Namuki...\nHow can I describe him...?
11	2	He always has excellent grades, and he\nnever makes a mistake, whether in the\nclassroom *or* on the battlefield.
12	4	Mm. You won't find him rushing headlong\ninto battle like Foots or Nagumo.
13	4	Why a boy like Namuki would want\ntutoring from a brute like Lanz is\nsomewhat of an enigma to me...
14	2	Yeah, it is hard to tell what he's thinking\nsometimes. An inscrutable sort...
15	6	Right? I have a little trouble with him, too...
16	5	...Come on, you lot. You call\nyourselves mentors? Shame on you!
17	3	There's nothing more annoying than the\nsound of Lanz getting carried away...
18	5	Well, it doesn't matter what he's like.
19	5	What really matters is that I\nmake sure he knows I'm a great\nrole model that he can depend on!

27	5	Hey, wait a sec! It's not nice\nto judge people so quick, Sena.
28	5	Maybe we're not quite on the same\nwavelength, but at least he asked *me*\nfor help. That much I understand!
29	5	I have to meet his expectations,\nas his mentor! Right?!
30	1	Yeah... I guess so.\nYou can handle it, Lanz.
evt/nq/msg_nq020502f.json
0	5	Eh? What are these guys doing here...?
1	aY1	I gathered Kyrie and company\nto help out with my test.
2	WY1	Pleasure to meet you, sir!\nThough I have no clue why we're here!
3	bY1	...I've got a rough idea.
4	aY1	All right... If you're all prepared, I will\nask you all now to conduct the battle.
5	aY1	The rules will be those of a mock battle.\nPlease keep fighting until I say "stop".
6	aY1	Team Kyrie. Please fight to the best\nof your ability in order to test our\nsenior colleagues' true strength.
7	WY1	C-copy that!
8	aY1	Of course, that means the opposing\nteam should fight with equal fervor.
9	5	Uh...? OK...?
10	aY1	Are there any questions? I don't think so.
11	aY1	Now, please take your positions!
12	aY1	Are both sides prepared?\nIn that case, let the battle commen-
13	5	Hold on, you! Aren't you joining in?!
14	aY1	Of course not. I need to observe\nand take notes.
15	5	But this is supposed to be *your* training-
16	WY1	Don't worry, sir! Namuki is super smart!\nHe's the prized advisor of my team!
17	WY1	Don't worry! Just trust what he says!
18	aY1	Ah, Kyrie, you can always be relied upon\nfor sound judgments. That's a leaderly\nquality!
19	5	I-I see... So that's how it is, eh...?
20	5	Bah, might as well do this anyway.\nGet ready, you lot! You're going down!
evt/nq/msg_nq020503t.json
0	aY1	Please do the best you can. I'll be taking\nnotes up until the very last second.
evt/nq/msg_nq020504f.json
0	aY1	...All right, stop.\nPlease sheathe your Blades.
1	WY1	Phew, it's finally over...!
2	bY1	(pant pant)...\nYou satisfied now, Namuki?
3	aY1	To be honest, I would have preferred\nlonger, but I got the minimum data needed.
4	aY1	I'll share my battle report later. I hope you\nwill find it useful for improving your skills!
5	WY1	Thanks, Namuki! You're the best!
6	aY1	Now, I would like to have a word in\nprivate with our seniors here, so please\ndisband in a calm and orderly fashion.
7	WY1	Nice work today, everyone!
8	bY1	...Yeah. See ya.
9	aY1	Thank you for waiting, everyone.
10	aY1	For you three Kevesi, allow me to give a\nbrief review of your battle performance.
11	3	Yikes, here we go...
12	aY1	You have a good balance of skills and are\nhighly adaptable to emergent situations.
13	aY1	Though I did not see any prominent\nabilities, your strength lies in having\nno major flaws.
14	1	D-do you really think so? I'm not\na great judge of such things...
15	aY1	You're excellent at utilizing ether-
16	aY1	...No, rather, your body has\na remarkably high affinity for ether.
17	aY1	It's highly efficient at converting the ether\nflowing through it into your abilities, just\nlike a high-performing circuit...
18	3	Oh, huh...?
19	aY1	I also have the sense that those\nwings on your head hold some\nkind of secret that ties to this.
20	aY1	If you could just give me one\neensy feather-
21	3	Nope.
22	aY1	OK, then. I'll find out eventually, though.
23	aY1	Mister Lanz!!!
24	5	Y-yeah?!
25	aY1	Personally, I thought you were\nthe most interesting of all.
26	aY1	Just as your appearance suggests, you\nare by far the sturdiest of the group.
27	5	Heh. Well, that's obvious.\nI like to push myself in my training.
28	aY1	No, I mean even regardless of training,\nI think your body was made to be\nstrong and sturdy from the beginning.
29	aY1	It's as if...you were somehow built\nto be as solid as possible?
30	aY1	Looking closely, your body tissue seems\nto be of quite a different sort to Noah's\nor Eunie's...
31	aY1	Anyway, the three of you all have some\nclear differentiating features.
32	5	...So what exactly is he trying to say?
33	3	How would I know? I s'pose\nneither of you have wings, like me.
34	1	I never really paid much attention to that...
35	aY1	Yeah, exactly!
36	aY1	We're all similar and different at the\nsame time. But nobody really troubles\nthemselves with that fact.
37	aY1	Ignoring for the moment the question of\nthis inconsistency, I still require samples\nto prove these differences conclusively.
38	aY1	And so, to begin...
39	aY1	Mister Lanz, I will now conduct a\nfull body inspection. Please strip.
40	5	You can't just spring that on me!
41	5	I don't mind, though. I'll just go ahead-
42	5	OWWW?!
43	5	That snuffing hurt! What was that for?!
44	3	I should be asking you that! Why would\nyou just strip right here in the open?!
45	6	E-exactly! Don't scare us like that!
46	5	...What? It's just taking off clothes.\nNothing wrong with that.
47	3	Of course it's wrong!
48	3	...Wait... Is it?
49	6	Ummm... I can't think of a reason...?
50	5	Why did you sock me one, then?!
51	3	I dunno... Reflex, I guess?
52	6	Y-yeah! You just look like you need\na good smack sometimes!
53	5	What the snuff is with you two...?!
54	aY1	Hm. Interesting. Very interesting...
55	aY1	What kind of response is that, exactly?\nIs it limited only to Mister Lanz, or...?
56	aY1	Oh, I can't just stand here idling!\nI need to research for my next test!
57	5	What?! Hold on... Oi, come back!
58	aY1	Oh... My apologies, my eagerness\ntook ahold of me once again...
59	aY1	I hope you will cooperate with\nme again soon, Mister Lanz.
60	aY1	I expect...great things from you.
61	5	Ooh...!
62	aY1	Mostly of an ecological nature.
63	5	O-OK, sure! You can count on me!\nJust let me know whenever you need me!
64	aY1	Indeed. I'd predicted...I mean hoped...\nyou might say that.
65	aY1	Well then, that's all from me.
66	5	You hear that, Noah? He expects\n"great things" from me!
67	1	Y-yeah, I heard...
68	5	...Man. It's great, being a mentor.
evt/nq/msg_nq020599f.json
0	aY1	...Can we please talk later? I'm right in\nthe middle of getting my research\ndocuments in order.
1	5	Oh, my bad. Didn't mean to bother\nyou when you're so busy.
2	aY1	Oh...! Wait a moment.\nYou are Mister Lanz, correct?
3	5	"Mister" Lanz? My name's Lanz,\ndon't know if I need the "Mister"...
4	aY1	I never would have imagined you\nwould come to seek *me* out!
5	aY1	Oh, my name is Namuki, by the way.
6	aY1	I was actually thinking of requesting\nyou for some mentoring.
7	5	There's a guy called You? Good for him-
8	5	Wait!!!
9	5	You mean me?! You wanted *me*?!
10	aY1	Yes. I'd do anything for your help.
11	5	Y-yeah, sure! I'll deal with it! I'm just\nso glad you chose *me*-
12	aY1	I'll get back to my documents now.\nI'll see you at training.
13	5	O-OK... See ya later, then!
evt/nq/msg_nq020600s.json
0	6	I was confused as to why Mimi\nhasn't had any teaching requests so far...
1	6	But it turns out they're all pulling names\nout of a sparkin' hat to decide who gets to!
2	2	Why would they do that...?
3	4	Well, it's not surprising. They all\nidolize you especially, Mio.
4	2	Really? I'm not sure that's true-
5	6	Yes it is, Mimi!
6	4	Zakir probably turned it into a lottery to\nmake sure things didn't get out of hand.
7	4	It'd be no laughing matter if a brawl broke\nout over who gets to be taught by you.
8	2	You're exaggerating there, Taion.
9	5	It looks like the lucky winner of your\nmagnificent teachings was that chick Kyrie.
10	2	Apparently so. I wonder what\nI should teach her, though...
11	3	How about...how to read maps?\nShe's useless with directions.
12	4	She already did the training for it\ndozens of times...
13	3	...Wow, she's more geographically\nchallenged than I thought...
14	2	Uh, well... First I'll just ask her what\nshe wants to do. Then I'll decide.
evt/nq/msg_nq020601f.json
0	2	Where is Kyrie, anyway...?
1	5	Wait... There's no way she managed\nto get lost *inside* her own colony,\nright...?
2	2	I can't deny the possibility...
3	WY1	Miooo! Come on, over here!
4	WY1	Nyeheheh! I've got you all to myself now!
5	WY1	Nyeeheehee... Ohohoho...
6	2	...Uh, Kyrie...?
7	WY1	...Oops! Get a hold of yourself, Kyrie...
8	WY1	So, um, Mio... You'll hear out my request\ntoday, no matter what it is, right?
9	WY1	I wanna go somewhere with you and\nask you lots of different questions,\nand then, oh, and then-
10	2	Just relax a little bit, OK...?
11	WY1	Yes! I'm sorry! I'm just so happy...
12	WY1	Well then, let's, uh, let's go, right away!\nFollow me!
13	3	It's like she doesn't know the\nmeaning of the word "relax"...
14	1	I wonder where she plans on taking you?
15	2	I'll let her lead the way. It's important\nto respect your juniors' autonomy.
evt/nq/msg_nq020602f.json
0	WY1	Oh! Mio, look at this!
1	WY1	There's something on the ground over\nthere! Shall we go take a little looksie?
2		What will you do?
3		Hesitate to go that way.
4	2	Didn't you have somewhere else in\nmind that you wanted to show me?
5	WY1	...Ah! Yeah, you're right! I almost forgot...
6	2	This is probably how she ends\nup getting lost all the time...
7	2	Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
8	WY1	Got it! I'll pare it down from now on!
9		Go and take a look.
10	2	This is probably how she ends\nup getting lost all the time...
11	2	But it's probably fine just this once,\nsince she has us to watch over her.
12	2	All right, then. Let's take a look.
13	WY1	OK!
evt/nq/msg_nq020603f.json
0	WY1	Wh-what's this...?!
1	2	A dead Volff...? Who would\nhave done this...?
2	WY1	M-Mio...!
3	2	Kyrie, have your Blade at the ready, and\ndon't even think about leaving our side.
4	WY1	U-understood!
evt/nq/msg_nq020604f.json
0	2	Phew... Looks like we lost them.
1	WY1	Y-you're amazing as ever, Mio!\nThat was so flickering cool!
2	WY1	You're strong, beautiful, *and* kind...!\nI respect the flame out of you!
3	2	No need to flatter me, Kyrie...
4	WY1	I'm not trying to flatter you!\nI'm telling the absolute truth!
5	WY1	I think everyone feels the same way.\nThey all wish they could go on\nadventures with you...
6	WY1	That's why I want to be just like you...
7	2	...Kyrie?
8	WY1	Um... Mio, if I may ask... Do you\nreally think I'm suited to being a\nleader?
9	2	Hm...? Why are you asking me\nall of a sudden?
10	WY1	It's just... You probably\ndon't know this, but...
11	WY1	Namuki was actually supposed to\nbecome the leader of my team.
12	WY1	He turned down the role, though.\nHe figured I'd be better suited to it\nand nominated me instead...
13	WY1	I always wanted to be a team leader,\nso I was over the moon about it, but...
14	2	You've had enough of it now...?
15	WY1	O-of course I'm still happy about it.\nIt's just...
16	WY1	Sometimes I wonder if I was\nthe right choice for the job...
17	2	Oh, Kyrie...
18	jn1	Ayyy! Come at me!!!
19	2	I know that voice...!
20	WY1	Wait, is that...?!
21	WY1	Foots!
22	2	We have to help him...!
23	2	Can you still fight?
24	WY1	Y-yeah! Of course!
25	2	First, we have to get out of here.\nNo complaints, I assume?
26	WY1	N-nope...!
evt/nq/msg_nq020605f.json
0	WY1	...Are you OK, Foots?
1	XY1	"OK", my arse. Why won't you\njust stay outta my way?
2	WY1	Wha...?! How was I "in your way"?
3	WY1	I don't care how strong you are, those\nVolffs would've eaten you alive!
4	XY1	As if I would ever screw up that badly.\nUnlike you, Kyrie.
5	WY1	You always overestimate your abilities.\nYou can't keep doing that. That's what-
6	XY1	Yeah, yeah, I get it. "That's what\nCommander Teach says." I'm so\nbored of hearing that all the time.
7	XY1	You can't do anything if you're weak.\nAll you can do is trust in your abilities.
8	WY1	That's not what I meant...!
9	XY1	Who cares what Commander Teach says?\nI can think for myself too, y'know.
10	XY1	Unlike you, going along with whatever\nyou're told. What kind of leader are you?
11	WY1	Ngh...!
12	XY1	It's all about survival of the fittest.\nEven Commander Teach knew that.
13	XY1	That's why I have to keep getting stronger,\nno matter what it takes.
14	XY1	...Got it?
15	XY1	Not that I care what you think.
16	WY1	Gh...
17	XY1	See ya.
18	2	Good grief... He's as rude as ever.
19	WY1	Mio...
20	2	Mm-hmm?
21	WY1	In your opinion, how do you think\na team leader should be?
22	WY1	Maybe I should be more like Foots after\nall? Someone stronger, someone who\nwalks to the beat of their own drum...?
23	2	...Maybe so. Someone who oversees\nothers might need to be a bit like that.
24	2	But that's not all you have to be.
25	2	Everyone has different ideas of what\na good leader is. Plus, there are many\ndifferent ways of putting the work in.
26	2	...Just like Foots has his own way.
27	WY1	Mio...
28	2	...Kyrie, how far is our destination?
29	WY1	Oh... Right! It's not that far! This way.
evt/nq/msg_nq020606f.json
0		You acquired a Sack of Dark Grapes.
1	WY1	Look, Mio! There's a ton of\nDark Grapes in this sack!
2	2	Someone clearly must have dropped it.\nIt has the Colony Gamma insignia on it.
3	WY1	That sounded like a monster...!
4	2	It came from up ahead. They\nmight be attacking somebody...
5	WY1	Th-that sounds bad! Let's hurry\nand give them a hand!
evt/nq/msg_nq020607f.json
0	WY1	Zakir! Mina!
1	2	Let's back them up, Kyrie!
2	WY1	R-roger that!

0	cY1	...I never thought the day would come\nthat *you* would be saving *us*.
1	WY1	I'm just glad you two are safe...
2	dY1	Oh, did you pick those up for us?
3	WY1	Huh? Oh, you mean all these\nDark Grapes? These are yours?
4	dY1	Yeah. Zakir and I were out\nforaging for ingredients.
5	dY1	But unluckily for us, we bumped into some\nmonsters and dropped them as we ran.
6	WY1	So that's what happened...
7	WY1	...But wait... Why were you\nforaging for food?
8	WY1	Isn't that what the culinary team is for-?
9	cY1	...You're always off in your own world.
10	WY1	Huh...?
11	dY1	...
12	cY1	Don't you understand the state\nour colony is in right now?
13	cY1	We can't expect any supplies from the\nCastle now, and our stores are depleting.
14	WY1	R-really...?
15	cY1	When the going gets this tough, we can't\nafford to keep to our separate duties.
16	cY1	Everyone has to take some initiative...\nDo their part to make things better again.
17	WY1	Ah...
18	cY1	Aren't you supposed to be a team leader?\nWhy not try and use your brain for once?
19	cY1	Try thinking about what you and your\nteam can do for Colony Gamma.
20	WY1	Gh...!
21	cY1	Anyway, that's enough yapping for now.\nMina and I should get back to the colony.
22	cY1	...Well then, see you later.
23	2	Kyrie...
24	WY1	Mio...
25	2	Mm-hmm?
26	WY1	In your opinion, how do you think\na team leader should be?
27	WY1	Maybe I should be more like Zakir? He's\nsmart, and considers lots of different things\nat once...
28	2	...Maybe so. Someone who oversees\nothers might need to be a bit like that.
29	2	But that's not all you have to be.
30	2	Everyone has different ideas of what\na good leader is. Plus, there are many\ndifferent ways of putting the work in.
31	2	...Just like Zakir has his own way.
32	WY1	Mio...
33	2	...Kyrie, how far is our destination?
34	WY1	Oh, uh... Just a bit further down that way...
35	2	I see. Mind leading me the\nrest of the way, then?
36	WY1	Y-yes! Of course!
evt/nq/msg_nq020609f.json
0	WY1	Here we are, Mio!
1	2	Wait, this is...
2	WY1	After you, Sena and Taion disappeared,\nI came here time after time to look for you.
3	WY1	Even after everyone else had given up...
4	WY1	Or rather, they probably were just starting\nto move on and look to the future...
5	WY1	But I was sure... I knew in my heart that\nyou were still alive out there somewhere...
6	2	Kyrie...
7	WY1	But...I can't keep falling back\non you for help all the time.
8	WY1	I'm supposed to be a leader...
9	2	Going back to our earlier conversation...\nwhy did you want to become a leader?
10	WY1	Because...!
11	WY1	Because...it's cool...!
12	2	Cool...?
13	WY1	I can't explain it very well, but...
14	WY1	Well... I've always looked up to leaders...\nI just wanted to be like them...
15	2	I see...
16	2	Do you think depending on others\nisn't "leader-like", or something?
17	WY1	...Huh?
18	2	Being able to lean on others and accept\nhelp is easier said than done.
19	2	That's because, in a way, it lets others see\nwhere you're weak, or lacking...
20	WY1	Mm...
21	2	But you're not afraid to ask your\nteam for help, like Namuki or Zuno.
22	2	When they answer your call for help,\nit's a way to bring out the best in\neveryone, don't you think?
23	2	And when that happens,\nyour team becomes one.
24	2	That's why I think you're perfectly\nsuited to being team leader.
25	WY1	M-Mio... Thank you.
26	2	Sure, you might feel small compared\nto other leaders like Foots and Zakir...
27	2	but you're your own person, Kyrie.\nHave some more faith in yourself.
28	WY1	...You're brilliant as always, Mio.
29	WY1	Those words really gave me\nthe warm fuzzies... I feel so\nmuch more motivated now!
30	2	Hehe. Sounds like I did a proper\njob of teaching you, then. I'm glad.
31	WY1	I feel so restless now! I need to run!
32	2	Well then, for our final activity, how\nabout a race back to the colony?
33	WY1	Sounds good!
34	WY1	Last one back's a rotten egg!

1	3	Well, why if it isn't Ysorra. What's up?
2	ZY1	Um... There's something I wanted to ask...
3	ZY1	You used to be a Healer, didn't you?
4	3	Mm, yeah, I did. I'm a jack-of-all-trades\nsince joining Ouroboros, though.
5	ZY1	So then, did you know lots about\nmedicine and treatments and stuff?
6	3	Uh, I remember the basics, but I wouldn't\nsay I'm an expert... I know just the\nminimum amount to be a Healer.
7	3	Why? Do you wanna be a Healer?
8	ZY1	Not a Healer, exactly... Promise you\nwon't laugh at me if I tell you...?
9	3	Eh...?
10	ZY1	I want to be a military doctor!
11	3	*You* want to be a military doctor...?
12	ZY1	Mmm... I knew it... It's weird, isn't it?
13	3	No, no, my bad. That's not what I meant.\nIt's just a little surprising, coming from you.
14	ZY1	Yeah... I know what you mean...
15	ZY1	Everyone thinks I'm just like Foots\nand Nagumo, probably just 'cause\nI'm in the same team as them...
16	ZY1	Whenever I mention I actually want to be\na doctor, Foots just makes fun of me,\nand Nagumo is so annoying about it...
17	3	O-oh, right... That sounds tough, love...
18	ZY1	I've been studying in secret, but there's\nonly so much self-study you can do...
19	3	Ohhh, I get it. That's why you\ncame to me for answers.
20	3	But still, I'm not sure I'd really\nbe much use to you... Sorry, love.
21	ZY1	No, please, I should be the sorry one!\nThank you for listening, anyway!
22	3	Poor clod...
evt/nq/msg_nq020701s.json
0	3	Hey, Teach. Can I bend your ear? Seems\nlike Ysorra wants to be a medical doctor.
1	J	Oh, my... That's the first I've heard of it.
2	3	Apparently she's been studying by\nherself, but she's finding it difficult.\nIsn't there anyone who could teach her?
3	J	Hrm... I think I may have just the solution.
4	2	Oh really?
5	J	We can try and find a special instructor\nin the field, outside of the colony.
6	4	Ah, yes... I have heard of such a system.
7	J	There's no shame at all in asking others\nto fill in when nobody has the experience.\nKnowledge is power, after all.
8	3	In this case, we should try and find\nsomeone who's also a medical doctor.
9	6	I'm trying to think if we know any\ndoctors... Maybe Oleshandra from 4?
10	1	Oh yeah, her... I think she might have\nher hands full with some other work,\nbut there's no harm in asking.
11	J	I'll accompany you, then. I should be there\non behalf of Colony Gamma, so that it all\ngoes through the proper channels.
12	3	OK, then. It's settled!
13	1	Let's go and see Oleshandra.
evt/nq/msg_nq020702f.json
0	yZ1	Oh dear, do you have an upset stomach?\nYou look perfectly healthy to me, though.
1	3	You're right. I'm full o' beans!
2	1	We have something we wanted\nto ask you about, Oleshandra.
3	J	Delighted to meet you. My name is Teach.
4	yZ1	"Teach"...?\nYou're from Colony Gamma, right?
5	J	Forgive me for rudely imposing, but Mio\nand her friends said I might be able to ask\na favor of you.
6	yZ1	...OK, I understand. You're very enthusiastic\nabout teaching, aren't you, Commander?
7	J	What do you think? Would you be able\nto share your experiences and expert\ntechniques with our Ysorra?
8	yZ1	...I totally agree with your principles, and\nI have nothing against helping you out\neven though you're an Agnian colony.
9	J	Well, then-
10	yZ1	However...if I have to leave the colony\ngrounds, it's a different story. I lead the\nmedic team. I can't leave my post.
11	3	Yeah... That makes sense.

13	yZ1	He's not the most experienced of us, but\nhe knows what it takes to be a military\ndoctor. Would that be OK?
14	J	Yes, I have absolute faith in your\nrecommendation. We'd be very\ngrateful for your support!

2	zZ1	...Actually, hold on a second!
3	yZ1	Do you have a problem with that?
4	zZ1	Not a problem, exactly...but isn't\nColony Gamma an...Agnian colony...?
5	J	Not to worry. Our Flame Clock has\nbeen destroyed. We're in the same\nposition as you.
6	yZ1	That means there's no chance of them\ncausing you any harm, Maybach.\nThere should be no issue.
7	zZ1	Mm... I understand your logic, but...
8	yZ1	You're an excellent assistant, but you're\na little dependent on me sometimes.
9	yZ1	This would be a great chance to\nget you some worldly experience.
10	zZ1	Captain Oleshandra!
11	zZ1	...OK, I understand.
12	zZ1	I'm not sure how much help I'll be,\nbut I'll see what I can do.
13	J	Thank you very much. We welcome\nyou to our colony with open arms.

3	3	You said you wanted to be a military\ndoctor, right? So I brought you one!
4	zZ1	N-nice to meet you...
5	3	Don't worry. Maybach is a friend of ours.\nThere's nothing to be scared of.
6	ZY1	U-um... So what's going on?
7	3	You said you hit a wall studying alone\nto become a doctor, right?
8	3	I can't help you, but this guy can.\nYou can ask him anything you like.
9	ZY1	You really went out of your way for me...\nThank you, Eunie!

11	ZY1	Oh, yes! My name is Ysorra!
12	zZ1	Hello, Ysorra. I'm Maybach.\nNice to formally meet you...
13	ZY1	N-nice to meet you, too!
14	zZ1	Let's get started, then... Is there\nanything you want to ask me?
15	ZY1	...Yes! I'd like to know about medical\napproaches to treating different symptoms...
16	zZ1	Ah, yes... OK. That's a pretty broad topic,\ndepending on your progress so far. First,\nlet's start with a case study...

18	J	I just hope that her determination\nbears fruit!
19	J	By the way, Eunie...\nThank you once again for all this.
20	J	You took notice of Ysorra's real goals\nand made every effort to help her.
21	J	As Gamma Commander I must thank you,\nfrom the bottom of my heart.

0	dW1	The principal function of Colony 0\nis to maintain the state of war\nbetween Keves and Agnus.
1	dW1	As a result, our activities cover all Aionios,\nand we seldom stop in one place.
2	1	Wait, you don't have any designated\npoints for rest and refueling?
3	dW1	Correct. All required preparations\nare performed ad hoc.
4	3	Oof, don't like the sound of that.\nThat'll wreck your health.
5	2	There's no need to follow orders now.\nHow about looking for a place for you\nto settle down?
6	6	I'm with Mimi on this.\nHow about it, Segiri?
7	dW1	...I have also considered improvement\nof residential environment as a matter\nof high priority.
8	dW1	Procurement of a safe location\nis desirable for the sake of all present.
9	2	But we'll have to convince\nanother colony to take them in.
10	4	...That won't be an easy task.
11	4	Any discussion would be likely\nto reveal Colony 0's origin.
12	4	They'd have to be careful not to let\nany of this slip to anyone besides us.
13	dW1	...
14	3	That would be hard to\nkeep up even in the City.
15	5	And the Castles would be a bust too.\nWell, it is what it is, I guess...
16	1	Did you say 'the Castles'?
17	1	Lanz, that's it!
18	5	What's it?
19	1	The prison camp at Agnus Castle.
20	1	It's a better place to live than some colony\nthey'd have trouble fitting in with, right?
21	5	Ohhh, right!
22	5	...Wait, are you being serious?!
23	6	Yeah, come on, Noah! We can't settle\npoor Segiri and her friends there!
24	1	Do you think it's a bad idea?
25	dW1	Permission to disagree. This\nis a reasonable proposition.
26	dW1	It satisfies conditions for survival\nand provides sturdy defenses against\nhostile parties.
27	dW1	Existence of a more suitable\nlocation for Colony 0 is unlikely.
28	6	Oh, really? Um, well.\nIf you think it would be good, then...
29	4	Sorry to rain on your military parade,\nbut the prison camp is under the\ncontrol of the Castle right now.
30	4	I think it's already been abandoned, but\nbefore we do anything hasty, we should\ndiscuss our options thoroughly.
31	1	Right, Taion. First things first, let's see if\nwe can get permission from Agnus Castle.

1	dW1	Li Garte Prison Camp\nis a suitable residence.
2	dW1	But the prison environment exerts\na certain unconscious toll.
3	5	A what now?
4	4	Sleeping in a barracks and sleeping\nin a prison are different things,\non a mental level.
5	4	And for extremely wary people like\nthem, the mental pressure is greater.
6	2	So it's a problem of mental health.
7	1	I'm really sorry, Segiri. We should\nhave thought this through more...
8	dW1	Failure to anticipate this turn of\nevents is on my shoulders, not yours.
9	dW1	Responsibility for the team falls on me,\nand I am the one who failed to consider\nthe issues from all angles.
10	5	That means we're house-hunting\nagain though, doesn't it?
11	6	...
12	6	Or we could just change it up a little.
13	3	Change what up, though?
14	6	Like, the fact that people feel like\nthey're in jail?

2	3	Yeah. The others must already be on their\nway back to prison-sweet-prison.
evt/nq/msg_nq030309t.json
0	tY1	Especially now, the monsters inhabiting\nthis area are a useful tool in keeping\nus safe from outsiders.
1	tY1	But if we continue to let their numbers\ngrow unchecked, then we'll be the ones\nunder threat.
2	tY1	It's about time we did something about it.
evt/nq/msg_nq030310t.json
0	lY1	The prison is currently facing\na problem we can't afford to ignore.
1	lY1	I'm sure that No. 7 will approach\nyou with the details soon.
2	lY1	But either way, at some point\nwe might need to rely on you\nOuroboros again.
evt/nq/msg_nq030311t.json
0	nY1	I hope everyone's fine...\n...I'm sure everyone's fine!\n...Right...?
evt/nq/msg_nq030312t.json
0	rY1	How long are they going to make me wait?\nYou'd think dividing those small fry into\nthree would be enough.
evt/nq/msg_nq030313t.json
0	vY1	No. 15 will be fine. This is completely\nnormal for him, haha.
evt/nq/msg_nq030314t.json

evt/nq/msg_nq030400s.json
0	6	Phew... Well, that sure was a surprise.
1	2	But it looks like you were right, Sena.\nThere was someone inside after all.
2	dW1	The person you encountered\nwas likely to have been No. 15.
3	6	No. 15? Wait, did I miss something?\nWas there a No. 15?
4	4	If memory serves, we haven't\nmet No. 15 yet.
5	5	...Ahhh, I remember! Must be the one\nwho went straight back home after\nthe monster hunt.
6	3	Why would anyone get in a Ferron\nwhen they're not fighting, though?
7	dW1	The control mechanisms of a Ferron\ninclude an advanced operations processor.
8	dW1	No. 6 informs that some kind of data\nanalysis is currently in progress,\nusing this equipment.
9	1	I still find it hard to believe that we\nhaven't seen a glimpse of them\nin all this time.
10	dW1	According to the information\navailable to me...
11	dW1	No. 15 has not debarked from\nhis Ferron since arrival at the prison.
12	6	...Wow.
13	3	That just ain't right.
14	dW1	There is no cause for concern. This\nbehavior falls within No. 15's normal-
15	6	Stop right there! There is huge cause\nfor concern! We have to do something!
16	3	Yeah, he's gonna end up a wreck!\nWe'll get him out even if we have\nto drag him kicking and screaming!
17	dW1	...No. 15 does not appreciate\ninterference by third parties.
18	4	You must know that we're not just\ngoing to leave this.
19	dW1	...Was my judgment incorrect?
20	2	Well, to confirm that we'll just\nhave to talk to him first.
21	dW1	...Acknowledged.
evt/nq/msg_nq030403f.json
0	dW1	No. 15. Please respond.
1	pY1	...State your business.
2	5	Whoa, an answer!
3	dW1	No. 15, there are concerns that\nspending so long in a Ferron may\nhave adverse health effects.
4	dW1	Recommend to debark\nfor a short break.
5	pY1	...I will, once I've reached a\npoint I can pause this operation.
6	dW1	Request for estimated timeframe.
7	pY1	Er. Unknown? But I'm positive\nit will be at a...later time.
8	pY1	Will that be all?
9	dW1	I, um... Acknowledged?
10	pY1	Right then.\nI'll return to my task.
11	dW1	...
12	4	...There's not much\none can say to that.
13	nY1	...No. 7, what's wrong?
14	dW1	Ah, No. 3... It-
15	pY1	...Gah, No. 3!
16	nY1	That voice... Is that No. 15?\nYou're shut away in there again?
17	nY1	Are you getting plenty to eat?\nHave you washed? Do you\nhave a change of clothing?
18	pY1	Ugh, none of this is your concern!\nI can do what I want.
19	nY1	It is my concern though! Don't you know\neveryone's worried about you?
20	pY1	Look, the mission's over, isn't it?\nYou're really bugging me, so just\nleave me alone.
21	nY1	(sniff) The rules say, "do not address\nothers in a cruel manner". I just... (sob)
22	pY1	Ugh...!
23	nY1	No. 15, please... All I'm asking is for\nyou to show your face from time to time.
24	nY1	If you don't, and something dreadful -\nbut hypothetical - happens...
25	nY1	then you might die all alone in there\nand nobody will know a thing!
26	pY1	As if that would ever happen!!!
27	nY1	B-but-
28	pY1	Ughhh! Just shut uuuup!
29	pY1	All right, you know what? Fine!\nYou win, I'll get out of this thing!
30	nY1	You will? Really?
31	dW1	Are your intentions truly honest?!
32	pY1	Quit repeating yourselves!
33	pY1	And No. 7? Since I'm totally doing\nthis under duress, you need to help\nme with something.
34	dW1	Compliance. What do you require?
35	pY1	I'll need Ouroboros over there, too.
36	6	Whuh...? Us?
37	pY1	I wasn't lying before.\nI really can't stop this now.
38	pY1	This data is essential. Any gaps will result\nin huge costs in terms of processing time.
39	3	Fascinating. Do me a favor\nand skip to the end.
40	pY1	Ugh, dumbass normies...
41	pY1	No. 7, I've designated some hostiles you\nneed to suppress. Bring me the combat\ndata from your Ferron when you do.
42	pY1	I've sent you the list of targets\nand the data-collection plugin.
43	dW1	Compliance. Confirming receipt.
44	6	OK, so...?
45	pY1	Oh, for the love of spark!\nSO.
46	pY1	That means, go with No. 7 and\nbeat up some bad guys!
47	6	C-compliance!
evt/nq/msg_nq030404f.json
0	pY1	...
1	dW1	No. 15...
2	pY1	I'm listening. Just going through\nyour combat data.
3	pY1	...All dummy reactor operations normal.\nOutput coefficients converging within\nnormal parameters.
4	pY1	No abnormalities found...\nLet me just double-check.
5	dW1	No. 15, we had-
6	pY1	Yes, yes, fine, I'm coming out now.
7	pY1	There you go, I'm out. As ordered.\nHappy now?
8	dW1	Happiness confirmed, No. 15. The sight of\nyou looking so healthy is a relief.
9	pY1	...Hmmm.
10	dW1	Is something weighing on you?
11	pY1	Nothing. I just never knew you\ncould be so concerned for others.
12	dW1	That is-
13	pY1	Well, whatever. It's nothing to do with me.
14	pY1	I need rest now. Wake me up\nwhen the rations are prepared.
15	6	Excuse me!
16	pY1	No. 7, permission to sigh in resignation?
17	6	OK, so it's just, I was wondering\nwhat you're actually so busy with\ninside the Ferron.
18	pY1	How to explain in a way\nnormies would understand?
19	pY1	I'm scanning for irregularities in\nthe dummy reactors of all Ferrons.
20	dW1	The dummy reactors serve as a\nreplacement power source for the\nFerrons in place of the Flame Clock.
21	pY1	Heh. And their creator?\nThe one and only No. 15.
22	1	Then you're the one we have to thank\nfor the Ferrons being operational?
23	pY1	Well I won't lie, I had to slap these\ntogether pretty quickly. Running them\nis kind of risky.
24	pY1	But without Ferrons we won't be\nable to engage in combat.
25	pY1	That's why I had to adjust them quickly\nand guarantee that the power supply\nwas adequate.
26	pY1	If they failed during battle,\nwe'd be dead for sure.
27	dW1	But you have been working constantly\nto support us, so this does not occur.\nYou have my gratitude, No. 15.
28	pY1	I-it's not like that!
29	pY1	I just don't want people to die because\nof my reactors...
30	3	...Real convincing, mate.
31	pY1	Tch. If you don't need me for\nanything else, I'm kind of pooped from\npulling an all-nighter, so...
32	dW1	Of course. Rest well, No. 15.

3	6	Heeey! Is anybody there?\nHellooooo?
4	jn1	Shut uuup!!!
5	6	Oh my sparks!
6	5	What the what?!
7	jn1	...
8	6	What in the world was that...?
evt/nq/msg_nq030500s.json
0	5	Hey, Sena... Did that No. 9 have\nsome beef with you or something?
1	6	What? How did you know- Wait,\nyou didn't see us, did you?
2	3	Frankly, everyone knows already.\nYou do something to piss her off?
3	6	No...! Well, I didn't mean to. We'd never\nhad a proper conversation before that.
4	1	Speaking of No. 9...I remember her arguing\nwith her comrades when they were trying\nto cull the monster population.
5	3	In that case, maybe she just\nhas a short fuse or something?
6	2	You think...? I have the feeling there's\nmore to it than that...
7	4	I'm sure they all have their reasons.\nWe shouldn't get too involved.
8	5	Yeah, but it's bloody awkward to leave\nmisunderstandings unresolved, 'specially\nseeing how she can be so openly hostile...
9	6	I agree... I think we should try talking to\nher again and bring it up subtly.
evt/nq/msg_nq030501f.json
0	nY1	Um, excuse me...!
1	6	Huh? Who are you again...?
2	nY1	S-sorry to bother you. I just wanted\nto talk to you about, um, about No. 9...
3	nY1	Earlier, you and No. 9...um...
4	6	Ah, yeah... I guess I really\nriled her up somehow, huh?
5	nY1	Th-this might be rude\nof me to say, but...
6	nY1	Please don't think badly\nof her, if at all possible.
7	nY1	She's been really on edge lately,\nthough I don't know what about...
8	6	You mean she wasn't like that before?
9	nY1	No, she wasn't...
10	2	Do you have any idea if\nsomething happened...?
11	nY1	I don't, no... I thought of trying\nto ask her, but I was scared\nshe'd only blow up at me...
12	6	Hmm... Hey, if you don't\nmind me asking...
13	6	...could you help us try and\nmake up with her?
14	nY1	Huh? You want *me* to help...?
15	6	Yeah. I bet if we can fix whatever she's\nworried about, we'll be able to fix\nthe whole misunderstanding with us, too.
16	6	You want to get along with\nNo. 9 again too, don't you?
17	nY1	Y-yes, of course! If I can help\nwith whatever's bothering her,\nI'll do my very best...!
18	nY1	But what can we even do...?
19	6	U-ummm... Good question.
20	4	If No. 3 noticed that No. 9 has been\nacting off, then others must have too.
21	4	Why not try asking them for input?\nWithout letting No. 9 know, of course.
22	6	Taion...?
23	4	...What? We're already involved to some\nextent. It's too late to back out now.
24	5	Well then, let's go with Taion's idea\nfor now. That all right with you, Sena?
25	6	...Yeah, sure. Let's get the ball rollin'!
26	6	Oh, wait, No. 3. Wanna come with us?
27	nY1	...A-affirmative!
evt/nq/msg_nq030502f.json
0	1	Huh? What's an off-seer's flute\ndoing in a place like this...?
1	nY1	Ah...! That's No. 9's flute,\nno doubt about it!
2	6	How do you know that?
3	nY1	Well, if you look closely, the tip\nhas a "9" carved into it.
4	nY1	No. 9 always puts a nine\nlike that on her belongings.
5	6	...Even on her Ferron?
6	nY1	Um, yes... Only where\nnobody can see it, though.
7	3	Do you think she's been\nlooking for this flute, then?
8	2	Maybe she couldn't find it and had to\ngo off to the prison camp without it...?\nAnd that's why she's so off-kilter?
9	nY1	No. 9... Why did she even have an\noff-seer flute in the first place...?
10	5	That thing's done for, anyway...\nSomeone battered the crap out of it.
11	3	Yeah. I'm sure she'd properly blow her\ntop if we showed this to her now...
12	6	Mm... You might be right.
13	1	...Either way, let's try and get it fixed\nbefore we go and give it to her.
14	6	You think it can be fixed?
15	1	I heard that there's an expert instrument\ncraftsman when I trained at Keves Castle.
16	1	I think the craftsman might still be in\nFort O'Virbus... Let's go and find out.
evt/nq/msg_nq030503f.json
0	Yf1	Meh-meh? And who might friends be?
1	1	Are you the craftsman named Giddygiddy?\nWe have a request for you.
2	Yf1	Oh ho ho! Friend is off-seer?\nWant after new flute, then?
3	nY1	Um, no... Actually, we wanted to ask\nif you could fix this one here...
4	Yf1	Haha, me sees, me sees.\nLet Giddygiddy take little look.
5	Yf1	Mmmm... This flute suffer from\ntremendous case of battering.
6	5	Can you not fix it, then?
7	Yf1	Hrmm... Giddygiddy can fix\nwhatever Giddygiddy puts mind to.
8	Yf1	However, would be much faster\nto just make new one, meh.
9	1	Well, yes, we figured, but-
10	nY1	Excuse me! If you don't mind, please\ncould you just try and fix that one?
11	Yf1	Hrm...? Well, if friend insist on insisting,\nGiddygiddy will do his best.
12	Yf1	However, friends must need bring\nHarmony Ebony to fix this flute.
13	1	Harmony Ebony?
14	Yf1	Is extremely precious timber\nfindable in Maktha Wildwood.
15	Yf1	For mend such brokenest of flutes,\nthere no way but use natural glue\nmade of Harmony Ebony resin.
16	1	Got it. So we just need to\nbring some of that to you?
17	Yf1	That right. When it is found by friends,\nplease to bring back here to Giddygiddy.

1	Yf1	Well then, without one more ado,\nGiddygiddy shall begin the repairing.
2	Yf1	Meh-meh, reparation complete.\nGlossy and good as new.

1	rY1	...What? Did you have nothing better to do\nthan pile in on me just to give me lip?
2	nY1	N-no, of course not. We just\nwanted to give you this...
3	rY1	...Ah! My flute...!\nWhere did you find this?!
4	nY1	It was at the site of our old camp. You've\nbeen looking hard for it, haven't you?
5	rY1	No...! Well, yes, but...\nYou see, I...
6	rY1	...Wait, what? It looks kinda\nprettier than it was before...
7	6	It was broken when we found it,\nso we had it fixed for you before\nreturning it.
8	rY1	Uh...
9	6	Was that...the wrong thing to do?
10	rY1	I...
11	nY1	N-No. 9? Are you mad at us...?
12	rY1	A-am *I* mad...? Of course not!\nYou're the one who should be mad!
13	rY1	I treated you so badly! I said\nso many mean things to you!
14	rY1	Don't you hate me for that?!\nAnd yet you did this...!
15	nY1	What...? Why do you say that?\nOf course I don't hate you.
16	rY1	No. 3...!
17	nY1	I-I'm sorry! So you are mad\nat me after all...
18	rY1	...Don't be an idiot.
19	rY1	You've done so much for me.\nWhat is there to be mad about...?
20	rY1	Hey, No. 3.
21	nY1	Wh-what is it, No. 9?
22	rY1	...I'm sorry for ripping into you\nall those times...
23	nY1	Huh...?

25	rY1	I'll make sure I never lose it again.
26	nY1	Oh, No. 9...!
27	rY1	A-anyway, that's all I wanted to say!\nThis conversation's over! Bye!
28	nY1	...I'm so glad that went well...
29	6	For sure. Hopefully that resolved\nher misunderstanding with us, too-
30	rY1	I'll only say this once!\nOur beef is totally different, so\ndon't you *dream* we're good now!
31	6	Seriously?!
32	rY1	Don't get all up yourself just because\nNo. 7 likes you a little!
33	rY1	'Cause No. 7...\nbelongs to *us*!
34	rY1	So don't go getting the wrong idea!
35	6	What the...? Why this...?
36	3	Say... Was that "angry"...?\n'Cause to me it looked more like...
37	4	Yes. I think she was just plain jealous.

1	6	Oh, nothing... It's nothing, sorry!
2	rY1	Huh...? Are you trying to make a fool of\nme? Or are you trying to start a fight?

1	nY1	Yeah... Do you know why, No. 8?\nYou work together pretty often.
2	tY1	Hmm...
3	tY1	...Try the camp at Captocorn Peak.
4	nY1	Oh? Why's that...?
5	tY1	When we were there, No. 9 went on way\nmore patrols than she needed to.
6	tY1	Now that I think about it...\nit wasn't like her at all.
7	6	Maybe something about that place\nwas weighing heavy on her mind...?
8	tY1	If I remember correctly, that's about when\nshe started becoming more aggressive.
9	tY1	Or, well... She's always been kind of\nlike that, but she does seem to have\ngotten more emotionally unstable.
10	2	...I don't know what it was, but I'm sure\nsomething must have happened to her.
11	1	We can't go right up and ask her, so\nthere's only one thing we can do.
12	4	...Check out the scene?
13	nY1	You mean, leave the prison camp?\nY-you don't have to do all that...
14	3	Don't worry 'bout it.\nWe'll protect you!

4	6	H-huh? With Segiri...?
5	rY1	Why're you so evasive, huh?!\nIt's so annoying! And also, I can't\nstand to look at you!
6	6	Whoa...
7	rY1	Stay out of our business! You don't\neven know us! Got it?!
8	6	Y-yes...? OK? I'm...sorry...?
9	rY1	...Hmph!
10	6	That was...No. 9, I think...?

evt/nq/msg_nq030600s.json
0	6	Hey, Segiri, there's something\nI've been meaning to ask you...
1	dW1	Yes?
2	6	When we were searching for relics,\nwhat exactly were you and your friends\ndoing there?
3	dW1	"Relics"... Hypothesis: are you\nreferring to Mission SLV509?
4	6	Um... Probably?
5	dW1	Recovering relics related to the civilization\nof the old world was a further one of\nColony 0's main duties.
6	4	What's the "old world"?
7	dW1	That is what Consul F used to call this\nworld before it fell into the present war.
8	dW1	Furthermore, we were under strict orders\nto prevent either Keves or Agnus from\ndiscovering them.
9	dW1	That is because the relics were thought to\ncontain an element dangerous enough that\nit could bring an end to the war.
10	5	Are you messing with us...? Just\nwhat the spark were you recovering?!
11	dW1	Waste matter with no clear use,\npaper-like carbide materials,\nstone objects of unclear model type...
12	1	...So just a bunch of rubbish, then?
13	6	Yeah, most of the relics we came\nacross were like that, too...
14	dW1	We were instructed to immediately\ndispose of any we came across, so I\nalso lack clear data on them.
15	3	So they're shrouded in mystery...\nThis just got kinda interesting!
16	dW1	Identification and disposal of the relics\nwas mainly No. 8's responsibility.
17	dW1	I suggest enquiring with No. 8 about the\ndetails if you are so inclined.
18	6	All right, let's ask No. 8 about\nit if we get the chance.
evt/nq/msg_nq030601f.json
0	tY1	...Need something?
1	6	Oh, um, well... It's nothing that\nimportant, but...
2	6	Segiri told us that you were in charge\nof collecting relics, way back when.
3	tY1	...Ah!
4	6	We found something similar, so I thought\nwe'd pick your brains, if you don't mind.
5	tY1	...We destroyed whatever we found right\nthere on the spot. No exceptions.
6	6	Really...?
7	tY1	That was the job. There's nothing else\nI can tell you. I don't know anything else.
8	6	I-I see... Well, that sure does suck,\nbut no worries.
9	tY1	...Why are you asking about this now?
10	6	No big reason. I guess\nI was just...curious?
11	tY1	You were curious... Is that really all?
12	6	Y-yeah, no ulterior motives...
13	tY1	...Understood.
14	tY1	Follow me.
15	6	W-wait a second! Don't speed off like that!
16	tY1	There is something I want to show\nyou in the storehouse.
17	3	...Queen's calves, this guy\nis a mystery to me.
18	2	I wonder what he wants to show us?
19	5	Me too... Let's follow him and find out.
evt/nq/msg_nq030602f.json
0	tY1	...Over here.
1	6	What is this...?
2	5	It's a super-dirty piece of wood.\nSo this is what you wanted to show us?
3	tY1	This is apparently called...a "painting".\nIt is one of the relics I recovered.
4	5	Ahhh, I remember paintings!\nSo this is one of those, huh?
5	3	Ohhh, a painting... Wait, what?
6	2	Hey, hold on a minute. Didn't you\nsay you destroyed all the relics?
7	tY1	...According to Consul F, this painting\ndepicts a "threat to world order".
8	tY1	Then I was ordered to dispose of it...\nbut it weighed on my mind.
9	tY1	I wondered what this painting must depict,\nto make the Consul tell me all of that.
10	tY1	So I went and, uh...kept the painting,\nhidden behind closed doors...
11	5	You little thief! Hahaha!\nI'm takin' a shining to you now!
12	4	Now I see. You wanted to know if\nwe were going to prosecute this\nindiscretion of yours.
13	tY1	...The only other person who\nknows this is here is No. 10.
14	tY1	Since I hid it, No. 10 has been looking\nfor ways to get it fixed between missions.
15	tY1	Recently, we pinned down the location\nof someone in the City who may have\nthe means to repair relics.
16	1	In the City, you say?
17	tY1	Indeed... I need to send this off\nto No. 10 in the City, but...
18	tY1	I was wondering if you'd do it for me.
19	5	Us? Why can't you take it there?
20	tY1	No. 6 ordered me to guard the camp...\nso I can't leave my post.
21	3	Well, aren't you a conscientious worker...\nI guess I don't mind taking it for you.
22	tY1	...You have my gratitude.
23	tY1	No. 10 tried to blend in with the people in\nthe City. First, you must link up with her.
24	6	Got it. Then we just have\nto hand over the painting, right?
25	tY1	Yes...
26	tY1	Hm...
27	2	Is there anything else you wanted to say?
28	tY1	I... I do not know if this is suitable\ncompensation for this favor, but...
29	tY1	if the painting comes back fixed...\nthen I promise I will show it to you all.

0	vY1	Oh my, what's going on here?\nWhat have you all popped up for?
1	6	We're here in No. 8's place.\nBy the way, what are you wearing...?
2	vY1	Oh, this? It's Colony 0's stock disguise,\nfor use when going undercover!
3	4	I'm surprised that your colony had\nmilitary uniform disguises in stock.
4	vY1	Um, yeah. Anyway, I assume No. 8\nhas caught you up on the situation?
5	1	Yes, we're all caught up. We brought\nthe painting, just like we were asked.
6	vY1	Roger that! OK then, follow me.
7	6	Where are we going?
8	vY1	To the person who can fix it, of course.
9	vY1	With the esteemed Ouroboros lined up\nbehind me, I'm sure nothing can go wrong!
10	3	That's a loooot of optimism, there...\nWell, all we can do is press on. Let's go.
11	vY1	I'll guide you there. After me, please!
evt/nq/msg_nq030604f.json
0	bl1	Why, hello there, kids.\nFancy running into you like this!
1	6	Leeanne? What's going on here...?
2	vY1	Oh, you know each other already? Mega!\nLooks like I was right to bring you along.
3	1	Is this really the painting-repair-person?\nThe Leeanne we know was-
4	vY1	Ahaha, I know what you're going to say!\nJust watch and listen.
5	vY1	Excuse me. I have a request\nfor one Miss Leeanne?
6	bl1	Hrm... I've never seen you around\nbefore, kid. What's your request?
7	vY1	Before you became a novelist,\nyou restored relics to preserve\nthe City's cultural history, right?
8	bl1	Wow, that sure takes me back!\nThat was ages ago now. You've got\na good memory... Why do you ask?
9	vY1	I was actually wondering if you could\nmend my relic... Here, take a look.
10	bl1	Hohoh, oh wow, look at this...\nThis is a fine specimen you've got here.
11	bl1	Hrmmm... A painting, eh?\nIt looks immeasurably valuable, but\nit's rather damaged, I'm afraid.
12	6	Do you think you can fix it?
13	bl1	Weeell, it won't be straightforward,\nbut I think I could give it a crack.
14	4	Why don't you walk us through it?
15	bl1	First, I can remove all the dirt\nfrom it with a special solvent.
16	bl1	Then I'll need the same paints and tools\nto restore the faded parts.
17	bl1	If I can get my hands on the\nsolvent and the pigments,\nthen I'll give it my best shot.
18	vY1	Snuff yeah...! A-ahem. I mean,\nthank you very much, Miss Leeanne.
19	bl1	Hahaha, don't mention it. I'm just\nhappy that you youngsters still have\nsome interest in culture these days.
20	1	Where can we find the things you need?
21	bl1	The Metessia Resin I need for the\nsolvent should be somewhere\nin the Maktha Wildwood.
22	bl1	As for the paint, I'll need to get it by\nsmashing a Seven-Hue Seashell...\nThat'll be a bit trickier.
23	bl1	Some monsters called Ottils in the\nCadensia region have been known\nto hoard such shells.
24	bl1	Finding the shells yourself will be hard.\nIt might seem cruel, but your fastest bet is\nto defeat some Ottils and take their shells.
25	1	Roger that. So we need Metessia Resin\nand a Seven-Hue Seashell.
26	bl1	Oh to be so young and spry! Add some\npep in your step, Ouroboros.
27	vY1	I'll stay here and look after the painting.\nSorry and thanks! See you later, gang!
28	5	Yeah, you'd best take good care of it.\nWe don't want anyone *else* to steal it!
evt/nq/msg_nq030605f.json
0	bl1	Did you bring everything? Time for me\nto show my stuff, then. Bear with me,\nit's been a while.
1	1	How long do you think it'll take?
2	bl1	Hrm... Well, it won't be done right\naway, that's for sure.
3	3	Of course, of course.
4	2	In other words, we shouldn't\njust stand here waiting...
5	vY1	I will stay here on standby, then.
6	vY1	I'll bring the painting back to\nthe prison camp once it's fixed!
7	6	OK, gotcha. We'll head back then.
8	bl1	In that case, mind helping me carry\nall of this to my workshop, young lady?
9	vY1	Yes, ma'am.
evt/nq/msg_nq030606f.json
0	vY1	Hey, No. 10's back! Did you miss me?
1	6	Oh, welcome back. You must be tired.
2	tY1	Where's the pa-
3	vY1	My word, are you impatient! I'll get\nright to it and show you, then.
4	1	That's...
5	2	Ah...
6	4	So this is what made Consul F\ncall it a "threat to world order"...?
7	5	Hrmmm, I don't really get it. I was\nimagining something much nastier.
8	6	...Those children look so happy. They\nlook like they all get along so well.
9	2	Yeah... It makes me feel all warm inside.\nWhat a kind and tender scene...
10	3	Yeah, it doesn't seem so bad to me.
11	6	Huh...? What's wrong?
12	tY1	I...
13	vY1	Oh, dearie me! Are you crying, No. 8?
14	tY1	Tell me this, No. 10.\nWhat exactly is the point of Colony 0...?
15	vY1	Hunh...? What sort of question is that?\nAnd why all of a sudden?
16	tY1	Were we fighting...just to erase\n"their" existence from the world?
17	tY1	Was our mission just to destroy the\nhappiness of whoever's in this painting...?
18	tY1	Can we really just excuse...\nsuch a horrible thing...?
19	vY1	Mmm...
20	6	Oh, No. 8...
21	tY1	Did Colony 0...did *we*...\neven need to be born at all...?
22	6	...Hey! Now hold on-
23	vY1	...It's OK, No. 8. You don't have\nto worry about all that.
24	tY1	But... No. 10...!
25	vY1	It may be true that...destroying things\nwas the only way we could live. But...
26	vY1	...from now on, we're going to protect\nthings instead. The world, and its people.
27	vY1	Kids like them... All of it.
28	tY1	We can...protect them...
29	tY1	...Do you think we can change?\nFrom how we've been until now?
30	vY1	I think so. I mean, just look at\nNo. 7. It's obvious we can.
31	tY1	I see... So No. 7 has been\ndoing this for us, all this time...
32	2	I think I understand why Moebius\nthought this painting was so\ndangerous, at least a little bit.
33	6	Yeah... Me too, Mimi.
34	vY1	...Oh! I almost forgot! Miss Leeanne\nkindly gave this painting a name for us.
35	4	A name...? What do you mean?
36	vY1	Apparently, all paintings have to have\na title. Though usually the original artist\ncomes up with it...
37	3	Oooh, I see. Well then, what\nname did Leeanne give it?
38	vY1	Uhm, OK, well, I don't really\nget what it means, but...
39	vY1	...she called it "Siblings".
evt/nq/msg_nq030607t.json
0	lY1	That sparking No. 10... I warned her\nnot to up and leave the camp like that.
1	lY1	No. 8's supposed to be on guard. How on\nAionios did she get past him so easily...?
evt/nq/msg_nq030608f.json

3	qd1	Wheelideeli hear something about\ngoods of great antiquity that\nvalued customers collect...?
4	rY1	Th-that was just our job! And we\ngot rid of them ages ago!
5	qd1	Meh... Great shame. Wheelideeli\nlook forward to next visit.

evt/nq/msg_nq030609t.json
0	tY1	No. 10's already waiting in the City.\nYou just need to arrange the handover.
1	tY1	If it can be restored, then we'll be able\nto see what was painted there...
evt/nq/msg_nq030610t.json
0	vY1	What's that? Where's my Ferron?
1	vY1	Haha, no need to worry about that.\nI've hidden it in a secret place. I'm\nan old hand at undercover missions.
evt/nq/msg_nq030611t.json
0	bl1	The Metessia Resin I need for the solvent\nshould be somewhere in Maktha Wildwood.
1	bl1	For Seven-Hue Seashells, the fastest bet is\nto defeat some Ottils in the Cadensia region.
2	bl1	With those in hand, I should be able to\nfix up that painting of yours. Add some\npep in your step, youngsters!
evt/nq/msg_nq030700s.json
0	dW1	...Sena.\nOnce again, I wish to make a request.
1	6	A request... Uh, to me?
2	dW1	Affirmative.\nYou are uniquely qualified to fulfill it.
3	6	It sounds so formal...\nI gotta admit, I'm kinda nervous.
4	3	Hey, goes to show how much she\ntrusts you, innit. So, whatcha need?
5	dW1	I require assistance in devising what\nyou call..."names".
6	6	Names for who? Or what?
7	dW1	No. 6, No. 3, No. 15...\nAll the members of Colony 0.
8	dW1	Similar to Segiri...I mean, me, they should\nhave names. Not identification numbers.
9	6	Oh!
10	dW1	As you know, the soldiers of Colony 0\nare unfamiliar with the concept\nof "names".
11	dW1	As components required to operate\nFerrons, we did not have the luxury to\nquestion such things...
12	6	Oh, Segiri...
13	dW1	But when you, Sena, told me that\nSegiri could give No. 7 orders...
14	dW1	The moment I reconfigured from No. 7\nto Segiri, I realized there had been an\nerror in my thinking.
15	dW1	I began to confront the simple fact\nthat we are human.
16	6	And that's why you want names\nfor everybody?
17	dW1	If everyone can acquire names and\nbecome more human, they could feel\nthe same as I do.
18	dW1	If we can do that, perhaps our colony\ncan forge a better path than the one\nit is currently on.
19	6	...Aww.
20	dW1	Will you do this for me, Sena?
21	6	When you put it like that...\nI'd love to be all "absolutely", but...
22	5	But...what? What's up?
23	6	I mean, it's kind of a huge\nresponsibility! I have to think\nabout it real carefully...
24	4	This isn't like you, Sena. What happened\nto the gusto with which you invented the\nname "Segiri"?
25	6	That was...! I mean, I was thinking about\nSegiri a lot, and that name just sort of...\npopped into my head.
26	6	A-anyway, Segiri, I'll give this a good\nhard think, so can you give me\na little time?
27	dW1	Of course. You have my gratitude, Sena.
28	2	Why don't we take this opportunity\nto look back on everything that's\nhappened so far?
29	2	The people of Colony 0 have been\nthrough a lot. It might help you come\nup with some names.
30	6	Oh yeah... Good point, Mimi.\nLet's do that then!
31	6	With all that's been going on, we might\nas well take a stroll round the prison.\nI'll come up with something.
32	dW1	Compliance. I will accompany you.
evt/nq/msg_nq030701f.json
0	dW1	I received a report on this relic\nfrom No. 10.
1	dW1	It reminded me of how we got it restored\nin accordance with No. 8's wishes.
2	6	Oh, that's right! That was kinda tough,\nbut since it made him happy, that's really\nall that matters.
3	dW1	No. 8 followed orders with devotion.\nIt is something that No. 6 values highly,\nas someone who respects discipline.
4	dW1	That No. 8 would hide the relic from\nall of us was, frankly speaking,\nquite astonishing.
5	6	Haha, that must have been a shock\nfor you, Segiri.
6	dW1	...On the other hand, it may be that\nthat was the real face of No. 8.
7	dW1	It could be that No. 10 recognized\nthis, and wished to support No. 8's\nwishes.
8	6	I suppose so. Those two might actually\nreally be like two peas in a pod!\nThey were both so curious...
9	dW1	Indeed. Just understanding this,\nI can see that there was a meaning\nto this relic.
10	6	Maybe we could leave the prison grounds?\nStretch our legs?
11	dW1	I have no objections. Where do you\nwish to go?
12	6	Umm. Where was it we all\nwent to together?
13	6	Maktha Wildwood...and then\naround Captocorn Peak?
14	dW1	Compliance.
evt/nq/msg_nq030702f.json
0	6	Have things been OK with the\nmonsters since? They haven't\ngrown in number again or anything?
1	dW1	No issues at present. We work\ntogether in two-man shifts to cull\ntheir numbers.
2	6	Cool! You guys are pretty strong,\nI bet you don't have any problems\nwhen you work together!
3	dW1	Your bet is...not entirely accurate.
4	dW1	Conflicts do arise, depending on\nthe pairing...such as with No. 9 and No. 3.
5	dW1	Such issues did not arise under the\nConsul's command. His control of us\nwas...most rigorous.
6	6	Hmm. I guess just because you're\ncomrades doesn't mean you've gotta\nget along all the time.
7	6	Or maybe... Maybe it's *because* they're\ncomrades that they argue sometimes.
8	6	I mean, like, there's times I get into\narguments with Mimi, too.
9	dW1	...You do?
10	6	It wasn't always that way. I think we used\nto avoid it. You know, subconsciously.
11	6	But now we're at a place where we both\nfeel we can tell each other whatever we\nhave that needs to be said.
12	6	I guess if that's the result, then the\nodd fight isn't such a bad thing, huh?
13	dW1	I had never considered the issue from\nthis perspective. I must process.
14	6	Segiri, if there's ever anything you\nwanna say to me, I don't want you\nto hold back, OK?
15	6	Oh, and not just with me. I mean with\nthe whole of Colony 0!
16	dW1	I shall try.
evt/nq/msg_nq030703f.json
0	6	Heeey there! Hellooooo!\nCan you hear me?
1	dW1	...Sena. A Ferron is an inanimate object.\nThough it is humanoid in appearance,\nit is not alive.
2	6	No duh, Segiri! I thought maybe\nsomebody was inside...
3	dW1	...I have confirmed No. 15's unit\nis unoccupied at present.
4	6	O-oh yeah? Well, looks like he's\ndoing like we asked.
5	dW1	Indeed. Visual confirmation of No. 15\noccurs on occasion, even within the prison.
6	dW1	Before we came here, he was more\ninclined to avoid social interaction.\nOne might call this a great improvement.
7	6	Segiri, what do you think of No. 15,\npersonally?
8	dW1	At the least, he is a capable soldier.
9	6	"At the least"?
10	dW1	Amendment - I admit I also\ndid not know what to do with him.
11	dW1	Even I could not predict his more\n...idiosyncratic qualities. Understanding\neluded me.
12	dW1	However, I'm learning to understand others\nbetter as I work with them... That incident\nhas awoken this new awareness within me.
13	6	...
14	dW1	No. 15 is a kind person.\nOf that, at least, there is no mistake.
evt/nq/msg_nq030704f.json
0	6	Segiri, how are things between No. 9 and\nNo. 3 since that time?
1	dW1	Recently, I often see them together\nin the prison mess hall.
2	dW1	No. 9 does still become emotional\nat times, but overall they maintain\na satisfactory relationship.
3	6	I'm glad they've managed to repair\ntheir friendship.
4	dW1	No. 9's fluid emotions cause her to\ntake a more aggressive tact with the\nothers.
5	dW1	In spite of this, No. 3 did not give\nup in her attempts to improve relations\nwith No. 9.
6	dW1	I hold great admiration for No. 3's\nsense of perseverance and self-sacrifice.
7	6	Yeah, just talking to her I can tell\nshe really cares about the others.
8	6	And No. 9 is trying to become\nan off-seer for everyone she's lost...
9	6	They're both the same at heart, they've\njust got different ways of showing it.
10	dW1	Until now, I believed that showing\nexcessive emotion would have a detriment\nduring battle...
11	dW1	But with No. 3 and No. 9, I wish them\nto continue living by following their\nfeelings.
12	6	Good, good! That's why I've gotta come\nup with some good names for them, too!
evt/nq/msg_nq030705f.json
0	6	I've gotta thank No. 6 for introducing\nus to Wheelideeli.
1	dW1	I concur. Without No. 6's negotiations,\noutfitting the prison camp would have\nbeen impossible.
2	dW1	I am not the most loquacious of people,\nand I speak most formally... I would have\ncaused misunderstanding, but No. 6...
3	6	Hey, don't worry about it, Segiri!\nYou're a great person too.
4	6	A-anyway, can you tell me a little\nmore about No. 6?
5	6	Like...what sort of name he'd\nbe happy with?
6	dW1	No. 6 dislikes pointless effort.\nHe seeks to be concise in all things.
7	dW1	As such, it may be best to avoid\ngiving him an excessively long name.
8	6	So then it should be something you can\nsay quickly. Kind of like "Sena"!
9	dW1	Also, I would ask you to consider\nsomething, if possible...and not\njust for No. 6.
10	dW1	Names that somehow incorporate\ntheir previous ID numbers.
11	6	You mean like how I got the "Se" in Segiri\nfrom "No. 7"?
12	dW1	Yes...
13	dW1	Perhaps if everyone had a similar source\nfor their name, it would be more equal.\nNo one would have cause to complain.
14	6	...What's the reeeealll reason, though?
15	dW1	...I'd like to be the same as everyone else.
16	6	Hahaha, you got it!\nI think you might be onto something.
17	6	Yep. At this rate I won't need\nmuch longer to come up with some names!
evt/nq/msg_nq030706s.json
0	2	How about it, Sena? Did you\ncome up with names for everybody?
1	6	Yup! Chatting with Segiri let me apply\nsome Sena thinking to the problem!
2	6	I think I've got some names.
3	dW1	Ah! Truly?
4	6	Uh-huh. I just need to think how\nwe'll tell everybody...
5	3	Ah, why don't you just get everybody\ntogether in the Central Cell and hit 'em\nwith their new names?
6	6	I, uh, well... That makes me kinda\nnervous, not gonna lie...
7	dW1	This is an excellent suggestion.\nPlease do that.
8	3	...Guess that's that then!
9	6	Heyyy! This is important, you know!\nDon't make fun of me, please, OK?!
10	dW1	I shall ask everyone to gather.\nThe rest is up to you, Sena.
11	6	Uh, yep! I'll sure do my best...!\nOh sparks...
evt/nq/msg_nq030707f.json
0	tY1	Everyone has gathered. No. 7,\nis there some kind of problem?
1	dW1	No. 8. I am not No. 7 any more.\nCall me Segiri.
2	vY1	Huh? What's that, all of a sudden?
3	lY1	...
4	dW1	All units, hear me. As of this moment...
5	dW1	...I am rescinding all identification numbers\npreviously assigned to Colony 0 soldiers.
6	lY1	Wait. You've mentioned changing\nthe way we refer to you...\nNow it's extending to us as well?
7	dW1	Perhaps you have not considered this,\nbut it is only right that we have names.
8	dW1	Not just me, but all of us. We are\nhuman, just the same as the others\nwho live in this world.
9	tY1	We're...human...?
10	nY1	B-but, this name business is all really\nsudden... What are we supposed to call\nourselves?
11	6	Not to worry! I've given a lot of thought\nto names for you all.
12	rY1	Huh? Why do you get to name us?\nI think that's a little out of line!
13	vY1	Now, now... We can always say no\nafter we hear her out. It might be fun!
14	6	OK, No. 6. You are...
15	6	Ix. What do you think?
16	lY1	Ix? What's up with that?
17	lY1	I mean... Well, wait a minute...\nIx... It's not too bad. I really\nlike how short it is!
18	6	No. 3, you are...Trini!
19	nY1	Trini...\nNo. 3 is Trini...
20	nY1	What's happening? I feel a little tingly...\nIs this what having a name feels like?
21	6	No. 8, you could be called...Eilic.
22	tY1	Eilic...
23	tY1	No. 8 is Eilic... Eilic... Eilic...
24	tY1	I've got it. I'll be Eilic from now on.
25	6	For No. 15, I've got...Biffteen!
26	pY1	Hey, what the...?\nI go to "Biffteen" from "fifteen", really?\nThat's barely any different...!
27	vY1	Ah, I think it's good, Biffteen!\nIt's shorter than saying "number fifteen"\nat any rate.
28	nY1	I think it suits you, No. 15...\nUm, I mean Biffteen!
29	pY1	If you say so, No. 3 - sorry, Trini.
30	6	And you can be...
31	rY1	...
32	6	How do you feel about "Fline"?
33	rY1	...Fline?
34	6	Y-you don't like it?
35	rY1	Hm.
36	rY1	"Fline the Off-Seer".\nI guess that's what they'd\ncall me in the future.
37	rY1	Better than "No. 9 the Off-Seer" anyway.\nThough that's not saying much...
38	rY1	Hmph. Whatever.\nI'll let you have this one, No. 7.\nI mean, Segiri.
39	6	Whoa!
40	vY1	Hey, hey! What about me?\nDon't leave me hanging, what's my name?
41	6	Um, you'll be...Teena!
42	vY1	Teena, eh? Nice!\nWeirdly fitting!
43	dW1	I believe it will take time for us to get\nused to these names, but from now on\nwe should use them for each other.
44	_o1	Compliance, No. 7! ...Oh, oops...
45	ap1	Hahaha! You've already messed up, Ix!
46	Wp1	F...Fline!
47	Yp1	Wh-what?
48	Wp1	Um. Sorry, I just wanted to try it.
49	Yp1	Pfft. Quit being weird, Trini.
50	Zp1	No. 7 is Segiri... No. 6 is Ix...\nNo. 3 is Trini... No. 15 is Buffteen...
51	Xp1	It's "Biffteen", man!
52	1	Looks like they've taken to those names.\nI'm glad for you.
53	6	Thanks! I was real nervous,\nbut it was worth all that hard brain time.
54	6	Did it go about how you expected, Segiri?
55	dW1	Yes. Now that you have given them names,\nit feels like we are finally a unit.
56	dW1	All of us... We are now humans,\nwith real names. We get to start over,\nhere and now.
57	dW1	We and our colony have been reborn.

1	dW1	I have no objections.\nWhere do you wish to go?

3	dW1	Ah!
4	dW1	Apologies, No. 6.\nWhat do you need of me?
5	lY1	You don't seem like yourself, No. 7.\nAre you feeling OK?
6	dW1	Affirmative. Condition green.\nI am completely fine.
7	lY1	Maybe it's a little late for this, but\nperhaps from now I should call you\nSegiri instead of No. 7...
8	dW1	I do not mind either way...
9	lY1	I wouldn't be so sure of that.
10	lY1	I called you No. 7 and for\na moment you didn't even respond.\nThat's proof enough.
11	lY1	If we were in combat just now,\nhow do you think things would turn out?\nDo I need to say more?
12	dW1	...I have no counter-argument.
13	lY1	Honestly, I don't understand this whole\n"name" concept, but I'll leave the decision\nto you.
14	dW1	...Compliance.\nI will give it my consideration.

5	2	Moisture? Shall we bring you some?
6	_Y1	Anything is fine, so long as filled with\nwetness... Panepane dying of dry throat...

1	1	Don't mention it, we're\njust glad you're OK.
2	6	But what actually happened? Why\nwere you all passed out in a place\nlike this?
3	_Y1	It story of great length, so Panepane\nchoose not to tell it.
4	5	...Fair enough. That's fine by us.
5	_Y1	It all start when Panepane on way to\nFerronis hulk on hillside where apprentice\nwait. Panepane fall and belongings smash.
6	_Y1	Everything except hammer which Panepane\ncarry on back get taken and broken by\nmonsters. Panepane flat broke.
7	_Y1	Panepane on last legs, walking,\nwalking, and no drop to drink...
8	5	Oh, so you *are* going to tell us. OK.
9	_Y1	Shillshill, apprentice of Panepane,\nmust be so looking forward to meeting.
10	_Y1	Thanks to friends, Panepane is saved.\nWill rest teensy bit more and then\ngo see apprentice.
11	1	Well, don't overdo it.\nThe roads are dangerous.
12	_Y1	No worry for Panepane. Legs of\nPanepane are very fast for running\naway.
13	4	That won't do you much\ngood if you're horizontal.
14	_Y1	Anyway, Panepane saved now,\nand Panepane pay you back.

0	1	So, just as we finish off solving\nthe resources problem, a pack\nof monsters shows up?
1	6	They said they'd deal with it,\nbut we should help, right?
2	4	And how long are we supposed to hold\ntheir hands? Have you forgotten what\nwe're actually meant to be doing?
3	6	What? No, of course not...!
4	4	Colony 4 problems are for Colony 4\nto solve. Ethel said as much.
5	4	And we're outsiders. The more we meddle,\nthe more they'll be on guard against us.
6	1	...Do you think that what we've\nbeen doing is just meddling?
7	5	Meddling, not-meddling, who\ncares as long as we're helping?
8	2	"The actions you believe to be correct\ndon't always lead to good outcomes."
9	3	...I think I remember Ethel saying that.
10	2	Yes, but think about it.
11	2	Doesn't it mean that if you don't take\nthe action in the first place, you can't\nknow if it's good or bad?
12	6	Oh!
13	4	Mio, you're...
14	1	...She's right, is what she is.\nSitting here wringing our\nhands won't do anything.
15	3	The Colony 4 gang are going\nto be at the Barren Knoll, right?
16	3	That ain't far. We can at least,\nyou know, look in on them.\nMake sure they're handling themselves.
17	2	I agree with Eunie. Taion?
18	4	...No objections. It's a logical conclusion\nfollowing what I originally said.
19	1	Good. We'll do everything we-\nWell. We'll do something, anyway.
evt/nq/msg_nq110101f.json
0	3	Hey, look!
1	1	Let's pitch in!
2	sZ1	What? You...!
3	1	Conversation can wait!\nWe'll take it from here!
evt/nq/msg_nq110102f.json
0	1	How is everyone? No injuries?
1	sZ1	...Why did you help us?
2	5	Do we need a reason?
3	sZ1	Well, Agnus helping out Keves,\nit's unheard-of, isn't it?
4	4	...Your point?
5	tZ1	Do you not get it yet?\nWe. Do. Not. Trust. You.
6	6	...Mimi, it's him...!
7	tZ1	Oh, you again? You just don't die, do you?
8	2	...
9	sZ1	We heard you were in\nclose with the commander.
10	sZ1	But that doesn't mean anyone else\nin Colony 4 trusts you.
11	1	We're not trying to win your\ntrust, you just needed help.
12	sZ1	...What did you say?
13	1	I don't care about obligations.\nI just don't want to turn my back\non anyone who fights for others.
14	1	That's why we stepped in.\nNo more reason than that.
15	sZ1	So you act in accordance\nwith your principles, that's it?
16	tZ1	Ha, that's the best lie an Agnus-lover\nlike you can come up with?
17	1	...Sorry we overstepped\nour bounds. We'll go.
18	sZ1	Ugh... OK, fine. I approve\nof Ethel's judgment.
19	2	Huh?
20	sZ1	I apologize for what I said before.\nI was just trying to test you.
21	tZ1	Come on, Maxie! What are you saying?!
22	sZ1	The commander trusted you\nfrom the start. We have a duty\nto abide by her wishes.
23	uZ1	We heard about the thing with the\nmedical supplies. That was all you.
24	sZ1	Anyway, we may as well introduce\nourselves now. I'm Maxie, tactician\nsquad leader.
25	5	...Good lad, Maxie. Er, so what kind of\ntest were you talking about earlier?
26	sZ1	We wanted to use this opportunity to\nmake sure of something. Whether we\ncould entrust our mission to... Well.
27	3	Er, what?
28	uZ1	Captain, you mean, your\nstrategy was aimed at...them?
29	sZ1	I was pretty sure you'd pass.
30	tZ1	Wait, are you serious\nright now? *Them*?
31	sZ1	Jeremy, I'm not saying this\nmakes up for the past.
32	sZ1	But we can't forget that\nwe're fighting for the living.
33	tZ1	...Tch!
34	sZ1	We're in a critical situation. We need\nto break out of it while we can, and\nwe've got just the plan to do it.
35	sZ1	I want your help to make it happen.
36	1	...Are you sure about this?
37	sZ1	I'll be frank. We don't have the firepower.\nWe're busy shoring up colony defense, so\ntaking out some enemies will help us.
38	sZ1	But more than that...
39	sZ1	I thought that proving your sincerity\nto everyone would be inspiring.
40	2	I see...
41	sZ1	There's some days yet before\nthe operation begins, so just think it over.
42	1	Right.
43	tZ1	...
evt/nq/msg_nq110200s.json
0	1	I wonder what Maxie's plan is.
1	5	Whatever it is, he trusts us now,\nright? Something to celebrate.
2	6	Yeah, it's good to know we haven't just\nbeen yelling into the void. We're...useful.
3	5	...That said, not everyone was happy.
4	3	That Jeremy lad? He's probably\nbeen through a lot.
5	3	And Maxie said it himself. Not everyone's\nready to be bezzies with us.
6	4	In which case, is it wise\nto take him at his word?
7	2	I think we should. Must, even.\nHe's worried about Colony 4, naturally.
8	2	And if we can resolve the\nmisunderstandings about us,\nas Maxie said...
9	6	Well said, Mimi.
10	5	Act first, worry later. Yeah?
11	1	Yeah, there's no point rehashing it.\nWe just need to do what we believe\nis right.
evt/nq/msg_nq110201f.json
0	sZ1	...Wait, you're really going to accept?
1	3	Pfft, come on mate!\nYou're the one who brought it up.
2	sZ1	It's strange for me to say,\nbut it's quite the selfish request.
3	sZ1	Nothing I could have done if\nyou'd changed your minds.
4	5	Do you trust us a bit now?
5	sZ1	I do. I've learned not to be so hasty\nin judging people.
6	1	So what's the plan?
7	sZ1	Essentially, there are three\nmonsters to take out.
8	5	...But not essentially, it won't be easy,\nwhich is why you came to us?
9	sZ1	Good guess. These three\nare pretty big deals.
10	sZ1	They control all the monsters around the\ncolony perimeter. You could say they're\nthe boss monsters.
11	sZ1	We scouted out their lairs, but Colony 4\ndoesn't have the firepower to spare on\nan extermination mission right now.
12	sZ1	Deploying all the squads who are\nmeant to be protecting the colony\nwould be pretty backwards.
13	4	But as long as these bosses\nare running wild, you can't resolve\nthe monster attacks.
14	sZ1	Exactly. So, think you can do it?
15	5	In our sleep! We'll\ntake 'em out in no time.
16	2	Could we find out any more\nabout these monsters...?
17	sZ1	If you want to know more, then you\nshould ask the scouts who found the\nlairs. My team, actually.
18	sZ1	Jeremy, Fla'ran and Yorde are your guys.
19	6	Oh, wait, wasn't Jeremy the\none who was with you before...?
20	sZ1	...Ah. Yeah. Look, if he gives you any grief,\nreport it to me and I'll deal with him.
21	1	First order of business is to\ntalk to those three scouts, then.
22	sZ1	Thanks for this. And good hunting.
evt/nq/msg_nq110202t.json
0	tZ1	...What do you want?
1	1	Didn't Maxie tell you? We want to hear\nwhat you know about the monsters you\nscouted out.
2	tZ1	Tch. The target's hunting grounds are\nsouthwest of here, in Nih'l Valley.
3	1	...Anything else?
4	tZ1	Not for you. What, isn't\nknowing its location enough?
5	tZ1	Try not to die, traitors.
6	5	Oi, listen you-!
7	2	Leave it, Lanz.
8	tZ1	Hmph.
evt/nq/msg_nq110203t.json
0	uZ1	Here you are. I guess you want\nto know about the monster?
1	4	Correct. Would you be willing to\ngive us more detailed information?
2	uZ1	Your enemy's the boss of the Arachnos.\nAnd if that wasn't trouble enough, it'll\nhave brought its minions along.
3	uZ1	If you want to be certain to catch it,\nyou'll want to ambush it by Raptor Perch.
4	3	Makes sense. Raptor Perch, you said?\nWhere is that, exactly?
5	uZ1	In the middle of Dannagh\nDesert, east of here.
6	1	Got it. We'll take a look.
7	uZ1	People died even to get this\nmuch information, you know.
8	uZ1	But we have to defend the colony...
9	uZ1	So I don't say this out of duty.\nAll of our hopes go with you!
evt/nq/msg_nq110204t.json
0	vZ1	Captain's already briefed me. I'll give you\nthe info we collected on the monster.
1	1	Much appreciated.
2	vZ1	It's a Volff, but bigger than a normal one.
3	vZ1	It covers a wide territory,\nand is extremely agile.
4	vZ1	We analyzed its movements, and confirmed\nPiento Basin as the site of its lair.
5	vZ1	And that's about it.
6	1	Thanks. That's plenty of information\nfor us to be getting on with.
7	vZ1	Don't let your guard down.\nWe've already lost friends to this.
8	2	We'll take it seriously. And we'll\ndo our best to put it down.
9	vZ1	...Thank you.
evt/nq/msg_nq110205t.json
0	1	Maxie, it's done. All three\nmonsters are taken care of.
1	sZ1	What? Really?!
2	3	Here's some proof. A little bit of each\nof the monsters. Isn't nature beautiful?
3	sZ1	This is- Huh! Wow.\nUm. Yeah. Thanks.
4	2	This will result in less attacks from the\nmonsters, too. That's got to be good.
5	sZ1	We'll take it from here, then. Don't worry,\nwe won't let your work be in vain.
6	sZ1	That said... If I were to ask\none more little favor...?
7	5	Yeah, sure, whatever you want.
8	sZ1	Could you run these monster...pieces...\nup to the procurement division?
9	1	We'll pass them to\nSolon if that's OK.
10	6	The procurement division?
11	sZ1	The department in charge of managing the\ncolony's supplies. They deal with anything\nscavenged from monsters.
12	sZ1	The head of the division is called Solon.\nTell him I sent you, he'll understand.
13	1	OK, Solon, got it. We'll\nhand the goods over.
14	sZ1	Thanks again for all this.\nI can't express how grateful I am...!

0	@Z1	Much obliged, you lot!\nWhat can I do for you?
1	@Z1	Hello! Can I help you?
2	1	Maxie asked us to give you these.
3	@Z1	Let's see... Oho! Looks like\na certain operation went pretty well.
4	@Z1	Thanks so much for everything you've\ndone. I'll find a good use for these.
5	@Z1	...It was pretty out of character for Maxie\nto have entrusted you with this job.
6	2	We thought so too. Getting outsiders\ninvolved in such an important task...
7	@Z1	No, not that. I mean, on a personal level.\nMaxie used to be such a lone Volff.
8	@Z1	We're in the same cohort. And he\nused to be a real loose cannon...\nHe was really a lot to deal with.
9	3	Huh, really? Him?\nThat is a surprise.
10	@Z1	The old Maxie would have\ngone on a solo monster hunt.
11	@Z1	But somehow he became a squad\ncaptain and learned how to ask for help.\nIt's kind of a moving story, really.
12	@Z1	Oops, that certainly took a turn.\nLet's just keep this between us, OK?
13	@Z1	Hope to see you around the colony!

2	3	How're the bumps and bruises?
3	ba1	Better, mostly. Thanks for saving me.
4	4	What happened out there?\nYou mentioned a unit.
5	ba1	O-oh, well...
6	sZ1	It's fine. You can talk to them.
7	1	Maxie!
8	sZ1	Thanks for watching out for him.\nHah, seems like all I'm doing lately is\ngetting bailed out by you lot...
9	1	We just happened to be\nin the area. Pretty lucky.
10	ba1	Captain Maxie... I...
11	sZ1	Take it easy, OK?\nI'll do the talking.
12	sZ1	Fighting with Agnus has kind of\nlost its meaning since Colony 4's\nFlame Clock was broken.
13	sZ1	So we sent secret messengers out all\nover, to tell other colonies the truth.
14	2	So he's one of those messengers?
15	sZ1	Right. Part of a covert team\ndispatched by the tactician squad.
16	sZ1	If everything went well, I was hoping\nwe could establish a cooperative\nnetwork between colonies...
17	ba1	...I'm sorry, Captain.
18	ba1	The unit...is gone.
19	sZ1	...What?!
20	1	But what happened? Was it monsters?
21	ba1	No, not monsters.\nA Levnis attacked us.
22	5	From Agnus?
23	ba1	...I...I don't know.
24	3	How can you not know?
25	ba1	It just showed up out of nowhere.\nBefore we knew it, our escort was...
26	ba1	I'd never seen a\nLevnis like that before...
27	ba1	It was...monstrous...!
28	4	What do you think of all this?
29	sZ1	As soon as they hit the unit, it should've been\nclear to them we didn't have Flame Clocks,\nso there wasn't anything for them to gain...
30	sZ1	And despite that, they...annihilated them.
31	sZ1	It doesn't make sense. But if they\ndid it knowing full well what our\ngoal was...
32	4	You're saying the enemy's intention was\nto stop the information from getting\nout? To isolate Colony 4?
33	1	A Levnis that appeared out of nowhere,\nlike nothing anyone's ever seen...
34	1	No, it can't be.
35	5	What's up, Noah?
36	1	Maxie, do you know where\nthe attack took place?
37	sZ1	Well?
38	ba1	We met them at Murmur Rise.\nThey must have been lying in wait...
39	sZ1	There you have it. But you aren't\nactually going there, are you?
40	1	I'm afraid we probably are... I have a hunch\nas to who the assailants might be.
41	sZ1	...Are you serious?
42	1	I'm not sure yet. That's why\nI want to do some digging.
43	sZ1	...
44	1	But this is a Colony 4 matter,\nso you have the final say.
45	sZ1	...I'd be grateful if you would, actually.\nBut I do have a condition.
46	sZ1	I get to go with you.
47	3	No skin off our collective nose.\nBut is it a good idea for the captain\nto leave his post?
48	sZ1	No. But I'm going anyway.
49	1	...OK. Then we should set off soon.
50	ba1	Captain...
51	sZ1	We'll take care of this.\nYour job is to rest.
52	ba1	...Understood.\nLuck be with you.

2	sZ1	It's not over yet! Here it comes!
evt/nq/msg_nq110304f.json
0	sZ1	Where the spark is it?!\nThose cowards!
1	sZ1	Snuff you all! Don't jerk us\naround! Get back here!
2	sZ1	(pant pant)
3	1	Maxie...
4	sZ1	My men died because of me, through\nmy own lapse in judgment. I may\nas well have killed them myself...
5	sZ1	All the revenge in the world\nwon't change that.
6	1	Your anger is natural. You've lost friends.
7	sZ1	...
8	2	We can send your\nteam off if you want.
9	sZ1	...Could you? Please?
evt/nq/msg_nq110305f.json
0	3	Well, so much for unmasking the enemy.
1	sZ1	Yeah...\nSo, this is all just speculation, but...
2	sZ1	You going around breaking Flame Clocks\nmeans that the war between us can stop.
3	sZ1	If that knowledge gets out,\nthen we can end the war.
4	2	...And this attack is the work of\nsomeone who doesn't want that\nto happen. Is that your theory?
5	sZ1	Whether it's true or not, it looks like we\nhave to stay on guard against more\nthan Agnus and monsters now.
6	sZ1	We have to be more careful about\nwho our friends and enemies are.\nWe can't afford to be careless.
7	sZ1	We won't make the same mistake\ntwice. I promise you that.
8	1	...You OK, Maxie?
9	sZ1	Yeah, I'm fine. Everything's\nfine, thanks to you.
10	sZ1	Sorry, I'm going to get back to the colony.\nI have a lot of planning to do.
11	5	Yeah, I bet. Better get\nyourself off home.
12	sZ1	...Those Levnises were clearly after you.
13	sZ1	Don't die, OK?
evt/nq/msg_nq110400f.json
0	@Z1	Oh, phew, you made it back OK.
1	1	Bolearis gave us a heads up.
2	yZ1	We heard what happened. So Ethel's...
3	1	...
4	sZ1	...Your expression says it all.
5	sZ1	She bet her life on the fight.\nAnd...she's gone.
6	gW1	...Ngh!
7	yZ1	Oh, Ethel...
8	Xa1	She was always charging off\non her own... Spark it!
9	sZ1	OK, enough blathering. We need to\ndecide where we go from here.
10	yZ1	...Yeah, you're right.\nSo now what, Bolearis?
11	gW1	...
12	@Z1	Bolearis? Hello?
13	gW1	...Mm?
14	Xa1	No, not "mm"! We need a plan!
15	gW1	Oh, right...
16	gW1	...I'm sorry, I just, I need\nsome time to think.
17	Xa1	Excuse-? Hey, Bolearis!
18	yZ1	...He's taking it pretty\nbadly. As you'd expect.
19	sZ1	But the smoothest course is for the\nlieutenant to step up as commander.
20	sZ1	If things fall apart here then that's\ngoing to endanger Colony 4's survival.
21	Xa1	Yeah, but he's not up to\nit. Nothing we can do.
22	@Z1	...We need Ethel now more than ever.
23	1	Bolearis...
evt/nq/msg_nq110401f.json
0	gW1	...The commander would come here\noften when she needed to think.
1	gW1	She told me her favorite thing\nin the world was the view of Colony 4\nshe got from here.
2	gW1	We vowed to follow her to the ends of the\nworld. That's the kind of person she was.
3	gW1	Ethel will always be our commander.\nI can't imagine anything else.
4	1	I'm sorry, Bolearis.\nI don't know what to say.
5	gW1	...Sorry. Guess I must look\npretty pathetic to you right now.
6	gW1	Say... Do you reckon you could\ndo something for me?
7	1	Yeah, of course, anything.
8	gW1	Can you take me to where the\ncommander had her last battle?
9	1	Bolearis, that's...
10	1	...Yeah, we can take you.
evt/nq/msg_nq110402f.json
0	gW1	That's Ethel's Ferronis...!
1	3	Hold up a minute...\nWho's that lot over there?
2	5	What are those Tirkins up to?
3	6	Are they taking over the Ferronis...?
4	gW1	Wh-what?!
5	1	Bolearis, wait!
6	gW1	Get away from that Ferronis!
7	gW1	How dare you defile Commander Ethel's\nresting place! I'll tear you all to pieces!
evt/nq/msg_nq110403f.json
0	gW1	(pant pant) Learned your lesson\nnow?! You feathered menaces!
1	5	Simmer down, Bolearis!\nIf we lose you too...
2	gW1	...Just tell me one thing.
3	gW1	How did the commander die?
4	1	...She fought with everything she\nhad to settle things with Cammuravi.
5	1	Not even Moebius stealing her flame\ncould shake her will.
6	1	She was so noble... I felt like\nI was looking at the sun, she was\nso glorious.
7	gW1	...I see. Thanks\nfor telling me.
8	gW1	She fought, true to herself,\nto the bitter end...
9	gW1	Well, then I guess I have\nmy own fight to fight.
10	gW1	I have to defend her legacy...!
11	1	Let's get back to\nthe colony, Bolearis.
12	1	Everyone's waiting for you.
evt/nq/msg_nq110404f.json
0	gW1	Hey, it's me. Call the squad captains\nto the council room. It's time to resume\nthe meeting.
1	1	You've got this.
2	gW1	Will you join us? You don't have\nto do anything, just observe.
3	1	...Yeah, sure.
4	Xa1	First you run off, and then you resume the\nmeeting like nothing happened. What are\nyou playing at, Bolearis?
5	sZ1	...
6	gW1	I'm sorry, everyone. I'll\nexplain everything later.
7	gW1	But before that, there's something\nI've got to say to you.
8	@Z1	Then you'd better\ncome out and say it.
9	gW1	OK, then, listen up!\nI, Bolearis, hereby...
10	gW1	...resign my seat as lieutenant, and\ntake on the role of acting commander.
11	sZ1	...What?
12	Xa1	What?! You can't just-!\n...Wait a second. What did you say?
13	yZ1	What do you mean, "acting"...?
14	gW1	Maybe I can explain if you'll shut up\nfor a minute. Look, I'm not cut out to\nbe commander.
15	@Z1	You said it, not us...
16	gW1	She's the only commander we'll\never have. I know you probably\nthink so. And spark it, I agree.
17	gW1	But Colony 4 won't last\nmuch longer like this.
18	gW1	We cannot lose the colony\nCommander Ethel left in our hands.
19	gW1	So I'm stepping up in her\nplace to lead this colony!
20	yZ1	We certainly need someone who\ncan command us all, but...
21	Xa1	And what's with this "acting" idiocy?\nIt's not the magnificent announcement you\nseem to think it is. You're joking, right?
22	gW1	Sorry, Dinzel, but I'm deadly serious.\nI know some think I'm not suited to the\nrole, but I can't hand it over to anyone.
23	sZ1	...I don't see a problem with it.
24	@Z1	I didn't think you'd be\non board with this, Maxie.
25	sZ1	Ethel had an energy that we lack.
26	sZ1	And that energy is what let us\nget to Silver in three terms.
27	sZ1	I can feel something similar\nfrom Bolearis now.
28	sZ1	I think it's a good direction to go in.
29	Xa1	Looks like our maverick loose\ncannon has mellowed out.
30	sZ1	I learned that you have to change if you're\ngoing to survive. You have to learn to\naccept anything.
31	@Z1	We need to bring our colony back to the top.\nThat's what you're saying, isn't it, Maxie?
32	Xa1	...Well, I suppose this way is better\nthan some interminable yawnfest to\ndecide her successor.
33	yZ1	Decisiveness was always one of\nEthel's...Colony 4's...precepts.
34	Xa1	Well, now that you've declared\nyourself, I hope you'll be up for the job,\nActing Commander.
35	gW1	You mean...?
36	@Z1	Now that we're all agreed,\nyou'd better start ordering us\naround, Acting Commander.
37	gW1	Yeah... Yeah! I'll take care of everything.
evt/nq/msg_nq110500s.json
0	1	The mood in Colony 4 seems to be\na lot livelier than before, somehow.
1	4	I agree. It's likely because they can access\nthe food and resources they need, now.
2	2	I'm so glad they seem to\nhave weathered the storm.
3	5	Speaking of food, Colony 4 took down\nthat whopper of an Armu, right?
4	3	Wow... I bet they got a lot\nof meat outta that thing.
5	3	I've heard they got some amazing cuts\nfrom it, like first-rate fillets. Bet they've\nbeen stuffing themselves with 'em all day.
6	6	"First-rate fillets"...!
7	5	That makes me drool so much\nI'm about to get dehydrated.\nWhen do I get to eat some, huh?!
8	6	R-right? ...Think they'd let\nus have a little nibble...?
9	4	I don't know... They might think it a bit\npresumptuous of us if we come asking.
10	3	OK, well, but look here!\nSurely we've helped them enough to earn\nat least a few bites... Right?
11	5	Oh, great... All this talk of meat and\nnow it's the only thing I wanna eat!
12	3	Samesies!
13	6	Me too!
14	4	Good grief, you people...
evt/nq/msg_nq110501f.json
0	xZ1	Oh, hey, you lot! You came\nat just the right time.
1	xZ1	We got our hands on some high-quality\nmeat recently. Care to try some?
2	3	Oh! You mean from that huge Armu\nyou hunted, yeah?!
3	xZ1	Eh? How did you know that...? Is that\nwhy you came here in the first place?
4	5	Well, uh, we just heard you had\nsome "first-rate fillets"...and then we\ncouldn't stop thinking about 'em... So...
5	xZ1	Pfft... Hahaha! So it is why you schlepped\nyourselves all this way! Didn't expect you\nto have such a base motivation, gotta say!
6	2	O-our apologies. If we've offended,\nwe'll just go...?
7	xZ1	Nah, it's fine. We already decided\nwe'd treat you as thanks for your help.
8	xZ1	So yeah, grab some seats and\nI'll bring it right out for you.
9	xZ1	I've got plenty of that first-rate fillet\nyou want so much, and it's got your\nnames on it!
10	5	Whew, I'm stuffed! Don't think I've had\nsuch tasty meat in all my life!
11	6	Oh yeah, me too. I'm almost tearing up\nover how good it was...
12	3	It definitely earned that "first-rate" part.\nIt melted on my tongue, like some kinda\nhuge, juicy, meaty snowflake!
13	4	Indeed. I won't be forgetting\nthis any time soon.
14	xZ1	Hahaha! What great feedback. Glad to\nsee my hard work didn't go to waste.
15	1	That was super delicious.\nThank you so much for...every...thing...
16	xZ1	Hm? Something wrong?
17	2	I... Wh-what...? M-my body feels...numb...
18	xZ1	H-hey! What's going on?! Stay with me!!!
19	xZ1	S-somebody, come quick!\nI need the med team here, stat...!
20	1	...Ugh... Is everyone all right?
21	2	I-I don't feel right at all...\nMy body feels...wrung out...
22	3	Urgh... I feel like I'm gonna puke...\nWhat the spark happened...?
23	4	It seems we were transported to the medic\nteam after losing consciousness...
24	1	Let's ask Oleshandra what happened...\nShe might know something.
evt/nq/msg_nq110502t.json
0	yZ1	Ah, what a relief. Looks like you're\nback on your feet. How do you feel?
1	1	My head still feels fuzzy... Any clue\nwhat happened to us back there?
2	yZ1	Actually, about that... I'll tell you,\nbut please try not to freak out.
3	yZ1	To be truthful, we... We found traces\nof poison in the food you ate earlier.
4	2	Poison...?!
5	yZ1	Relax, please. It won't have any\nlasting effects, thanks to how\nquickly you received treatment.
6	5	So does that mean...that Laszlo guy\nput poison in our dinner?!
7	yZ1	...He's actually being questioned\nby Bolearis in Command right now.
8	6	We should go there too. What he did was\nawful, no matter how you slice it!
9	3	Yeah! There's no gray area to this.\nWe can't let this slide!
10	2	Hm...
evt/nq/msg_nq110503f.json
0	xZ1	Ah...! There you all are!\nI'm so happy you're still breathing!
1	gW1	...I heard what happened. Sorry to hear\nyou got involved in this kinda mess.
2	1	Ah, yeah... That's what we\ncame here to talk about.
3	xZ1	Right... I see. I suppose you must\nthink I'm the culprit. It's so obvious,\nanyone would.
4	xZ1	But...I didn't do it. I swear!\nYou have to believe me...!
5	gW1	Or so he claims. But who else\ncould've done it, if not him?
6	2	...Can you wait a bit before you\ndecide to punish him, Bolearis?
7	gW1	...Why do you ask that?
8	2	If he didn't do it, as he says, then the real\nculprit must be out there somewhere... No?
9	gW1	Yeah, I suppose... Are you saying\nyou're gonna try and catch them?
10	xZ1	Ah...!
11	gW1	I should point out though, this isn't your\nresponsibili- Ah, know what, never mind.\nI'll stop being an idiot now.
12	gW1	All right, then. I'll leave the investigation\nin your capable hands, while *I* keep an\neye on Laszlo here.
13	xZ1	I-I'm sorry...\nI hate to put you out like this...
14	2	Don't worry. We'll try and\nstraighten this all out.
15	3	Lovely sentiment, Mio, love, but how\nexactly do you propose we do that?
16	1	We should gather info, at the very least.\nLet's check out any places we think\ncould be somewhat relevant.
17	2	Yes, exactly. Let's look for clues,\nno matter how trivial they may seem.
evt/nq/msg_nq110504s.json
0	2	Let's summarize all the information\nwe've gathered so far, then.
1	2	First of all, the poison used in\nthe attack is a medicine purloined\nfrom the medic team.
2	1	We also know there's a high chance that\nthe poison was put in during cooking.
3	3	So that soldier from another unit must have\nslipped into the kitchen and done it then.
4	5	If Laszlo really isn't the baddie,\nthen that person'd be mega suspicious.
5	6	But we still have no idea who\nthat could even be...
6	2	...Let's go over the facts\ncarefully, one more time.
7	2	The people who could access the poison\nare the medical team and tactician squad.
8	1	And then there was a soldier in the\nkitchen with a "bad nature",\naccording to Kukucha.
9	4	Are there any bad-natured soldiers in\nthe medical or tactician squads...?
10	6	...Oh, sparks!!!
11	2	Wh-what's wrong, Sena?!
12	6	Mimi! I know! I know who the culprit is!
13	2	What...?!
14	6	It has to be him! I don't know about\nthe medical team, but in the tactician\nsquad, there's one bad-natured soldier-
15	5	Oh...! I know who you mean!\nIt must be that guy, yeah!
16		The true culprit is...
17		Maxie, from the tactician squad.
18	3	Yes, he's in the tactician squad,\nbut would you really say he's got\na bad attitude?
19	2	I actually thought he's a\npretty decent bloke...
20		Laszlo, from the culinary team.
21	4	Isn't he the one we've been trying to avoid\nblaming? Does this mean you're giving up?
22		One of us!!!
23	2	Uh...
24	1	Lanz... Now is not the time for jokes.
25	5	M-my bad! Just thought I'd ease\nthe tension a little...
26	3	You're so clueless sometimes, you spoon.
27		Jeremy, from the tactician squad.
28	2	Oh, him...!
29	4	...I remember him. He's that soldier who\nrandomly started butting heads with us.
30	3	He could get his hands on the poison, and\nwe all know he has a "bad nature"...
31	6	He also told Mio to watch out for poison\nbefore. It sounded kinda like a threat!
32	6	That has to be our guy! No doubt about it!
33	2	Wait a minute, Sena.\nWe still don't know for sure...
34	4	He was openly hostile to us,\nso there's a clear motive there.
35	5	Crap! He won't get away with this!\nJust wait till I find that mudder-
36	2	I said, wait!
37	1	M-Mio...?
38	2	...Calm down, everybody. Let's talk to\nLaszlo one more time, first.
39	2	I'm sure he's been anxiously waiting\nto hear what we have to say.
40	5	Y-yeah, you're right.
41	2	Mm...
42	6	You OK, Mimi...?
evt/nq/msg_nq110505f.json
0	xZ1	There you all are... Well?\nDid you catch the culprit?
1	2	Before we go about that, we need to ask...\nDo you know Jeremy, the tactician?
2	xZ1	O-oh, yeah... Of course.\nWe're in the same term...
3	xZ1	...Wait! Are you telling me\n*he's* the culprit?
4	4	We're not certain yet, but there's\na high possibility it's him, yes.
5	xZ1	No way...
6	xZ1	...I mean, yes way. He's certainly\ncapable of such a thing.
7	1	Indeed... He didn't seem\ntoo keen on us before.
8	xZ1	Heh, you're not the only ones. I have\nthe feeling he's not too fond of me either...
9	gW1	Ah...
10	xZ1	...I actually used to belong to the tactician\nsquad, but got injured in battle and\ntransferred to the kitchens.
11	xZ1	Back then, my two teammates were\nJeremy...and my dear friend Mercutio.
12	2	Wait...! Is that the soldier who\nfought against Colony Psi and...?
13	xZ1	Jeremy probably hates me just as much as\nthe Agnians who killed our friend, just\nfor taking you guys in.
14	4	So that's why he tried to pin the blame\non you after trying to poison us?
15	5	All right, we get the picture. We can\nhear the rest after we catch him!
16	xZ1	Wait, hold on! Please\nlet me come with you!
17	2	Uh, weren't you under arrest...?
18	gW1	...It's OK, you can go.\nI'll take responsibility,\njust sort this mess out.
19	xZ1	Acting Commander... Thank you so much!
20	1	In that case, we just need\nto find out where he is...
21	xZ1	It's probably quicker to ask Captain Maxie\nwhere he is, since he's Jeremy's superior.
22	4	Good thinking. Let's hurry up\nand catch this miscreant.
evt/nq/msg_nq110506f.json
0	xZ1	Hey, Captain Maxie. Do you\nknow where Jeremy is?
1	sZ1	Oh, hello, Laszlo. I thought I heard\nBolearis took you into custody...?
2	3	We'll explain the details later. Can you\nplease tell us where Jeremy is first?
3	sZ1	He's on patrol duty with Yorde...\nIt seemed quite urgent.
4	sZ1	Fla'ran!
5	sZ1	Take this lot down Route 3C and\nconvene with Jeremy's patrol, posthaste.
6	uZ1	Got it!
7	uZ1	They should be near the Dannagh Desert.\nIt's a bit of a trek, so bear with.
evt/nq/msg_nq110507f.json
0	uZ1	What's going on...?! Yorde!
1	uZ1	What's wrong? What happened?\nAnd where's that snuffin' Jeremy?
2	vZ1	Agh... Jeremy, he... When he saw you\napproaching, he suddenly spiraled\ninto a complete panic...
3	vZ1	Then he whacked me on the head,\nprobably trying to knock me out... Ugh...
4	uZ1	That arsehole...! How could he do this to\nhis own patrol-mate? He won't get away\nwith this!
5	xZ1	Take it easy, Fla'ran. You just take\ncare of Yorde's wounds for now.
6	2	We'll go chase after Jeremy.\nSomeone needs to look after her.
7	uZ1	Now look here-!
8	uZ1	...All right, understood. Just be sure to\ngive him a whack upside the chin for me,\nyou hear?
9	1	Let's go follow him, while we can still\nsee his footprints. Come on, hurry!
evt/nq/msg_nq110508f.json
0	xZ1	Jeremy!
1	tZ1	Gh...
2	5	Hey, you haven't been on the front lines\nin a while, have you? Just hang back.
3	xZ1	Huh...? Are you trying to help him?
4	2	Yes. We'll deal with this.
5	xZ1	...All right. I'll stay out of your way!
evt/nq/msg_nq110509f.json
0	xZ1	...Jeremy. You put the poison\nin their food, didn't you?
1	tZ1	Hah... So you figured it out? If you're\ngonna kill me, just hurry up and do it.
2	xZ1	Stop talking nonsense! You know\nMercutio wouldn't have wanted this!
3	tZ1	What the snuff do you know about him?!\nYou just ran away from the fight, coward!\nYou don't get a say!
4	xZ1	Rgh...!
5	tZ1	You're a traitor to your friends,\nsetting the past aside like that!
6	tZ1	Like you've plain forgotten about Mercutio!\nHe'd be ashamed of you, kissing up to the\nenemy like that!
7	xZ1	Y-you're wrong about me! All I did was-!
8	2	Whatever you might think,\nnone of that is an excuse to\nlash out against your comrades.
9	tZ1	I'm not listening to a word\na snuffin' *Agnian* has to say!
10	6	Mimi!
11	2	I wasn't joking when I said you can\nshoot me if you want to.
12	tZ1	Shut up! I don't wanna hear any more!!!
13	2	But... Looking at you now, I'm\npretty sure you won't shoot.
14	tZ1	Shut your trap!!!
15	tZ1	If you want me to kill you that badly, I'll\nmake sure I finish the job this time!
16	2	...
17	tZ1	...Ngh!
18	tZ1	Crap...! Snuff it all!!!
19	tZ1	Why...?! How did it come to this?!
20	tZ1	What did I do wrong?!\nAre you saying *I'm* the traitor?!
21	tZ1	My friend was *killed*!\nI can never forget that!
22	tZ1	Why can't I shoot...?!\nOh, snuff it...!!!
23	2	Mm...
24	xZ1	I'll take Jeremy back to the colony.\nIt's OK if I take over from here, right?
25	2	...I'm sorry, Laszlo.
26	xZ1	It's not your fault...\nActually, it's nobody's fault.
27	xZ1	It's the war's fault. But at some point,\nsomebody's going to have to put an end\nto all that, hopefully.
28	xZ1	I'm talking about you, Ouroboros.\nI'm sure he gets that, too.
29	2	(sigh)...
30	xZ1	It's not my place to ask you this...but will\nyou please come back to check in on us?
31	2	Yes... Of course.
evt/nq/msg_nq110510t.json
0	wZ1	Why, Kukucha have never ever\nmet someone so rude!
1	wZ1	Hey, hey, you friends! Let Kukucha\nbend your ear a minute!
2	3	What's up? Something wrong?
3	wZ1	Kukucha saw soldier in kitchen earlier,\nsneaking around, all creepy-like!
4	wZ1	So Kukucha say, please not to\ngo in there, super-duper politely.
5	wZ1	Then he say to Kukucha, "SHUT UP",\nand shove me, and run off, like ZOOM!
6	wZ1	Then Kukucha fell flat on bottom.\nIt still sting now!
7	6	I-I see... That sounds rough.
8	wZ1	That person had such bad nature!\nKukucha is squad leader, surely\nhave earned some respect!
9	wZ1	Kukucha is sure they come to pilfer\nfirst-rate fillets of Laszlo.\nWhat greedy manners!
10	2	Oh...! So he went in the kitchen\nwhile Laszlo was cooking?
11	wZ1	That is right, that is right!\nIs that relevant for something?
12	4	Did you catch a glimpse of his face?
13	wZ1	Of course! But me forgot it\nabout three ticks later.
14	3	...I don't know who this guy was, but\nhe sounds mega suspicious to me.
15	4	A rude soldier in the kitchen... Let's keep\nthat in the back of our minds for now.
evt/nq/msg_nq110511t.json
0	@Z1	I heard what happened at the canteen.\nThat can't have been fun...
1	1	We're looking for clues right now. Could\nyou tell us if you know anything?
2	@Z1	Yes, of course. I'll tell you\neverything I know.
3	@Z1	First of all, the meat you all ate came\nfrom a giant Armu that the tactician\nsquad procured.
4	@Z1	Usually, that kind of catch is examined\nby us before we hand it over to\nKukucha in the culinary team.
5	@Z1	There was no funny business like\nputting poison in the Armu meat\nwhen we were looking at it.
6	6	So you mean...the meat was\nfirst-rate when you saw it? Eh? Eh?
7	3	Sena, keep it in your pocket.
8	@Z1	This is just guesswork from me, but I think\nthe meat was probably poisoned after\nwe handed it to the kitchen.
9	4	So you're saying that it's more likely the\npoison was added in the cooking stage.
10	@Z1	That's what I think, anyway.\nIt's purely conjecture, though.
11	3	So maybe it really was Laszlo...
12	2	Hey, we still don't know that for sure.\nThere might be some other clues around...
evt/nq/msg_nq110512t.json
0	yZ1	Hello, there...
1	2	Hey, Oleshandra. We wanted to\nask you about the poison.
2	yZ1	...Before you do, let me take\nthis opportunity to apologize.
3	3	Apologize? What for?
4	yZ1	The neurotoxin you were given...\ncame from the medical team's stores.
5	1	Really...?!
6	yZ1	Well, it's not meant as a toxin really. It's\nsupposed to be a pain-relieving medication.\nBut if you overdose, then, well...
7	4	Can you guess who it could've been that\ntook the substance from your stores?
8	yZ1	...Well, it goes without saying that the\nmedic team and I can access it...
9	yZ1	The only other people I can think of\nare the soldiers in the tactician squad.
10	yZ1	They often take some of it on missions\nto use on any wounded soldiers.
11	yZ1	I've warned them about it many times, but\nI can never be too strict with them. They\n*are* putting their lives on the line for us...
12	4	So the poison came from the medic team...\nIt really was an inside job by a member of\nColony 4.
evt/nq/msg_nq110513t.json
0	yZ1	Bolearis is questioning Laszlo\nin Command right now.
evt/nq/msg_nq110514t.json
0	xZ1	I'm sorry about this mess...\nAnd thank you for believing in me.
evt/nq/msg_nq110515t.json
0	gW1	Hmmm... Seems that Colony 4\nis still quite divided.
evt/nq/msg_nq110516t.json
0	gW1	Laszlo still isn't back to fighting form\nafter the injuries he sustained, before.
1	gW1	I'm sorry for all the bother we've caused\nyou. I'm leaving this in your hands.
evt/nq/msg_nq110517t.json
0	sZ1	Shouldn't you be hurrying?\nFla'ran can show you the way.
evt/nq/msg_nq110518t.json
0	vZ1	I'm... I'm fine... Just go after Jeremy...!
evt/nq/msg_nq110519t.json
0	uZ1	That arsehole Jeremy...! I'm gonna\nsock him one next time I see him!
evt/nq/msg_nq110600s.json
0	3	I'm probably just imagining it, but...
1	3	Does Colony 4 not feel a bit...tense to you?
2	2	I noticed that too. Maybe\nsomething happened.
3	4	I've heard that procurement of\nsupplies isn't going too well.
4	4	Not having what they need when they\nneed seems to be an ever-present problem.
5	5	Ah, yeah, that would explain\nwhy they're so moody.
6	6	And who's in charge of that stuff again?
7	2	The procurement division. We\nmet its leader, Solon, remember?
8	1	Solon was a big help to us before.\nLet's talk to him when we're in the vicinity.
9	3	A department called the procurement\ndivision, according to the soldiers\nwho were whinging about it.
10	1	If we're ever in the area, why not pay\na visit to this procurement division?
evt/nq/msg_nq110601t.json
0	@Z1	Hello, there! Anything I can do for you?
1	5	Heard the procurement division's\nhaving problems. You lot gonna be OK?
2	@Z1	...Oh, you heard that, did you?
3	@Z1	Well, to be completely honest,\nI wouldn't say "OK" is the word I'd use.
4	@Z1	We've been swamped with requests\nfor supplies from every team, and\nwe've hardly been able to keep up.
5	3	Queen's beans, it's that bad?
6	@Z1	There's always some kind of trouble, so\nwith all these shortages things are getting\ndesperate.
7	4	As resources are so limited, it must be\nimpossible to fulfill the teams' demands.
8	@Z1	Exactly. And if we so much as make a\nmistake in the distribution, everyone's\nat each other's throats in a second.
9	1	This is worse than I expected.\nIs there anything we can do to help?
10	@Z1	...There is one favor you could do,\nif you'd be so kind.
11	@Z1	One of my subordinates is a Nopon\ncalled Mikoko, taking care of materials\nfor the cooks.
12	@Z1	And Brunella is looking out for the medic\nteam. Could you help them out?
13	1	Yeah, of course.\nMikoko and Brunella, right?
14	@Z1	It doesn't matter who you\nhelp first. Just, thank you.
evt/nq/msg_nq110602f.json
0	Wa1	What problem? Mikoko is busyful\nwith craps! Scram and go bye-bye!
1	3	Well, Mikoko, you're a Nopon after my\nown heart. Solon sent us to help you out.
2	Wa1	Then you not dillydally and say so\nin first place! Down to tacks of brass.
3	wZ1	Mikoko, is ingredients\nnot ready yet?
4	Wa1	You back again! Stubborn like\nRhinon! When Mikoko say no\ningredient left, is no ingredient!
5	wZ1	But everyone tummy grumbly-rumbly!\nIs very annoying to listen to!
6	Wa1	Annoyed one is Mikoko! Go away!
7	wZ1	OK, then Kukucha waiting patiently!\nPlease be quickety quick!
8	Wa1	Everyone unreasonable, only think\nof selfs! What Mikoko do when no\ningredient to be had?!
9	6	That sounds rough...
10	Wa1	Stock need to be refilled!
11	Wa1	You! If you so eager for helping\nthen source ingredients!
12	5	Anything can be an ingredient\nif you try hard enough.\nCould you give us a hint?
13	Wa1	Fruits! Vegetable! Meats!\nAnything you find is fine!
14	Wa1	Bring and bring until stores are full!

1	_Z1	I know, I'm sorry! I'll get it\nfor you as soon as I can, I-
2	yZ1	Ugh, that's what you said last time.
3	yZ1	It's not that I think you're\nshirking your duties or anything...
4	yZ1	But if the worst happens to our patients,\nthe procurement division will bear part of\nthe responsibility, mark my words.
5	_Z1	I get it...
6	yZ1	You'd better have it ready for us\nthis time, or I swear...
7	_Z1	Yeah, you can threaten me till you're blue\nin the face, but I can't perform miracles...
8	1	...Are you Brunella? Sorry to bother you\nwhile you're in the middle of something.
9	_Z1	...What's this about?
10	2	We're here on Solon's\nbehalf to give you a hand.
11	_Z1	Oh goodness, really?! Thank you\nso much, Solon! Perfect timing!
12	_Z1	In that case, sorry to go straight\nto business, but could you harvest\nsome medicinal herbs and flowers?
13	4	Do you have anything specific in mind?
14	_Z1	Oh, just anything you find\nthat grows around here!

8	Wa1	Oho?! Please not to hesitate when\nneeding more stockup! Mikoko will\nhandle meat with handling of priority!
9	wZ1	Kukucha delighted to hear!\nCan always count on Mikoko!

4	_Z1	...Really sorry about this,\nbut could you do one\nmore thing for me?
5	_Z1	Would you come with\nme to the medic team?
6	3	Yeah. Why?

evt/nq/msg_nq110612t.json
0	yZ1	A lot of my team members seem to see\nme as a cold, scary, grumbly person...
1	yZ1	Maybe I should take a look at how\nthe other squad leaders do it...
evt/nq/msg_nq110700f.json
0	1	Isn't that...an Agnian Levnis? What's\nthat doing in a place like this...?
1	2	That's not a safe thing to have in a\nKeves colony, even if it doesn't seem\nto be working any more.
2	Ya1	Hah hah hah! No fear! I got permission\nfrom Bolearis, all proper-like!
3	Ya1	So, then!\nHave you all worked it out yet?!
4	5	Sorry, but can we pause for\na second? Who even are you?
5	Ya1	Oh, what a social blunder! I'm Ymeer, from\nthe maintenance and development team.
6	Ya1	Now that's out of the way, where was I?
7	3	This guy barely even stops for breath...
8	Ya1	What I wanted to say concerns the\nAgnian Levnis over here!
9	Ya1	Here's my question... What do you think\nmakes the difference between Kevesi and\nAgnian Levnises?!
10	6	U-um... They have different color schemes?
11	Ya1	Correct! But also incorrect!
12	5	Pick one, mate!
13	Ya1	The right answer is...their legs!
14	3	"Legs"? I didn't know\nthere was any difference.
15	Ya1	You see, Agnian Levnises come with a\nhover assembly as a standard feature.\nIn other words, they can float!
16	1	...Hm. Yes, that's true,\nnow that you mention it.
17	Ya1	Now, this goes without saying, but the\nweight of a Levnis airframe is considerable!
18	Ya1	Additionally, they have to carry heavy\narmaments, therefore you'd think it's\ncrucial that they're built with sturdy legs!
19	Ya1	However! Not so with the Agnian ones!\nThey don't even *have* legs! And when\nthey do, they're terribly spindly!
20	3	Aren't you just saying that Agnian\nLevnises are functionally better?
21	Ya1	Heheh! Though I loathe to admit it, the\nKevesi Levnises truly play second fiddle\nto the Agnian ones in this one regard!
22	Ya1	That's why I made a request to the\ntactician squad that we seize some\nproper Agnian Levnises.
23	4	...I see. So you're basically using this\nLevnis as a subject for your research.
24	Ya1	Exactly! But! The seizure operation was\nrather violent! So a lot of parts got\ndamaged and now it's almost junk!
25	Ya1	So my dream of unraveling the mysterious\nAgnian technology is still miles away!
26	Ya1	So I thought I would ask you! Please help\nmy dream become reality! I would greatly\nappreciate your cooperation!
27	5	Why are you asking us? We're not\nengineers or anythin'. What good\nwould we do?
28	Ya1	No fear, it's rather simple, actually!\nLong story short, I need more Agnian\nLevnis materials to run tests on!
29	Ya1	You don't even need to try and catch one.\nJust defeat Levnises and bring me back\nthe parts! Pretty please?
30	2	By "parts", you mean...literally anything?
31	Ya1	Yes! I will inspect the parts myself!\nAll you have to do is destroy the Levnises\nwith wild abandon and nab me the pieces!
32	Ya1	Oh! I'm sure I don't need to tell you this,\nbut I only have need of *Agnian* parts!\nPlease don't forget!
33	1	Y-yes, we gathered that already.\nWe'll bring some back for you.
evt/nq/msg_nq110701f.json
0	Ya1	Wow! Great job, I'm impressed!\nThis is more than enough samples\nfor me to carry out my analysis!
1	Ya1	Let me get straight to it!
2	Ya1	Oh my... Of course!\nSo that's what it was!!!
3	5	Wha-? Do we have a breakthrough?
4	Ya1	Yes! Good news! Thanks to all\nthe parts you brought me, I have\narrived at a highly accurate hypothesis!
5	4	Care to share?
6	Ya1	Yes! To put it simply...
7	Ya1	When concentrated energy obtained from\nether is made to circulate the gaps in the\nairframe's support structure, it disperses...
8	Ya1	...creating a field which powers the lifters\nand balancers and gives the Levnis the\nlift to support its weight and-
9	3	Ah, yeah, cool, I see, we get it.\nThat'll do now.
10	6	If you understand the mechanism now,\ndo you think you could get Kevesi\nLevnises to levitate as well?
11	Ya1	Theoretically, yes! Given access to\ninfinite time and resources, that is!
12	4	...Naturally.
13	Ya1	So! I think I will try and restore this Levnis\nas a way to test my hypothesis!
14	Ya1	If I can get it up and running again, it\nwill prove my hypothesis correct!
15	Ya1	Right, then! I can't carry on like this!\nI need to make an official request to Dinzel\nto use some developmental resources!
16	Ya1	Things are going to get much busier\naround here! Ahhh, I'm so excited!!!
evt/nq/msg_nq110702t.json
0	Ya1	You've kept me waiting! How's progress?!
1	Ya1	I'd prefer quality over quantity\nwhen you're picking up these parts!
2	Ya1	Good-quality samples will speed up\nmy inspections, after all! Now, then,\ngo out there! I'm counting on you!!!
evt/nq/msg_nq110800f.json
0	Ya1	Oh... It's you lot... Good day, everyone...
1	5	'Sup. Looks like you fixed it up good and\nproper... Are you OK, though?
2	2	Maybe I'm just imagining things, but you\nseem a lot less peppy than before...
3	Ya1	Yeah... I haven't slept a wink since I last\nsaw you... Maybe that's why...
4	1	Have you really been working\nnights just to fix this thing?
5	Ya1	Yep... I figured out how the levitational\nmechanism works, but now we've got\na new big problem on our hands...
6	4	And what would that be?
7	Ya1	Well you see, the Levnis requires a\ncolossal amount of energy to hover.
8	Ya1	So...we'd need to get our hands on a\ngargantuan number of ether cylinders!\nThere's no way we could afford it...!
9	Ya1	Without surpassing this problem, my\nhypothesis is just an armchair theory!\nAn unactualized fantasy, so to speak!
10	1	I-I'm not fully following, but I assume\nyou mean you've reached a dead end?
11	Ya1	Mm-hmmmm... Dinzel is going\nto have my head at this rate...
12	Ya1	I used up resources like they grow on\ntrees, so if I don't get a result, I'll have to\noffer up my life as penance...!
13	5	Now that's a bit dramatic...
14	Ya1	You don't know how scary he\ncan get! It could happen!
15	6	I-is there nothing else we can do?\nLike get more parts for another study...?
16	Ya1	Unfortunately, the power supply\nshort-circuits the moment the Levnis\nis destroyed, so there'd be no point-
17	Ya1	...Oh! Wait... With that kind of\nairframe, then...perhaps...!
18	Ya1	Wait...! Oh, oh...!!!\nIt's coming to me! Yes!!!
19	3	This fella's as hectic as ever...\nHaving a lightbulb moment or something?
20	Ya1	Yes, I am! There's just one thing\nwe have to do...and I'll need\nyour help again...!
21	5	Gotcha. If we can do it, we'll do it.
22	Ya1	I hoped you'd say that! Don't worry,\nit's not a difficult task! It's the\nsame thing you did before!
23	6	You want us to find more\nLevnis parts for you?
24	Ya1	Basically, yes! But this time,\nit'll have to be a Levnis called the\n"Mechapod Carthegia"!
25	Ya1	It's a highly sophisticated Levnis with a\nperfect safety mechanism around its power\nsystem. I bet you could acquire the part...
26	Ya1	...without it getting damaged in the process!\nIt'll be a tough opponent, but I believe you\nwould be able to stand a chance...!
27	1	Mechapod Carthegia, huh...\nWhere is it, then?
28	Ya1	To the best of my knowledge, I think\nit's been sighted at Lavi Sandbar!
29	3	Well, we'll do what we can, but don't\nblame me if the part does end up getting\na bit banged up, OK?
30	Ya1	Oh, don't worry! If that happens,\nI'll let Dinzel kill me to make up for it!
31	6	...That's a lot of responsibility to bear.\nNo pressure, eh?
evt/nq/msg_nq110801f.json
0	4	Here, the part from the Levnis you\npointed us to. Is it what you needed?
1	Ya1	Oh, my...! This is stupendous!\nI can't see a single scratch on it!\nIt's like it's brand new...!
2	1	Do you think this will solve your problem?
3	Ya1	Yes! All I have to do is put my theory into\npractice! Let me quickly combine the\ncomponents and attach them to the Levnis!
4	5	Whoa! It moved!\nDoes that mean it worked?
5	Ya1	Yes! No doubt about it! This is the best\nresult we could've wished for!
6	Ya1	Let me compose myself... To be honest,\nI was half-doubting my theory before...\nBut I can't doubt what I just saw...!
7	Ya1	Everyone, listen! I've been relying too\nmuch on established concepts! There's\nbeen a terrible oversight on my part!
8	2	What oversight?
9	Ya1	Before, I'd guessed that the technology\nwas essentially located in the Agnian\nLevnises' levitational mechanism!
10	Ya1	But when I opened it up, what did I find,\nyou may ask? That it's actually super\nefficient at energy conduction!!!
11	6	Energy...con-duck-shawn...?
12	4	Ah, yes... I read about the\nunderlying theory in a report\nabout Levnises once.
13	4	The process for converting the energy\nfrom an ether cylinder always results\nin a "loss" of energy... I think it said that.
14	Ya1	That's exactly right! HOWEVER!\nAgnian Levnises in particular have barely\nany loss of energy during that process!
15	1	...Sorry, Ymeer. Can you simplify\nthat a bit for us amateurs?
16	Ya1	Errr... Roughly speaking, it means that\nit can operate at full power without\nwasting as much energy as before!
17	5	Hmmm, I see. But, uh...is that\nreally such a big deal?
18	Ya1	Of course it is! For instance, our Ferronis\nhas been out of order until now...
19	Ya1	Without a Flame Clock, ether cylinders\ndon't output sufficient energy, making it\nutterly impossible to operate our Ferronis!
20	Ya1	However! With this technology, we can\ncreate a power system to rival the Flame\nClock by our own means!
21	Ya1	And with that system...we can get\nthe Ferronis up and running once more!
22	5	Whoa...! Are you serious?
23	Ya1	Deadly! ...Well, theoretically, of course!\nDepending on time, resources and available\nmanpower, too!
24	2	...In other words, it's going to take a while.
25	Ya1	I am so grateful to you all! Thanks to you,\nmy results far exceeded my expectations!
26	Ya1	With this outcome alone, I'm pretty much\nguaranteed to be the next captain!
27	Ya1	A captain can allocate endless resources!\nMy research will bring advances the likes\nof which have never been seen before!
28	3	You're starting to worry me, matey...\nAh, well, whatever. Fill your boots!
29	Ya1	Thanks for your support! I appreciate\nit so much! I'll do my very best!
30	Ya1	If the Ferronis starts working again,\nthe first thing I'll do is help you out!
31	Ya1	When that time comes, just remember\nwhat a bloody genius I was!!!

3	1	Putting aside job satisfaction for a moment,\nnobody seems to know where this Nopon's\ngone. That's worrying.
4	2	I hope they're not in trouble.
5	3	Let me guess. Now we go to the\nmaintenance and development team\nand ask around.
6	6	Good idea! The team's headed by\nDinzel. Seems like a good place to start.
evt/nq/msg_nq110901t.json
0	6	So, we heard about the\nNopon who went missing.
1	Xa1	Oh? You know about Bambam?
2	Xa1	Ugh, that fuzzy-headed\nidiot hasn't been back.
3	2	That doesn't sound good...
4	Xa1	That fluffball knows how busy we are\nwith the Levnis inspections and still\ndecided to go wandering off!
5	1	And you have no idea where?
6	Xa1	Maybe Dorin would know,\nbut who knows where he is?!
7	2	Who's Dorin?
8	Xa1	One of Bambam's friends.\nNothing but trouble, that brat.
9	Xa1	...You get the picture. If you find Dorin\nthen pass on a message for me.
10	Xa1	"Stop slacking off work and bring\nBambam back with you or you'll\nget a clip round the ear."
evt/nq/msg_nq110902t.json
0	1	Are you Dorin?
1	Za1	Wha? Oh, yeah, that's\nme. Need something?
2	2	Dinzel has a message for you...
3	Za1	Oh, right, the one about the clip\nround the ear? No need to pay that\nany mind, he's always that way.
4	1	Is Bambam not with you?
5	Za1	Don't tell me Bambam's\ngone AWOL again.
6	6	What do you mean, "again"?
7	Za1	It's something of a regular\noccurrence. He's quick to bunk off.\nWell, not like I can talk.
8	Za1	He's so open about it, though. I'm always\ntelling him to be smarter about it.
9	4	...Perhaps we've found the reason why\nyour boss is always so angry.
10	Za1	You're odd ducks, aren't you?\nAll this worry about a Nopon\nyou've never met.
11	3	Yeah, but don't you want to make sure he\nain't in trouble or anything? Little fella\nmight've fallen off a cliff. Think about it.
12	Za1	Gah... Yeah, you're right.\nAnd I'm his senior, guess I\nshould be looking out for him.
13	1	Do you know where Bambam might go\nto hide from work? Even a guess?
14	Za1	My guess would be Llyn Nyddwr.\nIt's one of his favorite napping spots.
15	Za1	Look, if you're going, I'll come too.\nCan't have you inconveniencing\nyourselves alone on his behalf.
evt/nq/msg_nq110903f.json
0	Za1	Bambam?!
1	2	He's surrounded!
2	Za1	Oh no, oh no, oh no!!!\nWhat do we do? What do we DO?!
3	3	Is this how Colony 4 raises its\nsoldiers? Ugh, come on, team,\nlet's solve everyone's problems.
4	1	Let's save Bambam!
5	5	Always time for a little rescue!
evt/nq/msg_nq110904f.json
0	aa1	Thanking you! Thank to you,\nBambam live to skive another day!
1	1	No need for thanks. Let's just get back\nto the colony as quick as we can, OK?
2	Za1	Yeah, come on, Bambam. If you drag\nyour feet you'll get a whack from Dinzel.
3	aa1	What Bambam care? Bambam\ndo what Bambam want!
4	aa1	And right now Bambam famfamished!\nBambam starve to die before\nreach colony if not eat soon.
5	Za1	...Huh, yeah, I haven't eaten\nsince this morning either.
6	2	Then shall we have\na bit of a rest now?
7	5	We flattened those monsters good, so we\nshould have a bit of breathing space.
8	9	If tum is empty then Manana your gal!\nManana cook beautiful meal!
9	aa1	Is true? That make Bambam very pleased!
10	Za1	I feel kind of bad for\nputting you out like this...
11	9	Manana very obliged if friends bring\nArdun Ribs for use as ingredients.
12	2	OK, we'll be back soon!
evt/nq/msg_nq110905f.json
0	aa1	So, friends make habit of\nstuff like this?
1	1	What do you mean?
2	aa1	Traveling everywhither for campings?
3	6	Well, not all the time...\nBut yeah, pretty much!
4	Za1	Sounds so cool...
5	aa1	Bambam could get used to such\ndegrees of freedom!
6	Za1	And since when are you not free?\nAvoiding work, taking lazy afternoon naps...
7	aa1	Dorin joyride in Levnis, so cast out\n2x4 in own eye before searching for\nPuzzletree Wood in eye of Bambam.
8	Za1	H-hey, I don't care!\nAnyway, that colony's just too stiff, man.
9	aa1	Bambam agree. Want to\ntravel more in outside world.
10	Za1	Man, yeah, traveling would be sweet.\nJust the two of us, camping like this.
11	Za1	...
12	aa1	...
13	9	Dinner is ready! Eat while hot!
14	Za1	Yes, dinner time!
15	aa1	It delicious by smell alone!
16	2	Let's eat, have a little rest, and\nthen get back to the colony.
17	6	(yawn)\nOK, we've been here a while now.
18	3	Wait, where did those\ntwo blockheads go?
19	2	Hm. They were there\nbefore we went to sleep.
20	5	Ugh, those two'll cause no end of trouble...
21	1	Oh, got a call from Dorin.
22	qZ106Za10	Good morning! Thanks for\nsaving Bambam yesterday!
23	10300	Yeah, but where are you?!
24	qZ104Za10	Sorry, but we did a bit of thinking,\nand now Bambam and me are\nback in Colony 4.
25	10300	Well, at least you're OK.\nWhy did you leave so\nsuddenly, though?
26	qZ104Za10	Uh, so, there's something we\nhave to explain. But we're in\na bit of a pickle right now.
27	qZ108Za10	Sorry to make you run around like this,\nbut could you come back to Colony 4?\nWe'll be waiting for you wherever!
28	3	...He hung up on you? I don't even\nwanna know what these dingbats\nare on about now.
29	5	I guess now we go...back to Colony 4...?
evt/nq/msg_nq110906f.json
0	2	Well, where are Dorin and Bambam?
1	5	Queen's crispy fillets!
2	Za1	Here we gooo!
3	aa1	Bambam is freeeee!!!
4	3	...What.
5	Xa1	HEY, GET BACK HERE!!!
6	2	Dinzel, what's-?!
7	Xa1	Those delinquent lugheads! Just when\nI thought they'd come crawling back,\nthey jump in a Levnis and fly off!
8	6	What, now they've both gone...?
9	3	I'm lost. Somebody take me home...
10	5	What now? Are you\ngoing to haul them back?
11	Xa1	Those pampered, ungrateful brats? Ha!\nIf they're so set on dying in the\nwilderness, they have my blessing!
12	2	I don't think they're going to die in the\nwilderness or anything, but it's hard\nnot to be concerned...
13	1	It's not safe out there. Let's see if we\ncan convince them to come back.
evt/nq/msg_nq110907f.json
0	Za1	Hey, there you are!
1	aa1	We wait for you!
2	6	Are you joking? You just\nzoomed right past us!
3	Za1	We're free now!
4	5	Clear the dust out of your ears\nand listen. What are you talking\nabout?! Are you crazy?!
5	Za1	Me and Bambam talked it through! After\nwe heard how you lot live, we decided\nthat colony living just wasn't for us!
6	aa1	He right! That stubborn-head place\nonly oppress Bambam and Dorin!
7	aa1	We want travel same as you! We look\nfor way of life which not tie us down!\nWe free Nopon and man!
8	5	Queen's oath...
9	1	OK, that's enough of that kind of\ntalk. I think it's best if you go back\nto Colony 4 for now, yeah?
10	2	Right, we'll smooth\nthings over with Dinzel...
11	Za1	Nah, we've already decided!\nWe're free now!
12	3	Yeah, you said that already.\nWeren't you supposed to be looking\nout for fuzzy here?
13	aa1	Bambam and Dorin best friends\nas one! When one die, both dies!
14	Za1	Let's not get carried away.
15	aa1	...
16	Za1	But we can definitely do anything!\nAnd we'll be fine! Totally! For real!
17	1	O-OK, well, if we can't convince you,\nthen will you at least promise to be\ncareful?
18	aa1	Bambam proud Levnis owner!\nBambam invincible in this baby!
19	Za1	See you again, wherever\nthe wind takes us!
20	1	...Yeah, I'm worried about them.
21	4	We never had a hope of persuading\nthem to come back. Better to let\nthem do as they please.
22	3	I guarantee we're gonna run into them\nagain. When that happens we can just\ntry again, innit.
23	1	You're probably right...
evt/nq/msg_nq110908t.json
0	Xa1	I can't believe he's just toddled off on\na jaunt when there's work to be done!
1	Xa1	Hope he's not dead in a ditch\nsomewhere. Ugh, Bambam...
evt/nq/msg_nq110909t.json
0	Za1	I love how cozy it is to sit\naround the bonfire and eat!
evt/nq/msg_nq110910t.json
0	aa1	Bambam so ravenous...can't move...
1	aa1	Is dinner not ready? Bambam\nfeel self wasting away...
evt/nq/msg_nq111100f.json
0	kc1	Come on, Bambam! Go take a look!
1	lc1	Bambam too scare!
2	kc1	Hey, you're the one who's most\nannoyed by that noise!
3	lc1	Dorin noticed racket first!
4	5	Hi, yeah, what are you doing?
5	kc1	Oh nice, it's you!\nGood timing, mates!
6	kc1	There's been this terrifying noise\ngoing on for a while now!
7	lc1	It very petrifying!
8	kc1	So now we're trying to decide whether\nwe should go and see what's making it.
9	3	Do you make all your\ndecisions through fighting?
10	kc1	The problem is, what if it's something\nawful? That would be awful!
11	lc1	Certainly very awful! How Bambam and Dorin\ncontinue peaceful travels in such state?
12	kc1	To ashes with it all! Is this as\nfree as we're ever gonna be?!
13	lc1	Bambam not satisfy with that! Journey\nof Bambam only just beginning!
14	3	I can't with these two.
15	6	Hey. Since it's so important to you...\nWhat if we go look with you?
16	kc1	Would you?!
17	lc1	You do that for Bambam?!
18	2	If all you want is to know what's making\nthe noise, then it'll hardly take that long.
19	kc1	You're lifesavers! We\ntotally owe you for this!
20	lc1	You clearly old wing at traveling!
21	1	Well, we're not going to get much\ndone sitting around here. Let's head\ntoward the source of the noise.
evt/nq/msg_nq111101f.json
0	kc1	Is the noise coming from this?
1	1	It's a supply container.
2	8	It look like airdrop break it.\nThat sound of error.
3	kc1	Ohhh, that makes sense!\nHa, nothing to be scared of!
4	3	Can we just stop this racket?
5	kc1	Oh hey, wait a sec, what if\nyou just twiddle this here?
6	5	So we pretty much can't get at\nwhat's inside this container now?
7	lc1	Let Bambam see... It not so broken.\nAll it need is some elbow grease.
8	kc1	Ugh, if only we had the parts, we could\nmanage something. If only...
9	3	...Why, yes, we'd love to get these\nparts for you! Thank you for asking\nso nicely!
10	kc1	Aw, you're so generous!
11	lc1	Such magnanimosity!
12	kc1	The part you want is the Serenity Jet. You\nshould be able to find them easily around\nthe Old Kana Battlefield! ...Probably!
evt/nq/msg_nq111102f.json
0	1	We've got the parts you need,\nbut is this really enough to fix it?
1	kc1	Yeah, that's just the ticket! Let me\nshow you how the maintenance\nand development team gets it done!
2	lc1	Oh no, monster attracted by sound!
3	4	Once again, prolonged exposure to\nidiocy inconveniences us. These two\nshould come with a warning.
4	2	Oh, don't say that.\nThey're not bad people...
5	5	We'll take the monster,\nyou take the container!
6	kc1	Eeeek! Heeelp!
7	lc1	Bambam no want to die!\nBambam no want to die!
8	5	Oh, come on!
9	3	Let's just get this\nmonster whacked...
evt/nq/msg_nq111103f.json
0	kc1	And that's goodbye Mr. Lock!\nOpen at will, folks!
1	lc1	Nothing impossible for Bambam and friend,\nprodigal researchers-cum-developers,\nand sometime mechanics!
2	5	When did you get back...?
3	kc1	All righty, wonder what's gonna be inside!\nI hope it's food!
4	lc1	Bambam hoping for Tasty Sausage!
5	kc1	...The spark's this?
6	lc1	It not Tasty Sausage...
7	4	They're combat supplies.\nHm, so this actually turned out\nto be useful.
8	kc1	Eh, we don't need it.
9	3	How do you know?\nMay as well take it.
10	kc1	It's not like we're going to be fighting.
11	lc1	Dorin right. If not eatable, not valuable.
12	kc1	Yeah, we'll generously gift it\nto you! Thanks for the help!
13	5	Not gonna say no if\nyou're offering. Cheers.
14	kc1	Good! If you can use it, then consider\nit a little token of our appreciation!
15	lc1	Bambam in agreement! Very\nplease that it useful to friends!
16	kc1	Well, Bambam, I think it's time we\nhead off on our next adventure!
17	lc1	Let rip, friend!
18	3	Weren't they bickering at each\nother before? Guess they're\npretty easygoing...
evt/nq/msg_nq111104t.json
0	kc1	The part you want is the Serenity Jet. You\nshould be able to find them easily around\nthe Old Kana Battlefield! ...Probably!
1	lc1	Bambam and Dorin will wait\nand make prepare!
evt/nq/msg_nq111200f.json
0	de1	Urghhh, that is so rank!
1	ee1	What happen?!
2	de1	I said I wanted a nice meat dinner!\nWhy the spark would you ruin\nit by putting THAT in it?!
3	ee1	Eat only meat is bad for body!\nBambam put healthful ingredient-
4	2	What's the issue now?
5	de1	Oh hey, it's you again!\nListen to this!
6	de1	This one here's trying to kill me!\nSpiking my food with the worst\nthing in the world...Glare Aubergine!
7	3	...Give me strength.
8	ee1	Duty of cooking is split into shift, and\nBambam want make healthful food with\ngood ingredient for strength to travel far!
9	ee1	Is that so crime?! But Dorin only yell\nat poor Bambam. "It taste of yuck,\nso stop!" he yell.
10	5	Aw, no need to be so mean, Dorin!\nCan you not sort this out?
11	de1	No, no, no! Let me explain!
12	de1	Bodily health is fine, whatever, go for it,\nbut surely putting up with disgusting food\nis actually harming the health...of my soul!
13	de1	Even if he needs to put Glare Aubergines\nin my dinner, he could at least make\nan effort to make it taste like real food!
14	ee1	Bambam not kitchen slave to grant\nextravagant wishes of Dorin.\nIs nothing can be done.
15	6	I bet Manana has some ideas. Right?
16	9	Hohoho, of course Manana has ideas!\nManana can share secret of making\nthis ingredient sing!
17	de1	You'd do that? Hear that, Bambam?
18	ee1	Meh-meh, Bambam hear.\nPlease teach secrets.
19	9	Manana oblige! Before start,\nwe need find nectar of Bubblesia!
20	1	Is Bubblesia a flower?
21	9	Correct! It bloom at Amoney's Hallows.
22	1	OK, we can take care of providing\nthose. Dorin, you two make\nthe preparations for cooking.
23	de1	Can do!
evt/nq/msg_nq111201f.json
0	9	That plenty enough. Now,\nextractate nectar from picked\nflowers and-
1	de1	Yeah, whack it in! I love\na bit of sweetness!
2	9	"Whacking" is word unbecoming of chef!\nNot do that.
3	ee1	So what we do?
4	9	Smear nectar on tree over there.
5	6	What...will that do?
6	de1	Wait, we pour it on the tree?\nWe're gonna eat the tree?!
7	9	Have faith in Manana!\nFriends understand when time is right!
evt/nq/msg_nq111202f.json
0	1	OK, Manana, that should do it.
1	2	Can anyone else hear wings...?
2	ee1	Meh-meh! What coming?!
3	de1	Ahhhhhhh! Save me! Not\nbugs, anything but bugs!
4	9	Ingredient is arrive!\nEveryone, have at Plambus!
5	de1	That thing is "ingredients"?!\nIs this a joke?!
6	5	I mean, if it's coming at us,\nwe'd better take it out anyway!
evt/nq/msg_nq111203f.json
0	9	Good! Lots of fluids harvested.
1	ee1	We meant to eat...body fluids?
2	9	Plambus only eat flower nectar, so\nbody fluids very sweet and rich.
3	de1	Whoa, for real? ...It is still bug\njuices though. ...Bug juices, man...
4	9	Everyone think it icky at first,\nbut as Manana keep saying...\nTrust. In. Manana!
5	1	Well, let's go back\nto the campsite...
evt/nq/msg_nq111204f.json
0	9	Gently simmer Glare Aubergine and\nfermenting bug juice together.
1	9	Give quick singe at end for finishing touch!
2	9	And plate!
3	ee1	It smell of delicious!\nManana real master cheffypon!
4	de1	Bambam's right on that. But it is\nstill Glare Aubergine and bug juices...
5	9	You do tum disservice! Now\nshut mouth and try bite!
6	de1	O-OK, OK... One bite...
7	de1	...
8	1	...What's the verdict?
9	de1	It's...
10	de1	THE GREATEST THING\nI HAVE EVER EATEN?!
11	de1	But how?! It takes that gross vegetable\ntaste and augments it with a tart\nsweetness, giving it an almost fruity tang?!
12	ee1	Meh-meh-meh! Real true?!
13	de1	Feed me as many Glare Aubergines\nas you want!
14	ee1	This fabulous news!\nIt start of taste revolution!
15	ee1	Manana, please teach as\nmany recipe as possible!
16	9	It pleasure! Manana always\nlove to share wisdom of recipe\nwith world!
17	ee1	Thank you, great teacher!
18	de1	Bambam, you'd really learn all this\nfor me? You're the greatest friend\nan ex-mechanic could ever have!
19	9	Tasty food is important for long journey!\nEat lots and keep energy strong!
20	ee1	Bambam heed words of teacher!
21	de1	You heard the lady, Bambam!\nLet's gorge till we burst, then\nwe can get back on the trail!
22	ee1	It a deal, bestest friend!
23	6	Hey, don't we get any?
24	5	You thought they'd make any for us?
evt/nq/msg_nq111205t.json

evt/nq/msg_nq111207t.json
0	ee1	Flower that bloom in Amoney's Hallows...\nBambam very curious now!
1	de1	If you can really manage to make\nthat awful veggie smell somehow\nnice, I'll eat it through my nose!
2	ee1	E-eat through nose?!\nSurely you not speaking truth!
3	de1	...On second thoughts, probably not\nthe best aperture for the job, is it?
evt/nq/msg_nq111300f.json
0	fj1	Whaaat?! I can't believe you!
1	gj1	This slander and libel! Mismanagement\nof Dorin is blame!
2	3	Are they bickering again?!
3	1	What are you arguing about?
4	de1	I'll tell you what it's about! We came to\nthis island and then mysteriously some\nof our stuff has vanished!
5	de1	All our tools and cooking stuff,\nand things we really need while\nwe're traveling... Just gone!
6	ee1	Dorin was in charge of luggage!\nNot fault of Bambam!
7	de1	But you were the one carrying the\ncooking gear! It's all very convenient\nto blame me for that!
8	1	So I guess you're stuck here as\nlong as you don't have your gear.
9	de1	Sparks and ash! We can't keep the Levnis\nin good nick without tools, or cook dinner!\nWe're just gonna die out here, I guess!
10	ee1	Die? Bambam not want to die!\nHow can remediate?!
11	4	...Where were you when you\nrealized your gear was missing?
12	de1	Here, where we're camping.\nWill you help us look for it?!
13	3	Yeah, I guess this is what destiny led\nus here for. And letting you die out\nhere won't look good in Mio's diary.
14	de1	Thanks so much!\nYou've been amazing, really!
15	ee1	Seems like friends always save us,\nbut Bambam decide not to get\nbothered by that.
16	5	No, I think you really should.
17	1	We'll check around the campsite first.\nYou might have just overlooked it.
18	de1	We've already searched\npretty hard... But feel free!
evt/nq/msg_nq111301f.json
0	4	Look, footprints there.
1	fj1	It's a sandy beach, of\ncourse there are footprints.
2	4	These aren't human footprints. I think...
3		What made the footprints?
4		Gulkins
5		Merignas
6		Immovable Gonzalez
7	6	Maybe Gulkins?
8	4	No, I don't think so. Gulkin feet are webbed,\nwhich is not what we're seeing here.
9	3	We know who's been along this way,\ndon't we? Your friend and mine, Gonzalez.
10	1	No... If it was Gonzalez there wouldn't\nbe this many footprints.
11	2	Maybe Merignas?
12	4	I think so too. This is Merigna territory,\nso there's a decent chance.
13	fj1	Er, so, what...?
14	3	Oh give me strength. Vanished bags,\nplus mysterious footprints at the\nscene of the crime, equals...?
15	ee1	...MEH! Bambam know answer!\nOwner of footprint steal possessions of us!
16	fj1	Whaaat?!
17	4	It's a possibility, certainly, until we\nactually find your equipment.
18	1	Let's follow the footprints\nand see if we're right, then.
evt/nq/msg_nq111302f.json
0	fj1	Oh, look at that!
1	gj1	Merigna have gone into\nSea Lizards' Tide Pool!
2	4	Looks like I was right. And now...
3	2	Now we just have to try to\ncatch up without being seen.
evt/nq/msg_nq111303f.json
0	3	Is that a pile of supplies?
1	4	Looks like their spoils. They've probably\npiled it all here for safekeeping.
2	fj1	Is our stuff over there?!
3	1	I'd say there's a good\nchance, yeah. But first...
4	5	Time to take these thieves to task!
evt/nq/msg_nq111304f.json
0	fj1	Yes! Here's our stuff!
1	2	That's one problem solved, then.
2	fj1	It was those annoying\nMerignas, right, Bambam?
3	gj1	Yes! Thiefs of possessions\nof people are worst!
4	3	Just be careful in future, yeah? When you\nstrike out on your own, you gotta be able\nto solve your own problems.
5	fj1	Ugh, I know... We'll be\nmore responsible with\nour stuff from now on...
6	6	And try not to fight with each other!\nYou have to work together through\nthick and thin, OK?
7	gj1	Bambam understand\nand take to heart...
8	fj1	Ahhhhhh!!!
9	1	What now?!
10	fj1	The Levnis! We left it\nparked at the camp!
11	gj1	Meh-meh! We did do that!
12	fj1	Bambam, let's hurry! We're\ndone for if it gets nicked!
13	gj1	Bambam no want to be done for!\nTime for race of life!
14	5	...Safe travels!
evt/nq/msg_nq111305t.json
0	fj1	We're completely up the creek\nwithout our tools... Ugh, why are\nwe so powerless against fate...!
1	gj1	What this nonsense you saying?\nBrains of Dorin gone off in heat?
2	fj1	Oh, stuff it. If you can't be\ndramatic now, when can you?

0	rZ1	Vision of Dorin is very terrible!\nSo bad eyes.
1	qZ1	What kind of thing is that to say?!
2	rZ1	Bambam saw extremely giant monster!
3	qZ1	Look, if it was that extremely giant,\nI would definitely have seen it too!
4	4	I see it's that time again.
5	5	What's this about a giant monster?
6	rZ1	Yes, giant monster, seen by very eyes of\nBambam! Is giganto-normous monster!
7	qZ1	Yeah, but everything's gigantic\nto a little pipsqueak like you.
8	rZ1	Bambam can tell difference between\nmedium-big and big-big! And don't\ncall Bambam pipsqueak!
9	rZ1	Bambam begging friends to verify honesty\nof Bambam! We find proofs together!
10	4	Are you asking us to go\nhunting for a giant monster?
11	1	OK, well, where did you see it?
12	rZ1	Bambam see on Piula Path! Bambam taking\nwalk all innocent, and see by chance!
13	1	Well, I guess this is our business\ntoo, so we'll go with you.
14	rZ1	Such good friend!
15	qZ1	I thought I was your friend!\nUgh, I still think this is some\nwild goose chase stuff.
evt/nq/msg_nq111401f.json
0	6	According to Bambam, this\nshould be the place, right?
1	5	Yep. Don't see anything though.
2	4	Maybe he was mistaken in\nwhat he thought he saw.
3	rZ1	No mistakes in seeing! It was hunting\nhere and eated up other monster!
4	rZ1	Mehhh... Just remember\nit makes ears go wobbly...
5	1	A carnivorous monster, then?
6	3	We could always set out some\nbait and see if it comes out.
7	qZ1	Is that really going to work?
8	9	This sound like job for Manana,\nbespoke bait-maker of extraordinary!
9	9	If bait smell enticing enough,\nthen monster won't resist\nto come out and eat!
10	rZ1	Manana is best friend!!!
11	qZ1	Hey, I thought I was your best friend!\nBut whatever, let's give it a try, I guess...
12	1	What do you need, Manana?\nWe'll do some foraging for you.
13	9	Then Manana ask for Thick Ories Shank!
14	2	Thick Ories Shank, got it.
15	rZ1	Bambam and Dorin will get dinner ready\nback at camp. Thank for help, bye!
evt/nq/msg_nq111402f.json

1	9	And all finish!
2	5	Wow, that actually does look good.\nDoesn't smell bad either.
3	rZ1	Time to bait trap!
evt/nq/msg_nq111403f.json
0	1	That should do it. Now\nwe just have to wait.
1	2	Let's watch from a distance.
2	5	...

4	6	Looks like Bambam was\njust seeing things.
5	qZ1	I told you so... Anyway, it's\ncold out here, so let's just-
6	qZ1	...
7	rZ1	...
8	1	What is it?
9	qZ1	B...b...b...BEHIND YOU!
10	2	Behind who?
11	6	Monster!!!
12	3	Look at that, it was real\nafter all! And huge!
13	rZ1	Now you see! Now you see\nthat Bambam good honest\nNopon who not tell lie!!!
14	qZ1	Who cares about your honesty?\nWe're going to get eaten!
15	rZ1	...Eek! Why you say thing like that?!

evt/nq/msg_nq111404f.json
0	rZ1	You save us! We lucky to be alive...
1	qZ1	I didn't know you could even\nget them that big... I'm sorry for\never doubting you, Bambam.
2	rZ1	Bambam sorry for making us\nhave scary experience...
3	4	On the whole, curiosity is a virtue,\nbut it's better to avoid actual danger.
4	5	You got that right. You've\nonly got one life, you know.
5	qZ1	Yeah, don't I know it...
6	rZ1	Sound like it time to leave\nthis awful place then.
7	qZ1	Let's get in the Levnis and make tracks!
8	1	Try not to get attacked again next time.
9	qZ1	Don't worry, we'll go all sneaky-like,\nmonsters won't even see us!
10	qZ1	C'mon, Bambam!
11	rZ1	Stealthy-stealthy!
evt/nq/msg_nq111405t.json

1	rZ1	Calling Bambam liar is not on!\nBambam hate it as much as\nTorpedo wrap without Tasty Sausage!
2	qZ1	Yeah, yeah, I get it.
evt/nq/msg_nq111406t.json
0	qZ1	We thought we'd set out some bait,\nbut we've become the bait instead!
1	qZ1	This is a terrible outcome!!!

0	Za1	Doctor Oleshandra!
1	yZ1	Dorin? But I thought you'd\nleft Colony 4-
2	Za1	I need you to look at Bambam!\nHe's in a bad way, doc!
3	yZ1	Understood. Set him\ndown on that bed.
4	1	Oleshandra, how's Bambam?
5	yZ1	He's stable for now. My diagnosis\nis that he's been overworked.
6	Za1	Overworked...? I know the journey's\nbeen hard, but I didn't realize it had\nbeen that hard on him...
7	yZ1	Bambam has a weaker constitution\nthan most Nopon. It doesn't take\nmuch to push him over the edge.
8	Za1	What...?!
9	yZ1	I bet he had to go pretty easy\non his job in maintenance and\ndevelopment to avoid burnout.
10	Za1	...Wait, so you're saying when\nBambam was skiving off work\nhe was ACTUALLY...
11	yZ1	...Don't tell me you didn't\nknow about his health?
12	Za1	...
13	1	Oleshandra, is there anything\nthat can be done for him?
14	yZ1	Well... There is something.
15	Za1	There is? What?\nI'll do anything!
16	yZ1	There's a kind of mushroom, the\nSage Shroom, that grows on the\nHovering Reef 1.
17	2	Sage Shroom?
18	yZ1	Kukucha told me that it provides nutrients\nfor Nopon pretty much immediately.
19	yZ1	Boil that mushroom and mix\nit into a tonic, and maybe-
20	Za1	I'll pick a load right now!
21	yZ1	H-hey!
22	1	We're going too! Hovering Reef 1, yeah?
23	yZ1	Yeah, that's it. There are some\nawful monsters out that way,\nso be sure to take care.
24	5	More of a reason not to let that\njoker go haring off on his own.\nLet's catch up with him.
evt/nq/msg_nq111505f.json
0	1	Dorin!
1	Za1	...Hey, you lot came along too!
2	1	I didn't think we'd only catch up\nwith you here, though.
3	Za1	I ran that Levnis pretty hard. I knew\nif I didn't hurry then Bambam...
4	Za1	Oh, right, I found that mushroom\nthingy Doc Oleshandra mentioned.
5	5	Oh yeah?
6	Za1	Yeah! There's basically nothing but\nmushrooms on Hovering Reef 1, so\nI'm pretty sure it's the one...!
7	6	That's great, but I guess there\nwas no point in us coming along.
8	3	Yeah, you're on top of\nyour game today, Dorin.\nVery unlike you.
9	Za1	Mate, this is my best friend's life\nhanging in the balance here.\nSometimes you just have to step up and-
10	Za1	M-m-m-m-monster!!!
11	1	Run, Dorin!
12	Za1	Spark that! I didn't come all this way\njust to turn tail and run!
13	Za1	Me and that little furball've been\ntraveling all over! I'm way stronger\nthan I was before!
14	Za1	Any monsters that want to stop me\nwill get the old Dorin one-two! Raaargh!
15	1	Dorin, wait! ...We'd better back him up!
evt/nq/msg_nq111506f.json
0	2	Are you OK, Dorin?
1	Za1	Y-yeah... Did I do that?
2	5	You did get cold feet a bit, but you\nwere actually tearing it up out there\nonce you got started!
3	Za1	Huh... It was all so fast, just\na blur. I hardly remember...
4	Za1	Anyway, we'd better get\nthat mushroom back fast!
5	Za1	OK, got it! That Sage Shroom is mine!

4	Za1	Bambam! Why didn't you\ntell me about your health?
5	Za1	We were almost too late!\nDo you know what that means?!
6	aa1	...Bambam sorry. Bambam not\nwant to rain on parade of ours.
7	aa1	And Bambam health very good\nwhen travel with Dorin!
8	aa1	Only got overexcited by finally get\nfreedom Bambam always long for...
9	Za1	Bambam... Mate...
10	jn1	Well then, I'd heard you two'd been hauled\nback like so much baggage. You're looking\nin fine spirits.
11	Za1	B-boss! Er, let me-
12	Xa1	...So, did you enjoy yourselves?
13	aa1	Er, what...?
14	Xa1	You were on a Levnis joyride,\nweren't you? You sacked off\nyour jobs to go gallivanting about.
15	Xa1	No one goes to that\nmuch effort for nothing.\nAm I right?
16	Za1	Y-yeah!
17	Za1	Well, it was hard sometimes, but\nwe learned a lot of stuff too! Because\nwe had freedom!
18	aa1	He telling truth! We much\nstronger than before!
19	Za1	The world is our oyster!\nRight, best friend?
20	aa1	Right! Journey of Bambam\nand Dorin start now!
21	Xa1	...Huh! I see.
22	Xa1	You know, I was of a mind\nto slap you both silly when\nI finally saw you again.
23	Xa1	But seeing you both looking so\nstrong and full of life, I can't do it.
24	Za1	Oh, boss...!
25	aa1	Boss!!!
26	Xa1	Seeing as you're so appreciative,\nthen I may as well say this.
27	Xa1	If you're going to do something,\ndo it well. Half-arsing your lives is\nthe one thing I won't abide from you.
28	Xa1	Live life to the hilt, until you're satisfied.\nAnd don't come back to Colony 4 until\nthen. You get that, boys?
29	Za1	You heard the man, Bambam! Time\nto set off on our travels once again!\nIf you're up to it, that is.
30	aa1	Bambam in fine fettles! Thank to\neveryone, Bambam filled with bean!
31	Za1	That's the spirit, best friend!\nLet's go! Freedom awaits!
32	aa1	Forward and upward!
33	1	Are you sure you don't mind\nthem just walking out again?
34	Xa1	Obviously it's not great. But these aren't\nlads who are going to just follow orders.
35	Xa1	Back when I was a new recruit, I was\npretty reckless. I still have a soft spot\nfor that type, you know?
evt/nq/msg_nq111508t.json
0	yZ1	Kukucha says that Sage Shrooms\nare packed with Nopon nutrients.
1	yZ1	If we can get some, then we can help\nBambam for sure... It's just that Hovering\nReef 1 is full of dangerous monsters.

1	4	Something bothering you, Noah?\nYour brow is awfully furrowed.
2	1	...Huh? Oh, sorry, I didn't realize\nI was making a face.
3	2	Is there something on your mind?
4	1	Yeah... It's nothing too important, though.
5	3	Oh reallllly? Sure you're not\nremembering the thing about\nthe husks?
6	5	Ah yeah, that has to be it.
7	1	Gh...! Am I really that easy to read?
8	3	We've known each other for so long,\nof course we can read your mind by now.
9	6	You're talking about the husks that were\nleft near that "Singbreeze Funnel" place?
10	4	It will be dangerous to send them off.\nThey're right inside monster territory.
11	2	Is it really bothering you\nthat much?
12	1	...To be honest, I don't think I can let it go.
13	1	At the same time though, it feels wrong\nto put everyone in danger just because\nI'm feeling uneasy...
14	5	Holding back like that isn't like you.\nWe'd rather you just ask us, straight up.
15	5	And anyway, not like anyone here would\nobject to sending off the husks?
16	2	Of course not. I've been\nin favor of it from the start.
17	6	Right! We have to give them\na proper send-off...
18	4	Noah, Mio, you're the off-seers here.\nYou should make the judgment call.
19	1	I'm sorry, everyone...\nAh, no, scratch that.
20	1	Thank you, for going\nalong with me on this.
evt/nq/msg_nq111701f.json

1	1	Yes, I think so, too. Thank you\nall for helping me with this.

3	2	...Yeah. I really hope it does.
evt/nq/msg_nq120100s.json
0	6	There sure are plenty of Nopon\nin Colony 30, huh?
1	4	We certainly don't have any\ncolonies in Agnus with that\nmany Nopon.
2	3	Crazy.
3	3	Oh yeah, talking of crazy, looks like\nsomebody weird was bound to show\nup among all those furballs.
4	3	I think one of them is going round\nplaying an off-seer's flute?
5	5	Yeah, I've heard that too.
6	5	But his playing's kind of crappy\nand it's cheesing everyone off...
7	1	He's playing it around the colony...\nCould he be training?
8	2	I think you might be right.
9	2	Speaking of which, in Keves you\ntake a training course to become\nan off-seer, right?
10	2	Can Nopon take that course\nto become off-seers too?
11	1	I suppose. There were never any Nopon\nwhen I had my training, at least.
12	2	A Nopon training to be an off-seer...\nI kind of want to meet this guy!
13	3	All right then, shall we drop by the\nColony 30 residential district? People've\nbeen hearing a flute there a lot.
14	1	Let's do it.

3	2	Hm?
4	2	What was that about?
5	1	Looks like something's going on.
6	2	Let's do a bit of asking around\nand then come back and talk\nto the Nopon.
7	1	Good plan. Let's see what the\npeople of Colony 30 have to say.
evt/nq/msg_nq120102t.json
0	oa1	The Nopon with the off-seer flute?\nYeah, that's See-Mee-Mee.
1	1	Why is a Nopon training to\nbe an off-seer?
2	oa1	I'm pretty sure it was to take Radek's\nplace after he was killed in battle, so\nColony 30 would still have an off-seer.
3	oa1	Those two were really close.
4	1	Oh, I see...
evt/nq/msg_nq120103t.json

15	ja1	Friend of See-Mee-Mee\nwas colony off-seer.
16	ja1	So See-Mee-Mee have to send off.
17	ja1	See-Mee-Mee have favor to ask.
18	ja1	Teach off-seeing melody to See-Mee-Mee.
19	ja1	Then...
20	ja1	Then take See-Mee-Mee\nto where Radek is.

12	ja1	OK.
13	ja1	Who send off-seer?\nIn past, See-Mee-Mee ask Radek this.
14	ja1	Radek say he can't die because\nduty of Radek is to send everyone.

49	ma1	Prepare to head back!
50	bp1	Roger!
51	ma1	You've spared us from who knows how\nmany senseless battles. Thank you.
52	1	And say hi to Ven for us.
53	ma1	Commander, we're going\nback to Colony 30.
54	H	Got it. Take care.
evt/nq/msg_nq120202t.json
0	la1	Have you seen the third unit's Levnises?\nThey're late coming back, and I don't\nmind admitting I'm worried.
1	la1	I warned them time and again not to\nneglect their maintenance. Ugh, Erun...!
2	la1	Snuff it... Could you go out and see\nwhat's what, then see what Yuzet\nhas to say about it?
evt/nq/msg_nq120300s.json
0	5	Valdi, aren't you Colony 30's commander?
1	H	Yup!
2	5	It's just that people in Colony 30 seem\nto really rely on this Yuzet guy...
3	H	Oh, and how!
4	H	Yuzet is my aide, he takes care\nof a ton of jobs for me!
5	1	What do you usually do\nin the colony, Valdi?
6	H	Uh, build Levnises?
7	5	So basically, you leave all your\ncommanderly duties to your poor mate?
8	H	Uh-huh! He really helps me out.
9	5	Valdi, are you really OK with that?
10	5	Weren't you gonna figure out "the best\nway to protect everyone"?
11	5	If you're gonna do that, don't you\nneed to keep more of an eye on all\nthese things?
12	H	Huh...
13	H	Yeah, I think you're right, Lanz!
14	3	Right, so?\nWhaddya wanna do?
15	H	Hmmmmm...
16	H	Yuzet will know, I bet!
17	H	Let's go talk to him!
evt/nq/msg_nq120301f.json
0	H	Yuzet! Guess what!
1	ha1	Can you not see\nthat I'm working?
2	H	I *can* see! And thanks for that, by the way!
3	ha1	Well... As long as you notice.
4	3	Anyone else having trouble telling\nwhich one is the commander?
5	H	Yuzet! Let's do something!
6	ha1	Oh, you want to "do something", do you?
7	ha1	We need to restore calm to the colony.\nThat takes priority.
8	1	Has there been any unrest since\nthe Flame Clock was broken?
9	oa1	Would I call it unrest...?
10	ha1	It's just that now the fighting has stopped,\nLevnis maintenance isn't so vital.
11	ha1	Everyone's whinging about how they've\ngot nothing to do all day. It's driving me\nup the wall...
12	H	We're all looking for something\nto do, me included.
13	H	Oh, everyone can pitch in on Dorrick!
14	1	Dorrick...? Is that this big Levnis?
15	H	Yeah!
16	H	I said I'd make it the best\nLevnis there ever was.
17	5	That's the one the\nConsul ordered built?
18	H	Will you help me with it?
19	8	Meh-meh.
20	8	Riku suppose some advice\nnot go amiss.
21	H	Yay!
22	ha1	I can't stop you working on it,\nbut you can't raid our materials for it.
23	H	Understood!
24	H	I'll keep salvaging\nstuff myself!
25	H	Guys, let's build a Levnis!
26	4	What exactly do we gain by finishing it?
27	ha1	Nothing.
28	ha1	But as long as it keeps the Nopon\nhappy, you'll be doing me a favor.
29	3	He's not very commander-like,\nbut he does care about the colony.
30	1	We can help out with\nscavenging materials.
31	1	What do you say, Lanz?
32	H	You're gonna help?!
33	5	Yeah, go on. I'm the one who\ntold you to find something to do.
34	H	Thanks!
35	H	Repapa's the one in charge\nof the Dorrick project.
36	H	He'll be able to tell you what's needed!
37	5	Cool.
evt/nq/msg_nq120302t.json
0	pa1	Valdi been great help.\nRepapa thank you, as befits chief.
1	1	Chief?
2	pa1	Valdi trained as mechanic alongside\nRepapa under masterpon.
3	pa1	Basically, Repapa look after Valdi a lot.
4	pa1	Right now is Dorrick and Mechafriend,\nand also look after Yuzet when have time.\nIs so good chief!
5	pa1	Anyway, friends say friends want\nfind materials. That very kind!
6	1	What should we do?
7	pa1	Meh! First is get lots of materials\nfrom Aetia and Fornis regions.
8	pa1	Materials need thorough check,\nso bring first to Repapa.
9	pa1	Area around Colony 30 full\nof Stinger Piles, ripe for taking.
10	pa1	Get quick-picking!
11	pa1	Have friends found materials?
12	pa1	Is not enough yet.\nRepapa need plenty more materials\nfrom Aetia and Fornis regions!
evt/nq/msg_nq120303t.json
0	ha1	The Nopon are always at me, asking\nfor things. You're really helping me out.
evt/nq/msg_nq120304f.json
0	pa1	O-ho-ho! Phase two completed!
1	H	Thanks, everyone!
2	1	Phase two...?
3	pa1	Meh! So far, Repapa only cobble\ntogether parts on hand.
4	pa1	Finally can build all-important section!
5	pa1	Then phase three start! Is finish\nin no time if we work like this!
6	1	Just wondering...how much\nfurther is there still to go?
7	pa1	It finish at phase ten.
8	3	You what, mate?!
9	8	We say we help.\nWe see through to end.
10	5	...Sounds like someone's\nstarted enjoying himself.
11	H	Doesn't it?!
12	pa1	O-hoho! Keep collect material\nand bring to Repapa!
13	H	Dorrick's going to be the protector we've\nalways needed. Our mighty guardian!
14	5	Yeah? Can't wait for it to be done.
15	H	Just watch me go!
evt/nq/msg_nq120400f.json
0	pa1	Meh-meh-meh-meh-meh!
1	H	What is it, Repapa?
2	3	What?!
3	pa1	Meh! Meh!
4	5	M-Mechafriend?
5	6	Oh no, this is terrible!\nWhat happened?
6	pa1	Oh, it in pieces for maintenance.
7	5	Don't scare us like that!
8	pa1	You only get wrong assumption!
9	2	Then what are you in a flap about?
10	pa1	Meh-meh! I tell you!
11	8	Parts of Mechafriend missing.
12	9	Repapa lose pieces?
13	pa1	Meh! Repapa have all\npieces before talk to you!
14	pa1	Repapa in trouble...
15	pa1	Construction of Dorrick not even\npossible without Mechafriend.
16	pa1	And...
17	5	Valdi?
18	H	It's all fine! Mechafriend isn't broken.
19	6	This is going to break\npoor Valdi's heart.
20	4	We can't preclude the possibility\nthat someone took the parts by mistake.
21	1	Right. Let's ask around the colony.
evt/nq/msg_nq120401t.json
0	1	Have you seen any of Mechafriend's\nparts? It looks like someone picked\na few up by mistake.
1	oa1	Oh, so that's what it was.
2	oa1	Dinkidinki was holding onto\nsome Mechafriend parts.
3	oa1	She asked where to hide things\nwhere they'd never be found...
4	oa1	I told her, um, Sparres Barr...
5	1	Thanks!
evt/nq/msg_nq120402t.json
0	2	Have you seen any Mechafriend parts\nlying around? Someone might have\ntaken them.
1	na1	Oh no! That's awful!
2	na1	It's probably more efficient to\njust replace the parts than try\nto collar the perp.
3	na1	I heard you can pick up some good\nLevnis parts at Bittley Slope.
4	2	Makes sense. Thank you!
evt/nq/msg_nq120403t.json
0	1	Have you seen any of Mechafriend's\nparts knocking about? Someone\nmight have accidentally taken some.
1	la1	People are always going in and out\nof maintenance. Sorry, I haven't\nseen anything.
2	la1	Oh, wait, have you\nseen Widgewidge?
3	la1	He said he had something to do at\nLisza Garden. And he was carrying\na massive bag.
4	1	We haven't seen him... We'll\ntell him you were looking for\nhim if we do, though.
5	la1	Ta.
6	la1	Widgewidge's been competing an\nawful lot with Mechafriend lately.
7	la1	He seemed pretty down in the\ndumps, some days, too. I wish\nhe'd open up to me...
evt/nq/msg_nq120404s.json
0	1	So, about Mechafriend.
1	1	Do you get the feeling that those parts\nweren't lost, but stolen?
2	H	What?!
3	4	I was thinking along those lines too.
4	5	But the important thing is\nfixing up Mechafriend, right?
5	3	Innit!
6	3	Finding parts for Mechafriend's gonna\nbe faster than hunting down the thief.
7	2	Right!
8	2	It should be easily fixed if we\ncan gather the parts, correct?
9	H	Yep!
10	2	Once we've got the parts we can\ntake them to Repapa to fix.
11	1	We've got some information on\nwhere we can scavenge up some\nparts for Mechafriend.
12	1	It looks like there are a few places\nof interest, so let's get searching.
evt/nq/msg_nq120405t.json
0	1	Wait, that looks like Mechafriend's...
1	5	Are these pieces of Mechafriend?
2	3	Looks like some Mechafriend to me.
3	2	Could this be the missing\nMechafriend parts?
4	4	If I'm not mistaken, these may\nbe the pilfered Mechafriend parts.
5	6	I'm pretty sure these are\nthe Mechafriend parts.
evt/nq/msg_nq120406t.json
0	1	We should be able to use this.
1	5	I wonder if they could\nuse this for Mechafriend.
2	3	Eh, they can bung this in\nMechafriend, I'm sure.
3	2	I think this looks OK?
4	4	I'm sure a part of this kind could\nfind a good home in Mechafriend.
5	6	Oh, pretty! Someone could\ndefinitely use this!
evt/nq/msg_nq120407t.json
0	1	Looks like someone tried\nto hide this part...
1	5	Is this what Widgewidge was carrying?!
2	3	Whoa! Is this one of Mechafriend's parts?
3	2	It really looks like someone\nhid this. I wonder...
4	4	Someone tried to hide it.\nBut somewhat incompetently.
5	6	What is this doing here?
evt/nq/msg_nq120408t.json
0	pa1	How go search for Mechafriend parts?\nRepapa so busy, Repapa entrust\nimportant task to you!
1	pa1	Once all part found, Repapa\nrepair in blink of eye!
evt/nq/msg_nq120409f.json
0	pa1	Well done finding parts!\nNow Repapa do repairing magic!
1	H	I'll pitch in too!
2	pa1	Valdi will be here soon,\nand we fix together!
3	ia1	...
4	1	A testament to your skills.
5	H	It wouldn't have gone\nso fast without Repapa.
6	8	Backup work perfect!
7	8	Noah, Riku send data of Mechafriend to\nIris now. It help in search for perpetrator.
8	8	Want look at Mechafriend data?
9	1	Sure. It could help show us who it was\nthat took off with those parts.
10	1	Two Nopon working in cahoots...
11	pa1	Meh-meh?! Dinkidinki and Widgewidge!
12	5	Caught red-winged.\nNow we know who hid the parts.
13	3	Time to catch 'em and\nhaul 'em in front of Yuzet.
14	5	Let's get 'em!
evt/nq/msg_nq120410t.json
0	1	So, you're one of the ones who\ntook Mechafriend's parts.
1	qa1	Meh-meh-meh!\nWho rat out Dinkidinki?
2	qa1	Oh well. Dinkidinki\nfull of remorse anyway.
3	1	You'd better get to Yuzet.\nYou owe the people of\nColony 30 an apology.
4	qa1	Dinkidinki understand...
evt/nq/msg_nq120411t.json
0	1	We have it on good authority\nthat you're one of the culprits\nwho took Mechafriend's parts.
1	ra1	Meh... If Pippito out of bag then\nWidgewidge come quietly...
2	ra1	Take Widgewidge\nto slammer.
3	1	We're taking you to Yuzet.\nYou owe the people of\nColony 30 an apology.
4	ra1	Widgewidge accept fate with grace...
evt/nq/msg_nq120412f.json
0	ha1	So you're telling me these Nopon\nare responsible for hiding\nMechafriend's parts.
1	H	But why be so mean to Mechafriend?
2	qa1	Dinkidinki love huge Dorrick.
3	qa1	But Dorrick always\nwith Mechafriend...
4	ra1	Widgewidge only jealous of screwdriver\ntechnique of Mechafriend.
5	ra1	Is much more advance\nthan Widgewidge can do.
6	ra1	Widgewidge know\nValdi not like it, but...
7	qa1	If Mechafriend out of picture, then\nonly us work with Dorrick.\nPulipuli say so.
8	qa1	So that why...
9	H	Ah, I see.
10	ra1	Is responsibility of ours.
11	ra1	Widgewidge leave now.\nThank for everything.
12	H	Hey, where are you going?
13	H	Let's build Dorrick together!
14	H	Making stuff is way more\nfun when you do it together!
15	qa1	Valdi...
16	1	It's a nice sentiment, but I don't know...
17	ha1	They've learned their lesson.\nThat's enough for me.
18	2	You can't exactly hold Nopon\nto military regulations.
19	ha1	Oh yeah, and Nopon? Next time you\neven think about causing trouble,\nI'll put you on cleaning duty!
evt/nq/msg_nq120500s.json
0	5	Wasn't this Pulipuli guy involved\nin hiding those Mechafriend parts?
1	5	I've got a bit of a bone to pick with him.
2	1	He's the one who goaded Widgewidge\nand Dinkidinki into making trouble...
3	3	But with a name like that,\nhe's a Nopon too, right?
4	5	Back then we couldn't really get\na handle on what he was about.
5	1	That's for sure.
6	H	Pulipuli came to Colony 30 a little\nbefore I first met you guys.
7	H	I haven't talked to him much, either,\nso it'd be nice to get to know him better!
8	1	Let's have a word with him\nif we find him.
evt/nq/msg_nq120501f.json
0	5	You Pulipuli?
1	sa1	Meh-meh-meh!
2	sa1	It you guys!
3	5	Hey, get back here!
4	6	Why did he run away?
5	3	Something fishy going on, definitely.\nSmells like guilt.
6	5	Let's get after him!
evt/nq/msg_nq120502f.json
0	5	Hey, whatcha scribbling there?
1	5	"Doing best and working hard\nfor Alexandria! Please give many\npraises as reward!"
2	sa1	Mehhhhhhhh?!
3	sa1	Don't look at thing without ask!\nYou very rude character!
4	4	Alexandria?
5	4	The Alexandria who's the commander\nof Colony Iota? That Alexandria?
6	1	What exactly were you working\nso hard for her on? And I recommend\nbeing as detailed as possible.
7	2	From where I'm standing,\nit looks like you were doing\nintelligence work.
8	sa1	Meh-meh! This nothing\nto do with Alexandria!
9	sa1	Pulipuli free agent,\nact only for self!
10	6	Wait, Alexandria?
11	sa1	M-m-meh!
12	K	...
13	K	Who's this?
14	1	Isn't he a friend of yours?
15	K	Not to my knowledge.\nSequoia's in charge of intelligence...
16	K	I don't think she uses Nopon though.
17	K	She'd never risk being\nuncovered like this.
18	sa1	M-meh...
19	sa1	Pulipuli like Alexandria\nso much...but now very very sad.
20	K	Well... What do you want\nme to do about that?
21	1	I feel like we shouldn't\nbe addressing this alone.
22	1	We should put this to Colony 30.
23	5	Then we should see Yuzet.
evt/nq/msg_nq120503f.json
0	ha1	OK, let me see if I've got it right.
1	ha1	This Nopon was intending\nto pass Colony 30 intelligence\non to another colony?
2	ha1	In addition, hoping to cause rifts\nwithin the colony, he masterminded\nthis plan to steal Mechafriend's parts?
3	5	Yeah, that's about it.
4	sa1	Pulipuli not let Colony 30\ndefeat Alexandria.
5	sa1	So Pulipuli defeat Colony 30 instead,\nand make Alexandria happy! That plan.
6	3	Well.
7	K	I understand why you did it.
8	K	But doing something without\nmy asking isn't going to make\nme happy.
9	sa1	Meh...
10	5	So, what now,\nCommander Valdi?
11	H	Good question.
12	H	I don't want my\nfriends to be hurt.
13	H	So, Pulipuli, can't we all just\nbe friends and get along?
14	sa1	Valdi...
15	sa1	Pulipuli sorry! Pulipuli\nfeel so huge remorse!
16	H	All is forgiven!
17	5	...Really?
18	K	I hope we don't\nlive to regret this...
19	2	Valdi says he forgives him.
20	sa1	Pulipuli have change of\nheart and work very hard now!
evt/nq/msg_nq120600s.json
0	5	How's Colony 30 been since\nlast time?
1	6	You're still short on ether?
2	H	Yeah. Yuzet and the others are\nreally feeling it. I wish there was a\nway I could help.
3	5	Whoa, am I hearing things?\nNever thought I'd see the day!
4	5	Knowing you, I thought you'd only\ncare because you couldn't build Levnises.
5	H	Repapa said the same thing.
6	H	But you know...
7	H	I had a talk with Isurd about\nsharing some of his ether, so I'm\ngonna go pick it up!
8	4	You talked to the commander?
9	H	I wonder if I can get a little more\nout of the other colonies...
10	H	If I do that, we could get back\nto work on Dorrick...
11	3	How much do you need?
12	H	Repapa mentioned we'd need\n2,500 ether cylinders.
13	5	2,500?!
14	6	Oof, I think that's something\nwe can't really help out with...
15	2	Hmm...
16	2	Then how about Colony 30 earns their\nether from other colonies in exchange for\nsome kind of service?
17	2	Like when they lent Colony Lambda\nLevnises.
18	1	Good idea.
19	1	Maybe we could send Colony 30\nmechanics out on jobs?
20	4	Their mechanics are highly rated.
21	4	High enough to field a Levnis unit\nthat can beat Silver colonies.
22	H	Oh cool!
23	H	I'd love to go meet Levnises\nfrom other colonies!
24	6	You're gonna go, Valdi?
25	5	No way Yuzet will let that happen.
26	H	Whaaaat?
27	3	Don't you have a whole fleece\nof Nopon sitting about with nothing\nto do?
28	H	Oh, that's right! They can help out!
29	H	But who should I pick?\nI could ask Repapa...
30	5	You've got a bunch who owe\nyou a pretty huge favor.
31	5	Dinkidinki, Widgewidge and Pulipuli.
32	3	Nice, let's give 'em the good news.
evt/nq/msg_nq120601t.json
0	3	We're looking for someone who\ncan go and run maintenance on\nother colonies' Levnises.
1	3	If it goes smoothly, you can\nget back to work finishing Dorrick.\nWhat do you reckon?
2	qa1	Work on Dorrick?!\nOf course Dinkidinki help!
3	4	Wait for us with Repapa\nand we'll tell you more.
evt/nq/msg_nq120602t.json
0	1	We're looking for mechanics\nwho can travel to other colonies.
1	1	Would you like to help?\nYou'd be doing Valdi a favor.
2	ra1	For Valdi? Widgewidge see.\nWidgewidge happy to help!
3	2	Thank you. Could you wait\nfor us at Repapa's place?
evt/nq/msg_nq120603t.json
0	6	We're looking for mechanics who'd\nbe willing to go to other colonies!
1	6	It'd really help Valdi out!
2	sa1	Pulipuli can go to Colony\nIota too? Pulipuli do it!
3	5	Good man! Wait for us at\nRepapa's place, yeah?
evt/nq/msg_nq120604f.json
0	pa1	In short! We sending mechanic to\nother colony on temporary assignment!
1	pa1	This is big-time plan to\nget ether cylinders in return.
2	pa1	First we send advance team to each\ncolony. To open negotiation in person!
3	qa1	Oh-hoh! And that our job?
4	H	That's right!
5	ra1	This is request for no other than Valdi,\nso Widgewidge accept role as negotiator!
6	H	D'aww, thanks!
7	pa1	Meh-hem!
8	pa1	Now we decide who\ngo to which colony!
9	pa1	First, Dinkidinki.
10		Where will you send her?
11		Colony Tau
12		Colony 9
13		Colony Gamma
14	H	Colony Tau it is!
15	qa1	Dinkidinki do you proud!
16	H	Colony 9 it is!
17	H	Colony Gamma it is!
18	pa1	Next is Widgewidge.
19		Where will you send him?
20		Colony Lambda
21		Colony 11
22	H	Lambda's a good colony!
23	ra1	Widgewidge accept!
24	H	11's a good colony!
25	pa1	And last is Pulipuli.
26		Where will you send him?
27		The City
28		Colony Iota
29		Colony Mu
30	H	Off to the City with you!
31	5	Hang on, we're including the City\nin all this?
32	H	Yep!
33	sa1	Not send to Colony Iota?!
34	H	Nope! Give our regards!
35	H	Off to Colony Iota with you!
36	sa1	Colony Iota?! Ohoho!!!
37	sa1	Pulipuli go straight away!\nRight now! This instant!
38	H	Off to Colony Mu with you!
39	pa1	Everything look good!\nGood luck everyone, and-
40	H	Now, where can we send you, Repapa...?
41	pa1	Meh! Repapa go also?!
42	H	Are you not going?
43	pa1	Mehhh...
44	pa1	R-Repapa understand! Repapa\nhappy to help out, as chief!
45	pa1	Repapa will get one thousand\nether cylinder! Or one million!
46		Repapa go wherever Repapa sent!
47		Colony 4
48		Agnus Castle
49		Fort O'Virbus
50	H	How about Colony 4?
51	pa1	Leave it to Repapa!
52	H	How about Agnus Castle?
53	H	How about Fort O'Virbus?
54	pa1	Everyone leave when ready!
55	4	...So I hear that none of the\nNopon we sent out have returned.
56	6	Maybe negotiations aren't\ngoing too well?
57	H	I'm a bit worried, so I've been\nplanning to check on them.
58	H	And I've always wanted to see\neveryone else's Levnises, so\ntwo birds with one stone!
59	5	Then let's get going!
60	H	Hmmm...
61	H	There might not be any more colonies\nwhere we have friends!
62	3	...So I guess that'll be that for\nvisiting other colonies?
63	H	No, we should go too!!!
64	5	You're just itching to gawk at\nLevnises, aren't you...?
65	H	So!
66	H	I'll go!
67	6	Um, where are you going?
68	H	To colonies we aren't friendly with yet!
69	9	That good idea! Valdi got\ngood head on shoulder!
70	3	Not a single thought for where,\nor whether they're at war, or anything.
71	2	But there must be places that\nstill have a Flame Clock.
72	2	Places where we haven't broken\nMoebius's control yet.
73	1	True. We'll need more allies\nif we're to fight back against them.

7	ra1	Widgewidge determine to bring\nback plenty of ether for Valdi.
8	4	It'd be doing me a favor too.
9	zc1	If you vouch for him, Taion, then...\nAll right. I'll ready some more for you.

8	H	Thanks, all!
evt/nq/msg_nq120619f.json
0	3	...So I guess that'll be that for\nvisiting other colonies?
1	H	No, we should go too!!!
2	5	You're just itching to gawk at\nLevnises, aren't you...?
3	H	Hmmm...
4	H	There might not be any more colonies\nwhere we have friends!
5	H	Hmm...
6	H	There aren't really many more\ncolonies where we have friends.
7	H	So!
8	H	I'll go!
9	6	Um, where are you going?
10	H	To colonies we aren't friendly with yet!
11	9	That good idea! Valdi got\ngood head on shoulder!
12	3	Not a single thought for where,\nor whether they're at war, or anything.

0	5	Whoa.
1	5	It's amazing when\nyou really look at it.
2	pa1	Repapa show more\nbig surprise things!
3	pa1	Mechafriend! Start Dorrick!
4	pa1	Test is begin!
5	pa1	Buddy Blaster, fire!
6	4	What the...?
7	1	Did it just attack those Levnises...?
8	pa1	What Dorrick possess is not regular\nrunning-the-mill weapon!
9	pa1	Is also high-frequency device to\naccess Auto-Lev control system!
10	5	Small word version?
11	H	Dorrick can make friends with Levnises!
12	H	Y'see, the way it works is by applying\nRobobuddy's data to interfere with\nthe ether signaling.
13	5	I'll just assume that's\nsomething clever.
14	pa1	Correct!
15	H	This laser was made with the intention\nof altering the ether signaling circuits\nof Auto-Levs.
16	H	But when they read our Iris data,\nthey saw us as allies!
17	H	Changing the system means you can\nrewrite the aggression program.\nSo if you take Mechafriend's signal-
18	5	...
19	4	Do you get it?
20	pa1	Meh?
21	6	Um...
22	H	Hmm, I don't think it's gone in.
23	8	It not seem usable in combat.
24	pa1	Mehhh...
25	pa1	It only work with one nearby Levnis.
26	pa1	Is distance problem, or number of\ntarget? Have to research.
evt/nq/msg_nq120702s.json
0	H	So, chief, how do you think we\ncan improve the Buddy Blaster?
1	XW1	That outside area of\nexpertise of Riku.
2	H	Ugh, if you can't help,\nwho can I ask?
3	6	I guess a mechanic who knows\na lot about a lot of stuff?
4	4	You could always bring it to\nColony Lambda's engineering corps?
5	4	Varen could probably give\nsome useful insight.
6	2	What about the people\nin the City?
7	2	They've got a lot of technology we\ndon't have. Maybe Mr. Samon could help?
8	3	The folks over at Colony Iota\ncould be useful and all?
9	1	There was that time we had\nour Irises meddled with and our\nauthorization revoked...
10	5	By Salazar, yeah?\nThat was a wild ride...
11	1	Plus that colony came up\nwith Collectopaedia Cards.
12	H	Oh yeah! Plenty of options, then!
13	H	Let's go and consult with\nsome of those people, then!
14	H	Let's get on the road, chief!
15	XW1	Meh?!
evt/nq/msg_nq120703t.json
0	gl1	...Samon see.

2	H	Can you do it?
3	gl1	Samon not able to say\nwithout see real thing.
4	H	OK, I'll bring the Buddy Blaster here!
5	gl1	It very large, Samon assume.\nWould be difficult to bring.
6	gl1	But Samon too busy\nfor visit Colony 30.
7	H	Boo...
8	gl1	How about this?
9	gl1	Samon lend you friend of Samon.\nShinoh can be help for you.
10	gl1	Can find Shinoh in Astelle Harbor.\nSamon will send informations.
evt/nq/msg_nq120704t.json

2	cb1	Meep... I would, but I'm, uh,\nin the middle of some pretty\ndelicate research right now...
3	cb1	Oh, oh! But you can have this\ninstead of me!

2	H	So, can you help me\nimprove the Buddy Blaster?
3	cl1	But of course. I haven't been\nable to do anything like this in\nages! Should be a lot of fun.
4	cl1	Going by what I heard, I'd say the\nproblem is the structure of the weapon.
5	cl1	The laser diffuses quite a bit.\nWhat if we concentrate the beam?
6	cl1	If you have a Dowdy Armor Kernel\nand a Gloss Reactor I can make some\nadjustments.
7	H	OK, I'll get those for you!
8	cl1	I like that enthusiasm.
9	cl1	I'll go ahead to Colony 30.
10	cl1	Oof, my back...
11	5	Are you OK? Doesn't getting\nolder make it harder to move?\nLook after yourself!
12	cl1	Aren't you a dear? My son's\na Levnis pilot, so don't worry.\nHe'll drop me off.
13	cl1	I'll see you all later, then.
evt/nq/msg_nq120707t.json

9	cl1	Ah, yes.
10	cl1	Let's swap out the\nBuddy Blaster's parts.
11	cl1	I'm really sorry, but could you get me\na Three-fold Transistor and a Bullet\nScreen?
12	H	Can do!
13	H	Come on, Lanz!
14	5	Yessir!
evt/nq/msg_nq120709t.json

10	H	Just a little more work\nand you'll be perfect,\nDorrick.
11	H	You'll be a big, strong, kind\nLevnis to protect everyone.
12	H	Thank you all for your help so far.
13	5	Any time.
14	pa1	Now Dorrick construction\nmove to phase ten!
15	pa1	Only thing left is hard work of\nRepapa and team for final\nadjustment!
16	cl1	I'm quite invested now, dears, so I'd\nlike to stay till the end, if that's all right.

28	H	Hey, Pulipuli.
29	H	You aren't hurt, are you?
30	sa1	Meh?!
31	H	You only wanted to be friends\nwith everyone, didn't you?
32	H	But you can't do it that way.\nSomeone could get hurt.
33	sa1	What Valdi know?
34	sa1	Pulipuli is nobody! That why\nnobody take notice of Pulipuli\nif Pulipuli not work hard!
35	H	*I* took notice.
36	sa1	Meh?
37	H	I mean, your methods were not particularly\ngreat, but you're pretty good with a Levnis.
38	H	You're not a nobody.\nYou're valuable.
39	H	You're just your own worst enemy.
40	sa1	...Meh?
41	sa1	But Pulipuli do only failures.\nValdi not angry?
42	H	I mess things up all the time.
43	H	Look at what happened this time.\nAnd I've broken Mechafriend more\ntimes than I can count.
44	H	But you know, failures always\ncome with an "afterwards".
45	H	I got to build Dorrick.
46	H	I got to make a lot of friends.
47	H	I can do a lot more than I could before,\nthanks to everyone's help.
48	H	That's all connected to\nwhat's happened now.
49	H	Failure teaches you things.
50	H	So I don't want you\nto give up, Pulipuli.
51	sa1	Valdi...
52	H	Let's try again.
53	H	I want to build a world where people\nand Levnises can live in harmony.
54	H	But it'll take a long time\nif I try to do it alone.
55	H	It'd be a lot easier if you'd\nhelp me out. Would you?
56	H	Haha, good.
57	H	There's still plenty more I can do.
58	H	And with the rest of you helping,\nwe can aim even higher!
59	H	OK, first order of business\nis fixing up Mechafriend.
60	H	Time to pick up all those parts, people!

0	2	People go crazy for collecting\nFourtune Clovers in Colony 30\ntoo, don't they?
1	1	You used to collect them\nas well, didn't you, Eunie?
2	3	Yeah. Only got four though.
3	6	Are they lucky because\nthey're so hard to find?
4	3	Bingo.
5	3	I don't know where it came from,\nbut they say if you find seven,\nthey keep death away.
6	4	Based on what?
7	5	Hang on...
8	5	There's not much point in a mechanic\npicking seven of them to ward off death.\nThey're non-combatants.
9	3	Yeah, they're less likely to die in action.\nEh, I don't know if there's anything to it.
10	5	Why is Ven collecting them then?
11	3	Ven from Colony 30?
12	3	Oh, you think there's a good\nFourtune Clover spot somewhere\na mechanic can reach?
13	5	Yeah, I guess that might be what I think.
14	3	Class! What say we go ask around!
15	3	Looks like Eunie's gonna add\nto her collection, hehe!
evt/nq/msg_nq120901t.json
0	3	Oi, you. Little birdy told me\nyou collect Fourtune Clovers.
1	la1	You could say that.
2	la1	It's the colony's pilots... Especially the\nfourth squad. They're just so reckless.
3	la1	Just yesterday someone... (sniff)\nHow many more will we lose before\nI get a full seven...? (sniff)
4	3	So he's collecting\nthem for the pilots...?
5	la1	Are you a collector too?
6	la1	If so, you'll want to go to Laprel Knoll.\nThey're often found around there.
7	3	Sweet, ta!
evt/nq/msg_nq120902f.json
0	3	Oh, this looks like prime\nFourtune Clover country!
1	2	All thanks to Ven, no less.\n...Should we bring him one as thanks?
2	3	Ooh, good shout, love.
3	3	After I've snaffled juuust one\nas commission!
4	6	Oh, I'll help find you\na clover, Eunie!
5	9	Manana also searching!
evt/nq/msg_nq120903t.json
0	3	Hey, Ven! I found Fourtune Clovers\nover at Laprel Knoll!
1	la1	Oh, good news. When work's\ncalmed down I'll go over and\nlook for some.
2	3	Yeah, actually...
3	3	Here's one I picked earlier.\nTo thank you for the heads up\nabout the spot.
4	la1	Are you sure you don't mind?
5	la1	Thanks!
6	la1	That's three, I think... (sniff)
7	la1	May all the Levnises from squad four\ncome back unbroken!
8	3	...
9	3	Was this...not for the pilots?
10	la1	What, those lummoxes? All they're\ngood for is breaking perfectly\ngood Levnises! Incompetents. Ugh.
11	3	Um, right. Got you.
evt/nq/msg_nq130100f.json
0	1	So there's something about the\nColony 4 resource problem that\nI've been thinking about.
1	4	Alexandria, why did you help-?
2	K	That's a bit of a rude question.
3	K	Colony 4's an ally. They've been\nreleased from their Flame Clock.
4	K	I don't need an excuse\nto help an ally, do I?
5	4	Yes, I can understand your sharing resources\nwith them. But what I'm trying to say is-
6	1	How does an Agnian colony know so much\nabout the resource shortages of a Kevesi\none? That's what you were going to say?
7	1	That's what I was wondering too.
8	K	...Haha, there's no\nputting anything past you.
9	K	Information is easy to come by if you\nknow how. And I always stay up to date.
10	3	You're not saying you have\nan inside man, are you?
11	K	I wouldn't take that much of a risk.\nI'm just doing the same as you.
12	K	Here. This is how.
13	4	This is a Collectopaedia Card!
14	K	I told you, didn't I? I came up with them.
15	K	Did you think I could only see\nmy own army's information?
16	3	Wait, but, wait.
17	3	You're saying that you leaked\nsecret Agnus tech to get Keves\nto use it as well...?
18	1	Huh... At the time, I just\nthought we got really lucky.
19	1	When all along it was a ploy\nto dig up enemy intel...?\nI have to say I'm impressed.
20	K	The important part comes after that.
21	K	While analyzing the flow of resources,\nI realized that this war is almost perfectly\nbalanced.
22	K	Almost like it doesn't want to end.
23	K	Which is to say, there's someone\norchestrating the war from behind\nthe scenes.
24	2	"When you think about rules, you have to\nrealize that they are closely entangled with\nthe intentions of whoever set them."
25	2	Your words, Alexandria. This is\nwhat you were talking about, isn't it?
26	3	You worked out that much.\nDidn't exactly try and blow the\nwhistle, did you?
27	K	What else could I do?\nWhat could anybody have done,\neven had they known?
28	4	Then Ouroboros appeared...\nThe world's "enemy".
29	4	And the enemy of one's enemy\nis one's friend. Right?
30	K	I'm glad you understand.
31	5	I hope you're friendly with your\nactions as well as your words.
32	K	Cold as ever. OK, how about this?
33	K	I'll show you the storehouse,\nthe heart of Colony Iota itself.
34	K	Take whatever supplies you\nneed and use them as you will.
35	K	Fair?
36	4	You're saying we have final\nsay over resource distribution?
37	K	Well, you'll have to discuss the particulars\nof storehouse management with Chelle,\nbut yes.
38	2	I appreciate the sentiment,\nbut we wouldn't feel right...
39	K	Whoops, already pinged her!
40	3	Already?!
41	K	She doesn't have much spare time\nso you'd better get hustling.
42	K	The storehouse is a bit hard to give\ndirections to, so first just head for\nTorus Hollow.
43	K	Just talk to Rhyza at the\nentrance and he'll let you in.
evt/nq/msg_nq130101f.json
0	@a1	...
1	6	Is he...mad at us...?
2	K	Rhyza, let's chat.
3	K	You're scaring Sena.
4	@a1	Sorry. Not a talker.
5	6	...Oh! I see.
6	@a1	Beware the monsters.
7	6	M-monsters?!
8	K	The storehouse is a little way out\nfrom here, so a little infestation is\nto be expected.
9	K	It's hard to find, and the monsters save\non guard duties. You could say they're\nthe perfect anti-theft device.
10	@a1	Risky business.
11	6	R-right, I see. We'll be careful!
12	@a1	Ask Chelle.
13	@a1	And Dame Alex...?
14	K	Yes?
15	@a1	Be nice.
16	K	I'm nice! You don't have to tell me!\nDon't bother yourself with me!
17	K	Come on then, let's get moving!
evt/nq/msg_nq130102f.json
0	2	So this is the storehouse.
1	5	Queen's flapping wings...
2	5	All this stuff is yours?
3	_a1	Yep. And we're not at full capacity.
4	K	Let me introduce you. This is Chelle,\nour storehouse manager extraordinaire.
5	K	So, Chelle, everything should\nbe as previously discussed.
6	K	As of now, our friends here are\non resource distribution.
7	_a1	Fine with me. It needs to be done.
8	_a1	And the more surveillance, the better.
9	1	Who's surveilling who?
10	_a1	All of you surveilling me, of course.
11	_a1	When you're living under the Flame Clock,\nyour allies and enemies are clear.
12	_a1	Whoever you can get the fire from\nis your enemy. Simple as that.
13	K	But we can't live by those rules any more.
14	2	Enemies and allies...
15	2	They change depending on you\nyourself. That's the difficulty, isn't it?
16	4	Forcing conflict is just one\neffect of the Flame Clock.
17	4	Couldn't we also say that the Flame\nClocks controlled our behavior?
18	K	That's it.
19	K	The time's ripe for traitors to emerge,\nso it's dangerous for any one person\nto hold too much power.
20	1	Do you doubt your own\ncomrades that much?
21	K	Of course I don't doubt them,\nI know they can get whatever job done.\nWe're all pretty brilliant here.
22	4	So the only thing that counts\nin your eyes is ability?
23	K	Let me ask you, then. Would you trust\nsome researcher sat at their desk all day\nwith some manual labor?
24	K	Would you put a soldier who couldn't\npilot a bathtub in the cockpit of a Levnis?
25	1	...
26	K	Personal skill is what counts in tactics.\nAs long as you believe in that, that's\nenough.
27	K	Does anyone disagree?
28	1	Alexandria, you...
29	_a1	She's a right pain, isn't she?
30	K	Give it a rest, Chelle!
31	_a1	But I think it's a wise assessment.
32	_a1	No one knows how things\nare going to change.
33	_a1	Keep an eye on me or not.\nI'm with Dame Alex. That's all.
34	2	You really care for Alexandria, don't you?
35	_a1	I do. A lot.
36	_a1	But I'm tenth term. Not got much time left.
37	_a1	And Dame Alex needs\nallies more than anything.
38	_a1	Please be good to her.
39	K	You shouldn't talk like that.
40	K	About what time you have left...
41	_a1	I suppose you're right.
42	_a1	Didn't mean to talk for this long.\nAnyway, about Colony 4's resources.
43	_a1	First just got to do this.
44		Supply distribution\nauthorization granted.
45	1	What was that?
46	K	You've got access rights to the goods.
47	K	You could think of it as unlocking a new\nfunction of the Collectopaedia Cards.
48	4	You really packed it\nwith features, didn't you?
49	K	It's nice to see you surprised.
50	4	This isn't surprise, it's shock.
51	_a1	It's pretty user-friendly. Just name the\ncommander of the colony you want to\nsend to.
52	_a1	Then just pick your supplies, and done.
53	5	But Colony 4's commander...
54	_a1	No need to worry.
55	_a1	It's all been arranged with Bolearis,\nthe acting commander. You can use\nhis name in this instance.
56	_a1	It's easier to pick it up by doing,\nto be honest. Give it a go.
evt/nq/msg_nq130103t.json
0	_a1	Yep, everything went through no problem.
1	_a1	You've got authority over about half\nof the resources in this room.
2	_a1	How you divvy it up is absolutely up\nto you. We're trusting you to distribute it\naccording to the common good.
3	5	The common what now?
4	3	To each colony according\nto its need, innit.
5	_a1	If we scratch their back,\nthey'll scratch ours in future.
6	_a1	It's like an investment that'll\npay dividends to us later.
evt/nq/msg_nq130104t.json
0	@a1	Beware the monsters.
1	@a1	It's risky business.
evt/nq/msg_nq130200s.json
0	5	Colony Iota's storehouse is going\nto be in trouble pretty soon.
1	4	Indeed. More people rely on their\nresources than ever, and we're burning\nthrough them rapidly.
2	6	Do you think we've\ngiven out too much?
3	4	I think that even without that, they need to\nstart considering what they'll do the next\ntime a resupply doesn't arrive on schedule.
4	K	You don't have to worry about it.\nI'm the one who asked you to do this.
5	K	And it's not the first time we've\nbeen short on supplies.
6	4	You can't afford to be so glib.
7	4	If it's causing a strain on the colony,\nyou should re-examine your procedures.
8	2	We can help out with some\nshort-term resupply runs.
9	3	It's the least we could do after\nall the taking we've been doing.
10	K	In that case, I'll take\nyou up on your offer.
11	K	As you know, the storehouse is\nChelle's domain. Let's talk to her first.
12	K	She's probably already got some\nideas, and if you work together\nyou can be more efficient.
13	2	I think it would be worth\ndiscussing with Alexandria.
14	2	We could offer to help out with\nsome short-term resupply runs.
15	6	Oh, that's a great idea!
16	3	All we've done so far is take, take, take,\nso it's really the least we could do.
17	1	Yeah...
18	1	They've probably already got measures\nin place for this, anyway. We should\nwork with the colony.
19	2	In that case, let's go meet with Alexandria\nas soon as we get the chance.
evt/nq/msg_nq130201f.json
0	jb1	...So it's going to take\nsome time till it arrives.
1	_a1	I thought it might. We'll just have to\nstretch the shortfall out through rationing.
2	_a1	So, that-
3	3	If you're low on supplies\nwe can help.
4	6	If we all work together,\nwe'll get it done in no time!
5	_a1	All of you...
6	K	They're concerned that we've grown too\naccustomed to throwing supplies around.
7	K	This friendly young man wants\nto do anything he can to help.
8	4	Don't misrepresent me. I just\nwant to improve the efficiency of-
9	K	Once you saw improvement was\nneeded, you wanted to help. Yes?
10	4	I...well. I suppose, but...
11	K	Then we agree.
12	K	Such a kind person. I can tell you're\nthe sort of person who takes on a lot.\nAlways shouldering the burdens of others.
13	4	...Please stop.
14	4	This is something you're already prepared\nfor, though, isn't it? Could you bring us up\nto speed on the situation?
15	_a1	OK, I get what's going on.
16	1	We talked to Alexandria about it,\nand she told us to ask you.
17	4	This is something you're already prepared\nfor, though, isn't it? Could you bring us up\nto speed on the situation?
18	_a1	OK, I get what's going on.
19	_a1	As you've seen, we're sending out the best\nof the best from mine and Rhyza's squads.
20	_a1	And if they come back, they're expected\nto bring in a good haul. In fact, I'm\nprojecting we'll be up to 70% capacity.
21	5	70%?! Not bad!
22	3	You said "if" they come back.
23	3	So all of these big plans are\nreally just optimism, aren't they?
24	_a1	Ha, very perceptive.
25	jb1	Two of the units sent on the\nmission have got a bit stuck.
26	jb1	They seem to have encountered\na colony of Scorpoxes.
27	3	Scorpoxes? You think they're migrating?
28	jb1	Given our info on their numbers\nand range, I'd say you're right.
29	4	A suboptimal situation.
30	5	Can someone explain\nthis migration thing?
31	4	The monsters go on a big journey.
32	4	If the monster population increases for\nwhatever reason, then they'll go roaming\nin search of new feeding grounds.
33	3	And if you bump into them,\nthey'll be on you like that.
34	3	They're all so starving that to them\nyou're just a big walking meatball.
35	5	...Hurk...
36	1	Let me guess - the units that were\nattacked were carrying...
37	_a1	Food. Yep. The smell\nmust have attracted them.
38	2	How can you be so calm about this?\nIf you don't get help to them soon-
39	_a1	No plan ever survives\ncontact with the enemy.
40	_a1	So I want them to get\nthemselves out of this.
41	_a1	This experience will be valuable\nfor them as individuals.
42	4	You're of the opinion that too much\nhelp will rob them of their capacity for\npersonal growth?
43	_a1	I am.
44	2	Well, it would still be worthwhile to keep\nan eye on the situation without helping\ntoo much, wouldn't it?
45	2	If you weren't even a little worried, you\nwouldn't have told us what was going on.
46	_a1	...Well, I don't know how to answer that.
47	2	I think I understand.
48	2	I know how you feel, and what\nyou want your legacy to be.
49	_a1	...
50	_a1	Cozalie's unit is stuck in Dannagh Desert,\nand Thorbin's is in Ribbi Flats.
51	_a1	They'll be pretty laden down, so you'll\nknow them when you see them.
52	1	OK. We'll check on them\nwithout coddling them.
53	6	And we'll keep everyone\nsafe! And the supplies too!
54	_a1	You're doing me a huge favor.
evt/nq/msg_nq130202f.json
0	kb1	They just won't quit!
1	lb1	We could use the supplies as a distraction!
2	kb1	No can do! That's our\nabsolute last resort!
3	ab1	Give me three minutes! Then-
4	ab1	Ah!
5	ab1	Huh? Are you...?
6	2	There are quite a lot of them...
7	1	Should we buy you some time?
8	ab1	Please do!
evt/nq/msg_nq130203f.json
0	ab1	Everything's working as normal.
1	5	Repairs all done?
2	ab1	Yep! Thanks for the help!
3	ab1	We're going to be a little delayed,\nbut we'll get back to the colony.
4	6	But there are still Scorpoxes...
5	kb1	Not to worry! We're\ntaking a different route.
6	lb1	Our plan is to take a path that another\nunit's already confirmed as clear.
7	5	You're so...chirpy about it.
8	2	Does this happen often?
9	kb1	Well, it's the first time I've run into\na monster migration. But there's\nalways something popping up.
10	lb1	You get used to it after a while.
11	ab1	You've got to be especially calm\nin command when things aren't\ngoing according to plan.
12	ab1	We've been looking to Chelle\nfor that all this time.
13	ab1	And I just thought that this\ntime we have to fill that role.
14	K	Cozalie's next in line\nfor Chelle's position.
15	K	It won't be too long before Chelle's\nunit is under Cozalie's command.
16	ab1	Haha, it's all still up in the air, though...
17	ab1	I'll prove myself enough to\nbe worthy of a promotion!
18	kb1	That's why we got this mission,\nand why we had to get supplies\nthat attract so much attention.
19	kb1	Cozalie's tapped to take over from\nChelle when the time comes.
20	kb1	That's why we got this mission,\nand why we had to get supplies\nthat attract so much attention.
21	lb1	There's a little bit of not wanting\nto be overtaken by Thorbin too...
22	ab1	What are you talking about?\nIt's nothing to do with him!
23	2	I'm sure Chelle knows\nhow you really feel.
24	2	Keep up the good work.
25	ab1	Will do! And thanks!
evt/nq/msg_nq130204t.json
0	4	Hello, yes, excuse me, is this\nThorbin's unit of Colony Iota?
1	Zb1	Verily, I declare it so. And\nas for Thorbin, why, I am he.
2	2	We heard you'd been attacked by\nScorpoxes, so we just came to see\nhow you were doing.
3	Zb1	The enemy has been soundly\ndefeated, as you can see. Alas,\nhowever, as you can also see...
4	Zb1	Our very important Levnis has sustained\na battering most baleful and brutal.
5	4	It's not in the best shape...but repairs\nshould be possible, shouldn't they?
6	Zb1	Would that it were so simple! With the\nnecessary parts, all things are possible!\nAlack, I find myself bereft of spares.
7	Zb1	That the heir to Rhyza's noble company\nshould find himself in such a pickle...\nIt's enough to get a chap quite down.
8	2	So that's how you got stranded here?
9	2	We can help you get\nthe parts you need.
10	Zb1	Would you deign to do such a deed?
11	4	You have casualties here. It'll\nbe more efficient for us to go.
12	Zb1	I shall be forever in your debt!
13	Zb1	To be frank, merely safeguarding the\nprecious supplies sapped us of our energy.
14	Zb1	If only we had a mere five Trippleg Joints,\nit would be enough to serve as our\nsalvation.
15	Zb1	Could I trouble you for ten of\nyour finest Trippleg Joints?
16	Zb1	I apologize for the\nexcessive amount.
17	Zb1	For my part, I shall endeavor to defend\nmy compatriots and the supplies.
18	2	We'll be back as\nsoon as we can.
evt/nq/msg_nq130205t.json
0	Zb1	Lo! With this, we shall certainly\nbe able to repair the Levnis!
1	Zb1	How can I ever repay you\nfor this noble deed?
2	2	That's not necessary. Actually,\nwe should be the ones thanking you.
3	2	We're actually the ones who\nused up the colony's resources\nin the first place.
4	Zb1	Why, a trifle! Nothing to bestir\nyourselves over, I'm sure!
5	Zb1	We gain far, far more than we\ncould ever lose by extending the\ngentle hand of aid to others.
6	Zb1	Think on it! Even this mission in\nitself provides invaluable training.
7	Zb1	And it teaches us to respect our\nlimited resources, and never to\ntake them for granted.
8	Zb1	But above all of these vital and priceless\nthings, it has afforded me the chance to\nbecome acquainted with all of you.
9	Zb1	This brings me great personal joy.
10	2	...I see.
11	Zb1	This is not limited to me. We, all of us,\nare habituated to this mode of life.\nThis knowledge is ingrained in us.
12	Zb1	I beg of you, use our supplies in whichever\nway you see fit, without restraint!
13	4	I thought Alexandria was employing these\nresource-sharing tactics to make allies.
14	4	But is she also using it to train\nthe newer recruits? Just how\nfar ahead is she planning?
evt/nq/msg_nq130206f.json

2	_a1	Yeah. thanks for that.

4	db1	Do you have a minute? I just wanted to\nchat about expanding the research labs...
5	K	Always in a hurry, aren't you?
6	K	Sorry, just got to step out for a bit.
7	K	Thanks for today, though.\nEverything was restocked\neven quicker than planned.
8	K	Which is a very nice\nchange from the usual.
9	1	I'm just happy we\nwere able to help.
10	_a1	Nice to see you back. I heard all about\nyour exploits from the returning units.
11	2	It was just like you said, Chelle. Everyone\nwas thinking hard about how to live up to\ntheir responsibilities.
12	2	I think I understand why Colony\nIota's such a major player now.
13	_a1	You finally appreciate\nhow great Dame Alex is?
14	4	...Just one thing. What exactly is\nAlexandria hoping to accomplish?
15	4	Securing allies through resource sharing\nand simultaneously training the newer\nsoldiers. They are closely linked goals.
16	_a1	Dame Alex...doesn't like\nto repeat bad experiences.
17	_a1	When Colony Iota was hoarding its\nresources, we had a big problem with\ninternal conflicts.
18	_a1	The rich only want to get richer.\nThere was no mutual aid, no cooperation.\nJust bad faith and selfishness.
19	_a1	Dame Alex knew that wealth in\nresources doesn't necessarily\ntranslate to quality of life.
20	2	I see...
21	4	...But is that the only reason?
22	4	I'm a pretty skeptical person myself,\nbut Alexandria is strangely cold at times.
23	4	Has she always been like that?
24	_a1	...
25	_a1	...Dame Alex still doesn't believe in\nherself. She can't bring herself to.
26	_a1	We've only been able to watch\nover her. But you...
27	2	...But we what?
28	_a1	Dame Alex has to change.
29	_a1	That's all I can say for now.\nPlease just keep watch over her.
30	4	...I understand. We will.
31	_a1	Anyway. That was a bit of a tangent.
32	_a1	We managed to get to 70% capacity,\njust as planned, so you can get back\nto work as before!
33	_a1	I can't thank you enough\nfor helping out our people.

0	_a1	Cozalie's unit is stuck in Dannagh Desert,\nand Thorbin's is in Ribbi Flats.
1	_a1	Would you be able to check on\nthe situation without lending too\nmuch of a hand?
2	_a1	I heard back from Cozalie.\nThanks to your quick thinking\nthey completed the mission safely.
3	_a1	They looked like they'd put away some\ngood experience as well, thanks to you.
4	_a1	Now, about Thorbin's unit... They still\nremain stuck in Ribbi Flats.
5	_a1	It's been a little while now since I last\nheard from them, which is a bit worrying.
6	_a1	Thorbin got in touch to say that his team\nmade it out thanks to you.
7	_a1	They were really keen to learn from you.\nInspired, even, by your indomitable spirit.
8	_a1	By the looks of things, he'll make a good\nsuccessor to Rhyza. The future's bright!
9	_a1	Now, about Cozalie's unit... They still\nremain stuck in Dannagh Desert.
10	_a1	It's been a little while now since I last\nheard from them, which is a bit worrying.

0	K	So many visitors! This isn't\nsomething I see every day.
1	1	We were wondering\nif you weren't lonely.
2	K	And what do you\nreally mean by that?
3	K	Something difficult, no doubt.
4	2	It's about the storehouse.
5	2	It's hard to keep it stocked, isn't it?\nWe wondered if there was anything\nwe could do to help.
6	K	Ah, I see. Well, I appreciate the sentiment,\nbut our own soldiers are fine...
7	K	...Hm. No. Actually, would you mind\ntalking to Chelle about this?
8	K	It'd be much appreciated.\nI can't really leave here, you see.
9	1	You sound pretty tied up.\nHas something happened?
10	K	Nothing more than usual. We're\ndiscussing the future direction of\nthe colony, that's all.
11	K	There's a lot of opinions and suggestions\nflying around at the moment. Are you\nsurprised at how busy we are?
12	2	Everyone's really serious,\nbut in quite an exciting way.
13	K	Everyone's in high spirits. This is a good\nopportunity to get things done, you see.
14	1	Looks like you're enjoying\nyourself too, Alexandria.
15	K	Well, isn't it exciting\nto try out new things?
16	K	Anyway, I won't be able to\ngo along with you, I'm afraid.
17	K	I really appreciate anything you can\ndo about the storehouse situation!

0	6	Uhh... What kind of experiments is this\nperson wanting to do on us, exactly?
1	5	What, are you scared?
2	6	Well, but what if they catch us?\nWhat would they do?!
3	5	Then don't get caught?\nYou know who the enemy is.
4	2	The researcher was called\nSalazar, wasn't she?
5	2	According to Caspar, she seems to spend\nmost of her time at the research lab,\nclose by the northern gate.
6	4	If the rumors are anything to\ngo by, nothing good will come\nof associating with her.
7	4	I suggest we adopt a policy\nof active avoidance.
8	1	Makes sense. I'd rather not\nend up a test subject either.
9	1	Let's do what we can to stay\nfar away from Colony Iota's\nnorthern gate.
evt/nq/msg_nq130301f.json
0	5	Er, what's that?
1	3	What the spark?!
2	4	Cover your mouth and nose!\nThis is-
3	4	...knockout...gas...
4	1	Urgh...
5	1	Where am I?
6	106cb10	Experiments! Explosions!\nExpanding our understanding\nof the natural world!
7	104cb10	It's everyone's best pal, Salazar!
8	10300	Salazar, the Colony Iota researcher?
9	104cb10	Queen's fluffy tufts,\nso you've heard of me!
10	20300	What have you done to us?
11	204cb10	Nothing! ...Yet.
12	50300	Liar! Then how did we end up here, huh?
13	504cb10	Meep... I'm not lying!
14	504cb10	I'm just curious! I just want\nto know about Ouroboros!\nAfter all, you are-
15	50300	Yeah, not doing this.\nTime to get out of here.
16	504cb10	Meep! Don't disconnect!
17	504cb10	Don't you want to be able to\nsend stuff to your friends?!
18	50300	What's she on about, stuff?
19	10300	Wait...
20		Supply distribution\nauthorization suspended.
21	10300	...Too late.
22	50300	Hey! Pack it in! Don't snuff around!
23	504cb10	I'm not snuffing around?\nI just froze your permissions.
24	504cb10	Just come along to Namba Mound, and I'll\nkindly unfreeze them for you, honest.
25	508cb10	I want you to come and say hello!\nI'll be waiting to see you.

0	cb1	Experiments! Explosions!\nExpeditious exposition!
1	cb1	I'm so pleased you all\nmade it, Ouroboros!
2	5	Yeah, good for us. Now give back\nour authorization and we'll say\nno more about it.
3	cb1	Oh, I don't care what you\nhave to say about it.
4	cb1	Be a sweetie and help me with\nan experiment, would you?
5	5	What?!
6	4	Don't bother, Lanz.\nYou won't get through to her.
7	5	Looks that way.
8	5	Makes it easier to give her a good\nwalloping without feeling bad about it.
evt/nq/msg_nq130303f.json
0	cb1	(sob) I thought that was it for me...
1	cb1	But...
2	cb1	OH MY QUEEN, would you look at\nthis fabulous data!
3	5	There's nothing fabulous about it!\nYou've ruined our entire day!
4	cb1	Oh, but it was worth it! I've never\nseen such high-energy reactions!
5	cb1	And that transformation!
6	cb1	Not even a full Flame Clock\nunleashes energy like that. It's\na scientific marvel, is what it is!
7	cb1	There's no getting away from it!\nOuroboros are walking ether channels!
8	bb1	And yet despite that...
9	bb1	This is not how we work.
10	cb1	Caspar?! What are you doing here?
11	bb1	Since you left with a Levnis, it wasn't\nhard to guess what you were up to.
12	bb1	Are you sure you want to disappoint\nRhyza? He'll throw you in the river again.
13	cb1	It doesn't matter, I had to do it.
14	cb1	My results speak for themselves.\nThe subjects are composed of\nunknown energy!
15	cb1	If we can find a way to harness\nthis energy efficiently, we can\nrevolutionize the way we live.
16	cb1	I want to bring hope to all of us.\nAnd I want to do it during my lifetime!
17	K	I do respect your commitment\nto your research.
18	K	But you can't hurt people in your\npower and expect hope, that's just\nyour superiority complex talking.
19	K	Now reinstate their authorization.
20	bb1	You can't exploit someone and call it hope.
21	bb1	Now give back what you took.
22	cb1	Meep...
23		Supply distribution\nauthorization restored.
24	1	Looks like everything's as it was.
25	2	Are you doing this research\nto help everyone?
26	cb1	Mhm...
27	cb1	Sorry if I hurt you...
28	2	That's OK. I understand.
29	5	...Can't believe this.
30	5	You'd better be thankful to Mio here.
31	cb1	I am! I am! Go on, have this!
32	cb1	There you go!
33	1	This is pretty valuable...\nCan we really have it?
34	cb1	Yeah, course! I'm not\ngoing to use it, am I?
35	cb1	So you should use it, and\nreport back on its effects, OK?
36	5	Is this...another experiment?
37	6	Y-you aren't even sorry, are you?
38	bb1	Sorry. She's a bit of a one-trick Ponio\nwhen it comes to research.
39	cb1	I'm going to research some research\nmethods that won't make everyone so\nangry with me.
40	cb1	Thanks in advance for your cooperation!

0	bb1	I don't suppose you've seen Salazar\naround anywhere, have you?
1	bb1	She's a bit weird, talks a bit funny?
2	3	Doesn't ring a bell.
3	1	Has something happened to her?
4	bb1	She's kind of...after you.
5	3	...Sorry, no, sorry. Explain.
6	bb1	Right, let me start from the beginning.
7	bb1	The colony's set up a research\nteam to look into energy.
8	bb1	One of the researchers is Salazar, who's\nbecome aware of your particular power.
9	bb1	She's talking about building some\nkind of Ouroboros cylinder, to get\nthat energy into usable form.
10	3	Sounds useful.
11	1	...And it sounds like she's decided\nwe'll make good test subjects.
12	3	...Sounds dangerous.
13	bb1	It does seem quite dangerous. Yeah.
14	bb1	She's not a bad person, she's just...very\npushy when it comes to this sort of thing.
15	bb1	My advice to you is to give the research\nlab a wide berth, just to be safe.
16	1	Thanks for the warning.\nWe'll keep it in mind.
evt/nq/msg_nq130400f.json
0	6	Um, sorry if I've got this wrong...
1	6	But everyone in Colony Iota's talking\nabout your birthday, Alexandria...
2	K	Oh, it's not my real birthday, of course.
3	5	Oh yeah, "of course".\n'Cause that'd actually make sense!
4	K	We wouldn't want the commander's\nHomecoming date to become common\nknowledge now, would we?
5	3	Yeah, don't want to show weakness.\nI get you, I do. But...
6	3	Birthdays, Alex! Birthdays are just special.\nKeeping your own actual birthday secret?\nThat's pretty tragic.
7	K	You think I'm tragic?
8	3	I mean, this is just what the\nColony Iota lads are saying...
9	K	Haha, I'll let you have that one.
10	3	It's tragic if we can't\ncelebrate with you, yeah.
11	K	...What a nice thing to say, Eunie.
12	4	But your exact age being kept a mystery\nbrings problems of its own.
13	4	Because now there are people who\nwonder if this year is your final term\nbefore Homecoming.
14	K	You're right. There are. And things\nhave changed in the meantime...
15	1	Well, this is just my opinion.
16	1	But I think it's a bit harsh to make people\nwho care about you have to worry every\nyear that it's going to be your last.
17	K	People who care about me?\nI suppose so.
18	1	That's what I'd think if I wasn't\nfamiliar with the situation.
19	1	I'd fear that I might not be able to\nspend more time with you...
20	K	...Oh.
21	1	Hm?
22	K	Yes... I see. If I were to depart on\na crucial mission, never to return,\nthat would be...less than ideal.
23	K	That would actually be...quite scary?!
24	K	OK, OK, Alex, calm down.
25	K	...I need to talk to Chickadee about this.
26	1	I understand.
27	K	...
28	K	...Huh.
29	K	...Strange, I can't get a connection.
30	3	Maybe she's busy?
31	K	...That's probably it.\nFirst time, though.
32	4	You could try to visit her in person?
33	K	Not going to work, I'm afraid.\nI'm traveling with you.
34	1	It's fine - we'll just go together, then.\nWhereabouts in the colony is she\nlikely to be?
35	2	We'd better find her as soon as\npossible. Everyone will be enjoying\nthe celebration.
36	K	You really are very kind-hearted\npeople, aren't you?
37	K	All right, then. If you don't mind\naccompanying me until we find\nChickadee, you're very welcome.

4	@a1	...Sorry. No.
5	K	That's OK, we'll just keep looking.

3	K	Again?! No, no, nothing like that!
4	_a1	Heheh, sorry. Couldn't resist.\nYou just spend so much time with her.
5	_a1	I'm a bit jealous, that's all.
6	K	Honestly...
7	_a1	Anyway, should we send\nout a search party?
8	K	No, that won't be necessary.\nIt would just cause her needless worry.
9	_a1	Still, not good optics for the\nlieutenant to be AWOL, is it?
10	K	Your claws are well and\ntruly out today, Chelle.
11	_a1	You think? Then I guess you'd\nbetter pay me a bit more attention.
12	_a1	...If I hear from her\nI'll send you word, OK?

0	Wb1	No idea where your\nlittle favorite is, I'm afraid.
1	K	What a way to talk! And after\nI've come specially to see you.
2	Wb1	I never asked you to, Dame Alex.
3	K	And here I thought we were friends...\nYou're so cruel.
4	Wb1	Are you pulling my leg?
5	K	Of course I am. I treasure\nour little chats, Sequoia.
6	Wb1	...OK. Because we're term-mates,\nI'll tell you this.
7	Wb1	I'm the only one who can put up\nwith your attitude problem. So you'd\nbetter appreciate me.
8	K	Sequoia, are you actually jealous?\nIs that why you're so cruel to Chickadee?
9	Wb1	Ha, what? No, I just don't suffer fools.
10	Wb1	Still, let me know when you do find her.\nNow trot on, you're cluttering up the place.
11	K	I'll come back to spend some\nquality time with you soon!

evt/nq/msg_nq130404s.json
0	5	Where's Chickadee flown off to, then?\nHas she gone out somewhere?
1	2	Somebody saw her leaving Colony Iota\nby the northern gate, right?
2	4	There's nothing there, except warehouses.\nAnd nobody there has seen her...
3	1	Well, in that case... What's further beyond?
4	K	...Yunnae's Rise?
5	K	Oh, I wonder...
6	4	Do you have an idea?
7	K	I think so. Anyway, you've\nbeen a great help to me.
8	5	Oh, let me guess.
9	5	Don't tell me - now you're going to\ntoddle off on some secret errand on\nyour own, yeah?
10	K	I don't have any confirmation I'm right.\nI can't drag you along in good faith.
11	5	You're really saying this? Now?
12	5	This is about the worst sparkin'\ntime to go off on your own!
13	4	Lanz has the right of it. Why is it so\nimportant that you do this alone?
14	K	This is my business.
15	1	I think at this point\nit's all of our business.
16	K	...Hm!
17	4	Your decisiveness is one of your strong\npoints, but your unwillingness to accept\nhelp is a distinct flaw.
18	K	...I can't argue with that.
19	4	You're obviously in a hurry, so why\nnot just tell us what you know?
20	K	...
21	K	There's a rare flower that grows there.\nChickadee will have gone to pick it.
22	6	What kind of flower?
23	3	Ohhh, is this for your birthday?
24	K	I assume so.
25	K	When we first came across it, she...\nShe asked me not to tell anyone.
26	K	She found meaning in keeping it secret.\nSaid it was like her good-luck charm.
27	2	Which is why she's gone alone.
28	6	Oh no, I'm sorry. We made you\nspill the beans on that one...
29	K	Don't worry about it. It's an easy\nexchange for Chickadee's well-being.
30	K	And I couldn't assess\nthe situation impartially.
31	K	As Taion says, I've never been\ngood at relying on others.
32	5	That's something though,\nif you're aware of it.
33	5	The old you wouldn't have picked up\non something like that, I reckon.
34	K	Lanz...
35	5	So yeah, just take it one step at a time.
36	K	I will. Thank you.
37	4	Yunnae's Rise, though...
38	4	The monsters there aren't so strong,\nbut they're threatening enough to pose\na problem to Chickadee.
39	3	Right. Let's get her found.

1	K	I've been looking for you!\nYou had me worried!
2	Yb1	Oh, you brought everyone...?
3	1	I'm sorry, we didn't know\nit was supposed to be a secret...
4	Yb1	Oh, no, it's OK! I'm not angry.\nI'm actually quite pleased!
5	Yb1	I was going to give you this.
6	4	White Millica, I see.\nYes, that is rare in this region.
7	3	Oh, hang on, this is one of them flowers\nwith a meaning, innit? And it means...
8	Yb1	It stands for revealing secrets.
9	Yb1	I only learned it later, but it's\nbecause of how subtly they bloom,\nlike they're all furtive and shy.
10	Yb1	You can be pretty stubborn,\nDame Alex, so I thought the\nflower might give you a push.
11	K	What's this all about...?
12	Yb1	You need to talk to the\ncaptains. Properly.
13	K	But I'm always talking to the\ncaptains. Why, just today-
14	Yb1	Yes, but did you\nreally talk to them?
15	Yb1	Just because I know you never\ntalk about your actual feelings.
16	Yb1	I worry about you.
17	K	...
18	Yb1	I know it's important to keep\nsome information confidential\nfor tactical reasons and all that.
19	Yb1	But even so, I... I don't want the captains\nto go to their ends with regrets.
20	K	Silly girl. You put yourself in\nthis much danger for that?
21	Yb1	You'd never have taken it\nseriously otherwise.
22	Yb1	Anyway, I'm the only person in\nAionios who can tell you off.
23	Yb1	That's an important part\nof the lieutenant's job!
24	K	You're right.
25	K	The reason I came running here without\nthinking twice is because you're always\nlooking out for me.
26	K	I find that you're constantly saving me.
27	Yb1	What are you trying to say here...?
28	K	Well, Chickadee, the thing is...
29	K	I've been thinking that I'd like you\nto take over as commander.
30	Yb1	...Me?!
31	Yb1	What are you saying?!\nI can't, look at the state of-
32	K	Don't pretend you aren't up to the job.\nWhy do you think I made you lieutenant?
33	K	Listen. We need to build bridges.\nTo search for a way to coexist with\nothers in harmony.
34	K	Colony Iota needs someone with\ncompassion, and a lot of heart.
35	4	So you say, but you're equally as vital\nan asset to the colony, are you not?
36	3	Yeah, you've got your goals all\nlaid out. Why can't you be the one\nhelming this new vision of yours?
37	K	Warped methods yield warped\nresults. Anyone who's ever seen\nMoebius knows that.
38	K	You have to straighten it out\nright at the start, or it all comes\ntumbling down...
39	Yb1	And Moebius are the warped things?
40	K	...Yes, exactly.
41	Yb1	...
42	K	This is something that's going to become\nmore of an issue in future, I think. I hope\nyou remember this talk then.
43	Yb1	I...I will. But why talk about\nall this now?
44	K	Because you gave me the push I needed.\nYou wanted me to open up, didn't you?
45	Yb1	Yes...I suppose.
46	K	Do you want to hear what I've\nbeen hiding from you all this time?
47	Yb1	Wait, you're saying that you...?\nTo the old commander...?!
48	K	Have I disappointed you?
49	Yb1	No... No, I finally understand.
50	Yb1	That's why you were so particular about\nyour captains. They all know, don't they?
51	K	I was just being careful.
52	K	Warped methods yield warped\nresults. Anyone who's ever seen\nMoebius knows that.
53	Yb1	It's not warped. You're not warped,\nDame Alex, and the captains aren't either.
54	Yb1	You took on a terrible burden for the\ngreater good. I think that makes you\nstrong. It makes you worthy of respect.
55	K	Chickadee...
56	Yb1	I became a lieutenant so you\nwouldn't have to be alone on\nthe journey through life.
57	Yb1	You always put everyone else\nahead of you. I want to be at\nyour side, support you.
58	Yb1	And I still want that! Forever!
59	4	Don't you feel blessed, Commander,\nto inspire such feelings?
60	K	...I do.
61	K	Trust and betrayal are two sides\nof one coin. And that risk can never\ntruly be eliminated, but...
62	K	If I have to suffer anyway, I'd\nrather it be by Chickadee's side.
63	Yb1	That's how I feel!
64	K	...Now, about my birthday...
65	Yb1	Oh, I'll take care of all that!\nI'm taking requests!
66	K	Ah, good. In that case, please issue\nan official proclamation, announcing\nthat I am in my sixth term.
67	3	...Eh?
68	Yb1	Er...
69	K	And I'll have to tell you the real date.
70	Yb1	Whaaaat?!
71	1	Are you sure? You've\nalways kept it so secret...
72	K	Aren't you the one who disapproved?
73	K	You said it was cruel to make\npeople worry about my Homecoming\nevery birthday.
74	1	Did I really put it like that?
75	K	Haha... We're changing how we live.\nThat means we have to change all our\nold strategies, too.
76	4	...You're terrifyingly decisive.
77	K	Aren't I? I'll take that as\na compliment, thank you.
78	Yb1	Well, this is all fine by me...\nI just have one thing to say.
79	Yb1	Happy birthday, Dame Alex!
80	K	Thank you, Chickadee.
evt/nq/msg_nq130407t.json
0	1	Sorry, do you have any idea where\nwe might find Chickadee?
1	ub1	Chickadee? Yeah, I saw her\nleaving by the north gate.
2	ub1	Not sure what for though,\nso don't grill me on the particulars.
evt/nq/msg_nq130500s.json
0	6	Everyone's going on about\nCollectopaedia Cards, aren't they?
1	K	They're an absolute hit, as you can see.\nI could shed a little tear, I'm so moved.
2	K	It's still possible to game the system\nby choking off the supply and making\na monopoly of it.
3	K	More and more swindlers have started\nto do just that. Sequoia and I are trying\nto work out how to keep them in check.
4	1	Are you getting anywhere with that?
5	K	Not particularly. No matter how\nthorough we are, we can't predict\nevery possible move they'll make.
6	K	And even if we could, there'd be\na limit to what we could do.
7	3	Not even Colony Iota can\nkeep an eye on all of Aionios.
8	1	I can't imagine Sequoia's happy about it.
9	K	Correct. It's been mentally taxing to say\nthe least, and still there's no end in sight...
10	2	But you're not just turning\na blind eye to it, right?
11	2	You're working hard to change\nthings, even if it's difficult.
12	K	Oh, don't think such noble things of me.\nI'd just rather not live in a world where\nsuch unorthodox measures can flourish.
13	5	See, that right there is why Sequoia\nsticks around with you.
14	6	And so will we!
15	4	Let's get to the point.\nWhat can we help you with?
16	K	...You really...?
17	1	Alexandria...? Are you...crying?
18	K	No! Dust! Dust in my eye!
19	K	I'll look into the matter immediately.\nLet's go and visit Sequoia.
evt/nq/msg_nq130501f.json
0	Wb1	...What now?
1	3	Someone's in a huff...
2	Wb1	If you're here to mess around\nthen spare me. I'm busy.
3	K	You wound me!
4	K	We've come to help you, actually.\nDidn't you want someone to do\nsome on-site inspections?
5	Wb1	...
6	Wb1	...Next time lead with that.
7	Wb1	We have one problem.\nRowland of Colony Tau.
8	Wb1	He's suddenly made a habit of going out\nto collect Levnis parts. Often. And they're\nrunning a surplus.
9	K	What's his usual inclination?
10	Wb1	Nothing but food provisions!\nFancies himself a bit of a gourmet.
11	Wb1	So to suddenly turn around and start\ncollecting huge amounts of these parts...\nThat's fishy. No doubt about it.
12	K	The question is, is Rowland doing it to\ninflate prices, or to prepare for battle?
13	3	Hang on, someone's clearly got their\nwires crossed. No way would Colony Tau\nbe involved in shady business like that!
14	K	Well, let's verify it at the source.
15	K	I suspect the flow of goods isn't\nthe only thing that's changing.
16	3	You know you can't just be looking\nat this from the surface level, yeah?
17	K	I know. There must be a deeper cause.\nI wonder what could effect such an\nimmediate and thorough change...
18	Wb1	Be careful, Dame Alex.
19	K	Just "Alex" is fine, as I've told you before.
20	K	I'll be sure to deliver a good report.
21	Wb1	Looking forward to reading it.
22	Wb1	What could cause such a weird change?\nI suppose she's well-placed to find out,\nthe weirdo.
23	Wb1	...Better keep that to myself.
evt/nq/msg_nq130502f.json
0	4	Rowland, can we talk?
1	4	You've recently been asking for\nLevnis parts on the Collectopaedia...
2	cd1	Oh, yeah! Do you want some?
3	K	Would you consider handing them over?
4	cd1	Hahaha! Sorry, can't right now.
5	cd1	Colony 30's mechanics are\npretty desperate for them.
6	cd1	As soon as they're collected,\nthey get used right up.
7	4	Colony 30? So that's why\nyou were collecting parts?
8	cd1	Yeah, they seemed like they were\nhaving problems, so I thought I'd\ngive them a hand.
9	K	Oh!
10	K	I see.
11	cd1	Er, have I done something wrong?
12	4	Not at all. Don't worry.\nThank you for the chat.
13	K	Taion, I have a proposal.
14	K	Would you help Zooza in Colony 30\nwith her Collectopaedia?
15	K	Would you help Fla'ran in Colony 4\nwith her Collectopaedia?
16	4	I can do that, certainly...\nBut would you care to tell me why?
17	K	I want to check something.
18	K	If I'm right, something quite\ninteresting is going on... Let's discuss\nat the canteen there once you're done.
evt/nq/msg_nq130503f.json
0	K	Just as I thought.
1	K	The Scarlet Lychee Zooza was looking\nfor happens to be Fili's favorite.
2	6	Fili's the captain who left\nColony Iota, isn't he?
3	K	Yes. It's hardly what you'd call a balanced\ndiet, but it's all he'd ever eat.
4	K	I'm sure he's getting along\njust fine in Colony 30.
5	K	Fla'ran was looking for something\nshe could use to chase Fili away.
6	6	Fili's the captain who left\nColony Iota, isn't he?
7	K	That's right. Fla'ran's normally quite\neasygoing, but for some reason she\njust can't tolerate the man.
8	K	She'd get incredibly awkward around\nhim. We used to keep Sequoia in the\nroom on standby.
9	2	Was it that bad...?
10	1	So you think Fla'ran's trying to\nprotect her friends from him...?
11	K	Haha... Seems the likeliest situation.
12	3	You look chuffed with yourself.
13	K	To be brutally honest, I only came\nup with Collectopaedia Cards with\nmy own benefit in mind.
14	K	All I wanted was to keep an eye on\nenemy movements and resource flows to\nturn the tide of the war in my favor.
15	K	The cards were nothing but pure\nself-indulgence on my part.
16	1	And now...?
17	K	Now... Well, the results speak for\nthemselves, don't you think? Look\nat all the people they benefit.
18	K	They've blossomed into something far\ngreater than their creator's design...
19	K06Wb10	Calling Alexandria and Ouroboros.
20	K04Wb10	Do you copy? Please respond.
21	3	Is that Sequoia?
22	K0300	Hopefully good news, by the sounds of it.
23	K04Wb10	Well. We've got a little event\non our hands is all I'll say.
24	K04Wb10	We're a little short-handed.\nCould you head to Colony Iota\nBase Entrance?
25	K0700	Understood.
26	3	Sounds like something's happened\nback at the colony.
27	2	We'd better hurry.
evt/nq/msg_nq130504f.json
0	K	Well, this is quite the present.
1	K	To whom do we owe\nour gratitude?
2	Yb1	No idea. It just dropped\nright from the sky.
3	Yb1	We're currently verifying the contents.
4	Yb1	All hands, intercept formation, now!
5	K	That won't be necessary.
6	K	We'll handle this.
evt/nq/msg_nq130505f.json
0	H	Wait wait wait!
1	H	Phew! Just in the nick of time...
2	K	Valdi, what are you-?
3	H	I'm here to see you!
4	H	I'd just perfected Cyberchum, y'see,\nand I wanted you to be the first one\nto see him in all his glory.
5	K	Who's Cyberchum?
6	K	Oh, you mean this Levnis?
7	H	Yeah, I revamped the design a bit!\nGambert lent me a hand with it too.
8	H	Thought it might come in handy if\nyou're ever in a jam, Alexandria!
9	K	Mmm...yes...
10	K	Just like that Robobuddy of yours...\nYour "friends" always seem to be\nsurprising me.
11	H	Haha, yeah. I guess the control\ncircuits still need some calibrating.\nSorry for the shock.
12	H	It's weird, 'cause it ran like an\nabsolute dream in the test run...
13	4	Hold on...
14	4	How did you even deploy it here?\nColony 30 shouldn't have access to\nthose kinds of supplies...
15	H	Oh, I built the launch equipment from\nscratch! After all that hassle Q caused\npoor Alex...
16	H	And all the supplies Colony Iota's\nbeen sharing with us...
17	H	I just wanted to give\nsomething back, you know?
18	1	Did you, by any chance,\nget the parts from Colony Tau?
19	H	Not just Tau.
20	H	Colony 4 and Colony Lambda\nprovided too!
21	H	And that's not all!
22	H	Colony Gamma gave us a hand as well!
23	H	Colony 9 contributed also!
24	H	Colony Mu helped us out too!
25	H	Even Colony 11 chipped in!
26	H	Basically, everyone pitched in and the\nwork was finished in no time flat!
27	K	You collaborated with other colonies?
28	H	Yeah, the Collectopaedia Cards\nmade it easy. Frictionless trade!
29	H	You came up with them, didn't you?\nThat's such a genius idea! I'm in awe!\nTotally gobsmacked!
30	5	That makes two of us, mate.
31	H	You too, Lanz?
32	H	Hey, we should start a club!
33	5	Oh, pack that in!
34	Yb1	This whole thing is really bizarre...
35	K	...
36	Yb1	...Dame Alex?
37	K	Chickadee, I...
38	K	I thought I was doing all this to see\nwhat life looks like from the outside,\nunbound by rules.
39	K	But perhaps...I only wanted to see\nhow people change.
40	K	We have been indoctrinated to fight\nall our lives. Yet still, there is a warmth\nin us that remains...
41	K	Think then about how the world might\nchange, were we to share that warmth.\nThat's what I want to see.
42	K	I want to like it all. I want to like\npeople, I want to like the world.
43	Yb1	...That's it, right there. Your face right now\nis what I've always wanted to see.
44	Yb1	I'm so glad. We're finally seeing\nthings in the same light...
45	K	Oh, this is only the beginning,\nI'm sure...
46	K	But it's up to us to maintain and\nfoster these relationships.
47	K	I want to see more.\nMore of these bright, auspicious scenes...
48	Yb1	And I'll be right by your side,\nall the way!
49	K	You have to do more than that.\nYou have to aim to surpass me.
50	Yb1	I...I will!
51	K	Haha...\nAnd I'll continue to grow, myself.
52	K	Just as you all are...

0	Wb1	Rowland of Colony Tau.
1	Wb1	He's started collecting Levnis parts\nat quite the alarming rate, and in large\nquantities at that.
2	Wb1	I hope he's not planning something.
3	Wb1	How were things at Colony Tau?
4	K	We were right to go there directly.\nIt looks like something interesting's\ngoing on.
5	K	But there are a couple of things\nI want to be sure of first. Would you\nmind being patient a while longer?
6	Wb1	OK. I'll busy myself\nwith other things.
7	Wb1	Don't get yourself caught up\nin anything dumb, all right?

1	Xb1	Sooner you finish, sooner we go home.
2	bb1	There's nothing stopping you\nfrom helping too, Captain!
3	Xb1	Oh, is that what you want?
4	bb1	Is that what I-... Give me strength!\nYou're a tenth-termer, for sparks' sakes!\nHow can you be so...
5	bb1	Hey, what's going on?
6	2	We were looking to pick up\nthe supply drop...
7	2	Looks like you beat us to it.
8	Xb1	Oh, we knew it'd fall here.
9	Xb1	My Iris gives good forecasts\non pretty much anything.
10	Xb1	You know, like meeting you again\nhere like this. It was meant to be...
11	3	'Scuse me?
12	bb1	You need to have a handle on what\neach colony has in its possession, and\nwhat it's requested from the Castle.
13	bb1	Take into account how hot the fighting is\nin each region, learn the lay of the land,\nand you can infer the good drop-off points.
14	4	You're very well-informed.
15	bb1	Our intelligence is unmatched.
16	4	I find that somewhat hard to believe...
17	Xb1	Looks like we got ourselves a doubter.\nYou'll come round, Scruff.
18	4	"Scruff"?
19	Xb1	We've got a few other drop-off points\non our radar, at Three Heroes Peak\nand Namba Mound.
20	Xb1	Pick your poison.
21	3	And why the snuff do we have to\ngo around running your errands for-
22	4	It's tempting.
23	4	I had planned to verify the accuracy\nof Colony Iota's information anyway.
24	3	Ugh, are you out of your mind?
25	Xb1	Hey, we're not strapped for resources.\nJust bring back what you find to the\ncolony and that'll be swell.
26	K	Making good use of us, are you?
27	Xb1	Just following your example, Lexy!
28	K	Cheeky...
29	bb1	As you can see, he's lacking\nmotivation at the moment.
30	bb1	Pissing about like this as a tenth-termer...\nHe's setting a terrible example to the new\nrecruits.
31	Xb1	Hey, if ever there was a better time\nfor me to piss about, it's now.
32	Xb1	It just clicked one day. Suddenly started\nwondering if this is really how I want to\ngo out, you know?
33	2	I see...
34		What does Fili want?
35		He wants to challenge his potential.
36	2	Are you sort of, challenging\nyour potential?
37		He wants to have more fun.
38	2	You want to have more fun, is that it?
39	Xb1	Bingo. You get me, Mio.
40	Xb1	Are you free later? We should\ntalk more, one on one.
41	bb1	Too bad you aren't free later, Captain.\nBecause you're busy. Aren't you?
42	Xb1	Oof, Caspar... Right in the gut...
43	2	They really landed at the drop points...
44	2	We'll report to Colony Iota\nwhen we're done.
45	bb1	Apologies for...everything.\nThanks for this.
evt/nq/msg_nq130601f.json
0		You hand over the extra provisions.
1	Xb1	Right, I think we're good here.
2	Xb1	Satisfied that we're as good\nas we say now, Scruff?
3	4	I have a name-
4	Xb1	Take care of the commander, Taion.
5	Xb1	'Fraid I won't be able to grace you\nwith my presence any more.
6	4	Your time's up...?
7	K	I did think it was odd.
8	K	It's not just about the time you've got left.
9	K	You mean to leave, don't you?
10	Xb1	Yeesh. You're just too perceptive,\nCommander. You got me.
11	bb1	...What?
12	bb1	I hadn't heard anything about this!
13	Xb1	Yeah, I just made up my mind.
14	Xb1	Colony 4, I'm thinking. I hear it's\nfull of drive and ambition.
15	Xb1	I wanna see if I can make it there.
16	Xb1	Figured I'd try Colony 30.\nBet there's never a dull moment\nwith all those Nopon around.
17	Xb1	I want to party like a 'Pon\nat least once before I go.
18	Xb1	Thanks for the inspiration, Mio.
19	2	Is this such a good idea?\nIf you leave now...
20	K	It means goodbye, once and for all.
21	K	But you're going to leave anyway.
22	Xb1	Look, Colony Iota is fantastic. Really.\nYou value and reward hard work.
23	Xb1	But you know what? Maybe I'm the person\nwho should judge the value of my life.
24	K	...Well. Color me speechless.
25	Xb1	You'll be OK, Lexy. I know it'll be tough\nwithout me, but you'll survive.
26	K	Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
27	Xb1	Is that a weight off for you?\nBe honest now.
28	K	...
29	bb1	...I've always suspected, but now\nI know for certain. Our captain is\nan imbecile.
30	Xb1	Ouch. That cuts deep, man!\nNot that you're wrong.
31	bb1	I'll take over your duties.
32	bb1	You go ahead and live out\nyour days the way you want to.\nKeep smiling to the end.
33	Xb1	Haha! Yeah, I think I can\nmanage that, mate.
34	Xb1	Well, I'm going to head off\nbefore things get depressing.

1	1	I've never seen any with\ngarbled text like that before.
2	3	And it's weird that someone\nissued the exact same request\nmultiple times.
3	5	Think our Irises are broken?
4	4	...Don't scare me like that. The very\npossibility makes me shudder.
5	6	Maybe it's a bug in the card itself?
6	3	Bet you anything one of Alex's people\nwould know. They're the ones who\ncame up with 'em.
7	2	Agreed. Let's see what she\nhas to say about it.
8	K	That sounds like something\nto ask Sequoia.
9	K	If it really is a bug, she'll be in the most\nfoul mood until the matter's resolved.

0	Wb1	A Collectopaedia Card bug?\nOh, is this about the comment text?
1	2	Do you know why it's happening?
2	Wb1	Interference caused by black fog.\nStill just a theory, though.
3	Wb1	I assure you, the tool itself is bug-free.\nAnd I'm happy to have a word with\nanyone who isn't.
4	3	Phew, touchy subject, eh?
5	Wb1	Do you keep getting repeated requests\nfrom someone called Sif? It's starting to\ndrive me up the wall.
6	Wb1	We heard you the first time!\nWaste of everybody's time and effort.
7	3	Yeah, spamming messages seems like\na surefire way to tick folks off...
8	2	...Maybe that's what they want.
9	2	Maybe they don't need to get the thing\nthey've requested. Maybe what they\nwant is for the request itself to be seen.
10	Wb1	...Ah.
11	Wb1	What they've asked for can be found\nthroughout the tunnels, no bother.
12	Wb1	A black fog's just rolled in around\nthat area too. Which means...
13	3	Sparks... Something's happened\nin the tunnels?!
14	Wb1	I can't say for sure. But it certainly\nlooks like something's going on.

3	nc1	Yeah, it came out all scrambled, right?\nSo much for the coded message...
4	4	That's what the Collectopaedia\nCard request was?
5	nc1	It was a pretty big gamble. I didn't\nknow if anyone would crack it.
6	nc1	If I couldn't use words, I thought I'd\nat least try to hint at the location.
7	4	Sequoia guessed right then.
8	nc1	Sequoia?

4	ob1	Ah yeah, I guess you don't\nknow about this.
5	ob1	Today's Harvest Day.\nIt only happens once a month.
6	1	What's Harvest Day?
7	K	It's an evaluation day, basically.
8	K	Every month we evaluate soldiers on\ntheir cooperation, boldness and results.
9	K	It's a day for us to show our appreciation\nof the soldiers who contribute the most to\nthe colony.
10	3	...Can I be straight with you?\nIn my book, evaluations are pretty\nmuch the exact opposite of fun.
11	K	Oh, it's not the evaluation\neveryone's looking forward to.

13	3	What, like...anything?!

15	6	Or some Seafoam Soap...?
16	K	Anything. Within the realms\nof possibility, of course.

18	pb1	It's an evaluation day, basically.

36	3	Shall we go get her? You can\nkeep the show going, yeah?
37	Yb1	Oh, I couldn't ask you\nto go to all that trouble...
38	6	We don't mind! You just\nkeep doing your job!
39	Yb1	Well...if you're insisting!\nThank you so much.
40	Yb1	Then could you give this to her?
41	2	You don't have to give it\nto her in person?
42	Yb1	Sequoia's team's really busy at the\nmoment. I wonder if there's something\ngoing on with them.
43	Yb1	They won't mind, I'm sure.\nJust tell them I sent you.
44	2	All right, we'll go.
45	K	I wouldn't mind talking to Misaka\nmyself. Can I leave you to take care\nof things on your end?
46	Yb1	All in a day's work!
evt/nq/msg_nq130801f.json
0	ib1	Ugh... How could this...?
1	ib1	I just can't... It's all so...\n(mumble mumble)
2	6	She's asleep!
3	K	Hyah!
4	ib1	...Gah!
5	ib1	Whassit? Enemy raid?!
6	K	I think she's awake now.
7	ib1	D-Dame Alex?!
8	5	What did she just do to her?!
9	4	I understand opening up acupuncture\npoints is one way to relieve fatigue...
10	5	Yeah, and so's a punch in the kisser!
11	K	You know you've been selected for\nHarvest Day, right? You should have\nbeen notified already.
12	3	Gonna have to wake her up,\naren't we?
13	3	Tickle tickle...
14	ib1	...Yeeek!!!
15	ib1	Don't do that, I'm ticklish!
16	3	My bad. But we had to\nthink of something.
17	5	Those wings can be a real\ninstrument of torture, eh?
18	4	I didn't realize you could\ndo that with them...
19	2	You know you've been selected for\nHarvest Day, right? You should have\nbeen notified already.
20	ib1	Ohhh, now I remember! I thought\nI'd have a little nap till it was time...
21	ib1	Oh no, the awards ceremony...\nIt's now!
22	3	Yeah, OK, pause your Ponios!\nWhy d'you think we came all this way?
23		You hand over the\nHarvest Day Tiara.
24	tb1	...Oh!
25	tb1	Yay! I did it! Now I can\nget my luxury shampoo!
26	3	Chickadee sends her regards,\nand all that guff.
27	6	Congratulations!
28	tb1	Thanks!
29	K	Try not to oversleep in future. If this\nwas the battlefield, you'd be dead.
30	tb1	Argh... Sorry...
31	K	But you've done some sterling work.
32	K	I'm expecting good things from\nyou in future too, Misaka.
33	tb1	Y-yes, ma'am! I won't let you down!
34	tb1	Anyway, you'll have to excuse me.\nThere's procedure to follow!
35	sb1	Good shampoo is hard to come by.\nHarvest Day is about the only chance\nto get your hands on it.
36	sb1	Sorry for the inconvenience.
37	4	Not at all, it's been an\nenlightening experience.
38	1	How long have you had this\nevaluation system in place?
39	sb1	Since Chickadee arrived, I think.\nSo for two years now.
40	4	About the same time as Colony\nIota started to distinguish itself.
41	sb1	That girl's not much of a fighter, but\nshe really excels at this kind of thing.
42	sb1	Anyway, if you want to know more\nabout how it all works, you should\nask Chickadee herself.
43	2	That makes sense. We need to\nreport back about Misaka anyway.
44	2	Let's get back to Chickadee.
evt/nq/msg_nq130802t.json
0	Yb1	I expect you'll find Misaka in\nthe intel analysis suite.
1	Yb1	Sequoia's team is really busy at the\nmoment. I wonder if there's something\ngoing on with them.
2	Yb1	They won't mind, I'm sure.\nJust tell them I sent you.
3	2	Good work with everything, Chickadee.\nWe gave the tiara to Misaka.
4	Yb1	All the awards have been given out!\nThank you so much for your help.
5	2	You said Sequoia's team was busy.\nWell, it looks like it's taken its toll\non Misaka.
6	Yb1	Following Collectopaedia Card movements\ntakes great patience and concentration.
7	Yb1	That's why I wanted to make something\nlike Harvest Day, to show people their\nhard work was appreciated.
8	2	Ah, so the evaluation system\nwas your idea?
9	Yb1	It was. And somehow I made it come\nto fruition, with Dame Alex's backing.
10	Yb1	If all we wanted was an evaluation\nsystem, the Flame Clock and Homecoming\nwould have done the job just fine.
11	Yb1	But you have to wait so long to see\nresults that way. I wanted something\na bit more immediate.
12	4	A good way to improve soldiers' skills.
13	4	It serves a direct personal benefit,\nand stops people losing heart.
14	Yb1	I'm not really one of nature's fighters...\nBut if this is the only way I can support\nthe colony, then I'll do it with pride.
15	Yb1	And now that the colony's been freed,\nI can do so much more!
16	Yb1	Thank you, everyone!
evt/nq/msg_nq130803t.json
0	Wb1	Misaka? Yeah, she was here,\nbut I chased her out.
1	3	You chased her?!
2	Wb1	She said she had a headache.\nI told her to sleep it off.
3	Wb1	You can probably find her resting\nin the medical ward.
4	Wb1	It's Harvest Day today, isn't it?
5	Wb1	I never know what day it is.\nIt's terrible.
6	6	We gave Misaka her tiara, though.\nShe was super pleased!
7	Wb1	She's a hard worker, so I'm\nglad to see it recognized.
8	Wb1	And she's quite a thoughtful girl, Chickadee.\n...Well. In some ways more than others.

4	rd1	Gingin fine. Gingin waiting for\nday when seven anvils ring.
5	rd1	Only at then, will Gingin leave garden.
6	2	I see. There's something you have to do.
7	6	Oh, huh.
8	6	Well, I guess we'll come back\nand see you someday.
evt/nq/msg_nq210100s.json
0	4	I hear Colony Lambda's having a difficult\ntime now that they can't use the canteen.
1	6	Yeeeah... We did kind of\ntear up the place...
2	2	Mm. But if there's anything we can do...
3	3	We could cook something up for them?
4	1	That's only going to help them\nin the short term.
5	5	Then what? Don't tell me you wanna\nbuild them a whole new canteen...?
6	4	...That's a surprisingly\nreasonable idea, Lanz.
7	5	Oh, well then, I'll just cobble\none together, shall I?
8	1	We couldn't do the labor ourselves,\nbut Lambda's a big colony. It can't\nhurt to float the idea.
9	4	I imagine talking to the captain of\nthe manufacturing unit would be\na good place to start.
10	6	Sounds like a plan.\nLet's get going!
11	2	Yes, the sooner this\ngets resolved, the better.
evt/nq/msg_nq210101t.json
0	1	Do you have a minute?
1	nc1	...Can't you see I'm busy?\nCome on, keep it brief.
2	2	We were wondering if we might\nbe able to help fix up the canteen.
3	nc1	Oh yeah? That'd be a big help. We're\neager to get it back up and running too.
4	1	Is there a reason you haven't done it yet?
5	nc1	I've put in a request, but there's\nso much else going on, I haven't\ngot approval yet.
6	3	You need approval to work?
7	nc1	Yeah. We can't just go around\nbuilding things willy-nilly.
8	5	Oh, great. Gotta love a bit of red tape...
9	6	If we can get you approval,\nwould you be able to start work?
10	nc1	If you can manage it,\nthat would be fantastic.
11	4	Then we'll arrange it. Who's\nin charge of approvals?
12	nc1	The head of the engineering corps and\nchief of logistics are the people you want.\nAnd we'll need some helping hands too.
13	nc1	The chief of engineering's pretty forgetful.\nProbably still hasn't filed my request...
14	nc1	I bet Whitby's climbing the walls with\nhow long it's all taking. Whitby's chief\nof logistics.
15	nc1	You could talk to the head of the supply\ncorps, as well. She's always rushed off\nher feet. Reckon she could use a hand.
16	3	That's a lot of people to see.
17	nc1	The request's probably been held up\nsomewhere in the pipeline. Sorry for\nthe trouble.
evt/nq/msg_nq210102t.json
0	nc1	The head of the engineering corps and\nchief of logistics are the people you want.\nAnd we'll need some helping hands too.
1	nc1	And while you're at it, could you pop\nin on the head of the supply corps?
evt/nq/msg_nq210103t.json
0	5	Hey, have you got an unapproved\nrequest knocking about?
1	sc1	A what now?\nWhat request would that be?
2	1	It's a request from the manufacturing\ncorps to start work on the canteen.\nDo you remember seeing it?
3	sc1	...Now you say it,\nthat does ring a bell...
4	2	We've come to get the\napproval confirmed...
5	sc1	Sure, I don't have any problem with it.\nI'd love the canteen to be back up and\nrunning as soon as possible.
6	sc1	But...my people are a little preoccupied\nwith something at the moment, so you\nmay have to be patient.
7	3	And what exactly's more important\nthan having a proper canteen?
8	sc1	I wish I knew. But that request came in\nfirst and it's all been discussed...
9	sc1	Anyway, you've got my approval.\nI'll send someone over on the double.
10	1	Thanks, that's great.
11	sc1	Have you been to the chief of logistics?\nYou should, if you haven't.
12	sc1	When you get clearance from everyone,\ngo and report back to Sif.
evt/nq/msg_nq210104t.json
0	sc1	Have you got approval from\nthe others? If not, you've still\ngot a bit of legwork to do.
evt/nq/msg_nq210105t.json
0	qc1	Hey, what's up?
1	4	We're looking to gather approvals\nfor Sif, for the canteen restoration.
2	qc1	Oh, thanks for that.
3	qc1	Not being able to use the canteen's\npiling on the work for the supply corps.
4	qc1	We have no food storage, so\nanything perishable has to go.
5	qc1	Having a working canteen again\nwould be like a dream...
6	1	So we should work on getting\nthose approvals, then?
7	qc1	Absolutely.
8	qc1	I wonder if the request got held up\nsomewhere... In any case, thanks for\nlooking into it!
9	6	Well, we're the ones who\ntrashed it in the first place...
10	qc1	Have you tried asking around the\nengineering and logistics corps?
11	qc1	The canteen request's probably with\nthem. You'll want to pay them a call\nif you haven't already.
evt/nq/msg_nq210106t.json
0	qc1	Have you talked to the heads\nof engineering and logistics?
1	qc1	The canteen request's probably with\nthem. You'll want to give them a call\nif you haven't already.
evt/nq/msg_nq210107t.json
0	rc1	What's up with all of you?
1	5	We came to get your approval\nfor the new canteen.
2	rc1	Oh yeah?\nDon't bring all that to my door.
3	6	What?
4	rc1	I gave it my stamp of approval soon\nas it crossed my desk, sunshine.
5	rc1	But it looks like it's got tangled up in\nred tape somewhere. We can't go without\nstorage for munitions and food forever.
6	2	Ah, so that's what's happened...
7	rc1	No idea why you're the ones chasing\nthis up, but seeing as you are, I'm going\nto need you to be quick about it.
evt/nq/msg_nq210108t.json
0	rc1	It'll have got caught up in red tape\nsomewhere. Better find out which\nnumpty hasn't approved it yet.
evt/nq/msg_nq210109t.json
0	nc1	Did you get it all approved? Amazing!
1	1	So, now what?
2	nc1	Just got to get the commander's\nstamp on it, and work can begin.
3	5	Why is nothing simple?
4	nc1	I'm really sorry, but could I ask you to go\nand have a chat with Commander Isurd?
5	2	Of course, we'll go.
6	1	Of course.
evt/nq/msg_nq210110t.json
0	nc1	I'm really sorry, but I'll have to ask you\nto go and see Commander Isurd as well...
1	nc1	Go and speak with Commander Isurd in his\noffice. I'd like him to issue the go-ahead.
2	1	Sure thing, will do.
evt/nq/msg_nq210111f.json
0	A	Oh, hello, you lot.\nWhat can I do for you?
1	1	Would you mind stamping this for us?
2	A	Not at all. Sorry you had to\nget involved in all this.
3	5	You don't make it easy, do you?\nAll these hoops you have to jump\nthrough to get stuff done...
4	A	A fair point. But it's all in the\nname of betterment.
5	A	I believe that our greatest asset lies\nin our desire to strive for more.
6	A	There, that's all approved. Give\nthe good news to Sif, would you?
7	1	Thanks. We'll be quick.
evt/nq/msg_nq210112f.json
0	nc1	You got it done? Fabulous!
1	1	What happens now?
2	A	I give it a stamp, and that's it, done.
3	A	The stamp's in the Commander's\nOffice. Would you come with me?
4	1	Sure.
evt/nq/msg_nq210113f.json
0	A	Sorry you had to get involved in all this.\nNow that the request's come through, we\ncan start work on the canteen quickly.
1	5	You don't make it easy, do you?\nAll these hoops you have to jump\nthrough to get stuff done...
2	A	A fair point. But it's all in the\nname of betterment.
3	A	I believe that our greatest asset lies\nin our desire to strive for more.
4	4	Now, shall we get back to Sif?\nNo doubt he's waiting on tenterhooks.
5	1	Let's go.
evt/nq/msg_nq210114t.json
0	nc1	Great! We'll set to work on the\nconstruction first thing!
1	nc1	Thanks, you guys. I don't normally need\nto get this many approvals. Everything's\nbeen moving at a Blant's pace.
2	3	If the system ain't working, kick it!\nMake a better one!
3	5	What she said.
4	nc1	Well, that might be fine for a small group\nlike you, but you can't let everyone do as\nthey want in a colony this big.
5	nc1	As long as you set down good rules,\nyou can avoid a lot of trouble.
6	nc1	With the approval system, you always\nknow exactly what you should be doing\nand when.
7	1	It makes a lot of sense. I can see\nhow sharing info between teams\nwould cut down on problems.
8	nc1	Right? We're all working like a\nwell-oiled Ferronis, and it's given\nus some real results.
9	nc1	Requests and approvals are pretty\nimportant. They're part and parcel\nof Colony Lambda's work ethic.
10	nc1	When we've got the work team together\nand repaired the canteen, you'll have to\ncome back and see, yeah?
11	6	Totally! We're not missing out on that!
evt/nq/msg_nq210200s.json
0	6	So, Lambda's off-seer Shijima\nhas apparently gone missing...
1	2	It's a bit worrying, isn't it?
2	5	Agnus off-seers often work\nin pairs, right?
3	2	Yes, I think most Agnian colonies\nmake use of similar arrangements.
4	1	Are both of them missing, then?
5	4	All we've heard is that the one named\nShijima has headed into the tunnels.
6	2	By now, he might have come out at the\nRae-Bel Tableland in the Fornis region.
7	1	Something might have happened,\nto make him wander off like that.\nWe should look for him.
8	4	Then we'd best hurry - the longer\nwe wait, the more difficult the\nsearch is likely to be.
evt/nq/msg_nq210201t.json
0	pc1	What are you doing here?
1	4	We're on the hunt for Lambda's\nmissing off-seer. Everyone's been\nquite worried, you know.
2	pc1	...Ah.
3	pc1	But I'm fine. I haven't come across\nany monsters or hostile colonies...
4	3	Uhm, we were looking for a guy\nnamed Shijima, I thought...?
5	pc1	Ah, well, he... He was making his way\ntowards Eagus Wilderness, I think.
6	5	But why did he go alone?\nWhat could he want out there?
7	pc1	I think he must have been\nheading for the Castle...
8	pc1	He's really close to his Homecoming,\nand he'd asked me to send him off.
9	pc1	But then the Flame Clock was broken,\nand all of that stuff became irrelevant...\nI think...he's just a bit lost.
10	2	Oh, I see.
11	pc1	I put in a request for the survey branch\nand tactics division to assemble a search\nparty, but I don't know when it'll happen.
12	pc1	I've been doing all I can to help,\nbut honestly, maybe it's better to\nlet him do what he wants.
13	6	Still, the way he's feeling... Don't you think\nit'd be best if you just talked to him...?
14	pc1	How? He won't even accept my calls.\nThere's only so much one person can do...
15	1	Then we'll bring him back.\nI'm sure you have at least something\nyou want to say to him?
evt/nq/msg_nq210202f.json

1	4	That's our line, surely. You're the one who\ndecided to up and run off out of the blue.
2	oc1	...
3	1	You've made Moraine very worried.\nShe's been trying really hard to get\nahold of you.
4	oc1	Moraine?! ...Right. I should have\nbeen clearer. Should've told her to\nstay at home and leave me be.
5	5	It's crazy to come out here alone, mate.
6	oc1	...You know what my goal in life was?
7	oc1	Live to my Homecoming.\nHave a peaceful death.
8	5	Yeah, cool biscuits, but that's no excuse\nto go charging off without saying a word\nto anyone, you know what I'm saying?
9	oc1	Do you think they'd have given\nme permission to leave if I had?
10	oc1	Heading to the Castle alone\nwas the only way.
11	2	I still think you could have\ndiscussed it with Moraine first.\nShe's your colleague.
12	2	She really is worried sick about you.
13	oc1	I was thinking that if I die out here\nthen at least I'd be alone... I suppose\nit wasn't really fair to Moraine.
14	6	So come home! There's still\ntime for you to talk this out.
15	oc1	Yeah, I know. OK. Enough.\nI can't go any further alone, anyway.
16	oc1	I'd better go apologize to her...
evt/nq/msg_nq210204f.json

evt/nq/msg_nq210205f.json
0	6	Phew... I guess we\ndodged a bullet there.
1	5	Where'd they come crawling\nout from, anyhow?
2	3	Scratch that, where's Moraine?\nIs she hiding? Did she run?
3	1	It doesn't look like she\nwas attacked.

4	oc1	Glad to hear it.
5	pc1	You... You came back.
6	oc1	Yeah, thanks to this lot.\nIf I was alone...who knows what\nwould've become of me?
7	4	I'm not sure what you were hoping\nto achieve by going to the Castle in\nthe first place.
8	4	Aiming for the impossible is unlikely\nto end in the way you hope it will.
9	oc1	Huh...
10	1	I think you should go home and\ntalk about what happens next.
11	1	Moraine was worried about you, and the\nleast you can do is respect those feelings.
12	oc1	...I know. Moraine, I'm sorry, I-
13	pc1	It's OK. Let's go home. Everyone\nknows things are hard for you.

1	1	You mean the ones we took down with\nIsurd, after the cave-in?
2	6	It's weird... We still don't know\nwhy they flipped out like that.
3	5	Not only does the colony's best\nline of defense go berserk, it shuts\ndown altogether. I don't like it.
4	2	Shall we go and look into things?
5	3	Yeah, there's probably\nsomething we can help with.
6	1	Then let's go and see.
evt/nq/msg_nq210301t.json
0	1	So, are the Auto-Levs still out of action?
1	sc1	I'm afraid so. Captain Rosh wanted them up\nand running again, though. We've just been\nworking on it with engineering.
2	5	Drawing on his clout, eh?
3	sc1	Rosh may be a captain, but he's got\na real careless streak. Other units are\nalways on his back.
4	sc1	Anyway, some of the adjustments\nhave just been finished.
5	5	Oh, so they work?
6	sc1	..."Work" is maybe a strong word.
7	sc1	We've taken ourselves off the list of\ntargets, so they shouldn't behave like\nthey did before. In theory!
8	3	Better put that theory into practice,\nthen. I don't fancy another tango with\nthose buckets o' bolts.
9	sc1	Oh, then you should come with me!
10	3	You sure about that?
11	sc1	I just want to do a little behavioral test.\nYou can help out!
12	1	Sure, if it's just a small task.
13	5	...OK, stupid question - what's it\ngonna do to us if it doesn't behave\nlike you want it to?
14	sc1	That's a very good question, actually,\nand I'd be happy to answer it in detail...\nin the Urayan Tunnels.

8	4	Well, look on the bright side -\nit's shown no hostility toward us.
9	sc1	Oh, that wasn't the test! I mean come on,\nwhat good is this thing if it's not going to\nfight potential threats for us?
10	1	I don't exactly see many enemies\naround here, though...
11	sc1	I'm sure there are some soldiers\nbumbling around here somewhere.
12	sc1	There's been a lot of them\nwandering right in lately.
13	2	And...your Auto-Lev can\ntrack them down?
14	sc1	It's not out of the question,\nbut we haven't tested it.
15	sc1	So I'm going to need you\nto bring the enemies to us!
16	6	You want us to lure them?
17	sc1	That's right! I'm testing its behavior,\nand in a battle you'd be fighting\nalongside the Auto-Lev. See?
18	3	...You make it sound so easy.
19	1	OK, we'll see what we can do.\nI did say we'd help if we could.
20	sc1	Thanks!
evt/nq/msg_nq210303f.json
0	6	Hey, enemies at over there o'clock!
1	4	Kevesi soldiers, eh? And how are we\nto bring them with us, exactly?
2	1	How about we send one person out\nas bait to lure them in? If we all go,\nthey'll just scatter.
3	5	Can't think of any better ideas.\nOK, let's get it over with.
4	3	Thanks for volunteering.
5	2	What, me?
6	3	They're Kevesi, innit?\nIt won't do any good if I toddle\nmy Kevesi bum over there.
7	2	Well...I suppose not, no.
8	3	And we need someone who's\nquick and on the ball, yeah?
9	2	OK, fine. I'll do it.
10	2	...
11	vd1	Hey! You! What are you up to?!
12	wd1	Someone from Colony Lambda?\nWhatever, we'll make you talk\nonce we take you in!
13	vd1	She ran off over there! Get her!
14	5	Got it in one...
15	3	Nice work.
16	2	That was...nerve-wracking.
17	1	Let's get back to the Auto-Lev.
18	4	Your Kevesi soldiers are on their way!
19	sc1	Wow, you really did it.
20	5	What, you thought we'd snuff up?!
21	3	Who cares, get the Auto-Lev\nwarmed up! They're coming!
22	sc1	On it!
evt/nq/msg_nq210304f.json
0	1	That went well.
1	sc1	Yeah, the numbers\nlook pretty good too.
2	sc1	I was worried about how it would\nreact, but it all turned out fine.
3	5	Oh, you were worried, were you?
4	4	I have to say, though, it's looking more\nor less battle-ready at this point.
5	sc1	Yep! Thanks for your help!
6	sc1	Time to discuss deployment with Tulgrim.
7	sc1	I've got a little thank you\nfor you too, so pop by later!
8	5	Does she ever stand still?
evt/nq/msg_nq210305t.json
0	sc1	Hey, you made it!
1	1	Is everything still OK?
2	sc1	Yep, we're hunky-dory! The team's\njust finished all the fine-tuning, and\nwe're in talks with the survey branch.
3	sc1	We'll probably be able to properly\nrelaunch it soon, so thanks for helping\nus get to this point!
4	4	We hardly did anything, really.\nNo need to thank us.
5	sc1	In that case, would you be willing\nto help us out again if any of these\ntin cans go wrong in future?
6	3	Hey now, don't push your luck...
7	sc1	I'm joking! We know how to\nhandle ourselves.
8	sc1	But I really am grateful to you.\nI don't think we could have\ndone this without you.
9	5	Yeah, just try not to break it.
10	3	Tell Captain Careless\nhe owes us one!
11	sc1	Captain Rosh smoothed things over\nbetween the teams. He's pretty reliable\nin battle, too. Lots of experience.
12	sc1	I'll pass it on. Thanks!
evt/nq/msg_nq210401f.json
0	vc1	If we're going to head off down the\nUrayan Trail, we'll need to secure a\nroute first.
1	xc1	The trail's pretty exposed.\nI'd rather not court danger unduly...
2	qc1	Be as careful as you need. We just\nneed to get those supplies back.
3	xc1	You need to let it go.\nIt can't be worth the risk...
4	5	What's up, guys? Trouble in paradise?
5	xc1	Oh, hello. No, it's nothing major.
6	vc1	We'd made preparations to take the\nUrayan Trail for a prospective attack\non Colony 5.
7	vc1	None of that's relevant now, but the\nsupplies we sent up there just got left.
8	xc1	The three of us have been talking about\nwhether we should try and get them back.
9	2	Recovering supplies doesn't\nseem like that hard a task.
10	qc1	That's not really the problem.
11	vc1	There's a big enemy presence in\nthe area. They've probably already\ncaught wind of our stashes.
12	xc1	There's a chance they might try to set up an\nambush, or booby trap them, or something.
13	qc1	And we can't use an Auto-Lev, them being\npurely defensive, so we were trying to figure\nout a way to do it by ourselves.
14	xc1	Situation being how it is, I personally think\nit'd be wiser to just abandon the idea, but\nTulgrim and Hozumi think it's vital, so...
15	1	Yeah, I see... It's not easy to recover\nsupplies without a Levnis.
16	qc1	Exactly. I...don't suppose you lot\nwould be willing to lend us a hand?
17	3	...Sure, whatever.
18	xc1	Oh, well, if you'd be willing to help, then\nthat changes it completely. We could split up\nand advance in parallel. Much safer that way.
19	qc1	If we cover the mountainous parts,\nwould you be able to secure the area\nwith the supplies?
20	5	If other colonies have got their\neyes on this, seems like a scrap's\npretty much the order of the day.
21	vc1	Yeah, battle is pretty likely. All we need\nis for things to be calm enough for us\nto go in, get the stuff, and get out.
22	1	Understood. We'll go\nand have a look.
evt/nq/msg_nq210402f.json
0	4	It looks like we found what\nwe've been looking for.
1	2	Yes. Let Colony Lambda\ntake care of the rest.
2	mc1	Lookee what we caught. Little soldiers\nhoping to make off with the supplies.
3	5	Oh, great. An ambush.
4	mc1	Must be from Colony Lambda. Well,\nthere's only one cure for these fools.
5	mc1	So sad. We're taking you down right here,\nand the supplies are coming with us!
6	6	Hold it! We've got monsters!
7	2	Should we retreat?
8	5	I dunno, ask the guys who\nhave us surrounded.
9	1	Let's save the arguments for when\nwe've taken these monsters out!
10	mc1	Oh yeah, you want to play allies and\nthen stab us in the back? Don't think so.\nWe'll take you all out together!
evt/nq/msg_nq210403f.json
0	xc1	Everyone OK?!
1	xc1	We saw you fighting and tried to\nmobilize as soon as we could, but...
2	5	Not necessary, mate.
3	xc1	Yeah... You're pretty tough customers.
4	2	We kept the supplies intact, but it's\nonly a matter of time before someone\nelse comes for them.
5	xc1	Yeah. We'll get them shifted.\nThanks a lot.
6	xc1	This place really is crawling with\ntrouble, though. We'll have to\nreassess the deployment...
7	6	Can we help out with that?
8	xc1	No, you're OK. I'll discuss\nit with the bods in charge.
9	1	That sounds like a plan.
10	xc1	Right, I'll be off. Thanks again.
11	1	I'm sure Colony Lambda has\neverything well in hand.
12	4	Indeed. We shouldn't interfere\nin their affairs too much.
13	1	OK then. Time for us to be off ourselves.
evt/nq/msg_nq210404t.json
0	xc1	We'll cover you from above.\nYou just confirm that the supply\nlocation is enemy-free.
evt/nq/msg_nq210405t.json
0	qc1	The supplies are near Elsayer Cape, on\nRae-Bel Tableland. Could you have a look?
evt/nq/msg_nq210406t.json
0	vc1	You can expect monsters and enemy\nsoldiers to be skulking around. Go careful\naround those supplies, OK?
evt/nq/msg_nq210500s.json
0	1	They say Colony Lambda's been\nraking in the ether lately.
1	3	Yeah, some bloke called Koji's\nmeant to be behind it all.
2	4	He seems to have pressured the\ncommander personally. Which\nsounds like Koji.
3	5	They've always had some ether,\nI thought. They mined it, didn't they?
4	4	They're saying that there's huge amounts\nof it now. It takes some skill to produce\nsuch results in that length of time.
5	2	Accomplishing something like that in\nColony Lambda? That's no small feat.
6	1	There are so many colonies that never\nhave enough ether, and here's Colony\nLambda, sitting on a hoard of it.
7	2	They're saying they have too much, even.
8	6	Can't they share some\nwith other colonies?
9	5	Yeah, what's stopping 'em?\nHow about we ask 'em ourselves?
10	1	I'm curious too. Let's find out.
evt/nq/msg_nq210501t.json
0	uc1	Hey, what can I do for you?
1	2	We heard you're doing well for ether at\nthe moment. Do you have any ideas how\nyou're going to use it?
2	uc1	Ah, you want to know? Yeah, we're sitting\non more ether than we can collect.
3	uc1	The work's been going better than\nwe could ever have imagined since\nwe perfected the ether probe.
4	4	Ah, that must have greatly improved\nthe efficiency of your mining operations.
5	uc1	Me and Varen are the minds behind it.\nWe wanted a more effective way to find\nether channels.
6	3	Not bad.
7	uc1	It's done wonders for our ether stocks,\nbut yeah, lately it's a bit excessive.
8	uc1	What a problem to have, right? Oh no,\nwe have too much ether! How awful!
9	1	If you've got too much, why not use it?
10	uc1	OK, let's think about this.\nAny good ideas?
11		Any good ideas?
12		Share it freely among the colonies
13		Donate it to colonies in need
14		Give it to whoever wants it most
15	uc1	I suggested that, but it was rejected.\nIt doesn't benefit us.
16	uc1	Tulgrim from the survey branch's\npretty stubborn about this stuff, so\nthere's not much way around it.
17	uc1	Hmmm... Not sure we can\njust give it away for free.
18	uc1	I made a similar suggestion, but\nthe sergeant shot it right down.
19	uc1	She's not cruel, but she's very...\nby the book, shall we say.
20	uc1	Unless we got some kind of compensation,\nwe'd never get Tulgrim on board, not to\nmention captains like Sif.
21	uc1	If we can hammer out more concrete\ncriteria and narrow down the possible\nrecipient colonies...then maybe.
22	uc1	We really can't just be sitting on\nthis ether surplus, like you said.
23	4	It's a difficult problem, certainly.
24	6	How about narrowing it down\nto a nearby colony?
25		Which colony will you work with?
26		Work with Colony Tau
27		Work with Colony 4
28		Work with Colony 30
29	uc1	Colony Tau? We won't get anything\nout of trading with them. No good.
30	uc1	What kind of colony is Colony 4?\nI don't know much about them, myself.
31	uc1	Does it seem like the kind of colony\nthat can make a fair trade for ether?
32	uc1	Oh, they could probably pay us\nback for ether in Levnis tech.
33	5	Mate, you're never going to shift\nthat ether at this rate.
34	uc1	You need solid justifications if you\nwant to get approval and convince\nthe top brass to back you up.
35	uc1	If it's not a colony like 30 which\ncan pay us back in kind, we're\njust not going to get the OK.
36	3	What an utter faff.
37	uc1	I agree. Ideally, I'd like to be able\nto distribute it more widely.
38	uc1	But that's not really my job. And without\nany other bright ideas, I think we'll have\nto settle for this one.
39	5	Yeah, I'm the same way.
40	4	If you can get your ether's worth,\nthey'll agree to the plan, yes?
41	5	What are you thinking?
42		To get their ether's worth...
43		Distribute it free of charge.
44		Sell it directly.
45		Sell it through Nopon.
46	5	I can't think of much, aside\nfrom just giving it away.
47	6	Right? If you can't use it all,\nthen what does it matter?
48	3	Couldn't you just straight up\nsell the stuff?
49	uc1	Not a bad idea, but logistically,\nit'd be a pain to lug around.
50	3	Yeah, I guess it's hard to go selling it\nwithout creating a load of work...
51	4	There's only one way to ensure that\nyou get a fair price and avoid incurring\nextra work on your side.
52	uc1	And that is?
53	4	The Nopon who travel with the\ncaravans. You sell through them.
54	4	There's always demand for ether.\nTrading in it should net plenty of profit.
55	4	And you have the added benefit of\nutilizing the Nopon trade routes.
56	4	Colonies suffering from ether shortages are\nsure to be somewhere on their itinerary.
57	uc1	Oh, yeah...!
58	4	Talk to the Nopon - I'm sure they'll\nbe happy to buy from you. They won't\nhave any trouble selling it.
59	uc1	That's a great idea! We should do that!
60	2	This way Lambda gets to sell its ether,\nand ether-starved colonies get to buy\nit from Nopon.
61	1	But you're going to need to get some\nkind of approval for it, aren't you?
62	uc1	Yeah, I'll put the request in.
63	5	What, just like that?
64	uc1	It's better to get the ball\nrolling straight away.
65	uc1	First we have to open talks with the\nNopon. The merchants, preferably.
66	2	We can take care of that, if you want?
67	uc1	Would you?
68	2	Of course. No trouble.
69	uc1	There's a Nopon trader near the entrance\nto the colony. Thanks for this.
evt/nq/msg_nq210502t.json
0	@c1	What going on?\nWhy everyone all together?
1	4	There's something we'd like you\nto consider purchasing.
2	@c1	Meh? And what that?
3	4	Colony Lambda's surplus ether.
4	1	Specifically, we'd like you to buy the\nether Colony Lambda can't use, and\nsell it to other colonies.
5	@c1	Intriguing! Ether supply of\nColony Lambda very ample.
6	@c1	But it decision of Zoka, so you ask to Zoka.\nZoka settling accounts in area at moment.
7	@c1	Zoka will be around Ruins of Seebu\non Urayan Trail. She decide whether\npurchase is go-go or no-go.
8	1	OK, we'll ask.
evt/nq/msg_nq210503t.json
0	md1	Welcome, welcome.\nIs something you want?
1	1	No, we'd like to discuss a possible\nbusiness deal with you.
2	md1	Zoka much happy to talk business deal!\nSo, what friends bring for Zoka to sell?
3	4	The deal concerns\nColony Lambda's ether.
4	md1	Hmm... Zoka see now.
5	4	We'd like you to take it as far as possible,\nto as many other colonies as possible.
6	md1	That OK with friends?
7	md1	Sell price maybe higher if friends keep\nether to selves.
8	1	A lot of colonies are in need, so we'd\nlike to entrust it to your best caravan.
9	md1	Ah, Zoka get gist now. Is true that\nZoka network of associate spread\nto many colony.
10	md1	Is not much work if friends only\nwant to sell ether.
11	4	Much appreciated.\nNow, as to the specifics...
12	md1	Zoka leave details and price-naming\nto speccy-friend.
13	5	Are you sure that's fair?
14	md1	Zoka happy to buy at asking price of\nfriends. Zoka love nothing more in world\nthan to sell ether.
15	1	If you're OK with that,\nwe'd be very grateful.
16	md1	Is most funnest thing for Zoka,\nto sell ether in many place!
17	4	We're in your debt. Koji will be\nable to discuss the finer details\nof the deal with you.
18	md1	OK!\nZoka go later then!
19	4	We'll go and report back, then.
evt/nq/msg_nq210504f.json
0	uc1	Did you manage to talk to them?
1	1	It looks like Zoka's all for it.
2	uc1	Great news! Thanks!
3	uc1	I'm always amazed at how quickly the\nNopon Caravans can make decisions...
4	5	Err, considering we had to trudge all that way\nto speak with their boss, it wasn't all *that*\nquick, really...
5	uc1	No, that's still faster than anything\ngets done in Colony Lambda.
6	uc1	We're not at war any more. We need to\ntake care of our allies from now on.\nWe can't keep doing things this way.
7	3	Yeah, I dunno...
8	uc1	Lambda has to change. And\nthat time is rapidly approaching.
9	uc1	Living like this, tangled up in rules and\nbureaucracy, it's just not sustainable.
10	1	One thing at a time, Koji.
11	uc1	Yeah, sorry. Thanks, anyway.
12	uc1	I'll get the ether sorted out\nas fast as I can.
evt/nq/msg_nq210600s.json
0	5	Seems like a bloke named Varen's\nworking on some kind of prototype.
1	6	Yeah, and everyone's hoping it'll\nhelp boost Lambda's defense.
2	2	I wonder what it could be...
3	4	Surely not a new type of Auto-Lev...?
4	3	Why don't we just nip along and\nhave a gander? We've gotta have\nsome stake in this, right?
5	1	Yeah, I'd say so. Lambda's defense\nconcerns us too.
evt/nq/msg_nq210601t.json
0	tc1	Have you come to have a\nnose around at this as well?
1	4	...What are you talking about?
2	tc1	So you didn't come to look at\nthe sensor I've developed?
3	1	What does it do, exactly?
4	tc1	It reacts to enemy signatures.
5	tc1	This little thing's indispensable for putting\non a nice show of defensive power without\nhaving to rely on Auto-Levs.
6	4	It enables you to spot enemies without\nexpending manpower. Very clever.
7	tc1	I really want to get them installed all\nover the place. I don't suppose you'd\nbe up for helping?
8	2	Us?
9	6	Are you sure we can touch them?\nIt won't think we're enemies?
10	tc1	No need to worry on that front,\nthey can tell the difference.
11	5	So it's a bit like Kitty's Auto-Lev, yeah?
12	3	Yeah, go on then. We'll help you out.
13	tc1	Great. So, the first installation needs\ndoing on the Old Cliffside Way. Shall we?
evt/nq/msg_nq210602f.json
0	tc1	There aren't actually many roads between\nColony Lambda and Maktha Wildwood.
1	tc1	Which means that if we don't get\npeople out here in the event of an\nattack, we're in trouble.
2	4	Yes, you need to fortify this point.\nIf anything were to come through\nhere, you'd have a problem.
3	tc1	Right, so let's install one of the\nsensors around here.
4	tc1	No sign of any enemies right now.\nLet's move on to the next.
5	tc1	Next port of call is the Urayan Tunnels.
evt/nq/msg_nq210603f.json
0	6	This looks like another place\nenemy soldiers would like...
1	tc1	Installing it right inside the tunnels\nmight not be the best idea.
2	4	Agreed. It would be more beneficial\nhere, where Lambda could reach it\nat a moment's notice.
3	tc1	...Around here, yeah.
4	tc1	...And that's all in place.
5	1	Is there anywhere else\nyou want to put one?
6	tc1	Let me see...
7	3	...Hold up. Isn't there\na waterway around here?
8	tc1	There is, but why?
9	3	It's just that we came out from\nover there, so...what's to stop your\nenemies from doing the same?
10	tc1	Yeah... Good point. Let's go and\nput one up over there too, then.
11	2	All right.
evt/nq/msg_nq210604f.json
0	5	Here?
1	tc1	Hmmm... Yeah, here should be OK.
2	4	If they come via the waterways,\nit's better to focus on the shoals\nrather than where the water's deep.
3	4	In which case, this looks like a suitable\nplace. There are Auto-Levs nearby too.\nYes, this seems like a no-brainer.
4	3	And lo, our tactician has spoken!
5	4	What? Surely this is blindingly obvious!
6	tc1	Then it's decided! Here it shall go!
7	tc1	And that's all of them.
8	4	Now you just need to keep\nan eye on them regularly.
9	1	Right. Colony Lambda's invested\nso much in its defense that-
10	tc1	Huh, got a message coming in.
11	tc1	Uh-huh... Yeah, I hear you...\n...And that's on the Old Cliffside Way?
12	1	What's happened?
13	tc1	Just a little wrinkle. They want\nme up at the Old Cliffside Way.
14	1	Is the sensor OK?
15	tc1	Not sure. That's what I'm\nhoping to find out.
16	4	We'll go with you. We've\ncome this far already.
17	tc1	I'm glad to hear it.
evt/nq/msg_nq210605f.json
0	tc1	Sarge?
1	xc1	Did you install this?
2	tc1	Er...yeah.
3	tc1	I'm sure you're aware, but Sergeant\nTonya heads an assault troop. They're\nthe best of the best.
4	xc1	You cannot put these things up without\nthe requisite approval from the top.
5	xc1	I'm sorry about this, but you're\ngoing to have to take them all down.
6	tc1	Oh, what?!
7	xc1	You engineers are always disrupting the\nsystem because you just go on ahead and\ndo what you please without ever asking.
8	xc1	You don't get to get special treatment,\nyou hear? All requests must be made\nthrough the proper channels.
9	tc1	Well, perhaps...
10	5	What, you're just gonna back down?\nYou're gonna let her talk to you like that?
11	tc1	She's a stickler for the rules. And she\ndoesn't get on with engineering because\nwe work outside those rules.
12	tc1	She won't listen to me,\nno matter what I say.
13	1	But someday Lambda might be\nglad to have these sensors.
14	xc1	Oh, they're useful, I fully agree.\nAnd that's exactly why you need to\nget the proper approvals.
15	wc1	Hey, now hold on a minute, Tonya.
16	xc1	Captain? Is there something\nI can do for you?
17	tc1	Captain Rosh supervises the troops.\nSergeant Tonya reports in to him.
18	wc1	A request just came in from the\nengineers. You weren't around,\nso I approved it in your place.
19	xc1	If that's your decision, then of course\nI shan't be the one to gainsay-
20	wc1	I'm just trying to make your life easier.\nYour love of the job is admirable, but\nbeing too rigid is a problem of its own.
21	xc1	Captain, you're too soft. If you can't\nkeep the soldiers disciplined, then-
22	wc1	My word is final. Anyway, everyone's\nticked the right boxes and got the right\nstamps, so we can all go home.
23	tc1	Thanks for that, Captain.
24	xc1	Captain, I'm not done yet.\nI ask that you stay behind.
25	wc1	Oof. I think you're taking this\na touch too seriously...
evt/nq/msg_nq210606t.json
0	tc1	Sorry about all that... Didn't mean\nto get you caught up in it as well.
1	tc1	If the captain hadn't come along at\njust that moment, the whole project\nwould have been torn down.
2	tc1	That's what happens when you\ndon't get your forms in on time...
3	1	Even things that the colony needs have\nto go through the proper channels, eh?
4	4	Colony Lambda's ability to enforce order\nthrough its regulations has always been\none of its strong points.
5	4	Yet somewhere along the way it became\nbogged down in needless protocols.
6	3	I mean, I get why they'd have this\napproval system. It makes it easy\nto know who's responsible for what.
7	4	That sort of leadership can even stand\nagainst Silver colonies in wartime.
8	4	But now that they've been released\nfrom any need to fight, those regulations\nbecome shackles, confusing everyone.
9	4	Colony Lambda's standing at a crossroads\nright now. Should they change...or not?
evt/nq/msg_nq210700s.json
0	1	Lambda's been talking about\nthat off-seer, Shijima.
1	4	Yes, I heard. It's true, then?\nHe's really...
2	2	Yes...
3	6	I wonder how he felt at...\nat the end.
4	5	You can never really know, can you?\nBut I bet he was proper living it up.
5	3	Hey, whatever happened to\nthat other off-seer?
6	1	Yeah, I hope Moraine's doing OK.
7	2	She must be feeling\npretty low after this...
8	4	Maybe we should go and look\nin on her. I don't know if there's\nanything we can do, but...
9	1	Yeah, let's pay her a visit.
evt/nq/msg_nq210701f.json
0	1	There you are, Moraine.
1	pc1	Oh, it's you... Is everything OK?
2	2	We heard about Shijima, and we were\njust wondering how you were doing.
3	pc1	Oh, you heard about that...\nYeah, Shijima passed away.
4	1	...
5	pc1	But you don't have to worry about me.\nIt was hard, but I'm doing fine now.
6	6	Wow, you're so strong, Moraine.
7	pc1	I think I understood everything he\nwanted to pass on, and I'll do my\nbest to keep his legacy alive.
8	pc1	After we came back with you, we had\na long chat, just the two of us. Talked out\na lot of stuff. He looked really...content.
9	pc1	So, thanks for everything you did.
10	2	No, we hardly did anything.
11	3	If he died peacefully, then that\nwas all your doing, Moraine.
12	pc1	But it did make me worry\nabout Colony Lambda a bit.
13	5	Worry? How's that?
14	pc1	We're a well-regulated colony, but it takes\ntime and effort to put in requests and get\npermission for anything you want to do.
15	pc1	He seemed to be uneasy about how\nmuch that slows everything down.
16	4	...I understand, yes. Those rules have\nmanaged to keep the colony running\nwell enough, but...
17	1	The colony's combination of talented\nindividuals and strong leadership is what\nled it to the top of the rankings.
18	5	Listen, I get that everything takes\nan age to get done, but listen-
19	xc1	Got a second, Moraine?
20	pc1	Well, well. If you're paying me\na visit, this must be important.
21	xc1	Just because we're in the same cohort\ndoesn't mean we have to be best friends.
22	pc1	Sure. So? What's going on?
23	xc1	Agnus forces are approaching\nColony Lambda.
24	xc1	We don't have concrete numbers, but\nthe sensors haven't registered anything\nso they're probably coming by air.
25	xc1	We've sent a recon team headed\nby Captain Rosh, so we're hoping\nto intercept them soon.
26	3	That's...not great...
27	xc1	Not at all. Quite a bit worse, in fact, given\nthat half the colony's still being rebuilt.
28	xc1	We're mobilizing everyone.\nYou too, Moraine.
29	pc1	I'll be there.
30	1	In that case, we'll come too.
31	xc1	That would be appreciated. I have more\nsquads to talk to, so go to the captain and\nhe'll send you where you're needed.
evt/nq/msg_nq210702f.json
0	wc1	Tonya tells me you're going to give us\na hand as well? Sorry to drag you into\nour business.
1	6	It's not like we could just\nlet you handle it alone!
2	wc1	Well I'm happy to hear it.
3	vc1	Looks like everyone's here.\nLet's crack on with the briefing.
4	vc1	Squad captains have all the particulars.\nWe'll run through the broad strokes of the\nstrategy here, so pay attention.
5	vc1	They likely have considerable numbers\nand firepower. And Lambda's not exactly\nat the height of its powers.
6	rc1	How accurate is our data on the enemy?
7	vc1	Koji verified their firepower, and it lines\nup with the recon team's intel.
8	rc1	Well, if Koji says so,\nI'm not going to argue.
9	vc1	We've already posted defensive\nsquads. They should be able to\nconfirm the numbers.
10	5	Can you afford to do that?\nThey're pretty much knocking\non your door, aren't they?
11	4	Tulgrim's the tactician, and\nhe's focusing on defense.
12	4	That doesn't mean just sitting and taking\neverything that's thrown at them.
13	4	The idea is to fragment the enemy\nwith each clash and stall them.
14	4	And in this kind of combat, how\nmuch intel you have on the enemy\nis of vital importance.
15	1	Yeah, it goes without saying that you\nneed to know the likely movements\nand size of the enemy's forces.
16	4	Exactly.
17	vc1	I'm thinking of deploying some Auto-Levs\nas well, keep them up top.
18	4	Good plan. Basic strategy dictates that you\nshould put them in locations which would\nbe difficult for soldiers alone to defend.
19	vc1	Right. Let's do it, then.\nAll squads, prepare for battle.
20	5	Guess that means us too.
evt/nq/msg_nq210703f.json
0	xc1	You did come after all.
1	1	Yep. You're preparing for\nAgnus's attack?
2	xc1	We certainly are. Not far from now,\nwe're going to be marching out there,\nsurrounded by furious enemies.
3	xc1	We're being stationed near the\nwaterfall entrance. Are you with us?
4	1	Yeah, we'll stick with you.
5	xc1	Then let's get to the waterfall entrance\nand stage a counterattack.
evt/nq/msg_nq210704f.json
0	5	Here they come!
1	6	Hey, no fair! They're early!
2	2	No point crying over that now!
3	1	Let's go!
evt/nq/msg_nq210705f.json
0	wc1	Good thing you were here.\nSorry to put you out, though.
1	5	Mate, that's what we're here for.\nIt's the least we could do.
2	wc1	Yeah, reckon you're right. Anyway.
3	wc1	We took care of the vanguard,\nbut the second wave is on its way.
4	3	There's bound to be a lot of 'em.\nAgnus don't do things by halves.
5	wc1	Normally, we could fend off an\nassault like this no problem.
6	wc1	But unfortunately for us, we've\ngot a number of squads barely\neven hanging on right now.
7	6	Then we've gotta help 'em out,\nno question!
8	wc1	No, you take five in the canteen.\nSupport us in the next one, will you?
9	4	Are you sure?
10	wc1	Yes, I'm sure. I'm getting comms from\nall other squads too. I need to react to\nthem at a moment's notice.
11	4	So this demands your full attention...
12	wc1	OK, see you on the other side.
13	1	Something worrying you, Taion?
14	4	...Yes. But first, let's get to the canteen.
evt/nq/msg_nq210706f.json
0	5	Yeah, so what happened with the\nAuto-Levs in the end?
1	4	I heard people discussing it on the road.\nThere's only one left, apparently, and it's\ndefending the upper level.
2	3	Hey, it's Moraine.
3	2	I hope she doesn't push herself too hard...
4	1	Lambda's all about cooperative effort.\nAnd they're well run.
5	1	Agnus may have the numbers,\nbut I can't imagine they'll be that\ntough an opponent.
6	4	Absolutely, Lambda's cohesion and firm\nleadership is a force to be reckoned with.
7	4	But there's an odd...fatigue\nabout the colony right now.
8	4	I don't know if they're just exhausted by\nthe work that the broken Flame Clock\nbrought on, or if it's something else.
9	4	Perhaps the combat and supply units\naren't quite working in concord.
10	1	Ah, yeah. They have been trying\nto find a niche outside war. Fixing\nAuto-Levs, ether mining, all that...
11	4	Right. And all of those little things\nbuild up into stress.
12	4	There's a lot more to worry about,\nbut it's all moot if we can't win this\nbattle now.
13	1	Yeah. Let's see what we\ncan do on that front, then.
evt/nq/msg_nq210707f.json
0	4	What's the situation?
1	wc1	Must say, I'm happy to see your smiling\nfaces. Enemy's nearly upon us, coming\nfrom up top.
2	1	Up top...?
3	wc1	Got to muster other units\nfor a counterattack.
4	4	Rosh, wait.\nHold your course straight ahead.
5	wc1	What?
6	4	It doesn't make sense for the\nAgnian army to hold the top at\nthis point in the fight.
7	4	If they were going to do that,\nthey would have created a diversion\nright away and attacked here.
8	4	Yet they've hardly dented our forces.\nThey're not going to risk everything\non a gamble now.
9	wc1	Good eye, lad.\nSo, what's the conclusion?
10	4	My guess is that they're trying to\nstrategically tie down our forces on\nthe upper level.
11	wc1	It's a convincing argument.\nI'll shore up our weakest points.
12	5	That's the captain for you.\nLightning-fast decisions, bam.
13	wc1	Ha. I know I get a bad rap, but I do\nknow how to lead a combat unit.
14	4	We'll push through to the top.\nIf there's an Auto-Lev posted up\nthere too, it'll be a cakewalk.
15	1	OK, this is it, everyone. Let's go!
evt/nq/msg_nq210708f.json
0	2	...I think that was the last of them.
1	3	How many was that, even? Must've\nsent the whole of Agnus over here!
2	5	Should probably find someone\nto report to at some point.
3	1	Yeah. Shall we go to the\nCommander's Office?
4	4	...I can't help wondering why\nthey targeted Colony Lambda.
5	2	What do you mean, Taion?
6	4	I just don't understand why you'd go to\nthe trouble of actively attacking a colony\nas defensively strong as Colony Lambda.
7	6	Maybe they wanted the ether?
8	4	Not impossible.\nBut then why attack by air?
9	5	You're overthinking it, mate. They just\ndecided to use Levnises, that's all.
10	4	I certainly hope that's all.
evt/nq/msg_nq210709f.json
0	A	I'd like to thank you all for your efforts in\ndefending the colony. We've confirmed the\nretreat and defeat of all enemy forces.
1	wc1	You can all take it easy\nfor the rest of the day.
2	wc1	Tulgrim, would you mind staying\nbehind with the commander and me?
3	vc1	...Yessir.
4	wc1	We need to look into their intended\ntargets, and how they got here.
5	uc1	No need, Captain.
6	wc1	Koji?
7	uc1	I brought them.
8	vc1	You did WHAT?!
9	uc1	You knew that already, though, didn't\nyou? They came by air because they\nknew about our sensor system.
10	uc1	I told them where Lambda's\ndefenses were weakest.
11	uc1	And I passed the information\nto them via the Nopon Caravan.
12	wc1	What are you talking about? Do you\nhave any idea what you're saying?
13	wc1	Koji, you'll be put in solitary for this.
14	vc1	I get that everyone's worn out, but\nthis isn't the time or place for jokes.\nGo and sleep it off.
15	uc1	From where I'm standing, quick reaction\non our part would have avoided the\nAuto-Levs from being wasted.
16	uc1	But Lambda isn't capable\nof that right now.
17	uc1	If the Ouroboros hadn't been here,\nwe would have crumbled!
18	uc1	You can excel in tactics, you can fight\nimpressive battles, but you still end up\non the losing end!
19	uc1	If we can't react flexibly when we're\nthreatened, then that's fatal to us as\na colony.
20	A	You're probably right.
21	uc1	Colony Lambda needs to change.\nIf we can't, we die!
22	uc1	I'm not...I'm not going to roll over\nand die cowering from the future,\nlike Shijima when he ran off.
23	uc1	And I know you won't either, Captain!
24	wc1	...Take him away.
25	vc1	B-but-
26	uc1	We can't leave things this way!\nColony Lambda can't survive like this\nand you know it!
27	A	I'm sorry you had to see that.
28	1	N-no, we just...
29	A	Koji's words are reasonable. We're\nall keenly aware of our situation.
30	4	In that case, maybe change\nisn't impossible.
31	A	Think of discipline as a protective armor.\nIt isn't easy to cast it off for freedom.\nEverything becomes a source of fear.
32	4	Commander...
33	A	Thank you for working with us on this.\nYou deserve a well-earned rest.
evt/nq/msg_nq210800s.json
0	5	Man. Lambda's the most hard-working\nbunch I've ever seen.
1	1	Exceptionally talented, too.\nIt's no wonder they held onto\ntheir rank for so long.
2	A	Which means that ending up in\na situation like the one we just had\nis entirely on my head.
3	3	You say that, but you can't please 'em all.\nSome people think it's all hunky-dory,\nsome don't. There's no right answer.
4	A	That's a very earnest observation, Eunie.
5	3	I'm a very earnest observer,\ndontcha know.
6	A	Colony Lambda was weak before we\nestablished the chain of command.
7	4	Right. The system was revised, the current\nstructure took shape, and Lambda became\na strong colony.
8	A	Strict discipline allowed us to broaden\nour strategies and strengthen our units.
9	2	But now those rules are\nstrangling the colony.
10	4	That doesn't change the fact that these\nformalities are what made Lambda strong\nin the first place.
11	4	And that's why they can't just tear down\nthe system that got them here, even when\nthey know it's inefficient.
12	1	...It's why Koji took the actions he did,\nto challenge that system.
13	A	I'm sure Koji was thinking of\nColony Lambda, in his own way.
14	6	Yeah, he had to be. I'm sure he only\nwanted what was best for the colony.
15	A	...Indeed.
16	A	As it happens, we've set up a place\nin the Commander's Office to discuss\nour next options with the captains.
17	A	Would you care to join us? We'd like\nas many ideas as we can on the table.
18	5	OK, let's have a shufti.
evt/nq/msg_nq210801f.json
0	vc1	Commander, you made it.\n...Oh. And you guys.
1	A	They're with me. Don't pay them any\nattention, let's just get this sorted.
2	wc1	OK, then let's start with the\nmanufacturing unit.
3	3	Not changed a bit, have they?
4	4	I feel they're on the right track,\nbut they can't quite shake the\nold ways just yet.
5	1	Lambda's a pretty great colony.\nThey won't lose sight of what they\nneed to do.
6	xc1	Excuse me, Commander,\nthere's something-
7	rc1	Tonya, please. We're in the\nmiddle of an inquiry here.
8	A	Let her speak.
9	xc1	We've found evidence of\ntrespassers in the colony.
10	A	...Are you sure?
11	vc1	Don't be ridiculous. After we've\njust been attacked by Agnus?
12	xc1	I'm afraid I... I didn't wait for approval.\nI put together a unit to tail them and\nsent them out at once.
13	wc1	Asking forgiveness instead of\npermission? How unlike you, Tonya.
14	A	You did the right thing in not\nwaiting to act. Use your best\njudgment in this matter.
15	vc1	Yessir! All right. Captain Rosh,\nSergeant Tonya, come with me.
16	wc1	Will do. Come along, Tonya.
17	A	It seems we'll have to put our talk\non the back burner for now.
18	4	Nothing to be done about that. This\ntrespassing matter is more urgent.
19	A	It is, rather. No idea where they've come\nfrom. I don't suppose you'd be willing to\nhelp us look into it?
20	2	There's no question of that.\nOf course we will.
21	rc1	Reach out to the engineers and survey\nbranch, see if they can pass us any info.
22	1	Roger that. We'll take care of it.
evt/nq/msg_nq210802t.json
0	xc1	Ouroboros... And Commander?!\nYou're here too?
1	A	Don't mind me, please continue.
2	xc1	Yes sir!
3	xc1	I just received a report confirming\nthe traces of trespass. We're combing\nthe area now.
4	xc1	Seems our unwanted guests are\nheading in the direction of the forest.
5	A	I can't imagine they'll slink\naway without trying something.
6	1	Footprints... We'll follow them.
7	xc1	OK. We'll merge with the detached\nforce, then. We're counting on you.
evt/nq/msg_nq210803f.json
0	6	The footsteps just...end.
1	5	What does it mean?
2	sc106sc10	Hey, you lot. Can you tell me\nyour position right now?
3	10300	We were following a set of footprints we\nthought might belong to the trespassers.
4	sc104sc10	If anything, they fled to\nLow Maktha Wildwood.
5	10300	How do you know that?
6	sc104sc10	I took the Auto-Lev out and had\na gander for the engineers.
7	4	You got approval for an Auto-Lev?
8	sc104sc10	Oh, the Auto-Lev is our pet project.\nWe don't need permission to use it.\nEr, don't tell the commander, though.
9	3	You know he's right here, don't you?
10	sc104sc10	Anyway, if you're after the trespassers,\ntry the Low Wildwood. Good hunting!
11	sc104sc10	Oh, right - message from\nTulgrim, before I forget.
12	sc104sc10	Analysis of the trespassers' behavior\nindicates they're probably up to something.
13	sc104sc10	So be on your guard if it\ncomes down to a fight, OK?
14	5	You're really just gonna let her use\nthat thing whenever she wants?
15	A	Nothing to worry about. I told her\nshe doesn't need my permission.
16	2	We can talk later. We have to\nget to the Low Wildwood.
17	5	Oh yeah, right!
evt/nq/msg_nq210804f.json
0	ae1	...Well, well, well, if it isn't Colony\nLambda and Isurd after all this time!
1	A	I know you...
2	ae1	We've got so much to\ncatch up on, you and I!
3	A	I thought we wiped you out,\nlast we met in battle.
4	be1	Our colony may have been destroyed\nby Auto-Levs and all those fancy toys,\nbut we survived.
5	be1	No, we couldn't die until we got\nour revenge on Colony Lambda!
6	5	Wait, they can't be...
7	A	They are. The best of Colony 13, come\nto finish their long vendetta with us.
8	ae1	We tried starting a new life in a\nnew colony, but it wasn't enough.\nIt couldn't quench our hatred!
9	ae1	You slaughtered our friends in Colony 13!
10	ae1	The thought of avenging them\nagainst you is the only thing that's\nkept our Flame Clocks ticking!
11	A	Of all the idiotic...! The friends we've lost,\nall because of your poisonous games...!
12	4	This is senseless. What point\nis there in letting your desire for\nrevenge consume you?
13	ce1	As if we care about that now!\nAll we want now is to wipe\nColony Lambda off the map!
14	5	No point talking to a brick wall.
15	ae1	You talk about our poison?\nWe'll show you poison!
evt/nq/msg_nq210805f.json
0	5	That's them gone.\nI'll be honest - it doesn't feel great.
1	4	...Mmm.
2	A	Still, we saw off the threat.\nThanks for your quick reflexes.
3	2	All we did was fight. Everyone\nin Lambda did the real work.
4	A	Haha, well said.\nI'll thank them.
5	A	Let's leave the clean-up to the team and\nget back to the Commander's Office.
evt/nq/msg_nq210806f.json
0	A	I know we've been lurching from crisis\nto crisis lately, but I want to thank you\nfor your teamwork.
1	A	You all managed to pull your own\nweight, and I'm thoroughly impressed.
2	wc1	Guess so.\nWe didn't have much alternative.
3	xc1	It was that or end up in\neven more dire straits.
4	xc1	As Captain Rosh said, there wasn't\nmuch else we could do. We had to\nact for the sake of the colony.
5	vc1	I'm the one who forestalled\nthe orders. If there's a punishment\nto be borne, I'll bear it.
6	A	I'm not accusing any of you of\nanything. I'm proud of you all,\nactually, for thinking on your feet.
7	5	Call them nerds all you want,\nbut they can walk the walk.
8	3	Eh, not how I'd phrase it,\nbut I'm with you.
9	sc1	It sounds pretty spineless, but I think\nwe gave up on thinking for ourselves.
10	sc1	...Maybe we just didn't want to be\nresponsible, even for the important stuff.
11	xc1	...Koji's actions have\nreally shaken things up.
12	A	...It's not a bad thing,\nto advocate for change.
13	A	We're going to make mistakes from time\nto time, but your decisions and actions\nare what will lead us to a new future.
14	4	I wonder if the commander was quietly\nwaiting for this opportunity to arise...
15	A	If I keep on barking orders and enforcing\nrules, then, ultimately, nothing's going\nto change.
16	A	If you want to change, you have to do it\nyourself. You all realized that, and that's\nwhy you were able to act as you did.
17	pc1	Koji realized it before any of us.\nAnd he acted on it.
18	pc1	Commander, can't we bring Koji back?
19	A	...
20	sc1	I agree. If we can...
21	A	Is that your collective opinion?
22	vc1	His actions were wrong, no doubt. But it\nwas Koji's words that kicked all of this off.\nI don't think anyone doubts that either.
23	wc1	...I can't deny it. We need to work\ntogether towards this new future.
24	wc1	And we'll need his help for that.
25	A	...I see.
26	A	That's settled, then. As of now, Koji\ncan return to active duty, albeit\nstripped of his former position.
27	A	He will, however, remain under close\nsurveillance. Such behavior warrants\nharsh punishment.
28	4	Colony Lambda's changing...
29	1	Let's see how it goes.
30	A	This is all thanks to you.
31	4	Not at all. You... No, the people\nof Colony Lambda managed this.
32	4	You keep doing what you do, and\nI know you'll make something great.
33	A	Oh, I intend to set it on the right path,\nyes. But the colony will continue to grow,\nby my hand or not...
evt/nq/msg_nq220100s.json
0	1	Colony Tau doesn't have\nany off-seers, does it?
1	L	No. We return our dead to the earth.
2	5	Weird thing to do. I never heard\nof anyone doing that.
3	L	Who grows up in the forest, goes back\nto the forest. And until that time comes,\na peaceful resting place awaits you.
4	4	I'm from Agnus and even I've never heard\nof this custom. I suppose it's deeply rooted\nin Colony Tau's culture.
5	L	It is. Which is why the concept of\n"sending off" isn't something we've\never had to consider.
6	2	But...you did have an off-seer in the past,\nfrom what I've heard?
7	L	In the past, yes. But he was\nkilled in combat with Keves.
8	3	Were you there, Juniper?
9	L	I was. He drew enemy fire with the\nrear guard. I would not have escaped,\nwere it not for his sacrifice.
10	3	Well that's depressing.
11	5	But what did your off-seer usually do,\ngiven that he wouldn't be off-seeing?
12	L	Tilled the fields, mostly. As I said,\nwe didn't really need off-seers.
13	3	Still depressing.
14	L	...Actually, could I ask you\nto send off our off-seer?
15	1	Of course, if that's what you want.
16	L	If there is a place we return to,\nthen surely there are avenues\nother than the earth to reach it.
17	L	That's what I've come to believe, anyway.\nYou know, if there really is some peaceful\nplace waiting somewhere...
18	2	That's a lovely thought.
19	1	Do you know where the off-seer is?\nWe'll get there straight away.
20	L	Thanks. I'll take you.
evt/nq/msg_nq220101f.json
0	1	Is this where the fight was?
1	L	Yes, the battle was around here.\nWe were outnumbered.
2	L	We managed to hold our own at first,\nleveraging our advantages, but...you\ncan't argue with numbers, in the end.
3	L	The rear guard's actions saved\nso many of us. Even so...
4	4	There's no way out once you've\nbeen cornered in a place like this.
5	5	Looks like the monsters have made\nthemselves at home here now.
6	1	We can't do any sending off like this.
7	2	Let's get rid of them before\nthey become a problem, then.
8	L	Hm? Oh...yes, of course.\nThat sounds good.
9	3	Come on, where's your energy?\n"Let's whoop their arses!" Lemme\nhear you say it!
10	L	Er. Let's, uh...smack their behinds!
11	5	Eh, close enough. Let's go!
evt/nq/msg_nq220102f.json
0	1	I think we should be able\nto send them now.
1	L	There were so many monsters here.\nI wouldn't have been able to clear them\nall out without your help. Thank you.
2	2	OK, let's begin.
3	2	Oh, we've been here before.
4	1	I remember. We already sent them off.
5	L	You did? Well, you have my thanks, then.\nAnd for someone you didn't even know...
evt/nq/msg_nq220103f.json
0	dd1	Aha, so that light was you.
1	Yd1	We thought it might have\nbeen a sending-off.
2	dd1	It looked so...soft and gentle.
3	dd1	What did you come here for?
4	Yd1	Wait... You did it for us?
5	Yd1	I'm sorry you had to do that.\nBut perhaps now...
6	L	Yeah. They can all rest easily now.
7	Yd1	The old commander died here too,\nand was left where he fell.
8	1	Oh, really?
9	L	He was the first to fall.
10	Yd1	He's the one who promoted\nJuniper, and ensured our new\ncommander's escape.
11	L	He was so strong and kind.\nI idolized him.
12	Yd1	He was always thinking of the colony.\nHe helped Juniper get to safety and\nfought to the bitter end.
13	1	So he promoted you to commander...\nUnusual, but given the circumstances\nI can see why.
14	2	Yes, you carry on his legacy...\nI think that's a wonderful thing.
15	L	Our off-seer at the time understood\nhow we operated. He worked hard\nto make himself useful.
16	L	He was very gentle, that off-seer.\nMuch like Graziana in that respect.
17	dd1	...Did you just call me gentle?
18	L	And Cardamine may be rough around the\nedges, but he takes his duties seriously.\nJust like the old commander.
19	L	We all inherited something of\nthe commander. The whole of\nColony Tau...
20	dd1	We can see him in your strength\nand kindness too, Juniper.
21	Yd1	That's why he named you his successor,\nand fought so hard to protect the colony\nyou'd inherit.
22	L	Yes...I suppose you're right.
23	L	But after meeting Noah and the\nothers, I see there's still so much\nmore we could change.
24	L	We have to look for new trails to blaze,\ninstead of stagnating as we are.
25	1	We'll help as much as we can, too.
26	dd1	Whatever choice you take, Commander,\nwe'll follow. We believe in you.
27	L	That's good to hear. Thank you.
28	L	We'll all have to band together to\nbuild a new Tau. And we'll make\nour late friends proud.

evt/nq/msg_nq220200s.json
0	5	So, is harvest time a\nbig deal for your lot?
1	L	It is, yes. We grow virtually all\nour own food in the colony.
2	L	We can't sustain ourselves\non hunting alone, you know?
3	1	What's the harvest festival\nall about, then?
4	L	Nothing special, just a harvest, really.\nWe have a lot of crops to bring in at\nthis time of year.
5	L	The only problem is we're a bit\nshort-handed this year. People are\nbraced for hard work.
6	2	Can we be of any use?
7	6	It's just harvesting, right?\nI can do harvesting!
8	L	Would you? It would\ndelay your journey...
9	3	Ah ah ah! This is the part where you\njust thank us graciously and move on.
10	2	Eunie's right.
11	L	OK, then, thank you.\nI'd be grateful for your help.
12	5	Arright, let's get harvesting!
13	L	Everyone will be waiting by\nthe entrance to Colony Tau.
evt/nq/msg_nq220201f.json
0	L	As a colony we're mostly self-sufficient,\nso we need arable land.
1	4	Enabling you to grow your own food\nwithout having to forage. Good thinking.
2	Xd1	Juniper-! Oh, you've brought friends.
3	1	We've come to help with the harvest.\nDo you need a hand with anything?
4	ed1	Oh, are you serious? Yes, sure,\nthere's plenty of work going around.
5	Xd1	Glory, don't just-
6	ed1	I'd accept a Tirkin's help\nright now, so they're in.
7	L	Carson and Glory are in charge of\nassigning the work in the fields.
8	ed1	It's better for me to be nearby,\ngiven the injuries coming in.
9	5	Injuries?! Who'd have thought farming\ncould be so dangerous?
10	ed1	Don't be dense. There's\nalways danger in the forest.
11	Xd1	So how about it? Still willing?
12	1	Of course. Just tell us\nwhat you need from us.
13	Xd1	In that case, how do you feel\nabout digging up potatoes?
14	3	Spud patrol. Got it.
15	Xd1	Thanks. Shouldn't take\nlong if you all pitch in.
evt/nq/msg_nq220202f.json

1	1	This is hard work...
2	2	I can't believe how many there are...
3	2	That should be us.
4	3	These little guys, eh?
5	3	Come to Eunie!
6	4	There's quite a number of them...
7	4	Not as easy as it looks.
8	5	So I just yank 'em all out?
9	5	Well, that's them picked!
10	6	Wow. There's so many!
11	6	Yay! You're all mine, potatoes!
evt/nq/msg_nq220203f.json
0	1	Here are some potatoes.
1	1	And done!
2	2	There's quite a few, huh?
3	2	More for the harvest!
4	3	Let's pick these beauties!
5	3	How's that?
6	4	This is hard on the knees...
7	4	Well, they're out of the ground.
8	5	Look at all these!
9	5	I'm gonna feel this in the morning...
10	6	I spy potatoes!
11	6	Got a big one!
evt/nq/msg_nq220204f.json
0	1	Let me just dig this up...
1	1	Not bad, if I do say so myself.
2	2	So, we have to dig here then, right?
3	2	Perfect!
4	3	You leave all those taters to me.
5	3	That should be enough, right?
6	4	There should be some around here.
7	4	Am I done now?
8	5	Let's get diggin'.
9	5	Not bad, eh? Eh?
10	6	Time to roll up the ol' sleeves!
11	6	I think I'm pretty good at this!
evt/nq/msg_nq220205f.json
0	5	Hey, we're done with the harvest...\nEr, what's going on?
1	Xd1	Shh! Quiet. They'll see you!
2	3	You wanna elaborate for us, love?
3	ed1	The monsters that have their greedy eyes\non our spuds. They're coming this way...
4	ed1	This happens every single time.\nThe amount of collateral damage\nthey've caused, I swear...
5	4	I did wonder what harvesting methods\nyou were using to cause so many\ncasualties... This makes more sense.
6	L	We'd usually muster the whole colony to\ndrive them off, but this year we're short\nof people, so... Ugh, what do we do...?
7	2	Remember what Eunie said.\nJust thank us graciously. No\nneed to stand on ceremony.
8	L	...O-oh, right. Yes, sure.
9	1	And you'll be there too, Juniper, of course.\nNow, let's clear those monsters out.
10	L	Sounds like a plan!
evt/nq/msg_nq220206f.json
0	L	We took care of the\nmonsters in the vicinity.
1	Xd1	Glad to hear it. We wouldn't have\nbeen able to manage it so elegantly\non our own.
2	5	We can't just let 'em make off with\nyour treasured taters, now, can we?
3	ed1	You've got that right. We put our\nblood, sweat and tears into growing\nthose little spuds.
4	Xd1	Glory and the others aren't technically\nin charge of the fields, but they help out.
5	Xd1	When I see 'em all working so hard,\nthe thought of those monsters stealing\nour hard-earned crops makes me fume.
6	1	I bet. No one likes being robbed.
7	ed1	There's no need to stress over it.\nIf you overthink everything like Carson\nhere, any loss will be a big shock.
8	Xd1	Hey, c'mon now...
9	L	Anyway, the monsters are\nout of the picture. As far as\nI'm concerned, that's a win.
10	Xd1	You're right. Rowland will be pleased to\nstock up on more monster meat, too.
11	ed1	He's such a greedyguts. I'd rather he\nsharpen his sense of danger a bit more.
12	ed1	If he wants to eat, he has to work. Hard.
13	Xd1	But isn't that the exact opposite of...
14	ed1	Yes?
15	Xd1	Uh... Never mind.
16	L	(cough) Anyway, thank you\nvery much for your help.
17	3	Way to change the subject.
18	1	Leave it. We harvested the potatoes\nand there's no harm done - that's the\nimportant thing here.
19	5	True, that. All that's left is to eat\nthe fruits, or veg, of our labors.
20	L	We'll let you know when the grub's up.

0	2	Is Raine OK?
1	3	Seems like his injury's still not stopping\nhim diving headfirst into trouble.
2	L	He was a sworn friend of my predecessor,\nand he's a master hunter.
3	L	I understand your concern, but I believe\nhe can take care of himself.
4	5	So, he's a hunter too, eh?
5	L	He was my hunting teacher, for a while.
6	L	That said, I will say that he doesn't know\nwhen to stop chasing a monster...
7	1	That's not a good combination\nwith injury...
8	L	I know he's a capable guy, but it was\noverextending himself that got him hurt\nin the first place.
9	2	In that case, maybe we should go and look\nfor him. If it looks like he's being reckless,\nwe'll bring him back. Sound good?
10	L	Sounds great. Let's do it.

12	106bd10	Hey. Juniper's with you, right? Listen.
13	104bd10	Sorry for the short notice, Juniper, but\ncould you come and meet me sharpish?

2	bd1	Look! A Beaconstone!
3	L	Wait, but that's...
4	1	Juniper, what's that smoke?
5	L	It's a Beaconstone. We use them when we\ncan't get normal communication out. They\nrelease smoke to warn of danger...
6	6	Wait, so do you think...?
7	3	Looks like your man's in trouble.
8	bd1	Ugh, Raine... He said he'd go hunting to\nreplenish our lackluster food supplies.
9	L	OK. I'll follow the Beaconstone.\nGeum, you wait here.
10	bd1	But-
11	L	You still haven't fully recovered yourself,\nhave you? I'm not risking you too.
12	bd1	Understood...

1	_c1	You guys...? How did you...?
2	L	We saw your Beaconstone.\nBut you're hurt...
3	3	It's pretty bad.\nBut he'll be fine, I've got this.
4	_c1	I'm losing my...edge... Overestimated\nmyself... Thought I could...outdo you,\nJuniper...
5	3	Stop talking. These wounds won't\nclose up unless you hold still.
6	_c1	Sorry... Looks like the hunter...\ngot himself hunted...
7	_c1	That quarry...that monster... It was\na strange one. Felt off...dangerous.
8	L	I understand. Raine, you will\nrest now. That's an order.
9	_c1	I can hardly argue back in this\nsorry state... I'll be good...
10	1	Let's go monster-hunting.
evt/nq/msg_nq220303f.json

1	6	...There aren't any, huh.
2	2	Maybe it went down here.
3	L	Probably...
4	1	Should we follow?
5	L	No, if it's got away to the lower levels\nwe don't need to pursue it.
6	L	It won't be back here any time soon,\nand we'd be putting ourselves in great\ndanger down there.
7	1	OK.
8	5	Let's head back then, and\nmake sure Raine's OK.

3	_c1	Got to be on guard in case\nit rears its mug again.

6	ed1	Yes, it is that big a deal.\nDon't think you can charge\noff like a buffoon again.
7	_c1	Aww, Glory...
8	ed1	Juniper went to the trouble of going out\nto look for you, so you'd better behave\nwith a modicum of dignity.
9	_c1	Bah...
10	ed1	If you pull anything like this again\nI'll tie you to a tree.

1	L	Right. Food stocks are pretty\ntight at this time of year.
2	5	Is it really that rough?\nCoulda fooled me.
3	L	We're not exactly destitute. It's more\nabout our relationship with our neighbors...

3	L	I see.
4	cd1	Honestly, though, I'm more upset\nabout the prospect of losing my grub\nto those featherbrains! Hahahaha!
5	5	Huh...
6	cd1	It's such a longstanding tradition,\nI guess we've got to keep it up.
7	L	Hmm. I'd rather avoid forcing people to\nhand food over, if it's at all possible.
8	1	Will that be OK?
9	L	We've kept this up because it was\ntradition, but if it's giving the colony\na hard time, we might have to end it.
10	cd1	I'm fine either way.\nYour decision, Juniper.
11	cd1	If you want to keep this Tirkin alliance up,\nthen we'll need a hand raising the supplies.
12	cd1	I'm looking for Green Nectarines,\nTirkingrass...
13	cd1	...Shiny Roses and Glare Aubergines.\nFifty of each, if you please.
14	cd1	They like it fresh, too, so keep their\nperishability in mind when you decide\nwhat to forage first!
15	cd1	If you want to end the alliance, you'd\nbetter go and talk to the Tirkins directly.
16	L	Makes sense. I'll give it some thought.
17	cd1	As I said, it's your decision. I've got\nsome food stocked in here, remember,\nso don't hesitate to give me a shout.

3	1	That's a bit alarming.
4	L	Imogen's not the type to do anything\nirregular, so it's unsettling that she\nwouldn't get in contact with us.
5	2	Where did she go again?
6	L	Colony 4.
7	1	Do you know why she went there?
8	L	I don't, actually. All I know is that\nshe was very dead-set on it.
9	2	Hmm... In that case, would it be\nworth going to look for her?
10	4	Colony 4 are an upstanding bunch,\nso I don't expect that anything bad\nwill have happened. Still...
11	L	Let's go anyway, and\nfind out from Imogen herself.
evt/nq/msg_nq220501f.json
0	1	That's odd.\nNo sign of Imogen anywhere.
1	L	She definitely said she was\ngoing to Colony 4...
2	4	Have you tried getting\nin touch with her?
3	L	I've tried a few times,\nbut she never picks up.
4	6	Do you think she got\ncaught up in something?
5	4	I don't get that impression.
6	4	If she had, then it would be\nunusual for everyone to be acting\nso normally in Colony 4.
7	2	You're right about that.
8	L	If she's gone outside the colony, it's\ngoing to be a challenge to find her.
9	1	I think all we can do\nis ask around here.
evt/nq/msg_nq220502t.json
0	L	We're looking for a Colony Tau\nsoldier, name of Imogen. Can you\ntell us anything about her?
1	wZ1	Meh? Imogen, friend say?
2	1	Right. No one's been able to get in\ntouch with her, so we're a bit worried.
3	wZ1	She look very pondering, but\nKukucha not talk with her.
4	L	I see... Well, thanks anyway.
5	wZ1	Sorry Kukucha not more helping!
evt/nq/msg_nq220503t.json
0	L	Hello, sorry, we're looking for\na soldier called Imogen. Do you\nknow anything about her?
1	yZ1	This is a bit random. Imogen?
2	5	Yeah, she's s'posed to have\ncome to Colony 4, but no one's\nbeen able to reach her.
3	yZ1	She's from Agnus, isn't she? I know\nshe arrived here a short while ago.
4	yZ1	Not sure where she is now, though.
5	L	Oh...
6	yZ1	Now you mention it, she\ncame asking the same thing.
7	2	You mean...
8	yZ1	She was looking for someone.
9	1	Any idea who?
10	yZ1	I have my suspicions, actually.\nBut I can't say any more about it.
11	6	Whuh? Why not?
12	yZ1	I just can't. I'm sorry, but\nthat's about all I can tell you.
13	L	Well, all right. Thanks for your help.
evt/nq/msg_nq220504t.json
0	@Z1	Hello, all. And hello to your Agnus friend.
1	L	I'm actually looking for someone.\nDo you know an Imogen?
2	@Z1	Imogen? Yes, she came\nfrom Colony Tau, I think.
3	6	So you know her?
4	@Z1	I wouldn't say we're particularly\nwell acquainted, but...
5	@Z1	She was a bit suspicious.
6	L	Suspicious? That's not\nthe Imogen I know...
7	@Z1	She always seemed to be looking for\nsomething, sniffing around the procurement\ndivision and the tactician squad.
8	@Z1	That said, she looked a little too\nconspicuous to be a spy.
9	L	...Interesting. OK, thanks for your help.
evt/nq/msg_nq220505t.json
0	L	Excuse me...
1	Xa1	What's this now? We don't\nget many visitors here.
2	2	Does the name Imogen mean anything\nto you? We're trying to find her.
3	Xa1	Imogen? Yeah, I remember her. She\ncame in once to look at the Levnises.\nStrange look in her eyes.
4	L	You know her?!
5	Xa1	Cheerful as a corpse, that one.\nI told her not to come in here looking\nso grim, and sent her packing.
6	1	I...I see.
7	Xa1	There's an old battleground nearby, so I\ntold her to go and straighten herself out a\nbit. Reminded her that there's a war on.
8	L	Thank you for the information.
evt/nq/msg_nq220506s.json
0	5	OK, I'm lost.\nSo where did Imogen go?
1	6	We know she was definitely\nin Colony 4 at some point...
2	4	This is only speculation, but I think\nImogen's looking for someone\nworking outside the colony.
3	4	Oleshandra from the medic team and\nSolon of the procurement division have\nboth been known to work further afield.
4	2	But it doesn't look like she-
5	L	I think I have an idea.\nJust a little one, but still.
6	L	Imogen was still a bit hung up\nwhen the colony was freed.
7	1	Hung up? On what, exactly?
8	L	She had a friend who was killed\nin a battle with another colony.
9	L	A really close friend.
10	4	So you think she might be searching\nfor whoever killed her friend?
11	2	But why focus on Colony 4?
12	L	No idea. We weren't fighting\nColony 4 back then.
13	4	But if the colony you were fighting was\ndestroyed and its soldiers reassigned...
14	2	Maybe she heard something about it\nfrom one of the Nopon Caravans and\nset off to track them down?
15	4	It's possible, but we can't\nsay much more than that.
16	6	So...this is about revenge?
17	5	Spark me...
18	L	She wouldn't...
19	3	We're at kind of a loose end here,\nanyhow. Where in the Queen's royal\nrobes could she be?
20	1	We heard that she'd been sent to that\nbattlefield. We may as well search\nalong that way. What do you say?
21	L	...Mm, let's. I hope she hasn't\ngone and done anything stupid.
evt/nq/msg_nq220507t.json
0	L	Imogen!
1	ad1	...Juniper? What are you doing here?
2	L	That's what I want to know!\nWhat's going on here? Why\nhaven't you been in contact?
3	ad1	Sorry, I lost track of time.
4	5	This your idea of a nice\nday out or something?
5	ad1	No, not really...\nI'm not doing anything out here.
6	L	What do you mean by that?
7	ad1	I came searching for whoever...\nwhoever killed...
8	L	It's OK, I know.
9	ad1	But there was no one left to find. He died\nsoon after he was reassigned here.
10	ad1	This is all that's left to even\nshow there was a battle here...
11	1	Were you going to avenge your friend?
12	ad1	No.
13	ad1	When the Flame Clock was broken, for\nsome reason I saw my friend's face.
14	ad1	And also their killer's...
15	6	It's the worst feeling, isn't it?
16	ad1	I started to wonder what the killer\nwas doing with his life. I wanted\nto meet him. Just once.
17	ad1	But...it was too late. Everyone in Colony 4\nsaid he'd fought bravely for his friends...
18	L	So you couldn't get\nthe closure you needed.
19	ad1	I didn't get to meet him.
20	ad1	But I kind of feel better about it all.
21	ad1	He was fighting for something too.
22	ad1	He was our enemy and I hated him\nso much, but he was still just a soldier,\nwith friends he cared for.
23	L	You're right. And those feelings of\nfriendship are something we hold\nonto as well.
24	ad1	I'm sorry I made you come all this way.
25	L	Shall we go back to Tau?
26	ad1	Not yet. I think I want\nto stay here a bit longer.
27	ad1	Colony 4 would have considered me an\nenemy at one time, but they've treated\nme so kindly.
28	ad1	I want to learn from them\nbefore I go back.
29	L	Got it. I think it'll be a\ngood experience for you.
30	L	But please, please,\nplease keep in touch, OK?
31	ad1	I will. Thanks, Juniper.\nAnd you, too.
evt/nq/msg_nq220508t.json
0	Yd1	Hmm, no word from Imogen.

0	2	Everyone's commenting on how\nColony Tau's gained a few Nopon!
1	XW1	Nopon are everyplace!
2	tV	It true! Nopon very hardy people.
3	1	The locals are a bit afraid of them, it\nseems. I can't say I'd call any Nopon\nI've ever met "scary"...
4	L	If Honorine invited them,\nI'm sure they can't be bad...
5	5	Stuffing their faces, eh? And here I thought\nManana was the only one capable of that.
6	tV	Height of rudeness!
7	4	All right, enough prattling, all of you.\nShall we look into it, then?
8	1	Good idea. Let's talk to\nthe Nopon as well.

4	hd1	Would like to eat meat please.
5	Yn1	Would like to eat sweets please.
6	Zn1	Forest is too scary and\nfull of bugs, please fix...
7	3	What the-?! Who or what am I\neven looking at here?
8	9	They ultimate Nopon fusion!\nIs rare to meet.
9	Zd1	Juniper! I'm begging you, please do\nsomething about these fuzzballs!
10	L	L-like what...?
11	hd1	How you say such thing when\nwe come all this way for you!
12	Zd1	You didn't come for me!\nYou came for yourselves!
13	Zd1	I went to Colony 30 to\nlearn a bit about machines...
14	Zd1	And all I got was these lousy Nopon!
15	5	Whoa, just chill for a second. Getting\nall het up ain't gonna solve anything.
16	hd1	Eating sweets is good for help\nissue of anger management.
17	Zd1	I'm done. I'm just...so done.\nGive me a minute and I'll boot them out.
18	L	Or...we could resolve it\nwith no booting necessary?
19	Zd1	Aw, come on, Juniper! I can't believe\nyou're siding with them over me!
20	1	Well, while we're here, why not\nlisten to what they have to say?
21	Yn1	You good and understanding person.\nAll we want do really is help.
22	L	Oh? What are you going to help with?
23	hd1	We very whiz with machine, and we\nmake very interesting thing for you.
24	Zd1	The only thing you've made for us\nis a giant dent in our food supplies,\nyou walking stomachs!
25	hd1	Meh! What stain on honor!
26	Zd1	OK, I am officially all Nopon-ed out.\nGot to check on the meat I'm drying.
27	3	You preserve food?
28	Zd1	Yeah. I have to do it in a hut, which is\nenough of a chore already.
29	Zd1	So I really do not have time\nfor these jokers today.
30	hd1	Oh!
31	Yn1	Is that...
32	Zn1	Inconvenience?
33	Zd1	Oh, it finally clicked, did it?\nYes, you are an inconvenience\nto me, you fuzzy nuisances!
34	L	Honorine, please calm down.\nI've never seen you like this...
35	L	Look, drying and smoking meat\ntakes a lot of work.
36	L	Colony Tau is a special place.\nI know that to you, it may seem\nthat our ways are inefficient, but...
37	hd1	Yes! That exactly why we here!\nCan help with build meat smoker!
38	Zd1	What?!
39	hd1	But currently parts of smoker is missing.\nCure for this is procure for us.
40	Zd1	If you could do something like that,\nwhy didn't you just say so...?
41	hd1	We going to want to eat meats soon,\nso smoker should be built, snip-snap.
42	Zd1	...Nope, can't talk to 'em.
43	8	Nopon always very devoted\nto fulfilling of own wishes.
44	1	OK, so if, say, we were to get you\nthe parts you need for the smoker,\nyou'd be able to build it?
45	hd1	Nopon always keep word.\nCan rely on us!
46	L	OK, good. Honorine,\nwe'll need your help too.
47	Zd1	...Fine. Just for you, Juniper...
48	L	You know they aren't being\nmalicious. Let's see if we can\nget these parts for them.
49	hd1	Good lucks!
evt/nq/msg_nq220602t.json
0	hd1	Do you bring parts of smoker for us?
1	hd1	This plenty enough!\nWe start work straight away!
2	hd1	Hmm, not enough yet. Much\nmore is needed for building.
evt/nq/msg_nq220603f.json
0	Zd1	That should be it, right?
1	hd1	It enough! Now construction\nof smoker is possible!
2	Zd1	...After the runaround you sent us on,\nif you'd said it wasn't possible I'd have\nbooted you out of here myself.
3	hd1	Behold, Sadadan Bros. amaze\nwith power of skill of Nopon!
4	hd1	Let construction begin!
5	3	How long is this gonna take?
6	Zd1	I bet you anything this was\na scam from the start.
7	hd1	Nopon not capable of scam!
8	hd1	Is true. It harder to build than project\nestimate say, and schedule look dicey,\nbut we finish work!
9	hd1	There not quite enough screw,\nbut it still very movable!
10	L	Wow, finished already?\nSo, how does it-?
11	3	No, no, hang on. They straight up\njust brushed a whole bunch of major\nissues under the carpet!
12	hd1	Detail can wait for later!\nIt time to see this baby in action!
13	2	So this is a smoker... Impressive.
14	hd1	Meat go in here, then press button...
15	hd1	And smoking of meat is complete!
16	9	That amazing! Manana want to test!
17	hd1	We know you going to say that!
18	Zd1	Do you have some meat ready\nfor the inaugural smoking, then?
19	hd1	We already tinker machine to smoke-ready.\nPreparation of meat is job of friends!
20	Zd1	...Why am I not surprised?
21	1	What kind of meat do you\nthink would be best?
22	hd1	Any meat fine. Fling it in and\nBob is unclepon of you!
23	L	Sounds like it's time for a hunting trip.\nHonorine, you wait here. We'll be back\nin a flash.

1	1	And we're done!
2	2	So the meat goes in here...

4	5	This looks like where the meat goes.
5	5	Oh, that looks gorgeous.
6	6	I just pop the meat in here, then...?
7	6	Oh yeah, that's the stuff!
8	3	Meat goes in...
9	3	I'd say that went pretty well, eh?
10	4	The ingredients go in here, do they?
11	4	Ah, so that's how it works.

0	hd1	Was guaranteed satisfaction had?
1	L	It's a stunning piece of work.\nAnd it smokes beautifully.
2	Zd1	...And it tastes good too.
3	hd1	Now you admit power of skill of Nopon?
4	Zd1	...Yeah. It's slightly mortifying to\nadmit it, but you did a good job.
5	Zd1	I know I'd never have been able\nto make something like this.
6	hd1	No need for stop! Please to\nkeep showering with praise!
7	Yn1	Praise make Nopon grow!
8	Zn1	Sadadan Bros. available for\nall smoking needs!
9	L	I'm really glad you came to us.
10	hd1	We can make as many\nsmoker as needed!
11	Zd1	Can you, now? That'll certainly\nbe good for colony development...
12	hd1	Now you respect Nopon, yes?\nThen it time for you to provide\nthree snack for three hard worker!
13	Zd1	Yeah, yeah. I'll do that much\nfor you, at least.
14	Zd1	In return, you can teach me the\nins and outs of this thing. I can\nlearn a lot from it.
15	hd1	Is deal!
16	L	Looks like everything\nturned out OK in the end.
17	3	Yeah, all wrapped up neatly.\nExcept for one thing...
18	L	Which is?
19	3	How the spark do they not fall over?
evt/nq/msg_nq220606t.json

1	L	Right. Even before the Flame Clock was\nbroken, she'd always been interested in\nlife outside the colony.
2	L	As soon as she got the chance, she\npicked up and set off for Gamma.
3	6	It must be so cool to be\nable to make accessories.
4	L	Yeah, she's always been quite dexterous.\nAlways big into playing to her advantages.
5	3	All right, you got me interested.\nWhat sort of stuff does she make?
6	6	Oh, let's go visit her and\nyou can see for yourself!
7	L	That's a nice idea. OK, let's\nsee how Korresia's doing.
evt/nq/msg_nq220701f.json
0	L	Hey, Korresia. Do you\nhave a moment to talk?
1	fd1	Sure, what's up?
2	3	We hear you're quite the\naccessory-maker. I was hoping we\ncould take a gander at your work.
3	fd1	Oh! I see... I do enjoy making\nthings. Not sure I'd say any of\nit was good, though.
4	Xd1	Don't be modest. Everyone in Gamma\nadores your work, don't they?
5	fd1	W-well, um, I guess... But I can't just\ncome out and say that myself!
6	2	If your work is as lovely as it sounds,\nI think you're allowed to be proud of it!
7	fd1	Yeah, I suppose...
8	Xd1	You know, you've actually come at\nthe perfect time. We were just talking\nabout something.
9	5	Oh yeah?
10	Xd1	Korresia here's been telling me she\nwants to study more accessories.
11	fd1	Hey!
12	Xd1	She's just too shy to say it.
13	Xd1	So what do you say? Would you be\nable to bring some accessories here\nfor her to study?
14	L	Hmm, I see.
15	fd1	I mean...just...there's a lot of styles\nand things I've never seen before...
16	fd1	It's just a little hobby of mine,\nthough. I wouldn't want to annoy\nthe colony with it...
17	4	On the contrary, the application of such\na skill might actually contribute a positive\neffect on colony development.
18	L	What did you have in mind?
19	4	If you can make accessories, you\ncan sell them to other colonies.
20	4	I think there'd be a decent market for it.
21	L	Hmm, you're right. That sounds\nlike a really good idea.
22	L	How does that sound, Korresia?\nYou can use your hobby to help\nthe colony out.
23	fd1	I'll do my best...
24	fd1	In that case, I think I really need to\nsee other styles of accessories...
25	fd1	It'll help me improve my craft.
26	1	We can certainly help you out with that.
27	fd1	Thank you! Then, bring me as many\ndifferent things as you can, please!

10	Wg1	Me too!
11	fd1	This one, yes? And this one...\nOh, who wanted what? Gah,\nI've lost track!
12	L	I couldn't have asked for\na better outcome.

14	fd1	I didn't know it would be so hard...

16	bg1	I'm so sorry, I could only get\nhold of everyone for today...
17	fd1	Oh, no, it's fine! I'm just grateful people\ncame to look at my work at all...

26	fd1	And I'll perfect my art for Colony Tau!
27	L	If anyone can make this work,\nit's you, Korresia.
28	@f1	Nico's really sorry to butt in, but Nico -\nthat's me - needs your expert opinion on\nwhich of these suits Nico better!
29	fd1	Hmm, let me see, which one...?
30	L	I'm glad she found her niche.
31	1	Yeah, she's going places all right.
32	L	It's a wonderful feeling, seeing your\nfriends go out and find their place in the\nworld. A place they can truly blossom...
evt/nq/msg_nq220705t.json
0	dd1	Korresia makes absolutely\ndreamy accessories, you know.
1	dd1	She's so good with her hands.\nIt's enough to make you jealous.
evt/nq/msg_nq220706t.json
0	ed1	Korresia came back to us recently.
1	ed1	She was in Colony Gamma,\ngetting inspired, but it looks like\nthere's something on her mind...
evt/nq/msg_nq220800f.json
0	Wd1	Oh, brilliant, I was just\nlooking for you guys.
1	1	Really?
2	Wd1	Really. You're just in time\nto give me a hand.
3	5	Oh, uh... Great?
4	L	Why were you looking for\nthem in particular?
5	Wd1	Ah, sorry, just got a bit\noverexcited there.
6	Wd1	You know that you can find ether in\nthe Colony Lambda tunnels, right?
7	3	Not really, no.
8	Wd1	Huh. Well, anyway.
9	Wd1	Lambda's absolutely riddled with ether.\nThey've got this probe they use to find it.
10	4	Yes, I was aware. It's very\nrich in resources as a colony.
11	Wd1	Uh-huh. And when I saw the probe\nin action, it just dawned on me.
12	Wd1	What if Colony Tau has some natural\nresources we could tap into too?
13	Wd1	So I thought I'd just borrow\nthe probe and have a look-see!
14	2	You're really raring to go, huh...
15	gd1	I'm not sure just charging around aimlessly\nis going to get you the results you want.
16	L	I wouldn't go that far, Nootka...
17	Wd1	We've at least got to look.\nAnd that's where you come in.
18	6	I don't think there's any harm in trying.
19	Wd1	Exactly my thoughts. Don't listen\nto Nootka being all pessimistic.\nIt's a good thing you came.
20	gd1	Your problem is you haven't got\ntwo thoughts in your head.
21	L	Sorry... It's not that Selin and\nNootka don't get along...
22	4	As long as we can definitively verify\nthe presence of resources, that should\nbe the end of the argument.
23	3	Something like that.
24	Wd1	Just think - if we do find something, we\ncould be raking it in just like Lambda!
25	Wd1	Let's get this ball rolling, then. Come with\nme to the Tree Hollow Opening!
26	1	All right...
evt/nq/msg_nq220801t.json
0	L	Are there resources here?
1	Wd1	Ah, there you are. I don't know,\ncan't really say just yet.
2	Wd1	But I reckon we'll have a good idea\nonce we use this device to look around.
3	L	Right.
4	Wd1	Here, take it.
5	1	OK...
6	Wd1	Give it a quick test. Just stick it\nsomewhere around here.
7	2	Let's give it a try.
evt/nq/msg_nq220802f.json
0	6	OK, let's do this!
1	5	Oof, that's loud.
2	4	I could do without the noise.
3	1	Is it reacting?
4	6	Looks like it's...kinda...
5	2	Hold on. We've got visitors!
6	5	Eh? Who'd visit us out\nin the middle of...?! Gah!
7	L	They must have been\nattracted by the sound!
8	4	Hmm, looks like there's\nstill room for improvement.
9	2	Well don't just stare at them,\ndo something!
evt/nq/msg_nq220803f.json
0	L	That should be enough searching.\nDo we have any results?
1	Wd1	Yeah, but there's nothing here.\nThe reaction was pretty faint.
2	Wd1	I'd say we'll have better\nluck in the lower levels.
3	5	Least you got a reaction!\nBetter than nothing, right?
4	Wd1	Right you are.\nI'll head on down and-
5	L	No, Selin, you're on standby.\nWait for us at the colony.
6	Wd1	Aw what? I didn't come all this way to\nstand around twiddling my thumbs!
7	L	The lower levels are dangerous, and until\nwe know whether there are resources, I'm\nnot going to put you at risk.
8	1	They're probably crawling with strong\nmonsters, too. We'll handle it better alone.
9	Wd1	...OK, fine. I don't want\nto weigh you all down.
10	Wd1	Sorry guys, but it looks like I'll be\nlivin' it up here on my ownsome.
11	3	We'll come and get you soon as\nsomething turns up.
12	Wd1	I owe you!
evt/nq/msg_nq220804f.json
0	2	This seems like a good place.
1	1	Yeah, let's stick that probe in.
2	6	Whoa, this is, like, off the charts!
3	4	I suppose there really are resources\nto be had around here...
4	5	You bein' a naysayer again?
5	4	I am. I didn't think it would be\nso easy to find anything.
6	3	Bully for us, but if that sparking sound\nattracts more monsters, then-
7	3	...What did I tell you?
8	6	Better get 'em outta here if we\nwant to check our findings, huh!
9	1	Let's do it!
evt/nq/msg_nq220805f.json
0	L	This is exactly why I didn't bring Selin\nwith us. The lower levels are no joke.
1	1	Yeah. Good thing we managed to\nwhack those monsters as well.
2	6	Oh, hey! Now it's reacting differently!
3	4	I think that means this is the place.
4	L	So Colony Tau has its own\nresources too... Wow.
5	2	That's right. And Selin was right about\nit probably benefiting the colony.
6	5	Then let's not keep him\nwaiting for the report!
7	3	Heh, think he'll faint with shock?
8	L	Haha, he might! Let's give him the good\nnews and put him out of his misery.
evt/nq/msg_nq220806t.json
0	Wd1	You're back! So, did you find anything?
1	L	We did. According to your device,\nthere are resources in the lower levels.
2	Wd1	There are?!
3	3	Yeah, but the monsters are\nrock hard down in there.
4	Wd1	Eh, not a problem. As long as there\nare resources to find, we can work\ntogether with Lambda.
5	L	You've already hammered out\na deal with them?
6	Wd1	They said they'd lend us Levnises\nto help with the excavation.
7	4	That would certainly preclude the lower\nlevel monsters from posing a problem.
8	4	Lambda's troops are highly trained\nprofessionals. I can't see any problems\narising as long as they're on the case.
9	L	That's great if they're going\nto help. Really nice work.
10	Wd1	I'll get myself off to Lambda then and\ntell them the good news. Oh, but first...
11	Wd1	I need to rub it in Nootka's face\nthat I was right. Thanks, all!
12	3	Yeah, not foreseeing a lot\nof harmony in their future.
13	L	Oh, they'll be fine. They're really close\nfriends underneath all the antagonism.
14	L	They respect each other a lot.
15	3	Well, you know them better than me.
16	L	They both care a lot about Colony Tau,\nand I don't doubt they'll work to better it.
evt/nq/msg_nq220900s.json
0	1	So there's supposed to be this spring,\nwhose water makes you stronger...
1	2	Yeah, I heard about that too.
2	6	Just from drinking it?\nWow, that's the dream!
3	5	Man, yeah, I'd love a bit of that.
4	tV	Nopon have story that eating\nred pollen orb make you strong.\nProbably same kind of story.
5	6	I'd love to find that spring...
6	3	It's a load of bollocks. If something\nlike that really exists, why haven't\nother colonies heard of it?
7	4	I've got to say, I have no\nknowledge of this either.
8	1	Then why don't we investigate it?
9	1	I mean, if we look into it and find that\nthere really is water that makes you\nstronger, that's win-win, right?
10	4	True. But this wouldn't be the first\nspurious legend to grace this colony.
11	4	If this is a malicious custom that\nstarted in Colony Tau, we should\ndebunk it now.
12	L	As you wish. The Spring\nof Rhonnar is the place.
evt/nq/msg_nq220901f.json
0	gd1	What are you doing here?
1	L	They're looking for the spring.\nWhat about you, Nootka?
2	gd1	I was thinking of putting all that\nknowledge I got from Colony Iota\nabout water and rocks to use.
3	gd1	I think perhaps that drinking this\nwater isn't suddenly going to turn\nyou into a better soldier.
4	5	Mate! This stuff is so good!
5	6	So good!
6	4	It's just water, how can it be-\n...Oh, it does taste nice.
7	4	You could make a sublime\ncup of tea with this.
8	gd1	It is really top-quality water,\nbut I don't think there's anything\nparticularly special in it.
9	1	So it's just a normal spring?
10	gd1	Seems that way. I don't think\nit'll give you any powers.
11	6	Whaaat?!
12	5	Tell that to these bulging biceps!
13	4	Both of you are already plenty\nstrong enough. It's all in your head.
14	L	...Should we try one more spring?\nIf other fountains are as good as this,\nthen it would spare us the trek.
15	2	Is there a spring closer to Tau?
16	L	There is. This area's a bit too monster-\ninfested for comfort. At worst, we might\nbe surrounded.
17	L	The other spring is a lot more\npeaceful. It would be far preferable\nfor us as a water source.
18	gd1	I see your point. OK, let's\ntake a look. Follow me.
19	1	Thanks.
evt/nq/msg_nq220902t.json
0	gd1	Wait here while I look around.
1	gd1	Hmm. Well, its composition is practically\nidentical to the other spring...
2	L	Interesting.
3	gd1	It's definitely better to\ndraw our water from here.
4	L	We've had a lot of casualties,\ngetting our water from that spring.
5	L	This is far and away the better choice.
6	6	They're both pretty much the same.
7	5	Then how come that other one's\ngot a legend about beefing you up\nand this doesn't?
8	L	No idea. It's just something\nthat people have said.
9	4	That's how customs work. It doesn't\nmatter how ludicrous they are, people\nrefuse to let go of them.
10	gd1	Glory always had an awful time trekking\nup there to fetch water. If we can lighten\nher load, I count that a win.
11	gd1	She's already working hard enough\ntrying to treat all our injured.
12	L	Graziana, too. She and Glory are\nresponsible for the water supplies.
13	gd1	Graziana's very careful. Thankfully,\nshe hasn't had any unpleasant monster\nencounters yet.
14	gd1	The water's so good from this spring, too.\nShe should be pleased.
15	L	Do you mind if we leave you\nto spread the good news?
16	gd1	No problem! Let me just fill 'er up\nfirst. Thanks for coming out here!
17	1	No bother at all. We're just happy if we\ncan stop more people from getting hurt.
18	2	Right. It's little things like these that make\nlife easier for everyone. Hang in there!
evt/nq/msg_nq220903t.json

0	2	Does Tau have any special traditions\nfor reaching a new term?
1	L	We do. In our ninth term\nspecifically, we have to set out\nalone for the lower levels.
2	6	But that's so dangerous! Why there?
3	L	Once you get there, a multitude of\nsupplies are airdropped to you.
4	L	You pick them up, bring them home,\nand everyone recognizes your skills\nas a soldier.
5	5	Another custom, huh.
6	L	I don't think many people have\nactually managed to do it, though.
7	L	In fact, in all the time I've been here,\nI don't think a single person came back...
8	4	Probably the Consul's way of\nthinning Tau's numbers.
9	4	A very convenient set-up to have\npeople wander off on their own and\nget themselves killed by monsters.
10	3	Hang on. Wasn't Raine shooting\nhis mouth off about doing this?
11	L	...He was indeed.
12	L	He takes Colony Tau's\ntraditions very seriously.
13	L	He can't just abandon the legacy\nof our predecessors, and their\npredecessors before them.
14	1	We have to stop him.
15	L	If he'd even listen to us...
16	1	We have to try anyway. We\ncan't let him do anything stupid.
17	L	You're right. Let's find Raine.

1	5	Are you going on this\nHunt of Plenty thing?
2	_c1	Oh, did someone spill the beans?\nAha, you were with Juniper.
3	_c1	But yeah, I am.\nIt's a rite of passage.
4	3	You know how snuffin' dangerous\nthe lower levels are. And yet you're\nstill going down there?
5	_c1	Oh, come on, now you're\ngiving me an earful too?
6	_c1	Glory was up here yapping on about\nthe same thing. Thing is, it's a ritual.\nWe don't get to pick and choose.
7	_c1	This tradition was passed down\nto us. And I'm going to carry it out,\nfor all our dead friends.
8	L	But Raine...
9	_c1	I know the Consul's out of the picture,\nbut we're not exactly in the lap of luxury\nhere. We could do with the supplies.
10	1	Then just let us-
11	_c1	Sorry, no can do.\nBesides, I'll be fine.
12	_c1	Right, I'm off hunting.\nGot to do a favor for Nootka.
13	_c1	She'll give me a real dressing-down\nif I don't, and I don't know about you,\nbut she scares me when she's angry.
14	6	So...we're just gonna let him\ndo this thing?
15	L	...I don't think so. We have to\npersuade him to drop the ritual.
16	2	Firstly, where did he go?\nHe didn't say.
17	1	Let's ask Nootka. We have to stop\nhim from doing anything dangerous.
evt/nq/msg_nq221002t.json
0	L	Nootka, do you know where\nRaine's gone off to?
1	gd1	Um... He'll be out hunting for the\nAgeshu meat I asked for, presumably.
2	2	Where are Ageshus found?
3	L	...That's pretty close to the lower levels.
4	6	That's not good!
5	gd1	He went with a group, though, right?\nHe's the one who's always banging on\nabout how no one should go there alone.
6	L	I'm afraid he went on his own...
7	gd1	Oh, Raine...!
8	1	We'd better find him, quick!
evt/nq/msg_nq221003f.json

1	rm1	Friend? You look for flockmate, kraa?
2	5	Well, do you know where he is?
3	ud1	I hear you looking for friend, yes!
4	3	Right, yeah.\nSo can you tell us?
5	ud1	Kan tell, yes! He on last legs so\nI thought maybe good to eat him.
6	L	No...! He's very dear to us!
7	ud1	You too kwik to assume! Tirking\nhighness arrange to treat flockmate's\nwounds. He kurrently resting.
8	ud1	He very lucky. We almost forget\nyou our kontrakt partners. Even\nhad marinade ready to go!

3	sd1	Is not need.\nSit down, have rest, kraa!
4	_c1	Juniper... I've embarrassed\nmyself a bit here, haven't I...
5	L	...Yes, you have, a bit. I wish\nyou wouldn't be so reckless.
6	_c1	I was never like this in the past.
7	_c1	I'm losing my edge. I'm weak...
8	L	That makes two of us, then.
9	L	All these old traditions and customs...\nHonestly, we need to let them go.
10	_c1	Now, Juniper, you-
11	L	Of course there are still precious\nthings. The memories of those\nwe've lost, our culture...
12	L	But we have to stop placing our\nideals so high above us that we'll\nwaste our lives for them.
13	L	The colony's changing. We have\nresources, water, food, new allies.
14	1	Exactly. And we - other colonies -\ncan help you out too.
15	L	Progress doesn't mean\nforgetting our history.

19	L	Is that such a bad thing?
20	_c1	Not at all. Your predecessor\ntalked about that kind of stuff\na lot. Strength and kindness.

0	1	Ashera, what will Colony 11 do now?
1	M	Hm? Why ask me?
2	3	Try not to play dumb...\nMaybe he's asking because it's\nyour colony?
3	M	Erm, no? Surely it's your colony now,\nif anything.
4	3	Wha... Just how do you figure that?
5	M	I figure it by how soundly Colony 11\nwas thrashed into submission by the\ntraitorous Ouroboros.
6	M	They say to the victor go the spoils.\nTherefore, Colony 11 now belongs\nto you lot.
7	2	You were also on the winning side,\nif memory serves.
8	5	Ahh, if the commander herself says\nit's fine, who are we to argue?
9	4	Our list of allies is limited. We're grateful\nfor any cooperation.
10	M	Oh, I forgot to tell you something...
11	M	We're a fickle lot in Colony 11. Most of us\ndo as we please. So you should be\ncareful how you handle us.
12	M	Just because I've taken a liking to\nyou doesn't mean the others will.
13	3	Why can't you just explain our good\nqualities to them, get them to help us?
14	M	What, I should just tell them directly?\nA bunch of people who'll cut me down\nif I show any weakness?
15	3	I guess that won't work...\nBut then what the spark are we\nsupposed to do?
16	M	Hmm. Let me give you a piece\nof advice, as former commander.
17	M	In Colony 11 there's a group\nof elite soldiers called the Three Ravens.
18	6	Three...?
19	M	You don't remember?\nThey fought us on Ixia Bridge.
20	5	Oh, those guys!\nTheir names were...lemme think...
21	M	"Spearhead Zoren",\n"Fellplume Easel", and\n"Tenacious Clad".
22	M	They lead the three units that make\nup Colony 11. You could call them\nthe pillars of the colony.
23	M	Win those three over, and you've\nbasically got the whole colony.
24	5	You make it sound simple. How are\nwe meant to "win them over", exactly?
25	M	Good question. I simply crushed\nthem until they did my bidding.
26	3	Queen's teeth, no wonder they\nwanna kill you!
27	M	But I know that you lot can play it\na bit smarter than that.
28	M	For example, you could glean some\nintel about them. The best way to know\nan enemy is to become their friend.
29	6	Whoa...
30	M	They may be a group of thugs, but as\nsoldiers go they're the best of the best.\nNot as good as me, obviously.
31	M	I can't see any downside to winning them\nover. It'd do wonders for your ally base.\nHow about it?
32	1	You're not wrong there.\nWe'll think it over.
33	M	Thinking, is it?\nDon't deliberate over it for too long.
34	3	What's that supposed to mean?
35	M	Leave that lot alone for too long and\nthey'll end up in some battle or other.
36	M	You'd better do something about them\nbefore they end up being a nuisance for\nsomeone else.
37	3	Is trouble seriously all your\ncolony is good for...?
38	M	Hahaha, might be!\nWell, I wish you luck!
evt/nq/msg_nq230101f.json
0	fe1	Well, if it isn't Ashera and\nthe Ouroboros rebels.
1	M	Oho, the Three Ravens have alighted.\nWhat can we do for you?
2	ge1	Let's get straight to the point.\nWe'll be waiting at the First Ixia Bridge.
3	3	Uh, and...?\nMaybe try telling us what you want?
4	he1	...
5	M	Hmm, something tells me you're\nbeing serious this time.
6	fe1	We've told you what you need to know.\nDon't keep us waiting.
7	3	Self-centered as ever... They come here,\nbarely say anything and have the gall to\ntell us not to keep them waiting...
8	M	Hmm...
evt/nq/msg_nq230102f.json
0	3	Here we are, as requested!\nNow tell us what you want.
1	fe1	What else? But before we get to that...\nAshera. I want to ask you something.
2	M	Let's not stand on ceremony. Shoot.
3	fe1	The way I hear it, these rebels are looking\nto take control of Colony 11.
4	fe1	But you must be the one who\nsicced them on us.
5	M	Now, I wonder, where you could have\nheard that from? Not that you're wrong...
6	fe1	Hmph, I see.\nYou must have really taken\na shine to them.
7	M	Again, I wouldn't say you were wrong.\nSo...? What are you trying to say?
8	fe1	If you're wanting to give up control\nof the colony to this lot, then I say\nhave at it.
9	fe1	But if you think we'll just let\nyou go with a little parade after\nall the beatings you've given us...
10	M	Ah, and here it comes.
11	ge1	I've always dreamed of hunting the\nbeast that dwells within you.
12	ge1	Make my dream come true, Ashera.\nWe'll make this the best hunt of our lives!
13	M	Well now. You're finally going\nto settle things with me.
14	M	But if that's what you want, why\ncall these people out? I thought\nI was the one you want.
15	he1	Because they've earned your\nrecognition, Ashera.
16	he1	And I wish to fight not just you,\nbut Ouroboros one more time.
17	he1	Only you people can give me the pain...\nthe satisfaction I've been looking for!
18	3	I honestly didn't know\nthis guy could speak.
19	6	It doesn't really fit his image...
20	M	Well I never! I didn't think I'd ever\nhear your voice again in this life, Clad.
21	M	So the three of you are really\nserious about this...
22	M	I'm sorry, friends, but I need\nto ask you a favor.
23	3	How'd I know it'd come to this...?
24	M	Hahaha, I praise your powers\nof foresight! Will you refuse?
25	3	...Let's just say you'll owe me one.\nBe ready to pay up later.
26	M	Zoren, Easel, Clad.\nThere's no more need for words.
27	M	You wanted this, and now you'll get it...\nA fight to the death!
evt/nq/msg_nq230103f.json
0	fe1	Ugh! You truly are powerful...\nEven now, we're no match for you.
1	he1	...
2	M	I could say the same for you.\nYou're much more capable than\nwhen I first met you!
3	M	I've really had to bring my\nA-game for this.
4	ge1	Hmph, is that so...?\nYour A-game... Hahaha...
5	M	Huh? Did I say something funny?
6	fe1	You might not understand, existing so\nfar beyond what we call "strength"...
7	fe1	We might call ourselves the Three Ravens,\nbut compared to you we're grunts. Worms\ncrawling in the dirt.
8	fe1	I don't want to admit this...but I can\nsee why you've taken a liking to\nthese people.
9	3	I'll be snuffed...
10	fe1	But! Though that may be so,\nwe are soldiers! We desire to be strong.
11	fe1	Even in the face of overwhelming odds\nit's only right to wish to strike back!
12	M	...
13	3	So you won't have any regrets.\nEven if you bite the dust?
14	ge1	I would accept my death easier, knowing\nI faced its jaws, rather than wait to fade\ninto a husk like a weakling.
15	M	An acceptable death, eh?
16	M	I never thought I'd hear such\nwords from you three.
17	M	By the way, friends. You just burned\neverything you have for a full-on battle\nto the death.
18	M	You must really be at your limit.\nDo you really have the strength to\nkeep standing there?
19	fe1	Enough! We aren't so weak as\nto stand here listening to your prattle!
20	ge1	We have no more need of you.\nBe somewhere else.
21	3	No need to act tough...
22	fe1	Just get the spark out of here!
23	3	Yeah, yeah, easy, chief.
24	M	I've never thought of you as grunts.\nNot once.
25	M	You're true soldiers.\n...Let's have another fight to\nthe death some time.
evt/nq/msg_nq230200s.json
0	5	That Zoren guy? Pretty sure he was\nfirst on the scene when we tangled\nwith Colony 11.
1	4	Zoren's unit makes up the main force\nof Colony 11. They're a vanguard\ncomprised of shock troopers.
2	4	In battle they specialize in breaking\nthrough the enemy vanguard and wreaking\nhavoc among the enemy forces.
3	5	Yeesh. That sounds about right.
4	6	Sounds like a bunch of people\njust like Ashera...
5	3	Leaving them alone is pretty\nmuch the worst thing we could do.
6	2	We should probably talk to\nthem as soon as we can...
7	3	They said they'd gather at the\nwest gate, right?
8	1	That sounds right. We'd better head out.
evt/nq/msg_nq230201f.json
0	6	Nobody here.
1	1	This is the west gate, right?\nDid we hear them wrong?
2	oe1	Oh. You guys.\nZoren's unit headed out long ago.
3	3	Headed out? Where to?
4	oe1	Where do you think? Colony Lambda!\nFinally taking the fight to them... Wait.\nYou didn't know?
5	3	Mate, what?
6	4	Wait, did you say they're\nhitting Colony Lambda?
7	oe1	I believe I did, yeah.
8	5	You what?! What the spark for?!
9	oe1	What, suddenly we need a reason?\nWe're soldiers, so we fight.
10	3	That's not what he means!
11	3	Ugh, is there anybody in this place\nwho doesn't think violence is the\nanswer to everything, including boredom?!
12	4	Complain later. We're heading\nto Lambda!
13	2	Right! We've got to stop this\nfight however we can!
14	3	Ugh, we're only at the start and\nI'm already worried about the future...
evt/nq/msg_nq230202f.json
0	4	No sign of Zoren yet.\nLooks like we beat them here.
1	1	Yeah, but I'm sure they'll\nturn up any minute.
2	1	...Someone's calling?
3	106je10	Hehehe, correct.\nWe are right in front of you.
4	10310	Huh? Zoren's forces?
5	104je10	Mmm, the smell of it...
6	10310	Uh, what?
7	104je10	Anger...or is it righteous indignation?\nI'm also catching the scent of unease,\nand a sense of obligation...
8	10310	What are you even talking about?
9	104je10	So, you've come to\nstop the fighting, yes?
10	10310	(gasp) How did you...\nBut if you know that, then...
11	104je10	What you ask is impossible.\nThe captain has already given\nthe order for the operation.
12	10310	Then take us to Zoren!\nWe'll talk to him ourselves.
13	104je10	If you're so worked up about it,\nwhy don't you come talk to me\nface-to-face?
14	104je10	Right now I'm scouting out Lambda,\nbut I've got a fix on your position, too.
15	108je10	I'm watching you even now... Hehehe.
16	1	...
17	3	Noah, what did she want?
18	1	If we want to talk to Zoren\nwe'll have to find her first.
19	2	No location?
20	1	Nope. But she said she's watching\nus right now.
21	4	So she's holed up somewhere\nscanning the area.
22	5	You're joking, an area this open?
23	3	Ugh, what a...\nI'll find her, if I have to rip up\nevery blade of grass I see!

1	je1	Oh dear... You're here sooner\nthan I expected. I suppose I should\nhave known better...
2	3	Yeah, skip the flattery.\nTake us to Zoren. Like, now.
3	je1	Hehe... Right, that's\nwhat you were after.
4	je1	Just wait. I'll contact the\ncaptain now.
5	fe1	What in the world do you want,\nOuroboros? You'd better have a very\ngood reason to interrupt an operation.
6	1	Just listen. There's no point in you\nattacking Colony Lambda any more!
7	fe1	Is that so?
8	4	Their Flame Clock is already destroyed!\nThey're the same as Colony 11 now.\nYou know what that means?
9	fe1	Indeed?\n...So what?
10	2	What do you mean, so what?
11	fe1	My unit has been steadily preparing\nfor the day we attack Lambda.
12	fe1	Nothing will change our plan, however\nmuch you whine. ...And that includes\nwhat's about to happen.
13	3	Does it look like I give a snuff?\nCall your men back right now!
14	ie1	Um, Zor...\nSorry to bother you while you're busy...
15	fe1	Strider? I thought you were\non reconnaissance.
16	ie1	Yeah, sorry 'bout that.\nI've got an urgent report for you.
17	fe1	Continue.
18	ie1	Well, I'll cut to the chase.\nA Kevesi force is invading\nLambda.
19	4	Did you say Kevesi?\nThey don't belong to you?
20	ie1	I suppose I did say that. They\nmust have come to take advantage of\nthe confusion after the Flame Clock went.
21	ie1	Lambda's hardly at their best,\nbut...this could be pretty dicey.
22	fe1	Spark it... Do those uncultured boors\nwant to snatch our prize away from us?
23	ie1	We'll encounter them soon.\nWhat do we do, sir?
24	fe1	Need you ask? We hit Lambda first.
25	ie1	Understood. Guess these things happen.

27	fe1	Battle positions!\nZoren Unit, we attack!
28	1	W-wait! We're not done talking-
29	6	What do we do? Lambda's\ngonna be...
30	5	What about that force from Keves?\nWe gotta stop them too or things\nwill get ugly!

1	fe1	You people again. Do you want to stop\nour war so badly?
2	5	Do YOU want to fight it so badly?\nJust tell me why!
3	fe1	Hah! You want a reason from me?\nThen I'll tell you!
4	fe1	The only kind of strength I acknowledge\nis found in blood-soaked adversity!
5	fe1	I hone myself to perfection by pushing\nmyself to the verge of death.
6	fe1	That is the true meaning of\nbattle, and why I fight.
7	2	So you'll keep on fighting, just to\nmake yourself stronger?
8	fe1	Of course. Don't tell me you're\ngoing to ask why I wish to be strong?
9	3	(sigh) I get it. I can kind\nof understand where you're coming from.
10	3	You know that makes you\na great big coward, right?
11	fe1	...Did you just call me a coward?
12	4	Eunie!
13	3	Yep. It's like you and your mate said.
14	3	Lambda's in chaos after losing their\nFlame Clock. They've lost their\nbig boy pants.
15	3	The Kevesi forces are gonna\nexploit that weakness.
16	fe1	So I heard. What of it?
17	3	So, ain't you doing the exact\nsame thing as them?
18	fe1	Wha...!
19	fe1	Don't talk rot! We are not the same!\nAbsolutely not!
20	3	You reckon? What's different?\nJust try and explain, I'm all ears.
21	fe1	...
22	3	...
23	fe1	You have some nerve...!
24	fe105fe10	There's been a change of plans.\nThe new target is the Kevesi force\ninvading Lambda!
25	fe104je10	Huh?
26	fe104ie10	Erm, you're all right with leaving Lambda?
27	fe103fe10	You questioning an order from your\ncommanding officer?
28	fe104ie10	Yikes! All right, understood!
29	fe108je10	Understood...\nMwahaha... This could be fun.
30	fe1	I seem to remember Colony Lambda\nare your allies, correct?
31	3	Yeah, so?
32	fe1	You have had the insolence to\nlabel me a coward.
33	fe1	Yet is it not also the height of cowardice to\nlet your allies face danger alone, while you\nremain fixated on thwarting me and mine?
34	3	Hah, you have to ask?\nWhen it comes down to it, we do\nwhat we have to do.
35	fe1	Hmph.
36	fe1	Zoren Unit! Crush them!\nTrample every enemy you see!
evt/nq/msg_nq230207f.json

1	ie1	Sorry, but that was just the first wave.\nMore will come, so you'd better not\nget cold feet.

1	5	Not that I've been looking forward to\nthis, but if they're coming, they need to\nhurry up so I can wreck 'em!
2	fe1	Hah, very well! Abandon yourself\nto your killer instinct and unleash\neverything you have!
3	je1	It's such a shame it's nearly over...\nI'll fight until I'm totally sated...
evt/nq/msg_nq230209f.json
0	ie1	Phew, that lot put up more of\na fight than I thought they would.
1	ie1	To say nothing of having to defend\nthe force we were supposed to fight,\nwhich I still don't get.
2	je1	Hehe... But it was a most\nenjoyable turn of events.
3	fe1	Hm, indeed.
4	fe1	Well, it seems we fell for your\nlittle scheme rather neatly.
5	3	You what now?
6	fe1	Stopping our fight with Lambda,\nand even convincing us to defend\nthem against the others...
7	fe1	It is most galling to have\nfallen for your strategy so\ncompletely!
8	3	I, er, well...
9	3	I-I mean of course you did!\nCan't believe you only just noticed!
10	1	...
11	4	(sigh)
12	fe1	Hah, what nerve!\nBut now I finally see.
13	fe1	I could never understand\nwhy Ashera was so fixated on\nyou all.
14	fe1	But it seems there was some\nbenefit to her scheming.
15	6	Um, I wouldn't go that far...
16	fe1	But do not think that the great Zoren\nwill continue to dance to your tune!
17	fe1	Someday there will be a reckoning\nbetween us, with none of your\ncheap tricks!
18	fe1	The operation is over!\nZoren Unit, return to base!
19	ie1	Oops, sorry about that. The captain has\na bit of a short fuse. Sometimes he\nsays things without thinking them through.
20	je1	In other words...he's an idiot.
21	4	You said it, not us. And he's\nsupposed to be your superior.
22	je1	Hehe... But he seems to like you.
23	5	Uh, didn't he just say there'd\nbe a "reckoning between us"?
24	ie1	That's exactly it, though!\nIf he didn't like you, he'd\njust kill you outright.
25	je1	He's the type who likes to\nplay with his food before he eats it.
26	3	Like he's some starving beast\nor something?
27	ie1	If you want to quiet this beast,\nthe best way is to give him\nsomething to fight.
28	ie1	Telling him not to fight would be\nlike telling you to stop breathing.
29	je1	Personally these spur-of-the-moment\nbattles are what I live for... Hehe...
30	fe1	Strider, Widow! What's the delay?\nCease your dawdling!
31	ie1	He's getting scary again!\nTime for me to take my leave.
32	je1	Hehe... I hope we meet\nagain, Ouroboros.

0	1	What sort of group is Easel's unit?
1	2	They're more of a rearguard unit - they\nfire from a distance and support the\nfront line.
2	2	Seems that Colony 11's canteen\nis also under their control.
3	3	The canteen? How come?
4	2	Who knows? I just hear that\nEasel's unit is usually there.
5	5	So if we win 'em over, we get\nour pick of all the best food!

4	1	Wh-when did that all start?
5	ke1	So how about it? Are you going to\ntorture us until we do what you want?
6	3	That's a big fat nope!\nCome on, just take us to your boss.

9	ke1	That's... Well.
10	ke1	I probably could tell you...but it's\nnot something I'll do for free.
11	3	I've got an awful feeling about this.
12	ke1	The thing is, the captain requested\nprovisions and I need to hurry if I'm\ngonna get them to her.
13	ke1	Our stores are empty at\na very bad time.
14	ke1	I mean, the kind of scum and idiots we\nhave in Colony 11 have pretty greedy\nappetites.
15	2	...Right.
16	ke1	So yeah. Can you pick up ten Obsidian\nBerries and Monstrum Mangoes each?
17	5	Man, that's a lot. And...it's all fruit?
18	ke1	It's Captain Easel's favorite.\nShe's a major stickler for sweet stuff.

6	ke1	Captain Easel, these people here\nwant your unit to belong to them.
7	3	You can shut your trap!\nYou'll just make things complicated.

4	ge1	Sit down. This will be over soon.
5	ke1	Ahaha, you don't think we'll just\nlet you go?
6	6	Uh... So. This meat wouldn't be...?
7	ge1	Consuming your kill is also\npart of the hunt.
8	3	Ugh, I knew it... Queen's wings,\njust let us go!
9	1	Is this even edible?
10	2	I think so? It actually looks kind of good...
11	le1	Hehe, everything we use here is\nbrought to us by the captain, you know!
12	le1	And turning whatever piece of crap\nmeat we find into a masterpiece falls\nto me, Branden!
13	3	I knew you'd give us something dodgy!
14	ge1	Now. You wished to speak with me.
15	3	Ack! With all this going on,\nI completely forgot...
16	ge1	If you're looking to take control of\nColony 11, then do as you please.\nI have no objections.
17	4	I'm surprised to hear you say that.\nIs that really what you want?
18	ge1	I'm not doing this out of goodwill.\nI have my own reason.
19	ge1	To me, all of you are no different\nto those Kapibas... Bait.
20	5	Bait, eh? Not prey?
21	ge1	No, you are bait, and it's Ashera\nwho's sunk her teeth into you.
22	ge1	Your talents are what attract my prize.\nHow could I ignore such a lure?
23	ge1	You'll continue to lure the highest-\nquality prey for me, Ouroboros.\nHehehe...
24	3	This one could give Ashera a\nrun for her money in the crazy stakes.
25	ge1	This conversation is over.\nNow, eat as much as you want.
26	ge1	Give thanks to the creature's blood\nand flesh. Make its life your own.

2	3	Hmm. I'm surprised their roles\nare so evenly divided.
3	4	They're specialists in combat.\nEven if they're a rotten bunch,\nthey're Silver-rank elites.
4	1	But we know almost nothing\nabout the captain, Clad.
5	3	He's always wearing a helmet.\nI'd wonder if anyone's ever seen his face.
6	1	All we do know is that he\nconstantly drills his troops in\n"training pits".
7	6	Training pits?
8	4	Like the plaza where we fought R.\nApparently that's what they call\none of those in Colony 11.
9	5	I get it. Well, why don't we\npay a visit? We might get\nlucky and bump into him.
evt/nq/msg_nq230401f.json
0	3	Hey, who's that?
1	1	Is that Clad down there?!
2	5	What the spark is going on?\nOne soldier against two Levnises?\nThey call that training?
3	4	I think it's safe to say they\nstill enjoy killing each other...
4	3	Ugh!
5	6	What do we do?\nIf we do nothing, then that guy is...
6	3	Arrrgh! You mudders!
7	2	Eunie, what are you doing?!
8	3	What do you think?! I'm gonna\nstop those Levnises!
9	4	I thought something like this\nmight happen...
evt/nq/msg_nq230402f.json
0	ne1	What do you think you're doing?!\nYou reckon we'll just let you waltz\nin and do whatever you want?!
1	me1	Gahahaha, you just jumped into the\nfray! You rebels must be crazy!
2	3	Shut up! You're the ones about\nto let those Levnises turn a guy into paste!
3	ne1	Whaaaat?! Are you disparaging\nour noble training? The pride of\nthe Clad Unit?!
4	me1	Haha, guess there's no denying that\nthe boss's training is pretty tough!
5	1	Wha... So that really was just training?
6	ne1	Look! Thanks to your egotistical stunt,\nour beloved Levnises are useless\nhunks of junk!
7	ne1	How are you gonna make it up to\nus, eh?!
8	2	W-we didn't...
9	me1	You owe us two Levnises!\nThose things don't grow on trees!
10	he1	...
11	ne1	What? But Captain, they-
12	he1	...
13	ne1	U-understood... If that's what\nyou wish, Captain...
14	ne1	Listen up! If you fulfill one\ncondition, the captain's willing to\noverlook this outrage!
15	5	Condition?!
16	ne1	Our gracious captain wants\na rematch with you!
17	ne1	As such, we will allow you to take\nour place as the captain's training partners!
18	6	Huh, training? That's all we need to do?
19	ne1	That's all? That's all?!\nThis is a direct offer from the captain!!!
20	3	Will you quit shouting at everything\nfor Queen's sake?! You're doing my\nhead in!
21	he1	...
22	ne1	The captain is already prepared!\nHe commands you to begin immediately!
23	ne1	Prepare yourself for death! Prepare\nyourself for fatalities! Basically, you're\ngoing to die!
24	me1	Gahahaha! You're gonna work hard\nfor those Levnises you totaled!
25	4	...Well this is another fine mess\nyou've gotten us into, Eunie.
26	3	Yeah, yeah, it's all my fault! Arse.
evt/nq/msg_nq230403t.json
0	me1	Gahahaha!\nYou'd sure as snuff better do\nyour best to make the boss happy!
evt/nq/msg_nq230404t.json
0	ne1	Get to it!\nDon't keep the Captain waiting!
evt/nq/msg_nq230405f.json
0	3	(pant pant)\nS-so...had enough?
1	he1	...
2	5	This guy... We all hit him.\nHow can he still be going?
3	me1	Ha-hah! What are you blabbing\nabout?! The boss's cream crackered!
4	2	Is he, though? He looks right as rain!
5	ne1	Hmph, of course. A little thing like\npain is nothing to the captain.
6	4	Nothing...? You mean, he doesn't\nfeel any pain?
7	6	Is that even a thing?
8	me1	That's what everyone says!\nBut it's totally true!
9	he1	...
10	ne1	You don't say?! Is that true?!\nWhat amazing fortune!
11	3	He ain't speaking, though...
12	ne1	You mudders need to listen to\nthe knee-quivering honor you've\njust been bestowed!!!
13	ne1	The captain says that in that fight\nhe actually felt pain, trifling though it was!
14	6	And that means...?
15	me1	Gahaha! Well, in all his fights\nthe boss seeks to feel pain!
16	me1	Don't you think that not being\nable to feel pain is a travesty?
17	ne1	It's not just his sense of pain.\nAll of the Captain's physical\nsensations are dull.
18	ne1	The Captain has always told us that\nfeeling nothing at all means you\nmight as well be dead...
19	2	You're looking for pain so you\ncan feel like you're alive?
20	he1	...
21	ne1	Until today, the only one who could\ngive the Captain pain was none other\nthan Ashera...
22	me1	And now we have you guys!\nHa-hah, well done!
23	1	I, um. I see.\nGlad we could help?
24	3	Yeah. Huzzah.
25	ne1	What? You think this matter is all\ndone and dusted now, do you?
26	5	Queen preserve us, what now?
27	ne1	Listen up! Now we come to the\nmatter at hand!
28	ne1	The Captain tells us he requests\na re-rematch with you!
29	ne1	In return, you will be set up\nas the new commanders!
30	he1	...
31	3	Erm, you don't have to go that far...\nHonestly it seems kind of a hassle...
32	ne1	Whaaaat?!\nYou're just going to treat the Captain's\nkindness like it's nothing?!
33	3	I told you, stop shouting at\nevery little thing!!!
34	me1	Gahahaha! Now things are getting\ninteresting!
35	he1	...Heh.
evt/nq/msg_nq230500f.json
0	ne1	Ho there! What fortune, we were\njust looking for you!
1	3	Oh yeah? Glad you found us!\n...Well, we don't want to keep you-
2	ie1	Hey now, no need to give us the\nevil eye. Could you just hear us out?
3	5	Hm? Wait, aren't you from\nZoren's unit?
4	je1	Hehe... So, we meet again...
5	ne1	We've got some good news for such\nkind-hearted folks as yourselves, willing\nas you are to accept any request!
6	ne1	We need your help right away!\nDoesn't that make you beam with\nsatisfaction? Well?
7	4	Not entirely sure how to respond\nto this... Well, let's just hear what\nyou want.
8	ie1	The thing is, we have...well, Clad's unit\nhas an issue with deserters.
9	1	Deserters? They've fled the colony?
10	je1	Now that we have no Flame Clock,\npeople are free to stay or leave as\nthey please.
11	ie1	It might have something to do with\nKnoque's "training" being enough to\nmake me puke...
12	ie1	That would make anyone want to leave,\nright? In short, Knoque is facing the\nconsequences of his actions.
13	ne1	Be that as it may! We need to\nbring those cowards back and teach\nthem to remember their place in the world!
14	5	And did anyone manage to figure\nout where these deserters went?
15	je1	We're almost certain they went\ninto Maktha Wildwood.
16	1	Maktha, eh? If they've gone to\nground there then finding them will\nbe tricky.
17	ne1	That's right! We need some manpower\non the field! That's where you all come in!
18	ie1	Hunting in a forest is a whole different\nbeast though, you know.
19	ne1	You'll accept, won't you?!\nPlease say yes?!\nSay yes now!!!
20	5	Mate... What makes you think we'll\ndo anything you ask when you talk\nto us like that?
21	3	Knew there was no point in listening.\nGood luck to you folks, be seeing you!
22	ne1	Grrr...! Ghhh...!
23	ne1	Please! I'm begging you! If things stay\nlike this then I'll- No!
24	6	What was that...?
25	ie1	You see, Captain Clad may\nhave given our friend here an awful\nscolding.
26	je1	If he doesn't bring them back, then...\nWell, I'm sure you can imagine.
27	ie1	He's not even popular enough to muster\na search party. Perhaps that is why\nthose people left in the first place?
28	1	In other words, there's no one\nelse you can ask.
29	3	...Lame.
30	ne1	Gnnnnnngh!
31	6	I guess I feel sorry for him...\nA little.
32	3	(sigh) All right, I suppose\njust this once we can lend a hand.\nAs a favor.
33	1	R-right. Guess we can't just\nignore someone in need.
34	ne1	Y-you have my gratitude...\nTHANK YOU!!!
35	5	Could you try actually looking grateful?
36	ie1	Shall we set off? Time to begin\nour fun little task.
37	je1	Hehe... A pleasure to\nwork with you all again...
evt/nq/msg_nq230501f.json
0	1	So, what do we do?\nDon't tell me we just search\nplaces at random?
1	ne1	Of course not! Why do you think\nwe brought the others along?
2	ie1	I'm seeing tracks of several soldiers\npassing through here. Quite recently.
3	5	What tracks? I don't see anything.
4	ie1	As this sort of thing is my\nspecialty, I would hope not.
5	ie1	I don't believe they're simply running\naway. They're clearly trying to erase\ntheir footprints.
6	ie1	Still, the way I see it, they've\nbeen quite sloppy with their escape.\nThey've left such clear tracks...
7	ne1	We don't need a tedious commentary!\nJust follow the tracks!
8	ie1	Yes, yes, understood. Though I'll\nthank you not to raise your voice\nat every little thing.
9	ie1	I'll display the tracks in your Iris.\nPlease make sure you don't lose them.
evt/nq/msg_nq230502f.json
0	ie1	Ahh... Not good. No, not good at all.
1	ne1	What isn't good?!\nExplain yourself!!!
2	ie1	They've split into two groups.\nSeems someone knows a few basics\nabout confusing a tracker.
3	ne1	What impudence!!!
4	4	So do we split into two groups\nas well? Follow both tracks?
5	ie1	That's one way of doing it,\nbut I think I have a better idea.
6	ie1	How about it, partner?\nCan you pick up their scent?
7	je1	Indeed. It's all I need...
8	je1	The telltale rusty scent of anger and\nexcitement...and the tepid remains of\nconfusion and fear...
9	6	...I'm just getting grass and trees.
10	je1	In a state of emotional agitation, humans\ngive off powerful, unique aromas.
11	je1	Joy, anger, sadness. The smells\ndescribe these emotions most eloquently.\nTheir feelings are laid bare for me.
12	4	So you're saying you're\ntracking them by scent alone?
13	ie1	Isn't it astonishing? My partner's nose\nis as sensitive as a Volff's!
14	ie1	The smells even give her a good\nidea of their emotional state.
15	5	Whoa, crazy. It's like you're\nreading their minds...
16	ie1	Of course, most people found it somewhat\nunsettling and didn't like to approach her.
17	je1	Hehe... They didn't, did they?
18	ie1	And after a long struggle we misfits\nended up under Ashera...
19	ne1	Hey! This isn't the time to\nchat about the past! Which way\ndo we go? Left or right?!
20	ie1	Yes, we're coming to that, thank you.\nI'll leave it to you, partner.
21	je1	...Understood.
22	ie1	Having said that, their numbers are already\nthin on the ground, so I doubt they'll have\nsplit up. One of the tracks must be fake.
evt/nq/msg_nq230503f.json
0	pe1	What?! They caught up with us...!
1	qe1	Crap! Just a little more and we\ncould have got away!
2	ne1	All right you troublemakers!\nGet ready for a Knoqueing!
3	re1	Gaaah! Please spare us!
4	pe1	You fool! Our lives won't be\nworth living if we go back!
5	qe1	We've nothing else to lose!\nKill 'em!
6	5	Hey, just calm down!\nWe're not gonna do anything!
7	pe1	I'm gonna kill you! Gonna take you\ndown! Basically, you're gonna die!!!
8	ie1	Aha! There we have the fruits\nof your "training", eh, Knoque?
9	3	Forget that, how are we gonna\ndeal with this?
10	ne1	First we need to shut these fellows\nup. I know how much you all like to hold\nback, so that's your job!
11	3	You just gonna watch?
12	ne1	My Levnis is still being repaired!\nIf only a certain someone hadn't\nwrecked it!
13	3	All right, fine, yes, maybe we'll\njust take care of it then!
14	ie1	Though it grieves me, shall\nwe finish this little job?
15	je1	Hehe... Understood!
evt/nq/msg_nq230504f.json
0	pe1	It's over... We're done for...
1	ne1	Oh no it isn't! You're not getting\noff that easy!
2	ne1	Not until you work to clear Clad's unit\nof the shame with which you have\nsullied it!
3	ne1	And not before!!!
4	qe1	Aiiieee!
5	ne1	I'll break you, and you'll need\nmy training just to survive!\nYou will love my training and despair!
6	re1	P-please kill us! Have mercy!
7	je1	Amazing... I'm choking on the\nsweet musk of despair.
8	je1	Oh, it's intoxicating... My head is\ntingling... It won't stop!
9	je1	Hmm, tee hee hee...\nAaahahahahaha!
10	5	Mate. Your partner's seriously\nworrying me.
11	ie1	Oh, it's nothing too serious.\nShe'll be back to normal after\na short while.
12	3	These deserters worry me.\nFor slightly different reasons.
13	ie1	Even if our friends here had been lucky\nenough to escape us, where are they\ngoing to go?
14	ie1	They were palmed off on us in the first\nplace because they caused so much\ntrouble in their previous colonies.
15	ie1	No matter how they struggle, their\nonly place is with our colony. Much like\nmyself and my partner here.
16	5	Sounds like you're talking\nfrom experience.
17	ie1	Hahaha, far from it! I've always\nbeen an obedient soldier.
18	ie1	If I had to admit something, it's\nthat perhaps I have one too many\nthings to say.
19	je1	Especially when one of those things\nwas to publicly ridicule a superior.\nHehe... That was wonderful to see!
20	ie1	Ah! Welcome back, partner.\nYou were quicker to return to your\nsenses than usual.
21	je1	In Colony 11, you'll find that soldiers\nsuch as we are the norm, rather than\nthe exception.
22	je1	The fact that you are all rebels\nis only a trivial matter.
23	je1	Personally, I welcome such like-minded\npeople. Hehe...
24	3	If that's a joke, I ain't laughing.\nYou can count me out of your group.
25	je1	(sniff)
26	3	Wh-what?
27	je1	...Smells like a lie.
28	3	Wha...?!
29	je1	Hehe... See you again.
30	ie1	Well then. I hope we can all meet\nagain, if we all survive.
evt/nq/msg_nq230600f.json
0	M	Oho! Great timing! I was actually\nwaiting for you gentlefolk.
1	3	I must be losing it. Ain't we\nbeen through this before?
2	4	We have. Something tells me\nwe're not going to like what's next.
3	M	Oof, failed at the first hurdle.\nAnd here I wanted to invite you\njust because you're you.
4	6	What are you inviting us to?
5	3	Ack, don't-
6	M	A very good question! There's a\nregular event going on at the colony.\nNamely...
7	M	The "Battle To The Death to See Who's\nStrongest in Colony 11 Competition"!
8	5	The what now?
9	M	The "Everyone in Colony 11 Fights To The\nDeath For Fun Competition"!
10	2	That's a different name.
11	1	Putting aside the naming scheme for\nthe moment...it sounds like a mock battle\ninvolving every soldier in the colony?
12	M	Eh, more or less!
13	M	Not that some lukewarm mock battle\nis enough to satisfy our lot.
14	M	Especially now! Thanks to you lot,\neveryone's urge to kill is stronger than\never before! In a good way.
15	3	How do you tell the difference?
16	M	Look, people really want you to join.\nPlease? Go on, go a few rounds with\nthese lesser beings.
17	3	Why don't you just face off against\neveryone yourself? That's more your style.
18	M	Oh, I'm not taking part.
19	3	Whaaat? You're not planning on foisting\nsome crappy task on us while you\nwatch from a distance, are you?
20	M	Look, it's a competition to see who's\nthe strongest. What's the point in me\ntaking part when I'm already the best?
21	6	Yikes, you gotta admire her confidence.
22	M	So there you have it. This time\nI won't take my usual place by your side.
23	M	So this time your ringer\nhas to be someone else.
24	M	For example... Hah!
25	M	Like our Agnian Commander here,\ntrying so subtly to not be noticed!
26	2	Huh? You want Teach to...?
27	J	Oh? What is the meaning of this?
28	M	In my estimation, you're far better\nthan the other dreck you people\ncall commanders.
29	J	You give me too much credit.\nI'm just a lowly footsoldier, strictly\nmiddle-of-the-road.
30	M	Be humble all you want...\nBut I'm saying you're good.
31	J	...I feel as though you aren't going\nto take no for an answer.
32	M	Feel however you want.\nAs long as you participate\nit's all the same to me.
33	3	Is it cold here, or is it just me?
34	J	Very well. If you are going to insist\nthis much, then I cannot refuse.
35	M	Ah, good! Things will be even\nmore fun than before, and that's\nwhat I was after.
36	M	All right, talk to me when you're\nready. I'll be keeping a close eye\non the proceedings!
37	J	I'll be glad of your help, everyone.\nIf you decide to accept, I will devote\nevery fiber of my being to this.
38	3	Uh, yeah, sure.
39	5	Wait, hold up. When did we say\nwe were gonna join in on this?
40	4	A tad late to ask that now...
41	M	How about the commander of\nColony Gamma?
42	2	Teach?
43	3	Hold up, what are you\nplanning this time?
44	M	No need to be so guarded!\nI've just always found him interesting.
45	3	Whenever you act like nothing's\nup you've always got some scheme\nbrewin'.
46	M	Ah, Eunie gets it, as I should have\nexpected of her titanic brain.\n...Though it is a little complicated.
47	M	Actually, no, it's pretty straightforward.\nI just wanted to see if he could measure\nup. That's all, honestly.
48	2	...That said, Teach probably would accept.
49	M	Splendid! If you could bring him\nhere you'd make me very happy!
50	5	Wait, hold up. When did we say\nwe were gonna join in on this?
51	4	A tad late to ask that now...

6	M	Don't get me wrong, at first\nI wasn't going to do anything like this!
7	M	But seeing you come out on top,\nI just... It got my blood pumping.\nMaybe some demon's possessed me?
8	J	You're lying.
9	2	Teach...?
10	J	This is what you wanted to do\nfrom the very beginning. Am I wrong?
11	J	If you thought you hid your murderous\nspirit and lust for battle, then may I\nsuggest you require more mental training?
12	M	Ahahaha! Harsh, but fair.\nPerhaps I do need a bit of reflection.
13	M	But why should I?\nWhy should I listen to you,\nof all people?
14	6	H-hey...!
15	M	I wonder what kind of monster is\nlurking under that calm facade...
16	J	...Would you like to see?
17	5	Wait, Teach, are you really\ngonna fight her?
18	M	Hehe... I knew this moment would\ncome, right when I first saw you...
19	M	Deep down, Commander,\nyou're like me.
20	M	All of you should join your friend\nthe commander. I don't want you\nto hold back.
21	J	Oh dear. It seems you are beyond saving.
22	J	I tell you this: someday your\nlimitless arrogance will destroy you.
23	3	Mio, what's going on with Teach?
24	2	I don't think he'll answer me...
25	M	Well, I'd better go warm up\nbefore our match.
26	M	I'll set up an agent to observe things,\nso you just make sure you're prepared.

2		Yes
3	he1	...
4	3	Yeah, I know. We have to bring\nTeach along.
5		No
evt/nq/msg_nq230611f.json
0	M	When I last fought you, I was being\ncontrolled by W. I didn't get the chance\nto enjoy anything.
1	M	Now we can forget everything else\nand revel in this fight to the death.
2	J	Hmph. I wonder how long you can\nstay this complacent. I'm interested\nin finding out.
3	M	Hahaha, yes! Push me to the limit!
4	M	There's no need for me to go all\nout if you don't push me.
5	3	Teach, careful. I know she's got\na mouth, but her strength's the real deal.
6	J	Yes, I am aware of that. If we hold back,\nwe are lost. We must focus.
7	J	Now...it begins!
evt/nq/msg_nq230612f.json
0	1	Ashera really is powerful...\nAs if we didn't know after last time.
1	J	...
2	M	...
3	3	...Hm?
4	J	I take it that by sheathing your Blade,\nyou wish to surrender?
5	M	What are you saying?\nYou know perfectly well what it means.
6	M	If we carry on, one of our husks\nwill be bleaching on the ground.
7	J	...I am surprised. Didn't you wish\nfor a bloody fight to the finish?
8	M	My life doesn't belong to just me.\nI have to choose the right moment\nto lay it down.
9	3	...
10	M	Well, whatever. I offer my surrender.\nBut tell me one thing, in return.
11	J	...Name it.
12	M	I might be misremembering, but...
13	M	I don't think this is the first time I've\nfought to the death with you like this...\nWhat do you think?
14	J	...
15	J	As you say, you must be mistaken.
16	J	This is the first time I have faced you.
17	M	...I see. It sounds right, now you've said it.
18	M	I thought somehow I'd seen a face like\nyours before, but your name is different.\nNatural to mix them up.
19	J	...
20	M	Putting these little details aside, I praise\nyou all. That was a fight without equal.
21	J	I am honored. This was a good\nopportunity to hone my skills.
22	M	...You're living a feckless life.
23	J	I could say the same of you.
24	M	Heh. Maybe you're right.
25	3	Queen's paninis, please tell me this\nis over now. I'm knackered!
26	3	I think, um... I'm sorry we got\nyou involved in this, Teach.
27	J	Not at all. This event had a lot of\nmeaning for me.
28	J	Even in Agnus, Colony 11 is notorious-\nExcuse me...
29	J	I should say they're noted for their bravery.\nTo take part in one of their mock battles is\nan experience not many can boast.
30	jn1	The same is true here, general of Agnus.
31	3	Ugh, you lot...
32	fe1	Your duel with Ashera was truly\na thing of beauty.
33	fe1	But I cannot let you leave, not\nuntil you face me, Zoren, again!
34	3	You what?! What the spark are you\nblathering about? No! NO!
35	ge1	What hunter would withdraw\nbefore their prey?
36	he1	...
37	J	Hmm. It seems I lit a fire in you all\nwithout intending to. Most vexing.

0	ve1	Oh, hey there! I sure didn't think I'd\nbump into you guys here.
1	1	Hey Sigrún! Good to see you again!
2	5	This gate had been closed for spark\nknows how long, right? Are you the\none who opened it?
3	ve1	I am. Castle orders had forbade\nopening it, until then.
4	ve1	Putting Colony 11 under quarantine for\n"contamination" by you Ouroboros was\na shamefully foolish thing for me to do.
5	3	C'mon, what else could you've done in\nthat situation? It was what it was. Chill.
6	ve1	I'd love to speak with you more, but,\nunfortunately, I have something urgent to\ndeal with. I need to head back right away.
7	ve1	Oh, and if you happen to spot Zoren,\ncould you do me a solid, and tell him\nto come to see me?
8	3	Zoren? Um, sure, I guess...
9	ve1	Cheers! You guys are such a big help!
evt/nq/msg_nq230701f.json
0	fe1	Well. I certainly didn't expect the likes\nof you lot to come and speak to me...
1	3	'Cause you know full well how much\nof a pain in the arse you are? That's\nbeside the point, though...
2	3	You know Sigrún, the Captain of the Guard?\nShe wants you at her office, pronto.
3	fe1	...Heh. And I certainly didn't think I'd hear\nthat name come out of your mouth, either.
4	3	Sounds like you two are acquainted.\nSo, what's Sigrún to you?
5	fe105fe10	This is Zoren. All squads suspend all\nduties. Assemble for an emergency\nsummons!
6	3	Hey, are you even listening...?!
7	fe103fe10	...Not a problem. Easel and Clad\nhave also been informed... That's the\nkind of deal we're looking at here.
8	fe107fe10	...Yes, it's a summons from her.\nThere'll be no latecomers in this\nmission, so get to it!
9	3	Hey, who were you just call-
10	me1	Gahaha! One Rattlejack present,\njust as you ordered, Captain Zor!
11	5	I remember you from Clad's squad!\nWhy've you suddenly decided to\nrock up here?
12	le1	This is a special summons from Zoren\nwe're talking about here. Of course we\ncan't just ignore it!
13	ke1	Heh, guess we can't. You idiots can barely\nfunction without having every little thing\nexplained in agonizing detail, after all.
14	4	What's going on? You're from Easel's\nsquad, is that right?
15	le1	Wait, didn't I tell you? Me,\nHexen, and Jack were originally-
16	fe1	Enough idle talk.\nWe're to head to the fort at once.
17	ke1	Fort O'Virbus, right? Can't wait to see\nwhat fun happenings we have to look\nforward to there!
18	me1	'Fraid we gotta skedaddle, Ouroboros! But\ndon't worry! I'll sure we'll have barrels\nof fun next time we meet up! Gahaha!
19	1	Th-that was really something... What\non Aionios is going on at the fort?
20	4	I'm not sure... But what I do know is that\ntrouble and disorder are never far off\nwhen they get involved.
21	6	I do hope Sigrún's all right...
22	2	...
23	3	...C'mon, then. Let's go see what all\nthe fuss is about.
evt/nq/msg_nq230702f.json
0	ve1	Oh, if isn't you guys. Thanks a ton\nfor the getting the message out.
1	ve1	And if you don't mind me saying,\nyou're all looking pretty pale. What\nhappened between then and now?
2	6	Umm...
3	3	We called these guys over just like\nyou told us to, but...are you really\nsure about this?
4	ve1	Hm? Sure about what?
5	ve1	Ahh! I get you now.
6	ve1	Seems like the Ouroboros really know\nwhat makes you guys tick, eh?
7	fe1	Was that an attempt at humor?\nWhat drivel.
8	ve1	Relax, you guys. You're well within\nyour rights to be concerned, I know.
9	ve1	But the reason I called Zoren and his\nsquad over is to help me out with a\ncertain little job.
10	1	What job?
11	ve1	The kind of massively important job only\n*they* are capable of pulling off.
12	ve1	A job made for the guards' vanguard:\nthe Antares squad.
13	5	...Wait, did I hear that right?
14	2	Hold on. By "they", you don't mean...?
15	3	Oh, pull the other one! I thought they\nwere supposed to be Colony 11 soldiers,\nweren't they?!
16	le1	I was cut off from saying it earlier, but\nwe were originally part of the Guard.
17	le1	Officially, we work for Colony 11, but\neven now, we get the occasional personal\nrequest from the captain here.
18	ve1	It may be hard to believe, but it's true.\nAmong the Guard, they were the elite\nof the elite.
19	ke1	What she said. In a better, fairer world,\nI might've even been your superior, making\nyou guys my little subordinates, you know.
20	3	I'm just going to pretend I didn't hear\nthat... A-anyway, what's this "job" you\nmentioned earlier?
21	ve1	Ah, of course. Sorry, I was going to\nexplain, but then we got sidetracked.
22	ve1	First, we'll need a change of location.\nFollow me.
evt/nq/msg_nq230703f.json
0	fe1	Hmph. I knew the Castle must have had\nsomething to do with why you called us\nover here.
1	ve1	True, but also, I need to avoid exposing\nembarrassing slip-ups in public.
2	2	Slip-ups?
3	ve1	A few days ago, a section of the Guard\nstarted an armed uprising, and holed\nthemselves up in the Castle.
4	1	A-armed uprising...? Wh-what?
5	ve1	Yes. They've taken over a section of the\nCastle, but they haven't got any further\nsince then. It's a stalemate situation.
6	me1	A takeover! Now you have my attention!
7	1	I'm just surprised that a rebel element\ncould even arise within the Guard.
8	ve1	You say that, but their fierce loyalty to the\nQueen is exactly why many of the Guard\ncan't accept that they were loyal to a fake.
9	ve1	There are four sergeants at the vanguard\nof this rebel movement to seize the Castle.
10	ve1	They've proclaimed themselves as the\nQueen's "Four Divine Wings", and have\nmade two demands of me.
11	4	The "Four Divine Wings"...\nA haughty, high-handed name\nif there ever was one.
12	5	What are they demanding, then?
13	ve1	To transfer command of the Guard to\nthem...and to hand over the Ouroboros.
14	2	Us?
15	ve1	"This upheaval of Aionios lies solely at the\nhands of those treacherous Ouroboros. It is\nthe Queen's wish to see them purged."
16	ve1	This was the declaration of one of the\nsergeants. Naturally, I have zero intention\nof yielding to either one of their demands.
17	fe1	Hmph... I saw this coming.
18	fe1	If we aren't going to give them what\nthey want, then we'll have to bring\nthose rapscallions to heel, won't we?
19	fe1	I get why you brought us in for this\njob now... Seeing as we're no longer\npart of the Guard and all.
20	fe1	If the current Guard were to fight their own\nfellows, the internal division it would cause\ncould be catastrophic for the organization.
21	ve1	...Yeah, you read that right.
22	ve1	I came to the conclusion that only you\nguys, outsiders with inside knowledge,\ncould do this.
23	fe1	Heh. Still, making us fight our old\ncomrades... Who knew you could\nbe so unscrupulous?
24	fe1	But I've no objection!\nI shall gladly accept this job.
25	me1	We just love ourselves a bit of dirty work!\nNothing like writing off any craziness we\nget up to as an "accident"!
26	le1	I'm raring to give those holier-than-thou\npretenders the wake-up call of their lives!
27	1	Hey, wait a moment! Maybe you could\nlet us help you out with this job?
28	fe1	Hm?
29	ve1	I appreciate the thought, but if you join in,\nit means you also take on responsibility\nfor the mission, you know?
30	1	Yes, of course. We know that, but it's just...\nwell, you see...
31	3	If you won't spit it out, I will, Noah. We're\nworried about what'll happen if we aren't\nthere to keep those nutters in check.
32	le1	Hahaha, you're worrying yourselves over\nnothing. You won't get most things done\nif you don't pull out all the stops.
33	ke1	Not much difference between "bringing them\nto heel" and just killing them all, really.\nHehe... They won't stand a chance.
34	ve1	...I see your point. Accompany them, and\nmake sure to keep them in line, OK?
35	1	Of course. We'll make sure they\ndon't raise too much trouble.
36	4	Just to be sure, our mission is to suppress\nthe rebel forces, and make sure their\nleaders come back alive, not dead, right?
37	ve1	Yeah, that's the gist of it. I know it's odd\nto say now that I've dragged you guys into\nthis, but I owe you one... I really do.
38	fe1	If we're done briefing here, we will sortie\nat once.
39	5	Any ideas on how we're gonna find these\n"Four Divine Wings"? It's not like we even\nknow where they're holed up in the Castle.
40	fe1	Our enemies are the ones\nwe meet in battle.
41	fe1	We need only scour the battlefield\nclean to find the scum we're after.
evt/nq/msg_nq230704t.json
0	ve1	I want the four sergeants behind this\nuprising to be captured and as unscathed\nas possible.
1	ve1	Keep a watchful eye on all soldiers in\nthe Antares squad... Sorry to put it on\nyou, but I would really appreciate it.
evt/nq/msg_nq230705f.json
0	fe1	...And that's everything dealt with, Captain.
1	ve1	Yeah. We just got done putting the\nsurrenderers into custody.
2	fe1	You've gone soft. Kill off a turncoat,\nand you kill off any little worries about\nthem doing it again. Peace of mind!
3	ve1	I'm Captain of the Guard here.\nI get to decide what becomes of them.
4	fe1	Hah! So the weak, indecisive soldier\nspeaks like she's all grown-up now.
5	ve1	I've had to endure more than my fair\nshare of tough situations, you know...\nEver since you left, all that time ago.
6	fe1	Good. Then keep on maturing and growing.\nYou wouldn't want your subordinates to\nmake a mockery of you now, would you?
7	fe1	My job here is done.\nI'll be returning to Colony 11.
8	ve1	Hold up, Zoren!
9	ve1	...Come back to the Guard.\nWe need your like more now than ever.
10	ve1	And besides... By rights, you\nshould be Captain of the Guard...
11	fe1	...Just as I was starting to think you had\nmatured a little, it turns out you're still the\nsame person I remember from long ago.
12	fe1	However...that should mean you already\nknow what my answer is going to be.
13	fe1	Isn't that right, Sig?
14	ve1	...
15	fe1	The next theater of operations you have\nfor me had better be something with a\nbit of bite to it, OK?
16	fe1	A challenge that I can throw everything\nI have and more into. You got that?
evt/nq/msg_nq240100s.json
0	5	Hey, what's up with those soldiers training\nat Fort O'Virbus? They seem kinda weird.
1	6	Define weird.
2	5	It's like, they're always talking down to\neveryone like they're something special.
3	3	Yeah, they're a cheeky lot.
4	4	You're one to talk.
5	3	Shut it, you.
6	3	Honestly, though, I can't be\ndoing with people like that.
7	1	It's probably got something to do\nwith all the lectures the cadets on the\nexecutive ladder have to sit through.
8	6	That seems kind of...unreliable?
9	5	Yeah, first sign of a real battle\nand they'll be stuffed.
10	3	Absolutely up the creek.
11	4	But what can we do about that?
12	5	...We could challenge them! Eh? Eh?
13	4	Explain.
14	5	Think about it. If we can wreck 'em\nin a fight, we can crush the attitude\nproblems right out of 'em!
15	3	I'm with Lanz. We've gotta teach\nthem how to be better. It's for their\nown good.
16	4	This is a ludicrous idea.
17	5	Then it's settled. We're going to\nFort O'Virbus and we're gonna hunt\ndown those rude mudders!
evt/nq/msg_nq240101f.json
0	_e1	We should've done it like this all along.
1	Wf1	No... No, I don't think so. See, it'll\njust slow the advance way down.
2	Xf1	And that's exactly why I suggested\ndeploying a Levnis from the start.
3	5	Hey.
4	_e1	Who are you?
5	2	Well, we're-
6	Xf1	Wait... The Captain of the Guard\nmentioned these guys, didn't she?
7	Wf1	Oh right, the ones who defeated the\nConsul at the Castle and broke the\nFlame Clock.
8	_e1	They're the Ouroboros?!
9	5	So you've heard of us.\nThat makes things easy.
10	5	Rumor has it that you\nlot are pretty clever.
11	Xf1	Haha! That we are.
12	Wf1	We're the best of the best. No one in\nall Keves can hold a candle to us!
13	_e1	We can overtake soldiers like you from\nlow-ranking colonies in less than a year.
14	2	Low-ranking...?
15	3	Ooh, they do have a mouth on them.
16	5	What a joke.
17	_e1	...Sorry?
18	5	So, if you were to take us on in a fight,\nyou'd rinse us, would you?
19	_e1	Correct. If that's what you want, we'll\ngive you a fight, any time, any place.
20	5	Oh, it is ON!
21	5	How d'you like the sound\nof a monster-bashing battle?
22	_e1	Go on.
23	_e1	We'll show you more than just knowledge.\nWe'll show you the meaning of excellence.
24	Xf1	We've only got three people, though.
25	Xf1	So how about this? Five monsters\nfor us, and ten for you.
26	3	Sounds fair.
27	_e1	We can compare results\nback here once we're done.
28	5	You're on!
29	_e1	Then let the game begin!
evt/nq/msg_nq240102f.json
0	3	Oh, look who's not back yet!
1	5	Haha, we won! Suck on that!
2	Xf1	Now where are those\nspare ether cylinders...
3	5	And what time do you call this?
4	Xf1	No! How can you be back already?!
5	3	Because we're finished!
6	Xf1	Ugh! We would have won if we\nhadn't run out of supplies!
7	Wf1	I refuse to accept this!\nI demand a rematch!
8	_e1	Leave it. We have to accept that we\nmessed up. We didn't prepare properly.
9	5	...Huh. Didn't expect you\nto be so gracious about it.
10	_e1	It's not so surprising, is it?\nCastle soldiers are trained not to\nmake the same mistake twice.
11	Xf1	Exactly! And we want to be like\nthe Captain of the Guard!
12	Xf1	We can't let a failure like this\nget us down!
13	_e1	There's a degree of shame, yes, but it\nwas a good lesson. So thanks for that.
14	Wf1	When are you going to be back?\nWe've got a score to settle now!
15	5	You know what...\nMaybe you lot are all right.
16	1	Haha! We'll have to stay at the top\nof our game, won't we, Lanz?
17	1	They learn by trial and error.\nWe could do worse than emulate them.
18	4	Your ridiculous idea turned out to be\npretty useful to your little protégés in\nthe end.
19	5	Protégés?!
20	5	I never thought of anyone as my\nprotégé before, not even in Colony 9.
21	5	I don't think I'm much cut out\nto be a mentor, but eh, why not!\nIt's something to do!
22	5	Hey, you lot!
23	_e1	What now?
24	5	Let's do this again sometime!
25	_e1	...Ha, yeah, we'll look forward to it.
26	Wf1	But next time, you're\nthe ones going down!

3	4	I wouldn't say so. That wasn't the\nimpression I got from observing the fort.

3	ve1	Oh, there you are!\nI didn't think you'd come!
4	1	We heard that you were looking for us.
5	ve1	Right you are! It shouldn't take long\nto explain, and it'll really help us out.
6	ve1	You might already know that\nthe Guard is soon going to start\na large-scale training exercise.
7	2	Yes, we'd heard something to that effect.
8	ve1	Not to put too fine a point on it, but I'd\nlike to ask you to help with the training.
9	3	Us? Really?
10	ve1	The Queen in the Castle was a fake.
11	ve1	But we never doubted her. We blindly\naccepted that imitation and betrayed\nthe real Queen's hopes.
12	ve1	But you, you're stronger than that. You\ncan show us the proper way to train.
13	3	The Guard's those fancy troops who\ncontrol the Castle grounds, yeah?
14	5	Problem is, we can't go easy on\nelites like them, training or not.
15	1	We can't, and we won't.
16	5	Huh? What, we're actually doing this?
17	1	Things must be tough at the Castle what\nwith everything going on right now.
18	5	Fair point... Not really much room\nto complain then, I guess.
19	ve1	You'll help, then?
20	ve1	Brilliant! Hopefully this will get\nthem working better together.
21	3	What's going on? You got, like,\ndissent in the ranks?
22	ve1	Sadly, yes.
23	ve1	The Guard is split into two units.
24	ve1	Soltnar Squad and Khatorl Squad.\nLet's just say the two of them aren't\nthe best of friends right now.
25	ve1	We're hoping that this training will remind\nthem of the importance of teamwork.
26	1	Right, understood.\nWe'll see what we can do, then.

4	xe1	As far as I'm concerned, there's no\nhigher honor than getting to train\nwith the illustrious Ouroboros.
5	xe1	I'm not convinced we'll win, but by the\nQueen we'll give it everything we've got.
6	we1	Tch, losing before you've\neven started. What idiocy.
7	xe1	I say you're the idiot here. Underestimating\nan opponent like this only invites disaster.\nFalse bravado is a poor strategy indeed.
8	we1	You shut your mouth!
9	3	...This is what the captain\nwas talking about, I see.
10	1	Shall we kick off the training?
11	xe1	Sorry, this is very unprofessional.
12	xe1	Let me explain the exercise.
13	xe1	We'll be split into two teams, one\non the offense and one defense.
14	xe1	The Attackers win if they manage\nto take control of this area.
15	xe1	The Defenders, on the other hand,\nwill need to incapacitate all members\nof the opposing side.
16	xe1	Of course, as the Guard, we'll\nbe taking the defensive position.\nSo that leaves you to attack.
17	1	Sounds good.
18	we1	I know very well that you're\nstronger than the norm...
19	we1	But I'm not going to give up my position\nas the first guard unit so easily!
20	G	This promises to be exciting!
21	xe1	There's hardly a Volff's whisker\nbetween the first and second units.
22	6	OK, so, you're both really great?
23	1	Is everybody ready?
24	we1	Let's get this done!
evt/nq/msg_nq240204f.json
0	xe1	That was...more intense...than I expected...
1	we1	Gah! So that's what Ouroboros\nis like up close and personal...!
2	5	Speak for yourselves.\nYou ain't slouches.
3	G	Yes, you show promise.
4	xe1	We're all strong individually, but much\nmore when we work together. I'd almost\nforgotten the importance of that.
5	we1	Pah, we work perfectly well together in\nour squad! We've never lost a single-
6	we1	...Oop!
7	xe1	Heath...
8	we1	Ugh, yeah, OK...
9	we1	Soltnar Squad, Khatorl Squad...\nGuess I can't deny that we're all\ncut from the same cloth.
10	we1	Thanks for the reminder.
11	2	Really, there's no need.
12	we1	Oh, but there is! I'll re-examine my\nformations and strategies while this bitter\ndefeat remains fresh in my mind!
13	3	Heh, guy's got spirit. I like him.
14	we1	Hey, how long are you going\nto lollygag around? Hop to it!
15	ff1	Ugh...hnghhhhh...
16	we1	Wynonna, you get over here too!
17	6	Well, he seems more chirpy than\nbefore the training exercise...
18	xe1	I think some things finally clicked\nin that fight with you.
19	xe1	There was something missing in him-\nno, in the whole of the Guard.
20	xe1	I can't thank you enough for today.\nWe'll have to really hone our skills\nif we want to get the better of you.
21	5	And that's that.
22	1	Yeah...
23	5	...Reminds you of us, doesn't it?
24	1	Oh?
25	5	You know, how we all tried to take\non too much ourselves, and all that.
26	1	Yeah, I can see where you're coming from.
27	ve1	That all went great, I thought.\nGreat training. Great battle, even.
28	5	Were you watching?
29	ve1	I caught the tail end of it. But still!
30	ve1	Thanks to you, I think both Heath\nand Wynonna learned the aspects\nthey need to improve upon.
31	ve1	We the Guard are tasked with protecting\nthe Queen's person and what she stands for,\nso we need to be stronger than the rest.
32	ve1	But that doesn't mean just\nindividual strength.
33	ve1	When you can truly accept your peers,\nwarts and all, that's when you see the\nbeginnings of strength.
34	6	So...it's like you need to have\nsome kind of special bond?
35	ve1	A "bond"... Yes, that's\na good way to put it.
36	ve1	It may sound trite, but I think\nthere's a greater strength than\njust tactics and theory.
37	1	Sounds like you getting us to work\nwith Heath and Wynonna was a huge\nsuccess.
38	ve1	Hahaha! Not at all.
39	ve1	You lot are the real heroes here.\nReally, thank you, Ouroboros.
40	ve1	Anyway, I'd better go and see how my\nvaliant subordinates are holding up.
41	3	Don't work them too hard!
42	5	And tell them we'll beat 'em\nagain next time and all!
evt/nq/msg_nq240400s.json
0	4	I hear some strange individual has\nbeen creating some sort of colorful\npicture at Fort O'Virbus.
1	3	Oh yeah, they call 'em "paintings", right?\nI heard about that from Monica.
2	3	It's that culture thing they're\nalways banging on about.
3	2	You don't really get people making...\npaintings...like that in Keves.
4	1	Yeah, I thought only City folk\ndid that kind of thing.
5	4	What would you say to a field trip?\nI can't deny, my interest is piqued.
6	3	Hold the Iris. No-nonsense Taion\nwants a nosy just for the spark of it?
7	4	For the record, Eunie, I don't\nlive entirely by the book.
8	1	No objections here. Let's see what\nwe can see at Fort O'Virbus.
evt/nq/msg_nq240401f.json
0	se1	Sigh...
1	2	Excuse me, but are you the person that's\nbeen making a painting around here?
2	se1	SIIIGH.
3	1	A-are you OK?
4	se1	Will you listen to my tale of woe?
5	se1	I was once a soldier who attended\nConsul K, so that I might capture his\nlikeness within a portrait.
6	3	Are portraits different\nfrom normal paintings?
7	se1	Portraits are a type of painting!
8	se1	I painted K as I was ordered.\nIt was my sacred duty!
9	se1	And then one day I heard that K had fallen\nto some ruffians called "Ouroboros"...\nMy life's purpose, vanished like smoke...
10	3	Life's purpose? Spare me...
11	se1	However! My passion undimmed,\nI returned to the Castle, where\nthere could yet be a Consul.
12	se1	Yet every day my talent is mocked.\n"How can an image fell an enemy\nsoldier?" they jeer, vulgarly.
13	se1	Not a soul remains in all Aionios\nwho appreciates my art!
14	3	I've not heard of any.
15	se1	But enough of my sorrowful\ntale. Who are you?
16	1	We're-
17	se1	Wait! No! You're the Ouroboros!
18	4	Don't worry, we mean you no harm.
19	4	We were only wondering if you\nwouldn't mind showing us your\npainting...this portrait, I mean.
20	se1	N-no, I don't mind...
21	4	I see. The figure of a person, rendered\nin colored dyes using a soft brush on a\nmaterial called canvas...
22	4	That's a portrait, is it?
23	se1	That's right. And portrait-painting\nforms part of "culture". It's a concept\nK educated me in.
24	se1	But hoi polloi soldiers ascribe no value\nto it, and so I have returned to the Castle\nin slender hope of succor...
25	5	But if no one's buying,\nyou're in a tight spot, eh?
26	se1	Exactly, yes.
27	3	Well, I don't think culture's gonna\ndo much good when you're risking\nyour neck out on the front lines.
28	1	Hmm, culture...
29	1	Wait, Eunie. You said Monica had been\ntalking to you about culture before?
30	3	Mm? Oh, yeah. And?
31	se1	Can such a thing be true?!
32	3	Yeah, there's a Nopon in the City\nwho knows all about that kind of\nstuff. Wellwell, I think.
33	3	I bet Wellwell would know all about that\nkind of stuff. He's a Nopon from the City,\nso it figures.
34	se1	The City? I have never heard of such\na colony, but something about the name\ncertainly smacks of culture...
35	se1	Very well, then!
36	se1	Would you be so kind as to show\nmy little daubs in this City of yours?
37	5	I don't remember signing up for-
38	se1	Surely such discerning folk shall be\nable to value my art at its true worth!
39	se1	And if not...if not then I shall simply...
40	3	OK, OK, save the waterworks.
41	2	Let's do it. Poor thing looks like\nhe's at the end of his tether.
42	3	Ugh, fine.
43	se1	Oh, thank you, thank you!
44	se1	I shall entrust you with\nmy precious portrait.
45	1	OK, let's get this valued\nat Wellwell's shop.
46	se1	This is the piece I have most faith in,\namong all of my work! All my hopes go\nwith you!
evt/nq/msg_nq240402f.json
0	al1	Welcome to shop of Wellwell!
1	1	Hi, Wellwell. We've actually brought\nsomething we'd like you to take a look\nat, if you've got a moment.
2	al1	You not customer today?
3	1	Well... Take a look.
4	al1	Ah, is portrait! Sometimes we arrange\nhandling of such thing in shop.
5	1	This was painted by a Kevesi.\nHe'd like to have its value appraised.
6	5	We ain't got a clue ourselves.
7	al1	It certainly long time since Wellwell\nsee art of people outside City...
8	al1	Wellwell overcome with sudden\ninquisitivity! Leave painting with\nWellwell for further investigate.
9	5	Cheers for being so quick about it.
10	al1	Oho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
11	2	Wh-what is it?
12	5	Hey, don't laugh.\nThe guy was trying his best.
13	al1	This portrait, it total piece of...
14	6	That bad...?
15	al1	No, total piece of masterpiece!\nIs perfection!
16	al1	Subject is...meh, but boldness of\nbrushstroke! Innovation of palette!
17	al1	If Wellwell ascribe value of fiscal nature\nto work, then 200,000G is piddling bargain!
18	5	That much?!
19	5	Two hundred grand, for these squiggles?!
20	al1	That very rude!
21	al1	Artist of this portrait is\ntalent of rare genius!
22	4	I knew it had to be something special,\nbut this far defied my expectations.
23	3	What are you so happy about?
24	1	Let's give Stefaan the good news, then.
25	al1	You not selling piece?
26	1	Well, we haven't asked the\nartist if he wants to sell.
27	al1	Wellwell understand. Let Wellwell provide\nofficial stamped report of valuation.
28	al1	That guarantee good for\neverywhere in Aionios.
29	1	Thank you!
evt/nq/msg_nq240403f.json
0	se1	Ah, you're back!\nI was in an agony of waiting!
1	se1	Tell me...have you any news to report?
2	1	Well...
3	se1	200,000G?!
4	5	Yeah, we couldn't believe it either.\nAll that dosh for one little picture.
5	se1	How can I possibly thank you?!
6	se1	What price, faith in oneself? How can\none value the knowledge that other\npeople appreciate one's art?!
7	1	So what do you want to do with the\nportrait? You could sell it, or keep it.
8	se1	I know exactly what I shall do!
9	se1	I shall gift it to you!
10	3	Are you sure about that, mate?
11	se1	'Tis but a small token of my gratitude for\nresolving the problem that had been\ngnawing at my heart!
12	6	What problem?
13	se1	The problem of passion!
14	se1	The passion inspired by a work of art\nis the most important aspect of culture!
15	se1	I used to have K to opine upon my work\nand feed my passion for the arts.
16	se1	After his untimely passing, there was none\nleft to confront the true meaning of my\nwork. I was half-resigned to obscurity...
17	se1	However! You hand me this judgment of\nabundant value! The passion I had lost\nreturns tenfold, overflowing my heart!
18	3	I'm getting about one word in ten.
19	2	You model your portraits\non real people, don't you?
20	2	Who will you paint next?
21	se1	Hmmm... This will be my first comeback\nwork, so I should take someone brimming\nwith personality to be my model...
22	5	Wait, are you going to paint us?
23	se1	Mmm, no, you're too fierce\nof spirit, too bestial to be the\nsubject of my portrait.
24	se1	What I want to paint is someone who...\nwho appears weak at first glance, but\nhas a core of strength within!
25	3	Yeaaah, that rules out us six then.
26	1	Then why don't we get one of the\ncommanders involved, or one of the\nothers who've agreed to help us?
27	se1	That would be wonderful!\nI am in your debt!
28	1	We'll see if we can find anyone who looks\npromising, and bring them back here.
29	se1	I shall await your return!
evt/nq/msg_nq240404t.json
0	se1	I have been waiting to behold such\nelegance and grace! Yes, I shall paint you\nfor the work after my next work!
1	se1	Yes, the one after the next,\nI think. Not this one, though.
2	7	Hah, all right. Then I look forward to\nbeing painted for the portrait after your\nnext portrait.
3	se1	Oh, a pair of Nopon!
4	se1	I'm afraid I have trouble\ndistinguishing Nopon...
5	8	Inconceivable. How you not able to\ntell apart Riku from this titchypon?!
6	9	Who you calling titchypon?!
7	se1	Ah, you've brought me an illustrious\ntactician, by the dignity of his expression...\nBut he differs from my desired image.
8	A	I wouldn't dare call myself a tactician\nin the presence of Taion here.
9	A	But I was quite flattered at\nthe idea of having my portrait\npainted. Ah well, shame.
10	se1	Oh, so close to my ideal portrait subject!\nBut I'd like just a smidge more strength\nto inspire the soldiers...
11	B	I'm terribly sorry...!
12	se1	Such daring! He's the exact\nopposite of your humble, timid artist!
13	se1	I fear I am not the right man to\ndo you justice upon the canvas.
14	C	...I can't say I follow, but I will strive\nto be the man you perceive me as.
15	se1	You aren't Kevesi, if I'm not mistaken,\nand yet your mien suggests you've\nseen many battles.
16	se1	I rather had someone a little\nmore delicate in mind, alas.
17	D	Ah, shame that.
18	D	I'm interested to see what kind of art\nsprings up outside the City, though.
19	se1	Such a noble personage of Agnus!\nAnd yet there is something almost\nlacking in the deportment...
20	F	...
21	se1	O-oh...that is certainly an expressive\nglare... I...I feel like our collaboration\nis, er, not fated to be, this time!
22	se1	Ah, is this the replacement Queen for the\nfalse one which you toppled so mightily?
23	se1	Hahaha, nobody likes an impostor!
24	G	He refers to the fake who stole my\nthrone so long ago...? Well, nothing\nto be done about it, I suppose.
25	se1	Whoa, that right hand of yours isn't an\noff-the-shelf model, is it? Is that original?
26	H	Heh, this is the hand\nmy masterpon gave me!
27	se1	To my untrained eye, it is a work of prime\ncraftsmanship. Alas, I am not familiar with\npainting Levnises, so must refrain.
28	H	Oh? Well, if you say so...
29	H	Thanks for the kind words, and\nsorry I can't be of more use!
30	se1	Such awe! Such a commanding presence!\nThe epitome of a commander! Sadly, this\ndoes not match my vision.
31	I	You think I have a commanding\npresence? You're an odd one.
32	I	Sorry I couldn't be of help, but\nI hope your efforts bear fruit.
33	se1	Oh... I can feel a terrible pressure\nlurking in his smile...!
34	J	Hah hah, I can assure you my\nsmile contains no such thing.
35	J	If I can be useful to you,\nI would gladly work with you.
36	se1	I...I'm far too shy to be equal to\nthis task! I'll decline this time!
37	se1	Gah! I quiver under that\nbewildering gaze...!
38	se1	And yet! In my next work,\nI wish to emphasize kindness!
39	K	You don't find me to be kind?\nYou wound me, sir...
40	4	Don't get him wrong - he just means\nyou don't match his vision.
41	K	...I know, I was just joking.
42	K	See? You could look to Taion for kindness.\nThe answer was staring you in the face.
43	se1	Yes! Yes! You fit my vision exactly...!
44	1	Have we managed it...?!
45	se1	However! Hmmm, the ears are just a\nliiittle bit... They just don't harmonize\nwith the motif of the whole...
46	se1	Sorry for being rude. I don't\nsuppose the ears...come off?
47	L	No.
48	se1	Understood...
49	se1	What's that they call you?\n"The suicidal maniac"? Interesting!
50	M	Yep, that's me.
51	M	So how about it? Do I fit the bill?
52	se1	No, not at all, not at all! I lack the\nintestinal fortitude to paint your portrait!\nMy heart would simply give out!
53	N	Hah hah hah! You want this fine\nspecimen of a man to model? I warn\nye, I don't come cheap, laddie!
54	se1	Hmm, something about\nyou is reminiscent of K...
55	se1	Only a short while ago I'd have been\nelated to immortalize you on canvas, but\nI have something of a different vision now.
56	N	Well, that is a shame. Here I thought\nI'd give K a right run for his money...
57	se1	How unexpected... I don't think I've\never seen a Levnis like this before.\nIs it a special model?
58	P	Hypothesis confirmed.
59	se1	What's this? A voice within the\nmachine, hollow and yet charming...
60	se1	...Aha! The difference between form and\ncontent! I had never considered this...!
61	se1	How inspiring! Hmm, but how\nwould you depict it in a portrait...?
62	se1	What an unusual outfit! One can infer\nfrom this fashion a strong sense of\nhaughtiness...
63	se1	But it is a little too coarse for\nmy purposes. Not fitting of my\nvision at all. You may leave.
64	Q	Oh, I'll leave after I get in\none good punch on you, pal!
65	6	Ghondor, no!
66	se1	Strange... There are those who call my\nbehavior suspicious, but this person\nis extremely suspicious. With bells on.
67	se1	But there's more to it... I sense complexity\nbeyond the experiences that can be\namassed in a mere ten years...
68	R	Good eye. I'll say no more than that.
69	se1	I consider this mysterious quality to be of\nvalue, but alas, it doesn't match my vision.
70		
71	se1	Would you be able to bring\na new potential portrait subject?
72	se1	And I must meet my subjects in person,\nso please bring your finds here!
evt/nq/msg_nq240405f.json
0	se1	Oh! Yes...!
1	se1	The ephemeral appearance, belied\nby the strength contained within,\na core of steel gleaming in the eyes!
2	se1	Yes, you are the perfect model to bring\nmy vision for this new portrait to life!
3	O	...Who, me?!
4	se1	Please, this way! I must\nbegin my great work!
5	se1	Hmm, your expression's a little stiff.
6	O	O-oh, it is? It's just that I've never\ndone something like this before...
7	O	I feel so exposed...
8	5	You can do it, Fiona!
9	O	I'm doing my best!\nCan't you paint Lan-Lan too?
10	se1	Ah yes, now that's the\nexpression I'm after!
11	se1	Can you all talk to her about\nhappy things to calm her nerves?
12	1	Makes sense. How are\nyou holding up, Fiona?
13	5	Is there anything you want? Snacks?
14	O	I, um, don't think I can\nhold this pose forever...
15	se1	Well, somehow you shall have to manage.\nJust a little more painting to be done!
16	O	How much is a little more?
17	se1	Hmm, I'd say around 23 hours.
18	5	23?!
19	O	But that's so long!\nI can't stay awake that long!
20	4	That's your concern?
21	6	If you fall asleep halfway through,\nwe'll just wake you right back up again!
22	O	You've always got my back, Sennie!
23	se1	Yes! Perfect! Keep that thought!\nI'm going to need you all to keep\ntalking for the next 23 hours!
24	3	Come on, your painting's lovely,\nwrap it up already!

0	ye1	Excuse me!
1	ye1	Am I right in thinking\nyou're the Ouroboros?
2	5	Sorry, who are you again?
3	ye1	Oh, I do beg your pardon!\nI'm the Castle inspector, Ulrich.
4	ye1	I've been looking everywhere for you.
5	3	Wait a sec. Have I seen you\nsomewhere before?
6	8	Maybe Riku still half-asleep,\nbut Riku certain he seen you\ninspecting in Colony 9.
7	1	Is that so?
8	4	Do you not remember the faces\nof your own army's officers?
9	1	I...suppose not...
10	ye1	Oh, don't worry about it.
11	1	You said you'd been looking for us?
12	ye1	Yes... I actually had a favor to ask you.
13	6	Oh yeah?
14	1	Inspect the colonies that aren't\nbound by Flame Clocks...?
15	ye1	Yes. I just want to check in on how the\ncolonies without Flame Clocks are coping.
16	ye1	Just to see if the soldiers are adapting\nto life without a Flame Clock and Consul.
17	5	That's great, but what\ndo you need us for?
18	5	Surely officer rank comes\nwith an elite bodyguard or two.
19	ye1	Ah, no, I was hoping you could\nfill rather a different role.
20	ye1	Now that so many colonies have been\nliberated, our old methods of observation\naren't quite as effective.
21	ye1	You see how we can't just stroll into an\nAgnian colony and casually observe, yes?
22	ye1	But if the Ouroboros show up, then\nyou'll be warmly welcomed, I'm sure.
23	3	I guess...
24	ye1	So, what do you say? Would you help the\nCastle? And not only that, but support the\npeople living in the colonies?
25	1	...OK.
26	1	I believe you about supporting the people.
27	1	Everyone else OK with it?
28	1	Then we'll do it.
29	ye1	I'm so grateful!
30	4	Which colonies are we to survey?
31	4	I assume random choice\nwon't be very effective.
32	1	Right... I was thinking we\ncould start with Colony 9.
33	ye1	Oh?
34	1	It's somewhere Ulrich's been to inspect\nbefore, and it might be the colony that felt\nthe effects of its liberation the hardest...
35	1	What do you think, Ulrich?
36	ye1	No objections here.
37	1	We'll go and talk to Kite once\nwe've got everything ready.
evt/nq/msg_nq240501f.json
0	1	Hey, Kite.
1	cX1	What's up? If you're here\nabout the fields-
2	ye1	Fields?
3	ye1	Are you saying this colony grows its\nfood supplies rather than processing\nthem in a plant?
4	cX1	Who's this?
5	cX1	Oh, the Castle inspector's back again?!
6	8	It look like Kite remember him.
7	5	Shut up.
8	cX1	Well? What do you want?
9	1	Sorry for dropping in unannounced.\nThe thing is...
10	1	...And that's about the long and short of it.\nSo, could you tell us about how Colony 9\nhas been doing, with the fields and all?
11	cX1	Yeah, why not?
12	ye1	Oh, you don't need to go that far.\nIf I could just take a look at the\nfields, that would be fine.
13	cX1	To find the fields, go out, down the slope\ntowards the back entrance, then straight,\ncross the bridge, and they're on your left.
14	ye1	Thank you.
15	ye1	Well, I'll be off then.
16	5	Hey, don't just-!
17	1	Sorry, we'll talk again soon!
18	cX1	Y-yeah, OK...
evt/nq/msg_nq240502f.json

1	5	You can't just go running off\non your own, mate.
2	ye1	Sorry about that. It's just I was so\nthrilled at the prospect of seeing it.
3	ye1	And they did it all without\nCastle support! Impressive!
4	ye1	Really stellar work.
5	ye1	Did you push for this initiative?
6	1	Actually, no. We helped a bit,\nbut it was all the colony's doing.
7	ye1	I see. Well, how marvelous.
8	6	One of the Agnus commanders\nhelped out with it a lot.
9	ye1	What?!
10	ye1	Agnus and Keves, working together?!
11	ye1	...
12	ye1	Would you mind if we visited\nan Agnian colony next?
13	2	Are you sure?
14	ye1	I am. I believe there was one\nsomewhere in the vicinity, no?
15	2	The nearest is...hmm. Colony Gamma.
16	ye1	Then can we go there next?
17	ye1	We're in such close proximity,\nand yet it's so lightly guarded...
18	ye1	In normal times, it wouldn't be uncommon\nto see some kind of military action here.
19	ye1	But those normal times are\nno longer normal. I want to see\nhow the world is now.
20	4	...In that case, we Agnians\nwill show you around.
21	6	For some of us, it used to be home.
22	ye1	Then let's set off.
evt/nq/msg_nq240503f.json
0	ye1	So this is Colony Gamma, is it?\nI never thought the day would come\nI'd set foot in an Agnian colony.
1	ye1	There are an awful lot\nof new soldiers here.
2	4	Yes, they're kept from the front lines,\nto serve as a reserve force.
3	4	Does that interest you?
4	ye1	Of course it does!
5	ye1	Plenty of soldiers are terrified in the face\nof the uncertain future the breaking of the\nFlame Clock has given rise to.
6	ye1	They're incentivized to train harder,\nto actively, positively work to survive\nin this new, harsh world.
7	ye1	This is part of the change\nyou have brought about.
8	4	They'd probably be proud to hear\nyou assessing them in such a way.
9	ye1	I think I've seen enough. Can I ask\nyou to take me to the next place?
10	3	Yeah, yeah, where to this time?
11	ye1	The City.
12	3	Yeah, OK, City it is.
13	3	Wait, the CITY?!
14	ye1	Yes, the City. A place on Aionios which\nis unaffiliated with either Keves or Agnus.
15	ye1	My heart leapt when I heard\nthat such a place existed.
16	4	It may prove challenging to bring an\noutsider with no connections into the\nCity, though.
17	2	Hmm, yes. Is there somewhere\nelse where City folk live?
18	6	...Oh, there is! Agnus Castle!
19	3	Oh yeah, I forgot about that one.\nYou're on the ball today, Sena!
20	1	Yeah, it'll be easier to get him\nin there than the City, at least.
21	5	If Aggy and Oggy are around,\nthey'll hear us out, at least.
22	1	Would that be OK, Ulrich? It's\nnot quite what you hoped for, but...
23	ye1	Of course, it's fine.
24	ye1	My interest lies in the people,\nnot the places.
25	1	Then let's get to Agnus Castle.
evt/nq/msg_nq240504f.json
0	1	How are you doing, Oggy?
1	kW1	If it isn't Noah!\nWe're doing just dandy.
2	kW1	Hey, Aggy, look who it is!
3	jW1	Ho-ho! You're all looking well!
4	6	So are you, Aggy!
5	ye1	Ahhh, these are the City people\nwho reside in the Castle, yes?
6	jW1	Mm? Who's this?\nFriend of yours?
7	1	Yeah, so what's happening is...
8	jW1	Interesting. So, you want to\nlearn about the City, eh?
9	ye1	I do! As people with firsthand\nexperience and knowledge, would you\nmind telling me a bit about life there?
10	kW1	I see no reason why not. If Noah\nhere vouches for you, who are we\nto decline?
11	jW1	OK, shoot! Ask us anything!
12	ye1	Thank you so much, from\nthe bottom of my heart!
13	ye1	Please, this will just take a moment...
14	3	Knock yourselves out.\nWe'll find something to do.
15	ye1	Thank you so much!\nThen I'll see you later!
16	6	Are they done yet?
17	5	Oh, looks like it!
18	1	Well? Did you learn anything\ngood from them?
19	ye1	Yes, they had a lot of very interesting\nthings to say. However...
20	3	Go on.
21	ye1	Well... It was so interesting that\nI don't think I'll ever have enough\ntime to explore it all...
22	ye1	I think I'm going to stay here for a while.
23	3	What, like...live here? Are you serious?
24	ye1	Yes. Aggy and Oggy, as well as\nSeeker, the representative for Agnus,\nhave welcomed me quite warmly.
25	2	Why something so drastic?
26	ye1	I thought I'd use my position as inspector\nto benefit the Castle and Keves itself.
27	ye1	I had thought it necessary to completely\nannihilate the opposing force.
28	4	...
29	ye1	But...that sounds foolish in the present\nin which we now find ourselves.
30	ye1	Why did we only concern ourselves with\nprosperity that was built on the backs of\nso much sacrifice?
31	1	Why indeed...
32	ye1	I feel like you've opened my eyes.
33	ye1	Keves, Agnus, the City...
34	ye1	I've seen them working together,\nand now I know the shape of the\nfuture we must create.
35	ye1	Living with these people and truly\ngetting to know them... That would\nbe the first step towards this goal.
36	1	...I see. Then I guess\nour work here is done.
37	ye1	I'd like to thank you for accompanying\nme on this journey.
38	ye1	I hope this path leads to\nfar greater understanding.
39	ye1	For the future of Keves...\nno, all of Aionios.
evt/nq/msg_nq240600s.json
0	1	What are your thoughts on\nthis ether mine that Heath and\nWynonna mentioned?
1	5	The one that would kick off\nthe war with Agnus again?
2	5	Wasn't Wynonna looking into it?\nI figured she had stuff under control.
3	4	I don't doubt that someone\nof her caliber knows what\nshe's up against. Still...
4	2	What's weighing on you?
5	4	We may be on good terms with her,\nbut she seemed very happy to divulge\nclassified information like it was nothing.
6	6	There was that stuff about being blocked\nby another chain of command.
7	6	You think maybe she was trying to\nhint that she needs some backup?
8	5	But the Guard report directly\nto the Queen. Who else could\nbe pulling the strings?
9	1	Well, we know her investigation's\ncome to a standstill.
10	1	I bet the power structures in the\nCastle are part of the reason why.
11	1	That'll be why she could only talk\nabout it in such a roundabout way.\nShe couldn't openly ask for our help.
12	4	...This is all still guesswork,\nbut it does make sense.
13	3	Why's everything have to be\nso cloak and dagger? Just ask,\nfor crying out loud.
14	5	I think it's time we paid 'em a house call.\nDetective Lanz is on the case!
15	6	Yeah... We don't want to restart the\nwar with Agnus, even by accident!
16	5	...Question. Where's\nthis ether mine again?
17	4	I can't believe I have to work with you...
18	4	The ether mine is near the freight entrance\nwhere we entered Keves Castle.
19	1	Then that's where we're heading,\njust as soon as we're ready.
evt/nq/msg_nq240601t.json
0	1	Sorry to just appear out of the blue\nlike this, but would you happen to\nbe in charge of this mine?
1	@e1	Yeah, I'm the superintendent.
2	1	So you're still operating even now\nthe Flame Clock's broken?
3	@e1	Right. The Castle couldn't exactly stop\nproviding the colonies with ether cylinders.
4	@e1	We've been scraping together every drop\nof energy we could find. Working flat out,\nwe are. Hahaha...
5	1	Changing the subject a bit, but have you\nheard any of these rumors that this mine's\npreparing for war with Agnus?
6	@e1	Hah! That's a good one!
7	@e1	We're way too busy for war with Agnus!
8	1	I see... It was the Guard who were saying\nit, though. Seemed like pretty solid info.
9	@e1	The Guard? You're serious?
10	@e1	Er, well that's something...
11	1	Just to make sure, do you mind\nif we take a look around the mine?
12	@e1	Y-yeah, go ahead. Look around\nas much as you want.
13	@e1	Don't expect you'll find anything, though...
14	1	...
15	@e1	Look around to your heart's content, mate.
16	@e1	Don't expect you'll find anything, though...
evt/nq/msg_nq240602t.json
0	3	Hold up. They've got shiny new\nether cylinders jammed in here!
1	4	Intriguing. Why put it somewhere like this?
evt/nq/msg_nq240603s.json
0	5	There's something real shady\nabout that Gustav bloke.
1	1	Heath from the Guard said he wouldn't\ngo against Castle orders, though...
2	4	Even so, it's hard to imagine\na mine supervisor losing track\nof so much ether.
3	tV	He very scatterbrain person then!
4	5	You're the scatterbrain!
5	2	So if we're not mistaken, he's\nturning a blind eye to all of it?
6	1	...Or maybe he really intends\nto restart the war with Agnus.
7	1	It's not all that far-fetched,\ngiven the current climate.
8	5	Either way, we should report back to\nhim about what we've found, yeah?
9	5	If he's playing dumb, we might\neven get him to spill the beans.
10	1	...Yeah. Let's talk to Gustav again.
evt/nq/msg_nq240604f.json
0	@e1	There you are.
1	@e1	So, did you find anything?
2	1	Hmm, nothing that\nparticularly stood out.
3	1	But we did find that the number of ether\ncylinders didn't equal what was earmarked\nfor the Castle. They were in another place.
4	1	Would you know anything about that?
5	@e1	Wh-what? That sounds...
6	3	Out with it. You've been skimming\nthem off, haven't you?
7	@e1	Excuse me?!
8	@e1	Ha...hahaha! Not at all!
9	@e1	But the numbers discrepancy\nis definitely a problem!
10	@e1	I'll, er, look into it forthwith!\nI promise to get to the bottom\nof it in double-quick time!
11	@e1	I will waste no time in bringing it to\nthe attention of the inspector-in-charge\nat once!
12	6	...There he goes.
13	4	...It'll be hard to bring him to justice\nwithout conclusive evidence.
14	1	Yeah... But it's not like we\ndidn't achieve something.
15	6	He mentioned an "inspector".
16	5	Maybe that's the boss of this operation?\nThe one trying to fan the flames?
17	4	More speculation. We lack the evidence\nto come to such a conclusion.
18	1	If they make a move, it should\nmean changes for Fort O'Virbus.
19	1	Let's keep an eye out for\nanything out of the ordinary.
20	3	Yeah. And next time let's\ncatch 'em in the act!
21	1	Right. We won't let them\nget away with this.
evt/nq/msg_nq240691t.json
0	we1	I've heard some pretty weird things\nabout an ether mine near the Castle.
1	we1	They're saying one of the soldiers is\nskimming off resources to reignite the\nwar with Agnus.
2	we1	I don't think there's a lick\nof truth in it, personally.
3	we1	I know the guy in charge over there,\nGustav. We trained together, back in\nthe day.
4	we1	He's the most strait-laced fellow\nyou ever met. I can't imagine him\never going against Castle orders.
5	we1	I know the guy in charge of the\nether mine, Gustav. We trained\ntogether, back in the day.
6	we1	He's the most strait-laced fellow\nyou ever met. I can't imagine him\never going against Castle orders.
evt/nq/msg_nq240692t.json
0	xe1	Well, look at you, all together.
1	xe1	I was just on my way to get in some\nextra training with Khatorl Squad.\nYou know, for our rematch.
2	xe1	Or at least, that's what I wish I\ncould tell you. I've actually been\ngiven a new mission.
3	xe1	I'm currently chasing up rumors of\nunderground dissent against the Castle.
4	xe1	We know there's some kind of shady\nbusiness going down in one of our\nether mines, but not the specifics.
5	xe1	It seems there's a chain of command\noutside of the Guard regiment hindering\nthe investigation.
6	xe1	Goodness, sorry. I'm sure you\ndon't want to hear about all that.
7	xe1	Just pretend you didn't hear it.\nI wouldn't look into it too deeply.
8	xe1	...Though, you're free to do\nas you wish, of course.
9	1	...
10	xe1	Enemies come in all shapes and sizes.\nBeware of any strange gossip you hear.
evt/nq/msg_nq240693t.json
0	uo1	They're changing the delivery location\nfor the cylinders? Why do these requests\nkeep coming out of the blue...?
evt/nq/msg_nq240694t.json
0	vo1	Ugh, the manifest doesn't match\nthe delivery numbers, again?!
evt/nq/msg_nq240700s.json
0	5	That Gustav chappie... He's guilty as they\ncome, whichever way you slice it.
1	4	Yeah. He was still feigning innocence,\nbut those dubious ether cylinders speak\nvolumes...
2	4	Furthermore, if we take into account the\nnew information we acquired from the\nfort... I don't think we're wrong.
3	3	Speaking of juicy details, what about the\nguy who saw the Castle inspector? On the\npath under the fort in the dead of night?
4	5	Wait, what? This thing keeps getting\nshadier and shadier!
5	1	There can't be much underground\nbesides the storehouse, right?
6	4	Something certainly\nsmells distinctly piscine.
7	1	Well, those are about all the clues we\nhave. Shall we go and snoop around\nthe basement storehouse?
evt/nq/msg_nq240701f.json
0	1	Wait, is this...?
1	gf1	Hey, who are you?!
2	@e1	What do we have here?\nWhat are you all doing here?
3	2	Gustav...!
4	4	Looks like all those missing ether\ncylinders accumulated themselves\nhere... Very interesting.
5	@e1	What, no...! You just came blundering\nin here, right as I was just about to\ninvestigate this whole affair!
6	3	Yeah, yeah, cut the crap. No\npoint playing a different tune now.
7	@e1	Heh heh heh...
8	3	What's so funny?
9	@e1	Well, if you know this much,\nthere's only one thing for it!
10	5	You filthy...!
11	@e1	We'll defeat you for Keves!\nWipe you out!
evt/nq/msg_nq240702f.json
0	5	Wow, after all that talking the talk,\nis that all the walk you can walk?
1	@e1	Grr...!
2	1	OK, now spill it. What are you planning\nto do with these ether cylinders?
3	@e1	...You really don't know? Traitors!
4	3	Uh, who're the traitors now?
5	@e1	Come off it, weren't you Ouroboros\noriginally Kevesi?
6	@e1	And aren't you palling around with\nour nemesis Agnus?
7	@e1	If that's not treachery then I guess\nyou'll have to get me a dictionary!
8	@e1	Oh yeah, and you want to know\nwhat I'm planning? Yeah?
9	@e1	Well, I'm planning to use these bad boys\nto fuel an army of Levnises and send them\nstraight to Agnus, with my regards!
10	3	What the snuff? You want to keep on\nfighting this war singlehandedly?
11	@e1	Correct! Until Agnus\nis finally crushed-
12	2	Is that really what you want?
13	@e1	...Come again?
14	2	Heath said you were very sensible.\nNot someone who wanted bloodshed.
15	@e1	What does that naive little\nfool know about justice?
16	2	I'll ask again. Is this really what you want?
17	2	What you're going to do will hurt\nthe people who believe in you too.
18	2	Is that really justice? What do\nyou want to destroy Agnus for?
19	@e1	Sh-shut up!
20	@e1	Don't underestimate the Castle inspector!\nI have friends in-
21	xe1	Stop right there! Everyone, freeze!
22	@e1	Wh-what's the Guard doing here?!
23	xe1	Gustav, in the name of the Queen,\nyou're under arrest!
24	5	Oh look, they made it.
25	xe1	Thank you for helping secure\nthat seditious element.
26	1	Really, it's fine. It was more of\na happy accident, I guess.
27	xe1	We'll return the favor one day.
28	6	So, um, case...closed?
29	5	Guess so. There's still the matter of\nreturning the ether cylinders though.
30	1	What's the matter, Taion?
31	4	...Gustav said that he wanted to provoke\nwar by means of an army of Levnises,\ndidn't he?
32	1	Y-yeah...?
33	4	He'd prepared very carefully. I assume\nhe'd calculated victory based on numbers.
34	4	Which would mean that this amount of\nether cylinders wouldn't have sufficed.
35	1	You mean this isn't all of them?
36	4	It's possible he's already transported some.\nI'm also not seeing any of the Levnises in\nquestion, which is...worrying.
37	3	So, if we don't catch this Castle inspector\ntwerp there's gonna be trouble, yeah?
38	5	But there's more than one Castle inspector.\nWe have no idea which one it is.
39	1	Yeah, it's pretty bad... And while we're\ndithering here, they're still preparing\nfor war...
40	2	Then shall we talk to a Castle\ninspector we do know?
41	1	...Ah! Ulrich!
42	3	We can definitely trust him, and he knows\neveryone.
43	1	Let's get to Agnus Castle straight away,\nbefore it's too late...!
evt/nq/msg_nq240703f.json
0	ye1	Hey, everyone! Let me thank\nyou for what you-
1	1	Sorry, Ulrich, something really urgent's\ncome up.
2	ye1	Wh-what? What could possibly have\nhappened?
3	ye1	What even...? A Castle inspector is plotting\nan invasion of Agnus...?
4	5	Please tell us it's not you.
5	ye1	Of course it's not me! If I were to do\nsomething so reckless, it would ruin my\nentire life's work!
6	2	We know you want peace with Agnus,\nso we were hoping you'd help us.
7	ye1	O-of course...
8	ye1	So...in other words, you came here to\nask me if I had any inkling as to who this\nringleader amongst the inspectors is?
9	3	You're a smart boy. So, how's about it?
10	ye1	OK, let me think... Of all the Castle\ninspectors I know, is there anyone who'd\ndo something like that...?
11	4	Is this a dead end...?
12	ye1	I'm sorry... Look, how about this? I have\nanother idea.
13	ye1	A new Castle inspector's scheduled to\ntransfer here today.
14	6	A new one?
15	ye1	That's right. She was approved for my\nAgnus reconciliation policy, and, by all\naccounts, is a brilliant inspector.
16	ye1	Why don't you talk to her?
17	1	Sure, we can do that. If that's what\nyou recommend, Ulrich.
18	ye1	She should be arriving any time now.\nThey've arranged for the floodgate to\nbe opened, so-
19	1	Wh-what was that?!
20	pk1	Explosion at the port!
21	qk1	Are we under attack? What's going on?!
22	ye1	The port?! Then...!
23	5	Hey, not so fast!
evt/nq/msg_nq240704f.json
0	2	What's this?!
1	6	Kevesi Levnises...!
2	4	No! This can't be happening!
3	1	Save the chat, we've got\nenemies to take out!
evt/nq/msg_nq240705f.json
0	ye1	Inspector Luciona! What is the\nmeaning of this?
1	ye1	You can't...you can't be the mastermind\nbehind this invasion of Agnus?!
2	ze1	...I see the Ouroboros managed to follow\ntheir noses this far. How extremely\nirritating.
3	5	Can't believe we went to all that trouble\nto find her when she just showed up here\non her own.
4	ye1	But how could such a brilliant inspector\ndo such a thing...?
5	ze1	On the contrary, Inspector Ulrich.\nYou're the one who has forgotten\nhis duty.
6	ze1	You swore an oath of fealty to the Queen,\nand instead here you are, you venomous,\nturncoat Aspar, betraying Keves!
7	ye1	I haven't betrayed anyone! Everything I've\ndone was for the sake of Keves's future!
8	ze1	Ever since I heard about your\nreconciliation plan, I knew I had to\ndestroy you with my own hands!
9	ze1	And you, Ouroboros! You're stained with\nthe sin of insurgency as well!
10	ye1	But Inspector Luciona...!
11	1	Stand back, Ulrich. We'll take it from here!
evt/nq/msg_nq240706f.json
0	5	OK, NOW the case is closed.
1	4	This case, certainly. But...
2	ye1	...I'm so sorry.
3	ye1	I was blinded to her true intentions,\nand have caused an awful lot of trouble\nfor you and the people of Agnus...
4	1	It's not your fault, Ulrich. This could have\nhappened at any time...
5	2	The grudges between Agnus and Keves\ngo deeper than any of us thought.
6	ye1	You're right, of course...\nIt's sad, but that's the truth.
7	ye1	But giving up now would be giving\nInspector Luciona what she wants.
8	ye1	It's clear, looking at you, that there is a\nnon-zero possibility of reconciliation.
9	ye1	I have to try to put this reconciliation\npolicy into action. For both Keves and\nAgnus!
10	1	And we'll do anything\nwe can to help, Ulrich!
evt/nq/msg_nq300100s.json
0	2	So, the Lost Numbers who were active\non the Erythia Sea have gone missing,\none by one...
1	6	They said they were swallowed up\nby the fog and vanished, right?
2	2	Right...
3	4	If we're looking for fog, how about\nthat thick cloud that sprang up near\nAnu Shoals?
4	5	Oh, yeah, you're right.
5	2	I wonder if that fog has\nsomething to do with the\nother one...?
6	2	That fog lifted quickly though, and nothing\nhappened, so I didn't want to say anything.
7	2	But...I got the feeling there\nwas something in the fog.
8	1	The fog we encountered could be the\nsame one, then...
9	3	Kisame's the authority on all things\nErythia Sea, yeah? Anyone fancy\na fact-finding mission to Vinisog Holm?
10	1	That's a good idea. Let's talk to her.
evt/nq/msg_nq300101t.json
0	1	Can you tell us what you know\nabout white fog on the Erythia Sea?
1	ti1	Oh, you're interested in that too?
2	ti1	Monica's already been here asking me\nto do a little digging on the topic.
3	ti1	So, nothing seems to happen\nwhen you're on a boat, but...
4	ti1	If you make landfall on an island with that\nfog laid on it, then as soon as you take\nyour eyes off your friends they vanish.
5	ti1	That fog has taken a lot of\npeople I know away from me...
6	1	I see...
7	ti1	I really want to get to the bottom of it\nbefore anyone else gets hurt.
8	1	So you don't even know whether it's\ncaused by a monster or it's some new\nmilitary technology?
9	1	Won't it be dangerous to investigate\nit alone? Let us help you.
10	ti1	Wow, the Ouroboros want to help me?\nThat would be amazing, thank you!
11	ti1	There are a lot of eyewitness reports\nsaying the white fog is near\nAnu Shoals.
12	ti1	You may be Ouroboros, but it's tough to\nmove around on a boat, don't forget! Go\ncareful out there.
evt/nq/msg_nq300102f.json
0	2	This is just like the fog\nwe saw the other time...
1	1	I have to say, I don't think there's\nanything actually in the fog.
2	2	...
3	2	No, you're right. I don't\nsense anything in there.
4	1	Let's wait until it lifts, and investigate\nsomewhere else.
evt/nq/msg_nq300103f.json
0	3	Whoa, did you see that?
1	4	I did indeed.
2	3	That shadow has to be a monster, right?
3	4	We don't have sufficient data to determine\nif that creature is responsible for the\ndisappearances though.
4	3	Well, nothing's going to happen as long\nas we're on a boat, according to Kisame.
5	4	Correct. We should find a suitable place\nto make landfall and search for the fog\non land.
6	4	Now according to my calculations as to\nwhere we'll find the fog...
7	4	What do you say to heading in the\ndirection of Anu Shoals?
8	3	Aye aye, set a course for the fog monster!

0	5	Can't see anything worth seeing.
1	4	The shadow we saw wasn't that big.\nWe don't even know what it looks like...
2	4	We should take sufficient\nprecautions-
3	4	Gah!
4	4	Did you see that?
5	6	Sure did!
6	2	There!
7	2	Huh?!
8	2	Watch yourselves, everyone!\nWe're surrounded!
9	3	I thought there was just one!
10	5	Lucky we brought enough\nfight for everyone!
evt/nq/msg_nq300105f.json
0	2	Some monsters can really sneak up\non you... Good to know...
1	1	The way they move without a sound, and\nattack without you realizing... Makes sense\nthat people use the word "disappear."
2	6	It really does.
3	3	So those things must have\nbeen making the fog.
4	5	And there can't be any more\nof them about because the fog's\nall cleared up!
5	4	This should at least help stem the damage.
6	1	Let's report our findings to Kisame.
evt/nq/msg_nq300106t.json
0	ti1	So the monsters were creating the fog,\nand attacking people. Of course...
1	ti1	And Anu Shoals, where you\nlanded and got attacked, must\nhave been their nest.
2	ti1	But now that you've taken them all out,\neverything should be fine!
3	ti1	You avenged the soldiers, and helped\nme with my investigation. Thanks so much.
evt/nq/msg_nq300107f.json
0	6	I can't believe this fog...
1	9	It so white Manana not able\nto see wing in front of face!
2	1	This looks dangerous to go through...
3	80400	Anu Shoals found close by here.
4	80400	Riku not want to force ship aground.\nIt better to wait in patience until fog clear.
5	10300	Yeah, I suppose...
6	2	Oh!
7	6	Did you see something, Mimi?
8	2	Just now, there was...
9	2	I must have imagined it...
10	1	Mio, Sena, take shifts on watch-
11	1	Whoa!
12	2	Look!
13	6	No way... The fog's clearing...
14	1	What in the world's going on...?
evt/nq/msg_nq300200s.json
0	1	So, we have these three wood pieces...
1	1	"THET", "REES", and "WOT"...
2	3	Then there's the "NEEDHELP" piece\nthat Lotus picked up.
3	6	And last of all are random-looking\nnumbers...
4	2	Hmmm, could "WOT" come before "REES"...?\n"WOTR" might mean "water", maybe?
5	5	The other two pieces don't even\nmake that much sense to me...
6	3	...Wait! What if we put spaces in-between\nsome of these pieces? Put a space near\nthe end of "THET" to get "THE"...
7	3	Then put a space in front of\nthe other "T"...then we get\n"THE TWO TREES", right?"
8	5	That sure sounds like a landmark to me!
9	1	If so, these "two trees" can't be any old\ntrees. There has to be something about\nthem that would make them a landmark.
10	6	All that's left to figure out now are\nthese numbers...
11	4	I found an island that fits that description.\nSharing it with you all now.
12	3	Go Taion!
13	5	Talk about quick!\nHow did you narrow it down?!
14	4	All I did was input those numbers into my\nIris's coordinate system... It's nothing to be\n*that* impressed by.
15	6	That little grin you've got tells\na different story.
16	3	Heh. You're not exactly great at hiding\nhow you feel, you know.
17	4	...Stop staring at my face! It's creepy!
18	3	Teasing aside, though, that was, like,\nseriously impressive! Now we can go\nhelp who sent the message.
19	1	Let's head to where the coordinates are\npointing to. We're bound to find our\n"two trees" there!
evt/nq/msg_nq300201t.json
0	vi1	...Meh-meh?! Eyes no deceive Niranira!\nOtherpon come help Niranira!
1	5	So, you must've been who wrote\nthe message on those wood pieces.
2	vi1	Yes! Was Niranira who wrote message,\nthat float on sea.
3	vi1	Must strike iron while news still hot topic!\nTo quicksand island, a-go-go!
4	5	Hold on there, furball.\nDid you say "quicksand island"?
5	vi1	Is target destination of Niranira!
6	vi1	Want go there at all cost.\nIs why Niranira sent message to sea.
7	4	So then, it wasn't a distress signal,\nafter all...
8	4	It was a call for "help" to find this island\nyou're after.
9	vi1	Was obvious from start. What else\n"NEEDHELP" on message mean?
10	5	But...why didn't you just head back\nto the continent yourself and ask\nsomeone to help?
11	vi1	Because tiny boat Niranira rode on\nbreak to itty-bitty pieces!
12	5	So you *did* get shipwrecked then!\nI'd call that "distress", furball.
13	vi1	Broken boat not cause for distress. Such\nthing only natural part of journey! Niranira\nheed call of romance!
14	4	...I can't say I'm convinced by your\nreasoning, Niranira.
15	4	Therefore, we'll accompany you to the\nisland, considering you've got no way\nof returning home, anyway.
16	vi1	Many thanks to friends!\nNow here come Niranira, quicksand island!
evt/nq/msg_nq300202f.json
0	vi1	This quicksand...!\nNo doubt is island that Niranira after!
1	vi1	This is discovery that make feather\nof Niranira stand on end! Such thrill!
2	6	Wait, no!
3	5	What if you get caught in-?!
4	vi1	SUCH ROMAAAAAAAANCE!!!
5	5	...Stupid furball.
6	3	He's got some legs on him, though,\nI'll give him that.
7	6	Doesn't make it any less dangerous for\nhim to be walking around on his own.
8	1	You're right. Let's chase after him.
9	4	As much as I would love to give chase...
10	4	...it appears we're going to need\nspecialized equipment to climb\nthis hill.
11	3	Guess we'll have to come back after\nwe've got that equipment then.
evt/nq/msg_nq300203f.json
0	6	Ah, ha! There he is!
1	vi1	(huff puff) Nothing...
2	vi1	...stop Niranira in pursue... (huff puff)
3	vi1	ROMAAAAAAAANCE!!!
4	vi1	Meh-meeeeeeh...
5	4	He literally ran straight into quicksand...
6	6	W-we've gotta help him!
7	5	We're pretty much knee-deep in\nthis ourselves at this point...
evt/nq/msg_nq300204t.json
0	5	Hey, furball! What the spark were you\nthinking, running straight into quicksand?!\nYou could've been killed!
1	vi1	Meh-meh... Niranira so embarrassed...
2	vi1	But, embarrassment not stop Niranira\nlast time on island.
3	vi1	Niranira not fail next time!\nInvestigation must continue!
4	6	Investigation? What are you investigating?
5	vi1	Niranira after landmark that\nin risk of ruin completely.
6	vi1	Niranira want friends not to stop Niranira\nin honorable pursuit!
7	5	Oh, we weren't thinking of that,\nbelieve me...
8	vi1	Thank you, friends!
9	vi1	In middle of island is Ferronis!\nWe make next meeting there!
evt/nq/msg_nq300205t.json
0	4	So, this is the landmark you've been\nwanting to see?
1	vi1	Yes.
2	vi1	As friends see, we too late to see Ferronis\nbefore destroy by event of annihilation...
3	6	Is this Ferronis special to you?
4	vi1	Really, not all that extra-special.
5	vi1	Not so special, But...Niranira still\nnot want it to vanish off existence.
6	4	...I'm not sure we can do anything\nto reverse an annihilation event...
7	4	This may be the end of its material\nexistence. But it can still live on within\nyou, Niranira.
8	vi1	Niranira not understand. How can big\nFerronis be inside of little Niranira?
9	4	I don't mean the Ferronis itself, but its\nmemory. You said yourself you didn't\nwant it to vanish, right?
10	4	Then how about taking those feelings you\nhave and doing something with them?
11	vi1	...Meh-meh? Is...this what Niranira think...?
12	vi1	Is this romance?!
13	4	I don't quite know if that's the right word\nfor it...
14	vi1	Niranira understand now!\nMuch thanks, spectacle friend!
15	4	S-sure...
16	vi1	Though investigation of Niranira complete,\nthere one more thing Niranira want do.
17	vi1	And that thank friend who found signage\nof Niranira.
18	6	You mean Lotus?
19	vi1	Is that name of friend? Would love to meet!
20	6	Then let me guess...
21	vi1	Please to bring Niranira to friend!
22	4	No surprise, there...
23	6	Still, I also want to meet up with Lotus.\nWe have to thank her for helping us out,\nafter all.
24	4	...That's a good point.
25	4	We all may as well head back to\nColony Mu then.
evt/nq/msg_nq300206f.json
0	bg1	Hmm. I wonder what wrecks or\ntreasures I'll end up finding today?
1	vi1	Thanks you, friend!!!
2	bg1	Wah!!!\nYou scared the life out of me!
3	vi1	Is friend Lotus? Was told Lotus was one\nwho pick up message of Niranira.
4	vi1	Niranira want say thanks for that.
5	bg1	Y-you're welcome, I guess?
6	4	...Niranira might have jumped the\ngun there.
7	6	Sorry to scare you like that.\nYou see...
8	bg1	Oh, I get it now! So, you're the one who\nwrote that "NEEDHELP" message?
9	vi1	Is what Niranira said at start. Is thanks\nto Lotus that Niranira get help.
10	vi1	Many thanks!
11	bg1	Hehe, it's fine, really. I was a little\nexcitable myself when I first found\nthat sign.
12	bg1	But...shame about that\nannihilation event, eh?
13	bg1	It must've really derailed your\ninvestigation.
14	vi1	Oh, it not derail.
15	vi1	Viewings of ruined landmark is\nduty of Niranira.
16	5	Before I forget to ask, what's all this\nbusiness about investigations and duties?
17	vi1	You see, friend, job of Niranira is\nto make world map!
18	vi1	Only, there so many event of annihilation\nthat keep on happening...
19	vi1	And to make proper world map,\nNiranira had to travel many sites\nof annihilation event.
20	4	So, you're a cartographer, then?\nI had heard of Nopon doing surveying\nbefore...
21	2	It would explain why he's so\nfixated on finding landmarks.
22	3	But, like, doesn't all that map-making go\nto waste right after the terrain goes and\nchanges itself up?
23	vi1	Is as friend say.
24	vi1	When little piece of world fall\naway, little piece of heart of\nNiranira fall away too.
25	vi1	However, as speccy-friend taught Niranira,\nthere also things that never fall away.
26	bg1	Huh, stuff that doesn't vanish?
27	vi1	Landmark in world that still remain.
28	vi1	So, Niranira continue to record landmark!\nContinue to battle event of annihilation!
29	4	...I see your logic here. Better to carry on\nwith a positive attitude rather than bemoan\nabout amending previous landmarks.
30	vi1	Event of annihilation never erase\nromance of Niranira!
31	bg1	...I don't get what you mean by romance.\nWhat is it to you?
32	vi1	To Niranira, it sparkling feeling\nof thrills and excitement!
33	vi1	Essence of romance is...perhaps goal will\nnever be achieved... Perhaps in end, will\nhave been meaningless gesture...
34	vi1	But fur brim with thousand fiery\nsuns of passion to try anyway!\nThat is whole point of romance!
35	bg1	Wowzers...! I don't really know what\nyou're on about, but I can tell you're\nreal fired up!
36	vi1	Yes! Niranira fiery-hot all over!
37	bg1	Yeah! And when you get served a piping\nhot delicacy, you just gotta do it justice\nand scarf it down before it cools, right?
38	vi1	Lotus totally get Niranira!\nNiranira so thankful!
39	3	Uhm...I can't even tell if they're talking\nat cross-purposes or not here...
40	6	But, it looks like Lotus understands\nNiranira on the level of emotions, at least.
41	4	The feeling that you don't know if what\nyou do will suffice, whether or not you'll\nmake it...
42	4	...but you still try with the passion\nof a thousand suns, anyway...
43	2	...Taion, can you make sense of this?
44	4	I can't quite answer that at the moment.
45	4	But...I hope that someday, I can understand\nfeelings like that...and be fired up by them\nthe same way.
evt/nq/msg_nq300207t.json
0	bg1	Hey! Look at this!
1	5	...Yep, that's a bit of broken wood, all right.
2	bg1	No, really, look at it! Don't you\nfind the shape interesting?
3	bg1	If you polished it up all nice, it'd make a\ncool plate with a handle, don't you think?
4	3	That's a really cleanly broken bit of\nwood, huh! Though it speaks more\n"chopping board" than "plate" to me.
5	3	...Wait a minute. There's\nsomething written on it...
6	bg1	Huh? Where...?
7	bg1	...Oh, yeah, you're right! It reads\n"NEEDHELP"!
8	5	Where did you find this thing?
9	bg1	On the hidden coast! All kinds\nof things wash up there!
10	3	You know, if that was someone's\ndistress signal...
11	5	Maybe some other clues washed up\non the beach? Let's go have a look!
evt/nq/msg_nq300208t.json
0	1	This looks like another piece of that debris.
1	5	Hey, is this another bit maybe?
2	3	This one has the same kind of writing.\nWe'd better hold on to this.
3	2	This has something written on it.
4	6	There's something written on this!
5	4	...I spot writing. This must one of the\npieces that we're looking for.
evt/nq/msg_nq300300f.json
0	1	I wonder what this is...
1	3	That monument-looking thing?
2	4	It looks as though there's something\nwritten on it...
3	8	Friends must wait!
4	5	No need to shout...
5	9	It very dangerous to go closer!
6	8	Manana is correct!
7	9	Danger! Peril! Jeopardy!
8	2	What's dangerous about it? Not that I'm\naccusing you of overreacting.
9	8	Extremely ferocious monster\nsleeping in that place!
10	5	Ferocious, you say?
11	9	That right! Friends must never ever ever\nmake offering to monument!
12	8	Many offering will awaken monster\nfrom hideous slumber!
13	3	Oh, why would you say that?
14	5	You know we're gonna\nhave to do it now, right?
15	8	But it forbidden! Riku forbid it!
16	9	It monster of horrible terrible danger!
17	1	Well, if you insist...
18	2	If it's such a big deal, maybe we\nshouldn't get involved, after all...
19	8	That decision of wisdom.
20	5	But you're curious, right?
21	1	Well, yeah, but...
22	9	Friends wake dangerful beast at own risk!\nManana wash wings of matter!
23	3	Well, let's think about what we should\ndo later at our own risk, shall we?
evt/nq/msg_nq300301t.json
0	1	This is where it goes, I think.
1	2	How dangerous can it be...?
2	5	Let's see what comes out...
3	6	Riku and Manana are gonna be so mad...
4	3	Time to worship at the altar of the beast!
5	4	I just want to find out what'll happen.\nFor science.
evt/nq/msg_nq300302f.json
0	8	Friends did it... Everyone is big stupid...
1	9	We try to stop you, but you not listen...
2	3	What the spark is that?!
3	5	Whoa, what is it?!
4	1	What...?
5	6	Oh no, it's cute!
6	8	Sena?!
7	2	It...it really is kind of cute...
8	9	How could Mio?!
9	1	I'm struggling to see a\n"deadly monster" here...
10	6	CAN I PET IT?!
11	6	AHHHH!
12	5	It's gone berserk!
13	3	Sena, look what you did!
14	6	How is this my fault?!
15	2	OK, this isn't funny!
16	4	This is no time for foolishness!\nThat beastie means business!
17	1	Time to fight!
evt/nq/msg_nq300303f.json
0	5	(pant pant) OK, yeah, I believe\nyou about the rampaging now.
1	6	Yeah, it was definitely dangerous...
2	4	They were indeed correct when they\nsaid that curiosity killed the Ferox.
3	2	We're sorry for not listening to you,\nRiku, Manana. You did warn us.
4	8	No... Friends get hold of\nwrong end of sausage.
5	1	What?
6	9	Correct... Danger is in cuteness!
7	2	Sorry?
8	9	How could friends call such creature cute\nwhen friends have adorable Nopon\ncompanions right here?!
9	9	Manana not angry, Manana disappointed\nthat friends wake up that monster and\ndistracted by cuteness.
10	6	Wh...what the...?
11	8	Riku not able to believe how friends cast\naside endearing Nopon friends to fall wings\nover heels for that monster.
12	8	It disheartening in extreme.
13	3	Wait, wait, so you're saying...
14	3	You're jealous of how cute\nthat monster was?
15	8	Riku not know jealousness.
16	9	Yes! This hard battle for reason\nof being of all Noponkind!
17	8	Exactly right! Nopon not\nable to be out-cuted.
18	1	Oh, er, right... Well, you know, you're our\nfriends, so...
19	2	R-right, we weren't trying to slight you.
20	8	If friends speaking honesty, then\nRiku ask that friends please be\nmore careful next time.
21	9	Next time Manana get truly angry! If\nfriends do again, then friends not expect\nto eat Tasty Sausage anytime soon!
22	6	We're really so sorry...
23	4	I don't think this is something\nwe need to apologize for...
evt/nq/msg_nq300401f.json

1	4	The Nopon said any color\nwas fine, as I recall.
2	1	Hmm, in that case...
3		Take the red stone
4	1	Let's take the red stone.
5		Take the blue stone
6	1	Blue stone OK with everyone?
7		Take the yellow stone
8	1	May as well go for the yellow stone.
9		Take all of them
10	1	I can't decide. Let's just take them all.
11		Which stone do you want to take?

4	dk1	It not about favorite color.\nPlease give stone to Shillshill.
5	1	Will do.
6	dk1	And thank you much!
7	dk1	You bring all stone?!
8	1	Yeah, we couldn't decide\nwhich one was best.
9	dk1	Let see... In that case,\nplease take blue stone.
10	1	OK.
11	dk1	And give warm regards of\nRuggyscruggy to Shillshill!
evt/nq/msg_nq310100s.json
0	6	The City's full of things I've never heard\nof, and all this amazing tech and stuff.
1	6	But they seem to have to scavenge\nthings like Levnis parts, like we do.
2	3	It'll be a sight harder than just\nnormal scavenging, too.
3	3	Outwitting both Agnus and Keves\nto get the stuff they need? Not my\nidea of fun.
4	3	And they can't leave any\ntrace behind either.
5	4	That's why they have a\nspecialized scavenging force.
6	4	They're elite, but in a different\nway to Monica's corps, which\nfight on the front line.
7	4	I assume there can't be many of them,\nso the force can stay flexible and mobile.
8	3	What, like a little secret platoon?
9	2	Hey, could we pay a visit to\nN'ohm Wetlands ourselves?
10	2	I would like to know more\nabout these Lost Numbers...
11	1	You're curious about the scavengers?
12	2	A little. It seems like a lot of hard work.
13	5	We could lend 'em a hand. They're\nprobably pretty shorthanded over there.
14	5	Least, Eunie made it sound like\nthey're a titchy little unit.
15	3	Oh, so it's my fault, is it?
16	1	Well regardless, it'd be a good\nopportunity to get to know them better.
17	1	To N'ohm Wetlands it is.
evt/nq/msg_nq310101t.json
0	rk1	You...!
1	1	Don't worry. We're on your side.
2	2	We're friends of Monica. We thought\nyou might be able to use a hand.
3	rk1	Monica...? Then you must be Ouroboros!
4	rk1	Fantastic! We're fine here, but the\ncaptain up ahead could use some help.
5	rk1	You...!
6	1	Don't worry. We're...
7	rk1	Ouroboros, right? You brought\nback everyone's belongings.
8	rk1	I was at the Remembrance Stones then.
9	2	So then, the person you were mourning...
10	rk1	You brought his memory home.\nI'll always be grateful to you for that.
11	rk1	I'm going to have to rely on your\nhelp a little more. Could you give\nthe captain up ahead a hand?
12	rk1	Seems like monsters are really\nslowing down the retrieval.
13	1	Understood. We'll do what we can.
14	2	Are you all fine, then?
15	rk1	Yeah, not to worry, we're five by five.\nWe'll be taking every last bit of plunder\nback to the City.
16	rk1	This wreckage? It's like a treasure trove\nfor us. Can't be wasting a single bit...
17	rk1	...
18	2	...Are you OK? Is something wrong?
19	rk1	A friend of mine died recently.\nHis name was Yew...
20	rk1	Oh, it's just... You remember the\nkeepsakes you brought back?\nI had a friend...Yew.
21	rk1	I see that wreckage, and I just can't help\nbut think about the folks who died there...
22	rk1	We should be grateful for\neverything left there.
23	1	That's a feeling I understand well.
24	rk1	We're fine here, but the captain\nup ahead could use some help.
25	rk1	Seems like monsters are really\nslowing down the retrieval.

1	sk1	Mizuki told me you were coming!
2	5	Oof, that's a voice and a half...
3	sk1	Gahahaha! How rude of me!\nRest assured that we will leave\nno trace of our existence!
4	2	Well, I'm glad you're so enthusiastic...\nIt's taking you some time to retrieve\neverything, I hear?
5	sk1	Mmm! Had a bit of trouble with\nGaraffas, you see!
6	sk1	I don't know what's got them in such\na tizz. They just won't seem to leave\nour salvage alone!
7	sk1	It's proving nigh impossible to get our\nhands on those Levnis parts. I'd like to\nretrieve them undamaged if possible...
8	5	So you just need us to bash up some\nGaraffas? Piece of cake.
9	sk1	Recovery of resources is the goal!\nEngaging the enemy is secondary\nto that! Repeat!
10	5	Gah! Where did that come from?!
11	sk1	That's the order of priority!\nDon't you forget it!
12	sk1	We support more lives with\nour scavenging than you know!

1	sk1	And no significant damage to note...\nNothing to sneeze at, eh?
2	sk1	That's Ouroboros for you, I suppose...
3	2	So we finally convinced her.
4	4	This was a test from\nthe get-go, wasn't it?
5	4	I suppose you wanted to know if the power\nof the famous Ouroboros would mesh with\nthe Lost Numbers' way of life.
6	sk1	So, you saw through us. You're\nsmarter than I thought you'd be.
7	2	It's good to know how the scavenger\ntroops feel about us, anyway.
8	2	Thank you for telling us.
9	sk1	I'm the one who should be thanking you.\nThanks to you, I got to keep my team safe.
10	sk1	Mizuki's a newlywed, you know,\nand I couldn't face Mei if anything\nhappened to him.
11	sk1	...But I digress. Better get\nthe troops home safely, eh?
12	sk1	Thanks for your help! Pleasure\nworking with you, Ouroboros!
evt/nq/msg_nq310105t.json
0	1	We'll just pick this up, then...
1	5	Well, I don't see any scratches.\nSparks, that was stressful...
2	3	Perfect, done.
3	2	Everything looks intact, so that's good.
4	4	Recovery complete.
5	6	Let me just get this...
evt/nq/msg_nq310200f.json
0	zk1	Gigi asking big ask here!\nFriends in?
1	xk1	Of course! Shiner, you in?
2	wk1	I...guess...? Maybe we could\ntry asking someone?
3	2	Can we help you?
4	wk1	Oh, I didn't see you there!
5	wk1	O-Ouroboros!
6	xk1	What do you guys say to a treasure hunt?\n'Cause we're about to go on one!
7	2	What, now?
8	wk1	Yeah, right now!\nBut I warn you...it's pretty hard.
9	wk1	We were just looking for\nmore people to join in, too.
10	zk1	But this special treasure hunt!\nOnly kids can play.
11	wk1	Why does that matter? Who cares\nas long as we're all having fun?
12	xk1	Right? Don't be such a\nstick-in-the-mud!
13	xk1	Anyway, you made it, and you're\na grown-up, aren't you? So it's fine!
14	zk1	Gigi is cut to quick...
15	5	Well...if you need us\nthat much, we'll help...
16	wk1	We do! It'll be so embarrassing\nif we can't solve the clues!
17	xk1	And there are so many!\nPleeease!
18	5	Fine, you've twisted our arms...
19	2	We'll help a little bit, OK?
20	wk1	Yay!
21	xk1	Thank you!
22	zk1	...Very well. Gigi explain rules.
23	zk1	These clue lead to three boxes,\nwhich all are in the City.
24	zk1	Each person follow one clue,\nand bring box back here, OK?
25	1	What exactly are these boxes?
26	zk1	Appearance and form is different each\nfrom other. Everything else is trade secret!
27	xk1	But they're all marked with an X!
28	2	It's good that you've marked them.
29	zk1	Team of Ouroboros get this clue.
30	zk1	"At foot of 15 lights"!
31	5	Eh? What's that meant to be?
32	wk1	It's a clue, duh?!\nI don't get it at all, though.
33	3	Ugh, what a faff. OK, so,\nwhat does "foot" mean?
34	3	Is the box at the bottom of something?
35	4	And then there's this "15 lights" business.
36	4	So what we're looking for is a lot of light\nsources. And theoretically, if we search at\nthe bottom of it, we should find something.
37	wk1	I wonder what it'll be...
38	zk1	You save those brain for own clues!
39	zk1	It take some time, so get solving!
40	xk1	Solving now!
41	wk1	OK! I'm definitely gonna find it!
42	xk1	Yeah!
43	3	We'd better get searching\nfor ours too, I guess.
44	1	Yeah, let's try to find some\nlights that fit the bill.
evt/nq/msg_nq310201f.json
0	6	Hey, do you think this is the box?
1	6	It has an X on it and everything!
2	3	"At the foot of 15 lights..."
3	3	So, at the bottom of where\nthere are 15 lights?
4	6	We solved it!
5	3	Looks like it.
6	3	Let's go back to Ribelly Plaza, then.
evt/nq/msg_nq310202t.json
0	1	I can't see a mark on it... I don't think\nthis is the box we're looking for.
1	5	Ugh, nothing marked on this one.\nWhere's the real box?!
2	3	Can't see an X on it.\nNot our treasure box, I guess...
3	2	There's no X marked on it. This\ndoesn't seem to be the right one.
4	6	Boo, no X on this one at all!\nThe real box has to be somewhere\nthough...
5	4	No... I can't have made\na mistake... And yet...!
evt/nq/msg_nq310203t.json
0	1	...The number of lights doesn't\nmatch what we're looking for.\nI don't think this is it.
1	5	Hmm, no matter how you count 'em,\nthe number of lights doesn't match\nthe clue.
2	3	That doesn't look like 15 lights to me.\nTime to search someplace else.
3	2	That isn't the right number of lights.\nBetter to keep searching elsewhere.
4	6	Here are some lights!\nBut not 15 of them...
5	4	...Wrong number of lights.\nWe need 15 exactly.
evt/nq/msg_nq310204f.json
0	zk1	All boxes are found! Everyone\nwork very hard, well done!
1	xk1	Heh, we rock.
2	wk1	I must have run around half the City!
3	6	So what happens to the boxes now?
4	zk1	Now is...
5	zk1	Open boxes and enjoy contents!
6	xk1	Yay! Open the boxes! Open the boxes!
7		Each box was opened...
8	wk1	Hang on. There's notes in here...
9	xk1	Let me see!
10	wk1	"28756"...
11	wk1	"Memory house"...
12	wk1	"Capped"...
13	wk1	...That's all of them.
14	xk1	So then...this is *another* clue!
15	5	This one's even harder to get\nthan the last one...
16	3	That's why we had to find all of\nthem, innit? Put them together\nand they mean something.
17	3	Look. Join them up like this...
18	2	"Capped memory house"...?\nLike, snow-capped? But what\nwould this "memory house" be?
19	wk1	Could be the Memorial Hall.\nBut what's above there? A road?
20	xk1	...Wait! I know!
21	xk1	It's the Caelum Residential Quarter!\nIt has to be! And I heard they've got\nspare places to stay up there!
22	wk1	Whaaat?! San, you're so clever!\nThat must be it!
23	5	Right, so what's this\n"28756" number then...?
24	5	Some kinda coordinates to this\nresidential quarter or something...?
25	wk1	It could be the flat number!
26	xk1	Nah, I don't think there\nare that many flats...
27	4	What if we move it\naround in the message?
28	zk1	It probably not that complicated...
29	4	..."Probably"?
30	4	I thought you were the one\nwho designed these clues.
31	zk1	M-meh...
32	2	But then who did...?
33	zk1	Gi...Gigi not at liberty to...
34	wk1	I've got it! It's a key code!
35	wk1	I bet the flat's got a door where you\nhave to punch in a number to open it!
36	xk1	That has to be it! Shiner,\nhow are you so amaziiing?!
37	wk1	Heh heh!
38	4	In that case, it looks like we've somehow\nstumbled across our second answer.
39	zk1	Gigi already say, these\nvery special clues!
40	zk1	Gigi unable to solve by self...
41	zk1	But Gigi know you capable of solve!
42	xk1	Of course we can!\nLet's see if we were right!
43	wk1	To the flats on top of the\nMemorial Hall! Shiner, away!
44	4	...
45	3	Well, I've got no sparkin' idea\nwho set this all up...
46	3	Let's keep playing along for now.\nGigi's clearly at a loss without us.
47	4	...Oh, if we must.
48	4	I'm not one to leave a\nmystery unresolved.
evt/nq/msg_nq310205f.json
0	xk1	Would you look at that,\nit really worked!
1	wk1	But there's nothing here...
2	2	I don't think that's quite right.
3	2	There's a note.
4	2	"Return to the Founder, bringing tribute."
5	zk1	Meh!
6	xk1	It's the next clue!
7	5	How many of these are there...?!
8	zk1	Gigi think this last one.
9	6	How can you be sure?
10	zk1	Because Gigi know\nanswer of clue.
11	wk1	I think I know it too! "Founder" must mean\nlike, the statues of the Founders, right?
12	zk1	That not correct. "Founder"\nmean "person who start thing".
13	zk1	So it "person who make clues"...
14	zk1	It point to friend of Gigi.
15	6	But what about this tribute thing?
16	zk1	That easy! It thing that is\nfavorite of founder.
17	zk1	And founder like...Torpedo wrap!
18	wk1	Boo, this is just grocery shopping!
19	zk1	It not at all.
20	zk1	Real question behind this is difficult\nquestion that Gigi not able to answer.
21	zk1	Gigi need help of everyone\nto solve last clue.
22	xk1	We can do it! We still\nwanna get the treasure!
23	wk1	Yeah, we'll do it easy-peasy!
24	3	Well we ain't gonna leave you high and\ndry after coming this far, are we?
25	zk1	...Gigi very grateful.
26	zk1	First we need Torpedo wrap from\nbest Torpedo wrapsmith Gigi know.
evt/nq/msg_nq310206f.json
0	5	This should be fine, right?
1	zk1	Incorrect.
2	zk1	One extra-sweet Plumage Honey\nTorpedo wrap, please!
3	zm1	There you go, thank you!
4	5	I didn't even know they\ndid them like this!
5	zk1	This only available on specials\nmenu. It very sweet and tasty.
6	zk1	But one you just bought also tasty.\nGigi would like you to savor!
7	3	You coulda told us that earlier!
8	4	To miss out on the toppings\nis a grievous blow indeed.
9	3	Aaand he's still on about the food.
10	zk1	Now everything ready.
11	5	So, where is this "founder"\nperson, anyway?
12	zk1	Near to here.
13	zk1	At top of back alley steps.
evt/nq/msg_nq310207f.json
0	jn1	Where's the tribute?
1	zk1	Here. As desire, extra-sweet\nPlumage Honey Torpedo wrap!
2	jn1	Perfect!
3	@k1	...Gah?!
4	wk1	Hi!

8	zk1	Gigi make introduction.\nThis is creator of treasure hunt!
9	@k1	...
10	zk1	Wait please!
11	zk1	Gigi understand.
12	zk1	Azalea always looking outside here...
13	zk1	Azalea go out at nighttime\nand play alone.
14	zk1	What Azalea really want\nis not Torpedo wrap.
15	zk1	It friends to play with.
16	@k1	Er, no?! I don't need friends!
17	zk1	Azalea...
18	2	Something's eating you up, isn't it?\nSomething sad.
19	2	What was it that happened?
20	@k1	...
21	2	What are you thinking?\nWill you tell me?
22	@k1	...
23	@k1	...If I'm alone... I can't get\nany more lonely than this...
24	@k1	Mum got ill and died...and Dad hasn't\ncome home from battle yet...
25	@k1	Mum...got ill and died...
26	@k1	I hate...being left behind...
27	wk1	Oh... That's a sad goodbye to make.
28	wk1	My mum passed away as well,\nso I know how you feel.
29	@k1	Yours too...?
30	wk1	But this is different.
31	wk1	I had so much fun today solving\nthose clues! And everyone helped!
32	wk1	Maybe one day we won't be together\nany more, but that makes it even more\nimportant to be together now, right?
33	wk1	Like, if we weren't together now,\nI'd just regret it later!
34	xk1	What kind of games do\nyou like to play, Azalea?
35	@k1	I don't really know...
36	wk1	OK, then our next game is finding\nsomething Azalea likes!
37	xk1	I love solving tough problems!
38	xk1	Which is why I had so much fun\nwith your puzzles, Azalea!
39	@k1	Well, I guess, but...
40	xk1	C'mon, give us another! Hit me!
41	@k1	Er, you want me to... Now?!
42	wk1	Whoever solves it wins\nthe Torpedo wrap!
43	@k1	But there's only one!
44	wk1	Then you'd better play to win!\nOK, who goes first?
45	xk1	Me, I'll do it!
46	@k1	H-hey! How can I win if\nI don't even get to answer?!
47	2	That all worked out rather nicely.
48	zk1	Gigi very grateful. Thank you.
49	zk1	Question of how to find Azalea friends\nto play with was hardest puzzle of all.
50	zk1	Gigi unable to solve this puzzle\nfor longest time, so that why Gigi\nget everyone involved.
51	1	I think this was a nice opportunity.

0	2	So about this sheet music\nwe found in the City...
1	2	I gave it a play, and the melody made me\nreally happy for some reason.
2	2	It's so strange. It's completely different\nto off-seer melodies...
3	2	I gave it a try and it turns out it's\na really cheerful piece of music.
4	2	It looks like only half the music\nis in here, though. I'd really like\nto know the rest.
5	1	Someone in the City will have\ndropped it. Should we see if we\ncan find who it belongs to?
6	2	Yes, please!
7	1	OK, let's find somewhere with plenty\nof people and try asking around.
evt/nq/msg_nq310301t.json

1	vk1	Oh, that's Grandad's!

3	vk1	He can't keep doing this!
4	2	Would you mind introducing us to him?\nWe'd actually quite like to meet him.
5	vk1	Yeah, why not?
6	vk1	OK, you can help me find him!
7	vk1	Knowing Grandad, he's probably\nstanding on a bridge somewhere,\nworrying himself sick.
8	2	Thank you.
9	vk1	He's really hard to talk to...
10	2	Hm?
evt/nq/msg_nq310302f.json

3	vk1	Grandad, you dropped\nyour sheet music again!
4	vk1	You can't just say you can't write good\nmusic and throw everything away!
5	2	Wait, you wrote this piece?
6	2	We wanted to know how the rest of\nit went, so we came looking for you.
7	2	It's such a lovely melody! I'd love to\nbe able to play it all the way through.
8	2	Uhm... Did he hear me?

6	vk1	I think Grandad enjoyed himself.
7	1	We had fun playing together too!
8	3	Pretty different from your off-seeing\ntunes, innit? Feels a lot more...jaunty.
9	4	It's true, the simple act of listening\nmakes you feel connected to everyone\naround you. How bizarre.
10	9	Manana would like to listen again!
11	1	I'd like to write something\nlike that one day, too.
12	2	You will. I'm sure of it.

1	Xl1	Waaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!
2	5	Whoa, let's not be hasty, mate!
3	Xl1	Hm?
4	9	He go splat?!
5	Xl1	Excuse me, people walking up above!\nI wonder if you'd help me out a tad?
6	Xl1	...I see now where the mix-up came to\npass. You must have thought I meant\nto end my life!
7	Xl1	I only meant to do some practice falls!
8	Xl1	You see the war room waiting there below,\nso there was never any concrete risk.
9	8	Friend land on anything friend want, but\nfrom this height, death not optional...
10	5	Why would you even want to do this?!
11	Xl1	To gain permission for\nmy true love's hand!
12	6	Hand? What hand?
13	Xl1	Her hand, my dear -\nin marriage, nothing less!
14	Xl1	A Jeweled Pebble's what a suitor needs,\nif he's to have his marriage recognized.\nSo I have promised thus to bring one home!
15	4	I see. So a "marriage" necessitates\nfinding this pebble?
16	Xl1	Our problem's really of another kind.\nYou see, our family standings are of such...
17	Xl1	Ah, wait, you are outsiders, are you not?
18	Xl1	My lady love is of a noble house,\nand their old-fashioned representative\nis not inclined to bless our wedding wish...
19	Xl1	I begged and pleaded for a hundred days,\nand finally the answer came back: "Yes"!
20	1	So you need to find the Jeweled Pebble\nto prove your worth.
21	2	But what does that have to do with\nflinging yourself from high places...?
22	Xl1	A Jeweled Pebble's only found one place:\nat Lavi Sandbar is the place it sleeps,\na site in yonder Erythia Sea!
23	Xl1	The sandbar, though, may prove a testing\ntask. At far remove from City fair it lies,\nits shore reached only by one with a boat...
24	Xl1	Of course, I haven't access to a boat,\nso swimming is the only choice I have!
25	Xl1	I estimate the swim will take ten days,\nso till then I must fortify myself!
26	Xl1	And what more bracing action can\nthere be than leaping from some\nhigh-up, lonely place?
27	Xl1	The Nopon of the caravan, it was,\nwho told me of this brilliant technique.
28	Xl1	I hear that it's a well-respected way\nto get a marriage recognized, in fact.
29	1	I...I see...?
30	Xl1	And that is why, my friends,\nI tell you true: you needn't worry\nover this man, here!
31	Xl1	My training has begun in earnest, yes!\nMy Joulietta waits for my success!
32	3	Your Joulietta's going to be waiting\na long time if you kill yourself jumping\noff high things, mate.
33	1	Romero?
34	1	You said the pebble's all you need?
35	Xl1	Correct.
36	1	We have our own vessel. We could\ntake you up to Lavi Sandbar.
37	Xl1	You will?!
38	Xl1	By ship, the trip's much less than\nten days long! I'd be so grateful if\nyou'd help me out!
39	4	And where might we find\nthis Lavi Sandbar?
40	Xl1	I'll send your Iris where our target lies.
41	Xl1	It won't be long now\ntill my goal is reached...
42	Xl1	Sweet Joulietta, wait a little more!

1	Xl1	I'm fine, my friend, just taken unawares.
2	8	Was looking very awares to Riku.
3	1	Look, we got the Jeweled Pebble back.
4	Xl1	Oh...
5	2	Now you can marry Joulietta.
6	Xl1	My gratitude's eternal to you all!
7	Xl1	I must get back to where my darling waits,\nand whisper in her ear the happy news.
8	Xl1	Ah yes, why not? I'll take the chance as\nwell to introduce you heroes to my love!
9	Xl1	She waits for me in Michiba Canteen!\nA place that holds a thousand memories.

11	1	OK.
evt/nq/msg_nq310403f.json
0	Xl1	My Joulietta!
1	Yl1	Oh, Romero mine!
2	Yl1	I can't believe you really found the thing!
3	Xl1	I'm only sorry that I made you wait.
4	Yl1	What nonsense, dear!\nIt's all my father's fault.
5	Yl1	And who is this?
6	Xl1	Some friends who helped me out.
7	Xl1	I hear that Garrett's here as well...
8	Yl1	Yes. Here.
9	3	Wait... Is Garrett Joulietta's father?
10	Yl1	See, Father, it's exactly as I said!\nRomero kept his word and found the stone!
11	Zl1	Yep, that's definitely a Jeweled Pebble.
12	Zl1	Did you find this on your own?
13	Xl1	I had some help from these,\nmy worthy friends! Ouroboros,\nthey are - or did you know?
14	Xl1	Such stout companions! Also, did you\nknow? They're going to end the war with\nMoebius too!
15	Zl1	Well, you've certainly kept your promise\nand brought back a Jeweled Pebble.
16	Zl1	But don't forget, this task was set to\nsee if you're worthy of Joulietta.
17	Zl1	If other people helped you, I don't think\nwe can use it to judge your worthiness.
18	Xl1	...Ah, yes.\nI see how that might be the case.
19	Zl1	And I believe I said this too...
20	Zl1	One of the conditions for marrying\nJoulietta is to leave the Lost Numbers.
21	Xl1	B-but-
22	Zl1	Joulietta's a Doyle, one of the Six Houses.
23	Zl1	I'm not marrying her off to someone\nracing to die in the fight against Moebius.
24	Xl1	I-
25	Zl1	And what about the\nother marriage condition?
26	Yl1	Why, Father, is there more we have to do?

28	Xl1	To this I say...to this I have to say...
29	Xl1	I won't leave my Lost Numbers\nfriends behind!
30	Xl1	I signed up for your Joulietta's sake!\nI fight to save the world for her alone!

32	Zl1	Sorry. Them's the terms.\nYou want to marry her? Then retire.
33	Xl1	...Ngh...
34	Yl1	O cruel man, to say such awful things!
35	Yl1	You never understand! I hate you! Ugh!

0	2	...A "novel"?
1	3	They're all the rage in the City.\nSome kind of book or something, I dunno.
2	5	A book? Can't be that good then.
3	1	I get the feeling they're pretty\ndifferent from the textbooks\nwe used to have to read.
4	2	Oh? Different how?
5	1	I don't know the details.\nAre you curious, though, Mio?
6	2	Just a little.
7	3	Should we read one of these\n"novels" and see what it's like?
8	2	Yes, let's see if we can\nfind one to buy in the City.
evt/nq/msg_nq310501t.json
0	al1	Welcome to shop of Wellwell!\nWhat Wellwell can do for friends?
1	2	We were wondering...\nif you have any...novels?
2	al1	Novels! Of course! Question borders on silly.\nWhat genre friends looking for?
3	2	Wh-what, sorry? Jon-ra...?
4	3	Look, we have no idea, OK?\nWhat's popular in the City?
5	al1	You want popular novel? That easy!\nCurrent bestseller is latest volume of\nFounders' Tale!
6	4	The Founders' Tale...?\nThat's the title of a novel, is it?
7	al1	Right on money!\nWould friends care to buy?
8	al1	Feel free to try before friends buy!\nHave skim through pages, see if you like.
9	al1	Founders' Tale is high recommendation\nof Wellwell! Friends not regret purchase!
10	al1	Thankings for patronage!\nFriends chose well to choose Wellwell!
evt/nq/msg_nq310502f.json
0	al1	Story of Founders' Tale is epic\nnarrative of Ouroboros who were\nfirst founders of City.
1	4	So it's a record that the Founders\nthemselves left behind?
2	al1	That right! That framing device of novel.
3	3	Framing what?
4	1	Wait, are you sure you can afford\nto sell something so important for\nsuch a low price?
5	al1	That interesting take. Friends certainly\nhave lively sense of curiosity...
6	al1	Wellwell do one better. Why not meet\nMiss Leeanne, author of novel, directly?
7	2	We can meet the person who\nactually wrote this book?
8	al1	Miss Leeanne often go for\nconstitutional in Virid Park.
9	al1	She lady of lofty wisdoms,\nso Wellwell certain that she able\nto satisfy friends' curiosity.
evt/nq/msg_nq310503f.json
0	2	Excuse me, but would you\nhappen to be Leeanne?
1	bl1	I would indeed. Can I help you?
2	2	Wellwell told us that you're the person\nwho wrote The Founders' Tale.
3	bl1	Goodness! To think that our generation\nof Ouroboros would take an interest in\nmy humble scribbles!
4	5	Basically, we don't really\nget this whole "novel" thing.
5	bl1	...Ahaha, of course, of course.\nThat's only natural.
6	bl1	I believe there isn't much in the way of\nprinted storytelling outside the City, correct?
7	2	Yes, I'd say so...\nIs it something like a diary?
8	bl1	Hmm... Well, you're not entirely wrong,\nin that I'm trying to recreate in detail\nthe lives of the Founders...
9	bl1	But it's different from a real diary,\nbecause I've made most of it up.
10	2	What do you mean, you made it up...?
11	bl1	Well, to put it simply...\nIt's sort of all lies.
12	5	What?! You just pulled it\nout of your arse?
13	bl1	Of course, I do strive to the best of\nmy ability to make sure it hews close\nto the truth.
14	bl1	There are so few documents and materials\nleft in the City from the Founders' times.
15	bl1	So regardless, I would always have had\nto weave guesses and interpretations\ninto my work to fill the gaps.
16	bl1	...That said, it's probably time\nto lay down my pen.
17	1	What do you mean? You don't\nwant to write any more?
18	bl1	Imagination has its limits. I find I've come\nto the end of the line. I just don't know\nwhere I'd take the story from here.
19	3	But you're mega popular, ain't you?\nDoesn't everyone love your novels?
20	bl1	They do, which is why I've been\nhoping for inspiration to strike...
21	bl1	...Though, you could say inspiration\nreally has dropped from the heavens\nright in front of me.
22	4	Pardon?
23	bl1	This truly is serendipity. Would you mind\nhelping me conquer my writer's block?
24	2	Block...?
25	4	Today's just a day for learning\nnew concepts, I suppose...
26	bl1	According to the records, the\nsix Founders traveled throughout\nthe world looking for a new land.
27	bl1	I've managed to pinpoint the exact\nlocations they visited on their journey,\nto help further my research.
28	bl1	Unfortunately, I lack the robust\nconstitution to be a soldier. Would\nyou visit those places in my stead?
29	3	What exactly d'you want us to look for?
30	bl1	Hmm, let me see... If you happen upon\nanything that looks out of the ordinary\nthere, you could bring it back.
31	bl1	I'm trying to see if there's anything out\nthere beyond the information we have\nin the records.
32	2	What are the locations\nyou'd like us to look at?
33	bl1	The Distant Fingertip and the\nDannagh Desert in the Fornis\nregion would be a great start.
34	bl1	Then a couple of places in Pentelas:\nthe Ruins of Seebu, and the\nOld Cliffside Way.
35	bl1	Finally, a place in Cadensia\ncalled the Eternal Canopy.\nAnd that should be all.
36	5	So you're asking us to go to\nall those places? Seriously?
37	bl1	Get all your hardships out of the way\nwhile you're young. Once you get old, you\ncan't do the fun stuff even if you want to.
38	bl1	I can't hold anything much heavier than\na pen these days. Curse this old body!
39	2	...We'll help you. And we'll report\nback if we find anything.
40	bl1	Thank you. I'll be waiting to\nhear back from you young folk!
evt/nq/msg_nq310504t.json
0	bl1	You're back! Did you find anything?
1	bl1	Need a reminder of the locations? Gladly!\nFirst, it was the Distant Fingertip and\nDannagh Desert in the Fornis region.
2	bl1	Then, in Pentelas, it was the Ruins of Seebu\nand the Old Cliffside Way...
3	bl1	And finally, in Cadensia, some place\ncalled the Eternal Canopy... And that's it!
4	bl1	I look forward to hearing your findings,\ndear youngsters!
evt/nq/msg_nq310505f.json
0	bl1	Hmm, let me see...
1	3	All we found was this junk. Sorry\nwe couldn't get anything better.
2	bl1	Not at all, not at all! This is\nwonderful. It's a better result\nthan I could have hoped for.
3	4	Really? I don't see anything here\nthat has even the slightest connection\nto the Founders...
4	bl1	No, you're right. None of this\nis related to the Founders.
5	5	Ugh, are you joking?
6	bl1	But these things don't exist in any of our\nrecords. They're completely unknown.
7	bl1	They may not be associated with the\nFounders, but they have more worth\nthan that alone.
8	3	...This has gotta be a wind-up.\nIt's just a bunch of rubbish!
9	6	Hey, do you think the Levnises that\nattacked us were looking for these?
10	bl1	Oh, sounds like you had a bit of\nan adventure! Now you've really\npiqued my interest.
11	bl1	Just what are these? It's hard to imagine\nthey come from our time...or even the\nFounders' time...
12	bl1	Could they be...even older...?
13	bl1	...Yes! It's coming to me!
14	2	What?! What's coming?
15	bl1	My inspiration!\nAh, it's all rushing back to me!
16	bl1	The old gray matter hasn't failed me yet!\nYou've saved my work. Thank you!
17	1	You're sure this is fine?
18	bl1	Of course! Now, I'm sorry,\nbut I must go!
19	bl1	I want to put pen to paper while\nthese ideas are still fresh!
20	2	Wait...! Can we ask you\none more question?
21	bl1	What is it?
22	2	Why did you decide to write about\nthe Founders in the first place?
23	bl1	Oh, that's a good question.
24	bl1	Have you ever wondered\nabout where you came from?
25	4	...What do you mean?
26	bl1	This is just my own theory...
27	bl1	But I think one of the most important\nthings in life is knowing your origins.
28	bl1	That's what I want the people of the City\nto know. Or rather, to remember.
29	bl1	Where we all came from, and\nwhere we're going. Do you see?
30	bl1	Anyway, I really must go now! I hope\nyou enjoy the next book in the series!
evt/nq/msg_nq310506f.json
0	3	Oh, for crying out loud.
1	5	What are they doing here?!
2	1	Save it for later. Here they come!
3	2	Here as well?!
4	4	Are they targeting us?\nOr perhaps...
5	5	Who cares? Let's take them down!
6	5	...I think this might be more\nthan just coincidence.
7	6	Do you think they're after\nthe same thing we are?
8	3	Heh. If that's true, then I guess\nwe're onto something pretty good!

1	R	Yeah.
2	3	No need to be so standoffish, mate.\nYou're allowed to talk, you know.
3	R	Don't usually bother\nwith trivial stuff.
4	2	So... You have a wife, don't you?\nDo you want to go and see her?
5	R	Fine either way.
6	5	Come on, that's no good.\nShe'll want to see you.
7	R	...
8	1	You can always drop in while you're\ngiving your report for the Lost Numbers.
9	3	Oh yeah! You kept all that about the\nLost Numbers quiet, didn't you?
10	R	I told you I don't talk\nabout unimportant stuff.
11	3	...Cannot believe this bloke...
12	3	Let's have it out, then.\nProposal: let's go and\nsee this wife of yours.

11	3	What's with all this bluntness?\nAren't you supposed to at least\nlike this woman?!
12	dl1	Hahaha...! What do you say to that, Gray?
13	R	...
14	2	Er...
15	dl1	But it's true, we are partners, to\nput it in terms you'd understand.
16	dl1	Oh, before I forget. A work\nthing came up for you, Gray.
17	R	What thing?
18	dl1	Request from Monica.\nI'll take you there.

15	gl1	That long and short of it.
16	3	So this kind of stuff is your job too? I\nthought it was to just point guns at us.
17	R	Hmph...
18	1	So what are these materials you need?
19	dl1	Oh, you know Hollis, the doctor?
20	2	What about him?
21	dl1	He has some things in stock that\nthese two would like you to get hold of.
22	3	What, go to the doctor's...? Could you not\nhave just gone and done that yourselves?
23	gl1	When we walk out in public there\nalways annoying people who say\nall kind of thing to us...
24	dl1	They do, don't they? And then you have\nthe conservatives and the hardliners...
25	dl1	So we'd like to ask you to do it.
26	5	...What is this?
27	4	It's sending out suitably powerful friends\nto do a job for you, to keep annoying\nloudmouths quiet. That's what it is.
28	4	If Gray's on the case, people will\nthink twice about interfering, yes?
29	dl1	Yes, exactly. I'll go too. There\nare things I'd like to talk about.

6	5	What kind of trouble?
7	fl1	Rozana, you're a right firecracker. I guess\nI can't refuse, given the debt I owe you.

41	5	Weird way to repay a debt though, eh?

43	hl1	We don't know how long we've got, so\nI like to keep my regrets to a minimum.
44	N	I understand that. If you miss your chance\nto act, it might not come again, eh?
45	N	OK, ye lubbers! Now be good and\ndo as the man says! Got that?

52	N	You'll be repaid soon enough!\nWe like your spirit! Think of the\ngrog, lads and lasses!
53	hl1	And this man is a Moebius...?\nWhat an oddball...
54	3	Sorry about all this, Playne.
55	hl1	...No, I mean, he's interesting.
56	hl1	Would you be able to bring them to\nthe war room when we're back?
57	1	Us?
58	hl1	Bringing a Moebius into the City might...\ncause a lot of hassle that we don't need\nright now. You understand that, right?
59	1	Y-yeah...
60	hl1	OK, then I'll see you back in the City!
61	pf1	I wonder what they'll serve for dinner...
62	qf1	Api and the others are still back in the\ncolony. We'd better invite them too!
63	5	I think you'd better ask first...
evt/nq/msg_nq310705f.json
0	pf1	Whoooaaa!
1	qf1	I've never seen food like this!
2	pf1	It's so good!
3	hl1	They all seem pretty friendly.
4	hl1	Ah, please, you join us as well.
5	hl1	We have to discuss\nwhat to do about them.
6	hl1	So this is how it is.
7	hl1	You can roam the City freely.
8	hl1	But at the first sign of trouble from you,\nthe senate might change their minds.
9	hl1	Triton, however, is not allowed to enter\nor leave the City unless expressly\naccompanied by Ouroboros.
10	4	When you said they'd be taken into\ncustody, I didn't think it'd be so...relaxed.
11	hl1	We find being accommodating is more\neffective. And I'm heir to the headship of\nthe Ortiz family, of the Six Houses.
12	5	Ortiz? I've heard that name before...
13	hl1	You probably know Timna, my mother.
14	3	No way...
15	5	Then you're...!
16	hl1	Let me introduce my little eyes and ears...
17	hl1	My son, Shiner.
18	2	That means you're...!
19	wk1	Thanks for helping my dad!
20	qf1	But he's so small!
21	qf1	Or is it me that's big?!
22	5	No, mate, that's not...\nUgh, you know what, I can't\nbe bothered explaining.
23	wk1	You live in the City so now we're friends!\nI'll tell you everything you need to know!
24	qf1	OK, then tell us more about\nthe delicious food!
25	pf1	And me!
26	wk1	No, not that!
27	hl1	We have rules here.
28	wk1	Yeah! You came from the outside,\nso some people might not like you\nstraight away.
29	wk1	But when they get to know you,\nI bet you'll make loads of friends.
30	qf1	Wait, so, do we live here now?
31	wk1	How do you not even know?!\nYou're so much older than me!
32	wk1	Ugh OK, I'll explain one more time,\nso this time listen!
33	1	Monica's calling.
34	D0600	I heard you brought in some\nfolks from Colony 15.
35	10300	Yeah. Thanks for letting them in.
36	D0400	They're welcome, sure, but\nultimately it's up to them.
37	D0400	And I assume you-know-who is still\nwith you. Let me switch to a channel\nhe can hear.
38	10300	OK...?
39	D0400	Triton, you copy?
40	N0300	Arrr, I'm in the middle of something\nright now. It's dinnertime, you know.
41	D0400	Shut your mouth and open your ears.
42	D0800	You'll guarantee the safety of the prisoners\nwith your actions. End of message.
43	N	...Prisoners, you say?
44	hl1	I have no doubt you've brought a lot of\nchaos to the City, but I for one welcome it.
45	hl1	And of course I welcome the\nColony 15 newcomers, too.
46	N	You're a strange one yourself, aren't ye?
47	hl1	I come from a family of engineers.
48	hl1	They taught me not to be prejudiced, but\nto judge things based on their usefulness.
49	hl1	And yes, even when I'm faced\nwith a Moebius.
50	wk1	Whaaat?! You were a Moebius all along?!
51	N	In the flesh, squirt!
52	N	So, what you gonna do about it?\nYou wanna beat me up? I'll take\nyou on anytime!
53	N	Not that ye'd be able to defeat me!
54	wk1	...
55	wk1	Oh yeah? I'll beat you up easy\nif you ever do anything bad!
56	wk1	Don't worry, Dad!
57	wk1	I've got my eye on him!
58	wk1	And...
59	wk1	If it turns out he's a good person\nthen I'll tell everyone in the City.
60	hl1	Shiner...
61	N	Oh, you will, will you? Gahahaharrr!!!\nYe're an interesting pair of lubbers!
62	N	Ye've got guts! This old sea dog will\nbehave himself a little while longer then.
63	wk1	Uh-huh. You better!
evt/nq/msg_nq310791t.json
0	of1	Mehhh!\nEveryone run off and skive off job!
1	of1	Api show them what for\nwhen they come back!
evt/nq/msg_nq310800s.json
0	2	It's understandable that people\nare stressed and worried, what with\neverything that's happened...
1	2	But the City folk are really starting\nto get up in arms about it.
2	5	...I guess raids were normal for us\nback in the colonies. We just took\nthat kind of thing for granted.
3	4	To them, fighting was something\nthat happened in the outside world.
4	4	You can understand how seeing one of\ntheir fundamental beliefs shattered is\ngoing to cause some unhappiness.
5	5	Suppose.
6	3	But then you've got those conservative\ntypes who were already afraid this kinda\nthing would happen.
7	3	Seems like they're already\nin a state of panic.
8	6	You're right. Everything feels quite\nprecarious right now... I hope everyone\nin the City's OK.
9	D	I've been thinking to check in on Travis\nas well, see how things are going.
10	D	Want to tag along?
11	1	Yeah, OK.
12	1	Should we maybe talk to\nMonica and Travis about it all?
13	2	I think we should.
14	2	I hope we can do something to help...
evt/nq/msg_nq310801f.json
0	tk1	Yeah, there's a lot of\ndisgruntlement in the City.
1	tk1	House Doyle are working on it,\nso for now I've been leaving it in\ntheir hands.
2	D	Got it. In that case, I'll see\nwhat Garrett has to say.
3	D	Yeah, lots of unhappy voices\nin the City these days.
4	D	The Doyles are acting as\nmediators at the moment.
5	D	I'm just waiting for Garrett to give\nme a summary of the situation.
6	tk1	For once, I'm grateful for his meddling!
7	D	I'm afraid he'll align himself with these\n"concerned citizens" in the end...
8	tk1	So that's where we're at.
9	tk1	Now we just have to work out how to-
10	@m1	We've got trouble!
11	D	What's going on?
12	@m1	A number of Armory units have\ntaken off without authorization!
13	@m1	Seems they were commandeered\nby soldiers and civilians alike.
14	@m1	The soldiers on guard...seem to have\nbeen bribed to look the other way...
15	D	Travis.
16	tk1	It's just one thing after another...
17	D	Assess the situation ASAP.
18	D	You've been careless.\nI'll hear your excuses later.
19	tk1	Ugh...
20	tk1	I'll see what's going on!
21	1	Monica.
22	1	This means people who aren't in the Lost\nNumbers have left the City, doesn't it?
23	2	But what are they hoping to accomplish?
24	D	...
25	tk1	We've found them, boss!
26	tk1	We tracked the signal of the\nstolen Armory units. Seems they're\nheaded towards Vinisog Holm.
27	D	Understood. We'll head out there.
28	tk1	Personally?
29	D	Naturally. Prepare for immediate departure.
30	tk1	One step ahead of you, boss.
31	1	Monica, we'll come too.
32	D	OK.
33	D	Travis, I'll go on ahead,\nand they'll come with me.
34	D	Get ready to provide support\nthe second you're in formation.
35	tk1	Understood!
36	D	We'll make a move as\nsoon as we're ready.
37	D	Can I ask you to go on ahead\nand provide some defense?
38	1	Of course.
39	1	Let's get to Vinisog Holm!
evt/nq/msg_nq310802f.json
0	D	They've even brought out the Automatons.
1	jl1	Elder...
2	D	How about you tell me just what\nit is you think you're doing.
3	jl1	Ouroboros...
4	2	So you're the ones who stole\nthese Armory units.
5	2	Why did you come out here?
6	jl1	We want independence from the City.
7	jl1	We should apologize for\nthe...crudeness...of our departure.
8	jl1	But we'd like you to leave us\nin peace from now on.
9	D	Well, this is complicated.
10	1	Did you talk this through with Monica?
11	jl1	...
12	jl1	I'm sorry that this might get a bit violent,\nbut I'll have to ask you to leave now!
13	1	...Oof.
14	5	Maybe you'll feel more like chatting\nwhen your Automatons are all lying\nin a neat little scrapheap!
evt/nq/msg_nq310803f.json
0	D	Now. Why do you want your\nindependence so badly?
1	1	What made you want\nto leave the City?
2	jl1	I would have thought you could work it out.
3	jl1	You must have heard the story\nof the old City, built somewhere\nelse, destroyed by Moebius.
4	D	...Yeah, I know the story.
5	jl1	We heard about it from Garrett.
6	jl1	And there was that Moebius attack.
7	jl1	And there was that Moebius raid.
8	jl1	If they ever actually get past our\ndefenses, there won't be anything\nwe can do about it...
9	jl1	We came to the conclusion that\nwe had no option but to leave\nif we wanted to stay alive.
10	D	...I see.
11	jl1	We don't really care if you accuse\nus of cowardice. This is our choice\nfor our future.
12	jl1	Our aim is to avoid the total\nannihilation of the City.
13	jl1	If we survive, then we can build up our\nstrength, and in a few hundred years we\nmight even be able to tackle Moebius.
14	D	...
15	D	I understand your point of view.
16	D	But, as Elder, I have to\norder you back to the City.
17	jl1	But-
18	jl1	We aren't trying to stop the\nLost Numbers from fighting!
19	jl1	So why?!
20	D	You didn't make any preparations\nbefore you left the City, did you?
21	jl1	Well, I mean-...
22	D	If Garrett backs you up on this,\nthen you should present your plans\nformally to the senate.
23	jl1	...Oh.
24	D	I'm not denying your choice. So will you\ngo back and think your plan through?
25	jl1	...
26	jl1	...OK. We'll talk it through with Garrett.
27	3	You sure you haven't just caused\na massive sparkstorm there?
28	D	If they can come up with a workable\nplan, then we can analyze it.
29	D	The future has many potential forms.
30	D	They'll probably have sorted\nsomething out by the time we\nsettle things with Moebius.
31	1	...I guess, yeah.
32	D	Sorry to drag you out here.
33	D	We should head back too.
evt/nq/msg_nq310900s.json
0	2	I guess Romero and Joulietta probably\nhaven't been able to get married yet...
1	5	Yeah, if they had, Romero would've\ngiven us a whole speech about it.
2	2	I can see it now!
3	3	There a reason you brought those two up?
4	2	I heard Joulietta's been seen all\nover the City lately, that's all.
5	2	I think she might be trying to get\ntheir wedding approved somehow.
6	3	Ah, so she's the one jumping\nthrough hoops this time?
7	6	Romero was so fired up about it too.\nIs it really so hard to get married?
8	2	It seems like the problem concerns more\nthan just the two of them, so it must be...
9	4	If you're worried about them,\nwe could always ask around\nand see how they're doing?
10	3	I'd feel a bit bad if Romero did himself\na mischief while we weren't watching.
11	6	There's probably something we\ncan do to help, anyway, Mimi!
12	2	You're right!
13	2	Let's see if anyone knows what's going\non with Romero and Joulietta, then.
evt/nq/msg_nq310901t.json
0	2	Joulietta, I wanted to ask\nyou something, if that's OK...
1	Yl1	I'm sorry, friends, I'm rather busy now.\nI've got to get things ready for a trip.
2	2	Get what things ready?
3	Yl1	I swear, when next we meet\nwe'll talk some more!
evt/nq/msg_nq310902t.json
0	2	Romero, do you know what's\ngoing on with Joulietta...?
1	Xl1	It's you! Your timing's great as ever! Yes!
2	2	Is everything all right?
3	Xl1	My Joulietta's joined the Numbers Lost.
4	Xl1	And so, at our next skirmish,\nshe'll be there.
5	Xl1	I must persuade my boss to let me go!\nMy only wish is that we fight as one!
6	Xl1	Her unit's being briefed precisely\nnow, at Sentridge Harbor. Would\nyou intervene?
7	2	You didn't stop her from joining up?
8	Xl1	Why yes, at first of course I did\nprotest. Then thought to let her\nfollow her own dreams.
9	2	We'll do our best for you.
10	Xl1	I thought it strange that she\nwould never meet. To think she\ntread a course so alike mine...
11	Xl1	Sentridge Harbor is where my\nlove will be. Stall them, please -\nat least till I arrive!
evt/nq/msg_nq310903f.json
0	sk1	So that's our strategy.\nStand by till we deploy.
1	_m1	Understood!
2	sk1	You! Stay focused. The battle's\nalready started. Remember that.
3	_m1	Y-yes ma'am!
4	5	Yep, voice like a Skwaror...
5	2	Psst! Joulietta!
6	Yl1	Oh, it's you again...!
7	4	When did you sign up\nwith the Lost Numbers?
8	Yl1	The very day that followed when we met.\nWhen poor Romero came to seek my hand.
9	Yl1	In fact, since I was but a tiny girl,\nI've wanted to be like our Monica.
10	Yl1	But woe, my father wouldn't let me join.\nHe said the soldier's life was not for me...
11	Yl1	But now I'm older, and it's past the time\nwhen I should act upon my own desires.
12	6	Do Garrett and Romero know...?
13	Yl1	Why, no!\nSo keep it deathly secret, if you please!
14	Yl1	I'm thinking when this coming fight is done,\nI'll tell them everything that's on my mind.
15	sk1	Keep this up and your first battle\nwill be nothing to worry about.
16	Yl1	Yes, ma'am!
17	sk1	You showed a lot of promise\neven when I was teaching you.\nI'm expecting great things.
18	sk1	Huh, are you here to help as well?
19	sk1	We're after something pretty\nhuge, so you'd be a big help!
20	5	What are you going for?
21	sk1	We're going to obtain "growth modules".
22	sk1	She's an excellent soldier but Joulietta\ndoesn't have combat experience yet.
23	sk1	I think it'd be good for her\nif you came along.
24	4	This is, without a doubt,\ngoing to end in combat.
25	3	Romero's not gonna\nmake it in time, is he?
26	1	We should go in his place, then, to make\nsure Joulietta doesn't do anything reckless.
27	1	Kabata, we're in.
28	sk1	I knew you would be!
29	sk1	OK, so the plan's simple. We attack the\nKevesi transport Levnis that's carrying\nthe cage.
30	sk1	We'll stage the attack at the base of the\nGreat Sword, in the N'ohm Wetlands.
31	sk1	Now, you can join either the vanguard\nor the rearguard. Which'll it be?
32		Do you prefer the van or the rear?
33		Vanguard.
34		Rearguard.
35	1	We'll take the vanguard.
36	1	We'll be able to pull off a pincer\nmaneuver with Joulietta.
37	1	We'll take the rearguard.
38	1	It'll be better to attack from\nbehind with Joulietta.
39	sk1	OK, let's get moving!
40	sk1	I've just sent you the rendezvous point.
41	sk1	We'll head out to the attack point.\nYou come along as soon as you're\nready, yeah?
42	1	Got it.
43	5	Well, we've fallen on our feet here.\nBetter we do this than Romero, anyway...
44	2	You might be right...
45	1	OK, let's keep Joulietta\nsafe and get this done.

1	5	Too right.
2	sk1	And we've got it! Well done, team!
3	sk1	Let's get this bad boy back!
4	_m1	Yes, ma'am!
5	sk1	I'll issue your rewards over at\nSentridge Harbor. I wouldn't hang\naround this place for too long.
6	1	Understood.
7	3	So much for sticking to the plan.\nIt'd be nice if she doesn't hare off\non her own next time...
8	6	Yeah, but she really did fight well!
evt/nq/msg_nq310906f.json
0	Zl1	Joulietta, why on Aionios would you\nbecome a soldier behind my back?
1	Yl1	My Father, don't you know\nthe reason why?
2	Zl1	All right. I'll play along. You kept it quiet\nbecause you knew I'd oppose you?
3	Zl1	You knew I'd put a stop to\nyour half-baked willfulness?
4	Zl1	Your debut fight. I hear you did well.
5	Yl1	What?
6	Zl1	This was your last day in the Lost\nNumbers, my girl. You'll quit now.
7	Yl1	I'm telling you that I intend to stay.
8	Zl1	Oh yeah?
9	Zl1	Daughter or not, I've got to draw the line.
10	Zl1	You're hereby disowned\nfrom House Doyle.
11	Xl1	Wha...?!
12	Xl1	But sir, did you not hear a word she said?!
13	Xl1	And Joulietta, please, you must-
14	Yl1	It's fine!
15	Yl1	Romero, see, we'll keep the City safe.\nTogether, unencumbered by a House!
16	Xl1	My Joulietta, darling, yes, of course...
17	sk1	Here, let me pay you back\nfor all the help you've been.
18	3	You're the one who spilt the\nbeans to Garrett, aren't you?
19	sk1	Yes, that was me.\nI couldn't keep it quiet.
20	sk1	I can't just go bringing noble daughters\nof the Six Houses to battle, can I?
21	2	Wait, you mean...?
22	sk1	I got permission this time.
23	sk1	I wish Garrett would just give his blessing.
24	sk1	The Six Houses can be\na nightmare sometimes, I swear...

0	fl1	Ah, this again?
1	2	Have you seen it before?
2	fl1	Since the City has moved location,\nthe people have had to attune to a\ncompletely new environment.
3	fl1	Patients keep being rushed in because\ntheir bodies are weakened by the change.
4	D	...This many, huh.
5	3	Oh, hey, Monica.
6	D	I didn't realize there were\nso many patients.
7	Zl1	You seriously didn't expect\nthis would happen?
8	Zl1	Obviously I understand that we had to move\nto avoid being wiped out by Moebius...
9	Zl1	But moving to a place a whole\n2,000 metri below ground level...
10	fl1	OK, that's enough of that.
11	fl1	I know the remedy. As long as we get\nthe medicine, everyone'll be right as rain.
12	Zl1	Hah, wishful thinking.
13	Zl1	I'll send for extra medical supplies.\nLet us know what you need.
14	fl1	I will, thank you.
15	fl1	Right, then.
16	D	And, Doctor, if there's anything\nI can do to help...
17	3	Doc, is there anything\nwe can do to help?
18	fl1	There is. If patients keep coming in at\nthe current rate, we won't be able to\nprovide enough medicine.
19	fl1	Could you gather some Egg Seeds\nand Heavy Pomegranates for me?
20	fl1	You'll find them in the Cadensia region.
21	fl1	Oh, and Roccodori Root as well.\nThat's indigenous to Lavi Sandbar.

1	6	Yeah, Azalea's really started to\ncome out of her shell.
2	6	I'm glad it all worked out.
3	4	It must be nice to be so carefree,\nmingling with others regardless of\nposition or ideology...
4	4	But it doesn't seem as though everyone\ntakes that in such a positive light...
5	4	I find that marginally worrying.\nWhat do you all think?
6	2	This is about Shiner's gang getting\ntogether for their activities, right?
7	6	It makes sense that people might worry,\nif they don't know what's going on.
8	5	Does it matter though? They don't\nlook like they're up to mischief.
9	2	Hmm, I agree, but...
10	1	If you're worried about them,\nlet's just drop by.
11	1	If there's nothing going on, we can just\nhave a little chat, and that'll be that.

3	5	What? What are you running off for?
4	4	I assume there's something they\ndon't want us to know about.
5	5	OK, this does look a bit shifty. So...\nare they up to something nefarious?
6	4	What are you asking me for?\nHow should I know?
7	2	He's right. We should ask\nShiner and the others directly.
8	5	We'd better get after 'em, then.\nNo one outruns Lightning Lanz!

9	xk1	It was Neon's idea.
10	vk1	I found one of my grandad's old\naccessories while I was sweeping.
11	vk1	It was like a charm he wore\nwhen he was a soldier.
12	vk1	And then I thought hey, we\ncould make one of those!
13	6	Whaaat? It's handmade too?!
14	@k1	I didn't think we'd really do it...
15	vk1	But Azalea's the one who\nlooked up how to make it!
16	@k1	Yeah, well... You guys said you\nwanted to thank everyone, so...
17	wk1	That's Azalea all over! And\nshe had tons of fun doing it!
18	xk1	She was singing Mr. Boomer's\nsong constantly!
19	@k1	So what? I like it!
20	vk1	Anyway, take the ring into\nbattle with you, yeah?
21	wk1	We can't go out and fight ourselves,\n'cause we're kids...

25	xk1	That's what we made it for!

29	@k1	...

15	3	Oh!
16	3	That's the same as the thing we\nfought over when we first met!
17	4	I suppose he asked you\nto collect them for him.
18	6	Mr. Samon, do you need more\nOrigin metal for something?
19	gl1	Ship is already perfect!
20	gl1	But...if Samon have more, then more\neffective use can be found.
21	gl1	If Samon have Origin metal, then Samon\nable to construct thing like Blade of Noah!
22	5	Not bad.
23	5	...Wait, you can really do that?!
24	gl1	Samon can do this thing\nwith Ultimate Hammer!
25	gl1	Samon have this idea while\ntinkering with engine of Bravery.
26	3	You just randomly came up with that...?
27	gl1	If friends going to beat up boss of Moebius,\nthen friends want good Blade, yes?
28	2	Of course.
29	gl1	Good, then settled!
30	gl1	Friends find Origin shard to make Blades\nmore strong. But that not all!

0	4	It appears that what we'd call our tenth\nterm is the same as being twenty years old\nin the City. Well, not quite the same...
1	4	Well, that much I was aware of, but\nwho knew they had their own version\nof Homecoming...
2	5	OK, but this way they get to go\nthrough it without dying, yeah?
3	4	Yes... For us, it was ceremony which\nmarked the ending of things.
4	4	But for the people in the City, it's actually\na celebration of a beginning.
5	5	A beginning and end... One ceremony for\ntwo completely opposite things... Mental.
6	6	But...still. They have something in common,\ndon't they?
7	6	They're both celebrations of the fact\npeople came into being and managed\nto live their way through life!
8	1	That's right. And in the City, it has\none more meaning...
9	1	It's also a rite that represents the Founders'\ndesires and ambitions being taken up by\nthe next generation.
10	2	Finishing the tenth term is when they\nbecome "adults", and they see it as an\nespecially happy event...
11	2	But the reason it's so special is that even\nif they make it, they always know a lot of\npeople who didn't... People who died.
12	2	So it also reminds them of the weight\nthey carry in that sense, I think.
13	4	Those that made it into adulthood,\nand those that didn't... You could say\nit's a dual-purpose rite, then.
14	3	Whoa... That's not too far from us, huh.
15	3	We don't get to be adults, but we could\nstill honor their moment of transition.
16	3	It's like, I know we've got a lot to do still,\nbut we could surely wish them the best on\nthe first day of the rest of their lives?
17	D	...
18	5	Yeah, but... We heard that the Homecoming\nisn't going to happen this year. That right?
19	1	Yeah, I guess there must be\na reason for that.
20	2	Why don't we take a look into how the\nHomecoming ceremony looks in the City?
21	2	Depending on what's stopping it,\nwe might be able to figure out a way\nto get it going again...?
22	5	...Know what, I'd be buzzed to\npitch in. Especially for something\nso important.
23	D	It makes me very happy to hear you say\nthat. But I'm also conscious that time is\nvalued differently for you.
24	D	We can always postpone the event.\nThere's no need for you to use up your\nprecious-
25	5	Nah nah nah, it's fine.
26	5	Some of the people at Homecoming will be\nfighters, right? So if you postpone it, who's\nto say if they'll live long enough to see it.
27	5	If it can be done, you'd better do it.
28	D	Lanz... I don't know what to say.
29	3	Lanz has been making the Homecoming\nhis goal for so long, he can't bear to let\nit go, see.
30	5	...Oi! Nobody asked you for a digest,\nso shut your trap!
31	2	I can see it from Monica's point of view,\nsure. But I also think that we shouldn't\ngive up before we even try.
32	D	OK, I can see that you've set your hearts\non it. I can respect that.
33	3	All right! No time like the present!\nLet's go and see what we can see.
34	4	The Six Houses and people above their\ntwentieth year are likely to have some\nknowledge of this.

3	Xl1	An honored treasure of the sacred rite!\nOf metal wrought; its shape, Sophora\nleaves.
4	Xl1	Four proofs were once required, but 'tis no\nmore. A simpler rite persists in these dark\ndays, the world outside as hostile as it is.

1	3	Well, any information is welcome.\nBut things that would cause a problem\nby their lack sound like the ticket, yeah.
2	Yl1	You mean the rite's regalia,\nyes? Of course!
3	Yl1	A tree there is, Sophora is its name. And\nfrom its leaves are fashioned certain things,\nall worn upon the body in the rite.
4	3	Fashioned... Like, do you mean they make\nit themselves every time?
5	Yl1	As they are made from plants and\ngrowing things, they quickly die,\nand thus must be renewed.
6	4	Looking at it another way, it seems that\nthe effort required in making underlines\nthe importance of the ceremony.
7	Yl1	The rite's regalia are themselves a prayer,\nentreaties from their makers, if you will.
8	Yl1	The tree is evergreen, you see, and thus,\nits force of life is what we hope to draw.
9	Yl1	Its meaning is long life, abundance, wealth.\nThese things we hope to gain through this\none rite.
10	Yl1	The model of our bearing in this rite,\nis Kryto's as when he received the key.
11	Yl1	Such pride! Such self-belief! Such sweet\nresolve! A show the like we'll never see\nagain!
12	Yl1	Aspiring Ouroboros need such things.\nTo feel the future squirm within their\nhands...
13	Yl1	And I, for one, intend to seize it tight!

0	Zl1	Huh...? You're asking around about\nthe Homecoming rite, you say?
1	6	Yeah, we thought we'd like to know\nthe differences between your ceremony\nand ours, and stuff like that...
2	Zl1	I guess the main point of difference is that\nwe're given somewhere to live in the\nresidential district.
3	Zl1	In the City, once you've crossed the\nthreshold of the Homecoming, you'll be\ntreated as an adult.
4	Zl1	Handing over the key to a new property\nis like a celebration of that.
5	6	So you go to live somewhere different\nonce you've become an adult?
6	Zl1	If you're going to start a family, it's more\nor less essential.
7	Zl1	Nobody really wants to live their whole life\nin a dormitory, you know...?
8	Zl1	In practice, the Homecoming rite can spur\npeople on to settle down with a partner.
9	4	I see... So the Homecoming is a sort of\ncrossroads at which the circumstances of\none's environment change. Hmmm...
10	6	Wow, it all sounds like a really big deal,\nbecoming an adult...
11	Zl1	Joulietta has her Homecoming next year.\nI hope we'll be able to celebrate it just\nas grandly as this one.
12	Zl1	And after that...\nI daresay she'll be settling down.
13	Zl1	Can't say I'm thrilled that she's picked\nRomero for that, mind...
evt/nq/msg_nq311304t.json
0	5	Hey, you're old, right? Been around a\nwhile? You must know all about the\nHomecoming.
1	il1	Yes, I suppose I'm sort of an expert. After\nall, I've celebrated the Homecoming of\nmany hundreds of people by now.
2	il1	The ceremony has an extra significance,\nI think, as a celebration of the time that\nwe took back from Moebius.
3	il1	And of course, it isn't just for the people\ncoming of age. It's a yearly chance for\neveryone to let off some steam.
4	6	I see... So it's a fun event\nfor everyone, huh?
5	il1	Not just for fun though,\nyou must remember.
6	il1	Everyone at the ceremony gets a key for\ntheir new quarters, as a symbol of their\nnew independence.
7	il1	If young 'uns miss the cue to move out of\nthe dormitories, it's my job to give their\nbums a gentle smack to get them gone.
8	6	Huh...? So they aren't allowed\nto stay in the dormitories?
9	il1	What we really want them to do is get out\nthere and build a home for themselves that\nthey want to return to, you see.
10	il1	The reason we fight is to restore the\nnatural way of things for everyone,\nall people.
11	il1	That's our goal, not simply creating\nsoldiers that live a bit longer. I'd like\nyou to try to keep that in mind!
12	il1	Miyori was really well-behaved as a child.\nYes, no trouble at all, that one.
13	il1	It was welcome for us adults,\nbut now I wonder if it made her\nhappy to be that way...
14	il1	People oughtn't to live just to grant\nthe hopes of others. They should live\nfor themselves!
15	il1	Homecoming should act as a little nudge,\nI think, to help you really choose how\nyou're going to spend your future...
evt/nq/msg_nq311305t.json
0	3	Hiya, Kryto. Can we bend your ear\nabout something for a minute?
1	ll1	No worries. It's my day off. I can offer you\neven longer than a minute, if you like.
2	ll1	What's up, anyhow?\nWanna go somewhere else?
3	3	Oh...no... Right here's fine! It's nothing\nmajor or weird or anything.
4	5	It's coming up to your Homecoming\npretty soon, yeah? I guess I should say\ncongrats, or something?
5	ll1	Ahaha... That's what it was?\nWell, thanks. I'm touched.
6	ll1	If things were a little different, I suppose\nI'd be inviting you to come along to it.
7	ll1	But there are one or two problems in the\nway this year, so it's looking like the rite\nwon't take place, I'm sorry to say.
8	5	About that... So what exactly is the\nproblem this year, then?
9	ll1	Dunno exactly. Guess it just...\ndidn't come together, maybe?
10	ll1	It just got nixed from above, so I didn't\nreally pry, but that'd be my guess.
11	3	Are you OK with that though?\nIt's a real big deal of an event,\nisn't it?
12	ll1	Well, sure, but winning this fight we're in\nis an even bigger deal. There's not much\nwe can do about that.
13	ll1	It's a shame though. I was really looking\nforward to the banquet. After Homecoming,\nall the new adults usually make food.
14	ll1	This year's cohort had some real dab-hand\ncooks as well. I'm gutted I won't get to\nstrut my stuff as a chef too.
15	5	Whoa! There's a buffet at this thing?!
16	ll1	It's the custom to give thanks for the\ncelebration. A give-and-take kinda thing.
evt/nq/msg_nq311307t.json
0	6	Hey Playne, I bet you could teach us\nsomething about Homecoming, hm?
1	hl1	Yeah, I guess I've got a solid enough\nknowledge of it. Unavoidably so, I suppose,\nas the future head of House Ortiz.
2	4	Do you mean that the Six Houses are\nthe principal managers of the event?
3	hl1	Well, to be precise, the Senate handles it.\nWhy are you so interested in it?
4	6	We heard the ceremony might not be\ngoing ahead this year. We're curious\nabout the reason for that.
5	hl1	I see... Well, I don't know if this is the\nanswer to your question, but...
6	hl1	...approval hasn't come down from the\nSenate yet. Debates around tactical matters\nhave got everything else backed up.
7	hl1	It's life-and-death stuff, so naturally, it\ntakes priority over things that aren't.
8	4	Could I infer the following from what you\nsaid: If progress could be made without\nchanging priorities, the problem is solved?
9	hl1	Sure, that would work. I mean, if\nit really is possible, that is.
10	hl1	Travis clued me in about everything.\nI probably owe a word of thanks to\nyou all.
11	5	Ah, no need for that, really.\nWe really kinda did it for ourselves there.
12	hl1	Really? Well, thanks anyway.
13	hl1	I can get a little envious of you sometimes.\nYou're forging your own path, striking out\non your own.
14	hl1	I hope my son Shiner will grow up to be\nlike you, in his own time.
evt/nq/msg_nq311308t.json
0	5	Hey, Travis! How you doing?
1	tk1	Can't you tell by looking?\nHere, check out the bags under my eyes.\nThat give you a clue...?
2	4	Heartening as it is to see you thriving,\nwe came here with the purpose of putting\nsome questions to you, I'm afraid.
3	4	Specifically, about this year's Homecoming\nin the City. How are the preparations\ncoming along?
4	tk1	Ugh... You're really poking at the\nsore spots here, aren't you?
5	tk1	I already heard you've been asking around\nabout that. To be honest with you, things\nare looking tight for the Homecoming.
6	tk1	In any case, we've a huge military action\nahead of us. We can't prepare the rite till\nwe have all of that under control.
7	tk1	I mean, I appreciate that it's a once-in-a-\nlifetime thing. I'd love to celebrate it as\nwell, but something's had to give...
8	tk1	Oho! What an occasion! No matter how\nmany times I see it, the Homecoming\nalways hits the spot!
9	tk1	It's a day when you can just let it all\nhang out. Eat, dance and be merry,\nuntil your legs give way!
evt/nq/msg_nq311309s.json
0	3	Right, I guess we got a glimpse of all\nthe problems we need to handle there.
1		
2		
3	3	The first thing we need was...\nWhat was it... The Wreath of Sophora?
4	5	So we just need to go pick a few\nleaves or something for that, yeah?
5	1	After we've got the leaves, we'll need to\nthen fashion them into a crown, too.
6	1	We'll probably need the help\nof a craftsperson for that.
7	6	Then...there's the big banquet\nafterwards with the food made\nby the Homecomers.
8	6	That'll take a bit of preparation too.
9	4	We need to secure someone to\ntake central responsibility for the\nentire project.
10	4	Those with the most complete grasp\nof the ceremony would be the most\npromising candidates, I think.
11	3	Maybe we could ask Playne?
12	2	He already helped us out with that\nthing with Torto. I'd be loath to put\nany extra burdens on his back.
13	D	Why don't we rope Travis in?\nHe's got a finger in every pie\ngoing.
14	D	I can't really do anything officially, 'cause\nof my position and all, but I could help\nout by putting in a good word with him.
15	1	Thank you! That'd be a big help!
16	D	Please... I'm the one that\nought to be thanking you.
17	2	Let's make it a beautiful ceremony!
18	1	Yeah! Let's do that!
19	3	So...that leaves...
20	4	Travis, perhaps?
21	3	Yeah, he'd be good. Seems like he has\nsome pull with the senate as well...
22	3	Anyway, if he can do it, cool.\nIf he can't, we'll cross that\nbridge when we come to it.
23	2	OK! So the first order of business is\nspeaking to Travis, then.
evt/nq/msg_nq311310t.json
0	tk1	What...? You want me to handle the\npreparations for the Homecoming?
1	2	Well, everyone's been telling us that it's\nsuch an important event. We can't just\nleave it how things are!
2	5	I mean, at one time, the Homecoming\nwas something very important to us, too.
3	5	Marking the threshold, that's a big deal\nemotionally, man. We gotta get it done!
4	tk1	Ugh... You're costing me years of my life,\nyou know that...?
5	tk1	Well, you've done it. Sign me up!\nI've got it covered.
6	tk1	Oh! Look who it is.
7	tk1	It's OK. The boss already told me\nwhat you're after. The answer's yes!
8	5	Hehe... Things are looking up!
9	tk1	It's nothing to boast about, but I'm used\nto fielding these kinds of weird requests.
10	tk1	And, to tell you the truth, I'm as keen to\ndo something to get Homecoming back\non track as you lot are.
11	tk1	So, we'd better get to it, huh?
12	tk1	The first thing I'm gonna need from you is\nenough Sophora leaves to make enough\nWreaths of Sophora for the participants.
13	tk1	You can pick them on Daedal Isle.\nThis time round... 20 or so leaves\nshould do it.
14	tk1	I'll get the assembly sorted out on my side.\nWe'll also need to pull a few strings with the\nSenate.
15	tk1	Really we should have gotten approval first\nbefore going ahead... But I'll just have to try\nand talk our way around it.
16	5	I bet that'd be a cinch for you, Travis!
17	tk1	It's not a matter of being able or not able\nto do it, Lanz. It's more about whether I\ncan take the battering that comes with it.
18	tk1	But don't worry yourself too much about\nsuch tedious struggles between big folk.\nJust handle those leaves, OK?
19	2	We've got it. See you soon!
evt/nq/msg_nq311311t.json
0		You hand over the Sophora's Leaves.
1	tk1	OK, thanks for that! We should get the\nwreathes done in time thanks to these!
2	1	How did it go with the Senate?
3	tk1	Ugh... Don't ask, lad. You're only rubbing\nsalt into the wound.
4	tk1	Let's just say...I didn't exactly get out\nunscathed. But don't trouble yourself\nwith minor details like that.
5	tk1	The rest of this year's Homecomers will\nfind out soon enough, but would you mind\ngiving Kryto a heads-up about it first?
6	tk1	Knowing him, he'll be able to wrangle\neverything flawlessly, as per the usual.
evt/nq/msg_nq311312t.json
0	ll1	Huh? Really? Well, if that's the case,\nI'd better start preparing right away!
1	ll1	First I'll need to decide on a dish for the\nthank-you banquet... Hmmm... I'd better\nstick to the ingredients I have already.
2		
3		
4		
5		
6		
7	ll1	To complete the menu, we'll need\nPerfume Herbs, Thinskin... Maybe\nsome Whisper Tomatoes too.
8	ll1	If we can just manage to collect those,\nthe rest shouldn't be too hard...
9		
10	1	You can leave getting the ingredients to us.\nWe'll get them to you in time.
11	ll1	That'll be a really great help. I'll take\ncare of the rest of the prep, then.
12	ll1	Let me know when you've got\neverything together, please.
13	ll1	Perfume Herbs, and Thinskin...
14	ll1	...and also Whisper Tomatoes.\nThat's what I need.
evt/nq/msg_nq311313t.json
0		You hand over the ingredients.
1	ll1	Thank you! I should have enough\ntime to get everything ready now.
2	ll1	Would you mind getting the message\nthrough to Travis for me? I've still got\na bit more prep work to take care of.
3	5	No worries! Do what you\ngotta do, Homecomer!
evt/nq/msg_nq311314f.json
0	tk1	OK... Looks like the Homecomers are\nmoving ahead nicely with their prep.
1	tk1	Then everything's in place!
2	tk1	We'll go ahead with the rite tomorrow!\nI'll send out notices to all residents.
3	5	Uh...huh?! Why's it gotta be so sudden?!
4	tk1	The war situation can change in the blink\nof an eye, you know. We gotta go for it\nwhile the going's good.
5	tk1	You OK with that? You'd better be!\nSee you tomorrow morning in front\nof the Founders' statues!
6	tk1	I've found you space in the dormitory\ntonight, so you best go rest up.
7	2	Thank you for that! But really, you\ndidn't need to go to those lengths...
8	3	He's just trying to make sure we're\non time properly tomorrow, yeah?
9	3	'K, bye!
10	tk1	Whoa, not so fast! I thought I told you\nto go rest up in the dormitory?
11	tk1	I know you're gonna be too excited to fall\nasleep right away, but trust me, you're\ngonna need to get some sleep tonight!
12	5	Hey, man. You're the one who's looking\nall wound up and excited.
13	tk1	You think you're just gonna sail right\nthrough this because of your youth, don't\nyou? Don't discount the wisdom of age!
14	tk1	...Look, c'mon, I sent a comm through\nto the dormitory already. Don't make me\nlook bad, would you...?
15	3	A-all right already, sparks...
16	5	...Snuff me...
17	5	Travis is a real worrywart, isn't he?
18	3	Give him a break. It's just because it's\nsuch an important event.
19	6	You need a bit of stress to get things\ndone sometimes, maybe.
20	1	A Homecoming with no off-seeing...
21	2	Are you excited about it?
22	1	Just a little.
23	2	Me too!
24	2	It's hard for me to put into words, but...
25	2	...I really feel like this ties in neatly\nwith our aims, too.
26	1	...Yeah, I think so too.
27	1	Let's rest for today though, to\nbe prepared for tomorrow's rite.
28	2	Yeah, you're right.
evt/nq/msg_nq311315f.json
0	Zl1	Looks like that's everyone.
1	Zl1	Travis... Are we good?
2	tk1	Now we're all set to begin the\nHomecoming ceremony! Let's go!
3	D	...And that's it for our six Homecomers.
4	D	Congratulations!
5	tk1	I'm sure it's a matter of much regret and\nnone of you are looking forward to it, but\nthe final part of the ceremony is next.
6	tk1	Please reconvene at the meeting point,\nand the Homecomers will present their\nofferings of thanks!
7	tk1	That is all! Get your eatin' irons\nready for the banquet!
8	ll1	All right... Just got to focus for\na little bit longer...
9	ml1	You really put a lot of work into this, huh?
10	ll1	Sure did.
11	ll1	When you become an adult, people are\ngoing to demand a lot more from you.
12	ll1	I'll get it done, guaranteed!
13	ll1	I'll make sure I do everything I can\nto keep everyone safe!
14	ml1	...You say that, but how much are\nyou willing to put on the line here?
15	ll1	How much?
16	2	Nice job out there.
17	5	You really did yourselves proud,\nHomecomers!
18	ll1	Thank you!
19	ll1	I hope you're all looking forward to what's\ncoming next, too!
20	ml1	...I hope they realize their new\nresponsibilities will not be\nlimited to victory in battle.
21	ml1	They'll need to leave some offspring\nbehind, so that the next generation\nhas some link to this time...
22	ml1	That goes for me too. I need to consider\nif I can keep fighting at the front line like\nI am now.
23	ml1	I mean...what's the alternative...?
24	ll1	It's time I was leaving...
25	ll1	...Uh, Miyori... Are you all right?
26	ml1	I'm sorry... It's nothing.
27	ml1	I was just thinking...I need to produce\nsome results of my own, too.
28	ml1	We need to take care of some things,\nso we'd better go. We'll be waiting at\nMichiba Canteen.
29	1	OK, we'll see you there.
evt/nq/msg_nq311316f.json

1	ll1	Please, this way!
2	Wn1	C'mon! Roll up!
3	D	You should go and take a look!\nI'm just going to head over there\nand get a drink, all right?
4	1	All right.
5	9	It really look tasty to the max!
6		
7		
8	2	Did you make all of this yourself?
9	Wn1	It's a sight to behold, isn't it?
10	Xn1	This has gotta be the best spread we've\nhad here in years!
11	ml1	Hey, so... Here's why I called you over.\nThere's something we want to give you.
12	2	This...? But this is what\nthe Homecomers got...?
13	ll1	This key is for all of you.
14	2	Huh?
15	ll1	Ah, sorry, time was tight so we\ndidn't manage to get copies made...
16	ll1	But the room itself is all arranged.\nI got Travis and Monica to pull some\nstrings for you.
17	Wn1	You wouldn't believe how much work\nit was. Had to get someone to co-sign,\npick a room, sort out the linens...
18	1	Whoa, is that what kept you so busy\nright up until the last moment...?
19	3	I really appreciate this, but...\nwe aren't City folk...
20	2	Yeah... And when we turn "twenty"...
21	ll1	...Yeah, we know that. We understand.
22	ll1	That's why we thought you should get\nto celebrate it in advance. C'mon, just\ntake it. Don't make me beg.
23	ml1	It was so kind of you to hold a celebration\nfor the Homecomers here.
24	ml1	So let us celebrate you as well. You'll\nbe Homecomers too one day, after all.
25	ll1	I'm speaking on behalf of every single\nperson in the City when I say that.
26	2	Everyone in the City...?
27		You got the Homecomers' Key.
28	ll1	We hope to be with you at your\nHomecoming when the time comes.\nThis will serve as a token of that promise.
29	ll1	So yeah... Let's win this war that\nwe're fighting to make it happen.
30	2	...We'll do it.
31	2	We'll win it, and live out what\nremains of our lives together,\nwith all of you here...
32	D	Well, that was clumsy. You could\nhave just thanked them directly.
33	Zl1	...All I did is what the Homecomers\nasked, that's all. Don't read too much\ninto it, would ya kindly?
34	tk1	But, it's a bit of surprise, to be frank.
35	tk1	Without your cooperation, this ceremony\nwouldn't have gone ahead.
36	Zl1	I know. You don't have to\ntreat me like a fool.
37	Zl1	Are there really people out there\nwho don't want kids growing up...?
38	D	Baffling, right? Anyone should want\nthem all to grow into themselves and\nlive a healthy life.
39	D	Everyone should think so, regardless of\ntheir rank, regardless of their beliefs.
40	Zl1	Ah, this is all making me uncomfortable.\nBeing in agreement with the Elder, that is...
41	D	Really? For me, it's no big deal at all.
42	D	Garrett, you always cover my blind spots\nfor me. I appreciate it.
43	D	It's something I rely on...\nFor all your other faults, I mean.
44	Zl1	I suppose being mouthy\nis a young girl's right...
45	il1	Hey. Maybe you'll hear it better if\nit doesn't come from a young girl.
46	il1	Playne. Give it to him straight.
47	hl1	Chief... Is it possible you've\nhad one too many?
48	il1	Ohhhh, lookit you, gabby upstart!\nThink you're better than me, is that it?!
49	tk1	Uhm, I think the kid's got a point,\nactually...
50	hl1	Sorry, everyone... Mum's always\nlike this, you don't notice she's drunk\nuntil it's too late...
51	il1	Ohhh! You wanna go, do ya?!\nJust say it, go on!
52	tk1	I'm just going to...step back and\nget some water, OK?
53	Zl1	Ah, well I never...
54	D	We all gotta work together to make a future\nfor those who'll come after us. And I mean\nus two working together when I say that.
55	Zl1	...Fine. But just don't start thinking you'll\nbe getting any preferential treatment\nfrom me, ya got that?
56	D	Heh, wouldn't dream of it.

0	2	I wonder if the City folk and the\nColony 15 people are getting along\nOK...
1	5	I mean, none of them are bad guys,\nor anything like that. But people can\nbe surprisingly dumb, huh?
2	3	Well, we haven't got word of any major\nsnuff-ups yet. Maybe they're managing\nto rub along together, somehow?
3	4	Certainly, if they don't manage, it'll\nbe a significant problem.
4	1	We could take a look ourselves and see\nhow it's going? Might be better than just\nstewing about it.
5	1	If it's all fine, then great. If there\nare problems, maybe we can lend\na hand and set things straight.

6	kl1	Uhm... But I can see you...
7	5	They don't seem to be gelling all\nthat well right now, huh...?
8	1	But is it really so bad we need to worry\nabout it? This kind of thing will probably\nwork itself out without us meddling.

6	4	He's got a pretty horrible face\non him, that's for sure. But his\ncharacter is perfectly pleasant.
7	5	In other words, nothing much\nto worry about, again?
8	in1	What? But Shiner is a scion of one of\nthe Six Houses! You must go and help\nhim this very instant!
9	in1	I heard him saying something about going\nto Daedal Isle... Said they wouldn't be\nbothered if they went there.
10	in1	If anything were to befall Shiner...
11	5	Yeah, yeah, we got it. Time for us\nto do a good deed at last. OK, let's\ngo bring Shiner back then!
12	1	I guess we'd better start at Daedal Isle!
evt/nq/msg_nq320105t.json
0	in1	I think you'll find that guy with the\nweird bandana out at Daedal Isle.
1	in1	I'm worried sick about Shiner,\nso please take care of it as\nswiftly as you possibly can!
evt/nq/msg_nq320106f.json
0	qf1	Those swings are getting even smaller...\nC'mon, one more try.
1	wk1	Hurgh!
2	5	What are you guys doing\nall the way out here?
3	qf1	Ah! It's you lot!
4	qf1	Surely it's obvious what\nwe're doing. I'm offering\nShiner here a bit of training.
5	6	Well, it whatever it is, you\nseem to be doing fine here.
6	5	Somehow, you've still managed\nto cause a ruckus though. That's\npretty good going, mate.
7	1	Why'd you go to all the trouble\nof getting out of the City?
8	wk1	Actually...that was my idea. I\nwanted to keep it secret from\nmy dad that I was training.
9	qf1	He just wanted it to be a\nsurprise. Upping the fun!
10	3	Well, that old lady you scared with your\nugly mug back in the City? She was so\nworried, she sent us out to rescue you.
11	qf1	What...? Rescue? Who from?\nIs Shiner in danger...?
12	6	From you, dummy! That old\nlady thought you'd snatched\nhim or something.
13	qf1	Sheesh... I can't win!
14	fk1	Hey! It's that mush from Colony 15!
15	qf1	Huh? Me?
16	fk1	Hahahaha! We thought you\nsmelled fishy, you filthy animal!
17	fk1	We got a report that you'd snatched up\none of our ankle biters! We're taking you\nin, mate! Better come quietly!
18	qf1	I...I don't smell fishy!!!
19	4	It seems that allowing Torto to speak\nfor himself often has the effect of only\ndeepening misunderstandings...
20		What will you do?
21		Hand over Torto
22		Protect Torto
23	5	If you're after this big lug,\nyou're welcome to him.
24	wk1	Huh? But he's done nothing wrong!
25	1	If he's done nothing wrong, then there's\nnothing to fear. They'll understand when\nhis story checks out.
26	wk1	But...
27	1	This is just a misunderstanding.\nWe can vouch for Torto's innocence\nhere!
28	wk1	Yeah, there's no problem here,\nguys. Torto was just showing me\na few moves out here and stuff.
29	fk1	Kid. Do us a favor and shut your yap\nwhile the grown-ups handle this, OK?
30	wk1	This has nothing to do with who's\na kid and who's a grown-up!
31	fk1	Actually, it does!\nNow, butt out, or else-
32	qf1	Hey! Don't take it out on Shiner!
33	qf1	It's me you've got the problem\nwith, right? If you wanna go,\nlet's go!
34	qf1	I don't want to be the kind of lame-ass\nwho causes trouble for his friends.
35	wk1	Torto, mate...
36	wk1	This isn't right!
37	wk1	I'll speak to my dad. I can\nget him to help Torto out.
38	2	But, weren't you trying to keep\nthis whole thing under wraps?
39	wk1	Well, yeah, but abandoning a friend...\nThat's something only a lame-ass\nwould do.
40	wk1	Don't you think?
41	1	Let's go and find Playne!
42	wk1	Yeah!
evt/nq/msg_nq320107f.json
0	wk1	Dad!
1	hl1	Shiner! You've managed to create\na whirlwind of fuss back here, you\nknow that?
2	1	Actually, we came to\ntalk to you about that...
3	hl1	I see. I bet those blasted\nconservatives had something\nto do with it.
4	hl1	They were dead-set against bringing in the\nColony 15 people. Any chance they get to\npoint the finger, they take it.
5	wk1	Dad, please! Can you do\nanything to help Torto out?
6	hl1	Yeah, of course I can.\nBut...
7	hl1	...I haven't even received a\nreport that he's been taken\nin yet.
8	5	Weird. You'd have thought they'd\nget back to the City way before\nus lot.
9	hl1	They're probably planning to work\nthemselves up a nice, neat, tidy little story\nbefore they make it public, I'll wager.
10	hl1	I'm not going to let them do that, though.
11	hl1	We'd better get out there and gather\nup some hard evidence.
12	hl1	Come find me in front of Garrett's\nplace, and we'll get stuck right in.
13	hl1	I've a pretty strong hunch\nthat's where they've got Torto.
14	2	What makes you think that?
15	hl1	Let's just say I got word from\none of my old collaborators, OK?
16	1	OK! Well, we know where to go.\nWe'll be waiting for you there.
17	wk1	I'm coming too!
18	hl1	No, I don't think so, boyo.\nYou're the heir to House Ortiz after all.
19	hl1	You're going to be fighting battles, at my\nside. Battles that only the Six Houses\ncan fight. Got it?
20	wk1	...Yeah. I got it!
21	hl1	OK, guys. You good with this?
22	5	Yeah. We got it!
evt/nq/msg_nq320108t.json
0	hl1	Garrett's domicile is under conservative\nmanagement.
1	hl1	Careful you don't cause any kind of\nfuss until after we've rendezvoused, OK?
evt/nq/msg_nq320109f.json
0	rf1	So, Torto's here, right? Pergas\nsaw them dragging him off!
1	sf1	...!
2	fk1	Shut your traps\nand go home!
3	3	What are they doing here...?
4	fk1	Leave us alone, will ya?
5	rf1	You wanna do this by force?\nCool, that suits us just fine!
6	5	Oi, looks like things are about to turn\nviolent! Noah, what should we do?
7	1	I don't think we have a choice.\nThe stake-out is over... We have to\nstop this.
evt/nq/msg_nq320110f.json
0	hl1	What's going on...?
1	hl1	What are you doing?\nI need you to explain...now!
2	1	S-sorry...we... I guess we just\ngot carried away...
3	hl1	I'm the one that's supposed to be\nhandling getting Torto back!
4	hl1	What was the meaning of this?
5	6	We're sorry...so sorry!
6	qf1	Huh? What's up?
7	wk1	We all came for you, Torto!
8	qf1	Ah, well, sorry to keep my\nfans waiting! Seems I'm a\npopular guy!
9	qf1	I hope it's OK, but I'd really like to\ncarry on training Shiner, if it's all right.
10	2	Yeah? Well, just make sure you don't\ngive rise to any more misunderstandings\nlike this, will you?
11	wk1	Got it!
12	wk1	Torto... I made my mind up about\nsomething. Being strong isn't\nenough, by itself...
13	wk1	I want to become someone who can\nrescue their friends...even if I have to\ndo it by myself!
14	qf1	Oh! That's a pretty cool\naim to have, Shiner!
15	2	It's starting to look like the Colony 15\nguys have what it takes to get along\nwith the City folk, don't you think?
16	6	Yeah, I think so too!
17	5	And I think we found a lookout of our\nown that we can rely on, huh?
18	hl1	The conservatives really went too far this\ntime. Maybe now they've hit rock bottom,\nwe can draw a line under this.
19	hl1	But...I think you guys and I should talk it\nthrough, and make sure something like this\ndoesn't happen again, all right?
evt/nq/msg_nq320300s.json
0	5	Looks like the Colony 15 lot\nare pretty much gone from the\nCity now.
1	3	Oh yeah, haven't seen their\nmugs around for a while.
2	5	So where did they go?
3	6	Do you have any idea\nabout that, Triton?
4	N	Arrrr! Funny ye should ask...
5	N	...Because I haven't a clue! I'm not\ntheir da...or even their ma.
6	N	And what's more, I can't even enter\nthe City without ye whippersnappers\nat my side!
7	6	OK, sure. But aren't you\nat least a bit worried?
8	N	Nah...those young 'uns are free\nnow, to chart their own course\non the high seas.
9	N	Arrr, that's the best you can hope\nfor, living out your own life. Even\nif you end up dyin' in the drink.
10	1	But, if they get themselves in a fix,\nyou've got to go out and help them,\nright? Surely, you'd do that!
11	N	Arrr, that I won't deny.
12	4	...
13	4	Well, anyhow. Let's head over\nto Michiba Canteen.
14	4	If they worked there, even for\na short time, she should have\nan idea of how they're getting on.
15	2	Yeah, let's go!
evt/nq/msg_nq320301f.json
0	N	Arrr, it's Api! You fluffy little ball\nof bilge-soaked oakum!
1	of1	Captain! Big surprise,\nsee you in City!
2	6	And we're here, too!
3	of1	Oh... Oh-ho... Yes.
4	1	Api, it seems that the Colony 15 lot have\nleft the City. Any idea where they went?
5	of1	To say exactly, Colony 15 not\nquite fully went anywhere yet.\nBecause they only just go!
6	N	What in the ocean's depths\nare you saying, fluffbag?
7	of1	If friends want more detail than Api have,\nrecommend to go to Sentridge Harbor and\npick brains of friend called Miyori.
8	of1	Oh, Api so very busy at moment! Have to\ndo not just own work but work of Kio and\nLhukavu right now!
9	pl1	Hey, Nopon newbie! Can we get\nfive Acqua Pazza à la City out\nhere, pronto!
10	of1	Yes yes! Meh!
11	5	She really is busting a gut here.
12	6	Is Miyori the one that helped us out\nwith the ether cylinders that time?
13	3	Well, only way to find out is\nhead down there, I guess.\nLet's go to Sentridge Harbor!
evt/nq/msg_nq320302f.json
0	1	Miyori, is it OK if we ask\nyou about something?
1	ml1	Oh! The Ouroboros! And you\nmust be this Triton character\nI've heard about!
2	N	People are yakkin' about me...?\nThat shivers me timbers, I don't\nmind saying.
3	6	I'm not so sure they're saying\nanything good about you...
4	1	Miyori, have you seen Torto and\nthe others from Colony 15 lately?\nPlease, tell us if you have.
5	ml1	Did I see them? Yeah.\nWe've got them out on\nsome duties right now.
6	N	Duties...? What kind o' duties?
7	ml1	We kind of drafted them into the\nLost Numbers. They're helping us\nout with a few things.
8	ml1	It was thanks to that lot that\nthe exploration of Daedal Isle\nprogressed so well.
9	ml1	Then after that, they did some\ngreat work on Krezen Cliffs.
10	3	Yeah? I would never have expected that!
11	4	Very interesting...\nHard to credit, even.
12	ml1	You didn't know?
13	N	Not the slightest inkling.
14	N	They didn't give so much as a\nby-your-leave to me. And I'm the\none meant to be keepin' em safe!
15	5	Ah, don't think too\nmuch on it, old man.
16	6	But, you didn't sound all that concerned\nwhen we asked you about it before, Triton.\nYou said they should take their own risks.
17	N	...Arr... Perhaps I had a bit too much\nwind in me sails when I said that.
18	1	So...where are they now?
19	ml1	We sent them over to the Cay of the\nTrick Grotto. They're salvaging some\npretty important stuff over there.
20	1	OK. Thanks a lot!
21	2	Triton, you don't seem all that keen on\ngoing, but will you come along anyway?
22	4	Yes, we'd better see what's\ngoing on over there.
evt/nq/msg_nq320303f.json
0	N	Arrrr, there you are, you\nwayward scurvy dogs!
1	qf1	Captain!
2	rf1	What brings you out here?
3	6	We were just curious about all this\ngraft you're doing on behalf of the\nLost Numbers!
4	N	'Course, I know what you little sea-squirts\nget up to is your own business, but the\nOuroboros crew here insisted.
5	pf1	Ah, that's our Cap'n!
6	4	So you're accepting Lost Numbers\nduties now?
7	qf1	Yeah, that's right.
8	vf1	We're way tougher than anyone in\nthe City. So we're making a real\ngood job of it out here!
9	N	And I'm way tougher than any of you\npipsqueaks! Don't be forgettin' that now!
10	vf1	Right now, we've been asked to gather\nup stuff like this from the island.
11	pf1	Indications point to it being hidden\naround here somewhere, you see!
12	N	Arrr, now you're speaking my language...\nQuesting for booty!
13	N	Now, listen to the Cap'n. The north\nwind just blew a mighty good idea\nright into me earholes.
14	N	How about us lot and you youngers face\noff in another hunt for booty! See who's\nable to reel it in the fastest!
15	5	...What...again?
16	uf1	Nah. Not for me.
17	N	Arrr... Turning down a booty challenge?\nYou've no craic at all, have you?
18	5	C'mon, maybe they've\njust got a bit old...
19	qf1	Captain, if you're up for it, then you and\nyour crew could take this island. We can\ncheck out some leads elsewhere.
20	rf1	Hey, Torto. Are you sure\nthat's going to be OK?
21	qf1	Yeah, I mean, we'll get done faster\nif we split it up like this, right?
22	vf1	Yeah, I think Torto has the right idea.\nLet's head out!
23	rf1	Roger!
24	qf1	Captain, if we manage to get ahold\nof the booty, then let's rendezvous\nat Sentridge Harbor, OK?
25	3	Great. Looks like Triton's roped\nus all in for some treasure hunting.\nA.k.a. hard graft!
26	N	Arrr... Don't make a face like that, girl.
27	5	Well? We'd better get on with it then.\nAnother thrilling booty hunt.
28	N	Arrr, that's the spirit that'll\ncarry you through, lad!
evt/nq/msg_nq320304f.json
0	1	Well, no sign of what we've been\nlooking for, so far...
1	N	Not at all, we picked the right\nspot here, bet your barnacles!
2	N	What's that...? I'm getting an unseemly\nwhiff of booty on the east wind there...\nBooty...and Nopon.
3	N	I daresay they've stuffed a container\nfull o' treasure and buried it!
4	N	Look around here...\nSee anything that's\nshiverin' ya timbers?
5	6	This patch of ground\nlooks totally normal...
6	N	Land-ho! Look here!
7	3	It's a shot in the dark, but whatever.
8	N	It's here, and no mistakin'...\nI can feel it in me Jolly Rogers...
9	N	O' course, if you thought about it rationally,\nyou'd think they'd stowed it somewhere easy\nto remember, like a cliff edge or under a tree.
10	N	Arrr! This is Nopon booty we're lookin'\nfor, here! Those crafty little barnacles will\nhave put it somewhere weird, to be sure!
11	4	Right in the cave's entrance...\nIs that weird enough?
12	N	Thought they'd get the better of a salty\nold sea-dog like me, did they? Well, let's\ntry digging right here then!
13	5	Here it is!
14	N	Haharrr! I bet you're ruing doubtin'\nyour elder now, aren't ye?
15	5	Yeah. Just a little bit, though.
16	1	OK. Shall we take this stuff back then?
17	6	The Colony 15 guys are\nprobably waiting for us\nover at Sentridge Harbor.
evt/nq/msg_nq320305f.json
0	ml1	Welcome back.\nDid you find them OK?
1	3	Yeah, we found 'em. Not only that,\nwe got roped into doing their work\nfor them. Result!
2	3	Check this out!
3	ml1	You guys brought this back, did you?
4	ml1	Cool. How about the Colony 15 crew?
5	6	They said they had some leads on another\nisland, so they went to check it out.
6	ml1	Right. I guess they were just trying to\nget the stuff they said they'd get as\nquickly as possible then.
7	qf1	Sorry to keep you waiting there!\nUnfortunately, the search was a\nbit more difficult than we'd thought.
8	vf1	That's seven bits we\nbrought back this time.
9	pf1	How many did you get, Cap'n?
10	N	Me? Seven.
11	qf1	OK... So if we put them all together with\nthe ones from before, then we have...
12	pf1	Whoa...19?!
13	vf1	Nah... More than 20, surely?
14	ml1	It's more.
15	uf1	What the...?!
16	rf1	Yeah!
17	6	You seem over the moon!\nUm, why is that?
18	ml1	We'll take 20 of these, and present\nthem to the Lost Numbers.
19	pf1	If we do that, maybe the Cap'n will\nget permission to come and go in the\nCity even without the Ouroboros!
20	ml1	Yeah, that was the deal.
21	vf1	Yeah, that's the deal we managed\nto beg from Monica, the scary old\nlady and the grumpy old dude!
22	N	You mean...
23	qf1	Triton... To borrow a City word, we're\nfamily now. We're the Triton family!
24	vf1	Well, I mean, in the City, a family\nis something that stays together, right?
25	uf1	We can't have you living off\nin a whole other place, Cap'n!
26	N	...Arrrr...
27	N	Aye, I suppose ye're right.\nAnd I have a family!
28	tf1	Yeah! The Triton family!\nHas a nice ring to it!
29	N	Well me hearties, let's sup\nsome grog to seal the deal!
30	N	It'll be Api's treat over at\nMichiba Canteen! We're family\nnow...so eat your fill!
31	qf1	Yeah!
32	5	Ah, Triton's looking so happy right now...
33	ml1	They're a decent bunch, aren't they?
34	ml1	I'm sure they're going to get along\njust fine with the Lost Numbers.\nAnd the City folk too!
evt/nq/msg_nq320400f.json
0	N	Arrr, time to rest our bones\nfor a moment, don't you think?
1	5	Huh?
2	N	Don't mind if I do.
3	ql1	Ah, you're here to get in my way\nagain, you big lump?
4	N	C'mon old timer!\nNo need to chide\nme like that.
5	ql1	Relax! Of course I don't really mind\nif the likes of you turn up and\nmake the place a bit livelier!
6	1	Do you know each other?
7	N	As it happens, Jaggar and I are\nold mateys, aren't we, old timer?
8	ql1	Yeah, Triton buddied up with this old,\noutcast reprobate of the City. He calls\nme "old timer"!
9	N	Haharr! Aye, me an' the old timer\nhere get along like two pearls\nin a mermaid's purse!
10	N	We're like sails cut from the same cloth,\nand no mistake! Now an' again, we put\nthree sheets to the wind, like this. Cheers!
11	3	Whoa! You've got friends that I never\nwould have guessed.
12	ql1	What brings you here, anyway?\nYou're a little young to be\ndrinkin' any of the hard stuff.
13	N	I think they came by to see if we\nhad any war stories to tell 'em,\nold timer! Or maybe a sea shanty.
14	ql1	My tales are too boring\nfor a drinking session!
15	ql1	For example, that Nopon that\nI've taken in? Does nothing but\nmuck about. No use whatsoever!
16	N	Arrr, cheer up, old timer! At your\nage, every extra day is a blessing!
17	ql1	Haha! Sometimes wisdom finds its\nway out of that big mouth of yours!
18	ql1	Speaking of good days, that miso that\nyou gave me really hit the spot!
19	5	Huh, so you've been handing\nout miso to people, is that right,\nTriton?
20	N	Aye, it makes a great sidekick\nto a stiff drink, so it does!
21	ql1	You know, my granddad had a real touch\nwhen it came to making miso... I still\nremember the taste of miso, even now.
22	N	A worthy hobby indeed,\nfor an old timer's granddad!
23	ql1	One day, my granddad said that he was\nheading out to search for good produce\nto go with miso...and never came back.
24	ql1	Where he finally fell, no one knows.
25	3	Did you ever get out of\nthe City yourself, Jaggar?
26	ql1	Looking at my bony ol' meat sack today,\nit's hard to imagine, but I used to be\npretty brawny back in the day.
27	ql1	There was a certain crazy woman who\ntook my fancy back then... And I fell in\nwith an old guy who loved spas...
28	ql1	Those two were pretty friendly with\neach other - so friendly in fact, that\nthey almost got married.
29	4	Hang on... What are we talking\nabout here precisely?
30	ql1	...But, in the end, that marriage never\ncame to be. Huh, what am I talking\nabout, you say?
31	N	I think ye've been blown off course a bit\nthere, me old matey. You started off talking\nabout side dishes for a drinking party!
32	5	Nah, that's not what he meant!
33	ql1	Side dishes, eh...? Oh yes! I was\ntalking about remembering eating\nthat miso way back, wasn't I?
34	ql1	There was a certain fruit that my\ngranddad used to procure from\nsomewhere or other... It was delicious.
35	N	Arrr, this is some interesting stuff\nyou're letting us in on, old timer!
36	ql1	Oh, the flavor was something special,\nsomething rare... It was legendary fruit!
37	ql1	I was only a kid when I had it... Oh, I\ncannot describe it! It was like a universe\nof taste opening up in your mouth!
38	ql1	Ah, I'd love to taste it once more,\nbefore I take my dirt nap...
39	ql1	I'm sorry, I'll stop with these old\ngeezer stories, and just drink.
40	N	Wait, old timer!
41	ql1	Huh?
42	N	If it means so much to ye,\nthen we'll go out and find ye some!
43	2	Wh-what?
44	N	Aye, we're all just itching to hear\nabout the legend of this fruit here!\nAren't we?
45	4	I won't disagree with our\nseafaring friend.
46	N	Maybe it's not typical drinking-story\nfare, but tell us the legend of the\ntasty fruit, will you, old timer?
47	ql1	Looks like you young 'uns have really\ngotten a taste for this old timer's story\nhere! Haha!
48	N	Aye, tell ye the truth, we're all suckers\nfor that kind o' thing. You just wait,\nold timer. We'll bring it back for you!
49	ql1	I can wait as long as it takes! If I've got\na bite of that fruit coming my way, I can\nwait till the end of time!
50	N	All right, ye land-lubbers!\nlet's raise anchor and set sail!
51	1	It's all very well saying "let's go", but\nare we really going to find it if we\ndon't have the first clue where to look?
52	2	Manana, have you got any idea?
53	9	Remember fruit of Bright Fig,\nfound in Maktha Wildwood?
54	3	Ah, that...
55	3	But...we don't know if\nit's edible yet, right?
56	2	Well, I guess we could go there and\ntake a look. It's a good place to start.
57	N	Sounds like we've charted a course!\nLet's raise anchor and claim our\nfruity booty!
58	ql1	What...? You lot aren't drinking!
evt/nq/msg_nq320401t.json
0	ql1	I can't give you anything to\ndrink, sorry! You're just too\nyoung!
1	ql1	Anyway, the thing about booze, is that\nthe older you get, the better it tastes.
2	ql1	But anyway, about that legendary fruit.\nIt has to ripen for a long time to get the\nreal sweetness. Years, in fact.
3	ql1	Perhaps it's the same for people!\nSometimes I feel like I'm in the\nprime of my life now.

2	N	But is this the one the old timer was after?\nScarcely holds a candle to the Death Lychee\nI saw, once upon a time.
3	9	Meh! In any cases, fruit not ripe yet.\nIf eat now, drop dead is possible.
4	N	Arrrr, is that right?\nBut it looks tasty enough.\nCalling out like a siren...
5	2	It's a good thing we had Manana with\nus to put us straight on that, right?
6	9	Yes, this is tricky aspect of legendary\nfruit. Not many know difference between\nripe and unripe, so not many eat!
7	N	I'm sure my stomach'd make light work\nof it. But I daresay the old timer would\nbe wiped out on the spot.
8	3	Hey, don't say stuff like that...\nIt's bad luck!
9	6	So what should we do? We can't really\ntake this back. Doesn't look there are any\nothers round here, either.
10	N	So, Manana... Maybe ye've\ngot an idea, since you're such\na furry little expert...
11	9	Meh-meh! Best idea simply wait\nfor period of one year for ripen!
12	9	Fruit is already in place difficult\nfor people or monsters to eat.
13	9	Flavor, not only safety, another good\nreason to not eat before proper time.\nSuch sweetness!
14	4	It's somewhere hard to find, then...?\nIf we're talking locally, the lower levels\ncould be suitably out of the way.
15	2	Plenty of monsters around, though.
16	9	It possible that Bright Fig has been\nprotected by smarty-monsters who\nknow it not ready for good eating!
17	N	Aye? Well, perhaps we should\ngo and have a look?
18	5	You did hear the part about there\nbeing loads of monsters, right, mate?
19	N	Monsters? Leave 'em to me.\nI'll blast 'em off to the middle\ndistance!
evt/nq/msg_nq320403f.json
0	N	Shiver me timbers... It's...
1	9	Meh...! That...
2	9	...Fruit ripened to perfection!
3	2	Really?
4	9	Such glossy glaze...fragrance...\nUnmistakable sign of ripeness!
5	1	I guess most people wouldn't be able\nto make it to this place to get the fruit.\nNo regular people, anyway.
6	4	Perhaps "legendary" was not an\nexaggeration in this case.
7	N	Well, better get it back to the\nold timer's piehole then, so he\ncan die happy!
8	3	You've really busted a gut just to put\na smile on that old man's face.\nHe's gonna love you for it!
9	N	Arrr, I hope so. Folks in the City have\nbeen keeping me at arm's length,\nbecause of what and who I am.
10	N	Not that old timer though! He just keeps\npouring me out another drink without\npaying it a bit of mind.
11	N	I'm real grateful for that! So I need\na way to say thanks. That's why I'm\nrisking my neck out here!
12	5	Can't believe there's a tender spot\nin your salty seadog's heart...
13	N	And thanks to being such a booze-soaked\nol' kipper, I can't remember a thing about\nthe first time we drank together!
14	6	Well, it sounds like it's a really big deal\nto you, Triton. We'd better get it back to\nJaggar so he can enjoy it!
15	N	Yeah, you said it, kid!\nLet's get it back to the City!
evt/nq/msg_nq320404f.json
0	N	Huh? Where'd the old timer get to?
1	1	He's usually always here, right?
2	N	Yeah, usually he's here, morning to night...
3	N	Maybe he had a bit too much one time\nand earned himself a ban...?\nI don't know where he lives, either...
4	yk1	Meh? Triton...?
5	N	What...? What could an ankle-biting\nball o' fluff like ye be wantin' with\nme?
6	yk1	If friend looking for oldipon, then\ngo to Remembrance Stones.\nOldipon sleep there.
7	N	Huh...? He's not... He's alive, right?
8	6	No... I can't believe it...\nHe seemed so healthy...
9	yk1	Sadly, it true. Oldipon keel over\njust after friends leave...
10	N	I see...\nCould you be the Nopon kid\nthat he said he'd adopted...?
11	yk1	Meh! Yes...
12	N	I appreciate you comin' to me to break\nthe bad news. I'll go to pay me respects\nthen.
13	5	You scarcely look as if you've\ntaken it in, Triton... You look\nso calm.
14	N	Well, that's just the way it is.\nDeath comes for everyone.
15	N	Ah, kid... The old timer took you in, looked\nafter you, didn't he? So you owe it to him\nto live a good life now.
16	yk1	Oldipon liked very much to drink\nwith Triton... Say that very often\nto Cubibi. So thank to you, for that.
17	N	I'm sorry to be wearin' out your patience\nlike this, but will ye stick with me just\na little longer?
18	1	Of course... Of course\nwe'll come with you to\nthe Remembrance Stones.
19	N	Aye, ye read it right\nout of my mind...
evt/nq/msg_nq320405t.json
0	yk1	Oldipon sleeping soundly\nat Remembrance Stones.
1	yk1	Since oldipon start to drink\nwith Triton, days were full\nof fun, oldipon say.
evt/nq/msg_nq320406f.json
0	N	Well, here you go, old timer.\nI brought ye your legendary fruit.\nEven if it be a little late...
1	N	Ye said you'd wait till the end of time\nfor this fruit. But I didn't keep ye waiting\nas long as that, did I now, old timer!
2	4	Wait... Is that...enough?
3	N	People die, and when they're\ngone, there's nothin' ye or any\nother can do about it.
4	N	Don't worry old timer, I'll drink\nyour share for ye. I can promise\nye that.
5	5	This just seems a bit...\nI don't know how to put it...
6	N	Ye were the first friend that I made\nin this place, and I'll never forget ye.
7	N	Drinkin' down every lost drop o' your\nproblems till ye've got a gutful...\nThat's how ye move forward through life.
8	N	But some things that pain ye, ye cannot\nforget. And they become the cornerstone\nthat bears up the whole of yer life.
9	3	Triton... You're really bearing up well here.
10	N	Indeed, my lass. That's what's made\nme strong, made me what I am.
11	N	Well, I've taken up a lot of your time.\nI hope I haven't presumed upon too\nmuch of ye.
12	1	No, not all...\nReally, don't mention it.
13	2	I'm sure...that Jaggar would be\nvery happy if he could see this...\nWho knows, maybe he can.
14	N	Aye, perhaps... Or just as likely,\nhe's blind drunk and can't even\nremember my name...
15	N	I suppose I'd better make a nuisance\nof myself here every now and again...\nJust so he doesn't forget! Hahaha!
16	N	Well, I had better take me leave.\nFarewell, old timer, for now.
17	N	...Arrr... What will I do...?
evt/nq/msg_nq330100s.json
0	O	Hey, everyone...\nThere's something I wanted\nto talk to you all about.
1	O	A lot of people in Colony Mu still seem\nworried, even though it's been liberated...
2	O	What can I do to lift everyone's spirits\nagain? Do you have any ideas?
3	4	I'm not surprised they're feeling shaken\nafter a traumatic sequence of events\nlike that...
4	2	What about you, Fiona? Are *you* OK?\nYou're not stressing yourself out, are you?
5	O	I have to be OK. If I look like I'm down,\neveryone else will feel down, too...
6	5	That definitely sounds like stressing\nyourself out to me!
7	5	I know Tallow said this already,\nbut you can tell us anything, 'kay?
8	5	There must be stuff that's too tough to\ndiscuss with people in the colony...
9	1	...I was just going to mention that.
10	1	You still haven't told your colony\nabout the Consul's true identity,\nhave you?
11	O	...I thought it'd be better not to tell them...
12	6	Aw, Fifi...
13	O	Besides, I just want to think about\nthe future from now on.
14	O	I want everyone to feel truly happy\nthat we survived together, or excited\nfor tomorrow...
15	O	I want to bring those feelings back\nfor everyone, to make their sadness\ndisappear...
16	5	...Well then, isn't it obvious\nwhat you need to do?
17	6	In Colony Mu, everybody works together\nas one. Isn't that what you all say?
18	2	Why don't you try talking to the colony\nabout what to do next, Fifi?
19	O	I'm...not sure how that would pan out...
20	6	We can come with you!\nWould you like that?
21	O	Ah...! Yes, please...!
22	1	We can ask for Tallow's cooperation too,\nsince he knows all about the situation.
23	O	Oh, but one more thing...
24	O	Is it OK...if I call you "Sennie"?
25	6	Who, me? For sure!
26	5	Hey, how come only she gets a nickname?
27	O	You want one too? How about..."Lan-Lan"?
28	5	"Lan-Lan"?!
29	3	That suits you so well, Lan-Lan!
30	1	Guess you're Lan-Lan now.
31	5	You lot really wind me up...
32	2	All right, all right.\nEnough with the nicknames.
33	2	Let's get started - Colony Mu needs us.\nI'm sure Tallow will help us out.
evt/nq/msg_nq330101t.json
0	xf1	...So you want to discuss it with\neveryone? Not just the squad leaders?
1	O	Mhm... I want to handle this properly,\nsince this is such an important issue.
2	xf1	...I see. Yeah, you're right.
3	xf1	OK! Let's get a message out-
4	6	Wait! We might worry everyone\nif we gather them so suddenly!
5	O	Sennie's right. Let's go and invite\nthem one by one, face-to-face. That way\nwe can keep an eye on things, as well.
6	xf1	Oh, sure. In that case, let's split up.\nLet's say we each take four people...
7	xf1	How about we have you speak to\nNico, Lotus, Tussore and Googoo?
8	6	Gotcha!
9	xf1	I'll send everyone's locations to your Iris.\nThen let's meet up in the square!
10	O	Got it. Thank you, Tallow.
11	xf1	Oh, please, I barely did anything.\nThank you for coming to me for help!
12	xf1	If you ask me, the tastiest cut\nof fish around here has to be\nthe Rich Serprond Collar-Cut.
13	xf1	It's a cut you'll find on a massive, rare fish\nknown as a Delicious Serprond, and when\nI say rare, I *really* mean rare.
14	xf1	If we somehow got our hands on that,\nI bet everyone would be pleased as punch.

0	Zg1	We're meeting at the square?\nGot it! I'll see you there!

2	bg1	Well, all right then. I wonder what\nthis is all about. I'll see you there!
3	bg1	What the spark? Where is everyone?
4	bg1	Well, that's fine. I'll carry on thinkin' up\ntoday's menu, then!
5	bg1	Heh heh heh. Wanna know a secret?\nI actually have the perfect menu right\nup my sleeve! Just came up with it!

1	O	I'm sorry for the short notice. I know you\nall must be a little on edge right now.
2	O	That's actually what I want to talk about.\nI've been wondering how to raise morale\naround here. Does anyone have any ideas?
3	Zg1	I don't really mind. I'm happy to just\nfollow your instructions!
4	Xg1	It's easy to overthink things when you\nget so much free time so suddenly...
5	O	You just want my instructions...?
6	xf1	Any other ideas? Come on. Anybody?
7	xf1	...You've got nothing? Really?!
8	@f1	Let's see... Well, Nico, a.k.a. me, wants to\nget us some more provisions!
9	xf1	And that's why you're in charge of the\nwarehouse! Always looking for more food.
10	@f1	Come to think of it, didn't the Consul use\nto do that for us before?
11	@f1	Now we have to take care of that stuff all\nby ourselves, probably...
12	zf1	...Oh, the Consul... (sniffle)
13	@f1	...H-huh?! Hildie, please don't cry!
14	Yg1	It's all right, Hildemarie. The worst is over.\nThere's nothing to be scared of any more.
15	_f1	How about we help Nico out and make\ntoday's dinner a magnificent feast?
16	zf1	Oh...! Can we?
17	ag1	That sound great! Let's do!\nGoogoo feel raring to go!
18	bg1	You're so cute when you're excited, Goo...!
19	O	Sounds like we're all gathering food, then.
20	O	Bring it back here if you find anything!
21	Wg1	Got it.
22	bg1	Let's do this!
23	xf1	Hey, we didn't decide who's doing what...!\nWell, I guess it doesn't matter...
24	6	I wanna gather some ingredients that the\nothers might not be able to find.
25	3	You want a bit of a challenge, you mean?\nI'm game, innit!
26	O	How about we catch some fish?
27	O	There's some absolutely great fishing to be\nfound around Migrow's Rosary.
28	6	Yeah! Let's get a whole bunch and knock\neveryone's socks off!
evt/nq/msg_nq330107f.json

1	O	Thanks, Hildie-kins. You've got a good eye!
2	zf1	Heeheehee...
3	Wg1	So now what? Who's going first?
4	xf1	Why don't we just go together? I don't\nwanna get stressed out...
5	Wg1	That's our Tirky-Tallow.
6	xf1	No "Tirkinhead" this time? You're just full\nof these Tirkin-related digs, aren't you?
7	@f1	Wanna give us our cue, Fifi?
8	O	OK, sure. Ready, everyone?
9	O	Let's go!
10		108 pieces of Aromatic Krodlax\nMeat have been collected.
11		89 Top-Quality Moglum Livers\nhave been collected.
12		3 Rich Serprond Collar-Cuts\nhave been collected.
13	xf1	...I can't believe everyone's gone fishing!
14	5	Now that's a funny coincidence...
15	ag1	Everyone love fish so much...\nPeople here truly people of Googoo!
16	O	This is exactly the kind of thing that could\nlift everyone's spirits!
17	Zg1	Everyone had the same idea. Amazing!
18	O	I know! I can't believe it!
19	bg1	I guess today's dinner is gonna\nbe a total fish-jamboree!
20	zf1	We're having a jamboree?!
21	3	Huh? What's a "jamboree"?
22	bg1	It's when everyone eats some tasty grub\nand has a ton of fun together!
23	O	Irma taught us about it. She always\ntold us to take breaks and have fun\nonce in a while...
24	zf1	Having a jamboree always brings\neveryone closer together!
25	zf1	I simply love them!
26	Wg1	Throwing a party is fine and all...
27	Wg1	...but don't you think we should work on\nbeing a bit more organized before that?
28	xf1	That's why I said we should decide\nwho does what, but you'd already\ngone by then...
29	Wg1	...Huh? What do you mean?
30	xf1	Well, you know you like to follow the beat\nof your own drum sometimes.
31	xf1	You have to make little compromises to\nwork together with everyone sometimes...
32	Wg1	Are you saying that it's my fault?
33	xf1	That's not what I said.
34	Wg1	Yes, you did! You think you're so\nmuch better just because Fiona\ncame to you for help, and-
35	5	Hey, take it easy, you two.\nI think you better leave it there.
36	O	Oh, dear. What's going on...?
37	Wg1	...Nothing. I'm sorry, but I think I'm gonna\neat alone today.
38	@f1	...Hey, that wasn't like you, Tallooloo.
39	xf1	Well, it's all part of the job. Looks like\nI've got my work cut out for me...
40	xf1	Irma's left some pretty big shoes to fill.\nI can't leave them empty...
41	@f1	Tallooloo...?
42	xf1	Don't worry, it won't happen next time!\nI'm sorry for worrying you.
43	5	...Is that lad gonna be OK?
44	6	And what did he mean by "next time"...?
45	O	Hm...

3	Xg1	She said somebody needs to be\non lookout... But then, why didn't\nshe just stay herself, huh?!

evt/nq/msg_nq330155t.json
0	_f1	I think I can kind of guess why you\ncalled us all to the square.
1	_f1	When we face struggles as a colony,\nwe have to overcome them together.
2	_f1	I think that's what Irma would\nsay if she were still here.
evt/nq/msg_nq330200s.json
0	3	Hey, so... We've been hearing talk\naround Colony Mu about Tallow...
1	3	...He doesn't seem very popular, does he?\nThey seem uneasy about him...
2	O	He certainly tries really hard.\nBut opinion is split between\nthose who want to support him...
3	O	...and those who feel anxious and\nquestion why he's the one in charge...
4	1	Opinions on Tallow aside, I'm also\nquite worried about how the colony\nseems to be falling out of harmony.
5	4	...Yes, I would echo Noah's assessment.
6	4	Until now, everyone teamed up under\nyour leadership, just trying to survive...
7	4	...but now they have no single fixed\nobjective, and everything has been thrown\ninto disarray... That's how it seems to me.
8	6	People seem to be quarreling\na lot more, too...
9	O	...And I've been talking to Tallow, too.
10	O	But everyone has their own opinions and\nfeelings on the subject...
11	O	What a mess... Everyone just wants to\nmake the colony a better place, and yet\n*this* is the result...
12	4	If things carry on like this, it might not just\nbe Tallow they start to lose trust in...
13	4	It could be you, too, Fiona.
14	O	I don't mind if people talk badly about me.\nThis all happened because of me, after all.
15	O	But Tallow's just been thinking about what\nhe can do after what happened with Irma...
16	O	He's been trying so, so hard.\nI have to honor those feelings, too...
17	6	...Are you OK, Fiona?\nPlease don't push yourself to breaking...
18	O	You've been giving me such good advice.\nI don't want to squander it...
19	O	So I don't plan on giving in. I want to\novercome this, no matter how hard it gets.
20	5	...In other words, you wanna survive.
21	O	...Yeah.
22	3	What do you wanna do? Shall we gather\neveryone in the square again?
23	O	No, we already tried that... I think this time\nI'll go and talk to everyone myself.
24	2	How about you do it in the canteen?\nYou could probably bring things up\nquite naturally, nobody'll bat an eyelid.
25	O	Ah, yes, the canteen...! Thank you, Mio.
26	2	It may be frustrating, but we'll be right\nthere by your side, ready to support you.
27	2	The colony will get better,\none step at a time.
28	O	OK...! I'll do my best to make that happen!
evt/nq/msg_nq330201f.json
0	xf1	Can I have everyone's attention, please?!?!
1	5	Huh? Tallow...?
2	xf1	Sorry if I caught you mid-mouthful!
3	xf1	Today, Shu and I have a little proposition\nfor you...
4	xf1	...and it's called a "Progress Point Card"!
5	Xg1	And what's that supposed to be...?
6	xf1	Thank you for asking, Mikaela!
7	xf1	Since we don't have to fight any more,\nI'm sure you've all been struggling for\nstuff to do.
8	xf1	That's why we came up with something\nto solve that very problem!
9	xf1	Take a look! This is a "Poi-"...!
10	xf1	..."Point"... "Point Program"...?
11	Yg1	The "Progress Point Card".
12	xf1	Yes, right! That's the one.
13	Xg1	You already forgot the name\nof your own idea...?
14	Yg1	Don't worry. It's simple enough that\neven a Tirkinhead like him can use it.
15	Yg1	If you report to Tallow every time you\ncontribute to the colony, or help someone\nor do whatever like that...
16	Yg1	...he'll give you a point and a sticker\nfor every contribution you make.
17	@f1	And what happens if we get lots of 'em?
18	xf1	Then you'll become the lieutenant!
19	Xg1	Reallyyy?!
20	O	Pardon me?!
21	Wg1	What did you just say?!
22	Wg1	...Wait, Fiona didn't know about\nthis either?!
23	O	Th-this is the first I've heard of it...!
24	xf1	We figured that whoever contributes most\nto the colony is by definition qualified to\nbe the lieutenant.
25	xf1	I thought this could be the best, fairest\nway to pick a lieutenant, and take some\nweight off Fiona at the same time...
26	xf1	I know you've been worrying about stuff\nwith me as your lieutenant, Fiona.\nThis is the least I could do!
27	O	Oh, Tallow...
28	Wg1	But still, this is pretty sudden...
29	Yg1	No need to think too hard about it. You'll\ndo fine. You're always helping everybody\nout around the colony anyway, Ayase.
30	Yg1	You'll just be picking up stickers for it at\nthe same time now.
31	@f1	Stickers, huh? And we stick 'em to that\ncard you've got there?
32	Xg1	I bet it would look cute covered\nin stickers...
33	Yg1	Yeah, we designed it that way. Doesn't it\nmotivate you to cute it up?
34	Wg1	Yeah, it sure does!
35	Xg1	That's our Shu! You know us so well!
36	@f1	It's just like him to do his research...\nResourceful as ever!
37	Xg1	Let's try it, Aya!\nIt sounds like it could be fun.
38	Xg1	Besides, it doesn't seem like it'll be much\ndifferent to what you do already.
39	Yg1	Also, I stayed up all night making\nthese cards, so if you don't use\nthem I'll be proper sad.
40	Wg1	Well, if you all insist.
41	xf1	I've got high hopes for you, Ayase.
42	Wg1	Is that a challenge?
43	@f1	Come on now, play nice!
44	O	Shu... Do you mind if I have a card too?
45	Yg1	Huh? But you're our-
46	O	I want to take part as well.
47	O	You and Tallow worked so hard to\ncome up with this idea, after all.
48	Yg1	...All right. Of course.
49	Yg1	...I'm sorry for not telling you beforehand.
50	Yg1	Tallow was worried about getting you\ntoo involved in it, since the idea was to\nease your workload...
51	O	It's OK, I understand.
52	O	You watch, I'm gonna get a bunch\nof stickers!
53	5	Well, this sure got interesting.
54	O	Sorry, I don't really know\nwhat came over me...
55	6	Don't even worry about it! Collecting\nstickers sounds like a lot of fun to me.
56	5	I'm gonna kick all your arses at this.
57	4	I think the point whistled past Lanz's head.
58	1	So we have to help out around the colony\nand then report it to Tallow, if I recall.
59	1	So anyway, let's see if we can get\nfive stickers or so. How about it?
60	O	Mission accepted!
61	2	I wonder if there's anything we can do\nto help nearby.
evt/nq/msg_nq330202t.json
0	xf1	Looks like you did an excellent job helping\nout! Here's a sticker, just for you.
1	xf1	Just don't forget to put it on your, uh...\nPoint... Something point wossname card.
2	xf1	While we're on the subject, Hildemarie\nseems to be over the moon.
3	xf1	That's one sticker for the report,\nand another one as a little bonus.
4	xf1	Putting a smile on her face is a very\nimportant contribution, too. So thank you!
5	xf1	If you're happy with the amount of\nstickers you have, go on and show\nyour card to Shu.
6	xf1	Keep up the good work!
7	xf1	If you're happy with the amount of\nstickers you have, go on and show\nyour card to Shu.
8	xf1	What's up? I don't think I have any\nstickers for you right now...
9	xf1	Do you wanna quit now?
10		Want to stop collecting stickers?
11		Give up
12	xf1	Ah, really? That's a shame...\nBut it's OK, I'm sure you must\nhave other things to do.
13	xf1	Shu's in charge of the final counts.\nCan I get you to report to him too?
14		Keep going
15	xf1	Now you're talking!\nI can't wait for your next report!
evt/nq/msg_nq330203t.json
0	Yg1	No worries, we've still got a lotta stickers\ngoing spare. Don't be shy, earn yourself\nas many as you can.
1	Yg1	Want to know how I made these stickers?
2	Yg1	...I actually just took some sticky tape\nfrom off a few supply crates, and cut it up\nreally small.
3	Yg1	Had to make quite a number of them,\nso it was actually a good bit of a work...
4	Yg1	Excellent. Good job.\nI'll get the overall scores tallied up now.
5	Yg1	...You think someone lost this? In that case,\njust leave it with us for now.
6	Yg1	We'll make sure it's returned to its rightful\nowner, don't you worry.
7		You hand over the lost item to Shu.
8	Yg1	Can you please wait a little longer until\neveryone else has returned?
evt/nq/msg_nq330204f.json
0	O	We've got enough stickers now!
1	2	I guess we should stick them on now.
2	6	Ooh, can I stick one on as well?!
3	5	Guess I'll stick 'em on this space here?
4	1	I'd assume so. You do it like this, I think...
5	4	...Wait, how did this happen?
6	3	Yeah, *Taion*, why did you\nstick yours next to mine?
7	3	Surely there were other places\nyou could've stuck it on?\nYou didn't have to crowd me!
8	4	But this puts them in the\ncorrect order, see?
9	5	Oh, what? We weren't just\nsticking 'em on wherever?
10	4	Urgh...
11	5	Wh...what did I do now?
12	6	...I like sticking them on this way too!\nIt has a certain, uh, charm...!
13	O	I think so too! It's pretty cute.
14	4	It's not about how it looks, it's about\nfollowing the right pattern in order to-
15	3	Oh relax already. As long as\nthey're all stuck on, right?
16	2	It's great making memories,\ntogether like this...
17	1	Shu's in charge of tallying the results,\nright? Let's report to him, before we forget.
evt/nq/msg_nq330205f.json
0	Xg1	Hey, everyone!\nHow many points did you get?
1	Wg1	I'm pretty confident in my score.
2	@f1	So is Nico! Oh, um, that's me!
3	_f1	I wonder who the next lieutenant\nwill end up being...
4	xf1	Sorry to keep you waiting, folks! Let me\nget right to it and read out the results.
5	xf1	The winner is...
6	xf1	...Ayase, with a grand total of 999 points!
7	Wg1	...What?!
8	O	999?!
9	6	H-how the spark did you get that many?
10	Xg1	Wow, Aya, you're amaaazing!!!
11	Wg1	Hold on, this can't be right, can it?!
12	xf1	...And for our joint winner, we have\nHildemarie, also with 999 points!
13	Xg1	No way! Hildie got that many too?!
14	zf1	Wait, wha...? I did...?!
15	xf1	And for our next joint winner, we have\nKanata, who scored 999 points as well!
16	_f1	...I think I can tell where this is going...
17	xf1	I'm not done! For our next joint winner,\nagain with 999 points, we have-
18	5	This *has* to be rigged, right?!
19	4	I must say, I have some serious concerns\nabout these tally results as presented.
20	Yg1	I did say the idea was to give\none point for every report...
21	xf1	But it makes sense that you get one point\nfor every monster you defeat, right?
22	xf1	And if we did that, then it'd be only fair\nto give out one point for every flower\nyou water in the garden...
23	3	...Are you serious...?
24	Wg1	...Tirky-Tallow, you idiot...
25	xf1	Oh, come on! We were counting so\nfrantically!
26	Yg1	Though at some point we got lost,\nso we just set all your points to 999...
27	xf1	Well, they all worked so hard, so we had\nto make the points reflect that!
28	xf1	After all, everyone did stuff they\ndidn't wanna do, or that they weren't\nvery good at!
29	Yg1	Anyway, this is getting old now.\nLet me skip ahead to the conclusion.
30	Yg1	As everyone got 999 points, that means\neveryone will now become lieutenant.
31	Xg1	Really?!
32	Wg1	Are you messing with me?!
33	4	They can't be serious...
34	1	So we're all lieutenants now...?
35	2	Come on, it's all a bit of fun. Right?
36	_f1	...So we still don't really have a lieutenant.
37	@f1	We worked so hard to get those\nstickers, too!
38	Xg1	It was a lot of fun, though!
39	xf1	I know, right?!
40	Wg1	Whether it was fun or not is beside the\npoint! What are we supposed to do now?
41	4	She makes a valid observation.
42	5	Yeah, but, I get what Tallow was going for.\nLet's not be too hard on the lad, yeah?
43	xf1	See, Lanz understood!
44	4	If he always makes judgments based on\nhis emotions, they will always be wrong.\n...Yes, now I see. Peas in a pod, you two.
45	5	Huh? When did we start\ntalking about vegetables?
46	xf1	Oh dear...
47	3	Knock it off, guys...
48	O	Hey, everyone, listen...
49	O	Thank you for everything you've done.\nIt makes me really, *really* happy.
50	O	You've always supported me and lent me\nyour strength...
51	O	...but now I think I've gotten spoiled\nby that treatment, and that's why I was\nno good.
52	xf1	What do you mean...?
53	O	I'm going to try harder to be a good leader\nto you all, even without a lieutenant.
54	Wg1	What are you talking about?\nYou've already been working plenty hard-
55	O	If I really have, then why is everyone\nfeeling so disconnected?
56	Wg1	...Well...
57	@f1	That's not your fault, Fifi!
58	O	No, it is. You were taking it easy on me,\nand it's caused you no end of anxiety.
59	O	This colony doesn't need a lieutenant.\nIt just needs me to get a grip on myself.
60	2	I understand how you feel, Fifi, but...\nare you sure you're ready...?
61	O	I'm sure. I need to make a change.
62	O	So...do you mind looking out for me a little\nmore while I figure things out...?
63	_f1	Of course, if that's what you've decided.
64	Wg1	We'll support you even more than before!
65	@f1	We won't let you do this alone!
66	xf1	Me too... You know I'll do anything\nfor you, Fiona...!
67	O	...Thank you, everyone.
68	O	...Well then, that's the plan.
69	O	If I just keep doing my best, it'll be OK...
evt/nq/msg_nq330300s.json
0	5	I gotta say, I was worried\nfor a minute there...
1	5	...but it seems like the mood in Colony Mu\nhas really changed. Dontcha think so?
2	2	For sure. It feels like everyone decided to\ntake on some degree of responsibility...
3	6	I'm so glad it all worked out!
4	2	...Hold on, I'm getting a message.
5	2	It's from Colony Mu...?
6	206Zg10	Hey, I'm sorry to bother you.\nWhere are you right no-
7	204Zg10	Aaagh! Wait! Don't go...! Stop it...!
8	204Zg10	Someone, help!
9	20700	What's going on? Hey-
10	2	Spark it, I lost them.
11	3	What was that all about?
12	O	That was Tussie's voice!
13	6	That voice sounded like it belonged to\nTussore...!
14	1	It sounds like something's wrong. Let's go\nand check it out!
evt/nq/msg_nq330301f.json
0	Zg1	Oh, hello. What's going on, everyone?
1	4	That's what we wanted to ask you!
2	1	By the sound of that message you sent,\nwe thought you might need urgent\nassistance or something...
3	Zg1	Oooh, that! Well, we do need help,\nbut I feel you might've misunderstood!
4	Zg1	Actually, we...
5	5	What the?!
6	5	Where did this fella come from...?!
7	bg1	Ah, I'm sorry!
8	bg1	This chunker is quite the rascal!\nThough I think it's just trying to be playful...
9	Zg1	Ah, you found it! What a relief!
10	4	...Is anyone going to clue us in...?
11	Zg1	So the truth is...we were talking\nabout trying to raise Armus!
12	bg1	Armu milk is so tasty, and there's so many\nof them roaming around here anyway!
13	bg1	...Well, that was our reasoning, but...
14	bg1	...they're actually quite a handful!\nThey keep trying to run away!
15	Zg1	This one went missing a short while ago,\nwhich is why I called you in a panic...
16	4	...Right.
17	Zg1	So sorry to alarm you!
18	O	Phew... I'm so glad it wasn't serious...
19	ag1	This the last one!
20	bg1	Thank you, Goo! You're a lifesaver!
21	1	Even Googoo is helping you?
22	ag1	It come wandering in flower patch.\nThere big trouble if it eat flowers\nGoogoo painstakingly grow!
23	bg1	We have to come up with something so we\ndon't have to chase them every day.
24	ag1	Why not use fences to build pen?\nThey maybe feel more calm if feel\nsafe, or so Googoo heard.
25	bg1	Ah, of course! A pen!
26	Zg1	You think Nico will give us materials...?
27	bg1	I think so! Let's ask Tallow and the rest\nto help, too!
28	bg1	I won't be able to carry it all on my own.\nTussore, can you take care of the Armus?
29	2	You sound like you know what you're\ntalking about. Where did you learn\nabout Armus?
30	ag1	Googoo think, just read in book\nsomewhere. Though not sure of\nany more details than that...
31	3	Is there a textbook or something\nabout them?
32	4	If it doesn't ring a bell with you, Eunie,\nthen it probably isn't in any Kevesi text.
33	3	...Then I guess it's not in any\nAgnian manuals either?
34	4	At least not as far as I know. This is\nthe first I've heard of purposefully\nkeeping Armus on colony grounds.
35	2	If neither of you know anything...then maybe\nthe City might have the information we need?
36	1	Let's go and look into it.
evt/nq/msg_nq330302t.json
0	Zg1	That Goo sure has some strange\nknowledge rattling around in her brain!
1	Zg1	She said she read it in a book, but I've\nnever heard of a manual about Armus\nand Arduns. Is that really a thing?
2	Zg1	Hm? Did you find something?
3	Zg1	What good little dudes! Looks like they've\nbeen waiting ages for some food.
4	Zg1	I wonder if the rain really will bring\nsome new little Armus...?
5	Zg1	I hope the clouds hurry up and\npour down on us soon...!

2	al1	There is thing friends want to know?\nWellwell love seeing curiosity in customers!
3	al1	But sea of knowledge is deep and vast.\nFriends need help of Wellwell to find?
4	1	If you could, that would be great. We're\nlooking for books about raising Armus...
5	al1	Oh, Wellwell have perfect intro textbook\nfor that. It have two volumes full of infos.
6	3	Oh my wings!\nYou actually have something?
7	al1	Shop of Wellwell full of treasures from\nall places and all times. Of course Wellwell\nhave something! Many somethings in fact!
8	al1	Not to worry. Wellwell sure that book still\nhere in shop.
9	al1	If friends have interest, can exchange\ngoods of equivalent value.

evt/nq/msg_nq330304f.json
0	Zg1	Wowww! I can't believe you actually\nfound a book on Armus!
1	2	I think it might be a bit difficult to follow,\nthough...
2	bg1	Hmm, let's take a look...
3	bg1	Whoa... There's a lot of pictures in here!
4	Zg1	Oh my socks and sparks, I love it!\nThey're so pretty and cute!!!
5	bg1	Uhm... This bit says something\nabout "adults"...?
6	bg1	And also..."children"?\nWhat does that mean?
7	4	Adults and children are...\nHm, how should I explain this...?
8	Zg1	I think big ones are "adults" and small ones\nare "children", Lotus.
9	bg1	Oh, you're right!\nThere's labels on the pictures!
10	3	...Guess you won't need to explain after all.
11	4	...Aw.
12	Zg1	Oh, look, it talks about making a pen, too!\nSeems like Goo was right!
13	Zg1	Oh, and here's the part about feeding.\nSays it's important what and how much\nthey eat...
14	Zg1	It's meant to affect the milk's taste, too!
15	bg1	Sparks, I forgot to get the Armu fodder...!\nI need to ask Nico for some, pronto...!
16	2	How much do you need?
17	bg1	Even with all that Nico can spare,\nwe only have about half of what\nthe book recommends...
18	Zg1	Well then, how about I gather the rest?
19	5	Or you could just feed them a little less-
20	5	Ow!!!
21	5	This one really has it out for me...!
22	5	All right, all right, come off it! If we help,\nwill you leave me alone?!
23	bg1	Would you really?! Thanks so much!
24	2	Should we give any food we find\nto you then, Tussore?
25	Zg1	Yes, please! Thank you ever so much!
26	Zg1	Heheheh. Aren't they kind, little buddy?
evt/nq/msg_nq330305f.json
0	Zg1	Thank you so much! This is gonna fill all\ntheir little bellies right up!
1	Zg1	Now there's just one last challenge for us.
2	4	One last challenge...?
3	Zg1	We have to pick a big Armu and\na big Ardun and put them together.
4	Zg1	Apparently, the day after it rains, a new\nlittle one will be born!
5	Zg1	It's really important that they're\ncompatible, it says, so I'm trying hard\nto work out which ones to go with...
6	5	"Compatible", you say... Just like how two\npeople can be compatible?
7	2	Maybe you should pick based\non personality, then?
8	1	Personality, huh...
9		Which pairing should we choose?
10		Rascally Ardun & Timid Armu
11	2	What about the mischievous Ardun and the\nshy Armu?
12	2	Maybe the Ardun would take care\nof the Armu when it's scared...
13	Zg1	Great idea! That combo sounds promising!
14		Easygoing Ardun & Impulsive Armu
15	2	What about the more carefree Ardun with\nthe moody Armu?
16	2	It feels like they could get along well,\ngoing at their own individual pace.
17	Zg1	Yeah, we don't want them to fight!
18		Rascally Ardun & Impulsive Armu
19	1	How about pairing the mischievous Ardun\nwith the moody Armu?
20	1	I don't know why,\nbut I think it could work.
21	Zg1	I see... I'll trust your instincts, as a veteran\nwarrior!
22		Easygoing Ardun & Timid Armu
23	1	How about putting the easygoing Ardun\nwith the shy Armu?
24	1	I think the carefree nature of that Ardun is\nless likely to scare the Armu.
25	Zg1	Yes! It's important they both feel calm.
26	Zg1	In that case, I guess we'll go with the\npairing you suggested...
27		Go with this pairing?
28		Yes
29		Choose again
30	Zg1	Thank you so much! Then I think\nwe've found our pairing!
31	3	Now we just have to wait for rain, right?
32	Zg1	Come to think of it, I think Goo mentioned\nsomething once that could help.
33	Zg1	Apparently there's a powerful Nopon out\nthere who can summon rain clouds!
34	5	Maybe we can turn to that Nopon if we\nreally need to, then.
35	2	Let's circle back when it's rained.
36	Zg1	OK! We'll be waiting!

0	5	No sparkin' way! There's more of 'em...?!
1	bg1	Yep! Four more, to be exact!
2	Zg1	Looks like even more of them made little\nones than just the pair we chose!
3	Zg1	We were just trying to think of what names\nto give them.
4	@f1	Nico - and, again, that's me - was against.\nI don't think we should give them names!\nIt'll be harder to say goodbye if we do...
5	Zg1	That's exactly why we *should* name\nthem! They're all living things, just like us.
6	Zg1	I want to thank them for coming into this\nworld and call them by their own names!
7	bg1	Right. They're living things, just like us...
8	@f1	...You're right. We have to face the facts!
9	Zg1	You can be Dropwort and Droppydun...
10	Zg1	And as for you... Hickory,\nand, uh... Hickydun?
11	Zg1	And you little ones can be... Umm...
12	@f1	Just relax, Tussie! You don't have to name\nall of them in one go.
13	bg1	Yeah, exactly. We'll all give it a think, too!
14	Zg1	Hold on a sec, I have an idea on the tip of\nmy tongue...!
15	1	..."Living things, just like us", huh...
16	2	She's got a point...
17	2	There's no such thing as a life that just\npasses by without leaving a single mark.
18	bg1	...Hey! Have you ever tasted\nfreshly-squeezed milk before?
19	@f1	It's so amazingly delicious!
20	2	I...would have to guess I most probably\nhave not, no... Did you say "squeezed"...?
21	1	What's different about it?
22	bg1	Heh heh. I'm excited for you to try it out\nand see! Hold on, let me get you some!
23	@f1	Nico will help, too!\nAs in, me, Nico, I mean.
24	2	You don't have to go to all that trouble\nfor us!
25	4	I think it would be wise to just accept their\noffer, or risk showing bad manners.
26	3	Anyway, if there's anything else you need\nhelp with, we're here for you!
27	Zg1	Thank you so much for everything you've\ndone for us!
28	Zg1	It would be amazing if you could keep\nhelping out on our new ranch!
29		Armus and Arduns are being\nreared on this ranch. Speak to\nTussore to help out.
30		Give enough food for them to grow\nup, pair up an Armu and Ardun\nand wait for the rain for baby time!
31		Keep helping and eventually you\nmight see some rare beasts.\nTake a load off and get ranching!

1	bg1	Then we just have to learn how to\nraise the Armus. There must be some\ntips and tricks...
2	bg1	Hey, listen! I've been thinking up a\nnew menu recently.
3	bg1	Once we start raising Armus, we'll have\nlots of fresh milk for our recipes.

2	@f1	Plus, she looked like she was having so\nmuch fun being with the Armus...
3	@f1	That makes Nico so, so happy!\nWho's a happy Nico? Me, that's who!
4	@f1	To be honest, Nico, who happens to be me,\nwasn't even thinking about the Armus' food...
5	@f1	But Nico - still me - has counted all the\nequipment we need, like for the pen and\nthe tents and stuff!

7	3	It sounds like the ranch is going\ngangbusters, and the colony's got\nsome of its old mojo back...
8	2	They're taking life one day at a time.\nThey're full of vitality, radiant...
9	O	I think everyone's eager to rise\nabove our old limitations...\nThey recognize it in each other.
10	O	They remember the times they\ncried together, all the pain and\nthe hard work...
11	O	Everyone does their best to show\nthe others that they're not giving up,\nand support one another that way.
12	5	...You've gotten a bit more cheerful too,\nFiona. You've noticed, right?
13	O	Heheh... Sure, maybe a little.
14	O	I don't want to hide any more,\nnot from myself and not from the world.\nI want to face the future with a smile!
15	O	Shoulder to shoulder with my friends!
16	4	Now I understand... Your pure resolve\nshines like a beacon, illuminating all\nthose around you.
17	O	It...it does?
18	O	...Oh, wait, I just remembered!\nAya's asked me to pass you a message!
19	1	A message, for us?
20	O	Sounded like she had a request\nof some sort... Man, I can't believe\nI almost forgot!
21	2	Well, it has been a busy time...
22	6	Oh, no worries! You remembered\nin time, and that's all that matters.\nWorst case, we'll apologize together!
23	O	Aww, Sennie... (sniff)
24	4	To try and ensure that it doesn't\ncome to that, perhaps we should\nact swiftly.
25	1	That sounds fair enough.\nLet's go see what Ayase needs.

0	Wg1	Fiona! You're late!
1	O	I'm so sorry... It just totally\nslipped my mind...
2	Wg1	Ah, I'm only teasing!\nIt's all good, really.
3	_f1	I'm actually a bit relieved to know\nyou've got your own Tirkin-brained\nmoments.
4	Wg1	Oh, relieved already?\nYou were nearly shaking\njust a minute ago...
5	O	...Are you mad at me?
6	Wg1	Of course we're not mad at you!
7	Wg1	But I've put a lot of stuff on your\nshoulders, and caused you lots of pain...\nReally, if anything, I'm mad at myself...
8	Wg1	...But hang on, we're not here\nto talk about me!
9	_f1	We've figured out some points to think on,\nand we know who our real enemy is, then\nwe were like... What do we do now?
10	_f1	And then we had an idea, and we were\nwondering if you wouldn't be willing to\nmaybe give us a hand with it, if it's-
11	Wg1	Let me make a long story short.
12	Wg1	We want you to capture Colony Mu.\nAnd obviously, we mean for real!
13	6	Capture?!
14	5	Uh, have you gone a bit funny?!\nWhat's wrong with you?
15	Wg1	Well, just think about it. Those Moebius\npeople have a huge amount of power, yes?
16	Wg1	So we figured, we'd need some really\nspecial training to prepare for their attack.
17	4	Simulated defensive maneuvers against\nhypothetical Moebius aggression...? Hmm...
18	3	I guess us Ouroboros would make for\na pretty accurate mock-enemy force, huh.
19	O	Right, I see...
20	O	All right then, I guess this time\nwe'll be on opposite sides...!
21	_f1	Nope. You're on the attack, Fiona.
22	O	...Whuh?
23	Wg1	We can't rely on you for everything,\ncan we? That way we'd never grow.
24	_f1	Yeah, we wanna change too.\nI've had about enough of sad\ngoodbyes...
25	_f1	And I promised Summer she could\nleave the colony in our hands...
26	O	...All right then.\nIf that's how you want it,\nthen I won't hold back!
27	1	What are the rules of engagement\nfor the exercise?
28	Wg1	No oddball tactics on either side, and...\nWell, I guess that's about everything.
29	Wg1	A lot of us are kinda inexperienced,\nso we want to have a straightforward\ncontest to start with!
30	1	Understood, sounds good. In that case,\nwe'll attack from the Migrow's Rosary side.
31	Wg1	Nice! I'll send Nico to wait there, so let\nher know when you're ready to begin.
32	Wg1	Looking forward to it, Ouroboros buds!
evt/nq/msg_nq330402t.json
0	Wg1	Once you're ready, go to Migrow's Rosary\nand give Nico the signal, all right?
1	Wg1	We'll be here, boning up on our tactics.\nI know it's just training, but we'll still be\nexpecting you to give it your all!
evt/nq/msg_nq330403t.json
0	@f1	Hey hey! Thanks for checking in on Nico!\nThat's me, I mean. But you knew that.\nAnyway, thanks!
1	@f1	...But for the moment, I think you'd better\ngo and talk to Aya, OK?
2	@f1	I think she's got some business with you?\nAnyway, she's been looking for you.
3	@f1	Hello, welcome, and thank you!
4	@f1	Now if you'd be so kind and head through\nColony Mu's Main Gate to begin your attack,\nplease and thank you!
5	@f1	When you defeat all the soldiers,\nthe exercise will be over!\nAre you all ready now?
6		Are you ready?
7		Sure thing.
8	@f1	Got it! Well then, best of luck\nand have fun!
9		Colony Mu is now in a training\nexercise. Talk to Nico if you\nwant them to take a break.
10		Hang on.
11	@f1	No worries, no worries at all.\nOnce you're feeling ready, let me know.
12	@f1	If you want to interrupt the exercise,\njust tell Nico! You know who that is.
13		Interrupt the exercise?
14		Yes, please.
15	@f1	Understood!\nI'll let Aya and the rest know.
16		Colony Mu have paused their\ntraining exercise. Talk to Nico\nif you want them to continue.
17		No, keep going.
18	@f1	Good luck and have fun!
19	@f1	Feeling ready to restart the exercise?
20		Restart the exercise?
21		Yes, please.
22		Hang on.
evt/nq/msg_nq330404f.json
0	Wg1	Oof, you guys are stronggggg!
1	Wg1	I can't believe it!\nI mean, we had the numbers,\nwe had the home turf advantage...!
2	_f1	...To be fair, we did give up\nthe "having Fiona" advantage...
3	_f1	...but still, I thought we'd be able to\nhold out a little longer than that...
4	Wg1	And they didn't even use the\nOuroboros power! And still, we\ngot well and truly thrashed...
5	_f1	Guess we're not strong enough, still.
6	_f1	...This stings, I won't lie...
7	Wg1	...Although hey, hang on.\nUsing the Ouroboros power,\nthat's basically like cheating, right?
8	Wg1	I mean, there's two of them turning\ninto one big thing! And they're strong!\nAnd it *changes shape*!
9	_f1	Looks pretty cool though.
10	Wg1	How does that make it better?!
11	_f1	It doesn't, I'm just saying.\n...This stings, I won't lie...
12	Wg1	...Ah!
13	Wg1	...Even you think so, eh, Kanata?\nI thought you'd be more stoic about it.
14	_f1	Yeah, I'm surprised myself.\nNever felt this way before.
15	_f1	Well, still... I've learned a lot today.
16	O	Me too, Kana! Me too.
17	O	I know it stings... But the outcome of\nthe exercise is less important than what\nwe've learned from it.
18	O	So let's talk it out, all of us.
19	_f1	Good plan.
20	xf1	All right! So, here's what I thought...\nI thought, wow! Are we weak, or what?!
21	@f1	Yep, ditto... Did we just learn\nwhat we're really worth?
22	O	Keep in mind that Ouroboros and\nMoebius are really pretty unique...
23	zf1	Yeah, if we're gonna fight them,\nwe probably shouldn't just pile in\nhead-on!
24	Zg1	...So basically, it looks like once they\nget inside the colony, we're dead.
25	Yg1	So we should try to keep 'em out?\nWe could make the gates stronger.
26	Yg1	Even if they break through,\nthey'll have bought us time\nto do something.
27	@f1	Something, like what kind of something?
28	Yg1	Hit 'em with a huge blast while they're\nstanding in place, or something?
29	@f1	Whoooooooa! Cooooooooool!
30	xf1	You know, you scare me sometimes.
31	_f1	But it's not a bad plan at all.\nWe could use the time we buy\nto make our escape.
32	bg1	OK, so first item - reinforce gate!\nWe'll make it mega-mega-mega-tough!
33	xf1	Then we'd better make it\nmega-mega-mega quick!
34	xf1	Nico? Materials, please!
35	@f1	Oh, if Nico - I - must.\nNico - again, I - will tap\ninto the good stuff!
36	O	If we're preparing for the worst, then\nI'd like to have an escape route secured...
37	Wg1	Like a ship?
38	zf1	A *ship*?!
39	Xg1	Whoa, bonkers-cool!
40	Wg1	I know, right?!?!
41	Zg1	Wonder if the Armus will fit as well...
42	Zg1	Aw, Nandun! You wanna help too?
43	bg1	That's all the help we'll need!
44	O	Well, we can think about the actual\nmeans later. For now, let's get all plans\nout in the open!
45	O	Even stuff we never did before, or\nstuff you never even thought of trying,\nlet's hear everything and anything!
46	O	We'll need all the help we can get,\nso let's review all our options one\nmore time.
47	Wg1	I agree with Fiona!
48	@f1	Same here!
49	xf1	Oh sparks, now it's getting exciting!
50	zf1	Hey, hey Fifi...\nWe haven't done the thing in a while,\nbut I think now's the perfect time!
51	O	...Huh? Here? *Now*?
52	Wg1	No time like the present!
53	@f1	Doing the thing will definitely\nput us in the right headspace!
54	_f1	Go on, Fiona, let's do it.
55	O	...All right, let's do it!
56	O	*Trust* your crew.
57	Wg1	*Trust* yourself.
58	_f1	*Trust* in victory!
59	zf1	All hearts as one!
60	O	We'll make it! Together!
61	xf1	A new path for\na new Colony Mu!
62	2	They've grown so strong...
63	5	It's more impressive that they're not just\nfocusing on winning or losing, but coming\nto grips with the future...
64	5	Kinda proud of 'em, won't lie...
65	O	Hey, c'mon, join in the discussion!
66	O	We have questions about your\nOuroboros powers and the like...
67	1	All right. Whatever we can do to help...
68	O	It's not just about helping...
69	O	We're all friends here, right...?\nWe should work this out as a team.
70	O	We have to plan together if we're gonna\n"make it" together!
71	5	Hahah... Shoulda seen it coming.
72	6	OK, let's go then!
73	O	Cool!
74	O	Hey, I just wanted to say...\nI'm really glad that we met.
75	5	H-huh? That's kinda sudden...
76	O	No it's not. I've always thought so.
77	O	And I promise to keep doing my best!

0	_f1	Thanks for agreeing to help with\nthe exercise. It'll be invaluable.
1	_f1	We have to learn to stand against\nthe unexpected. Fear and uncertainty\nmake enemies even more dangerous...
2	_f1	Summer's taught me that,\nbut she isn't with us any more...
3	_f1	So I'll take that lesson and\nbe sure to pass it on to the others.

0	4	I believe the usual saying goes,\n"seeing is believing"...
1	4	But even after seeing it I cannot quite\nbelieve how impressive Colony Mu's gate\nhas become.
2	O	Heheh, thanks! We worked hard on it,\nto make it mega-mega-mega-tough!
3	4	Certainly, the resilience is a major factor...
4	3	What's up with that face?\nYou got reservations?
5	4	Having a gate is not important.\nWhat counts, is stopping the enemy.
6	4	In other words, it would be to your benefit\nto reduce their capabilities before they can\neven reach the gate.
7	O	We've been training with cannons...\nDo you think that might not be enough...?
8	4	You can never be too prepared.
9	5	OK, so what do you propose?\nHow 'bout some pitfall traps?
10	3	Would be pretty tough to camouflage, no?\nI'm thinkin', in terms of terrain...
11	4	I would like to investigate in person.\nWe might come up with some ideas\non the ground.
12	4	Would you mind if I inspect the gate, too?
13	O	Not at all! Please, be my guest!
evt/nq/msg_nq330501f.json
0	Xg1	Hello, and thanks for all your hard work!\nIf you're curious about the gate, then I can\nassure you it's just *perfect*.
1	2	Yes, about that...
2	2	We've been talking about trying to do\nsomething to make the gate easier to\ndefend.
3	Xg1	Whoa, awesome timing, then!
4	Xg1	Tallow's been saying we\nneed to do that as well.
5	Xg1	Like, not just make ourselves all sturdy,\nbut also change how we fight to fit\naround it all...
6	O	I thought we'd discussed that already...
7	Xg1	No, I'm not just talking about the gate!\nI mean like, before when we fought, we\nrelied super heavily on you, Fifi...
8	Xg1	So we wanna try all sorts of new things.\nThat'll ensure we'll all make it! Together!
9	O	Aw, Mi... Mikki...\nI love youuuuuu!!!
10	Xg1	I love you toooooo!!!
11	Xg106xf10	Mikaela, come in! Do you read me?!?!
12	Xg10300	Whoa, not so loud!
13	Xg10300	What is it, Tallow?!
14	Xg104xf10	Close the gate! Moebius incoming!
15	Xg10700	What?! ...Roger that!!!
16	5	Should we intercept 'em?
17	1	No... Let's wait until we have a better\noverview of the situation. We don't want\nto act rashly and incur casualties...
18	O	Everyone, assume your battle stations!\nWe'll get in position atop the gate!
19	xf1	Cannons are ready to fire!
20	xf1	Stay calm and aim carefully...\nRemember your training!
21	Xg1	I know, all right? I was there!
22	3	What's the damage...?
23	N	...What's this?
24	N	Be that a new colony or some such...?
25	5	...You've gotta be snuffing me.

0	O	Hey, look...\nThere's something big in the ground here!
1	5	I really hope we got it right this time...
2	3	Why, you got better places to be?\nLess yapping and more digging, I say!
3	O	All right! We did it!
4	6	Good going, Fifi!
5	O	Thanks!
6	1	I'm glad we found it, but it's definitely\nnot easy to transport this thing...
7	2	You think that's why nobody\ncomes to gather them any more?
8	4	...With the exception of Triton.
9	3	Makes sense that nobody'd\nknow this place, apart from him...
10	O	Let's get this back to the Cap'n, then.\nI'm sure he'll be excited for it!
11	2	That's putting it lightly...\nAll right, back to Colony Mu, then.
evt/nq/msg_nq330508f.json
0	N	Arrrr, yes, tharr it be, and no mistakin'!
1	N	It brings back memories... I remember\ndigging the sand full of holes in me\nsearch for this elusive bivalve...!
2	5	Some things don't change, huh...?
3	3	Next time, you can look for it yourself,\nhow about that? Does it even count as\ntreasure if it's not you that found it?
4	N	...Hrm...?\nThose words, they tug at me mind...
5	N	...Ah yes, now I remember!\nIt was *I* that said something\nlike that, once upon a time.
6	O	...Wait, who said it? You did? But...
7	N	Nay, I mean *I*, the sourpuss Moebius.
8	N	She'd walk around carryin' this empty\ntreasure chest, sayin' when she found\na treasure, she'd put it inside...
9	N	So I try to put a Clammoth inside,\nand what do I get for my trouble?\nA severe tongue-lashing, so I did!
10	3	Yeah, what else did you expect?
11	N	She said that things only have value when\nye've found them yerself, or some such...\nBut that's hogwash.
12	N	She'd lost track of what's really important.
13	O	Were you two friends...?
14	N	Well, I s'pose we were, at that...
15	N	Strangely, it feels lonely to think\nof her as a mere "acquaintance".
16	O	If it feels lonely, it's because you've\nshared fun times together...
17	O	If you wanted to be around each other,\nthat's friendship, all right.
18	N	Sounds like ye had a friend\nlike that yerself, eh, lass?
19	O	...Yeah.\nA very special, much-loved friend...
20	O	Someone I'll never be able to forgive...
21	N	Hahah... Sounds like ye've\nbutted heads pretty hard there.
22	O	...You can tell?
23	N	Aye. Great happiness and great sufferin'\nare blown in by the same winds, ye know.\nYe've got to take the bad with the good.
24	N	Both these things are only possible\nwhen you've got a connection, and even\nthat only when ye're completely honest.
25	N	She musta been a good friend, lass.
26	O	...Thank you, Cap'n.\nMy memories of her are important.
27	O	You could say, they're my treasure!
28	N	Very well said! I wonder which one'd win,\nif we set them in a contest against my\nClammoth, eh?
29	O	I don't think I want to compare them...\nThe value of memories is relative, anyway.
30	O	Each one is special, and its own\nlittle treasure. That's why you can\nnever have too many friends, I think.
31	N	Aw, lassie... Ye're somethin' else.
32	N	But ye're right about one thing - ye can\nnever have enough treasure! So I'm glad\nwe managed to become such fast friends.
33	N	...Arrr, no. Was that too soppy?\nTell me it weren't too soppy...
34	O	No no, not at all!
35	O	So please, drop by for a chat\nwhenever you feel like it!
36	N	Ah, to be sure, lass!\nJust make sure you don't die before then!
37	O	Same to you, Cap'n!\nIt's a promise!

0	Xg1	That person is...a Moebius, right?\nDoesn't that make them our enemy?
1	Xg1	If he comes at us, I'll...\nI'll protect everyone, I swear!
2	Xg1	He's ordering a lot!\nHe can't really be\n*that* hungry, can he?!
3	Xg1	But he's eating it all with such gusto...\nAghhhhh, now I've confused myself!
4	Xg1	Just listen, this Cap'n guy is awful!
5	Xg1	He just won't remember my name!\nBut he remembered Tallow's?! Unfair!
evt/nq/msg_nq330552t.json
0	bg1	How'd it go? Did we nail the enemy?!
1	bg1	...Wait, what? He's coming here?!
2	bg1	W-wait, hold on!\nI gotta prepare mentally!
3	bg1	If you're looking for a Clammoth,\nI'd say look on Needle Reef Beach,\nor maybe Krezen Cliffs...?
4	bg1	Anyway, it's a huge clam,\nso at least you'll know it\nwhen you see it!
5	bg1	Oh, did you find a Clammoth?
6	bg1	While we were waiting, the Cap'n and me\ngot to talking, and... He's really a nice guy!
evt/nq/msg_nq330553t.json
0	xf1	H-he... He got hit with a full salvo, right?\nAnd still, not a scratch on him...?!
1	xf1	Are you sure we can let\nthe Moebius just walk into\nthe Colony...?!
2	xf1	I'll... I'll come with you!\nI'm not scared... N-n-no,\nreally, I'm not!!!
3	xf1	He's gonna eat ALL THIS?\nAnd on my tab?!\nTell me you're joking?!?!
4	xf1	You know, I think I finally *get*\nwhat the Cap'n's all about!
5	xf1	I've seen the light now!\nA true Man of the Sea never\nsays no to seconds!
evt/nq/msg_nq330600s.json
0	5	So Tallow's started holding these\n"conferences", eh?
1	O	Yeah, he wants to know what it is\neveryone wants to do, as well as\nwhat their concerns are.
2	O	He and his squad are spearheading the\ninitiative, and finding out what everyone\nhas to say.
3	O	Once he's heard them out, he'll\nstart to get a better picture of\nwhat's on their mind.
4	1	So that's why there was a big line?
5	5	Hahaha, you guys sure know how to\ndo "busy", don't ya?
6	6	Still, everyone in Colony Mu seems to be\nhaving plenty of fun.
7	O	...I suppose that's because they have more\nto be cheerful about than sad about.
8	O	You should hear how eager they are to\nhelp out; they're always "I wanna do that!"\nor "let's do this!"
9	5	Mu sounds like an altogether different\ncolony now. You must be chuffed, right?
10	O	You're not wrong...
11	O	But now that everyone's working so\nhard for the colony, I haven't got quite\nso much to do myself.
12	6	Wait, really?
13	O	Yeah. I'm getting the feeling that my role\nmight just have come to an end...
14	5	Man, before you said that, I was starting\nto forget that you're a Tirkinhead.
15	O	N-no I'm not!
16	2	If being at a loose end is bothering you\nso much, maybe you should talk to Tallow\nabout it.
17	O	But, do you really think that's the kind\nof thing I ought to bother him with?\nIt's not a problem, exactly.
18	2	Everybody works together as one in\nColony Mu, right? I'm sure Tallow would\nlove to hear whatever's on your mind.
19	5	She's right! You can even share a few\nbants with Tallow while you're getting\nyour worries fixed. It's win-win!
evt/nq/msg_nq330601f.json
0	xf1	Thanks for the drink. All this talking has\nreally dried up my throat.
1	zf1	Hehe, I suspected as much.
2	zf1	Right, I'll be off, then!
3	xf1	Good luck!
4	xf1	Sorry to keep you waiting! What's up?
5	O	Oh, I mean, nothing really... Have you\nstopped the conference for the day?
6	xf1	No, it's just that I've talked my throat dry,\nso I'm taking a quick break.
7	O	Hmmm... Maybe you do need some help\nafter all? It must be difficult for you to do\nall this on your own.
8	xf1	I'm fine, honest. I wouldn't learn anything,\nif I didn't do things on my own.
9	O	Yeah, I get that. But I really want to\ndo what I can to help the Colony too.
10	O	It's not fair that I only get to relax while\neveryone's working so hard.
11	xf1	Oh, so, that's what it is...?
12	xf1	If you're sore about not having anything\nto do, how about some patrol duties?
13	xf1	While you're at it...
14	xf1	I'd like to know what Ayase's number one\nconcern is right now. Go ask her for me.
15	O	OK!
16	1	Is that everything?
17	xf1	If you could get it done then and there,\nthat'd be great.
18	6	Let's do this, Fifi.\nTogether, we'll get it done, no problem!
19	O	Yeah!
20	O	Patrol duty goes to three different\npatrol points by boat.
21	O	I'll send the locations to your Irises now!
evt/nq/msg_nq330602f.json
0	O	Hey, wait. What's that ship over there...?
1	O	Heeey!\nOver here!
2	Xg1	Well, how about this! I sure didn't expect\nto meet you here out in the open seas!
3	O	Me neither! What's the problem?
4	Wg1	We wanted to see how your ship's doing.\nWe've been going round the patrol points,\nafter all.
5	O	Really?! But I'm on patrol duty too!
6	Xg1	Seriously?!
7	Wg1	But we told Tallow we'd go on patrol...\nHe must've forgotten to tell us about\nyou guys then.
8	O	...I get it now. He must've sent me\nout knowing you two were on duty.
9	O	I wanted to help, but I just caused\nhim more inconvenience...
10	6	Fifi...
11	O	...Do you mind if I ask you one more\nthing? Tallow wants to know this:
12	O	what's your number one concern\nright now?
13	Wg1	...That you aren't getting enough rest.
14	O	What? I'm getting plenty of rest, though!
15	Wg1	No you aren't, though!
16	Wg1	You're going out on missions for the\ncolony all while fighting Moebius...
17	Wg1	To put it bluntly, I think you've got a bad\nhabit of working yourself half to death.
18	O	B-but... I...
19	O	...I think you might be right...
20	Xg1	Thing is, I love how hard you work\nfor our sake, Fiona...
21	Xg1	But we also want to work hard like you\ndo to help relieve some of that burden\non your shoulders.
22	Xg1	So, please. Rely on us more! You can skip\nout on missions if you need to, OK?
23	O	Skip out on missions?!\nI couldn't possibly do that!
24	2	Now this is just what I think...
25	2	but I get the feeling that for Fiona,\nworking hard and surviving aren't\ntwo different things at all.
26	2	She wants to live with you all. When she\ndoesn't "work hard", she feels like she's\nnot doing her fair share.
27	2	It's because you two care so much for\nFiona that you told her how worried you\nwere that she was overworking herself.
28	2	...Am I wrong, Fiona?
29	O	You aren't!
30	Wg1	In fact, I think you've helped us all\nunderstand why Fiona acts like she does!
31	2	Pleased to hear it. We all care about those\nprecious to us in our own way.
32	2	So I thought that's where the issue\nmight've been.
33	Xg1	I-I'd never thought of it like that, Mio!\nYou're like a mind reader!
34	Wg1	In short, then, it's because we all care\nabout each other differently...
35	Wg1	...that we didn't recognize what the other\nwas feeling?
36	O	And that's despite the both of us\njust wanting to care and look out\nfor each other.
37	O	...I'm sorry. It was me feeling like the only\none relaxing that caused all this trouble\nfor everyone...
38	Wg1	It was also us pushing how we\nwere feeling onto you as well...\nSo we're sorry too.
39	O	Oh, I...I just love you two so much!
40	Xg1	We love you just as much, Fiona!
41	6	Well...case closed, I suppose?
42	2	I'd say so.
43	2	I imagine this is what Tallow was\ntrying to get across to her.
44	Wg1	...Right, I was thinking of coming back\nhome after we'd cleaned up these\nLevnis wreckages, but...
45	O	Oh! I'd love to help out!\nDo you mind?
46	Wg1	Heh, not at all.
47	O	By the way...it's going to take me a while\nto fully change my habits...
48	O	...so I'm bound to make you guys worry\nagain from time to time. However, I'll get\nthere eventually, just you watch!
49	Wg1	Of course you will!\nWe have complete faith in you!
evt/nq/msg_nq330603f.json

evt/nq/msg_nq330605f.json
0	O	Shu...? Kana...?
1	Yg1	Fiona! And Ouroboros, too...
2	O	Were you the ones going around\ncleaning up the Levnis wreckages?
3	Yg1	That was us, all right. These wreckages\nhave been a nuisance for far too long.
4	_f1	All they do is block the road, and make\ntravel difficult. It's not even like they're\nany good as cover in a battle, either.
5	O	Ah, ha. So, you two decided to take the\ninitiative then?
6	_f1	You know, you're looking well, Fiona.\nWhat changed?
7	O	What? B-but how...?!
8	_f1	Haha, bullseye.
9	_f1	You're beaming from ear to ear.\nAnd after you've been so gloomy\nrecently...
10	Yg1	You *really* know how to take\nthe initiative, huh?
11	6	So, then you two were doing all\nthis for Fiona?
12	Yg1	Yeah, because we wanted to see her\nwith a smile on her face.
13	Yg1	We figured that if we cleaned up all\nthe battle damage around the colony,\nthat'd do it.
14	_f1	We may not be able to fight Moebius...
15	_f1	...but we can make sure that the colony is\na nicer, comfier place to be in, at least.
16	O	So, then...you were thinking of\nwhat you could do for me...
17	Yg1	We're really worried about you.
18	Yg1	You always get straight to working hard on\nsomething no matter how bad of a state\nyou're in.
19	Yg1	So, at the very least, we wanted to make\nthe colony a place where you could relax\nand take your mind off things.
20	_f1	It's not every day you see him\nget so fired up about something.
21	Yg1	...C'mon, you're just exaggerating now.\nI'm just stating the obvious, that's all.
22	Yg1	Anyway, every day, we've been thinking\nabout how we can make Colony Mu a\nbetter place for everyone.
23	_f1	As a result, it was just kinda natural that\nour squad ended up becoming busy with\nstuff.
24	6	There's all kinds of "natural" things that\nconnect back to you, Fifi.
25	O	...That would never even have occurred\nto me...
26	O	I really am a stupid Tirkinhead...
27	_f1	Fiona?
28	O	Right, you two! You've got something you\nwant to do today, right?! Tell me!
29	Yg1	R-right now?! Um, let's see...
30	Yg1	...I think... Oh, yeah!
31	Yg1	I think that today I'd like us to\nall eat together, Fiona.
32	O	With me?
33	Yg1	Yeah, I mean... It's not a big deal, but...\nI just miss our common meals, I guess?
34	_f1	Err... Clingy much, Shu?
35	Yg1	Whoa, steady on...
36	_f1	Heh, all this talking has suddenly made\nme peckish.
37	O	...OK then. Today, we'll all eat together!
38	2	Then we'd better inform Lotus.
39	3	Let's ask if there's anything we can\ndo to help her out.
40	O	OK!
evt/nq/msg_nq330606t.json

1	bg1	You all put in a real shift capturing\nthat fish for today's meal.
2	bg1	So much so that there'll be seconds for\neveryone! So no snacking before I'm done\ncooking, you got that?
3	bg1	...Hey, you guys!\nHave you seen Hildemarie around?
4	bg1	I'm almost done with the pies,\nand I wouldn't want her to miss out.
5	5	For real, now?\nWhere could she have gone?
6	O	Then we'll go look for her right now!
7	O	So you just focus on making those yummy\nfish pies! I'm going to be eating together\nwith *everyone* today, I know that much.
8	bg1	You're joining in?!\nNow that's cause for celebration, that is!
9	bg1	All righty, all righty! Just you wait, Fiona!\nThese fish pies are gonna be the best\nsnuffing fish pies you'll ever taste!
10	bg1	I'm counting on you to find Hildemarie.

17	zf1	When I'm with you, it makes me wanna\nhave a go at anything! Do everything I\ncan to make it happen!
18	zf1	That's what I really admire about you.\nI want to be able to do that...be able to\ninspire others with what I do.
19	O	But I think you already do, you know?
20	O	Your words really help me shine.
21	zf1	Shine...?
22	O	I really think you've got what\nit takes to become a Healer.
23	O	Would you mind giving it a go together?
24	zf1	Wait, are you really sure?!
25	O	What one person can do, two people can\ndo better, I think.
26	O	Wil you join me, so we can support\nColony Mu together?
27	zf1	I will!\nWe'll do this together!
28	zf1	Thank you, Fifi!

9	5	Don't mind if I do.
10	6	What's wrong? Don't feel like eating?
11	Wg1	Nah, I feel like eating. It's just that the\nmoment I started to relax, tiredness\nsuddenly came over me...
12	_f1	...I can imagine. Perhaps you've used up\nall your eating energy too...
13	xf1	Well, if no one's going to eat that pie, I'll-

1	Q	Huh? What can I do you for, Seeker?
2	rj1	Uhm... I was just looking for you\n'cause I wanted to get your advice\nabout something.
3	Q	Oh. It's you lot.
4	1	What are you up to, Ghondor?
5	Q	Well, this chump here was just saying he\nwanted to pick my brains about something.\nHave you met Seeker yet?
6	Q	OK, so what you got for me, Seeker?\nGotta be something big if you're daring\nto bother me, huh?
7	rj1	That's right! The thing is, people from the\nprison camp are getting ready to head\nback to the City right now.
8	Q	You're sending our guys back, huh?
9	rj1	That's right.
10	2	That's something to be welcomed, surely?\nIf they're going home to the City?
11	rj1	It is, for sure, but here's the rub. There are\nso many of them, we can't get them back\nwith Levnis transports only.
12	rj1	So we're going to use a boat to get them\nto Farview Cape.
13	Q	I gotcha. You want me to get set up to\nbring them in from there, is that right?
14	rj1	Yeah, right. I've sourced the boat from\nlogistics already. I guess you got the gist\nnow, so can I leave the details with you?
15	rj1	Darnie from the supply team's usually\nright on top of things. I'm sure she can fill\nyou in when it comes to the finer points.
16	Q	Yeah, I'm good with all that, mate.\nBut if anyone tries to mess with me,\nI reserve the right to mess 'em up. Deal?
17	6	Ghondor...?!
18	Q	I don't fully trust this lot, not yet.\nYou understand, dontcha, dag?
19	rj1	Yeah, painfully aware, cheers. Even so,\nif you think of the pros and cons, I'm sure\nyou'll agree it's a good deal for you too.
20	Q	I did, and that's exactly why\nI said yes. Noah, you lot had\nbetter come along for the ride.
21	Q	You guys mind heading out there for me?
22	3	Looks like we got railroaded into that...\nWell, whatever. It should be easy enough!
23	rj1	I'm sure that with so many capable hands\non task, the job will get done in no time at\nall! Right, leaving it with you then.
evt/nq/msg_nq340101t.json
0	1	We came here with some instructions from\nSeeker...
1	sj1	Ah, this is about the boat, right? I'm going\nforward with the preparations now.
2	2	Is there anything we need to do to help?
3	sj1	Actually, yes. Could you open the\nfloodgate? We've got our hands full\ngetting ready for launch right now.
4	sj1	You'll find the panel for it in the\ncontrol facility. The former prisoners\nare all waiting in the harbor.
5	3	If that's all we need to do, we'll be done\nin no time at all.
6	sj1	Could you open the floodgate?\nYou'll find the panel for it in the\ncontrol facility.
7	sj1	Please get rid of the monsters on\nFarview Cape for us, would you?
evt/nq/msg_nq340102f.json
0	6	OK... So the floodgate is open now.
1	sj1	Thanks a million for that!\nIt's a massive help.
2	3	So is everything good now?
3	sj1	Not quite... Technically, this would be for\nthe Lost Numbers' benefit, not ours, but...
4	Q	Oh yeah? Well, it's not something I asked\nfor, at least.
5	Q	Oh yeah? Well, it's not something I asked\nfor, I can tell you that.
6	6	Ghondor! Whatcha been up to?
7	Q	Ah, Aggy and Oggy needed me for some\njunk. So, who put in this request from the\nLost Numbers then?
8	_j1	That would've been me, Ghondor!
9	Q	You, Dana? Well. What's the story, then?
10	Q	What do we gotta do now?
11	_j1	I'd like you to clear out the monsters\nfrom Farview Cape.
12	_j1	If we're bringing everyone back, it could\nget pretty hairy if there are monsters there.
13	4	Of course, it's our pleasure.\nBut why don't you want to fight yourself?
14	_j1	Trust me, I'll be hot on your trail, with\nthe lot from the prison camp in tow.
15	4	Understood.
16	_j1	So, I'll leave it up to you. I'm sure it\nwon't present a major problem for the\nlikes of you!
17	Q	Yeah, Dana's a real smart cookie,\nall right. She takes care of her own\njob, and nothing else.
18	1	Well, if that's the situation, let's get out\nthere and handle those monsters.
evt/nq/msg_nq340104f.json
0	Wk1	Ah, it's a pretty strange ol' feeling,\nain't it? To think we'll be heading\nback to the City...
1	Xk1	And it's all thanks to you guys!
2	1	Actually, it wasn't us that took care of all\nthe preparations.
3	Xk1	I reckon I'm about due to have\na really good, long think about the future.
4	2	Yeah? That's wise, I think.
5	5	Aren't you gonna board the boat?
6	_j1	I'm going to head back to Agnus Castle.\nGot a ton of stuff to handle since Anton's\ncopped it.
7	_j1	He was a really serious person, y'know.\nI feel like I need to do as much as I can\nof what he left undone.
8	1	I...can understand that.
9	_j1	Can you guys go with them? There's no\ntelling what might pop up during transit.
10	5	We got it. We'll take good care of them till\nwe get them where they're going.
11	_j1	OK. They're in your hands now!
evt/nq/msg_nq340105t.json
0	hk1	I'm about to set off. Are your\npreparations complete?
1		Go to the City?
2		Yes
3	1	Yeah, we're ready.
4		No
5	hk1	Just give me a shout when\nyou're ready to go, OK?
6		You can't use this now, as the City is\nunder attack. Finish Sena's side story\nfirst. (Skip travel to City is allowed.)
evt/nq/msg_nq340108f.json
0	Wk1	Back in the City at last...
1	Xk1	Yeah... Here we are...\nBack in the Big Juicy Broccoli,\nafter all this time...
2	Xk1	Thank you... We only made it back here\nbecause of you.
3	2	It was because you hung in there, too. You\nmade it here because you didn't give up\nwhen it got tough.
4	Xk1	Yeah... Yeah, I guess you're right.
5	2	Well, we'll be seeing you!
6	Xk1	Just look after Ghondor and the rest for\nus, won't you?
7	2	Yeah, we got you!
evt/nq/msg_nq340151t.json
0	rj1	Go speak to Darnie, will you? She's taking\ncare of all the preparations.
1	rj1	So, how did things go? I imagine\nit wasn't a picnic, but still, glad\nyou're hanging in there.
evt/nq/msg_nq340152t.json
0	oV	If there's any shenanigans from any\nof those Agnians, just give 'em\nhell, yeah?
evt/nq/msg_nq340153t.json
0	_j1	We got quite a bit to take care of with the\npreparations here. Did you hear anything\nfrom Darnie?
1	_j1	The preparations look to be about\ndone. All we gotta do is get that\nfloodgate open.
2	_j1	We'd like you to clear out the monsters\non Farview Cape, all right?
3		
evt/nq/msg_nq340154t.json
0	Wk1	Ah, I'm all rushed and hustled off my feet\nwith getting ready right now...
1	Wk1	The prep's all done now. But it's still\na kind of funny feeling to be leaving,\nsomehow...
2		
evt/nq/msg_nq340155t.json
0	Xk1	Ah, so much to do, and so busy with it!
1	Xk1	We're all ready to cast off now.\nAh, I can hardly believe we're\ngoing back to the City...
2		
evt/nq/msg_nq340156t.json
0	jW1	Er, ma'am! Seeker was, uhm...seeking you.
1	jW1	M'lady's not here right now. She and\nSeeker have some business to attend to.
2	jW1	We'll stay back at Agnus Castle.\nPlease handle the rest!
3	jW1	Ah, ma'am is with you! Then you\nhave nothing at all to worry about!
evt/nq/msg_nq340157t.json
0	kW1	I think Seeker was looking for you, m'lady.
1	kW1	M'lady's in talks with the Agnians right now.\nLooks like she'll be quite some time!
2	kW1	I'll stay here with Aggy. Thanks for dealing\nwith that! Appreciate it!
3	kW1	I can't imagine you've much to worry\nabout with m'lady at your side, no?
evt/nq/msg_nq340200s.json
0	2	That rumor we heard about Seeker,\nthe guy who spoke to Ghondor...
1	4	Yes... It seems the people of the City\ndon't trust him. They don't understand\nhis motives.
2	1	In a way, it's understandable. The situation\nis what it is, and there's no easy fix for it.
3	Q	Pff... Think back on what those bastards\ndid to us, all right? Never mind an easy\nfix... I don't think there's any fixing it at all.
4	A	Seeker is an old acquaintance of mine.\nOriginally, he was an employee of the\nInternal Affairs Bureau of Agnus Castle.
5	A	The Seeker I knew was a fairly\nstraightforward man, with no particular\nstrange quirks about him...
6	3	When we talked to him, he struck me as,\nlike, industrious, I guess? Diligent, innit.
7	3	He did a fair bit to help when they were\nsending Lost Numbers back to the City\nand all that...
8	5	Well, whichever way he was or seemed,\nif he's got a bone to pick with the City,\nwe gotta nip that in the bud.
9	4	...A fair point. How about we make\nsome inquiries into Seeker, then?
10	2	If we ask around with the Agnians,\nwe're bound to learn something.
11	3	A'ight, sorted. Let's do it then!
evt/nq/msg_nq340201t.json
0	vj1	You wanna know about Seeker?\nSure, I don't mind...
1	vj1	Only, there's nothing really to tell.\nI guess he's serious about his work.\nThere's that, I suppose.
2	vj1	It always seemed like the higher-ups liked\nhim well enough, too. He got a load of\nawards, if I'm remembering right...
3	vj1	Seeker was serious about work,\nand the higher-ups liked him.
4	vj1	If you're looking for provisions, it's the\nsalvage corps from logistics that're in\ncharge of those.
evt/nq/msg_nq340202t.json
0	sj1	Huh... Asking about Seeker, yeah?\nI know him well, we were on the\nsame team.
1	sj1	For the longest time, he was a real\nstraight shooter, total over-serious nerd.\nNothing like he is now...
2	sj1	Since the Clock got smashed, he's a lot\nmore proactive and full-on. Personally?\nI like him way better now.
3	sj1	Seeker got really outgoing since we were\nliberated. Maybe he'd been repressing that\nside of him all along. You reckon?
4	sj1	Seeker's gotten in touch.\nYou here about the provisions?
5	sj1	We don't have quite enough for the\ntransport to the City, so we'd need\na bit of help getting them together.
6	sj1	We've got all the provisions\nwe requested. Thanks bunches.
7	sj1	Would you be so kind and give Seeker\nthe good news?
8	sj1	Please, share the news with Seeker.
evt/nq/msg_nq340203t.json
0	uj1	Seeker? I hear he's been friends\nwith the commander over at Lambda,\nand for a long time, too.
1	uj1	Although to be fair, he did used to be\nInternal Affairs, so I guess it's no wonder\nhe's got friends in high places...
2	uj1	I hear Seeker's old pals with Lambda's\ncommander. Talk about well-connected...
3	uj1	Provisions? Ah yeah!\nSeeker did say he'd help.
evt/nq/msg_nq340204t.json
0	tj1	I remember Seeker saying he wanted to\ndo something about the Lost Numbers'\nill feelings towards us.
1	tj1	He was like, I don't know how it'll go,\nbut we gotta find a way to work together\nand move past it.
2	tj1	Seeker said he wanted to do something\nto get rid of the Lost Numbers' ill feelings\ntowards us.
3	tj1	Provisions? Yeah, sure, if you need 'em,\nI'm happy to share.
4	tj1	Did you make good use\nof those provisions?
evt/nq/msg_nq340205s.json
0	1	From what we've been hearing,\nit seems he understands the problems\naffecting Agnus Castle as a whole.
1	4	He's also said to be a diligent worker,\nand nobody seemed to wish him ill.
2	5	All right, sure, but he was in the\nprison camp for a reason, right?\nThings can't be that simple.
3	4	I did initially suspect that there might have\nbeen some hidden motive behind Seeker's\nactions, but it no longer seems likely.
4	2	Right... I think it's beyond doubt that\nhe's thinking about moving things in\na more positive direction.
5	2	And also... Since he's working hard\nto reform this place, don't you think\nwe could stand to lend him a hand?
6	3	Well, seems he'd be worth having\na chat with, at least. Even if nothing\ncomes of it.
7	6	Yeah... If he's trying to make amends to\nthe Lost Numbers, then it's definitely\nworth a try!
8	2	Let's all go and talk to Seeker, then.
evt/nq/msg_nq340206f.json
0	Q	Huh? What're you lot up to?
1	1	Er... We wanted to talk to Seeker...?
2	Q	Ah, perfect timing then! Oi, Seeker!\nGet these dags and Oggy to help you,\nwould ya?
3	2	Huh? What's this about, now?
4	rj1	Oh, hey Ghondor, I've\nbeen looking for you.
5	Q	What now?
6	rj1	Well, I've been thinking, I'd like to\ntransport some of the provisions from\nAgnus Castle over to the City.
7	3	Provisions? Now there's a golden idea.
8	2	OK, but why? What's in it for Agnus?
9	rj1	I'm not sure there'd be a really\nclear pay-off for us, however...
10	rj1	But, here's the thing. When the fake Queen\nwas revealed, I saw Consuls from Keves\nstanding there, and it made me sick.
11	rj1	All the things I thought were right...\nIn that moment, that *instant*, I saw\njust how mistaken I'd been.
12	rj1	And mistakes need to be corrected.\nEven if it takes my entire remaining life.
13	rj1	That's why I want to give the City its due.\nI hope it'll make you stronger, and I hope\nI can spend my strength repaying you.
14	Q	Whoa! Dude, you're gonna make me bawl!\nEh, Oggy?
15	kW1	We, um, y-yes.\nThis is most gracious.
16	rj1	First, we repatriated everyone\nwho'd go, back to the City.
17	rj1	So then, I figured, why not\nsend some provisions next...?
18	Q	Are we really that strapped for grub,\nthough?
19	kW1	M'lady, what are you saying! We always\nneed great quantities of food to get by!
20	Q	And whose fault is that, d'you reckon,\nyou bottomless pit of a man?
21	rj1	In any case, you could stand to have a\nbit more food, surely? As luck would\nhave it, we have plenty here.
22	rj1	If we could get them processed\nto be more shelf-stable, they'd make\nfor good portable meals, too.
23	5	Sounds like it'd be quick going\nif we pitched in as well.
24	rj1	Yes, if you could. We'd also appreciate\nif you could collect whatever's missing\nand leave it with Darnie.
25	kW1	And then, we City people\ncan take it from there.
26	rj1	Yes, that would be fantastic, thanks.
27	kW1	That is the long and short of it.\nWe'd be thankful for your assistance.
28	1	You will have it, rest easy.
evt/nq/msg_nq340207t.json
0	rj1	Your reputation precedes you, even here.
1	rj1	Please ask Darnie about the provisions\nto be sent to the City.
2	rj1	Oh, and also, take this.\nHopefully it'll help make up\nthe shortfall...
3	rj1	Please ask Darnie about the provisions\nto be sent to the City.
evt/nq/msg_nq340208t.json
0	jW1	Seeker is...a slippery man.\nWhether he is a good one\nor not... I cannot quite tell.
1	jW1	You're saying you need provisions?\nI've collected some myself, so here,\nplease take them!
2	jW1	Sending food to the City...\nHow admirable of that Seeker chap.
3	jW1	The food I gave you?\nPicked it in the Perimeter Woodland.
4	jW1	I hope Cory and Brenda are doing well...
evt/nq/msg_nq340209f.json
0	2	We've finished collecting the food,\nand handed it all over.
1	rj1	Thanks so much. I'm glad\nI turned to you for help.
2	kW1	Well done, Noah and friends!\nAlways so quick to aid, it's marvelous.
3	rj1	Even in a difficult situation like this one,\nwe can only try to move forward.
4	rj1	And I believe that when we work together,\nwe can achieve almost anything.
5	1	I think so too... And we're\nalways ready to do our part!
6	3	Wow, Seeker, sounds like something\na real leader would say, innit.
7	Q	You wanna look elsewhere next time\nyou say something pointed like that?
8	Q	...But yeah, that was a good line.\nI'll even go out on a limb and believe it.
9	rj1	Thank you. I'll do all I can to live up\nto the trust you've placed in me.
evt/nq/msg_nq340251t.json
0	oV	Seeker...? Yeah, I don't think I've got\nanything to say on the subject, just yet.
1	oV	Still can't quite tell what sits\nbehind those eyes of his...
2	oV	I feel kinda bad about fobbing all this\nwork off on you lot, but it needed doing.
evt/nq/msg_nq340252t.json
0	kW1	Seeker, huh...\nNot a big fan, I have to say.
1	kW1	M'lady! You really ought to notify us\nbefore taking leave next time... Just so\nwe don't worry, you understand...
2	kW1	M'lady considers dealing with Seeker as\nsomewhat beneath her. Still doesn't mean\nshe should just push it onto me...
3	kW1	I'm pleased you've decided to help.
evt/nq/msg_nq340253t.json
0	_j1	Seeker? Yeah, I'm grateful to him.\nIt's thanks to his efforts that my friends\nwere able to return to the City.
1	_j1	Obviously, I'm also thankful to you.
2	_j1	Thinking about all the people who went\nback to the City, I guess it wouldn't be\nstrange to anticipate food shortages...
3	_j1	I like Seeker's plan. And I like its chances\nof coming to fruition even better now that\nyou lot are on the case.
4	_j1	Now there's fewer people around here,\nit's gotten kinda quiet... I bet the City's\njust the opposite, though.
evt/nq/msg_nq340300s.json
0	2	Everyone at Agnus Castle seems busy...
1	5	Right, and there's not as many people\nas there were before...
2	1	I wonder what they're all doing...
3	6	Both Agnians and the Lost Numbers\nlook to be really hurried all the time.
4	2	Yeah... But there hasn't been any major\nstrife yet, at least.
5	4	If anyone knows the ins and outs of\nthe situation, it would be Seeker.\nIt might be a good idea to inquire.
6	3	Hey, good thinking.\nHe'd have a good overview for sure.
evt/nq/msg_nq340301f.json
0	1	Hi, Seeker. Things are looking busy, huh?
1	rj1	They sure are! Oh, not that I'm\ncomplaining or anything.
2	2	What're you doing now?
3	rj1	I'm making preparations for sending off\nprovisions and other goods to the City.
4	6	...Isn't that what you were doing before?\nHave the provisions run out already?
5	Q	Wait, wait, let me guess.\nAggy and Oggy, right?
6	rj1	Yes. You see, the two of them were\npretty keen on getting some extra\nprovisions...
7	Q	I knew something like this would happen.\nThose dingbats think everything'll work out\nso long as there'd food on the table.
8	2	D-dingbats...?
9	Q	Bah... So I was busy with other stuff and\ntold them to handle it. Big mistake.
10	rj1	It's not like I have heaps of time on\nmy hands, either... But since I've already\nsent people to the City, I can't ignore it.
11	rj1	And so, I'm enlisting the entire Castle\npersonnel, up to and including inspectors,\nto try and cope with this somehow.
12	Q	Too nice-natured for your own good,\nSeeker.
13	rj1	I just prepared the ship, but I just got\nword of some problems arising.
14	1	What kind of problems?
15	rj1	In plain words? Some people don't want\nthe goods shipped out, so they've taken\nup arms and are heading for the boat.
16	rj1	Next, some of the goods that were left\nin the prison camp haven't been delivered.
17	rj1	And then, we don't have enough\nether cylinders to keep running\nthe ship back and forth...
18	rj1	A real clustersnuff of a situation, in short.
19	5	Now I get why you need all\nthat manpower...
20	2	If that's all you need, we'll pitch in too.\nLet us handle all those things you just\nmentioned, would that help?
21	rj1	Yes, it would. Thanks very much.\nA lot of our soldiers aren't used to this\nsort of work, so I appreciate your offer.
22	3	A'ight then, let's roll up the old sleeves\nand get cracking.
evt/nq/msg_nq340302f.json
0	5	Will this be enough cylinders now?
1	_j1	They'll do, thanks.\nSorry about all the hassle.
2	4	As for the provisions and supplies...\nI think that should be all of them, too.
3	_j1	It's nice that we're just getting this stuff,\nbut spark, when I think of the trouble\neveryone had to go to, just for this...
4	3	Hey now, it's all for the good of the City.\nYou sure you shouldn't be smiling?
5	_j1	Believe me, I'm doing plenty of that too.\nA real 12-gauge grin.
6	_j1	Anyhow, we're all set here,\nand the boat is ready too...\nGuess I'll go on ahead.
7	_j1	Sorry to add insult to manual labor,\nbut could you report back to Seeker?
8	1	Sure thing, we're on it.
evt/nq/msg_nq340303f.json
0	6	Looks like the ship's shipped out now.
1	rj1	Thanks, I've heard.
2	4	Even Aggy and Oggy should be satisfied\nwhen they see the shipment.
3	rj1	I sure hope so. Now then,\ntime to handle the issues in\nAgnus Castle, I reck-
4	rj1	...Sorry, I'm getting a call.
5	rj10500	Yes? Mhm, yes...
6	rj10700	...What?! Snuff it... Understood.\nI'll send someone straight away.
7	1	What's happened?
8	rj1	That was from some soldiers down\nin the harbor. They said they've lost\ncontact with the ship...
9	2	Oh no...!
10	rj1	I was going to send some troops to\nget a quick idea of the situation...
11	1	It's an emergency, right? We'll go.\nI think it'll be quicker that way.
12	rj1	...Yeah, you're probably right.\nThanks. I'm counting on you.
13	1	Right. Let's get on out there!
evt/nq/msg_nq340351t.json
0	rj1	We've prepared a ship, but there were\nsome problems and it can't leave.
1	rj1	Sorry to trouble you, but may I ask\nyou to lend us your assistance?
evt/nq/msg_nq340352t.json
0	oV	Aggy and Oggy are happy to work,\nso long as they get fed.
1	oV	The ship can't leave, eh?
2	oV	Well then, sorry to say, I think you're up.\nAgain, yeah. I can't go right now, I've got\nother stuff to take care of.
evt/nq/msg_nq340353t.json
0	_j1	Everything's squared away from my side,\nbut the ship still isn't ready to leave.
1	_j1	Nothing I can do but wait, I suppose...
2	_j1	I think we should be good to go if\nwe had another ten ether cylinders.
3		Give Dana the ether cylinders?
4		Yes
5		No
6	_j1	I did my bit over here.\nNo worries, I'm happy\nto wait.
evt/nq/msg_nq340401f.json
0	4	Over there...!
1	_j1	Aw, sorry, you guys...\nLooks like things went sparks-up...
2	Q	Dana! What're you doing lying down?!\nDamn it, who did this...?!
3	1	What...? Dana...!
4	1	Grrh... How did this happen...?
5	5	Over there... Agnian Levnises.
6	1	Yeah... No mistaking it.
7	zj1	Hey, check it out! Looks like\nOuroboros caught wind of us!
8	2	It was you...?
9	3	You took Levnises to raid the shipment?!
10	zj1	"Raid"? I resent that wording.\nWe just did what we had to\nto get our food back.
11	zj1	Or what, you really thought we'd\nhand it over to our mortal enemies?\nYou're dumber than a bale of tent cloth!
12	6	They're not your enemies!
13	zj1	Shut your lying mouth, mudder!\nYou're as bad as the lot of 'em,\na perversion of the natural order!
14	zj1	You're not leaving me any choice here.\nWe'll just have to get rid of you as well.
15	5	Tch... Guess we're doing this, then.
16	zj1	Prepare to die!
evt/nq/msg_nq340402f.json
0	zj1	Guh... We were no match for them,\neven with a Levnis...
1	rj1	Everyone! Are you all right?!
2	rj1	Oh... Oh snuff...
3	zj1	Seeker... Timely entrance, you rat.
4	1	...Yeah, we're fine. But we were too late\nto help Dana and the others...
5	rj1	What did you do...?\nHow could you...?!
6	zj1	You're seriously gonna give me that...?\nYou, with the Internal Affairs background?!
7	zj1	We don't have two potatoes to rub\ntogether ourselves, but here's you,\nhanding over food to prisoners?!
8	zj1	You were perfectly content making the\nprisoners make our food and necessities,\nright up till now!
9	zj1	And what do we care about anyone\noutside of Agnus?! Let 'em all starve,\nI say! What, you wanna argue?!
10	rj1	...Mgh...
11	rj1	Some things are bigger than you or me.\nThings we can't achieve alone. We'll never\nhave understanding without humility.
12	zj1	...What're you yakking on about?
13	rj1	Without cooperation, there can be\nno escape from suffering, not for\nany of us...
14	rj1	Open your eyes! Don't you get it?!
15	rj1	Keeping the City's residents prisoner\nwas the first, fundamental wrong.
16	rj1	Swallowing the Consuls' words whole,\nthat was another. Accepting the fake\nQueen, another one still!
17	rj1	If you can't comprehend, well,\nthat's as may be. However...
18	rj1	Plotting against those who've turned\nover a new leaf will not be tolerated!
19	zj1	"Tolerated"? Listen to yourself!\nI took up arms to protect the Castle!
20	rj1	Oh, spare me. You attacked and\nkilled an innocent bystander...
21	rj1	If you don't know how to be ashamed,\nyou will have to be taught.
22	rj1	Take them away.
23	zj1	Wha-?! Seeker, you worthless mudder!\nWhat gives you the right?! Oi, face me-!
24	rj1	What a wretched turn of events.\nI should have foreseen this...
25	1	You didn't cause this.
26	rj1	...Not only will we fail to deliver on the\npromised shipment, now the passengers\nare dead too.
27	rj1	I should be ashamed of myself.
28	5	Now ain't the time for the blame game.\nWe gotta do what we gotta do.
29	rj1	You're right. I'll retrieve the goods\nand head back.
30	rj1	Thank you very much for your\ncooperation, everyone.
31	1	That's quite all right...
32	Q	...Damn you, dying in a place like this.
33	1	Hey, Ghondor... Are you OK?
34	Q	Dana was a bit of a free spirit,\nbut she never once failed to do\nwhatever she took on.
35	Q	If she'd just gone back with Cory and\nthe others, she would've been fine...
36	Q	...The least we can do is take care\nof her effects. Let's go back.
37	6	...Why'd things turn out like this...?
38	2	I know...\nWe'll have to notify Ghondor\nof Dana's passing.
39	rj1	I'll carry back her personal effects.
40	rj1	...I'd like to hand them over to Ghondor\npersonally, and tell her of what happened.
41	1	In that case, why don't we go with you?
42	rj1	Ah, I'm sorry... I feel this is something\nI have to take care of myself.
43	rj1	I don't want to make you all\ncarry my failure like that.
44	rj1	...Well then, I'll go on ahead.\nI'm really sorry for causing you so\nmuch trouble, and that for nothing...
45	6	Think it'll be OK...?
46	1	With Seeker and Ghondor?\nYeah, I'm sure it will...
47	3	Yeah... No matter her behavior,\nGhondor's not unreasonable.
48	3	Much as we might want to, I don't think\nthere's anything for us to do there.
49	1	Yeah... Better leave it to Seeker,\nlike he wanted.
evt/nq/msg_nq340451t.json
0	rj1	We've lost contact with the Agnus ship.\nSomeone needs to go and investigate...
evt/nq/msg_nq340500s.json
0	3	So, we've heard there're some people\nlocked up, but nothing about the whys\nor hows...
1	4	...Being put into prison for\nviolations of military discipline\nis not unheard of, I suppose.
2	2	People were saying they're\npretty tough, as well...
3	6	Hey Ghondor, do you know anything?
4	Q	Ah yeah, some Agnian soldiers, apparently.\nWay I hear it, Taion's basically got it. Put\nin the brig for some discipline thinger.
5	Q	Meant to be right clever, and rowdy too.\nThat's about all I've heard.
6	4	Supposedly it's all under security's\npurview, but I don't know much more.
7	1	Is there any point to locking them up\nunder the current circumstances...?
8	5	Won't know unless we ask security.
9	2	Would be nice to get some extra hands\nto help around the Castle and City...
evt/nq/msg_nq340501f.json
0	2	Hey, could we talk to you for a minute?
1	vj1	Sure thing, what's up?
2	2	We heard you've got Agnian soldiers\nlocked up here, so-
3	vj1	Oh sparks... Really, even you've heard?!\nGahhh, give me a break...
4	3	Wow, sounds like that struck a nerve...
5	vj1	Oh, you're joking now, but just wait\ntill you've heard the story! I'm at\nthe end of my tether, I tell ya!
6	vj1	I mean, look, I agree with Seeker's thinking,\nand I wanna work together with the City,\nreally I do.
7	vj1	But the people they lock up for violating\nregulations have done some pretty\nheinous stuff in the past.
8	vj1	Take this Tohma guy, old pals with\na chick called Xera, then add in this\nhothead Jhodor in the mix...
9	vj1	Now the three of 'em have some\nkinda understanding. Cahoots o'clock.\nI'm telling you, thick as thieves!
10	4	What are you suggesting...?\nYou think when they're let out,\nthey'll get up to some high jinks?
11	vj1	High jinks, huh...? Well, if it was just\n"high jinks", I think we could consider\nourselves lucky.
12	vj1	To be honest with you, I'm kinda\nshocked they haven't been sent\nfor the chop already...
13	vj1	If we don't ever let them out, then\nmaybe it'd have been better to just\ndo that and be done with it...
14	2	"Getting the chop"...? You mean execution?\nWhat you're saying is, you think what they\ndid is enough to deserve *that*?
15	4	And what does Seeker have to say?
16	vj1	"I'm leaving their treatment\nto your discretion."
17	vj1	"Discretion"?!?! My arse!\nLike, tell me what to do?!\nYou! Utter! Shitbird!!!
18	vj1	Phew, sorry, had to get it off my chest.\nSo anyway, you wanna see 'em?
19	3	Erm... If they're really so\nirredeemable, aren't they\ngonna take a pop at us?
20	vj1	I mean, they're still in a cell, right?\nNot exactly made of sticks.\nOK, come along, I'll introduce ya.
21	wj1	...Hrmgh? What's this?\nTee tie toe tighter, I smell the\nsmell of a strong fighter...
22	5	So that's the big baddie\nyou were talking about?
23	vj1	That's right. He's the main offender.
24	wj1	You come to break us out?\nOr cut our throats? I'll tell ya though,\nit pays to be on our good side.
25	vj1	I'm still making my mind up, actually!\nDon't go forcing my hand, all right?
26	wj1	And you, you're the lot that liberated\nthe Castle, aren't you? C'mon, let's\nhave a square go, you and us.
27	3	Beg your pardon?!
28	wj1	If we win, you cut us loose.\n...And before you go misinterpreting that,\nI don't mean we'll go on a killing spree.
29	wj1	Xera's my best and oldest friend, you see.\nAnd Jhodor, well, I met him here, on the\ninside, but I like the cut of his jib.
30	wj1	So I think we'd like to taste the air outside,\none day again, all three of us together.\n...Well, if we win, that is.
31	1	And what if we win?
32	wj1	Your choice, I suppose. Keep us jailed\ntill we die, make us follow you around...\nWhatever you decide, we'll go along with.
33	2	Uhmm... That doesn't make it any easier...
34	3	Wait wait, aren't they hardened criminals?\nI don't feel qualified to pass judgment on\nthem just like that...
35	vj1	It's fine, it's fine. You're more qualified\nthan me, that's for sparking certain.
36	wj1	There we go, sounds like a deal to me.\nC'mon, let's get to the fisticuffs already!
37	6	What should we do...?
38	vj1	All right there Feris, you pipe down\nand play nice until these good people\nfigure out what to do.
39	wj1	Sounds good to me.\nJust don't keep me\nwaiting too long.
evt/nq/msg_nq340502t.json
0	vj1	So, what are we doing?\nYou're gonna fight them or what?
1		Do you want to fight them?
2		Ask about the prisoners
3	vj1	They've been here a while now,\nall three of them.
4	vj1	It's not like they can just walk out,\nor anything, but during working hours\nthey're usually together.
5	vj1	They're a real thorn in my side, though,\nso I seriously want them gone, in the worst\npossible way.
6		All right, let's fight
7	vj1	Right you are. Hope you'll make it quick.
8		Need time to think
9	vj1	Roger that. I really hope you'll\ntake care of it soon though.
evt/nq/msg_nq340503f.json
0	wj1	Ah, I see you've made your minds up!
1	xj1	Ohh, I've been waiting for this.
2	yj1	I was already excited before, but now I\nsee we got some decent opponents, I gotta\nsay my day's getting better and better!
3	5	Wait wait wait! You're already out,\nand you still wanna fight?!
4	wj1	We're a team, we are!\nSay whatever you like, but everything\nwe do now, we do it together!
5	3	Well, guess there's nothing for it.\nWho's ready to mess up some fools?
6	yj1	You're from that City or whatever?\nLet's see what you're made of!
7	xj1	They've got a real killer on their side.\nGreat, I won't have to hold back then!
8	wj1	Onwards!!!
evt/nq/msg_nq340504f.json
0	xj1	Oof... We already done...?\nNot too shabby, taking us all on...
1	wj1	We did our best, but it wasn't enough...\nWhat a display of strength...
2	yj1	And Ouroboros, as I live and breathe...\nA sight I never thought I'd see!
3		
4		
5		
6	5	So, now you've had your fight.\nFeeling any better?
7	wj1	...Oh yes! Very much so!\nAnd therefore! We three\nwill follow you anywhere!
8	3	Uhh, pardon? What're we supposed\nto do with that kind of statement?
9	xj1	Well, look. We can't exactly go back to\nour original jobs at this point, can we?
10	vj1	Yes, obviously, considering\nwhat you've done...
11	4	How about we have them join\nInternal Affairs' security team\nas guards or wardens?
12	vj1	Whuh?!
13	4	If they work under your supervision,\nwe'll hear about it if they misbehave...\nThen we'll be able to step in again.
14	wj1	Now we're talking! I'm in!
15	vj1	No, c'mon, please, get back out... Why do\nthey have to be my responsibility again?!
16	4	Then make them Seeker's personal detail\nor something. They'll report to you, but\nhe'll be the one to mostly deal with them.
17	3	Wow, you seriously think of everything...
18	vj1	Huh... Yeah, OK, I guess that'd work...?
19	yj1	All right, then it's settled!\nHear that? From now on,\nwe're professional bodyguards!
20	vj1	...I don't know why, but I feel\nlike I got played good there.
21	wj1	Ah, stop your fretting.\nThere won't be any problems,\nnot with us on the job!
22	vj1	Ugh... I can feel an ulcer forming...
evt/nq/msg_nq340505f.json
0	vj1	Uhm, say... You really think it's\nthe right choice, letting them walk...?
1	4	I don't foresee any particular problems.
2	1	They'll be working for the good\nof the Castle now, right?
3	wj1	Tch... I really wanted to fight you guys,\nbut if it means I get to leave this place,\nthen I guess I'll settle.
4	xj1	Same here...\nAnything's better than rotting in jail.
5	yj1	Right. Can't say I'm really digging the\njail vibe too much.
6	vj1	Uhm, say... Are you really-really sure?\nI don't want this coming back on me, OK?
7	5	If they start going nuts, we'll handle it.\nRelax.
8	4	Seeker did leave it to your discretion.\nIf anything, the responsibility is his.
9	vj1	...Hey, that's a good point.\nThey were in my custody, but\nSeeker's the one in charge.
10	vj1	Well, in that case, why don't we make 'em\nhis bodyguards or something?
11	4	Hmm. That's not a bad plan at all.\nThey would perform well as a personal\nsecurity detail for someone of his position.
12	vj1	Right, you've heard him! Get outta here,\nand don't darken my doorstep again.\nAhhh, that's a weight off my chest!
13	3	...And straight onto Seeker's, innit...
14	wj1	All right, friends!\nTime to get to work!
evt/nq/msg_nq340600s.json
0	5	That's some heavy kinda atmosphere\nout there right now, huh?
1	4	There was talk of people being\ncalled up to the City, it seems.
2	6	Sounds like what happened with Dana's\ngetting out there... Are they gonna end\nup being blamed for that?
3	3	I can see this lot getting rowdy and\nfighting back if it shakes out like that.
4	Q	Yeah... I wonder.
5	3	Hey! I can see "I know something I'm not\nletting on" plastered all over your face!
6	Q	I...can't say anything, sorry. Just trust me\nthat nothing bad's gonna happen, all right?
7	2	...Yeah, I don't think there'll be\nany fighting, either.
8	2	Seeker and Ghondor are around. I think\neveryone understands that fighting will\nonly lead to bitterness and tragedy.
9	Q	You sure about that?\nI happen to be pretty partial\nto a good dust-up, myself.
10	3	Give it a rest, would you?!\nYou're stressing me out!
11	1	Maybe the fastest way to get a good idea\nof the situation would be to go and speak\nto Seeker directly.
12	2	Yeah, let's do that.
evt/nq/msg_nq340601f.json
0	Q	Hey, Seeker.
1	rj1	Ah, Ghondor! And you didn't come alone.
2	5	You guys heading for the City, right?
3	rj1	Yeah. A little while after you handled\nthose rebels, we got a message through\nfrom the City.
4	rj1	It was an invite to the City, addressed to\na few of us Agnians from the Castle.
5	1	An invitation? That must set your mind at\nease a bit. I mean, you can trust that you\nwon't be walking into anything dangerous.
6	rj1	Honestly, I don't know. I dropped the ball\npretty badly, not least by allowing Dana\nand the others to be murdered...
7	3	That wasn't your fault!
8	rj1	No, I deserve to take the fall for that,\nwithout question.
9	rj1	It's possible that I'm being called out\nprecisely to answer for it, as a\nrepresentative of the Castle.
10	vj1	Uhm... You don't actually think they'd\nget us over there just to off us, do you?
11	Q	Heh. You did kinda bring this on\nyourselves. You might well have to\nargue for your lives, who knows.
12	vj1	Ah... I don't love the sound of that...
13	4	Invite you in, then attack. Such simplistic\nstrategies are not their hallmark.
14	4	If it did develop into a conflict, it would\nbe a futile waste of battle resources.
15	rj1	Well, I'm here. So if it does get to a scrap,\nyou've nothing to worry about.
16	vj1	You...? But you're a hopeless fighter!\nNo use at all!
17	rj1	W-well... I mean... I can catch\na bullet for you at least.
18	vj1	If I let that happen, then they'd have my\nguts for garters here, you can count on it.
19	1	Well, if that's the way it is, then maybe we\nshould go along with you? We can at least\nargue on your behalf.
20	ye1	Ah, the idea of being able to be present in\nthe City... It fills me up with such emotion!
21	5	Huh? You're going to come along as well?
22	ye1	Why, of course! Going to the City is my\ngreatest ambition! My ultimate goal!
23	3	OK, well, no guarantees we'll be able to\nkeep you safe if shit hits the fan, aight?
24	ye1	My ambition would be unchanged even if\nI was walking into a forest of swords and\na shower of bullets, have no fear!
25	Q	Ah, hang it... Whatever. If you got called\nup, then just go, OK?
26	vj1	Well, I guess we'll need to make sure\nSeeker gets decent protection then. Maybe\nwe can recruit some skilled Agnians?
27	rj1	In any case, there's no turning back time,\nand what will be, will be. We will simply\nhave to think on our feet.
28	vj1	I imagine it'll be fine, so long as his\ncuriosity doesn't get the better of him.\n...Welp, guess we're doing this...
29	rj1	Right then, let's rendezvous at\nFarview Cape. We'll meet there\nonce we make our preparations.
30	rj1	I'll be counting on you all.
31	1	Understood. We won't let you down.
evt/nq/msg_nq340602t.json
0	hk1	OK, I've got the lowdown already.\nWord is, Seeker and the others will\narrive any moment now.
1	hk1	You can board early if you like.\nHow about it? Wanna climb on?
2		What do you want to do?
3		Board the aircraft.
4	hk1	Cool. Come aboard!
5		We still need to do a few things...
6	hk1	Let me know when you're all set!
7		You can't use this now, as the City is\nunder attack. Finish Sena's side story\nfirst. (Skip travel to City is allowed.)
evt/nq/msg_nq340605f.json
0	rj1	S-so this is...the City...?
1	vj1	Hard to believe a place like this exists...
2	ye1	This is...\nHow can it even be put into words...?
3	tk1	Yo! You made it!
4	Q	One hell of a welcome party...\nYou guys must've been bored\nout your skulls!
5	il1	That's not the kind of thing you're\nsupposed to say in front of guests,\nGhondor!
6	rj1	Noah... Uhm...
7	il1	Huh, what's up? You've never seen\nan old crone like me before?
8	rj1	Ah... Yes, I mean... No, I didn't, I...\nSo you're a..."crone"?
9	il1	Hahaha! What a wonderful reaction...
10	tk1	That's enough talking on our feet, don't\nyou think? Maybe we should continue\nsomewhere a little more comfortable?
11	il1	Yes, that's a good suggestion.\nLet's do that!
12	jW1	It's been so long since we've\nseen the City...
13	kW1	M'lady, let's go!
14	il1	Wait a moment. I'd appreciate it if you'd\naccompany me.
15	jW1	What is it? Is there something you\nneed to tell us about?
16	il1	Indeed, there is! It seems you're in need of\na good talking-to about your sloppy work!
17	kW1	Wh-what...? M-m'lady, don't you have\nsomething to say about this?
18	Q	Don't look at me.
19	il1	You've been making a real nuisance of\nyourselves out there, haven't you!
20	3	That's what you get for winding everyone\nup by begging for food, eh?
21	tk1	I suppose it falls to me look after our\nguests! Please, come this way...
22	rj1	Y-yes... Thank you very much!
23	tk1	I would've liked for you to have met the\nboss, but she's busy with something else\nright now.
24	rj1	No, really... This kind of welcome is more\nthan enough!
25	vj1	For sure. We were worried that the\nwelcome was going to be more in the\norder of a knuckle sandwich buffet.
26	Zl1	Haha... That's funny.
27	il1	What happened was truly unfortunate, but\nGhondor has already told us that it wasn't\ndue to any negligence on your part.
28	rj1	Huh?
29	3	What? Ghondor, you've been getting us\nscared and spooked this whole time, while\nworking a back channel with her...?
30	Q	Honestly, we didn't have good in-roads\nwith the Agnus crowd, so we figured it'd\nbe easier to sort things out face-to-face.
31	il1	Yes... She's right. We owe you thanks.\nLet's go together now, and I will gift\nyou the secrets of our technology.
32	rj1	Thank you... We'll do everything we can,\nto make this relationship stronger.
33	tk1	Come on mate, enough of all this\nformal talk. Why don't you relax\nand take a look around?
34	rj1	Really? You don't mind?
35	tk1	Certainly not. We've cleared it with the\nboss already. Well, catch you later!
36	1	Yes, thank you very much!\nOK then, why don't we take\na little walk around?
evt/nq/msg_nq340606f.json
0	rj1	The more you look, the more amazing this\nplace gets.
1	ye1	Yes! In such surroundings, I can scarcely\ncontain my wonder!
2	vj1	Uh... If you say so...
3	vj1	I'm surprised how calm you are, though.\nAren't you at least happy about finding\na little bit of resolution here?
4	rj1	Do I look calm? I've gotten quite\nworked up about the whole thing.\nI'm still shaking with excitement now!
5	vj1	Maybe on the inside... Anyway, after we\nwere liberated, you had plenty of\nmisgivings to begin with, right?
6	rj1	I thought doing what I was told and doing\nthe right thing were the same...
7	rj1	That staying on that path until it was time\nfor Homecoming was the only and right\nway to live.
8	5	I mean...we all thought that way, right?
9	rj1	But after we were liberated, we were free.\nWe understood then that there were other\nthings we could do with our lives.
10	rj1	Something made us want to know the\nthings that we didn't, and do the things\nthat we couldn't do.
11	rj1	Everyone's been saying lately that\nI seem like a different person.
12	rj1	But, I also think this feeling is something\nthat's been dormant in me the whole time.\nSo I feel like I've arrived at the real me...
13	vj1	...You sure have.\nWeirdo.
14	3	That's one way to sum it up...
15	vj1	Hey now, I'm being 100% factual.\nCan't deny he's weird! Now I didn't\nsay if it's a good weird, or bad...
16	ye1	Yes yes, that's all well and good,\nbut there is more to see still!\nCome, let's hurry on!
17	_l1	Owowow...
18	rj1	Ah, I'm sorry... Are you OK?
19	_l1	I'm fine... It was my fault anyway, sorry.
20	rj1	Please... It's fine.
21	_l1	Are you all from...the outside?
22	rj1	The outside...? Yes, I suppose we are.\nWe came from Agnus Castle.
23	_l1	Wow, really...?
24	Wm1	Stop right there! Don't touch her!
25	1	Huh?
26	Q	What...? We're just minding our business\nhere. What's your beef?
27	Wm1	Shut it! Outsiders are filthy barbarians,\nevery last one of 'em. That's what my dad\ntold me!
28	wj1	He might be small, but he's got a big\nattitude, huh.
29	Wm1	Gah... Don't say that! Don't treat me like\nan idiot just because I'm a kid!
30	wj1	A "kid"... I'm not sure I even know what\nthat means. We're from Agnus, yeah?
31	3	C'mon, stop messing with 'em...
32	wj1	These little ones make me think of Nopon,\nsomehow. They're small, but some of them\nhave big mouths, too.
33	3	Yeah, well, whatever.\nI've had my fill of it for now, I think.
34	rj1	You look like you're in a hurry. Were you\nin the middle of something there?
35	Wm1	What... I wouldn't tell you if I was!
36	_l1	Ah...uhm... We were looking for something\nthat got lost.
37	Wm1	Coralie! Don't tell them!
38	rj1	Something lost, you say...?\nWhat kind of thing?
39	_l1	We're looking for my ring.\nAbout so big...
40	1	Where did you drop it?
41	Wm1	We don't know. That's why we're looking\nfor it. Duh!
42	_l1	That's right...
43	rj1	Well, why don't I help you then? I mean,\nI don't know the surroundings all that well,\nbut I could still...
44	vj1	Huh...? Well, if it's just a little treasure\nhunt, then I suppose I can join in too...
45	ye1	I will offer support too, paltry though it\nmay be!

47	_l1	Thank you guys so much!

evt/nq/msg_nq340607f.json
0	_l1	Ah! That's it!
1	1	Looks like we found what\nwe were looking for.
2	_l1	Thank you so much for helping me find it!
3	rj1	Ah, we didn't do anything, really.\nIt was Noah and the others that found it.
4	Wm1	O-oh, yeah... Hey, that's right!\nYou weren't any help at all, were you?!
5	Q	You don't miss an opportunity to butt\nheads with the big boys, do you?
6	_l1	So you're all from the outside...?
7	rj1	Huh? Well, yes! I probably already\nmentioned it, but I'm from Agnus Castle.
8	_l1	In about ten years or so, I want to go\noutside and to a bunch of outside places\ntoo!
9	rj1	Ten...years...?
10	vj1	Ten years is a long time...
11	_l1	Will I be able to see you\nwhen I come to this Castle place?
12	_l1	I guess it's still a long way off. But I'm\ngoing to go to the Castle! So I can see\nyou then, can't I? Please!
13	rj1	...Why... Yes, of course.\nI'll be waiting for you there.
14	_l1	Yay! So I'll see you again! Bye bye!
15	rj1	...
16	Q	Hey, Seeker. You're not in\na rush or anything, right?
17	rj1	Huh? Ah...yes, sure...
18	Q	There are still a few places to check out in\nthe City. We should have a walk round\ninstead of just standing about.
19	rj1	What do you...
20	vj1	Wow, Ghondor...\nDidn't realize you actually cared.
21	Q	I actually really don't. I just don't want us\nblocking the road and stopping traffic with\nthose glum looks on your faces.
22	1	Why don't we just keep strolling\nwherever your fancy takes you?
23	rj1	Yes, that makes sense.\nLet's walk around a bit more, then.
evt/nq/msg_nq340608f.json
0	rj1	...What is this place...?
1	Q	Duh? It's a bookshop, obviously.
2	rj1	A "book"..."shop"...?
3	Q	A place to sell books, mate. Keep up.\nWanna try reading one? They won't mind,\nso long as you don't take it without paying.
4	Q	Look, I'm not gonna hold your hand here.\nThat one's got some writing, go look.
5	rj1	R-really...? OK... What do we have here...?
6	vj1	Anything interesting?
7	rj1	Oh...\nThis is quite intellectually stimulating...
8	vj1	Huh?
9	rj1	The more I read, the more I understand\nabout things that were strange and frankly\nunbelievable to me before...
10	rj1	...Yes, they've got amazing things here in\nthe City, ones I could never have imagined!
11	vj1	Uh, you OK there buddy?\nYou've gone all weird...
12	3	Uhm, I'm not so sure...\nMaybe this is actually baseline Seeker.
13	6	Hard to tell...
14	rj1	I'm sorry... I don't know what's coming\nover me...
15	rj1	But we must...take each by the hand,\nand go into the future together!
16	ye1	Ah, the stimulus of a new, hitherto\nunknown culture...\nIt's set something off in him.
17	rj1	Agnus, Keves... Distinctions that seemed\nimmutable. But we overcame them!
18	1	That's the idea. We can combine our\npowers and find a new path to walk.
19	rj1	Ghondor... You too!
20	Q	Hmph. Well, if you dags are serious about\nthis stuff, sure, you got my blessing.
21	Q	But now you know about the City,\nwe can't afford to let you bail, all right?\nHope we've got an understanding.
22	rj1	Yes, of course! We'll plot a straight path\ninto the future, without fleeing, or hiding\nfrom anything at all!

3	Zg1	If I don't restock soon, there might not be\nenough feed for all my precious darlings...
4	Zg1	I've never seen so much feed in one place!\nI really appreciate your help!

9	Zg1	How time flies!

0	Zg1	Thank you very much!\nAll my sweeties can now stuff\ntheir little bellies nice and full.
1	Zg1	All that's left now is to select the\nbig Armus and Arduns one by one\nand pair them together...
2	Zg1	The day after it rains, a little one\nshould be born.
3	2	And the Armus and Arduns you\npair up need to be compatible\nwith each other as well, right?
4	Zg1	Absolutely. I'd like to ask for your advice\nagain if you don't mind?
5		Which pairing should we choose?
6		Assertive Armu & Indulgent Ardun
7	4	Why don't we pair an assertive Armu\nwith an indulgent Ardun?
8	3	Yeah, neither one has worries that'd\ndrag down the other. Their positive traits\nwould probably gel well with each other.
9	Zg1	Hee hee, sounds like their offspring will\ngrow up to be a lively little creature!
10		Greedy Armu & Innocent Ardun
11	4	How about putting the innocent Ardun\nwith the greedy Armu?
12	3	Yeah, could work. That way, they\ncan allow each other to take things\nat their own pace.
13	Zg1	Great idea! There won't be any conflict\ngoing on between these two, and that can\nonly be a good thing.
14		Assertive Armu & Innocent Ardun
15	3	What about the innocent Ardun\nand the assertive Armu?
16	4	I don't think it's a bad pairing at all.\nIt certainly won't be lacking for liveliness.
17	Zg1	It's important for them both to have\na bit of spice in their lives.
18		Greedy Armu & Indulgent Ardun
19	3	How about we pair the indulgent Ardun\nand the greedy Armu?
20	4	It would result in a great desire for\nsleeping and eating, but maybe that would\nactually contribute to their well-being.
21	Zg1	It's absolutely crucial to have your beauty\nsleep and be well fed, after all!
22		Serene Armu & Considerate Ardun
23	6	What do you think about pairing the\nconsiderate Ardun with the serene Armu?
24	5	That pairing sure don't lack\nbroad-mindedness.
25	Zg1	And I'm sure they'd always have\na smile on their faces.
26		Naughty Armu & Gallant Ardun
27	6	Maybe a gallant Ardun and\na naughty Armu could work well?
28	5	I think they could, you know. They can\nmake up for each other's weaknesses.
29	Zg1	I think that would be a wonderful pairing!
30		Serene Armu & Gallant Ardun
31	5	Why don't we put a gallant Ardun\ntogether with a serene Armu?
32	6	Sounds good to me. I get the feeling they'd\nget on really well with each other.
33	Zg1	The gallant Ardun can always come to the\nserene Armu's rescue whenever need be.\nI approve!
34		Naughty Armu & Considerate Ardun
35	5	What about pairing the considerate\nArdun with the naughty Armu?
36	6	You can bet every day would be a laugh\nand a half with those two together. They\nboth sound pretty open-minded!
37	Zg1	I certainly don't mind laughter-filled days.
38		Naughty Armu & Brawny Ardun
39	6	What do you say to pairing the brawny\nArdun and the naughty Armu?
40	5	The brawny guy's got some serious\npresence. It'd help to make sure the\nnaughty Armu behaves.
41	Zg1	I feel the same way, too.
42		Serene Armu & Brawny Ardun
43	5	How about you pair the brawny Ardun\nwith the serene Armu?
44	6	I'm sure the brawny Ardun would keep\nthe serene Armu nice and safe! Or any\nother Armu, in fact!
45	Zg1	Definitely. That little Ardun has a keen\nsense of responsibility, after all.
46		Shy Armu & Sensible Ardun
47	1	Perhaps the sensible Ardun and the shy\nArmu would make for a good pair?
48	2	I'm sure they could get on really well.\nThey remind me of what Sena and Taion\nwere like a long time ago.
49	Zg1	You really think so? Then, I'm sure I'll\nhave nothing to worry about.
50		One-Track Armu & Gentle Ardun
51	1	How does pairing the gentle Ardun with\nthe one-track Armu sound to you?
52	2	The single-mindedness of the Armu\nmeans it'd do everything for the Ardun,\nwhich it would be more than receptive to.
53	Zg1	Sounds like a suitable pairing to me!
54		Shy Armu & Gentle Ardun
55	2	We could pair the gentle Ardun\nwith the shy Armu if you want?
56	1	They'd be a very relaxed, calm pairing,\nand that can only be a good thing for the\nshy Armu, in my opinion.
57	Zg1	It definitely is important for the shy little\none to feel at ease, that's for certain.
58		One-Track Armu & Sensible Ardun
59	2	The sensible Ardun and the one-track\nArmu could work well as a pair.
60	1	One-track personalities always worry\ntoo much about things. The sensible Ardun\ncould help ease its mind when it's worried.
61	Zg1	There's nothing like knowing you have a\nfriend who has your back, is there?
62		Dainty Armu & Impatient Ardun
63	2	The impatient Ardun could work well\nwith the dainty Armu, don't you think?
64	6	Because opposites attract, right?\nYeah, it'd be a breath of fresh air\nfor the both of them!
65	Zg1	They would learn something new\nevery day. I think this pairing might\njust be worth a shot.
66		Fluffy Armu & Adamant Ardun
67	2	How about pairing the adamant\nArdun and the fluffy Armu?
68	6	Hard agree, here! The fluffy Armu could\nreally help to loosen that Ardun up!
69	Zg1	That would certainly be a\ngood thing for the Ardun!
70		Dainty Armu & Adamant Ardun
71	6	What if we paired up the adamant\nArdun with the dainty Armu?
72	2	They'd probably need a bit of time to\nwarm to each other, but after that, I'm\nsure they'd be a great pairing, no?
73	Zg1	I think they could definitely get used to\neach other, and really become the best\nof friends.
74		Fluffy Armu & Impatient Ardun
75	6	The impatient Ardun could pair up well\nwith the fluffy Armu, wouldn't you say?
76	2	Being next to a complete opposite would\nlikely make every day interesting for the\nboth of them.
77	Zg1	They'd be a stimulating pairing, certainly.
78		Pensive Armu & Serious Ardun
79	4	A serious Ardun and a pensive Armu\ncould work well. What do you say?
80	5	Yeah, why not? I reckon their personalities\nwould really balance each other out.
81	Zg1	Like Aya and Tallow, right? I approve!
82		Flirty Armu & Cool Ardun
83	4	Maybe the cool Ardun and the flirty Armu\ncould make for a good pairing?
84	5	Now that's a pairing and a half...\nIt'll work great, long as the Ardun\ndoesn't get too agitated...
85	Zg1	That Armu's an devilish one, isn't she?\nI'm sure the Ardun will take a liking to her.
86		Pensive Armu & Cool Ardun
87	5	The cool Ardun and the pensive Armu\ncould be a good pair. How about it?
88	4	As long as the Armu doesn't end up\nseeing the Ardun too often in its dreams,\nwe won't have anything to worry about.
89	Zg1	Let's see how they get on, then.
90		Flirty Armu & Serious Ardun
91	5	Perhaps the serious Ardun and the flirty\nArmu could work well together?
92	4	That's bound to be a fiery pairing...\nThough at least we can be sure the Ardun\nwouldn't betray the Armu.
93	Zg1	Yes, that Ardun's an honest one.\nI'm sure they'll be just fine together.
94		Loner Armu & Excitable Ardun
95	3	We could try putting the excitable Ardun\ntogether with the loner Armu?
96	1	That Ardun's liveliness is sure to make life\nmore fun for the Armu, I can bet.
97	Zg1	That Ardun's such a nice, little darling.\nThough it can get a little carried away at\ntimes...
98		Gourmet Armu & Cleanly Ardun
99	3	How about we pair the cleanly Ardun\nwith the gourmet Armu?
100	1	It's not a pairing I could've ever imagined.\nThe Ardun should be fine, as long as the\nArmu doesn't leave its food everywhere...
101	Zg1	That Armu knows its manners, so there's\nno need to worry about that. I'm sure\nthey'll be a great pairing.
102		Loner Armu & Cleanly Ardun
103	1	Maybe the cleanly Ardun and the loner\nArmu can work well together?
104	3	They look like they'd have similar hobbies.\nBet they'd be good friends after doing\na joint clean together.
105	Zg1	I mean, it's my job to clean the place...but\nI wouldn't mind having less cleaning to do!\nI'll try teaching them a thing or two!
106		Gourmet Armu & Excitable Ardun
107	1	How about putting the gourmet Armu\nand the excitable Ardun together?
108	3	They'd make for one gluttonous pairing,\nthat's for sure... Still, you've gotta eat well\nto live well.
109	Zg1	The bigger they are, the tastier the milk,\nso I say let them eat everything they can\nfit in their bellies!
110	Zg1	In that case, I guess we'll go with\nthe pairing you suggested...
111		Go with this pairing?
112		Yes
113		Choose again
114	Zg1	Thank you so much! Then I think\nwe've found our pairing!
115	3	Now we just have to wait for rain, right?
116	5	Maybe we can turn to that rain cloud-\nsummoning Nopon, then, if it comes\nto that...
117	6	Perhaps we could ask Pitapata to summon\nsome rain if we really need to?
118	2	Let's circle back when it's rained.
119	Zg1	OK! We'll be waiting!
evt/nq/msg_nq990304f.json
0	Zg1	A new baby Armu is born!
1	Zg1	It's so small, yet so clearly an Armu.\nIt's a fascinating phenomenon, isn't it?
2	Zg1	This new baby really is a lively one!
3	Zg1	I've been noticing lately that\nmy Armus haven't been able\nto keep their eyes off me.
4	Zg1	They must be able to recognize me now.\nAs long as I diligently look after them,\nthey'll reward me with delicious milk.
5	Zg1	I really want to show my darlings just\nhow thankful I am to them.
6	Zg1	Have a look! The most adorable little\nArmu was just born!
7	Zg1	These little guys are so adorable that\nsometimes, I wish I could just be by\ntheir side forever and ever...
8	Zg1	And you know what? I think they might\njust feel the same way...
9	Zg1	...
10	Zg1	...Oh! Sorry about that! I was just gazing\nat another newborn Armu.
11	6	...Are you doing OK, Tussore?\nYou don't look so well...
12	Zg1	...I've been having nightmares\nlately, you see.
13	Zg1	In them, I let my Armus die because\nI didn't look after them well enough.
14	6	Huh?! But why would you have\na nightmare like that?
15	Zg1	I guess...it's because my darlings\nare so precious to me.
16	Zg1	I've come to understand that they've\nbasically put their lives in my hands...
17	Zg1	That's why I want to see if there's\nanything I can do for them in return.
18	Zg1	There's our new addition to the family! I\nhope it'll let me raise it without too much\nmischief...
19	2	It's great to see you looking bright and\ncheerful again, Tussore.
20	Zg1	Sorry about what happened earlier.
21	Zg1	My darlings were so worried about me,\nthey were even offering to share their\nfood with me...
22	Zg1	It was like they were telling me I have\ntake proper care of myself.
23	Zg1	And it's thanks to them that I'm doing\nA-OK now!

0	Zg1	Oh, it's you guys!
1	3	Hold on now. I swear there're less Armus\nhere compared to the last time we were\naround.
2	Zg1	Well, you see, some of my darlings have\nescaped the farm... Goo's currently on the\nlookout for them.
3	ag1	Found, safe and sound!
4	ag1	Nandun followed Armu scent for\nGoogoo. Did Googoo huge favor.
5	Zg1	Welcome back home, my darlings! Oooh,\nI was so, so worried you'd got yourselves\nhurt!
6	Zg1	Thank you so much, Nandun.
7	4	...This brings up far too many questions...
8	Zg1	Nandun here is the most incredible creature.\nHe can understand what I'm saying!
9	5	Yeah, I mean, that's deffo cool and all,\nbut what I wanna know is how he got\nto be so shiny.
10	Zg1	Oh yeah. It happened when the rain stopped.\nHe molted and revealed a shiny new layer of-
11	Zg106Xg10	You have to run, Tussore! Some nasty\nlooking monster's coming your way!
12	Zg107Zg10	Mikaela?
13	3	Sparks!
14	2	Tussore, take the Armus with you!
15	Zg1	Got it!
16	Zg1	Come on, my darlings, this way!
17	Zg1	Ah!
18	Xg1	Now, you listen to me, you big oaf!
19	Xg1	Colony Mu...! Is not your feeding ground!
20	Xg1	Argh, this monster's no joke...
21	Xg1	N-Nandun?
22	Zg1	You're going to...fight alongside her?
23	ag1	"Must protect friends", Nandun seem to say.
24	5	Hahah! Well said, Ard-man!
25	4	It's got nowhere to run now.
26	Xg1	We'll take it down, Tussore.\nLet's do this, Nandun!
27	Zg1	OK...
28	Zg1	We'll... We'll make it, together!
29	O	We'll make it! Together!!!

1	Zg1	Me too...
2	Zg1	...Were you worried about me, boy?\nThanks for caring about me.
3	Zg1	Heh heh. It really does feel like you\nunderstand what I'm saying.
4	Zg1	Oh? What's wrong?
5	ag1	Maybe Nandun say he want protect\nfarm together with Tussore.
6	Xg1	You understand what Nandun said?!
7	ag1	Less or more, mostly.
8	ag1	Feels like Nandun think Tussore great,\nbig friend.
9	Zg1	His friend...
10	5	Gotta hand it to that golden Ardun,\nthough. Pretty sure I ain't heard of any\nArdun that can chat to people before.
11	5	...Huh?
12	3	I bet animals don't take a liking to\nyou usually, huh?
13	5	I-I'm good with animals, I swear!\nThat was just a one-off event!
14	2	I guess the trust Nandun has with Tussore\nmust be something really special.
15	6	He's showing that he really cares about\nher, I'm sure.
16	Zg1	Is that right...?
17	Zg1	...(sob)...
18	Xg1	Wh-why are you crying?!
19	Zg1	It's just...I've been so worried for so long...
20	Zg1	Ever since I started raising them for milk...\nI've been wondering what they really think\nabout me...
21	Zg1	So...(sniff)...to see that they've\nlong thought of me as a friend...\nand a close one at that...
22	O	...There, there, Tussie.
23	O	No one knows them as well as you do,\nyou know.
24	O	Of course they know just how much\nyou care for them, don't you worry.
25	Zg1	OK...
26	Zg1	...Right, I'm going to work even harder,\nto make sure these guys grow up big and\nstrong, so they can help protect us all.
27	Zg1	And I'm sure there's plenty more things\nyou can teach me. Right, Nandun?
28	Zg1	Hehe, thank you. I'll be needing you\neven more than ever now, you hear?

1	@f1	Raw food doesn't last for long!
2	@f1	It all has to be eaten on the spot, and\nthat's even if there're whole netloads\nof them to munch your way through!
3	O	You're right... We really have to\nfind some other foodstuffs.
4	4	Have you thought about stockpiling a\nbunch of preserved foods? I could tell you\nsome simple things to make, if you want.
5	@f1	You'd do that for us?!
6	@f1	Sun-drying and preserving with salt...?\nWell, we could probably do those.
7	@f1	Nico - in other words, I - can start\nmaking the salt right away, which then\nleaves the ingredients...
8	4	Hmm. Now that I'm here, I may as well\nhelp with procuring the ingredients.
9	@f1	Yaaay! You're an absolute lifesaver.
10	@f1	Just make sure you bring anything\ntasty-looking back to my place, OK?
11	@f1	All's well and good on the salt-making\nfront! How about the ingredient-procuring\nfront?
12	@f1	You've been such a massive\nhelp. Thank you so much!
13	4	Preserved foods go off easily when there's\nmoisture around. Make sure that moisture\ndoesn't get inside the stores.
14	@f1	Nico hears you, loud and clear!
15	O	We've still got ingredients to cut up and\ndry, don't we? Do you mind me helping\nout a little more?
16	@f1	No need! You've got to look after\nthe others, after all, Fifi.
17	@f1	And besides, if there's anyone can help\nme out with this all this food-smoking stuff,\nit'd be Hildie. I'll go ask her to help.
18	O	OK. I'll let you handle the rest, then!
19	@f1	You can count on Nico! I'll go ahead and\nreport this to Tallooloo! ...You remember\nwho Nico is, right?
20	@f1	You're amazing, Taion. It's incredible how\nyou made that so easy to understand.
21	@f1	Nico - I - was worried the explanation would\ngo right over my head, but you actually made\nit kind of fun, I'm not gonna lie!

evt/nq/msg_nq990601t.json
0	Zg1	I have to wonder whether my\noutdoor Armus are doing OK.
1	Zg1	Occasionally, I'll hear scared wails\ncoming from them... They seem to\nbe very on-edge about something.
2	O	Maybe something happened that put them\non-edge...? It's enough to make you\nwonder, isn't it?
3	Zg1	I know, right? I suppose the best thing to\ndo now is go check up on them...
4	3	You can just leave that to us. You've got\nthings you need to do here, right?
5	Zg1	Y-you're right. Thank you.
6	Zg1	Then I'll leave the Armus to you.\nI'll send the location to your Irises.
7	Zg1	I really hope I'm just overthinking things...
8	Zg1	Let me know right away once you find out\nwhat's happening to my Armus.
9	Zg1	So, it was some monsters that were putting\nmy Armus on edge...?
10	O	Yeah. They were attacking in hordes in\norder to expand their feeding grounds.
11	Zg1	So that's what it was? Well, I hope this\nmeans my darlings can relax now...
12	Zg1	Thank you for saving them from those\nhorrible monsters. I'll go ahead and\nreport this to Tallow.
13	Zg1	I wasn't able to collect too many point\nstickers, since I was so slow to respond...

0	bg1	Oh, just who I wanted to see!
1	bg1	So, like, I found this thing that was just\nlying around on the beach. Any idea what\nit is?
2	5	I mean, it's a doll, ain't it? Kinda\nlooks like the ones Joran used to make.
3	bg1	A "doll"?
4	5	Uh, they're like...things that you\nmake to look like things that you\nlike...? If you like that kinda thing.
5	bg1	Really now...? Then that means this was\nprobably something really special to\nsomeone...
6	bg1	...Which also means it'll stand out to its\nowner if this doll goes back to them\nmissing a shoe.
7	5	You picked it up on the beach, right?\nThat missing shoe musta washed\nup somewhere along there, I'd bet.
8	O	Shall we go look for it, then?
9	bg1	You'd do that for me?! Thank you!
10	bg1	Well, then, I'll clean this little fella up\nwhile I wait for you guys.
11	bg1	Even dolls would prefer having\na full pair of shoes on them, I bet.
12	bg1	I'd be so happy if you could find\nthe right shoe for this guy!
13	bg1	You found it?! Yeeeah!\nThank you so, so much!
14	bg1	Now this little guy looks just like he\nshould. I was hoping we could return\nit to its owner...
15	bg1	...Except, I realized I don't even know if its\nowner is still alive... Guess I'll just have to\ntake care of the doll in their place, then.

5	Xg1	Yeah! I got it from Kana. She said it was a\ncharm that calms down your emotions.
6	Xg1	Which is great for me, because I get\ntunnel vision any time I get in a panic...

3	zf1	I can't cook like Lotus,\nI'm not even clever like\nTallow is...
4	zf1	I know what a tough time everyone else\nis having... But when they're in trouble,\nI can never be of any use to them.

9	O	If anything, I'm a hindrance.
10	O	I'm not strong, I'm not clever, I'm not even\nthat tall...
11	zf1	Please! How are you a hindrance?!
12	zf1	Seeing you always doing everything you\ncan pushes me to do the same, you know?
13	O	I could say the same thing of you.
14	O	Seeing you want to help everyone out\ngives me the power to do the same, Hildie.
15	zf1	That's nice of you to say, Fifi...
16	O	I'd like to collect some Point Stickers\nwith you. I hope that isn't too much\nbother?
17	zf1	...No, it isn't.
18		No, it's what makes *her* great.
19	O	I know... All you see of everyone is what\nyou think is great about them, Hildie.
20	zf1	Well, that's because they are great.
21	O	I don't know about that. *You* may\nthink Tallow is smart, but he sure\ndoesn't think that way about himself.
22	O	What you may think you're bad\nat, everyone else will think you're\ngreat at.
23	O	And frankly, isn't that just great?
24	zf1	I...I guess so.
25	O	See? So, please. I just want you to\nhave more confidence in yourself.
26	O	I mean... I wouldn't know what\nI'd do without you around, Hildie.
27	zf1	Oh, Fifi...
28	zf1	OK, then. I guess I'll get busy\nwith the sticker hunting!
29	zf1	Thank you, Fifi.
30	O	Let's go enjoy ourselves, OK? Together!
31	zf1	Yeah!
32	zf1	Then I'll go tell Tallow.
33	zf1	I'll let him know about the two important\nthings that Fifi taught me.
34	O	What are those?
35	zf1	You taught me that I didn't really know\nmyself, and that I really like you, Fifi.

19	O	I do not!
20	Wg1	Oh yes you do! Though you're not\nas big a Tirkinhead as Tallow is.
21	Wg1	Anyway, you're right... It's important to\nlaugh, and often.

1	1	If you're asking that, then you must be-
2	fe1	I admire your resolution to fight us all on\nyour own, though to be honest, I'd thought\na sergeant would know far, far better.
3	df1	W-wait a minute! I don't intend to fight!
4	fe1	Please. You deliberately called us over. Do\nyou think we're stupid enough to believe\nyou're not fighting us after doing that?
5	df1	...We can't fight on any more, I'm telling\nyou. We're all so exhausted, we can\nbarely move.
6	df1	I knew we should never have done this...\nTaking over a Castle with no supplies was\nasking for trouble right from the start.
7	4	So, you're saying you surrender?
8	df1	Yeah... But before that, could you give me\nand my soldiers some food to eat?
9	df1	I know just how pathetic I look begging\nyou like this, but I'd be nothing without\nmy soldiers.
10	5	If you knew how bad of an idea this was\nahead of time, you shouldn't have tried\ntaking over the Castle in the first place.
11	df1	...
12	1	But first, the food. We haven't got enough\nto let you eat it all, so someone will\nneed to get some more.
13	le1	Sounds like a job for me! I happen to\nknow someone who can give me exactly\nwhat I need to help these guys out.
14	3	...You sure you ain't going to poison\nthem with something dodgy?
15	le1	I am a chef, remember?\nJust you wait and see!
16	le1	I'll need to head back to the fort canteen\nfirst. With their kitchen, I can cook up just\nwhat these guys need.

0	te1	Hello, Denny-boy. Been ages and ages\nand ages since Panina see you.
1	le1	It certainly has been ages, ma'am.\nSorry to rush through the conversation,\nbut can I borrow your kitchen?
2	te1	Please to go nuts, Denny-boy. You good\nfriend, and Panina always help out friend\nin need, whatever need may be.
3	le1	Happy to hear it. I'll help myself to a\nfew of your ingredients as well, then.\nI'll pay you back later.
4	te1	Condiment that Denny-boy always\nlike to use is found on usual shelf.\nGo do what need doing now.
5	le1	All righty, then. Let's get cracking!
6	le1	Sorry for the wait. The food's\nall done and ready to eat now.
7	le1	Let's head back to the Castle before it\ngets cold.
evt/nq/msg_nq991503f.json
0	le1	Here's your order. I call it:\n"Fortifying Gold Soup"!
1	df1	M-my word...! It's just an ordinary looking\nsoup, and yet just by the smell alone,\nI already feel so reinvigorated!
2	le1	It's a special soup which blends spices and\nnatural medicines together, making for a\ndelicious and invigorating meal.
3	le1	The stomach can't digest solids after a\nlong period of starvation, so you'll need to\neat this first, before you eat anything solid.
4	df1	...I'm shocked that you'd go this far for us!
5	df1	...Now that we've surrendered,\nwhat do we do?
6	df1	If the Queen, the war with Agnus,\neverything we knew was fake, then what\ndo we believe in and fight for now?
7	le1	Well... I'm no boffin, so I can't really help\nyou out with that one.
8	le1	But, if there's one thing I think I can say,\nit's this:
9	le1	You should first get a tasty meal in your\nsystem to cheer yourself up before doing\nanything.
10	le1	That way, you'll fill your belly, your mood\nwill improve, and then the good ideas will\nstart coming to mind, I'm sure.
11	df1	...Haha, you're really aren't a boffin. But,\nit's not what you say, but how you say it\nthat counts.
12	df1	Looking back, me and my soldiers\ncould've done with dwelling a little\nless on things past, I think.
13	df1	Once my soldiers have finished eating your\nsoup, we'll be heading back to the Captain\nof the Guard.
14	df1	Of course, it won't be to beg for her\nforgiveness, but to seriously consider\nwhat our future will look like.
15	le1	Nice one. I bet the Captain of the Guard\nwill be thinking about the same thing too.
16	df1	Also...once we get the chance again, we'd\nabsolutely love to have some more of your\ntasty cooking.
17	le1	You better believe I'll cook you up a\nstorm! There won't be any wanting bellies\nby the time you're all done eating!
18	me1	Oh, what the spark! That's not fair! Why\ndoes Brand always deescalate everything?!
19	fe1	There's more ways to fight than besting an\nopponent in battle. And Branden *won*,\ndid he not?
20	5	I gotta say, I'm glad things *didn't*\nescalate for once...

0	ff1	Ah! Are you the reinforcements?!
1	1	Yes. The Captain of the Guard requested\nthat we come. We'll be taking over now.
2	ff1	I-I see. I hope you'll understand\nif we withdraw for now.
3	ff1	The guy you're about to meet... Well,\nhe doesn't go easy on us just because\nwe're Kevesi... You be careful too.
4	ef1	Well, well, well. If I ain't gone\ncompletely loony, I think I see a\nvery warm an' familiar face.
5	fe1	I figured you'd be involved somehow,\nBalroy.
6	3	Hey, do those two know each other or\nsomething?
7	le1	Oh, they can't seem to get rid of each\nother. Though I'll be honest, it's more\nof a one-sided thing.
8	ef1	But I've gotta say, you're really\nnot the luckiest snuffer, are ya?
9	ef1	You must've been begged to come here by\nthat pathetic coward of a guard captain;\ntears pouring down her eyes an' all.
10	ef1	But 'nuff of all that. Why dontcha join\nmy squad? I'd love nothin' more than\nto kill some snuffers with ya again!
11	fe1	You seem to be salivating at the\nthought of it.
12	ef1	Gahaha! Well, 'course I am! Kill or be\nkilled! That's what it's all 'bout for us\nsoldiers!
13	ef1	The Queen bein' a fake?\nPeace with Agnus?
14	ef1	Don't care 'bout any of that!
15	ef1	You could be Kevesi, Agnian, whoever!\nDon't matter to me! All that matters to\nme is killin'!
16	ef1	Ya get it, dontcha, Zor? Why you ain't\nin the Guard no more, eh? Dontcha?
17	fe1	...You appall me.
18	ef1	I'm sorry? What d'ya say there?\nCouldn't hear ya too well, old chum.
19	fe1	I have nothing more to say to a\nblustering piece of scum like you.
20	ef1	...Blustering, you say? And what's that\ns'posed to mean?
21	fe1	I said, I have nothing more to say to you,\nscum. Let's get on with it, already.
22	ef1	...Oooh! Just what I wanted to hear!\nWell, let's get down to business, then!
23	ef1	Once I have your head, I'll do ya the\nhonor of returning it to your precious\nCaptain of the Guard!

1	fe1	And you're nothing but instinct,\nBalroy. It takes a whole lot more\nthan that to beat me.
2	ef1	Oh, come off it! We're one an'\nthe same, we both know that\nmuch!
3	fe1	You're but a slave to the thrill of the fight.\nYou can't even begin to comprehend why\nit is that people actually fight.
4	fe1	We fight to better ourselves into something\nmore till we can give no more...\nNo matter how futile we think it may be.
5	ef1	...Aren't ya gonna finish me off?
6	fe1	That's for her to decide, not me. Though\nit's not like I'd give an honorable death to\na fool like you, anyhow.
7	fe1	We're done here.\nLet's move.

1	wj1	What's it to you? Will I get to fight you\nlot, if I talk?
2	4	That all depends on what you tell us.
3	wj1	Hmph, well, I guess it's worth a punt...\nI got locked up for the crime of mass\nmurder.
4	wj1	A clear violation of military discipline.\nSimple enough reason, right?
5	wj1	Thinking back on it now, I guess\nI just wasn't a soldier the Consul\ncould control.
6	wj1	But that's beside the point. You gonna\nfight me, or not? Out with it.
7	wj1	But that's besides the point. You gonna\nfight me, or not? Out with it.
8	wj1	So, you're feeling up for a fight, are ya?
9	1	Before that, there's something we want to\nmake sure of. Is it true that you murdered\nmultiple Kevesi soldiers?
10	wj1	Did ya miss it the first time round?\n'Course I did.
11	4	You used a Levnis during the incident,\ndidn't you?
12	wj1	Well, now... Someone's done their\nresearch. But yeah, I killed a snuff ton of\nthe enemy in a Levnis.
13	2	And you stayed behind last to fight them\noff, so you could save your fleeing\ncomrades, if I'm not mistaken?
14	wj1	Where the spark did you-\n...Anyway, yeah. That's also right.
15	wj1	Now, about that enemy. I dunno what\ncolony they came from, but they sure didn't\nknow snuff about fighting honorably.
16	wj1	Seeing those dishonorable mudders\nslaughtering my friends made me go\nright off the deep end!
17	wj1	I had to get any of my guys still\nbreathing out of there, but I couldn't\njust let them get away with it!
18	wj1	I was too drained to wield my Blade, so I\ngot into a Levnis, and made 'em regret\neven being alive! That's all there is to it.
19	1	Right, we now understand what happened.
20	wj1	Not like me telling you all this is gonna\nmake a lick of difference, though, is it?
21		Tell Soona about Tohma's story?
22		Tell her
23	1	We're heading off to tell Soona from\ninternal security about your story.\nWe won't be long.
24		Not yet
25	wj1	What? Still got something\nya need from me?
26	wj1	Have you met the other guys\nlocked up in here yet?
27	wj1	If you're gonna be fighting 'em, then make\nsure I'm involved, too! I'd love to see how\nI match up against you guys!
evt/nq/msg_nq995101t.json
0	lk1	Tohma is a man who cared deeply\nfor his allies.
1	lk1	In that battle with Keves, his squad was on\nthe verge of being completely massacred.
2	lk1	But the nutty mudder broke position to\ntake rearguard and charge right at them,\nletting his squad retreat in the process.
evt/nq/msg_nq995102t.json
0	mk1	Tohma was jailed for violating military\ndiscipline during a battle with Keves.
1	mk1	Everything I ever heard about him suggested\nhe was a superb Levnis pilot, albeit one who\nhad a bit of an issue following orders.
2	mk1	Soona's worrying about whether she\nshould free the guy or not, but personally,\nI'm against it.
evt/nq/msg_nq995104s.json
0	1	If we're to believe what Tohma has told\nus, then it would seem he got locked up\nfor the crime of mass murder.
1	6	But we also heard that he took rearguard\nin order to let his comrades retreat.
2	4	And while he was fighting to save his\ncomrades, he killed a large number of\nKevesi soldiers.
3	3	It's not like he did his case any favors,\nbut he was just fighting his enemy, right?\nThat's what we're all taught to do.
4	1	Certainly. That would just be the normal\nthing to do when you're in the Flame\nClock's clutches.
5	4	Excuse my speculation, but he didn't\nextract the flame from the enemies\nhe defeated, did he?
6	4	If he was blinded by rage like he said,\nthen I think he was more preoccupied with\ncrushing those Kevesi than anything else.
7	2	You do raise a good point... You can't\nexactly extract someone's flame while in\na Levnis.
8	4	Looking at it from the Consul's point of\nview, that wasting of good flame would've\nbeen cause enough to lock him up.
9	5	This'll sound grim, but hear me out. I think\nthe Consul could've solved this more easily\nif he'd just snuffed him on the spot.
10	4	Good point, but you have to consider that\nTohma's deeds would've won him favor\nwith the troops, despite irking the Consul.
11	4	Executing him for valiantly saving the lives\nof his fellow soldiers would've backfired\nmassively.
12	3	He was a right pain in the Consul's arse,\nthat's for certain.
13	4	It would go some way to explaining why it\nwould've been far easier for the Consul\nto lock him up under false pretenses.
14	2	So, then, perhaps it'll be possible to not\nonly convince him not to fight us, but also\nto free him from prison.
15	5	I don't mind fighting him, either way. But\nwe'd be saved a whole lot of fuss if you\ncould talk him out of it somehow.
16	2	There's only one way to find out.\nLet's head to Tohma's cell, and\nsee what we can do.
evt/nq/msg_nq995105f.json
0	vj1	There you are. Where have you guys\nbeen? Finally decided to do battle\nwith those wretches?
1	1	Before it gets to that, we'd like to find out\nif you know anything more about what\nTohma did.
2	vj1	You mean the mass murder? Well...as far\nas I remember, he indiscriminately killed a\nload of Kevesi, without extracting their life.
3	vj1	That led the Consul at the time to arrest\nhim, and lock him up in here.
4	4	I'm afraid to tell you that your crafty\nConsul bent the truth about what really\nhappened.
5	vj1	Huh? What do you mean?
6	1	Let us explain...
7	vj1	What the...? So, he was fighting to save his\ncomrades?
8	vj1	But that wasn't in the report...
9	4	It's like we said, the Consul bent the truth\nto make it seem like he was fighting for\nfighting's sake, not for his comrades' lives.
10	vj1	Well, now that I think about, there were\nsome guys in my term who managed to\nsurvive that battle...
11	6	Although Tohma could've definitely tried to\nextract some flame from the enemy...
12	6	...it's not a stretch to say that he had\nhis reasons to do what he did.
13	vj1	That settles it, then. I've got no reason to\ndoubt you guys. You're the ones who freed\nus from the clock, after all.
14	vj1	I've also got no reason to doubt that the\nTohma I knew would've done everything\nfor his comrades and for Agnus.
15	1	Oh... Well, thank you.
16	wj1	Ah! Been a while since I've had proper\nfresh air. Tastes better than I remember!
17	vj1	I can bet. You should be thankful to Noah\nand the others for that.
18	wj1	You bet I'm thankful to them. Not to\nmention to you too, of course!
19	vj1	Just don't you get yourself in any more\ntrouble, OK? I'm busy enough as it is.
20	wj1	I wouldn't do that when it's this nice\noutside! Don't you worry yourself one bit.\nI'm still one capable soldier, believe me!

1	5	Yeah, but staying on topic, what got you\nbranded as a fiend, and locked up in here?
2	xj1	Well, my great crime was blowing up a\ncontainer the salvage corps was going to\nsalvage.
3	xj1	Horrible thing to do, right? Wasting away\nsupplies they worked so hard to get.
4	5	That's a new one to me... Why go and\nblow up valuable supplies?
5	xj1	I mean, who cares about that, really? You\nguys have come here to fight us three\nfiends, right?
6	xj1	I'm ready to fight whenever you are, but\ndon't keep me waiting too long.
7	xj1	You ready to fight? Because I'm ready\nwhenever you are.
8	xj1	You finally ready now? Kept\nme waiting long enough.
9	1	Before we fight, there's something I want\nto confirm with you. Specifically, the\nreason you blew up that container.
10	xj1	...What's it to you? It's not like I can make\nthose supplies magically come back.
11	4	True, but to just blow up a container for\nno reason, you'd have to be out of your\nmind, which you don't seem to be.
12	xj1	Funny you mention that, because I was out\nof my mind when I blew up the container.
13	4	Or, perhaps...you noticed that that\ncontainer had been booby-trapped.
14	xj1	...
15	4	You don't have to be out of your mind to\nsacrifice supplies in the name of protecting\nyour comrades.
16	4	Although I wouldn't call it a flawless plan,\nI can't see why it would be egregious\nenough to violate military discipline.
17	4	If one knew that a container did have\nsomething lethal in it, then blowing it\nup would be perfectly justifiable.
18	5	Lethal? What do you mean, lethal?
19	4	It could've been something explosive, or\npoisonous... You didn't know what was\ninside, but you had a feeling, didn't you?
20	6	It's odd to think airdropped supplies could\nhave something like that in them... Unless,\nthe Consul had something to do with it?
21	4	Indeed. It's not impossible to see why the\nConsul could've thought up something\nfiendish like that.
22	3	And since blowing up seemingly good\nsupplies is a big no-no, that gave the\nConsul the perfect pretext to lock you up.
23	xj1	Hahaha, cool theory. But the last time I\nchecked, theories don't count as hard\nevidence.
24	4	Indeed, all we've got is reasoning that\npaints you in a favorable light.
25	4	The simplest, most straightforward reason\nwould be that you were out of your mind\nat the time.
26	xj1	I'll give you this, though. I had fun\nlistening to your theory. Your reasoning\nskills aren't too bad, either.
27	xj1	So, here's what really happened:\nIt's true that I blew up the container...
28	3	You serious?
29	xj1	And like you said, four-eyes, that\ncontainer was indeed booby-trapped.
30	1	...You knew something was up, well before\nthe incident, didn't you?
31	xj1	Yeah, right after Tohma had been locked up.\nWe're long-term friends, and I was livid about\nhis arrest. I just couldn't let it slide.
32	xj1	As I was looking into it, I began to pick up\nthat the Consul was hiding something in\na container.
33	xj1	So, when he went along with the salvage\ncorps to procure it, I blew it up, hoping to\nuse it against the mudder himself.
34	3	Yikes. OK, I take it all back.\nMaybe she is loopy...
35	xj1	The Consul must've caught on that I was\nsniffing around, and that's why he rigged\nthe container.
36	xj1	Would've been happy dying alongside him to\nprotect my mates, but it didn't go to plan, so\nI ended up here in the slammer instead.
37	xj1	It was there I had a hunch that my...or rather,\n*our* enemy wasn't Keves. Though I guess\nI don't need to call it a hunch any more.
38	xj1	I've long wondered what people like\nyou guys were like - guys who've\nfought with Consuls.
39	3	Oh, no... This is a "I wanna know what\nreal strength looks like!" type of scenario,\nisn't it? For the love of sparks...
40		Tell Soona about Xera's story?
41		Tell her
42	2	We'll go explain your story to Soona from\nsecurity. Just hold on for a bit.
43		Not yet
44	xj1	Huh? You need *more* from me now?
45	xj1	Well. I'm always up for a fight, so just let\nme know when you want one. Just don't\nget too distracted with the other two, OK?
evt/nq/msg_nq995201t.json
0	nk1	I heard the girl that blew up that supply\ncontainer might be getting released from\nprison. I'm hesitant, to be honest.
1	nk1	I know it's said she had Agnus's best\ninterests in mind when she did it, but\nI find that hard to believe.
evt/nq/msg_nq995202t.json
0	6	We'd like to ask you about Xera's story.
1	tj1	Uh...sure? I mean, Xera's already locked\nup now, so I'm not sure what difference\nit'll make...
2	tj1	But eh, why not, I guess? You guys must\nhave your reasons for asking, I suppose.
3	tj1	Xera used to be part of the salvage corps.\nShe achieved much as a soldier, and was\nwell regarded for her nous in battle.
4	tj1	But one day, there was an incident\non a mission to procure an airdrop\nsupply container...
5	tj1	I'm sure you probably know already, but\nfor some reason, she decided to blow up\nthat container.
6	tj1	Everyone was furious about the waste of\nsupplies. It wasn't even like there were\nKevesi trying to steal them or anything.
7	tj1	The Consul at the time therefore claimed\nshe was plotting an insurrection, and\nimprisoned her.
8	tj1	I can't even begin to tell you what she\nwas thinking blowing up those perfectly\ngood supplies.
evt/nq/msg_nq995203t.json
0	_j1	Xera? Yeah, I know her. She was a hot\ntopic for a little while here.
1	_j1	She was in the squad that mainly salvages\nsupplies, and was a snuffing capable\nsoldier herself.
2	_j1	And when supply containers are\nbeing targeted by enemy scavenging\nteams, soldiers like her are invaluable.
3	_j1	The salvage corps and supply team may\nbe known as logistical teams, but that\ndoesn't mean they lack capable fighters.
4	_j1	They're the ones who take the necessary\ndecisive actions, such as blowing up a\ncontainer if the enemy's about to steal it.
5	_j1	Even I always have to stay on my toes.\nYou never know when something might\nhappen.
6	_j1	There's much danger in supply container\nretrieval. If an enemy's about to steal a\ncontainer, it's safer to just blow it up.
evt/nq/msg_nq995204s.json
0	5	So from everything we've heard about\nXera, you'd almost think she grew up\nferal or something.
1	4	...It's hard to consider blowing up supplies\nas anything but a military discipline\nviolation, that much is certain.
2	2	True... But something really doesn't add\nup here.
3	3	Yeah. Like, if I were planning an\ninsurrection, I sure wouldn't start it by\nblowing up some random supplies.
4	6	You're right, Eunie.\nWhat'd be the point in that?
5	1	I guess the key here is to find out what\nher reason was for blowing up that\ncontainer.
6	5	I just thought of something. Like, isn't it a\nlittle odd the Consul didn't sentence her to\ndeath right away?
7	4	Good point... Usually, in this situation,\nthe offender would get executed to send\na warning to the rest of the colony.
8	4	Perhaps the Consul saw some sort of\nvalue in keeping Xera alive.
9	1	If we can present a concrete theory as to\nwhy she got locked up and not executed,\nthat could help our case a lot.
10	3	And what do we do when we find out\nafter she's freed that she's just an utter\nmaniac?
11	2	Fight her, I guess...
12	3	Figured that. Guess we should go see her,\nthen.
evt/nq/msg_nq995205f.json
0	vj1	If you're gonna fight anyone, be quick\nabout it. I'd rather not have my life in\ndanger any longer than necessary.
1	2	We just got done talking to Xera for her\nside of the story. We think we might just\nhave a case for freeing her from prison.
2	vj1	Wait, seriously...? We can let her go?
3	2	Considering she faced up to a great enemy\nall by herself, we think you'll see why she\ndeserves to be free.
4	vj1	Great? As in size? You're saying she can\ngo toe-to-toe with a Levnis or something?!
5	3	We don't mean that kinda "great"...
6	vj1	But, like...she loves blowing stuff up, right?\nWhat if she decides to blow up the\nCastle?! It doesn't bear thinking about!
7	5	Look, she had her reasons why she did\nwhat she did. Let us explain...
8	vj1	...That's a whole lot to take in, I won't lie.\nBut, I mean, Seeker trusts you guys.
9	vj1	And in either case, Seeker was the one\nwho left it up to my "discretion".
10	vj1	And according to my "discretion", if you\nguys think she isn't guilty, then she sure\nain't guilty to me.
11	2	Thank you so much.
12	xj1	Man. It's crazy to think that I'm actually\noutta prison now.
13	vj1	Now, seeing as I was kind enough to free\nyou, promise me you won't go around\nblowing stuff up, you got that?
14	xj1	Of course, don't worry about it. I don't just\nblow stuff up for no reason, you know.
15	vj1	...Oh, really now?
16	2	But seriously, don't go doing anything\ntoo outrageous, OK?
17	xj1	I know, I know.\nI owe you guys big time, after all.

evt/nq/msg_nq995300t.json
0	6	What did you do to get yourself in here?
1	yj1	Weeell, a whole buncha things, let's say.
2	yj1	I used to work in the inspection branch.\nOne day, I erased a certain piece of intel,\nbut I don't think I did anythin' wrong.
3	yj1	Now, I haven't had a bad time here thanks\nto Tohma and Xera, but you know what?
4	yj1	I now feel like batterin' you lot, and\nmoseying on outta here, if you'd be\nso inclined?
5	yj1	I now feel like batterin' you lot, and\nmoseying on outta here, if you'd be\nso inclined?
6	yj1	Oh, up for a fight, then?
7	6	Not quite. We have some things we'd like\nto ask first.
8	2	You managed to get your hands on\nKeves intel, and yet you didn't share\nit with Agnus. Why?
9	yj1	Getting straight to the point again, I see.
10	1	Surely squashing intel about\nKeves wouldn't have been in your\nbest interests.
11	yj1	...All right. Sit back, relax, and let Jhodor tell\nyou a story. Not like I've got much else\nbetter to do, anyway.
12	yj1	After I'd investigated the Keves intel that\nfell into my hands...
13	yj1	I discovered that it was fake intel created\nby our Consul.
14	4	What?
15	yj1	Seems like they weren't too happy about\nus getting more and more powerful,\nand were trying to crush us.
16	yj1	I dunno what was going through their\nhead. It don't even begin to make sense.
17	yj1	Maybe they just thought that screwing\nus was an easy way to fill the Kevesi's\nFlame Clock.
18	yj1	We're the ones who made the Consul so\npowerful, and that's how they decide to\ntreat us?! Boils my blood, it does!
19	yj1	That's why I destroyed that intel, so my\nfriends could withdraw from that pointless\nbattle, and limit the casualties.
20	1	Did you talk about this to anyone?
21	yj1	Absolutely no way I'd've talked to my\nfriends about it. Otherwise, the Consul\nwould've done 'em in.
22	yj1	Thankfully, that mudder can't hurt us\nany more. Talking 'bout it now has lifted a\nweight off my shoulders, it has.
23	yj1	And I've got zero regrets, as well. Got to\nmeet Tohma and Xera here, after all, and\nthey're class!
24	6	At least now, you don't have to bear the\nburden on your own any more.
25	5	She's right. You're not living under that\nConsul's eye any more, so cheer up, mate.
26	yj1	Heh... If I ever do get outta here, I guess\nit might be worth talkin' 'bout what's on\nmy mind a bit more often.
27		Tell Soona about Jhodor's story?
28		Tell her
29	2	We'll go explain your story to Soona from\nsecurity. We won't be long.
30		Not yet
31	yj1	Wait, d'ya need still to ask me questions?
32	yj1	I'm happy to be out an' all, but if you're\nplanning on fighting Tohma and Xera, I'll\nalso be part of their team, you hear?
evt/nq/msg_nq995301t.json
0	ok1	So, I heard Jhodor might be getting out\nsoon.
1	ok1	The very man who brought disorder to his\ncolony by destroying enemy intel. I know I\nwouldn't be letting him out any time soon.
evt/nq/msg_nq995302t.json
0	sj1	I hear that Jhodor is the reason we lost\nthe chance to take out a base in the war\nwith Keves.
1	sj1	I don't know why he did it. I tried asking\nhim, and he flat-out refused to give a\nreason why.
evt/nq/msg_nq995303t.json
0	uj1	Jhodor, you say? Well, he used to be in\nintel. He was my subordinate.
1	uj1	One day, the guy destroyed some intel\nshowing that Keves was making camp\nsomewhere.
2	uj1	If our forces had seen that intel, they\ncould've ambushed that camp, and won\na crucial victory.
3	uj1	But without that intel, we had no chance...\nThere were few casualties, but I'm still at\na loss as to why he didn't share the intel.
4	uj1	It was Jhodor's destruction of that\nKeves intel that cost us victory\nthat day.
evt/nq/msg_nq995304s.json
0	3	So, the story goes that Jhodor destroyed\nKeves intel, and therefore caused damage\nto Agnus's position.
1	1	The mystery here is why did he destroy\nintel that had crucial info on an enemy\ncamp's whereabouts?
2	4	What he did went far beyond a violation of\nmilitary discipline. He could've easily been\nsentenced to death for it.
3	5	Tell me about it. Soldiers're always getting\nkilled by enemies they don't see coming.\nThat kinda intel is worth its weight in gold.
4	4	Which brings up an important question:\nwhy is Jhodor still alive?
5	2	Hmm... I think we might need to ask the\nguy himself about what the true nature of\nthat intel was.
6	6	That'd be quicker, for sure.
7	1	Yeah. Let's go and ask him.
evt/nq/msg_nq995305f.json
0	vj1	What's up? Do you need something?
1	1	We've heard Jhodor's full story.
2	uj1	"Full story"? What's this about?
3	vj1	Don't mind Grover, he's here on\nother business. He fades into the\nbackground pretty easily.
4	uj1	Hey! I just have a soothing presence!
5	1	Anyway, here's what happened...
6	uj1	This is really hard to credit...\nHe was going up against the\nConsul...
7	vj1	What does this all mean? That he didn't\ndo anything wrong, after all?
8	4	What he did was undoubtedly a violation\nof military discipline.
9	vj1	So, then...
10	uj1	If what they're telling us is true, then\nJhodor knowingly went against military\ndiscipline, in order to save Agnian lives.
11	uj1	And then went into jail without ever\ntelling us why he really did what he\ndid...
12	vj1	Well, then, we've got no reason to\nkeep him locked up in here, right?
13	uj1	...
14	uj1	He's a capable guy, I'll give you that. Or,\nshould I say him being too capable was\nwhat got him into that mess?
15	vj1	I'm just as averse to trouble as the\nnext person, but what do you think?
16	uj1	...OK. I think we can let Jhodor go.\nI'll take responsibility for anything\nthat happens.
17	vj1	Well, that'll certainly make my life easier,\nI know that much.
18	uj1	But, if he tries anything funny, I'll throw\nhim back in prison, then throw away the\nkey.
19	6	I'm sure it won't have to come to that.
20	yj1	Whoa. Didn't think you'd be here, too.
21	uj1	Hmph...
22	yj1	Oh, don't get your knickers in a twist.\nI won't do nothin' bad, I promise.
23	yj1	Especially not after you guys got me outta\nthe slammer.
24	5	All we did was listen to your story.\nNothing special about that.

9	3	So if I pop a request on my card,\nsomeone else might see it and send me\none if they find it. That's the rough idea.

14	1	Yeah, it's a good system.\nWhoever made it had the right idea.
15	T	I bet you've been checking up on your\nColony 9 buddies every now and again\nthrough your Iris, eh?
16	1	Absolutely.
17	T	Well, you just be sure to check up on me\nas well, all right? Make it a daily ritual.
18	1	Hahah, way ahead of you, Mwamba.
19	8	Would recommend to make tracks\nfor assembly point about right now.
20	5	Shoot, you're right.
21	3	We're assembling by the\nColony 9 Front Gate, right?
22	T	Let's go as soon as you're\nready to decamp.
evt/sq/msg_sq000108t.json
0	hX1	It'd go quicker if I went gathering too,\nbut I've just got so much to take care of...\nYour help is greatly appreciated.
1	hX1	When you've collected all the stuff,\njust lob it onto the Collectopaedia Card.\nI'll be able to confirm it straight away.
evt/sq/msg_sq000202f.json
0	2	Crustips.
1	1	One, two, three...\nYeah, quite a number, too.
2	5	Reckon they've staked the\nFerronis as their turf?
3	1	We'll have to get rid of them before\nwe can search for salvageable materials.
4	2	Sounds like a plan.
evt/sq/msg_sq000203f.json
0	1	How does it look, Riku?
1	8	Meh-meh... Power level is at precisely\nzero, so Riku cannot say one way or other.
2	3	Guess without a Flame Clock,\nit really was kind of a long shot...
3	5	Bet we could force open the containers.\nThey don't look so tough.
4	4	If you're confident you can do that without\nbreaking the contents, be my guest.
5	5	No promises.
6	8	Stop! No need for gratuitous violence.\nCan solve problem with ether cylinder.
7	8	Riku surely have one somewhere...
8	8	Uh... Meh.
9	3	Do my eyes deceive me,\nor is that flat-out empty?
10	5	Back at the colony, we'd always complain\nabout how we were short on this or that...
11	5	But even a fraction of the supplies there\nwould be more than we have now...
12	1	Now that we're away, I'm sure\nwe'll miss home ever more keenly.
13	2	Hey, correct me if I'm wrong, but...\nwe just need to supply it with ether to\nget it running, right?
14	2	I ask, because... Look over there...
15	2	Isn't that an ether channel?
16	2	It doesn't look too far. I'll go take a look,\nsee if I can harvest some for us.
17	6	I'll go with you!
18	1	There's safety in numbers.\nMaybe it would be better if we all\ntry to stick together.
19	4	I second that assessment.
20	2	OK, then. Let's go right now.
evt/sq/msg_sq000204f.json
0	8	Should be enough.
1	4	Moving forward, there will doubtless be\ntimes when ether will prove indispensable.\nLet's gather it when we have a chance.
2	1	Let's get back to the Ferronis and use\nthe ether cylinder to try and reboot the\nmotor assembly.
3	2	Right!
evt/sq/msg_sq000205f.json
0	1	It moved!
1	2	Now we should be able to claim\nthe contents of those containers.
2	4	We may be able to claim more\nthan we first anticipated.
3	3	How d'you reckon?
4	4	That's how.
5	4	By restoring power to the Ferronis,\nit would seem we've brought the\nmicrofab back to life as well.
6	4	So yes, I'd recommend checking\nthe fabricator while we're on our\nlittle salvaging stint.
evt/sq/msg_sq000206f.json
0	1	We found plenty of useful stuff here.
1	2	There was more left behind\nthan I'd dared hope.
2	5	I couldn't detect any monster presence\naround the Ferronis perimeter.
3	1	Seems like we'll be safe, then.\nShall we rest here for the day?
4	6	Ooh, I've still got energy left in the tank.\nI can take first watch!
5	4	Sena, acting alone really isn't-
6	zY1	Meh?!
7	6	Whoa?!
8	5	What the-?!
9	zY1	Meheheheheh...\nShillshill is not Nopon of dubious origin...
10	4	Your colony affiliation and objective.\nTell me quick.
11	zY1	Shillshill is traveling traderpon,\nnot bound to any 'pon or man.
12	zY1	Saw light shining here, so took it upon self\nto investigate so-called haps.
13	3	A Nopon vagrant, then...? Man.\nIs there anywhere you guys aren't?
14	zY1	Why have to call "vagrant"?\nThat word show real lack of respect!
15	1	You're not with Agnus or Keves, right?\nHow about..."itinerant", then?
16	zY1	Meh! Suppose that slightly better.\nAnyhow, any friend that Shillshill meet\nsoon turn to customer, and vice versa!
17	1	So what kinds of things do you sell?
18	zY1	Oh, Search Headgear, and Bunnit Choker,\nand all that jazz. Shillshill deal in anything!
19	zY1	That Shillshill meet friends here is\nalso fate. Shillshill give good price,\nso please to buy lots!
20	2	I'm a little worried about our finances...
21	1	You're right, especially since we won't be\npaid bounties from our colonies any more...
22	zY1	In that case, please to sell any and all\nthings of monetary value to Shillshill!
evt/sq/msg_sq000207t.json

evt/sq/msg_sq000208f.json
0	zY1	Pleasure doing business!
1	5	You're not gonna buy our\nTasty Sausages?
2	zY1	Shillshill only buy goods which can sell on\nat high price! Is basic business sense.
3	3	Wow, suddenly I feel like we\ngot ripped off...
4	1	It's all right, I think both\nparties benefited here.
5	2	I think we might want to make a habit of\ntrading with Nopon like this to earn money.
6	zY1	Meheh! Friends feel like becoming\nregular customers?
7	zY1	Heart of Shillshill soar! Will be\nmore than happy to buy from friends,\nwhenever and wherever!
8	1	What do you mean, "wherever"...?
9	zY1	When friends find items, Shillshill can\nconfirm using terminal and wire money\nright back.
10	zY1	Shillshill think friends\nnot complain, yes-yes?
11	2	It sounds good to me.
12	4	Hmm... Dealing with independent Nopon\nhas the benefit of being untraceable by\nour former colonies.
13	5	It sure makes transactions easy.
14	zY1	Then it decided! From today on,\nShillshill count friends among own patrons!
15	zY1	Shillshill will abide here for some time.\nIf friends need anything, please to holler.
16	6	We will! Thanks!
17	1	That's one difficulty taken care of.
18	2	Yeah.
19	1	All right. Time we finally got some rest.
evt/sq/msg_sq000209f.json
0	1	...It won't budge.
1	8	It because Ferronis is low on power.\nIf we bring it online, containers might open.
2	8	In Ferronis of this type,\npower compartment usually\nlocated over there.
3	1	OK. Let's take a look, then.
evt/sq/msg_sq000210f.json
0	4	It's a microfab, a hand-operable fabricator\ncommonly installed in older Ferronises.
1	4	For a price, we can make the things\nthis Ferronis used to produce.
2	3	Nifty little gadget, eh?
3	3	Let's take this thing for a spin, then!
evt/sq/msg_sq000302f.json
0	5	Phew, I'm stuffed!\nBeen a while since I pigged out like that.
1	6	Thanks for the feast!\nYou really outdid yourself, Manana.
2	1	I'm floored that you can create such\nstellar meals here in the wilderness.
3	9	Manana blush.
4	2	She even went out on the\nbattlefield with us, cooking\nfor the soldiers.
5	1	She carried *that*...into battle...?
6	2	I think she wanted to do all she could for\nthe troops' morale, especially on the front,\nwhere it's so easy to feel doubt or anxiety.
7	3	Whoa, imagine that...
8	9	But Manana also enjoy travel with Mio\nand friends! Could not have discovered\nsuch amazeful ingredients otherwise!
9	9	With new dishes and ingredients,\nrepertoire of Manana go through roof!
10	9	By the by, what do Riku do\non team of Noah and friends?
11	8	Riku provide support across board.\nIn other words, do everything.
12	8	Biggest talent lie in maintain of\npower frame, also gemcraft.
13	2	You're pretty spectacular in\nyour own right!
14	4	Now that we can no longer rely on our\ncolonies for supplies and improvements,\nhe should indeed be an indispensable asset.
15	8	Friends want to see master trick of Riku?
16	6	Yeah, totally! Show us!
17	8	At this very moment...
18	8	Riku cannot.
19	6	Whaaa-?!
20	3	Mate, you can't just pull the rug out\nfrom under our feet like that!
21	8	Riku just not able to do\non sudden command.
22	8	To make gems, require gathering\nof suitable materials first.
23	1	Hey, Riku...
24	8	Yes?
25	1	Up until now, we've just relied on you\nfor all our repairs and maintenance...
26	1	But thinking about the road ahead,\nI wonder if it wouldn't be better if we\nlearned to tweak our Blades ourselves...
27	5	Yeah, that!
28	8	Mehrrm...\nIs not thing that can learn\njust by snapping fingers!
29	2	If it's possible though, I'd like to learn too.
30	6	And me, as well...!
31	8	Meh, fine, Riku cave.
32	8	Will show way of gem crafting to friends,\nas special exception!
33	8	First have to collect materials, like said.
34	8	Riku noticed Aspar during earlier jaunt\nthrough Ricoth Wellspring. Will need\nGlaring Eyeball from that.
evt/sq/msg_sq000303f.json
0	8	OK, since friends creaking with anticipation,\nRiku teach art of gem crafting.
1	8	In point of fact, for craft gems,\nin addition to materials that gather\nearliers, also need gemstone for base.
2	5	Huh, there's more to it than I thought...
3	8	But no cause for concernment.\nThis time Riku have own reserve,\nso we use that.
4	1	Sharp thinking, Riku. Thanks.
5	8	Now, Riku set up apparatus.
6	8	First step, set gemstone here.
7	8	That work as base substrate,\ninto which materials introduced,\nand then processed.
8	8	When do so, can express\nvarious useful effects.
9	8	Finally, equip, and enjoy.
10	6	Right, riiiiiight...
11	8	If friends grasp principle,\nall that left is to put in practice.
evt/sq/msg_sq000304f.json
0	8	And that conclude process.
1	5	Wow, that took yonks...
2	8	Should not expect to go as fast\nor smooth as when do in colony,\nwith proper equipment.
3	1	Still, I think we got the gist.\nIt might go quicker the second\ntime around.
4	8	Noah, please to apply product now.
5	1	I'm on it.
evt/sq/msg_sq000305f.json
0	1	There we go.
1	5	Let's see just how strong it's gotten, yeah?
2	3	It's already nighttime.\nCan't it wait till morning?
3	1	...Oh. You're right.
4	8	With right materials, can create gems\nwith all kinds of properties.
5	8	Master art of gem crafting, and even\nGonzalez become easy-peasy like\ntiny little Bunnit.
6	8	When find new materials,\nRiku craft new gems together!
7	9	Manana also can make all sorts of dishes\nif have big choice of ingredients!
8	9	And also arrange dishes in courses,\nand menus, and accord to color, and...
9	3	All right, put a sock in it!\nWe get it!
10	1	Well. I think that's probably enough\nfor today. Let's bunk down.
11	5	Guess I'll take first watch.
12	4	We might be able to conserve more energy\nif we leave before sunrise.
13	2	Yeah, thanks... Good night.
evt/sq/msg_sq000311f.json
0	1	That's the one we have to take down?
1	6	It...looks a little tough...
2	5	Hey, ain't nothing like\na post-meal workout!
3	5	Got your number, mate!
evt/sq/msg_sq000312f.json
0	5	Oof, this thing's handing our arses to us...
1	3	If we don't get a grip, we'll end up\nits pre-meal workout, instead...
2	8	What friends doing?!
3	8	There six of you! What is point of numbers\nif all fight separate and not together?!
4	1	Fight...together...?
5	5	All right then! I guard, then everyone else\npile in while it's distracted!
6	3	What, and run right into the sparker's\njaws? Yeah, no. It's way better taking\nturns sniping at it from a distance!
7	4	Neither of those plans is effective\nagainst an Aspar. If you ask me-
8	6	M-Mimi, do something...
9	2	We'll never be able to fight together\nif everyone's got their own idea...
10	1	Yeah, we have to pick a plan\nand stick with it.
evt/sq/msg_sq000313f.json
0	6	Whoa! That went way better than before!\nThat's teamwork for you, huh!
1	8	Riku rate it three out of five stars.
2	8	Also have the feeling Noah and friends\nstill...for lack of better word, lacking.
3	8	With practice, Riku think friends\ncan pull off bigger and stronger\nspecial teamwork moves.
4	5	Patronizing much, fluffball?
5	2	He's probably right, though.\nIt's only been days since we've\nstarted traveling together.
6	2	We should learn each other's fighting\nstyles little by little, and we're bound\nto see results.
7	1	I fully agree.
8	3	Uh, either way, we got Riku's\nwhatchamacallit.
9	3	Let's head for the oasis?
10	8	Ohohoho! Time is nigh for Riku to\nimpart teachings of gem crafting art!
evt/sq/msg_sq000400t.json
0	yZ1	Ah, you must be the ones\nEthel told us about.
1	1	Yeah. That's us.
2	yZ1	I'd love to give you a proper welcome,\nbut unfortunately, my hands are somewhat\ntied right now. Truly sorry!
3	yZ1	We've a lack of personnel, dwindling\nmedical supplies, and the patients\nwon't stop arriving...
4	yZ1	Things really have been rough ever since\nwe dropped to Dirt rank.
5	1	Not enough medical supplies, huh...?
6	4	So it would appear. That kind of problem\ncalls for a swift handling...
7	1	Oleshandra? Thank you for the heads-up.
evt/sq/msg_sq000401f.json
0	1	All right, let's recap.
1	4	Injuries from local monsters, trouble\nowing to the Colony's location...
2	4	There were also some more urgent cases,\nwith more wounded appearing by the day.
3	6	Yeah, the medic team seemed super busy...
4	2	It sounded like they couldn't provide\nadequate care, so they had always more\npatients coming in.
5	5	I got the feeling they could deal with the\nstaffing problem if they didn't also have\na "not enough stuff" problem...
6	6	You mean, if they had, like,\ndrugs and bandages?
7	4	Those kinds of medical supplies are\ndifficult to craft without specialized\nfacilities.
8	3	Well, we're in the arse end of nowhere,\nand therefore bang out of luck.
9	4	Precisely. It's only a matter of time before\nall the supplies start running out.
10	5	Spark it all. So what, we're up\na creek with no paddle...?
11	2	But we have to do something...!
12	1	Hmm...
13	4	...Ah! Hang on...\nNo, that wouldn't... Or would it...?
14	3	Taion, if you've got something to say,\nthen do, or by the Queen's knuckles,\nI'll slap you.
15	4	Yes, but... Hmm, then again...
16	1	What is it, Taion?
17	2	Did you come up with something?
18	4	...First of all, I have to say\nthere's no guarantee.
19	5	Spit it out, man.\nWe can work out the kinks later.
20	4	...I hear you.\nThen let's leave, this instant.
21	3	You wot? Oi!\nWhere are we off to now?!
22	4	Galghour's Menhir.\nIf we're lucky, we might make it in time.
23	3	In time for what?\nYou're not making sense!
24	4	I said we have to go this instant.\nI'll explain when we get there.
25	1	Eunie, drop it.\nLet's just do as he says.
evt/sq/msg_sq000500f.json
0	6	Nice work, you guys!
1	3	You're done now, right?\nI think we're all fairly whacked.\nShould we turn in for the day?
2	1	You're probably right.
3	2	Sena?
4	6	Oh, hey! What's up, Mimi?
5	2	Are you worried about Lambda?
6	6	Yeah. With their Flame Clock gone,\nit's gonna be really weird for them...\nIt's a big change.
7	6	But when you guys played your song,\nI think that helped calm them down.
8	6	It was kinda awesome, and I thought,\nwell... I wish I could do something like\nthat, too...
9	3	Makes sense you'd feel that way,\nlooking at their miserable mugs.
10	9	Ohoho! In that case, best solution is\nto feed everyone yummy foods!
11	9	Manana will cook up feast to\nlive forever in memory!
12	6	So, like a cook-out?
13	6	I'd love to lend a hand!
14	4	I don't mind clearing it with Commander\nIsurd, but I don't think we have enough\nsupplies on hand to serve everyone.
15	4	...But I do believe this area has a\nplentiful supply of Dainty Shrooms.
16	9	Oho! If Dainty Shrooms on the table,\nthen Manana help look too!
17	1	It won't take too long if we all search.
18	2	Once we've got the ingredients ready, we\nshould set up a stall to share out the food.
19	4	There's a perfect spot for it\nin front of Colony Lambda.\nLet's use it.
20	1	Lanz, we're going.
21	5	...Yeah, OK.
evt/sq/msg_sq000600f.json
0	1	Since we're already out here gathering\nfood, we could think about building up\na reserve of stuff that'll keep for a while.
1	2	That's a good idea. What would that be...?\nMushrooms, nuts, that sort of thing?
2	6	I'm on it!
3	5	By the way, when the Tirkins got into\nour camp, did no one seriously notice?
4	3	Nope! Not even slightly.\nNot even a tiny little bit.
5	8	Riku was busy sawing logs all last night.
6	2	...I'm sorry, you guys.
7	6	We'd walked a lot yesterday.\nI'm sure you were just super pooped.
8	6	You'd never miss something as obvious\nas Tirkin footsteps on a good day, Mimi!
9	1	I think it's safe to say we were all partially\nguilty of negligence this time.
10	4	Indeed.
11	4	However, we should also reconsider our\nstorage arrangements, for the future.
12	3	Ah well, it's water under the bridge now.\nNo point talking locks after the Ardun's\nalready bolted, am I right?
13	3	Let's just get to the searching already.
14	4	...Very well.
15	1	Hey, is that...?
16	6	An Anlood!
17	5	It's hard to fill up on mushrooms alone...\nI say we hunt us some meat, as well.
18	6	Woo-hoo! I love me some hunter-gathering!
evt/sq/msg_sq000601f.json
0	4	...Hm?
1	4	What's this...?
2	6	We ate those yesterday, didn't we?\nMust be lotsa them in these woods...
3	4	Seems so.
4	4	...Well, that explains it.
5	5	What explains what?
6	4	At first glance, it looks just like a\nKelp Mushroom, but in fact...
7	4	...it's what's called a Naiti-Nait,\ncausing overpowering drowsiness\nwhen ingested.
8	6	Huh?!
9	5	Uh, so you're saying...
10	4	We ate these, and that's why we all slept\nclean through the Tirkins stealing our food.
11	4	That's my working hypothesis, anyway.
12	4	I'll go and warn Mio and the others.
13	9	Meh mehhh...
14	9	Was Manana who put in dish...\nShould have known better...
15	6	We all picked the ingredients together,\nso it's not like it's you that was at fa-
16	9	But then Manana blow up on Lanz\nand say many lots of mean things!
17	9	Very deeply sorries...
18	5	Hey, it's all in the past.
19	5	More importantly, all this trudging around\nforaging has given me a wicked appetite.
20	5	We've got enough now, surely?\nLet's go back to camp and make it\ninto something edible.
21	6	Yeah.
22	9	Manana agree also!
evt/sq/msg_sq000701f.json
0	1	Excuse me, are you Samon...?
1	gl1	Most indeed!\nAnd are friends famed Ouroboros?
2	gl1	I hear everything from Monica.\nWill lend spare ship to friends, no worry.
3	1	Thank you very much for this.
4	gl1	She good ship. "Boundary" the name.\nFriends feel free to use.
5	5	Whoa, nice piece of kit, this!
6	3	I've never seen a real ship before,\nexcept in the textbooks...
7	gl1	If friends feeling gratitude, can show\nrespect by add Mr. to start of name.
8	4	...Mr. Samon.
9	4	Uh, sorry to cut the pleasantries short,\nbut could you tell us more about the\ninfiltration plan?
10	gl1	At least ask about boat first, meh...
11	gl1	Bah... Fine.\nSamon explain, so listen up.
12	gl1	Surroundings of Agnus Castle\nunder exceptionally strict guard.\nNothing to unexpect.
13	gl1	Even with most state-of-art cloaking device,\napproach by Levnis greeted with shooting\nand shouting and short sharp landing.
14	gl1	That why, we plan approach on route\nthat go around Erythia Sea.
15	4	From the sea, huh...
16	3	Wait, if they discover us in the drink,\nthen aren't we really royally snuffed?
17	gl1	Erythia Sea shrouded in black fog.
18	gl1	If use ship to glide along on surface\nof sea, will not show up on radar scan\nfrom above.
19	2	Right, good thinking.
20	gl1	Before proceed to explain nitty-gritty,\nwe must make ship ship-shape.
21	gl1	Friends have to help also.
22	8	It not run as is?
23	gl1	There not enough fuel for runnage\nof Boundary.
24	1	Ah, so that's the problem.
25	6	Sounds like you need some good\nold-fashioned physical labor. Sign me up!
26	gl1	Samon happy to see friend so enthusiastic!
27	gl1	Could never hope to even carry\n300 ether cylinder by own self,\nso things were looking choppy.
28	3	Th-th-three hundred?!
29	2	Do we really need that many...?
30	gl1	Friends must remember, once depart\non ship, there nowhere to top up before\nland of destination.
31	1	That does make sense...
32	5	Sure, but where the spark are we gonna\nfind that many cylinders?
33	gl1	Not here, that for sure.\nWe pour all fuel we had into\nmaking prototype.
34	4	In other words... We have to figure out\nthe whole supply chain from nothing?
35	gl1	Perish thought, friend!
36	gl1	Samon never expect friends\ncould provide alone.
37	gl1	Only need to assist associate of Samon.
38	gl1	Would like friends to go see Timna\nand explain situation.
39	2	And that person can get us the cylinders?
40	gl1	Assuredly! Timna come from\none of Six mighty Houses.
41	gl1	Should be no big deal to part with\nhundred ether cylinder, or even thousand.
42	6	What are these Six Houses?
43	gl1	Very fancy houses, in holding of\nvery important people.
44	2	All right, we got it.\nWhere can we find this Timna?
45	gl1	In Caelum Residential Quarter of City.
46	1	Great. Let's go, then.
evt/sq/msg_sq000702f.json
0	1	Ms. Timna?\nWe've come on an errand from Samon.
1	il1	Oh, really? And what might he need?
2	1	Well, he's found himself quite urgently\nneeding a large quantity of fuel, so...
3	il1	I don't need the preambles, duck.
4	il1	This is Samon we're talking about,\nI'm sure he's got a whole lot of guff\nto sell me.
5	2	Well, I wouldn't quite-
6	il1	It's quite all right.\nWhat's he after? Tell me plainly.
7	1	300 ether cylinders...
8	il1	Planning something big again, isn't he?
9	il1	Not to worry.\nI'll have them prepared.
10	il1	...Or, well, I'd love to do that for you,\nbut lately, the conservative lot have been\nbuzzing around. Such a pain.
11	il1	The truth is, we haven't been able to\nsecure a surplus for ourselves, either.
12	6	The conserva-what now?
13	4	They're the people who don't\nwelcome war, perhaps.
14	il1	It seems you know enough to recognize,\nnot all of this great City's people think the\nsame way.
15	il1	Some are happy to remain spectators in\nthe conflict taking place outside our door.\nNot fight Moebius, maintain the status quo...
16	il1	They want nothing more than to seal the\nCity's hatches, build up our defenses.\nLots of conservative people like that here.
17	il1	But do pardon an old woman for\nthat tangent. We were talking\nabout ether cylinders...
18	il1	Their lot has been stockpiling more than\nthey need, all just to cock a snook at us.\nYou should get what you need from them.
19	3	Huh? Didn't you just say you\ndidn't like each other...?
20	il1	That doesn't mean there aren't any\nsensible people on that side too.
21	4	I see... So even your separate factions\nare comprised of varying types, then?
22	1	Well, maybe we should pay a visit to one\nof these sensible people, then!
23	il1	Please do.
24	il1	Speak to Miyori. She's the person in charge\nof the material storage warehouse.
25	il1	If you tell her that "the Nopon's needs\nare many", the conversation should go\nsmoothly.
26	6	"The Nopon's needs are many"...?
27	il1	The material storage warehouse is outside\nthe City. Mind how you go.
28	1	Understood. Thanks for your help.
evt/sq/msg_sq000703f.json
0	3	Hey, are you Miyori?
1	ml1	What?
2	1	Ms. Timna sent us.
3	1	We're trying to get some ether cylinders...
4	ml1	Timna did...?
5	ml1	Well, is that all? She didn't give you\na message or something?
6	1	Huh? A message?
7	3	Don't think I remember anything like that...
8	ml1	Right. No deal, then.\nYou can leave now.
9	5	Whuh?!
10	4	Look, this isn't what we were told...
11	ml1	I'm a busy gal, OK?\nBeat it.
12	2	Hey, wait!
13	8	Suggest to abandon hope.
14	9	She give coldest shoulder.
15	6	Erm...
16	6	Oh, right! She said to mention that\n"the Nopon needs his money"!
17	ml1	...!
18	ml1	Is that really what she said? To the word,\nto the letter? Are you sure?
19	6	Huh? Oh, uhhh...\nWas it "needs are many", instead?
20	ml1	Yes. Now I get it.
21	ml1	I'll get them ready for you.
22	6	Really?! Thanks so much!
23	9	Great success!
24	4	...I see. So that's what she meant by\n"the conversation going smoothly".
25	5	Huh?
26	9	It mean this person big Nopon fan!\nOnly reasonable, really.
27	ml1	So, how many do you need?
28	1	Erm, 300 ether cylinders.\nIs that...manageable...?
29	ml1	I'll check. Hold tight.
30	ml1	Also, don't let anyone near the storage.
31	1	Sure thing...
32	5	Don't let anyone near?\nPfft, like anyone'd bother coming out here\nwithout a rock-solid reason...
33	4	It sounded like the faction she belongs to\ndoesn't want any involvement with us.
34	4	I imagine she doesn't want to be\nsuspected of helping Ouroboros.
35	5	Hmph... Well then, should we give her\na hand? The faster it's done, the sooner\nwe can be out of her hair.
36		What should we do?
37		Help her
38		Stay put
39	1	You're right. We did ask for quite a few...
40	2	It'll go quicker with more hands, right?
41	4	She said to not let anyone near.\nI would assume that includes us?
42	3	Yeah, let's keep watch like we were told.
43	2	...Huh?
44	6	Something up, Mimi?
45	2	I just heard something.\nIt's coming this way...
46	5	Whoa! Check 'em out...
47	6	Why are they so big...?
48	1	Let's take them out before things get messy.
49	2	I'm with you!
evt/sq/msg_sq000704f.json
0	ml1	I heard a ruckus out here.\nAnything I need to worry about?
1	5	Not even slightly.\nNobody's here.
2	ml1	Right.
3	ml1	I've prepared the ether cylinders.\nTake them and go.
4	1	Thanks.
evt/sq/msg_sq000706t.json
0	gl1	Go to Caelum Residential Quarter.\nTimna live there.
1	gl1	Look for house with staircase.

1	il1	Miyori can a bit forceful, but that's just\nbecause she takes her job seriously.
2	il1	If you tell her "the Nopon's needs\nare many", she should help you\nreadily enough.
3	il1	Sounds like the procurement\nwent well enough? Do tell\nMonica to bill me, please.
4	il1	Oh, and... Guernica chose you for Ouroboros,\ndidn't he? Well then, just between us, I hope\nyou'll blossom beautifully.
evt/sq/msg_sq000708t.json
0	ml1	Tell you the truth, I'm keeping an eye\non the conservatives for Timna.
1	ml1	As far as I can tell, they gathered all those\nether cylinders hoping to introduce a few\nmore Levnises for the garrison.
2	ml1	It's all for the City folk's protection,\nso we'll have to replace them later...
evt/sq/msg_sq000801f.json
0	1	Hm...
1	6	...There's nobody here?
2	9	Puzzles...
3	D	This is definitely the rendezvous point.
4	D	You guys take a load off.\nJansen and I will look around.
5	vl1	This is definitely the rendezvous point.
6	vl1	You guys take a load off.\nI'll take a look around.
7	1	Sure thing.
evt/sq/msg_sq000802f.json
0	D	Good, everyone's here.
1	vl1	Everyone's here. Good.
2	2	Is this the person that made it out of\nthe prison camp, then?
3	ti1	Kisame.
4	vl1	Right, sorry to rush you but\ncan you tell us about the camp?
5	ti1	I can. Let's see now...
6	ti1	Inside the camp, every prisoner is tracked\nusing identification devices.
7	ti1	You need those devices to move\naround the grounds.
8	ti1	But if you go anywhere you're not\nsupposed to, they'll trip the alarm and\nthe guards will come running.
9	3	So you can't go anywhere without\n'em, but they stop you escaping?\nCrafty so-and-sos...
10	1	So, how did you manage to escape?
11	ti1	I'll be honest, most of it was sheer luck.
12	ti1	I was working by the western gate,\nwhen I happened to notice that there\nwere fewer guards than normal...
13	ti1	I asked my mates to help,\nand we got me out, alone.
14	4	In other words, it wouldn't be feasible\nfor us to infiltrate by the same route\nyou used to leave.
15	ti1	I imagine it wouldn't, no.
16	5	In that case, why not drop the sneaky stuff\nand just get caught on purpose?
17	D	It's a decent idea.
18	D	But if the guards find out you're\nOuroboros, they could just execute\nyou on the spot.
19	D	Till you can get information out\nof Ghondor on the inside...
20	D	...you should probably avoid revealing to\nthe Agnians that you're Ouroboros.
21	vl1	If the guards figure out you're Ouroboros,\nthe plan's gonna fall to pieces. They'll just\nkill you right then and there.
22	vl1	At least until you can get information out\nof Ghondor on the inside...
23	vl1	...you can't let the Agnians know\nthat you're Ouroboros.
24	1	Hrm...
25	3	Right, so we're saying stealth's the only\nway to get everyone out safely, Ghondor\nincluded.
26	ti1	Since you've mentioned Ghondor...
27	ti1	We used to gather in the central cell block\nfor morning assembly, so it should be easy\nto make contact, provided you can get in.
28	vl1	Good info, thanks.
29	vl1	I suppose we'll need more data points\non the prison if we're to figure out a way\nof infiltrating it.
30	ti1	I figured you might say that, so\nI got busy while I waited here,\nobserving Agnian troops.
31	ti1	Seems to me you might have more luck\ngetting information from them, seeing as\nhow I only saw one part of the prison...
32	ti1	Can you see that island to the northwest?\nThat's Corne Island.
33	ti1	I saw the Agnian transport Balaena\nheading that way.
34	ti1	It's most likely a Levnis from the Castle, so\nif you can access a terminal or something,\nyou might be able to learn a thing or two?
35	ti1	And then, there's Thurbin Island,\nto the northeast.
36	ti1	It has the Erythia Relay Base on it,\npermanent garrison and all, so you won't\nhave trouble finding information there.
37	4	It sounds like we'll have to accept\na certain level of risk, since there\nis no other way.
38	3	We just want the info, right?\nWe can slip in and out without\ngetting caught, quick as you like.
39	4	Yes, I *would* like that, but\nhow likely does it sound...?
40	2	More data on the prison is important, sure,\nbut it won't mean much if we don't figure\nout how to circumvent the ID devices...
41	ti1	Here, you can use this.
42	ti1	This is the device they'd put on me.
43	ti1	And these...
44	ti1	These are the ones from my friends\nwho died in the camp...
45	ti1	Should be enough for all of you,\nand then some.
46	vl1	...Thanks, we appreciate it.
47	ll1	Jansen?
48	ll1	About those ID devices.\nMind letting me have a crack? I think I can\npull the warning systems out of 'em.
49	ll1	And since you need a few,\nI'd like to borrow Nissick.
50	vl1	Understood, thank you.\nSo, with the devices in Kryto's hands...
51	1	We'll see what we can find on\nCorne Island and Thurbin Island.
evt/sq/msg_sq000803f.json
0	1	OK, now... How do we get\ncloser to the Balaena...?
1	3	Queen's ruffles...!
2	6	We got found...
3	vl1	Wipe 'em out.
evt/sq/msg_sq000804f.json
0	1	No more enemies...?
1	1	Good. Let's check inside the ship.
2	2	I think some of us should stand\nguard outside.
3	5	All right, I'll be the lookout.
4	6	Me too!
evt/sq/msg_sq000805f.json
0	3	So, what's our loot from the Balaena\nlookin' like? A survey sketch of the Agnus\nCastle Barbican...? Now we're talkin'!
1	4	And yet, it doesn't enable us\nto build a plan on its own.
2	4	If possible, I'd like us to gather\nfurther intelligence before acting.
3	3	Bah... Always with the caution, this bloke.
4	1	This time around, we'll need as much\ncaution as we can muster, Eunie.
5	1	We might be able to find more\ninformation at the Erythia Relay\nBase on Thurbin Island.
6	2	That's right. Let's follow\nall the leads we have.
7	1	We've got a good deal of info now.\nLet's go back to Kisame on Vinisog Holm.
evt/sq/msg_sq000806f.json
0	yl1	Huh... Not bad, not bad at all.
1	yl1	I've sent the data to your Irises.\nGive it a look over for me.
2	6	What's this...?\nA map of the prison camp?
3	5	If we can find a good insertion point,\nthis'll take us the rest of the way.
4	1	You're right. But for that, we'll need\na bit more information still.
5	2	There were supposed to be Agnian forces\non that other island, right? Let's see what\nwe can find there as well.
6	6	Corne Island, I think Kisame said?
7	1	Right. Let's investigate Corne Island, then.
8	1	We've got a good deal of info now.\nLet's go back to Kisame on Vinisog Holm.
evt/sq/msg_sq000807f.json
0	vl1	OK, tell me what you know.
1	yl1	Let me send you what Taion and I\ngot from analyzing the maps.
2	4	First, about infiltrating the island itself...\nIt appears that there are natural caverns\ndirectly underneath Agnus Castle.
3	4	If we break through one of the walls,\nthen climb the cliffs, we can avoid\nmost of the guards' attention.
4	1	There should be even less chance\nof us getting caught if we do it under\ncover of darkness.
5	ti1	I seem to remember a little inlet\nnear Hykt's Cove.
6	ti1	It could be a good place\nto wait for nightfall.
7	4	Once we've ascended the cliffside,\nwe can approach the camp from the back.
8	4	Notice the air vents? I expect one of\nthose is our way in.
9	5	That's quite a drop.
10	4	Indeed. They won't be any use for\nexfiltration. Those ID devices are\ncertainly going to be a help.
11	yl1	Well if they're not and you're spotted,\nyou'll all be rounded up in seconds.
12	3	So, assuming we get into the prison,\nhow exactly are we supposed to\nblend in?
13	ti1	See how the vents also connect\nto the central cell block?
14	ti1	It should be easy for you to mingle\nwhen the prisoners are all in one place\nfor morning assembly.
15	yl1	After that, you can move about in the open,\ncalm as you like. As long as you've got an\nID device, they won't suspect a thing.
16	vl1	Once you're inside, you should\nmake contact with Ghondor as\nsoon as possible...
17	vl1	I've prepared a few possible plans\nof action for when you're ready to\nleave the camp.
18	vl1	You'll need to change plans as the\nsituation demands. Everyone needs\nto play their part.
19	D	Once you're on Agnian soil,\nI'll head back to the City and stand by.
20	vl1	If you manage to extract Ghondor without\ncausing too much noise, we can\nrendezvous at Patulia Bay.
21	vl1	And if you don't, well...
22	ti1	If you don't, you just dive right into\nthe water below the western gate,\nand we'll come fish you out.
23	D	Give 'em a good booting from me, eh?
24	vl1	If you can get out quietly, head\nfor Patulia Bay, where you'll\nrendezvous with Kisame.
25	vl1	But top priority is breaking out Ghondor.\nBlast the western gate off, if you must.
26	1	Well, it seems like we've got\nour plan in place.
27	8	Riku roger that. When preparations ready,\nwe take Boundary to Hykt's Cove.
evt/sq/msg_sq000810t.json
0	ti1	Keep an eye out when disembarking on\nCorne Island and Thurbin Island.
1	ti1	If you're spotted, be sure to squash\n'em all so they don't get a chance to\nnotify the Castle. I'm sure you understand.
evt/sq/msg_sq000811t.json
0	ll1	I'll have the ID devices taken care of\nby the time you're back.
1	ll1	Mark my words, we won't let the\nsacrifice of those that wore them\ngo to waste...
evt/sq/msg_sq000812t.json
0	xl1	Don't waste time chatting.\nYou have work to do.
evt/sq/msg_sq000900f.json
0	@j1	Good morning, prisoners!\nHow are you this fine morning?
1	@j1	It's a good day to show gratitude to your\njailers! We let you keep your criminal lives,\nleast you can do is work till you die!
2	@j1	Them wot don't work, don't eat!\nAnd so, without further ado,\nhere's your work details for today.
3	Yj1	Today's food-gathering duty is in the\nPerimeter Woodland. You're to team up\nbased on your assigned cell.
4	Yj1	First, gather 20 each of Carnomiles,\nGold Burdocks, Peachy Truffles, and\nHoney Plums. That is all.
5	Yk1	Phew, sounds like another breezy\none today!
6	Wk1	Oh, for sure. Might even be able to\nsneak in a napperoo, dontcha think?
7	3	Bleh... Seems plenty rough to me.
8	5	Same. I don't even wanna think what\na hard day's work looks like here...
9	2	Something wrong, Taion?
10	4	Those foodstuffs that the guard named...
11	4	It's the exact same food that the\nCastle distributes to us.
12	6	Hey, does that mean...\nThe food the colonies receive,\nit's all picked here?!
13	4	It would be the natural conclusion...
14	1	So they're using the Lost Numbers\nas free labor...
15	2	...
16	Yj1	We're now opening the gate\nto the Perimeter Woodland.
17	Yj1	And no funny business, you hear me?\nAnyone acts suspicious, they get taken out.\nEnd of.
18	2	We're supposed to keep our heads down\nuntil we can execute the plan...
19	1	Let's just head for the woodland.
evt/sq/msg_sq000901f.json
0	1	We've collected our quota.
1	Yj1	Let me be the judge of that.
2	Yj1	All right then, here's the list\nfor the next batch...
3	5	Wha-?!\nWe worked our arses off,\nand now you want more?!
4	Yj1	You got a problem with that?\nFeel free to die if you prefer.
5	Yj1	We're keeping you alive outta the\ngoodness of our bleedin' hearts.\nYou wanna stay that way, you work.
6	5	What did you just-
7	1	Hey, we need to lay low\nuntil...you know.
8	Yj1	Right, that'll do it.\nWork's over for today.
9	Yj1	Back to your cells, you animals.
10	3	Eugh... I stink of dirt...
11	6	We gotta stay patient. Just two more days.
12	2	It's inconceivable... All the people here\nhave had to work like this every day...?
13	4	They're being seen as expendable\nlabor. I imagine the overseers don't\neven consider them human.
14	1	...
15	1	We need to keep our strength up\nfor tomorrow. Time to call it a night.
16	2	Yeah. You're right.
evt/sq/msg_sq000902t.json
0	1	Is this what prison work is always like?
1	Yk1	Yeah, man. Some days, instead of\npicking food, it's mining for resources.
2	Yk1	Either way, a full hard day's labor.
3	1	I see...
4	Yk1	You haven't picked your share yet, right?
5	Yk1	Here, have this.
6	1	Are you sure?
7	Yk1	We don't want you too tired\nwhen the breakout happens, yeah?
8	1	Thanks. This will definitely help.
9	Yk1	Even if they kill us, they won't get any of\nthose life motes out of it, huh? That's why\nthey're working us like beasts of burden.
10	Yk1	We'll show those Agnian bastards that\nwe've no intention of being their little\nplaythings for much longer.
evt/sq/msg_sq000903t.json
0	1	Have you lived here long?
1	Xk1	Not as long as I spent fighting, before.
2	Xk1	I heard you lot are planning to escape.\nGuess you'll be going back into battle?\nThat's kinda impressive.
3	1	Why?
4	Xk1	I haven't been here too long,\nbut long enough to work out\none thing.
5	Xk1	I was tired of having to fight for my life.
6	Xk1	...Ah! Sorry, I didn't mean to keep you.\nIt was just nice to have someone to talk to.
7	Xk1	You've still got more stuff to pick, right?\nHere you go, then.
8	Xk1	Good luck getting the rest.
9	Xk1	You know, I wanted to be a soldier.\nI wanted to do my part for the City...
10	Xk1	Never thought it'd end with\nme here, though...
evt/sq/msg_sq000904t.json
0	1	Did you guys grow these?
1	Wk1	Yeah. The soil's decent to begin with,\nso it wasn't too much of a hassle.
2	Wk1	But it does piss me off to think\nthey're filling up the guards'\nstomachs too...
3	Wk1	Here, you guys can grab a few.\nIt's those same Gold Burdocks\nthey had you picking.
4	1	Thank you, so much.
5	Wk1	Can't quite believe I'll be seeing the back\nof this place in a few days. Wish I could\ntake this soil with me when I go...
6	Wk1	Much as it hurts to admit,\nit'll never make much difference\nwhether I fight or not.
7	Wk1	But the food I grow will serve to\nkeep folks alive, and that's no small\nthing, either.
evt/sq/msg_sq000905t.json
0	1	What were you looking at?
1	_j1	Just noting the guards' positions.
2	_j1	I want to be of use when you're\nbreaking Ghondor out of here.
3	1	Right, OK...
4	_j1	Anyway, that's what I'm doing, and it'd\nserve my purposes to be inconspicuous.
5	_j1	Not to be rude, but would you\nplease go work somewhere else?
6	1	We'll be sure to do that.
7	_j1	...Oh, hey, wait.\nTake these.
8	_j1	Whenever there're prisoners talking,\nit's just a matter of time before guards\nshow up.
9	_j1	We don't want them twigging on\nto our plans, now do we? So go.
10	_j1	The guards here are somehow surviving\nwithout stealing lives on the battlefield.
11	_j1	Maybe that explains why the level\nof discipline is so vastly lower here\nthan in other outfits...
12	_j1	Still, we can't afford to get complacent.
evt/sq/msg_sq000906t.json
0	1	Ghondor, I wanted to talk strategy.\nAbout this plan in two days' time...
1	oV	Strategy, shmategy.\nI already told you yesterday.
2	oV	If we keep nattering, the guards'll\ngive us grief. Just keep your heads\ndown and do some work.
3	1	Work? OK, fine, but what should we do...?
4	oV	Huh? Why're you asking me?\nI look like a model prisoner to you?
5	oV	If you're so keen, go chat at some\nof the other losers slackin' about.

0	Yj1	You're not done yet, are you?\nBack to work, you reprobates!
1	Yj1	Oh, you're pretty new here, are you?\nWell, I don't snuffing care. Ask some of\nthe other prisoners if you need anything.
evt/sq/msg_sq001000f.json
0	Yj1	The job today is culling the\nFeris population living in\nthe Perimeter Woodland.
1	Yj1	Anyone who kills a Feris will be excused\nfrom other duties for the rest of the day.\nMake sure to bring proof when reporting in.
2	Yj1	Not just any Feris though! The idea is to\neradicate the ones that are going berserk.
3	5	Well, that's much more like it!\nNo more digging in the dirt like yesterday.
4	Yj1	The Ferises are reported to have mauled\na large number of people yesterday.\nHave fun out there!
5	_j1	Why don't you use your Levnises?\nIt'd make quick work of them.
6	Yj1	Any units assigned here are being prepared\nfor the war games tomorrow.
7	Yj1	Even if they weren't, why bother wheeling\nout the big guns for something this trivial?\nEspecially when we've got you lot.
8	Yj1	Now get out there - the day's a-wasting.\nAnyone found disobeying orders will be\nterminated on sight!
9	3	He sounded pretty gleeful about that,\ndon't you think?
10	5	Gleeful's the word, yeah. All he's gonna have\nto do is sit back and enjoy the show while\nwe're out there, fighting crazed Ferises.
11	4	I cannot understand how one can\nderive any pleasure from such a\ncruel pastime...
12	1	Still, we ought to move out.

4	1	We better run after it.
5	6	Uhm, what about these folks here...?
6	Q	I'm touched by your concern, but they're\nexperienced soldiers, all right?
7	6	But...!
8	Q	C'mon, you lousy grunts!\nYou gonna keel over from tiny\nscratches like that?! Pathetic!
9	Q	You get up right now, or so help me,\nI'll tear you limb from limb and feed you\nto the Ferises my-bloody-self!
10	Yk1	Urk...
11	Q	Lazy gits, I swear...
12	Q	I'll pile 'em up somewhere outta the way,\nthen I'll come find you.
13	Q	Go on ahead now.\nDon't waste the head-start.
14	1	...As you say.
evt/sq/msg_sq001003f.json
0	6	We caught up with it.
1	1	Good. Now let's take it out\nbefore it hurts anyone else!
evt/sq/msg_sq001004f.json
0	3	Phew... We took it down somehow.
1	5	They sure don't mess about with\nthe work detail here...
2	4	Our duty is accomplished.\n...What now?
3	1	We should probably go report it, but-
4	Q	Oh, what? You already took it out?
5	Q	But I barely got to go nuts yet!
6	2	"Go nuts"...?\nYou really have a taste for battle...
7	Q	Ah well, what's done is done.\nYou dags better hop to it\nand report to the guard.
8	1	Huh? Are you sure?
9	Q	Sure I'm sure.\nYou earned it, didn't ya?
10	Q	Anyhow, since there's not a lot of attention\non this place now, we'll take a look around\nand scope things out for tomorrow.
11	1	All right, if that's how you want to play it...
evt/sq/msg_sq001005f.json
0	1	We've defeated a Feris\nthat had gone wild.
1	Yj1	Oh, you have, have you?\nWhere's the proof?
2	3	Here you go, the thing's horns.
3	Yj1	Pfft, you coulda taken that\nfrom any old Feris. It won't\ncount as proof for me.
4	3	You wot...?
5	3	What the ever-snuffing sparks?\nThat guy really gets on my wings...
6	1	Nothing to be done. Let's go back and\nlook for something that'll convince him.
7	5	Ugh... More walking? Great...
evt/sq/msg_sq001006f.json
0	1	Oh, you're done already?
1	Q	Pretty much. More importantly,\nwhat are you lot doing out here?
2	2	Let me explain...
3	Q	Well, sure sounds like that guard gets off\non messing with you guys...
4	Q	Take these.
5	1	Huh...?
6	Q	You give him those, even he'll\nhave to leave ya alone.
7	2	Thanks for that.
evt/sq/msg_sq001007f.json
0	1	Here, proof that we did what we said.
1	Yj1	Hrmm...
2	Yj1	Well I'll be. It looks like you really\ndid take down that Feris.
3	Yj1	I'm a man of my word.\nYou're relieved of duties\nfor the rest of today.
4	Q	Sounds like you did well.
5	1	Thanks for the help, Ghondor.
6	Q	Don't even mention it. Besides,\nI also wanted time to talk about\ntomorrow.
7	4	Good point. I do want us to\ngo over the details together.
evt/sq/msg_sq001008t.json
0	oV	I need to get these poor bastards\nto safety, then I'll follow you.
1	oV	You dags go on ahead -\nI'll be with you shortly.
evt/sq/msg_sq001009t.json
0	oV	We're gonna have a look around\nbefore heading back.
1	oV	Go on, I bet the guard's just\ndying to hear your report.
evt/sq/msg_sq001100f.json
0	Yj1	Here is your duty for today:\nyou are to gather Beautiful Shoots\nand Fluffy Cloud Ears.
1	Yj1	Furthermore, the following is an assignment\nfor the prisoners who defeated the Feris\nyesterday.
2	Yj1	You are tasked with culling the Garaffas\ngrazing near the Perimeter Outlet.
3	1	Wait, just us...?
4	Yj1	Once the Garaffas are culled,\nyou are to also cull the Quadwings.\nFinally, tidy up the Food Storage area.
5	Yj1	Once you're done with that,\nyou're on the usual duties with\nthe rest of the prisoners.
6	Yj1	That's all. You're dismissed.\nNow get to work.
7	3	Ugh. That pillock expects us\nto deal with all that ourselves...?
8	5	We've been such model prisoners.\nBet he's taken a shine to us.
9	2	We should go too.
10	1	Yeah.
evt/sq/msg_sq001101f.json
0	6	M'kay, that's one job down.
1	5	Still no signal, eh...
2	1	I wonder if something's gone wrong...
3	4	We can't afford to arouse suspicion before\nwe receive our orders. We'll just have to\nendure the work, loathsome as it is.
4	3	Blahh, for real now...?
5	2	Hmm...
evt/sq/msg_sq001200f.json
0	gl1	W-wait! Hold Ponios!\nSamon think Samon deserve\nsome kind of explanation!
1	1	Ah, right. Here's the thing...
2	gl1	...Now Samon get it.\nSo, friends want to use ship.
3	gl1	Well then, that only mean one thing!
4	gl1	To make friends' search for core parts\neasier, Samon must update data from\npreviously.
5	3	How's that?
6	gl1	Data derived from observe source could\nonly show broad-strokes position. But now,\nSamon will make data more precise.
7	gl1	Currently, can only constrain to area\nof about 2000 square metri.
8	gl1	But with bit more elbow grease,\nshould be able to increase accuracy\nto within 200 metri!
9	5	That's...good, right?\nThis'll be a walk in the park then!
10	gl1	Indeedy-do!
11	4	It might take us less time than\nI'd anticipated.
12	2	Right!
13	6	Mr. Samon, sir, you're sort of\nour hero right now!
14	gl1	So, friends currently have any ideas?
15	1	Definitely. We know who has\nthe part in the Aetia region.
16	1	We should go there now.
17	gl1	Splendid! Then while friends itinerate,\nSamon will analyze remaining locations.
18	gl1	Will send details when ready.\nHope friends excited!
19	1	Thank you, Mr. Samon.
20	2	All right then, let's get going.
21	1	Yeah. First stop, the Cloudkeep!
evt/sq/msg_sq001201f.json
0	6	That's the first bit of Origin metal\ntaken care of!
1	1	Oh, a call from Mr. Samon!
2	gl106gl10	Meh-llo?\nFriends find first part now?
3	50350	Yeah, just a moment ago.\nYou've got good timing, man!
4	gl104gl10	What friend saying? Samon placed\ncall after see source of signal moving.\nVery evident proof of obtain.
5	50350	Oh... Well, uh, you know\nwhat I say to that? Meh!
6	4	His sensors could detect such a small\ndisplacement? Truly impressive...
7	10310	Mr. Samon, I'm guessing\nsince you called us...
8	gl104gl10	Ah, yes! Have finished location\ndata analysis.
9	gl104gl10	...For only two places, however.
10	gl104gl10	In north of Aetia region,\nand east of Cadensia region.
11	gl104gl10	Those two signals, Samon could\ntriangulate for more precision. Data\njust updated, so please to check.
12	10310	We got it. Thanks again, Mr. Samon.
13	gl108gl10	Not to worries.\nPlease to keep up good work!
14	2	So, Aetia and Cadensia next, huh?
15	4	The one in Aetia is...\nHuh, in Everblight Plain...?
16	4	And for Cadensia, data seems to be\npointing to Cape Arcaphor in the\nErythia Sea.
17	3	Right-o!\nLet's get on with it, loves.
evt/sq/msg_sq001202f.json
0	8	Oho! Signal of Origin metal coming clear.\nMust be near now.
1	8	This starting to feel like treasure hunt.\nRiku get kind of excited.
2	5	You know, you've got a point.\nIt *is* kinda like one big world-hopping\ntreasure-hunting adventure.
3	3	All right, calm down.\nWhere's the signal, then?
4	8	It coming from over that way.
5	8	If judge by distance reading,\nprobably behind that ridge.
6	6	Hey Manana, race you for it!
7	9	OK, but Manana not give up easy!
evt/sq/msg_sq001203f.json
0	1	I guess this is it...?
1	6	Together with the one we got from\nHer Majesty, that makes two.
2	4	It's good luck that we found it so quickly.\nWe can only hope the other pieces will\ncome to us just as smoothly...
3	2	Let's track down the metal in Cadensia.
4	1	All right!
5	5	That's the, uh...third one, right?
6	3	Half down, half to go.
7	8	Meh? Oh, new data just arrive\nfrom Samon.
8	1	It looks like we're going to...\nthe Pentelas region, and Fornis.
9	2	This part of Pentelas...\nIt's Maktha Wildwood, I think?
10	6	And as for Fornis, looks like\nZain's Talon.
evt/sq/msg_sq001204f.json
0	8	Oho! Location of treasure is\nseemingly behind waterfall!
1	2	That's unexpected...
2	3	Explains how it went undiscovered,\nat least.
3	1	All right, let's go.
evt/sq/msg_sq001205f.json
0	2	Got it!
1	6	Together with the one we got from\nHer Majesty, that makes two.
2	4	It's good luck that we found it so quickly.\nWe can only hope the other pieces will\ncome to us just as smoothly...
3	2	Let's track down the metal in Aetia.

evt/sq/msg_sq001206f.json
0	8	Hrumm...
1	8	Very strange. Riku see reading of Origin\nmetal, but not anything that could fit bill.
2	4	The coordinate data does seem to be\npointing us here...
3	5	That mean Mr. Samon's done goofed?
4	2	It doesn't seem very likely...\n...Well, not *too* likely, at least...
5	1	Is it possible that it could be\nburied under the surface...?
6	3	Oh, you've got to be joking.\nPlease don't tell me we're gonna\nhave to dig this whole place up.
7	6	Dig the whole place up, got it!
8	3	Queen's cuticles, I'm gonna hate this...
evt/sq/msg_sq001207f.json
0	6	Let's try digging here first.
1	5	I'm not looking forward to that, somehow...
2	6	Here it is!
3	4	That's the fourth one.
4	8	Not long now!
5	3	So, Pentelas region next...?
6	2	Only one left to go.
7	2	We got some new data from Mr. Samon...
8	1	The final piece of Origin metal\nis waiting for us in...
evt/sq/msg_sq001208f.json
0	8	Riku check and double-check,\nbut bad news is same. Signal come\nfrom that Rhana...
1	9	That mean Rhana ate it?
2	4	Based on the circumstances, that\ndoes seem to be the firmest hypothesis\nwe have...
3	5	'Kay, well, let's just punch it in the gut\nand see what comes up!
4	3	Blergh... Dibs, not me!\nNot touching it, no way no how.
evt/sq/msg_sq001209f.json
0	5	Origin metal, lovely jubbly.
1	3	...How can you handle that\nwith a straight face?
2	5	You want a closer look?
3	3	Stop it! Keep that thing away\nfrom me, you clod!
4	4	That's the fourth one.
5	8	Not long now!
6	6	Next one is in the Fornis region.
7	2	Only one left to go.
8	2	We got some new data from Mr. Samon...
9	1	The final piece of Origin metal\nis waiting us in...
evt/sq/msg_sq001211t.json
0	1	We've collected all the\nOrigin metal fragments.
1	gl1	Samon know. Have been watching\nwhole of exploits through terminal.
2	gl1	Oh, and what sight it was!\nFriends are amazing!
3	gl1	And so...\nWith this, Samon can create engine\nlikes of which was before only dream.
4	gl1	So friends just leave rest to Samon.
5	gl1	Will need bit of time to complete\nship project. Friends can kick back\nuntil it ready.

evt/tlk/msg_tlk021702.json
0	aW1	Are you going to make an end o' Z?
1	aW1	It'll be the mother of all battles,\nand no mistake!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk021703.json
0	aW1	Off searching for more booty, are ye?
1	aW1	Perhaps we ought to go at it again!\nOuroboros versus the Triton family!
2	aW1	How about it, you mangy\ncrew o' landlubbers?!
3	6	You bet we won't lose this time either, you...\nbunch of...bilge-slurping...sea-swaggle!
4	4	Sena might be interested...\nBut I think she'd be the only one.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk021704.json
0	aW1	Jaggar be cut from the selfsame\nsailcloth as ye, that be certain.
1	aW1	Jaggar's way o' looking at things is this:\nLife may be long, may be short, but what\nmatters is what you live it for. Same as ye!
2	aW1	Aye, the right purpose o' life is to make it\nfull and rich, and make the folks around\nyou strong and sturdy.

0	uV	Can I...come along with you guys?
1	uV	I want to find out about Moebius.\nI'll do whatever it takes to help you out!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk021802.json
0	uV	I decided to hang on to\nIrma's key for a while.
1	uV	When everyone's ready, I'd like to\ntalk about if we should bury it in the\nflower garden or not.
2	6	OK. And, uh, what if no one's\ndown with that?
3	uV	Well, if that's how it goes,\nthen I'll hang on to it.
4	uV	I just think it's important that everyone\ngets to see Irma... Both the good and\nthe bad.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk021803.json
0	6	Hey, Fiona! That circular battle formation?\nWay cool!
1	uV	Huh, really? So nice of you to say, Sennie!
2	uV	Hey, why don't you try it too?\nYou could coordinate with Lan-Lan!
3	5	Uh? You want me to get in on the action?
4	uV	Yeah! Lan-Lan's gonna sulk if Sennie\ngets to play and he doesn't!\nC'mon! I'll teach you!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk021804.json
0	5	Sorry about Triton.\nHe really gave you the runaround, huh.
1	uV	No, it's not like that! I think I learned\nsomething because of the Cap'n.
2	uV	I learned that even Moebius have\na heart and feelings... That it's not\nimpossible for us to see eye-to-eye.
3	uV	They aren't so different from us.\nIt made me want to know more\nabout them.
4	5	Haha... Y'know, Fiona, your way of thinking\nreally comes in handy sometimes.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk021805.json
0	uV	I don't think I'd be here now if it wasn't\nfor running into you guys.
1	uV	That's why I want to do everything\nI can to help you get the future that\neveryone's dreaming of!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk021901.json

1	6	Yeah, sounds good.\nNo point hanging around here forever...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk021902.json
0	zV	A large-scale facility such as this\nis also ideal for Ferron upkeep.
1	zV	Ferron unit No. 7 is in prime condition.\nIf required in battle, do not hesitate to\nissue an immediate order.
2	zV	To provide auxiliary support to Ouroboros\nis a deep-rooted desire of mine.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk021903.json
0	dW1	Proposal. I will conclude the financial\ntransaction that Wheelideeli requires.
1	6	But, Segiri...\nYou don't have any cash, right?
2	dW1	Affirmative. However, there may be\nalternative means of raising funds.
3	6	Don't worry about it, really.\nI'm sure we'll be able to cover\nthe costs ourselves.
4	dW1	I...I am sorry. Then I will find some other,\nguaranteed way to make recompense.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk021904.json
0	zV	I surmise various issues to have\nemerged while No. 13 was missing,\njust as with our unit.
1	zV	No. 13 still requires some time to\nrestore balance to her emotions.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk021905.json
0	zV	The names that Sena contrived have been\nwell received by everyone. She more than\nadequately performed her assigned task.
1	zV	And it was not merely the name.\nAll our achievements to date could\nnot have been performed alone.
2	zV	I, too, hope to spend - or even expend -\nmy life engaging in the grand struggle\nbetween Ouroboros and Moebius.
3	6	Thank you. I know you've\ngot our backs, Segiri!
4	zV	Affirmative. Ferron unit No. 7 will\ncontinue to provide all-purpose support.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk022001.json
0	oV	Look at that. A real critical mass of\nweapons-grade arseholes, if I ever\nsaw one.
1	1	Pardon...?
2	oV	This was all Bitchqueen's idea, wasn't it?\nDon't be getting any ideas, will ya?

evt/tlk/msg_tlk022002.json

evt/tlk/msg_tlk022005.json
0	oV	Hey.
1	5	Yeah, what now?
2	oV	You ain't looking too peachy right now.\nI don't think you should be gettin' out\nthere. You might break something.
3	3	Wait a sec, Ghondor's worried about\nus now...? What, is it going to snow or\nsomething?
4	oV	Don't get any weird ideas. We just don't\nneed the hassle of cleaning up the mess\nwhen you lot die like dogs on the wayside.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk022006.json
0	oV	Why'd I get the feeling you bunch of\nno-marks are gonna mess this little stunt\nright up? You want me to tag along?
1	3	Ghondor, you're dishing out a lot\nof these little digs lately. You got a\nSkeeter in your slacks or something?
2	oV	Shut it, will ya?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk022007.json
0	oV	We got most of the Lost Numbers\nsafely back to the City now.

0	1	Thanks for all your hard work,\nGhondor. Seems like things are\ncoming together in the City.
1	oV	Yeah, feels like we got a good chunk\nof what needs to be done boxed off. It's\njust the tip of the iceberg though, right?
2	oV	Can't just get to a milestone and then\ncall it quits. We gotta keep battling on!

3	lW1	Nah, not likely! There's no way I'm up to\nsnuff for that right now. I'm just focusing\non the dirty work at the moment.

1	XX1	Yeah! Plants always give back\nif you take proper care of them.
2	XX1	They've shown me that I need to look\nforward, not back... That maybe I can\nkeep living into the future.
3	XX1	They've even helped me face up\nto my role as an off-seer, too.
4	XX1	You gave me a lot of advice when\nI was having those worries. I can't\nthank you enough.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110103.json
0	XX1	The folks at Colony Mu are mostly\nyounger, like me. I was surprised\nabout that.
1	XX1	People have some pretty neat ideas here.\nThey wondered whether changing the\nfertilizer might affect the potatoes' flavor.
2	XX1	It was an interesting idea, so I'm going\nto see if I can get permission from the\ncommander to try that myself.
3	XX1	If it goes well, I'll be sure to sling\na bit of produce your way, Noah!
4	1	Cool! I'll look forward to that.

4	YX1	Thanks. That means a lot.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110203.json
0	YX1	Colony Gamma's located on the\nnorthern bank of Alfeto Valley.\nIt's an Agnian colony.
1	YX1	The original plan was to battle them there.\nBut by the time Noah's party had got back,\nanother colony had muscled in.
2	YX1	You guys used to be stationed\nat Gamma, right?
3	YX1	It's a good thing you liberated the colony\nbefore this turned into a full-blown war.
4	2	Yeah... You're right about that.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110204.json
0	YX1	There haven't been any new recruits since\nwe broke off relations with the Castle...
1	5	Who's the youngest person\nin Colony 9 these days?
2	YX1	That would be Url.\nHe was the last one to join us.
3	YX1	Of course, he doesn't have Noah's\nfighting ability. So defending him was\na really frantic affair.
4	YX1	No more fresh blood after Url.\nI suppose we've just got to make\ndo with the numbers we have...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110205.json
0	YX1	Now the potatoes are growing,\nwe've gotten Colony 9 back on\nan even keel, I think.
1	YX1	Some of the other colonies are cooperating\nwith each other now, right? I wonder if we\ncould get in on that too...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110206.json
0	YX1	I'm getting to know Url a lot better\nthan before. Our visit to Colony Mu\nhelped speed that along.
1	YX1	I was really impressed by how much\nhe knew about crops. Not only that,\nbut he's a great teacher, too.
2	YX1	Yes, Url's going to be a great asset\nin spreading potato cultivation.
3	3	Sure, but he's still gonna need\na bit of protection, right?

1	5	What are you doing, Eilis?

1	bX1	Ahh, it's been so long since I got to\neat till I was full. Can't even remember\nwhen the last time was.
2	bX1	Camilla went nuts for them.\nYou shoulda seen the smile on her face!
3	bX1	When I think about living this kind\nof life into the future, well... It makes\nme so happy, I could weep.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110601.json
0	cX1	If this mission is successful, the\ncolony's gonna move up to Iron rank\nfor sure!
1	cX1	The commander's in pretty good spirits\nat the moment. Hey, a royal decree is a\nroyal decree, after all!
2	cX1	Don't you guys be dragging your feet now!
3	3	Yeah, yeah. You be careful too, Kite.\nDon't chase after victory so hard you\nend up dead!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110602.json
0	cX1	Fair warning: I still haven't let\nyou guys off the hook.
1	cX1	I'm gonna put Colony 9 back in order,\nbut I'm gonna do it my way!
2	cX1	I can do it... I'm sure...\nIt won't be like before...
3	1	Kite...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110603.json
0	cX1	Urgh... Body's feeling rough...
1	cX1	Working the fields sure takes it\nright out of you.
2	5	You OK? Need a hand?
3	cX1	No, I'm good. I said I'd do it.\nGotta show a bit of heart if I'm\ngonna be the one tending to 'em.
4	cX1	Zeon's been doing this all by himself.\nCan you believe that? Don't know how\nhe didn't drop dead from exhaustion...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110604.json
0	cX1	These Spongy Spuds need a lot of care\nand attention, right? Maybe that's why\nI'm feeling like this.
1	cX1	I just get such a warm fuzzy feeling\nseeing the li'l spuds all harvested. Like\nI want to talk to them or something...
2	5	You're...talking to the potatoes?
3	cX1	Not literally, you doofus! I'm saying\nI feel so happy that I *could*!
4	cX1	So, uh...thanks, I guess.\nFor helping us out with all this.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110605.json
0	cX1	Huh? Juniper?!\nH-h-hello...!
1	L	Hey, Kite. Good to see you.\nHow are you?
2	cX1	D-doing good, thanks! Feeling\npretty healthy, thanks to all the\nSpongy Spuds!
3	L	Really? Well, I'm glad to hear it!
4	cX1	Arrgh... Pain...in chest...\nAm I gonna die...?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110606.json
0	cX1	Fields are pretty awesome, when you\nstop to think about it. It's a chance to\ncreate life from the ground up...
1	cX1	And us...we've learned to nurture life,\ninstead of taking it.
2	2	Heehee... Yes, I see that I'm looking\nat the face of a nurturer!
3	cX1	Ah, it's just so... I mean, when you\ncare for something deeply, the feelings\njust well up, y'know?
4	cX1	Yeah, Zeon got it right when he\ndecided to start working on these\nfields. I gotta acknowledge that.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110701.json
0	dX1	Hey, thanks for what you did in\nthat battle. We couldn't have made\nit back without you.
1	dX1	I mean, four Levnises from Colony\nSigma? I had no idea how I was\ngoing to handle that.
2	5	We don't have a whole lot of Levnises\nat our colony... I get how it can be a\nproblem.
3	dX1	Yeah... I wonder if we could get our\nhands on some reinforcements...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110702.json
0	dX1	Hey, Lanz! Be sure to take good care\nof our only off-seer, won't you?
1	5	I got it. Drawing enemy fire's the\nDefender's job, after all!
2	dX1	And make sure Eunie's looking out for\nyou, and not just Noah, yeah? Wounded\nDefenders still need healing!
3	3	Yeah, yeah. Don't worry.\nWe know what we're doing!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110703.json
0	dX1	I understand Zeon's way of thinking, really\nI do, but...will we really be able to subsist\nwithout support from the Castle?
1	dX1	We've fought Agnus tooth and nail up till\nnow. The Levnises, the food supply...\nNeither are in any kind of decent order.
2	dX1	The previous commander was a stern sort,\nbut he got the colony shipshape so we'd\nhave a shot at getting to Iron rank.
3	dX1	I hate to say it...but I'm not sure that\nZeon can shoulder this burden.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110704.json
0	dX1	Surprised to run into\nyou lot out here.
1	3	You've been collecting up\nmaterials, huh?
2	dX1	Yeah. If you look hard enough, you'll be\nsurprised by what's left over.
3	dX1	We've always been so laser-focused\non what we can get out of fighting and\nnothing else.
4	dX1	Keep your eyes peeled, and you\nnever know what you might find!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110705.json
0	2	Trish... When Kite started getting strange\nideas, why didn't you put a stop to it?
1	dX1	I suppose I just respected Kite's\nthoughts on the matter. Maybe I was\nbeing stubborn, too.
2	dX1	A long time ago, the colony was raided,\nand he took a big hit defending me. It was\nso bad, he had to be taken off the team.
3	dX1	Of course, he's a friend. But it feels\nlike... Like he's always been alone\nsomehow, you know?
4	dX1	So I want to stay on his side, even if the\nworld turns against him. There's not much\nmore to it than that.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110706.json
0	dX1	I get the feeling Kite's finally found\na niche for himself in Colony 9.
1	3	Yeah, that sure is a relief. But admit it,\nyou'll miss his shenanigans.
2	dX1	Maybe. But hey, he's not the only\ntroublemaker around this place...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110707.json
0	dX1	I really enjoy teaching useful stuff to\nothers. There's something so fulfilling\nabout it!
1	dX1	I've been thinking I'd like to see a few\nother colonies, besides Colony 4.
2	dX1	But I guess we need to defeat Moebius\nbefore I get to do anything like that.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110801.json
0	eX1	This mission'll be wrapped up\nin about three ticks.
1	5	Three ticks seems a bit optimistic, mate.\nBut I like that you're showing some heart.
2	eX1	I've allocated about one full tick for all\nthe actual fighting. If you can't bring the\nheat like that, you've got no chance.
3	5	Sure thing, mate. We'll take\ncare of guarding Noah. You can\nhandle feeding the Flame Clock.
4	5	We've gotta top up the Commissary and\nsalvage corps too... The quicker you take\n'em down, the more you can fight, right?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110802.json
0	eX1	We've been eating watery beans for so long\nthat I can now finish mine in one tick.
1	3	With supplies being short, I guess food's been\ngetting thinner and thinner... Can see how\nyou'd lose the will to savor it...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110803.json
0	eX1	We're in charge of gathering supplies\nand materials and whatnot. You'd do\nwell not to get under our feet.
1	5	All right, no need to get ants in\nyour pants. So if we're around, it\ntakes you more "ticks", does it?
2	eX1	Sounds like you get it, pal.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110804.json
0	eX1	Kite's worryfests seem to be getting\na bit shorter, by a tick or two...
1	1	Yeah, I think so too. Seems to be\ndoing well with Zeon, too.
2	eX1	Trish was saying the same thing.\nKite's a worrywart.
3	1	In contrast, you seem pretty\nunflappable, Eastman.
4	eX1	Well... Kite's a guy who takes\nhis ticks doing stuff, that's all.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110805.json
0	eX1	Now we've got potatoes to eat, efficiency's\nhad a bit of a boost, I think.
1	eX1	As a result, I think we'll be able to\ntake out Moebius in say...five ticks.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110806.json
0	5	What's that you're shoveling down\nthere, Eastman?
1	eX1	(munch munch) This here is\nSpecial Spongy Ta-da-to Surprise.
2	eX1	We've got a speed-eating competition\ncoming up against Colony 4 pretty soon.
3	eX1	I can polish this off in two ticks.\nThat means I'm gonna win.
4	5	Oh, you poor mudder... Mind those\nSpongy Spuds don't stick in your throat.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110901.json
0	fX1	When Levnis repairs all done,\nHarala move on to adjustment of\npower frames for Zeon and Kurt...
1	1	Sounds like you're pretty busy right now!
2	fX1	Meh. Before and after of battle\nalways get bit higgledy-piggledy\naround here.
3	fX1	Anyhow. Harala like job, so being\nbusy not really so bad after all.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110902.json
0	fX1	Long time no peeping! Noah and\nRiku look both well, nicely fluffed.
1	fX1	Tidying workshop of Riku seemed like\nbig undertaking, since left in decidedly\nscruffy old state, so Harala leave it be.
2	fX1	But was full of useful bits and bobs to\ntinker with. Harala helped self to those.\nPlease to not have hard feelings!

evt/tlk/msg_tlk110903.json
0	fX1	Maintenance of Levnis not\nprogressing properly right now.\nBig headache of Harala.
1	fX1	But bringing of much materials and\nwhatnot big help! Harala cannot\nthank enough!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110904.json
0	fX1	Zeon and Kite both have somewhat\nbothersome personality.
1	fX1	If said clearly what was in own\nbrain-boxes, whole situation fixed\nmuch more properly!
2	3	You said it. Maybe they'll have a better\ntime of it now that they've started using\ntheir mouth-words.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110905.json
0	fX1	Sayings, do Eunie and friends\nknow Sadadan Bros.?
1	3	Yeah, we do! They're at Colony Tau\nright now. You know 'em too, Harala?
2	fX1	Actually Harala is sisterpon of brotherpons.\nHarala originally constitute fourth tier.\nUsed to stand on tippy-top!
3	fX1	But independent spirit of Harala turn to\nitchy feet. Wanted to go own way, plant\nfeet on ground wherever please, so did.
4	3	That's pretty cool, but...what's the deal\nwith stacking yourselves like that?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk110906.json
0	fX1	Noah heard of Millick Meadows?\nIt site of ultra-spooky cave...
1	fX1	Commander before Zeon sent out\nsurvey team there once, but not\none single 'pon return...
2	fX1	Maybe inside of cave is surprisingly\npleasant place, they just decide to\nlive there forever?

0	hX1	Losing Mwamba, the old commander\nand you, Noah, was a real punch in the\nguts for Colony 9.
1	hX1	We were all behind Zeon,\nof course. But everyone's morale\nwas on downward trajectory.
2	hX1	But now you guys are back, I think\nwe've got a chance to put the colony\nback to what it was before.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk111202.json
0	hX1	The Keves troops from other colonies see\nus as enemies now. Kite was good enough\nto bring me up to speed about that.
1	hX1	So there's nowhere for us to run now.\nBut...we aren't the only colony to have\nbroken ties with the Castle, are we?
2	hX1	Maybe if we joined forces with them,\nwe'd have a chance? We can't just go\ndown without a fight.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk111203.json
0	hX1	I've always thought that Zeon was\nwell suited to being a commander.
1	hX1	Seems like the bad vibes between him\nand Kite have gone away too. That's\nbound to make him more approachable.
2	hX1	I think a lot of that is thanks to\nKite's influence, too.
3	hX1	Yeah, all in all, I think they\nmake a pretty good team.

1	yV	You took good care of me too... The works.\nYou're a real big-hearted bunch.
2	1	Well... Once, someone helped me out too,\njust like this. And that person was a lot\nlike you. I couldn't just leave you be.
3	yV	Yeah? Well, I guess I owe some\ngratitude to whoever that was!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk111602.json
0	3	So how's life in the City?
1	yV	I'd say I've gotten used to it. Now I'm\nfeeling better, maybe it's time I started\nlending a hand with the salvaging.
2	3	That's a great idea!\nSomething tells me you'd be a\nreal sparking scavenging genius.
3	yV	What... Why do you say that? I wasn't\nthinking I'd do much actual salvaging.\nI was gonna help out as a guard, I meant.

2	yV	I promised Eilis a visit. So I gotta get\nall this stuff down pat soon as I can.
3	5	You better make sure you keep to that\npromise, Mwamba. Eilis is pretty scary\nwhen the rage descends.

0	5	So, how are you finding life\nin Colony 9, Garvel?
1	rX1	Well, I'm knee-deep in the mud every\nsnuffin' day. Not much of an upgrade\nfrom all that sand at Colony 4.
2	rX1	That and the lieutenant keeps stopping by\nto check up on me. Like I'm some kind of\ncriminal or something.

evt/tlk/msg_tlk113205.json
0	@X1	So they've finally found Moebius's base.\nThey've been pitching us against each\nother for long enough.
1	@X1	But no more. It's time to get in there\nand tear it down! There's a bright future\nwaiting right ahead of us!

0	WY1	I heard what happened to the\nConsul and the Flame Clock\nfrom Commander Teach...
1	WY1	I'm a little anxious about what we're\nsupposed to do from here on out.
2	WY1	It'll be OK as long as Commander Teach\nand Mio are here, though! I'll follow you\ntwo to the ends of the world!
3	2	...Thanks, Kyrie. We'll try and help\nyou all out as much as we can.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120102.json
0	WY1	Ooh, I can't wait to learn from you guys!
1	WY1	We just have to choose our instructor\nfrom the notice board?
2	6	Yup! You're gonna choose Mimi, right?
3	WY1	Yeah! How did you know that?!\nI-it's like you're psychic or something!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120103.json
0	WY1	Oh, Lanz! Thank you for going\nalong with Namuki!
1	5	Eh? Why the thanks? It's no problem.\nI'm good at pushing my body!
2	4	Despite his strangeness, you have quite a\nhigh opinion of him, don't you, Kyrie?
3	WY1	Yeah! Namuki is super brainy. He knows\nwaaaay more than I do.
4	WY1	I want to support him in whatever he\nwants to do. It's only fair after everything\nhe does to help me!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120104.json
0	WY1	Mio! I've already asked Zuno to make\nme a special training regime!
1	2	Proactive as ever, aren't you, Kyrie?
2	WY1	Nyehehe... Zuno's the strongest in my\nteam. I'm no match for him in the slightest.
3	WY1	But still... I wanna get stronger, like him,\nso that I can protect everyone!
4	WY1	I may rely on others now, but one day I'm\ngonna be a leader that can stand\nshoulder-to-shoulder with Foots and Zakir!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120105.json
0	WY1	Um, Mio...? Why did that Kevesi\nperson keep calling Teach "Oleg"?
1	2	Ah, that. Well...
2	WY1	The commander's been shouldering some\nheavy burdens all this time, hasn't he?
3	WY1	I don't really know what\nthey are, but either way...
4	WY1	I...I believe in the commander. I'll be\nhappy if I can lift some of the weight\noff his shoulders, even just a little bit.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120106.json
0	WY1	Hey, Eunie! I can't believe you went and\ngot a medical doctor just for Ysorra!
1	3	...Huh? Did you already know she\nwanted to be one?
2	WY1	Yeah! We've been besties since first term.\nWe never hide anything from each other!
3	WY1	Ysorra's super caring and considerate.\nI bet she'll make an amazing doctor!
4	6	Yeah. If you've been friends for that\nlong, then I'm sure you're right!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120107.json
0	WY1	...There aren't gonna be any more battles\nafter this one, are there, Mio?
1	2	...No. We're going to end this once and\nfor all. Take care of Colony Gamma, Kyrie.
2	WY1	Ah...! Of course! Just leave it to me!
3	WY1	I'm gonna protect this place to the bitter\nend! So make sure you make it back\nin one piece, OK, Mio?

0	XY1	By the way, where did you lot all go off to?\nSlacking off and loitering somewhere?\nOr just plain desertion?
1	6	No! Of course not!
2	4	Don't get so wound up, Sena. Foots here\nis just curious as to what happened to us...\nAm I correct?
3	XY1	So you're as sharp as they say, Taion.\nIt's a shame you're not so easy to provoke.
4	XY1	Anyway, it's fine, you don't need to tell me.\nI'm not that interested.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120202.json
0	XY1	Snuff's sake, you're ruthless...\nI can barely move now.
1	6	Heheh. You have a lot of training left to do\nif that's enough to make you give up.
2	XY1	Oh, shut up... I'll show you what I\ncan really do one of these days...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120203.json
0	XY1	What's so wrong with tryin' to get\nstronger to defeat our enemies?\nWe *are* in a war, you know.
1	XY1	Even the commander doesn't get that,\ndespite the harsh training he gives us.
2	XY1	I wish he'd teach us some real killer\nArts to put our enemies to sleep for good.
3	2	Foots...!
4	XY1	Meh, save me the lecture. Zakir's already\ngiven me enough to drive me round the\nbend. This colony's just full of softies.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120204.json
0	XY1	Hey, did Kyrie really team up with you\nto take down a Kevesi soldier?
1	3	You better believe it.\nKyrie's actually a top-notch fighter!
2	XY1	Huh. Wouldn't have thought it from\nthat softy. Maybe Commander Teach\nfinally hammered it home.
3	XY1	Heh, well ain't that something. Maybe\nshe'll finally start pulling her own weight.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120205.json
0	XY1	Hmm... Ysorra, a medical doctor?\nI mean, OK, sure. Why not?
1	3	Well, you're easily persuaded. I thought\nyou'd have your heart set against it.
2	XY1	Nagumo and I will take over the world, while\nshe becomes a doctor and supports us.\nSee? We can still be friends that way.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120206.json
0	XY1	I think there's been some kinda\nmisunderstanding. I don't really think\nNagumo is below me or anything.
1	XY1	I just think he's the second strongest\nin Gamma, compared to me.
2	XY1	So basically, we're the top two in the\nwhole colony. We're an unbeatable combo!
3	XY1	When I eventually become commander,\nhe's gonna be my right-hand man\nuntil the bitter end.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120207.json
0	XY1	Nice, I can feel my skin prickling... So this\nis how it feels before the final battle.
1	6	Don't even think about it.
2	XY1	Yeah, yeah, you don't have to tell me.\nI know we're not strong enough yet to\njoin you in this particular throwdown.
3	XY1	There's no point in sacrificing Gamma.\nWe'll just stay put and do what we can\nfrom here.
4	XY1	Anyway, I wish you luck. Go out\nthere and win like I know you can.

2	YY1	Your tenth?! Crap, you beat me!
3	YY1	I'm only on my fifth term...\nHow many more terms is ten...?\nSnuff it, I lost!!!

2	YY1	Whuh? What do you mean?\nAre you scared I'll get too strong?

3	5	You're bursting with energy, as usual...\nDon't you get tired being so hyped up?

1	YY1	...Wait a second, I think we might be\nthe most unbeatable team ever!
2	4	Maybe so. As long as you consider the\nlimits of your strength, of course.
3	YY1	Foots is so strong... Ysorra's incredible...\nAnd I'm! Super! VICIOUS!!! The three of\nus make an unstoppable duo, right?

evt/tlk/msg_tlk120401.json
0	ZY1	U-um, hey...! Thank you so\nmuch for helping Kyrie!
1	ZY1	She has no sense of direction at all...\nI don't know if she'll ever get better.\nShe's been that way forever...
2	6	Come to think of it, you're in the same\nterm as her, arentcha, Ysorra?
3	ZY1	Right. We're in different teams, though.\nShe still gets into as much danger as ever.\nIt causes us so much trouble!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120402.json
0	ZY1	So we can forget about the Flame Clock\nand we don't have to fight any more...
1	ZY1	Gamma's mostly staffed with new recruits\nright now, so I shudder to think what would\nhave happened if the fighting went on...
2	ZY1	B-but anyway! I'm so glad\nwe managed to avoid that!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120403.json
0	ZY1	Sena and Eunie... Your training really\nmade it clear to me that we still\nhave a long way to go yet...
1	ZY1	...Still, Foots and Nagumo are always\nfar too overconfident. It doesn't take\nmuch to get them all cocky...
2	ZY1	That attitude'll get them killed in an\ninstant if they rush into battle with it.\nIt makes me so uneasy...
3	3	Hang in there, Ysorra. You're the\nonly one who can stop those two!
4	ZY1	O-oh, stop, you're embarrassing me...\nHehe...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120404.json
0	ZY1	That Foots just disappears\ninto thin air at weird intervals.
1	ZY1	When he comes back in tatters and\nI ask him why he's so worn out,\nhe always dodges the question...
2	ZY1	He could compete with Kyrie, the amount\nof times he puts himself in danger...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120405.json
0	ZY1	I'm so glad Kyrie is safe, but...\nshe seems a little different somehow.
1	2	...You noticed?
2	ZY1	Yes. I don't know why, but she\nseems...braver? More inspiring?
3	6	I'm sure she'd love to hear you say that!
4	ZY1	No... I think I'll keep it to myself. I don't\nwant to enable her antics again...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120406.json
0	3	What's up, Ysorra? Are your\nmedical studies going OK?
1	ZY1	Yes! It's hard because there's lots to\nremember, but I'm making a lot more\nprogress than before, thanks to Maybach!
2	3	Nice, nice, that's the spirit...\nBy the way, did you tell your teammates\nabout wanting to be a military doctor?
3	ZY1	...No, not yet. But I can't keep\nhiding it forever, so...
4	ZY1	I'll tell them when I can... Despite how\nthey may seem, they mean a lot to me.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120407.json
0	ZY1	Maybach has been here teaching me\nall the time, so I've made tons of\nprogress in my studies!
1	ZY1	He also taught me lots of things\nabout Colony 4. To think a Kevesi\nperson would do that for me...
2	ZY1	...No, wait. It doesn't matter whether\nyou're from Keves or Agnus any more.\nThat's irrelevant now.
3	ZY1	If I become a military doctor, I really want\nto repay the favor to Maybach and\nhelp him out somehow!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120408.json
0	ZY1	Even in these desperate times,\nFoots and Nagumo just keep\npowering on like it's nothing.
1	2	Feeling the tension, Ysorra?
2	ZY1	Yeah, a little. To be honest, I never\nthought things would turn out this way.\nI'd never even considered it...
3	ZY1	But...I don't feel worried, or scared.\nI know you guys can do it. I know\nyou'll win the day for us!

0	aY1	Nopon are a mystery even to themselves.\nTheir outward appearance is of course\nclearly separate to us "non-pons"...
1	aY1	But they have similar powers of mental\nintrospection to us, as well as theory of\nmind...
2	aY1	Yes, they're a fascinating species... If I ever\nget the chance, researching Nopon subjects\nwouldn't be a bad idea at all!
3	aY1	But all that aside...where do you think\nthat Nopon Caravan came from?

0	aY1	My, my...! What an intriguing development\nthis has turned out to be!
1	5	Wow, you're in a great mood.\nDid something good happen?
2	aY1	I was observing everyone in the changing\nrooms, but they became oddly wary of\ntheir surroundings and stopped undressing.
3	aY1	This is unprecedented! I wonder\nwhat it means? What were they\nso concerned about? I must know!

0	5	Hey, Kyrie told me you were in line for\nbeing made captain, but you refused it.\nHow come?
1	aY1	Well, there's a very simple reason for that,\nLanz. My true interests lie in seeing how\nmuch growth Kyrie is capable of.
2	aY1	I suppose I just wanted to see\nwhat form a mercurial element\nlike her would take.
3	2	That's a very Namuki-style\nreason, for sure.
4	aY1	Plus Kyrie was the only one who\nseemed to truly appreciate my research.\nShe's a promising captain, for sure.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120505.json

1	aY1	This whole thing has exposed how little I\nknow, yet...I'm gladdened by the fact that\nthere are still things left to learn.
2	5	I like your gumption, Namuki. You make\nthe best out of what comes your way.
3	aY1	Thanks. I still have a lot to accomplish.\nI hope you'll be able to do what you have\nto do and get home safe, Lanz!

0	bY1	Learning Commander Teach's walking\ntechnique is supposed to let you traverse\ncertain treacherous slopes without slipping.
1	bY1	Even the perils of Dannagh Desert\nwould pose no problem...
2	6	Oh yeah? I think we just learned\nthat from him, so maybe a trip to\nthe desert's in order...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120602.json
0	1	...Were you close with Miclan?
1	bY1	I wouldn't call us "close"... He just kept\npoking his nose into my business.
2	bY1	He was someone even that shy girl Schoon\ncould talk to comfortably, though...\nYou know, a genuinely decent guy.
3	bY1	But he went and left us in the end...\nleaving his dear Schoon behind.
4	1	Ah...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120603.json
0	5	I wonder, have you lot ever been\nsubjected to Namuki's research, too?
1	bY1	...Sometimes, yes. He gives us\nregular physical exams.
2	bY1	He makes us run a hundred laps around\nthe colony, get in an ice bath, hang\nupside-down from our feet, stuff like that...
3	5	Can that even be called research?! I can't\nbelieve you go along with all that!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120604.json
0	2	Excuse me, Zuno. I have\na little favor to ask you...
1	bY1	...What is it?
2	2	If Kyrie ever needs your help with\nsomething, can you do your best to help\nher out? I know it's a big ask, but...
3	bY1	...Understood.
4	2	Thank you. She's lucky to have\nyou to support her, Zuno.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120605.json

2	bY1	...I'll try and do something about\nher habit of wandering, before her\nnext practice.
3	2	B-but don't do anything rash, will you?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk120606.json

1	1	...It's OK. We'll finish this before\nit comes down to that.
2	bY1	...I really admire you. You guys fight\nto protect this world. There's no way\nI could do that.
3	1	Zuno, I'd think there's...maybe\nsomeone you want to protect?

0	cY1	Commander Teach fluidly switches\nbetween offense and support as the\nbattle demands.
1	cY1	Bolstering his allies with offensive and\nhealing Arts while enfeebling his enemies...\nIt's like he's everywhere at once.
2	cY1	And that, in my eyes,\nis the height of mastery.

2	cY1	I sincerely hope you will use this loss as\nan opportunity to come to terms with your\nweaknesses and iron them out, Noah.
3	1	(sigh)... You're right. Would you help guide\nme, if that isn't too much to ask?

evt/tlk/msg_tlk120704.json
0	cY1	Commander Teach is a very thoughtful\ngentleman, unlike some who love to obsess\nover increasing the Flame Clock rank.
1	cY1	As you know, his real strengths lie in how\nhe calmly thinks about the larger context,\nand sees things for what they truly are.
2	cY1	Without a shadow of a doubt, he is the\nstandard to which all those who call\nthemselves commanders should aspire to.

2	cY1	...That's a low blow. I don't remember ever\nmaking any "snide remarks" about my\ncomrades. But I'll tell you one thing...
3	cY1	Kyrie is irreplaceable to me. It is precisely\nbecause she is so irreplaceable that I,\non occasion, can be hard on her.
4	cY1	Of course, I think of Foots in the same\nway. So don't go getting any ideas.

3	cY1	All of us in Colony Gamma swear to do\neverything we can so that Commander\nTeach can fight with a clear heart.

1	dY1	If we didn't raise our Flame Clock rank,\nwe'd be left to our own devices...or just\ncast aside.
2	dY1	Or perhaps he just placed his faith\nin Commander Teach. I guess we'll\nnever know now...

1	dY1	If you mean his utter admiration for your\ningenuity, then yeah, totally.
2	dY1	Your teaching really motivated him to\nimprove himself. Your forward thinking\nreally made an impression on him.

1	dY1	They've thrown themselves into their\ntraining, thanks to your encouragement.\nThey're even turning up to class more!

3	dY1	...If so, then I must say, he's very insightful.\nNo wonder Zakir respects him so much.

0	dY1	Zakir's always worried about Foots and\nKyrie, but they all seem pretty similar\nfrom where I'm standing.
1	4	Well, that's certainly an audacious opinion.\nAnd why do you think so?
2	dY1	All three of them try too hard, and they\nlet themselves get caught up in the short\nterm. Honestly? They're menaces.
3	dY1	But...recently they've been better about it.\nYou can feel that they're acting more like\ncaptains.

1	eY1	He said he'd stand by my side and keep\nme safe so I could play without worrying...

0	lY1	Just because we don't have to follow\nMoebius any more doesn't erase the\nthings Colony 0 has done.
1	lY1	For now we have to find a safe place\nto lay low. No. 7 should understand that...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk130102.json
0	lY1	As you'd expect of a large-scale prison, it\nhas the tools and facilities needed for\nself-sufficiency, and I'm very grateful for it.
1	lY1	Now, if we cut off contact with the outside\nworld, and aim to live off only what we\nneed, we should be able to live in safety.
2	3	Dunno if you really need to be *that*\nhardcore about it...

0	lY1	One of Wheelideeli's tricks is to make you\npay a "stocking fee" that adds up to more\nthan the original cost of the item he procures.
1	lY1	We shouldn't have relied on him. Worst\ncomes to worst, the prison will be claimed\nas collateral, rather than refurbished.
2	5	Shady little furball... Is it too late\nto do anything about it now?

2	lY1	...I don't really know why myself, but\nseriously, just don't pry into it for now.
3	6	...OK. I'll just keep close by\nher like usual.

0	lY1	No. 13 was what would be called\na commander in other colonies.\nShe was No. 7's predecessor.
1	lY1	She showed a little defiance towards the\nConsul, and sure, she could be scary at\ntimes, but she was a good, caring leader.
2	6	Caring, huh...?
3	lY1	I was hoping No. 13 would return\nto us, but...perhaps it's enough to\nknow that she's alive.

1	2	Bet you never thought you'd end up\nhaving a name yourself, huh?
2	mY1	...Right. It's a bizarre feeling, but I'm\nactually getting more used to being called\nIx now than No. 6.
3	4	You're all human, never doubt that.\nYou could say that feeling is that\nof your true self.
4	mY1	...You might be right. So that's\nwhy Segiri wanted names for everyone...

0	sZ1	Bolearis, acting commander?\nIt's a pretty ballsy move. But he's\ngot the passion for it, that's for sure.
1	sZ1	And I know the tactician squad will do\neverything they can to support him in the\nrole. Can't let him take all the credit.
2	3	Yeah? Well, thanks for that.\nMake sure he doesn't do anything\ntoo stupid, OK?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210207.json
0	sZ1	Jeremy's been sent to the\nguardhouse. He'll be locked away\nthere for a little while, I think.
1	sZ1	He's surely worthy of stiff punishment for\nwhat he did to you, but I can try to knock\nsome sense into him, if you let me.
2	2	That's kind of you...
3	sZ1	He's one of mine, so it should fall\nto me to set him back on the right path.\nThere's still a war on, after all.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210208.json
0	sZ1	Bolearis is actually doing pretty well as\nacting commander. Better than I thought\nhe would, anyway.
1	sZ1	In fact, I don't see why he couldn't just\ndrop the "acting" part and just accept the\ntitle "commander". But he won't have it.
2	3	Yeah, right? Well, that's Bolearis for you.\nHe's way more single-minded and stubborn\nthan he looks.
3	sZ1	I don't know if it's humility, or a hard\nhead... But if Ethel could see him now,\nI think she'd get a good laugh out of it.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210301.json
0	tZ1	Doesn't matter what Maxie says.\nYou Agnian scum are still the enemy,\nfar as I'm concerned.
1	tZ1	Don't be getting any funny ideas\nwhile you're here, OK? Or else!
2	6	Mimi... Uhm...\nShould we move along here, maybe...?
3	2	...Yes. All right
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210302.json
0	tZ1	Word of the Flame Clock getting\nsmashed has spread to the other\ncolonies now, I'm sure.
1	tZ1	All your enemies will be tightening security\ntoo, thanks to that little stunt. You've only\ngot yourselves to blame here.
2	3	Hey, lay off us already!\nAfter everything we've done for you-
3	4	Eunie... Don't let him rile you up.\nThat's exactly what he wants.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210303.json
0	tZ1	Ugh... Still alive, are you?\nAnd you look well. Even worse.
1	tZ1	Spark it... Why's everyone around here\nsuch a snuffin' goodie two-shoes?
2	tZ1	It can't end like this, it just can't...!
3	2	...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210304.json
0	2	Uhm...
1	tZ1	...What? You think we got something\nto talk about? I got nothing.
2	2	...Right. Very well.
3	tZ1	The time to talk is over. Just get out there\nand make an end of it. All this fighting's\ntaken away so much from us already...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210401.json
0	uZ1	So who, ultimately, is our true enemy?\nIs it Agnus, or the Consuls?
1	uZ1	Or...could it be you...? Nah, I didn't mean it.\nBut I don't think any of us can know for sure.\nThe plot is thickening by the minute...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210402.json
0	uZ1	If you're going to the Cadensia region,\nwhere the Great Sword is, then I'd advise\nyou to go directly through Nih'l Valley.
1	uZ1	But, beware...\nIf you take a right turn, you'll find\nyourself in Colony Iota's domain.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210403.json
0	uZ1	Hey, by the way... Have you met\nYorde from the tactician squad yet?
1	uZ1	Yorde and I are kind of a unit.\nSure, she's a little uptight sometimes,\nbut I really depend on her for a lot.
2	uZ1	Anyway if you see her, you should\nsay hi. It'll be good for us all to get\nto know each other, right?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210404.json
0	uZ1	"Monster" is only a single word, but it\nhides a true diversity. Some you only see\nat night, others only in certain weather...
1	uZ1	Maybe this sounds like trivia to you now,\nbut in some situations, it could mean the\ndifference between life and death.
2	4	Indeed...\n"To know your enemy is to conquer him."\nA maxim I have ever lived by.
3	uZ1	I couldn't agree more. You can't go\nwrong with a good bit of intel.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210405.json
0	uZ1	Hey. Laszlo told me about Jeremy.
1	uZ1	I can't forgive him for hurting Yorde\nlike that. To be honest, I feel like I'd need\nto give him a good punch to settle it.
2	uZ1	But when I think about how isolated and\ndriven into a corner he was...
3	uZ1	...I realize that it would have been much\nbetter if we'd have talked with him and\nthrashed it out within the tactician squad.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210406.json
0	uZ1	Things seem really stirred up\nall of a sudden... Can this really\nbe the end of the war...?
1	uZ1	Ah, can't let weak doubts like that\nin now. Got to keep the pressure up,\nright to the very end!
2	3	Yeah, just gotta hold out\na little longer. We can do it...\nWe can stamp this war out!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210501.json
0	vZ1	Ethel's an open-hearted person...\nShe didn't hesitate to welcome Agnus\ninto the fold...
1	vZ1	It's not quite so easy for rank and file\nlike us though... Getting used to it will\ntake a little time, I think.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210502.json
0	vZ1	So, you guys were originally affiliated with\nColony 9 and Colony Gamma, is that right?
1	vZ1	It must have caused quite a stir when\nword got out that they produced rebels...\nDo you think they're OK?
2	4	Somehow I highly doubt that.\nI wish we could go and check...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210503.json
0	vZ1	Jeremy's got a real nasty attitude, for sure.\nBut you have to bear in mind that Agnus\nkilled his friends.
1	vZ1	Emotion often gets ahead of logic.\nSo you might need to tread carefully\naround him, in case he gets any ideas.
2	5	How about I sock him one first?\nThat'd put him in his place.
3	4	Lanz... Are you for real...?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210504.json
0	vZ1	Since the incident, a lot of people\nin the colony are starting to condemn\nJeremy for what he did.
1	vZ1	It's understandable, but it ultimately\nwon't solve anything to drive him to\nthe edge like that.
2	1	It's all one big mess at the moment,\nisn't it? Especially given Jeremy's\nmotives...
3	vZ1	Yeah... I mean, I just want to find\na peaceful resolution to it all...as\na member of the tactician squad.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210505.json
0	vZ1	Fla'ran's pretty tough, all right.
1	vZ1	She holds firm to her fighting spirit,\neven in the face of Origin. And it's so\nvastly bigger than a Ferronis, too...
2	vZ1	All I can do is support her so that she\ndoesn't wipe herself out. That's what I've\nalways done... That's what I'll always do.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210601.json
0	wZ1	Have friends sampled delight of yummy\nMixed-Veg Torpedo Wrap? Pinnacle of\ncuisine of Dirt. Recommend much!
1	6	Huh, I never knew...\nThose were pretty tasty, right, Mimi?
2	2	We'll have to tell Manana about this.\nI'm sure it'll inspire her cooking too.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210602.json
0	wZ1	Mikoko send many yummy\ningredients to here. Time for new\nphase of culinary experiments!
1	wZ1	Ambition of Kukucha is basically\nstuff tummies of friends with yummy\nfood until fill with happiness.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210603.json
0	wZ1	Kukucha hope Laszlo OK.\nWas looking much down in\ndumps recently.
1	wZ1	Kukucha suppose cause is empty\ntummy of Laszlo. Will supply food\nfreely to fill up and fix!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210604.json
0	wZ1	Everyone looking deep in doldrums.\nPlease fill up on cuisine of Kukucha\nand carry on boldly fighting!
1	5	Yeah, I won't stand in the way of that.\nGotta fill an empty tum somehow!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210605.json
0	wZ1	Meh...? Wh-where did friend\nfind that item of cookware...?
1	9	Meh meh! Kukucha notice special\ncookware of Manana? Special custom\npot made by certain legendary cheffypon.
2	wZ1	Legendary cheffypon...?!\nKukucha come to rolling boil of envy...\nOK if Kukucha use little tiniest bit?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210701.json
0	xZ1	I hope you'll stop by the canteen\nagain. Anyone with an empty stomach\ngets a warm welcome here.
1	2	Thanks! We love your cooking, too!
2	xZ1	Hehe... No, c'mon, it's not all that. But\nseriously, I'll even slip you a few freebies on\nthe house if I've got enough ingredients in.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210702.json
0	xZ1	Kukucha's a bit of a slowpoke at times,\nbut her cooking ability is first rate among\nall of Keves. Silver-rank cuisine, I'd say!
1	xZ1	Yeah, that little Nopon's onto something.\nThe most paltry, nasty ingredients are\ntransformed into incredible dishes!
2	xZ1	If it wasn't for her manning the kitchen,\nwe'd be passing the days eating nothing\nbut bland rations. Trash!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210703.json
0	xZ1	Some of the troops say that people like me\nserving in the catering corps are cowards,\nand we couldn't hack it at the front.
1	xZ1	I always say to them, how much fighting\nare you gonna get done on an empty\nstomach? I've got a point, right?
2	xZ1	Every single person here at the colony is\na fighter, on their own battlefield. Ah, I'm\nstarting to sound like Maxie now...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210704.json
0	xZ1	It's going to take a whole lot more\nthan an apology to make amends for\nwhat Jeremy did.
1	xZ1	He's going to get a suitable punishment\nfor this. I don't think he's got a leg to\nstand on in Colony 4 either.
2	xZ1	Even so... I still believe in him.\nIf I didn't, he'd be on his own\nright now, that's for sure.
3	xZ1	Mercutio would have done\nthe same, I think. That's what\nfriends do, right?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210705.json
0	xZ1	...The news has reached us. Apparently Keves\naren't the only ones with a fake Queen.\nThe monarch of Agnus is a fake too, right?
1	xZ1	Finding out that really made me think,\ny'know? Like, why is it that we've all been\nfighting each other for so long?
2	xZ1	Ah, I'm sorry... That's probably a question\nfor the future. It doesn't matter right now.
3	xZ1	I already decided what I was fighting\nfor a while back. For Colony 4, and\nfor you guys.

0	yZ1	The Flame Clock might be gone,\nbut we still have the mark left on\nour bodies.
1	yZ1	I don't have anything really solid to base\nthis on, but I think life energy and our time\nhere in the flesh are distinct.
2	yZ1	But...never mind that right now. What I\nam sure of, is that we owe you so much\nthanks, for this life without constant war.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210802.json
0	yZ1	Thanks to those medical supplies\nyou got for us, it looks like we'll be\nable to ride out this rough spot.

0	yZ1	Finally, we're getting a steady supply\nof the things we need for treatment.\nWe'll be good for the foreseeable future.
1	yZ1	Did you lot help us out again?\nI heard from Solon that you did.
2	1	Really, it was nothing.\nWe just did what Solon asked us to.
3	yZ1	I don't think I can offer you enough thanks\nand admiration for what you've done. I'm\nlaying it on thick here, but I really mean it.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210804.json
0	yZ1	I don't have too much to complain about\nwith Maybach as an assistant, except for\nhis fixation on procedures and manuals.
1	yZ1	I'd prefer it if he was just a bit\nmore flexible in his thinking. I wonder\nif there's a way to fix that...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210805.json
0	yZ1	I'd known Ethel for a long time, since before\nthey started calling her "Silvercoat".
1	yZ1	I really thought that I knew her better than\nanyone else, but it looks like I've been\nproven entirely wrong on that count.
2	yZ1	In the end, I see it was Bolearis who\nshe had the most influence on...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210806.json
0	yZ1	If it turns into a large scale battle,\nthere's sure to be many casualties.\nThe reality is, those can't be avoided.
1	yZ1	We medics have a duty to keep battling\nthrough until the whole of that reality has\nplayed out. So, be careful out there.
2	1	Thank you, Oleshandra. I hope you'll\nremember to take care of yourself, too.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210901.json
0	zZ1	Smashing a Flame Clock is basically\na signal to the Castle that you're defying\nthem, right?
1	zZ1	They already knocked us down to\nDirt rank. I shudder to think what the\nconsequences might be this time...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210902.json
0	zZ1	Yeah, I'm sure that the situation called for\nit, but right now is a terrible time for the\ncommander to be heading to the Castle.
1	zZ1	Well...I'm sure it'll work out, somehow.\nHer Majesty is a great and generous\nally to us.
2	3	Best not to think about it too much,\nyeah? This is the kind of thing Ethel's\ngot in the bag.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210903.json
0	zZ1	Sandstorms out in the wilderness are\ncausing a lot of respiratory problems\namong troops at the moment.
1	zZ1	Our current equipment isn't up to\nthe task. We don't even have protective\nmasks. I don't know how to fix this...
2	zZ1	Hmm... I'll speak with Oleshandra later,\nsee if she can give some guidance on that.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210904.json
0	zZ1	We're seeing fewer casualties now than\nwe did at the beginning. The atmosphere\nin the colony's generally improved, too.
1	zZ1	If Ethel could see how things are now...\nAh... No... Sorry, just forget I said that,\nwill you?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210905.json
0	zZ1	I was worried at first, but it's really not\nas different here as I thought it'd be.\nThat's put me at ease.
1	zZ1	In fact, it barely feels any different at all...\nPeople here, they're just like us.
2	zZ1	Seems like at the end of the day, we'd been\nkilling our fellow humans, and they killed us.\n...My time here has driven the point home.
3	zZ1	It was tough... I hope Colony Gamma\ncan be spared some of those difficult\nfeelings somehow.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk210906.json
0	zZ1	The situation being what it is, I'd made\nup my mind to go back to Colony 4.
1	zZ1	But then Oleshandra hit me up and asked\nme if I'd stay at Colony Gamma and keep\nassisting them. To be honest, it was a relief.
2	6	Really?
3	zZ1	Yeah. I've really gotten to know the people\nhere at Gamma. There's still a lot more\nthey can learn from me too, I think!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk211001.json
0	@Z1	Quite a few of the troops want you\nto be expelled from the colony.
1	@Z1	But...I don't think they're driven by\nmalice. It's just that fear and confusion\nhas clouded their judgment.
2	@Z1	You should give them a fair hearing, or see if\nyou can lend a hand somehow. Maybe you'll\nwin their hearts and minds that way?
3	@Z1	If you give them a reason to fix their\nmisunderstandings, I'm sure they'll make\nthe effort.
4	2	Thanks, Solon. We'll give that some\nserious thought.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk211002.json
0	@Z1	Some Ferronis types have a fabricator\ninstalled that manufactures the materials\nneeded for self-sufficiency, I heard.
1	@Z1	Word is, the tactician squad found wrecks\nof Ferronises like that while they were\nscouting Dannagh Desert and Ribbi Flats.
2	@Z1	We can't remove the fabricators from them,\nunfortunately. They're hardwired straight\ninto the chassis. It's a real shame.
3	@Z1	On the other hand, we can still use\nthe fabricators in situ... So it's not\na total washout.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk211003.json
0	@Z1	It was a real shame to lose Ethel. I don't\nthink she would have ever settled things\nwith Cammuravi any other way, though.
1	@Z1	But just as she was prepared to accept\nthat conclusion, there are things that\ncame with it that we need to accept, too.
2	@Z1	I mean, the commander may be gone now,\nbut that doesn't mean the colony will stop\nin its tracks. That's acceptance, right there.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk211004.json
0	@Z1	When the Flame Clock was smashed, our\nwhole world changed, and in a big way.
1	@Z1	It sounds strange to say, but the fact\nthat we all got to witness this revolution\nwas a great honor, I think.
2	@Z1	And by way of returning that honor, I and\neveryone here at Colony 4 will offer up all\nour strength in the battle that you face.
3	4	We couldn't be more reassured.\nNaturally, we'll do our best to live up\nto everyone's expectations.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk211101.json
0	_Z1	The road to Ribbi Flats looks to be\nblocked. It'll have been that landslip\nfrom when the Ferronis passed through.
1	_Z1	We're using a bit of Levnis power to clear\nit all up at the moment. You'll be informed\nas soon as we're done.
2	1	Thanks, we much appreciate it.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk211102.json
0	_Z1	Ribbi Flats is vast. If you're making your\nway to Swordmarch, then you should\nmake use of Elsie's Spout as a landmark.
1	6	Elsie's Spout, you say! OK, I got it!
2	_Z1	Ah... Something else! You'd be well\nadvised to steer clear of Dannagh Desert.\nIt's a very dangerous place.
3	2	A desert, huh...? Well, I don't think I'd\nwant to go there anyway, dangerous\nor not...

2	_Z1	I, uh... I think I might respect him\nso much, the respect goes full\ncircle and turns to fear...
3	2	Th-that's a really complex feeling\nyou're experiencing there...

2	Xa1	Nah, come on, you're putting words in my\nmouth there. I mean you're doing good.\nShowing a bit of solid grit. I respect that.

2	ha1	Yeah, that happened once.\nI remember it well.
3	ha1	Valdi and the Nopon picked up a bunch of\nLevnises, modded them, and promptly lost\ncontrol. The machines went berserk on Iota...

0	la1	So Widgewidge was worried he\nwas going to be replaced, huh?
1	la1	Naturally, the commander let those\nNopon off the hook without a second\nthought. He's just too soft sometimes!
2	la1	I'm already dreading what crazy idea\nhe'll get into his head next...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk220505.json
0	la1	I thought the commander was paying so\nmuch attention to the Levnises because\nhe was just a Levnis nut.
1	la1	But now it's hit home that what he was\nreally concerned about was his friends...\nThat's just the kind of guy he is...
2	la1	I've come to think of Levnis maintenance\nlike that too. Looking after Levnises is the\nsame as protecting your friends!

evt/tlk/msg_tlk220601.json
0	ma1	I've got a kind of love-hate relationship\nwith Michel, head of the fourth Levnis\nteam.
1	ma1	He waltzes into battle like an absolute\nidiot, and through some miracle or other\nalways makes it back in one piece.
2	ma1	If it wasn't for Colony 30's sterling Levnis\ntech, he'd have copped it long ago!

1	ma1	If they'd have continued the war,\nColony 30's battle performance\nwould've been off the charts!
2	ma1	But no, the commander did this precisely\nbecause we've stopped fighting, didn't he?\nJust forget what I said, OK?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk220604.json
0	ma1	I wanted to charge right in with a Levnis\nin the battle against Moebius...but the\ncommander has other ideas.
1	ma1	He reckons that if Dorrick is there,\nthere's no need for us to be fighting\nand getting injured.
2	ma1	So that's his plan: go into battle on\nhis own. That doesn't sit well with me.\nMaybe I can talk it over with him...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk220701.json

2	1	That's right.
3	na1	I suppose I'd better be careful when I\nleave the colony then... I'm not really\na match for that level of aggression.

2	oa1	Well, yeah, I mean, if it wasn't for Yuzet, I\ndon't think Colony 30 would even be here.
3	oa1	Until it's time for his Homecoming,\nI'm going to look out for him with all\nthe power I have at my disposal.
4	2	That's uh...dedication.

1	oa1	When I asked why he was going traveling,\nhe said he just wanted to see the sights.\nA tenth-termer's wont, I guess.
2	oa1	So...I gave him a little something...\nSomething I don't think he'd seen before.\nHe looked over the moon.
3	oa1	Maybe I didn't see it right, but I think\nI even glimpsed a few teardrops?\nAll that over a tiny little thing.
4	oa1	I wonder what I stirred up in him\nto make him react like that...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk220806.json

0	va1	So yeah, the commander had this teacher\nwith mad skills. That "Masterpon" guy he\nkeeps bangin' on about?
1	va1	But Masterpon went on some journey\nor other, and they ain't heard a peep\nfrom him since. Years, it's been.
2	va1	I hear he's something else with a hammer.\nHope I get to see that for meself sometime!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk221503.json
0	va1	Our colony ain't half lucky. This one\ntime, we came up against a Silver rank.\nAnd we trounced the mudders!
1	va1	Colony Iota, they were called.\nI think we were Copper rank\nback then, or maybe Iron...
2	va1	Bit after that, they got high-rank Levnises,\nso the timing was actually perfect for us.\nWe totally would've lost against those!
3	va1	But hey, whatever. I guarantee you our\nesteemed commander don't remember\na thing about it!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk221504.json
0	va1	Whoa, Sequoia! That girl needs\nto ease off. She's so into her work,\nshe's making me look bad!
1	va1	So this is how she got the Collectopaedia\ndoin' the rounds... Little out of my comfort\nzone though, as a mechanic.
2	va1	That's not to say I'm not interested,\n'cause I am! I'm actually hoping she could\nteach me a bunch. Fingers crossed!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk221505.json
0	va1	So...Aionios is a pretty messed-up place\nright now, huh. Still, I reckon I could make\nmeself useful, learn something around here.
1	va1	We're all working till we're blue in the\nface. Our guys are crazy good at snatching\nvictory from the jaws of defeat!
2	va1	And then, when the battle's won,\nwe're gonna need people who can\nthink of a plan and follow through.
3	va1	Not to blow me own trumpet,\nbut I think I could fill them boots!
4	va1	Like, I guess...I wanna get the Colony 30\npeeps to do more of what they like?\n'Cause if they're happy, I'm happy!

2	_a1	Actually, considering the plan's level of\nsecrecy, I thought it had made quite a stir.\nBut Dame Alex doesn't roll like that.
3	_a1	It doesn't matter what kind of set-to\nshe sees - she just tells us to stick to\nour routines.

0	Wb1	Do you know what the nature of\nOuroboros is? What they mean\nfor us?
1	6	They're like...enemies of the world, right?
2	Wb1	Consuls see it that way. But really, they're\na kind of mighty, yet inexplicable entity\nthat exists beyond the realm of rules.
3	Wb1	It's the very existence of such special\nbeings that allows rules to be questioned.
4	Wb1	And, for that, I'm thankful.\nThat's all I wanted to get across.

evt/tlk/msg_tlk230303.json
0	Wb1	Collectopaedia Cards have\na built-in feature that marks the\nlocation of the issuer.
1	Wb1	It was smart of Sif to flip that on its head,\nbut there's still one person who's not so\nkeen on the whole thing.
2	6	Yeah? Someone else?
3	Wb1	That would be Fili. He actively avoids\naccessing the system because it knows\nyour location.
4	Wb1	I actually have no idea what he's doing\nwith himself right now. He hasn't been in\ncontact even once. It's driving me crazy.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk230304.json
0	Wb1	The day Colony 30 defeated us was an\nutter disaster, and that's putting it lightly.
1	Wb1	Fili and I did what we could to console\nDame Alex throughout the night. We never\ndreamed there'd be a peaceful resolution.
2	Wb1	And yet here we are. Colony 30 seems\nto defy prediction time and time again.

0	Wb1	Honestly, this was not the development\nI was expecting.
1	Wb1	I thought it'd be a source of frustration,\nbut I actually feel really good about it all.\nI don't quite get it.
2	1	It's all right sometimes though, right?\nTo enjoy something, even if you can't\nquite explain it to yourself.
3	Wb1	Fili said something like that to me once...\nBut it didn't quite sink in, back then.
4	Wb1	But now...I think I'd like to talk it over\nwith him, one more time...

1	Yb1	They're the pillars of Colony Iota, but\nit won't be long before they're gone.\nGone for good...
2	Yb1	So I've been thinking about how we\ncould set focus on the future of the colony.\nHow we might groom new leadership.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk230502.json
0	Yb1	Colony Iota puts a lot of energy\ninto food and medical care.
1	Yb1	It was one of Dame Alex's initiatives.\nVery sensible, as staying fit and healthy\nis vital for keeping up morale...

0	Yb1	Hey, listen up! Dame Alex's real birthday\nwas so closely guarded, not even the\ncaptains knew how old she was.
1	Yb1	Only, Captain Chelle and Rhyza were\njust pretending not to know...
2	Yb1	Looks like they just wanted to see the fuss\nthat Dame Alex got into when she found\nout they knew. That's just horrible, right?
3	Yb1	Horrible indeed!\nBecause I wanted to see it too!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk230505.json
0	Yb1	I'm really glad Dame Alex's circle\nof friends is expanding. They seem\nlike a pretty quirky bunch, though...
1	Yb1	I mean, a Levnis called "Cyberchum"...?\nA Garaffa would make for a better\nconversation partner if you ask me...
2	Yb1	Anyway, Salazar said she wanted to\nmake its acquaintance, so I've gone and\nstationed it next to the research lab.
3	Yb1	Hmmm...
4	Yb1	Maybe I should put it inside.\n'Cause friends don't subject\nfriends to the elements...right?

0	Zb1	Dame Alex is not merely resourceful;\nshe is also a pugilistic precisian.
1	Zb1	To wit, she possesses an attack power\nbeyond the ken of ordinary footsoldiers.
2	Zb1	Sadly, her power is as fleeting as it is\nfierce, for falling upon the battlefield even\nonce will diminish its potency.
3	Zb1	She fights to provide support to her four\ncaptains, wielding Arts with which she\nweaves between enemy attacks.
4	6	That's cool. We should probably try\nsomething along those lines too, huh!

0	Zb1	Once, to Silver rank we clawed our way.\nBut the colony yet develops! All remains\nin flux!

2	Zb1	The rebirth of life itself, one might say,\nreformed into something sweet and\nwinsome...!

1	Zb1	I'd time to contemplate their actions\ndeeply as we were pounded by the\nraging torrent of Elsie's Spout...
2	3	Pounded by a waterfall...?\nWith Rhyza...?
3	Zb1	No common will could resolve to cut oneself\nto the quick like that for one's friends. My\nadmiration for them knows no bounds!

2	Zb1	Verily! Those are the names of the fiercest\nand most formidable fiends that roam with\nimpunity somewhere within our world.
3	Zb1	If one were to fell them, they'd surely be\nknown as the most formidable of Aionios!\nPerhaps you'll take the challenge!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk230701.json
0	ab1	Maybe you already know about it, but the\nfirst time Dame Alex's battle gambit came\ntogether was against you guys.
1	ab1	It was at her order that we lured\nOuroboros so that they'd approach\nfrom the south.
2	5	From the south...? How's that?
3	4	...For ease of attack. Striking north of the\nMechonis Hand is typical. But exiting via\nthe Eagus Wilderness forms a pincer.
4	ab1	Yep. Our plan to lure you to this deceptive\nterrain yielded pretty good results.\nDame Alex picked it out, of course.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk230702.json

1	ab1	We're the same term, so I hate to be\noutdone by him, but I'm probably not\neven a blip on his radar.
2	ab1	It was the same deal with this resupply\nthat we just took care of. I must be the\nonly one with any rivalry in mind.
3	ab1	I mean, what's the point in me looking at\nit like that? There's no reason for it, so\nwhy am I so desperate not to be outdone?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk230703.json
0	ab1	So Dame Alex was in her sixth term?\nOnly one below me...? No way!
1	6	Yeah, I was really surprised about it too!\nYou'd never guess from looking at her.
2	ab1	It's not just that... To get skills like she has\ntakes something more than regular effort.
3	ab1	I just wonder how much of that\nburden she shouldered by herself...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk230704.json
0	ab1	Colonies get destroyed once they\nreach Gold rank...? I can't believe it...
1	2	I'm afraid it's true.\nMortifying, isn't it?
2	ab1	And we were already Silver!\nOne wrong move and we would've\nsuffered the same fate...
3	ab1	It's a spine-chilling thought, all right.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk230705.json
0	ab1	H-hey, listen to me for a moment...\nThorbin just invited me along to join in\nwith his "secret training".
1	3	Huh? Like, his own secret\ntraining regime? For real?
2	ab1	Yeah, when I asked him what the secret\nto his strength was, he said if I really\nwant to know, we could do it together...
3	ab1	He said we'll be doing the training at\nElsie's Spout, and to come in clothes\nthat we don't mind getting wet.
4	ab1	I'm just feeling a little bit weird about the\nwhole thing. Do you think I'm overthinking\nit maybe?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk230801.json
0	bb1	His motivation and drive might be a bit\nlacking at the moment, but Fili used to be\na really decent captain.
1	bb1	I was made up to get on his squad.\nWe all want a leader who's strong,\nsmart, and you can look up to.
2	bb1	So you can understand why I get a bit\nannoyed when you see the status quo.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk230802.json
0	bb1	(sigh)
1	2	Hey, why the long face?\nIs everything all right?
2	bb1	Ah, I'm sorry. It's just that standing in\nfor the captain all of a sudden's been\na touch overwhelming...
3	bb1	Fili looked like he was doing sloppy work,\nbut all this stuff took some doing. Hard to\nrealize till the shoe's on the other foot...
4	bb1	I'm just annoyed that he never really\nshowed us his true colors...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk230803.json
0	bb1	The other colonies might not take to\ntroops like Salazar so kindly, I think.
1	bb1	She has some really great ideas, though.\nShe was the one that dug the underground\nchannels for our drinking water.
2	bb1	Thanks to Dame Alex recognizing her\nspecial way of "fighting", she's now\nallowed to immerse herself in her research.
3	bb1	Sure, Salazar can be a difficult person,\nbut I'm sure she holds Dame Alex in great\nesteem.

2	bb1	It's an era of intra-colony cooperation,\nbut also one where people decide for\nthemselves what's right.
3	2	That's right... Now, people pick out\ntheir own way of life. Just like Fili did...

2	db1	This marriage thing sounds like a\nnice idea... Think I could manage?
3	2	You want to get married?!\nUhm, who did you have in mind?
4	db1	Why, that would be Shinoh! I like her more\nthan anyone else, and I respect her. That's\nthe kind of person you should marry, no?

1	6	Huh...? H-how did you know?
2	ib1	It was the Collectopaedia Cards! I checked\nout your history, and saw a lot of requests\nto do with muscle training and stuff.
3	5	What, it even logs stuff like that?!\nTalk about an invasion of privacy...
4	ib1	Heh... Intelligence is the foundation of war,\nafter all. You get what the big deal is with\nCollectopaedia Cards now?

1	ib1	Except this time, I heard Sequoia\nwas the one who pushed for me.
2	ib1	She won't come up and tell it to you\ndirectly, but she likes showering people\nwith praise from afar.
3	ib1	That's just the sort of person she is.\nShe can be a bit stern sometimes, sure,\nbut I actually really respect her!

0	ib1	Dame Alex has such dignity... Hard to\nbelieve she's only in her sixth term.
1	3	Yeah, she's just got this sort of leaderly\nvibe, right? So careful and deliberate...
2	ib1	Right! I think she's really quite careful\nabout the sort of image she projects to\nothers, you know?
3	ib1	And according to Cozalie, she's\namazing with cosmetics, too!
4	ib1	Someday I'll have to ask\nDame Alex for some secret tips!

1	ib1	It's as if the winds of change are blowing,\nmore fiercely than ever...
2	ib1	...At least, that's what Chelle was\nsaying, anyhow. She sounded so\nhappy about it, too.
3	ib1	Declaring how glad she was for her\nown life... That's how I want to live,\ntoo - being thankful that I'm here.

0	6	Collectopaedia Cards are\nreally something now, huh?
1	ib1	They are! The whole way they're used\nhas changed... Or maybe it's just that\nthese are complex times...?
2	ib1	We've been hearing that relations\nin the community are a lot smoother\non the whole too.
3	ib1	Some people are already calling it\nthe "Collectopaedia revolution".\nSounds fitting, don't you think?

1	yb1	Please to tell Sherolo secret of such walk.
2	6	The most important thing is probably to\nthink of your legs as pointy sticks, sticking\ninto the ground.
3	yb1	What? But legs of Sherolo not long\nenough to be sticks, pointy or no...!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk240203.json
0	yb1	Have friends ever seen Ultimate Hammer?
1	yb1	Sherolo has never seen. Only seven in\nwhole of world. Very precious, precious\nand special hammer.

1	5	Uhm...yeah, maybe.
2	zb1	In times of hard, friends should remember\nfruit of training. That, and do shopping.
3	5	Training, eh? That makes sense.\nNot sure about the shopping, though.

2	_b1	Not unusual for Nopon to be dazzled by\nlust for ore, then fall off edge of cliff.\nTotutu hear many such tales.
3	6	Yeah? Well, I think that's the kind of\ndanger we can probably handle.

evt/tlk/msg_tlk310102.json
0	5	You're looking busy.
1	nc1	The commander was good enough to\ntell us about the work we have ahead\nof us. Gotta do what we've gotta do!
2	3	Hey, it's good to look to the future!
3	nc1	Things are really looking up now we have\nAuto-Levs and resources from the tunnels.

1	4	Correct. We adjudged that it\nwould be for the best.
2	nc1	Sheesh... Well, run it by us next time.\nWe're a little more rigid in our rules and\nregulations around here, you know.
3	nc1	It's by following the rules that we build\nsome solidarity in the colony, yeah?
4	nc1	Koji's as easily lead as he is enthusiastic.\nI'd prefer it if you didn't take it upon\nyourself to get him worked up like that.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310105.json
0	nc1	You guys... You really showed us up.
1	1	Hey... It's not like that.
2	nc1	The Flame Clock is gone. But we were still\ntrying to live the old way, until now.

3	oc1	Just, let me know if there's anything\nyou need. That's really all I wanted to\nget across.
4	2	That's much appreciated. But make\nsure you look out for yourself first, OK?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310301.json
0	pc1	Things got a whole lot better since\nwe rid ourselves of the Flame Clock\nand all the conflict that went with it.
1	6	Yeah, I figured it'd be an improvement.
2	pc1	I guess I can't really share it with everyone,\nbut I'm actually happy with how things\nhave turned out.

1	1	Yes. I think so.
2	pc1	Really? OK...
3	pc1	There were some people who said\nthat we could do without it. But I wasn't\nreally sure myself.
4	pc1	Well, I guess I have to just do what\nI can. Not that I can do much else...

1	5	Yeah, 'course. How's it working out?\nIs it any use?

1	6	Hey, I think everyone was busting a gut\nfor this. All we did was lend a hand.
2	pc1	In any case...thanks. I hope I can try\nto repay the favor someday, too.
3	pc1	Fighting isn't exactly my strong suit,\nbut call me up if you're ever in a tight\nspot, OK?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310401.json
0	4	Colony Lambda still seems to be\nin a considerable flurry.
1	qc1	True enough. But with Isurd as\ncommander, we're not too worried.
2	qc1	Lambda's a lot stronger now, thanks to\nthe commander. And I'm sure it'll grow\nstronger still.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310402.json
0	qc1	The commander seems to be constantly\nrushed off his feet these days.
1	5	Guess it comes with the territory.\nAin't easy keeping a whole colony\nin check.
2	qc1	I mean, I get it, there are heaps of\nproblems in Colony Lambda right\nnow. Much more than before.
3	qc1	We need to do what we can to help, too.\nWith the supply teams, cooking, sanitation...\nwhatever needs to be done.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310403.json
0	qc1	Colony 5 reached Gold rank, right...?
1	3	Yeah, and it didn't mean a snuffing thing.\nWe've just been dancing around in the\npalm of those mudders' hand...
2	qc1	We'd been aiming for Gold\nall this time...
3	qc1	And now you're telling me it was all\nan illusion...? I still can't believe it...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310404.json
0	qc1	I heard that even the commander\ntook a little break.
1	qc1	The thing is, he came to back a mountain\nof paperwork. I'd never seen him look so\nexhausted...
2	3	Some break that turned out to be, huh...
3	qc1	But, he did look somewhat satisfied.\nSays he's got a whole new type of mission\nin mind now: natural spas.
4	qc1	I guess we've got you to thank\nfor his change of heart!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310405.json
0	qc1	Taking responsibility for our own actions...\nSuch a simple thing, but it was beyond us.
1	qc1	Starting now, that's a reality we all\nneed to come to terms with.
2	4	Don't forget that change is gradual.\nYou can't do it all at once!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310501.json
0	rc1	It really is a good thing that the\ncolony made its base here.
1	5	Oh yeah? Why d'you say that?
2	rc1	Well, it's a great position for defense\nfor one... Close to the tunnels, too.
3	rc1	We can't use the Ferronis, but I expect\nthere are still plenty of things we'll be\nable to manage around here.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310502.json
0	rc1	The canteen's ready for use now,\nthanks to all of you!
1	1	I'm glad to hear that!
2	rc1	Good thing we've got a decent food\nsupply. The location's not too bad, either!

evt/tlk/msg_tlk310503.json
0	5	How about you, Whitby?\nYou got some gripes with Lambda too?
1	rc1	Hmm. Well, we were never going to\nplease everyone the way things are.
2	rc1	We'd draw much closer together\nif they could just see things from\nthe commander's perspective...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310504.json
0	rc1	Hey, I hope you don't mind my asking,\nbut...what is a "spa", exactly?
1	6	Huh? Where's this come from?
2	rc1	The commander keeps asking everyone\nto join him on a trip to this "spa" place.
3	5	Ah... He's got spa on the brain, has he?
4	rc1	This is not answering my question...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310505.json
0	rc1	So the commander was waiting for us\nto change our way of thinking of our\nown accord...
1	2	Yeah, that's how it seems.
2	rc1	And here we were pushing off our\nresponsibilities instead of doing our job...
3	rc1	He's on another level, is our\ncommander. We were so used\nto blindly receiving orders...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310601.json
0	sc1	Right then, I'd better get round to\ninspecting the Auto-Levs.
1	sc1	If someone were to attack us in\nour current state, we'd be flattened\nin minutes...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310602.json
0	sc1	Thanks for helping us recover the\nAuto-Levs. I'll have them up and running\nin no time.
1	6	Oh yeah? You think you can\npinpoint the problem?
2	sc1	Sure thing! I am the colony technologist\nafter all. I'll figure it out, just you wait.
3	sc1	Auto-Levs really are indispensable for\nLambda, so I'm itching to get to work!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310603.json
0	sc1	Thanks for all your help!\nThe Auto-Lev's gliding like silk now.
1	5	It better, after all the shenanigans\nyou've put us through...
2	2	If by "us", you mean "Mio".
3	sc1	Look on the bright side: now everyone\nat Lambda has some peace of mind.
4	sc1	Colony Lambda's former glory can still\nbe restored. This is the first step of the\nrebuilding process!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310604.json
0	1	How's it looking?
1	sc1	Well, this is my first time tinkering with\na Kevesi Levnis, so I'm not entirely sure...
2	sc1	But if you look past the exterior,\nthe guts are really very similar.
3	sc1	In fact...I'd say that everything\npoints to them being built by the\nsame individual. Hmmm...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310605.json
0	5	So, Varen got a little help from us.\nBut is he like, a decent engineer?
1	sc1	Oh yeah, Varen's the real deal.\nIn fact, he's probably lined up to\nbe the next head of engineering.
2	sc1	He really takes concern for the colony to\nheart, and he's a hard worker to boot.
3	4	Yes... I'm certain Varen will\nmake a good leader.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310606.json
0	sc1	I see now that we never had to rely on\nAuto-Lev tech to fight. We can do just\nfine if we simply work together.
1	sc1	It was good that we did. It's all too\neasy to feel like we're untouchable,\nhere in our little bubble.
2	4	Yes. Correct.
3	sc1	Blessed with our resources, it'd be\ndecent of us to share them with some\nof the other colonies.
4	sc1	It won't do us any good to stay holed up\nin our hideaway. We need to get out and\nsee what's out there!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310701.json
0	tc1	We'll need an Auto-Lev if we're\ngoing to put this plan into effect.
1	tc1	I need to talk to the commander\nabout this, and quickly...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310702.json
0	tc1	You guys really helped us out, big time.
1	1	Oh, uh... We did?
2	tc1	With the tunnel collapse, I mean.\nAnd the Auto-Lev stuff.
3	tc1	We can even do a bit of ether mining\nnow too, thanks to you lot.
4	tc1	Cheers for that!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310703.json
0	5	Huh? I thought you were all down\nin the dumps since the sergeant\ngot mad at you...?
1	tc1	Well, you're not wrong. It's definitely\na nifty bit of kit, but I shouldn't have\ndisregarded protocol.
2	tc1	What we need to be thinking about\nright now is what's best for Lambda.
3	tc1	So, yeah, I can't be moping around.\nI got stuff to do!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310704.json
0	tc1	Hey, do you lot know Selin\nfrom Colony Tau?
1	6	Yeah, of course. Why do you ask?
2	tc1	Sounds like he found some resources\nwith that probe we lent him.
3	tc1	And that's pretty good news! I think\nwe can expect a great relationship with\nColony Tau in the near future!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310705.json
0	tc1	I'm glad they let Koji go. He's a\nreally important friend to me.
1	1	Did you speak with Koji already?
2	tc1	Yeah. Seemed like he understood\nhe'd made some poor decisions.
3	tc1	But Koji's a vital member of the team here.\nWith more cooperation, I'm sure we'll\nmake Colony Lambda even better.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310706.json
0	tc1	Colony Lambda managed to harness the\nstrength of all its soldiers and somehow got\nthe Ferronis back on its feet.
1	tc1	...Still doesn't look like\nyou can go inside, though.
2	tc1	Seems getting big jobs done without help\nfrom the nation's top brass will be a pain\nand a half...

1	uc1	I'll bet this puts a spanner in the\nworks of quite a few plans.
2	6	Sorry, I guess that's on us...
3	uc1	No, don't apologize. You weren't wrong\nto do what you did. It wasn't a mistake.

0	uc1	So you guys are working with us\non the ether mining, is that right?
1	4	I wouldn't necessarily say that.\nIt was a minor contribution at best.
2	uc1	Well, whatever. If you hadn't have lent\na hand, we'd have had considerable\nsetbacks for sure.
3	uc1	I expect the ether mine's going to be\na key asset for Colony Lambda, too.
4	uc1	So yeah, thanks a bunch for all that!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310803.json
0	5	What's up?\nSomething on your mind?
1	uc1	Hmm. Well...
2	uc1	I was just thinking that what Lambda\nneeds is more people who can take swift,\ndecisive action, like you guys.
3	uc1	I mean, if the colony can't respond to\nthings flexibly, then sooner or later...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310804.json
0	6	You better behave from now on, mister!
1	uc1	Ah, you lot... I hate that I had\nto rope you into all this along\nwith Lambda...
2	4	For better or worse, your actions\nhave shaped the future of Lambda.
3	uc1	Oh, I didn't do squat, really...\nThat was all you and the commander.
4	uc1	So, thank you. I'll work like a mudder to\nhelp everyone out from now on.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310901.json
0	vc1	The commander was the one who\npushed to get the Auto-Levs deployed.
1	vc1	They've been pivotal to our defense, but\nwe don't have many left standing now...
2	vc1	With things as they are, I don't think\nwe've much chance of getting more\nfrom our usual supplier.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310902.json
0	vc1	Commander Isurd's been starting\nto spend a fair bit of time away from\nColony Lambda lately.
1	3	Worried the colony won't hold up?
2	vc1	Nah, nothing like that. It's our job to\nsupport the commander here, after all.
3	vc1	It's a wonder he's able to carry\nout his own duties on top of all\nthe courtesy calls...
4	vc1	We've got to try and be more considerate.\nDon't wanna wear him out any more than\nhe already is...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310903.json
0	2	What's, uh, going on around here?
1	vc1	Oh, this? We've been prepping for\nbattle with Colony 5 and Colony 30,\nor whoever.
2	6	But...you know you don't really need\nto fight them any more, right?
3	vc1	Maybe so, but we still have enemies,\ndon't we? Got to prepare for the worst\neventualities.
4	vc1	Ultimately, I'm still doing pretty much\nthe same as I always do. Beats sitting\naround on my arse!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310904.json
0	vc1	Koji's a real idiot...
1	vc1	His recklessness was what\ngot us all into this mess.
2	vc1	It's a good thing he's in solitary now.\nHe can put that fevered imagination of\nhis on ice for a little while.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk310905.json
0	1	You've been through a lot lately...\nAre you holding up OK, Tulgrim?
1	vc1	Yeah... But I'm feeling it, you know?\nA weird sensation, right in my chest.
2	1	A weird sensation... What like, exactly?
3	vc1	Well, ever since we started acting\nindependently, Lambda's become like\na whole different entity now.
4	vc1	Changing things up without waiting for\ndirections... It's actually kind of nice.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk311001.json
0	2	Say, what kind of person\nwould you say Isurd is?
1	wc1	Ah... You want to know about\nthe commander, do you?
2	wc1	Our commander's one of the most\nexceptional Healers in Agnus. His attacks\nare nothing to be sniffed at either.
3	wc1	When his team need no more attention,\nhe'll switch to offense and pull everyone\nout of dire straits with his Talent Art.
4	wc1	It's not often we get to fight by his side\ngiven his role as a leader, but when he\ndoes step in, it's a real sight to behold.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk311002.json
0	wc1	You were helping out Kitty, right?
1	5	That's one way to put it...\nShe kinda dragged us into it, mate.
2	2	If by "us", you mean "Mio".
3	wc1	Well, however it shook out, thanks.\nAuto-Levs are absolutely vital for defense.
4	wc1	There are spots that we don't have the\nwherewithal to defend, but with Auto-Levs,\nwe've got all our bases covered.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk311003.json
0	wc1	I heard Orsolya went down...
1	4	You were acquainted with her?
2	wc1	Yeah, 'course. Fought her in\nskirmishes a couple of times.
3	wc1	Colony 5 was a pretty tough adversary.\nAnd Orsolya was one of their strongest.
4	wc1	I don't know anything about her final\nmoments. She might have been a bitter\nenemy, but it's still sad she's gone...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk311004.json
0	wc1	Hey, you lot kept in touch with\nShijima, didn't you?
1	1	Yeah... Not so much. But I heard\nthat Moraine sent him off.
2	wc1	Shijima could be cowardly, weak. But he\nput the colony above everything else.
3	wc1	He was the same term as me, and my\nbest friend. It was a beautiful ceremony...
4	wc1	I'll do everything I can to make sure his\nmemory stays alive in Colony Lambda.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk311005.json
0	3	Hey, you. You've really been\ncrushing it lately!
1	wc1	Oh, come off it. Only because\nI got so much help from you.
2	wc1	I'll never forget what you did for me here.\nJust remember, Lambda's got your back.
3	wc1	If anyone dares to take you on,\nthey'll have to answer to us first!
4	wc1	That's the least we can do. We owe it\nto Shijima and all our fallen comrades.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk311101.json
0	xc1	Are you headed for Keves Castle?
1	xc1	If so, you'll want to ascend the great falls,\nand then cut through Maktha Wildwood.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk311102.json
0	xc1	Here at Lambda, all the teams consult\neach other for approval before acting.
1	xc1	We're led on the basis of clear principles.\nThat's what allows us to grow as a strong,\npowerful colony.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk311103.json
0	1	Those sensors Varen set up...\nAre they working all right?
1	xc1	Oh, so it seems. I'm not convinced they're\nexactly in the best of spots, though.
2	1	How do you mean...?
3	xc1	Well, Maktha Wildwood opens out onto\nthe upper levels of the great falls.
4	xc1	In my opinion, that's the kind of place\nyou should have been looking at...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk311104.json
0	xc1	Is Lambda really going to be OK\nthe way things are...?
1	xc1	If Taion and the others hadn't been\naround in that battle, it's highly likely\nwe'd have taken a good kicking.
2	xc1	Since when did we become\nso weak...? And why...?
3	4	...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk311105.json
0	xc1	I don't think many of us really\nknew how Commander Isurd had\nbeen thinking about things.
1	xc1	Captain Rosh had a few ideas that we\nwouldn't have really expected, too.
2	xc1	Goes to show you, doesn't it? The captain\ncan come off as a bit of a slob sometimes,\nbut his head really is in the right place.
3	xc1	I've taken that on board. I need to\nstart thinking for myself, too.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk311201.json

1	yc1	Thanks for your purchase!\nCome again!
2	yc1	You're always welcome here!

0	@c1	Welcoming to shop.
1	@c1	Many thankings for business.
2	@c1	Waiting patiently for future visits!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320101.json
0	_c1	Juniper's even more skilled with\na bow than me, you know...
1	_c1	I doubt you'll have to worry about it, but\nour commander's never left Tau before.\nMake sure you protect them in battle.
2	_c1	Get Juniper to target the enemy's rear.\nAnd make sure our eminent archer\ndoesn't end up in the line of fire.
3	_c1	Taking down your prey unawares...\nThat's the hunter's way.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320102.json
0	_c1	So, I'm hearing there's some monster\nin the forest that doesn't belong.\nI have to say, I'm curious.
1	1	You're familiar with all the monsters\nthat inhabit this area, then?
2	_c1	Naturally. Hunting is how\nwe live, after all.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320103.json
0	_c1	I've gotta apologize.\nI'm ashamed of the way I acted...
1	5	Relax, mate. I'm a\ngive-and-take kind of guy.
2	_c1	Well... I appreciate it.
3	_c1	The Consul may be gone, but things are\nstill tough in Colony Tau at the moment.
4	_c1	But I'm going to do everything\nI can to bounce back and really\nstart contributing again.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320104.json
0	_c1	I got myself all wrapped up in the idea\nthat I had to tell everyone what's what\nbecause I was the eldest...
1	_c1	But in reality I was going nowhere,\nshutting down the change we needed in\nthe colony. Blind and deaf to the truth...
2	_c1	We don't have to live in desperation.\nLooks like I've got a bit of evolution to\ndo myself.
3	1	I think you're right about that.\nYou could pull Colony Tau along\nwith you in the process.
4	_c1	I could indeed. Whatever's in my power\nnot to get left in the dust...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320105.json
0	_c1	Yeah, looks like a pretty\ntight spot, all right.
1	2	So you know, huh?
2	_c1	We can't exactly leave the colony,\nbut we'll defend it tooth and nail,\njust you see.
3	_c1	You and Juniper take 'em\ndown good for us, OK?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320201.json
0	Wd1	Oh! It's you!
1	1	None other! So you've been\nvisiting Lambda, Selin!
2	Wd1	Yeah. It's a really awesome colony.\nI'm learning new stuff every day.
3	Wd1	Have you met Varen from the engineering\ncorps? He's been good enough to school\nme on some new things.
4	Wd1	He's a really great guy. I'll be putting all\nhis advice to good use, that's for sure.\nLook forward to a whole new Colony Tau!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320202.json
0	5	Think you'll be able to get those\nresources mined at a decent clip?
1	Wd1	Well, we won't be able to extract them\nen masse the way Lambda does...
2	Wd1	We're at a point now where we can\nwork in stages, removing them bit by bit.
3	Wd1	It's probably not much to shout\nhome about, but I think it'll be a\nbig step forward for Tau!
4	5	That's the spirit, mate.\nMore power to your elbow!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320203.json
0	Wd1	Cardamine really appreciated the\nlengths you guys went to, you know.
1	2	What did we do?
2	Wd1	You sent off our off-seer, for one!
3	Wd1	Cardamine blamed himself for the off-seer's\ndeath. He'd been beating himself up about\nit for so long, it was painful to see.
4	Wd1	He's found his way again now,\nthough, thanks to all you've done.\nIt's above and beyond, really it is.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320204.json
0	Wd1	Looks like Raine really put his\nfoot in it, huh. Sorry about that.
1	4	Think nothing of it.
2	Wd1	He's just so dead set on trying to\nfix everything by himself.
3	Wd1	Our old commander appointed Juniper\nas successor, but he also asked Raine to\nassist. Guess he really took that to heart.
4	Wd1	Raine's an important part of the colony.\nI'm glad we didn't lose him.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320301.json
0	Xd1	It's in decline now, but this place still\nremains an important strategic position\nfor Agnus.
1	4	Strategic? Could you elaborate?
2	Xd1	It can be used as a point of ambush\nwhen Keves Castle or one of the\ncolonies launch an attack, for one.
3	4	A last line of defense... That tracks,\ngiven this vast expanse of forest.
4	Xd1	But anyway, it's a moot point.\nThere's been no conflict or flare-ups\nfor quite some time now.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320302.json
0	Xd1	When hunting our prey, we still\nour breath and wait for the perfect\nmoment to strike.
1	Xd1	Seems like our way of fighting\ndidn't work against you, though.
2	3	Yeah, well it didn't stop you from\nscarin' the crap outta me!
3	Xd1	Haha! I guess we still\nhaven't lost it, then!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320303.json
0	1	Could you tell us a bit more\nabout Colony Tau's customs?
1	Xd1	Our customs? Let's see...\nWell, our current commander always\nhas to appoint the next in line...
2	Xd1	We fetch water from a distant spring...
3	Xd1	And we don't send off our dead.\nInstead we bury them in the earth.
4	1	These all sound so foreign to us...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320304.json
0	Xd1	Wait, so... The water from the Spring\nof Rhonnar wasn't even special?!
1	2	It seems not!
2	Xd1	You're joking... So what was the\npoint of us lugging ourselves all the\nway over there time after time?
3	Xd1	Friends have been injured on\nthat trip, all because we thought\nthat water gave us strength...
4	3	Well, now you won't have to, 'cause\nyou can get water that's just as good\npractically on your doorstep!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320305.json
0	Xd1	Colony Tau must have a lot of\nweird customs, right?
1	6	Yeah, you probably have the\nConsul to blame for that...
2	Xd1	I don't know... I think a lot of them\nmust've been passed down from the old\ncommander and his predecessors too.
3	4	Perhaps you ought not to carry on every\nlittle tradition so willingly unless you can\nidentify a clear benefit.
4	Xd1	Hm, maybe so. Thanks for\nthe food for thought!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320401.json
0	Yd1	You're looking to go to Keves Castle?
1	Yd1	Then you need to go back from the top\nof Tau to the place where we fought.
2	Yd1	There's a rope slide there you can\nmake use of to get you on your way.
3	Yd1	Careful you don't descend too far, though.\nThe monsters down there are formidable.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320402.json
0	1	Hey...would you mind telling us a bit\nmore about your former commander?
1	Yd1	Not at all. He had a strong sense\nof responsibility. Very gentle by nature.
2	Yd1	And an inspiring figure. I think\nevery one of us was willing to\nlay down our lives for him.
3	2	He sounds like he was a wonderful person.
4	Yd1	That he was. Now Juniper fills\nhis shoes, and is every bit the\ncommander he was.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320403.json
0	Yd1	It's a relief to hear that\nImogen's safe and sound.
1	Yd1	I was getting worried, because I knew\nsomething was definitely up with her.\nI just couldn't place it...
2	Yd1	Anyway, what matters is\nshe's alive and well!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320404.json
0	Yd1	I still can't believe the Consul\nplayed us for such fools...
1	Yd1	How could I be so blind?!
2	4	But at least the threat is no more.\nYou ought to look to the future now,\nnot wallow in regret.
3	Yd1	You're right, of course! It's no time\nfor gloom and bitterness. Looking to\nthe future, yes! I'll do just that!
4	3	He's a perky one, that's for sure.\nProbably for the best, right now.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320405.json
0	Yd1	You...you were in the lower levels?!
1	1	I, uh...suppose we were, yeah.
2	Yd1	What were you thinking?!\nYou could've got yourselves all killed...
3	Yd1	There's a cave home to the most\nterrible monsters down where you\nand Raine went.
4	Yd1	Steer well clear of it, you hear?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320406.json
0	Yd1	If you wanna survive in this here\nMaktha Wildwood, you'll need to\nlearn about mushrooms.
1	6	Mushrooms...? Why mushrooms?
2	Yd1	Hah, well. They may look fun and all, but\nyou'd better not be underestimating them.
3	Yd1	Some mushrooms are priceless treasures.\nOthers are toxic like you wouldn't believe.\n...The Naiti-Nait takes the crown there.
4	Yd1	You eat one of them by mistake, then the\nnext thing you know, you might wake up\ninside some monster's stomach!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320501.json
0	2	Huh... Aren't you from Colony Tau?
1	Zd1	Oh, it's you! Yes, I came here to\nlearn what I could about Levnises.
2	Zd1	Hard to concentrate with all these\nfuzzballs around though...
3	3	Fuzzballs? You mean Nopon?
4	Zd1	Yes, that's right. I'm beginning\nto wonder what the point of me\neven coming here was...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320502.json
0	Zd1	I admit it, I was wrong.\nNopon engineering is the real deal.
1	Zd1	I'll see to it that the things I learned in\nColony 30 will really put Tau on the map!
2	1	No more flying off the\nhandle at Nopon, then?
3	Zd1	Oh, no worries on that front.\nWe're all perfectly harmonious!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320503.json
0	Zd1	I tried making some dishes with\nthe meat smoker. It's been a real hit!
1	5	And you didn't even tell us?\nI feel so betrayed...
2	Zd1	Haha, sorry about that!\nI'll tell you next time, I promise.
3	Zd1	It's always nice to eat in good\ncompany. The more the merrier!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320504.json
0	Zd1	I'm working on something really big\nwith the Nopon here.
1	Zd1	Give or take another five years and\nI reckon we'll be able to blast that\nbig ol' sphere to smithereens.
2	4	Not everyone can wait that long, sadly...
3	Zd1	Yeah, I'd rather we were victorious\nwithin your lifetime. I'm sorry we can't\nbe of much help...
4	Zd1	But we'll support you from back here.\nWe believe in you, in your struggle.

2	ad1	Uh...? What...? Ah...
3	6	...Sorry...?
4	2	She seems a bit preoccupied.\nLet's give her some space.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320602.json
0	6	Are you gonna be OK, Imogen?
1	ad1	I know I came to Colony 4 for the\nwrong reasons, after the Flame Clock\nstopped tying me down.
2	ad1	But seeing everyone working so hard\nhere... It made me realize I couldn't just\nkeep going on the way I was.
3	ad1	Life's not easy, but we have to keep\npushing on. For all our sakes...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320603.json
0	ad1	You know, I was sure that\nthis time Raine was dead meat.
1	5	Well, that's grim.
2	ad1	Hey, that doesn't mean I'm not glad\nhe's alive. I have so much to tell him\nabout what I learned in Colony 4.
3	ad1	Can't have him dying on us\nprematurely now, can we?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320604.json
0	ad1	I hope Colony 4's going to be OK...
1	ad1	The attacks from that sphere came\ncrashing down in the Fornis region.\nThat really had me worrying.
2	1	I understand how you feel.\nBut please don't get out there\nand do anything rash, OK?
3	ad1	Yeah, I know. I know.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320701.json
0	bd1	All the troops at Colony Tau\nmake good use of rope slides.
1	bd1	It's worth getting used to the idea that\nyou can make a handy journey anywhere\nfrom Tau as long as you have rope.
2	5	Handy! I'll say!
3	bd1	Takes a bit of getting used to, but I'm\nsure you lot will take it in your stride!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320702.json
0	bd1	Raine never knows when to quit.\nI guarantee you he'll try to do something\nrash again soon enough.
1	3	Yeah? Well, make sure you keep\nhim in check before that happens.
2	bd1	Oh, I will! He may be a maniac,\nbut he's still my friend.
3	bd1	If I hadn't got myself injured, we\ncould've gone out hunting together...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320703.json
0	bd1	Sometimes you can hear the sounds of\nbattle over from the mountain path.
1	bd1	I doubt it'll ever encroach\nas far as here, though.
2	6	It pays to be cautious, though,\ndon't you think?
3	bd1	There aren't many of us, so frontal\nassaults are a no-go. We have our\nown ways of doing things.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320704.json
0	bd1	I'd never have imagined that the\nConsul's true colors were so dark...
1	bd1	I daresay others have suffered at\nthe hands of other Consuls, too.
2	bd1	They've got to be defeated and brought to\naccount for that. I don't want anyone else\nto have to go through this!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320705.json
0	bd1	My injuries are all healed up now,\nwhich means I can go back to hunting\nwith Raine again.
1	4	As long as you both stay vigilant.
2	bd1	Raine's a changed man after what he went\nthrough, so I wouldn't worry about that.
3	bd1	Though I doubt it'll put him off hunting\naltogether. He was truly alive back then...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320801.json
0	cd1	Ahh... It's such an enormous relief\nnot to have to fight any more...
1	cd1	I never really liked fighting, to tell you\nthe truth. Juniper made exactly the right\ncall, as far as I'm concerned!
2	cd1	Our Flame Clock was burning out...\nI thought that was going to be the\nend of us.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320802.json
0	cd1	Thanks a lot for dealing\nwith the Tirkins.
1	cd1	There's a lot of those featherheads\naround here. I think it's better that\nwe keep up our alliance.
2	cd1	We're going to be hard-pressed to\nkeep sending them tributes, though...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320803.json
0	3	Guess you're in the birdhouse with the\nTirkins now, eh? Hope you don't regret it.
1	cd1	Like I said, I'm happy to leave\nthat kettle of fish entirely in\nJuniper's hands.
2	cd1	It might be annoying having to\ndeal with them when we go into\nthe forest now, sure...
3	cd1	But at least we won't have to\ngive up our hard-earned food.\nAnd for that, I'm grateful.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320804.json
0	cd1	I knew all along, you know...
1	2	Huh? Knew what?
2	cd1	The reason why Tau's in the forest.\nIt was all the Consul, wasn't it?
3	cd1	You can't grow any decent crops\nin the forest. We should have been\nin a place with better soil!
4	3	Uh... It's possible, I guess?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320805.json
0	cd1	I'm glad our alliance with the Tirkins is still\nin place. They helped Raine out, right?
1	5	Yeah, seems the birdbrains were\nkeeping him cooped up safe.
2	cd1	You know, I gotta give them respect.
3	cd1	I should bring them some\nTirkingrass as thanks!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320806.json
0	cd1	Am I hearing this right?\nThe Tirkins tried to *eat* Raine?!
1	6	Yeah... If we'd shown up any later,\nstuff could've turned ugly...
2	cd1	They're incorrigible! If I ever set eyes on\nthem, I'll roast them in their own juices!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320807.json
0	cd1	Hey there! Have you been making\nthe most of all the rope slides?
1	2	Yeah! They've made getting around\nthe forest a real breeze, thanks!
2	cd1	Well, here's a tip then - there's plenty more\nto be found, strung around all over the world.
3	cd1	You'll find them useful, that's a guarantee.\nAnd whenever you do, be grateful to Juniper\nfor teaching you this life-changing skill!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320901.json
0	4	So the Consul rarely visits...\nIs that correct?
1	dd1	Right. Once a year, if we're lucky.\nClearly, we're not of much interest.
2	dd1	I mean, we're not exactly on the map\nhere. Nowhere to go, nothing to see.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320902.json
0	dd1	A thought occurred to me when\nI went to check on the fields.
1	1	Oh yeah?
2	dd1	What are harvests like in other\ncolonies? There must be plenty\nof big plots out there...
3	5	Yeah, uh... Your average colony\ndoesn't actually have any fields.
4	dd1	They...don't?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320903.json
0	6	You have an elevator here,\nbut you don't use it...?
1	dd1	As I understand it, it's been locked\never since the Tirkins invaded us a\nfew decades ago.
2	dd1	We just leave it as it is. Getting it back\nonline would mean going down to the\nlower levels, you see.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320904.json
0	dd1	Ah... You got the elevator running again.
1	3	No worries. It was a piece of cake.\nHardly broke a sweat.
2	dd1	You guys are really something!\nGetting down there's no joke!
3	dd1	I'm not sure our people will have\nany desire to use it, though...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk320905.json
0	dd1	How are you all doing?\nI'm feeling quite good, myself.
1	dd1	Tau's been through a lot, but\nyou've set it on the right course.
2	dd1	I hope it'll continue to develop and\nbecome something wonderful.

evt/tlk/msg_tlk320906.json
0	dd1	Hm? That smell...\nI'm guessing...Sirius Anemone?
1	4	Ah, yes... I have a personal stash of it.\nI like to keep some on hand to make\nherbal tea with.
2	dd1	Oh wow, didn't take you for a tea guy!\nWell then, I've got a tip for you, so listen up.
3	dd1	Try making tea from Mallow-o'-the-Marsh.\nIt's a fungus - quite pungent, but great for\nyour health. It builds strength, apparently!
4	4	Hmm... Understood, thank you.\nI'll be sure to make a note of it.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk321001.json
0	ed1	Looks like a bunch of our folks\nwill be heading out to the other\ncolonies that you've liberated.
1	ed1	It's like Juniper says. We should\nlook forward to getting out there\nand seeing new things.
2	2	Is that what you're going to do?\nGet out in the world?
3	ed1	No... If I left, there'd be no one here\nto take care of the wounded.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk321002.json
0	ed1	Thanks for helping us out with\nthe harvest. You don't know just\nhow much you've helped.
1	5	Ah, it was nothin'. Just as long as\nyou give us our grub's worth!
2	ed1	Oh, count on it. It'll be a\nveritable vegetable feast!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk321003.json
0	1	How's Raine holding up?
1	ed1	Hmm. Nothing a good bit of\nrest and relaxation won't fix.
2	ed1	I've got to keep a close eye on him,\nthough. You never know when he might\ntry to wander off again by himself...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk321004.json
0	ed1	It's a trickle, but my friends are\nfinally starting to come back.
1	ed1	You don't realize just how precious\nthey are until they're gone. They really\ndo mean the world to me...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk321005.json
0	ed1	Raine's injury's finally healed.
1	5	Yeah? Hope he doesn't take that to\nmean he can start doing whatever.
2	ed1	We took down all the monsters that\nthe Consul released, so as long as he\nsticks close to home, he should be safe.
3	ed1	Then again, he is the kind of person\nwho throws caution to the wind...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk321006.json
0	ed1	I'm convinced the Consul was\nthe one who conceived the Hunt\nof Plenty. It was a vile custom.
1	ed1	So many hopefuls ventured out there,\nonly to meet their demise...
2	ed1	Really, how dare she!
3	3	But you've all washed your\nhands of it now, right?
4	ed1	That we have. From now on, our\ntraditions will be far more wholesome.

1	5	Hey, never mind that lot right now.\nHere's where the danger is. Aren't\nyou gonna evacuate?
2	fd1	Yeah... I'm not worried though. Not with\nall the new friends I've made around here!
3	fd1	When the time comes, I'll get out of here\nwith everyone else from the colony, so\ndon't worry about me!

2	ge1	If a woman doesn't eat, she starves.\nAnd if she doesn't fight, it's Colony 11\nthat starves.
3	ge1	If you insist on standing above us,\nthen you need to beware of the hungry\nbeasts beneath you.
4	5	Give me a break...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410204.json
0	ge1	I gave Branden some of the meat\nfrom the big game I took down earlier.\nYou should have some!
1	3	Huh, well OK... Any reason?
2	ge1	Call it a good luck ritual. A hunt to\ncelebrate your imminent victory!
3	3	Now that, I can understand.\nThanks, love!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410205.json
0	ge1	Husk soldiers... Now the cat's out of the\nbag, it doesn't even seem that interesting.\nWhat a letdown!
1	ge1	I mean, you can't expect much of a challenge\nfrom a bunch of soulless shells. Snuff me,\nthough. If the Consuls stooped any lower...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410301.json
0	he1	...
1	3	What are you looking at?
2	he1	...
3	3	...OK then...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410302.json
0	he1	...
1	3	Sorry bud, we'll have to table\nthe rematch for another time.\nKinda busy right now.
2	he1	...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410303.json
0	3	So you can actually talk... Even if it is\nlike a creep.
1	he1	...
2	3	Oops, back to our usual chatty\nself, are we? Doesn't make much\ndifference to me.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410304.json
0	he1	...
1	3	Yeah, we brought your deserters\nback to you. Take care of 'em, eh?
2	he1	...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410305.json
0	he1	...
1	3	We get it. When we've dealt with Moebius,\nwe'll take you on, just like we promised.
2	6	You can understand him? Whoa.
3	3	Yeah, I dunno...\nGuess I'm just used to it somehow?
4	he1	...Heh.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410307.json
0	he1	...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410401.json
0	ie1	Ahh, you all must be something if you\ncan win over Zor like that.
1	ie1	He may have a screw loose just like\nour glorious leader, but he makes a\nkind of sense.
2	ie1	Please try and get to know him. If he\nstarts getting obsessed with you, maybe I\ncan get some unauthorized R&R...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410402.json
0	ie1	Oh, I just wanted to say - please\ndon't ask me about my old colony.
1	5	You know the first thing I want\nto do now is pry, don't you?
2	ie1	There are others you could ask instead of\nme, but... Most people have a reason for\nbeing here. They've got some real issues.
3	ie1	People like me who were transferred here\nby an angry superior are commonplace\nenough to be boring, so let's not talk about it.
4	3	Not the reason I was expecting...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410403.json
0	ie1	Things are looking dicey right now,\naren't they? Ah, it's nothing to do\nwith me, of course.
1	1	That's...certainly a statement...
2	ie1	Cut your cloth according to your jib,\nthey say. Should be clear to anyone that\na nobody like me has no part in this.
3	ie1	You, on the other hand, have a real part\nto play. Better hop to it, then - the world's\nnot going to save itself!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410404.json
0	ie1	Uff, I just knew this would take it out\nof me. Think I'll just...back myself up\nout of the picture.
1	3	You're just itching to skive off, aren't ya?\nI'll report you to Zoren for that!
2	ie1	Please, be my guest. If there's one\nthing I'm good at, it's being quick on\nmy feet. He'll never catch me!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410501.json
0	je1	I knew it. You all give off a different\nscent than usual...
1	6	Ew, I don't stink of sweat do I?!
2	je1	No, it's more like the scent of someone\nabout to be entangled in something\ncomplicated. It's most stimulating.
3	6	Whaaaat.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410502.json
0	je1	People usually fear that which is different\nfrom themselves. Especially if they...\ndon't conform to the norm.
1	3	You being a good example?
2	je1	I suppose so. But here it's only natural\nto be a non-conformist. So not conforming\nactually becomes the norm...
3	je1	Any weirdo can be themselves here\nand no one will pay them any mind...\nHehe...
4	3	...Yyyyep.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410503.json
0	je1	What a curious scent...\nIt's so different from before...
1	3	Uhm... You talking about us?
2	je1	It's hard to put into words.\nFierce determination... Righteous anger...\nDivine purpose...
3	je1	In any case, it's a very nice smell.
4	3	Still as cryptic as ever, huh.\nBut I'll take the compliment.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410504.json
0	je1	Oh...that stench... No. It was horrid.
1	3	What are you talking about now?
2	je1	Those soldiers... There was something...\ninorganic about them. I didn't smell\nanything alive on them at all.
3	je1	But...if they were husks, then it makes\nperfect sense. I'll never get used to\ntheir fetid smell...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410601.json
0	ke1	That hunt was fun! You should definitely\njoin us again...to carry our prey home.
1	3	...Someday I'm gonna make you\ntalk straight.
2	ke1	Ahahaha, you say the oddest things!\nThen do it, if you can...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410602.json
0	ke1	I sense that those in power are all so\nfocused on the final battle, they hardly\nhave time to worry about themselves.
1	ke1	Perhaps this is a ripe opportunity to do\naway with the Queen of Keves and seize\nthe throne for myself, hmm?
2	3	Oh yeah, sounds fantastic.\nSo once Moebius are dead and buried,\nwe'll be coming for you next then!
3	ke1	Ahahaha! I jest!\nCan't you people take a joke?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410603.json
0	ke1	Honestly, Captain Easel's quite\na slave-driver...
1	ke1	One minute you think she's gone, then\nthe next she's telling you to go fetch\nthis or fetch that.
2	ke1	I think...I might have to assassinate her.\nOuroboros, help a girl out?
3	6	Huh?! What a thing to come out with\nall of a sudden!
4	3	Just ignore her, Sena, or you'll\nend up as crazy as she is.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410604.json
0	ke1	Soldiers that don't die when you\nslaughter them... That's a dirty trick.\nWhere's the fun in that?
1	ke1	But, hmm... I suppose if they never die,\nthen perhaps they could be tortured...\neternally...
2	ke1	Ah! What a missed opportunity...\nI could have taken one or two captive\nand entertained myself with them...
3	3	I'll pretend I didn't hear any of that.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410605.json
0	3	You know, what I heard in that Sitre\nwoman wasn't any old fear. What in the\nQueen's dimples did you do to her?
1	ke1	Weeell, that Sitre seemed a bit too\nprideful and up herself for my liking.\nWouldn't you agree?
2	ke1	I just wanted to see how far I'd have to\ngo before she'd abandon her idiot pride.\nIt was an itch that just needed scratching...
3	3	Forget it.\nJust forget I asked, please.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410701.json
0	le1	Come to the canteen if you\never want some more food.
1	le1	In case you didn't know, cooking meat is\nmy specialty. Meat's surely the best for\nstamina and power in battle.
2	5	Truer words were never spoken!\nI think you and I are gonna get along!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410702.json
0	le1	In times like these, death could be lurking\njust around the corner. Eat well while you\ncan, and fortify your courage.
1	5	Oh yeah? Sounds like an invitation to\nstuff our faces with your meaty cuisine.
2	le1	Haha! It's very heartening to hear you say\nthat! I'll make sure to serve you nothing\nbut the best!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410703.json
0	le1	Hey, you see how I handle a\nBlade? Not bad, eh?
1	le1	My shoulders get stiff cooking all day,\nso joining a battle every now and then\ndoes my body good!
2	1	This is the first time I've\nseen a cook fight like that.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410704.json
0	le1	Ashera's quiet... Usually she's so\nfull of energy. Did something happen\nto her during the fight with R?
1	3	Ah... Kinda...
2	le1	I see... Maybe I should cook up some of\nthose super-spicy dishes she likes then,\nif it'll help cheer her up.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410705.json
0	le1	I owe my love of cooking and the\nfundamentals I know to the proprietress\nof the Tap-Dancing Nopon.
1	le1	When I was lying nearly lifeless on the\nbattlefield, and she fed me that diced meat\nstew...that was what changed my world.
2	4	So, that's what made you switch\nto being a cook?
3	le1	Well, it was Zoren that sorted out my\nswitch for me, so I don't just have the\nproprietress to thank, but him, too.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410801.json
0	me1	I don't think I can remember the\nlast time I saw the boss in such\nhigh spirits! Ha-hah!
1	5	Since he never says a word and\nhides his face, I think I can see why...
2	me1	You just have to get used to his\nways! You should get to know us\nbetter, rebels!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410802.json
0	me1	Hey there! Everyone who ran from\nour unit is undergoing Knoquehardt's\nhighly-regarded training regime!
1	me1	That guy doesn't have an ounce of mercy!\nMaybe it's not a laughing matter... Gahaha!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410803.json
0	me1	Whoa-hoah-hoah! Here comes the big one!\nOrigin's gonna get a right good kicking!
1	me1	It's like someone blew the cap of the fun\npipe and it just keeps coming! A-mazing!\nYou lot just blow my mind! Hyarrgh!
2	3	The fun never stops with this one...
3	me1	Yeah! Since you guys came, the fun's\nbeen turned up to 11...or maybe 12!\nThe real victor... Fun! Hahahaha!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410804.json
0	me1	Oh! Such an assault of delicious events!\nI just wanted to whiz 'em up in a Consul\nsmoothie and neck 'em in one!
1	me1	So. How was it? Tell me. Was it fun?\nYour thrilling fight to the death?
2	3	No comment.
3	me1	I get it. It was so much fun, it defies\nwords. So. Jealous. Hyargh! Hahaha!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410901.json
0	ne1	Out of my sight! Just seeing your\nfaces gets my blood boiling!
1	4	Is that any way to talk to us, seeing\nas we so kindly helped you with your\ntraining, as requested?
2	ne1	Lies! The only reason you "helped" is\nbecause you trashed our Levnises!
3	3	Oof... I guess he's not wrong.
4	ne1	Grrrrrrr! If it wasn't for Captain Clad's\norders, I'd tear you apart right now!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410902.json
0	5	Hey. Why don't you let up\non those deserters a little?
1	ne1	Huh? Did you say something?\nToday I'm a little hard of hearing!
2	3	Give it up, Lanz. This guy's a lost cause.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410903.json
0	ne1	Why isn't my Levnis ready yet?\nThe maintenance never ends!\nI can't go into battle like this!
1	3	You probably don't want to hear it\nfrom us, but...could you try fighting\nwithout one, maybe?
2	ne1	Not a chance! I'll never give up that\nfeeling of power when I mow down my\nenemies! Hand-to-hand combat? Pah!
3	3	I see...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410904.json
0	ne1	You monster!!! I have to have my\nLevnis repaired again, and it's all your\nfault!
1	3	Yeah, deal with it mate!\nIf you don't like it, maybe you\nshouldn't have lost to us!
2	ne1	Graaaaaghh!!!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk410905.json
0	ne1	Bah... Bested by the walking dead!\nHave I fallen so far?
1	5	Don't look at it like that. In fact,\nI thought you held out pretty well.\nYou're a tough bloke.
2	ne1	Gah...! Don't think your flattery\nwill get you anywhere! That was\nwholly uncalled for!
3	3	I think he likes it.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk411701.json
0	do1	What is it you're looking for...?
1	do1	Heh heh... Do come again, won't you?
2	do1	Begone, if you have no business here.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk411801.json
0	eo1	Please, whatever friends want, it for sale.
1	eo1	Thanks much, pleasant business.
2	eo1	Friends will regret missing out sorely!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420101.json
0	se1	Oh, woe is me...
1	se1	(sigh)
2	se1	What do you want? Leave me be.\nCan't a man wallow in misery in peace?
3	se1	This is the piece I have most faith in,\namong all of my work! All my hopes go\nwith you!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420102.json
0	se1	You have revitalized my spirit!\nBreathed new life into my soul!
1	se1	I think, in fact, I will make it my mission\nto spread the culture K bequeathed me.
2	3	Good plan. Hope you can pull it off.
3	se1	Oh, I fully intend to. I'll show the world\nthere's more to life than just battle!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420201.json
0	te1	Tap-Dancing Nopon is favorite haunt of\nbig shots and mighty cheeses of Castle.
1	te1	Guard captain Sigrún, inspection person\nLuciona... Both come often!
2	te1	Panina recommend to try extra-special dish\nof Cured-Meat Vizzard! Friends sure to\nlove much!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420202.json
0	te1	Giddygiddy come over other day to\nplay little performance on instrument.
1	te1	Now Consul not here to forbid, could\nenjoy snacks and music at same time.\nSymphony in mouth and ears!
2	2	That sounds lovely. I wish I could\nhave been there to hear it.
3	te1	Yes, highly recommend\nnot to miss out next time!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420203.json
0	te1	Panina not seen Luciona lately.
1	te1	She good person who come by every\nday and praise Cured-Meat Vizzard\nof Panina!
2	te1	Panina hope she become less busy soon\nand come back again.
3	1	Oof...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420401.json
0	ve1	The Castle's Flame Clock, smashed...\nwhile we were out for the count.
1	ve1	Was it the Consul's plan, so\nthat we wouldn't get hurt...?
2	1	I'm not sure what to say...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420402.json
0	ve1	We have to polish our skills to a shine\nfor the return of our true Queen.
1	ve1	Heath and Wynonna are still wet behind\nthe ears, but then again so am I...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420403.json
0	ve1	Finally, I got to meet the true Queen.
1	ve1	It was as if I'd been struck by lightning.\nI mean...maybe I even was struck by\nsome of the lightning we get round here.
2	ve1	It was like a flash of revelation, to stand\nbefore her and think "this is our Queen!"
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420404.json
0	ve1	The Flame Clock has been destroyed,\nour true Queen has returned, and change\nis sweeping the Guard, as well.
1	ve1	We must purge the corruption that has\nbeen rotting through our ranks.
2	ve1	We must do away with all the\nstructures built in honor of the\nConsul and the fake Queen.
3	ve1	And when all that's done, I'd like\nHeath and Wynonna to usher in\na new era for us.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420501.json
0	we1	We've lost our Flame Clock,\njust like Agnus.
1	we1	What does it all mean? If the remaining\nFlame Clocks in the other colonies are\nbroken, will this be the end of war?
2	2	Well, the fighting between Agnus and\nKeves should stop, at least.
3	2	But until Moebius are defeated,\nthere will still be battles to fight.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420502.json
0	we1	You're the ones who gave Martina's\nlot a run for their money, right?
1	we1	They've always shown promise, that lot,\nbut after what you did, I think their hearts\nare in it now more than ever.
2	we1	They'll make fine soldiers for the Guard.
3	we1	...Not as fine as me, of course.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420503.json
0	we1	Moebius are about as tough as\nyou guys, aren't they?
1	we1	So we can't really say we can\nprotect the Queen till we can hold\nour own against you.
2	we1	Hrm... It's a long road ahead.
3	we1	Not just for Wynonna and me,\nbut for every one of us.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420504.json
0	we1	So Gustav showed his true colors.
1	we1	And I'm the one who didn't notice all that\nresentment he was carrying around...
2	1	You don't need to carry all that on your\nshoulders alone, Heath.
3	we1	You're probably right, but I could have seen\nit if I'd just looked outside the Guard...
4	we1	I might have put it together if I'd have\nnoticed the company he was keeping...and\nAionios'd be a touch cleaner.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420601.json
0	xe1	Even if there's an end to war, we the\nGuard will still be bound to the defense\nof Her Majesty. That won't change.
1	xe1	I think we'll just keep on training,\njust like we've always done.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420602.json
0	xe1	Thanks for entertaining us\nwith that mock battle.
1	xe1	You've taught me a very\nimportant lesson.
2	xe1	The way I was going, I probably would\nhave ended up losing to Pharod and the\nrest of the cadets.
3	xe1	I'll endeavor never to forget the\nimportance of working together with\none's teammates.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420603.json
0	xe1	I'd been looking into the location of the\nether cylinders on my side as well.
1	xe1	But there are auditors milling about all\nover the place, making it very difficult to\nget anywhere with the investigation.
2	4	Keeping a low profile should be your top\npriority. You're doing the right thing.
3	xe1	I know. I'm hoping the Guard can resolve\nthis incident, but let me know if you catch\nwind of any funny business.
4	5	Will do!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420604.json
0	xe1	Breaking the Flame Clock probably\nhad a big effect on the Castle inspectors.
1	xe1	The rest of us continue working under the\nQueen as before, but their entire job was\nbasically wiped out.
2	5	Yeah, but we can't just let this slide.
3	xe1	You're right... When we act, we have to\ntake into account the possibility that the\nchange will be difficult for many.
4	4	It'll be a gradual process, for sure.\nBut you have to start somewhere.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420701.json
0	ye1	We're assigned to inspection duty here.\nIt used to involve keeping an eye on the\ncolonies and communicating with them.
1	ye1	But, of course, things are in\na state of flux at the moment.
2	ye1	I don't think the colonies are really going\nto have any need of being inspected by\nthe Castle from now on.
3	ye1	So I'm thinking things over at the moment.\nWhat will I do with myself from now on?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420702.json
0	ye1	What a marvelous place this is!
1	ye1	The magnificent sweeping vistas aside,\nit's a joy to see people of the City and\nAgnus working arm in arm!
2	2	Glad to see you're getting on.
3	ye1	I admit the Agnians have been\nrather wary of my presence, but\nI can hardly blame them for that.
4	ye1	The City folk can be a boorish bunch,\nbut they've been far more accommodating\non the whole. I was pleasantly surprised!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420703.json
0	ye1	I'm so sorry about all the trouble\nI've caused for everyone.
1	ye1	I completely failed to read Luciona's\ntrue intentions...
2	ye1	I let you all down, thinking she was\nsuch a fine, upstanding comrade...
3	5	Aw, Ulrich, don't take it so personally.\nYou're a good lad.
4	ye1	...OK...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420704.json
0	ye1	Setting foot within the hallowed walls of\nthe City... It's like a dream coming true!
1	ye1	So many superannuated people, living\nboldly beyond their tenth term...
2	ye1	I suppose that this must be the true state\nof nature, when it isn't bound by the\nartificial systems of Moebius...
3	ye1	Will we be able to make this our\nway of life too, someday?
4	ye1	...Well, we're the ones who will determine\nthat, by our effort! I will do everything\nthat I can!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk420901.json
0	@e1	Queen's word, we're looking into\nthis ether cylinder fiasco with the\nutmost seriousness.
1	@e1	In fact, we're expecting a report\nfrom the inspector very soon.
2	@e1	I can assure you, there's absolutely\nnothing to worry about here.
3	5	You sure about that?
4	@e1	Ngh... Yes, perfectly sure!\nPlease, believe me!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk421001.json
0	_e1	We train elite officers, such as myself,\nhere at the Castle.
1	_e1	It takes more than muscle and legions\nof soldiers to win a war, you know.
2	_e1	You need officers with first-rate brains\ntoo, to really get soldiers moving properly.
3	5	...Hm.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk421002.json
0	_e1	I thought we might be able to come up\nwith a plan if we studied Ouroboros and\nMoebius's past battles.
1	_e1	Could you give us access to your records?\nWe really want to help you guys.
2	5	Uh... I don't think we've been\nkeeping anything like that, mate.
3	_e1	You haven't?!\nWhy the spark would you not?!
4	5	Look, we didn't exactly have the time\nto jot down notes in the heat of battle...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk421003.json
0	_e1	If I'm honest, I find a lot of the ninth-\nand tenth-termers kind of pathetic.
1	_e1	They just can't cope with the change\nthat Ouroboros bring to the world.
2	5	Hey, come on, don't say that...
3	_e1	If they can't hack it, they should\nbe weeded out. Simple as that.
4	_e1	Though...that's kind of the same\nas the old rules, I guess...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk421101.json
0	Wf1	Ugh...
1	3	What's up?
2	Wf1	We've been undergoing all this\ntraining to become officers of the\nGuard, or inspectors...
3	Wf1	But now that the Castle's Flame Clock's\nbeen broken, I don't know what we're\ngoing to do with our lives any more...
4	3	O-oh... I guess we might have\nsnuffed that up for you, huh...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk421102.json
0	Wf1	We do want a rematch, Ouroboros,\nbut you're going to have to wait a bit.
1	5	Sure. Hit us up any time.
2	Wf1	Can you give us three years?
3	5	What? No! We'll all be\npast our tenth terms!
4	Wf1	Hmm. So waiting until time runs out\nwon't do any good... Need a new plan.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk421103.json
0	Wf1	Have you been to the Tap-Dancing Nopon?
1	Wf1	The owner, Panina, sees it as her duty to\nnurture promising young people, and she\nalways serves huge portions.
2	5	Wh-?
3	5	...She's never done that for ME.
4	Wf1	Ha. Guess I'm just more\npromising than you.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk421201.json
0	Xf1	We're really quite fortunate.
1	Xf1	The Flame Clock is gone, but we have\nplenty of time to consider what kind of\nnew system we'll put in place instead.
2	Xf1	If we were in our tenth term already,\nwe'd just have to greet oblivion before\nwe could do anything to put it in order.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk421202.json
0	Xf1	The other colonies and the City are\nall rallying against Origin, right?
1	1	That's right, they are.
2	Xf1	There's no point in us joining you. We'd\njust slow you down out on the field.
3	Xf1	I have been talking it through with\nPharod and the rest, though. If there's\nsomething we can do, let us know.
4	1	It's nice of her, but she really\ndoesn't have to go that far...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk421203.json
0	Xf1	You managed to sort out all that trouble\nwith the ether mine, didn't you?
1	4	We did indeed.
2	Xf1	A lot of people probably think it was all\nwrapped up with Consuls and Moebius,\nbut I don't think it was.
3	Xf1	Can't help thinking this happened because\npeople had to walk away from what it\nwas that made their world go round.
4	Xf1	As soon as people start foisting\nresponsibility off on others then this'll\nhappen again, mark my words.

1	1	Actually, yes, but-
2	Yf1	Ohoho! Pity and shame! That flute\nnot craftponship of Giddygiddy, but\nstill of respectable quality!
3	Yf1	You see, Giddygiddy is craftypon of\nmusical instrument of off-seers.
4	Yf1	Repairs, anything to do with flute is\npurview of Giddygiddy! Any problems,\nyou know who to call!

0	Yf1	Oho! How is repair job Giddygiddy did on\nflute?
1	6	Seems like you did a really good job.
2	Yf1	That of much relief. It not every day\nGiddygiddy repair such sad-looking\ninstrument.
3	Yf1	Is why Giddygiddy want friends tell flute\nowner to show Giddygiddy flute regularly.\nIf not, stress make Giddygiddy lose fluff!

0	Zf1	Her Majesty has once again\ntaken a lot on her plate.
1	Zf1	Learning about the state of Aionios\nfrom visits to the City and the Castles\nmade quite the impression on her.
2	Zf1	She shows such a gracious interest\nin the troops at each colony, asking\nso many questions about them.
3	Zf1	Having had the privilege of being in her\npresence, it's clear to me that she without\na shadow of a doubt is our true Queen.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk421403.json
0	Zf1	Good Ouroboros... You may humbly\naddress the Queen, if you will.
1	G	Aizel... Your concern and formality\nis overdone, sometimes.

0	of1	All Colony 15 friends in City.
1	of1	Api here because Captain look sad.
2	N	Hah, it's not like feeling forlorn and lost at\nsea, matey. Away to the City with ye,\nyou feathered scallywag.
3	of1	Api must refuse. Api know Captain heart\nache with many sad feeling of despair.
4	N	Argh...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510102.json
0	of1	Api find work here really not\nso very bad at all!
1	of1	Busy much, but Michiba less\nlikely than Captain to issue\nflurry of silly requests.
2	of1	Yes, job here full of meaning,\nnot mere silly sausage wrapped\nin baguette of foolishness.
3	N	...Why you little broken bilge-mophead...!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510103.json
0	of1	When working here, lots of\nbiggipon such as Captain stop by.
1	of1	Common features with Captain are:\nwrinkly skin like old Armu elbow, talk\nconstantly of self, never listen to other...
2	of1	So many similarities! Captain sure to have\neasy time blending in with local culture.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510104.json
0	of1	On hearing story of Captain,\nwhole crew set sail right away.
1	of1	Maybe crew got tired and sick of Colony 15\nand want experience wider world.
2	of1	Or maybe crew left by way of going with\nflow, without the knowing why.
3	of1	Captain look down in dumps at current\nmoment. Api stay here for now to cheer\nspirit of lone matey.

0	pf1	Lhukavu asked me over here,\nand they've got me working.
1	pf1	But I'm bored outta my mind!
2	pf1	I mean, I get the whole, don't-work-don't-\nearn-don't-eat thing, really, I do.
3	pf1	It's just so boring without\nthe Cap'n though!
4	6	I'm starting to worry about you...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510203.json
0	pf1	Helping out with that Lost Numbers\nbusiness was the most refreshing\nthing I've done in forever!
1	pf1	Now I realize I'm just like the Cap'n!\nIt's like, if we're not out on the high\nseas, something's not right, y'know?
2	pf1	So that's why I've been catching\nfish in the Erythia Sea and selling\nthem to Michiba!
3	4	Seems like you're really making a\ncontribution to life in the City! More\nthan one might have imagined.
4	pf1	You really think so? ...Hey,\nwas that supposed to be a\ncompliment?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510301.json
0	qf1	This place here is nice.\nNot too dissimilar to a calm at sea.
1	qf1	The only weird thing is that occasionally,\nthe little ones like to follow me round.
2	3	The kids, you mean?
3	qf1	Yeah, them. I must be the talk of the\nCity, eh? Real popular, like.
4	3	Yeah, that's definitely not it.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510302.json
0	qf1	I really ought to say thanks again for\nwhat you did for me back there.
1	2	No worries. Have you had \nproblems since all that?
2	qf1	Nah, it's steady away, pretty much.\nShiner's a real promising pupil too.\nIt's a pleasure to teach him.
3	qf1	I hear there are even more kids looking\nfor instruction round here. That's pretty\nawesome news, right?
4	2	Glad to hear things are going well.\nLooks like you're settling into the\nCity nicely!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510303.json
0	qf1	I'm glad that the Captain's\ngot the freedom of the City\nnow. Makes things easier.
1	6	Well, I think it's down to your hard work,\nTorto. You, and the rest of Colony 15.
2	qf1	Well, I guess... Actually, I even\ngot a few props for teaching\nthe kids swordplay lately, too.
3	6	Yeah? That's awesome!
4	qf1	Well, it'll give the Captain a chuckle, at\nleast. He'd probably tell me I'm a few\nlifetimes too green to be a teacher!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510401.json
0	rf1	The Captain told us to go and\ndo whatever it is we want to do.
1	rf1	And I've been thinking of exploring\nthis place and seeing everything\nit's got to offer.
2	rf1	So, I guess first things first, I'll go try one\nof those Torpedo wraps.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510402.json
0	rf1	Thanks for what you did for Torto.
1	rf1	We've been thinking we ought to do\nsomething to give back to the City, too.
2	rf1	But, it's not going so well at the moment.\nThere are still quite a few people round\nhere who don't think so kindly of us.
3	5	Well, it's not like we got the warmest of\nwelcomes when we first got here, either.\nI guess these things take time.
4	rf1	Yeah, you're right. I guess we just need\nto try a bit of positive thinking for now.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510403.json
0	rf1	I've decided I'm going to stick\nwith Pergas in the Lost Numbers.
1	rf1	I've achieved what I wanted to do now.\nBut I think personality-wise, I'm at my\nhappiest when I'm on the battlefield.
2	rf1	Yeah, nothing beats getting out \nthere and keeping yourself on\nyour toes, for me.
3	5	Well, good for you. Glad you\nfound something that works\nfor you.

3	sf1	...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510502.json
0	sf1	...
1	6	Uhm...so...you think Torto's getting\nused to the City here, do you...?
2	6	But for you...it's taking longer...?
3	3	Well, don't stew about it.\nI'm sure you'll get there.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510503.json
0	sf1	...
1	5	What? You told something\nto Leeanne? Is that right?

0	tf1	This place is mad...
1	tf1	It's, like, way, way bigger and more\nspacious than the Colony 15 Ferronis.
2	tf1	I just know I'm gonna get my head in a\nspin trying to find my way round...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510602.json
0	tf1	What is this? Like a jailhouse\nor something?
1	1	What are you doing in a\nplace like this?
2	tf1	I didn't know the way, so I asked\nsome wrinkly old soul.
3	tf1	That's how I got here, anyway!\nDo you think they were messing with me?
4	3	Um. I wonder...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510603.json
0	4	Did you lose your way again?
1	tf1	Nope, not this time.\nI know exactly where I am!
2	tf1	When in doubt, I've been asking wrinklies\nthe way. And they're always kind enough\nto give me really specific directions!
3	6	Sounds like you're fitting right in!
4	3	But, dude - 'fess up.\nYou're lost.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510701.json
0	uf1	The City's got all sorts of dishes I've\nnever seen before in my life.
1	uf1	It's really motivated me to learn how\nthey're put together so I can make\nthem myself!
2	uf1	I'm gonna go find some place\nwhere they can put me to work!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510702.json
0	uf1	So they're letting me work at\nMichiba Canteen. Cool, huh?
1	uf1	Torto and the others have just been\ncausing headaches for the City, but Michiba\nwas good enough to take me on anyway.
2	uf1	I'm so thankful for her generosity!\nShe's got a real big heart.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510703.json
0	uf1	I have nothing but admiration\nand thanks for Michiba.
1	uf1	I was absent a bit ago...\nProbably caused her no\nend of bother.
2	uf1	But she's looked past that now.\nShe's teaching me to cook, really\nshowing me how it's done.
3	uf1	I hope I can master it properly\nand pay Michiba back for the\nkindness that she's shown me!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510801.json
0	vf1	I've never seen so many different people\nliving in one place. Colony 15 was way\nmore straightforward compared to here.
1	vf1	Everyone in Colony 15 was rough, wild,\nand out of control. That's not the case\nhere in the City, like, at all.
2	vf1	It's gonna be tough adjusting to the new\nstate of things, but Captain's orders are\nCaptain's orders, after all.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510802.json
0	vf1	I caught Boomer's performance in the park.
1	vf1	The off-seer's flute isn't the only thing\nthat can make sweet music, huh!
2	vf1	I had no idea about that, until then.
3	vf1	But it's a real source of fascination for me.\nI'm really glad I came to the City!
4	vf1	I mean, sure, maybe it wasn't\nall plain sailing, but still...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk510803.json
0	vf1	Vane got in contact with me.\nIt was quite the surprise.
1	vf1	The support that we gave to\nthe Lost Numbers must have\nreally done the trick, huh?
2	2	Well, I think you really got it across\nthat Colony 15 wants to contribute\nto the City, at least!
3	6	Yeah, you got them thinking of\nyou as friends now, I reckon.
4	vf1	Yeah, that's it. Things have eased up\nhere now, got a bit more comfortable.\nI'm starting to think we can make it here.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520101.json
0	xf1	Don't worry, I can take care of Colony Mu!
1	xf1	I don't really know what to do yet,\nbut I'm the only one who knows what\nreally happened.
2	xf1	I won't let Fiona do this all by herself.\nWe can shoulder what Irma left behind,\ntogether...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520102.json
0	xf1	Hey, Fiona. I may be a Tirkinhead...
1	xf1	But I'm going to think really hard and\nfind something to make you feel better,\nI promise!
2	O	I know... Thank you, Tallow.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520103.json
0	xf1	I think I know where we went\nwrong before. We didn't come up\nwith a proper plan.
1	xf1	I'm gonna come up with a real good one\nnext time! A good, uh, solid plan!
2	xf1	Since Irma's not here any more...\nI have to keep us well-prepared!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520104.json
0	xf1	So maybe we didn't actually\nfind the new lieutenant...
1	xf1	But Fiona's got herself out of the dumps,\nat least, and I'll support her 100%!
2	xf1	The actual sticker hunt really got people\nfired up, so yeah... I think we'll do OK!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520105.json
0	xf1	So Fiona wants to start over from\nscratch, huh...? She's so strong.
1	5	...You OK, mate? I know you've had it\npretty rough, too, looking after her.
2	xf1	I know, but still, I can't help thinking\nit could've gone better.
3	xf1	It kinda feels like I was trying to pass\nthe blame off on someone else...
4	xf1	But I'm also partly responsible, so I'm\ngonna do my best and help build our\nway up from scratch, too!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520106.json
0	xf1	While fighting against you, I thought, "Wow,\nreally Ouroboros are as amazing as they say!"
1	xf1	Um... If you don't mind me asking, what\nkind of training do you usually do...?
2	5	Well, we do stuff like lifting weights and-
3	6	Yeah, lifting weights!
4	xf1	Wow, that's brilliant!\nI'm gonna do that from now on, too!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520107.json
0	3	Seems like the conference is the talk\nof the colony right now. Good for you!
1	xf1	Heheh. It was tough, but rewarding.\nIt got me all hyped up listening to\neveryone talk, too!
2	xf1	Besides, I think it'll be super helpful to\nhave people to consult with right away\nwhen things go wrong!
3	xf1	I just don't want anyone left\nto struggle on their own.
4	5	...Yeah, exactly. I think the way\nyou're going, you can pull this off.

1	zf1	I...I don't want her to leave...
2	O	It'll be OK, Hildie. You have Tallow\nand Nico and everyone else with you.
3	zf1	Yeah, I guess...\nI'm sorry, I shouldn't be so selfish...
4	zf1	Just come back as soon\nas you can, OK...?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520302.json

1	5	Wow, that sounds awesome!
2	zf1	It *is* awesome! And it tastes even\nbetter with friends.
3	zf1	'Cause of what happened with Irma,\nI thought it might be nice to eat\nsomething together...
4	zf1	But...we can't have parties\nwith her any more...
5	1	...

2	zf1	What can I do to be more\nuseful to everyone...?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520304.json
0	zf1	What Fifi said made me so, so happy...!
1	zf1	But still, I don't think I'd be much\nuse to her, even if I became lieutenant...
2	zf1	What can I do to be more\nuseful to everyone...?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520305.json
0	zf1	You...all knew about Irma, didn't you?
1	3	Yeah... Sorry we didn't tell you.
2	zf1	No, it's OK. Thanks for not leaving Fifi\nto deal with this on her own... (sniff)
3	zf1	I'm sorry for being so clueless...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520306.json
0	zf1	That was the first time I've ever fought for\nthe colony...! My heart's still racing...
1	6	Sorry if we overdid it, Hildemarie...\nAre you hurt anywhere...?
2	zf1	No, I'm fine...! Everyone's fine!
3	zf1	Aya stopped looking so down...and even\nKana was a lot more chatty with us than\nshe usually is.
4	zf1	It's sad that we lost, but...I'm so, so happy\nthat I got to see everyone smiling and\nlaughing like that again.

0	@f1	That Consul was a real piece of work!\nIt still feels so surreal...
1	4	You seem a lot calmer than\nyour fellow companions.
2	@f1	That's 'cause Nico, by which I mean me, is\nfar more concerned about what we're gonna\neat from now on!
3	@f1	I know everyone's afraid about their\nmemories being all hazy, but what's\nworrying gonna do? What's gone is gone.
4	@f1	If there's no point thinking about it,\nkeep it out of mind, sez Nico!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520402.json
0	@f1	If you ever need anything, Fifi, just let Nico\nknow. Or literally anyone else if you want,\nbut, y'know, I'm here...
1	O	Thank you, Nico. You don't need\nto worry about me.
2	@f1	I believe you, Fifi...
3	@f1	...but I still can't help but be a tad\nworried...

0	@f1	The fishy party might have been really\nfun, but then Tallooloo ran his mouth.\nAny idea what's up with him...?
1	@f1	He sure made Aya pretty mad.\nIt wasn't fun to watch...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520404.json
0	@f1	We've got tons of preserved foodstuffs\nnow! That should be enough rations to\nlast us.

0	@f1	Irmy... That mudder...\nHow could she?
1	@f1	She went to all that trouble to\nleave us the key to her hideout,\nlike she meant for us to find it...
2	@f1	It's like she wanted us to understand...\nLike she wanted us to forgive her, maybe.\nLeaves a bad taste in Nico's, my, mouth...
3	4	It's not hard to imagine that she might\nhave been trying to atone by passing her\nMoebius records on to you.
4	@f1	You're a kind soul, Taion...\nNico's sorry, and I'm just talking about myself\nhere, but I just can't see it that way.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520406.json
0	@f1	Lotey is so enthusiastic! She's definitely\nthe most chipper of the group.
1	@f1	Maybe it's 'cause we've been blessed with\nthese new lives, so now she feels like she\nhas to give it everything she's got.
2	@f1	Though...it's kinda strange, if you ask Nico.\nAnd you're talking to her, so, you know.\nOne assumes.
3	@f1	We've always been faced with\nlife and death...but it feels far\nmore important this time.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520407.json
0	@f1	Heh heh heh! We only went\nand found a ship already!
1	5	Seriously?! That was fast!
2	@f1	Someone left it behind some rocks by the\nshore. It probably got wrecked in a battle\nand abandoned there by some colony!
3	@f1	We don't have many mechanics\nleft these days, so it's anyone's guess\nhow we're gonna fix it, but...
4	@f1	...it's too soon to give up now! We've got\nKana, and some other people good with\nmachines. We'll figure something out!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520408.json
0	5	Hey, Nico. Is that a skip in your step I see?
1	@f1	Heh heh heh. Team Nico's work is\ngoing swimmingly!
2	@f1	Lotey's food is getting even yummier, and\nTussie's ranch is thriving!
3	@f1	But you know the biggest change of all?\nHildie! She's becoming more like Fifi every\nday. Her eyes sparkle with enthusiasm.
4	@f1	Also, Nico's quite a dab hand with supplies\nnow. She, I mean I, even got promoted to\nsquad leader! Nico feels unstoppable now!

0	_f1	We've got the Castle not far north, and\nErythia Relay Base to the southeast...
1	_f1	We've had nothing to worry about\nuntil now, but the Agnians aren't our\nallies any more, so...
2	6	...Is that what's worrying you?
3	_f1	A little, yes. I can't really relax,\nknowing that...

1	_f1	Our soldiers were shattered from fighting,\nso Tallow set up his own squad to help\nother squads that were short-handed.
2	_f1	The members ended up being just\nShu and me, but we always followed\nhis lead whenever he needed us.
3	_f1	I'm not sure about this time, though...

0	_f1	I always thought that Irma and I were\nalike in some ways.
1	_f1	We both thought that less is more,\nand kept our distance from others...
2	_f1	Even knowing the truth now, I don't\nthink everything about her was a lie.\nNo one's *that* slick.
3	_f1	I think that's why she set this all up, to\nreveal her true colors to us in the end...

1	_f1	Since we don't have to fight any more, we\nhaven't really needed it as much, though...
2	_f1	Everyone's emotions have been all over\nthe place, wondering if we could ever\nreturn to how things once were...
3	_f1	When we made the circle together\nagain, it reminded me that all we\ncan do is start over.
4	_f1	It felt like a new promise, to make this\ncolony a better place.

1	_f1	Just you wait, today is only the beginning.\nTallow seems full of beans, and even\nMikaela has been helping out recently.
2	_f1	She's really changed, you know. I was\nworried about her, since she's so easily\nswept up in things, good or bad, but...
3	_f1	...it looks like she's overcome her fears.\nHehe... It's quite inspiring.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520601.json
0	Wg1	Just leave it to me while Fiona's away!\nWe can handle ourselves just fine.
1	Wg1	But do keep a close eye on Fiona\nwhile you're out there.
2	Wg1	The great thing about her is how\nshe can power up herself and everyone\naround her in the same way.
3	Wg1	If you keep her next to Defenders,\nyou should have an ironclad defense.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520602.json
0	Wg1	What happened to cooperating? I'll be\nblunt - it was never like this before.
1	Wg1	I wonder what I'd do if this were a battle...\nI know what everyone's thinking, but still...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520603.json
0	Wg1	I wonder why I can't handle things as\nwell as Irma did...
1	5	Because you're not Irma, duh. You have to\nfind your own way of doing things.
2	Wg1	If I knew what that was, I would've done it\nages ago! I'll be blunt with you: what Fiona\nneeds is Irma, not a lieutenant.
3	Wg1	I can't just take her place.\nI know that well enough.
4	Wg1	But Irma's not here any more...so we have\nto support Fiona as best as we can.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520604.json
0	Wg1	I just can't believe it... Our Irma...
1	5	...It stings knowing your friend\nbetrayed you, huh...?
2	Wg1	It does...but Fiona and Tallow\nmust have it far worse.
3	Wg1	I wonder how it felt to lead us with that\nknowledge weighing them down, or how\nlong they tortured themselves over it...
4	Wg1	I blame myself even more than Irma,\nfor hurting my closest friends with my\nwillful ignorance...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520605.json
0	Wg1	Thanks for training with us! Really sucks\nthat we lost to you lot, though.
1	Wg1	It's been ages since I've felt that in sync\nwith the others.
2	Wg1	I'll be kicking your arses next time, though!\nGet ready for round two!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520606.json
0	Wg1	No matter how well we get along, we\nall have our own thoughts and opinions.
1	Wg1	Now we're all on the same page\nabout that, I hope we can chat with\neach other a lot more!
2	Wg1	Thanks for your help, Mio!
3	2	Hehe. It's my pleasure.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520701.json
0	Xg1	That Irma was such a liar...!\nShe said she'd survive alongside us...
1	Xg1	(sniff) That means...I'll have to\ndeal with the pirates alone...
2	1	The pirates...?
3	Xg1	Yeah... Apparently they show up east\nof Daedal Isle sometimes. That's what\nIrma used to tell me...
4	Xg1	She said we have to stay on guard...\nbut now she's... (sniff)
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520702.json
0	Xg1	I haven't heard much about\npirates recently! I wonder...
1	Xg1	Maybe somebody got rid of them?!\nI'll feel so much better if they have!
2	3	Ha ha ha... Who knows, eh...?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520703.json
0	Xg1	I know Fifi said she'd do her best, but is\nshe really gonna be OK...?
1	Xg1	Also, if everything's resting on her, what\nwould happen if she was gone one day...?
2	5	I catch your drift, but what's the\nuse in stressing about something\nthat's not even happening?
3	Xg1	Oh, hm...! I s'pose you're right...
4	Xg1	But for some reason, I feel even more\non edge than when we still had to fight...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520704.json
0	Xg1	Irma really loved to keep things tidy.
1	Xg1	She always told us off if we left out\nused equipment and stuff...
2	Xg1	So when I saw how tidy her\nsecret hideout was...
3	Xg1	...all I could think about was how much\nit reminded me of her... (sniffle)
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520705.json
0	Xg1	Oh, hey, Taion!
1	Xg1	Thank you ever so much\nfor the pitfall trap idea.
2	Xg1	Using it to weaken the opponent's strength\nbefore they even reach the gate... It just\nmakes so much sense!
3	4	...Actually, that was Lanz's idea, but if that\nfact doesn't do anything to dissuade you,\nthen absolutely, be my guest.
4	Xg1	Thank you! I totally will!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520706.json
0	Xg1	I realized something after talking to Mio on\nthe ship. I do get along with Aya, but...
1	Xg1	...that might be 'cause it's easier to be with\nher, 'cause she decides everything for me.
2	5	Hanging with someone because it's easy\nisn't the same thing as actually enjoying\nyourself, right?
3	Xg1	Exactly... So I'm gonna try expanding my\nhorizons and talking with more people, not\njust Aya!
4	Xg1	I can't go on being unaware of my friends'\nfeelings when they're struggling...!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520801.json
0	Yg1	So...the Consul was tricking us all along.
1	Yg1	Sean and Frost perished, too...\nAll because of her...
2	5	I sympathize with you, mate,\nbut it's not over yet. The colony\nstill needs you. Don't forget that.
3	Yg1	...Of course. You're right.\nWe rose up again so that we don't\nhave to lose anything or anyone else...
4	Yg1	I'll get back to work. I can't keep moping\naround forever, or they'll just end up\nteasing me.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520802.json
0	Yg1	The stickers were my idea, but Tallow's\nthe one who said he wanted to plan how\nto get everyone on board with it.
1	Yg1	He's a good guy. Sure, he's not perfect,\nand he makes mistakes...but he goes all in\nif it's to help others.
2	Yg1	Please don't misunderstand his intentions.\nIt's not his fault. His head just isn't\nscrewed on properly.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520803.json
0	Yg1	Irma... Why would you do this...?
1	O	That's what I want to know, too.\nThat's why I decided to travel with\nour new Ouroboros friends.
2	O	Irma was never the type to delight in\nothers' suffering... I'm sure Moebius has\nsome answers for us.
3	Yg1	...Kanata said the same thing. I don't\nthink I've processed my feelings yet...
4	Yg1	I'm going to check out the hideout a little\nmore on my own. There's no way I can\njust ignore this and move on...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520804.json
0	Yg1	Nico called my idea cool, but\nshe's pretty formidable herself.
1	Yg1	It's all thanks to her that we could get\nthe huge amount of materials we needed\nto actually start fixing the gate.
2	Yg1	It wasn't an amount you could get quickly,\neither. She must have been stockpiling it\nlittle by little for a good while...
3	Yg1	But I'm the one everyone's always calling\na schemer... It's a bit hard to swallow.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520805.json
0	Yg1	I found some information about the Consuls\nwhile digging around in Irma's hideout.
1	4	Oh, really? What did it say?
2	Yg1	According to the data, there are 26 people\naltogether, but T's name was crossed out.
3	Yg1	Next to it was a scribble that said\n"stupidhead".
4	5	...Wow... I know exactly how she felt...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520901.json
0	Zg1	Hey, um! Thank you so much for\ndestroying the Flame Clock...!
1	Zg1	I think it took a lot of pressure\noff of Kanata, in particular.
2	3	Kanata was worried? Huh.\nShe seems so calm and collected.
3	Zg1	...Well, Defenders usually don't live that\nlong, given the nature of their role...
4	Zg1	But now I can wave her off and say "see\nyou later" without seeming dishonest. You\ndon't know how happy that makes me!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520902.json
0	Zg1	Wowww, we caught sooo many fish! I\ncan't wait for the party!
1	6	There's so much fish to go around.\nNobody's going hungry tonight!
2	Zg1	Hooray! My stomach is a bottomless pit\nwhen it comes to Lotus's cooking!
3	Zg1	...Seems like not everyone's in the party\nspirit, though. Usually things are a little\nmore upbeat around here...
4	Zg1	It feels like everyone's slowly losing heart\nthese days, for some reason...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520903.json
0	Zg1	I'm slow on my feet, so I'm often left\nwatching everyone from behind...
1	Zg1	Nobody seems to be having much fun\nthese days, from what I can see...
2	2	Ayase also said that people don't seem to\ncooperate these days... I wonder if you two\naren't the only ones who feel that way.
3	Zg1	Goo even asked me if there's been a fight!\nIt feels like everyone's shuffling off to their\nown little corners...
4	Zg1	I love watching everybody get along, so\nthis tense mood in the colony right now\nis...kinda suffocating!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk520904.json
0	Zg1	Well done, everyone! Hm?\nIs something wrong?
1	6	Sorry... We were just worried about you,\nbut actually you seem pretty fine.
2	Zg1	Oh, nothing to apologize for! It's Nico\nyou should be worried about. I spied\nher crying a lot earlier...
3	Zg1	Everyone seems to be in shock.\nI wanna show up for them, let them\nknow that I'm by their side.
4	Zg1	I wanna show how grateful I am to\neveryone for still being here, with me!

1	bg1	Irma, though... She would always try to\nchange the subject, never really telling us\nwhat she really thought.
2	bg1	She did seem to have some deep\nconversations with Goo sometimes...\nMaybe because Goo's so forgetful.
3	bg1	Maybe if we'd just spoken a bit more...\nthis all could've been avoided... But then\nagain, maybe not.

1	nj1	I doubt we can be of much help there,\nbut we'll do what we can to support you.
2	nj1	Here... Take this.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk540401.json
0	oj1	We swore to get as far away\nas possible from battle.
1	oj1	The closer you are, the greater the\nchance of them sniffing you out and\ndragging you in.
2	oj1	But if you avoid going out and keep\na low profile, you get to stay well\nout of harm's way.
3	oj1	...But all that's about\nto change, isn't it?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk540402.json
0	oj1	Seems you lot knew what was\ngoing on with Nimue.
1	4	...
2	oj1	Actually, you don't have to tell me. We're\nalready oblivious to the outside world.\nOne thing more won't make a difference.
3	oj1	I was just curious. I thought\nshe'd never left this place...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk540403.json
0	oj1	I've been talking to our leader.
1	oj1	We're wondering if it's all right for us\nto take a peek at the outside world.
2	oj1	Even the slightest little sliver of info\ncould help to keep our land safe.
3	oj1	I think when the time is right, we'll act.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610101.json
0	jW1	Everything will turn out just fine\nif we just abide by m'lady.
1	5	Huh. You think that attitude's\ngonna get you through?
2	jW1	I don't expect you to understand, but\nthere's a world of difference between\nm'lady and your average grunt.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610102.json
0	jW1	You've got some tremendous power\nlocked away in there, haven't you?
1	jW1	I wouldn't try using it while on prison duty,\nthough. The guards are sure to find out!
2	6	Yeah, we know.\nNo Interlinking, right?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610103.json
0	jW1	What an excellent plan!\nM'lady really is something else.
1	jW1	We will make this happen,\ncome sparks or high water!
2	4	Hmm...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610104.json
0	1	So you'll be staying here then?
1	jW1	We're attached to the Agnian forces\nby order of the City.
2	jW1	Whatever m'lady needs from us, Oggy\nand I will deliver! We are her rock!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610105.json
0	jW1	Anton was a good guy. I'd hoped we'd be\ngoing back to the City together.
1	jW1	Aggy, Oggy, Anton... We were gonna be\nthe three loyal supporters of m'lady. That\nwas the big plan.
2	6	Hey, I'm sorry... I just don't know what to\nsay to that...
3	jW1	No, really, it's fine. What happened wasn't\nyour fault.
4	jW1	Just understanding how he felt...\nIt would have made Anton happy.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610106.json
0	jW1	What we need here is some decent food!\nDon't you know you can't fight on an\nempty stomach?
1	5	I mean, you're not wrong...
2	jW1	Right? So we've gotta get a massive supply\nof food to the City!
3	5	I wonder...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610107.json
0	jW1	Seeker's really peeved with me...
1	3	Yeah? Go on, tell me what you did.
2	jW1	He was going on about how there's so\nmuch to read in the City, so much to learn...
3	jW1	So he gave me an earful about how\nI've been wasting my time playing around!
4	3	Well, maybe you should listen...\nLess leisure, more knuckling down.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610201.json
0	kW1	Do you know the reason\nwhy m'lady is here?
1	1	...
2	kW1	I don't know myself. But she must\nhave something important in mind.
3	kW1	Aggy and I fight only according to\nm'lady's wise commands, on a strictly\nneed-to-know basis!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610202.json
0	kW1	Ah, what I wouldn't give for a\ntaste of the City's cuisine...
1	kW1	Don't go getting the wrong end of the\nstick, mind! I have no regrets about\nfollowing m'lady. None at all!
2	kW1	It's just...every now and again I think\nof the food in the City and get such a\nrush of nostalgia...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610203.json
0	3	So you guys have it hard\nfollowing Ghondor too, huh?
1	kW1	Protecting m'lady from harm is our\nsolemn duty. Whatever comes her way!
2	4	That's some dedication.
3	kW1	Yes! If I traded my life as token for\nm'lady's safety, I'd be happy to have\ngotten a good deal!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610204.json
0	2	How are you? Doing OK?
1	kW1	Oh, it's you!\nYes, yes, not too bad at all.
2	kW1	There are some hotheads among the\nAgnians, and some that are giving us\na hard time, though.
3	kW1	It's all a bit daunting. We'll have\nour work cut out for us.
4	kW1	Anyway, I needn't worry too much. I'm\nsure m'lady'll fix everything in no time!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610205.json
0	kW1	I made a proposal to get control over\nthe eastern island, but it got shot down.
1	1	What, you mean...
2	kW1	M'lady and Seeker told us not to do it,\nso we can hardly launch a rogue mission\nnow.
3	kW1	M'lady's having a really hard time at the\nmoment. I'm gutted that we can't offer her\nmuch support right now.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610206.json
0	5	Got chewed out, did you?
1	kW1	Hahaha! Yeah, I got a right earful!
2	5	You don't seem all that affected by it,\nmind. Looks like you laughed it right off!
3	kW1	Why, naturally! If it doesn't come\nfrom m'lady, it hardly even makes\nan impression! Hahaha!
4	4	You have a very straightforward\npersonality. Not that I'm making\nany judgments.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610301.json
0	rj1	If we're going to survive, we'll\nneed to count on the strength\nof the Lost Numbers.
1	rj1	Yes, we'll need to ally with them.\nAnd then...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610302.json
0	rj1	It seems that Lost Numbers were safely\nescorted into the City.
1	rj1	It's for the best. The Castle was pretty\nmuch teeming with Lost Numbers.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610303.json
0	rj1	I hear from Aggy that things aren't going\nwell in the City right now.
1	1	Did you have any ideas to help them out?
2	rj1	We were thinking we'd send non-food\nsupplies, but...
3	rj1	But Aggy seems pretty adamant that food\nsupplies are exactly what they'll want.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610304.json
0	1	Seeker... Probably no point\nin me saying not to feel sad...
1	rj1	Thanks to our little internal squabbles,\nthe Lost Numbers suffered a tragic loss.
2	rj1	The relationship that we were trying to\nbuild with the City... Well, we can forget\nabout that now.
3	rj1	At best, we're back to square one.\nAnd it's all thanks to our own stupidity.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610305.json
0	rj1	I'm still feeling worked up and excited...
1	rj1	We got to visit the City. That's a rare\nexperience for many.
2	1	It certainly is.\nIn fact, I still can't believe it myself.
3	rj1	Just imagine the possibilities if we could\nincrease cooperation and get to know the\nCity better...
4	rj1	I really believe that we can work towards\na relationship with the City that's vastly\ncloser than it is right now.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610401.json
0	sj1	(sigh)
1	4	Is something the matter?
2	sj1	The Queen that we'd believed in, followed\nall this time... She was an imposter. *And*\nwe've lost the Flame Clock.
3	sj1	What do we even do\nwith our lives now?
4	sj1	Sorry. That's the not the kind of thing\nI should just blurt out at you like that.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610402.json
0	sj1	Thanks to all of you for your help.
1	sj1	The Lost Numbers got back to the City in\none piece. That's a great relief.
2	5	Don't you think it was all down to your\nhard work though? All we did was\ngive it a last little push.
3	sj1	In any case, thank you!\nThings aren't quite settled yet, though.
4	sj1	There are still quite a few people who're\nstruggling to accept the situation. So we've\nprobably still got more work to do there...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610403.json
0	sj1	Hey, is the population of the City\nreally so big?
1	2	Hmmm... I wonder.
2	sj1	We've been ordered to send a massive\namount of food, so I daresay the\npopulation is greater than in Agnus.
3	sj1	I know these supplies are important\nfor our friendship, but they're our\nlifeline, too...
4	6	Yeah... I get you.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610404.json
0	sj1	It seems that it wasn't food supplies\nthat the City really wanted, huh?
1	1	Yeah... It looks that way.
2	sj1	It was weapons and Levnis materials that\nthey were really after. I guess that's a bit\nof a snag.
3	sj1	We're in a desperate spot as well.\nIf communications are blocked, then\nproblems are bound to arise.
4	sj1	I won't name names, but it'd be really\ngood if whoever's in charge could\nget their head in the game.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610405.json
0	sj1	Organizing the troops is going to take some\ntime. Would you mind going on ahead to\nthe port?
1	sj1	...Things are what they are, I guess.
2	sj1	...But it looks like there are still people in\nKeves who are struggling to adapt to it.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610501.json
0	tj1	They used to tell us this Castle\nwas impregnable.
1	tj1	We ruled the skies, so we knew Keves\ncould never come at us from above.
2	tj1	We really believed we were invincible.
3	tj1	But we were wrong. We lost it all,\nand in a totally unexpected way.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610502.json
0	tj1	If you're heading for the Aetia region,\nyou'll need to go out through the\nwest gate and stay on that road.
1	tj1	It's safe there.\nNo Keves colonies, you see!
2	tj1	That is, assuming our info is up to date.\nWe have been a little busy with Moebius...
3	tj1	Anyway, just be careful!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610503.json
0	1	How are people in the Castle\ndoing right now?
1	tj1	They're in good spirits, actually.\nMostly they're preparing for the\nfinal battle, repairing the Castle...
2	tj1	The Lost Numbers have been\nlending us a hand as well.
3	tj1	That's something we could never have\ndreamed, not long ago. I'll admit, I'm\npleased things are like this.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610504.json
0	tj1	I heard Ragzy attacked the\nLost Numbers' boat.
1	6	Yeah... And Dana...
2	tj1	We put in all that work to build\na relationship of trust, too.
3	tj1	We must have earned the ire of\nthe City dwellers now.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610505.json
0	tj1	Communication with the City is\ngoing pretty well now, isn't it?
1	5	Yeah. Seeker did a really good job,\ndidn't he?
2	tj1	If we can deepen the cooperation,\nmaybe we can even learn some of\nthat sweet City tech.
3	tj1	Yes, I'm looking forward to it now.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610601.json
0	uj1	We were all looking forward to you lot\ngetting the chop. But you still found time\nto get up in other people's business, huh?
1	3	Excuse me? You ungrateful little mudder...
2	uj1	Ah, c'mon, I was just having a laugh.\nGimme a break. My head's a mess!
3	uj1	Being liberated doesn't mean everything's\nsuddenly sunshine and roses, you know!
4	uj1	Cleaning out the plaza is a good\nopportunity for a bit of mental hygiene!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610602.json
0	uj1	Since I got assigned to the inspection\nbranch, I've had the chance to see a\nlot of colonies.
1	uj1	We've been taking a hard line against rule\nviolations and impropriety, making sure that\neach colony abides by the Castle's will.
2	uj1	I've always thought of it as a job\nthat's really worth doing, you know?\nMeaningful.
3	uj1	The activities of all departments are on\nhold right now, though. Can't really put\nmy talents to good use.
4	uj1	Looks like I'm going to have to\nreconsider the meaning of life...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610603.json
0	uj1	I really get the feeling that the\natmosphere in the Castle has changed.
1	2	Changed how, exactly?
2	uj1	It's as if everyone has just turned towards\nthe future a little bit more. Accepted\nreality, the way things really are.
3	6	Well, that's good then, right?\nIf everyone's more forward-looking.
4	uj1	I'd say so... I don't know how things will\nturn out from here on out, though.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610604.json
0	uj1	Ah, I give up.
1	5	What's up? Why the long face?
2	uj1	Ah, when I don't have any inspection\nbranch duties, I just feel myself at\nsuch a loose end.
3	uj1	Seeker gives me scraps of work here and\nthere... But it doesn't really cut it.
4	uj1	With nothing to do, I can get pretty down\nin the dumps. I stress out about a Consul\ngiving me the chop or something.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610605.json
0	uj1	Things have really changed around\nhere since you lot showed up.
1	1	Do you mean...a change for the better?
2	uj1	Naturally! Now we live in friendship with\neach other, all of us.
3	uj1	Now the Lost Numbers and Keves are our\nfriends. You were the ones that taught us\nhow to do that!
4	uj1	Just tell us what you want us to do!\nWhatever it is, we'll help you achieve it!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610606.json
0	uj1	Man, this just can't be happening...
1	uj1	The port has been occupied by that\nKevesi mob!
2	uj1	But for now, the port is all they've got.\nYou lot could take it back, surely?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610701.json
0	vj1	We'd got into the habit of thinking\nof the inmates as a workforce.
1	vj1	That's how we were conditioned to think,\nso we never questioned it. Bit depressing\nwhen you look back on it.
2	4	That certainly sounds like the\nmachinations of a Consul. You mustn't\nblame yourself for the way things were.
3	vj1	Yeah, you're right. It wasn't really\nour fault, when you think about it.
4	3	I dunno, I think it's good to reflect\non your actions a little...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610702.json
0	vj1	Who'd have thought we'd all be so\nbusy after being liberated, huh?
1	vj1	I guess we'll have to put off\ndealing with the warden's lot\nin the camp till later.
2	vj1	It's probably for the best if you\nstayed away from the camp for\nthe time being.
3	vj1	If you go, it'll probably cause a real fuss.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610703.json
0	vj1	Ah, I'm totally worn out...\nAnd, I want to say thanks for taking\ncare of that trio back there.
1	2	Ah, no, it's fine. We made a free choice to\nget involved with that.
2	vj1	OK. Well, when you see Seeker, can you\ntell him to stop dishing out so many of\nthese brutal tasks?
3	2	Huh...uhm... S-sure, I'll try to find some\nway to get that across tactfully.
4	vj1	Sometimes I think that Seeker belongs to\nsome whole other species that just loves\ntedious work.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610704.json
0	vj1	The prison warden's been left behind by all\nthese changes. He's kind of pitiable, don't\nyou think?
1	vj1	He's just crawled back up inside his shell,\nwithout changing up his ideas about the\nLost Numbers.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610705.json
0	vj1	Hey, do you guys have any\nof those novel things?
1	2	Uhm... No. I don't think we have any?
2	vj1	Seeker got hold of some in the City!\nI've been giving them a read.
3	vj1	They're just so interesting that I can't\neven concentrate on my work. It's actually\ngetting dicey. They'll be the ruin of me!
4	3	Eh, don't worry about that, sunshine!\nWeren't much hope for you to begin with.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610801.json
0	wj1	I really thought I'd have ended up on the\nrubbish heap long before my Homecoming.
1	wj1	Sometimes it's good to stay quiet, huh?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610802.json
0	wj1	Ragzy was a real idiot.\nIt was a bit of a problem, even.
1	1	...Were you friends?
2	wj1	Friends...? Huh, tricky.\nBut we certainly used\nto be idiots together.
3	wj1	I've lost track of him in the time\nthat I've spent in the slammer.
4	wj1	He was totally in awe of the Consuls...\nAnd now he's given them everything.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610803.json
0	wj1	Keves and the City are working\ntogether now.
1	wj1	Think that means I'll get to ride in a\nGastrates sometime?
2	4	I don't know about that. Letting you\non one might count as a health hazard.\nFor us.
3	wj1	Nah, c'mon, it'll be fine. I'm a first-rate\nLevnis pilot.
4	wj1	I'll look forward to it then! Getting\nmy pedal to metal and going nuts!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610901.json
0	xj1	You spend a bunch of years in\nthe clink and when you come out\nthe whole world's changed.
1	xj1	No more Consul any more,\nthe Queen's gone...
2	xj1	It's like I don't even know what's\ngoing on any more!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk610902.json
0	xj1	I'm lending a hand with logistics now.
1	3	OK. Well, no running wild, got it?
2	xj1	Hahaha! No way! That's no way\nto waste my freedom.
3	xj1	I'll have my hands full from here on in.\nSo I'll just put everything I've got into\nturning over a new leaf!
4	xj1	I've just gotta try to make myself useful\nto serious folks like Kaye.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611001.json
0	yj1	Ah, such a great feeling to be rid of that\nrotten Consul!
1	yj1	The Lost Numbers have been\nbringing me up to speed. So this\nis what it means to be "free", eh?
2	yj1	Heh... I could get used to this!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611002.json
0	yj1	We're gonna need intel if we're going\nto work with the Lost Numbers and Keves.
1	4	Yes... I'm of precisely the same mind.\nIntel is vital to assuming a supreme\nposition in battle.
2	yj1	I can see you know all about\nthis stuff, huh?
3	yj1	I'll need to get back to intel, see if we can\nget our hands on some fresher news.
4	yj1	I can already guess what Grover's going to\nsay, mind you! Hahaha!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611301.json
0	_j1	Your cell's not this way. You better\nget back before the guards start giving\nus all earache.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611302.json
0	_j1	All the guards here are young and\ngreen. And in a few years they'll be\ngone, replaced with new ones.
1	_j1	To think, we're locked up here in prison,\nbut we're gonna live longer than that lot.\nIt's a funny old thing...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611303.json
0	_j1	The guards we have here remind me of\nthe conservative faction in the City.
1	_j1	They spend the whole time shut up\nin a safe place, just taking care of\nwhatever's laid out in front of them.
2	_j1	They've never even seen\nwhat real life has to offer...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611304.json
0	_j1	We've no shortage of grudges to nurse\nagainst the Agnian forces.
1	_j1	But I still agree with what Ghondor put\nforward. We need to let go of grudges and\nmake allies of them.
2	_j1	That's why I think I'm gonna stay here,\nand do what needs to be done.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611401.json
0	Wk1	Come on, get to the central cell block\nfor morning assembly! You can't be late,\nor you'll wind up in a punishment cell.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611402.json
0	Wk1	When monster-culling duty rolls around,\nGhondor's crew really come through for us.
1	Wk1	Folks in here start to settle into\ntheir natural roles after a time.
2	6	Everyone helps each other out here, then.
3	Wk1	Yeah. The people you're locked up with\nturn into a sort of family, eventually.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611403.json
0	Wk1	Dying before your grandma... That's rough.\nIt's not supposed to happen like that.
1	Wk1	But I chose to live as a member of the\nLost Numbers, for the City. So I'll be\ndamned if I don't fulfill my duty.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611404.json
0	Wk1	Going back to the City, and in one piece\ntoo! I can hardly believe it.
1	Wk1	Grandma was overjoyed to see me back.\nShe was so happy she even did a little\nNopon dance - and she's no spring Tirkin!
2	Wk1	(sob) Yes, home's a wonderful thing.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611405.json
0	Wk1	I went ahead and undertook a survey\ninto the upper reaches of the Great Sword,\nwhere the City used to be.
1	Wk1	When I was there, I saw these\nbeautiful feathers on the ground.\nI'd never seen anything like them.
2	Wk1	I couldn't really make it out properly,\nbut the place must've been home to\nsome super-rare monster.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611501.json
0	Xk1	They've really pulled the wool over\nthese Agnian guards' eyes.
1	Xk1	Plenty of my comrades have been telling\nthem that Moebius are pulling the strings,\nbut they won't believe a word of it.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611502.json
0	Xk1	So the guards like to see us suffering.\nThat's when you know they've really\ngone bad.
1	Xk1	I wouldn't be surprised if the fake Queen\nof Agnus took pleasure in that too.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611503.json
0	Xk1	The prisoners who don't escape\nwill probably be executed on the\nday of the eclipse.
1	Xk1	So you've got to make sure that\nyou and Ghondor make it, OK?
2	4	Then your escape is no less valid.
3	Xk1	I just...don't know if I have the strength.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611504.json
0	Xk1	Back after a five-year stretch... It feels like\nsome distance has opened up between me\nand this place. Not with my family though.
1	Xk1	Since I stopped with the Lost Numbers\nstuff, everyone's started to heap concern\non me.
2	Xk1	Now, Caulte's not like me.\nShe went back to the Lost Numbers.\nWell, hope it's working out for her...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611505.json
0	Xk1	Are you going to Origin? I hope you'll give\nthem a good drubbing from me when you\nget there. Easier said than done though!

0	Yk1	The guards know we wouldn't stand\nfor it if they laid a hand on Ghondor,\nso they turn a blind eye to most stuff.
1	Yk1	Things have definitely gotten livelier\nround here since Ghondor arrived.
2	Yk1	We've got the daughter of the Elder with\nus now. And that gives us all some hope.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611603.json
0	Yk1	I wasn't much of a fighter to begin with,\nto tell you the truth.
1	Yk1	But everyone around me was applying to\njoin the Lost Numbers. I just got swept up\nin that and wound up as a fighter.
2	Yk1	But when push comes to shove, I'll show\nyou all what I can do. Because hey, look,\nI've got ten years front line experience now.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611604.json
0	Yk1	At last, it's the big push... You lot and\nGhondor are going to bust out of here,\nI'll make sure of that.

2	Yk1	Yeah, I won't, don't worry.
3	Yk1	First thing I'll be doing when I get to the\nCity is paying a visit to Michiba Canteen to\nchow down on some of that good grub...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611701.json
0	Zk1	I'm sorry. There's so much on my\nplate right now, I can't really afford\nto help you guys out.
1	3	Sure thing. Could you spare us\na few tips, at the very least?
2	Zk1	Yeah, maybe. There's a Nopon trader who\ngot mixed up with the gen pop here.
3	Zk1	If there's anything you need, that\nmight be a way to get ahold of it.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611702.json
0	Zk1	I love gathering days. It's a chance for\nme to go off into my own little world and\nthink about my favorite books all day.
1	Zk1	Ahh, what I wouldn't give for some\nof Leeanne's works...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611703.json
0	Zk1	After spending so long cooped up in a\njail cell, you start to forget why you even\njoined the Lost Numbers in the first place.
1	2	What made you become a soldier, then?
2	Zk1	Why, to get a bit closer to our\nbeloved Founders, of course!
3	Zk1	I was really hoping I'd get a shot at\nthe Ouroboros candidate exam, too...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611704.json
0	Zk1	I got the chance to stop by Wellwell's\nplace and read something again.
1	Zk1	The latest volume of the Founders'\nTale, it... It's just incredible! It moved\nme to tears right there and then.
2	Zk1	I never thought I'd be able to read the\nnext part of that story. Ah, the emotion!\nYeah, it's good to be alive sometimes!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611705.json
0	Zk1	Y'know, I'd been longing to get\nout there and see some action.
1	Zk1	But Monica asked me to stay behind in\nthe City and make sure everyone's safe.
2	Zk1	She's been so kind to me, so I feel\nlike I owe her that much.

0	ak1	Ten long years I spent in this prison\ncamp. That's a humdinger of a stretch.
1	ak1	It's probably about time they\npicked me out for the chop.
2	4	What makes you think that?
3	ak1	My age. You don't see many\nold prisoners in here, do you?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611802.json
0	ak1	An old squadmate told me once\nthat this territory used to belong to\nthe City, way back when.
1	ak1	It was a fertile place which produced a lot\nof crops. "Hope's Rest", they used to call it.
2	ak1	And they still call it the same thing in\nhere. It'd be funny if it wasn't so sad.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611803.json
0	ak1	I thought I was destined to\nlive and die in this place.
1	ak1	But in the end I've been blessed with\nthe chance to gamble my life fighting\nas a Lost Number.
2	ak1	It's a matter of guts now. I'll support\nyou with all I have. That'll be my way\nof repaying my fallen comrades!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611804.json
0	ak1	It's been ten whole years, and now\nhere I am, back in the City... It's so\ndifferent from how it used to be.
1	ak1	Guernica, hero of the City, is dead and\ngone... I finally got to hear about that,\njust lately.
2	ak1	Now my parents are dead, and most of\nmy friends have passed on too.
3	ak1	So what's my aim in life now? What's\nleft for me to swing my Blade at?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611805.json
0	ak1	Hey, I need to tell you something.\nRiggie and I decided to get married!
1	1	Really? Congratulations! I'd no idea\nyou and Riggie were so close.
2	ak1	We scarcely knew of each other's\nexistence back in the prison camp, but it\nseems we were both in the same boat.
3	ak1	Even if she's only latched on to me to\nget rid of the loneliness, it's good to be\nneeded. Now I have some purpose in life!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611901.json
0	bk1	I always get sad in the lead-up to the day\nof the eclipse. A spectacle of slaughter...\nI'd rather be dying in battle!
1	bk1	Why did I have to get myself\ncaptured back then...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611902.json
0	bk1	Phew. It's looking like we might\nactually meet today's quota.
1	bk1	Some days can be a lot more problematic.
2	6	What happens if we don't hit the quota?
3	bk1	It's...better you don't know...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611903.json
0	bk1	If it'll defeat Moebius, I'd happily\nwager my own life for victory.
1	bk1	Yeah... I'd love to pay back all the\npent-up rage and bitterness from\nbeing locked up all these years!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611904.json
0	bk1	I made it back to the City, but it's still\nhard for me to believe when I wake up\nevery morning.
1	bk1	Maybe it's because I'm not back in the\nold room that I used to have before I\nwent away.
2	bk1	My old room... My grandfather wound up\ngiving it to a Nopon that he adopted.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611905.json
0	bk1	My grandfather died. He was my only\nrelative in the world.
1	bk1	It's really just me and Cubibi now.
2	bk1	I wonder if we'll be able to live as\na family. I just hope that we'll be\nable to support each other, y'know?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk611906.json
0	bk1	I wanted to go to Origin with\nGhondor and the others.
1	bk1	But now it seems I've a child to worry\nabout. So I left the Lost Numbers.
2	2	A child? That's really good news\nfor you, right? Congratulations!
3	bk1	Thank you. I'll just have to leave it to\nyou to make the world safe for me and\nmy family. I'm counting on you!
4	2	We promise!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk612001.json
0	ck1	They've been making us work the whole\ntime we've been locked up in here.
1	ck1	What's more, Agnus uses the stuff\nthat we produce to carry on their war.
2	ck1	If something that I made hurt one of my\nfamily back in the City, I don't know what\nI'd do...
3	ck1	Living with that anxiety for so many\nyears... It's enough to send you crazy...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk612002.json
0	ck1	So we've got Ouroboros pitching in to\nhelp the Elder's daughter escape. Never\nwould have thought it.
1	ck1	It's a real surprise to see Ouroboros\nthat skipped out on the candidacy thing\ntoo. Didn't know that was possible.
2	ck1	Yeah, seems like all kinds of things started\nhappening since we got locked up in here.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk612003.json
0	ck1	So it seems the training exercise is going on\nas planned, and we're fairly unguarded.
1	ck1	Looking forward to turning the\ntables on those big-shots!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk612004.json
0	ck1	My baby daughter grew up a lot while\nI was locked up in the prison camp...
1	ck1	She barely even remembers who I am now.\nThat really brings home how people grow\napart from each other...
2	ck1	I should count my blessings, really. It's\na miracle to even have her back at all...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk612005.json
0	ck1	Azalea's made some new friends, it seems.\nWhen she comes back to the house, she\nalways tells me about her day.
1	ck1	Ahh, being in a home - a real home,\nwith a family... Every day is a joy.
2	ck1	If I'm going to hold on to what I've got\nhere, I'm really going to have work hard\nat being a parent.

0	rk1	Captain Kabata can be pretty pushy\nsometimes, right? She seems really\nscary at first.
1	rk1	But once you get to know her, you'll get\nthat she's always taking care of us. And\nshe has a great rep for training newbies!
2	rk1	Once she told me that she was pouring all\nthe energy from the kids that she didn't\nhave into making us strong.
3	rk1	Having kids is the norm in the City, so\npeople whisper about it. But she laughs it\noff. Says you find your own way in life.
4	rk1	I think she's so cool. I hope I can be\nlike the captain and choose my own\nway to live too.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710102.json
0	rk1	Hey, I just heard! Monica's going\nwith you to the front, right?
1	rk1	She must be brave to take that step.\nI don't know if I have it within me to\nmake a decision like that.
2	rk1	Guernica never made it back, and\nneither did Yew...
3	2	But that's the thing about fighters. When\nthey come up against something scary,\nthey can't just pretend they didn't see it.
4	rk1	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pile more worry\non you like that. Just hold on to your lives.\nNothing's more important, after all!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710103.json
0	rk1	Attacking the Castle and freeing our\nimprisoned comrades at the same time?\nIt's amazing what you Ouroboros can do!
1	rk1	I really thought that I'd never see my\nfriends again. Thank you so much!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710104.json
0	rk1	You came at just the right moment!\nThere's something I wanted to run\npast you.
1	4	Really? What is it?
2	rk1	Well, the thing is...I'm going to be a father\nsoon. Mei is pregnant, you see! I'd like it if\nyou would choose a name for the baby.
3	2	That sounds like a really big deal...
4	rk1	Well, I'm open to suggestions. I hope you'll\nthink it through when the fighting's over.\nSo you have to promise to live through it!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710201.json
0	sk1	Our job isn't just scavenging, y'know!\nWe recover modules too!
1	sk1	Both of those tasks go towards protecting\nour lives, in the here and now.
2	sk1	But it's the same for both Keves and Agnus,\nright? We all raid each other to sustain\nourselves. The pattern never changes.
3	sk1	But sometimes I'm haunted by the feeling\nthat we could all just find a way to live\ntogether somehow.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710202.json
0	sk1	Our imprisoned friends made it home!\nYou lot did something truly great for us\nthere!
1	6	But...we didn't manage to save all of them.
2	sk1	But that isn't on you. They must have\nbeen at least somewhat prepared for that,\nfrom the moment that they got captured.
3	sk1	And now that infernal prison is no more.\nThat's going to make moving around a\nlot easier for me too.
4	sk1	I'm going to make the most of it, for our\ndear friends who never made it home!

0	sk1	Joulietta turned out to be a real trooper,\nbut there's actually another soldier who's\nin conflict with their high pedigree.
1	sk1	That's Olive, an Ouroboros candidate.\nShe's from a branch family of one of\nthe Six Houses, conservative at that.
2	6	So she's a conservative, but...\nalso an Ouroboros candidate?
3	sk1	She's a rare case, certainly. Conservatives\nusually oppose fighting Moebius. They\nblock it every chance they get.
4	sk1	But Olive took it upon herself to kick that\nparticular wall down. Really, it was quite\nan achievement.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710204.json

1	tk1	I really hope everything works out...
2	2	You don't think we can handle it?
3	tk1	No no, it's got nothing to do with\nyou guys or the plan!
4	tk1	Sorry, just forget I said anything.\nThe boss'll have my guts for garters if\nI say something I'm not supposed to...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710302.json
0	tk1	Oh hey, perfect timing!
1	tk1	You lot have already smashed up\na few Flame Clocks so far, right?
2	5	Yeah, a few, I guess. Why?
3	tk1	Well, the thing is, the Lost Numbers\nare going to start paying out a bounty\nfor damage dealt to Moebius.
4	tk1	Here you go.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710303.json
0	tk1	Ah, so you showed up!
1	6	Are we getting more of that bounty?
2	tk1	Yeah! You've really done in quite a few\nof those Flame Clocks now, huh?
3	tk1	The fighting's only going to get more\nfierce from now on. I hope you'll be\nhelping us with that.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710304.json
0	tk1	Well, well, well! A personal visit\nfrom Moebius's "most wanted".
1	1	I'm not sure how I feel being\nlabeled like that.
2	tk1	For the Lost Numbers, this would be\nthe highest conceivable honor.
3	tk1	Your reputation alone's dealing\nMoebius a massive blow here!
4	tk1	Anyhow, here you go.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710305.json
0	tk1	So Moebius aren't as united as they\nmake themselves out to be, eh?\nNot too different from our Senate.
1	6	I keep hearing this word, "Senate", but\nI don't actually know what it means...
2	tk1	It's a committee made up of the Six Houses.\nSure, they're always blocking this or that,\nbut they're also a storehouse of know-how.
3	tk1	When they aren't squabbling over ideology,\nthey share their knowledge and set a\ndirection for the City.
4	tk1	The one with ultimate responsibility, we\ncall the Elder. Just one of the many\nburdens the boss is shouldering right now.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710306.json
0	tk1	Just between us, right, but the reason the\nconservative crew are biting back at the\nboss so much is 'cause she's young.
1	tk1	To be the Elder, you need judgment,\na wealth of experience...not to mention\nbeing well-liked.
2	tk1	That's the stuff that you get more of as\nyou age, according to the conservatives.\nSo they're always speaking down to her.
3	tk1	She has to contend with that while she's\ncarrying everything else. I've never heard\nher whine about it, either.
4	tk1	She's doing a real first-rate job,\nif you ask me.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710307.json
0	tk1	The boss is a Defender in the truest sense.\nOne look at her massive shield's enough\nto tell you that.
1	tk1	She can take care of herself and\nshelter allies in the process. That's\none of the amazing things about her.
2	tk1	Just don't keep her in the line of fire\nfor too long. If she goes down after a\nheavy hit, you're really in for it then.
3	tk1	Rely on her when you need to, but be\nready to help her out in a pinch. It's all\nabout teamwork in the end.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710308.json
0	tk1	Looks like the Ouroboros candidates have\ngotten a real nice boost from you guys.
1	tk1	The boss too, truth be told.\nMaybe even me, a little, tiny bit.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710309.json
0	tk1	The Lost Numbers have got your back\nevery step of the way. We're prepared\nto put everything on the line here.
1	tk1	Yeah...looking out for each other, it's\njust a license to go nuts, don't you think?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710310.json
0	tk1	Boss... You're really going\nout there yourself?
1	D	Yeah, I told you that via Iris, didn't I?\nWhat's the matter, you disappointed?
2	tk1	It's not that. Just...going to the front\nlines and all... I wonder if it's in the\nVandham blood.
3	tk1	Get right in there and give Z and the\nrest of 'em what-for from Guernica. I'll\nget a little something ready on my side.
4	D	Travis... Thanks.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710311.json
0	tk1	Mm? What is it now?
1	C	I came to get a slightly closer look.\nI was just worried that you had a rather\nworn-out countenance.
2	tk1	Oi! This is my regular ol' face, all right?\nKeep a mental note, bushy brows!
3	C	Now settle down. There's\nno need for such anger.
4	tk1	Why are you the one acting all hurt?\nI'm the one who always takes the flak\naround here!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710401.json
0	uk1	"You find what it is you're\nlooking for, in the end."
1	uk1	That was the last thing that\nmy brother Yew said to me.
2	uk1	He made up his mind to head out on\nthat important mission with Guernica...\nBut he never came back.
3	2	It's hard...losing someone important.
4	uk1	My brother was a fighter. He was prepared\nto do what he had to for his family. But\nthat doesn't make me miss him less.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710402.json
0	uk1	I heard you helped Mizuki out with\na scavenging mission the other day.\nThanks for that!
1	2	Don't mention it. It was a perfectly\nnatural thing for us to do.
2	5	Hey, I heard you're an oven-fresh\nnewlywed. Is that right? Not that I\nhave a clue what that even means.
3	5	Kabata told me that if something ever\nhappened to Mizuki, you'd cry about it.\nI guess he's a pretty important guy then!
4	uk1	Yes! Mizuki is more important to me\nthan the air we breathe! I'm so glad\nhe's safe and sound!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710403.json
0	uk1	I've always hated the eclipses... Someone's\nfriend or family would always be slaughtered,\nall just to make us feel cowed and small...
1	uk1	But this year, you saved everyone from\nthat fate. I don't mean only the prisoners.
2	uk1	You saved me too, from stewing in my\nown juices about how powerless and\ndefeated I was.
3	uk1	The future can change...\nand we can change it!
4	uk1	I want to do something to help, too.\nWhatever I can do, for the future's sake.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710404.json
0	uk1	I'd never have dreamed the day would\ncome that Moebius would raid the City.
1	uk1	But my brother and Mizuki, they didn't flinch\nfrom putting themselves in danger, doing\ntheir duty to protect our way of life...
2	uk1	So I'm going to do whatever I can.\nWhining about it changes nothing!\nThat's what you guys taught me.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710405.json
0	uk1	I decided to gather up the medical\nsupplies in the facility ahead of the\nfinal battle.
1	uk1	We never know when this place will turn\ninto a battlefield. I want everything as\nprepped as possible to treat the wounded.
2	5	Y'know... I think you've really toughened\nup. Seems like that lost vibe you had's\nall cleared up.
3	uk1	You guys taught me what was really\nimportant in life. For me, it was my family.
4	uk1	So let's win this fight, together!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710501.json
0	vk1	Grandad can carry a great tune. I feel\nso cheery and breezy when I hear it, like\nI can get through anything!
1	vk1	Some people don't like it, though. "You\ncan't defeat Moebius with music", they\nsay. But I think the world of Grandad!
2	vk1	I want to help people who encourage\nothers, not fight or hurt them.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710502.json
0	vk1	I had a really fun time talking about\nhair accessories and stuff with Azalea.
1	vk1	Shiner and San get bored when I talk\nabout that kind of thing, so it's great to\nfinally find someone who likes what I like!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710503.json
0	vk1	It's funny... I only have to play tag\nfor, like, two minutes and then I'm\nsuper sweaty!
1	3	You're moving about, love.\nThat's what makes you sweat.\nWhat's funny about that?
2	vk1	But, I never used to sweat. I think\nit's just got a bit too warm in the City\nafter everything moved.
3	4	The City used to be right at the top of the\nGreat Sword. I wonder if that would account\nfor the difference in temperature.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710504.json
0	vk1	Grandad's started writing a new\npiece of music! It's going to be a\nsong of power and bravery!
1	vk1	I'm sure he's thinking about\nyou guys when he's writing it.
2	2	Us...? Huh?
3	vk1	It's not just Grandad, either... Everyone\nin the City wants Ouroboros to win.
4	vk1	So yeah, you've got a ton of friends all\naround you. And don't you forget it!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710601.json
0	wk1	You guys fight with a whole bunch of\ndifferent weapons, right? How'd you\nfind out which ones suited you best?
1	5	How...? I guess we just picked out\nthe ones we found easiest to use...
2	1	So why were you asking\nus about that then, Shiner?
3	wk1	I just wanted to pick your brains.\nI can call pretty much any Blade now.\nBut you can't win being so flaky, right?
4	wk1	I want to settle on a weapon and get good\nat it. Then, maybe someday I'll get to be\nan Ouroboros candidate, like my dad!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710602.json
0	wk1	Being an adult looks so tough. If you don't\nkeep track of what everyone's thinking,\nyou might end up having no friends.
1	wk1	Us kids don't care about\nthat sort of thing.
2	2	"Us kids"? You mean like Neon and San?\nYou seem to hang out with them a lot.
3	wk1	Yeah. San's parent-unit is a super-strict\nteacher and into that conservative stuff.\nI guess they don't think much of me.
4	wk1	That doesn't bother me, though. You gotta\nhave backbone, not be a weakling who bails\non his friends when the going gets tough.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710603.json
0	3	Oh! It's our li'l watchdog.\nHow're things going with\nTorto and the others?
1	wk1	It's a real big fuss! It's going to take\nages to bring them up to speed.\nThey've got so much to learn!
2	wk1	But...it'll be fine. I already realized that\nColony 15 are good people. They helped\nout my dad, after all.
3	wk1	And they're all so tough!\nI've got a bit to learn from them myself...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710604.json
0	wk1	I'm from House Ortiz, me. It's the duty\nof House Ortiz to protect everyone in\nthe City.
1	wk1	But then I think about the people\nbad-mouthing the Colony 15 folks.\nWhy should I have to protect them...?
2	1	Shiner... I'm not sure that's\nthe right attitude.
3	wk1	I don't understand why everyone can't\njust show some respect and get along\nwith each other.
4	wk1	We're all people, just the same, right?\nAm I missing something?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk710605.json
0	5	Looks like you're working hard in\ntraining, mate. Really figuring out\nhow your body works.
1	wk1	Heh, thanks! It's down to good teaching!\nThat's what everyone's saying, anyway.
2	wk1	We get to train out in the open now.\nBut really, I'm just happy people can\nfinally see that Torto's a good guy!

2	6	Huh...? Uhh...\nMaybe the one on the far left?

0	hl1	Ghondor is safe! Monica isn't really letting\nit show, but she must be relieved.
1	3	Y'know, Monica never once mentioned\nthat Ghondor was her daughter. That\nwas one spark of a surprise.
2	hl1	Well, she has her position as Elder.\nShe wouldn't want people to think that\npersonal feelings were getting in the way.
3	hl1	My position is somewhat similar, so I can\nunderstand her point of view. But I worry\nshe takes it to an extreme, sometimes.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712304.json
0	hl1	The soldiers from Colony 15...\nYou set them free, right?
1	5	Uh, yeah, kinda. But, I mean,\nthey were free to begin with...
2	hl1	Running into them back then was\nthe only thing that saved my life.
3	hl1	So I suppose I owe you my life too.\nI'll have to try to think of a way to\nrepay you for that.
4	5	OK, well, don't make it too subtle,\nwill ya? You could just buy us all\na decent meal sometime.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712305.json
0	6	Playne... You're not looking too good.
1	hl1	My mother heard about what\nhappened with Torto and the others.\nShe was absolutely furious with me.
2	6	I'm sure she was. Your mother is Timna,\nright? But you're a pretty big deal, even\namong the Lost Numbers, aren't you?
3	hl1	Well, that's one thing. This is another.
4	hl1	Amongst all the heads of the Six Houses,\nshe's the one that I'd least like to get it\nin the ear from.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712306.json
0	hl1	I'd known Shania since she was little.
1	hl1	I always felt bad that she was being\ncompared to her sister, Titania...but I was\nalways told to mind my own business.
2	hl1	I could see how tough it was to be\na kid from the Six Houses. I should\nhave tried to do more...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712307.json
0	5	Whew. Good thing everyone thinks\nTriton's the Hox's socks now.
1	hl1	Yeah, I thought it might have been tough,\nbecause of what happened with Shania.
2	hl1	So it gave me some peace of mind to see\nTorto's efforts rewarded. Families have to\nstick together, eh?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712401.json
0	il1	All the City's residents are descended\nfrom the Six Houses.
1	il1	I can trace my roots back to House Ortiz,\nMonica's to House Vandham, and so on\nand so forth.
2	il1	And in remembrance of our ancestors'\nendeavors, our eyepatches are each adorned\nwith the pattern of our respective house.
3	il1	"Guests" like you have to make do with just\na plain, boring old version, I'm afraid.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712402.json
0	il1	Our ancestors fought arm in arm once.\nNow all we seem to do is bicker pointlessly\namong each other.
1	il1	In particular, the heads of House Doyle\nand House Cassini don't get on well\nwith the likes of Monica and I.
2	il1	That said, we're all on the same side\nwhen it comes to helping Ouroboros.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712403.json
0	il1	Inviting in the remnants of the Keves\narmy into the City...? I never thought\nI'd see that, not in all my years.
1	il1	They have Playne to thank for that, but\nalso the Elder's decisive judgment.
2	6	I'm sorry we caused so much fuss.\nBut Colony 15...they're good people.
3	il1	I understand that. Please don't worry.\nThere's a piece of advice I'd like to\ngive you, though.
4	il1	Look out for Garrett. He's got a lot of\nconviction, and I fear it'll make him lash\nout. I'm praying he doesn't, though.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712404.json
0	il1	Oh, Shania...\nShe was the pitiable child\nof a downtrodden house.
1	il1	But whatever happened, it doesn't\nchange the fact that she was a citizen\nof the City, one of us.
2	il1	Monica and I should have noticed what\nwas taking place. It's truly regrettable.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712405.json
0	il1	I hear you went out of your way for the\nsake of the Homecoming. Thanks to you,\nwe had a wonderful ceremony this year.
1	il1	I feel more than a little ashamed that I\nwrote off this year's event as impossible so\nsoon. Ah, perhaps age is making me soft...
2	3	Surely living a long time is good, isn't it?\nI don't get why you're beating yourself up.
3	il1	Well, wisdom comes with age, certainly.\nBut your field of view gets narrower, so\nthe future can be harder to see.
4	il1	That's why I want the youth to step out\ninto the future, carrying their own hope.\nIt's a step I'm no longer able to take.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712406.json
0	il1	Now the new alliance includes not only\nAgnus and Keves, but the City as well.
1	il1	Such an amazing feat! Yes, this generation\nof Ouroboros rank proudly with the\ngreatness of the Founders, I believe!
2	il1	Witnessing the making of history like this...\nAs long as one lives, one never ceases to\nencounter new wonders.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712501.json
0	jl1	I think the Lost Numbers are wrong\nto carry on stealing cradles at the risk\nof exposing themselves.
1	jl1	All they're doing is giving the enemy\nmore hostages and yet they still carry on!
2	jl1	We all know what kind of atrocities\nare going on at the Castle...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712502.json
0	jl1	Until now, Moebius had never been\nable to determine the City's location.
1	jl1	But now, thanks to certain traitorous\nactions, each and every one of us is\nexposed to danger.
2	jl1	How are the Lost Numbers going to\ntake responsibility for what happened\nwith Shania now?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712503.json
0	jl1	Blasted Elder's too soft on outsiders.\nDoes she pity them or something? The\nCity's safety is what should come first.
1	3	I can see where you're coming from. But\nI don't think the Colony 15 people will do\nyou any mischief...probably.
2	jl1	But they'll disturb the peace, at least.\nIf they have different values, it'll lead to\nconflict. And by then, it's too late.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712504.json
0	jl1	You Ouroboros turning up here in the\nCity's put things in motion. The world's\nstarting to change...
1	jl1	All I want to do is safeguard the lives\nthat we've had until now. Why am I so\npowerless...?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712505.json
0	4	So the conservatives are starting to\nreach a consensus, are they?
1	jl1	I sort of knew this would happen,\nbut they've yet to converge on a\nrealistic proposal.
2	jl1	Garrett's not giving straight answers either.\nIt seems we have no choice but to entrust\nthe future to the Elder and Ouroboros.
3	jl1	So, please...\nProtect the City, and all of us within it.
4	4	Yes, of course. We promise.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712601.json
0	kl1	It was at just your age when my\ngrandchild joined the Lost Numbers.
1	kl1	But...he went missing on\nhis very first mission.
2	kl1	We should never have let him go...\nI regret it to this day.
3	kl1	But now, I have the power to at least\noppose what the Lost Numbers are doing.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712602.json
0	kl1	My grandchild lives! It seems he was\nlocked away in a prison camp all this time.
1	kl1	His parents died when he was still small.\nSo I filled the gap that they left.
2	kl1	Five long years... It's really hard for me\nto think about what he must have gone\nthrough in that time.
3	kl1	But the fact that he's back is the\nmost important thing. That's made\nme very happy.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712603.json
0	kl1	Thanks for what you did before.\nIt was life-saving.
1	kl1	I'm afraid I don't have much to offer\nyou in thanks, apart from my needlework.
2	kl1	If you'd like to learn, please let me\nknow. I'd be happy to teach you!
3	3	Yeah! That'd be awesome!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712604.json
0	kl1	Monica and Rozana really handled\nthemselves well, didn't they?
1	kl1	Even though Garrett was supporting\nBroo, it ended in their defeat, and\nregret, I daresay.
2	3	Huh, so the ones against fighting\nwere helping the ones for it...?
3	kl1	That's right! They had completely\ndifferent ideas, but it worked to catch\nMonica off-guard.
4	kl1	Alliances really can spring up in\nthe strangest of places, you know.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712605.json
0	kl1	I've been thinking, lately...
1	kl1	Rather than us or the Six Houses,\nmaybe you should be the ones to\ndecide the future.
2	3	But, I mean... You're from the City?\nYou're a citizen here.
3	kl1	That's true. But we're too predisposed\nto focusing on the here and now.
4	kl1	If we keep doing that forever, then\nthe world will come to a standstill.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712701.json
0	ll1	The Lost Numbers locked up in\nthe prison camp were all captured\nduring missions they'd undertaken.
1	ll1	They've remained here year after\nyear, with hardly a hope of getting out...
2	ll1	And we had no idea what kind of life\nthey've been leading here...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712702.json
0	5	We're gonna bust 'em out!\nEvery last one of 'em!
1	ll1	Make sure you do!\nWe're counting on you, Ouroboros!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712703.json
0	3	Got yourself a real fanclub, eh, Kryto?\nEveryone seems to go wild for you.
1	ll1	Yeah? I guess I do get a buzz of energy\nfrom my fans. For that I'm really grateful.
2	ll1	If I can show people there's hope in\nsurviving, then I can fight any battle.
3	3	Oh yeah? I reckon I'm starting to\nunderstand the whole Kryto Effect now!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712704.json
0	ll1	Seems a lot of materials we gathered\nat Corne Island are things that've been\nhard to come by lately.
1	ll1	Everyone was really glad about being\nable to take care of Levnis maintenance\nand mending the streets.
2	1	So it was worth going against regulations,\nwouldn't you say?
3	ll1	Oh, like you wouldn't believe.
4	ll1	We're going to throw in our lot in the final\nbattle against the Moebius. Let's save the\nworld, and save it together!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712705.json
0	ll1	A lot of our fighters never make it\nto their Homecoming, either. But...
1	ll1	When I think of people out there living\nfor just ten years, with no complaints...\nIt just doesn't seem fair, you know?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712801.json
0	ml1	I hear you're breaking into the\nprison camp. Good luck with that.
1	3	Huh... How'd you know about that?
2	ml1	Information gathering is what I do.
3	3	...Where's a good comeback\nwhen I need one?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712802.json
0	ml1	So the City was a Ferronis this whole time.\nI had no idea. The fact that it could move\nwas just as much of a surprise!
1	4	It's a surprise to me that there's anything\nthat you don't know, Miyori! It means there\nstill might be more City secrets to discover.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712803.json
0	ml1	I hear that Yarmil was kicked\nout of the Lost Numbers...
1	1	News reaches you fast, as ever...
2	ml1	Well, it was me that gave the\ninformation to Rozana.
3	ml1	When all the bad apples are weeded out,\nI think my job will get a bit easier.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712804.json
0	ml1	Who would have thought that such a big\nthing would come out of the vortex...
1	ml1	I wonder if I'll survive\nto see my Homecoming...?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712805.json
0	ml1	Now that I've hit age twenty... Maybe\nfinally I can expect to get some actually\nimportant duties assigned to me.
1	2	Seems like you have a whole lot\non your plate already, though...
2	ml1	Not really! I was never really treated\nas a full adult, not yet.
3	ml1	I can't just stagnate as a regular grunt in\nthe Lost Numbers my whole life. I need\nto catch up with Kryto, pronto.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712901.json
0	nl1	So you smashed up the Castle's\nAnnihilator, huh?
1	nl1	We used the chaos you kindly\ncreated, to kick Keves in the\nproverbial by raiding the pods.
2	nl1	You Ouroboros... You're like a star of hope\nrising above this City.
3	nl1	You've set an awfully high standard for\nyourselves!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712902.json
0	nl1	If Keves had an Annihilator, it would've\nbeen wise to assume Agnus has one too.
1	nl1	It's fair to say, mistakes were made.
2	nl1	And I never would have imagined\nthe City itself could move.
3	nl1	But in any case, you Ouroboros did\nyourselves proud out there.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk712903.json
0	nl1	Shania stabbed us in the back good and\nproper, didn't she?
1	nl1	It was down to Garrett and the Elder's\nunderestimation of the situation. They\ntotally should have foreseen this...
2	nl1	But the way it was handled, there was\nno way it couldn't have gotten out of\nhand.
3	nl1	We've got to take care of Moebius\nonce and for all, before any more\nturncoats do the dirty on us.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713001.json
0	ol1	You already know this, but...
1	ol1	Agnus and Keves have been fighting\nforever.
2	ol1	And we've been living so that we escape\nthe notice of Agnus, Keves and Moebius,\nfor just as long.
3	ol1	I think it's about time we stopped living\nthis way, don't you?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713002.json
0	ol1	Thanks to what you did, not only\nLi Garte Prison Camp, but the Castle\nitself has been liberated.
1	ol1	That's Ouroboros power!
2	ol1	That revolt was a long time coming.\nNow we've got to ride that momentum!
3	6	Yeah! Right on!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713003.json
0	ol1	This episode of betrayal's really\ncut me to the quick.
1	ol1	If we're going to stand against Moebius,\nI don't see how we can do it without the\nsupport of Ouroboros.
2	ol1	You are the hope of all of us.\nPlease, bring us the result we need.
3	5	Yeah, we got it covered!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713101.json
0	pl1	The City isn't without its own internal\nsquabbles. But at Michiba Canteen,\neveryone is a valued customer!
1	pl1	No matter your viewpoints or beliefs,\nall I want for you is to enjoy some\ndelicious food.
2	pl1	Speaking of! I'd recommend\nAcqua Pazza à la City. It's classic\nCity cuisine!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713102.json
0	pl1	I'm actually quite busy right now. I hired\nsome new assistants to help me out, but it\nhasn't quite eased the load yet.
1	pl1	I've really had to show them an awful lot,\nabout the canteen, and the City too. I can\nunderstand though, it's all new to them.
2	pl1	It'll be well worth the effort of\ntraining them up, though!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713104.json
0	pl1	Get a load of your mugs right now!\nLooking pretty determined, aren't we?
1	pl1	But are you sure you've eaten enough?\nYou need to make it through tomorrow\nalive. Don't neglect nutrition now!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713105.json
0	pl1	The cook-off result was very close!\nI think any of the entrants could have\nbeen the winner!
1	pl1	Miyabi came really close, too!\nI hope she'll take the prize\nnext year!
2	pl1	Ah, her cooking just has some kind\nof glow to it! And I know a thing or\ntwo about cooking, so I'm not wrong.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713106.json
0	pl1	Oh, how amazing...\nI met the honest-to-goodness Queen!
1	pl1	Better get to the Remembrance Stones...\nDon't want the others to beat me to it!
2	6	Beat you to it...?\nBeat you to what?
3	pl1	Haha! Reporting to our ancestors, I mean!
4	pl1	Everything that we've endured, everything\nthat we've lived through until today has\nbeen rewarded, at last!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713201.json
0	ql1	What's up? Am I a rare sight to you?
1	ql1	The City's got three types of folk:\npromising youngsters, hard-working adults,\nand old folks with time on their hands!
2	3	Time on your hands? Like, you don't\nhave anything you need to do?
3	ql1	We paint, write poetry, play an\ninstrument... Or in my case, have a\ngood old drink every day!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713202.json
0	ql1	So, the bunch who got captured by Agnus\nmade it back here! Incredible!
1	ql1	I thought once they got captured, they\nwere gone for good and I'd never see\nthem again!
2	ql1	This is a truly happy and auspicious\noccasion! Better have a drink to celebrate!
3	6	Does he ever not drink?!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713203.json
0	ql1	It's about time someone gave Moebius\nwhat-for, isn't it?
1	ql1	Now...it's like the very thing that I dreamed\nof as a youngster is coming true.
2	ql1	And that's to give Moebius\na good thrashing! Let's drink to that,\nand with gusto!
3	6	You know what, I'm good.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713801.json
0	vl1	So the infiltration went fine, but then\nall hell broke loose... Well, it's hardly\na surprise.
1	vl1	Ghondor's always been that way.\nMust be tough for poor Aggy and Oggy.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713802.json
0	vl1	Our mission is to rescue Ghondor from\nthe prison camp. She knows the location\nof the true Queens.
1	vl1	So just make sure you have your\npriorities straight, OK? Don't forget\nwhat you're here to do.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713803.json
0	vl1	We were resigned to the fact that the\npeople seized while rescuing Ghondor\nwould take years to break out.
1	vl1	But you Ouroboros made short\nwork of that.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713804.json
0	vl1	I feel sorry for Shania.\nNot that she'd want my pity.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713805.json
0	vl1	At the Remembrance Stones I reported that\nthe mission my brother and the others set\nout for is complete. After all these years...
1	vl1	I also told him to entrust protecting\nMonica to me, and to watch over us.\nA kind of declaration of war, if you will.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713806.json
0	vl1	Getting to gaze upon the true Queen...\nIt's incredible. I feel truly blessed.
1	vl1	Honestly, it hardly feels real.\nIt's like our generation is fulfilling\nthe greatest promise of our ancestors.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713901.json
0	wl1	There were a lot of soldiers in this prison\nwho I know well.
1	wl1	It was devastating not knowing whether\nthey were alive or dead, so it was\na huge relief to see they're still alive.
2	wl1	I know the mission here is to rescue\nGhondor, but I also want to make sure that\nwe get everyone else home if we can.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713902.json
0	wl1	If we don't get Ghondor out of here,\nthe City has no future! We've gotta\npush forward with everything!
1	6	Yeah! Let's do it!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713903.json
0	wl1	So glad you lot made it\nthrough unscathed!
1	wl1	Those Moebius were a cut above.\nI'm still reeling from all the excitement!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713904.json
0	wl1	I've known Jansen for years now, so\nI knew about his big brother and Monica.
1	wl1	To think he's felt that way about\nher ever since he was a kid...!
2	wl1	Ah, my heart gets all stirred up thinking\nabout it! I hope I get to experience such\na colossal romance one day too!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713905.json
0	wl1	We've got permission to attack in the\nfinal battle against Moebius now.
1	wl1	I'm going to fight too...and I'll be carrying\nthe hopes and dreams of Heewa and\nGuernica on my back. We've gotta win!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk713906.json
0	wl1	Everyone in the City has really cheered\nup since the Queen got here.
1	wl1	All the old folks who used to be\nOuroboros candidates are especially\nstirred up and excited about it.
2	wl1	They're insisting they can still fight, getting\nback to Blade training... Nice seeing them\nfired up, but I hope they don't get hurt...
evt/tlk/msg_tlk714001.json
0	xl1	If she'd have lost heart, I would have\ngiven her a good thrashing... But Ghondor's\nGhondor, wherever she goes.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk714002.json
0	xl1	Finally, that damn warden guy\nis going to take a good kicking...
1	2	That's not our primary objective,\nin case you didn't know.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk714003.json
0	xl1	Shania stabbed us in the back.\nI can't believe it.
1	xl1	Damn it all...! We thought of her\nas a friend, but I guess she didn't\nfeel the same way.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk714004.json
0	xl1	Shania... Why...?
1	6	Nissick...
2	xl1	Gah! Go pester somebody else\nif you've got nothing better to do!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk714005.json
0	xl1	What can you fill a fifty-page\napology with...?
1	5	Not quite done yet, eh?\nBest of luck, mate.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk714006.json
0	xl1	Ha! Ghondor said my cooking\nwas "pretty tasty"! That means\nI beat her!
1	3	Uhm... Yeah?\nProbably?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk714101.json
0	yl1	The identification devices work pretty\nwell, it seems.
1	yl1	Just take care the guards don't\nsee our little modifications...
2	yl1	And drawing attention to yourself by\nInterlinking is absolutely out\nof the question, got it?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk714102.json
0	yl1	The security's pretty solid around here.\nI can well believe that Kisame is the only\none to ever make it out.
1	yl1	But we're going to turn that on its head.\nWe'll be the ones to sneak in and\nbust back out!
2	4	That's right. Let's be sure we\nstay on track until the mission\nis accomplished.
3	yl1	Hardly needs saying!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk714103.json
0	yl1	I always knew that the City itself was a\nFerronis. The real shocker was finding\nit can still move.
1	4	Must have been considerably confidential\nfor you to know about it but not Shania.
2	yl1	The Founder of my house was something\nspecial. I think even among the Six Houses\nonly a few people knew the truth.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk714104.json
0	yl1	We weren't strong enough to stop a Moebius\non our own... I'm still bitter about that.
1	yl1	If we're going to protect the City,\nwe're going to have to come up\nwith something else.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk714105.json
0	yl1	We created a lot of trouble for you and\nfor Monica. I hope that you can forgive us.
1	1	Guess I never thought that you'd\njoin in on something like that.
2	yl1	I just wanted to do whatever I could to\nhelp. Turns out it was a good opportunity\nto find out I have a lot left to learn.
3	yl1	I took the liberty of collecting opinions\nfrom each of us on our expected postings.
4	yl1	I'm not too sure who I should present\nthem to though... Lieutenant Travis, or\nMonica?
evt/tlk/msg_tlk714106.json
0	yl1	The authority that the Queen projects is of\na really different sort to that of the heads\nof the Six Houses.
1	yl1	She really has this powerful aura of grace,\nsurrounding a will of iron.
2	yl1	That's not the kind of presence you can\nacquire in ten short years, surely.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk714201.json
0	zl1	Monica's little crew of running dogs, huh?\nWell, you can leave me right out of it,\nwhatever it is.
1	4	No, that's not us.
2	zl1	What, you ain't Lost Numbers?\nWell that's all right, then.
3	zl1	Not everyone in the City supports the\nLost Numbers crew, y'know.
4	zl1	Some of us want nothing more than a\nquiet, peaceful life. That's what I want,\nanyway. To be left in peace!
evt/tlk/msg_tlk714202.json
0	zl1	Ever seen Hope's Rest?
1	5	Yeah, we have actually.

0		House Vandham
1		In memory of the Founder of House Vandham,\nthe City's Restorer and Liberator.
2		The original incarnation of the City was once\nlaid to ruin by Moebius N's hand.
3		The Founder realized fully the power of Ouroboros,\nheretofore limited, and fought against N, ousting him.
4		Once victorious, he gathered the old City's people,\nscattered to the winds, and reestablished the City.
5		With the City restored, he left its government\nin the hands of the Founder of Doyle, and\ndeparted on a lonely expedition.
6		No records exist of his fate thereafter.
7		Heirs of Vandham's lineage only returned\nto the new City several centuries later.
8		Oral tradition has it that the Founder was master of\nthe classical art of fistfighting, and the scions of\nHouse Vandham carry on the custom to this day.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk717701.json
0		House Cassini
1		In memory of the Founder of House Cassini\nand the City's Liberatrix.
2		Much like with the Founder of Reid, this statue, too,\ndepicts this Founder's respected mentor rather than\nthe Founder herself.
3		The mentor boasted a robust physique, wielding two\ngreat swords at once with utmost ease, and facing\ndown Moebius despite the loss of one eye.
4		He lived his life an unsophisticated sort, broad-minded\nbut impassioned, and is said to have aided the Founders\nin the fight against Moebius, physically and spiritually.
5		He was further reported to have been a free spirit,\nwhose qualities influenced the other Founders, still\nyoung and impressible when the City was restored.
6		Indelible proof of this rebellious spirit can\nbe seen time and again in the ethos of the\nHouse in generations to come.

0		House Rhodes
1		A soldier of Agnus, this Founder's fight to the death\nagainst the Founder of Ortiz, a soldier of Keves, was\ninterrupted by a chance meeting with other Founders.
2		Freed from the bondage of her Flame Clock,\nshe joined the fight against Moebius.
3		Although a soldier, the Founder is reported to\nhave been exceedingly gentle and kind at heart.
4		Additionally, her skill in the healing arts\ngreatly contributed to the development of\nmedical science in the City in later ages.
5		And irrespective of starting life as an Agnian soldier...
6		...she is said to have surpassed 80 years\nof age, though the way she achieved that\nremains shrouded in mystery.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk717901.json
0		House Ortiz
1		In memory of the Founder of House Ortiz\nand the City's Liberator.
2		A Kevesi soldier, this Founder was released from\nthe Flame Clock system by the other Founders...
3		...and henceforth, spent every last ounce of\nhis energy for the cause: to liberate the City\nas one of the first Ouroboros.
4		With surpassing skill in mechanical engineering,\nthe Founder fought not with a Blade, but with\na weapon of his own fabrication.
5		He was also responsible for laying the foundations of all\nthe mechanical systems supporting the City to this day.
6		Following the fight against Moebius, he poured the\nremainder of his days into rebuilding the City, before\nfinally perishing at the age of 80 years...
7		...though how he attained that feat despite his\norigins as a Kevesi soldier remains unexplained.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk718001.json
0		House Reid
1		In memory of the Founder of House Reid\nand the City's Liberatrix.
2		Rather than the Founder herself, this statue depicts\nthe Founder's mentor figure, standing as a sign of the\ndeep reverence and devotion she felt for her teacher.
3		The Founder's master was unconnected to her\nby bonds of blood, yet he raised her as would befit\na child of one's own, it is said.
4		Though of a calm and constant disposition,\nthe sight of him on the battlefield, great red sword\nin hand, struck fear into many a Moebius.
5		And though the vicious struggle against Moebius\ncost this ferocious warrior his right arm...
6		...the loss did nothing to diminish his desire to\nhone his martial skills each day, standing as\nvivid testament to his indomitable will.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk718101.json
0		House Doyle
1		In memory of the Founder of House Doyle\nand the City's Liberatrix.
2		Directly descended from those who\nestablished the first, original City.
3		Her whereabouts were lost after N's ravaging of the\nCity of old, but upon encountering the other Founders,\nshe committed herself fully to the fight.
4		This Founder is said to have a familial relation to the\nFounder of Vandham, with scant extant records\nsuggesting they were likely brother and sister.
5		She fought alongside the Founder of Vandham\nthen, who was the elder of the two, and brought\nthe power of Ouroboros to completion.
6		Said to have been bright and wise, this\nFounder laid the cornerstones for much of\nthe City's governance and legal system.
evt/tlk/msg_tlk718201.json
0		The Ouroboros Stone's Cage
1		The object on display upon this plinth is the\nvery first, original Ouroboros Stone's cage.
2		It is important to note that initial designs\nfor the monument are said to have included\na statue of a Seventh Founder in its place.
3		Next to no information remains about the\nSeventh Founder's identity, and it is possible that\nthis is not due to a simple loss of records.
4		Rather, historians speculate that this is the result of\na conscious decision by the Seventh Founder.

0	6	Huh? Is it just me or is that rock sparkling?
1	8	Hoho! Maybe is-
2	8	No. Just ordinary rock.
3	2	What about this? I can't tell them apart...
4	8	That OK! That what Riku here for!
5	2	It's a good thing you're with us, Riku.
6	8	Leave to Riku!\nFirst, Riku and friends search area!
evt/tq/msg_tq000806f.json
0	6	Hey, I found one!
1	8	No, this not right.
2	8	But is useful, so Riku take it.
evt/tq/msg_tq000807f.json
0	3	Isn't this one?
1	8	It look like, but is not. Observe here\nprecisely. Intensity of luster grow dim.
2	3	OK, I believe you.
3	8	But it not useless!\nKeep hold for now.
evt/tq/msg_tq000808f.json
0	4	This is...not one.
1	8	Oho? This might be valuable at\nlater time, so we should keep.
2	4	OK, got it.
evt/tq/msg_tq000809f.json
0	9	Riku seem to find great joy in rocks.\nHe pick up so many!
1	8	Gemstone and ore are different from\nnormal rock scattered around.
2	8	And ore we pick up from before\nhave great utility.
3	9	Manana not rock scientist...
4	6	You could identify them all, Riku!\nYou sure know a lot about rocks.
5	8	Riku know thing or two.
6	5	Don't be modest. You've got skills, mate.\nYou should be an appraiser.
7	8	Cease with flattering.
8	6	It's not flattery!\nIt's good to have a hobby!
9	9	Manana in agreement!
10	5	It's pretty good that we were able to\ncome out rock-collecting, huh, Riku?
11	8	Ore and gemstone! Not rock!
12	8	From supply material to maintenance\nwork, that Riku's job.
13	8	It solemn responsibility to keep important\nequipment in tip-top order so everyone\ncan come back alive.
14	8	Just doing own job.\nNot like Lanz.
15	5	You what? I'm pretty much\nalmost sort of doing it!
16	6	Wow... You really give yourself\na lot of responsibility, Riku.
17	8	Too much talking.\nOut of Riku's character.
18	1	Not at all. Understanding each other\nbetter isn't a bad thing, is it?
19	9	That right. Become better\nfriends is important.
20	2	We need to learn more about each other\nto become better friends, right?
21	9	That exactly truth. Learning about\neach other very important deal!
22	9	Ah, Manana has idea!\nNext Manana will show favorite thing!
23	8	Next? It not about taking turns...
24	9	Bate breath in readiness!\nManana show you her specialty!\nYou learn soon!
25	9	Over there is good place. Time for break!
evt/tq/msg_tq000810f.json
0	5	Mmm, so tasty! Nothing like a hearty meal\nto keep you going for the long haul!
1	1	It even wakes you up somehow.
2	6	Endless rations are so boring.\nYou need to spice it up like this!
3	9	Manana couldn't agree more!
4	9	Taion only cook tragedies, so\nManana work hard to learn cooking!
5	3	Ha, first I've heard of it.\nIs he that bad?
6	9	It very horrible.
7	4	Actually, my cooking just focuses more\non efficient absorption of nutrients and\nconvenient portability.
8	4	And I've actually optimized it.
9	3	...You mean it used to be even worse?
10	2	H-hey now, I like Taion's\ncooking! It's...unique!
11	1	It's OK. Swallow it down quickly\nand you'll probably be fine.
12	6	Do you...\nDo you really think you're helping...?
13	8	Is there second helping?
14	5	Oh yeah?
15	8	...What?
16	5	What's this, Riku?\nYour favorite food or something?
17	8	Is not favorite. Is taste of Manana\nhard work, and is rude not to clean plate.
18	9	Actually, Manana season with frazzlefish\nto bring out hidden flavor. Manana pleased\nRiku notice!
19	8	Mehh... Riku not know that actually.
20	9	You not know? Well, Manana\nonly happy you know now!
21	9	And Manana bring Riku\nwhole mountain of seconds!
22	5	You think he minds?
23	2	It was so good he had seconds. And\nManana knows how much he liked her\ncooking. I don't see the problem.
24	6	She was so happy.
25	1	I think her ability to accept people's words\nupfront is one of her best points.
26	2	Haha, maybe she's a little too upfront.
27	4	And her air of innocence\nis...characteristic of Nopon.
28	3	Upfront and innocent, huh...
29	8	Riku is also good honest Nopon.
30	3	Let's not get into that.
31	6	You were so serious when you\nwere looking for the ore and gems.
32	6	It's really good to be able to throw\nyourself into stuff like that so passionately.\nLike, into the things you love!
33	8	Sena is good person. Is shame\nLanz lacking this quality...
34	5	Why are you always picking on me?!
35	1	Just up ahead might be Riku's treasure.
36	6	Then let's go treasure-hunting!
37	8	Yes! Riku get mighty whiff\nof treasure here!
38	1	OK, let's have a quick breather\nand then start the search.
39	8	As Noah wish! We definitely find it!
evt/tq/msg_tq000811f.json
0	2	Huh? Hey, isn't that...?
1	8	Ohoho! Now that what Riku\ncall a gemstone!
2	9	Manana will bring back!
3	8	Gemstone need careful\nhandling. Riku will also go.
4	1	Wait! Riku! Manana!
5	9	Meh-meh-meh?!
6	8	This blight on personal record...
7	5	Wait there, we're coming!
8	4	No good, they're coming this way too!
9	2	Drop the gem! The monsters\nseem to be after them!
10	8	Meh...!
11	9	That is precious thing!\nCannot be thrown away!
12	8	Sorry to bundle Manana up\nin recklessness of Riku.
13	8	Manana must throw gemstone\nover that way.
14	9	But it your treasure, Riku!
15	8	True... But if Manana throw,\nthen monsters go also.
16	9	Riku giving up too easy!
17	8	Meh-meh?!
18	9	This nothing-trouble!
19	9	And also...
20	9	Riku say he get every treasure!
21	8	But Nopon not fight!
22	9	That irrelevant!
23	9	Should become like Mio and Noah!
24	9	If Riku and Manana work together,\nthis piece of pollen orb!
25	9	Riku not agree?
26	8	Manana...
27	8	Riku agree.
28	8	Riku not give up in this place!
29	8	Riku here to get treasures\nand beat monsters!
30	9	Manana can be behind that!
31	8	Is not yet time...
32	9	...for give up!
33	8	One, two...
34	9	Magnificent success!
35	5	Nice job, you two!\nWhat a team!
36	6	I'm so glad you made it back!
37	9	Manana sorry for causing worry.
38	8	Now we see real Nopon potential!
39	9	That right!
40	9	Maybe it impossible for one Nopon...
41	8	But not for two!
42	9	Together-fighting is better!
evt/tq/msg_tq000812f.json
0	5	Phew. I didn't know how\nthat was going to end.
1	1	Right? I was so surprised to see\nthat from Riku and Manana!
2	2	I didn't know they could fight like that.
3	8	Riku is superior Nopon!\nEveryone know still Nopon run deep.
4	5	Come off it, you aren't running anywhere.
5	6	But now we know you can fight with us.\nHow reassuring is that?!
6	9	We sorry for worry. But we learn\nthat combine power together mean\nwe can fight!
7	9	And that not all!\nWe fetch back nice stash of gemstone!
8	6	Thanks for doing that, guys!
9	8	Yes! Getting best treasure\nis thanks to Riku.
10	5	Someone sounds chuffed with himself.
11	4	Looks like the danger's passed\nfor now. Let's keep going.
12	1	Right. We're still not out of these tunnels.\nKeep your guards up, everyone.
13	9	Manana do Manana's best!
14	2	Haha, you're an asset to\nthe team, you two!
15	8	...Riku just doing job.
evt/tq/msg_tq000901f.json
0	4	What's wrong, Commander?
1	A	Hm? Oh. It's you guys.
2	A	The Ferronis was heavily damaged\nduring the battle, do you remember?
3	A	As a result, some of our remote-\nadministrated Auto-Levs aren't responding\nto transmitted instructions.
4	3	I'm not 100% on the techno-babble,\nbut... That doesn't sound good.
5	A	Indeed. I've sent some of our tech guys\nover so we'll know soon enough.
6	2	Do you really need the machines?
7	6	Are you thinking there might be\nanother battle?
8	A	It's nothing like that, I assure you.
9	A	Colony Lambda's now focused\non ether mining, and-
10	1	Wh-what was that?!
11	vc1	We just received word\nof a tunnel collapse!
12	A	What?!
13	A	I'll be there ASAP.\nAre the troops assembled?
14	vc1	They're all in position.
15	A	Then go on ahead.
16	A	Sorry about this, after you took\nthe trouble to come all the way here.
17	4	Commander, please let us lend a hand!
18	A	Only if you're sure.
19	A	But your help will be welcome.
20	4	Roger that!
21		Isurd has temporarily\njoined the party.
evt/tq/msg_tq000902f.json
0	A	The tunnel walls should have been\nstabilized! What happened?!
1	5	Hey, look over there!
2	2	It's collapsed.
3	6	Ah! We got monsters!
4	A	They must have been living in a place\nwith elevated ether concentration, then\nfound their way in here.
5	1	We better get there quick!
6	A	There's no direct path there.\nWe'll have to go around...
7	5	You've got Levnises, don't you?\nOne'd make short work of these things.
8	vc1	But we need permission from each squad's\nleader to activate a Levnis...
9	3	Oh, come the snuff on, this is an\nemergency!
10	A	You stay here on standby.\nThere might be another collapse,\nso we'll go on alone.
11	vc1	But Commander...!
12	A	Execute a partial evacuation\nonce the tunnel mouth is secured.
13	A	Coordinate with the medic corps\nand treat any wounded.
14	A	These are special orders for which I take\nfull accountability. Inform the other troops.
15	vc1	Yes, sir!
16	A	Now, all of you...
17	4	We'll be fine, Commander.\nYou can count on us.
18	A	...Understood. I'm sorry\nfor dragging you into this.
evt/tq/msg_tq000903f.json
0	A	Can anyone hear me?\nWe're here to help!
1	@n1	Commander! We're safe,\nno casualties here!
2	A	Looks like there weren't too many\nworking this deep inside. I'm glad\neveryone's unharmed.
3	A	I didn't think there'd be a cave-in here,\nconsidering the geology and with this\nlevel of structural support.
4	A	I suppose the cave wall was weak\nenough for the monsters lurking\nthere to break through.
5	4	When the excavation uncovered an area\nof concentrated deposits, the monsters\nthat lived there must've sensed a chance.
6	A	The ether find is good news, but\nfor now let's get everyone out.
7	1	There might be more monsters.\nWe'd better keep an eye out.
8	4	Noted.
evt/tq/msg_tq000904f.json
0	A	That looks somewhat cleaned up.
1	1	I guess riding a Levnis meant they\navoided any serious injuries.
2	A	A little silver lining to a great\nbig cloud. Glad to hear.
3	A	Taion... No, all of you.\nThanks for your assistance.\nYou saved us.
4	4	On the contrary, Commander.\nWe were just following your orders.
5	1	Right. We could only react so fast\nthanks to your quick thinking.
6	A	That's about as\nmuch as I can do.
7	A	The people of Colony Lambda, and you as\nwell, all knew what needed to be done,\nand due to that, the rescue was a success.
8	A	I can't thank you enough.
9	1	You've even managed to secure a nearby\nether deposit. I'm a bit jealous!
10	A	Yes. Actually our troops reported\na harvestable ether source recently.
11	A	With enough resources in the bank,\nperhaps the colony can have some\npeace of mind.
12	1	I hear a fair few colonies are lacking ether.
13	A	Everyone knows that\nwe're nothing without it.
14	A	Everyone in Lambda knows to be\nprepared to do anything in their power,\nrather than lose it.
15	A	By the way, how are your travels?
16	4	Our...travels?
17	A	Sometimes I'm envious of folk like\nyou, strong-willed and forging ahead.
18	4	W-well, we're not that-
19	5	Actually, I think being a commander is\na pretty big deal in its own way, eh?
20	A	Heh... Smoldering Cammuravi and the\nfamed Silvercoat certainly are...
21	A	But I'm not that kind of\nlone pioneering type.
22	1	I think...most people feel the same.
23	A	I know my own weakness best of anyone.
24	A	The day we lost Nimue and you, Taion,\nI abandoned all thought.
25	A	The Consul sensed my weakness,\nknew I'd pass my responsibility to another,\nand took merciless advantage of it.
26	4	...Oh.
27	A	That's one thing I learned from losing.
28	A	Ironically, if I hadn't experienced\nthat loss, I... I'd never have come\nto understand this feeling in me.
29	A	Sorry, no one needs to hear all that.
30	A	Ah, yes, I owe you all, don't I?\nWould you come to the\nCommander's Office later?
31	A	I'll be waiting.
evt/tq/msg_tq000905f.json
0	A	So. I wanted to thank you all somehow.
1	1	We didn't lend a hand just so you'd\ngive us something in return.
2	3	Too right, we don't expect any thanks.
3	A	That may be so, but...
4	2	Oh yeah, did the thing with the\nAuto-Levs get sorted out?
5	A	I only just got a report saying they\ndon't know why they won't work...
6	A	After seeing that cave-in,\nI want to investigate thoroughly.
7	A	An Auto-Lev is vital for that investigation.
8	A	If we can't bring them back here,\nthey can't be of any use to us.
9	5	Here it comes...
10	A	I'm not planning on getting you\ninvolved for every little thing.
11	A	I already can't thank you enough\nfor your help with the cave-in.
12	vc1	Excuse me, Commander.\nI have a report about the\nautonomous Levnises.
13	A	Any new developments?
14	vc1	Yes, sir. It seems they're operational.
15	A	I see.
16	vc1	They wanted you to take a look and\njudge if they can be used or not, sir.
17	A	...Roger that.
18	A	Well, I'm sorry for bringing you\nall out here. I have to go.
19	4	I'd like to come along.
20	A	What do you mean?
21	3	Ooh, good call!\nI need some closure on this.
22	1	We won't get in the way.\nIs that OK?
23	A	As you wish. Then follow me.
evt/tq/msg_tq000906f.json
0	5	We don't exactly have what I'd\ncall an open schedule...
1	4	Sorry... I know this is selfish.
2	5	Nah mate...I don't blame you.
3	4	I may owe Commander Isurd a\ngreat debt.
4	4	But he's also someone I'd just want\nto help, even if I didn't owe him.
5	4	I think every soldier in Lambda\nprobably feels the same.
6	2	It sounds nice, doesn't it?\nFeeling an attachment to your colony,\nto your commander.
7	1	Yeah, definitely.
8	A	...!
9	1	What happened?!
10	A	Hey, is everything OK?
11	_n1	C-Commander...
12	_n1	The Levnises...\nThey started moving all of a sudden...
13	A	What?
14	_n1	And then they just came for us!
15	A	But any autonomous unit should have\nsafeguards to stop it attacking us...
16	Wo1	Aaaaah!
17	4	That came from right up ahead!
18	5	Huh, lucky thing we tagged along, eh?
19	4	Please stay back, Commander!\nWe can take i-
20	A	What are you saying, man?\nI'm fighting.
21	A	It'd be a lousy example for the troops\nif I just stood around and stared!
22	1	Then let's go!

1	2	But why did they go berserk?
2	vc1	It might have been set so they couldn't\ntell between friend and foe once restarted.
3	A	You think so?
4	A	So you're saying that forcing them to restart\noverwrote the previous instructions?
5	6	Oh man...
6	A	I'll have engineering\ngive me the details.

22	A	Call me any time you need me.\nI'll come running no matter what.
23	4	Thank you very much, Commander!
24	A	I'd better brush up on my\nskills to keep up with you all.
25	A	Colony Lambda will have to keep up\nwith its current developments, too.
26	5	We can help you with stuff like that, mate.
27	A	Now look here, I can't\nask that of you-
28	1	Look, we're friends now.\nNothing wrong with asking\nyour friends for help.
29	A	...

31	A	You're incredibly trusting, you know that?
32	5	What's that supposed to mean?\nWe're just helping.
33	A	I don't mean anything bad by it.\nIf I need you, I'll ask for you.

15	tk1	...Oh, but no word of it to the boss lady,\nyeah? My salary's on the line here!
16	5	That's a corker of a preamble,\nmate. You gonna actually tell us\nwhat's going on?
17	tk1	Somebody opened one of the cradles.
18	1	You think it was an intruder?
19	tk1	I don't know! But there weren't any\nobvious signs of it.
20	tk1	The soldier inside has gone missing as well.\nSomeone you knew, I gather? It's, uh...
21	tk1	...Uhhh, tch, come on, it's on the tip of\nme tongue... Y'know, what's-her-name...\nUhh... With the silver hair?
22	1	No way... Ethel?
23	tk1	That's it, Ethel!
24	tk1	Why's all this happening on my\nwatch...? Ah, never mind, now's\nnot the time for reflection.
25	C	If such is the situation...
26	C	I shall assist as well.\nWhere shall we look?
27	C	...What?
28	6	Erm, we were just, surprised?\nThat you were so, er, concerned...?
29	C	I am also recently of a cradle born.\nIt may be some kind of fate at work.
30	C	This soldier named Ethel, she may\nalso find herself at a loss.
31	1	So he...didn't actually remember...?
32	C	And also... You, good sir.
33	tk1	Huh? Me?
34	C	You must be frightfully exhausted...\nDo not push yourself, please.
35	tk1	Hey, watch it, fella. I know I'm no spring\nchicken, but there's no need to rub it in!
36	5	Sorry mate, he's just been born...\nI'm pretty sure he didn't mean\nanything bad by it.
37	3	Anyway, moving along!
38	3	Movement in and out of the City is\nstrictly regulated, so if there weren't any\nincidents reported so far...
39	3	...both the perp and Ethel must\nstill be somewhere inside.
40	1	Yeah, you're right. Let's first search for\nclues in the module warehouse.
41	tk1	Good luck to ya, whippersnappers!
42	tk1	In the meantime, we'll take custody of\nthe friends you contacted us about.
43	6	They're called Mwamba and Hackt...\nWhat's gonna happen to them?
44	tk1	They're not quite back to themselves yet,\nright? We'll give them a checkup, make\nsure they're all there.
45	tk1	And after that, well, keep 'em under\nobservation I s'pose? Either way, you\ncan leave 'em with us.
46	C	We leave them in your able hands, then.
47	tk1	Yeah... Yeah, sure thing.\nThey'll be safe as houses.
48	tk1	I'll be in the war room.\nKeep me abreast of any developments.
49		Cammuravi has temporarily\njoined the party.

0	6	Well, it really is empty...
1	4	It's definitely Ethel's module.\nBut why would anyone want her...?
2	5	If we wanna know that,\nwe just gotta catch 'em.
3	5	And whaddya know, they\nleft us a clue. Nice of 'em.
4	2	There's footprints all over the place...\nThey seemed to be in a rush.
5	6	They're not Ethel's, are they?\nBut then, whose...?
6	1	We only have to follow them to find out.\nThey can't have gone too far.
7	1	Let's get going.
evt/tq/msg_tq001107f.json
0	yk1	Mehhhh...\nWhat Cubibi do now...?
1	2	Um, excuse me...?
2	yk1	Meh-meh?!
3	yk1	C-C-Cubibi sorry, sorry, so sorry!
4	3	We haven't even said anything yet.
5	yk1	Cubibi know without saying!\nFriends come looking for\nnaughty boy Cubibi!
6	yk1	Cubibi never meant to do any harm...\nCubibi just...
7	yk1	Just want to enjoy game of\nUltimate Hide-and-Seek...
8	C	Hide-and-seek... What is that?
9	yk1	Is ultimate pastime of daringly go\nand hide where not allowed to go.
10	C	Daringly...? Defying a prohibition?
11	yk1	Meh-meh?!\nCubibi please asking\nto not make scary face!
12	4	So why did you open the cradle, then?
13	yk1	When get on panel, it open by self!
14	yk1	And when it open, girl wake up...\nCubibi really-truly sorry...
15	C	We get it now, so...wipe your tears.\nLook, you're getting your tummy wet.
16	C	And what happened afterwards?\nDid you go somewhere with the\nawoken soldier?
17	yk1	Cubibi get scared and\nflee from scene of hide...
18	yk1	But can tell morely or lessly\nwhere she go.
19	yk1	Cubibi think it direction of Centrilo Parade.
20	C	I am the morning mist in a pine grove...\nI am mythrice, growing across seasons...
21	yk1	...Meh? Friend OK?
22	2	Don't mind him, he's just, ah...\ntrying to maintain his cool.
23	6	I updated Travis on the situation.\nHe says he's coming to collect Cubibi.
24	yk1	Is Cubibi in serious troubles...?
25	2	I don't expect him to be too severe,\nbut you will need to do some repenting.
26	yk1	Mehmehmeh...
27	1	Let's leave Cubibi in Travis's hands,\nand go track down Ethel.
28	1	She looks quite distinctive. Someone on\nCentrilo Parade should have noticed her.
29	C	...You are right.
30	C	Yes... Let us go.

0	4	Now comes the tricky part.\nWhat do we do from here?
1	5	What can we do, except foster her\nin the City? A first-termer won't be\nany use in a fight...
2	C	Do you find that acceptable?
3	dn1	...I don't know.
4	C	I have a proposal.
5	C	Would you leave her with me for a while?
6	2	Wait, you're saying you wanna\nlook after Ethel?
7	C	Just until she settles on her own path.
8	C	I want her to have that freedom.\nI don't know why...but I feel it strongly.
9	1	For now, let's see what Travis thinks.
10	1	As the City's concerned too,\nwe shouldn't decide alone.
11	C	Travis... I fear we will wear him out again.
12	5	It's not fatigue that that guy struggles with...
13	5	...You know what, forget it.\nMaybe just don't say that to him, yeah?
14	5	He's kinda touchy about it.
15	C	I understand. I will mind\nmy ways around him.
evt/tq/msg_tq001110f.json
0	tk1	Ahh. Well, I guess I...mostly understand.
1	tk1	Are you sure you can\nhandle child-rearing?
2	C	Child-rearing...? What is that?
3	tk1	In a nutshell, I'm asking if you're capable\nof taking responsibility for the proper\nupbringing of this little princess.
4	dn1	I'm not "princess". My name is Ethel.
5	tk1	Awhaha... Too precious.
6	C	If you would consent to it,\nI will serve for the good of the City.
7	C	I am sure I have my blind spots,\nbut I always complete the duties\nassigned to me.
8	dn1	I'll help too.
9	C	...Hm? But you cannot fight.
10	dn1	I can be your eyes, though.
11	dn1	I can see that which you cannot.\n...No?
12	C	By the flames... Spirited, isn't she?
13	tk1	Oh yeah, too spirited I'd say.\nLook, lemme bend your ear a little...
14	2	You don't think it's going to work?
15	tk1	It's not really my position\nto think anything...
16	1	Right... Well, I'll try talking to Monica then.
17	tk1	Aughh! OK, fine fine fine,\nI get it! Let's do this.
18	tk1	I'll take care of Ethel, and instead,\nwe'll have Cammuravi help out on\nthe combat side!
19	tk1	That'll be perfect, don't\nyou think? Eh? Eh?
20	1	You're that scared of Monica?
21	tk1	Oh, I'm scared all right! But I'm not just\ntrying to cover it up from sheer terror, OK?
22	tk1	It's just...that woman takes on way more\nthan she should. I bet she doesn't know\nhow to take it easy.
23	tk1	So I figured, you know, I'd lighten her load\nby doing this much at least.
24	C	...Your Warrior's Way is unimpeachable, sir.
25	C	I will never forget your kindness.\nBe sure, the debt will be repaid.
26	tk1	Oh yeah? Well, make it hundredfold, then.
27	dn1	Don't get greedy, Trav.
28	tk1	Oh, we're doing nicknames now?\nHow about we start with "Lieutenant\nTravis" and go from there, eh?
29	C	I am deeply indebted to you all as well.
30	2	Don't sweat it.
31	C	No, this is truly a grave debt.\nEspecially...
32	C	Taion...
33	C	You said I should live true to myself.\nI haven't discovered exactly what that\nmeans yet...
34	C	But now I understand what you meant\nat least, and am grateful to you for setting\nme on the right path.
35	C	You were the source of the spark\nthat set my flame alight. Thank you.
36	4	Erm...
37	2	...Taion, he's talking to you.
38	4	I know... I just never in my life thought\nI would be on the receiving end of this\nkind of speech.
39	4	The future... Really, it is a foreign country.
40	2	Huh... I suppose it is.
41	4	I'm sure in time you and Ethel will find it.\nThe right path, the right code to live by.
42	C	Yes...
43	C	Until such time, I, Cammuravi,\nremain ready to do battle for the City,\nand for you as well.

1	tk1	Boss, don't spread that gossip, will ya?\nI gotta keep up my reputation as the City's\nmost eligible bachelor.
2	D	Oh, is that right? Well, might be\nmy memory's playing tricks...
3	D	Anyway. I heard the child's a spirited one.\nEnough to try piloting a Levnis by herself.
4	tk1	Hahah, no way...\nThat would require some real talent...
5	D	It would, wouldn't it?\nWe should have a nice, long chat\none of these days, Travis.
6	tk1	Urk...
7	D	Or would that inconvenience you?
8	tk1	Ah, no, why would you say that...?\nI'd be...all too happy.
9	D	Heh... I'll look forward to it, then.\nI can tell we'll have a lot to talk about.
evt/tq/msg_tq001200s.json
0	1	We've been through a lot since we\nsettled on getting to the City, huh?
1	1	But we all made it through in one piece.\nThat's something to be thankful for.
2	2	Yeah!
3	2	We're seeing a world that we've\nnever known before, experiencing\nit for the first time.
4	2	I just wish I could have let Guernica\nknow that too.
5	4	If it wasn't for him, we'd have been\ncut down right where we stood.
6	3	Yup. Or maybe just ended up\nblindly killing each other in battle\nlike every other schmuck.
7	6	I'm glad it didn't come to that.
8	5	Yeah, think about it.
9	5	What the old man gave us...\nIt was immense.
10	3	But in the end, we won't know a flippin'\nthing about the guy, will we? Kinda sucks.
11	3	I mean, it's pretty late in the day.\nBut I really wanna know more about him.
12	2	I wonder what his motive was for\ngiving us this power.
13	2	No... In fact, I think we have\na duty to find out.
14	2	Because like him, we stand together\nwith the people of the City.
15	6	Seems all the City folk thought he\nwas a pretty awesome guy, huh?
16	6	Especially Monica... He was a really special\nperson for her, right?
17	4	Indeed. Monica was referring to him as\n"Dad", even.
18	4	It's a City custom. That's what they call\nthe person who raises them.
19	1	Perhaps we could ask Monica\nabout Guernica, find out what he\nreally thought.
20	1	After all, we're carrying his dreams now,\nfighting to make them real.
evt/tq/msg_tq001201f.json
0	1	Monica! Can we talk?
1	D	What's up? Sounds ominous.
2	1	We were hoping we could ask you about\nsomeone... Guernica, in fact.
3	D	...About Dad?
4	2	Everyone in the City\nspeaks so highly of him.
5	2	But we still don't know a whole lot about\nhim. I think we owe him that much.
6	D	All right. Where do you wanna start?
7	1	You were brought up by him, right?
8	1	So...we thought you'd probably understand\nhim better than anyone else.
9	D	Hah. I wish that were the case.
10	D	The Guernica Vandham that I knew,\nwas a man that I always looked up to.
11	D	He was always busy keeping the City\ntogether, or fighting out on the front line...\nAlways distant...
12	D	After I chose a military life, he didn't even\ntalk to me like a parent any more.
13	1	You mean...you weren't\non very good terms?
14	D	I got to know the man, I think.\nBut not the father.
15	D	I just thought...that we'd have more\ntime together...
16	1	...
17	tk1	'Ey, Boss...
18	tk1	You're making the kids feel guilty...
19	D	Ah, sorry.
20	D	I don't blame you guys for any of this.
21	D	Dad...Guernica...died in the line of\nduty, trying to accomplish his aim.\nBut that's not all.
22	D	He died fighting for what he\nbelieved in. And he saw it through.\nOf that much I'm sure.
23	2	For what he believed in...
24	tk1	Well, about that... There still might be\na bit of unfinished business there.
25	tk1	He sure was adamant about getting\nstuff home to people.
26	D	Yeah... For certain.
27	2	Sorry, what do mean exactly?
28	tk1	Personal effects, from the deceased.\nThings that family and friends can\nremember them by.
29	tk1	We don't leave any other mark behind\nthat says "we were here", you see.
30	tk1	If there are people waiting for you,\nthen you just want to leave something\nbehind, whatever it may be.
31	tk1	I was in the rear guard. I know just how\ndangerous that battlefield was.
32	tk1	Maybe it's better not to dwell on that.
33	1	...
34	1	But...there are personal items that have\nbeen left behind though, right?
35	tk1	Huh?
36	1	Maybe...you'd let us do something\nto help out with that.
37	1	It must be really painful for the people\nwho never got the chance for closure.
38	3	Yeah, right?
39	3	I'm starting to get a handle on how\nthey see things in the City. Sort of...
40	6	But if there's something we can do\nabout it, I wanna try to help.
41	D	I appreciate the sentiment, guys.\nBut why go to all this trouble?
42	4	Well, we'll get some closure from\ndoing this too.
43	4	We were losing friends every day.
44	2	And before we became Ouroboros,\nsome of us used to be off-seers.
45	2	Guernica went to all that\ntrouble for others.
46	2	And when it happened...he was thinking of\neveryone waiting for him in the City.
47	2	So I'd like to help his voice find its way.
48	D	...
49	tk1	Much appreciated... Speaking\npersonally, good on ya.
50	D	Travis, could you pull up\nthe tactical register?
51	tk1	Roger that! Give me a moment.
52	tk1	There's the data.
53	tk1	We've got a list of deceased soldiers and\nthe likely locations where they fell.
54	tk1	Could you check out the waypoints\naround Alfeto Valley?
55	4	That's some impressive precision!
56	tk1	Kind of you to notice! See, that's\nthe thing about us Lost Numbers...
57	tk1	We just don't know when to quit!
58	D	Haha! OK, guys.\nIt's up to you now.
59	D	When you're done, could you meet me\nat the Remembrance Stones?

1	tk1	Thanks. Means a lot.
2	tk1	Can you...lay them out here?
3	6	Now you mention it... Didn't Monica\nput an eyepatch here...?
4	3	Yeah. That was Guernica's.
5	4	What does it mean exactly?\nPlacing people's belongings here?
6	tk1	Uhh, how can I explain it...? Erm...
7	tk1	You guys have off-seeing, right?\nI guess this is our version of that.
8	2	Off-seeing for City folk... Hmmm...
9	D	You got here first.
10	tk1	Boss! We were waiting for you.

15	wl1	I just wish that...we could have\ntalked more.

7	F	Oh.
8	1	Oh.
9	F	Wh-wh-wh-wh-what are you guys\ndoing here...?
10	1	W-we just... Uh... What are you...?
11	2	Erm... Majesty...your clothes...
12	F	W-wait! Just hang on!\nGive me a second here, all right?
13	F	Whoo... Ahem.
14	F	Well met, all of you.\nPlease accept my heartfelt welcome.
15	F	I can offer you only a simple\nwelcome today, but do please\nmake yourselves comfortable.
16	1	...
17	F	Is something the matter?
18	1	...Doesn't it wear on you, acting like that?
19	F	Wh-what?
20	2	Ah... Noah!
21	F	No. It's perfectly fine.\nDispense with such concerns!
22	F	Pray, let not my regal status prohibit\nyou from presenting your enquiries.\nPlease, speak your minds.
23	3	All right, well, here's a question...\nWhat's that get-up all about?
24	F	Ah...ah yes. Perhaps you would\nfind my clothes rather...curious.
25	3	I mean...if you don't want to talk about it,\nthat's cool, no sweat.
26	F	Oh! N-no, it's nothing like that...
27	F	Before, I told you all how the world\nwas once divided into two, if you recall?
28	1	Yes, you told us when we first met.\nHow could we forget that, your Majesty?
29	F	These clothes belong to that era.\nWhen the worlds were two, unmingled.
30	F	These raiments were created specially\nfor me in that older realm.
31	2	So... So they're from your\nold world, Majesty?
32	F	Right. I suppose you could call it\na keepsake of my motherland, if you like.
33	4	"Motherland"...? Can you\nexplain that word, please?
34	F	The place of my coming into existence in\nthe world, of my infancy and upbringing...\nWe called that our "motherland".
35	1	Your Majesty's motherland...\nWhat kind of place could it have been?
36	F	Are you interested, Noah?
37	1	I am... The subject seems so huge,\nI can scarcely begin to imagine it.
38	1	If it please you, I'd love to hear more\nabout your world, Your Majesty.
39	F	Certainly, I'd be happy to.\nWell, to begin with, I ought to explain...
40	F	...Actually, now that I think it over...
41	F	...if I were to tell you the whole\nof the story, a full day and night\nmight not suffice, I fear.
42	F	In fact, I'm certain of it.
43	1	Oh, I see! Then I'm sorry to have made\nsuch an unreasonable demand of you.\nWell, maybe another time then...?
44	F	Even then... Surely you have important\nmatters you ought to be taking care of.\nIt won't do for me to detain you here.
45	1	Huh? Well, I suppose so, but...
46	F	Therefore, let us go forth together!
47	1	Yes, Your Majesty. As you wi-
48	1	...Wait.
49	4	Ah, forgive me, Your Majesty,\nI don't think we quite heard right.
50	F	I mean to say, that I will accompany you\non you travels.
51	F	That way, I'll be able to continue my tales.\nNight and day, every day, if needs be!
52	F	Ah... I mean, that is not NOT to imply\nthat being cooped up here the whole\ntime is as lonesome as it is tedious...
53	F	...or that I'm well pleased with myself\nfor inventing an elegant, way-sneaky\nexcuse to get out...
54	F	It's nothing like that at all...\nPlease, do not misinterpret it thus.
55	5	No one was saying that anyway...
56	F	Uhm... I suppose it may be\na bit much, eh...?
57	1	Uh, we weren't saying that, either...
58	F	All right then, it's decided!\nA "deal", shall we say?
59	1	Y-yes, Your Majesty...
60	F	...Aw yiss!
61	1	OK, then...uhm...\nWe humbly beg your grace, Your Majesty.\n...Or was that "respectfully"...?
62	F	Oh, come now! No need for such formality.\nI ask only for your kind support, Noah.
63	F	Oh... And from now on,\nI'd like you to address me simply as "Nia".
64	F	From now on, I'll be just another one\nof your ordinary fellow traveling-folk!
65		Travel Aionios with Nia\nand discover special events\nacross the world!

5	G	(sigh) Did it fail?
6	Zf1	I understand how you feel, but you\nmust think of your own well-being!
7	Zf1	Please...have patience, I beg you!
8	G	Surely I've been patient enough.
9	G	Stuck there in Origin, it's enough\nto send one insane.
10	2	Um... Can we help you?
11	Zf1	Her Majesty is insistent that she explore\nthe outside world undercover...
12	G	I wanted to see for myself what the beings\nof this world thought, what they needed.
13	G	Until now, all I could do was perceive\ndata... But no longer.
14	Zf1	I know, yes, but...if you simply\ngave us the order, we could\nperform all the legwork for you...
15	G	There are things you can't understand\nunless you experience them for yourself.
16	ho1	Then at least allow us to accompany you!
17	G	If I go with you, won't\nthat draw attention?
18	1	How about if we went with you?
19	1	We're quite well-traveled around\nAionios now. There are plenty of places\nwe could show you around, I'm sure.
20	2	And of course, we share a common goal.
21	2	There are people out there living\nin the harshest conditions, yet still\nthey struggle on.
22	2	We want to help them all too, just like you.
23	G	You want to help?
24	9	More people makes for more merries!
25	9	Would be mega merries with more Melia!
26	4	Manana, you must refer to Her Highness\nin the proper manner.
27	9	Manana speak improper?\nOh, that right. Many sorries, Melly!
28	Zf1	M-Melly?!
29	4	Please, Your Highness,\nforgive our insolence!
30	9	Taion did a boo-boo?
31	4	*I* didn't.
32	G	Haha... It's been a long time\nsince anyone called me that.
33	G	Then I have a proposal.\nThey will be my only guards.
34	Zf1	Your Majesty, why must you do this?\nWhat necessitates it?
35	Zf1	You have only just returned!
36	Zf1	You are the hope of all Keves!\nShould the unthinkable happen, then-
37	G	You're such a fusspot, Aizel.
38	G	But I want you to understand. The future\nis not shouldered by me alone.
39	G	It's something that is created by\neach and every person in the world.
40	G	I never wanted to sit there\nin my ivory tower and gaze\ndown from on high.
41	G	That's not the kind of ruler I am.
42	Zf1	I apologize. I spoke out of turn.
43	G	I'm not criticizing you.
44	G	You are what I wanted. You are my hope.
45	G	I have a request -\nor rather, something to discuss.
46	G	Could I ask you to take a fellow\ntraveler under your wing?
47	G	Her name is Melia.
48	4	If that's...truly what you wish for.
49	1	I don't see why not.\nGlad to have you with us, Melia.
50	5	Talking to the Queen on equal footing...\nThat's crazy, mate!
51	6	Yeah, I'm gonna feel so awkward...
52	8	No need for stress. Just act natural.
53	9	Stomach of Manana getting rumbly!
54	8	...Maybe some stress for Manana.
55	G	Ahaha!
56	G	What's wrong?
57	3	Our wings...
58	3	Your High-
59	3	Sorry... I still can't believe you\nhave them too, Melia.
60	3	Makes me feel special.\nLike we're the same.
61	G	Right. We are the same.
62	Zf1	Your Majesty...
63	Zf1	I urge you, please take care...
64	G	I'll be relying on you in my absence, Aizel.
65	G	I'm sorry to saddle you all\nwith me, everyone.

1		But, this is the route Ethel told us to take, no question.
2		Well, I guess that means...
3		We'll just, uh...have to keep going then.

5		Huh? Outside the colony.
6		\\[Well yeah, I know that!\\]
7		\\[It's bad. The Consul's searching for you.\\]
8		Gotcha.

10		\\[Sorry? "Make up"?!\\]
11		Let's look for a place we can climb from.\nI'll take a look around here.

13		Oh, crap.
14		Guys, get back!

16		That was close call!\nAlmost flattened like buttery pancake!
17		Ah, sorry.

20		Factually untrue.\nManana is just Manana.

0	H	Whoa. The joints are all burned out...\nAnd the state of this armor...
1	H	Hey, show me that again!
2	5	Show you what?
3	H	Those moves you pulled!
4	H	I've never seen anyone smash up\na Levnis like that! I need to figure out\nhow you guys managed to do it.
5	8	Nothing to observe.
6	8	Frame was structurally poor. Evident that\ndriving wheel could not withstand torque.
7	H	The driving wheel, you say...
8	H	I wonder if it's because it was\nupgraded from lightweight to a\nmore heavy assault style?
9	H	Did I mess up the handling? But the armor\nhad to withstand a charge, I had to fudge\nthe weight to keep a good turning circle...
10	8	...
11	H	Yes... You're absolutely right!
12	H	I can't believe you could tell\nwith just one look! Hey, would you\nteach me everything you know?
13	8	Noah...
14	1	Uh... Who exactly are you?
15	H	Oh, I'm Valdi. Levnis builder\nfrom Colony 30!
16	H	I heard that anyone who defeats you\ngets a whole buttload of supplies from the\nCastle as a reward...
17	H	But eh, you won,\nso it's all good.
18	5	Oh yeah, everything's just hunky-dory!\nWhat the snuff are you playing at?!
19	H	Not playing anything!
20	1	You're really a mechanic?\nFrom Colony 30?
21	1	Who's the commander for that one again?
22	H	Oh yeah, that would be me.
23	5	Pull the other one!
24	H	Wow, don't look so surprised!
25	4	I did hear that Colony 30's commander\nwas the greatest mechanic in Keves...
26	H	Not sure I would say "greatest", but\nI am bonkers about Levnises!
27	ha106ha10	Valdi!
28	H0300	Hey, Yuzet!\nWhat's up?
29	ha104ha10	Surely that's my line?!
30	ha104ha10	The Levnis signal just cut out...\nWhat happened?!
31	H0300	Oh, it just got a bit bashed about.\nEverything's fine. I'll be back home soon.
32	6	You're going back alone?
33	H	Huh?
34	6	I... I was just wondering how\nyou expect to manage that.
35	H	Oh.
36	H	Oh, it's fine. The Colony's\nnot that far away.
37	H	I'll just cannibalize these bits and pieces\ninto a new Levnis, quick as you like.
38	2	That'd take so much salvaging...
39	H	Oh, huh.
40	H	...Ahaha, maybe I can't do it alone...?
41	1	...How did I know it would come to this?
42	5	Ehhh... Guess we'll do your grunt work.
43	5	All right, hit us. What's the shopping list?
44	H	You'd really help me?!
45	5	Well we're not gonna leave you\nalone to fend for yourself...
46	H	Thank you so much, large man!
47	5	Lanz, man. ...I mean, Lanz.
48	H	Then Lanz I shall call you!\nLet's get cracking!

0	H	Yeah... This is looking good!
1	H	But man, even so...
2	H	Seeing all this Levnis wreckage...
3	2	That's how battle always feels after.\nJust sad.
4	H	Yeah, pretty tragic.
5	H	Makes me wanna fix 'em all right back up.
6	5	Look here, you...
7	H	Listen... I had this injury once. It really did\na number on me, physically and mentally.
8	H	That's when my masterpon told me-
9	5	Wait, "masterpon"?
10	H	Oh, it's Nopon for "really great person"!
11	H	So anyway, my masterpon told me this:
12	H	"Be a friend to all, and an enemy of none."
13	6	Be a friend to all...?
14	H	Yeah. I guess after that...seeing wrecked\nLevnises got me thinking about stuff.
15	H	A little elbow grease and I could just\nget them back on their feet.
16	H	My pals here wouldn't want me to\ngive up on them either.
17	2	You're very sweet.
18	H	Ah, don't get me wrong.
19	H	It's just that as a mechanic, you can't start\ngetting moody just because something's\nbroken.
20	H	"Not all wars are fought on the battlefield,"\nright?
21	8	That gauntlet... Valdi built it by self?
22	H	This? My masterpon gave this to me.\nTo celebrate my recovery!
23	8	...
24	H	Caught your eye, has it?\nYou wanna see more?
25	8	No... No special interest.
26	H	C'mon, don't be shy now!
27	8	Riku is not shy!
28	5	What I'm getting from all this is that you\nreally like this "masterpon" of yours, huh.
29	H	Yeah. He was really harsh on me\nsometimes, but he was ten times the\nmechanic I could ever be!
30	9	If compare masterpon and Riku,\nwho is most excellent?
31	H	Hm, good question. I think that your\nfriend here has a keen eye.
32	H	You know, I would love to get to\nspeak with him...
33	8	Secrets of Riku are closely guarded.
34	H	You don't say! I can't wait!
35	8	...Friend even listening to Riku?
evt/tq/msg_tq001604f.json

1	H	There! I want the parts from that big guy!
2	9	Which big guy?
3	H	The Kevesi... Wait.
4	H	The damage to the leg here... I fixed this,\nnot long ago. It was from another colony...
5	H	Ahh!
6	9	This horrible...
7	H	Augh...
8	9	Valdi...OK?
9	H	I get it... So this is how my Levnises\nhave been treated...
10	5	Sorry to rush you, mate, but we don't\nhave time to be standing around.
11	H	Huh? What's happening?
12	2	Well, we are outlaws, so...

evt/tq/msg_tq001605f.json
0	1	What is this place?
1	H	It's just where I stored some\nof the junk I've picked up.
2	H	Can't keep it all at the colony.\nYou know how it is.
3	4	I see. So you're recycling the parts as you\ndeem necessary.
4	H	Yeah, the supplies from the Castle just\naren't gonna cut it.
5	H	We have a lot of very particular\nmechanics, and a lot of requests\nfrom the pilots to boot.
6	H	We even get commissioned to repair the\nLevnises from other colonies.
7	9	Seems like awful much effort for\nnot much reward...
8	H	Not true! We're having a blast with it!
9	H	Our Nopon are all highly skilled,\nand our lieutenant has a good head\non his shoulders.
10	H	So, uh...remind me... What was it\nwe were trying to do again?
11	5	Picking up parts!
12	H	Oh, yeah! Right!
13	H	Well...for the body, I'd need...
14	H	Ah! Something like this!\nYeah, that fits the bill.
15	3	Is this guy really cut out\nto be a commander?
16	2	He's a skilled mechanic for sure,\nbut I imagine he gives his aides quite\nthe headache...
evt/tq/msg_tq001606f.json
0	H	Thanks, guys. Looks like all the parts\nare accounted for.
1	H	This is enough to build a Levnis.
2	9	What wrong, Valdi?\nSpirits seem middling to low.
3	H	...
4	H	I thought that with a Levnis, I'd be able\nto protect my friends. That no one would\nhave to get hurt.
5	H	But...just building them and fixing them up\nisn't going to make life rosy again.
6	H	My pals just do as they're ordered.\nThey go out, they fight...and they\nhurt people.
7	H	And I'm the one responsible.
8	H	If you're gonna blame someone for causing\nall those casualties...blame me.
9	8	Valdi is doing perfectly normal job of\nmechanic. Issue of orders not your fault.
10	H	But...
11	5	This doesn't sit right with you, does it?\nSo make something new.
12	5	Why d'you always have to make stuff for\nfighting? Why not try a different tack?
13	H	A different tack...?
14	H	Like, a Levnis, but not\nequipped for combat...?
15	5	Obviously, I dunno the nitty-gritty, but I'm\nsure it's not totally off the table, right?
16	5	This ain't the time to give up. Right?
17	H	Uh...!
18	H	Yeah!
19	H	Lanz, you couldn't be more right.
20	H	I shouldn't be led by the whims of others\nwhen I make my sweet little mecha.
21	H	Thanks, Lanz, and all of you.
22	H	I'll be back in a jiffy!
23	H	It's done!
24	1	Wow. That fast, huh.
25	3	It's looking a little on the small side, no?\nIs that...how you wanted it?
26	H	Yeah! He wouldn't last long in\na real battle, but he can follow\nsimple commands.
27	H	Right now, his only directive\nis to take care of me.
28	H	But that's just fine. He's a good guy.
29	5	Right then. Guess our job here's done, so...
30	H	Yeah. Don't worry, I can get\nback home just fine on my own.
31	qW1	Oh, damn and blast.\nAnd I came all this way.
32	H	Ah!

34	qW1	Pleased to make your acquaintance,\nOuroboros.
35	qW1	Ah, fear not.\nI have no interest in stirring the pot.
36	qW1	I was simply curious as to why our\ndear Valdi hadn't returned.
37	qW1	You promised us you would build the\nultimate Levnis, did you not? How much\nlonger do you expect us to wait?
38	qW1	Ahh, you Agnian dogs...\nHow I shall delight in crushing you\nbeneath my boot!
39	H	About that...\nActually, I've decided to-
40	qW1	How many times must I say it?\nGames are for winning.\nThat's what matters!
41	qW1	Consider. If we were to lose the initiative,\n*we* would be the ones trampled beneath\n*their* boots!
42	H	Yes, but...
43	qW1	Ehhhhh... Valdi, my boy...
44	qW1	Who was it that said he'd be fine, so long\nas he could tinker away with Levnises?!\nBecause I clearly remember those words!
45	qW1	If you've got time to be flapping those lips,\nyou've got time to be working those hands.
46	qW1	Should you fail in your duty, I won't be\nheld accountable for what happens to\nyour friends in the colony...
47	5	Snuff you, arsehole! The more that\ncomes out of your gob, the more\nI wanna smack-
48	H	Understood. I'm heading back.
49	5	Valdi!
50	H	Don't worry.
51	H	I've made up my mind.
52	6	Ultimate Levnis, he said...\nI'm a little worried now.
53	4	It's unlikely to bode well for us. Ideally,\nwe'd want to prevent it being deployed\nin battle.
54	6	Oh yeah, there's that too... But I was more\nworried about how Valdi feels.
55	5	He said he'd made up his mind.
56	5	Doesn't sound like he's gonna be finishing\nhis ultimate anything to me. More like...
57	8	He want to destroy it.
58	5	Huh?!
59	2	It's going off on its own?

20	H	Levnises have always,
21	H	*always* protected the things I care about.
22	H	I'm so small and pathetic.
23	H	But they taught me that...that I'm worth something.

4	H	...
5	H	I'm sorry.
6	H	I... I couldn't do anything...
7	5	I wouldn't say that.
8	5	At the very least, this little guy got to live\nthe way you wanted him to.
9	H	...Well, I sure hope so.
10	H	Thanks. For rescuing me.
11	H	Next time, I'll be sure to give you\na tougher body, Mechafriend.
12	5	Mechafriend?
13	H	Gotta have a name, right?
14	H	This little guy isn't meant for battle.
15	H	He's a fellow companion...and a friend.
16	H	So yeah. Thanks, guys!
17	H	I'm not going to focus my efforts just on\nrepairing Levnises any more.
18	H	I'll be working hard to figure out\nthe best way to protect us all -\nin the truest sense!
19	H	Oh, but, uh... I guess that'd mean\ndoing something about all our\nFlame Clocks, huh...
20	1	About that...
21	1	We could always smash Colony 30's\nFlame Clock?
22	1	It'd mean that everyone in\nthe colony wouldn't have to\nfight any more. The Levnises too.
23	H	You can do that?!
24	1	We can.
25	1	I can't guarantee that things will go\nsmoothly for you after, though...
26	H	I wouldn't say things are going particularly\ngreat as they stand anyway.
27	H	If I can make a difference for people,\nand not just Levnises...
28	H	Let's do it. Let's make this happen!

4	5	How are you feeling? It's gotta sting, right?\nIt was a big deal for you.
5	H	Lanz, you seem more stung than me.
6	5	Come on, man, no.
7	H	I'm fine. I mean, sure, it's a big\nchange of perspective.
8	H	But like I said before, I'd already\nmade up my mind.
9	5	True that.

0	1	All right, what do we make of\nthis news, about Colony 9\npossibly being under threat?
1	3	Even if it's just a nasty rumor, I don't\nfancy leaving anything to chance...
2	2	I agree. If they really are up against\na large battalion, there could be a lot\nof casualties.
3	5	What I wanna know is,\nwhy now all of a sudden?!
4	4	It's just a theory, but I'd imagine\nthat they consider this a particularly\nopportune moment.
5	4	Striking when the enemy defenses\nare at their weakest is one of the oldest\ntricks in the book.
6	3	Hmm. Only thing that fits timewise is\nus becoming Ouroboros...
7	5	So what, are you saying it's our fault?
8	1	Well... It is possible.
9	4	In any case, they wouldn't be launching\nan attack on that scale without *some kind*\nof justification.
10	2	We should go and help them.\nIf we hurry, there might still be a chance.
11	6	Yeah. And we'd never forgive ourselves\nif we missed it.
12	5	OK, let's go and talk to the commander!\nIf we work together, we should be able to\nkeep casualties to a minimum.
13	3	I just hope they'll believe us...
14	1	If not, we can always try\na different approach.
15	4	Well, If that's settled, then I believe\nour next stop is Colony 9.
16	4	Though it would be far from ideal,\nwe may end up having to stave off\nthe enemy attack by ourselves...
17	1	Yeah, best be prepared.\nOh, and...
18	1	Sorry for getting you wrapped up\nin our affairs.
19	2	Don't worry about that now.\nLet's just do what we can.

9	3	Does that mean the old one...?
10	bX1	There was a change of command!\nSomeone had to take the fall for\nthe traitors.
11	aX1	They even dropped our colony rank...
12	aX1	We've been so pressed for food, we had\nto venture out this far. All because of you.
13	3	...Well, crap.
14	bX1	Go back. We'll take care of things here.
15	I	I can't allow that.
16	bX1	Just get going already!
17	1	...The Agnian battalion.
18	1	They're using terrain to cover\ntheir approach. Am I right?
19	I	...How do you know that?
20	1	I'm well aware that you don't trust me.\nI'm just speaking aloud here.
21	1	We'll intercept the enemy troops,\nengage them while they're still advancing.\nThey won't get their hands on the Colony.
22	1	You retreat and shore up your defenses.
23	I	What are you really after here?\nWhy is it you're fighting?
24	1	We're both in very different positions now.
25	1	But that doesn't have to mean everything's\nchanged between us.
26	bX1	Oh well done, a voice of reason.\nCome off it!
27	I	...Wait.
28	I	Change of plans. We're bringing them\nback to the colony.
29	bX1	What? Why?
30	hX1	You're handing them in to the Consul?
31	I	No... I'm integrating them into our force\nas the vanguard.
32	aX1	We're fighting with them?!\nMwamba died because of them!
33	I	We're up against a whole battalion.\nHardly the time for us to be picky.
34	I	It's also possible that Ouroboros have\ninstigated this attack themselves.
35	5	Ugh, you can't be serious!
36	I	You know exactly how serious I am.
37	5	Fire and sparks...
38	3	Hold up. Let's do as he says.
39	5	What? Why should we?
40	3	Just play along!
41	3	We'll be better able to help protect\nColony 9 if we're part of the plan.

3	hX1	Stay cool, Kite.
4	cX1	I'm always cool.
5	I	Tell us about Agnus's movements.
6	cX1	Right now, they're assembling their forces\non Everblight Plain.
7	cX1	They've stopped concealing themselves,\nwhich feels like cause for concern enough.
8	I	They're confident they have\nthe numbers for a full assault, then?\nOr perhaps it's a feint...
9	cX1	Or they're just a bunch of dolts who\nlike pretending they have a plan. Haha!
10	I	I'm not in the mood for jokes right now.
11	cX1	Hey, we need a little levity sometimes.
12	cX1	With enough food, we can draw this out.\nGive the word and we could even launch\na raid-
13	I	I told you, that's not going to happen.\nIt would cost us too many lives.
14	cX1	What then? Our troops are hungry,\nanxious, and quite frankly, more\npissed off by the hour.
15	cX1	You leave things like this and we're going\nto fall apart by ourselves.
16	1	...We could just remove their\nreason for fighting you.
17	cX1	What...?
18	I	In plain language, please.
19	1	If we smashed your Flame Clock,\nit would alter the equation.
20	I	If you "smashed it"...?
21	cX1	Uhh, what? Well now\nI know you're all jokers!
22	8	Kite biggest joker of all.
23	8	This why Kite always runner-up in life.\nNo one can take serious with hopeless\nsecond-best attitude!
24	cX1	Shut it, Riku! Y-you really know how to hit\na man when he's down, don't you?
25	cX1	Why are you back here, anyhow?\nHow'd you worm your way back\ninto Zeon's favor?
26	8	Meh... No worming performed...
27	cX1	We don't need you here! I've had enough\nof seeing my friends die, betray me...\nI can't deal with this dirt any more!
28	1	We feel just the same. Which is why\nwe want to do as much as we possibly\ncan to help.
29	1	That's why we came back.
30	cX1	Yeah, you're not fooling anybody.
31	I	You need not believe them.\nBut they will prove to be an asset.
32	cX1	Huh, so that's it?\nYou're siding with them in the end?
33	cX1	You choose Noah over your own\nlieutenant? Again?!
34	I	That's not what I'm saying.
35	cX1	Don't you realize how hard\nI'm trying here? ...Spark this!
36	1	Sorry. I didn't mean to complicate matters.
37	I	On the contrary, was this not\nyour intent? I would have thought\nyou'd be gloating by now.
38	1	We can gloat if it makes you feel better.
39	1	But you can't just judge someone\nin the heat of the moment.
40	I	...Whatever you might think,\nsuspicion will be cast upon you.
41	I	That is all I can say.
42	4	Suspicious or not, isn't it about time you\ntell us this plan of yours?
43	4	You said we'd prove to be an asset.
44	I	...I'll continue.
45	I	Though we have a geographical advantage,\nour provisions and numbers are limited.\nThat's what the enemy will be banking on.
46	I	And that's where you come in,\nas the vanguard.
47	2	Our sudden appearance will put a spanner\nin their works. And that'll give you the\nedge you need, right?
48	3	Seeing Keves and Agnus bods fighting\ntogether and tearing up their front line's\ngonna throw 'em off their game, for sure.
49	5	So we've gotta fight independently then.
50	5	Better than being on a leash, I s'pose.
51	I	You seem to misunderstand.\nI'm not cutting you loose...
52	I	You are still being regarded as traitors.\nKeep in mind that I shall be supervising\nyour every action personally.
53	5	Sir, yes sir, Commander sir.
54	3	Do you have to...?
55	1	Let it go, guys.

12	I	Oh, I'm sure.
13	I	There is no such thing as a traitor\nwho rebels without cause.
14	I	Be it Keves, or Agnus.
15	2	...
16	I	You've sent many of\nmy comrades off, Noah.
17	I	Time and time again, you saved the dead,\nhelped survivors... Even me.
18	I	I know you do not make light\nof people's lives.
19	1	So you understand?
20	I	I do. But I can never be the friend\nto you that I once was.
21	5	You don't give a cetri, do you?
22	I	I wasn't talking to you, Lanz.
23	5	'Scuse me?
24	1	Maybe we can't go back to the old days.\nBut we can build something new.
25	I	Leave your platitudes for after.\nThe battlefield awaits.
26	1	Don't worry, we'll win. No one's dying\non our watch. Never again.
27	I	Time to move. Stay sharp.
evt/tq/msg_tq001705f.json
0	1	There's a lot of them...\nThis'll be a battle of attrition.
1	1	We can use the terrain for\ndefensive advantage. First,\nwe need to hurt their morale.
2	I	Before that, we need to talk.
3	I	I'll remain here and fight for as long\nas I stand. That's also part of the plan.
4	I	It will be a grueling fight. I won't have time\nto be looking out for possible deserters.
5	3	Hold on, are you telling us to\nfind a chance to escape?
6	I	I never said that.
7	I	But this battle should be of little\nimportance to you.
8	5	Sparks' sakes, Zeon...\nJust how rotten do you think we are?
9	1	I see where you're coming from.
10	1	But we're fighting on our own terms.\nWe'll be seeing this through.
11	3	We owe a debt to Colony 9.\nMaybe it wasn't for very long, but\nit gave us somewhere to belong.
12	I	But not any more...
13	5	Just shut it, you!
14	5	How hard is it for you to accept\nsomeone just wants to do a good\ndeed, eh? Get a clue!
15	3	Lanz!
16	I	How often does he need telling not to\nabandon himself to his feelings?
17	1	Have you given in?
18	I	Hah.

9	I	I guess we will...
10	1	Don't let it get to you.
11	I	I wouldn't normally, but in this instance,\nI'm afraid he's struck a chord.
12	I	I believe I said something similar to you\nin the past. We were sparring with\ntraining swords.
13	1	You won, in the end.
14	I	I did. Because you always held back.
15	1	That's not true...
16	I	You hated the very idea of fighting.\nThat's how it seemed to me.
17	I	And back then, I thought that you'd never\nsurvive with that lofty ideal. I was blind.
18	I	If we don't stand for something greater,\nstrife and conflict will grow ever fiercer.
19	I	We would end up fighting not for the\nFlame Clock, but for our own bloodlust.
20	I	That is who we are.\nIt was never going to be easy.
21	1	Yeah... I'm still trying to figure out\nwhat's right myself.
22	1	But there's something I want to change.\nAnd to do that, I have to change myself.
23	I	Hah...
24	I	...Kite and the others pulled through OK.\nIt seems we've averted disaster, for now.
25	1	Not quite. There's still unfinished business.
26	1	Zeon, I want you to understand\nthe things we've seen. The truth\nabout the Flame Clocks.
27	1	Just let us explain. After that, we'll let you\nhave the final say.
28	I	As you wish. It also saves us an awkward\nsilence on the way back.
29	I	But don't get your hopes up.
30	1	That's fine. Thank you.

2		Where have you been?
3		Just watching from the sidelines.
4		And I must say, it was quite a spectacle.
5		Hm?
6		In what way?
7		Beg pardon.
8		I forget! You drones have no aesthetic sense.
9		Your droll skirmish was one thing...\nIt almost put me to sleep, but this here?
10		Well, I'd say the colony is due a promotion.
11		I recall no "droll skirmish".
12		The one where these maggots surfaced!
13		Loathsome little worms plotting together with Agnus,\nthen deserting their duty like the cowards they are!
14		Truly disgusting. A disgrace to the colony!
15		And that goes for the ones who croaked for nothing, too.
16		Even calling that "droll" is a disservice to the word!
17		"Croaked for nothing"...?
18		I know you see us as enemies...
19		But this...?
20		It's our friends you're talkin' about...
21		Even Mwamba, back then...
22		How dare you?!
23		Silence, maggots!

4		Even so...the choice is mine.
5		Lay things out for me here, Commander.
6		Our Consul's a monster.
7		Our Flame Clock's busted.\nWe still don't have enough food to go round.
8		I have to ask...\nWhat was the point of all this?
9		We succeeded.
10		Though not quite the way I'd hoped.
11		Now then, listen.
12		Y-you can't be serious.
13		Then what, it was all a sham?
14		So it would appear.
15		For that reason, we need to learn as much as we can.
16		About ourselves.
17		And about the world outside.
18		Oh, is that everything?\nAnd while eating shoe leather?!
19		If need be.
20		Whatever the outcome may be,
21		only we can change it.
22		I believe that.
23		We'll help you out too.
24		Not because we're looking for your acceptance.
25		But just so everyone can live.
26		So please, let us further your goal.
27		I know you still have doubts,
28		but won't you give them a chance?
29		I confess, I'm still a bit dazed by\nthese developments...
30		But...I could let them off.
31		Yeah, same.
32		The commander's never quite\nbeen this insistent.
33		If Mwamba were here, I think he'd\nhave agreed much sooner...
34		Friends...
35		Well, I'm still not buying it.
36		The one to make the call, should be me.
37		I should decide! Nobody else.
38		I'll prove it.
39		The only one fit to be commander...\nis me.
40		We're gone.
41		Man, way to go off on one...
42		Kite, he just worries for the colony.
43		He will come round eventually.
44		So? What's the word now, boss?
45		First, I want to solve the food shortage.
46		What, you mean...by taking long hikes?\nIt'll be tough, without anything nearby.
47		That was the case up until now.
48		Myself, I'll try it the other way.
49		What way?
50		We'll make fields.
51		Our own food supply, grown with our own hands.
52		When he says fields, does he mean like\nthat bit in the textbook?
53		"When food is scarce, one may till\nthe soil and plant Glitter Radishes."
54		You always know your stuff.
55		Obviously.
56		I see. It was difficult to find time before,\nsince you had to worry about the Flame Clock.
57		Yes, but not any longer.
58		Heh. You're giving it a go then?
59		There will be toil, but we'll try.
60		Then...start by observing\nthe vegetation.
61		It's not just soldiers that want to survive\nout here. You're sure to learn something.
62		I understand. We'll try that.
63		Oh, and...if you're ever in need\nof my support, just call on me.
64		I'll help.
65		That's appreciated, but...
66		are you really sure?
67		If you truly want to change something,
68		you must start with the self.
69		I believe you said that.
70		Still, some folks aren't gonna like you,\nwhen you're palling around with us lot.
71		It doesn't matter what they think of me.
72		What truly matters, is whether\nI carry out my duty.
73		Zeon...
74		You haven't changed at all.
75		Sarcasm?
76		At this stage?
77		Not at all.
78		I was just thinking that...\nyou're still the same old friend from back then.
79		You've gained a way with words.
80		I see. Perhaps people *can* change.
81		Wow, ouch!
82		Hahahaha!
83		You gave us strength.
84		Thank you.
85		Thank *you*.

1	vZ1	They say there's an Agnus battalion\non the march, and they're using the\nterrain as cover...
2	vZ1	I really don't like the sound of that.\nEspecially considering what's over\nthat way...
evt/tq/msg_tq001800f.json
0	1	Look...!
1	6	Oh! Mimi!
2	6	That's Kyrie from Colony Gamma!
3	2	What?!
4	3	Friend of yours?
5	2	Yes... But the story\nwill have to wait.
6	1	OK! Let's give her a hand!
evt/tq/msg_tq001801f.json
0	2	You OK? You're not hurt?
1	WY1	Mi-
2	2	Kyrie?
3	WY1	Mioooooo!!!
4	WY1	You're in one piece?!\nThank you so much for saving me!\nI'm so glad you're alive!
5	4	Yes, yes, no need to get so excited.
6	WY1	Ahhhhh, I'm so sorry!\nI'll calm down! Deep breaths...
7	2	What are you doing here, Kyrie?\nColony Gamma is-
8	WY1	Oh! Well...actually...
9	2	...You got separated\nfrom your unit again?
10	WY1	I'm so sorry! I just have no\nsense of direction at all!
11	6	Never change, Kyrie!
12	1	She's...interesting, isn't she?
13	5	Interesting, a pain in the neck...\nSame difference, I s'pose.
14	WY1	Sooo, Mio, those other people...?
15	2	Don't worry about them. They're my\nfriends. And they helped save you.
16	WY1	Ah, so they did! Thanks again, Mio.
17	3	Why "thanks Mio"?!\nWhat are the rest of us, Armu steak?!
18	6	Leave it, that's just Kyrie.
19	WY1	Mio, let's hurry back to the\ncolony! I bet the commander\nwill be pleased to see you too!
20	2	Yeah, about that...\nCan I have a quick word?
21	WY1	Of course! What about?!
22	2	This is an odd question, but...\nWell. How do we look to you?
23	4	Ah...!
24	WY1	How do you...look?\nWell, let me see...
25	2	...
26	WY1	Ah-HA!
27	2	Hm?
28	WY1	Yep, no good at all! You can't just\nchange your clothes as you please!\nThat's against regulations!
29	WY1	Hmm, but they suit you so perfectly!\nI mean, your off-seer outfit suited you\nto a T as well, but I mean...
30	2	Thanks, Kyrie, that's all I needed.
31	WY1	Happy to help!
32	2	I just need to discuss something\nwith everyone. Mind waiting?
33	WY1	No problem!
34	2	...She seems in her right mind,\nanyway. No glowing Iris.
35	6	Just classic Kyrie.
36	4	But does this mean we don't look\nlike hostiles to everyone...?
37	1	Let's not worry about that for now.\nWhat should we do with her?
38	2	That's the question.
39	2	I want to take her back to the\ncolony if we can... But can we?
40	6	We can't send her out on her own.\nIt's dangerous, and she'd definitely\nget lost again...
41	5	Fine with me, but would she be OK\nhanging out with us Kevesi?
42	2	...It's possible that the commander of\nColony Gamma would hear us out.
43	2	At least, he isn't the type to turn around\nand capture people without warning.
44	3	Can we trust him?
45	4	Better than the Consul.\nTrust me on that.
46	1	If both of you are willing to go that far,\nthen he seems worth meeting.
47	2	...Thank you.
48	2	If anything happens, I'll do everything\nI can to keep you all safe. I promise.
49	2	Thanks for waiting.\nLet's go, Kyrie.
50	WY1	Ready, Mio!

2		Good job sticking it out, Sena.
3		We were pretty sure you were dead.

13		You're...
14		It's wonderful to see you again.
15		I'm truly sorry, Commander Teach.\nWe never meant to-
16		The details can wait till later.
17		I'm sure you'd appreciate a rest, no?
18		I imagine getting here was...\nby no means a simple task.
19		Am I right?
20		...Yes.\nWe appreciate your concern.
21		And as for our visitors here...
22		We can make our introductions later.

0	1	He was kind of strange.\nQuiet, but I could feel something\nthreatening in him...
1	3	Yeah, are you sure about this?\nHe didn't even question us.
2	4	Perhaps he's already worked it out.\nDecided we're not hostile.
3	5	Well, no one's attacked us.\nWhich is more than we can say for...\npretty much every other time.
4	6	Mimi, once we're rested up,\nhow about we tour the colony?
5	2	Good idea. I wanna see\nhow everyone's doing.
6	6	And we can show the Kevesi\nfolks around while we're at it.
7	3	Much obliged.\nWe are just visitors, after all.
8	4	I want to have a chat with the\nsoldiers too. There are a couple\nof things I'm curious to know.
9	1	So this is your old colony, Mio.\nLet's see what kind of place it is.
evt/tq/msg_tq001805t.json
0	WY1	Hi, Mio! Do you need something?
1	2	Kyrie, while we were away,\nnothing...strange happened, did it?
2	WY1	Ummm, not that I can think of?\nJust training as normal, and-
3	WY1	Oh! Actually!
4	2	Something happened?
5	WY1	A monster showed up!
6	2	...Monster? What?
7	WY1	So apparently, this monster showed up\nat the site where you vanished.
8	WY1	The frontliners sent word, but we\nlost contact right after that...
9	WY1	And because you vanished as well,\neveryone just kind of assumed\nwhatever it was had got you.
10	WY1	Ugh... Even just remembering\nit freaks me out all over again.
11	2	...
12	WY1	Oh, but you're back safe and sound,\nso I guess there was no monster at all!
13	2	...Right, yes. At least, not that we saw.
14	WY1	Right! I'm so glad!
15	2	A monster... Surely it couldn't be...
16	WY1	...You know what's even more\nscary than that monster business?\nThe commander's teaching methods.
17	WY1	Uh... Just don't tell him I said that!
evt/tq/msg_tq001806t.json
0	cY1	Ha, naturally, as soon as you get back\nyou want to see what's been going on.
1	4	Then let's cut to the chase.\n...Has anyone else come back besides us?
2	cY1	...I'm afraid not. Just you. The soldiers\nwho were on the front line are still MIA.
3	4	(shudder) ...I see.
4	cY1	That whole operation was\nriddled with weird stuff, though.
5	cY1	I asked the commander for the particulars\nbut it's all classified. He couldn't say.
6	cY1	Don't suppose you know\nanything about it, Taion.
7	4	...Sorry. No.
8	4	The allied soldiers who attacked us,\nall missing, fates unknown...
9	4	What if it's like Hackt...?\nIf they... Ugh!
10	cY1	I'm sure the commander has an idea...
evt/tq/msg_tq001807t.json
0	XY1	Whoa! If it isn't Mio,\nTaion and little Sena!
1	6	Wow, watch your tone! Why am I\nthe only one you're rude to?!
2	XY1	Forget about that. How about\nfacing me in a little mock combat?
3	XY1	Recently all we're doing is\nstanding by, so I'm getting soft.
4	6	Standby is an important duty!\nDon't complain.
5	XY1	Don't patronize me. I want\nto go to the front for once.
6	XY1	Wanna rack up some points in combat,\nmaybe become commander one day!
7	XY1	Like, why the snuff are they still\ntreating us like reserves? As if\nthis were the time for it.
8	XY1	Now that we lost most of our\nexperienced personnel, there's only\nus left to do what needs doing.
9	6	Huh...? You lost them?
10	XY1	That's right.\nVanished without a trace.
11	6	...
12	XY1	So, will you be my opponent?
13	XY1	It's your job to make sure we\nrookies are trained right, you know.
evt/tq/msg_tq001808f.json
0	6	Looks like our friends are\ndoing just fine, Mimi!
1	2	Seems so...
2	3	Still, there's a lot fewer soldiers\nhere than I expected.
3	2	...
4	4	A lot of the soldiers employed on that\nmission haven't come back yet. No one\nknows what became of them.
5	5	The mission where we became\nOuroboros, yeah?
6	4	I daresay that's the one...
7		
8	3	...Sorry. Should've kept my mouth shut.
9	2	No, you didn't do\nanything wrong, Eunie.
10	4	All the soldiers left in the colony are\nnewbies with no combat experience.
11	4	Right now they've been ordered\nto stand by as a reserve force.\nFar from the front lines.
12	2	A good thing, too. That's what saved Kyrie\nand others' lives. Plus, they didn't get to\nlearn the truth about us, and the world...
13	2	But...
14	5	Ugh... It doesn't sit well with me to\npretend like everything's fine, though...
15	1	...Mio, would you mind talking to\nthis commander of yours, Teach?
16	2	About what?
17	1	Everything. Tell him thanks for\ntaking us in no questions asked.
18	4	Now, look. I know I said he was\ntrustworthy but-
19	2	No, Noah's right.
20	2	I was planning on telling him everything\nanyway, and if we're gonna talk, we may\nas well lay it all out sooner than later.
21	2	We can't just expect people to trust us\nwhile we hide the truth like this.
22	5	Yeah. Makes more sense than\nstaying and hiding.
23	2	Right.
24	6	The commander will understand, I know it.\nHe's crazy harsh, but crazy fair too.
25	3	Harsh? He didn't look it.
26	4	...Sometimes ignorance is bliss.
27	3	Pfft...
evt/tq/msg_tq001809f.json
0	J	Ah, how is everything?\nIf you still need to rest, then-
1	2	Commander, there's something\nelse I'd like to discuss with you.
2	J	Of course. You don't look like you've\ncome to just deliver a report.
3	J	Then, shall we relocate? That\nshould be more convenient for you.
4	2	Yes, that would be helpful, thank you.
5	J	Ah, yes.
6	J	I know a good place nearby.\nLet's talk there.
7	2	What?!
8	4	C-Commander, please!\nWe don't need to go th-
9	J	It has a beautiful view, and a\nparticular peacefulness about it.
10	6	How lovely! I'd love to see it!
11	4	...This is bad. This is all going south.
12	1	It's just a change of place.\nI don't get what the problem is.
13	2	...We'll regret this.
14	J	I'd rather not delay, but unfortunately\nI have some work left to do here.
15	J	Wait for me next to the training ground.\nI'll meet you as soon as I can.
16	2	Very well. We'll see you there.
17	J	They were outstanding soldiers.\nI'd go so far as to say they\nwere the pride of Agnus.
18	J	So, now they're traitors. People\nare mysteries. You can never\nreally understand them.
19	J	Don't you agree?
20	J	But I'm the commander. I can't\nlet my personal feelings get in\nthe way of my duty.
21	J	I will deal with them. You can\nleave the matter with me.
22	J	We can't afford to ignore anything\nthat might do our very world harm.
evt/tq/msg_tq001810f.json
0	J	Sorry to have kept you waiting.\nSo, shall we head out?
1	5	Yeah, so is this "good place"\nof yours far?
2	J	Hmm, I'd say reasonably near.
3	J	But the road is poorly maintained\nand slopes a lot. It might not be\nan easy journey.
4	3	Oh great, now I'm totally sold.
5	J	It all depends on how you walk it.\nOnce you get the hang of it, it's just\nlike strolling through a field of flowers.
6	J	If you don't mind, I can\nexplain on the way.
7	1	Well, in that case...
8	6	Sounds great!
9	2	...If it's reasonably close by.
10	4	We'd better get ready.
11		Teach has temporarily\njoined the party.
evt/tq/msg_tq001811f.json
0	J	Right. This is where it gets real.
1	J	First, imagine a stake.
2	J	The stake is hammered into\nthe ground. So deep that it\nbecomes one with the earth.
3	J	Now take that feeling, and that's\nhow you're going to take each step.
4	J	Your feet are the stakes, in this case.
5	1	Ummmm, I...guess I...?\nNo, I don't get it.
6	J	That's all you need to know for now.\nYou'll pick the rest up as you go.
evt/tq/msg_tq001812f.json
0	5	Are we... Are we there yet...?
1	J	About halfway now. Not long to go.
2	3	We have...very different ideas...\nof what "not long" means...
3	6	Come on, people! This is why\nyou need to lift more weights!
4	J	Sena, you know you can't hone your\nendurance just by lifting weights.
5	6	Oh... Are you sure?
6	J	The key to training is working the whole\nbody, rather than focusing too much on\nany one exercise.
7	J	I'm sure it's not a problem now, but\nkeep it up and you'll wear yourself out.
8	6	Oh wow, I see!
9	J	Hmm, not good though. I believe I already\ntaught you this in the past.
10	6	Gah! I'm sorry...
11	5	Look at you, all calm and cool...
12	J	Indeed. Because I train properly.
13	1	This is harder than I expected...
14	2	I said we'd regret this.
15	4	The commander is also the colony's\ninstructor, after all.
16	4	He seems mild-mannered\nenough at first glance.
17	4	But new recruits are terrified of\nhim. They'd rather face a battle\nthan his wrath.
18	1	Huh...\nHm? Taion, are you OK?
19	J	You shouldn't slack off on your training\njust because you've seen real battle.
20	J	Whether you live or die on the battlefield\nis determined by how you face it. That's\nwhere it ends.
21	J	...Excuse me. I didn't mean to lecture.
22	2	You never change, Commander.
23	J	Ah, don't embarrass me.
24	1	You really do come across\nas an instructor.
25	J	Hahaha, I'll take that as a compliment.
26	1	It's pretty unusual for a commander\nto be an instructor as well, though.
27	J	Probably. In my case...\nWell, there's a lot going on.
28	2	What do you mean by that?
29	J	Just what I said.
30	J	Anyway, break time's over.\nLet's crack on.
31	5	Don't say thaaat...
evt/tq/msg_tq001813f.json
0	2	This is...
1	J	What do you think?\nA good place, isn't it?
2	J	It's peaceful, invigorating.\nA place to quiet your mind.
3	J	Even the war between Agnus and Keves\nfeels a world away from here, doesn't it?
4	2	Yes...it does.
5	J	I assume you know about\nthe state of Colony Gamma.
6	2	Y-yes. That's actually what I wanted to-
7	J	Then I can tell you that\nyou don't have to, Mio.
8	2	What do you-?
9	J	Don't you get it yet?
10	J	I mean that I'm going to deal\nwith you here and now.
11	1	Wha...? But you...!
12	J	Purging the traitor Ouroboros from our\nranks is a matter of the highest priority.
13	J	I am the commander of Colony\nGamma. I cannot shirk this duty.
14	J	Do you understand?
15	3	What, that you lured us out here to do\nus in? Yeah, I'm up to speed, thanks.
16	J	No one in the colony\nwill learn what you are.
17	J	Understand that the fact I'm not doing this\nin public is a sign of my respect for you.
18	2	But, Commander, wait!\nPlease, just listen-!
19	J	What would be the point? Words\nblur truth and lies so easily.
20	4	Commander...!
21	1	Ugh, we've got no choice...!
22	J	Are you prepared?\nFace your deaths with honor.
23	J	The time has come.
evt/tq/msg_tq001814f.json
0	5	Spark's sake! We can't take him down\nand he's just one guy?
1	4	I knew he had stamina, but this is...!
2	J	You too display impressive power.
3	J	But it's that power which is the cause of\neverything that's gone wrong, threatening\nthe lives of others as well as yourselves.
4	2	N-no, you've got it wrong! We-!
5	J	No. This isn't something\nthat only concerns you.
6	J	This power is a maelstrom\nthat surrounds the world.
7	J	A maelstrom eventually becomes a raging\ntorrent that swallows lives without mercy.
8	J	If you really know what's going on\nin Colony Gamma, then you must\nunderstand this.
9	2	That's...
10	J	So, tell me, Mio.
11	J	Was it the power of becoming\nan Ouroboros that drove you\nto the other side?
12	J	Were you reduced to merely\none part of a maelstrom?
13	2	No, you're wrong!
14	J	And what precisely am I wrong about?
15	2	We became Ouroboros by pure chance.
16	2	But we thought that with such\npower we'd be able to do more.
17	J	Hah. Do what?
18	2	Keep the world alive.\nFind new ways to use our lives for-
19	2	I don't know, I can't put it into words.\nBut that's what we want to use it for.
20	2	That's all I'm sure of.
21	J	Very pretty words.
22	2	We can only...\nWe can only go forward.
23	2	We want to find a way that doesn't\ninvolve sacrificing lives.
24	J	...
25	2	...
26	J	...Hmph. Looks\nlike I've misjudged.
27	2	What?
28	J	Well, you've heard for yourself.
29	J	I don't believe they are traitors.
30	J	In my capacity as commander,\nI judge them not deserving of death.
31	J	Are you in agreement, Consul?
32	1	The Consul's here?!
33	6	Ah!
34	5	So this is where you were hiding!
35	sW1	...What a lovely fiction. Bravo.\nThe fact remains, Ouroboros\nwill destroy the world.
36	J	But that's just one possibility.
37	J	Still, people can change.\nI choose to believe them.
38	sW1	Like the old you...?
39	J	Yes. I had no will, no resolution.\nOnly shame.
40	J	But they aren't me.\nThey will walk a different path.
41	sW1	...You shall persist no matter what?
42	J	You gave me a chance to fix it.\nI have an obligation.
43	J	So let's stop doing things your way.\nLet's end that here.
44	sW1	...Very well.
45	sW1	Then I shall make you and the traitors\nrecant your folly...
46	tW1	...with the power of Moebius!
47	2	Commander...!
48	J	Right, you lot. Time to walk the walk.
49	J	Prove that this power leads to light!
50	2	We will!

0	J	...
1	2	Commander, we-
2	J	...Not yet, Mio.
3	2	What?
4	J	It's not over yet.
5	J	There's one thing you still\nhave to do. Isn't there?
6	2	...There is.
7	J	Let's go back to the colony and\ndecide our next steps from there.

evt/tq/msg_tq001818f.json
0	2	Commander... You knew from the start.
1	J	Not at all. I was serious, Mio.\nI was ready to die to take you down.
2	1	So what you mean is,\nyou were testing us?
3	J	Such power can drive people mad.
4	J	I needed to be sure about you.
5	J	I needed to know you hadn't fallen into\nthe trap of being enthralled by power,\nthat you had retained your own will.
6	5	So that's why you had to try\nto kill us for real?
7	J	Determining the true nature of power\nis a kind of power in itself. That's how\nI do things.
8	5	You're...surprisingly violent.
9	2	But just one slip and you'd be...
10	J	I...once got to see how power can destroy\na person up close. I knew a soldier who was\nlost in it, and lost to it.
11	J	I don't want to see that happen to you.\nNor does anyone in the colony.
12	J	It was no choice at all to put\nmy life on the line to prevent it.
13	2	...
14	4	You're right that being an Ouroboros\ncomes with huge power, but it's full\nof danger too.
15	6	Yeah, but, we're fine?\nWe use it right, so...
16	J	...The reason I became an instructor was\nto teach people how to confront power.
17	J	But...there was always a niggling\ndoubt at the back of my mind.
18	J	That people are, at heart, stupid creatures\nthat power makes a mockery of.
19	2	That's...
20	J	But if you were to ask me whether\nI still thought that way, I'd say no.
21	4	So you have hope?
22	J	I do. Now that I've crossed\nBlades with you, I understand.
23	J	So...the maelstrom hasn't become a raging\ntorrent, but a clear, strong current.
24	2	Commander, if that's what you think,\nthen I'd like you to come with us.
25	J	Oh? And may I ask why?
26	2	I want you to see with your own eyes...\nthat your faith in us isn't misplaced.
27	2	You want something from us.\nMore than just words, right?
28	J	Yes.
29	J	The stream becomes the flow of life itself,\nbringing change and upheaval to the world.
30	J	And you want me to be the one to watch\nover your futures. That's it, isn't it?
31	2	Yes. Well, something like that.
32	J	Hm.
33	J	OK then. I'll do it.\nI accept the job.
34	J	But...what have those of you\nfrom Keves to say on this matter?
35	1	Yes, of course.
36	5	The more the merrier, especially\nif they're as strong as you.
37	3	Fine by me. Assuming we never\nhave to fight it out like this again.
38	J	Well, that all depends on\nhow well you train, doesn't it?
39	4	Ugh, why?
40	J	Hahaha, I was only joking.
41	J	Ah, before I forget. Mio.
42	J	I'd like to ask you a favor\nin return for this.
43	2	Anything.
44	J	Thank you. I'll run through\nthe particulars later.
45	J	...Oh, wait. I actually know a very\ngood place for talking. It's just-
46	2	Yea- Yeah, I think I'll pass on that part...

0	1	Looks like we managed to lose them.
1	3	Gah... What in Her Majesty's ever-loving\ncheekbones just happened back there?
2	4	Simply put, our foes were well-versed in\nthe art of war. Though their methods were\ninelegant, to say the least.
3	3	"Inelegant"? Like war's ever pretty.
4	2	They're efficient at stockpiling\ncombat rewards.
5	2	That's how they managed to climb\nto Silver rank already...
6	6	I heard they even share their supplies\nwith other colonies! That seems kind\nof awesome?
7	1	Sharing supplies?\nWhy would they do that?
8	2	It would prove beneficial\nin the long term...I think.
9	4	Creating debts to strengthen ties with other\nallied forces does open up your options,\ninsofar as battle tactics are concerned.
10	1	And if that leads to better results\nin combat, you can get your hands\non even more goods...
11	3	What I'm getting here is\nthat they're trouble...
12	4	Yes. And to make matters worse,\nAlexandria herself announced that\nthey will come for us again.
13	6	I bet us "traitors" would net them\na hefty reward, huh...
14	5	So how about we turn the tables\non 'em, punch *their* lights out?
15	3	Listen to yourself, you doofus.\nWe're talking Silver here, yeah?
16	4	...Well, whatever we choose to do, here's\nsomething to bear in mind: Colony Iota's\ncommando group is made up of four units.
17	4	Regardless of the precautions we take,\nwe've a high chance of encountering them.\nWe should consider our approach carefully.
18	1	Well, in that case...
19	1	In terms of sheer power, they're the ones\nwith the advantage. We should avoid a\ndirect confrontation.
20	1	If we could just dismantle those\ncommando units, it would help lower\nthe colony's capabilities...
21	2	And it might give us an opening to strike?
22	1	Yeah, if it comes to that.
23	2	But it basically allows us to avoid fighting\nas much as possible, right? I like that plan.
24	4	No objections from me either.
25	3	Personally, I'd hope we\ndon't even meet 'em...
26	1	Brush off the embers that fall on your\ncoat, right? It may be best if we strike first.
27	2	You're suggesting we march\nright into Colony Iota?
28	4	In terms of strategy, making the first move\ncertainly would make it easier to seize the\nadvantage.
29	4	I think with our current level of experience,\nwe should be able to take them on...\nBut I'll leave the final decision to you.
30	6	Anyway, even for a frontal assault\nwe'll need to prepare properly...
31	2	...Right.\nI'm in favor of the attack as well.
32	2	But we should be sure to target\nthe Flame Clock specifically, and\nprepare for the worst.
33	1	Yeah...

2	K	So nice of you to come to us.\nBe assured I appreciate the kindness.
3	K	You seem quite sure of yourselves.\nI suppose your plan was to take the colony\nin one fell swoop?
4	1	We don't really enjoy being hunted.\nThe hunters' role is more our speed.

4	K	Oh, really? That's not how it looked\nfrom where I was standing.
5	1	Ah...!
6	K	It was impressive, the way you beat him.\nAnd a big help, too.
7	6	Wait, what's she saying?
8	Yb1	Dame Alex!
9	Yb1	I'm putting my foot down - only boring,\nrun-of-the-mill plans from now on.\nThis one gave me anxiety!
10	K	I said I was sorry... Don't cry!
11	4	...So, it all went down according\nto your calculations?
12	K	Our goal was the defeat of the Consul\nand to be released from his control.
13	K	Though it was a long acquaintance\nwe had... At least, until we uncovered\nthat lie of his.
14	1	What was he lying about?
15	Yb1	It's a long story...
16	Yb1	But anyway, making an enemy of the\nConsul would have been a big gamble\nfor us too.
17	Yb1	So to weigh the risk, we had to figure out\njust how strong you lot actually were.
18	4	So you used your friends\nand colony as bait?
19	4	You thought if we were strong enough\nto deal with you all, we could stand up\nto the Consul too...
20	K	You seem bitter about it.
21	4	There must have been another way.\nDispatch a scouting party, or...
22	K	Oh, come on. We'd all reach Homecoming\nbefore we got anywhere like that.
23	4	Sure, but see how much it cost you.\nIt's not worth the sacrifices!
24	K	There is no victory without sacrifice.
25	K	If you fight according to those musty old\ntextbooks, you'll always be too slow...
26	K	You're an old-fashioned man,\naren't you, Taion?
27	4	What?!
28	Yb1	Dame Alex, I don't think they'll respond\nwell to that line of exposition.
29	Yb1	Only Ouroboros can destroy\nour Flame Clock.
30	Yb1	Shouldn't we consider asking for their help\ninstead of riling them up like this?
31	K	I'm not riling up anyone...!\nJust some gentle teasing among friends.
32	Yb1	Dame Alex doesn't actually believe\nthe ends justify the means.
33	Yb1	You'll understand if you look closely at\nthe colony, and how things are here...
34	2	...What do you think?
35	1	Might be good to look around before\nwe enter into any partnerships.
36	4	What if that's exactly what\nshe wants you to think?
37	1	Let's cross that bridge when we get to it.
38	1	For now, I'd like to trust her.\nShe was quite open with us this far.
39	K	Good grief. How did softies like you\neven survive this long?
40	Yb1	Dame Alex...?
41	K	...I'm sorry.\nI admit I may have crossed a line.

1		Levnis repair parts?
2		We got 'em, but no means of transport.\nUsual route goes the long way 'round.
3		No, there's a colony we could route through.
4		Those cylinders? We'll manage.
5		We can add two days.\nWe can make it on time.
6		Prioritize speed.\nStart with light goods.
7		...That's the list there.\nI'll forward it on too.
8		Whaddaya know...
9		They're really pro at that.
10		They're not just regular soldiers.
11		More like...they're all officers...
12		We're reading the flow of goods\nto learn of the war.
13		It's a very flat hierarchy here, you'll find.
14		Using a minimum of people...to achieve maximum results.\nThat's the way we like to fight.
15		Of all the colonies in Aionios...
16		We're a bit extreme in the way we use\nthe cards... Pretty special, right?
17		You mean the cards in the...Iris?
18		Yes.
19		They tell us what's needed as of right now,
20		and it's an easy and efficient tool.
21		But, soldiers' wills and skills,\non the other hand...
22		Feeling useful makes you confident.
23		Confidence teaches a soldier pride.
24		Pride binds the team, fosters productivity...
25		and leads a colony to victory.
26		Right?
27		As a result...we can invest ourselves in more research.\nAnd it takes us a step beyond.
28		A step beyond...?
29		Well, I did propose them.
30		It's quite basic.
31		Wait, the Collectopaedia Cards... You made them?
32		The Castle folk developed them.
33		All I did was to issue the request through the Consul.
34		Meaning you made a deal with the Castle?
35		Surely that's not...
36		I didn't do it lightly.
37		It was necessary.
38		Doing the same as everyone around you,
39		it's always the same outcome.
40		Following the playbook to the letter\nis hardly a strategy.
41		And so I'm "old-fashioned"...
42		You're not mad this time?
43		I realized there was no ill will.
44		We fight when we're confident.\nYou and I, I think we're the same in that regard.
45		I'm getting the impression...\nthat something must have changed you.
46		Thank the previous commander for that...
47		He was a rash type, like this big one.
48		It winds you up, doesn't it?
49		I get what you mean.
50		Oi, what the spark?!
51		(No matter what happens,\nyou fight to keep everyone alive...)
52		(And that? That's what makes a colony.)
53		All right, Alexandria.\nI understand you now.
54		Do you think we'll be useful?
55		Doesn't matter.
56		I don't see people that way.
57		[ML:undisp ](considering)
58		Time to head back.
59		We've unfinished business.
60		That's right...
61		Time is precious.

26	K	Hush...! Not so loud!
27	2	I thought for sure we were the\nsame term...! You just have this...\ndignity about you...

29	K	Some colonies plan surprise attacks\nif they work out the timing of when the\nnext generation of soldiers rolls over.
30	K	And also, well, you know...\nReasons.
31	4	...What "reasons"?
32	Yb1	Dame Alex thinks she looks too young,\nso she likes to put on a touch of cosmetics\nto give her features extra character.
33	K	That was not public information!
34	Yb1	You were just gonna leave them\nall guessing otherwise.
35	4	...Not really what I expected.
36	K	Well that's your fault for assuming,\nisn't it? Having presence is important\nfor a commander.
37	1	This might be going over my head,\nbut...it sounds like a struggle...

1	4	Well, we scored a big win taking\nhim down. Seems like he was one of\nColony Iota's commando unit top dogs.
2	3	Makes sense he'd be a tough customer.
3	5	C'mon, it wasn't that bad, was it?
4	3	Dude... He was built like a Castle, and\nquick on his feet. And with two swords\nat once...
5	4	Let's not forget the cool, calculating\nintellect. It wasn't easy finding gaps\nin his defense.
6	4	No wonder Alexandria chose him\nfor her right-hand man.
7	5	All right, all right. I'm not sayin' he was a\npushover or anything, but he's down now,\nso can we please stop going on about him?
8	5	That should've taken Colony Iota\ndown a notch as well.
9	4	You're too happy-go-lucky by half.
10	5	Nah mate, it's you that's too gloomy,\nand by way more than half.
11	2	Even free from the Flame Clock,\nsome people might take a while to\nget used to the new situation...
12	2	But it still seems like things in Colony Iota\nhave calmed down significantly.
13	4	They're already used to individually\nconsidering their present needs.
14	4	They know that if they've got time\nto waver, they've also got time to act.
15	5	What was that guy's name? Rhyza, right?\nHis level of calm is out of this world, man.
16	5	Not a single emotion on his face...
17	4	He's in his tenth term, that'll be part of it.\nBut more than that, he's Alexandria's\nright-hand man. Trust like that is binding.
18	1	It makes sense... Perhaps he's had to walk\nthrough enough fire to get to where he is...

2	2	Reading our movements and keeping us\nin check, while supporting her allies all\nthe while...
3	2	Chelle was very multi-talented, wasn't she?\nIt was a hard fight for sure. She made us\npay dearly for our mistakes...
4	3	And she came at us with the\nworst timing. I don't wanna fight\na Healer like that again, ever.
5	4	Loath as I am to admit it, the gap\nbetween our level of experience\nand hers was a chasm.
6	4	Even when we first faced off, her control\nof the engagement was masterful...
7	1	Absolutely. We managed to turn the tables\nsomehow, but it was close...
8	4	If we didn't have our Ouroboros powers,\nit would have been no contest.
9	6	It would've been great if they\nwere on our side...
10	1	Allies with Colony Iota, huh...?
11	3	No use getting down about it now.\nWe managed to weaken them at least.
12	3	Let's just be happy with that.

14	3	Turns out she's a real solid gal! Totally\ndown-to-earth, clever, all that good stuff.
15	5	...Eunie's just on cloud nine 'cause\nChelle called her "talented".
16	3	Excuse me, good buddy? You jealous?
17	5	All right, all right, I'm just sayin'.
18	4	Chelle is supposedly the most social\namong the Colony Iota commando leaders.
19	4	She's got a collected personality,\nsees things in their proper context...\nI expect she could get along with anyone.
20	4	Her flawless support from the rear\nmay also be based in those same\ncharacteristics.
21	3	Ah yeah, I did get the feeling she looked\nat things from a bunch of angles.
22	5	Sounds like a forced compliment\nif you ask me.
23	3	Well, nobody actually did ask you,\nmuppet. You should talk to her yourself.\nYou'll see what we mean.

1	2	From what I heard, she used to be\na close-range Attacker before.
2	1	Maybe that explains why she was so\ngood at keeping the right distance...
3	5	Ugh, who makes a switch like that?\nSounds like way too much effort.
4	1	But maybe that's exactly the kind of\nreaction she's expecting out of you, Lanz.
5	5	Ugh...
6	4	She's also an accomplished intelligence\noperative, Sequoia. She can usually get\nin her enemies' heads before battle.
7	3	Wow, she must've loved Lanz's, then.\nSo nice and roomy! And the acoustics!
8	5	Oi, who you calling roomy, featherhead?!\nAnd anyway, we beat 'em, didn't we?

11	5	OK, OK, I wasn't fishing for a pep talk...\nAnd I wouldn't have been upset if Eunie'd\njust kept her mouth shut!
12	4	...Question.
13	4	Did any of you tell Sequoia from\nColony Iota about my hobbies?
14	3	That's really random.
15	6	Nobody would talk about you\nbehind your back, Taion...
16	1	Did someone find them out?
17	4	...Yes. I will save you the details, though.
18	4	Where would they have found out...?\nTheir information was startlingly detailed...
19	2	I've heard Sequoia's a skilled spy.\nGuess that means she's already done\nsome digging into us...
20	5	Hey man, so what's she got on you?
21	4	I refuse to be baited.
22	5	Dude, that just makes me more curious!

3	6	Really? To me he seemed kinda nice...
4	3	There was nothing nice about his attacks,\nI'll tell you that much.
5	3	Did he have a soft spot for girls?\nOr maybe just hated guys? In any case,\nhe was definitely playing favorites...
6	5	That's it. It makes me wanna\nsend the mudder flying.
7	4	You already did send him flying...\nIt's true though, the guy left a stink\nthat lingers...
8	4	Well, at least now I understand.\nThank you for this rare moment\nof male bonding.
9	1	...Am I being included in that, or...?
10	2	Either way, Colony Iota's defenses\nshould now be a little thinner.
11	2	We'd best stay on our guard as we go on.
12	4	My earlier theory has morphed\ninto conviction...
13	4	Fili from Colony Iota truly is an\nobjectionable human being.
14	2	Wow, Taion... It's rare for you to say\nsomething so emotional.
15	4	The way he instantly becomes over-\nfamiliar with any female interlocutor is a\ntrait I'd find hard to stomach in an ally.
16	1	Did I miss something...?
17	4	When he speaks with Mio, he blithely\ninvades her personal space.
18	2	Now that you mention it...\nThat was a bit uncomfortable.
19	3	I'll do you one better. He just went\nand grabbed me and Sena's hands\nwithout asking...
20	5	Whaaat...?\nRun that by me one more time?
21	6	It was just a handshake! ...I think.
22	4	He didn't shake hands with us.\nWhat makes Sena so special?
23	5	Ugh, I can tell my gorge's risin' again...
24	6	Uhm... I think even Alexandria cautioned\nhim for being too flippant before...
25	6	Maybe he's just the type of person\nthat rubs people the wrong way...?
26	1	Oh, I get it. So he's adept at drawing\npeople's attention to himself.
27	3	Sounds about right. He takes all the\naggro, but in the exact wrong sense.

13	2	Say, you don't think...?
14	1	Those soldiers' Flame Clocks,\nthey might be getting low...
15	4	Oh, come on, Noah. You'd better not be\nthinking of offering your assistance...
16	1	It's...hard to put into words,\nbut something's off.
17	4	And you think we have time to be\ntraipsing around on this whim of yours?
18	6	It really bothers you?
19	1	Yeah.
20	3	Give it up, Taion. Once Noah's like this,\nthere's no stopping him.
21	4	...Why do I bother?
22	5	Besides, Noah's intuition's usually\npretty on the mark.
23	6	We could just take a look?\nA tiny little peek?
24	4	...Fine. I can see no amount of reasoning\nis going to dissuade you.
25	4	However, if it turns out to be nothing,\nwe head straight back and move on.\nAcceptable?
26	1	That's fine. OK, let's move.\nWe should be able to catch up to them if\nwe follow their tracks.
evt/tq/msg_tq002002f.json
0	4	Judging by how the tracks stop here,\nit seems that this is where those soldiers\npassed through.
1	6	Through here? But...how?
2	1	Hmm. Doesn't look easily\ntraversable, does it?
3	5	Yeah, I can't see us getting across\nthere any time soon...
4	4	We could always take a detour.\nLook, this way.
5	1	Yeah. Thanks, Taion.
6	4	Like I said, we can't afford to be\nhanging around here.
7	4	Come on, we haven't got all day.
evt/tq/msg_tq002003f.json
0	6	...This is crazy.\nThere was a colony, here?!
1	L	That's right.\nThis is an abandoned colony.
2	1	Please, listen to us!\nWe didn't come here to fight you!
3	L	...
4	1	We can free you from your Flame Clock.
5	L	...Free us?
6	1	You don't have much time left\non yours, do you? We can help\nyou with that, so if you'd just-
7	L	Stop attacking you?
8	1	Yeah...
9	L	...
10	L	All right.\nI'll hear you out.
11	1	...Ah, thank you!
12	L	Please, come in.
13	4	They're still wary of us.\nWe can't let our guard down.
evt/tq/msg_tq002004f.json
0	4	I've seen a few colonies with\ndwindling Flame Clocks before,\nbut this one is especially bizarre...
1	1	It's like they're not trying to survive\nhere at all... Do you get that impression?
2	4	Back when I was stationed at Lambda,\nI'd heard rumors about Colony Tau.
3	2	What did they say?
4	4	That deep in the forest, there's a\ncolony with some very peculiar\ncustoms and traditions.
5	4	This is my first time seeing it in\nreality, but I never expected it to\nbe so run-down...
6	6	Did you have any dealings with it?
7	4	None at all. This is just hearsay\nfrom Commander Isurd.
8	1	Anyway, we should hurry. Let's smash\nthe Flame Clock and free everyone.
9	L	It being an abandoned colony,\nwe are continually starved of\nsufficient life sources.
10	1	Wait... Are you the commander?
11	L	That's right. Sorry I failed to\ntell you before. I am Juniper,\nand it's my job to lead Colony Tau.
12	4	If that's so, then surely\nyou must know who we are.
13	L	I'm afraid I know nothing.
14	1	...Huh.
15	L	We have no need of such information.
16	_c1	Juniper told us we'd welcome you in,\nwhoever you might turn out to be.
17	_c1	So that's the rule. We don't ask questions.
18	3	But you attacked us back there!
19	_c1	Our scouts told us about some monsters\nin the forest they'd never seen before, so\nwe sent them out on a hunt.
20	_c1	But then they bumped into you en route.\nThey must've figured it'd be more\nefficient to get you out of the way first.
21	L	Though contrary to our plan,\nwe were made to retreat.
22	5	Oh yeah, what about your Consul?\nWhere are they hiding?
23	L	I told you, this is an abandoned colony.\nOur Consul rarely visits us.
24	2	You're in such a strange situation...
25	1	All the more reason to get you\nout of this predicament!
26	_c1	I think you guys are getting the\nwrong end of the stick here.
27	L	...
28	L	It's true. We aren't afraid of Colony Tau's\nFlame Clock running out.
29	L	All it means is the end of our days\ngazing at our ever-diminishing supply.
30	1	But you could die!
31	_c1	Uh-huh. As if we'd just let you waltz in\nand break our Flame Clock.
32	L	We all have to perish someday.
33	L	If our lives should expire, then we'll sink\ninto silence, darkness...oblivion.
34	L	We'll return to the earth...
35	2	...
36	1	Yes, but...! You can't just...!
37	L	The land will take us, and\nwe will simply "be".
38	L	That's how it is at Colony Tau.\nNo one will ever think of us,\nand yet here we are.
39	L	Slowly but surely,\nwe are withering.
40	L	We don't always find the nutrition\nthat we need to live.
41	L	If Colony Tau cannot accumulate\nthe vital flames it needs, then it proves\nonly that we were too weak.
42	L	And in nature, the weak are\ndestined to perish.
43	4	Though logic would dictate that nature\nis pushing you to become stronger.
44	5	If we set you free, you won't\nhave to worry about all this crap.
45	L	We neither worry nor fear for\nwhat may come to pass.
46	_c1	We've already lost so many\nof our friends and allies.
47	L	And every time, we returned\ntheir bodies to the earth.
48	L	Such will be our fate.
49	_c1	What's the point in fearing\nthe inevitable?
50	_c1	We know we're gonna die.\nWhat's wrong with us living the\nway we always have?
51	1	But how do you live without hope?
52	L	It will spell the end of the story that our\npredecessors weaved for generations...\nA tale cut short.
53	L	I won't argue that it feels\na little melancholy...
54	L	In that sense, if we were to be freed\nfrom the Flame Clock, then...
55	Wd1	Juniper, bad news!
56	L	...Tell me.
57	Wd1	The monsters're coming straight\nfor the colony! And they already\ntook one of us down!
58	L	No... They came all the way here?!
59	1	We'll join you!
evt/tq/msg_tq002005f.json
0	L	Ngh...!
1	_c1	Juniper, we need orders!
2	L	...This is perfectly fine.\nWe'll defeat them right here.
3	1	Juniper!
4	L	What are you...?
5	5	Ask us later.
6	1	We'll back you up!
7	L	Thank you. I'll fight to the\nbest of my ability as well.
8	1	Here we go!
evt/tq/msg_tq002006f.json
0	_c1	Geum's OK! He's still alive!\nThank the flames...
1	L	I'm so glad we made it in time...\nI'm so glad...
2	L	Again, accept my thanks. We couldn't\nhave done this without you.
3	1	Don't worry about it.
4	L	...
5	L	I suppose it's strange of me to talk\nabout the laws of nature when I fear\nlosing my friends.
6	1	Not at all. Honestly, that seems like\nthe most natural thing of all.
7	L	When you told me that you would\nrelease us from the Flame Clock...
8	L	I thought that if you really were telling\nthe truth, it would make life easier.
9	L	But...at the same time, I began to hate\nthe fact that I was looking for a way out.
10	L	Looking up at our Clock, seeing the\nlife ebbing away... I'd already accepted\nmy fate.
11	L	And letting go of that status quo, wretched\nthough it was... After so long, I was scared\nof what might happen if we did.
12	_c1	Juniper...
13	L	Noah, your words at the time\nseemed so appealing to me.
14	L	I could not destroy the collective efforts\nthat became the colony, and everything it\nrepresents, with my own two hands.
15	L	But then you said you would destroy\nit for us. We'd be guilt-free.
16	L	If that isn't appealing...then what is?
17	1	You must've been aware of how tragic\nit is to simply await death.
18	1	That's why you invited us, isn't it?
19	L	Even now, I'm not afraid of dying.
20	L	But I hated the idea of losing\nthose I hold dear...
21	L	When I saw my friend lying there...
22	L	I remembered what you told me, and,\nfor a brief moment, felt the grip of fear.
23	L	I felt so weak and helpless...yet at the\nsame time, I didn't want to let go of my\ndear friend.
24	L	So I must have closed myself off.\nI stopped thinking. Closed my eyes\nand covered my ears...
25	L	Perhaps I was simply...waiting for\nthe inevitable release.
26	1	Even so, we have to keep thinking.
27	2	That's right - even if there are things we'd\nrather not see, we still need to look.
28	1	And breaking out of your shell, scrambling\nin desperation for a way to escape\ndespair? That's not what I call being weak.
29	1	You've defended this place for so long.\nWhy? Because you're strong.
30	1	And once you're no longer shackled\nby the rules of the Flame Clock, you\ncan accept a different reality...
31	1	You can become stronger still.\nI know it.
32	L	We can?
33	1	You can.
34	2	It won't be easy - far from it.\nBut we'll help you.
35	_c1	Juniper... It's your call.
36	Wd1	We've made it this far thanks to you.
37	L	Yes... I suppose so...
38	L	If...there is a possibility that you can\nrelease us from the Clock, then...please.
39	_c1	And if not, it's not like anything's changed.
40	L	Haha! Very true. If you can't\nbreak it, I can live with that too.
41	L	Nothing changes without a reason,\nwithout a cause.
42	L	Perhaps this event will teach me\nto see things in a new light...
evt/tq/msg_tq002007.json
0		Here we go!
evt/tq/msg_tq002008f.json
0	L	I see acceptance is actually surprisingly\neasy, when it comes down to it.
1	6	I think it probably is, yeah.
2	L	Ah... I'm sorry if this seems rude,\nbut could I ask another favor of you?
3	1	Sure.
4	L	I'd like to learn much more of the world.\nBecome a stronger individual.
5	L	To that end, is there any chance\nI could accompany you?
6	5	Whaddaya say, guys?
7	4	We could certainly do with\nsomeone of Juniper's caliber...
8	1	It'd be reassuring to have you on board.\nYou're very welcome to join.
9	3	Is your colony gonna be OK, though?\nCan they get on without you?
10	L	Colony Tau needs to undergo\nchange too. We need to extend\nour knowledge and grow.
11	L	So I'd like you to take me on\na trip. Somewhere far away...\nAnd show me something new.
12	Wd1	A journey of discovery, huh?\nI guess that's another thing we need\nin order to grow.
13	_c1	Might be an idea to send some of\nour younger recruits out too.\nCould be a good lesson.
14	L	It's time to breathe new life into our\ncolony. Let us break free from the chains\nthat once bound us.
15	_c1	I guess I'm still hanging about, though.\nCan't have us all gallivanting about the\nplace.
16	5	Your Consul really doesn't bother\nto show up, huh...
17	2	Even after we broke the Flame Clock...\nYou'd think they'd know.
18	3	Better this way, if you ask me.
19	4	Still, we shouldn't rule out the possibility\nthat they'll make trouble for you.
20	1	If something happens, you tell us\nimmediately, OK?
21	_c1	Sure, can do. We'll be counting on you.
22	4	Well, we don't have all day.\nI think it's about time we made tracks, no?
23	1	You're right. Time to move, then.
24	L	Well then, everyone...
25	_c1	Ah, don't worry about us.\nYou know we can handle ourselves.
26	Wd1	We'll prove that Colony Tau\ncan be so much more!
27	L	Yes... I'm sure it will be.
28	_c1	Off you go then, skedaddle.\nThe colony's staying right here,\nwaiting for your return...

evt/tq/msg_tq002102f.json
0	1	Just now... Those were Kevesi soldiers...
1	M	Ahh, well spotted.\nThey're forces from Colony 11, up ahead.
2	4	And going by your appearance,\nI'd say you're also a Kevesi soldier.
3	M	Mm? Who, me?
4	4	Tell us who you are.\nWhat colony are you from?
5	M	Hmm, well then.\nIf you absolutely must know,
6	M	I'm the commander of Colony 11,\nwhose soldiers just attacked us.
7	6	Wow, cool!
8	6	...Wait, what?!
9	2	Huh?!
10	3	Their *commander*?!
11	5	Hang on, back it up! If you're the\ncommander of Colony 11...
12	5	Then you're...Ashera, the Undying Blade!
13	3	"Undying"? What in the Queen's name?\nShe meant to be some kinda celebrity?
14	5	There ain't a Defender worth their salt\nin all of Keves who hasn't heard of her!
15	5	She's the commander of a\nSilver-rank colony... In the running\nfor the strongest person in Keves!
16	4	Getting back on topic... You're telling us\nyou were attacked by your own colony?
17	M	Hm. I suppose I am telling you that.
18	2	But why? What for?
19	M	Well, I guess I have given them a couple\nof reasons. These things happen, y'know.
20	M	Anyway, I'm going to remove Colony 11 from\nthe equation. You guys wanna come with?
21	6	Huh?! "Come with", why...?
22	3	Er, sorry? Now it's open season?\nThis is all kinds of stupid!
23	5	But you're talking about your own colony!\nYour mates! You'll just go off and fight them?
24	M	Sure. One rarely gets to enjoy a battle\nsuch as this. Also, I have my own\nreasons for killing them.
25	M	Besides... Sitting back and letting them\nkeep taking swings at me is not my style.
26	M	It's just...no fun that way.
27	5	I don't think you're meant to\nsay that part out loud...
28	1	Well, but... Why are you\ninviting us to join you?
29	M	Huh? So you're telling me...you're not\nthe great and terrible Ouroboros?
30	2	Huh?! You knew...?
31	M	Come now, I've heard this personally from\nthe Queen. Every commander alive knows\nabout you lot.
32	M	As I hear it, you're some kind of\nrebels, going around wrecking\ncolonies' Flame Clocks.
33	3	That's outrageous! ...Well, it's also\ntrue, mostly. But we don't do it just\nfor the fun of it!
34	1	It sounds like you're not everyone's\nfavorite person right now, either.\nWhat's your goal?
35	M	Hahaha!\nSurely it's self-evident, no?
36	M	On the battlefield, you have\none of two options.
37	M	Fight and live, or fight and die.
38	1	Uhh...
39	M	When considering the pure act of trading\nlife back and forth, there's no separation\ninto enemies and allies.
40	M	Not for the killers, nor for the ones\nbeing killed.
41	M	That's something you soldiers should get.\nMore so now you've rebelled, and made\nsure everyone wants your heads...
42	3	Like I keep saying, nobody here\ndid that on purpose...!
43	M	I'm sure. Everyone has their own way of\nthinking. I'm not trying to say otherwise.
44	M	In any case... There's a place for you\non my battlefield, if you feel like joining.
45	M	I'm sure Colony 11 will give you a warm\nwelcome... Though maybe not the one\nyou'd wish for.
46	3	What IS her problem? What in the Queen's\nsnow-white wings does she want from us?
47	1	I don't know... But she certainly\nseems to be after something...
evt/tq/msg_tq002103f.json
0	M	Oh! Don't tell me... Have you actually\ndecided to accept my invitation?
1	1	Well, you know...\nWe do owe you for helping us before.
2	M	Ahaha! I've never heard of anyone\nentering the Volff's den just because\nthey owe someone!
3	4	How were you even planning on fighting\na whole colony alone? Charging at them\nhead-on?
4	M	Ah, you must be the tactician.\nGot it in one, poindexter.
5	4	...You're insane.
6	M	Oh, come now. We live in a world of strife -\nof constant, unending war - and you question\n*my* sanity?
7	3	Know what? Just sounds like suicide\nto me. Maybe you really have lost it.
8	1	Eunie, that's too far. Even for you.
9	3	OK, but you did hear her, right...?
10	M	My colony, Colony 11, guards the Castle,\nand it's rightly hailed as being impregnable.
11	M	Not a single Agnian soldier has ever\nbroken through, not even once.
12	M	I've fought long and hard to defend\nthis colony. And now I'm going to\nbring it down... Just one woman.
13	M	Can you think of anything more satisfying\nthan that? I know I can't!
14	3	You know what else you're not thinking of?\nThe moment they open fire and turn you\nto mincemeat. How's that for a punchline?!
15	M	If that happens, I'll do my soldierly\nduty and turn into a lovely corpse.
16	3	Oi!
17	M	Ahahaha! I'm touched by your concern,\nbut they won't be killing me that easily.
18	M	All of you. I'm sure you've overcome\nyour own share of hairy situations.\nWe can do this.
19	3	Pfft, what would you know?\nYou don't know a thing about us.
20	5	Don't be such a worrywart, Eunie.\nWe can do anything if you've got\nour backs.
21	3	You're awfully enthusiastic\nabout this, Lanz.
22	5	Y-you reckon?
23	6	Now I think about it, you've known about\nAshera since the start. Do you maybe...
24	5	Sh-shut up!\nShe's the best Defender in Keves!
25	5	I'm just some nobody. If somebody told\nyou you'd get to fight alongside a legend,\nwouldn't you jump at the chance?
26	M	Ahahaha, what an awfully nice thing to say.\nI'll be looking for some great things from\nyou, uh...Lanz, was it?
27	5	Wuh, I, uh, er, um, er, eh...
28	3	Ugh... Gimme a break!
29	M	Well then, my dear Ouroboros fellows!\nWhat say we sally forth?
30	M	The battle awaits us, one that's sure\nto prove a most thrilling distraction!\nAhahaha...
31		Ashera has temporarily\njoined the party.
evt/tq/msg_tq002104f.json
0	M	No wonder your little gang is causing\nwaves. You were completely ruthless\nwith my lot!
1	3	Do you have to talk about us like that?
2	6	Just so you know, we actually\nwere trying to go easy on them...
3	M	Oh, no need to hold back. You can wipe\nthe floor with them! That's me giving you\nthe green light, as their commander.
4	3	I heard of some terrible commanders\nbefore, but this one takes the biscuit,\nhands down...
5	5	You know, there's rumors that some\nsoldiers in Colony 11 are crazy tough.
6	1	Is that right?
7	5	Yep. Way I heard it, they have snipers who\ncan shoot you from behind a mountain,\nor specialists who can read your mind...
8	3	Bollocks... Those aren't even\ngood rumors.
9	M	Ooh, now this sounds interesting.\nIs there anything they said about me?
10	5	Huh? Oh, um. Yeah?\nI mean, they might have\nmentioned...some...things...
11	M	Go on, try me. Even though\nI can probably guess...
12	5	...They call you "Ashera, the\nUndying Blade". A heroic commander\nfamed throughout Keves...
13	5	Another name they use is... Uhh...
14	M	Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm?
15	5	..."That suicidal maniac".
16	M	(sigh) OK, I see.
17	3	Wow, that kinda sucks.
18	M	Oh, definitely... I was prepared for\nanything, but this...it's...
19	M	It's just so bland, so boring!\nI was hoping for something\nwith more zest, more bite!
20	3	*That's* what you're hung up on?!
21	4	...If you're finished chatting,\nI'd like us to get moving.
22	4	Don't forget, we're smack dab in\nthe middle of enemy territory.
23	M	Oops, you're right.\nNot much time until reinforcements come.
24	M	I'm feeling a little miserable, but I can take\nit all out on my men, no problem.
25	3	Yep, it's official. We found\nthe worst commander...
evt/tq/msg_tq002105f.json
0	M	Now we're here, Colony 11 is only a\nstone's throw away. The final battle is\nnigh, ladies and gents!
1	4	Before that, there's one thing I want\nto confirm. Who is leading the enemy?
2	M	A type of person you should know very\nwell by this point. Care to make a guess?
3	4	...A Consul. I knew it.
4	M	That idiot has delusions of being a\ntactician. She's the very definition\nof a narcissist.
5	M	I'm sure right now she's drunk on the\nfeeling of controlling the soldiers like\npuppets.
6	1	So those soldiers... She's just\nflinging them at us against their will,\ntrying to beat us down?
7	5	Ugh, what a snuffing creep.\nMakes me wanna hurl.
8	M	I wouldn't pay that too much attention.\nMy guys are enjoying themselves\nregardless.
9	3	Oh really? And how exactly do you figure?
10	M	Can't you tell from how much of a fight\nthey've been putting up so far?
11	M	They're seriously coming for blood.\nWell, mostly mine, of course.
12	4	So...what?\nThe Consul doesn't even need\nto force Colony 11 to attack us?
13	3	Seems like a stretch, even considering\nour current company...
14	M	I couldn't say for certain.\nThey're the same as I am, after all...
15	3	The more you say, the less I understand.\nAre you just gonna keep skirting around it?
16	M	Whoa now, no need to sweat the finer\ndetails. All you need to do now is enjoy\nthe fight for what it is.
17	M	The next battle will be even tougher.\nWhich is to say, that much more fun!

0	wW1	So, the traitors have arrived.\nOr perhaps I should call you\nbeasts, driven by my hounds!
1	1	So you're the Consul for Colony 11!
2	wW1	Ouroboros scum. Have a care for how\nyou address me.
3	wW1	With a single order, I could have\nyou creatures crushed this instant!
4	1	Ghh...!
5	wW1	It appears you understand. Now stay right\nthere. I will dispose of you later.
6	1	...What?
7	wW1	First, I'll deal with you, *former*\nCommander Ashera. Step forward.
8	3	Hey! Rude...!
9	M	With all due respect, Madam Consul,\nyou called us traitors just now.
10	M	If I, never mind them, am to be\naccused of the crime of treason...
11	M	...I'm afraid the great Consul will\nhave to enlighten us as to the reason,\nbeasts that we are.
12	wW1	You are as impudent as ever...\nBut I will explain to you, this one time!
13	wW1	You engage in battle without orders! Use\ndeviant tactics in battle! You openly violate\nmilitary regulations!
14	wW1	And your worst crime of all...\nMultiple unforgivable slights\ntowards a Consul!
15	wW1	Don't bother trying to deny it!\nAll of the soldiers here have\nwitnessed this!
16	M	And as a result, we have brought\nmany victories for Keves.
17	M	Aren't glory and military success\nwhat the Consul desires?
18	wW1	And when did I hand out such orders?\nNever forget that all of you are pawns.
19	wW1	A pawn acts as it is placed on the board!\nA pawn that acts on its own has no more\nworth than the mud under my boot!
20	6	Jerk!\nTalking to her own soldiers like that...
21	wW1	However... Well.
22	wW1	Throwing away a Silver colony,\nno matter how rotten, is hardly\nthe action of a wise woman.
23	wW1	At present, bringing Colony 11\nunder my direct control is the\nmore pressing matter.
24	M	So you have no further use for me?
25	wW1	Tch. I should think a "suicidal maniac"\nlike you would cherish being destroyed\nby her countrymen.
26	5	You... Shut your rotten mouth!
27	M	I see. Then it seems you have been\nlaboring under several misconceptions,\nMadam Consul.
28	wW1	How foolish. You'll use this\nchance to spout more drivel?
29	M	Until now, Colony 11 would rush off to\nbattle wherever you waved your hand.
30	M	But you see, we did it\nbecause we wished to.
31	M	If there was a battle we felt was\nworthy of us, we soldiers would\ngive our lives fighting it.
32	M	That's all we ever wanted.\nMy soldiers...and myself.
33	wW1	Hmph. What are you driving at?
34	M	Looking at it another way,\nnothing else matters to us but that.
35	M	Not even fighting against people who were\nour allies until only yesterday...
36	M	...and not even obeying someone\nwho isn't worthy of being our master.\nIs it dawning on you yet?
37	wW1	What?! What are you blathering about?
38	M	The pawns you thought were faithful to\nyou were truly worth less to you than\nthe mud under your boot...
39	M	...since the very beginning.
40	wW1	C-cease your confounded blathering!\nThis instant! How dare you?!
41	M	Ughh... This is getting on my nerves.\nIf it's all the same to you, I'd really like\nto drop it now.
42	M	So...come and kill me. If you can.
43	wW1	...
44	3	...
45	wW1	Hah!
46	wW1	Hahahaha... Hahahaha!!!
47	xW1	If death is what you seek, I'll be delighted\nto grant you it, you worthless scum!
48	M	Wow! She turned into a monster!\nNow I've seen everything!
49	3	Hmph. Gettin' scared, are you?
50	M	Do I look scared?
51	3	No, you really don't.\n...Just forget it.
52	1	Ashera, don't underestimate her.\nShe's not like anything else you've fought.
53	M	Yeah, I'm getting that impression.\nWell then, Ouroboros!
54	M	Time for the fight we've\nall been waiting for!
evt/tq/msg_tq002107f.json
0	wW1	You creatures... You're all pawns!\nNothing but pawns!!!
1	3	She's still alive?!
2	M	Hmm...
3	wW1	What's wrong? Go on, kill me!\nIsn't that what you want, you animal?!
4	M	Hmm... Nope.
5	3	Wha...?!
6	wW1	What?!
7	3	Queen's wings, have you lost\nthe snuffin' plot?! She's Moebius!\nShe's the enemy!
8	M	Yeah, but...ending it like this...\nHow should I put it? ...Oh. I know.
9	M	It's a waste.
10	wW1	...
11	4	Are you insane?
12	4	...In fact, never mind. Forget I asked.
13	M	There you have it, Madam Consul.
14	M	You can make a strategic retreat,\ndo whatever, I don't mind.
15	M	If you're planning revenge, by all\nmeans pay Colony 11 another visit.
16	wW1	You... You bitch!
17	M	Or, if you actually definitely *do*\nwant to die, I have no qualms in\nspeeding you along.
18	wW1	...Oh. You will pay for making me\nlook a fool... You'll pay dearly!
19	wW1	Grraaaagh!
20	1	The Consul... Moebius...\nShe's more dangerous than you know.
21	M	Oh, I know that. That's why I'm\nexpecting big things from her.
22	2	Wow. I don't know what to say...\nThis woman is something else.
23	M	Right. A victory needs fireworks.
24	M	Make it something big!\nYou came all this way.
25	6	Uhm, is she saying what\nI think she's saying...?
26	5	She does have a point, I suppose.
27	1	You guys are a Silver colony.\nYou sure about this?
28	M	Didn't you hear my speech?\nI said nothing else matters.\nNot to us. So?
29	1	Got you.
evt/tq/msg_tq002108.json
0		Here we go!
evt/tq/msg_tq002109f.json
0	1	There. You're all free now.
1	1	No need to fight, no need\nto take life from others.
2	M	Hmmm. I wonder if you can\nreally call that freedom.
3	4	Hm? Care to explain?
4	M	My soldiers and I, we were never\nfighting for the sake of earning life\nin the first place.
5	5	Back up, back up... Surely you had to be,\nright? I mean, that's the usual setup...
6	M	True, true. Normally you'd fight\nto keep the Clock fed. Only natural.\nOtherwise you're dead.
7	M	But for us, we live so we can fight.\nIt's how we've lived our lives.
8	6	Living to fight...sounds kinda awful...
9	M	You must understand now that you've\ncrossed Blades with my troops.
10	M	They didn't follow the Consul's\norders because they were frightened\nfor their lives.
11	M	We were using the situation we're in\nto our advantage.
12	3	Eh? What's the point of that?
13	M	I should think it's obvious.
14	M	We hope...that someday we can have\na proper fight to the death, with mighty\nwarriors like you.
15	M	I've taken part in all these battles\nto make that dream real. That's all.
16	6	I... I see.
17	3	No, not "I see", Sena!\nJust think about it for a sec.
18	3	These guys've been killing\neach other, having their own\nlittle murder party! It's crazy!
19	M	Yep. If you're gonna be blunt about it,\nthen that's exactly what it was.
20	3	That doesn't make it any better!\nAll this "living to fight" crap...
21	3	How many lives will you need to take\nbefore you're satisfied? Or maybe you\nwanna die, is that it?
22	M	Yes. I want to die.
23	3	Pff, good try.
24	M	...
25	3	...Wait. You ain't serious?
26	M	Is it that surprising?\nA soldier like you should-
27	3	...Grow the snuff up.
28	M	Hm?
29	3	Grow up, I said!
30	3	So you wanna fight, you wanna die.\nWhat the snuff is your problem?!
31	3	You come out with all this highfalutin\ncrap, but really, that Consul was right\nabout you!
32	3	You're nothing but a bloodthirsty beast,\naren't you?
33	6	H-hang on, Eunie!
34	3	You listen. You ain't gonna involve us\nin your stupid suicidal quest!
35	3	Just leave us alone, all right?!
36	4	Eunie! That was out of or-
37	M	Poindexter.
38	M	Wow, I am pretty exhausted after all this.\nI think I'll take a load off somewhere.
39	M	Oh. You can all make yourselves\nat home. Consider it a thank-you\nfor joining the fight.
40	1	Ashera, shouldn't we...
41	M	Well then, I'll be off.\nWhat you do is up to you.
42	1	Eunie. That was not cool.\nI want you to apologize later.
43	3	...Please tell me you're not taking her side.
44	1	Everyone should be free to choose\nhow they want to live their life.\nWasn't Ethel the same?
45	3	Oi, she's nothing like Ethel, got it?!
46	5	Well, that's for sure.\nBut you did kinda go overboard there.
47	2	Eunie... I know how you feel, but...\nCould you...try?
48	3	Tch.
49	3	Fine, you win, whatever.\nI'll talk to her. Will that do?
50	1	Sure.
51	3	...'s sake.

0	3	Hey!
1	M	Hm?
2	3	Erm. I mean... Well, I-I wanna\ntalk about before.
3	3	...I'm sorry. I went too far.
4	M	...
5	M	Ahahahaha!
6	3	Wh-what are you laughin' at?!\nI'm bein' serious here!
7	M	Ahh, no, sorry, sorry!\nIt's just... You surprised me.
8	M	And I don't think you went too far.\nWhat you said was the unvarnished truth.
9	3	...And that stuff about wanting to die?
10	M	Even without Flame Clocks, people die\nat some point...be it sooner or later.
11	M	So before that happens...\nI want to leave my mark on this world.
12	M	Some kind of proof that we were here...\nIn the short time we've been given.
13	M	For me, *that* is what I want\nto achieve by dying.
14	3	...Sorry, I still don't get it.
15	3	It seriously just sounds like you\nwant to destroy yourself.
16	M	Dying to fight and fighting to die\nare different, though they might\nsound the same.
17	M	If I can make my death mean something,\nthen I can finally prove my life had value.
18	M	"Live fiercely, die spectacularly"...\nThat's how I want the battlefield\nof my life to be.
19	3	...
20	M	...Well, all that said, looking from\nthe outside, all people see is the\n"suicidal maniac".
21	M	And Colony 11 is the last refuge for\npeople like us. Isn't that funny?
22	3	I don't see the joke.\nYou really are insane...
23	M	Hahaha, how many times have\nyou said that today?
24	3	S'pose. But, you know...
25	M	Mm?
26	3	At least now I get that you're not enough\nof an idiot to throw yourself off the top of\nhere.
27	3	And your life really is yours to do with as\nyou see fit. It's not my place to go off on\nyou just because we don't see eye to eye.
28	3	Besides... The way you fight, fearless\nand fierce and all that...?
29	3	Honestly, it's kind of awesome.
30	M	Yeah...? Think so, eh?
31	3	What? Revvin' up for another dig?
32	M	No... How do I put it... No one's ever\ntalked that way to me before.
33	M	I guess...I'm happy? Maybe?
34	3	You ain't embarrassed, are you? You?!
35	3	Ha ha ha! This is priceless!
36	M	Yeah? Couldn't you tell I was joking?
37	3	...I really, seriously hate you.
38	M	Aww...! That hurts!\nAnd here I was taking a liking to you!
39	M	I mean...from now on we're all\nfellow rebels. So, you know...
40	M	You and I should be friends, Eunie.

1	2	What's it doing here...?
2	4	Doesn't look like it's after us, somehow.
3	5	Wanna follow?
4	4	Even better, let's make a big sign saying,\n"We're idiots, please shoot us".
5	5	You what?!
6	3	Give it a rest, Lanz.\nSo, what's the plan. Noah?
7	1	Right.
8	1	Since it's a Ferronis, it'll doubtless have a bunch\nof people enslaved to a Flame Clock.
9	2	They might not be too happy to see us, though.
10	4	We'd be lucky if that was all.
11	4	Consuls...or rather, Moebius,\ncould be there too.
12	1	True. Which is why, whether we follow\nthem or not, we need to think carefully.

1	3	Is that...\nDidn't we see that Ferronis before,\nat Ishan Isle?

0	N	Ahh, I do love the sea.\nSo I'm taking this thing on a trip.
1	4	Moebius? On a trip?
2	N	O' course! A man's life is a long journey.\nWalk your path without a destination and\nyou'll get little encounters, like this one.
3	5	Yeah, uh, if you think we're gonna trust\na Moebius, you're off your rocker, man!
4	N	Hoho! Sounds like yer in an awful pickle\nand no mistake! What a disaster for ye!
5	N	But ye see... Moebius I may be, but\nI don't got any orders regardin' ye.
6	N	I'm a free agent, says I.
7	N	Anyway, there are things on the sea\nso tasty they'll make ye weep! Along\nwith some gigantic monsters.
8	N	So I arranged for them to be here. Things\nyou landlubbers would never dream of!
9	5	You mean you're mixing the colony up in\nall this, just so you can have a bit of fun?
10	N	Guess you're right.
11	N	I just love watchin' the sea from\na Ferronis, truth be told.
12	N	Therefore, free agent that I be, I work\nas Colony 15's Consul, with a spot of\nmoonlightin' as the commander.
13	N	The other Moebius tell me rubbish like\n"your name is T". Perhaps it's fate I met up\nwith you lot.
14	N	So, if you please, you can call me\nCap'n Triton!
15	5	Um... Somebody...\nTell me what's happening?
16	1	Captain Triton. I get what you're saying,\nI do. But...
17	3	Noah, you ain't humoring this windbag?
18	of1	Indeed! Can't listen to any words\nfrom this man's mouth!
19	of1	His crazy, reckless schemes will get\nfriends dead! Smashed to pieces!
20	N	And what! Once I get an idea, I have\nto put it in motion, otherwise nothin'\naround here would happen!
21	pf1	The Cap'n's awesome!\nHe might be an ugly lump, but he can\nsmash a big monster clear into next year!
22	N	Well, I like a good challenge, so we spend\na chunk o' time goin' around, and... Wait.\nWho're you callin' ugly?
23	pf1	Whether they're in the sea or the sky,\nwe find big nasties and biff 'em up good!
24	2	Riiight. Gotcha.
25	N	...You definitely called me ugly.
26	5	Look, Mio. We're better off keeping\naway from this lot. You can't be best\npals with a Moebius!
27	N	Come now, young pup! You've only just\narrived. Fancy a little contest?
28	6	A...contest...?
29	N	The wind brings me a couple of rumors,\nsuch as all of ye bein' pretty capable!
30	N	Seein' fellow warriors always gets\nme fired up! So, it be contest time!
31	5	What are you on about?\nNo way I'm doing that.
32	N	Scared, eh?
33	5	Eh?!
34	N	Aye, you're lily-livered! Guess Ouroboros\njust run away with their tails between their\nlegs. That right? Hah!
35	N	Li-ly liv-ered!
36	5	Who're you calling lily-livered?!
37	4	Just leave it, Lanz.\nYou're wasting your time bothering with\nsomeone like him.
38	N	Must be nice for you, leavin' one foot out\nthe door so the sparks won't fall on you\nwhen there's trouble!
39	N	You're frightened of gettin'\nknocked down, so you're makin' out\nlike you're warnin' him?
40	N	You tryin' to save face or summat?\nBe you so scared of Moebius?
41	N	That's lily-livered, or my name's\nnot Cap'n Triton!

4	of1	Rules are simple!
5	of1	In vicinity of Colony 15 there\nthree islands! Each island have\nspecific challenge.
6	of1	Team that solves challenge fastest\nwins points!
7	4	Hmph. If that's all we need to do,\nthis'll be incredibly simple.

11	of1	Contest teams are: all of friends' team,\nversus the Captain and three others.
12	5	Eh? So we have a bigger team?\nDoesn't seem fair.
13	N	Ye be guests, you see. I'll accept a\nhandicap, by way of hospitality.

2	1	Uh, brawn...?
3	vf1	Welcome to\n"Men of the Sea: The Brawny Deep"!
4	vf1	There are some beasties in this area\nknown as Gyaarks. You have to bring\ndown four of them.
5	vf1	It goes without saying that the first\nto do so wins the challenge! What are\nyou standing around for? Get to it!

6	5	Look at you, you're knackered!\nWho's taking the handicap now? Eh?

0	uf1	Ahoy! Welcome to the next challenge,\n"Men of the Sea: Booty Calls"! Bring me\nhigh-quality booty, and I'll judge it!
1	1	...Booty?
2	uf1	Exactly! I need the most valuable\nbooty on this island!
3	6	You keep using that word...
4	2	Yeah, we don't know what you mean,\nor what's on this island...
5	4	Surely you could send us after something\na little more concrete!
6	uf1	Booty is booty. If you can't tell good booty\nwhen you see it, then we're done here.
7	5	All right, fine! We'll do it!
8	2	Let's have a think then. Group talk?
9	1	Yeah, group talk.
evt/tq/msg_tq002208s.json
0	5	I'm not 100% on what "booty" is.\nIs it like treasure?
1	3	Yeah, maybe something shiny?\nSomebody'll find that valuable, probably?
2	4	Hmm, good point. I think you might be on\nto something, there.
3	1	Something valuable...like something\nthat's been around longer than us?\nLike a hundred times older than us?
4	3	Like what? Are you sayin' a handful\nof rocks is more valuable than us?
5	tV	Friends wrong! Treasure is clearly food\nso delicious it makes whole face fall off!
6	2	I dunno... Food's kind of subjective.\nDifferent people like different things.
7	4	I don't think we're going to\nagree on anything.
8	1	Instead of finding out what's right...\nwhy don't we just collect everything?

3	3	We found these three things, but-
4	uf1	Now wait a second!
5	3	Mate, rude.
6	uf1	What I asked you for was booty\nof the highest value!
7	uf1	Whichever way you slice it, there's\nonly one most valuable booty, not\ntwo, and certainly not three!
8	uf1	So, please pick one of them and\npass it to me.
9	5	Awkward... What do we do?
10		Which booty will you pick?
11		Millennial Tree Amber
12		Yum-Yum Coconut
13		Ancient Taos Fossil

2	uf1	Ah, Cap'n! You're a little late.
3	N	Booty you asked for, and booty\nyou shall receive!
4	5	Hey, hey, we were first!\nGet in line.
5	uf1	Settle down, settle down! We're not\nconcerned with who came first in this one.\nYou can both go at the same time.
6	N	Fine by me!
7	5	Bring it on! This is our-
8	N	Booty!
9	5	Wha...
10	uf1	Oho! Can't believe you both\nbrought the same thing!
11	9	Believe it!
12	9	This Yum-Yum Coconut blast off\ntastebuds and most of face with its\ndeliciousness! Is greatest treasure!
13	N	See, this girl knows what she's talkin'\nabout! It's tasty, it's huge...
14	5	So...both sides brought the same thing?\nWhat happens now?
15	uf1	Looks like we have a draw.\nI can't give either of you the point if you\nbring the same thing.
16	N	You best be lookin' carefully now,\nLhukavu!
17	N	Surely you can see mine be way\nbigger than his?!
18	uf1	A coconut is a coconut.\nI'm not going to play favorites just\n'cause you're the cap'n, Cap'n.
19	N	Ah, just stow it. Fine.\nOn to the next one!
20	N	We'll settle things on Cape Arcaphor,\nmark my words!
21	1	I'm not sure I can keep up\nwith that energy of his.
22	2	It is a bit much...
evt/tq/msg_tq002211f.json
0	5	This is what we've picked.\nGet a load of that!
1	uf1	Oho, interesting!
2	N	Yarrr, they be here first!
3	5	All right, beef. Taking it easy are we?
4	N	Unlike some people, I have\na more discerning eye and\ntake my time with things.
5	N	Anyway, what've ye got there?\nA rock, is it?
6	N	Hahaha! Ye reckon ye'll beat me\nplonkin' down a little old rock?
7	5	Say that again!
8	N	This is what I brought.\nAny fool can see it's bigger.
9	5	Wha... That is pretty big!
10	uf1	Oh! Good choice, Cap'n! This local fruit\nis said to be jaw-droppingly delicious!
11	9	Totally true!\nManana could have told you that!
12	N	Hmph. That'll be a win for me then.
13	uf1	Our guests are the winners, Cap'n.
14	N	What?!
15	uf1	I did ask for the most valuable booty!
16	uf1	What our guests have brought sells for\nten times more than that coconut!
17	uf1	And while the coconut is certainly\ndelicious, its value is only...so-so.
18	N	Maybe the value is only so-so, but\nhave you seen it? Look at the size!\nAnd it tastes fantastic!
19	N	Bigger be better than smaller, says I!\nIt's worth more in size, therefore I win!
20	9	Friend right!\nTaste alone make it bestest treasure!
21	5	Hey, whose side are you on, shortcake?!
22	9	Manana will not make fibs.\nTell Manana what more important than\ndeliciousness!
23	N	Ye can't say fairer than that.\nI win.
24	5	No, you did *not* win. Just man up\nand accept you lost!
25	uf1	Cap'n... Accepting defeat is part\nof being a man of the sea.
26	N	Ghh... Ye've really got me over\na barrel here... Well played.
27	N	But the next one's gonna\nbe mine, ye'll see!
28	N	Come to Cape Arcaphor!\nI'll give you a damn good thrashin'!
29	1	Augh...
30	2	That man is a few screws\nshort of a Levnis...

0	pf1	Ahoy chums! I've been waiting!
1	pf1	You haven't sighted Saoru, have you?
2	1	Saoru? No, I don't think so, sorry.
3	pf1	Curses... I knew he'd be up to his\nusual tricks!
4	pf1	That Saoru... He couldn't find his way if\nyou nailed a map to his bum!
5	5	That good with directions, is he?
6	pf1	He's probably got himself ate up by\nsome monster! Hahahaha!
7	2	And that's...funny?
8	pf1	Saoru was gonna do this next part, but I can't\nhelp it if he's done a disappearing act, can I?\nSo it's up to me to explain the next challenge!
9	pf1	The first group to track a certain monster\nand bring it down is the winner!
10	4	That all sounds quite simple.
11	6	Yep. Find some big footprints, follow 'em.
12	pf1	Well, best of luck to you!
13	1	OK then. Let's head out.
evt/tq/msg_tq002213t.json
0	1	We've got footprints.\nTwo sets of them...

3	1	Good question.

0	tf1	Hm? Ahoy, guests. What's up?
1	5	What's up? We wanna know what\nyou're doing here, that's what's up.
2	tf1	That's not good, friends. You're supposed\nto be taking down that monster! Oh. Did I\nexplain that to you already?
3	3	No, you'd scuttled off somewhere, so we\nhad to get the deets from someone else!
4	tf1	Well, that's not good then, is it! If you waste\ntime here you're gonna lose!
5	3	We followed the tracks here, you numpty!
6	6	Ah! We got more tracks here!
7	5	Oh my-\nWe'd better follow these, then.
8	tf1	Good luck, friends! You'd best not hang\nabout, or the Captain'll sail ahead!
evt/tq/msg_tq002215f.json
0	5	Yusss, now that's what I'm talkin' about!
1	1	Now that was a bone-cruncher, eh?
2	5	Where are the others? No sign.\nRight, let's leg it back to the Ferronis!
3	4	Yeah. That buffoon's going to regret\nmaking fools of us!
evt/tq/msg_tq002216.json
0	5	The big lug still isn't here?!
1	of1	No. Friends have come back\nbefore arrival of Captain.
2	of1	Have to say, Captain is not\nmost punctual...
3	N	Augh! Don't tell me we're pipped to the post again!
4	of1	Captain. Captain is late.\nIs never good thing to make guests wait.
5	5	It gave us a liiittle trouble, but we handled it.\nWe were well ahead of ya!
6	5	Pssh, it was a piece of cake!\nMaybe we shoulda given you a handicap?
7	of1	Winners of contest are honored guests-
8	N	Men of the Sea: Triton's Triple Challenge!!!
9	N	Part Four!!!
10	3	...What?
11	N	The last challenge be a good old punch-up.\nThe winner gets, uh...
12	N	What do I need?
13	pf1	Um, seven points.
14	N	What he said.
15	N	Good. Now, put 'em up!
16	5	Oh, this is takin' the piss!\nIt's called the "triple" challenge!
17	4	Yes, we agree for once!
18	4	What happened to "a man doesn't go back on his word"?
19	N	Heh.
20	N	You be right, he doesn't.
21	N	But a man always wants more!
22	5	Ugh, this clod!\nWhat crud is he spouting now?!
23	4	It's the same stuff he's been spouting from the start.
24	1	(gasp) Lanz!
25	5	Huh?
26	N	Ye better pay attention!
27	N	Man of the Sea's Sucker Punch!
28	5	[ML:undisp ](getting sucker punched)
29	6	Lanz! You OK?!
30	3	What a bloody underhanded way to start a fight!\nArsehole...
31	N	Carelessness on the sea gets you killed.
32	N	A man's gotta pay attention\nevery second of every minute!
33	of1	Sorry, Captain can't be stopped\nwhen he gets like this!
34	of1	Friends, watch out or get sucked\ninto Captain-tornado!
35	5	Nnngh... A snuffin' sucker punch...
36	5	Now you're in for it.\nPlaytime's over, "matey"!
37	N	Ha-hah! Have at you, then!
38	N	I'll take ye all on at once!
evt/tq/msg_tq002217.json
0	5	[ML:undisp ](heavy panting x2)
1	5	So it's settled, right? We totally won this bloody thing...
2	3	Man, what a real mudder of a Moebius...
3	3	Ugh, my aches have aches...
4	N	Hurgh... Haha.
5	N	Ye've bested me.
6	N	Ye ain't half strong!
7	1	It wasn't exactly one-on-one.
8	N	To be sure! I'd have beaten any\none of ye in a fair fight!
9	N	But...I feel no ill will.
10	N	Been a while since anyone knocked me down.
11	5	Well, *I'm* feelin' all *kinds* of ill.\nHe snuffin' sucker punched me!
12	4	I have a question. If you're a Moebius,\nyou could have transformed at any time, right?
13	4	So, why didn't you do it?
14	N	Ah, young 'un. Only thing I trust\nare these old bones and my own two fists.
15	N	In a brawl, anythin' else kind of taints things.
16	N	Besides, usin' anything else be no fun at all!
17	5	I feel that... I think.
18	N	Ah, truth be told, I've been alive so long,
19	N	I've clean forgot how to transform!
20	N	Hah hah ha!
21	4	Oh for spark's... Don't know why I asked.
22	N	By the by...
23	N	Wonder if I could ask ye a favor.
24	5	Come on! Think it's a bit early\nin our relationship for that!
25	N	If I let this get away from me now\nI might not remember again.
26	N	I gave up thinkin' ahead long, long ago, see?
27	2	Well then...what is it that you need?
28	N	Ha, well! I want you to smash that big ol' shiny thing.
29	6	That's your Flame Clock...?
30	5	Mate, do you even have a clue\nwhat you're saying right now?
31	N	I've been waiting for this moment.
32	N	For that thing to disappear, see?
33	1	Are you really sure?
34	N	Yeah. Tear it down, says I.
35	N	While I'm around to watch it happen!
evt/tq/msg_tq002218.json
0		Here we go!
evt/tq/msg_tq002219f.json
0	N	Finally, you're free, friends...
1	5	Huh...
2	2	I know it's a bit late to ask this, but...\nAre you sure this is OK?
3	N	Now you boys and girls might\nnot be understandin' this...
4	N	I've been a Moebius for a long time.\nSeen and learned a lot about death.
5	N	The thing with death is, it doesn't care\nabout your feelings... It just comes when\nit wills.
6	N	I've seen people who lived short but full\nlives, people who cling to every last bit of\nlife, people who're only too happy to die...
7	N	I've encountered so many people,\nI've lost count. But, good or bad,\nthey die, while I carry on.
8	6	But...but of course that's going to\nhappen, with the way the world is...
9	N	If I'm gonna accept things just because\nthat's how they are, then maybe I've\nbeen livin' too long.
10	N	Watchin' the way they lived, I ended up\nthinkin'... Wonderin', what fun these\npeople could get up to if they were free...
11	N	Somethin' fun, maybe somethin' stupid.
12	4	Fun?
13	N	Sure.
14	N	I think about Dougie, best strongman I ever\nsaw. Or Serena, nobody loved the sea\nlike her. Gould had no equal in battle.
15	N	I knew all sorts of spirited folk, but no\nmatter who they were, the Flame Clock\nwould end up bein' their reason for livin'.
16	N	I wanted to do somethin'... But not even\nthese boat hooks could put a dent in that\nblasted thing.
17	5	You mean you tried to do it\nas a Moebius?
18	N	Aye. But nothin' came of it.
19	N	That's when it really hit home\nthat I was a Moebius...
20	N	I couldn't destroy the Flame Clock...\nand after a while I just gave up.\nIsn't that ironic?
21	3	Man. And here I thought you were just\nsome giant without a thought in his head.\nTurns out there's a bit more to you.
22	N	Hahaha-hah! It be true, gettin' the old\nnoggin going is not a skill I possess.
23	N	But round about the time I gave up\nthinkin' about anythin', I started hearin'\nabout you lot.
24	1	About us?
25	N	Yep. Some idiots goin' around beatin'\nup Moebius, smashin' up Flame Clocks,\nthings of that ilk.
26	N	Need I explain any more? I knew you were\nthe ones who could release my friends,\ntrapped by that infernal clock.
27	6	Well, we did do that...
28	4	Indeed, I suppose you could say\nthat us destroying the Flame Clock\nset your friends free.
29	4	But that doesn't mean that your friends\nwould have got the same lease on life\nas Moebius.
30	N	You don't half come out with\nsome tripe, four-eyes.
31	4	Four-ey-?!\nMy name is Taion.
32	N	I be talkin' about in here.
33	6	The...heart?\nYou mean like feelings?
34	N	That's right, girl.
35	N	It doesn't change anybody's lifespan,\nbut in that moment, it's the bonds between\nus all that changed.
36	5	But you're a Consul. You're telling\nme something's changed between you\nand your underlings?
37	N	I think you know the answer, boy.
38	N	We be equal now, not tied to each other\nby time, or who be above and who be\nbelow.
39	5	Equal...
40	N	Aye! Me and ye are equals. We've had a\ngood brawl, and now there's no grudges.
41	1	So...what will you do now?
42	N	Good question.
43	N	I reckon I'll find the next big beastie\nand beat the snot out of it! Hahahah!\nHope you got room, kiddies!
44	5	Uh?
45	N	Didn't really think I'd be fightin' Moebius...\nAh, but I'm a big boy. It'll be fine!
46	2	You mean...?
47	3	You're joining us?
48	N	Yep. I bet you feel all kinds\nof reassured!
49	3	Uh, I mean... You are pretty tough...
50	5	Wait wait wait...\nDid you forget we're Ouroboros?
51	4	And he's Moebius! You're gonna go\nagainst your own kind?
52	N	Too right! You could live a thousand years\nand not get the chance to team up with\nOuroboros and take a pop at Moebius!
53	N	I may like an odd scrap with some\ntough 'uns, but goin' on some idiot\nadventure with 'em sounds fun, too!
54	1	Uh...
55	2	What d'you think?
56	2	What do you think, Noah?
57	1	...He doesn't seem the type to have\nany ulterior motives.
58	N	There's one.
59	N	I've a debt to pay ye,\nand I decided I'll pay it now.
60	N	Otherwise, ye softies'll get knocked\ndown by the next breeze that comes along!
61	4	And not because you're planning on\npunching us when our backs are turned?
62	N	Nope. When I have a problem with\nsomebody I be the sort to tackle it\nhead-on.
63	5	I mean... No, you definitely punched\nme when I wasn't looking.
64	N	Avast with your pesky details!\nCome on, this is a good deal!
65	5	...All right. You convinced me.
66	6	You sure?
67	5	You can't say you hate him\nafter listening to all that!
68	1	That's true.\nOK, you're on the team, Triton.
69	N	Glad that didn't take long!\nI like a good snappy decision, so I do!
70	5	But! If you put one foot wrong,\nwe're kicking you out faster than you\ncan say Ouroboros!
71	N	Hahah! I shan't, cross my heart!
72	N	Just you watch, boy! I got me own\nspecial power I can help you out with!
73	5	Oh yeah? I'll keep my expectations low.
74	of1	Meh-meh?!\nWhat happen to Flame Clock?!
75	N	Oops. Guess I'd better relay\nthe tale to my men.
76	N	Oh! One last thing.
77	5	Huh? What is it now?
78	N	I got feelings deep as the sea,\nwhich I like to pound into some tough\nenemies.
79	N	I want to fight forever. But when I became\na Moebius, that's when I realized that one\nhuman life would always've felt too short.
80	N	I've lived my life in fear,\nworried that it was too short.
81	N	But now a quick scuffle with ye all\nhas helped clear things up for me.\nI really felt alive!
82	5	Err...
83	N	I be grateful.\nThanks to ye, I can chart a new course.
84	5	Tch, get outta here with all that, man.
85	N	Ha! You got it!

11	5	Oi, don't be a clod.
12	O	...Huh?!\nI'm, I'm not...!
13	5	Oh what, you're really serious then?\nHow're you gonna save anyone when\nyou can barely stand yourself?
14	5	You got a death wish or something?
15	O	(gasp)
16	1	Let's break it down. As I see it,\nyou have two options here.
17	1	You can go in and try to save them\nby yourself...
18	5	...Or you can let us pitch in.\nWhich one of those strikes you\nas the better idea, eh?
19	O	...You want to...help me?
20	5	I dunno, that depends. But I wouldn't be\nin such a hurry to throw my life away.
21	5	Being ready to die, and actively\ntrying to get yourself killed are\ntwo very different things.
22	O	(gasp)
23	O	Ahhh...!
24	3	It's just a quick patch-up, but it\nshould help you think straight.
25	3	Sorry about Lanz and his\nthreatening display of idiocy.
26	5	What's threatening?!
27	3	You missed the point.
28	5	I did not miss the...! Oh.
29	6	Look, you can relax.\nWe're all friends here.
30	2	Would you mind telling us\nwhat's going on?
31	O	Yeah, OK...\nThere was a...Kevesi raid...
32	O	There was no time. I had to cause\na diversion, so I leapt in without a\nsecond thought...
33	O	After that, it's... It's all a blur...
34	2	That was pretty reckless of you.
35	8	Remind Riku of someone Riku know.
36	5	Oh?
37	4	Whatever the case may be,\nwe had best hurry.
38	4	Judging by the situation, your allies\nwere likely forced apart and are now\nfighting alone.
39	O	(gasp)
40	1	It really sounds like it would help to have\nsome numbers on your side, no?
41	2	For now, let's take the best course\nof action we can. We can hash out\nthe details later.
42	O	The best...course?
43	O	...
44	O	My name is Fiona.\nI am the commander of Colony Mu.
45	O	I know this might be a lot to ask,\nseeing as we've just met...
46	O	But please, lend me your strength!\nI need to save my people!

21	O	That's why...
22	yf1	You've made up your mind,\nhave you, Fiona?
23	O	...Yeah.
24	O	That's why...I want to try trusting, too.
25	O	I want to destroy our Flame Clock.\nWould you mind doing us this one\nlast favor?
26	4	Hm? It's hardly a problem for us,\nbut why the sudden request?
27	O	We heard about a liberated colony\nfrom Nopon travelers.
28	O	That's what got me thinking...\nThere should be more to life than\nspending it fighting all the time.
29	O	"Being ready to die, and actively\ntrying to get yourself killed are\ntwo very different things."
30	5	Sounds to me like you've been\nmullin' it over.

32	5	Heh... Good on you!
33	6	Looks like you got it figured out.
34	O	You'll... You'll trust me?
35	2	That's the same look you gave us\nwhen we first met.
36	2	You'll do anything to protect your\nfriends, won't you?
37	O	...Eheh!
38	5	All right then!\nLet's make tracks for Colony Mu!
39	4	...That is, if she didn't still seem\nto be having second thoughts.\nCare to tell us why?
40	yf1	...Oh, you noticed?\nWell, that makes things easier.
41	yf1	There are two major stumbling blocks.\nThe first is that you'll have to somehow\noutwit the Consul...
42	yf1	And second, that only that Consul\nknows the location of the Flame Clock\nunder discussion.
43	2	Huh? How can you not know...?
44	O	The one you see right now...\nThat's just a fake.
45	3	Fake?! How's that then?
46	O	Oh, but the Consul isn't here right now.\nThis might be the right time to act...!
47	yf1	Fiona, this isn't the place to be\nhaving this conversation.
48	O	Ah! Right, sorry...
49	yf1	In any case, let's talk details at the colony.
50	yf1	Our people are on their last legs.\nWe'll need time to get back to strength.
51	O	Uhm... Please, take this!
52	O	I'm happy you were able to\nsend everyone on their way.
53	O	It really helped me to be a little\nmore positive. Thank you so much.
54	O	Sorry about all the urgent requests...
55	O	We'll be waiting for you at Colony Mu.\nDon't keep us waiting too long!

1	O	Everyone!\nWe've been waiting for you.
2	5	This is awesome...\nDid you guys make this?
3	O	I...suppose we did.
4	O	Whenever we say farewell to a friend,\nwe plant flower seeds.
5	O	They kept growing over time,\nand before we knew it, we had this.
6	2	It's beautiful, but...\nTo think of all the departed...
7	O	Standing still spells death.\nIf we can't achieve victory,\nthere will be no tomorrow.
8	O	But still, we didn't want to forget\nthat they were all here, once...
9	5	So that's why you're gettin'\nall teary-eyed...
10	O	Wh-what? N-no?\nIt's just the pollen...
11	yf1	It doesn't take much to get\n"Commander Boo-hoo" here going.
12	O	Irma!!!
13	5	Looks like you've taken a lot\non your shoulders.
14	5	...Doesn't it weigh you down?
15	O	A little. I just wish I wasn't\nsuch a weakling...
16	yf1	You can put the burden down\nwhenever you want, you know.
17	yf1	You can still choose to keep things\nthe same as always.
18	yf1	I wouldn't think any less of you if you did.\nNeither would anyone else here.
19	O	...I love you for saying that, Irma.
20	O	Just like I love everyone here,\nand Colony Mu, where I met you all.
21	O	And ever since I realized that,\ntomorrow stopped looking so dark.
22	O	And that's exactly why...\nI can't run away from my responsibility.
23	yf1	...I get it.
24	yf1	Whatever happens, I trust in you.
25	O	And I trust you too!
26	_f1	Fiona! Irma!
27	_f1	All the squad leaders have\nassembled. We can start the\nmeeting at your convenience.
28	O	Understood. I'll be right there.
29	@f1	Oh, but before that, Fifi...
30	@f1	Tickle ambush!\nCoochie-coochie-coo!
31	O	...Eek! ...Ahahah...!
32	O	Stop it...! Hehehehe!
33	@f1	Teehee... Loosen up, Fifi! Get it all outta you!
34	_f1	...Yep, now she's back to herself.
35	@f1	We're waiting in the square!
36	O	Why... I'll get you back, you'll see!
37	@f1	Eek! Heehee...!
38	_f1	Run awayyy!
39	yf1	It's hard to imagine that the Consul\nwill make it easy for us, with the\nFlame Clock...
40	yf1	Someone will surely pay for this\nwith their life, again...
41	yf1	Please, do whatever you can\nto make sure it's not Fiona.
evt/tq/msg_tq002307f.json
0	xf1	Are we seriously gonna do it now?
1	xf1	Those Kevesi dudes are\nstill loitering around...
2	5	Who's loitering again?
3	xf1	...Guh?! ...He's huge...!
4	5	Sounded like someone was\nhavin' a bit of a whinge.\nWe all good here?
5	O	We're great!\nRight, Tallow?
6	xf1	R-right, chief.\nNo whinging here...
7	5	Say again?
8	xf1	N-n-nothing to say really!
9	5	...Hm. I'll take your word for it.
10	4	Time is of the essence. Sorry to rush,\nbut can we get straight to the point?
11	2	What should we talk about first...?
12		What should we ask?
13		About the fake Flame Clock
14	1	You said the colony's Flame Clock\nwas a fake. What did you mean by that?
15	Wg1	Wow, pretty blunt, huh?
16	Wg1	Honestly, we don't really know any more\nbeyond the fact that it's a fake.
17	@f1	Since we never use it, anyway, yeah?
18	xf1	When it's close to running dry,\nwe get orders from the Consul\nto go out and fight.
19	5	Well, what is it for, then?
20	O	Do you think maybe there's\nsome weird advantage to it...?
21	O	Like, maybe the Colony's rank is really\nhigh, but it makes it look lower, to get\nenemies to underestimate us?
22	xf1	O-or the exact opposite.
23	xf1	Actually we're bottom tier, but it looks\na lot higher to intimidate people...?
24	O	Oh yeah! It could be that.
25	5	Well, your actual strength doesn't\nchange, so it'd be pretty obvious\nonce you get down to it...
26	1	And also, supplies from the Castle are\nallocated based on rank.
27	1	Could we see your supplies?\nThat would give us a good idea\nof where you fall, rank-wise.
28	@f1	Nico's on warehouse detail! And I'm Nico.\nI'll get things ready for your inspection!
29		About the real Flame Clock
30	3	You said nobody knows where your\nreal Flame Clock is, except the Consul?
31	3	How are we supposed to find it, then?
32	xf1	I don't suppose...we could just...\nask the Consul...?
33	yf1	(sigh)
34	xf1	Ohhhh come on, why the huge sigh?!\nI was just asking! Someone had to ask!
35	4	Well it has to be somewhere, or the\nstatus quo wouldn't be maintained.
36	4	If you fight, the Flame Clock must fill up.\nSuppose you were to harvest a large pool\nof life in a short time...
37	O	Oh! It would flow into the real Clock!
38	4	I'd like to investigate any large-scale\ncombat engagements you may have\nexperienced.
39	4	If we're lucky, someone may have\nwitnessed some signs of the Flame\nClock's operation.
40	2	Could we take a look into your\npast battle records?
41	O	Of course! I'll have them delivered to you.
42		About the colony's rank
43	3	If the current Flame Clock is fake,\nwhat happens when your rank goes up?
44	yf1	As far as I know, I don't think\nthat's ever happened.
45	5	Wait, you're joking!\nYou've always been on the same level?
46	@f1	Nico - that's me - heard something\nfrom the Consul one time.
47	@f1	She said to tough it out and do exactly\nas instructed, and everything would\nbe all right.
48	O	Oh? I was told something else.
49	O	"People only see what they want to see",\nI think it was...?
50	5	Uh... Meaning?
51	3	Meaning, nobody actually wants to see\nhow much is left on their Clock, I guess.
52	xf1	Yeah, I mean, if you knew, you'd just\nstress out over it constantly...
53	yf1	A little more stressing wouldn't go amiss\nin your case, Tallow, you Tirkinhead.
54	xf1	Wha-?!\nWhy'd you gotta call me names?!
55	yf1	Just 'cause.
56	xf1	Wow...
57	4	Well, we don't know exactly what\nthe Consul intended...
58	4	But she must have had something\nin mind, to go to these lengths rigging\nthe contraption.
59		About the Consul
60	4	You said the Consul was away.\nDo you know how long for?
61	Wg1	Tell you bluntly, we don't know either.
62	@f1	She's always disappearing, going off on\none special mission or another...
63	4	In that case, she could be back\nat any time...
64	O	I'm sorry that the answer\nisn't very useful...
65	2	This all sounds like kind of a big deal.\nIt doesn't bother you...?
66	Wg1	It's nothing special.\nWe don't normally talk much about it...
67	yf1	She just sends us down broad-stroke orders,\nlike, "Go defeat those guys", "Send a team\nto this location"...
68	xf1	Yeah, the only time she spoke normally\nwas that one time, wasn't it?
69	xf1	You know, the time when Fiona\nbecame commander.
70	O	Yuck... Do we have to talk about that...?
71	1	About what?
72	yf1	When the previous commander died,\nFiona clung to the Consul's knees.
73	yf1	Started saying that the way we fought\nwas making everyone miserable...
74	xf1	Yeah, it turned into a whole, like, debate...
75	xf1	Until the Consul was like, fine then,\nyou try and change it! And made\nFiona the commander.
76	6	What, just like that?!
77	O	...I know it was a twisted kind of\npunishment. But now I've got everyone\nelse tangled up in this mess...
78	@f1	Whatever! We know you just\nwant the best for us, Fifi!
79	Wg1	That's why you get yourself\nin such a tizzy!
80	yf1	And that's why we wanna support\nyou in turn. You're good, Fiona.\nBetter than you know.
81	O	Mhm... Thanks, guys.
82	1	Punishing someone with a\npromotion? That's so bizarre...
83		About destroying the Flame Clock
84	5	So, this whole Clock-breaking thing's kind\nof a sudden development, yeah? I wanted\nto ask how you lot feel about all this.
85	5	We know how Fiona feels, but are you\nall OK with what we're about to do?
86	xf1	...Honestly, I just want Fiona\nto be able to relax, like, not have\nto carry all this responsibility.
87	O	That's so kind of you...
88	yf1	...Even if we do this,\npeople will still die.
89	xf1	Yeah, but if they do, it'll be because\nof their own failure. That's not the same.
90	xf1	She carries the banner for us,\nand it's because of us that it's so heavy.
91	yf1	But that weight's also the momentum\nthat keeps her moving forward.
92	yf1	I don't want us doing anything that could\nsully the purity of Fiona's conscience.
93	Wg1	All right, all right, let's all take\nsome deep breaths...
94	@f1	We're all friends here! Keep it civil!
95	O	I'm happy that you're so concerned\nfor me. Thank you.
96	5	Well... I reckon things'll work out\none way or another. I mean, come on -\nyou've got us on your side!
97	3	Yeah, you tell 'em Lanz.
98	5	No one wants to lose their mates...\nJust don't lose track of what matters,\nyeah?
99		Nothing else
100	2	I think we've more or less heard\nall we need.
101	1	Yeah, I think so too. It's time to\nget to work. Let's check out the\nloose threads we've uncovered.
102	2	We should investigate the supplies\nin the warehouse, and the Colony's\nbattle record data. Is that right?
103	O	I'll make sure everyone gives you\ntheir full cooperation!
104	yf1	We'll also try looking around for\nanything we might've missed.
105	xf1	If anything turns up, we'll be in touch!
106		We have nothing more to ask.

1	Yg1	You said you'd come back.\nYou liars...
2	4	...Sorry to bother you. We were hoping to\ncheck out the old battle records...?
3	Yg1	Ah! Right. Fifi said to expect you!
4	Yg1	Bear with me for a moment...
5	Yg1	...Right, I've transferred you the data.\nIf you see anything interesting,\nlet me know.
6	4	Thank you, we will.
7	Yg1	If this will put an end to the fighting,\nI'll spare no effort in helping.

0	@f1	Welcome to Nico's warehouse! I'm Nico and\nthis is my, well, not "my" exactly, but it's a\nwarehouse all right! Look around all you like!
1	1	Thanks. I won't be a minute.
2	1	Nothing here really stands out... It's all\nas I'd expect from a colony with the rank\ntheir Flame Clock says they are.
3	4	By the way, are you the one who\ndoes inventory management here?
4	@f1	No, I think it might be the Consul...?\nNico only watches the warehouse.\n...Nico, I should say, is me.
5	4	Why would a Consul do that themselves...?
evt/tq/msg_tq002310s.json
0	4	OK, let's not mince words.\nColony Mu is weird.
1	3	And this is why you can't make friends.
2	4	...I've looked into their combat records.
3	4	For the past few years, there have been no\nlarge-scale combat engagements involving\nColony Mu.
4	4	That in and of itself is understandable,\nbut...
5	5	But we can't do that investigation survey\nthing you thought up earlier, right? Back\nto the drawing board then?
6	4	Well, perhaps, but what really caught my\neye was the "wastelessness", so to speak.
7	4	Without any big wins or losses,\nnot only were there no large swings\nto the Flame Clock total...
8	4	There were also no interruptions to the\ncolony's supply chain over the long term.
9	5	...So? What's that prove, except\nthat Fiona and the others are fending\nwell for themselves?
10	3	I've gotta say, that's not really\nthe impression I got of this place\nat first glance...
11	3	We've heard 'em chatting. They don't\nreally seem to talk a whole lot of training\nor strategy...
12	3	And think about the personnel turnover...\nYou saw the flower garden. Notice how\nyoung they all are...?
13	4	Add to that the Consul's extended\nperiods of absence...
14	4	Ignoring for the sake of the argument the\ninsecure environment, the colony's military\nresults couldn't really afford such stability.
15	6	Come to think of it, didn't Fifi say\ntheir colony rank's stayed the same...?
16	1	Right. And the Flame Clock issue\nis odd as well.
17	1	I couldn't stop wondering what the point\nof the deception was. We said we thought\nit could be to fool enemies, but...
18	1	The soldiers here aren't given information.\nIt's not even being manipulated, just flat\nout not being supplied.
19	1	Fiona and the others didn't seem bothered\nby it, but I think in the real world, it\nwouldn't do them any real favors.
20	3	Right, of the two sides it's actually\nFiona and the others that it affects.
21	6	What was it Tallow said...?\nSomething about not stressing all the time...
22	5	...Hold. Back the snuff up.\nYou're not saying...?
23	4	The people the Consul wanted\nto deceive... Was it the residents\nof Colony Mu all along?
24	2	...There's one more thing that bothers me.\nLooking at Fiona and the others, didn't\nthey remind you of someone?
25	2	They don't believe in anything beyond\nwhat they can see in the moment, still\nthinking that fighting is everything...
26	6	...Like we did way back when?
27	2	Right. They're so occupied with the\nreality put in front of them, they don't\nthink of anything beyond that horizon...
28	2	In Colony Mu's case, they don't seem\nmuch interested in anything apart from\nthe banner that Fiona carries.
29	3	True, that. Soon as it's about Fiona,\nthey all get super passionate...
30	5	You think they're being used?
31	4	No... It's not a question of\nbeing used or otherwise.
32	4	I'd imagine we're also\n"only seeing what we want to see".
33	2	So that's why Fiona was appointed\ncommander? Because she's useful for\nhiding whatever's inconvenient...?
34	1	If the Consul had to go to such lengths to\ndevise this, there can be only one reason.
35	1	The Consul is betraying Colony Mu.\nThe raid we interrupted must have been\ntheir doing as well.
36	6	Then we've gotta tell Fifi straight away!

25		I'll fight by your side against whatever it is\nthat's making you sad, Irma! So, please...
26		Stop calling it...a dream...
27		Hey... Don't disappoint me like that...
28		You've already made your choice.
29		You chose what you wanted to see, and freely!
30		Just how heavy is that banner?
31		How many lives do you carry?
32		Please, stop...
33		All of their hopes... You did say you'd shoulder them, didn't you?
34		You said you'd never break, huh?!

0	1	Who is this girl...? Where did she come\nfrom? For a soldier, she's awfully, uhm...
1	3	...Yeah, I know what you mean. She looks\nabout three terms old. Way too young to\nbe fighting on the front lines.
2	5	Not to derail the convo, but are we sure\nshe'll be OK? We pulled her outta the\nLev, but is there anything else we can do?
3	4	I don't see any external injuries,\nbut no signs of waking up either.\n...Hard to tell either way.
4	6	...
5	2	Sena, don't worry. She's still alive,\nI'm sure she'll pull through.
6	6	Mimi... You sure...?
7	3	Look, we can talk about her all day,\nor we can find her a doctor. I know\nwhich one I'd prefer.
8	4	All right, but she and her people did\nassault Colony soldiers, so taking her to\na Colony seems like asking for trouble.
9	1	Then how about the City?\nThey have medical facilities there.
10	4	...Indeed, seems advisable.
11	5	What do we do about the Levnis?
12	1	Let's leave it for now. Transporting\nthe girl should take priority.
13	6	...Um, I can carry her!
14	2	Thanks, Sena. She'll be in good hands.
15	6	Yeah, I'll make sure of it!
evt/tq/msg_tq002403t.json
0	6	Doctor!
1	fl1	Oh, it's you.\nWhat's got you in such a flurry?
2	6	Here, let me tell you...
3	fl1	Hrm... Well, it seems she's simply\ntemporarily lost consciousness as\nthe result of a blow to the head.
4	6	Oh... So, does that mean she'll be OK...?
5	fl1	Yes, it's a passing symptom. With a bit of\nrest, she should come awake naturally.
6	6	Phew, that's a relief...
7	fl1	Until she does, I'd like to\nkeep her here for observation...
8	6	Ah! Wait! That's not really necessary...
9	fl1	...Seems like there might be a reason\nfor your reluctance, hmm?
10	6	N-no, it's just that, she's, uhm... Er...
11	fl1	Oh dear...
12	fl1	There's an empty house tucked away\nin a quiet corner of the City. I'll send word\nto let you use it.
13	6	Doctor...
14	fl1	The patient will be transferred there.\nThe rest is up to you, hm?
15	fl1	...I hope you'll find this agreeable?
16	6	Ah! Yes! Thanks so much!\nYou're a life-saver! Ah, more\nthan usual, I mean!

1	cm1	About the girl we transferred here...\nShe's just woken up.
2	6	Whoa! Really?
3	cm1	Yeah. Although, I should say,\nshe's a little, uhm...
4	4	Were there any complications?
5	cm1	...No, nothing like that. Or at least,\nnothing to complain to you about.
6	3	You're not making sense,\nand it's getting me antsy...
7	cm1	The doctor said she didn't need any\nmedical attention, and... You know what,\nwhy don't you just talk to her yourselves.
8	cm1	Just bear in mind, she's still a patient,\nso take it easy on her, eh?
9	4	Seems at least they kept her safe...\nBut now what?
10	3	Yeah, it ain't like we can just leave her\nhere forever...
11	1	Let's talk to her first, like he said.\nWe should try to learn more.
12	5	All right, but she's recently injured.\nWe probably shouldn't all crowd her.
13	2	You're right. If we're just asking questions,\none person should be enough.
14	4	That sounds like a plan. So who'll go?
15	5	Surely it's Eunie, right? She deals with\ninjured people all the time, she should\nbe right at home.
16	3	Oh yeah? Cheers for volunteering me.
17	6	...I'll go.
18	2	You, Sena? Why the sudden impulse?
19	6	Well...\nIt's probably my fault she's like this...
20	5	It was really more like an accident,\ny'know. There's no need for you to\nfeel responsible.
21	6	It's not that exactly, it's more like...\nIf I don't do something, erm, I...
22	6	...I'll have a dirty con...con...\ncon-science?
23	4	You've never heard that word\nout loud, have you?
24	6	Gah...
25	1	Well then, we'll leave the girl to you.\nIs that all right, Sena?
26	6	Yeah, I'll be fine.
27	3	Do be careful though.
28	3	She might be meek now, but keep in\nmind she and her mates came after us.
29	2	We'll be right outside.\nIf anything happens, just shout.
30	6	I can handle myself, Mimi.\nBut thanks, I will.

1	6	Ah...!
2	fW1	...
3	6	Uh, um...\nHi! I-I see you've woken up!
4	fW1	...
5	6	How are you feeling?\nAny pain?
6	fW1	Can confirm faint sensation of pain in\ncranial region. However, operational\nefficiency of No. 7 remains unaffected.
7	6	Whuh?! Ah, O-OK...\nThat's...good...?
8	6	Actually, I'd, uhm...\nI'd like to apologize...
9	fW1	...
10	6	Before, I didn't realize you were\ninside that thing, and...
11	fW1	...
12	6	...Erm, are you OK?
13	fW1	No major issues detected.
14	6	I-I see...
15	6	A-anyway, if it's all right with you, could\nyou tell me something about yourself?
16	fW1	The question lacks specificity.\nNo. 7 cannot respond.
17	6	Oh, I'm really sorry! I-I guess that\nwas a bit wishy-washy, huh...\nWell, for starters, then...
18	6	Are you a Kevesi soldier?\nOr are you Agnian?
19	fW1	Keves... Agnus...
20	6	Yeah, that's right.\nYou must know those, right?
21	fW1	Affirmative. However, discrepancy was\nencountered while processing query.
22	6	...Huh? What do you mean?
23	fW1	Affiliation of No. 7 does not match\neither of two options provided.
24	6	Doesn't match...?\nWell then, that only leaves...
25	fW1	Special mobile combat unit under\ndirect Moebius command, alias...Colony 0.
26	6	...Whoa! You know about Moebius?!
27	fW1	Affirmative.
28	6	Then, when you attacked us...
29	fW1	Colony 0 soldiers of numbers 7 and below\nwere tasked with eradication of Ouroboros.
30	6	Wh-whoa, that's...not great.
31	6	So this girl really *is* our enemy...\nI have to warn the others...!
32	6	...Although... Is that really true?
33	6	She did attack us...\nSo why is she like this now...?
34	6	Uhm, what you just told me... It sounded\nreally important. Won't you get in trouble\nfor saying it?
35	fW1	I was not ordered to silence on the matter.
36	6	I, I see, OK...
37	6	Oh, shoot, I forgot to introduce myself!
38	6	My name is Sena. What's yours?
39	fW1	I have no name.
40	6	...Huh?
41	fW1	No. 7 does not possess information\nunder the category "name".
42	6	You don't have a name...?
43	6	Wait, so this "number seven" thing\nyou've been saying all along...?
44	eW1	An individual identification number\nassigned to soldiers of Colony 0.
45	eW1	We do not belong to Keves or Agnus.\nWe are special assets. Publicly we\ndo not exist.
46	eW1	Consequently, records of personal\ninformation stored in growth modules\nare also expunged at the time of birth.
47	6	That's...crazy...
48	eW1	Shall I consider the questioning\nto be over?
49	6	No, wait! What you just said...\nYou don't think it's strange?
50	eW1	Cannot ascertain purpose of question.\nRequesting additional clarification.
51	6	I mean, for example... That name thing!\nA Colony that calls people by a number,\nthat's so dehumanizing...
52	6	Don't you feel bad to be called like that?\nI mean, you're the same as us after all...
53	eW1	Cannot ascertain purpose of question.
54	6	(sniff) Ohh...
55	eW1	Requesting clarification.
56	6	(sobbing)
57	5	Sena? ...Hey, you OK?
58	3	Did you learn anything?\n...Hang on, love, you don't look so good.
59	2	What happened, Sena?
60	6	Mimi, I... I...!\nI don't know what to do...
61	1	Hey, Sena, everything's fine.\nLet's go somewhere we can talk.\nIs that all right?
62	6	Y-yeah, sure...
evt/tq/msg_tq002406f.json
0	1	"Colony 0"...? Wow, they did seem like\nmore than regular soldiers, but that's wild...
1	3	If they're palling around with Moebius,\nwe can't really ignore them, I suppose.
2	4	We still have very little information.\nI think a more thorough investigation\nis in order.
3	5	OK, but we're talking about\na tiny third-termer here.
4	6	(sigh)
5	2	Sena, what do you think?
6	6	Huh? Wh-what do I think about what?
7	2	You're the one that spoke with her.\nWhat's your gut telling you?
8	6	I just... I just asked questions,\nand she just answered them.
9	6	But... Even though she attacked us,\nshe doesn't seem hostile, or violent...
10	6	And when I spoke to her, she was literally\njust answering questions, it didn't feel like\na conversation at all...
11	6	She looks like us, but is actually a whole\ndifferent kind of being... That's how I felt...\na-and then I got scared of her, and...
12	2	Aw, I'm sorry Sena...
13	1	Sena, give us your honest opinion.\nDo you think she's an enemy?
14	6	...I don't really know yet.\nThat's kind of why I...
15	6	I'd like to try talking to her again, I think.
16	5	Whaddya mean? You just said\nyou were scared of her.
17	6	I am, it's true, but... I want to make sure\nI got the right idea, and that's stronger\nthan my fear.
18	6	Not just about if she's an enemy,\nbut also about who she actually is,\nhow she thinks and feels...
19	5	...I get it. You'd need\na bit more time for that, sure.
20	6	Right. I also want to say sorry for leaving\nwithout saying anything, last time...
21	3	OK then, if you're doing a house visit\nand apologizing at once, how about\na little gift to grease the wheels?
22	2	Oh! Sena, you could bring her your onigiri!
23	1	Onigiri?
24	4	It's a portable Agnian snack,\nmade of packed boiled mythrice.
25	2	They're lovely and salty, especially the\nway Sena makes them! They really hit\nthe spot after a long training session.
26	5	Huh, you can make food...?
27	6	O-of course I can!\n...Onigiri at least.
28	6	Oh, wait...\nBut we don't have any mythrice...
29	4	They should have decent reserves\nin Colony Lambda.
30	3	Hey, nice! ...No, hang on, how did you\nknow that off the top of your head?
31	4	...Commander Isurd likes them. The onigiri.
32	5	Well, that's just peachy then.\nHope he doesn't mind sharing.
33	6	...Thanks, you guys!
evt/tq/msg_tq002407t.json

1	yc1	We're close to the water here,\nso the harvest's always good quality.
2	6	Huh! I never knew...
3	yc1	If you ever need more,\njust holler at your boy.
4	6	Now we only need a place to cook...
5	6	They taste best when they're fresh,\nso maybe we could use the canteen\nin the City?
evt/tq/msg_tq002408f.json
0	6	Man, I haven't made onigiri in a minute...\nHope I can still shape them right!
1	6	Ahh, that's nice!\nNow, let's take them to our patient.
evt/tq/msg_tq002409f.json
0	4	Sena, wait. This time around we'd like to\nsit in on the conversation too.
1	6	Huh? But I thought...
2	5	No worries, we'll hang back and watch.\nWe're happy to let you do the talking.
3	6	Um, OK then, if you say so...
4	6	Hey, sorry to intrude...\nCan we have a moment?
5	eW1	No objections.\nYou wish to resume questioning.
6	6	No, that's not why I'm here.\nIt's just that last time, I was kinda rude...
7	6	So to apologize, I thought I'd visit again\nand bring you a little something.
8	eW1	...!
9	6	I figured you might be hungry.\nThey're called onigiri...
10	eW1	Yes.
11	6	I'm not very good at this, so they're\nabout the only thing I can make...
12	eW1	...Yes.
13	6	But I can guarantee they're tasty,\nand actually Mimi says so too...\nAh, Mimi, I mean Mio, she's...
14	eW1	...Yes.
15	6	...Oh, sorry, my bad!\nPlease, feel free to eat.
16	eW1	I will eat.
17	6	How about it, then...?
18	eW1	Cannot affertain...\npurpofe of...queftion...
19	6	Are they tasty?\nDid I make them right?
20	eW1	With regard to...firft queftion...\nNo. 7 confiderf..."tafty" to be\naccurate...affeffment.
21	6	Oh, r-really? That's good to hear!
22	eW1	In regard to...fecond, application of manual\npreffure...refulted in compaction and higher\ncohesion. Alfo showing...excess salt levelf...
23	6	Oh... No, wait, that's the best part!\nIsn't it nice and chewy?
24	eW1	(gulp)... Affirmative.
25	6	...Huh?
26	eW1	No. 7 has not taken sustenance\nin this form before.
27	eW1	Currently considering that others\nof Colony 0 may also enjoy the\nexperience.
28	6	...Oh, you think so?
29	eW1	Particularly No. 9 seemed to be\ngrowing disaffected with the rations\nbeing distributed...
30	eW1	And No. 3, whose calorie intake exceeds\nthe baseline, may find these more sating...
31	eW1	As a precaution, salt levels may\nhave to be marginally adjusted\npursuant to guidance from No. 6...
32	6	...
33	eW1	Hm? Is there a problem?
34	6	No, no, it's nothing. Oh, but if it's OK\nwith you, could I ask you to tell me more?
35	eW1	Acknowledged. Continuing explanation.
36	6	So, were the onigiri tasty?
37	eW1	You already have a sufficient reply to this\nquestion.
38	6	Have you come to like the onigiri I made?
39	eW1	Affirmative.
40	6	Well, that's good then.\nI'll make them for you again sometime.
41	eW1	Yes.
42	5	...Well she eats like normal, and she can\nhandle small talk.
43	3	Yeah, there's nothing suspicious about her.\n...Except she talks funny, but whatever.
44	2	Let's let Sena keep her talking\nfor a bit longer.
45	6	Hey, you said you didn't have a name.
46	eW1	Recollection of making such a\nstatement exists.
47	6	Well, then... What about "Segiri"?
48	eW1	Hmmm.
49	6	...Uh?
50	eW1	Perhaps this is some sort of code\nor cipher.
51	6	No, I'm just... I was asking what you\nthought about "Segiri" for a name.
52	eW1	Cannot follow logic behind query.\nRequesting more rational explanation.
53	6	You're using difficult words again...\nI just didn't want to keep only\ncalling you "you".
54	eW1	The designation "No. 7" is...
55	6	Right! I just took the "se-" part from "seven"\nand tacked on the "giri" from "onigiri". "Segiri"!
56	eW1	Failure to comprehend basis for utilizing\nthis nomenclature.
57	6	Well, it's 'cause... You said you liked\nonigiri, just then...
58	5	Whoa whoa whoa whoa, Sena...\nDon't you think you're taking it a bit far?
59	3	Yeah, love... Did you lose your brain\nat the gym or something?
60	4	I'm sorry, Sena.\nI don't think I see what you're after here.
61	6	Whoa, when did everyone get so mean?\nI think it's a great name, "Segiri"...
62	1	Y-yeah, I think so too, actually.\nIt seems really, uh, friendly, somehow...
63	2	Ahaha! It's not really like you to\ncome out with something like this, Sena.
64	6	R-really...?\n...Well, maybe so...
65	6	But Mimi, I don't think it's right to...\ncall a person by a number...
66	eW1	...
67	6	Hey, I'm sorry, I let my mouth run away\nfrom me. I understand if you felt hurt by it.
68	eW1	...Regulations contain no special\nprovisions on restricting designation.
69	6	Huh?
70	eW1	No. 7 has no authority based on which\nto reject proposed designations, whatever\nthey may be.
71	6	...Does that mean we can call you "Segiri",\nand you won't mind?
72	dW1	...Affirmative.
73	3	Well, there you have it then, affirmative.
74	2	Nicely done, Sena.
75	6	Yeah, thanks!
76	6	The girl might still be a total mystery,
77	6	but really, it wouldn't have been right\nto call her "number seven"...

5	dW1	No. 7 will use own Iris as relay to\nforward the transmission to you.
6	pW103pW10	A pleasure to make your acquaintance,\nmy young Ouroboros friends.
7	pW103pW10	I am F, and before we go further,\nI would like to sincerely apologize for the\ndiscourtesy of this method of introduction.
8	30330	Ugh, what a shameless slug.\nHe thinks we'll forget he tried\nto kill us?
9	40340	You say you want to parley.\nHow do you imagine that will go,\nat this point...?
10	pW104pW10	I am certain you will feel guarded,\nand rightly so.
11	pW104pW10	And yet, with that acknowledged,\nI would like to offer an opening of\nnegotiations with you.
12	20320	Negotiations?
13	pW104pW10	Should you accept my invitation,\nI will rescind the extermination order\non you Ouroboros.
14	pW104pW10	Colony 0 will henceforth no longer concern\nitself with your comings and goings.
15	50350	Oh, that'd be swell! ... If we were stupid\nenough to trust your word.
16	10310	And your demands?
17	pW104pW10	...The bodily return of No. 7.
18	6	Huh...?
19	10410	...And that's it? That's all it would take\nfor you to never fight with us again?
20	pW103pW10	Yes. You have my guarantee, and that of\nthe whole of Colony 0.
21	30430	Are you joking? You're Moebius. You'd\nthrow away one or two soldiers without\nbatting an eye.
22	pW104pW10	Certainly, some Consuls do display such\ncallousness. A deplorable state of affairs...
23	pW104pW10	But not I. I hold the light of life\npossessed by Colony 0 to be of\nthe utmost importance.
24	pW104pW10	Naturally, that includes No. 7.
25	pW104pW10	That is precisely why I have reached out\nto you, nominally my enemies, even with\nthe concomitant difficulties acknowledged.
26	60360	Are you telling the truth?
27	5	C'mon Sena, don't fall for it...
28	60360	Can you give us a guarantee that\nyou aren't lying to us right now?
29	pW104pW10	Of course! ...Is what I would love to say,\nbut naturally, simple words are never\nenough to engender trust, I know.
30	pW104pW10	I have sent the current coordinates\nof Colony 0 to No. 7.
31	pW104pW10	We shall remain here. Should you find\nyourselves receptive to my offer, do please\npay us a visit, and bring No. 7 with you.
32	10310	So you think giving us your location\nwill make us trust you?
33	40340	How do we know this isn't a trap?
34	pW104pW10	In such a circumstance, you would possess\na handy hostage in No. 7. I trust I needn't\nsay more?
35	50350	Ugh...\nHas this guy heard the way he sounds?
36	pW103pW10	Of course, that is not what any of us\nreally want. My desire is to see No. 7\nsafely returned to me. That is all.
37	pW103pW10	...No. 7.
38	dW104dW10	Yes.
39	pW103pW10	I am tasking you with guiding them\nto Colony 0. Follow their command\nuntil your return.
40	dW104dW10	Compliance.
41	pW104pW10	...And, No. 7?
42	dW103dW10	Yes.
43	pW104pW10	We've all been worried about you.
44	dW103dW10	...
45	pW108pW10	That will be all. I will eagerly anticipate\nthe day when we meet in more favorable\ncircumstances.
46	dW1	By the Consul's authority, No. 7 is hereby\nassigned to the Ouroboros' command as an\nexceptional measure for the duration.
47	dW1	Pending your decision on the outcome of\nthe proposed exchange, I await your\ncommand to depart.

1	6	Of course I don't, not entirely.\nI know it could be a trap, as well.\nBut still...
2	6	If... And this is a big "if", OK? If he was\ntelling the truth earlier, then we won't have\nto fight with Segiri and her friends...
3	6	And more importantly, I'm sure there are\npeople waiting for her there...
4	6	So for all those reasons, I thought...
5	1	...Well, either way, things can't\nstay like this forever.
6	4	Rather than make speculation after\nspeculation and do nothing, you want\nto set something in motion.
7	2	It's also possible, if unlikely, that we\nmight be able to talk it through...
8	1	All right. Can you tell us where\nColony 0 is right now?
9	dW1	Aetia region, Captocorn Peak.
10	6	Huh? Wait, isn't that...?
11	3	That's where we fought against\nthose guys, ain't it?
12	dW1	The point where Colony 0 is stationed\nis located even further in.
13	5	That explains why you were\nlying in wait for us there.
14	dW1	However. The geographical feature\ncalled the "Nocclia Mire" is located\nen route.
15	dW1	Entering it is predicted to have severe\nnegative impact on your biological\nprocesses.
16	2	Then how do you guys get through?
17	dW1	A Ferron's environmental hazard\nresistance can temporarily neutralize\npoisonous materials.
18	6	What's a "Ferron"...? ...Oh, is that the thing\nyou were riding inside?
19	dW1	Affirmative.
20	dW1	Consequently, traversal through the\nafflicted area will necessitate retrieval and\nrefurbishing of the abandoned Ferron suit.
21	1	We can ask Riku to fix it up.\nWill that be OK with you?
22	dW1	No objections.
23	8	Oh, if Riku must. Will not\nleave friends in lurch.
24	6	All right then. Just be patient for us\na little while longer, OK, Segiri?

1	1	We've brought your soldier, as you asked.\nSo what now?
2	pW1	Hmm... No. 7 seems uninjured.\nThank you for this magnanimous measure.
3	pW1	As promised, Colony 0's order to\neradicate Ouroboros will be rescinded.
4	pW1	You have my word that we will never\nagain darken your doorsteps, figuratively\nspeaking.
5	3	Hah. Talk is cheap, man.
6	pW1	Oh, I assure you, the soldiers of Colony 0\nare most faithful. They would never\ndisobey an issued order.
7	pW1	What's more, I personally have nothing but\nthe deepest respect for you all.
8	pW1	After all, you did tend to my dear No. 7,\nand brought her back to me unscathed...
9	pW1	I offer you my sincere, heartfelt thanks.
10	5	Yeeaah, all right...
11	3	This doesn't sit right with me...
12	pW1	Oh! I have just had the greatest idea.\nNo. 7, you and our guests have traveled\nlong and far to arrive here.
13	pW1	Why don't we introduce them to the\nrest of the Colony 0 personnel?
14	dW1	Compliance.
15	1	Uh, I think we're actually fine...
16	pW1	Nonsense, no need to be shy.
17	pW1	We need to tie a bond of trust between\nus, and where better to start than with\na round of introductions?
18	6	Segiri, are you all right with that?
19	dW1	The Consul's word is absolute.\nNo. 7 does not have the prerogative\nof choice.
20	pW1	No. 7, show your face to everyone.\nI'm sure they'd like that.
21	pW1	No. 4 has also been worried about you.
22	dW1	...Yes.
23	6	No. 4?
24	pW1	No. 4 is No. 7's right-hand man.
25	pW1	With No. 7 absent, he had to\ntake over the reins instead.
26	3	He means like being an aide, then?
27	6	...Segiri, does that make you\nthe commander?
28	dW1	Parts of the definition appear discrepant,\nbut on the whole there are no major issues\nwith that denomination.
29	6	You could've told us, you know...
30	dW1	I have no record of the fact being queried.
31	1	You've noticed it too, right, Taion?
32	4	Yeah, and I can't make sense of it.\nThe Consul's attitude is one thing,\nbut more importantly...
33	1	The Ferronis. The one thing a colony\nneeds, and there's no sign of it here.
34	1	Or maybe... Maybe it's just\nsomething completely different\nfrom the colonies we know?
35	4	A special unit under direct\nMoebius command... Were we\ntoo hasty, coming here?
36	1	For Sena's sake, and for that girl\nshe trusts, let's hope not.

0	6	Segiri... What just happened...?
1	pW1	No. 4 has given his life to the Ferron.
2	5	Oi, you'd better explain yourself.
3	pW1	The Ferrons are powered by life's flames.
4	pW1	The Flame Clocks that impel them are\nsynchronized to those of their passengers.
5	4	Wait, did you say Flame Clocks?\nDoes that make the Ferrons...?
6	pW1	Indeed. The design differs, but\nyou could see them as functionally\nidentical to Ferronises.
7	pW1	In addition, Ferron Flame Clocks are fitted\nwith the function to disengage the limiters.
8	1	"Disengage the limiters"...?
9	pW1	Doing so allows the Ferron to burn through\nthe flames that fuel it at an accelerated\nrate, maximizing the unit's power output.
10	pW1	Once the limiter is disengaged, a first-term\nsoldier can perform at a level comparable\nto a colony's commander...
11	pW1	That incandescent power is the\npith and marrow of the Ferron's,\nof Colony 0's might.
12	4	...But what *is* Colony 0, to begin with?\nWho are you, who are its soldiers?
13	pW1	You could say we are those who work\nbehind the scenes of this war.
14	pW1	Battlefield manipulation, inciting sedition,\ninformation control, elimination of third\nparty forces...
15	pW1	It's all due to our ceaseless, thankless efforts\nthat this war can continue unabated,\nand each life's fate arrives as ordained...
16	pW1	In other words, we maintain the fabric\nof the world. That is the duty which is our\npleasure to fulfill.
17	4	Nothing but empty words. That's the\nreason you put your men in those things?!
18	3	Well mate, you just showed us your\nwhole arse. I knew you didn't care about\nthe lives of your soldiers after all!
19	pW1	Preposterous!
20	pW1	I treasure their lives above any\nother good! They are, to me,\nthe most exalted substance!
21	pW1	Their immaculate lives, sacrificed in service\nto the world, permeate it and form the\nbasis of the eternity we Moebius covet...!
22	6	...Stop it.
23	pW1	Protecting my innocent lambs whose souls\nlubricate the gears of the world through a\nsublime sacrifice - that is the highest calling!
24	pW1	Isn't it the loftiest vocation conceivable?\nSurely you must agree-
25	6	Shut up already!
26	pW1	...Ah, I must beg your pardon.\nHave I said something to incur\nyour displeasure...?
27	6	Snuff all of that, and snuff you!
28	6	How dare you... How could someone like\nyou think for a second you treasure Segiri!\nYou have no right!
29	6	We'll bring you down, right here and\nnow... Segiri and everyone will be free\nfrom the Flame Clocks!
30	pW1	...But what in the blazes has brought this\non? I told you from the start, I had no\nintention of fighting you...
31	5	Have you lost your mind?!
32	pW1	...Well, it seems unavoidable, now.

0	dW1	With the Consul's death in the line of\nduty, Colony 0's chain of command\nis broken.
1	dW1	No. 7 currently has no duties to perform,\nand no orders to follow.
2	6	That means you don't have to fight us\nany more.
3	dW1	However, it is a matter of record\nthat No. 7 took hostile action\nagainst Ouroboros.
4	dW1	Perhaps you wish to mete out an\nappropriate punishment.
5	6	Segiri, you did nothing wrong!\nReally, we should be thanking you.
6	dW1	Thanking...?\nWhy would...that be?
7	6	I mean... Before, you attacked the Consul\ninstead of us, so...
8	6	You held back from fighting us,\nand thanks to that we were able to\ntake down the Consul.
9	dW1	Hmm...
10	6	Anyway, that's enough about that.\nNow it's time to think to the future, right?
11	dW1	...I cannot comprehend.
12	6	Huh?
13	dW1	Why do you speak to No. 7 that way?\nUnder what orders, and from whom?
14	dW1	Why did No. 7 disobey orders?\nWhy did I not attack you as instructed?
15	dW1	Requesting swift reply.\nFurthermore, requesting orders.
16	6	Segiri...
17	dW1	No. 7...is confused.\nI do not know what actions to take.
18	6	...I know what it's like to feel lost,\nuncertain, not know where to turn.
19	6	But even you must have some things\nyou think you'd really like to do, right?
20	dW1	...No. 7 does not have thoughts\nmatching that description.
21	6	In that case, let's put our heads together!\nLet's think of things you might wanna do.
22	dW1	...Is that an order?
23	6	Nuh-uh. Nobody's giving you\norders any more.
24	6	From now on, Segiri...\nThe only orders you should\nfollow are your own.
25	dW1	(gasp)
26	dW1	...The situation described does not conform\nto the accepted definition of "orders".
27	6	I-it was just like a metaphor!\nOr... Or was it a simile...?
28	dW1	I really cannot comprehend.
29	6	Uhh...
30	dW1	But although I cannot comprehend...
31	dW1	"Segiri gives orders to No. 7."
32	dW1	If the circumstances be interpreted\nthis way, then Segiri...I...may be able\nto comprehend.
33	6	Oh, Segiri...
34	dW1	Is it...odd?
35	6	...No, I don't think so.\nI'm sure it's exactly right.
36	6	Since after all, you're free now.
37	6	So, Segiri?\nWhat are your orders for "No. 7"?
38	dW1	Top priority should be to investigate what\nit is that I "want to do". More data must be\ngathered before this is ascertained.
39	6	Ahahah... That sounds very like\nyou, but I think you're making it\ntoo complicated.
40	6	It doesn't have to be just one thing,\nand it can be anything, really!
41	dW1	It can be...anything?
42	6	Yep, anything at all.
43	dW1	In that case...
44	6	Yes? Did you think of something?

0	1	By the way, I wanted to ask about\nthe Ferron... I suppose there's no way\nto use them any more?
1	dW1	That statement is incorrect.
2	6	Oh, really?
3	dW1	Motive function can be restored by\nswitching to alternative power source\nusing ether cylinders.
4	dW1	Power output will be inferior to the original\nFlame Clock system, and the limiter can't\nbe removed, but shouldn't hinder combat.
5	dW1	...I will be able to fight on.
6	1	Wow, that's great news.\nDo you think we can ask you\nto fight by our side again, then?

16	so1	In time, you will discover its purpose.\nBut if you were to abuse it...I may have\nto dispose of you.
17	so1	It seems you can use your heads,\neven if just a little. I will choose\nto trust in my late friend's words.
18	3	Gee, that makes us feel a lot better.
19	so1	I meant what I said.
20	2	So now what?\nWhat will you do after this?
21	3	Save your breath, Mio.\nIt's not like he'll answer you anyway.
22	so1	I have something to take care of.
23	3	Oh, so you'll answer *her*?!
24	5	Even if it puts soldiers on your trail?
25	so1	Naturally.
26	3	All right, well, that's the end of that then.\nYour life, your choices, man.
27	so1	Hey...
28	3	What now...?
29	so1	Don't die, you lot.
30	3	Huh?
31	so1	If you need me, you can call me.\nI'll assist.
32	5	Uhh, that's rich coming from a guy\nthat just tried to kill us.
33	so1	It was a warning...\nAnd a small test.
34	3	What's this crap now?\nHonestly, I don't get this dude.
35	so1	I simply followed my friend's request.
36	3	And your friend, that'd be... Who?
37	1	When you say you'll help us...\nWe can just take you at your word?
38	so1	Either way, I can't have the bearers of\nthat thing running around unsupervised.
39	5	Doesn't exactly inspire confidence, but, eh.\nHe's strong, so that's something.
40	3	That's an awfully kind offer there,\nmister, but we don't even know what\nto call you.
41	3	'Bout time we got a name,\ndon't you think?
42	so1	...Hrrm.
43	3	Whoa, hey, stop right there!\nYour name, spark you! Spill it!
44	R	Gray... Call me Gray.
45	3	...What was that guy's deal?
46	5	Snuff if I know. Although he didn't\nlook like a bad... Uh, I guess he kinda\ndid look like a bad guy, huh?
47	4	There does seem to be more to this story\nthan we've seen so far...
48	6	Just, no fighting him again please...
49	3	Yeah, seconded. Punching his kind's\nnot even all that satisfying.

1	4	They look like Nopon traders.
2	5	What are they dancing out there for?
3	2	Shall we ask?
4	3	Hey, you.
5	pi1	Meh? Looking for bargains?
6	5	What's all this dancing about then?
7	pi1	Sometimes Nopon just want to dance.\nIs there law against?
8	pi1	Already ate dinner.
9	4	You dance after eating?\nThat's pretty unusual.
10	pi1	Not even slightly unusual.\nWhat silly maniac dance while eating?
11	5	Nobody said anything about that!
12	6	OK, anyway, so why were you dancing?
13	pi1	Because just ate dinner\nwith legendary Tempapa!
14	pi1	Never have Selfifi been this happy!\nSo glad to come on journey!
15	3	Legendary Tempapa?\nWhat makes him a legend?
16	9	Meh-meh! Did friend say Tempapa?!\nTempapa is real?!
17	2	Is he famous?
18	9	He very famous! Does cooking so tasty\nit make face melt! Legend among Nopon!

21	pi1	He here till just now!\nChase after and you catch him!
22	9	Manana must go!\nDate with destiny as apprentice!
23	5	Wow, he even takes apprentices?
24	pi1	Selfifi saw him go in direction of\nDaedal Isle, so go there to meet him.
25	9	This best news of Manana's life!\nManana going to become apprentice!
26	8	Is worth shot.
27	3	Uhh, we're just gonna go along with this?

4	hj1	Oh, today is good day for meeting Nopon!
5	hj1	Well! Now is time to go home.
6	9	Now is time to wait!
7	hj1	What-what?
8	9	Manana has request to make of Tempapa!\nPlease take Manana as apprentice!
9	wi1	Thank you for help, but I am\nafraid that impossible.
10	8	Why? Is it against personal\ndoctrine to take apprentice?
11	wi1	I not need disciple, that all.\nBut there another thing...
12	wi1	Use precious tool of trade for walloping?\nThat simply inexcusable.
13	wi1	Pot is for cooking, not bashing.\nTempapa cannot teach people who\ndisrespect tools in such manner.
14	9	Meh...
15	wi1	And anyway, Nopon who so influenced\nby humans is not good thing.
16	8	...That unnecessary.
17	wi1	Why you two travel with humans?\nNopon- No, no, that irrelevant.
18	wi1	But Nopon have always lived\nat distance from humans.
19	wi1	So, those are reasons\nwhy I not teach you.
20	9	...Manana understand.
21	5	...The spark is with this guy?\nWhat do you say to that?!
22	8	Wait!
23	wi1	...What now?
24	8	You say those things after\nyou eat cooking of Manana.
25	8	You tell by taste if Manana\nrespect her tools or not.
26	9	Riku...
27	3	You can at least do that, right?\nYou can't be in that much of a hurry.
28	wi1	...I accept. Seem like I have no choice.\nAs thanks for helping Tempapa, I go along.
29	5	It's a done deal!
30	8	Manana, is possible?

4	wi1	Let me have taste.
5	wi1	Hm, just as thought.
6	9	How was it?
7	wi1	Ordinary.
8	9	Meh-meh?! So, no good?!
9	9	Dinner is serve!
10	wi1	This easy to eat.
11	8	Meh? Has good mouthfeel, yes?
12	wi1	Is not to my liking.
13	9	Nooo!

2	9	This pride and joy of Manana!\nPlease to feast eyes on it...\nCerise-Caprice Acqua Pazza!
3	wi1	Oho, this certainly something... (sniff-sniff)
4	9	Eat while still hot!
5	wi1	Yes, yes...
6	9	How is Manana as cook?
7	wi1	...
8	4	Well? Did it not agree with you?
9	9	Oh no, is Manana terrible cook?!
10	wi1	Come with Tempapa.
11	1	Where are you going?
12	8	We want to hear impressions\nof Manana's cooking!
13	wi1	No more yak-yakking. Just follow.
evt/tq/msg_tq010805f.json
0	wi1	Here is house of Tempapa.
1	5	This is more like a hidey-hole\nthan a house.
2	wi1	Correct. Nopon must live\nfar from humans.
3	1	Are you sure you don't mind\nbringing us here?
4	wi1	Well it's not good, but when this\nfinish, I move house.
5	wi1	I bring friends here to say\nthankings for meal.
6	wi1	Cooking of Manana is...not bad.
7	9	Ohoho? Really?!
8	wi1	But it also not good.
9	2	So...it was bad?
10	9	It not tasty?
11	wi1	Taste was not bad, but that all.
12	wi1	Your problem is cooking utensils,\nand making best use of cooking utensils.
13	8	Making best of utensils? But food of\nManana should already be scrummy!
14	wi1	Adequate scrummage. Not great.
15	9	It not great?
16	wi1	Correct! Tempapa cannot allow food\nthat is not great!
17	9	How can Manana become great?\nPlease teach!
18	wi1	It something that cannot be taught.\nExcept...
19	wi1	Tempapa have list of things\nthat friends ought to fetching.
20	3	So now we're going shopping?
21	1	And these things will make\nManana's cooking even better?
22	wi1	Well.
23	wi1	First go to see Samon\nand get particular thing.
24	2	You know Mr. Samon?
25	wi1	Correct. Item is written on this\npaper. Samon will understand.
26	9	Manana and friends go obtain!
27	wi1	Other things can be collect.\nFinding should be-
28	8	Yes, yes, understood. Riku and friends\nfind things for Tempapa.
29	5	I've got questions, but if this makes dinner\ntaste even better, there's no way I'm\ngonna pass up the chance!
30	4	...It cannot be denied that Manana's\ncooking has been indispensable thus far.
31	1	OK, then let's go and\npay Mr. Samon a visit.
evt/tq/msg_tq010806f.json

5	gl1	...Right now is busy time.\nEven if give paper, Samon\nnot sure what friends ex-
6	5	What? What is it?
7	gl1	You met with Tempapa?
8	9	Yes! It Tempapa who\nask us to do favor.
9	gl1	How you meet with him?\nIs unbelievable.
10	2	Is Tempapa a friend of yours?
11	gl1	Friend? That guy?
12	gl1	Meh, is nothing gained\nby such conversation.
13	8	He tell us to fetch certain item.\nCan you provide item?
14	gl1	As usual he use Nopon for errand.\nRude. Why friends do this?
15	9	He make Manana apprentice in return!
16	gl1	Apprentice? What nonsense you thinking?
17	9	Tempapa legendary cheffypon!\nIt also precious ambition of Manana!
18	gl1	Cheffypon...? He become cheffypon\nwhen Samon not looking?
19	5	Huh, you didn't know?
20	gl1	He always show up out of blue\nto trade weird stuff.
21	gl1	Recently he not show up at all.\nSamon thought he most likely\ndead in ditch somewhere.
22	gl1	So, this what Tempapa want.\nTake and get gone.
23	1	Oh, thanks...
24	gl1	Tell Tempapa this thing from me.
25	gl1	"It not kill Tempapa to bring things\nSamon like every once in while."
26	8	We tell him.
27	gl1	And tell him to bring back\nHard Iron he take two years ago.
28	gl1	And Samon still waiting for\npayment for use of anvil!
29	8	Meh, how many things\nyou want us to tell?!
evt/tq/msg_tq010807.json
0		Yes, amount this size may just suffice.
1		What is purpose of use?
2		Cooking of Manana...\nProblem is that it lack tools, technique and soul.
3		Now even more things missing!
4		To get best out of ingredients, must use condiments.
5		And to get best from technique, need special something.
6		Can teach special something?
7		That question.\nWait here for tick.
8		(yawn)
9		Just how long this going to take?\nMaybe he steal away goods and scarper with?
10		Who steal away and scarper with?
11		I upstanding Nopon with spotless reputation.
12		Manana thought Tempapa disappear for good.
13		When old like me you understand value of nap.\nStay up all night is out of question.
14		So Tempapa just...went away for taking nap?
15		That right.
16		Nap has reveal wisdom to Tempapa.
17		Oho! What this?!
18		It a pot.
19		But Manana have one of those too.
20		Oh I think not. Not pot like this.
21		Sad to say, but pot of Manana\ncannot make up for lacking things.
22		It heavy-duty exclusive Nopon-brand pot!
23		User choose tool of trade, it true,\nbut also fact that tool choose user.
24		Pot of Manana, shape become all\nwarped from use in battle.
25		Now it not quite perfect fit.
26		Meh-meh! That was problem?!
27		What is exact point of wielding cooking-pot as weapon?\nThat fly over head of Tempapa.
28		But that not all.
29		How Manana is so careless with utensil, even\nwhen show such great promise as cheffypon!
30		Is true.\nThis pot suit Manana down to ground!
31		The more Manana cook with,\nthe better Manana cook.
32		Then even if use in battle, it not warp.
33		Meh?! You give Manana cooking-pot?!
34		Cooking of Manana...not actually so bad.
35		But tools simply not able to keep up with level of skill.
36		That make cooking sad, and utensils sad too.
37		Ahh. So that's why her technique\nand tools aren't up to scratch.
38		That right. Is all question of feeling.
39		Love is very important thing for technique and cooking.
40		Um, what about...
41		Teaching us some actual cooking?
42		What talking about now?\nTempapa not specially so much of cook.
43		Word on creepvine was\nTempapa legendary cheffypon.
44		Tempapa just make new cooking utensil,\nnothing more.
45		Cooking of meals...\nThey just to make sure utensil work.
46		Meh-meh! Then that mean...Tempapa\nnot actually legendary cheffypon?!
47		Oh, am well aware that\nsome Nopon call Tempapa that.
48		Tempapa choose not to refute spreading rumor.
49		That all there was to it.
50		What did you just say? Please tell me I misheard.
51		It nice feeling to be complimented!
52		Pictured as cool lone wanderpon!
53		Ugh... Can't believe this.
54		It OK. Manana not mind at all, Lanz.
55		Manana learn ins and outs of cook-pot!
56		To make tippest of top food,\nhaving of best utensils is required.
57		Manana would never realize this\nif not learn lesson from Tempapa!
58		That alone...make Tempapa\nworthy of title of Masterpon!
59		Only one thing left!
60		Manana can't wait to get stuck in with making food!
61		Get pot used to fire nice and slow.
62		That surefire secret to make\ncooking of Manana really shine.
63		Manana ready!\nAll of technique and soul!
64		Also spirit and personality.
65		Gettin' a bit much...
66		O-ho-ho! And pinch of motivation!

5	3	What?
6	wi1	Though it also plenty true that beloved\ntool will create beloved food.
7	4	But you still consider it unthinkable\nto wield as a weapon?
8	wi1	Truth be told, that part still rub\nTempapa wrong way.
9	wi1	But from initial impression of cooking,\ncould tell Manana made with talent,\nwithout understanding of how to use tool.
10	wi1	That was thing that really\nneeded correction.
11	8	Is Tempapa eating well?
12	wi1	Tempapa only eat little.\nCannot gorge self like young buck.

1	2	Definitely, the atmosphere feels\ndifferent to how things were, even\na little while ago.
2	A	Perhaps the change isn't a vast one,\nbut something is indeed different.
3	A	If we hadn't met you, perhaps this\nchange wouldn't have taken place.\nWe'd have retreated into our shells.
4	1	All we did was give things a little push.\nI'm sure you'd have managed this by\nyourself, Isurd.
5	A	Hm. You are most kind.
6	A	Either way, that doesn't change the heap\nof problems I'm facing. They need fixing,\nbut I can only manage a few at a time.
7	4	It's not good if you push yourself\ntoo hard, Commander. Getting some\nrest is important too.
8	A	Rest? Hmm.
9	A	Not sure how I'd go about getting some\nrest... The way things are here, I always\nend up busy, almost without intending to.
10	6	I suppose as long as you're at your home\ncolony, things just turn out that way, huh...
11	5	And you know, we ain't exactly\nexperts in the art of taking a load off.
12	4	That reminds me...
13	1	Do you have an idea, Taion?
14	4	Well... This could turn out to be nothing...
15	4	But earlier, I heard a Nopon merchant\ntalking about something called a "natural\nspa".
16	A	A "spa"?
17	4	Supposedly it's in a remote place,\nnot easily reachable by people.
18	3	What's remoteness got to do with\ngetting poor Isurd here to relax?
19	4	The Nopon also said it contained lots of\nnutrients, stimulated metabolism, promoted\nblood circulation...
20	2	So you're saying, if we get our hands on\nthis "spa", then even Isurd could get some\nrest... He'll be able to recover, basically?
21	4	Like I said before, the information is\nquestionable. It's only something I heard\nin passing.
22	A	...Taion.
23	4	Commander! I'm sorry, I know it's\nhardly a credible source...
24	A	I think I like the sound of this!
25	4	Huh?
26	A	I say we go out and we find\nthis "spa" thing!
27	3	I'm not really one to talk, but I didn't\nthink you'd be so into this.
28	A	Well, I have a passing interest in things\nof that ilk. But...ah. I don't want to keep\nyou from your journey...
29	5	Nah, don't you worry about that.\nMore importantly, how do we\ngo about finding this thing?
30	1	Why don't we ask somebody in the City?
31	2	Right, better than just us racking our\nbrains about it.
32	A	My thanks, all of you.

1	_k1	Eh? Whassat?
2	2	We're looking for something\ncalled a "natural spa"...
3	_k1	Natural spa, eh? Hmmm...
4	_k1	Never seen such bounties of nature\nwith my own eyes, I'm sorry to say.
5	5	Bounties of nature?
6	_k1	What, don't you know even that?\nAh, I guess you younglings only\nknow what you know.
7	_k1	But if you ask around among folk my age,\nyou should find someone who can tell you\nall about 'em.
8	_k1	In fact, someone I knew once used\nto go searchin' for spas, but they're in\nelusive spots, never to be found.
9	6	Spots like...?
10	_k1	Well, you'd hear about them being in a\nforest, or under a cliff, or deep in some\ncave, but nobody could ever find 'em.
11	A	I see...

3	fl1	Haha, so you want a spa, do you?
4	2	Do you know something?
5	fl1	Sorry, sorry. It's just I hadn't heard anyone\ntalk about one in a good while.
6	fl1	That's a quaint pastime and no mistake.\nBut you know, a spa isn't something you\ncan just "have".
7	5	It's a pastime? You mean like a hobby?
8	fl1	Long ago, people used to go to\ngreat lengths looking for natural spas.
9	fl1	Soldiers tired from war would heal their\nwounds with their help, then come out\nready to fight again.
10	fl1	I guess you'd say a spa is something you\nimmerse in. It warms your core and soon\nenough you're better. So our records say!
11	A	The more we hear about this the\nstranger it sounds! You soak your\nbody...and it heals?
12	fl1	Right. Though I'm sorry to say, over\nhowever many decades they've all\nbut disappeared.
13	1	They can disappear?
14	fl1	Yep. You can go looking for one,\nbut I wouldn't hold out too much hope\nif I were you.

1	il1	Oh dear! Yes?
2	A	Do you know of something called\na "natural spa"?
3	il1	Never thought I'd hear anyone\nask about those ever again!
4	4	Oh? Do you know something?
5	il1	Why, yes, of course!\nPeople used to talk about spas\nuntil the Armus came home!
6	il1	It's a place where you could heal\nyour wounds, warm your spirit, and\nstrengthen bonds with your fellow man!
7	6	Wh-whoa, they did all that?!
8	il1	But I've never been to one, you see.\nIn fact, they say they all dried up\ndecades ago...
9	A	Don't they exist any more?
10	il1	They're not something you'd find\njust anywhere, and not many here\nin the City know about them.
11	5	But there's someone who might?
12	il1	There is! I think if there's\nanyone who can tell you, it's him.
13	il1	He's called... Give me a minute.
14	3	We're counting on you, love!\nIf we don't find it, Isurd here's\ngonna shrivel and die from stress!

1	4	To summarize, hardly much of anything,\nexcept that they can heal and restore you.

3	3	Look at this poor clod...Isurd's so haggard,\nI think we're gonna lose him.
4	A	Just how do I look to you...?
5	1	One thing's for sure, we're not gonna\nfind one with what we've got so far.
6	2	We've no clue where one actually could\nbe... Like, in a forest, under a cliff?
7	5	Yeah, realistically we can't just blindly\nsearch everywhere.
8	6	But it does sound kinda cool,\nright? Just soaking your body\nand somehow healing?
9	3	Yeah, but soaking in what?\nIt sounds a lot like a bath.\nIt can't just be a bath, right?
10	4	From the way they talked I thought the\nsame. But I've never been in a bath that\nhealed my wounds.
11	3	Maybe it's a question of\nusing the right soap?
12	4	Sir, I hate to think we've wasted\nyour time, but if we can't come up\nwith any more results...
13	A	Heh, I'm grateful for your concern, but\nhonestly I've been enjoying myself.
14	A	We might not find anything, after\nall our searching, but there's just\nsomething in all this talk...
15	A	Just hearing that gave my heart a\nmuch-needed jolt... Though that might\nnot be the best way to put it.
16	1	No, I think you have it right.
17	2	Yeah, I'd be lying if I said I didn't care\nwhat happens. Let's keep searching\nfor a little bit longer.
18	3	Then let's go ask the bloke that people said\nwould know about this whole spa business.
19	6	What, that trivia king guy?\nOr the supposedly-dead guy?
20	4	The report of his death could still turn out\nto have been a mite exaggerated.
21	1	We don't know whether trivia king and this\ndead-or-not guy are the same person,\nbut it's worth finding out.
22	A	I know I've said it before, but I've certainly\nsaddled you with a tough task...
23	5	Ah, enough of that! We're giving your\nspirits a lift and all that. Once we find this\nnatural spa, we'll chuck you right in it!
24	A	Haha! Then you had better really find it!
evt/tq/msg_tq010905f.json
0	A	Excuse me, kind sir.
1	zl1	What, what? A bunch of hoodlums.\nTrying to gang up on an old man, eh?
2	A	No, sir. We are searching for a natural spa.
3	zl1	...What did you say?
4	A	Uh, we're searching-
5	zl1	If it's spas you're asking about,\nI'm who you need to be talking to!
6	5	We are talking to you, mate!
7	zl1	Well then. So you're the kids going round\nmaking noise about spas! You think talking\nto me is the way to get at all my secrets?
8	zl1	You might be whippersnappers, but I can\nrespect that kind of grit!
9	6	Um... You think he actually knows\nanything?
10	2	I'm wondering.
11	4	We heard that there was someone\nwho knew much about spas, but that\nhe had passed away.
12	zl1	What did that old codger tell you?!\nI ain't dying anytime soon!
13	5	Mind telling us about the spas, then?
14	zl1	When I was young, I used to go\naround them all, and a lot. There were\nabout four of them.
15	zl1	The one I liked the most was\nthe Nordil Natural Spa.
16	zl1	At the time my back was killing me,\nbut one dip and it was healed. Amazing!
17	zl1	The odd thing was, it was just a footbath!\nI dipped my feet in and it healed my back!\nWhat genius came up with that, eh?
18	zl1	I only ever found four natural spas, but I'd\nalso heard rumors of another, secret one...\nI bet it'd do marvels for one's back!
19	3	Mate, we didn't come here to chat\nabout your flippin' back!
20	zl1	Eh?
21	1	We want to know where we can find a\nspa. If there's four of them, then you can-
22	zl1	Oh, they're long gone.
23	6	Whaaat?!
24	A	Gone...you say?
25	zl1	Thanks to kids like you, with your wars\nand whatever... They've been blown up,\nfilled in...
26	4	...Huh?
27	zl1	Natural spas need water that gushes out of\nthe ground. No gush, no spring. You might\nfind something if you start digging, though.
28	5	Dig. That's your advice?
29	zl1	Though in times like these, start digging\nholes and people'll think you're crazy.
30	4	Well, you certainly turned out to be a\nfont of knowledge. I don't regret this at all.
31	A	Don't take it to heart, Taion.\nWe tried our best. We'll just have to\naccept the result.
32	A	We may not have found a natural spa,\nbut the time we spent was still worthwhile.
33	4	I suppose, Commander...
34	zl1	You suppose, nothing! You should let\nsomeone finish when they're talking!
35	zl1	There is still the secret spa\nthat I couldn't find. Or, to be\nmore precise, there might be...
36	5	What, really?!
37	zl1	I heard this when I was still young, so it\nmight not be too credible...
38	zl1	But the rumor goes that there was one\nin the Brasa Geothermal Belt.
39	zl1	But I couldn't make it. The place was\ncrawling with monsters, inside and out.
40	A	So there is hope after all?
41	zl1	Long time ago lots of people took refuge\nthere, but not one of them came back.\nThat's how dangerous the place is.
42	zl1	So the spa might be there, it might not.\nThat's why I couldn't recommend the\nplace to you.
43	5	There we go then, eh Isurd?
44	A	Indeed! It might be there...it might not...\nThe more uncertain it sounds, the more\nit gets me excited!
45	3	Weirdo. What if it turns out\nto be a massive waste of time?
46	A	I never thought I'd get so excited at\nsearching for something unknown.
47	zl1	Hoho! Soak yourself in the spa the way\nyou're getting now and you're liable to\nbroil yourself to death!
48	A	Hmph. I'll take care.\nThank you kindly!
49	zl1	Oops, nearly forgot to tell you.
50	1	Hm?
51	zl1	How to properly use the spa!\nPin your ears back and listen.
evt/tq/msg_tq010906f.json
0	A	So, this is the "spa"...?
1	3	So it is just a great big stonking bath!
2	4	Looks can be deceiving.\nThey told us it has special properties,\nremember?
3	6	The humidity is insane...\nDo you think the water's hot?
4	1	Huh? Hold it, something's here!
5	A	Seems we're not the first visitors today.
6	2	Weapons ready!
evt/tq/msg_tq010907.json
0	5	Those guys... They healed up something crazy!
1	A	Was that...
2	A	an effect of the spa's waters?
3	3	Does it matter any more?\nNow you can just dive right on in.
4	6	Huh? But, err...
5	5	Right! Ready, Isurd?
6	3	As promised, time for us to chuck you in!
7	A	H-hold up!
8	A	I don't remember making any-
9	4	Wha-? What is the meaning of this?
10	4	Commander! Are you OK?
11	A	(gasp)
12	A	Other than my heart, I believe I'm quite all right,
13	A	thank you.
14	5	Just like the old man said.\nIf there's nobody there, it's good manners to jump right in.
15	4	Even so, that's not-
16	A	However, the water is good.
17	1	What does it feel like?
18	A	The temperature is very pleasant.
19	3	So like I've been saying, it's just a bath!
20	A	Look!
21	A	My wounds are closing as we speak!
22	2	Wow! So what that man was saying...\nIt wasn't entirely wrong, it looks like.
23	A	Yes...
24	A	Now that I'm in here...\nI don't think I ever want to leave.
25	5	Right, my turn then.
26	5	Oi. What's wrong with you? Everybody get in!
27	2	Huh?
28	A	My word... I'm healing in places I didn't even know I had!
29	A	Aren't you coming in?
30	A	The water's fine!
31	4	B-but I, uh...
32	5	(sigh) I'm coming back to life!
33	5	Uh, not that I was dead or anything.
34	6	Umm...
35	6	Would I...have to strip down?
36	1	Oh, right...
37	1	The old man, he did say there's a proper\nway for getting in the water.
38	2	But I- I mean...
39	2	R-right here?
40	5	Hey guys, where's your sense of culture?\nGet in already! You don't want it getting cold!
41	A	It's perfect for healing your wounds\nafter a grueling battle.
42	4	Um! B-but...Commander...
43	A	You can be hopeless...
44	A	Eunie, boot him in already, will you?
45	3	Roger that!
46	4	Now wait here a minute, Eunie!
47	4	I never said I was going in-!
evt/tq/msg_tq010908f.json
0	4	Spark! Why'd it have to end like this?
1	A	Hahaha! Taion, it's a good experience\nfor you! It wasn't so bad, was it?
2	4	Uh, well... Now that you ask...
3	3	Yeah, takin' a dip wasn't bad at all!
4	6	Right...
5	2	All my tiredness is just completely gone.
6	1	Did you enjoy your break?
7	A	I did. Thanks to you, I feel as if a weight's\nbeen lifted from my heart.
8	A	I believed I was working for\nthe colony, but really I was\nrunning myself into the ground.
9	2	So it was worth coming here.
10	A	It just shows that there's room in\nany heart to appreciate the finer things.
11	A	This has given me a lot to think about.\nAt some point I'll have to bring everyone\nin the colony here.
12	3	If you could make everyone fit.\nIn a space like this, people will have to\ntake turns. The lines will get long.
13	A	Heh, then perhaps we need to dig\nsome more holes. We might even\ndiscover some new springs.
14	6	You're really serious?
15	A	Once the fighting ends and people have\nmore free time, then I might give it some\nserious thought.
16	A	Digging a few holes shouldn't pose us\ntoo much of a challenge. We are miners,\nafter all.
17	A	But wait... If we can discover many more\nof these spas, we could bring in people\nfrom other colonies...
18	5	Uh-oh...
19	1	Looks like you've caught the\nspa bug, Isurd!
20	4	Times like this are when the commander\nshines the brightest.
21	2	Bet you're glad we helped him, Taion.
22	4	Yes. I think he's going to be\nan even greater help to us now.
23	A	Shall we be off?\nOur next objective awaits.
evt/tq/msg_tq011000f.json
0	2	It seems pretty lively over there.\nWhat's the occasion?
1	B	There's supposed to be some kind\nof cooking contest. Maybe they're\npreparing for it?
2	9	Ohoho!\nSomeone say cooking contest?!
3	5	You think they'd let me participate...?
4	6	Huh?! I didn't know you cooked, Lanz!
5	5	Me? Nah. I'm all about the eating!\nThink of all that grub!
6	6	Ah! Maybe I should join too...
7	tk1	Hey there, folks!
8	1	Travis. Monica.\nWe just heard about this cooking contest.
9	tk1	Yeah? It's kind of a tradition around here.
10	tk1	You know how the world is.\nCan't set foot outside without putting\nyourself in danger.
11	tk1	People are going stir-crazy,\nall shut up with nowhere to go.
12	tk1	They need a bit of light entertainment\nto diffuse some of that stress, so these\ncontests are kind of a regular thing.
13	D	This seems like the perfect opportunity\nfor you to join in.
14	5	To sample the food?!
15	tk1	Ah, I'm afraid the judges are selected\nby majority vote. They've already been\ndecided well in advance.
16	tk1	That said, the winning dishes do\nget shared among the audience.
17	2	So you'd like us to join as chefs?
18	9	Yes!!! Count Manana in! Manana been\nchamping at bit for cookery action!
19	3	Haha, yeah.\nThis event's pretty much made for Manana.
20	9	Word!
21	B	C-could I...
22	B	Could I join as well?!
23	D	I like your spirit.\nYou're both very welcome.
24	tk1	Looks like you'll have your work\ncut out for you, eh, Boss.
25	D	You said it, Travis.\nI'll let you prepare the Lucky Spice.
26	tk1	Awww, tch, crap!\nNot that stuff...
27	D	There are no binding rules, no themes\nto follow. You're free to make whatever\nyou like.
28	D	But you are expected to bring\nyour own ingredients.
29	D	Once you have them, take them to\nMichiba at her canteen. She'll hold onto\nthem for you.
30	9	Hearing loud and clear!
31	D	I'll see you at the contest then.
32	B	Looking forward to it!
33	9	Manana not pull punches!\nWe rivals now, Miss Miyabi!
34	B	Yes, let's do this!
35	6	Since when did you learn to cook,\nMiyabi? You never told me!
36	B	Haha. I've only dabbled, really.
37	5	Right. We'd better go out looking\nfor our ingredients, eh?
38	4	Hold on. We haven't even decided\nwhat we're going to make yet.
39	5	Uh-huh. Just testin' ya.
40	B	Before we decide, maybe we should\nask around the City first? See what kind of\nfoods they like, their favorite seasonings...
41	B	That should give us enough to\nmake a start on.
42	3	True, we need some kind of direction\nto start with before we can think about\nmaking anything.
43	1	Something on your mind, Mio?
44	2	I was just thinking, it's unusual for Miyabi\nto voice her interest in something like this.
45	2	Before, she'd always try to avoid\nanything that involved competition.
46	2	So this is...kind of a surprise.
47	1	Hah, I see.\nWell, all the more reason\nfor us to cheer her on.
48	2	Yeah.
evt/tq/msg_tq011001t.json
0	dl1	Are you taking part in the cooking\ncontest as well? I look forward to\nseeing your entries!
1	5	Yeah, we're gonna rinse this competition!
2	1	About that... You wouldn't happen to\nknow what kind of ingredients are\npopular around here, would you?
3	dl1	Hmm... Well, the City folk are quite partial\nto big, hearty meals. You can't go wrong\nwith that.
4	5	Hearty, eh?
5	dl1	We're always busy doing one thing or\nanother - perhaps that's why. We like our\nmeals with punch, and in large portions.
6	B	Yes, I can definitely see that being popular.
7	dl1	Haha, it's just my opinion, though.\nI can't speak for the whole City. But\nanyway, good luck!
evt/tq/msg_tq011002t.json
0	pl1	So you're entering the cook-off too,\nare you? Looks like we're getting another\ngreat turnout!
1	2	By the way, we wanted to ask...\nWhat sort of dishes did they present\nin the past contests?
2	pl1	Oh, we've had just about everything\nyou can think of. Strange delicacies,\ntraditional meals...
3	B	All sorts, then...
4	B	Um... So what sort of food usually\nends up being the favorite?
5	pl1	Oh, they love just about anything!\nDo whatever inspires you!
6	pl1	You can't really game the system,\nsince you only learn who the judges\nare going to be on the day.
7	2	That's tricky...
8	pl1	If it were me, though...\nI'd look for a flavor that would appeal\nto the widest audience.
evt/tq/msg_tq011003t.json
0	yk1	Meh?! Cooking contest?!\nThought had almost slipped off\nmind of Cubibi!
1	yk1	Quickly! Must engorge on\ndelicious dishes!
2	B	Haha! You look like you're looking\nforward to this.
3	yk1	Not look like. Am!
4	yk1	Cubibi has high hopes for real-deal\nmeal to make peepers pop!
5	3	So it's likely people'll want something\nwith a bit of oomph, yeah?
6	yk1	Unexpected dish is sure to take\njudges by wildfire! Fierce wave of\nemotion blaze through tastebuds!
7	4	Take them by surprise with a dish that\nleaves a powerful impression... That seems\nlike a good direction to lean in.
8	yk1	But whatever is presented, Cubibi still\nperfectly happy as long as meal is tasty!
9	3	Haha, so you don't even care!\nWell, I do see where you're coming from.
evt/tq/msg_tq011004t.json
0	uk1	Oh, the cooking contest!\nSo it's that time already...
1	6	Is it really as popular as they say?
2	uk1	Yeah, it is. Not just because of the contest\nitself, but because everyone gets a bite of\nthe winning dish.
3	uk1	I reckon a lot of people are looking\nforward to that part. I know I am!
4	uk1	But you know, I think I'd enjoy it more\nif it was something I could cook myself.
5	uk1	They always prepare nothing but the finest\ningredients. Must be tough finding all that...
6	uk1	I bet you could still make a delicious meal\nwith perfectly ordinary stuff...
7	B	Yes, put in a little effort and you can\nmake any meal tasty.
8	1	That's definitely one way of looking at it.\nInteresting...
evt/tq/msg_tq011005s.json
0	6	Everybody's super excited for this contest.
1	4	Most likely they're excited about getting\na taste of the winning meal.
2	2	...Hey, Miyabi?\nCan I ask you something?
3	B	Hm? Sure.
4	2	You didn't enter this contest just because\nyou wanted to win, did you?
5	B	...No, I didn't.
6	B	It's because I feel indebted to the\npeople of the City. I wanted to take this\nopportunity to show them my appreciation.
7	6	Aww, how sweet! That's just like you!
8	2	Yeah, you haven't changed a bit.\nYou've always been like this.
9	tV	Meh-hrm...\nRegardless of ulterior motive of Miyabi,\nManana is innit to winnit!
10	tV	Will not hesitate to clash with\nfull force of Manana might!
11	B	That's totally fine, Manana.\nGive it your all!
12	1	All right, let's go over what\nwe've learned.
13	5	From what we've heard, we should serve\na huge portion of something, with a flavor\nthat packs a wallop.
14	4	It seems that the presentation is also\nhighly regarded in addition to flavor.\nSomething that will deliver an impact.
15	1	An impact, huh...\nThat's setting the bar pretty high...
16	6	But others were saying they'd like\nhomemade dishes. Something they'd\nfeel familiar with.
17	2	Given that we don't know who the\njudges will be, it might be best to go for\nsomething neutral that everyone can enjoy.
18	3	So...doesn't this just mean that they'll\nenjoy pretty much whatever we throw\nat them?
19	B	In that case...I think I know\nwhat might be good to try...
20	tV	Meh heh heh...\nSecret weapon of Manana will\nguarantee surefire win...
21	3	Hmm? You're looking pretty confident\nthere, love.
22	tV	Meh heh heh...\nThat because Manana already thought up\nultimate recipe of ultimate delicious!
23	tV	Current name of dish...\nis closely guarded secret!
24	B	Haha! Yes, you don't want to be\ntelling your competitors.
25	tV	Exactly! Anticipation must be savored!
26	5	Looks like you two have already\ngot your entries sorted. Guess next up's\ngetting the ingredients?
27	6	What'll you need for your dish, Manana?
28	tV	Meh! Manana will need\nMottlemarble Aries Meat,\nKilljoy Crustip Meat...
29	tV	Cozy Rhogul Egggems\nand Lucky Marrin Thickcuts!
30	5	Huh... They're a pretty big deal,\nis what I'm getting here...
31	2	How about you, Miyabi?
32	B	Umm... Smushi Rice, Refreshing\nPiranhax Meat, Glitter Radishes...
33	B	and Soyprimo Sauce... Though we can\nprobably ask the City folk to share some\nwith us.
34	5	Huh... That all sounds like\npretty average stuff.
35	B	Yes, um... I'd really like to prepare\nsomething that anyone can make,\nusing familiar ingredients.
36	6	Yeah, you're totally winning\npeople over that way!
37	2	So, who to start with?
38		Whose ingredients will you gather?
39		Manana's
40		Miyabi's
41	2	We'll start with Manana's.
42	tV	Ohohoho! Manana pleased to welcome\naboard all affiliated parties!
43	2	We can start with Miyabi's.
44	B	Thank you. I hope you'll find them\nwithout much trouble!
evt/tq/msg_tq011006f.json
0	6	That's the last of Manana's ingredients!
1	9	Many thankings!\nFriends did bang-up job!
2	6	Now for Miyabi's...
3		
4	B	That's it! Thanks again!
5	B	We should talk to people in the City to see\nif anyone can give us the Soyprimo Sauce.
evt/tq/msg_tq011007f.json
0	B	Boxy...
1	Xm1	Oh, hey Miyabi!\nYou're with your friends today?
2	B	Yes, sorry if we're bothering you.
3	Xm1	Not at all, not at all!\nAlways nice to see you.
4	Xm1	So, what brings you here?
5	B	Actually, I've decided to enter the\ncooking contest...
6	Xm1	Oh, really?!
7	B	I'd like it if you came.\nI'm going to try as hard as I can!
8	Xm1	Sweetie, I would love to!\nI'll be cheering you on all the way!
9	B	There's one other thing...\nI have a request, if it's not\ntoo much trouble.
10	Xm1	Tell me. Anything I can do to help.
11	B	Would you mind sharing some of your\nSoyprimo Sauce? Your homemade recipe?
12	Xm1	My sauce is going to feature...?!\nThis just keeps getting better and better!
13	Xm1	Please, take as much as you need!
14	Xm1	I'm sure it'll be enough, but if by any\nchance you run out, just swing by again.
15	Xm1	Romero absolutely loves that sauce.\nI've got jars full of the stuff.
16	B	Thank you so much...!
17	Xm1	Haha! You're getting awfully\nworked up about all this.
18	Xm1	Just relax, and enjoy the experience.
19	B	Yes, ma'am!
20	B	...Ah.
21	Xm1	Hahaha! Now what did I just say?
22	B	Hee-hee!
evt/tq/msg_tq011008f.json
0	2	Great! That should be the last\nof Miyabi's ingredients!
1	B	Yes, I think so.\nThank you!
2	2	Now for Manana's. Hmm...\nWhat was on the list again?
3	9	Was Mottlemarble Aries Meat,\nKilljoy Crustip Meat...
4	9	Cozy Rhogul Egggems and\nLucky Marrin Thickcuts!
5	9	Might be bit tricksy for friends,\nbut Manana have confidence!
evt/tq/msg_tq011009f.json
0	2	That's all of the ingredients,\nfor the both of them.
1	9	Tippy-toppy job!
2	pl1	Got everything you need now?\nThen I think it's about time to start\nthe contest. Is everyone ready?
3		Are you ready?
4		You bet!
5		Hold on...
6	pl1	Oh, looks like you still need a bit of prep\ntime. It's fine, we can wait a little longer.
evt/tq/msg_tq011010t.json
0	pl1	The cooking contest's about\nto get started. All set?
1		Are you ready?
2		You bet!
3		Hold on...
4	pl1	That so... Well, we can wait a bit\nmore until you're prepared.
evt/tq/msg_tq011011f.json
0	tk1	Looks like both the chefs and\nthe judges are ready.
1	tk1	Well ladies and gents, it's time to\nstart another annual cook-off!
2	tk1	And who else to narrate the events as\nthey unfold but the City's number one\ncharmer...
3	tk1	...Just kidding - it's me, Travis,\nyour ever-affable Lost Numbers\nlieutenant.
4	tk1	Let's start by introducing our expert panel\nof judges... The lucky four adjudicators for\nthis year's incredible turnout are...
5	tk1	Drumroll, please...
6	tk1	Ghondor! You've been begging to be\na judge for ages now. Looks like it's\nyour lucky day!
7	Q	Oi. Don't you bloody patronize me.\nYou'll be laughing on the other side\nof your face if you're not careful...
8	tk1	Ahem! Moving swiftly on...
9	tk1	You fancy yourself an avid foodie?\nWell, let's see how you measure up to\nthe wise and erudite Wellwell!
10	tk1	Next up, a lover of music and all things\nlyrical... It's Mr. Boomer!
11	tk1	He's got a refined palate for music and\nfood, and I'm sure he's about to give us\na piece of his mind!
12	tk1	Last but not least, we have our\nyoungest judge on record!
13	tk1	Introducing San! Far as I can tell, he just\nplain enjoys food. He'll eat whatever you\ncan throw at him!
14	xk1	Heehee, yeah! Gimme all your food!
15	tk1	We want you four to judge the meals on\ntheir own merits, as honestly as possible.
16	tk1	Now let's introduce our chefs!

39	Q	Is this thing edible?
40	xl1	...Hrmph.
41	Q	Mmm! Hey, this is pretty tasty!\nAnd juicy!
42	al1	Contrary to expectation, taste pop and lock\ninside mouth... Big bang of umami fill entire\ntastebuds!
43	_k1	Hmmhmm, hm hm hmmm...
44	xk1	Hey, how're you s'posed to eat this?\nI don't get it...
45	tk1	Maybe Nissick would be kind\nenough to assist...
46	xl1	I beg your pardon?!
47	tk1	Let's check in with our next\nculinary combatant!
48	tk1	It's our very own boss!
49	Q	Heh... I'll find a chink in your armor...
50	D	My dish is the Monicurry Special!
51	Q	Oh, come on!
52	Q	How's that fair?!
53	xk1	Ah! It's got Tasty Sausages in it!
54	al1	Well, well, well! Wellwell only heard\nrumors, but Monicurry said to be\nlegendary meal among Lost Numbers!
55	vl1	...I'll have me some of that.
56	Q	Nngh, damn you, Bitchqueen!\nYou got the spiciness spot on!
57	_k1	Huff, huff, puff... Ooh! Slurp!
58	al1	These vegetables... Flavor normally\ndistinctive, yet subtly veiled here...\nAnd spiciness perfectly compensate...
59	al1	But despite this, single plate appear\npositively heaped with nutrition...? Is dish\nspice-renowned or something deeper...?
60	xk1	Hwah... It's making my tongue all prickly...
61	tk1	Oops. Guess the kid's tastebuds weren't\nquite prepared for that just yet...
62	D	Funny... Everyone normally loves the stuff.\nDid I add too much Lucky Spice...?
63	tk1	I'm sure your bellies are gradually\ngetting rounder, but there's plenty\nmore where that came from!
64	tk1	The next contender is...Manana!
65	9	Finally, time for big moment!\nDelicious dish of Manana is...
66	9	Secret recipe of Nopon, passed down\nin greatest of stealthy! Or rather, little\nspin on traditional version...
67	9	Doodlenoodles, Manana-style!\nPrepare for taste beyond taste!
68	xk1	That looks yummy!\nThis is gonna be awesome!
69	Q	Whoa! That's gonna be a banger.
70	al1	Tears of Wellwell might form small pool...\nTo think Nopon exist that could recreate\nrecipe of legend...!
71	8	O-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho...!
72	_k1	Hohoho! Hmhm! Hohohohoho!
73	xk1	Gimme more of this meat!\nMore! Moooore!!!
74	al1	Wellwell never dream of chance to eat\nperfect Doodlenoodles in lifetime...\nTaste is beyond compare...!
75	al1	Such level of extravagant.\nWellwell could well rocket\ninto skies above!
76	Q	How the crap is this so good?!\nI don't know what to say!

78	tk1	Take it away, Miyabi!
79	B	OK...!
80	B	Here's the meal I'll be presenting today...
81	_k1	Ooooh?
82	xk1	Huh. It doesn't look very special...
83	Q	I guess when you put it\nalongside the others, yeah...
84	al1	But it clearly made with love.\nPreparation of dish reflect nature of chef.\nAnd this no exception...
85	Q	Ah, it feels... How should I put it...?\nComforting.
86	al1	Mmmh, so understated, yet so palatable...\nHard to express in words... Like warmth\nfilling entire body...
87	xk1	I eat this fish all the time, but I don't\nthink it's ever been this tasty before!
88	om1	Gosh, I wonder how she prepared it...?\nI'd love to know.
89	uk1	Same! Why don't we go and ask her\nonce the contest's over?
90	om1	Mei, you have the best ideas!
91	Xm1	Now that looks scrumptious.\nThey look like they're loving\nthe Soyprimo Sauce, too!
92	_k1	Hm hm hm hmmm ♪\nHm hm hm hmmm ♪
93	_k1	Mmhmm. Tastes gooood.
94	tk1	Now, I hate to break it to you, folks,\nbut it's time for the judges to make\ntheir decision.
95	tk1	Which of these four outstanding meals\nhas satisfied their stomachs?! I'm sure\nyou're all on the edge of your seats...
96	tk1	The winner of this year's\ncooking contest is...!
evt/tq/msg_tq011012f.json
0	2	Congratulations, Manana!
1	9	Meh-heh-heh!\nFeels good at top!
2	2	Better luck next time, Miyabi.
3	B	Thanks, everyone.\nYou all helped me so much.
4	B	I didn't make first place, but I'm glad\neveryone got the chance to try my food.\nManana was kind enough to raise the idea.
5	B	Thank you, Manana.
6	9	Aww, not to mention!
7	9	Would be terrible shame for friends to\nmiss out on delicious nomnoms of Miyabi!
8	yl1	Nissick looks in a right mood.
9	xl1	I can hear you.
10	wl1	Can't let 'em get away with this though,\ncan we? We'll lend you a hand next time!
11	xl1	Hmph...
12	D	How d'you like the Monicurry,\nGhondor?
13	Q	Wh-why're ya asking me? Same as you always\nmake it. The name's dumb, though. Couldn't\nyou come up with something better?!
14	D	You say that every time. I don't see\nthe problem, personally. I actually\nkind of like it.
15	Q	I'm not asking YOUR opinion!\nI'm saying it's freakin' embarrassing!
16	D	I've still got some left, by the way.\nYou want a bowl, or not?
17	Q	Don't change the subject!\nAnd...of course I want a bowl!
18	B	Ahh, that contest was so much fun!
19	9	Maximum agree!\nPlus was big learning experience!
20	9	Can see Manana need to greatly\nexpand repertoire!
21	B	Ah...!
22	B	If that's your plan, would you mind\nteaching me some more about cooking?
23	9	Meh-meh? Even though Miyabi already\nplenty good at cooking?
24	B	Haha, I'm honored that you'd say so.
25	B	But I really don't have a lot of\nexperience. I'd love it if you\ncould teach me some more.
26	9	Ohoho! Then let Manana pick up\nwhat Miyabi putting down...
27	9	Miyabi asking to become\napprentice of Manana?
28	B	That's right! ...If it's not a problem?
29	9	No problem!\nManana welcome with open wings!
30	B	Oh, that's wonderful!\nThank you, Manana!
31	9	Ah, before Manana forget...
32	9	Should snaffle up recipes of Monica\nand Nissick while still have chance!
33	B	Oh, good idea!\nLet's do that!
34	2	Hey, Miyabi.

0		You did great there.\nYour food was amazing!
1		[ML:undisp ](happy breath)
2		I said before...that I did this...\nfor the City.
3		Of course, they were the\nhighest priority in my mind...
4		But really, it was for the both of you.\nI so wanted you to try it.
5		It was for us?
6		This world... It's filled with nothing but\ntragedy and hardship for us.
7		But now...after coming here,\nthat feels like a distant dream...
8		Yeah, that's right... You've always\nkept my wishes in your heart, haven't you?
9		That's why you brought me here, right?
10		Because we're alive,\nwe get to see these sights...
11		Thank you.
12		[ML:undisp ](wordless breath, filled with emotion)
13		No, Miyabi... Thank *you*.

0	1	What is this place...?\nAnd...is that a cradle?
1	C	I remember this room...
2	4	Anything you want to tell us, Cammuravi?
3	C	This is where I awoke,\nmet Miyabi and the others.
4	2	So that means that cradle is...
5	C	It is no simple cradle.\nFitted inside is a device which matures\na life to a state close to Homecoming.
6	1	That makes sense... So that's what Y used\nwhen reviving Mwamba and the others.
7	dn1	...Cammuravi, is that cradle still usable?
8	C	The installation works, just barely.\nWhy do you ask such a thing?
9	5	Uh, Ethel, you're not thinking...?
10	dn1	...Our enemies are supernatural beings,\nmonsters who use human lives for fodder.
11	dn1	You can all fight against them.\nBut me...?
12	dn1	As I am now, I'm barely able\nto protect myself.
13	dn1	All I can really do is hang back and watch,\nso as not to be a hindrance...
14	dn1	But... Suppose I was to use this cradle...
15	1	Ethel, you don't have anything to prove...
16	C	...As far as the choices available to you go,\nyou could also return to the City and live\na peaceful life.
17	C	And yet you're saying you want to throw\nyour body back under war's grindstone,\nand spend your life fighting...?
18	C	...But then, you were ever thus.
19	C	By the time you speak your mind,\nyour body and soul are long ready.
20	C	...I think you should do as you wish.
21	2	Cammuravi... Are you sure\nit's fine? To embroil her in what's\nultimately our fight...?
22	C	Ethel's path should be hers to choose.\nI am certain her resolve is firm.
23	C	If she wished for a life of peace,\nshe would not have followed us this far...
24	C	The Way must have been\ninside her all along.
25	4	I suppose that's true, yes, but still...
26	C	...I am anxious about the result,\nsame as you.
27	C	Nevertheless, as a devoted follower of\nnone other but the Warrior's Way myself...
28	C	...I wish to respect the will and resolve\nof one who has chosen the same path.
29	C	I believe Ethel's freedom is hers\nto do with as she wishes.
30	dn1	Thank you, Cammuravi...
31	C	At the same time, I am of course not in\na position to decide such things myself.
32	C	We have conveyed to you our desire.\nWould you tell us your opinion, in turn?
33	dn1	...
34	2	...Well, what should we do?
35		Have Ethel undergo the maturation\nprocess?
36		Yes
37		No
evt/tq/msg_tq011103f.json
0	1	...How are you feeling, Ethel?
1	7	Oh, never better. ...I mean that\nliterally. It's as though new strength\nis welling up inside of me.
2	7	This way I'll be able to fight by your\nside too. You have my thanks.
3	C	...Huh.
4	7	What's wrong, Cammuravi?
5	C	..."Silvercoat".
6	1	...Ah!
7	7	"Silvercoat"...? What does that mean?
8	C	I'm not sure... When I saw you just now,\nthe word simply came to me...
9	C	As though something was guiding me...\nWhat in the world...?
10	C	This sensation...\nFrom where did it spring...?
11	1	Cammuravi, I can explain...
12	7	What we should be thinking about now,\nis the future...
13	7	What we can achieve in unison... No?
14	C	...Huh...
15	7	I said I could be your eyes...\nThat has not changed.
16	7	Just as you showed me the Way before,\nlet me now be your guide.
17	C	...You are right.
18	C	You can see that which I cannot, indeed...
19	C	I wanted to live life true to myself,\nbut the answer is still not clear.
20	C	But perhaps, by working together\nwith you...
21	7	Let's search for the answer hand in hand,\nCammuravi. With unity between us, nothing\ncan be impossible.

0	Zl1	Let me get this straight: you want me\nto talk the defense squad into issuing you\na transporter?
1	Zl1	You're dreaming, young lady.\nOut of the question.
2	wl1	Please, sir...\nIt would only be for a short time!
3	Zl1	I don't suppose this is one of\nthe Elder's requests?
4	vl1	No, no, it's nothing to do with her...
5	ll1	Jansen.
6	D	Now there's something you\ndon't see every day.
7	Zl1	Ah, Elder. You came at the right time.
8	Zl1	Can you make these knuckleheads\nsee sense? I mean, it's good that they're\nso enthusiastic...
9	Zl1	Can you get it through to 'em that we've\ngot problems enough in the City already?
10	D	Everyone's all fighting to the best of\ntheir ability. I don't see the problem\nhere myself...?
11	Zl1	Don't see the problem...?
12	Zl1	We don't have a damned clue when the\nnext Moebius raid hits us and you "don't\nsee the problem"?
13	D	Come on now, Garrett...
14	Zl1	What we should be looking at\nright now is tightening our defenses\nand protecting the City.
15	Zl1	We can leave Moebius to Ouroboros.
16	D	Sounds like you're trying to overturn\nthe senate's orders.
17	Zl1	I'm just offering a bit of advice here.\nJust sayin' there's no point throwing\ngood resources after bad.
18	yl1	Hey! With all due respect-
19	Zl1	Don't you get it? You folks just haven't got\nwhat it takes to go against Moebius.
20	yl1	Wha-?!
21	Zl1	You've got to accept reality. Otherwise,\nyou're throwing your lives away for nothing.
22	3	For nothing?
23	3	Everyone's fighting to keep people like\nyou alive and you call that "nothing"?!
24	Zl1	You think you can trade in your life\nand change the world? You think it's\nthat simple?
25	2	But...if we do nothing,\nthen nothing will change.
26	Zl1	You fill the youngsters up with fine ideas,\nthen send 'em out to the slaughter.
27	Zl1	Yeah, some talent that is.
28	D	We don't force our way of life on anyone.
29	D	They're the ones who decide.
30	Zl1	Lemme ask you, then. Did you choose\nfor yourself? You chose this life personally,\ndid you?
31	D	...
32	Zl1	Your husband must be rolling in his grave.
33	vl1	My brother is dead.\nHe won't regret anything any more.
34	Zl1	You trying to mock me?
35	vl1	If it came across like that, I'm sorry.
36	vl1	But bringing up the dead to prove a point?\nIs that really something a Doyle would do?
37	Zl1	Bah.
38	D	...All right. You going to tell me\nwhat that was all about?
39	vl1	Ah, it's no big deal, really.
40	D	Thanks, but I'll be the judge of how\nbig a deal it is or isn't, Jansen.
41	vl1	Are you telling me that as Elder?
42	D	Jansen...
43	vl1	If you aren't pulling rank,\nthen please believe me.
44	vl1	I'm not a kid any more!
45	vl1	Olive! Plan B.
46	yl1	OK!
47	1	Hey, Monica.
48	D	You wanna grab a bite to eat?
49	D	I haven't eaten a thing since this morning.\nIt'd be great to have some company.
50	9	Someone say "eat"? Time for tasties!
51	2	Wind it in, Manana!
52	1	Sure thing.\nLet's go to Michiba Canteen then.
evt/tq/msg_tq011201f.json
0	9	Can second helping fit in tummy\nof Manana...? Hmmm...
1	8	Manana not even had firsts yet.
2	D	Eat whatever you like. My treat.
3	D	Keep bringing it out, will ya!
4	pl1	Gotcha!
5	D	Ah...
6	D	Where do I start...?
7	4	I knew there were a few people whose\nhearts weren't really in the fight against\nMoebius...
8	4	But I'm not sure I understand why\nthey're so openly bitter about it.
9	D	Please don't judge him too harshly.
10	D	Garrett just wants to protect his family.
11	2	His family...
12	D	Right. He has kids, just like I do.
13	D	That's why he can't forgive me.\nI did something no parent should ever do.
14	2	But, why... What did you do?
15	D	Sending your children into battle...\nWhat mother would do that?
16	D	But...this is the life I chose.
17	D	The day my husband died...
18	D	I chose to take the mantle of Elder\nand lead the City.
19	6	Remind me... A "husband" is...
20	1	Someone you promise to live with,\nfor the rest of your life. He must've\nbeen very important to Monica.
21	6	So...after you lost your husband, did you...\nbecome who you wanted to be...?
22	D	I did.
23	D	I wanted to put an end to the war\nwith Moebius.
24	D	And to build a way of life that\neveryone in this world truly deserves.
25	D	That's what the Six Houses are working\ntowards, and that's what I want as well.
26	pl1	Oh, sorry to keep you! Here it is:\nthe house special, Acqua Pazza à la City!
27	D	Thanks!
28	5	Ohhhh! Looks bangin'!
29	3	Actually, there's something I've\nbeen curious about.
30	3	Like, being Elder, or being a mother.\nDo you have to choose one or the other?
31	5	Guess it's like becoming the commander\nof a colony or something?
32	D	Yeah, that's a good comparison.
33	D	If you take on that role, you're responsible\nfor every single person that lives there.
34	D	So being Elder means Ghondor can't get\nspecial treatment, even though she's my\ndaughter.
35	3	Sounds like a tough break...
36	D06tk10	Boss! Got something you\nmight like to hear.
37	D04tk10	We confirmed an unauthorized transport\nleaving the City. It's piloted by Jansen and\nhis crew.
38	D03D0	What's its heading?
39	D04tk10	I'd like to know that myself.
40	D04tk10	The location tracker's out. Think it's safe\nto say they're planning quite the stunt.
41	D03D0	Right. Olive's there now.
42	D04tk10	Should we send the Armory?
43	D03D0	The search area's too wide.
44	1	Maybe...Garrett could help us?
45	2	Right! He was talking about the\ntransport in the plaza!
46	D03D0	Ya hear that?
47	D04tk10	I don't have a good feeling about this,\nboss.
48	D03D0	I'll speak to Garrett. You can do a little\ngroundwork for me, Travis.
49	D04tk10	Word gets around. Imagine the commotion\nonce the conservatives hear about this...
50	D03D0	Work your charms on them, Travis.\nI'll make it worth your while.
51	D08tk10	OK, Boss! Let's settle this squabble!
52	3	Looks like we'll be skipping lunch then.
53	6	Never mind. Let's just try to find out\nwhat Jansen's up to, and-
54	6	...Huh?
55	D	Speed-eating. You get used to it\nin my line of work.
56	D	We should get to the residential district.\nGarrett will be at home.
evt/tq/msg_tq011202f.json
0	Zl1	Yes, he was trying to scrounge\na transport off me.
1	Zl1	I told him "no".\nDidn't ask what he'd do with it.
2	D	I see.
3	Zl1	But whatever it was, I guess they\nwent and did it anyway. Or you wouldn't\nbe here asking about it.
4	Zl1	Every ruddy last candidate got together\nand went against their orders... Insane.
5	Zl1	It's like Shania all over again...
6	6	Ah...!
7	1	Or rather...maybe Shania was\nthe trigger for all this?
8	1	Maybe Jansen and the others are doing\nthis because of what she did.
9	Zl1	Huh?
10	4	They realized that no matter how\ngood the defenses were, the downfall\ncould still come from within.
11	4	And if they don't act, there's no future.\nIf you see it like that, it's not hard to\nunderstand.
12	3	But what are they trying to do right now?\nWe still don't have a clue...
13	3	They aren't selling the City out though.\nYou get that, don't you?
14	Zl1	If they're trying to help, it's a pretty dumb\nstunt to pull. How childish can you get?
15	D	Garrett.
16	Zl1	I just don't want them to watch them fail!
17	Zl1	All that blood, sweat, tears, pain... It does\nno good if they throw it all away! Why is\nthat so hard to understand?
18	Zl1	We need to teach them about the past and\nhelp them make the right choices *before*\ndisaster happens.
19	Zl1	That's our responsibility as adults!\nRight, Monica?!
20	D	...I understand how you feel.
21	D	But...Jansen's crew aren't fighting for\nvictory or glory here.
22	D	Right now, they just want to do something\nthat won't leave them with regret.
23	Zl1	Absolute Armu cack...
24	D	Y-yeah, maybe so...
25	D	But would you rather they were mindless,\nobedient automatons? How's that different\nto being controlled by Moebius?
26	Zl1	What...?
27	D	We need to get through to them so that\nwe can teach them how to get back on\ntheir feet after they fail.
28	D	We've seen a little more of this life than\nthem. And as you say, it's our job to help\nthem understand that.
29	Zl1	Well, well. What a surprise to hear the\nElder talking like a parent for a change.
30	D	Picked it up from my dad.
31	D	It's how he raised me,\nnow I think about it.
32	Zl1	Hmm... Yes, I can see that.
33	D	Anyway, thanks for your time, Garrett.
34	Zl1	(sigh) Don't mention it.\nSorry I couldn't be more use.
35	D	OK... Back to square one.
36	D06ml10	Ms. Vandham.
37	D04ml10	I was just on duty...\nDidn't mean to eavesdrop or anything.
38	D03D0	No problem. Continue.
39	D04ml10	I've got some information about\nthe location of that transport.
40	D04ml10	Kryto was talking about Corne Island.
41	D03D0	Corne Island, you say.
42	5	Maybe there's something to it.
43	D	Yeah...
44	D	My husband was there, 14 years ago.\nHe went out on a mission to collect ether...
45	D	That's where he lost his life.
46	2	What...? That's...
47	D	If they're heading to the deepest level,\nthen they're in trouble.
48	D	Even if they're sure of themselves...
49	2	We've got to get to Corne island!

6	D	Oh no...

3		[ML:undisp ]...
4		But what in the hell were you thinking?
5		It was for the City...
6		We thought we could seize the loot,\nmaybe use it to beef up our defense.
7		Even if we can't be Ouroboros,\nwe can still fight!
8		Monica, our duty...is to protect\nthe City from our enemies!
9		And, I mean...
10		We got the feeling...that we didn't really matter to you.\nLike we weren't real candidates.
11		The way you all just fought...
12		It easily surpassed even our top veterans.
13		But not even the great Guernica Vandham
14		could stand up to the horrors we're facing.
15		They'll chew you up and spit you out.
16		[ML:undisp ]...
17		And, if you were to lose your lives needlessly,
18		you'd leave behind more sadness.
19		I don't want any of you to forget that.
20		...Olive!
21		I'm gonna need a report.
22		So, when can I get it?
23		[ML:undisp ]...!
24		Uh... Tomorrow...?
25		I want it today.
26		Get these supplies stowed away.
27		Also...
28		I expect a written apology\nfrom all of you.
29		Fifty pages.
30		Fifty...?
31		Not enough?
32		In the very near future, we're gonna need\nabout everything you can give us.
33		Until then, you need to prepare-
34		But...*you're* out there on the front line.\nPutting yourself in harm's way.
35		At least let us handle the rear.
36		Please, just trust us.
37		You little...
38		When my brother died...\non the day that you were made Elder...
39		I decided...
40		I pledged...never to leave you alone.
41		I would not let you end up like him.
42		And so...that's exactly what I'm doing here.
43		Somehow...
44		Unbelievable...
45		That's why you nearly threw your life away?
46		It's because I love you.
47		[ML:undisp ](shock)
48		If you're going to tell us to survive...
49		Well, then...
50		You should be following your own advice!
51		Jansen...
52		I'll bet...you probably only thought of me\nas a...little brother or a friend...
53		But I... I think I know you better than anyone.
54		Ohh!
55		Ohh!
56		Hold on, did he just...?
57		...Just what?
58		What now...?
59		Just be quiet.
60		Jansen...
61		Um.
62		I'm sorry.
63		You see, right now, I...
64		You don't have to say anything now.\nIt's just...I needed to get that across.
65		Instead, when the fighting's done...
66		...maybe we could talk this over\nwith each other some more?
67		I'm your superior officer.
68		Yeah, but when Moebius are gone,
69		ranks won't mean a thing.
70		Ugh!
71		Please...just think it over.
72		[ML:undisp ](adlib, stumbling)
73		Dude, nice one!
74		Were you scared?
75		Shut it!
76		Anyway. Shall we go?
77		It's gonna be tough getting that stuff out of the cave.
78		Ah, snuff it. I'll help you out.
79		Me too!
80		Time for big treasure hunt!

0	3	Wow. Never seen you\npull a face like that before!
1	D	What...kind of face, exactly?
2	3	Heh heh...
3	3	Like a Tirkin eating a Black Liver Bean...
4	D	Yeah, I can imagine...
5	D	I have certain duties to uphold as Elder.
6	D	I've got to head the army, win the future...
7	D	So...I just thought I could put off everything\nelse until the world to come.
8	3	Well, maybe this is a good opportunity.
9	3	Just talk to him. Tell him what kind of\na future you want in this "world to come".
10	3	Mother, Elder... Can't say I understand\nwhat those really mean.
11	3	"If you look to the future, you can become\nwhoever you wanna be."
12	3	In the wise words of a certain someone.
13	D	Hah, touché.
14	3	You should be who you wanna be too.
15	D	A life after war, eh...?
16	D	Maybe there is.
evt/tq/msg_tq011207t.json
0	vl1	Even without the power of Ouroboros,\nthere's still plenty we can do.
1	vl1	You just focus on taking down Moebius\nand forget about anything else.
2	vl1	I'm older now than my brother ever was...\nThat's a really strange feeling.
3	vl1	Maybe I'm even stronger now\nthan he was when he died.
evt/tq/msg_tq011208t.json
0	wl1	Garrett's always been a difficult\nsort of guy.
1	wl1	Jansen surprised me though,\ntalking back to a superior like that.
2	wl1	The way Garrett talked about his brother,\nthough... Can you blame him?
3	wl1	Hey, did you know that Jansen is\nMonica's little-brother-in-law?
4	wl1	Uh..."brother-in-law"... I guess that's\na tricky concept for you guys.

0	yl1	Yeah, nothing for it...\nI guess it's time for Plan B.
1	yl1	Ah... Uh... Nothing!\nMind your own business!
2	yl1	If I can't be an Ouroboros, I'll just\nuse my head and find some other way\nto help out the City.
3	yl1	I've always been the smart one.\nNo reason I shouldn't get out and\nmake something of myself.
evt/tq/msg_tq011211t.json
0	ll1	It's a bit of a dangerous job, sure,\nbut I know it's for the good of the City.
1	ll1	When I look at it like that, it really\nmotivates me. And hey, we're all\nin this together.
2	ll1	Wanting to help the people who're\nimportant to you... Yeah, I get that.

0	F	Ah, the scent of Saffronia...\nThis takes me back...
1	1	Takes you back...?\nYou mean, you know what this is?
2	F	Yes, of course!
3	F	Saffronia trees used to grow in the world\nthat I came from, you see.
4	6	Huh? For real?
5	2	So that's where Saffronia trees come\nfrom... Who'd have guessed?
6	F	That's not all... What you call the Urayan\nMountains came from my world, too.
7	3	Whoa... Seriously? I always thought\nthey were funny-shaped mountains...
8	F	I mean, now they're mountains...\nBack then, they weren't so picturesque.
9	6	Are there more places like this?\nStuff that we don't know the true\norigin of...?
10	F	Actually, yes! In fact, I daresay, pretty\nmuch everywhere you've seen till now.
11	5	Makes sense. If you hadn't been here,\nwe'd have just walked right past like it\nwas no big thing!
12	F	I suppose it's good for you all to know\nabout how things were in the old world.
13	F	Well now you've all got this new\nperspective, why not have a look back\nat the path you've already traced?
14	1	Looking back at where we came from...\nThat could be a really valuable experience.
15	F	Yes! Please, give it some thought.
16	F	The path that you're on now will lead you\nto the future that you've dreamed of.
evt/tq/msg_tq011401f.json
0	F	...
1	1	Nia...? Everything all right?
2	F	This place you call Maktha Wildwood...
3	F	Do you know anything about all the ruins\nand things scattered around here?
4	1	No, to tell the truth.
5	3	I never paid them any mind, I guess.\nBut now you mention 'em, they do\nseem pretty weird.
6	6	...Oh! Hey, is this also related to stuff from\nyour old world, Nia?
7	F	That's a good guess, Sena.\nNot quite right, but you aren't far off.
8	4	...Please, explain.
9	F	All right, I will. This is probably something\nyou ought to know about.
10	F	I told you before about\nAionios's creation, right?
11	F	Well, what I'm about to talk about goes\nback much further into the past than that.
12	2	You mean...when the worlds were one?
13	F	The people of that time had access to\nabsolute power, using it to create and\nenjoy a flourishing civilization.
14	F	But, in the end, they started to fight\neach other for control over that very\npower...
15	F	And because of that, the power became\na calamity and ripped the world in two.
16	F	What we're looking at now is the\nremnants of the destruction that\nhumanity has wrought...
17	F	So the true meaning of all this ruin...\nis to stand as a monument to the\nhistory that created this world.
18	4	If you really think about it, we human\nbeings are the cause of all of it...
19	3	I don't get it... Why fight\ntill everything burns?
20	F	The answer is...because they were afraid.
21	6	Afraid...of what?
22	F	Afraid of "ending"...
23	2	...
24	F	All life... All civilizations and cultures...\nEverything comes to an end, in time.
25	F	Of course, humans are part of the world,\ntoo. We can't escape that rule either.
26	F	But people never stop looking for a way,\neven if it means going beyond the rules.
27	F	"Eternity"... That's what\nthey were searching for.
28	2	Eternity...
29	F	If the present moment carries on\nforever, then the end will never come.\nThat's eternity.
30	F	With that, the miserable decay that you're\nlooking at now would never come to pass.
31	1	...
32	F	I think you probably all know\nthe rest of the story already.
33	F	Why this world that we're in now is called\n"Aionios"...the realm of eternity.
34	2	Z also wants eternity...\nJust as the people did back then.
35	1	But, I mean...even though they were\nlonging for eternity...
36	1	...to sacrifice so many lives to achieve it,\nit's not... It can't be right!
37	2	...I agree.
38	2	We might get hurt...and someday,\nwe'll be gone. But we have to keep\nmoving forward, in spite of all that.
39	2	That's what it means to live. Right, Nia?
40	F	...Yes. Exactly right. That must be clear to\nyou all now.
41	F	You should hold on to that vision of life,\ncherish it as you go forward.
42	F	Keep that in your heart so that you never\nrepeat the mistakes of the past.

3	F	Heh, it's fine. I may have taken\nmy teasing a step too far there.
4	2	Uhm... I hope what I'm about to say\ndoesn't come out the wrong way, but...
5	F	Yes?
6	2	It's just, you're our Queen! We believed\nyou were the one that gave us all life...\nAnd that we'd return to you in the end.
7	2	You were like this awesome being,\nhigh above... None of us could even\ndream of talking to you.
8	F	...
9	2	And now you're just traveling along with\nus and chatting like it's an everyday thing.
10	2	It's just really bizarre to me somehow.\nLike things have been switched around.\nIt still feels a little strange...
11	F	Could it be...that it just hasn't sunk in yet?
12	2	...
13	F	...I see.
14	F	Heheh... Well, it's the same for me.
15	2	Wh-what?
16	F	I'm sure I've told you this before, but\nplease indulge me.
17	F	While I was asleep in the Cloudkeep,\nI was getting information about what was\nhappening in the world.
18	F	So I knew, long before, that you were not\nM, but an independent being called "Mio".
19	F	But...it was nothing more than information.
20	F	I wanted to truly know you more than\nanyone else, but I couldn't touch you,\ncouldn't make contact.
21	F	I felt so close to you... But you were\nstill this distant far-off thing... It was\nso frustrating.
22	2	...!
23	F	But right now, you're so close I can reach\nout and touch you... Speak with you, even.
24	F	I never thought the day would come.\nIt's a truly strange feeling.
25	2	...It's the same for me.
26	F	Indeed. It's amazing really, the way things\nworked out, don't you think?
27	2	Hehe. For sure.
28	2	If I hadn't become Ouroboros,\nI'd never have had the chance to\nmeet you, Nia.
29	2	Sometimes a small pebble starts the\navalanche which changes your whole\nfuture, don't you think?
30	F	...No, I don't think you can\nput it all down to chance.
31	2	...Huh? What do you mean?
32	F	I think we met because we were supposed\nto, Mio. It was meant to be.
33	F	Because, to me, you're...
34	3	Hey!\nMio! Nia!
35	3	We're heading out soon, guys!\nGet a move on, or you'll get left behind!
36	2	OK! We're coming!
37	2	Shall we go join the others?
38	F	...Sure. Let's do that.
39	F	Mio!

2	Q	Uh? What's that? You got time on\nyour hands, have you?
3	Q	...Huh?
4	Q	Why, if it isn't...
5	F	I believe this is the first time we\nspeak directly, isn't it, Ghondor?
6	Q	Can someone tell me what\nthe hell's going on? What's the\nQueen of Agnus doin' here?
7	Q	...Oh, uh, hang on.
8	Q	I suppose we *are* in Agnus Castle right\nnow. So...maybe it's not so weird to see\nyou here...
9	Q	But, what I don't get is, why's the Queen\nof Agnus seem to know about me?
10	F	That's...\nWell, it's a long story.
11	F	The Vandham name, and those that\nbear it, have a deep meaning for me.
12	Q	You mean my family?
13	F	In the past, I...we...were saved by a man\ncalled Vandham. He taught us a lot about\nlife, and what it was we were called to do.
14	F	It's no exaggeration to say that,\nwithout him, there would be no me.
15	5	Huh? A real deep connection between\nNia and Ghondor's fam? Spooky.
16	F	The memories of it are all but lost now...\nThese were events of the distant past.
17	Q	Oho...
18	Q	...Uh, more to the point, seems you dags\nhave gotten pretty used to chumming up\nwith royalty. Like it's no big thing!
19	6	Well, Nia asked us to treat her that\nway. Like another one of the gang.
20	5	C'mon, Ghondor. Surely you more than\nanyone wouldn't expect us to mince our\nwords around Nia.
21	Q	Wind your neck in, will ya?\nNothin' wrong with how I talk!
22	F	Haha... Oh, you're so bold and\nunabashed. I simply adore it!
23	Q	Uh...oh...? I suppose I am...
24	F	I mean, you've passed through the\nconflict with the false Queen, maintained\norder in the Castle...
25	F	There are a lot of things that came\nabout because of your blood, sweat\nand tears, Ghondor.
26	Q	Huh? Well, that's a real heckuva\ncompliment... Too much for the\nlikes of me maybe, your Madge.
27	Q	All I reckon we really did was set a few\nboundaries to stop things going daft.
28	Q	I don't have a clue about your\nAgnian folks though.
29	F	You're just being humble, Ghondor.\nPlease, there's no need for it.
30	F	It's not easy to earn people's trust,\nto maintain the balance.
31	F	And you do all that, while still remaining\nnatural, unadulterated Ghondor.
32	Q	Oi! I'm basically an adult!\nI'm almost- Ah, forget it...
33	6	Ghondor... You really soften up when\nyou get a few kind words, don't you?
34	Q	Huh...! Who're you callin' soft...?!
35	F	I hope Agnus can count on\nyour continued support.
36	Q	I mean, what I'd really like to be\nsaying right now...is "bite me".
37	Q	But since I got a real-deal Queen going to\nall the trouble of asking me, I guess I've\ngotta at least consider the request a bit.
38	F	From the bottom of my heart,\nthank you, Ghondor.
39	F	As the nominal lady of Agnus Castle,\nI bestow upon you my sincere admiration\nfor fulfilling the-
40	Q	Hey! Whoa! Enough already...!\nIt's like you *wanna* make me squirm?!
41	6	Ah, there's our Ghondor...
42	Q	Just shut up, will you?!\nWe're done talking about me, all right?!
43	Q	You Ouroboros arseholes mind your own\nbeeswax, all right? I better not hear you've\nbeen holding the Queen back!
44	Q	You're a real goofy bunch, arentcha?\nJust bein' around ya counts as a hazard!
45	3	Pff... Pot calling the kettle black much,\nthere, Ghondor, love?
evt/tq/msg_tq011404s.json

1	1	Good question!
2	1	Nia! Anywhere you still want to go?
3	F	...
4	F	Well, if you're asking me to choose,\nthen I may have to ask your advice first.
5	2	Sure. I hope we can give you\na decent answer!
6	F	In all the places you guys have been\nso far...
7	F	...was there ever a place where\nyou could...look at the sky up\nclose? Almost touch it...
8	4	But...\nWhat do you mean, close to the sky...?
9	3	Uh, I guess she means, like,\nhave we ever been to the\nhighest place in the world, right?
10	6	The highest place...? Uhm...\nHave we? Maybe? Maybe not...
11	1	Is that where you'd like to go now, Nia?
12	F	Yes... I mean...I don't have any\nreally major reason for it, but...
13	F	Just...when you asked where\nI wanted to go, that was the first thing\nthat popped into my head.
14	2	What, the sky, you mean?
15	F	Maybe, when I look up at the sky, I just...
16	F	...long to go back there. A sort of nostalgia.
17	2	...
18	1	Well, if that's what you want, then why don't\nwe try and find a high place for you?
19	F	Oh! Really? You're good with that?
20	3	I'm cool with it. Anyway, it was me who\nbrought up this whole "where do you want\nto go" chat in the first place.
21	6	If there's a way-up-there, sky-scraping\nplace like that, I'd love to check it out\nmyself!
22	F	You guys...
23	F	Thank you so much. I guess I'm\ncounting on you all over again.
24	F	Let's find it together then! The place\nwhere we'll be close enough to touch\nthe sky!
25	F	Huh? You're asking me?
26	1	Right! If there's something you've been\nwanting to do or see, please let us know!
27	F	Oh, but I mean...\nWherever you're headed, it's fine by me...
28	6	C'mon, Nia! Speak your mind!
29	5	After all, we've been dragging you\nabout all over the shop. Time for you\nto choose our next move!
30	F	It's really kind of you all to say that!\nMuch appreciated.
31	F	But actually, what I said before, I really\nmeant it. Wherever you go, I will follow.
32	1	Uhm... Is that right?
33	F	Yes. That's right.
34	F	Traveling together with you, even if we're\nnot headed anywhere in particular, well,\nthat's more than enough fun for me!
35	3	Huh... OK, well, whatever! If that's\nwhat Nia wants, then so be it.
36	2	There's no need to decide on\na destination right now. Why don't we\nall just think it over for a while?
37	F	Yes! I'll give it some consideration, then.

10		N-Nia, what's gotten into you?
11		Why are you saying this now?
12		When this battle is over,

14		When the worlds were divided, they knew nothing of each other.
15		In the end, they'll be strangers once again...

34		You'll be building it together with us, Nia.
35		Y-you mean...?
36		I mean, even if we do get separated,\nsomeday we'll see each other again.
37		We want you with us, Nia, in that future.\nHow could we not? We need you.
38		Rather...please stay.
39		Because... The connection we share...
40		Nia...
41		That's something...that can never be broken.

43		Ah... I mean, if that's...the future that you want...
44		No... Let me try that again.
45		That future...
46		I'll share it with you!
47		It's not just yours... It's *our* future\nwe'll invest in.

5	Zf1	What a welcome sight, to see you return!
6	G	Has a problem arisen in my absence?

8	af1	Actually, we do have a bit of a problem\non our hands, Your Majesty.
9	Zf1	Hey! Mind your-
10	af1	We have to report the facts as they are.\nHow much longer are you going to leave\nthis hanging, eh?
11	Zf1	...Tch.
12	1	What's the problem?
13	af1	Couple of days ago, we had a small run-in\nwith our Agnian opposites.
14	af1	Aizel took care of them, but things\ngot out of hand a little bit...

21	G	The presence of a Flame Clock is not what\ninstigates a battle. The glimmerings of war\nare always there, within us.

26	Zf1	I am ashamed... Truly ashamed!
27	Zf1	Now that this has come to a head,\nI cannot but take full responsibility...
28	Zf1	I will thwart their objective,\neven if it should cost me my life!
29	G	You shall not!
30	G	Do not speak of throwing\nyour life away so lightly.
31	G	I've already lost so many of my friends.\nI could not bear to lose another...
32	Zf1	Your Majesty!
33	G	I told you, did I not?\nYou are my hope.
34	G	I will speak to the Agnian chief retainer\npersonally about the matter.
35	G	In the meantime, cool your head.
36	Zf1	...
37	G	Any more unfinished business that\nI should know about?
38	af1	Couple of house calls to make,\nYour Majesty. They want you at\nColony 9 and the City.
39	1	Colony 9? So Zeon, then?
40	Zf1	Indeed. They've asked for some urgent\nbackup following the recent Origin attack.
41	af1	And the other request is from Monica.\nWants you to give her people a pep talk.
42	G	The descendants of Ouroboros...
43	G	I've caused such grief for them,\nand for an unfathomably long time.
44	1	...But now they get to speak\nto their real Queen.
45	1	I'm sure they'll be overjoyed.
46	G	...Yes, perhaps.
47	G	Speaking face to face with another...\nThere's nothing quite like it.
48	1	Um, Melia...?
49	G	I'm sorry. I'm afraid I'm going to be\ntaking up some more of your time...
50	2	Now, you can cut that out.
51	2	Agnus or Keves, soldier or Queen...\nWhat difference does it make?
52	3	The future is to be created by each\nand every person in the world.
53	3	I think you were the one\nwho taught us that.
54	G	...True enough.
55	G	Your unyielding spirit...gives me\nthe strength to go on.
56	1	Sometimes when Melia smiles...\nI see sadness in her eyes.
57	1	As if she's all alone in the world...
58	5	Well, better start making the rounds.\nWe've gotta stop by Colony 9, the City,\nand...
59	6	Agnus Castle, right?
60	Zf1	Safe journey to you all.

2	G	I trust it's been...quiet in my absence?
3	Zf1	Yes.
4	G	I see that you have calmed down.
5	Zf1	Yes, I have realized.\nHowever fervent my loyalty,
6	Zf1	If I am ever the source of\nHer Highness's anguish, it does no good.
7	G	You think too deeply, Aizel.\n'Tis your mind's fiction.
8	Zf1	Ah... I will rectify that!
9	G	[ML:undisp ](light chuckle)
10	G	I am sure you will.
11		How was your trip?\nAnd what of the world?
12	G	Mankind's follies... People never learn.
13	G	Whatever the passage of fate may bring,
14	G	we must never lose the spirit of defiance.
15	G	Lest we submit to injustice.
16	G	As we once did...
17	1	Again... Why does she look so sad...?
18	G	My friends and I, we... We fought hard for all this.
19	G	We staked our lives on this future.
20	G	And if there's a chance to keep it that way...
21	G	I too will be happy...to sacrifice myself for this world.
22	3	Snuff that for a laugh.
23	3	I hate that. You're the important one here.
24	G	Pardon?
25	1	It's true. It's something I noticed before.
26	1	As befits a Queen, you're always\nthinking about your subjects.
27	1	But, who thinks about what's best for you?
28	2	Seeing you suffer alone like this... None of us like it.
29	2	It's too sad to think about. Losing you, that is.\nYou're one of us.
30	3	Yeah, think about how much you always think of us.
31	3	It's only fair...if you let us do the same for you.
32	G	I am speechless...
33	1	Melia, you *are* needed in this world.
34	1	But, you weren't born solely for the world's sake.
35	G	That may be so...
36	G	However, I...
37	1	If you'd permit me,\nI'll gladly lend you my strength.
38	1	Not because you are our Queen...
39	1	But because we're travelers,\nin the here and now.
40	1	So we should live. Together.
41		(I'm glad you're with us, Melia!)
42		(Fighting alongside you all is the best!)
43	G	Yes... You are right.
44	G	How funny.
45	G	Though wisdom is said to come with age...
46	G	still you all seem to teach me so much.
47	G	If some things elude my grasp,
48	G	your words...show me that there is more.\nMore to life.
49	G	They guide me when I run astray.\nAgain...
50	G	and again...
51	G	How fortunate I am...to have you.
52	3	Haha! Now that's more like it, girl.
53	1	Melia... Thank you.
54	1	Thank you...for always having believed in us.
55	G	That's one thing I would never doubt.
56	G	Now we embark on our quests.
57	G	To create...the future.
58	1	Yes... It's ours!

12	uX1	Hey... Hey, look.\nIsn't that the Queen?
13	vX1	What? Like, the real deal?
14	I	Right... Back to my post.
15	I	Excuse me.
16	I	Origin's attack unfortunately caused a\nlandslide near Alfeto Valley entrance.
17	I	We've been treating the wounded, and also\ndispatched a survey team to scan the area.
18	I	The thing is, we've lost contact with the\nsurvey team. The line just went dead...
19	mX1	There was a really loud sound earlier on!\nCould be more rocks!
20	G	I see. Then we'll take it from here.
21	G	Eunie, how are you doing over there?
22	3	I've healed up the worst of 'em.\nNow they just need a little R&R.
23	wX1	Aw, really? I've gotta lie down?
24	3	C'mon. If you've got the energy to\nflap yer trap already, you'll be back\non your feet in no time.
25	G	I see I had no cause to worry.
26	1	How many were on the survey team?
27	I	Three. One was piloting the Levnis.
28	I	...OK, I've sent the landslide's\nlocation to your Iris. You can\nconfirm it for yourself.
29	1	Got it.
30	mX1	Uh, if you happen to see an Anita\nfrom the survey team...could you, er...
31	mX1	T-tell her to give back what she owes!
32	mX1	'Cause I'll be waiting here until she does!
33	G	...I'll be sure to deliver the message.
34	G	I am so sorry to have let this come to\npass, everyone. This ordeal will be over,\nere long.

0	nX1	Hello...?\nWho's...there...?
1	G	It's all right. We're here to help.
2	G	Stay still. I'll get that heavy thing\noff you right this instant!
3	3	Right, that's her injuries about treated!
4	G	You're a survivor by nature.\nGood fortune that we made it in time.
5	nX1	Oh, I can't thank you enough!\nI thought I was a goner...
6	3	Say, you wouldn't happen\nto be Anita, by any chance?
7	nX1	Yeah, I'm Anita.
8	6	Oh, that's great news! There was a guy\nin the rescue tent who was really worried\nabout you!
9	6	He said he wanted you to pay him back,\nor something?
10	G	I suspect that was merely an excuse.
11	G	He seemed really rather worried.\nVery insistent that you make it back.
12	nX1	Ah, it's got to be Kurt. We've been in the\nsame unit since first term.
13	nX1	He can be a little faint-hearted at times.\nI'd better go and try to calm him down...
14	G	Ah... So you've been joined at the hip\nsince childhood.
15	nX1	Joined at the... Sorry?
16	G	I mean that you were...inseparable.\nYou've had a special connection\nthroughout your lives.
17	G	You understand each other's feelings,\nand you lift each other up in times of\nneed, is what I'm trying to say.
18	1	...Hm?
19	G	Your friends are irreplaceable.\nBe sure to treasure them.
20	nX1	Yes, ma'am! Thank you, thank you!
21	1	Did she have someone in mind herself?\nThere's someone out there special to her?
22	1	But then, she was imprisoned\nin Origin for so long...

4	6	Aw, yeah!\nWe'll clear this out in no time!
5	G	You're in safe hands now.
6	xX1	Y-yes, thank you!

evt/tq/msg_tq011515f.json

1	sX1	There was a...second landslide...\nDon't mind me... Look for the others...
2	G	We're well aware. But firstly...
3	sX1	Ah! Feels warm...
4	G	Do not move from this spot.\nWe're going to check the immediate area.
5	sX1	A-ah, yes... Of course!
evt/tq/msg_tq011516f.json
0	3	Right. I think that's the lot of 'em\naccounted for!
1	4	I wouldn't relax just yet.
2	4	The landslides have formed a sharp\nincline, in turn increasing the risk of\nloose rocks.
3	4	I hardly need to state this,\nbut the possibility of further\nlandslides remains high.
4	G	Getting caught in another landslide\nwould be undesirable.
5	G	We must make some distance, and quickly.\nBack to Colony 9.
evt/tq/msg_tq011517f.json
0	vX1	The Queen has returned!
1	uX1	Welcome back!\nWe're glad to see you safe, Your Majesty.
2	G	We were at the site of the landslide,\nbut the situation remains precarious.
3	G	It is vital that we remove the remaining\nrocks upon the slope in the coming days.\nYou shall have the Castle's aid, of course...
4	G	But your own assistance in this matter\nwould also be most appreciated.
5	uX1	Oh, we'd be glad to help!\nNever want to have to go\nthrough this again...
6	nX1	But if we hadn't, we'd never have got\nto meet Queen Melia...
7	nX1	I don't regret it. Because I learned\ntoday that we weren't forsaken...
8	G	Forsaken?
9	vX1	The only time we normally ever get to\nmeet Your Majesty is at the Homecoming.
10	vX1	We've been through so many bitter times,\nbut we've never known you to help us.\nNot so directly.
11	G	...You make a valid point.
12	G	From this moment on, I will endeavor to\nthe best of my ability to allay your fears.
13	mX1	Ah! You're too kind, Your Majesty!
14	I	Then, in the interest of allaying fears,\nthere may be another matter I would like\nto discuss with you...
15	G	Oh, yes? Speak up, then.
16	I	I would like, from this moment on, to let\nthe colony elect their commander, of their\nown volition.
17	I	And I don't mean just for appointing\na successor after death or for the purposes\nof reform.
18	I	If they make their voices known,\nthen I think I would gladly relinquish my\nposition as commander this second.
19	nX1	What?!
20	mX1	What brought this on...?
21	G	Then...you wish to formally step down?
22	I	Well... I was always the Consul's\nfavorite plaything.
23	I	I was a mere pawn dancing to his whims,\nenacting his orders...
24	I	But in coming to terms with our new life,\nI began to realize the qualities needed in\na commander are very different nowadays.
25	1	Please don't belittle yourself, Zeon.
26	1	You've worked so hard to get where\nyou are.
27	I	Believe me, I've thought about this\nlong and hard. About who really fits the\nrole of a commander.
28	I	It must be someone we all look up\nto. Someone with whom we can\nshare our path.
29	1	Zeon...
30	G	While I do not object to your logic,\nZeon, I hope you realize that our role\nis in essence naught but a figurehead.
31	G	What that figurehead represents, however,\nis something only you can decide.
32	I	It's down to me...?
33	G	A person is not shaped solely by their\nbirthright or innate qualities.
34	G	As long as you remain critical of who you\nare, whether you deserve the position or\nnot has little relevance.
35	I	This crisis of conscience...\nYou once experienced it as well,\nYour Majesty?
36	G	Of course. Everyone has their battles\nwith self-doubt. How else does one grow\nas a person?
37	G	...If you remain true to yourself,\nthen you have nothing to fear.
38	G	In this rich tapestry of life, you must find\nthe path that you are willing to weave.
39	I	...I will give it more thought, then.
40	G	Very good. I look forward to hearing\nyour answer.
41	1	Melia must have had her share of hardship,\nto talk about these things in such depth...
42	1	If she's ever stuck in a rut, I wonder\nif we'll be able to console her in the\nsame way?
43	1	Would she even want that...?
44	G	Penny for your thoughts, Noah?
45	1	...No, it's nothing.
46	1	We should get going.\nWe've got some traveling ahead of us.

1	ro1	Don't worry, I know the whole story.
2	ro1	...Oh, bloody hell-
3	ro1	Ahem. I see you are in good company.
4	G	They're kindly serving as my bodyguard.
5	G	They're assisting me with a number of\nother matters, too.
6	2	The assistance goes both ways, actually.
7	9	We all one big happy family!
8	G	...Yes, that's right. Family.
9	ro1	...Indubitably.
10	ro1	I have a rough grasp of our\npresent predicament.
11	ro1	You've come to hear *their* side\nof the story, have you not?
12	4	You make it sound as if these are\nno ordinary Agnians.
13	ro1	With Queen Melia's assistance, we\nhave been closely monitoring them\non both sides.
14	ro1	I'll get to the point: these people belong\nneither to Keves nor Agnus.
15	G	To be precise, they were formerly\nAgnian soldiers, but...
16	G	Now they claim to have lost their\nfaith even in Agnus.
17	G	This intense distrust of the future has\ndriven them to wanton destruction.
18	2	So they stopped believing in anything,\nand now they just want to ruin things\nfor everyone?
19	6	That's awful...
20	ro1	The Keves and Agnus of today are\nfounded upon mutual trust and respect.\nAt least, that is the mood we try to foster...
21	ro1	But the reality is that not all of us can\nreadily accept these changes.
22	G	The recent outburst was just an\nact of passion, but if like-minded\npeople were to congregate...
23	4	They may gain enough momentum to\npose a legitimate threat, is that it?
24	4	So they're the ones who have incited\nthe latest uproar, I take it?
25	1	We might have to prepare for the\nworst-case scenario...
26	9	Manana bite.\nWhat make worst case so bad?
27	3	He means, there could be an attack\non the Queen's life.
28	9	Meh-meh?!\nThat worse than worst case!
29	G	That's one of the reasons, but we simply\ncan't afford to leave this be.
30	G	I don't believe they truly want\nto oppose us. Rather, they feel\nthey are at an impasse.
31	G	One cannot so easily change their way of\nlife, or how they view the world.
32	ro1	Perhaps I ought to assert my authority\nas Queen after all, and-
33	G	No, if you lock horns with them now,\nit's very possible they will shut you\nout completely.
34	G	I would rather have you prepare to\nwelcome them in with open arms.
35	ro1	That's incredibly kind of you...
36	3	So?\nWhere do we find these troublemakers?
37	ro1	It seems they're lying low at\nHovering Reef 6.
38	3	Seriously? That's right next to the Castle!
39	4	Presumably they approached under the\nguise of their fellow Agnian soldiers.
40	4	The Castle isn't on particularly high alert,\nso it makes sense that they wouldn't\narouse too much suspicion.
41	ro1	Yes, as sad as it is...
42	ro1	I hear they're pooling their forces.\nYou'd best be on your guard.
43	G	Fear not. I am no stranger to battle.
44	G	And besides, look at my entourage.
45	ro1	You shouldn't have to get used to this.
46	ro1	Experience can make a person stronger,\nit's true, but it can't take away one's pain.
47	ro1	That goes for Queens, too, you know.
48	2	The mood's turned dark all of a sudden...
49	G	I'm aware of that.\nThank you, Nia.
50	ro1	Take care, you guys...

1	3	They've hauled those things out here?\nCan't catch a break, can we?
2	G	As Lady Nia informed us, we should\nexpect them to be hiding in an ambush\nsomewhere on this island.
3	G	I must remind you that we are only here\nto negotiate. If possible, I would like to\navoid combat...
4	5	Sure, but what if they're the ones\nto come at us first?
5	G	Then suppress them at once. We could\neven disable their Levnises, so that they\nhave nothing with which to fight back.
6	5	Hey, I've been meaning to ask for\na while now... You really know how\nto handle yourself in a scrap, don't you?
7	G	Yes, I'm no stranger to the field of battle.\nNor is this the first attempt on my life.
8	6	Whuh? Even though you're the Queen?
9	G	Precisely because I am the Queen.
10	G	Is it really so strange for nobles to be\nacquainted with violence? There was\neven an assassin within my family once.
11	6	Huh?!
12	6	I'm sorry, I hope we didn't bring back\npainful memories for you...
13	G	Please, it's perfectly fine.\nMany are the things that have shaped me\ninto who I am today.
14	G	Learning to accept my weaknesses,\nunderstanding each other's differences...
15	G	Opening one's heart to others...
16	5	(whistle) You must've been in some real\ngood company to learn all that.
17	G	Haha! Perhaps, yes.
18	G	Back when I was young and naive,\nmy companions taught me some\ninvaluable lessons.
19	2	And you took those lessons to heart.
20	2	That's how you came to be such a\nmagnificent Queen.
21	G	Though times may change,\ntheir teachings will never fade.

15	5	Mate, have you been making that\nspeech to the Kevesi officers too?
16	5	Telling everyone that Melia's\ndifferent to everyone else?
17	nf1	You bet I did. She's so far up herself,\nit makes me sick.
18	5	If anyone's warped...distorted here...\nit's you.
19	nf1	Then what am I supposed to do?!\nWho else am I supposed to take\nmy rage out on?!
20	nf1	Tell me the truth. Right now.\nThe pure, unadulterated truth!!!
21	G	That, I cannot tell you.\nThe answer lies in you, and you alone.
22	G	You must have realized by now. There is\nno weight to the "truth" of another if you\ncannot judge it for yourself.
23	nf1	(gasp)
24	G	If you must have an object of hatred in\norder to live your life, then let it be me.
25	G	But promise me that someday, you'll live\nfor the things that truly have worth.
26	G	Just as you and your\ncomrades-in-arms once did...
27	nf1	It's already too late... I can't go back.\nNot after what I've done...
28	G	...I highly doubt that.
29	G	You are still breathing, are you not?
30	1	Are you all right?
31	G	I told you, I am no stranger to battle.
32	G	Besides, I could not tolerate simply\nwatching from the sidelines...
33	1	Melia...
34	G	Their sadness, frustration, anger...\nI shall never forget these feelings.
35	G	Come. Let us proceed to the next location.

1	F	I hear they're pooling their forces.\nYou'd best be on your guard.
evt/tq/msg_tq011531f.json
0	D	Your Majesty...?!
1	G	Sorry to bother you - I'm sure you're\nrushed enough as it is. I'm here to discuss\nthe speech you mentioned...
2	G	Did I come at a bad time?
3	D	No, not at all!
4	D	We've been stretching our necks every day\nwaiting to see if you'd turn up.
5	G	I too have been...anxious to meet you.
6	G	I'm sorry, to have been a source\nof anguish for you this long.
7	D	...It's all been for today.
8	D	I don't consider any of it a waste.
9	D	...Now, onto the matter at hand:\nrallying the troops.
10	D	With the final battle with Moebius looming\nbefore us, we're doing our best to prepare,\nbut we need more than just supplies.
11	D	A battle to determine the fate of the world\nis hardly a light topic. Everyone's beside\nthemselves with worry...
12	D	Some poor souls have completely snapped.\nWe're never going to last in actual combat\nat this rate.
13	G	I don't blame them...
14	G	No matter how noble our cause,\nthe fighting *will* cost us lives.
15	G	We're caught between the future we\ndesire, and the present, which is ours to\nlose. It's a place beset on all sides by fear.
16	3	You got that right.
17	3	Especially when there's no guarantee\nyou're gonna be coming home.
18	D	Even a brief address would do.\nJust as long as you speak to\nthem somehow.
19	G	I understand.
20	G	I don't know if I'll be able to get through\nto them, but I will try.
21	1	We'll be your guides while in the City,\nmake sure you don't lose your bearings.
22	G	That would be most appreciated.
23	G	While we're here, would it bother you if\nI took a look around the City itself?
24	D	Please, be my guest.\nI think we'd all like that.
25	1	Maybe we could take her to\nCentrilo Parade. There's plenty\nof people around there.
26	D	No objections from me. But...
27	D	There are some rather...shall we say,\nardent followers of the Queen up that way.
28	D	If they get too insistent, you might\nneed to give them a friendly nudge.
29	1	Oh yeah? All right, we'll keep a lookout.
evt/tq/msg_tq011532f.json
0	G	Now this is a far cry from the\ncolonies and the Castles.
1	G	Here is a place where people can\ntruly live...make a home.
2	3	I couldn't believe my eyes when\nI first saw this place.
3	3	All these different people I'd never seen\nbefore. Things of all shapes and sizes...
4	G	I wish I had been there to see\nyour reaction. A shame.
5	3	And see my mouth hanging open\nlike a lummox? Not worth it!
6	1	You seem to take it all in your stride.\nNone of this surprises you?
7	G	It's more that I am assailed by\nold memories.
8	G	Technologies of old are put into practice\nhere. I feel the industry of those times.
9	G	...Ah?!
10	km1	Is that...really you?\nQueen Melia?
11	G	Er, yes? I do go by that name...
12	km1	I knew it!
13	km1	I knew it from the moment I laid eyes\non you. You were something special!
14	vl1	Huff... Finally caught up...
15	xl1	Hey old man, you're gonna give\nyourself a heart attack.
16	km1	Thanks for your concern, but I'll decide\nwhen and how I'm going to pop my clogs!
17	km1	I've lived my whole life for this day...
18	km1	Heck, you all have, haven't you?!
19	lm1	Of course we have!
20	jm1	You've returned to us at last, my Queen!\nYou really are as radiant as they say...
21	pl1	Hey, fancy a bite? You should come by\nmy restaurant, sample a few of the local\ndishes!
22	mm1	Nobody wants to see your seedy little\nbistro! She wants something memorable!
23	pl1	Oh! Say that again, I dare you! If you hate\nmy establishment so much, I'll be more than\nhappy to bar you from it, permanently!
24	ll1	All right people, don't shove!\nAnd stop arguing!
25	ll1	We don't wanna scare the Queen now.
26	gm1	OH.
27	hm1	MY.
28	im1	DAYS.
29	gm1	KRYTO!!!
30	4	Come on now, this is getting excessive...
31	wl1	Ah, leave 'em.\nEveryone's been living for this moment.
32	yl1	It's always been my dream to see the\ntrue Queen come back to us...
33	yl1	A lot of us die before we get the chance.
34	ll1	...Yeah, but now it's actually happening!\nBefore our very eyes!
35	ll1	How can we possibly keep calm\nwhen a miracle is unfolding?
36	G	I'm so grateful to you all, my people.\nI would like to express a few words of\ngratitude, if I may.
37	G	It is a joy to see real human activity\nonce again, after all these years. I see\nthat you continue to remain strong.
38	pl1	'Course we do!\nGotta protect what we love, right?
39	km1	That's right. I'm not resting these old\nbones so long as there's life in 'em!
40	xl1	We'll hold out for decades more\nif we have to!
41	lm1	We have our Queen, and even\nOuroboros stand by her side!
42	vl1	With their strength behind us,\nMoebius won't stand a chance!
43	1	Looks like that takes care of that.
44	G	Indeed.
45	3	Wow... "Decades" plural...
46	3	And here we are, happy enough\nif we can reach one.
47	mm1	The way I see it, you lot are\nfar more incredible. You've achieved\nso much in so little time.
48	3	Huh? That's only natural, ain't it?\nGotta get stuff done in the time you have.
49	3	No way I could imagine having\nto fight for 40 or 50 years...
50	3	Feels so snuffin' far away...
51	G	Eunie...
52	nm1	By the by... I'm not seeing the\nStoryspinner anywhere.
53	G	Storyspinner?
54	yl1	He's this old guy who knows more about\nthe City's history than anyone. He's like a\nwalking encyclopedia!
55	wl1	Real curious bloke.\nNormally he'd jump at\nan opportunity like this...
56	nm1	He's no spring Tirkin, though. If he hears\nhe's missed his chance to meet Her Majesty,\nhe might drop dead from the shock...
57	G	Heavens...
58	G	Where might we find this person?\nI think we should pay him a visit.
59	3	What, really?
60	nm1	I'll bet it'd make his day,\nbut are you sure?
61	G	I would like to try to meet him,\nif at all possible.
62	1	...As you wish.\nIt's your call.
63	wl1	You'll probably find him at Mitia Lookout.
64	wl1	I hear it's one of his favorite spots.
evt/tq/msg_tq011533f.json
0	em1	Oi! What's all the fuss?
1	em1	Whose funeral is it this time?
2	G	Nobody's, I should hope.\nWe were just wondering if-
3	em1	Hgwah?!!!\nOld Melly?!
4	em1	Oh... This...this can't be real...\nSomebody pinch me!
5	em1	What if...it's actually my funeral?\nThen that would mean...
6	em1	Wh-where the blazes have I ended up?!
7	3	Yeah, uh, this is Mitia Lookout?\nIn the City?
8	G	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
9	G	I'm told you have quite the wisdom.\nI was hoping to ask you a few things,\nif it doesn't bother you.
10	em1	Ahh, I get ya.
11	em1	The Queen herself is asking me\npersonally to tell her a story!\nHuh, now I know I'm dreaming...
12	em1	Hey, Ouroboros kids! Gimme a good\nwallop. Here, right on the kisser!
13	5	Sure thing.
14	G	Have you gone quite mad?!
15	4	Lanz...
16	5	I-I didn't throw my weight into it!
17	2	Let's all calm down for a second\nand just talk sensibly. Please.
18	em1	Ahh, I see.\nA rousing speech for the City, eh?
19	em1	What a stroke of luck!\nEven after that battering, I'll know\nI'll be content in the afterlife!
20	5	Oh, don't start!\nYou were the one who asked us to!
21	em1	Well, it seems life's worth living a little\nwhile longer. Don't want to disappoint\nold Queenie now, do I?
22	em1	Go on, then. Ask away.
23		Has it been tough fighting on for decades?
24	G	I hear you have accumulated a wealth\nof knowledge over the years. If you don't\nmind my asking...
25	G	Is it not painful to know so much more\nthan people around you, and be so much\nolder?
26	em1	Why Melly, do you mean to say...
27	em1	you're worried about my ailments?!
28	G	...Pardon?
29	em1	I've got arthritis, dermatitis, constipation...\nBones are as brittle as all hell, and I can\nnever get a wink of sleep!
30	em1	When I do sleep in, the doc's gotta come\nand check my breathing... Can't do what I\nused to. If it's not one thing, it's another!
31	3	Yeah, that's not what she was\ntalking about.
32	em1	Oh, aye? What was it, then?
33		What do you know of Melia?
34	6	I've been wondering...
35	6	When you first saw Melia, I kinda got the\nimpression you knew more about her than\nyou let on...?
36	em1	'Course I do! Have you seen the stacks\nof literature they've got here in the City?\nPacked to the rafters!
37	em1	There's passages on the true Queen, too.\nAnd you betcha these eyes have read 'em\nall back to front, twenty times over!
38	6	So you know all about her?
39	em1	Naturally, naturally!\nHere, I'll give you an example...
40	em1	It is a lesser-known fact that Her Majesty\nis squeamish around shiny bugs!
41	G	Wha... How can you possibly know that?!
42	em1	There was also a little morsel about\nhow she found Rainbow Bugs particularly\nrevolting.
43	em1	They're extinct now, but I reckon they're\nbeasties about the size of your fist, whose\nbodily excretions make 'em glow, and-
44	G	All right, enough! You don't need to go\ninto such detail! The mere memory gives\nme goosebumps...
45	em1	Oh don't you worry, I've got plenty more\ntidbits like that up my sleeve!
46	3	We don't wanna hear it!\nLook, I'll tell you what I want to know.
47	em1	Oh yeah? I'm all ears.
48	3	When you get to the age you are,\nafter living for so many decades...
49	3	you must've had to say goodbye to so\nmany of your friends, and stuff. Must be\na lot of crap to deal with.
50	3	So uh... How do you cope?
51	em1	Ha ha ha, the pits is what it is!\nThere are times when I wonder\nwhy I don't just curl up and die!
52	em1	But see... Life ain't all sunshine and roses.\nI think that's part and parcel of it.
53	3	So what, you just have to go on living\nin misery? You've gotta be joking...
54	4	Eunie, are you all right?
55	3	I just wanna know what it's all about.\nGrowing old.
56	3	There's folk out there who get to live\nso much longer than us. And they still\nchoose to fight.
57	3	It just feels like I'm always taking a back\nseat. Like I'm getting left behind...
58	3	But I wanna be there with you guys.\nEven if it's just in spirit...
59	1	Eunie... I had no idea that was\nhow you felt.
60	3	Yeah, sorry...\nHard to put it into words, really.
61	G	Even if those you once loved are\nno longer a part of this world...
62	G	Lonely as it is, and painful though the\nmemories be, it is not wholly a tragic tale.
63	G	For you can keep close to your heart your\nmemories of those dear to you.
64	G	And that is something to take pride in.\nThat is what will give you strength.
65	G	Admittedly, my life took a very different\npath to the likes of my companions here...
66	G	But such are my thoughts.
67	em1	Ahh...!\nNever a truer word was spoken...
68	em1	That's one for the ages!\nWhere's my notepad?
69	2	The fact that you're worrying\nabout us, here and now, Eunie...
70	2	I don't think we'll ever forget that.\nYour feelings will transcend time...
71	1	I'd have to agree.
72	1	So don't feel like you need to be doing\nanything special for us, Eunie.
73	1	It's reassuring enough just being\nthe way you are.
74	3	Hah... Don't suppose you've\ngot any tissues on you?
75	3	Spark... Why'd you have to go\nand make it all soppy?
76	G	Nobody is leaving you behind, Eunie.
77	G	If you ever feel distance between you,\nyou need only speak out.
78	3	Wait... Was this all just to tell me that...?
79	em1	That's about the size of it.\nGood luck out there, young'uns.
80	5	Don't just pass it off as your own speech!
81	em1	Say, Melly...\nWould you mind if we shook hands?
82	5	He's straight-up ignoring me!
83	G	I don't see why not...?
84	em1	Oh, you angel! Now I can shuffle off\nthis mortal coil without regrets!
85	4	...
86	3	Knowledgeable my arse...
87	em1	Life's a cruel journey from one end to the\nother. You only get one chance to walk it.
88	em1	But if there's one thing that gives\nit all meaning, it's love.
89	2	That's very sweet...
90	em1	That ain't something I have to teach\nyou young folk, though. Your friends\nare lucky fellows.
91	3	Monica said something like\nthat, too. Still doesn't make\nmuch sense to me, though...
92	em1	Ho ho ho... Well, love takes many forms.\nThere are as many ways to show it as\nthere are people.
93	3	I'll remember that.\n...Thanks.
94	G	I hate to be the bearer of bad news,\nbut we should probably be getting on.
95	G	Till we meet again, Storyspinner.
96	em1	Indeed, indeed.\nSafe travels to you, Your Majesty.
97		What will you ask?

1	pa1	Was standing one minute and\nthen flop onto ground!
2	H	What?!
3	ha1	You're overreacting, don't you think?\nI'm just exhausted, that's all.
4	2	You've been pushing yourself too hard?
5	ha1	Workload's pretty intense right now.
6	ha1	I've got to do my part to keep\nthe colony running.
7	6	Is it really that bad...?
8	ha1	We used to get support based on how well\nthe Levnis squadrons performed in battle.
9	ha1	The Castle provided for us, so now\nwe have to work like a mudder to\nmake up the shortfall.
10	H	Why didn't you tell me?
11	ha1	Didn't think I needed to. I thought I could\nmanage well enough by myself.
12	pa1	Now that stink of untruth.
13	pa1	Yuzet working hard for Valdi.\nDid not want sympathy vote.
14	ha1	Hey!
15	pa1	Yuzet want to act dependable to get on\ngood side of Valdi. Tried hard not to show\nweakness.
16	H	Is that true?
17	ha1	...What does it matter? Fact is,\nI can't be lying down on the job.
18	5	Look, we get that you're under\na lot of pressure. What is it that\nneeds doing anyhow?
19	pa1	Dispatching of Levnises to Colony Lambda.
20	4	To Lambda?
21	6	So you're lending out Kevesi Levnises\nto Agnus?
22	ha1	That's right. Even after they've served their\npurpose in battle, the Levnises themselves\ncan still function.
23	ha1	I wanted to get as much use\nout of them as I could.
24	pa1	So he say, but now look\nat sorry state of him!
25	pa1	Repapa also been showing Yuzet\nropes as little side project.
26	ha1	Oh, you were teaching me?
27	H	Let me help! I'd love to!
28	H	Come on, give me a job to do!
29	ha1	Huh?
30	ha1	Uhh, well, if you're asking...
31	ha1	How about handling the Levnis shipment\nI was talking about?
32	ha1	Once you get them there, it's just a matter\nof delivering them to the commander.
33	H	Sure thing. I can do that!
34	4	Incidentally...
35	4	What need does Commander Isurd have\nwith Kevesi Levnises?
36	ha1	I'm not a hundred percent on the\ndetails, but he wants them for some\nkind of survey.
37	1	Levnises to scout something out?\nI wonder what's going on at Lambda...
38	5	No point speculating when we can just\ncheck it out ourselves.
39	5	Right?
40	H	Right!
41	ha1	Be thorough, yeah?\nOh, but uh...don't push it too hard.
42	H	Ah, we'll be fine. You just take a lie-down\nand make sure you're all rested up.
43	H	So then. Off to Colony Lambda we go!
evt/tq/msg_tq011601f.json
0	H	Commander Isurd, right?
1	H	We're here with the Levnises you ordered!
2	A	I appreciate how readily you accepted\nour request. Thank you.
3	A	But I must say, I hadn't expected you to\ndeliver them in person, Commander.
4	H	Yeah, sorry about that.\nWe had to improvise.
5	H	Ah, you know how to operate them, right?\nOur guys normally do the piloting.
6	A	We've hired pilots for that very reason.\nThough we wouldn't mind getting some\npointers...
7	H	Oh, that's great! Our pilots have been\nwanting to chat with you too!
8	H	Anything you need to know, just ask.
9	A	Glad to hear it.
10	4	Commander Isurd.
11	4	I hear you're using the Levnises for some\nsort of survey. Care to divulge?
12	A	Yes, about that...
13	A	We've observed recently that\nour water sources around the colony\nare being rapidly depleted.
14	1	So you're using them to investigate?
15	A	No, in fact the survey branch has already\nidentified the cause.
16	A	It's the Ansels living at the top\nof the great falls.
17	4	Ansels? But their natural habitat should be\nthe Urayan Mountains...
18	A	Indeed. And their presence here\nhas been affecting the flora.
19	A	We're particularly concerned about their\nlaying waste to the Curegrass we use to\ntreat our troops.
20	4	That's an issue all right.
21	5	So you want to take those overgrown\nfeatherbrains out of the picture, that it?
22	2	Which is why you need powerful Levnises.
23	3	You're lookin' a bit worse for wear\nthere, Izzy. You been running yourself\nragged too?
24	A	Too?
25	H	My lieutenant's also been burning\nhimself out.
26	A	Oh...
27	4	Noah.
28	1	We'll help you out too.
29	A	I appreciate the offer, but I think-
30	H	You underestimate this job and you're\ngoing to collapse from overexertion too.
31	H	Better to share the load, no?\nIt'll make life easier.
32	6	Valdi's really worried about him...
33	5	Could be a nice little excursion.\nNo one's gonna complain.
34	A	All right then. If it's no trouble.
35	A	We'll have this issue sorted in no time flat\nwith you on board.
36	H	Easy-peasy! Just let us at 'em!
37	A	I look forward to this,\nCommander Valdi.

1	H	They won't be tearing up the Curegrass any longer!
2	H	I hope that now...
3	H	their fighting days are finally over.
4	9	Valdi, please to look.
5	9	Such pretty-pretty flowers!
6	H	Oh, wow.
7	H	But...it's such a tiny patch of them.
8	4	[ML:undisp ](gasp)
9	3	You think those Ansels got 'em\nor something?
10	4	No, those flowers are from the Urayan Mountains!
11	4	And they don't normally grow in this region...
12	H	Well...how, then?
13	1	Maybe it's just as Eunie said.
14	1	Maybe...the Ansels carried the seeds\nand they ended up here.
15	3	That's nuts.
16	2	They probably had the seeds stuck in their\nfeathers...and they just happened to land here.
17	3	Still, of all the places they could have bloomed...
18	5	It's just random chance, Eunie.\nNot like they grew here on purpose.
19	5	Only question's whether they make it.
20	H	Huh?
21	H	They did choose...
22	H	They chose to bloom up here.
23	H	They never gave up.
24	H	They're just like me.
25	H	This world...
26	H	It lives and breathes...just like me.
27	9	Happy revelation?
28	H	Yeah. It's awesome!
evt/tq/msg_tq011603f.json
0	A	I see it went well.\nWe've already received your report.
1	4	About the Ansels' impact\non the environment...
2	A	It's all good. Our survey branch will be\nmonitoring the situation carefully.
3	H	Then how about we leave the\nLevnises here?
4	H	Could you give us an update if you happen\nto find out anything new?
5	5	You feeling OK there, Valdi? You sound\nlike you're interested in something that's\nnot a Levnis.
6	H	Aw, come on. They're adapting to their\nenvironment by themselves!
7	H	It's such an amazing phenomenon -\nhow could I possibly pass it up?
8	A	Hah. How indeed.
9	A	The most feared mechanic in Keves,\nso wide-eyed and innocent.
10	H	Huh?
11	A	Up until we met in person, I pictured you\nas a cold, ruthless commander who would\nstop at nothing to achieve victory.
12	2	That's the Colony 30 Consul's fault...
13	5	Yeah. Valdi himself's got nothing but\nLevnis on the brain.
14	H	Hey, that's mean!
15	H	...Well, perhaps you're right.
16	H	I've been blindly sending Levnises\nto their destruction...
17	A	But you're only looking at one\naspect of the whole.
18	A	Aren't you furthering a large-scale project\nfor a new model?
19	A	I hear it's a type of Levnis designed for\na wholly different purpose.
20	H	Huh? How'd you hear about that?!
21	4	The survey branch has\neyes and ears everywhere.
22	3	"Oooh, look at me and the fancy\nspy network I used to work for!"
23	H	You're talking about Dorrick.\nHe's...my friend.
24	H	When he's finished, you've gotta\ncome visit!
25	A	I believe I will.
26	A	I look forward to building a lasting\nfriendship with Colony 30.
27	A	I'd be happy to accept your assistance\nin the future.
28	H	Great, I can't wait!\nGood news all round, huh!
evt/tq/msg_tq011604f.json
0	H	I'm back!
1	5	Hey. You taking it easy now?
2	ha1	Yeah.
3	ha1	You were gone for some time.\nIt wasn't just a quick there-and-back?
4	1	Yeah, one thing led to another...
5	na1	Sorry to butt in. Yuzet!
6	na1	The Nopon are in a real tizzy.\nWon't stop moaning about the\nlack of levnite...
7	ha1	Augh, they've finally gone and used it up?
8	6	Is it important?
9	H	It's an ore we use for Levnis maintenance.\nTune 'em up with it and they're gliding\nlike they're on ice.
10	ha1	We're already negotiating with Colony 4\nto get us some of theirs.
11	ha1	I, uh...don't suppose you could try to\nsmooth things over with the crew?\nJust for the time being?
12	na1	Oof. Well, I'll see what I can do.
13	xa1	Yuzet, you know that transmission we\nreceived earlier? Well, there's a problem...
14	3	How much is this guy juggling?!
15	2	There's not much point in him trying to\nrecuperate here when he keeps getting\npestered like this...
16	ha1	What?! What do you mean,\nyou can't arrange the shipment?!
17	xa1	Ah, I wasn't privy to the details.
18	xa1	All I know is that some guy called Solon\nfrom Colony 4 told us to tell you.
19	H	Hey, Noah?
20	1	I know what you're thinking.
21	1	Let's take this to Colony 4.
22	H	Let's!
evt/tq/msg_tq011605f.json
0	@Z1	Hmm. These are not good tidings.\nEspecially when we're so swamped...
1	H	Excuse me! Are you Solon?
2	@Z1	Hm? Ah, yes? How may I help you?
3	H	I'm here about the levnite shipment\nto Colony 30.
4	H	I was told that you couldn't send it,\nand I was hoping to find out why.
5	1	Did you run into an issue?
6	@Z1	Well... We sent some of our compeers to\nDannagh Desert, but we haven't heard\nfrom them since.
7	@Z1	I can't exactly leave my post, so I was\ndeliberating as to how we should proceed.
8	5	You said the desert, right?\nAnywhere in particular?
9	@Z1	The richest levnite veins can be found\nby a landmark known as Glam Rock,\nso you might try there...?
10	2	That seems like enough to go on, right?
11	1	We'll head out there to look for them.
12	@Z1	You... You'd do this?
13	H	We can't just ignore someone in need.
14	H	And besides, we need to get\nour hands on that levnite.
15	@Z1	Well then, thank you very much!\nI hope to hear good news from you!
evt/tq/msg_tq011606f.json
0	6	There they are!
1	H	We'll have this sorted out in a jiffy!
2	1	Let's rush them down!
3	2	Fine by me!
evt/tq/msg_tq011607f.json
0	1	Are you all right?
1	_Z1	Yes, thank you!\nYou saved our skins!
2	_Z1	Never seen monsters like that before.\nThey really caught us off guard...
3	ic1	I really thought it was over for us.\nYou're lifesavers, you truly are!
4	jc1	Never seen critters like that before.\nThey really caught us off guard...
5	6	Yeah, it's weird that those\nmonsters were there...
6	4	One would usually expect them\nto reside in their natural habitat,\nabove the Great Cotte Falls.
7	9	So they decide to move house?
8	2	This isn't walking distance we're\ntalking here.
9	1	They'd have to have migrated from\ntheir old territory.
10	1	After what happened to those mountains,\nthe Ansels must have tried to take shelter\nbeneath the great falls.
11	3	I'll bet that's what pushed these\nguys out, and then they moseyed on\nover here to the desert.
12	_Z1	Our squad leader just gave us an update.\nYou're here to pick up the levnite?
13	_Z1	If you want, we can just give it to you\nhere. Saves you a trip back to Colony 4,\nright?
14	ic1	Solon just gave us an update.\nYou're here to pick up the levnite?
15	ic1	If you want, we can just give it to you\nhere. Saves you a trip back to Colony 4,\nright?
16	H	You sure?! Well, thanks!
17	5	This'll at least take one thing off\nYuzet's plate...
evt/tq/msg_tq011608f.json
0	H	Hold up. That Levnis...
1	oa1	Hey, Commander! Good to see you back.
2	H	Hey Zooza.
3	H	This li'l buddy's the Levnis we lent Isurd,\nisn't it? Doesn't he want it any more?
4	oa1	To thank us for your offer of cooperation\nwith Colony Lambda, they've sent us a fair\nbit of supplies and food...
5	H	Wow, all this?!\nI'll need to thank him a bunch!
6	na1	Ah, Commander, there you are!\nGuess what?
7	na1	Colony 4 just approached us with\na deal to receive regular shipments\nof levnite from them!
8	H	What? What? What?!
9	na1	I'll head down the docks,\nand tell everyone!
10	4	And just like that, it would appear that the\nbond between our respective colonies has\nbeen restored.
11	3	Nice one!
12	H	Huh?
13	5	He hasn't even realized, has he?\nCome on, man!
14	6	You brought everyone together, Valdi.
15	H	I...I did?
16	2	It's really quite amazing. Even though\nyou're all doing different things.
17	2	You help each other out in all sorts of\ndifferent ways.
18	1	That's right. And when there's something\nmissing, it always has a knock-on impact\nsomewhere else.
19	1	Sometimes you don't notice\nsomething's awry until after\nthat effect has manifested itself.
20	H	...Ahh.
21	H	You know, the world's kind of\nlike a Levnis, isn't it?
22	H	It's like a mesh of so many\ndifferent parts, all interconnected.
23	H	And because it's made up\nof all these different things and\npeople, it moves. It's alive.
24	9	So then, Valdi and Manana are also\nbelong to parts of world?
25	H	Not just us.
26	H	My buddies here are too.
27	5	Not just some tools to be used, eh?
28	H	Right, they're not.\nI'm just reaching for ideas right now...
29	H	But hey, I'm a mechanic. And if the\nworld's like a Levnis, then I sure as\nspark should be able to fix it!
30	H	I'll make a new "tomorrow",\nwhere we can all live in harmony.
31	8	Ambitious goal for grease monkey.
32	8	But willing to keep on radar.\nWith much giving of side-eye.
33	H	I'll take that as a compliment!
34	8	Was not compliment.
35	5	Well, I believe in you, mate.
36	5	You're Keves's number one mechanic\nafter all. You can't argue with that!
37	H	Haha! Shucks...
38	2	OK then, let's report in to Yuzet,\nshall we?
evt/tq/msg_tq011609f.json
0	H	Yuzet?!
1	2	Shouldn't you be lying down?
2	ha1	Nah, I'm feeling way better.
3	ha1	I'm not just putting on a brave face for\nyou guys, OK? ...I'm not!
4	3	Uh-huh, all right. If you say so.
5	H	Thanks for always getting us\nout of trouble, Yuzet.
6	ha1	Wha... Where'd this come from?
7	5	Turns out this guy's actually more\nthoughtful than you give him credit for.
8	ha1	Thoughtful...?
9	H	From now on, I'm helping you\nwith your chores!
10	H	So let's both do the best we can, and\nmake some of the finest Levnises the\nworld has ever seen!
11	ha1	Sure, count on it.
12	ha1	Uh, as if!\nOver my dead body!
13	H	Buh?
14	ha1	If I trust you with anything, things\nare gonna get way out of hand!
15	ha1	You just casually go and extend the\nleases on Levnis rentals...
16	ha1	You plain give away the materials that we\ncracked down on after we caught those\nguys illegally hoarding...
17	ha1	Every time you give a report, my blood\nruns cold! Think about how I feel trying\nto manage this stuff!
18	H	Ah, right... Um, sorry.
19	H	Still, I'm glad to see you're feeling well\nenough to give me a telling-off like that!
20	ha1	Glad?! But I'm seething with rage here!
21	H	Ahaha! Yeah, I can see that!
22	5	So uh, I guess none of this really sorted\nout Yuzet's workload problem, did it?
23	6	Yeah, I guess not. Huh...
24	2	But maybe this is a good way for them\nto "mesh" in the end.
25	1	Maybe it is. Remember what Isurd told us?
26	1	That you can't just look at one aspect\nof the whole? I think that's how it is with\nColony 30...
evt/tq/msg_tq011610t.json
0	ha1	It's a request from Colony Lambda's\nCommander Isurd.
1	ha1	I'll inform him that Valdi will be\ncoming to meet him.
2	ha1	It'll be a simple job, OK? Just hand over\nthe goods and that's that.
3	ha1	I just want to be sure of what's going on.
4	ha1	Looks like we're going to have to\ntalk to this Solon from Colony 4.
evt/tq/msg_tq011611t.json
0	qV	We've found the Ansels to reside\nmost frequently in the area above\nthe Great Falls.
1	qV	Likely because that's where their favorite\nfood, Sirius Anemones, is situated.
2	qV	After you've dealt with them, we'll need to\ninvestigate the extent of the changes to the\nvegetation.
evt/tq/msg_tq011612t.json

0	cX1	Hey! Don't you dare eat those potatoes!
1	5	Whoa dude, no need to yell at us.\nNobody's gonna steal your spuds.
2	cX1	Now you're making it sound like\nI'm being stingy!
3	cX1	I'm just worried, 'cause a lot of folks\nare getting ill eating stuff that's not\nin the manual.
4	1	You think those potatoes are the issue?
5	cX1	Probably. I've taken to calling them\n"emetaters". You know, like "emetic"?\n...Ugh, it's less funny when I explain.
6	cX1	Anyway, I've been warning everyone,\nso I thought it best to give you a\nheads-up too.
7	1	Well, that's pretty...unpleasant.
8	cX1	There are other problems\nbesides those. You're better off\ntalking to the others directly.
9	cX1	Sorry, I wish we had better news for you.\nIf we could at least learn how to cultivate\nthe fields properly...
10	cX1	Careful of the emetaters, yeah?\nDefinitely don't eat those.
11	cX1	There's other stuff as well, but...\nYou're better off talking to the\nothers directly.
evt/tq/msg_tq011701s.json
0	2	I've been wondering...
1	2	How's the Colony 9 farming initiative\ngetting along now?
2	I	Well, we've been tilling the fields and\nplanting seeds...
3	I	But they just won't grow. Even when\nit looks promising, the batch fails.
4	6	Even with Glitter Radishes?\nThose were in the manual.
5	I	No luck whatsoever.
6	I	I wish I could simply ask those radishes\nwhat the problem is...
7	3	Our man's gotta be pretttttty desperate\nif he wants to talk to vegetables...
8	2	Well, if you don't get an answer from\nthem, why don't we ask Juniper about it?
9	2	Colony Tau's got plenty of veggies\ngrowing in the area.
10	4	True. Tau has consistently proven their\nself-reliance, even without getting support\nfrom the Castle.
11	4	They may be able to impart some\nknow-how.
12	I	Colony Tau...?
13	1	Juniper's a good friend of ours.\nI'm sure they'll be able to help us.
14	I	...Understood.
15	I	Then I'd like to inquire without delay.\nCould I ask you to accompany me?
16	3	We're coming with you whether you like\nit or not! Ain't that what friends are for?
17	I	Thank you, Eunie.
18	I	Ah, but before we depart...
19	1	You want to stop by Kite's place, right?\nI was thinking it'd be a good idea to iron\nthings out with him first, too.
20	I	Well then, we have the same agenda.
21	5	Uh, you're not gonna keep us all in\nthe loop here? Come on, guys...
22	I	We're taking some of the toxic potatoes\nwith us. Perhaps Juniper will be able to\nadvise us on the matter.
23	5	Oh... Well, just say so next time!
24	I	You're making a mountain out of\na Riik-hill, Lanz. Stop pouting.
25	5	Sh-shut up! Who's pouting?\nI'm pouting?! You're pouting!
evt/tq/msg_tq011702t.json
0	cX1	So you're going to Colony Tau to meet\nsome archer that knows their veggies?
1	I	Exactly. We're thinking of discussing the\nissue with the fields in person, and-
2	cX1	Well, why didn't you tell me this sooner?!
3	cX1	I'll get Fox and the others to hold the fort\nwhile we're away. You guys go on ahead.
4	5	What, you're coming as well now?
5	cX1	I did say I'd work with you, didn't I?
6	cX1	Everyone'll be so relieved if we can get\nsome good news out of this...
7	I	All right.\nThen I'll see you there.
8	I	Oh, and I'd like to bring along one of those\npotatoes, if you don't mind.
9	cX1	Take as many as you like. Just take care\nyou don't mix 'em up and end up with a\nstomachache!
10	cX1	Right, then. I'll see you at Colony Tau!
11	cX1	I'll head over to Colony Tau myself\nsoon as that's done!
evt/tq/msg_tq011703f.json
0	I	...They seem to be growing nicely.
1	L	Yes, they should be ready for harvest\nsoon.
2	L	It's best to pick them just as soon as\nthey start to wilt.
3	I	You let them wilt? Even after nurturing\nthem so carefully?
4	L	You get a larger yield this way.
5	I	Incredible.
6	I	So they're not actually dying,\nbut rather making way for new life.
7	I	Much like us.
8	L	Now that you mention it, yes.
9	L	All life is built upon some kind of sacrifice.
10	I	Indeed. Life is a cruel thing.
11	I	Now that we are free of our Flame Clock,\nI am all the more aware of this fact.
12	L	I don't believe we've been acquainted yet.
13	I	Zeon, Commander of Colony 9.\nI do apologize for this sudden visit.
14	L	Juniper. I also act in the capacity of\nCommander, for Colony Tau.
15	1	We're here today to ask for your advice.

0		Hmm...
1		In the natural world, some plants contain toxic elements,\nusually to fend off predators.
2		I'd guess that these belong to that category.
3		I was afraid of this...
4		It must have been frustrating.
5		Yes... For the whole colony.
6		I don't mind the toil myself.
7		Such was my decision.
8		But as for my friends...
9		I'd rather...they simply enjoy the result.
10		I understand. I know that feeling.
11		I'd like to suggest a different crop,\ndrawing from our experience here.
12		Would you wait here a moment, please?
13		Whew! Finally caught up!
14		You took your sweet time.
15		Sorry. I lost my bearings.
16		So, uh, did you figure out the issue?
17		Sorry to keep you.
18		Look here, these will grow even in the harshest-

21		Ah- KITE!\nLieutenant! From uh, Colony 9!
22		Hello, Kite.
23		I'm Juniper. It's a pleasure to meet you.
24		Urgh!
25		What the-?! Why's my chest...?
26		Um...
27		Ah, j-just ignore me!\nI'm fine!
28		Are those...
29		my emetaters?!
30		Oh yeah, they do look similar...
31		They're not, right?
32		No... They're toxic!
33		I knew it. This is one of Agnus's-
34		Kite!
35		It's true, when considering root vegetables,\npoisonous tubers are relatively common.
36		However, these Spongy Spuds are-
37		Huh?
38		[ML:undisp ]Mmh...!
39		It's sweet!
40		Already more than edible.
41		You mean it's safe? Really?
42		Yes.
43		I think I'd bake 'em first, myself.
44		Silence, Lanz.
45		These spuds, they're the pride\nand joy of our colony.
46		I'm so glad you like them. Really.
47		I don't...\nWhere do you find this trust?
48		These were our enemies!
49		Yes, but not now.
50		I get that. I know that!
51		But still...\nIf only you weren't Agnian...

1	L	It's perfectly fine.
2	L	I think you should talk to your\nsoldier in private, though.
3	I	Let me be clear: we do not bear any\nill-will toward Colony Tau, nor do we-
4	L	I didn't mean as a commander.
5	L	More as...one person to another.
6	L	Your friends... Didn't you want them\nto be happy, rather than toiling and\nstruggling in vain?
7	I	...!
8	L	And one more thing:
9	L	The pivotal factor is the soil.
10	I	...Soil?
11	L	Check to make sure that there's\nEarthwormwood growing in your fields.
12	L	I'll forward the steps you'll need to take\nto your Iris for reference.
13	I	Ehehe...
14	L	...Did I say something funny?
15	I	No. I'm just pleasantly surprised\nat how earnest you are.
16	I	I'll take a look as soon as we're back\nat the colony. Oh, and...
17	I	If you've any problems on your end,\nwould you allow us to lend our support?
18	L	Problems...?
19	I	It wouldn't feel right if the goodwill\nonly went one way, am I right?
20	L	I understand. Let me consider.
21	I	I'm glad we could talk.
22	I	We'll make some wonderful fields yet.

0	5	Hey, you know what happens if you pull\nout Earthwormwood?
1	5	Its roots wriggle around and stuff,\nlike they're alive! Gives me the creeps!
2	6	Stop trying to worm your way out of this.
3	4	According to Juniper's information, the\npresence of Earthwormwood improves\nthe soil's drainage.
4	4	In other words, it makes for earth\nthat is best suited for potato-growing.
5	5	All right, already.\nI guess we just get on with it, yeah?
6	I	We just get on with it.
7	5	Can't find a single one of 'em.
8	2	I guess it's not the best soil.
9	cX1	I knew it was just some kind of trick...
10	cX1	There was no way it was\ngonna be that easy...
11	5	Look here, you...
12	I	Enough, Lanz.
13	I	Kite, I know you're worried about the\nfields. Come over here and let's talk.
14	cX1	...No need. I don't have\nanything to say to you.
15	I	...Right.
16	6	Umm... We probably wanna check out\nsome other sites? I guess?
17	1	Right. There should be some untended\nland not far from the colony.
18	1	Let's do a sweep.
19	I	We'll update you if we find anything.

3	3	...Eh, let's just move on to the next spot.\nHup, hup!
4	2	I can't see anything...
5	6	Guess there's nothing here...\nOh well.

4	I	Looks like we've found our spot.
5	I	I'll inform Kite.
6	6	You think he'll actually help us?
7	I	Don't worry.
8	I	He's a bit delicate in some areas, but\nwhen he starts something, he *will* see\nit through.
9	I	...Hm?
10	6	What is it?
11	I	I've lost contact.
12	3	What a jerk!\nNow he won't take your calls?
13	5	Whoa now... We should probably hear\nhis side of the story, yeah? Let's stop\nstirring the pot.
14	I	I've already talked to him.\nBut it didn't prove very effective.
15	2	He's taking this personally, so it'll\nprobably take some time.
16	2	Both of you are being too quick to judge.\nDon't be so hasty.
17	I	Hasty? Me?
18	3	It's like Juniper said. You need to speak\nto him man-to-man, not soldier-to-soldier.
19	3	Like how you talk to Lanz.
20	6	Oh yeah, why are you and Lanz always\nfighting, anyway?
21	I	He just gets on my nerves.
22	5	Sorry, what?\nRight back at you, pal.
23	I	Excuse me?
24	2	I don't think that counts as fighting, Sena.
25	3	Yeah, they're just havin' some banter.\nThat's how you should be with Kite too.
26	3	You're always talking on a\ncommander-lieutenant level.
27	I	I hadn't realized...
28	I	So... I've been issuing him orders instead\nof talking to him on an equal footing?
29	1	Talk to him again.\nI think it'll go better this time.

9	cX1	Yes! All right? I'll do it...\nI'll do my snuffing job.
10	cX1	OK, so... What are we planting?
11	I	Spongy Spuds. Juniper's already told us\nhow to grow them.
12	cX1	Oh, here we go again.
13	I	Don't grumble. That potato\nwas truly delicious.
14	cX1	Fine, whatever. Just gimme the spuds.
15	I	...
16	cX1	...What?
17	I	Of course... We still need potatoes to plant.
18	cX1	You didn't get them ready?!
19	6	Uhh... We were so focused on\nlooking for Earthwormwood...
20	I	It happens.
21	cX1	This isn't like you, Commander.\nDidja eat something funky?
22	I	...Nobody's perfect.
23	I	Even the most scrupulous perfectionist\nis liable to err. O-on occasion.
24	cX1	...All right, just hurry up and get some!
25	cX1	Spongy Spuds, right?\nLet's start with about 10 of those.
26	I	We'll gather them as fast as we can.\nShall we meet again in the fields?
27	cX1	Sure thing.\nJust send me the location by Iris.
evt/tq/msg_tq011711f.json
0	5	Now we can finally get planting!
1	4	No, that step comes last.
2	4	First we need to till the soil so that the\nseed potatoes can take root more easily.
3	6	So what's that actually mean, "till"?\nI think I'm a bit lost...
4	4	You toss the soil to trap the air in it,\nit seems. According to Juniper, there\nare three main layers of soil-
5	5	Yeah, yeah, so we just rough it up a bit.\nI getcha.
6	4	Lanz... The crudeness of your summaries\nnever ceases to amaze me.
7	cX1	There's not much point\nto it all, though, is there?
8	dX1	Come on now, don't be like that.\nLet's just do what we can.
9	eX1	It'll only take two ticks!
10	bX1	You and your ticks, man! It's not about\nspeed. We need precision here, folks.
11	I	Just follow the procedure I sent\nto your Irises. Ask me if there's\nanything you're unclear on.
12	1	OK then, guys. Let's do this!
13	2	This is looking good!
14	6	That was pretty fun, hey, Mimi?
15	4	And now we water them.
16	3	Ugh, I wish I was the one being watered.\nI stink of dirt...
17	I	Should we wait for the rain,\nin this instance...?
18	1	Yeah, I think it's best if we let nature\ntake care of the rest.
19	1	I get the feeling we should\ninterfere as little as possible...
20	4	But rainfall isn't always guaranteed.\nIf you rely too much on the weather,\nit may come back to bite you.
21	2	Then what if you control soil humidity\nas you wait for the rain?
22	2	And if ever the rain doesn't come for\na while, then you can water your crops\nyourself.
23	I	That sounds smart. Let's wait a while\nand see how things unfold.
24	bX1	You just leave that to us.
25	cX1	Aw, what...?
26	dX1	Zeon and the others aren't going to stick\naround here forever. Who else is there?
27	eX1	Besides, it'll only take two ticks!
28	I	Kite, can I trust you to handle it?
29	cX1	...Yeah, go on then.
30	dX1	Come back and have a look after the\nrain though, would you?
31	1	Right. We'll do that.

0	I	...
1	bX1	So, uh... Why isn't anything budding...?
2	I	The seed potatoes are rotting.
3	I	...Perhaps we gave them too much water.
4	dX1	Oh no...
5	1	Does the soil not drain properly?\nOr was it something else?
6	bX1	...It's my fault.
7	bX1	I was giving them extra water\nfrom time to time, 'cause I didn't\nwant them drying out...
8	dX1	Fox!
9	bX1	I thought I was being careful!\nNever considered that I might\nbe overdoing it.
10	I	Well... We'll just have to try this again.\nLet's wait for the next rainy spell.
11	bX1	Sorry, guys...
12	cX1	Don't blame it on yourself.
13	bX1	Yeah, but if I hadn't done this,\nwe wouldn't have to-
14	cX1	"Ohh, if only"! What's done is done, man.\nYou can't change the past.
15	cX1	So let's just recoup our losses and\ndo even better next time round.
16	bX1	Huh...
17	dX1	That's a good attitude, Kite.\nI like it.
18	eX1	I'm good either way, to be honest.
19	cX1	Heh... Classic Eastman.
20	bX1	...Guess I'll stick it out for a while longer.
21	bX1	Thanks, Kite.
22	3	Credit where it's due.\nThat was actually pretty good.
23	2	His words came from the heart.\nI think that's why it resonated with them.
24	1	Kite's always been annoyed at being\nsecond-best.
25	1	He knows the frustration of not\nliving up to his own standards.\nAnd that really struck a chord.
26	I	Complementing others' weak points\nhas always been a talent of his.
27	I	It's something I could never do.
28	cX1	Hey.
29	cX1	I think we'll go ahead and till the soil\nagain, take out the rotted spuds.
30	cX1	So if you don't mind...
31	1	Got it. We'll grab a new batch for you.
32	bX1	I'm really sorry about this...
33	bX1	We'll need you to get 10 more\nseed potatoes then.
34	1	Don't worry. We'll pick a really good\nselection this time, just you wait!
evt/tq/msg_tq011713f.json
0	I	Now we wait for the rain.
1	dX1	Come on, buds.\nStart your budding already...
2	6	I've got a good feeling about this one!
3	cX1	...
evt/tq/msg_tq011714f.json
0	dX1	Hahaha, we did it! They're budding!
1	6	Talk about suspenseful!
2	9	Manana excited for yummy harvest.\nHope they grow up big and strong!
3	6	Yeah. We need to take\ngood care of them.
4	1	Looks like it's going well.
5	I	Indeed.\nNow we can breathe a sigh of relief.
6	3	We'll wanna take care of the fertilizer now,\nright? How do we distribute it?
7	bX1	Actually, I have just the person for that.\nUrl's a dab hand at gardening.
8	bX1	I'm sure he'll be able to help us out\nif we explain our situation.
9	I	I'd appreciate that.
10	I	...Incidentally, where did Kite go?
11	dX1	Stormed off after saying he'd\ndone his field-tending duty.
12	dX1	...Guess he's still not over it.
13	bX1	I suppose it's time for us to pack up.\nWe can't just leave that guy alone.
14	bX1	...He's always been there for us,\nthrough thick and thin.
15	I	I know. You don't need to worry about us.
16	I	Make sure my lieutenant gets\nthe care he deserves.
17	bX1	Will do.
18	dX1	Oh, and I'm pretty sure Url will explain\nit for you, but you know the fertilizer?
19	dX1	Seems you make it by crushing\nup seeds, bones and plants, then\nmixing it all together.
20	dX1	Oh, and he also said that having a few\nHelix Conches on you would save him\nsome trouble.
21	eX1	You'll get that done in ten ticks. Or else.
22	1	Haha, that might be a little tight for us...\nBut we can certainly try!
evt/tq/msg_tq011715t.json
0	XX1	Commander Zeon! Long time no see.
1	XX1	I'll take any materials you have for\nthe fertilizer off your hands, OK?
evt/tq/msg_tq011716f.json
0	6	Whoa, they got so big!
1	9	Filled to bursting with lively!
2	4	Applying fertilizer ought to further foster\ntheir growth.
3	5	So we just sprinkle the stuff on top\nand then we're done!
4	4	Wrong. They need to be able to absorb\nthe nutrition easily, so first we combine\nthe fertilizer with some soil...
5	4	Then you spread the mixture\naround the roots.
6	5	So specific...
7	4	I've more or less memorized Juniper's\ninfo now. Let me know if there's anything\nyou're unsure of.
8	I	I can see his time in the survey branch has\nseeped in, right down to his marrow.
9	3	I suspect he might've actually been born\nwith it. He's just the meticulous type.
10	I	That's about all we can ask for.
11	I	I'm grateful.
12	3	I'll let him know.
13	3	All right, guess it's back to the grindstone.
14	I	Now to wait for more rainfall.
15	6	Ooh, I'm shaking with excitement!
16	5	Are you really?
17	6	Well, yeah! We all worked hard for this!
18	3	You tell 'em, love.
19	2	Let's see what the coming rain brings...
20	6	Yeah!
evt/tq/msg_tq011717f.json
0	5	These little guys have come a long way.
1	9	They in springtime of youth!\nGrowing up into fine young potatoes!
2	3	Nothing gets Manana excited like the\nprospect of a full belly.
3	6	Can you blame her?
4	9	Resounding no!
5	I	...?
6	I	Why have they changed color?
7	3	Huh?
8	6	...Aw no, they're withering!
9	6	Why, though...? It can't be time\nto harvest them yet, surely?
10	4	...I dread to think so, but it could be\none of the diseases mentioned\nin the reference materials.
11	4	The damage seems to spread from\nthe lesions here, on the root... They\nbear resemblance to the Black Rot.
12	3	Augh, they'd better not be. That's\nsupposed to cause rapid decay.\nSpreads easily, too.
13	I	Let's check the others for similar\nsymptoms, on the double.
14	I	Lend me a hand, everyone!
evt/tq/msg_tq011718t.json
0	1	It's no good. They've changed color...
1	5	Spark! These ones are ruined too, huh...
2	3	These ones're wilting...
3	2	They're changing color...
4	6	These ones failed too...?\nPoor things...
5	4	...It seems we're too late to save\nthese ones.
evt/tq/msg_tq011719t.json
0	1	We're looking good here.
1	5	These ones seem fine to me.
2	3	Think this one's all good!
3	2	I'm not seeing anything unusual. Good!
4	6	Phew, these all look healthy!
5	4	No notable issues.
evt/tq/msg_tq011720s.json
0	4	Judging by the state of the stems,\nI think we're on the mark.
1	4	It's the Black Rot, no question.
2	6	But they were looking so healthy until just\na little while ago...
3	2	Can't we help them somehow?
4	3	There's only one solution, and that's\nto dispose of all the infected stems.
5	3	Before the others all go bad. That's what\nJuniper's data says, anyhow.
6	5	That's less "helping" and more\n"harm reduction", though...
7	6	Can't we just pluck the bad leaves?\nLeave the rest there?
8	1	No... We have to pull out the whole stem.
9	6	We do?!
10	5	You realize what you're saying?\nAfter all the hard work we've put in...
11	1	I wish we could save them all, really I do.\nBut the rot is spreading fast.
12	2	Pull out the bad ones and that's the end\nof it. There's not much point in trying to\nfind alternatives, because at this rate...
13	I	A fierce debate you're having here.
14	5	What are you so laid-back about, chief?\nThis is Colony 9's future on the line here!
15	I	You're absolutely right.\nAnd I'm not being laid-back.
16	I	We simply have to pull out the afflicted\nstems to avoid losing everything. There's\nno other way.
17	4	Weed out the bad to save the rest...\nIt's something quite profound.
18	I	You may not think it, but I often lacked the\nbackbone needed of a commander.
19	I	Even this far into my terms, I often faltered\nand vacillated, questioning my actions.
20	I	That is, until you taught me about the\nimportance of failing and starting anew.
21	I	It was an invaluable lesson to learn.
22	5	...Had to really hammer it into that hard\nhead of yours before it stuck, though.
23	I	...I'll take that as a compliment.
24	6	If Zeon's not giving up, then neither am I!
25	6	We'll do what we can, and we'll do\nit right!
26	2	That's right. And we'd better start now.\nTime waits for no spud!
27	1	Right. Time to pull out the bad stems!
28	I	My friends... Thank you.
evt/tq/msg_tq011721t.json
0	1	Let's pull out these stems here.
1	1	That should do.
2	5	So we pull these things out, huh?
3	5	Whew. Guess that's us, then.
4	3	The bad stems have got to go...
5	3	Yeah, that looks about right.
6	2	I think we have to pull these ones out.
7	2	Whew... That's it.
8	6	Sorry, guys.\nIt's for the good of the fields...
9	6	Aaand done. Next!
10	4	We'll have to pull them out fully,\nroot and all.
11	4	Ugh... Got dirt in my eye...
evt/tq/msg_tq011722f.json
0	1	That looks to be all of them.
1	I	We'll have to monitor them for a\nshort while.
2	I	Take note of the state of the stems,\nnot just the color of the leaves.
3	6	We should fix up the soil too, right?
4	3	Think so. It's supposed to be bad if the\nunderground bits are exposed to light...
5	5	Might as well pull up the weeds while\nwe're at it too, huh?
6	4	Don't pull the potatoes themselves out!
7	5	Mate, I can tell the difference!
8	I	And then we hope for rain...
9	I	...
10	1	What's wrong?
11	I	Ah, I was just thinking.\nHow times change...
12	I	It wasn't so long ago that my sole thoughts\nwere about keeping the Flame Clock\ntopped up...
13	I	Now here I am, worrying about soil\nand potatoes, looking up at the sky.
14	I	I could never have imagined myself\nin such a position.
15	1	True. Who'd have thought you'd\nchomp on a raw potato, or admit\nto lacking a spine?
16	I	...Please, don't remind me.\nI feel flush just thinking about it.
17	1	But I think we've grown a lot closer\nas a result. I feel like I know you better.
18	1	Sometimes you don't really get to know\nsomeone until you've clashed first, and\nthen sorted out your differences.
19	I	Hehe. You don't beat around\nthe bush, do you?
20	1	Anyway, I think we've done what\nwe can here.
21	1	Let's report back in to Juniper.
evt/tq/msg_tq011723t.json
0	bW1	The Black Rot, you say?\nDid you deal with it accordingly?
1	1	We pulled out all the stems that had\ndiscoloration, but we're not sure if that's\ngoing to be enough to stop the spread...
2	1	We were wondering if you could take a\nlook for us, if it's not a bad time for you?
3	bW1	From what you're telling me, that might\nbe the best course of action, yes. You're\nreally having some bad luck...
4	bW1	By the way, do you have anyone keeping\nwatch over the fields?
5	1	Keeping watch? You mean like a patrol?
6	bW1	It's not just Colony 9 that are strapped\nfor food, remember.
7	bW1	You never know who or what could be\nlying in wait...
8	1	...Yeah, you're right. We'll get someone\non it right away. Thank you.
9	bW1	Anyway, I'll start getting ready for this trip\nto Colony 9.

3		Sorry. I couldn't stop them.
4		It's not your fault, Kite.
5		Besides, you were the first to come running here.\nDon't feel bad.
6		You were tending the fields, weren't you?
7		Trying to keep them safe, the whole time.
8		I couldn't just sit back.
9		But...there was hardly any point...
10		You shouldn't put yourself down.

13		Hrrrngh!

16		Hehe. Guess I don't know my own strength.
17		Thank you very much.
18		Are those...?
19		I'm afraid I failed to mention something.\nSpongy Spuds are quite special.
20		They actually use the field itself\nas a means of storage.
21		That's why you recommended growing them.
22		Astounding.
23		Sorry I doubted you.
24		The reason I didn't trust you before,\nit wasn't because you were Agnian.
25		No, it's because I was weak.
26		[ML:undisp ](concerned breath)
27		Now I don't expect you to\nforgive me or anything like that,
28		but I know I caused hurt. I'm so sorry.
29		Now come on, raise your head.
30		You refused to give in.
31		You struggled to change things for the better.
32		The way I see it, that's not weakness.
33		Not from what I hear, anyway.
34		You don't...
35		Nah, you... You don't even know me!
36		Making a change, Kite... It takes guts.
37		You're a good man.
38		We didn't admit it, but then again...
39		neither did you.
40		You know what?
41		No one's ever told me that.
42		I'm sorry about that.
43		I think from now on,\nI'll make an effort to remind you.
44		Kite... You're an asset to us all.
45		Commander?
46		Could I...
47		Could you perhaps help me with a problem,\nif your offer of support still stands, that is?
48		Sure. Ask us anything.
49		Would it be possible to...permit me to visit\nColony 9 more frequently?
50		Hmm?
51		That's no issue for me.
52		I'm not directly asking for help\nwith a specific problem.
53		But I'd like it...if we could build\nfriendly relations between us.
54		If that's all right?
55		Now I see.
56		Feel free to visit.
57		Any time.
58		[ML:undisp ](gentle laugh)
59		Same here!
60		Very happy to have you!
61		Thank you very much, Kite.
62		What's all this, then? Kite's acting weird.
63		What I'm more worried about...is what\nwill happen to the tending of the fields...
64		I'll be sure to ask them.\n...But maybe not right now.
65		Just look... They're having so much fun.

1	2	Right! We've really been trying\nto do our best.
2	3	Didn't realize how hard it was to\nhammer things into folk, though.
3	4	It's gratifying to see you acknowledge\nhow much work I've put into it, sir.

6	2	Uhm... Leaving that aside for a moment.\nIs the training going to continue?
7	J	Ah, yes, about that. I do believe that\nthe time to apply the finishing touches\nis approaching.
8	2	Finishing touches? You mean...
9	J	Yes! We're going to perform large-scale\nmaneuvers that encapsulate everything\nwe've done so far.
10	3	Yeah? Large-scale maneuvers?\nNow we're talkin'!
11	1	Do you think they'll be up to scratch when\nwe've completed these maneuvers, Teach?
12	J	I'd say so. Especially if all of you are\nprepared to participate, as well.
13	2	Of course! So when do we start?
14	J	Right now.
15	2	...Huh?
16	J	Actually, to be honest with you...\nthe preparations for the maneuvers\nare already complete.
17	J	All we need to do now is to get everyone\nover to the designated location, in fact.

19	J	You see, I anticipated that you'd reach\nthe end of the exercises at around this\npoint in time.
20	2	Teach can be a touch\npushy sometimes...
21	J	No, I don't think so! I just have so much\nfaith and confidence in your abilities.
22	1	Well...where should we go\nto get started?
23	J	Do you know Everblight Plain?
24	5	Yeah, 'course. We've even been in\na dust-up there, as I remember.
25	J	The new recruits have already departed\nfor the target location. They're probably\nthere already.
26	J	I'll share the full details of the\nmaneuvers once we've rendezvoused\nwith the rest of the forces.
evt/tq/msg_tq011801f.json
0	J	Everyone present and correct?\nThen I'll proceed with the mission briefing.
1	J	Before we start, please turn your\nattention upward for a moment.
2	2	Upward...?
3	6	Oh!
4	J	A number of containers, arranged by me\nfor the purpose of this maneuver have just\nthis moment made landfall.
5	J	Foots, Zakir and Kyrie...\nYour squads will get to the containers and\nrecover the contents. Quick as you can!
6	2	What about us?
7	J	You're going to be acting as an enemy.\nYou'll do whatever you can to prevent the\nrecruits from performing the recovery.
8	WY1	Huh? We'll be fighting against Mio's\ncrew...? But we'll get pulped!
9	cY1	Oh, please, no need to make quite\nsuch a fuss about it. This is simply\na training exercise.
10	XY1	Yeah, I mean, the big boys aren't\ngonna go full tilt at us newbies, surely?
11	J	You three. Listen very carefully\nto what I'm about to say.
12	J	Whatever opponent you may face,\nI forbid you to belittle or think ill of them.
13	J	From the moment you raise your Blade\nagainst theirs, you must project every\nounce of your power when you fight.
14	J	In that way, you do an honor\nto your opponent.
15	WY1	Honor...?
16	J	If you do not offer that honor\nto your opponent, then all that\nremains is the shadow of enmity.
17	J	If pure power is the only prize of battle,\nthen surely, this war will never end.
18	J	For the most sacred duty of every soldier\nis this: to stamp out evil at its source.
19	5	Bustin' out the big words as usual...
20	6	Heh... That's our Teach for ya!
21	J	Mio and companions! Do not\nhold back! Bring your full strength\nto bear on your juniors!
22	2	All right. We'll do our level best to\nassume the role of "enemy".
23	J	Very well.
24	J	Squads, to your positions.\nWait for the designated start time!
25	J	Iris communication is forbidden\nfrom this point. That is all. Disperse!
26	J	It's time. We should commence with\nour battle plans as well...
27	J	...Huh...?
28	2	Teach...? What is it?
29	J	Ah... I just had the feeling I was being\nwatched. A trick of the mind, perhaps.
30	5	C'mon! Let's get out there and grab\nthese containers, yeah? The rookies\nare gonna beat us to it!
31	J	Yes, indeed. We elders need to\ndemonstrate a bit of spirit!
32	1	Roger. Starting mission!
evt/tq/msg_tq011802f.json
0	bY1	Uhm... Thanks for helping us out\nthere, I guess?
1	5	Yeah, uh... No worries.
2	4	Considering we're meant to\nbe your enemy, I'm not sure\n"help" is the right word.
3	3	Even so, we couldn't just leave 'em\nto get mown down there, could we?
4	J	Hah. Chaos reigns supreme on the field\nof battle. Let this be a lesson to you.
5	2	Huh...? Aren't you guys in Kyrie's squad?
6	bY1	Yeah, that's right.
7	2	So where's Kyrie?
8	bY1	She's not here...\nI guess she's gotten lost, as usual.
9	J	Ah, life's compass is never\nset on a single course.
10	1	Huh? So she wandered off again?
11	6	That's our Kyrie...
12	2	What should we do, Teach?\nDo you want us to look for her?
13	J	No... Let's leave it to them.\nThis too is a part of the training.
14	bY1	Roger that! I'll track her down, then.\nThough to be honest, I don't fancy\nmy chances...
evt/tq/msg_tq011803f.json
0	WY1	Zuno! Namuki!
1	WY1	Anyone! Is anyone there?
2	WY1	Urgh... I picked a great time\nto get lost, didn't I?
3	WY1	So what now...?
4	WY1	No... I can't just stay here.\nIt's getting worse!
5	WY1	I need to step up to the plate...\nBe more like Mio!
6	kY1	...
evt/tq/msg_tq011804f.json
0	cY1	Crap... Nothing else for it.\nAll units! Retreat, double quick!
1	4	Considering the state of play, they picked\na good moment to withdraw.
2	J	Indeed. Zakir's going to be a solid addition\nto the force, thanks to your instruction.
3	4	I can't take all the credit. It's down to their\nsuperb teamwork, as much as anything.
4	5	Yeah! We bagsied the container!
5	6	Can't wait to see what we got!
6	3	Shouldn't give the others a chance\nto regroup. Let's just swipe it and\nskedaddle!
7	J	Ha! It seems you're relishing your roles\nas the bad guys. Good casting by me!
8	4	...
evt/tq/msg_tq011805f.json
0	3	What? There's no one here?\nAre we the first?
1	5	Huh? That sucks. What an anticlimax!\nOh well. Let's recover the container.
2	XY1	Not so fast!
3	6	Who, what, where?!
4	1	W-we're surrounded!
5	J	So it seems.
6	XY1	You thought us rookies were\ngonna be a pushover, didn't you...?\nWell, joke's on you now.
7	YY1	Fork it over!
8	ZY1	We've got a full head of steam over here!\nAnd you're gonna get all of it. Sorry!
9	5	Haha! Just how I like it! Come at us,\nmudders! Nothin' like a chump with a\ndeath-wish!
evt/tq/msg_tq011806f.json
0	YY1	Snuff it... I think we're stuffed here.
1	ZY1	You really handed it to us...\nWe're gonna have to call it quits.
2	1	Hey, don't think of it like that.\nYou drew a pretty sharp line in\nthe sand there.
3	2	Right! And I'd say that means\nyou've still got room to grow.\nSo don't let up now!
4	XY1	That means a lot.
5	6	Well, guess we'll be yoinking the\ncontainer then. Unless you rookies\ngot another round in you.
6	XY1	No... I know when I'm beat.
7	6	You sure about that? I thought you liked\na bit of hard sparring. Even more than\nstrength training!
8	3	You still bitter about that, Sena?
evt/tq/msg_tq011807f.json
0	J	Excellent! Your duty is fulfilled,\nand admirably at that!
1	J	Let's return to the original\nrendezvous point.
evt/tq/msg_tq011808f.json
0	WY1	Oh... That's weird.\nI thought it was round here...
1	WY1	Urgh... Did I go off in the\nwrong direction again?
2	WY1	...
3	WY1	N-no! I-I can't have. Everything's\ntotally fine. Nothing to worry about!
4	WY1	...Ohh...
5	WY1	Waaaaah! A K-K-Kevesi soldier?!\nWh-what am I gonna do?!
6	WY1	(whimper)
7	WY1	Nooooooo!!!
evt/tq/msg_tq011809f.json
0	J	Everyone, thank you\nfor your perseverance.
1	J	In these maneuvers, you showed\nquality, doggedness and grit in the\npursuit of excellence.
2	cY1	But...we've gotta face it.\nWe got trashed.
3	5	Hey, don't be down on yourself.\nYou proved you got the right stuff, yeah?
4	4	The amount of pressure and problems\nyou gave us... I'd say that's pretty\npromising for new recruits.
5	J	While the leader of each squad is present,\nthere's something I'd like to announce.
6	bY1	Ah...I guess I'll have to stand in for Kyrie.\nWe haven't found her yet.
7	J	What...?
8	1	I guess we'll need to mount\na proper search for her.
9	3	Sheesh...\nShe's a real test of patience, that one.
10	J05J0	Yes, Teach speaking.
11	kY103kY10	So, you're calling yourself "Teach" now?\nInteresting.
12	J03J0	Wh-what?! Who...?
13	kY103kY10	But that's not all that's interesting.\nFor example...
14	kY103kY10	...what became of that soldier of yours,\nthe one blindly wandering around the\nbattlefield back there. Where is she now?
15	kY104J0	You...! What have you done with Kyrie?\nYou'd better not have hurt her.
16	kY103kY10	It's all down to you now, "Teach".\nYou'd better start the search for her.
17	kY103kY10	Seek help from your comrades, then.\nBring your reinforcements. It makes no\ndifference to me.
18	kY103kY10	But, hear this. I won't let you escape.
19	J03J0	Forgive me, but I cannot follow\nyour meaning. You aren't making\na shred of sense!
20	kY103kY10	A clue... "Remember Chi"!
21	J03J0	(gasp)
22	kY103kY10	Think of me as...\na ghost from your past.
23	1	Teach... What just happened?\nIs something up with Kyrie?
24	J	It appears that Kyrie has been abducted\nby a mysterious party.
25	2	Abducted...? But...who would...?
26	J	I don't know yet. I sense a Kevesi\nhand in this, or...perhaps...
27	1	Well, we'd better get out there\nand help her!
28	J	No! Kyrie is my responsibility!
29	J	Please lead the troops back to the colony.
30	5	Hey... C'mon...
31	bY1	Uhm...Commander! Don't worry about us!\nWe'll be OK!
32	XY1	We may be a buncha rookies, but I think\nwe can get ourselves back to the colony\nin one piece, Commander, sir!
33	J	Zuno... Foots...\nBut...
34	cY1	Commander! I also think...that might be\nthe best course of action!
35	cY1	We'd just slow you down. But if you take\nNoah and the others, you've got a much\nbetter chance of finding Kyrie.
36	3	Spark, guys...
37	J	Understood. You're right.\nTake yourselves back to the colony.
38	J	Everyone, listen up. I'm going to have to\nask you to assist in the search for Kyrie.
39	2	We were here for that from the start,\nCommander! Let's find Kyrie.
40	1	That means we're going to have to find\na way to search this vast expanse...\nIt'll be tough.
41	J	Perhaps it won't be so tough.\nI've already formed a broad concept\nof Kyrie's current location.
42	6	Huh? Really?
43	J	Rottswoe Battlescar is the site of an\nancient battlefield in the west of\nEverblight Plain.
44	J	I surmise that Kyrie is deep within\nthat zone.
45	5	How come you're so certain, Teach?
46	J	Time is short. I'll explain on the way!
47	bY1	Commander! Please...\nBring Kyrie back safely!
48	J	On my honor, I swear it!\nAnd you must promise to be vigilant\nuntil you've safely returned home!
evt/tq/msg_tq011810f.json
0	J	There's...something I need to\ntell you about before we proceed.
1	2	Is it...to do with why you knew\nwhere Kyrie was?
2	J	That's right. You see...I have an idea\nthat our mysterious opponent's true\ntarget is...myself.
3	6	So then...he only snatched\nKyrie to get to you...?
4	J	Exactly. He took her as nothing more than\na hostage to lure me out. Considering this\nangle, the pieces start to fit together.
5	4	Commander! Does this mean that you\nknow the identity of our opponent here?
6	J	Not for certain...but I have a hypothesis.
7	J	And if that hypothesis is correct...\nthen Kyrie should be just up ahead.
8	5	So...what is it then?
9	J	Cause and effect.
10	2	What...? Something you did in the past?
11	J	A colossal struggle took place on this\nbattlefield, a long time ago.
12	J	Keves and Agnus lost countless lives\nin that battle. In the end, both sides were\nannihilated.
13	J	Afterwards it was said that the ones that\nlet loose the dogs of war were Colony Chi.\nThat this slaughter was their doing.
14	J	"Remember Chi", they said.
15	4	Of course, I've read the tales\nof that battle too. But what does\nthat have to do with all this?
16	J	We'll need to save Kyrie, if we're to truly\nuntangle the whole of this intrigue.
17	2	Well, whatever the truth of the\nmatter, one thing doesn't change:\nwe need to save her!
18	J	But if I'm right...I need to put an end to\nthis for good. Stamp out evil at its source.
19	J	Or otherwise...
20	J	Kyrie...\nPlease...be safe.
evt/tq/msg_tq011811f.json
0	J	Kyrie!
1	WY1	C-Commander Teach!
2	J	Are you all right? Are you injured?
3	WY1	I-I can't...stand...\nI'm...sorry...
4	2	You're in one piece at least...\nSomething to be thankful for.
5	J	Yes. It looks like we've narrowly avoided\nthe very worst outcome. But...
6	kY1	The way you talk... The way you act...\nIt's as if you're a different person.
7	kY1	Or do my eyes deceive me? No.\nYou knew the meaning of this place.\nIt must be you.
8	2	Are you alone? Do you have allies?
9	kY1	Look at that Ferronis.
10	kY1	The last bit of life burning within\nits Flame Clock...is mine.
11	kY1	This is where my friends died.\n...Slaughtered to the last.
12	kY1	By the hand of Colony Chi's commander,\nthe man dubbed the "All-Slayer"...
13	4	You... You're a survivor of that battle!
14	kY1	That's right. Just like him.
15	J	I can understand well what it is you want...\nBut why act in this way?
16	kY1	Luring you in with this\nlittle nobody, you mean?
17	kY1	Heh... If I hadn't taken such measures,\nyou would have gotten away from me.
18	kY1	Just as you'd given me the slip by\nchanging your identity. Running from\nthe past.
19	J	I know that I can never escape\nmy past, not ever.
20	J	But I chose a different path. I chose to live\nwith the past as a burden I must bear.
21	kY1	A wonderfully convenient use of logic.\nDo you suppose it will persuade the\ndry and dusty bones of the dead?
22	kY1	Enough of your sophistry and lies!
23	J	Ngah!
24	kY1	THIS is the purpose I lived for!\nWhy I endured the pain of being\nthe final survivor of my people!
25	kY1	Well, it's all about to come to an end.\nI will kill you as an offering to my friends!
26	J	It seems you're bent on fighting me.\nWhat if there were another way?
27	kY1	Bah! Please, enough! You dare to\ndespise me? To look down upon me\nas a worm, an insect?
28	kY1	I...I'm not the weakling you think I am...\nAt least I don't throw away my friends\nlike spent trash!
29	kY1	I'll kill you... I'll kill you all...!\nYou'll see! Oh you'll see!
30	1	Teach! Be careful!\nThat's no regular Kevesi soldier!
31	kY1	Your death is long overdue, Oleg!
evt/tq/msg_tq011812f.json
0	jY1	What's the matter, Oleg?\nIs this all the strength you can muster?
1	J	Your hope, your desire, is to kill me.
2	J	That being so, there is no meaning in\nour fighting. Just do what you will, now.
3	jY1	You mean to insult me even now?\nFighting a weakling like me isn't\nworth the effort? Is that it?
4	J	No, you're wrong!\nYou don't understand at all.
5	jY1	Then fight! Fight like you fought my allies,\nlike you crushed the life from their bodies!\nShow me your true nature, your fangs!
6	jY1	Kill me, Oleg, crush me!
7	J	...
8	jY1	Coward! I won't stop, not until I bring\nthe red mist down upon you!
9	jY1	If it takes laying down this rookie's corpse\nto get a rise out of you, I'll do it!
10	WY1	Hey! I'm no rookie!
11	jY1	Wha-?!
12	J	Huh? Kyrie?!
13	5	Uh? Hey! When'd she get back up?!
14	2	Kyrie, if you're back on your feet,\nescape while you can!
15	WY1	N-no! I won't run away!\nI'll fight by your side, with all of you!
16	3	Don't be a fool!
17	WY1	I-I'm not! I'm doing what the\nCommander told us to do!
18	WY1	Do honor to your opponent!\nFight them with every ounce\nof your strength!
19	J	Kyrie, you're...
20	WY1	Th-that's why I...why *we* fight!\nMe, you, Mio, Commander... All of us!
21	WY1	I am a warrior of Colony Gamma!
22	J	...
23	J	She's right... I forgot the very thing I told\nmy students to guard in their hearts.
24	J	It was me that lacked maturity,\nthat hadn't grasped the basic truth.
25	J	Certainly, your technique... It's amazing.
26	J	It's only natural. You've applied yourself\nto discipline which forces you to stare\ndeath in the face.
27	jY1	...
28	J	Since you've borne that burden,\nI ought to fight you with my whole\nstrength and spirit!
29	J	To meet your passion,\nI will unbind my darkest arts!
30	J	Kyrie! Please! Lend me your powers!
31	WY1	Roger that, Commander!\nI'll give it everything!
32	jY1	...As you wish. More kindling for\nthe carnival of carnage!
33	jY1	Show me these darkest of arts, Oleg!\nTeach me what you mean!

13	2	You...want me to see him off, don't you?

evt/tq/msg_tq011815f.json
0	J	Thank you. Perhaps now, his soul\nwill find some respite.
1	1	Yeah... I hope so, too.
2	J	Please, allow me to thank you once again.\nIf you hadn't backed me up today, who\nknows what could have happened?
3	2	Teach, don't mention it.\nWe did exactly what we had to.
4	J	Kyrie, you acquitted yourself very well\nin battle. You've made true progress.
5	WY1	R-really? I-I was really useful to you?
6	2	Yeah! I'm seeing you in a whole new\nlight now, Kyrie. You're a credit to the\nAgnian forces!
7	WY1	Whoa... I'm so happy to hear you say that,\nMio. Feeling a little dizzy now...
8	4	Teach... I need to ask.\nJust who are you exactly?
9	J	...
10	4	The Kevesi soldier was calling you "Oleg"...
11	4	That was a name that used to ring out\nin Agnus, too... A commander whose\nmartial prowess was nigh unmatched.
12	4	According to the official records, Oleg\nfell in battle, many years ago.
13	4	If what that soldier said was true,\nthen you're...
14	J	Taion... It's wise of you to press me\non this matter.
15	J	But... You must forgive me.
16	J	I'm afraid...I cannot tell you\nany more about that name.
17	4	Is that because...we haven't\nearned your trust?
18	J	No, it isn't that... It's something else.\nI'm bound to a promise, an oath.
19	2	An oath...?
20	J	"To impart wisdom to those who will\nsucceed us. To teach them of strength,\nand the tenets of battle."
21	J	"That this humble wish should spark,\nwe pledge never to divulge the secrets\nof the past."
22	J	That's the oath that I took with Consul G.
23	1	Consul G? The same Consul G\nthat we took down?
24	J	By way of that oath, Consul G gave me a\nnew name and a new role, as an educator.
25	4	But...why would you be forbidden\nfrom talking about the past?
26	J	Because you see...\nI have no right to do so.
27	J	However many words I expend talking\nabout the past, they would be nothing\nmore than a collection of empty excuses.
28	J	I'd merely be setting down the burden of\nthe past in the hope of being forgiven.
29	J	So...the Consul...strictly forbade it.
30	J	I must preserve my oath,\nas long as I draw breath.
31	2	I see... But this must be a huge\nweight for you to carry.
32	2	I mean, you can't share your worries\nor your troubles with anyone.
33	J	...
34	1	Teach...\nAbout the past...
35	1	Are you also against us trying\nto find out about it?
36	J	No...
37	J	Of course, you are not bound by oath.
38	J	Just as I have no right to divulge the past,\nI have no right to obstruct those seeking\nthe truth, either.
39	J	If you want to uncover the past,\nthat is a matter for you, and you alone.
40	5	Hey, sorry mate, I kinda lost\nthe thread a bit there...
41	4	Perhaps we can revisit that another time.
42	3	It's getting on. The others must really be\nstewing in their juices about Kyrie.
43	2	You're right. Let's get back and\nlet them know she's safe!
44	WY1	Roger that, Mio!
45	J	...Please, go ahead without me.\nI'll catch you up.
46	2	I understand.

5	K	Don't trouble yourself, Chickadee.\nI'll hear it from him directly.

7	K	...
8	K	...Continue.
9	db1	I know you're reluctant!
10	db1	But now that we've been released from the\nFlame Clock, and the wall between Keves\nand Agnus has crumbled...
11	db1	Now's the perfect time to institute a tech\nexchange! If it's successful, it could even\nlead to stronger, more lasting peace...!
12	4	You had problems with Colony 30\nin the past?
13	Yb1	We...fought against them before,\njust once.
14	Yb1	But they absolutely wiped\nthe floor with us...
15	Yb1	Never before or since has Dame Alex\nmisread an enemy to that degree.
16	Yb1	The bitter aftertaste from that\nevent has lingered for years,\ngiving us all headaches...
17	K	Who's bitter at whom, now?
18	K	It doesn't sound half bad.\nLet's have a technology summit!
19	db1	Really?!
20	Yb1	Dame Alex...
21	K	Keves's Colony 30 stands at the\nforefront of technology. This is not\na problem in the slightest.
22	K	Truly, not even a speck of one.
23	Yb1	Now we've done it...
24	K	Chickadee. Contact Colony 30.\nTell them I'm coming.
25	Yb1	Yes, understood!
26	K	Gambert, we will rendezvous there.\nI'll bring results home, you'll see.
27	db1	Of course, ma'am!\nI'll depart on the double!
28	5	They've definitely got skills there...but this\nis Valdi we're talking about. I don't think\nyou need to get so worked up.
29	K	Suppose I told you that Colony 30...
30	K	...was currently struggling with an urgent\nwater shortage. What would you imagine?
31	5	Huh? Oh, I dunno...\nBurst water mains or something?
32	6	Or their spring dried up...?
33	K	Incorrect. The right answer was,\nbig cleaning project at the colony.
34	5	Oh, you have got to be joking.
35	K	Regrettably, I am not.\nIt really happened.
36	6	That...does kinda sound\nlike Valdi though, huh?
37	4	There are also many Nopon living\nthere. They tend to follow their own,\nunique rules.
38	K	Precisely. They are unique, and therefore\nworth studying in greater depth.
39	K	Knowing your opponent and preparing\naccordingly - that is the foundation of\nany battle.
40	1	Do you still consider Colony 30\nyour enemy then, Alexandria?
41	K	This isn't about enemies or allies.\nAll I'm saying is that the side that\ngets careless, loses.
42	4	So your strategy is outright distrust, then?
43	K	What are you trying to say?
44	4	Hurt others first, to avoid being hurt\nyourself. Do you think that's logical?
45	K	...It's a matter of opinion.
46	1	And you're entitled to that. Say what\nyou will, but they've got a good colony\nover there.
47	1	Ah, right. If you don't mind, could we\nattend this technology summit of yours?
48	1	We could help introduce\nyou and Valdi too.
49	K	Yes... I daresay with you by my side,\nthey may be less guarded than otherwise.
50	K	I suppose I may require your assistance.

1	db1	This... This is all just...\nSO over the top!
2	K	Yes, though mainly your reaction.
3	H	...Ah!
4	H	Welcome, welcome! I've been waiting!
5	5	Hey pal! How ya doin'?
6	H	Not too shabby, I s'pose!
7	H	Riku, chief! Manana!
8	9	Friend Valdi!\nManana missed friend!
9	H	Ahahah, no need\nto be shy, chief!
10	5	I envy you your energy levels, bud.
11	K	It has been a while.\nI'm glad to see you in high spirits.
12	H	Thank you! And yes, I'm pretty good!
13	H	...Erm. Who's this?
14	K	...
15	5	She's the commander from Colony Iota!\nYou got the message, right?
16	H	...Ohhhh!
17	H	You're Antixandria?!\nThanks for reaching out!
18	K	It's "Alexandria", actually. It would honor\nme greatly if you'd remember.
19	H	Alexandria! A pleasure to meet you.\nI'm the commander of Colony 30, Valdi!
20	H	This'll be my first technology summit!\nI'm really excited about this!
21	K	I myself, not so much.
22	5	Hey now...
23	H	Really? You don't like Levnises?
24	K	I don't! Especially yours.
25	H	I see... Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
26	H	Then I hope that by the end of the day,\nyou'll have learned to love them just\nas much as I do!
27	K	You're a credit to your colony,\nCommander. But don't you think you\nshould be on your guard, even a little?
28	H	Why would I?\nWe have no reason to fight.
29	K	You might be the only one who thinks that.
30	H	Ahahah, obviously not!\nIf I was, the others wouldn't\nhave brought you.
31	K	You trust them, don't you?
32	H	Just as you do, right, Alexandria?
33	K	...Yes, of course.
34	4	...
35	H	All right then, let me show you around!\nThere's lots of stuff on the ground,\nso you'll have to watch your step.
36	H	I have nothing to hide from friends.\nFeel free to look around!
evt/tq/msg_tq011902f.json
0	db1	I love it! Everywhere I turn,\nthere's hardworking Nopon.
1	H	Oh, they're not working.\nThey're just doing their own thing.
2	H	They snooze when they're sleepy and eat\nwhen they're hungry. Sometimes they just\nwander off.
3	K	...Still, they look quite busy.
4	K	What might they be making?
5	H	So, just listen to this!\nI've been thinking about it a while.
6	H	We're looking into constructing a smaller,\nstronger Levnis, focusing on three pillars:\ndurability, serviceability and ease of use.
7	H	...Actually, the whole premise of our work,\nlike fixing things, might need rethinking. If\nyou put too many features on one Levnis...
8	H	...then you need more time and parts and\nit ends up costly and hard...not to mention\nthe handling, so to get out of the cycle-
9	K	All right! Calm down now.
10	H	...Huh? But I was calm.
11	db1	Ahahahaha!\nI like this guy already!
12	K	Ahah...
13	db1	...Ahem! This new model's design\nis really very interesting.
14	H	Thank you! I'm happy you think so!
15	H	Oh, hey! Do you wanna work with us?\nWe've just been looking for team\nmembers for Project Bingo.
16	db1	"Bingo"...?
17	H	It's what I'm calling this new model. I was\nthinking about it, and when I figured it out,\nit was like, "Bingo!" so we named it that.
18	db1	Sounds great! I spend lots of time thinking\nabout stuff too, so I'd love some hands-on\nexperience to really improve and...
19	K	Gambert...?
20	db1	...By which of course I mean, do you have\nany units in a state closer to completion?
21	H	Sure I do! I just made friends with\none such unit recently, in fact!
22	K	What do you mean, friends...?
23	H	I'll introduce you!\nShe's in the hangar over there.
evt/tq/msg_tq011903f.json
0	H	Ah, there she is!
1	5	What the-?!
2	H	Wait wait wait!\nRobobuddy is a friendly!
3	db1	Robo...buddy?
4	H	Heheh, it's this little one's name!
5	5	...Where'd you pick it up?
6	H	Oh, she was strolling about outside.
7	5	It must've been on patrol, dude!\nDid you have to go and drag it in?!
8	db1	It doesn't treat Kevesi as hostiles...
9	db1	Or does it not even distinguish\nbetween Keves and Agnus...?
10	db1	But why would that be?\nSome error in the control circuits...?
11	H	There's no errors here!\nAnd she's not broken.
12	K	You're conversant with Agnian technology?
13	H	No way! I guess I dabble, but there's tons\nof stuff I don't understand there. That's why\nI started tinkering with those that I do.
14	H	First, the question of how Agnian\nAuto-Levs operate autonomously... I think\nit's mostly to do with ether signaling, but...
15	H	...I figured, if we could break it down,\nwe might be able to transmit stuff\nback to them from our side as well.
16	H	Anyway, I spent ages wracking my brain\nabout it, but if you look at stuff like friend-\nor-foe identification, it gets mixed up.
17	db1	Wait, wait, back up.\nAre you saying you can control it?!
18	H	Well, it's not that precise, really...\nBut at least we're friends now!
19	H	Right?
20	db1	Is this for real...?!
21	4	If they actually succeed at\nimplementing this at scale...
22	db1	Yeah! It would turn the rules\nof engagement right on their\nsparking head!
23	4	Valdi, what are you having Robobuddy do?
24	H	Just moving and disposing of materials.\nIt's still in the test phase, so we're keeping\nthings simple.
25	4	And which section is in charge?
26	H	That would be the Bingo guys... Why?
27	K	Why don't I ask you straight?\nAre you planning to use it as a weapon?
28	H	No flipping way!\nI would never.
29	H	She's not for fighting! I made friends\nwith her to stay friends with her!
30	K	Well if that's the case, then it would\nseem you've missed your mark.
31	K	Your friend seems to have other plans.
32	H	Robobuddy?! Why?
33	K	No use debating it. Ready arms!
evt/tq/msg_tq011904f.json
0	H	Robobuddy...
1	K	Well, that makes things clear.
2	K	Somebody within Colony 30 has been\nsecretly misappropriating materials.
3	H	Misappropriating...?\nWhat're you talking about?
4	K	Look at the Collectopaedia Card.
5	K	You said the three pillars for your new\nLevnis were durability, serviceability and\nease of use.
6	K	However, you'll notice that the\nmaterials Robobuddy was collecting\nwere Waning Lapis and Venollium...
7	K	A brittle rock, and a highly scarce metal.\nWhat ought we to think about that?
8	H	Oh, you're right...\nThis isn't what I asked for!
9	H	But hang on, Alexandria...\nHow did you know to check\nour Collectopaedia Cards...?
10	1	I asked her to. I figured it might help...
11	1	And it looks like I was right.\nDo you have any idea who\nthe culprit might be?
12	H	Not at all! Maybe it's all just\na big misunderstanding...?
13	4	No, Robobuddy clearly turned hostile\nand attacked us. Which is to say...
14	4	...it must have been under the control\nof someone other than Valdi.
15	1	But what were they after...?
16	K	...Might it have been to make a poison?
17	H	Poison?!
18	K	Yes, both of those materials contain\ncertain toxic compounds.
19	K	Of particular note is the lack of identifiable\nscent or flavor. When mixed in with food,\nthey are nearly unnoticeable.
20	4	Well, someone's well-read.
21	K	Our Consul had some shady hobbies,\nand he liked to talk.
22	H	So...\nWhat would happen if you swallowed it?
23	K	Depending on the concentration...
24	K	Dizziness, numbness, diarrhea, emesis...\nAnd in more severe cases...
25	H	Yeeeeeuughh,\nenough, enough!
26	db1	...Oh, fantastic.\nI managed to retrieve the logs.
27	db1	If we analyze them, we should be able\nto figure out where it came from...\nIs that OK...?
28	H	A-OK by me! We gotta stop the baddies!
29	4	...All right, then.\nSorry to use your friend like this.
30	H	Looks like the friendship part\nmight've all been in my head...
31	H	But thanks for thinking of it\nthat way, anyway.
32	K	Honestly, such carelessness...
33	1	Alexandria...\nYou've been looking sad all this time.
34	K	Huh?
35	1	Is something the matter?\nAnything we could help with?
36	K	I'm... I'm used to all this...\nand I hate it.
37	1	Alex? Did you hear me?
38	K	It's nothing. You don't have to worry.
39	db1	...All right, analysis is complete.\nYou can unpack the data whenever.
40	K	Good job, Gambert.\nWhy don't you wait here?
41	K	Commander.\nI trust I can leave my man with you?
42	H	Huh? I thought I'd be going with you!
43	4	There may be other machines\nlike Robobuddy.
44	4	You're the only one who can tell\nthem apart. Let's tackle both threads\nsimultaneously.
45	H	...Yeah, OK.
46	H	I'll stay in the colony this time, then.\nGive Robobuddy's boss my regards.

45		Even better!
46		She made her accomplices\nteam leaders to shut them up,
47		and they're still chumming it up today!
48		Alex...
49		He's telling the truth. I regret nothing.
50		He wasted men and resources,
51		clung to outdated tactics...
52		If his tyranny continued,
53		Iota would surely have collapsed.
54		Ohhh, how grisly! How ghastly, never knowing\nwhen one might die in one's sleep!
55		Unable to trust your friends...
56		Nay, I'd go so far as to say\nthey lost their trust in *you*!
57		That's right. And so...
58		I'm not asking you to trust me.
59		You rose to some cheap bait there.\nThat's not like you.
60		Taion?!
61		Everyone's got some husks in their closet.\nAnd as for me...

32	uW1	I don't know if you're aware, but the\npeople of Tau themselves chose to\nbreak the Clock.
33	uW1	It's hardly my place to complain.\nI happen to be quite the individualist,\ndon't you know.

37	6	Uh, Noah?\nWe're just letting Juniper go?

41	5	A job? For us?
42	uW1	For you. I'd like you to procure\nsome Twineturf. For me.
43	3	Yeah? And what're you using it for?
44	uW1	Someone's got to remove those\nnuisances for new life to settle in.

15	L	I mean, I don't really sense any hostility\nfrom her... Maybe it's fine?
16	5	But you have to admit, she's got a way of\ngetting on your nerves, right?
17	4	Still, she is a Consul. If we\nunderestimate her, we'll no doubt\nbe in for a world of pain.
18	1	Noted. But even if we do have to fight,\nit'd have to be outside of the colony.
19	2	Yeah. We don't know what she\nmight be planning to do with the\npeople of Colony Tau...
20	1	We should try to head back soon.

0	4	Is that enough for you?
1	uW1	Wonderful, my dear Ouroberries.\nQuite the speedy little workers, aren't you?
2	5	So? How're you gonna use the stuff?
3	uW1	We're going to make it into a pulp\nand throw it into a bonfire.
4	uW1	I hear it has the most fragrant aroma.\nNo doubt the creatures will be drawn\nstraight to it.
5	uW1	A little assistance wouldn't go amiss.\nYou!
6	Yd1	Huh? Ah, yes?
7	5	Pfft. What a farce...
8	4	They're drawn to the scent, are they...?
9	2	What is it, Taion?\nYou picked up on something?
10	4	Ah, not exactly.
11	uW1	Ugh, what is this? I do so hate\nthe forest, what with all the bugs...
12	Yd1	Um, right... Well, they do say\nthat bugs hate smoke...
13	uW1	You know the type of insect I hate\nthe most? The creepy-crawly kind.\nUgh, ghastly things. How about you?
14	Yd1	Me? I've seen 'em all before.\nCan't say they bother me...
15	uW1	Oh.
16	uW1	Such a tedious little corner of Aionios.\nNothing much ever happens around here,\ndoes it?
17	Yd1	No, not really...\nI'm kinda used to it by now, though.
18	uW1	Well of course you would be.\nState the obvious, why don't you!
19	Yd1	Right... Sorry, ma'am.
20	uW1	Now throw in the plants I gave you\nand we should be all set for the\npreparatory phase.
21	Yd1	Uh, where are you going, ma'am?
22	uW1	Oh, you know. I thought I might witness\na little of that Ouroberry magic for myself.
23	uW1	The smoke rising from the bonfire acts\nlike a signal flare to indicate the start of\nbattle.
24	Yd1	Yeah? What's that got to do with-
25	Wd1	Crap. They're back - again!
26	Yd1	What?!
27	uW1	Looks like you've got your work cut out\nfor you. Oh yes, you had better live your\nlives to their *very* fullest...
evt/tq/msg_tq012003f.json
0	1	What?! These monsters...
1	Wd1	Don't ask me! They just showed up out of\nthe blue and started heading this way...
2	L	These monsters aren't from the forest.\nWhy would they have come in so far?
3	4	I have my hunches...
4	5	No point guessing right now!\nLet's send these guys packing!
evt/tq/msg_tq012004f.json
0	5	Gah! There's no end to 'em!
1	4	The appropriate tactic in this situation\nis fight first, whine later, "mate"...
2	5	Yeah, I know, "man"!\nMakes me feel better, though!
3	4	...
4	uW1	My dear, sweet little Junebug.
5	uW1	I'll tell you what I'm trying\nto accomplish here.
6	uW1	I want to see Colony Tau performing\nto the very best of their ability.
7	L	What?
8	uW1	I want them to wallow in regret,\nto agonize, tremble, suffer, writhe,\nconvulse...and then die.
9	uW1	You see, the look on their faces at that\nmoment is the most delectable thing in\nthe world to me.
10	L	Consul, I don't understand...
11	uW1	All that you are, distilled at the\ncusp of death to a perfect fraction\nof unbearable humiliation!
12	uW1	However...teetering there on the edge of\noblivion is also the moment in which you\nshine the brightest.
13	uW1	The terror of death flickering in your\nminds, fighting madly in the hope that\nyou still might live.
14	uW1	A newborn babe could never hope\nto match that expression of horror.
15	uW1	Only the march of time can crystallize\nthose grimaces of wrath, and agony...
16	uW1	Aged to perfection, like a fine wine.
17	L	...!
18	6	They're coming our way too!
19	3	Heh. Never a dull moment around here...
20	uW1	Come now, Junebug, chin up.\nI want to see you at the peak of your\nbrilliance!
21	L	Nggh...
22	uW1	I can't savor your emotions if you\ndon't ripen to your fullest now, can I?
evt/tq/msg_tq012005f.json
0	Wd1	Sparks! They got Rowland!\nSomebody go and help the poor soul!
1	_c1	How in the... Are we snuffed then?\nIs this it for us?
2	L	Stay calm.\nThere's still a glimmer of hope.
3	L	There aren't as many monsters\nas before!
4	L	It's doable. Keep pushing them back!
5	1	We'll try!
6	uW1	Ouroberries are a force to be reckoned\nwith, aren't they? I hadn't factored them\nin, but I did get a taste of fear and despair.
7	uW1	And for that I'm truly grateful.
8	uW1	You must have felt such sweet relief when\nthey broke the Flame Clock. How does it\nfeel to have all that taken away from you?
9	uW1	You'd better pick up the pace, or my\nlittle monsters will flock to you like a\nfree meal!
10	4	It's the smoke... Put out the fire!\nStop the smoke!
11	uW1	Oh, I think it's a little late for that.
12	4	I had my doubts, but I never thought you\nwere so brazen as to do this openly...
13	uW1	When you crush and burn those plants,\nthey make the most irresistible aroma for\nmonsters.
14	3	So you lied about getting rid of them!
15	uW1	I said that nuisances had to be removed.\nWho said anything about monsters?
16	uW1	I was hoping to remove everyone,\nsave little Junebug here, and make way\nfor new growth in the forest.
17	3	...You don't half spout a load of shite,\nyou know that?
18	uW1	I *was* hoping to see them savaged by\nhungry beasts, but oh well.
19	uW1	Your efforts have managed to ruin\na perfectly good tragedy. Again.
20	4	Again?
21	uW1	Did I not mention?
22	uW1	Not a few days ago, I recall\nthat you intervened.
23	uW1	I was hoping to cull some fruitlings\nbefore their Homecoming.
24	L	Ah...! The monsters from before...!
25	uW1	Yes. I led them there myself.
26	uW1	If they had feasted on your husks,\nI could have thrown them into the\ncolony and given you such a fright!
27	L	Why... Why would you think\nof doing such an awful thing?!
28	uW1	I took you to be smarter than this,\nJunebug. Be a dear and fire up those\nsynapses for me.
29	uW1	Colony Tau was ready to accept their fate.\nI settled on the monsters as the best way\nto deal with that.
30	uW1	I thought perhaps if you were to see your\nfriends torn apart before your very eyes, it\nmight give you the...the stimulus you need.
31	2	You're beyond help...
32	uW1	When the Flame Clock was destroyed,\nand you were given the chance to live...
33	uW1	...you also came to fear death\nand gained the ability to suffer,\nas you are doing right now.
34	uW1	You've done well, my little Ouroberries.
35	uW1	Yes, indeed. The look on your faces\nis not something so easily reproduced!
36	uW1	Ahh, how long I've waited just\nto see those contortions!
37	uW1	The perfect moment... Once matured,\nthen savored... I'll not let you die easily,\nI shall see to that!
38	1	You Consuls are all the same,\naren't you?
39	1	How can you toy with people's lives\nlike this? You think this is fun?
40	uW1	Oh, I just love teasing my favorite\nplaythings. Is that really so difficult\nto understand?
41	uW1	Well, it's been lovely talking to you,\nbut I'm afraid time's getting on.
42	uW1	If you despise me so much, slay my little\npets and try taking me on yourselves.
43	uW1	Yes, that's it! That's the way!\nIt's the monsters that you encountered\non that fateful day. The very same!

1	uW1	My, you really defeated them? All of\nthem? Well, you're nothing if not tenacious.
2	L	If you stay away from our colony without\ninterfering, just as you always have...
3	L	I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.
4	uW1	Without interfering?
5	uW1	You really are a model child,\naren't you? I told you, I consider\nmyself the assiduous type.
6	uW1	Why, do you think, that so few make it to\nHomecoming in this pit that none know about\nor care about?
7	uW1	Why, do you think, there are few threats\nto your colony, yet your Flame Clock\nteeters on the brink of collapse?
8	L	I... Well...
9	uW1	Let me explain it to you in simple terms\nthat even you will be able to understand.
10	uW1	I made it that way.\nIt was by my design.
11	L	What?!
12	5	You really are the lowest of the low!
13	uW1	I had the soldiers die when approaching\ntheir final term, I conceived your peculiar\ntraditions, and I sent monsters to you.
14	uW1	And when your numbers were culled just\nenough to maintain the colony, I sent you\nnew recruits.
15	uW1	When you lacked a source of life with\nwhich to fill the Clock, I placed monsters\nof adequate strength for your succor.
16	uW1	And it has all been for this moment.\nAh, the lengths I went to just for today!
17	L	I cannot begin to understand you...
18	uW1	Countless hours of painstaking effort went\ninto this, but I am so very glad to have\nmet a soul like yourself, little Junebug.
19	uW1	Even your rage brings me delight!\nThe fact that you want to kill me where\nI stand, even more rapturous!
20	uW1	I shall contort your face into an expression\nof pure agony. I shall tear down all that\nyou are!
21	1	The people of Colony Tau have been\nfighting just to survive day to day!
22	1	We won't allow you to have your way\nany more. This ends here!
23	uW1	Yes... Yes, I suppose you're right.\nMy actions are unforgivable.
24	uW1	Come, then.\nDo your worst.
25	uW1	If you don't kill me now...
26	vW1	You'll have to watch as I\nslaughter your precious Colony Tau\nbefore your very eyes!

3	uW1	Oh, yes...\nNow that right there is the face I wanted to see...
4	uW1	I'm afraid...I won't be dying here alone.
5	uW1	I'm going to kill off all your dear,\nsweet friends one by one!
6	uW1	You will remember exactly how they died,
7	uW1	and you will regret it every waking moment,
8	uW1	cursing your own ineptitude, wishing you'd done more...
9	uW1	Avenged though they were,
10	uW1	aimless anger will consume you.
11	uW1	How very...
12	uW1	exquisite the look on your face will be then.
13	5	She's lost the plot, big time!
14	4	This was our victory.\nYou don't need to listen to this.
15	L	Colony Tau...
16	1	What about them?
17	L	We made a promise that we'd survive.
18	L	And so...
19	L	The Consul's twisted games...\nare something I cannot entertain.
20	uW1	[ML:undisp ](adlib, U being stabbed)
21	uW1	Ahh...
22	uW1	Junebug...\nSo you really can make...a face like that too.
23	L	And now I must wonder...\nDid I do the right thing, in the end?
24	1	I think that...
25	1	that's what life is all about.\nSearching to find that answer.
26	L	Yes... How true...

3	L	...
4	2	Juniper? What's wrong?

6	L	Just when I'd stopped waiting for death\nand begun to live for myself...
7	L	Why must it be so hard?
8	L	It's just as the Consul said. Expecting\ndeath would have been so much easier...
9	2	You're not wrong.\nIt's not easy, and it never will be.
10	3	Sure, but it's still a sight better than\ndoing spark all and giving up!
11	L	That's also true. You're right.
12	L	Life is a struggle, but I think I'd like to go\non fighting, for a little while longer at least.
13	5	Nah, you've gotta dream bigger.\nFight until the bitter end!
14	L	Hah. Perhaps I should.
15	L	Even without a Consul,\nour goal remains the same.
16	_c1	That's right. And we've gotta start\nby harvesting the crops.
17	L	Right, yes. We have our hands full\nas it is trying to look after ourselves\nright now.

3	M	Our lives can shine like gold,\nbut scatter them to the wind\nand they still end up like this.
4	M	In spite of that, people are drawn to\nhonor and glory... Like moths to a flame.
5	M	I wonder why.
6	5	Um. I hope you're not looking\nto me for an answer...
7	4	Perhaps it's just human nature...?
8	M	Perhaps... Though if that's true,\nthen there's no saving us.
9	M	We couldn't possibly hope to\nescape the lure, destined to be\ncaught in the fire, and die.
10	3	Thanks for that pep talk.\nSo. What are you trying to say?
11	M	I'm saying that's really not how I\nwanna go.
12	M	...Oops, I'm getting a call.\nWon't be a minute.
13	fe10600	This is Zoren from Colony 11. Come in.
14	M0300	Yes, hello, this is Ashera from Colony 11.\nYou'll have to call back, I'm busy.
15	fe10400	Hmph, seriously, Ashera?\nAnd here I thought I'd give you\nsome good news.
16	M0300	Oho? Something's got you in a good mood,\nZor. Guess I will make time for you, then.
17	1	Don't ask why...\nBut I don't think we're gonna like this.
18	2	Yeah... Agreed.
19	fe10400	A short while ago, Colony 11 received\na declaration of war.
20	M0300	Is that all? Come on. What else is new?\nYou know as well as I do, we get those\nalmost every other day...
21	fe10400	What if I tell you it's from someone\nyou've been just itching to see again?\n...Need a clue?
22	M0300	(gasp) Are you serious? She's back...
23	5	So? Don't keep us in the dark.
24	M	Heheheh... Time to rejoice, comrades!
25	M	A certain Madam Consul has finally\ndeigned to pay a visit, hoping to get\nher revenge!
26	5	Wha...! That freak's\nseriously come back?
27	4	She did strike me as the vindictive type...
28	M	Allllll righty. So, Colony 11's in\ngreat danger. We have to head over\nand provide aid.
29	3	Ugh, what rubbish. If you wanna\ngo on another rampage just say so!
30	M	Hahaha, good old Eunie!\nA typically astute observation.
31	3	(sigh) Listen. Just finish the job this\ntime, OK? No cutting her loose, please.
32	M	I read you.\nThis time I'll put her down, I promise.
33	fe10400	If you're finished deliberating,\nwhere are you now?
34	M0300	Let's see... The Fornis region,\nnear the Old Kana Battlefield.
35	fe10400	Ah! That's convenient. Approach from\nthe Maktha Wildwood side.
36	fe10400	We'll head out from Colony 11, catch\nthem in a pincer and crush them in one\nfell swoop.
37	M0300	Oh, nice! Let's do that, it sounds fun.
38	M0300	Oh, and leave the leader's head\non her shoulders. I just promised\nI'd come to collect it.
39	fe10800	Hmph, I can't guarantee that.\nJust make sure you're not delayed\nhaving some extra "fun".

5	3	Bzzt! Nope! Not doing that.
6	M	That was a joke, dear.\nFor now we can rendezvous\nwith Colony 11's main force.
7	M	We'll follow Zor's plan - push for\nthe bridge and catch the baddies\nin a pincer. All right?
8	1	Yeah... Roger that.
9	5	You're starting to sound awfully normal...

2	6	No way...\nWe gotta beat 'em again?!
3	fe1	R's little trick at work.\nThey keep popping back up,\nno matter what we do.

9	fe1	What's the plan?

4	M	Well, well, well! Madam Consul.\nYou look in good health.
5	wW1	I'm very well, thank you. How about\nyourself, you filthy animal? You're looking\na tad rough, if you don't mind me saying.
6	M	Ah, we're a little tied up here.\nWould you mind making this quick?
7	wW1	Oh, enough of these exhausting charades...\nI don't think you understand the gravity of\nyour situation.
8	wW1	If I were to order my army to fall upon\nyou, as Antols on a fresh carcass, what do\nyou think would happen...? Shall we see?
9	4	If you wanted to do that, you\ncould have done it from the start.\nYou obviously want something.
10	wW1	Indeed. And so, to the matter at hand.\nFoul and wicked traitors, listen to me well.
11	wW1	Accept my demand, and I shall order\nmy troops to withdraw this instant.
12	M	Oh?
13	1	You'd pull back your troops?\nIn this situation...?
14	3	Hah, I'm sure Her Worshipfulness\nwould love nothing more than to\n"show us mercy"... Yeugh.
15	wW1	Wrong. I know a better way to\nsettle things. One that won't leave\nbehind any grudges.
16	wW1	Former Commander Ashera,\nand you, mutinous Ouroboros whelps.
17	wW1	I challenge you...to a duel!
18	M	Errr... Excuse me?
19	3	A duel? What, is that like a skirmish?
20	wW1	You ignoramuses... Ah, but no.\nI suppose it's only natural you\nwouldn't know.
21	wW1	A duel is a concept from the\nbygone world. Call it a specific\nmethod of waging warfare.
22	wW1	You and I will battle under\na strict set of rules, in order to\nsettle matters once and for all...
23	wW1	The winner of the duel will\ndetermine how this war ends.
24	1	So then, you're saying we can finish this\nthing right now, by ourselves?
25	4	This is nonsense! What would\nyou stand to gain from this?
26	wW1	A duel is staked upon one's honor,\nnot one's life. Trivial things such as\ngain or loss have no bearing here.
27	wW1	Ashera! With this duel, I will erase\nthe shame you inflicted, and restore\nmy due dignity!
28	M	Hmm.
29	wW1	I think you understand.\nNow give me your answer.
30	M	I'm just making sure, but...what if I refuse?
31	wW1	Then the war is back on. My invincible\narmy will crush your whole colony,\nand you along with it.
32	wW1	Of course, the same will happen\nif you renege on your word.
33	M	...OK, agreed.\nI'll accept your "duel", or what-have-you...
34	wW1	Most wise. You always were quick\non the uptake, I must say.
35	M	Huh, thanks. So what happens now?\nIf we're going to have it out right\nnow, then...
36	wW1	Don't be so hasty. I will send you\nan invitation with the location of this duel.\nFor now, I shall withdraw my forces.
37	5	Huh? Do we need all this beatin'\nabout the bush? Why not just tell us\nwhere it is now?
38	wW1	Hold your insolent tongue!\nI told you, these things have rules.
39	wW1	This is a formal engagement, and as such\nthere are procedures to follow.
40	M	Before you go - a question.
41	M	Those troops behind you that you're so\nproud of... What in the world have you\ndone to them?
42	wW1	I'm under no obligation to tell you.\nTruly it has nothing to do with you.
43	wW1	More importantly, this will be our final\nbattle. You would do well to prepare\nyourself.
44	6	Um, anyway...\nDoes this mean we made it?
45	3	Looks that way.\nNot what I'd call satisfying, though.
46	1	Ashera, what will you do?
47	M	Oh, I'm sure I'll think of something.
48	M	Hm. For now we'll go back to Colony 11\nand wait for this invitation.

1	fe1	It appears we've pulled through...for the\nmoment at least. However...it's certainly a\nstrange turn of events.
2	1	True. R's withdrawn her troops.\nBut I'm still uneasy... Everything's\ngoing exactly how she planned it.
3	3	And what were those soldiers,\nfor Queen's sake? I thought I was\ngoin' crazy!
4	ge1	Fighting them one-on-one, you might\nas well be fighting a doll. But the\nnumbers... They just wouldn't die.
5	2	...No. It's not that they won't die. I think\nfrom the start, they never had life in them\nat all...
6	1	If Moebius can do something like that,\nhow come they haven't used it before?
7	4	Whatever R's plan is, if we're forced into\na war of attrition, we stand absolutely\nno chance.
8	4	Ashera knows this. That's why she's\naccepted R's terms... Conceivably.
9	3	You reckon? I think she just did her usual,\njust doin' anythin' to see if it's fun.
10	3	Well? What're our chances\nof winning, Ashe-
11	3	Uh...
12	1	Ashera?
13	fe1	I...don't think she was here in the\nfirst place?
14	3	What the...? Did she just up and\ndisappear on us again?! I'm losing\nmy patience with her!
15	6	I'm pretty sure she wouldn't have\nleft the colony...
16	1	Say, do you know where she's gone?
17	fe1	No.
18	ge1	No clue.
19	he1	...
20	3	Queen's spleen, I hate that maniac...
evt/tq/msg_tq012108f.json
0	M	Ugh...!
evt/tq/msg_tq012110f.json
0	M	Nggh...
1	3	Ashera!
2	M	Ah! Eunie?
3	3	Ugh, don't tell me I have to look\nafter you too? You've caused enough\ntrouble for us, don't give me any more!
4	3	Hm? Hey. You all right?
5	M	Wh-what do you mean?
6	3	Wha-\nYou're looking awful. Are you feelin' OK?
7	M	N-no... I'm fine. Just great.
8	3	Well, I sure hope so.\nWe've still got R's stupid duel thing.\nYou better keep it together.
9	M	Uhh... Sorry. I suppose I'm\nnot feeling too great.
10	3	Don't just lie about it then! Queen's sake!\nYou're the one who said you'd beat R.
11	M	I mean, yes. That I did.\nIt's just...I can't get into this.
12	M	To me, this duel rubbish just sounds like\nplaying at war. It's not the battle I'm after.
13	3	This again... Then why did you\nagree to what she wants?
14	M	Why? Well, I don't mind dying myself, but\nthat doesn't mean I'm fine dragging you all\ndown with me.
15	3	Oh, you're too kind. Let me\nremind you though, we wouldn't\nbe in this mess if it weren't for you!
16	M	Ahaha... I might have made a serious\nmiscalculation, I'm ashamed to say.
17	3	...
18	3	Hey. There's something\nI've wanted to ask you.
19	3	Ashera... What do you really want?
20	M	How do you mean...?
21	3	It's just... What is this "battle" you're\nlooking for, ultimately? What will it\ntake for you to be satisfied?
22	3	If all these meaningless fights aren't it,\nthen why not just say it straight?
23	M	...
24	3	What? What is it? You're just staring at me.
25	M	Eunie.
26	3	Y-yeah?
27	M	This is just hypothetical.
28	M	But if I asked you, here and now,\nto kill me... Do you think you would?
29	3	You what?!\nAre you for snuffin' real?
30	3	You're telling that same tired joke?\nOr maybe you really have lost your mind!
31	M	...
32	3	D-don't just clam up, say something!
33	3	Huh? A message...?
34	M	Oh dear. That'll be a summons from\nour favorite lady Consul.
35	3	This is...a set of coordinates?\nWait, this points to...
36	3	These are right below Keves Castle!\nIs this some kind of mistake?
37	M	Hm, I wonder...\nI suppose we'll know when we get there.
38	M	Well, we'd better make tracks.\nIf the job's a bad one, it's best to\nget it over with all snappy-like.
39	3	Ah! Oi, wait!
40	M	Oh yes, what I was saying before...\nIt was just a joke, like you said.\nDon't pay it any mind.

0		I can't believe it.
1		Who knew there was a place\nlike this beneath the Castle?
2		There's nothing here at all...
3		Right... But, ugh, what's going on?
4		It feels like...the skin on the back of my neck's crawlin'...
5		This place... It's...
6		[ML:undisp ](pained grunt)
7		Ashera? What's up?
8		It's, ah... It's nothing.
9		Nothing at all.
10		Welcome to the bottom of the world.\nI've been waiting for you.
11		Yeah! I'm finally here.
12		What's the next step, self-introductions?
13		Or maybe...
14		we can just get down to the killing.
15		Hmph. No need to be so impatient.
16		After all, this might be the last time we two\nwill get to clash with one another.
17		Hmph. And does it say anywhere in your rules...\nthat we have to chew the fat down in the arse-end of nowhere?
18		R. Do you think I'm playing around?
19		Don't get so bent out of shape.
20		Is this place not to your liking?
21		Observe. I've prepared this very special\nstage, for our very special battle.
22		I can't think of a more appropriate place for our duel than this,\nthe "ass-end of nowhere" as you so aptly put it.
23		Ah!
24		What's wrong?
25		You're very quiet. At this point you'd usually have\nsomething glib to say. This isn't like you, my dear.
26		Ahh, could it be...
27		your "neck injury" is troubling you?\nSomething along those lines, perhaps?
28		You and I... We've met "before"?
29		Incorrect. This is, in fact, the first time.
30		However...I know what it is you remember.
31		I know...everything...about...you.
32		Didn't I say before?
33		There's nowhere more appropriate for our...duel.
34		Ngh...
35		Don't tell me. Did you truly think that you could hide it?\nYou didn't think we'd know?
36		H-hey! The spark is she blabbing on about here?
37		Oh, come on now.\nYou haven't even told your friends, Ashera?
38		Hmm, well I suppose you couldn't have. Right?
39		You're a coward.
40		Ashera!
41		Wh-what the spark?!
42		Wh-when did they-?!
43		[ML:undisp ](beginning to laugh)
44		Ahahahahaha!
45		I got you there! You imbecile!
46		No, Ashera! You've gotta hang in there!
47		No way... Ashera's...!
48		Expertly done, W!
49		Everything is going exactly as I'd planned!
50		Can play...with doll?
51		Oh, yes! Be my guest! Play with your little doll\nto your heart's content!
52		Yay!
53		So that was it. Those soldiers weren't R's doing at all.
54		They were being controlled\nby this other Consul instead!
55		That bitch! This is what she wanted all along!
56		And we fell for it! Duel, my arse!
57		Actually, that's where you're wrong.
58		What follows next will be a duel,\nplainly and unmistakably.
59		Only, your opponent might be a little...
60		closer to home! Bwahahahaha!
evt/tq/msg_tq012112.json
0		Not good... At this rate...
1		If we hold back, she'll wipe the floor with us.\nBut we can't-
2		Snuff, what do we do?!
3		Hahahaha! Excellent! Marvelous!
4		Each move so steady, so precise, so certain!
5		Oh, I do love a good game of chess!
6		I knew it would be worth the trouble I went to,\nputting this glorious stage together!
7		...Kill?
8		Not yet! Play with them a little more!
9		This appetizer isn't nearly enough to satisfy me!
10		Play...
11		Oh?
12		E...Eunie!\nWh...what do you think you're doing?!
13		Hey, Ashera. What was it you told me?
14		Something about there being no friends or foes\nwhen fighting each other to the death, or whatever.
15		That's why, I just had to take that shot.
16		You should be happy with that, right?!
17		Oho! Now this is unexpected!\nCaught a taste of her lust for battle, have you?
18		Belt up! You just shut your ugly trap!
19		What?!
20		Hey! You're satisfied with that, right?
21		So come on... Wake the spark up, right now!
22		There's no snuffin' way this is\nthe death you were looking for!
23		Am I wrong, Ashera?
24		No, no, you're not wrong.
25		But anyone else would be dead right now,
26		you fool.
27		Ashera!
28		Gah...
29		Been a real while, since I took a hit like that...
30		But, I owe you one.
31		I'm back, and I've never felt more alive!
32		Damn it!
33		W! What are you playing at?!
34		Seize her again!
35		I can't. She put up barriers around her psyche.
36		Anything more than a lifeless husk\nand it's too hard.
37		Cease your bellyaching and do it!
38		Just do it now! Do it do it do it!!!
39		I told you, I can't.
40		W!
41		I've come too far for you to muck this up now!
42		Oh dear, oh dear!
43		Having a fall out?\nIs this part of your duel's rules too?
44		Shut up! I'll tell you what I think of our shitting duel!
45		If I just murder the lot of you here,\nthen it's all the same to me!
46		W! Bring out all the husks we have!
47		And don't even think about abstaining yourself!
48		Okaaay...
49		Ashera!\nDon't forget - remember what you promised!
50		Uh-huh. I remember!
51		How about we end this once and for all!

1	M	That brings our business to a close,\nMadam Consul. Any last words?
2	xW1	Yes, gloat! Maniac! I hope you lose your\nmind, writhe in agony...
3	xW1	You can run from your "pain" all you want,\nit'll only happen again!
4	xW1	No matter how much you fight...\nNo matter how many lives you take...
5	xW1	Ahaha! Hahaha! Ahahahahaha!!!
6	M	Even if it works out the same,
7	M	I have to fight against it...\nThis pain... However many times.
8	3	...
evt/tq/msg_tq012114f.json
0	M	The look on your face tells me\nyou want to ask something.
1	3	You...knew about all this from the start?
2	3	About Moebius, about how the people\nof this world are born, all that...
3	3	Since before you even met us... All along...
4	M	Can I...tell you a story?
5	3	...
6	M	It's from a ridiculously long time ago,\na time all but gone from memory.
7	M	Today soldiers fight and scrabble to\nsurvive for ten years, all to be blessed\nwith the honor of the Homecoming ritual...
8	M	But once, there was a time when there\nwas no such thing as a Homecoming ritual.
9	3	You what?\nI've never heard this before.
10	M	I did just say.\nIt's all but gone from memory.
11	M	Even so, there was a ceremony for those\nsoldiers who reached Homecoming age.\nDo you know what would happen?
12	M	A Consul would end them personally.\nNo off-seers to be seen. In other words...
13	M	...an execution.
14	3	Wha... Execution...\nWhat the spark for?!
15	M	It sounds better if you call it a ceremony\nto offer up the light of a person's life...
16	M	But really, all that awaited them was a\ndeath much more humiliating than if they'd\nfallen to an enemy's Blade.
17	3	But...that doesn't make any sense!\nAnd why do you know any of this?
18	3	(gasp) Wait... No way...\nYou don't mean...
19	M	...This scar on my neck.\nI didn't always have this, you know.
20	M	It starts appearing as I get older...\nAlong with memories of that day...\nand the pain.
21	M	Each time, I remember thinking one thing.\n"This isn't how it's supposed to be."
22	M	"I didn't go through all this fighting\nfor it to end like this."
23	3	...
24	M	And another lovely gift - the pain\nkeeps getting worse and worse.
25	M	It'll become unbearable as Homecoming\nnears...until finally I go mad from the pain,\nand then...
26	3	I didn't... How many times have you had\nto go through this? Do you know?
27	M	...Eunie. I know to you it must've\nseemed like I just spout nonsense\nand try to look cool...
28	M	But really... I just want to escape.\nEscape the feeling that death is wrapped\naround my throat, ready to take me.
29	M	So there you have it. All I want is to die\nin the time and place that *I* choose.
30	M	That's basically it.\nMaybe I really am just a coward.
31	3	Ashera...
32	3	Well, now I get why you\nasked me if I'd kill you.
33	M	Heh. You must've thought I was a fool.\nBut you see, Eunie...
34	M	It would mean more to me...\nMuch more than any of the deaths\nI've gone through until now.
35	3	...I'll do it.\nNo need to convince me any further.
36	M	Thank you. This way I can finally\nmove on without any regrets.
37	3	However, under one condition.
38	3	If I'm gonna kill you...
39	3	I go too. You gotta take me with you.
40	M	...Huh? Erm... Sorry...?\nRun that past me again...?
41	3	Argh, just forget it, shut up!\nI know I'm sounding like an idiot.
42	3	But...guess there's no helping that.
43	3	You're... I've sort of realized you're\nthe same as me.
44	M	I'm the same as you...?
45	3	So you won't hear any crap like,\n"you gotta tough it out, you gotta live on"...
46	3	...or "anything's better than dying".\nNot from me, of all people.
47	M	...
48	3	I'd just rather...help you find the right\nplace where you can end things.
49	3	And if I mess that up...\nI'll just have to kick your bucket myself.
50	3	But you've gotta do the same for me.\nAnd I'm not takin' no for an answer. Deal?
51	M	Eunie... Do you remember...?
52	3	But, Ashera...
53	3	Both of our lives...\nThey don't belong to just us, you know.
54		
55	M	Ahahaha, you've got me there...
56	M	You put me in a bind...\nGuess I can't go dying just yet.

1	N	Ahoy, laddie! There's somewhere I be\nwantin' to go to.
2	4	...I am not "laddie", and I'm under no\nobligation whatsoever to listen to you.
3	N	Actually, there's a bunch o' places\nI need to pay a visit to.
4	4	You can talk to yourself all you want.\nWe don't have the time to listen to you\ndrone on.
5	N	It was on a cold day,\nnearly a hundred years ago.
6	4	Hey, don't just ignore me when I'm\ntalking to you!
7	N	I was on a journey at the time,\nseeking strong foes.
8	5	What, like you're doing now, you mean?
9	3	Don't encourage him.
10	N	One day, I ran into...him.
11	2	Him?
12	N	Aye, him. An eccentric man was he.\nCouldn't fight his way out of a paper bag.
13	N	But then, he ended up entrustin' somethin'\nimportant to me.
14	1	I see... But if this was so long ago, then...\nThat man must be...
15	N	Anyone's life is short if you look at it\nfrom my perspective. Not that I be tryin'\nto offend ye folks.
16	N	Anyway, this man, he handed me a...\nI think it was a...pot? After that I can't\nremember a blessed thing.
17	4	You think? You can't remember?\nWhat are we supposed to do with that?
18	6	Um... So what does this have to do\nwith where you wanna go?
19	N	Very good question, girl!
20	N	It came to me suddenly that when he and\nI went places, I'd leave some kinda mark.
21	N	I mean, it'd be a bother if I forgot where\nwe went, eh? So I left my giant handprints\nall over the place.
22	5	"All over the place", huh?\nVery helpful.
23	N	Well, now and then stuff comes back to\nme. I just remembered I left one mark by\na lake around where Gamma is right now.
24	1	Does the place stand out?
25	N	Ahh... Sorry, can't remember anything\nexcept that mark.
26	N	Back then I used to fly everywhere\nin a Ferronis.
27	4	You used a Ferronis just for that?\nWhat the... What a waste!
28	N	I suppose. It did cause a few squabbles\nwith some other colonies. Haha!
29	1	Forget about that.\nAt least we've got something to aim for.
30	4	B-but...!
31	1	Of course, we can't just run around\nendlessly hunting for those marks.
32	1	But if we see something similar to what\nhe remembers, it might jolt his memory.
33	4	...Then I suppose I don't mind.
34	N	Sorry, folks. Just keep your eyes\npeeled for 'em, and I'll be grateful.
evt/tq/msg_tq012201f.json
0	3	Is this...
1	N	Yarrr! Thar it be! That be my handprint and\nno mistake! As big as a whale, as always!
2	4	Does that jog your memory?
3	N	Aye... My friend and I used to go off\nhuntin' a lot. I'm sure it was in, uh...
4	4	That phrasing is very telling.
5	N	He would keep this thingy\non him that he used to treasure...
6	N	But blow me down if I can't remember\nwhat that thingy might be!
7	2	Well, is there anything else\nyou can think of?
8	N	I only traveled with him for a short time,\nI did. Seems like I only have to blink and\nanother human passes away.
9	6	You managed to remember this\nmuch about him. Otherwise we\nwouldn't be here!
10	N	I wonder...
11	1	I probably should have asked before,\nbut what even made you remember\nsomething from that long ago?
12	N	Ah, well. It was while I watched our fair\nNopon lady cookin' up a storm.
13	N	And it just popped into my head.\nI felt...dissatisfied, like somethin' was\nmissin'.
14	9	Food of Manana not nummy?
15	N	Nay, nothin' like that, Miss.\nI love just about anythin' I eat.
16	N	Ah, that's stirred somethin'... Day after\nday, he'd peek inside his little pot thing.
17	N	Ahh...it's come back to me!\nWe were broadsided by a Ropl, and my\nmate brought out his pot.
18	N	He murmured somethin' or\nother about "fermentation".
19	5	Fermentation? What's up with that?\nWas it some science experiment or\nsomething?
20	3	Queen's wings, what is in this pot?
21	3	Uh?!\nIsn't that a Ropl right now?!
22	1	On your guard, guys!
evt/tq/msg_tq012202f.json
0	N	Well, stick me with spines and call me a\nSpike Urchon! That monster knew how to\nput up a fight!
1	4	A fight? That was awful!\nHow the spark did you forget about that?!
2	5	Look, whatever, it's done.\nJust tell us you found what\nyou're looking for.
3	N	Well, I remembered one thing.
4	3	See, there we go!\nReminisce away, old timer!
5	N	Long ago, when there was no\nColony Gamma here...
6	N	Back then...\nIt was Colony Iota and Colony 18,\nwho were at each others' throats.
7	N	'Course, in I blundered, with no clue at\nall, and I ended up with both of 'em tryin'\nto send me into the deep!
8	3	Yeah, when I said reminisce, I meant about\nsomething relevant, yeah?
9	N	They had some guts, tryin' to off a\nConsul, that be sure. Back then, just about\nanybody tried to have a pop at ol' Triton!
10	3	Right, I'm punching him.\nNoah, permission to punch!
11	1	H-hold on until after he's done.
12	N	While we were fleein' the colonies,\nwe made a little meal of the monster\nwe killed here.
13	N	Quite a good cook, was my mate.
14	N	Sorry, kiddies. Looks like\nthere's nothin' here.
15	5	Come on, we can't end it like this.
16	N	Well, I reckon...\nIt might be round where Lambda is now.
17	5	Then let's get over there!\nYou might remember something else.
evt/tq/msg_tq012203f.json
0	N	Arrr, I see nothin's changed\nabout this place!
1	4	But didn't you insinuate Colony Lambda\nhasn't always been stationed here?
2	N	Aye, that's right. That place be great if you\nwant a good solid defense, but woe betide\nye if ye try launchin' an attack from it.
3	N	You had to fight like a trooper back in\nthe day, so there was no point in havin'\na stationary base.
4	N	If their commander's holed up inside,\nthey're either very sure of themselves,\nor they're one ship short of a full fleet.
5	N	By the by, see that big hole opened up\nnear the Ferronis?
6	4	Oh, that. Seems it's been there\nfor some time.
7	N	I bashed that one open, with these\nhere fists.
8	2	Huh? You did that?
9	N	Well, this is the kind of place my mate\nused to like to fish.
10	N	And if he couldn't fish, I couldn't eat.\nI'd just sit on my arse.
11	N	Well, I had time to kill, so I'd smash\nchunks out of the cliff face every day.
12	N	What man sees a wall and doesn't want\nto tear it down, I ask you?
13	6	I dunno what walls you've seen, buddy.
14	4	So, Triton?\nDoes that remind you of anything?
15	N	Hmmmm...
16	N	He were such an easygoing fella...\nBut I never once asked him where\nhe came from, or how old he was.
17	N	Now I come to think of it,\nI didn't even know wherefore\nhe was travelin'...
18	2	You didn't check him with your Iris?
19	N	I wonder...\nIt was all so long ago, I don't remember...
20	N	Ahh, but! I know that when he and I\narrived here it was quite a balmy day.
21	N	He peeked inside his pot, said that all\nthe heat wouldn't do, then spoke about\nhow he wanted to wait out the season...
22	1	What could that mean?
23	N	That's the thing about livin' as long as\nI have. I know it's important, but I just\nplum forgot, and it ain't comin' back...
24	5	Mate...
25	N	My memory's not what it used to be,\nbut I do recall Rhoguls used to hang\nout here.
26	N	We were once surrounded by them,\nI faintly recall. That was a hard battle,\nindeed.
27	4	Do you mean...like those things?
28	5	Argh! This just keeps happening!
29	N	Hah! What be life without a bit of\nexcitement? We can vent by beatin'\nthe tar out of 'em!
30	5	You know what? Fine.\nLet's do it!
evt/tq/msg_tq012204f.json
0	3	I don't wanna sound like Taion,\nbut I'll say it anyway - this is\nall your fault!
1	N	Ah, sorry, girly. Why don't I catch you\na nice whopper to say I'm sorry?
2	N	I'll roast it nicely and serve it up to you.\nIt'll taste mighty fine, I promise!
3	3	Anyway, we're not getting any\nmore clues from your memory.
4	2	I guess it can't be helped? It's\nsuch a long time ago, after all.
5	4	First hunting, then fishing...\nWhat are we even doing here, seriously?
6	N	I'm gettin' fed up runnin' about\nlike a headless Tirkin...
7	4	Oh, you're fed up?!
8	1	Triton, you said the pot was dropped\nsomewhere, didn't you?
9	1	If it was so long ago, who's to say that\nsomeone didn't pick it up?
10	N	Oh. I didn't think of that.\nGuess it ain't impossible...
11	6	Maybe so much time has passed that\nit got buried or something?
12	4	So now I suppose you\nwant us to start digging...
13	6	I'm just saying, is all!
14	5	Can you really not think of anything else?
15	N	Erm...\nOh! There might be one thing.
16	N	Behind Keves Castle be those hoverin'\nreefs, aye? They be triggerin' my noggin...
17	5	There must be something there then.\nLet's go.
18	N	Hey now, boyo. What's got into you\nall of a sudden?
19	5	Nothing much. I just think if this place\nis important to you, we should pay it\na visit.
evt/tq/msg_tq012205f.json
0	N	Nothin'.\nGuess I wasted your time again.
1	2	It really was a long while ago, huh?\nMaybe there's nothing we can do...
2	N	Aye, this place was already in a sorry\nstate way-back-when. Must've been\nblasted off to who knows where.
3	6	By the way... Your friend, Triton.\nHow did he die?
4	N	I don't know the why and wherefore...\nBut it'd be about the time when a beastie\nswallowed him down in one gulp.
5	6	Oh no...
6	N	He was wavin' his arms, shouting\n"Eat me!" He was a bit of a loon.
7	4	He must have been, to travel with you.\nMaybe one of those monsters bashed a\nscrew loose.
8	N	This has been nothin' but trouble for ye\nkids... If nothin' turns up here, let's just\ncall it quits, eh?
9	5	Wait, that's kinda sudden!\nYou're OK with stopping, after all this?
10	N	It ain't the searchin' that's the problem,\nI can do that whenever. I've got a bit\nmore time than ye all have...
11	1	Triton...
12	N	But you know, I have at least\nremembered my friend.
13	N	It might be my lot in life, to outlive\neveryone else... But he lives in my\nmemories, and in my heart.
14	N	Ain't no way I'd throw away\nwhat he's left me.
15	N	'Course, I forgot all about him until now,\nso I'm talkin' complete bilge.
16	4	...
17	4	If you've finished being gloomy, we need\nto search every nook and cranny. There\nmust be something we haven't seen.
18	5	You what? You were totally\nagainst all this.
19	4	I just hate leaving a job half-done.
20	4	Honestly, I couldn't care less about what\nhe's searching for...
21	4	...and I don't mind if we never find it.\nBut I just need to know...either way.
22	N	Arr, words well spoken, four-eyes.
23	N	I'm much the same.\nRight then, let's give it one more shot!
24	N	Oh, what's this?
25	N	Haha, you're still alive, you wretched cur!
26	N	Thought I'd taken care of you back then.\nThis time I'll make sure you don't get\naway. Prepare to be pounded!
evt/tq/msg_tq012206.json
0	N	Arr, goin' toe to toe with a big slugger\nlike this... There ain't nothin' finer!
1	4	Putting that aside...\nWould this be our fabled pot?
2	4	This thing was holding onto it.
3	N	Hm?
4	N	Ahh! That'll be it!\nIt's gotta be!
5	6	Yeah? Is that really the pot?
6	6	So uh...what have we got inside there?
7	1	Don't tell us you want to keep it secret,\nafter all we've been through.
8	N	Ah, well you see...
9	N	(sniff)... Hm. Hmm...
10	N	What is this?
11	5	Uhh... Don't look at me.
12	9	Oho?! Familiar smell...
13	9	It miso paste!
14	1	Uh, miso...?
15	9	That correct! Can add miso to meat, fishies,\nall sorts of vegetable... Is all-purpose flavoring!
16	2	Erm... Then, err...
17	6	What?! That's what we were busting our butts for?
18	N	Miso...
19	N	Ahhh, that's right!
20	N	Me and him, we...
21	wf1	(Arrgggh!)
22	N	Hold on! I'll have you out...
23	wf1	No, friend! Forget about me!\nOnly...
24	wf1	The pot... Only the pot matters now!
25	N	Are you out of your mind?!
26	N	You worked your behind off to make this miso stuff!
27	wf1	I'm sorry, my friend... This is it for me...
28	wf1	But I put my whole being into that...
29	wf1	I want you to take that perfect miso...
30	wf1	You need to make...
31	wf1	the best dish everrrrr!
32	N	Partneeeerrrrrr!
33	N	Whoa!
34	N	I remember now...
35	N	He and I...we journeyed to gather ingredients\nthat would match this stuff.
36	N	But...when we finally arrived here...
37	N	That blasted monster went and ate him.
38	N	And he...he entrusted this to me...
39	N	Idiot! How could I-?
40	N	How could I ever have forgotten\nsomething that damn-well important!
41	3	[ML:undisp ](small breath, worried)
42	N	I get it... When I saw the Nopon lady cookin' and\nthought somethin' was missin' from the food...
43	N	That thing, it was miso.
44	5	Huh...
45	N	To think that...all these years and decades,\nmy heart's been captive to a simple bean paste.
46	N	Doesn't that sound stupid? Eh?
47	6	Uhh... Urm... Ahhah...?
48	N	I'm sorry about this, kiddies.
49	N	This miso won't ever go off, even if centuries pass.
50	N	If you behave, I'll treat ye to a little taste!
51	9	That make Manana incredibly happy!\nLooking forward to sampling legendary miso!
52	3	Hey, Noah?
53	1	...What's up?
54	3	Gonna ask you again. Can I give him a real slug?
55	1	...Just one.

1	zf1	So, the other day, right?\nMiki was like-
2	Xg1	Heyyyyy!\nHold on, you can't tell her that!
3	O	Tell me, tell me!
4	xf1	Ah! She's here!
5	xf1	Sorry, Fifi!\nI'll just borrow you for one sec...
6	Wg1	Hmm...
7	xf1	It's about the flowers for Irma...
8	xf1	People keep asking why we\ndon't plant the seeds.
9	xf1	We've been kinda brushing it off,\nsaying it's been tough for you, but...\nWe're gonna have to do something.
10	ag1	Ah...!
11	O	Right... Um...
12	xf1	Don't feel like you have to rush\nanything. If you're still working\nthrough your feelings...
13	Xg1	Hey... Dontcha guys think Tallow and\nFifi have been reeeally close lately?
14	Xg1	I feel like they've been\ntalking alone a bunch.
15	xf1	I, uh, I think you're imagining it!
16	Xg1	Then why are you so flustered?
17	zf1	Veeeery fishy.
18	xf1	...Errr.
19	O	No, really, it's nothing!\nI'm just...
20	Wg1	You've been more distant,\never since Irma died.
21	Xg1	Aya...!
22	Wg1	To get blunt with you, everyone's\na bit concerned, OK?
23	Xg1	Yeah... We really are...
24	Wg1	We're all sad about Irma\ndying too, you know...
25	Wg1	But it's even worse seeing you\ngetting so down like this...
26	O	I'm fine, really!
27	Wg1	So why do you always dodge the issue\nevery time we bring her up? You can't\ntell me it's not on purpose.
28	O	Uh!
29	xf1	Hey, that's enough!
30	Wg1	It's not enough until I say it's enough!\nAnd anyway, we weren't talking to you.
31	Xg1	That's right, this is about Fifi.
32	zf1	Not you, Tirkinhead.
33	xf1	Why?!
34	Wg1	It's not just about Irma, either.\nWe're worried about the future\nof the colony as well...
35	Wg1	There's so much we want to discuss,\nbut you're always busy in your own head.
36	zf1	Are you sure you can't share with us...?
37	O	...I'm sorry.
38	Wg1	...I don't get it.\nWhat's going on in there, Fifi?
39	xf1	Uh...?!
40	xf1	Don't mind them, Fiona.\nThey'll come around, I'm sure.
41	5	So you're just gonna leave it like this?
42	O	If they knew the truth, it'd only\nhurt them more. And then...
43	O	Then Colony Mu would fall apart.
44	6	Maybe, but with things like this,\nyou'll be the one who's hurting.
45	O	...
46	O	I haven't decided what to do about\nthe flowers for Irma yet...
47	O	I'm going to pay a quick visit\nto the flower garden, OK?
48	6	Is she gonna be all right...?
49	4	She made a choice to protect her friends,\nbut it created distance between them...
50	4	Seems like a thankless endeavor to me.
51	1	Do you think there's anything\nwe could do, Lanz?
52	5	Well, yeah! I reckon she's forgetting\nsomething pretty important here. All\nwe gotta do is remind her.
53	5	Better get ourselves over to\nthe flower garden.
evt/tq/msg_tq012301f.json
0	O	I wanted to change so I could stay\ntogether with my friends...
1	O	But all I do is wallow in my own misery...\nI'm just not getting anywhere. I hate this...
2	O	I keep missing you, Irma...\nAnd I hate that, too...
3	5	Oi, Tirkin-bun!
4	O	...Huh?!
5	O	You-... You mean me?
6	5	Who else would I mean?
7	5	You're the dummy hurting your friends\nand yourself and then pretending not\nto notice.
8	5	It ain't like you. I thought you wanted to\nbuild a new future for Colony Mu?
9	O	I know, all right? I know things\ncan't stay like this much longer...
10	O	But...I'm just so scared.\nI don't know if I can make\nthe right choices.
11	O	I feel like I'll make some fundamental\nmistake, and it's terrifying.
12	5	Even though we're here?
13	5	If you can't figure it out yourself,\nthat's when you put your heads together\nwith others. You even think of that?
14	4	I agree with my colleague here, though\nI must point out that putting his head\nwith others may have adverse effects.
15	5	Watch it.
16	6	Hey... I know being afraid, trust me.
17	6	But a worry shared is a worry halved,\nyeah? We wanna help you, Fifi.
18	O	...Sennie, that's so nice...
19	9	If Manana can lend wing with\nanything, please say!
20	O	Manana-banana...
21	5	You don't have to wrestle\nwith everything alone.
22	5	Next time you forget your friends,\nI'm gonna call you Fiona Featherhead.
23	9	That sound cute!\nManana also want be called!
24	5	I'll have to come up with\nsomething special for you...
25	O	Everyone... Thank you.
26	O	OK, so, about the flowers for Irma...
27	ag1	Cannot grow flowers for Irma!
28	O	What was that, Goo?
29	ag1	Instead, have to bury this.\nGoogoo asked by Irma!
30	O	Huh?!
31	O	What's this...?
32	8	To Riku, look like key, maybe.\nBut also look super old...
33	O	A key...? But what does it unlock?
34	5	Hmm. Didn't you say she used to\nwander off someplace?
35	O	Ah...
36	6	So maybe this is connected somehow!
37	O	Goo, did you hear anything else?
38	ag1	Sorry, but nothing.\nIrma was woman of many secrets...
39	4	Well, in an absence of obvious\nleads, we'll just have to gather\ninformation ourselves.
40	4	If possible, we should investigate the\nErythia Relay Base. Irma was meant to\nbe in charge of this whole region...
41	4	We may come across some\nform of evidence there.
42	5	You think she left us a sign or something?
43	4	If she'd left anything, it would have been\ncamouflaged at the time. Now, however...
44	O	The effects of her power\nwon't work any more...
45	O	We might see something\nthat was hidden before!
46	8	Even without lead, should still go.
47	8	Might discover more about steps\nof Irma than Fiona knew previous.
48	5	Someone's being unusually nice.
49	8	...Lanz can fix own power frame\nfrom now on.
50	5	What? What did I say?!
51	O	Hahaha.
52	6	Aww look, you laughed!\nThat's a good start.
53	6	Let's go to Erythia Relay Base\nand check it out!
54	O	All right!
55	1	We'll look for information on the terminal\nin the data archives, like before.
evt/tq/msg_tq012302f.json
0	zi1	They're inside! Pile in!
1	6	They just keep on coming!
2	8	Hold soldiers off, and check terminal!
3	5	Good call. Go for it, Riku.
4	8	...Muh? Riku check?!
5	5	It'd save the most time.
6	8	Riku not particularly adept at...
7	9	Is OK! Manana here also!
8	8	Now Riku really worried.
9	O	You'll figure it out together!
10	O	Manana-banana is strong when it counts,\nand Rickles can keep a cool head.
11	O	Even if you're not great at something,\nyour friends can always cover your\nweakness!
12	5	Here they come...!
13	O	We'll never let them through!
evt/tq/msg_tq012303f.json
0	6	Seems like it's over... Right?
1	8	Riku and Manana also cleaned up\nover here... Somehow.
2	O	A large-scale map of Agnian territories...\nMust be strategic military information.
3	5	Sure, fancy. But how do we pinpoint\nwhere Irma might've been from this?
4	8	Please to direct complaints elsewhere.\nSecurity much too tight to crack.
5	9	It seem locked even more\ntightly than last time...
6	5	Seriously? Well, sparks...
7	4	No, hang on... How about here?
8	4	The map's showing a military installation...
9	O	Huh...?\nBut there was never anything there...
10	9	Is map wrong then?
11	O	...No. The management system\nis still functional.
12	O	There's something here.\nNo mistaking it.
13	6	Then we should definitely\ncheck it out, Fifi!
evt/tq/msg_tq012304f.json
0	O	What's this...? Irma's private data?
1	O	And here, someone else's...
2	4	It could be the settings she used\nfor her aliases.
3	4	This may have been her trying to decide\nwhat kind of person to become.
4	5	She also might've needed to disguise\nherself as someone else when dealing\nwith Keves.
5	2	Here's a list of targets for "harvesting"...
6	2	...and it seems to include Kevesi people?
7	1	She must have served as\nConsul for Keves too.
8	1	The periods when she disappeared\nmust have been times when she acted\nas a Kevesi Consul...
9	6	Fifi, how are you holding up?
10	O	...I should've known we'd find something.
11	O	So why...? Why does it hurt so much...?
12	2	...It must be really hard for you.\nYou must feel like you're getting\nknocked down, time and again.
13	2	But still, you've decided you want\nto know the truth... Am I wrong?
14	O	...No, that's precisely it.
15	O	I decided I didn't want to forget,\neven if it hurts.
16	5	Still, a bit early to be making\ndecisions, though, huh?
17	9	True, true. We not used key yet.
18	8	Friend got to keep it together.
19	8	Fiona already learn, there more\nin world than can see with eyes.
20	O	...Yeah. Thank you, Rickles.

1		Ah...
2		A seashell and...glass?
3		And some...thingamajig...?
4		They're from me... Gifts for her birthday.
5		The shell, it's from when we found matching ones.
6		And this...
7		A charm we all made together.
8		They've been stored carefully. They were important.
9		But she wanted them locked away.\nHer feelings...
10		It would be a whole lot easier\nif we just pinned her as bad.
11		Problem is, though,\nthat'd be missing the whole point.
12		It's hard to sort fact from fiction.
13		That's why we're stuck, umming and ahing.
14		Have you found it now? What matters?
15		To make it through...
16		She reminded me at the very end.
17		And our promise...
18		It lives within me even now.
19		Friend can keep promise?
20		Yeah.
21		Finally...
22		I understand.
23		Irma...
24		And this? We just gonna leave it?
25		Mm. It'll be easier to show everyone,\nrather than just telling them.
26		So you'll tell 'em? What the deal is?
27		Some won't be able to accept it, I'm sure.
28		But still...
29		For the new Colony Mu...
30		We have to be strong enough to face anything,\neven things we don't want to see.
31		Unless we can overcome that hurdle,\nI think, we won't be able to really change.
32		And that...
33		That's what Irma taught me.
34		Are you all right...?
35		Thanks, Sennie. I'm fine.
36		Irma's not with us any more,
37		but the things that she left for me are many.
38		The colony, my friends...
39		I'll protect them with all my might.
40		Come on.\nThere's a lot to do.
evt/tq/msg_tq012306.json

2		I've got something to say to you all.
3		I'm sorry for the worries.
4		I wasn't sure... If I should tell you...
5		About Irma...
6		Did something...happen?
7		We thought you were just out of sorts.\nThat you were trying to get over her death.
8		There's more to it than that, then?
9		...Yeah.
10		I couldn't... I couldn't face it.
11		I just didn't want to see you all hurt.
12		I was only seeing what I wanted to.
13		I think... I think doing that only hurt you more.
14		Hang on, what's this about?
15		You didn't do anything wrong, Fifi!
16		Irma was wrong, but she wasn't the only one.
17		It took some time,
18		but now I know.
19		I want to...start again.
20		Work to rebuild it all.
21		I want to come clean. Will you hear my story?
22		I'm a lousy commander. Sorry.
23		Oh, come off it.
24		We're the ones who should be sorry,
25		for letting you struggle, alone.
26		It might take some time...
27		Is that all right?
28		Of course!
29		Fifiiii!
30		We'll help you shoulder it!
31		Of course we will! We all will!
32		Wow. She sure is brave...\nfor such a crybaby.
33		She was afraid of making mistakes, before now...\nDo you think she's over that?
34		Eh, I doubt it'll be that easy.
35		But, so what if she does?
36		At least now, she knows she won't\nbe staying wrong for long.
37		I reckon that's the case, anyhow.
38		Makes you think. We could learn from them.
39		Yeah.

1	dW1	Affirmative. Adaptation to environment\nis proceeding favorably.
2	3	Still can't believe this is your new home.\nI'll be honest, I had my doubts. But hey,\nlooks like you made it work!
3	6	If there's anything you need or want,\ndon't be afraid to ask us, OK?
4	dW1	...Actually.
5	dW1	May I make...one request?
6	6	Of course! What is it?
7	dW1	Sena, your...
8	6	Uh-huh, my what?
9	dW1	Your onigiri. I, ah... I'd like to...\nFor everyone in the Colony...
10	6	Ohhhhhh...! Now that you mention it,\nI remember you talked about it before.
11	dW1	Before we came here, we suffered\nmuch hardship...
12	dW1	At least... I thought it would be optimal\nto reward them with something...
13	6	Right, of course! That sounds\nlike a great idea.
14	6	But are you sure you want the\nonigiri? There are lots of foods\nthat are much nicer...
15	dW1	...I want your onigiri, Sena.
16	2	Heh, would you look at that, Sena?\nLooks like your cooking's found a fan!
17	6	Ahahah... Well, if you insist that strongly,\nI'll have to put my best foot forward!
18	1	So, it sounds like we'll need quite a lot of\nmythrice this time.
19	6	Yeah, if we wanna make enough\nfor everyone...we'll have to ask\nColony Lambda to share again.
20	dW1	Segiri volunteering for support.\nFerron manipulators should be\ncapable of forming the onigiri.
21	6	Oh, uh, thanks, Segiri!\nThat'll be handy, heheh...heh...

1	lY1	...Before I do, I would like to\nverify my assumptions first.
2	lY1	The number of remaining Ferrons\nin Colony 0 is a total of seven...
3	lY1	And the Ferron ignition circuit is secured\nwith an Iris recognition lock, meaning that\nnone save us are authorized to pilot them.
4	lY1	Therefore, their use by Keves and Agnus\nis fundamentally impossible. Correct?
5	dW1	Affirmative. No errors detected\nin preceding statements.
6	lY1	...Hrm...
7	dW1	...No. 6?
8	lY1	No. 7, I ask for your calm.
9	lY1	While reconnoitering in the Fornis region,\nI confirmed the existence of an eighth unit.
10	dW1	Ah! Unexpected...
11	lY1	The identification number\nwas for...Unit No. 13.
12	dW1	Are you certain?\nDoes this suggest she is alive...?
13	lY1	...I have no evidence.\nThe signal disappeared quickly,\nand I could find no other leads.
14	lY1	I have informed nobody of this incident so\nfar. I didn't wish to cause undue agitation.
15	lY1	However... I decided that you should be\nappraised of the situation, No. 7.
16	lY1	I, uh... I know it's been on your mind,\never since she disappeared...
17	dW1	Thank you...
18	lY1	This concludes the report.\nLooking forward to this onigiri,\nor what have you.
19	6	Hey, Segiri! All done?
20	dW1	Affirmative.\nUnit No. 7 is ready to depart on command.
21	3	Hah, someone sounds eager!\nWell then, shall we hit the road?
22	dW1	If she is indeed alive,\nI should have felt the connection.

2	yc1	Oh, I'm terribly sorry to disappoint,\nbut our stores are currently empty...
3	6	Oh... Really? That's a shame...
4	4	When we came by last time, didn't you\nimply you had considerable stockpiles?
5	yc1	...Well, to be honest, it's not just mythrice\nwe're lacking.
6	yc1	Recently we've been having quite a few\nincidents of shipments being attacked.
7	yc1	Food, Levnis parts... You name it,\nwe're probably short on it.
8	1	Well, that sounds like a bigger problem\nthan you'd normally encounter.
9	4	What about your escort units?\nSurely they accompany your transports.
10	yc1	Yeah, of course, they\ncertainly should have done.
11	yc1	But maybe you should talk to the\nchief of logistics for details...
evt/tq/msg_tq012403f.json
0	5	Right, so. Bit of a dead end with the\nmythrice. What do we do now, Sena?
1	6	Hmmm... Yeah, that's one thing, but...
2	dW1	Sena.
3	6	Hm? Something wrong, Segiri?
4	dW1	Perhaps it is advisable to put the search\nfor mythrice on hold and focus our efforts\non these attack incidents.
5	6	Huh...?
6	dW1	I am inferring from past behavior patterns.\nThis course of action is congruent with\nyour actions I observed up to this point.
7	6	Ahh...
8	3	Ha! Sounds like she's got you clocked, love.\nDoubt you can get outta this one, even if\nyou wanted, which you probably don't.
9	6	Heh heh! Yeah, you're right.\nSegiri's got it in one.
10	6	Let's capture the crooks that attacked\nthe transports and get back the stolen\nmythrice!
11	dW1	Compliance.
12	1	All right, now that that's decided,\nwhere should we begin?
13	4	We ought to talk to the logistics chief\nthat our contact mentioned. They may\nknow more about the assailants.
evt/tq/msg_tq012404f.json
0	6	Hey, excuse me...?\nCan we talk to you for a minute?
1	rc1	Hm? Ah, yeah, sure thing... What ca-
2	rc1	Aaaagh?!
3	rc1	Wh-why's that inside the Colony...?\nHow did it infiltrate us?!
4	2	Hey, hang on...! What's gotten into you?
5	rc1	Don't act dumb! That's the Levnis that\nattacked us, isn't it?!
6	3	Whaaaaaaa-?!
7	5	Wait, what're you saying?\nYou think the person who\nattacked the transport was...
8	dW1	...Ah!
9	6	No! You got it all wrong! We haven't done\nanything, and Segiri's been-
10	4	Sena, breathe.
11	6	But! This guy's-!
12	4	So just to confirm...the Levnis, or whatever\nit is you saw - are you certain it was the\nsame as this machine?
13	rc1	Whuh?! I just told you, didn't-
14	rc1	...Hm? No, hang on...\nNow that I look closely, maybe\nit's not quite the same...?
15	rc1	Oh, and anyway, you lot helped\nus earlier...
16	5	Oh, finally twigged, have you?\nThink before you make a ruckus\nnext time, all right, mate?
17	rc1	Oh, and anyway, aren't you\nCommander Isurd's friends...?
18	4	Yes. Yes, we are.\nHave you calmed down now?\nCan we talk peacefully?
19	rc1	I-I'm terribly sorry...!\nIt's just, this Levnis, it freaked me out...
20	dW1	We are investigating this matter.\nFor the benefit of ascertaining the culprit,\nwe request information sharing.
21	rc1	...In that case, you should speak to\nSergeant Tonya, she's been assigned\nto the investigation.
22	rc1	If you're willing to lend us a hand,\nshe should be your first port of call.
23	rc1	I imagine she'll have gotten some\ninformation by now. I hope it'll prove\nuseful to you...
24	5	Hey, say now...\nWhat the spark is going on here?
25	dW1	...
26	6	Don't worry, Segiri. We all trust you.
27	3	You said it. It can't have been the others\nfrom Colony 0, either, I'm sure.
28	dW1	If we are to ascertain the truth...I believe\nthat all possibilities must be considered.
29	1	In other words, we don't know enough yet\nto conclude that the culprit was a Ferron.\nRight?
30	dW1	...Indeed.
31	6	That's right!\nWe'll get to the bottom of this!
32	dW1	Yes. We will.\n...We must.
33	dW1	Is it coincidence? Or is it...her?
evt/tq/msg_tq012405f.json
0	xc1	The logistics chief told me you were\ncoming. You wanted to talk about the\nattacker?
1	6	Whitby said you might have some clue.
2	xc1	...I'll be honest, we don't really\nknow anything about that Levnis's\nwhereabouts yet.
3	xc1	However, it seems that there may have\nbeen a similar incident involving goods\nstolen by a Levnis at Colony 4.
4	4	Your guess is that the perpetrator\nof the Colony 4 attack was the same\nperson who was responsible here?
5	xc1	Yeah, I think they might be.
6	5	Really, though...? That's a long way to go...
7	xc1	If nothing is done, other colonies may\nalso suffer losses to goods and materiel.
8	xc1	I was hoping you guys would be able to\nvisit Colony 4 and investigate matters\non the ground.
9	3	Why us? What's wrong with\nyou lot handling it?
10	xc1	If we Agnians did anything like that\npublicly, we would arouse lots of\nsuspicion.
11	2	Especially, immediately after\ngetting raided...
12	xc1	Yeah, exactly. It would be hard for us\nto investigate any further.
13	xc1	But also, since I hear you guys are all\nbuddy-buddy with the Colony 4 folks...
14	1	Yes, I see your point. Guess we're in\nthe best position to take this on.\nAll right, we'll take a look.
15	dW1	Before we depart, I request\na quick confirmation.
16	dW1	The Levnis that attacked the transport,\nwas it similar to this unit?
17	xc1	...Hmm, if I remember correctly,\nI think they could be the same model.
18	dW1	...Understood. Thank you\nfor your cooperation.
19	4	It seems we can conclude that the\nperpetrator of the attack on the transport\nwas a Ferron, after all...
20	5	Taion, mate, pal...\nYou always know exactly what to say.
21	4	Just stating the facts.
22	4	Regardless, no matter if it's a Ferron,\nor an as-yet unknown Levnis model,\nthe real problem lies elsewhere.
23	4	What's important is who was piloting it.
24	dW1	No. 13...
25	3	Uhh? Are we gonna like this?
26	dW1	...I have information to offer.
27	dW1	Probability is high that the objective\nis a Ferron. Assuming that is correct...
28	dW1	I believe I may have knowledge of\nthe operator's identity.
29	6	Whoa, really? But, all the folks from\nColony 0 were accounted for...
30	dW1	...Several years ago, a soldier went\nmissing in action after an accident\nduring a mission.
31	dW1	That was No. 13.\nThe operator of Ferron unit No. 13.
32	6	I see...
33	dW1	At the time, neither the husk nor the\nFerron were recovered, leading to No. 13\nbeing declared killed in the line of duty...
34	1	But you're saying it's possible she's\nstill alive somewhere today, is that it?
35	2	If No. 13 got separated from her\ncomrades, no wonder she'd be pushed\nto steal supplies in order to survive...
36	dW1	...I have no proof for the conjecture.\nHowever...
37	dW1	If No. 13 truly is alive, then this time\naround... I will be sure to...
38	6	Segiri... Have you been worrying about this\never since we talked to Whitby...?
39	dW1	...
40	1	All right. It looks like we've got\none more objective to add to the list.
41	6	Right-o! To bring No. 13 back to safety!\nSound about right, Segiri?
42	dW1	...Yes, Sena.
43	5	All right then. Time to head to Colony 4\nand look for clues, just like Tonya said.
evt/tq/msg_tq012406f.json
0	sZ1	Ah, you guys! Hi there.\nUh, could you keep it brief?\nI'm kinda snowed under...
1	3	Then we'll get right to it.\nSomeone hit one of your transports, yeah?
2	sZ1	...Whuh? Where'd you hear tha-\nOh, whatever. At least it will be quick.
3	sZ1	Remember before, when a secret\nmessenger we sent to our allies\ngot attacked?
4	sZ1	The same Levnis from that time\nshowed up again, only this time,\nit went after...well, you already know.
5	2	Do you have anything that might help us\ntrack them?
6	sZ1	Oh, you guys are tracking them too?
7	5	Yeah, for a few reasons. You wanna\nlet us handle your side of it as well?
8	sZ1	...Sure, since you ask so nicely.
9	1	Cheers, Maxie, we owe you.\nAnd sorry for the hassle.
10	sZ1	Nah, don't mention it. This isn't the\ntime for personal feelings. Best focus\non resolving the matter at hand.
11	sZ1	According to my info, the attack took place\naround the border between here and the\nDannagh Desert.
12	sZ1	If you search every nook and cranny\nthereabouts, you might find something.
13	1	Understood. Then we'll\nhave to go do just that.
14	sZ1	I'm sure it goes without saying, but\nI'll say it anyway - be real sparking\ncareful. ...Oh, and good luck.
evt/tq/msg_tq012407f.json
0	4	There are crucial parts missing.\nPerhaps someone was trying to\nrepurpose them?
1	5	More importantly, there's nothing else here.\nDid we come here for nothing?
2	P	...Evidence of Ferron activity detected.
3	6	Huh? What, where...?
4	P	Visual sensors have detected\nresidual Flame Clock energy.
5	P	Its signature is unique to mobile\narmored units utilizing a Flame Clock\nfor propulsion.
6	3	Wow, you can find stuff like that? Nifty!
7	P	The trail leads in the direction of the\ndesert. Pursuit is currently possible,\nand advised.
8	6	Then let's go after them, Segiri!
9	P	Compliance.
evt/tq/msg_tq012408f.json
0	1	A door?\nWhat's it doing in a place like this?
1	6	...Uhmm, doesn't want to open.\nWhat do we do?
2	5	Aha! Sounds like a job for Lanz!\nDinky door like this, all I need is\na bit of a running start, and...
3	dW1	Interfacing with security seal...\nEntering override code... Clear.
4	dW1	Entry lock has been released.
5	5	...O-oh, cool. Cheers.
6	3	Might be a bit late to ask, but since we're\nabout to meet this No. 13... What kind of\nperson is she?
7	dW1	No. 13 was the foremost\nFerron pilot in Colony 0.
8	dW1	In terms of pure battle prowess,\nshe exceeds my own.
9	4	If she attacks us before we can explain\nthe situation, things might go badly for us.
10	dW1	That will not be an issue.\nNo. 13 will respond to me.
11	6	You've got a lot of trust in her.
12	dW1	Yes. I am sure she will understand.
13	3	Cool, cool. Well then, what say we\nget this teary reunion underway?

5		Ferron unit...
6		No. 13.
7		So...it is her!
8		Thirteen!
9		No. 7...
10		Huh? Segiri...?
11		Please...
12		I need some time.
13		Uh... OK!
14		Thirteen...
15		No. 7! Ahahah! I don't believe it, it's really you!
16		It's been so long, No. 7!
17		I thought I'd never ever see you again!
18		Agreed, Thirteen.
19		I should have realized this sooner.
20		If I had...this wouldn't have...
21		No! Don't worry a bit!\nAnyway, it wasn't all terrible for me.
22		I mean, I almost died, and I was alone for ages,\nbut it's all been worth it. I finally realized something!
23		...And what is that?
24		All of us Ferron pilots... From the moment we were born, we\ndidn't actually have to follow any of the orders we were given!
25		We only thought we did, do you understand?\nBut it wasn't true in the slightest!
26		See for yourself! Nobody gives me any orders,\nbut I'm still able to survive like this, right?!
27		In other words... You have learned\nhow to issue orders to yourself?
28		Ahahah, what a weird way to put it!
29		But yeah, maybe you could say that!
30		From this point on, all of us can run free,
31		live life just how we want to...
32		So come on, No. 7...
33		Let's you and me go on a rampage together.
34		Spread mayhem to the entire world. Please?
35		...Huh?
36		All the things and people that made us what we are now...\nNow it's our turn to do with them as we like!
37		We can loot and steal, we can smash and burn...
38		We can even...murder.
39		Right? Doesn't that just give you chills, No. 7?
40		You're with me, right, No. 7? You've gotta be!
41		T-Thirteen...
42		What are you talking about?
43		Uhm... Wait, what are *you* talking about?
44		What's wrong? You've always understood me, No. 7!
45		That is...
46		Oh no...
47		How very strange... I don't seem to understand you either.
48		Before now, I always understood everything about you, No. 7.
49		Thirteen, I'm Segiri now!
50		Please listen!
51		"Segiri"?
52		What is a "Segiri"? No. 7, you're No. 7.
53		Seriously, what's gotten into you?
54		What about you?!
55		I see. Now it makes sense.
56		Now I understand why the connection\nbetween us has up and disappeared.
57		Thirteen, what do you mean?
58		I and No. 7 have always been together...
59		But, ah well, things change, right?
60		I can see that your heart...\nbelongs over there now.
61		(shocked gasp)
62		Sorry, Segiri!\nBut this, this is something I can't ignore!
63		Sena... Negative...!
64		She's coming! In the Ferron, now!

1	P	Everyone is waiting for you.\nThirteen, let us go home.
2	io1	...Home? Where is that?
3	io1	Huh? Where can I go back to?\nWhere am I supposed to go?
4	P	Thirteen... You will always...
5	io1	Don't you get it, No. 7?
6	io1	From the very start, there's never been\na place for us in this world...
7	io1	That's why I wanted to make one.\nAnd to do that, everything else\nmust first be torn down.
8	io1	We have to burn this world that Moebius\nlove so much, down to the ground, then\ntake back all that they stole from us.
9	P	Is that why you attacked and pillaged\nthe colony units?
10	P	Keep on doing that and you only\ncreate more enemies, and for what?

12	P	...
13	dW1	...I am sorry, Thirteen.
14	io1	What for...?
15	dW1	I thought... Of all people, you would\nsurely understand my reasoning.
16	dW1	But by doing that, I over-relied on\nthe connection I thought we had, and\nneglected to pay attention to the real you.
17	dW1	I failed to consider how deeply you\nmust have felt about us, and now I have\nlost you.
18	io1	...
19	dW1	Listen please, Thirteen.
20	dW1	This world... It is not as cruel and\nheartless as you have thought.
21	dW1	There are people, even outside of\nColony 0, who accepted me as Segiri.\nAs their own.
22	dW1	And if that is true, there must be a place\nwe can call home.
23	io1	...
24	io1	...You really have changed.\nI don't think the old No. 7 would\never say something like that.
25	dW1	Since I and the others have changed,\nit would follow that the world itself\nmay also change...
26	dW1	Or do you think that reasoning\nis false, Thirteen?
27	io1	Hahahah...
28	io1	Ohh, you really are something else,\nNo. 7. Who but you would think of\nothers so much?
29	dW1	On the day that you disappeared, No. 13,\nI made a decision.
30	dW1	Even if my fate was to run down my\nClock to the last, I would defend every\nlast person in Colony 0...
31	io1	I see...
32	io1	Isn't it funny...? I had the same idea,\nand tried my hardest to achieve it...
33	dW1	That is precisely why, if our roles\nwere reversed, I would have chosen\njust as you have.
34	io1	Hahah... You may well have.\nI suppose we aren't so different, after all.
35	dW1	Yes. And, we *are* connected.\nNow, and forever...
36	io1	...That's right.
37	io1	Well then, I feel relieved...
38	dW1	...Ah! Thirteen! Wait!
evt/tq/msg_tq012411f.json
0	1	...A dead end.
1	4	We had the entrance covered.\nThere shouldn't have been any other\nway through...
2	5	...Sparks, you don't think she\njumped off from here, do you...?
3	dW1	No. Thirteen is alive.
4	6	...You can tell?
5	dW1	No. 13 and I have had a "connection"\nsince the moment of birth.
6	6	A connection...?
7	dW1	I would conjecture it to be\na phenomenon akin to telepathy.
8	dW1	My sense of it had been severed after\nshe disappeared...
9	dW1	But now, I can feel No. 13's existence\nclearly once again.
10	6	Could it be connected somehow to\nyou and her being so similar?
11	dW1	...That is unclear.\nHowever, there may be some kind\nof causal connection between the two.
12	3	Ahh... Mystery upon mystery...
13	1	It would be good to meet her again.
14	6	I guess we'll have to make enough onigiri\nfor one more person next time.
15	dW1	I would like that.\nAnd I conjecture No. 13 would too.
16	5	Well, we've come a long way on our\nquest to make some rice balls.
17	2	Hahah, after all that effort, I bet Sena's\nonigiri will taste that much better.
18	6	Mimi...\nI don't really need the extra pressure...
19	3	You know what does need pressure?\nThe mythrice! Let's grab what was stolen\nand skedaddle.
20	1	Yeah. We should give the good news\nto colonies 4 and Lambda while we're\nat it.
21	dW1	...Yes.

1		Thank you for your efforts.
2		Everyone is exceedingly grateful.
3		Ahahaha...
4		It's a bit of a shock to me that the onigiri\nwere a hit with the others, not just you!
5		It's given me a kick in the butt!\nMaybe I should go ahead and learn to cook properly?
6		Is that something you "want to do", Sena?
7		Uh, ummm... When you put it like that...
8		I guess maybe that's a bit much.
9		Is that so.
10		Sena...
11		Mm?
12		I would like...
13		to create a new "Colony".
14		Hmm? A new..."Colony"?\nSo, you mean different from Colony 0?
15		Yes.
16		It would be a place where we would not have to
17		hurt others and steal to live.
18		Where, even if we go far away,
19		we'll have a place to come back to.
20		A colony we can all call home...
21		That's what I want to make.
22		I seeee...
23		Sounds to me, you've finally found your calling.
24		If I had not met you Ouroboros,
25		I would have...remained "No. 7".
26		Would not have reconciled with Thirteen...
27		I might even have had to harm her...

1	Q	...Somethin' wrong?
2	fk1	Sorta... Just the other day, one of our\nsquads got chased by a ginormous\nmonster.
3	Q	Yeah? How big are we talking here?
4	fk1	Big. Really big.\nIt got them good, too...
5	3	Eh, par for the course with monsters\nreally. 'Course some of them are gonna\ngrow ginormous.
6	5	Sure.\nWe've seen some stonkin' big ones too.
7	Q	So, what's the story then? They got\nattacked by monsters and ran home,\ntails between legs? Dags, the lot of 'em...
8	fk1	No, you're not getting it.\nIt was just one monster, and\nit chased off the whole team.
9	fk1	It was a scavenger team from engineering,\non a mission in the Fornis region.
10	Q	You don't say... I'm starting to respect\nthis monster more than I respect you lot.
11	5	If they got wrecked by a single enemy,\nthey musta got careless. Even if it is\na big 'un.
12	4	...I wouldn't be too harsh.\nIf a monster senses weakness,\nit can strike without warning.
13	fk1	Uh, no, it's more like...\nWell... They say it let them go...
14	Q	Uh...sorry, do my ears need rinsing?\n'Cause I coulda sworn you just said\na monster "let them go".
15	fk1	Y-yes... That's what I heard...
16	fk1	They say it didn't keep up the attack.\nThat it just wandered off at some point...
17	Q	Well, it's a fun story and all, but it\nsounds like a massive crock to me.
18	fk1	Yeah, I'm not 100% convinced either,\nbut knowing these guys, they wouldn't\njust make it up for a lark.
19	1	I don't think we should doubt that\nthey really did come under attack...
20	4	The part about being allowed to escape,\nhowever, is mystifying. I wasn't aware of\nany monsters with that behavior pattern.
21	fk1	...A-anyway, I thought you might want\nto know about it, Boss. Stroke of luck\nthat I managed to catch you.
22	Q	You did good, soldier. I'll take a look.\nAfter all, where would we all be if I didn't\nstep in to clean up all your messes, eh?

0	6	It should be somewhere around here,\nright...?
1	4	Rumors have a tendency to\nbecome overblown. A similar\nprinciple may be at work here.

3	Q	I don't really have time for this.\nWhy don't you shitheels get\nto the bottom of this, huh?
4	6	You seemed interested enough earlier...
5	Q	Don't get me wrong, I am a mite curious.\nI wanna know about the thing that beat\nmy men black and blue.
6	5	If it turns out to be a tall tale,\nthen that'll be the end of it.
7	5	But either way, I guess we can\njust beat it up? That way, no more\nthreat. Job's a good 'un.
8	Q	I like the cut of your jib, guy.\nThat's right, no need to overthink it.
9	Q	We see something ginormous, we beat it\nup. We see anything else, we still beat\nit up!
10	Q	Easy-peasy.
11	2	That's one way to look at things...
12	Q	Anyway, we've already come out here.\nWe can sweat the details, or we can do\nthings the easy way. Right?
13	1	Ghondor does have a point.\nIt might be better for us to shelve the\nspeculation and just start looking.
14	2	Hey, over there...
15	3	...Those guys sure don't look OK.
16	Q	Hey, you there! You still alive?
17	Yc1	Grk... Whuh...?\nWho're you lot...?
18	1	What happened to you?
19	Yc1	We were attacked...by a fiend.
20	Q	Huh? A "fiend"?
21	Yc1	We were in combat with an Agnian colony,\nwhen it blindsided all of us...
22	Yc1	We did our best to escape, but it was\npretty catastrophic for both sides...
23	3	Where was it you were fighting?\nWe've been looking for that mudder.
24	Yc1	It was Singbreeze Funnel.\nYou should take care though, that thing\nwasn't an everyday kind of monster.
25	Q	Let's take a look.\nCould be we've hit paydirt.

4	1	Yeah!
evt/tq/msg_tq012503f.json
0	Zc1	Phew, we owe you...\nWait, who are you?
1	5	Just passing by. Ah, but we met\nsome of your mates earlier, I think.
2	Zc1	I-I see... So they made it out alive.
3	Q	You lot are pathetic...\nGetting done in by this small fry? Pff.
4	Zc1	No, you got it wrong! Before we got\nambushed by those things you just took\ndown, we were fighting a ginormous Tirkin!
5	Q	Oh wow, I take it all back, then.\nClearly you are all valiant soldiers.\nWho got...messed up...by a Tirkin.
6	2	Admittedly, these monsters\nwere pretty large...
7	6	They were pretty strong, but...\nwas it really such a big deal?
8	Zc1	Spark it all...\nIt was a huge one that did us in...
9	Zc1	Anyway, we'll go rendezvous\nwith our friends. Sorry for\ndragging you out here...
10	Q	...Well that was a bloody waste of my\ntime and talents. "Ginormous Tirkin",\nmy shapely arse...
11	4	It's difficult to believe that Tirkins would\neven nest in this area.
12	5	And it's not like we could just go\nand rustle 'em up if they did.
13	3	OK, so what's the plan?\nDo we go back?
14	Q	I just can't get over how we came\nall the way out here and we didn't\neven get into a decent scrap...
15	Q	It's exactly this kinda shit that\nreally roils...my...guts...
16	Q	...Whoa...
17	Q	Well...
18	Q	Now we're talkin'!\nThat's what I wanna sink my teeth into!
19	ac1	Kraw-?!
20	1	Wha-?
21	Q	Get after him, ya lily-livered dags!
evt/tq/msg_tq012504f.json
0	Q	Why were you running?!
1	ac1	'Koz you were chasing, kraa!\nAnybody run away when skary!
2	Q	But you're a ginormous Tirkin!
3	5	When she puts it like that...
4	3	It's definitely more ginormous\nthan a normal Tirkin...
5	ac1	What is big idea, kraa...?\nBarging into roost with muddy foots...\nIt shows poor breeding.
6	Q	Don't act innocent, beak-freak!\nYou're the one who messed up my guys!
7	ac1	Kraa...? And what problem with dat...?
8	Q	You wanna know the problem?\nHow about I explain it to you with my\nfists, you shit-crusted featherbrain!
9	ac1	I not know where hoomans kame from,\nbut dey attak me, so I chase away!\nDat is end of story.
10	ac1	Lot of ruckus in neighborbrood recent.\nTirkin just want peace and quiet! Quiet!\nThat too much to ask?
11	4	We did hear it let the soldiers get away...
12	ac1	Hmph. You hoomans think we special,\nkeep koming to kapture and attak us...
13	ac1	When Tirkins get attaked, we return kraw\nfor kraa. But we never attak hoomans if\nhoomans not attak us!!!
14	5	What, so you weigh up whether\nor not you wanna pick a fight?
15	ac1	Hoomans not any different, kraaa...\nViolence only breed more violence.\nDerefore, when hit Tirkins, expect hit bak.
16	Q	Did you just threaten me?\nWow, you've got guts, flockhead.\nI think I'll grill 'em for supper!
17	1	Hold on, let's not get heated, Ghondor.\nIt does make a lot of sense, what he's\nsaying.
18	Q	Tch...
19	2	So, tell us... Why are you here?
20	ac1	Dere no big mystery... Had argue over\nterritory, so now Tirkins just look for easy\nliving place...
21	6	Somewhere comfy?
22	ac1	Komfy, yes. Kraa...
23	ac1	Tirkins is not island.\nJust like hoomans.
24	Q	Not an island? What, you're gonna\nbuild some kind of bird confederacy\nand then attack us...?
25	ac1	No kon-feather-ates...\nI not attak in flok like you.\nWhen fighting, I alone.
26	2	So... What do you mean,\nyou're not an island...?
27	Q	It has...kids?
28	ac1	Dese are my Tirklets. I search for easy\nliving place for dem, kraa.
29	Q	...Uhh.
30	6	Ohhhhh...
31	ac1	That why when strangers attak,\nI has to fight bak.
32	ac1	Hoomans only flok with birds of same\nfeather. I try talk sometime, but dey\nonly run away.
33	3	Can't really speak for you personally, bud,\nbut it sounds like you've had it rough.
34	ac1	Very rough! Like trouble with neighbors\nwasn't bad enuff, dere also little food to\neat...
35	ac1	Me think, soon time for move again.\nNew place, with no hoomans.\nBetter grazing...
36	Q	...What, you don't get enough grub here?
37	ac1	That right. I Tirkin gourmet!
38	5	I don't think you get to be picky\nin your case, mate!
39	ac1	...Was little Tirkin joke.\nPlan to move, it for provide better food\nopportunity for Tirklets.
40	ac1	Just before, I go out to forage\nfor Tirklet dinner.
41	2	Oh no...\nSo when you bumped into us earlier...
42	ac1	That right, then I chased again.\nIs some kind of instinct for hoomans,\nchasing Tirkins? Day komplete ruined...
43	Q	So if you had that food,\nyou could move?
44	ac1	If we had enough food for migrate,\nwe kould leave within hour.
45	ac1	But this neighborbrood, so many\nhoomans and monsters. Migration\nhave to wait long time...
46	Q	Hrmmm...
47	Q	Oh, all right. We'll do your shopping.
48	Q	Let's see now, this neck of the woods...\nJuicy Broccoli and Zapcaps should do it?
49	1	Ghondor, are you sure?
50	Q	We'll be back with the food,\nso you and your brats get\nready to leave, all right?
51	ac1	Kraa...? Kind hooman really exist?\nHave to adjust expektations for future.
52	ac1	Ah, hooman can also bring ten\nSpringroots?
53	Q	Hey, don't push your luck. It still ain't\ntoo late for me to barbecue you. And\nanyway, you brought this on yourself.
54	3	So we're really doing this?
55	5	I'm guessing Ghondor's got\nsome kind of a thought here.\nMight as well tag along.
56	Q	Showing good judgment there, meathead.\nMaybe you're not hopeless after all.
57	5	What's that?\nYou hungry for a knuckle sandwich?
58	ac1	Kraa... Sorry for bother, hoomans.\nThis very big help.
evt/tq/msg_tq012505f.json
0	6	Sooo, umm...\nJuicy Broccoli and Zapcaps, was it?
1	6	We managed to find a good number.\nDo you think this'll be enough...?
2	Q	I wouldn't worry about it. It's not like\nthey'll be able to tell the difference.
3	Q	Should be enough for the kids, anyhow.\nThe lurching monstrosity'll make do.
4	6	Wait, Ghondor... You're actually\nworried about the little ones...?
5	Q	Hmph. Hardly.
6	4	You do realize there's a chance that\nthe large one has been lying to us, right?
7	Q	If it turns out he has, we just\npunch his lights out. Simple.
8	4	Well, be that as it may...
9	Q	If we get them to move away ASAP,\nit saves us a world of trouble.
10	1	It's true. If they relocate somewhere\nfurther away from us, everyone's lives\nwill be more peaceful.
11	2	All right. Let's get this back to them\nthen, and we can wrap this-
12	1	What was that?!

9	3	Wait, chill out you guys!\nThis isn't what you think...!
10	Yc1	That thing's a monster!
11	5	Just leave it alone if you\nknow what's good for ya!
12	Yc1	You think we could show our faces back\nhome if we got done in by an overgrown\nTirkin? Give me a break!
13	Yc1	If you're itching to get in our way,\nwe'll just have to give you a beating!

1	1	Yeah...
2	Q	I don't care if it's a Tirkin. Seeing someone\ndie before your eyes and not being able to\ndo anything about it, it's... It's shit.
3	6	But...I think we did all we could...
4	Q	Ah... Yeah, I guess.
5	Q	Hey, you lot. Got a job for ya.
6	5	A job?
7	Q	You heard the bird...\nWe gotta take 'em with.
8	Q	...I, uh...did kinda bring this on us all.
9	4	I don't really think it's your responsibility.
10	Q	Hmph. Did I ask you?
11	Q	What's it gonna be? You kids coming?\nOr would you rather stay here with\nDaddy?
12	Q	All right, go say your farewells.\nBut it's not safe here any more, so don't\ntake any longer than you have to.
13	2	Ghondor... Are you sure about this?
14	Q	Life put them in front of me,\nso I wanted to do what I could\nto make their lot bearable.
15	Q	And now it's just the little ones left.
16	Q	If they say they wanna live,\nI can at least give them that much.
17	6	You're right...\nI think that's the best way.
18	Q	Yeah, life can be a bitch sometimes...\nBut what's the alternative...?
19	Q	None of us planned it, but we're family\nnow. ...And family has to stick together,\nright?
20	2	Makes sense.
21	Q	I'll tell you right now, the work will be\nhard. You'll have to scratch for your own\ngrain.
22	Q	You sure you still want it?
23	Q	Your dad was a tough customer.\nDon't you ever forget that.

26	Q	Mind yer damn business!\nYou're not the ones who's gonna have to\nteach stuff to non-verbal bird things.

1	R	Sure. What's going on?
2	dl1	You remember what we talked about?
3	R	...Hrm.
4	D	So help me, Gray...\nYou mind sparing us the scowl?
5	D	You're making them nervous.
6	R	I highly doubt that.
7	3	No, uh, actually you are.
8	D	Haha... There you have it.\nThere's no helping this guy...\nStubborn as they come, he is.
9	3	Oh yeah...\nYou were, uh, "married", weren't you?
10	D	Oh, I didn't know you\nknew each other.
11	6	This lady...\nShe's Gray's partner, right?
12	dl1	Hah, yes, that's right.
13	3	What about babies?\nYou guys got any babies?
14	R	Errr... Um!
15	D	Hahaha! So it seems that\neven the unflinching Gray\ncan be caught unawares.
16	R	...Can we be done with the tomfoolery?\nJust tell me what you wanted, and quick.
17	dl1	It's about the investigation. It was still\nongoing until recently, but-
18	D	...Wait. Someone could overhear us if\nwe do this here. I'll prepare a secure\nlocation - we can talk in more detail then.
19	1	What are we even talking about...?
20	R	Nothing that concerns you.
21	D	Actually, I'm thinking of\nasking for their help.
22	R	What?!
23	D	They've been very cooperative in\nmatters like this one. I think you'll find\ntheir assistance beneficial.
24	R	I will, will I...? Well...all right.
25	D	Right then. Rozana, you can fill them in.
26	dl1	Sure thing. Thanks, Monica.
evt/tq/msg_tq012601f.json
0	R	Right, nobody should bother us here.\nNow let's hear it.
1	dl1	OK... Well, we've been investigating for a\nwhile, and we discovered some suspicious\nactivity from some of our own City folk.
2	5	What suspicious activity?
3	dl1	My husband here initially asked me\nif I could do something about the\nhardliners' aggressive policies.
4	R	We knew those guys were up to no good,\nso we were trying to take precautions.
5	dl1	Well, listen to this. Apparently,\nthe hardliners might be using City\ntechnology to nefarious ends.
6	dl1	It sounds like something was\nstolen from R&D...
7	dl1	And we expect that that "something" will\nbe abused to further their goals. Though\nwe can't say what those are, exactly.
8	4	What could have driven them to this?
9	R	You have to understand, this place\nisn't as monolithic as it might seem.
10	R	Some folks take a really inflexible stance\ntowards issues they might have, no matter\nhow small. That's the long and short of it.
11	dl1	Yes, it's just that this time, the problems\nhave come to a head somewhat.
12	dl1	We like to avoid unrest within the City\nas much as is reasonably possible,\nso I asked my husband for guidance.
13	dl1	And additionally, I figured that you\nmight lend your assistance, as well.
14	2	Oh, I see...
15	6	So that's what's going on here...
16	1	Yes, of course we'll help.
17	3	Although, you know you could've\ncome to us with this in the first place,\nright, Gray?
18	R	...Hrm.
19	dl1	Sorry about my husband. You know,\nhe's not the most communicative type.
20	3	Understatement of the year...
21	5	...Huh, it just struck me.\nGray's all...wrinkly, but you're not.
22	dl1	Oh? Oh, hahah, you're right.\nI'm a lot younger than he is,\nso that's certainly part of it.
23	dl1	Right, honey?
24	R	...Hmph.
25	3	Come on, talk to us, Gray.\nCommunication! You must've\nheard of it at least?
26	dl1	I know he looks like a right grump,\nbut he's a good bloke really.
27	dl1	That furrowed brow comes\nwith age too, I'm sure.
28	R	...Do I have to endure this much longer?
29	3	Hehe, now I get it...
30	3	I did wonder how a guy like Gray\ncould cope in a place like this...
31	3	You keep him on the straight and narrow!
32	dl1	Oh dear, you really think so?
33	R	...Hmff.
34	dl1	In any case. Those things you collected\nalso seem to have gone for a walk.
35	R	So in short, you want us to\ntake them back by force.
36	dl1	There you go again, just asking\nfor trouble... No need, I'm sure\nwe can resolve this amicably.
37	dl1	What I wanted to ask you is to collect\nsome more Origin shards.
38	dl1	They're valuable things, and we'll be\nin deep trouble if we run out.
39	dl1	What I wanted to ask you is if you\ncould collect some more.
40	6	Some more of...what, exactly?
41	3	Oh, d'you mean those things\nGray was gathering?
42	dl1	Yes, that's right.
43	dl1	We've got an approximate location,\nso let me give you that first.
44	1	We can handle this, no problem.
45	3	Looks like we're doin' this, G-dawg!\nTime to saddle up!
46	R	Yes.
47	dl1	I'll do some looking myself\nas well, I reckon.
48	R	Don't throw your back out.
49	dl1	That should be my line.\nYou're always so reckless!
50	R	I know, I know.
evt/tq/msg_tq012602f.json

1	R	If she had information to pass us,\nit must have come from Monica.\nThat ought to make it trustworthy.
2	5	Yeahhh, I'm beginning to wonder.\nWe still haven't found a thing yet.
3	1	Mmm... Doesn't seem to be\nanything here, either.
4	3	Doesn't look like it's gonna turn up.\nHow 'bout we just give up and head\nback already?
5	R	...Hrm.
6	3	Oi, Gray, you listening?\nI said-
7	R	...Wait.
8	R	An ambush, eh?
9	3	Huh?
10	aj1	You finally made it, Gray.
11	R	And you are...?
12	aj1	Looks like the info was good.
13	aj1	...We'll have a bit of your time\nif you don't mind!
evt/tq/msg_tq012603f.json
0	4	What just happened here?
1	6	They look vaguely like Lost Numbers...
2	R	Yeah.
3	2	I thought they were supposed\nto be our allies...
4	R	I suspect they're just an irritant,\nsent here to slow me down.
5	3	But who'd want to slow you down...?\nAre they part of that opposing faction\nyou were banging on about?
6	R	...Hrm.
7	1	So then, these soldiers\nwould have to be...
8	R	They're part of Monica's faction,\nno question.
9	R	But even that's got its share of\nradicals like these guys. The ones\nthat like to stir things up.
10	5	Stir up what, though?\nNothing good, I guess.
11	R	Their ultimate objective is the eradication\nof Moebius... But they'll stop at nothing to\nachieve it... That's where the trouble starts.
12	R	They see the key pieces aligned on the\nboard. Even Ouroboros are now in play...
13	R	Now all it would take is to wrench\nthe command from Monica, and\nthe entire City could be mobilized.
14	1	Could they really do that?
15	R	There are ways. Steal enough Levnises\nfrom us, whittle away at Monica's support,\nand soon she'd be wide open.
16	R	Hard to tell exactly how they'll\nmake their move, but it seems they've\ndecided the time is ripe.
17	3	...OK, and what's that got to do\nwith slowing you down?
18	R	Unlike most City folk, I'm a lone wolf. Might\nbe they didn't account for me in their\ncalculations and just...simplified the maths.
19	4	Since Gray's not usually in the City,\nthey would have to get him where they\nwant him, then restrict his movements.
20	3	Ohhh, right. Now I'm with ya.
21	R	You see?
22	3	Uh, hang on, one more thing...\nDoesn't that still seem weird?
23	3	It was Rozana that told us\nto come here, right?
24	4	That's right. And we were ambushed.\nThat would suggest an information leak...?
25	2	...What do you want to do now?
26	R	Hrrmph... Whoever goes up against me,\nthey're getting crushed. That's all.
27	6	And what about Rozana...?
28	R	We're going back to the City.\nCome on, keep up.

19	nl1	Well, that should earn us some time.\nI don't see any outstanding issues.
20	ol1	Rozana's close to the core of the R&D\nteam, and most importantly, she has\nMonica's ear.

12	R	What did Monica have to say?
13	tk1	Um, about that... She actually took an\naway team and went out. Something about\na request from Rozana... Seemed urgent.
14	tk1	I mean, I suppose it must've been,\nto get the boss moving like that...\nI wonder what that's all about.
15	R	No clue.\n...But I'll look into it.
16	tk1	Appreciate it, really I do.\nSomehow I don't feel like sticking\nmy neck out myself, here...
17	1	Gray, do you know where\nRozana could be?
18	R	I haven't the faintest idea.
19	3	You seem real relaxed for someone\nwhose partner's missing, pal...
20	4	She made Monica leave the City,\nand tried to go outside herself, too...\nThat does feel rather odd.
21	4	Furthermore, Rozana should be aware of\nthe dangers that await a non-combatant\non the outside...
22	2	Right? And if there was something she\nneeded from beyond, couldn't she have\njust asked Monica?
23	3	Well? You wanna contribute or what?
24	R	...Whatever the case may be,\nRozana's tough. She'll be fine.
25	3	Huh?
26	R	I don't know where she went,\nbut I can think of a few people who might.
27	1	Well then, shall we try asking them?\nThat might be the quickest way.
evt/tq/msg_tq012606t.json
0	R	Got a question for you.
1	fl1	Nice to see you too, Gray.
2	2	Rozana's missing.\nKnow anything?
3	fl1	Hm, Rozana? Well, she hasn't been here,\nI can tell you that much.
4	R	Look, I know you've had dealings with her.\nTell me what you know.
5	fl1	You trying to make a point or something?\nI just owed the girl a debt, that's all.
6	R	What kind of a debt?
7	fl1	...Oh for the love of the Founders...\nFine, I'll tell you. Got a feeling you won't\nleave me alone until I do.
8	fl1	I got in some trouble with the hardliners\nsome five years ago, all right?
9	fl1	Their leader, Broo, gave me\na real good thumping...
10	fl1	But Rozana stepped in and made\nthe bastards leave me be.
11	fl1	Anyway, since then I've been greasing\nwheels for her a little, here and there.
12	R	...I see.
13	fl1	Once, I even rustled up some medicine\nshe said she needed...
14	R	The hardliners again...
15	fl1	Come to think of it, why was Rozana\neven around that time...?
16	fl1	It's always kinda bothered me, to be\nhonest...
17	fl1	I don't know exactly what they'd been\nplanning, but they sure were about to\nwreak merry havoc on this place.
18	fl1	I'm definitely grateful to Rozana,\nfor that if nothing else, but yeah,\nthat's about the size of it...
19	R	Do you know where the hardliners are?
20	fl1	I could say I don't, but I doubt you'd\nlisten. ...Oh go on then, I'll tell you.
21	fl1	One place is on the edge of Ribelly Plaza.\nI don't know the exact location, but they\nlike using that area a lot.
22	fl1	Another's in the Great Sword Passage...\nAlthough I have to say I'm not sure if\nthat one's like a room or what...
23	fl1	Other than that, I suppose there's...\nMitia Lookout, maybe? You can see\nacross the whole City from there.
24	fl1	As long as they can't make any big moves,\nI expect they'll be in hiding.
25	R	Understood.\nThat's enough.
26	fl1	I can imagine what you're\ngoing through, you know...
27	fl1	But she's a stubborn one, that girl.\nYou couldn't rein her in if you tried...
28	R	Hmph. I didn't ask for your opinion.
evt/tq/msg_tq012607t.json
0	R	I need to ask you something.
1	el1	Friend mean about Rozana?
2	R	That's right.
3	el1	Rozana apparently been busy lately.\nDrumdrum not seen her for three days.
4	el1	Shame, would have liked to spend\nmore time tinkering with Automaton.
5	1	An Automaton?
6	el1	That right. Had to regulate\nsettings on some Automaton.
7	3	Gray, did you know about this?
8	R	...I didn't. Haven't even heard.
9	R	So, this Automaton you regulated.\nWhere is it now?
10	el1	Drumdrum know it in hidey place,\nand not know any more than that.
11	2	You were working on an Automaton,\nbut you don't know where it was?
12	el1	Drumdrum told it question of trade secret.
13	el1	Had to walk to place with eyes covered.\nDrumdrum think, was still in City, but\nmaybe on very tippy-edge...
14	R	Got it.\nThat'll be all.
evt/tq/msg_tq012608t.json
0	kl1	Oh my... Now there's a face\nI haven't seen in a while.
1	R	I have a question for you.
2	kl1	Well that's unexpected.\nTell me, what do you and I\nhave to talk about?
3	R	Do you know where Rozana is?
4	kl1	Rozana? ...No, I don't believe I do.
5	kl1	She's not like the rest of us, that girl.\nWe don't have very much in common.
6	2	What do you mean, exactly?
7	kl1	Oh, you know. Her way of thinking,\nit's not really compatible with ours.
8	kl1	She's the kind of child who'll do anything\nto get her way, is little Rozana.
9	R	Enough chit-chat.\nIf you don't know anything,\nthen we're done here.
10	kl1	Now, is that any way to treat\nyour elders? So callous, Gray.
11	R	Come off it, I'm old enough to be\nyour brother. I wish you wouldn't\nwaste my time.
12	kl1	Saucy as ever.
13	kl1	All right, so listen here. I don't know\nwhere she is, but I can tell you a\nfascinating little tidbit.
14	kl1	Rozana happens to have some\nconnections with my people.
15	R	...You mean the conservatives?
16	kl1	Being a doctor ought to make one\nimpartial, but that rule isn't as reliable\nthese days...
17	kl1	So we've had to accept medicine\nfrom the girl, at times.
18	kl1	And at times, we've been known to\nfeed her a few scraps of information.
19	R	...I get the picture.\nThat's enough.
20	kl1	I'll say again, Rozana is a good girl,\nbut she's also a girl who puts her ends\nfar above considering her means.
21	kl1	You have to keep a tight rein on\nthose types, or you never know\nwhat they might get up to.
22	R	...Hrm.
evt/tq/msg_tq012609f.json
0	4	Let's sum up what we've learned.
1	4	First, we know Rozana tried to send\nGray and Monica out of the City.
2	1	And we heard she tried to\nleave it herself as well.
3	2	But it seemed unexpected for\nRozana to try and go outside...
4	4	It could have been a message of some\nkind.
5	5	A message?
6	4	A message. To convey the fact that she\ndidn't leave the City, for instance.
7	3	So, what... You think she was\ntrying to tell Gray something?
8	4	We can't discount the possibility.
9	4	She may have already become involved\nin some difficulties at that juncture.
10	6	Hey, those, uh, "hardliner" guys\nthat attacked us... You think they're\nconnected?
11	R	Their goal is to eradicate Moebius.\nI wouldn't put it past them to get\nCity people involved.
12	4	To my eyes, that's something to consider.
13	3	Back up a sec. Rozana has no way\nto fight, right? So why's she going\nagainst the hardliners?
14	4	That's a good point. Additionally,\nshe was also said to have connections\nto the conservatives...
15	1	Right, yeah... There is that...
16	4	Of course, she might just have personal\nfriends who happen to fall on both sides.\nThat wouldn't be so strange.
17	4	But that fact does strike me as somewhat\ncalculated, even mercenary. Gray, do you\nhave anything you can tell us?
18	R	I don't know how she got involved in\nall this. But Rozana, she'll do whatever\nit takes.
19	R	When she's set on something,\nthere's no stopping that woman.
20	R	If her connections to another faction can\nserve as the means to her end, there's no\ndoubt in my mind she'll make use of them.
21	3	I guess she did send us on\nthat wild Medooz chase...
22	3	Do we think she's in league with those\nhardliners, and that's why she tried to\nget us snuffed out?
23	R	It's possible.\nWouldn't put it past her.
24	5	Well, then what the spark are we\nnattering on for here?!
25	2	Right... Perhaps we should start\nchecking the places where the hardliners\nare rumored to hang out?
26	3	Nice idea, but going by that doctor,\nI doubt they're all gonna be neatly\ncooped up in one place.
27	6	Should we just go over them\none by one then?
28	4	That doesn't strike me as realistic.\nThere's no telling when they might\nmake their move.
29	1	Speaking of which, I'm worried by\nthe mention of an Automaton...
30	2	Yeah... If those things get\ndeployed inside the City...
31	R	Then we deal with those first.
32	6	But we don't really know where they\nare...?
33	3	Lessee... The doctor gave us\nthree suspected locations.
34	4	True. Annoyingly, there are multiple\npossibilities for the location of their\nhideout.
35	5	...Well, let's start with wherever's\nmost likely then, I guess?
36	R	No need.
37	R	The places the good doctor gave us\nwere meant to pinpoint the hardliners'\nstronghold.
38	R	And the Nopon Drumdrum provided a hint\nto the Automaton's location.
39	3	Ahh, gotcha.\nIf we put those clues together...
40	R	Exactly. We can discount the place\noverlooking the City, as well as the\nRibelly Plaza area.
41	R	Just an educated guess, but if I was\ngoing to hide an Automaton anywhere,\nit would be the third place.
42	3	Then what are we waiting for?\nLet's get our arses over there!
evt/tq/msg_tq012610f.json
0	ol1	How are we looking out there?
1	nl1	Monica's still gone, but Gray's back\nwith Ouroboros, looks like.
2	ol1	That guy really doesn't know\nwhen to quit...
3	nl1	Still, if we can just disrupt the\ncommand chain, everything else\nshould fall into place, right?
4	dl1	Finally, our toy will have its day?
5	nl1	Of course. It's high time we got to use\nthis thing, and I couldn't think of a better\nopportunity.
6	dl1	Oh, yes. She turned out\nexactly as I'd hoped.
7	ol1	...You're a sly one, aren't you?\nGetting people to accept you,\nthen using them as you like.
8	dl1	...I'm sorry, what?
9	ol1	Skilled technologists from R&D always\nhave to be...managed, to a degree.
10	ol1	We've watched you closely, and you've\nnever leaked info about our actions to\nanyone.
11	nl1	You've helped us come this far.\nRegardless of the results, you've\nmade your bed as our accomplice.
12	dl1	You're still not making any sense.\nYou think the plan's going to fail?
13	nl1	I don't intend to let this opportunity pass\nme by. Whatever happens, I'll leave my\nmark on this City. I promise you that.
14	dl1	This is our chance to gain the upper hand\nin one fell swoop. No need to get gloomy.
15	nl1	Yes. That's exactly it.
16	ol1	We'll have Ouroboros in our hands,\nand we won't have to fight them...
17	ol1	No more hiding. No more biding our\ntime. No more taking anyone's crap...\nThat stuff's for the birds.
18	nl1	Guernica, Monica...\nThey're too soft by half.
19	ol1	We'll cause a disturbance in the City,\nthen use the confusion to steal away\nall the Levnises... Brilliant!
20	ol1	With Monica gone, now's our window.\nWe'll suppress the military and have them\nhand over the leadership.
21	nl1	Once we bend Ouroboros to our\ncommand, all we have to do is\nsquish Moebius under our thumb.
22	dl1	You think they'll ally themselves with us,\neven after we cause all this ruckus?
23	ol1	Bah... They're just a bunch of kids.\nThey'll be putty in our hands.
24	dl1	Right... Yeah...
25	dl1	"Putty in our hands" indeed...

5	3	Wh-?! Sure there is!\nYou're not gonna let these clods make fun\nof you AND have the last word?!
6	R	Hrmph...

8	nl1	If you're here, I assume it's because\nyou've figured out our plan.
9	ol1	Looks like we'll have to get rough.\nOr are you gonna sit there like\na good pooch and lick yourself?
10	R	Eh... I'm not that flexible.
11	R	First, I'll kill you.
12	R	You, I'll keep alive for now.\nMight still kill you later if you don't\ntell me anything worthwhile.

3		Oh, didn't I tell you?
4		There's a power threshold.
5		Like a maximum?
6		It's an interesting system.
7		Little Drumdrum and I incorporated it.
8		...So now you decide to turn on us?
9		You'll wish you hadn't done this!
10		No...
11		I haven't betrayed anyone at any point.
12		It seems to me it's completely\nslipped your minds...
13		When you were all acting\nso fishy five years ago...
14		It was me who broached the subject to you,\nwhen you roughed up the doctor back then.
15		You don't remember?
16		And the conservative leader, Garrett...\nWho put you in touch with him? Me again.
17		We'd round up all the unsavories,\nand toss the trash all at once.

1	6	Me too...
2	3	Even you thought so, right?
3	R	Why would I?
4	3	Uh, those shady dealings for a start?\nThey didn't set off any alarm bells for ya?
5	R	Hrmm...
6	dl1	Honey, d'you realize people\ncan't read your mind?
7	R	I told you not to throw your back out.
8	dl1	Not what I was talking about.\nBut I'll bite - you really can't\nstop being reckless, can you?
9	R	We're all still alive. I don't think\nthat counts as reckless.
10	R	Now, Guernica...\nHe's the one who was reckless.
11	R	But then again, even his actions\nmay well have borne fruit.
12	3	We back to talking in riddles again?
13	dl1	The original idea was for me to stop\nthe hardliners myself, without involving\nall of you in this.
14	dl1	So, I'm sorry.\nI'm sure it was quite a burden.
15	5	I don't get the thinking here.\nSurely you could've just asked\nGray for help in the first place...?
16	dl1	Our opposition would have noticed\nsomething was up. They'd never\nhave lowered their guard like that.
17	dl1	They thought they had me pegged\nas weak; that's what made it easy\nfor them to bring me aboard...
18	dl1	That's basically it.
19	4	...How much did Monica know?
20	dl1	Oh, she knows me.\nWhen I needed her out of the City,\nshe obliged without a single peep.
21	dl1	Some things you have to say out loud,\nand others go without saying.
22	dl1	You know how it is.
23	3	Uhm...\nNah, I really don't...
24	dl1	Haha...\nWell, then one day you will.
25	3	Huh... One of those things, is it?
26	R	Yep. Better get used to it.
27	3	...Hrm.
28	3	...Wh-what?
29	R	The point of us old-timers is to keep\nyou youngsters on the right path.

0-33	Who decided to bring their kid\nover to the workplace?
0-34	This is a depot we're talking about.\nIt's no place for kids to be running\nround and playing, is it?
0-35	I joined the Lost Numbers in the hopes of\nbecoming as fine a man as Guernica.
0-36	In the hopes of becoming as strong and as\nkind as him... And yet, even as of this day\nit still remains an aspiration...
0-37	Those snuffing Agnians are gonna pay.
0-38	You'll get your chance in the next battle.\nSave that energy until then.
0-39	At least our Flame Clock's going\nstrong for now, right?
0-40	Yeah... But it's best not to get too comfy.
0-41	Which colony do you think\nwe're going after next?
0-42	Has to be that lot camped up on\nMelnath's Shoulder. They don't\nmess around, you know.
0-43	Colony Sigma, man. They were lower ranked,\nand yet they still gave us a run for our G.
0-44	Yeah, they were pretty tough\nfor a Dirt-rank colony...
0-45	Guess won't know until tomorrow what the\nrewards from the Colony Sigma battle will be.
0-46	Probably. Here's hoping\nwe'll be well rewarded.
0-47	Oi, this isn't the Special Forces tent.

0-52	Nah, it's an emergency summons.\nLet's hurry on to the assembly square.
0-53	Now power frame is good for going.
0-54	Thanks for that. Now we can show those\nAgnians who they're messing with.
0-55	Hey, Noah. Make sure you send off any\nhusks you find while you're out, OK?
0-56	Do you think I'll survive long enough to\nget a Homecoming?
0-57	Wouldn't count on it, mate, most die long\nbefore. Skill can only get you so far -\nyou also need a fair bit of luck.
0-58	Do we have any teams that went to\nAlfeto Valley on a mission before?
0-59	Would have to be Martha's team.\nWe can send them ahead of the main force.
0-60	Did you see the Consul came\nto the colony earlier?
0-61	You serious? He must've had\nsomething real important to discuss\nwith the commander...
0-62	The commander's been acting eager, huh.
0-63	'Cause the Consul's watching him closely,\nthat's why. Not to mention, the commander\nis already in his ninth term...
0-64	Let's do some monster hunting before\nwe have to set off for Alfeto Valley, eh?
0-65	I'm up for that. Gotta take any chance we\nget to raise our Flame Clock, even if it's\nonly by a bit.
0-66	A royal decree from the Castle? That's\ngotta be a first, right?
0-67	We could get to meet the Queen if we pull\nthis off! ...Eh, best not get ahead of myself.
0-68	I wasn't able to trade in any\nof today's reward for new gear...

0-71	'Course. Just don't bother any Bunnits\nor Garaffas and they won't bother you back.
0-72	Today's mission is just beating up them\nAgnian snuffers, right? ...Oh, it's not?
0-73	Yeah, all right, you might wanna\nsit this one out, big guy.
0-74	I wish I could get my hands on a\nChrome Scarf from the Commissary.\nI'd be able to do all sorts with it.
0-75	If you want it that badly, you'll need to\nbring in a whole lot of materials and\ntrade them for some G.
0-76	Such beautiful sight! So much Levnis\ncause tears of happiness!
0-77	You're pretty hyped for someone who has\nto fix all of these up by yourself...
0-78	With the Collectopaedia, we can know\njust what our friends are looking for.
0-79	Our colony's unity will only grow stronger\nif we help each other out. It's a pretty nifty\nthing, innit?
0-80	This thing's a Velites, isn't it? I never\nthought Colony 9 would get one of them...
0-81	It's still a long way to the target location.\nLet's avoid any unnecessary engagements.
0-82	And let's make doubly sure none\nof the unique monsters spot us...
0-83	I'm the Defender. I take the enemies'\nfocus, then you attack them. What's\nso hard about that?!
0-84	Defenders defend, Attackers attack!\nI did my sparking job, so why don't\nyou do yours?!
0-85	We've still got a little time before we\nproceed with the operation. Get some\nrest while ya can.
0-86	Martha, Martha, do you\nread me? Come in.
0-87	Sparks. I can't pick up their signal. \nMust be all that black fog that's settled\nover the area ahead...
0-88	What on Aionios do you think\nthat ether source could be?
0-89	We'll find out soon enough.\nBrace yourself.
0-90	This mission's going to be different\nfrom what you're used to. Stay sharp.
0-91	I don't believe this! Just as I thought\nwe were about to go to Iron, we drop\nback down to Tin...
0-92	Tell me about it. Still, it could've\nbeen worse. At least we're not Dirt...
0-93	I honestly thought Tin rank would\nget better supplies than this...
0-94	You must be pretty new to\nhow this all works then.
0-95	Man, I wish I could just stuff myself silly\nwith Armu steak right about now...
0-96	I'm afraid it's all flavorless slop\nfor the foreseeable future.
0-97	Our Flame Clock rank doesn't even\nmatter any more. That's what I find\nharder to believe.
0-98	I'm not quite sure how we're going to\nmanage now, with only the supplies we\ngot as Tin rank...
0-99	Things could get even hairier than when\nwe were Dirt rank, I think. We're gonna\nhave some lean times ahead...
0-100	It's a good thing there're so\nmany herbivore monsters out\nhere in Yzana Plains.
0-101	Yeah. If it was full of the types that go\nafter people, we'd never manage to\nfight 'em off in our current state.
0-102	Was that Bunnit meat any good?
0-103	Not good enough for me\nto eat again willingly, no.
0-104	That victory over Colony Sigma feels like\nan age ago now, don't you think?
0-105	Sure does. I'd have never dreamed\nback then that things would turn out\nlike this...
0-106	I know that theoretically, the textbook\ntells you how to raise a crop field, but...
0-107	Yeah, I know. It doesn't assume you'll\n*actually* do it! I mean, there's only\n*two* sparking pages dedicated to it!
0-108	Moebius wrote the textbooks, right?\nThen I'd rather not look at them.
0-109	Don't begrudge the book, mate. We're\nalready weakened as it is, no need- Uh,\nsorry. I think they got to me already...
0-110	Kite's been working very hard recently,\nhasn't he? He's becoming more dependable.
0-111	He's become a fine lieutenant for sure.\nThe colony now feels more organized\nand unified, thanks to him.
0-112	Didja hear? Kite's aiming to\nbecome the next commander!
0-113	He's already nearly in his 10th term\nthough. I'm the one who's gonna\nsucceed Commander Zeon!
0-114	It might not be long before\nOrigin attacks again...
0-115	Thankfully, Colony 9's in a safe spot\ngeographically. Doesn't mean I feel\nsafe personally, though...
0-116	I hear Origin took out colonies\nleft, right and center.
0-117	Those Moebius snuffers still have\nallies out there... Does that mean\nnothing to them?!
0-118	Did Colonies 4 and 30 make it through\nthose attacks OK? They looked pretty\nsnuffing fierce...
0-119	It seems like all the colonies we work with\nremain safe... For the time being, at least.
0-120	Spongy Spuds are so, so good.\nI could eat them by the sackload.
0-121	I know. I can always make\nspace in my belly for them!
0-122	Those Spongy Spuds have been\nputting smiles on everyone's faces.
0-123	We're gonna need to grow a couple\nof extra fields of those Spongy Spuds.
0-124	Those spuds could help bring peace\nto Aionios, they're that good.
0-125	What a privilege it is to be able to gaze\nupon the Queen's noble countenance!
0-126	I was in awe just to get a glimpse!\nIt really reminded me of what\nit is we're fighting for.
0-127	Her Majesty was gracious enough to heal\nmy injuries. I was a blubbering wreck!
0-128	And you've been gracious enough to\ntell me spark knows how many times.
0-129	Long ago, I saw the Queen at a\nHomecoming. Only a glimpse\nfrom afar, but I was still thrilled.
0-130	Now though, I know that was\ndefinitely a fake. I realized it the\nmoment I met the real Queen.
0-131	I'd like it if you could take care of\ntuning up this power frame for me.
0-132	Tummy much too empty to feel\nmotivation for making effort...
0-133	We really don't want Agnus finding out\nabout our moving down to Tin rank.
0-134	They probably know already. I've got\nthe feeling the war is going to get a\nlot tougher for us from now on...
0-135	Refrain from any and all careless\nactions whilst on patrol duty.
0-136	Avoiding injuries is an absolute\nmust. We only have so many\nmedical resources to hand.
0-137	If I knew things were gonna get this bad,\nI'd have gladly requested a transfer to\nColony 16 or wherever...
0-138	Dropping to Tin rank was bad enough. We\ndon't even have a Flame Clock any more.
0-139	Do you think we can get this\nFerronis moving again?
0-140	There still power left in Flame Clock, so small\nmovement possible, but not recommended.
0-141	Honestly, I'd expected Silver-rank Levnises\nto be more capable, you know?
0-142	This scrap metal only worth sigh.
0-143	Just what is up with Noah's sword?
0-144	Not even a Ferronis attack can put a dent\nin a Flame Clock! I guess that sword\nmust be made of something special.
0-145	Nobody wants you here, traitors.\nGet out of my colony, yeah?!
0-146	Just how shameless are they, thinking\nthey can just roll up here now?
0-147	But Noah was a good guy way back\nwhen! He can't be a traitor, it doesn't\nmake any sense...
0-148	Are you dumb or what? He's working\nwith Agnians, for crying out loud!\nHe can't be trusted.
0-149	What's the commander thinking,\nletting in Agnians...?
0-150	I still don't think we can trust\nthat Noah and his little gang.
0-151	I'd still trust them more than that\nmonstrous Consul though...
0-152	There's no need for us\nto fight on any more.
0-153	We weren't that highly ranked anyway.\nI think they've probably done us a favor,\nif anything.
0-154	I've got to thank Noah and his friends\nfor freeing us from the Flame Clock.
0-155	Me too. I was never much of\na fighter to begin with, after all...
0-156	The commander can tell me to start raising\ncrop fields all he wants, I don't even know\nwhere I'd begin...
0-157	I dunno what "crops" even are.\nAre they something I can eat?
0-158	We can't let Zeon be commander any\nlonger. He has to take responsibility for\nthis situation.
0-159	Take responsibility for *what*? He's doing\nthe right thing, and do you really think\nKite would've done a better job?
0-160	Things have finally settled\ndown again in the colony.
0-161	We should be unified now that we\nhave these crop fields to tend to...
0-162	It's a good thing Kite and the others\ncame back when they did.
0-163	You got that right. Colony 9 wasn't\nthe same without them.
0-164	We can't waste time fighting among\nourselves in the colony. We've got to\nfocus on what's happening outside.
0-165	Yeah. The world's still at war as we speak.
0-166	I'm glad all the internal strife is a thing\nof the past now, but you know...
0-167	Yeah, same. Hopefully our hunger\nwill follow suit before long.
0-168	We've been fighting our whole lives to\nraise our Flame Clock rank and make it\nto Homecoming. What do we do now?
0-169	Put our everything into this field thing -\nonly thing we can do, really. I'm not as\ncrazy about it as the commander though.
0-170	Hey, does your Iris still work like it did\nbefore all this happened?
0-171	Yeah. The Flame Clock display is gone, but\nI can still access comms and maps and stuff.
0-172	Zeon becoming commander really threw\nme for a loop.
0-173	Ability talks in Colony 9. He's capable\nand he doesn't mess around, which is\njust what we need.
0-174	I wish Kite had become commander.\nHe would've treated us so nicely, he\nwould.
0-175	It was the Consul who appointed\nZeon, right? I'd say the position's\nup for grabs now!
0-176	This is what the commander asked for.\nA hoe, just like the one in the textbook.
0-177	Doesn't make for a sturdy weapon, but\nit'll make plowing the crop fields easier.\nApparently...?
0-178	Y'know, I've never thought to question\nthe Consuls, until now...
0-179	Weird, right? Like they were some higher,\nuntouchable beings... Didn't stop me\nwondering what they looked like, though.
0-180	If what Noah and his gang's saying is\ntrue, then we can't trust the Consuls, or\nthe Castle.
0-181	But then, what about the Queen...? That\nwould mean she's being used by those\nmonsters, wouldn't it?
0-182	If the Queen was just a fake\nall along...what did we spend\nall that time fighting for...?
0-183	I'm just thankful Noah opened our eyes\nand saved us. Our new lives are all about\nthe crop fields.
0-184	Noah and them lot's antics got our old\ncommander dismissed, but...I personally\ndidn't mind the guy, you know...?
0-185	Same here. He felt dignified, imposing\nand dependable, didn't he?
0-186	Noah's really got a talent for playing\nthat flute. Makes me wish he could\nstay in Colony 9...
0-187	I guess... But him and his friends have\ngot things they need to do. It wouldn't\nbe right to keep them here.
0-188	Url's stopped doing off-seeings, right? Now\nwhat happens if one of our comrades dies\nin battle?
0-189	Who knows? But it's made it clear we\nought to think about this stuff, like how\nimportant an off-seer's duty really is.
0-190	I hear the Special Forces peeps have\nbrought us a whole bunch of spare parts.
0-191	And I'm proper grateful. Now I can finally\nget started on the Levnis maintenance.
0-192	Noah's party brought some supplies.\nIsn't that sweet of them?
0-193	"Sweet"? What a load of crap.\nThey're the ones that caused this\nmess in the first place!
0-194	Well, so much for Fox, then. And I actually\nheld out some hope for him...
0-195	This colony doesn't need us any more.\nLet's go talk to Kite about it.
0-196	I see Fox chatting to Camilla pretty much\nevery day. He looks kinda tense, not\ngonna lie...
0-197	I've noticed too... He's got a different vibe\nabout him compared to before. Something\nto do with the Flame Clock, perhaps?
0-198	I saw Noah and them bring some\nsupplies over to Camilla.
0-199	What a help they've been. Still, only way\nwe can move on from this situation is to\nsolve the problems at the very core...
0-200	Kite and Trish have been stockpiling so\nmany supplies for us. I need to thank them.
0-201	Yeah. Those two have been much more\ndependable than our current commander\nfor a while now.
0-202	Kite and the others may be back, but\nthis potato field is looking well grim.
0-203	We have to try them first before we pass\njudgment. I'm sure they'll be just fine.
0-204	Urrrgh... My stomach feels\nlike it's full of Grebels...
0-205	I knew something was up\nwith those potatoes...
0-206	I've got high hopes for this\nnext batch of spuds.
0-207	They certainly do look scrumptious.\nCan't wait to try them!
0-208	We've gotta show our thanks to\nColony Tau. They're the reason we\nwere able to grow such nice taters.
0-209	Then let's give them some of those spuds\nas thanks, how's that sound?
0-210	Colony 9 finally has enough food\nto comfortably live on now.
0-211	And we've only just gotten started. We're\ngonna need to keep growing a whole lot\nmore of those Spongy Spuds.
0-212	I'm glad Zeon is our commander.\nHe hasn't put a foot wrong.
0-213	Yeah. We've got to keep supporting\nhim however we can.
0-214	It's so cool that Spongy Spuds are now\nspreading to other colonies.
0-215	I could never have imagined it not too\nlong ago. After all, we were almost\nabout to starve to death...
0-216	I decided to volunteer for watch duty\nso no monsters can walk up and nick\nour potatoes.
0-217	We could all learn a\nthing or two from Kite.
0-218	Those Spongy Spuds have helped\nus get Colony 9 back on its feet.
0-219	Yeah! If we still had a Flame Clock,\nyou bet we'd about Silver now!
0-220	I heard Eilis met up with Mwamba.\nHe's still very much the same\nperson, apparently.
0-221	I'm sure it was difficult for her, but it's\nultimately a good thing she got to see him.\nSparks, I'd like to meet him myself!
0-222	We've got a lot of faith in you, Noah.\nGo and show Moebius who's boss!
0-223	You can fight on knowing\nthat Colony 9'll be just fine.
0-224	This next battle's truly gonna be the\nlast one we'll ever fight, isn't it?
0-225	'Ere, be sure to grab a spud for the road.
0-226	That new guy Garvel hasn't shown\nany appreciation for the courtesy\nwe've extended him.
0-227	Got that right. Still, he's an acquaintance\nof Kite's or something, so we should look\nat this a little more long-term.
0-228	I think Garvel, Layla and Hoope are all\nstarting to open up little by little.
0-229	That's good. Kite will be\npleased to hear that.
0-230	Garvel and the newbies are really\npulling their weight around here.
0-231	They sure know how to plow a field, too.\nI say we can safely think of them as\nColony 9 people now.
0-232	Those supplies from\nColony Iota just came in.
0-233	I appreciate it. We've got to\nreturn the favor someday.
0-234	Colony 9 can't catch a break either...
0-235	They're surrounded by Agnus, aren't\nthey? They'll be done before long.
0-236	So with the fields... We'll be able to\neasily harvest our own food if we take\ncare of them properly right?
0-237	It's not going so great right now...\nWe're gonna be in trouble if it\ncarries on like this.
0-238	My insides... Urgh...
0-239	Oh, not you too?! I told you\nnot to eat those stupid spuds.
0-240	So much for Zeon's little experiment.\nWhat got hold of him, thinking we could\ngrow our own food...
0-241	Wouldn't we all have been growing our own\nfood ages ago if it really was that simple...?
0-242	I feel for the poor snuffers that ate them\nemetaters... But on the other hand!
0-243	Think about its potential as a weapon!\nIf Agnus were ever to raid us for food,\nehehehe...
0-244	I asked Url to do an off-seeing,\nand he had the cheek to tell me\n"How about later?"
0-245	I sternly reminded him of what his job is.\nYou wouldn't hear that kind of talk coming\nout of Noah now, let me tell you.
0-246	I can't stand having to leave\nmy dead friends behind on the\nbattlefield. Just awful...
0-247	Oh hey, why, if it isn't you, Noah!\nCome talk to me later, it's about\nthe off-seer situation.
0-248	A girl in my team couldn't get seen off,\nand now she's just lying there in a tent...
0-249	Same thing happened to me. We can't\nlet bodies keep piling up like this...
0-250	Noah's back. How about having him do\nall our off-seeing in place of Url again?
0-251	I don't think Kite'll be too pleased\nabout it, to be honest...
0-252	Just how long has it been since Url\nactually performed an off-seeing?
0-253	Huh, yeah... I don't think he's\ndone one at all, not since we were\nfreed from the Flame Clock...
0-254	We're running out of supplies\nacross the board. Zeon's got to\nfind a solution, and fast.
0-255	And the first thing he has to solve is the\nfood shortage. Hunting and harvesting isn't\nproducing enough for us to live on.
0-256	It's not just me, right? The portions at the\ncanteen *have* been getting smaller, right?\nI don't know how much more I can take...
0-257	When are these fields gonna produce\nanything we can actually eat?
0-258	The amount of broken Levnises we've\ngot here just keeps on going up. Imagine\nwhat'd happen if were attacked now...
0-259	And it's not like we had that many\nLevnises anyway, thanks to our rank going\ndown. I can only hope things'll be all right.
0-260	Is your power frame\nstill not fixed yet?
0-261	It's not like there's even any parts I could\nget from Camilla's to fix it anyway.
0-262	Welp, looks like it's finally\ngiven up the ghost...
0-263	Right then, let's bring it on over to Harala's\nplace. She'll take in anything for resources.
0-264	We'll be fine, I'm sure. Fox and the others\nwill solve the food shortage soon enough.
0-265	If Fox is gonna raid other colonies for\nsupplies what happens when he runs\nout of places to steal from...?
0-266	I've had it with hunting and harvesting!!!\nDoes Zeon actually care about solving the\nfood shortage or what?
0-267	Fox's been coming by a lot lately. It's also\nreally helped to reduce the amount of\nsoldiers making stupid requests to Camilla.
0-268	Haven't seen Kite and the others\naround these past few days...
0-269	Didn't you hear? They got into\na war of words with Zeon, then\nstormed out of the colony.
0-270	Kite's been having issues with how Zeon's\nbeen doing things for a while now. He may\nvery well not come back.
0-271	Kite's supposed to be lieutenant, and yet\nall he ever does is oppose everything the\ncommander does... For spark's sake...
0-272	But you know what? This time, I actually\nagree with him for once.
0-273	I'd say Kite and Eastman have done all of\nColony 9 a favor by leaving. It'll save us a\nwhole lot of trouble .
0-274	Wait, I thought Fox had\nstayed behind, though...
0-275	Kite was always so thoughtful\nabout his friends, wasn't he?
0-276	The fact that's he left Colony 9\nstill hasn't sunk in...
0-277	Those Spongy Spud things... They're\ndelish! So much so, that I wonder if it's\nalmost lunch time all the time now.
0-278	It's my turn for field tending duty. Usually,\nI'd want to be out fighting, but knowing\nhow tasty those spuds are, I'm pumped!
0-279	Thanks to these Spongy Spuds, I'll never\nneed to wake up hungry again.
0-280	I feel like they've made me healthier now,\ntoo. Though maybe that's due to the extra\nsleep I've been getting.
0-281	Imagine that - being able to end the day\non a full stomach without eating food\nthat came from the Castle...
0-282	Ugh, my poor growling stomach... Not in\nmy worst nightmares did I ever think I'd\nbecome so starved for food.
0-283	The rations barely fill you up at all...\nI don't even care about taste, I just wish\nI could stop feeling hungry for an hour...
0-284	So, like, for one of my recent lunch boxes,\nI put in a Thousand Carrot that I shaped\nlike a little star!
0-285	Aww! That sounds so cute!\nI'd love to have that in my lunch box!
0-286	I am *so* done with eating fish...\nThey're just not meant to be eaten\nevery single day, man.
0-287	I'm no good with Fluffy Cloud Ears.\nThey just look so unappetizing...
0-288	The disappointing thing is that if they\nlooked just the tiniest bit cuter, I think\nI'd actually find them palatable, you know?
0-289	Man, that's a real tasty-looking\nration you got there.
0-290	I just love how crispy it is! I'd eat them\nall day, every day, if I could!
0-291	I have some hope we can maybe procure\nenough food and energy. Spare equipment,\non the other hand...
0-292	We're lacking in all kinds of resources.\nWhat do we do if it carries on like this?
0-293	The Castle or even the other colonies\nhave dropped emergency supplies in past\nprotracted wars, if I remember correctly?
0-294	Yeah, but I wouldn't count on it this time,\nto be honest with you...
0-295	I know we don't need to fret about the\nFlame Clock any more, but was that worse\nthan all these shortages we're having?
0-296	You think? I don't mind\nit the way it is now.
0-297	Gotta feel for Roald, getting dragged in to\narbitrate over yet another dispute.
0-298	You mean between Lenny and Eastman?\nFelt like Eastman was just probing Lenny\nabout his suspicious behavior, no...?
0-299	What's that you're looking at?\nData from the Cadensia region?
0-300	Yup. Eilis asked me\nto find the data for her.
0-301	One of the Levnises didn't come back...\nAny idea why?
0-302	Uhhh... I think Eilis might've took\nthat one out? I'll look into it later.
0-303	When we went salvaging with Eilis, she\nmet up with a Nopon Caravan.
0-304	They told her that a place called Hope's\nRest had fertile soil for growing plants, but\nit seems pretty far away to be honest.
0-305	I heard Mio managed to save Kyrie\njust as she was being attacked by\na bunch of Kevesi soldiers.
0-306	No big surprise there. She's powerful,\nstylish, kind - she's just about perfect\nin every single way.
0-307	I have to train way, way more\nif I'm going to get stronger.
0-308	Same here. We're the only ones\nwho can protect this colony now.
0-309	If only I could climb up slopes as swiftly\nand gracefully as the commander...
0-310	Not to mention Mio and her team seemed\nto get the hang of it almost instantly.\nThey're truly something else, they are...
0-311	Make sure you eat everything, guys.\nThere's only so much food to go around.
0-312	She's right - we won't be getting any\nhandouts from the Castle any more.
0-313	Huh, so I thought that new lot just got\nreassigned to Gamma, but then all this\nstuff happened, and now I'm just confused...
0-314	Look, don't trouble yourself over it.\nJust do what Commander Teach says,\nand everything will turn out golden.
0-315	After all it took to get our rank to Iron, our\nFlame Clock goes and bites the dust...
0-316	We have to believe in Commander Teach\nand Mio. With them at the helm, we'll get\nthrough this, surely...
0-317	Our Flame Clock may be gone,\nbut what we do hasn't really changed\nultimately, has it?
0-318	We never had any direct contact with the\nConsul, so we're still taking orders from\nthe commander... You're not wrong there.
0-319	I thought the commander and\nthe Consul trusted each other...
0-320	You really thought that? That sparking\nConsul never said a word, though.\nHow do you trust someone like that...?
0-321	A building I've never seen before just\npopped into existence at Captocorn Peak.
0-322	You serious? I'd love to get\na closer look, but I don't think we\ncan climb up to it from here.
0-323	During my first term, I came down to here\nfrom Agnus Castle via Captocorn Peak.
0-324	That brings me back. It's a stone's\nthrow away, yet it feels much more\ndistant nowadays.
0-325	The commander rarely gets angry, if ever.\nBut that can be worrying in its own way...
0-326	That's what gets me - he always gives off\na caring vibe, but at the same time I\nfeel this...sort of...pressure from him.
0-327	Commander Teach is pretty clever,\nasking our new veteran friends to lead\nthe teaching seminars.
0-328	At least it'll mean a break from those\nstupid strict training drills of his for the\ntime being...
0-329	Man, I so wanted to take part\nin those maneuvers.
0-330	Ah, there's nothing we can do about it.\nBesides, what we're doing here is crucial.\nCan't afford to leave the colony empty!
0-331	So what is this mission in\nAlfeto Valley all about, then?
0-332	Rumor has it, there's an as-yet-unseen\nmonster roaming about the place. That's\nwhy Mio and others are here too.
0-333	It's been so nice lately, not fighting with other\ncolonies. Suppose we have the commander\nto thank for that, don't we?
0-334	But what if we've just been lucky?\nIf Keves were to attack right now,\nthen us trainees would be toast...
0-335	You think Schoon will be all right\non her own? Off-seers are supposed\nto work in pairs, right?
0-336	Mio and her group came back safe,\nbut I fear the worst for Miclan...
0-337	The Flame Clock's gone, but\nour marks haven't gone with it...
0-338	We've still got more'n seven terms left,\nso what're we supposed to do till then...?
0-339	The Commander's going to have a go at\nus if we don't shape up. Time for another\nround of close-quarters combat training!
0-340	Great. Mio and her team come back, and\nthe only thing in your eyes now is fire...
0-341	It'll be open field battle training pretty soon.
0-342	But we've been killing loads of monsters\nfor ages now. Do we really need to bother\nwith all this, still?
0-343	That's training done and over with.\nNormally we'd start preparing for\nthe next lot of rookies, but... You know.
0-344	It'll suck not having a new cohort of trainees\naround to help us, but we're the only ones\nright now that can protect Gamma.
0-345	Your Blade's a spear, right? You're\nsupposed to spike enemies with it!
0-346	I can't do that if you don't do your job\nas a Defender and bait the enemy out!
0-347	Let's go over our chain attack\none more time. We need to be able\nto pull it off cleanly in one go.
0-348	Shouldn't we also look over our gems\nwhile we're at it? They'll make us way,\nway more awesome.
0-349	If we're gonna be real soldiers, then we've\ngotta muscle up. That's what Sena tells us,\nall the time.
0-350	Well, *Taion* says that no amount of\nmuscling up will count for anything if you\ndon't understand battle strategy first...
0-351	I've got more used to piloting a Levnis,\nthanks to your instruction.
0-352	Avis are made for close quarters, so it\nsuits an Attacker like you way more.
0-353	Apparently last-gen Ferronises were\nequipped with supply-producing\nfabricators.
0-354	I read that in the textbook too.\nWonder if there's any of those\nstill out there...
0-355	Keves may be advancing on us, but they\nshould be passing through Alfeto Valley,\nwhich puts us at an advantage.
0-356	That said, if they come at us over the top\nof Melnath's Shoulder, we'll be the ones\nin a tight spot...
0-357	We don't have a Flame Clock any more...\nWhat the spark'll happen to us now?
0-358	Well, whatever does happen, at least\nwe don't need to worry about our\nflames running out, right? That's something.
0-359	I'm so glad Mio and her team made it\nback alive. I was starting to think they\nwere done for.
0-360	I know... Same can't be said\nabout Hackt's team though...
0-361	I'm happy that Mio's team are back, but\nI've got to wonder what's in store for us\ngoing forward.
0-362	I'm sure Commander Teach has a plan.\nHe's always done what's best for us so far,\nso I've no reason to doubt him now.
0-363	With Commander Teach and Mio\nworking together, things are already\nlooking up for Gamma!
0-364	Being rid of the Flame Clock really does\nfeel like a sign of good things to come.
0-365	Who're those guys standing next to Mio?
0-366	Beats me...
0-367	You know, maybe those\nKevesi aren't so bad?
0-368	Yeah, I mean, they destroyed our\nFlame Clock, and they certainly *seem*\nlike good people. But who knows...
0-369	Of all the things the commander has\nordered us to do, trusting Kevesi has to be\nthe craziest one yet.
0-370	Or do you think this is some kinda\nunderhanded scheme on their part?\n...We need to keep our eyes on them.
0-371	What in the flying spark is an Origin,\nand what's it for? I don't get it...
0-372	Well then, start getting it! It's what\nour mentors are fighting against,\nand they need us at our best.
0-373	Origin might just attack us\nagain, mightn't it?
0-374	It's a distinct possibility, yes. We'll have to\nprepare ourselves for an upcoming attack.
0-375	They can't just throw us into a real-life\nbattle. We haven't even finished our\ntraining schedule yet!
0-376	Well, if you've got breath spare for whining,\nhow about doing ten laps round the colony?\nThat'll set your priorities straight.
0-377	Looks like the commander's plan is to\nhave the Kevesi instruct us as well.
0-378	You really think those lousy mudders\ngot anything to teach *us*...?
0-379	Gah, we got so close during training. Just a\nlittle more and we would've beaten them...
0-380	Where did you get that idea from? They\ncompletely wiped the floor with us.
0-381	Foots's squad's got way more cohesive\nlately. Before, you got the impression that\nthey just kinda did whatever.
0-382	Well, they can thank their mentors\nfor drilling that team cohesion right\ninto their bones.
0-383	I heard Kyrie fought together with the\ncommander to defeat a Kevesi soldier.
0-384	You mean *that* Kyrie? Maaan, she's\ngot some grit about her, huh? Not that\nyou'd tell by looking...
0-385	I thought I'd finally earned some recognition\nafter that large-scale training session...
0-386	But we've still got a ways to go\ncompared to our mentors. The\nhard work's only just begun.
0-387	We may not have achieved the objective\nin that large-scale training, but I think we\nmade a good effort of it.
0-388	I feel Mio's team and the commander are\ntruly helping us get even stronger.
0-389	I'd really like to go to Colony 9\nif I ever get the chance.
0-390	That's the colony Noah's team is from,\nright? It would be cool to see what people\nin my term are like over there.
0-391	That was a frustrating training session...\nI really thought we'd nailed that ambush.
0-392	We're not quite there yet. We'll need to get\neven more serious about our training if we're\ngonna get stronger, like the veterans.
0-393	I found a Ferronis hulk at a corner of\nEverblight Plain when we went there\nfor that major training exercise.
0-394	I saw that too. I was going to report to\ncommand, but given the whole Kyrie\nthing, it didn't feel like the right time...
0-395	Have you seen Foots's squad?\nThey look completely knackered.
0-396	Looks like a certain someone's training did\nthem in. But hey, if it gets them fighting\nbetter, that's what counts, right?
0-397	Apparently Sena's weight training will have\nyou all buffed up in three days flat.
0-398	But you heard how agonizing it was for\nFoots's squad, right? I'd get chewed up\nquicker than an Armu meatball...
0-399	I heard Zakir's squad is\nbeing instructed by Taion.
0-400	Well, there's no one as knowledgeable in\nGamma as Taion. I'd have really wanted\nin on that seminar too.
0-401	Noah's giving our next lecture, apparently.\nI've heard he's real good at making things\neasy to digest and understand.
0-402	Oooh, really?\nHe has my attention, then.
0-403	So, apparently, Noah and Zakir had a little\nfriendly competition during the lecture...
0-404	I heard about that! That's so like\nZakir, you know. The guy's so\nstubborn and serious.
0-405	You know Schoon? She got taught all kinds\nof things by that Kevesi off-seer.
0-406	Silent waters, eh? Don't think\nI'd have had the guts to go through\nwith something like that...
0-407	Whatever happens to me, I can rest easy\nknowing that Schoon is doing well again!
0-408	Whoa now, don't go getting yourself seen\noff, you hear me? You better make sure\nyou've got a long, happy life ahead of you!
0-409	There goes Namuki again, off in his own\nlittle world, muttering to himself.
0-410	That's just what he's like.\nPay it no mind.
0-411	I know Namuki said that there were people\nin Keves with wings on their head, and\nthese oddly rugged folks, but you know...
0-412	When you take a closer look, we've also\ngot our odd little differences. Like, our ears\nare in different places, things like that.
0-413	Captain Kyrie ain't exactly captain-like,\nbut I think that's actually to her benefit,\nyou know?
0-414	You can talk to her about pretty much\nanything, and you really build up a sense\nof kinship with her over time, don't you?
0-415	I wish Mio could've taught me.\nSpark's sake.
0-416	We'll get our chance the\nnext time round, trust me!
0-417	Maybach... That was his name, I think?\nSomeone said he came from Colony 4.
0-418	He's doing a lecture for people\naiming to become medics. I'm kinda\ninterested, personally.
0-419	If we're going to have special lectures,\nit'd be good to invite as many people as\npossible to give them, wouldn't it?
0-420	Let's try bringing it up with Commander\nTeach next time we meet him.
0-421	All these revelations about\nthe Consuls and the Flame Clocks\nare a whole lot to take in...
0-422	But Commander Teach wasn't denying it\neither. I don't think we have any choice\nnow but to accept it as the truth.
0-423	Our seniors'll definitely figure\nsomething out, right? They've got to...
0-424	They can tell us our fight is over, but that\ndoesn't mean we're guaranteed to survive...
0-425	The Flame Clock's gone...but\nnothing's really changed, has it?
0-426	Right. It hasn't. Other than that,\nit's business as usual.
0-427	Those Ouroboros or whatever they are\nsure know their way around a Blade.
0-428	They were kind of unreal, weren't they?\nWhat in the ever-loving flames are they...?
0-429	Do you mind doing some repairs\non my power frame as well?
0-430	Course not! Broken power frame\nno good for anyone.
0-431	The Levnises are down, so we're told\nwe'll have to drag stuff around ourselves.
0-432	Even with power frames, that is gonna\nbe a job and a half, I can tell...
0-433	I heard there are some Ferronises\nthat come with a fabricator equipped.
0-434	If we could find one like that, it'd help\nwith our dwindling supply situation,\neven if only a little...
0-435	I saw an old Ferronis gathering dust\nin Dannagh Desert.
0-436	It's busted and won't work anyway, right?\nNo point in even going then...
0-437	Of all the places our Ferronis could get\nstuck in, it had to be slap-bang in the\nmiddle of the wilderness.
0-438	We're lucky there's a water source nearby.\nThis is why I keep telling people, you can\nnever afford to be off the pace.
0-439	We'll need to come up with a plan\nif we're going to make it out here in\nthe Eagus Wilderness.
0-440	We could send some guys over to the\nsouthern Ribbi Flats to widen our\nsupply procurement range?
0-441	Don't go chucking your Levnis\naround the place all willy-nilly.
0-442	Out here in the wilderness, you'll clog up\nthe crevices in the Levnises with sand in\nno time, making our jobs tedious as spark.
0-443	You know the rules - one shower\nevery two days.
0-444	You're telling me to go out there\ncaked in sand?! Snuff my life...
0-445	It's back-breaking work taking out\nall these monsters in the sand, isn't it?
0-446	They're no pushovers either. Volffs, Aspars -\nthe place is crawling with 'em.
0-447	What I'd do to be rid of Volff meat and\nstuff myself with juicy Armu steak...
0-448	Round here, you'll only find Armus in the\nRibbi Flats, and it's prohibitively expensive\nto transport. That's why it's a delicacy.
0-449	You using your Collectopaedia?
0-450	Yeah. Pretty nifty thing, ain't it? I'm kicking\nmyself for not using it more earlier.
0-451	Collectopaedia Cards sure don't take away\nfrom how lacking in supplies we are...
0-452	What you mean, is that our surplus\nsupplies are being spread thin, right?\nAt least there's enough to go around.
0-453	Maybe we can get the Ferronis moving\nagain if we borrow some more Nopon\nfrom Colony 30?
0-454	Throwing Nopon at Ferronis\ndoes not solution make. Fixing\npower transmission is only way.
0-455	I hope we can get the ol' Ferronis\nup and moving again.
0-456	So do I... Funny as it sounds, I long for\nthe days of having my innards shaken\nup by it when it was on the move.
0-457	Hey, did you see that? That massive\nsea vortex just up and vanished.
0-458	Yeah OK, but you saw the massive thing\nthat came out of it, right? Way bigger than\nany Ferronis I've ever seen!
0-459	The Flame Clock's destroyed. The Consul's\nbeen killed. What's the top brass in the Castle\ngonna think of us now...?
0-460	It's a cause for concern, isn't it?
0-461	Is our fight really over now?
0-462	Looks that way. It's all a lot to\ntake in at once though...
0-463	So we're just letting snuffing Agnians into\nthe colony now, no questions asked?
0-464	That's what the commander ordered:\nmake them feel welcome, or else.
0-465	But them lot are Kevesi. What are they\ndoing, banding together with Agnians?!
0-466	Whoa, watch what you're saying...
0-467	I knew that black fog interfered with the\nenemy scouting us out, but I'd never\nguessed it'd work on the Consul too.
0-468	Yeah... But it's pretty rough, not knowing\nwhen an annihilation event might happen\nthough, huh? Probably best steer clear of it.
0-469	Do you think we'll ever grow up\nto be like Commander Ethel?
0-470	Of course not. Not only did she become\nCommander in her third term, she became\nthe youngest to ever reach Silver rank.
0-471	No need to fight for the Flame Clock\nany more, that much is certain.
0-472	However, we still very much have an\nenemy to fight. Every last one of us\nhas to stay on guard.
0-473	We're now free from eternally\nfighting Agnus, yet our marks are\nstill on us like before...
0-474	That must mean we'll still kick the bucket\nat end of term ten. We haven't got long left\nafter all...
0-475	Can't get the Ferronis moving...\nWe'll have to invest in some Levnises\nto use on expeditions.
0-476	But we've only got so many ether\ncylinders. We'll need to spread\nthem out carefully.
0-477	We don't need to worry about our rank\nlimiting our resources any more. Farewell\nDirt rank and hello freedom!
0-478	Is that really something to celebrate?\nI'd say things're worse now than before...
0-479	We've gotta keep this colony safe\nwhile the commander's on her way\nto the Castle.
0-480	Well, with our excellent team captains by\nour side, I think we'll manage just fine.
0-481	Aside from Mixed-Veg Torpedo Wraps,\nI guess we'll have to live off rations for\na while...
0-482	Oh sweet Armu steak... Your rich,\nluscious taste eludes me yet...
0-483	The Consul was playing us like\na snuffing off-seer's flute...\nWhat a piece of work!
0-484	Before now, I thought Consuls only\nkept tabs on us... What the spark was\ntheir objective here?
0-485	All that time and life we spent filling up\nthe Flame Clock... And now it turns out,\nit was all for the Consuls' sake.
0-486	What's the meaning of this? We were\nsupposed to be fighting for the sake of\nthe Queen, weren't we?
0-487	Can you use your Iris OK?
0-488	Yep, no issues here. Seems like\nthe only thing that bit the dust\nwas the Flame Clock.
0-489	I've almost hit my tenth term...\nNot much left in the mark now.
0-490	Not much longer till your Homecoming.\nDon't you dare die on me now.
0-491	The Great Sword is in the Cadensia\nregion. It's a long, long way to get\nthere, so keep yourselves safe.
0-492	Snuff it! How the spark did I\nget chased off by a Volff...?
0-493	Even no good soldier like friend can have\nuse with gem. Give one to friend now.
0-494	Do you know when they expect to be done\nwith the boulder removal on Ribbi Flats?
0-495	It's gonna take a little while longer,\nI suspect. It was some pretty heavy\nrockfall, after all...
0-496	Don't stray too far when exploring\nRibbi Flats. You'll be swarmed by\nhordes of strong monsters if you do.
0-497	How do you fancy going out to explore\nthe Aetia region? We'll stop just before\nreaching Colony 9.
0-498	OK... Let's do it then. Things should be\ncalm enough right now on the war front\nfor it to be safe.
0-499	I requested extra resources from HQ,\nbut I've had no reply so far.
0-500	We'll just have to follow Commander\nEthel's lead and intercept a supply drop.
0-501	That Imogen girl from Colony Tau has\nkind of a breezy personality, huh.
0-502	She sure does give off that vibe.\nWhat on Aionios did she come here\nto study, anyway?
0-503	Imogen told me that Colony Tau grows\nsome really yummy vegetables.
0-504	So they've already become self-sufficient?\nOur former enemies have some foresight,\nI'll give 'em that.
0-505	It's not fair! There was so much more I\nwanted to learn from the commander...
0-506	This is hitting everyone hard, little guy.\nBut we have to keep moving forward -\nit's what she would've wanted.
0-507	Never in my life could I have imagined\nher thing with Cammuravi ending that way...
0-508	I just wish...we could've fought by her\nside... Snuff this cruel world!
0-509	Our Queen was just a mechanical\npuppet this whole time...? It doesn't\nmake any sense.
0-510	That's what all our comrades' lives - all\nthe countless sacrifices - were for...? A fake?
0-511	What do you think, could we work\ntogether with Colony 5...?
0-512	If anyone can help us out, it'd be them.\nLet's consider it further.
0-513	How do we act if Colony 5 decides to\nattack Colony Lambda?
0-514	I'd hate it if we had to fight Colony 5,\nbut we're honor-bound to protect\nColony Lambda.
0-515	When you reach Gold rank, you get wiped\noff the face of Aionios by Moebius...? What\nthe spark is up with that?
0-516	And to think we were just on the\nverge of reaching Gold too...
0-517	Colony 4 was able to rise to Silver rank\nso quickly, yet we never did reach Gold\nin the end.
0-518	And we're lucky we didn't, mate.\nIf we had reached Gold, Moebius\nwould've massacred us all.
0-519	Snuff the Flame Clock. Our common\nenemy here is Moebius.
0-520	Yup. Only way we're felling that giant\nsnuffer in the sea is by fighting\nside-by-side with the other colonies.
0-521	We can't just roll over and die.\nCommander Ethel would never forgive us!
0-522	I'm with you there. Come on, we've\ngot a counterattack to prep.
0-523	We got out of that first wave with zero\ncasualties, but just remember that the\nsecond wave could come at any moment.
0-524	Yes, Captain! I'll get ready right away!
0-525	If one of Origin's attacks lands\na direct hit on us, we'll pretty much\nevaporate, won't we?
0-526	Or to put it simply, there's no hiding away\nfrom this one. May as well fight like spark\nhowever we can.
0-527	Aionios is changing in a pretty big way...
0-528	Now that we've come this far,\nwe have a duty to safeguard\nour world till the bitter end.
0-529	Looks like Noah's lot got rid of that\nmonster horde for us.
0-530	With the tactician squad short on numbers,\nhe's done them and us a huge favor.
0-531	Hmph, so those Agnian mudders are\ntrying to get in our good books with a\nlittle monster clearing, are they?
0-532	Whoa, mind your language. We don't do\nthat kind of discriminating here in Colony 4\nany more, you hear?
0-533	Kevesi and Agnians, working together hand\nin hand towards a better future - that\ncould be our new ideal now.
0-534	Could be, but it's still taking me some time\nto get used to this new state of affairs...
0-535	Noah's team really helped out the tactician\nsquad and, consequently, Colony 4.
0-536	They're basically part of Colony 4 now.\nWe have to recognize them as such.
0-537	Looks like those supplies that were stolen\nare now back at the colony.
0-538	I've almost lost count of how many\ntimes Noah has done us a favor.
0-539	The lieutenant was looking\nreally low back there...
0-540	He idolized the commander more than\nanyone else in this colony. I'm not\nsurprised he's feeling depressed right now.
0-541	The lieute... Oh right, he's the acting\ncommander now, isn't he? Well, either\nway, I'm glad he's feeling better now.
0-542	Me too. He's finally moving on, so we\nhave to join him in doing so as well.
0-543	You know, at first I was like, no way will that\nguy be able to step into the commander's\nshoes, but I'll admit - I've been proven wrong.
0-544	I can rest easy now knowing\nthat there's unity in the colony.
0-545	That stupid Jeremy... Going round\nmaking out like he's gonna get "revenge" for\nMercutio, and "restore his honor"...
0-546	I get what's he trying to say, but he's not\nreally thinking about what Mercutio\nwould've done were he still with us.
0-547	The hostility towards Agnus still lingers\naround here... This can't go on. We have\nto find a way to ease tensions.
0-548	We could invite some Agnians\nover here to encourage some more\ncultural exchange, perhaps?
0-549	We've been short on supplies till now\ndue to our Dirt rank, but if we garrison\nlong-term in Eagus Wilderness...
0-550	...It's going to be even rougher for us now\nthan it was before, I know that much.
0-551	Sounds like the Ouroboros really helped\nout the procurement division.
0-552	Well, that explains why I felt Brunella's\nteam was doing such an unusually good\njob... Not that I'm criticizing them though.
0-553	I can finally eat a halfway filling meal\nthanks to you guys. I appreciate it.
0-554	Agnian Levnises are high quality,\nlow quantity, but Keves's are the\ncomplete opposite.
0-555	It's a good thing Agnus's Levnises are so\nreliable. There's a stupid amount of parts\nneeded for maintaining those things.
0-556	Ymeer's already proceeding with\nthe plan to restart the Ferronis.
0-557	For real? That guy's\na genius, I swear...
0-558	What? Hey, we're one\nEquites short, here.
0-559	Dorin took that one out. He's piloting it\ntogether with Bambam.
0-560	You think Dorin and Bambam\nare still alive?
0-561	Oh, they're just fine. Those lads\nare practically indestructible.
0-562	Dorin and Bambam have really\ngone out to see the world, huh.
0-563	And I was sure they'd chicken out and\ncome back home halfway through... I didn't\nknow them quite as well as I thought.
0-564	I wish I could go and see the\noutside world like Dorin and Bambam\nare doing right now.
0-565	Must be fun going to all those different\nplaces and experiencing all the different\ntasty foods they've got there.
0-566	That guy Fili, from Colony Iota?\nHe just straight up asked me if\nI wanted a meal with him...
0-567	Huh... What's his deal, d'you reckon?\nAngling to hear some Colony 4 secrets,\nor what?
0-568	I wonder how Maybach's doing...
0-569	What kinda place is Colony Gamma?\nCan't wait for him to get back and\nshow off his souvenirs.
0-570	The extra supplies from\nColony Iota have arrived.
0-571	What a relief. We'll need to\nreturn the favor someday.
0-572	It's ridiculous how many monsters are\ncrawling around here... Also, how have the\nwounded still not returned to active duty?
0-573	It was foolish for us to\nset up base here.
0-574	Another monster extermination mission...\nBeen getting a lot of those lately, eh?
0-575	You said it. But with the battle\nsquad always out, the colony's\nalways short of hands.
0-576	The monsters are now even reaching\nBarren Knoll, apparently...
0-577	And one of our guys got attacked\nrecently too, right? We've gotta do\nsomething, and fast.
0-578	The tactician squad\ngot back from recon.
0-579	Right then, guess that means it's\nfinally time for you-know-what.
0-580	Is it true that we now know where the\nmonsters' leaders are hiding?
0-581	Looks like Maxie's entrusted the\nmission to that Ouroboros lot.
0-582	Oh, come off it... Why give\nthe mission to them...?
0-583	The tactician squad managed to\nhunt down a whopper of an Armu!
0-584	Sweet! It's been who knows how long\nsince I've had freshly hunted, natural meat.
0-585	Armus have some very special,\nrare cuts. They're only a tiny part\nof the whole beast, though.
0-586	I'm well aware. They're "first-rate fillets"\nif I'm not mistaken? The kind that just\nmelt on your tongue...
0-587	Looks like we'll be doing pretty good\nfor food for the time being.
0-588	Just when I thought things were looking\nhairy... The procurement division really\nstepped up when it mattered!
0-589	Oi! What's going on with those\nspare parts they promised us?!\nAre they delivering them or what?!
0-590	Nah. We did make the request to the\nprocurement division, but it must've\nfallen on deaf ears...
0-591	We're gonna be running on fumes if we\nkeep this up. Have those new supplies\nstill not arrived yet?!
0-592	I-I apologize. I will go make an inquiry to\nthe procurement division right away.
0-593	Urrrgh... I just wanna eat some juicy,\nfatty Armu meat already.
0-594	Could you please not describe it in all\nthat agonizing detail? You're getting my\nstomach all worked up for nothing.
0-595	Are those procurement guys actually\ndoing their job or what?
0-596	They're not. How else would we\nbe so low on supplies?
0-597	I heard that the Nopon from maintenance\nhasn't come back yet. I'm starting to think\nthey could've gone AWOL.
0-598	That can't be... They wouldn't have\nanywhere to go if they did that.
0-599	Captain Dinzel's fuming again...
0-600	Well, it ain't easy being in the maintenance\nand development team. It's the only place\nthat could make him bellow like that.
0-601	I'm sure you've heard the recon report,\nright? The one about the husks being\nscattered all over.
0-602	Right by Singbreeze Funnel, right? That's\nslap-bang in the middle of monster\nterritory. I pity those poor snuffers...
0-603	What's going to be done\nabout those husks...?
0-604	I really do want to give them a proper\nsend-off, but we'll end up just like them\nif we go out there...
0-605	Getting killed in battle by Agnians is one\nthing, but getting killed by monsters...
0-606	It's the absolute peak of dishonor...\nTruly regrettable.
0-607	Two Equites could take on an Avis just\nfine. But up against a Testudo, we'll need\nthree Equites, no question.
0-608	I guess this is one of those battles that\ncomes down to pure numbers.
0-611	Age of Levnis already upon us. No need\nfor foot soldiers getting bashed up now.
0-612	If so, then I can feel a little more\nat ease. It'll be much safer for us\nfighting in Levnises.
0-613	Tummy growly. Mind if go grab bite\nand stretch wings for little while?
0-614	What? But you're not anywhere\nclose to finishing off your job yet...
0-615	I asked that Nopon to fix the power\nframe... Where the snuff has it gone?
0-616	You know Nopon love to take long\nafternoon naps, right?
0-617	We've got food supplies for\nthe time being, right?
0-618	Oh, you bet we do! There's enough\nArmu nearby to feed the whole colony\nseveral times over.
0-619	I fancy toastie with Armu steak.
0-620	I go with usual fishy fillet.
0-621	If we're talking about escorting a Thorax,\nthat's a four Equites job, minimum.
0-622	Yeah, or one Centuris, and\nwe'd be all set, you know?
0-623	If only someone would go out, scavenge\nus up some Ululas or Lepuses...
0-624	Get real. How many of our Levnises\nwould we have to throw away to get\njust *one* of those things?
0-625	Time for investigate Origin!\nFriends come along?
0-626	First, need build method of conveyance.\nNo can get there otherwise.
0-627	Need 30 day vacation...\nFor go to Great Sea!
0-628	Wait - you want to take time off?\nNow of all times?!
0-629	Repair parts no even close to enough...
0-630	Could friend not get some salvaged from\nrustbucket Ferronis hulks in Rae-Bel\nTableland or Dannagh Desert?
0-631	I found an old Ferronis in Dannagh\nDesert, but it didn't have anything we\ncould use straight away.
0-632	Flame Clock is always first thing\nto get salvaged. Probably not\nmany useful thingies left.
0-633	They say the only way to get to Rae-Bel\nTableland is to climb Elsie's Spout...\nSo I guess I'd need a Levnis, right?
0-634	Actually, the commander managed\nto scale up there just fine.
0-635	I assume the commander set up base in\na quiet place like this to build Dorrick, right?
0-636	Nah, I heard it was the Consul's order.\nThis place is nigh on impregnable, after all.
0-637	Though no Nopon, Valdi very important.\nCommander position wasted on Valdi.
0-638	Yes, yes. Valdi made for tinkering\nLevnises with us Nopon.
0-639	It's great to see the lieutenant\nlooking healthy.
0-640	But he's just pushing himself further than\nhe did before, no? We can't have him\ncollapsing again. The colony needs him!
0-641	I thought the lieutenant would've had a\nweight off his shoulders now that Dorrick\nis finally complete.
0-642	He's started *yet* another project, hasn't\nhe? Still, he seems happy enough to me,\nso I can't really complain.
0-643	Our colony was being run by the Consul\ntill now, right? Are things going to turn out\nall right for us?
0-644	With Yuzet around, I'm sure things'll\nturn out just fine. ...Oh, and I guess\nthe commander's here too.
0-645	Flame Clock busted now. So no need\nfor Colony 30 to fight any more?
0-646	Would seem so. No work for mechanic in\nno-war colony. Does friend want come\nwith to other colony to offer services?
0-647	We'll seriously need to watch our ether\ncylinder supply if we keep losing Levnises\nduring operations.
0-648	I can send someone to look for nearby\nether channels and top us up if we start\nto run low.
0-649	A stubborn grampypon live in\nDannagh Desert.
0-650	But also hear Nopon in desert is littlepon\nthat has many monies. They enigmapon\nindeed.
0-651	Remember when we fought off Colony Iota\nand got promoted to Iron rank?
0-652	Those were the days. They probably shot\nthemselves in the foot more than we drove\nthem back, but I sure wasn't complaining.
0-653	Gambert tell interesting tales.\nMuch info on Agnian Levnis.
0-654	Honorine from Colony Tau\nhas much good traits.
0-655	Welcoming to Nopon, and friendly. Me hope\nshe stay in Colony 30 home for long time!
0-656	Look like Sadadan Brothers went to\nescort Honorine back...
0-657	Such cushy gig...\nGreat trick for get in Colony Tau.
0-658	If pass through Rae-Bel Tableland and\nOld Kana Battlefield above Elsie's Spout,\nyou arrive Pentelas region.
0-659	And then what am I gonna do? Just get\nsome Levnis parts and head back?
0-660	If go straight through Rae-Bel Tableland\nand pass the Dow Dolmen, destination is\nUrayan Trail.
0-661	That war-torn place? I've only got one life,\nand it ain't enough to survive in that\nQueen-forsaken place.
0-662	I love me a Fish-Fillet Toastie. Can't help\nbut want one every time I pass by the\ncanteen.
0-663	It said that cheffypon in age past\ncame up with recipe while noshing on\nyummy Tasty Sausage Toastie.
0-664	When fixing power frame not enough,\nuse of gem is best option.
0-665	Got it. I'll pop in some\nDefender gems then.
0-666	I knew bestest is Valdi! No Nopon\nexist that could build Mechafriend\nall speedy like Valdi.
0-667	Make noggins more smart, and maybe\ncan make Auto-Lev like Agnus!
0-668	Mechafriend is too great an invention.\nMake Nopon feel like failure by comparison...
0-669	Brighten up! You're more than just handy\nwith a wrench, you're good at way more\nthings than you realize!
0-670	Which part in Mechafriend need\nimprovement to allow piloting of\nLevnis?
0-671	Such action require speedy repeat\nanalysis and speedy making of decision.\nMakes for big processing burden.
0-672	To see Pulipuli hacking\nMechafriend is big surprise.
0-673	Unhackable thingies real only in realm of\ndreamy-dreams. Next for doing is\ndeveloping of hacking countermeasure.
0-674	I have to wonder what direction\nthe Aetia region is heading in.
0-675	Shall we dispatch a Levnis squad? It\nwould make it easier to respond in case\nsomething were to happen.
0-676	We may be free from the Flame Clock now,\nbut the reality is that we'll have to be on\nguard against not just Agnus, but Keves too...
0-677	Any Kevesi we spot outside the colony,\nwe'll have to interpret as enemies first,\nto be on the safe side.
0-678	The commander's a mechanic, right?\nBut I ain't seen him out on the frontlines.
0-679	That's 'cause he's a Healer, you doof, and an\nincredible one at that. He's as good at it as he\nis at fixing Levnises.
0-680	I feel less anxious now that we don't\nhave a Consul around any more.
0-681	He was a piece of work, but he was\nalways on-point when it came to battle,\nso at least I felt protected at the time.
0-682	That Michel is too impulsive for his own\ngood. He'd do himself and us a whole lot\nof good if he'd just follow Yuzet's orders.
0-683	Yeah, sure, but, his reckless charges did\nsave me a number of times. Helps to have\na hothead around sometimes, you know.
0-684	Can we really trust Noah and his lot, what\nwith them having barged in and smashed\nup our Flame Clock out of the blue?
0-685	Who knows... But if we're gonna get to\nknow them a lot more from now on, that'll\nmean more opportunities to trust them.
0-686	I feel like See-Mee-Mee's slowly but surely\ngetting better at playing his flute.
0-687	In dreamy-dreams, perhaps.\nFriend's ears starting to go,\nthat is only explanation.
0-688	See-Mee-Mee's flute skills have really\nimproved in leaps and bounds.
0-689	I know. It almost feels like Radek is still\nwith us. I hope See-Mee-Mee sees me off\nwhen I get to my tenth term.
0-690	Erun's group got back safe and\nsound. Heard Noah and the guys\nwere to thank for that.
0-691	And I'm sure you're also thankful that the\nLevnises got back in one piece, aren't you?
0-692	Development's restarted on\nthat massive Levnis, apparently.
0-693	It's called Dorrick, apparently. Looks like\nthe lieutenant's in for another busy patch.
0-694	There's no one in the colony quite as crazy\nabout Levnises as the commander.
0-695	The next one we build won't be for the\nConsul any more, right? I'm actually kinda\nhyped for what the boss will come out with...
0-696	You know the commander's Mechafriend?\nI heard some Nopon nicked its parts and\nhid them someplace.
0-697	So those little fluffballs can have a\nrebellious streak to them too, huh...
0-698	So glad Dinkidinki and Widgewidge\nstill here in colony.
0-699	Role of other Nopon is to watch over them.\nMake sure they not lose way.
0-700	So glad Dinkidinki, Widgewidge and\nPulipuli still here in colony.
0-701	Pulipuli most exceptional.\nWorth 100 otherpon by self!
0-702	Is it true that Colony Iota planted\na secret agent somewhere?
0-703	I thought it was just some dumb Nopon\nacting up... But with Iota's commander,\nyou can never be 100% sure.
0-704	Our commander's been acting more\ncommander-like recently, I'd say.
0-705	So would I. That he's been able to pay\nattention to things that aren't to do with\nLevnises is a real good sign, in my opinion.
0-706	Supplies pretty plentiful lately, no?
0-707	I'll give him his due: I never imagined the\ncommander would be able to negotiate\nwith Colony 4 and Lambda like he did.
0-708	If we run out of Ether along with\nthe loss of the Flame Clock, we're\ncompletely snuffed.
0-709	The lieutenant's got to be harder\non the commander. There's barely\nany ether left to go around.
0-710	It's going to take spark knows how\nmuch ether to get Dorrick development\nup and running again.
0-711	And we've got a whole bunch of colonies\nto thank for bailing us out. We'll have to\nreturn the favor sometime soon.
0-712	The commander just blurted out that he\nwanted to capture some Agnian Levnises.
0-713	I think he's out of his mind, but if it's\nto help complete Dorrick, then I guess\nwe'll try and figure something out...
0-714	I'm starting to kinda get what the\ncommander is aiming for here.
0-715	That's just what a commander would\nthink to do - trying to turn Agnus's\nAuto-Levs over to our side.
0-716	We've completed one almighty\nlooking weapon here. Not sure\nabout the name though.
0-717	I couldn't have imagined we'd be learning\nfrom the City folk, just a few months back.
0-718	Dorrick is finally going to be\ncomplete soon, isn't it?
0-719	Yup, and I'm so excited about it. Everyone\nincluding the commander and the Nopon\nworked so hard to make it a reality.
0-720	Dorrick may be busted, but it was kinda\nspectacular, wasn't it? People from all over,\ncoming together, working together, I mean.
0-721	We'll need to repay the favor someday.\nHelping them out the next time something\nmajor happens would be a good start.
0-722	Actions of Pulipuli utterly unforgivable!
0-723	Agreed. That why now Pulipuli have to run\nuntil charge up equivalent amount of ether\nto what used on Dorrick project. Justice!
0-724	Man, am I glad to be living in Colony 30.\nThere aren't many colonies where Nopon\nsupport their commander this strongly, eh?
0-725	I thought the same when we completed the\nDorrick project. A lot's changed here since\nthe Flame Clock got wrecked, huh...?
0-726	Friend's injuries heal by self. But Dorrick\nnot heal by self like living thing. Pilot must\nbe even more extra careful than usual!
0-727	Of course. I'll be more\ncareful from now on.
0-728	Right, everyone gather powers together\nagain. Dorrick development continues!
0-729	Ohoho!
0-730	Dorrick construction need many more\nmaterials - lots, lots more!
0-731	Must make Valdi and friends\nto gathering many materials!
0-732	Mechafriend is one, Nopon is many.\nIt no threat to Nopon livelihood!
0-733	Enough worry about Mechafriend.\nDorrick construction is focus now!
0-734	Phase five of Dorrick construction is done!\nIt all downhill from here!
0-735	One more big push for last half!
0-736	Dorrick not constructable with no ether.
0-737	Meh-meh-meeeh...
0-738	Help of everyone contribute to Dorrick\nconstruction completion!
0-739	All is appreciated!
0-740	Phase seven over!\nOne last sprint to finish now!
0-741	Well-earned beddy-bye in order soon...
0-742	Knowledge on Agnus Levnis needed\nfor phase nine progression.
0-743	Meh-meh. Valdi a meanie for\npostponing of development.
0-744	Now we develop new weapon for Dorrick!
0-745	Finale approaches!
0-746	Test give Dorrick all-clear! Last step\nis mamapon of all paint job!
0-747	Time to splatty-splat Dorrick\nwith cool colors!
0-748	Next is building faster, punchier,\nblastier Dorrick!
0-749	Meeeeeeh!!!
0-750	The Flame Clock...\nIt's truly no more...
0-751	Time for rejoice. Now not fighting means\nmore time for Levnis-tinkering.
0-752	Our Consul was just using us,\nthis whole time...
0-753	What was all the fighting even for...?
0-754	All that business surrounding the\nFlame Clock and the Consul came\nas a big shock to me...
0-755	It was a shock for me too. But like our\ncommander, we too must accept this\nreality and move on with our lives.
0-756	Hey, you seen Yuzet anywhere?
0-757	He's gotta be in maintenance, I'd say,\nwhat with all the snuffing ruckus the\nNopon are making every single day.
0-760	The commander certainly knows\nhis way around machines, but not\nso much around people.
0-761	True, true. But he sure does\na good job of making us all try\nto keep him out of trouble!
0-762	It's so refreshing to not have that Consul\nrunning his gob all the time!
0-763	He may not be here to manage things\nany more, but we'll cope just fine with\nYuzet around.
0-764	Hmm. Well, with the commander being like\nhe is, Colony 30's gonna follow his whims.\nAlways has, always will do.
0-765	I've been hearing the off-seer's flute\nround the living quarters lately.
0-766	Radek's off-seer successor shouldn't\nhave been assigned yet though. What's\ngoing on, I wonder?
0-767	That Nopon's flute playing is\near-bleedingly bad.
0-768	Tell me about it! That was an off-seer's\nflute being played, wasn't it? Why's a\nNopon got something like that?
0-769	Hey, is it actually possible for\na Nopon to become an off-seer?
0-770	Who knows? I've never heard\nof it happening before.
0-771	How are we going to fill\nthat off-seer vacancy?
0-772	We're not, are we? Not now when the\nFlame Clock's gone and we can't contact\nthe Castle...
0-776	Erun and her team haven't contacted us\never since they started their expedition\ninto Dannagh Desert.
0-777	Maybe they think we're still at war...
0-778	We've gotta get the memo to the guys\nstill out there on expedition.
0-779	Tell 'em that the Flame Clock's been\ndestroyed and that they don't need to\nfight any more!
0-780	They'll be in for a shock. I still can't quite\nbelieve it myself.
0-781	I heard that recently, even Ven's\nbeen collecting Fourtune Clovers.
0-782	You don't say? It's not every day\nyou hear of a mechanic who's into\ncollecting plants now, is it?
0-783	I heard they grew on Laprel Knoll, but I\nhaven't been able to find any sparking\nFourtune Clovers there myself...
0-784	Is that because you're no good at looking\nfor things? It's either that, or everyone else\ngot to them first, I reckon.
0-785	Hey, get this. There's this plant that'll\nbestow good luck upon you if you collect\nseven of them.
0-786	You mean those Fourtune Clovers?\nPeople in my team have been collecting\nthose. It's becoming something of a trend.
0-787	You mechanics have a good gig.\nMust be nice not having to risk your\nhides out there on the front lines.
0-788	And just who do you think are the ones\nmaking sure your snuffing Levnises don't\nconk out on the front lines?
0-789	Why, only our most magnanimous,\nbenevolent mechanics, of course!
0-790	I finished my off-seeing in\nEagus Wilderness.
0-791	Thanks for that. I'm sure the\nguy's passed on to the other side\nwith no regrets now.
0-792	What are we going to do about\nseeing off our fallen comrades\nin Dannagh Desert?
0-793	It's not worth it. We're all distracted\nenough as it is, and besides, it's too\nmuch of a risk.
0-794	Collectopaedia Card use in Colony 4\nisn't all that high despite the place\nbeing how it is.
0-795	It's been like that since before now.\nThat's what makes them so formidable\nand hard to analyze.
0-796	Colony 9's really fallen by the wayside.\nBoth their rank and their army numbers\nare down.
0-797	Let's continue to watch their Collectopaedia\nCards closely. There might come a time\nwhen we have to lend them a hand.
0-798	Have you been looking at Colony 30's\nCollectopaedia Cards?
0-799	Yes. I've observed no changes thus far.
0-800	Did you see the Blade that Ouroboros was\nwielding? He was using these adorable little\nwhite things.
0-801	Yup. And they aren't just a weapon!\nThey could carry your stuff, or make\nfor a convenient back scratcher...
0-802	Do you know of any other people\nwho can wield a blade like Taion's?\nIt's something I'm keen to research.
0-803	I'll have a look. I'll bet talent like\nthat would be highly valuable in\nintel gathering...
0-804	We won't be receiving provisions from\nhome any more, so watch how you get\nthrough the rations.
0-805	I understand. I'm keeping a daily tally of\nhow much we consume and procure.
0-806	Hey, is it me, or has our grub\nbeen getting worse lately?
0-807	Probably just you. It still tastes\nthe same as it always has to me...
0-808	That was a good Harvest Day, wasn't it?
0-809	Yeah, it really made feel like I'd become\na proper member of Colony Iota.
0-810	We're really going to carry on\nwith Harvest Day despite lacking\na Flame Clock, huh?
0-811	You know Dame Alex. She sees the\nsituation as all the more reason for us\nto make this Harvest Day the best yet.
0-812	I'm sorry. I'm sure people see us\nin a worse light now...
0-813	Forget that. There's a reason us mechanics\nneed to do our jobs properly, and that's\nbecause our comrades' lives depend on it.
0-814	We've pretty much sent out all the supplies\nwe could. Seems like every colony is going\nto need to become self-sufficient now.
0-815	I think we've won them enough time\nthat they'll be able to achieve that.\nA job well done, I'd say.
0-816	Sounds like the other colonies're\nreally appreciating the provisions\nwe sent to them.
0-817	I know we didn't do it for the kudos,\nbut still, I take some small pride\nin knowing they're doing well.
0-818	I guess Dame Alex's birthday was\nactually on a different day.
0-819	And to think that she's still\nonly in her sixth term...
0-820	Hey, isn't it your birthday soon?\nI'll give you a Fourtune Clover\nas a present!
0-821	I know we're not getting supplies from HQ,\nbut that doesn't mean I have to get excited\nabout some leaves, does it...?
0-822	Dame Alex's not only got the foresight\nto know what we need, she's also got\nthe skill to achieve it too.
0-823	If only she could have a little faith in us, eh?\nI have real trouble following her line of logic\nsometimes...
0-824	It feels like Dame Alex has been\nnicer to us lately, doesn't it?
0-825	Perhaps it's thanks to the Ouroboros\nthat she's been easier to talk to.
0-826	The lieutenant's utterly hopeless in a fight.
0-827	Chickadee's sharp, but you've got\na point. It takes more than just brains\nto fill a lieutenant's boots...
0-828	I'm going to do everything I can to make\nabsolutely sure I get chosen on the next\nHarvest Day!
0-829	It's a good system Chickadee's built.
0-830	Dame Alex said that we can build\nan invincible colony if we shuffle the\nchain of command every four terms.
0-831	That's why she made Chickadee lieutenant?\nWhen Dame Alex reaches her tenth term,\nChickadee will be what Dame Alex is now.
0-832	Chelle was going on about supplies outside\nthe colony. You know anything about that?
0-833	Hmm. Maybe our supplies in the colony\naren't the only supplies Iota's got?
0-834	Sounds like there's a snuffload of supplies\nbeing stocked up outside the colony.
0-835	Maybe Dame Alex foresaw this situation?\nIf she did, she's pretty hot stuff, I'd say!
0-836	I haven't seen Chelle around recently.
0-837	She must be busy managing our supplies.\nThe number of colonies we've got relations\nwith just keeps on increasing, after all.
0-838	Please, man. Just...come with me when I go\napologize to Captain Rhyza. Pleeeaseee?
0-839	I know the way he silently stares at you\ncan be scary, but he's a nice guy at the\nend of the day. You'll be fine on your own.
0-840	One thing that hasn't changed is that\nRhyza's unit is still the cornerstone of\nColony Iota's defense.
0-841	Get yourselves psyched up\nfor training, everyone.
0-842	At least we can still use our Collectopaedia\nCards even without the Flame Clock.
0-843	Looks like Sequoia's team will stay\njust as busy as ever, then.
0-844	After jumping on the Collectopaedia\nbandwagon, I posted that I wanted 100\nNopon Coins.
0-845	But after I did that, Sequoia called me\nover and gave me a right scolding...
0-846	Lately, Captain Fili's been watching the\ncolony from atop that hill. He was up there\nfor like, three hours last time.
0-847	What do you think he's doing up there?\nBunking off work maybe?
0-848	Captain Fili's left the colony. I really do\nadmire his determination to see the world.
0-849	Now that there's no Flame Clock,\nhe and the rest of us are free to do\nwhatever we want to.
0-850	Seems like Captain Fili is doing\nwell for himself in Colony 4.
0-851	I think I'd like to try going outside the\ncolony once I reach my tenth term.
0-852	Seems like Captain Fili is doing\nwell for himself in Colony 30.
0-853	I think I'd like to try going outside the\ncolony once I reach my tenth term.
0-854	You got the relief supplies arranged\njust a moment ago, didn't you? You'll\nhave to stop that for now.
0-855	We're going to start lending a hand\nto our former enemy colonies now.
0-856	The colony's plenty stocked up on ether,\nbut don't forget to fill up if you find some\nwhile on mission.
0-857	Understood. I'll be sure to fill up if I find\nan ether channel lying around.
0-858	Till now, we only had to take Keves\ninto account when we made our\ncountermeasures.
0-859	...Yeah, but now, we're just like\nOuroboros, up against Keves and\nAgnus! That's gonna be tough.
0-860	Don't you think the Distant Fingertip\nwould make for a good lookout spot?
0-861	It sure would, but it'd be difficult to\nmove between there and the colony,\ndon't you think?
0-862	Aren't we going to come up with\na plan to get rid of those Ignas\nlurking inside Nid Cave?
0-863	I'd be all for it, if it ends up saving time in\nthe long run... That way, we wouldn't have to\npass through Visura Parkland each time.
0-864	If there's any time to be fighting Colony 4,\nit's gotta be now, right? They're absolutely\nstarving for resources.
0-865	You got that right. There won't be\na better chance than this one.
0-866	How's Colony Mu holding up?
0-867	They're still struggling against\nColony 20, but they'll probably\ncome out on top somehow.
0-868	Colony Rho isn't in a good position.
0-869	Let's send them over some relief supplies\nthen, along with three Ululas and five\nsmall Levnises for good measure.
0-870	The Consul used to put a lot of\nfaith in Dame Alex, so I thought\nhe had some decency.
0-871	But who we trusted, and still trust, is Dame\nAlex, not some dodgy Consul. Don't beat\nyourself up about it.
0-872	Now our Flame Clock is history, we can't\nrequest relief supplies from home, right?
0-873	Sounds like the plan now is to intercept\nand steal other colonies' supply drops.
0-874	The next Harvest Day's almost\nupon us. I hope I get chosen!
0-875	I'm sure you will. There's no one who\nworks half as hard as you do.
0-876	Isn't it fascinating how people in the\nliberated colonies use their Collectopaedia\nCards?
0-877	It really is! They use their cards in a really\ndifferent way, compared to how we use\nours just for equipment and resources.
0-878	We're going to have to redo our analysis.\nCollectopaedia Cards have so many uses,\nit's dizzying.
0-879	This is going to put Sequoia in a foul\nmood again, I'm sure. Still though, I'm\nkinda excited to see what the system can do.
0-880	I guess Collectopaedia Cards can be used\nto make people's lives happier, now, huh?
0-881	Must be why they're calling it the\nCollectopaedia revolution.
0-882	Is the research going smoothly?
0-883	Nope. We'll have to rethink our approach.\nA wrecked Flame Clock wasn't something\nwe ever thought to factor in as a risk.
0-884	We'll have to keep on top of our research\nif we're going to beat Salazar.
0-885	We can't let that weirdo beat us...\nWe'll have to invent something even better\nthan Dame Alex's Collectopaedia Cards.
0-886	I'd almost thought Colony 30\nhad betrayed us back there.
0-887	Me too. But all them guys over there\nwere really thankful for what we did.\nProper made me tear up, it did.
0-888	I've only just come to realize, but everyone\neverywhere truly appreciates what our colony\nhas been doing here.
0-889	We might just be getting closer to the\nideal world Dame Alex envisioned.
0-890	We've got to do our best now, if we want\nthe other colonies keep up their appreciation.
0-891	That'll be our new goal to strive for.
0-892	Could you have ever believed a big ol'\nthing like that was under the sea this\nwhole time?
0-893	I'd love to go and investigate it, but of\ncourse, given the circumstances, we'll\nhave to prioritize taking it down first.
0-894	Can't we get the Ferronis moving?\nWe gotta defeat that stupid Origin.
0-895	We can, but all the ether cylinders in the\ncolony would only power it for an hour, tops.
0-896	Even the colonies still under Moebius\ncontrol are coming under fire.
0-897	Yeah... And it's not like we can\ndo anything to help, either...\nWhat a bitter pill, eh?
0-898	Can't be easy for Gambert, living in\nKeves territory all on his ownsome.
0-899	True, but I bet we could learn from them,\ntoo... Let's discuss it with Dame Alex. Going\nabroad would help us grow and develop.
0-900	Sounds like Gambert's putting in\na real shift over at Colony 30.
0-901	He's the one who helped get that berserk\nLevnis under control, right? ...You don't\nthink he likes 'em better than us, do you?
0-902	We got some sweet tech from the\ntech summit with Colony 30, eh?
0-903	Yup, now that we can study Kevesi\ntech, Iota's going to become even\nmore powerful.
0-904	Captain Chelle was doing a delivery\ntoday, if I'm not mistaken?
0-905	Oh yeah! They should've\nalready arrived by now.
0-906	Have you *seen* the state of the food\nand medical supplies in Colony 4?
0-907	You can add equipment and ether\ncylinders to that list too. They're running\nout of resources all across the board.
0-908	About those supplies we're\nsending to Colony Tau...
0-909	They can wait! We've had a change\nof plans. Our next delivery's now\ngoing to Colony 4.
0-910	There's been loads of deliveries lately.\nWe'll need to resupply, and soon.
0-911	We're at 20% of our remaining stock...
0-912	How are we getting through\nresources so quickly?!
0-913	We need to hurry up with the\nresupply. Our allied troops are\nin a tough spot right now!
0-914	We got a summons from Dame Alex,\ndidn't we? Only problem is that I can't\nremember where it's supposed to be!
0-915	Seriously? It was the base entrance!\nGet yourself together, man...
0-916	It sure is going to be rough having to get\nby without the Castle sending us anything...
0-917	What are you exaggerating for?\nWe've got a whole stockpile of food\nand medical supplies, you know?
0-918	How far have we progressed on\nthe supply shortages handling?
0-919	It's almost complete!\nCaptain Chelle appears to be\nin charge of distribution.
0-920	I wanna do something productive,\nyou know? Something that'll boost\nmorale around here...
0-921	Funnily enough, I've had an idea.\nI thought maybe we should give the value\nof our G its own little boost...
0-922	Now that I have all this free time to kill,\nI'm gonna go get some cosmetics, and\nreally make myself look like a million G!
0-923	Quite a few of us seem\nto be into that stuff.
0-924	Well, of course! You wanna live life like\nyou're a million G, then you gotta look\nthe part! That's what I think!
0-925	We'll have to come up with a plan to\nensure our ongoing survival if we're\ngoing to become more self-sufficient.
0-926	I mean, to get down to brass tacks,\nit's basically a question of where\nwe allocate our manpower, right?
0-927	Let's focus our efforts on developing the\ncolony! The more powerful we are, the\nbetter our chances of survival will become!
0-928	Then manufacturing Levnis parts is the\npriority, right? Think how we could change\nup our tactics if we can make that work!
0-929	So, here we are - ultimately caught up in a\nscramble for existing fuel reserves...
0-930	It's imperative that we develop new energy\nsources, and the only way to do it is by\nincreasing the number of research staff.
0-931	Salazar was in a proper\ngood mood earlier...
0-932	Must've found her next prey. Something's\n'bout to go down, mark my words.
0-933	What do you think Salazar's trying to achieve\nwith this Ouroboros experiment of hers?
0-934	I'm trying not to think about it,\nthank you! I'd rather not get sent\noff to medical, unlike you, apparently!
0-935	Oh, I'm so gonna get back at that Salazar\nfor making me drink that...whatever the\nsnuff that was!
0-936	So the mad scientist's next test subject is the\nOuroboros... That's just asking for trouble...
0-937	What would Dame Alex like as\na present? Something tasteful\nshould do the trick, surely?
0-938	It's really hard thinking of anything\nsuitably cool and unique!
0-939	What term is Dame Alex\nreaching this year?
0-940	Your guess is as good as mine. And it's not\nlike she'd tell anyone, even if she was nearing\nHomecoming age, right...?
0-941	Not much longer till Dame Alex's birthday\nnow... Oh, how I worry about her...
0-942	She's not reaching her tenth term, you\nworrywart! She'll still stick around this\nyear, I can tell you that much!
0-943	My Queen, does something\nsmell good around here!
0-944	You do know it's Dame Alex's birthday\nsoon, right? I thought I'd cook up\nsomething scrumptious for her!
0-945	This year's birthday really does seem to\nmean something special for everyone, huh.
0-946	It's because we can now all celebrate\ntogether without having to worry about\nhow much juice the Flame Clock's got.
0-947	Have you seen this Collectopaedia Card?
0-948	I have, I have! Whoever thought to use it\nto send messages around is a genius.
0-949	So like, I've been seeing different requests\ncoming in from the same requester...
0-950	Wait, are the messages all in a sequence...?\nWhoa, so that's how you're meant to read it!
0-951	You won't wanna mess with Captain\nSequoia right now. She's still in a bad\nmood about *that* whole thing.
0-952	Got ya... She can't exactly do her job\nproperly without accurate info...
0-953	We're overhauling our logistics again...\nIs this really sparking necessary?
0-954	We'll just have to go over and\nfind out why, I guess.
0-955	...And just like that, I'd found myself a\nbrand new friend. No fuss, no hassle!
0-956	It's mind-boggling how useful\nCollectopaedia Cards are. They could\nseriously change everyone's lives!
0-957	You know what's odd? The Flame Clock\nisn't here any more, but I still have my mark...
0-958	There's a lot of us in our tenth term now,\nCommander Isurd included. There isn't a lot\nof time left to consider what has to be done.
0-961	A part of the Urayan Mountains\njust up and vanished.
0-962	I would've liked to dispatch a survey team\nif we'd had the manpower, but right now,\nour focus is on restoring Lambda.
0-963	Shouldn't we really get on with investigating\nwhat to do should Keves decide to use\ntheir new weapon against Lambda...?
0-964	Relax, Taion's lot managed to destroy it.\nWe won't need to worry about Lambda going\nthe way of the Urayan Mountains.
0-965	The Auto-Levs are key to Lambda's\ndefense. Make sure they're ready to\ndeploy at a moment's notice.
0-966	I know, I know... Sparks, chill out a bit...
0-967	It's nice to know that we're able to mine\nso much ether out of the Urayan Tunnels.
0-968	Gotta appreciate our trusty Armadillos.\nWe'd be nothing without Auto-Levs.
0-969	We're rarely the ones starting\nthe battle these days, that's true...
0-970	But it's no excuse for any of you to skip\nout on training. Not when we've got our\ncolony and our allies to protect.
0-971	...But what if the enemy pushed us\nback to here in a column formation?
0-972	That'd just result in a deadlock. However,\nif we hid our soldiers in Lambda's Ferronis,\nwe'd be able to cause some chaos at least...
0-973	People've been saying that Colony 5\nreached Gold rank, but then they were\nwiped out of existence by Moebius.
0-974	All this time we thought we were fighting to\nbetter our lot, when all we were doing was\ndancing in the palm of their hand...
0-975	And I thought the reason there weren't any\nGold colonies in Keves or Agnus was due\nto that rank being near impossible to reach.
0-976	If only they'd known what was coming...
0-977	A Nopon told me that a good present\nfor a pilot would be some Miraculite\nfrom the Fornis region.
0-978	You should be able to get some through your\nCollectopaedia Card. Somebody in Iota or 4\nis bound to do you a solid, if you just ask.
0-979	I've been wanting to get my hands on one\nlast Fourtune Clover, but I'm not sure if I can\nget one using my Collectopaedia Card...
0-980	Just go for it, I'd say. Either way, you'll\nneed to have luck and fate on your side.
0-981	I still feel like my head's half in a dream.
0-982	Tell me about it... Can't tell if it's because we\nall lost consciousness, or because this new\nreality is a whole lot to process at once...
0-983	Ngh... Where am I...?
0-984	So you've finally come to? All I'll say is\nthat there's a lot happening right now that\nyou aren't even going to begin to believe.
0-985	With Commander Isurd leading us,\nColony Lambda held firm against\nwhoever dared to stand against her.
0-986	But with the situation as it is now, how\nis he going to lead us through it?
0-987	I suppose we don't need to fight\nagainst Colony 4 or 30 any more...
0-988	Even so, we still have Colony 5 and 11 in\nour vicinity, and then there's the Castle.\nWhat will Commander Isurd do next?
0-989	Limiting as an immobile Ferronis may be,\nat least we have this cave here to make\nour base.
0-990	Yep. Having so few supplies to haul makes\na cave a decent place to make base. Way\neasier to fortify and defend too.
0-991	Why do you think that off-seer\nsent off them mudpuppets?
0-992	Beats me. They sure gave off a pretty light\ndespite not being proper husks, though...
0-993	Yo, did you see those mudpuppets giving off\nlight when they got sent off? Didn't get a\ngood feeling from that, I gotta say.
0-994	Is that right? Still, it's no skin off my nose,\nto be honest. I never pay attention to those\nkind of things, anyway.
0-995	That Selin from Colony Tau was proper\nshocked by how many people we've got\nhere at Lambda.
0-996	Why, what's it like where he's from?\n...In fact, where on Aionios is Tau anyway...?
0-997	Has Selin already gone back\nto Colony Tau?
0-998	Looks like it. He was pretty eager about\ntesting the probes. Hope I get to see him\nagain sometime.
0-999	Did we just all lose consciousness\nfor a good long while?
0-1000	Couldn't tell ya. I think I saw a different\nConsul to the usual one had come along,\nbut after that, I can't remember a thing...
0-1001	The Consul caused us all sorts of\nupheaval, but that won't stop Koji\ngoing forward with his plan, eh?
0-1002	Certainly not, it seems. He's been\nsaying that we must begin thinking\nabout Lambda's future.
0-1003	We're going to need those\nAuto-Levs if we're going to make\nthe Urayan Tunnels plan work.
0-1004	They've got ongoing issues, but\nit's still all being worked on.
0-1005	You're headed for the Great Sword, right?
0-1006	I am indeed. My next leg'll take me over\nMuroon Bridge and up the Great Cotte Falls.\nIt's...gonna be a long, long trip.
0-1007	There're some mysterious ruins\nat the Great Cotte Falls. Could you\nplease send a team to survey them?
0-1008	I can't authorize that survey right now. Our\ntop priority is to stabilize this colony, now\nthat supplies from home have dried up.
0-1009	It's really uncanny seeing Kevesi Levnises\nstationed here in our colony.
0-1010	And it's not just Levnises, but their tech\nand people too. I suppose this is going to\nbecome our new "normal"...
0-1011	These Kevesi Levnises are built for long\nrange fighting, which counters our\nLevnises... No surprises there.
0-1012	And their machines're easier to maintain too.\nYou can get parts for them from just about\nanywhere.
0-1013	So, I put in a request to change colony.\nTold them I want to be somewhere further\nback to offer my services as a mechanic.
0-1014	Shame to see you go. But let me tell you,\nthe change in environment's gonna hit you\npretty hard. I'd reconsider, personally.
0-1015	When Commander Isurd was on expedition\nto Rae-Bel Tableland, there was one tree\nthat he just gazed at, all absentmindedly.
0-1016	I think I pretty much know why.\nHe'd get pretty mad if I told you, though.
0-1017	I've gotta go prepare some onigiri\nto take to Commander Isurd.
0-1018	He eats like ten of those\nthings a day, doesn't he?
0-1019	Seems like the case of that mysterious\nLevnis that attacked the transport has\nbeen sorted.
0-1020	That's put my mind at ease for now,\nthough we'll need to stay on our toes.\nWe've still got plenty of enemies out there.
0-1021	We can get some peace of mind\nknowing that Origin can't go after\nus here directly, eh?
0-1022	I wouldn't be too relaxed if I were you.\nIf this place caves in, then we're not\ngetting out any time soon.
0-1023	It's crazy to think that both our Ferronis\nand our Flame Clock were destroyed\nwhile we were blissfully unaware...
0-1024	Yeah, after watching that off-seeing...\nI really feel like we've gotta start moving\nforward somehow.
0-1025	I found a mother lode of Dainty Shrooms\nin a cave down south of Colony Lambda!
0-1026	We'll have to contact the supply corps\nand get them to pick those up then.
0-1027	The commander's been away from\nthe colony a lot more, hasn't he?\nAccompanying Taion and what not.
0-1028	It's no biggie. We've got a super-solid system\nin place for cases exactly like that.
0-1029	You ever got the chance to see\nCommander Isurd out there in battle?\nThe guy can both attack and heal.
0-1030	It was seeing him as a commander that\ninspired me to be an officer, actually. Still,\nhe's one of the best soldiers we ever had.
0-1031	Have they figured out what caused the\nAuto-Levs to go berserk yet?
0-1032	Not so easy-peasy. Teensy-weensy bit\nmore time needed to solve mystery.
0-1033	Commander Isurd seems\na little less fatigued now.
0-1034	We'll need him to be at his best,\nand soon. Colony Lambda's still\ngot issues that need resolving.
0-1035	The commander has been\npretty joyful as of late.
0-1036	He keeps banging on about taking all the\ncolony to a "spa" once everything's sorted.\nI'm afraid I don't even know what a spa is.
0-1037	The commander's been requesting the\nAuto-Levs for mining work more and more.
0-1038	I'm assuming it's because he wants to\ndig deeper until he finds a source of\nhot water for his "spa".
0-1039	So glad canteen now up and running.
0-1040	It ain't as good as what we've had in\nthe Ferronis, but at least we've got\na place to eat in peace.
0-1041	Took a spark-load of time\njust to set up the canteen.
0-1042	But it was all worth the effort, 'cause now\nwe can treat ourselves to a proper grillwrap!
0-1043	There's others here besides Shijima\nwho're at the end of their tenth term and\nready to receive a Homecoming...
0-1044	Makes me wonder if there's anything\nwe could do for 'em...
0-1045	It's nice not having to bust our butts to fuel\nthe Flame Clock, but we lost Homecoming\nalong with it, and the colony ranks too...
0-1046	Right, we've got nothing to aim towards now.\nI guess all we have now is dealing with\nwhatever's in front of us...
0-1047	Kitty's Auto-Lev reboot experiment\nseems to have been a success.
0-1048	Am I glad to hear that! Now we can\nafford to halve the number of people\nwe've got on watch duty...
0-1049	Will Armadillo no longer come\nfor big bash-and-smash?
0-1050	The enemy identification system has been\nrecalibrated now. You can relax.
0-1051	The supplies we'd stockpiled against\nColony 5 have all been recovered\nwithout too much hassle.
0-1052	We got lucky. Or should I say we have\nthe supply corps and survey branch to\nthank for that... Oh, and the Ouroboros too.
0-1053	Took a good long while to retrieve those\nsupplies from the Urayan Trail...
0-1054	That'll be due to all the different\nsquads discussing what the best\ncourse of action was, I'd wager.
0-1055	Koji's idea's got a good ring to it.
0-1056	But you've gotta admit, he is being a little\ncoercive about it - like he's trying to bend\nand get past all the rules we have here.
0-1057	Who'd have thought of entrusting surplus\nether cylinders to the Nopon Caravan\nto sell on?
0-1058	None of the captains look all too\nenthusiastic about it though. Still, we've\ngotta recognize Koji's hard work.
0-1059	Varen apparently developed a sensor that\nflags when an enemy is approaching.
0-1060	And he only just got done developing\nthe ether probe with Koji, didn't he?\nMy man's on a roll.
0-1061	I've been feeling recently that it's become\na little difficult to do anything in Lambda.
0-1062	Friend only notice now? Colony feel mired\nin sea of boring rules and regs. It drive\naway all and any budding traderpon.
0-1063	Koji's gone about things the wrong way. It's\ntaken up loads of resources, and we ended up\nneeding to patch up a bunch of wounded...
0-1064	I know... Still, I get why he did it.
0-1065	We took a whole lot of damage in that\nlast battle, soldiers and Levnises both.
0-1066	I'm well aware of that. I suppose Koji\nthought this was the only way to\nmake everyone aware of the problem.
0-1067	The Ouroboros were a massive\nhelp in the last battle.
0-1068	They certainly were. There was practically\nno way we were going to defend ourselves\non our own.
0-1069	The good news is that now we don't\nneed to wait for each captain to sign\noff on things any more.
0-1070	Really? That's going to hugely speed up\nour response time to issues. Lambda\njust keeps getting on better and better!
0-1071	So now the Commander is hoping we\nwould act more like Koji, is he?
0-1072	Yeah. He wants us to be able to think for\nourselves, not just follow rules and orders...
0-1073	Colony Lambda feel very nice lately.\nCan ignore silly strict rules and no one\nact all grumpy-grump about it.
0-1074	Uhh... With guys like you around, it's just \na matter of time before those silly strict rules\ncome right back with a vengeance...
0-1075	So, about that supply route we\ndiscussed earlier...?
0-1076	Let's try it out. I'm sure it'll be\nof good use to Colony Lambda.
0-1077	I can really see and feel how\nColony Lambda's changing.
0-1078	Me too. If we all work together\ntowards the same goal, we'll be\nall the stronger for it.
0-1079	I don't believe it! Both our Flame Clock\nand our Ferronis are in ruins!
0-1080	I feel like I haven't woken up yet.\nIt's hard to accept our world's been\nturned upside down like this...
0-1081	What are we going to do about the campaign\nagainst Colony 5 we were preparing?\nIt's practically at the finish line, you know?
0-1082	We'll have to suspend it. You should\nunderstand how the massive changes in\ncircumstances have affected priorities, no?
0-1083	Ugh... It's so inconvenient\nnot having a proper canteen.
0-1084	Just how snuffing long are we going\nto have to go without one?
0-1085	Never thought the canteen would\nend up out of commission...
0-1086	Guess we'll have to hope manufacturing\ncan patch it up for us quickly...
0-1087	The squad in charge of logistics\nseem to be working real hard.
0-1088	They're the sort who'll work hard if\nthey've got a tasty meal in their bellies.
0-1089	Give me three meals a day,\nand I'm good, but still...
0-1090	Yeah. It would be nice if we actually\nhad somewhere to eat them...
0-1091	Are both of our off-seers\naway at the same time?
0-1092	Looks like it. Just where\ncould they have gone?
0-1093	Oh yeah, I saw Shijima going\ninto the tunnels earlier.
0-1094	The tunnels? What's he gone\nand wandered in there for?
0-1095	I suppose he might have some business\nout the other end of them?
0-1096	Has a search party been sent\nout to look for Shijima?
0-1097	Well, I can say my squad hasn't heard\nanything about it, that's for sure.
0-1098	Shijima still isn't home.\nWhat are we going to do?
0-1099	Just sit tight, and see what happens, I guess?\nCan't very well all go after him, can we?
0-1100	Do we still not know the cause\nbehind the Auto-Levs going nuts?
0-1101	They said everyone at engineering\nis looking into it...
0-1102	Yeah...? Well, I wonder\nwhat they'll find out...
0-1103	We're not going to be able to defend\nourselves all that well without Auto-Levs.
0-1104	Well, we'll just have to make do. It's\nnot like we've forgotten how to defend\nourselves. We'll be fine, trust me.
0-1105	I hope they find a way to fix 'em somehow...\nYou heard any good news on that front?
0-1106	All I can tell ya is that it's a job best left to\nLevnis specialists, and I'm not one of them.
0-1107	Has there ever been a time an Auto-Lev's\nbroken down before now?
0-1108	Not that I can recall...
0-1109	There's a whole lot about these Auto-Levs\nthat can't be understood, huh?
0-1110	Right, not even engineering fully understand\nthe things. Sounds like a right tricky job...
0-1111	We've been mining tons\nof ether out, it seems.
0-1112	Yeah. With all that energy at our disposal,\nwe've got nothing to worry about.
0-1113	If anything, it feels like we have more\nof it than we know what to do with, but\nhey, it's better than the alternative.
0-1114	So, Koji came up with some\nscheme to mine out more ether.
0-1115	Just where would we be without Koji?\nHe's also the one who's been putting\npressure on Commander Isurd, right?
0-1116	The guy's not short of enthusiasm,\nI'll give him that.
0-1117	If you mean Koji, then yeah.\nLambda can't do without him.
0-1118	As long as we have him around,\nLambda's in good shape.
0-1119	The requests for ether just\nkeep on coming in.
0-1120	We may have plenty of the stuff lying\naround, but we'll still need to think\ncarefully about how we use it.
0-1121	We're truly lucky here, aren't we?\nLife's looking pretty rosy these days.
0-1122	Yeah, though we'll really be sitting\npretty if we can actually keep ahold\nof our ether reserves...
0-1123	Seems like Varen's hard at work\non something again.
0-1124	He's supposedly starting development on\nanother new thing. Snuffed if I know what\nit's all about, though.
0-1125	Hey, by the by, do you know anything\nabout what Varen's working on?
0-1126	I don't... But I hope it's something to stand in\nfor the Auto-Levs, though.
0-1127	For sure. Our defenses could\ndefinitely use some shoring up...
0-1128	I've noticed a lot of worrying things\nabout our defensive capacity lately.
0-1129	Well, Varen's been busy lately, working on\nsomething, so it might be that very problem\nis about to get solved. You never know!
0-1130	People've been saying that Varen's\ndeveloping something that'll strengthen\nour defenses.
0-1131	Really? That'd be a great help, let me tell\nyou. This place could really do with some\nupdated defense systems.
0-1132	I'm worried for that Moraine.\nShijima was exceptional at what\nhe did, and now he's gone.
0-1133	True... But what can we do for her?\nWe're not off-seers ourselves, are we?
0-1134	I never did hang out too much\nwith the guy, but even so, I always\nthought of him as a friend.
0-1135	I think most of us feel that way...\nFine man, he was.
0-1136	Well, if it's true he died with a content\nlook on his face, that's one positive we\ncan take from all this.
0-1137	The same thing'll happen to us\nsooner or later, won't it? It just...\ndoesn't bear thinking about.
0-1138	No use despairing about it. Shijima knew\nhimself and faced it head on. Moraine's the\nsame. Off-seers are made of stronger stuff.
0-1139	That was the first battle we've had in ages,\nbut we're still pretty formidable, eh?!
0-1140	More or less... But there're some\nthings we need to work on.
0-1141	Are there, though?\nYou're overthinking it, mate.
0-1142	Scuttlebutt has it, Koji got put in solitary...
0-1143	I didn't see that coming. I never thought\nill of the guy. In fact, I thought he was a\npretty decent person, myself...
0-1144	Just goes to show, you can never tell...
0-1145	It is Commander Isurd's job after all, isn't\nit? To get us all in line and lead us.
0-1146	Yeah... But we still need to actually\nget his orders if we're going to get\nthings done quickly.
0-1147	I support what Koji did.
0-1148	Yeah... I've been hearing all kinds of talk\nabout that. Seems like times are changing\nhere in our colony as well.
0-1149	If you have the colony's interests at heart,\nthen surely you have to understand that\nKoji's got the right idea here.
0-1150	All I do is fight, so it's probably good for\nme to be subject to a few rules and\nregulations.
0-1151	Well, sure, but me and the guys at logistics\nare getting fed up with how bloated the\npeacetime bureaucracy is.
0-1152	We're working with other colonies, and we\ngot more on our plate, but we still got all\nthis red tape... Throughput's important!
0-1153	The Guard'll have the Castle\nsecure and safe, believe me.
0-1154	But what if they just start arguing with\nthose snuffers from the Gardin Defense\nBase instead?
0-1155	Fort O'Virbus is up ahead. Though it's not\nlike we're getting in, what with the gates\nbeing closed.
0-1156	They've got another thing coming if they\nthink they're going to keep us quiet for\nlong, gahahaha!
0-1157	It takes a certain kind of crazy to build\nsomething like the Annihilator, eh?
0-1158	It wipes enemies off the map and doesn't\neven let you steal from their Flame Clocks.\nIt's messed up, is what it is.
0-1159	When the Annihilator powered up,\nit just seemed to suck in all the\nsurrounding black fog...
0-1160	Does that absurd power it's got have to\ndo with that annihilation effect stuff?
0-1161	Oh, come ooonnnnn. Don't tell me\ncomms are down *again*.
0-1162	This whole area's overflowing with black\nfog. It'll almost always be quicker to have\nsomeone run messages on foot.
0-1163	The Queen was some mechanical puppet...\nHave we all been taken for fools? Was all\nthat sacrifice and struggle for nothing?
0-1164	...So some idiots might say, but it's got\nnothing to do with us lot! Couldn't give\na flyin' spark, gahahaha!!!
0-1165	The Queen was just some robot?\nThen does that mean she was as\nstrong as a Levnis?
0-1166	That's so sick! I'd have loved to\nhave had a battle to the death with her\nif that was the case.
0-1167	Meat... I need that rich, juicy meat...
0-1168	The Mild Game Stew at our canteen is\nthe Flamii's knees, isn't it?
0-1169	Remember when we stopped by Colony Tau\non the last hunt? What do you think it was,\nthose meals they gave us to eat?
0-1170	You won't believe it, but they were leaves!\nCan't believe anyone could fill their bellies\njust with that... Still though, tasty enough.
0-1171	It's looking like the Ferronis isn't\ngoing to budge any time soon.
0-1172	Shame, eh? It could actually do some damage\nto Origin, not like us pipsqueaks...
0-1173	Imagine if our Ferronis\nspecialized in offense...
0-1174	Well, it was made for protecting the\nCastle, right? That's why it's gotta be\nfirst class at that very job.
0-1175	Forget about the Flame Clock, fighting's\nthe only thing I've ever known - only thing\nthat I've ever lived for...
0-1176	They can't just tell us that we've been\nfreed from fighting and expect us to know\nwhat to do next.
0-1177	I'm from a Silver rank colony too, so that\nalone should count for something...
0-1178	But the commander here's on a whole other\nlevel. She's the best dual Blade wielder in all\nof Aionios.
0-1179	"Ashera is an offensive Defender. She grabs\nthe foe's attention with relentless offense,\nprotecting her allies and crushing said foe..."
0-1180	"It's the kind of role for those unafraid\nto die..." Not your average grunt, in\nother words.
0-1181	Standing guard at the Castle is so dull.\nWe're soldiers for spark's sake, we should\nbe out there going on the offensive.
0-1182	How I wish I could go a round against the\nCommander again... Not to mention those\nOuroboros, heheh.
0-1183	Shall we get going and\nassault the Castle, then?
0-1184	Wow, you're pretty casual about it, huh?\nIt's like you're asking, "what's for lunch?"\n...That's great, you'll fit right in.
0-1185	Haven't heard a peep from the Castle\nGuard for a good long while now.
0-1186	Who cares what those snuffers all the way\nup there think? Don't matter to us, it don't.
0-1187	Keep your distance from Hovering Reef 4,\nis my advice. Nothing good can come from\ngetting too close.
0-1188	Bahahaha! Well, now you've *really*\nmade me wanna go and poke around!
0-1189	If you look out from the Castle and past the\nother side of the fort, you can see Cadensia\nand the mountains there, right?
0-1190	Check this: Agnus is using the pass there to\nmarch on to the Pentelas region. Guess they\ndon't want a fight with us? Hmph... Rude.
0-1191	It's a good thing Easel's unit loves hunting.\nEnsures we never run out of food... Well,\nunless someone hates meat.
0-1192	And we've also got the ether mine nearby\nto plunder if we need fuel. We should be\npretty set for now.
0-1193	There we were, present as ordered, and\nthat snuffing Consul just up and turns tail!
0-1194	And there I was, thinking that she'd give\nAshera a run for her G... Pathetic behavior\ncoming from a Consul. Tch!
0-1195	The Consul's coming back here again,\nain't she? Better make sure we give her\na grand welcome.
0-1196	Yeah, I've had it with waiting... I just want\nto trample all over the mudder already.
0-1197	Ultimately, Ashera and the Ouroboros\nbrought their A-game at just the right\ntime... (sigh)
0-1198	It was a shame, really. I was\nhaving a field day going up against\nthose undead soldiers.
0-1199	That Consul only gave us battles we\nwere capable of winning. Made things\nreally boring.
0-1200	I know what it is I find fun in a fight,\nand it's not racking up easy wins for\nmy win count.
0-1201	If you cross the Syra Hovering Reefs from\nnear the First Ixia Bridge, you'll be able to\ngo around to the Castle's rear gate.
0-1202	...Or at least that's what I heard, but I have\nno guarantee that that's really the case.
0-1203	It's refreshing not having to listen to the\nscoldings that the bigwigs from the Castle\nused to give us.
0-1204	All the soldiers at the Castle are so stiff\nand uptight, not to mention the guards\nand officers. It's mad...
0-1205	Yo, Ouroboros! Had yourself a spark\nof a time at the Castle, I heard.
0-1206	Why didn't you tell us about that?! Make\nsure you invite us along the next time you\ndecide to have a party like that, you hear?!
0-1207	So you snuck inside the Castle, destroyed the\nAnnihilator, *and* made it back out alive?
0-1208	Phwoar, I knew you were something else!\nMakes me really itch to try and kill you,\nnot gonna lie, heh heh heh...
0-1209	Gotta wonder if the guys\nat the fort are holding up.
0-1210	I do hope they are. And I hope even more\nthat they'll try and have a crack against\ngood old Colony 11 sometime soon, haha!
0-1211	With the Castle's Flame Clock\nall smashed up, we should be good\nto enter the fort now, I think.
0-1212	I can't wait till I finally get to visit the\nTap-Dancing Nopon again, and dine\non the finest grub Keves has to offer.
0-1213	Curse those Moebius snuffers for\nhiding that big ol' thing from us.
0-1214	Can you imagine how cool it'd be to ride\nthat thing and raise sparks with it?!
0-1215	It looks like those attacks from Origin have\nbeen vaporizing colonies all over Aionios.
0-1216	I mean, I want to die in battle, but I'd\nrather there be an actual battle, not just\nevaporating into thin air, you know?
0-1217	When's the next battle?
0-1218	It won't just fall into our lap. We've got\nto take the initiative and strike first.
0-1219	There's been skirmishes taking\nplace between Keves and Agnus\non the Urayan Trail.
0-1220	How about we go and see for ourselves?\nIt's not like the commander or anyone is\ngoing to stop us, right?
0-1221	Sounds like the Three Ravens finally\ncapitulated to the Ouroboros.
0-1222	Huh, well, fine. If they're that strong,\nthen they're certainly welcome here.
0-1223	So, we're going to be following\nOuroboros's orders from now on,\nare we?
0-1224	If you don't like it, then go take them\non yourself. Power is everything here,\nyou know that well enough.
0-1225	Was Zoren's unit actually fighting to\nprotect Colony Lambda?
0-1226	I mean, Captain Zor just lives to fight.\nHe doesn't need a reason for it or\nanything like that.
0-1227	That Strider's bunking off\nmissions *again*.
0-1228	And Widow comes and goes as she pleases\ntoo. They must be brave to court Zor's wrath\nlike that.
0-1229	Branden got some good cuts of meat\nin, told us to come over and get some\nMild Stew.
0-1230	I'm guessing that means Easel's unit\ngot back from hunting.
0-1231	That Hexen, man... Only way I can\nput it is that she's got that *look* in\nher eyes, you know?
0-1232	Word is, she was even wilder and crazier\nbefore she came over to Colony 11.
0-1233	Captain Clad really likes to make sure\nwe're all well looked after, doesn't he?
0-1234	Yup. Out of the Three Ravens, he's the\nmost direct. He'll even come along to\nthe training sessions of grunts like us.
0-1235	That snuffing Knoquehardt... He's\n"initiating" yet another poor newbie!
0-1236	And he thinks he's doing it for their\nown good, which just makes it worse...
0-1237	How much longer is this\ntraining going on for...?
0-1238	For as long as Knoquehardt wants it\nto be. Shut up and get on with it, mate.
0-1239	Training, training, training...\nAre we ever gonna take a break?
0-1240	Tch... Shut yer gob. You'll be no use on\nthe battlefield if you can't get through\nsessions like these.
0-1241	I've had it... Just put me on the battlefield,\nplease... I can't take any more training...\nI'm begging yooou...
0-1242	I wanna take out some mudders already...\nHave meeercyyy...
0-1243	Oh, hey. That's another rookie\nKnoque just mentally destroyed.
0-1244	There's no place here for the sane of mind.\nHe might actually be doing them a favor...
0-1245	That Teach fella. He sure knows how\nto handle himself on the battlefield.
0-1246	So there are commanders in Agnus with\nsome backbone? Color me impressed.
0-1247	We can never beat those Ouroboros,\nno matter how hard we try. They're\nsomething else, I tell ya!
0-1248	Well, I mean, yeah mate. They *are*\nsomething different. They transform\nand stuff.
0-1249	It's been ages since I've enjoyed a good\n"We're absolutely gonna snuff up Ashera\nthis time, no question" party.
0-1250	No, it's called the "Let's all have us a\ngrand old time fighting each other to the\ndeath" party. Get it right.
0-1251	Did they seriously take over the Castle?!\nAwwrite, pile in! All aboard, everyone!
0-1252	Zor and the others gained control of the\nplace ages back. How didn't you catch\non earlier?
0-1253	Wasn't Captain Zoren originally meant to be\nCaptain of the Guard? Why did he come to\nColony 11, instead?
0-1254	Dunno. Maybe he got demoted, maybe he\nleft of his own volition? He's the only one\nwho knows.
0-1255	Been a while since I had a fight that\ntough. That Consul's the real deal. I wish\nshe'd just gone full-pelt to begin with.
0-1256	It's all the more a shame we won't\nget a rematch. Ashera better take\nresponsibility for finishing her off!
0-1257	I snuffing hope I don't have to face\nthose undying soldiers ever again.
0-1258	Personally, I like playing the underdog.\nIt's battles I'm guaranteed to lose that\nI can't stand.
0-1259	We took out two Consuls, which means\nthey're gonna be even more on-guard\nagainst us now.
0-1260	You got that right... Ah, gets my heart\nracing just thinking about them near-death\nencounters. Heh heh.
0-1261	I've got no memory of what\nhappened here recently. It's\nlike I just slept through it.
0-1262	You probably have the\nConsul to thank for that.
0-1263	There's no Consuls in the Castle any more.
0-1264	Yeah. It's quiet now, but it kinda feels\nlike something's missing... Dunno, it's just\na weird vibe I get.
0-1265	I thought the Castle would always stand\nstrong no matter how many assaults\nfrom Agnus it took...
0-1266	But all it ultimately took was a small\nsquad of soldiers... Those Ouroboros are\non another level compared to us grunts.
0-1267	The Castle's got its own ether mine,\nit's got black fog all around, not to mention\nthe sheer number of defensive installations...
0-1268	I really thought it could stand firm\nagainst any and all assailants...
0-1269	Colonies whose Flame Clocks were\ndestroyed by Ouroboros are basically\non their own, right?
0-1270	Meaning, we need to get on with thinking\nabout how we can best support them...
0-1271	I'm starting to think I might've been\nbetter off leading a squad than being\na Castle inspector...
0-1272	We may still be in the same jobs, even\nafter all that's happened, sure... But hey,\nwhat you do is still a big help to the colonies!
0-1273	Let's head to the Tap-Dancing Nopon\nonce we're done with training.
0-1274	I've gotta try their Cured-Meat Vizzard!
0-1275	The canteen lady's worked there\nfor ages, apparently.
0-1276	That must mean she's not only\nfed our mentors, but our mentors'\nmentors, too.
0-1277	The Castle and defense bases are\nall in good nick, I assume?
0-1278	Absolutely. We've got to make sure the\nCastle's fit for the true Queen's return.
0-1279	Sounds like Her Majesty the Queen has\nbeen rescued. I'm just dying to meet her!
0-1280	Me too! It's already massively boosted\nthe morale of everyone here.
0-1281	All that time I worked my arse off so the\nQueen could see me at my Homecoming,\nand she turns out to be a fake...
0-1282	You're not the only one feeling that way.\nThe Consuls had us all fooled.
0-1283	I got to meet Her Majesty the Queen in\nthe flesh. She's nothing like that fake.
0-1284	She's got this whole vibe, or aura around\nher... One look was all I needed to know\nthat she was the real deal.
0-1285	With Queen Melia, Agnus, and the\nOuroboros by our side, we'll show\nOrigin who's boss.
0-1286	I'll do my part to make sure we're ready.
0-1287	I was talking with some Agnian soldiers\nearlier, and it was pretty clear that our\nnations are set up completely differently.
0-1288	Like how Agnus doesn't have Castle\ninspectors, while we don't have an\ninternal affairs bureau, for a start.
0-1289	How about one massive attack at Origin\nwith every Centuris and Gastrates the\ncolonies can muster?
0-1290	That won't even put a dent in it. Origin\nbrushed off a Ferronis attack like it was\nnothing, remember?
0-1291	All the time we were prepared to assault\nAgnus once its Castle fell, and for what...?
0-1292	We were better off avoiding a fruitless\nbattle like that, anyway. It's not like we'd\nhave come out of it unscathed.
0-1293	I ain't working with no Lost Numbers.\nPod-snatching mudders, the lot o' them.
0-1294	But, I mean... Looking at their actions,\nand what the Consuls did... Surely you\ncan see who was right?
0-1295	I had a call with an Agnian officer the\nother day. And honestly? They were very\nwelcoming and friendly.
0-1296	That's a surprise. With all the bitterness and\nhate there's been between us, I'd've thought\nthey wouldn't give us the time of day...
0-1297	I'm going to look into how all the colonies,\nenemy or allied, are doing, damage-wise.
0-1298	That big ol' behemoth in the Great Sea\nhas been wreaking havoc with no regard\nfor whom it strikes.
0-1299	There's a door that can't be opened\non the Grand Tower Walkway, isn't\nthere? Where does it lead to?
0-1300	I wouldn't know. Though I've heard\npeople say that only Her Majesty can\nopen that door.
0-1301	I did an off-seeing once, in front of the\nConsul... The last Consul in the Castle.
0-1302	He just quietly watched over me.\nHe didn't have quite the same air\nas the other Consuls...
0-1303	I always wondered about where the\nFlame Clocks and Ferronises were built...
0-1304	Now I learn it was at Moebius's base...\nMaybe ignorance was bliss, eh?
0-1305	What should we do about the education\nprogram for our trainees? Things have\nchanged a lot recently, as you well know.
0-1306	Why not keep it as is for the first three terms?\nThey'll need the basic conditioning if we want\nthem to survive, whichever way things go...
0-1307	We should totally join the Guard!
0-1308	Yeah! That way, we can watch over\nHer Majesty and be her shield.
0-1309	You really want to join the Guard?\nBut there are so many other roles\nyou could choose from!
0-1310	I really do, though. I wanna\ngrow up to be like Heath.
0-1311	Are we training at Gardin\nDefense Base again?
0-1312	Yep. We gotta make ourselves stronger\nso we can protect our true Queen.
0-1313	You know that image Stefaan created,\nwith the weird colors? Apparently it's\nbeing valued at 200,000G!
0-1314	You serious?! Maybe I should try making one.\nIf nothing else, it looks kinda fun...
0-1315	Ulrich went up to Agnus Castle, didn't he?\nSnuff-ton of intel and knowledge to steal,\nover there.
0-1316	They'll be able to "steal" a lot of info from us\ntoo, you know. Either way, I'm hoping this\nthing will benefit everyone...
0-1317	Luciona and her gang weren't\nable to keep up with the times.
0-1318	Sure, but still, I can't really sympathize.\nThey did things they weren't supposed to\nand got their just deserts for it.
0-1319	Man, what's up with them? Why just up\nand change the rules at this stage...?
0-1320	All that fighting I did to make it to\nHomecoming, and now I don't even\nget to have one...?
0-1321	I think we'll need the power of the Queen\nto make sure we don't raise any ruffians\nlike Luciona in the future.
0-1322	That's why we need someone to\nrule over us. We can't face down\nopposition all by ourselves.
0-1323	I heard the Guard temporarily blocked all\ntraffic in and out of the Castle. You know\nanything about that?
0-1324	Some spark-raisers among them in there.\nEven the Captain of the Guard's on edge...\nWay calmer when we had the Consul, man.
0-1325	I recently go to sell food to Agnian soldiers,\nbut there many more than before! So many,\nthat run out of product to sell...
0-1326	Methinks, they need large numbers\nbecause looking for someone.
0-1327	Big crashy noise was big spook.\nTurns out, nearby cliff toppled over.
0-1328	Super lucky we not flattened\nto pancake right now.
0-1329	Collectibles sell, but for not high prices.
0-1330	Therefore, better to keep on hand.
0-1331	Fornis region teeming of Glitter Radishes,\nripe for plucking!
0-1332	Not such good news. Too many radish\nmeans they be unrare article. Not sell\nfor good profit!
0-1333	Become better friend with caravan\nNopon, and they offer more wider\nrange of service.
0-1334	Colony work on similar principle - good\nrelations bring good treatment.
0-1335	Not long ago, spot place with red smoky\nfumes... Was container with many sparkly\nthingies to get grubby wings on!
0-1336	What a luckypon! Such container\nusually crowded by Keves or Agnus\nsoldiers.
0-1337	Me went to every sort of place in Aionios, but\nmonsters lurking near old Ferronis here were\nbiggest, bashiest monsters me ever seen.
0-1338	Those friends giant heropons for\ngiving scary monsters well deserved\nbash on head.
0-1339	Still stubborn enough to stay here?\nBut surely, end up dead snowpon,\nout in chilly cold.
0-1340	Meh! Fluffy Nopon not weak against cold!\nFluff, fur, and feathers keep out chill!
0-1341	Friend heard of strange\nroom in Colony Omega?
0-1342	Meh? Nope. Is warmer than here?\nIf so, zip there all speedy-like now\nwould be great plan!
0-1343	Thank to research, now we know that\ncertain collectible items easier to get\nfrom Fabricator than from nature.
0-1344	Right! If need getting wings on sneaky,\nelusive Collectible, worth trying luck with\nFabricator, meh.
0-1345	This area revive nasty memory every time.
0-1346	Memory of being stalked by\nmask man drenched in scary black.\nFur shiver just recalling.
0-1347	Think customers will come to\nedge of scorchy desert like this?
0-1348	Even now, yes... Though not sure they in\ngreat hurry to purchase sandy merchandise.
0-1349	It now come to mind Erythia Sea\nalso possess island, all sand-ridden,\nlike Dannagh Desert!
0-1350	Oh! Imagine it fun much to\nclimb to top of sand dune!
0-1351	Could not flap wing any faster to escape\nscary Ignas that chasing little old me.
0-1352	It no good to only flap wing like scaredy Feris.\nTry craft gem and improve equipment, then\nfight back, like Volff!
0-1353	Darbus so big and terrifying. No way\nI travel to Rae-Bel Tableland with mind\nof peace.
0-1354	Soon, some friend or other come and bash\nsilly monster on head, with surety.
0-1355	Meh... Me used up every last ether cylinder...
0-1356	Is own fault for not keeping eye out.\nIf see ether channel somewhere, is best to\ncollect while collecting is good!
0-1357	Methinks "Kilocorn Grandeps" is\nstrongest monster of these part.
0-1358	Agree much. Someone must come bash\nscary monster on head, super-speedy.
0-1359	I move here from inside cave.\nCustomer abundant in cave, but\ncramped, and sales underwhelming...
0-1360	And nasty black fog everywhere, not\nlike here, where it more pleasant.
0-1361	Found Nopon Coin! Then stuffed\ninto suitable container.
0-1362	Mind at ease then. Burrburr\nno need for grumble now.
0-1363	Just bit further ahead, set shop up.\nOne last push!
0-1364	Miss wing-made cuisine much!\nSo tiring to eat raw fruits and veggies...
0-1365	Now is time for make-do. But when day\noff arrives, can go Colony Lambda to stuff\nbellies silly with proper food!
0-1366	It said, long ago, Zoka got opportunity to\ntaste cuisine made by legendary Nopon.\nSaid to be tasty beyond imagining!
0-1367	Zoka so lucky... Make me jealous...
0-1368	Is ether cylinder topped up?
0-1369	Meh, not quite. Will enter Urayan Tunnels\nto swipe teensy bit of ether. Back in not\nlong, OK?
0-1370	This place well suited for fishing fishies!
0-1371	Certainly! Once done fishing loads\nof fishies, wise to sell them at Lambda.
0-1372	Maktha Wildwood is next location along path.
0-1373	It dangerous, so wise to buy surplus of\nitems, and prepare well for road ahead.
0-1374	Ever been in lower level of\nMaktha Wildwood?
0-1375	That even more dangerous place, friends.\nIt have super dangerous cave deep inside\nlower level.
0-1376	Great view of Great Sea had from here!
0-1377	Most spectacular view indeed!
0-1378	Never hear even whispers of such\nterrifying thing that lurk under\nGreat Sea!
0-1379	Most awful view! Better flapping\nwings to save own fur!
0-1380	For millennium, Tirkins and Gogols trade\nbashes on head in Maktha Wildwood, so\ntake care not to catch in crossfi-
0-1381	Wait, friends already been through, and\nstill not in pieces? That impress me much.
0-1382	Origin attack land very near, put bangy\nexplodey noises in drum of ear.
0-1383	Maybe some spot now\nunfamiliar due to this.
0-1384	Only one time in blue moon see\ncustomer come to place like this.
0-1385	But no worry. Whether friend Agnian spy\nor scheming baddie is no fur off traderpon\nback. Doing of business is priority.
0-1386	Whopping big gun thing that formerly stuck to\nCastle took whopping big tumble recently!
0-1387	Could it be work of friends? Very\ncrazy-brained of friends, if that is case!
0-1388	Castle now resemble place in different\ndimension, and maybe time.
0-1389	Must be work of friends, no? It great\ndeed of friends, if that is case!
0-1390	Did friend know? Bashing sea monster bring\nmore reward than bashing land monster!
0-1391	Knew not! Must scribble down quick\nmemo in notebook to not forget!
0-1392	It bit far, but how about go\nPatulia Bay for explore?
0-1393	Castle liberated now...\nLikely to make big fun.
0-1394	That Api... Is off doing fun thing, as usual.
0-1395	Api say, latest plan is to go\nway more east than Ishan Isle.
0-1396	Oh, so wish of selling ware on\nbreezy, buoyanty boat on sea top.\nIs such Levnis existing possibly?
0-1397	Meh-meh. Personally, more of\nland-based Nopon. Not much\ninclined to build such Levnis.
0-1398	Want see how Lost Number eyepatch\nlook like on Nopon...
0-1399	Eyepatch so roguish and cool!\nNext time meeting, will ask Samon\nto give one for sure.
0-1400	Origin shard not just thing that lie around\non ground, menacey monster carry them too.
0-1401	Shard sell for good price if friends\nget wings on and sell to Samon.
0-1402	No noisy racket to disturb blissful\nquiet here. Perfect beddy-bye spot.
0-1403	We not here to put feet up.\nFocus on objective!
0-1404	Attack fly out from Great Sea\nand bashed island to east!
0-1405	Oh? Me not noticed. Must still have\nbeen in middle of beddy-bye...
0-1406	Tch, can't stand the sight of those Moebius\nbootlickers lurking around in our City...
0-1407	Think we can do anything to\nkick the bastards out...?
0-1408	Those Colony 15 kids were fighting each\nother over food at Michiba Canteen.
0-1409	There's lively, and then there's *lively*,\nif you know what I mean, and they seem\nto be the latter. Who could've thought?
0-1410	That Torto may be incredibly stupid, but\nhe is incredibly strong, I'll give him that!
0-1411	You don't mind him playing with us again,\ndo you? It's super fun when he's around.
0-1412	I don't mind at all! Let's invite him\nthe next time we meet up with Shiner\nfor hide-and-seek!
0-1413	I don't get a good vibe coming out of\nPergas, what with him never-ever saying\na single thing...
0-1414	Huh? Y'know, I heard him say "this is\ntasty", all real quiet-like, when we had\nlunch earlier!
0-1415	Get out! So you're telling me that his\nvoice is just stupidly quiet then?!
0-1416	I've been seeing a lot of newcomers\nwalking around in the City lately.\nIt's a surreal sight, I must say.
0-1417	I've been alive longer than most, and\nI can tell these are strange times indeed.
0-1418	So, I went to Michiba Canteen...\nThey took ages to serve my food though!
0-1419	Yeah? What happened to all those\nColony 15 kids who're supposed to\nbe working there now?
0-1420	Me not see Colony 15 friends\nso much recently.
0-1421	I imagine they ultimately found it too\ndifficult to live here, and moved elsewhere.
0-1422	Those funny guys from Colony 15 haven't\nbeen round to play with us lately...
0-1423	It's real lonely without them. I haven't\nseen them anywhere in the City.
0-1424	We're all going out to gather up some food\nsupplies. Just make sure that you gather\nup other things besides fish, OK?
0-1425	Got it!
0-1426	You know, who was it that came with that\nwhole "Trust your crew, trust yourself" thing\nto go with our salute?
0-1427	I'd say Fifi, probably? Still, whatever\nit's supposed to mean, it sure gets\nyou psyched up.
0-1428	Once you get a taste of Lotus's fish\npies, you'll be through your tenth before\nyou even know it.
0-1429	They make you ready to take on anything!
0-1430	So the fish pie's meant to be\na little snack, right...?
0-1431	Snack? It's a staple here.\nWould you eat fish as a *snack*?
0-1432	So, like, yesterday when I was patrolling\nthe Erythia Sea, I saw a Shoox.
0-1433	It was so cute the way it came flapping\nits little fins over to my boat.
0-1434	I've so had it with Urchon extermination\nduty. Their spikes hurt like a mudder!
0-1435	You think so? I think their spikes are really\ncute. And Urchon are tasty to boot.
0-1436	It's up to all of us to protect\nthe colony while Fifi's out.
0-1437	So, no distractions, yeah?\nKeep on your toes.
0-1438	So, out of Lan-Lan and Googoo,\nwho do you think's cuter?
0-1439	Lan-Lan has the cuter nickname, I'd say.\nThough it's a shame he always feels like\nhe has to have an answer for *everything*.
0-1440	Tussore puts lots of back into work.
0-1441	It's incredible how she turned the Armus\ninto a steady source of food!
0-1442	If Nandun gives you a soft growl\nwhen you pet him, good luck will\nbe bestowed upon you!
0-1443	For reals?! I'll go give him\na pet right now, then!
0-1444	So, you know how Tussore found success\nraising Armus? Well, here's my idea - we\nshould try raising our own monsters too!
0-1445	Then how about Ferises?\nThey're strong *and* cool.
0-1446	I want Fiona to stay with us forever.\nShe's always cheering us up and\nkeeping us going.
0-1447	But she's got a very important duty to do,\nhelping the Ouroboros. You'll just have to\ngrin and bear it for now.
0-1448	Fifi's out there representing us and fighting\nside by side with the Ouroboros, right?
0-1449	Yup. So for Fifi's and our sakes, we have\nto be less dependent on her.
0-1451	Are we done fighting now that\nthe Flame Clock is gone?
0-1452	I guess so...?\nNothing about it feels real, though...
0-1453	We're not going to need to risk\nour lives in dicey battles any more.\nWe can breathe a sigh of relief.
0-1454	If only this had ended sooner.\nImagine how happy all our fallen\ncomrades would've been.
0-1455	Can you believe that what we thought\nwas a mountain was actually a Ferronis?!
0-1456	Well, Ferronises can move, and mountains\ncan't. Haven't really got a choice but to\nbelieve what we saw with our own eyes.
0-1457	Fiona and the Ouroboros defeated\nthe Consul, right? Does that mean\nshe's not coming back?
0-1458	That's right. And we never had a clue\nabout what she really was like, right till\nthe bitter end...
0-1459	Irma was the Consul all along. And for\nall this time, she was betraying us...
0-1460	Some time's passed now since she died,\nbut no matter how many times I hear it,\nit still doesn't sink in.
0-1461	The Castle's up north, so if we're going to\ngo exploring, we're better off heading east.
0-1462	We'll find the Anu Shoals and Daedal Isle\ngoing east. Hope we can pick up some\nsupplies over there.
0-1463	Aegis Sea in southeast is stronghold\nof Levialord Empireo.
0-1464	We'll need to stay well clear of it then.
0-1465	Gotta go out again, to get some fish!
0-1466	The Castle ain't supporting us any more,\nso we're gonna have to make do with fish\nfor a good long while.
0-1467	Flame Clock not boss of us any more, yet\nme hardly see any happy, smiley faces.
0-1468	The fight may be over for us, but there's\nstill a whole load of problems that need\nsolving before anyone starts smiling.
0-1469	The monsters in the Erythia Sea\nwon't attack us if we ride in\nLevnises or boats, right?
0-1470	Well, yeah. Looks like they haven't\ndeveloped a taste for the mechanical\nyet, thankfully.
0-1471	I got word that we need to be careful\naround Ishan Isle... Pirates been sighted\nnearby, y'see.
0-1472	Huh? Ishan Isle, that's south-east from\nDaedal Isle, right? What's the fuss about?\nNot like we got any reason to go there...
0-1473	Fifi's going with a team to infiltrate\nLi Garte Prison Camp!
0-1474	That's ridiculous. The place is crawling\nwith soldiers. And they're a whole lot\nmore skilled and experienced than us!
0-1475	The Ouroboros even managed to destroy\nthe Castle's Flame Clock!
0-1476	That's awesome! We're witnessing a\nmoment that's going to change the\nworld as we know it.
0-1477	Korresia's accessories are simple,\nbut real cute.
0-1478	What kind of place is Colony Tau?
0-1479	Korresia said it's filled with lots of big\ntrees. I'd like to go visit it sometime\nand see what that's like.
0-1480	Th-that massive thing that was under the\nsea... Isn't it gonna be gunning for us?!
0-1481	We'll just have to do what we can.\nRunning round like headless Flamiis isn't\ngoing to make us any more prepared.
0-1482	We have to protect this colony. Make sure\nit's fit for Fiona to come home to.
0-1483	Spot on. I don't think we can win against\nthat behemoth, but the least we can do is\ngo down with a fight, not a whimper.
0-1484	It's been a long time since we had\na fun party like that.
0-1485	It made for a proper change of pace, all\nright. I haven't laughed so hard in ages!
0-1486	I won't be able to even look at a fish for a\nwhile. And I joked at the party that there'd\nnever be plenty of fish in the sea for me...
0-1487	We're gonna have to find our own food\nstarting from now. How about we go\nhunting at Daedal Isle?
0-1488	It was fun trying to get Point Stickers\nfor my Progress Point Card.
0-1489	I wish I could've become lieutenant. That\nway, I could've gone with Fifi to loads of\ncool places and eaten loads of nice food!
0-1490	Irma was a big presence in our lives.
0-1491	I agree. Appointing a new lieutenant via\nTallow's system just isn't going to work...
0-1492	Grieving about Irma being gone\nisn't gonna change anything.
0-1493	Those of us who survived are just\ngoing to have to bear the burden\nof keeping Colony Mu going.
0-1494	It's crazy how the Consul was there,\namong us, all along.
0-1495	Whatever Moebius have in mind,\nthere's no way of us knowing.
0-1496	How could it have felt for Irma, watching\nus, her friends, die on the battlefield?
0-1497	She seemed incredibly sad about it to me.\nThough perhaps I'm just telling myself\nwhat I want to believe?
0-1498	As an Ardun matures and becomes larger,\nits horns grow and become strong too.
0-1499	Really now? It's the small Armus that I\nlike, myself. I wish the little cuties could\njust stay cute...
0-1500	Go offer some help to Tussore and Lotus\nonce you've got some free time.
0-1501	They said they wanted loads of Armu\nand Ardun food and whatnot.
0-1502	The Ouroboros are\nreal sparking strong, all right...
0-1503	And the six of them are on the same\nlevel as the commander. But still,\nthat's no excuse for us to fall behind!
0-1504	I don't think I realized this before taking\na proper stab at fighting, but we're like,\nactually seriously wimpy, aren't we...?
0-1505	We need to think about how we're gonna\nsurvive first. There's no way we'll be able\nto go toe-to-toe with Moebius.
0-1506	Well I guess not all Consuls\nare complete bores, eh?
0-1507	I was utterly terrified. I was on tenterhooks\nwhen Fiona and the others were out there.
0-1508	Moebius don't seem to get along\nwith each other as well as we do\nhere in Colony Mu.
0-1509	Did you hear that from Triton? He sure\nknows his stuff, doesn't he...?
0-1510	Everybody now go on about this\nautonomonomy thingy.
0-1511	Yeah, I mean, we decided as a group not\nto just leave everything to the commander,\nbut to move forward together.
0-1512	Might be worth helping out the team that's\ngonna go on patrol. Take the place of that\none fella... He's in no state to be doing it.
0-1513	Good point. I'll go discuss it\nwith the patrol team.
0-1514	At first, I didn't feel like things had\ngot better after the Flame Clock\nwas destroyed.
0-1515	But lately, things have started to look up.\nIt now feels like everyone's united and all\naiming towards the same goal.
0-1516	So, you...really don't remember a thing\nfrom before you got attacked?
0-1517	I don't even remember being attacked.\nThat's just terrifying to think about, losing\nyour memory...
0-1518	You think Fiona's OK? It's a real cause for\nconcern that she won't tell us anything.
0-1519	Curse that Consul!\nThe backstabbing snuffer!
0-1520	I wanted to fight too!\nI wanted to...get revenge for Irma...!
0-1521	Irmaaa... (sob)... (sniff)...
0-1522	Fiona must be suffering the most out of us\nall. We've got to support and comfort her...
0-1523	Like...what should we do now?
0-1524	Don't ask me...\nI wouldn't have the first clue.
0-1525	The Flame Clock... It's truly gone.
0-1526	This is a...good thing\nfor us, right? ...Right?
0-1527	Tallow's been working himself to the bone.\nHe wasn't like this before, was he?
0-1528	Could be because Irma's gone now...
0-1529	Do you think...he feels like he has to\nprove himself as our new lieutenant?
0-1530	Tallow's going around with such a\ncondescending attitude lately.
0-1531	I know! The guy's really into\nordering us around, huh.
0-1532	Yeah, I can tell you, I don't care for his tone...\nWe're not his subordinates, after all!
0-1533	Hey, did you hear about what\nhappened between the battle squad\nand Tallow's squad?
0-1534	You mean that huge argument, right?\nAyase and Tallow really haven't been on\nthe best of terms lately, have they?
0-1535	Everyone's acting so irritable.\nIt's pretty sad if you ask me...
0-1536	I don't get what's going on with everyone\nright now. All they do is just talk bad\nabout each other, all the time!
0-1537	Things weren't like this before the colony\ngot liberated, that's for sure.
0-1538	I'd rather go back to the old days if\nthings are going to carry on like this...
0-1539	What happened with Irma came as\na shock, but this ain't no time to be\ndown in the dumps.
0-1540	I'm sick of not being any help to Fiona!\nShe's the one going through the worst of\nit, after all...
0-1541	Too true! It's our turn to be\nstrong and dependable now.
0-1542	Nico and the others have been\nlooking busy, haven't they?
0-1543	There's been a real get-up-and-go attitude\nin the maintenance crew. Guess they must\nwant to feel useful to the colony.
0-1544	That so?! Then why don't we\nlend them a helping hand?
0-1545	All Tussore's been able to talk about\nlately is Armus, Armus, Armus...
0-1546	What's got her so excited about\nthem all of a sudden?
0-1547	I just love fresh milk! It makes you cry\ntears of happiness, it's that tasty!
0-1548	Doesn't it just?! Puts a real spring\nin your step, it does.
0-1549	We've gotta keep working hard on our\nfarming so that everyone in the colony\ncan be just as cheerful as us!
0-1550	You react more sluggishly\nthan an Ardun! Focus!
0-1551	I *am* focusing! I've got to get\nbetter and stronger so I can\nprotect everyone in the colony!
0-1552	Did you hear about Ayase's plan?!
0-1553	I did! It's a little scary, not gonna lie, but\neither way, let's make sure it's a success!
0-1554	The squad captains aren't bickering\nwith each other any more!
0-1555	Thank goodness for that! Everyone in\nColony Mu can now work together as one!
0-1556	All done! There's nothing like the shine\nof something that's brand spanking new,\nis there?
0-1557	It took a whole lot of effort, but\nit was well worth it in the end.
0-1558	And what a job we did. There's nothing\nwe can't do if we put our minds to it!
0-1559	Those Armus are so muscular!\nIt's incredible!
0-1560	You think they're even stronger than us?
0-1561	You ever get the impression that Mikaela's\nbecome a little more dependable...?
0-1562	I do, now you mention it! She's been\nworking on refining her understanding\nof battle strategy, too.
0-1563	It's the first time I've seen her attack while\ndefending too. She'll have to keep up the\ntraining to master it, though!
0-1564	Well? Do you think it can be fixed?
0-1565	It most certainly can! It'll take a little\nbit longer though, that's all.
0-1566	If even Kanata's in high spirits,\nI think we'll manage just fine!
0-1567	I'm done here, so I can help you out!
0-1568	You're a lifesaver!
0-1569	If we all work together, we'll get it\ndone in no time flat!
0-1570	Another of Tallow's conferences\npulled a massive crowd!
0-1571	He must be totally swamped right now!
0-1572	There's so much stuff he wants to do!\nIf only there were 40 hours in a day...
0-1573	Today's another day that's going perfectly\nfor me! It feels so good to be alive!
0-1574	Hey, I had a thought... How about we start\nplanting flowers when something good\nhappens, as well...?
0-1575	Great idea! I'd love to see the colony\nall covered in flowers.
0-1576	Let's discuss it with Fiona, then!
0-1577	The harvest's already just\na few months away.
0-1578	That's right. It'll yield plenty of food for us to\neat soon enough, so sit tight and relax.
0-1579	How many years has it been since we've\ncaught sight of anyone from the outside?
0-1580	I've never seen people from outside\nat all! This is my first time seeing some\nactual Kevesi people.
0-1581	So, I tried making tea from\nSaffronia blossoms...
0-1582	Wow, that sounds like it'd be a very pretty\ncolor! You must let me have a sip next time.
0-1583	Hey, is it true we have enemies\nheading our way...?
0-1584	It is. We're no battle specialists, so we\nmay just have to say goodbye to this\nlittle lifestyle we built up...
0-1585	We've gotta sear this view into our minds.\nHold on to it...
0-1586	I'm going to fight till the bitter end! ...I'll\nprobably get walloped in the first few\nseconds, but you know what I mean.
0-1587	I'm gonna check on the Gromrice\ntomorrow to see how it's doing.
0-1588	Sure thing. I'll go do some fishing then.
0-1589	Feels like, with that Ferronis completely\ndestroyed, we're probably not going to be\ndiscovered here.
0-1590	We can breathe easy for now. Once\nwe've harvested the Gromrice, we'll need\nto throw a feast to thank those guys.
0-1591	Those outsiders that Nimue brought\nback with her did us a huge favor...
0-1592	A favor we've gotta return. Whatever the\nchief may say about them, I'd feel bad if\nI didn't do something for them at least.
0-1593	Where did you go off to yesterday?
0-1594	To the warehouse. The lovely view\nover there had me in a trance.
0-1595	Seems like the outside world's been\ngetting a lot noisier, hasn't it?
0-1596	Keep yourselves safe out there.\nOtherwise, we won't be able to\nreturn the favor to you someday.
0-1597	I had a little look at the outside world...\nYou guys are going to fight that massive\nthing, aren't you...?
0-1598	Although we may be of no help in a fight,\njust know that we'll always be your ally.\nLet us know if you ever need anything.
0-1599	Those Agnian mudders looked down\non us from here while we toiled for\nthem like slaves.
0-1600	I get how you feel, but right now, us and\nthem are just gonna have to play nice.
0-1601	How are we going to secure food and\nsupplies now that the labor force from the\nLi Garte Prison Camp is gone?
0-1602	Well, we can't tell 'em to go back to work\nagain, that's for sure. We're gonna have\nto figure something out and fast.
0-1603	They say in the past, the City was pretty\nclose to where Li Garte Prison Camp is now.
0-1604	So we stole that land and built a prison\nto lock them up there? It beggars belief!
0-1605	So the City was once\nobliterated by Moebius?
0-1606	It was, yes. But now that we've\ngot our land back, the time's finally\ncome for us to strike back...
0-1607	I was told by Aggy that\nGhondor loves eating fish.
0-1608	Well, I was told by Oggy that she loves\neating meat. They can't both be right,\ncan they...?
0-1609	Is it Aggy that's correct, or Oggy?
0-1610	If I were you, I'd go and ask\nGhondor to be sure.
0-1611	Why are the Ouroboros and Lost Numbers\nmilling around here, in our Castle?
0-1612	Because we lost, innit. Though\nI'd say they liberated us, personally.\nNot a bad thing in my opinion.
0-1613	We gave the call to all Agnian colonies,\nbut we've had no reply so far.
0-1614	They still must be within Moebius's control,\nthen. We'll need to destroy more Flame\nClocks to bring more allies to our side.
0-1615	Isn't that a job for logistics? Because it\nsure isn't a job for intel.
0-1616	Oh, come the snuff on. Intel hasn't got\nanything to do at the moment, right?\nTell them to help us out, will ya?
0-1617	Are the Levnises from the Levnis Workyard\nstill not ready for pickup?
0-1618	Putting the ordnance corps in control of\nthat place was a mistake. No amount of\nfoot soldiers can stand up to a Levnis.
0-1619	Never did I imagine that the "Queen"\nwe knew was just a double...
0-1620	Not to mention the Consuls were up to\nsome nonsense too! My whole world's\nbeen turned upside down...
0-1621	I heard what happened. So this is what\nit's like without a Flame Clock, huh?
0-1622	Nothing about it feels too off, does it?\nAnd now we don't need worry about\nhow much juice the clock's got.
0-1623	It's so interesting seeing\nhow Ghondor fights.
0-1624	Even though she just uses normal attacks,\nshe gets in so many hits, so quickly, the\nenemy's a pulp before they know it.
0-1625	They used to execute people in this place,\non the day of the eclipse.
0-1626	We owe it to all who lost their lives here\nto ensure that nothing like that can ever\nhappen again.
0-1627	So now, the Lost Numbers and Keves\narmy are going to join hands with the\nguys they've been killing all this time?
0-1628	It must be clear to you now who our\ntrue enemy really is, right? If we don't\njoin forces, we're all as good as dead.
0-1629	Go out the the west gate, you're in the\nAetia region. Now, past the east gate, that's\nthe Levnis Workyard. With me so far?
0-1630	Cool, thanks for the directions!
0-1631	You can get straight to the Central Harbor\nfrom the Mulus Depot.
0-1632	But the Armory Levnises have all been\ntaken out, so you'll only be able to borrow\na boat from there.
0-1633	But if we could still use the Annihilator...\nCould we just whack Origin with it and\ncall it a day...?
0-1634	Now's the time for patience.\nWe'll strike against that snuffer\nonce the true Queen has returned.
0-1635	That giant machine in the Great Sea\nwas under it the whole time, wasn't it?
0-1636	And it's bigger than even our Castle.\nJust how in the ever-living snuff does\nthat kind of engineering work...?
0-1637	So our true Queen is safe now?
0-1638	Yeah. According to the Lost Numbers'\nintel, she is. I can't wait to meet her.
0-1639	I'd say that the Cloudkeep and\nthis Castle share some design\nand construction similarities.
0-1640	They must've been built at\naround the same time then?
0-1641	So all this time, the Queen was secretly\nhidden above Captocorn Peak...
0-1642	She was so close to us, and yet so far.
0-1643	Haven't the Lost Numbers pulled out yet?
0-1644	They said we had too many of them\nheld here for them to all fit on Levnises,\nby the sounds of it.
0-1645	How many more days are the\nLost Numbers staying here?
0-1646	Food supplies are a big worry, with\nthis many people around. Couldn't they,\nlike, send half of their numbers off first?
0-1647	I tell you, I'm relieved to see the Lost\nNumbers finally getting out of here.
0-1648	Enough of that. They're our allies now,\nyou hear? You're gonna have to meet\nthem halfway, sooner or later.
0-1649	You really sure we shouldn't have gone\nback to the City with the others...?
0-1650	Ghondor and the others are staying behind,\nthings will be just fine. Here's where I want\nto contribute to the City.
0-1651	We can trust Seeker. He's nicer and\nmore honest than Ghondor.
0-1652	Whoa, what if Ghondor hears you?!\nShe'll dropkick you to the other side\nof Aionios if you're not careful!
0-1653	It's hard work scavenging up food.
0-1654	Little wonder we forced the Lost Numbers\nto do it for us, all those years...
0-1655	I hear we can't get in touch with Dana's boat.
0-1656	All the thick black fog in the Erythia Sea\nmust be disabling our comms. Let's just\nhope that's the only thing going on.
0-1657	Of course, we just had to lose radio\ncontact with the ship that's got the food\nsupplies we worked so hard to gather...
0-1658	Losing food's obviously annoying,\nbut I'm more worried about those\nLost Numbers right now.
0-1659	How can Dana be dead? Nothing could\nstop her at the Prison Camp, so how\ncould she just die like that, so easily?
0-1660	The Castle may be liberated,\nbut the fight's far from over, it seems...
0-1661	That Ragzy mudder isn't gonna\nget away with this!
0-1662	You got that right. All that trust we had\nbuilt up with the City is going to go up in\nflames, thanks to what he's done.
0-1663	The Lost Numbers have become our\ncomrades... Hearing one of them's dead\nreally cut me to the quick.
0-1664	Can't believe we've got to hold an old friend\naccountable for killing a newer one...\nIt's surreal.
0-1665	You're saying those three fiends\nhave been released? Snuff me,\nwhat is Seeker thinking...?
0-1666	It seems like the charges against them\nwere false. The Consuls locked 'em up\n'cause of some grudges, I'd wager.
0-1667	You're saying those three fiends\nhave been released? Snuff me,\nwhat is Seeker thinking...?
0-1668	I guess that means the Ouroboros taught\nthem a lesson they'll never forget. And if\nthat's true, there's nothing to worry about.
0-1669	Looking back at it now, those three\n"fiends" didn't really do anything\nall that fiendish, did they?
0-1670	Yeah, we all just accepted what the Consuls\nsaid without a second thought. But now, it\nfeels we're starting to understand the truth.
0-1671	Ever since we started mixing with the Lost\nNumbers, the number of Keves inspectors\nhas gone up and caught us unawares.
0-1672	And that means the possibility of an enemy\nspy lurking among us. Let's have someone\nkeep an eye on them.
0-1673	Even now, there are Kevesi\nwho still resent us.
0-1674	Not easy to join hands with a former\nenemy, is it? There're people on our\nside who're just the same.
0-1675	Ulrich isn't the type to hide things from\nus. I can guarantee you he was misled\nby Luciona.
0-1676	Yeah. He's a good lad, so we're\nall in agreement here too.
0-1677	Ulrich told me the City is a place unlike\nanything he could've ever imagined.
0-1678	Hope we can go there someday.\nI wanna try one of those "novels"\nSeeker told us about.
0-1679	We may be working together with Keves\nand the City now, but will it be enough\nto defeat Moebius?
0-1680	We've got a better chance working\ntogether than we'd have otherwise.\nIt's better than nothing, at least.
0-1681	Apparently, these "children" they\ntalk about in the City are even\nsmaller than the first-termers.
0-1682	So I heard. What on Aionios is\nup with that? I'd like to see one of\nthose mysterious beings for myself...
0-1683	Hey, did you hear? An Agnian\narranged us a boat to the City.
0-1684	I heard. Some guy called Seeker, right?\nWhy did he go and do something for us that\nwouldn't benefit him in any way?
0-1685	Agnians are being untrustworthy, as usual.\nI haven't got a clue what's going on\ninside their heads.
0-1686	Shh! Do you really think it's wise to be\nspeaking like that in their territory?!
0-1689	Do we have enough firepower to defeat\nAgnus if we end up fighting them...?
0-1690	They ain't gonna start anything while\nGhondor's keeping an eye on them,\nthat much is certain.
0-1691	Good grief... I've only just gone and lost my\nsense of direction, that's how busy I've\nbeen. Where should I bring these supplies?
0-1692	Right... I'd imagine you should\nbring them to the supply team.
0-1695	This is just the kind of time I'd like\nthose guys to be here, but alas...
0-1696	Tohma, Xera and Jhodor are locked up\ndeep inside the prison, after all. They won't\nbe seeing daylight any time soon.
0-1699	Have you heard about those crazy strong\nguys? The ones that were locked up in\nprison for yonks?
0-1700	Yeah, I did. The guys over in internal\nsecurity will be run ragged if they ever\nmanage to get out.
0-1701	I'm still in denial... Dana promised us we'd\nall go back to the City together.
0-1702	It was those Agnians that did her in.\nI ain't gonna let them bastards get\naway unscathed, believe you me.
0-1703	They said something about us being\nsummoned to the City. Only thing is,\nI don't even know where the place is.
0-1704	Well, if they're summoning us over there,\nI bet they're looking for someone to blame...
0-1707	Hey, what kind of Blade did\nyou end up choosing?
0-1708	A gun type, I guess. My dad said I had more\npromise with 'em than with swords...
0-1709	The Lost Numbers are short on snipers,\nright? It's just that I've been considering\nchanging my role, is all.
0-1710	You're changing your Blade *again*? Are\nyou really sure you've found the right role\nthis time?
0-1711	My husband surprised me with a hug last\nnight while I was doing dishes. I was so\nstartled, I accidentally summoned my Blade!
0-1712	Seems like old age hasn't dulled your\nsoldierly instincts, eh? Hohoho!
0-1713	I found myself arguing with an Ortiz recently\nabout what Torpedo wrap is the tastiest.\nThing is, I didn't even know he was an Ortiz...
0-1714	Careful... Don't get on the wrong side of a\nbig cheese from the Six Houses, will ya?
0-1715	So there I was in Michiba Canteen,\ngrumbling about the conservatives...\nwith a Doyle in earshot.
0-1716	I was scared he was gonna have a go at\nme, but shockingly enough, he paid for my\nmeal. Perhaps the Doyles aren't so bad...?
0-1717	You should always have some\nextra armor on you whenever you\nventure out from the City.
0-1718	I know, OK? And before you ask, I always\nmake sure I'm properly fitted with the best\nweapons, too, so I'll be just fine.
0-1719	When I get bigger, I want to be someone\nwho designs cute clothes.
0-1720	Cool! Maybe I'll be a\nTorpedo wrapsmith...
0-1721	I sooo want some new clothes...
0-1722	You might have to be a bit patient...
0-1723	Daddy, Daddy! Could we get this book?
0-1724	Sure thing, champ. And what a good choice!\nThat'll probably help with your studies.
0-1725	Once upon a time in a land far, far away-
0-1726	Isn't there a different story you\ncould tell me? I've heard that one\nso many times already...
0-1727	You wanna head over to Michiba Canteen\nfor a round or few?
0-1728	For goodness' sake, you really need to\nget yourself a job. All you ever do is drink\nand stay at home all day reading books...
0-1729	You've got another thing coming if you\nthink I'll cooperate with you, lad. House\nVandham ain't getting no help from me.
0-1730	I just want to spread your wisdom to the\nyounger generation - for the sake of the\nwhole City. Noble cause, don't you think?
0-1731	So you know how they carted the Vandham\nperson and that Doyle to the Medical Facility\nat once? What d'ya think happened then?
0-1732	Given that House Rhodes is a neutral party,\nI'm sure they would've saved them both...\nThat said, I'd wager some trouble is afoot.
0-1733	My mum told me I can't\nplay with you any more.
0-1734	Aw, but we're best buds now!\nYou can't dump me just because\nour parents don't get along...
0-1735	Monica cannot be trusted in the role of\nElder. I don't think I've ever known the\nCity to be in such a precarious situation.
0-1736	Right you are, my dear. As descendants of\nthe Founders, we must ensure that their\nbloodline continues to thrive.
0-1737	Oof, my bruises have bruises and my aches\nhave aches... Is it me or has the training been\nparticularly vicious lately?
0-1738	With the Ouroboros around, I guess they're\nexpecting Moebius to get more rowdy too...
0-1739	I love the Founders' Tale series, but\ncollecting it has left me with less and\nless space in my room.
0-1740	Unless you somehow get a great big place\nlike a big shot from the Six Houses, you'll\nhave to throw some of those books out.
0-1741	How are we doing for eyepatches?
0-1742	We weren't able to recover too many, but we\nshould be able to make some new ones with\nthe Origin shards Gray picked up.
0-1743	I wish I could be as capable as\nGray and get assigned to missions\ngoing all around Aionios...
0-1744	Those secret missions aren't for the weak-\nhearted. They're one-man affairs by nature,\nso they require immense mental resilience.
0-1745	That portrait that's hanging up on the\nMedical Facility wall... It was painted\nby a renowned artist now, wasn't it?
0-1746	It was. It's a wonderful little piece...\nas long as you turn a blind eye to\nthe subject of the portrait, that is.
0-1747	Wellwell say that coming-and-up\nartist is actually Kevesi!
0-1748	That explains why that\npicture's so realistic then.
0-1749	I'm gonna get Torto to teach me\nhow to wield a Blade next time!
0-1750	I'll be taking lessons from Orson.\nI'm so excited to learn from him!
0-1751	The young'uns from Colony 15 were kind\nenough to carry my luggage for me. Saved\nmy poor aching back from breaking in two!
0-1752	A nice, considerate bunch of kids, they\nare. Though they could afford to work on\ntheir a manners a little, it must be said.
0-1753	All the Colony 15 kids are\ndoing Lost Numbers work\nlike it's second nature now.
0-1754	They've lived their whole lives through\nconstant war up to now, so it's reassuring\nto see them settling in so well.
0-1755	Recently, Michiba Canteen service\ntime is super speedy! They serve\nlike tomorrow not coming!
0-1756	The new staff they got in have been just\noutstanding. It does feel as if there's a bit\nmore of a racket in the place now, mind.
0-1757	Can kids like them really be Ouroboros?
0-1758	They made short work of that brand-new\nweapon that Keves deployed, though. That\nalone makes me hopeful for them.
0-1759	Outsiders becoming Ouroboros...\nIs that, like, OK?
0-1760	Well, they've got stacks more battle\nexperience than the candidates we have\nhere. All we can do now is trust them.
0-1761	What do we do if the Ouroboros\ndecide to double-cross us and leak\na load of City intel?
0-1762	But their enemy's Moebius, just like us.\nThey got the seal of approval from the\nElder too, so why're you so worried?
0-1763	Those candidates are just\nnot up to scratch, are they?
0-1764	Whatever thunder they may have had has\nbeen stolen by a bunch of total unknowns.
0-1765	They deployed who knows how many\nArmories to save the Ouroboros... They must\nhave stuck out like a red-raw, sore thumb!
0-1766	Yes, I'm concerned too! They're called the\n*Lost* Numbers for a reason. I hope we don't\ncome to regret using all those Levnises...
0-1767	We're not allowed to hide\ninside the Memorial Hall.
0-1768	Otherwise we'll make the spirits of the\nFounders who live there angry, right?
0-1769	These Ouroboros hail from both Keves\nand Agnus. That means they'll only live\nuntil they're 20, doesn't it?
0-1770	I doubt they've got a lot of time left, then...\nMaybe the current candidates have a hope of\ngetting in on the action after all...?
0-1771	So, did anything change with\nthe Keves and Agnus armies?
0-1772	Not really. They're still locked in\na never-ending war, if that's what\nyou're wondering?
0-1773	What's behind the increase in\nthe Lost Numbers' budget?
0-1774	I'd wager it's the appearance of the\nOuroboros, plus the fight against\nMoebius going up another notch.
0-1775	The first thing you have to do to become a\nLost Number, is to get yourself in shape.
0-1776	I want to grow up to be just like Monica!\nBut I'll have to study and train hard if I'm\never going to be like her...
0-1777	Sentry units are what keep the City safe.\nJust make sure they're well looked after!
0-1778	Meh! Work night and day on Sentry, so\nwell aware of duty, thankings-very-much!
0-1779	Our mission today will be to capture\none single Kevesi Levnis.
0-1780	We've only been assigned one Mercenary\nfor the mission, so let's make sure it comes\nback in one piece.
0-1781	We managed to procure a great deal\nof growth modules this time round. The\nmost we've ever gotten at once, I think.
0-1782	Now that we've entered the heart of it,\nwe have to keep adding to the good\nresults we've attained so far.
0-1783	Let's go get some Torpedo wraps to eat.\nI'm going for Tasty Sausage!
0-1784	Sausage most off-putting ingredient for\nwrap. Would love to meet Nopon so\nlacking in taste decency, if such exist.
0-1785	Can't get through the day without\nat least one Torpedo wrap.
0-1786	You always have Fluffcream and Skeeter\nsyrup dressing, right? That's not the kinda\nthing you should be eating every day...
0-1787	Yo, I heard you were getting married.\nWhy did you hide that from me?\nI thought we were mates!
0-1788	Wh-whoa, calm yourself.\nIt's not what you think!
0-1789	My mum needs me for something tonight.\nSorry to turn you down...
0-1790	It's fine, it's fine. I was only really asking\nyou over to listen to me moan about my\nboyfriend anyway.
0-1791	Our weapons can't defeat Moebius, so\nwherever the Ouroboros came from, I sure\nam grateful to have them on our side.
0-1792	Me too. The time to take the offensive\nmight be just around the corner.
0-1793	So, the last time we went outside the City,\nI totally lost my eyepatch... Or, should I say,\nthe eyepatch I borrowed from the captain...
0-1794	Some Lost Number you are! What if you'd\nbeen discovered by Moebius?!
0-1795	Thanks to the Ouroboros bunch, the Castle\nhas been liberated. Finally! Those Moebius\nmust be quaking in their boots now.
0-1796	I can imagine. But we ain't out of the\nwoods yet. Those crafty bastards are\nbound to have some ace up their sleeve.
0-1797	Isn't it premature to start facing off against\nMoebius? The City got eviscerated the last\ntime we did that...
0-1798	How many decades do you think it'll take\nbefore we develop tech that protects us\nfrom that? We'll be dead long before then.
0-1799	I'm afraid that our precious son could\nbe one of the prisoners chosen during\nthe next eclipse...
0-1800	It's like you already chiseled his name on\nhis tombstone, the way you're talking.\nHave some faith. He'll make it.
0-1801	The day of the eclipse is almost upon us...\nIt never does get any easier.
0-1802	I'm just hoping my sis doesn't get chosen...\nBut if it's not her, I know it's just gonna be\nsomeone else's sister, child, or parent...
0-1803	How can there be so many Lost Numbers\nwho got themselves captured by Agnus?\nComplete fools, the lot of them.
0-1804	They're putting their lives on the line\nto protect us and our City. Show some\nrespect and appreciation!
0-1805	Your son got captured by Agnus, I heard.
0-1806	Yes. He's been imprisoned at Li Garte\nPrison Camp. And you know only one person\nhas ever managed to escape that place...
0-1807	Our son's home now. Though he's rather\ndifferent now than he was before the\nwhole affair.
0-1808	What matters is that he's safe now,\nand it's all thanks to Monica and the\nOuroboros' hard work.
0-1813	I can't quite believe all that was going\non while we were locked up!
0-1814	They really did cut you off\nfrom the world while you were\nin prison, didn't they?
0-1815	Is Grandad's name somewhere on here?
0-1816	Yes, it is. He fought alongside\nGuernica Vandham's own father, you know...
0-1817	As a member of the Six Houses, report this\nto Monica: our eyes are on Moebius, but\nprotecting the City is still top priority.
0-1818	That won't convince the Elder at all.\nShe'll just say that we'll have to\nbeat them before they beat us.
0-1819	Please, let's not argue about this here.\nI don't care who's right, Monica or Garrett!
0-1822	Monica truly is as much of a hero\nas her father, the great Guernica.
0-1823	His will fully lives on in her.\nSo I should, in theory, feel relaxed\nabout things, and yet I'm not...
0-1824	Little Shania coming home has really lifted\na weight off her mother's shoulders.
0-1825	That's more because she came back with\nresults, surely? House Reid has no option\nbut to place their hopes on her, after all.
0-1826	Have you heard back from the guy yet?
0-1827	No, and I guess that's because he's keeping\na low profile. Last I heard, he was heading for\nMillick Meadows in the Aetia region.
0-1828	Looks like Gray's back in town.
0-1829	It feels like he's softened up a bit. Perhaps\nit's thanks to hanging out with those\nyoung whippersnappers, huh?
0-1830	As long as you're aboard the Boundary,\nyou won't get attacked by any monsters.
0-1831	But if by any chance the ship starts\nto shake, cling to whatever's nearby\nand don't dare let go.
0-1832	Prepare yourselves to roll out\non the Boundary at any time.
0-1833	Depending on how the candidates get on\nwith their operation, we'll be carrying out\nan assault on Patulia Bay.
0-1834	This Sentry just decided to punch me.\nOut of the blue! For no reason!!!
0-1835	That doesn't sound right at all...\nI'll take it back to engineering and\nlet Mr. Samon have a look at it.
0-1836	Mr. Samon's been in charge of\nengineering ever since I was born.
0-1837	Even my Nan calls him Mr. Samon,\nnow that I think about it. Just how\nold is that little fluffball?
0-1840	I noticed Travis was sighing while\nhe was having a Torpedo wrap.
0-1841	He does look drained, doesn't he?\nI bet it's because there's something\nbothering him.
0-1842	Mr. Samon's finally completed the first round\nof calibrations on his test ether furnace.
0-1843	That means we can load it onto the\nnew Boundary, right? I can't wait.
0-1844	Can we really break through\nthe Great Sea's vortex?
0-1845	Well, if we can't, the Ouroboros are\nfinished, and we'll soon follow. We\nhave to believe in Mr. Samon.
0-1846	So this is all because Moebius\nhad been manipulating Aionios\nright from its very core...
0-1847	Damn those pieces of work. I'd love\nto give every each one of them the\nbattering of their lives!
0-1848	The City moved by quite a bit to\ndodge the blast from the Castle.
0-1849	As things stand, there's no coming or\ngoing without using an Armory\nLevnis from Astelle Harbor.
0-1850	Ghondor's our top candidate for a reason,\nall right. She's the one who saved us from\nthat Agnian attack.
0-1851	Well from what I've heard, I'd say we have\nthat one Ouroboros to thank for that.
0-1852	The Elder can relax now that\nGhondor has returned safely.
0-1853	She's a fitting and excellent heir\nfor House Vandham, I'm sure.
0-1854	I found it so scary when the City moved\naround all clanky and rattly-like.
0-1855	Did you know the City was actually\na Ferronis? I couldn't believe what\nI was hearing at first...
0-1856	Nope. That's supposed to be\ntop-secret info, only available\nto members of the Six Houses.
0-1857	Life's going to change a whole lot\nnow that we're stepping our fight\nwith Moebius up a gear.
0-1858	Indeed. Life's not going to be how it was\nwhen we were at the Great Sword.
0-1859	What's it like in Swordmarch now?\nWill we ever go back?
0-1860	Well, where the City was, seems to have\nbeen blown to kingdom-come. You didn't\nleave anything behind there, did you?
0-1861	I went to check out the City's former site,\nand there was this monster I'd never seen\nbefore! My legs nearly buckled from fear...
0-1862	But hey, I made it back in one piece.\nWhat even was that thing, though...?
0-1863	Hey hey, so, my dad came back from an\nexpedition... And guess what! He brought\nme a Fourtune Clover!
0-1864	Whoa, I'm so jelly...\nYou'll have seven in no time!
0-1865	So, I recently talked to the Agnian and\nKevesi soldiers that we took in.
0-1866	And I'll tell you, those kids are all right.\nThey'd be just like any other kids if they\nhadn't been forced to fight each other.
0-1867	After 50 years that Mr. Samon spend\nbuilding Bravery, it finally see light of day.
0-1868	Whoa, whoa, hold on.\nIt only took five years at most.
0-1869	So like, you ready? The City's Ferronis is\nactually called Gilgamesh.
0-1870	That's such a cool name!
0-1871	Putting Gilgamesh onto the gameboard, huh?\nMonica is really throwing caution to the wind.
0-1872	It's the chance of a lifetime to turn things\naround. I'd gladly throw my life to the wind\nif that's what it took for us to win.
0-1873	I wished I could've boarded Origin, too...
0-1874	We don't have that many Armory Levnises\nto spare, I'm afraid. And besides, we've got\na crucial job here, keeping the City safe.
0-1875	Is Moebius really powerful enough\nto move something so big?
0-1876	I'm starting to get scared that we might\nnot to be able beat them monsters...
0-1877	Lately, my dad's been telling me\nto go out and play with all the other\nkids, as much as I like.
0-1878	Yeah, that's kind of what my mum said, too.\n"Make sure you don't have any regrets", like.\nWhaddya think that's about...?
0-1879	We're finally going to get to\nkick some Moebius arse.
0-1880	We've gotta back up the Ouroboros and\nthe Lost Numbers however we can.
0-1881	I'll carry the parts we scavenged\nover to engineering.
0-1882	They'll come in handy for Levnis\nmaintenance and weapons manufacturing.
0-1883	You know Migrow's Rosary, those floating\nislands just in front of the Castle?
0-1884	There's a colony over there too, so look\nafter yourselves. Get found, and they'll be\non you in a flash.
0-1885	All my child ever does is play and play.\nDoesn't even do the slightest bit of\nstudying.
0-1886	My child's just the same. Still, stamina's\nan important attribute to have in becoming\na Lost Number, so it's not all that bad.
0-1887	Mr. Boomer always knows how to\ncrank out a winner of a tune.
0-1888	His songs really give you\nan inner peace of mind.
0-1891	House Doyle can't be doing all that well,\nconsidering what their daughter has been\ngetting up to.
0-1892	I feel for Garrett, I do. Poor man's already\ngot enough on the go with House Vandham...
0-1893	Joulietta's been seeming down lately...
0-1894	I mean, her wedding did get\ncalled off. I'm just hoping she\ndoesn't brood over it too much.
0-1895	I caught sight of Leeanne and the\nOuroboros chatting earlier.
0-1896	Did you now? Perhaps the Founders' Tale\nseries will start picking up the pace now.
0-1897	Have you read the latest volume of\nthe Founders' Tale? It was the most\ngripping one to date!
0-1898	Is that so? Guess I need start\nreading my copy sometime soon.
0-1899	Rozana's been in a good mood lately.
0-1900	Maybe because Gray's back?\nI've never seen a couple as perfect\nfor each other as those two are.
0-1901	There is simply no precedent for\nwelcoming Kevesi into our City.
0-1902	Indeed. They look like type of people who\nenjoy good bout of bashing heads. Teensy\nbit scary, not ashamed to say!
0-1903	They've been out there fighting wars for\nwho knows how long. Will they be able\nto get used to the more peaceful life here?
0-1904	Considering House Vandham and Ortiz\ninvited them in, it's only right that they'll\nhave hell to pay if it goes all pear-shaped.
0-1905	I thought Vane's plan was good. As long\nas there're survivors, the day'll come when\nwe can fight Moebius once again.
0-1906	But have you seen the outside world?\nIt's ruthless. You can't be too careful\nor prepared out there.
0-1907	I don't wanna fight Moebius. Maybe I'll cook\nup some fancy, high-minded pretext to leg it\nout of the City, like Vane did!
0-1908	But the only way this war ends is by\ndefeating Moebius. All we can do now, is\nstand firm and resist those monsters.
0-1909	The daughter of House Doyle made it\nsafely through her first campaign with\nthe Lost Numbers.
0-1910	What does Garrett think of all this? His\ndaughter isn't going down the path he\nthought she would...
0-1911	So I heard Joulietta actually joined the\nLost Numbers, no word of a lie!
0-1912	Maybe she doesn't know how the world\nworks, but good on her for cutting her own\npath through life. I'd love to do the same.
0-1913	We've left the Great Sword, and we're at a\ncompletely different altitude. Not sure my\nbody's adapted to it yet!
0-1914	In that case, you should go speak to Hollis.\nMedicine'll take care of that for you.
0-1915	I bet the Lost Numbers are adjusting just\nfine, since they go outside on missions all\nthe time...
0-1916	I think you'll also get used to the new\nlocation soon enough, but there's always\nmedical if you ever feel under the weather.
0-1917	Oh! It's the Ouroboros! So cool!
0-1918	Rip Moebius a new one!
0-1919	Give 'em everything you got!
0-1920	Samon been more pleasant recently.
0-1921	Is because Samon sat for chat with friend\nof legend. Oh, envy! Want to search for\nhammer and join Nopon of legend too.
0-1922	I'm glad Homecoming was able\nto take place, despite everything\nthat's been happening.
0-1923	Yeah, it's helped me to take my mind\noff things and refocus. I also have to\ncontribute to the City however I can.
0-1924	Those Ouroboros can be thoughtful and\nhelp others out as well. It's made me\nsee them in a different light.
0-1925	They saved Homecoming, just as I thought\nall hope was lost for it going ahead at all\nthis year. I'm so glad for what they did.
0-1926	I wish I was 20 already...\nI wanna have my own room...!
0-1927	So do I! I'd hide all kinds of\ntreasure in mine.
0-1928	This year's Homecoming was different\ncompared to normal, but I enjoyed it\nall the same.
0-1929	It's about the only time you ever get to see\nGarrett and Monica not looking daggers at\neach other...
0-1930	Welcoming those Kevesi soldiers\ninto the City was a huge mistake.
0-1931	I concur. They don't contribute\na single good thing to our City,\nall they bring is trouble.
0-1932	Those kids from Colony 15 are just\nMoebius pawns, are they not?
0-1933	Indeed. They disrupt the orderliness of\nour City and bring conflict and anxiety\nwith them.
0-1934	My mum told me not to play\nwith Orson or his friends.
0-1935	My mum said the same thing... Told me\nthat they were dangerous to be around.
0-1936	We're finally gearing up to defeat Moebius\nonce and for all, and that's when Jaggar\ngoes and dies on us...
0-1937	At least he passed away with\nzero regrets. He was always the\nkind to live life his own way.
0-1938	I did think it was crazy, how many supplies\nthe Castle was sending us, and now it all\nturned out to be the work of those two...
0-1939	Aggy and Oggy, you mean?\nYeahhhh, those dudes will never grow up...
0-1940	Well, it's finally happened - the City, Keves\nand Agnus, all on the same side at last...
0-1941	I can barely believe it. There really\nare other good people out there,\nnot just the Ouroboros.
0-1942	Our next mission's taking us to Agnus\nCastle, right? I'm not sure about this...
0-1943	We'll be fine. Seeker and Ghondor have been\nlaying the groundwork, so I think everyone\nwill be nice and friendly...or else.
0-1944	The Ouroboros candidates\nare pretty cool too, huh?
0-1945	Well, yeah. Especially when a guy like\nKryto is with them! ...So dreamy...
0-1946	Even Jansen and the others are looking\nfor things they can do to help the City.
0-1947	We have to make sure that we help out\ntoo, so they don't outshine us.
0-1948	Did you hear about Jansen\nprofessing his love to the Elder?
0-1949	Can't imagine myself having that much guts...\nThat's our No. 2 candidate for ya.
0-1950	Well, that's Yarmil's hopes\ngone up in flames.
0-1951	It's not like he was ever going to succeed.\nThough to give him his due, I guess he did\nenough to sabotage House Vandham.
0-1952	Reason unclear, but Drumdrum spout\nbig words about defeat big evil and\nprotect peace of City.
0-1953	What do you think she was up to? Like, is\nshe implying there're other dangerous things\nout there besides Moebius?
0-1954	That Monicurry was so good...\nI'm so lucky I even got to try it,\nseeing how I'm not a Lost Number...
0-1955	I can't say the same... The spices burned\nmy mouth to high heaven.
0-1956	Nissick's quite the cook.
0-1957	He really took Ghondor's likes into\naccount when making that dish. He\nlooked like the happiest chappy to me.
0-1958	I wanna have some Doodlenoodles\nnext year too.
0-1959	If there is even going to *be* a next year,\nwe'll have to defeat Moebius first, dear.
0-1960	I thought that Miyabi girl's cooking was the\nbest of the bunch. Good for the soul, it is.
0-1961	Seriously? Still, if her food was just\na teensy bit more showy, I'd have\nprobably thought it was the best too.
0-1962	We need to be on high alert for a Kevesi girl.\nIn particular, keep an eye on all the Armories.
0-1963	That's straight from the Boss's second, and\nour salaries are on the line if we lose a Lev.\n...But why was he crying when he said it...?
0-1964	I'm thinking of leaving the\nLost Numbers. If this keeps up,\nI'll kick the bucket in no time.
0-1965	That Kevesi girl is something special. Just\nwhen you'd think that training would get\nto her, she just kept on going.
0-1966	I'd love to spar with Ethel\nor Cammuravi again.
0-1967	Absolutely. I could really feel my\ntechnique was improving when I was\ntraining with them. They're great teachers.
0-1968	Girls do grow up ever so fast.\nIn the blink of an eye, that Ethel\nbecame much, much bigger.
0-1969	Granny... Uhm, it's because...\nYou see... Oh, I give up.\nYeah, she's just special like that.
0-1970	House Reid is pretty much finished.
0-1971	Guess that makes it the Five Houses now.
0-1972	We should leave House Reid\nalone for the time being.
0-1973	They'll be needing some time to get\ntheir house back in order, as it were.
0-1974	Well, how about that... Shania betrayed us.
0-1975	I'm in utter shock that she would\nsell out the City to Moebius.
0-1976	Shania must have had it rough\nthough, I suppose...
0-1977	That's still not a good reason to go\nattacking the City, you know. That\nwas a truly selfish act that she did.
0-1978	Moebius managed to get to the City, and\nthe Lost Numbers were powerless to do\nanything about it. Now what do we do?
0-1979	We're doing everything we can,\nand I know the Ouroboros are\ncounting on us, but still...
0-1980	If we keep on stealing growth modules\nfrom those Moebius, it'll give them less\navailable soldiers.
0-1981	It's a long and deadly-dangerous process\nthough, isn't it? Still, it's not like we have\nany other choice.
0-1982	This is top secret info here, but I heard\nthat the Ouroboros candidates are going\nto infiltrate the Li Garte Prison Camp.
0-1983	Aww, does that mean I don't get to see Kryto\nfor a while? ...Uh, I mean, hope they all come\nback safely, and soon...
0-1984	Kryto was the star man, I heard.
0-1985	He freed Ghondor and saved all the other\nprisoners from the prison camp, right? I\nwould've loved to see him in action there.
0-1986	Kryto told me that once we dealt with the\nMoebius, we were all going to go out and\nhave a big old feast.
0-1987	That'll be something to look forward to.\nAll the more reason to hope the Elder\nand Ouroboros will succeed at all costs.
0-1988	I very much appreciate the scavenger\nforce retrieving those supplies. It sure\nain't an easy job.
0-1989	They're going to the N'ohm Wetlands next.\nThe fight never stops for them.
0-1990	Are we still waiting on these Levnis parts?
0-1991	Fingers crossed for the next scavenging\nexpedition. If only we could machine the parts\nby ourselves here...
0-1992	Speaking of, I've heard that there are still\nskirmishes popping up between Keves and\nAgnus. You know anything about that?
0-1993	Yeah, the latest one was at the base of\nthe Great Sword. Kabata's been beside\nherself with anticipation.
0-1994	Let's hope everyone comes back from\nthe next scavenging expedition safe\nand sound...
0-1995	Aww... I want to read the\nnext volume so bad...
0-1996	If it's a novel you're after, there's nothing\nbetter than the "Founders' Tale" series.
0-1997	No question there. The author's an\nabsolute genius. Pride of the City,\nI tell ya.
0-1998	Don't tell me you got obsessed\nwith yet another novel...
0-1999	You've got to give it a go, seriously.\nIt's a proper page-turner.
0-2000	Is that novel really so popular?
0-2001	You don't know it? Everyone's\nreading it right now.
0-2002	It's been so hard for Gray's wife,\nhaving to wait for him to return.
0-2003	I feel for her. Gray's always leaving her\nbehind to go on missions, risking life and\nlimb for the City...
0-2006	Who'd have thought Moebius would\nfigure out where the City was...
0-2007	What in the world have the Lost Numbers\nbeen doing all this time to let that happen?!
0-2008	This only happened because\nthe Elder let outsiders come and\ngo into the City, willy-nilly.
0-2009	Still, we were able to live in peace\nfor all this time until now. That's no\nsmall feat, I think.
0-2010	Have you seen what Moebius did to the\nGreat Sword? How on Aionios are we\nsupposed to go toe-to-toe with that...
0-2011	I believed we could take them down with the\nOuroboros's help, but now I think we might\nvery well be better off hiding for our lives.
0-2012	I know we're talking Elder's orders\nhere, but are we really going to be\nable to carry them out?
0-2013	Those monsters have got their eyes\non us, you know. Our peaceful days\nmay well be numbered...
0-2014	What do you think young Joulietta\nhas been up to lately?
0-2015	I've been seeing her around town a lot, now\nthat you mention it. She's probably been\nmeeting up with her lover, I'd say.
0-2016	Who was that girl next to Captain Kabata?\nShe was really cute...
0-2017	Didn't you recognize her? She's the sole\ndaughter of House Doyle, man.
0-2018	I'll tell you what, it's quite something to\nsee Romero going round with a frown.
0-2019	It certainly is, considering he was\nbanging on for months about how\nhe was getting married.
0-2020	Azalea greeted me just a moment ago.\nShe looks a little brighter to me.
0-2021	I think that's because she made\nsome friends. I see her playing in\nthe plaza a lot.
0-2022	Shiner and his friends have been together\na lot recently. What are they up to?
0-2023	They said adults aren't allowed in on\nthe secret. I just hope they're aren't\nup to anything too mischievous.
0-2024	Neon from Mr. Boomer's place\nmade herself a new friend.
0-2025	The new friend's a fan of Mr. Boomer.\nNice to see she met someone with\nsimilar hobbies to her.
0-2026	What I'd do to be a kid again and be\nfriends with anyone, from any faction...
0-2027	But those kids will grow up, and when\nthey do, they'll see the situation for what it\nis and be at each other's throats, I'm sure.
0-2028	San's been hanging out\nwith *those* kids again.
0-2029	But there's perfectly good conservative\nkids he could be playing with... Why must\nhe play with those misfits specifically?
0-2030	You're finally going to be all\ngrown up this year, aren't you!
0-2031	Yeah! Shame there's no\nHomecoming ceremony though...
0-2032	The number of new adults this year is\ngoing to be about six or so, I'd say.\nAnd that also includes Kryto...
0-2033	It's a shame this year's Homecoming got\ncanceled. People were so excited for it,\nespecially Kryto's groupies...
0-2034	Guess we really aren't having a\nHomecoming this year...
0-2035	Aww, does that means there won't be any\nyummy food served to celebrate?
0-2036	Hey, why do you want to watch\nHomecoming so bad, Grandad?
0-2037	My lad, it is a sacred rite. The Founders\ncreated it so we could keep their noble\nambitions alive for generations to come.
0-2038	A Kevesi wouldn't have been my first\nchoice, but I'll give the bird girl credit -\nshe ain't half bad at all.
0-2039	Oh, you mean Eunie?\nI'm with you on that.
0-2040	Wha?! You chose the\ngirl from Keves?
0-2041	Just wait and see, mate. Wait and see.\nFoots must have seen something in her\nfor a reason, you know.
0-2042	These Kevesi instructors may have\nCommander Teach's seal of approval,\nbut I don't know, personally...
0-2043	Mio and the others may be with them,\nbut I mean, they're our enemy...
0-2044	Have you chosen who you\nwant as your instructor?
0-2045	Hmm... I think I'll go with Taion. I do want\nto learn some battle tactics, after all.
0-2046	Should we really be letting ourselves\nbe instructed by Kevesi...?
0-2047	Yo, did you hear that Schoon\nnominated that Kevesi instructor?
0-2048	Oh yeah? Surprisingly brave of her...\nWhat's going on in that head of hers?
0-2049	Speaking of off-seeing, I haven't\nheard any flute playing recently.
0-2050	Yeah... Schoon might not be\npracticing that much any more,\nnow that she's the sole off-seer.
0-2051	Now that Miclan's gone from us, I'm not\nsure if Schoon can carry on as an off-seer.
0-2052	I guess you could say her heart's\njust not in it any more.
0-2053	Look, that Lanz guy... I don't like the\nway he scowls at me! It scares the\nliving daylights of me, it does!
0-2054	Sh-shut it, dunderhead!\nHe'll hear you!
0-2055	That big ol' lump from Keves -\nhe's real intimidating, ain't he?
0-2056	Yeah. Not the kind of guy you\ncan really approach...
0-2057	Namuki from Kyrie's squad is doing\nsome strange research again.
0-2058	He straight up demanded that I let him do\nsome weird medical exam on me! I just\ndon't know what that guy has in his head...
0-2059	That girl's a lucky mudder,\nlet me tell you. I wished Mio\ncould've taught me instead...
0-2060	Didn't win the lottery this time round.
0-2061	Mio's a popular one round here, eh.
0-2062	I just know I'm gonna win the lottery!\nMio's infinite wisdom isn't gonna elude\nme this time!
0-2063	Calm yourself down a few notches,\nwill you? It's not like you can just *decide*\nto win a lottery.
0-2064	Zoren's unit, assemble at the west gate!\nI repeat! Assemble at the west gate!
0-2065	Roger!
0-2066	I got a message from the recon team.\nThey said if we're going to act, now's\nthe best time.
0-2067	That's Captain Zoren for you. Always\ngoing from one battle, straight to the next.
0-2068	You know what's up with Captain Easel?\nShe hasn't been around for a while now.
0-2069	Hmmm. Ask Hexen.\nShe would know, I reckon.
0-2070	I'm famished... What do you think, \ncan I try and nick some food from\nover there?
0-2071	You don't wanna do that, trust me.\nThat's Easel's unit's patch...\nThey don't play games.
0-2072	Easel's unit got a reinforcement request\nfrom Zoren's. What should we do?
0-2073	This is the message I got from the captain:\n"We're busy right now, ignore it".
0-2074	Are them snuffers from Clad's unit\nup to their usual business?
0-2075	If you mean at the training pit,\nthen, yeah. They're really into it, huh...
0-2076	Hey, have you ever seen what\nCaptain Clad's really like, behind\nthat whole captainly facade?
0-2077	As it happens, no... He's the biggest\nenigma out of the Three Ravens, he is.
0-2078	I'm here to report that Easel's unit\nhave some misgivings about how the\nlast battle panned out.
0-2079	Bah... They wouldn't have gotten\nanything done if it wasn't for us taking fire\nfor 'em, the thankless mudders...
0-2080	I'm not sure if there's a clear point to all\nthis hardcore training, to be honest.
0-2081	Yeah, we should probably analyze the\nresults, and adjust the process accordingly.
0-2082	With the Flame Clock gone,\nthe Castle troops need to be united,\nnow, more than ever.
0-2083	I've ironed out all the kinks in my tactical\nplan. The only question now is whether\nregular grunts can pull it off...
0-2084	You could try asking the Captain\nof the Guard what she thinks.
0-2085	Those leaders-in-training are exceptional\nand all that, but they can get on my\nnerves every now and again.
0-2086	Hey, they're the Ouroboros.
0-2087	The Captain of the Guard was searching\nfor them earlier, wasn't she?
0-2088	Heath and Wynonna are both part of the\nGuard. So why do they get on about as\nwell as a Kevesi and Agnian?
0-2089	You know, when is our next training\nsession at the Defense Base?
0-2090	Person in front of Propatheon Cathedral\nbeen drawing curious drawing, recently.
0-2091	I checked out that guy drawing that weird\npicture the other day. He was just staring\nat the ground for ages, looking miserable...
0-2092	I can say it out loud now, but\nhonestly, Consul K was never\nreally my kind of Consul.
0-2093	How much would you pay for that\ncolorful picture thingamajig?
0-2094	Pfft! Not a single G!
0-2098	That's another soldier from the dispatch\nsquad gone missing... Heard they were out\non a mission in the Erythia Sea.
0-2099	There was this white fog, and as soon as\nthey entered - bam - gone. Just like that.
0-2100	I've been seeing a Nopon pulling all-nighters\nin maintenance... Any idea who that is?
0-2101	Pulipuli, of course. The little guy's\na proper workaholic.
0-2102	All these Nopon look alike to me.\nI bet that's really handy for sneaky\nstuff like espionage.
0-2103	But, fighting's on the way out, isn't it?\nWill there really be much point in checking\nout the other colonies?
0-2104	Hey, you haven't seen Pulipuli around,\nhave you? I have something about\nmaintenance I forgot to tell him.
0-2105	Ugh, he was just here a moment ago...\nThat little furball loves to vanish into\nthin air.
0-2106	Can't do nothin' without no ether...
0-2107	You can blame that giant Levnis that\nthe Nopon and the commander are\nso obsessed with building.
0-2108	How long is it going to be until\nwe solve the ether shortage?
0-2109	Well, Yuzet said the shortage would likely\ncontinue for the foreseeable future, so...
0-2110	You're joking... Snuff my life...
0-2111	Meh! Finishing touches on Dorrick\nabout to be applied! Oh-ho!
0-2112	Congrats on a job well done!\nLooking forward to the grand reveal.
0-2113	Mechafriend's looking pretty well tuned.
0-2114	That'll be thanks to Pulipuli's regular\nand careful maintenance.
0-2115	So, that's *really* the paint job they\ndecided to go with then?
0-2116	Yup. They sure weren't joking...
0-2117	Meh-meeeeehhh!!! Now Dorrick\ncompletion imminent, everyone\ngiddy to work Nopon to bone!
0-2119	What's the inspector doing out\nin a place like this late at night?
0-2120	My heart skipped a beat when Ghondor got\ninto that fight earlier... I'm just relieved they\ndecided not to throw her right into solitary.
0-2121	Well, she's the one who effectively keeps the\npeace around here. Lock her up in solitary,\nand you'll have an uprising to pay for it.
0-2122	Crazy to think how Ghondor is the Elder's\ndaughter, what with her abrasive personality.
0-2123	Still, her presence here alone is giving\nus all hope - hope that some help's\ndefinitely going to come our way.
0-2124	Today's prison work has been\na cinch so far, hasn't it?
0-2125	Only 'cause we got worked half to death\nyesterday. Classic carrot and stick tactic,\nthat is, you know.
0-2126	I hope we keep on getting easy\nprison work like we got today.
0-2127	Well, unless you wanna become Feris food\nlike those guys almost did, stay on your toes.\nNo such thing as "easy work" 'round here...
0-2128	Guess it's naive to expect more than\none easy day a year, huh... That warden's\nheart is made of cold, dark steel...
0-2129	That guy's real messed up, he is.\nDoesn't even think of us as human.
0-2130	Gonna be the day of the eclipse pretty\nsoon, right? You've gotta make sure you\ndon't catch the guards' eye...
0-2131	Do anything that stands out to them,\nand nine times out of ten, you'll be\nkissing your head goodbye.
0-2132	Piece of advice, fresh fishies. You'd better\nget an early night's sleep for tomorrow.
0-2133	The Castle Guard are going ahead with\ntheir maneuvers tomorrow as planned.
0-2134	If you've got yourself all set for the escape,\nthen go get some shut-eye right away. Can't\nafford to have daydreamers slowing us down.
0-2135	We're gonna do everything it takes to get you\nOuroboros outta here. We'll sacrifice our own\nlives if that's what it takes.
0-2136	Too right. We'll happily give our\nlives if it helps secure the future of\nour families and the whole City.
0-2137	Them guards don't have a care in the world.
0-2138	But soon enough, they will, mark my words.\nI've been building a hell of a grudge the little\nhappy-go-lucky bastards ain't ready for.
0-2139	All righty! Time for another long,\nfulfilling day of hard prison labor!
0-2140	That whole pretending-things-are-normal act\nain't helping no one, you know? We all know\nthings ain't exactly hunky-dory for us here.
0-2141	It's been five years since they caught me\nwhile I was on a scavenging mission. I'll\nnever live down that day for rest of my life.
0-2142	It's been some eight years or so for me, and\nall that time's dulled my mind. I can't even\nrecall the last time I met my daughter...
0-2143	I took on the bait role in an operation to\ntake back some Agnus growth modules.
0-2144	Doing so got me locked up in here, where I\nnow spend day after day slaving away. Why\nI volunteered to be the bait, I'll never know...
0-2145	I asked the Ouroboros candidates about how\nmy mum and dad are doing. Apparently,\nthey're still alive and kicking.
0-2146	I'm so happy for you. That's gotta put\nsome hope back in you, eh?
0-2147	When it comes to the current\nOuroboros candidates, Jansen's\nreally the only one I heard of.
0-2148	Same for me. After all, his brother was one\nof the finest sons the City's ever had.
0-2149	Those Ouroboros are pretty damn daring to\nbe busting into this prison by themselves.\nReminds me of when Ghondor came here.
0-2150	It wasn't such an event when she came\nhere, was it? But this time...
0-2151	So, the great Guernica has passed on.\nBut apparently, he made some new\nOuroboros before he did...
0-2152	Feels to me like Ghondor's sad he's gone.\nThough don't tell her I said that, or I might\nend up paying a visit to the great man.
0-2153	The Castle Guard have gone off now, right?\nMan, if everything goes to plan, we might\njust be able to get outta here too, huh.
0-2154	That sorta thinking will make a dead man\noutta ya. Our mission here is to get those\nOuroboros outta prison, pure and simple.
0-2155	Those damned Agnians don't even see us\nas people - just machines to be worked and\nworked, until we keel over and die.
0-2156	To them, the only purpose to our entire\nlives is to gather their food and supplies.
0-2157	Say, why's the gangway closed?
0-2158	Agnian raiding party had a pop at us.\nWe're keeping it on lockdown until\nwe can confirm the area's secure.
0-2159	If you want to get to the front gate,\nyou'll need to swing round the right.
0-2160	More orders for the Lost Numbers\nat the Castle. Up for another run?
0-2161	No way, not this time!\nGetting Ghondor to approve them\ntook years off my life last time...
0-2162	We're at about the same altitude as the\nGreat Sword, right...? I hardly ever see\nany birds around... It's really quiet.
0-2163	Yeah, it is... When I was in prison, you could\nhear the waves sometimes. Those were rare\nmoments of comfort...
0-2164	Hey, remember that Collectopaedia Card\nthat bugged out and was illegible? Do you\nknow what happened with that in the end?
0-2165	There weren't any new posts since then, so\nI guess someone went and sorted it out?\n...At least, that's what I'd like to think...
1-0	We'll keep this place covered.\nDon't worry.
1-1	Thanks.\nI appreciate it.
1-2	Thanks for helping us out there.
1-3	You can leave this place to us.
1-4	We've got this place covered.\nYou go on ahead.
1-5	Cheers. I know I can\ncount on you guys.

12-1	Now then... The curtain rises.
12-2	I have always known just how gutless you creatures are...
12-3	I shall observe carefully what you would\nterm your "strength".
12-4	Fleeting beings, what will you show me next?\nCome now, entertain me.
12-5	Hah, very good.\nThe first step in your so-called revolution.
12-6	I see... You would grow strong enough\nto withstand adversity...
12-7	I can hardly believe that your strength has grown thus...
12-8	You would usurp me? Grasp the future?\nI cannot assent. The curtain closes...
12-9	Let the stage of battle scorch your flesh...!
12-10	Let the stage of battle freeze your marrow...!
12-11	I will face you as many times as you want...
12-12	The struggle is all that you are permitted...
12-13	Are your bonds true...? Allow me to assay...
12-14	Behold, the curtain rises once again...\nI hope you'll give us Moebius a good show!
12-15	If you think you can interfere, then you have misassessed me\ngrossly. And yet, you will make not a shred of difference!
12-16	How long will you defy me...? Fine! If it's endless despair\nyou wish for, I will grant it to you gladly!
12-17	You dare defy my will also...?
12-18	Hahahaha!\nRun, run to the ends of the world!
12-19	We've come this far harboring everyone's hopes and dreams!
12-20	And so...!
12-21	We would never stop now, not when we've come so far!
12-22	We won't lose to you!
12-23	We'll fight! For all the people alive!\nTheir desires must build the bridge to the future!
12-24	Who cares about the past?
12-25	We aren't gonna give up...!
12-26	I know what I have to do!
12-27	I work to better myself, so I won't\nmake the same mistakes!
12-28	I'll live for him... For Joran!
12-29	Live...and keep my friends alive! This I swear!
12-30	I'm not gonna imitate others' ways of living any more.
12-31	I'm staying true to who I am,\nand that's the way it's going to be!
12-32	Everyone, lend Ouroboros your power!\nAll is for the future connected!
12-33	Oh no... Noah and the others are trapped...\nI must hurry to their rescue!
12-34	Now is our chance!\nI am sending you reinforcements!
12-35	I have long awaited this moment...\nI too shall join the fight!
12-36	Press the attack, my people!
12-37	Get a load of this!
12-38	Just a bit more! Give it everything!
12-39	Get out of the way! This ends here!
12-40	Let's go an' help 'em, then! We'll grab the future\nwith both hands, this time round!
12-41	This'll take it down...!
12-42	Sorry to keep you waiting!
12-43	Riku add power to mix!
12-44	Manana make open path!
12-45	I pledged myself to you, after all!
12-46	All our hopes are one...\nThey always have been, and they always will be!
12-47	Forget me and you'll pay the price.
12-48	This fight is nothing but an honor...
12-49	Ta-da! Thanks for waiting!
12-50	I won't be defeated... Not here, not now!
12-51	Now, to stamp out this evil at its source!
12-52	Cold of you to leave me behind.
12-53	I'll back you up!
12-54	We were saving the best for later!
12-55	This is it, the real deal, the final punch-up!\nLet's make it one for the ages!
12-56	I'll fight with you!
12-57	Beginning final mission.
12-58	You owe me one, OK?
12-59	This is the last mission!
12-60	Why have you not given up yet...?

2-2	I bet we'll find some more food\nover that way.
2-3	Shall we go and have a look?
2-4	Let's follow these Feris tracks.
2-5	Our Irises should be able\nto track the prints.
2-6	Is this...?
2-7	Could be useful.
2-8	Let's have a little look.
2-9	We should be able to get to\nthose doors from here.
2-10	Look!
2-11	See those huge doors down below?\nLet's see if we can get to them.
2-12	This way.
2-13	I think we can get to the doors from here.
2-18	Not me. It's really unexpected\nfor us too, Ethel.
2-20	It's very reassuring to have you\nwith us, Ethel.
2-21	...
2-22	O-oh... You don't say...
2-23	Right. We'll have to stay\nextra vigilant from now.
2-24	Found anything we could use, Riku?
2-25	Where is he taking us?
2-26	So it's somewhere fairly\nout of the way...
2-27	You have friends in high places...
2-29	Miyabi, try shrugging your shoulders and then let\nthem fall loose. That's helped me in the past.
2-31	"The Has-Been Bean King and the Quest for Peas"...?\nWhat kind of a book is this?
2-32	I understand how you both feel.\nCould you give me some time?
2-33	I didn't realize parks were such\ndangerous places...
2-34	That's Ethel, always trying to better herself.\nMore power to her.
2-35	Um, well... I don't really think\nI can help you there, mate.
2-36	That's right... It's a place to honor the dead,\nand to look deep inside yourself.
2-37	Monica, can I ask you something?
2-38	Jansen! Everyone...!
2-39	We owe her so much, I don't think\nwe could ever repay her.
2-40	Um, shall we take a quick break?
2-41	Monica, should we play for them too?
2-42	Yeah... Feels like it was only yesterday.
2-43	Hm... D'you get the feeling we're\nbeing watched?
2-44	Right.
2-45	Both places have their merits.\nI like Colony 9 too, of course.
2-46	Oh, I would never do that.\nI'd hate to make an enemy of you.
2-47	You're really getting into this...
2-48	Hahaha... But the people here live longer still.
2-49	All we can do now is to give him the freedom\nto lead the best life he possibly can.
2-50	Far removed from the horrors of war...\nThey're taking good care of them.
2-51	Alex, are you OK?\nYou're not looking too well.
2-52	Looks like it. Let's get back to the storehouse\nand tell Chelle the good news.
2-53	Quick, to Yunnae's Rise!
2-54	Sorry I upset you... But I'm glad\nyou're feeling better now.
2-55	A Kevesi container?\nWhat would it be doing here?
2-56	Sorry, Melia. I had no idea they'd\nbe making such a fuss over this...
2-57	What was that...?
2-58	That's all Zeon's work.\nThe whole thing was quite an ordeal...
2-59	I think so too. Good luck getting\nthem to admit that...
2-60	Don't worry. I know a genuine smile\nwhen I see one.
2-61	Yeah. Act like we're in real combat!
2-62	Hey, so what's this "good place"\nyou were talking about?
2-63	Teach...?
2-64	I knew you'd say that...
2-65	We should start by checking on\nZoren and the others.
2-67	I hope there's some clue in Colony 4\nabout where to find No. 13...
2-68	What in the world has that thing\nbeen stealing?
2-69	Roger!
2-70	It's looking more cushy than your\naverage colony now.
2-71	Right. Let's pop it on his Collectopaedia Card.
2-72	All done.
2-73	What's gotten into you?
2-74	He looks worried.\nLet's ask him what's wrong.
2-75	Colony Sigma were fighting frantically\nfor their lives, just like us...
2-76	Just...don't get in over your head,\nOK, Lanz?
2-77	Are we the last ones here?\nSorry I made you wait...
2-78	There's Colony 9.
2-79	Time to head out soon?
2-80	This should put us about\nhalfway, then.
2-81	It's our Colony 9 gang.\nLet's take a break over there.
2-82	Our priority is to take down our target. I think\nwe should avoid confrontation with Agnus.
2-83	I know... But if we can only get to\nthe base of that pillar of light...
2-84	I'm fine. I just... I'm not sure how\nto feel, that's all.
2-85	Is there anything we could use...?
2-86	Should be. Let's have a little look.
2-87	Mm. Let's check out a container.
2-88	Hey, this is still new to us.\nDon't rush in!
2-89	Mio? Are you all right?
2-90	I bet you can hardly wait.
2-91	Why was Ethel behaving like that?
2-92	It might... But we have to press on.\nWe have to...
2-93	It's a problem. Seems they're\nalready racking up patients...
2-95	I guess we should just head to\nElsie's Spout then. Taion?
2-96	I guess the Consul hasn't interfered\nwith his Iris. Not sure why, though...
2-97	All right, we need to get back to\nthe cliffs, where we met Valdi...
2-98	We need to make some distance.
2-100	Don't let Riku hear that. You'll make\nhim even moodier than he already is.
2-101	Doesn't look like they can\nfollow us this far with their gear.
2-102	Seems so. Let's stay alert.
2-103	Right. We'll continue west for a bit\nand then get out of the Great Falls.
2-104	Yeah, I know.\nBut I can't just turn a blind eye.
2-105	Yeah. It feels like it's completely\ncut off from the outside world...
2-106	Keves and Agnus are both fully mobilized.\nWe'll have to pick them off one at a time.
2-107	We haven't bumped into them yet. Maybe their\nnest's even higher up than we thought.
2-108	For Ethel's sake, we have to take\ncare of the Annihilator, and quickly.
2-109	Oh, believe me, we will.
2-110	This'll lead us round to the\nback of the Castle.
2-111	The transport containers\nshouldn't be far now.
2-112	We can't go back the way we came.\nWe'll have to find another way out.
2-114	There's a fort up ahead, and security's\ntight. We don't want to get too close.
2-115	Are there really so many people...? This is\nbeyond anything we could have imagined...
2-116	Now I know how you guys felt\nin Colony 4...
2-117	I think that would be asking a bit too-\nHmm. Actually...
2-118	Perhaps it's to do with what Timna was\nsaying about the City's rival factions...
2-119	We should be done with the ether cylinders\nnow. Let's get back to Mr. Samon.
2-120	Back to the City barracks, then?
2-121	Come on, let's hop on the Boundary.
2-122	We'll sneak around the island and head for the opposite side.\nThat'll be where Agnians keep the transport.
2-123	The security's tight. It'd be a bad\nidea to approach from the front...
2-124	Looks like it's all downhill from here.\nWe can slide down the ropes to get inside.
2-125	The mission proceeds as planned. Look for\ninfo that might relate to the prison camp.
2-126	We'll have to find somewhere\nwhere the walls look thin.
2-127	Well, how about we inquire about\nour new digs along the way?
2-128	We have to make sure we don't\nblow our cover while in combat.
2-129	It has to. We'll do everything\nwe can to make it work.
2-130	All right, so now we deal with the\nsentries, as planned.
2-131	Right. It should be back along the\nroute we took yesterday.
2-132	Mio, your hair...
2-133	I think you should do whatever\nmakes you happy, Mio.
2-134	I guess we'll be heading out\nonce everyone's ready.
2-135	Beyond here is the Aetia region.\nThen it's onwards to the Cloudkeep!
2-136	It looks a lot more inhospitable\nthan I'd imagined...
2-137	This is the west route, right?\nAnd you say we'll find Colony Omega here?
2-138	Yeah, Travis arranged to have us\npicked up at the entrance.
2-139	Me too.\nIt's a huge weight off my mind.
2-140	The Origin metal signal was\ncoming from around here, right?
2-141	All right. Where to start...?
2-142	Yeah, I don't know what we'd\nhave done without Mr. Samon.
2-143	Is everyone all right?!
2-144	What a view...
2-145	Yeah. I'll be depending on you,\nLanz, right to the very end.
2-146	Everyone's lending us their strength.\nIt's all riding on us.
2-147	Yeah. Time to change the world.
2-148	I wonder... How about we stop by\nthe Castle and pay her a visit?
2-150	Yeah... I guess we should tell\nBolearis about it personally.
2-154	I think we've done the rounds here.\nLet's head back to the Castle.
2-155	I don't know... But we'll need to\nproceed with extreme caution.
2-156	I'm fine. We need to go up to the\nthrone room. Crys is waiting...
2-157	Hmm.\nI don't suppose they'll let us past.
2-158	We can stay undetected this way.
2-159	These dust clouds are awful...
2-160	Let's just hurry. It's too soon\nto assume the worst.
2-161	Sorry, but the war room should\nbe our top priority right now.
2-163	I think that's all of them.
2-164	All right, time to head back.
2-168	All right, what's next?
2-171	A little elbow grease, huh...\nI think I get how Valdi feels.
2-172	It could be risky to work on it here. How\nabout that place we were at earlier?
2-173	The Ansels were sighted a bit\nfurther up, right?
2-174	We're done with the levnite issue too.\nBack to Colony 30, then?
2-175	I hear Pulipuli's helping with the construction now.\nHope he's keeping his nose to the grindstone.
2-176	They're low on ether because of the work on\nDorrick? That's such a Valdi thing to happen...
2-179	Maybe we'll find Mr. Samon\nover at maintenance?
2-180	No... They were raised and nurtured\nby the people here.
2-182	We should gain access to the elevator\nplatform if we operate the controls.
2-183	The maintenance hatch should be\non the far side of this area.
2-184	I think so. It should take us to the\nchannel's upper level.
2-186	Won't be a second.
2-188	Everyone, over here.
2-189	If we pool our strength, we should\nbe able to manage somehow.
2-192	Hm? Is that...?
2-193	Huh, how are we supposed to get there...?
2-195	Hey, isn't that Dorin and Bambam?
2-196	You'll do just fine, Juniper. Let's go.
2-197	That's true. If anyone gets hurt in the process,\nit'll be defeating the purpose...
2-198	Nothing we can do but look, for now.
2-199	Moving troops through mountains or woodland\ntends to be strenuous. Let's take every precaution.
2-200	Let's just hurry back!
2-201	Agnian Levnises in a Kevesi Colony...\nOnly recently, it would've been unthinkable.
2-202	There must be a key somewhere.\nLet's find it.
2-203	Huh? What in the world is this device for?
2-204	We won't be climbing this any time soon.
2-205	I think there's more food\nto find over there.
2-206	Well? Let's go find it!
2-207	Let's follow the Feris tracks.
2-208	If we use our Irises, we should\nbe able to pick up the trail.
2-209	What's this now...?
2-210	Yeah, let's definitely grab it.
2-211	Hey, is that...?
2-212	That hatch should lead to a channel.
2-213	Over there...!
2-214	Say, let's start by heading for\nthose doors down below.
2-215	This is some story!
2-216	We've picked up some tidbits.
2-217	That should be enough data.
2-219	Ethel...
2-220	Absolutely... Let's be sure to\ncome back out alive.
2-221	Let's find something spectacular!
2-222	So there's a "spa" here...?
2-223	I think we'd be better off asking\nthe folk at the canteen, no?
2-224	I have to say, I'm getting\na little psyched for this!
2-226	Isn't it funny? Our being together here\nlike this, it's partly thanks to this thing.
2-227	Ah, Miyabi, hold on... We really\nshouldn't be talking about that here...
2-228	I'd like to watch it with you, if that's OK.
2-229	I think that's probably the\nleast of their issues...
2-230	It may be best that you don't,\nCammuravi...
2-231	They can make you sad, or joyful... The sound alone\ncan stir your soul. Do you want to try one for yourself?
2-232	Tell me, Cammuravi, what have\nyou been up to, here in the City?
2-233	How has Ethel been, lately?\nHas she settled down a little?
2-234	Yeah... I think I know what you mean.\nI feel the same, actually.
2-235	...All right.
2-236	This place was made to work the inmates hard,\nbut I think Ghondor made it out pretty unscathed.
2-237	I'm glad the ceremony didn't have to be postponed.
2-238	(...Hm? Who's she saying that to...?)
2-239	Hey Nia, is there anything\nin particular you'd like to eat?
2-240	Yes! Fight by our side, Nia,\nand let's make it a reality.
2-241	(I can tell I'm being watched...\nHe must be very wary of me.)
2-242	That's exactly why we should save\nall the lives that we possibly can...
2-243	Let's just try talking to him.
2-244	Incredible... Your eyes\nare literally shining...!
2-245	Seems like we'll have to\nloop around from the right!
2-246	Alexandria, this "something interesting"...\nWhat's this about, exactly?
2-247	...We'll happily take you wherever\nyou want, just say the word.
2-248	It's a tool of punishment...\nA fearsome one at that.
2-249	Let's hurry.
2-250	There doesn't seem to be\nanyone around...
2-251	I'm glad we managed to\ndeliver the pendant.
2-252	...Of course. I'd planned on it.
2-253	Now then, Teach.\nYou said you wanted to talk...?
2-254	I hope Kyrie's all right...
2-255	Kyrie... Please be OK...!
2-256	...Let's check back on things later.
2-257	How far does this thing go...?
2-258	You'd never believe this used to be\na prison camp, if you didn't know...
2-259	Thanks, I'm OK.\nBit weirded out, but fine.
2-260	What a gorgeous view...
2-261	It'll be a long journey before\nwe reach the Great Sword...
2-262	That Ferronis must've been there\nfor quite some time.
2-263	Let's collect it for later.
2-264	Egh, I'm starting to sweat already...
2-265	It's sweltering...
2-266	I just got a glimpse of hope.\nGuess I can hold on a while longer...
2-267	Must be thanks to Manana's cooking.\nI always knew it was something special!
2-268	I'm doing fine today, thanks.\nA far cry better than yesterday, anyway...
2-269	We're very nearly out of\nEagus Wilderness now, aren't we?
2-270	We should retreat under cover, then.
2-271	Finally safe from the shelling, huh...
2-272	Let's try to put it\nout of our minds, Sena.
2-273	Yeah... If this carries on, the wounded will\njust keep piling up higher and higher...
2-275	I really hope we find some\nmedical supplies...
2-276	Thank the flame, I'll finally be free\nof this Eagus Wilderness...!
2-277	Hang on, is this the right way?
2-278	Elsie's Spout is just a hop,\nskip and a jump away!
2-279	I'm with you. Shall we try climbing\na bit higher up the mountain?
2-280	Better watch our heads\nas we fight the monsters.
2-281	I was as shocked as you were...
2-282	No time to worry about that now!\nWe need to make for the water veins.
2-283	Gas grenades...? That's hardly fair...!
2-284	The Colony Lambda residential area...\nD'you think it's behind the waterfall?
2-285	I hope everyone's safe...
2-289	We'll have to climb up here\nto exit the Great Falls area.
2-290	Yeah... It's quite unlike\nany other colony...
2-291	There wasn't any food here, was there?
2-292	This amount should keep us going for a while!
2-293	So, those Tirkins that took our food...\nWhere could they have got to?
2-294	Have to be extra careful\nnot to fall from here...
2-295	I'm sorry I worried you.\nI'll be OK now.
2-296	You think we'll make it?\nI just hope nobody spots us...
2-297	Security's gotten tighter...\nStay vigilant.
2-298	You said it... This journey has certainly\ntaken us to some incredible places...
2-299	Finally...
2-300	Keves Castle has got nothing\non this dizzying height...
2-301	It's bigger than half a dozen colonies...
2-302	Right? At least they warmed up to us eventually.\nMaybe it'll be the same here...
2-303	Nope... She didn't so much as\nmake my ears twitch...
2-304	Yeah... Quite a weight to carry,\nabsorbing all this in one go.
2-305	We saw those signs of battles against Agnus and\nKeves yesterday, right? Let's go there first.
2-306	I think we can take that elevator down\nto the war room.
2-307	The place Timna lives... It's so different\nfrom where they've got us staying...
2-308	The material storage warehouse is outside the City,\nright? Why didn't they put it closer by, do you think?
2-309	Nothing to do till tomorrow morning\nbut kick back and charge our batteries.
2-310	Hey Taion, you doing all right there?
2-313	All right, we made it to Erythia Relay Base\nin one piece. What now?
2-314	Just as we'd heard, it's unlikely\nwe'll be discovered here.
2-315	We've made it inside.
2-316	Was it just me, or did the guard\nback there say "first"...?
2-317	Everyone's doing the same work, but\nthey're still happy to share with strangers...
2-318	To think this is how they keep the colonies fed...\nI honestly don't know how to feel.
2-319	Taion, are you feeling unwell? Should we head\nback to the cell and let you rest up for a bit?
2-320	I know exactly how you feel. Still, for the good\nof the plan...let's hold our peace for now, eh?
2-321	Let's go report back.
2-322	Yeah! We've got to make this plan\na success, or else!
2-323	Out of anyone, I would *hate* to\nmake an enemy of Ghondor...
2-324	You're used to it like this, right?
2-325	Why don't you cut your hair too, Eunie?\nIt's a lot more manageable.
2-326	My hair's so long now...\nMaybe I really should've cut it...?
2-327	Thanks! I thought it'd feel strange,\nat first, but it's actually quite OK.
2-328	Yeah. The colony I was at with\nMiyabi...
2-329	Miyabi...
2-330	Yes... Thanks so much, everyone!\nNext stop - the Cloudkeep!
2-331	I think we're about\nhalfway to the summit.
2-332	Not long now.\nHang in there.
2-333	Watch your step - it's a long way down.
2-334	I'm just glad the people in the City\nmade it through unscathed...
2-335	Umm, so where's the place\nMr. Samon told us about...?
2-336	I didn't expect we'd be going back\nto meet the Queen again so soon.
2-337	Let's sniff it out.
2-338	We'll find it. I daresay we're becoming\nold hands at this...
2-339	There were also a few Tirkin feathers\nwhere the Origin metal was buried.
2-340	A ship that can traverse even the Great Sea's\nvortex...? Phew, technology sure is a marvel!
2-341	Too true, Sena... Just a few months\nago, it'd have been unimaginable...
2-342	We'll just have to live up to\ntheir expectations then.
2-343	Noah. The time has come.
2-344	Let's proceed carefully.
2-345	I do wonder... Shall we pop by and\nenquire after Her Majesty's mood?
2-346	Sure. It's on my mind as well.
2-347	It's actually raining...
2-349	Say, about this thing with Ethel...
2-354	It doesn't look like Dana and the others'\nship has arrived yet...
2-355	The silence is unnerving...
2-356	Noah, are you all right?
2-357	Mmm, this is still bearable, for me...\nI guess you hate the cold, Eunie?
2-358	Yeah... It should come into view\nany minute now.
2-359	There's only one way to Omega,\nand it's through them...
2-360	Let's aim for the Flame Clock.\nWe're sure to learn something there...
2-361	It breaks my heart to see\nthe City in this state...
2-362	It's right down this way. Hurry!
2-363	We have to let them know about this.
2-364	Let's sort this mess out.
2-365	The camp's a stone's throw\nfrom the Great Sword...
2-366	Let's try not to get ahead of ourselves.
2-368	We've got what we needed.
2-375	Oh, is this the island with\nthe spectacular waterfall?
2-376	Are the folks of Colony 15 all right?\nI really hope so...
2-377	Poor Jaggar...
2-378	Huh...? That noise...!\nI think there's a Levnis nearby!
2-379	Hahah... Well then, let's not keep him\nwaiting. Back to Colony 30!
2-380	We always knew it'd be a big job. Let's\njust keep plugging away at it, shall we?
2-381	None of us are Levnis whizzes like Valdi. The best we\ncan do is keep encouraging him, just like we have been.
2-382	That would mean the mechanics, the Commissary,\nand anyone who's good friends with the Nopon.
2-383	Doesn't it make you a bit jealous? He pours\nso much of himself into doing what he loves...
2-387	Who are we asking, then?
2-388	Well this certainly opened up...
2-389	Over there...! We should be able to move ahead.
2-390	It seems locked...
2-391	Me neither! ...I just wish I knew what was what,\nso I wouldn't feel so useless...
2-392	It doesn't seem like we'll find anything\nhere. We might have to go deeper...
2-396	Say, over there...
2-397	If we slid along that...
2-398	Hey, is that...?
2-399	A cave! ...Should we go in?
2-400	That container...
2-401	Mmm... Doesn't look like we can go through here...
2-402	What's that device...?
2-403	Looks like it's still usable.\nWho wants to do the honors?
2-404	Look over there!
2-405	Anybody else feeling curious?
2-406	It's the Levnis that Ymeer fixed up.\nLooks like it's working and everything!
2-407	Dorin... And Bambam, too?
2-408	Yeah... For sure.
2-410	I dunno about that...
2-411	All right then, tell me what you'd recommend.
2-413	What's this? Maybe some kind of\nconstruction corps left it behind...?
2-414	No, there's no way we can climb that.
2-417	Ooh, found something good here!
2-418	Hehehe, what do you reckon?
2-419	Hey, is that...?
2-420	Might be an idea to head for\nthose doors down there?
2-421	I see.
2-422	So this gets us to the passage\nabove, eh?
2-423	I see, I see.
2-424	Hmmm.
2-427	Roger dodger. Let's go pick it up\nbefore someone else does.
2-428	That really spooked me back then...
2-430	Like I keep asking, how's this different\nfrom a bath exactly?
2-431	That's just what I was gonna say!
2-432	OK, do we wanna go through\nit all then?
2-433	Probably only thinking about how\ngood one would taste...
2-434	Hey, you all right? Did you swallow\nsome sand?
2-435	Haha, feels weird when you put it like that...
2-436	If I was born here, would I get all\nwrinkly someday?
2-437	Ah, right. Well, I mean...\nit sorta makes sense?
2-438	So, how's life in the big City?\nYou used to it yet?
2-439	Um. My head kind of hurts...
2-440	So, uh, Garrett must be from one of\nthem Six Houses too, right?
2-441	Yeah... We want them to be able to live\nhow they want, once they've woken up.
2-442	Totally different from the City, right?\nIt's actually a nifty little corner of the world.
2-443	So does the City have fields and crops\nand stuff too?
2-444	You've come all this way, it'd be a\nshame not to go say hi to our Majesty.
2-445	I can't wait to see the look on\nGhondor's face when she sees you...
2-446	Food shortages...\nSounds pretty grim.
2-447	Found him! It's Fox!
2-448	How many's that now?! You've just\neaten, you greedy git!
2-449	Colony 9's my place.\nMakes me feel so calm.
2-450	Guess they've never seen folks with wings before.\nThey're the weird ones, just stare back.
2-452	Hehe, mind you don't get lost!
2-453	Sparks, that guy pisses me off...!
2-454	(sigh) Now we just gotta report\nto Sequoia and we're done.
2-455	A lot's happened since then...\nAnd still, they've done right by us.
2-456	Idiosyncrasies? More like they're plain idiots.
2-457	Really? That's...slightly uncomfortable...
2-458	That was a close call...
2-459	Ahh, this is strictly first-termer\nlevel stuff for us!
2-460	Hey, Teach... Are these lessons of\nyours really that tough?
2-461	Still just a bunch of crazies, though.
2-462	Says the woman who leaps into\nthe thick of it by herself.
2-463	You're talking about your own colony...
2-464	Was she gonna say "suicide attack"?!
2-465	Disappear on us again and I'll\nthrash the life out of you.
2-466	You're joking...
2-467	A challenge from those three?\nI've got a bad feeling about this...
2-468	This time it's deserters... As if this\ncolony didn't have enough problems!
2-469	So what's this guard captain got to do\nwith Zoren?
2-470	Hey, don't play any of your usual tricks\njust 'cause they're Agnus!
2-471	Can't believe we're back here...
2-472	Yep, let's take 'em all out!
2-473	Yeah, you don't wanna break down just\nbecause you couldn't keep things in good nick.
2-474	Yeah, nothing better than\nunburdening yourself.
2-475	There's a lot of ground between us and\nAlfeto Valley...
2-476	This isn't the way to Alfeto Valley.\nC'mon, let's get the spark out of here.
2-477	And we only just won the fight with\nColony Sigma...
2-478	They're tough... And here I thought\nour colony had the higher rank...
2-479	Ah, it's fine. We're used to it.
2-480	Uh, no? It's no substitute for a proper bath.
2-481	Finally I can soak my worries away!
2-482	Lanz, you're being very...diligent.
2-483	I think Noah knows that, Lanz.
2-484	Then let's snap 'em up.
2-485	Better not leave your valuables! We ain't\ncoming back once the operation's started.
2-486	Yep. Gotta get ready for the operation.
2-487	Does it matter? All we gotta do is\nfollow orders and it'll work out.
2-488	There are still monsters about,\nis that what you mean? I know.
2-489	Are you all right, Noah?
2-490	We'll be out of the valley soon.
2-491	Well. This is kind of...awkward.
2-492	Think there's gonna be anything\nleft that we can use?
2-493	If we get the Ferronis running, that's\nnot gonna switch on the defenses, is it?
2-494	Let's have a look in the next container.
2-495	Yeah. We've gotta use every means\nat our disposal.
2-496	Bit of a scorcher, innit?
2-497	Just let me dive in...
2-498	Riku saw the Aspar around here, right?
2-499	Guess now we've left the army, we\ngotta handle stuff like this ourselves.
2-500	Noah! Let's just clear out for now!\nWe can think about the why later!
2-501	Erm... If we've got black fog, does that\nmean that annihilation thingy...?
2-502	Queen's wings, finally!
2-503	Where are we staying again?
2-504	After the day they had yesterday?\nI knew Ethel's lot were sturdy, but...
2-506	OK, all the little jobs are done.\nTime to hit the baths?
2-507	Yep. We got places we need to be.
2-508	Yeah, up a cliff. I mean, Lanz and Sena\ncan climb this, but me? Hard pass.
2-509	Ugh...that's me done...
2-510	Nope! Nope! Not listening!\nCan't hear a thing!
2-511	That room's kinda suspicious, eh?
2-512	You know, I'm surprised - Riku and\nManana make a good pair.
2-513	Seriously. Who'd have thought\nthey had anything like that?
2-514	Oh, you know! Noah said he was\ngoing to do his thing, so...
2-515	Pfft, maybe you and Sena could.
2-516	From here we go...west, right?
2-517	Nimble little so-and-sos, sliding\ndown here on a rope.
2-518	Woohoo! This gets the blood\npumpin', eh?
2-519	Anlood meat is\nsparking amazing!
2-520	Wanna look a bit further back?
2-521	We couldn't even if we wanted to!
2-522	We've rounded up plenty of\ningredients. Looks tasty!
2-523	Ugh, I just wanna leg it across\nand finish this!
2-524	Uugh! Another place high up...
2-525	Nice landing!
2-526	There's plenty of black fog. How come\nthe annihilation thing ain't happening?
2-527	Phew... I'm starting to think\nwe might actually make it.
2-528	Do you think this City thing's really real?
2-529	You're telling me. Just looking down\nmakes me feel faint...
2-530	Man... I think I need some time\nto process all this.
2-531	Do you really think she can come up\nwith three hundred ether cylinders?
2-532	They must have wanted it somewhere that's\nhard to reach. Not that info didn't leak anyway.
2-533	Hey, looks like everyone else\nis here already.
2-534	Ah! I can see the Balaena!
2-535	Cool, we can get in without anyone\nthe wiser.
2-536	Keep your voice down, you blitherin'\nidiot!
2-537	Guess it had to happen eventually.
2-538	Queen's heels, am I sick of all this gathering!
2-539	Ugh, are we finally finished?!\nLet's get this report done!
2-540	Snuff those guards, treating us like\ndirt! Who do they think we are?!
2-541	It's more brutal than I thought.
2-542	Your snoring could have fooled me!
2-543	Do we seriously have to keep doing this?\nWe're just about ready to blow this joint.
2-544	Yes, ma'am! Taking care of dumb jobs\nis just what us model prisoners do!
2-545	Yup. We can help with the cleanup.
2-546	It's not much of a living space, but at least\nit's safe. Let's just take a load off, love.
2-547	Nah, I'm all right, love. If it gets as\nlong as Noah's then I'll think about it.
2-548	We used to look up at this place\nfrom Colony 9...
2-549	Mio, are we there yet?
2-550	Maaan, get a load of this place...\nDo you think the Queen's really here?
2-551	What's the matter, Taion? Not getting\nall nervous are you?
2-552	Back to the City for a bit, then?
2-553	Is this where the readout for the\nOrigin metal's coming from?
2-554	So Tirkins buried it? Crafty little gits...
2-555	I'm full of beans thanks to somebody's\npiloting skills!
2-556	I'm fine, innit. You haven't chipped a\nnail or anything, have you?
2-557	Hey... Don't you think there's\nsomething...off about this place?
2-558	I wonder what Her Majesty our Queen's\ngetting up to, right about now.
2-562	...What's happening?
2-563	Something weird's going on...right?
2-564	Crys...
2-565	Brrrrr... I'm freezin'.\nMio, aren't you cold?
2-566	Sooo, Taion... Feeling the pressure yet?
2-567	I don't think Taion's mind's on the job.
2-568	Oh dear. Better leave him be for a spell.
2-569	We can confirm them by Iris later.
2-570	Queen's oath, that thing looked knackered.\nHope it doesn't just stop there.
2-571	Nearly at the rendezvous.\nHope we've not kept him waiting.
2-572	Looks that way. Defenses look\na bit tighter than at Lambda.
2-573	Yeah. Sparks, but I've got a bad\nfeeling about this...
2-574	Erm. These weren't here before,\nwere they?
2-575	Tsk, nothing good's gonna come of\nthis. We'd better prepare for the worst.
2-576	If it's all like this then this'll be\na cakewalk!
2-579	Right then. Time to head back.
2-585	You're a bit too enthusiastic about this.\nDidn't that one come from your place?
2-586	You reckon? You sure he doesn't\njust have Levnises on the brain?
2-587	You look pretty pleased, Taion!\n...Make us a cuppa then.
2-588	Let's go to Solon in the supply team.
2-589	When the spark did Colony 30\nget this many Nopon...?
2-590	Well, if you wanna help your little friend out,\nhow about introducing him to a mechanic, eh?
2-591	So both Dinkidinki and Widgewidge were the\nculprits? Erm...which Nopon were they again?
2-595	Knowing Valdi, he'll find a way to\nget up to some other mischief.
2-596	Now you said that, I realized all we ever talk\nabout with Zeon these days is bloody potatoes...
2-597	Yeah, uh, good luck with that.
2-599	Is it really here?
2-600	Wonder how things are in the fields?
2-601	Back here again...\nThe place where Guernica saved us.
2-602	Don't tell me we're crossing here...?
2-603	Gotta be able to unlock it somewhere.
2-604	Do we get on this lift?
2-605	We won't get much further this way...
2-606	That's why Rikus were invented, innit?
2-610	A container!
2-611	Finders keepers!
2-612	Hey now, what's that...?
2-613	I think we could slide down that thing!
2-616	Hrmm?
2-617	Well, shoot. How're we supposed to get there?
2-620	Just act confident, and we'll be golden.\nTry not to fidget, yeah?
2-621	Remember when we were walkin' through the woods,\nand Juniper shot at me? Good times, good times...
2-623	You gotta give the soldiers here some encouragement.
2-624	Innit... Not to condone deserting, but if I had to\nwork for Knoquehardt, you bet I'd at least consider it.
2-625	Seems we need the key.\nWhat a faff...
2-626	Well, on we go then.
2-629	Shouldn't we search a little farther in?
2-630	We should gather some more ingredients.\nYou can never be too careful.
2-631	This is...?
2-632	I'll be using this.
2-633	That sticks in the mind.
2-634	I see a huge doorway below.\nLet's make our way to that for now.
2-635	This way.
2-636	We can get to where those doors are this way.
2-637	Interesting.
2-638	Ah, so that's what it was.
2-641	Right. He must be worried about you.
2-642	Yes, sir!
2-643	Let's go, Commander.
2-644	Yes, sir... This place, it's...inimitable.
2-645	Let's press on, sir.
2-646	After I left your side, Commander, I had the\nhonor of working on many missions here.
2-647	It's all thanks to what you\ntaught me, sir.
2-648	What about the Nopon?
2-650	It's very impressive...\nA monument to life.
2-651	Well this certainly took an\nunexpected turn.
2-652	Perhaps we should pay a visit to the lab?\nThere might still be something hidden there.
2-653	There are times when people want to be alone...\nMaybe it was the same with her.
2-654	What a brilliant contraption!\nNo wonder nobody's ever found it.
2-655	This is the most self-sufficient colony I've seen in\nterms of food supply. Not that it could beat the City.
2-656	We'll keep that in mind. You're very\nknowledgeable about this place.
2-657	Somebody fetch some water here, stat!
2-658	Your Majesty, we should spread the\nnews of your return!
2-659	Indeed, that's definitely where the\nproblem lies.
2-660	I'm all for preparing for an emergency,\nbut taking from others is not the way.
2-661	Must...keep...composure...
2-662	Absolutely. I'd love to run\na survey on this place.
2-663	Zeon... Those are flowers, not weeds.
2-664	This is a very special environment...\nLots of endemic life to be found.
2-665	These are some unusual\nterrain formations...
2-666	All right. We can discuss this on our\nnext break over some herbal tea.
2-667	The grudge seems pretty deep-seated...
2-668	Don't worry too much about it.\nThis is Valdi we're talking about.
2-669	It's mostly aligned with yours.\nThere's something else going on here.
2-670	I see. It's well protected, all the way down here.
2-671	Alexandria... You're talking out loud.
2-672	It's hard to imagine them developing\na weapon, but who knows...
2-673	Hmm.
2-674	What conversation are you expecting?
2-675	So even Agnus's elite haven't been\nable to penetrate this fastness...
2-676	I hope this can be of some use to you.
2-677	Is that Triton...?\nYes, it must be...
2-678	There should be three in all, right?\nLet's hurry.
2-679	All the hard work was worth it to\nhear you say that, Commander.
2-680	Alexandria's methods have their pros\nand cons, but I agree she gets results.
2-682	...Whereas you're the model of restraint.
2-683	Ashera, please at least pretend\nyou can act rational.
2-684	Seems lively.
2-685	A sensible decision. A Ferron\ncan't run without fuel, after all.
2-686	There's no going back to Colony Gamma!\nWe need to get some distance or they'll find us!
2-687	Sena, why waste your time worrying about\nthose Kevesi fools? Forget about them.
2-688	We need to cut through that cave if\nwe're going to head south.
2-689	How do you think we feel?
2-690	It was probably abandoned after being\nput out of commission decades ago.
2-691	Ether's gushing out. This is an ether\nchannel, no doubt about it.
2-692	I can confirm that they were damaged\nbeyond repair. We'll be fine.
2-693	Let's install an ether cylinder in the power\ncompartment and get the Ferronis moving.
2-694	This Ouroboros power... We need to\nlearn how to use it most effectively.
2-695	Indeed. But we already agreed with\nMio. Let's go back to the east route.
2-696	We should take it out quickly\nand obtain the materials.
2-697	Mio, are you dealing better with\nthe heat?
2-698	I can't tell where this leads, but\nall we can do is keep moving forward.
2-699	People in Colony 4 are certainly\nquick to accept things...
2-700	I don't think the med team are\nable to respond in time...
2-701	Galghour's Menhir is north of here.
2-702	Right. There are a lot of resources on the way,\nbut I'd ask that we keep detours to a minimum.
2-703	Do you remember? This is the exit to the short\nroute from the Fornis region, the one I suggested.
2-704	I noticed something... Valdi didn't look at\nus and call us "monsters" or anything.
2-705	We can make sure we're in perfect shape by replenishing\nsupplies at Colony 30. We've got the time.
2-706	But the view is spectacular...
2-707	We'll be easily spotted this way.\nThe side path further back is our best bet.
2-708	Next time I'll make some for you too.\nFor now, let's stick a pin in the topic.
2-709	We can but hope.
2-710	We might be able to go in\nfrom the other side.
2-711	They read us like an open book... How?!
2-712	We're almost at the water veins!
2-713	I wonder what's happening in there...
2-714	Where's Commander Isurd...?
2-715	What are you going to do outside?
2-716	Are we going back to where\nwe fought with Lambda?
2-717	We should be able to, but since we're going to the\nGreat Cotte Falls, we won't need to at this time.
2-718	I hear it's tough going inside.\nWe'd best be on the lookout.
2-719	No, we have to go up to get to Keves Castle.\nWe should turn back before it gets dangerous.
2-720	Make it through here and we'll be\nin sight of the Castle.
2-721	I couldn't begin to guess...but I'd say\nthe Castle has something to do with it.
2-722	This would explain how Keves is able\nto deploy so many Levnises.
2-724	But smash that auto-balancer\nand the whole thing comes down.
2-725	Yeah. Jump in this channel and\nwe'll pop out in the lake outside.
2-726	Up ahead is the Cadensia region. We'll be at\nthe base of the Great Sword before too long.
2-727	I can hardly believe it...\nBut it was Ethel, without a doubt.
2-728	According to Mr. Samon, Timna's place\nshould be around here.
2-729	I daresay being in one of those Six Houses sets\none apart from most of the City residents, too.
2-730	I'm a little worn out...but you don't\nneed to worry about me.
2-731	Acting alone is better for intelligence gathering, and makes\nit easier to hide. It may have been a strategic decision.
2-732	Let's try to sneak in quietly. We don't\nwant to be found by the Agnians.
2-733	Well, it is an enemy military facility... Maybe we\nreally should have looked for a better route.
2-734	Look, it connects to the rear of\nthe base.
2-735	We should access it and see what\nkind of intel we can pull.
2-736	Let's take the opportunity to rest,\nthen proceed with the infiltration.
2-737	I can't tell from the data we've pulled.\nWe'll have to check each route systematically.
2-738	There might be more to this job than we\nbargained for... I think we're in for a rough day...
2-739	Let's hope we can get them out\nwithout a hitch.
2-740	I think I had enough back-breaking\nlabor to last me for a term or two...
2-741	If we do this, we're exempt from the\nother jobs. I think this is our best bet.
2-742	How could they let this thing loose...?\nWhose sick idea was this?
2-743	We go out of here and then\nto the left. Move.
2-744	I'm not exactly fond of it either, but we can't\nafford to make the guards suspicious.
2-746	Let's return to the Castle.
2-747	This is the shortest route to the\nCloudkeep.
2-748	Mio...I'm glad we were able to save you.
2-749	So this is the Cloudkeep.\nIt's certainly lavish...
2-750	I am feeling kind of tense...
2-751	What, I'm meeting Her Majesty the Queen!\nWho wouldn't be nervous right now?!
2-752	First we go into the control room,\napparently.
2-753	We have to be on our best behavior!
2-754	The Origin metal signal was coming\nfrom around here.
2-755	Let's leave no stone unturned.
2-756	We need to hand these\nstraight over to Mr. Samon.
2-757	Who knew this hulking great thing\nwould be under the central sea?
2-758	Ferronises... Were they created\ninside Origin?
2-759	They'll be just fine. We need to focus\non what we have to do.
2-760	This fight isn't ending any time soon...\nEunie, are you feeling all right?
2-761	Our Ouroboros powers...\nThey're being suppressed?
2-762	Let's go. Stay vigilant.
2-763	It might be dicey trying to run through\nas we are now...
2-764	I wonder how Her Majesty is doing...
2-770	They might have run into trouble after they left port...\nIt might be an idea to follow their route back.
2-771	How surprising, an ambush.
2-772	You want us to wipe all these out?
2-773	The Levnis has stopped too...\nIs it because the pilot was restrained?
2-774	There's something I want to discuss with everyone.\nCould I have a moment of your time?
2-775	No, why would I be? I'm fine...!
2-776	Right. When the Ferronis starts moving, we won't have\nenough time. We'll have to do something before then...
2-777	I can't believe Nimue's here...
2-778	Wonderful, she said...
2-779	Just like the image Nimue showed me...
2-780	This should be worth a look.
2-781	We need the three kinds of parts\nand an ether cylinder.
2-783	Guess that's proof the Ferronis works. And it works\nout well for us - we can hide in the clouds.
2-784	We'll take him down for sure!
2-785	No they weren't. Have they been\ndrawn by the husks, maybe?
2-786	A City Torpedo wrap, eh? This has me\ncurious.
2-787	The Pedesto Valley Floor is ahead.
2-788	Let's follow them.
2-789	Collection complete.
2-790	We should head back.
2-796	Some kind of abnormality in the\necosystem? This is intriguing...
2-798	Seven Origin shards on this island...
2-799	I wouldn't exactly say pals. The commander\nis more akin perhaps to your "chief" status.
2-800	That's right. There are Skeeter nests\naround here as well - we should take care.
2-801	I never thought we'd be able to find\na Sirius Anemone here!
2-802	Valdi, is that Levnis...?
2-804	That Nopon is fishy however you look\nat it. We should remain wary of him.
2-805	Going off what we heard, it's someone who's\noften in and out of the Levnis maintenance bay.
2-807	Just how much ether are they guzzling\nto build Dorrick?
2-808	We should be able to find\nVaren in maintenance.
2-809	I heard that Colony 30 once drove off Colony Iota,\neven though Iota are ranked Silver...
2-810	Valdi... Just how were you planning\non lugging all this back to Colony 30?
2-811	Seriously, how could our whereabouts\nhave been leaked?
2-812	I think we've found out all that we can now.
2-814	Do you see any other way?\nJust...try not to look down.
2-815	The longer we fight, the more we\nrisk reinforcements arriving.
2-816	If at all possible, we want to avoid\nfighting multiple Levnises at once.
2-817	Now we can follow the route above.\nThat should get us over to the elevator.
2-818	We should locate some device that'll\nreverse the direction it spins.
2-819	It's hard to tell the difference between\nore and a gemstone.
2-823	It appears we can pass through here.
2-824	Let me check.
2-826	Wait for a moment.
2-827	Using that device should allow us to proceed.
2-828	Over there...
2-829	Hm... The way won't be simple.
2-831	The colony holds some deeply alien customs...
2-832	Once a certain notion takes root,\nexcising it is no mean feat.
2-833	The world outside your colony\nmust hold many wonders for you.
2-834	I'm curious to see what tactics you have in\nplace surrounded by so much nature.
2-836	Leave her be for now, Sena.\nShe won't respond while's she's so stressed.
2-837	Whoever's on watch must\nhave the key.
2-838	Looks like there's no\nturning back after this.
2-839	Noah, move those trotters!
2-840	Let's get ourselves kitted out with\nsome good gear for the road ahead!
2-841	What's this...?
2-842	Let's pocket it then.
2-843	Uh, just guessing, but...
2-844	Is that the hatch that\nleads to the channel?
2-845	This the right way?
2-846	Let's check what's down\nthis corridor first!
2-847	Sounds like a scoop.
2-848	I love me a good story!
2-851	I bet Bolearis is crawling out of his\nskin with worry right about now.
2-853	All right, Riku's countin' on us,\nso let's get him his rocks!
2-854	It's all a bit over my head,\nbut sure, let's do it!
2-855	Welp, no use whinging!\nLet's get to it.
2-856	Didn't expect *you* to get so fired up...
2-857	Hey, you're not getting all soppy\non us now, are you?
2-858	Arright, asking time!\n...Uh, who do we ask?
2-859	Sweet, that should be everything. Won't lie,\nit's got me kinda pumped for the result!
2-861	Aww, you guys are best buds now?\nThat's nice!
2-862	Everything'll be just dandy, mate!\nShow some faith, yeah?
2-863	Man up. If you don't get in,\nyou're getting left behind, mate.
2-864	They're just green. But trust me, they fight as much\nas you or me. Only here, it's with their inner demons.
2-865	OK, I'll say what everyone's thinking.\nThis is all sparking amazing!
2-866	Huh! I'll file that away under\n"good to know".
2-867	Why quit while we're ahead?\nLet's stamp out Moebius for good!
2-868	So you're saying it's all thanks to us, right?
2-870	How's the supervising going,\nMr. Commander, sir? Five by five?
2-871	Gotta show Zeon what we're made of.
2-872	Hey man, I just wanted to say, uh...\nyou're doing a pretty good job, all in all.
2-873	Race you to that open plot there!
2-874	It's kinda nuts to think how much\ndifference a single spud can make.
2-875	You're wigging me out now, mate.\nDial it down a notch.
2-876	*That's* the sad part? OK...
2-878	Valdi seems happy, doesn't he? I bet he\ndoesn't get to show off like this very often.
2-879	Rhyza, eh...? I don't get\nhow a guy can be so calm...
2-880	Snuff it... We gotta hurry!
2-881	Don't do anything stupid, Melia!
2-882	I know, I know! Trust us a little.
2-883	Oh, hey, come to think of it, Melia-
2-884	It's still a work in progress, but it's set\nto become Valdi's biggest "friend" yet.
2-885	Zeon's gotta think bigger.\nThere's a whole world out there...!
2-886	Just stay focused. It's not over yet.
2-887	We'll see when we get there,\nwon't we?
2-888	All right, fish, you're in for it now!
2-889	Wow, talk about laser focus...
2-890	Uhh! Do me a favor? Keep your\nvoice down when you call me that...
2-891	We've got this in the bag!
2-892	It's not good training unless you really go for it.
2-893	Come on now, it's not the\nend of the world...
2-894	We'll see how huge it really is, yeah?
2-895	Stop playing with the shellfish...
2-896	Let's check the other ones too.
2-897	Peh. I'll show you perseverance...
2-898	Oh yeah, Fiona's crew's got more guts\nthan you'd think.
2-899	That'd be welcome.\nI'm seriously knackered...
2-900	...What?!
2-901	...What the spark *is* this, and\nwhat did an ape want with it?!
2-902	Yeah, let's clean this place up!
2-903	All things being equal,\ngrub still comes first.
2-904	Should be some juicy Piranhaxes ahead.\nLet's get the Rich Fish Meat from those!
2-906	Mwamba, if things get hairy,\nyou hide behind me, yeah?
2-907	Let's keep on routing these fools\nand keep this moving forward!
2-908	Spark these Colony Sigma mudders...
2-909	This should be enough for our\ndaily hygiene needs, eh?
2-910	Always a welcome sight.
2-911	And with how late we are,\nit should be empty, too.
2-912	I might do some spot maintenance\non our gear before I kip.
2-913	To get to the assembly point, we gotta\nrun through the Ferronis interior.
2-914	Those Chewy Radishes and Clusterelles\nshould be growing nearby, I reckon.
2-915	That's the entrance to Alfeto Valley.
2-916	So the Agnians want this thing too,\nhuh...? Whatcha think it is, Eunie?
2-917	That's all well and good, but if there *is*\na confrontation, no way am I backing down.
2-918	This op is getting weirder\nby the minute...
2-919	Eunie, we gotta move carefully.\nEven with the Agnians gone...
2-920	I'm not sure how we'll talk our way\nout of this with the brass...
2-921	How come you get to be the boss?\nI know this stuff too!
2-922	Wait, this isn't the right way, is it?\nWe'd just end up back at Alfeto Valley.
2-923	Looks like we got rid of all the\nCrustips living in the Ferronis.
2-926	All right, let's try it out on these critters.
2-927	Seriously? We only just got here.
2-928	I've been feeling really pumped\nfor the past while!
2-929	When they land, they *really* land!\nLet's dish 'em out whenever we can!
2-930	No amount of healing's gonna help\nif that thing hits us!
2-931	Without supplies, the medics\ncan't do jack...
2-932	Yeah, yeah. And we better hurry, right?\nWell then, no time like the present.
2-933	Yeah. Even at Dirt rank, it's still\nEthel's partner, I bet.
2-934	Oh hey, I just realized, I left something\nback at 4, so... Haaah, gotcha!
2-935	Starting to get real hungry now...
2-936	For sure! Let's stay on the lookout\nfor more walls to climb, yeah?
2-937	Uhh, was it this way?
2-938	Yeah, no chance of any Levnises\nfollowing us inside here.
2-939	Manana sure has a wild side, huh...
2-941	The upper level of the Great Falls, eh? Could we\nget there by clambering up Colony Lambda?
2-942	Should be reaching\nMaktha Wildwood soon.
2-943	Noah... You know how folks are when their Flame Clock\nruns low. They'll come at us like starved beasts.
2-944	Even for a place this tumbledown,\nthe people here seem so resigned...
2-945	Out of the frying pan\nand into the fire...
2-946	Hey, what's this food you were on\nabout? Did you scoff it all up already?
2-947	I don't care what this Annihilator\nthing is, we've gotta wreck it...!
2-948	Or, we could just punch clean through, quick as?
2-949	There's a whole sparkload of ether... You think this\nis where our colony's supply came from too?
2-950	Whoo! Noah and Taion's plan\nwent off without a hitch!
2-951	Wrecking that massive thing\nis gonna be a job and a half...
2-952	Right, let's hurry up then.\nWe made a right ruckus back there.
2-953	No reason to go back to the Castle,\nanyway. Let's head for Swordmarch.
2-954	Hey Noah, you know that pile of husks earlier...\nYou aren't thinking about sending those on, are you?
2-955	So we're born to fight...and then we die.\nOver, and over, and over...
2-956	And how do we get to the\nwar room?
2-957	Been a while since my last war council.\nHope this isn't one of the boring ones...
2-958	So c-c-c-cold... Whose bright idea was it to\nput a warehouse in the arse-end of nowhere...?
2-959	What? You gonna blame me for\neating too much soup or something?
2-960	This must be Corne Island,\nthe place Kisame told us about.
2-961	What's the plan? Wanna take 'em down?
2-962	How many of these\nAgnian clods are there?
2-963	Hey, looks like we can get in\nthrough here!
2-964	First Keves Castle, now Agnus Castle...
2-965	Now we have to find this\nGhondor customer.
2-966	Don't tell me we've gotta listen\nto another tedious speech...
2-967	Oh for the love of sparks! How can there\nstill be more to do?! Unbelievable!
2-968	Doing this day after day\nwould definitely get old...
2-969	Ugh, morning assembly already? I'm afraid\nI'm gonna start snoring while standing up...
2-970	Pff, today's job is way better than yesterday's,\nbut I still can't seem to work up the energy...
2-971	Yeah, yeah. No Interlinking, got it.
2-972	C'mon, let's chase this thing down.\nDon't want it getting away.
2-973	How is this even allowed?! The Lost Numbers\nlot must have the patience of a sage!
2-974	The beds here are awful,\nI barely slept a wink...
2-975	I wonder what the bossman's\ngonna have to say today.
2-976	Check you out! Someone's eager.
2-978	Yeah... Not long now\ntill we blow this joint.
2-981	This has turned into a proper\nAionios-trotting adventure.
2-982	It's been one revelation after another these days, and now\nhere we are, walking through thin air like it's totally normal.
2-983	If you fall off, you're on your own.
2-984	You wanna do some sprints after?
2-985	Kevesi and Agnian ones together...\nSnuff me...
2-986	About time, eh, Noah?
2-987	Poor clods are mounting a proper assault.
2-988	I vote we push on for now. We can always\nturn back if the going gets tough, right?
2-991	Hey, over there!\nThat lot's in trouble!
2-993	Piranhax? Shrimple enough!\nSalmon's gotta know where to look.
2-994	Seriously... Those Moebius snuffers\ncan really do one...
2-995	We'd better give 'em a proper welcome!
2-996	Well, let's go beat some sense\ninto that dumb Moebius face.
2-997	Colony 5 should be just past here, huh.
2-998	Yeah, once we get outta here,\nwe should be safe for a while...
2-1000	Don't tell me you weren't curious too!\nI wanna know all their tricks of the trade...
2-1001	Phew...
2-1002	Gotta follow.
2-1003	I'm done gathering.
2-1004	Time to head back?
2-1010	You're as much of a trespasser\nas they are, mate...
2-1011	I don't care if it's a jar or an old snuffing boot.\nI'm gonna find this thing!
2-1012	Valdi, my pal... Anyone ever tell you\nyou're a bit of an oddball?
2-1013	I bet it will. All right, let's go let him know.
2-1014	This is for Valdi's friend.\nLet's find us some materials!
2-1015	Are we meant to push straight through\nall the way to phase ten?
2-1016	Doesn't look much different,\nif I'm bein' honest...
2-1017	"Power to make peace"...?\nWhat's he come up with this time?
2-1018	Researching Agnian Levnises...?\nWhat's Valdi after here?
2-1019	I guess we did all we could to help.\nNow we get to kick back and enjoy the results.
2-1020	Couldn't tell ya. Colony 30 was\nteeming with the furballs...
2-1024	Your guess is as good as mine.\nBut I bet Yuzet's on the case.
2-1026	Whoa! That white thing is Dorrick?!
2-1028	Gotta keep a close eye on Valdi around here.\nIf he gets loose, he's never coming back.
2-1029	No Valdi, you can't go\ngawp at Levnises.
2-1030	So Gray's what passes for a\n"good bloke" round here, huh...?
2-1031	You think we're really gonna find\nwhatever Riku's after?
2-1035	Oh, looks like we can go on from here.
2-1036	Hrm? What's that?
2-1037	A cave, great. Wonder what it's like inside...
2-1038	Ooh, a container!
2-1039	...Ugh, seriously? It's right there, but there's no way to it!
2-1040	Hey. Get a load of this.
2-1041	We should be able to climb up with that.
2-1042	Hrrrrrmmmm?
2-1043	Mind if we pop over yonder for a sec?\nI'm feelin' weirdly curious.
2-1044	The colony folks are making a good go of it.\nWe shouldn't rest on our laurels, either.
2-1047	We'll never know unless we ask, yeah?
2-1048	Yeah, well, compared to your colony, maybe...
2-1049	Whoa, June, that came out of left-field...\nYou kinda creeped me out there.
2-1050	Ghondor, no runnin' off!
2-1051	We can go a few rounds if you want?
2-1052	All right, let's head back to Colony 9.
2-1053	(tsk) The bloody thing's shut.\nWon't be getting past here.
2-1056	Hey, should we go check out\nthe other side too?
2-1057	We still need a whole bunch more\nfoodstuffs and all, anyway...
2-1058	Here's a goodie!
2-1059	It's a nice find, right? ...Right?
2-1060	Guys, check this out!
2-1061	Looks like we can get to\nthe doors from here!
2-1062	Maybe it's this way...?
2-1063	How about we check out what's\ndown this passage?
2-1064	Is this...?
2-1065	Maybe we can climb up here\nto get to the upper passage.
2-1066	It's all making sense...
2-1067	Very interesting.
2-1070	Looks like this is our way down.
2-1071	I guess we won't know until\nwe get there...
2-1072	Mmm, my mouth's already watering\nthinking about your cooking, Miyabi!
2-1073	Hey, Miyabi? How did you get into\ncooking in the first place?
2-1074	Ahh... Something smells gorgeous...
2-1075	Huh?! Are you OK there, Miyabi?
2-1076	Don't worry Miyabi.\nIt's safe here, I promise...
2-1078	Take it easy.\nI'll look out for the, er, risky spots!
2-1079	Wow... This place was inside\nthe Great Sword all along?!
2-1080	Come walk beside me.\nYou'll be nice an' toasty!
2-1082	We were enemies back then, huh.\nFunny how things turn out.
2-1084	He looks angry...\nIs... Is he angry?
2-1085	Is that everyone accounted for now?
2-1086	Shall we go have a look, then?
2-1087	Hey! There's someone there!
2-1088	Imagine the look on Monica's face\nwhen she sees you!
2-1089	Oh, Fiona...
2-1090	It's OK. I'm here for you.
2-1091	Y-you're making me nervous too...
2-1092	C'mon fishies!
2-1093	I really hope they'll like it!
2-1094	Stickedy-stickers!
2-1095	Aww, Tussie's such a sweetie...
2-1096	Looks like Ayase's pepped up a bit.
2-1097	Yaaass!
2-1098	Someone else got to it first?
2-1099	Let's get back to the canteen.\nWe don't wanna keep Lotus waiting.
2-1100	Lemme think...\nThe place you're talking about is...
2-1101	Well, it's more like... I guess we just\nsort of go with the flow?
2-1102	That sounds...good? I think?
2-1103	So we're finally here...
2-1104	First, let's talk about all the stuff\nyou might wanna do in the future.
2-1105	Okey-dokey. To Colony Lambda!
2-1106	Which would mean...\nAh, I get it!
2-1107	Guess we should make\ntracks too, huh, Segiri?
2-1108	We can do that!
2-1109	I hope they like their new names...
2-1110	Segiri, look. This is where\nyou and I first met.
2-1111	Hey, everyone!\n...C'mon, Segiri, say something!
2-1112	Better let everyone know\nyou're safe and sound!
2-1113	RO-\n(quietly) ...Roger...
2-1114	Mimi, are you gonna be all right?
2-1115	You think those people\ngot away safely?
2-1116	Everything's gonna be fine, Mimi.\nHang in there.
2-1118	How are fabricators so amazing?!
2-1119	This is the route *you* wanted us\nto take, right, Taion?
2-1120	C'mon, it's just a little further to\nthe oasis! Keep it together!
2-1121	We've gotta practice our\nChain Attacks more often!
2-1122	It's a tough break, but we'll just have\nto take things as they come.
2-1123	Light at the end of the tunnel!
2-1124	Some place near the canteen,\nthey said. But, uh... Where was that?
2-1125	Figures. They're staring at us...
2-1127	You bet!
2-1128	This Ferronis... Is it Silvercoat's?
2-1129	Time to make tracks, then.
2-1130	Mimi... If we keep going this way,\nwe'll end up in the desert.
2-1131	There's a colony up ahead, right?
2-1132	Same here! I could eat a triple helping\nof Manana's cooking right about now...
2-1133	Yippee, rock climbing!\nThis should make for a great workout!
2-1134	You know what Manana just told me? She said that\nin the night, the trees wake up and start to wander...
2-1135	Gotta hand it to you, Taion.\nYou brew a mean herbal tea!
2-1136	Better get ready to take the plunge!
2-1137	That gives us a little breathing time.
2-1140	Think we can get back to the\nUrayan Tunnels from here?
2-1141	If you're having a hard time, Mimi,\nI'll be more than happy to carry you!
2-1142	I wonder if they could teach me\nto do that...
2-1143	Not a lotta people around...
2-1144	We've SO gotta do that again!
2-1145	Guess we know what's on\nthe menu today, then!
2-1146	We're going downwards.\nIs this the right way?
2-1147	Ah, Mimi...?
2-1148	Touchdown!
2-1149	Gotta be all sneaky-like around here.
2-1150	Lanz, shhh! Keep it down!
2-1151	Whoa! This is some view!
2-1152	This is our escape route, right?
2-1153	The channel keeps on going.
2-1154	Haha...\nI'm starting to get butterflies...
2-1155	So, that girl was keeping an eye\non us... Did you notice, Mimi?
2-1156	A ship, huh? I'm on board for that!
2-1157	You bet!
2-1158	So she was all alone out here...
2-1159	Hold on. Agnian soldiers.
2-1160	So this is Thurbin Island. We'll find\nErythia Relay Base here, right?
2-1161	Well this sure was...inventive.
2-1162	There it is! Agnian military info terminal!
2-1163	So there really was a cave here...
2-1164	Is this about the right place?
2-1165	Patience is golden...
2-1166	Stop whining and get to it already!\nYou're just dragging this out!
2-1167	Phew, there's so much you can\ngather around here...
2-1168	You've gotta pay attention or\nthey're gonna get real mad!
2-1169	The pawprints lead deeper\ninto the woodland...!
2-1170	Guess that wraps up today's work.
2-1171	OK, cool it!\nJust...bear with it, for now!
2-1172	We can't afford to flub tomorrow's mission, huh...\nI really hope it'll all go to plan...
2-1173	Oh, it's gonna be great. You know it.
2-1174	It's Garaffas that we're supposed\nto be thinning out, right?
2-1175	So we're meeting Ghondor outside\nWatchtower No. 1.
2-1176	That's the west gate, right?
2-1178	Yeah, after this, I could sleep for a week.\nWe've really been put through the wringer...
2-1179	I've gotta say, the hair really\nsuits you, Mimi!
2-1180	First off is the west gate, right?
2-1181	But we need to swing by\nColony Omega before that...
2-1182	No way...\nIt really *is* Colony Omega...
2-1183	We've just gotta stick it out\na little longer then!
2-1184	Ahh, at last!
2-1185	You think we'll be able to meet\nthe real Queen soon...?
2-1186	These entrance stairs are super long...\nHey, that gives me an idea!
2-1187	We're getting an Origin metal readout\nfrom around this area, I think?
2-1188	Looks like we got all the metal!
2-1189	Are Ghondor and Monica going\nto be OK?
2-1190	Actually getting to meet both Queens...\nIsn't this crazy, Mimi?!
2-1191	But they're never gonna beat us!
2-1192	It doesn't look like we can\nInterlink in here...
2-1193	It's raining... Maybe we should\ngo check up on the Armus?
2-1194	Let's get back to Colony Mu,\nsee how the Armus are doing.
2-1200	You think we'll be able to slip\nthrough undetected?
2-1201	The new Colony Omega's somewhere\naround here, right?
2-1203	If we just defeat Moebius,\nstuff will go back to normal, right?
2-1204	Yeah, looks like it. We need to\nget things back to normal, pronto.
2-1205	Whoa... It's so pretty...
2-1206	If it does, we'll just need Riku to\ngive it another little tune-up.
2-1207	We've gotta be super cautious\naround here...
2-1208	We're almost out!
2-1209	Ho ho ho! Lanz, you're a glutton\nfor punishment, aintcha?
2-1210	The shop that sells them should\nbe just across the bridge!
2-1211	We never got to eat any Torpedo wraps...
2-1212	Lanz...?
2-1221	But it's got a nice view!
2-1222	Was your friend a military cook? His cooking\nskills were pretty decent, right?
2-1223	Hey, Valdi, is Yuzet not around?
2-1224	So their friends didn't return?\nThat sounds kinda worrying.
2-1226	I dunno, but at this rate they'll\nhave the work done in a snap!
2-1227	So the difficult part's just begun?
2-1228	You can tell?\nWow, you're a real pro, Valdi!
2-1230	That's one worry out of the way!
2-1232	So they take good care of them? The mechanics\nmust really take pride in their work!
2-1233	Right, Mimi?\nIt's pretty mind-blowing.
2-1234	It's locked tight...
2-1235	We'll need to look around for\nthe device that opens it.
2-1236	I didn't realize how much fun\nit could be looking for ore!
2-1237	Relax, we'll be down in just a sec!
2-1241	...Oh, hey!
2-1242	Over here!
2-1243	We just gotta commit to the motion!
2-1244	Is that...?
2-1245	Uhh... Wonder if there's another way somewhere...
2-1246	Hey, check it out!
2-1247	We can climb up from there!
2-1248	No worries, Brunella!\nWe'll be with you all the way!
2-1249	Just don't touch it without asking!
2-1250	I'm sure it'll be fine...\nLet's go check.
2-1251	Don't stray from the group, Juniper!\nWhat if you got lost, huh?
2-1252	I somehow doubt that'd work...
2-1253	Good for you Ghondor,\nstaying calm in a place like this...
2-1254	Aww, this gate's shut too.
2-1255	This way.
2-1256	A route lies before us...
2-1257	That's...
2-1258	I hope something of use is inside...
2-1259	Let's see what's going on...
2-1260	We obtained useful intelligence.
2-1261	Such a pleasant fragrance...
2-1262	Shall we eat? They say an army\nmarches on its stomach.
2-1263	Look!
2-1264	There's an ether channel!\nWhat shall we do?
2-1265	Ah...!
2-1266	Husks... Would you mind, Noah?
2-1267	Wait.
2-1268	Something's not right... Keep your guard up!
2-1269	Whoever thought that we would\njoin forces like this?
2-1270	Indeed. I'd prefer to take\nthe shortest route...
2-1271	Head for the smoke rising from the container.\nThat's our drop point!
2-1272	Hah. I feel very much the same.
2-1273	Hurry back to Colony 4!
2-1274	Why...does this place feel so familiar?
2-1275	So this is Keves Castle...
2-1276	I hope I can repay the City folk someday...
2-1277	Cammuravi would be quivering\nin fear right about now...
2-1278	Origin... The place where everything started...
2-1279	Those... Those are Ferronises!
2-1280	Heh. Now, I could probably pilot\nthis alone...
2-1281	I really ought to see Travis sometime...
2-1282	You know, I hear that Armu sirloin is delicious.
2-1283	Such a huge structure, concealed in the whirlpool...
2-1284	What is it that drives those rebels to fight...?
2-1285	A moment's lapse here will cost your life. Be careful!
2-1286	Our opponents here are a league above. Watch your step!
2-1287	Meh? Scent of treasure\nthis way come!
2-1288	Riku must know its secrets!
2-1289	Riku will make inquiries.
2-1290	Riku gain valuable info.
2-1291	Can see flow of ether...
2-1292	This place full of ether!
2-1293	Noah not wanting to send off?
2-1294	Riku know what Noah thinking.
2-1305	Took too long to get to\nroot of matter. Gave up.
2-1306	Is perhaps good moment to\ninvest time in gem crafting?
2-1307	Could be crafting gems,\nwith right materials.
2-1308	Can always use gems to\nreinforce weapons!
2-1311	Where Tempapa supposed to be?
2-1312	Manana filled with great expect!
2-1313	Manana feel like pebble\nin ocean of rock...
2-1314	Rocks all look same to Manana...
2-1343	Manana ready for action!\nSure to find many-aplenty!
2-1350	Time to meet living legend, alive!
2-1352	Manana not quite sure,\nbut happy to blindly follow!
2-1353	Many thankings in advance for\ncollection of ingredients!
2-1354	Oh?
2-1355	Seems we have a way forward.
2-1356	Well, well.
2-1357	I think this should prove useful.
2-1358	Hmm... Let's make some inquiries.
2-1359	Very informative, thank you.
2-1360	I see an ether channel.
2-1361	Look at this! Let's see if we can't\nget some use out of it.
2-1362	Fallen soldiers...
2-1363	It would only be right to give them\nthe proper repose.
2-1364	We want to reach the cave-in.
2-1365	First off, we'll need to find a way up.
2-1366	Let's use that elevator.
2-1367	We can use this to get up above.
2-1368	Once we're off the next elevator,\nwe should be right there.
2-1369	Come on, let's get to it.
2-1370	These footprints... This may be the\nwork of a professional.
2-1371	They're headed in that direction.
2-1372	An intruder... I don't like this one bit.
2-1373	I suppose we should be thankful that\nno one was attacked.
2-1374	This brings back memories.
2-1375	I really applied myself in training to\nbecome a model soldier.
2-1376	Let's hurry into the tunnels.
2-1377	The tunnels are up ahead.
2-1378	We're close to the site of the cave-in.\nLet's pick up the pace!
2-1379	Could you join me in the\nCommander's Office?
2-1380	The Auto-Levs are stationed in\nthe cave at the Pira Bluffs.
2-1381	A "natural spa", eh? Hard to imagine\nwhat that might even look like...
2-1382	Discovering the unknown serves\nas a good motivator.
2-1383	At least people have heard of\nthis "natural spa" phenomenon...
2-1384	The more I hear about these natural\nspas, the more curious I become...
2-1385	Quite a point of interest from the\nlook of things.
2-1386	There's an unusual smell coming\nfrom over on the right...
2-1387	Could it be that our natural spa\nis up ahead...?
2-1388	So this is the natural spa we've\nbeen looking for...
2-1389	Nimue's here, then...
2-1390	I can't seem to calm my nerves.
2-1391	Saffronias... Truly, a thing of beauty...
2-1393	We can do the final approval\nin the Commander's Office.
2-1394	Sorry, would you mind stopping by\nthe Commander's Office?
2-1395	We can talk more near the entrance\nto Maktha Wildwood.
2-1396	Let's hurry to the lower levels.
2-1397	Indeed. We should be at our\ndestination soon.
2-1398	Time to head back to the Commander's\nOffice and debrief everyone.
2-1399	I see some familiar faces here.
2-1400	So this is Colony Omega. I'd only\nheard whispers...
2-1401	I see. So this is where you were\nstationed, Taion.
2-1402	So this is the illustrious Commander\nAlexandria's colony.
2-1403	I'd heard that Colony Tau had some\npeculiar customs, but this...?
2-1404	Their position is fine, but I foresee\ndifficulties trying to fight on this terrain.
2-1405	I've heard the commander here is\nquite the Levnis gearhead.
2-1406	Looking at these flowers, it gets so\neasy to lose myself in thought...
2-1407	It's so imposing... Oppressive, even,\nseeing it in the flesh.
2-1409	I'm so glad to see you've fallen in\nwith a good bunch.
2-1410	Hey! We can get through here!
2-1411	How about it?
2-1412	Hey, is that anything?
2-1413	Something useful inside maybe?
2-1414	Maybe we should ask around...?
2-1415	OK. I'm glad I asked.
2-1416	Ah... That's making me hungry.
2-1417	Are you guys hungry?
2-1418	An ether channel...
2-1419	How much should we draw?
2-1420	These husks...
2-1421	Should we send them off?
2-1422	Oh! Boxy!
2-1423	Maybe we should ask her...?
2-1424	Let's talk to Rozana!
2-1425	People were saying she won the contest before.
2-1426	Can we find out something from Mei?
2-1427	She gave me a "nibble" dipped in\nChoclit Sauce the other day!
2-1428	Heheh! I wonder what they're drawing there...
2-1429	Is that...the Has-Been Bean King?
2-1430	Hey, could we listen to this\nperformance a little?
2-1431	What a wonderful sound...
2-1432	Wow!
2-1433	So this is how it looks from above!
2-1434	Hmm... Someone who catches our eye?
2-1435	They must know lots about the contest!
2-1436	Sure! Let's ask them.
2-1437	Thanks, everyone.\nWe've heard from lots of people now.
2-1438	Teehee, me too!
2-1439	What sort of food do you think\nManana will make?
2-1440	Teehee! I'll put my heart into it...
2-1441	Mmm... Ahh.\nI think that helped, yeah... Thanks, Noah!
2-1442	I learned from Boxy! She's a\nreally good teacher.
2-1443	Boxy must be making some\nSoyprimo Sauce...
2-1444	I wonder if Manana knows how to pick\nout a good Armu?
2-1445	Easy does it... (gulp)
2-1446	(swallow) (ulp) Urgh...\nThink I...swallowed some water...
2-1447	(coughing)
2-1448	We could trip in this sand...\nGot to make sure I don't fall over...
2-1449	Keep calm... Just go slowly...\nYou're not gonna fall, Miyabi...
2-1451	The radiant Flame Clock...
2-1452	Sena... Colony Gamma, is it...?
2-1453	Hey, Mio... What kind of person\nis the commander?
2-1454	So this is Noah, Lanz and Eunie's old colony...
2-1456	Beautiful... I'll just take in the evening\nsun for a moment.
2-1457	H-hey, maybe we shouldn't go any further...
2-1458	I-I have a really bad feeling about\nwhat's up ahead...
2-1460	So many hopes rest here...
2-1461	It's a picture book, about the Has-Been Bean King\nand his efforts to thwart the rotten Legume Empire!
2-1462	Teehee... Imagine an old Eunie...\nOr old Miyabi!
2-1463	Over there! Could it be...
2-1464	A new way opens up to us...
2-1465	A treasure chest...
2-1466	What could be within?
2-1467	I will speak to them.
2-1468	An interesting conversation indeed...
2-1469	...My hunger is stirred...
2-1470	Should we eat? Fortify the spirit?
2-1471	This feeling... Is it ether?
2-1472	Just as I thought...
2-1473	Is that...?
2-1474	Dead, but not at peace...
2-1475	Huh! Those machines...
2-1476	That stirs the memory...\nOr am I deceived?
2-1477	What's that spinning thing...?
2-1478	Some kind of training?\nPerhaps I should try...
2-1479	Uh...? Is that...?
2-1480	Is that you...?\nWhat crime did you commit?
2-1483	High places...sap my resolve.
2-1484	Walking around with dirty feet...\nUgh, disgraceful!
2-1485	Ah... I'm still a little unsteady...
2-1486	We can't allow the lost to founder...\nAllow me to take charge.
2-1487	Hmm...
2-1488	Very well. Tell me when you've decided.
2-1489	I will not pursue the shadows of the\npast any longer.
2-1490	Right, Ethel?
2-1491	A place of learning for new soldiers...\nPerhaps I can study here too?
2-1492	Shall we stop in on Travis\nwhile we're here?
2-1493	Musical instruments...\nWhat purpose do they serve...?
2-1494	...Wait. We're not headed for the\nlookout, are we?!
2-1495	I am the calm amidst the storm...\nI am the moon, reflected in a stream...
2-1496	I do not want to ride that vehicle.
2-1497	This is a warzone for these little ones.\nThey fight each other for territory.
2-1498	I'm growing quite accustomed, yes.\nJust as long as I don't look down...
2-1499	I help the soldiers overcome weakness...\nOn Travis's urging, I should say.
2-1500	Ethel's a real bookworm.\nShe's always pestering me for more reading material.
2-1501	She's really taken to training. But she keeps\ngetting the better of all the grown soldiers...
2-1502	By the way, I seem to have angered Michiba, earlier...\nShe's hard to read. Any ideas, Noah?
2-1503	I like this place...\nIt has an aura of calm about it.
2-1504	The Remembrance Stones, was it...?\nA place to still the heart, so I'm told.
2-1505	Ethel hid in a container the other day...\nFinding her was a mighty task.
2-1506	The soldiers here...\nThey're not exactly the most soldierly.
2-1507	Such altitude...
2-1508	Please... Let's move past here quickly.
2-1509	What's that...?
2-1510	Look. Maybe we can go this way.
2-1511	Here. Found something you might like.
2-1512	Be sure to exercise due caution.
2-1513	Time to gather some intel.
2-1514	Lemme tell you what I just heard.
2-1515	Hm? I smell cooking.
2-1516	Smells good.\nHow about we grab something?
2-1517	An ether channel.
2-1518	Should we fill up?
2-1519	More husks...
2-1520	Better see them off...\nI don't mind waiting.
2-1521	Here!
2-1522	We're in luck.\nThe place is empty today.
2-1523	This way.
2-1524	This is Garrett's place.
2-1525	We can get down over there!
2-1526	Hurry!
2-1531	Hold on a minute.
2-1532	...I'll come again soon.\nKeep an eye on me, would you?
2-1533	Is there something we can do\nto help...?
2-1534	You must be due soon...\nLook after yourself, will ya?
2-1535	Hey, kids...!
2-1536	You get yourselves home before dark, yeah?
2-1537	Just keep following Shania, will you?\nWe'll talk more later.
2-1538	Heh. You'd better save some of\nthat surprise...
2-1539	Save a bit of surprise, I said!
2-1540	We'll leave you behind if you don't\nquit your gawking!
2-1541	Ah yeah, that happens when you gain\naltitude fast. Don't worry, it'll subside.
2-1542	Hah! It is, is it?\nI guess I can't deny it.
2-1543	I'll introduce you to them another time.
2-1544	You know Michiba Canteen? If you're looking\nfor a good meal in the City, it's hard to beat.
2-1545	Yeah, he's a smart cookie. He and\nmy dad had their fair share of run-ins.
2-1546	Please be safe...
2-1547	Hurry!
2-1548	Doesn't seem to have been too\neventful here...
2-1549	Taking the Castle was a helluva\nwin for us.
2-1550	If Mio hadn't warned us, the City\ncould've ended up just like this place...
2-1552	No... We can't afford to stop here...
2-1553	They'll finally be free from fighting\na war they never wanted...
2-1554	The Queen... We've been looking\nfor her for so long...
2-1555	So this is your home turf?
2-1556	I never thought the day would come when we'd\nbe able to launch a direct attack on Keves Castle...
2-1557	I'm sure.
2-1558	Not at all. Anybody would be impressed\nat agriculture like this.
2-1559	We do, but we have them indoors.\nIt gives us full control of the soil and climate.
2-1560	There are pretty nasty critters roaming\nabout here. Let's watch how we go.
2-1561	I didn't expect you guys to lend\na hand with the ceremony...
2-1562	I'm letting myself down as Elder here.\nI'll get things ready as soon as I can.
2-1563	Kryto's really coming of age...\nNever thought I'd see the day.
2-1564	All the girls are gonna be at each\nother's throats. Hope he can handle it...
2-1565	That won't be necessary. I just want\nyou to be there for them, as friends.
2-1566	Thank you, I'm happy about it too.\nBoth as Elder, and as a parent...
2-1567	It's finally happening...!\nNo... I can't get emotional...
2-1568	I should keep calm and\nsimply enjoy the festivities.
2-1569	Shania...\nWe can't leave your name here, but...
2-1570	Your desires, your hopes...\nWe'll shoulder them for you.
2-1571	Oh...!
2-1572	Here... It's just up ahead.
2-1573	I see something, over there!
2-1574	I hope there's something of use inside!
2-1575	Please, allow me.
2-1576	I found out something really interesting.\nI hope it's of some use to you!
2-1577	This way...
2-1578	Heheh... You'd never guess,\nbut I'm really sensitive to ether.
2-1579	Are those...husks?
2-1580	Please... Allow their hopes and desires\nto gain rest, with your melody...
2-1581	This fragrance...
2-1582	Aha. I knew it.
2-1583	Those empty ruins...
2-1584	...
2-1585	(gasp)
2-1586	Amazing...
2-1587	Hey, I'm back.
2-1588	Cold...!
2-1589	It's too hot for me...
2-1590	Haven't been here for a while...
2-1591	This is where you found your destiny.\nWhere you became Ouroboros...
2-1592	Melia and I, meeting face to face again...\nNow this will be an occasion.
2-1594	What, really? No... You're imagining it.
2-1595	Uhm... I'm supposed to be incognito.\nSome other time, maybe...?
2-1596	Something fishy!
2-1597	Let's finish it right here...\nFor the future that we all want!
2-1598	Ghondor...
2-1599	I think...I might need a moment\nto reflect...
2-1600	Ah, over there...
2-1601	A way has been paved for us.
2-1602	A welcome reward.
2-1603	Shall we open it?
2-1605	So that's what it was all about.
2-1606	Something smells exquisite.
2-1607	...Shall we drop in, perhaps?
2-1608	There's ether in the area.
2-1609	We might replenish our supplies here.
2-1610	Wait. Perhaps they are injured.
2-1611	Ah, already perished...\nHow unfortunate...
2-1612	Over there?
2-1613	We must tend to the wounded.
2-1614	Follow my lead, everyone!
2-1615	A diplomatic mission, is it?
2-1616	Surely we can find a peaceful\nresolution...
2-1617	Nor should *you*, Lanz!
2-1618	Sena, that isn't something to be\nexcited about...
2-1619	How long has it been since I last\nsaw civilization...
2-1620	A walking encyclopedia, is he? Then we\ncan expect an enlightening conversation.
2-1621	It's quite all right.\nLife is full of surprises, after all.
2-1622	No, I will not falter.\nThere is but one path to take...
2-1623	Colony 4... Its rank was formerly\nSilver, if I'm not mistaken.
2-1624	I find it hard to accept this place\ncould be Dirt rank now...
2-1625	The Silver spirit still shines through,\nemblazoned on these warriors' hearts.
2-1626	Silvercoat Ethel...\nShe was a commander of great acuity.
2-1627	Would that we could have met...
2-1628	Farming, here as well? How admirable!
2-1629	What a joy it is to be experiencing\nthese sights firsthand again...
2-1630	You aren't to open those.\nThey're...highly confidential!
2-1631	Now, no nosying around...
2-1632	Do you like flowers?\nI find they soothe the heart.
2-1633	That and...I'm reminded of those\nwho so dearly cherished them.
2-1634	Remember, no one is to know\nof my presence here. No one.
2-1635	Shhh! Do not speak my name here!\nYou'll blow my cover!
2-1636	Strange, isn't it? I knew so much\nof the world already, and yet...
2-1637	These sights and sounds are all so new and fresh.
2-1638	This canteen always seems to be\nbustling no matter the hour.
2-1639	I wonder what kinds of food\nthey serve?
2-1642	Live long enough in the shadows and one\ncomes to perceive even the faintest light...
2-1643	I believe it is the same for them...
2-1644	Yes, I suspected the soldiers may\nhave some idiosyncrasies here.
2-1645	It takes a special individual to keep\nthese ruffians in check.
2-1646	Ashera must be a woman of true grit.
2-1647	The fighting here is about as brutal\nas they come, yes...
2-1648	But Ashera alone seemed to take it\nin her stride. I remember it well.
2-1649	I must commend Colony 11 for their tremendous\nachievements. In truth, I feel somewhat intimidated...
2-1652	The things these engineers have\ncreated take my breath away...
2-1653	I heard there were a number of Nopon here,\nbut I never expected *this* many!
2-1654	I imagine there's not a boring\nmoment around here...
2-1657	An impressive contraption...\nWhat could it be for?
2-1658	Tilling is certainly one way to\nenrich the bad soil.
2-1659	What a radically different approach\nthe colony is taking...
2-1660	Haha... It may be their similarities that\nmake them prone to these altercations...
2-1661	I imagine behind Lanz and Zeon's comic facade,\nthere lies a good friendship.
2-1662	You really love Colony 9, don't you, Eunie?\nI can tell from the way your wings perk up.
2-1663	Hey! Come look at this!
2-1664	Where d'you think it connects to?
2-1665	Check out what I found!
2-1666	Anything decent in there?
2-1667	We should ask around!
2-1668	We haven't heard much about this\nyet, right?
2-1669	...Something smells tasty!
2-1670	I'm starved. Let's grab something!
2-1671	Whoa, it's an ether channel!
2-1672	We *have* to mine this!
2-1673	Ah...
2-1674	You're gonna send them off, right?
2-1675	Look! Here it is!
2-1676	I've got a bunch of goodies\nstashed inside!
2-1677	Wait. Is that...?
2-1678	Those are the things that Isurd wants defeated!
2-1685	Whoa! These are the Levnises the\neyepatch folks use!
2-1686	How are they getting on here, anyway?\nHope we get to nosy around more...
2-1693	Those are the Levnises your colony\npilots, Noah?
2-1694	You've gotta bring one along sometime!\nThe Nopon'll love it!
2-1699	Hmm, I dunno! If you say so though!
2-1700	Right up ahead! We might find\na nice haul where we fought before!
2-1701	I'd recognize that engine sound\nanywhere... It's an Equites!
2-1702	Nice! That should do us!
2-1703	Huh, you're right...\nI wonder where he's gone?
2-1704	Hey, tell me something.\nAre you and Isurd pals, Taion?
2-1705	With any luck, that'll lighten\nIsurd's load.
2-1706	Phew, now I'm friends with Isurd...\nYuzet has so got to hear about this!
2-1707	What's going on in Colony 4 exactly?
2-1708	We'd better go find them quick!
2-1709	See? I can get things done when I put\nmy mind to it!
2-1710	You wanna see?! It's still a work in progress,\nbut I could give you a little sneak peek!
2-1711	Thanks, Lanz! Thanks all!\nYou're being great friends to Dorrick!
2-1712	We can take it slow. There's a ton of\nscrap out there for us to collect!
2-1713	Cool - now he just needs the\n"power to make peace"! Let's roll!
2-1714	We'll need a good color for Dorrick's\nchassis... Hrmmm...
2-1715	There they are! The Levnises from\nthe third unit!
2-1720	We're going down to maintenance?!\nThat's like, Levnis central!
2-1721	I've gotta ask him what makes\nthose Agnian Levnises tick!
2-1725	Whaddaya think? Awesome or what?
2-1727	There's so many flowers! I wonder if\nsomething brought them here too?
2-1728	Guess the Colony 9 commander really\nlikes his spuds...
2-1729	Wow! The Levnises around here sure\nare a lively bunch!
2-1730	Time to go see the Levnises that the\neyepatch folk use!
2-1731	I didn't know that. I'll have to ask Yuzet\nabout it sometime!
2-1732	Incredible! Maybe they'd let me borrow\na Levnis if I ask nicely...?
2-1733	They've all been wrecked...\nWe've gotta bring them all home!
2-1734	Wha- Are you a mind reader?!
2-1735	So this is a Ferron unit!
2-1736	Don't make any sudden movements.
2-1737	Those vermin...
2-1738	The soil smells so rich here...
2-1739	A good place.
2-1740	This earth is what matters!
2-1741	Just you wait, Earthwormwood!
2-1742	Are they budding yet...?
2-1743	It must work!
2-1744	Apologies, but I have to find out!
2-1745	Please, don't let it come true...
2-1746	I swear I will save you...\nDon't fail me now!
2-1747	For the fields!
2-1748	If Mio's thinking turns out to be true,\nthen...
2-1749	Fox must be stopped, at all cost!
2-1750	The fields are over there.
2-1751	They're looking hale and hearty!
2-1752	Ho there!
2-1753	Is there anything we can help with?
2-1754	I am always agog at the splendor\nof these fields...
2-1755	It's a sight to behold.\nAnd what's more...
2-1756	They're nutritious.
2-1757	I think...
2-1758	Yes, this is the way forward.
2-1759	A good haul.
2-1760	Just as I thought.
2-1761	We should see what they have to say.
2-1762	New info has come to light.
2-1763	This smell...
2-1764	Time to eat, then? No?
2-1765	An ether channel.
2-1766	Let's stock up.
2-1767	Husks...
2-1768	You'll be doing them a service.
2-1769	(Mio's ears are quite striking...\nDo they really grow from her head...?)
2-1770	Yes, thank you. Now zip your\nmouth and let's move.
2-1771	I expect great things from you,\n*former* Special Forces Lanz.
2-1772	If you find anything out of the ordinary,\nI'll issue the order.
2-1773	They've been worn down mentally\nand physically. We have to act now.
2-1774	Rare for you to be cheering me up...\nMakes it all the more precious.
2-1775	It's just so verdant here.\nVery different from back home...
2-1776	This field... How ample its furrows!
2-1777	You think I can't hold my own?
2-1778	If only my presence brought the rain...\nOnce again, I'm powerless.
2-1779	Coming here, I think back to the day\nof the mission...
2-1780	It's like looting their resting place...\nNot pleasant, however you look at it.
2-1781	Promise never to desert on my\nwatch, Noah?
2-1782	Fox... But why...?
2-1783	Somehow I think this talk isn't going\nto go very well. Let's hurry!
2-1784	So Kite is here...
2-1785	A potato with the power to change\nhearts... Now that's a tuber to tout.
2-1786	Oh dear. Seeing potatoes always\nmakes my stomach grumble.
2-1787	Rejoice! This soil should be perfect\nfor Spongy Spuds!
2-1788	It's time to show you the true power of Spongy Spuds!
2-1789	The soil's not too acidic. And it looks\nto be getting enough moisture.
2-1790	I'm calling it now. Spongy Spuds are\nreally going to take off around here!
2-1791	It's so sad to see a place with no\narable land...
2-1792	Incredible. I feel the energy of the\ntrees...
2-1793	Greenery can be so soothing.
2-1794	Witnessing a waterfall this mighty really\nhits home how insignificant we are.
2-1795	The water's so clear. There's such\nan abundance of life here.
2-1796	I feel at home again, seeing all these\nfriendly faces.
2-1797	I enjoy seeing them grow.\nIt's really quite magical.
2-1798	Gorgeous... I'd love for the people of\nColony 9 to see this.
2-1799	A stunning view, but the vegetation\nis what interests me.
2-1800	This is the world that we live in.
2-1801	What's that?! I've never seen\nthat kind of weed before!
2-1802	I see...\nNow I'd *really* like to look around.
2-1803	I suddenly have this feeling of being watched...
2-1804	What an incredible place...\nI'm glad I lived long enough to see it!
2-1805	So this is the Castle... Intimidating\nwould be an understatement.
2-1806	I'll make a note of this place. Could you\ngive me the details, Taion?
2-1807	Taion, would you have a minute?\nI'd like to discuss agronomy.
2-1808	It feels wrong to act like he's still\nthe old Mwamba. It's just not true...
2-1809	It's huge. To think they made\nsomething so enormous...
2-1810	Could we put this technology to good\nuse? Say, in the fields?
2-1811	Here's to new beginnings.
2-1812	I'm itching for the harvest.
2-1815	That was delicious.\nHallmark Castle cuisine.
2-1816	This way.
2-1817	The path continues on.
2-1818	Hmm...
2-1819	Something in that container?
2-1820	One moment.
2-1821	Have I a tale to tell!
2-1822	Ether signs...
2-1823	This vein looks rich in ether.
2-1824	Husks...
2-1825	We should at least give them repose...
2-1826	This way, everyone.
2-1827	Watch your step.
2-1828	If memory serves...
2-1829	Somewhere we can rest.\nLet's take a breather.
2-1830	I can hardly spoil the surprise now,\ncan I? Trust me, it'll be worth the wait.
2-1831	Keep that up, everyone. You've all\ngood heads on your shoulders.
2-1832	Not far now. Perseverance, people!
2-1833	Let's head back to Colony Gamma.\nYou...know what you have to do, yes?
2-1834	That's correct.\nLet's discuss our next steps...
2-1835	It's Everblight Plain.\nWell, then? Shall we set out?
2-1836	We should start out by looking\nfor the containers.
2-1837	Kyrie's a stout-hearted soldier.\nHave faith in her.
2-1838	We have to get to Rottswoe Battlescar.\nI must find Kyrie...
2-1839	To think I would return here,\nof all places...
2-1840	If you need some guidance,\nyou're always welcome.
2-1841	Gamma is as vibrant as ever\nonce again, thanks to you.
2-1842	Colony 11...\nThey're as skilled as the rumors say.
2-1843	Hmm. The current Iota commander\nlooks rather capable.
2-1844	The people of Mu are strong, to live without a care.
2-1845	I promised to watch over your futures.\nAnd I will see it through.
2-1846	Let us bring an end to this\ntumultuous era.
2-1847	Let's take another route this time.
2-1848	I hear there's a stunning view\nof the falls from over there.
2-1849	Fascinating to find a manmade road\nin a place like this.
2-1850	Whenever you see a cave, you must always give\nit a good spelunking. You agree, of course.
2-1851	There must be a way to\nget down from here...
2-1852	Hmm... It looks like there must be\na way to climb even higher.
2-1853	Oh, it's like a little back road.\nI wonder where it goes.
2-1854	A secret beach!\nIt just screams treasure, doesn't it?
2-1855	What's this?
2-1856	Just as I thought.\nWe can pass through here.
2-1857	I spy treasure.
2-1858	We can hardly leave it.
2-1859	We're going to need more information.
2-1860	We can put this knowledge to good use.
2-1861	Don't you think it's about time for a meal?
2-1862	I'm sure you're all starved by now.
2-1863	An ether channel, isn't it?
2-1864	Let's draw what we need.
2-1865	Husks...
2-1866	Time for the off-seers to play their part.
2-1867	Ah! That shop!
2-1868	It's for accessories! They have such\na varied selection!
2-1869	Why, they have Arduns!
2-1870	Hehe... That one reminds me of Rhyza.
2-1871	Quite an assortment\nthey've got here.
2-1872	Look at all these books!\nSublime...
2-1873	So that's...the place where\nnew humans are born?
2-1874	I'd love to sit in on the\nproduction process...
2-1875	I suppose the City records are\nkept here.
2-1876	It would take some time to peruse\nthem all... Could we stay the night?
2-1877	So these are the so-called "children"...
2-1878	And they're sixth-termers like me?\nThey must live for so long...
2-1879	I see Keves Castle really is as\ngrandiose as they say.
2-1880	I'm tempted to stir up some trouble.
2-1881	The nerve center of all Keves...
2-1882	Quite exciting, isn't it?
2-1883	Well! This defied all my expectations.
2-1884	The ceiling's so high up...
2-1885	You can't be serious...\nThis is the gardens?!
2-1886	It's so warm...\nThey must regulate the heat somehow!
2-1887	If all these Levnises were to\ndeploy at once...
2-1888	It doesn't bear thinking about.
2-1889	That's a...decent selection.
2-1890	It reminds me of Colony Iota\nin the olden times... Ah, memories.
2-1891	Really makes an impression...
2-1892	Still, it's a place of pain and misery...\nWhat's inflicted here will never heal.
2-1893	This place always takes my breath away...
2-1894	What a marvel of technology,\nto hold all this up.
2-1895	This architecture... It brings to mind\nAgnian imagery.
2-1896	If only these walls could speak...
2-1897	These people fought like demons for\nso long, and for what...?
2-1898	It makes a mockery of our lives...
2-1899	All rules are made to benefit someone.
2-1900	I see now we should learn to scrutinize\nthem before blindly obeying.
2-1901	Not far now!
2-1902	It's not too late, it's not too late!
2-1903	There's more?\nThis is altogether too large.
2-1904	Gorgeous... So they can bloom even\nat this altitude.
2-1905	I will not fail. I will not!
2-1906	He completely minced my name.\nBut otherwise, very good.
2-1907	How many Levnises does he have here?\nThese are his "friends"?
2-1908	Taion, what's your opinion on this?
2-1909	It's nothing.\nI'm just...thinking about the past.
2-1910	He's just not very expressive, is all.\nStill cute though - just like an Ardun.
2-1911	He's already in his tenth term... And he\nlooks more like an Ardun by the day!
2-1912	I see our target. That's the storehouse.
2-1913	Salazar... You will sorely regret this!
2-1914	Chickadee... Please be safe!
2-1915	Then we dash all the way up!
2-1916	We can get up top from there!
2-1917	I'm not crying... It's just something\nin my eye, all right?
2-1918	I'm sure they'll be able to explain everything.\nTaion, I'll be needing your support.
2-1919	I can't say for sure, but it doesn't look\nto be anything bad. I wouldn't worry.
2-1920	(gasp) What's that?
2-1921	Judging by those supplies,\nI would expect Fili to be there.
2-1922	Well... We can't possibly keep Fili\nwaiting now, can we?
2-1923	I'm beginning to see the bigger\npicture here now.
2-1924	We can expect an interesting story.
2-1925	I'd never even thought of using Collectopaedia Cards\nlike that... I just hope nothing bad comes of it.
2-1926	Could that be a path...?
2-1927	Hey, that looks like a way forward!
2-1928	Interesting little thing here!
2-1929	Could be handy!
2-1930	I'm going to ask around.
2-1931	I learned some useful details!
2-1932	My stomach's growling...
2-1933	Could we get a bite to eat, please?
2-1934	I found a concentrated ether source.
2-1935	Claiming these resources would be\nthe best course of action here.
2-1936	There's been fighting here...
2-1937	Would you care to send them off?
2-1938	Colony Tau is completely self-sufficient.\nWould you like to know more?
2-1939	I bet Carson would be able to\ntell you a lot about life here.
2-1940	We can use the rope slide to get to\nplaces further afield.
2-1941	Just get on and slide.
2-1942	I've never seen so many people in\none place...
2-1943	I feel a bit nervous in crowds.\nIt's like I'm being stared at.
2-1944	Having to fight in a highly-populated\narea would be pretty demanding...
2-1945	We'll have to keep our guard up...
2-1946	There's a path to the lower levels.
2-1947	It's not an easy descent.\nWatch your step.
2-1948	It's hostile territory ahead.
2-1949	If we're really going, we'll have to\nbe extra careful.
2-1950	It looks like there are Nopon living\naround here.
2-1951	We should be able to climb up\nfrom here.
2-1952	I've never really been over this side\nbefore.
2-1953	I think Colony Lambda is around here...?\nSomewhere...
2-1954	This way, please.
2-1955	It'll be faster if we climb up this way.
2-1956	I've never traveled so far from my\ncolony before.
2-1957	I'll report in to the Consul.
2-1958	Why are there monsters here?!
2-1959	We fought Kevesi here.\nMany of my friends fell...
2-1960	Please, give them a peaceful sleep.
2-1961	Let's dig up some\nSpongy Spuds!
2-1962	Let's report back to Carson.
2-1963	We only use Beaconstones for emergencies...\nI hope nothing bad's happened.
2-1964	We've found Raine!
2-1966	All right. Now to gather the offerings.
2-1967	They're not bad creatures,\nif you know how to deal with them.
2-1968	The Tirkin nest should be coming into view.
2-1969	I'm not particularly good with machines.\nI wonder if I could operate this...?
2-1971	Considering the distance, maybe it's for the best\nthat Tau don't have to go all that far.
2-1972	I really hope he'll see some sense and\nrealize how pointless the tradition is...
2-1973	Raine's hard-headed, so he might not\nbe able to accept the change so easily.
2-1974	I just hope he doesn't overdo it...
2-1975	Let's try and find out what Raine's been up to.
2-1976	Raine, I really hope you're OK...
2-1977	Looks like they're growing nicely.
2-1978	It's so imposing... I'm speechless.
2-1979	Do you get the feeling we're being\nwatched? Maybe I'm imagining it...
2-1980	Huh?! What is that thing? I've never\nseen it before...
2-1981	The big colonies have so much\ndelicious food. Augh, I can't decide!
2-1982	Fancy gadgetry like this makes my\nheart race... I hope that's not too weird.
2-1983	It's so nice here...\nThat fresh air!
2-1984	Don't worry. I'm keeping a careful eye\non our surroundings.
2-1985	I'm so sorry about what happened before...
2-1986	What say we go hunting together?\nI'm fairly well-versed in that.
2-1987	You have to still your breath and approach from\nthe back. Then, you strike. And the rest is easy.
2-1990	Ooh!
2-1991	Heads up. Second wave.
2-1992	This bloodlust...
2-1993	Here comes trouble.
2-1994	Everyone, come check this out!
2-1995	Someone has a death wish.
2-1996	Lookee here!
2-1997	How about a fight to the death, then?
2-1998	Those Ferronises...
2-1999	Ethel and Cammuravi...\nMust have been a glorious fight.
2-2000	A golden Flame Clock...?
2-2001	...This place never changes.
2-2002	It's just up ahead.
2-2003	Come on! Soldiers value speed\nabove all, you know.
2-2004	Oh!
2-2005	Well now. Nice find!
2-2006	'Scuse me.
2-2007	I'm back. With gossip!
2-2008	I'm feeling like I could eat...
2-2009	Is there anything to snack on?
2-2010	Hm? The air here...
2-2011	Look, a flow of ether.
2-2012	Husks?
2-2013	Noah, Mio, you're up.
2-2014	There are husks there too?
2-2015	One of the constancies of battle...
2-2016	It's always good to have a few good\nbattle buddies.
2-2017	All right, eyes up front.\nThe enemy's right ahead!
2-2018	Are you tired? We can rest a while.
2-2019	Let's take the fight to the enemy!\nBattle awaits!
2-2020	Prepare for a suici- er, I mean a charge!
2-2022	Hm.
2-2023	Not that that would be a bad-\nAhem. Nothing. I'll bear it in mind.
2-2024	Looks like it's down this way.
2-2025	Ha, I've got a pretty good idea\nwhat the deal is here.
2-2026	Zor, as hot-blooded as ever.
2-2027	You're a pretty weird bunch yourselves.
2-2028	Tenacious Clad... Actually,\nhe's the shy and sensitive type.
2-2029	Huh. So you know the new guy?
2-2030	My oh my, what have we got ourselves into?
2-2031	Might have to watch out for that guy.
2-2032	Hahaha, what indeed...?
2-2033	I'm not doing anything!\n...For the time being.
2-2034	Don't you have any faith in me?
2-2035	OK, on the double!
2-2037	Mission complete. Nice work.
2-2039	It sure would be terrible\nif we fell from here...
2-2040	I never thought I'd be standing\nin the heart of Agnus.
2-2041	So this is the famous Colony 4...
2-2042	It's brilliant! The sea forms\na natural defense.
2-2043	Oh, you can see Colony 11!\n...Nope, I lied. It's too high.
2-2044	It's been an age since I was here last.
2-2045	Ugh... Too cold for my blood.
2-2046	Mmm, that battlefield smell. Love it.
2-2047	This place is prime ambush territory.\nWatch out.
2-2048	Heh. There really is no place like home.
2-2049	Behold, the heroes' return! ...Or whatever.
2-2050	I wonder what would happen to us\nif there was a cave-in now.
2-2051	You want to keep going through here?\nAnd you call *me* weird.
2-2052	Hm? What's the tale with this path?
2-2053	Hey! Looks like a way through!
2-2054	Heheh! Booty's on the radar!
2-2055	What are we waitin' for?\nLet's get it open!
2-2056	Let's ask about.
2-2057	Peh. Gawkin' at me like they've never\nseen a Moebius before.
2-2058	Hm? Got a feelin' in my bones...
2-2059	And it's cryin' out for me to eat\nwhatever *that* is! Haha!
2-2060	Mm? Judgin' by the lay of the land...
2-2061	Heh. It's ether all right, pourin' out\nby the bucketload.
2-2062	Ah... Husks, are they?
2-2063	That looks like a job for you two.
2-2064	Ahh, there it is!
2-2067	Ha! I remember these floatin' islands.
2-2068	You reckon we might find the fruit old\nJaggar's gettin' around here?
2-2069	Ah! So this be the legendary fruit?!
2-2070	What a dull little island. There's nothin' here.
2-2071	Right me hearties, I'm gonna have\nto ask to see yer permits!
2-2072	Why are the monsters round here\nso bleedin' huge?
2-2073	Bet you'd get one hell of a rush\njumpin' off from the top.
2-2075	Nah, he just really loved to travel.\nBut by the flames was he a hoot!
2-2076	That's the spirit, lad!\nNow let's make for the hovering reefs!
2-2078	One little shipwreck wouldn't do them in.\nThey're made of sterner stuff than that!
2-2079	Pleased to be accompanying ye on\nthis little treasure hunt. I'm rarin' to go!
2-2080	The old fool... Dyin' on me without\nso much as a goodbye...
2-2081	Hold on, everyone...\nI'm on my way!
2-2082	Is this...?
2-2083	Irma...
2-2084	They're all here...!
2-2085	It's OK... I won't run again.
2-2086	I wonder...
2-2087	Looks like we can go this way too.
2-2088	Huh?
2-2089	I found something nice!
2-2090	Can we talk a bit?
2-2091	I'd never heard about this!
2-2092	Oh, that smells gorgeous!
2-2093	Shall we eat?
2-2094	Hey, an ether channel!
2-2095	Let's give it a try.
2-2096	Oh...
2-2097	...Can you send them on?
2-2098	Please! There's no time to spare!
2-2099	If only I was stronger...
2-2100	I don't want to lose them...
2-2101	I wonder what we'll find...
2-2102	I never knew this existed...
2-2103	I'm curious, but scared too...
2-2104	Wah... I'm getting so nervous...
2-2105	Time to fish!
2-2106	Lan-Lan, you're scaring them all away!
2-2107	Everyone will be so surprised!
2-2108	Stickers, stickers, stickers!
2-2109	Stickers... Got to get stickers...!
2-2110	This is perfect! Thank you Taion!
2-2111	I'm so glad we got here in time!
2-2112	Yep! Tussie always brightens\nup my day!
2-2113	Lan-Lan! Thank you so much\nfor the help!
2-2114	Right? Things you get from friends\nare always special...
2-2115	I hope we were able to cheer\nHildie up...
2-2116	Yeah, I'm glad we could talk it out...
2-2117	Yay, that's five stickers!
2-2118	Colony Mu is going down!
2-2119	I hope everyone'll be OK.
2-2120	Triton...
2-2121	OK, let's try somewhere else!
2-2122	But I was sure it was here...
2-2123	This time I'll definitely find it!
2-2124	Honorary Commander Clammoth,\nreporting for duty!
2-2125	Huh? It's all gone...
2-2126	Someone's tidied up...
2-2127	(sigh) Found you, Hildie!
2-2129	Look at the size of these mountains!
2-2130	It's all so green!
2-2131	I wonder how they built that...
2-2132	Levnises, everywhere I look!
2-2133	Ahh, it's lovely!
2-2134	The stones feel so good!
2-2135	Brrr... I'm not...c-cold...
2-2136	Easy... A step at a time...
2-2137	Would you look at that color!
2-2138	Imagine falling from here...
2-2139	The sand's all silky!
2-2140	I love the sea!
2-2141	The stars are beautiful...
2-2142	Flowers smell so nice!
2-2143	Did you miss me, Armu friends?
2-2144	I pon, you pon, we all pon for Nopon!
2-2145	Food for days!
2-2146	That is *one* waterfall!
2-2147	So many things I've never\nseen before...
2-2148	Ughhh... What if I get lost...?
2-2149	I'll take these petals back to the colony!
2-2150	It's so big, I'm almost dizzy...
2-2151	Think they'd be annoyed\nif we climbed up it?
2-2152	Beyond here.
2-2153	Request to gather around Ferron.
2-2154	Detecting a faint energy signature.
2-2155	Levnis wreckage. Assessment: site\nof attack correlates with the report.
2-2156	Thirteen!
2-2157	Ahh...
2-2158	Wait, please.
2-2159	Multiple heat sources detected.\nLifeforms are inside.
2-2160	Nav system activated.
2-2161	New path discovered.
2-2162	Sensor input detected.
2-2163	Supply cache discovered.
2-2164	Energy source secured.
2-2165	Report: ether channel discovered.
2-2166	Ah...!
2-2167	Husks. You will send them off?
2-2168	Environmental resistance field deployed.\nHazardous elements will be neutralized.
2-2169	Scanning for Colony 0's identification signal...\nWe are approaching the rendezvous point.
2-2170	Affirmative.
2-2171	Compliance.
2-2172	Yes.
2-2173	No. 13 will be ahead...
2-2174	Suggest infiltrating via an alternative\nroute.
2-2175	Facility infiltration: successful.
2-2176	Target article retrieved.
2-2177	Understood. Returning.
2-2178	Commencing operation.
2-2179	Subjugation target discovered.
2-2180	Hm...?
2-2181	Requesting to assist Nos. 9 and 3.
2-2182	No. 6 and No. 8 - requesting we\nsupport them.
2-2183	Helping No. 10 and others.
2-2184	I find mine...pleasing.
2-2185	Ferron maintenance environment\noptimized.
2-2186	Storage space enlarged to house\nfood supplies.
2-2187	Replenished essential supplies for\nFerron upkeep.
2-2188	Upon the unit's request, daily essentials\nhave now been distributed.
2-2189	All prison camp modifications\ncomplete.
2-2190	Dust filter engaged.\nExhaust apparatus secured.
2-2191	Water seepage detected...\nNo change to operational output.
2-2192	Oxygen levels and air pressure\ndropping.
2-2193	Volatile organic compounds detected.\nDanger to humans: negligible.
2-2194	This facility... It is a Ferronis\nproduction plant.
2-2195	Yes... You're correct.
2-2196	Um... It's good to be back.
2-2197	Unit No. 7 has arrived home.
2-2198	Hey, think I found us a path.
2-2199	Yeah, we can get through this way.
2-2200	What've we got here?
2-2201	Heh! Nice little find!
2-2202	I'll do some snooping around.
2-2203	Got some juicy morsels for ya!
2-2204	I think we can get some ether\n'round here.
2-2205	Here's some of the good stuff.
2-2206	Didn't expect to see fighting here.
2-2207	You gonna send 'em off?
2-2208	Ugh, I need feedin'...
2-2209	Hey, let's eat something here!
2-2218	Like hell you're gettin' away!
2-2219	Just eyeball the numbers, eh? Tirkins ain't\ngood enough at maths to tell the difference.
2-2221	I leave 'em alone for a second and\nnow this? Dammit!
2-2225	Tirkins here too? Why don't we\nhire 'em while we're at it?
2-2227	Hope I'm not too rusty!
2-2228	They're probably getting antsy\ncause I'm around.
2-2229	Sometimes you need a little\ncomfort food.
2-2232	Not exactly the world's finest grub,\nbut at least no one'll bother you.
2-2234	All right, ya dags! Get your\nInterlink on and give 'em hell!
2-2235	That path...
2-2236	We can get through here.
2-2237	Follow me.
2-2238	Which way, then? Your decision.
2-2239	A container.
2-2240	Be sure to raid it.
2-2241	This way.
2-2242	Found a container.
2-2243	Normally I avoid civilian contact, but...
2-2244	I've got some good intel.
2-2245	Just going to run recon\non the canteen...
2-2246	Nothing out of the ordinary.\nShould be safe to use.
2-2247	Got ourselves an ether channel\nnearby.
2-2248	Get it filled.
2-2249	That ether's really flowing.
2-2250	If you can use it, then use it.
2-2251	Husks, is it?
2-2252	Send them on.
2-2253	The Founders...
2-2254	They may have started the fight, but it's ours now.\nIt's about time we put an end to it.
2-2268	Hmph... I told you not to maunder on.\nGet going to Daedal Isle.
2-2269	The investigation comes later.\nFirst, back to the City.
2-2270	A doctor, a mechanic, and an old friend...
2-2271	Time we pooled our info.
2-2272	Be on the lookout for a hidden door.\nAnything that strikes you as odd.
2-2273	The head of one the Six Houses lives here.\nDon't embarrass yourselves.
2-2274	...Rest in peace.
2-2275	Heh. Colony folk are tougher\nthan I thought.
2-2276	This is where you and he...\nI see.
2-2277	Up ahead...
2-2278	Oh, look over there.
2-2279	Guess we can go this way too?
2-2280	Hey, come here!
2-2281	Ohoho, look what I've found!
2-2288	Oh...
2-2289	They're from Colony 9...\nNoah, will you do the honors?
2-2290	Let's go! I'll back you up!
2-2291	That should be everything\nRoald asked for.
2-2292	Let's tell Roald the good news.
2-2293	You don't know how glad I am to have\na great guy like you around, Noah.
2-2294	If we've got things to get off our chest, now\nwould be a good time to say them, huh?
2-2296	We shouldn't burn ourselves out. Let's avoid\nanyone who looks too strong, OK?
2-2297	Is that...Lenny?
2-2298	Noah, you don't wanna go any further.
2-2299	More friends lost...
2-2300	Lanz, you just focus on protecting\nNoah. Don't worry about me.
2-2301	I guess having the upper hand\ndoesn't guarantee your safety...
2-2306	We've been spotted...
2-2307	More enemies?! What do we do?
2-2308	Enemy reinforcements!
2-2309	New enemies. Be careful!
2-2310	Here comes trouble...!
2-2311	Ah! Get away!
2-2312	The Great Sword's come into view...
2-2313	But it's still a long way away...
2-2314	The Great Sword, majestic as ever.
2-2315	We must be getting closer...?
2-2316	We're almost there... Finally...
2-2317	You can see the Great Sword from here as well...
2-2318	It's still a ways off, though...
2-2319	The place of hope, like that man said...
2-2320	Look! The Great Sword in all its glory...
2-2321	If we can get through here, it'll just be a stone's throw away...
2-2322	The Great Sword... Talk about conspicuous.
2-2323	Are we getting any closer...?
3-1	It seems to be locked.
3-2	It doesn't seem to be responding.
5-3	It doesn't seem to be working.
6-1	We can't leave the\nengagement area!
6-3	Let's get our preparations in order\nbefore we leave, yeah?
6-4	Let's rest up nearby.\nWe have to wait for nighttime.
6-5	Um, we're mid-op here, remember?\nThe target is deep in Alfeto Valley.
6-6	This ain't the way to Colony 9,\nsurely?
6-7	It would be too dangerous to return\nto Colony Gamma right now. For\nnow, let's just get away from here.
6-8	We should see if there's\nanything we can use.
6-9	It's too dangerous to go back\nto our colonies. Let's head in\na different direction.
6-10	Right now, let's aim for that\nFerronis hulk.
6-11	Let's try out this new power\non some monsters!
6-12	Hey, that's not the way\nto Colony Omega!
6-13	We're not done here yet, are we?\nC'mon, let's head back to Omega.
6-14	We can't head out until we've gone\nover our Arts.
6-15	I think we're better off resting up at camp\nbefore we do anything else.
6-16	We need to try switching classes first.
6-17	We'd better retrieve the container's\ncontents before we move on.
6-18	Hang on, we need to help Manana out\nwith her cooking...
6-19	We need to try crafting a gem with Riku first.
6-20	We need to equip the gem we crafted first.
6-21	We can't afford to move on until we've\nstrengthened our Ouroboros powers.
6-22	Let's not proceed down\nthis route, hm?
6-23	Colony 4 is this way!\nWe gotta get away from here.
6-24	If we go outta the caves, we'll\njust get shelled. We'd better keep\npushing forward.
6-25	We shouldn't push ourselves.\nLet's rest somewhere nearby.
6-26	We shouldn't push ourselves.\nLet's rest somewhere nearby.
6-27	We should avoid going down\nthis route.
6-28	Let's not get too far off-track.
6-29	We should keep our distance from\nthe Castle until we're fully ready\nfor the infiltration.
6-30	The operation to infiltrate\nthe Castle is underway.\nWe can't back out now.
6-31	We need to take out the soldiers\nin this area first, then we can\nrendezvous with Ghondor.
6-32	I think we oughta wreak\nsome more havoc first.
6-33	This isn't the way\nto our destination.
6-34	Let's return to the Castle.\nWe have a job to do!
6-35	It would be wise to give him\na wide berth for now. We don't\nwant him catching on to us.
6-36	It would be wise to give him\na wide berth for now. We don't\nwant him catching on to us.
6-37	Let's get away from the Ferronis.\nThe plan requires us to circle\nbehind the Moebius and defeat him.
6-38	Weren't we gunning for the\ntransport on Pedesto Valley Floor?\nWell, that's not this way.
6-39	We'll get rumbled if we go this\nway. Get that transport checked.
6-40	Let's find Riku's treasure\nand then move on.
6-41	We can't move on until we've\ndefeated that Arachno with\nRiku and Manana.
6-42	We should head for\nColony Lambda first.
6-43	Must find Commander Isurd first...
6-44	Don't think we've got any\nbusiness here now, do we?\nC'mon, let's head back.
6-45	The road ahead's long.\nBetter rest up.
6-46	Manana was sounding hungry.\nLet's find a place nearby to rest.
6-47	We shouldn't forge ahead until\nwe've replenished our supplies.\nWon't last long on what we have.
6-48	First, we have to take the Colony 5\nfolks to a safe place.
6-50	We won't get away through here.\nQuick, let's jump into the water!
6-51	We have to get to Shania.
6-52	We should hear out Manana.\nLet's rest up at the camp.
6-53	Surely we oughta stay away from Colony 9...?\nAt least, unless we hear they're in trouble or\nsome other troubling "info" like that...
6-54	It'd be hard getting to Colony 9 through here.\nLet's head back through Alfeto Valley.
6-55	We have to sort out my equipment first.
6-56	Let's talk things over at the canteen.
6-57	We're not done here yet...\nThere's no running from this!
6-58	If we continue this way, we'll get spotted\nby Levnises for sure... Let's land on the\nother side of Corne Island instead.
6-59	We should have Riku and Manana\nwith us for this.
6-60	We should go and see Mio.

6-0	Agnus and Keves, working together as a team...
6-1	Taion seems a little dissatisfied, but at the time,\n*his* thinking was quite aligned with mine.
6-2	Finding a path that lets us all live...\nI will make that my mission.
6-3	We have endured the fierce fighting at Colony 4, and learned\nthat the Consuls and Moebius are one and the same.
6-4	Truths we took for granted continue to crumble at our feet...
6-5	We have spent so long blindly walking\nthe path set before us, without question.
6-6	But we are more curious now.\nOf our future selves...
6-7	Of our purpose...
6-8	We all have secrets, deep within...
6-9	Memories we can never erase...\nDifficult experiences...
6-10	It's just a distant dream of mine right now...
6-11	But if we can just reach out to each other,\neven a little, we can tease out those delicate shapes.
6-12	Then, with time, our bonds will grow stronger.\nUntil one day...
6-13	Time bears down on us without mercy.
6-14	How should we live the days that we have left?\nWhat should we spend them on?
6-15	We saw one possible answer to those questions.
6-16	But we cannot accept it.\nNot even as a last resort.
6-17	After all, it was the only path\nthat was offered to those two.
6-18	We should all be free to choose our own way.\nThat's our belief. That's why we fight...
6-19	N and M.\nAnother version of us...
6-20	What are we, really?\nWhy do we exist in the first place?
6-21	The answers are within me,\ntogether with her hopes and dreams.
6-22	I will give them a voice.
6-23	I will make him hear *our* truth...
6-24	As the morning sun rises,\nmy lingering memories fade.
6-25	I no longer see your silhouette.\nIt's too far gone into the haze.
6-26	But, hey... It's all right.
6-27	I won't forget you.\nNot until we can meet again...
6-28	I swear it.

33-45	Auto-Attack
33-46	You will automatically attack an enemy if you\napproach them. This is called an auto-attack.
33-47	Stand still near an enemy to continue auto-attacking.\nAn icon confirming you're in range for auto-attacks will\nbe shown in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
33-48	Destinations
33-49	An ! will mark your next destination. The number below\nit indicates how far away you are from the destination.
33-52	How to Begin a Battle
33-53	Begin a battle by drawing your weapon. First, target an\nenemy, then press [ML:icon icon=btn_a ] to draw your weapon. To withdraw\nfrom battle, hold [ML:icon icon=btn_a ] for a while to sheathe your weapon.
33-54	Approach an enemy to automatically target them. If there\nare multiple enemies, press [ML:icon icon=btn_l ] or [ML:icon icon=btn_r ] to target a different\nenemy.
33-55	Arts
33-56	Arts are stronger than auto-attacks. They can be\nactivated by pressing [ML:icon icon=btn_x ], [ML:icon icon=btn_y ] or [ML:icon icon=btn_b ].
33-57	After using an Art, you cannot use it again until\nits gauge fills back up. The Arts gauges fill up\nautomatically over time. This is called recharging.
33-58	Talent Arts
33-59	Talent Arts are stronger than normal Arts. A Talent Art\ncan be activated by pressing [ML:icon icon=btn_a ] once its circular gauge\nis full.
33-61	A Talent Art's gauge is recharged by performing actions\nexpected of a character's role, also called "Role Actions".
33-62	Noah's role in this battle is as an Attacker. Using Edge\nThrust from behind an enemy is what is expected of an\nAttacker, so doing so will recharge Noah's Talent Art.
33-63	Aggro
33-64	Accumulating aggro will draw an enemy's attention\ntoward you. Using strong attacks and healing Arts will\naccumulate a lot of aggro, so keep that in mind.
33-65	If an ally is under attack and at risk of becoming\nincapacitated, a good tactic is to accumulate aggro\ntoward yourself so they can continue fighting.
33-66	Targeting Lines
33-67	Targeting Lines 2
33-68	Targeting Lines 3
33-69	To show you which of your characters are being attacked\nby enemies, a red or blue thread will connect the enemy\nand the character they're attacking: the targeting line.
33-70	When the character is an Attacker or Healer, the line is red.\nUnlike Defenders, defense isn't their strong suit, so it's your\ncue to be careful.
33-71	A blue line indicates the enemy's target is a Defender.\nDefenders specialize in taking enemy attention and attacks,\nso they should do just fine in this situation.
33-72	Art Combos
33-73	Landing certain Arts one after another in a set order is\ncalled a combo. Only Arts with special status effects can\nstart a combo.
33-74	For example, an Art that inflicts Break followed by an\nArt that inflicts Topple will topple an enemy. A longer\ncombo is Break > Topple > Daze > Burst.
33-75	The Combo Gauge
33-76	The combo gauge will appear when you start a combo.\nPerforming the next attack in a combo before the gauge\nruns out will continue that combo.
33-81	Combos: Launch Attacks

10-2	Could you help the colony\nstrengthen its defenses?
10-3	You always gotta be prepared for\nunforeseen situations. Much obliged.
10-4	If you're curious, there seems to be\na place with lots of rare goods.
10-5	I appreciate you investigating.\nYou scored quite the find, eh?
10-6	I want to decorate the colony\nwith flowers from all over Aetia.
10-7	It'll be really nice if this cheers\npeople up, even a little.
10-8	Now we've got rockslides to deal\nwith... You got any good ideas?
10-9	No more getting caught between a\nrock and a hard place for us, eh!
10-10	I need these for repairing power\nframes.
10-11	The balance is all sorted out now.\nThanks for your help.
10-12	The Nopon speak of beautiful items\nfrom all across the world.
10-13	One day, I'll go see Aionios's\nbeauty with Camilla.
10-14	I'd like something that will improve\nmy tolerance of spicy foods.
10-15	Cheers! ...OK, spices! You aren't\ngonna stop me now!
10-16	Bring me all the seeds that will\ngrow in the Aetia region.
10-17	You have my thanks. Now our\ncrop fields will really flourish.
10-18	Harala need more parts for fixing\nLevnises! Please, someone send!
10-19	Thanks! Now to crack on with\nbacklog of maintenance!
10-20	Anita and the others got caught up\nin a nasty rockslide. I'm worried...
10-21	Their injuries may heal, but\ntheir trauma will still remain...
10-22	This is what I need you to get.\nThanks in advance.
10-23	Nice. These will come in handy!
10-24	I'd like to stock up on some more\nLevnis parts.
10-25	Eilis has never been too hot on\nsafe driving...
10-26	I'm thinking of making more of\nUrl's fertilizer.
10-27	This fertilizer is going to make\nmy potato yields even bigger!
10-28	Want parts for maintaining!
10-29	Friend is lifesaver! Will know to\ncall friend again for part collecting!
10-30	I want to show Camilla my\nappreciation for all her hard work.
10-31	It's good to show a bit of everyday\nappreciation, don't you think?
10-32	I want to leave my feelings...my\nwords, not just a document.
10-33	The days of obsession with war are\nover now, a thing of the past.
10-34	I want to put my experiences into\na book; let people know I was here.
10-35	Thanks so much. Good luck on\nyour adventure.
10-36	Is there some food that you can eat\neven when it's raw...?
10-37	Awesome! Now I can snack\nwhile I'm on the march!
10-38	Here's what needs collecting on my\nCollectopaedia Card!
10-39	I hope this'll help out with Laurea's\ncollecting efforts as well.
10-40	Get me all the ore you can gather\nfrom the Aetia region!
10-41	You're a big help! Your arms must\nbe dead from all that mining...
10-42	I want some fruit from the Aetia\nregion!
10-43	I wonder what fruits are like\nelsewhere in the world!
10-44	How about some mining and weight\ntraining at Melnath's Shoulder?
10-45	It's a great way to kill two birds\nwith one stone, ain't it?
10-46	Gogol is the brawniest!\nGogol is the strongest!
10-47	Eating this, I too will become\nthe brawniest and the strongest!
10-48	If I just had gemstones of the\nPentelas region...
10-49	The powder I'll grind out of these\nwill make for a fine sedative!
10-50	Give me some Aetia mushrooms\nto experiment on, please.
10-51	Now, time to test just how effective\nthis poison is...
10-52	I need some firewood for the cold\nnights on Melnath's Shoulder.
10-53	...Thanks.
10-54	You can harvest clams, even in the\nAetia region.
10-55	These clams are absolutely\npacked with great nutrition.
10-56	Could you help me procure some\nvegetables?
10-57	A balanced diet is just as crucial to\nbodybuilding as training is, after all.
10-58	If only I had some nectar for my\nsore throat...
10-59	This'll help me talk with no trouble\nin no time! Thank you very much!
10-60	Could you get me some parts to\nuse for Ferron maintenance?
10-61	Thanks a bunch. Now these guys\nwill be ready to go whenever.
10-62	No. 10 mentioned that there were\nrare types of flowers around here...
10-63	Wow, they're so pretty...\nThank you so much!
10-64	So, there's these rare fossils...\nNot that it matters, really...
10-65	I-I didn't really ask for your help!\nSo it's not like I'm thanking you!
10-66	I'm requesting some assistance with\nsurveying the Perimeter Woodland.
10-67	There's a limit to what results we\ncan achieve... Thanks for helping.
10-68	I love roasted seeds from the\nCadensia region.
10-69	You're as reliable as I thought! I'll\ncall you if I need anything again!
10-70	Do you know about Black\nBlossoms? I need some urgently.
10-71	Cheers for that! Those blossoms\nare gonna help me help my friends!
10-72	I need to have Fili become\nfriendlier with me, and fast.
10-73	Fili's always been a precious friend\nthrough thick and thin, after all.
10-74	So, I heard about these rare stones\nand fossils you find in the desert...
10-75	I'm not sure if this is the real deal\nor not...but it's intriguing, anyway.
10-76	Meh-meh! Veggie supply lacking!
10-77	With plentiful veggie, now all\nfriend can have balance in diet!
10-78	Cooking go chilly too quick when\noutside.
10-79	Now that meals snug and toasty,\nfur cozy and warm!
10-80	A hot day calls for super-juicy\nveggies to cool down with.
10-81	The heat ain't gonna beat me now!

10-195	He he... I really owe you one...
10-196	You couldn't help me make...let's\nsay, some traps, could you?

10-217	I see now... It's like a new world is\nopening up before my very eyes.
10-218	There's this lumber that's in the\nHovering Reefs. Can you get it?
10-219	It's a shame that I couldn't get\nthe stuff for myself, alone.

10-235	I think I'll give this shell as a\npresent to Brenda.
10-236	Have you got any fossils from the\nPentelas region?
10-237	Amazing! I've never seen any of\nthese creatures before.
10-238	There should be fossils even at the\nGreat Sword, shouldn't there?
10-239	I've never seen these fossils before.\nThey could even be treasure!

10-271	How utterly fascinating. It's like\nit's from another world entirely...

10-275	You're a real pal. Now I can drink\nthis medicine without throwing up.
10-276	I wonder if monsters can be\ncontrolled with the foods they like?
10-277	Right, let's see if this'll work then.
