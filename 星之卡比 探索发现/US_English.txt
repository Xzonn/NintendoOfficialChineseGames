Figure.msbt
KirbyNormal	Kirby was pulled into a mysterious vortex that\nappeared in the sky over his home on Planet\nPopstar. When he woke up, he was in a new\nworld! Traveling through that vortex also gave\nKirby a new and mysterious power... Let's see\nwhat it can do! Onward to adventure!
SupportChara	A mystical new friend you met in a mysterious\nnew world. You found Elfilin as he was trying\nto save the Waddle Dees from the Beast Pack.\nHe seems happy to be Kirby's guide, sharing\nhelpful advice to save the Waddle Dees and\nrebuild their town. Thanks, Elfilin!
BandanaWaddleDee	Bandana Waddle Dee was pulled through the\nvortex along with Kirby. When he heard that\nhis fellow Waddle Dees were being captured\nby the Beast Pack, he grabbed his trusty\nspear and ran to help! He can join you as P2\nwhile you explore the new world.
WaddleDee	These Dee-lightful residents of Planet Popstar\nlanded in the new world before Kirby arrived.\nThings looked grim when wild beasts began to\ncapture them and steal their precious food...\nbut with Kirby's help, they're rebuilding their\ntown and starting over!
KirbySword	Slice through this new world as a sword-\nwielding, green-hatted hero! Try charging up\nbefore you swing for extra power. Train hard,\nand become this world's new sword master!
KirbyBomb	Hold down the button to aim and throw.\nGot it? Hold, aim, throw! Throw, hit, BOOM!\nYou can run and throw them too, or roll them\nahead of you to get an explosive strike!
KirbyCutter	Swish! Sling that sharp-edged boomerang!\nUse it to grab far-off items. Hold the button\ndown to freeze it in midair and charge it up.\nThat will make it extra powerful! Swish!
KirbyFire	This ability is hot, hot, hot! Light fuses, burn\nthrough obstacles, and toast your enemies\nwith the power of a raging fire. Run, jump,\nthen attack to blast forward as a fireball!
KirbyRanger	Time for some shooting-star sharpshooting!\nPew, pew! Hold the button down to charge\nand aim, then let go to send a sparkling shot\nflying. Charge it up for bigger blasts!
KirbyNeedle	Ouch! Ooch! Careful with those spikes! Jab\nenemies in place, or pick 'em up by rolling\naround. Nab a whole bunch of 'em together,\nthen launch them off all at once! POW!
KirbyIce	Brrr! So cold! Can you see your own breath?\nMake a chunk of ice, then kick it forward!\nSkate and slide wherever you go. You'll\neven glide right over mud and magma!
DeformKirbyCar	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire car into his mouth!\nWhen he does, he turns into a peppy, pink car\nthat can jump and use Turbo Dash. It's a nice\nday for a scenic drive. Turn up the radio!
DeformKirbyCone	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire cone into his\nmouth! Use your pointy head to jab below\nyou and bust open cracks in the ground or\non pipes. You're out of cone-trol, Kirby!
DeformKirbyWaterTank	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire dome into his\nmouth! Wrap around one of these, then twist\nuntil it pops open. Think there's anything\ngood inside? Only one way to find out!
DeformKirbyLocker	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire set of lockers into\nhis mouth! Wiggle and thrash until you tip\nover... Hey! Who put this behind the lockers?
DeformKirbyLockerBig	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire set of lockers into\nhis mouth! This one won't budge. Wiggle,\nwiggle, wiggle, and— Whoa! He just took a\nwhole chunk of that wall down! Use this to\nfind hidden routes you didn't know about.
CaptiveCage	One of the Waddle Dees being held captive by\nthe fearsome Beast Pack. There are so many\nout there waiting to be saved. You can\nalmost hear them calling for help... "Wa-wa!\nWa-wa!" Let me out, let me out! Wait, you\nhear that too? One of them must be nearby!
GoalPoint	The Beast Pack managed to catch these three\nWaddle Dees with one golden cage! If they\nwork together, they might be able to... Oh.\nNever mind. They're too sad to move. All they\ncan do is cry out for help. "Wa-wa, wa-wa!"\nSomebody save them!
AnimalWaddleDee	A common beast that can be found all over\nthe new world. They're pretty cute, but they\nhave a dangerous wild side. They'll growl and\njump at anyone who crosses them! A whole\nbunch of these critters attacked the Waddle\nDees. Funny, you'd think they'd get along!
RabbitEnemy	The little one? That's Rabiroo. The big one?\nThat's Orabiroo. The O is for, "OH my gosh,\nlook at how high they can jump!" Try not to\nbe under one when they land. Their fellow\ncritters like to pet them because they're so\nfluffy. (Don't touch the tail. They hate that.)
TackleEnemy	Behold! It's the brutal, brutish Buffahorn!\nWeak attacks won't stand a chance against\nthis critter's forward tackle. Good thing they\nhave a hard time stopping! If you're careful,\nyou can trick them into running off cliffs.\nThey'll be OK down there. They're real tough.
Turtle	Tortorner has a whole shell made of concrete,\nas if it walked off with somebody's sidewalk!\nIt has a thick skull and a mean bite, but its\nbody is pretty delicate. A Mouthful Mode\nability might help you crack through its shell\nand land a brutal blow from above!
TurtleBig	Whoa! Tortuilding's shell is a whole building!\nThis big baddie must be some kind of boss\nfor the smaller beasts. It enjoys basking in\nthe sun, so it climbs to high spots and claims\nthe whole area as its territory. (It must take a\nlong time for this critter to get up there...)
RangerEnemy	This uppity pup is an expert marksman—pew,\npew—who's quick on his feet as he patrols\nthe new world. His eyes are hidden under his\nhat, but that doesn't seem to affect his aim!\nHe also has an impressive sniffer that can\ntrack prey, near or far.
NeedleEnemy	Charge those points up, then...zing! Let 'em\nfly! Jabhog is famous in the new world for its\nspiky spines. They were short and cute when\nit was young, but they eventually grew into\ndangerous needles. It'll jab anything that gets\ntoo close, so approach with caution!
CarshopSignboard	This logo belonged to an auto shop named\nHoline Custom Autos—part of Holine Corp.\nHoline also sold industrial parts, managed\nconstruction, and made all kinds of stuff.\nFrom buildings to streets to amusement-park\nrides, remember: if it's quality, it's Holine!\nErr, perhaps "it was" would be more accurate.
MallEntrance	This was the logo for Alivel Mall, owned by\nAlivel Holding Company. "Making life even\nlivelier" was their corporate slogan. They ran\na wide range of businesses: entertainment\narenas, food shops, service industries...\nNow the remains of those businesses can be\nfound in all kinds of places, empty and alone.
CompanyBoard	The Lightron Works Company was a massive\ncorporation that invested in research and\ndevelopment within all kinds of fields: electro,\nbio, astro, and more! Lightron eventually split\nup, giving rise to many rival companies and\ncountless heated corporate battles.
MaxTomato	If your health is low, just eat a Maxim Tomato\nto fully heal yourself. (They're packed with\nnutrients!) Did these fall through the same\nvortex as Kirby and his friends, or were they\nin the new world already? It's hard to tell,\nbut everyone seems to enjoy them—even the\nBeast Pack!
TownCafeJob	Kirby's taken on a side gig at the counter of\nthe Waddle Dee Café! He's dressed like a\nfocused employee, but he's secretly fighting\nthe urge to gobble up each dish himself.\nThis might be his greatest struggle yet...\nStay strong, Kirby!
TownFishing	Ahhh. Kirby's doing a bit of fishin' at the ol'\nfishin' pond. He looks super, super relaxed...\nMaybe too relaxed. Hey! Pay attention, Kirby!\nThere's exciting stuff swimming in that pond,\nincluding the legendary "Bling Blipper" of\nWaddle Dee Town!
TownKnow	When you need wisdom, visit Wise Waddle\nDee! He always has a tip handy and seems to\nknow a lot about this new world. His magical\nencyclopedia can collect and share rankings\nfrom all over the world! (Where did he even\nfind that book?!)
TownDeliveryservice	This dutiful delivery Dee works for Waddle\nDee-liveries in town. He gets helpful items to\nyour doorstep with blinding speed! Kirby's\nhandwriting makes it hard to read the Present\nCodes sometimes, but this kind soul approves\nthe orders anyway.
TownFoodShop	This short-order cook loves to feed his fellow\nWaddle Dees at the café in town. He even\nkept them fed after they crashed in the new\nworld! His cooking smelled so good...which is\nhow the Beast Pack found them. Now that the\ncafé has been rebuilt, it's time to get to work!
TownTamakoro	Step right up, step right up! This Waddle Dee\nruns the town's favorite game, Tilt-and-Roll\nKirby. The other Waddle Dees love to play his\ngame. In fact, they wouldn't stop asking him\nfor more! That might explain why he added\nthe daunting Extra Hard difficulty.
TownToolShop	This enterprising Waddle Dee opened his own\nitem shop in town. He sells special items that\nwill help you out. He also supplies the café\nwith an Energy Drink that he makes by hand.\nThey have a special business arrangement:\ntwo Energy Drinks for three Kirby Burgers!
MisterFrosty	The mysterious vortex brought Mr. Frosty to\nthe new world too! He arrived shortly before\nKirby and immediately joined the Beast Pack.\n(The change in wardrobe must have made it\nan easy choice.) It's tough to be the new guy,\nbut his fellow beasts love working with him.
BossGorilla	Gorimondo considers the local shopping mall\nto be his personal territory. As part of the\nBeast Pack's executive council, he's in charge\nof capturing Waddle Dees and gathering food.\nHe tends to eat all the fruit himself... He just\ncan't help it! This behavior has earned him\nan earful from his boss more than once.
KirbyDrill	Burrow underground with your mighty drill!\nYou can use this to dodge enemy attacks.\nIf you dig in certain spots, you might be able\nto sneak into off-limits areas! Heh heh...
KirbyTornado	Pull enemies, blocks, and stars into your\ncyclone, then release them to deal damage!\nThis ability's controls might make you dizzy,\nso whirl, swirl, and twirl...but try not to hurl.
KirbyHammer	A sturdy hammer with intense attack power.\nYour reach is short, but it's worth it to bonk\nenemies—and stakes! Hold the button to\ncharge, then let go to do a Hammer Flip!
KirbyCrash	DANGER! DANGER! This ability makes the\nbiggest boom of all, and you can hold the\nbutton down to make it even biggest-er!\nNothing will escape that blast. BWOOOSH!
KirbyEliteRanger	The most experienced of marksmen requires\nthe fanciest of hats. Fire a barrage of shots\nwith dual-wielded pop guns. You can release\na flurry of charged shots too! P-pew, p-pew!
KirbySwordGalactic	This big ol' sword is definitely gigant...ic!\nIt's a bit hard to swing around, but it'll keep\nyou well guarded. Use it to shield yourself\nfrom an attack, then go on the offensive!
KirbyBombChain	Chain your bombs together to explode all of\nthem at once! Hold the button down, aim,\nand throw to place them. The more bombs\nyou connect, the more damage they'll do!
KirbyCutterChakram	You can dual wield cutters?! Whoa! Sling\nboth chakrams forward to slash a wide area\nin front of you. It's fun to watch 'em fly...\nas long as you're doing the throwing.
KirbyFireVolcano	BOOM! FWOOSH! This volcano's erupting!\nHarness the power of geothermal energy to\nspew lava in front of you. Blaze through\nenemies and make 'em feel the heat!
KirbyNeedleJunk	Pointy, spiky clutter all rolled up into a ball?\nIt's needles upon needles! What a powerful\nweapon! Roll forward, then release to send\nsharp clutter flying out around you. OUCH!
Swan	Grace, elegance, beauty...and brutal attacks.\nPull your enemies into a flurry of feathers,\nand turn battles into sophisticated ballets.\nOw! Hurts almost as much as pointe shoes...
KirbyHammerToy	Sure, this may be the cutest bonk to ever\nbonk a bonk...but this is no plaything! It has\nrapid, continuous attacks with enough power\nto hammer stakes and crush enemies.
KirbyCrashTime	We didn't think the Crash ability's boom\ncould get any biggest-er...but this one can\nbreak time itself! Slow down time, then act\nfast to cause some real destruction!
DeformKirbyRing	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire metal ring into his\nmouth! Huff and puff out blasts of air to blow\nsand away, defeat enemies, or spin windmills!
DeformKirbyRingBoat	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire metal ring into his\nmouth and use it for boating! Use blasts of\nair to move your boat and slam into enemies.\nYou can even bust through cracked walls!
DeformKirbyLightbulb	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire light bulb into his\nmouth! Illuminate your surroundings with the\nglow from your gullet. It's hard to move when\nyou're lit up, so study your surroundings, go\ndark again, and wobble onward—carefully!
DeformKirbyRollerCoaster	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire roller coaster into\nhis mouth! Zip along the rails, and tilt left or\nright to dodge. Everybody strap in, because\nthe Spaceship Wondaria is blasting into the\nfuture! Wheee!
Alligator	This robust swimmer has a powerful jaw.\nIt floats on the water's surface, watching and\nwaiting for its prey. Its hide is as tough as\narmor, so you'll need something bigger than\na Copy Ability to take him down... Do you\nthink Mouthful Mode would do the trick?
WaterBigEnemy	Balloon-Meister loves to do tricks! No one\nknows where it learned 'em. Perhaps it's\nhereditary? Whatever it is, the tricks are fun!\nJust don't let the ball touch you. Try to inhale\nit instead to get the Bomb Ability. (Hey, wait!\nWhere did it get that ball?!)
DrillEnemy	For Digguh, moving through the ground is as\neasy as swimming. It just dives underground,\nthen...wiggle, wiggle, jump! SURPRISE! You\nnever know when to expect Digguh... Kinda\nrude, actually. It'll also throw clumps of dirt\nat you and munch on ground-bound meals.
HammerEnemy	What a happy little ape! Smile and dance,\nMookie. Watch him swing and throw his little\nhammer around... You can tell he's happy to\nsee you. Just look at that smile! Huh? That's\nnot a smile? He's trying to scare us?! Well,\nuh...it's working now! Yikes!
ParkEntranceStatue	Wondaria was named after its founder, an\nauthor who wrote stories about a dog that\nexplores outer space. Those stories became\nincredibly popular and were later used as the\nbasis for the Wondaria theme park—a land of\ndreams for kids of all ages!
ParkMascot	Wondaria's founder based the park's most\npopular characters on their own two dogs,\nWondog and Wondy. These two friends travel\nthrough the cosmos together in their stories,\nworking as a team and having all kinds of\nwild adventures!
Bonkers	The mysterious vortex brought Bonkers to\nthe new world too! They arrived before Kirby\nand quickly joined the ranks of the fearsome\nBeast Pack. They really like their new look,\nand they're getting along with all of their new\ncoworkers...especially the Mookies!
MbossTornado	Fleurina always puts on an elegant show\nwhen she attacks. Don't get too caught up\nin her performance, or you'll get caught up in\nher tornado to match! She's very dedicated to\nher dance career and thinks of every battle\nas a new lesson. (They keep her on her toes.)
GigantEdge	The mysterious vortex brought Gigant Edge to\nthe new world too! They arrived before Kirby\nand fell in with the ranks of the Beast Pack.\nDespite the wild wardrobe change, they really\nstand out among the rest of the pack, but\nthey'll still guard their stations with ferocity!
WhispyPalm	Fresh ocean air and warm sunlight helped\nTropic Woods grow big and strong. Its giant\ncoconuts will cause big explosions after they\ndrop. It has nonexploding coconuts too, and\nthey're supposed to be delicious! Few have\never tasted them...but many have tried.
BossLeopard	Clawroline tried to cut your adventure short\nat the Wondaria circus. She normally acts as\na point of contact for the Beast Pack's boss,\nbut she couldn't resist the chance to track\nKirby down herself. Her grace and speed are\nquite impressive, so the rest of the pack think\nof her as an idol. She has lots of fans!
KirbySleep	Zzz... Just one more minute, please... Zzz...\nOh, c'mon... I'm too sleepy... Zzz... Just let\nme recover some health with a bit of rest...\nZzz... Zzz... Zzzzz...
KirbyPencilDrill	This drill evolution is mighty and graphite-y!\nIt's not ideal for writing, but you can use it\nto launch out of the ground and shoot out\npencil rockets. Now that's the write stuff!
KirbyFrostyIce	Frosty Ice gives you chilling powers...and a\nreally cute hat! Blow out freezing blasts of\nair and create a line of snowmen. Aww, they\nall have Frosty's face! He must be so proud.
KirbyFireDragon	Become a legendary monster with the power\nof a dragon! Spew fire like a flamethrower.\nJump, attack, and glide through the sky.\nYou can do all sorts of dragon-y stuff!
DeformKirbyVendingMachine	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire vending machine\ninto his mouth! Fire soda cans forward to\nattack enemies and blast through barriers.\nYour ammo is limited, so keep an eye out for\nany cans that can be picked back up!
DeformKirbyStairs	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire set of scaffold\nstairs into his mouth! Move the stairs around\nto access hard-to-reach spots. You can also\ntip yourself over to crush enemies. Wham!
DeformKirbyCylinder	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire pipe into his\nmouth! Get a good forward roll going, and\nnothing can stop you...assuming you time\nyour jumps over gaps well, that is.
DeformKirbyElevator	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire scissor lift into\nhis mouth! Raise and lower yourself to reach\nitems and dodge enemy attacks. You can also\nspit the lift out while extended to reach the\ntop of tall platforms!
DeformKirbyWaterBalloon	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff a huge amount of water into\nhis mouth! Fill yourself up at a water pipe,\nwobble over to a patch of muck, and spray\nit away to clear a path forward. Thanks for\ncleaning up!
DeformKirbyGlider	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire metal arch into his\nmouth! This form turns you into a graceful\nglider that soars on the wind. Steer through\ntight spaces, and use your Spin Tackle to\nswat away enemies. Enjoy your flight!
CaptiveSupportChara	Elfilin was captured by King Dedede after the\nbattle at Winter Horns. His cheerful advice,\nonce so common and helpful, was replaced\nwith heavy silence. Don't be sad, Kirby...
NormalEnemyWild	Originull Wasteland is the birthplace of the\nBeast Pack, so it's no wonder the Awoofies\nfound there are more wild than their far-off\ncousins. They're more aggressive in every\nway, from their bark to their bite. Their primal\nancestors must be pleased!
SnakeEnemy	This ravenous reptile can swallow its enemies\nwhole! Once it spots prey, it'll slither after it\nas swift as it can. Some of the things it tries\nto swallow seem unreasonably large, but its\nstretchy body allows it to gulp them down.\nWait...why does that sound familiar?
PoisonToadEnemy	Poison Croakom is a giant frog covered in\nicky, sticky poison. The gunk covering its\nbody protects it from all attacks, but a quick\nsplash of water will wash it clean to reveal a\nbeautiful (and vulnerable) blue hide! It must\nhave a great skin-care routine...
Blueprint	These precious paper plans will show you\nhow to upgrade your Copy Abilities! Kirby\ncan't do much with them on his own, but the\nWaddle Dee in the weapons shop can use\nthem to dink-donk-bonk each ability to be\neven more powerful. What a skilled engineer!
Metaknight	The mysterious vortex brought Meta Knight to\nthe new world too! He quickly tasked himself\nwith finding a way back to Popstar...until the\nBeast Pack attacked Waddle Dee Town. The\nbesieged settlement needed protecting, and a\nswordsman never ignores a chance to train!
Dedede	King Dedede arrived in the new world shortly\nbefore Kirby and his friends! It looked like he\njoined forces with the Beast Pack, but that's\nno excuse for his mistreatment of the Waddle\nDees! His iconic gown seems to have been\naltered to match his newfound allegiance...\nand he seems way, way stronger somehow!
BossArmadillo	Sillydillo is an incredible dancer...as long as\nthe dance involves spinning. It's a nocturnal\ncritter, so it can see quite well in the dark.\nIt seems to have orders from its boss to find\nsomething important, but all it brings home\nis junk! What was it supposed to find again?\nSomething...small? And floaty? Hmm...
KirbySwordMeta	The Meta Knight Sword has a bunch of cool\nattacks—just like its namesake! Sword Slide,\njump, and attack to use Upper Calibur. With\nfull health, you'll even sling Crescent Shots!
KirbyHammerRock	This hefty hammer is made from super-tough\nstone! It's too heavy for quick hits, but each\npowerful swing will deal explosive damage.\nYou'll even crack the ground itself!
KirbyCutterMetal	What's the buzz, cuz? This Cutter evolution\nhas increased power and flying distance.\nIt'll also ricochet off walls, so aim carefully\nto send it extra far! Clink, clank, BUZZZZZ!
KirbyNeedleCrystal	Ooh, how pretty...ouch! And sharp! Release\nthe button while rolling to launch spiky\ncrystals in front of you. You'll also roll\nlonger and leave spikes in your wake!
KirbyBombChainSearch	Toss a homing bomb, then watch it get to\nwork! It'll patrol the area until it spots an\nenemy, then race toward them and explode.\nChain bombs together to corner your foes!
KirbyDrillTwin	Unleash brutal attacks with double the drill\npower! Your speed and damage are both\nincreased, and you can attack enemies\nabove you while still burrowing below!
KirbyIceBlizzard	Don a beautiful tiara of ice, and become a\nfrigid force of nature! Use this ability to\nskate around enemies, then stop them cold\nwith a volley of foe-freezing icicles. Brrr!
KirbyDeep	Mmm... Zzz... Walk to...bed...and get all...\ncuddly cozy... Zzz... You'll show everyone...\nyour full potential...after you wake up...\nZzz... Zzz... Zzzzz...
KirbyStorm	Ominous clouds! Powerful winds! This scary\nstorm roars to life with the press of a button.\nPull enemies into your cyclone by swirling\ninto them, then attack with lightning!
KirbySpace	Blast off, Space Ranger! Fire laser beams\nfrom your trusty laser gun. If a fully charged\nshot hits an enemy, they'll be caught in a\nflurry of sparks and take extra damage!
KirbyDedede	The self-proclaimed king's hard-hitting\nhammers are now yours! Let the power of\nthe mask take over to unleash devastating\nattacks with a fiery flourish!
KirbyMorpho	Before the final battle, a fluttering fiend\narrives to cast its judgment. This dangerous\nweapon grants that form to any who wield it.\nFor Kirby, handling this power is...a breeze.
DeformKirbyDumpCar	To save two worlds, Kirby's final mouthful\nmust be his biggest! It looks like a lot to\nhandle, but he seems totally fine somehow.\nGo, Kirby! Carry your and Elfilin's combined\nhope for the future! Race through the sky\nand deliver the final blow!
TurtleBigLava	The aggressive boss of all Tortuildings dwells\nwithin the Forbidden Zone of Redgar. When\nthis hothead finds a suitably sweltering spot,\nit stays put. It's reckless with its attacks,\nshooting chunks of concrete out of its mouth\nto hit faraway enemies.
NormalEnemySleep	The Beast Pack lives among the remnants of a\ncivilization that left this world far behind.\nThey may not know how to use everything\nthey find, but they always enjoy the simple\npleasures...like the scent of pine that lingers\non this Awoofy's favorite napping spot!
TreasureHunt	The new world is filled with danger...and\ntemptation. Any unexpected detour during\nyour adventure could lead to a mountain of\ntreasure. How many other surprises are\nhiding out there? There's only one way to\nfind out!
KirbyAndMetaknight	Meta Knight arrived in the new world shortly\nbefore Kirby. He did some early scouting and\nreached as far as the snowy north before\ndeciding to return and protect the town.\nNow he keeps watch for beastly invaders from\nhis perch by the Colosseum. He's battled\nGorimondo 30 times—and won every bout!
KirbyAndDedede	"Planet Popstar's destined rivals!" That's how\nKing Dedede usually describes this special\nrelationship, so he was crestfallen when he\narrived in the new world and couldn't find\nKirby. By the time they finally met, Dedede\nhad changed from friendly rival to menace!
ClearDance	Bandana Waddle Dee and Elfilin have joined\nKirby's victory dance! Kirby's dancing is cute\nand carefree, but his singing voice is super\npowerful. Let's all sing along with him next\ntime! Woo-hoo! Great job, Kirby!
ChallengeAllClear	It's not clear how or why the space called\n"Treasure Road" started to appear behind\nportals throughout the new world. A strong\nenergy was felt from within, and Rare Stones\nwere soon discovered as its source.\nCongratulations on collecting all of them!
TownAbilityRoom	This energetic craftsman opened his own\nweapons shop in town. He can power up your\nCopy Abilities! All he needs is a blueprint, his\ntrusty hammer, and a little elbow grease. He\nkeeps making the headgear for each evolved\nability bigger than the one before. That's how\nyou know they're more powerful!
TownArena	The Colosseum is always ready for battles\nwith brutal beasts, but no one was prepared\nwhen a mysterious vortex opened inside the\narena! Commentator Waddle Dee was so\nscared that he almost shut everything down,\nbut his curiosity won in the end. What wild\nbattles await within? It's tournament time!
TownTheaterRoom	After the town was destroyed, this movie-\nloving Waddle Dee decided that the cinema\nneeded to be rebuilt right away. Sure, food\nand shelter are important, but so are movies!\nAs for his favorite movie, it probably has to\nbe...all of them!
TownLive	It's the local four-Dee band, the Deedly Dees!\nThey love to jam in front of a crowd and start\neach request off with a "Wa-WA!" (Let's GO!)\nBand meetings at the café can get heated due\nto their different musical tastes, but when the\ntunes kick in, they fall perfectly in sync.
BossLeopardAndSoul	The soul fragments collected by Kirby and\nClawroline have been returned to their owner.\nLeongar—now restored as Leon—is free of\nID-F86's corrupting mind control. This world\nis in good paws once again!
BossLionAndLeopard	These two were the famous leaders of the\nanimal kingdom...until Leon found ID-F86.\nAfter that, he began speaking in a language\nCarol couldn't understand—she only speaks\nin meows—and formed the brutal Beast Pack.\nShe still believed in him, so she formed a new\nidentity of her own and followed along.
MaskDedede	The foul fiend standing guard at the bottom\nof Redgar Volcano was...King Dedede again?!\nHe calmed back down after you removed his\nmenacing mask. So why did he kidnap Elfilin?\nHe said he was being controlled, even before\nsome strange beast put that mask on him!
BossLion	Here sits the powerful commander of the\nferocious Beast Pack. He's become a pawn\nfor an invading specimen from beyond the\nstars, tasked with gathering food, capturing\nthe Waddle Dees to use as a power source,\nand—most importantly—retrieving the lost\nsubspecimen tagged as ID-F87...
BossOrigin	When ID-F86 arrived, it began attacking all of\nthe native wildlife. The creature was captured\nsoon after and turned into a test subject.\nThe native inhabitants used it to create tech\nbeyond their wildest dreams. They eventually\nused that tech to leave the planet altogether,\nbut ID-F86 remained, forgotten and fractured.
BossChimera	The invading species, alone and incomplete\nwithout Elfilin, was trapped in the Eternal\nCapsule. Their only refuge was the realm of\ntheir dreams. Those dreams spread powerful\nwaves of psychic energy all over the world,\nslowly taking control of the animals they\nreached. Escape would require more energy...
BossChimeraPerfect	The Elfilin we first met was born from a small,\ncompassionate soul that hid behind greater,\ninvasive ambitions. Without a soul to temper\nits power, the creature's spatial-teleportation\nability ran amok, opening mysterious vortices\nleft and right. Now that they're whole again,\nthey're already planning their next invasion...
SoulSingle	After their fight with Kirby, ID-F86's body was\ndestroyed, but their powerful mind survived.\nThey fled to the isolated isles of their own\ndreams...and brought Leongar with them.\nTo prepare this new vessel, they cast out\nLeongar's soul, shattering and scattering it\nthroughout the realm of Forgo Dreams.
BossGorillaEX	This illusory beast was created with powerful\npsychic energy in a realm of dreams. It's not\nthe real Gorimondo—just a phantom made of\nnegative thoughts—but it's still incredibly\nstrong! Since it's based on memories of the\nreal Gorimondo, it can't resist a fruity snack.
WhispyPalmEX	This phantom in the form of Tropic Woods\nhas grown mysteriously strong under the\nillusory sunlight of Forgo Dreams. Do you\nthink its coconuts are illusions too? Wonder\nwhat they taste like...
BossLeopardEX	The real Clawroline asked Kirby to help her\nsave Leongar. This phantom feline is a fake!\nFormed from negative thoughts and powerful\npsychic energy, this wild beast doesn't seem\nto care about Leongar at all. She may be an\nillusion, but her claws will cause real damage!
DededeEX	This Dedede double is made of powerful\npsychic energy. It's an illusion of the king\nbased on memories of his embarrassing turn\nunder ID-F86's control, forced to work for\nLeongar and capture Elfilin. It has no memory\nof Kirby or the adventures they've shared...\nIt's little more than a haughty, hollow husk.
BossArmadilloEX	Formed from strong psychic energy and\nmodeled on specific memories of his role in\nthe real world, this phantom copy of Sillydillo\nwill forever wander Forgo Dreams, searching\nhigh and low for Elfilin and Kirby... At least\nits dance moves are still impressive!
MetaknightEX	The lone illusory foe that you encountered\noutside of Forgo Dreams. When Fecto Forgo\ntried to control Meta Knight like it had King\nDedede, the experienced swordsman came\nout on top through sheer force of will...but\nthe result was this mysterious doppelgänger,\nformed by the residual psychic energy!
MaskDededeEX	Forgo Dedede was formed when Leongar gave\nthe already-controlled king a mask to further\ncloud his mind. He was then tasked with\nguarding the only entrance to Lab Discovera.\nThis phantom copy, based on memories of his\nterrifying turn, is somehow even stronger and\nmore dangerous than the original!
BossLionAndOrigin	The specimen tagged as ID-F86, left formless\nand floating after a humiliating defeat, fled to\nForgo Dreams to plot their next steps: create\na new army of phantom beasts, then claim\nLeongar's body as their own. When Kirby\narrived to force them out, ID-F86 had no\nchoice but to reveal their own phantom form.
MorphoKnight	The fluttering fiend that casts judgment upon\nfinal battles is drawn toward the isolated isles\nof Forgo Dreams. There, it feasts on the most\npowerful soul it finds and takes the fearsome\nform of a scarlet-clad knight... Let the most\nchallenging battle of this new world begin!
BossChimeraSoul	A unique convergence of elements, from\nnative-beast souls to ethereal butterfly, gave\na stubborn soul one last chance at revenge.\nThis new creation, driven by pure chaos, was\ndefeated by the bright light of Kirby's hope.\nThe last bit of life that remained willingly\nreturned to Elfilin. At last, two became one.

Msg_BossLion_DemoAppear_00	{[1a00|03cd]}{[1400]}Take a good look, pink intruder... Isn't this a\nbeautiful sight?
Msg_BossLion_DemoAppear_01	{[1400]}You're not even seeing the Great One in full form.\nThey're incomplete without their {color[ff4d2fff]}other half{color[000000ff]}.{[0004]}{[1400]}Long ago, the Great One granted the people of this\nworld a {color[ff4d2fff]}miraculous power{color[000000ff]}...{[0004]}{[1400]}Those people left this world behind...and entered\na land of dreams.
Msg_BossLion_DemoAppear_02	{[1400]}Once the Great One is complete again...{[0004]}{[1400]}I know we will also receive this miraculous power.\nWe, the ones they left behind in this {color[ff4d2fff]}forgotten land{color[000000ff]}.{[0004]}{[1400]}And now...the time has finally come!
Msg_BossLion_DemoAppear_03	{[1a02|03cd]}That's right. This small creature here...is the\nGreat One's missing half!{[0004]}Finally, after all our planning and effort, we can\nhelp the Great One reach their {color[ff4d2fff]}complete form{color[000000ff]}.
Msg_BossLion_DemoAppear_04	{[1a00|04cd]}We've dreamed of this moment for so many years...\nIf you dare to stand in our way...
Msg_BossLion_DemoAppear_05	{[1a03|00cd]}\n\n{[1801]}{color[ff4d2fff]}{size[b400]}{[1500|3000]}We'll feast on your hide!{size[6400]}{color[000000ff]}{[1802]}
Msg_BossChimera_DemoAppear_00	You... You dare...

Msg_BossChimera_DemoAppear_02	\n\n{size[8200]}{[1500|3a00]}EVERYTHING. SHALL BE. CONSUMED.{size[6400]}
Msg_BossChimeraPerfect_DemoDisappear_00	{[1902|01cd]}Such incredible power! Whatever it's trying to do,\nit's going to be pretty bad...
Msg_BossChimeraPerfect_DemoDisappear_01	What is it, Kirby?
Msg_BossChimeraPerfect_DemoDisappear_02	Whoa! Is that...{[0004]}Is that your home? That's {color[ff4d2fff]}Planet Popstar{color[000000ff]}?!
Msg_BossChimeraPerfect_DemoDisappear_03	Oh no! It's pulling Popstar through that huge vortex!\nIt wants your world to {color[ff4d2fff]}collide{color[000000ff]} with this one!
Msg_BossChimeraPerfect_DemoDisappear_04	{[1907|01cd]}We have to stop it! But how?!
Msg_TownStreetLiveGiveFigure	{[1401]}{[1901|03cd]}Oh my gosh! Look, Kirby! The Deedly Dees gave us a\n{color[ff4d2fff]}special figure{color[000000ff]} to thank us for supporting them!
Msg_VassalWaddleDee_GetBlueprint_00	{[1401]}Hiya, Kirby! Been a while, hasn't it? I didn't get to\nsay it before, so...thanks for saving King Dedede.{[0004]}{[1404]}Speaking of, he seems to really like this town!\nHe's been resting to help himself heal.
Msg_VassalWaddleDee_GetBlueprint_01	{[1800]}Actually,{[1401]} we have something to give you...\nit's a {color[ff4d2fff]}blueprint from King Dedede{color[000000ff]}!{[0004]}A gift! From the king! What an honor!
Msg_VassalWaddleDee_Talk1	The way our daring king threw me into that elevator\nafter I tripped...and made sure to protect me...{[0004]}{[1401]}I was just in awe! He's usually so carefree, perhaps\na teeny-tiny bit lazy...{[0004]}But when it matters most, our leader always does his\nroyal duty. Long live King Dedede!
Msg_VassalWaddleDee_Talk2	His Majesty seems to be enjoying life in this town.\nGuess we'll be sticking around for a while!
Msg_VassalWaddleDee_Talk3	His Majesty is acting cool and aloof, like he\nalways does, but...{[0004]}{[1402]}He's actually pretty upset that you were saving us\nwhile he was, uh, being controlled like a puppet.{[0004]}{size[4b00]}You should probably give him some space for a while. Sorryyy...\n\n{size[6400]}
Msg_MerchantWaddleDee_WelcomeFirst	Hiya, Kirby! Listen, you're collecting Gotcha Machine\nfigures, right? I've been admiring your collection.
Msg_MerchantWaddleDee_Welcome	I just used a Gotcha Machine...and it gave me a\nfigure that you don't have!
Msg_MerchantWaddleDee_AskExchange	So...would you care to {color[ff4d2fff]}trade{color[000000ff]} {color[ff4d2fff]}one of your {[0101|8100]} Rare\nStones{color[000000ff]} for my Gotcha Machine figure, Kirby?
Msg_MerchantWaddleDee_WelcomeTradeAllGet	What?! You already got ALL of the figures that are\ncurrently available? That's amazing!
Msg_MerchantWaddleDee_WelcomeComplete	Whoa! You already have a complete collection of\nfigures? Like, every single one?! That's amazing!
Msg_MerchantWaddleDee_AskExchangeComplete	Well, all the same...would you like to trade my figure\nfor {color[ff4d2fff]}one of your {[0101|8100]} Rare Stones{color[000000ff]} anyway?
Msg_MerchantWaddleDee_EndTrade	If you ever have a {[0101|8100]} Rare Stone to spare...and feel\nlike collecting more figures...{[0004]}Well, I'll be here! I'm always ready to trade.
Msg_MerchantWaddleDee_RarePieseShortage	Oh! Sorry. You {color[ff4d2fff]}don't have enough{color[000000ff]} {[0101|8100]} Rare Stones...
Msg_MerchantWaddleDee_CancelTrade	If you ever feel like collecting more figures,\nI'm always ready to trade!
Msg_TownSupportChara_UnlockEstory1	{[1907|01cd]}Hey, look! Clawroline is visiting our town! She looks\na bit upset... Hmm...
Msg_TownSupportChara_UnlockEstory2	{[1905|05cd]}Ah! Are you thinking what I'm thinking, Kirby?{[0004]}When things finally calmed down and the animals\ncame to celebrate with us...Leongar was missing.{[0004]}I bet Clawroline has been looking for him...{[0004]}She might have found something! We should ask her\nwhat's going on.
Msg_TownSupportTalk_Estory_00	{[1904|03cd]}When I severed the connection between our two\nworlds, I used up all of my power. I blacked out...{[0004]}But Clawroline found me. She kept me alive!{[0004]}{[1900|00cd]}That's how I was able to see you again, Kirby.\nSo...if she needs help, then I volunteer!
Msg_TownSupportChara_DemoEstoryFirst	{[1908|00cd]}Is this...another mysterious vortex?!{[0004]}What? You sense Leongar somewhere in there?
Msg_EstoryWmapSupportChara_DemoFirst_00	{[1906|02cd]}Oh my gosh...{[0004]}{[1908|00cd]}This feeling! This is exactly how it felt when I was\nabsorbed by my other half, {color[ff4d2fff]}Fecto Elfilis{color[000000ff]}!{[0004]}It's possible that, after that big battle, Leongar\nbecame {color[ff4d2fff]}trapped in this strange place{color[000000ff]}...{[0004]}{[1901|00cd]}C'mon, Kirby! We have to check it out!
Msg_TownSupport_TalkLeopardFirst_00	{[1903|00cd]}Sorry we disappeared on you, Clawroline!{[0004]}The space through that tiny vortex is so weird!\nIt's made from powerful psychic energy.{[0004]}{[1901|00cd]}I think I've been in that place before... It felt just like\ngetting absorbed by my other half!
Msg_TownSupport_TalkLeopardFirst_01	Leongar must be stuck in that mysterious space\nsomewhere...{[0004]}{[1900|00cd]}We'll keep looking for him in there, OK? Just hold on\na little bit longer!{[1400]}
Msg_TownSupport_TalkLeopardBeforeClear	{[1901|01cd]}Don't worry! I'm sure we'll find Leongar in there...{[0004]}{[1907|00cd]}Once he returns, your pack will finally have its old\nleader back. Just hang on a bit longer!{[1400]}
Msg_TownSupport_TalkLeopardAfterClear_00	{[1900|00cd]}I'm really glad we were able to find Leongar—oops,\nI mean Leon—and bring him back!{[0004]}I haven't forgotten, y'know. When I used up all my\npowers to close the connection between worlds...
Msg_TownSupport_TalkLeopardAfterClear_01	You saved me, Clawroline. You kept me alive and\nmade sure I'd be able to see Kirby again!{[0004]}{[1907|01cd]}You helped me when I needed it, and we helped you\nin return. Now we can all be friends together!{[1400]}
Msg_TownSupportTalk_CentralSquare_00	{[1402]}{[1902|00cd]}When the Waddle Dees were first being captured,\nI thought I would end up all alone again...{[0004]}But then I met you, Kirby. And you worked so hard\nto save everyone and rebuild this town...{[0004]}{[1401]}{[1900|02cd]}Thank you, Kirby. Thank you so much!
Msg_TownSupportTalk_Common3_00	{[1402]}{[1904|03cd]}Say... What do you think the Beast Pack wants the\nWaddle Dees for anyway?{[0004]}I had just gotten to know all of them when the pack\narrived and started capturing everyone.{[0004]}We're far from the beasts' territory, so we thought\nbuilding a town here would keep us safe...{[0004]}Thank goodness you came along, Kirby!
Msg_TownSupportTalk_Common3_01	{[1905|05cd]}The Waddle Dees work really hard. I can't believe\nthey rebuilt this town so quickly!
Msg_TownSupportTalk_Common3_02	{[1904|04cd]}The Waddle Dees told me they used to live in the\nsame place as you! Did you know each other there?{[0004]}{[1403]}{[1908|00cd]}...{[0004]}Huh.{[0004]}{[1404]}So THAT'S how you all knew each other before you\ncame here? I never would have guessed!{[0004]}I bet that kept things interesting. I'm kinda jealous!
Msg_TownSupportTalk_PresentCode1_00	{[1905|02cd]}Hey, Kirby! I think there's a Present Code back here!\n"{color[ff4d2fff]}{[031f]}{color[000000ff]}"\nMaybe it's a thank-you gift from the Waddle Dees?
Msg_TownSupportTalk_PresentCode2_00	{[1905|00cd]}Ooh! There's a strange message in this pamphlet...\n"{color[ff4d2fff]}{[031f]}{color[000000ff]}"\nThis must be the hidden Present Code!
Msg_TownSupportTalk_PresentCode3_00	{[1905|01cd]}Something is written on this wall! Let's see...\n"{color[ff4d2fff]}{[031f]}{color[000000ff]}"\nIs this a hidden Present Code?
Msg_TownSupportTalk_PresentCode4_00	{[1905|03cd]}Huh? There's something written here...\n"{color[ff4d2fff]}{[031f]}{color[000000ff]}"\nIs this a hidden Present Code?
Msg_TownSupportTalk_PresentCode5_00	{[1905|04cd]}Hey, look at this! There's a code hidden here...\n"{color[ff4d2fff]}{[031f]}{color[000000ff]}"\nIs this a hidden Present Code?
Msg_TownSupportTalk_PresentCode6_00	{[1905|05cd]}Have you wondered why the Beast Pack stopped\nattacking and left this town alone?{[0004]}You certainly helped when you arrived, Kirby, but...{[0004]}The Waddle Dees told me that Meta Knight has been\nfighting to protect the town all on his own!{[0004]}He keeps watch day and night... He's even doing it\nright now from that perch up there!{[0004]}{[1401]}{[1900|00cd]}Gosh, Meta Knight is so strong...and so cool!
Msg_TownSupportTalk_PresentCode6_01	{[1905|01cd]}Something is written on this wall...\n"{color[ff4d2fff]}{[031f]}{color[000000ff]}"\nIs this a hidden Present Code?
Msg_TownSupportTalk_Common2_00	{[1905|05cd]}If you keep doing amazing things, you might get\nenough {color[ff4d2fff]}special photos {color[000000ff]}to cover this whole wall!
Msg_TownSupportTalk_Common2_01	{[1909|02cd]}Look, Kirby! That photo was taken when the whole\nBeast Pack came to say hello.{[0004]}Let's make a bunch of unforgettable memories and\nfill this whole wall with photos!
Msg_TownSupportTalk_Common2_02	{[1402]}{[1902|00cd]}When we heard Leongar had gone missing, I wasn't\nsure what we should do...{[0004]}I'm so glad we managed to save him!{[0004]}{[1401]}{[1900|02cd]}Now that everyone is safe, I hope we can make all\nkinds of unforgettable memories together!
Msg_TownSupportTalk_Common2_03	{[1907|01cd]}To decorate your house with figures, just open up\nyour collection with {color[ff4d2fff]}{[0412|9500]}{color[000000ff]}...{[0004]}Then select the figure you want, and press {color[ff4d2fff]}{[0411|9400]} {color[000000ff]}to\ndisplay it!
Msg_TownSupportTalk_Common2_04	{[1900|02cd]}If you take a nap in your bed, you'll recover all of\nyour health.
Msg_TownSupportTalk_Common2_05_01	{[1401]}{[1900|03cd]}Gosh, Kirby! I'm glad you like talking to me so much.{[0004]}Say...I never told you about what happened here\nbefore you arrived, did I?{[0004]}In the past, all the animals of this world lived in\npeace and harmony—kinda like we are now!{[0004]}I mean, we fought every now and then, but...
Msg_TownSupportTalk_Common2_05_02	We all tried to share our food and work together.\nThings were really nice!{[0004]}Then one day...a big, scary figure calling himself\nLeongar rose to power.{[0004]}Under his rule, everyone started going wild!{[0004]}I got pretty scared, so I went into hiding for a long\ntime...until the Waddle Dees started appearing!
Msg_TownSupportTalk_Common2_05_03	They were lost and afraid, so I wanted to help them.\nWe eventually decided a town would keep us safe!{[0004]}The first few buildings had just gone up when the\nanimals—now called the Beast Pack—found us.{[0004]}We fought as hard as we could, but in the end, the\ntown was destroyed...and everyone got captured...{[0004]}That's when you dropped in, Kirby!
Msg_TownSupportTalk_Common2_05_04	Thank you so much for saving me back then.\nI'm so glad I met you...{[0004]}I hope we can go on another adventure someday!{[0004]}My power to create vortices isn't very strong,\nbut I can open one to Planet Popstar anytime.{[0004]}So no matter what the future holds...\n{[1401]}{[1907|01cd]}I hope we'll always stay friends, Kirby!
Msg_TownSupportTalk_StreetLive_00	{[1401]}{[1907|03cd]}Wow! They built a corner stage! Looks like that\nband is named the {color[ff4d2fff]}Deedly Dees{color[000000ff]}.{[0004]}Can we stop and listen? Maybe they'll play requests\nif we toss {color[ff4d2fff]}{[0100|8000]}{color[000000ff]} {color[ff4d2fff]}Star Coins{color[000000ff]} into their {color[ff4d2fff]}guitar case{color[000000ff]}...
