The Boost Ball can be used in these areas to reach higher places. \n\nBuild a charge during descent in the half-pipe, then trigger the Boost while ascending the other side. This gives the speed and momentum necessary to reach new heights.\n
[500EC6A0]_SpiderBallDescription	The {color[89d6ffff]}Spider Ball{color[000000ff]} allows you to move the Morph Ball along magnetic rails.\n\nPress and hold {[0100|0ccd]} to activate the Spider Ball ability.\n \n{color[89d6ffff]}Samus's Notes:{color[000000ff]}\nFollow the magnetic rails to explore new areas.\n\nThe Morph Ball Bomb can be used to trigger a Bomb Jump while attached to a rail.\n\n\n

This is called a{color[89d6ffff]} Bomb Jump{color[000000ff]}. \n\nWhen a Morph Ball Bomb explodes, it must be close to the enemy to be effective.\n\nThe Morph Ball Bomb can break items made of{color[89d6ffff]} Sandstone{color[000000ff]} or{color[89d6ffff]} Talloric Alloy{color[000000ff]}.\n
[500EC6A0]_PowerBombDescription	The {color[89d6ffff]}Power Bomb{color[000000ff]} is the strongest Morph Ball weapon.\n\nPress {[0100|06cd]} when in Morph Ball mode to drop a Power Bomb.  \n\n{color[89d6ffff]}Samus's Notes:{color[000000ff]}\nPower Bombs do not have unlimited ammo. Use them wisely.\n\nThe Power Bomb can destroy many materials, including {color[89d6ffff]}Bendezium{color[000000ff]}.\n\nEach Power Bomb Expansion found will increase the number of Power Bombs it's possible to carry by 1.\n
[500EC6A0]_ChargeBeamDescription	The {color[89d6ffff]}Charge Beam{color[000000ff]} allows you to increase the damage and effectiveness of the Arm Cannon.\n\nPress and hold {[0100|30cd]} to charge the Arm Cannon, then release {[0100|30cd]} to fire.\n\n{color[89d6ffff]}Samus's Notes:{color[000000ff]}\nThe Charge Beam has a limited 'tractor beam' capacity.  Use it to pull small objects in.\n\nThere are Charge Combo enhancements scattered through the environment.  They use the Charge Beam and the Missile Launcher in tandem to fire more effective blasts.\n\nThe Charge Beam increases the performance of each Arm Cannon mode.\n
[500EC6A0]_BeamComboDescription	The {color[89d6ffff]}Charge Combos{color[000000ff]} allow you to fire the Missile Launcher and Arm Cannon together. The combined attacks are stronger than normal blasts.\n\nThe Arm Cannon must be charged to use a Charge Combo.\n\nWhen your Arm Cannon is charged, press {[0100|06cd]} to fire the Charge Combo.\n\n{color[89d6ffff]}Samus's Notes:{color[000000ff]}\nThe {color[89d6ffff]}Single Shot{color[000000ff]} Charge Combos fire one blast at a time. Each shot uses a number of Missiles.\n\n{color[89d6ffff]}Sustained Fire{color[000000ff]} Charge Combos will fire as long as the Missile supply lasts. Hold {[0100|30cd]} down after firing. It takes 10 Missiles to trigger these Charge Combos, then 5 Missiles per second afterward.\n\nPage down for information on the individual Charge Combos. \n\nThis data will download to the Log Book after each Charge Combo is acquired. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
