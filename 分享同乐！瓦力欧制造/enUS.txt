Nintendo_OP1_00	Rad! Did you see that? That was\nso scary...and SO AWESOME!
Nintendo_OP1_01	Huh?! What's wrong with my level?\nIs it broken?
Nintendo_OP1_02	Totally! There's these bugs in the\ngame, and they're chewing it all up!
Nintendo_OP1_03	OK then, let's go get 'em.\nNobody messes with my games!
Nintendo_ED0_01	Haha! Talk about a KO!
Remix1_OP0_00	A mine cart! That's more like it.
Remix1_OP0_01	We can cover a lot of ground\nin that.
Remix1_OP0_02	La-la-la-laaa! The acoustics in\nthere are perfect for karaoke.
Remix1_OP1_00	Mike! There you are! I'm not letting\nyou out of my sight again. You're coming with us.
Remix1_OP1_01	Fine. If I must.
Remix1_OP1_02	Too bad. There goes my\nsolo career.
Remix1_ED1_01	Good. We survived.
Remix1_ED1_02	Sing it!
Ikimono_OP0_00	Hyaaa! Hyaaa!
Ikimono_OP0_01	Hey! We found you!
Ikimono_OP0_02	What's with all the bouncing?\nYou look like a couple of tiny kangaroos!
Ikimono_OP0_03	We can't help it! Our legs\nwon't stop jumping!
Ikimono_OP0_04	Ha! It's probably just our suuuuper\nawesome ninja powers!
Ikimono_OP1_00	Listen up! Something really weird\njumped into our level!
Ikimono_OP1_01	You can help us take it down...\nif you're not too scared.
Ikimono_ED0_01	We did it! Mission complete!
Sport_OP0_00	What's with this place?\nIt's so dark and boring.
Sport_OP0_01	It is rather s-s-spooky!
Sport_OP0_02	Ha. Ha. Dr. Crygor is afraid\nof the dark.
Sport_OP0_03	I am not! My superior intellect\nis incapable of such an irrational fear.
Sport_OP0_04	Hello? Is anyone there?
Sport_OP0_05	WAAAAAH!!!
Sport_OP0_06	Good grief. Your superior intellect\nis a scaredy-cat.
Sport_OP0_07	Oh YEAH!
Sport_OP1_00	Aw, my dance floor...
Sport_OP1_01	We can fix it, but we gotta take\nout those rotten game bugs!
Sport_OP1_02	Alright! Game bugs don't stand a\nchance against my dance moves.
Sport_ED0_01	Ha HA! That was groovy!
Tabemono_OP0_00	I say! The corruption is particularly\npervasive here.
Tabemono_OP0_01	Aha! Ashley! I should have known.
Tabemono_OP0_02	Oh joy. And here I was\nfinally having some fun.
Tabemono_OP1_00	It's time to stomp some game bugs.\nAnd you! You're gonna help us!
Tabemono_OP1_01	Why should I?
Tabemono_OP1_02	Because I said so! And because...\nBah! Fine! We don't need you anyway!
Tabemono_OP1_03	Please. Of course you do.
Tabemono_ED0_01	Whatever.
Culture_OP0_00	What's that weird sound?
Culture_OP0_01	Oooh, I'm scared!
Culture_OP0_02	Wah! You nincompoop!\nWhat are you doing?!
Culture_OP0_03	Oops! The bad is mine.
Culture_OP1_00	My beam of tractoring...\nIt does not work on this glitchy yuck!
Culture_OP1_01	This stuff won't go away until we\ntake out those mean ol' game bugs.
Culture_OP1_02	I see! Then Orbulon will dispose of\nthese bugs...with style!
Culture_ED0_01	First I conquer the game bugs!\nThen I conquer THE WORLD!
Remix2_OP0_00	Ah-ha, another mine cart!\nI call driver's seat!
Remix2_OP0_01	Huh? Is something in there?
Remix2_OP0_03	Uh, I have a bad feeling about this.\nForget the mine cart. Let's go this way instead.
Remix2_OP0_04	Grrrr! 9-Volt!
Remix2_OP0_05	Aaaah! Mom!
Remix2_OP0_06	Unacceptable! You know better than\nto wander off by yourself! It's not safe!
Remix2_OP0_07	Oh my...getting upset...\nmakes me so...sleepy...
Remix2_OP0_08	So, like, what's up with your mom...\nand, uh, your other mom?
Remix2_OP0_09	She has these...out-of-body\nexperiences, I guess.
Remix2_OP0_10	Your mom's got spooky moves, eh?\nThat's weird. I dig it!
Remix2_OP1_00	Onwards and upwards!\nThere's no time to lose!
Remix2_ED0_00	My, my, wasn't that fun!
WarioDX_OP0_00	OK! Now we're getting somewhere.\nThis is the last level I made!
WarioDX_OP0_01	Oh no! There is much corruption\nhere. A great amount of much!
WarioDX_OP0_02	Eh?! What is THAT?!
WarioDX_OP0_03	WAAAH!
WarioDX_OP0_04	It's taking over my game!\nWe've got to stop it!
WarioDX_OP0_05	That didn't look like any ordinary\ngame bug, ya dig? Stay on your toes!
WarioDX_ED0_00	OK! We've got you now!
WarioDX_ED0_02	Oh yeah! The glitches are\nfadin' away!
WarioDX_ED0_03	Hey! What on earth are we going\nto do with this giant bug?
WarioDX_ED0_04	Hmmm...I say we leave it alone.
WarioDX_ED0_05	It's grimy and stinky and messed\neverything up. Which makes it perfect for my level!
WarioDX_ED0_06	Ziiip zooorp!\n(Thank you!)
WarioDX_ED0_07	Yerg! Orbulon has feelings of\nconfusion and excitement!
WarioDX_ED0_08	I am the Supreme Developer.\nI watch over this game, you might say. 
WarioDX_ED0_09	I am the one who brought you here.\nYes, that was all me.
WarioDX_ED0_10	What?! Supreme who?! C'mon!\nEveryone knows Wario is number one!
WarioDX_ED0_11	The game bugs arrived, quite uninvited.\nI knew not what to do. So I brought you here. To help.
WarioDX_ED0_12	I thank you for tidying up their mess.\nDifficult work, I'm sure. Now, your home is right this way.
WarioDX_ED0_13	Haha! Time to shuffle on outta here!
WarioDX_ED0_14	Please, come back and play anytime.
WarioDX_ED0_15	OK, let's get outta here before I, uh,\nremember something I'm forgetting.
AllMix_OP0_00	You have returned. And so soon.\nWelcome.
AllMix_OP0_01	It seems some of our friends are\nstill stuck inside the game.
AllMix_OP0_02	THREE of our friends!\nYou gotta help us!
AllMix_OP0_03	Yes. Of course. I shall check...
AllMix_OP0_04	Mm, yes, strange. It appears they\nhave been captured by...something.
AllMix_OP0_05	Aw, c'mon! I thought we took\ncare of all the game bugs!
AllMix_OP0_06	This is not the work of a game bug.\nWait... Oh dear...
AllMix_OP0_07	One of your friends is nearby.
AllMix_OP0_08	Alright! Somethin' tells me they're\nin this tower. Time to boogie!
AllMix_OP1_00	SOMEONE! ANYONE!\nHEEEEELP!
AllMix_OP1_01	Red, what have you done now?
AllMix_OP1_02	Ashley! I knew you'd come\nto rescue little ol' me!
AllMix_OP2_00	Oh boy, am I glad to see you!\nThis big...thing...locked me up in here.
AllMix_OP2_01	Did you see where this\nbig thing went?
AllMix_OP2_02	OK, so... I'm pretty sure it took this\nelevator up to Floor {key[AllMix|Half]}.
AllMix_OP2_03	The time for action is now!\nTo the elevator!
AllMix_ED0_00	Wait!
AllMix_ED0_01	What the hexsaroonie?!\nThat thing jumped out the window...from FLOOR {key[AllMix|Half]}!
AllMix_ED0_02	It dropped something.
AllMix_ED0_03	{[0201|CD00]}You found a {color[#1DFFFF00]}Golden Beehive{/color}!
AllMix_ED0_04	Eh-hehehe! TREASURE!
AllMix_ED0_05	We must not lose focus.\nTime to rescue the other two!
AllMix_ED0_06	OK! Let's go find more treas—\nI mean, let's go find our friends!
AllMix_ED0_07	Yes! Time to fly to the next level!
HighSpeed_OP0_00	Master!
HighSpeed_OP0_01	Look at him! So calm despite being\ncaptured. That's Master for you.
HighSpeed_OP0_02	Bah! He got tired of waiting and\nfell asleep.
HighSpeed_OP1_00	I am most grateful for your\nassistance.
HighSpeed_OP1_01	Eh! Where'd that thing go?\nAnd did it have any treasure with it?
HighSpeed_OP1_02	Hmmm...yes... I sense our foe's\npresence coming from somewhere on Floor {key[HighSpeed|Half]}.
HighSpeed_OP1_03	OK! Floor {key[HighSpeed|Half]}, got it! Time to get a\nmove on!
HighSpeed_OP1_04	Oh brother. He sure is eager.
HighSpeed_ED0_00	More treasure! I knew it!
HighSpeed_ED0_01	{[0201|CD00]}You found a {color[#1DFFFF00]}Golden Toilet Paper Roll{/color}!
HighSpeed_ED0_02	Huh. That's some pretty weird treasure.
HighSpeed_ED0_03	AH HA HA! So what?!\nTreasure is treasure!
HighSpeed_ED0_04	Let's go! One of us remains captive.\nWe mustn't fail now!
DeadOrAlive_OP0_00	Oh! Cricket!
DeadOrAlive_OP0_01	You came to rescue me!\nYou are so, so, SOOO amazing!
DeadOrAlive_OP1_00	Good. Everyone is here.\nNow we must defeat our foe!
DeadOrAlive_OP1_01	Hey! Kid! Which way did that weird\nblobby thing go?
DeadOrAlive_OP1_02	Um...I think it took this elevator to\nFloor {key[DeadOrAlive|Half]}.
DeadOrAlive_OP1_03	No time to waste. Treasure awaits!\nI mean, we gotta take that guy down or whatever.
DeadOrAlive_ED0_00	Yes! THERE IT IS!
DeadOrAlive_ED0_01	{[0201|CD00]}You found a {color[#1DFFFF00]}Golden Holey Mug{/color}!
DeadOrAlive_ED0_02	What's this? "I dare you to put all\nthree treasures together."
DeadOrAlive_ED0_03	Eh-hehe! A dare?! Wario never\nturns down a dare. Let's do this!
DeadOrAlive_ED0_04	Huh? How are we supposed to\nput all this junk together?
DeadOrAlive_ED0_05	Hey! Crygor! Use that robo-noodle\nof yours and think of something!
DeadOrAlive_ED0_06	My intellect IS truly formidable,\nbut this...this is rather beyond even me.
DeadOrAlive_ED0_07	Ah! I've got it! Let's see if my\ngranddaughter Penny can be of assistance.
DeadOrAlive_ED0_09	I can't wait to see what\nhappens next!
Penny_OP0_00	Alright then, I'll give Penny a call.
Penny_ED0_00	Hi, everyone!\nSorry to keep you waiting.
Penny_ED0_01	Ah, so glad you're here!\nAllow me to explain...
Penny_ED0_02	I bet you want me to turn that\njunk into something awesome. I'm on it!
Penny_ED0_03	All done!
Penny_ED0_04	{[0201|CD00]}You earned a {color[#1DFFFF00]}Golden Watering Can{/color}!
Penny_ED1_00	Oh, wow! That beanstalk!\nIt's incredible!
Penny_ED1_01	{[0201|CD00]}The {color[#1DFFFF00]}Golden Watering Can{/color}\nhas fulfilled its...duty.
Penny_ED1_02	WAAHHHH!\nMy treasure! My beautiful treasure!
Penny_ED1_03	OK, time to start climbing!\nI bet there's something at the top!
BigPyoro_OP0_00	Arrrgh! We've been climbing this\nthing forever! There's nothing here!
BigPyoro_OP0_01	Oh! There it is!\nThat's the thing that kidnapped me!
BigPyoro_OP0_02	Does it have more treasure?!\nWAAAAIT! COME BACK!
BigPyoro_OP1_00	OK! Let's get it, once and for all!
BigPyoro_ED0_00	We've got you cornered!\nGive it up!
BigPyoro_ED0_01	Huh?\nIs that...Pyoro?
BigPyoro_ED0_02	What did you say?!
BigPyoro_ED0_03	I knew it! It's Pyoro, star of that\nsuper-popular game!
BigPyoro_ED0_04	Hey! What are YOU doing\nin OUR game?!
BigPyoro_ED0_05	Hmm, let's see. He says...\n"I just stopped by to play for a bit."
BigPyoro_ED0_06	And, uh, he wants to know...\n"Did you have a good time playing with me?"
BigPyoro_ED0_07	Gah!
BigPyoro_ED0_08	Good time! Bad time! Who cares?!\nWhere is the TREASURE?!
BigPyoro_ED0_09	C'mon! There has to be treasure!\nSome gold, maybe? Just a teensy bit?!
BigPyoro_ED0_10	You're kidding.
BigPyoro_ED0_11	NO! There's nothing at all?!\nBut...but...IT CAN'T END LIKE THIS!
BigPyoro_ED0_12	Perhaps this is the end you seek...\nTreasure not the gold but the journey it inspired.

PresentCommentary.wmbt
Present_001	This could belong to anyone.\nGross. Might make a good gift for\nthose who groom...TOO much.
Present_002	This fluffy seed floats away when\nyou blow on it. Makes adults feel\nlike kids. Effect on kids unknown.
Present_003	Enemy of housekeepers who don't\nown ladders. BFF of Halloween\nenthusiasts. Good work, spiders.
Present_004	Something happened here.\nSomething...delicious. Oh well.\nInto the compost it goes.
Present_005	Someone pulled this all the way off\nthe can. Some people collect these\nto make necklaces. Pretty weird.
Present_006	Great for playing Kick the Can, if\nyou're absolutely, undeniably THAT\nbored. Please recycle it afterward!
Present_007	You could use this for lots of stuff.\nTaking groceries to the car, taking\nthem out of the car... Lots of stuff.
Present_008	Out of all the hats you could wear\nwhile taking a shower, this is the\nleast stylish. Who would wear this?
Present_009	Looks like someone untied this\nwhile opening a gift, then kept\nit for later. How practical!
Present_010	Great for a snack. It takes a lot of\nwork to grow these nuts...but they\ntaste really, really good.
Present_011	It's soda flavored. Ooh—and it's\nthe kind that sparkles and fizzes on\nyour tongue. That's the best kind!
Present_012	Can't party without one of these!\nWell, you could probably try, but...\nno one wants to be at that party.
Present_013	Just an egg that's been boiled.\nIs that disappointing? Lower your\nexpectations a bit. Thank you.
Present_014	You might call it a green onion,\nand you know what? That's fine.\nYou do you.
Present_015	A stopper for blocking drains in\ntubs. Without one of these, you'd\nhave to bathe SUPER fast.
Present_016	A prop to hold above your head\nwhen you get a good idea. It also\nlights up, if you're into that.
Present_017	Some machine must be rattling\naround without this. Hand it to a\ntinkerer, or toss it in a junk drawer.
Present_018	What does it unlock? A treasure\nchest? A footlocker full of smelly\nsocks? The imagination reels...
Present_019	A cherished tool. Whatever your\ntroubles, if you have this handy,\neverything will work out in the end.
Present_020	Essential for good dental hygiene.\nYou could also use one to scrub\nfloors! Just...don't mix them up.
Present_021	Nutrient-rich cow juice in a cute\nlittle bottle. Don't drink too much\ntoo fast. Your tummy will thank you.
Present_022	Powerful flavor, powerful stench.\nMakes a stellar seasoning but\npacks quite a punch. Hwoof!
Present_023	A snack with appeal. Ugh. Sorry.
Present_024	It's some grapes! Everyone loves\ngrapes. You love grapes too, right?\nWell, either way...it's some grapes.
Present_025	One hundred percent pureed fruit.\nPerfect for those who love fruit\nflavors but hate using their teeth.
Present_026	It's a delicious-looking dumpling!\nSmells amazing. Mmm... Sorry,\nwhat were we talking about?
Present_027	As yummy as it is cold. Your taste\nbuds will love you. Your sensitive\nchompers won't. Sorry, teeth.
Present_028	The widely popular "pink with\nsprinkles" flavor. Worth waiting\nin line for...probably.
Present_029	A storage device from an ancient\ntime. Might contain some secrets...\nforbidden, teeny-tiny secrets.
Present_030	No bento box is complete without\none of these. Mostly cute. Sort of\ncreepy. All the way edible.
Present_031	A delightful, jiggly treat. It even\nhas whipped cream on top! One\nwobbly bite and bliss will be yours.
Present_032	A flower that can't NOT be tied to\nromance. Grip one in your teeth to\nlook dashing—just mind the thorns.
Present_033	The letter U but used for science.\nGreat for metal-based experiments\nor, more often, cartoon hijinks.
Present_034	A paper pugilist for rowdy youths.\nDrum on the table to engage your\nopponent! Weak to scissors.
Present_035	Someone, somewhere is unable\nto wash their hands without this.\nGood as a spare part, perhaps.
Present_036	A log-shaped delight packed with\nfruit and frosting. Goes very well\nwith tea.
Present_037	A big, honkin' burger for a big,\nhonkin' appetite. Go on—tear into\nit like no one's watching. Mmmm.
Present_038	Whoa! The cheese on top is extra\ngooey and delicious... So good!\nIs this from Mona Pizza?
Present_039	Broth, noodles, and happiness in\na bowl. Great as a midnight snack.\nIt's always midnight somewhere...
Present_040	An all-time classic dish celebrated\nfor its spiciness. It might give you\nrowdy guts, but it's soooo worth it.
Present_041	The king of the tub. A perfect little\ncompanion for animal lovers or\ndie-hard bath enthusiasts.
Present_042	Warm socks with Wario on them.\nHis face warps when you put them\non, but it still looks just like him.
Present_043	An incredible disguise that would\nfool anyone. Use them for daring\nheists...or to make people laugh.
Present_044	Push the thingy down to make air\nwhoosh out of the little tube hole.\nThat's called physics!
Present_045	It's...a regular plate. Nothing fancy.\nPerfect for anyone whose kids\ntend to break things...like plates.
Present_046	Covers one eye as you read letters\nout loud. Call it an "eye occluder"\nto hear people say, "Huh?"
Present_047	A respected periodical among\nfacial-hair aficionados. Use it to\nbrush up on 'stache fashion.
Present_048	Feels heavy. Could be stuffed with\ncoins and cash...but that widdle\nface is too cute to smash open.
Present_049	A prickly plant stuck mid-shrug.\nIt's OK, buddy. No one expects\nyou to have all the answers.
Present_050	An extra-chic design. Place them\nover your eyes to defeat the sun.\nYour move, space.
Present_051	A doll within a doll. Within a doll.\nWithin another doll. How many\ndolls are hiding in here?!
Present_052	Savory meat in its most ideal form.\nA perfect meal for boosting one's\nmartial-arts training.
Present_053	A pesky upstart who likes to ruin\nbowling scores. It kinda looks like\nan alien if you squint.
Present_054	A sporty, speckled ball that's fun\nto kick. You might call it a football,\nand hey—that's perfectly fine.
Present_055	Found rocketing between bruised,\nflailing sportsmen. An ideal gift for\nfans of both sports and flailing.
Present_056	Happy birthday! We're so glad\nyou're here.
Present_057	This Wario-branded treasure has\nmany uses other than covering\nmanholes. Such as...well, many!
Present_058	A must-have for super-classy folks.\nAll you need is some of those tiny\nsandwiches and teensy cakes.
Present_059	Mmm, nothing says decadence like\na smelly mushroom. You can smell\nit, can't you? CAN'T YOU?!
Present_060	A delicacy that pairs well with\ncelebrations. Sushi lovers can't\nget enough of this stuff.
Present_061	Stare at the marbling long enough\nand it'll start to look like art. A fave\nof foodies and pooches alike.
Present_062	These kicks are slick, and they fit\nyou perfectly. With these, no racing\ndream is out of reach.
Present_063	A pricey gadget for audiophiles.\nCan you hear the difference?\nPfft, of course you can.
Present_064	A boxing champ is nothing without\na pair of these. Sweat stains only\nincrease their value.
Present_065	The smell of the wood transports\nyou back in time. Why am I sniffing\na bat? Sheesh, don't be so judgy!
Present_066	Lift, and then lift again. Switch\nsides and repeat ad infinitum.\nSuch is the formula for greatness!
Present_067	Talk into it to sound like a robot.\nOh, it also cools the room, or\nwhatever.
Present_068	This is one profoundly pungent\nflower. A great decoration option\nfor those who hate company.
Present_069	An ancient device used in ancient\ntimes for communication. It flips\nclosed. What. Even.
Present_070	A machine that captures memories\non shiny memory paper. What is\nthis sorcery?!
Present_071	Just hold this and, blammo,\nyou're cool. Just like that.\nI think it also makes music.
Present_072	A sleek yet practical device.\nWhy walk when you can run?\nWhy run when you can bike?
Present_073	A compact, slim design for adults\nwho work on the go but hate\ncarrying heavy stuff.
Present_074	A tool that keeps doe-linquents at\narm's length. Terrifying for them.\nSoothing and zen-like for humans.
Present_075	This dress represents the dream of\nhappily ever after. Do not, I repeat,\nDO NOT spill on it.
Present_076	This instrument brings to mind\nmountaintops. Yodel-ay-hee-who\nwouldn't want in on this?
Present_077	That expression says it all. These\nthings are especially popular\nwith the ladies.
Present_078	This primo toilet is gentle on the\nbottom, though it may take some\ngetting used to.
Present_079	You can tune a piano, but you can't\ntuna fish. Until now! That's called\nbeating the system.
Present_080	It's a plant...right? Wait, it's staring\nat me. That's super not normal for\na plant.
Present_081	A statue of a buff and hunky Wario.\nIn other words, a statue of Wario.\nTear your eyes away...if you can.
Present_082	This thing is both useful and fun\nto drive. Hop in, and take a whirl\naround the countryside.
Present_083	Break this and it's over. What's\nover? You don't even want to\nknow. Just don't break it, OK?
Present_084	This exquisite piece is the only art\nyou or the world will ever need. If\nyou lack taste, the exit's that way.
Present_085	A card that can make all of your\nwishes come true. If you're not\novertly greedy, it's just a card.
Present_086	It's empty, so don't expect a\ngolden gosling or anything.\nIt is exceptionally round.
Present_087	A huge, bright-red jewel. Some\npeople find the way it twinkles\nrather enchanting.
Present_088	Slices through the waves like a\nknife through so much butter.\nLive it up, why don't you?
Present_089	This chopper is proper, but its\npropeller is sweller.
Present_090	It's called a crane because kids\ncrane their necks to get a gander.\nI didn't make that up, really.
Present_091	A real head turner. Great for folks\nwith a take-charge attitude.
Present_092	A toilet that is made of gold.\nEven your booty deserves the\nlife of luxury.
Present_093	Your very own office building.\nIf you want a whole floor dedicated\nto garlic, that's your call.
Present_094	A paradise for golfers. A gold mine\nfor landscapers. Just an empty\nfield for the rest of us.
Present_095	A lovely island full of plants and\nanimals and the like. For the\nperson who has everything.
Present_096	Maybe no one knows how famous\nyou are yet, but that doesn't mean\nyou can't party it up like a celeb.
Present_097	A jumbo jet for those with jumbo\ntravel needs. Steer clear if you're\nafraid of heights.
Present_098	GASP. It's a crime-fighting,\nsuper-duper robot friend!\nWho doesn't love these things?
Present_099	The latest and greatest in space\ntravel. The cosmos is your\npersonal playground with this.
Present_100	It's giant! Enormous! Ginormous,\neven! Don't run into it because,\nyou know, just don't.

Chara_Park_Explain_Wario	This video-game maker loves\ntreasure, money, and garlic.\nAnd money. What could possibly\ngo wrong?
Chara_Park_Explain_Cricket	This devoted student of the\nmartial arts diligently trains\nunder Master Mantis. He likes\nmeat dumplings. A lot.
Chara_Park_Explain_Eighteenvolt	This overgrown school kid has mad\nrapping and retro-gaming skills.\nHe loves to play with his pint-size\npal 9-Volt.
Chara_Park_Explain_Mona	Work, school, and some pesky pets\nkeep this adventurous high-school\nstudent very busy. She's also a big\nfan of Wario. Why? Who can say?
Chara_Park_Explain_Dribble	When this Diamond City cabby\ngets behind the wheel, he may be\ndriving across town...or across the\nfar reaches of space. His partner,\nSpitz, is always there to guide him.
Chara_Park_Explain_Spitz	This Diamond City cabby has taken\npassengers to some strange places\nin his time. But no matter where\nhe goes, this cool cat always looks\nout for his loyal partner, Dribble.
Chara_Park_Explain_Crygor	This genius scientist is so good at\nmaking mechanical marvels, he\nmade a cyborg out of himself.\nThese self-improvements have not\nsolved his terrible tummy troubles.
Chara_Park_Explain_Ninevolt	This skateboarding school kid is\nobsessed with Nintendo games\nand has some serious DJing and\nyo-yo skills. He loves hanging with\nhis pal 18-Volt and his "pet" Fronk.
Chara_Park_Explain_Mike	This karaoke robot created by\nDr. Crygor has a great love of\nsinging. He does not, however,\nhave great skills at singing. Little\nknown fact: He is quite the cook.
Chara_Park_Explain_Kat	She may be in kindergarten, but\nshe's also a ninja! Fearless and\nstrong willed, Kat loves to lead\nher twin sister, Ana, on all sorts\nof ninja adventures.
Chara_Park_Explain_Ana	Ana is the quieter, ever-so-slightly\nyounger half of the Kat & Ana ninja\nduo. But this kindergartner is\nalways happy to follow her twin sis,\nKat, into the fray.
Chara_Park_Explain_Jimmy	Whether he's hitting the dance\nfloor or the gym, this sports-lovin'\ndisco king has all the right moves.\nFave hobby: Checking his emails.
Chara_Park_Explain_Ashley	Dislikes: Cute stuff, expressing\nemotions, and unnecessary\nchitchat.\nLikes: Casting spells, eating, and\nhanging out with her sidekick, Red.
Chara_Park_Explain_Orbulon	This alien keeps insisting he's\ngoing to invade the planet...\nsomeday. He's certainly lived on\nEarth long enough to know a lot\nabout our culture.
Chara_Park_Explain_Fivewatt	Mother to 9-Volt, she's as sweet\nas can be...until she gets mad.\nHer out-of-body anger is positively\nshocking! Like her son, she's\nquite the gamer.
Chara_Park_Explain_Red	Sometimes he seems to be more\nscaredy-cat than demon. Still,\nRed takes good care of his fave\nwitch, Ashley, transforming into a\nbroom or wand at her command.
Chara_Park_Explain_Mantis	A master of martial arts and\nCricket's teacher, Mantis is\nsaid to be very strong...though\nno one has ever seen him fight.
Chara_Park_Explain_Lulu	This Luxeville kid is as pesky as she\nis plucky. She's an adoring fan of\nCricket (whether he likes it or not).
Chara_Park_Explain_Penny	This budding scientist and grand-\ndaughter to Dr. Crygor loves two\nthings most of all: inventing stuff\nand singing. She dreams of\nbecoming a pop sensation!
Chara_Park_Explain_Pyoro	The beak! The tongue! The legend!\nThe star of the hottest game in\nDiamond City—"Super Pyoro"—\ncouldn't resist making an\nappearance in Wario's game too.

Menu_Main_Menu_Lock	You cannot select this mode yet. You must experience the {color[#C313FF29]}Story{/color} first. Patience, player. Patience...
Menu_Main_Menu_Story	This is where {color[#49FFFFAF]}Wario{/color} and his crew begin their journey. Play through various levels to continue their adventure. Oh, yes—and if you hold {key[_BUTTON_Y_]}, you can {color[#60FFFF06]}fast-forward{/color} through any of the text that scrolls here. You are welcome.
Menu_Main_Menu_Variety	The games found here have rules that are a little different from those in the {color[#C313FF29]}Story{/color}. Try teaming up with others to conquer these games as a group. If you'd rather go it alone, there are also plenty of games to conquer by yourself.
Menu_Main_Menu_Collection	All of the games from the {color[#C313FF29]}Story{/color} can be found here. You will play a single game over and over, cycling through Levels 1-3 in order. Practice games you're not good at, or master the games that you like the most. Quite the handy feature, don't you think?
Menu_Main_Menu_WarioCup	In this mode, you will play games within a {color[#C313FF29]}Challenge{/color} set by Wario. New {color[#C313FF29]}Challenges{/color} will be added each week. If you earn a good score or time, you'll win yourself a splendid reward. With an active {color[#60FFFF06]}Nintendo Switch Online{/color} membership, you can even compete for the best score or time with other players from around the world—just check the {color[#C313FF29]}Rankings{/color}.
Menu_Main_Menu_LocalPlay	If you wish to try {color[#60FFFF06]}two-player{/color} with a nearby friend, you may do so here. You will need two Nintendo Switch systems and two copies of the {color[#C313FF29]}WarioWare: Get It Together!{/color} game.
Menu_Main_Menu_Mission	Here you will complete {color[#C313FF29]}Missions{/color} to earn coins. Focus on your score, or master a completely different play style... There is much to do. More {color[#C313FF29]}Missions{/color} will become available as you play through new areas of this game. Make sure to check this list often.
Menu_Main_Menu_Chara	This is where you can access each crew member's {color[#C313FF29]}Practice Controls {/color}and {color[#C313FF29]}Play Data{/color}. There will be even more to do here once your journey through the {color[#C313FF29]}Story{/color} comes to an end. Quite a tease, eh? See you there...
Menu_Main_Menu_Chara_complete	You may explore all sorts of crew-related things here. Customize the crew members in the {color[#C313FF29]}Break Room{/color}, collect {color[#C313FF29]}Prezzies{/color} in the {color[#C313FF29]}Emporium{/color}, check your {color[#C313FF29]}Play Data{/color}...little things like that. Please enjoy.
Menu_Story_Wario	Huh?! Where are we? How did we get here? Where's the bathroom? Ah, forget it. Let's get moving!
Menu_Story_Wario_Open	Ah! We're stuck inside the game! Let's give those {color[#C313FF29]}game bugs{/color} what's coming to 'em! Start with the {color[#C313FF29]}Intro Games {/color}level made by ME, the great {color[#49FFFFAF]}Wario{/color}! It has a bunch of simple games...so don't come crying to me if you mess up!
Menu_Story_Wario_Clear	It's me, {color[#49FFFFAF]}Wario{/color}! My {color[#C313FF29]}Intro Games{/color} level is finally bug-free—good job, me! You can play a bunch of simple games here. They'll keep coming as long as you don't mess up, so aim for a new high score! WA HA HA!
Menu_Story_Seikatsu	{color[#49FFFFAF]}Mona {/color}made these games! What did she call them? "{color[#C313FF29]}That's Life{/color}" games? Her life must be weirder than I thought! WA HA HA!
Menu_Story_Seikatsu_Clear	Ciao! It's me, {color[#49FFFFAF]}Mona{/color}! We sure swept that {color[#C313FF29]}game bug{/color} under the rug, didn't we? My flying scooter makes quick work of challenges like that! My level is {color[#C313FF29]}That's Life{/color}, where everyday events become fun games! Give it your best!
Menu_Story_Fantasy	So this is the {color[#C313FF29]}Fantasy{/color} level, huh? I think {color[#49FFFFAF]}Dribble {/color}and {color[#49FFFFAF]}Spitz{/color} made this one. Look at all the weird things in here... Wizards? Dragons? How exciting! Let's go get 'em!
Menu_Story_Fantasy_Clear	Welcome aboard, Mac! {color[#49FFFFAF]}Dribble{/color} here. {color[#49FFFFAF]}Spitz{/color} and I are still takin' fares. Our level is full of {color[#C313FF29]}Fantasy{/color} stuff. We've got everything from magic to dragons in here! Strap yourself in—we're taking the scenic route to a new high score!
Menu_Story_Technology	This is {color[#49FFFFAF]}Crygor{/color}'s level, and it's super-duper {color[#C313FF29]}High Tech{/color}! He made a bunch of games with gadgets and doohickeys that are on the cutting edge—so stay sharp in there! WA HA HA!
Menu_Story_Technology_Clear	It is me, {color[#49FFFFAF]}Dr. Crygor{/color}, the genius scientist! My level is finally back to normal... Urk! Pity, then, that my stomach is full of aches! I made some {color[#C313FF29]}High Tech{/color} games for you. I must head to the restroom rather immediately, so here—try to beat my futuristic games! Just don't break them. Urk!
Menu_Story_Nintendo	Ooh! This is the {color[#C313FF29]}Nintendo Classics{/color} level that {color[#49FFFFAF]}9-Volt{/color} made! It's full of fun goodies, from retro toys to the latest games. Hurry up and lose already—it's my turn to play next!
Menu_Story_Nintendo_Clear	I'm {color[#49FFFFAF]}9-Volt{/color}! Exterminating that {color[#C313FF29]}game bug{/color} was fun. Fixing our own game from the inside is awesome! My level's all about {color[#C313FF29]}Nintendo Classics{/color}. I've gathered my all-time favorite Nintendo stuff, from retro toys to the latest games! Play 'em over and over until you own the high score!
Menu_Story_Remix1	We've made it pretty far! Hm? What's this? {color[#C313FF29]}Remix{/color}? Does this mean...it has all of the games we've played so far?! Only one way to find out! WA HA!
Menu_Story_Remix1_Clear	My name is {color[#49FFFFAF]}Mike{/color}, and this rattly mine cart is making my bottom hurt. An odd complaint, since I can fly here. This is a {color[#C313FF29]}Remix{/color} level. You'll play a mix of {color[#C313FF29]}That's Life{/color}, {color[#C313FF29]}Fantasy{/color}, {color[#C313FF29]}High Tech{/color}, and {color[#C313FF29]}Nintendo Classics{/color} games here.
Menu_Story_Ikimono	This level was made by those itty-bitty ninjas, {color[#49FFFFAF]}Kat{/color} and {color[#49FFFFAF]}Ana{/color}! What was their theme again? {color[#C313FF29]}Nature{/color}? That means lots of ferocious animals... Don't mess up, or you might get eaten! WA HA HA!
Menu_Story_Ikimono_Clear	It's {color[#49FFFFAF]}Kat{/color}! My sister {color[#49FFFFAF]}Ana{/color} and I have squashed that {color[#C313FF29]}game bug{/color}, but we can't let our guard down. We made a bunch of {color[#C313FF29]}Nature{/color} games. They're full of insects! And flowers! And kitties! You know, nature stuff! Maybe those wild animals will let us pet them if we get a high score...
Menu_Story_Sport	This is the {color[#C313FF29]}Sports{/color} level that {color[#49FFFFAF]}Jimmy T{/color} made! It smells like it has a bunch of sports-themed games, like basketball or whatever. Sweaty gym socks... How wonderful! WA HA HA!
Menu_Story_Sport_Clear	Alright! It's your main man, {color[#49FFFFAF]}Jimmy T{/color}! That naughty {color[#C313FF29]}game bug {/color}was cuttin' a rug in my games, but my killer dance moves squashed him good. My level is all about {color[#C313FF29]}Sports{/color}. Aim for the high score, and leave some sweat sparkling on the dance floor! Yeah!
Menu_Story_Tabemono	WA HA! We've arrived at {color[#49FFFFAF]}Ashley{/color}'s{color[#49FFFFAF]} {/color}{color[#C313FF29]}Food{/color} level! That witchy little girl can really put a meal away. I've seen her wolf down ice cream, fried rice, pickled herring— GAH! Now I'm hungry! And jealous! ARRRGH!
Menu_Story_Tabemono_Clear	I'm {color[#49FFFFAF]}Ashley{/color}. I was having a good time knocking that {color[#C313FF29]}game bug{/color} around, but that's over now. Sigh. I'll have to practice my magic so I can summon one on my own time. My level is themed around {color[#C313FF29]}Food{/color}...but you can't actually eat it. Ugh, now I'm hungry again.
Menu_Story_Culture	{color[#49FFFFAF]}Orbulon{/color} made a level based on {color[#C313FF29]}Culture{/color}! Sounds like you can play games about world history and— ZZZ! Oops! I fell asleep mid-sentence! That's how boring I find CULTURE and HISTORY! Nyeh! But we've got a {color[#C313FF29]}game bug{/color} to delete, so...in we go!
Menu_Story_Culture_Clear	{color[#49FFFFAF]}Orbulon {/color}here! I've placed the {color[#C313FF29]}game bug{/color} in my collection. Now I can safely explore this wild game world! My level is a lesson in {color[#C313FF29]}Culture{/color}. I've done a lot of "research" on Earthling culture and history. You can "play" my "games" as much as you "like," oh yes!
Menu_Story_Remix2	We've come so far! No turning back now! How big is this game, anyway?! {color[#C313FF29]}Remix 2.0{/color}... Does that mean we might face any or ALL of our games thus far? WA HA HA! Bring 'em on!
Menu_Story_Remix2_Clear	Keep it up, everyone! I'm {color[#49FFFFAF]}5-Volt{/color}. This is my first time riding in a mine cart. It's like a roller coaster! Speaking of, this level is called {color[#C313FF29]}Remix 2.0{/color}, and it's like running through a theme park! You'll play games from the {color[#C313FF29]}Nature{/color}, {color[#C313FF29]}Sports{/color}, {color[#C313FF29]}Food{/color}, and {color[#C313FF29]}Culture{/color} levels. Aim for the high score, and do your best!
Menu_Story_WarioDX	Oh! We're finally at the end! This is the hardest level, so of course it was made by ME— Huh? Hey! This isn't how I wanted my final level to look! What happened to my masterpiece?! Waaah!
Menu_Story_WarioDX_Clear	WAAA HA HA! We beat the level—and that stupid {color[#C313FF29]}game bug{/color}! It put up a good fight, so I'll let it go. {color[#49FFFFAF]}Wario{/color} the Great has a big heart! This is the final level, {color[#C313FF29]}Anything Goes{/color}, built by ME! Unlike my {color[#C313FF29]}Intro Games{/color}, these won't pull any punches! That scary, handsome {color[#49FFFFAF]}Wario Bug{/color} might attack at any moment, so be ready for that. Show me your highest score!
Menu_Story_AllMix	We finally escaped the game, only to turn around and jump back in?! WAAAGH! Nowhere to go but onward. This skyscraper in here looks {color[#C313FF29]}All Mixed Up{/color}. It must mix up games from all the other levels! Let's conquer 'em all!
Menu_Story_AllMix_Clear	I'm saved! I'm also {color[#49FFFFAF]}Red{/color}. I didn't think anyone was coming to save me...b-but I didn't cry! No way! Listen—this is the {color[#C313FF29]}All Mixed Up{/color} level. Games from every genre can be played in here! It's pretty hard, so do the best you can. I'm just happy you're here.
Menu_Story_HighSpeed	Next is {color[#C313FF29]}Super Hard{/color} Tower. The games here start at a crazy-high speed. I love it! Let's hit the gas and get started! WA HA HA!
Menu_Story_HighSpeed_Clear	I am {color[#49FFFFAF]}Master Mantis{/color}. I appreciate the rescue...but I was moments away from launching my own escape plan! Quite a coincidence, eh? Cough, cough. This is the {color[#C313FF29]}Super Hard{/color} level, where games start at top speed. It's sure to be good training...for you, not me. Hop in and hone those skills!
Menu_Story_DeadOrAlive	WA HA HA! So the next treasure is in {color[#C313FF29]}Thrill Ride{/color} Tower, eh? We're gonna face the hardest games right from the start! If we mess up even once, we'll get kicked back out...but that's not gonna happen! There's treasure up there! Get out of my way!
Menu_Story_DeadOrAlive_Clear	I'm {color[#49FFFFAF]}Lulu{/color}! I didn't want to be rescued by that stinker {color[#49FFFFAF]}Wario{/color}...but I'm really glad that {color[#49FFFFAF]}Cricket{/color} is here! This is the {color[#C313FF29]}Thrill Ride{/color} level. It's incredibly hard right away, and you can't mess up—not even once! Try to grab the number one score...and try not to be number two. 'K?
Menu_Story_Penny	Sounds like {color[#49FFFFAF]}Penny{/color}'s on her way here. Does she think she can tackle those games by herself? That makes this...{color[#C313FF29]}Penny's Mix{/color}! WA HA HA! There's more treasure waiting in there, so that science girl better hurry it up!
Menu_Story_Penny_Clear	Hello! {color[#49FFFFAF]}Penny{/color} here! I've never been inside a game world before...so I'd better make this first time count! I'll call this {color[#C313FF29]}Penny's Mix{/color}, where I beat a lot of levels all by myself! How far can I make it? Let's find out! Heeere we go!
Menu_Story_BigPyoro	Huh? That big guy from earlier is back?! {color[#C313FF29]}Showdown{/color}, eh? Great! My mustache is tingling with an itch to fight! This will be different from anything else we've done so far... There's no "I" in team, but there is in Wario! So do it for I— I mean, me!
Menu_Story_BigPyoro_Clear	That lowlife didn't have any treasure! What a jerk, hopping in from another game just to get my hopes up! I guess we could challenge it to another {color[#C313FF29]}Showdown{/color}, just for laughs... Our whole team against one giant {color[#49FFFFAF]}Pyoro{/color}? If we won once, we'll win every time! Let's go! WA HA HA!
Menu_Story_Movie_WarioDX	What's their deal?! So I made a teeny-tiny, eensy-weensy mistake. That's no reason for my whole team to chase after me! If you really want to watch the ending of the {color[#C313FF29]}Anything Goes{/color} level again, it'll always be here... Just let me get a head start! WA HA HA!
Menu_Story_Movie_Penny	Say...someone is missing! {color[#49FFFFAF]}Penny{/color} wasn't with us when we were sucked into the game, was she? You can watch her playing hooky in the movie from {color[#C313FF29]}Penny's Mix{/color} here!
Menu_Story_Movie_BigPyoro	WA HA HA! The whole team is finally together—even this jerk who came from another game! You can watch the movie that introduces my whole crew right here. What a bunch of ungrateful slackers... My kind of people!
Menu_Story_Movie_Staff_Credit	If you wish to see the names of the people who worked on this game, you will find them here. Feel free to view them at your leisure.
Menu_Variety_Lock_00	You cannot play this game just yet. You must reach the end of the {color[#C313FF29]}Story{/color} first. Patience, player. Patience...
Menu_Variety_Lifting	Rain or shine, wind or snow...the only thing that matters is keeping the ball in the air. Simplicity in design is simply divine. Don't you agree?
Menu_Variety_CombatMob	Here you must plow through endless waves of enemies. Keep your guard up and stay nimble. See if you can take out 999 baddies. I believe in you, player.
Menu_Variety_SuperWarioCo	Experience an average workday at WarioWare, Inc. Race through the office to collect contracts, and try to increase game sales. Ah, how thrilling office life must be...or so I assume.
Menu_Variety_VolleyBall	Enter a volleyball competition with a five-count cutoff...and surprise twists. When the match becomes heated, all kinds of wild things might happen. It's nothing you can't handle, surely.
Menu_Variety_SurvivalBattle	In this colosseum, your only hope for survival is pure gaming skill. The gauntlet of games won't stop until one combatant falls. Good luck, WarioWare warriors.
Menu_Variety_ContributionBattle	Two players must work together to beat the same game. The player with the better performance will receive a mysterious blessing from the stars...
Menu_Variety_BalloonSplit	Anticipation, dread...and balloons, of course. The balloon will inflate with each player's turn until it eventually pops. Will you be the popper...or the poppee?
Menu_Variety_PetitParty	Go head-to-head against other players in the games within this game. Each time you win, you'll get to place a flag to create triangles and claim territory. The player with the most land wins.
Menu_Variety_PetitScramble	The first player to knock the puck into the goal gets to try the game. Rack up points by scoring goals and winning games...or by doing everything you can to stop other players from winning. Either tactic is a valid path to victory.
Menu_Variety_CombatVirsus	Behold! An all-out battle with constantly swapping crew members. Take advantage of each stage's gimmicks and items until you're the last player standing.
Menu_Collection	These games have been organized by {color[#C313FF29]}genre{/color}. Pick your favorite and play to your heart's content. You can check to see which crew member made each game as well.
Menu_Collection_Clear	Select the {color[#C313FF29]}genre{/color} of the game you'd like to play. Oh—and if you change the number of crew members to {color[#C313FF29]}All{/color} and perform well enough to exceed the {color[#60FFFF06]}passing{/color} score for the first time, you'll earn some coins. Splendid, isn't it? Please enjoy.
Menu_LocalPlay	You may connect to a friend's system here. You can select {color[#60FFFF06]}Create{/color} to host a game as {color[#C313FF29]}P1{/color}, or select {color[#60FFFF06]}Join{/color} to enter a nearby game as an additional player. {color[#C313FF29]}P1{/color} will perform most of the controls during the game, so think carefully before you begin.
Menu_Mission	Missions are separated into four types. Missions of the same type are further divided by color to let you know where you can complete them. Read the requirements carefully, then start with the ones you know you'll complete with ease. Fret not, player. I know you'll perform splendidly.
Menu_Chara_Park	{color[#C313FF29]}Practice Controls {/color}will help you master each crew member's moves. Don't hesitate to use this if you require a refresher.
Menu_Chara_Park_complete	Select a crew member to spend some time with. You can give them {color[#C313FF29]}Prezzies{/color} or new {color[#C313FF29]}Job Titles{/color}, change their color scheme...little things like that. You may also master their moves in {color[#C313FF29]}Practice Controls{/color}.
Menu_Chara_Shop	This is where you can buy {color[#C313FF29]}Prezzies{/color} to give to your crew. Some items might be {color[#C313FF29]}on sale{/color}, but rare items can only be won in the {color[#C313FF29]}Cluckade{/color}. {color[#C313FF29]}Prezzies{/color} will be added to the {color[#C313FF29]}Prezzy Stash{/color} as you unlock them. Do you have the skill and patience to collect each and every one?
Menu_Chara_Data	Stop here to check crew-related stats based on the games you've played thus far. You may learn things about your own play habits, like which crew members you use most often, which ones you play best with, and more. Mmm. Isn't data wonderful?
Chara_Park	Select a crew member. Don't just pick your favorite every time... The others might grow quite bored. And lonely. Poor things...
Chara_Locked	You can't select this mode yet. Patience, player. Patience...
Chara_Tutorial	Get comfortable with this crew member's moves in {color[#C313FF29]}Practice Controls{/color}. If you ever forget what this crew member can do, this option will be of considerable help.
Chara_Item	Feeling generous? You can give {color[#C313FF29]}Prezzies{/color} to crew members here. Reward their hard work with a gift, and their {color[#C313FF29]}Job Title{/color} will advance. As {color[#C313FF29]}Prezzies{/color} go, each crew member has their own likes and dislikes. Take note of their reactions.
Chara_coloring	You may change this crew member's color scheme here. Make them look cool, cute, funny, or stylish—whatever you prefer. Additional color palettes for each character will unlock as they earn new {color[#C313FF29]}Job Titles{/color}.
Chara_Gallery	This is where you can view all of the {color[#C313FF29]}Crew Member Art{/color} that you've collected. Advance a crew member's {color[#C313FF29]}Job Title{/color} for a chance to earn new art.
Shop_Sale	You can use coins to buy {color[#C313FF29]}Prezzies{/color} here. The inventory is refreshed after a while, so it would be wise to grab any items that you seek right away. If nothing is catching your eye, you can return later and check again.
Shop_Gacha	Turn the {color[#C313FF29]}Cluckade{/color} dials to win new {color[#C313FF29]}Prezzies{/color}. {color[#60FFFF06]}1 turn{/color} will get you 1 item. To claim several items all at once, pick "10×". There's no telling what you'll get from the machine on the left, but the one on the right will always give you an item with a {color[#60FFFF06]}rarity{/color} of {color[#60FFFF06]}3{/color}-{color[#60FFFF06]}5 ★s{/color}.
Shop_Item	Admire the {color[#C313FF29]}Prezzies{/color} you've collected in here. When you give {color[#C313FF29]}Prezzies{/color} to crew members, you'll be able to see which ones liked or disliked each gift. Don't take it personally... Some people are just hard to shop for.

Menu_CharaSelect_Collection	Select which crew members you want on your team, then select {color[#60FFFF06]}Play{/color}. The icons next to each crew member will tell you if they're a good fit for the current game—quite a useful feature, if I do say so myself.
Menu_CharaSelect_ScoreAttack	If a crew member is showing a high {color[#60FFFF06]}difficulty rating{/color}, it means choosing them will make this Challenge harder to complete...but if you do, you'll get a much higher score. If you choose crew members with lower {color[#60FFFF06]}difficulty ratings{/color} instead, they'll make it easier to complete the Challenge, but you'll get a lower score. Consider your options carefully...
CombatVirsus_0	Whoever owns this desk prefers a tidy workplace. There's lots of room and few obstacles—perfect for intense, focused battles.
CombatVirsus_1	This stage is set in an aquarium—rather far inside, in fact. The water level will rise and fall over time. Water will slow your movements, so try to use that to your advantage.
CombatVirsus_2	Are you ready for some surprises? This stage features a large machine holding a variety of capsules. When you see a coin enter the slot, pull the lever and get ready for something delightful. Be warned—some nasty tricks might also be hiding in there. Hee hee.
CombatVirsus_3	The time has come...for pinball. Try to avoid the flippers and bumpers. If you hit them, you'll get knocked all around the stage. Those thorns don't look very kind either. Have a ball out there—but do be careful.

PetitCommentary.wmbt
Treasure	Wahaha, those jewels look pricey. Hurry and grab 'em all!
Maze	My stomach! It hurts! Hmm. Maaaybe it was something I ate? If you see something weird in there, get rid of it for me.
Gold	Nothing's better than a bag stuffed with moolah! Hey... Stop that! Keep that up, and my precious gold will spill out!
Wanted	Those look-alikes are some handsome devils, eh? Check out that wanted poster, and help catch the bad guy. Don't let their disguises trick you!
Hypnosis	That watch...it's making me feel...sleepy. Get rid of that butterfly so I can take a nap!
Constellation	Those stars are so dull and boring! Touch them, and they'll not only shine like gold, they'll light up a whole constellation. Eh, if you're into pretty stuff, you'll probably like it.
Rocket	3...2...1...WARIO TIME! I mean, LIFT OFF! Jump into an empty rocket, and blast into space. Eh, but watch out! Not all of these rockets have what it takes to get off the ground. 
Sand	Gah! I can't get down from here! Knock over the stick to help me land safely. You can shake the ground to knock it over, too, if that's how you get your kicks.
Vision	Time for an eye exam, Dr. Wario style! Turn the shape until it matches the one I picked. Let's SEE if you can do it. Ha! I'm so funny!
Hockey	Don't let the meteorite smash those flowers! Knock that hunk of rock right off the screen if you can.
Sleep	Don't even think about trying to steal my garlic! I'm keeping an eye on it with my flashlight. Sure, sometimes I get a little distracted...but nobody's getting by Wario!
Restraint	You! Yes, you, with the face! Help me draw my sword. Huh? What do you mean it looks weird? Less excuses and more sword!
BossRush	Watch out! Spiky Wario is coming through! It's dangerous to get too close. Hey... Ow! The spots without spikes are sensitive, you know.
Wario_Lock	You haven't even played this game yet. Sheesh! Go play my {color[#C313FF29]}Intro Games{/color} level, and it'll show up eventually. Patience is a virtue, blah, blah, blah.
Tube	Load up your toothbrush with some toothpaste! The trick is to squeeze it from the end. Wait... What?! That's not toothpaste!
Nose	Every nose needs a finger to keep it company, don't you think? Tee-hee! Well, don't delay! Jump inside that lonely nostril! Oh, and empty nostrils are a good place for boomerangs and other projectiles too.
Cleaner	The vacuum wants what it wants. Right now it wants to suck up only dust of the same color. Careful, or you may get sucked up as well.
Clock	Oh no! The alarm clock stopped working. How will I stay on schedule? Line up the hands to display the correct time. Goodness, I'd hate to be late for, well, anything.
Pack	Moisturizing masks are so refreshing, don't you think? Peel off the mask to reveal a glowing complexion. Start with the part that's already falling away. So satisfying!
Nursery	You're lost in a strange kid's room. Hide among the toys and other kid stuff so you won't be found!
Tooth	My goodness, look at all those pearly whites. Just make sure you don't get bitten! The gaps between the teeth are the perfect place to hide.
Slot	Where has that silly TV remote gone? Huh?! What's it doing there?! Grab it for me, please, but watch out for the thumbtacks sticking out of the wall.
Glasses	Aww, that man's glasses are all fogged up. Get rid of the source of the fog to help him see clearly again. Consider it your good deed for the day.
Poster	Time to tidy up this whiteboard! Take the old poster down by knocking off the colorful magnet that holds it in place. I do love a fresh start!
Wash	Ew, what a mess! Wash all that dirt away with water. Don't forget to turn off the faucet when you're done.
Dark	It's dark! TOO dark! Hurry up, and turn on the lights!
Noise	How rude! That person is playing their music waaay too loud and disturbing everyone around them. Take off their headphones, and tell them what's what!
Pig	Everyone could use a little extra spending money now and again. Knock that piggy bank off its perch to break it open. There's plenty of mad money waiting inside!
Bag	Gross! You were thrown away like yesterday's garbage. Untie the knot and escape!
Cradle	Aww, that poor baby sounds tired. Rock the cradle rhythmically to help soothe it to sleep. 
Drain	These pipes are all out of sorts! Rotate them into the right position so the water can flow.
Face	Rinse the bubbles off of that soapy face. You'll need to splash vigorously to get all the suds off. You can do it!
Diy	Look at all those nails sticking out! They're just begging to be hammered in. Pick a nail—any nail—and have at it!
Wait	Oh my! Company is coming for a visit! Better tidy up, and fast!
Intercom	Hellooo! Is anyone home? Yes? No? Hmph! Just keep ringing the doorbell until someone is polite enough to answer.
Stopper	Hmmm... There's something hiding in the water. If you pull the chain and remove the plug, I bet you'll find out what it is!
BossDelivery	Time to go to work at the delivery center! Look at the monitor, and pack each box accordingly. If you grab the wrong item, don't panic. Just throw it in the trashcan, and try again. You've got this!
Seikatsu_Lock	Um, looks like this game isn't ready to step into the spotlight yet. If you play my {color[#C313FF29]}That's Life{/color} level some more, I just know it'll show itself.
Buster	Some weird mushroom monsters showed up! I don't care how ya do it, just get rid of 'em!
Nightmare	A nightmare's botherin' that pooch. Get rid of it so the poor pup can sleep!
Crown	That mischief-makin' dragon stole the crown! Steal it back, and show him who's boss!
Count	Count the floatin' soap bubbles! Popped bubbles change the number, so watch out for that.
Rock	That's a real spooky monster over there! Better get outta there, and FAST. I have a hunch that wind can help.
Safety	Watch out! A meteor shower is on the way! Take shelter beneath the Jumboman Brothers. They're a couple of tough guys, alright.
Windmill	That windmill must be hidin' somethin'. Don't ask me how I know these things, I just do. So spin it already, and see what happens!
Angel	I got a soft spot in my heart for cats. So, how about you do a good deed, and catch some fish for these angelic felines I know. But be warned...it's a shockingly bad idea to give 'em too many!
Fan	A flower fan is blowin' up a storm, and it's about to blow a poor little elf away! See if you can help 'em get to higher ground!
Watering	I like waterin' plants. Relaxes me after a long shift behind the wheel. But I gotta ask... Is this thing really a plant?
Swing	Help the two lovebirds on the swings smooch! It don't get much more romantic than that, am I right?
Magic	A dark wizard is castin' some nasty spells. Try to steer clear of whatever he throws your way, or maybe deflect his spell with your own attack.
Separation	You've heard the sayin', "It's raining cats and dogs." Yeah, well, now the sky is raining all sorts of random stuff! Be sure to sort the stuff correctly if you wanna see a beeeautiful rainbow.
Invader	Oh brother! Unidentified flying buttocks (that's UFBs) are tryin' to invade! But don't sweat it. You can knock 'em all out at once if you aim right. It's like bowling—but with flying butts!
Curtain	Quite the curtain conundrum you got here, pal. This vampire can't stand the sunlight. But the rose is gonna wilt without it. Open the curtain. Close the curtain. You decide!
Moon	Drop a big ol' weight onto the seesaw and—BOOM—you'll send the astronaut to the moon! Ahhh, ain't space grand?
Poseidon	Whoa! That's some mighty armpit hair right there! I hear the big fella prefers a smoother look, so ya better yank those hairs out, and fast.
Shadow	Some kinda spell is making everyone all shadowy. I don't like it one bit! Figure out where you are, and defeat the witch!
Slime	This poor blob of slime is splattered all over the place. Put it back together again, and you'll put a smile on its face. But, uh, it's pretty wiggly and jiggly, so good luck with that.
Tear	Rumor has it pearls are made from mermaid tears. That's too weird to not be true! Collect the mermaid's tears to make a necklace. It's snot a problem if some of those drops come from her nose. Pearls are pearls!
Catch	A trap has been set to catch some sneaky space aliens. But listen up... You gotta cut the vine at just the right time, or they'll escape. Trust me, pal, ya don't want that.
Touch	Everyone loves a high five, am I right? Of course, it ain't always easy to land a good one. But go on, try to high-five whoever happens by. Who cares if it's a little awkward?
BossShip	Grrrr! Poseidon is attacking those poor little fairies! Fend off his tentacles, and do whatever ya gotta do to save 'em. He really oughta pick on someone his own size!
Fantasy_Lock	Looks like this game hasn't reared its head yet, pal. It might show up if you play my {color[#C313FF29]}Fantasy{/color} level a bit more!
Building	Gaaah! The building is on fire! Whatever you do, don't panic. Also...GET TO THE HELICOPTER ON THE ROOF!
Cockpit	I daresay it's time for takeoff! Use the guide to flip the right switches in the right order and launch the rocket. To space we go!
Jump	I don't mean to alarm you, but an out-of-control jet-powered cyborg is headed this way! Figure out which direction it's coming from, and then dodge it with panache.
Train	I do love a nice, long locomotive ride. Alas, I don't live near a train station. I suppose I shall have to live vicariously through you. Please memorize which train car is empty, and then hop aboard when the time is right. Choo-choo!
Shutter	Let's take a picture, shall we? I'm told it will last longer. Simply make sure that you are completely within the frame before the shutter closes. That way I can remember you in all your glory!
Beam	As a man of science, I do love a good laser beam. But I daresay there are far too many of them pointed in your general direction. I recommend you find a safe spot to hide before the lasers power up.
Magnet	There is a magnet, and there are pieces of metal...and I daresay the laws of physics want them to come together. So, use the magnet to attract the metal...or move the metal toward the magnet. Just let magnetism do its thing!
Tanker	An asteroid is hurtling our way! We're doomed, I say, DOOMED! That is, unless you can turn the wheel and steer the spaceship out of harm's way? I await your move with bated breath!
Circuit	Allow me to enlighten you! The goal here is to turn switches that will connect light bulbs to the battery that powers them. But beware! Making the wrong connection could be an explosive mistake!
Virus	How rude! Computer bugs have invaded the inter-tubes and are blocking my email from getting through. Do please exterminate them so my precious webmail reaches its destination.
Conveyor	Good gravity! It seems you've gotten lost during a factory tour! Not to worry. Simply follow the conveyor belt to the exit. But do mind the machinery. It'll flatten you faster than you can say "total kinetic energy."
Popup	Hmph! I was browsing the internet, minding my own business, when a bunch of ads popped up out of nowhere. Get rid of them for me. Please!
Warp	A spaceship is attempting to achieve warp speed. Help it along by nudging the rings up and down until they align. I do hope you've brushed up on your astrophysics!
Ropeway	Why, it seems a gondola has become stuck before reaching its destination! See if you can't do something to the cable that holds it to get those poor passengers where they're trying to go!
Like	I confess, I've become quite enamored with streaming videos of late. Why don't you watch one with me now? When it's over, simply push the button that expresses the correct emotion. Observe the boy's reaction for valuable data!
Crane	I'd like you to swing a wrecking ball into a building and destroy it for me. Not to worry, it's for science! This wrecking ball can be quite powerful if you get some momentum behind it. You might also try directly attacking the building yourself. Experimentation is key!
Spot	Good gallium, why is it so hard to find a decent hot spot when I need one?! Please, I have an urgent science-y message to send. Help me find a strong Wi-Fi signal, won't you?
Spring	Eureka! I've invented a clockwork dog! This mechanical marvel is eco-friendly but may run low on puppy power. When it stops in its tracks, simply wind it up to get it moving again. Bow-wow, indeed.
Block	This poor fellow seems to be trapped! The logical course of action is to break the blocks to match the shape shown on the monitor. Succeed and he'll be set free. Fail and he'll be transformed. Fret not—I hear the transformation is only temporary!
Docking	Some call my method for assembling Tigronic robots "absurd." Bah! I call it genius! One must assemble these robots from the bottom up, stacking each part as it falls from above on top of the part that came before it. The stacked pieces don't even need to line up perfectly! Unconventional but effective! 
Scrap	The watering robot I invented can only move in a straight line. Perhaps I didn't think this through... In any case, please help lead it to the thirsty plant!
Naked	Eeegads! Those poor robots! They've just returned from a relaxing soak, and now a fan is about to blow their towels off! Protect their mechanical modesty—either cover them up or point the fan elsewhere.
BossRobot	Here's your chance to take control of an assembly arm and use it to put many wonderful things together. All you'll need to do is follow the instructions on the monitor and move in the same way you usually do. Isn't technology marvelous?
Technology_Lock	This game has yet to be discovered. I'm almost certain it will come to light if you continue playing the marvelous {color[#C313FF29]}High Tech{/color} level I invented.
Fuzzy	Collect every coin, but DO NOT touch a Fuzzy! Trust me on this one.　{color[#C313FF29]}2012: Wii U{/color}
Hatena	Bonk the ? Block to score a coin or item. Old-school games are the coolest!　{color[#C313FF29]}1989: Game Boy{/color}
Morph	Did you know Samus can turn into a Morph Ball and roll around and stuff? Isn't she THE COOLEST?! Help her get to the exit!　{color[#C313FF29]}1994: SNES{/color}
Animal	Pop the balloon at just the right moment to deliver the present to a villager! It doesn't matter which villager gets the gift—it's just nice to be nice, ya know?{color[#C313FF29]}　2013: Nintendo 3DS{/color}
Badge	Ack! Don't let the claw catch you like you're some kind of collectible badge! You can run away from it or even try attacking it to make it go away. Shoo, claw, SHOO!{color[#C313FF29]}　2015: Nintendo 3DS{/color}
Flower	Attack the Pellet Posies to collect the pellets! You can't harvest pellets from flowers that haven't bloomed, so don't waste precious time trying to do something silly like that.{color[#C313FF29]}　2004: Nintendo GameCube{/color}
Head	Pick two pieces that'll match the shape of the silhouette when you combine them. This one's like homework, only it's fun because it's a video game!{color[#C313FF29]}　2006: Nintendo DS{/color}
Koopa	Do whatever you gotta do to beat Bowser! Dude's got it coming. Now for a hint from the world's biggest Nintendo fan: grabbing the axe behind him will totally do the trick!{color[#C313FF29]}　1985: NES{/color}
Talk	This school seems different from my school... I mean REALLY DIFFERENT. For starters, this school has tea parties. Not only that, but you gotta say the exact right thing at these tea parties. Say something weird and things get super awkward. Good luck. {color[#C313FF29]}2019: Nintendo Switch{/color}
Climber	Time to climb! Race to the top of the mountain, breaking blocks along the way when you need to. But watch out for falling icicles!{color[#C313FF29]}　1985: NES{/color}
Barrel	OK, this is serious stuff! You gotta defeat all the enemies on the screen! Hey...is that Donkey Kong's voice I hear?　{color[#C313FF29]}2010: Wii{/color}
Set	Yay! It's time to play some old WarioWare games! Hold on...some of these things are shaped like games but aren't games at all. Ugh. Don't let anything in that's not a game. It'll ruin my system!{color[#C313FF29]}　2004: Nintendo GameCube "WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Party Game$!" / 2005: Nintendo DS "WarioWare: Touched!" / 2003: Game Boy Advance "WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!"{/color}
Destiny	Time for some OLD old-school fun! In this board game, you've got to stop the spinner on the number that lets you move your piece the right number of spaces to reach the goal. Didja know that Nintendo used to make board games too? So cool!{color[#C313FF29]}　1969 (Japan): Destiny Board Game{/color}
Ink	Hmm...can you tell which team inked more turf? Pick a side and head that way! The honorable Judd and Li'l Judd will deliver the final verdict.{color[#C313FF29]}　2017: Nintendo Switch{/color}
Devil	Oooh, there's sooo much retro goodness in this game! You've gotta navigate a maze and try to stay alive while the screen scrolls. Keep moving so you don't get squished!{color[#C313FF29]}　1984 (Japan): Famicom{/color}
Stasis	Wow! Link is sooo cool! He stopped that object in its tracks using the Stasis Rune! Strike it to build up kinetic energy and send it flying.{color[#C313FF29]}　2017: Nintendo Switch, Wii U{/color}
Ghost	Jeepers! Ghosts are hiding in the furniture! Talk about c-c-creeepy. Find the ghosts so Luigi can get rid of 'em!{color[#C313FF29]}　2001: Nintendo GameCube{/color}
Toad	Oh no, Captain Toad is stuck and can't get to the Power Star! Move things around to create a path for him!{color[#C313FF29]}　2014: Wii U{/color}
Conga	Did you know that Nintendo made an electronic drum machine back in the olden days? So cool! Just turn the Ele-Conga's handle to get the beat going and the people dancing.{color[#C313FF29]}　1972 (Japan): Ele-Conga{/color}
Judge	Time for a pop quiz! And it's math too! Just pick the side that has the highest number. HA! The student has become the teacher!{color[#C313FF29]}　1980: Game & Watch{/color}
Mawaru	You play this game by twisting the Game Boy Advance system around. Check out the screen to see what you need to do, and then get twistin'!{color[#C313FF29]}　2005: Game Boy Advance{/color}
Yoshi	Time to collect some eggs! Be sure to pick up the right amount, and don't forget to check the blocks too.{color[#C313FF29]}　1998: Nintendo 64{/color}
BossWorld	Time for an epic adventure through a classic Super Mario World level! Try not to get hit by enemies as you race to the Goal Pole. Have fun, but don't forget there's a time limit.{color[#C313FF29]}　1991: SNES{/color}
Nintendo_Lock	Um, awkward. You haven't unlocked this game yet. No big. Just play my {color[#C313FF29]}Nintendo Classics{/color} level some more, and you'll get it.
Chameleon	Aww, that chameleon has a bunch of stuff stuck to its tongue! The poor thing needs your help. Try to unstick the stuff, but don't touch its tongue, or the results will be shocking!
Fly	Gross! A bunch of flies showed up, and they are WAY too ew. Shoo them away already!
Egg	Hmm, that egg looks ready to hatch, but it's taking too long. Help it along by cracking the shell, OK?
Crayfish	Uh-oh! Somehow a crayfish got into the fish tank! The fish are in danger, so see if you can shoo that pest away.
Turtle	Mr. Turtle won't come out to play while he's upside down. Help him get back on his feet!
Dangomushi	Did you know that pill bugs roll up into little balls when you touch 'em? It's SO adorable! Try to make the pill bugs roll into a ball so we can enjoy their cuteness, OK?
Sunshine	Flowers can't bloom without the sun. Scoot those clouds away so the flowers can grow big and strong!
Droppings	Is that rain? EW, NO! It's bird poop. That's super yucky. Don't get hit, because...GROSS!
Buffalo	Wild animals are running...uh, WILD! Be careful as you cross the road so you don't get trampled.
Duck	Those baby ducklings are sooo adorable and sooo lost! Help reunite them with the mama duck!
Peep	Hey! Something is trying to reach through that crack! What IS it? Knock it free, and I bet you find out.
Thirsty	That pupper looks super thirsty. Move its tongue so it can get a nice, refreshing drink of water!
Monochrome	Time to focus like a ninja! Look carefully, and then answer the question. The animals are all black-and-white, so it can be kinda confusing.
Wheel	Look how cute that hamster is running in its little wheel! Wait a minute... Mr. Hamster can't stop! Be a hamster hero, and stop the wheel!
Cat	This is a little gross, but can you help cover the kitty's special business with some sand? Try moving the litter slowly and starting from far away. Thanks, and sorry!
Giraffe	Feed the giraffe! You can do this by moving their necks or their food. Just don't forget they're vegetarians!
Bear	These polar bears really want to punch some ice. Help 'em out by getting the cubes close enough for them to reach. But be careful not to get in their way! Hmm...I wonder what's inside the ice cubes.
Chick	Give the hungry birdies some food from the basket! I don't know why they don't just fly to get it? Oh well, I guess that's their business.
Spider	A beautiful butterfly is stuck in a stupid spiderweb! You HAVE TO help it escape!
Raven	Chase away the scary snakes! Just try not to frighten the other animals while you're at it, OK?
Dust	Aww, the creatures of the ocean shouldn't have to live with our garbage. Help clean up their home by getting the trash into the net. The currents can be a big help!
Fluff	Can you blow all of the dandelion fluff into the air? It's sooo pretty! Hm? My rabbit radar is going crazy for some reason...
BossSafari	Cool! This safari is full of animals! Try to remember what kinds of animals you saw, where they were, and what they were doing. There's going to be a quiz at the end, so PAY ATTENTION!
Ikimono_Lock	Oh, you haven't come across this game just yet... No problem, just play our {color[#C313FF29]}Nature{/color} level over and over and over again until it comes up!
Balloon	Ooh, this ball is way flat! Pump those pumps to pump it back up. I'm pumped! You pumped? Alright!
Lifting	Don't let the ball touch the ground! Watch its shadow on the way down, then bop it back up. Oh yeah!
Fishing	We snagged a fish! Time to get reel, oh yeah! Knock the fishing rod back to pull it in.
Scuba	This diver can't get to the coral reef. Knock that funky junk out of their way, yeah!
Yoga	This dude has perfect balance. Hey! Let's mess with him, ha ha! Knock him down before time runs out!
Basket	Get the balls in the basket! Sometimes you'll move the basket, sometimes you'll move the ball. It's a funky metaphor for life, ha ha!
Skydiving	Whoa! That skydiver is in trouble! You should probably do something to save him, y'know?
Check	Think you can keep track ON the track? Ha ha! Tap the button once for every runner that breezes by!
Kickover	The horizontal bar is tough, y'know? Be nice, and help these gymnasts get over it!
Shoot	Ooh, watch out! The other team is taking their shot. We can't lose the big game! Knock the ball away from our net, ya dig?
Dance	Show these folks how to dance! Move their arms and hips to help them sway back and forth. Oh yeah!
Training	Hey, hey! Time to do some lifting! Doing curls is a great way to build muscle. But you gotta do them all the way or it doesn't count!
Archery	Hey now! The archer can't hit the target like that! Help this cool cat score a bull's-eye by making some adjustments before the arrow flies.
What	Playing sports in the dark? Yo, that's wild! Wipe the shadows away to check out the action and answer the question.
Polo	Bop the ball into the goal to win. Knock the goalies away, or our funk is sunk!
Bunker	Aw shucks. The ball got stuck in the sand trap. Let's just nudge it back up on the green. I won't tell if you don't.
Bike	Yo, talk about a vicious cycle! Push the spokes of the bike to turn the tires and win the race, YEAH!
Punch	Let's hit it—boxing style! Lean the boxer back, then send their punch flying! Ha ha! Ow.
Golf	This golfer has got no groove! Let's make the green less mean, ya dig? Move the ground around to help 'em get a hole in one!
Avoidance	This boxer wants to take you down! Keep moving so they don't knock you out, alright? Alright!
Swimming	That island is so close... Give the swimmer's arms a poke so they can finish their stroke! Go, man, go!
Racket	See if you can knock that baseball memorabilia off its pegs. It's cool—we'll put it right back where it came from!
BossBouldering	Feelin' bold? Then let's do some bouldering! Move the climber's arms and legs, and scale the wall to the summit. But watch out for those crows. They are NOT groovy!
Sport_Lock	Whoa, hold up! You haven't danced to this game's tune yet. Don't sweat it. Just play more of my {color[#C313FF29]}Sports{/color} level, and it'll turn up, ha ha!
Apple	Make all the apples fall out of the tree. You can knock them down one by one or shake the tree trunk. Or whatever. I barely even care.
Candy	Sigh. This kid is upset because rocks got mixed in with his candy. Get rid of the rocks, and leave the candy behind. It'll make him happy, or whatever.
Dinner	It's time for dinner, so grab a seat...if you can. These animals have no table manners, so you better move fast.
Mixer	People like smoothies, I guess. So blend the fruit together. Keep going until it's all one color.
Stove	Do you smell something...tasty? Move the slider to set the stove to the right temperature. Sigh. I hope you're better at this than Red is.
Tanuki	Here's the deal. You erase some letters, and I'll cast a spell to make some food appear. I mean, I'm a witch, so it's NBD.
Snack	The dessert is in danger. Protect it. I am dead serious. 
Pool	I am...displeased. Someone put inedible junk in with the vegetables. Get it out before I get...more displeased.
Drop	There's something round stuck in a bottle. Spin the bottle to get it out. Don't worry, you'll get your just desserts.
Roll	This dessert is called a roll cake. Put the finishing touches on it, and you'll see why.
Scale	Curses! There's too much stuff on this scale. See if you can get the needle into the red area. Go on.
Shuffle	Look carefully at the food on the plate. Can you keep track of where it goes? Well, can you?
Corn	Corn on the cob. Delicious. Don't let a single kernel go to waste. I insist.
Alms	Sigh. Children are always so hungry. Be sure to feed the ones with their mouths open. Hmm...perhaps I should get Red to feed me like this...
Bottle	How did you get stuck inside a bottle? Never mind. I don't really care. To get out, just pop the cork, or break the bottle...or just do whatever.
Pizza	I'm hungry. Knead the dough to make something...delicious. Beware! I'll put a curse on you if you drop it on the floor.
Icecream	They say, "Don't cry over spilled ice cream." But that kid is going to be crying his eyes out any minute now...unless you keep those scoops from hitting the ground.
Step	You should probably avoid all vegetables. They can be very bad for your health. At least in this stair...case.
Feast	Food orders are up. Just get the dishes to the waiter. Try not to drool while you work. That would be gross.
Pasta	These dishes would taste much better with ketchup on them. Lots and lots of ketchup. Feel free to slather it on.
Cake	Light the candles on the cake. Whose birthday is it? No idea.
Banana	Peel the banana. Go on. It won't bite...probably.
BossGrape	You can't make grape juice without crushing a few grapes. Actually, you'll need to crush a lot of grapes. Try not to spill them, or that farmer will get angry. Ugh. I totally understand how he feels.
Tabemono_Lock	This game isn't ready to come out of the oven yet. Keep playing my {color[#C313FF29]}Food{/color} level, and it'll show up piping hot soon enough.
Balance	When I visited a market in Asia, I saw many wonderful souvenirs for the buying. Alas, the scales must be perfectly balanced before I can pay the monies. Can you help poor Orbulon?
Wedding	Earth peoples are so strange and so loud! Ring this bell many times so these two humans can celebrate something called love. Bing! Bong! Bing! Bong! Love is too loud!
Bamboo	Ooh! In Japan I learned how to make a waterfall out of bamboo! Just help the water flow over the sticks to reach the bamboo at the bottom. It will go CLANK. Neato!
Spotlight	Earth theater entertains me. I laugh. I cry. But I cannot laugh OR cry if I cannot see the performer on the stage. That is what the spotlight is for. Help me see what's happening onstage! 
Box	Line up three boxes in a row and—poof—an Earth person appears! You humans call this "magic." That is silly. Magic is not real. Oops. I hope I didn't ruin your day.
Dig	They say ancient treasures are buried under the ground. Might I learn Earth's secrets if I dig them out? Better idea! YOU dig them out. Thank you and please.
Blimp	Humans! So clever! You fill balloons with hot air so you can fly. Now move the balloon back and forth so your fellow humans can jump into the basket and go for a ride.
Tea	Ooh, tea time! Swoosh the tea bag around to steep the tea. Mmm, scrummy snacks will be your reward.
Ninja	Did you know that ninjas like to play hide-and-seek? They do! They do! Watch closely, then find them in their hidey spot!
Handcar	Look at this funny vehicle! Push the handles up and down to make it move forward. My spaceship is powered the same way, you know. Ha. Ha. I made a joke.
Circus	This circus does not have clowns. But it does have rings of fire! Get through them without getting burned. Where are the clowns when you need them?
Matryoshka	How strange! The big doll has smaller dolls hiding inside of it! Can you find the doll the girl is looking for?
Xmas	A tree decorated for one of your human holidays is hiding in the dark. Follow the bells to find the star at the top and turn on the lights. So pretty! So cheery! So holiday-y!
Guitar	Humans love the rock and the roll. Strum the guitar to hear them cheer!
Kids	Ack! Fire! Oh my, what a convenient place for a Manneken Pis! Use the statue to douse the flames.
Signboard	Earth's festivals amuse me. Swing the dangly holiday items out of the way, and tell me what's behind them. So cheery! So strange!
Garden	What is this ivy hiding? Orbulon must know! Break through the roots to reveal the secrets!
Horn	My, my! What a large horn this is! And there's something wedged inside. Push it out, human. Let Orbulon take a look.
Mask	Look at these masks from different countries! If you are playing by yourself, put on the same mask as the sneaky fox. If you are playing with another human, you two should put on matching masks.
Fireworks	Light the fuse! Set off the fireworks! Eh he he! Orbulon approves of explosive fun!
Percussion	Music time! You are the orchestra's lead percussionist. Follow the conductor's cue. Play the correct instrument. Orbulon insists.
Snowman	You think you know how to build a snowman? Ha! Orbulon doubts it. Try to build a snowman exactly as shown, one piece at a time. Go on, human. Try.
BossBridge	Earthlings on boats! Earthlings in cars! We must help them. Raise and lower the bridge so the ships and cars can get through. You are welcome, Earthlings.
Culture_Lock	The time for this game is not now, Earthling. Play my {color[#C313FF29]}Culture{/color} level lots and lots. Only then will it be time.
Escape	Hey! There's somethin' inside this box! I can't wait to get my hands on whatever it is. Hehehe. You can run, but you can't hide!
Pipe	Check out those pipes! Follow the right pipe, you get a biiiig shiny diamond. Follow the wrong pipe...you go BOOM! Eh, good luck with that.
Nose2	Waaaah! Where did my beautiful nose go? It's the one with the most handsome mustache in the whole wide world attached to it! Don't just stand there. Help me find it!
Storm	Can you make it home in this horrible storm? Not if I have anything to do with it. Bwahahaha!
Who	Quiz time, smarty-pants! I ask you a question, you press the buttons for the right answer. But the real question is, how many of my questions can you get right? 
Ribbon	I got you a present. Pretty nice of me, eh? Just pull the yellow ribbon the right direction to open it. Pull it the wrong direction, and no present for you!
Frypan	Oopsie! I accidentally dropped something into the piggy bank. Go on, lift it up to me so I can pull it out. I don't have all day, ya know.
Domino	Want to see me flex my muscles? Of course you do! I just need a liiittle help with the competition. Give the show-offs a shove, and they'll make room for yours truly to take the stage!
Beaker	What you gotta do here is raise the water level inside the beaker. It's easy. Just push some objects into it. And if you run out of time, just jump into the beaker yourself. No, really! Would I lie to you?
Animation	I'm the best artist in the world! One look at the comics I drew on these sticky notes and you'll see. Peel the notes off one by one as quickly as you can to watch my pretty pictures move!
Cracker	It's MY birthday, and that means you gotta do what I say. And I say you should pop a party popper to celebrate ME. Just wrap the string around the pins, and pull until it goes KABLOOEY!
Janken	Think you can beat me at a game of rock-paper-scissors? BaHA, you WISH! Spin the cards and take your best shot, why don't you.
Snatch	What's this? A purse snatcher?! Drop that crook into the manhole, and return the stolen goods. Bah! Can't have someone more vile than me hangin' around.
Push	Help the one-and-only Wario knock his opponent out of the ring. Shake the ground! Push him around! Make me number one...OR ELSE!
Garlic	Garlic makes my breath smell so good! So how about you help me collect some. Just tip the basket to catch the falling bulbs. But watch out—this garlic is very bouncy. 
Behind	Bwahaha! Ghost Wario has come to haunt you. Look at me, following you everywhere! I sure hope you don't bump me into any of those pointy things. Gah! I've said too much!
Carry	Hey, look, I found some treasure! Now hurry up, and load it into the truck so I can bring it home. I'm going to be riiiich! Eh, what do you mean you want a cut?
Down	Better watch out! That pillar is gonna fall over! Quick—find a gap so you don't get flattened like a pancake. Blech! You'd make a terrible pancake.
Wall	Bugs! Blech! These ruins are overrun with 'em. Find them and defeat them. And don't miss the ones that are hiding!
Mirror	You're trapped in a weird castle with an even weirder mirror. All you gotta do is grab the key, move your mirror image to the mirror-image door, and escape. Only thing is, up is down...and down is up. Like I said, it's weird in there!
Same	This is my room. I like it a lot. I like it so much, I want the one next to it to look EXACTLY the same. So help me out here. Make 'em matchy-matchy.
Fire	Gah! My treasure! Stop that fire from reaching it! I don't care what else burns...just don't let the flames near my precious treasure! 
Number	Hey, I got my mitts on the combination to this lock. Just turn the dials to the correct numbers, and the treasure will be mine...eh, I mean, OURS. Heh heh, yeah right.
Slip	These guys are gonna fall if you don't do somethin'! Better straighten 'em up so they land on their feet. See how nice I am? Wario is the nicest! Tell all your friends!
BossChase	Hey! What's a toilet doin' in a place like this? Never mind. It's perfect timing. I was just thinking I needed to— Hey, don't run away! Where are you going? Waaaait!
WarioDX_Lock	You want to play this game? Yeah, well, you better binge more of the {color[#C313FF29]}Anything Goes{/color} level, then. Binge now, play this game later. That's how this works.

WC_SonicPenny	{[0201|CD00]}Go here! Go there! Go\nanywhere! The only rule is you\ngotta go there with {color[#14EDFF80]}Penny{/color}.\nSounds easy, right? Ha! The\nrecoil on her water blaster'll\nmove her in the opposite\ndirection you tilt that  thingy.\nTry mastering that and doing it\nsuper fast. Not so easy!
WC_Shoot	{[0201|CD00]}Bored? Then toss around the\ndisc with {color[#14EDFF80]}18-Volt {/color}to beat this set\nof games. Aim carefully if you\nwant to win. And if you don't\nwant to win, then what are you\neven doing here? Get out!
WC_MoveMountain	{[0201|CD00]}Hey, {color[#14EDFF80]}18-Volt{/color}! Get up off the\nground for once and make\nsome moves. I don't think he\ncan hear me. Guess it's up to\nyou to get that kid up and\naround in these challenges.\nI bet the tricky part'll be finding\nthe speediest route.
WC_IQ1	It's a battle of wits designed by\neveryone's favorite genius—me!\nWario! Use your brains (and\nthe right crew member) to\ncollect as many points as you\ncan. And hey! No cheating, OK?
WC_MotherChild	{[0201|CD00]}Get ready for some {color[#1DFFFF00]}Double Play{/color}\nwith the only mother-and-son\nduo I know—{color[#14EDFF80]}9-Volt{/color} and {color[#14EDFF80]}5-Volt{/color}!\nThey may be related, but their\ncontrols are way different.\nThis one's gonna take some\nquick thinking, so get ready!
WC_HardCharacter	Everyone in this crew of five\nhas a weird skill, so I put 'em\nall together. Lose a game, and\nthat crew member's gotta drop\nout. Keep playing until there's\nno one left to lose!
WC_Pair	{[0201|CD00]}Excited for a little {color[#1DFFFF00]}Double Play{/color}?\nGreat! Wanna pick the pairs?\nToo bad! That part's outta your\nhands. Remember to spread the\nlove. You'll lose if you focus on\nusing only one crew member.
WC_IQ_TA	This one's really tough! You\ngotta use your head AND the\npart of your body that tells time.\nThat's the...uh, whatever.\nSo choose your crew wisely,\n'cause wrong answers only lead\nto big-time disappointment.
WC_Burst	{[0201|CD00]}Pew pew pew! Watch out! You\nnever know what's coming your\nway when {color[#14EDFF80]}Ashley{/color}, {color[#14EDFF80]}Mike{/color}, and\n{color[#14EDFF80]}18-Volt{/color} get together. Keep your\neye on them...and the clock!\nAnd don't forget to aim.
WC_SuperWario	{[0201|CD00]}This one's a marathon, not a\nsprint! But, uh, you still gotta\nclear these {color[#5000FF06]}Super Mario World{/color}\ncourses as fast as possible.\nI chose the runners for you.\nYou gotta play to find out why.
WC_RingBrothers	{[0201|CD00]}What do {color[#14EDFF80]}9-Volt{/color}, {color[#14EDFF80]}18-Volt{/color}, and\n{color[#14EDFF80]}Pyoro{/color} have in common...other\nthan getting on my nerves?\nThey all play with rings!\nYou gotta aim for the shiny stuff\nin this timed challenge.
WC_Children	{[0201|CD00]}The children are the future?\nYeah right. Uh, unless you're\nabout to try this {color[#1DFFFF00]}Double Play{/color}\nthat pairs {color[#14EDFF80]}9-Volt {/color}with either {color[#14EDFF80]}Kat\n{/color}or {color[#14EDFF80]}Ana{/color}. Stay on your toes with\nthese kids. They're as tricky as\nthey are short.
WC_Kunoichi	{[0201|CD00]}It's a {color[#1DFFFF00]}Double Play{/color} with\n{color[#14EDFF80]}Kat & Ana{/color}! They jump. A lot.\nGood luck with that. Bwahaha!
WC_TaxiDriver	{[0201|CD00]}Time for a {color[#1DFFFF00]}Double Play{/color} with\n{color[#14EDFF80]}Dribble & Spitz{/color}! See how fast\nyou can go with these two in\nsync. Then see if they'll lend\nme a bazooka, OK?
WC_NintendoMania	{[0201|CD00]}I bet you think {color[#14EDFF80]}9-Volt{/color} and\n{color[#14EDFF80]}18-Volt{/color} are the perfect combo\nfor a {color[#1DFFFF00]}Double Play{/color}. Think again!\nTheir controls are as different\nas their shoe sizes! Bwahaha!
WC_Tutorial	{[0201|CD00]}Wanna be like me? Focus on\nthe easy stuff, and let everyone\nelse do the rest. If you can\nfigure out the right order to do\nstuff, this {color[#5000FF06]}Practice Controls\n{/color}challenge'll be super easy.
WC_Physics5W	You know about gravity? It's\npretty nice, and all these games\nuse it, which is pretty nice too.\nYou gotta increase your power\nto succeed in this challenge.\nPicking the right crew would\nalso be smart, but whatever.
WC_Yoyo	{[0201|CD00]}I guess yo-yos are cool now, so\nhere's a timed challenge that\nuses {color[#14EDFF80]}9-Volt{/color}'s yo-yo. If you\nwanna win games fast, then\ntime your {key[_BUTTON_A_]} presses just right.\nNo one likes a wasted yo-yo\nshot. Especially me.
WC_MoveMaiden	{[0201|CD00]}Can't choose between {color[#14EDFF80]}Ashley\n{/color}and {color[#14EDFF80]}Penny{/color}? Then don't. Switch\nbetween these two in this\nchallenge, and try not to get\ntoo confused. They seem like\ncomplete opposites, but so are\ntheir controls. Bwahaha!
WC_IQ2	Got brain power to spare?\nThen use it for these memory\nand observation games.\nThe key to winning is... Uh-oh.\nI forget. Eh, you'll be fine.
WC_BigPayout	This challenge is all about\nmoney and treasure and... Did\nsomeone just say "money"?!\nOh, I did. Choose the right crew\nfor these games, and don't get\ndistracted by all the money.\nMoney...it's so...money...
WC_OldMan	{[0201|CD00]}Prepare for a {color[#1DFFFF00]}Double Play{/color} with\n{color[#14EDFF80]}Crygor{/color} and {color[#14EDFF80]}Mantis{/color}. These two\nare always trying to teach me\nstuff. It's so annoying. Why\ndon't you go play with them\nand see if you learn anything.
WC_WaterChallenge	The first three rows will get wet!\nBwahaha! Just kidding. There's\nonly one row. And that's you.\nChoose the right crew for these\ngames, and try to score big!
WC_Danger	You like fire, spiky things, and\neven more spiky things? Ha!\nWell, I do. To get a high score\nin this challenge, you'll need\nmore than luck. You'll need a\nfireproof suit! If you don't have\none of those, just put together\nthe perfect crew instead.
WC_MorningNoonEvening	Want to see a day in the life of\nWario? Get in line! It's not easy,\nso think about who you want\nwith you if you're gonna spend\nsome time in my shoes. Even I\nthink they stink.
WC_InTheDark	This challenge starts off at high\nspeed and keeps going at high\nspeed. If you fail once, it's\ngame over. Getting nervous?\nLucky for you, all these games\nhave dark backgrounds and\nbright colors. Choose the right\ncrew, and this should be easy.
WC_OldBoy	This is a collection of games\nwith older guys doing stuff or\njust hanging out in the back.\n\n...\n\nHey! It's not easy to come up\nwith this stuff! Pick your crew\nand get a high score. Got it?
WC_Kawaii	These games look cute. Ha!\nDon't be fooled! You're gonna\nneed the right kind of crew to\ntake on this challenge. Then\njust aim for an adorably high\nscore. Like one with a lot of\nzeros in it or something.
WC_MakeClean	Eh, I don't get this challenge.\nClean stuff is overrated. Unlike\npicking a crew member that\ncan tidy up and do it fast.\nTake it from me. Choose right,\nand you'll never clean again!\nBwahaha!
WC_LikeWind	{[0201|CD00]}Having trouble moving the guy\nwith all the moves? Ha! In this\nchallenge, you gotta beat these\ngames super fast using {color[#14EDFF80]}Jimmy{/color}.\nOK, I'll give you one hint.\n{color[#14EDFF80]}Jimmy{/color}'s pose changes based\non the direction he's moving.\nSo think about the route.
WC_Destruction	Nine out of ten Warios agree\nthat breaking stuff is the best\nway to relieve stress. I dunno\nwhat's wrong with that other\nguy. Play this challenge with\nsomeone who's really good at\nbreaking stuff, and try to get\na really high score.
WC_AfroRibbon	{[0201|CD00]}{color[#14EDFF80]}Jimmy{/color} and {color[#14EDFF80]}Lulu{/color}? It's a weird\nmatchup for this {color[#1DFFFF00]}Double Play{/color}.\nDo you use them together or\none at a time? Hey, that's for\nyou to figure out. Just play the\ngames and decide for yourself!
WC_FireIce	Some like it cold. Some like it\nhot. I hope you pick a crew that\nlikes both, 'cause these games\nfeature fire AND ice. Don't let\nthe temperature changes slow\nyou down. The better you do,\nthe faster it goes!
WC_Avoid	Bwahaha! That's me, laughing\nat all the danger you're about\nto face. Put some thought into\nyour crew this time, OK?\nEspecially if you want a high\nscore. I plan on speeding things\nup and slowing them down\nrandomly in this challenge.
WC_Carry	Got a free hand? Or sixty?\nGood. Now try to carry all this\nstuff around. You can also push\nit, or shove it, or attack it.\nI don't care! As long as you\nand your crew can get it from\nhere to there, I'm happy.\nAnd if you get a high score,\nyou can be happy too.
WC_Save	The real challenge here is\ncaring enough to protect or\nrescue anything that's not\nmoney. Or me. Remember to\npick a good crew if you wanna\ncome out of this thing a hero.
WC_LikeRabbit	{[0201|CD00]}Rotate through {color[#14EDFF80]}Kat{/color}, {color[#14EDFF80]}Jimmy{/color}, and\n{color[#14EDFF80]}Lulu{/color} to beat these offbeat\ngames. The games are in a\nspecial order, but don't go\nthinking this'll be easy. You\ngotta memorize the order if you\nwant to finish quickly.
WC_NotFreeAgain	Some people say variety is the\nspice of life. I say it's a spice\nfor chumps. Play these games\nover and over again until you're\nthe fastest gamer of all time!\nOr at least this week.
WC_PyoroPyoro	{[0201|CD00]}Ever imagined hanging out with\ntwo {color[#14EDFF80]}Pyoros{/color} at once? It's not so\npretty. See for yourself in this\n{color[#1DFFFF00]}Double Play{/color} challenge.\nGet a high score while using\n{color[#14EDFF80]}Pyoro{/color} on the left AND right.\nHe attacks diagonally, so think\nextra hard about how to move\nhim...or is it hims?
WC_PeroPero	{[0201|CD00]}Ever imagined seeing two\n{color[#14EDFF80]}Pyoros{/color} at once? Spoiler alert.\nIt's just as creepy in real life.\nFor this {color[#1DFFFF00]}Double Play{/color} challenge,\nget the fastest time using {color[#14EDFF80]}Pyoro\n{/color}on the left AND the right.\nHe attacks diagonally, so think\nabout how to get the most use\nout of those tongues.
WC_AbilityTest	I'm gonna throw every game\nI've got at you! Beat as many as\nyou can, but think hard about\nwho you put in your crew.\n'Cause as soon as one of those\nchumps fail, they're out for\ngood. Well, uh...until you start\nall over again.
WC_VSBigPyoro	{[0201|CD00]}{[0201|CD00]}Forget wits! This is a battle of\nspeed against a giant {color[#14EDFF80]}Pyoro{/color}.\nThat's the scariest kind! Beat\n{color[#5000FF06]}Showdown{/color} as fast as you can,\nand if you lose...you lose it all.
WC_VSBigPyoroMD	{[0201|CD00]}It's a {color[#5000FF06]}Showdown{/color} {color[#1DFFFF00]}Double Play{/color}!\nUse two of the same crew\nmember to beat the giant\n{color[#14EDFF80]}Pyoro{/color}. They say a good offense\nis the best defense. It's also a\ngood offense. Just something\nto think about while you do this.
WC_FeelGood	I picked out all the easiest\ngames and then sped them up\nsuper fast! Beating this\nchallenge should be easy peasy\nif you can stay calm and have a\nwell-planned crew.
WC_PushPull	Up, down, sideways, and, uh...\nthe opposite of sideways!\nIn this challenge, you're gonna\npush stuff, including yourself!\nSo grab your crew, and aim for\nthe highest score ever!
WC_Collection	I love collecting money, but\neverything else is just eh.\nSo you're gonna collect that\nstuff instead. Grab it, shoot it,\nsave it in a vacuum-sealed box\nif you want. With the right crew,\nanything's possible.
WC_RedDevilBlueRobot	{[0201|CD00]}Don't overthink this {color[#1DFFFF00]}Double Play\n{/color}challenge with {color[#14EDFF80]}Red {/color}and {color[#14EDFF80]}Mike{/color}.\nOne drops stuff from above,\nthe other shoots stuff from\nbelow. You gotta figure out\nhow to do both, and fast!
WC_Timing	{[0201|CD00]}{color[#14EDFF80]}Kat{/color} and {color[#14EDFF80]}9-Volt{/color}... Oy, do those\ntwo ever sit still? No! That's why\nthey're perfect for a challenge\nlike this. Want a hint? You gotta\nmaster the timing to master the\nscore with this set of games.
WC_Chance	{[0201|CD00]}I must be going soft, 'cause\nthese games are always gonna\nshow up in the same order.\nKnow what? I'm gonna make it\nextra fast! Bwahaha! Just to\nkeep it interesting. Watch that\n{color[#14EDFF80]}9-Volt{/color}'s skateboard closely, and\npractice those yo-yo shots to\nachieve perfection here.
WC_IQSpeed	Think fast! Literally. That's the\nwhole point of this challenge.\nAnswer lots of questions in a\nshort amount of time. Pick the\nright crew member, and it'll be\neasier. You should know that\nby now!
WC_AllStars	If three's a crowd, then 20 is\na circus! The one thing you got\ngoing for you here is that\neverybody's game stays the\nsame in this challenge. Keep it\nall straight, and you'll have a\nhigh score in no time.
WC_RotationShakeString	In this collection of games, you\nturn and shake stuff! Sound too\nsimple for you? Ha! You better\naim carefully and watch your\ntiming or you won't get a high\nscore. So, which member of my\ncrew you gonna pick?
