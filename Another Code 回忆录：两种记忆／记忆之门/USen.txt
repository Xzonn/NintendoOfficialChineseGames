AC1_1_Scenario_Text_00097	The hedges are overgrown with lush weeds.
AC1_1_Scenario_Text_00098	I can't see a thing... The curtains\nmust be closed.
AC1_1_Scenario_Text_00099	It's too dark to see inside the mansion.
AC1_1_Scenario_Text_00073	The gate is locked.
AC1_1_Scenario_Text_00074	No good. It won't open. But I'm\nsure Jessica is through here...
AC1_1_Scenario_Text_00075	How can I reach the path that\nleads to those stairs?
AC1_1_Scenario_Text_00100	I need to get to that mansion.
AC1_1_Scenario_Text_00076	I can see the mansion from here.
AC1_1_Scenario_Text_00085	I can finally get into the\nmansion.
AC1_1_00962	Blood Edward Island\n1948
AC1_1_00963	Thomas, why?!
AC1_1_00964	Father?
AC1_1_00965	*gasp*
AC1_1_00966	Seattle Suburbs\n1994
AC1_1_00967	Hurry, Ashley! Hide!
AC1_1_00968	What do you hope to accomplish?!
AC1_1_00969	Mommy?
AC1_1_00974	Blood Edward Island\n2005
AC1_1_01081	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_00975	If I follow this path...
AC1_1_00976	I can get to the mansion.
AC1_1_01082	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_00977	Watch out!
AC1_1_00978	What?
AC1_1_01083	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_01084	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_00979	No going back now... What should I do?
AC1_1_01085	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_00980	Ah!
AC1_1_00981	This is the way to the mansion.
AC1_1_01065	All right, now I can get across!
AC1_1_00984	What's this?
AC1_1_00985	Only Edward family members permitted\npast this point.
AC1_1_00986	Edward... The captain mentioned that name.
AC1_1_00988	What?!
AC1_1_01095	A few hours earlier...
AC1_1_00989	Off the coast of Seattle\nFeb. 24, 2005
AC1_1_00044	*sob*
AC1_1_00046	Ashley!
AC1_1_00565	*inhale*
AC1_1_00055	Dad...
AC1_1_00058	Hey!
AC1_1_01094	(exert noise)
AC1_1_00060	Look alive. We're almost there.
AC1_1_00063	Hmm?
AC1_1_00937	*inhale*
AC1_1_00064	...
AC1_1_00936	*exhale*
AC1_1_00067	Whoa!
AC1_1_00938	...
AC1_1_00070	So that's Blood Edward Island?
AC1_1_00072	Right you are, miss.
AC1_1_00073	That's our destination.
AC1_1_00074	Used to get more than two visitors at once.
AC1_1_00076	Not much call for a ferryman there now.
AC1_1_00939	*exhale*
AC1_1_00078	Anyway. Your business is your own,\nof course.
AC1_1_00080	But I'm sure curious what calls you out here.
AC1_1_00083	The day before my 14th birthday\nstarted off pretty bad.
AC1_1_00085	On the boat, the waters were calm.
AC1_1_00086	But inside, I felt tossed in a storm.
AC1_1_00087	I was so excited.
AC1_1_00088	But also lost and angry.
AC1_1_00089	I've never felt so torn apart.
AC1_1_00090	Who could blame me?
AC1_1_00091	I mean, my dad...
AC1_1_00092	I always thought he was dead.
AC1_1_00093	But he's alive!
AC1_1_00095	I received a package a few days ago.
AC1_1_00096	It didn't say who it was from...
AC1_1_00097	But there were two things inside:
AC1_1_00098	a letter from Dad, who I thought\ndied when I was three,
AC1_1_00099	and this strange device
AC1_1_00958	that looks like a game system.
AC1_1_00100	Now here I am,
AC1_1_00101	rereading the letter on a boat with my aunt...
AC1_1_00102	heading to Blood Edward Island where\nmy dad is supposed to be waiting.
AC1_1_00104	Jessica! Hey!
AC1_1_00106	Oh, good. You're awake.
AC1_1_00110	Come feel the breeze. It's nice.
AC1_1_00112	Yeah. Nice.
AC1_1_00113	What's wrong? Feeling seasick?
AC1_1_00115	Nah. I'm all right.
AC1_1_00116	Are you sure?
AC1_1_00117	Mm-hmm.
AC1_1_00118	Let me guess. You had the\ndream again?
AC1_1_00119	Yeah...
AC1_1_00120	I don't know why I keep having it.\nIt always ends the same.
AC1_1_00121	And no matter how hard I try,\nI can't remember Dad's face.
AC1_1_00122	Don't rack your brain too hard.\nYou were so little back then.
AC1_1_00123	Besides, you'll see him in person\nsoon. So cheer up.
AC1_1_00124	...I guess.
AC1_1_00127	Jessica is Dad's little sister. She's\nall the family I have left.
AC1_1_00129	She's raised me since I was little,\nand on a high-school chem\nteacher's salary.
AC1_1_00130	Don't get me wrong, she's been\nreally nice.
AC1_1_00131	She always considers what's best\nfor me and helps me out when I\nneed it.
AC1_1_00132	Now though... I don't know.
AC1_1_00134	Why did you never tell me Dad\nwas alive?
AC1_1_00135	Why have you been lying to me\nall this time?!
AC1_1_00136	That's— I mean—
AC1_1_00137	I promised your dad.
AC1_1_00138	Promised him what?
AC1_1_00140	It was 11 years ago.
AC1_1_00142	Richard showed up one day
AC1_1_00960	holding you. You'd just turned three.
AC1_1_00143	It was so sudden. I could tell something was\nwrong. He said,
AC1_1_00144	"Look after her. I'll be back for her someday.
AC1_1_00145	"But...until you hear from me again...
AC1_1_00961	"it's best if you tell her I'm dead."
AC1_1_00147	Why would he say that?
AC1_1_00148	He didn't tell me.
AC1_1_00149	I bet he wanted nothing to do\nwith me after Mom died.
AC1_1_00150	No! It wasn't like that!
AC1_1_00151	Oh, uh—
AC1_1_00152	My brother's a good man. Please,\ntrust that he had his reasons.
AC1_1_00153	He's not the kind of man who'd\nabandon his child if there was\nany other option.
AC1_1_00154	I remember the warmth in his\neyes as he looked at you...
AC1_1_00155	When I saw that, I knew I had to\ntake care of you until he came\nback home.
AC1_1_00156	*sigh*
AC1_1_00157	I'm so sorry, Ashley. I wanted to\ntell you sooner.
AC1_1_00160	So...what was he like? My dad.
AC1_1_00161	Well...
AC1_1_00162	Richard is a brilliant\nneuroscientist.
AC1_1_00163	He was...is...a neuroscientist?\nLike, he studied brains?
AC1_1_00164	Yeah. And I bet he made that\n<color=#00994CFF>device </color>he sent you.
AC1_1_00165	Really? He made this?
AC1_1_00167	OK, that's kind of amazing.
AC1_1_00168	What exactly did he study?
AC1_1_00170	His focus was on memory.
AC1_1_00171	Memory. Huh.
AC1_1_00173	He worked for a leading\nneuroscience research center.
AC1_1_00174	Talented scientists from all over\nthe world came together there.
AC1_1_00175	He met a scientist from Japan,\nand they fell in love.
AC1_1_00176	Before long, they got married.
AC1_1_00177	You're talking about...
AC1_1_00178	Right. Sayoko.
AC1_1_00179	She was your <color=#00994CFF>mother</color>.
AC1_1_00182	So Dad sent me this.
AC1_1_00183	It says...D, A, S.
AC1_1_00184	DAS? What do you think that\nstands for?
AC1_1_00185	Don't know. What's this\ncamera icon?
AC1_1_00188	Huh. It works.
AC1_1_00189	Uh...
AC1_1_00190	Now how do I look at the picture\nI took?
AC1_1_00192	Not bad.
AC1_1_00194	Could you take one of me next?
AC1_1_00195	Sorry, but no. You're the only\none who can use that thing.
AC1_1_00196	What? Why?
AC1_1_00197	I had spent some time fiddling\nwith it after it arrived.
AC1_1_00198	Seems like it's keyed to your \ngenetic data using <color=#00994CFF>biometrics</color>.
AC1_1_00199	Bio...whatrics?
AC1_1_00201	Biometric systems read a\nperson's unique attributes.
AC1_1_00202	They can use those unique\nidentifiers as a sort of key.
AC1_1_00203	Your DAS seems to have a\nsystem like that built in.
AC1_1_00204	Meaning it won't work for\nanyone but you.
AC1_1_00206	Huh. So it'll only work for me...
AC1_1_00209	Can you...tell me more\nabout Mom?
AC1_1_00210	Sayoko had a powerful mind...and\nan equally powerful will.
AC1_1_00211	She had beautiful eyes too.
AC1_1_00212	That's where you get yours.\nThey look just like hers.
AC1_1_00213	That's not what I mean!
AC1_1_00214	I want to hear real stuff.
AC1_1_00215	Like...what?
AC1_1_00216	Just tell me the truth about her.
AC1_1_00217	Whatever it is, I can handle it.
AC1_1_00218	And I won't be mad.
AC1_1_00219	I just want to know about Mom.
AC1_1_00220	*sigh*
AC1_1_00221	I always thought Mom died along\nwith Dad.
AC1_1_00222	Since it turns out Dad's alive...\nThat means Mom is too, right?
AC1_1_00223	Is she on the island with him?
AC1_1_00224	You can tell me!
AC1_1_00225	Ashley...
AC1_1_00226	That's something you'll have to\nask Richard about.
AC1_1_00227	You'll get all the answers you're\nlooking for when you meet him.
AC1_1_00228	Great. Thanks.
AC1_1_00232	Sorry to interrupt, but we're\nalmost there.
AC1_1_00235	He's not here...
AC1_1_00237	Wasn't someone supposed to\nmeet you here?
AC1_1_00239	Strange. I wonder if something\ncame up.
AC1_1_00240	Richard should be here.
AC1_1_00242	I changed my mind. I'm not going.
AC1_1_00243	Ashley...
AC1_1_00244	Why isn't Dad here?
AC1_1_00245	He's the one who told me to come\nto this island. So where is he?!
AC1_1_00247	What, is he too busy? I bet he\ndoesn't want to see me after all.
AC1_1_00249	*sigh*
AC1_1_00251	'Scuse me.
AC1_1_00253	No offense, but I have other\npassengers today.
AC1_1_00254	I'm going back to the mainland in\na bit, if that's all right with you.
AC1_1_00255	Yes, that's fine.
AC1_1_00256	Well then, I'll be back by evening\nto pick you up as planned.
AC1_1_00257	Got it. Thank you.
AC1_1_00259	Why don't you wait here. I'll go\nfind your father.
AC1_1_00262	I'll be right back.
AC1_1_01029	...
AC1_1_00313	Your mom looked worried.
AC1_1_00315	Jessica's not my mom.
AC1_1_00316	What is she, then? Your sister?
AC1_1_00319	No. Jessica's my aunt.\nShe raised me.
AC1_1_00320	My dad bailed, left me with her.
AC1_1_00321	I thought he was dead until I got\nthis letter.
AC1_1_00323	Hold on now.
AC1_1_00324	What?
AC1_1_00325	It's clear you're working through\nsome things right now.
AC1_1_00326	And I'm not one to meddle in\nother people's business.
AC1_1_00327	Are you sure you wouldn't rather\ngo off with your aunt?
AC1_1_00328	It doesn't matter.
AC1_1_00333	So long as we're waiting, why\ndon't we have a little chat, hmm?
AC1_1_00334	Sure, but...what's there to\nchat about?
AC1_1_00335	Well...we could talk about<color=#00994CFF>\nthis island</color>.
AC1_1_00337	Can we talk <color=#00994CFF>about you</color>?
AC1_1_00339	Ask away. I'll answer whatever\nI can.
AC1_1_00342	So, how long have you been\na captain?
AC1_1_00343	Since well before you were born.
AC1_1_00344	Cool. That long, huh?
AC1_1_00345	Hahaha.
AC1_1_00346	Why a captain?
AC1_1_00347	Was it your childhood dream?
AC1_1_00348	Who can say?
AC1_1_00349	Didn't you ever wanna be\nanything else?
AC1_1_00350	Maybe so. Can't say for sure. It's\nbeen quite a while since I've\nthought about it.
AC1_1_00351	Huh.
AC1_1_00352	Is it normal to forget the past\nas you get older?
AC1_1_00353	Nah. You forget what you want\nto forget.
AC1_1_00354	Isn't there anything you want to\nhold on to?
AC1_1_00355	Of course there is.
AC1_1_00356	Your heart keeps all the really\nprecious memories locked away.
AC1_1_00357	The heart remembers, huh?
AC1_1_00358	Right. You might think those\nimportant memories are lost.
AC1_1_00359	But your heart can always set\na course back to them.
AC1_1_00360	...All right.
AC1_1_00363	No one lives here, right?
AC1_1_00364	Not these days.
AC1_1_00365	So there used to be people here?
AC1_1_00366	They say it was once home to a\nfamily of rich folks.
AC1_1_00367	But the patriarch got sick, and\nthings went from bad to worse.
AC1_1_00368	Why? What happened?
AC1_1_00369	Most of the family died, one\nright after the next.
AC1_1_00370	*wince*
AC1_1_00371	How did they die?
AC1_1_00372	Couldn't tell you.
AC1_1_00373	Was it one big tragedy or a\nbunch of little accidents?
AC1_1_00374	Hold on now. I get that it can be\ntempting to dig into something\nlike this...
AC1_1_00375	But take a lesson from me: Don't\ngo meddling in other people's\nbusiness.
AC1_1_00376	Even if you got to the bottom of\nit all, what do the dead care?
AC1_1_00377	*sigh*
AC1_1_00378	Anyway, the whole thing drove\nwhat was left of them away.
AC1_1_00379	So now the place is deserted.
AC1_1_00380	Some heartless folks started\ncalling it "Blood-Soaked\nEdward Island."
AC1_1_00381	But I guess that doesn't quite roll\noff the tongue, because now it's\njust Blood Edward Island.
AC1_1_00382	Well, that explains that.
AC1_1_00383	Do you come to this island a lot?
AC1_1_00384	Hardly.
AC1_1_00385	It's rare that anyone feels the\nneed to come out this way.
AC1_1_00386	Though, I did recently ferry a\ntall, blond man here...
AC1_1_00387	Wait, really?
AC1_1_00388	When was this? What was\nhis name?
AC1_1_00389	Aren't we a nosy one!
AC1_1_00390	I mean, this could be my dad\nwe're talking about.
AC1_1_00391	Sorry, miss, but that's all you're\ngetting out of me.
AC1_1_00392	I don't talk about my passengers,\nand I'll hold firm on that.
AC1_1_00393	OK...
AC1_1_00990	Hmm?
AC1_1_00991	Isn't that your aunt?
AC1_1_00992	Huh?
AC1_1_00993	Oh, yeah.
AC1_1_00994	Shouldn't you go?
AC1_1_00995	Uh... Right.
AC1_1_00996	See you later!
AC1_1_00418	What the... Are you kidding me?
AC1_1_00420	Don't tell me it's locked.
AC1_1_00422	Yep. Just my luck.
AC1_1_00432	*gasp*
AC1_1_00434	He left...
AC1_1_00436	He actually left me here.
AC1_1_00438	Now what?
AC1_1_00443	*sigh*
AC1_1_00444	Well, doesn't this suck.
AC1_1_00447	Stupid old stool...
AC1_1_00457	Why am I just sitting here? I need\nto hurry and find Jessica!
AC1_1_00463	Huh?
AC1_1_00464	What's that jingling?
AC1_1_01067	Nice, got it!
AC1_1_01068	But what's this key for?
AC1_1_00468	Yes!
AC1_1_00997	Jessica must be up ahead...
AC1_1_00998	Sure are a lot of old buildings.\nMust have been a bunch of\npeople here at one point.
AC1_1_00999	That's...
AC1_1_00495	Aaaah!
AC1_1_00497	Was that a scream?!
AC1_1_01000	What was that?!
AC1_1_00499	Jessica!
AC1_1_00500	JESSICA!
AC1_1_01072	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_01073	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_00528	Oh, hey.
AC1_1_00529	The garden here leads to some\nstairs.
AC1_1_00530	I bet I can take those stairs to\nthe mansion.
AC1_1_00531	Question is, how do I get there?
AC1_1_01079	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_01074	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_01075	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_01003	Phew! I made it.
AC1_1_01004	Huh?!
AC1_1_00534	Is this what I think it is?
AC1_1_00538	Nice! It's open!
AC1_1_00541	Huh?
AC1_1_00543	Not going anywhere with this\nrock in the way.
AC1_1_00545	Am I gonna have to move this\nthing by myself?
AC1_1_00548	*grunt*
AC1_1_00549	It's so...heavy...
AC1_1_00551	*exhale*
AC1_1_00554	"D"? Is this...someone's grave?
AC1_1_00555	It looks different from the others.
AC1_1_00559	Now what?
AC1_1_00561	Gah.
AC1_1_01088	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_00942	...
AC1_1_01089	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_00569	Is someone there?
AC1_1_00571	You...
AC1_1_00578	Who said that?! Stop hiding!
AC1_1_00580	You...can hear what I say?
AC1_1_00581	Of course I can hear you!
AC1_1_00582	Quit playing around! This isn't funny!
AC1_1_00584	I'm not playing.
AC1_1_01087	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_01090	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_01091	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_01092	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_01093	(Exert Noise)
AC1_1_00588	*gasp*
AC1_1_00590	...
AC1_1_00592	...
AC1_1_00594	...
AC1_1_00602	Sooo...
AC1_1_00604	Gaah!
AC1_1_00605	Excuse me...
AC1_1_00606	Wh-what—what do you want?!
AC1_1_00607	I just want to know your name.
AC1_1_00608	A-Ashley!
AC1_1_00609	Your name is "A-Ashley"?
AC1_1_00610	Uh, no.
AC1_1_00611	J-just...Ashley.
AC1_1_00612	Ashley Mizuki Robins.
AC1_1_00613	So I should call you Ashley.
AC1_1_00615	Please don't hurt me!
AC1_1_00616	I don't wanna die! I'm still young!
AC1_1_00619	Don't be afraid, Ashley. I don't\nmean you any harm.
AC1_1_00620	Please, open your eyes.\nLook at me.
AC1_1_01005	OK, OK. I'm opening my eyes, and\nI'm seeing... I'm seeing...
AC1_1_01006	A ghost?!
AC1_1_00622	Ashley, can you...see me?
AC1_1_00623	Uh...y-yeah.
AC1_1_00624	You're not just saying so?
AC1_1_00625	I said I see you!
AC1_1_00627	You can see me!
AC1_1_00629	Hahaha!
AC1_1_00630	Hahahahaha!
AC1_1_00631	Oh no, now it's laughing. Wh-why\nis the ghost laughing? Why is\nthere a ghost to begin with?!
AC1_1_00632	I'm so freaked out right now.\nWhat's so funny?!
AC1_1_00634	I'm laughing because I'm happy.
AC1_1_00635	About what?
AC1_1_00636	I've been waiting so long for this.
AC1_1_00637	So, so long...
AC1_1_00638	For <color=#00994CFF>someone like you</color>.
AC1_1_00640	What do you mean, someone\nlike me?
AC1_1_00641	All this time, I've been hoping for\nsomeone who could see me.
AC1_1_00642	Well, you got your wish—a person\nwho can see you.
AC1_1_00643	And that's a big problem for me!
AC1_1_00644	I never wanted to meet a...a... I-I\nmean, you're—you're totally a...
AC1_1_00645	A ghost.
AC1_1_00646	I was afraid you'd say that...
AC1_1_00647	Don't be afraid.
AC1_1_00648	My name is, um... It's...D.
AC1_1_00649	"D"? Kind of a weird name for a\nghost, isn't it?
AC1_1_00651	Oh, I can't believe it. I'm really\ntalking to a ghost.
AC1_1_00657	I bet this is all because I moved\nthat rock.
AC1_1_00658	It probably disturbed the ghost's\nresting place.
AC1_1_00659	Man...what am I gonna do?
AC1_1_00660	That's...not quite right.
AC1_1_00661	What?
AC1_1_00662	That's not my grave.
AC1_1_00663	My body isn't buried under\nthat stone.
AC1_1_00664	It isn't?
AC1_1_00665	I've been here for a long time,\nbut no one's ever noticed me.
AC1_1_00666	I've been alone for so long.
AC1_1_00667	You've been here all alone?
AC1_1_00668	Yes.
AC1_1_00669	You're not the first to visit\nthis spot.
AC1_1_00670	But none of the others ever\nrealized I was here.
AC1_1_00672	Why not?
AC1_1_00673	I don't know.
AC1_1_00674	But you're finally here. The first\nperson who can see me.
AC1_1_00675	That's why I know you're the one.
AC1_1_00676	The...one?
AC1_1_00677	The one who can help me<color=#00994CFF> regain\nmy memories</color>.
AC1_1_00688	What do you mean, regain your\nmemories?
AC1_1_00690	Ashley, I...don't remember\nanything about my life.
AC1_1_00691	Not a single thing.
AC1_1_00692	*gasp*
AC1_1_00693	Who I am, how I died...
AC1_1_00694	It's all a blank to me.
AC1_1_00695	I think that's why I'm still here.
AC1_1_00696	Why I've been cursed to wander\nhere for so long...
AC1_1_00697	How long are we talking here?
AC1_1_00698	Uh...57 years. If I haven't\nlost count.
AC1_1_00699	You've been here for 57 years?!
AC1_1_00700	Is it that surprising?
AC1_1_00701	Uh, yeah. Because 57 years is\nold enough to be a grandpa.
AC1_1_00702	I suppose that's true.
AC1_1_00703	It's also a really long time to be\nalone. I can't imagine...
AC1_1_00704	Yeah...
AC1_1_00705	That's why it's so important that\nI regain my lost memories.
AC1_1_00706	I want to get back all I've lost.
AC1_1_00707	I can kind of sympathize. About\nnot remembering stuff, I mean.
AC1_1_00712	But you can't remember anything\nat all, D?
AC1_1_00713	*sigh*
AC1_1_00714	Not even a single detail?
AC1_1_00715	There is <color=#00994CFF>something</color>. It's not much,\nbut it's there.
AC1_1_00719	What do you remember?
AC1_1_00720	I remember that someone once\ncalled me D...
AC1_1_00721	and this mark on my chest.
AC1_1_00722	What is that, anyway?
AC1_1_00723	It's the last thing I ever saw.
AC1_1_00724	It was burnt into my mind at the\nmoment of my death.
AC1_1_00725	Hmm.
AC1_1_00726	The mark is my biggest clue.
AC1_1_00727	If I figure out what it is...I may\nunderstand how and why I died.
AC1_1_00728	I have to know, Ashley.
AC1_1_00733	I need to get my memories back.
AC1_1_00734	Searching this island is my best\nchance, but I need your help.
AC1_1_01007	Help you? But...
AC1_1_00735	I don't know...
AC1_1_00736	I mean, I don't even know if I can\ndo anything to help.
AC1_1_00737	I think you can.
AC1_1_00738	If nothing else, you can see and\nhear me.
AC1_1_00739	I've waited 57 years for\nthat much.
AC1_1_00740	Please, Ashley.
AC1_1_00741	Help me remember.
AC1_1_00742	D...
AC1_1_00743	What should I do?
AC1_1_00744	I don't wanna just leave him here.
AC1_1_00745	But I've got my own problems.\nI need to find Jessica.
AC1_1_00746	And I've got to be back at the\ndock tonight for my ride home.
AC1_1_00747	Plus, on top of all that...
AC1_1_00748	I still really wanna see my dad.
AC1_1_00752	Listen, D.
AC1_1_00753	I came to this island to see\nmy dad.
AC1_1_00754	The same dad that Jessica's been\ntelling me was dead all my life.
AC1_1_00755	Your father? Dead?
AC1_1_00756	I got mad at Jessica. Then she\nwent off by herself, and now\nI'm all alone.
AC1_1_00757	I should have been honest and\ntold her I want to see my dad.
AC1_1_00758	Dad...
AC1_1_00759	Uh, yeah.
AC1_1_00760	What I'm trying to say is...I need\nto go see him.
AC1_1_00761	So...sorry, D.
AC1_1_00762	...
AC1_1_00763	I can't help you. I just...don't\nhave time.
AC1_1_00765	Father...
AC1_1_00766	D? Is...something wrong?
AC1_1_00767	Father?
AC1_1_00768	...
AC1_1_00772	I grew up in this house.
AC1_1_01008	Father!
AC1_1_00789	...
AC1_1_00790	You OK?
AC1_1_00791	I...
AC1_1_00793	D?
AC1_1_00797	Weird...
AC1_1_00799	Is he mad at me?
AC1_1_00800	But it's not my fault.
AC1_1_00801	I have to find Jessica.
AC1_1_00804	Here goes.
AC1_1_01009	All right, I should be able to get\ninto the mansion from here.
AC1_1_01012	Huh?
AC1_1_01011	What's that sparkle?
AC1_1_01014	These are...
AC1_1_01015	Jessica's glasses?!
AC1_1_01017	That must mean Jessica made it\nhere after all.
AC1_1_00810	Another locked door. Now what?
AC1_1_01018	These are some intense door\nknockers.
AC1_1_00812	Ashley...
AC1_1_00814	D?!
AC1_1_01019	So this is where you went.
AC1_1_00815	What happened? You just up and\ndisappeared.
AC1_1_00816	I thought you were mad at me.
AC1_1_00817	Mad? Why would I be mad?
AC1_1_00818	Because I said I couldn't help you.
AC1_1_00819	Oh, no, I wasn't angry.
AC1_1_00820	What you said helped me\n<color=#00994CFF>remember something</color>.
AC1_1_00822	That memory led me here.
AC1_1_00825	So what did you remember?
AC1_1_00826	My father.
AC1_1_00827	I remembered a bit about him.
AC1_1_00829	It's been so long since I could\nremember anything at all.
AC1_1_00830	But then you spoke of wanting to\nsee your dad.
AC1_1_00831	When I heard that, a few things\nsuddenly came back to me.
AC1_1_00832	I know I was with my father when\nI first <color=#00994CFF>came to this mansion</color>.
AC1_1_00836	Then...were you a visitor here?\nLike me?
AC1_1_00837	Where were you and your dad\nfrom originally?
AC1_1_00838	That...I don't know.
AC1_1_00843	Although...
AC1_1_00844	I'm starting to remember a little\nbit about my time at the mansion.
AC1_1_00845	I thought seeing the inside of it\nmight jog my memory more.
AC1_1_00851	Can you open this door?
AC1_1_00853	I can't. I already tried, it's locked.
AC1_1_00854	I was hoping to get inside so I\ncan look for Jessica.
AC1_1_00855	You mentioned this Jessica\nbefore. Who is she?
AC1_1_00856	She's my aunt. She raised me.
AC1_1_00857	She may be in trouble somewhere\ninside.
AC1_1_00858	Wait, aren't you a ghost? Can't\nyou pass through walls?
AC1_1_00862	Nope. I can't even wiggle the\ndoor knockers.
AC1_1_01020	*gasp*
AC1_1_00866	I grew up in this house.
AC1_1_00870	Fortunately for us, I know the\nsecret to these door knockers.
AC1_1_01021	I just remembered what my\nfather said about this door...
AC1_1_01022	He told you something about this\ndoor specifically?
AC1_1_01023	Yeah! I remember now!
AC1_1_01024	He said, "I know the secret to\nthese door knockers."
AC1_1_01025	Ashley...
AC1_1_01026	If you can figure out the secret,\nwe can get inside!
AC1_1_01027	You want me to figure it out?
AC1_1_00886	Oh!
AC1_1_00887	Well, what do you know?
AC1_1_00892	Jessica has got to be somewhere inside.
AC1_1_00893	Dad too, I guess.
AC1_1_00896	*exhale*
AC1_1_00898	Huh?
AC1_1_00899	What's wrong, D?
AC1_1_00900	I've waited for this moment...for so long...
AC1_1_00901	I can't help being nervous.
AC1_1_00902	Hehehe.
AC1_1_00903	Er...pardon?
AC1_1_00904	Who ever heard of a nervous ghost?
AC1_1_00946	*giggle*
AC1_1_00905	I guess that is a little funny.
AC1_1_00906	You're the least scary ghost I've ever met.
AC1_1_00908	Hey, D. How about we team up?
AC1_1_00909	...
AC1_1_00910	I think I can help get your memories back.
AC1_1_00911	And in return...will you help me find Jessica?
AC1_1_00912	Yes. That's fair.
AC1_1_00913	Then into the mansion we go.
AC1_1_00914	What could scare the two of us together?
AC1_1_00915	Right.
AC1_1_00916	Can't believe I've made friends with a ghost...
AC1_1_00959	What a day.
AC1_1_00917	We're friends?
AC1_1_00918	Aren't we?
AC1_1_00919	You're right. Friends it is.
AC1_1_00920	Glad to hear it.
AC1_1_00922	C'mon, D!
AC1_1_00924	I made a friend.
AC1_1_01031	Hey, D... I know you have trouble\nremembering things, but...
AC1_1_01032	Does this remind you of\nanything?
AC1_1_01033	Hmm, let's see... Oh, right.
AC1_1_01035	Come along this way. Let's\nget ourselves inside.
AC1_1_01036	*knock knock knock\n      knock knock knock*
AC1_1_01037	The secret to these door\nknockers?
AC1_1_01040	Hey, D... I know you have trouble\nremembering things, but...
AC1_1_01041	Has anything come back to\nyou yet?
AC1_1_01042	Hmm...
AC1_1_01044	Come along this way. Let's\nget ourselves inside.
AC1_1_01045	*knock knock knock\n      knock knock knock*
AC1_1_01046	There's a clue in the game\nyou were just playing.
AC1_1_01047	A clue in the game?
AC1_1_01048	Yes. I was playing on those tiles.
AC1_1_01049	I see... Um, anything else?
AC1_1_01050	Hmm... Sorry. I can't remember\nanything else.
AC1_Mystery_1_1_00025	Was that a bell I just heard?
AC1_Mystery_1_1_00026	Let's check it again.
AC1_Mystery_1_1_00047	What's a key doing here?
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00001	Whose grave is this?
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00002	Chiseled into the old tombstone:
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00003	Henry Edward\n1910 - 1948
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00004	Henry Edward...
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00092	Chiseled into the old tombstone:
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00093	Henry Edward\n1910 - 1948
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00009	Whose grave is this?
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00010	Chiseled into the old tombstone:
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00011	Thomas Edward\n1912 - 1948
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00012	Thomas Edward...
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00013	Huh?
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00015	There's a hole in this\ntombstone.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00016	Chiseled into the old tombstone:
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00017	Thomas Edward\n1912 - 1948
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00018	A single bird is engraved into the gravestone.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00096	Hm...
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00097	This one has a hole too.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00098	What could it mean?
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00019	I wonder when this tombstone\nwas made.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00020	Chiseled into the old tombstone:
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00021	Lawrence Edward\n1868 - 1948
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00022	Lawrence Edward...
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00025	Chiseled into the old tombstone:
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00026	Lawrence Edward\n1868 - 1948
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00027	There's a picture of birds holding sprouts\ncarved under the name.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00101	Huh?
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00102	There's a chunk missing from the\ncenter. What happened to it?
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00103	Huh?
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00104	There's a chunk missing from the\ncenter. What happened to it?
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00105	What could this mean?
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00036	It fit!
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00037	The shapes don't match.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00040	The shapes don't match.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00041	It fit!
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00043	There's a stone fragment.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00044	Who put this here?
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00048	There's a pair of pruning shears on the ground.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00049	They look pretty rusty. I can't\nuse them like this.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00055	There's a tombstone.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00056	I can't make out what it says.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00057	The wood has rotted away.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00058	It's dark, but I think I see\nsomething in there...
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00059	I think I can reach it.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00063	Just a...little farther...
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00064	What's this?
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00067	There's a rusty handle.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00068	Ugh, no use. It won't open.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00069	There's an old broom.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00070	I wonder how long it's been\nstanding here.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00108	There's an assortment of gardening tools.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00109	Has someone been using these\nto take care of the grounds?
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00110	There's an assortment of gardening tools.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00074	It's locked.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00075	How does it open?
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00076	The gate is locked.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00077	Maybe I can open it with this.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00078	It won't open...
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00079	No good. It won't open.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00080	How do I line up the lock's discs\nto open it?
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00081	No use. It won't open.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00082	Do these discs need to be lined\nup in a certain way?
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00083	I should take another look\naround here.
AC1_Mystery_1_2_00089	The gate can't open with this\nrock here.
AC1_Mystery_1_3_00056	How can I open it?
AC1_Mystery_1_3_00057	It's not opening. I'll try again.
AC1_Mystery_1_3_00058	It won't open. I should go talk to\nD again.
AC1_Mystery_1_3_00059	It's not opening.
AC1_Mystery_1_3_00060	There must be something around\nhere that'll give me a hint.
AC1_2_Scenario_00002	Oh, D. There you are.
AC1_2_Scenario_00003	This person...
AC1_2_Scenario_00009	I can't do this without D.
AC1_2_Scenario_00010	There's a portrait of Lawrence,\nhead of the Edward Family.
AC1_2_Scenario_00313	I can't leave right now.
AC1_2_Scenario_00011	The door's locked.
AC1_2_Scenario_00012	The door's locked.
AC1_2_Scenario_00013	Doesn't look like this key will\ndo the trick.
AC1_2_Scenario_00014	This won't open it.
AC1_2_Scenario_00018	No good. It's locked.
AC1_2_Scenario_00019	The door is locked tight.
AC1_2_Scenario_00022	No good. It won't open.
AC1_2_Scenario_00023	No good. It won't open.
AC1_2_Scenario_00026	No good. It won't open.
AC1_2_Scenario_00028	No good. It won't open.
AC1_2_Scenario_00029	No good. It's locked.
AC1_2_Scenario_00030	It's locked and won't open.
AC1_2_Scenario_00031	You used the E key.
AC1_2_Scenario_00032	It opened!
AC1_2_Scenario_00033	This key won't open it.
AC1_2_Scenario_00034	This won't open it.
AC1_2_Scenario_00035	This vase looks super expensive.\nEven thinking about touching it\nmakes me nervous.
AC1_2_Scenario_00036	It's not as dusty as I would\nhave thought.
AC1_2_Scenario_00042	Actually, it's super clean... Did\nsomeone just polish it?
AC1_2_Scenario_00043	There's a large vase with an elaborate design.
AC1_2_Scenario_00044	This vase looks super expensive.\nEven thinking about touching it\nmakes me nervous.
AC1_2_Scenario_00045	It's not as dusty as I would\nhave thought.
AC1_2_Scenario_00051	Actually, it's super clean... Did\nsomeone just polish it?
AC1_2_Scenario_00052	There's a large vase with an elaborate design.
AC1_2_Scenario_00314	Jessica...
AC1_2_Scenario_00315	Where could Jessica be?
AC1_2_Scenario_00316	Maybe...
AC1_2_Scenario_00317	Is Jessica through that door?
AC1_2_Scenario_00318	What should I do now? All the\ndoors are shut tight.
AC1_2_Scenario_00319	I'll never find my aunt at this\nrate.
AC1_2_Scenario_00320	I wonder if I can find some keys\nsomewhere...
AC1_2_Scenario_00053	There's an old grand piano.
AC1_2_Scenario_00054	How beautiful! This is such a\nlovely song.
AC1_2_Scenario_00055	It really is.
AC1_2_Scenario_00056	Every song Fannie played for me\nwas great.
AC1_2_Scenario_00057	But I especially loved this one.
AC1_2_Scenario_00058	You were really good too,\nAshley.
AC1_2_Scenario_00059	Thanks, D.
AC1_2_Scenario_00321	The air around the table smells like cigarettes.
AC1_2_Scenario_00322	Someone must have been here.\nCould it have been Dad?
AC1_2_Scenario_00323	The air around the table smells like cigarettes.
AC1_2_Scenario_00060	There's a lighter.
AC1_2_Scenario_00061	Hm...
AC1_2_Scenario_00062	What's wrong?
AC1_2_Scenario_00064	Someone was here. Did they\nleave this lighter on accident?
AC1_2_Scenario_00066	Are you taking it with you?
AC1_2_Scenario_00067	Yeah. It might be my dad's.
AC1_2_Scenario_00068	But, I really don't like the smell\nof cigarettes...
AC1_2_Scenario_00325	Did Dad forget this here?
AC1_2_Scenario_00327	I wonder if Dad smokes.
AC1_2_Scenario_00328	But, I really don't like the smell\nof cigarettes...
AC1_2_Scenario_00329	All done searching this room.\nI should check out another.
AC1_2_Scenario_00409	Huh? What's this mean?
AC1_2_Scenario_00331	Will something happen if I point\nthe camera at the crane?
AC1_2_Scenario_00332	Will something happen if I point\nthe camera at the crane?
AC1_2_Scenario_00069	What's this paper?
AC1_2_Scenario_00070	"Research into ANOTHER."
AC1_2_Scenario_00071	Authors Richard Robins...and\nSayoko Robins?
AC1_2_Scenario_00072	This is the research paper my\nparents wrote.
AC1_2_Scenario_00073	It's just the cover page though.
AC1_2_Scenario_00074	Someone must have taken the\nrest of the pages, but why?
AC1_2_Scenario_00076	A bag has been dropped on the floor.
AC1_2_Scenario_00099	No good. It won't open.
AC1_2_Scenario_00100	No good. It won't open.
AC1_2_Scenario_00333	What's D doing?
AC1_2_Scenario_00334	There's a lock on the door.
AC1_2_Scenario_00335	Does this lead to the room with\nthe piano in it?
AC1_2_Scenario_00336	Oh, I can unlock it.
AC1_2_Scenario_00337	The door unlocked.
AC1_2_Scenario_00105	No good. It's locked.
AC1_2_Scenario_00106	The door is locked tight.
AC1_2_Scenario_00116	It's a sturdy safe. The door is open.
AC1_2_Scenario_00117	It's a journal written by Wells.
AC1_2_Scenario_00118	Read Wells's journal again?
AC1_2_Scenario_00128	It continues on a page in the\nback.
AC1_2_Scenario_00130	Four silver dishes decorate the display shelf.
AC1_2_Scenario_00131	Such pretty dishes. The butler\nhad good taste.
AC1_2_Scenario_00132	I wish I could have seen you\ntalking with Wells.
AC1_2_Scenario_00133	I bet he would have called you\n"Young Missus" or something.
AC1_2_Scenario_00134	He really would have?
AC1_2_Scenario_00135	Oh, for sure. But...
AC1_2_Scenario_00136	But what?
AC1_2_Scenario_00137	Wells was really strict when it\ncame to manners. You would not\nhave wanted to make him mad.
AC1_2_Scenario_00138	Oh, I'm sure it wouldn't have been\ntoo long before he was mad at\nme for something.
AC1_2_Scenario_00139	Haha!
AC1_2_Scenario_00406	Four silver dishes decorate the display shelf.
AC1_2_Scenario_00140	There's an old album full of photos.
AC1_2_Scenario_00163	There's an old album full of photos.
AC1_2_Scenario_00164	Read the old album again?
AC1_2_Scenario_00167	July 1924\nThe two play in the yard
AC1_2_Scenario_00168	Masters Henry and Thomas are\ngrowing up in good health.
AC1_2_Scenario_00169	They're practically inseparable.\nThey make quite the pair.
AC1_2_Scenario_00170	Master Henry is a kind-hearted big brother,\nalways looking after young Master Thomas.
AC1_2_Scenario_00171	August 1932\nThe two play in a sports tournament
AC1_2_Scenario_00172	Master Henry, so wise and strong.\nMaster Thomas, sweet and honest.
AC1_2_Scenario_00173	The sound of laughter is ever present around\nthese bright and exuberant boys.
AC1_2_Scenario_00174	I'm sure Mr. Edward is indescribably\nproud of their growth. 
AC1_2_Scenario_00175	September 1934\nPortraits of the two
AC1_2_Scenario_00176	While Master Henry pursues art, Master\nThomas aims to be a writer.
AC1_2_Scenario_00177	The pair have grown into fine young\nmen, and Mr. Edward is truly...
AC1_2_Scenario_00178	hoping from the bottom of his heart that\nthey achieve the lives they so desire.
AC1_2_Scenario_00181	There's a teapot and teacup on the table.
AC1_2_Scenario_00182	Wow, they're so pretty. They\nmust be antiques.
AC1_2_Scenario_00183	I always loved the idea of having\ntea time with stuff like this.
AC1_2_Scenario_00184	Tiny cups, cute little cakes, the\nwhole setup.
AC1_2_Scenario_00185	I just remembered, Ashley. I\ndrank tea from this cup before.
AC1_2_Scenario_00186	When I first came to the\nmansion, Wells made milk tea...
AC1_2_Scenario_00187	Oh, yeah... And he served it with\nsome chocolate cake.
AC1_2_Scenario_00188	Ohh, I love chocolate cake! I'm\ngetting jealous. And hungry.
AC1_2_Scenario_00189	Haha. Oh, really?
AC1_2_Scenario_00190	There's a tea set on the table.
AC1_2_Scenario_00338	There's a tea pot and teacup on the table.
AC1_2_Scenario_00339	Huh...
AC1_2_Scenario_00340	What's wrong, D?
AC1_2_Scenario_00341	I feel like I've seen this\ncup before...
AC1_2_Scenario_00342	A portrait of the butler and another person\nhangs on the wall.
AC1_2_Scenario_00343	I wonder what's inside.
AC1_2_Scenario_00344	It's empty.
AC1_2_Scenario_00345	What's that on the bottom shelf?
AC1_2_Scenario_00346	It's a portrait of an elderly butler.
AC1_2_Scenario_00347	This is Wells, right?
AC1_2_Scenario_00348	There's a woman next to the butler.
AC1_2_Scenario_00349	This must be Wells's wife.
AC1_2_Scenario_00350	There's a display shelf decorated with silver\ntableware in the background.
AC1_2_Scenario_00351	There's a display shelf decorated with silver\ntableware in the background.
AC1_2_Scenario_00352	Could this have been painted\nhere?
AC1_2_Scenario_00353	There's a display shelf decorated with silver\ntableware in the background.
AC1_2_Scenario_00354	The tableware in the portrait\nlooks the same as the tableware\nin this room.
AC1_2_Scenario_00355	There's a display shelf decorated with silver\ntableware in the background.
AC1_2_Scenario_00356	The tableware in the portrait\nlooks the same as the tableware\nin this room.
AC1_2_Scenario_00357	If that's the case, maybe it's\nshowing me to how to line it up.
AC1_2_Scenario_00362	What's this?
AC1_2_Scenario_00363	Is this a map of the mansion?
AC1_2_Scenario_00364	Huh?
AC1_2_Scenario_00365	There's something written on the\nspace for this room.
AC1_2_Scenario_00407	I should make notes of the\ninteresting things I find.
AC1_2_Scenario_00366	The drawer is empty.
AC1_2_Scenario_00367	There's a dusty desk lamp.
AC1_2_Scenario_00368	There are several books on the desk.
AC1_2_Scenario_00191	You can see the ocean from the window.
AC1_2_Scenario_00369	D, what's— Huh?
AC1_2_Scenario_00370	What's he up to? He can't take\nhis eyes off that portrait.
AC1_2_Scenario_00371	Hey, D? You're, uh... Gonna burn\na hole in that thing if you stare\nat it any longer.
AC1_2_Scenario_00193	There's a drawing on the table.
AC1_2_Scenario_00408	The drawing is of a young girl with a\ngentle smile.
AC1_2_Scenario_00372	D, what's— Huh?
AC1_2_Scenario_00373	What's he up to? He can't take\nhis eyes off that portrait.
AC1_2_Scenario_00374	Hey, D? You're, uh... Gonna burn\na hole in that thing if you stare\nat it any longer.
AC1_2_Scenario_00375	D, what's— Huh?
AC1_2_Scenario_00376	What's he up to? He can't take\nhis eyes off that portrait.
AC1_2_Scenario_00377	You're awfully focused on that\nportrait, D...
AC1_2_Scenario_00200	There's a notepad on the dresser.
AC1_2_Scenario_00201	This notepad looks new.\nI wonder if it's my dad's.
AC1_2_Scenario_00202	What's written on it?
AC1_2_Scenario_00203	8/15 Bill is coming.
AC1_2_Scenario_00204	Who's Bill?
AC1_2_Scenario_00205	No clue.
AC1_2_Scenario_00206	Maybe a friend of my dad's?
AC1_2_Scenario_00207	There's something else written\nhere too.
AC1_2_Scenario_00208	Looks like some notes have been\njotted down here...
AC1_2_Scenario_00209	Shopping list (for Bill):\nChocolate\nPotato chips
AC1_2_Scenario_00210	Mandheling (for café au lait)\nApple soda
AC1_2_Scenario_00211	My dad likes chocolate too.
AC1_2_Scenario_00212	There's a notepad on the dresser.
AC1_2_Scenario_00213	8/15 Bill is coming.
AC1_2_Scenario_00214	Shopping list (for Bill):\nChocolate\nPotato chips
AC1_2_Scenario_00215	Mandheling (for café au lait)\nApple soda
AC1_2_Scenario_00216	A canvas sits on the easel. It's a painting of a\nmoonlit cove.
AC1_2_Scenario_00217	A canvas sits on the easel. It's a painting of a\nmoonlit cove.
AC1_2_Scenario_00218	There's an old sketch of a young girl on\nthe easel.
AC1_2_Scenario_00219	There's an old sketch of a young girl on\nthe easel.
AC1_2_Scenario_00378	Did something spark a memory?
AC1_2_Scenario_00379	A bird with a flower in its beak adorns the\nlocked door.
AC1_2_Scenario_00231	This is the wrong key.
AC1_2_Scenario_00232	It won't open this door.
AC1_2_Scenario_00380	Hmm...
AC1_2_Scenario_00381	Is something wrong?
AC1_2_Scenario_00382	A bird with a golden sprout in its beak adorns\nthe door.
AC1_2_Scenario_00233	Do you know what room this is?
AC1_2_Scenario_00234	No, I can't remember.
AC1_2_Scenario_00235	It's locked. It won't open up.
AC1_2_Scenario_00383	A bird with a golden sprout in its beak adorns\nthe locked door.
AC1_2_Scenario_00237	It opened!
AC1_2_Scenario_00238	This is the wrong key.
AC1_2_Scenario_00239	Can't open it with this.
AC1_2_Scenario_00384	A bird with a three-leaf clover in its beak\nadorns the locked door.
AC1_2_Scenario_00385	No good, it's locked up. Do you\nknow what room this is?
AC1_2_Scenario_00386	Sorry, I can't remember.
AC1_2_Scenario_00387	There's a picture of a bird with a\nthree-leaf clover in its beak on\nthe door.
AC1_2_Scenario_00388	You used the three-leaf clover key.
AC1_2_Scenario_00389	Yes, it opened!
AC1_2_Scenario_00390	Doesn't look like this key will\ndo the trick.
AC1_2_Scenario_00391	This won't open it.
AC1_2_Scenario_00392	The courtyard is past here.
AC1_2_Scenario_00393	No luck... It won't open.
AC1_2_Scenario_00394	The door to the courtyard is locked up tight.
AC1_2_Scenario_00253	It's a cute teddy bear.
AC1_2_Scenario_00264	There's a child's bed. It looks pretty old.
AC1_2_Scenario_00397	There's a child's bed. It looks pretty old.
AC1_2_Scenario_00398	The blanket's color has faded.
AC1_2_Scenario_00399	A little girl used to sleep here, a\nlong time ago...
AC1_2_Scenario_00401	I wonder if there's something\nbehind it.
AC1_2_Scenario_00402	There's nothing behind the book.
AC1_2_Scenario_00265	There's a shelf decorated with a doll.
AC1_2_Scenario_00266	There's a shelf decorated with dolls.
AC1_2_Scenario_00267	The dolls are all lined up and holding hands.
AC1_2_Scenario_00268	There's an open letter beside the book\non the table.
AC1_2_Scenario_00269	This letter's all crumpled up. It\nmust have made someone angry.
AC1_2_Scenario_00270	I wouldn't want to be that letter.
AC1_2_Scenario_00271	Let's see what it says.
AC1_2_Scenario_00273	It's a letter from the people who\nwere working in the mine.
AC1_2_Scenario_00274	Who's this new president?
AC1_2_Scenario_00275	I have no idea.
AC1_2_Scenario_00282	There's a dresser with a three-sided mirror.
AC1_2_Scenario_00405	Hey, there's something else in\nthe drawer.
AC1_2_Scenario_00403	Shells collected by D and Frannie fill the box.
AC1_2_Scenario_00312	There's a document in the bag.
AC1_2_00003	Hello?
AC1_2_00005	Is anyone in here?
AC1_2_00007	*sigh*
AC1_2_00010	Jessica! Can you hear me?
AC1_2_00011	Come on, Jessica!
AC1_2_00013	I guess no one's here...
AC1_2_00014	But Jessica's gotta be around\nhere somewhere.
AC1_2_00015	She's probably with Dad.
AC1_2_00017	Wait— D?
AC1_2_00027	D! This door is open!
AC1_2_00031	D? Are you coming?
AC1_2_00036	What a huge painting.
AC1_2_00038	Do you remember something\nabout him?
AC1_2_00042	Hm...
AC1_2_00044	Welcome.
AC1_2_00630	Hm...
AC1_2_00047	Huh. Who is this?
AC1_2_00049	There's a name.
AC1_2_00050	Lawrence Edward. Patriarch.
AC1_2_00051	So this is the guy that owned\nthis place?
AC1_2_00053	Ashley, this man...
AC1_2_00054	He's my great-grandfather.
AC1_2_00055	So you're part of the family that\nowned this house? The Edwards?
AC1_2_00056	Did you use to live here?
AC1_2_00057	No...
AC1_2_00058	I came here with my father...
AC1_2_00059	To visit my great-grandfather.\nHe was very ill.
AC1_2_00060	And then...
AC1_2_00062	That song...
AC1_2_00063	Huh?
AC1_2_00064	That's right. When we arrived...
AC1_2_00065	I heard someone playing the\nloveliest song on the piano.
AC1_2_00632	A piano?
AC1_2_00633	Let's look around and see if we\ncan find one.
AC1_2_00634	I'll come with you.
AC1_2_00635	Oh, um... OK.
AC1_2_00638	It's a piano.
AC1_2_00097	Is this the piano you were\ntalking about?
AC1_2_00098	I think...
AC1_2_00099	D?
AC1_2_00639	*gasp*
AC1_2_00104	Hello.
AC1_2_00106	You must be the guest\nPapa told me about.
AC1_2_00109	Frannie.
AC1_2_00110	What?
AC1_2_00111	I remember, Ashley.
AC1_2_00112	The person playing the piano?\nIt was <color=#00994CFF>Frannie</color>.
AC1_2_00116	Who's Frannie?
AC1_2_00117	A girl who used to live here.
AC1_2_00118	She used to live here? Were you\nrelated?
AC1_2_00120	I'm...not sure.
AC1_2_00121	It was Frannie who used to\ncall me D.
AC1_2_00122	This house is where we first\nbecame friends.
AC1_2_00124	Yeah? That's great! I'm glad you\nremembered something.
AC1_2_00125	Forgetting all your friends\nsounds so sad.
AC1_2_00640	Yeah. You're right.
AC1_2_00642	Hm.
AC1_2_00643	Something wrong?
AC1_2_00644	Jessica isn't here either...
AC1_2_00645	Where could she be?
AC1_2_00150	Huh?
AC1_2_00151	Ashley! Did you hear that?
AC1_2_00152	Sounds like it triggered\nsomething. Let's look around.
AC1_2_00648	There's a key!
AC1_2_00649	Let's look for a place to use it.
AC1_2_00653	Oh, there's a key here.
AC1_2_00654	Wonder where I can use it.
AC1_2_00658	What's this?
AC1_2_00660	It's an origami crane.
AC1_2_00661	Ori...gami?
AC1_2_00662	Yeah, it's made of paper.
AC1_2_00663	My mom would make these for me\nall the time when I was a baby.
AC1_2_00664	I don't really remember myself,\nbut Jessica told me about it.
AC1_2_00665	Huh.
AC1_2_00666	But I wonder who made this one...
AC1_2_00668	Is the DAS reacting?
AC1_2_00671	Oh, it's a hallway. Looks like it\nleads to more rooms.
AC1_2_00673	If only there was some way of\nknowing where Jessica is...
AC1_2_00674	But I guess we'll just have to\nsearch the rooms one by one.
AC1_2_00158	What do you think this room\nwas for?
AC1_2_00183	Ha, got it! The safe is unlocked!
AC1_2_00184	Well done, Ashley!
AC1_2_00185	OK, let's see what we have\nhere.
AC1_2_00187	This is...
AC1_2_00676	Yes, a key! Two keys, as a matter\nof fact.
AC1_2_00677	Now we can get into those\nlocked rooms.
AC1_2_00192	What's this notebook?
AC1_2_00194	Wells must have written it.
AC1_2_00210	This Mr. Edward must have\nbeen your great-grandfather, D.
AC1_2_00211	You're probably right.
AC1_2_00212	Henry and Thomas...
AC1_2_00213	If they were brothers and they\nwere Lawrence's grandchildren...
AC1_2_00679	Hm...
AC1_2_00680	D? You all right?
AC1_2_00681	*gasp*
AC1_2_00683	Henry, enough already.
AC1_2_00684	What are you trying\nto say, Thomas?
AC1_2_00686	I just remembered something...
AC1_2_00687	Back then, Uncle Henry called\nmy father...
AC1_2_00688	Thomas.
AC1_2_00689	Thomas?
AC1_2_00690	Your father's name is Thomas!
AC1_2_00691	D, that's great! You remembered\nyour dad!
AC1_2_00692	...
AC1_2_00694	Frannie's father is Henry...\nD's father is Thomas.
AC1_2_00695	And Henry and Thomas were\nbrothers. They died on this\nisland in the same year.
AC1_2_00696	I wonder what happened...
AC1_2_00697	D looks so upset. He's probably\nwondering the same thing.
AC1_2_00700	Wells always said that this silver\ntableware represents the family.
AC1_2_00701	Like each person got their own\nspecial piece?
AC1_2_00702	Yeah, a new piece was added\neach time the family grew.
AC1_2_00703	I think the biggest goblet is for\nmy great-grandfather...
AC1_2_00704	And these small plates are me\nand Frannie.
AC1_2_00705	I see... Then who's this big plate\nsupposed to be?
AC1_2_00706	Now, that... I can't remember.
AC1_2_00707	*sigh*
AC1_2_00708	But at least the family is all back\ntogether now.
AC1_2_00709	Oh yeah. I guess you're right.
AC1_2_00241	What? This was some sort of\npuzzle all along?
AC1_2_00242	Look, there's something in there.
AC1_2_00712	There's a portrait on the wall.
AC1_2_00713	Who's this?
AC1_2_00715	Ah!
AC1_2_00717	You mustn't enter my\nquarters at your whim.
AC1_2_00719	Huh...
AC1_2_00720	Something the matter?
AC1_2_00721	I just remembered something.
AC1_2_00722	This was Wells's room.
AC1_2_00723	Wells?
AC1_2_00724	He was the butler of this\nmansion.
AC1_2_00725	He found me in here once and\nsaid to me...
AC1_2_00726	"Butlers safeguard all manner of\nimportant items for the people\nof their houses.
AC1_2_00727	"So you mustn't enter my\nquarters at your whim."
AC1_2_00728	I wonder what sort of important\nitems he was looking after.
AC1_2_00729	Umm... Oh.
AC1_2_00730	It was keys. Wells held every key\nfor the mansion.
AC1_2_00732	They might be helpful for\nfinding Jessica.
AC1_2_00733	Let's look around for them.
AC1_2_00281	So many paintings.
AC1_2_00282	But...
AC1_2_00284	No Jessica.
AC1_2_00734	*gasp*
AC1_2_00735	D? Something up?
AC1_2_00736	Did you remember something?
AC1_2_00299	D, look!
AC1_2_00300	What is it?
AC1_2_00301	You can see the ocean. It's so\npretty, isn't it?
AC1_2_00302	Yeah.
AC1_2_00303	Jessica and I came here on\na boat.
AC1_2_00304	Maybe you and your dad...
AC1_2_00305	Came by boat as well... Could be.
AC1_2_00306	You'd have to, right?
AC1_2_00308	When I first saw the island from\nthe boat, I felt something...
AC1_2_00309	What did you feel?
AC1_2_00310	I didn't get it at the time, but I\nthink I do now. At least a little.
AC1_2_00311	What is it?
AC1_2_00312	It's about meeting my dad.
AC1_2_00313	I just kept thinking...what do I do\nif he's a jerk?
AC1_2_00314	Are you scared of that?
AC1_2_00315	Maybe. A little.
AC1_2_00317	There's a drawing on the table.
AC1_2_00318	Huh. This paper looks new.
AC1_2_00319	I wonder who the girl is.
AC1_2_00320	Maybe it's Frannie?
AC1_2_00321	No, I don't think so.
AC1_2_00322	This girl...
AC1_2_00323	She looks a little like you.
AC1_2_00324	Huh?
AC1_2_00325	Wait, it couldn't be...
AC1_2_00326	Did my dad draw this picture\nof me?
AC1_2_00328	I, um...
AC1_2_00329	What's wrong? Aren't you happy?
AC1_2_00330	Does he think I look like this? It's,\nwell, it's not very accurate.
AC1_2_00333	Oh no.
AC1_2_00334	What is it?
AC1_2_00335	What if Dad doesn't even\nrecognize me?
AC1_2_00739	Hm, there's something...
AC1_2_00338	A picture was left under the silver plate.
AC1_2_00339	This is...
AC1_2_00340	A picture of a woman holding\na baby. Who is this?
AC1_2_00740	That's... She's...
AC1_2_00347	Hurry, Ashley! Hide!
AC1_2_00348	Right...
AC1_2_00349	I remember who said that.
AC1_2_00351	It was Mom.
AC1_2_00352	The woman in the photo is\nyour mother?
AC1_2_00353	That must mean the baby is...
AC1_2_00354	Yeah. It's... It's me.
AC1_2_00894	This must be Dad's photo.
AC1_2_00746	What a lovely painting. This may\nbe my favorite room so far.
AC1_2_00747	But it feels somehow...lonely.\nI can't put my finger on why.
AC1_2_00748	*gasp*
AC1_2_00749	Hm...
AC1_2_00750	What did you remember?
AC1_2_00751	I've seen this picture...
AC1_2_00752	But before it was finished. It\nused to be of the ocean in\nthe afternoon light.
AC1_2_00753	But now it's the ocean at\nnighttime... I wonder why\nit was changed.
AC1_2_00757	What is it?
AC1_2_00364	*gasp*
AC1_2_00759	Wanna see a picture\nthat Papa drew?
AC1_2_00760	I'll show you, but it'll be our\nsecret. OK, D?
AC1_2_00365	It's Frannie!
AC1_2_00366	Huh?
AC1_2_00367	Ashley, it's Frannie!
AC1_2_00762	Uncle Henry drew this!
AC1_2_00763	Uncle Henry?
AC1_2_00764	Yeah, Frannie's papa.
AC1_2_00765	So Frannie's dad is Henry, and\nthe kid in this picture is Frannie.
AC1_2_00371	But it's a little rough, so it's hard\nto be sure...
AC1_2_00372	Frannie grabbed my hand and\npulled me into this room.
AC1_2_00373	She showed this to me and said\nthat her dad was a great artist.
AC1_2_00374	She said she asked him to draw a\npicture of me too. 
AC1_2_00375	After that, we went into the\nyard. There was a puppy...
AC1_2_00376	Huh.
AC1_2_00378	Seeing D so happy, talking about\nhis memories with Frannie...
AC1_2_00379	It's a little...well, weird.
AC1_2_00380	D was with Frannie, the girl in\nthis old drawing.
AC1_2_00381	And that same boy is here with\nme... Right now.
AC1_2_00897	Frannie...
AC1_2_00898	Huh?
AC1_2_00899	This was Frannie's room.
AC1_2_00900	Oh, wow. Really?
AC1_2_00901	Ashley, open this door.
AC1_2_00902	I feel like I'm about to\nremember something!
AC1_2_00903	Got it. But I wonder if it's...
AC1_2_00905	Yep. Locked.
AC1_2_00386	Yes! It opened!
AC1_2_00387	Now we can look in\nFrannie's room!
AC1_2_00388	Maybe you'll remember something\nelse, D.
AC1_2_00389	Yes!
AC1_2_00396	Huh? D?
AC1_2_00397	This is it, Ashley!
AC1_2_00398	This is Frannie's room!
AC1_2_00766	This is where we'd play together.
AC1_2_00421	Oh man, what a cute teddy bear!
AC1_2_00422	That was Frannie's favorite.
AC1_2_00423	These vintage bears are cool.\nI actually love teddy bears...
AC1_2_00424	*gasp*
AC1_2_00426	Suddenly, I remember that night.\nThe one from my dreams.
AC1_2_00427	That night... On the table...
AC1_2_00428	There was a cake with candles...\nAnd a bear with a red ribbon.
AC1_2_00430	Here you go, Ashley. This is a\npresent from Daddy.
AC1_2_00431	Yeah... That's what Mom said.
AC1_2_00432	But Dad wasn't there. Where was\nhe that night?
AC1_2_00435	Ashley?
AC1_2_00436	I...
AC1_2_00437	What's wrong?
AC1_2_00438	D, I remembered something too.\nWhen I saw the bear, my mom...
AC1_2_00439	Your mother?
AC1_2_00440	Yeah.
AC1_2_00441	I barely remember anything\nabout her.
AC1_2_00442	But sometimes I have this dream.
AC1_2_00443	I feel like it ends in the middle\nthough. Like there's more to it.
AC1_2_00444	Huh. That reminds me of\nsomething Jessica said.
AC1_2_00445	She told me that if I meet my dad,\nI'll also learn about my mom.
AC1_2_00446	Is that why you came here to\nsee him?
AC1_2_00447	I... Maybe.
AC1_2_00768	There's a child's bed. It looks pretty old.
AC1_2_00769	The blanket's color has faded.
AC1_2_00770	A little girl used to sleep here, a\nlong time ago...
AC1_2_00771	Hey, D... What was Frannie like?
AC1_2_00772	Umm, well...
AC1_2_00773	I guess she was mostly sweet, but\nshe could be a little sassy.
AC1_2_00774	She was real easy to make laugh,\nbut real easy to make cry too.
AC1_2_00775	And...
AC1_2_00776	She was incredibly lonely.
AC1_2_00777	Oh...
AC1_2_00780	A doll sits in a box meant for building blocks.
AC1_2_00781	What's with this doll?
AC1_2_00782	Its right arm is missing.
AC1_2_00783	Really?
AC1_2_00784	Yeah, I guess it broke off.
AC1_2_00786	Ah!
AC1_2_00787	D, look at this doll.
AC1_2_00790	I just remembered something.
AC1_2_00791	What is it?
AC1_2_00792	Frannie made this doll.
AC1_2_00793	Wow, she made this herself?\nPretty impressive.
AC1_2_00794	The missing piece must be\naround here somewhere.
AC1_2_00795	I don't think this doll is broken. I\nthink it's supposed to be missing\nits right arm.
AC1_2_00796	This is a doll of Frannie's father.
AC1_2_00797	And?
AC1_2_00798	And Frannie's father...
AC1_2_00799	...was missing his right arm.
AC1_2_00801	Really?
AC1_2_00908	There's a doll inside the box meant for\nbuilding blocks.
AC1_2_00909	I wonder if Frannie made this\ndoll too.
AC1_2_00910	It's missing its right arm.
AC1_2_00911	What?
AC1_2_00912	It's broken. See?
AC1_2_00913	Oh, you're right.
AC1_2_00914	The missing piece must be\nsomewhere around here.
AC1_2_00915	I don't think this doll is broken. I\nthink it's supposed to be missing\nits right arm.
AC1_2_00916	This is a doll of Frannie's father.
AC1_2_00917	And?
AC1_2_00918	And Frannie's father...
AC1_2_00919	was missing his right arm.
AC1_2_00920	Hmm.
AC1_2_00453	What's with this doll?
AC1_2_00454	*gasp*
AC1_2_00805	Ah!
AC1_2_00806	D, look at this doll.
AC1_2_00456	I just remembered something.
AC1_2_00457	What is it?
AC1_2_00458	Frannie made this doll.
AC1_2_00459	Wow, she made this herself?\nPretty impressive.
AC1_2_00460	There was this one and, let me\nthink...two others.
AC1_2_00461	Dolls that looked like her mama\nand papa.
AC1_2_00462	This one...
AC1_2_00463	She made this doll to look\nlike herself.
AC1_2_00466	So this one is supposed to\nbe Frannie.
AC1_2_00467	Yes.
AC1_2_00469	What's wrong? Is something\nbothering you?
AC1_2_00470	I remember something\nFrannie said...
AC1_2_00472	D, these dolls have to be nice to\neach other.
AC1_2_00473	If they get along, then...
AC1_2_00474	Then? Then what?
AC1_2_00475	Sorry. That's all I remember.
AC1_2_00476	The dolls need to get along?\nWhat does that mean?
AC1_2_00482	Hey, D. Take a look at this doll.
AC1_2_00483	It's Frannie's.
AC1_2_00484	She made it to look like herself.
AC1_2_00487	So this one is supposed to\nbe Frannie.
AC1_2_00488	Yes.
AC1_2_00490	What's wrong? Is something\nbothering you?
AC1_2_00491	I remember something\nFrannie said...
AC1_2_00493	D, these dolls have to be\nnice to each other.
AC1_2_00494	If they get along, then...
AC1_2_00495	Then? Then what?
AC1_2_00496	Sorry. That's all I remember.
AC1_2_00497	The dolls need to get along?\nWhat does that mean?
AC1_2_00808	And in here, we have...
AC1_2_00809	A key!
AC1_2_00810	I wonder which room this key\nis for.
AC1_2_00813	What's this?
AC1_2_00814	It's a ribbon Frannie loved.
AC1_2_00501	Frannie looks so happy holding\nhands with her mom and dad.
AC1_2_00502	Yes.
AC1_2_00503	Frannie told me that she loved\nher mama and papa very much.
AC1_2_00504	Then why were the dolls in\nseparate places?
AC1_2_00505	I wonder what was going on...
AC1_2_00510	I...
AC1_2_00511	Does this spark any memories?
AC1_2_00512	This is...
AC1_2_00513	Yes, Ashley. I remember\nsomething!
AC1_2_00514	This room belonged to\nFrannie's parents.
AC1_2_00819	There's a doll.
AC1_2_00821	Ah!
AC1_2_00823	D, look at this doll.
AC1_2_00825	This doll's made of wood.
AC1_2_00826	I think it's a woman. I wonder who\nit's supposed to be.
AC1_2_00827	I just remembered something.
AC1_2_00828	What's that?
AC1_2_00829	Frannie made this doll.
AC1_2_00830	Wow, she made this\nherself? Impressive.
AC1_2_00831	This doll must be Frannie's\nmother.
AC1_2_00834	Is this a letter?
AC1_2_00520	Dear Henry,\n\n   This is farewell.\n   Having lost not only your beloved\ngrandfather, but others so dear to you\nin such a short time, I'm sure you are\nconsumed by a grief deeper than I can\nunderstand.\n   I believed that Frannie and I could heal\nyour heart. But you have changed since \nsealing yourself off in the Silver Bird\nRoom.\n   I saw how you threw the sprout key\ninto the fountain.\n   You spend every day confined in your\nroom, lost in a bottle of alcohol and\nterrified of an unseen force. You seem\nto have lost your will to live. Even\nFrannie is frightened by how long it's\nbeen since you picked up a pencil or\npaintbrush.\n   And yet, you still refused to leave the\nroom. I can no longer see your heart,\nHenry. I'm taking Frannie and I'm leaving\nthe island.\n   I will never forget how deeply I loved\nyou.\n\nMarie
AC1_2_00522	Who's Marie?
AC1_2_00523	Frannie's mama.
AC1_2_00524	Oh.
AC1_2_00525	Why do you look so sad?
AC1_2_00526	Well, this is a goodbye letter.
AC1_2_00527	I don't know what happened\nbetween her mom and dad, but...
AC1_2_00528	I'm sure Frannie wanted them all\nto stay together.
AC1_2_00530	That's why I'm sad.
AC1_2_00531	Ashley...
AC1_2_00538	Not here either... Where could\nyou be, Jessica?
AC1_2_00841	It's a hummingbird.
AC1_2_00842	It's crooked. This bothers me to\nno end...
AC1_2_00844	This is sheet music, isn't it?
AC1_2_00845	Why was it hidden behind a\npainting?
AC1_2_00846	Hmm, the painting is of this bird...
AC1_2_00848	Ah!
AC1_2_00850	Did you know there's a puzzle \nhidden in this sheet music?
AC1_2_00851	If you solve the puzzle and play\nthe music, you'll get to see the\npiano's secret!
AC1_2_00853	I just remembered something.
AC1_2_00854	This is the sheet music Frannie\nplayed on the piano.
AC1_2_00855	Oh, really? I wonder if I'd be able\nto play it.
AC1_2_00856	You can play?
AC1_2_00857	Yeah, I practice on a school\npiano once in a while.
AC1_2_00858	Will you try playing this song?
AC1_2_00860	I'll give it a shot. Maybe it'll help\njog some more memories.
AC1_2_00861	Frannie told me there's a puzzle\nhidden in this sheet music.
AC1_2_00862	Hmm... I wonder what it could be.
AC1_2_00866	A box fell out of the piano!
AC1_2_00867	I wonder what it is...
AC1_2_00870	This is...
AC1_2_00872	Frannie found these on the\nbeach.
AC1_2_00874	It's shells. They're kind of pretty.
AC1_2_00875	Oh, right. I remember these.
AC1_2_00876	Frannie found them. These are\nour treasure.
AC1_2_00877	She hid them here.
AC1_2_00879	Hm?
AC1_2_00880	What's this card? It looks like a\ngame cartridge.
AC1_2_00881	Is this Frannie's too?
AC1_2_00882	No, I've never seen that.
AC1_2_00884	What's that noise?
AC1_2_00885	It's the DAS. What's it doing?
AC1_2_00886	Did it read the card?
AC1_2_00888	I've never seen this screen... Is\nthis a map of the mansion?
AC1_2_00889	One of the rooms is glowing.
AC1_2_00890	What's this ANOTHER key?
AC1_2_00891	I have no idea.
AC1_2_00892	ANOTHER key...
AC1_2_00618	What the—
AC1_2_00622	Who are you?
AC1_2_00626	I've been waiting for you.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00001	There's an ashtray filled with cigarette butts.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00002	So many cigarettes...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00003	Is my dad a chain smoker\nor something?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00004	There's an ashtray filled with cigarette butts.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00005	There's an ashtray filled with cigarette butts.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00007	Hmm...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00008	There's something about this\nashtray...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00009	What about it?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00010	Try brushing it off.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00011	Um, sure... OK.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00012	Brushing away the cigarette butts and ashes\nrevealed a beautiful bird in relief.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00013	Wow. What's this?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00014	I thought so. This ashtray is from\nthe butler's room.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00234	There's a sturdy-looking safe.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00235	A safe this sturdy...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00236	has gotta be protecting\nsomething important.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00238	Do you think you can get it open?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00239	Let's see...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00240	Nope. It's locked tight.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00243	Well, I hope there's a clue\nsomewhere around here...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00033	Can you open it?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00034	No, I don't have the combination.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00035	Maybe there's a clue somewhere\naround here.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00244	There's a sturdy-looking safe.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00245	I wonder what's inside.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00250	Nope. It's locked tight.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00251	Don't suppose you know the\ncombination, do you?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00252	Sure don't.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00253	Do you think Wells left it\nsomewhere?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00036	Can you open it?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00254	Silver tableware is displayed on a shelf.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00255	I wonder where the rest of the\nplates are.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00256	Hopefully not too far from these.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00257	Guess we gotta look for them.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00258	So, the four plates...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00259	If keeping them together is so\nimportant, let's line these up.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00260	I'm sure Wells would\nappreciate that.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00261	I put all the plates we have on\nthe shelf, but...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00262	I guess we don't have them all.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00263	We found two plates, so there\nmust be one left.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00264	I put all the plates we have on\nthe shelf, but...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00265	I guess we don't have them all.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00266	We found two plates, so there\nmust be one left.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00267	I put all the plates we have on\nthe shelf, but...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00268	I guess we don't have them all.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00269	We found two plates, so there\nmust be one left.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00270	Where could the last plate be?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00271	It's an important one, so maybe\nit's hidden around here.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00272	I put the plate we have on\nthe shelf, but...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00273	I guess we don't have them all.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00274	Where are the other two plates?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00275	I put the plate we have on\nthe shelf, but...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00276	I guess we don't have them all.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00277	Where are the other two plates?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00278	I put the plate we have on\nthe shelf, but...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00279	I guess we don't have them all.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00280	Where are the other two plates?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00281	We need two more plates, right?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00282	They're important, so maybe\nWells hid them around here.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00283	We need two more plates, right?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00284	They're important, so maybe\nWells hid them around here.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00285	We need two more plates, right?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00286	Maybe we missed one in a room\nwe already searched.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00287	A full set of silver tableware is displayed\non the shelves.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00288	I hope Wells is happy now that the\ntableware is all back together.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00289	I'm sure he is.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00290	Let's check out the portrait that\njust opened.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00291	A full set of silver tableware is displayed\non the shelves.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00292	Let's check out the portrait that\njust opened.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00293	Silver tableware is lined up on the\ndisplay shelves.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00294	I hope Wells is happy now that the\ntableware is all back together.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00038	No good, it won't open... The\ncombination must be wrong.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00039	There must be a clue somewhere\naround here.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00040	No good, it won't open... The\ncombination must be wrong.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00041	You think maybe Wells wrote the\ncode down somewhere?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00042	It's not opening. Whether I turn\nthe dial left or right must be\nimportant too.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00044	There was something written\non that map we just found,\nwasn't there?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00051	Silver tableware is displayed on wall-mounted\nshelves.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00052	This silver tableware is old,\nbut pretty.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00053	Wells really cherished these.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00054	He kept them so polished, you\ncould see your reflection.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00055	But now they're so tarnished.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00056	It's kind of sad.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00057	That's strange...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00058	What is?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00059	There were four plates the last\ntime I saw them.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00060	It's important to keep all the\nplates together...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00061	I remember Wells saying that.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00062	Four important plates, huh?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00296	The pedestal came down. It must\nbe some sort of mechanism...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00076	Silver tableware is displayed on wall-mounted\nshelves.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00077	I wonder where the other plates\ncould be.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00078	Do you think someone took them\nout of here?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00079	It's terrible to think someone\nwould just walk off with such\nimportant plates.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00088	Silver tableware is displayed on wall-mounted\ndisplay shelves.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00297	Could how they're lined up be just\nas important as getting them all\ntogether?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00101	We got all four, but nothing's\nhappening.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00102	Could how they're lined up be just\nas important as getting them all\ntogether?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00103	Hm... Do you remember how they\nwere lined up back then?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00104	Sorry, no.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00136	Where could that other plate be?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00137	Maybe we missed one in a room\nwe already searched.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00139	Where could that other plate be?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00140	I bet there's something in a room\nwe haven't been in yet.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00298	Guess nothing's gonna happen...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00299	Hmm, yeah... I feel like it's not\njust about getting them all, but\nthe order they're in too...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00300	Maybe we can find a hint for\nhow to line them up.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00301	Grr... Nothing's happening at all!
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00302	The order they're lined up in\nmust be important. I'm sure of it!
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00303	Well, it's not like we can ask Wells\nfor the right order.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00305	Let's just try lining up the ones\nwe have for now.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00304	Maybe Wells's portrait can tell\nus the answer.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00306	There's silver tableware on the shelf.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00171	The shelf with the plate is the\nonly one that isn't level...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00172	There's silver tableware on the shelf.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00181	There's a silver goblet with a crest on it.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00182	This is a pretty cool goblet.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00183	There's a silver goblet with a crest on it.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00184	There's silver stemware with flowers on it.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00185	This is really nice...but so dusty.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00186	There's silver stemware with flowers on it.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00187	There's silver stemware with flowers on it.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00188	It's a shame such a pretty thing\nwas left to get all dusty.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00189	There's silver stemware with flowers on it.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00307	Hmm...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00308	I feel like I'm so close to\nremembering something...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00309	Silver tableware is displayed on wall-mounted\ndisplay shelves.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00190	There's some silver tableware in the drawer.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00191	Wow, is this real silver? These\nmust be antiques or something.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00192	That plate...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00193	What is it, D?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00194	I can't be sure, but...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00195	I just feel like this plate is\nsomehow...precious.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00196	Precious?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00198	There's some silver tableware in the drawer.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00205	D, look at this plate!
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00206	All right! That's one of Wells's\nsilver plates!
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00208	I should put it back where it\nbelongs.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00215	There's some chocolate on a silver plate.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00310	It's partially eaten... But by who?
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00311	I feel like I've seen this before...
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00312	The chocolate's been sitting\nhere for that long?!
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00313	No, the plate! This silver plate\nwas... Someone treasured it.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00314	Ugh, no good. I can't remember.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00223	There's some chocolate on a silver plate.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00316	There's some chocolate on a silver plate.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00230	Hey, D. Check out this plate.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00231	Oh, yeah! That's a piece of the\ntableware set Wells loved.
AC1_Mystery_2_1_00233	I should put it back where it\nbelongs.
AC1_Mystery_2_2_00032	Let's use the key we got from the\nsafe to get into Frannie's room.
AC1_Mystery_2_2_00033	Right. Her room is on the second\nfloor, isn't it?
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00012	There's a doll in the drawer.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00013	D, check it out. This doll\nmust be...
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00014	Yeah, Frannie made it. This one\nmust be her mom.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00145	The last doll doesn't seem to\nbe here...
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00146	Maybe it's in another room.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00147	The box is full of building blocks.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00016	There are all sorts of shapes in\nhere. Were these Frannie's?
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00017	Is that something beneath all\nthe blocks?
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00023	A box meant for building blocks\nthat contained a doll.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00148	Hmm... Nothing but wooden\nbuilding blocks.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00149	That's strange... I thought I\njust saw something.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00150	Are your eyes playing tricks\non you?
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00151	No way! I definitely saw it.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00152	Take another look inside\nthe box!
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00030	There's something left in the\nbox.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00099	There's a display shelf for dolls.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00103	Check it out, D. There's a drawer.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00104	Let's see if I can open it.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00105	Give it a shot.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00106	It won't open.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00108	There's a drawer attached to the display shelf.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00109	A drawer that won't open.\nHmmm...
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00110	I wonder how you open it.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00115	There's a faded ribbon.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00116	There's a space that looks like it could hold\na doll.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00117	I'll put this doll...here.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00118	I think I'll put this doll here.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00119	Maybe I'll put this doll here...
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00120	Doesn't go here...
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00121	It's open!
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00122	This must be what she meant by\nthe dolls "getting along."
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00123	I wonder what's in here.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00124	Nothing happened.
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00125	I don't think the dolls are quite\ngetting along yet...
AC1_Mystery_2_3_00126	What the heck does it even mean\nfor the dolls to get along?
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00024	There's an old grand piano.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00025	There's a music stand for holding sheet music.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00026	Ugh, so nervous...
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00027	Just do your best! You'll be fine.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00028	OK... Here goes nothing.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00029	I'll try transcribing it.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00030	Done! Now let's play it!
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00032	Sorry, I must have messed it up.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00034	Sorry, I guess I messed it up.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00042	Hmm. It sounded different from\nwhat I remember Frannie playing.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00124	Hmm...
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00125	Well, the second staff is blank.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00044	What you played sounded kind of\nlonely compared to when Frannie\nplayed it.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00045	Lonely? So maybe it was missing\nan accompaniment.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00126	I bet the second staff needs\nsome notes too.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00058	The pictures of the bird in the\nGolden Bird Room and on the\nsheet music can be combined.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00059	I'll snap some photos and overlay\nthem both.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00060	First I should copy the score\nfrom the bird picture onto this\nsheet music...
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00071	There's a thick layer of dust on the keyboard.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00072	I need to set up the sheet music\nbefore trying to play.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00076	OK, I'm gonna try playing it.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00081	I wonder why the bird from the\nGolden Bird Room is drawn here.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00082	This bird drawing looks the same\nas the one in the Golden Bird\nRoom.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00083	I wonder why the same bird is\ndrawn here.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00084	There was some musical notation\ndrawn on the picture, right?
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00085	Huh.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00086	Maybe it goes with the bird\npicture?
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00087	It feels like this sheet music and\nthe music staff on the painting\nin the Golden Bird Room are\nrelated...
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00088	If you overlay them on top of\neach other, they'd become a\nsingle song...
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00089	I guess, but how would you\noverlay them like that?
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00090	I could take pictures with the\nDAS and overlay those...
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00091	That might work...
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00092	Yeah, let's try it!
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00093	The sheet music and the music\nstaff on the picture from the\nGolden Bird Room...
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00094	Maybe it'll become a single song\nif I overlay them.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00134	I should transcribe the music in\nthe photo onto the blank staff.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00095	The music sheet is filled in.\nNow let's try playing it.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00127	The music staff looks weird here.\nIt's blank, there aren't any notes\nor rests indicated.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00128	Oh, yeah. This is the only place\nwithout any.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00131	There's a music staff without any notes.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00132	There's something weird about\nthis sheet music...
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00103	There's a painting of a hummingbird on the wall.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00105	This bird painting...
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00106	It's the same as the one on\nthe sheet music. That must\nbe important somehow.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00135	To overlay this painting with the\nsheet music...
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00107	This looks like sheet music...\nWhat's it doing here?
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00133	There's a music staff drawn at the top\nof the painting.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00108	There's a music staff drawn at the top of\nthe image.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00109	Why is there a music staff\ndrawn here?
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00110	And this bird... It's the same as\nthe bird on the sheet music.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00112	Hmm...
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00113	I wonder if the staff and the\nsheet music are related.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00122	They match up perfectly! Now I'll\ntranscribe it to the sheet music.
AC1_Mystery_2_6_00123	It's a perfect fit! Now I just need\nto transcribe it.
AC1_3_Scenario_00156	I need to check the ANOTHER\nkey's location on the DAS.
AC1_3_Scenario_00157	Hmm... West wing, second floor.\nMaybe I can use the key he gave\nme here.
AC1_3_Scenario_00158	The DAS was showing me that\nan ANOTHER key is past here.
AC1_3_Scenario_00159	It opened!
AC1_3_Scenario_00264	The bookshelf closed. I can't\nget through here anymore.
AC1_3_Scenario_00160	What's wrong, D?
AC1_3_Scenario_00161	Frannie told me something about\nthis fireplace.
AC1_3_Scenario_00162	Do you remember what?
AC1_3_Scenario_00163	No, but... I feel like it was\nsomething important.
AC1_3_Scenario_00164	Hmm... Oh! I think I see some light\ncoming from it.
AC1_3_Scenario_00165	Let's check it out.
AC1_3_Scenario_00166	Might be something behind it.
AC1_3_Scenario_00167	This fireplace sure is...grand.
AC1_3_Scenario_00168	There's all sorts of things here.
AC1_3_Scenario_00169	Now that I think about it, heat-\nactivated invisible ink can be\npretty dangerous, huh?
AC1_3_Scenario_00170	This newspaper's so old... I\nwonder when it's from.
AC1_3_Scenario_00171	Seems super dusty... Probably\nshouldn't mess with it.
AC1_3_Scenario_00172	There's a lot of this candle left.
AC1_3_Scenario_00173	There's a lot of this candle left.
AC1_3_Scenario_00174	That scribble from before...\nI wonder if this is where the\nhidden ink was revealed.
AC1_3_Scenario_00175	Phew. The lighter's still got some\nlife left in it.
AC1_3_Scenario_00176	Looks like it needs a bit\nmore heat...
AC1_3_Scenario_00177	The fire revealed a picture! How\nawesome.
AC1_3_Scenario_00178	But what's this symbol?
AC1_3_Scenario_00179	This picture must mean\nsomething.
AC1_3_Scenario_00180	I can't use this here.
AC1_3_Scenario_00181	What could this be?
AC1_3_Scenario_00182	Did you find something?
AC1_3_Scenario_00183	It says, "Can you solve this, D?"
AC1_3_Scenario_00184	Me?
AC1_3_Scenario_00185	Says it's from Frannie.
AC1_3_Scenario_00186	From Frannie, to me? What is it?
AC1_3_Scenario_00187	What does she mean by figuring\nit out?
AC1_3_Scenario_00188	Do you think this picture means\nsomething?
AC1_3_Scenario_00189	You got Frannie's challenge.
AC1_3_Scenario_00190	What could this be?
AC1_3_Scenario_00191	Did you find something?
AC1_3_Scenario_00192	It says, "Can you solve this, D?"
AC1_3_Scenario_00193	Me?
AC1_3_Scenario_00194	There's a picture drawn on it...\nIs that a part of the puzzle?
AC1_3_Scenario_00195	Do you think this picture means\nsomething?
AC1_3_Scenario_00196	You got Frannie's challenge.
AC1_3_Scenario_00197	What's this picture? Looks like\nit's been burnt.
AC1_3_Scenario_00198	Burnt?
AC1_3_Scenario_00199	Now I remember... This picture\nwas drawn with invisible ink!
AC1_3_Scenario_00200	Wow, really?
AC1_3_Scenario_00201	Yeah. You gotta know the trick\nto see it.
AC1_3_Scenario_00202	And in this case, the ink becomes\nvisible when exposed to heat.
AC1_3_Scenario_00203	That sounds like so much fun.
AC1_3_Scenario_00204	The paper has some burn spots.
AC1_3_Scenario_00205	The ink bottle is...totally dry!
AC1_3_Scenario_00206	So this must have had invisible\nink in it.
AC1_3_Scenario_00207	I don't need this right now.
AC1_3_Scenario_00209	Could this be...
AC1_3_Scenario_00210	I'm curious about the fireplace.
AC1_3_Scenario_00211	Did you figure out Frannie's\npuzzle, Ashley?
AC1_3_Scenario_00212	The symbol that appeared when\nwe used the fire... I wonder what\nit could be.
AC1_3_Scenario_00213	What do you think those coins\nfrom earlier are for?
AC1_3_Scenario_00214	Let's take a closer look at the\nfireplace.
AC1_3_Scenario_00215	I'm curious about this light... Is\nthere something behind the\nfireplace?
AC1_3_Scenario_00216	Pressing on it won't open it.
AC1_3_Scenario_00217	What's this metal plate?
AC1_3_Scenario_00218	Is this what the picture in\nFrannie's puzzle is?
AC1_3_Scenario_00219	I haven't found the ANOTHER\nkey yet. I should keep looking\naround this room.
AC1_3_Scenario_00220	I haven't found the ANOTHER\nkey yet. I should keep looking\naround this room.
AC1_3_Scenario_00221	I haven't found the ANOTHER\nkey yet. I should keep looking\naround this room.
AC1_3_Scenario_00222	I haven't found the ANOTHER\nkey yet. I should keep looking\naround this room.
AC1_3_Scenario_00275	It's too dark to see anything.
AC1_3_Scenario_00043	The box contains an indent shaped to fit a gun.
AC1_3_Scenario_00266	There's a small wooden box.
AC1_3_Scenario_00223	What's this bag?
AC1_3_Scenario_00224	That's...my bag...
AC1_3_Scenario_00225	Father gave it to me. I had it with\nme when I came to the island.
AC1_3_Scenario_00226	Open it for me.
AC1_3_Scenario_00227	I wonder if there's a story to go\nwith this bag.
AC1_3_Scenario_00228	Is this your hat, D?
AC1_3_Scenario_00229	Oh yeah! That was my favorite.
AC1_3_Scenario_00230	It's totally vintage. I love it.
AC1_3_Scenario_00231	It wasn't "vintage" when I was\nwearing it.
AC1_3_Scenario_00232	There's a "vintage" hat.
AC1_3_Scenario_00233	This ball looks super old. Was\nthis yours?
AC1_3_Scenario_00234	Yeah, I loved baseball.
AC1_3_Scenario_00235	Father and I played catch a lot.
AC1_3_Scenario_00236	There's a well-used baseball.
AC1_3_Scenario_00044	It's D's dad's briefcase.
AC1_3_Scenario_00045	It's D's dad's briefcase.
AC1_3_Scenario_00046	There's an old shoe.
AC1_3_Scenario_00047	This is a child's shoe.
AC1_3_Scenario_00048	That's...
AC1_3_Scenario_00049	Huh?
AC1_3_Scenario_00050	That's my shoe.
AC1_3_Scenario_00052	Why is there only one?
AC1_3_Scenario_00053	I don't know.
AC1_3_Scenario_00265	There's an old shoe.
AC1_3_Scenario_00055	There's an old notebook.
AC1_3_Scenario_00056	What do you think is written\nin it?
AC1_3_Scenario_00057	Read it.
AC1_3_Scenario_00060	There's some heavy stuff written\nin here...
AC1_3_Scenario_00061	Hm...
AC1_3_Scenario_00062	There's an old notebook.
AC1_3_Scenario_00063	Read the notebook again?
AC1_3_Scenario_00067	There's an old photo of a young couple\nwith a baby.
AC1_3_Scenario_00068	I wonder who the people in this\nphoto are.
AC1_3_Scenario_00069	That man is Father...
AC1_3_Scenario_00070	Really?
AC1_3_Scenario_00071	Then does that mean the woman\nis your mom?
AC1_3_Scenario_00072	It must, right?
AC1_3_Scenario_00073	Then the baby must be...
AC1_3_Scenario_00074	It's me.
AC1_3_Scenario_00075	There's a photo of a young couple with a baby.
AC1_3_Scenario_00076	There's a fountain pen.
AC1_3_Scenario_00077	This pen looks well used. The\nink's all dried up.
AC1_3_Scenario_00078	That pen...
AC1_3_Scenario_00079	Father cherished it.
AC1_3_Scenario_00080	So it belonged to him?
AC1_3_Scenario_00081	There's a fountain pen.
AC1_3_Scenario_00082	There's a stack of paper.
AC1_3_Scenario_00083	What is this? There's a lot\nwritten on it.
AC1_3_Scenario_00085	It looks like a novel manuscript.\nWritten by David Shields.
AC1_3_Scenario_00086	David Shields?
AC1_3_Scenario_00087	That name's somehow familiar...
AC1_3_Scenario_00088	It's a manuscript for a novel\nwritten by David Shields.
AC1_3_Scenario_00089	Read the novel manuscript again?
AC1_3_Scenario_00271	Whoa. The floor here is in\nterrible shape.
AC1_3_Scenario_00270	You're right. Be careful, Ashley.
AC1_3_Scenario_00269	R-right... Got it.
AC1_3_Scenario_00111	Does this lead to the foyer? I\nmight be able to open the door\nfrom this side.
AC1_3_Scenario_00237	There's a lock on the door.
AC1_3_Scenario_00238	I can unlock this.
AC1_3_Scenario_00112	The door opened.
AC1_3_Scenario_00113	The stairway leads down to a wooden door.
AC1_3_Scenario_00115	No good. It's locked.
AC1_3_Scenario_00116	What room is this?
AC1_3_Scenario_00118	No good. It's locked...
AC1_3_Scenario_00119	The door is locked tight.
AC1_3_Scenario_00122	It's locked.
AC1_3_Scenario_00239	D seemed really scared. I should\nget out of here.
AC1_3_Scenario_00272	The door is locked.
AC1_3_Scenario_00240	I can unlock it from this side.
AC1_3_Scenario_00241	You unlocked the door.
AC1_3_Scenario_00242	It opened!
AC1_3_Scenario_00124	There's no ANOTHER key on the\nother side of this door, is there?
AC1_3_Scenario_00243	I should stay inside the mansion\nfor now.
AC1_3_Scenario_00244	Dad's waiting in the foyer. I need\nto get back to him.
AC1_3_Scenario_00245	That's not where the voice was\ncoming from, Ashley.
AC1_3_Scenario_00246	Dad was going from the foyer to\nthe courtyard, right?
AC1_3_Scenario_00273	The key to the wine cellar must\nbe in the Silver Bird Room.
AC1_3_Scenario_00274	Let's open the wine cellar with\nthe key we found.
AC1_3_Scenario_00247	No good. It won't open.
AC1_3_Scenario_00248	Ashley.
AC1_3_Scenario_00249	We should check that chair.
AC1_3_Scenario_00250	There's a lock on the door.
AC1_3_Scenario_00251	Oh... I can unlock this!
AC1_3_Scenario_00252	The door opened.
AC1_3_Scenario_00258	The tablecloth is stained with wine.
AC1_3_Scenario_00259	These papers are all scattered.\nWhat happened here?
AC1_3_Scenario_00260	Using the ANOTHER theory, we're building a\ndevice capable of controlling memory. Once\nit's complete, we believe it will be a useful aid\nin supporting people with emotional trauma,\nlike that sustained from accidents or war.
AC1_3_Scenario_00261	This is a thesis on ANOTHER...
AC1_3_Scenario_00262	Was Dad arguing about this\nwith someone?
AC1_3_Scenario_00263	The thesis on ANOTHER is near the spilled wine.
AC1_3_Scenario_00138	There's a coat on the chair.
AC1_3_Scenario_00254	Someone left their wallet.
AC1_3_Scenario_00255	Wow, really?
AC1_3_Scenario_00140	Let's put the chair back.
AC1_3_Scenario_00256	There's a coat hung on the back of the chair.
AC1_3_Scenario_00257	Someone left their wallet.
AC1_3_Scenario_00267	There's a lock on the door.
AC1_3_Scenario_00268	I can unlock this.
AC1_3_Scenario_00151	The door opened.
AC1_3_00005	Ashley?
AC1_3_00672	*gasp*
AC1_3_00006	I'm your father.
AC1_3_00007	What?
AC1_3_00009	What do I do?
AC1_3_00011	That's... He's my dad?
AC1_3_00015	Ashley...
AC1_3_00016	Y-yeah?
AC1_3_00017	Look at you, all grown up.
AC1_3_00018	I...
AC1_3_00019	I've been waiting for you\nto arrive.
AC1_3_00021	I don't know what to say.
AC1_3_00023	There's so much I've always\nwished I could tell him...
AC1_3_00025	I can't even think straight...
AC1_3_00027	My heart feels like it's going to\npound out of my chest...
AC1_3_00029	I've got a lump in my throat.\nI can't talk...
AC1_3_00032	I don't know what to say.
AC1_3_00033	Just seeing you in front of me...\nIt's...it's a little overwhelming.
AC1_3_00034	Dad...
AC1_3_00036	Ashley...
AC1_3_00038	This is so weird...
AC1_3_00040	When he hugs me, I\nsmell cigarettes...
AC1_3_00042	This man... He's my dad.
AC1_3_00044	I finally met my dad.
AC1_3_00054	Dad... Where's Jessica?
AC1_3_00055	Hmm...
AC1_3_00056	Well...
AC1_3_00057	I haven't seen her.
AC1_3_00058	How is that possible?
AC1_3_00059	Did Jessica let you wander off?
AC1_3_00061	No... She told me to stay put.
AC1_3_00062	I was being a brat, so she\nprobably wanted to get away\nfrom me.
AC1_3_00064	I tried to catch up to her,\nbut I couldn't.
AC1_3_00065	Then when I got near the\nmansion, I heard her scream.
AC1_3_00066	I found her glasses on the\nground by the gate.
AC1_3_00067	What?
AC1_3_00069	I didn't hear anything.
AC1_3_00070	Why didn’t you come to the dock\nto meet us?
AC1_3_00071	Well, I was... I...
AC1_3_00072	I was conducting an experiment\nthat took longer than I expected.
AC1_3_00073	I'm sorry, Ashley.
AC1_3_00074	*sigh*
AC1_3_00075	OK...
AC1_3_00076	I guess it was too important to\nwalk away from, huh?
AC1_3_00077	I'm really worried about Jessica.\nIf you haven't seen her either...
AC1_3_00078	We have to look for her!
AC1_3_00080	Of course I'll help look\nfor Jessica.
AC1_3_00089	By the way...
AC1_3_00090	Did you bring the DAS?
AC1_3_00091	Yeah.
AC1_3_00092	I have it right here.
AC1_3_00678	Good. I'm glad you got it, Ashley.
AC1_3_00679	Why did you send it to me?
AC1_3_00680	There'll be time to explain it all\nlater. Just hold on to it for now.
AC1_3_00681	OK.
AC1_3_00682	Oh yeah... The DAS made a weird\nnoise earlier.
AC1_3_00683	What?
AC1_3_00684	The screen is...
AC1_3_00685	The system's online.
AC1_3_00094	OK. Two in the west wing and\none in the east.
AC1_3_00095	Well, that's odd. One has already\nbeen unlocked.
AC1_3_00096	Unlocked?
AC1_3_00097	Are you talking about this?
AC1_3_00099	Oh, Ashley, well done. Thank you\nfor bringing this to me.
AC1_3_00100	Where did you find it?
AC1_3_00101	It was in the piano.
AC1_3_00102	In the piano? Really?
AC1_3_00103	What is this? Why was it in\nthe piano?
AC1_3_00104	Hmm...
AC1_3_00105	It's a key that starts a very\nimportant device called\nthe <color=#00994CFF>ANOTHER</color>.
AC1_3_00107	But <color=#00994CFF>Bill</color> stole it.
AC1_3_00108	Bill?
AC1_3_00115	Who's Bill?
AC1_3_00116	A scholar who helped me with\nmy research.
AC1_3_00117	He was my assistant and is\nabsolutely brilliant. But he\nbetrayed me.
AC1_3_00118	He tried to steal the research\nwe did on this island.
AC1_3_00119	Ashley, your mother and I\ndedicated our lives to our\nresearch on ANOTHER.
AC1_3_00120	But Bill wanted to claim it\nfor himself.
AC1_3_00121	That's horrible!
AC1_3_00122	I managed to stop him, but...
AC1_3_00124	He had already hidden the keys\nfrom me.
AC1_3_00125	The ANOTHER needs keys?
AC1_3_00126	That's right.
AC1_3_00127	There are three keys total.
AC1_3_00128	The remaining two should still be\nsomewhere in this mansion.
AC1_3_00131	I see.
AC1_3_00134	What is the ANOTHER?
AC1_3_00135	Why are you out here all alone\non this island?
AC1_3_00137	And you told Jessica to tell me\nyou were dead! Why?
AC1_3_00138	Tell me everything. All of it.
AC1_3_00139	...
AC1_3_00140	ANOTHER was my and your\nmother's research project.
AC1_3_00141	Once complete, it could heal a\ngreat many people.
AC1_3_00142	It can heal people?
AC1_3_00143	That was the hope, anyway.
AC1_3_00144	But we knew there were people\nwho might try to steal it from us.
AC1_3_00145	That's why I continued my work\nhere, where no one could\nfind me.
AC1_3_00146	I thought I could trust Bill...\nBut it seems I was wrong.
AC1_3_00147	Huh...
AC1_3_00686	And I think Bill may have\ntaken Jessica.
AC1_3_00687	What?
AC1_3_00688	She's in danger. We need to find\nher right away.
AC1_3_00689	Then let's go find her! Right now!
AC1_3_00690	It's not so simple...
AC1_3_00691	I need to get the ANOTHER keys\nin order to protect it.
AC1_3_00692	Dad, we...
AC1_3_00693	What do we do?
AC1_3_00695	Let's split up. You look for\nJessica, and I'll look for the\nANOTHER keys.
AC1_3_00696	Ashley, I can't let you do that.
AC1_3_00697	I'll be OK. I can find them using\nthe DAS.
AC1_3_00698	I've already managed to solve all\nsorts of puzzles around here.
AC1_3_00699	Finding a few more keys will be\nno sweat, even if Bill's hidden\nthem.
AC1_3_00700	OK... If you're sure, I'll leave the\nkeys to you.
AC1_3_00155	Just hurry and find Jessica.
AC1_3_00156	Don't worry. I'll find her.
AC1_3_00157	...
AC1_3_00158	Hey... Dad?
AC1_3_00159	Yes?
AC1_3_00160	Once we have all the ANOTHER\nkeys...and you find Jessica...
AC1_3_00161	then we can all go home.\nTogether. Right?
AC1_3_00162	Of course.
AC1_3_00163	So the sooner you find those\nkeys the better, right?
AC1_3_00164	Uh-huh.
AC1_3_00165	Well then, you should take this.
AC1_3_00166	Where should I start looking?
AC1_3_00167	The DAS shows something on the\nsecond floor of the west wing.
AC1_3_00168	You should be able to get in\nwith that key.
AC1_3_00169	Thank you, Dad.
AC1_3_00170	Now, that place is dark, so\nbe careful.
AC1_3_00171	I'm sure I'll find Jessica soon.\nMeet you in the foyer?
AC1_3_00172	Deal.
AC1_3_00173	OK. I'm off.
AC1_3_00174	Good luck.
AC1_3_00180	Ashley?
AC1_3_00181	Huh? What?
AC1_3_00182	I'm glad you finally got to meet\nyour father.
AC1_3_00183	Yeah...
AC1_3_00184	You don't seem very happy.\nIs something wrong?
AC1_3_00185	No, I'm happy.
AC1_3_00186	But...I don't know. I've got this\nweird feeling...
AC1_3_00187	You probably just need a chance\nto take it all in.
AC1_3_00188	Yeah. Maybe that's it.
AC1_3_00189	Dad couldn't see you.
AC1_3_00190	That's because he only believes\nwhat he can see.
AC1_3_00191	Like every other adult.
AC1_3_00192	I'm used to not being seen.
AC1_3_00193	...
AC1_3_00194	So, are you going to help\nyour father?
AC1_3_00195	Of course.
AC1_3_00196	I want to help if I can.
AC1_3_00197	So, yeah, I'm gonna find the\nANOTHER keys for him.
AC1_3_00198	I see.
AC1_3_00199	Will you help me, D?
AC1_3_00200	I would be happy to.
AC1_3_00703	It's pitch black in here... Smells\nkind of damp too.
AC1_3_00704	It's been neglected all this time.
AC1_3_00705	Is there really an ANOTHER key\nhidden in here?
AC1_3_00706	Let's double-check on the DAS.
AC1_3_00708	It's showing me a room deeper in.
AC1_3_00709	There may be something behind\nthe bookshelf...
AC1_3_00710	But it's so dark. I can't just go\nfumbling around blind in there.
AC1_3_00711	I'll check out what's past here.
AC1_3_00713	Ah, D!
AC1_3_00715	This way, Ashley!
AC1_3_00718	Did I mention I'm sort of scared\nof the dark?
AC1_3_00721	The floor collapsed...
AC1_3_00722	Ugh, this mansion's a deathtrap.\nDad's really been living here all\nalong?
AC1_3_00723	Now, where did D go?
AC1_3_00726	Oh, this is...
AC1_3_00727	I've enjoyed reading books here\never since I was young.
AC1_3_00728	I wanted to be a novelist.
AC1_3_00730	Come on, D, where are you...
AC1_3_00731	Hmm... So to get over the hole\nto the other side...
AC1_3_00733	Huh?
AC1_3_00735	The bookshelf is crooked. It's a\nlittle wobbly...
AC1_3_00738	Maybe I can knock this over...
AC1_3_00740	Ah!
AC1_3_00742	OK, that was dangerous...
AC1_3_00743	Ashley, are you OK?!
AC1_3_00745	Uh, yeah! I'm fine!
AC1_3_00746	D sounds like he's farther in.
AC1_3_00747	I can use the bookshelf to get\nacross now.
AC1_3_00748	Though, it seems pretty unstable.\nThis is so scary...
AC1_3_00751	Phew, there he is!
AC1_3_00753	D!
AC1_3_00754	Oh, Ashley!
AC1_3_00755	So glad I finally found you.
AC1_3_00756	I've been here before, with my\nfather.
AC1_3_00757	He took me past the bookshelf.
AC1_3_00759	The room extends beyond it.
AC1_3_00760	And the ANOTHER key is there.\nI'm sure of it.
AC1_3_00763	Oh man... The bookshelf really\nmoved!
AC1_3_00766	Oh no!
AC1_3_00767	D!
AC1_3_00769	Great, it closed... Now what do\nI do?
AC1_3_00771	Ugh, it won't open.
AC1_3_00773	Does this mean we're stuck?
AC1_3_00774	Eek!
AC1_3_00775	Don't scare me like that!
AC1_3_00772	Ugh, forget it.
AC1_3_00777	Let's just find this key.
AC1_3_00779	According to this, it's nearby...\nThere's a room even deeper in?
AC1_3_00782	That's...
AC1_3_00783	Did you find something?
AC1_3_00785	Hey, wait up!
AC1_3_00789	What was that sound?
AC1_3_00791	Figures there was some trick to\nthis fireplace.
AC1_3_00794	Whoa...
AC1_3_00795	Whoa...
AC1_3_00797	Guess we should go through.
AC1_3_00250	A secret room behind a fireplace\nis just next-level.
AC1_3_00251	It's unbelievable.
AC1_3_00253	Have you been in here before?
AC1_3_00254	No. At least, not that I recall.
AC1_3_00259	There is a small wooden box.
AC1_3_00260	What is this?
AC1_3_00262	It's empty...
AC1_3_00265	*gasp*
AC1_3_00901	Father?
AC1_3_00266	What is it, D?
AC1_3_00267	I just remembered something.
AC1_3_00268	Father opened this case...\nHe kind of stared into it...
AC1_3_00269	And inside it was... There was a...
AC1_3_00271	A gun. 
AC1_3_00799	But where could it be now?
AC1_3_00801	Looks like a letter. Wonder what\nit says.
AC1_3_00802	　　　　Nov 28th, 1948\nDear D,\n\n　Happy 12th birthday!\n　You're the first friend I made on this\n　island. I'm so happy I get to celebrate\n　your birthday!\n　I hope we get to keep having lots of\n　fun together.\n\nFrom Frannie
AC1_3_00803	This was from Frannie to me?
AC1_3_00804	That must be it...
AC1_3_00805	It's a birthday card from Frannie\nto you!
AC1_3_00806	...
AC1_3_00807	You don't remember?
AC1_3_00808	No, I don't.
AC1_3_00809	But this card was probably\nwritten on my birthday, right?
AC1_3_00810	Which means now you know when\nyour birthday is!
AC1_3_00811	Yeah, you're right.
AC1_3_00815	Looks like a letter.
AC1_3_00817	This is a birthday card from\nFrannie to D.
AC1_3_00842	It's the ANOTHER key!
AC1_3_00845	Now we have two!
AC1_3_00847	That means there's just one more\nto find.
AC1_3_00849	...
AC1_3_00851	What's the matter, D?
AC1_3_00853	The things in here were all\nimportant to Father.
AC1_3_00855	Let's take a look and see what he\nkept in here.
AC1_3_00293	I can't get it open...
AC1_3_00295	What is it, D?
AC1_3_00296	I'm scared... Just all of a sudden.
AC1_3_00297	Ghosts can get scared?
AC1_3_00298	We need to go. I want to go. Now.\nFar away from here.
AC1_3_00299	OK. Sure. Let's get out of here.
AC1_3_00300	*whimper*
AC1_3_00303	Where are we now?
AC1_3_00306	Whoa... You could cook for a\nhundred people at once in here.
AC1_3_00308	They must have had a\nfancy chef.
AC1_3_00309	Just being in here is making me\nhungry...
AC1_3_00310	I just remembered something.
AC1_3_00311	We had turkey the first time\nI came to this island.
AC1_3_00312	Turkey? Now I'm hungry-jealous.
AC1_3_00326	A family used to gather around\nthis table to eat together...
AC1_3_00857	What's that?
AC1_3_00858	I wonder who left this lying\naround.
AC1_3_00859	Is that...Mom?
AC1_3_00336	Looks like a newspaper clipping.
AC1_3_00337	But what's it about?
AC1_3_00342	What? The—
AC1_3_00343	Mom was murdered?
AC1_3_00344	And Dad was a suspect?
AC1_3_00345	Was Jessica hiding this?
AC1_3_00347	Oh!
AC1_3_00358	I'm not giving you the ANOTHER!
AC1_3_00364	Oh, Mom...
AC1_3_00861	Is something the matter, Ashley?
AC1_3_00863	Um...
AC1_3_00865	Uh, n-no, it's nothing.
AC1_3_00370	What's this room?
AC1_3_00371	The lounge... It's where Father\nused to drink.
AC1_3_00372	The next ANOTHER key is in here.
AC1_3_00376	There's static coming from the radio.
AC1_3_00377	Oh, it's the radio. It's not tuned\nto anything.
AC1_3_00378	No, I can...
AC1_3_00379	What's up?
AC1_3_00380	I can hear music mixed in with\nthe static.
AC1_3_00381	Really?
AC1_3_00383	Huh. I can't hear it.
AC1_3_00866	I can... And I've heard this\nsomewhere before.
AC1_3_00867	Can you help me hear it more\nclearly? Please.
AC1_3_00384	Maybe if I tune it...
AC1_3_00390	I know this song. It's what we\nplayed on the piano earlier.
AC1_3_00391	I remember it now.
AC1_3_00392	The Miracle of the Blue Moon.
AC1_3_00393	What?
AC1_3_00394	It's the title of the song...
AC1_3_00395	It was quite popular...long before\nyou were born...
AC1_3_00396	Oh.
AC1_3_00397	Father loved this song...
AC1_3_00398	Can I listen to it for a moment?
AC1_3_00399	Of course.
AC1_3_00402	Aw, it ended...
AC1_3_00408	What the...
AC1_3_00411	It's an ANOTHER key!
AC1_3_00412	Hidden in the radio? I'd never\nhave imagined that.
AC1_3_00428	That's the third one.
AC1_3_00429	So you found all three.
AC1_3_00430	I hope Dad will be happy.
AC1_3_00431	I'm sure he will be.
AC1_3_00432	Let's take the keys to him.
AC1_3_00433	He said he'd be waiting in\nthe foyer.
AC1_3_00871	Just one more ANOTHER key\nto go.
AC1_3_00872	Where in the world is it hiding?
AC1_3_00876	I wonder if Dad found Jessica.
AC1_3_00877	There he is.
AC1_3_00439	Dad!
AC1_3_00878	Did you find Jessica?
AC1_3_00879	No, not yet.
AC1_3_00880	Oh...
AC1_3_00440	More importantly...
AC1_3_00441	Did you find the ANOTHER keys?
AC1_3_00442	Sure did! Check it out.
AC1_3_00445	You found all three. Excellent\nwork, Ashley.
AC1_3_00451	Now hand them over.
AC1_3_00452	W-wait...
AC1_3_00453	The keys. Now.
AC1_3_00882	Hey...Dad?
AC1_3_00883	Let's go look for Jessica first...\nWe can go together.
AC1_3_00884	No. Restarting ANOTHER comes\nfirst.
AC1_3_00885	Give me the keys, Ashley.
AC1_3_00886	U-um, OK...
AC1_3_00888	If you say so...
AC1_3_00458	But...I wanted to ask you\na few things first.
AC1_3_00459	Things? What things?
AC1_3_00460	I was so young when you left\nI can't even remember you.
AC1_3_00461	I know nothing about you, Dad...
AC1_3_00462	I'd just like to talk. You know...\nLike we're a family. 
AC1_3_00463	All right.
AC1_3_00464	But be quick.
AC1_3_00465	Oh, OK...
AC1_3_00467	What should I ask first?
AC1_3_00468	I can't decide. There's too much...
AC1_3_00469	<color=#00994CFF>Jessica</color>. <color=#00994CFF>ANOTHER</color>. This weird old\nmansion. And...
AC1_3_00471	That newspaper article.
AC1_3_00499	So we have the keys. But what is\nANOTHER anyway?
AC1_3_00500	You said ANOTHER is something\nthat might heal people?
AC1_3_00501	It is exactly that.
AC1_3_00502	And the secret of ANOTHER is\nthat it alters memories.
AC1_3_00503	That's how it can heal people,\nby adjusting or removing painful\nmemories. We could even\ncure PTSD!
AC1_3_00504	With this machine we can read\nand write directly to the brain's\nneurology, like it's a hard drive.
AC1_3_00505	Um...
AC1_3_00506	Oh, it's a waste of time explaining\nsomething you can't understand.
AC1_3_00507	...
AC1_3_00509	I don't understand the details,\nbut it sounds amazing.
AC1_3_00510	Amazing. That's one word for it.
AC1_3_00511	So "amazing" that your mother...
AC1_3_00513	dedicated her life to its\nresearch.
AC1_3_00515	Her life?
AC1_3_00516	She believed that ANOTHER was...
AC1_3_00517	She believed it was worth\nprotecting at all costs.
AC1_3_00522	Come along, Ashley. I'll show\nyou ANOTHER.
AC1_3_00523	It's a grand piece of work left\nbehind by <color=#00994CFF>Sayoko</color>.
AC1_3_00524	I don't know if I want to see it.
AC1_3_00528	Aren't you worried\nabout Jessica?
AC1_3_00531	You said you'd go looking.
AC1_3_00532	I did.
AC1_3_00533	And I will find her.
AC1_3_00534	Once we've finished\nactivating ANOTHER.
AC1_3_00535	...
AC1_3_00539	When I was hunting for the keys,\nI found this newspaper article.
AC1_3_00541	Article? What article?
AC1_3_00543	It says...
AC1_3_00544	Dad, it says you...
AC1_3_00545	What is it?
AC1_3_00546	It says you're a suspect in\nMom's murder.
AC1_3_00547	...
AC1_3_00548	And just where did you find that?
AC1_3_00549	It was in a wallet I found in the\ndining hall.
AC1_3_00550	I see...
AC1_3_00551	Hmm...
AC1_3_00552	It says you... The things in this\narticle are just...
AC1_3_00553	Can you remember what\nhappened that night?
AC1_3_00554	Sort of? I dream about it, but...
AC1_3_00555	Tell me about the dream.
AC1_3_00556	I'm three years old. I'm crying in\na closet...
AC1_3_00557	And then someone says my name.
AC1_3_00558	Do you know who it is?
AC1_3_00559	No.
AC1_3_00560	That's always when the\ndream ends.
AC1_3_00677	...
AC1_3_00562	I wasn't the one who shot her.
AC1_3_00563	Oh... That's...good.
AC1_3_00889	That you didn't do it, I mean.\nIt's just...
AC1_3_00890	I didn't know she'd been shot.
AC1_3_00891	...
AC1_3_00892	But why... And who?
AC1_3_00564	Her murderer was never found.
AC1_3_00893	...
AC1_3_00573	When all of this is over...
AC1_3_00574	Yes? What?
AC1_3_00575	When this is over, me and\nJessica and you...
AC1_3_00576	We can go home. Together.\nRight?
AC1_3_00577	As long as we can complete\nANOTHER, yes.
AC1_3_00578	...
AC1_3_00579	What is it?
AC1_3_00580	I know ANOTHER was an amazing\nachievement...
AC1_3_00581	and maybe it can help heal a lot\nof people.
AC1_3_00582	But...
AC1_3_00583	ANOTHER is the reason Mom was\nkilled, right?
AC1_3_00584	I guess that freaks me out a bit.
AC1_3_00585	I just want to live a normal life\nwith you, Dad. That's all.
AC1_3_00586	...
AC1_3_00587	So let's go find Jessica and get\noff this island. All three of us.
AC1_3_00594	I think we need to prioritize\nfinding Jessica over your\nexperiments with ANOTHER.
AC1_3_00595	She might be in trouble.\nPlease, Dad?
AC1_3_00597	No!
AC1_3_00599	What?
AC1_3_00601	Ashley...
AC1_3_00602	Completing ANOTHER was your\nmother's greatest wish.
AC1_3_00603	I can't leave this island without\nfinishing our work.
AC1_3_00604	But, Dad...
AC1_3_00605	I must finish ANOTHER.
AC1_3_00606	Dad, forget about it! ANOTHER\nisn't as important to me as you.
AC1_3_00607	Please, just come home with me\nand Jessica!
AC1_3_00613	That's enough out of you!
AC1_3_00614	...
AC1_3_00615	Why don't you listen to me?
AC1_3_00616	I don't have anything else!\nANOTHER is all I have left!
AC1_3_00621	Why don't you listen to me?!
AC1_3_00624	...
AC1_3_00626	...
AC1_3_00628	I'm nothing to him, is that it?
AC1_3_00629	I'm sorry I yelled at you.
AC1_3_00630	But I need you to stop making\nmore problems for me.
AC1_3_00631	Now give me the ANOTHER keys.
AC1_3_00632	Dad...
AC1_3_00633	OK. Fine.
AC1_3_00634	I won't interrupt your time with\nANOTHER anymore.
AC1_3_00635	Hm.
AC1_3_00637	Here they are.
AC1_3_00638	Can't do your important\nresearch without them.
AC1_3_00640	Dad.
AC1_3_00641	Hm?
AC1_3_00642	I need to go prep ANOTHER for\nboot up.
AC1_3_00643	Stay here until I'm done with it.
AC1_3_00673	Tch...
AC1_3_00646	*inhale*
AC1_3_00648	Dad...
AC1_3_00650	He doesn't care about me or Jessica...
AC1_3_00651	He doesn't care at all.
AC1_3_00652	That man...
AC1_3_00653	He might be Richard Robins...
AC1_3_00654	Jessica's brother...
AC1_3_00676	the person my mom married...
AC1_3_00655	but he's not my dad.
AC1_3_00656	Someone like that couldn't be.
AC1_3_00657	I don't wanna be in this messed-up place.
AC1_3_00658	I wanna go home.
AC1_3_00659	I wanna find Jessica and just...go home.
AC1_3_00661	Hey, D? I...
AC1_3_00675	*gasp*
AC1_3_00663	I remember Father.
AC1_3_00665	He was killed in this mansion.
AC1_3_00895	For real?!
AC1_3_00896	Yes... In the Silver Bird Room.
AC1_3_00667	*gasp*
AC1_3_00899	(Exert Noise)
AC1_3_00900	(Exert Noise)
AC1_3_00671	D?
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00015	I'll go with you.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00016	I'll take a look ahead.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00017	Er...all right, D!
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00114	There's a candle in the candleholder.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00018	Phew, some light...
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00019	This is a candleholder.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00020	Lighting the candle will brighten\nup the room.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00021	But how can I light it?
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00022	I saw an ashtray in another\nroom...
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00023	Maybe I can find something to\nlight this candle with in there.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00024	This is a candleholder.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00025	That helps shine a light on\nthe subject.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00026	This candle could be useful in\nother places too.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00027	Take the candle?
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00031	This is a candleholder.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00032	Looks like there's no candle in it.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00033	Maybe I can find a candle...
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00034	I've already used the candles\nI found.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00035	Guess I gotta take one out of a\ndifferent candleholder.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00041	Nice, some candles.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00104	Books are scattered on the floor.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00115	Some things are scattered on the floor.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00116	It's so dark. I can't see a thing.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00117	Some things are scattered on the floor.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00057	There must be an ANOTHER key\npast here.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00061	Maybe there's something on this\nbookshelf...
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00062	There's something written on it.\n"The two birds know the order."
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00067	Hmm... These books...
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00068	I should check it out.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00071	Nothing happened.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00072	Maybe there are some clues.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00073	Nothing's happening.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00074	"The two birds know the order."\nWhat could that mean?
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00106	Nothing's happening...
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00107	The same books were over there.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00108	Are they related?
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00109	This must be wrong.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00110	The "two birds know the order,"\nhuh? Does that mean I should\narrange the books in that order?
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00122	It's too dark to see if\nthere's anything useful\non this bookshelf.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00123	It's too dark to see the bookshelf.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00088	Bird decorations...
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00089	Why is this the only bookshelf\ndecorated like this?
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00111	"The two birds know the order."\nCould that be these two birds?
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00092	The books on this shelf have\nhearts and clovers on them...\nPretty cool design.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00112	"The two birds know the order."\nIs it talking about these books?
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00113	Maybe I need to match the order.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00119	It's a dead end.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00120	There are some ornaments on\nthis bookshelf. Looks like birds.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00121	The bookshelf is adorned with ornaments of\nwhat look birds.
AC1_Mystery_3_1_00118	It looks dangerous past here.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00029	There are slots where coins can be inserted.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00030	Which coin should I put in there?
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00031	Maybe the half-moon coin...
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00032	Maybe the crescent-moon coin...
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00033	Maybe the full-moon coin...
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00034	Maybe the waning-gibbous\nmoon coin...
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00035	Maybe the new-moon coin...
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00036	You can't use this here.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00100	There's a brass scale on the desk.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00209	This scale sure is fancy.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00210	There's something on the plate.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00211	Looks like some coins.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00108	You got the Half-Moon Coin.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00109	You got the Full-Moon Coin.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00110	You got the Crescent-Moon Coin.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00111	You got the Waning-Gibbous Moon Coin.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00112	You got the New-Moon Coin.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00114	There's a brass scale on the desk.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00115	Some coins sit on a scale.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00116	I should take this coin with me.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00117	It's a plate with a moon on it.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00119	The half-moon coin tilts it\nlike this...
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00120	The crescent-moon coin will...
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00121	The full-moon coin's weight will...
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00122	The waning-gibbous moon coin\nwill tilt it like this.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00123	The new-moon coin tilts\nit like this.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00124	I don't need to weigh this one.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00125	This one looks like a sun.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00126	Take a look at the scale. There's\nsomething on the pedestal.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00127	Oh, yeah. Are these moons?
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00128	Looks like there are five total.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00129	It must mean something, right?
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00130	The symbol just moved.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00131	Looks like it needs to be weighed\ndown with something.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00132	Trying something else to see\nwhat a different weight does!
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00212	This is shaped like a scale.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00213	What are these three things\nlined up here?
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00214	I wonder what this symbol is...
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00215	It's a fireplace.
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00216	I wonder if the symbols the heat\nrevealed are related to the\ndecoration on the fireplace...
AC1_Mystery_3_2_00146	Scientist's Inexplicable Death\n\n On the 25th at precisely midnight, Dr.\nSayoko Robins (28), a researcher at J.C.\nValley, was found dead in her home,\nhaving suffered a gunshot wound to her\nchest.\n Her daughter Ashley (3) was found in the\ncloset, close to where her mother's body\nhad fallen. The child was unharmed.\n The scene was discovered by Dr. Sayoko\nRobins's husband, Dr. Richard Robins (30).\nThe police took him into custody as a\nsuspect for questioning.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00160	Ashley...
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00161	This is my father's briefcase.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00162	It belonged to Thomas?
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00163	Can you open it?
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00164	No, it's locked.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00165	I wonder what the combination\ncould be.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00167	This one's open. I should unlock\nthe other one.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00166	All right! Now for the other one.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00058	Awesome, the briefcase lock\nis open!
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00059	My birthday was the key?
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00060	Your dad must have really cared\nfor you, D.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00061	Father...
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00062	Let's open it up.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00063	Go for it.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00064	Oh no, it won't open... Maybe I\nput in the wrong number?
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00065	There's a briefcase. It looks pretty old.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00066	I wonder what sort of number\nFather used to lock it...
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00067	Maybe the birthday of someone\nimportant to him?
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00068	I wonder what the numbers to\nunlock it are.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00069	Maybe there's a hint somewhere.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00070	I wonder what the numbers to\nunlock it are.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00071	It's gotta be something like\nsomeone's birthday.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00077	I wonder what the numbers to\nunlock it are.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00078	It's gotta be something like\nsomeone's birthday.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00159	Someone important to Thomas...\nI wonder if it could be...
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00140	Looks like a recipe for a whole\nmeal. Turkey, birthday cake...
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00141	Oh, that's what I ate! It was so\ndelicious.
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00142	Ugh, so jealous...
AC1_Mystery_3_4_00158	There are some kitchen tools on the counter.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00016	There's an old radio on the counter.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00034	Ugh, I just can't get the hang of\ntuning this thing.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00035	Don't give up. You'll get it.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00036	OK, OK... I'll keep trying.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00087	Hmm... Maybe the needle should\nbe at a different color?
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00040	I wonder if the dials will move\nthe meter.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00088	These two dials are similar.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00089	Maybe I should adjust this...
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00041	I wonder what this dial does.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00090	These two dials are similar.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00091	Maybe I should adjust this...
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00042	I wonder what this dial does.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00051	There's a radio.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00092	What's this dial?
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00052	It looks different than\nthe others.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00093	Maybe I'll be able to hear the\nsong if I move the meter.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00053	There are numbers on the meter.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00076	The top-right light lit up!
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00077	That must mean this dial's in\nthe right spot.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00078	But I still hear static.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00079	Let's try turning the other dials\nto clear it up.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00080	It lit up again. Maybe this is the\nright spot.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00081	But I still hear static.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00082	I should try the other dials.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00083	The static's gone! I can hear the\nsong better now.
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00084	I wanna hear it a little better,\nthough. Let's get it to a good\nspot...
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00085	The static's gone, but...
AC1_Mystery_3_9_00086	You could try turning the other\ndial too.
AC1_4_Scenario_00001	It's unlocked.
AC1_4_Scenario_00002	Huh? It was locked before...
AC1_4_Scenario_00003	Dad must have left it unlocked.
AC1_4_Scenario_00244	I don't want to see Dad\nright now.
AC1_4_Scenario_00245	I don't want to see Dad\nright now.
AC1_4_Scenario_00246	I don't really want to see Dad\nright now, but...I guess I don't\nhave much choice.
AC1_4_Scenario_00247	Let's find the key in the\ncourtyard.
AC1_4_Scenario_00248	It's unlocked. Dad must have\ngone through here.
AC1_4_Scenario_00004	There's an old grand piano.
AC1_4_Scenario_00005	D remembered Frannie when he\nsaw this piano.
AC1_4_Scenario_00006	He looked so happy while he was\ntalking about her.
AC1_4_Scenario_00007	Now that I'm taking a closer look\nat this piano...
AC1_4_Scenario_00008	It's old, but it's been kept in good\ncondition. It sounds great, tuned\nand everything.
AC1_4_Scenario_00009	Has Dad been taking care of it?
AC1_4_Scenario_00010	Does he even play the piano?
AC1_4_Scenario_00011	Bill stole the ANOTHER key from\nDad and hid it here.
AC1_4_Scenario_00012	He knew the trick to this sheet\nmusic's puzzle.
AC1_4_Scenario_00013	Sure seems like he knows a lot\nabout this mansion...
AC1_4_Scenario_00014	But how? Why?
AC1_4_Scenario_00020	There's a document in the bag.
AC1_4_Scenario_00021	What's this paper?
AC1_4_Scenario_00022	"Research into ANOTHER."
AC1_4_Scenario_00023	Authors Richard Robins...and\nSayoko Robins?
AC1_4_Scenario_00024	This is the research paper my\nparents wrote.
AC1_4_Scenario_00025	But it's just the cover page.
AC1_4_Scenario_00040	1916\n\n   We finally learned of Master Leonard's\nwhereabouts, but it was too late. He had\nalready succumbed to the epidemic. It has\nbeen decided that Mr. Edward will take in\nthe two children he left behind.\n   Mr. Edward has ordered new rooms to\nbe prepared for the young children. He\ncalls the rooms the Golden Bird Room and\nthe Silver Bird Room.
AC1_4_Scenario_00041	1930\n\n   The two boys have long since outgrown me.\nThey are now strapping young men. Masters\nThomas and Henry have entered the same\nuniversity.\n   Master Henry, so wise and strong.\n   Master Thomas, sweet and honest.\n   I'm sure Mr. Edward is indescribably\nproud of their growth. Now there is no longer\na concern about finding a successor.
AC1_4_Scenario_00042	1936\n\n   Masters Henry and Thomas both marry.
AC1_4_Scenario_00043	December 1943\n\n   The dreaded day has finally come. Masters\nHenry and Thomas are both headed to the\nbattlefield. The war has intensified, and both\nyoung men were called to the front lines.\n   When I think about how Mr. Edward\nmust feel, I am speechless. I can only pray for\ntheir safety.
AC1_4_Scenario_00044	September 1945\n\n   The long-awaited day has arrived. Both\nyoung masters have come home. The joy I\nfeel to have them return alive is\nunparalleled.\n   They return, however, bearing grave\nwounds to both body and soul.\n   Master Henry locks himself in the art\nstudio, gazing endlessly at the pieces he\nonce painted. He even struggles with daily\nmatters, such as eating.\n   Mr. Edward has keenly observed that\nhelp is needed and has arranged for\nHenry to stay on the island with his\nfamily.\n   After staying with us for several days,\nMaster Thomas returned to his home on\nthe mainland. He conducted himself with\nhis customary positive manner, but I could\nsense something like a dark cloud in his\ncountenance.\n   I cannot possibly understand their\nfeelings, but I pray they can rest and\nbecome well soon.
AC1_4_Scenario_00045	1946\n\n   Mr. Edward prepared his last will and\ntestament. 
AC1_4_Scenario_00046	1948\n\n   Mr. Edward has taken ill.
AC1_4_Scenario_00047	   What have I done? If only I hadn't written\nthat letter and called them to the island.\n   But no matter how I repent, those days\nwill never return. It's all my doing. The fault\nis mine alone.\n   But, perhaps, one day a descendant of\nthe Edward family will return. Should that\nhappen, I will leave a set of blueprints in\nmy drawer. I hope that they are found and\nprovide some use.\n   I pray that the souls of Mr. Edward\nand the others rest peacefully for eternity.
AC1_4_Scenario_00048	The display shelf is decorated with\nsilver tableware.
AC1_4_Scenario_00049	Wells cherished these.
AC1_4_Scenario_00050	I'm obsessed with how gorgeous\nthese plates are. Wells must have\nfelt the same.
AC1_4_Scenario_00051	I bet he thought of each person\nas he polished each piece.
AC1_4_Scenario_00052	I bet Wells knew everything\nthere was to know about this\nmansion.
AC1_4_Scenario_00073	There's a teapot and teacup on the table.
AC1_4_Scenario_00074	What a pretty tea set.
AC1_4_Scenario_00075	Huh, it looks clean... No dust or\nanything. Was someone using it?
AC1_4_Scenario_00077	There's a teapot and teacup on the table.
AC1_4_Scenario_00078	I can see the ocean.
AC1_4_Scenario_00079	I didn't know a single thing about\nDad when I got here.
AC1_4_Scenario_00080	But now... I feel like I know even\nless about him.
AC1_4_Scenario_00081	*sigh*
AC1_4_Scenario_00082	I need to hurry and find D.
AC1_4_Scenario_00083	You can see the ocean through the window\nand hear waves crashing in the distance.
AC1_4_Scenario_00084	There's a drawing on the table.
AC1_4_Scenario_00085	Dad drew this picture of what he\nimagined I looked like.
AC1_4_Scenario_00087	I guess he thought of me once in\na while after all...
AC1_4_Scenario_00089	...
AC1_4_Scenario_00090	Does this picture really look like\nme? D seems to think so.
AC1_4_Scenario_00091	There's a drawing on the table.
AC1_4_Scenario_00110	A canvas sits on the easel. It's a painting of a\nmoonlit cove.
AC1_4_Scenario_00111	This is such a beautiful painting,\nbut the more I look at it...
AC1_4_Scenario_00112	the more lonely I feel...\nWhy is that?
AC1_4_Scenario_00114	A canvas sits on the easel. It's a painting of a\nmoonlit cove.
AC1_4_Scenario_00115	There's an old, faded sketch of a young girl on\nthe easel.
AC1_4_Scenario_00116	It's a sketch of Frannie.
AC1_4_Scenario_00117	D and Frannie were pretty close.
AC1_4_Scenario_00118	I wonder if he's been able to\nremember everything about her.
AC1_4_Scenario_00119	There's an old sketch of a young girl on\nthe easel.
AC1_4_Scenario_00120	The teddy bear... I can't look at\nthis right now.
AC1_4_Scenario_00121	It'll just bring back memories\nof Mom.
AC1_4_Scenario_00122	There's an old teddy bear.
AC1_4_Scenario_00123	There was a doll inside.
AC1_4_Scenario_00124	It was missing its right arm—\na doll of Frannie's dad, Henry.
AC1_4_Scenario_00125	There are some building blocks in the box.
AC1_4_Scenario_00126	There was a key in here.
AC1_4_Scenario_00127	It was the key to the Golden Bird\nRoom.
AC1_4_Scenario_00128	Frannie's faded ribbon sits inside the drawer.
AC1_4_Scenario_00129	This room is where Henry and\nMarie spent their time.
AC1_4_Scenario_00130	I wonder if Marie knew that\nThomas was killed.
AC1_4_Scenario_00131	Oh yeah...
AC1_4_Scenario_00250	I found Marie's letter in here.
AC1_4_Scenario_00133	   You've gone and upset a lot of people\nwith this.\n   The workers here just don't get it, and\nneither do I. We put our blood, sweat, and\ntears into working Lawrence Mine 'round\nthe clock, and what are we getting in\nreturn?\n   Fired, the lot of us, and kicked off the\nisland.\n   The old president would have at least\ntried to work something out with us, like\nalways. But now this new guy gets to stroll\nin and shut us down with a single sheet\nof paper?\n   We would like a sit-down with the new\npresident. We're at least owed an\nexplanation.\n   Robert Martin\n   Worker Representative
AC1_4_Scenario_00134	It's a letter from someone who\nworked at the mines here.
AC1_4_Scenario_00135	Who's this new president?
AC1_4_Scenario_00143	This is the Golden Bird Room.
AC1_4_Scenario_00144	Wells wrote about it in his\njournal.
AC1_4_Scenario_00145	Lawrence gave Henry and\nThomas their own rooms.
AC1_4_Scenario_00146	This one was Henry's.
AC1_4_Scenario_00152	The door to a hidden room\nopened when I solved this\nfireplace's puzzle.
AC1_4_Scenario_00153	And that's where I found a\nbriefcase that belonged to\nThomas.
AC1_4_Scenario_00154	There's a well-worn baseball.
AC1_4_Scenario_00155	D said he likes baseball.
AC1_4_Scenario_00156	He used to play catch with his\ndad all the time.
AC1_4_Scenario_00157	I'm a little jealous, if I'm being\nhonest...
AC1_4_Scenario_00158	There's a well-worn baseball.
AC1_4_Scenario_00159	There's a briefcase that\nbelonged to D's dad.
AC1_4_Scenario_00160	D's shoe is in here. Just the one,\nthough...
AC1_4_Scenario_00161	Why just one?
AC1_4_Scenario_00163	This must be Thomas's journal.
AC1_4_Scenario_00164	XX/XX\n\n   I penned a mystery novel under a\npseudonym, but it still didn't sell.\n   First my child loses his mother, and now\nI can't provide him with so much as a pair\nof shoes. I never should have left the\nmansion... Maybe then I would be able to\nprovide him a better life.\n   What else can I do? I have no other\navenues for earning money.\n   All I can do now is go to my brother.
AC1_4_Scenario_00165	The child he mentions must be D.
AC1_4_Scenario_00166	There's an old picture inside the briefcase.\nIt's a young couple with a baby.
AC1_4_Scenario_00167	It's a photo of Thomas, D, and\nD's mom.
AC1_4_Scenario_00168	His parents both look so kind.
AC1_4_Scenario_00169	I wonder if D would have turned\nout like Thomas.
AC1_4_Scenario_00302	There's an old picture in the\ntrunk. It's a young couple with\na baby.
AC1_4_Scenario_00170	There's a fountain pen inside the briefcase.
AC1_4_Scenario_00171	Thomas cherished this\nfountain pen.
AC1_4_Scenario_00172	There's a fountain pen.
AC1_4_Scenario_00173	This is a really old fountain pen.
AC1_4_Scenario_00175	There's a stack of paper inside the briefcase.
AC1_4_Scenario_00176	"Scarlet Labyrinth"\nby David Shields\n\n...Before long, he emerged from the room,\nnot bothering to tidy it up. With a neutral\nexpression and nonchalant tone he told\nthe maid Monica, "The lady of the house is\nvery tired. She wishes to not be disturbed\nfor the rest of the day."\n   Monica accepted his words and cleared\nthe table of the meal she had brought out.\n   Everything was going according to plan,\nso far. He caught an unconscious smirk\nupon his face and quickly swapped it for a\nstiff look. He retrieved the black pouch he\nhad hidden under the bed...
AC1_4_Scenario_00177	It's a manuscript for a novel by\nsomeone named David Shields.
AC1_4_Scenario_00178	There's a novel manuscript inside.
AC1_4_Scenario_00179	It's a novel written by someone\nnamed David Shields.
AC1_4_Scenario_00180	Read the novel manuscript again?
AC1_4_Scenario_00195	This is where Bill hid the ANOTHER\nkey he stole from Dad.
AC1_4_Scenario_00196	He knew about the trick to the\ndoor in the fireplace...
AC1_4_Scenario_00251	Sure seems like he knows a lot\nabout this mansion...
AC1_4_Scenario_00252	But how? Why?
AC1_4_Scenario_00202	It won't open.
AC1_4_Scenario_00253	Didn't I see something like the\npicture on this door on another\ndoor too?
AC1_4_Scenario_00203	It opened!
AC1_4_Scenario_00204	This key doesn't work here.
AC1_4_Scenario_00254	Where's the key to this door?\nMaybe I should take another\nlook at what I'm carrying.
AC1_4_Scenario_00205	This won't open it.
AC1_4_Scenario_00255	The Golden Bird Room key won't\nopen it.
AC1_4_Scenario_00256	Where's the key to this room?\nMaybe I should take another\nlook at what I'm carrying.
AC1_4_Scenario_00275	It won't open.
AC1_4_Scenario_00276	Let's try opening it with the\nkey I found.
AC1_4_Scenario_00257	This mentions the Silver\nBird Room!
AC1_4_Scenario_00258	So I bet the key's still in there.
AC1_4_Scenario_00206	I saw what was in his wallet.
AC1_4_Scenario_00207	There was a newspaper clipping.\nAn article about Mom's murder...
AC1_4_Scenario_00208	Who could have killed her?
AC1_4_Scenario_00209	Dad really has no idea?
AC1_4_Scenario_00210	There's a well-worn coat.
AC1_4_Scenario_00211	An ANOTHER key was hidden\nin here.
AC1_4_Scenario_00212	Now that I think about it...
AC1_4_Scenario_00213	Why did Bill hide ANOTHER keys\nin some old mansion, anyway?
AC1_4_Scenario_00216	There's a lock on the door.
AC1_4_Scenario_00217	This door leads to the east-wing\nhallway, right?
AC1_4_Scenario_00259	Oh... I can unlock this!
AC1_4_Scenario_00260	The door opened.
AC1_4_Scenario_00218	There's a lock on the door.
AC1_4_Scenario_00219	This door leads to the west-wing\nhallway, right?
AC1_4_Scenario_00261	Oh... I can unlock this!
AC1_4_Scenario_00263	The door opened.
AC1_4_Scenario_00262	The door won't open.
AC1_4_Scenario_00264	This is the only metal door I've\nseen... I guess it was installed\nafter all the others.
AC1_4_Scenario_00265	Maybe Dad went through here.
AC1_4_Scenario_00266	The door won't open.
AC1_4_Scenario_00267	The bottle's empty.
AC1_4_Scenario_00268	The empty wine bottle is tipped over.
AC1_4_Scenario_00269	It's too dusty to see inside.
AC1_4_Scenario_00270	There are some old bottles.
AC1_4_Scenario_00271	The glass contains wine residue.
AC1_4_Scenario_00272	The glass contains wine residue.
AC1_4_Scenario_00273	There are two upside-down glasses.
AC1_4_Scenario_00274	There are two upside-down glasses.
AC1_4_Scenario_00241	This stain...
AC1_4_Scenario_00242	Father...
AC1_4_Scenario_00243	There's a dark-red stain in the carpet.
AC1_4_Scenario_00224	The bird cage has fallen over.
AC1_4_Scenario_00303	The will we found in my great-\ngrandfather's room was signed.
AC1_4_Scenario_00304	I think my father may have typed\nthis one...
AC1_4_Scenario_00305	What?
AC1_4_Scenario_00227	There's a typewriter on the desk.
AC1_4_Scenario_00228	Lawrence's will is in Thomas's typewriter.
AC1_4_Scenario_00277	What's this key doing here?
AC1_4_Scenario_00278	What do you think it goes to, D?
AC1_4_Scenario_00279	Probably the wine cellar. I think\nI remember seeing Wells use it.
AC1_4_Scenario_00280	Hey, D! Is this the key we need?
AC1_4_Scenario_00281	Yeah, Ashley! That's the key to\nthe wine cellar!
AC1_4_Scenario_00282	So we can use it to open the\ndoor we found earlier.
AC1_4_Scenario_00234	The door is locked. It won't open.
AC1_4_Scenario_00235	Looks like the wrong key.
AC1_4_Scenario_00236	This won't open it.
AC1_4_Scenario_00283	I remember now. This is the\nwine cellar.
AC1_4_Scenario_00284	My father would come here to\nfind something to drink.
AC1_4_Scenario_00285	He had to open the door\nsomehow, so he must\nhave had the key on him.
AC1_4_Scenario_00286	So maybe the key is still in the\nSilver Bird Room!
AC1_4_Scenario_00287	That's not where the voice is\ncoming from, Ashley.
AC1_4_Scenario_00292	The key to the wine cellar must\nbe in the Silver Bird Room.
AC1_4_Scenario_00293	Let's open the wine cellar with\nthe key we found.
AC1_4_Scenario_00288	That's not where the voice is\ncoming from, Ashley.
AC1_4_Scenario_00294	The key to the wine cellar must\nbe in the Silver Bird Room.
AC1_4_Scenario_00295	Let's open the wine cellar with\nthe key we found.
AC1_4_Scenario_00289	That's not where the voice is\ncoming from, Ashley.
AC1_4_Scenario_00296	The key to the wine cellar must\nbe in the Silver Bird Room.
AC1_4_Scenario_00297	Let's open the wine cellar with\nthe key we found.
AC1_4_Scenario_00290	That's not where the voice is\ncoming from, Ashley.
AC1_4_Scenario_00298	The key to the wine cellar must\nbe in the Silver Bird Room.
AC1_4_Scenario_00299	Let's open the wine cellar with\nthe key we found.
AC1_4_Scenario_00291	That's not where the voice is\ncoming from, Ashley.
AC1_4_Scenario_00300	The key to the wine cellar must\nbe in the Silver Bird Room.
AC1_4_Scenario_00301	Let's open the wine cellar with\nthe key we found.
AC1_4_Scenario_00240	An ANOTHER key was hidden in this radio.
AC1_4_00396	(Exert Noise)
AC1_4_00397	(Exert Noise)
AC1_4_00399	(Exert Noise)
AC1_4_00286	Where are you, D?
AC1_4_00287	What did you remember?
AC1_4_00289	He was killed...in the Silver Bird Room...
AC1_4_00291	D...
AC1_4_00292	What happened in the\nSilver Bird Room?
AC1_4_00294	I need to find D.
AC1_4_00039	What did D say about Wells?
AC1_4_00042	Oh yeah, that part in Wells's\njournal!
AC1_4_00043	He wrote about the Silver Bird\nRoom.
AC1_4_00044	Where did I see it last? Guess it's\ntime to get searching.
AC1_4_00094	So if the Golden Bird Room is\nhere...where's the Silver Bird\nRoom?
AC1_4_00095	Wait... Didn't I see a room like\nthis on the mansion's map?
AC1_4_00295	This must be the Silver Bird\nRoom.
AC1_4_00297	Won't open... Must be locked.
AC1_4_00298	D, are you in there? Call out if\nyou can hear me!
AC1_4_00300	Guess not... But I really thought\nhe would be.
AC1_4_00302	Maybe I can peek through the\nkeyhole.
AC1_4_00304	I knew it, he is in there!
AC1_4_00305	D, it's me!
AC1_4_00306	D!
AC1_4_00309	He won't look at me. He's just\nstaring at the floor.
AC1_4_00310	What's going on with him? Why\nwon't he just talk to me?
AC1_4_00312	Something must have happened...\nWhat should I do?
AC1_4_00313	Maybe he remembered something\nreally traumatic.
AC1_4_00314	I need to get in there.
AC1_4_00315	But how can I get the door open?
AC1_4_00317	Where could the key be?
AC1_4_00105	Whoa, this garden's seriously\nawesome.
AC1_4_00106	Look at all these flowers...
AC1_4_00107	Has Dad been taking care of\nthese or something?
AC1_4_00109	Nah, no way... He's too into his\nlab to take care of flowers.
AC1_4_00319	Whatever. That's not important\nright now.
AC1_4_00320	I need to find that key.
AC1_4_00321	There's a fountain.
AC1_4_00400	Hmm... Frannie's mom's letter\nmentioned a fountain.
AC1_4_00322	I'm coming, D...
AC1_4_00114	Should be able to find the key\nnow that the water's clean.
AC1_4_00324	Aha! There you are!
AC1_4_00327	Now I can get into the Silver\nBird Room.
AC1_4_00328	I'll be right there, D.
AC1_4_00121	Come on...come on...come onnn!
AC1_4_00125	I did it!
AC1_4_00127	I knew that would clear up\nthe water.
AC1_4_00128	I should be able to spot the key\nnow. So where are you...
AC1_4_00331	D!
AC1_4_00335	Oh, Ashley...
AC1_4_00336	Are you all right?
AC1_4_00337	You disappeared so suddenly, I\ndidn't know what was going on.
AC1_4_00338	The moment I heard your dad's\nvoice, I felt like I was about to\nremember something.
AC1_4_00339	Next thing I knew, I was here.\nIt's like I was summoned.
AC1_4_00340	But why?
AC1_4_00341	I remembered something.
AC1_4_00342	I stayed in this room with Father\nwhen I visited.
AC1_4_00343	Really?
AC1_4_00344	Wells brought a painting in that\nday...
AC1_4_00345	and he hung it here.
AC1_4_00347	He said Uncle Henry painted me.
AC1_4_00348	It made me so happy. I couldn't\nstop staring at it.
AC1_4_00349	But then Father's mood got\nworse and worse... And he\nkept drinking too.
AC1_4_00350	I was so sad to see him like that.
AC1_4_00351	So I left.
AC1_4_00352	I came back a little while later,\nand that's when...
AC1_4_00353	That's when I saw it...
AC1_4_00355	Thomas, why?!
AC1_4_00358	Father?
AC1_4_00360	Ah!
AC1_4_00362	Father was... He was <color=#00994CFF>killed</color>... Here\nin the Silver Bird Room.
AC1_4_00151	Killed? You mean your father\nwas murdered here?
AC1_4_00152	So that stain on the ground...
AC1_4_00153	Yes. That's where Father lay\nas he died.
AC1_4_00154	...
AC1_4_00156	I saw it happen.
AC1_4_00157	Father was on the floor, covered\nin blood...
AC1_4_00158	I remember a man standing next\nto him.
AC1_4_00159	There was such shock on his face\nas he looked at me...
AC1_4_00160	I can picture him now...
AC1_4_00161	It was <color=#00994CFF>Uncle Henry</color>.
AC1_4_00162	What?!
AC1_4_00166	So Henry killed Thomas?
AC1_4_00167	His own brother?
AC1_4_00168	Yeah...
AC1_4_00169	I'm sorry, D.
AC1_4_00170	Why would he...
AC1_4_00171	How could he kill his own family?
AC1_4_00173	My mom was killed in the same\nway... Someone shot her...
AC1_4_00174	So I guess...
AC1_4_00175	That's another thing you and I\nhave in common.
AC1_4_00364	D...
AC1_4_00365	Yeah...
AC1_4_00372	Ashley...
AC1_4_00374	Thank you for finding me.
AC1_4_00375	Now let's go find Jessica.
AC1_4_00377	OK.
AC1_4_00230	This looks like it's seen some use.
AC1_4_00231	That was Father's.
AC1_4_00232	He used to carry it with him in\na big case.
AC1_4_00378	There's a paper stuck in there.\nWonder what's written on it.
AC1_4_00379	Upon my death, Thomas Edward is to inherit\nthe entirety of my estate.\n\n - Lawrence Edward
AC1_4_00380	This looks like Lawrence's will.
AC1_4_00381	Seems like a pretty important\ndocument...
AC1_4_00382	Why was it left stuck in Thomas's\ntypewriter like this?
AC1_4_00255	Help... Someone...
AC1_4_00256	Hm?
AC1_4_00257	What's wrong?
AC1_4_00258	I thought I heard a voice.
AC1_4_00259	Really? Was it my dad?
AC1_4_00260	No, it was a woman's voice.
AC1_4_00261	Wait a sec! Where was the voice\ncoming from?!
AC1_4_00263	It came from below us.
AC1_4_00267	It's definitely coming from here.
AC1_4_00268	Is anyone there...
AC1_4_00269	Please... Someone...
AC1_4_00270	Is that...
AC1_4_00272	Now what? It won't open.
AC1_4_00273	There must be a key to it\nsomewhere.
AC1_4_00398	(Exert Noise)
AC1_4_00387	Jessica!
AC1_4_00390	Jessica...
AC1_5_Scenario_00001	I'll get you out of here, Jessica.
AC1_5_Scenario_00011	The door won't open.
AC1_5_Scenario_00012	Let's go up a floor.
AC1_5_Scenario_00015	All right, it opened!
AC1_5_Scenario_00016	This key won't do the trick.
AC1_5_Scenario_00017	This won't open it.
AC1_5_Scenario_00018	The two keys combined into one!
AC1_5_Scenario_00021	You can see the ocean from the window.
AC1_5_Scenario_00023	The portrait's title is displayed beneath it.\n"The Two Returned from War."
AC1_5_Scenario_00024	There's an old notebook.
AC1_5_Scenario_00026	There's something written in\nthe notebook.
AC1_5_Scenario_00027	May 1948\n\n　I feel my time drawing near. I've decided\nto record my thoughts while I'm still able\nto grasp a pen.\n　Today, I recall a day from 32 years ago...\nThe day I first held Henry and Thomas in\nmy arms. That was also the day I received\na letter of reconciliation from my son\nLeonard, who left home after rejecting the\nlife I desired for him.\n　The two young children, Henry and\nThomas, appeared while I was caught\nin a maelstrom of grief and regret. I had\njust been informed of Leonard's sudden\ndeath... Yet, I will never forget the innocent\nsmiles they wore that day.\n　I resolved then and there to raise Henry\nand Thomas myself.
AC1_5_Scenario_00028	　I loved them more than I had loved\nanyone before. I wished only for their\nlives to be filled with joy, and fulfilling\nthat wish became my sole purpose.\n　Henry and Thomas were like a pair of\nbirds who delivered joy to my life.\n　My wish was heard, both boys growing up\nhealthy and with love for one another.\nBefore long they sought to fulfill wishes\nof their own, each choosing a path that\ndrew them from the nest. Henry wished to\nbe an artist, Thomas a novelist.\n　I found myself alone in this mansion, yet\nstill wishing for nothing but their\nhappiness.\n　However, as the two began their\njourneys down their respective paths, my\nwish was completely and utterly crushed\nby upheavals of the time.
AC1_5_Scenario_00029	　The world was cast into war, and the\ntwo were sent to its bitter battlefield.\n　To add insult to injury, this was also\nwhen the gold mine withered to nothing,\nno longer able to support even me alone.\n　Powerless, I prayed for the war to end,\nand for the safe return of my beloved\nHenry and Thomas.\n　When news of the war's end finally came\nand the boys returned to me, they were\ndifferent... My two birds had been hurt. It\nwas as if their wings had been clipped.\n　Henry had lost his right arm, so could no\nlonger hold a paintbrush. And Thomas had\nlost his heart, and with it, his ability to\ntrust.\n　I held the tired, wounded pair in my arms\nand I cried. I was reminded of 32 years\nprior, when I held them for the first time.\n　I prayed that the scars on their bodies\nand hearts might heal as soon as possible.\n　But now...\n　I wonder if my actions from that point\non were right.\n　I once again find myself navigating\nsorrow and regret, just as I did when\nLeonard passed.\n　Only now there are no innocent faces\nto be found. No birds to ease these\nfeelings.
AC1_5_Scenario_00030	This is Lawrence's journal.
AC1_5_Scenario_00031	Great-grandfather...
AC1_5_Scenario_00032	There's something stuck between\nthe pages...
AC1_5_Scenario_00033	Is this a letter?
AC1_5_Scenario_00035	A letter... Was it sent here from\nsomeone?
AC1_5_Scenario_00098	Upon my death, Henry Edward is\nto inherit the entirety of my\nestate.\n - Lawrence Edward
AC1_5_Scenario_00037	This is Lawrence's will.
AC1_5_Scenario_00038	He even signed it. See?
AC1_5_Scenario_00084	My great-grandfather's will?
AC1_5_Scenario_00085	Yeah...
AC1_5_Scenario_00086	It says that the heir to his\ninheritance...is Henry.
AC1_5_Scenario_00087	...
AC1_5_Scenario_00101	So that means the will we found\nin the Silver Bird Room...
AC1_5_Scenario_00102	My father must have written\nthat himself.
AC1_5_Scenario_00103	*gasp*
AC1_5_Scenario_00039	Lawrence's journal and will are together.
AC1_5_Scenario_00040	Read the letter and journal again?
AC1_5_Scenario_00081	And then there's the will...
AC1_5_Scenario_00047	There's a small cabinet by the bed.
AC1_5_Scenario_00088	Wells told me...
AC1_5_Scenario_00089	that there's something great-\ngrandfather cherished in this\ndrawer.
AC1_5_Scenario_00048	Oh wow, you were right. There's\nsomething in there.
AC1_5_Scenario_00100	To my beloved father,\n\n　I ask that you find it in yourself to\nforgive me for turning my back on the\nlife you had hoped for me in choosing\nthe life of a musician.\n　I left home without so much as a word\nto you, and was confronted with the\ncruelties of the world. However, I'm\nhappy that I chose this path for myself.\n　I married, and became the father of\ntwo children. And now I hope there will\nbe a day when I can return home and\nspeak with you.\n\n　 - Leonard Edward
AC1_5_Scenario_00050	It's a letter from Lawrence's son.\nLooks like he left home.
AC1_5_Scenario_00090	Then the two children Leonard\nmentions here must be...
AC1_5_Scenario_00051	Uncle Henry and my father.
AC1_5_Scenario_00091	There's a letter from Leonard.
AC1_5_Scenario_00092	Read the letter again?
AC1_5_Scenario_00059	There's an old typewriter on the table.
AC1_5_Scenario_00093	There's a pile of old documents in the corner of\nthe room.
AC1_5_Scenario_00094	"Sales contract..." Were these\nused when selling gold?
AC1_5_Scenario_00068	Documents are stacked in the corner of\nthe room.
AC1_5_Scenario_00070	The metal door is closed.
AC1_5_Scenario_00071	Is this an automatic door? I\nwonder how we can open it.
AC1_5_Scenario_00073	The metal door is closed.
AC1_5_Scenario_00095	This is a picture of Mom, Dad,\nJessica, and...who's this?
AC1_5_Scenario_00096	There's a picture of Jessica, Richard,\nand Sayoko.
AC1_5_Scenario_00097	The person I thought was\nDad...was actually Bill?
AC1_5_00345	Jessica!
AC1_5_00359	Ugh...
AC1_5_00360	Ashley...
AC1_5_00361	Are you OK?
AC1_5_00362	I think so.
AC1_5_00363	But I'm dizzy. Everything is\nfoggy.
AC1_5_00364	I'm so sorry I let you go alone.
AC1_5_00365	It was selfish.
AC1_5_00366	This is all my fault.
AC1_5_00367	Are you hurt?
AC1_5_00368	No, I'm OK. I'm so glad\nyou're safe.
AC1_5_00369	Ugh...
AC1_5_00373	Handcuffs?
AC1_5_00375	No good...
AC1_5_00378	Thanks.
AC1_5_00376	I found them outside. I was so\nworried about you.
AC1_5_00379	Everything suddenly went dark...\nI must have been knocked out.
AC1_5_00380	When I came to, I was handcuffed\nto this beam.
AC1_5_00381	That's horrible!
AC1_5_00382	Who would do something\nlike that?
AC1_5_00383	<color=#00994CFF>Bill</color>...
AC1_5_00031	Bill did this?
AC1_5_00032	You know about him?
AC1_5_00033	Dad told me.
AC1_5_00034	You met your <color=#00994CFF>father</color>?
AC1_5_00036	Yeah.
AC1_5_00037	He told me a little.
AC1_5_00038	He was my assistant and is\nabsolutely brilliant. But he\nbetrayed me.
AC1_5_00039	He tried to steal the research\nwe did on this island.
AC1_5_00040	Bill tried to steal <color=#00994CFF>ANOTHER</color>?
AC1_5_00042	You knew Bill too?
AC1_5_00043	I did. 
AC1_5_00044	He used to work with Richard.
AC1_5_00045	I never expected him to turn\nup here.
AC1_5_00046	I ran into him right after I\nleft you.
AC1_5_00047	He said that he'd take me\nto Richard.
AC1_5_00048	I shouldn't have trusted him.
AC1_5_00049	He knocked me out somehow\nonce we got to the mansion.
AC1_5_00050	I had no idea.
AC1_5_00051	But wait...
AC1_5_00052	Dad said he caught Bill. 
AC1_5_00054	Regardless, I'm so glad you finally\nmet Richard.
AC1_5_00055	Yeah, I found him. 
AC1_5_00056	I asked him about ANOTHER.\nAnd about <color=#00994CFF>Mom</color>.
AC1_5_00058	He told you what happened?
AC1_5_00059	Yeah. We talked about it.
AC1_5_00062	So that's my dad, huh?
AC1_5_00063	What do you mean? Where is he?
AC1_5_00064	I was with him earlier...
AC1_5_00065	But he went off to do\nsomething else.
AC1_5_00066	Do something else? He left\nyou alone?
AC1_5_00067	Yeah. He said he had to go\nstart ANOTHER.
AC1_5_00068	Jessica. About Dad. He...
AC1_5_00069	He definitely cares way more\nabout his research than us.
AC1_5_00070	That's not—
AC1_5_00071	He said so.
AC1_5_00072	He told me he has to finish\nANOTHER. For Mom.
AC1_5_00073	Richard said that? Really?
AC1_5_00074	Yeah.
AC1_5_00077	Did you know about ANOTHER?
AC1_5_00078	Not really. Your father\nmentioned it a few times.
AC1_5_00079	Something about using it to save\npeople from painful memories.
AC1_5_00080	Yeah. He told me that too.
AC1_5_00081	He said Bill stole the keys\nhe needs to start it.
AC1_5_00082	So we split up. I went looking for\nthe keys while he looked for you.
AC1_5_00083	But he clearly didn't find you.
AC1_5_00084	Ashley...
AC1_5_00087	I found a newspaper article\nabout what happened to Mom.
AC1_5_00088	It said...
AC1_5_00089	It said Dad was <color=#00994CFF>a suspect</color>.
AC1_5_00091	I...
AC1_5_00092	You know the dream I\nalways have?
AC1_5_00093	It's about the night Mom\nwas murdered.
AC1_5_00094	Oh, Ashley...
AC1_5_00095	That's why, isn't it?
AC1_5_00096	That's why you never talked\nabout Mom or ANOTHER.
AC1_5_00097	You're right.
AC1_5_00110	Why was Dad a suspect?
AC1_5_00111	Listen to me.
AC1_5_00112	Richard found Sayoko that night.
AC1_5_00113	And because he was at the scene\nof the crime, he was a suspect.
AC1_5_00114	Right.
AC1_5_00115	He kept telling them he's\ninnocent. And with no other\nevidence, they released him.
AC1_5_00116	They couldn't find another lead,\nso the case went unsolved.
AC1_5_00117	The false accusations\ndevastated Richard.
AC1_5_00118	I confronted him as soon as he\nwas released from custody.
AC1_5_00119	I asked outright if he\nkilled Sayoko.
AC1_5_00120	He looked me right in the eyes...
AC1_5_00121	And answered without a hint\nof guilt.
AC1_5_00122	He said, "Absolutely not." 
AC1_5_00123	Mhm...
AC1_5_00124	He told me that too. That he\ndidn't kill her.
AC1_5_00125	But...
AC1_5_00126	What is it?
AC1_5_00127	He didn't look me in the eyes.
AC1_5_00128	It's hard to trust someone who\nacts like that.
AC1_5_00129	Oh, sweetheart.
AC1_5_00385	I'm just over all this. He isn't\nmy dad.
AC1_5_00386	Can't we both just leave here?\nTogether?
AC1_5_00387	I'll get those cuffs off you as\nsoon as I can.
AC1_5_00388	There's gotta be something I\ncan use around here.
AC1_5_00389	Ashley, wait.
AC1_5_00390	Please. Give Richard one\nmore chance.
AC1_5_00391	He can help.
AC1_5_00392	Why should I?
AC1_5_00393	At the very least, he can get me\nout of these handcuffs.
AC1_5_00394	But what about you?
AC1_5_00395	I can't leave you here. I just\nfound you!
AC1_5_00396	I'll be fine.
AC1_5_00397	Now go.
AC1_5_00398	N-no, I don't trust—
AC1_5_00400	I do.
AC1_5_00401	Please, Ashley. Believe in him.
AC1_5_00402	He's my older brother. And your\nfather. OK?
AC1_5_00403	But, I... OK.
AC1_5_00405	Once we get out of here, we'll go\nhome. The three of us.
AC1_5_00406	Yeah...
AC1_5_00408	You'll be safe here, right?
AC1_5_00409	I'll be right back with Dad.
AC1_5_00410	Yes. I'll be fine.
AC1_5_00414	Sayoko, protect her...
AC1_5_00415	Please.
AC1_5_00173	I'm so glad you found Jessica.
AC1_5_00174	Me too. But I don't think she\ncould see you...
AC1_5_00175	She's an adult. I'm used to it\nby now.
AC1_5_00176	I guess...
AC1_5_00177	More importantly, we can't let\nour guard down.
AC1_5_00178	You're right.
AC1_5_00179	I can't believe Bill did that\nto Jessica.
AC1_5_00180	But I'll worry about it later.\nWe need to find my dad.
AC1_5_00181	Where could he have gone?
AC1_5_00182	I think he was heading toward\nthe courtyard.
AC1_5_00418	No good. It's locked.
AC1_5_00419	Ashley, look. There's a ladder on\nthe other side of the door.
AC1_5_00421	You're right.
AC1_5_00422	Where do you think it leads?
AC1_5_00427	That's the door to my great-\ngrandfather's room.
AC1_5_00185	The door's locked.
AC1_5_00187	How can we open it?
AC1_5_00189	This design...
AC1_5_00190	The other rooms' doors had one\nbird but this one has two.
AC1_5_00191	Yeah... Two birds holding a silver\nand gold clover in their beaks.
AC1_5_00429	Maybe the key to this room is...
AC1_5_00194	The door's locked.
AC1_5_00195	Two birds holding a gold and silver four-leaf\nclover adorn the door.
AC1_5_00196	Maybe the key to this room is...
AC1_5_00430	Whoa, check out the view.
AC1_5_00431	Where's the ladder? Shouldn't it\nlead to this room?
AC1_5_00211	You can see the ocean from the window.
AC1_5_00212	Look! You can see the cove!
AC1_5_00213	Grandfather and I watched this\nview together... It hasn't\nchanged one bit.
AC1_5_00436	What's wrong, D?
AC1_5_00439	This is my great-grandfather,\nUncle Henry, and my father.
AC1_5_00440	Grandfather... Do you know who\nI am?
AC1_5_00444	I remember...
AC1_5_00445	My father brought me here.
AC1_5_00446	My great-grandfather was\nasleep in the bed.
AC1_5_00447	He was sleeping so peacefully...
AC1_5_00448	But as we got closer, he opened\nhis eyes and looked at us.
AC1_5_00449	He smiled, but it was sad.
AC1_5_00450	Father took his hand and\nsqueezed it. He was crying.
AC1_5_00451	That was the first time I ever\nsaw him cry.
AC1_5_00452	Oh, D...
AC1_5_00453	We have to track down your dad.
AC1_5_00454	Yeah...
AC1_5_00455	Where's the ladder we can take\nback down?
AC1_5_00240	Where are we?
AC1_5_00243	Did Dad really come\nthrough here?
AC1_5_00245	It's so dark. I can't even tell what\nthis room is supposed to be.
AC1_5_00247	We can't search it until we turn\nthe lights on.
AC1_5_00251	What was that?
AC1_5_00252	Oh!
AC1_5_00253	Look!
AC1_5_00255	The floor opened up!
AC1_5_00495	*gasp*
AC1_5_00496	...
AC1_5_00497	D? You OK?
AC1_5_00498	I've...been here before...
AC1_5_00499	Does that mean you know what's\npast here?
AC1_5_00500	I can't remember...
AC1_5_00510	Huh. A round light appeared on\nthe brick when the candle was lit.
AC1_5_00511	Oh, you're right.
AC1_5_00512	It must be coming from a\nlamp, but...
AC1_5_00513	Where's it coming from to make\nit so round?
AC1_5_00514	Check the shade.
AC1_5_00515	It looks like someone made this\nhole on purpose.
AC1_5_00516	Hm, yeah...
AC1_5_00265	Did Dad go down these steps?
AC1_5_00266	This place gives me the creeps.
AC1_5_00267	It's OK, I'm right here with you.
AC1_5_00268	Right, got it... Thanks, D.
AC1_5_00458	This must be Dad's lab.
AC1_5_00460	But where's Dad?
AC1_5_00462	Ashley, what is all this?
AC1_5_00463	I don't know... My dad's stuff,\nI guess.
AC1_5_00464	Grr...
AC1_5_00465	What's the matter?
AC1_5_00466	I'm just...getting so frustrated.\nWhere's Dad already?
AC1_5_00467	We looked all over the place!
AC1_5_00468	Whatever, forget it. Let's just\nfind something to get those\ncuffs off Jessica ourselves.
AC1_5_00469	And then the two of us will get\noff this island.
AC1_5_00471	What?
AC1_5_00472	What did you say?
AC1_5_00473	Um... When?
AC1_5_00474	Just now. You said you're going\nto leave without even seeing\nyour dad again?
AC1_5_00475	Well, I just... I mean, he...
AC1_5_00476	You told Jessica you'd find him.
AC1_5_00477	That you'd give him a chance.
AC1_5_00478	It's not that easy, D.\nI'm... I'm scared.
AC1_5_00479	I'm scared to meet him, to talk to\nhim about Mom...
AC1_5_00480	It'll be OK.
AC1_5_00481	Even though facing the truth\ncan be hard, in the end, it's\nalways for the best.
AC1_5_00483	Dad?! Dad! Can you hear me?!
AC1_5_00486	Ugh...
AC1_5_00491	What was that?
AC1_5_00492	It came from the other side of\nthe door.
AC1_5_00493	Is someone in there?
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00001	The water's so dirty. It must have\nbeen a long time since it flowed.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00002	I can't look for the key with it\nlike this.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00285	I wonder if there's any way to\nclear the water up...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00286	I should check a little more\naround the fountain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00003	The water in the fountain is dirty.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00255	I've gotta find a way to clear up\nthis water...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00004	Maybe it'll clear up and I can find\nthe key if I get it flowing again.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00006	The water in the fountain is dirty.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00257	The key is pretty small, right?\nWhere could it be?
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00020	I can see symbols drawn on the\nbottom now that the water's\nclean.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00022	Star-sign symbols are inlaid\ninto the fountain's basin.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00023	An old water-pressure gauge... \nDoes it still work?
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00024	There's an old water-pressure gauge\ninstalled next to the fountain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00025	Oh! Is this the water-pressure\ngauge for the fountain?
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00300	The number on the meter...looks\nlike it's at 0.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00301	Does this handle move?
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00302	If I was able to do something with\nthis, it might make water come\nout of the fountain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00303	First, I should get a good look\nat it.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00259	Hmm. The color changes after it\nhits 0.7.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00026	Maybe there's no water coming\nout of the fountain because the\nmeter is at 0.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00304	The water-pressure gauge is pointing to 0.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00028	Maybe turning this handle will\nstart the water flow.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00029	Nope. Not a drop.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00030	I wonder what the water\npressure is like.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00311	Nothing's coming out right now.\nI need to find a way to get water\nout of it.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00048	The meter moved to 0.1!
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00049	Water must be flowing to\nthis pipe.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00305	The needle on the water-pressure gauge\nis pointing to 0.1.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00306	The needle on the meter moved\nwhen the water stopped!
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00307	Maybe water will come out of the\nfountain if I raise the water\npressure more.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00308	Alright! I should stop the other\nsprinklers too!
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00309	I should stop the other\nsprinklers!
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00050	I wonder if water will come out\nof the fountain now...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00051	No water... Maybe it's because\nthe sprinklers are still on?
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00312	Now even if I turn this, water\nwon't come out of the fountain...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00313	The meter has moved up, so\nwater might come out of the\nfountain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00314	No good...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00315	The meter has moved up, so\nwater might come out of the\nfountain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00316	No good...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00317	The needle has moved a bunch,\nso maybe...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00318	Nope...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00319	The needle has moved a bunch,\nso maybe...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00320	Nope...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00321	Alright, this must be enough\nto get the water to come out...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00322	What?! Still not enough?
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00323	Looks like the water won't come\nout with the gauge at this value.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00074	The needle moved to a different\ncolored area. So if I turn the\nhandle right now...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00310	The needle moved down... I've\ngotta stop the sprinklers...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00081	Water's all clean. Time to find\nthat key.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00082	There's a handle that controls the fountain\nnext to a water-pressure gauge.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00260	There's an old valve.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00085	I bet this is the main valve.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00261	I should take a closer look at this.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00262	There's an old valve. There's no water flowing.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00088	OK, let's give it a turn!
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00264	Water's coming out!
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00265	But nothing from the fountain...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00094	I'll check out some other spots\nnow that the water's flowing.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00095	The old valve is open.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00096	There's an old pipe and handle.\nThe valve is open.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00097	What the heck is this?
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00098	It has a lever, so it must do\nsomething...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00099	There's a pipe with a lever attached.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00100	I bet I can use this.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00288	Let's give it a shot.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00101	I'll move it.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00102	The sprinklers have stopped.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00289	I should stop the sprinklers\nagain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00290	Alright, I stopped them.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00104	The sprinklers started working\nagain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00105	I wonder what this changed.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00291	The sprinklers started working\nagain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00106	There's a device that changes the flow of\nwater.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00111	Guess I'll find out.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00112	The sprinklers stopped...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00292	I should stop the sprinklers\nagain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00293	Alright, they stopped.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00114	The sprinklers started working\nagain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00115	I wonder what this changed.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00294	The sprinklers started working\nagain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00126	Let's try the lever.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00127	The sprinklers stopped...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00295	I should stop the sprinklers\nagain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00296	Alright, they stopped.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00129	Let's move the lever.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00130	The sprinklers started working\nagain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00131	I wonder what changed.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00297	The sprinklers started working\nagain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00141	I wonder if this sprinkler is for\nwatering flowers.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00142	There's a sprinkler.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00143	I wonder if I should stop the\nsprinklers.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00144	There's a sprinkler.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00145	There's a sprinkler.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00153	There's no water coming out of the sprinkler.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00195	There's a handle on\nthis sprinkler.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00299	There's a sprinkler with a handle.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00197	Let's try turning it.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00268	Hmm, the water stopped...
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00298	This has a handle too. I should\ncheck it out.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00237	Wow, what a great view of the\nyard. It looks nice with the\nfountain being clean.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00238	Look, there's something under\nthe water.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00239	Those look like the symbols for\nthe star signs.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00244	I'm glad I was able to clear the\nwater up.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00269	It made it way easier to see the\nsymbols beneath it.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00246	Wow, what a great view of the\nyard. It looks nice with the\nfountain being clean.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00247	Look, there's something under\nthe water.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00248	Those look like the symbols for\nthe star signs.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00253	From here I can see two bird\nstatues built into the fountain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00270	It's almost like they're looking\nat the star signs.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00254	There's a large fountain in the courtyard.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00273	That's a hummingbird.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00274	There's a golden bird at the edge of\nthe fountain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00275	No way this is just a decorative\nbird, right?
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00276	There must be some meaning\nto it.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00277	There's a golden bird at the edge of\nthe fountain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00278	I wonder if it's just a decoration.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00279	That's a hummingbird.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00280	There's a silver bird in the center of\nthe fountain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00281	There's another bird here.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00282	It must mean something.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00283	There's a silver bird in the center of\nthe fountain.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00284	I wonder if it's just a decoration.
AC1_Mystery_5_1_00324	I should be looking for the key\nright now.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00476	This is...
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00475	It's the same as that device\non the desk in my great-\ngrandfather's room, right?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00474	Do you think they're related?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00462	Hold on, is this a trapdoor?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00001	That ladder we saw before must\nbe under it.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00002	Uggh!
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00004	Ugh, it won't budge with that\ndesk in the way.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00005	What can I do...
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00461	There's an elegant desk.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00069	A large desk sits atop the door in the floor.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00071	How can I move the desk?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00076	This should do it!
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00463	Yeah! It's open!
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00077	There's the ladder!
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00078	Let's take it down.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00079	Dad has gotta be just past here.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00473	It won't open.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00464	What's this rail?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00215	Oh, there's something...weird\nbuilt into the drawer.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00219	Try moving it.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00465	There's a mysterious disk in the drawer.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00466	What could this be?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00221	There's a mysterious disk in the drawer.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00467	What could this be?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00468	Looks like this is how the\npictures on the disk are\nsupposed to be lined up.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00469	I think I can rotate this.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00470	Try moving it.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00222	How's this?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00224	Oh, so it was some sort of\nmechanism.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00225	We should be able to open the\ndoor now.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00227	What should I do?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00228	But I'm sure there's some sort of\nmechanism to this.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00229	What do we need to do?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00230	Haven't we seen this disk symbol\nsomewhere else?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00234	There's a mysterious disk in the drawer.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00270	What should I do?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00271	Star signs and birds...\nWhere have we seen that?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00303	A round device made of tin sits on the table.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00304	What's this? Some kind of stand?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00305	That's a zoetrope.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00308	A zoe-whatsit?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00309	They were invented a long time\nago. Long before I was born.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00310	The pictures inside move when\nit spins.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00311	How does it work?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00312	Spin the outside with your hand\nand look in through the slits on\nthe side.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00477	I'll give it a try.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00316	There's a zoetrope on the table.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00478	Wow, that's pretty cool. It really\nlooked like it was moving.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00313	Moving pictures are so much fun.\nI used to love this thing.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00314	I guess inventions like this led\nto the creation of movies.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00315	Really? Wow. I had no idea!
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00471	How do you know all this stuff?\nIt's great!
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00472	Well... I always wanted to be\na filmmaker when I grew up.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00479	That was my dream...
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00480	Oh... Sorry, D...
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00395	Is this a screen?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00396	Yeah. My great-grandfather\nwould watch this in bed.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00397	He had such a nostalgic look on\nhis face when he did...
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00398	I wonder what he'd watch.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00403	There's a large, dusty screen near the wall.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00413	There's a projector on the side table.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00414	This is a movie projector, right?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00481	What sort of movies could your\ngreat-grandfather even watch\non this thing?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00482	Huh?!
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00483	Wow...
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00415	I just remembered something.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00416	After my great-grandfather\ndied, my father showed me\nsomething with this.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00417	Huh?
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00418	It was...some old footage.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00419	It was shots of my father and\nUncle Henry playing together\nas kids.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00420	The two of them, together...
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00421	It seemed like it made him sad\nfor some reason.
AC1_Mystery_5_3,4,5_00422	I get that.
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00053	The lamp is lit up red.
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00054	What's this?
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00055	It looks like the lamp's cord is\nconnected to the floor below.
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00056	The lamp is lit up red.
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00057	The lamp on the pillar changed to green.
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00006	The door is closed and won't open.
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00007	The floor is illuminated by the light of an\nold candlestick.
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00008	The wall is illuminated by the light of an\nold candlestick.
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00009	The wall is illuminated by the light of an\nold candlestick.
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00010	The surroundings are illuminated by the light\nof an old candlestick.
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00023	If you look closely, this brick's a\nlittle different than the rest.
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00024	No way, really?
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00064	We should check it out.
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00065	Yeah.
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00066	It moved when I touched it!
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00067	The light from the candlestick illuminates a\nhidden switch that opened the secret stairs.
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00068	The surroundings are illuminated by the light\nof an old candlestick.
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00047	One of the walls is covered in old newspapers.
AC1_Mystery_5_6_00069	These are all articles about the\ngold mine.
AC1_6_Scenario_00092	This isn't the time to head back\nto the mansion.
AC1_6_Scenario_00090	Did Bill disconnect the power\nfrom here?
AC1_6_Scenario_00097	This is Dad's room, so I should\njust wait here... Right?
AC1_6_Scenario_00096	I wonder if he's all right... But he\ntold me to wait here, so I guess\nI will.
AC1_6_Scenario_00071	There's a document icon on the monitor.
AC1_6_Scenario_00072	So this is Dad's journal?
AC1_6_Scenario_00073	Read Richard's journal again?
AC1_6_Scenario_00019	There's a document icon on the monitor.
AC1_6_Scenario_00020	Date:\n\nSayoko,\nAt last, our ANOTHER is complete after 11\nyears.\n\nRight now I'm remembering your words,\nSayoko: \n"If the memories that cause suffering\nwere to disappear..."\n\nYour guiding principle was to use our\nmemory-controlling technology to\nalleviate suffering.\n\nAnd that's why I'm sure you'd forgive me,\nSayoko...for using ANOTHER to erase\nAshley's memories of what happened\nthat night.
AC1_6_Scenario_00021	Date:\n\nI sent a letter and the DAS to Ashley. I\npray from the bottom of my heart that\nshe'll come to this island.\n\nI need to speak with Bill one more time\nbefore I'm reunited with her. I'm certain\nBill will understand what Sayoko and I\ndesired for ANOTHER.
AC1_6_Scenario_00022	This is Dad's diary.
AC1_6_Scenario_00033	There's a picture frame on the desk.
AC1_6_Scenario_00034	It's a picture of Richard, Sayoko, and a baby.
AC1_6_Scenario_00035	These are my parents. So this\nbaby must be...
AC1_6_Scenario_00036	It's you, right?
AC1_6_Scenario_00037	Your dad must have looked at\nthis picture all the time.
AC1_6_Scenario_00038	Guess so...
AC1_6_Scenario_00039	There are a few pages clipped together.
AC1_6_Scenario_00040	It's Dad's thesis. "Research into\nANOTHER... Revised Edition?"
AC1_6_Scenario_00041	Research into ANOTHER - Revised\nEdition\nRichard Robins\n\nAdding addenda below regarding the\nmemory-control experiments that are now\npossible with the completion of the device\nimplementing the ANOTHER theory.\n\n1. Memory Extraction\nThe experiment to extract a test subject's\nmemory data and temporarily store it\nwithin ANOTHER was successful.\n\n2. Memory Replacement\nThe experiment of temporarily losing\nmemories that are already present and\noverwriting them with different memories\nwas successful. However, the use of this\nfeature sometimes results in the subject\nsuffering painful headaches, as well as\nhallucinations due to the muddying of\ntheir memories.\n\n3. Memory Restoration\nCurrently implementing the feature to\nrestore memories that have been\ntemporarily lost back to their original\nstate with a focus on safety.
AC1_6_Scenario_00042	OK, so I know all of these words...\nBut this makes no sense to me.
AC1_6_Scenario_00045	There's a revised version of the thesis.
AC1_6_Scenario_00046	Read the thesis again?
AC1_6_Scenario_00050	Hm, nope. Still don't get it. And\nnow it's giving me a headache.
AC1_6_Scenario_00093	This door isn't responding.
AC1_6_Scenario_00094	So he used this to open\nthe door?
AC1_6_Scenario_00098	Dad still isn't back... And the\nlonger he's gone, the more\nworried I get.
AC1_6_Scenario_00099	I can't just wait around any\nlonger. I've gotta find him.
AC1_6_Scenario_00074	Ugh...
AC1_6_Scenario_00075	Just wait, Dad... You'll feel better\nsoon, I promise.
AC1_6_Scenario_00077	How do I use it?
AC1_6_Scenario_00078	It's...you, Ashley... You're the key.
AC1_6_Scenario_00081	What should I do?
AC1_6_Scenario_00082	Use...the DAS...
AC1_6_Scenario_00083	User recognized as Ashley\nMizuki Robins.
AC1_6_Scenario_00084	Biometric data accepted.\nAdditional feature now\navailable for use.
AC1_6_Scenario_00086	It worked! I unlocked the new\nfeature!
AC1_6_Scenario_00087	Something tells me I shouldn't\npress this one...
AC1_6_Scenario_00088	The new feature can show me\nDad's real memories.
AC1_6_Scenario_00089	The ANOTHER control panel doesn't respond.
AC1_6_Scenario_00091	How do I add new features?
AC1_6_Scenario_00054	I've gotta find Bill...
AC1_6_Scenario_00055	I need to use ANOTHER...
AC1_6_Scenario_00056	I'm going to save my dad.
AC1_6_00007	That voice...
AC1_6_00010	Someone's in there...
AC1_6_00013	Hello? Are you there?
AC1_6_00015	Please. Answer me.
AC1_6_00017	If I could just...hear your voice...
AC1_6_00018	...
AC1_6_00020	Are you... Are you my...
AC1_6_00021	Ashley? Is it you?
AC1_6_00024	Say something!
AC1_6_00025	Who is that? Who are you?
AC1_6_00027	How do you know my name?
AC1_6_00029	It is you! I knew it!
AC1_6_00030	Ashley, it really is you...
AC1_6_00032	I asked you a question!\nWho are you?!
AC1_6_00033	My name is...
AC1_6_00034	Richard.
AC1_6_00927	I'm Richard Robins.
AC1_6_00036	I'm your father.
AC1_6_00037	I've missed you so much...
AC1_6_00109	Please... I just want to hear your\nvoice again.
AC1_6_00110	...
AC1_6_00111	What are you thinking?
AC1_6_00112	I just need to figure out what's\nreally going on.
AC1_6_00113	So I'm gonna open this door.
AC1_6_00933	There's a metal door.
AC1_6_00934	I don't see a way to open it...
AC1_6_00935	Nope. No good.
AC1_6_00937	Hey, why won't this door open?
AC1_6_00938	Oh, um...
AC1_6_00941	It's an automatic door.
AC1_6_00942	I had figured that much out,\nbut thanks.
AC1_6_00943	I can't figure out how to open it.\nIs it locked?
AC1_6_00944	Not exactly...
AC1_6_00945	What do you mean?
AC1_6_00946	The door isn't receiving\nany power.
AC1_6_00948	Hmm...
AC1_6_00949	I'm telling you the truth. It can't\nopen like this.
AC1_6_00950	Um...
AC1_6_00951	Ashley, please trust me.
AC1_6_00953	...
AC1_6_00954	I'll explain once we get the\ndoor open.
AC1_6_00955	We need to restore—
AC1_6_00956	OK, fine. I get it. You need me to\nrestore power to the door.
AC1_6_00957	So you'll do it?
AC1_6_00958	I'll at least give it a try.
AC1_6_00959	Thank you, Ashley.
AC1_6_00962	Where's the power come from?
AC1_6_00963	There's a switchboard box on\nthe wall near the door.
AC1_6_00964	Open that and flip the switches.
AC1_6_00967	You'll need a screwdriver to\nopen the panel cover.
AC1_6_00968	A screwdriver?
AC1_6_00969	Yes, a Phillips head.
AC1_6_00970	Phillips-head screwdriver... Got\nit. I'll look around for one.
AC1_6_00973	Um, question...
AC1_6_00974	What's that?
AC1_6_00975	Where can I find a Phillips-head\nscrewdriver?
AC1_6_00976	Let's see...
AC1_6_00977	There should be one in the desk\ndrawer. Or, uh... Actually, just\nlook on top of the desk.
AC1_6_00978	OK, I'll check the desk.
AC1_6_00981	Have you found the\nscrewdriver?
AC1_6_00982	Not yet.
AC1_6_00983	Look carefully. There should be a\nblue screwdriver on the desk.
AC1_6_00986	Ummm...
AC1_6_00987	What is it?
AC1_6_00988	I found the screwdriver... It was\nin a cup.
AC1_6_00989	Oh, yeah... Right... I needed\nsomething to stir my drink,\nand it was right there, so...
AC1_6_00990	Just wipe it off. It'll work fine.
AC1_6_00991	Ugh, all right. I mean, kind of\ngross, but all right.
AC1_6_00994	Use the screwdriver to open the\ncover inside the switchboard.
AC1_6_00998	OK, so...
AC1_6_00999	Did you get it open?
AC1_6_01000	Yeah.
AC1_6_01001	Good, way to go.
AC1_6_01002	Now you've just got to figure out\nthe switches.
AC1_6_01003	Some of them may be locked.
AC1_6_01004	You'll need keys to release them.
AC1_6_01005	More keys?
AC1_6_01006	Yes, security keys.
AC1_6_01007	Like the orange one that was\nbehind the cover?
AC1_6_01008	Just one? The rest must have\nbeen moved...
AC1_6_01009	Well, that's a security key all\nright, but...
AC1_6_01010	You need two more. There are\nthree in total, and each one is a\ndifferent color.
AC1_6_01011	Got it. I'll look around for them.
AC1_6_01015	I don't have all three security\nkeys yet.
AC1_6_01016	Do you remember where you last\nsaw them?
AC1_6_01017	Let me think...
AC1_6_01018	On the shelf with the glass door...
AC1_6_01019	and maybe near the blackboard?
AC1_6_01020	OK, I'll check there.
AC1_6_01023	I found all the security keys.
AC1_6_01024	Good job! I knew you would.
AC1_6_01025	Now put them into the control\npanel to unlock the switches.
AC1_6_01026	Got it.
AC1_6_01029	Just a bit more... Almost done.
AC1_6_01031	They're all connected!
AC1_6_01032	Now the power should be back!
AC1_6_01037	Hnghuh!
AC1_6_01043	Uh...
AC1_6_01045	You... You're...
AC1_6_01046	Ashley...
AC1_6_01047	You've grown so much...
AC1_6_01048	But your eyes...
AC1_6_01049	They're the same.
AC1_6_01051	They haven't changed a bit.\nThey're just as they were\n11 years ago.
AC1_6_01052	This is the man who would come\nto the graveyard once in a while.
AC1_6_01053	Huh?
AC1_6_01056	Then, who was...
AC1_6_01058	Ashley.
AC1_6_01382	(Exert Noise)
AC1_6_01065	Dad...
AC1_6_01383	(Exert Noise)
AC1_6_01380	(Exert Noise)
AC1_6_01069	I remember.
AC1_6_01070	You're my dad...
AC1_6_01071	The first time I've seen him in 11 years and all\nI can think is that he smells like chocolate.
AC1_6_01074	I'm glad I trusted Jessica\nand went looking for Dad.
AC1_6_01076	Jessica told me...
AC1_6_01077	She told me to believe\nin him. To hear him out.
AC1_6_01381	(Exert Noise)
AC1_6_01082	What do you hope to accomplish?!
AC1_6_01085	What's wrong?
AC1_6_01086	Hm... Um...
AC1_6_01087	Hey, uh... Dad... I met someone\nhere while looking for Jessica.
AC1_6_01088	Someone pretending to be you.\nHe told me he's my dad.
AC1_6_01089	Could that have been...
AC1_6_01090	Bill.
AC1_6_01091	Why would he pretend to be you?\nWhy would he lie about that?
AC1_6_01094	Come on, answer me.
AC1_6_01095	I'm sorry, Ashley...
AC1_6_01096	Sorry for what?
AC1_6_01097	You aren't...mad at me, are you?
AC1_6_01098	Are you mad because I believed\nthat Bill was you?
AC1_6_01099	Because I...helped him look for\nthe ANOTHER keys?
AC1_6_01101	Bill was after the keys?
AC1_6_01102	Yeah, he asked me to help him.
AC1_6_01103	I used the DAS to track them\nall down.
AC1_6_01105	Wait, Ashley... Did you—
AC1_6_01106	I...gave them to Bill.
AC1_6_01107	I solved this piano puzzle and\nfound a key.
AC1_6_01108	And then I ran into Bill, who told\nme he was you...
AC1_6_01109	I showed him the DAS and he...
AC1_6_01110	He had you look for the keys.
AC1_6_01111	Yeah...
AC1_6_01114	Do you know where he is\nright now?
AC1_6_01115	He said something about booting\nup ANOTHER, but...
AC1_6_01116	He has the keys and he's heading\nfor ANOTHER?!
AC1_6_01117	Bill... What's your plan?
AC1_6_01119	I've got to go after him.
AC1_6_01120	...
AC1_6_01121	Wait, where are you going?!
AC1_6_01122	Ashley, wait here... Please.
AC1_6_01125	I'll protect ANOTHER from Bill.
AC1_6_01126	Dad, wait! I'm coming with you.
AC1_6_00288	Ashley...
AC1_6_00289	Where are we going?
AC1_6_00290	You'll see. Come on.
AC1_6_01127	Is this...
AC1_6_01128	It's ANOTHER.
AC1_6_01131	What's that?
AC1_6_01132	It's ANOTHER's control panel.
AC1_6_01134	There are the keys.
AC1_6_01135	Bill's starting it up.
AC1_6_01137	So that's his plan...
AC1_6_01138	What's going on?
AC1_6_01377	The fruits of your research are\nrightfully mine, Richard.
AC1_6_01140	He's transferring ANOTHER's\ndata to someone.
AC1_6_01141	To who?
AC1_6_01142	My guess? To no one good. He's\nsending the source code.
AC1_6_01144	What can we do?
AC1_6_01145	We'll be OK. I built in some fail-\nsafes in case something like\nthis happened.
AC1_6_01148	It stopped!
AC1_6_01150	I guess that takes care of that.
AC1_6_01153	Now you've really gone and done\nit, Richard.
AC1_6_01154	Bill!
AC1_6_01155	Why, you...
AC1_6_01156	Your plan for ANOTHER is entirely\nantithetical to its true purpose.
AC1_6_01157	Heh. Antithetical, you say?
AC1_6_01158	Stop this foolishness.
AC1_6_01159	ANOTHER's memory control was\ndeveloped to help people.
AC1_6_01160	People with real trauma—people\nwho suffered in accidents or\nin war.
AC1_6_01161	You used to understand this...\nIt's why you helped create it\nin the first place.
AC1_6_01162	Oh, Richard...
AC1_6_01163	I am sick and tired of your "Saint\nRichard, holier than thou" act.
AC1_6_01164	Bill...
AC1_6_01165	You just don't grasp ANOTHER's\nfull potential.
AC1_6_01166	What do you mean?
AC1_6_01167	You've invented a revolution...\nThis machine rewrites memories!
AC1_6_01168	People the world over would pay\nhand over fist for such a thing!
AC1_6_01169	ANOTHER can make us both rich\nbeyond our wildest dreams.
AC1_6_01170	No!
AC1_6_01171	That's not what it's for!
AC1_6_01172	ANOTHER is the fruit of Sayoko's\nresearch... And you would reduce\nit to a cash grab?!
AC1_6_01173	So you know exactly how she\nintended ANOTHER to be used,\ndo you?
AC1_6_01174	What gives you the right to speak\non Sayoko's behalf?
AC1_6_01176	Ugh...
AC1_6_01177	Dad?
AC1_6_01178	My head... Ugh!
AC1_6_01179	Feels like it's...going to split!
AC1_6_01180	Something the matter?
AC1_6_01181	Bill... ANOTHER is... It's...
AC1_6_01182	My dad created ANOTHER. We're\nnot letting you have it!
AC1_6_01183	You're nothing but a liar!
AC1_6_01184	Everyone lies, Ashley. Even your\ndad here.
AC1_6_01185	Ugh...
AC1_6_01186	You haven't lied to me, have you?
AC1_6_01187	Ugh...
AC1_6_01188	What's the matter? Are you OK?
AC1_6_01189	Ashley, I...
AC1_6_01190	You're wrong! My dad wouldn't\nlie to me!
AC1_6_01191	He may have been gone most of\nmy life... But he's no liar!
AC1_6_01192	It's such a tragic tale, Richard,\ndon't you think?
AC1_6_01193	Ask your father, Ashley... Ask him\nwho killed your mother.
AC1_6_01194	Dad... Do you know who\nkilled mom?
AC1_6_01195	Ashley, that...
AC1_6_01196	Ugh!
AC1_6_01197	What's the matter?!
AC1_6_01198	He needs to lie down...
AC1_6_01200	Is this the side effect Richard\nwarned about?
AC1_6_01201	Heh. If so, it couldn't have come\nat a better time.
AC1_6_01202	Bill! What did you do to my dad?!\nYou need to help him!
AC1_6_01203	I could help him...
AC1_6_01204	But on one condition.
AC1_6_01205	What?
AC1_6_01206	Use ANOTHER on Richard.
AC1_6_01207	To do what?
AC1_6_01208	Memories are rushing to the\nsurface. It's overwhelming\nhis mind.
AC1_6_01209	You can stop his pain by taking\ncontrol of his memories.
AC1_6_01210	Oh... OK...
AC1_6_01217	Well done, Ashley.
AC1_6_01219	OK... I've set the DAS and started\nup ANOTHER.
AC1_6_01220	Access his memories from 1994.
AC1_6_01237	Sayoko!
AC1_6_01246	What?
AC1_6_01247	What we saw just now...a memory\nof Dad's from 1994...
AC1_6_01248	That's when...
AC1_6_01250	Ashley...
AC1_6_01251	That is the truth.
AC1_6_01252	...
AC1_6_01254	Hmhmhm...
AC1_6_01255	What's happening to my dad?
AC1_6_01256	You said you'd help him!
AC1_6_01257	He'll wake up soon. If he's lucky.
AC1_6_01258	That'll be all then.
AC1_6_01260	Wait!
AC1_6_01262	Dad...
AC1_6_01264	Dad?
AC1_6_01266	What happened?
AC1_6_01268	Ashley, tell me what happened.
AC1_6_01270	Bill said that if I wanted to\nhelp you...
AC1_6_01271	I needed to boot up ANOTHER.
AC1_6_01272	And that I needed to...
AC1_6_01273	To look at your memories of the\nnight Mom died.
AC1_6_01274	What?
AC1_6_01275	Did... Did you kill Mom?
AC1_6_01276	No, I—
AC1_6_01277	Ugh!
AC1_6_01278	Dad?!
AC1_6_01279	I would never hurt...Sayoko.\nIt simply...isn't possible.
AC1_6_01280	Dad...
AC1_6_01282	The data transfer has started.
AC1_6_01283	It looks like ANOTHER's security\nsystems were bypassed.
AC1_6_01284	Did he use ANOTHER to...
AC1_6_01286	Ashley, I need you to do\nsomething for me.
AC1_6_01287	Look at my memories again.
AC1_6_01288	I suspect that Bill has\naltered them.
AC1_6_01289	What?
AC1_6_01290	Use ANOTHER to play back my\ndeepest memories.
AC1_6_01291	You should be able to do that\nwith the DAS.
AC1_6_01292	OK... But how?
AC1_6_01293	I equipped ANOTHER with a few\nbonus features.
AC1_6_01294	They're accessible only by using\nthe DAS.
AC1_6_01295	I never told Bill about them.
AC1_6_01296	They were designed to protect\nANOTHER from those who would\nuse it for harm.
AC1_6_01297	These features and the DAS can\nprotect ANOTHER?
AC1_6_01298	That's right.
AC1_6_01299	And I only trusted one person\nto keep the DAS safe...
AC1_6_01300	You, Ashley. And you alone.
AC1_6_01301	Dad...
AC1_6_01304	Use that to play back my true\nmemories in ANOTHER.
AC1_6_01305	This is the truth... What really\nhappened the night Sayoko died.
AC1_6_01307	Ugh...
AC1_6_01331	I'm home!
AC1_6_00683	Dad?!
AC1_6_00688	Ugh...
AC1_6_00692	Dad! Are you OK?
AC1_6_00694	Yeah... I'm OK.
AC1_6_00696	I... When I...
AC1_6_00697	When I came home...your mom\nwas... She was already...
AC1_6_00698	I know, Dad. I saw it in ANOTHER.
AC1_6_01338	What really happened the night\nMom died.
AC1_6_01339	Mom was shot protecting me\nand ANOTHER.
AC1_6_01340	You came home to find her\nlike that...
AC1_6_01341	The last thing she said...as you\nheld her in your arms...
AC1_6_01342	was to keep me safe.
AC1_6_00699	It's OK now, Dad. We know the\ntruth! You didn't kill her.
AC1_6_01343	Ashley...
AC1_6_01344	Dad, it's OK... We're OK.
AC1_6_01345	My memories...
AC1_6_01346	They're back.
AC1_6_01347	I feel like I've finally...earned the\nright to hug you...
AC1_6_00701	Oh, Ashley...
AC1_6_00702	Dad...
AC1_6_00707	I'm so glad...
AC1_6_00708	So glad I trusted you like Jessica\nasked me to.
AC1_6_01350	But now...
AC1_6_01351	Bill has the research you and\nMom were trying to protect.
AC1_6_01352	What do we do? ANOTHER could\nwind up in anyone's hands.
AC1_6_01353	Ashley...
AC1_6_01355	Richard, please...
AC1_6_01356	Protect...the ANOTHER...
AC1_6_01358	Don't worry. I won't let ANOTHER\nfall into the wrong hands.
AC1_6_01359	Dad?
AC1_6_01360	Can I borrow the DAS?
AC1_6_01361	Oh, um... Sure.
AC1_6_01364	Bill won't get away with this.
AC1_6_01365	I'll keep ANOTHER safe.
AC1_6_01367	It's just as you said, Sayoko...
AC1_6_01369	I should have locked it away.
AC1_6_01372	That should do it... This is what\nyou wanted, right?
AC1_6_00844	What? What's happening?!
AC1_6_00846	Huh?
AC1_6_00848	Richard... What have you done?!
AC1_6_00853	What's happening?!
AC1_6_00856	I have a few tricks up my sleeve\ntoo, Bill.
AC1_6_00858	You destroyed ANOTHER?
AC1_6_00859	Yes.
AC1_6_00860	An emergency fail-safe.
AC1_6_00862	But...this was all we had left\nof Mom's work.
AC1_6_00863	It's for the best. What happened\nhere will never happen again.
AC1_6_00892	Dad?
AC1_6_00893	I'm going to handle this.
AC1_6_00894	You wait here.
AC1_6_00895	No! I want to go with you!
AC1_6_00896	I don't care how dangerous it is.\nI can't just wait here.
AC1_6_00897	Ashley...
AC1_6_00898	You're right. Let's go together.
AC1_6_00923	...
AC1_6_00904	D...
AC1_6_00908	Thanks.
AC1_6_00909	For what?
AC1_6_00910	If it weren't for you...
AC1_6_00911	I wouldn't have made it this far.
AC1_6_00912	And I definitely couldn't have saved Dad.
AC1_6_00913	So...thanks.
AC1_6_00914	Mhm.
AC1_6_00915	Once we talk to Bill and save Jessica...
AC1_6_00916	I'll help you get your memories back.
AC1_6_00917	I'll be right here by your side...
AC1_6_00918	until you've remembered everything.
AC1_6_00919	Thank you.
AC1_6_00924	...
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00104	There's a box attached to the wall.
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00105	Is this the switchboard?
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00106	I think so.
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00107	Where's the power coming from?
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00108	Maybe this?
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00109	Why don't you open it to check?
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00111	There's a cover on the inside...
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00147	It's attached with a screw. I won't\nbe able to open it yet, I guess.
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00112	Looks like all sorts of devices\nare connected.
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00113	I should be able to open it\nwith this.
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00114	Guess I don't have to use this.
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00148	The cover is locked on with a screw.
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00144	Is this the control panel? 
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00145	I don't want to mess anything up.\nI should ask that person for help.
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00115	I can use this control panel to\npower up the other panel.
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00138	Do I just need to press the switch\nand connect the lines?
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00116	Are these slots for the\nsecurity keys?
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00117	I can unlock it by using the\nkey here.
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00118	The wires changed when I\npressed the switch!
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00122	This row of switches is already\nunlocked.
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00123	The desk is cluttered with all sorts of things.
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00126	Was someone drinking this?
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00127	What is that in the cup?
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00130	It's, um... A screwdriver?!
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00131	Ugh... He couldn't find something\nelse to stir his coffee with?
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00146	There's nothing here.
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00139	All right! I got the cover open!
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00140	Look, there's something in it.
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00141	An object sits inside the cover.
AC1_Mystery_6_1_00142	What's this?
AC1_Mystery_6_3_00002	Aww! This teddy bear's so cute!
AC1_Mystery_6_3_00023	Oh, it has a card.
AC1_Mystery_6_3_00024	I bet it's a present for you from\nyour dad.
AC1_Mystery_6_3_00025	Hmm... Yeah.
AC1_Mystery_6_3_00022	An acrylic box containing a teddy bear is\nwrapped up with a ribbon.
AC1_Mystery_6_3_00018	Today's February 24th.
AC1_Mystery_6_3_00019	Oh, that reminds me... Tomorrow\nis my birthday.
AC1_Mystery_6_3_00020	What a crazy day.
AC1_7_Scenario_00117	D's shoe is on the ground.
AC1_7_Scenario_00129	D ran all the way here.
AC1_7_Scenario_00002	Bill
AC1_7_Scenario_00005	Lawrence
AC1_7_Scenario_00006	Richard
AC1_7_Scenario_00007	Henry
AC1_7_Scenario_00008	Jessica
AC1_7_Scenario_00009	Thomas
AC1_7_Scenario_00010	   He was Dad's research associate helping on\nthe development of ANOTHER on Blood Edward\nIsland. He tricked me by pretending to be Dad.
AC1_7_Scenario_00013	   The owner of Blood Edward Island and head of\nthe Edward family. His company was profitable\nenough to build a mansion within his lifetime, but\nhe remained lonely throughout his life.
AC1_7_Scenario_00014	   My father, who I was told died 11 years ago. \nHe has been secretly developing ANOTHER on\nthis island and sent me a letter to come here.
AC1_7_Scenario_00015	   Frannie's father, an artist who lost an arm in\nthe war. He shot his brother, Thomas.
AC1_7_Scenario_00016	   Dad's younger sister. She's been raising me for\nthe past 11 years, so she's like a mother to me.
AC1_7_Scenario_00105	No...
AC1_7_Scenario_00106	The person I saw that day from\ninside the closet was...
AC1_7_Scenario_00017	   D's father and a novelist. He came to this island\nwith D and was killed by his brother Henry.
AC1_7_Scenario_00019	The monitor reads "Transfer Complete."
AC1_7_Scenario_00020	"Transfer complete"? What did\nit transfer?
AC1_7_Scenario_00026	The monitor reads "Transfer Complete."
AC1_7_Scenario_00030	The monitor shows the broken ANOTHER.
AC1_7_Scenario_00031	Bill was watching from here.
AC1_7_Scenario_00035	Is someone on the other end?
AC1_7_Scenario_00036	j.c.valley_0013 joined the room.
AC1_7_Scenario_00039	j.c.valley_0013:\n   I got the data.
AC1_7_Scenario_00041	j.c.valley_0013:\n   ...
AC1_7_Scenario_00042	j.c.valley_0013:\n   Did something go wrong?
AC1_7_Scenario_00044	j.c.valley_0013:\n   ...
AC1_7_Scenario_00052	j.c.valley_0013 left the room.
AC1_7_Scenario_00053	They left the chat...
AC1_7_Scenario_00056	The chat room is empty.
AC1_7_Scenario_00118	Did that chime come from this?
AC1_7_Scenario_00079	I need to wait here for Jessica\nand Dad.
AC1_7_Scenario_00119	I wonder if Dad was able to use\nthat computer to figure out\nwhat's going on.
AC1_7_Scenario_00080	I can't go back right now.
AC1_7_Scenario_00081	I wonder if Dad was able to use\nthat computer to figure out\nwhat's going on.
AC1_7_Scenario_00082	I need to wait here for Jessica\nand Dad.
AC1_7_Scenario_00085	I think I scared off your friend.\nSorry 'bout that, miss.
AC1_7_Scenario_00086	You go have a chat with him. I'll\nwait for you here.
AC1_7_Scenario_00087	Finished your chat?
AC1_7_Scenario_00088	Yeah...
AC1_7_Scenario_00089	Well then, how about we\nshove off?
AC1_7_Scenario_00099	Once we're all back home...\nI think I'd like a family dinner.
AC1_7_Scenario_00104	Let's take it easy for a while.
AC1_7_Scenario_00121	When I woke up the next morning after\ngetting home from the island...
AC1_7_Scenario_00130	I found something great.
AC1_7_Scenario_00123	"Dear Ashley,\nHappy 14th birthday."
AC1_7_Scenario_00124	And on the bed, I found...
AC1_7_Scenario_00126	Two Memories
AC1_7_Scenario_00127	The End
AC1_7_00006	Hey, Dad?
AC1_7_00007	Hey, Ashley?
AC1_7_00008	Sorry. What were you going\nto say?
AC1_7_00009	No, no! You first.
AC1_7_00010	OK.
AC1_7_00011	You've been doing research here\nwith Bill for a while, right?
AC1_7_00012	Yes, I have.
AC1_7_00013	So are you...friends?
AC1_7_00014	We were once.
AC1_7_00015	Then how did things turn out\nlike this?
AC1_7_00016	It's a mystery to me too. That's\nwhy I want to find him.
AC1_7_00017	So I can ask him about all of this\nface-to-face.
AC1_7_00019	Oh.
AC1_7_00021	What were you about to say?
AC1_7_00022	I was just curious...
AC1_7_00023	Before we got into the elevator,\nI thought you said something.
AC1_7_00024	I was, um, just talking to myself.
AC1_7_00025	That's all it was, huh?
AC1_7_00125	It's so spooky.
AC1_7_00126	Watch your step.
AC1_7_00128	Bill should be up ahead.
AC1_7_01014	Hold on...
AC1_7_01015	I'll go first and check for him.
AC1_7_01016	Wait here, OK?
AC1_7_00132	D?
AC1_7_00134	I remember now.
AC1_7_00135	I've come this way before.
AC1_7_00136	Through this cave?
AC1_7_00137	Yes...
AC1_7_00138	I was running away, through the\ncourtyard out to the cave.
AC1_7_00139	Who were you running from?
AC1_7_00140	It was...
AC1_7_01334	*gasp*
AC1_7_01338	Thomas, why?! Why can't you understand?!
AC1_7_01340	I need that money... I'll do anything!
AC1_7_01341	For my son...
AC1_7_01343	If you won't give it over willingly, you leave\nme no other choice...
AC1_7_01344	Stop this, Thomas!
AC1_7_01349	Daniel... Wh-what did you see?
AC1_7_00142	Yes, that's right... I can see the\nperson chasing me...
AC1_7_00144	It was Uncle Henry.
AC1_7_00146	I saw my father in the Silver Bird\nRoom, covered in blood...
AC1_7_00147	I was scared...
AC1_7_00148	So very scared.
AC1_7_00156	So I kept going. That's when I\nlost my shoe.
AC1_7_01041	Bill.
AC1_7_01043	Thanks for all this, Richard.
AC1_7_01044	How could you destroy ANOTHER?\nIt took us 11 years to complete!
AC1_7_01045	What were you thinking?!
AC1_7_01046	What's your plan? Where did you\nsend the ANOTHER data?
AC1_7_01047	So you finally figured out that I\nwas trying to sell the data.
AC1_7_01048	When did it click?
AC1_7_01049	When I showed you the road map\nto its completion.
AC1_7_01050	You started acting differently\nafter you saw it.
AC1_7_01051	And so you took it upon yourself\nto meddle in my affairs.
AC1_7_01052	You hid the ANOTHER keys...
AC1_7_01053	You programmed a fail-safe\ninto the DAS and sent it to\nyour daughter...
AC1_7_01054	I wanted to trust you, Bill.
AC1_7_01055	I wanted to believe in you.
AC1_7_01056	I thought you understood\nSayoko's and my goals.
AC1_7_01057	Sayoko. Again?
AC1_7_01058	I am sick of you and your ideals.
AC1_7_01063	Ah!
AC1_7_01064	Was that a...
AC1_7_01071	That was your first and last\nwarning, Richard.
AC1_7_01072	I can't believe you would betray\nus for some quick cash.
AC1_7_01073	You partnered with us for\nall those years. Only to use\nANOTHER for your own selfish\npurposes.
AC1_7_01074	Hm.
AC1_7_01075	Tell me everything.
AC1_7_01076	Tell me the whole truth.
AC1_7_01077	You wouldn't understand.
AC1_7_01078	What I've been through... What I\nwanted... Sayoko...
AC1_7_01080	Dad!
AC1_7_01081	Stay back, Ashley!
AC1_7_01082	Oh, perfect timing.
AC1_7_01083	This will make things much\nmore interesting.
AC1_7_01085	Ahh!
AC1_7_01087	No!
AC1_7_01088	Stop!
AC1_7_01089	This is farewell, Ashley.
AC1_7_01090	What are you hoping to\naccomplish?!
AC1_7_01092	...
AC1_7_00329	I was hiding in the closet...\nI saw everything.
AC1_7_01314	（吐息演技）
AC1_7_01315	（吐息演技）
AC1_7_01098	I remember it all.
AC1_7_01099	That night...
AC1_7_01100	Mom's murder... It was you. Bill!
AC1_7_01102	Ha!
AC1_7_01103	I would never have guessed you'd\nremember with such clarity.
AC1_7_01104	So, it was you?
AC1_7_01105	It was.
AC1_7_01106	How could you?!
AC1_7_01107	Why did you murder Sayoko?!
AC1_7_01108	She was a traitor.
AC1_7_01109	What?
AC1_7_01110	A traitor to who?
AC1_7_01111	You really are clueless,\naren't you...
AC1_7_01112	Sayoko was working with us.
AC1_7_01113	Who is us?
AC1_7_01114	From the very start, the\nANOTHER project was\nconducted in secret.
AC1_7_01115	Sayoko and I were handpicked by\nthe lab's head to carry the\nproject forward.
AC1_7_01116	You were just a researcher...\nA useful tool.
AC1_7_01117	That's all I was to you?
AC1_7_01118	We started making real progress.
AC1_7_01119	But then Sayoko betrayed us.
AC1_7_01120	You two stole our research,\nhid it in your home.
AC1_7_01121	So I gave Sayoko one more\nchance that night.
AC1_7_01122	I told her to return the research\nand return to the fold.
AC1_7_01123	But Sayoko, she...
AC1_7_01124	She refused me. She chose you.
AC1_7_01125	So, this is farewell, Ashley. It was\nnice having you as a daughter,\nshort-lived as it was.
AC1_7_01126	...
AC1_7_01128	Ashley!
AC1_7_01130	...
AC1_7_01325	*gasp*
AC1_7_01357	(Exert Noise)
AC1_7_01133	Stop...
AC1_7_01135	Ah!
AC1_7_01317	(Exert noise)
AC1_7_01136	Stop this!
AC1_7_01137	Wh-what are you?!
AC1_7_01138	I won't let you hurt her.
AC1_7_01139	Nobody else will die.
AC1_7_01141	St-stay back!
AC1_7_01142	You... You...
AC1_7_01144	...
AC1_7_01147	...
AC1_7_01149	No!
AC1_7_01354	(Exert Noise)
AC1_7_01151	Bill!
AC1_7_01152	Richard...
AC1_7_01154	It's OK, just hang on!
AC1_7_01355	(Exert Noise)
AC1_7_01356	(Exert Noise)
AC1_7_01358	(Exert Noise)
AC1_7_01156	...
AC1_7_01319	(Exert Noise)
AC1_7_01159	Bill!
AC1_7_01359	(Exert Noise)
AC1_7_01326	(Exert Noise)
AC1_7_01360	(Exert Noise)
AC1_7_01324	(Exert Noise)
AC1_7_00529	Bill...
AC1_7_00530	Why did it have to end like this?
AC1_7_00532	Dad!
AC1_7_00535	Dad...
AC1_7_00539	Are you OK?
AC1_7_00540	I'm OK.
AC1_7_00542	You look sad.
AC1_7_00551	11 years ago, not long after your\nmother's funeral...
AC1_7_00552	He brought white flowers to her\ngrave. He was just standing\nthere, all alone...
AC1_7_00554	Even from a distance, I could\ntell how sad he looked.
AC1_7_00555	I couldn't bring myself to\napproach him...
AC1_7_01162	Did you ever suspect?
AC1_7_01163	That Bill might have been the\none who shot...
AC1_7_01164	No... Never.
AC1_7_01165	It never even crossed my mind.
AC1_7_01166	What are you going to do now?
AC1_7_01167	I need to figure out exactly what\nBill was up to.
AC1_7_01168	It looked like he was sending the\ndata from that computer.
AC1_7_00578	OK, we should be able to get back\ninside the mansion now.
AC1_7_00580	Let's go help Jessica.
AC1_7_00582	*sigh*
AC1_7_00584	Ashley? Are you OK?
AC1_7_00585	Yeah. It's just been a long day.
AC1_7_00586	Right. Of course.
AC1_7_00588	You should get some rest.
AC1_7_00589	OK. But what about you?
AC1_7_00590	I'm going to go get your aunt.
AC1_7_00592	And then we'll all go\nhome together.
AC1_7_00596	Hm...
AC1_7_01170	There's a notebook.
AC1_7_01172	This must be Bill's notebook.
AC1_7_01173	There's something stuck in it...
AC1_7_01174	Looks like a photo.
AC1_7_01175	Is this Bill as a kid?
AC1_7_01176	So I guess this would be his mom.
AC1_7_01178	Ashley... I think that's Frannie.
AC1_7_01179	Which must mean Bill was\nFrannie's son.
AC1_7_01180	Whoa...
AC1_7_01181	When did you realize?
AC1_7_01182	I had a suspicion when I saw him\nin the drawing room.
AC1_7_01183	It was his eyes. They looked so\nmuch like Frannie's.
AC1_7_01186	D...
AC1_7_01187	You saved my life.
AC1_7_01188	I didn't want anyone to die.
AC1_7_01189	Not even Bill.
AC1_7_01190	Enough bad things have\nhappened on this island.
AC1_7_01192	It came back to me.
AC1_7_01193	When your dad reached his hand\nout for Bill...
AC1_7_01194	I remembered my death.
AC1_7_01195	That day, all those years ago...
AC1_7_01196	I was running from Uncle Henry\nand wound up here.
AC1_7_01197	He caught up to me...
AC1_7_01321	(Exert Noise)
AC1_7_01200	Daniel, stop!
AC1_7_01201	Stop running! Your heart, it can't—
AC1_7_01203	But I was so scared. So I kept running.\nI ran all the way to the cliff.
AC1_7_01204	And when I stopped at the edge...
AC1_7_01322	(Exert Noise)
AC1_7_01209	Daniel, please! Be careful!
AC1_7_01210	Come here!
AC1_7_01323	(Exert Noise)
AC1_7_01218	I remember now.
AC1_7_01219	The last thing I saw...
AC1_7_01220	was a hand reaching out to me.
AC1_7_01221	Uncle Henry's hand.
AC1_7_01223	Huh?
AC1_7_01226	Ashley!
AC1_7_01228	Jessica!
AC1_7_01229	You're safe.
AC1_7_01230	You made it!
AC1_7_01232	I was so worried.
AC1_7_01233	It's OK. I'm here. You aren't hurt,\nare you?
AC1_7_01234	I'm so glad you're OK.
AC1_7_01237	Ashley?! Is she OK?
AC1_7_01238	She's fine.
AC1_7_01239	Just exhausted. She's been\nthrough a lot.
AC1_7_01240	Of course.
AC1_7_01241	I keep thinking about Bill.
AC1_7_01242	How could this have happened?
AC1_7_01243	He used to be optimistic. So full\nof hope.
AC1_7_01244	He never would have done\nsomething like this.
AC1_7_01245	That was the Bill I knew too.
AC1_7_01246	But seeing him now, for the first\ntime in years...
AC1_7_01247	He was so full of anger.
AC1_7_01248	When did he change?
AC1_7_01249	I really can't say...
AC1_7_01251	Hmm...
AC1_7_01252	Ugh...
AC1_7_01253	Ashley. Do you hurt anywhere?
AC1_7_01254	Let's get her some fresh air.
AC1_7_01256	There's an exit this way. It leads\nto the coast.
AC1_7_01262	Hmm?
AC1_7_01265	This place...
AC1_7_01266	It's the cove.
AC1_7_01267	It was in the painting by\nUncle Henry.
AC1_7_00826	Do you hear that?
AC1_7_00827	Is it the boat?
AC1_7_00830	Heeeey!
AC1_7_00832	Heeeey!
AC1_7_00833	Ahoy there!
AC1_7_00834	That voice...
AC1_7_00836	If it isn't the young miss!
AC1_7_00837	Captain!
AC1_7_00843	You look like you've had quite\nthe day.
AC1_7_00844	Hey, Captain!
AC1_7_00845	You weren't at the dock when\nI arrived, so I went looking.
AC1_7_00846	I was starting to worry. Glad to\nsee you're safe.
AC1_7_00847	Thanks for coming.
AC1_7_00849	And I see you've met up with your\ndad, eh? Great!
AC1_7_00850	Yeah, well...
AC1_7_00851	What's wrong? You tired?
AC1_7_00852	A little, yeah.
AC1_7_00853	You and me both.
AC1_7_00854	It's all part of growing up, one\nexhausting day at a time.
AC1_7_00855	Hehe.
AC1_7_00856	Did I say something funny?
AC1_7_00857	I wish I could tell you the whole\nstory, Captain.
AC1_7_00858	Even you would be shocked!
AC1_7_00859	Is that right?
AC1_7_00860	Yeah.
AC1_7_00861	Out of curiosity, young miss...
AC1_7_00863	Who's that next to you? Did you\nmake a friend?
AC1_7_00864	...
AC1_7_00865	...
AC1_7_00866	You can see D?
AC1_7_00868	...
AC1_7_00869	Whoops. Hope I didn't scare the\nboy off.
AC1_7_00870	D?
AC1_7_01271	I haven't been off this island in\n11 years... I wonder how the world\nhas changed.
AC1_7_01272	It's OK to take it slow. One day\nat a time.
AC1_7_01273	I have a lot of catching up to do.\nAll the new research papers\nalone... I was only able to glean\nso much from the news.
AC1_7_01274	Catching up on the latest tech\nwill be a lot of work too.
AC1_7_01275	Are you going to keep working\nas a scientist once we're back?
AC1_7_01276	I haven't thought about it yet.\nI've never done anything other\nthan research.
AC1_7_01277	Well, is there something else you\nwant to do?
AC1_7_01278	Something else I want to do...\nI suppose...
AC1_7_01279	I'd like to enjoy a family meal.
AC1_7_01282	The day got a bit crazy, huh?\nYou must be tired.
AC1_7_01283	Totally wiped.
AC1_7_01284	It wasn't too easy for you either,\nthough, right?
AC1_7_01285	That's for sure. But I'm OK...\nThanks to you.
AC1_7_01286	Let's take it easy when we get\nback. It's almost your birthday.\nYou should rest up.
AC1_7_00877	...
AC1_7_00878	D! Here you are.
AC1_7_00879	Ashley...
AC1_7_00880	You must have been pretty shocked\nthat the captain saw you, huh?
AC1_7_00881	Yeah... I didn't think there were\nany adults who could see me.
AC1_7_00884	Hey, Ashley?
AC1_7_00885	What's up?
AC1_7_00886	I've...
AC1_7_00888	I've had fun spending time with you.
AC1_7_00998	*gasp*
AC1_7_00889	That was fun?
AC1_7_00891	Being with you was.
AC1_7_00892	You helped me remember\neverything from my life.
AC1_7_00893	So, thank you.
AC1_7_00894	What's this about?
AC1_7_00896	I'm glad I met you, Ashley.
AC1_7_00897	What's going on? You're acting weird.
AC1_7_00898	Hm...
AC1_7_00899	Come on, D.
AC1_7_01288	Touch my hand.
AC1_7_01292	Thank you, Ashley.
AC1_7_01295	Ashley, can you...see me?
AC1_7_01297	Can't believe I've made friends with a ghost...
AC1_7_01298	What a day.
AC1_7_01300	That's why it's so important that\nI regain my lost memories.
AC1_7_01302	It's not that easy, D. I'm... I'm scared.
AC1_7_01304	It'll be OK.
AC1_7_01305	Even though facing the truth can be hard...
AC1_7_01306	in the end, it's always for the best.
AC1_7_01308	I'll be right here by your side...
AC1_7_01309	Until you've remembered everything.
AC1_7_00900	Ashley...
AC1_7_00901	I'm glad that you don't have\nto be alone anymore.
AC1_7_00902	What?
AC1_7_00904	Well...
AC1_7_00905	Now that I have my memories back...
AC1_7_00906	I think I can move on.
AC1_7_00907	D...
AC1_7_00910	Ashley.
AC1_7_00918	D!
AC1_7_00919	Out of everyone on this island...
AC1_7_00920	you're the only one who really gets me.
AC1_7_00921	Hm...
AC1_7_00923	Goodbye, Ashley.
AC1_7_00924	D!
AC1_7_01320	(Exert Noise)
AC1_7_01313	Father...
AC1_7_00928	You finally got to pass on...
AC1_7_00931	Thanks for everything, D.
AC1_7_00932	So long.
AC1_7_00938	Hey! We're shoving off!
AC1_7_00940	It's time to go, Ashley.
AC1_7_00942	Dad, look.
AC1_7_01316	Hm...
AC1_7_00943	Wow. What a beautiful moon.
AC1_7_00944	Yeah...
AC1_7_00945	You know...
AC1_7_01000	I would sometimes come\nout to this cove at night.
AC1_7_00946	I'd look up at that blue moon and\nI'd think about you and Sayoko.
AC1_7_00947	Dad...
AC1_7_00948	Did you ever wonder where your\nmiddle name Mizuki comes from?
AC1_7_00949	It's Japanese, same as your mother.
AC1_7_01001	It means, "beautiful moon."
AC1_7_00950	Beautiful moon, huh?
AC1_7_00951	I think it's a pretty name.
AC1_7_00952	Isn't it?
AC1_7_00953	It was your mother's idea.
AC1_7_00955	Ashley.
AC1_7_00956	What's up?
AC1_7_00957	Happy birthday.
AC1_7_00959	Is this...
AC1_7_00960	It belonged to Sayoko.
AC1_7_00961	I think...you should have it.
AC1_7_00963	Thank you.
AC1_7_00966	Your hands are pretty warm, huh?
AC1_7_00967	Are they?
AC1_7_00968	Hey, Dad?
AC1_7_00969	It's been a weird day.
AC1_7_00971	Today was a lot to take on...
AC1_7_00972	But I'll remember it forever.
AC1_7_00973	My day on this island...
AC1_7_00974	The day before my 14th birthday.
AC1_Mystery_7_5_00027	The desk looks out of place in a cave.
AC1_Mystery_7_5_00028	Was Bill using this computer?
AC1_Mystery_7_5_00029	The desk looks out of place in a cave.
AC1_Mystery_7_5_00004	The laptop looks like it was used recently.
AC1_Mystery_7_5_00030	It's Bill's notebook.
AC1_Mystery_7_5_00021	There's a handwritten message on the back.
AC1_Mystery_7_5_00022	With my dear son, Bill.
AC1_Mystery_7_5_00031	There's something in\nthat notebook.
AC1_Mystery_7_5_00032	You mean this notebook?
AC1_Mystery_7_5_00033	I think that chime came from\nthe computer.
AC1_Mystery_7_5_00034	There's a microphone.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00021	Wells must have loved books.\nThere's a ton in here and on\nthe desk.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00022	There are different types of books on the\nbookshelf.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00023	So many books... Pretty\nimpressive if anyone read\nthem all.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00024	There's gotta be something in\nhere... Oh, guess not.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00025	There's an old briefcase, but it's empty.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00026	Figures the butler's bed is made\nperfectly. It's not even wrinkled!
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00027	The bed is neatly made without a single wrinkle.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00028	It's so neatly made... Whoever\nslept here kept things nice.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00029	Guess this book was bedtime\nreading.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00030	There is a thick book and a mug on the\nside table.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00031	Huh. Just a totally empty\nwardrobe.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00032	The only thing in this wardrobe is cobwebs.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00033	No one's used this bucket in\nages—it's all rusted.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00034	There's an old, rusty bucket off to the side\nof the room.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00035	The drawers are totally empty.\nNot even trash or anything.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00036	All the drawers are empty. It is neatly cleaned\nand organized.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00037	I guess Wells kept all this\ntableware super organized.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00038	Different kinds of tableware are organized\nby type.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00039	All this tableware is glass or\nchina—no silver.
AC1_Obj_flavor_but_00040	Wine glasses, teacups, and\ndishes... It's all so pretty.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cav_00017	This wooden box is addressed to\nBill. I wonder what was in it.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cav_00018	There's a label on this wooden box with Bill's\nname on it.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cav_00019	The lights are all on. Guess that's\nwhy the cave is so bright.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cav_00020	The soft light is illuminating the dark cave.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cav_00021	With no one around on the\nisland, I wonder what'll happen\nto this watermill.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cav_00022	Will it just keep turning and\nturning until it breaks someday?
AC1_Obj_flavor_cav_00023	The water makes a lot of noise going through\nthe hydroelectric generator.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cav_00024	Once we leave here, no one will\nmaintain this thing.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cav_00025	The generator's meter is still working.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cav_00028	There's a LOT of cigarette butts\nin this ashtray. Didn't anyone\nclean this place?
AC1_Obj_flavor_cav_00029	There are many cigarette butts in this\ndirty ashtray.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ce1_00009	There are some old, dried-up\nflowers in the vase.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ce1_00010	The flowers have wilted since they were left in\nthe vase without any water.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ce1_00011	It's hard to see in the dark, but\nI like the pattern on this vase.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ce1_00012	Too bad the vase is so dirty—the\npattern on it is really nice.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ce1_00013	The window is too fogged up to\nget a good look at the view.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ce1_00014	You can almost see the outside view through\nthe fogged window.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ce1_00015	Aw, this lamp looks like a flower\nbud! Pity it isn't lit.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ce1_00016	There are many lamps shaped like flower buds\non the wall.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cou_00014	This garden bench looks perfect for taking a\nbreak on.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cou_00015	Just realized how tired I am. That\nbench is looking pretty tempting.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cou_00016	No, I have to get to D.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cou_00017	My feet are killing me after all\nthis walking, but I can't afford to\nstop and take a break.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cou_00018	I need to find Dad so he can\nhelp Jessica.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cou_00019	Sprinklers are still working.\nThey look old, but it looks like\nsomeone's been taking care\nof them.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cou_00020	Otherwise, they wouldn't be\nblooming so beautifully.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cou_00021	These flowers look well taken care of, with\nmany beautiful blooms.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cou_00022	You can see the ocean from\nhere. How pretty...
AC1_Obj_flavor_cw1_00007	There are lots of flower-bud\nlamps. I guess someone who\nlived here loved flowers.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cw1_00008	This probably lit up beautifully\nat night.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cw1_00009	They must have fallen from the\nceiling. Yikes...
AC1_Obj_flavor_cw1_00010	Did no one fix the second floor?
AC1_Obj_flavor_cw1_00011	This vase is pretty dirty. I can't\ntell what the design on it is.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cw1_00012	The vase by the stairs is extremely dirty.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cw1_00013	You can find comfy seating in\nevery corner of this mansion.\nSomeone was living the dream.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cw1_00014	There's a cozy sitting area in the hallway.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cw1_00015	This painting of a full moon is\nso pretty. It has an almost\nfantastical feel to it.
AC1_Obj_flavor_cw1_00016	There's a painting of a full moon.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00046	Birds and a scale? What is this\nimage?
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00047	They probably used this stuff in\nthe mine.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00048	Judging by the rust, these\nhaven't been used in a long time.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00049	The construction tools have all rusted and\naren't usable.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00050	This sign's pretty faded, but I\ncan still read it.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00051	WARNING\nGold mine closed.\nNo entry!
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00052	Edward Company
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00055	WARNING\nGold mine closed.\nNo entry!
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00056	Edward Company
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00057	It's a cart full of rocks.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00058	Are these rocks...valuable?\nI have no idea.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00059	The rocks in the cart are mostly black, but with\nhints of yellow.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00060	This cart got knocked over\nsomehow.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00061	Did a rock fall on it and knock\nit over?
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00062	A derailed cart is on its side and abandoned.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00063	I wonder if I could use this to go\nover the fence...
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00064	Hmm... No good. It's not tall\nenough.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00065	There's an old wooden box. It's not big enough\nto boost you over.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00066	Maybe I can use this to climb\nover the fence.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00067	Ugh. The wood is all rotted. It'll\nprobably break if I get on top.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00068	There are boxes that seem like they could be\nused to climb the fence, but they're too rotten\nto stand on safely.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00069	That red intake tower doesn't\nseem to be too damaged.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00070	Is it still being used?
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00071	This intake tower seems fairly clean and\nmaintained.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00072	The entrance to the tunnel is\nclosed off. It's dark in there so\nI can't see up ahead at all.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00073	Can't go in there. It's too dark\nand I don't think Jessica came\nthrough here.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dep_00074	The tunnel is dark and sealed\noff. Doesn't look like anyone's\nset foot in there in ages.
AC1_Obj_flavor_din_00015	There are lots of wine glasses\nhere. Did they entertain a lot?
AC1_Obj_flavor_din_00016	There are many wine glasses and bottles of\nspirits, presumably for hosting parties.
AC1_Obj_flavor_din_00017	There's a teapot and cups, all\nready to go.
AC1_Obj_flavor_din_00018	How long has this tea set been\nsitting here?
AC1_Obj_flavor_din_00019	This plate has a picture of a\nlake or something.
AC1_Obj_flavor_din_00020	The plate's dirty—I can't tell what\nlake this might be.
AC1_Obj_flavor_din_00021	This plate is so dirty it's hard to make out the\nlake scene.
AC1_Obj_flavor_din_00022	Another plate with a picture of\na bird. It's really dirty.
AC1_Obj_flavor_din_00023	As elsewhere in the mansion, there is a picture\nof a bird on this plate.
AC1_Obj_flavor_din_00024	Oh, she's beautiful! I wonder who\nshe is...
AC1_Obj_flavor_din_00026	There's a painting of a woman's profile\non the wall.
AC1_Obj_flavor_din_00025	The fireplace is piled up with ashes.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00024	That cushion looks soft. Seems\nlike a comfy chair to sit in.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00025	I'd love to sit in a chair like this\nwith a nice cup of tea.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00026	It's a comfortable-looking chair with fancy\ndecorations.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00027	Huh. This big sofa isn't dirty,\nunlike the other ones.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00028	This two-seat sofa is surprisingly dust-free.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00029	It was hard to tell in the dark...
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00030	but these candleholders are\nantique and really cute.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00031	The candleholder is quite faded. It hasn't been\nused in a long time.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00032	These glasses are all cloudy.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00033	I wonder if polish would help.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00034	There are two cloudy wine glasses on\nthe counter.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00035	Are ALL these bottles alcohol?
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00036	Maybe when I'm an adult, I'll\nknow about different types of\nalcohol.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00037	Hey, this newspaper is recent!
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00038	I bet Dad was reading the\nnewspaper. Does he get it\ndelivered to the island?
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00039	This ashtray is filthy. You have\nto wash them when you clear the\ncigarette butts out, you know.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00040	The cigarette butts were thrown out, but there\nis a hardened crust of ashes on the bottom.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00041	This bottle is opened but not\nempty. Was it opened recently?
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00042	A few bottles are half empty and left out.
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00043	There's something in this glass...\nPhew—what a smell!
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00044	I wonder if Dad likes stuff like\nthis...
AC1_Obj_flavor_dis_00045	There's still a bit of alcohol left in the glass.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ent_00014	These chandeliers are amazing!\nI've only ever seen stuff like this\non TV.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ent_00015	It's probably even more beautiful\nwhen it's lit up.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ent_00016	There are extravagant chandeliers hanging\nhere in the foyer.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ent_00017	These pillars look like real\nmarble!
AC1_Obj_flavor_ent_00018	These patterned pillars go all the way up to the\nceiling.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ent_00019	This looks like a stand for\ncandles. It's pretty dirty.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ent_00020	It probably hasn't been cleaned\nsince the last time it was used...
AC1_Obj_flavor_ent_00021	The candle holder is covered in cobwebs.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ent_00022	Some kind of decorative plate,\nI guess.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ent_00023	It's too dirty to tell what's on it.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ent_00024	When something is this dirty, it's\njust ruined. Doesn't matter how\ngreat it was at first.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ent_00025	This vase is cool. The pattern\nreally grabs your attention.
AC1_Obj_flavor_ent_00026	There's a golden flower pattern on this\nred vase.
AC1_Obj_flavor_for_00007	I wonder where this river is\nflowing from.
AC1_Obj_flavor_for_00008	Maybe over there?
AC1_Obj_flavor_for_00009	The river's clear water is flowing fast.
AC1_Obj_flavor_for_00010	It looks like the path follows the\nriver upstream.
AC1_Obj_flavor_for_00013	Only Edward family members\npermitted past this point.
AC1_Obj_flavor_fra_00017	The closet's empty. Frannie's\nclothes aren't even in here.
AC1_Obj_flavor_fra_00018	It's Frannie's closet. There's nothing inside.
AC1_Obj_flavor_fra_00019	I wish I could see what kind of\nclothes she had...
AC1_Obj_flavor_fra_00020	Was this her favorite sofa?\nThere are blocks and books on it.
AC1_Obj_flavor_fra_00021	There are toys scattered on this small sofa.\nSomeone was playing here.
AC1_Obj_flavor_fra_00022	A little green desk. Did Frannie\ndo her studying here?
AC1_Obj_flavor_fra_00023	A small, green desk that was presumably\nFrannie's.
AC1_Obj_flavor_fra_00024	Aw, the handles are so cute!
AC1_Obj_flavor_fra_00025	Anything inside the drawers?\n...Nope.
AC1_Obj_flavor_fra_00026	There is a cute but empty dresser.
AC1_Obj_flavor_fra_00027	I had a low table like this when I\nwas little.
AC1_Obj_flavor_fra_00028	It was great for drawing or\nplaying house.
AC1_Obj_flavor_fra_00029	There's a children's book on this\nchild-sized table.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00027	Wow, these shelves are so full of\nbooks! I wonder how long it\nwould take to read them all.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00028	This bookshelf is filled with books of various\ngenres.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00029	This sofa is so nice! It's big and\ncomfy.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00030	But it's probably not great for\nwatching TV from here...
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00031	It's a beautiful, scarlet sofa made of velvet.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00032	This marble table looks\nexpensive. It's also kinda cold\nwhen you touch it.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00033	This nice marble table has an old newspaper\nand some books on it.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00034	Where's the power button? Is\nthere a remote for this thing?
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00035	It's an old-fashioned TV. Pretty small screen\nfor such a big room...
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00036	This closet has been cleared out.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00037	Whoever cleared this closet out was thorough.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00038	There's a bunch of different\nkinds of alcohol from all over\nthe world.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00039	There are vintage liquors and antique\ntableware.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00040	It's pretty dusty up close. Makes\nsense, I suppose.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00041	The bed is neatly made but covered in dust.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00042	This pitcher is filthy. Guess it's\nbeen gathering dust a long time.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00043	This elegant, flower-patterned pitcher is\ntoo dirty to use.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00044	Candleholders by the bed... Is\nthis what they used for light?
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00045	I'd be too scared to have open\nflames right by my bed.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00046	A candleholder with three candles, apparently\nfor use as a bedside light.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00047	Oh, neat—a quill pen. I always\nwanted to try one.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00048	...No good. It's all dried out and\nhardened. Can't write a thing.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00049	The quill and ink are both unusable.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00050	The lampshade is all faded.\nBase is dirty too.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00051	I wonder what color it was\noriginally.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00052	This old-fashioned lamp is quite faded now.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00053	Is this painting of Frannie? It\nlooks a lot like the sketch in the\nart studio.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00054	Weird to think that D was friends\nwith her all those years ago.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00055	A painting of Frannie smiles at you.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00056	This is a nice table. And it's not\nbroken or anything, even after\nall this time.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00057	Someone left a book open here—\nwere they looking something up?
AC1_Obj_flavor_gol_00058	This is a well-made table that seems to have\nseen many years' use.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00029	Whose grave is this?
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00030	There's too much moss—I can't\nread what it says.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00031	The gravestone is overgrown with moss and\nis not legible.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00032	I wonder how long it's been since\nsomeone took care of this place.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00033	There are weeds and dead\nleaves covering everything.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00034	It would be a lot of work to clean\nthis place up.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00035	This grave is in rough shape.\nIt must be really old.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00036	This gravestone is damaged and can't be\nread at all.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00037	Huh. Is this a grave too? I've\nnever seen one that looks\nlike this...
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00038	There is a uniquely shaped gravestone.\nThe text is no longer legible.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00039	There's so much moss! How old\nis this one?
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00040	I can't read it through all\nthe moss.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00041	This one's pretty impressive...\nand I can make out some words...
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00042	William Wells. Was he part of the\nEdwards family?
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00043	This grave is a little more impressive than the\nothers and belongs to someone named Wells.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00044	This grave is smaller than\nthe others.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00045	Is a child buried here?
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00046	This grave is small and unassuming.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00055	Was this big stone a grave for D?
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00056	Whoever put it here must have\ncared about him.
AC1_Obj_flavor_gra_00057	The rock next to the door has the letter "D"\ninscribed on it.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00027	The fireplace poker is just lying\nout. Did someone forget to put\nit back?
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00028	The fireplace has nothing in it but the\nold poker.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00029	The bottles and glasses are all\ncovered in dust. I wonder if the\nstuff inside is OK to drink.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00030	The bottles and glasses are coated in a thick\nlayer of dust.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00031	This TV is ancient! I've never\nseen one like this.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00032	A CRT television with a small screen and dials\nto change the channels.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00033	This bed is huge! There's easily\nroom for two adult-sized people\nto share it.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00034	The bed is neatly made but has obviously not\nbeen used for a long time.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00035	There are a lot of books in here,\nbut they all look complicated and\nboring.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00036	This bookshelf goes all the way to the ceiling\nand is filled with impressive-looking books.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00037	Was someone in the middle of\nthis book? I wonder how long it's\nbeen sitting here.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00038	It's like time has just stopped in\nthis place for decades...
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00039	There are books, a pitcher, and two mugs on\nthe sideboard.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00040	It's really rusty.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00041	You can't even see the cute\nflower design.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00042	This candle holder with a flower motif is\nrusted all over.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00043	It's empty. Did they just pack\neverything up when they left\nthe island?
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00044	This large closet is completely empty.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00045	How long has this old clock been\nstuck like this?
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00046	The pendulum clock on the wall hasn't moved\nin years.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00047	Wow—you could actually sit\non a big chair in front of the\nfireplace, like in a movie.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00048	There is a large chair facing the fireplace.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00049	I wonder if they all sat together\nand watched TV here.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00050	There's a vibrantly green love seat.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00051	With a pitcher this big, you don't\nhave to refill the water as often.
AC1_Obj_flavor_hen_00052	An elegant pitcher with a flower design.\nIt's empty.
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00025	This fridge is gigantic! It's like\na grocery store all its own!
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00026	It's a large fridge with multiple doors.
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00027	I guess they needed more stoves\nthan most people to make all\nthe food...
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00028	It doesn't seem usable now.\nHow did Dad make his food?
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00029	There are multiple stoves that haven't been\nused in many years.
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00030	I guess a sink this big makes it\neasier to wash a lot of dishes.
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00031	A large kitchen sink. Dirty cups and dishes\nare scattered around.
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00032	Seems to be empty.
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00033	Looks like a sturdy box. Did\nthey carry ingredients in it?
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00034	An empty wooden box, probably used to carry\ningredients.
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00035	This stool must be for when the\ncooks needed a break. Looks a\nlittle wobbly...
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00036	This stool's seen better days—\nI better not risk sitting on it.
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00037	There's so many different kinds\nof tableware here! So, so many...
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00038	They must have had guests over\nall the time.
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00039	There are too many plates and tea sets\nto count.
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00040	The windows are so dirty that\nall I see outside is a blur.
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00041	The windows are too dirty to see the view\noutside.
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00042	So many pots and pans. Cleaning\nthem all must have been a pain.
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00043	A variety of cooking utensils are above the\nstove and on the shelf.
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00044	This is a nice oven. I bet they\nbaked cakes and stuff in it.
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00045	Jessica bakes me a birthday cake\nevery year...
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00046	Gotta make sure we get to keep\nthat tradition alive this year.
AC1_Obj_flavor_kit_00047	A large oven that could easily accommodate\na whole turkey.
AC1_Obj_flavor_laa_00001	So this is the ANOTHER...\nWhat my dad spent 11 years\nof his life completing.
AC1_Obj_flavor_laa_00002	The ANOTHER, a device that can manipulate\nmemories, is in the center of the room.
AC1_Obj_flavor_laa_00003	My mom gave her life to protect\nthe ANOTHER. It's a relief\nto know it won't fall into the\nwrong hands.
AC1_Obj_flavor_laa_00004	The ANOTHER has been destroyed.\nIt's beyond repair.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00028	So many files! Are they all part\nof the same research?
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00029	There are blueprints, scientific papers, and\nother files stored here.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00030	This is addressed to...Richard\nRobins! It's for Dad!
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00031	The label says "Precision\nInstrument." I wonder what's\nin there.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00032	It's a wooden box addressed to Richard and\napparently containing a "precision instrument."
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00033	What is this thing? It looks like\na sci-fi gadget that someone's\nstill working on.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00034	A machine with exposed innards has been\nleft out.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00035	Is this box full of science stuff?
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00036	A cardboard box with unknown contents is on\nthe shelf.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00037	This chair is uncomfortable, and\nthe wheels are all wobbly.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00038	If you had to sit in this thing all\nday, you'd just be exhausted.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00039	This chair is well used, and the wheels are\ncoming loose.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00040	Is this Dad's locker? Maybe I'll\ntake a peek inside...
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00041	No, I shouldn't. Lockers are\nprivate.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00042	I won't go nosing around in\nthere without permission.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00043	Did Dad write this? I can't really\nmake sense of it.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00044	This blackboard is covered with technical\nterms and diagrams that weren't completely\nerased.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00045	I guess there's a blackboard so\nyou can take notes at any time.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00046	Some people are just really into\ntheir research and don't want\nto stop.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00047	Did Dad go to bed still thinking\nabout work?
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00048	This is Dad's locker. I wonder\nwhat's in there.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00049	No! I'm not going to go through\nhis stuff without permission!
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00050	Even family has to respect\nprivacy.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00051	This mattress is really hard.\nDoes Dad actually sleep on this?
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00052	Does he ache all the time?
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00064	I couldn't get a good night's sleep\nhere if I tried.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00053	This lab coat is wrinkled and\nkinda dirty. I wonder when it\nwas last washed.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00054	The lab coat has seen better days and is\ndirty with chalk dust.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00055	Funny to picture Dad standing\nat a blackboard, drawing with\nchalk like a school teacher...
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00056	All of the chalk is short and much-used.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00062	These folders are stuffed full\nwith papers.
AC1_Obj_flavor_lab_00063	These thick folders are filled with many pages\nof documentation.
AC1_Obj_flavor_mus_00001	It was a really nice fireplace, but\nnow it's old and worn down.
AC1_Obj_flavor_mus_00002	This well-built fireplace is clearly neglected\nand is covered in cobwebs.
AC1_Obj_flavor_mus_00003	Wow—this lady in the painting is\nso beautiful!
AC1_Obj_flavor_mus_00004	A woman in an elegant dress is depicted.
AC1_Obj_flavor_mus_00005	Oh, I think this is the bridge in\nfront of the mansion! It looks\nbrand-new here.
AC1_Obj_flavor_mus_00006	The painting shows the bridge near\nthe mansion back when it was new.
AC1_Obj_flavor_mus_00007	I can't even tell what's on here.
AC1_Obj_flavor_mus_00008	Looks like maybe a landscape,\nbut it's so dirty it's hard to tell.
AC1_Obj_flavor_mus_00009	It's a decorative plate that's so covered in dust\nthat you can't make out the illustration.
AC1_Obj_flavor_mus_00010	This flower-pattern vase is\nreally cute. So many little\nflowers!
AC1_Obj_flavor_mus_00011	It's a vase painted with many small, purple\nflowers.
AC1_Obj_flavor_pai_00023	There are a lot of canvases\nhere, and they're all faded.
AC1_Obj_flavor_pai_00024	These canvases are all covered in dust.
AC1_Obj_flavor_pai_00025	Rags and paper inside. Drawing\nsupplies, I suppose.
AC1_Obj_flavor_pai_00026	A sorting shelf with extra rags and paper.\nNothing looks particularly useful.
AC1_Obj_flavor_pai_00027	It's such a beautiful piece, and\nit's all covered in spiderwebs.\nSad, really...
AC1_Obj_flavor_pai_00028	The easel holds an elaborate painting.
AC1_Obj_flavor_pai_00029	I think I've seen these on TV,\nbut this one's smaller than I've\nseen before.
AC1_Obj_flavor_pai_00030	The sunlight shining through the window\nilluminates the plaster goddess statue subtly.
AC1_Obj_flavor_pai_00031	Is this for oil painting? It's\ncompletely hardened now.
AC1_Obj_flavor_pai_00032	The palette has hardened oil paint all over it.
AC1_Obj_flavor_pai_00033	This looks like the kind of paint\nreal artists use.
AC1_Obj_flavor_pai_00034	Some of these still have some\npaint inside, but it's all hard and\nunusable.

AC1_Obj_flavor_stu_00024	I bet they could be salvaged with\na thorough cleaning.

ACR_Item_flavor_00412	My precious teddy bear, stuffed\nwith memories from Blood Edward\nIsland. I rescued it from Sofia's\ntrash can. I'm so glad I got it back.
ACR_Item_flavor_00413	Chocolate
ACR_Item_flavor_00414	Sweet and tasty chocolate. There\nwere a lot of these in the desk in\nDad's lab... Is this all he eats?\nI'm seriously worried about\nhis teeth.
ACR_Item_flavor_00415	J.C. Valley Pamphlet
ACR_Item_flavor_00417	IC Chip
ACR_Item_flavor_00418	A small object with an image of a\nkey on it... It was in Sofia's trash\ncan. It looks like it could be\ninserted into some sort of device.
ACR_Item_flavor_00419	Mom's Pendant
ACR_Item_flavor_00420	A teardrop-shaped pendant Dad\ngave me as a memento of Mom. It\nused to have liquid memory inside.\nLiquid memory that stored Mom's\nmemories... But it's empty now.
ACR_Item_flavor_00422	Maybe I should exchange the\nempty cans I found for tokens.
ACR_Item_flavor_00423	I can't find any more empty cans\nlaying around. I guess I found\nthem all.
ACR_Item_flavor_00424	I wonder what would happen if I\ntried to recycle a full can...
ACR_Item_flavor_00425	What am I thinking?! I can't waste\nsuch a tasty beverage like that!
ACR_Item_flavor_00426	Plus, it might break the machine!
ACR_Item_flavor_00427	I should only put empty cans in.
ACR_Item_flavor_00428	This token is a different color\nthan the rest. What's that mean?
ACR_Item_flavor_00429	What's that? I just noticed\nsomething written on top\nof the machine.
ACR_Item_flavor_00430	A commemorative token will be dispensed when\nthe can recycler is full.
ACR_Item_flavor_00431	So is this the commemorative\ntoken, then?
ACR_Item_flavor_00432	I haven't come across any more\nempty cans, so I guess this is the\nend. So long, can recycler.
ACR_Item_flavor_00433	What's this?
ACR_Item_flavor_00434	Can recycler: Earn tokens by recycling!
ACR_Item_flavor_00435	Tokens can be used at gumball machines\naround the lake.
ACR_Item_flavor_00436	Oh, this is the can recycler\nTommy told me about.
ACR_Item_flavor_00437	I should put any empty cans I\nfind in here.
ACR_Item_flavor_00438	What's this?
ACR_Item_flavor_00439	Can recycler: Earn tokens by recycling!
ACR_Item_flavor_00440	Tokens can be used at gumball machines.
ACR_Item_flavor_00441	Huh. So I'll get tokens just by\nputting empty cans in here.
ACR_Item_flavor_00442	I should keep this in mind for if\nI find any.
ACR_Item_flavor_00443	I can use tokens to get gumballs\nfrom this.
ACR_Item_flavor_00444	I don't have any more tokens and\nI don't think there are any more\nempty cans around. So I guess\nthat's the end of it.
ACR_Item_flavor_00445	The machine won't take this one.
ACR_Item_flavor_00446	I guess I'll keep it as a souvenir.
ACR_Item_flavor_00447	I can only put tokens in the\ngumball machine.
ACR_Item_flavor_00448	Oh, huh. This gumball's different\nthan the others. Is it supposed to\nbe lucky gum or something?
ACR_Item_flavor_00449	I should show it to Tommy.
ACR_Item_flavor_00450	Oh, huh. This gumball's different\nthan the others. Is it supposed to\nbe lucky gum or something?
ACR_Item_flavor_00451	I should ask Tommy about it when\nhe gets back.
ACR_Item_flavor_00452	Say, isn't that the winning\ngumball?
ACR_Item_flavor_00453	What are you doing walking\naround with it? Take it to\nthe guesthouse before a bird\nflies off with it or something!
ACR_Item_flavor_00505	Hey, Tommy? I got this.
ACR_Item_flavor_00506	Whoa, the winning gumball!\nBig congrats!
ACR_Item_flavor_00507	Bring it to the guesthouse later\nand I'll give you the prize.
ACR_Item_flavor_00455	Mm. Tasty.
ACR_Item_flavor_00456	It's strawberry flavored!
ACR_Item_flavor_00457	Hmm... This mystery flavor\nseems to be...
ACR_Item_flavor_00458	Mint. Refreshing!
ACR_Item_flavor_00459	A second piece of red gum. The\nstrawberry flavor is tasty.
ACR_Item_flavor_00462	This mint flavor sure is strong.
ACR_Item_flavor_00465	Sweet and a little tart.
ACR_Item_flavor_00466	This gum is orange flavored!
ACR_Item_flavor_00467	Ohh, it's sour...
ACR_Item_flavor_00468	This gum is lemon flavored.
ACR_Item_flavor_00469	It's really sweet!
ACR_Item_flavor_00470	This gum has gotta be\nmelon flavored.
ACR_Item_flavor_00471	Oh! It's bubbly!
ACR_Item_flavor_00472	This gum is soda flavored. Wasn't\nexpecting that.
ACR_Item_flavor_00473	Yep, tastes like it looks.
ACR_Item_flavor_00474	This gum is grape flavored.
ACR_Item_flavor_00475	Wow. This flavor... It's...
ACR_Item_flavor_00476	Melon, grape, mint... Lemon...\nSoda, orange, and strawberry!
ACR_Item_flavor_00477	It's every flavor in one! I've\nnever had such an interesting\ngum-chewing experience before.
ACR_Item_flavor_00478	I need to show this to Tommy\nbefore I eat it!
ACR_Item_flavor_00508	This isn't the time to start a\nconversation about gum.
ACR_Item_flavor_00509	I'll bring it up later.
ACR_Item_flavor_00479	Hmm, this is...
ACR_Item_flavor_00480	It's pineapple cider! How tasty.\nSuper refreshing!
ACR_Item_flavor_00481	The blue can was a weird choice\nfor pineapple, but whatever.
ACR_Item_flavor_00482	Hmm... I think this one is...
ACR_Item_flavor_00483	Some sort of berry flavor?
ACR_Item_flavor_00484	If the can says it's cranberry,\nI guess I have to trust it.
ACR_Item_flavor_00485	Ahh...
ACR_Item_flavor_00486	I love Cool POP. It never fails\nto refresh me.
ACR_Item_flavor_00487	Mmm... Nice and crispy, just how\nI like them.
ACR_Item_flavor_00488	But what's that flavor? Sea salt?\nPizza? Hint of cream?
ACR_Item_flavor_00489	Whatever it is, I'm into it!
ACR_Item_flavor_00490	The more I chew, the more\nflavor comes through!
ACR_Item_flavor_00491	But I'm not a big jerky fan.
ACR_Item_flavor_00492	Maybe I should share some with\nDad when I see him.
ACR_Item_flavor_00493	The cream inside is so rich.
ACR_Item_flavor_00494	I detect no flaws in this cookie.
ACR_Item_flavor_00495	I have found the perfect snack.
ACR_Item_flavor_00496	Crisp... Sweet... An all-around\nsatisfying cookie experience.
ACR_Item_flavor_00497	Sometimes, if I don't have any\nchocolate-chip cookies handy...
ACR_Item_flavor_00498	I'll eat regular chocolate and\nplain cookies. Kind of like a\nDIY chocolate-chip cookie.
ACR_Item_flavor_00510	Yup! Delicious just like I thought!\nI love this brand.
ACR_Item_flavor_00499	This can't be used here.
ACR_Item_flavor_00500	This can't be used right now.
ACR_Item_flavor_00501	This can't be used right now.
ACR_Item_flavor_00502	This item can't be combined.

ACR_PuzzleHint_00239	If there's a DAS symbol with a button\non it, tilt the controller or system while\npressing that button.
ACR_PuzzleHint_00240	For example, if a DAS symbol with an R is\ndisplayed, hold the R Button while tilting\nin the direction of the arrow.
ACR_PuzzleHint_00241	Figure out which room Sofia is in by\ncomparing the room information on the\nscreen against the map of the building.
ACR_PuzzleHint_00242	The map shows where the office furniture is\nlocated. Figure out which room Sofia is in by\ncomparing the placement of furniture on the\ncamera feed with furniture on the map.
ACR_PuzzleHint_00243	Sofia is in the room that is third from the top\nwhen looking at the map.
ACR_PuzzleHint_00244	If two symbols appear, perform both\noperations simultaneously.
ACR_PuzzleHint_00245	When the DAS symbol looks like it's being\nviewed straight on, rotate the controller or\nsystem horizontally.
ACR_PuzzleHint_00246	If a DAS symbol looks like it's being viewed\nstraight on, place the controller or system\nflat and rotate it like a steering wheel.
ACR_PuzzleHint_00247	For example, if the DAS symbol appears as\nif straight on and is vertical and marked with\na Y, hold out the controller or system, turn it\nuntil it's vertical, and then hold the Y Button.
ACR_PuzzleHint_00248	Erase your mother's memories, but only hers.\nThe memories of events that you shouldn't\nknow must be hers.
ACR_PuzzleHint_00249	The images that have appeared in flashbacks\nare your memories. All of your memories\nshould be events you've seen before.
ACR_PuzzleHint_00250	These three memories are Sayoko's:\n・ Sayoko looking at a monitor\n・ Sayoko with a baby bump\n・ Sayoko soothing a baby
ACR_PuzzleHint_00252	Check the kaleidoscope on the gravestone.\nYou can rotate the pattern by turning the\noutside of the kaleidoscope.
ACR_PuzzleHint_00253	If you change the pattern by turning the\noutside of the kaleidoscope, letters should\nappear when it's aligned correctly.
ACR_PuzzleHint_00254	Four letters will appear when the pattern\nis lined up correctly. Pay attention to how\nthe straight lines meet and align.
ACR_PuzzleHint_00255	The letters on the gravestone's inscription\ncan be pressed. Press the letters that appear\nwithin the kaleidoscope's pattern.
ACR_PuzzleHint_00256	Starting from the left, enter the four letters\nfrom the kaleidoscope's pattern.
ACR_PuzzleHint_00257	Press the letters on the gravestone's\ninscription in the following order:\nL, O, V, E.
ACR_1_Scenario_00266	J.C. Valley\n1994
ACR_1_Scenario_00230	All visitors must check in at the guesthouse\nupon arrival.
ACR_1_Scenario_00231	You will receive a key card required for\naccessing the campsite.
ACR_1_Scenario_00004	Ugh, forget this. I'm just gonna\ngo home.
ACR_1_Scenario_00005	Oh, but... I guess I don't have\nmoney for a bus ticket...
ACR_1_Scenario_00006	Excuse me... Anyone around?
ACR_1_Scenario_00007	Customer here.
ACR_1_Scenario_00232	There's a room farther in...
ACR_1_Scenario_00233	Is it a storage room? Doesn't\nlook like anyone's around.
ACR_1_Scenario_00234	No one's here.
ACR_1_Scenario_00235	I wonder where the clerk is.
ACR_1_Scenario_00236	Must have stepped out...
ACR_1_Scenario_00008	Seems like bad business to not\nhave anyone here.
ACR_1_Scenario_00009	Maybe I'll just go.
ACR_1_Scenario_00209	The photo I just took...
ACR_1_Scenario_00211	Whoa, cool. The color changed!
ACR_1_Scenario_00210	It's so pretty.
ACR_1_Scenario_00212	I wonder how it turned out.
ACR_1_Scenario_00237	Whoa, cool. The color changed!
ACR_1_Scenario_00238	It's so pretty.
ACR_1_Scenario_00214	This isn't the photo I just took.
ACR_1_Scenario_00016	I bet you'll be able to find some\nhelp at the guesthouse now.
ACR_1_Scenario_00017	Why don't you go check?
ACR_1_Scenario_00018	This place is deserted.
ACR_1_Scenario_00020	The clerk isn't back yet?
ACR_1_Scenario_00021	Maybe they're in the backroom...
ACR_1_Scenario_00022	There's a door for employees.
ACR_1_Scenario_00023	The door is locked.
ACR_1_Scenario_00247	Excuse me... Anyone here?
ACR_1_Scenario_00248	No answer.
ACR_1_Scenario_00249	There's a door for employees.
ACR_1_Scenario_00250	The door is locked.
ACR_1_Scenario_00024	Oh, hey there. Have you\nchecked in yet?
ACR_1_Scenario_00025	That's employees only.
ACR_1_Scenario_00026	Take your time looking at\nthe souvenirs.
ACR_1_Scenario_00027	Oh, right...
ACR_1_Scenario_00028	I need to ask Tommy where Dad's\ncampsite is.
ACR_1_Scenario_00029	I need to ask Tommy where Dad's\ncampsite is.
ACR_1_Scenario_00030	What's up?
ACR_1_Scenario_00031	I meant to ask...
ACR_1_Scenario_00032	Where are the family campsites?
ACR_1_Scenario_00033	Not sure where you're\nstaying, huh?
ACR_1_Scenario_00034	Have fun out there!
ACR_1_Scenario_00036	This looks like a pamphlet for\nthe area.
ACR_1_Scenario_00037	This map of Lake Juliet should\nbe useful.
ACR_1_Scenario_00039	You can now display the map.
ACR_1_Scenario_00041	One pamphlet is enough.
ACR_1_Scenario_00043	There's a sign explaining the rock with\nunusual colors.
ACR_1_Scenario_00044	What's this?
ACR_1_Scenario_00045	"The Miraculous Rainbow Stone."
ACR_1_Scenario_00046	What makes it miraculous?
ACR_1_Scenario_00216	Huh. So if I check the photo\nI took...
ACR_1_Scenario_00218	And now...
ACR_1_Scenario_00217	I already took a photo of this.
ACR_1_Scenario_00215	I guess I should look at the photo\nI already have.
ACR_1_Scenario_00227	I can check it out whenever, so I\ndon't need to right now.
ACR_1_Scenario_00226	You're not gonna look?
ACR_1_Scenario_00225	Nah. I'll look later.
ACR_1_Scenario_00221	Well, spoiler warning, but the\ncolor changes in the photo.
ACR_1_Scenario_00220	They're super pretty. Check it\nout when you have a minute.
ACR_1_Scenario_00271	Huh. Interesting.
ACR_1_Scenario_00050	Looks like some souvenirs. But\nwho do I pay for them?
ACR_1_Scenario_00051	There's a variety of drinks in the fridge.
ACR_1_Scenario_00052	Looks pretty refreshing... Oh,\nthey have Cool POP! But there's\nno clerk to ring me up...
ACR_1_Scenario_00054	You need special tokens to get\ngumballs from that.
ACR_1_Scenario_00055	You get them by tossing empty\ncans into the can recycler.
ACR_1_Scenario_00056	Oh, got it.
ACR_1_Scenario_00057	Collect some empty cans and\ngive it a shot.
ACR_1_Scenario_00059	Oh, that gumball machine—
ACR_1_Scenario_00060	Only takes tokens from the can\nrecycler. Right?
ACR_1_Scenario_00061	Yep. But I forgot to mention...
ACR_1_Scenario_00062	If you get a gumball of a certain\ncolor, you'll get a prize.
ACR_1_Scenario_00063	Give it a shot when you have\na minute.
ACR_1_Scenario_00064	The shelf holds all sorts of souvenirs.
ACR_1_Scenario_00065	There's a variety of drinks in the fridge.
ACR_1_Scenario_00067	Huh... I feel like I've seen this\nbear character before...
ACR_1_Scenario_00068	But where?
ACR_1_Scenario_00069	There are bear dolls on the shelf.
ACR_1_Scenario_00071	This cup looks kind of stylish.
ACR_1_Scenario_00072	I bet Jessica would like it.
ACR_1_Scenario_00073	There are mugs with the Lake Juliet logo\non the shelf.
ACR_1_Scenario_00075	OK, this hat is like...classic\nsouvenir material.
ACR_1_Scenario_00076	I kinda like it though.
ACR_1_Scenario_00077	There are hats with the Lake Juliet logo\non the shelf.
ACR_1_Scenario_00079	Huh, that character's on these\nT-shirts too.
ACR_1_Scenario_00080	Definitely not brave enough to\npull off this hat-shirt combo...
ACR_1_Scenario_00081	There are T-shirts on the shelf with the mascot\ncharacters printed on them.
ACR_1_Scenario_00083	Ohh, potato chips...
ACR_1_Scenario_00084	Let's see, what flavors do\nthey have?
ACR_1_Scenario_00085	The basket contains some very tasty-looking\npotato chips.
ACR_1_Scenario_00087	I've had this beef jerky with the\ndaruma symbol before.
ACR_1_Scenario_00088	It's so good!
ACR_1_Scenario_00089	The basket contains beef jerky.
ACR_1_Scenario_00091	I've seen this around.
ACR_1_Scenario_00092	I've been wanting to try them.
ACR_1_Scenario_00093	There are cookies in a blue box on the shelf.
ACR_1_Scenario_00095	I loved these chocolate-chip\ncookies when I was younger.
ACR_1_Scenario_00096	I haven't had them in forever.\nMaybe I should buy a box.
ACR_1_Scenario_00097	There are cookies in a red box on the shelf.
ACR_1_Scenario_00099	Cool POP! Looks refreshing\nand delicious.
ACR_1_Scenario_00100	I am kinda thirsty...
ACR_1_Scenario_00101	The cans of Cool POP look refreshing\nand delicious.
ACR_1_Scenario_00103	This juice looks like my favorite\nflavor of Cool POP.
ACR_1_Scenario_00104	I wonder what flavor it\nactually is.
ACR_1_Scenario_00105	There's juice in a blue can that looks like\nCool POP.
ACR_1_Scenario_00107	Are the pink cans just juice?
ACR_1_Scenario_00108	What flavor is this? It's not\nalcoholic, is it?
ACR_1_Scenario_00109	There are pink cans of juice.
ACR_1_Scenario_00111	What in the world is this?
ACR_1_Scenario_00112	Is this...for sale?
ACR_1_Scenario_00114	Huh?
ACR_1_Scenario_00116	This was under one of those\nbears. Is it for sale?
ACR_1_Scenario_00117	Huh. What was it doing there?
ACR_1_Scenario_00120	Well, you're welcome to buy it.
ACR_1_Scenario_00121	There's a mascot keychain on the shelf.
ACR_1_Scenario_00122	Thanks.
ACR_1_Scenario_00123	I already bought one of these.\nI don't need another.
ACR_1_Scenario_00229	The photo I just took...
ACR_1_Scenario_00228	I wonder how it turned out.
ACR_1_Scenario_00125	Is this the security device?
ACR_1_Scenario_00132	Dan?
ACR_1_Scenario_00133	Oh, got it.
ACR_1_Scenario_00134	I see now.
ACR_1_Scenario_00135	Sorry, Ashley... Can this wait?
ACR_1_Scenario_00136	Uh, sure...
ACR_1_Scenario_00137	It's gone. There's nothing we\ncan do.
ACR_1_Scenario_00138	Can we look around your\nhouse again?
ACR_1_Scenario_00139	I already told you, I've looked\nthere! Like, a bunch!
ACR_1_Scenario_00140	Elizabeth...
ACR_1_Scenario_00141	I wonder if they're here to camp.
ACR_1_Scenario_00253	Sounds like something bad\nhappened.
ACR_1_Scenario_00254	Oh well. I should get to\nthe campsite.
ACR_1_Scenario_00142	Ashley!
ACR_1_Scenario_00143	That road leads to the lake.
ACR_1_Scenario_00144	Take this road if you're going to\nthe campsite.
ACR_1_Scenario_00145	Got it. Thanks, Dan.
ACR_1_Scenario_00146	Dad...
ACR_1_Scenario_00147	We'll have things ready soon, so\njust hang out for a bit. OK?
ACR_1_Scenario_00148	Consequently, in order to fully\nunderstand the biological\nmechanisms responsible for\nretaining memories...
ACR_1_Scenario_00149	It's necessary to enhance\nsynaptic transmission\nbetween neurons. Yes?
ACR_1_Scenario_00150	Exactly! That's the most\neffective method.
ACR_1_Scenario_00151	But how exactly do you intend to\nchange the properties of\nindividual synapses?
ACR_1_Scenario_00152	Well, the functionality stored in\nthe neural network has...
ACR_1_Scenario_00256	I can't just go and introduce\nmyself to some total strangers.
ACR_1_Scenario_00160	Dad said to wait, but...
ACR_1_Scenario_00161	Maybe I'll go see what everyone's\ntalking about.
ACR_1_Scenario_00258	Dad said to wait, but I don't\nknow anyone here.
ACR_1_Scenario_00259	Maybe I should just go talk\nto Dad.
ACR_1_Scenario_00162	Thanks, Ashley.
ACR_1_Scenario_00273	I should go get the charcoal.
ACR_1_Scenario_00163	This isn't the way to\nthe guesthouse.
ACR_1_Scenario_00260	I need to get the charcoal. I\nshould go to the guesthouse.
ACR_1_Scenario_00164	I need to get the charcoal from\nthe guesthouse.
ACR_1_Scenario_00265	I heard something behind the\ndoor. How can I see inside?
ACR_1_Scenario_00165	I wonder what made that noise.
ACR_1_Scenario_00166	I can't just leave that kid.
ACR_1_Scenario_00267	Not the best time for this.
ACR_1_Scenario_00268	I can't just leave that kid.
ACR_1_Scenario_00269	Not the best time for this.
ACR_1_Scenario_00270	I can't just leave that kid.
ACR_1_Scenario_00167	This door's open...
ACR_1_Scenario_00168	I guess that's how he got out.
ACR_1_Scenario_00169	These must be his footprints.
ACR_1_Scenario_00272	I've gotta chase after that kid!
ACR_1_Scenario_00261	There!
ACR_1_Scenario_00262	I can't let him get away!
ACR_1_Scenario_00172	Have a nice walk back.
ACR_1_Scenario_00173	And try not to sneak into any\nmore off-limit spaces while\nyou're at it, OK?
ACR_1_Scenario_00263	I should hurry this back to\nthe campsite.
ACR_1_Scenario_00174	I need to take the charcoal back\nto the campsite.
ACR_1_Scenario_00175	I need to take the charcoal back\nto the campsite.
ACR_1_Scenario_00176	I need to take the charcoal back\nto the campsite.
ACR_1_Scenario_00181	The gate is installed with a card-reader\nsecurity device.
ACR_1_Scenario_00241	Is this the gate's lock?
ACR_1_Scenario_00242	I need a key card.
ACR_1_Scenario_00243	Excuse me...
ACR_1_Scenario_00244	Having trouble finding it?
ACR_1_Scenario_00245	The guesthouse is the white\nbuilding, just over there.
ACR_1_Scenario_00246	Thanks. I'll head over.
ACR_1_Scenario_00191	There's a strangely colored stone.
ACR_1_Scenario_00251	What a weird rock.
ACR_1_Scenario_00252	If you think it's weird now, try\ntaking a picture of it.
ACR_1_Scenario_00203	It unlocked!
ACR_1_Scenario_00264	So that's what the RAS can do?
ACR_1_Scenario_00204	Nice. So now...
ACR_1_Scenario_00205	The door is locked and won't open.
ACR_1_Scenario_00206	Still no good.
ACR_1_01094	Dad and I left Blood Edward Island together.
ACR_1_01095	Two years have passed since then.
ACR_1_01097	I had just turned 14 at the time.
ACR_1_01098	I was so happy to get to live with Dad.
ACR_1_01099	But it didn't turn out to be so simple.
ACR_1_01100	Dad bailed as soon as I started high school.
ACR_1_01101	He went to work as a scientist\nat this place called J.C. Valley.
ACR_1_01102	"I'll come home on the weekends."
ACR_1_01103	That's what he said right before\nleaving for Lake Juliet...
ACR_1_01104	But eventually, he stopped coming home.
ACR_1_01105	Now I haven't seen him in six months.
ACR_1_01106	Three Days Ago
ACR_1_01107	"Come to Lake Juliet for a camping trip."
ACR_1_01108	It was so sudden... Like, I have a life too,\nright? I already have my own plans.
ACR_1_01109	But...I was worried about him...
ACR_1_01110	Phew. Finally here.
ACR_1_01112	And Dad isn't.
ACR_1_01116	Oh, right...
ACR_1_01117	Jessica wanted me to check in. My phone...
ACR_1_01119	It's in my bag.
ACR_1_01121	Uh...
ACR_1_01467	(Exert Noise)
ACR_1_01124	Heeey!
ACR_1_01125	Thief!
ACR_1_01127	Give me back my bag!
ACR_1_01131	...
ACR_1_01132	I lost him...
ACR_1_01135	I knew it.
ACR_1_01136	I knew I shouldn't have come!
ACR_1_01138	This completely sucks.
ACR_1_01140	My bag's been stolen... What can\nI do?
ACR_1_01142	My whole life was in that bag.
ACR_1_01144	My wallet, my cell phone... I can't\neven get ahold of Dad now.
ACR_1_01145	My band's songbook was in there,\ntoo... And my teddy bear!
ACR_1_01146	Ugh... That kid definitely went\nthrough it by now.
ACR_1_01147	He's probably laughing at me for\ncarrying a teddy bear around.
ACR_1_01149	Ugh... Unluckiest girl in the\nworld.
ACR_1_01151	Mom's pendant!
ACR_1_01154	I'm so glad I'm wearing it.
ACR_1_01156	This pendant...
ACR_1_01157	It's all I have from Mom.
ACR_1_01160	I guess it isn't the only thing I\nhave left on me...
ACR_1_01162	The DAS Dad sent me.
ACR_1_01163	Why did he send it?
ACR_1_01164	Ugh, just looking at this thing...
ACR_1_01165	It reminds me of him. It's only\nmaking me angrier.
ACR_1_01169	You're more important to your\ndad than you realize, Ashley.
ACR_1_01170	I told him when you'll be arriving.
ACR_1_01171	He'll pick you up at the bus stop.
ACR_1_01175	Ohhh, Jessica! Dad definitely did\nnot pick me up at the bus stop!
ACR_1_01178	I'm over this. I quit!
ACR_1_01179	No way am I camping. I'm getting\non the next bus and going home!
ACR_1_01181	Oh... Wait...
ACR_1_01183	I guess I can't.
ACR_1_01184	My wallet is in my bag.
ACR_1_01185	Which means I need to see Dad if\nI want to go home!
ACR_1_01188	Ugh. OK. I'll go find Dad at the\ncampsite...
ACR_1_01189	And I'll get the money I need\nto get out of here.
ACR_1_01191	And that kid...
ACR_1_01192	If I run into him, I'm gettin' my\nbag back!
ACR_1_01194	Maybe Dad will be at\nthe campsite.
ACR_1_00161	Hello?
ACR_1_00163	There's no one here.
ACR_1_00165	What is this music?
ACR_1_00166	Does this place have its own\ntheme song or something?
ACR_1_00167	OK, this is not my jam.
ACR_1_01217	The gate's installed with a card reader.
ACR_1_01218	Looks like I need a key card or\nsomething to open it...
ACR_1_01219	But I don't have anything like\nthat on me.
ACR_1_01220	What should I do?
ACR_1_01221	Hey, you!
ACR_1_01224	Hello there!
ACR_1_01225	Um... Hello!
ACR_1_01226	Ahh, what great energy!
ACR_1_01227	Sorry to sneak up on you like\nthat. Hope I didn't startle you.
ACR_1_01228	But you look like you could use\nsome help.
ACR_1_01229	Is something wrong?
ACR_1_01230	Well, I want to get to the\ncampsite, but...
ACR_1_01232	The gate's installed with a card reader.
ACR_1_01233	Looks like I need a key card or\nsomething to open it...
ACR_1_01234	But I don't have anything like\nthat on me.
ACR_1_01235	What should I do?
ACR_1_01236	Heeey!
ACR_1_01238	It's that guy from before...
ACR_1_01240	Sorry to shout.
ACR_1_01241	Oh, it's fine.
ACR_1_00185	There. All done.
ACR_1_00189	Excuse me...
ACR_1_00190	Hm?
ACR_1_00192	Oh, hello there!
ACR_1_00194	Oh, um, hello!
ACR_1_00195	Now that's some spirit!
ACR_1_00196	What can I do for you?
ACR_1_00197	Could you point me toward the\nguesthouse?
ACR_1_00199	Of course. The guesthouse is the\nwhite building, just over there.
ACR_1_00200	Thanks!
ACR_1_00204	There. All done.
ACR_1_00206	Excuse me...
ACR_1_00207	Hm?
ACR_1_00208	Oh, hello there!
ACR_1_00209	Oh, um, hello!
ACR_1_00210	Now that's some spirit!
ACR_1_00211	What can I do for you?
ACR_1_00212	Could you point me toward the\ncampsites?
ACR_1_00213	That depends. Have you checked\nin yet?
ACR_1_00215	Then you'd better go to the\nguesthouse first.
ACR_1_00216	Someone there can give you a\nkey card to open the gate.
ACR_1_00218	The guesthouse is the white\nbuilding, just over there.
ACR_1_00219	Thanks!
ACR_1_00224	Have you stopped by the\nguesthouse?
ACR_1_00225	Yeah, but it was empty. I assumed\nit was closed today.
ACR_1_00226	That's strange. It shouldn't be.
ACR_1_00227	He must have been taking\nanother one of his breaks.
ACR_1_00228	Who?
ACR_1_00229	There's a student working at the\nguesthouse part-time.
ACR_1_00230	Not the hardest worker I've ever\nseen. Takes a lot of breaks.
ACR_1_00231	Huh. Really.
ACR_1_00232	I'm sure he'll be back soon.
ACR_1_00233	I guess I'll try again, then.
ACR_1_00234	Good plan.
ACR_1_00243	There. All done.
ACR_1_00247	Hm?
ACR_1_00248	Oh, hello there!
ACR_1_00250	Oh, um, hello!
ACR_1_00251	Now that's some spirit!
ACR_1_00252	What can I do for you?
ACR_1_00253	Can I ask you something?
ACR_1_00254	Absolutely.
ACR_1_00255	I stopped by the guesthouse,\nbut it was empty.
ACR_1_00256	Is it closed today?
ACR_1_00257	That's strange. It shouldn't be.
ACR_1_00258	He must have been taking\nanother one of his breaks.
ACR_1_00259	Who?
ACR_1_00260	There's a student working at the\nguesthouse part-time.
ACR_1_00261	Not the hardest worker I've ever\nseen. Takes a lot of breaks.
ACR_1_00262	Huh. Really.
ACR_1_00263	I'm sure he'll be back soon.
ACR_1_00264	I guess I'll try again, then.
ACR_1_00265	Good plan.
ACR_1_00271	Unluckiest girl in the world.
ACR_1_00272	First my bag's stolen, and now\nthe guesthouse is empty.
ACR_1_00273	It's just one thing after another.
ACR_1_00275	Is something wrong?
ACR_1_00277	I'm Dan Maxwell. A forest ranger.
ACR_1_00278	Oh, cool. Like a forest cop?
ACR_1_00279	Ehhh... One of my jobs is to help\nfolks in trouble.
ACR_1_00280	Call me Dan. What's your name?
ACR_1_00281	Ashley. Ashley Mizuki Robins.
ACR_1_00282	Well, hi there, Ashley. Mind\ntelling me what happened?
ACR_1_00284	Someone stole my bag.
ACR_1_00285	What? That's terrible!
ACR_1_00286	I was at the bus stop, and a boy\nsnuck up behind me.\n
ACR_1_00287	He snatched my bag and ran off.
ACR_1_00288	A boy, you say?
ACR_1_00289	I had just gotten off the bus too.\nUnluckiest girl in the world, huh?
ACR_1_00290	I see. I'm sorry that happened.
ACR_1_00293	Can you describe the stolen bag?
ACR_1_00294	Well, it's a blue backpack,\nabout this big...
ACR_1_00296	Thanks. Got it.
ACR_1_00297	I'll keep my eyes out for the boy\nand your bag when I'm on patrol.
ACR_1_00298	Thank you so much.
ACR_1_00300	Just in case, I'd like you to file a\ntheft report at the guesthouse.
ACR_1_01243	You should tell your parents\nabout it too, if you haven't yet.
ACR_1_01244	Are they here with you?
ACR_1_01245	Dad's at the campsite...\nProbably...
ACR_1_01246	That's a relief to hear.
ACR_1_01247	You must be shaken, but I hope\nyou can relax once you meet up\nwith your dad.
ACR_1_01248	If he was remotely normal, then...\nYeah, maybe.
ACR_1_01249	I bet that kid is back from\nhis break by now.
ACR_1_01250	Why don't you try the\nguesthouse again?
ACR_1_01251	Yeah, OK. Thanks for your help.
ACR_1_01252	Do you and your dad go camping\ntogether often?
ACR_1_01253	No. This will actually be my first\ntime camping with him.
ACR_1_01254	Oh, I see! You must be pretty\nexcited then, huh?
ACR_1_00325	Oh, yeah... Very excited.
ACR_1_00326	That's great! I'll admit, I kind of\nenvy your dad.
ACR_1_00327	Why?
ACR_1_00328	It's great that you're excited!\nMy daughter is only five, but...
ACR_1_00329	I hope she'll be excited to go\ncamping with me one day.
ACR_1_00330	Let me ask you something...
ACR_1_00331	Do all dads want to camp with\ntheir kids?
ACR_1_00332	Oh, I'm sure we do. We want our\nkids to see they can rely on us.
ACR_1_00335	Yeah. Kinda...
ACR_1_00337	Not so much, huh?
ACR_1_00338	No, not really.
ACR_1_00339	My dad asked me last minute. I\nalready had plans with friends.
ACR_1_00340	Well, you came all the way here.\nWhy not try to enjoy it?
ACR_1_00343	You're right, I know...
ACR_1_00344	But if Jessica hadn't talked me\ninto coming here...
ACR_1_00345	Who's Jessica?
ACR_1_00346	She's my aunt. But she raised me,\nso she's basically my mom.
ACR_1_00347	She really gets me.
ACR_1_00348	If Jessica were here, I bet she'd\ntell you to make the most of this.
ACR_1_00349	Your friends will wait for you.\nJust have fun with your dad.
ACR_1_00353	Take some time to enjoy the\nbeauty of Lake Juliet.
ACR_1_00354	It may lack arcades or theaters,\nbut you'll find plenty to do.
ACR_1_00355	I sure hope so.
ACR_1_01257	Just be sure to find plenty to do\nafter you've checked in.
ACR_1_01258	If the guesthouse still looks\nempty, well...
ACR_1_01259	Just sit back and enjoy the <color=#00994CFF>tunes\nplaying over the speakers</color>.
ACR_1_01260	Huh, uh... Yeah.
ACR_1_00356	Just promise me one thing.\nWhen you go to leave...
ACR_1_00357	I should take all my garbage\nwith me, right?
ACR_1_00359	Bingo!
ACR_1_00360	I wish every camper had\nyour manners.
ACR_1_00361	Unfortunately, it doesn't always\nwork out like that.
ACR_1_00362	Instead, us <color=#00994CFF>forest rangers</color> get\nstuck on cleanup duty.
ACR_1_00368	About that song playing in the\nguesthouse...
ACR_1_00370	♪Dat-da-dah dat da-da daah,\ndah dat da-daaah...♪
ACR_1_00371	Yeah, that's the one.
ACR_1_00372	It's so catchy.
ACR_1_00373	It really is. The student working\nthere said the same thing.
ACR_1_00374	A local wrote it. He's pretty\neccentric... He runs the diner.
ACR_1_00375	The owner of the guesthouse\nliked it, so here we are.
ACR_1_00376	Huh. So that's how it ended up \non repeat?
ACR_1_00377	That's right. I quite like it, myself.
ACR_1_00378	But the attendant sure isn't a\nfan of it...
ACR_1_00379	He's always blasting music on his\nheadphones to drown it out.
ACR_1_00383	What all does a forest\nranger do?
ACR_1_00384	Our job is to protect the forest\nand nature. 
ACR_1_00385	Sometimes we arrest poachers\nor folks who cut down trees.
ACR_1_00386	I've never met a forest\nranger before.
ACR_1_00387	That's not uncommon for\ncity kids.
ACR_1_00388	Most only see rangers on TV.
ACR_1_00392	I bet that kid is back from\nhis break by now.
ACR_1_00393	Why don't you try the\nguesthouse again?
ACR_1_00394	Yeah, OK. Thanks for your help.
ACR_1_01261	♪Oh, Lake Juliet! Doot-doot-dee-doo\nDoot-doot-dee-doo, Lake Juliet and you♪
ACR_1_00399	Aah! Too much!
ACR_1_00401	Whoa! Cut it out!
ACR_1_00403	Huh?
ACR_1_00407	Oh.
ACR_1_00408	Uh.
ACR_1_00409	H-hey! Hands off the dial!
ACR_1_00410	It was an accident!
ACR_1_00413	Are you, like, a customer?
ACR_1_00415	I've been asking for help, but you\nmust not have heard me.
ACR_1_00416	Oh, uh, sorry.
ACR_1_00418	What were you doing back there?
ACR_1_00419	Writing my music.
ACR_1_00420	Really? You were writing a song?
ACR_1_00421	Yeah. I was on my break.
ACR_1_00423	But now we got a customer, so\nbreak time's over, I guess.
ACR_1_00427	Hello there. Welcome to\nLake Juliet.
ACR_1_00428	Back on the clock now, huh?
ACR_1_00429	I'm Tommy Harrison. Guesthouse\nchief of staff.
ACR_1_00430	Chief? I heard you worked here\npart time.
ACR_1_00431	Where'd you hear that?
ACR_1_00432	Dan the forest ranger told me\nabout you.
ACR_1_00433	Said you're a bit of a slacker...\nImplied you take a lot of naps.
ACR_1_00434	Aw man, he really said that? It's\nthat song! Whenever I hear it, I—
ACR_1_00435	Nah, I get it. I heard it. Once\nis enough.
ACR_1_00436	Right? You understand.
ACR_1_00437	It's such an earworm. Makes it so\nhard to <color=#00994CFF>write my own music</color>.
ACR_1_00439	So what can I do for you?
ACR_1_00440	I'd like to check in for\nthe campsite.
ACR_1_00441	Okey doke, just a sec.
ACR_1_00448	Just take this form...
ACR_1_00449	and sign your name.
ACR_1_00451	Ashley Mizuki Robins...
ACR_1_00453	Ashley?
ACR_1_00454	Oh, you must be Dr. Robins's\ndaughter.
ACR_1_00455	He said you were coming. He\nasked me to help you out.
ACR_1_00457	He asked you to help me instead\nof coming himself? Typical.
ACR_1_00463	Here you go. Use this key card to\nget around.
ACR_1_00464	We keep the entrance gate\nlocked...
ACR_1_00465	But this will get you through.
ACR_1_00469	Do you have any bags?
ACR_1_00470	Or do you just like to\ntravel light?
ACR_1_00471	I had a bag, but some kid stole it.
ACR_1_00472	Are you serious? Kids these days.
ACR_1_00473	Oh, right. Dan told me I should\nfile a theft report here.
ACR_1_00474	Can I do that now?
ACR_1_00475	Sure thing.
ACR_1_00477	Here's the form.
ACR_1_00478	Fill it out, and I'll give it to\nthe police.
ACR_1_00480	There. Done.
ACR_1_00482	Looks good.
ACR_1_00483	I'll take it from here.
ACR_1_00484	Thanks, Tommy.
ACR_1_00485	Man, there's been a lot of <color=#00994CFF>weird\nstuff</color> going on lately.
ACR_1_00491	Earlier you said you were\nwriting a song...
ACR_1_00492	Yeah.
ACR_1_00493	I write the songs for my band.
ACR_1_00494	Cool.
ACR_1_00496	First I come up with the melody \nand the chord progression.
ACR_1_00497	And then we work on the song\ntogether as a band.
ACR_1_00498	Wow, that's pretty awesome.
ACR_1_00499	I could talk your ear off about\nthis stuff all day. When I get\ngoing about music, it's hard\nto stop.
ACR_1_00500	My boss says I should put the\nsame effort into my work.
ACR_1_00505	What other weird stuff has been\ngoing on around here?
ACR_1_00506	Nothing all that major... Just\nodd little things.
ACR_1_00507	Like, three days ago some food\nwent missing from storage.
ACR_1_00508	Then today your bag got stolen.
ACR_1_00510	Not to mention this shady guy in\na black suit checking in alone.
ACR_1_00512	That guy did not look ready\nto camp.
ACR_1_00513	Hope he's not here to cause\nany trouble.
ACR_1_00514	Is this place dangerous?
ACR_1_00515	Nah, not really. It's just a quiet\nlittle town.
ACR_1_00516	I've worked here for three years\nwith no problems.
ACR_1_00517	You've been doing this a\nlong time.
ACR_1_00518	I'm buds with the owner. Lets me\nwork between college semesters.
ACR_1_00519	But I'm graduating this year, so\nthis is my last season.
ACR_1_00523	OK. You're good to go.
ACR_1_00524	Enjoy Lake Juliet.
ACR_1_00525	Thanks.
ACR_1_00526	Oh yeah.
ACR_1_00527	This is your first time here,\nright?
ACR_1_00528	Yep.
ACR_1_00529	Then you should check out\nthe shop.
ACR_1_00530	We've got refreshments, some\nsouvenirs, a rock from the mine.
ACR_1_00531	A rock?
ACR_1_00532	It's cooler than it sounds. Take\na picture and you'll see.
ACR_1_00533	Oh, and there's a sale. All the\nstuff on that shelf is five bucks.
ACR_1_00534	Nice. Too bad I don't have any\nmoney on me...
ACR_1_00535	No worries. You don't need cash.\nJust use the card I gave you.
ACR_1_00536	You can use it to shop?
ACR_1_00537	Yep. The card keeps track, and\nyou'll settle your bill at checkout.
ACR_1_00538	I bet yours'll be paid for by your—
ACR_1_00539	My dad?
ACR_1_00541	I might have to do some\nshopping, then.
ACR_1_00545	Phone's ringing. Can you hold\non a minute?
ACR_1_00546	Hello?
ACR_1_00547	Hey, it's me.
ACR_1_00548	What's up?
ACR_1_00549	Listen, can you...
ACR_1_00550	Not now. I'm on the clock.
ACR_1_00551	Come on. Just for a while...
ACR_1_00552	OK, OK. I'll swing by later if\nI have time.
ACR_1_00553	A friend of mine is asking me to\nhang out at the campsite.
ACR_1_00554	Same place you're staying.
ACR_1_00555	Are you going?
ACR_1_00556	Maybe.
ACR_1_00557	Oh, cool.
ACR_1_00560	You probably need to know\nwhere you're going.
ACR_1_00561	Just go through the gate, and\ntake a right at the fork.
ACR_1_00562	Through the gate, then right.\nGot it.
ACR_1_00563	And that's it. Have fun!
ACR_1_00564	Yeah.
ACR_1_00567	You probably need to know\nwhere you're going.
ACR_1_00568	Just go through the gate, and\ntake a right at the fork.
ACR_1_00569	Through the gate, then right.\nGot it.
ACR_1_00570	One more thing.
ACR_1_00572	Here's a brochure.
ACR_1_00573	It's got a map of the area.\nCould come in handy.
ACR_1_00574	And that's it. Have fun!
ACR_1_00575	Yeah.
ACR_1_00579	Pretty cool, right? The color\nchanges in pictures.
ACR_1_00580	Wow. I've never seen anything\nlike that.
ACR_1_00581	They used to mine these rocks\nin the area.
ACR_1_00586	I tried that earlier.
ACR_1_00587	I've never seen a rock\nlike that.
ACR_1_00588	They used to mine them\nin the area.
ACR_1_00597	There's writing on the side...
ACR_1_00598	"Only accepts tokens issued by\nthe can recycler."
ACR_1_00599	Tokens?
ACR_1_00600	Yeah, there's this thing at the\ncampsite that recycles cans.
ACR_1_00601	It gives you these special tokens\nwhen you toss an empty one in.
ACR_1_01265	Huh?
ACR_1_01266	Ah!
ACR_1_01267	Huh...
ACR_1_01268	That memory of Mom just...came\nout of nowhere... I wonder why.
ACR_1_01269	I guess there are people around.
ACR_1_01462	(Exert Noise)
ACR_1_01271	Whoa... So many people.
ACR_1_01272	Pass me the veggies and I'll cut them.
ACR_1_01273	Is this good?
ACR_1_01463	(Exert Noise)
ACR_1_01274	This, Richard?
ACR_1_01275	Yeah, that's it. Put it over there, will you?
ACR_1_01277	Dad.
ACR_1_01280	Ashley!
ACR_1_01464	(Exert Noise)
ACR_1_01282	Over here!
ACR_1_01465	(Exert Noise)
ACR_1_00653	You totally forgot to pick me up.
ACR_1_01284	Huh?
ACR_1_01286	Don't forget to pick up your\ndaughter, Richard.
ACR_1_01288	Oh, shoot!
ACR_1_01466	...
ACR_1_00674	What's wrong? Not feeling well?
ACR_1_00675	Are you...tired from the bus ride?
ACR_1_00676	No.
ACR_1_00677	Isn't it obvious?
ACR_1_00678	Oh, of course.
ACR_1_00679	If your tummy hurts, the\nbathroom's right over there.
ACR_1_00680	That's not it!
ACR_1_00681	Dad, look at me. Can't you tell\nI'm missing something?
ACR_1_00682	Oh, you forgot your bag!
ACR_1_00683	No! I didn't forget anything!
ACR_1_00684	Someone stole my bag as soon as\nI got off the bus!
ACR_1_00685	Wh-what?
ACR_1_00686	Was the DAS in the bag?
ACR_1_00687	No. I keep it in my pouch.
ACR_1_00688	Oh, good. I'm glad it's safe.
ACR_1_00691	You're glad the DAS is safe...
ACR_1_00692	but it's fine that I lost literally\neverything else.
ACR_1_00693	No, I mean...
ACR_1_00694	I filed a theft report.
ACR_1_00695	That's the right way to handle it.\nWell done.
ACR_1_00696	I think I was about your age when\nI filed my first theft report...
ACR_1_00697	Are you serious right now?
ACR_1_00698	Oh, um.
ACR_1_00699	Grrr...
ACR_1_00700	Uh, um... Oh!
ACR_1_00701	Let me introduce you to\neveryone!
ACR_1_01291	Ugh.
ACR_1_01292	He's avoiding a fight.
ACR_1_00702	Ashley, come on over.
ACR_1_01294	Over there is Rex, the director.\nThat's Sofia next to him.
ACR_1_01295	Beside her is Gina and Ian.
ACR_1_01296	And that leaves— Hmm...
ACR_1_01297	Rex's daughter Elizabeth and her\nfriend Janet, but...
ACR_1_01298	I could have sworn they were\nhere a minute ago.
ACR_1_01299	No way I'm gonna remember\nall this.
ACR_1_01302	Oh, I've gotta prep the grill.
ACR_1_01303	Whoa, hold on a sec. What am I\nsupposed to do?
ACR_1_01304	Go say hi! Everyone's really nice.
ACR_1_01305	Are you kidding me?
ACR_1_00728	Sofia, about the matter we\ndiscussed...
ACR_1_00729	Yes, that... I need more time.
ACR_1_00730	Don't you think it's time to move\nforward?
ACR_1_00731	Don't be so hasty. You want the\nbest shot at success, don't you?
ACR_1_00732	Well, of course. It's just...
ACR_1_01306	Dad, come with me. I don't want\nto meet them all by myself...
ACR_1_00737	Has anyone seen it?
ACR_1_00738	That's strange. It should've been\ndelivered by now.
ACR_1_00739	But I can't find it anywhere.
ACR_1_00740	Hellooo! Dad! Are you even\nlistening to me?
ACR_1_00745	This is no good... We can't start\nthe cookout without it.
ACR_1_00746	I can't do this.
ACR_1_00747	What to do, what to do...
ACR_1_00748	Ugh...
ACR_1_00749	Huh? What's the matter?
ACR_1_00750	Can you give me money for the\nbus fare home?
ACR_1_00751	Jessica said I could ask you.
ACR_1_00752	Of course. I'll buy your ticket\nwhen you leave.
ACR_1_00753	Can you give me the cash now?\nI need to go home.
ACR_1_00754	What? Why?
ACR_1_00755	I was looking forward to\nspending time <color=#00994CFF>with you</color>.
ACR_1_01311	With me? Really?
ACR_1_01312	Yeah, don't you want to at least\nhave a cookout? It's fun.
ACR_1_01313	There's nothing fun about a\ncookout with total strangers!
ACR_1_01314	I could be at home practicing\nguitar or something, but instead\nI'm at some lame cookout.
ACR_1_01315	You play guitar?
ACR_1_01316	Yes, I'm in a band. With friends,\nwho I know.
ACR_1_01317	I had no idea.
ACR_1_01318	Oh, surprising! You know nothing\nabout me.
ACR_1_01319	I have interests that are just\nas important to me as your\nresearch is to you.
ACR_1_01320	My music is the most important\nthing in my life right now.
ACR_1_01321	Ashley...
ACR_1_01322	I'm for real, you know. My band is\ngoing to get signed one day.
ACR_1_01323	Why haven't you told me about\nall this before?
ACR_1_01324	I've wanted to, but you're\nnever home.
ACR_1_01326	I'm just no good as a dad, huh?
ACR_1_01327	I don't know the first thing\nabout you.
ACR_1_01328	I feel the same about you.
ACR_1_01329	Why did you invite me to come\ncamping, of all things?
ACR_1_01330	Ashley, I asked you to come\nhere because...
ACR_1_01331	Because I wanted to show you\nLake Juliet one more time.
ACR_1_01332	What?
ACR_1_01333	You must not remember.
ACR_1_01334	Your mother brought you here\nonce, when you were little.
ACR_1_01335	Mom brought me here?
ACR_1_01336	She did...
ACR_1_01337	This place was special to us.
ACR_1_01338	It's where I proposed to her.
ACR_1_01339	I had no idea.
ACR_1_01340	As for why I took a job here,\nat J.C. Valley...
ACR_1_01341	It's because of Judd Fitzgerald.
ACR_1_01343	He's the founder of the lab...
ACR_1_01344	And he was your mother's mentor\nwhen she first started her\nresearch into memory.
ACR_1_01345	So, I...
ACR_1_01346	I decided to work here because\nof the connection to her.
ACR_1_01347	Dad...
ACR_1_00801	Kind of a low blow, Dad...
ACR_1_00802	What am I supposed to say when\nyou bring up Mom like that?
ACR_1_00807	That must be why...
ACR_1_00808	Why what?
ACR_1_00809	I might remember a few things\nabout my trip here with Mom.
ACR_1_00810	Really?
ACR_1_00811	I remembered walking with\nher when I saw the gate.
ACR_1_00812	Impressive. That was 13\nyears ago.
ACR_1_00813	Well, I only remembered a little.
ACR_1_00814	Will you tell me if you remember\nanything else?
ACR_1_00815	Yeah, sure.
ACR_1_00816	I want to know why your mother\ncame to this place...
ACR_1_00817	And why she brought you.
ACR_1_00818	She came here without\ntelling you?
ACR_1_00819	She did.
ACR_1_00820	I need to find out why she\nwas here.
ACR_1_00821	Because if I do, I think it\nwill reveal...
ACR_1_00822	the truth behind her death.
ACR_1_01349	This is the first time in two years\nI've talked to Dad about Mom.
ACR_1_01350	I haven't seen him look so serious\nin forever...
ACR_1_01352	There's something I want you\nto have.
ACR_1_01355	What is it?
ACR_1_01356	Your mother left it at J.C. Valley.
ACR_1_01357	This was Mom's bracelet?
ACR_1_01358	Yeah. So I want you to hang\non to it.
ACR_1_01360	Huh?
ACR_1_01362	R...A...S?
ACR_1_01364	Whoa, hang on. What is\nthis thing?
ACR_1_01365	Huh? Does it have some sort of\nbiometric authentication system?
ACR_1_01366	Could she have configured this\nfor Ashley?
ACR_1_01368	What the...
ACR_1_01369	I can't take it off!
ACR_1_01370	What? Let me see.
ACR_1_01373	It's completely locked... But why?
ACR_1_01372	We won't be able to remove\nit here.
ACR_1_00883	Dr. Robins!
ACR_1_01374	What is it, Gina?
ACR_1_00884	We can't find the charcoal.
ACR_1_00885	Oh, right!
ACR_1_00886	Everyone's waiting, Doctor.\nWe're ready to eat.
ACR_1_00887	Right, about that... Tommy hasn't\ndelivered it yet.
ACR_1_00888	I guess I'll have to go pick it up.
ACR_1_00889	Guesthouse Tommy? Bet he's\nslacking off again.
ACR_1_00891	He probably forgot all about it.
ACR_1_00892	I'll go get the charcoal.
ACR_1_00893	Are you sure?
ACR_1_00894	I'm the reliable one, remember?\nIt's fine. Go be with your friends.
ACR_1_00896	I'll be right back.
ACR_1_00897	Well... OK.
ACR_1_00901	Tommy, missing in action again.
ACR_1_00902	*rattle*
ACR_1_00903	Maybe he's in the back.
ACR_1_00904	*bark*
ACR_1_00905	Was that a dog?
ACR_1_00906	*rattle* *rattle*
ACR_1_00907	There it is again!
ACR_1_00910	Back here?
ACR_1_00913	What are you doing?!
ACR_1_00915	Hey!
ACR_1_00916	Ah!
ACR_1_00918	You're the kid who stole my bag!
ACR_1_00921	Locked.
ACR_1_00923	The RAS lit up...
ACR_1_00924	What's it doing?
ACR_1_00925	Aaah! Oh, uh...
ACR_1_00926	It's coming from the DAS...
ACR_1_01384	The RAS is responding to this\ndevice. There was some noise...
ACR_1_01385	and then the DAS responded.
ACR_1_01390	Empty.
ACR_1_01391	Where'd he go?
ACR_1_00932	Footprints!
ACR_1_00933	Must be the kid's.
ACR_1_00936	Ugh! Ugggh!
ACR_1_00938	Made it!
ACR_1_00944	Hey, wait!
ACR_1_00946	I think I can fit through this gap...
ACR_1_00951	I should be able to get through\nhere too.
ACR_1_00953	Huh?
ACR_1_00955	It's a watch. Did the kid drop it?
ACR_1_00957	"To my dear son, Matthew."
ACR_1_00958	Matthew?
ACR_1_00962	Ashley! What are you doing\nout here?
ACR_1_00963	Tommy!
ACR_1_00966	Just trying to get through the\nhole in the fence.
ACR_1_00969	Wait, no way...
ACR_1_01393	What?
ACR_1_01394	Did you break into the\nstorage room?
ACR_1_01395	What?! OK, hang on!
ACR_1_00970	Just tell me how you got in there.
ACR_1_00971	I-I...
ACR_1_00972	The door was locked.
ACR_1_00974	I shouldn't admit to opening the\ndoor myself...
ACR_1_00975	It was, um, open when I got here.
ACR_1_00976	Ashley. Seriously.
ACR_1_00977	It was! Honest!
ACR_1_00978	We didn't get the charcoal\ndelivery, so I came to pick it up.
ACR_1_00979	I was waiting for you when I\nheard a sound from the back.
ACR_1_00980	I went inside and saw the back\ndoor open...
ACR_1_00981	Someone's been eating the\ninventory. Was it you?
ACR_1_00982	Excuse you! I'm no thief!
ACR_1_00983	Then who was it?
ACR_1_00984	Probably the boy who escaped\nthrough that fence.
ACR_1_00985	What boy?
ACR_1_00986	Where is he?
ACR_1_00987	He ran off.
ACR_1_00988	Sure he did.
ACR_1_00989	Do you have any proof?
ACR_1_00993	So you finally believe I'm\ninnocent in all this?
ACR_1_00994	Yeah, OK. I should have listened\nto you.
ACR_1_00995	Phew... I'm glad you get it.
ACR_1_00996	How do you think the kid got in?
ACR_1_00997	The door was definitely locked...
ACR_1_00998	Can I just get that charcoal?
ACR_1_00999	My dad sent me for it.
ACR_1_01000	Oh, yeah! I totally forgot.
ACR_1_01001	Called it.
ACR_1_01002	I can take it over. Everyone's\nwaiting.
ACR_1_01003	That'd be great. Thanks.
ACR_1_01004	I'll grab it. Go ahead and wait by\nthe counter.
ACR_1_01008	Is that everything?
ACR_1_01009	Yep, as ordered. One bag of\ncharcoal.
ACR_1_01010	Need any help?
ACR_1_01011	I've got it.
ACR_1_01012	I'll let you get back to work.
ACR_1_01013	Break time's over, I guess.
ACR_1_01014	I know it'll be hard, but really try.
ACR_1_01015	Hey now!
ACR_1_01016	Later, Tommy.
ACR_1_01019	Ashley, wait up.
ACR_1_01020	Yeah?
ACR_1_01021	I really should be the one to\ndrop it off. Let me grab it.
ACR_1_01022	I also want to apologize to\nDr. Robins for the trouble.
ACR_1_01023	Sure... Thanks.
ACR_1_01024	I'll carry it. Let's go.
ACR_1_01025	OK!
ACR_1_01030	Daaad! I got the charcoal!
ACR_1_01031	Where is he?
ACR_1_01399	Ashley, right?
ACR_1_01400	I'm Ian Tyler, a colleague of\nDr. Robins.
ACR_1_01033	He asked me to give you\na message.
ACR_1_01034	He had to go deal with an\nemergency at J.C. Valley.
ACR_1_01035	I offered to go instead, since\nyou're here and all, but...
ACR_1_01036	He said it had to be him.
ACR_1_01037	Seriously?!
ACR_1_01038	I have to say, Dr. Robins is very\ndedicated.
ACR_1_01039	He was so focused on\npreparing for this trip,\nhe skipped breakfast.
ACR_1_01040	And now he'll miss lunch because\nhe's run off to fix some new\nproblem!
ACR_1_01041	I've never met anyone so willing\nto drop everything and rush off\nto the lab.
ACR_1_01043	His dedication aside, who could\nwalk away from a feast like this?
ACR_1_01044	He must be perpetually hungry.
ACR_1_01402	Hi, Ashley. I'm Gina Barnes.
ACR_1_01045	Dr. Robins said you're welcome\nto his share.
ACR_1_01046	So let's have a good time.
ACR_1_01048	OK.
ACR_1_01404	I'll leave the charcoal here.
ACR_1_01405	Thanks.
ACR_1_01406	Tommy! Over here!
ACR_1_01407	Yo!
ACR_1_01408	It's those girls...
ACR_1_01410	So, about the band contest...
ACR_1_01412	Contest?
ACR_1_01414	We still haven't found the\nmusic player.
ACR_1_01415	Seriously? What are we\ngonna do?
ACR_1_01416	We'll re-record it. Change it up\nwith a new song, maybe.
ACR_1_01417	That'll never work. That was our\nbest performance by far!
ACR_1_01418	Well, we can't just throw away\nour chance!
ACR_1_01419	Hmph.
ACR_1_01421	So those two are in\nTommy's band...
ACR_1_01422	Your food is ready, Sofia.
ACR_1_01423	Oh, I'm all right. I already ate.
ACR_1_01424	I'll take it, Director.
ACR_1_01425	Ian, grab the salt?
ACR_1_01428	Ugh... So boring.
ACR_1_01429	If I knew it would be like this...
ACR_1_01430	I would have gone to band practice instead.
ACR_1_01431	*sigh*
ACR_1_01435	Hello.
ACR_1_01436	Ah!
ACR_1_01437	You must be Ashley.
ACR_1_01438	Uh-huh...
ACR_1_01439	Pleasure to meet you.
ACR_1_01440	My name is Ryan Gray. I work\nwith Dr. Robins.
ACR_1_01441	Do you have time to chat?
ACR_1_01468	(Exert Noise)
ACR_1_01444	This guy...
ACR_1_01445	Have I...met him somewhere before?
ACR_1_01449	Uh, Tommy? I got this.
ACR_1_01450	Whoa, the winning gumball!
ACR_1_01451	Well done!
ACR_1_01452	Oh, thanks...
ACR_1_01453	Hang on, I'll get you the prize.
ACR_1_01455	Ta-da! Here it is!
ACR_1_01457	Thanks!
ACR_1_01458	I can, like...eat this gumball\nnow, right?
ACR_1_01459	Uh... Be my guest.
ACR_1_01460	Cool.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00004	This must be where the music's\ncoming from.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00008	Someone's there.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00096	Must be the part-timer.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00009	Excuse me! Hello?
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00010	Guess he can't hear me.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00012	The backroom is visible through the blinds.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00013	His back is turned... He doesn't\neven know I'm here.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00014	He's wearing headphones so he\ncan't hear me, either.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00015	Hey! You have a customer!\nNotice me already!
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00017	I have to get his attention.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00097	Hmm... What's that?
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00019	There's a speaker.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00098	I wonder what that cord is\nconnected to.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00021	I wonder what that cord is\nconnected to.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00023	It looks just like the one in\nthe shop.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00099	The red cord is connected to the\nspeaker in the shop.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00024	The speaker in the storage room\nis connected to a yellow cord.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00026	There's all sorts of stuff back\nhere... Must be a storage room.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00027	The shelves contain the shop's inventory.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00029	This fridge is so big. I wonder\nwhat's inside...
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00030	There's a big refrigerator.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00100	Hmm... This is a little concerning.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00101	What can I do to get\nhis attention?
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00032	Someone's in the\nbackroom, right?
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00033	Uh... Hellooo?
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00034	Ugh. I just can't get\ntheir attention.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00037	Doesn't even notice\nme knocking.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00039	The music is coming out of\nthis speaker.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00041	Is the music playing in the\nstorage room too?
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00043	I bet this music will play from the\nspeaker in the storage room...
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00045	One of these cords goes under\nthe door.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00046	There are red and yellow cords on the ground.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00063	This is what's playing the\nmusic, right?
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00065	The yellow cord has fallen out\nof the stereo.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00066	Maybe that's why it's not putting\nany sound out.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00102	Let's take a look at the back of\nthe stereo.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00068	It probably isn't working because\nit's unplugged.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00069	I'll have a little look around.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00070	I could plug it in here.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00071	I'll just stick it in here...
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00072	Doesn't seem like anything's\nresponding... Must not be it.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00103	I wonder which jack I need to\nplug in...
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00073	I'll just stick it in here...
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00074	That should get the music playing\nin the storage room.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00076	Can't he hear anything? He's\nnot coming out...
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00077	I'll just stick it in here...
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00078	Doesn't seem like anything's\nresponding... Must not be it.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00104	I wonder which jack I need to\nplug in...
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00079	It didn't work when I connected\nit to this.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00081	He still hasn't noticed me.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00082	The volume must be too low.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00084	He'll never notice like this.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00086	OK, the music's playing.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00087	So what'll happen if I turn up\nthe volume?
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00089	No way he won't realize there's\nsomeone out here, right?
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00090	Ugh, he's still not coming out...\nThe volume must be too low.
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00092	Is it too quiet?
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00093	What should I do?
ACR_Mystery_1_1_00094	There's a stereo on the counter.
ACR_Mystery_1_2_00009	What are these symbols?
ACR_Mystery_1_2_00010	Maybe if I press the button\non the DAS...
ACR_Mystery_1_2_00011	I'll try again.
ACR_Mystery_1_2_00012	This is tougher than I thought...
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00002	Hey, it wasn't me!
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00003	OK, then. Prove that it\nwasn't you.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00008	Have you seen this?
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00009	What is it?
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00010	This paper plate and the water.\nThe dog was drinking from it.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00011	Actually, I put that there.\nLeaky roof.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00012	Seriously?
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00014	I'd better find some\nbetter evidence.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00016	Take a look at this.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00017	What is it?
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00018	It's a footprint. Totally different\nfrom my shoes.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00019	And there are paw prints too.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00020	Huh. How could that\nhave happened?
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00022	Well, this alone isn't enough to\nprove your innocence.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00024	I better find some\nmore evidence.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00025	I can probably find something\noutside. Let's take a look.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00027	You can go out the back door,\nbut don't get any ideas about\ntrying to run off.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00032	I can probably find\nsomething outside.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00036	Whoa, hold up. You can go out,\nbut only through the back door.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00122	Proof, huh? I wonder how much\nconvincing Tommy needs...
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00123	Let's see, proof... Would one\nmore thing be enough to\nconvince Tommy?
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00039	This might work.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00040	But how can I show it to Tommy?
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00043	But to show Tommy these\nfootprints...
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00046	OK, I took a photo of\nthe footprints.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00047	Tommy will have to believe me\nonce he sees this.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00048	Fresh footprints were left behind.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00049	You've already taken a photo of this.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00050	Fresh footprints were left behind.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00051	Tommy, check this out.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00052	Got some proof for me?
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00053	I found these footprints from a\nkid and a dog out back.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00054	They were left by the kid!
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00058	No way, really?
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00059	Check it out. I took this photo of\nwhat I found back there.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00060	The kid who left these\nfootprints is the one who\nraided the storage.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00063	No way, really?
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00064	Check out this other photo!
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00065	Another one?
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00066	Hold on, I already saw this.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00067	It isn't proving anything.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00068	Aww.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00127	Check this out, Tommy.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00128	A watch? So what?
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00129	I think that kid dropped it.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00130	How do I know it isn't yours?
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00131	Oh, come on!
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00132	That doesn't prove anything.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00092	That kid escaped through this\nhole in the fence.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00093	Maybe this hole will be good\nenough evidence.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00095	This hole could be enough to\nprove my innocence.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00096	There's a big hole in the chain-link fence.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00097	I already took a picture of this.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00098	I should show this to Tommy\nas proof.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00100	I took a photo with that kid in it.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00101	This would be good to show.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00102	There's a big hole in the chain-link fence.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00103	You've already taken a photo of this.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00104	There's a big hole in the chain link fence.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00105	Is this the fence out back?
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00106	Yeah, see that big hole? The kid\nescaped through there.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00107	I saw the hole last time I was out\nthere, but...
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00108	I didn't see anyone sneaking\nthrough it.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00109	Ugh, I've shown you all this and\nyou still don't believe me?
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00110	OK, OK, I've seen enough. I guess\nit must have been someone else.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00111	Check this out! It's a photo of the\ndog that was hanging out with\nthe kid.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00112	You're trying to blame a dog?\nCute picture. Nice try.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00113	It doesn't prove you aren't the\none who did it.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00114	I can't believe this...
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00115	Here, look! You can see the kid!
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00116	Say what? So the one who was\nraiding the storage room...
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00117	Finally! It was him, I'm telling you!
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00119	This should do it. No way Tommy\ncan argue with this.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00120	I already have a photo of this.\nI only need to show Tommy one.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00121	Not bad, but I've already shown\nTommy a photo like this.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00124	Maybe one more photo will finally\nconvince Tommy...
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00125	Hopefully these are enough.
ACR_Mystery_1_4_00126	I don't have any evidence yet.
ACR_2_Scenario_00001	Thanks again for talking to me.\nAbout my mom, I mean.
ACR_2_Scenario_00002	Right.
ACR_2_Scenario_00003	Until we meet again.
ACR_2_Scenario_00004	Can I ask you what you were\ntalking about earlier?
ACR_2_Scenario_00005	Oh, that's nothing to worry\nabout. Just enjoy the food.
ACR_2_Scenario_00006	...All right.
ACR_2_Scenario_00007	Um...
ACR_2_Scenario_00008	I am stuffed! You're welcome to\nthe rest, if you want.
ACR_2_Scenario_00009	Thanks?
ACR_2_Scenario_00010	Hey, so...
ACR_2_Scenario_00011	This is some choice meat!\nEat up!
ACR_2_Scenario_00013	Uh, sure.
ACR_2_Scenario_00014	Having fun, Ashley?
ACR_2_Scenario_00015	Oh, um... Yeah...
ACR_2_Scenario_00016	I'm happy to hear that! Do let\nme know if you need anything.
ACR_2_Scenario_00017	I will. Thanks.
ACR_2_Scenario_00018	I think Dan's been looking for me.
ACR_2_Scenario_00019	Be careful out there, Ashley.
ACR_2_Scenario_00020	Don't worry. I will.
ACR_2_Scenario_00021	So, in order to get to the\ndoctor's cottage...
ACR_2_Scenario_00022	Head to the path that leads to\nthe lakeside and turn right, and\nthen, let's see...
ACR_2_Scenario_00023	There's a covered bridge. If you\ngo just past that, it's the house\nimmediately on your left.
ACR_2_Scenario_00024	Got it.
ACR_2_Scenario_00025	We'll chat more soon, OK?
ACR_2_Scenario_00026	We should sit down soon. There's\na lot I could tell you.
ACR_2_Scenario_00027	What is with those two? It's kind\nof weirding me out...
ACR_2_Scenario_00028	Ugh! I'm mad just thinking\nabout what happened...
ACR_2_Scenario_00029	I need some water or something.\nI'm so mad, I made myself thirsty.
ACR_2_Scenario_00030	I'll go find something to drink\nat Dad's cabin.
ACR_2_Scenario_00031	This isn't the way to the cottage.
ACR_2_Scenario_00032	The hole's been fixed...in a way.\nLooks like Tommy's handiwork.
ACR_2_Scenario_00033	He clearly takes maintenance\nissues seriously.
ACR_2_Scenario_00100	Tommy isn't here, so I could\nprobably go in if I wanted...
ACR_2_Scenario_00101	I shouldn't go in there\nwithout permission.
ACR_2_Scenario_00034	I'm pretty sure I saw that kid\nhead in this direction...
ACR_2_Scenario_00035	Could he have gone in the shed?
ACR_2_Scenario_00106	The door's open...
ACR_2_Scenario_00036	I can rule out this direction.
ACR_2_Scenario_00107	Where could that kid have gone?
ACR_2_Scenario_00108	Heeelp...
ACR_2_Scenario_00109	Was that...someone's voice?
ACR_2_Scenario_00054	Heeelp...
ACR_2_Scenario_00055	That's a voice!
ACR_2_Scenario_00056	No way! It's coming from inside\nthe well?!
ACR_2_Scenario_00112	Matthew's not here. Where'd\nhe go?
ACR_2_Scenario_00113	What do I do now?
ACR_2_Scenario_00114	Guess I'll go to Dad's place.
ACR_2_Scenario_00060	Hey, there's Tommy.
ACR_2_Scenario_00061	I guess I have no reason to visit\nthe campsite right now.
ACR_2_Scenario_00062	I have no money for a bus ticket,\neither, so I'm stuck here.
ACR_2_Scenario_00115	Let's go see what we can learn\nabout your dad.
ACR_2_Scenario_00116	All right!
ACR_2_00004	Pleasure to meet you.
ACR_2_00005	My name is Ryan Gray. I work\nwith Dr. Robins.
ACR_2_00006	Do you have time to chat?
ACR_2_00009	Nice to meet you.
ACR_2_00010	Have I seen this guy before?
ACR_2_00011	I swear I've met him somewhere.\nIt must be my imagination.
ACR_2_00013	Do you truly doubt\nyour memories?
ACR_2_00014	Huh? What?
ACR_2_00015	I know what was going through\nyour mind just now.
ACR_2_00016	"I feel like I've met him before,\nbut it's just my imagination."
ACR_2_00017	Isn't that right?
ACR_2_00019	How could you know that?
ACR_2_00020	I'm a behavioral psychologist, you\nsee. Plus, your facial expressions\nare quite easy to read.
ACR_2_00022	Are you saying I have a bad\npoker face?
ACR_2_00024	You're the same as ever. Always\nupfront with your emotions.
ACR_2_00026	Wait, so you do know me?
ACR_2_00027	What's your guess?
ACR_2_00028	I was here with my mom 13\nyears ago...
ACR_2_00029	So maybe I saw you then.
ACR_2_00030	Nice deduction.
ACR_2_00031	Myelination in our hippocampus\nis a slow process, said to only\nfinish when we're around four\nyears old.
ACR_2_00032	That's why most people can't\nremember their early years.
ACR_2_00034	OK...
ACR_2_00035	But as soon as I got here, I\nremembered... Mom and I...
ACR_2_00037	You remembered something from\nall those years ago?
ACR_2_00038	Yeah.
ACR_2_00039	I'm not even sure I'd heard of\nLake Juliet before.
ACR_2_00040	But once I was here and saw\nthe place...
ACR_2_00041	I remembered the scenery and\nbeing here with Mom. 
ACR_2_00042	But if you asked me if I was sure\nthose memories were real...
ACR_2_00043	I wouldn't be able to say yes.
ACR_2_00046	As I said, it's tough to recall\nevents from that early in life.
ACR_2_00047	Yet, sometimes, an event can\nbring them to the surface.
ACR_2_00048	Some call these sudden\nmemories "flashbacks."
ACR_2_00049	They often occur after\npsychological trauma.
ACR_2_00050	Do you remember ever having\nsuch an experience?
ACR_2_00052	Yeah. I do.
ACR_2_00053	My mom died on the night of my\nthird birthday.
ACR_2_00054	That was 13 years ago.
ACR_2_00055	Ah, yes. That's right.
ACR_2_00056	Sayoko Robins. She was only\n28 years old.
ACR_2_00058	You know what happened\nto my mom?
ACR_2_00059	Of course.
ACR_2_00060	As a memory researcher\nmyself, the sudden death of\nSayoko Robins...
ACR_2_00061	was an unforgettable tragedy.
ACR_2_00062	To meet her daughter after all\nthese years is truly remarkable.
ACR_2_00064	You and I have <color=#00994CFF>a lot in common</color>.
ACR_2_00068	Speaking with you like this brings\nback memories of <color=#00994CFF>Sayoko</color>.
ACR_2_00069	Particularly your eyes. It's like\nyour mother is looking out at me.
ACR_2_00073	She was a genius. She began her\nresearch at just <color=#00994CFF>16 years old</color>.
ACR_2_00074	That was around the time when\nI first met her.
ACR_2_00075	She was a scientist by the time\nshe was my age?!
ACR_2_00076	That's incredible!
ACR_2_00078	Your mother was an\noutstanding scientist.
ACR_2_00079	I could never forget her.
ACR_2_00090	You said you and I are alike...\nHow is that?
ACR_2_00091	I lost my mother when I was\nthree too.
ACR_2_00093	Really?
ACR_2_00095	Yes.
ACR_2_00097	Do you wish you could\nremember her?
ACR_2_00098	That's never been a desire.
ACR_2_00099	What?
ACR_2_00100	Does one need memories of\ntheir mother for a happy life?
ACR_2_00101	Well, my memories of my mom\nare precious to me.
ACR_2_00102	And without her, I wouldn't be\nwho I am.
ACR_2_00103	I want to know everything about\nmy mom. I want to remember her.
ACR_2_00105	I strongly empathize with how\nimportant Sayoko was to you.
ACR_2_00106	Yes, we really are a lot alike.
ACR_2_00107	How else are we alike?
ACR_2_00108	We should discuss that some\nother time.
ACR_2_00111	Is it really true that my mom was\ndoing scientific research at 16?
ACR_2_00112	Yes, it is.
ACR_2_00114	Ugh.
ACR_2_00115	What's the matter?
ACR_2_00116	I'm just so average compared\nto her.
ACR_2_00117	Are you interested in the\nsciences as well?
ACR_2_00119	No, not really.
ACR_2_00120	I don't want to be like my dad.
ACR_2_00121	I see. Well then, what do\nyou want to be?
ACR_2_00123	I play guitar in a band. We're\ngonna be huge!
ACR_2_00125	A band. Interesting.
ACR_2_00127	Yeah, I wanna be onstage!
ACR_2_00128	I want to move people with my\nmusic. I wanna make them feel\nsomething!
ACR_2_00129	I think everyone has a grand\ndesign like that at one point\nor another.
ACR_2_00130	I suppose that's what they refer\nto as a dream.
ACR_2_00133	It's interesting to see how you\nthink about the future.
ACR_2_00134	Your eyes may be\nyour mother's...
ACR_2_00135	but on the inside, you're just like\nyour father.
ACR_2_00136	That...might be the worst thing\nanyone's ever said to me...
ACR_2_00147	You said Mom was unforgettable.\nCan you tell me more about her?
ACR_2_00148	I remember Sayoko like I saw\nher yesterday.
ACR_2_00149	But my memories of her... I guess\nI'd like to keep those for myself.
ACR_2_00150	What? Why?
ACR_2_00151	I've never met a smarter person.\nShe was a brilliant scientist.
ACR_2_00152	It's because of her that I am\nwho I am today.
ACR_2_00153	So maybe it's selfishness that\nmakes me want to keep them\nfor myself.\n
ACR_2_00154	And it's probably a very strange\nthing to say to her daughter.
ACR_2_00155	No, I get it... I guess...
ACR_2_00156	I'm no good at explaining why I\nlike certain guitarists and stuff,\nso I get it.
ACR_2_00174	Thanks for telling me about\nmy mom.
ACR_2_00175	I'm glad I got the chance to\nspeak with you.
ACR_2_00176	Same here.
ACR_2_00177	By the way, what is that?
ACR_2_00178	Oh, this?
ACR_2_00179	It's my mom's pendant.
ACR_2_00180	I see.
ACR_2_00181	It's very beautiful...
ACR_2_00186	Ashley!
ACR_2_00188	Dan!
ACR_2_00189	I wonder what he wants...
ACR_2_00190	Maybe he found a lead about\nmy bag.
ACR_2_00191	Um... Ryan, I...
ACR_2_00192	It's all right. Go ahead.
ACR_2_00194	What's up, Dan?
ACR_2_00195	Sorry to interrupt your\ncamping fun.
ACR_2_00196	But I wanted to ask... Here, take\na look at this photo.
ACR_2_00198	Is this who stole your bag?
ACR_2_00200	Yeah! That's him!
ACR_2_00201	So my hunch was right...
ACR_2_00202	There's a <color=#00994CFF>missing persons report\n</color>on him.
ACR_2_00203	Wow, really?
ACR_2_00205	Let me know if you see him\nagain, OK?
ACR_2_00206	Yeah. All right.
ACR_2_00207	Were you able to meet up with\nyour dad?
ACR_2_00208	Yeah.
ACR_2_00209	Glad to hear it! Having fun\ncamping with him?
ACR_2_00210	Well...something urgent came up\nat his lab, and he had to go.
ACR_2_00211	Lab?
ACR_2_00212	Hang on... Is your dad involved\nwith J.C. Valley?
ACR_2_00213	Yeah.
ACR_2_00214	Oh, of course... You told me your\nlast name is Robins.
ACR_2_00215	So your dad must be <color=#00994CFF>Dr. Robins</color>!
ACR_2_00222	Hang on. That kid was reported\nmissing?
ACR_2_00223	Yeah, he ran away from home.\nBeen missing for three days.
ACR_2_00224	This isn't the first time he's done\nit, either.
ACR_2_00225	Last time was this past August.\nThey found him near here.
ACR_2_00226	Oh, wow. He's run away more\nthan once.
ACR_2_00227	Well... The kid's got his reasons.
ACR_2_00228	And he always comes to\nLake Juliet.
ACR_2_00229	What reasons?
ACR_2_00230	His name's Matthew Crusoe.\nHe's 13.
ACR_2_00231	Let me know if you see him?
ACR_2_00232	Sure. You bet.
ACR_2_00235	Why did you say my dad "must be"\nDr. Robins?
ACR_2_00236	Do you know him?
ACR_2_00240	It was, oh, maybe two\nmonths back?
ACR_2_00241	He was fishing, and I taught him\nhow to properly bait his hook.
ACR_2_00243	I...cannot imagine Dad fishing.
ACR_2_00244	Well, something tells me he hasn't\nbeen at it for too long.
ACR_2_00249	You don't say...
ACR_2_00250	Still, your dad's really funny.
ACR_2_00251	Funny? My dad?
ACR_2_00252	He's like a kid. His eyes sparkle\nwhen he tries something new.
ACR_2_00253	He gets absorbed in it, like it's\nthe only thing in the world.
ACR_2_00254	He's been especially interested\nin Lake Juliet lately.
ACR_2_00255	Every time I run into him, he has\nmore questions about it.
ACR_2_00259	Well, back to patrolling for me.
ACR_2_00260	OK.
ACR_2_00261	We'll find your bag. Wait for your\ndad to get back, and have fun.
ACR_2_00262	Thanks, Dan.
ACR_2_00266	Sorry, Ryan. That's the forest\nranger who's...
ACR_2_00268	Ryan?
ACR_2_00271	Where'd he... Huh.
ACR_2_00275	Uh-oh.
ACR_2_00277	Huh?
ACR_2_00279	What's up, Ian?
ACR_2_00281	Dr. Robins forgot his hat.
ACR_2_00282	So he did.
ACR_2_00284	Ah, looks like they're cleaning up.
ACR_2_00289	Ashley, you got a second?
ACR_2_00292	What's up?
ACR_2_00294	Your dad forgot his hat.
ACR_2_00295	Would you mind taking it to\nhis cottage?
ACR_2_00296	This is Dad's?
ACR_2_00297	I do not get his taste in fashion.\nAt all.
ACR_2_00298	He bought it online, just for this\ncamping trip.
ACR_2_00299	We'll take care of the cleanup\nhere, so will you take this to him?
ACR_2_00300	You bet.
ACR_2_00301	Which way is Dad's cottage?
ACR_2_00303	It's just past the covered bridge.
ACR_2_00304	Got it. Um. What covered bridge?
ACR_2_00305	Be specific, Ian. She doesn't\nknow her way around here.
ACR_2_00306	Right, right.
ACR_2_00307	Turn right onto the road that\nleads to the lakeshore. You\nwon't be able to miss the bridge.
ACR_2_00308	The cottages are just past it. His\nis the one closest to the bridge.
ACR_2_00309	Got it?
ACR_2_00310	Umm... Yep! Probably.
ACR_2_00311	Oh, and along the way, you'll pass\nan old boathouse...
ACR_2_00312	Stay away from it, all right?
ACR_2_00313	Why?
ACR_2_00314	There's a shady guy in sunglasses\nhanging out around there.
ACR_2_00315	So take the long way around\nif you need to. And keep an eye\nout for him.
ACR_2_00316	All right, got it.
ACR_2_00317	Thanks for taking care of the hat!
ACR_2_00323	You're Dr. Robins's daughter,\naren't you?
ACR_2_00324	Yeah. I'm Ashley.
ACR_2_00325	I'm Sofia Callaghan.
ACR_2_00326	I'm on your father's memory-\nresearch team at J.C. Valley.
ACR_2_00327	We didn't get a chance to talk\ntoday, but I'd love to chat later.
ACR_2_00331	Hey, Ashley. I didn't properly\nintroduce myself.
ACR_2_00332	I'm Rex Alfred, the director\nof J.C. Valley.
ACR_2_00333	We didn't get to chat earlier, but\nlet's talk soon.
ACR_2_00335	Oh, it's Tommy.
ACR_2_00336	He's with that girl from\nthe campsite...
ACR_2_00340	I'll help. Where were you when\nyou realized it was missing?
ACR_2_00341	I don't even remember...
ACR_2_00342	Don't worry. We'll find it.
ACR_2_00343	But...
ACR_2_00348	Tommy? What's wrong?
ACR_2_00349	Oh, it's you!
ACR_2_00350	...
ACR_2_00353	You're Elizabeth, right?\nI'm Ashley.
ACR_2_00354	I saw you earlier, but I couldn't\nreally say hi.
ACR_2_00355	...
ACR_2_00357	Aaand ignored...
ACR_2_00359	I heard you're looking for\nsomething? What is it?
ACR_2_00360	Elizabeth lost her music player.\nWe're out here looking for it.
ACR_2_00361	There's a demo on that player\nthat we can't lose.
ACR_2_00362	Is Elizabeth in your band?
ACR_2_00363	Oh, we're—
ACR_2_00365	Tommy? Why does this kid know\nabout the band?
ACR_2_00366	I heard about it at the\nguesthouse.
ACR_2_00367	I asked Tommy.
ACR_2_00368	...
ACR_2_00369	I told her I'm in a band and I\nwrite songs.
ACR_2_00370	Are you serious?
ACR_2_00372	I'm thirsty. I need a drink.
ACR_2_00373	We gotta find the music\nplayer first.
ACR_2_00374	I'll look after I get a drink.
ACR_2_00375	Have you even started looking?\nCome on, I'll help.
ACR_2_00376	Why? We're never gonna find it...\nI've had enough of this.
ACR_2_00379	You can't just give up. It's \nsomewhere out here.
ACR_2_00380	Plus it's important, isn't it? It's\nyour band's demo.
ACR_2_00382	Excuse me?
ACR_2_00385	Who do you think you are, telling\nme what I should do?
ACR_2_00386	What? No! I'm sorry if—
ACR_2_00387	I don't want to hear it.
ACR_2_00388	Elizabeth, she's just trying\nto help.
ACR_2_00389	Oh, so you're taking her side?\nWhat a jerk.
ACR_2_00390	What?! No! That's not it! You're\nfreaking out over nothing!
ACR_2_00394	Come on, stop fighting.
ACR_2_00395	Who are you, anyway? Why are\nyou even here?
ACR_2_00396	Ashley's dad is Dr. Robins.\nHe works at J.C. Valley.
ACR_2_00398	Well, my dad's the director of\nJ.C. Valley.
ACR_2_00399	Which means my dad is your\ndad's boss.
ACR_2_00400	What's that have to do with us?
ACR_2_00401	I just thought it was something\nyou should know.
ACR_2_00402	I don't see why I should care.
ACR_2_00403	So you're going to be like\nthat, huh?
ACR_2_00404	How old are you, anyway?
ACR_2_00410	I'm 18.
ACR_2_00411	You don't look it.
ACR_2_00412	I-I don't?
ACR_2_00413	There's no way you're older\nthan me.
ACR_2_00414	So how old are you?
ACR_2_00415	I'm 16.
ACR_2_00416	You're 16?
ACR_2_00418	What? You have a problem?
ACR_2_00419	Hah. You're younger than me.
ACR_2_00420	Makes sense though. You act\nlike a little kid.
ACR_2_00424	I'm 16.
ACR_2_00425	There's no way you're the same\nage as me!
ACR_2_00426	What? Why?
ACR_2_00427	I figured you were, like, 14.
ACR_2_00428	Yeah, I don't believe you.
ACR_2_00429	I have trouble believing we're\nthe same age too.
ACR_2_00433	Could you just leave already?
ACR_2_00434	You're so annoying.
ACR_2_00435	I'll leave, but why do you have to\nbe like this?
ACR_2_00436	Like what?!
ACR_2_00437	Seriously?!
ACR_2_00439	Enough, already!
ACR_2_00440	Hmph!
ACR_2_00441	Ugh.
ACR_2_00444	I'm sorry, Ashley.
ACR_2_00445	You're busy, right? I've got this\ncovered. You can take off.
ACR_2_00446	Tommy...
ACR_2_00447	Hmph.
ACR_2_00448	All right. I got it. See ya later,\nI guess.
ACR_2_00449	See you later.
ACR_2_00451	Look... I know you're frustrated,\nbut that was not cool.
ACR_2_00452	Sorry.
ACR_2_00455	Let's just look for it later.
ACR_2_00456	Now I need to cool down. Let's\ngo to Bob's.
ACR_2_00457	Yeah. OK. That sounds good.
ACR_2_01341	(Exert Noise)
ACR_2_00462	Whoa... It's beautiful.
ACR_2_00463	So this is Lake Juliet, huh?
ACR_2_00464	Ah!
ACR_2_00466	Mom?
ACR_2_00467	...
ACR_2_00468	Mommy?
ACR_2_00469	I remember... Mom brought me here.
ACR_2_01165	Someone's there...
ACR_2_01166	Understood. We'll talk\nagain soon.
ACR_2_01167	*gasp*
ACR_2_01168	What's up with that guy?
ACR_2_01169	Is that who Gina told me about?
ACR_2_01170	A suspicious man in sunglasses\nhanging around the boathouse...
ACR_2_01171	What's he up to?
ACR_2_01172	*rustle*
ACR_2_01173	Uh...
ACR_2_01174	You're the bag thief!
ACR_2_01175	Ahhh!
ACR_2_01176	Stop right there!
ACR_2_01177	Huh?
ACR_2_00505	Help! Somebody help me!
ACR_2_00506	That's that kid...
ACR_2_00507	Get me outta here!
ACR_2_01192	What are you doing down there?
ACR_2_01193	Trying to hide! But I got stuck.
ACR_2_00508	Ugh...
ACR_2_00509	OK, fine. I'll go get someone. Just\nhang on.
ACR_2_00511	Wait, no!
ACR_2_00513	Don't!
ACR_2_00514	I can't get you out of there by\nmyself. I'll get the forest ranger.
ACR_2_00515	And once you're out, he'll arrest\nyou for stealing my bag!
ACR_2_00516	Oh, please, not Dan!
ACR_2_00517	Are you really gonna be picky\nabout who rescues you?
ACR_2_00518	I'll give you your bag\nback! Please!
ACR_2_00520	But if you call Dan, I won't tell\nyou where I hid it!
ACR_2_00521	What's with this little jerk?
ACR_2_00522	Help me, and you'll get your bag\nback. I promise!
ACR_2_00523	Fine.
ACR_2_00530	That was rough.
ACR_2_00531	I was freaking out down there!
ACR_2_00532	Well, maybe next time don't climb\ndown a well! That's dangerous!
ACR_2_00533	Yeah, but...
ACR_2_00534	But what?
ACR_2_00535	There was nowhere else to run.
ACR_2_00536	You wouldn't have to run if you\nhadn't stolen my bag.
ACR_2_00537	Yeah, but...
ACR_2_00538	There's no excuse!
ACR_2_00539	That's not all you did. Swiping\nfood from the guesthouse?
ACR_2_00540	But I only stole your bag because\nsome <color=#00994CFF>lady</color> asked me to.
ACR_2_00541	As for the food, well... I was just\nso hungry. <color=#00994CFF>What else could I do?</color>
ACR_2_00542	Not to mention you implicated a\ndog in your crimes!
ACR_2_00543	Hey, <color=#00994CFF>that dog</color> followed me!
ACR_2_00545	Listen...
ACR_2_00546	Do you understand that what\nyou did was wrong?
ACR_2_00548	I do. Really!
ACR_2_00549	It's just... I've got a lot going on\nin my life.
ACR_2_00550	I guess that's what happens when\nyou run away from home.
ACR_2_00551	What?!
ACR_2_00552	How do you know about that?
ACR_2_00553	Oh, I know more than that.
ACR_2_00554	Matthew Crusoe.
ACR_2_00556	Who told you my name?!
ACR_2_00557	Dan said you were reported\nmissing.
ACR_2_00558	So, why'd you run away?
ACR_2_00559	That's none of your business.
ACR_2_00561	What's the matter? Why do you\nlook so down all of a sudden?
ACR_2_00562	...
ACR_2_00563	Well?
ACR_2_00564	Hmph.
ACR_2_00565	Matthew?
ACR_2_00566	Yeah?
ACR_2_00567	It's OK. You don't have to tell\nme why you ran away.
ACR_2_00568	Mhm.
ACR_2_00570	Hey, you haven't told me your\nname yet.
ACR_2_00571	Oh, yeah. I guess not.
ACR_2_00572	I'm Ashley. Ashley Mizuki Robins.
ACR_2_00573	I'm sorry I stole your bag, Ashley.
ACR_2_00581	Who's this woman that told you\nto steal my bag?
ACR_2_00582	No idea.
ACR_2_00583	Why would she have you do that?
ACR_2_00584	No clue.
ACR_2_00585	Well, did you give her my bag?
ACR_2_00586	No, I hid it in the boathouse.
ACR_2_00587	That's where she said to put it.
ACR_2_00590	How did you get into the\nstorage room?
ACR_2_00591	The door was supposed to\nbe locked.
ACR_2_00592	I used the key card.
ACR_2_00593	It's my dad's key card.
ACR_2_00595	Your dad's key card? So does he\nwork in the guesthouse?
ACR_2_00596	No.
ACR_2_00597	Then why would he have\nthat card?
ACR_2_00598	I don't know, OK?
ACR_2_00601	So that wasn't your dog? I hope\nit's not a stray.
ACR_2_00602	It was near the campsite. I only\nplayed with it for a minute...
ACR_2_00603	But it started following me all\nover. And now it's wandered off.
ACR_2_01194	Hmm...
ACR_2_01195	What?
ACR_2_00608	Look, I don't care who told you\nto do it...
ACR_2_00609	But it's never OK to steal!
ACR_2_00610	But I had to! I had no choice...
ACR_2_00611	You're still making excuses?
ACR_2_00612	You can't do stuff like that!
ACR_2_00613	Running away's a bad call too.\nYour family's gotta be worried!
ACR_2_00615	Trust me, they're not.
ACR_2_00616	My uncle even knows I'm here.
ACR_2_00617	And he's still not coming to\nget me, so...
ACR_2_00618	Your uncle?
ACR_2_00619	My dad's brother. I live with him.
ACR_2_00620	What about your mom and dad?
ACR_2_00621	They're...not around.
ACR_2_00622	My mom got sick... She passed\naway. And my dad...
ACR_2_00623	He went missing. Five years ago.
ACR_2_00624	He went missing?
ACR_2_00625	Yeah, and that's why I'm here.
ACR_2_00626	There's <color=#00994CFF>something I need to do</color>.
ACR_2_00633	What do you mean, "something\nyou need to do"?
ACR_2_00634	I'm looking for clues to where\nmy dad went.
ACR_2_01207	That lady made me a deal.
ACR_2_00635	She said if I stole your bag, she'd\ntell me about him.
ACR_2_00636	You're looking for clues? What\nsort of clues?
ACR_2_00638	Can you keep a secret?
ACR_2_00639	Yeah...
ACR_2_00640	OK... The truth is...
ACR_2_00641	My dad didn't go missing. <color=#00994CFF>He was\nabducted</color>. And I'm searching\nfor him.
ACR_2_00646	Abducted? For real?
ACR_2_00647	For real.
ACR_2_00648	Ashley, my <color=#00994CFF>dad's rich</color>.
ACR_2_00649	Really?
ACR_2_00650	Yeah! Crazy rich!
ACR_2_00651	OK... And?
ACR_2_00652	And five years ago, he was\nabducted from here!
ACR_2_00653	By who?
ACR_2_00654	Isn't it obvious? A gang\nof kidnappers!
ACR_2_00655	Uh-huh... And then?
ACR_2_00656	The kidnappers demanded\na ton of money.
ACR_2_00657	But my uncle couldn't pay them,\nso they never let him go.
ACR_2_00658	He's been missing ever since...\nBut I'm sure he's still alive.
ACR_2_00659	And you came here looking for\nclues to where he might be?
ACR_2_00660	Exactly!
ACR_2_00667	So your dad's rich, right?
ACR_2_00668	Super rich.
ACR_2_00669	Then why didn't your uncle\npay the ransom?
ACR_2_00670	Well, my dad's rich...
ACR_2_00671	but my uncle isn't.
ACR_2_00672	Plus, he doesn't have the key to\nmy dad's vault.
ACR_2_00673	His vault...
ACR_2_00674	I'm telling the truth! My dad's so\nrich, and he was abducted.
ACR_2_00675	And I'm searching for him!
ACR_2_00676	Because he's rich, and...and...
ACR_2_00677	And?
ACR_2_00678	Ashley...
ACR_2_00679	You believe me, don't you?
ACR_2_00685	No.
ACR_2_00686	Why not?
ACR_2_00687	Your rich father was abducted\nby a gang and held for ransom...
ACR_2_00688	Now who in their right mind\nwould believe a story like that?
ACR_2_00689	...
ACR_2_00692	You're just making up stories.
ACR_2_00693	What?
ACR_2_00694	Your rich father was abducted\nby a gang and held for ransom...
ACR_2_00695	It's just so...farfetched. You've\ngotta be making it up.
ACR_2_00696	...
ACR_2_01196	That stuff happens in movies,\nnot in real life.
ACR_2_01197	...
ACR_2_01198	Just stop making up stories and\napologize. You gotta grow up\none of these days.
ACR_2_01199	*gasp*
ACR_2_01200	If you just had the maturity\nto apologize...
ACR_2_00699	How old are you?
ACR_2_00700	Huh?
ACR_2_00701	I'm 16.
ACR_2_00702	Hmph, 16, huh?
ACR_2_00704	Y-yeah... Why?
ACR_2_00705	You're only a little older than\nme. So quit acting like you're\nso much more grown up.
ACR_2_00706	What?
ACR_2_00708	You're just like everyone else!
ACR_2_01204	Matthew!
ACR_2_00713	He ran away.
ACR_2_01205	Maybe I was too harsh...
ACR_2_01206	Hey, wait! Where's my bag?
ACR_2_01208	Yo, Ashley!
ACR_2_00723	Hey. I'm sorry about earlier.
ACR_2_00724	No worries. I'm already over it.
ACR_2_00725	Thanks for being cool about it.
ACR_2_00726	Did you find the music player?
ACR_2_00727	No, not yet.
ACR_2_00728	I hope you find it soon.
ACR_2_00731	Hello.
ACR_2_00732	You were at the camp earlier,\nweren't you? I forget your name.
ACR_2_00733	Janet.
ACR_2_00734	I'm...
ACR_2_00735	Ashley, right?
ACR_2_00736	I heard from Tommy. So you got\ninto a fight with Elizabeth, huh?
ACR_2_00737	I got angry and said some stuff.\nProbably went too far though.
ACR_2_00738	Don't worry. She's always\nthat way.
ACR_2_00739	Oh... Wow.
ACR_2_00740	But getting into a fight the first\ntime you meet her? That's brave.
ACR_2_00741	I thought the same thing.
ACR_2_00743	You're both friends with\nElizabeth, aren't you?
ACR_2_00744	Yeah.
ACR_2_00745	Wow.
ACR_2_00746	You're thinking, "How are they\nfriends with someone like that?"
ACR_2_00747	Almost word for word.
ACR_2_00748	Well, we know the real Elizabeth.
ACR_2_00749	She's really talented. Plus she's\ngot great taste in music and\nkiller style.
ACR_2_00750	That's why the three of us\nstarted <color=#00994CFF>a band</color> together.
ACR_2_00751	And we entered our band into<color=#00994CFF>\n</color>a <color=#00994CFF>contest</color>.
ACR_2_00752	Yeah!
ACR_2_00758	What do you two play?
ACR_2_00759	I play guitar. Janet's on drums.
ACR_2_00760	What about Elizabeth?
ACR_2_00761	Keyboard and vocals.
ACR_2_00762	We're really just doing it for\nfun though.
ACR_2_00763	Not true! You play guitar like\na rock star!
ACR_2_00764	The girls that come to our shows\nall swoon over Tommy.
ACR_2_00765	Oh, come on. Knock it off!
ACR_2_00768	So what's this contest you're in?
ACR_2_00769	Is it the Big-Deal Band Contest?
ACR_2_00770	That's it, yeah!
ACR_2_00771	That contest is the quickest way\nto get a recording contract.
ACR_2_00772	You wanna get signed?
ACR_2_00773	Of course!
ACR_2_00777	Oh. OK, cool.
ACR_2_00778	So these two are going to be in\nthe contest too...
ACR_2_00779	But so is Elizabeth.
ACR_2_00781	I play guitar too.
ACR_2_00782	Oh yeah? Right on.
ACR_2_00783	No wonder you knew about\nthe contest.
ACR_2_00784	You oughta play with us \nsometime, Ashley.
ACR_2_00785	I left my guitar at home, but sure,\nif I get a chance.
ACR_2_00786	Looking forward to it.
ACR_2_00788	Hey, sorry, we gotta get going.\nPractice time, ya know.
ACR_2_00789	See ya later, Ashley.
ACR_2_00790	See ya!
ACR_2_00791	Bye!
ACR_2_01209	Band practice... I'm so jealous.
ACR_2_01210	I'd love to be able to play my\nguitar right now...
ACR_2_01211	So that's the boathouse...
ACR_2_01212	Hm?
ACR_2_01213	That's Matthew.
ACR_2_01214	What's he doing hanging\naround here?
ACR_2_00826	What are you doing here?
ACR_2_01218	Ashley!
ACR_2_01219	I hid your bag right here, but\nnow it's missing.
ACR_2_00828	What?
ACR_2_00829	I promised that lady I'd give\nher the bag tonight.
ACR_2_00830	She was gonna tell me about\nmy dad!
ACR_2_00832	She tricked me.
ACR_2_00833	She was lying to me from\nthe start.
ACR_2_00837	I'm sorry for losing your bag.\nFor stealing it, then losing it.
ACR_2_00838	Oh, an apology? How you've\ngrown since last we spoke.
ACR_2_00839	Well, you did rescue me and all...\nSo I wanted to return your bag.
ACR_2_00840	I was a little harsh on you\nearlier. I'm sorry.
ACR_2_01220	I should have listened to what\nyou had to say.
ACR_2_00841	You're saying you believe me?
ACR_2_00842	There could be some truth to it.
ACR_2_01221	I'm not like everyone else. But\nmaybe I'm not as mature as I'd\nlike to think, either.
ACR_2_01222	Thanks, Ashley.
ACR_2_00870	I'm sorry... But I did lie.
ACR_2_00871	My dad did go missing five years\nago. That part's true.
ACR_2_00873	There are people who choose to\ndisappear, I know...
ACR_2_00874	But not my dad. Something\nhappened to him.
ACR_2_00875	I waited by the door for him\nevery day, even when it started\nto make my mom mad.
ACR_2_00876	Then one day, she got so mad\nshe started yelling. And then\nshe burst into tears.
ACR_2_00877	That's when I finally decided to\ngive it up.
ACR_2_00878	But then she got sick. She was\nadmitted to the hospital, and...
ACR_2_00879	It's OK...
ACR_2_00880	After she died, all I wanted was\nto see my dad again...
ACR_2_00881	So I decided to come look\nfor him.
ACR_2_00885	I get it, Matthew. I really do.
ACR_2_00886	I'm going to find him, no\nmatter what.
ACR_2_00887	I know how you feel, but it's still\nnot OK to run away from home.
ACR_2_00888	Your uncle must be worried.\nYou should call him.
ACR_2_00889	I know... I just need a little\nmore time.
ACR_2_00890	I'm so close to finding something\nthat will lead to my dad.
ACR_2_00891	I mean, I already found that <color=#00994CFF>guy\nin the sunglasses</color>!
ACR_2_00896	Is that who you saw while you\nwere hiding?
ACR_2_00897	He's behind it all! I just know it!
ACR_2_00900	He's been snooping all around\nLake Juliet.
ACR_2_00902	He's gotta be working with the\nlady who had me steal your bag!
ACR_2_00905	What?
ACR_2_00906	He must be! He's so suspicious.
ACR_2_00907	This boathouse is the only place\nI didn't search last year.
ACR_2_00908	That guy's going around\ncovering his tracks!
ACR_2_01223	Are you for real right now?
ACR_2_01224	My dad built this boathouse.
ACR_2_01225	So I'm gonna take a look\naround inside.
ACR_2_01226	By yourself? No, no, no. That\nguy might be in there.
ACR_2_01227	Uh... Wh-what?
ACR_2_01228	If you're so worried about me,\nyou could always tag along.
ACR_2_01229	You're not leaving me much\nchoice, are you?
ACR_2_01230	It's not like Dad needs his hat\nright this minute...
ACR_2_01231	OK, fine. I'll search the boathouse\nwith you. But then I'm done.
ACR_2_01232	Great! Thanks, Ashley.
ACR_2_00916	Let's go have a look.
ACR_2_00917	Yeah!
ACR_2_00920	Locked. Figures.
ACR_2_00921	What do we do?
ACR_2_00922	Hmm...
ACR_2_01340	Maybe my key card...
ACR_2_00924	No good.
ACR_2_00925	There must be some way in...
ACR_2_01256	All right, it opened!
ACR_2_01257	Now let's search the boathouse.
ACR_2_01258	Wow, that's a handy little device.\nWhat is it?
ACR_2_01259	Apparently my mom made it...\nShe was a scientist.
ACR_2_01260	Whoa, really?
ACR_2_01261	Yeah. But, on the night of my\nthird birthday...
ACR_2_01262	someone shot her while trying to\nsteal her research. She died...
ACR_2_01263	Seriously?!
ACR_2_01264	Real twist ending, huh?
ACR_2_01265	I'm sorry...
ACR_2_01233	So this is where it lets out... The\nair's so fresh. And what a view!
ACR_2_01234	Wow, no kidding.
ACR_2_01235	Hm?
ACR_2_01236	That...
ACR_2_01237	That clock tower...
ACR_2_01238	I've seen it before.
ACR_2_01241	That's right... I was here\nwith Mom.
ACR_2_01242	Ashley... Ashley!
ACR_2_01243	Huh?
ACR_2_01244	Check it out. There's something\nin the water.
ACR_2_01246	What in the world is it?
ACR_2_00947	Nice!
ACR_2_00948	We did it!
ACR_2_01266	This is my dad's briefcase.
ACR_2_00954	Hurry and open it!
ACR_2_00955	Hold on... It could be bad if\nsomeone finds us out here.
ACR_2_00959	Let's open it in the boathouse.
ACR_2_00961	Good call.
ACR_2_00967	The briefcase is locked.
ACR_2_00968	Looks like a combination lock.
ACR_2_01269	Don't suppose you know\nthe code?
ACR_2_01270	Sure don't.
ACR_2_01271	Then what can we do?
ACR_2_00977	Looks like a floppy disk...
ACR_2_00978	What's a floppy disk?
ACR_2_00979	It's like a USB drive for old\ncomputers. They don't really\nuse them anymore.
ACR_2_00980	There might be something useful,\nbut I don't know if we'll be able to\nread it.
ACR_2_00981	What's your dad's name?
ACR_2_00982	Michael Crusoe.
ACR_2_00983	There's a name on the disk. The\nhandwriting's a little messy...
ACR_2_00984	But it looks like it could be his.
ACR_2_00985	The logo here could be some\nsort of clue too.
ACR_2_00986	That's the logo for my dad's\ncompany!
ACR_2_00989	There's a box.
ACR_2_00990	That's a test tube. Maybe he was\ndoing some experiments?
ACR_2_00991	It says, "Water-quality test kit."
ACR_2_00992	Was your dad's job to test\nwater quality?
ACR_2_01272	I don't know...
ACR_2_00995	Let's see...
ACR_2_00996	There's this stuffed animal.
ACR_2_00998	Is this a bunny? It's kinda cute.
ACR_2_00999	That's Kelly's...
ACR_2_01000	Who's Kelly?
ACR_2_01001	My little sister.
ACR_2_01002	You have a little sister?
ACR_2_01003	Yeah...
ACR_2_01006	Let's take this to my dad's place.
ACR_2_01007	What for?
ACR_2_01008	He's a scientist at J.C. Valley.
ACR_2_01009	Wow, your dad's a scientist too?
ACR_2_01010	Yeah. And he'll have a computer\nwe can use.
ACR_2_01011	We can look up some of this stuff\nwe found.
ACR_2_01012	That sounds great. I've always\nwanted to see a science lab!
ACR_2_01013	Let's go!
ACR_2_01014	Uh... You should probably keep\nyour expectations low...
ACR_2_01019	Is someone in there?!
ACR_2_01021	That's Dan's voice!
ACR_2_01022	What do we do? He'll catch me!
ACR_2_01023	Take the briefcase and hide!
ACR_2_01024	OK!
ACR_2_01029	Oh. Hi, Dan.
ACR_2_01030	Ashley?
ACR_2_01031	Why are you hanging out here\nof all places?
ACR_2_01032	Well...
ACR_2_01035	The door's supposed to\nbe locked.
ACR_2_01036	It was open when I got here.
ACR_2_01037	Weird... I wonder who could've\nopened it.
ACR_2_01038	No idea! But it was wide open.
ACR_2_01039	OK, I get it... But what are you\ndoing in here?
ACR_2_01046	Looking for my bag.
ACR_2_01047	Here?
ACR_2_01048	Sure. Here. There. Everywhere.\nIt's got my whole life in it.
ACR_2_01049	Well, OK.
ACR_2_01050	I haven't found your bag yet,\neither. But I will.
ACR_2_01051	Thank you.
ACR_2_01056	Just checking out the lake.
ACR_2_01057	And you came all the way out\nhere for that?
ACR_2_01058	I figured I'd get a better view.
ACR_2_01059	The view from here is gorgeous.
ACR_2_01063	But listen, Ashley... No one is\nallowed in the boathouse.
ACR_2_01064	It's old and falling apart. It can\nbe dangerous. So stay out, OK?
ACR_2_01065	OK, yeah.
ACR_2_01276	Hm?
ACR_2_01067	What was that sound?
ACR_2_01068	I didn't hear anything.
ACR_2_01069	Hey, did you ever find that\nrunaway?
ACR_2_01072	No... I was actually out this way\nlooking for him.
ACR_2_01073	Oh yeah?
ACR_2_01074	Doesn't look like he's here though.
ACR_2_01075	What will you do when you\nfind him?
ACR_2_01076	Hand him over to the police.\nIt's their job at that point.
ACR_2_01077	Oh. OK.
ACR_2_01078	We found him in an <color=#00994CFF>old house</color>\nlast year. Things got kind\nof rough.
ACR_2_01079	His family came to get him and\ncaused quite the ruckus. They\nwere all shouting at each other.
ACR_2_01080	Even the police didn't know how\nto deal with that one.
ACR_2_01082	Maybe he has his reasons for\nwanting to run away.
ACR_2_01083	I wouldn't doubt it. That kid's\nbeen through a lot.
ACR_2_01084	Like what?
ACR_2_01085	Well, let's see...
ACR_2_01086	His dad was the president of a\nresort-development company.
ACR_2_01087	Resort development?
ACR_2_01091	Crusoe Resort. Went under about\nfive years ago.
ACR_2_01092	They bought up the land\naround here.
ACR_2_01093	Built the campsite, the cottages,\nand turned it into a tourist spot.
ACR_2_01094	But then things went south. They\nwent bankrupt after a while.
ACR_2_01095	The company's building is still\nnear J.C. Valley though.
ACR_2_01096	Oh, interesting.
ACR_2_01097	This boathouse used to belong\nto Crusoe Resort too.
ACR_2_01098	It's property of the lab\nnow though.
ACR_2_01099	It's strange how something like\n<color=#00994CFF>a rumor</color> was all it took to shut\nit down.
ACR_2_01100	Come to think of it, when Crusoe\nstarted developing here...
ACR_2_01101	they tried to buy that old\nclock tower too.
ACR_2_01102	But I guess something on the\nbusiness end didn't work out.
ACR_2_01103	Soon after, that clock's bell\n<color=#00994CFF>tolled its last</color>.
ACR_2_01111	Where's the old house?
ACR_2_01112	It's just past the boathouse.\nTake a right.
ACR_2_01113	It's vacant now, but a famous\nphotographer used to live there.
ACR_2_01114	A famous photographer?
ACR_2_01115	Yep. Moved here from New York\nnine years ago.
ACR_2_01116	Moved out, what, maybe five\nyears back?
ACR_2_01117	The house has been vacant\never since.
ACR_2_01120	So what's this rumor you\nmentioned?
ACR_2_01121	What do people say about this\nold boathouse?
ACR_2_01122	That it's haunted.
ACR_2_01123	Haunted? Really?
ACR_2_01124	It's just a story but not all\nthat surprising.
ACR_2_01125	Why? Did something happen?
ACR_2_01126	Oh, it's just...
ACR_2_01128	*clatter*
ACR_2_01129	What was that?
ACR_2_01130	I should check it out.
ACR_2_01132	Matthew, what are you doing?
ACR_2_01135	Why did the clock stop?
ACR_2_01136	The family that owns it kept it in\nworking order for generations.
ACR_2_01137	But five years ago, the last\nsurviving member stopped it.
ACR_2_01138	Sealed it up tight so no one\ncould get in.
ACR_2_01139	They were getting old as it was,\nand then, after the incident...
ACR_2_01140	What happened?
ACR_2_01141	It's nothing. Just an old story.
ACR_2_01143	I want to know what happened,\nbut now isn't the best time...
ACR_2_01146	That's my phone.
ACR_2_01147	Oh, uh, I need to get back.
ACR_2_01148	See ya, Ashley. Don't come in\nhere again, OK?
ACR_2_01278	Uh... Matthew?
ACR_2_01279	Where'd you go?
ACR_2_01284	The well's so deep... How can I\nget him out?
ACR_2_01285	No way I can reach all the way\ndown there.
ACR_2_01286	Come on, hurry up and get me\noutta here!
ACR_2_01287	Can you climb up the wall?
ACR_2_01288	There's nothing to grab on to.
ACR_2_01290	Got it. Just a minute.
ACR_2_01297	There's a rope up here, but it\nlooks too short.
ACR_2_01298	Why'd you decide to hide in a\nwell, anyway?
ACR_2_01299	I thought it would be a good idea!
ACR_2_01300	Well how's that working out\nfor you? How'd you even get\ndown there?
ACR_2_01301	I climbed down a rope that was\nhanging from up there.
ACR_2_01302	I made it down part of the way,\nbut then it snapped...and I fell.
ACR_2_01303	A professional spelunker, huh?
ACR_2_01304	Can you throw your part of the\nrope up to me?
ACR_2_01305	I'll tie it off up here.
ACR_2_01306	It's too dark. I can't find a thing\ndown here.
ACR_2_01307	I could probably find it if I had\nsome light.
ACR_2_01308	Got it. Just a minute.
ACR_2_01310	Why'd you decide to hide in a\nwell, anyway?
ACR_2_01311	I thought it would be a good idea!
ACR_2_01312	Well how's that working out\nfor you? How'd you even get\ndown there?
ACR_2_01313	I climbed down a rope that was\nhanging from up there.
ACR_2_01314	I made it down part of the way,\nbut then it snapped...and I fell.
ACR_2_01315	A professional spelunker, huh?
ACR_2_01316	Can you throw your part of the\nrope up to me?
ACR_2_01317	I'll tie it off up here.
ACR_2_01318	It's too dark. I can't find a thing\ndown here.
ACR_2_01319	I could probably find it if I had\nsome light.
ACR_2_01320	Hmm... Some light...
ACR_2_01324	Can you see now?
ACR_2_01325	Yeah! And I found the rope!
ACR_2_01326	OK, great. Now toss it to me and\nI'll grab it.
ACR_2_01327	Here it comes.
ACR_2_01328	Hup!
ACR_2_01330	I should be able to tie this off\nsomewhere then drop it back in.
ACR_2_01332	Can you reach the rope?
ACR_2_01333	Yeah! Got it!
ACR_2_01334	Good. Now can you climb up?
ACR_2_01335	Uhhh... Y-yeah, I think so!
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00001	Old tools lie on the shelf.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00005	Hey, a flashlight! I can use this\nto light up the inside of the well!
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00007	Huh? It isn't turning on...
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00015	Maybe these batteries will work.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00129	The box has batteries in it.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00018	It actually works! Nice!
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00019	Now I can use this to light\nup the well!
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00020	Crud. It still won't turn on.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00130	The battery slots into the helmet.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00131	Crud... It still doesn't work.\nSo much for that idea.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00023	Maybe this'll work...
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00132	There's a battery next to the\nhelmet too.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00024	It might work if I can just\nconnect this...
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00027	The fuel cans are empty.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00029	There are fuel cans on the shelf.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00031	Hey, a lantern! I can use this to\nlight up the inside of the well!
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00032	But I don't have anything to\nlight it with...
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00034	There's a dusty lantern on the shelf.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00037	The cans are empty...
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00038	There are some oil cans on the shelf.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00040	These are for camping.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00041	But they're out of fuel, so they\nwon't light up.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00042	There are two gas stoves on the shelf.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00044	Bottles...all empty.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00045	There are some empty bottles in a box.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00046	Crud! It's out of batteries!
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00047	If I can just find some batteries...
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00048	No batteries in here...
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00065	I need some light...
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00076	Hey! I found a flashlight in that\nabandoned building!
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00077	Really?
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00078	Yeah, just sit tight, and I'll have\nthe light on in a second.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00080	Hurry! It's so dark down here!
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00133	All right, I'm turning the light on.\nJust hang on.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00081	Ready? I'm going to turn it on.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00082	Ready!
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00083	Hm. It won't turn on.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00084	What's going on? Hurry up and\nturn the light on!
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00085	What to do, what to do...
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00086	Just hang tight down there for\na little longer.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00087	Seriously? Come on!
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00088	Why won't it turn on?
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00089	Are the batteries dead?
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00109	I'm going to need something else\nto light the well up...
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00110	Hey, sorry! It'll be just a little\nlonger, all right?
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00111	Uh... I guess so!
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00112	Just, please... Hurry, so I can use\nthat rope to get out of here!
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00114	Looks like this rope snapped.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00115	There's a rope tied to the tree.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00117	Huh. If this rope is snapped...
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00118	This must be the rope that kid\ntried to use.
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00119	Maybe if I retie the rope to\nthe tree...
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00121	If I retie the rope here, then...
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00122	Nice! I should be able to get him\nout of the well now!
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00123	I don't think I'll be able to tie\nthis to the tree...
ACR_Mystery_2_1_00128	Ugh. I can't just leave him...\nThat kid needs my help!
ACR_Mystery_2_2_00001	I should go check the boathouse.
ACR_Mystery_2_2_00002	I should go check the boathouse.
ACR_Mystery_2_2_00003	The RAS is reacting\nto something.
ACR_Mystery_2_2_00047	This is just like what happened\nback at the guesthouse. Hmm...
ACR_Mystery_2_2_00048	All right. Let's try this again...
ACR_Mystery_2_2_00049	Dang. This is harder than\nI thought.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00002	Is that a...briefcase? I wonder\nwhere it came from.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00004	Wait—that looks just like the\nbriefcase my dad used to use!
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00005	We should drag it in and see\nwhat's inside!
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00008	We need some kind of tool, right?\nLet's check the boat house.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00009	Good idea!
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00011	It's a remote-control boat!\nMaybe we can use this!
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00031	How can we get that briefcase\nout of the water?
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00032	Not sure this will help...
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00033	All right, let's try using what we\nfound to pull the briefcase\ntoward us!
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00034	Let's try using the remote-\ncontrolled boat to get\nthe briefcase!
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00040	Hey, a fishing rod! Maybe we can\nuse this...
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00041	Oh, maybe not... It's broken.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00042	There's a broken fishing rod.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00044	It's dry... Did someone forget\nto clean all this up?
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00045	Painting tools lie on the floor.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00047	Hm... I don't think there's any\nway we can use this.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00048	There's paint on the shelf.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00050	I probably shouldn't go around\nopening sealed cardboard boxes.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00051	There are some cardboard boxes on the shelf.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00053	These canisters look empty...
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00054	There are a few canisters on the shelf.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00056	We could try to lasso it! But this\nmight not be long enough...
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00057	There's a piece of rope on the floor.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00059	I don't think this will be able\nto reach.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00060	Two poles lean against the wall.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00072	Was this being repaired?
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00073	There's a broken boat.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00075	Do these shutters open?
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00076	Doesn't look like it...
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00077	The shutters are closed.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00079	This window doesn't open. Hmm.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00080	There's a window.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00082	Could I get the briefcase with\nan oar? Probably not, huh...
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00083	There's a collection of oars.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00086	Hey! Don't just leave!
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00087	That's the wrong way!
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00089	I wonder if I could throw this life\npreserver onto the briefcase...
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00090	Urgh... It's too heavy to throw.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00091	There are life preservers scattered around.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00093	Figures a boat house would have\nthese available.
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00094	But only six? That doesn't seem\nlike enough, does it?
ACR_Mystery_2_3_00095	There are six life vests put away on the shelf.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00002	And of course it won't open...
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00003	I can mess with this all I want,\nbut without the combination,\nthere's not much point.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00004	There has to be some way, right?
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00005	The briefcase is locked with a combination.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00006	An eight-digit code, huh...
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00008	Looks like the briefcase\nis still wet.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00010	The briefcase is still wet.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00011	There's no way we'll ever get\nthis open, Matthew.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00012	We don't have any way to figure\nout eight random numbers...
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00037	Hmm... Eight numbers...
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00015	Oh, I know!
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00016	My dad used to talk about some\nnumbers he always remembered.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00038	He told me when we came to\nthis boat house before.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00017	He called them his lucky numbers,\nand there were eight of them!
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00039	That must be it!
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00040	Maybe we can find out more\nabout them if we look around!
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00041	I hope we find something!
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00020	Fishing banned until 8/21/2005.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00021	This looks like a pamphlet for\nthe boat house.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00022	There's an article with an image of the\nwinner of 1999's 26th lottery round.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00042	Ashley...
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00043	This is my dad.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00023	So your dad really did win the\nlottery, didn't he?
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00024	Mr. Crusoe exclaims:
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00025	"The winning numbers were just the numbers\nthat spell my name on a phone, then my age!"
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00026	"Incredible that these numbers worked. I guess\nthey're all my lucky numbers now!"
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00063	There's an article with a picture of the winner\nof 1999's 26th lottery.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00064	Mr. Crusoe exclaims:
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00065	"The winning numbers were just the numbers\nthat spell my name on a phone, then my age!"
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00066	"Incredible that these numbers worked. I guess\nthey're all my lucky numbers now!"
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00028	There are some numbers here...
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00029	New Record\n34.57 lb. King Salmon
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00030	by Michael Crusoe\nJune 25th, 1989
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00031	There's a piece of paper pinned to the\nbulletin board.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00032	It's a list of winning lottery numbers from 1999,\nfrom the 21st lottery round to the 30th.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00033	This lottery ticket looks old.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00061	There's a piece of paper pinned to the\nbulletin board.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00062	It's a list of winning lottery numbers from 1999,\nfrom the 21st lottery round to the 30th.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00034	It won't open.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00035	What could his lucky numbers be?
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00036	We need to keep looking for the\nlock's combination.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00044	Huh, I didn't know you used to be\nable to fish in the lake...
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00045	There's a poster notifying people about a\nfishing ban.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00046	Some visitors left notes.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00047	"Landed some real lunkers!" and\n"I'll be back next year!" Huh. Fun!
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00048	Previous visitors left messages.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00049	Is this some sort of fish burger?
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00050	Is this place still around? I kinda\nwanna check it out...
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00051	There's a flyer for a restaurant.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00052	This says how many people are\nallowed on a boat.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00053	These are rules for renting the boats.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00054	Cleaning service: 9 AM\nTrash pickup: Fridays
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00055	Looks like a note.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00056	There is a note on the board.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00057	"Sea Serpent in Lake Juliet? Shadow Looms\nLarge on the Lake!"
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00058	Sea serpents? Seriously? No way\nI'm believing that.
ACR_Mystery_2_4_00059	The article shows a picture of a large shadow\nin middle of the lake.
ACR_3_Scenario_00084	There's Dan on the phone.\nMatthew probably didn't\ngo that way.
ACR_3_Scenario_00085	Dan's over that way, so Matthew\nis probably keeping his distance.
ACR_3_Scenario_00011	I thought maybe he came\nback here.
ACR_3_Scenario_00012	But I guess I was wrong.
ACR_3_Scenario_00086	Is this that photographer's house\nDan told me about?
ACR_3_Scenario_00016	Hello? Anyone in here?
ACR_3_Scenario_00017	Sounds like no one's home.
ACR_3_Scenario_00090	Those two are my parents.\nMichael and Emily.
ACR_3_Scenario_00091	And that one near Mom is...
ACR_3_Scenario_00092	That's you, right? You're so little!
ACR_3_Scenario_00093	So then the girl on your dad's\nback is your little sister Kelly?
ACR_3_Scenario_00094	Yeah.
ACR_3_Scenario_00079	Elizabeth?
ACR_3_Scenario_00078	Huh?
ACR_3_Scenario_00019	What?
ACR_3_Scenario_00087	I wonder if Matthew's all right...\nI should check on him.
ACR_3_Scenario_00088	There he is...
ACR_3_Scenario_00089	I need to go to the clock tower\nbefore we go to Dad's cottage.
ACR_3_Scenario_00020	You go ahead to the clock tower.\nI'll wait here.
ACR_3_Scenario_00021	Sorry that I can't go with you...
ACR_3_Scenario_00027	It's locked. It won't open.
ACR_3_Scenario_00095	Matthew seems upset by the\nclock tower... We should stay\naway from it for now.
ACR_3_Scenario_00096	Dad's cottage is just past the\ncovered bridge.
ACR_3_Scenario_00028	It should be on the left just\npast the covered bridge, so...
ACR_3_Scenario_00029	This must be the wrong place.
ACR_3_Scenario_00030	It should be on the left just\npast the covered bridge, so...
ACR_3_Scenario_00031	I must have gone too far.
ACR_3_Scenario_00032	I guess this is Dad's cottage.
ACR_3_Scenario_00034	He left it unlocked? Kind of\nunsafe, Dad...
ACR_3_Scenario_00035	I need to check out the floppy\ndisk with Matthew.
ACR_3_Scenario_00036	He said there's a computer in\nupstairs, right?
ACR_3_Scenario_00083	Is it OK to just let it ring?
ACR_3_Scenario_00043	I should answer the phone.
ACR_3_01175	I wonder what exactly happened\nhere five years ago...
ACR_3_01176	Did it have something to do\nwith Matthew's dad?
ACR_3_01177	Could that be the reason\nhe disappeared?
ACR_3_00003	I need to find Matthew.
ACR_3_01179	Where could he be?
ACR_3_01180	What'd Dan say about where\nMatthew went last year?
ACR_3_01181	Something about finding Matthew\nin an old house near here? Hm...
ACR_3_01346	The door's open...
ACR_3_01347	Is Matthew in here?
ACR_3_00007	What's this?
ACR_3_00009	Looks like Matthew's\ndad's briefcase.
ACR_3_00010	Matthew's gotta be around here.
ACR_3_00017	A trap door?
ACR_3_00022	Looks like stairs down to\nthe basement...
ACR_3_00023	I should check it out.
ACR_3_00032	Matthew?
ACR_3_00034	Oh. Ashley.
ACR_3_00035	I've been trying to find you!
ACR_3_00036	How'd you know I'd be here?
ACR_3_00037	Dan gave me the idea.
ACR_3_00038	He said this is where they found\nyou when you ran away last time.
ACR_3_00040	You didn't tell him you'd seen\nme, did you?
ACR_3_00041	Does he know I'm here?
ACR_3_00043	Of course not. Don't worry.
ACR_3_00044	He's looking for you though.
ACR_3_00045	He said he'd take you to the\npolice if he found you.
ACR_3_00050	This is a great spot to lay low.\nBasement hideout's a nice touch.
ACR_3_00051	How'd you find this place?
ACR_3_00052	Some construction worker told\nme about it last year.
ACR_3_00053	Said a photographer used to\nlive here.
ACR_3_00054	He'd take pictures of the lake\nall the time.
ACR_3_00055	But one day, he just disappeared.\nLeft all his stuff too.
ACR_3_00056	Huh. That's strange.
ACR_3_00063	Huh?
ACR_3_00066	Hey, is this you in this picture?
ACR_3_00068	Yeah. That's my family.
ACR_3_00069	I found it here last year.
ACR_3_00070	Oh... Huh.
ACR_3_00079	Is that the stuffed animal that\nwas in the briefcase?
ACR_3_00080	Yeah. Kelly loved that <color=#00994CFF>stuffed\nbunny</color>. She took it everywhere.
ACR_3_00081	It's a great picture. You all look\nso happy.
ACR_3_00082	Yeah... We were. We were\nreally happy...
ACR_3_00083	Kelly and I laughed and played,\nand our parents laughed with us.
ACR_3_00090	Um...Ashley...
ACR_3_00091	He'll call the police. And they'll\ntake me back to my uncle!
ACR_3_00092	If Dan asks, please don't tell him\nwhere I am.
ACR_3_00093	And I <color=#00994CFF>never want to go\nback</color> there again!
ACR_3_00095	Look, Matthew...
ACR_3_00096	I understand how you feel.
ACR_3_00097	But you can't keep going like this.
ACR_3_00098	Hmph.
ACR_3_00106	So this stuffed bunny's Kelly's?
ACR_3_00107	What was it doing in the\nbriefcase, I wonder...
ACR_3_00108	Yeah, I have no idea.
ACR_3_00109	Why don't you hold on to it?
ACR_3_00110	Might help cheer you up if you're\never feeling lonely...
ACR_3_00112	What do you think?
ACR_3_00113	Ehh...
ACR_3_00115	No... You hang on to it.
ACR_3_00116	Come on. You should have it.
ACR_3_00117	I...
ACR_3_00119	I said no!
ACR_3_00120	Huh?
ACR_3_00123	Fine!
ACR_3_00124	Then I'll go with Ashley!
ACR_3_00134	Why don't you want to go back\nto your uncle?
ACR_3_00135	You know...my dad went missing\nfor years before too.
ACR_3_00136	I lived with my aunt the whole\ntime he was gone. I get it.
ACR_3_00137	So, I can tell you one thing\nfor sure...
ACR_3_00138	Your uncle must be really\nworried about you right now.
ACR_3_00139	No way!
ACR_3_00140	He's not worried at all!
ACR_3_00141	Matthew...
ACR_3_00142	He hates me.
ACR_3_00143	Trust me!
ACR_3_00144	He was going to send me to\n<color=#00994CFF>boarding school</color>!
ACR_3_00176	Boarding school? What would\nthat mean for you?
ACR_3_00177	He's sending me to some school\nin London—in September.
ACR_3_00178	London...like in England?!
ACR_3_00179	Yeah.
ACR_3_00180	That's basically the other side\nof the world!
ACR_3_00181	I know.
ACR_3_00182	He said I need to learn how to be\na "responsible adult."
ACR_3_00183	But they have all these rules, and\nI have to live at the school too.
ACR_3_00184	I won't be able to come home\nuntil I graduate.
ACR_3_00185	That's awful.
ACR_3_00186	So I didn't have a choice.
ACR_3_00187	I needed to run away. This is my\nlast chance to find my dad.
ACR_3_00188	If I get caught again, I'll never\nbe able to come back.
ACR_3_00189	I had no idea...
ACR_3_00190	OK. I'll help you.
ACR_3_00191	What?
ACR_3_00192	You want to find out what\nhappened to your dad, right?
ACR_3_00193	Let me help you. We'll do it\ntogether.
ACR_3_00194	Really?
ACR_3_00195	Absolutely.
ACR_3_00196	Thanks, Ashley!
ACR_3_00197	There is one thing though. If we\ndon't get anywhere today...
ACR_3_00198	you have to go back to your\nuncle, at least for now.
ACR_3_00199	What? Why?!
ACR_3_00200	Think about it. Let's say you keep\nlooking for your dad.
ACR_3_00201	What happens if you never find\na lead?
ACR_3_00202	Well...
ACR_3_00203	What will you do?
ACR_3_00204	I'll keep looking!
ACR_3_00205	You'll just keep looking forever?
ACR_3_00206	That's right. I'll never give up!
ACR_3_00207	If that's how you feel, why not\ntalk to your uncle about it?
ACR_3_00208	Tell him how serious you are.
ACR_3_00209	I'm sure he'll understand.
ACR_3_00210	*sigh* OK...
ACR_3_00211	Promise?
ACR_3_00212	Yeah...
ACR_3_00215	OK. Then let's start our search.
ACR_3_00216	OK.
ACR_3_00345	Our first stop should be my\ndad's cottage.
ACR_3_00348	I've been thinking about how to\nread the disk from the briefcase.
ACR_3_00349	I bet we can check it out there.
ACR_3_00350	Don't you think he'll report me?
ACR_3_00351	Don't worry. He's at the lab.
ACR_3_00352	You're sure?
ACR_3_00353	Yup. Positive. Let's go.
ACR_3_00354	Yeah... OK.
ACR_3_00356	I can take the briefcase.
ACR_3_00358	Got it.
ACR_3_00359	Not too heavy?
ACR_3_00360	Nope. I'm good.
ACR_3_00361	I carried it this far, didn't I?
ACR_3_00362	All right. It's all yours.
ACR_3_00363	Let's go.
ACR_3_00371	What's with the face?
ACR_3_00372	Do you have a problem with me?
ACR_3_00373	Not at all. Just surprised.
ACR_3_00374	I didn't expect to see you\nout here.
ACR_3_00375	Uh-huh.
ACR_3_00376	What are you doing here?
ACR_3_00378	What do you mean?
ACR_3_00379	Why would you ask me that?
ACR_3_00380	It's none of your business.
ACR_3_00382	Calm down. I was just making\nsmall talk.
ACR_3_00383	It doesn't take much to set\nyou off, does it?
ACR_3_00384	I didn't mean it like that.
ACR_3_00385	I was just...taking a walk.
ACR_3_00386	Am I not allowed to go for\n<color=#00994CFF>a walk</color>?
ACR_3_00387	Is that so...
ACR_3_00389	Let's go, Ashley.
ACR_3_00391	Wait...
ACR_3_00392	What?
ACR_3_00393	Ugh, I knew it.
ACR_3_00394	You're that <color=#00994CFF>Crusoe Resort kid</color>.
ACR_3_00395	...
ACR_3_00401	Do you take solo walks often?
ACR_3_00402	Sometimes. I guess.
ACR_3_00403	Sounds relaxing. Any good\ntrails around here?
ACR_3_00404	Trails? Ha.
ACR_3_00405	No such thing.
ACR_3_00406	Really? You're local. I thought\nyou'd know.
ACR_3_00407	Oh, by the way, I saw Tommy and\nJanet earlier.
ACR_3_00408	They said they were headed\nto band practice.
ACR_3_00409	Are you going?
ACR_3_00410	What?
ACR_3_00412	Uh, right...
ACR_3_00413	I've gotta skip this one. Errands\nto run.
ACR_3_00414	Oh. That's too bad.
ACR_3_00417	You know Matthew?
ACR_3_00418	Of course.
ACR_3_00419	Everyone around here does.
ACR_3_00420	He's the son of the president of\nCrusoe Resort.
ACR_3_00423	What's with the attitude?
ACR_3_00424	So what if he's the president's\nson?
ACR_3_00425	You clearly have no idea, so I'll\nenlighten you.
ACR_3_00426	You should know about \nCrusoe Resort.
ACR_3_00427	After all, they almost ruined\nthe lake.
ACR_3_00428	Ruined the lake?
ACR_3_00429	Yeah. And it was his dad's fault.
ACR_3_00430	First the jerk finds this\nbeautiful lake.
ACR_3_00431	Then he buys up all the land he\ncan to make this big resort.
ACR_3_00432	So?
ACR_3_00433	It's how he went about it.
ACR_3_00434	The construction ruined the\nenvironment here.
ACR_3_00435	They totally polluted the lake.
ACR_3_00438	Hmph.
ACR_3_00439	Some people would do anything\nfor money.
ACR_3_00440	Destroying nature to build a\ntourist trap? Unbelievable.
ACR_3_00441	Selfish people like that are the\nreason the earth is hurting.
ACR_3_00443	Oh, poor Mother Nature!
ACR_3_00444	*sigh*
ACR_3_00445	Get it? That's the kind of person\nhis dad is.
ACR_3_00446	That's enough, Elizabeth.
ACR_3_00447	I'm just telling the truth.
ACR_3_00448	Even if that's true...
ACR_3_00449	it has nothing to do with\nMatthew.
ACR_3_00452	Seriously? How can you walk\naround like nothing's wrong?
ACR_3_00454	You don't...
ACR_3_00456	I don't what?
ACR_3_00458	You don't have any proof!\nStop lying!
ACR_3_00460	Matthew?!
ACR_3_00469	Whatever.
ACR_3_00473	Hey.
ACR_3_00474	*sigh*
ACR_3_00475	Are you OK?
ACR_3_00476	What do you think about what\nElizabeth said?
ACR_3_00477	I think she didn't have to be\nso rude.
ACR_3_00478	She kinda made me mad.
ACR_3_00479	So you were...shocked?
ACR_3_00480	Well, yeah... A little.
ACR_3_00481	Do you know if...if that's true?
ACR_3_00482	Everyone says it is.
ACR_3_00483	But you don't believe it.
ACR_3_00484	No.
ACR_3_00485	But I get confused sometimes.\nI can't help but wonder if...
ACR_3_00492	I've been here before.\nWith my family.
ACR_3_00493	Oh yeah? It's huge.
ACR_3_00494	Yeah... This is a <color=#00994CFF>special tree</color>.
ACR_3_00495	I remember Dad used to stand\nhere and look out at the lake.
ACR_3_00496	He always seemed so calm...
ACR_3_00497	You remember.
ACR_3_00498	I just thought Dad liked the view.
ACR_3_00499	Then everything happened, and\nnow I'm not so sure...
ACR_3_00500	What was he thinking about when\nhe stared out at the lake?
ACR_3_00501	That's something I wonder\nabout now.
ACR_3_00511	It sounds like this tree's\nimportant to you.
ACR_3_00512	Yeah. I have so many memories\nof all of us together here.
ACR_3_00513	What was your family like?
ACR_3_00514	Dad was always busy working.
ACR_3_00515	When I'd ask him to play, he'd\nyell about being interrupted.
ACR_3_00516	Oh...
ACR_3_00517	Mom was always sick, so I used\nto take care of Kelly.
ACR_3_00518	We played together all the time.
ACR_3_00519	Kelly was cute, but she was a lot\nyounger. She cried a lot.
ACR_3_00520	Being a big brother must\nbe tough sometimes.
ACR_3_00521	Yeah.
ACR_3_00522	...Hey, Matthew?
ACR_3_00523	Does Kelly live with your\nuncle too?
ACR_3_00524	No...
ACR_3_00525	My uncle said she went to stay\nsomeplace a long way from here.
ACR_3_00526	I don't get to see her.
ACR_3_00527	That sounds really lonely.
ACR_3_00528	Yeah.
ACR_3_00534	Honestly...I just don't remember.
ACR_3_00535	I can't even remember the day\nmy dad left.
ACR_3_00536	When I try, everything\ngets fuzzy.
ACR_3_00537	It's all a blank.
ACR_3_00538	Not the last thing he said\nbefore he left...
ACR_3_00539	or the look on his face.
ACR_3_00542	Seeing Matthew like this reminds\nme so much of D.
ACR_3_00545	Something terrible must have\nhappened to Matthew...
ACR_3_00546	Something that left a scar inside.\nJust like with D.
ACR_3_00550	Listen...
ACR_3_00551	When I learned about my mom,\na friend told me something.
ACR_3_00552	He said, even though facing the\ntruth can be hard... In the end,\nit's always for the best.
ACR_3_00557	What do you think?
ACR_3_00559	You're right.
ACR_3_00560	I need to know what Dad was\nthinking.
ACR_3_00561	That's why I have to find out\nwhat happened to him.
ACR_3_01204	The clock tower...
ACR_3_01355	You want to check it out next?
ACR_3_00637	Let's take a look. Might\nfind something.
ACR_3_00655	So let's go. What are you\nwaiting for?
ACR_3_00656	Nothing, I guess.
ACR_3_01206	Oh, wow.
ACR_3_01207	It's so much taller up close!
ACR_3_01356	(Exert noise)
ACR_3_01208	Promise me, Matthew.
ACR_3_01209	Don't go near the clock tower.
ACR_3_01357	(Exert noise)
ACR_3_00661	Ashley.
ACR_3_00662	Yeah?
ACR_3_00663	I changed my mind. I don't\nwanna go.
ACR_3_00664	I just...have a really bad feeling.
ACR_3_00665	It's OK.
ACR_3_00666	You don't want to go,\nthat's fine.
ACR_3_00667	I'm really sorry.
ACR_3_00668	Why don't you wait here while\nI take a look?
ACR_3_00669	Just don't let Dan find you.
ACR_3_00670	OK.
ACR_3_01352	Hey, you!
ACR_3_00679	That was Matthew just now,\nwasn't it?
ACR_3_00680	Is he after Matthew?
ACR_3_00681	Do you have a moment?
ACR_3_00682	Um, sure.
ACR_3_00684	But can I ask you a\nquestion first?
ACR_3_00685	Go ahead.
ACR_3_00686	How do you know about\nMatthew?
ACR_3_00687	Not just Matthew. I know about\nyou too...
ACR_3_00688	Ashley Mizuki Robins.
ACR_3_00690	The only child of Dr. Richard\nRobins.
ACR_3_00689	What?
ACR_3_00691	How'd you know that?!
ACR_3_00692	A good question.
ACR_3_00693	Who are you?
ACR_3_00694	John Smith.
ACR_3_00696	Seriously? John Smith?
ACR_3_00697	There is no way that's your\nreal name.
ACR_3_00698	Is that what you think?
ACR_3_00700	What's this guy hiding? He's\nseriously suspicious.
ACR_3_00701	Ahh, the look of total mistrust of\nadults on the face of youth...
ACR_3_00702	And seriously weird.
ACR_3_00704	I'll tell you this much... I am not\nyour enemy.
ACR_3_00705	Um.
ACR_3_00706	I've always wanted to use\nthat line.
ACR_3_00707	I literally could not imagine a\nmore suspicious person if I tried.
ACR_3_00708	Hey now! Have mercy.
ACR_3_00709	OK, let's just cut the jokes. I'm\nnot falling for whatever this is.
ACR_3_00710	How do you know about us?
ACR_3_00711	Who are you really?
ACR_3_00714	Now what are you doing?
ACR_3_00715	Checking our perimeter.
ACR_3_00717	Can you keep a secret, Ashley?
ACR_3_00718	Usually.
ACR_3_00719	You cannot repeat what I am\nabout to tell you.
ACR_3_00721	The truth is...
ACR_3_00723	I'm a special agent. I'm looking\ninto something that happened\nfive years ago.
ACR_3_00724	A special agent?
ACR_3_00725	You look surprised.
ACR_3_00726	I know, I know. Hearing "special\nagent" can be quite the shock.
ACR_3_00728	Actually, I'm more interested in\nwhat happened five years ago.
ACR_3_00729	That's what got your attention?
ACR_3_00730	It has something to do with\nMatthew's dad, doesn't it?
ACR_3_00731	Tell me what you know. Please.
ACR_3_00733	Ashley...
ACR_3_00734	Did Matthew tell you what\nhappened five years ago?
ACR_3_00735	Huh? Why?
ACR_3_00736	What does he have to do with\ninvestigating the resort and\nthe lake?
ACR_3_00738	That's confidential.
ACR_3_00739	Information regarding the\ninvestigation is classified.
ACR_3_00740	Then I won't tell you anything.\nI'll conduct my own investigation.
ACR_3_00742	I would stop if I were you.
ACR_3_00743	Why?
ACR_3_00744	In this world, certain truths are\nbetter left undiscovered.
ACR_3_00745	Would you pass that message on\nto Matthew as well?
ACR_3_00746	Me?
ACR_3_00747	Tell him for me, Ashley.
ACR_3_00750	Hmm...
ACR_3_00751	Special agent, huh?
ACR_3_00780	Ah!
ACR_3_00783	Ashley, see that clock tower?
ACR_3_00784	Your dad and I once went all\nthe way to the top.
ACR_3_00789	I remember...
ACR_3_00791	It used to be open to everyone.
ACR_3_01215	I wonder if I can get in.
ACR_3_01217	Nope... Not opening.
ACR_3_01218	And if I can't get in, I can't\ninvestigate.
ACR_3_00798	Matthew!
ACR_3_00799	*rustle*
ACR_3_00800	*bark*
ACR_3_01221	Oh, it's you! I saw you at the\nguesthouse.
ACR_3_01222	Woof!
ACR_3_01223	Ashley!
ACR_3_00802	There you are.
ACR_3_00803	I saw you talking to the guy in\nthe sunglasses.
ACR_3_00806	Is everything OK?
ACR_3_00807	Yeah. We just talked. I\nquestioned him a little.
ACR_3_00808	Wow, really? Awesome!
ACR_3_00809	It's no big deal.
ACR_3_00810	What did you find out?
ACR_3_00811	He didn't say who he was, but he\ntold me what he's doing here.
ACR_3_00812	He's investigating what happened\nfive years ago.
ACR_3_00813	Huh?
ACR_3_00814	He wouldn't give details. Said it\nwas top secret.
ACR_3_00815	That's so sketchy! What if he's\nbehind it?
ACR_3_00816	I'm not sure. He was odd, but it\ndidn't seem like he was up to\nno good.
ACR_3_00818	*bark*
ACR_3_00819	Hi, puppy! Good to see you!
ACR_3_00822	Now where did you come from?
ACR_3_00823	Let's try to guess your name.\nUm... Bonnie? Rusty? Pochi?
ACR_3_00824	That last one's too weird.
ACR_3_00825	It's not weird!
ACR_3_00826	Pochi is a very common dog\nname in Japan.
ACR_3_00827	Huh. That's really a Japanese\ndog name?
ACR_3_00828	Yep. My dad told me.
ACR_3_00829	Does your dad know a lot\nabout Japan?
ACR_3_00830	Sort of. My mom was Japanese.
ACR_3_00831	Oh, cool.
ACR_3_00832	But this dog's name definitely\nisn't Pochi. It's Princess.
ACR_3_00833	I saw it on her collar.
ACR_3_00834	*bark*
ACR_3_00835	You sure do seem like a princess.
ACR_3_00836	Are you a dog or a cat person?
ACR_3_00837	Definitely a dog person.
ACR_3_00838	I wanted one when I was little,\nbut we lived in an apartment.
ACR_3_00839	So I used to play with my\nneighbor's dog after school\ninstead.
ACR_3_00840	Really?
ACR_3_00841	Hey, Princess. Wanna be friends?
ACR_3_00843	*bark*
ACR_3_01228	Hey, so...
ACR_3_00845	How was the clock tower?
ACR_3_00846	It was locked. I couldn't get in.
ACR_3_00847	Oh...
ACR_3_00848	Come to think of it, Dan told me\nsomething.
ACR_3_01229	He said the clock's been stopped\nfor five years now.
ACR_3_01230	I guess that means we can't\nget inside.
ACR_3_00857	Oh well... So where's your dad's\ncottage?
ACR_3_00858	I think it was just past the bridge,\nfirst house on the left.
ACR_3_00859	Let's go!
ACR_3_00860	Sure thing.
ACR_3_00863	It's locked?
ACR_3_00864	Dad's place is on the other side\nof the bridge.
ACR_3_00865	This isn't good...
ACR_3_01233	Nice, it opened!
ACR_3_01234	Huh? Where'd Princess go?
ACR_3_01235	Ran off somewhere.
ACR_3_01236	Aw...
ACR_3_01237	Maybe we'll see her again.
ACR_3_01360	(Exert Noise)
ACR_3_01242	It's just issue after issue...\nHow strange.
ACR_3_01243	It looks like unauthorized\naccess from outside the\nJ.C. Valley system.
ACR_3_01244	It can't be...
ACR_3_00897	You're sure your dad isn't here?
ACR_3_00898	Definitely. Don't worry.
ACR_3_01247	Where's the computer?
ACR_3_01248	I'll look for it.
ACR_3_00899	Ashley!
ACR_3_00900	D-Dad? What are you\ndoing here?
ACR_3_00901	I wrapped up at the lab.
ACR_3_00902	I'm sorry I had to leave the\ncookout so abruptly.
ACR_3_01249	You said he wouldn't be here!
ACR_3_01250	It's fine. I'll cover for you.
ACR_3_01252	You left your hat.
ACR_3_01254	Oh, there it is...
ACR_3_01255	Thanks for bringing it to me.
ACR_3_00905	You have a friend with you?
ACR_3_00908	Oh, uh, yeah.
ACR_3_00909	This is, uh...Mario.
ACR_3_00910	Yep. Mario.
ACR_3_00913	Mario, eh?
ACR_3_00915	It's OK. Let me get a good\nlook at you.
ACR_3_00917	Now, could you be the kid Dan\ntold me about?
ACR_3_00918	No, Dad! No way!
ACR_3_00920	Uh...
ACR_3_00923	Don't be afraid.
ACR_3_00924	You must be Matthew.
ACR_3_00926	Huh?
ACR_3_00927	I heard you ran away from home.\nYou must be having a hard time.
ACR_3_00928	I was about your age when I ran\naway for the first time.
ACR_3_00930	Will you tell me what's going on,\nMatthew?
ACR_3_00932	Uh, sure.
ACR_3_00935	I didn't see this coming.
ACR_3_00936	Was Dad always like this?
ACR_3_00938	So I only have today to figure\nout what happened to my dad.
ACR_3_00939	I see. You've been through a lot.
ACR_3_00940	Please don't tell Dan\nabout Matthew.
ACR_3_00941	Don't worry.
ACR_3_00942	Any friend of yours is a friend\nof mine.
ACR_3_00943	Thanks, Dad.
ACR_3_00944	I hope you find a lead soon.
ACR_3_00945	Yeah.
ACR_3_00947	Ashley, your dad is different\nfrom how I expected.
ACR_3_00948	Yeah. I don't think my dad is\nwhat you'd call "normal."
ACR_3_00950	Huh? Not normal?
ACR_3_00952	Don't you get it? That was\na compliment.
ACR_3_00953	It was?
ACR_3_00956	You two are actually\npretty similar.
ACR_3_00957	Are not!
ACR_3_00959	Ahem, well. How was the cookout,\nAshley?
ACR_3_00960	Awkward. I didn't know anyone.
ACR_3_00961	Right... I'm sorry about that.
ACR_3_00975	But I met someone who\nknew Mom.
ACR_3_00976	He said on the outside I look like\nMom, but inside I'm more like you.
ACR_3_00978	Is that right?
ACR_3_00979	I don't really get what he meant.
ACR_3_00980	I don't even know you that well.
ACR_3_00982	Is that right...
ACR_3_00984	Oh, before I forget. Can you\nlook at this?
ACR_3_00985	It belonged to Matthew's dad.
ACR_3_00987	Wow, it's been a while since I've\nseen a floppy disk.
ACR_3_00988	My computer's upstairs. There's\na floppy drive around there\nsomewhere...if you can find it.
ACR_3_00989	Feel free to look around.
ACR_3_00990	Wow. Thanks!
ACR_3_00992	I'll start looking!
ACR_3_00997	I remembered something else\nabout Mom.
ACR_3_00998	Did you?
ACR_3_00999	Yeah. Sometimes the scenery\nhere reminds me of things.
ACR_3_01002	You're remembering things?
ACR_3_01003	It's possible something happened\n13 years ago...
ACR_3_01004	Something that stuck deep in\nher memory.
ACR_3_01006	Why did I suddenly remember\nMom?
ACR_3_01007	Well...
ACR_3_01008	Do you know something?
ACR_3_01010	I've been thinking.
ACR_3_01011	On the night your mom died...
ACR_3_01012	she had just returned with you\nfrom Lake Juliet.
ACR_3_01013	I've analyzed that day over\nand over.
ACR_3_01014	I keep thinking—
ACR_3_01016	You're overthinking it, Dad.
ACR_3_01017	When it's about Mom, you\nalways do.
ACR_3_01019	How can I not?
ACR_3_01020	She's always on my mind.
ACR_3_01021	Especially since...
ACR_3_01022	Since I haven't been able to\nsay goodbye.
ACR_3_01263	Dad...
ACR_3_01026	Someone's calling...
ACR_3_01028	Hello, Gina. What is it?
ACR_3_01265	The system is acting up again.
ACR_3_01029	Oh?
ACR_3_01266	The security system is\nbehaving strangely.
ACR_3_01030	What in the...
ACR_3_01267	It's just one issue after another.\nHighly unusual.
ACR_3_01031	OK. I'll be right there.
ACR_3_01033	Did something happen?
ACR_3_01034	More trouble at the lab.
ACR_3_01042	I'm sorry to leave you alone\nagain, but I have to go.
ACR_3_01043	All right.
ACR_3_01268	Oh, right!
ACR_3_01045	There's a restaurant nearby\nif you get hungry.
ACR_3_01046	Feel free to order something.
ACR_3_01047	Just say you're my daughter, and\nthey'll put it on my tab.
ACR_3_01048	Will do.
ACR_3_01049	OK, I'd better go.
ACR_3_01050	You got this, Dad.
ACR_3_01051	Yeah! I guess I do, don't I?
ACR_3_01054	He's so busy... We never have\ntime to just talk.
ACR_3_01269	I forgot to tell him about the\nRAS opening the lock.
ACR_3_01271	Sorry for the wait, Matthew.
ACR_3_01272	Good timing. I can't log in to\nthe computer.
ACR_3_01273	It needs a password.
ACR_3_01274	Oh no.
ACR_3_01275	My dad just left for the lab.\nI can't ask him for it.
ACR_3_01276	Maybe he wrote it down\nsomewhere?
ACR_3_01277	Knowing him, that's very likely...\n
ACR_3_01278	Let's take a look around his room\nand see if we can find anything.
ACR_3_01279	On it!
ACR_3_01071	All right, we're in!
ACR_3_01072	Yes!
ACR_3_01281	Now we just gotta pop the\ndisk in, and we're good.
ACR_3_01282	Let me see it, Matthew.
ACR_3_01283	One sec...
ACR_3_01284	Here you go.
ACR_3_01073	And it goes...
ACR_3_01286	Uh... Oh no.
ACR_3_01075	This computer has no disk drive!
ACR_3_01287	So we can't see the data?
ACR_3_01288	Wait... Dad said he had an\nexternal floppy drive.
ACR_3_01076	So it must be somewhere\naround here.
ACR_3_01077	Let's look for it.
ACR_3_01289	OK, I can access the floppy disk.
ACR_3_01290	A file popped up on the screen...
ACR_3_01291	What is this?
ACR_3_01082	Open it.
ACR_3_01363	■■/1■\nM■chael Cru■■e\n\nMy company is n■t responsible for the\n■■■■ cause of the lake's water pollution.\n\nThrough the independent water-quality\ntesting I conducted ■■■■ a\n■■■■■■■■■, I discovered that\nan unknown contaminant has been\nflowing into the lake for ■■■■■■■\n■■■■■.\n\nI ■■■■ ascertain what this un■■■■\nsubstance is, and eliminate any suspicion\nregarding Crusoe Resort's\n■■■■■■■■■■■ as s■on as\n■■■■■■■■.
ACR_3_01292	The data looks corrupted, so I\ncan't read it all.
ACR_3_01092	Seems like your dad wrote\nit though.
ACR_3_01293	It says "eliminate any suspicion."
ACR_3_01294	Right. That must be it...
ACR_3_01094	It's why he was investigating\nthe lake's pollution!
ACR_3_01099	And he figured out that this\n"unknown contaminant" is what's\ncausing it.
ACR_3_01101	Do you think this is why your dad\ndisappeared?
ACR_3_01102	Because he was trying to find\nwhat really polluted the lake?
ACR_3_01103	It must be!
ACR_3_01104	Someone didn't want Dad to\nfind out, and they got to him!
ACR_3_01295	I'm close, Dad...
ACR_3_01296	Ashley, I want to check out\nthe lake.
ACR_3_01297	There's a water-quality testing\nkit in my dad's briefcase.
ACR_3_01298	We'll use that to find this\n"unknown contaminant," and\nthen I'll figure out where it's\ncoming from!
ACR_3_01302	This...looks pretty old...
ACR_3_01303	Too old to use, that's for sure...
ACR_3_01305	Hmm... How else can we test the\nlake's water quality?
ACR_3_01307	Ah!
ACR_3_01308	The computer just made a noise.
ACR_3_01309	Hm. There's something on\nthe screen.
ACR_3_01311	Authenticating DAS... Approach to connect.
ACR_3_01312	What's a DAS?
ACR_3_01313	It's this. My dad made it.
ACR_3_01314	Let's see what happens when I\nhold it near the computer...
ACR_3_01318	Installing...
ACR_3_01320	What is this?
ACR_3_01338	That's the phone... Maybe\nDad's calling.
ACR_3_01339	Watch the DAS, Matthew.
ACR_3_01340	Sure. Uh... Can I play with it once\nit's finished installing?
ACR_3_01341	It won't work for you. It only\nlikes me.
ACR_3_01342	Aw, c'mon.
ACR_3_01138	Hello?
ACR_3_01139	Ashley? Is that you?
ACR_3_01140	Jessica!
ACR_3_01141	How's the trip?
ACR_3_01142	All right, I guess.
ACR_3_01143	You should get out and enjoy\nyourself. Is your dad there?
ACR_3_01144	He's at the lab. Something\ncame up.
ACR_3_01145	I see. Did he say when he'd\nbe back?
ACR_3_01146	Nope. He didn't say much.\nAs usual.
ACR_3_01147	OK. I'll try again later.
ACR_3_01325	Oh!
ACR_3_01327	Ashley!
ACR_Mystery_3_1_00045	It's an article about someone\nnamed Gilbert Moss.
ACR_Mystery_3_1_00046	Says he's living in Lake Juliet.
ACR_Mystery_3_1_00047	Dated September 9th, 1998...\nNot a very recent report.
ACR_Mystery_3_1_00062	It's a landscape photo.\nIt's so pretty.
ACR_Mystery_3_1_00063	A small photo is hanging beside the\nnewspaper articles.
ACR_Mystery_3_1_00064	These articles aren't about\nanything worth mentioning.
ACR_Mystery_3_1_00065	A newspaper article has been stuck to the wall.
ACR_Mystery_3_1_00054	An old article about someone named Gilbert has\nbeen hung on the wall.
ACR_Mystery_3_1_00061	Matthew must be in this house.
ACR_Mystery_3_3_00001	The RAS is responding!\nWhich means...
ACR_Mystery_3_3_00051	I knew it. The DAS responded,\ntoo. So maybe I can open this.
ACR_Mystery_3_3_00052	Let's try one more time.
ACR_Mystery_3_3_00053	Ugh. This is tough.
ACR_Mystery_3_3_00023	I need to unlock the covered\nbridge right now.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00101	"Applied Techniques of\nPhotochemistry: Wavelengths\nof Light as Interpreted by\nCameras."
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00102	Oof, what a title... Must be what\nhe's reading right now.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00103	There's an academic book about light\nand wavelengths.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00107	That's Dad's glasses case.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00108	There's a glasses case.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00109	Just some packing tape. Must be\nwhat he used on the boxes\nin here.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00110	There's packing tape.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00111	Why is there a tube in here?
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00112	There is a tube in a drawer, for some reason.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00113	This cable must connect to some\ncomputer around here.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00120	The device looks like it might be useful.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00121	Maybe he wrote his password\nin this notebook.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00122	Nope... I guess I should be glad\nhe's not that careless.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00128	There's a novel.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00129	Ugh, Dad... Really shouldn't leave\nthings lying around like this.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00130	There are some bandages.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00131	I wonder if these batteries have\nany juice left in them.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00132	There are a couple batteries.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00078	Dad put some pictures up.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00087	Let's take a look.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00099	I'd better enter it before\nI forget.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00100	What order should these be in?
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00048	Wow. Dad made all this origami?
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00049	He must really love it.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00079	Maybe I'll ask him to teach me\nhow to fold these.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00080	There's something written on it...\nWhat is this supposed to mean?
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00081	Oh, it's a photo. Why would\nsomeone write this on the\nback though?
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00082	Maybe the other photos have\nwriting on them too.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00083	And knowing Dad...I bet one of\nthem has his password on it.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00084	I should check out the pictures\non the wall.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00085	I bet there's something here.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00071	Let's try entering the password.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00072	Maybe I should give it a little\nmore thought.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00073	Hm... Looks like the\nwrong password.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00075	I need to find the computer's\npassword.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00123	There are a couple pens and a notepad.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00124	Dad does get hurt a lot...
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00125	There are bandages.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00126	There are some novels here.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00127	I wonder if he reads before\ngoing to sleep.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00114	There's a cable for the computer.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00115	This origami paper hasn't been\nfolded yet.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00116	There's brand-new origami paper.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00117	Jeez, Dad, you should throw\nthese out once they're empty...
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00118	There's an empty plastic bottle.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00119	I wonder if this is used with\nthe computer.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00086	Let's check this out.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00088	I need to remember the\npassword.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00089	If these pictures are like the\nother, there should be something\nwritten on the back.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00090	But the order of the photos is\nall mixed up! Come on, Dad...
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00091	I might as well put them in order\nwhile looking for the password.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00092	This is the order the photos were\ntaken in, right?
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00093	Now, what does the writing on\nthe back say?
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00094	I sure do hope it's the password...
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00095	There. I think this is the\nright order.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00096	What about the backs? I should\nturn them over.
ACR_Mystery_3_4_00097	This has to be it.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00002	What's this?
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00048	Hmm, there's a slot. Looks like a\ndisk could fit in it.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00010	I wonder if this can connect to\nthe drive on the computer.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00018	Perfect, it fit.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00019	Now I can use this computer to\ncheck out the data.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00023	Looks wrong...
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00027	Now I can connect this to\nthe computer.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00030	I need to connect the cable to\nthe drive to read it.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00031	Dad mentioned that there's\na drive...
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00032	I wonder where it is.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00033	It's for the computer, so it's\nprobably in Dad's room.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00034	Nice! Now if I connect the\ncomputer and disk drive...
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00035	Hm. There's no cable to\nconnect them...
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00037	We need a cable to connect to\nthe disk drive to the computer.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00038	There we go.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00039	Now the disk...
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00058	I guess I'm not sure if this cable\nfits the drive...
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00057	I should check that first.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00056	I should see if this cable will fit\nin the drive.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00040	Just gotta pop it into the drive.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00041	Nope, that's not right...
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00042	All right, the drive's connected.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00043	Now we can check out the data.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00049	There we go!
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00044	I should connect the cable to the\ndrive before connecting this to\nthe computer.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00045	Let's plug the cable into the\ndrive first.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00050	Let's plug the cable into the\ndrive first.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00051	All that's left is to connect the\ndrive to the computer.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00052	Let's connect the drive to the\ncomputer.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00053	I'll take a closer look at the\nphotos later.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00054	Family photos are hanging up.
ACR_Mystery_3_5_00055	Let's look at the data on the\nfloppy disk.
ACR_4_Scenario_00119	Where's the mermaid\nstatue again?
ACR_4_Scenario_00004	I need to check the water quality\nnear the mermaid statue.
ACR_4_Scenario_00005	I need to check the water quality\nnear the mermaid statue.
ACR_4_Scenario_00006	Dad said I can put any meals on\nhis tab, but...
ACR_4_Scenario_00007	I need to check the water quality\nnear the mermaid statue first.
ACR_4_Scenario_00008	I'll come back later.
ACR_4_Scenario_00009	I'll be waiting at the restaurant.
ACR_4_Scenario_00030	I'll stay away from the clock\ntower for now. Matthew doesn't\nlike this place...
ACR_4_Scenario_00031	I should look near the mermaid\nstatue instead.
ACR_4_Scenario_00032	I should check out the lake near\nthe mermaid statue.
ACR_4_Scenario_00036	It looks like we could check\nthings out here, but...
ACR_4_Scenario_00037	I should check out the lake near\nthe mermaid statue.
ACR_4_Scenario_00040	This is the restaurant, but...
ACR_4_Scenario_00041	I need to follow Matthew\nright now.
ACR_4_Scenario_00042	I need to follow Matthew\nright now.
ACR_4_Scenario_00044	I need to follow Matthew\nright now.
ACR_4_Scenario_00045	He didn't come this way.
ACR_4_Scenario_00046	I've gotta chase after Matthew.
ACR_4_Scenario_00047	He didn't come this way.
ACR_4_Scenario_00048	I've gotta chase after Matthew.
ACR_4_Scenario_00049	I can't just open it\nwithout asking.
ACR_4_Scenario_00050	I shouldn't go in without\nasking first...
ACR_4_Scenario_00051	Go on, hurry home!
ACR_4_Scenario_00052	Ahem! That's my greenhouse, and\nI don't recall inviting you into it.
ACR_4_Scenario_00053	And just how long do you plan on\nhanging around? Go on!
ACR_4_Scenario_00054	Don't make me repeat myself.
ACR_4_Scenario_00055	You'd better be heading home.
ACR_4_Scenario_00056	Go on, hurry on home!
ACR_4_Scenario_00057	That's my storage shed you're\npoking around. Leave it be!
ACR_4_Scenario_00059	That's a guitar...
ACR_4_Scenario_00065	The kid's still eating. Why don't\nyou check out the photos?
ACR_4_Scenario_00067	They take practice seriously...\nI probably shouldn't interrupt.
ACR_4_Scenario_00068	This burger is as delicious as it\nlooks! It's perfect!
ACR_4_Scenario_00070	Did you check out the photos\non the wall?
ACR_4_Scenario_00071	And here I thought all Dad did\nwas sit in a dimly lit room\ndoing research.
ACR_4_Scenario_00072	But I guess he has friends, just\nlike a normal person.
ACR_4_Scenario_00134	Framed photos are hung side-by-side.
ACR_4_Scenario_00135	There are photos of Richard and his friends\nfishing and playing music.
ACR_4_Scenario_00136	And here I thought all Dad did\nwas sit in a dimly lit room\ndoing research.
ACR_4_Scenario_00137	But I guess he has friends, just\nlike a normal person.
ACR_4_Scenario_00138	I wonder if any of the other\nphotos are worth checking out.
ACR_4_Scenario_00073	There are old photos of Bob on the wall.
ACR_4_Scenario_00074	It must have been Mom who gave\nBob the idea for his burger.
ACR_4_Scenario_00075	But who was Mom meeting at\nthe clock tower?
ACR_4_Scenario_00076	An old acquaintance? Who could\nthat be?
ACR_4_Scenario_00077	Let's go back to Dad's cottage.
ACR_4_Scenario_00078	Better not go this way... I don't\nwant that lady to yell at me.
ACR_4_Scenario_00079	Let's go back to Dad's cottage\nfor now.
ACR_4_Scenario_00082	I need to talk to Ryan.
ACR_4_Scenario_00083	I'm glad the two of us got to talk.
ACR_4_Scenario_00092	Bob's Food Hut
ACR_4_Scenario_00093	Featuring Lake Juliet's specialty:\nThe Salmon Rice Burger!
ACR_4_Scenario_00094	Take a right at the roundabout up ahead.
ACR_4_Scenario_00118	Ohh, now that's a tasty-looking\nburger. I should get one.
ACR_4_01099	What's wrong?
ACR_4_01100	New Feature Installed: Water-Quality Analysis
ACR_4_01101	Check it out!
ACR_4_01102	Whoa, what's this?
ACR_4_01103	Water-quality analysis?
ACR_4_01104	I guess it picked up a\nnew feature.
ACR_4_01106	What the heck does that mean?
ACR_4_01107	Yeah, it's a little confusing.\nBut I think...
ACR_4_01108	we can check water quality just\nby scanning it with the DAS.
ACR_4_01109	So we can investigate the lake\npollution with this thing!
ACR_4_01110	My dad designed all sorts of\nfeatures for the DAS, huh?
ACR_4_01111	Why were you investigating\nthe pollution?
ACR_4_01112	Does it have something to do\nwith why Mom came here 13\nyears ago?
ACR_4_01115	Come on, Ashley...
ACR_4_01116	Let's use the DAS to investigate\nthe lake pollution.
ACR_4_01117	Right. I'll help however I can.
ACR_4_01118	Thank you.
ACR_4_01119	Which part of the lake should\nwe use for a water sample?
ACR_4_01120	It might be easiest near the\nmermaid statue.
ACR_4_01121	Got it. Let's take the DAS over\nthere and check out the water.
ACR_4_00096	Hmm... Maybe it'll stand out more\nif I put it here?
ACR_4_00099	That looks so good...
ACR_4_00100	Yeah it does!
ACR_4_00102	Hey there, you two.
ACR_4_00103	This burger right here is a\nLake Juliet specialty!
ACR_4_00104	You should get yourself one!\nRestaurant's over there.
ACR_4_00106	Is that the restaurant Dad was\ntelling me about?
ACR_4_00107	He said I could put my food on\nhis tab.
ACR_4_00108	A tab, eh?
ACR_4_00110	You wouldn't happen to be Dr.\nRobins's daughter, would you?
ACR_4_00111	That's me. I'm Ashley.
ACR_4_00113	Ashley, of course! He told me\nabout you.
ACR_4_00114	He said to take good care of you\nand your friend, if you come by.
ACR_4_00115	I'm Bob. I own the place. Nice to\nmeet you, miss!
ACR_4_00116	Nice to meet you, Bob.
ACR_4_00117	Come visit whenever you like,\nall right? I'll be around.
ACR_4_00118	Sure thing. Thanks!
ACR_4_01122	Matthew?
ACR_4_01123	Sorry, I...
ACR_4_01124	I can't go there. No matter what.
ACR_4_01127	No, I get it... I should apologize.
ACR_4_01130	This is the spot.
ACR_4_01131	Yeah, this is a good place.
ACR_4_01134	It must be the unknown\ncontaminant from your\ndad's file.
ACR_4_01135	If we can figure out what it is,\nI bet we can find the source.
ACR_4_01136	And then we'll be able to find\nmy dad!
ACR_4_01137	But how are we going to figure\nout what the contaminant is?
ACR_4_01138	Hmm...
ACR_4_01139	We could try searching my\ndad's computer.
ACR_4_01140	*grumble*
ACR_4_01141	Uhh...
ACR_4_01142	Hehe... Someone sounds hungry...
ACR_4_01143	Yeah, I'm kind of starving...
ACR_4_01144	Let's take a break at\nthe restaurant.
ACR_4_01145	And you can order whatever you\nwant, because my dad's paying!
ACR_4_01146	All right!
ACR_4_01147	Ah!
ACR_4_01148	Ashley, look!
ACR_4_01149	It's the sunglasses guy!
ACR_4_01150	Oh, come on, Matthew.
ACR_4_01151	Shh, look! He's on the phone\nwith someone!
ACR_4_01152	Hey, Ian. Yeah, it's me.
ACR_4_01153	More trouble with the system?
ACR_4_01154	Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Oh?
ACR_4_01155	So Dr. Robins is back in the\nlab, then?
ACR_4_01156	And have you found the\ndocument in question?
ACR_4_01157	Is that so... No, it must be\nthere somewhere.
ACR_4_01158	How many times do I have to\ntell you...
ACR_4_01159	Crusoe Resort is not responsible\nfor the pollution.
ACR_4_01160	Understood. I'll be in touch soon.
ACR_4_01161	I was sure the document was\nat J.C. Valley.
ACR_4_01162	My investigation just hit\na roadblock.
ACR_4_00176	I think he saw us.
ACR_4_00177	He's running! Let's chase him!
ACR_4_00179	What? Hey!
ACR_4_00181	Matthew, wait!
ACR_4_01163	Ashley.
ACR_4_00193	Eek!
ACR_4_00197	You were listening in on my\nphone call, weren't you?
ACR_4_00198	You knew?
ACR_4_00200	Of course. I'm a special agent,\nafter all.
ACR_4_00201	So how much did you hear?
ACR_4_00203	I heard everything.
ACR_4_00204	You were talking about\nCrusoe Resort.
ACR_4_00205	...
ACR_4_00207	Crusoe Resort was Matthew's\ndad's company.
ACR_4_00208	Hang on. Matthew's dad...
ACR_4_00209	You know something about him,\ndon't you?
ACR_4_00210	Hmph.
ACR_4_00211	Just tell me.
ACR_4_00212	You're looking into what went on\nhere five years ago.
ACR_4_00213	And Matthew's dad is somehow\ninvolved in that, right?
ACR_4_00214	Remember what I told you about\ncertain truths...
ACR_4_00215	Trust the adults to handle\nthe situation.
ACR_4_01164	Hmph.
ACR_4_00217	And that goes for Matthew too.\nGot it?
ACR_4_00219	Could he be any shadier?
ACR_4_00220	But now I'm super curious...
ACR_4_00221	It seems like he's investigating\nJ.C. Valley too.
ACR_4_00222	What's the connection between\nCrusoe Resort and J.C. Valley?
ACR_4_00223	Nobody knows where Matthew's\ndad is or what polluted the lake...
ACR_4_00224	There just has to be some kind\nof connection, but what?
ACR_4_00226	Wait, where'd Matthew go?
ACR_4_00234	Matthew!
ACR_4_00236	Ashley!
ACR_4_00237	Where'd he go? He should have\ncome this way, but...
ACR_4_00238	It's like he just disappeared.
ACR_4_00239	He gave me the slip too.
ACR_4_01165	Aw, man.
ACR_4_00242	Huh?
ACR_4_00244	I've seen that crest before...
ACR_4_00253	What do you think you're doing?!
ACR_4_00254	...
ACR_4_00255	...
ACR_4_00258	Hold it right there, you two!
ACR_4_00259	This is my garden!
ACR_4_00260	And you're trespassing.
ACR_4_00261	I'm so sorry!
ACR_4_00262	What are you doing here?
ACR_4_00268	We got lost.
ACR_4_00269	You got lost?
ACR_4_00270	Yeah.
ACR_4_00271	We were taking a walk and got\nturned around.
ACR_4_00272	Now you listen here.
ACR_4_00273	I am not a part of some Lake\nJuliet sightseeing loop.
ACR_4_00274	My garden is not some\ntourist attraction.
ACR_4_00275	I'm not teaching a class on how\nto grow the perfect rose.
ACR_4_00276	And I'm not selling any locally\nsourced homegrown organic\nwhatevers!
ACR_4_00279	We're looking for someone.
ACR_4_00280	And who might that be?
ACR_4_00281	A man in sunglasses. Did he\ncome through here?
ACR_4_00282	A man in sunglasses? That's your\nwhole description?
ACR_4_00283	Uh... Well, he's tall. And he's\nwearing a suit.
ACR_4_00284	And he's super sketchy!
ACR_4_00285	Nobody like that's been\nthrough here.
ACR_4_00288	Now get out of my garden.
ACR_4_00289	Quickly, now! Shoo, shoo!
ACR_4_00290	Uh, y-yeah. Right. Let's go.
ACR_4_01166	I recognize that boy...
ACR_4_00296	Ugh. Sunglasses guy got away.
ACR_4_00297	Not to mention some mean old\nlady yelled at us.
ACR_4_00298	I'm pooped.
ACR_4_00299	Same. And hungry. And thirsty...
ACR_4_00302	Let's head over to that\nrestaurant.
ACR_4_00303	OK, but then we gotta look at the\npollution on the computer.
ACR_4_00304	Right. Let's go.
ACR_4_01342	(Exert Noise)
ACR_4_00312	It's Tommy and Janet!
ACR_4_00315	So cool!
ACR_4_00316	Right?
ACR_4_01350	(Exert Noise)
ACR_4_01348	(Exert Noise)
ACR_4_00321	Whoa...
ACR_4_01343	(Exert Noise)
ACR_4_01351	(Exert Noise)
ACR_4_01349	(Exert Noise)
ACR_4_00325	Yo, Ashley!
ACR_4_00328	Hey! Do you guys usually\npractice here?
ACR_4_00329	Yeah! The owner's great.
ACR_4_00330	He said we can use the place\nwhenever there's downtime.
ACR_4_00331	Oh, cool!
ACR_4_00332	What were you playing? Did\nyou write it yourselves?
ACR_4_00333	Not bad, huh?
ACR_4_00334	It was great!
ACR_4_00335	Well, I was the one who wrote it.
ACR_4_00336	Hang on! I helped!
ACR_4_00337	Hehe.
ACR_4_00340	Ashley, I'm hungry...
ACR_4_00342	Who's this?
ACR_4_00343	He's... He's a friend of mine.
ACR_4_00346	Ashley?
ACR_4_00348	He works at the guesthouse.
ACR_4_00349	Uh...
ACR_4_00352	Bob, the guy who owns this place,\nis out shopping right now.
ACR_4_00353	He oughta be back soon.
ACR_4_00355	I don't think he recognized you.
ACR_4_00356	Phew...
ACR_4_00359	So, your song...
ACR_4_00360	Will it have vocals?
ACR_4_00361	Sure, of course.
ACR_4_00363	Our band's biggest selling points\nare Tommy's skill with a guitar...
ACR_4_00364	and my tight-as-a-drum\ndrummin'.
ACR_4_00365	But you know what really brings\nit all home?
ACR_4_00366	<color=#00994CFF>Elizabeth's vocals</color>! She's like our\nsecret weapon!
ACR_4_00368	But, despite us waiting for ages,\nour leader didn't show up today.
ACR_4_00369	Such a pain!
ACR_4_00371	What should we do, Tommy?\nWanna go look for her?
ACR_4_00372	She'll show her face sooner or later.
ACR_4_00373	But the <color=#00994CFF>band contest</color> is just\naround the corner.
ACR_4_00374	And we need time to re-record\nour demo!
ACR_4_00375	Chill about the contest, OK?
ACR_4_00376	I'm just doing this to have fun!\nSomething to look back on.
ACR_4_00377	What? But I'm totally serious! \nI want to hit it big!
ACR_4_00378	That why you didn't bring\nyour drums?
ACR_4_00379	I'm practicing at home.
ACR_4_00380	Lugging a whole drum set around\nisn't as easy as lifting a guitar.
ACR_4_00381	Besides, if we're going to meet\nup as a band, the whole band\nneeds to meet up. Even Elizabeth.
ACR_4_00382	Yeah, yeah. I know.
ACR_4_00389	I'd really like to hear\nElizabeth sing.
ACR_4_00390	I really wish you could.
ACR_4_00391	She hasn't been super\nsociable lately.
ACR_4_00392	Oh. That's a shame.
ACR_4_00394	Now that you mention it...\nSomething is up with her.
ACR_4_00395	Yeah.
ACR_4_00396	She doesn't usually miss practice.
ACR_4_00397	It all started after we recorded\nour demo.
ACR_4_00398	Right...
ACR_4_00400	I ran into her near the\nboathouse earlier...
ACR_4_00401	I wonder...
ACR_4_00402	Was she avoiding band practice?
ACR_4_00408	You're pretty serious about\nthe contest, huh?
ACR_4_00409	You play guitar, right? Did you\nconsider entering?
ACR_4_00410	Actually, I did enter... For now...
ACR_4_00411	Aha, I knew it!
ACR_4_00412	I had a feeling you'd be all\nover it!
ACR_4_00413	I could see it in your eyes while\nwe were performing.
ACR_4_00414	Yeah? What'd you see?
ACR_4_00416	OK, you caught me...
ACR_4_00417	I'm in a band back home.
ACR_4_00418	So when I heard you and\nTommy playing...
ACR_4_00420	What? You're in a band?
ACR_4_00421	Yeah. I play guitar.
ACR_4_00422	So cool!
ACR_4_00423	I guess.
ACR_4_00425	So what's your band like?
ACR_4_00426	There's just two of us. Keyboard\nand guitar.
ACR_4_00427	Is the keyboard player a\ngirl too?
ACR_4_00428	No, he's a guy. He sings too.
ACR_4_00429	Oh, wow!
ACR_4_00430	We only just recently grouped\nup together.
ACR_4_00431	He writes the music. I add\nthe lyrics.
ACR_4_00432	I'm still trying to decide if I want\nto go through with the contest.
ACR_4_00433	Hold on a sec... Is the keyboard\nplayer your boyfriend?
ACR_4_00434	Wh-what?
ACR_4_00436	N-no! He's not!
ACR_4_00437	Hmmm.
ACR_4_00439	How confident are you about\nthe contest?
ACR_4_00440	I, um, kind of just lost my\nconfidence. A little bit.
ACR_4_00441	I mean, Tommy's amazing.
ACR_4_00442	I can't come close to that.
ACR_4_00443	Playing good's not about\nanything but having fun.
ACR_4_00448	Tommy, come here...
ACR_4_00449	What?
ACR_4_00452	You're gonna be in a\nband contest?
ACR_4_00453	Yeah.
ACR_4_00454	If we win, we might get signed.
ACR_4_00455	So you want to be a musician.
ACR_4_00456	Yep.
ACR_4_00457	Like, seriously?
ACR_4_00458	I mean, yeah, pretty serious.\nI think.
ACR_4_00483	Hey, Ashley, come here.
ACR_4_00484	Huh?
ACR_4_00486	What's up?
ACR_4_00487	Now that I know you entered\nthe contest...
ACR_4_00488	I've gotta hear what you can do!
ACR_4_00489	I, uh...
ACR_4_00490	Right, Tommy?
ACR_4_00491	Just one song.
ACR_4_00492	You in, Ashley?
ACR_4_00499	It's kinda hard to say yes after\nhearing how good Tommy is.
ACR_4_00500	But seeing that guitar, I really\nwant to get my hands on it...
ACR_4_00501	OK... Just be yourself...\nI can do this!
ACR_4_00503	All right, let's jam!
ACR_4_00504	Now you're talking!
ACR_4_00505	Lend me a guitar?
ACR_4_00506	I've got another one here.
ACR_4_00508	Oh, your guitar is electric?
ACR_4_00509	I play an acoustic. It's\ngot a pickup though.
ACR_4_00510	An acoustic-electric, huh?
ACR_4_00511	Any effects?
ACR_4_00512	Nope.
ACR_4_00513	In that case, it's gonna sound\nway different than yours.
ACR_4_00514	Whatcha think? That gonna\nbe OK?
ACR_4_00515	I'll give it a shot!
ACR_4_00516	Won't know unless I try, right?
ACR_4_00517	Very punk rock of you.
ACR_4_00518	All right, let's do this.
ACR_4_00522	It's hard after hearing how\ngood Tommy plays.
ACR_4_00523	I really don't want to\nembarrass myself...
ACR_4_00524	Yeah... Gonna pass this time.
ACR_4_00526	I think I'm gonna pass.
ACR_4_00527	Aww man! I wanted to hear\nyou play!
ACR_4_00528	What?
ACR_4_00529	Use my other guitar.\nIt's over there.
ACR_4_00530	That's an electric, isn't it?\nI use an acoustic-electric...
ACR_4_00531	Yeah... Not this time.
ACR_4_00532	Besides, if I'm not playing my\nguitar, then it's not really me.
ACR_4_00533	Do you play music with your guitar?
ACR_4_00534	Because this guitar plays music.
ACR_4_00536	Exactly! Music's what\nwe want to hear.
ACR_4_00537	Not your technique, but\nyour style!
ACR_4_00538	Let us hear you!
ACR_4_00540	OK. I'll try.
ACR_4_00541	Heck yeah!
ACR_4_00542	The pedal's over there.
ACR_4_00543	Wow... Aren't those, like,\nsuper expensive?
ACR_4_00544	Umm, maybe?
ACR_4_00545	He bought it used. Saved money\nfrom his part-time gig.
ACR_4_00546	Don't tell her that!
ACR_4_00547	Hahaha.
ACR_4_00548	All right, let's do this.
ACR_4_00553	Phew!
ACR_4_00555	Wow, you really worked up a\nsweat, huh?
ACR_4_00556	Well, I was kinda nervous. Like,\nall the way nervous.
ACR_4_00557	You were going too fast, Tommy!
ACR_4_00559	Wow, you're not bad.
ACR_4_00561	You're amazing, Tommy!
ACR_4_00562	You're gonna win that contest\nfor sure!
ACR_4_00563	Thanks, but...
ACR_4_00564	Hmm...
ACR_4_00566	What's wrong?
ACR_4_00567	We lost the demo we recorded\nfor the contest.
ACR_4_00568	It was on Elizabeth's\nmusic player.
ACR_4_00569	But she lost it somewhere.
ACR_4_00571	We could just re-record it, but...
ACR_4_00573	That was our best\nperformance ever!
ACR_4_00574	Don't say we can re-record it.\nAin't that easy.
ACR_4_00575	I know, I know...
ACR_4_00576	You don't think lightning can\nstrike twice, and Elizabeth\ndoesn't come to practice.
ACR_4_00577	But we could really be\nsomething special.
ACR_4_00579	That's why we're here practicing.\nIt's how we get better!
ACR_4_00580	C'mon. Let's get back to it.
ACR_4_00581	Got it.
ACR_4_00583	So that's how it is.
ACR_4_00591	I'm back!
ACR_4_00593	We missed you, Bob!
ACR_4_00594	What would the diner do\nwithout you?
ACR_4_00595	Are the future rock stars\npracticing hard?
ACR_4_00598	Hey, Ashley! Glad you came!
ACR_4_00599	I heard you have the best food\nin town.
ACR_4_00600	When are we gonna eat?
ACR_4_00601	Didn't mean to keep you waiting.
ACR_4_00602	Sorry 'bout that, kiddo. I'll whip\nsomething up on the double.
ACR_4_00603	Thanks!
ACR_4_00604	You got it!
ACR_4_00606	You seem like a really nice guy.
ACR_4_00607	Nice? Who, me?
ACR_4_00608	Yeah, you!
ACR_4_00609	You even let Tommy and his\nfriends practice here.
ACR_4_00610	I don't think most restaurant\nowners would do that.
ACR_4_00611	Oh, well, that's no big deal.
ACR_4_00612	Look at their faces. Who could\nsay no to that?
ACR_4_00613	Reminds me of my younger days.
ACR_4_00614	I was a bit of a troublemaker, but\nI had my passions.
ACR_4_00616	Thanks for everything, Bob.
ACR_4_00617	You know what says gratitude?\nSpending some money!
ACR_4_00618	Perfected the art of sipping a\nsingle soda so slowly...
ACR_4_00620	But that's kids. What can you do?
ACR_4_00621	Hehe.
ACR_4_00635	Ah, new faces!
ACR_4_00636	Welcome to Bob's Food Hut.
ACR_4_00637	Hi. I heard about your restaurant\nfrom my dad.
ACR_4_00638	He said that I should order and\nput it on his tab.
ACR_4_00639	Tab, you say?
ACR_4_00640	Does that mean you're\nDr. Robins's daughter?
ACR_4_00641	Yep. I'm Ashley.
ACR_4_00642	Ashley! I've heard so much\nabout you.
ACR_4_00643	He said to take care of you and\nyour friend if you came by.
ACR_4_00644	I'm Bob, owner of this fine\nestablishment.
ACR_4_00645	Nice to meet you.
ACR_4_00646	When are we gonna eat?
ACR_4_00672	What would you like to\neat, kiddo?
ACR_4_00673	Anything good!
ACR_4_01167	Oh, well in that case, I've got just\nthe thing for you!
ACR_4_00677	Salmon Rice Burger?
ACR_4_00678	It's the most popular item on\nthe menu.
ACR_4_00679	I've never eaten a rice\nburger before...
ACR_4_00680	It's a tasty salmon filet nestled\nbetween buns of rice.
ACR_4_00681	We top it with our special sauce.
ACR_4_00682	Your taste buds won't know\nwhat hit 'em!
ACR_4_00683	Well, you do make it sound good...\nI'll take two!
ACR_4_01168	Can you even eat that much?
ACR_4_01169	I could eat eight! I'm starving!
ACR_4_01170	You'll pack away two, no problem.\nAnd what'll you have, miss?
ACR_4_01171	I'll have just one of them.
ACR_4_00687	Coming right up! They'll be ready\nin a jiffy, so just hang on.
ACR_4_00692	Does my dad come here a lot?
ACR_4_00693	Sure does. Doc Robins is one of\nmy regulars.
ACR_4_00694	Comes with his buddy, the\ndirector of J.C. Valley.
ACR_4_00695	Oh, wow. He's friends with\nElizabeth's dad?
ACR_4_00696	They sure seem to get along.
ACR_4_00697	Take a look at that table near\nthe entrance.
ACR_4_00699	The one next to the wall with\nthe photos?
ACR_4_00700	Yep. That's their usual spot. They\nalways look at those photos.
ACR_4_00701	Chatting, laughing, having a\ngreat time!
ACR_4_00702	Wow.
ACR_4_00703	Dr. Robins himself is in one of\nthe pictures. Have a look.
ACR_4_00705	All right. It's ready!
ACR_4_00707	I now present to you the salmon\nrice burger!
ACR_4_00708	It smells great!
ACR_4_01172	It looks so good...
ACR_4_01173	Let's dig in!
ACR_4_01174	It was just as good as it looked.\nThank you so much.
ACR_4_01175	Yeah, it was super tasty.
ACR_4_01176	Geez, Matthew, you really must\nhave been starving.
ACR_4_01177	Now could I interest you in\nsome dessert?
ACR_4_00711	No way, I'm stuffed. I'm gonna\ncheck out the photos.
ACR_4_00716	Framed photos are hung side-by-side.
ACR_4_00717	This may be the first time I've\nseen Dad having fun.
ACR_4_00723	The three of us first hit it off\nwhen we started <color=#00994CFF>talkin' music</color>.
ACR_4_00724	Nowadays we're <color=#00994CFF>fishing buddies</color>.
ACR_4_00731	You all talked about music?
ACR_4_00732	Does my dad even like music?
ACR_4_00733	Does he ever. In fact, when he\nwas younger, he dreamed of\nhitting it big!
ACR_4_00734	He's no slouch on piano, ya know.
ACR_4_00735	I didn't know, actually.
ACR_4_00736	I can't believe he can\nplay piano...
ACR_4_00737	He told me he played keyboard in\na rock band back in the day.
ACR_4_00738	Rex and I were crazy about the\nguitar. Same as Tommy.
ACR_4_00739	We all got pretty jazzed up goin'\non about those days, so...
ACR_4_00740	The three of us tried\njamming together.
ACR_4_00741	No! Seriously?
ACR_4_00742	Why would Dad hide that\nfrom me?
ACR_4_00752	Do you go fishing with my dad\na lot?
ACR_4_00753	Oh yeah. The three of us go out\nall the time.
ACR_4_00754	I taught them everything\nthey know.
ACR_4_00755	Of course, your dad and Rex are\nstill beginners.
ACR_4_00756	But they seem to be enjoying\nthemselves all the same.
ACR_4_00757	I had no idea.
ACR_4_00768	There's an old photo.
ACR_4_00769	Oh, wow, it's Bob!
ACR_4_00770	He's so young.
ACR_4_00772	I feel like I've seen that food\nstand somewhere before...
ACR_4_00773	*gasp*
ACR_4_00777	Thank you.
ACR_4_00778	Huh? Japanese food that uses\nsalmon? Well...
ACR_4_00779	Rice balls with salmon are\nprobably my favorite.
ACR_4_00781	I just remembered...
ACR_4_00782	Mom got food from this stand.
ACR_4_00787	That's me from a long time ago.
ACR_4_00788	I was a bit more handsome\nthen, eh?
ACR_4_00789	When was this taken?
ACR_4_00790	This was before I had the food\nhut, so about thirteen years ago.
ACR_4_00791	Thirteen years ago...
ACR_4_00792	This fine diner started out as a\nhumble food stand.
ACR_4_00793	I wanted a convenient way to\nsell my burgers.
ACR_4_00794	I'd set up shop wherever there\nwere tourists.
ACR_4_00795	Sold hamburgers every day.
ACR_4_00796	What changed?
ACR_4_00797	Well, it's not exactly that the\nburgers weren't popular...
ACR_4_00798	but they lacked that special\nsomething. Never sold out.
ACR_4_00799	I started thinkin' and realized\nwhat was missing.
ACR_4_00800	I needed a centerpiece. A real\nshowstopper.
ACR_4_00801	Oh! I know!
ACR_4_00802	You're talking about the Salmon\nRice Burger, aren't you?
ACR_4_00803	Bingo!
ACR_4_00804	Of course, I didn't come up with\nit all by my lonesome.
ACR_4_00805	It's quite the funny story, in fact.
ACR_4_00806	<color=#00994CFF>One of my customers</color> inspired it.
ACR_4_00807	They <color=#00994CFF>gave me a tip</color> that led to my\ngreatest invention.
ACR_4_00814	Who was the customer?
ACR_4_00815	She was a tourist who came to\nvisit the mermaid statue.
ACR_4_00816	Now that I think about it, her\neyes were just like yours.
ACR_4_00817	Had a young girl with her.
ACR_4_00818	She said she was meeting an old\nfriend by the clock tower.
ACR_4_00821	A customer gave you a tip?
ACR_4_00822	Yep. A fine tip indeed.
ACR_4_00823	I'd been pondering how to use\nthe salmon I caught in the lake.
ACR_4_00824	I wanted to make some sort of\nspecialty.
ACR_4_00825	But back then, all I could make\nwas hamburgers.
ACR_4_00826	I tried a few different salmon\nburgers...
ACR_4_00827	but I couldn't quite nail the level\nof quality I was lookin' for.
ACR_4_00828	As I'm racking my brain over it,\na woman came up to the stand.
ACR_4_00829	She mentioned she was Japanese.\nI thought, she might have a good\nidea for a recipe.
ACR_4_00830	She was Japanese?
ACR_4_00834	And I'll never forget what\nshe said...
ACR_4_00835	"Rice balls with salmon are\nprobably my favorite."
ACR_4_00836	She said you take the rice and\nball it up around the fish.
ACR_4_00837	That was my eureka moment!
ACR_4_00838	Maybe salmon goes better with\nrice than with bread!
ACR_4_00839	So how about I try using rice\nfor the bun?
ACR_4_00840	After that, I needed to puzzle out\nthe best way to cook the fish.
ACR_4_00841	So after a little trial and error...
ACR_4_00842	the Salmon Rice Burger\nwas born!
ACR_4_00844	That's quite the story.
ACR_4_00845	It must have been Mom who gave\nBob the tip.
ACR_4_00846	But who was Mom meeting at the\nclock tower?
ACR_4_00847	An old friend? Who could\nthat be?
ACR_4_00850	Aah. That was so good!
ACR_4_00851	How was it, kiddo? Meet\nyour standards?
ACR_4_00852	Yeah! I've never had a burger\nlike that.
ACR_4_00853	I would like fish a lot more if it\nall tasted like that!
ACR_4_00854	Very good.
ACR_4_00858	Ready to go, Matthew?
ACR_4_00859	Yep! I feel a lot better.
ACR_4_00861	Come back soon, Ashley. Got it?
ACR_4_00862	I will.
ACR_4_00863	Hey, Tommy. Janet. I'm\nheading out.
ACR_4_00864	See you later, Ashley.
ACR_4_00865	See ya.
ACR_4_00866	Good luck with practice.
ACR_4_00867	Thanks!
ACR_4_00871	Let's hurry back to your\ndad's cottage.
ACR_4_00874	Right. We'll use his computer to\nlook into the pollution.
ACR_4_01178	Ashley.
ACR_4_01352	(Exert Noise)
ACR_4_01179	Huh?
ACR_4_01180	Ashley, come on.
ACR_4_01181	Ryan?
ACR_4_01182	Go on ahead, Matthew.\nI'll catch up.
ACR_4_01183	OK.
ACR_4_01184	Sorry to surprise you.
ACR_4_01185	I wanted to speak, just the\ntwo of us.
ACR_4_01186	This is my cottage.
ACR_4_01187	Let's talk inside.
ACR_4_00911	Wow. It's so...minimalist.
ACR_4_00912	I have no need for possessions.\nI don't spend much time here.
ACR_4_00913	Too busy at work, huh? Sounds\nfamiliar.
ACR_4_00914	Something like that.
ACR_4_00915	But perhaps not as busy as you.
ACR_4_00916	What do you mean?
ACR_4_00917	Are you not?
ACR_4_00918	You've been wandering all over\nLake Juliet, haven't you?
ACR_4_00919	I guess you've seen me around.
ACR_4_00920	I have.
ACR_4_00921	I'm looking for my friend's dad.
ACR_4_00922	Is that so?
ACR_4_00923	He disappeared five years ago.
ACR_4_00924	So I'm trying to help my friend\nfigure out where he went.
ACR_4_00925	We've found a lot of information\nbut nothing really helpful yet.
ACR_4_00926	I see.
ACR_4_00927	I guess it sounds weird when I\nsay it like that, huh?
ACR_4_00928	No. It's understandable.
ACR_4_00929	Would you tell me your\nfriend's name?
ACR_4_00930	Matthew Crusoe.
ACR_4_00931	Crusoe...
ACR_4_00932	Is this friend of yours related to\nCrusoe Resort?
ACR_4_00933	You know about it?
ACR_4_00934	I do.
ACR_4_00935	It's not a secret. I believe\n<color=#00994CFF>everyone in town</color> is familiar.
ACR_4_00978	You said everyone knows about\nCrusoe Resort.
ACR_4_00979	Well, if they do, nobody seems to\nwant to talk about it.
ACR_4_00980	Is that so?
ACR_4_00981	Dan, the forest ranger, said that\nsomething bad happened.
ACR_4_00982	He wouldn't give me any details,\nthough.
ACR_4_00983	There is likely a reason why they\ncan't talk about it.
ACR_4_00984	Sometimes we know the truth\nbut wish to hide it.
ACR_4_01188	Do you know something?
ACR_4_01189	If you do, you have to tell me.
ACR_4_01190	You and I are a lot alike.
ACR_4_01191	What?
ACR_4_01192	I've believed that since meeting\nyou at the campsite.
ACR_4_01193	We have many things in common.
ACR_4_01194	We both lost a mother.
ACR_4_01195	We both treasured Sayoko.
ACR_4_01196	And we both have a strong\ndesire to learn the truth.
ACR_4_01197	Stop changing the subject.
ACR_4_01198	Tell me what you know about\nCrusoe Resort.
ACR_4_01199	There's nothing for me to tell.
ACR_4_01200	Nothing you don't already know.
ACR_4_01201	The accusations that the resort\npolluted the lake are false.
ACR_4_01202	Really?
ACR_4_01203	The resort's not responsible?
ACR_4_01204	That's correct.
ACR_4_01205	Then who's to blame?
ACR_4_01206	Who framed Crusoe Resort for\nthe pollution?
ACR_4_01207	Now that...
ACR_4_01208	you will learn in time.
ACR_4_01209	What's going on?
ACR_4_01210	I'm getting...a little headachey...
ACR_4_01211	My head feels fuzzy.
ACR_4_01212	You must be exhausted.
ACR_4_01213	Don't push yourself too hard.
ACR_4_01214	Curiosity is not a sin, Ashley.
ACR_4_01215	But don't forget...
ACR_4_01216	the real reason you came to\nLake Juliet.
ACR_4_01217	There's someone waiting here\nfor you.
ACR_4_01218	Ryan...
ACR_4_01219	I gotta get to my dad's. Matthew\nmust be worried about me.
ACR_4_01220	I understand.
ACR_4_01221	What's that?
ACR_4_01222	Oh, this?
ACR_4_01223	It's beautiful.
ACR_4_01224	It's a kaleidoscope. A memento\nof my mother.
ACR_4_01225	It's broken, but you can still see\na cherry-blossom in it.
ACR_4_01226	Looking through this always\nmade Sayoko miss Japan.
ACR_4_01227	My mom used this?
ACR_4_01228	Ah...
ACR_4_01229	What's wrong?
ACR_4_01230	I remember my mom holding this...
ACR_4_01231	Did you meet up with my mom\n13 years ago?
ACR_4_01232	No.
ACR_4_01233	But I remember it...
ACR_4_01234	Is it possible that this memory\nfrom 13 years ago...
ACR_4_01235	is from a different place?
ACR_4_01236	What?
ACR_4_01237	Your hippocampus myelinates\nso rapidly.
ACR_4_01238	And yet, despite your superb\nneural pathways, you are still\nsusceptible to false recall.
ACR_4_01239	Hm...
ACR_4_01240	I have memories that I recall\nincorrectly too.
ACR_4_01241	I fell gravely ill when I was\nyoung. My father treated me.
ACR_4_01242	That was when I first met his\nassistant, Sayoko.
ACR_4_01243	Really?
ACR_4_01244	The treatments were painful, but\nSayoko kept my spirits high.
ACR_4_01245	I'd give her this kaleidoscope\nbefore each session.
ACR_4_01246	And afterward, I'd wake up,\nand there she was.
ACR_4_01247	She'd hand me the kaleidoscope,\nsmile, and say...
ACR_4_01248	You were so brave, Ryan. Your\nmom was watching over you.\nI'm sure.
ACR_4_01249	But one day, I awoke to find\nmyself alone.
ACR_4_01250	Sayoko should have been by\nmy side...
ACR_4_01251	Surely that's a false recall.
ACR_4_01252	I had no idea...
ACR_4_01253	I'm glad we had a chance to talk.
ACR_4_01254	Yeah, me too. See you later.
ACR_4_01040	Huh?
ACR_4_01042	We're seriously going?
ACR_4_01043	No complaining.
ACR_4_01050	Hey, Ashley!
ACR_4_01051	I thought you were going to your\ndad's. How'd you end up here?
ACR_4_01052	Oh, um, just taking the\nscenic route.
ACR_4_01053	So you're free?
ACR_4_01054	Then you should come with us!
ACR_4_01056	Wait, what? Where?
ACR_4_01057	Elizabeth's place!
ACR_4_01058	Why me?
ACR_4_01059	Strength in numbers!
ACR_4_01060	What?
ACR_4_01061	We're going to get to the bottom\nof this Elizabeth situation.
ACR_4_01062	Like, ask her why she doesn't\ncome to practice.
ACR_4_01063	Aren't you curious?
ACR_4_01064	A little, but...
ACR_4_01065	Then it's settled!
ACR_4_01066	Yeah, come with us!
ACR_4_01067	Looks like I don't have a choice.
ACR_4_01068	OK, OK. Let's go.
ACR_4_01069	But I have a friend waiting, so I\ncan't stay long.
ACR_4_01070	No problem.
ACR_4_01071	Off we go!
ACR_4_01257	I don't know... I have a friend\nwaiting for me.
ACR_4_01258	Is that the kid you were with\nat Bob's?
ACR_4_01259	Yeah.
ACR_4_01260	Where's he at now?
ACR_4_01261	Waiting at my dad's cottage.
ACR_4_01262	Oh, he'll be fine. It's not like he's\na little kid.
ACR_4_01263	Well, sure, but...
ACR_4_01264	Our band's future is at stake!
ACR_4_01265	Please come with us.
ACR_4_01266	OK. Fine.
ACR_4_01267	But I can't keep my friend\nwaiting much longer.
ACR_4_01268	I knew you'd understand!
ACR_4_01269	Now let's go, go, go!
ACR_4_01270	Hmm...
ACR_4_01271	Ugh, it's useless! I don't get a word of this!
ACR_4_01347	(Exert Noise)
ACR_4_01272	If we don't find anything today...
ACR_4_01273	You have to go back to your uncle's for now.
ACR_4_01274	Urgh... We're running out of time.
ACR_4_01344	(Exert Noise)
ACR_4_01345	(Exert Noise)
ACR_4_01346	(Exert Noise)
ACR_Mystery_4_2_00004	I've gotta check out the\nlake's water.
ACR_Mystery_4_2_00012	I should be able to test the water\nquality using the new feature on\nthe DAS.
ACR_Mystery_4_2_00002	Somewhere around here should\nbe good.
ACR_Mystery_4_2_00003	Let's start up the DAS and give\nit a scan.
ACR_Mystery_4_2_00017	Displaying molecular model for unknown\ncontaminant scanned in liquid...
ACR_Mystery_4_2_00016	Checking against previously registered\nmolecular model...
ACR_Mystery_4_2_00005	Let's compare these two\nsubstances to see if\nthey're the same.
ACR_Mystery_4_2_00006	And if they are...
ACR_Mystery_4_2_00007	Then it means the lake is polluted\nwith whatever it is.
ACR_Mystery_4_2_00008	Hmm... Couldn't analyze it.
ACR_Mystery_4_2_00009	Looks like they need to overlap\nas much as possible. Otherwise it\ncan't test them.
ACR_Mystery_4_2_00010	Maybe changing the angle will\nget them to overlap.
ACR_5_Scenario_00001	So awkward, but... It probably\nwouldn't be cool to just bail...
ACR_5_Scenario_00002	Tell me what happened. I'm here\nfor you.
ACR_5_Scenario_00003	...
ACR_5_Scenario_00004	We should leave this to Tommy.
ACR_5_Scenario_00155	Ashley, over here.
ACR_5_Scenario_00005	It doesn't feel right going in\nright now.
ACR_5_Scenario_00185	I'm sorry you had to see\nthat, Ashley.
ACR_5_Scenario_00186	I'm going to head out. But you\nshould make yourselves at home.
ACR_5_Scenario_00187	Elizabeth can be difficult at\ntimes, but I hope you two can\nfind a way to get along.
ACR_5_Scenario_00007	I need to hurry and get the music\nplayer to Tommy and Janet.
ACR_5_Scenario_00009	Matthew's been on his own\nfor a while now...
ACR_5_Scenario_00010	I need to hand over the music\nplayer then get back to him.
ACR_5_Scenario_00013	Keep your eyes peeled for news\nabout the Salmon Rice Burger!
ACR_5_Scenario_00024	You should head home. That kid's\nwaiting for you, right?
ACR_5_Scenario_00025	Yeah, he is.
ACR_5_Scenario_00026	Don't worry about Elizabeth.
ACR_5_Scenario_00027	We'll take care of it.
ACR_5_Scenario_00028	Thanks.
ACR_5_Scenario_00039	Matthew's waiting at Dad's\ncottage. I've gotta get back.
ACR_5_Scenario_00040	Matthew's waiting at Dad's\ncottage. I've gotta get back.
ACR_5_Scenario_00041	Matthew's waiting at Dad's\ncottage. I've gotta get back.
ACR_5_Scenario_00047	Matthew?
ACR_5_Scenario_00048	Maybe he's upstairs.
ACR_5_Scenario_00049	Where is he?
ACR_5_Scenario_00184	I've gotta find Matthew quick,\nbut I'm not sure where to look...
ACR_5_Scenario_00183	Hmm... That lady was in the\nphoto too...
ACR_5_Scenario_00189	Elizabeth isn't here yet, but\nI'm sure she'll show up. She\nloves to sing.
ACR_5_Scenario_00069	I should check at the old lady's\nhouse.
ACR_5_Scenario_00072	This isn't the way to the old\nlady's house.
ACR_5_Scenario_00080	We got yelled at pretty good the\nlast time we were here...
ACR_5_Scenario_00081	But Matthew has to be here.\nI gotta put on a brave face!
ACR_5_Scenario_00156	Oh, Ashley!
ACR_5_Scenario_00157	Bob?
ACR_5_Scenario_00158	No way am I going in there.\nI've been yelled at once already.
ACR_5_Scenario_00159	No way am I going in there.\nI've been yelled at once already.
ACR_5_Scenario_00160	Huh...
ACR_5_Scenario_00083	Robin used to store things in the\ntoolshed, but...
ACR_5_Scenario_00084	I'm really not sure where Olivia's\nkey might be.
ACR_5_Scenario_00161	I should check out the toolshed.
ACR_5_Scenario_00162	I should check out the toolshed.
ACR_5_Scenario_00101	Pretty dusty in here...
ACR_5_Scenario_00102	Hopefully we can find the key\nunder all this dust.
ACR_5_Scenario_00114	I've gotta tell Charlotte we found\nthe key.
ACR_5_Scenario_00163	I've gotta tell Charlotte we found\nthe key.
ACR_5_Scenario_00164	Let's check out the greenhouse.
ACR_5_Scenario_00182	There's a box that once contained a letter.
ACR_5_Scenario_00165	I should give the letter\nto Charlotte.
ACR_5_Scenario_00115	Don't let that kid out of your\nsight. Stay with him, got it?
ACR_5_Scenario_00116	I will, promise.
ACR_5_Scenario_00188	This isn't the way to the\nclock tower.
ACR_5_Scenario_00166	OK, I'll use the moon key.
ACR_5_Scenario_00181	Happy Birthday, Elizabeth.\nThanks for being a part of my life.\nYou're my angel.\nI hope your special day is full of love\nand laughter.\nI love you more than anyone in the world.\n - With love, your mother Kate
ACR_5_00006	What's she doing here?
ACR_5_00007	What's the problem? I asked her\nto come.
ACR_5_00008	So did I.
ACR_5_00009	Ugh. Why?
ACR_5_00011	Strength in numbers, right?
ACR_5_00012	Strength?
ACR_5_00013	Someone has been missing\npractice lately.
ACR_5_00014	Tommy and I want to know what's\ngoing on.
ACR_5_00015	We thought we might need\nsome backup.
ACR_5_00016	Excuse me?
ACR_5_00017	Ashley knows all about\nmusic practice.
ACR_5_00018	Which we thought might help!
ACR_5_00020	Right?
ACR_5_00022	Uh, sure.
ACR_5_00024	Oh, you're all friends now? Give\nme a break.
ACR_5_00026	Elizabeth, we're serious. What's\ngoing on?
ACR_5_00027	Why'd you stop coming?
ACR_5_00028	...
ACR_5_00030	Is there something wrong with\nyour voice?
ACR_5_00032	Do you not like the song?
ACR_5_00034	So it's that you're jealous of\nmy style.
ACR_5_00035	Worried I'm gonna show you up?
ACR_5_00036	As if!
ACR_5_00038	Then what is it?
ACR_5_00039	I know you're used to getting\nyour way, but come on.
ACR_5_00040	Do you even care about the\ncontest?
ACR_5_00041	We're almost out of time!
ACR_5_00042	I know, but...
ACR_5_00045	We're just worried about\nyou, OK?
ACR_5_00047	Stay out of this!
ACR_5_00048	Look, I know this is none of\nmy business.
ACR_5_00049	But just look at Tommy\nand Janet.
ACR_5_00050	Don't you see how much they\ncare about you?
ACR_5_00051	Condescending much?!
ACR_5_00052	I'm just trying to help!
ACR_5_00056	Elizabeth, what's the racket?\nKeep it down.
ACR_5_00057	Dad.
ACR_5_00059	Oh, I didn't know we had guests.
ACR_5_00061	Hey, Rex!
ACR_5_00062	Hi there, Janet.
ACR_5_00063	Hey.
ACR_5_00064	Hi, Tommy.
ACR_5_00065	And you're Richard's daughter.
ACR_5_00066	Yeah. Ashley.
ACR_5_00068	Let's not make guests wait\nin the entryway, Elizabeth.
ACR_5_00069	Please, make yourselves\ncomfortable.
ACR_5_00094	Can I get you anything? We have\nsome cake.
ACR_5_00095	Really? Yeah!
ACR_5_00097	Dad. Seriously. Get out.
ACR_5_00099	Young lady, that's no way to act\nin front of guests.
ACR_5_00100	You may not want me hanging\naround right now, but...
ACR_5_00101	But you need me to put on an\nact and play nice.
ACR_5_00102	Elizabeth, listen...
ACR_5_00103	I don't care. Just go away!
ACR_5_00104	Elizabeth!
ACR_5_00107	Whoa, hold on a minute.
ACR_5_00108	Can you save the family stuff\nfor later?
ACR_5_00109	We need to talk to Elizabeth.
ACR_5_00111	Of course, Janet.
ACR_5_00113	I'm going out. We'll talk when\nI get home.
ACR_5_00115	Make yourselves at home.
ACR_5_00118	Hey, Ashley!
ACR_5_00120	Huh? Yeah?
ACR_5_00121	Let me show you\nElizabeth's room.
ACR_5_00122	Um, sure. But what about\nthose two?
ACR_5_00124	They're fine. Let's give them\nsome space.
ACR_5_00126	Huh?
ACR_5_00127	Don't worry about it. Come on!
ACR_5_00129	Ashley and I are gonna wait in\nyour room, OK?
ACR_5_00130	Don't touch my stuff!
ACR_5_00131	Got it!
ACR_5_00132	It's upstairs. Let's go.
ACR_5_00133	OK.
ACR_5_00137	Elizabeth, we're really worried\nabout you.
ACR_5_00138	I know.
ACR_5_00139	Then be real with me. What\nhappened?
ACR_5_00140	Why'd you stop coming to\npractice?
ACR_5_00141	...
ACR_5_00145	You're sure we should just\nleave them?
ACR_5_00146	Definitely.
ACR_5_00147	She'll listen to Tommy.
ACR_5_00148	If the boy you like can't get\nthrough to you, who can?
ACR_5_00150	Oh! You mean...
ACR_5_00151	Don't tell me you didn't notice!
ACR_5_00152	Um...
ACR_5_00153	Well, well! We've finally found\nsomeone as oblivious as Tommy.
ACR_5_00154	Tommy doesn't know?
ACR_5_00155	If he does, he hasn't let on.
ACR_5_00156	Is he the reason she stopped\ngoing to practice?
ACR_5_00157	Maybe he turned her down.
ACR_5_00158	Interesting, but I don't think so.
ACR_5_00159	Elizabeth used to be fearless\nwhen it came to guys.\n
ACR_5_00160	But these days, not so much.
ACR_5_00161	She hasn't been able to say\nanything to Tommy.
ACR_5_00162	Hm.
ACR_5_00163	Ugh. I wish she could just be\nhonest with him.
ACR_5_00164	Tommy deserves that.
ACR_5_00165	What if he doesn't feel the\nsame way?
ACR_5_00166	Then she should just try again.
ACR_5_00167	Like they say: If plan A doesn't\nwork, try plan A! ...Again!
ACR_5_00168	Oh, is that what they say?
ACR_5_00171	Oh well. It's out of our \nhands now.
ACR_5_00172	Let's wait in her room and give\nthem some space.
ACR_5_00173	Sure.
ACR_5_01363	Whoa... Total rich-girl energy\nin here, huh?
ACR_5_01364	It's all so clean. Is this room for\ndisplay only or something?
ACR_5_01365	She's never cleaned it herself,\nyou know. Cleaners come by.
ACR_5_01366	Must be nice being on the other\nside of the fence.
ACR_5_01367	Do you know this dog?
ACR_5_01368	That's Princess.
ACR_5_01369	The family dog.
ACR_5_01370	But Elizabeth's mom took her\nin the divorce.
ACR_5_01371	So Princess used to be\nElizabeth's pet?
ACR_5_01372	Oh man, that takes me back...\nElizabeth was so cute.
ACR_5_01373	Be that as it may...
ACR_5_01374	What do you think her\nallowance is?
ACR_5_01375	I mean, she has everything I've\never wanted.
ACR_5_01376	Pretty sure her dad just gets her\nwhatever she asks for.
ACR_5_01377	I cannot believe such a father\neven exists.
ACR_5_01378	She really hates him though.\nYou saw, right?
ACR_5_01379	They <color=#00994CFF>aren't getting along </color>at all\nlately. All they do is fight.
ACR_5_01380	But everyone hates their dad\nat one point or another.
ACR_5_01381	You're not wrong... But it's a bit\nmore complicated for Elizabeth.
ACR_5_01382	How so?
ACR_5_01383	It all started after <color=#00994CFF>her mom left</color>.
ACR_5_01384	Things between her and her dad\ngot pretty bad.
ACR_5_00202	Are they always like that?
ACR_5_00203	You have no idea. It's nonstop.
ACR_5_00204	She yells at her dad for the\nlittlest things.
ACR_5_00205	He has no idea how to handle it.\nTotally clueless.
ACR_5_00206	So he defaults to spending\nmoney on her.
ACR_5_00207	He just gets her whatever\nshe wants.
ACR_5_00208	Wow.
ACR_5_00209	But even then...
ACR_5_00210	It never seems to make her the\nslightest bit happier.
ACR_5_00211	Neither of them know what\nthey're doing.
ACR_5_00212	I get that. I fight with my dad\na lot too.
ACR_5_00213	Really?
ACR_5_00214	I think I get how Elizabeth feels.
ACR_5_00215	I mean, my dad never buys me\nanything.
ACR_5_00216	But he tries to make up for\nthings in his own awkward way.
ACR_5_00220	Elizabeth's mom left?
ACR_5_00221	Does that mean...
ACR_5_00222	Yeah. Her parents divorced like\nfive years ago.
ACR_5_00223	Adult stuff. I don't really know\nwhat was going on.
ACR_5_00224	But Elizabeth blames her dad.
ACR_5_00225	She does?
ACR_5_00226	What was her mom like?
ACR_5_00227	She was a singer. Did shows in\nLas Vegas or something.
ACR_5_00228	A singer?
ACR_5_00229	Yep. She was really beautiful.\nAmazing voice.
ACR_5_00230	Elizabeth bragged about her all\nthe time.
ACR_5_00231	So it really hit her super hard.
ACR_5_00232	What do you mean?
ACR_5_00233	Elizabeth loved her mom so much.\nBut after she left, no contact.
ACR_5_00234	Complete radio silence. Her mom\nhasn't even come back to visit.
ACR_5_00236	Hm...
ACR_5_00237	What's up?
ACR_5_00238	It's weird. At first, I thought we\nwere totally different.
ACR_5_00239	But we actually have a lot\nin common.
ACR_5_00241	Who does?
ACR_5_00242	Me and Elizabeth.
ACR_5_00244	Really?
ACR_5_00245	I don't have a mom either, so I \nget it.
ACR_5_00247	I ask myself all kinds of\nquestions.
ACR_5_00248	Why do I have to go through big\nlife stuff without her?
ACR_5_00249	Is it my fault she's gone?
ACR_5_00250	Things like that.
ACR_5_00254	I never thought about that.
ACR_5_00255	I guess I hadn't considered things\nfrom Elizabeth's perspective.
ACR_5_00256	It can be hard.
ACR_5_00260	Ah!
ACR_5_00261	Oh no! Is it broken?!
ACR_5_00262	What is it?
ACR_5_00264	Elizabeth's music box.
ACR_5_00265	It plays her mom's debut song.
ACR_5_00266	She used to play it all the time,\nbut I haven't seen it in a while.
ACR_5_00267	So she's had it since she was\nlittle? It must be really important\nto her.
ACR_5_00268	When her mom left, her dad\nthrew out all her stuff.
ACR_5_00269	This is the only thing Elizabeth\nstill has from her.
ACR_5_00270	I'll play it for you.
ACR_5_00272	I don't hear anything...
ACR_5_00273	Oh no! Did I break it?! ...What am\nI gonna do?
ACR_5_00274	I'm sure Elizabeth will understand\nit was an accident.
ACR_5_00275	No, she won't. She's never\ngonna forgive me...
ACR_5_00276	Seriously, what am I gonna do?
ACR_5_00278	Let me see it.
ACR_5_00282	That's it! You fixed it!
ACR_5_00283	This is a really pretty song.
ACR_5_00284	The song's great and all, but\nI'm just glad it's fixed.
ACR_5_00285	All that panicking was no good\nfor my skin.
ACR_5_01385	Here, you can have these\ntools back.
ACR_5_01386	Enough already!
ACR_5_01387	I don't want to talk about it!
ACR_5_01388	What do you think happened?
ACR_5_01389	Huh?
ACR_5_01390	Does this open?
ACR_5_01391	It's a birthday card...
ACR_5_01397	It's falling apart... Elizabeth has\nread this over and over again.
ACR_5_01398	It must be so precious to her...
ACR_5_01399	Hm?
ACR_5_01400	This is...
ACR_5_00322	Crap, Elizabeth's coming.
ACR_5_01401	What?
ACR_5_00336	...
ACR_5_00338	Elizabeth?
ACR_5_00339	Get out.
ACR_5_00340	What happened?
ACR_5_00341	I said, get out!
ACR_5_00343	Let's go, Ashley.
ACR_5_00344	Yeah.
ACR_5_00350	I guess something\nmajor happened.
ACR_5_00351	Let's go ask Tommy.
ACR_5_00354	Why did I bring this with me?!
ACR_5_01402	Tommy.
ACR_5_00362	What was the trouble?
ACR_5_00363	Well, we were just talking about\nthe band, but...
ACR_5_00360	I'm really sorry, Rex. I didn't see\nthat coming.
ACR_5_00361	I was just on my way out when I\nheard the yelling.
ACR_5_00365	We're back. Elizabeth kicked\nus out.
ACR_5_00366	Right, Ashley?
ACR_5_00369	Dude, she even kicked you\nguys out?
ACR_5_00370	What happened? You've gotta\ntell us.
ACR_5_00372	I just said that it felt like she was\nhiding something, and she—
ACR_5_00373	Hold up, you said what? What kind\nof play is that?
ACR_5_00374	If she could tell you, she already\nwould have.
ACR_5_00375	You can't just spring that on\nsomeone. Geez!
ACR_5_00380	Ashley...
ACR_5_00382	I'm sorry you had to see this.
ACR_5_00390	We're the ones who dropped by\nunexpectedly.
ACR_5_00391	Having friends visit should be\na happy occasion.
ACR_5_00392	Maybe she just didn't want\ncompany today.
ACR_5_00393	We all have days like that.
ACR_5_00394	That's a good perspective.
ACR_5_00395	Things sure are tough at\nyour age.
ACR_5_00397	I'm trying to meet her halfway.
ACR_5_01403	I remember those cuff links...
ACR_5_01404	Have I met this guy before?
ACR_5_01405	Ashley?
ACR_5_01406	I came here 13 years ago...
ACR_5_01407	Do you remember if we met then?
ACR_5_01408	No... We've never met.
ACR_5_01409	Oh...
ACR_5_01410	I've known Richard for quite\nsome time.
ACR_5_01411	He talks about you often.
ACR_5_00419	When did you meet?
ACR_5_00420	Right after he and Sayoko\ngraduated.
ACR_5_00421	You knew my mom too?
ACR_5_00422	Yes, back when J.C. Valley was\ncalled M.J. Labs.
ACR_5_00423	Judd Fitzgerald, the lab director,\nwent on to found J.C. Valley.
ACR_5_00424	We conducted research together\nfor the E.C. Project.
ACR_5_00425	So Elizabeth's dad knew my mom...
ACR_5_00428	Ashley?
ACR_5_00429	Huh? Yeah?
ACR_5_00430	Haha, sorry to bore you with my\nold stories.
ACR_5_00431	What's Richard up to?
ACR_5_00432	Is he waiting for you back at\nhis place?
ACR_5_00433	Nah, he got a call from the lab.
ACR_5_00434	He went to J.C. Valley?
ACR_5_00435	Yeah, he said there was some\nkind of system trouble.
ACR_5_00437	More trouble?
ACR_5_00438	I'll have to go check on\nthings later...
ACR_5_00441	Hey, guys. I think we've worn\nout our welcome. Let's head out.
ACR_5_00442	No kidding. It'll take Elizabeth a\nwhile to cool down.
ACR_5_00444	See you later!
ACR_5_00445	Thanks for having us.
ACR_5_00446	Yeah, thanks.
ACR_5_00447	Of course. I hope to see you\nagain soon.
ACR_5_00449	You think Elizabeth's gonna\nbe OK?
ACR_5_00450	Sorry we brought you into that.
ACR_5_00451	I don't think I helped much.
ACR_5_00452	I'm glad we had the\nbackup. Thanks.
ACR_5_00453	Later, Ashley.
ACR_5_00464	Open the door!
ACR_5_00461	Huh?
ACR_5_00465	Leave me alone!
ACR_5_00466	We're worried about you. Don't\nyou get that, Lizzie?
ACR_5_00467	Lizzie!
ACR_5_00468	Don't call me Lizzie!
ACR_5_00469	Only mom gets to call me that!
ACR_5_00471	They're back at it.
ACR_5_00472	This is gonna take a while.
ACR_5_00473	Eventually they'll calm down and\nshe'll send me some angry texts.
ACR_5_00474	Wanna kill time at Bob's while\nyou wait for those texts?
ACR_5_00475	Sure.
ACR_5_00476	Is that a typical father-daughter\nfight? Pretty intense...
ACR_5_00477	Oh no, the music player.
ACR_5_00478	I think they said they were going\nto Bob's.
ACR_5_00479	I'll catch up with them there.
ACR_5_01412	Hey, Ashley.
ACR_5_01413	Your friend get away from you?
ACR_5_01414	He's probably using the computer\nat my dad's cottage.
ACR_5_01415	Ahh, a gamer, huh?
ACR_5_01416	Yeah, I guess computer games\nare more fun than a diner.
ACR_5_01418	But if you wave a fresh salmon\nrice burger out the window...
ACR_5_01417	I bet he'd float over on the\nscent alone.
ACR_5_01419	Ha! The kid liked 'em that much,\ndid he?
ACR_5_01420	Yeah, he's totally in love with\nthose sandwiches.
ACR_5_01421	How old is he, anyway?
ACR_5_01422	He's 13.
ACR_5_01423	You don't say...
ACR_5_01424	Hm. That's <color=#00994CFF>good info</color>.
ACR_5_00482	Huh? What do you mean,\ngood info?
ACR_5_00484	Big news! My Salmon Rice Burger\nis a hit with the 13-year-old-boy\ndemographic!
ACR_5_00485	That's valuable marketing data.
ACR_5_00486	What?
ACR_5_00487	Consumer research is important\nin my line of work.
ACR_5_00488	And that's some key info, lemme\ntell ya.
ACR_5_00489	Is that so...
ACR_5_00490	Absolutely. It means the Salmon\nRice Burger has broad appeal.
ACR_5_00491	That settles it!
ACR_5_00492	That's the push I needed to start\nmy <color=#00994CFF>new business</color>!
ACR_5_00500	A new business?
ACR_5_00501	Yep! Selling my famous Salmon\nRice Burgers online.
ACR_5_00502	An online burger shop?
ACR_5_00503	That's right, miss.
ACR_5_00504	Hungry folks the world over will\nlove my Salmon Rice Burgers.
ACR_5_00505	What better way to deliver 'em\nto the masses?
ACR_5_00506	That's so cool! But can you\nship them?
ACR_5_00507	You bet. They don't lose flavor\nwhen frozen.
ACR_5_00508	Just toss one in the microwave\nand enjoy whenever.
ACR_5_00509	That sounds like a great plan.
ACR_5_00510	Thanks, Ashley. This is a big day!
ACR_5_00511	I'm committed. No more excuses!
ACR_5_00565	I can't believe it was inside the\nmusic box.
ACR_5_00566	Sorry.
ACR_5_00567	Don't worry. It's fine.
ACR_5_00568	Yeah. I'm glad you found it.
ACR_5_00569	It just doesn't make sense!
ACR_5_00570	Why would she hide it?
ACR_5_00572	...
ACR_5_00573	...
ACR_5_00574	...
ACR_5_00576	I haven't seen Elizabeth cry like\nthat in a long time.
ACR_5_00577	Tommy, what did you say to her?
ACR_5_00578	What did I say?
ACR_5_00581	I didn't think she'd start crying.
ACR_5_00582	And that's not all.
ACR_5_00583	You shoulda heard her.
ACR_5_00585	I kept asking why she wasn't\ncoming to practice...
ACR_5_00586	And she started spouting off\nsome nonsense.
ACR_5_00587	Said she didn't feel like it. That\nshe didn't have any fun singing.
ACR_5_00588	A total lie. Obviously.
ACR_5_00589	Elizabeth <color=#00994CFF>loves singing </color>more\nthan anything.
ACR_5_00590	Yeah. It was so clearly untrue,\nya know? It made me so mad.
ACR_5_00591	I started yelling. Told her to\ntell the truth.
ACR_5_00592	District Attorney Tommy, here\nto get to the bottom of things.
ACR_5_00593	She got so upset she started to\ncry. Guess what she said next...
ACR_5_00594	She said that I shouldn't force\nmyself to hang out with her.
ACR_5_00595	That she knows the truth, and\neveryone is laughing at her.
ACR_5_00596	What now?
ACR_5_00597	Seems like she's got it in her\nhead that she's a <color=#00994CFF>bad singer</color>.
ACR_5_00599	Say what?!
ACR_5_00600	Where is THAT coming from?
ACR_5_00601	Right? It's so wrong it's\nalmost funny.
ACR_5_00602	Please tell me you didn't laugh.
ACR_5_00603	Whoa, you think I'd laugh when\na friend's that upset?
ACR_5_00604	I told her that she was off base,\nbut she didn't listen.
ACR_5_00605	Her confidence is totally gone.\nShe just started crying.
ACR_5_00606	Unbelievable.
ACR_5_00607	That's how it all went down.
ACR_5_00614	Elizabeth loves singing\nthat much?
ACR_5_00615	Yeah. Ever since she was little.
ACR_5_00616	I have this memory from when\nwe were really young.
ACR_5_00617	She was listening to her mom's\nmusic box and humming along.
ACR_5_00618	She looked so happy.
ACR_5_00619	Sometimes she still does it. And\nwhen she does...
ACR_5_00620	she looks exactly like when she\nwas a kid.
ACR_5_00621	Elizabeth hates people seeing her\nlike that.
ACR_5_00622	I get that.
ACR_5_00623	Like, she loves music, but her\nmom's singing is special to her.
ACR_5_00625	There was...
ACR_5_00626	Hm?
ACR_5_00627	She said something else.
ACR_5_00628	She said she'd never be able to\nsing like her mother.
ACR_5_00633	She's not actually a bad\nsinger, right?
ACR_5_00634	No, not at all. She has a\nbeautiful voice.
ACR_5_00635	Yeah, she has such a unique\nsound. It's really cool.
ACR_5_00636	But she's convinced she's\nno good?
ACR_5_00637	It's super weird.
ACR_5_00638	For real. Totally strange.
ACR_5_00643	Ugh! What are we gonna do?
ACR_5_00644	We've gotta submit our\nsong to the contest...
ACR_5_00645	But we can't without a singer!
ACR_5_00648	Should we just give up?
ACR_5_00650	No way! We're entering no\nmatter what.
ACR_5_00651	Then we've gotta get her to\npractice. She message you yet?
ACR_5_00653	Not yet.
ACR_5_00654	Which means she won't\npick up if we call.
ACR_5_00656	Your song is on this, right?
ACR_5_00657	Yep. Give it a listen.
ACR_5_00658	OK...
ACR_5_00662	What'd you think?
ACR_5_00664	That's not bad. Actually,\nI really like it.
ACR_5_00666	I know, right?
ACR_5_00667	Rad!
ACR_5_00668	Elizabeth's voice isn't\nwhat I expected.
ACR_5_00669	Right? She's like a different\nperson when she sings.
ACR_5_00670	Totally different. It's unreal.
ACR_5_00671	I've never heard a voice like\nthat before.
ACR_5_00672	There's something about it.\nIt resonates.
ACR_5_00673	Like you feel it in your heart.
ACR_5_00674	Exactly!
ACR_5_00678	Bob's Food Hut!
ACR_5_00679	Absolutely. The usual?
ACR_5_00680	You got it. Delivery incoming.
ACR_5_00682	Hey kids. I'm heading out for a\nminute. Watch the diner for me.
ACR_5_00684	No prob, Bob.
ACR_5_00686	Unreliable bunch, the lot of 'em...
ACR_5_00733	I've gotta go. Matthew's waiting\nat my dad's place.
ACR_5_00734	Don't worry. We'll handle the\nmusic-player situation.
ACR_5_00735	Sorry for dragging you into this.
ACR_5_00736	See ya later.
ACR_5_00737	See ya!
ACR_5_01425	Matthew?
ACR_5_01426	Not here...
ACR_5_01427	Where did he go?
ACR_5_01428	Hm...
ACR_5_01429	His dad's briefcase is open...
ACR_5_01430	What was he looking for in here?
ACR_5_01431	This is...
ACR_5_01432	Is this Matthew's dad?
ACR_5_01433	And there next to him...
ACR_5_01434	John Smith?!
ACR_5_01435	Looks like that statue used to\nbe a big draw back in the day.
ACR_5_01436	Who's that in front of the\nclock tower?
ACR_5_01437	It's John...with that mean old\nlady from the garden!
ACR_5_01438	Wait, so that means she actually\ndoes know him?
ACR_5_01439	I bet Matthew saw this photo and\nwent to check it out.
ACR_5_00806	Why so surprised? I'm just\nwrapping up a delivery.
ACR_5_00807	Here?
ACR_5_00808	Yep. She'll deign to eat my\nfood if I bring it to her.
ACR_5_00809	I just wish she'd admit the Salmon\nRice Burger is delicious.
ACR_5_00810	What brings you around here?
ACR_5_00811	I'm looking for Matthew.
ACR_5_00815	I think he's probably at that\nmean— Uh, at that lady's house.
ACR_5_00816	Heh. You mean Charlotte?
ACR_5_00819	A word of caution if you're\npaying her a visit...
ACR_5_00820	She has a few rules and can get\nornery if they aren't followed.
ACR_5_00821	Rules?
ACR_5_00822	Yep. Rule one: Don't say anything\nto indicate her age.
ACR_5_00823	Don't call her "miss," no "ma'am,"\njust "Charlotte."
ACR_5_00824	Second, don't bring up <color=#00994CFF>her\ndaughter</color>, Olivia. Sore subject.
ACR_5_00825	And most important... Don't even\nmention <color=#00994CFF>the clock tower</color>.
ACR_5_00832	Charlotte has a daughter?
ACR_5_00833	A daughter who eloped and\nleft home.
ACR_5_00834	Wow, she eloped? That sounds\nlike something from TV.
ACR_5_00835	You said it.
ACR_5_00836	Olivia had been married\nbefore. It didn't end well.
ACR_5_00837	But she eventually fell in love\nwith someone new.
ACR_5_00838	She wanted to get hitched, but\nher mom put her foot down.
ACR_5_00839	Charlotte said the man would\nbreak her heart like the last one.
ACR_5_00840	But that didn't stop Olivia. She\njust couldn't stay away from <color=#00994CFF>him</color>.
ACR_5_00841	They wound up eloping and\nleaving town.
ACR_5_00842	Wow.
ACR_5_00843	Poor Charlotte hasn't said a\nword about her daughter since.
ACR_5_00850	Do you know anything about\nthe guy she ran off with?
ACR_5_00851	Yeah, this photographer who\nlived by the lake. Gilbert.
ACR_5_00852	Great guy. Sometimes he and\nOlivia would stop by the diner.
ACR_5_00853	It's a pity Charlotte couldn't see\nhim as anything but bad news.
ACR_5_00855	Must be the guy who lived in the\nhouse Matthew was hiding in.
ACR_5_00860	Why shouldn't I mention the\nclock tower to Charlotte?
ACR_5_00861	It's a real shame. That tower\nbrings up terrible memories.
ACR_5_00862	What terrible memories?
ACR_5_00863	Well...
ACR_5_00864	Charlotte's father had that clock\ntower built.
ACR_5_00865	His name was Benjamin. Really\nknew his way around a clock.
ACR_5_00866	Charlotte upheld his legacy by\ntaking good care of the tower.
ACR_5_00867	But she had to call it quits five\nyears ago. And who could blame\nher after what happened?
ACR_5_00868	What happened five years ago?
ACR_5_00870	It was a tragic accident. I don't\nlike to talk about it.
ACR_5_00871	In any case, Charlotte stopped\nthe clock and locked it up.
ACR_5_00872	That old tower hasn't\nbeen open since.
ACR_5_00878	Thanks, Bob. That's all good\nto know.
ACR_5_00879	Sure thing. Now don't forget\nthose rules, OK?
ACR_5_00880	I won't.
ACR_5_00881	Good. Now be sure you and your\nbuddy stop by the diner again!
ACR_5_00888	Do you like that, pretty girl?
ACR_5_00890	Um... Hello?
ACR_5_00892	Yes?
ACR_5_00894	You again? What do you\nwant now?
ACR_5_00898	Ruff, ruff!
ACR_5_00899	Is this your dog?
ACR_5_00900	No, but she does belong\nto someone I know.
ACR_5_00902	You lost, girl? You must be.
ACR_5_00903	She's been wandering around\nfor the last few days.
ACR_5_00904	I could see she was hungry,\nso I've been feeding her.
ACR_5_00906	Woof, woof!
ACR_5_00907	Princess?
ACR_5_00909	What is it? What are you doing?
ACR_5_00911	She's telling you to\nget in the house.
ACR_5_00912	What?
ACR_5_00915	Hurry up inside. I'm guessing\nthis one's with you?
ACR_5_00916	Huh?
ACR_5_00920	Matthew!
ACR_5_00921	...
ACR_5_00923	So this is where you've been.
ACR_5_00924	Apologies you had to find\nhim here, of all places.
ACR_5_00925	She's right, Ashley.\nDon't be rude.
ACR_5_00927	Matthew!
ACR_5_00929	I'm so sorry!
ACR_5_00930	That's not what I meant at all!
ACR_5_00931	You're just making it worse.\nIt was a joke.
ACR_5_00932	A joke?
ACR_5_00934	Do you want something\nto drink or not?
ACR_5_00935	Charlotte makes great tea.
ACR_5_00936	Uh, sure. I'd love a cup.
ACR_5_00937	Take a seat. I'll be right back.
ACR_5_00938	O-OK. Thank you.
ACR_5_00941	So, you were looking for me?
ACR_5_00942	Yeah, I was!
ACR_5_00943	Sorry... But I found something!\nProof sunglasses guy is involved!
ACR_5_00944	I saw the photo. Did you come\nhere looking for him?
ACR_5_00947	I already asked Charlotte, she\nsaid she doesn't know him.
ACR_5_00949	I told her I was sorry for barging\ninto her garden earlier.
ACR_5_00950	And once I apologized, she\ninvited me in for tea!
ACR_5_00951	Sounds like you've been busy.
ACR_5_00953	Here you go.
ACR_5_00954	Mm. This smells great!
ACR_5_00955	It's my own blend.
ACR_5_00956	Thank you.
ACR_5_00958	It tastes as good as it smells!
ACR_5_00959	Right?
ACR_5_00962	I like how you've decorated.
ACR_5_00963	It feels so warm and homey.
ACR_5_00964	I like to make things by hand.
ACR_5_00965	You made all this? No way!
ACR_5_00966	You must be able to make\nanything you want.
ACR_5_00968	Oh, I've heard that before...
ACR_5_00969	This one's father, <color=#00994CFF>Michael,\nvisited </color>me years ago.
ACR_5_00970	He said the same thing.
ACR_5_00971	You...knew my dad?
ACR_5_00983	Matthew's dad was here?
ACR_5_00984	Of course. Many times.
ACR_5_00985	I knew Michael when he was\njust a young boy.
ACR_5_00986	Really?!
ACR_5_00987	Can you tell me about him?
ACR_5_00989	Well, let's see... Michael was\nquite the troublemaker.
ACR_5_00990	I had to shoo him from my garden\nmore often than I cared to...
ACR_5_00991	Like me!
ACR_5_00992	Just like you. But, he never grew\nout of it. Always a troublemaker.
ACR_5_00993	He never found steady work, so\nhe spent his days lazing about.
ACR_5_00994	I was worried about\nhim, truth be told.
ACR_5_00995	But then he went and won the\nlottery, of all things.
ACR_5_00996	That's when he started his\nresort development company.
ACR_5_00997	To think, young Michael a CEO...
ACR_5_00999	I was against it, of course. I\ndidn't want tourists underfoot.
ACR_5_01000	But Michael...well.
ACR_5_01001	He was desperate to do it.\nI don't know why.
ACR_5_01002	It didn't end well. The town\nblamed him for <color=#00994CFF>polluting the lake</color>.
ACR_5_01003	His company was done for.\nI felt so bad for his poor kids.
ACR_5_01004	I'm just fine!
ACR_5_01005	No one needs to feel bad for me.
ACR_5_01006	None of it was even Dad's fault.
ACR_5_01007	The real bad guy did it\nand blamed my dad!
ACR_5_01010	Is that so? You believe\nin your father.
ACR_5_01017	You said I came here too,\nbut I don't remember at all.
ACR_5_01018	You were just a tiny little\nthing. I'm not surprised.
ACR_5_01019	I guess.
ACR_5_01020	It was right after my husband\ndied. He was a clock maker.
ACR_5_01021	He had been tending the clock\ntower, but with him gone...
ACR_5_01022	We would have to pay someone\nto keep it running.
ACR_5_01023	Then Michael Crusoe walks in\nmy door, young son in tow.
ACR_5_01024	So that's when I was here.
ACR_5_01025	That's right. Your father\nwas a kind man.
ACR_5_01026	He offered to pay for repairs\nto the clock tower.
ACR_5_01027	It was a very generous\noffer, but...
ACR_5_01028	Well. My stubbornness got the\nbetter of me. I turned him down.
ACR_5_01029	Michael said he understood, but\nhe seemed disappointed. He left...
ACR_5_01030	But not before having a slice\nof my raspberry cake.
ACR_5_01031	Did I have cake too?
ACR_5_01032	You bet you did. You\nwere all smiles.
ACR_5_01033	Hmm... Raspberry cake...
ACR_5_01035	I remember something.
ACR_5_01036	I had that cake... Dad was there.\nWe left and...got in the car.
ACR_5_01037	We stopped somewhere. He said\nhe had work and told me to wait.
ACR_5_01038	And...and he gave me a\ntoy car to play with.
ACR_5_01039	You remember all of that?
ACR_5_01040	Yeah... I remember coming\nhere with my dad.
ACR_5_01041	And after that...
ACR_5_01043	That's all I can remember.
ACR_5_01046	I'm sorry for bringing\nup those memories.
ACR_5_01047	You don't have to keep going.
ACR_5_01440	No, I need to remember.
ACR_5_01441	Not being able to remember is\nwhy I haven't found my dad yet.
ACR_5_01442	At least, that's the feeling I get...
ACR_5_01443	Matthew...
ACR_5_01049	Could you tell us what you know\nabout the pollution?
ACR_5_01444	Hmm... That would have been\nabout five years ago.
ACR_5_01050	All the hubbub began when the\nresort started bringing tourists.
ACR_5_01051	A newspaper claimed the\nlake was being polluted...
ACR_5_01052	Hm. Thinking back, that\nwas quite strange.
ACR_5_01053	What was?
ACR_5_01054	People loved the idea of the\nresort at first.
ACR_5_01055	The town backed the whole plan.
ACR_5_01056	And then that article came out.
ACR_5_01057	Crusoe Resort was not named as\nthe cause of the pollution.
ACR_5_01058	But all of a sudden, folks\nchanged their minds. Got angry.
ACR_5_01059	They blamed your father's\ncompany.
ACR_5_01060	That's weird.
ACR_5_01061	It is. Soon, everyone had turned\nagainst Crusoe Resort.
ACR_5_01062	Suddenly it was "Protect our\nlake" this and "Get out" that.
ACR_5_01063	The tourists disappeared as\nquickly as they had come.
ACR_5_01064	I've never seen anything like it.\nOne day, folks supported him.
ACR_5_01065	The next day, they were dead set\nagainst him. It was eerie.
ACR_5_01066	All the while they acted like they\nwere being downright noble. Pah.
ACR_5_01067	They're all newcomers to me.\nNo leg to stand on.
ACR_5_01068	Did you ever think Michael\nmight be guilty?
ACR_5_01069	Not once.
ACR_5_01070	We had different opinions about\nthe development, of course.
ACR_5_01071	But I know Michael.
ACR_5_01072	Someone who would check\nin on an old lady.
ACR_5_01073	That man wouldn't harm the\nlake for his own ends.
ACR_5_01074	He was never the villain\nthey made him out to be.
ACR_5_01075	If you could remember how he\nlooked at you. Such love.
ACR_5_01445	Wait... We've met? You already\nknew me from back then?
ACR_5_01077	Of course. I met you when you\n<color=#00994CFF>came here with Michael</color>.
ACR_5_01078	Really?!
ACR_5_01446	But it seems like you may\nhave forgotten.
ACR_5_01091	When was the last time you\nsaw Matthew's dad?
ACR_5_01092	Hmm. It's been quite a while now.
ACR_5_01093	I saw him in town during all\nthat unpleasantness.
ACR_5_01094	He'd stopped visiting by then.
ACR_5_01095	I haven't seen him since all\nthat trouble.
ACR_5_01096	He went missing after that.\nWe're looking for him.
ACR_5_01097	Is that so?
ACR_5_01098	Yeah. I'm gonna find him\nand prove he's innocent.
ACR_5_01099	Ashley's helping me look.
ACR_5_01100	That is quite the pickle.
ACR_5_01101	Now I wanna go to the clock\ntower to find him.
ACR_5_01103	What did you say?
ACR_5_01104	Oh no! You're not supposed to\nbring up the clock tower!
ACR_5_01106	Huh?
ACR_5_01108	Crap...
ACR_5_01111	Why do you want to go to the\nclock tower? Michael isn't there.
ACR_5_01112	We—
ACR_5_01115	There's something about the\nclock tower.
ACR_5_01116	I feel like I've forgotten\nsomething important.
ACR_5_01117	Maybe if I remember, I'll\nbe able to find my dad.
ACR_5_01119	Do you really believe that?
ACR_5_01120	Yeah.
ACR_5_01121	I'm a little scared...but I\nwanna know the truth.
ACR_5_01123	Hmm.
ACR_5_01125	Charlotte, please.\nLet us take a look.
ACR_5_01126	We've talked about it.
ACR_5_01127	Facing the truth can be hard,\nbut it's always for the best.
ACR_5_01129	You're pretty determined, huh?
ACR_5_01131	Fine. You can look inside\nthe clock tower.
ACR_5_01133	However...
ACR_5_01135	You're going to need three keys.
ACR_5_01136	There are three keys?
ACR_5_01137	Indeed there are.
ACR_5_01138	Each key represents a part of\nour family crest. A sword, a\nmoon, and a flower.
ACR_5_01139	They've been passed down in my\nfamily for generations.
ACR_5_01140	Members of the Graham family\ncarried each one separately.
ACR_5_01141	My father Benjamin, my husband\nRobin, and my daughter Olivia.
ACR_5_01143	My husband passed away, and\nOlivia left home.
ACR_5_01447	Robin used to store things in the\ntoolshed, but...
ACR_5_01448	I'm not sure where Olivia may\nhave put hers.
ACR_5_01144	I guess what I'm saying is I don't\nreally know where the keys have\ngotten off to.
ACR_5_01146	So, if we find the three keys...
ACR_5_01148	Then you may do as you wish.
ACR_5_01154	Man, three keys for one\nclock tower?
ACR_5_01155	Charlotte's husband's key and\nher daughter's...
ACR_5_01156	Where could they be?
ACR_5_01157	Well, she said her husband kept\nthings in the toolshed.
ACR_5_01158	Let's check there first.
ACR_5_01568	All right, we got a key!
ACR_5_01569	Wow, great job!
ACR_5_01570	Oh, thanks.
ACR_5_01571	Let's tell Charlotte.
ACR_5_01572	Right.
ACR_5_01449	Hey, Charlotte.
ACR_5_01450	Find the keys yet?
ACR_5_01451	We found the sword key.
ACR_5_01452	Thanks for telling us where\nto look.
ACR_5_01453	I didn't tell you anything. You\nfound it all on your own.
ACR_5_01454	Let's look for Olivia's key next.
ACR_5_01455	Do you have any clues for where\nit might be?
ACR_5_01456	Now that you mention it...
ACR_5_01457	Olivia left something strange in\nthe greenhouse.
ACR_5_01458	A wooden box with an image of\na flower on it...
ACR_5_01459	There's something funny about\nit, but I never figured out what.
ACR_5_01460	Come on, Ashley, let's go check\nit out.
ACR_5_01461	Right.
ACR_5_01170	It's so hot...
ACR_5_01171	What was Olivia doing here\nbefore she left?
ACR_5_01172	Let's take a look around.
ACR_5_01175	Right. The box should be\nsomewhere in here.
ACR_5_01191	"Dear Mom"?
ACR_5_01194	A letter?
ACR_5_01195	Yeah, left by Olivia.
ACR_5_01196	I bet Charlotte's never read it.
ACR_5_01197	We should deliver it.
ACR_5_01198	But what about the key?
ACR_5_01199	Charlotte's been in the dark for\nso long. We should do this now.
ACR_5_01200	We'll look for the key\nright after?
ACR_5_01201	Of course.
ACR_5_01462	Charlotte.
ACR_5_01463	Find the key?
ACR_5_01464	Not yet...
ACR_5_01465	But we did find this.
ACR_5_01466	What is it?
ACR_5_01467	A letter left by Olivia. It was\nin the greenhouse.
ACR_5_01468	Olivia...
ACR_5_01469	I wonder what she wrote...
ACR_5_01470	Are you sure it's OK for me\nto read it?
ACR_5_01231	Dear Mom,\n\nI'm sorry for leaving without\nsaying anything.\n\nI felt like if I had told you, you\nnever would have approved of\nme leaving home, or of my\nrelationship with Gilbert.\n\nNone of this was his idea,\nso please don't blame him.\n\nIt was all me.\n\nIn fact, he tried talking me\nout of it, right up until I left.\n\nYou were worried I'd get\nmy heart broken again...\nBut I'm fine.\n\nI know I can find happiness with Gilbert.\n\nIt's why I decided to leave with him.\n\nBut there's another reason\nI couldn't tell you...\n\nI'm pregnant.\n\nWhat matters to me most was\nto give this child a chance to\nlive in a happy home.\n\nAnd for that, I needed a\nfresh start with Gilbert.\n\nI know that as a mother, you\nunderstand how important that is.\n\nThere's nothing more important\nthan your child's happiness.\n\nSo, please understand...\n\nMy leaving is not Gilbert's\nfault, and it's not yours.\n\nThe only one to blame is me.\n\nIf you can find it in your heart to\nforgive me, then I would love for\nyou to meet your grandchild.\n\nA child should know the\nlove of their grandmother.\n\nI wish you good health and a long life.\n\nWith love,\n\nOlivia
ACR_5_01471	Olivia had a baby?
ACR_5_01472	Congratulations, Charlotte!\nYou're a grandma!
ACR_5_01473	So it would seem...
ACR_5_01474	Olivia... If only you'd spoken a\nword of this to me...
ACR_5_01475	Hmph. I might have become even\nmore obstinate.
ACR_5_01476	It's a key!
ACR_5_01477	It's Olivia's flower key. It was\ninside the letter.
ACR_5_01478	Take it.
ACR_5_01479	Are you sure?
ACR_5_01480	Yes. Thank you for bringing me\nOlivia's letter.
ACR_5_01481	Of course. Thank you, Charlotte.
ACR_5_01265	There's only one more.
ACR_5_01266	Right. We've got this.
ACR_5_01267	Yeah.
ACR_5_01268	No need to keep searching.
ACR_5_01270	Huh?
ACR_5_01272	Here.
ACR_5_01273	The moon key?
ACR_5_01274	You had it the whole time?
ACR_5_01276	Hurry up and take it before\nI change my mind.
ACR_5_01277	We won't lose it!
ACR_5_01280	Thanks again, Charlotte.
ACR_5_01282	Ashley...
ACR_5_01283	When you gave me\nOlivia's letter, I...
ACR_5_01284	I learned her true feelings\nfor the first time.
ACR_5_01285	Thank you.
ACR_5_01286	I'm glad I could help.
ACR_5_01287	Never knowing the truth is a far\nworse fate...
ACR_5_01288	I never thought I'd learn\nthat from a child.
ACR_5_01290	Olivia was heartbroken after her\nfirst marriage ended.
ACR_5_01291	She shut down. She wouldn't\nopen up to anyone.
ACR_5_01292	Not even me.
ACR_5_01293	But she came back home,\nto this beautiful place.
ACR_5_01294	Lake Juliet mended her heart\none piece at a time.
ACR_5_01295	Then, as soon as she seemed\nwhole again, that man arrived.
ACR_5_01296	At first, Olivia ignored him.
ACR_5_01297	He tried to win her affection,\nbut she wouldn't budge.
ACR_5_01298	She no longer believed that\nsomeone could love her.
ACR_5_01299	But he didn't give up. And before\nI knew it, she was in love.
ACR_5_01300	Why were you against\nthem getting married?
ACR_5_01301	That man came from the city\nlike he was blown by the wind.
ACR_5_01302	If he moved here on a whim,\nwas his love also a whim?
ACR_5_01303	I had seen Olivia tortured\nby a broken heart.
ACR_5_01304	I was set on protecting her from\nthe idle desires of a fickle man.
ACR_5_01305	But the whole time, it seems I\nnever understood.
ACR_5_01307	Now, I just truly hope\nthat she's happy.
ACR_5_01308	You should tell her that yourself.
ACR_5_01309	At this point? No... It's too late.
ACR_5_01310	Why?
ACR_5_01311	You could just give her a call.
ACR_5_01312	Well, but... That would...
ACR_5_01313	I just don't get why you would\nhesitate at your age.
ACR_5_01315	Ah!
ACR_5_01316	Heh. You're fine.
ACR_5_01317	I know that you just see me as\nan old lady.
ACR_5_01318	But age doesn't make it easier\nto admit you were wrong.
ACR_5_01319	That sounds rough.
ACR_5_01320	Indeed.
ACR_5_01482	I have a favor to ask of you two.
ACR_5_01483	What is it?
ACR_5_01484	I want you to get the clock\ntower running.
ACR_5_01485	I'd like to hear the bell's\nchime again.
ACR_5_01486	We'll give it a shot.
ACR_5_01321	Well, you have your keys.\nSo off you go.
ACR_5_01487	The moon key will get you into\nthe clock tower. Got it?
ACR_5_01322	We'll be back.
ACR_5_01323	Let's go, Matthew.
ACR_5_01324	Right behind you.
ACR_5_01326	Do you really think we can get\nthe clock tower working again?
ACR_5_01327	Maybe.
ACR_5_01329	It's been years since I heard\nthat bell.
ACR_5_01330	Oh, Olivia. I remember how much\nyou loved to hear it ring.
ACR_5_01334	Got it!
ACR_5_01335	Hm...
ACR_5_01337	What's wrong, Matthew?
ACR_5_01338	It's just...that...
ACR_5_01361	*sigh*
ACR_5_01339	Is it scary?
ACR_5_01342	These are my magic words.
ACR_5_01343	"Even though facing the truth can be hard..."
ACR_5_01498	"in the end, it's always for the best."
ACR_5_01344	You've said that before.
ACR_5_01345	I have.
ACR_5_01346	It's something a friend taught me.
ACR_5_01347	When I was trying to figure out\nwhat happened to my mom...
ACR_5_01348	Those words gave me the\nstrength to learn the truth.
ACR_5_01349	You think they'll help me?
ACR_5_01351	I know it.
ACR_5_01574	(Exert Noise)
ACR_5_01353	"Even though facing the truth can be hard..."
ACR_5_01499	"in the end, it's always for the best."
ACR_5_01362	...
ACR_5_01575	(Exert Noise)
ACR_5_01357	D, look out for him.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00002	I wonder what's going on.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00006	Why won't it play?
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00007	What's up with it?
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00008	It looks like it has a few\nbroken parts.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00087	Oh crap! We're screwed!
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00088	I could fix it if I had the\nright tools.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00089	Will this help? It's the repair kit\nfor my drum set.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00090	Thanks! I'll just borrow these\nfor a bit.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00091	Fixing it with these should be\nno problem.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00026	It's stuck. I can't wind it.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00027	Maybe a peek inside will\ntell me why.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00092	Well, it plays music, but it sounds\nall sorts of weird.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00093	There must be something else\ngoing on with it.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00030	Maybe it needs to be wound up\na bit more.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00031	I should wind it up first.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00033	It's a little rusty...
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00038	All cleaned up. Hopefully that\ndoes the trick.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00039	It's a lot cleaner now.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00042	Pliers could break the whole\ngear. Better not.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00043	No way a screwdriver could\nremove rust...
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00044	No way a screwdriver could\nremove rust...
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00045	Guess I should have figured a\nhex wrench wouldn't work.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00046	This would only make the\nrust worse.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00047	The screw is stuck. I can't get it\nout with my fingers.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00048	I hope that did it.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00049	If only I could remove the screw\njust by spraying it...
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00051	Using this might break some\nother parts.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00052	Using this might break some\nother parts.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00053	The wrench is too big.\nIt'll never work.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00054	Why does she carry bug spray\nin here?
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00055	This screw is loose. That can't\nbe helping any.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00056	This is the only spot missing\na screw.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00085	This screw is loose here...
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00057	Maybe it'll play now.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00086	OK, nice and tight.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00058	It still won't play... What else\ncould be wrong?
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00059	It's playing, but it sounds\npretty weird...
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00060	There might be something else\nthat needs fixing.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00061	All right, now I can get it to play\nsome music.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00062	I've gotta fix the music box.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00063	If Elizabeth finds out that her\nmusic box is broken...
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00072	This isn't it. I've gotta tighten\nthe screw.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00074	This would totally destroy\nthe screw.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00075	The screw hole is a\ndifferent shape.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00076	I can't turn it with this.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00077	Is Janet a bug magnet\nor something?
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00078	There isn't even any rust.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00080	No point in using this.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00081	If I want to turn this screw, the\nscrewdriver I should use is...
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00082	No point in using this.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00083	Are bugs attracted to drums?\nThat can't be right.
ACR_Mystery_5_1_00084	This isn't it.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00002	There's a box under the table,\ntoward the back.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00003	Can you reach it?
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00004	I think so.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00006	The box won't open.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00007	There's a rose carved onto\nthe lid.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00033	It's just like Charlotte said.\nThis has to be Olivia's, right?
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00034	Yeah. Let's get it open.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00008	Huh. There's a little maze.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00011	Let's try to open it up.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00016	Let's look for the box that Olivia\nleft behind.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00035	Let's solve the box's puzzle.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00038	This is trickier than I thought\nit would be...
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00039	Where's the box Olivia\nleft behind?
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00040	Let's look around here.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00041	There's a shelf of potted plants.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00042	Nothing that looks like a box\naround here.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00043	So many flowerpots... This must\ntake a ton of work.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00044	The shelf holds colorful flowerpots.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00045	This was used for the plants.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00046	There's a watering can.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00024	Are these pots for transplanting\nflowers?
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00047	There are empty pots.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00031	The bucket's empty.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00048	There's an old bucket.
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00049	It fell into a hole, but it must\nhave been the wrong one.\nHow can I clear this?
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00050	There's a rose mark... Is that\nthe goal?
ACR_Mystery_5_4_00051	Ugh, failure.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00002	Cool, a miniature version of the\nclock tower.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00003	There's a door at the bottom...
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00005	This mark looks like a sword.\nMaybe there's something inside.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00006	Won't open... How can I get\nin there?
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00091	The area around the desk is littered\nwith clocks.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00092	There's a shelf with three clocks.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00007	The clock-tower key may be\nin here. I should look for it\nsome more.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00009	Huh... This part's a lid.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00010	So this part opens up.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00012	The hands look like they can\nbe moved...
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00022	I don't need to adjust this\nany more.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00023	I should move the clock hands.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00027	Huh? I heard something when I\nset the clock to this time.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00028	Maybe there's something more\nto this clock.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00029	It makes a sound when the clock\nis set to the right time.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00030	I should set the time on the other\ntwo clocks.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00031	Just one more.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00032	OK, all four clocks have been set.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00033	The key was in there after all.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00035	Hmm... What should I do?
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00036	What time should I set the\nclocks to?
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00037	The letter E is above the dial.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00039	The letter N is above the dial.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00041	The letter W is above the dial.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00043	The letter S is above the dial.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00049	Add S and N to get E?
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00050	Like, addition? That's some basic\narithmetic.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00051	"S+N=E" is carved into the drawer.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00052	What do I need to do to\nopen this?
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00054	Wasn't this N also on\nthe miniature?
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00056	There's a letter carved here.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00057	The letter N has been carved into the shelf.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00095	Looks like it says...3:52?
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00096	The time on the clock is set to 3:52.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00097	Nothing looks all that out of\nthe ordinary.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00059	Looks like it says...4:25?
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00060	Doesn't look like the clock's\nworking. Must be broken.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00098	Looks like it says...3:37?
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00099	The time on the clock is set to 3:37.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00100	Nothing looks all that out of\nthe ordinary.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00061	The time on the clock is set to 4:25.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00101	Looks like it says...7:21?
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00102	The time on the clock is set to 7:21.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00103	Looks like it says...11:56?
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00104	The time on the clock is set to 11:56.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00064	This clock's strange... It has\nthree dials.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00065	Let's see... The left one is set\nto 6:05.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00066	The middle one is 3:20, and the\nright one is 8:15.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00071	There's a table clock with 3 dials.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00072	The left dial is set to 6:05.\nThe middle dial is set to 3:20.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00073	The right dial is set to 8:15.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00075	There's an S carved into this.\nWas it on the miniature too?
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00078	The letter S has been carved into the shelf.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00082	This table clock has a handle.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00083	Its time is set to 1:30.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00084	There's a table clock with a handle. The time\nis set to 1:30.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00086	There's a W carved into this.\nWas it on the miniature too?
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00090	The letter W has been carved inside\nthe drawer.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00105	It's set to 5:54.
ACR_Mystery_5_5_00106	The time is set to 5:54.
ACR_Mystery_5_7_00001	Charlotte said the moon key will\nopen it, right?
ACR_Mystery_5_7_00002	Not this key.
ACR_Mystery_5_7_00003	It needs the moon key.
ACR_Mystery_5_7_00008	This isn't it.
ACR_6_Scenario_00004	Boards are nailed up between\nthe pillars.
ACR_6_Scenario_00005	I thought we'd be able to see\noutside from here.
ACR_6_Scenario_00009	There's a trace of the yellow tape that used\nto be stuck here.
ACR_6_Scenario_00010	This looks like...
ACR_6_Scenario_00011	It's caution tape. Like what\nthe police use.
ACR_6_Scenario_00012	Did something happen here?
ACR_6_Scenario_00013	There's a trace of the yellow tape that used\nto be stuck here.
ACR_6_Scenario_00014	Did something happen here?
ACR_6_Scenario_00015	There's a child's drawing on the pillar.\nThere are different designs on the top\nand bottom.
ACR_6_Scenario_00067	Matthew and Kelly must have\ndrawn this.
ACR_6_Scenario_00068	There's some drawing here.
ACR_6_Scenario_00069	There are drawings on the pillar. They look like\nthe works of children.
ACR_6_Scenario_00084	I walked past Matthew. He was\nnear the covered bridge.
ACR_6_Scenario_00085	You should go find him.
ACR_6_Scenario_00086	See ya, Princess.
ACR_6_Scenario_00087	Woof!
ACR_6_Scenario_00088	Woof!
ACR_6_Scenario_00091	Hey, Ashley. Looking to\nbuy something?
ACR_6_Scenario_00092	Man, I wanna get back to\nband practice!
ACR_6_Scenario_00071	Closed today... Can't get through.
ACR_6_Scenario_00072	The kid ran off toward\nCharlotte's house.
ACR_6_Scenario_00073	Charlotte!
ACR_6_Scenario_00074	Look after the boy.
ACR_6_Scenario_00028	Something tells me Matthew\ndidn't come this way.
ACR_6_Scenario_00029	I've gotta find Matthew.
ACR_6_Scenario_00030	There's a faded sign at the building's entrance.
ACR_6_Scenario_00031	Crusoe Resort
ACR_6_Scenario_00035	Look at all this stuff. No way can\nI get past it.
ACR_6_Scenario_00036	The door is locked.
ACR_6_Scenario_00039	It's a newspaper article from 5 years ago.
ACR_6_Scenario_00041	The door is locked.
ACR_6_Scenario_00042	This is File Storage, right?
ACR_6_Scenario_00043	I gotta find Matthew.
ACR_6_Scenario_00044	I think he's in this building.
ACR_6_Scenario_00082	I should look around a little more.
ACR_6_Scenario_00065	Did Matthew do this graffiti?
ACR_6_Scenario_00066	There's more graffiti over here.
ACR_6_Scenario_00051	The door is locked.
ACR_6_Scenario_00075	No good. It's locked.
ACR_6_Scenario_00076	I'll look around over here. You\nlook somewhere else.
ACR_6_Scenario_00077	It's a concept drawing of Crusoe Resort.
ACR_6_Scenario_00078	The drawers are all empty.
ACR_6_Scenario_00079	The drawers are empty.
ACR_6_Scenario_00080	The cabinet's empty. I don't see\nanything helpful anywhere.
ACR_6_Scenario_00081	The cabinet is empty.
ACR_6_Scenario_00083	Was there anything in\nthe locker?
ACR_6_Scenario_00089	Dad's waiting... I should head to\nthe lab for now.
ACR_6_00007	It's so dusty in here.
ACR_6_00008	I bet no one's been inside this\nplace for years.
ACR_6_00009	...
ACR_6_00021	Do you remember anything?
ACR_6_00022	I don't know...
ACR_6_00023	But I...have been here before.
ACR_6_00027	Maybe looking around will jog\nyour memory.
ACR_6_00028	Mhm.
ACR_6_00029	Still scared?
ACR_6_00030	Honestly, yeah.
ACR_6_00031	But I have to remember.
ACR_6_00032	Even though facing the truth\ncan be hard...
ACR_6_00033	in the end, it's always for\nthe best.
ACR_6_00034	in the end, it's always for\nthe best.
ACR_6_00036	OK. Let's take a look around.
ACR_6_00037	Right.
ACR_6_00739	Do these stairs go on forever,\nor what?
ACR_6_00741	Whoa, check it out. You can see\nthe clock faces!
ACR_6_00744	This thing is huge.
ACR_6_00748	There's a ladder. I guess it goes\neven higher.
ACR_6_00752	Matthew, there's a bell up there!
ACR_6_00754	Matthew?
ACR_6_00755	I just...remembered something...
ACR_6_00757	I brought Kelly here... A long\ntime ago.
ACR_6_00758	Kelly's your little sister, right?
ACR_6_00759	Yeah. The clock tower wasn't\nlocked up back then.
ACR_6_00760	Kelly loved it here. She said it\nwas like a secret hideout.
ACR_6_00761	I made a deal with her when we\nplayed up here.
ACR_6_00762	What deal?
ACR_6_00763	When the bell rang six o'clock,\nit was time to stop playing.
ACR_6_00764	But then we'd go meet Dad at\nhis office...
ACR_6_00765	and the three of us together\nwould go home and see Mom.
ACR_6_00766	I see.
ACR_6_00767	It's great that you remembered\nall that.
ACR_6_00768	Sure, but why just that? I can't\neven remember where my\ndad worked.
ACR_6_00769	Even though Kelly and I would\nwalk to his office all the time.
ACR_6_00770	It's OK. I'm sure you'll remember\nsome more soon.
ACR_6_00772	Maybe hearing the bell will jog\nsome more memories.
ACR_6_00773	Like where my dad's office is or\nhow to get there.
ACR_6_00774	It's worth a shot.
ACR_6_00775	Let's try to give it a ring.
ACR_6_00062	All right, the clock's working!
ACR_6_00063	We did it!
ACR_6_00065	Look, it's almost six.
ACR_6_00066	And when it strikes six...
ACR_6_00067	Then what?
ACR_6_00068	Won't the bell ring?
ACR_6_00069	Oh yeah.
ACR_6_00071	Do you want to watch it ring\nfrom up close?
ACR_6_00073	Best seats in the house, right?
ACR_6_00074	...
ACR_6_00086	That's OK. I'll...stay down here.
ACR_6_00088	Scared of heights?
ACR_6_00089	No, it's not that... Why don't you\ngo on ahead?
ACR_6_00093	Sure. Wait here for me.
ACR_6_00096	OK...
ACR_6_01187	(Exert Noise)
ACR_6_01188	(Exert Noise)
ACR_6_01189	(Exert Noise)
ACR_6_01175	(Exert Noise)
ACR_6_01176	(Exert Noise)
ACR_6_01177	(Exert Noise)
ACR_6_01178	(Exert Noise)
ACR_6_01179	(Exert Noise)
ACR_6_00151	Whew, it's over.
ACR_6_00152	I didn't think it'd be so loud.
ACR_6_00153	I bet Charlotte heard it too.
ACR_6_00796	I wonder if it helped jog\nMatthew's memory.
ACR_6_00801	Huh?
ACR_6_00803	Matthew?
ACR_6_00805	He's gone...
ACR_6_00807	Matthew!
ACR_6_00810	What's this?
ACR_6_00813	This picture...
ACR_6_00814	It's Matthew's family in front of\nCrusoe Resort.
ACR_6_00816	This must mean...
ACR_6_00817	he remembered where his dad's\noffice is.
ACR_6_00818	He must have gone to check\nit out.
ACR_6_00819	I need to go after him.
ACR_6_00825	Woof!
ACR_6_00827	Oh, Princess!
ACR_6_00167	So we meet again.
ACR_6_00170	Uh...
ACR_6_00171	What?
ACR_6_00173	Uh, nothing. I should go.
ACR_6_00175	Woof!
ACR_6_00177	She likes you. She used to be\nshy around people.
ACR_6_00180	Hey, Princess. Have you seen\nMatthew?
ACR_6_00182	...
ACR_6_00183	No? OK...
ACR_6_00184	How about you, Elizabeth?\nHave you seen him?
ACR_6_00185	I passed him on the\ncovered bridge.
ACR_6_00187	The covered bridge? Thanks.
ACR_6_00189	Uh...
ACR_6_00191	I...guess I'll get going.
ACR_6_00193	Hey. Can I talk to you?
ACR_6_00197	Did...something happen?
ACR_6_00199	My dad is getting married again.
ACR_6_00201	Oh, really?
ACR_6_00202	To the worst kind of woman.
ACR_6_00203	That sounds rough.
ACR_6_00204	Oh, Dad... Why'd you have to fall\nfor that drama queen Sofia?
ACR_6_00205	Sofia? Right, she was at\nthe cookout.
ACR_6_00206	Wait, did she just diss someone\nfor being a drama queen?!
ACR_6_00207	What's with that look?
ACR_6_00208	It's nothing. So you don't\nlike her?
ACR_6_00209	I can't stand her. She just seems\nso...sketchy.
ACR_6_00210	Sketchy? Like how?
ACR_6_00211	It's hard to explain, but...
ACR_6_00212	I don't even think she loves\nmy dad.
ACR_6_00213	Uh-oh.
ACR_6_00214	But he's crazy about her. I was\ntrying to deal with all that...
ACR_6_00215	when Janet had the idea to\nenter this contest.
ACR_6_00216	I thought it might help me get my\nmind off things, so I said sure.
ACR_6_00217	For the record, I think your\nband could totally win.
ACR_6_00218	No way. Tommy's great on guitar,\nand Janet's a solid drummer...
ACR_6_00219	but my voice is awful. That will\nkill any chance we might have.
ACR_6_00220	I'm not like my mom. My voice is\nnothing special.
ACR_6_00221	That's not true!
ACR_6_00222	I've heard you sing. You're\namazing!
ACR_6_00224	Wait. You've heard me sing?
ACR_6_00226	Uhhh... I mean...
ACR_6_00227	You're the one who took the\nmusic player, aren't you?
ACR_6_00228	You knew?
ACR_6_00229	Of course. I saw that my music\nbox had been moved.
ACR_6_00230	Sorry...
ACR_6_00231	But it was a really good song.\nI loved your vocals.
ACR_6_00232	I've been wanting to hear\nit again.
ACR_6_00233	You're a bad liar.
ACR_6_00234	Why would I lie about that?\nTo make you feel better?
ACR_6_00236	Yeah... I guess not.
ACR_6_00237	Tommy and Janet said the same. \nThey think your singing is great.
ACR_6_00238	But...
ACR_6_00239	You've gotta stop comparing\nyour voice to your mom's.
ACR_6_00241	However much you love her\nsongs, those are hers to sing.
ACR_6_00242	And your songs are yours.
ACR_6_00243	It's apples and oranges.
ACR_6_00244	Ashley... Thanks.
ACR_6_00246	Phew. Glad I got that off\nmy chest.
ACR_6_00247	It feels good to let it all out.
ACR_6_00250	Well, not everything has to be\nabout you, y'know.
ACR_6_00252	I feel better now that I've\ntalked it out too.
ACR_6_00255	You know...
ACR_6_00256	I thought you were immature,\neven if you are older than me.
ACR_6_00257	Oh... Well, that was, um... I may\nhave lied a little about that.
ACR_6_00258	What? Why would you lie\nabout that?
ACR_6_00260	I'm only 16. I guess I was trying\nto seem cool.
ACR_6_00262	That's stupid.
ACR_6_00263	Sorry...
ACR_6_00265	It's OK. I don't care.
ACR_6_00266	I feel better knowing you're a\nlittle vain too.
ACR_6_00267	What?! Look who's talking!
ACR_6_00268	Hehe.
ACR_6_00270	We may be the same age, but\nyou're more mature.
ACR_6_00271	You think things through. And\nyou don't complain.
ACR_6_00272	That's not true.
ACR_6_00273	I complain so much. Just about\ndifferent things than you.
ACR_6_00274	Yeah, yeah. I know. You're so\nargumentative too.
ACR_6_00275	What?! I am not!
ACR_6_00276	Hehe.
ACR_6_00280	Well, I really should go.
ACR_6_00281	OK.
ACR_6_00282	Oh, wait.
ACR_6_00283	Do you know where Matthew's\ndad's office is?
ACR_6_00284	You mean the Crusoe Resort\noffices? Yeah.
ACR_6_00286	Go through the J.C. Valley gate,\nthen it's just straight ahead.
ACR_6_00287	But the gate may be closed\nif J.C. Valley is too.
ACR_6_00288	Thanks, Elizabeth.
ACR_6_00289	See ya.
ACR_6_00292	Maybe she's right...
ACR_6_00293	I have my own songs to sing.
ACR_6_00834	Hey, Ashley.
ACR_6_00835	Hey, Bob.
ACR_6_00836	I'm looking for Matthew. Have\nyou seen him?
ACR_6_00837	Actually, he just ran right\npast me.
ACR_6_00839	Turned the corner off toward\nCharlotte's house.
ACR_6_00840	Got it. Thanks!
ACR_6_00844	Oh, Ashley.
ACR_6_00845	You got the clock going again,\ndidn't you?
ACR_6_00846	It was wonderful to hear the\nbell chiming.
ACR_6_00847	Did Matthew remember\nanything else?
ACR_6_00848	Yeah, he remembered a little\nabout Kelly and his dad.
ACR_6_00849	But he disappeared once the\nringing started.
ACR_6_00850	Oh dear...
ACR_6_00851	I think he may have gone to the\nold Crusoe Resort offices.
ACR_6_00852	I'm trying to catch up to him, but\nthe gate's closed.
ACR_6_00853	Oh, well you should use the\nshortcut under the bridge.
ACR_6_00854	There's a large pipe under there\nthat isn't used anymore.
ACR_6_00855	The kids used it to get to\nMichael's office all the time.
ACR_6_00856	Thanks, Charlotte.
ACR_6_00860	Huh.
ACR_6_00861	I don't think this was broken the\nlast time I was here...
ACR_6_00864	Does this rope go all the\nway down?
ACR_6_00865	I wonder if Matthew used this\nto get through.
ACR_6_00870	I'll just hang on tight and hope\nfor the best...
ACR_6_00873	Eek!
ACR_6_00877	Owww...
ACR_6_00881	Well that was more dangerous\nthan it needed to be.
ACR_6_00884	...
ACR_6_00886	This is...
ACR_6_00891	This is the building from\nthe photo.
ACR_6_00893	This must be the Crusoe\nResort offices...
ACR_6_00894	Now to try and find Matthew.
ACR_6_00348	The stairway to the second floor is blocked\nby furniture and boxes.
ACR_6_00349	Oh no.
ACR_6_00350	Look at all this junk... I can't\nget past.
ACR_6_00899	Matthew! I've been looking all\nover for you.
ACR_6_00900	Ashley! You found me.
ACR_6_00901	I'm sorry I ran off.
ACR_6_00902	I remembered the way to my\ndad's office.
ACR_6_00903	It came back to me when I heard\nthe bell.
ACR_6_00904	I think we'll be able to find\nsomething here.
ACR_6_00905	It's all right, Matthew. I'll help\nyou look.
ACR_6_00906	Oh, right. Here you go.
ACR_6_00907	My dad's briefcase...
ACR_6_00908	Thanks for grabbing it.
ACR_6_00909	Now let's take a look around.
ACR_6_00362	This poster...
ACR_6_00363	Is this what the resort was going\nto look like?
ACR_6_00364	Yeah, it is.
ACR_6_00365	This was my dad's vision for\nLake Juliet.
ACR_6_00373	There's an old newspaper on the desk.
ACR_6_00374	...
ACR_6_00375	Matthew, check out this photo\nin the paper.
ACR_6_00915	It's sunglasses guy!
ACR_6_00376	Crusoe Development Spurs Protests\nBy Greg Davis\n\nLake Juliet area residents have gathered\nfor a protest demanding Crusoe Resort\ncease further development.\n\nCrusoe Resort, established two years ago\nunder the motto "Harmony between\nNature and People" has been pushing for\nthe resort development. But recently,\nresidents have been voicing complaints,\nclaiming that the water tastes different\nand that there are no longer fish in\nthe lake.\n\nThey blame the resort development and\nstarted protesting to bring it to a halt.\n\nHowever, there has been no definitive\nproof that the development has led to\nany environmental destruction, let alone\nlake pollution.\n\nMeanwhile, Crusoe Resort asserts that an\nunknown contaminant, discovered during\nan independent investigation, is to blame\nfor the pollution.\n\nThis issue is one to keep an eye on.
ACR_6_00379	It says here the pollution may be\nfrom an unknown contaminant.
ACR_6_00380	So that guy's a reporter...
ACR_6_00916	I knew John Smith was a fake\nname! He's really Greg Davis.
ACR_6_00381	Greg Davis...
ACR_6_00367	Hm... I found this.
ACR_6_00368	The key chain is labeled "File Storage."
ACR_6_00369	We can look around a little\nmore with that.
ACR_6_00919	Yeah.
ACR_6_00383	It's open now.
ACR_6_00923	So this is the file room?
ACR_6_00924	I hope we can find some info\nabout my dad in here.
ACR_6_01155	These stickers are kinda cute.
ACR_6_01156	Hm... This is the only locker\nwith a lock.
ACR_6_01157	That's my dad's.
ACR_6_01158	No way, really?
ACR_6_01159	Yeah, I remember...
ACR_6_01160	Kelly put these stickers here.
ACR_6_01161	There's gotta be something\ninside.
ACR_6_01162	But it's locked.
ACR_6_01163	Oh!
ACR_6_01164	What's up?
ACR_6_01165	I thought so. It's a sticker of\nKelly's bunny.
ACR_6_01167	I wonder...
ACR_6_01168	Let me see that.
ACR_6_01169	Sure.
ACR_6_00930	Ah!
ACR_6_00932	A letter?
ACR_6_00934	Let's see what it says.
ACR_6_00936	To my beloved Michael,\n\nI would rather say these things in person,\nbut there's simply not enough time to sit\ndown and discuss this.\n\nThere's so much going on right now, and\nI understand it's a lot to handle... I know\nyou're preoccupied with restoring\nCrusoe Resort's good name, but I'm\nbegging you, please... Turn your focus\ntoward Matthew. He's been through a\nterrible trauma.\n\nHe can't even remember what happened\nthe day Kelly died.\n\nMy days are numbered, I know... That's\nwhy, after I'm gone, I want you two to\nsupport each other. As a family.\n\nAlthough I may not be able to speak these\nwords to you, I hope you'll hear them all\nthe same. This is my only request.\n\n - Emily
ACR_6_00937	Matthew, this is...
ACR_6_00938	It's a letter from my mom.
ACR_6_00939	It's to my dad.
ACR_6_00940	What she wrote...
ACR_6_00941	...
ACR_6_00942	Is it true?
ACR_6_00943	Kelly...
ACR_6_00944	Ugh... Ahhh...
ACR_6_00946	Are you all right?
ACR_6_00948	I remember...
ACR_6_00949	What happened?
ACR_6_00955	The weather was\nso nice that day...
ACR_6_00956	So I told Kelly...
ACR_6_00957	Let's go up the clock tower.
ACR_6_00958	The breeze is great up there...
ACR_6_00959	And the lake looks awesome.
ACR_6_00960	But once we were up there, Kelly\ntried to climb even higher...
ACR_6_00961	I told her to stop. It's dangerous.
ACR_6_00962	But then, the...
ACR_6_00963	The bell...
ACR_6_00964	It started ringing.
ACR_6_00965	And Kelly, she...
ACR_6_00966	The sound scared her...
ACR_6_00967	I was scared to remember Kelly...
ACR_6_00968	and what happened.
ACR_6_00969	That day, Kelly's accident...
ACR_6_00970	I forgot it all.
ACR_6_00971	Matthew, that...
ACR_6_00972	That wasn't your fault.
ACR_6_00973	I need to tell Kelly I'm sorry.
ACR_6_00974	I...I couldn't...
ACR_6_00975	save her...
ACR_6_00982	It wasn't your fault, Matthew.
ACR_6_00983	Kelly? Is it really you?
ACR_6_00984	I ran away. Once you and mom\nwere gone...
ACR_6_00985	I just didn't know what to do.\nI couldn't help Dad.
ACR_6_00986	I'm sorry, Kelly...
ACR_6_00987	I failed as a brother.
ACR_6_00988	Kelly...
ACR_6_00989	I'm glad I got to say I'm sorry.\nI think I'll be OK now.
ACR_6_00488	Thank you.
ACR_6_00495	(Exert Noise)
ACR_6_01180	(Exert Noise)
ACR_6_01184	(Exert Noise)
ACR_6_00996	Come on, Kelly. It's time to go.
ACR_6_00997	Mom?
ACR_6_00998	Matthew...
ACR_6_00999	I'm sorry I can't be\nthere with you.
ACR_6_01185	(Exert Noise)
ACR_6_01181	(Exert Noise)
ACR_6_01000	Kelly...
ACR_6_01001	Mom...
ACR_6_01002	"It's OK..."
ACR_6_01003	"No more tears."
ACR_6_01004	That's what my mom said.
ACR_6_01005	Matthew...
ACR_6_01182	(Exert Noise)
ACR_6_01006	It's OK...
ACR_6_01007	To cry when you're hurting.
ACR_6_01183	(Exert Noise)
ACR_6_01008	...
ACR_6_01011	Are you all right?
ACR_6_01012	Yeah... I'm good.
ACR_6_01013	Hi there!
ACR_6_01014	I guess my warning to stay out\nof it fell on deaf ears, huh?
ACR_6_01015	It's sunglasses guy!
ACR_6_01016	Well done, Matthew.
ACR_6_01017	I take it you still don't\nremember me?
ACR_6_01018	Greg...
ACR_6_01019	What? You know this guy?
ACR_6_01020	Yeah.
ACR_6_01021	Allow me to introduce myself...\nFor real this time.
ACR_6_01022	My name is Greg Davis. I'm a\nreporter.
ACR_6_01023	I was listening in from\nthe hallway.
ACR_6_01024	You helped Matthew regain his\nmemories of Kelly.
ACR_6_01025	Thanks, Ashley.
ACR_6_01026	Did you know all along? That\nhe couldn't remember?
ACR_6_01027	And what happened at the clock\ntower five years ago?
ACR_6_01028	I did... As well as why Matthew\nlost his memory in the first place.
ACR_6_01029	I'm from Lake Juliet.
ACR_6_01030	That's why Michael and I became\nfriends. We go way back.
ACR_6_01031	And I met Matthew about five\nyears ago.
ACR_6_01032	So that's why I didn't\nremember you.
ACR_6_01033	Kelly's death was such a tragedy.
ACR_6_01034	The shock resulted in Matthew's\ndissociative amnesia.
ACR_6_01035	He completely lost his memories\nfrom around that time.
ACR_6_01036	You should have just told me.\nI thought you were a bad guy!
ACR_6_01037	Had I told you, you would have\nremembered all the pain too.
ACR_6_01038	I wanted to spare you that.
ACR_6_01039	So you had me pass your warning\non to Matthew. Instead of telling\nhim yourself.
ACR_6_01040	I never believed you were a\nsecret agent, by the way.
ACR_6_01041	You wrote the article about the\npollution, right?
ACR_6_01042	I did. But I never meant for\nCrusoe Resort to take the blame.
ACR_6_01043	I only wanted to shine a light on\na problem in my hometown.
ACR_6_01044	But in the end, that article...
ACR_6_01045	It pushed my friend's company\nto ruin.
ACR_6_01046	But now I'm close to learning the\ntrue cause of the pollution.
ACR_6_01047	All I need is Michael's notes.
ACR_6_01048	My dad's notes?
ACR_6_01049	He left them in his locker, right?
ACR_6_01050	There are some documents in the box on the\nlower shelf.
ACR_6_01051	What's this?
ACR_6_01052	The Problem of Pollution in Lake Juliet\nand Its Connection to J.C. Valley\n\nThe Crusoe Resort project was intended\nto make the most of Lake Juliet's natural\nbeauty. We never approved or plotted\nany manner of environmental\ndestruction.\n\nHowever, Crusoe Resort is now being\nblamed for the pollution of the lake's\nwater. Our business is bankrupt as\na result.\n\nUnwilling to accept this outcome, I joined\nefforts with the few remaining staff\nmembers, and as a result of our\nindependent investigations, we can\nconfidently state that the source of the\nwater pollution is J.C. Valley.\n\nThis document details our investigation\nof Lake Juliet in an attempt to bring the\ntruth to light.\n\n - Michael Crusoe
ACR_6_01053	Whoa... It says that J.C. Valley is\nresponsible for the pollution.
ACR_6_01054	Those are Michael's notes...\nI finally have them.
ACR_6_01055	Does it have any information\nabout my dad?
ACR_6_01056	It does.
ACR_6_01057	If I can reach out to my <color=#00994CFF>J.C.\nValley informant</color>...
ACR_6_01058	maybe I can finally learn the\ntruth about the pollution.
ACR_6_01059	I'm so close to fulfilling my\n<color=#00994CFF>promise to Michael</color>.
ACR_6_01060	Your J.C. Valley informant...\nDo you mean Ian?
ACR_6_01061	You talked to him on the phone\nearlier, right?
ACR_6_01062	Ah crap, you heard that?
ACR_6_01063	I was trying to snag an inside\nsource and wound up with him.
ACR_6_01064	He should be coming through\nwith some key intel soon.
ACR_6_01065	Listen, this info on Ian is strictly\nconfidential. Got it?
ACR_6_01066	If Dr. Robins were to find out...
ACR_6_01067	Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.\nNot even my dad.
ACR_6_01068	I appreciate that.
ACR_6_01069	What did you promise\nMatthew's dad?
ACR_6_01070	Michael and I made a promise to\neach other five years ago.
ACR_6_01071	I told him I'd discover the source\nof the pollution...
ACR_6_01072	he told me he'd reestablish\nhis company.
ACR_6_01073	Your father didn't want to face\nyou until he had earned back\nwhat he had lost.
ACR_6_01074	I mean, clearly... To have left you\nafter you'd already lost so much.
ACR_6_01075	But now, Michael is...
ACR_6_01076	He's what? Where's my dad?\nTell me, please!
ACR_6_01077	Just tell him, Greg. Matthew\ndeserves to know.
ACR_6_01078	Michael is in the hospital.
ACR_6_01079	He worked tirelessly, saving up\nmoney to reunite with you...
ACR_6_01080	But there was an accident at his\nwork site. He's in a coma.
ACR_6_01081	No, it can't be true...
ACR_6_01082	Speaking.
ACR_6_01083	Really...
ACR_6_01084	Understood.
ACR_6_01085	I'll head out right away.
ACR_6_01086	So, Matthew... Do you believe\nin miracles?
ACR_6_01087	It would seem your father has\nwoken up.
ACR_6_01088	That's great, Matthew. Your mom\nand Kelly must have been looking\nout for him.
ACR_6_01089	Yeah...
ACR_6_01090	I wanna go to the hospital.\nRight now!
ACR_6_01091	Of course. I'll take you.
ACR_6_01092	Look out for Matthew, Greg.
ACR_6_01093	I'll keep him safe.
ACR_6_01094	Thank you, Ashley. I owe you\nso much.
ACR_6_01095	You don't have to thank me.
ACR_6_01096	I know just how you feel.
ACR_6_01097	Mhm.
ACR_6_00681	See you later?
ACR_6_00682	Oh, wait! Take this.
ACR_6_00683	My watch!
ACR_6_00684	I picked it up off the ground.
ACR_6_00685	My dad gave it to me... I thought\nI'd lost it.
ACR_6_00686	Yeah. I know.
ACR_6_00687	I saw what it says on the back.
ACR_6_00688	"To my dear son, Matthew."
ACR_6_00689	You should go!
ACR_6_00690	You have a lot of catching\nup to do.
ACR_6_00691	All right!
ACR_6_00712	Good luck, Matthew.
ACR_6_01098	Ashley.
ACR_6_01099	Ryan?
ACR_6_01100	Dr. Robins asked me to find you.
ACR_6_01101	Really? Why?
ACR_6_01102	He became worried when you\ndidn't answer the phone in\nhis cottage.
ACR_6_01103	Oh... Right.
ACR_6_01104	There's something he wishes to\ntalk to you about.
ACR_6_01105	Dr. Robins is in the lab. You\nshould go see him.
ACR_6_01106	I've got a few things I want to\nask him too.
ACR_6_01107	Thanks.
ACR_6_01108	Well then, shall we go?
ACR_6_01186	(Exert Noise)
ACR_6_01109	So this is J.C. Valley?
ACR_6_01110	Where'd he go?
ACR_6_01111	Oh well. Guess I'll head in.
ACR_6_01112	I was here with Mom...
ACR_6_01113	She brought me to J.C. Valley.\nShe kept it a secret from Dad.
ACR_6_01114	What were you doing all those\nyears ago, Mom?
ACR_6_00729	I've been waiting for you, Ashley.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00040	All these technical books are way\nover my head. I should probably\njust leave them alone.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00001	What's this book?
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00002	It's the clock smith's diary.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00041	Doesn't look like this will be\ntoo helpful.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00003	A diary! It might have info about\nthis device.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00005	There's a certain mechanism in the\nmachine that moves the clocks.\n\nFirst, insert the three keys into their\nproper spots. These keys have been\npassed down through our family.\n\nThen, turn the three keys to the\nproper time.\n\nRefer to the note on the right page while\ntaking a close look at the machine room.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00009	I see... So this is how I can move\nthe clocks.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00014	Looks like steps on how to move\nthe clocks.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00042	There's nothing about the device\nwritten here.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00043	There's a stack of books.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00044	It's all junk. Doesn't look like\nanything useful.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00045	There's a cardboard box under the desk.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00046	I can't even begin to read this.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00047	There are stacks of documents and blueprints.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00048	Doesn't look like there's any\ninfo about the device.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00049	There's a stack of blueprints.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00050	They look pretty technical. But\nnot about the clock tower.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00051	There are books on top of the desk.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00052	Nothing all that interesting\nlooking.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00053	There's a cabinet on the desk.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00054	So dusty...
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00055	There are stacks of dust-covered documents.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00056	I guess they're for maintenance\nor something.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00057	Several tools are hung up.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00058	The letters are too thin.\nI can't read it.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00059	There's an old paper.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00060	The letters are too thin.\nI can't read it.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00061	There's an old paper.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00019	There's something here.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00020	I've gotta check inside the\nclock tower right now.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00021	I should figure out a way to\nmove the clocks first.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00016	This device can move the clocks.\nIf I could get it to work, that is...
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00017	How can I do that?
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00083	I wonder how I can get the\ndevice to move...
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00084	We've gotta figure it out to\nring the bell.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00085	The machine is still not working.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00023	There's a device for moving the clocks.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00024	There are three keyholes. Maybe\nthe keys fit here.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00025	Hm, this one won't work.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00026	All right, that one fit!
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00027	Not this one...
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00028	I think the diary said, "Insert\nthe three keys into their\nproper spots."
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00029	Three keyholes... Which key goes\ninto which one?
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00030	Maybe I can find a hint.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00031	OK, all three keys are in.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00086	Nothing's happening.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00033	The steps listed in the diary from\nearlier must be how to get this\nworking.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00034	So what should I do...
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00035	Maybe I can find a hint.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00062	What's this part sticking out?
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00063	It's set to nine o'clock. Is that\nimportant?
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00064	The design of the stone wall is different at\nthe nine o'clock position.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00065	This looks different.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00066	Oh, of course! I'm seeing it from\nbehind. The dial is reversed.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00067	The numbers look reversed.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00068	I wonder if this black thing is\na clock hand...
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00069	A clock hand can be seen.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00070	It's sticking out here.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00071	This one looks set to eleven\no'clock.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00072	The design of the stone wall is different at\nthe eleven o'clock position.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00073	Only this part is sticking out.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00074	It's set to seven o'clock. Is this\njust how it was built?
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00075	The design of the stone wall is different at\nthe seven o'clock position.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00076	Only this part is sticking out.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00077	Looks like it's set to two o'clock.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00078	The design of the stone wall is different at\nthe two o'clock position.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00079	It appears this desk was used as a workbench.
ACR_Mystery_6_1_00080	Ugh. If only I had some hint for\nhow to move the device.
ACR_Mystery_6_2_00020	I should look around here\na little more.
ACR_Mystery_6_2_00024	This pipe's huge.
ACR_Mystery_6_2_00025	I can see some light way\ndown there...
ACR_Mystery_6_2_00026	Maybe I can go through here.
ACR_Mystery_6_2_00027	Well... Let's go.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00001	I should look for clues about\nMatthew's dad.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00006	Matthew, can I see that\nstuffed animal?
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00007	Sure.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00010	It won't open if we don't know\nthe right numbers.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00011	Maybe there's a hint somewhere.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00013	I wonder if there's some sort of\nhint on the locker door...
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00106	I guess this is the wrong number.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00023	There's nothing inside.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00034	This is a sticker of Kelly's\nstuffed rabbit.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00043	It's the same rabbit as the\nstuffed animal.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00108	There's a sticker of a rabbit.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00109	Let's see if it'll open.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00046	There's a sticker of a rabbit facing away.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00116	The locker is locked with a combination lock.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00071	Is this a sticker of a squirrel?
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00072	There's a sticker of a squirrel.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00110	Nothing really stands out...
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00111	No clues to the combination\nanywhere?
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00117	Maybe there are spots\nother than the tag that\nare worth checking.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00073	The design is cute, but also...\nReally super creepy.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00075	Kelly was into these spooky\nsorts of things?
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00089	Oops, I almost broke it... I guess\nthe zipper's just for decoration.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00090	The zipper doesn't unzip. I should\nlook somewhere else.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00112	Oh, this tag says "Pinky Rabbit."
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00113	Is this from some new Pinky\nRabbit series?
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00114	There's something written here.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00118	Numbers... Hmm.
ACR_Mystery_6_5_00115	These numbers must\nmean something.
ACR_7_Scenario_00218	Information on liquid memory is displayed\non the console.
ACR_7_Scenario_00013	Remaining liquid memory: 18.4%
ACR_7_Scenario_00014	The percent remaining is dropping steadily.\nThe situation requires immediate action.
ACR_7_Scenario_00015	The amount of liquid memory\nkeeps dropping? But why?
ACR_7_Scenario_00219	Remaining liquid memory: 18.4%
ACR_7_Scenario_00220	Approaching critical levels.\nRecommend immediate action.
ACR_7_Scenario_00221	Incongruent data detected.\nError in chronological arrays.
ACR_7_Scenario_00222	Deviations found in the following\nlocation paths...
ACR_7_Scenario_00223	Huh. I guess this means\nsomething unusual is happening.
ACR_7_Scenario_00224	Hmm...
ACR_7_Scenario_00225	I don't understand what any\nof this actually means.
ACR_7_Scenario_00226	Incongruent data detected.\nError in chronological arrays.
ACR_7_Scenario_00227	Deviations found in the following\nlocation paths...
ACR_7_Scenario_00229	I'm three floors below\nground level.
ACR_7_Scenario_00230	Sofia said that Dad's lab was\non the second floor of the\nbasement.
ACR_7_Scenario_00231	Still in the lake... Where are\nyou, Dad?
ACR_7_Scenario_00232	Things have really gone\nsideways here...
ACR_7_Scenario_00233	Hey, that's Elizabeth's...
ACR_7_Scenario_00021	J.C. Valley Founder\nJudd Fitzgerald
ACR_7_Scenario_00022	1980 - 2002
ACR_7_Scenario_00023	That's who Mom was talking\nto 13 years ago.
ACR_7_Scenario_00024	A large portrait of Rex hangs on the wall,\nwith a plaque engraved with his name.
ACR_7_Scenario_00025	J.C. Valley Director\nRex Alfred
ACR_7_Scenario_00234	Developments in Liquid Memory\n\nLiquid memory, developed under Judd\nFitzgerald's directorship, was a huge\nstep forward in the development of the\nANOTHER project. However, the liquid's\npotential to do significant damage to\nthe environment must be improved upon.\nThis was made abundantly clear six\nyears ago, after the liquid memory\nspilled into Lake Juliet.\n\nBecause of these revelations, a new\nteam was formed with Dr. Richard\nRobins at the helm, and development\nbegan on a new version of liquid\nmemory. The goal of the new project\nwas to make liquid memory a safer and\nmore efficient medium for the storage\nof memory, thereby improving research\nin the field.\n\nRex Alfred
ACR_7_Scenario_00030	There are some papers on the desk.\nThe cover page says the following:
ACR_7_Scenario_00031	On the Development of a New Form of\nLiquid Memory
ACR_7_Scenario_00032	Re-read the note?
ACR_7_Scenario_00033	So they were still producing\nliquid memory even after\nthe spill?
ACR_7_Scenario_00034	And Dad was doing research on\na new kind of liquid memory...
ACR_7_Scenario_00035	Hm. I think I got everything out\nof this that it has to offer.
ACR_7_Scenario_00036	The J.C. Valley research facility was\nfounded by Judd Fitzgerald, a leading\nfigure in the field of memory research,\nalong with a collection of researchers\nfrom across the country.\n\nFitzgerald, along with one of his fellow\nresearchers, Sayoko Kitazato, created\nan innovative theory within the realm\nof memory control. Putting the theory\ninto practice, Fitzgerald then developed\nthe ANOTHER device.\n\nAlthough this device was never completed,\nit laid the foundation for the ANOTHER\ntheory, which was subsequently refined\nby Sayoko.
ACR_7_Scenario_00037	There's a book titled "History of J.C. Valley."
ACR_7_Scenario_00038	Re-read the text?
ACR_7_Scenario_00039	Mom was working on ANOTHER\nalongside Judd.
ACR_7_Scenario_00040	Hm. I think I read all the\nimportant stuff already.
ACR_7_Scenario_00041	I should wait here like Gina said.
ACR_7_Scenario_00043	Ah!
ACR_7_Scenario_00044	Could that be Gina calling?
ACR_7_Scenario_00045	I should answer. It could be Gina.
ACR_7_Scenario_00235	Gina's taking too long... I hope\nnothing happened.
ACR_7_Scenario_00236	Maybe I should take a peek\noutside, just to see...
ACR_7_Scenario_00048	Dr. Robins invited his daughter out,\nso I had a boy steal her bag for me.\nUnfortunately, she wasn't carrying\nany information on the ANOTHER\nwith her.\n\nI'm not giving up though. Based on what\nI've been told by my local informant, it's\npossible Ashley knows something about\nthe ANOTHER device. I'm going to make\ndirect contact with her to confirm.
ACR_7_Scenario_00049	Sofia's computer is on the desk.
ACR_7_Scenario_00050	There are two sent emails on screen that\neach have interesting subject lines.
ACR_7_Scenario_00237	Re-read the emails?
ACR_7_Scenario_00053	We still don't know where Sofia\ngot her information.
ACR_7_Scenario_00054	It's risky to stay here long. Let's\nhurry and meet up with Ian.
ACR_7_Scenario_00055	Then we can go try to find help,\nlike you said.
ACR_7_Scenario_00059	Compared to the first iteration of the\nANOTHER device developed at\nJ.C. Valley, the one developed on\nBlood Edward Island boasted superior\nfunctionality based on data from early\ntesting. But unfortunately, the updated\nmodel was destroyed.\n\nHowever, some data was extracted before\nits destruction, and that data was loaded\nonto the prototype ANOTHER.\n\nThe data transfer introduced a new\nproblem. The data was configured with\na unique initialization code, so an\nexternal system was required to access\nit. It seems Dr. Robins added an extra\nencryption layer during the creation of\nthe new device.\n\nThe agent assigned to Blood Edward\nIsland reported the existence of a\nstandalone remote access point for\nthe destroyed ANOTHER. We have been\nso far unable to confirm those reports.\nDr. Robins is staying quiet, but it is\nhighly likely his daughter, Ashley, is in\npossession of the remote device.\n\nAshley's personal belongings will be the\nnext target of our ongoing inquiry.
ACR_7_Scenario_00063	Dad can play guitar too? Maybe\nI should ask him to jam with me.
ACR_7_Scenario_00064	Dad's coworkers are in this\nphoto. It looks like he's friends\nwith pretty much everyone.
ACR_7_Scenario_00282	Photos and notes are on a corkboard in front\nthe desk.
ACR_7_Scenario_00068	Dad has some pictures of us\nhere too.
ACR_7_Scenario_00069	Where the heck did this photo\ncome from?
ACR_7_Scenario_00283	Photos of Sayoko, Ashley, and\nJessica decorate the desk.
ACR_7_Scenario_00071	A well-used coffee maker sits on the counter.
ACR_7_Scenario_00072	The faint scent of coffee lingers in the room.
ACR_7_Scenario_00073	Dad and his coffee...
ACR_7_Scenario_00238	I've gotta keep moving.
ACR_7_Scenario_00239	I've gotta keep moving.
ACR_7_Scenario_00240	I've gotta keep moving.
ACR_7_Scenario_00278	Over here, Ashley.
ACR_7_Scenario_00074	There's a building directory for J.C. Valley.
ACR_7_Scenario_00075	There's a pamphlet that includes the info from\nthe building directory.
ACR_7_Scenario_00076	This'll help me figure out where\nI am... I should take one with me.
ACR_7_Scenario_00078	There's a building directory for J.C. Valley.
ACR_7_Scenario_00079	There's a pamphlet that includes the info from\nthe building directory.
ACR_7_Scenario_00080	Hm... I guess one pamphlet is\nprobably enough.
ACR_7_Scenario_00241	Ian's room is on B1. Let's hurry.
ACR_7_Scenario_00242	I've gotta keep moving.
ACR_7_Scenario_00081	The elevator's emergency stop has\nbeen activated.
ACR_7_Scenario_00082	The gate is locked.
ACR_7_Scenario_00084	OK. Now to room number 103.
ACR_7_Scenario_00243	All right. Shall we?
ACR_7_Scenario_00085	Be careful, Ashley.
ACR_7_Scenario_00244	Hey, over here.
ACR_7_Scenario_00245	Security should be this way.
ACR_7_Scenario_00246	I see it! It's over that way.
ACR_7_Scenario_00247	All right. I need to get inside...
ACR_7_Scenario_00248	The security scanner for the door has\nbeen powered down.
ACR_7_Scenario_00090	I've gotta save Dad.
ACR_7_Scenario_00091	I need to get to B3.
ACR_7_Scenario_00092	There's an elevator to the surface.
ACR_7_Scenario_00093	Doesn't seem like I'll be able to\nmake it to B3 from here.
ACR_7_Scenario_00095	Sofia should be in here.
ACR_7_Scenario_00096	This could be dangerous. I should\nkeep my distance.
ACR_7_Scenario_00251	I've gotta get to Dad's office.
ACR_7_Scenario_00097	The computer is unlocked.
ACR_7_Scenario_00098	The username is j.c.valley_0013.
ACR_7_Scenario_00266	There's a box of chocolate bars in the drawer.
ACR_7_Scenario_00267	There are...quite a few bars in there.
ACR_7_Scenario_00268	Ugh, Dad... Have you been\nusing chocolate as a meal\nreplacement again?
ACR_7_Scenario_00269	No... I, uh...
ACR_7_Scenario_00270	Didn't Jessica tell you eating too\nmuch of this junk is bad for you?
ACR_7_Scenario_00271	Sugar helps the brain recover\nand refuel after hard work!
ACR_7_Scenario_00272	Plus, chocolate has other brain\nbenefits—studies have proven!
ACR_7_Scenario_00273	No excuses!
ACR_7_Scenario_00274	...All right, all right.
ACR_7_Scenario_00107	There's a box of chocolate bars in the drawer.
ACR_7_Scenario_00108	There are...quite a few bars in there.
ACR_7_Scenario_00109	Nice. I like this kind too...
ACR_7_Scenario_00110	Can't hurt to have one, right?
ACR_7_Scenario_00112	There's a box of chocolate bars in the drawer.
ACR_7_Scenario_00113	There are...quite a few bars in there.
ACR_7_Scenario_00117	I can't just leave Dad...
ACR_7_Scenario_00118	There's an elevator to the surface.
ACR_7_Scenario_00121	I need to get to the security\noffice with Dad.
ACR_7_Scenario_00279	After all that effort to lock her\nup... Where'd she go?
ACR_7_Scenario_00280	We're counting on you, Ashley.
ACR_7_Scenario_00281	Be careful out there.
ACR_7_Scenario_00284	Sofia might find us if we\ngo back.
ACR_7_00004	Oh, hey. We met at the campsite,\ndidn't we?
ACR_7_00007	You remember me!
ACR_7_00008	Hello again. I'm Sofia Callaghan.
ACR_7_00022	I'll take you to Dr. Robins.
ACR_7_00023	He's down in the lab in\nSub-Basement Two.
ACR_7_01341	The lab's underground?
ACR_7_01342	Indeed it is. Go ahead onto\nthe elevator.
ACR_7_00027	So, um...
ACR_7_00030	Yes?
ACR_7_00031	Did the trouble with the security\nsystem get sorted out?
ACR_7_00034	Yes. Dr. Robins fixed it.\n
ACR_7_00035	He is quite brilliant.
ACR_7_00036	Quite...
ACR_7_00038	He always acts so weird\naround me...
ACR_7_00039	But people here have so much\nrespect for him.
ACR_7_00042	Gah!
ACR_7_00046	Sorry, Ashley... I'd rather avoid\nbeing so brutish.
ACR_7_00047	But there's someone who'd like\nto meet you.
ACR_7_01343	Dr. Robins, it's an emergency!
ACR_7_01344	Security on the underground\nstorage has been deactivated!
ACR_7_01345	What?!
ACR_7_01346	Sofia's ID is in the logs.
ACR_7_01347	So it was her all along? What\ncould she be after?
ACR_7_01348	Gina, call Rex.
ACR_7_01349	I'll check with Ian to make sure\neverything is OK.
ACR_7_00050	Ugh... Hmm...
ACR_7_00053	Ummh...
ACR_7_00054	Was I asleep?
ACR_7_00057	She knocked me out!
ACR_7_00059	Ugh...
ACR_7_00061	Urgh...
ACR_7_00063	Why did she do that?
ACR_7_00065	And where am I? Is this the lab?
ACR_7_00068	Oh...
ACR_7_00082	I've been here...
ACR_7_00083	Mom looked worried... She was\ntalking with a man in a lab coat...
ACR_7_00084	What do they do here?
ACR_7_00086	Dad...
ACR_7_00087	Huh? What's that?
ACR_7_00088	There's something on\nthe monitor...
ACR_7_01350	The door is locked.
ACR_7_01351	It's not opening. Hang on...\nAm I...
ACR_7_01352	Am I locked in here?!
ACR_7_01353	"Regarding the Stored Liquid\nMemory"?
ACR_7_01354	What the heck is liquid memory?
ACR_7_01355	"Regarding the Stored Liquid Memory"\n- Liquid memory is a liquefied form of\n   storage that allows complex\n   information to be backed up in a\n   minuscule volume.\n- Liquid memory excels at changing\n   shape, has a high resistance to impact\n   and vibration, and does not degrade\n   over time. Therefore, the information\n   can be stored indefinitely.\n- However, information written to liquid\n   memory is fixed, and is therefore\n   difficult to transfer to another form\n   of storage.\n\nAddendum\n- Water from Lake Juliet is used for its\n   peculiar composition, which is required\n   for the creation of liquid memory.\n- As such, the creation of a large volume\n   of liquid memory is currently believed\n   to be impossible, as it would result in\n   the lake drying up completely.
ACR_7_01356	It's kind of dense, but if I'm\nreading this correctly...
ACR_7_01357	This liquid memory is made from\nthe water in Lake Juliet.
ACR_7_01358	So if I have this right...
ACR_7_01359	The pollution in Lake Juliet is\nactually liquid memory?
ACR_7_01828	The RAS is responding!\nWhich means...
ACR_7_01829	I knew it. The DAS is\nresponding too.
ACR_7_01830	It's the same as the security\ndevice at Lake Juliet.
ACR_7_01831	I'll try using the DAS.
ACR_7_00100	It opened!
ACR_7_00102	Am I gonna have to sneak past,\nlike, guards or something?
ACR_7_00104	Guess I'm clear...
ACR_7_01863	(Exert Noise)
ACR_7_01864	(Exert Noise)
ACR_7_00110	The bottom of the lake...
ACR_7_00111	The water looks so different here.
ACR_7_00115	Huh.
ACR_7_00117	My mom's pendant...
ACR_7_00118	There's water glowing inside it.
ACR_7_00120	Mom...
ACR_7_00121	Help keep me safe, all right?\nLead me to Dad.
ACR_7_00138	Looks clear.
ACR_7_00157	Someone's coming!
ACR_7_00160	Hm! Hm hm mmf!
ACR_7_00162	*grunt*
ACR_7_00165	*grunt*
ACR_7_00167	Ugh!
ACR_7_00169	Oof!
ACR_7_00174	Ah!
ACR_7_00176	Aren't you...
ACR_7_00178	Gina...
ACR_7_00180	What's going on?! What are you\nplanning on doing with me?!
ACR_7_00182	You're right, you're right... I was\ntoo rough. Sorry.
ACR_7_00185	You're working with Sofia,\naren't you?!
ACR_7_00199	I understand why you're\nsuspicious.
ACR_7_00200	But I'm going to need you to\ntrust me. OK?
ACR_7_01360	What are you doing here?
ACR_7_01361	My dad asked me to come.
ACR_7_01362	Dr. Robins called for you?\nFirst I'm hearing of this...
ACR_7_01363	Ryan came and told me.
ACR_7_01364	Ryan? Ryan who?
ACR_7_01365	What do you mean Ryan who?\nThe Ryan that works here?
ACR_7_01368	Either way, this person told you\nto come here?
ACR_7_01369	That's really strange... I need to\nlook into this.
ACR_7_01370	It's dangerous. You need to\nstay put.
ACR_7_01371	What's my dad doing?
ACR_7_01372	He's working with Ian, our\nsystem admin.
ACR_7_01373	They're trying to keep Sofia\nout of our data.
ACR_7_01374	Tell me what's going on.
ACR_7_01375	Some bad stuff is going down\nright now...
ACR_7_01376	Sofia is trying to steal data\nfrom the lab.
ACR_7_01377	What?
ACR_7_01378	Come here.
ACR_7_00288	What is this?
ACR_7_00289	It's a direct-call system that\nconnects all the rooms in the lab.
ACR_7_00290	If it's still working, then...
ACR_7_00299	Ugh...
ACR_7_00302	Ian! Are you all right?
ACR_7_00306	Wait here.
ACR_7_00308	I'm going to Ian's office.
ACR_7_00313	Stay here where it's safer.
ACR_7_00323	J.C. Valley Founder\nJudd Fitzgerald
ACR_7_00324	1980 - 2002
ACR_7_00325	So this is the guy who started\nthis place...
ACR_7_01379	The ANOTHER is still in active\ndevelopment. Using it now\nis dangerous.
ACR_7_01380	The experiment is what will allow\nus to complete its development!
ACR_7_00326	Judd, the founder of J.C. Valley.\nThat's who Mom was talking to.
ACR_7_00331	There's a portrait of Rex on the wall.\nHis name is on a plate below it.
ACR_7_00332	J.C. Valley Director\nRex Alfred
ACR_7_00333	Fancy picture...
ACR_7_00334	This must be Elizabeth's\ndad's office.
ACR_7_00336	Some papers sit on the desk. The cover\npage reads:
ACR_7_00337	On the Development of a New\nForm of Liquid Memory
ACR_7_00338	What's this?
ACR_7_00341	This tank accident... It must be\nthe source of the pollution\nGreg's been looking for.
ACR_7_00347	There's a red book with an elegant design.
ACR_7_00348	History of J.C. Valley
ACR_7_00349	A book about this lab?
ACR_7_00351	Mom was researching ANOTHER\nhere, along with Judd.
ACR_7_00355	Rex, is that you?
ACR_7_00357	Ryan!
ACR_7_00358	Ashley? What are you\ndoing there?
ACR_7_00359	Sofia was showing me around,\nbut she attacked me.
ACR_7_00360	She attacked Ian too. But Gina\nfound me.
ACR_7_01381	Ryan, what the heck is going on\naround here?!
ACR_7_00361	That's terrible, Ashley. I'm sorry.
ACR_7_01382	Do you know what's going on?
ACR_7_01383	Yes, I do.
ACR_7_00362	I believe Sofia intends to acquire\nthe ANOTHER's source code.
ACR_7_00363	The ANOTHER...
ACR_7_00364	Dad isn't trying to rebuild it,\nis he?
ACR_7_00365	Sofia may be working with\nsomeone else...
ACR_7_00366	Please be careful.
ACR_7_00368	I'll look into what she's\nbeen doing.
ACR_7_00369	You and I should meet up later.
ACR_7_00402	Gina!
ACR_7_00404	Ashley? I told you to stay put.
ACR_7_01384	The gate won't open?
ACR_7_01385	Nope.
ACR_7_01386	Scanning this should open it...
ACR_7_01387	But it just isn't working. I've\ntried everything.
ACR_7_01388	This must be Sofia's doing...
ACR_7_01389	Let me try.
ACR_7_01390	Huh?
ACR_7_00429	All right, got it.
ACR_7_00430	What is that? What did you\njust use?
ACR_7_00432	This is the RAS. It can open all\nsorts of gates, doors, whatever.
ACR_7_00433	OK, but what is it?
ACR_7_00434	It's this thing my mom invented.
ACR_7_00435	Your mom made a piece of tech\nlike that, and you have it?
ACR_7_00438	Well, in any case, good job.\nNow I can get to Ian.
ACR_7_01391	Where is he?
ACR_7_01392	Lab 103.
ACR_7_01393	I don't want to stand around\nwaiting. I want to come with you.
ACR_7_01394	Ashley...
ACR_7_01395	I have the RAS. It's bound to\ncome in handy again.
ACR_7_01396	Right... OK, let's go.
ACR_7_00458	My bag!
ACR_7_00459	What?
ACR_7_01397	This is my bag. It was stolen at\nthe bus stop.
ACR_7_01398	What's it doing here?
ACR_7_00461	Sofia must have left it here.
ACR_7_00462	She was the one who asked\nMatthew to steal it.
ACR_7_01399	Why would Sofia want your bag?
ACR_7_00464	Ugh! She dumped all my stuff\nin the garbage?!
ACR_7_00465	I need to make sure it's all here.
ACR_7_00472	You're going to search\nthe computer?
ACR_7_00473	Yeah. Might be able to dig up\nsome dirt on Sofia.
ACR_7_00474	Do you know her password?
ACR_7_00475	Probably...
ACR_7_00477	Got it!
ACR_7_00478	Whoa, already? You're amazing!
ACR_7_00479	I do my best. One point for the\ngood guys, right?
ACR_7_00480	Right!
ACR_7_00481	Oh... Oh. This is...
ACR_7_00483	You found something?
ACR_7_00484	She was emailing someone...
ACR_7_00485	I can't see who. But there are\ntwo emails here.
ACR_7_00486	Sofia may have had help.
ACR_7_00487	What do they say?
ACR_7_00489	What is this?
ACR_7_00490	It's information about the\nANOTHER. She's getting\nhelp from somewhere.
ACR_7_00491	Sofia was after me right from\nthe start.
ACR_7_00492	She had Matthew steal my bag\nin exchange for info on his dad.
ACR_7_00493	Sofia, you...
ACR_7_00495	I'm not letting her get away\nwith this!
ACR_7_00497	Gina?
ACR_7_00498	I've had enough of her doing\nwhatever she pleases.
ACR_7_00499	Let's stop her!
ACR_7_00500	First we need to find whoever's\nhelping her.
ACR_7_00501	Let's see what's in the\nother email.
ACR_7_00505	There's an ANOTHER in this lab?
ACR_7_00506	This mentions an agent... I\nwonder if that was Bill.
ACR_7_00507	And I wonder if Dad knows Sofia\nwas looking into ANOTHER.
ACR_7_00508	Dad's not on the ANOTHER project\nanymore, is he?
ACR_7_00509	Blood Edward Island? Dr. Robins\nmentioned that place.
ACR_7_00510	Maybe this "agent" is the person\nhelping Sofia.
ACR_7_00511	No. It can't be. He died on\nthe island.
ACR_7_00512	You were there with your dad...
ACR_7_00513	Well, if he's gone, who's Sofia\nworking with now?
ACR_7_00523	So this is my dad's lab?
ACR_7_00524	That's right.
ACR_7_00525	I could have guessed from\nthe mess.
ACR_7_00526	Your dad's very passionate about\nhis work, often to the point he'd\nspend the night here...
ACR_7_00528	This one's closed too.
ACR_7_00529	Can you open it?
ACR_7_00530	Leave it to me.
ACR_7_00533	Got it!
ACR_7_00534	I've only heard stories about\nyour mother.
ACR_7_00535	But what I heard is that she was\nthe real deal. A true genius.
ACR_7_00536	Can you tell me anything\nabout her?
ACR_7_00537	I know she was a founding\nmember of J.C. Valley.
ACR_7_00538	She was a legend. Handpicked\nby Judd himself. But I never had\nthe pleasure of meeting her.
ACR_7_00539	Oh...
ACR_7_00547	Wait!
ACR_7_00550	Ashley! Get in the elevator!
ACR_7_00551	OK!
ACR_7_00556	You're not getting away!
ACR_7_00561	Ugh!
ACR_7_01402	Gina!
ACR_7_00563	I'm fine, close the door!
ACR_7_00570	...
ACR_7_00573	Gina?! Are you OK?
ACR_7_00574	Yeah... Just a graze. I got lucky.
ACR_7_00579	She's coming after us.
ACR_7_00580	She has a gun! What do we do?
ACR_7_00584	I pressed the emergency\nstop button.
ACR_7_00585	That'll stop the elevator.\nFor now.
ACR_7_00586	This is the only elevator up.
ACR_7_00587	Let's see how she likes being\nstuck down there.
ACR_7_00588	Good thinking!
ACR_7_00590	Let's go. Ian's lab is 103.
ACR_7_00591	OK! Let's go.
ACR_7_00595	The gate's closed.
ACR_7_00596	We can't go that way right now.
ACR_7_00598	Let's hurry to 103.
ACR_7_00599	Sounds good.
ACR_7_00603	Ian!
ACR_7_00606	Ian!
ACR_7_00607	Wake up!
ACR_7_00609	Ugh...
ACR_7_00610	Are you OK?
ACR_7_00612	Gina?
ACR_7_00615	I was on a call when my\ndoor opened.
ACR_7_00616	It was Sofia.
ACR_7_00617	She knocked me out. Some\nchemical...
ACR_7_00619	And then we found you.
ACR_7_00624	Wow...
ACR_7_00625	Gina, you and Dr. Robins were\nright about the leak.
ACR_7_00626	I still can't believe it was Sofia.
ACR_7_01403	And to think she'd attack Ashley!
ACR_7_00627	Did Dr. Robins come\nthrough here?
ACR_7_00628	No, I haven't seen him.
ACR_7_00629	That's funny. He told us he was\ncoming to see you.
ACR_7_00630	Maybe he stopped by security to\ncheck things out...
ACR_7_00631	I hope he didn't run into Sofia.
ACR_7_01405	Sofia's armed. She shot at us.
ACR_7_01406	Are you OK?
ACR_7_01407	I'm fine, don't worry... I'm more\nworried about Dr. Robins.
ACR_7_01408	I'm going to look for my dad.
ACR_7_01409	What?
ACR_7_01410	I'm worried about him. I'll head to\nthe security office.
ACR_7_00633	I'll go with you. Gina, you rest\nup here, OK?
ACR_7_00634	OK... Take care of Ashley, Ian.
ACR_7_01411	The security office is on\nthis floor.
ACR_7_00680	It won't open. The security\nsystem must be acting up.
ACR_7_01412	The gate in sub-basement two\nwas the same. It's Sofia's fault.
ACR_7_00684	Give me just a sec, OK?
ACR_7_01413	Time to crack this puppy open.
ACR_7_00685	Can you fix it?
ACR_7_01414	Hmm, that's right...
ACR_7_01415	Ian was Greg's informant.
ACR_7_00693	Hey, Ian?
ACR_7_00694	What is it?
ACR_7_00695	Do you know what caused the\nwater pollution?
ACR_7_00698	Why would you ask me that?
ACR_7_00699	I know what caused it.
ACR_7_00700	You've been talking to someone\nnamed Greg Davis, right?
ACR_7_01416	What?
ACR_7_00704	Come on, Ian. Tell me.
ACR_7_00705	Why did you talk to him?
ACR_7_00706	The pollution is J.C. Valley's\nfault, isn't it?
ACR_7_00711	You really are your father's\ndaughter. Can't resist a mystery.
ACR_7_01417	Greg was just as much my\ninformant as I was his.
ACR_7_01418	What? What does that mean?
ACR_7_01419	We're helping each other. We\neach have our own reasons.
ACR_7_00720	I'm a special agent for... Let's\ncall it an "investigation service."
ACR_7_00731	What's someone like you doing\ninfiltrating J.C. Valley?
ACR_7_00732	I was investigating the research\nbeing conducted here.
ACR_7_00733	There's something worth\ninvestigating here?
ACR_7_00734	The federal government\ncertainly thinks there is.
ACR_7_00735	J.C. Valley's work with human\nmemory is garnering attention.
ACR_7_00736	And the big question is if that\nresearch can be weaponized.
ACR_7_01420	We still don't have any\ndefinitive evidence.
ACR_7_00745	The ANOTHER...
ACR_7_00748	That does it.
ACR_7_00751	The gate's open. Let's hurry to\nthe security office.
ACR_7_00755	This is it.
ACR_7_01421	Dad! Are you here?!
ACR_7_01422	Empty...
ACR_7_01423	What the...
ACR_7_01424	Someone triggered a\nsystem error.
ACR_7_01425	This system is supposed to be\nsecure. Who could do this?
ACR_7_01426	Ian, where's my dad?
ACR_7_01427	I'll get the system back up\nand running.
ACR_7_01428	Use the security cameras to look\nfor him.
ACR_7_01429	Looks like we avoided a\nworst-case scenario.
ACR_7_01430	That's him!
ACR_7_01431	Dad!
ACR_7_01432	Another error? There must be\na hacker.
ACR_7_01433	But who? And from where?
ACR_7_01434	Whoever it is, they'll gain total\ncontrol if I leave this station.
ACR_7_01435	Then you stay here. I'll go find\nmy dad!
ACR_7_01436	No way, Ashley. It's too\ndangerous out there.
ACR_7_01437	But if we can stop Sofia in\nher tracks...
ACR_7_01438	OK, lend me a hand. I have a plan\nto stop her. Then you can go\nrescue your dad.
ACR_7_01439	Take a look at the monitor\non the right.
ACR_7_01440	Ha! I locked Sofia in that room!
ACR_7_01441	Great job, Ashley.
ACR_7_01442	That's one problem solved.
ACR_7_01443	Can you find my dad now?
ACR_7_01444	Sure.
ACR_7_01445	Dr. Robins is in liquid memory\nstorage on floor 3BF.
ACR_7_01446	Hold on, Dad... I'm on my way.
ACR_7_01447	I'll keep an eye on things here.\nGood luck.
ACR_7_01448	Dad!
ACR_7_00883	Ashley?
ACR_7_00887	What are you doing here?
ACR_7_00888	Are you all right? You\naren't hurt?
ACR_7_00889	I'm fine. What about you?
ACR_7_00894	I'm fine, but Sofia got the jump\non me. Now I'm handcuffed.
ACR_7_01449	I'll get those handcuffs off you.
ACR_7_01450	They're off!
ACR_7_01451	Thanks, Ashley... But how'd you\ndo that?
ACR_7_01452	It's all thanks to the RAS.
ACR_7_01453	I had no idea the RAS could do\nthings like that.
ACR_7_01454	So the RAS is loaded up with\nfeatures, huh?
ACR_7_01455	Why did Sayoko program\nthem in?
ACR_7_01456	Dad, I remembered something...
ACR_7_01457	I came to this room with Mom,\n13 years ago.
ACR_7_01458	What?
ACR_7_01459	She was arguing with Judd here.
ACR_7_01460	I'm pretty sure she was talking\nabout the ANOTHER...
ACR_7_01461	What did you say?
ACR_7_01462	Sayoko was called here by Judd\nthat day?
ACR_7_01463	Liquid memory is a storage\nmedium for ANOTHER...
ACR_7_01464	Maybe Judd wanted to revive\nthe ANOTHER project...
ACR_7_01465	So he called Sayoko for help?
ACR_7_01466	Dad?
ACR_7_01467	I'm glad you're all right.
ACR_7_01468	And I'm glad you're all right.
ACR_7_01469	I heard you were looking for me,\nso I came to the lab to find you.
ACR_7_01470	But Sofia caught me, I escaped,\nthen I met up with Gina...
ACR_7_01471	It's... It's been a lot. I'm kind of\nexhausted, to be honest...
ACR_7_01472	Someone said I was looking for\nyou? Who?
ACR_7_01473	Ryan.
ACR_7_01474	Ryan?
ACR_7_01475	It's weird though... Gina said she\ndoesn't know any Ryan.
ACR_7_01476	Did you meet this person?
ACR_7_01477	Yeah. Earlier today.
ACR_7_01478	He's helping Sofia.
ACR_7_01479	Huh?
ACR_7_01480	Do you remember on Blood\nEdward Island?
ACR_7_01481	Bill sent ANOTHER's source code\nto someone before he died.
ACR_7_01482	Right.
ACR_7_01483	That data was sent here, to\nJ.C. Valley.
ACR_7_01484	What?
ACR_7_01485	Once I realized this, I decided to\ntake a job here.
ACR_7_01486	I've been trying to figure out\nwho Bill was working with.
ACR_7_01487	What did you find?
ACR_7_01488	Just a lead. Bill was talking to\nsomeone named Ryan.
ACR_7_01489	Really? It has to be a different\nRyan, right?
ACR_7_01490	He seems really nice. He knew\nabout Mom.
ACR_7_01491	Ryan knew Sayoko?
ACR_7_01492	What is he after?
ACR_7_01493	If the ANOTHER is still somewhere\nat J.C. Valley...
ACR_7_01494	Dad? What's the matter?
ACR_7_01495	There's something I want to\nshow you.
ACR_7_01496	What is it?
ACR_7_01497	It's in my lab. Let's go.
ACR_7_01498	OK.
ACR_7_01499	Information on liquid memory is displayed\non the console.
ACR_7_01500	This reminds me of...
ACR_7_01501	It's the unknown contaminant\nMatthew and I found.
ACR_7_01502	What's the matter?
ACR_7_01503	Your computer unlocked a new\nfeature on the DAS.
ACR_7_01504	We saw you had investigated\nthe lake's water.
ACR_7_01505	Is it possible this is the source\nof the pollution?
ACR_7_01506	Yes... I noticed the water had\nchanged while out fishing one\nday, so I started looking into it.
ACR_7_01507	The pollution was this\nliquid memory.
ACR_7_01508	But how did it get into the lake?
ACR_7_01509	The supervisor told me there's\nnothing wrong with the tank.
ACR_7_01510	Really?
ACR_7_01511	So maybe somebody did it\ndeliberately.
ACR_7_01512	The truth is simply not yet clear.
ACR_7_00931	They've got to be around\nhere somewhere...
ACR_7_01513	Finally! Here they are!
ACR_7_01514	What's that?
ACR_7_01515	Plans for a prototype ANOTHER.\nI found them here.
ACR_7_01516	Early versions of the ANOTHER\nwere made here?
ACR_7_01517	That's right.
ACR_7_01518	Your mother was working here\nat J.C. Valley when I joined.
ACR_7_01519	She was on a top-secret project\nwith Judd.
ACR_7_01520	They were making a prototype\nversion of ANOTHER.
ACR_7_01521	But there was a serious flaw...\nSo it was shelved 15 years ago.
ACR_7_01522	I had no idea.
ACR_7_01523	It was the first time she'd failed\nas a researcher.
ACR_7_01524	After that, she reformulated her\ntheory on ANOTHER.
ACR_7_01525	And that became the research\npaper you two co-wrote?
ACR_7_01526	That's right.
ACR_7_01528	Do you recall seeing this sort of\ndevice here 13 years ago?
ACR_7_01529	Wait here, Ashley, OK?
ACR_7_01530	Mom...
ACR_7_01531	I did... I saw this ANOTHER.
ACR_7_01532	So it's true...
ACR_7_01533	Sayoko came here 13 years ago\nbecause Judd called her in...
ACR_7_01534	This prototype was here.
ACR_7_01535	Even though it should have\nbeen scrapped.
ACR_7_01536	What did Judd call Sayoko in\nfor that day?
ACR_7_01537	Where was the prototype\nANOTHER being kept?
ACR_7_01538	I don't understand, Sayoko...
ACR_7_01539	Dad...
ACR_7_01540	You think you're so safe with me\nlocked in here... Naive.
ACR_7_01854	(Exert Noise)
ACR_7_01541	Not good.
ACR_7_01542	What's wrong?
ACR_7_01543	Someone's accessing top-secret data.
ACR_7_01544	It must be Sofia.
ACR_7_01545	I've got to stop the data leak.
ACR_7_01546	I won't let her get away\nwith this...
ACR_7_01861	(Exert Noise)
ACR_7_01547	Phew. I stopped her in time.
ACR_7_01862	(Exert Noise)
ACR_7_01548	Grr!
ACR_7_01549	Amazing, Dad!
ACR_7_01550	All that's left is to copy the data\nto this disc...
ACR_7_01551	and delete it from the PC.
ACR_7_01552	That's it. The data Sofia's after\nis safe on this disc.
ACR_7_01553	I'm glad we can keep it safe.
ACR_7_01554	Me too... It's the source code\nfor the ANOTHER.
ACR_7_01555	So that's the data Bill sent?
ACR_7_01556	I'll keep the disc on me.
ACR_7_01557	And I'll uncover the truth behind\nthe ANOTHER hidden in J.C. Valley.
ACR_7_01558	Right.
ACR_7_01559	All right. Let's meet up with\nIan and Gina.
ACR_7_01560	Where are they?
ACR_7_01561	They should be waiting in the\nsecurity office. Let's go.
ACR_7_01562	Dr. Robins and Ashley are\nheading for the exit.
ACR_7_01563	He copied the data onto a disc\nand is carrying it in his pocket.
ACR_7_01051	I'm back!
ACR_7_01052	...
ACR_7_01055	Ashley! Dr. Robins!
ACR_7_01056	I'm so glad you're both safe.
ACR_7_01564	Are you OK, Gina?
ACR_7_01565	I'm fine. I've been here with Ian.
ACR_7_01566	He told me you went to rescue\nyour dad.
ACR_7_01057	Dr. Robins! Thank goodness.
ACR_7_01058	Nicely done, Ashley!
ACR_7_01062	Thank you, Gina... Ian...
ACR_7_01063	Thank you for helping Ashley.
ACR_7_01075	Where's Sofia now?
ACR_7_01567	She should be in room 203.
ACR_7_01077	She's not there.
ACR_7_01078	What?!
ACR_7_01081	She's gone...
ACR_7_01083	Seriously. She's nowhere\nto be found.
ACR_7_01084	What?
ACR_7_01087	What do we do, Dad?
ACR_7_01090	We stay calm.
ACR_7_01091	This will all work out as long as\nwe work together.
ACR_7_01093	He's right.
ACR_7_01094	Yes. We can do this.
ACR_7_01096	So, then, what's our strategy?
ACR_7_01097	You two stay hidden here.\nKeep safe.
ACR_7_01098	Ashley and I will head out. We'll\nkeep clear of Sofia.
ACR_7_01099	We'll take the elevator to the\nsurface and call for help.
ACR_7_01100	Understood. Gina and I will\nhunker down here.
ACR_7_01101	Good luck, Ian.
ACR_7_01103	You're up for this, right, Ashley?
ACR_7_01104	Of course!
ACR_7_01105	After all, you're lost without me.
ACR_7_01106	Am I ever.
ACR_7_01108	I kind of surprised myself,\nsaying that.
ACR_7_01109	This whole thing is so weird.
ACR_7_01110	But maybe Dad and I really\ndo work well together.
ACR_7_01112	Let's get going.
ACR_7_01113	Right.
ACR_7_01115	We'll see you soon.
ACR_7_01121	Don't move!
ACR_7_01124	Honestly... You two are more\ntrouble than you're worth.
ACR_7_01125	I should just shoot the two of\nyou and be done with it...
ACR_7_01127	But I was told to bring you\nin unharmed.
ACR_7_01129	Told by who?
ACR_7_01130	Who are you working for?
ACR_7_01131	There's the day's most\npredictable question.
ACR_7_01132	How's this? You'll find out.
ACR_7_01137	...
ACR_7_01138	Stay put.
ACR_7_01139	Try it again and you'll have to\nbe dragged out of here.
ACR_7_01141	Now, give it to me.
ACR_7_01142	Give what to you?
ACR_7_01144	Let's not do this.
ACR_7_01147	I know what you have, Doctor.
ACR_7_01148	Hand over the source code.
ACR_7_01149	How did you...
ACR_7_01150	We saw through everything.
ACR_7_01151	And, frankly, you saved me a lot\nof trouble.
ACR_7_01154	Ashley, the disc in your father's\npocket. Give it to me.
ACR_7_01155	What?
ACR_7_01156	Do as she says, Ashley.
ACR_7_01159	I finally have it. Ha!
ACR_7_01161	Is it really that valuable?
ACR_7_01162	I guess you're not one of those\nsmart kids, huh?
ACR_7_01163	There are people who would\npay anything for this disc.
ACR_7_01164	So you're just in this for money?
ACR_7_01165	You got a job here... You lied\nto everyone...
ACR_7_01166	And even got engaged to\nElizabeth's dad?!
ACR_7_01168	Hmhmhm...
ACR_7_01169	The amount of money that we're\ntalking about? I'd do anything.
ACR_7_01170	Elizabeth could tell who you\nreally are.
ACR_7_01171	That selfish brat? You're joking.
ACR_7_01173	Enough of this.
ACR_7_01174	Hand over the disc.
ACR_7_01177	Come here.
ACR_7_01185	What is this?!
ACR_7_01188	Haa!
ACR_7_01192	Ashley, run!
ACR_7_01194	Get to the elevator!
ACR_7_01197	Hold on, Dad!
ACR_7_01198	I'll get help!
ACR_7_01568	Go!
ACR_7_01204	Come on! Come on! Hurry up!
ACR_7_01207	Am I there?
ACR_7_01209	Huh?
ACR_7_01570	Oh no.
ACR_7_01571	Is it busted?
ACR_7_01211	Why?!
ACR_7_01213	Ugh, what now?
ACR_7_01574	Ashley.
ACR_7_01216	That voice...
ACR_7_01577	I'm waiting for you.
ACR_7_01857	(Exert Noise)
ACR_7_01858	(Exert Noise)
ACR_7_01581	Hya!
ACR_7_01582	Oof!
ACR_7_01859	(Exert Noise)
ACR_7_01860	(Exert Noise)
ACR_7_01583	A true scientist would analyze\nthe situation and see...
ACR_7_01584	You don't stand a chance.
ACR_7_01585	Ugh... Sofia...
ACR_7_01586	Doesn't matter...what you do...
ACR_7_01587	You won't...escape...
ACR_7_01588	Ashley's already...
ACR_7_01589	Made it out... Calling the police...
ACR_7_01590	Don't worry, Doctor.
ACR_7_01591	I can get the data later. The\nANOTHER's already powering up.
ACR_7_01592	Ashley is what he's after.
ACR_7_01593	What?
ACR_7_01594	I really must hurry after her...
ACR_7_01595	I don't want to miss my chance.
ACR_7_01852	(Exert Noise)
ACR_7_01596	Farewell, Dr. Robins.
ACR_7_01598	Ugh...
ACR_7_01853	(Exert Noise)
ACR_7_01855	(Exert Noise)
ACR_7_01856	(Exert Noise)
ACR_7_01599	Rex!
ACR_7_01600	Sofia... How could you?
ACR_7_01601	Thanks...
ACR_7_01602	Thank you, Richard.
ACR_7_01603	You did well to keep the\ndata safe.
ACR_7_01604	I'll leave Sofia to you, Ian.
ACR_7_01605	On it.
ACR_7_01606	Rex... Someone was helping Sofia.
ACR_7_01607	What?
ACR_7_01608	Someone named Ryan.
ACR_7_01609	He's the one who told Ashley to\ncome here.
ACR_7_01610	Did you say Ryan?
ACR_7_01611	Sofia said he's going\nafter Ashley.
ACR_7_01612	He's going to use the\nprototype ANOTHER.
ACR_7_01613	He'll get all the data.
ACR_7_01614	That can't be...
ACR_7_01615	I think I know what Sofia is after.
ACR_7_01616	You know what's going on?
ACR_7_01617	If you do, just tell me already.
ACR_7_01618	Why did Sayoko bring Ashley\nhere 13 years ago?
ACR_7_01619	Why did she meet with Judd?
ACR_7_01620	The truth...
ACR_7_01621	Lies in the pendant\nAshley wears...
ACR_7_01622	You've remembered, haven't\nyou? That day with your mother.
ACR_7_01623	Ryan!
ACR_7_01624	I've been waiting, Ashley...
ACR_7_01625	For you and the DAS.
ACR_7_01626	You can't trick me anymore.
ACR_7_01627	You're working with Sofia.
ACR_7_01628	And you were working with\nBill too!
ACR_7_01629	Working with them? No.\nYou're mistaken.
ACR_7_01630	I needed them only briefly to\nfulfill my goals.
ACR_7_01631	They were mere tools.\nEasily manipulated.
ACR_7_01632	That's a terrible way to treat\npeople.
ACR_7_01633	What are you thinking?
ACR_7_01634	What do you hope to accomplish\nby calling me here?!
ACR_7_01635	Don't just stand there.\nAnswer me!
ACR_7_01636	Please try to relax.
ACR_7_01637	Heightened emotions will cause\nyour brain undue stress.
ACR_7_01638	And your feelings are\nnot necessary...
ACR_7_01639	in order to use the ANOTHER.
ACR_7_01640	You're not making any sense!
ACR_7_01641	That just won't do, Ashley.
ACR_7_01642	Look into my eyes.
ACR_7_01643	Uh...
ACR_7_01644	Allow me to introduce you...
ACR_7_01645	to Sayoko.
ACR_7_01838	The RAS lit up! So the DAS...
ACR_7_01839	All right, it's responding. I think\nthis will do it.
ACR_7_01841	Let's use the DAS to lift\nthe security.
ACR_7_01844	The RAS isn't responding...
ACR_7_01845	Hmm... The light on this device\nis off.
ACR_7_01846	Maybe that's why the RAS isn't\nresponding... Let's see.
ACR_Mystery_7_1_00011	One more try can't hurt.
ACR_Mystery_7_1_00015	Hm. Still nothing.
ACR_Mystery_7_2_00006	One more try can't hurt.
ACR_Mystery_7_2_00007	Crud. Still not opening.
ACR_Mystery_7_2_00008	What'll you do now, Ashley?
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00005	The door has secured access.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00006	All right. Let's see if I can get\nthis unlocked.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00007	Crud. It won't open...
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00011	The door has secured access.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00014	The device's power-indicator light is off.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00016	The cover is about to fall off.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00018	Then these are the insides, huh?
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00019	The circuit board is exposed.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00020	Gina, look. Think this is broken?
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00021	That socket is missing its\nIC chip!
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00096	It won't work in this state... Who\nwould go to this much trouble?
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00022	But if I replace the chip, it should\nwork, right?
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00097	It should, yes.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00098	...It's possible Dr. Robins has\na suitable replacement chip.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00099	We should check his lab to see\nif we can find one. Room 202.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00023	There's an empty chip socket.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00024	We'll need to find the chip first.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00100	We should head to Dad's lab.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00025	Maybe that chip I found earlier\nwill fit here...
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00029	There's a trash can.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00030	It's empty.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00038	Lots of junk but no IC chip, huh?
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00040	Circuit boards and other equipment have been\nplaced on the shelf.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00043	Junk everywhere, and yet the\ngarbage can is empty... OK.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00101	No IC chip here either.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00045	Dad's coat pocket, maybe?\nCould it be there?
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00046	Nothing here...
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00047	There's a coat on the rack.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00102	It's kinda dusty... Probably hasn't\nbeen touched in a while.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00103	I should look around more.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00104	There's a stack of cardboard boxes.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00055	Here's Dad's lab... Let's go inside.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00056	We need to find that IC chip.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00058	We should split up. I'll look over\nthis way.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00060	I can't find it. I have no idea\nwhere the IC chip should be.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00105	It may not be here.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00106	If it's not here, we could check\nSofia's lab... It's risky though.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00107	Where's Sofia's lab?
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00108	Lab 203.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00109	This isn't Dad's lab, is it?
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00110	I thought his lab was number 202.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00111	This is Sofia's lab, but the door\nis locked...
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00112	This thing has power. We might\nbe able to open the door!
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00113	We got it open!
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00114	Good work, Ashley. Now we can\ntake a look around inside.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00115	Let's go.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00116	OK. Follow me.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00117	All clear. No one's around.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00118	All right. So, this is Sofia's lab...
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00119	Think we'll actually find the IC\nchip for the other door in here?
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00120	We'll just have to look.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00121	Let's split up.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00122	I'll take the desk area.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00072	There's nothing here.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00123	There's my cell phone. We can\ncontact the outside with it.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00124	Ah, crud. The battery's dead.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00125	Too bad I don't have the charger.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00126	There's my sheet music. I'm\nso glad it's in one piece.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00127	Here's my wallet. All the cash\nis still inside and everything.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00128	Our album!
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00129	Phew. It's not even scratched.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00130	My teddy bear too? He's still in\ngood shape. Not even dirty!
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00131	Who would throw this out?!\nNot cool, Sofia.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00080	Oh, hey. There's something at the\nbottom of the garbage can.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00081	Hey, Gina, any idea what this is?
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00082	That's the IC chip! So Sofia must\nhave taken it out of the door.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00083	Now that we have it, we should\nbe able to turn the door on!
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00085	Could the chip be in one of\nthe pockets?
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00086	Guess not...
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00087	There's a coat on the rack.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00089	Inside the vase, maybe?
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00090	I'm probably overthinking it now.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00091	There are yellow flowers in the vase.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00132	Gotta keep looking around.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00093	OK. I'm using the chip we found.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00094	We should be able to open\nthe door.
ACR_Mystery_7_3_00095	Wait—this isn't it.
ACR_Mystery_7_4_00006	One more try can't hurt.
ACR_Mystery_7_4_00007	Crud. Still not opening.
ACR_Mystery_7_5_00047	There's a calendar at the reception desk.
ACR_Mystery_7_5_00048	Ugh. How is summer vacation\nalmost over already?
ACR_Mystery_7_5_00049	There's a calendar at the reception desk.
ACR_Mystery_7_5_00050	The date says August 24th, 2007.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00032	What do I do now, Ian?
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00001	The security feed is displayed\non the monitor, right?
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00002	First, confirm Sofia's location.\nThen, lock the door to that room.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00003	How do I lock the door? Is there\na button?
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00033	All you have to do is tap the\nroom on the monitor.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00034	All right. I'll see what I can do.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00004	You can view the security feeds\nand control all the door locks\nfrom here.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00005	But it seems the system has yet\nto fully recover.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00006	Oh no! The picture's all...weird.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00007	That's a result of the hacking.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00008	Ashley, I'll do what I can to block\nthe hack.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00009	While I do that, you find and lock\nSofia's door!
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00016	I'm on it!
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00017	I've gotta lock Sofia in her\nroom before she leaves.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00018	Ah, crud! That was the\nwrong room...
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00019	Don't worry, Ashley. I'll restart\nthe system. You can try again!
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00020	Perfect. Sofia's still in that room.\nNow I've got her.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00035	Huh... Is Sofia in a different\nplace than before?
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00021	Dang it! I messed up again!
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00022	It's OK. Take some deep breaths.\nYou've got this.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00023	Thanks! I'll get it this time.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00024	OK. Let's try that again...
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00025	I need to focus on blocking the\nhack right now.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00036	This is the map, right?
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00037	All the room numbers are turned\noff due to the hack attempt.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00038	You'll have to look at the map\nand room layouts closely.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00039	The layout of the cameras and\ndesks should help you.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00040	OK. I'll give it a shot.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00028	Start with the monitor on the\nright-hand side.
ACR_Mystery_7_6_00031	I've gotta lock Sofia in her\nroom first.
ACR_Mystery_7_7_00006	Hang on. I'm about to unlock it.
ACR_Mystery_7_7_00007	Just a little longer, Dad...
ACR_Mystery_7_7_00008	I need to help Dad.
ACR_8_Scenario_00156	And who is...
ACR_8_Scenario_00157	What's he have to show us?
ACR_8_Scenario_00158	Ashley, would you mind\nanswering that?
ACR_8_Scenario_00159	I wonder who it could be.
ACR_8_Scenario_00196	The mystery around Ryan is\nrelated to Judd's experiment?
ACR_8_Scenario_00160	What did Judd leave?
ACR_8_Scenario_00146	Sayoko's truth
ACR_8_Scenario_00147	Complete the ANOTHER
ACR_8_Scenario_00148	Find Michael
ACR_8_Scenario_00149	Investigate the pollution
ACR_8_Scenario_00150	Find the RAS
ACR_8_Scenario_00151	Thirteen years ago, Mom came to Lake Juliet\nwithout telling Dad. He came here to find out\nwhy and what she was doing here.
ACR_8_Scenario_00152	The prototype ANOTHER was secretly left at\nJ.C. Valley. Dad came here to complete the\nproject.
ACR_8_Scenario_00153	Matthew's dad Michael went missing five years\nago, when Crusoe Resort went bankrupt.\nDad came to J.C. Valley to help Matthew look\nfor him.
ACR_8_Scenario_00154	Five years ago, Lake Juliet became contaminated.\nPeople thought it was caused by the resort\ndevelopment, but Dad must have come here to\nlook for the real cause.
ACR_8_Scenario_00155	Mom made the RAS to counteract the effects of\nANOTHER in case it was abused. Dad came here\nto find the RAS Mom left behind.
ACR_8_Scenario_00171	No, that's not why Dad came to\nJ.C. Valley.
ACR_8_Scenario_00073	Stay safe.
ACR_8_Scenario_00074	Let me know if you\nwant anything.
ACR_8_Scenario_00075	Stay safe.
ACR_8_Scenario_00076	You're going to get a souvenir\nfor Jessica too, right?
ACR_8_Scenario_00077	I'm sure she would appreciate it.
ACR_8_Scenario_00078	Of course.
ACR_8_Scenario_00079	Just...keep an eye on\nyour spending.
ACR_8_Scenario_00199	Go say bye to everyone. I'll be\nwaiting at the bus stop.
ACR_8_Scenario_00080	I'm a bit early for the bus.
ACR_8_Scenario_00081	It would be nice to see everyone\none more time before I go.
ACR_8_Scenario_00082	Stop by again, OK?
ACR_8_Scenario_00083	The Salmon Rice Burger will be\nwaiting for you, along with your\nnew friends!
ACR_8_Scenario_00084	Come back anytime.
ACR_8_Scenario_00085	See ya soon, Ashley!
ACR_8_Scenario_00086	Sure thing. See you.
ACR_8_Scenario_00172	I can't stay too long. I don't want\nto miss the bus.
ACR_8_Scenario_00173	I can't stay too long. I don't want\nto miss the bus.
ACR_8_Scenario_00174	I'll be late for the bus if I stay\ntoo long...
ACR_8_Scenario_00087	All right, hurry along now before\nyou miss your bus.
ACR_8_Scenario_00088	Be sure to visit Lake Juliet\nagain sometime.
ACR_8_Scenario_00089	Good kids like you are\nalways welcome.
ACR_8_Scenario_00090	Take care of yourself, OK?
ACR_8_Scenario_00091	Thanks. You too.
ACR_8_Scenario_00175	As much as I enjoy climbing,\nI don't want to miss the bus.
ACR_8_Scenario_00176	There's nothing for me to\ndo here.
ACR_8_Scenario_00177	This isn't the way to the bus stop.
ACR_8_Scenario_00178	There's nothing for me to\ndo here.
ACR_8_Scenario_00092	I guess the next time I see you\nwill be at the contest.
ACR_8_Scenario_00093	I guess so.
ACR_8_Scenario_00094	Oh, right...
ACR_8_Scenario_00095	I need to return the key card to\nthe guesthouse.
ACR_8_Scenario_00096	Forget to say bye to someone?
ACR_8_Scenario_00097	Yeah, I still need to\ndo something.
ACR_8_Scenario_00098	No worries. Here's your key\ncard back.
ACR_8_Scenario_00099	But it's against the rules, so don't\ntell anyone.
ACR_8_Scenario_00100	You borrowed a key card from Tommy.
ACR_8_Scenario_00101	Nah, I'm all done.
ACR_8_Scenario_00102	Then have a safe trip home!
ACR_8_Scenario_00103	Have you said all your\ngoodbyes?
ACR_8_Scenario_00104	Yep. All done.
ACR_8_Scenario_00105	Then you're officially\nchecked out.
ACR_8_Scenario_00106	Thanks for everything.
ACR_8_Scenario_00107	Of course. Anytime.
ACR_8_Scenario_00108	You returned the key card to Tommy.
ACR_8_Scenario_00109	I think I need a little more time\nto see everyone.
ACR_8_Scenario_00110	No problem. Go ahead.
ACR_8_Scenario_00112	Thanks.
ACR_8_Scenario_00179	I don't need to go into the\nstorage room.
ACR_8_Scenario_00195	Still looking to do\nsome shopping?
ACR_8_Scenario_00197	It's not too late?
ACR_8_Scenario_00198	Nah, I'll add it to your dad's tab.\nTake a look, see if there's\nanything else you want.
ACR_8_Scenario_00181	The gate is installed with a card-reader\nsecurity device.
ACR_8_Scenario_00182	I already returned the key card.\nI can't get back in.
ACR_8_Scenario_00183	Maybe I can borrow one\nfrom Tommy...
ACR_8_Scenario_00122	The bus will be here any minute.
ACR_8_Scenario_00123	Did you forget anything, Ashley?
ACR_8_Scenario_00124	I may have forgotten to talk\nto someone.
ACR_8_Scenario_00125	Just make it back before the bus\ngets here, OK?
ACR_8_Scenario_00127	I'll be right back.
ACR_8_01230	Huh?
ACR_8_01231	That can't be right... Is the\nelevator malfunctioning?
ACR_8_01232	It's not a malfunction.
ACR_8_01233	What is it?
ACR_8_01234	Richard... I have to tell you\nsomething known only to\ndirectors.
ACR_8_01235	J.C. Valley has a secret lab.
ACR_8_01236	So that's where this elevator\nis now...
ACR_8_01237	Wait, is that where Ashley is?!
ACR_8_01238	Let's go.
ACR_8_01239	Is this the lab?
ACR_8_01240	Yes.
ACR_8_01241	Ashley!
ACR_8_01242	The pendant...
ACR_8_01243	The ANOTHER is active!
ACR_8_01244	The control room's over there.
ACR_8_01245	There's no one here.
ACR_8_01246	Then who's operating it?
ACR_8_01247	There's the pendant.
ACR_8_01248	It contains liquid memory.
ACR_8_01249	Liquid memory that belonged\nto Sayoko...
ACR_8_01250	The very data Judd deleted from\nher mind 13 years ago.
ACR_8_01251	It's what?
ACR_8_01252	Sayoko quit after Ashley\nwas born.
ACR_8_01253	Judd demanded she return and\ncontinue her research.
ACR_8_01254	But she refused. So he stole\nher memories.
ACR_8_01255	And you waited until now to\ntell me?!
ACR_8_01256	Syncing with subject's brain waves.
ACR_8_01257	Sync with subject's brain waves successful.
ACR_8_01258	Loading external episodic memories.
ACR_8_01259	External episodic memories successfully loaded.
ACR_8_01260	Installing external episodic memories.
ACR_8_01261	External episodic memories\nsuccessfully installed.
ACR_8_01262	Who's operating the ANOTHER?!
ACR_8_01263	I don't know, but Sayoko's\nmemory data has been loaded\ninto it.
ACR_8_01264	We need to shut it down!
ACR_8_01265	It's no use, it's not responding.
ACR_8_01266	I'm going to go check on Ashley.
ACR_8_01267	Locked.
ACR_8_01268	Richard, the ANOTHER is being\nused to overwrite memories.
ACR_8_01269	Sayoko's memory data is going\nto fully overwrite Ashley's.
ACR_8_01270	It's writing to her?!
ACR_8_01271	Yes...
ACR_8_01272	Is such a thing even possible?\nTransferring Sayoko's memory\ndata into Ashley's mind?
ACR_8_01273	Perfect memory transcription\nrequires compatible DNA.
ACR_8_01274	As Sayoko's daughter, it's\ntheoretically possible.
ACR_8_01275	What happens to the memories\nof the person being written to?
ACR_8_01276	What will happen to my\ndaughter's memories?!
ACR_8_01277	It's most likely they'll be lost.
ACR_8_01278	Ashley!
ACR_8_01279	This is going smoothly.
ACR_8_01280	We'll see each other soon, Sayoko...
ACR_8_02209	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_01281	Where am I?
ACR_8_01282	This place is so weird...
ACR_8_01283	What's this floating around?
ACR_8_01284	Mom?
ACR_8_01285	You've grown so much, Ashley.
ACR_8_01286	Is it really you?
ACR_8_01287	It is, isn't it?
ACR_8_01288	Mom!
ACR_8_01289	I can't believe it.
ACR_8_01290	I'll try the force-quit command.
ACR_8_01291	Do it.
ACR_8_01292	No good... It's not responding.
ACR_8_01293	Installing external episodic memories.
ACR_8_01294	External episodic memories\nsuccessfully installed.
ACR_8_01295	Ashley...
ACR_8_01296	Protect our daughter, Sayoko...
ACR_8_00318	Where are we?
ACR_8_00319	Inside your memories.
ACR_8_00320	Huh?
ACR_8_00321	My memories are flowing\ninto yours.
ACR_8_00341	Ashley, you're in grave danger.
ACR_8_01297	Ryan's trying to overwrite your\nmemories with mine.
ACR_8_01298	He's trying to revive me in\nyour body.
ACR_8_01299	What?
ACR_8_01300	But I have no intention of letting\nthat happen.
ACR_8_01301	I won't allow it.
ACR_8_01302	Mom...
ACR_8_01303	If he overwrites my memories\nwith yours... What happens to me?
ACR_8_00342	The mind cannot cope with\nmultiple sets of memories.
ACR_8_00343	Your brain will prioritize\nthe new memories. Mine.
ACR_8_00344	The older information, your\nmemories, will be deleted.
ACR_8_00345	I'll lose my memories?
ACR_8_01304	Yes. And if that happens, you'll\nno longer be you.
ACR_8_00346	I'm scared, Mom...
ACR_8_00355	It's all right.
ACR_8_00356	I'll help keep you safe.
ACR_8_00361	There's one more feature to the\nRAS. I designed it in secret.
ACR_8_00362	It can restore memories that\nhave been overwritten.
ACR_8_00363	What do I need to do?
ACR_8_00364	Hold out your hand.
ACR_8_00367	It's gone?
ACR_8_00368	Yes. Just like that.
ACR_8_00369	Keep doing this, and your own\nmemories will be safe.
ACR_8_01305	You're safe now, Ashley.\nYou'll keep your memories.
ACR_8_01306	Thank you, Mom.
ACR_8_01307	You saved me.
ACR_8_01308	I'm so relieved.
ACR_8_01309	What was that?
ACR_8_01310	A fragment of my memory.
ACR_8_01311	Ashley, go.
ACR_8_01312	Your father is waiting for you.
ACR_8_01313	I don't want to lose you again!
ACR_8_02204	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_01314	No tears, now...
ACR_8_01315	Remember this...
ACR_8_01316	A person will experience two deaths...
ACR_8_02205	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_01317	The first is when their soul leaves their body.
ACR_8_01318	And the second...
ACR_8_01319	is when the memories of that person\nfade from everyone's hearts.
ACR_8_01320	As long as you keep me in your heart...
ACR_8_01321	I'll be with you forever.
ACR_8_02206	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_02191	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_01322	Ashley...
ACR_8_02192	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_02207	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_02208	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_01323	Protect our daughter, Richard...
ACR_8_01325	Ugh...
ACR_8_01326	Sayoko...
ACR_8_01327	I've missed you.
ACR_8_01328	Sayoko?
ACR_8_01329	No.
ACR_8_01330	Ashley.
ACR_8_01331	My mom is gone...
ACR_8_01332	Sayoko's gone?
ACR_8_01333	She used the RAS to protect me.
ACR_8_01334	The what?
ACR_8_01335	It can control the ANOTHER.\nMy mom made it for me.
ACR_8_01336	It can erase memories.
ACR_8_01337	And you used this device\non Sayoko's?
ACR_8_01338	Yes... I erased the memories you\nwere trying to write onto me.
ACR_8_01339	If Sayoko made that and left it\nfor you, then...
ACR_8_01340	I spoke to her in my memories.
ACR_8_01341	She said you were trying to\nrevive her in my body... And\nthat she wouldn't let you.
ACR_8_01342	She wouldn't let me...
ACR_8_01343	I understand, Sayoko... I see now\nthat I was wrong.
ACR_8_01344	I just wanted to see you. More\nthan anything.
ACR_8_01345	So my efforts were all\nfor nothing.
ACR_8_01346	Ryan, please, tell me... What\nwould make you do that?
ACR_8_01347	You'd never understand.
ACR_8_01348	What?
ACR_8_01349	This is the end.
ACR_8_01350	Sooner or later, you'll forget me.
ACR_8_01351	Huh?
ACR_8_01352	...
ACR_8_01353	Ryan?
ACR_8_01354	Ashley!
ACR_8_01355	Dad!
ACR_8_01356	Are you all right?
ACR_8_01357	Mom saved me. She had me\nuse the RAS.
ACR_8_01358	She told me... She told me to\nerase her memories.
ACR_8_01359	Why would she do that?
ACR_8_01360	Where's Ryan?
ACR_8_01361	He's the one who brought me\nhere. He used the ANOTHER.
ACR_8_01362	Ryan?
ACR_8_01363	He was just here. Where'd he go?
ACR_8_01364	It's all right, Ashley.
ACR_8_01365	We're the only ones here.
ACR_8_01366	Really?
ACR_8_01367	We didn't see anyone else.
ACR_8_01368	Just you.
ACR_8_01369	But he was here!
ACR_8_01370	We were just talking.
ACR_8_01371	Where'd he go?
ACR_8_01372	Dad, who is Ryan? Really.
ACR_8_01373	Well...
ACR_8_01374	Ashley, Richard.
ACR_8_01375	There's something I want to\nshow you.
ACR_8_01376	Let's go to my office.
ACR_8_01377	Look at this photo.
ACR_8_01378	Looks pretty old.
ACR_8_01379	That's Judd on the right, but\nwho's that boy?
ACR_8_01380	That's Judd's son... Ryan.
ACR_8_01381	Ryan?
ACR_8_01382	He looks just like the guy I met.
ACR_8_01383	Then does this mean that the\nman Ashley met...
ACR_8_01384	is Judd's son, all grown up?
ACR_8_01385	It must!
ACR_8_01386	How else would he have known\nabout the secret lab?
ACR_8_01387	And the prototype ANOTHER!
ACR_8_01388	No, it's impossible.
ACR_8_01389	The Ryan in this photograph\ndied 15 years ago.
ACR_8_01390	No way...
ACR_8_01391	Ryan was Judd's only son. His\nmother died when he was young.
ACR_8_01392	They were out on a walk, there\nwas a reckless driver... She\nsaved his life.
ACR_8_01393	Ryan withdrew into himself after\nwitnessing his mother's death.
ACR_8_01394	He stopped expressing himself.\nAnd then he stopped speaking\nentirely.
ACR_8_01395	Oh...
ACR_8_01396	So 15 years ago, Judd made\na decision...
ACR_8_01397	He would do anything to get\nhis son back.
ACR_8_01398	The ANOTHER was still just a\nprototype at the time...
ACR_8_01399	But he wanted to use it on Ryan,\nto erase memories of his mother\nand her death.
ACR_8_01400	Judd experimented on his\nown son?
ACR_8_01401	Yes.
ACR_8_01402	The experiment was conducted\nin total secrecy.
ACR_8_01403	Only Sayoko and I were there\nto witness it.
ACR_8_01404	1992, J.C. Valley, ANOTHER Room
ACR_8_01405	Rex, this experiment is dangerous.
ACR_8_01406	I know.
ACR_8_01407	But Judd is obsessed.
ACR_8_01408	The memory of that tragedy\ntook you from me...
ACR_8_01409	But I know I can use the ANOTHER somehow...
ACR_8_01410	I will bring you back.
ACR_8_01411	Ryaaaan!
ACR_8_01412	Judd's son, Ryan...
ACR_8_01413	was the first test subject of the prototype\nANOTHER. And it killed him.
ACR_8_01414	But his memories were not lost.
ACR_8_01415	That was the first practical use\nof liquid memory storage.
ACR_8_01416	His memories had been backed\nup before deletion.
ACR_8_01417	Ryan was gone.
ACR_8_01418	And all Judd had left of him\nwas his memory data, stored\nin liquid form.
ACR_8_01419	I had no idea about any of this.
ACR_8_01420	The experiment was strictly\nconfidential, by Judd's orders.
ACR_8_01421	And with Judd and Sayoko gone,\nI was the only one who knew\nwhat happened.
ACR_8_01422	I always thought I would take\nthese secrets to my grave...
ACR_8_01423	But you two deserved to know.
ACR_8_01424	I needed to tell you <color=#00994CFF>Judd's secret</color>\nand <color=#00994CFF>Sayoko's truth</color>.
ACR_8_01425	Judd approached Sayoko at J.C.\nValley, 13 years ago.
ACR_8_01426	She wanted to go back to her\nfamily, but he told her it would\nbe a waste of her brilliance.
ACR_8_01427	He told her to come back to\nwork. Otherwise, she knew\ntoo much.
ACR_8_01428	But Sayoko refused. She had\nmade up her mind.
ACR_8_01429	Judd offered a condition for her\nleaving, which Sayoko accepted...
ACR_8_01430	To erase her memories of the\nANOTHER project?
ACR_8_01431	Yes. I'm sure Sayoko realized how\nangry Judd was.
ACR_8_01432	She knew that if she refused...
ACR_8_01433	She wouldn't be able to\nkeep her family safe.
ACR_8_01434	I had no idea...
ACR_8_01435	We used the prototype ANOTHER\nto erase Sayoko's memories.
ACR_8_01436	And Judd ordered me to\nserve as the operator.
ACR_8_01437	It was I who extracted and\nerased Sayoko's memories.
ACR_8_01438	She was in a daze\nonce it was all over.
ACR_8_01439	She was crying. She looked\nat me and said,
ACR_8_01440	"I've lost something important."
ACR_8_01441	I remember Mom crying.
ACR_8_01442	She was sad because she lost her\nmemories of her research?
ACR_8_01443	No. She lost more than memories\nof her research.
ACR_8_01444	She lost memories of you.
ACR_8_01445	Oh no...
ACR_8_01446	When I saw her tears, I made a\ndecision, then and there.
ACR_8_01447	I took Sayoko's liquid\nmemory backup and\nstored it in that pendant.
ACR_8_01448	She was waiting in the clock\ntower when I gave it to her.
ACR_8_01449	She cherished the memories in\nthat pendant more than anything\nin her life.
ACR_8_01450	Memories of you.
ACR_8_01451	What did you mean by\nJudd's secret?
ACR_8_01452	Five years ago, Judd died\nin the lab.
ACR_8_01453	Afterward, I was organizing his\nresearch papers.
ACR_8_01454	Most of them were retained by\nJ.C. Valley.
ACR_8_01455	But there's one file I decided\nto keep private...
ACR_8_01456	It's here on this computer.
ACR_8_01457	\n　"2002 - Report: Mass Simultaneous\n　　Memory Rewrite Experiment"\n\n　The following is a record of an\n　experiment using the ANOTHER installed\n　in J.C. Valley's security system, capable\n　of remote control. The purpose of the\n　experiment was to attempt to rewrite\n　the short-term memory of a large\n　amount of subjects via surveillance\n　cameras. The experiment determined...
ACR_8_01458	He built a remote-controlled\nANOTHER?!
ACR_8_01459	Judd conducted an experiment\nthat crossed a terrible line.
ACR_8_01460	In order to protect J.C. Valley\nand to continue his research...
ACR_8_01461	he came up with a way to shift\nthe blame of the lake pollution,\nwhich was caused by an overflow\nof liquid memory.
ACR_8_01462	He blamed it on Crusoe Resort.
ACR_8_01463	He manipulated residents'\nmemories. Planted thoughts\nin their heads.
ACR_8_01464	Planted thoughts...
ACR_8_01465	That must have been what\nCharlotte was talking about.
ACR_8_01466	She said something strange\nhappened five years ago.
ACR_8_01467	Everyone started blaming\nCrusoe Resort overnight.
ACR_8_01468	The ANOTHER was used to\ncover it up?
ACR_8_01469	Dad, is it OK to use it like this?
ACR_8_01470	No way, right?
ACR_8_01471	I'm sorry.
ACR_8_01472	It was my foolish decision to\ncover this up.
ACR_8_01473	I wanted to protect J.C. Valley's\nand Judd's reputations.
ACR_8_01474	Rex... Do you think...
ACR_8_01475	Do you think that Judd's\nexperimental system is\nrelated...
ACR_8_01476	to Ashley meeting Ryan?
ACR_8_01477	Who could be calling?
ACR_8_01478	Ashley, you're safe!
ACR_8_01479	I'm fine.
ACR_8_01480	What a relief. Are you with the\ndirector and Dr. Robins?
ACR_8_01481	Ian, Gina! What happened?
ACR_8_01482	We've secured Sofia and have\ncontrol of the security system.
ACR_8_01483	Gina helped get it up\nand running.
ACR_8_01484	We can contact the outside now.
ACR_8_01485	We're going to call the police.
ACR_8_01486	Wait, Ian... There's something I\nwant you to look into first.
ACR_8_01487	Are the security cameras\nworking?
ACR_8_01488	No, they've been down for a\nwhile now.
ACR_8_01489	I was getting nervous, not being\nable to find you guys.
ACR_8_01490	I'm looking into the outage but\nhaven't been able to figure out\nwhat's causing it.
ACR_8_01491	Can you access security-\ncamera footage?
ACR_8_01492	Yeah. Why?
ACR_8_01493	Ashley, do you remember where\nyou saw Ryan?
ACR_8_01494	Yeah.
ACR_8_01495	I first saw him at the campsite,\nthen at his cottage.
ACR_8_01496	Then he found me at the Crusoe\nResort offices.
ACR_8_01497	Did you get that, Ian?
ACR_8_01498	Check the footage from where\nAshley just mentioned.
ACR_8_01499	I want to see all the footage\nof her.
ACR_8_01500	Copy that.
ACR_8_01501	Dad, what are you trying to\nfigure out here?
ACR_8_01502	You'll know soon enough...
ACR_8_01503	Found it, Dr. Robins.
ACR_8_01504	I'll send the footage through.
ACR_8_01505	He's not there.
ACR_8_01506	But why, Dad? What's going on?
ACR_8_01507	You remember speaking with\nRyan, yet he's not in the footage.
ACR_8_01508	Which means...
ACR_8_01509	This Ryan is some sort of\nconstruct, built by the ANOTHER.
ACR_8_01510	And Judd's remote-controlled\nANOTHER was temporarily\noverwriting her memories.
ACR_8_01511	Do you concur?
ACR_8_01512	I do.
ACR_8_01513	A construct?
ACR_8_01514	So Ryan was a false memory...
ACR_8_01515	that the ANOTHER implanted\nin me?
ACR_8_01516	That's right.
ACR_8_01517	I can't believe it.
ACR_8_01518	He seemed so real.
ACR_8_01519	So, Rex, Ryan's physical form is\nundoubtedly a construct...
ACR_8_01520	But a construct with an\nestablished personality.
ACR_8_01521	What's more, it intentionally\nsought out Ashley.
ACR_8_01522	The personality is that of Ryan,\nwho died 15 years ago...
ACR_8_01523	Which means...
ACR_8_01524	I mean, this may sound absurd,\nbut it seems...
ACR_8_01525	as if Ryan's memory data has\ncontinued to live all this time.
ACR_8_01526	Mom was alive.
ACR_8_01527	That's how I was able to talk\nto her.
ACR_8_01528	Mom was alive all along. Inside\nmemories converted to data.
ACR_8_01529	Dr. Robins!
ACR_8_01530	What is it, Gina?
ACR_8_01531	One of the security cameras\njust came back online.
ACR_8_01532	Which camera?
ACR_8_01533	The one watching the island\nin the lake.
ACR_8_01534	Show us the feed.
ACR_8_01535	Got it.
ACR_8_01536	A grave? Whose grave is that?
ACR_8_01537	It's Ryan's. He was buried there\n15 years ago.
ACR_8_01538	Ah...
ACR_8_01540	What's the matter, Ashley?
ACR_8_01541	Mom took me to that grave.
ACR_8_01542	What?
ACR_8_01543	She touched it and\nsaid something...
ACR_8_01544	Dad, take me to that island.
ACR_8_01545	I want to remember what\nshe said.
ACR_8_01546	Going there is my best shot.
ACR_8_01547	I don't know...
ACR_8_01548	I need to remember, Dad.
ACR_8_01549	If I do, maybe we'll find out why...
ACR_8_01550	Why Ryan appeared only to me.
ACR_8_01551	And why he wanted to bring Mom\nback. What his goal really was...
ACR_8_01552	All right. Let's go.
ACR_8_01553	Sayoko, what's your connection\nto Ryan?
ACR_8_01554	Help me understand who he\nreally is.
ACR_8_00658	This is our first time on a boat\ntogether, huh?
ACR_8_00659	I suppose it is.
ACR_8_00660	How'd you get so good\nat rowing?
ACR_8_00661	Sometimes I'll row when I go\nfishing with Bob and Rex.
ACR_8_00662	It'll be dawn soon.
ACR_8_00663	How are you holding up?
ACR_8_00664	It's been a busy day.\nBut I'm all right.
ACR_8_00668	What about you?
ACR_8_00677	Oh, I'm used to all-nighters. I'm\ntougher than I look, you know.
ACR_8_00688	Where's Ryan's grave?
ACR_8_00689	That way. Let's hurry.
ACR_8_01555	What is this place?
ACR_8_01556	It's the lake's spring. Not many\npeople know about it.
ACR_8_01557	According to Dan, it's the source\nof Lake Juliet.
ACR_8_01558	It all comes from here?
ACR_8_01559	Yep. The whole lake wells out\nfrom this one point.
ACR_8_01560	It's also responsible for keeping\nit clean.
ACR_8_01561	Lake Juliet's been polluted a\nnumber of times, but the spring\nalways restores its waters.
ACR_8_01562	So even the current pollution will\nbe cleaned up soon?
ACR_8_01563	As long as the spring holds out.
ACR_8_01564	That must be why Judd chose\nto put Ryan's grave here...
ACR_8_01565	The spring restores it all.
ACR_8_01566	This is Ryan's grave.
ACR_8_01567	So your mom brought you\nhere 13 years ago...
ACR_8_01568	I think this will be the last time\nI come here, Ryan.
ACR_8_01569	Judd left his most precious\npossession with you.
ACR_8_01570	So I'll leave mine here too.
ACR_8_01571	I remember what she said!
ACR_8_01572	She said Judd left his most\nprecious possession here.
ACR_8_01573	Let's take a look around.
ACR_8_01574	There's an inscription on the gravestone.
ACR_8_01575	Ryan Fitzgerald\n　1980 - 1992
ACR_8_01576	Ryan was only 12 when he died.
ACR_8_01577	I've seen this before...
ACR_8_01578	Looking through this always\nmade Sayoko miss Japan.
ACR_8_01579	Dad!
ACR_8_01580	What is it?
ACR_8_01581	Check it out!
ACR_8_01582	Ryan's mom gave him this\nkaleidoscope.
ACR_8_01583	He told me when we were talking\nat the cottage.
ACR_8_01584	He said he had to undergo\ntreatments as a kid.
ACR_8_01585	That's when he would give it to\nMom for safekeeping.
ACR_8_01586	"Undergoing treatment" must\nhave been what Judd called\nerasing his memories...
ACR_8_01587	And because of that, Ryan died...
ACR_8_01588	Mom must have come here to\nreturn it.
ACR_8_01589	That's why she was here 13\nyears ago.
ACR_8_01590	There's a cherry blossom design at the top\nof the gravestone.
ACR_8_01591	What's this?
ACR_8_01592	Stone tiles engraved with letters are lined up\non the gravestone.
ACR_8_01593	What's this say?
ACR_8_01594	Born an angel, you make me whole.
ACR_8_01595	Gone too soon, you leave me hollow.
ACR_8_01596	Judd dedicated this message\nto his son.
ACR_8_01597	Huh?
ACR_8_01598	What's up?
ACR_8_01599	It looks like there's some sort of\ntrick to this gravestone...
ACR_8_01600	Are the stone tiles some\nsort of key?
ACR_8_01601	A key?
ACR_8_01602	It opened!
ACR_8_01603	Dad, check it out.
ACR_8_01604	There's a picture inside.
ACR_8_01605	Look at his smile.
ACR_8_01606	He looks so happy.
ACR_8_01607	I never would have guessed.\nJudd stole Sayoko's memories,\nand yet...
ACR_8_01608	What he cherished the most was\nthe memory of his child.
ACR_8_01609	Dad?
ACR_8_01610	Hello, Ashley.
ACR_8_01611	Ryan!
ACR_8_01612	You still remember me.
ACR_8_01613	Of course I do.
ACR_8_01614	When you and I met in\nthe ANOTHER room...
ACR_8_01615	I attempted to delete the memory\ndata you have of me.
ACR_8_01616	But it seems I never gained full\naccess to your hippocampus.
ACR_8_01617	What did you do to my dad?
ACR_8_01618	I have suspended his\nconsciousness.
ACR_8_01619	It is only temporary. He will\nnot perish.
ACR_8_01620	He is not required for our\ncurrent discourse.
ACR_8_01621	I think I finally understand, Ryan.
ACR_8_01622	You used the ANOTHER through\nsecurity cameras.
ACR_8_01623	It's how you made me see you.
ACR_8_01624	That's correct. What you see\nright now is only in your mind.
ACR_8_01625	This image is temporarily\ningrained in your memory.
ACR_8_01626	I am currently manipulating\nyour perception.
ACR_8_01627	You took advantage of Sofia\nin the same way.
ACR_8_01628	But I'm not like her.
ACR_8_01629	I won't let you do whatever\nyou want.
ACR_8_01630	Interesting.
ACR_8_01631	Sayoko said the same thing\nto Judd.
ACR_8_01632	Your life's work is to complete the ANOTHER.
ACR_8_01633	I will not allow you to\nsquander your brilliance.
ACR_8_01634	Especially for something as\nfoolish as family. I forbid it.
ACR_8_01635	Get back to work this instant!
ACR_8_01636	That's an order!
ACR_8_01637	The ANOTHER is more than\nyour precious research.
ACR_8_01638	I will not allow myself to be used.
ACR_8_01639	Your eyes look so much like\nSayoko's did back then.
ACR_8_01640	Ashley, why are you here?
ACR_8_01641	I don't understand.
ACR_8_01642	I thought coming here would help\nme figure everything out.
ACR_8_01643	What do you mean\nby everything?
ACR_8_01644	My mom came to this island\n13 years ago.
ACR_8_01645	I thought if I could remember\nthat moment, it would all fall\ninto place.
ACR_8_01646	I would understand why she came\nto Lake Juliet.
ACR_8_01647	Why the memory of my mother\nknew about you.
ACR_8_01648	Why you appeared to me...
ACR_8_01649	and tried to revive her.
ACR_8_01650	I see.
ACR_8_01651	I want to know.
ACR_8_01652	I want to know the truth\nabout you.
ACR_8_01653	A drive for knowledge.
ACR_8_01654	I have always felt that too.
ACR_8_01655	Why was I born? What is\nmy purpose?
ACR_8_01656	What are you talking about?
ACR_8_01657	I've never encountered someone\nlike you.
ACR_8_01658	Someone who wished to know me.
ACR_8_01659	I understand. I will tell you\nthe truth.
ACR_8_02070	Here lies Ryan Fitzgerald.
ACR_8_02071	And because he existed, I\nnow exist.
ACR_8_02072	Judd's son.
ACR_8_02073	The ANOTHER's first\never test subject.
ACR_8_02074	Ryan lost his mother\nat a young age.
ACR_8_02075	This left a deep wound on his\nheart. He closed himself off, no\nlonger allowing himself to feel.
ACR_8_02076	Judd wanted to heal that\nwound, thereby restoring\nhis son's emotions.
ACR_8_02077	He attempted to do this with the\nANOTHER, which was still just\na prototype at the time.
ACR_8_02078	However, the experiment failed.
ACR_8_02079	Ryan was left paralyzed,\nand later died.
ACR_8_02080	Ryan's memories were extracted\nduring that experiment.
ACR_8_02081	They were recorded to\nliquid memory...
ACR_8_02082	and stored in a tank in J.C.\nValley's basement storage.
ACR_8_02083	And that tank, containing\nliquid memory...
ACR_8_02084	is where I was born.
ACR_8_02085	The first human to notice...
ACR_8_02086	was your mother.
ACR_8_02087	There's no mistaking.
ACR_8_02088	The stored memory data is changing.
ACR_8_02089	The liquid memory is producing new\nepisodic recollections on its own?
ACR_8_02090	I don't know how it happened.
ACR_8_02091	Sayoko referred to me as...
ACR_8_02092	A "conscious life-form" born\nfrom Ryan's memory data.
ACR_8_02093	Born from memory data?
ACR_8_02094	The first thing I remember is the\nfeeling of swimming through a\nsea of memories.
ACR_8_02095	The human memory is truly\na fascinating thing.
ACR_8_02096	It starts with sense, and then\nthere is information. And\nbeyond that, knowledge.
ACR_8_02097	Each memory has a\ndifferent emotion.
ACR_8_02098	Longing, loneliness, fear...\nRegret, happiness...
ACR_8_02099	I am proof that Ryan was alive.\nI read his memory and I learned.
ACR_8_02100	And I slowly grew.
ACR_8_02101	My mom never told Judd\nabout you?
ACR_8_02102	She reported her findings, but\nJudd quickly dismissed them.
ACR_8_02103	He said that self-propagation\nof memory data is impossible.
ACR_8_02104	He was exactly the person Ryan's\nmemory made him out to be.
ACR_8_02105	A genius scientist willing to do\nanything to further his research.\nEven sacrifice his own family.
ACR_8_02106	Self-righteous, refusing to hear\nanyone else's opinion.
ACR_8_02107	Unlike Sayoko, he never tried\nto understand me.
ACR_8_02109	Once she left, Judd would glance\nat the tank every so often.
ACR_8_02110	And then one day, he started\ntalking to it. He said...
ACR_8_02111	I'll find a way to revive\nyou, Ryan.
ACR_8_02112	He continued developing\nthe ANOTHER alone.
ACR_8_02113	He also started a new\nexperiment...
ACR_8_02114	An experiment to overwrite\nmemories using the ANOTHER.
ACR_8_02115	Judd began writing Ryan's\nmemory data onto other\nsubjects.
ACR_8_02116	It was his attempt to revive\nhis son.
ACR_8_02117	Carrying out these experiments\nrequired him to create many\ncopies of Ryan's data.
ACR_8_02118	He extracted his test\nsubjects' memories...
ACR_8_02119	and accumulated them all into\nliquid memory.
ACR_8_02120	Was his experiment successful?
ACR_8_02121	It was not.
ACR_8_02122	It was impossible to complete\nthe ANOTHER without Sayoko.
ACR_8_02123	The ability to overwrite memory\nnever came to fruition.
ACR_8_02124	He abandoned its development\nand sealed up the lab housing\nthe ANOTHER.
ACR_8_02125	And then, six years ago...
ACR_8_02126	A terrible storm tore\nthrough Lake Juliet.
ACR_8_02127	J.C. Valley lost power and the\nbuilding was destroyed.
ACR_8_02128	The tanks storing liquid\nmemory were damaged.
ACR_8_02129	They leaked into the lake.
ACR_8_02130	This was liquid memory that\ncontained not only Ryan's\nmemories but many others'.
ACR_8_02131	It became one with the water.
ACR_8_02132	So in a way, it felt like this lake\nhad become my brain.
ACR_8_02133	Over time, I was able to access\nJ.C. Valley's network.
ACR_8_02134	This, in turn, allowed me access\nto all sorts of information.
ACR_8_01660	That's when I learned of\nSayoko's murder.
ACR_8_01661	I learned a lot from Judd's\ncomputer.
ACR_8_01662	Including that it was Bill who\nkilled Sayoko.
ACR_8_01663	And that whoever he was\nworking for was connected\nto Judd.
ACR_8_01664	What?
ACR_8_01665	How could you?!
ACR_8_01666	Why did you murder Sayoko?!
ACR_8_01667	From the very start, the\nANOTHER project...
ACR_8_01668	was conducted in secret.
ACR_8_01669	Sayoko and I were handpicked by the lab's\nhead to carry the project forward.
ACR_8_01670	You were just a researcher...\nA useful tool.
ACR_8_01671	We started making...
ACR_8_01672	real progress.
ACR_8_01673	But then Sayoko...
ACR_8_01674	betrayed us.
ACR_8_01675	You two stole our research,\nhid it in your home.
ACR_8_01676	So I gave Sayoko one\nmore chance that night.
ACR_8_01677	I told her to return the research...
ACR_8_01678	and return to the fold.
ACR_8_01679	I see...
ACR_8_01680	So if Mom knew all this...
ACR_8_01681	Is that why she tried to\nprotect the ANOTHER?
ACR_8_01682	Ashley...
ACR_8_01683	It wasn't until I learned of\nSayoko's death that I\nfinally understood...
ACR_8_01684	the sorts of moments that can\nproduce such strong emotions.
ACR_8_01685	I had never felt more.
ACR_8_01686	And yet, at that moment,\nall I felt...
ACR_8_01687	was sadness.
ACR_8_01688	And all I wanted was to\nask Judd...
ACR_8_01689	why did Sayoko have to die?
ACR_8_01690	Did you ever meet Judd?
ACR_8_01691	I did.
ACR_8_01692	He was in the process of\ndeveloping the remote\nANOTHER at the time.
ACR_8_01693	I infiltrated the system to gain\naccess to him.
ACR_8_01694	What are you?
ACR_8_01695	Judd looked both surprised and\nconfused when I appeared\nbefore him.
ACR_8_01696	He reached out to see if I was\nreal, but he couldn't touch me.
ACR_8_01697	So he simply stared at\nme for a long while.
ACR_8_01698	And then I asked him...
ACR_8_01699	Why did Sayoko have to die?
ACR_8_01700	He remained silent. He simply\nlooked at me with an expression\nI couldn't interpret.
ACR_8_01701	So I asked him once more...
ACR_8_01702	Why did Sayoko, the only person\nwho knew me, have to die?
ACR_8_01703	He didn't answer my question.\nInstead, he muttered my name.
ACR_8_01704	Ryan...
ACR_8_01705	At last, he understood the\nnature of my existence.
ACR_8_01706	He looked at me with eyes that\nhad grown old, and he trembled.
ACR_8_01707	What emotion do you suppose he\nwas expressing?
ACR_8_01708	Judd died, right?
ACR_8_01709	After learning about you?
ACR_8_01710	Yes. Both Sayoko and Judd\nwere gone.
ACR_8_01711	So no one else in the world knew\nof my existence.
ACR_8_01712	And yet, I continued to exist in\nthis lake.
ACR_8_01713	That sounds so lonely.
ACR_8_01714	All this time, my mind was\noccupied with a single thought...
ACR_8_01715	Why do I exist? But I couldn't\nfind an answer.
ACR_8_01716	After a while, I grew interested\nin the ANOTHER left behind by\nSayoko and Judd.
ACR_8_01717	I wanted to complete it.
ACR_8_01718	I was the one Bill sent the\nANOTHER's source code to.
ACR_8_01719	No way...
ACR_8_01720	Using that data, I was able to\ncomplete...
ACR_8_01721	the prototype ANOTHER.
ACR_8_01722	But why?
ACR_8_01723	It was simply a task to prove\nI exist.
ACR_8_01724	I didn't have a specific goal\nbeyond that.
ACR_8_01725	Dr. Robins came to J.C. Valley.
ACR_8_01726	He started investigating things\nno one had looked into before.
ACR_8_01727	Do you know why he came here?
ACR_8_01728	Did he tell you?
ACR_8_01729	I didn't know at first...\nBut I do now.
ACR_8_01730	I need to find out...
ACR_8_01731	why she was here.
ACR_8_01732	Because if I do...
ACR_8_01733	I think it will reveal...
ACR_8_01734	the truth behind her death.
ACR_8_01735	My dad wanted to know why my\nmom came here.
ACR_8_01736	Ryan, we had no idea...
ACR_8_01737	We didn't know her memory data\nwas inside her pendant.
ACR_8_01738	I see.
ACR_8_01739	But how did you know?
ACR_8_01740	How did you know about\nthe pendant?
ACR_8_01741	I was monitoring Rex's computer.
ACR_8_01742	He kept a journal on it.
ACR_8_01743	He wrote about hiring\nyour father.
ACR_8_01744	He wrote, "Should I tell Richard\nabout Sayoko's pendant?"
ACR_8_01745	When Dr. Robins came to\nJ.C. Valley...
ACR_8_01746	he was still seeking the truth of\nwhat happened to Sayoko.
ACR_8_01747	He found the data that Bill\nhad sent.
ACR_8_01748	That's when he started piecing\ntogether the secrets around the\nANOTHER and the secret lab.
ACR_8_01749	He began looking into the lake\npollution too.
ACR_8_01750	He was close to figuring out that\nthe pollution was liquid memory.
ACR_8_01751	It was around then I started to\nfeel cornered.
ACR_8_01752	After all, the substance polluting\nthe lake is me.
ACR_8_01753	I don't have much time left.
ACR_8_01754	I've come to understand this.
ACR_8_01755	If the lake is purified, cleansing\nitself of the liquid memory...
ACR_8_01756	I will disappear.
ACR_8_01757	In other words...
ACR_8_02211	I will die.
ACR_8_01758	Oh no...
ACR_8_01759	That's when Dr. Robins invited\nyou here.
ACR_8_01760	When you arrived at\nthe campsite...
ACR_8_01761	you were wearing\nSayoko's pendant.
ACR_8_01762	I wanted to see her.
ACR_8_01763	Just one last time.
ACR_8_01764	That pendant contains memories\nof Sayoko.
ACR_8_01765	And I'm sure they remember me.
ACR_8_01766	That's why I tried to use\nthe ANOTHER and you.\nSayoko's daughter.
ACR_8_01767	I wanted to revive her.
ACR_8_01768	But the RAS was her way of\npreventing that.
ACR_8_01769	She showed me the error\nof my ways.
ACR_8_01770	Using the ANOTHER to prove my\nexistence was wrong.
ACR_8_01771	I know that now.
ACR_8_01772	That's it.
ACR_8_01773	That's everything.
ACR_8_01774	I wanted you to know.
ACR_8_01775	This is my truth.
ACR_8_01776	Um, Ryan?
ACR_8_01777	What's happening to you?
ACR_8_01778	Wait, are you trying to erase my\nmemories of you?!
ACR_8_01779	You...
ACR_8_01780	will forget me.
ACR_8_01781	No, Ryan!
ACR_8_01782	That's...
ACR_8_01783	Ryan, look! Look at this!
ACR_8_01784	Remember you...
ACR_8_01785	It's a message from my mom!
ACR_8_01786	When you tried to write my mom's\nmemories onto me...
ACR_8_01788	She told me something.
ACR_8_01789	She said a person can live\nforever as long as someone\nremembers them!
ACR_8_01791	Sayoko...
ACR_8_01792	Thank you, Ryan.
ACR_8_01793	Because you remember her...
ACR_8_01794	my mom lives on.
ACR_8_01795	And thanks to that, I got to\nsee her.
ACR_8_02194	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_01796	Ashley...
ACR_8_01797	Will you remember me?
ACR_8_01798	Even if I disappear?
ACR_8_01799	Yes.
ACR_8_01800	I won't forget the person Mom discovered.
ACR_8_01801	I'll remember you forever.
ACR_8_01802	Please... Show me the RAS again...
ACR_8_02195	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_01803	Thank you, Sayoko.
ACR_8_01804	I can finally be at peace.
ACR_8_02196	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_02197	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_01805	Ashley?
ACR_8_01806	Dad... Ryan disappeared...
ACR_8_01807	He touched the RAS, and...now he's gone.
ACR_8_01808	What?
ACR_8_01809	He told me about Mom.
ACR_8_01810	And why he appeared to me.
ACR_8_02193	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_01811	What did he say?
ACR_8_01812	Tell me everything.
ACR_8_01813	After that, Dad and I took the\nboat back to J.C. Valley.
ACR_8_01814	He took me to his lab, and...
ACR_8_02212	I took a nap on his cot.
ACR_8_01815	He and Rex had a long conversation.
ACR_8_01816	Dad was with me when I woke up.\nHe told me it's time to go home.
ACR_8_01817	We didn't talk much on the\nwalk back to the cottage.
ACR_8_01818	We didn't need to tell each other what\nwe were thinking. We just knew.
ACR_8_02213	We were thinking about Mom.
ACR_8_01819	Honestly, you two...
ACR_8_01820	I had a funny feeling after our\nphone call yesterday.
ACR_8_01821	I got worried, so I came to make\nsure everything was all right.
ACR_8_01822	Only to find you two\nwere out all night?!
ACR_8_01823	Well, it's just that, um, so much\nhappened, and...
ACR_8_01824	For real, Jessica! It was a lot.
ACR_8_01825	Well? Go on.
ACR_8_01826	It's all my fault. I got Ashley\nmixed up in a big mess.
ACR_8_01827	Don't listen to him!
ACR_8_01828	It was my idea to go to\nthat island!
ACR_8_01829	...
ACR_8_01830	Dad kept me safe, Jessica.
ACR_8_01831	And it's all thanks to Ashley that\nwe learned about Sayoko.
ACR_8_01832	At least you two are\ngetting along.
ACR_8_01833	Huh?
ACR_8_01834	Aren't you glad you agreed\nto the trip?
ACR_8_01835	Yeah. Actually.
ACR_8_01836	I have so much to tell\nyou, Jessica.
ACR_8_01837	I can't wait to hear it all.
ACR_8_01838	When does the bus home arrive?
ACR_8_01839	We still have a little time. I'm\ngonna go say bye to everyone.
ACR_8_00953	Oh! One more thing.
ACR_8_00954	Can you return the key\ncard to the guesthouse?
ACR_8_00955	I've already checked us out.
ACR_8_00956	Sure thing.
ACR_8_00957	There weren't any extra\ncharges, so it was quick.
ACR_8_00958	Maybe I should grab some sodas?
ACR_8_00959	But there were drinks at\nthe campsite.
ACR_8_00960	Were there?
ACR_8_00961	If I want a souvenir, I'll ask you\nto pick it up later.
ACR_8_00962	It'll give you a reason to\ncome home.
ACR_8_00963	I'm on it.
ACR_8_00965	Oh! One more thing.
ACR_8_00966	Can you return the key\ncard to the guesthouse?
ACR_8_00967	I've already checked us out.
ACR_8_00968	Sure thing.
ACR_8_00969	I saw you picked up\nsome souvenirs.
ACR_8_00970	Just a few things.
ACR_8_00971	Sorry I didn't ask first.
ACR_8_00972	No, it's all right. I'm glad you\ngot something.
ACR_8_00973	If you want anything else from\nLake Juliet, just let me know.
ACR_8_00974	Will do. Thanks, Dad.
ACR_8_00976	Oh! One more thing.
ACR_8_00977	Can you return the key\ncard to the guesthouse?
ACR_8_00978	I've already checked us out.
ACR_8_00979	Sure thing.
ACR_8_00980	I see you bought quite a\nfew souvenirs.
ACR_8_00981	Oh, um, yeah. They...had a lot of\ncool stuff.
ACR_8_00982	Did I...buy too much?
ACR_8_00983	Nah. It's all right to\nsplurge sometimes.
ACR_8_00984	Just, um... Ask first next time?
ACR_8_00985	Will do.
ACR_8_00988	Oh! One more thing.
ACR_8_00989	Can you return the key\ncard to the guesthouse?
ACR_8_00990	I've already checked us out.
ACR_8_00991	Sure thing.
ACR_8_00992	So, um... It looks like you...bought\na ton of souvenirs, huh?
ACR_8_00993	Yeah! They had some really\ncool stuff.
ACR_8_00994	I really feel like I bonded with\nLake Juliet, ya know?
ACR_8_00995	Everything just felt so special\nto me.
ACR_8_00996	Oh, uh, yeah. That's good to hear.
ACR_8_00998	Dad, check this out!
ACR_8_01000	That looks familiar...
ACR_8_01001	Remember the keychain with the\ngate key to the Edward mansion?
ACR_8_01002	That takes me back.
ACR_8_01003	This used to be the only kind of\nthing the guesthouse sold.
ACR_8_01004	Looks like they've expanded\ntheir options.
ACR_8_01005	What do you think of\nthe mascots?
ACR_8_01006	I think they're pretty\ncharming, actually.
ACR_8_01007	Then you get one too! We\ncan match!
ACR_8_01008	That's a good idea. I'll pick\none up.
ACR_8_01840	Stay safe, Ashley.
ACR_8_01841	I'll be home on the weekends.\nI'll see you then.
ACR_8_01010	Well if it isn't Miss Ashley!
ACR_8_01011	Hi, Bob. I'm on my way home.
ACR_8_01012	Aw, what a shame. Safe travels.
ACR_8_01013	And don't be a stranger,\nya hear?
ACR_8_01014	Oh, I'm definitely stopping by\nwhenever I visit my dad.
ACR_8_01015	Lookin' forward to it!
ACR_8_01016	Your friends will miss you, but\nthe Salmon Rice Burger will miss\nyou even more.
ACR_8_01017	I'll be dreaming of that burger.
ACR_8_01018	And I'll make sure the tab\ngoes to...
ACR_8_01019	My dad!
ACR_8_01020	To Doc Robins, it is!
ACR_8_01842	Hi, Ashley.
ACR_8_01023	Are you heading home?
ACR_8_01024	Yeah. Thanks for everything.
ACR_8_01025	No, I should be thanking you.
ACR_8_01026	I've got my work cut out for\nme. First we need to seal up\nthe files on the ANOTHER\nand clean the lake.
ACR_8_01027	And of course we'll compensate\nthe community for the pollution.
ACR_8_01028	I imagine there's more paperwork\nthan research on the horizon.
ACR_8_01029	Sounds tough.
ACR_8_01030	Hehe... All in a day's work for\na director.
ACR_8_01031	One more thing... I'm sorry to\nkeep your father here.
ACR_8_01032	We'll need him to help rebuild\nJ.C. Valley.
ACR_8_01033	I get it.
ACR_8_01034	I'll cheer him on while he does\nwhat he does best.
ACR_8_01035	I'm sure that's what Mom would\nhave wanted.
ACR_8_01036	Just take care of him. OK?
ACR_8_01037	Thank you, Ashley.
ACR_8_01038	Oh, and I hear you and Elizabeth\nhave started getting along.
ACR_8_01843	Thanks for that too.
ACR_8_01844	It's too bad she isn't here to\nsay goodbye.
ACR_8_01845	I wonder where she is...
ACR_8_01846	Hmm... I think Janet's hanging\nout at Bob's place, but...
ACR_8_01847	Well, at any rate, take care of\nyourself. Come and visit anytime.
ACR_8_01848	I'll be back, for sure!
ACR_8_01041	Heeeey! What's up?
ACR_8_01042	I'm about to catch my bus home.
ACR_8_01043	Whaaat? No way! I was looking\nforward to hanging out.
ACR_8_01044	I guess you'll just have to\ncome back soon.
ACR_8_01045	I definitely will.
ACR_8_01046	Elizabeth said she's gonna\ncome back to practice.
ACR_8_01047	That's great!
ACR_8_01048	I didn't think Tommy or I got\nthrough to her, but then...boom!\nMind changed.
ACR_8_01049	Don't suppose you had anything\nto do with that?
ACR_8_01050	Nah. Not really.
ACR_8_01051	I just cleared the air a little. And\nI think we may be friends now?
ACR_8_01052	Friends with Miss Moody?\nImpressive!
ACR_8_01053	Which means I must be pretty\nimpressive too, huh?
ACR_8_01054	Yeah, I think so.
ACR_8_01055	Ha, all right! Byyye!
ACR_8_01056	See ya!
ACR_8_01058	Last time I was here...
ACR_8_01059	Hold it right there!
ACR_8_01062	Charlotte!
ACR_8_01849	Did you find Matthew?
ACR_8_01850	Yeah.
ACR_8_01851	He remembered everything.
ACR_8_01852	He figured out where his dad is,\ntoo, so he went to see him.
ACR_8_01853	Is that so? I'm glad.
ACR_8_01854	It seems this meddlesome young\nlady was helpful after all.
ACR_8_01855	Aw, harsh! Here I thought you\nmight be about to thank me.
ACR_8_01856	You're sure in a good mood.
ACR_8_01857	Did something happen?
ACR_8_01858	Huh?
ACR_8_01859	Oh, nothing major.
ACR_8_01860	I'm just going to have a visitor\nsoon, is all.
ACR_8_01861	Oh! Who's coming?
ACR_8_01862	I called my daughter and she\nstarted crying on the phone,\npoor thing. She's visiting today.
ACR_8_01863	Honestly, shouldn't she have just\ntold me before running off\nand eloping?
ACR_8_01864	Aw, come on, Charlotte. Just be\nhappy to see your daughter!
ACR_8_01865	You're about to meet your\ngrandchild for the first time.
ACR_8_01866	Did you say something, dear?
ACR_8_01867	No, nothing.
ACR_8_01868	I'm heading home after this.
ACR_8_01869	Oh, I see!
ACR_8_01870	My garden will be thankful for\nthe reduced foot traffic.
ACR_8_01871	Are you sure you aren't actually\nsad? Maybe even just a little?
ACR_8_01872	Visit Lake Juliet again,\nOK, Ashley?
ACR_8_01873	I'll be back for sure, Charlotte.\nTake care.
ACR_8_01087	Hey there, Ashley!
ACR_8_01088	Hi Dan!
ACR_8_01089	Ah, you've always got a cheerful\ngreeting for me.
ACR_8_01090	I'm just about to head home.
ACR_8_01091	Oh, I see!
ACR_8_01092	I'm sorry I couldn't track down\nyour bag.
ACR_8_01093	Oh! I should have told you.
ACR_8_01094	I actually found it.
ACR_8_01095	Did you, now?
ACR_8_01096	Well that's good news!
ACR_8_01874	By the way... About that runaway.
ACR_8_01097	You mean Matthew? Oh, that's\nall taken care of.
ACR_8_01098	His uncle got in touch with me.
ACR_8_01099	Sounds like Matthew made it to\nhis dad, safe and sound.
ACR_8_01102	That's great news!
ACR_8_01103	Your efforts really helped save\nhim, Ashley. Thank you.
ACR_8_01104	Aw, geez... I don't know.
ACR_8_01105	You know, there's something I'd\nlike you to consider...
ACR_8_01875	Have you ever thought about\nbecoming a forest ranger?\nYou're a natural protector!
ACR_8_01876	What?
ACR_8_01877	I'll, uh... I'll give it some thought\nlater, OK?
ACR_8_01878	I'll be waiting to hear back!
ACR_8_01879	See you later.
ACR_8_01880	Hey, Gina!
ACR_8_01881	Oh, Ashley!
ACR_8_01882	I was out for my first stroll in a\nwhile, hoping I'd run into you\nbefore you headed home.
ACR_8_01883	The director told me about the\nremote ANOTHER.
ACR_8_01884	Yeah... Crazy, huh?
ACR_8_01885	So much has happened. You must\nbe exhausted.
ACR_8_01886	Nah, I'm fine. But what about\nyou? Are your injuries all right?
ACR_8_01887	Oh, that was nothing major. I'm\nstronger than I look, you know.
ACR_8_01888	I had a feeling.
ACR_8_01889	Haha.
ACR_8_01890	Thanks, Gina.
ACR_8_01891	I was able to hang on because\nyou were there with me.
ACR_8_01892	Come hang out again soon, OK?
ACR_8_01893	I'll be here, enjoying the view.\nAnd working with the director\nand Dr. Robins, of course...
ACR_8_01894	We're going to continue our\nresearch in ways that will really\nhelp people.
ACR_8_01895	Take care of my dad for me.
ACR_8_01896	Leave him to me.
ACR_8_01897	I'll see you next time. Tell Ian I\nsaid bye too.
ACR_8_01898	You got it. Take care, Ashley.
ACR_8_01120	Going somewhere, Ashley?
ACR_8_01121	Yeah, the bus stop.\nI'm heading home.
ACR_8_01122	Already? That's too bad.
ACR_8_01123	I heard things got crazy\nat J.C. Valley.
ACR_8_01124	My dad told me about it.
ACR_8_01125	Yeah, things got a little crazy...
ACR_8_01126	I heard about Sofia too.
ACR_8_01127	It was hard for Dad to talk about,\nbut he told me everything.
ACR_8_01128	I'm glad you talked with him.
ACR_8_01129	How are things with your dad?
ACR_8_01130	Better. I mean, there's still a lot\nI don't get, but...better.
ACR_8_01131	Dads. Right?
ACR_8_01133	One other thing. I'm sorry for\nbeing so rude to Matthew.
ACR_8_01134	I didn't know the truth, and I said\nsome pretty mean things.
ACR_8_01135	If it's bothering you, why don't\nyou send him a message?
ACR_8_01136	I'm sure Dan has his contact info.
ACR_8_01137	Yeah, good idea. Honesty is the\nway to go, right?
ACR_8_01138	Yeah. And text me while\nyou're at it.
ACR_8_01139	Oh, please. As if I'd ever do that.
ACR_8_01140	What?!
ACR_8_01141	I'll just have to see you at the\nband contest!
ACR_8_01142	Ha. I guess you're right.
ACR_8_01144	I have a song that only\nI can sing.
ACR_8_01146	I can't wait!
ACR_8_01147	Then I'll see you there. Later.
ACR_8_01148	You bet!
ACR_8_01151	Be good to Elizabeth, OK?
ACR_8_01152	Woof!
ACR_8_01154	No slacking off today, right?
ACR_8_01155	Hey now. No one works\nharder than me.
ACR_8_01156	That's your line, huh?
ACR_8_01157	Your dad already checked out.
ACR_8_01158	Now I just need the key card.
ACR_8_01159	Here you go.
ACR_8_01160	Seems like you had a pretty\neventful vacation.
ACR_8_01161	Not wrong. But I think it'll be\na good memory.
ACR_8_01162	Glad to hear it.
ACR_8_01163	At the end of the day, I really\nlike this place.
ACR_8_01164	I'm glad what went down didn't\nruin it for you.
ACR_8_01165	You're not so bad, Tommy.
ACR_8_01166	Just figuring that out?
ACR_8_01168	Once you return the key card,\nyou won't be able to get back in.
ACR_8_01169	Have you said all your goodbyes?
ACR_8_01171	Yep. All done.
ACR_8_01173	Then there you are.
ACR_8_01174	Officially checked out.
ACR_8_01175	Thanks for everything.
ACR_8_01176	No worries.
ACR_8_01177	Key card returned to Tommy.
ACR_8_01179	Thanks for reminding me.\nI'm not quite done.
ACR_8_01180	Then you better get at it!
ACR_8_01181	You still have some time before\nthe bus gets here.
ACR_8_01182	Thanks.
ACR_8_01184	Ashley!
ACR_8_01186	Keep on rockin'.
ACR_8_01187	I'll see you at the band contest.
ACR_8_01188	See ya there!
ACR_8_01228	*exhale*
ACR_8_02198	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_02199	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_02210	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_02200	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_02201	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_02202	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_02203	(Exert Noise)
ACR_8_01197	The day before my 14th birthday\nstarted off pretty bad.
ACR_8_01198	But on that day, I reunited with my dad.
ACR_8_01199	And the rest became a\nmemory I'll never forget.
ACR_8_01200	Two years passed. I turned 16.
ACR_8_01201	I went to see Dad, and the\ntrip started off pretty bad...
ACR_8_01202	So much happened in just a single day...
ACR_8_01203	But it became another precious memory.
ACR_8_01204	I finally understand who my mom really was.
ACR_8_01205	I'll keep those two days close to my heart.
ACR_8_01207	Behind the door to my memories,\nwith Mom... Forever.
ACR_Mystery_8_2_00001	OK, Ashley...
ACR_Mystery_8_2_00002	Erase my memories that are\nintermingling with yours.
ACR_Mystery_8_2_00003	That's your memory. Try to relax.
ACR_Mystery_8_2_00004	I know you can do it, Ashley.
ACR_Mystery_8_2_00005	Now, erase all of my memories.
ACR_Mystery_8_2_00006	Ashley, that's your memory.
ACR_Mystery_8_2_00007	Yes, this is my memory. It's of my\nwork at J.C. Valley.
ACR_Mystery_8_2_00034	This is one of my memories. When\nI was pregnant with you.
ACR_Mystery_8_2_00045	This is one of my memories. It's\nthe day you were born.
ACR_Mystery_8_2_00056	Ashley, concentrate on what\nyou saw.
ACR_Mystery_8_2_00057	Don't erase your own memories.
ACR_Mystery_8_2_00063	Just a little more, Ashley. Just\na little bit more.
ACR_Mystery_8_2_00065	Ashley, just one more.
ACR_Mystery_8_2_00064	Now...delete my last remaining\nmemory.
ACR_Mystery_8_2_00066	...Mom.
ACR_Mystery_8_5_00001	There's a cherry-blossom design at the top of\nthe grave.
ACR_Mystery_8_5_00002	The following is engraved into the stone:
ACR_Mystery_8_5_00025	Ryan Fitzgerald\n　1980 - 1992
ACR_Mystery_8_5_00006	There are stone tiles engraved with letters.
ACR_Mystery_8_5_00010	If I can figure out how this\nworks, I should be able to\nfigure out what Judd left.
ACR_Mystery_8_5_00011	I knew there was some\nmechanism to it.
ACR_Mystery_8_5_00012	The tiles reset after four\npresses, so I have to be careful.
ACR_Mystery_8_5_00026	There must be a key word.
ACR_Mystery_8_5_00013	No good. That's not the\nright word.
ACR_Mystery_8_5_00017	The design changes\nwhen rotated.
ACR_Mystery_8_5_00018	This cherry-blossom design was\non the grave too.
ACR_Mystery_8_5_00028	This pattern makes a word!
ACR_Mystery_8_5_00029	The word in this pattern is...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r1are_00012	Wow. Lake Juliet sure\nis impressive.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r1are_00013	Welcome to Lake Juliet
ACR_Obj_flavor_r1are_00014	Oh, yeah—I remember being in a\npretty bad mood the first time\nI walked down this path...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r1are_00015	Who would've guessed I wouldn't\nwant to go home?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r1are_00016	Guess I'll just have to start\nplanning my next trip to visit\neveryone again!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r1are_00017	Welcome to Lake Juliet
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00038	Helmet, battery, camp stove,\nflashlight...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00039	I guess this is a supply shelf?\nDoesn't seem like anyone's\nusing this stuff right now.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00040	I don't think I need anything\nelse on this shelf.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00041	The shelf is filled with camping supplies that\naren't currently in use.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00042	Whoa—anyone could step on this\nbroken glass!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00043	Shards of broken glass are scattered on\nthe floor.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00044	Huh? This sign says "Keep Out."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00045	People aren't allowed in here?\nAm I going to get in trouble?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00046	There is a sign on the ground that reads\n"Keep Out" in large letters.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00047	What's all this junk?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00048	It's got wheels... Is that an\nold rail cart?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00049	There's something on the floor that looks like\nan old rail cart that's missing two wheels.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00050	Yeah, this thing is a rusty mess.\nMost of the paint's peeled\noff too.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00051	A rusty wheelbarrow with peeling paint is\nleaning against the wall.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00052	Why is there so much trash here?\nChip bags, plastic bottles...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00053	Oh, this is the same kind of jerky\nthey had at the guesthouse.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00054	Discarded snack bags and empty bottles are\nscattered on the floor.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00055	Are these car tires? What are\nthey doing here?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00056	What's this shed for?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00057	There's a pile of old tires.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00058	A plastic container fell over.\nGood thing they all seem to\nbe empty.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00059	It would be dangerous if they\nwere full of gas or something.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00060	Empty plastic containers are scattered around.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00061	These planks are painted the\nsame color as the wall.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00062	Were they extras they didn't end\nup using? Or spares in case they\nneed to repair something?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2ahi_00063	There are wooden planks painted the same\ncolor as the building that have fallen down.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00078	I've been on my feet a long time.\nMaybe I'll take a break here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00079	No, I should just go get bus fare\nfrom Dad and get home ASAP.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00080	It's a bench in a pleasant spot,\nperfect for weary travelers to\nrest a bit.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00081	There's a bench beside the path that must get\na lot of sun.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00082	I guess this table is for guests\nto use?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00083	I don't need it right now though.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00084	It might be fun to have a picnic\nin a spot like this sometime.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00085	...but right now I've got stuff to\ndo. No time for picnics.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00086	There's a wooden table for four that looks\nperfect for a family picnic.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00087	I wish I'd gotten to eat here with\neveryone. We've all gotten so\nclose...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00088	Next time I come, I'll bring one\nof Jessica's special cakes to\neat here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00089	A log table with room for four.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00090	Is that picture on the flag the\nlogo for the campground?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00091	Seems like it's a really pretty\nlake, at least in the picture.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00092	There's a forest along the shore,\nand mountains off the in the\ndistance...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00093	This logo looks like it's the view\nfrom the place I just saw!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00094	A flag emblazoned with a picture of the lake.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00106	I'm a little surprised the mail\ncarrier gets out this far.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00107	There's a mailbox in front of the guesthouse.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00108	"Please take all garbage\nwith you when leaving."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00109	I guess some people just go home\nwithout cleaning up...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00110	Please take all garbage\nwith you when leaving.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00111	Please keep our lake beautiful!\n   -Your Forest Rangers
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00112	What are these giant logs for?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00113	There are some big logs stacked beside\nthe path.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00114	Hey, who left this can here?\nI should clean this up.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00118	It's pitch dark in here. He's a\nbrave kid to hide in here...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00119	I'd never be able to do that...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00120	The well is deep and dark enough that you\ncan't see the bottom.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00123	Why does this tree trunk have a\nrope tied to it?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00124	Maybe he's not the first to fall\nin this well?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00125	There's a rope tied to a tree trunk near\nthe well.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00126	Footprints and paw prints...\nLooks like a dog... Still wet.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00127	These are fresh.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00128	There are fresh footprints.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2are_00130	The hole in the fence is patched with\nyellow tape.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00073	Someone left this big hat behind.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00074	Most people can't pull off a hat\nlike this...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00075	Could this be Dad's? I can't really\nsee him in it, but...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00076	Someone left a brand-new wide-brimmed hat\nbehind on the hammock.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00077	I could use a nap, but I don't\nknow about this tent...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00078	No time for napping right now.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00079	There's a tent pitched in the shade of a tree.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00080	I like cookouts, but I'm not really\nin the mood right now.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00081	The grill doesn't have any charcoal in it yet.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00082	I lost track of time talking to\nRyan, so I missed out on the food.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00083	The scent of grilled meat lingers in the air.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00127	There's a little heat coming off the empty grill.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00084	I wonder if it's OK for me to\ndrink this...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00085	There are unopened plastic bottles lined up\non the table.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00086	I only saw it from the side while\nI was talking to Ryan...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00087	but that Ian guy was really\ngulping down this water.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00088	This bottle is opened and much of the contents\nhas already been drunk.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00089	Guess I'm really camping—got a\nnice tent and everything!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00090	Dad sure packed a lot... Guess\nhe was excited about this trip.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00091	Grilling paraphernalia is piled up in front of\nthe base tent.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00092	There's a gadget or something\non top of this pole. Is it for the\ncampground employees?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00093	There's a white pole with something at the\ntop near the campground entrance.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00094	There's a portable stove. I guess\nwe're not just grilling.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00095	What else is he gonna make?\nDoes Dad even know anything\nabout cooking?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00096	There's a portable stove on the table.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00097	What are they planning on\nmaking with this portable stove?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00098	Dad left, so I guess it's not\ngetting used.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00099	There's a portable stove on the table that was\nleft unused.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00100	That's a lot of food. They're all\nfull of meat and vegetables.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00101	The cooler and cardboard box are stuffed\nwith various ingredients.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00102	They're empty!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00103	Did everything in these\nget eaten?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00104	The large cooler and cardboard box are empty.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00105	This cooler's got drinks in it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00106	The cooler is full of drinks and ice.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00107	The ice in the cooler has all\nmelted.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00108	The cooler is flooded with melted ice.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00109	Someone's been cutting up\nvegetables, but they didn't finish.\nIs that gonna work?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00110	There are vegetables on the cutting board that\nare only partly cut up.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00111	Maybe I'll just wait here until the\ncookout's over...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00112	Is it rude to just sit here by\nmyself though?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00113	There's a bench at the corner of the campsite.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00114	These all have so many veggies...\nI'd prefer one with more meat\non it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00115	I'm not really in the mood to eat\nanything though.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00116	There are skewers on the plate, ready to\nbe cooked.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00117	These look well done and yummy!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00118	But this isn't the time to eat!\nI need to go hear what Dan\nhas to say.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00119	These skewers have been nicely grilled.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00120	I didn't get any meat. That's fine,\nI guess...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00121	There's nothing on the plate.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00122	Trash cans at campgrounds are\nusually overflowing.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00123	But this one's not bad. Must be\nthanks to Dan's patrolling.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00124	I should be sure to throw out any\nempty cans I have.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00125	No, wait—I can get tokens if I\nput them in the can recycler.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2cam_00126	There's a green trash can.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00137	I guess these bears are the\ncampground mascots.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00138	Ohhh—they're "Elle" and "Jay" for\n"Lake Juliet," aren't they?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00139	Large panels of the mascot characters\ndecorate this part of the room.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00142	I can't buy any souvenirs until\nTommy gets back. I'll come back\nlater.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00143	There's no one at the counter.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00144	Oh, this stereo is where the\nmusic's been coming from.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00145	This stereo is too fancy to be\nstuck playing just this song.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00146	Ugh. If I had to listen to this all\nday, it would probably haunt my\ndreams at night.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00147	Do they ever play another song?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00148	Anyone would get sick of having\nto listen to it all day.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00149	A stereo plays the campground theme song\non a continuous loop.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00150	This song gets stuck in your\nhead and just stays there.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00151	There's a red cord coming from the speaker in\nthe store.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00152	It's a poster for a boathouse.\nIs it somewhere at the\ncampground?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00153	Oh, it says "Temporarily Closed."\nWhy come out to a lake if you\ncan't even ride a boat?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00154	Ian mentioned a boathouse—is\nthis it?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00155	I guess he did say it was old, and\nthis place isn't operating\nanymore, so...maybe?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00156	It stinks that we can't take a\nboat ride. That's what lakes\nare for!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00157	The poster shows a parent and child fishing\nfrom a boat.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00158	I don't recognize the name of\nthis newspaper. I guess they must\nbe local.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00159	A newspaper has been discarded under the\ncoffee table.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00160	I could spend a whole day here,\njust chilling on that comfy sofa.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00161	Not sure how long I could listen\nto this theme song though...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00162	There's a comfortable-looking sofa here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00163	"Lake Juliet Zero-Trash\nProgram"?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00164	Hmm. "Recycle empty cans and\nget tokens!"
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00165	"Recycle empty cans and get\ntokens!" I like the sound of that.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00166	This plastic bottle is a little big\nto go walking around with.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00167	I'm probably better off buying a\ncan of juice or something.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00168	There are bottles of various sizes on the\nbottom shelf of the refrigerator.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00169	Looks like the T-shirts on this\nrack are all too big for me.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00170	There are T-shirts with bear characters on\nthem hanging here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00171	Are these, like, custom Lake\nJuliet posters?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00172	I wonder if they're the same as\nthe one on the wall.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00173	There are several posters rolled up in a\nbig can.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00174	They look like they're having fun\ncamping here. This would be a\ngood ad.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00175	This poster shows two bear characters\nhappily relaxing.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00176	I hope I get to grill with everyone\nagain. I think this time I would be\nable to relax and talk.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00177	Oh, and I'll have to invite\nMatthew as well!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00178	Is this an ad poster? Seems like\nI've seen this picture around.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00179	The poster on the wall shows the lake and\nsome bear characters.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00180	This shot of the mountain looks\nlike the view I saw from the bus.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00181	They must have taken the photo\nright around here, then.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00182	The corner of the photo is signed\n"Gilbert Moss."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00183	What kind of plant is this?\nI wonder if it ever blooms.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00184	The potted plant has fresh, green leaves\nspreading out wide.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00185	It's all full of gumballs, but I can't\nsee how to buy one.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00186	It doesn't seem like regular coins\nwould fit. Maybe you need a\nweird token or something?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00187	It's a gumball machine that does not accept\nnormal coins.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00193	Oh, there's the charcoal!\n...But now isn't the time.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00194	There's a paper bag on the\ntable filled with charcoal.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00198	It looks like the speaker is fine.\nCord's connected too.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00199	Nothing seems out of the ordinary about the\nspeaker or the cord.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00202	It looks like boxes filled with the\nstuff they sell in the store.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00203	There's a pile of cardboard boxes filled with\nthe store's souvenir inventory.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00204	He went through the fridge,\ntoo... Wonder what he's going\nto steal next?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00205	It's a large, commercial refrigerator.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00206	Lanterns, a portable stove,\nshovels... They've got everything\nyou could need, I guess.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00207	There are various camping tools\nlined up on the shelves.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00208	The coolers are empty. I wonder\nif they're for lending out\nto guests.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00209	Large coolers are stacked\nin the corner of the room.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00213	The box is filled with additional potato-chip\ninventory.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00219	Who filled a paper plate with\nwater and just left it here?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00220	Oh, is this for that dog I saw?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00223	There is a paper plate on the ground with\nwater in it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00224	If he just did his job, I wouldn't\nhave had to resort to that.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00225	He really brought it on himself.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00226	The window is obstructed by the blinds so you\ncan't see inside.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00227	Tommy sure doesn't seem to\ncare if anyone catches him\nslacking off.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00228	Maybe there just aren't that\nmany guests that visit?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00229	You can't tell what's happening through the\nclosed blinds.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00231	The music is playing through the\nspeaker at the end of this cord.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00232	Will I get in trouble if I unplug it?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00233	There are red and yellow cords on the ground\nthat go to the speaker.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00234	I can see why he would unplug\nthis. I mean, listen to the song\nthat's playing!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00235	There are red and yellow cords on the ground\nthat go to the speakers.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00236	This shelf is a mess. How can\nthey run a business like this?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00237	Many cardboard boxes are set haphazardly\non the shelf.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00238	The box looks wrecked. The\njerky looks done for too.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r2shi_00239	The jerky has been thrown from the box and\nscattered across the floor.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00103	"Mine closed." Why is there a\nmine at a lake?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00104	It's locked up tight, so I guess\nI'm not getting past this point.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00105	"Lawrence mine closed." This\nmust be the mine Tommy\nmentioned.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00106	It says "keep out," I better not\ngo past here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00107	Keep out. Lawrence Mine closed.\nNo entry allowed.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00108	So to get to Dad's cottage... I\nfollow the lake and go straight.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00109	Northeast: Clock tower, Cottage Area\nSouth: Guesthouse
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00110	I'll bet past here there's a walking\ntrail that follows the lakeshore\naround.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00111	Great weather for a walk,\nanyway.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00112	There's a big gate at the beginning of a\nwalking trail.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00113	It looks like they used to rent\nout boats and fishing rods here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00114	Lake Juliet Boathouse
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00115	The oars have seen better days.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00116	Did they just forget to lock all\nthis up when they closed the\nboathouse?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00117	The oars and other wooden items in this\nbarrel are extremely weather-beaten.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00118	There aren't a lot of people or\nhouses around, so this could be\na good spot to practice guitar.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00119	The weather's so nice, I wish I\nhad brought it with me.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00120	There's a white bench on the side of the\nwalking trail.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00123	This tree is HUGE, especially\ncompared to the other ones.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00124	I wonder how old it is. Maybe it's\neven older than the lake!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00125	The tree casts a huge shadow over the field.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00126	This tree has a lot of memories\nfor Matthew.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00127	I hope he gets to make even more\nwith this dad!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00128	Signposts are really helpful for\npeople who have never been\nhere before.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00129	North: Clock Tower, West: Guesthouse\nEast: Cottage Area
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00130	I feel like I've seen one of these\nsomewhere before...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00131	What kind of gadget is this?\nA security camera, maybe?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00132	A device that looks like a camera is\ninstalled at the top of a white pole.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00133	Unbelievable that all these\ncameras were connected to\nANOTHER...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00134	They should probably replace all\nthese cameras, just to be sure\nANOTHER is gone.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00145	There is a security camera installed at the top\nof this pole.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00135	I wonder if there are mermaid\nlegends about Lake Juliet.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00136	I mean, they went and made a\nwhole bronze statue, so...maybe?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00137	There is a bronze statue of a mermaid, placed\nscenically in front of the lake.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00138	Just a blank billboard.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00139	Seems like a good spot for an ad,\nright by the path and all...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00140	There's a blank billboard by the covered bridge.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00141	This illustration is so realistic,\nI'm getting hungry!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00142	How wild that Mom inspired the\nSalmon Rice Burger!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00143	I wonder if I've ever eaten one\nof those rice balls she liked.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00144	A poster shows an appetizing illustration of\na burger.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00149	Hey, what's with the can on the\nground? You're supposed to\nthrow these away!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00150	Hmph. Can on the ground.\nWhy can't people be more\nconsiderate?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3are_00151	Who left this can here? I should\npick it up.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00091	There's a schedule and a bunch\nof notes. I guess this is how the\npeople who worked here kept\ntrack of things.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00092	There are various printed documents pinned\nto the corkboard.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00093	There's a picture of a big yacht\nhere. Did they also rent yachts?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00094	Wait—this wasn't taken at the\nlake. I can see the horizon.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00095	There's a photo of a yacht at sea on the wall.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00096	All of the pamphlets on the shelves are dusty.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00097	They've got guides on fishing,\nplus magazines about yachts\nand sailing.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00098	I've been on a boat before, but\nI wonder if fishing is any fun.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00099	All of the pamphlets on the shelves are dusty.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00101	If I won money like that...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00102	I'd start with an amp for my\nguitar, and then...so many\ngood choices!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00103	There's a newspaper article about a man who\nwon the lottery.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00104	There's a large, mounted fish on the wall.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00105	"New Record! 34.57 lb. Salmon."\nHuh.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00106	I'm surprised a fish this big was\nswimming around in the lake.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00107	So if there are salmon this big\nin the lake...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00108	could there be giant monsters\nout there that eat them?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00109	The plaque reads "New Record.\n34.57 lb. King Salmon."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00111	Wow. I guess people really do\nwin those big jackpots...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00112	There's a list of the winners from lottery\nrounds 21 through 30 in 1999.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00113	Looks like a notebook for\nmanaging reservations.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00114	The page it's open to has names\nof guests who made reservations\neach month.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00115	A reception notebook has been left out open\non the desk.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00116	Someone left a can of juice out.\nHow long has it been here?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00117	Maybe since the boathouse was\nclosed? Ew.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00118	An unopened can of juice is collecting dust\non the desk.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00119	Ooh, a ceiling fan! Fancy!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00120	Hopefully they'll use it again\nwhen the boathouse opens back\nup someday.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00121	The ceiling fan is off right now.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00122	These are files on guests and\ndifferent boats.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00123	This is a lot of files and a ton of\ndifferent kinds of documents.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00124	There are thick file folders filled with old\ndocuments concerning the business.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00125	I guess this is all supplies for the\nboathouse.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00126	Yeah, there are oil tanks and\ncans of paint. That must be it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00127	There are assorted supplies scattered around\nthe shelves.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00128	Why would they just leave this\nbroken fishing rod here?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00129	It's not out in the open, so maybe\nsomeone just forgot to throw\nit away?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00130	This fishing rod has been snapped in half.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00131	I guess this is why they call it\na "boathouse."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00132	Kinda fun to think about all the\nfun trips these boats have taken\npeople on...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00133	There are six wooden boats stowed by\nthe windows.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00134	Huh. It's set up so you just open\nthe shutter door and you're right\non the lake.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00135	Is this for emergencies or \nsomething? Rescuing people who\nfall into the lake?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00136	An aging motorboat is docked, ready to head\nout onto the lake.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00137	It looks like this shutter door\nhasn't been opened in a\nlong time.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00138	No one's even touched this thing\nin years...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00139	Dust has collected between the slats of the\nshutter.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00146	Huh. Oars are a lot lighter than\nthey look.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00147	Still, seems like a lot of work to\nmove a whole boat around with\nthese.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00148	There are several boat oars standing up.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00149	Looks like they used to rent\nout gear. Probably did pretty\ngood business.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00150	There's a shelf of life jackets for rent.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00151	This certificate is a business\npermit for the boathouse.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3bhi_00152	The boathouse's business permit is on the wall.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl1_00034	Are these clock-repair tools?\nThey're pretty dusty now.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl1_00035	Lots of books too... Are they,\nlike, clock technical guides?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl1_00036	The upper shelves hold repair tools, and the\nlower ones have technical manuals.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl1_00037	How does this tool even work?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl1_00038	These manuals seem really\ncomplicated.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl1_00039	The upper shelves hold repair tools, and the\nlower ones have technical manuals.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl1_00040	There's a clock inside this clock\ntower. Weird.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl1_00041	...But I guess you can't see the\nbig clock from in here, so that\nmakes sense.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl1_00042	The clock on the wall has long since stopped.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl1_00055	This window is tiny, and the\nangle's all wrong to see any of\nthe scenery outside!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl1_00056	Guess it just lets light in.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl1_00057	There is a small window with iron bars on it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl1_00061	There are dusty books and tools scattered\nabout on the workbench.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl2_00039	What's this wire? It's connected\nto the ceiling...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl2_00025	Wow. Look at all those big and\nlittle gears!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl2_00026	I could watch them all day...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl2_00027	Many gears and shafts turn in a complicated\ndance.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl2_00028	I guess they need to clean\neverywhere, even in a room\nthat's just a big machine.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl2_00029	Must have been a real pain to\nbring water all this way though.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl2_00030	Various cleaning tools are stored in the\ncorner, including a bucket and a squeegee.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl2_00031	The one machine runs all four\nof the big clocks. Neat.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl2_00032	I guess that makes more sense\nthan building four complete\nclocks.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl2_00033	Each of the four large clocks is powered by a\nshaft coming from the central machine.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl2_00036	So this single wire is what rings\nthat giant bell?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl2_00037	That's pretty incredible when\nyou think about it...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl2_00038	The thick wire coming out of the machine feeds\nthrough the hole in the ceiling.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl3_00015	The view of the lake from up\nhere must be like the prettiest\nthing ever.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl3_00016	Sad that it's all boarded up now.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3cl3_00017	You can see bits of the beautiful, blue sky past\nthe boards.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00063	These footprints...they must be\nMatthew's!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00064	The footprints on the floor head toward the\ndoor to the next room.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00065	These photos of the lake are all\ngorgeous!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00066	There are photos on the wall of Lake Juliet\nand the surrounding area.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00067	Oh, this is a photo of the clock\ntower.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00068	It looks like they took this photo\nfrom in front of this house.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00069	There's a photo of the clock tower by the lake.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00070	I guess the person who lived here\nliked books.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00071	I'll bet they sat and read in that\nchair by the fireplace.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00072	There are hardcover novels in the small\nbookcase by the fireplace.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00073	Mmm. A nice chair in front of\nthe fireplace on a cold winter\nday...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00074	Sounds pretty great, honestly.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00075	A well-crafted wooden chair sits here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00076	No one's living here, but they\ndidn't move out, either.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00077	There are still dishes in the sink.\nDid something happen while they\nwere washing the dishes?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00078	The sink is filled with half-washed dishes.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00079	That's a big kettle.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00080	I bet you could boil all sorts of\nwater in that thing.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00081	There's a large kettle on the stove.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00082	There's still sauces and dishes\nand stuff here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00083	Why did the owner just disappear\nand leave all this here?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00084	The shelves are filled with dishes and half-full\nbottles of condiments.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00085	Who is this?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00086	There is a large photo of a woman\nsurrounded by flowers.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00087	She's so pretty. Oh yeah... I\nheard about that photographer\nwho eloped.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00088	This must be Olivia.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phl_00089	It's a photo of Olivia, most likely taken by\nGilbert.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00072	Huh. Lots of stuff still here, but\nthis hutch is empty.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00073	Whatever was in here must have\nbeen important if it's all they\ntook when they left.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00074	The hutch in the corner is empty.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00075	I think the top one is a sunset\nand the bottom is a sunrise.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00076	The scenery here is so pretty!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00077	There are photos of the lake at sunrise and\nsunset.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00078	These albums are huge! And\nthere's two for each year?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00079	How many pictures does a\nphotographer take in a year?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00080	The shelves are filled with large photo albums.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00081	"Photography Techniques,"\n"Engineering Your Exposures,"\n"The Magic of Shadows," "Lens\nPhilosophy"...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00082	"Composition Revolution," "The\nMiracle of Apertures"... Are\nthese all technical books about\nphotography?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00083	Various technical photography books are\npacked tightly in the bottom of the bookcase.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00084	Is this bag for holding a camera?\nIt seems kind of big...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00085	But I suppose you need room for\nextra lenses and film and all.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00087	This bag looks the same as the\ncamera bag in the basement.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00088	Maybe they had a special bag for\neach camera?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00089	There is a large cloth bag in a section of the\nbookcase.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00094	"National Photo Contest, Grand\nPrize: Gilbert Moss"
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00095	Right, this is a tripod, for holding\nthe camera still. Bigger than I\nthought.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00096	Photographers have to work\npretty hard, carrying all this\ngear around.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00097	A metal tripod leans against the wall.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00110	This calendar is from five years\nago. It's like time just stopped\nin here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00111	The calendar on the wall is dated five\nyears ago.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00112	Is Gilbert the photographer who\nlived here?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00113	There's a newspaper article introducing a\nphotographer who's moving to the lake's shore.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00116	These four are all just beautiful.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00117	I'd love to have a pretty portrait\nlike these taken of me.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phs_00118	There are four photos on the wall.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00084	I guess this thing controls the\npower for the house.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00085	I don't want to accidentally kill\nthe power or anything, so I won't\ntouch it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00086	There's a lever here that controls power to\nthe house.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00087	Weird place to hang photos.\nDid they get wet or something?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00088	Weren't they worried about the\npictures falling in the tub?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00089	There are printed photos hanging on a line\nover the bathtub.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00090	Doesn't feel like they used this\nplace for bathing, does it?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00091	Did they have another bathroom?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00092	The bathtub is old and dirty.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00093	I'm not sure I like the idea of a\ntoilet in the basement.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00094	What if you had to go in the\nmiddle of the night? Creepy!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00095	The toilet shows signs of not having been used\nin a very long time.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00096	It sure is dusty. No one's used\nthis in years.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00097	The mirror's surface is so covered in dust that\nyou can't see anything in it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00098	What's this? More photography\nequipment?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00099	I guess there's a lot more to\nphotography than I realized...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00100	There's a strange machine that you\ncan't identify.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00101	"Developing solution," "fixing\nagent"... Chemicals for\ndeveloping film, I guess.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00102	Do you...soak your photos in\nthis tray to develop them?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00103	There are jars of chemicals for developing\nphotos on the tray.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00106	This is film. Jessica showed me\nsome once.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00107	Isn't it bad to leave it hanging\nout like this?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00108	Strips of film hang from the line over the\nbathtub.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00109	There's a portable electric stove among the\nequipment for developing photos.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00110	An electric stove? Is this for\ndeveloping photos?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00111	Maybe they just used it to boil\nwater for coffee or whatever\nwhile they were working?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00112	There's a portable electric stove on the\ncounter.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00113	Is this bag for holding a camera?\nIt seems kind of big...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00114	But I suppose you need room for\nextra lenses and film and all.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00115	I guess this is probably a\ncamera bag.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00116	They probably need room for\nlenses and film and stuff, not\njust the camera.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00117	There's a large cloth bag tucked under the\nstaircase.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00118	Chemicals, beakers... It looks\nlike a chemistry lab in here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00119	There are beakers and chemicals used for\ndeveloping photos.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00120	I wonder where Matthew's dad\nwent.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00121	Poor Matthew. I hope we can get\nthem back together...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r3phu_00122	There's a photo of Matthew with his parents\nand younger sister.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00101	Pretty flowers...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00102	Wait—does Dad actually take\ncare of these?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00103	Potted plants with orange flowers are set by\nthe front door.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00104	J.C. Valley is north. That's where\nDad works.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00105	North: J.C. Valley, East: East Gate\nSouth: Clock Tower.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00106	This is a nice cottage. Why isn't\nanyone living here?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00107	Great scenery, looks cozy. Is the\nrent really high or something?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00108	For Rent
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00109	Nice to see they've got fire\nhydrants here, just in case.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00110	Yellow fire hydrants dot the cottage area.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00111	This gate looks super heavy-\nduty. Do they need this kind of\nsecurity here?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00112	Doesn't look easy to get through\nat all.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00113	The path to the lab is blocked by a steel gate.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00114	This logo is for Dad's lab.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00115	That must mean the lab is inside,\nright?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00116	There's a monument with the J.C. Valley logo\nengraved on it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00117	Another one of those poles I've\nseen around...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00118	That doesn't look like a street\nlight. Is it a security camera?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00119	There's a white pole with a device on top that\nlooks like a camera.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00120	Unbelievable that all these\ncameras were connected to\nANOTHER...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00121	They should probably replace all\nthese cameras, just to be sure\nANOTHER is gone.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00158	There is a security camera installed at the top\nof this pole.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00122	This is a convenient spot for a\ntrash can, right by the road.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00124	The trash can is well maintained.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00125	This car has the restaurant's\nlogo on it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00126	Do they use this car to pick up\nsupplies or something?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00127	There's a large SUV parked in the lot.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00128	Oof. That's sure a smell, all right.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00129	This must be where they put the\nfood waste. I'm not touching it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00130	There's a garbage can by the restaurant for\nfood waste.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00131	There's a road past the gate.\nProbably leads to the nearest\ntown?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00132	If I'd come by car instead of bus,\nI probably could have come\nthrough here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00133	There's a road for cars beyond the gate.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00134	What a cute, cozy little cottage!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00135	This would be perfect for a\nrelaxing vacation.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00136	There's a small cottage with yellow walls.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00138	This is a nice house. The big bay\nwindow makes it seem fancy.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00139	This is definitely the one I'd rent.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00140	The purple cottage has an eye-catching design\non the bay window.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00141	That yellow door and the big\nchimney sure stand out...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00142	Lots of big windows too.\nProbably gets great light.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00143	A large chimney juts out of the roof of the\nblue cottage.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00144	Huh. No windows on the first\nfloor.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00145	...Now I really want to know what\nit looks like in there.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00146	There's a big, two-story cottage with no\nwindows on the first floor.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00147	Ooh, it's all green, like it's one\nwith nature. I like that.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00148	So this place wasn't empty\nafter all—Ryan lives here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00149	Does everyone from J.C. Valley\nlive around here?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00167	Was everything I saw in this\ncottage some sort of illusion?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00150	This distinctive cottage has an all-green\nexterior.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00151	This place is huge! It looks even\nbigger compared to its\nneighbors.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00152	It's basically a mansion, not a\n"cottage" at all!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00153	There's a big stone house inside an\nelaborate gate.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00154	Ooh, an empty can! You've got\na date with the recycling\nmachine, my little friend.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00155	Another empty can. I should\npick that up.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00156	This illustration is so good it's\nmaking me hungry!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00157	This poster features an appetizing illustration\nof a burger.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00159	There's a For Rent sign.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00160	Huh? Doesn't Ryan live here?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00161	Did someone forget to take down\nthe sign?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00162	There's a For Rent sign in front of Ryan's\ncottage.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00163	I guess no one lived here\nafter all.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00164	There's a For Rent sign.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00165	Aw. Sweet thing. Looks pretty\ncomfortable. I should let it rest.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4are_00166	A cat is sleeping curled up under the car.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00032	This flower arrangement is so\ncute! Setting these up must be\nso much fun.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00033	I wonder if the same person who\ndoes the flower arrangements\ndoes the cleaning too.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00034	A cute and colorful flower arrangement sits in\nthe vase atop the chest.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00035	The woman in this photo is really\npretty. Is this Elizabeth's mom?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00036	There's a photo of a beautiful woman on\nthe nightstand.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00037	This bed sure is cute. And so big!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00038	It looks like a bed a princess\nwould sleep in. I'm kind of jealous.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00039	There's a large pink bed, fitted with the finest\nof silk sheets.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00040	I can't just go around peeping in\nother peoples' closets.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00041	Besides, this isn't just anyone's\ncloset... It's Elizabeth's. Who\nknows what she'd say if she\nfound out I was snooping.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00042	Elizabeth would never speak to\nme again if I opened this.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00043	What a big vanity.\nUgh... So jealous.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00044	Big mirror, plenty of space, lots\nof drawers... Beauty meets\nfunction meets elegance!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00045	The pink vanity is fitted with a large mirror and\nlots of storage space. It's the height of luxury.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00051	This pink wallpaper is so cute!\nIt suits the room perfectly.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00052	Wallpaper can really set the\nvibe of a room.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00053	Vibe-setting pink wallpaper with a flower\npattern covers the walls.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00054	So Elizabeth was happy once,\nhuh? Princess is still so cute.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cae_00055	There's a photo of Elizabeth as a child, smiling\nand hugging Princess.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00042	This plant's so big it has its\nown presence.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00043	I don't even think it would fit in\nmy bedroom back home.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00044	The leaves of the large houseplant reach out\nfar and wide.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00045	There's so much detail in this\npainting. The petals are\nphoto-realistic.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00046	The frame's really fancy too.\nI feel like I'm in a museum.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00047	There's a painting of small yellow flowers in a\nfancy decorative golden frame.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00048	Is any shelf containing books\na bookshelf? Or does the\ncarpenter's intent make\na difference?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00049	This would be a handy place\nto keep keys and sunglasses\nand stuff.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00050	Some books sit on the mounted shelf.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00051	These flowers are just like\nthe ones Jessica puts around\nour house.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00052	I don't know much about flowers,\nbut I guess these are the go-to\nkind for decorating.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00053	There are white flowers in a simple vase.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00076	Someone around here must have\na real green thumb to keep all\nthese plants and flowers looking\nso pretty.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00077	They look like they're thriving.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00078	The shelves contain many potted plants and\ncolorful flowers.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00079	This is a nice landscape photo.\nWait, is this actually a painting?!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00080	It looks like Lake Juliet.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00081	The painting depicts the evening sun shining\nover a lake and a forest.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00082	I guess having a house this big\nmeans you have lots of space\nfor hanging paintings.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00083	They even have wall space for\nreally large paintings.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00084	The abstract painting is in a splendid frame.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00085	I wonder where the mountain in\nthis painting is located.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00086	I'm no art connoisseur, but I\ndon't doubt this painting came\nwith a big price tag.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00087	There's a pricey-looking landscape painting of\ndistant mountains.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00088	Locked. Guess I can't get in.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00089	The door near the stairs is locked.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00090	Whoa. This whole table is made\nof marble.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00091	The marble coffee table exudes luxury.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00092	This chandelier is small, but it's\na pretty cute design.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cai_00093	A cute chandelier hangs from the ceiling.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00029	This must be the cake Elizabeth's\ndad mentioned.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00030	It looks so good... Ugh, I should\nhave accepted his offer.\nI love cheesecake.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00031	An appetizing and taunting aroma rises from\nthe cheesecake on the counter.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00032	These apples and grapefruit look\npretty tasty.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00033	The basket is full of fresh fruit.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00034	A well-balanced breakfast in an\nelegant space bathed in the\nmorning light...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00035	Ahh, it sounds so nice.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00036	A dining table is set near the windows to\nmaximize natural light.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00037	A car magazine and an art \nmagazine... I wonder if these\nare Elizabeth's dad's hobbies.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00038	The magazine rack contains magazines about\ncars and art.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00039	These are all action movies.\nThey're a little old, but I've at\nleast heard of most of them.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00040	They're all from before I was\nborn. I wonder if this is\nElizabeth's dad's collection.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00041	There's a DVD collection of famous action\nmovies from the 80s.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00042	These flowers are just like the\nones at Dad's front door.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00043	Did Dad grow these flowers and\nthen give them as a gift?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00044	The orange flowers in the vase are in\nfull bloom.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00045	Even the phone is fancy. Hmm, I\nwonder what happened to Dad...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00046	Has he come back from the\nlab yet?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cal_00047	There's a small cordless phone on the\nglass table.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4car_00020	I bet Elizabeth's dad has\na variety of outfits. Unlike\nmy dad.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4car_00021	I'll look like a thief if I just start\nrummaging through someone\nelse's closet.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4car_00022	Is this a journal? I'd better not\ntouch it, I don't want to read it\nwithout permission.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4car_00023	There's a leather-bound notebook on the desk.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4car_00024	"National Foundation for\nInnovation?" I'm not sure\nwhat that is, but...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4car_00025	I guess it means Elizabeth's dad is\na special member of some group.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4car_00026	The frames contain a medal and certificates.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cll_00023	What's this supposed to be a\npainting of? I can't tell at all.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cll_00024	Is this what they call\n"contemporary art"?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cll_00025	Two large abstract paintings hang on the wall.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cll_00026	What a stylish sofa. It somehow\nseems perfect for Ryan.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cll_00027	I bet it's good for napping on.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cll_00028	There's a stylish and comfy-looking sofa.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cll_00029	Ryan's bedroom must be past\nhere. And it's pretty rude to\ngo into someone's bedroom\nwithout permission!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cll_00030	Ryan's bedroom is past this door.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cll_00031	Is this a security camera? It's the\nsame as the cameras outside.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cll_00032	Is this really necessary in\na house?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cll_00033	Something that looks like a security camera\nhangs on the wall.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cls_00014	Sure is a big bookshelf for so\nfew books...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cls_00015	I always imagine researchers'\nhomes being packed floor to\nceiling with books.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cls_00016	Only a small section of the large bookshelf\ncontains books.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cls_00017	I saw an infomercial about this\nbefore. I wonder if it does all\nthe things they claimed...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cls_00018	Haha. Ryan must have seen\nit on TV and wondered the\nsame thing.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cls_00019	There's an expensive-looking reclining chair.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cls_00020	Pretty standard look. Matches\nthe room.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cls_00021	No clothes on it though. Maybe\nhe keeps them in a closet?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4cls_00022	Hangers hang on the coatrack.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00057	Dad buys something online\nalmost every day.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00058	One of these days he'll wind up\nbuying the same thing twice and\nthrowing one out.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00059	Many magazines and books are tied together\nwith string.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00062	That was a lot of work to look at\na single file.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00063	Looking up old data is\nsurprisingly difficult.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00097	Let's check out that unknown\ncontaminant.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00098	*grumble*
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00099	Ashley, I'm so hungry I\ncould faint!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00100	Kind of dramatic, but all right.\nLet's go eat first.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00101	Let's check out that unknown\ncontaminant.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00102	Ugh. I don't understand this\nat all.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00103	Maybe my dad will go over\nit with us.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00104	Do you want to check out the\nunknown contaminant?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00105	Nah. I wanna go to the clock\ntower right now.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00107	I wonder what kind of research\nDad will do now... Whatever it is,\nI hope he enjoys it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00064	There's a floppy drive connected to\nthe computer.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00106	I'll ask Dad about the unknown\ncontaminant later.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00108	The computer has been shut down.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00065	Are these research materials?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00066	There are a lot of books and rolled-up papers\nin the cardboard box.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00067	Ugh, this bookshelf is a mess.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00068	I want to organize these books\nso bad...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00069	Technical and academic books are scattered\nall over.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00070	Huh. This novel was just turned\ninto a movie.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00071	I've been curious about the\nbook. I should ask Dad if I\ncan borrow it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00072	Some novels are mixed in with complicated\nacademic books.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00073	Did these fall here or did Dad\nplace them here? The fact I\ncan't tell says a lot...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00074	Either way, I probably shouldn't\ntouch them without asking him.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00075	Lots of books and files are scattered\non the floor.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00076	How much sleep is Dad getting?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00077	Even when we lived together, he\nwould stay up late working. I'm\na little worried about him.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00078	Richard's bed is unmade.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00093	Not much in the drawer.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00094	Typical. He has all this storage\nspace, but just leaves his things\nlaying all over.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00095	The drawer is empty except for a few\nsmall things.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crb_00096	It's Michael's briefcase.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00087	Dad blends with black tea?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00088	I wonder what kind of herb he's\nusing. I can't place its smell.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00089	A mortar, pestle, and tea cup were abandoned\nin the middle of being used.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00091	Let's see... A few veggies, a few\ncondiments, and Cool POP.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00092	Guess he doesn't like cooking\nfor himself.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00093	The fridge contains Cool POP, condiments, and\njust a few vegetables.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00095	There's more to drink in this\nkitchen than there is to eat.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00096	I've gotta remember to ask Dad\nif he's eating...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00097	The pitcher is full of drinking water.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00099	Well, at least he's keeping this\nspace clean.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00100	Thankfully, the toilet is kept clean.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00101	It's so like him to hang his jacket\nlike this.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00102	The jacket will lose its shape\nwithout a hanger!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00107	A jacket is hung carelessly on the coat stand.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00108	What a sloppy way to hang your\njacket. That's so Dad.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00109	Don't come crying to me when\nit loses its shape because you\ndidn't use a hanger!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00114	A jacket is hung over the large sofa.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00117	Dad needs to take better care\nof his jackets. This is so like him.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00118	Don't come crying to me when\nit loses its shape because you\ndidn't use a hanger!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00123	A jacket has been carelessly left on the\nkitchen chair.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00124	Huh? This clock has stopped.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00125	I bet Dad hasn't even noticed.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00126	There's a vase, lantern, and tabletop clock\nabove the fireplace.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00132	Dad's bag is stuffed full. What's\nhe always carrying around?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00133	The highly functional backpack has\nplenty of pockets.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00134	The space around Dad's sink\nsure is bare.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00135	Jessica and I have all sorts of\nmakeup and cosmetics around\nour sink back home.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00136	There's a cup with a toothbrush in it, and\nthat's about it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00137	I don't need to call anyone\nright now.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00138	There's a cordless phone on the table.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00139	We probably won't see each\nother for a while, but it sure\nwould be nice if he'd call me\nnow and then.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00140	But I guess I can be the one to\npick up the phone.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00149	I've never seen this brand of\ndetergent before.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00150	The one we use at home smells\nway better... Dad should use\nthat one instead.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00151	But the fact he's doing laundry\nat all is a win, so I guess I won't\nbring it up.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00152	There's inferior laundry detergent on the rack.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00146	I'm so glad I finally got the\nRAS off.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00147	But it feels kind of lonely\nwithout it...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00148	The RAS has been removed.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00153	I can't believe he actually bought\na special hat just for camping...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00154	Does he really think this\nwill convince anyone he's\nsomehow outdoorsy?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4crl_00155	There's a wide-brimmed hat hanging\nfrom the rack, still in mint condition.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00065	Looks like they sell things other\nthan salmon rice burgers.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00066	Chicken salad, chili dogs... Ohh,\napple pie sounds good.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00110	There's a menu board.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00067	If there's a Cool POP sign, it must\nmean they sell it here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00068	There's a Cool POP sign.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00069	This counter is made of real\nwood. It's simple yet classy.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00070	I like the no-frills atmosphere of\nthis place. It's kind of retro.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00071	The countertop is made from a single\npiece of wood.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00072	Huh, I guess this place serves\nalcoholic drinks too.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00073	Dad likes a drink now and then.\nI wonder how often he comes\nhere for one.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00074	There's a beer tap by the register.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00075	This poster claims that even\nmermaids love the salmon\nrice burger. Does Bob know\na mermaid?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00076	We're kind of far from the\nlakeshore. I wonder if that\nmeans this place delivers.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00077	There's a poster of a mermaid with a burger.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00078	It's the staff room. I shouldn't go\nin without permission.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00079	Staff Only
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00080	These two sure look alike. Hold\non... That guy...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00081	Oh man, it's the captain! Are\nthese two brothers?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00082	There's a photo of Bob with the captain you\nmet two years ago.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00085	I think this is the original Cool\nPOP logo, that they used back\nwhen it first launched.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00086	I remember Dad saying there was\nonly one flavor at first.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00087	There's a poster with the old logo for Cool POP.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00088	Mustard and hot sauce have\nreally been growing on me lately.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00089	Must mean I'm growing up!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00090	There are free condiments on the table.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00091	It's a solid-body guitar. I use an\nacoustic-electric one.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00092	But you can rock out so\nhard with one of these\nand an effects pedal!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00093	Tommy's guitar is propped up.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00094	I need to get a lot more guitar\npractice in before the contest!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00095	I'm gonna get so good there's no\nway I'll lose to Tommy and them.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00096	I'd love to have one of these\nbig amps too.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00097	But I can't afford much more\nthan a guitar right now... I'll\nhave one of these someday.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00098	An amp and speaker are set in a corner\nof the restaurant.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00099	There's a photo of Richard with some friends.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00100	After Mom died, Dad was totally\nconsumed by research for the\nANOTHER. He worked on it all\nby himself.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00101	But now he has friends,\nand he found things other\nthan research to enjoy.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00102	He really looks like he's enjoying\nlife these days.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00103	There's a photo of a young Bob at a food stand.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00104	This photo was taken around\nthe time Mom brought me to\nLake Juliet.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00105	Mom had lost her memories of\nher family and the ANOTHER\nthat day...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r4res_00106	But I still feel her love.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00065	What a big box. Wonder\nwhat's inside.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00066	Wooden crates of different sizes have been\nleft in the corner of the yard.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00067	This rocking chair is simple,\nyet elegant.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00068	Basking in the sun as you rock\nnear the garden... It sounds\nso relaxing.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00069	There's a wooden rocking chair in front\nof the house.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00070	These shears must be for\ntrimming shrubs and plants.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00071	I wonder how long it takes to\ntrim a garden this size...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00072	Well-used pruning shears lean against the wall.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00073	This must be where they keep\nthe logs from all the trees they\ncut down.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00074	There are so many. I wonder\nwhat they're for.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00075	Who cuts these down and drags\nthem all the way here?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00076	No way Charlotte's strong\nenough to carry something\nlike this... Is she?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00077	There are lots of big, mossy logs piled up.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00078	Having a greenhouse in the yard\nseems pretty nice.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00079	It gets plenty of sunlight so it\nmust be able to grow anything.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00080	The greenhouse is made of nice, sturdy glass.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00081	Empty plant pots. I wonder what's\ngoing to be planted next.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00082	Empty plant pots and a bag of gardening soil\nsit in front of the greenhouse.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00083	These gardening tools look like\nthey've seen a lot of use.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00084	The bucket, spade, and shovel look like they've\nserved many seasons.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00085	The rope's come off! The log is\nloose, that's so dangerous!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00086	If someone was walking along\nall spaced out, they'd fall off\nfor sure.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00087	A portion of the railing is broken.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00088	There's nothing else for me to do\nunder there.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00089	I won't make it to the bus in time\nif I head all the way down there.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00090	I'll be late for the bus if I go\ndown there.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00091	Has this always been broken?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00092	It's underside is rotting. Looks\nlike it was abandoned a long\ntime ago.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00093	This wood doesn't look like it's\ngood for much.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00094	The wood on the side of the path is rotten and\ncovered in moss.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00098	Littering is bad to begin with,\nbut this is someone's house.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00099	The rope broke. I guess there's\nno going back now.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5are_00100	The bridge's railing rope is completely broken.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00045	The more I look at this clock,\nthe more it looks like the\nclock tower.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00046	It's a pretty cute design. Kinda\nlooks like it got shrunk down.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00047	A clock made to look like the clock tower.\nIt even has a face on all four sides.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00051	I wonder if Charlotte's husband\nmade all of these.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00052	Their shapes and sizes are so\nvaried and fun. I really like\nlooking at them.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00053	There's a pendulum clock hung on the wall.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00056	Huh, this clock has three dials.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00057	I guess that's so you can tell what\ntime it is in three different\ntime zones.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00058	There's a clock with three dials, each set to\na different time.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00059	This one's so cute! I've never\nseen a clock with a handle.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00060	That must make carrying it\naround pretty convenient.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00061	There's a clock with a handle.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00064	It doesn't seem to be working,\nbut that's a real fancy clock.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00065	Just having it here really sets\na mood.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00066	There's a large, dusty pendulum clock.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00067	Mom's hometown doesn't feel too\nfar away when I look at a globe.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00068	I'd love to visit Japan one day,\nand see where she was from.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00069	The old globe has an antique feel to it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00070	This box is full of gears and\nother parts.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00071	They look like clock parts. I\nwonder how many clocks you\ncould make out of all this...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00072	The box contains a lot of gears and other\nmaterial needed for making clocks.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00073	This looks like a glass door for\nthe cabinet. I guess it fell off\nand couldn't be fixed.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00074	The glass door has been removed and set\nbetween furniture.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00075	What are these plates\ndoing here?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00076	They're covered in dust. I\nwonder how long they've\nbeen here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00077	There are some dusty plates in the basket.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00078	The barrel's empty. I wonder\nwhat it was used for.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00079	There's an empty barrel in the corner of\nthe shed.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00080	The tools around here sure are\nclean. They must not be used\nall that often.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00081	Farming tools, including a shovel and a bucket,\nare in the corner of the shed.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00082	Is this clock older than the rest?\nThe wood's color is different.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5bai_00083	The color of the wood gives the sense that this\nclock has counted more hours than most.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5grg_00024	There are pictures of vegetables\non the bag. This soil must be\nfor vegetables.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5grg_00025	So growing different things\nrequires different types of\nsoil... There's a lot that goes\ninto gardening, huh?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5grg_00026	The bags of potting soil have pictures of\nvegetables on them.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5grg_00027	What's that smell? Is it coming\nfrom the leaves of this plant?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5grg_00028	Could these be herbs? I've never\nseen them like this before.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5grg_00029	These herbs sort of smell like the\nblack tea at Dad's cottage.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5grg_00030	I wonder if this is where he got\nit from.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5grg_00031	Mm, it smells so nice. I want to\nput some in my pocket and carry\nit around all day.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5grg_00032	There are so many potted\nflowers here. And they're\nall blooming so beautifully!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5grg_00033	I don't know the name of these\nflowers, but I can tell they're\nwell cared for.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5grg_00034	The colorful potted flowers are in full bloom.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5grg_00035	This plant's leaves are huge.\nI wonder what it's called.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5grg_00036	Large, vibrant leaves stretch out of the potted\nplant on the ground.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00063	The tea and cookies were\nso delicious!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00064	Empty cups and Charlotte's homemade cookies\nare on the table.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00065	This sofa looks old enough to be\nan antique, but it looks very well\nmaintained.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00066	I wonder if any item will last\nforever as long as you take\ngood care of it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00067	There's an antique sofa covered in red fabric.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00068	Whoa. Is this...a rotary phone?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00069	I don't think I've ever seen\none in real life. I wonder if\nit still works.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00070	There's an old light-green rotary phone.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00071	This clock's so nice.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00072	Whoever made it must have been\na total pro.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00073	There's an old, large pendulum clock.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00074	Let's see... "Scarlet Labyrinth,"\nby David Shields.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00075	This book's pretty old.\nBut I feel like I've seen\nit somewhere before...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00076	There are many old novels, their covers faded\nover time.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00077	Something tells me Charlotte\nwouldn't be too happy if I wander\naround without permission.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00078	The door is locked.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00079	I probably shouldn't check out\nother rooms without asking\nCharlotte first.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00080	The door is locked.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00081	Are these family photos? They're\nfrom a long time ago.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00082	I wonder if this person with the\nbeard and glasses is one of\nCharlotte's ancestors.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00083	Black-and-white photos are hung on the wall.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00084	Wow, this pot's pretty cool. I like\nthe gold design.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00085	It's got a nice antique vibe.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00086	The shelves hold painted ceramic pots\nand dishes.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00087	The fireplace is old, but it looks\nlike it's being well taken care of.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00088	It looks nice and tidy, inside\nand out.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00089	The old fireplace is well maintained.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00090	The tableware feels so stylish\nand refined.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00091	The kind of life where you get to\nregularly enjoy the finer things \nseems really nice.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00092	The decorative plates and tea cups in the\ncupboard are elegant and refined.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00093	Oh, wow... Are these vegetables\nfrom the garden outside?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00094	Vegetables are stored within reach of the\ncooking area.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00095	This kitchen is so well organized.\nJust what I'd expect of Charlotte.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00096	Dad and Jessica could learn a\nthing or two...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00097	The kitchen is very well organized despite the\nlimited storage space.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00098	Is this a photo album? It's like a\nrecord of Charlotte's memories.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00099	I wonder if it has old pictures of\nLake Juliet.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r5shl_00100	I want to take a look, but it's\nprobably rude to flip through\nit without permission.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00061	I probably shouldn't go past here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00062	Going through this shelf would\nbe way too dangerous.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00063	Large shelves block the path.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00064	Here's the tire, but where's the\nrest of the car?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00065	This is probably where they\nmaintained the company cars.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00066	An old tire lays abandoned, the degraded\nrubber torn in places.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00067	This place must have been\nabandoned a long time ago if\nno one's fixed the windows.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00068	There are broken shards of glass\nall over. I need to careful.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00069	Some windows are broken. The abandoned\nbuilding looks vandalized.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00070	The inside of the drum is sticky.\nI probably shouldn't touch it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00071	There are traces of some liquid left\nin the drum.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00072	Says here, "Handle with\nextreme caution."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00073	Maybe it was used to store\nsomething fragile, like some\nprecision instruments.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00074	The large wooden crate bares the warning\n"Handle with extreme caution."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00075	I'm glad there are so many\nstreetlights around here.\nThe area's well-lit at night.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00076	There could still be plenty of\npeople coming and going from\nthe lab even though it's so late.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00077	Streetlights at set intervals line the road\nleading to the lab.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00078	This monument must mean it's\nthe main entrance to the lab.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00079	There's a monument with the J.C. Valley logo\nengraved on it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00080	This black car's pretty cool...\nI wonder what sort of person\ndrives it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00081	I think it would suit\nElizabeth's dad.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00082	A cool luxury car is parked.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00083	I wonder whose car this is.\nIt looks comfortable to drive.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00084	I really like its simple design.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00085	The silver car with a simple design is parked.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00086	This security camera is the same\ndesign as the cameras I saw at\nthe lake and cottages.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00087	I get having security cameras\nat the lab, but are they really\nnecessary for somewhere like\nthe lake too?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00088	The security camera resembles the cameras\npositioned around the lake.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00091	According to the map, the area\nwith Dad's cottage is past here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00092	But I can't get back there yet.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6are_00093	The road to the cottage area is blocked by\na sturdy gate.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00059	This locker's door is all bent\nout of shape.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00060	It's too warped to even close.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00061	The old locker's door is so warped it can no\nlonger be shut.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00062	This place has been abandoned\nfor so long it's literally starting\nto fall apart.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00063	The ceiling probably won't come\nfalling down on me though...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00064	Pieces of concrete broken loose from the walls\nand ceiling litter the area.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00065	The text on these documents is\nso faded I can barely read them.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00066	But I can kind of make out the\ndate... Look like this is from\nfive years ago.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00067	There are still documents stuck to the\nbulletin board.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00068	Feedback reports from locals,\necosystem investigation logs,\ndamage estimates for soil and\nwater quality...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00069	Matthew's dad even conducted\nwater-quality investigations.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00070	It must have really stung to be\naccused of causing the pollution\nafter he'd done so much to\nprevent it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00071	These boxes are all sealed shut.\nThere must be some important\ndocuments in them.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00072	There are several dusty, unopened\ncardboard boxes.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00073	Yikes. The crack in his monitor\nis pretty nasty. Did it fall off\nthe desk?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00074	I guess there's no use trying to\nfix something this broken.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00075	The discarded monitor has sustained\nirreparable damage to its LCD.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00076	This is all stuff about the history\nof this area.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00077	I wonder if this "skilled clock\nmaker" is Charlotte's husband.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00078	Inside the box are documents about the history\nof the lake and surrounding areas.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00079	This camera has a different\ndesign than the ones around\nthe lake.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00080	Looks pretty old. I don't think it\nworks anymore.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00081	An old security camera is attached to the top\nof the wall.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00082	I heard buildings fall into\ndisrepair as soon as they're\nabandoned. Maybe there's\nsomething to it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00083	But it's crazy to think that it got\nthis bad in just five years.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00084	The clouded windows are cracked and the\nblinds are broken.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00091	These cardboard boxes\nlook heavy.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00092	The tag on the key said File\nRoom so they must be full of\ndocuments of some sort.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00093	The steel racks are lined with closed\ncardboard boxes.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00094	It looks like there used to be\nsomething on this shelf.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00095	I guess they took everything\nwhen the company closed down.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6cri_00096	The shelves and drawers are all empty.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00056	This is the lab's reception desk.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00057	Getting here was a bit of a\ndetour thanks to Sofia.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00058	There's a large reception counter in the\nlab's lobby.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00059	Dad's on basement level three, in\nthe liquid-memory storage area.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00060	Hang on, Dad. I'm coming to the\nrescue.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00061	I want to know where\nSofia went...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00062	But calling for help comes first.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00063	Footage from the security cameras installed\nthroughout the facilities is on display.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00064	Ian restored part of the\nsecurity system.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00065	But it looks like it'll take a little\nlonger before it's back up and\nrunning fully.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00066	This is the only console that can\ncontrol the security system.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00067	So who attacked it?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00068	The only people in here should be\nus and Sofia.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00069	There's a console that controls the\nsecurity cameras.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00074	I guess the attack on the\nsecurity system stopped\nthe elevator too.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00075	How did Sofia manage to pull all\nthis off on her own?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00076	A system-error message is displayed\non the monitor.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00077	I should be able to get outside\nnow. I need to hurry to\nthe elevator!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00078	The elevator's control system has been\nrebooted. It's now operating normally.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00081	The J.C. Valley logo and numbers for each room\nare on the panel.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00082	There's a photo of Judd. He must\nhave been a brilliant scientist.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00083	J.C. Valley Founder\nJudd Fitzgerald
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00084	It's Elizabeth's dad. I guess he's\nthe lab's top guy.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc0_00085	J.C. Valley Director\nRex Alfred
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00129	Mounted TVs are pretty nice.\nThey don't take up floor space.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00130	I wonder if Dad watches TV here\non his breaks.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00131	A large-screen TV is mounted to the wall.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00132	Now that's a big houseplant.\nGreenery against the white\nwall is a nice look.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00133	There's a tall houseplant in the corner of\nthe room.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00134	This sofa's design is pretty cool.\nIt looks cozy too.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00135	I feel bad for whoever gets\nstuck with the single-seater\nby the wall. You can't see\nthe TV from it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00136	The soft set is all in white and navy blue.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00137	I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00138	Of course everyone here spends\ntheir breaks reading scientific\nmagazines.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00139	The magazine rack is full of old issues of\nscientific magazines.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00140	Whoa, what's with all the Cool\nPOP? Was this Dad's doing?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00141	They have every flavor. Not\neven vending machines have\nselections this wide.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00142	The large fridge is packed to the brim\nwith Cool POP.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00143	The lab may be in a lake, but this\nroom sure is warm...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00144	I bet the workers gather here to\ntalk about science and stuff.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00145	The water cooler is full of mineral water.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00146	Pretty nice that coffee\nis provided.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00147	Sugar and cream, however, is\nnot... I guess researchers like\ntheir coffee black.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00148	There's a coffee maker that grinds and brews\nfresh beans.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00149	"We conduct our research day\nand night in pursuit of solutions\nto environmental issues."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00150	Lake pollution definitely counts\nas an "environmental issue."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00151	J.C. Valley's Eco-friendly Efforts
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00152	That's a lot of candy. Is this just,\nlike...up for grabs?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00153	I remember Dad telling me that\nthought-intensive work always\nactivates his sweet tooth.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00154	The large glass container is full of candy.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00156	There are half-eaten donuts and\na container from a salmon rice\nburger in here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00157	The garbage can is overflowing\nwith food containers and\nwrappers.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00158	The cabinet is overflowing with food.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00159	"This laboratory utilizes a highly\nadvanced security system that\nrelies on biometric data."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00160	"However, this means the system\nis susceptible to hacking by\nindividuals who possess certain\nbiometric information."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00161	I...have...no idea what this means.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00162	There's a note reporting on the rigidity of the\nsecurity system. Gina Barnes signed off on it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00163	This looks like Pinky Rabbit, but\nmade entirely of beads.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00164	This is so cool! Is this\nall handmade?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00165	The bead art depicts Pinky Rabbit.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00166	Ugh, there are so many crumbs\non this keyboard.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00167	You gotta be careful when\neating at the computer.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00168	Food crumbs can be seen wedged between\nthe keys of the keyboard.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00169	This book looks familiar. I think I\nsaw it in Dad's room.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00170	Maybe everyone's reading the\nsame technical book. Are they\nin a study group together?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00171	It's the same technical book as the one in\nRichard's room.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00172	This music player has so much\nstorage space. It can hold a\nton of songs.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00173	Ugh, I'm so jealous... I should ask\nfor one this big sometime.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00174	There's a music player with an enviable amount\nof storage space.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00175	"Report: Safety Enhancements\nAccompanying the Security\nGate's Remote Operation."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00176	"Designing a Function to\nLink Surveillance Cameras\nand Door-Lock Controls for\nIndividual Rooms."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00177	I guess they're passionate about\nimproving security tech. Good\nthing, given all the research\nthat's kept here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00178	The security reports are signed by Ian Tyler.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00179	These must be Ian's. Something\ntells me the jacket is his style.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00180	A lab coat and a beige jacket are hung\non the rack.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00185	The J.C. Valley logo and numbers for each room\nare on the panel.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00186	Security must be pretty strict.\nThere are cameras everywhere.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00187	There's an active security camera installed\nnear the ceiling.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00189	Whoa, now that's a huge monitor.\nI've never seen one this big.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00190	I wonder if this can be used for\nvideo conferences and sharing\ndocuments and stuff.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00191	There's a large monitor on the wall near the\nmeeting table.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00192	Looks like the remote control\nfor the big monitor. I wonder\nwhat it'll show if I turn it on.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00193	The remote control for the large monitor is\non the table.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00194	This table's shape is awesome!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00195	I bet I'd come up with some great\nideas if I attended a meeting at\na table like this.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00196	The meeting table has a sleek, streamlined, and\ninspiring shape to it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00197	These red and black chairs are\npretty cool. I wonder if Dad sits\nin these during meetings.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00198	But I can't really imagine Dad\nsitting still long enough to\nattend a meeting...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00199	Seven chairs surround the meeting table.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00200	Does this computer control the\nmonitor display?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00201	The computer on the desk controls what's\ndisplayed on the monitor.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00202	It's great that they have fresh\nwater so conveniently placed.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00203	But a meeting that goes so long\nyou need a water break sounds\nlike a total slog...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00204	The water cooler is full of mineral water.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00205	Looks like you can have coffee\nduring meetings too.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00206	I bet the free coffee is the real\nreason Dad took a job here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00207	There's a coffee maker that grinds and brews\nfresh beans.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00208	Paper, pens, box cutters... Looks\nlike typical office supplies.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00209	The cabinet is stocked with office supplies.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00211	It won't open. Must be locked.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00212	The door won't open. I guess it's\nstill locked down.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc1_00213	The door is locked and won't open.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00225	Now this is a nice audio setup.\nLooks pretty high quality. I bet\nit sounds great.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00226	Whoever uses this room must be\npretty into music.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00227	The shelf contains some sleek, high-quality\naudio equipment.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00228	I always imagined a lab as having\nbig thick books and documents\nlaying all around, but this room's\npractically empty.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00229	The light doesn't turn on. Doesn't\nseem like anyone uses this.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00230	The light on the shelf doesn't turn on.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00231	This painting is similar to the\none in Ryan's cottage.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00232	I think it's supposed to be a river,\nbut it's hard to tell...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00233	The abstract painting uses unique brush\nstrokes to depict the flow of water.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00238	The J.C. Valley logo and numbers for each room\nare on the panel.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00239	There's a security camera\nhere too.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00240	There's an active security camera installed\nnear the ceiling.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00242	What a big table. All these chairs\nmust mean it's used for meetings.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00243	I bet they talk about all sorts of\ncomplicated science stuff while\nwatching the monitor.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00244	Six chairs are placed around a large table.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00245	A tea set? I guess they have a\ntea time during the day.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00246	I could go for some tea, but now\nprobably isn't the best time.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00247	There's a tea set by the large table.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00248	These awards are all\ndifferent shapes.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00249	Some amazing things must have\ncome out of this lab to have\nreceived so many.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00250	There's a variety of trophies and plaques.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00251	I had no idea they received\nan award for Lake Juliet's\nsecurity system. Pretty cool.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00252	Hold on... If the security around\nLake Juliet is so good, how come\nmy stolen bag is still missing?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00253	"Grand Prize in Next Generation Industry\nTechnology Security System Designed for\nTourist Destinations."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00254	Let's see what books they have.\nElectrical engineering, computer\nscience, and...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00255	Quantum theory? I don't even\nknow where I'd begin.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00256	Various academic books are lined up.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00257	Physiology, genetic engineering,\nneuroscience... These books all\nlook super advanced.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00258	Even their titles are over\nmy head.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00259	Various academic books are lined up.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00264	The J.C. Valley logo and numbers for each room\nare on the panel.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00265	This camera's just like the one\nby the lakeshore. I guess they\nneeded some in here too.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00266	There's an active security camera installed\nnear the ceiling.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00267	I wonder if I can use this\ncomputer to learn more\nabout the lab.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00268	Nope. Should've figured it would\nbe locked.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00269	The PC is locked.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00279	Is this Sofia's notepad? Maybe\nshe wrote her plans down.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00280	No luck... Not finding any hints.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00281	There's a notepad with a stylish design.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00286	The J.C. Valley logo and numbers for each room\nare on the panel.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00373	So they have security cameras\nin the lab too?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00374	There's a security camera\nattached to the wall.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00293	I see no rhyme or reason to how\nthese books were placed...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00294	What do they do when they want\na specific book? Look through\nevery single one?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00295	The shelf of technical books and novels is\nnot organized in the slightest.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00296	What's this supposed to be? Was\nsomeone in the middle of making\nsome sort of device?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00297	Various circuit boards and other parts are\nscattered on the shelf.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00298	These boxes looks heavy. They're\nfull of parts I've never seen\nbefore.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00299	These boxes are packed with various pieces\nof equipment.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00310	This must be for coffee.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00311	There's an electric kettle for boiling water.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00312	Something was left on the floor\nafter that search.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00313	I guess I kinda get why Dad's\nroom is so messy.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00314	Maybe I'll help him tidy up once\nthis is all over.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00321	The J.C. Valley logo and numbers for each room\nare on the panel.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00376	This camera's just like the one by the lakeshore.\nMust be the same model.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00375	The security camera resembles the other\ncameras positioned around the lake.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00324	So, the room is a total mess... But\nthe trash can is clean. Got it.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00325	If you can keep this clean, you\nshould be able to keep the rest\nof the room clean too.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00326	The trash can is empty.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00329	Wrinkled collar? Definitely Dad's.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00330	Does he own an iron? I should\nmake sure he knows how to\nuse one.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00331	Richard's coat is hanging on the stand.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00377	I've seen this before... Was it\nwhen I was here with Mom?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00378	The blueprints for the prototype ANOTHER are\non the desk.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00333	These papers are kept so neat.\nWhoever sits here must have a\nreal keen eye for detail.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00334	I love a good organizational tool,\nbut even I'm not this neat.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00335	Various notes and envelopes are neatly\norganized inside the organizer.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00336	I love having flowers around.\nJust seeing them improves\nmy mood.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00337	It must be tough for flowers to\nbe stuck in a windowless room.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00338	The vase contains colorful flowers.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00339	Easy to see, easy to retrieve.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00340	The pinnacle of organizational\npractices!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00341	The documents are neatly sorted in the stand.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00342	This is the main unit of a\ncomputer, right? Looks like\nit's being disassembled.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00343	Is it being repaired, or is it part\nof some experiment?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00344	Circuit boards have been removed from the\ncomputer and sorted.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00345	"pH Levels of Lake Water\nSamples" and "List of Impurities\nFound in Samples."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00346	Are these the results of the lake\ninvestigation? I didn't know the\nlab was looking into that too.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00347	The whiteboard contains data pertaining\nto water quality.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00348	"Spec on Optical Water Quality\nObservation Devices, by\nDr. Richard Robins."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00349	Are these instructions for the\nwater-quality testing feature\nof the DAS?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00350	Spec on Optical Water Quality Observation\nDevices, by Dr. Richard Robins
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00351	Why is there a fishing rod here?\nThere are lures and everything.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00352	Whoever sits here must be one\nof Dad's fishing friends.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00353	There's a well-kept fishing rod leaning against\nthe desk.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00354	Whoa, Lake Juliet is featured in\na special edition!
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00355	I had no idea the lake was famous\nenough to be featured in a\nfishing magazine. That's pretty\ncool.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00356	Bass Fishing Monthly:\nLake Juliet Special Edition
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00357	It's a CD containing the results\nof the water-quality report.\nLet's see what it found...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00358	"Lake water, tea, Cool POP"?\nWas he actually investigating\nsoft drinks too?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00359	There's a disc labeled "Water-Quality\nInvestigation Results."
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00360	Three lab coats and three desks.\nI guess three people share this\noffice space.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00361	There are three lab coats on the coatrack.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00366	The J.C. Valley logo and numbers for each room\nare on the panel.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00367	This camera's just like the one\nby the lakeshore. I guess they\nneeded some in here too.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00368	There's an active security camera installed\nnear the ceiling.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00370	I think I'll be able to get through\nthe security as long as I have\nthe RAS and DAS.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00371	Hold on... Did Mom know this\nmight happen? Is that why she\nregistered my information with\nthe RAS?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc2_00372	The security device is unlocked.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc3_00036	I wonder what's inside. It's so\nblue, and the way it shimmers...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc3_00037	No way it's just normal water...\nIs this liquid memory?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc3_00038	The liquid that fills the tank to the brim\nshimmers a pale blue.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc3_00042	A security camera? I wonder\nwhere they're watching from.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc3_00043	I need to get out of here before\nSofia catches me again.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc3_00044	That security camera sure came\nin handy.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc3_00045	Without it, I wouldn't have seen\nDad had been caught, much less\nwhere he was being held.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc3_00046	A security camera is attached to a white pole\nin the ceiling.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc3_00047	That light looks similar to the\nlight from Mom's pendant. Could\nthey be related somehow?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc3_00054	A stream of shimmering liquid is flowing\nout of the building and into the lake.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc3_00048	Why would someone decide to\nbuild laboratory at the bottom\nof a lake?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc3_00049	There must have been something\nthat required it...
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc3_00050	I wonder how Dad's doing. Ugh,\nI can't see from here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc3_00051	Why would Sofia do something\nlike this to Dad and me?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc3_00052	What's she and her\npartner planning?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r6jc3_00053	There are several large tanks behind the thick\nacrylic window.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r7are_00026	What a beautiful spring. This is\nthe source of Lake Juliet?
ACR_Obj_flavor_r7are_00036	The bottom of the spring can be seen as the\nmorning light shines through the water.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r7are_00028	The spring water forms a\nwaterfall. That's amazing.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r7are_00029	It's so beautiful how the mist\nsparkles in the light.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r7are_00037	The water gushing from the spring forms a\nwaterfall which flows into the lake.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r7are_00030	This must be one of the cameras\nGina was talking about.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r7are_00031	Ryan must have watched the\nlake from here.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r7are_00032	There's a security camera capable of serving\nas a remote ANOTHER.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r7are_00033	Good thing there was still a\nusable boat at the boathouse.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r7are_00034	Ryan's waiting for me. Let's go.
ACR_Obj_flavor_r7are_00035	The boat is tied securely\nso it doesn't drift away.

AC1_Characters_00118	  Tomorrow is my 14th birthday, but I feel\nhorrible. It's all because of this package I got\nfrom my dad, who I was told died 11 years ago.\nAll that was inside was a note telling me to come\nto Blood Edward Island to celebrate my birthday,\nand this thing that looks like a game system. I\ndon't know what to think. It's just so random.\n  Jessica told me I should go, and I reluctantly\nagreed. But I have no idea why...\n  My mind's going a mile a minute. My dad is\nalive? Seriously? So he didn't die, he abandoned\nme. And now he wants to celebrate my birthday,\njust out of the blue? Why would I possibly want\nto spend my birthday with him?\n  I don't think I'll be able to even force a smile\nwhen I meet him, let alone act happy.
AC1_Characters_00119	  Jessica disappeared after leaving the dock, and\nthen I stumbled into a graveyard while looking\nfor her. And then, believe it or not, I met a ghost.\n  His name is D. It sounds like he lost almost all\nof his memories from when he was alive. I didn't\nknow what to say when he asked me to help him\nrecover his memories, but he agreed to help me\nlook for Jessica. So I decided to work with him.\n  He must have been so lonely, with no memories\nand no one to talk to for almost 60 years. Even I\nprefer to have someone around rather than being\nall alone... Even now, when that someone\nhappens to be a ghost.\n  Anyway, we were able to get into this mansion\nthanks to D remembering the secret to the\ndoor. I think we make a good team.
AC1_Characters_00120	  D's been slowly piecing together his memories\nas we explore the mansion looking for Jessica.\nIt's great news. At this rate, I bet he'll remember\neverything in no time. We'll make sure to get\nall your memories back, D!\n  But man, there sure are a lot of weird devices\nin this place... Like the butler's silver tableware,\nor Frannie's dolls. I guess Lawrence, the head of\nthe family, was pretty into this stuff.\n  After playing the piano and finding Frannie's\nand D's shells, this guy came out of nowhere...\nIt was Dad. Even though I haven't seen him in\n11 years, and even though there's like, a million\nthings I wanted to say to him, my mind went\ntotally blank. I couldn't say anything.
AC1_Characters_00121	  I used the W key I got from Dad to find the last\ntwo ANOTHER keys in the west wing. D helped\nme solve the moon-coin puzzle, and the radio,\ntoo. I'm so glad he's here with me.\n  We figured out that the combination to\nThomas's briefcase is D's birthday. I was so happy\nfor him. It's proof that his dad really loved him.\n  Meanwhile, as soon as we gave the ANOTHER\nkeys to my dad, his attitude completely changed.\nHe disappeared, leaving me all alone. Does that\nmean he doesn't love me? I have a hard time\nbelieving such a cold person is my dad... It makes\nme wish I never came to this island to begin with.\n  I'm worried about D, and I would love to help\nhim... But I want to go home as soon as we\nfind Jessica.
AC1_Characters_00122	  D floated off somewhere right after my dad left,\nleaving me all alone.\n  I wound up in the mansion's courtyard while\nlooking for D. Colorful flowers are blooming all\naround the fountain. Could it be that my dad,\nas cold as he treated me, has been taking care\nof these flowers? I can't even begin to imagine.\n  I found a sprout key in the fountain and used it\nto get into the Silver Bird Room. D was in\nthere. He told me about when Thomas was killed,\nand it brought up memories of my own... I\ncouldn't stop myself from crying. I'll never forget\nD's kindness as he stayed by my side, looking\nover me without a word.\n  But the thing I was most happy about is we\nfound Jessica! Bill had handcuffed her in the\nwine cellar. She's still stuck down there, even\nnow... Hold on, Jessica. We'll come back for you.
AC1_Characters_00123	  We needed both sprout keys to unlock\nLawrence's room. The keys to Henry's and\nThomas's rooms. Lawrence must have hoped\nthat the two would always be close to one\nanother. Maybe he was trying to make up for\nhow he wasn't able to connect with Leonard...\n  There was a hidden door under the desk in\nLawrence's room that led to a room on the 1st\nfloor. And in that hidden room, there were stairs\nthat led even farther down.\n  I've solved lots of puzzles up to now, and now\nI'm getting kind of excited... Somewhere along\nthe way, working with D to come up with all\nthese solutions has become really fun.\n  But it does make me wonder what could\npossibly motivate someone to make so\nmany puzzles...
AC1_Characters_00124	  The person locked in the room in the lab was\nRichard Robins... My dad. I finally met my\nreal dad.\n  Looking at his face, hearing his voice, it helped\nme remember that this man has been the one\ncalling my name in my dreams. I smelled\nsomething sweet when I hugged him... It was\nthe scent of my favorite chocolate.\n  Dad suffered so much, thinking he was the one\nwho killed Mom. But thanks to the ANOTHER,\nhe regained his real memories. And the one\nwho implanted the fake memories... Bill... He\nwas trying to steal the ANOTHER. I will never\nforgive him for what he did to Dad, let alone\nto Jessica.\n  How could he bring himself to do these things?
AC1_Characters_00125	  D looked so happy as he moved on, after finally\nregaining all his memories.\n  So long, D. And thank you. I have some sad\nmemories, but thanks to you, I finally learned\nthe truth. You were the only person I could share\nmy true feelings with.\n  I'll never forget what happened today... The day\nbefore my 14th birthday. Meeting D, reuniting\nwith my dad, what I remembered about Mom...\n  Dad told me that Mom gave me my middle\nname. It means "beautiful moon." Thanks for\nthe awesome name, Mom.\n  And then he gave me Mom's pendant as a\nbirthday present. I'll never take it off. As long\nas I have it, I'll feel her presence watching\nover me.
AC1_Characters_00215	Jessica
AC1_Characters_00126	Jessica Robins
AC1_Characters_00127	  My aunt Jessica is super nice. She's raised me\never since Dad dropped me at her doorstep 11\nyears ago. She can be strict, but I chalk that up\nto her being a teacher. And we do get into fights\nsometimes... But I know she always has my best\ninterests in mind.\n  Whenever I'm feeling down, she'll hang out with\nme until I start feeling better. She's like a mother\nto me, and I love her for it.\n  I wouldn't have even come here today had she\nnot encouraged me to. She says I should trust\nmy dad, but that isn't easy when I can't even\nremember his face.
AC1_Characters_00128	  I was running after Jessica... When I got close\nto the mansion, I heard a scream. I'm sure it was\nher. Pushing my fears aside, I made it to the front\ndoor. That's where I found her favorite pair\nof glasses.\n  But why? What happened, Jessica?\n  I can't be scared. I need to look for her. She's\nall the family I have left and I love her. She has\nto be somewhere in the mansion...
AC1_Characters_00129	  We were able to get into the butler's room and\nthe art studio in the east wing using the E key\nwe found in the drawing room. And thanks to the\nkey we found in the butler's room, we were able\nto get into Frannie's room on the 2nd floor.\n  But still no sign of Jessica. Dad said he hasn't\nseen her, either. I'm beginning to wonder if she's\neven in this place.\n  I'm really starting to worry. Where are you,\nJessica?
AC1_Characters_00130	  I must have seen just about every inch of this\nplace by now, but still no Jessica. I pushed\nthrough my fear of the dark to search the library,\nwhere all I had was a candle to light my way. I\novercame the soot of a dirty old fireplace to\nsearch the gloomy hidden room beyond it.\n  And yet, my good-for-nothing Dad, who said\nhe'd help look for Jessica, does nothing but go\non and on about his precious research! He's left\nme no choice but to keep looking on my own.\n  Jessica, please be safe, wherever you are...
AC1_Characters_00131	  I finally found my dear aunt Jessica! I'm glad\nshe's OK, but what kind of monster is Bill,\nlocking people up in underground rooms?!\n  She still can't move because of the stupid\nhandcuffs, so I want to rescue her ASAP...but she\nsaid not to worry about her, that I should focus on\nfinding Dad. But why? He's the guy who cares\nmore about his research than his own family! But,\nknowing Jessica, she probably—no, definitely—\nwon't move until I bring Dad, so I guess I have\nto look for him now.
AC1_Characters_00132	  I sure hope Jessica is OK. When I found her\nshe was more worried about Dad than herself.\nDon't know why—he only thinks about his\nresearch and doesn't give his family a second\nthought...\n  Anyway, I barely know Dad, so it's hard for me\nto do what Jessica says and "believe in him." But\nI'll do what she wants and try to find him. Then\nwe can have a good conversation and then save\nJessica together!
AC1_Characters_00133	  Thank you, Jessica! I finally found my real dad.\nI'm glad I trusted you and looked for him.\n  I know you're all alone and probably worried,\nbut Dad and I are coming to rescue you right\naway, so just hold on a little longer!
AC1_Characters_00134	  Dad rescued Jessica, and I finally got to give\nher a hug. I love her so much.\n  Seeing her same old smile, it was like my worries\nsorta melted away.\n  Jessica seemed sad when she heard about Bill.\nHe did terrible things to both her and Dad, but\nhe was still an old friend, so I guess it makes\nsense that she'd be sad. At least now it's all over.\nWe can finally go home, and bring Dad with us!\nI can't wait to celebrate my birthday tomorrow\nwith one of Jessica's cakes!
AC1_Characters_00216	Richard
AC1_Characters_00135	Richard Robins
AC1_Characters_00136	  The person locked up in the lab calls himself\nRichard Robins... Wait, really? I mean, my dad\nis supposed to be that guy I met in the Drawing\nRoom who is totally focused on his research... This\nguy claiming to be my dad out of nowhere is just\ntoo hard to believe... But, when he called me by\nmy name, the dream I keep having suddenly\npopped into my head. It was the same voice of\nthe one who finds me sobbing in a closet, and he\nputs his hands out to me. So yeah, this man is my\nreal dad.
AC1_Characters_00137	  I rescued Dad, who was locked away in the lab,\nand was finally able to reunite with my real father.\nWhen he regained his original memories with\nANOTHER, I found out what happened that day\nat the same time. Dad didn't kill Mom! I didn't\nwant to see Mom dying, but now I'm glad I found\nthe courage to do it.\n  Now that he has his memories back and knows\nthe truth, Dad destroyed the ANOTHER to keep\nit from Bill. He kept his promise to Mom...\nThanks, Dad.
AC1_Characters_00138	  Dad seemed really surprised that Bill, his friend\nand research partner, would betray him and Mom.\nI guess he thought he knew Bill, so he was sad\nto find out the truth.\n  Still, I'm glad that we know. He got his true\nmemories back, and he was able to keep his\npromise to Mom that he'd protect ANOTHER.\n  I feel like what D said is perfect for Dad:\n"Even though facing the truth can be hard,\nin the end, it's always for the best."
AC1_Characters_00217	Sayoko
AC1_Characters_00139	Sayoko Robins
AC1_Characters_00140	  Mom died when I was three. I know she was a\nscientist like Dad, but what kind of person was\nshe really? Jessica says I have Mom's eyes, but\nI don't remember anything about her at all...\n  I was told that my dad died along with my mom,\nso if he's alive, maybe she is too? I'd love to\nsee her again. I want to know everything\nabout her.
AC1_Characters_00141	  I found a picture of me as a baby in the art\nstudio, and I think the person holding me was\nMom! It finally makes sense—she was the one\nwho always showed up in my dream. She has such\na kind face, and now I'll never forget it again.\nI'm keeping this picture. Who's gonna tell me I\ncan't have the only picture of my mother I've\never seen?
AC1_Characters_00142	  I found a newspaper article about Mom's death,\nand it matched up with the scene I always see in\nmy dream. Maybe it's not a dream at all? The\narticle also said Dad was a suspect in the murder,\nbut that can't be right!\n  Until now, I thought I wanted to know\neverything about Mom, no matter what. Now...\nI don't want to know this. Dad says he's not the\nkiller, but I don't feel like I can trust anybody\nanymore.
AC1_Characters_00143	   Jessica told me a little more about what\nhappened to Mom and Dad being a suspect.\nShe says I should believe in him, but how can I\ndo that when he won't even look at me?\n  What should I do, Mom?
AC1_Characters_00144	  My real dad, the one that Mom loved, is a good\nperson. He loves me, and Jessica, and Mom. He's\nnot perfect, but you have to love the whole\nperson, flaws and all.\n  It was sad and scary to watch Mom die, but I'm\nglad we know that Dad didn't kill her. He also\nkept his promise to keep ANOTHER away from\nthe wrong hands, so you can rest easy, Mom.
AC1_Characters_00145	  Now I know everything about what happened to\nMom that day. Dad was heartbroken when he\nfound out that Bill was the one who shot her,\nbut I'm glad we know the truth.\n  Thank you for protecting me, Mom. I wish you\ncould be here with me and we could just be\ntalking and laughing together. You've moved\non to whatever's next, but I'll always carry a\nbit of you in my heart.
AC1_Characters_00146	D
AC1_Characters_00147	  Meeting D was one of the scariest things that's\never happened to me. He just APPEARED in\nfront of me, floating, upside down, and see-\nthrough! How could I not freak out?!\n  Apparently I'm the first person who's ever been\nable to see D, and he was really happy about\nthat. As happy as ghosts can get, anyway.\n  He can't really remember anything except\n(part of) his name, and I guess that's why he\nhasn't been able to move on to heaven or\nwhatever. He's been alone on this island for 57\nyears, and that's one of the saddest things I've\never heard. I'd love to help him recover his\nmemories, but I have no idea how.
AC1_Characters_00148	  Just when I was about to give up on opening the\ndoor to the mansion, D appeared again. It seems\nlike maybe being around me helps his memories\ncome back. That's how we got past the door—\nas we were talking, he suddenly remembered\ncoming to the island with his father. After that,\nwe were able to figure out the door knockers and\nget inside.\n  I'm not scared of D at all anymore. He's just a\nnice ghost that needs help, so I asked him to\ncome along. I also didn't want to be alone, so\nhaving a friend is nice. A ghost friend—that's\nlike the coolest thing that's happened to me.
AC1_Characters_00149	  D seems to be remembering all sorts of stuff as\nwe look around the mansion. There was a butler\nwho took care of him, and a little girl he was\nfriends with. Weird that this all happened almost\n60 years ago...\n  When I see how excited D is to open every\ndoor, looking for new memories, I'm glad he\ncame along with me. And without his help, I\nwouldn't have gotten nearly so far!\n  Most of all, I was glad D was there when I\nmet up with my father. If I'd been alone, I might\nhave just run away.
AC1_Characters_00150	  With D's help, I found the ANOTHER keys that\nwere hidden in the west wing. D also got a\nbunch of his memories back, which is great.\n  The bag of his we found in the hidden room\ntriggered lots of memories for D. He looked so\nhappy to remember so much about himself and\nhis father! It sounds like Thomas was a really\nsweet dad who loved his kid a lot. Totally the\nopposite of mine.
AC1_Characters_00151	  D remembered his father being murdered. It\nwas in the Silver Bird Room, which is probably\nwhy he was too scared to get near that place.\nHe looked so sad, staring down at the\nbloodstained carpet.\n  I know how he feels so much that it hurts.
AC1_Characters_00152	   In Lawrence's room, D remembered coming to\nsee his great-grandfather when he saw the\npainting of the three Edward men. Thomas was\ncrying as Lawrence held his hand... This place\nhas a lot of memories for D, even if they're not\nall happy ones.
AC1_Characters_00153	  We found a hidden staircase in the room under\nLawrence's room. D remembered going down\nthose stairs when he saw them, but not why. If he\ncould remember what happened then, I feel like\nhe would finally be free to move on.
AC1_Characters_00154	  There's a huge cave underneath the mansion.\nAfter seeing Thomas shot, D ran away from\nHenry, down to this cave, and fell off a cliff to his\ndeath.\n  The truth that he was searching for was sad and\nterrible, but having remembered everything, D\nwas finally able to pass beyond.\n  D was my secret friend. Neither Dad nor\nJessica could see him. I was surprised that the\ncaptain could, but not as surprised as D was.\nI didn't want to say goodbye, but then I saw how\nhappy he looked. I'm so glad to have met him.\nIf I hadn't, I would have been alone, and I'm sure\nI wouldn't have found my dad, and I couldn't\nhave saved Jessica. \n   Thank you so much, D. I hope you and your\nfather are happy together.
AC1_Characters_00155	Captain
AC1_Characters_00156	  The captain of the boat that took me and\nJessica to Blood Edward Island. I guess he's\nbeen doing this since before I was born, and he's\nreally good at it—I didn't get even a little seasick.\nHe looks a little gruff and scary, but he seems\nreally nice when you talk to him.\n  He told me some stuff about the island, and \nhow the people that used to live here had some\ntrouble. What is Dad doing here?
AC1_Characters_00157	  The captain came to pick us up from the island\nright on time. When we didn't show up at the\ndock, he got worried and came out to the cove\nto look for us, so I was right that he's a nice guy.\nYou'd never know it to look at him though!\n  But the most surprising thing was that he could\nsee D! And D was even more surprised than I\nwas. Nobody had seen him for 57 years, so it\nwas a shock that an old guy like that could. I\nthink the captain has more going on than you\ncan see, you know?
AC1_Characters_00158	Richard Robins
AC1_Characters_00159	  I got a letter, along with a weird device, from\nRichard Robins, my father. But are they really\nfrom Dad? I'd always heard he died 11 years\nago with Mom.\n  Apparently the device is something Dad made,\nand I'm the only one who can use it. Why would\nhe send me this?\n  I came to this "Blood Edward Island" he\nmentioned in the letter, but I don't remember\nanything about him or what he looks like.\n  I wonder if he'll recognize me...
AC1_Characters_00160	  Dad was supposed to meet us at the dock, but\nhe never showed. Who invites you to a weird\nisland and doesn't even show up?! He probably\njust changed his mind about wanting to meet me.\nJessica went on ahead, so I'm all alone, just\nwaiting to be killed by falling rocks or something,\nand it's all Dad's fault. He's probably just hanging\nout in the mansion or something. Jerk.
AC1_Characters_00161	  I met Dad. He's really tall and hugs hard. He\nsmells like cigarettes, which I didn't remember\nat all. Maybe it's just that 11 years is too long,\nbut I feel weird, like my heart can't catch up\nto reality. It seemed really sudden—one minute\nis normal, and the next I've met my dad. I was\nso nervous, I forgot to say any of the things I\nmeant to, but I've finally met him!
AC1_Characters_00162	  Dad took the ANOTHER keys and disappeared\nsomewhere. He didn't seem super happy to\nsee me, even though it's been so long. And he\nhasn't even looked for Jessica, so I guess his\nresearch is more important than either of us.\n  Is this guy really my father? He seems so cold,\nand I found a newspaper article saying that he\nwas a suspect in Mom's murder, so I really don't\nknow what to think.
AC1_Characters_00163	  Where did Dad go? I don't really even want to\nsee him, but I need to take him with me to\nrescue Jessica.\n  There's a big metal door in the courtyard across\nfrom the door he left through, so he probably\nwent through that.\n  Also...there sure are a lot of flowers in the\ncourtyard—was Dad taking care of them? He\ndoesn't seem like the type.
AC1_Characters_00164	  I made it to the other side of the door that I\nthought Dad must have gone through, but he\nwasn't there. I did find a hidden staircase that\nleads even further underground though. I bet\nDad is down there somewhere. I don't know\nwhat I'll find, and I'm a bit scared, but I can't\nlet that stop me! I've got to find Dad and rescue\nJessica! And I still have D with me, so I'm sure\nI'll be OK.
AC1_Characters_00165	Bill
AC1_Characters_00166	  The person who I thought was my dad was\nactually some awful guy he used to work with\nnamed Bill!\n  He was tricking me to get me to look for the\nANOTHER keys from Dad, and to steal\nANOTHER for himself. I guess the bright side is\nthat this guy isn't my actual father, thankfully.
AC1_Characters_00167	  Bill faked being my father to trick me into\ngiving him the ANOTHER keys and to steal the\ndata for it. He's responsible for this whole thing,\nincluding locking Jessica in an underground\nroom, and planting false memories in Dad's\nhead. I hate him so much.
AC1_Characters_00168	Bill Edward
AC1_Characters_00169	  Bill fell off a cliff in the cave and disappeared\ninto the water below. Dad tried to save him—\nwhy didn't Bill grab his hand? I'll never forgive\nhim for killing Mom, but it would have been\nbetter if he'd had a chance to atone for what\nhe did.\n  When it looked like Bill was going to shoot us,\nD tried to stop him, and for just a moment it\nseemed like Bill could see him.\n  After Bill died, I found an old picture in a\nnotebook on his desk, showing him and Frannie.\nI guess Frannie was Bill's mom. Maybe he could\nsee D because they were related?
AC1_Characters_00218	Frannie
AC1_Characters_00170	Frannie Edward
AC1_Characters_00171	  Frannie was D's friend. She lived in this\nmansion and was really good at the piano. She\nalso nicknamed him "D." I would love to have\nknown her and heard her play music.
AC1_Characters_00172	  The drawing of Frannie in the art studio was\nobviously really old, but D talks about his\nmemories of her like they just happened.\nLooking around here, it's easy to see that\nwhatever happened happened a long time ago.\n  It's amazing to think that D was friends with\nFrannie decades ago, and now I'm friends\nwith him.\n  I was glad we were able to put Frannie's\nhomemade dolls back together and line them\nup as a family again. It's good for families to\nbe together.
AC1_Characters_00173	  I guess Frannie and D were really close, and\nplayed together all the time. They hid a "treasure"\nof shells and stuff from the island inside the\npiano. There were also some drawings on a\ntable in the study that were done in invisible ink.\nI even found the hidden fireplace room because\nof a secret note in invisible ink that Frannie left\nfor D!\n  I'll bet they would have liked to know that their\nfun little secrets would be useful to someone\ndecades in the future.
AC1_Characters_00174	  I found an old notebook in the underground\ncave with a photo in it. The photo showed a\ngrown-up Frannie with her little son, Bill. So\nFrannie was his mother! She looks so happy in\nthe picture—I'll bet she was a great mom.
AC1_Characters_00219	Henry
AC1_Characters_00175	Henry Edward
AC1_Characters_00176	  Henry's father died when he was little, so he\ngrew up in the mansion with Thomas. In his\njournal, Wells wrote that Henry was "wise and\nstrong." And Henry was also a super talented\nartist! I'll bet Frannie was proud to have him\nas a father.
AC1_Characters_00177	  Henry grew up with a wonderful family, and was\nbecoming an artist like he'd always dreamed\nwhen he lost his right arm in the war. He couldn't\nhold a brush after that, and must have been so\nsad not to be able to paint anymore.\n  I'm sure it's thanks to the support of his family\nand his own efforts that he was able to get just\nas good with his left hand as he had been with\nhis right. Frannie used to brag about her father\nto D.\n  Even so, Marie wrote in her farewell letter that\nHenry had "changed." It must have been so\nshocking for him when people he loved died...
AC1_Characters_00178	  The Silver Bird Room is where Thomas died\nafter Henry shot him. The room was sealed up\nand no one has been there since. Did they just\nnot want to go in there anymore? Maybe they\ndidn't want anyone to touch it again? I guess I'll\nnever know.\n  I'll also never know why one member of a family\nwould kill another. It seems like the brothers got\nalong really well, so what went wrong?
AC1_Characters_00179	  Henry chased D to the underground cave, but\nnot because D saw him shoot Thomas, but\nbecause he knew D had a bad heart and wanted\nto calm him down. It must have broken Henry's\nheart after killing Thomas to lose D as well...
AC1_Characters_00220	Thomas
AC1_Characters_00180	Thomas Edward
AC1_Characters_00181	  Thomas's father died when he was little, and\nhe grew up in the mansion with Henry. Reading\nWells's journal helped D remember that Thomas\nwas his father. He didn't seem very happy with\nthe memory though...\n  In his journal, Wells wrote that Thomas was\n"sweet and honest." I get that was true when he\nwas a kid. When he didn't live in the mansion\nanymore and his grandfather got sick, he brought\nD to visit. I guess the sweet part of him never\nchanged.
AC1_Characters_00182	   The combination to the lock on Thomas's\nbriefcase from the hidden library in the study\nturned out to be D's birthday! I think lots of\npeople use a loved one's birthday for stuff like\nthis, but it sure made D happy to know his dad\nthought of him like that.\n   Along with the ANOTHER key, we found a\nbunch of stuff that was important to Thomas.\nHe was carrying his most important things\nlocked behind the birthday of his son.
AC1_Characters_00183	  When Lawrence got sick, Thomas came back to\nthe island with D and was murdered in the Silver\nBird Room. By his one and only brother, Henry.\nI can't imagine how Thomas felt—was it shock?\nSadness? Or maybe the worst part was knowing\nthat D would be all alone once he was gone.
AC1_Characters_00184	  Thomas was shot by his brother Henry. It must\nhave filled him with such terrible regret to die\nand leave behind D, who had a weak heart.\n  I don't know what happened between them, or\nwhat the reasons could have been, but it sure is\nsad, thinking of someone killing another member\nof their family...\n  I hope they're all together now, somewhere\nbetter than this island.
AC1_Characters_00221	Lawrence
AC1_Characters_00185	Lawrence Edward
AC1_Characters_00186	  D's great-grandfather, and the owner of this\nmansion. D came to this island with his father\nto visit this man when he got sick. I've only seen\nhim in a painting, but he looked a little scary.\nLike, you're getting your portrait painted—why\ndo you look so angry about it? Why didn't the\nartist ask him to smile?
AC1_Characters_00187	  Lawrence took in his grandchildren, Henry and\nThomas, after his son, Leonard, died. He seems\nto have raised them well, according to Wells's\njournal. It seems like he was kind of a grumpy\nguy, but maybe to the kids he was just a\nsweet grandpa.
AC1_Characters_00188	  There are lots of strange devices and hidden\nsecrets all around this mansion, like moving\nbookshelves and hidden rooms. Oh, and the\nweird door-knocker too! Did Lawrence build\nall these to make Henry and Thomas happy?\nIf so, he was an awesome grandfather.
AC1_Characters_00189	  Lawrence's room was decorated with lots of\nportraits. In the one with him and the grown-up\nHenry and Thomas, he still had the same grouchy\nlook he had in the one from the foyer, but I bet\nthat was just an act. I think he was super happy\nto be there with his two favorite people in the\nwhole, wide world.\n  I'll bet he loved looking at those portraits of\nthe people he loved so much.
AC1_Characters_00222	Wells
AC1_Characters_00190	William Wells
AC1_Characters_00191	  I'm sure Wells, with his organization and\nnatural cleanliness, was a great butler. It also\nseems like he was a kind person, who treated\nD just as well as the adults. It must have been\na lot of work to take care of a house as big as\nthis one though.\n  It also seems like Wells was pretty careful about\nwho came into his room, maybe because he had\nkeys to the rest of the rooms in there. He was a\ndevoted guy.
AC1_Characters_00192	  Wells loved this silver tableware. I'll bet he\nchose most of the furniture and silver in the\nmansion. He did a great job too—the lamps\nand candle holders are all gorgeous, but very\nuseable. I like antiques myself, so everywhere I\nlook, I see great pieces. Pity no one's taken care\nof them all this time, so they're all dull and dusty.\nWells would hate to see it like this.
AC1_Characters_00223	Leonard
AC1_Characters_00193	Leonard Edward
AC1_Characters_00194	  Thomas and Henry's father. Wells wrote in his\njournal that Leonard died of an illness. He must\nhave felt terrible leaving his kids orphaned when\nthey were so little. Wells also mentioned that\nthey "finally learned of his whereabouts," so I\nguess Leonard left the island at some point and\ndidn't tell them where he was going.\n  I don't know what happened with Leonard, but\nit seems like Lawrence took his sons in and\nraised them well, so I'm glad for that.
AC1_Characters_00224	Marie
AC1_Characters_00196	Marie Edward
AC1_Characters_00197	  The letter we found in Frannie's parents' room\nwas a farewell from Marie to Henry. I guess\nHenry changed a lot after Lawrence died, and\nMarie couldn't help him feel any better. But I\nthink she left for Frannie's sake, to get her away\nfrom this island. But it must have been hard for\nthis family that all loved each other to be\nseparated like that...
AC1_Characters_00198	  The farewell letter we found in Frannie's parents'\nroom from Marie to Henry showed how sad and\npainful this all was for Marie. But there was also\na big hint in the letter for finding the key to the\nSilver Bird Room. "You threw the sprout key in\nthe fountain." This letter was the reason I was\nable to find D.

AC1_Richard_memo_00033	#01 My First Attempt at Woodworking
AC1_Richard_memo_00034	 A week has passed since my clumsy hands took up a saw and hammer, but I finally\n completed my new stool. My measurements may have been a little off, but it's not\n bad for a first attempt. I'll take it to the cliff overlooking the sea next chance I get.\n\n It's a little wobbly.\n Must be the ground that's uneven.\n Well, it's a nice feature. Sitting on this stool that I built myself, looking out at the\n sea, my body rocking in time to the sounds of the waves... The wobbling will help\n me keep a rhythm.\n\n I doubt I'll even notice it after a while. I'll get used to it in no time!\n But am I going too easy on it? I made this stool by hand, so maybe my judgment\n is clouded. What if Bill or someone sat on it? Would they have a different take?\n\n P.S.\n Sure, I worked on this stool in my spare time around developing the ANOTHER,\n but the fact remains it took me an entire week to make a simple stool... In the\n realm of DIY, I'm clearly still a novice.\n Should the day come when I live with Ashley again, I'll have to really ramp up my\n woodworking skills.
AC1_Richard_memo_00035	#02 Lawrence Edward, the Patriarch
AC1_Richard_memo_00036	 It seems that the late patriarch of this mansion, Lawrence Edward, was a deeply\n distrusting man.\n \n He found gold on this desolate island and grew the company he established in the\n span of a single generation. He seems to have viewed everyone who approached\n him as a thief who wanted only his money, so much so that he forbade anyone\n outside the family from entering the mansion. What's more, he took measures\n to guard his property from intruders by placing mechanisms all around the\n mansion.\n\n I believe his distrust of others had a negative impact on his family as well. There\n is, for some reason, not a single mention of his wife anywhere in this mansion.\n There's not even a trace of a grave belonging to her in the graveyard. I have no\n real evidence to suggest this, but my theory is Lawrence's wife fell out of love with\n him—this man who cast suspicion on everyone—and left the island for good\n after having his child.\n\n Lawrence's reward for amassing such vast wealth was to be tortured by the distrust\n of others, leaving him a lonely man who had lost the love of his family.\n\n However, it appears he was able to keep his heart open to at least one person:\n the butler who served his family. And judging from the journal in the butler's\n room, it seems it was a mutual and unwavering loyalty.
AC1_Richard_memo_00037	#03 The Scenery Across the Sea
AC1_Richard_memo_00038	 As I enjoyed the breeze off the water, gazing lazily out at the horizon, I recalled\n the beautiful springtime scenery of Sayoko's hometown in Japan.\n\n I haven't visited Japan in over 10 years. The last time I went, it was with Sayoko to\n tell her parents of our marriage. During the flight to Haneda, I caught a rather\n rare sight: Sayoko looking nervous.\n\n No doubt her mind was occupied with thoughts of what she'd say to her parents.\n This was her first visit home in quite a while, after all, and on top of that she was\n going to reveal such big news.\n\n In an attempt to calm her nerves, I held her hand and asked her to tell me about\n her hometown.\n\n She told me about a river near her family home. In spring, the cherry-blossom\n trees along its banks bloom, creating such a beautiful scene.\n\n Even now, all these years later, I can see the smile on her face as she talked about\n those trees. And the next day I walked beside her beneath those cherry blossoms,\n on my way to meet her parents for the first time.\n\n I've always wanted to return to Japan, but it has not yet been in the cards. But I'll\n make it back someday... And I'll walk the path beneath the cherry blossoms that\n Sayoko loved so much.
AC1_Richard_memo_00039	#04 Tarnished Teddy Bear
AC1_Richard_memo_00040	 Living in this mansion has been like living in a time capsule. Each room is\n untouched by time. And as I use these rooms in my day-to-day life, I find\n myself developing an interest in antique furniture.\n\n When I gaze upon the elaborate decor, when I feel the fine materials used in\n their construction—materials that have withstood the test of time—I think I must\n be feeling the same sense of elegance and high living once enjoyed by the\n Edward family. I'll sometimes catch myself wandering from room to room just\n to admire the furniture. One might even say I'm becoming an enthusiast.\n\n Yet, I have found it difficult to enjoy the child's room on the east side of the\n second floor. Looking at the dusty teddy bear or that small desk, my thoughts\n rush back to Ashley, and how I left her behind 11 years ago.\n\n Oh, Ashley... I want to see you just one more time. I have to imagine you don't\n even remember my face. You were just three years old at the time... I want to\n finish ANOTHER, and then see with my own eyes how you've grown.\n\n I feel as though I've been stuck in time myself, and only you can bring me back.
AC1_Richard_memo_00041	#05 Thoughts on my Father as a Father
AC1_Richard_memo_00042	 When I think of one day reuniting with Ashley, I sometimes find myself wondering\n what sort of father I should be. And in those moments, my thoughts immediately\n go to my own father, who died when I was 18.\n\n He worked as an importer, a line of business that took him all over the world.\n His sole focus in life was his work, so he was rarely home.\n\n But one day, in a move that surprised us all, he took my mother on a vacation to\n South America. But their plane crashed into the Pacific Ocean and I never saw\n my parents again.\n\n At the time, I couldn't understand my father's desire to bury himself in his work.\n How could he keep himself so busy that he neglects his family? And then one day,\n he was gone. But looking back... I've become exactly like him.\n\n If my father were still alive, what would he say to me? To see me with my head so\n buried in my research... What would he think of me?
AC1_Richard_memo_00043	#06 Hummingbirds
AC1_Richard_memo_00044	 From the door knockers, to tableware, to paintings, to sculptures in the fountain,\n a hummingbird motif permeates every corner of this mansion. The fact that there\n are so many hummingbird decorations indicates that Lawrence had a strong\n fixation on them.\n\n Hummingbirds can be a symbol of healing and love, and are apparently a popular\n motif in Native American cultures as well. I believe it's possible Lawrence included\n hummingbirds all throughout the mansion as an attempt to alleviate his loneliness.\n\n It reminds me of something Sayoko once told me.\n\n In Japan, the crane has long been associated with good fortune. Designs featuring\n this particular bird are very popular. Origami cranes are most popular as a means\n of making a wish. As such, those who wish for peace or a speedy recovery from\n illness will often make them in droves.\n\n So perhaps Lawrence's hummingbird decorations were made with a with a wish for\n peace in his own life.\n\n Sayoko taught me how to make origami cranes a long time ago. Maybe I should\n make a few and leave them around the mansion, with a wish that the departed\n may rest in peace.
AC1_Richard_memo_00045	#07 Coffee Preferences
AC1_Richard_memo_00046	 It would be impossible for me to live on this island, let alone carry out my\n research, without Bill's support. Since I'm ostensibly dead to the world, he\n regularly visits from the mainland to deliver goods critical to my survival.\n\n Such as coffee. It's crucial to my ability to unwind.\n\n However, the instant coffee Bill provides is not to my taste. I believe coffee must\n be brewed from freshly ground beans. \n\n I pressed him to get me some whole beans, and several weeks later, my wish was\n granted. He presented to me a single bag.\n\n Needless to say, I headed straight for the kitchen and began preparations for\n brewing the perfect cup.\n\n But there's not a single coffee grinder in the whole mansion.\n\n And so I now realize the error of my ways. My folly was not requesting a coffee\n grinder along with the whole beans.\n\n But as I sat sipping my instant coffee, it occurred to me... There is no shortage\n of tea sets. Tea pots and the like decorate countless shelves in this mansion. \n\n Much like Sayoko, the people who lived here must have been fans of black tea.\n My late wife was practically obsessed with it herself. She chose not only her tea\n leaves and cup, but also the temperature of the water based on her mood of\n the day.\n \n I suppose we all have our preferences. And I'm sure that was also the case with\n the individual members of the Edward family.
AC1_Richard_memo_00047	#08 The Canned Goods Life
AC1_Richard_memo_00048	 Living on this island presents many challenges, not the least of which is keeping\n myself fed.\n\n I didn't used to be a picky eater... But oh, how that has changed.\n\n After years of subsisting on nothing but canned food and emergency rations, I\n have grown so tired of the same flavors day after day. It's becoming harder and\n harder to choke the food down.\n\n And then, like deus ex machina, I happened upon some fishing gear left in the\n kitchen. It looked like it had some life left in it yet, so I decided today was the\n day I catch my own food.\n\n But no matter how long I waited by the water...not a single bite. Nature is cruel\n and unforgiving in its lessons.\n\n So in the end, I carried my empty bucket back to the mansion, and plated my\n usual canned meal of fish preserved in oil that smells like aluminum.\n\n I can't wait for the day I can laugh about these fishing mishaps with someone else.\n It's such thoughts that make me long for a table piled high with a home-cooked\n meal, shared with Sayoko and Ashley.\n\n P.S.\n My three favorite canned meals are corned beef, chili beans, and clam chowder.\n The chili beans have a really nice spice to them.
AC1_Richard_memo_00049	#09 Off-Putting Radio
AC1_Richard_memo_00050	 Being alone is more than just being lonely.\n\n It's a chance to notice something new.\n\n If you close your eyes and listen on this abandoned island, it's not silence you'll\n hear. The island is overflowing with the melody of nature.\n\n The crashing of the waves, the rustling of the trees, the howling of the wind, the\n chirping of the birds... The sounds of nature harmonize into an entire symphony.\n Listening to it has become a joy.\n\n Speaking of music... I'm reminded of the radio I found last night in the lounge.\n No matter which channel I change it to, it plays the same song... And when I\n try to adjust its tuning, it emits nothing but static.\n\n Faced with no other recourse, I turned it off before finishing a late dinner in the\n dining room. But the moment I stood to leave, the radio turned itself on and\n resumed playing that same song.\n\n I was so surprised I dropped my plate. I bolted back to my room and leapt into\n my bed, where I spent the rest of the night hiding under the blankets.\n\n I didn't sleep a wink.\n\n As a man of science, I know I should seek a logical explanation for phenomena\n beyond my understanding. And generally speaking, I should seek to be braver...\n But this was so off-putting that I simply can't bring myself to seek either. It's\n times like these I could use some liquid courage.\n\n It looks like I may never get over certain fears, Sayoko.
AC1_Richard_memo_00051	#10 Changing my Mood
AC1_Richard_memo_00052	 Creating something new is no simple task. This is true of anything, including\n ANOTHER.\n\n When research isn't proceeding as I hoped, I'll pick up a book to take my mind\n off things. Fortunately for me, the mansion's study contains countless books from\n impenetrable hardback volumes to light-and-breezy paperback reads.\n\n I'll grab a random book from the dusty old shelves and head into the forest,\n where I'll flip through the pages of an old novel in the sunlight dappled through\n the branches of a tree. It's during these moments I can forget about the research\n that vexes me and recharge my mind.\n\n And it's these moments where I'm at my most peaceful.\n\n Most recently, I've been blazing through a detective novel by an author named\n David Shields. His style of prose and story development are my tastes exactly.\n\n After my reading session, I'll stroll over to the pier to take in the sights of the\n water from the cliff. When I look out at the horizon, I think back to the living\n room of our house in Seattle...\n\n To happier days with Sayoko and Ashley. Days that I can never have back.\n\n Anyway... Perhaps I'll make a stool and place it under the tree on the cliff.\n And in doing so, I can imagine I'm sitting with them at home.
AC1_Richard_memo_00053	#11 A Fan After 60 Years
AC1_Richard_memo_00054	 Thomas, an aspiring novelist, had several books published after leaving the\n island. Most of them were not received very well, but the detective novels he\n wrote under the pen name David Shields seemed to do fairly well. They were\n published in paperback.\n\n But they were far from best-sellers. More than a few of his volumes were canceled\n before they were even completed.\n\n Thomas never gained notoriety as an author. I only learned of him after coming\n here. However, as I read one of his novels, I became captivated by his prose.\n And now I can say I've read nearly all of his works that can be found here in\n the mansion.\n\n Thomas passed away at age 36 after completing a long-form autobiography.\n I can't help but wonder what sort of adventures Detective Kyle Hyde would\n have gotten up to had Thomas lived longer.
AC1_Richard_memo_00055	#12 Leonard Edward, the Musician
AC1_Richard_memo_00056	 Lawrence had one child: a son named Leonard.\n\n Lawrence tried to establish him as a successor, but whether due to a difference in\n values or something else entirely, Leonard refused to take over the family\n business. Instead, he chose to leave home and pursue a career as a musician.\n\n There was no word on Leonard's whereabouts for a long time. Then one day, he\n sent his father a letter, telling him that he married a woman he met in a bar.\n Lawrence resented the fact he had not approved of the marriage so he refused\n to see his son. They lost touch again after this.\n\n Several years passed, and Lawrence received another letter from Leonard. He had\n two sons by then: Henry and Thomas. Although Lawrence finally agreed to see his\n son, it was too late. Leonard became sick during an epidemic and passed away\n at age 30.\n\n A thought occurred to me as I learned of these two and how they couldn't\n connect with one another... In order for a child to understand the motivations\n of a parent who loses themself in their work, it may be necessary for the child\n to grow up, and become a parent themself.\n\n I wonder if my father thought about Jessica and me as he worked, the same way\n Ashley occupies my thoughts as I continue my work on ANOTHER.
AC1_Richard_memo_00057	#13 My Four Philosophies
AC1_Richard_memo_00058	 There were many researchers like Sayoko and Bill at the lab where I used to work.\n Whenever I hit a roadblock in my research, or had trouble clarifying some\n hypothesis, I'd ask a fellow researcher for help or indulge in superfluous\n conversations. This would often knock something in my brain loose to help\n set me back on track.\n\n But that's not too easy in my current research environment. So I wrote down the\n four philosophies I used to talk about with Sayoko, and I've taken to repeating\n them when I need help.\n\n ・ Don't get stuck on a single thought. Continue to develop new hypotheses.\n ・ Try to refute my own hypotheses from different perspectives.\n ・ Never assume something is impossible. A 1% chance of success is still a chance\n of success.\n ・ Never lose that never-give-up attitude.\n\n Whenever I get stuck, I repeat these four philosophies to myself. They represent\n the passion Sayoko and I both had for research.
AC1_Richard_memo_00059	#14 Genetic Memory
AC1_Richard_memo_00060	 I found an extremely interesting article in a scientific magazine today. Thanks to\n an advancement in research in the field of genetic memory, the field Sayoko\n once studied, a "DNA memory expansion device" has been developed. It's\n expected to be announced soon.\n\n Genetic memory is the theory that an organism's experiences and memories are\n stored in its DNA. And when that DNA is transferred into another organism, the\n experiences and memories are inherited. In short, this supports the theory\n that an individual's experiences and memories can be transferred to another\n person.\n\n What would Sayoko think if she could experience this new device? Knowing her,\n she would want to test it by making a backup of her own memories, so that Ashley\n could have a piece of her after she was gone. If only she could have done such\n a thing...\n\n But Sayoko is gone. So the thought must go as well.
ACR_Characters_00472	Ashley
ACR_Characters_00291	Ashley Mizuki Robins
ACR_Characters_00292	  It's been just over two years since that trip to\nBlood Edward Island. My dad and I lived together\nfor a while afterward, but it never felt quite right.\nEventually, around the time I started high school,\nDad left home again, using his work as an\nexcuse. After that, I really threw myself into my\nmusic, which I love, and got an electric-acoustic\nguitar so I could become a musician.\n  Just when I was getting serious about practicing,\nI got an invitation out of the blue to go camping\nwith Dad. Like I didn't have my own plans.\n  But I couldn't exactly say no, so I came to the\ncampground, and surprise, surprise, Dad doesn't\nshow up. And then my bag was stolen! This\nwhole thing sucks and I shouldn't have come.
ACR_Characters_00293	  I got to the campground and finally met up\nwith Dad. I wanted to just turn around and go\nhome right away, but then he started talking.\nHe told me about the reason he invited me here\nand why he was working at J.C. Valley, and I\ndecided to stick around, at least for a little while.\n  Dad gave me Mom's bracelet, the RAS. It had\nbeen set up to recognize my biometrics. We\ncouldn't figure out why she would leave this for\nme, but at least we talked about Mom for the\nfirst time in a long while. So naturally that was\nDad's cue to disappear again. Because of work,\nagain. He even vanished right when I was going\nto ask him about what happened with the RAS\nat the guesthouse!\n  And if all that wasn't enough, I was surrounded\nby a bunch of people I didn't know and didn't\nhave anything to say to.\n  Around that time, Ryan came to talk to me.\nI get kind of a strange vibe from him—have we\nmet before?
ACR_Characters_00294	  On my way to Dad's cottage to drop off the hat\nhe forgot, I found Matthew. My first thought was\nto catch him and make him give me back my bag,\nbut he ran away from me and got stuck in a well\nbehind an abandoned building. Who hides in\na well?!\n  I learned a lot talking to Matthew, like why he\nstole my bag and why he ran away from home.\nHe's not just a random criminal jerk like I thought.\nI decided to help him look for his dad when I\nrealized he was basically me two years ago.\n  We searched the boat house on the shore that\nhad been all sealed up and we found his dad\nMichael's briefcase. While we were looking\nthrough it, Dan almost caught us, but I distracted\nhim and Matthew sneaked away. That reminds\nme though—Dan mentioned something\nhappened with the clock tower five years ago...\n  As we explored the lakeshore, I remembered\nsome more stuff about Mom. I was pretty little\nin the memory, but I was worried about her, like\nshe seemed different or something.
ACR_Characters_00295	  Matthew had run off to the basement of an old,\nempty house that he says a photographer used to\nlive in. There was a picture on the wall of\nMatthew's family, from when they were all happy\nand living together. He looked so sad talking\nabout that picture and all the fun he had with\nhis family. I'm sure he wants to see them all again\nas soon as possible, but we can't keep this up\nforever. If we spend all day searching and don't\nfind any clues about his dad, he's going to go\nhome for now.\n  In Dad's cottage, we looked at the floppy disk\nwe found in Michael's briefcase. There was a\nreport that said the pollution in the lake was\n"an unknown contaminant," meaning it can't be\nCrusoe Resort's fault, so Matthew's dad is\ninnocent! Elizabeth said that Michael's company\npolluted the water, but I guess sometimes people\njust decide things without evidence.
ACR_Characters_00296	  We found out about a new feature on the DAS:\nwater analysis. We used it to check the water in\nthe lake, and it found the "unknown contaminant"\nthat's causing the pollution. If we can figure out\nwhat it is, we should be able to prove that\nMatthew's dad is innocent!\n  There's been a suspicious-looking guy sniffing\naround, which kinda makes me think that J.C.\nValley is connected to the pollution somehow.\nWe'll just have to keep digging.\n  On the way back to Dad's cottage, I ran into\nRyan again. When I told him we were looking for\nMatthew's dad, he knew all about the pollution\nand Crusoe Resort too. He even knew that\nthe allegations against Crusoe are wrong, and\nseems like he knows who's really responsible,\nbut he wouldn't tell me, which was frustrating.\nWhile I was talking to him, my head got all\nfuzzy. I wonder what that was about.\n  On my way to leave Ryan's cottage, I noticed\na kaleidoscope on the windowsill. He said it was\na memento of his mother, and you used to be\nable to see cherry blossoms when you look in it,\nbut it's broken now. When I saw it, I remembered\nMom, holding that same kaleidoscope and\nstanding in front of a grave. Whose grave\nwas that?
ACR_Characters_00297	  Matthew disappeared from the cottage, and\nI found him drinking tea at Charlotte Graham's\nhouse. I guess he found a picture in the briefcase\nthat made him think there was a connection\nbetween Charlotte and John, so he went to see\nher. He didn't find a connection though.\n  Rude of him to leave me behind, but I guess I\nleft him alone for quite a while. I'm glad I was\nable to find him, anyway. Who knows whose bags\nhe might steal if he was alone again?\n  While I was looking for Matthew, I ran into Bob,\nand heard a lot about Charlotte and something\nabout the clock tower, but he wouldn't tell me\nwhat happened five years ago, either. What are\nhe and Dan hiding?\n  We needed three keys to investigate the clock\ntower: we found the Sword Key in the shed at\nCharlotte's house, and the Flower Key in the\nletter from Olivia. We borrowed the Moon Key\nfrom Charlotte herself, so we should be able to\nget in there now.\n  If Matthew gets nervous, I'll share those magic\nwords: Even though facing the truth can be hard,\nin the end, it's always for the best.
ACR_Characters_00298	  We got into the clock tower, and used the\nthree keys to get the clock moving again. I left\nMatthew to go listen to the bell on the top\nfloor, but he disappeared while I was up there.\nHe had remembered something when he heard\nthe bell.\n  I chased after him and we ended up at the\nruins of Crusoe Resort, where something weird\nhappened. Matthew read a letter from his mom\nand suddenly remembered everything. Just when\nit seemed like he was going to break down from\nremembering Kelly's death, she appeared in\nfront of him. She fell from the tower five years\nago, but I guess she never left his side. I'm glad\nyou got to learn the truth, and also say a proper\ngoodbye, Matthew. I think you'll be all right now.\n  My turn: I'm pretty sure the reason Mom came\nto Lake Juliet was to visit J.C. Valley. What I don't\nknow is why. Michael's report said that J.C. Valley\nis the one responsible for the pollution. There's\nsomething going on here, and I don't think even\nDad knows what it is.
ACR_Characters_00299	  As soon as I walked into J.C. Valley, Sofia\ngrabbed me and locked me in a lab. It all\nhappened so fast that I just panicked. Sofia\nattacked Ian, Gina, and my dad just to get the\nANOTHER data. How could someone do that just\nfor money?\n  I was freaking out because I had no idea where\nI was, but Gina and Ian rescued me and I finally\ngot to see Dad again.\n  Sofia chased after us to steal the ANOTHER\ndata, and we ran to a room where I saw\nANOTHER itself. Ryan was right next to it, and as\nsoon as he saw me, I started to feel faint and\ncollapsed. Ryan's plan was to use ANOTHER to\nrevive Mom by transferring her liquid memories\nfrom my pendant into my body. But the RAS she\nleft for me helped me stop that from happening.\nWhen he realized that Mom's memories were\ngone, Ryan looked sad and vanished. Was he a\nghost? Or something else?
ACR_Characters_00300	  After I left the ANOTHER room, Rex told me\nJudd's secret and the truth about Mom, along\nwith all the sad stuff that Ryan went through.\nThe Ryan I met was just an illusion, but I talked\nto him like a real person. It's hard to believe.\n  To help me remember what Mom said 13 years\nago, I went with Dad to a little island on the\nlake, where the real Ryan is buried. I met Ryan\nagain there, and found out the whole truth\nabout him and why he wanted to bring Mom\nback. A storm six years ago damaged the lab\nand made a bunch of Ryan's liquid memory leak\nout, which polluted the lake and made his\nconsciousness a kind of memory ghost. But the\nclean water coming out of the spring on the\nisland is slowly clearing out the pollution, and\nRyan is fading. He'll disappear completely pretty\nsoon, but I'll never forget him. Mom found him,\nand I'll keep his memory alive.\n  It's been an incredible (and long) day. I learned\nstuff I didn't know about my parents, met new\nfriends, and made memories I'll treasure forever.
ACR_Characters_00473	Richard
ACR_Characters_00301	Richard Robins
ACR_Characters_00302	  A little over two years ago, I reunited with my\ndad on Blood Edward Island after 11 years\napart. We started living together again after that,\nbut 11 years really is a long time, and our\nrelationship got awkward fast. Dad left home to\nstart working at a place called J.C. Valley. I think\nI may have driven him away.\n  What are we doing here, Dad? You didn't even\nbother coming home on weekends for the last\nsix months, and suddenly we're going camping?\nWhat's going on with you?
ACR_Characters_00303	  Dad hasn't changed at all in the past six months.\nHe's so wrapped up in his own life he hasn't even\nthought about mine. I thought he forgot to meet\nme at the bus stop because he didn't actually\ncare, but he says that's wrong. He invited me\nhere to show me the lake one more time, and\nto figure out why Mom came here. He should\nhave just explained right away!\n  But I can't really blame him for wanting to know\nmore about what happened to Mom... I want to\nknow too.
ACR_Characters_00304	  I told Dad that Matthew is the runaway that Dan\nis looking for, and Dad surprised me by telling me\nnot to report him. It's good to know that Dad's\nnot the same as all the other adults.\n  There are a bunch of pictures of me and Mom\nby Dad's desk on the second floor of the cottage.\nOne of them was him and Mom in front of the\nmermaid statue by the lake. He looks so much\nyounger in the photo—I wonder if it was taken\nright before they got married.
ACR_Characters_00305	  We found a new feature on the DAS that lets\nme do a water-quality test just by taking a photo.\nI think we can use it to prove that Matthew's dad\nis innocent. \n  Did Dad create this feature too? Why? Is it\nrelated to why Mom came here? It does show\nthat Dad's a pretty amazing scientist though.\nHard to imagine, since he seems so unreliable\nwith me...\n  Oh, and when we stopped by Bob's restaurant,\nthere was a picture of Dad there, holding a fish\nhe caught and smiling really big. It was nice to\nsee him looking happy instead of just fretting\nabout research all the time.
ACR_Characters_00306	  Dad didn't come home after going to the lab\nto help with the system problem, so I guess he's\nstill here. I don't know what kind of research he's\ndoing, but he must have a lot of responsibilities.\nOh, and Ryan said that there's something Dad\nwants to talk to me about. What could that be?\nBut I've got stuff to ask him about as well, so\nthat works out.\n  I kind of want to go find Dad, but I'm worried\nthat Sofia might be here and try to lock me\nup again.
ACR_Characters_00307	  I'm really glad Dad was there for me when I\nwoke up from the ANOTHER. I was feeling pretty\nvulnerable after everything that happened, but\nseeing his face made me feel safe again.\n  He was surprised to learn that the only reason\nI made it out was thanks to Mom. After I told him,\nhe just stared at her pendant... I wonder what he\nwas thinking about.\n  Dad started working at J.C. Valley because he\nfound out that the ANOTHER data he thought\nwas destroyed two years ago on Blood Edward\nIsland was actually sent to J.C. Valley. He wanted\nto figure out why. He has a bad habit of keeping\nthings to himself and not telling me what's going\non. I guess he doesn't want me to worry, but it\nleaves me feeling alone. We're family—it would\nbe nice if he would act like it.
ACR_Characters_00308	  Mom's pendant contained the memories Judd\nstole from her, which Rex secretly converted to\nliquid memory. I was sad to learn what happened\nto Mom at J.C. Valley all those years ago, but\nDad was absolutely shocked by it. Maybe Mom\nkept it secret all this time to protect us.\n  It's a relief that the ANOTHER data didn't end\nup with the bad guys, and that Sofia has been\ncaught. Dad is going to stay at the lab to help\nRex, so I guess he won't be coming home any\ntime soon. But I've already proven to myself that\nI can be OK without Dad, and I can support him\ndoing what he wants to do. I think it's what Mom\nwould have wanted too. Besides, I can just come\nhere and visit him when I want, and get a yummy\nSalmon Rice Burger from Bob while I'm here!
ACR_Characters_00474	Sayoko
ACR_Characters_00309	Sayoko Robins
ACR_Characters_00310	  My mom died on the night my third birthday,\n13 years ago. When I saw her death through\nANOTHER on Blood Edward Island, she had a\npeaceful look on her face as Dad held her in \nhis arms. She was worried that ANOTHER would\nbe used for harm, so Dad destroyed it.\n  Dad's gift for my 14th birthday was a pendant\nfrom Mom. As long as I wear it, she's with me.
ACR_Characters_00311	  I came to Lake Juliet because Dad invited me,\nbut as soon as the gate opened, I remembered\nsomething about Mom. I saw Mom holding my\nhand as we walked through the gate. I've been\nhere before, with Mom. Why would she bring\nme here?\n  Mom left a bracelet called the RAS in the lab,\nand it's biometrically keyed to me, so I guess it's\nmine now. Why did she leave this for me? What's\ngoing on?
ACR_Characters_00312	  On the shore of Lake Juliet, I had another\nmemory about Mom from 13 years ago. I saw her\nstaring silently out at the lake, holding my hand.\nWhat was she thinking about? I don't remember\nthe details, but I felt like she was different\nsomehow right then. Did something happen to\nher that day?
ACR_Characters_00313	  In front of the clock tower, I had another\nflashback about Mom from 13 years ago. She\ntold me when I was little that she and Dad had\nbeen to the top of this clock tower. She looked\nreally happy telling me how beautiful the view\nis from the top.\n  The clock tower is locked up now, but it used to\nbe open for the public to go all the way to the\ntop. I want to climb up there myself someday. I\nbet it's a beautiful view!\n  Did Mom come here to revisit those memories\nshe made with Dad?
ACR_Characters_00314	  When I saw the picture of the food stand in\nBob's restaurant, I remembered something else\nfrom 13 years ago. I saw Bob at the food stand\nhanding Mom a paper bag—Mom was a customer\nof his, and even inspired him to come up with\nthe Salmon Rice Burger! I was surprised that\nthe folks around here remember Mom as well,\nbut it's always nice to hear more stories about her.\n  Bob said Mom was waiting for someone by the\nclock tower. Who could it have been?
ACR_Characters_00315	  When I met Elizabeth's dad, Rex, at their house,\nI suddenly remembered Mom talking to Rex.\nDid I actually meet Rex 13 years ago when we\nfirst came here? Rex denied it, but it seems like\nhe did know Mom, so maybe he was the one\nshe was waiting for at the clock tower?\n  In my memory, Mom looked worried, and Rex\nlooked sad to see her like that. There was a lot\nof tension in the air—what were they talking\nabout?
ACR_Characters_00316	  When I approached the entrance to J.C. Valley,\nI flashed back to Mom pulling my hand as we\nwent into the lab. And the room that Sofia locked\nme in also looked familiar—I'd been there before.\nAnd at that time, Mom was talking to...someone.\nA man wearing a lab coat. I thought Mom retired\nfrom science when I was born—why would she\ncome all this way to visit? Could it have been to\nsee this guy? Whatever it was, she kept it secret\nfrom Dad...
ACR_Characters_00317	  While ANOTHER was showing me memories, I\nmet my mom, who died 13 years ago. I always\nwanted to talk to her, so seeing her just standing\nin front of me was like a dream or something. She\nsurvived that night, if only as data stored in\nliquid memory. When she saw me, she smiled and\nsaid "You've grown so much," as she hugged me.\nI'm glad I got to spend a little bit of time with\nher, even if it was just her memories.\n  I would have had my memories overwritten if\nit wasn't for Mom's RAS. Somehow she knew\nsomething like this might happen, and was able\nto protect me from beyond the grave.
ACR_Characters_00318	  The reason Mom visited the island 13 years ago\nwas to return Ryan's kaleidoscope and say her\nfinal goodbye to him. She must have known then\nthat her memories would be erased. That's why\nshe took me all around the lake, soaking up the\nnostalgia.\n  Mom saved me twice. Once 13 years ago, when\nshe was killed, and once inside my own\nmemories. I owe her my life a few times over!\n  When our memories were all swirled together,\nwe saw a bunch of her memories of me and Dad.\nShe seemed happy to see them one last time. \nHer memories are gone now, but I've made new\nones of her that aren't going anywhere. She'll\nbe with me in my heart forever.
ACR_Characters_00475	Jessica
ACR_Characters_00319	Jessica Robins
ACR_Characters_00320	  Jessica is my aunt, and basically my favorite\nperson. She's raised me since I was little, just like\na mother. When Dad came back to live with us,\nand his and my relationship got awkward, she\nwas always worrying about us. I agreed to come\non this trip partly because I didn't want to worry\nher any more. She said the reason Dad invited\nme was that there was something he wanted to\ntalk to me about, just us, but what's there to say\nat this point? I certainly don't have anything to\nsay to him.
ACR_Characters_00321	  I took a phone call from Jessica while I was in\nDad's cottage. She asked if I was enjoying the\ntrip, but I hadn't even really thought about it,\nwhat with finding out about Michael, and\nflashbacks to Mom, so I wound up lying to her\nabout it. I'll tell her the truth later on.\n  She didn't have anything urgent to say to Dad,\nbut I'll be sure to tell him she called next time\nI see him.
ACR_Characters_00322	  Jessica thought I sounded different when she\ncalled yesterday, and was worried enough about\nit to come out to the cottage and check on me.\n...Which reminds me that I forgot to tell Dad\nshe called. Oops.\n  She seemed really happy to see me and Dad\ngetting along so well—she's been worried about\nus for a while. But the last 24 hours have helped\nme see Dad in a much better light, and I plan\nto be the daughter he deserves. So you can\nrelax about us, Jessica.
ACR_Characters_00476	Matthew
ACR_Characters_00323	Matthew Crusoe
ACR_Characters_00324	  The boy who stole my bag. All I know about him\nis that he's real fast. I need to find him and get\nthat bag back—there's a bunch of important\nstuff in there. I hope he hasn't looked inside yet.\n  But who is he? And what did he steal my\nbag for?
ACR_Characters_00325	  I found the boy who stole my bag in the storage\nroom of the guesthouse. He was rummaging for\nfood with a big dog. I almost caught him, but he's\nso fast I lost him again. \n  After he ran away, I found a watch on the\nground nearby. It was engraved "To Matthew."\nDid the kid drop it?
ACR_Characters_00326	  So that boy's name is Matthew, after all. He ran\naway to the lake, and I caught him after he fell\ninto a well by an abandoned building. Well, I\nguess "rescued" is closer to the truth.\n  When Matthew told me that he was looking\nfor his dad who had gone missing, I was\nsympathetic right away. I totally get wanting\nto find your father. But I didn't trust him at first,\nand I said mean things to him. I can't make that\nup to him, exactly, but I can help him look for\nclues about his dad.\n  I mean, look at this poor kid: all alone, with\nhis mom dead and his dad missing. I can't just\ndo nothing.
ACR_Characters_00327	  When Matthew saw the photo of his family in\nthe basement of that old house, it seemed so\npainful for him, remembering the days when they\nwere all together and happy. He doesn't really\nremember what happened when his dad went\nmissing though. He reminds me of D—I wonder\nif something terrible happened to him too. He\nreally, really didn't want to go to the clock tower,\nwhich makes me wonder if he's connected to\nwhatever stopped the clock there.\n  Hang in there, Matthew—we figured out that\nthe pollution wasn't your dad's fault, and I'm sure\nwe'll find more clues!
ACR_Characters_00328	  Matthew is desperate to find out more about\nthis "unknown contaminant" that's causing the\nlake pollution, but apparently not as desperate\nas he was for a meal. He practically inhaled two\nof the Salmon Rice Burgers at Bob's restaurant.\nThey are really good though—I understand why\nit's the most popular thing on the menu.\n  I told Matthew I'd help him look for clues about\nhis dad, but I got sidetracked talking with Ryan,\nthen going to Elizabeth's house. Sorry, Matthew!\nI've also got a parental mystery going on with my\nmom, so it's easy to get distracted. But I'll get\nserious about helping now. After all, I'm the one\nwho said we'd find something by the end of\nthe day!
ACR_Characters_00329	  There was a photo stuck in Michael's notebook.\nMatthew saw it and assumed this John guy is\nbehind everything, and ran off to go find him.\nHe's so reckless! But then I found him sipping tea\nat Charlotte's, and I was so exasperated that I\ncouldn't even get mad at him right.\n  Matthew was thrilled to hear that Charlotte\nknew his dad. She started telling old stories,\nand he blurted out that he wants to investigate\nthe clock tower. He thinks if he can remember\nwhat happened there, he'll be able to find his\ndad. I was nervous, because we'd been told to\navoid talking about the clock tower, but it all\nworked out, and now we're free to check it out,\nbut he's really got to work on controlling himself.
ACR_Characters_00330	  One by one, Matthew remembered all sorts of\nthings in the clock tower. About how he always\nused to play with Kelly, in the lake or in the tower.\nAbout how they would meet their dad at Crusoe\nResort. And when he heard the bell, he\nremembered where Crusoe Resort was. We found\nEmily's letter there, and Matthew remembered\neverything that happened five years ago. It was\nsad and painful, but now Matthew should be\nable to move on. He even got to say a goodbye\nto Kelly, and we found out where his father is.\nI hope he gets to live happily ever after with\nhis dad.\n  I'm glad I picked up his watch and returned it\nto him. Just be careful not to lose it again,\nMatthew.
ACR_Characters_00331	  I wonder how Matthew's doing now. I'm sure\nhe and Michael are still catching up, but I should\nwrite him a letter when things get back to\nnormal.\n  What happened five years ago was\nheartbreaking, but I know Matthew will be fine.\nYou're not alone, Matthew. Just like I have Dad\nand Jessica, you've got Michael and Greg.\nTogether, you can deal with anything. Plus,\nyou'll always have me rooting for you!
ACR_Characters_00477	Michael
ACR_Characters_00332	Michael Crusoe
ACR_Characters_00333	  Matthew's dad, who disappeared without a\ntrace five years ago. He was super rich, and got\ngrabbed by kidnappers. Matthew's uncle won't\npay the ransom, so his dad still hasn't come home.\nAt least...that's how Matthew tells it. It sounds a\nlittle too much like a movie to me...
ACR_Characters_00334	  Matthew's dad really has been missing for five\nyears, but he wasn't actually kidnapped. Matthew\nhas no idea what happened to him or where he\nis now, but he's so desperate to find out that he\nran away from home. I hope he finds his dad\nsoon.
ACR_Characters_00335	  Matthew's dad was the president of a resort\ncompany, so I guess the "super rich" part was\nactually true.\n  The company was called Crusoe Resort, and\nthey were trying to make Lake Juliet into a\ntourist trap, with stuff like the campground and\nboat house. But there was some kind of trouble,\nand the company went bankrupt five years ago.\nMaybe that's why Michael went missing?\n  Huh... The clock tower was also sealed up five\nyears ago and Michael disappeared five years\nago. What else happened here five years ago?
ACR_Characters_00336	  We found a photo of Matthew's family in the\nbasement of an old house. The dad in the\npicture is a tall, responsible-looking guy. He\ndoesn't look like a guy who would be polluting\nthe lake—he's got too kind a face.\n  Michael was investigating the lake pollution and\nfound out that it was caused by an "unknown\ncontaminant." Seems like he went missing while\ntrying to figure out what that contaminant was.
ACR_Characters_00337	  Michael was sort-of friends with Charlotte. She\ntalked about how he was kind of a troublemaker\nof a kid that she yelled at sometimes, but he also\ncame to visit her occasionally as an adult. It\nseems like he wanted to make sure she was OK\nafter her husband died. Maybe Matthew gets his\nkindness from his dad. It sounds like he was a\ngreat father—his son sure loves him.
ACR_Characters_00338	  There was a poster in the ruined old office of\nCrusoe Resort. It showed what Lake Juliet would\nhave looked like if the resort was completed. It\nwas absolutely beautiful—I could see why\nMichael was working toward it. But everyone\nblamed him for the pollution, and that must have\nhurt a lot. But you don't need to worry anymore,\nMichael. With your documents and the info from\nIan, Greg will show everyone what that pollution\nreally was. You just get better and take care of\nMatthew, and maybe go visit Charlotte again\nwhen you're ready.
ACR_Characters_00478	Kelly
ACR_Characters_00339	Kelly Crusoe
ACR_Characters_00340	  Matthew's little sister. She loves stuffed animals.\nThat strange little rabbit in her father's briefcase\nwas kinda cute. I guess I can see why she liked it.\nThat one must be her favorite, in fact. It was\nfalling apart, so you can tell just how much she\nloves it.
ACR_Characters_00341	  There was a photo of Matthew's family in the\nbasement of the old house, and in it, a cute\nlittle girl with the same blue eyes as Matthew.\nShe was holding that stuffed rabbit. That's Kelly.\n  If she loves that rabbit so much, how did it end\nup in her dad's briefcase? It seems like she'd\nnever let it go. I thought Matthew would take it,\nbut he didn't. I don't get why not. Maybe he just\ndoesn't like that rabbit.\n  Kelly is somewhere far away, and Matthew\nhasn't been able to see her in a while. She must\nfeel as lonely as he does, not being able to hug\nher big brother.
ACR_Characters_00342	   We learned the sad truth about what happened\nto Kelly. She fell from the clock tower and died—\nright in front of Matthew. He's sick with guilt.\n  Kelly's ghost appeared to us. He told her that\nhe had failed her as a brother, but she forgave\nhim. Maybe she was relieved to see that he\nstarted to recover, I don't know. But she had a big\nsmile on her face. Their mother showed up too,\nand she and Kelly left together. It's good that\nMatthew remembered what happened. I hope\nthat Emily and Kelly are watching over him.
ACR_Characters_00479	Emily
ACR_Characters_00343	Emily Crusoe
ACR_Characters_00344	  Matthew's mom died from an illness. It seems\nlike, before she died, she was mad that Matthew\ncared so much about his missing dad, but why?\nAlways crying, and so angry... I wonder if she had\na reason to want Matthew to give up on his dad.\nI guess she wanted to protect him. Since Matthew\nwas so brokenhearted about his dad, I can only\nimagine how sad she felt when she got ill and was\nforced to leave her son's side.
ACR_Characters_00345	  There was a photo of Matthew's family in the\nbasement of the old house, and in it was\nMatthew's mother smiling brightly. She looks like\nshe was a very kind person. It seems she was\nprone to illness and pretty weak, but whenever\nMatthew and Kelly played together, she took joy\nin seeing them. I'm sure being with the family she\nloved so much is what made her look so happy.
ACR_Characters_00346	  Matthew found a letter his mom wrote his dad\nin a locker in the deserted Crusoe Resort. It was\nthe key to unlocking all of Matthew's memories.\nShe wrote about what happened to Kelly, and\nthat she didn't have long left. She was \noverwhelmed by worry for Matthew, who had\nbeen through such trauma, and Michael, who\nwas completely focused on his work. Emily cared\nso much about her family...\n  You don't need to worry about Matthew\nanymore, Emily. He'll be able to come to terms\nwith what happened to Kelly, and he'll be\nreunited with his dad soon. I just know that they'll\nalways take care of each other, just as you wrote\nback then. Please, watch over them.
ACR_Characters_00480	Elizabeth
ACR_Characters_00347	Elizabeth Alfred
ACR_Characters_00348	  A member of Tommy's band, and the daughter\nof Rex, the director of J.C. Valley.\n  I first saw her at the campground, but she was\nbusy so I didn't have a chance to say hi. Later\nI did, and I regretted it.\n  Turns out, she's the WORST! The first time we\nspoke, she ignored what I had to say and talked\ndown to me the whole time! I just wanted to say\nhi! Was that so wrong? \n  We're complete strangers! Where does she get\noff? I'm not here because I want to be, and if I\nknew what she was like, I wouldn't have even\nbothered to speak to her. In fact, I shouldn't have.\n  Not my cup of tea. Clearly.
ACR_Characters_00349	  The keyboardist and vocalist for Tommy's band.\nShe's also the daughter of Rex, the director of\nJ.C. Valley.\n    I first saw her at the campground, but she was\nbusy so I didn't have a chance to say hi. Later\nI did, and I regretted it.\n  Turns out, she's the WORST! The first time we\nspoke, she ignored what I had to say and talked\ndown to me the whole time! I just wanted to say\nhi! My mistake, I guess. I just don't get her. Her\ndad is my dad's boss, so I have to be careful\nwhat I say to her. How frustrating! If it weren't for\nthat, I would have let her have it! How I wish I\ncould...\n  I can't believe she's friends with Tommy and\nJanet. They make a big deal about her taste in\nmusic and fashion sense, but I can't just look\npast her personality and appreciate that stuff.\nWhy did I even come here, again?
ACR_Characters_00350	  The keyboardist and vocalist in Tommy's band.\nI saw her sitting alone on a bench by the lake so\nI figured I'd ask what she was up to... But she\nblasted me, saying, "It's none of your business."\nReally, what is wrong with her? Why is she always\nsnapping at me? Was it so wrong to ask what she\nwas up to?\n  Then when she saw that Matthew was with me,\nshe got this look and said that he's the son of\nCrusoe Resort's president, who did terrible\nthings to the lake. Seriously. What is up with this\ngirl? Matthew had nothing to do with that! It's\njust awful to believe stories without any proof\nlike that, on top of saying such hurtful things.\n  I can't possibly see myself ever getting along\nwith Elizabeth.
ACR_Characters_00351	  The keyboardist and vocalist for Tommy's band.\nShe's also the daughter of Rex, the director of\nJ.C. Valley. She's selfish, conceited, and has a\nterrible attitude. In other words, it's safe to say I\ndon't have the best impression of her. All the\nsame... Tommy and Janet see her not just as a\nbandmate, but as a friend. They were really\nworried when she stopped showing up to\npractice. When I ran into her by the lake, we\ntalked about the band, and it was obvious\nsomething's bothering her. There must be a\nreason she's skipping practice... Wait, why\nshould I care? I guess because I think she \nought to tell Tommy and Janet. Especially Janet—\nshe wants to make it as a band, and it's obvious\nshe thinks Elizabeth has the talent.\n  Look, it's true that I can't stand her. And I've\nbeen trying to avoid her. But if she's as good as\nthey say, I need to hear her sing. At least once.\nJust to see what I'm up against! That makes sense,\nright? With that recording of their song lost, it's\nnot like there's any other way to hear her. The\nleast she could do is show up to practice! Right?\nWhat is going on in her head?
ACR_Characters_00352	  The keyboardist and vocalist for Tommy's band.\nShe's also the daughter of Rex, the director of\nJ.C. Valley.\n  I ran into Janet and Tommy, and somehow we\nall ended up at Elizabeth's house. They asked her\nwhy she's been skipping practice, but surprise,\nsurprise, she didn't really answer the question.\n  Janet told me that Elizabeth likes Tommy. I had\nno clue. We let him deal with the whole situation.\n  While we waited, Janet told me about\nElizabeth's mom. She walked out on the family\nwhen Elizabeth was little. I thought she was\njust spoiled, but maybe there's more to it than\nthat. I mean, I know what it's like to miss your\nmom, and I've definitely taken it out on people\naround me. My feelings about her changed\nso abruptly. Up till then, I'd hated her, and\nsuddenly...\n  I found the missing music player with the\nband's recording on it hidden in her room.\nDefinitely hidden, not lost—it was tucked away\nin a music box her mother gave her. Why? She\nloves singing, but she's struggling with her\nfeelings. That much has become obvious.
ACR_Characters_00353	  The keyboardist and vocalist for Tommy's band.\nShe's also the daughter of Rex, the director of\nJ.C. Valley.\n  When I chased Matthew to the clock tower, I\nran into Elizabeth by the lakeshore. We talked a\nlittle. She dished about her dad's new fiancée,\nand told me why she hid the music player. She\ntotally knew I swiped it. Sorry that I touched your\nstuff! You told me not to and yet, here we are.\n  As best as I can understand, Elizabeth keeps\ncomparing herself to her mom, and she looks\nup to her mom way too much to feel like she\ncan sing half as well. But her voice is her own.\nWhen I heard her sing, I was blown away by its\nbeauty and power. She just needs to find some\nconfidence and keep on singing. Of course, I \ndon't think she wants to hear that from me. If I\ntold her that directly, I can only imagine what\nwould happen.\n  I'm glad we were finally able to really talk. I\nhad almost given up hope! I feel like we\nunderstand each other a bit now. We might\neven get along.
ACR_Characters_00354	  The keyboardist and vocalist for Tommy's band.\nShe's also the daughter of Rex, the director of\nJ.C. Valley.\n  Elizabeth stopped me and we talked about what\nshe's been going through. She may be spoiled,\nand her mood is a rollercoaster, but that's just \ndistraction from what she's really like. Elizabeth is\nhaving a hard time, and she can't talk about it,\nso she resorts to starting arguments.\n  But because I've begun to understand her\nproblems, I can see that we're not so different in\nthat regard. I struggle too. Sharing your feelings \nisn't easy. Telling someone you think you suck\ntakes courage. Lots of courage. I'm not sure why\nshe decided to open up to me, since she seems\nto think I'm really annoying, but I'm genuinely \nhappy that she did. I finally saw her smile when\nwe were joking around. It was a beautiful sight.\n  Now all that's left is for her to open up to\nJanet and Tommy so they can all make up. Truth\nis, they all want the same thing, so what's the \nbig deal? Elizabeth, you've got this!
ACR_Characters_00355	  The keyboardist and vocalist for Tommy's band.\nShe's also the daughter of Rex, the director of\nJ.C. Valley.\n  We've had quite a day, haven't we? When I first\nmet Elizabeth, she came charging in with a bad\nattitude. Now that I know the whole story, I get\nit. Who's this strange girl talking to the guy she\nlikes? There's nothing between Tommy and me,\nof course, but she just saw red.\n  It doesn't help that she's had so much to deal\nwith—her family, the band. But once we opened\nup to each other, I started to see why people\nlike her so much. I think she figured some things\nout too, and it looks like the band might just\nmake it.\n  If they are able to get to the Big-Deal Band\nContest, then I'll be able to see Elizabeth sing\nlive. I still haven't had the chance, so I'm really\nlooking forward to it. I need a rival musician to\nkeep me sharp!
ACR_Characters_00481	Rex
ACR_Characters_00356	Rex Alfred
ACR_Characters_00357	  The director of J.C. Valley. That's where Dad\nworks.\n  Dad invited me to this place full of adults who\nhave no clue I exist. Not exactly fun. Dad pointed\nthis guy out so I thought I'd introduce myself, but\nhe was talking to Sofia, so I hung back...\n  He just feels a bit imposing to talk to, I guess.\nAnd like my dad, it's just work, work, work... I\nguess there's a chance he's friendly. I guess...
ACR_Characters_00358	  The director of J.C. Valley. That's where Dad\nworks. He's Elizabeth's father.\n  Turns out he's Dad's boss, and that means I had\nbetter behave in front of him. He's a little\nintimidating too. Who wears a suit to a cookout?\nAnd all he talks about is work... So I figured he\nwould NOT want to talk to a teenager.\n  And, in fact, he spent the whole cookout\ntalking to Sofia. I don't exactly know why, but I\ngot the feeling there's something going on\nbetween them. Interesting...
ACR_Characters_00359	  The director of J.C. Valley. That's where Dad\nworks. He's Elizabeth's father.\n  There were photos of Dad and his friends on\nthe wall at Bob's diner, and Bob told me all these\nstories about them too. Turns out Dad and Rex\nare friends, and they hang out at Bob's diner. I\nthink of Dad as single-minded, focusing only\non his research. Turns out he has a social life.\n  That's not the only surprise. Bob told me Dad\nlikes music and fishing! The music talk is what\ncaught my attention. Turns out Rex plays guitar?\nSame as me! Guess we do have something to\ntalk about...
ACR_Characters_00360	  The director of J.C. Valley and Elizabeth's father.\n  Tommy and Elizabeth brought me along to\nElizabeth's house when they went to talk to her,\nbut that conversation was a total disaster. She\nended up kicking us out, but Rex came to see\nwhat was going on. Sorry, Rex. We created kind\nof a scene in your home. But it seems like Janet\nis right—he doesn't know what to do about\nElizabeth any more than we do.\n  Seeing Rex does trigger something though.\nI can remember seeing Mom speaking to him...\nAbout what, I don't know. It must be from when\nI was little, but I asked him if we've met before\nand he said no. But why do I remember seeing\nhim, then? I'm pretty sure it was him...\n  We kept talking for a little while, but he didn't\nsay anything else about Mom.
ACR_Characters_00361	  The director of J.C. Valley and Elizabeth's father.\n  Elizabeth and I had a long talk by the lakeshore.\nIt's not just that she's spoiled. She can't stand the\nfact that her father wants to marry Sofia. It must\nbe tough for her—she's clearly hurting from her\nmom just walking out on the family, and here\ncomes somebody else into the picture.\n  The real problem, though, is that Elizabeth\nthinks Sofia doesn't even love her father. So...\nshould they even get married? I don't get what's\ngoing on here, but if that's true, then of course\nElizabeth doesn't want them to get married. Sure,\nshe's giving her father a hard time. But she's\nworried about him! It makes sense. Open your\neyes, Rex!\n  His solution to her general bad behavior is to\njust buy her things. That's not what she needs\nfrom you, Rex. Listen to her. I hope you figure\nthat out soon.
ACR_Characters_00362	  The director of J.C. Valley and Elizabeth's father.\n  When everything was all over, Rex showed me\nand Dad a photo—a photo of Judd, the former\ndirector, and his son, Ryan.\n  Ryan lost his mother when he was just a boy.\nHe completely withdrew... And his father made\nhim the first test subject for the ANOTHER\ntrials. Mom and Rex helped run them, but it was\nJudd who made them do it. And during those\nexperiments, Ryan died.\n  Judd wanted Mom to continue her ANOTHER\nresearch, but she refused. He made her delete\nher own memories of ANOTHER. But along with\nthose, she lost her memories of me too. Rex gave\nher a pendant with her liquid memories inside\nbecause he felt sorry for her.\n  Rex learned about everything Judd had been up\nto only after he took over. The pollution in the\nlake is liquid memory, but Judd covered that up.\nHe also used ANOTHER technology to control\nthe local residents remotely. Rex admitted that\nhe continued to cover up what Judd did. But he\nknew one day that he would have to deal with\nthe consequences. J.C. Valley has to change, and\nhe understands that it's his job to do it.\n  The biggest shock was learning that Ryan wasn't\nreal. He was created by the remote ANOTHER\nsystem. Still, with the truth about everything\ncoming out, I feel like there's more hope for the\nfuture.
ACR_Characters_00482	Kate
ACR_Characters_00363	Kate Alfred
ACR_Characters_00364	  Elizabeth's mom. She was so pretty, and\napparently performed in Las Vegas. How cool!\n  But it sounds like no one's heard from her since\nshe divorced Rex and left home five years ago.\n  Elizabeth never got over it. She keeps a birthday\ncard from her mother in a music box. It's falling\napart from how frequently she reads it.\n  Kate wrote that she loves Elizabeth in the card,\nyet she went total no-contact. I wonder why...\n  I'm sure adults are all dealing with their own\nthings too, and I have to imagine walking away\nwas so hard... But I know all too well the feeling\nof loss and loneliness that Elizabeth must have\nfelt at so suddenly losing her mother. She was so\nproud of her mom... She loved her.\n  If by some chance you're still out there, Kate,\nI hope that you'll reconnect with Elizabeth. Even\nif you talk to her just one more time. After all,\nyou're her one and only mother.
ACR_Characters_00365	Princess
ACR_Characters_00366	  A large dog I found rummaging for food in the\nguesthouse along with the kid who stole my bag.\nI like dogs, but even I might retreat if one that\nbig came at me... The dog seemed pretty friendly\nwith the kid, even fleeing the guesthouse with\nhim. So maybe it's the kid's pet?
ACR_Characters_00367	  A large dog that was hanging out with Matthew.\nThey get along pretty well, but it isn't his pet.\nHe said that it just started following him around\nnear the campground. It's too well-behaved to\nbe a wild animal... So I guess someone must\nreally be worried about their lost dog right now.\nNext time I see it, I should try and befriend it\nso I can give it all the cuddles.
ACR_Characters_00368	  A large dog that was hanging out with Matthew.\nShe's super friendly—we became fast friends! I\ncan't get over how fluffy her white fur feels. I\ncould get lost in it and pet her forever. Her name\nis Princess, according to her collar. Which means\nshe definitely has an owner. But there's no sign\nof them... Is she lost, or did she run away?
ACR_Characters_00369	  A large dog with fluffy white fur. She's a dear\nfriend I made at the lake. We couldn't figure out\nwho she belongs to, but apparently she's\nElizabeth's. Janet said she was living with\nElizabeth's mom. But if Princess is hanging\naround here now, it must mean she ran away\nto see Elizabeth.\n  She's grown so much since she was just a puppy.\nBut it seems she hasn't forgotten Elizabeth or\nhow much she loves her.
ACR_Characters_00370	  A large dog with fluffy white fur. She's a dear\nfriend I made at the lake. She's Elizabeth's pet,\nbut was supposed to be living with her mom.\nShe's been wandering around Lake Juliet for\nthe past few days. On top of that, she snuck into\nthe guesthouse with Matthew and managed to\nget some food from Charlotte.\n  What did you come here for, Princess? Was it\nto see Elizabeth?
ACR_Characters_00371	  A large dog with fluffy white fur. She's a dear\nfriend I made at the lake. When Matthew ran out\nof the clock tower, I went after him and wound up\nbumping into Princess and Elizabeth. I guess she\nhad come here to see Elizabeth after all. I'm glad\nyou two were able to reunite, Princess.\n  I really owe this pooch my thanks. If it wasn't for\nher, I don't think my relationship with Elizabeth\nwould have improved as much as it has. We\nstarted out pretty hostile, but now we can talk\nopenly. It's thanks to Princess I was able to\nmake another good friend!
ACR_Characters_00483	Janet
ACR_Characters_00372	Janet Rice
ACR_Characters_00373	  The drummer in Tommy's band.\n  I saw her a few times near the campground, but\ndidn't know who she was then. When I finally\ntalked to her, I realized she's really friendly and\nfun to be around. Maybe that's why she gets\nalong with Elizabeth so well... She can see\nElizabeth's good side, while taking her spoiled\nside in stride.\n  She has a really big heart too. She must, given\nhow long she's been friends with Elizabeth...\nThings got heated between Elizabeth and me\nafter just a minute, so Janet seems all the more\nincredible.\n  I like hanging out with her. We both love\ntalking about music, so I feel like we're going\nto be good friends.
ACR_Characters_00374	  The drummer in Tommy's band. She's really\nfriendly and fun to be around. She told me their\nband is entering the Big-Deal Band Contest.\nI'm going to enter too, but according to her,\ntheir goal isn't just to enter... She wants to enter,\nwin, and get a record deal. And winning this\ncontest is the quickest way to make that happen.\n  Tommy has different motivations, but seeing\nJanet's ambition really makes me want to dig\ndown deep and give it my all. Rock on, Janet!
ACR_Characters_00376	  The drummer in Tommy's band. She's really\nfriendly and fun to be around.\n  She told me their band is entering the Big-Deal\nBand Contest, but it looks like Elizabeth lost the\nmusic player that has the song they need for it.\nAnd what's worse, Elizabeth stopped coming to\npractice around the time they made the\nrecording. Janet and Elizabeth have been friends\nfor forever, so it's only natural Janet would be\nable to sense when something is wrong. She must\nbe so worried.\n  Janet told me how serious she is about the\ncontest. She's hoping it leads to a record deal,\nso she can't just stand by and do nothing.\n  They certainly have their challenges, and it\nseems like more keep coming out of nowhere.\nI know firsthand the struggles that can come with\nbeing in a band, so I'm really rooting for them.\nI hope they can work it all out!
ACR_Characters_00377	  The drummer in Tommy's band. She's really\nfriendly, and her natural cheerfulness is great for\nbringing people together. Every group needs a\ndependable leader who can take everyone's\nneeds into account, and that leader is Janet.\n  But despite the band contest being right around\nthe corner, they're facing a ton of challenges...\nI wound up going to Elizabeth's fancy house with\nJanet and Tommy to ask why she hasn't been\ncoming to practice, but Elizabeth was as difficult\nas ever. She refused to talk about it. But I trusted\nJanet's quick thinking and we left Tommy to\nhandle things.\n  Janet and I went to Elizabeth's room, where she\ntold me about some of the struggles Elizabeth\nhas been through.\n  Oh, that reminds me... I nearly panicked when\nJanet broke Elizabeth's music box. I was able to\nfix it, but the whole thing taught me that even\nJanet has a careless side. But thanks to all that,\nwe found the missing music player! I needed to\ngive it back, so I waited until the timing was right\nand gave it to Janet and Tommy.\n  But the conversation with Elizabeth went\nnowhere, and the core problem remains\nunresolved.\n  I wonder what will happen to their band...
ACR_Characters_00380	  The drummer in Tommy's band. She's really\nfriendly, and her natural cheerfulness is great for\nbringing people together. I'm really impressed by\nhow open-minded she is. That's actually the\nwhole reason I was able to make peace with\nElizabeth.\n  Janet told me a lot of what Elizabeth has been\nthrough, which helped me realize that we have\nmore than a few things in common. Without\nJanet, I never would have come around on\nElizabeth. So I owe her a lot.\n  I really respect her passion for music too. I\ntotally get her love for her band, and her desire\nto go pro.\n  Janet has her hands full with band issues, but\nat least it seems like Elizabeth's resolved her\npersonal issues. At this rate, I'm sure the band\nwill be back to full force in no time. Then they'll\nbe able to play in the contest they've been\nworking so hard for. Which means I'll get to\nsee them at the venue! I'm looking forward to\ntalking more about music with them. I can't wait!
ACR_Characters_00484	Charlotte
ACR_Characters_00381	Charlotte Graham
ACR_Characters_00382	  Matthew ran ahead chasing after John. When\nI went looking for him, I found myself in a big\nyard with a greenhouse and a very well-tended\ngarden. I found Matthew there, but the old lady\nwho lives there got mad at us for being on her\nproperty. We explained we weren't trying to\ncause any trouble, but the look she gave us\nwas really scary...\n  So Matthew and I got out of there as quick as\nwe could. But something's been bothering me...\nThe emblem on the door to her house. I've seen\nit somewhere before... But where?
ACR_Characters_00383	  Matthew ran ahead chasing after John. When\nI went looking for him, I found myself in a big\nyard with a well-tended garden. The door to the\nhouse caught my eye. There was an emblem\nengraved on it.\n  The relief of finding Matthew was short-lived.\nThe old lady that lives there got super mad at us\nfor going onto her property without permission.\nI explained our situation, hoping that would help,\nbut she gave us this hard stare. She was pretty\nscary, if I'm being honest. I was worried she\nmight yell at us some more, so Matthew and I\ngot out of there.\n  But the emblem on her door is still bothering\nme... I've seen it somewhere before. But where?
ACR_Characters_00384	  The old lady whose family has lived in Lake\nJuliet for generations. She knows a lot about\nthe area.\n  I was scared of her the first time we met,\nbecause of how angry she got at us. But she's\nactually not all that scary. She invited Matthew\nand me into her house and gave us some\ndelicious homemade tea.\n  She told us about what happened with the\nwater pollution five years ago. At first, the locals\nwere in favor of the resort's development. But\nonce the article about the pollution came out, it's\nlike a switch was flipped and everyone was\naggressively against it. It's almost like they were\nbeing controlled by someone, turning against the\nresort overnight. The Crusoe Resort name didn't\neven appear in the article, so why did Matthew's\ndad wind up in the cross hairs?\n  Matthew wants to go into the clock tower, so\nwe asked Charlotte to let us in. We found the\nthree keys she told us about, so we can go.
ACR_Characters_00385	  The old lady whose family has lived in Lake\nJuliet for generations. She knows a lot about\nthe area.\n  When I first met her, she got really mad at\nMatthew and me being in her yard. I thought she\nwas scary, but then she gave us this amazing\nhomemade tea and told us all sorts of stories.\nI really owe Charlotte a lot. Most importantly,\nMatthew got his memories back thanks to her\nletting us into the clock tower. Thank you,\nCharlotte.\n  That reminds me... While searching for the keys\nto the clock tower, we found a letter from her\ndaughter Olivia. I couldn't interpret the look on\nCharlotte's face as I read it to her... They had a\nfight some time ago and hadn't spoken to each\nother since. But I guess Charlotte never stopped\nworrying about her daughter.\n  The letter said Olivia was pregnant, and I'm sure\nCharlotte wants to see her grandchild. I could tell\nshe was at least a little happy when she learned\nthe news. I hope she gets to see her grandchild,\nand I hope she gets a chance to talk to Olivia\nand repair their relationship.
ACR_Characters_00386	  The old lady whose family has lived in Lake\nJuliet for generations. She knows a lot about\nthe area.\n  We were able to solve the clock tower's puzzle\nand ring the bell. It was so loud, Charlotte must\nhave heard it. But Matthew disappeared again,\nso I had to chase after him.\n  Charlotte was in her garden when I got to her\nhouse. I was right about her having heard the\nbell. She told me it was wonderful to hear it\nagain. When I asked her about Matthew, she\nsaid that I could get to the Crusoe Resort\noffices by going through the big pipe under\nthe bridge.\n  I owe Charlotte for so much. I need to\nmake sure I stop by her place later to\nthank her properly.
ACR_Characters_00485	Olivia
ACR_Characters_00387	Olivia Graham
ACR_Characters_00388	  Charlotte's daughter, who left home and\neloped.\n  She returned to her family home broken-\nhearted after her first marriage ended in divorce.\nBut then she met Gilbert, a photographer who\nhad moved to Lake Juliet. The two fell in love.\n  Olivia wanted to marry Gilbert, but her mother\nwas against it. They never reached an\nunderstanding, so Olivia and Gilbert eloped\nand then disappeared. She and Charlotte lost\nall contact.\n  I always thought people only eloped on TV or\nin movies. It always seemed so romantic that\ntwo people could be so in love they just run off\nand get married, but I guess the reality is a lot\nmore complicated than that... I wonder if Olivia\nmisses her mom. Charlotte's clearly worried\nabout her.
ACR_Characters_00389	  Charlotte's daughter.\n  She fell in love with Gilbert, a photographer\nwho moved to Lake Juliet. They eloped because\nCharlotte didn't approve of their relationship.\n  There are three keys for the clock tower, and\nOlivia was in charge of one of them. But with her\nbeing gone, nobody knew where it was. All I\ncould do was ask Charlotte if she had any hints\nto where it could be.\n  She told me Olivia left a strange box in the\ngreenhouse in the yard. We found a letter in the\nbox, along with the Flower Key!\n  In the letter, Olivia shared her honest thoughts,\nas well as an apology she couldn't say to\nCharlotte in person. She also wrote that she\nwas pregnant. I'm so glad we were able to let\nCharlotte know all about what Olivia was feeling.\n  We wouldn't have the Flower Key had Olivia not\nleft that letter behind. Thanks, Olivia!
ACR_Characters_00486	Gilbert
ACR_Characters_00390	Gilbert Moss
ACR_Characters_00391	  A famous photographer.\n  He moved to Lake Juliet from New York nine\nyears ago, but then just up and left one day. He\nabandoned his house, didn't even take his stuff\nwith him. And the reason why? He eloped!\nSeriously.\n  I've only ever heard of that happening on TV.\nThe idea of dropping everything and running\noff for love seems so romantic, I couldn't help\nbut get caught up in the drama. But whatever\nthe reason, Gilbert left an empty house, which\nprovided Matthew with a hiding spot for\nwhenever he needed to lay low.\n  There were photos of Matthew's family in the\nbasement of that house, so maybe Gilbert\nknows something about Matthew's dad.\n  I want to learn more about this photographer...
ACR_Characters_00392	  A famous photographer.\n  He moved to Lake Juliet from New York nine\nyears ago, but then just up and left one day. He\nabandoned his house, didn't even take his stuff\nwith him.\n  As to why, he met Olivia after moving to Lake\nJuliet and the two fell in love. They wanted to get\nmarried, but Charlotte was opposed. Olivia was\nalready pregnant though, so nothing could\nstop the two from being together. They eloped\nfor the sake of the child and their family.\n  According to Bob, Gilbert was a nice guy. In the\nletter we found in the greenhouse, Olivia wrote\nthat he tried working things out with Charlotte,\nso I bet Bob was right.\n  The decision to elope couldn't have been an\neasy one... It all sounds so complicated. It's hard\nfor me to understand the things adults have to\ndeal with sometimes, but I hope they're happy.
ACR_Characters_00487	Benjamin
ACR_Characters_00393	Benjamin Graham
ACR_Characters_00394	  Charlotte's father. He was a skilled clock maker\nwho built the clock tower in Lake Juliet.\n  I imagine construction was a lot harder back\nthen, so building something so colossal must\nhave felt impossible.\n  It's kind of amazing it's still standing today. Bob\ntold me how important the clock tower is to\nCharlotte.\n  But something tragic happened there five years\nago, so now it's all locked up and nobody is\nallowed inside. It's kind of sad that such a great\nlandmark has to go unused.\n  I bet the bell at the top is really loud... I wonder\nwhat it would be like to hear it ring all throughout\nLake Juliet.
ACR_Characters_00488	Robin
ACR_Characters_00395	Robin Graham
ACR_Characters_00396	  Charlotte's late husband. He was a clockmaker\nin charge of maintaining the clock tower in Lake\nJuliet.\n  No one's allowed in there these days. He held\none of the three keys needed to get in, and\naccording to Charlotte, he used to store things\nin the shed. That's a good hint! Let's check it out.
ACR_Characters_00397	  Charlotte's late husband. He was a clockmaker\nin charge of maintaining the clock tower in Lake\nJuliet.\n  These days, the tower is all locked up and no\none's allowed in. Robin held one of the three\nkeys needed to keep it running.\n  He used to store some of his stuff in his\ntoolshed, so we took a look inside and found all\nsorts of clocks. I bet he made them all himself.\n  One of them looked like a miniature version of\nthe clock tower, and the sword key was inside it!\nI'm so glad we managed to find it.\n  But, man, what an elaborate way to hide a key.\nA whole puzzle built into the hands of a clock?\nBeing able to put something like this together\nreally goes to show how skilled he was at his\ncraft. He must have been really passionate\nabout clock making.
ACR_Characters_00398	Captain
ACR_Characters_00399	  The captain of the ferry that took Jessica and\nme to Blood Edward Island two years ago. He's\nactually a lot nicer than he looks. I never thought\nI'd see him again, let alone here at Lake Juliet.\n  This picture makes him look like he's good\nfriends with Bob, but I wonder how they know\neach other. Now that I think about it, they look\nsort of similar... Could these guys be brothers?\n  That reminds me... We found an RC boat in the\nboathouse. I thought the doll in the back of it\nlooked familiar, but now I'm thinking it must have\nbeen modeled after the captain.\n  I wonder what he's up to now... I hope he's\ndoing well.
ACR_Characters_00489	Ryan
ACR_Characters_00400	Ryan Gray
ACR_Characters_00401	  Ryan gives off strange vibes... We chatted at the\ncookout after Dad left me alone.\n  He said he works with my dad and that he\nknew my mom. He told me stories from when\nMom was a scientist. There aren't many people\naside from Dad who know that much about Mom,\nso I was pretty happy to hear his stories.\n  But then I told him about my dream of being in\na band, and he said that even though I look like\nmy mom, I'm more like my dad on the inside.\nWhich, I mean... What did he mean by that?!\n  We talked about a few different things, but he\ndisappeared as soon as I stepped away from him.\nI wonder if I'll see him again... I'd like to hear\nmore about Mom.
ACR_Characters_00402	  I ran into Ryan again on the way to my dad's\ncottage. The cottage he invited me into was\nsuper clean. The exact opposite of Dad's mess.\n  Ryan knows that I've been running all around\nthe lake. I wonder when he saw me... When he\nsaw me looking at the kaleidoscope he keeps by\nthe window, he told me it was a memento of his\nmother who died when he was little.\n  As a child he was sick and required painful\ntreatments. My mom was there after each session,\nwaiting by his side with the kaleidoscope. She'd\ncheer him up by telling him, "You were so brave,\nRyan. Your mom was watching over you. I'm sure."\n  He said that whenever my mom looked into the\nkaleidoscope, the cherry blossom inside would\nmake her feel nostalgic for Japan. But now it's\nbroken and you can't see it... That's too bad.\nI would have loved to see.\n  Ryan said he was glad that we could talk, just\nthe two of us. But I was just happy to hear some\nnew stories about Mom.\n  Now that I think about it, I wonder what he\nmeant when he said that the reason I came to\nLake Juliet is because there's "someone waiting\nhere" for me. Who could possibly be here waiting\nfor me?
ACR_Characters_00403	  Ryan was waiting for me in the ANOTHER room.\nBack in the cottage, when you said there was\nsomeone waiting for me... It was you, Ryan.\nWasn't it?\n  He tried to use the ANOTHER to revive Mom\nin my body, but a feature she designed for the\nRAS stopped him. I'll never forgive him for what\nhe did in his attempt to bring my mom back.\nThough, I think I do get how he feels... At least\na little.\n  I mean, I wish my mom would come back too.\nBut she told me, "I have no intention of letting\nthat happen. I won't allow it."\n  Of course... Mom could never be happy coming\nback if it meant sacrificing me. She couldn't grant\nyour wish of seeing her again, Ryan, but if you\nreally do care about her... Then I hope you can\nunderstand how she felt.
ACR_Characters_00404	  We learned the truth about Ryan on the small\nisland in the lake. The Ryan that appeared to me\nwas a "conscious life-form" born from the memory\ndata left by Judd's son Ryan.\n  He was controlling Bill and Sofia in order to\ncomplete the ANOTHER, but I still don't think I\ncan forgive them for what they've done. And the\nreason he went through all of this was to see my\nmom... He just wanted to see the first person who\nnoticed his existence, and the only one who\nremembered him.\n  But Mom wouldn't allow it. She left me the RAS,\nwhich has the ability to stop memories from being\noverwritten. She told me what Ryan was doing is\nwrong.\n  You don't have to do things like that, Ryan.\nEven if the lake cleansing itself causes your\nconsciousness to disappear, Mom and I will both\nremember you. We'll remember that you existed.\nAnd from now on, you'll live inside my heart,\nalongside memories of my mom. You'll be a\npart of my precious memories forever.
ACR_Characters_00490	Ian
ACR_Characters_00405	Ian Tyler
ACR_Characters_00406	  Ian is another researcher who works with Dad.\nHe seemed pretty into his conversation with his\ncoworker, Gina, while they were prepping the\ncookout. They were talking about memory\nmechanisms, neural pathways, or...some...real\ncomplicated science-sounding stuff.\n  I didn't feel comfortable butting into their\nconversation. Do all scientists constantly have\nresearch on their minds? Here I was thinking\nthat was just Dad.
ACR_Characters_00407	  Ian is another researcher who works with Dad.\nWhen I brought the charcoal, he noticed I was\nlooking for Dad and told me he ran off to J.C.\nValley to deal with some lab emergency.\nLeft me all alone again...\n  But Ian praised him, saying he couldn't believe\nhe went back to the lab without eating after\nspending all morning prepping the food. I guess\nI get him admiring my dad's dedication to his\nwork, but he also left his daughter at a cookout\nwith total strangers.
ACR_Characters_00408	  Ian is another researcher who works with Dad.\nWhile cleaning up after the cookout, he noticed\nDad forgot his hat so he asked me to bring it to\nhis cottage. I bet Dad's doing stuff like this all the\ntime... Forgetting things and imposing on\neveryone else for help.\n  Ian told me how to find the cottage, and also\nwarned me to stay away from the out-of-service\nboathouse. But then I met Matthew and we\nwound up sneaking in. I don't want Ian to worry,\nso maybe I just won't tell him I went inside...
ACR_Characters_00409	  Ian is another researcher who works with Dad...\nOr so I thought.\n  So this guy John, who goes around calling\nhimself a special agent, was talking to someone\non the phone who he called Ian. They were\ntalking about Dad and J.C. Valley, so there's\nno doubt in my mind that it's the same Ian.\n  From what I gathered, Ian and John share some\nconnection. They're working together on an\ninvestigation of the Crusoe Resort incident and\nJ.C. Valley. Who are these guys, really?
ACR_Characters_00410	  Ian is another researcher who works with Dad.\nWhen we couldn't get ahold of him in the lab,\nGina and I went to his office and found him on\nthe floor. He had been knocked out, but he was\nOK. What a relief... I couldn't stand it if anyone\nelse got hurt.\n  On our way to the security office to look for\nDad, I learned the truth about Ian. And to my\nabsolute surprise, he's actually a special agent!\nHe went undercover to investigate J.C. Valley's\nmemory research. I guess special agents really\ndo exist.\n  We didn't find Dad at the security office, but we\ndid find that someone had hacked into and\ndisabled the surveillance system. Ian was able to\nfix it, which let us see that Dad was being held in\nthe liquid memory storage room. After that,\nwe were able to rescue him.\n  I was surprised enough at hearing Ian's a\nspecial agent, but I was just as amazed to see\nhis skills as a technician at work.
ACR_Characters_00491	Sofia
ACR_Characters_00411	Sofia Callaghan
ACR_Characters_00412	  A researcher at J.C. Valley. She's one of Dad's\ncoworkers.\n  She was the first person I met at the cookout\nDad invited me to. She has a grown-up sort of\nelegance and a real beauty to her. But she also\nseems a little hard to approach.\n  Even if my first impression of her is wrong, she\nwas talking to Rex about work the whole time, so\nI never had the chance to say hi.\n  Ugh. If I knew I was going to be this bored, I\nwould have used this time for guitar practice. I\nwish I'd turned down Dad's invitation.
ACR_Characters_00413	  A researcher at J.C. Valley. She's one of Dad's\ncoworkers.\n  She was the first person I met at the cookout\nDad invited me to. She has a grown-up sort of\nelegance and a real beauty to her. But she also\nseems a little hard to approach.\n  Even if my first impression of her is wrong, she\nwas talking to Rex about work the whole time\nand I didn't have the courage to butt in. But she\nworks with Dad, so I should really try to say hi\nto her at some point...\n  But how should I go about approaching her?\nWhat if she doesn't want to talk to me? I guess\nI won't know until I try, but it makes me a little\nnervous...
ACR_Characters_00414	  A researcher at J.C. Valley. She's one of Dad's\ncoworkers.\n  She's pretty shady, according to Elizabeth. She's\nengaged to Elizabeth's dad but doesn't seem like\nshe really loves him. Why would she agree to\nmarry someone she doesn't love?\n  I think I can understand how Elizabeth feels...\nWelcoming someone you don't trust into your\nfamily must be hard.\n  She didn't seem like a bad person when I met\nher at the campsite, but that's all changed now.\nOnly a truly bad person could draw someone in\nwith a smile only to immediately attack them.\n  She's the worst kind of person. But why would\nshe attack me? What's she after?
ACR_Characters_00415	  A researcher at J.C. Valley. She's one of Dad's\ncoworkers.\n  I never thought she would attack me! At first, I\ndidn't believe Gina when she told me Sofia was\ntrying to steal data from the lab. But then Sofia\nattacked Ian, and she came after Gina and me\nwith a gun! I guess seeing is believing, but I\ncould have done without seeing all that...\n  On top of this, I found my bag in Sofia's office.\nShe was the one who tricked Matthew into\nstealing it from me. All my stuff was there, so she\ndidn't actually take anything, but did she really\nhave to throw it all in the garbage? Talk about\nadding insult to injury.\n  Helping Ian lock her in her office felt pretty\nnice, not gonna lie. I felt like I was able to get\nback at her, in some small way.\n  But despite our efforts, she somehow managed\nto escape. She held Dad and me at gunpoint\nand demanded we give her the ANOTHER's\nsource code. But we can't let her have her way.\nWe'll never give something so important to\nsomeone like you, Sofia!
ACR_Characters_00416	  A researcher at J.C. Valley. She's one of Dad's\ncoworkers...and also an agent of the organization\nthat sent Bill to steal the ANOTHER data!\n  Sofia was Ryan's accomplice, but their goals\ncouldn't have been more different. The reason\nSofia wanted the ANOTHER data was simple:\nShe wanted to sell it for a boat-load of cash.\nHarming so many people, using my mom's\nresearch for such selfish purposes... I can't\nforgive that.\n  We all banded together and were able to\ncapture Sofia. We can breathe a bit easier now,\nbut we don't know when someone will come for\nthe ANOTHER next.\n  I'll never let anyone use it for selfish reasons.\nNot after Mom sacrificed her own memories to\nseal it away. I'll make sure her final wishes are\nrespected.
ACR_Characters_00492	Gina
ACR_Characters_00417	Gina Barnes
ACR_Characters_00418	  Gina is another one of Dad's researcher\ncolleagues. She was talking about nerve cells\nor something with her coworker Ian at the\nbarbecue. It didn't seem like something I wanted\nto interrupt—they were so into whatever they\nwere saying. I guess they must really love what\nthey do, enough to keep talking about it at\na barbecue.
ACR_Characters_00419	  Gina is another one of Dad's researcher\ncolleagues. She's the nice one who invited me\nto join her at the barbecue so I wouldn't be alone\nwhen Dad had to leave suddenly.\n  It seems like she and Ian get along really well,\nbut I don't really understand any of what they\nsay to each other, with all the science stuff.\n  I guess Dad said I should eat his portion of the\nfood, but it's way too much for one person.
ACR_Characters_00420	  Gina is another one of Dad's researcher\ncolleagues. When I needed to take Dad's hat\nback to him, she jumped in to remind Ian to be\nspecific with his instructions, since I'd never been\nhere. She also told me that there was some\nshady guy in sunglasses hanging around the\nboathouse, so I was ready to hide right away\nwhen I saw him by the lakeshore.\n  Gina's great. She's kind and considerate—the\nkind of person I want to be as an adult.
ACR_Characters_00421	  Gina is another one of Dad's researcher\ncolleagues. She came to my rescue in the lab\nafter I escaped from the underground storage\narea. I was confused at first, because I thought\nshe was with Sofia and I couldn't trust her at all.\nThen I calmed down and heard her out, and\nrealized that she and Dad and Ian were trying\nto protect the ANOTHER data Sofia wanted.\nAnd then Sofia caught up with us and pulled out\na gun, Gina still protected me, getting shot in\nthe process. She's not just kind, she's also really\nbrave. I should never have doubted her.
ACR_Characters_00493	Judd
ACR_Characters_00422	Judd Fitzgerald
ACR_Characters_00423	  The founder of J.C. Valley where Dad works,\nand Mom's first mentor when she started working\non memory. If he was her mentor, does that mean\nhe was also a scientist? What kind of person was\nhe, really? He might also know lots of stuff about\nMom, maybe even things Dad doesn't know.\nI should ask him, if I get the chance.
ACR_Characters_00424	  Judd was the director of M.J. Labs, which was\nthe predecessor of J.C. Valley. Apparently that's\nwhere he started something called the E.C.\nProject with Rex, Mom, and Dad, who had just\ngraduated from college. So he knew everyone\nfrom way back. I wonder what he's doing now.\nIs he still at J.C. Valley?
ACR_Characters_00425	  When I saw Judd's portrait, I realized he was\nthe person I remembered arguing with Mom 13\nyears ago. Why was Judd so desperate to finish\nthe ANOTHER that he'd just ignore Mom's\nwarnings? Did he have some special reason\nto push so hard?
ACR_Characters_00426	  The thing I saw 13 years ago was the prototype\nANOTHER, developed by Mom and Judd, but\nit still wasn't finished at the time. Judd's son,\nRyan, died in those early ANOTHER experiments.\nThat machine was supposed to be destroyed 15\nyears ago, but Judd held onto it in secret. Then\nhe called Mom to J.C. Valley to finish it so he\ncould use it to bring his son Ryan back to life.\nMom wouldn't do it, so Judd stole her memories\nof her work. How tragic that Mom would lose\nher memories like that, and then her life, over\nthis machine.
ACR_Characters_00427	  On Ryan's grave on the island in the lake, Judd\nhad hidden his "most precious possession." It was\na little locket, with a picture of Ryan smiling\ninside. The thing Judd loved more than anything\nwas his son. He loved Ryan with his whole heart,\nand wanted to save him from the trauma he'd\nalready lived through. That's why he was\ndesperate enough to try using ANOTHER\nbefore it was ready. He just wanted to bring\nRyan back with the data from the liquid memory.\nJust like my dad, Judd was a kind father who\nloved his family and would have done anything\nfor them.
ACR_Characters_00494	Bill
ACR_Characters_00428	Bill Edward
ACR_Characters_00429	  The man who stole my mother's life 13 years\nago. Bill fell off a cliff on Blood Edward Island\nand died, but he had already sent the ANOTHER\ndata that Dad had finished to J.C. Valley. Dad\nfigured out that the person Bill was working with...\nwas Ryan. I can't believe it! Ryan had been so\nnice to me... I don't want to believe it.
ACR_Characters_00430	  Just like Dad said, Bill and Ryan were working\ntogether. Ryan said they weren't really working\ntogether, but in the end they stole ANOTHER\ndevelopment data from Dad, so the details are\nkind of beside the point.\n  This is the first time in two years that I've\ntalked about Bill. The memory of him is still pretty\npainful. We'll never know what was really going\non with him, but I wonder if he had a reason for\nwhat he did.
ACR_Characters_00495	Dan
ACR_Characters_00431	Dan Maxwell
ACR_Characters_00432	  Dan is a forest ranger in charge of the area\naround Lake Juliet. He does a lot of stuff like\nwatching the state of the forest and posting signs\nabout cleanup activities. It seems like he's been\ndoing this job for a long time, and knows\neverybody around here.\n  Dan was worried about me when he saw that I\nwas upset, and when I told him that a boy stole\nmy bag, he was really kind and listened to what\nI had to say, which was nice. He said he's keep\nan eye out while he's on patrol, so maybe I'll get\nmy bag back after all!
ACR_Characters_00433	  Dan spoke to me at the campsite. When he\nshowed me a picture of Matthew, and I confirmed\nthat he was the one who stole my bag, he told\nme that Matthew had run away from home three\ndays ago, not for the first time. Dan said he's\nbeen asked to find him. At the time, I didn't know\nanything about Matthew, and I thought he was\njust a runaway troublemaker, but I was wrong. He\nhad good reasons for running away.\n  When Dan came to the boathouse, Matthew\nwas actually with me, and I felt a little bad for\nnot saying anything. But I wanted to help\nMatthew, because I know what it's like to want\nto see your dad. I was really nervous talking to\nDan, but I did find out some stuff about Lake\nJuliet, like the clock tower and Michael's\ncompany, Crusoe Resort, so it was a good thing\nin the end that I talked to him.
ACR_Characters_00434	  Everyone around here knows Matthew. After all,\nhe's the son of the president of Crusoe Resort,\nso he's supposed to the bad-guy polluter. At least,\nthat's what Elizabeth thinks. That's probably also\nwhy Dan knows about Matthew, and maybe what\nDan meant about having his reasons for running\naway. But they're all wrong. Matthew and I\nfigured out that there is no connection between\nCrusoe Resort and the pollution.\n  I wish I could tell Dan what we found, but we\ncan't let him know Matthew is with me, so I guess\nit has to stay secret for now.
ACR_Characters_00435	  I feel like I'm always making extra work for Dan.\nEven though he helped me look for my stolen\nbag, I lied to him when we snuck into the\nboathouse. And even though he told me to tell\nhim if I found Matthew, I kept it a secret the\nwhole time. Sorry, Dan. But he seems like the \nsort of cheerful guy that would just laugh and\nsay "All's well that ends well!" ...I hope.\n  Dan, I'm sure being a forest ranger is hard work,\nand I hope you keep taking care of Lake Juliet,\neven if some teenage girls accidentally make it\nharder for you!
ACR_Characters_00496	John
ACR_Characters_00436	John Smith
ACR_Characters_00497	Greg
ACR_Characters_00437	Greg Davis
ACR_Characters_00438	  A suspicious-seeming guy in a black suit and\nsunglasses, which is practically the uniform of a\nsuspicious guy.\n  He must be the one that Ian and Gina warned\nme about at the campsite. Tommy also\nmentioned this guy, and it does seem weird that\nyou would wear a suit to go camping. So what's\nhis deal? I'm super curious, but Gina and Ian told\nme to stay away, so I'll stay focused on the boy\nwho stole my bag.
ACR_Characters_00439	  A suspicious-seeming guy in a black suit and\nsunglasses.\n  When Gina and Ian asked me to take Dad's\nhat back to him, they warned me to be careful\nabout this creepy guy hanging around the area.\nWhen I spotted him, he sure didn't look like a\nlocal, so I figured this was who they were talking\nabout.\n  Matthew's been keeping tabs on him, I guess\nbecause he thinks that the guy might be\nconnected to his dad's disappearance, but\nsnooping around the lake doesn't prove anything.\nHe seems less like a culprit and more like a\ndetective or somebody following the case, but\nthat's just a gut feeling. Who is he? What's he\ndoing here? And is he connected to Matthew's\ndad somehow?
ACR_Characters_00440	  The suspicious guy came up to me and\nintroduced himself as John Smith, which is like\nannouncing "This is a fake name." He claims he's\na special agent for some "investigation service,"\nbut I don't really buy it. But he does know about\nMatthew, and also about me, which is creepy.\n  He says he's investigating the incident five years\nago, so I asked him what he's learned. He\nwouldn't tell me, and instead gave me a line\nabout how some truths are better left unknown.\nThen he told me to give Matthew the same\nwarning, but why me? Tell him yourself, creep.\n  Matthew is sure that this guy is behind\neverything, but I think that's just based on his\nsuspicious appearance. Talking to him, I don't\nthink he's necessarily a bad guy, but he's\nobviously not being honest.
ACR_Characters_00441	  The guy who claims to be a special agent for\nthe government. He definitely doesn't fit in at\nthe campground, with this black suit, so everyone\nthinks he's super suspicious. He says he's looking\ninto the incident from five years ago, and I heard\nhim mention "Crusoe Resort" to someone on the\nphone. It also looks like he's investigating J.C.\nValley, where Dad works. It definitely seems like\nMatthew's dad's disappearance is related to the\nlake pollution, but could J.C. Valley be\nconnected? We could figure it out faster if this\nguy would tell us what he knows, but he says to\nlet the adults handle it. Whatever.\n  Matthew's on the clock, and we've already\nfound some clues, so we're going to keep looking\ninto this, regardless of what the adults say.
ACR_Characters_00442	  There was an article about the water pollution\nin the closed-off offices of Crusoe Resort. The\nauthor's name was Greg Davis, and he turns out\nto be our "John Smith" in sunglasses.\n  He used to live in Lake Juliet, and was an old\nfriend of Matthew's dad, Michael. Even though\nhe actually knew Matthew, he hid his true identity\nout of concern for Matthew, who lost his memory\nafter a tragic accident. It was a lie, but a lie out\nof kindness.\n  Greg's article had the oppositive of his intended\neffect, driving Crusoe Resort to the brink of\nbankruptcy. Michael had been framed, and was\nclearly suffering, so Greg was searching for the\ntruth to clear his name. We found the proof we\nneeded in Michael's locker, and Greg was\nthrilled, saying this would prove Michael's\ninnocence.\n  And that was when we found out where Michael\nwas, and now Matthew can finally see his dad!\nI love a happy ending.
ACR_Characters_00443	  The newspaper reporter who'd been\ninvestigating the true cause of the Lake Juliet\npollution for the past five years. He was lurking\naround the campground in a black suit and\nsunglasses, and I was really suspicious of him\nuntil we found out who he was.\n  I'll bet Greg is about to publish a new article\nwith the truth we just learned about the lake\npollution. And once that's out in the world, it\nwill clear Matthew's dad's name. I look forward\nto reading it.
ACR_Characters_00498	Tommy
ACR_Characters_00444	Tommy Harrison
ACR_Characters_00445	  A college student who works part-time at the\nguesthouse. I guess he knows the owner and only\nworks during school breaks.\n  I went to the guesthouse because you have to\ncheck in to get to the campground, but no one\nwas there and I was stuck. I took a peek through\nthe blinds into the storage area, and there was\nTommy, wearing headphones and in full air-guitar\nmode. He couldn't hear me, and was facing away,\nso I messed with the speaker system to play the\ncampground theme song super loud, which got\nhis attention. It was probably against the rules\nfor me to do that, but it was also against the\nrules to be ignoring customers while you're\nworking, so I guess we're even.\n  Once I got checked in and was talking with him\na bit, he mentioned some weird stuff had been\ngoing on. I was a little nervous about that, but it\nalso made me realize that Tommy pays pretty\nclose attention to what's going on around him...\nexcept his own customers. I'll keep that last part\nto myself.
ACR_Characters_00446	  A college student who works part-time at the\nguesthouse. He says he's like the chief of staff,\nbut there's no staff. He also seems to take a LOT\nof breaks.\n  When I went back to the guesthouse to get the\ncharcoal he neglected to deliver, he was missing\nin action yet again. He would never even notice\nif a thief broke in, yet he started accusing me of\nransacking the storage room! I was just chasing\nafter the kid who stole my bag, after I caught him\ndoing the ransacking.\n  Unluckiest girl in the world, now being called\na thief. Luckily I found enough evidence to prove\nmy innocence, but I hope I never have to go\nthrough that again.\n  Tommy helped me carry the charcoal back to\nthe campsite where he met up with two girls. It\nseemed like they were fighting... I hope\neverything is OK.
ACR_Characters_00447	  A college student who works part-time at the\nguesthouse.\n  Tommy's in a band with Janet and Elizabeth,\nplaying lead guitar and writing all their songs.\nJanet says he's good enough to be a pro guitarist,\nand I'm pretty impressed that he also writes the\nmusic. I guess he's also really popular with the\nfans of the band. It's weird to think that the\nslacker who's always taking breaks in the storage\nroom is, like, cool. That being said, I haven't\nheard their music, and as a fellow guitarist, I'm\nreally curious to hear how he plays.
ACR_Characters_00448	  A college student who works part-time at the\nguesthouse.\n  Tommy's in a band with Janet and Elizabeth,\nplaying lead guitar and writing their songs. I\nthought he was kind of a slacker with all the\nbreaks he takes at work, but I guess he's using\nthat time to write music. So in his own way, he's\nactually working hard. Their band is also\nentering the Big-Deal Band Contest, so I guess\nhe's just as into music as I am.\n  Unfortunately, he says Elizabeth lost the music\nplayer with the demo they recorded as their\ncontest entry. They still haven't found it, and I'd\nlove to help them look, but Elizabeth seems to\nhate my guts, so I should probably stay out of it.\nI'll just have to wish them luck.
ACR_Characters_00449	  A college student who works part-time in the\nguesthouse.\n  Tommy's in a band with Janet and Elizabeth,\nplaying lead guitar and writing their songs. Janet\ntold me he plays like a pro, but I was blown away\nby how...inspired he is! He says he's just doing it\nfor fun, but with chops like that, I think they've\ngot a real shot at winning the Big-Deal Band\nContest.\n  I borrowed a guitar and jammed with him a bit,\nbut I couldn't keep up. He complimented my\nperformance, but I could feel the difference in\nour skill levels and it made me realize how much\nmore I need to practice.\n  After that, I ran into Tommy and Janet on their\nway to Elizabeth's house, and they talked me into\ngoing with them. They want to ask her why she\nhasn't been coming to band practice, but that\nreally doesn't seem like a conversation for an\noutsider to be in, so I'm not excited about this...
ACR_Characters_00450	  A college student who works part-time in the\nguesthouse.\n  Tommy is in a band with Janet and Elizabeth,\nbut the band is in a bit of a crisis. Elizabeth lost\nthe music player with the demo they recorded\nto enter the contest, then stopped coming to\npractice. When Tommy and Janet brought me\nwith them to her house, I happened to find the\nmusic player, which I eventually gave back to\nthem. It would have been sooner, but it seemed\nlike Tommy and Elizabeth got into some kind of\nargument, and she locked herself in her room,\ncrying. I know Tommy's doing his best here, but\nI don't think yelling helped anything.\n  Tommy seems pretty clueless, and hasn't noticed\nElizabeth's feelings for him. He's also not really\ndiplomatic, so...I just have to hope this all works\nout for the best.
ACR_Characters_00453	  A college student who works part-time in the\nguesthouse, Tommy is also in a band, playing\nlead guitar and writing their songs.\n  Looking back, I went through a lot with Tommy.\nWhen I had my bag stolen and was feeling awful,\nhe was just the slacker keeping me from getting\nchecked in at the campsite. Then he accused me\nof stealing food from the storage room. I also got\nroped into his band's internal troubles. But you\nknow what? It was all worth it. Tommy is an\namazing guitar player, and under all that slacking\nand cluelessness, a good person.\n  I'm glad I came to Lake Juliet, because I've met\ncool people like Tommy. I hope to see him and\nthe others at the Big-Deal Band Contest, and\nmaybe someday be a guitar player on his level!
ACR_Characters_00499	Bob
ACR_Characters_00454	Bob Fox
ACR_Characters_00455	  The owner of the restaurant, Bob's Food Hut.\n  He seems like a great guy. I even like the way\nhe talks. Even though we've just met, I kinda feel\nlike I've known him forever and can be really\ncomfortable around him. I hope we get to talk\nmore.
ACR_Characters_00456	  The owner of the restaurant, Bob's Food Hut.\n  Apparently when there are no customers in the\nplace, he lets Tommy's band practice there. I'm\nsure they'd prefer a studio, but there's probably\nnot a lot of options around here, so it's really\nnice of him to offer a space.\n  I was hungry and ordered a Salmon Rice Burger.\nRice for the bun was a little weird, but went\nreally well with the salmon, and it was actually\ntotally delicious.\n  There are lots of pictures hung up inside the\nrestaurant, including some of Dad! Bob also let\nme put my food on Dad's tab, so it seems like\nthey're pretty close.\n  There was also a picture of Bob's food stand\nfrom before he built the restaurant...and I'd seen\nit before. According to Bob, the idea for the\nSalmon Rice Burger came from a Japanese lady\nwho visited the stand and had a kid with her.\nI think it was probably Mom! It seemed like she\nwas waiting for someone by the clock tower, but\nI have no idea who. Why did Mom come to\nLake Juliet?
ACR_Characters_00457	  The owner of the restaurant, Bob's Food Hut.\n  I was chasing after Matthew, who had run off by\nhimself, and ran into Bob making a delivery to\nCharlotte's house. He told me the "rules" for not\nmaking Charlotte mad: first, I shouldn't call her\n"miss" or "ma'am," just her name. I also shouldn't\nmention her daughter...or the clock tower. I think\nI understand the name and the daughter, but\nwhat's the problem with the clock tower? Bob\njust said it was a tragic accident and he doesn't\nlike to talk about it.\n  What happened at the clock tower five years\nago? What was so sad that no one will talk about\nit all this time later? It seems to be a sore spot\nfor absolutely everyone.
ACR_Characters_00458	  The owner of the restaurant, Bob's Food Hut.\n  The Salmon Rice Burger that Bob made for me\nwas sooooo good! I had a great time with him,\nhearing stories about Dad and how they spend\ntheir time.\n  I'm also grateful that he still remembers Mom\nall these years later. Of course, for Bob that was\nthe fateful day that inspired his famous Salmon\nRice Burger, but even so, it's nice to have this\nlittle bit of her immortalized. Anytime I want a\nmemory of Mom, I can come here and have a\nSalmon Rice Burger for her.\n  And I'll be back here to visit Dad lots, so I\nshould have lots of opportunities to put burgers\non his tab!

ACR_Richard_memo_00001	#01 Good Ol' Lake Juliet
ACR_Richard_memo_00002	 Sayoko and I visited Lake Juliet over 10 years ago. I was recently strolling around\n the lake for the first time in a while when I noticed a boathouse and cottages\n that had appeared since then. When I asked some locals about them, they said\n that five years ago, there were plans to build a major resort.\n\n Fortunately, the area around the mermaid statue on the lakeshore hasn't changed\n a bit. That was a relief to see, but it does seem like the old clock tower stopped\n working a few years ago. It makes the place feel a bit emptier.\n\n I would love to show Ashley this lake's natural beauty one more time, before\n any further development changes the landscape forever.\n \n I broke my promise to come home once a week, so I haven't had a chance to\n catch up with her. We haven't had time to talk. But since there's a campsite\n here, maybe I can invite her camping.\n\n I'll need to gather my courage to invite her, but it'll be a good chance for some\n quality time. I bet she'd enjoy a conversation over some delicious grilled food.\n I'll start making the arrangements right now.
ACR_Richard_memo_00003	#02 My Residence on Lake Juliet 
ACR_Richard_memo_00004	 When I decided to join J.C. Valley, Rex, the director, brought me here to tour\n the cottages.\n\n This cottage area was one of Crusoe Resort's large-scale projects. But because\n the plans for the overall resort failed, most of the cottages have sat uninhabited.\n Rex told me to pick whichever one I wanted and the lab would foot the bill, so I\n wound up touring several of them.\n\n All of the ones Rex recommended were too stylish for my tastes. They just didn't\n suit my lifestyle so I had a hard time choosing. Ultimately, I chose this two-story\n cottage with a quaint little fireplace, mainly because it's close to the lake.\n\n After touring the other units, I told Rex that I'd rather the other new researchers\n take the fancier places. But Rex told me not to worry about that. Apparently I'm\n the only one.\n\n It sounds like I'm J.C. Valley's sole new researcher this month. Maybe even this\n whole year.
ACR_Richard_memo_00005	#03 Rex's Worry
ACR_Richard_memo_00006	 Rex invited me out for drinks last night. He usually keeps his cool no matter how\n many he's had, but it seems he may have had one too many this time around.\n\n He told me he's considering getting remarried to a woman his daughter, Elizabeth,\n doesn't get along with.\n\n She seems to have some things in common with his daughter so Rex thinks she'll\n be able to get through to Elizabeth. But Elizabeth just won't accept her, says she\n doesn't like her attitude.\n\n Having lived in isolation for so long, I never quite developed the skills to advise\n on situations such as these... But if I was in Rex's shoes, how would I convince\n Ashley?\n\n Well, I guess there's no point in wondering about that. I can't imagine marrying\n anyone aside from Sayoko.
ACR_Richard_memo_00007	#04 A Ghost of a Music Festival
ACR_Richard_memo_00008	 Rex told me a very interesting story after a jam session at Bob's.\n\n A long time ago, Crusoe Resort planned to build a concert venue and hold a\n music festival. The theme of the festival was going to be "harmony between\n nature and music."\n\n Michael, the resort company's president, hoped to share Lake Juliet's natural\n beauty and charm. He wanted to use music to show everyone the importance\n of protecting the environment.\n\n Rex is a music lover and environmentalist himself, so he was a big fan of the plan.\n He even offered to help make it happen. I love the idea myself, so if it ever did\n come to fruition, I'd love to form a proper band with Rex and Bob and take our\n turn on stage.\n\n Unfortunately, Crusoe Resort was canned, so the plans for the music festival were\n canned too. It never became more than a dream.\n\n Rex looked sad as he thought back to those days. He said it would have been\n a festival to remember, if only they'd been able to make it happen. I wasn't even\n aware of it at the time, but I have to agree. It's so sad it could never happen.\n\n Now, a music festival on this lake is nothing more than a ghost of an idea. But\n someday, maybe I'll be able to take Ashley and Jessica to a concert or a music\n festival.\n\n I wonder what sort of music Ashley is into. I hope she's adopted my tastes.
ACR_Richard_memo_00009	#05 Rex's Achievements in Business
ACR_Richard_memo_00010	 As I was sorting through a box of lab documents Rex gave me, I happened across\n a book containing the history of J.C. Valley. Everything from its inception to now.\n As I skimmed through, I was surprised to see the policies that Rex put in place to\n keep the lab afloat following Judd's death. He had just taken over as director,\n but he really leaned into the business side of things.\n\n He trademarked an original security system that uses biometric technology, born\n from the research and development of ANOTHER, and sold it to outside firms.\n\n What's more, by having the lab assume the production of industrial goods for\n things like semiconductors used in that security system, he was able to restore\n J.C. Valley's financials. He single-handedly saved the lab from having to\n liquidate its assets, which were at risk of being sold to the highest bidder\n and ultimately lost. Including all that remains of the ANOTHER project.\n\n Much of the project's research has been lost, but what remains lives on in\n other fields of study within the lab. If the lab went bankrupt and was forced\n to sell off its assets, it would represent a huge risk. What if someone reverse\n engineered ANOTHER? Who knows what it would be used for. It can do anything\n from petty crime to starting wars. But Rex's business acumen prevented all that.\n\n As a complete business novice myself, I'm genuinely impressed by Rex's\n prowess in the field. I doubt there's anyone at J.C. Valley who even comes\n to his equal. Speaking with him, I started to wonder if I could market some\n of the technology in the DAS as an end-user product.\n\n Perhaps we could take a few key features, like the ability to take photos, or\n to capture detailed information about objects, and add them to a cell phone...\n\n That's not a bad idea. I should get Rex's opinion.
ACR_Richard_memo_00011	#06 Omen of ANOTHER's Resurrection
ACR_Richard_memo_00012	 Come September, it will have been one and a half years since I left Blood\n Edward Island.\n\n I got a call from Rex, a former coworker at M.J. Labs. He's the director of J.C.\n Valley now, and it sounds like there are those in his lab who want to revive the\n ANOTHER project. \n\n Back on the island, I interrupted Bill's transmission and was certain I had\n destroyed the ANOTHER along with its source code... But it would seem at\n least a portion of the code Bill transferred made it into someone's hands, and\n subsequently, into J.C. Valley's data-management system.\n\n Rex is looking into how the data got in. He'll try to identify anyone involved with\n it too. So far he's figured out that some of its data is in the security system, which\n he can't access himself. He has no idea what the code is doing there.\n\n He asked me to help investigate. I immediately agreed.\n\n We cannot allow the ANOTHER project to be revived, no matter the cost. I joined\n J.C. Valley so I could ensure nobody is hurt by ANOTHER, like Ashley and I were.
ACR_Richard_memo_00013	#07 A Fishing Pro and a Fishing Foe
ACR_Richard_memo_00014	 The guy in room 201 is supposed to be some sort of master fisherman. It's said\n his technique borders on the supernatural. Several of my fellow researchers want\n to learn from him, and Rex is already taking lessons...\n\n He even has someone he refers to as his "arch rival." This rival's name is Michael\n Crusoe, former president of Crusoe Resort, the company that tried to develop\n a resort at this lake five years ago.\n\n I had never heard of this legendary fisherman Crusoe before, but it sounds like\n he holds multiple records for largest fish caught in various tournaments all\n throughout the country.\n\n Michael Crusoe was born in Lake Juliet. People around here blame his company\n for the pollution, but the guy in room 201 doesn't believe it. He says it's all made\n up. As to why he believes this, he says that Crusoe is the ultimate fisherman...\n And there's simply no way someone like that would do anything to harm the\n environment.\n\n He's waiting for Crusoe to make his triumphant return to the lake. Today, as he\n meticulously polished his gear, he looked up at me and said, "I hope to face\n Michael in a fishing tourney...one of these days."
ACR_Richard_memo_00015	#08 A New feature in the DAS
ACR_Richard_memo_00016	 I developed a new feature for the DAS based on research Sayoko left behind.\n It analyzes water quality via photoanalysis.\n\n It seems Sayoko was researching how to read information from certain\n wavelengths of light. To this day, I have no idea what information she was trying\n to read or from what storage medium... But her research did spark some new\n ideas. I began wondering if I could run a photoanalysis of light reflected off a\n liquid in order to analyze the individual substances it contains.\n\n Using the scan feature of the DAS, I developed technology that can analyze which\n substances have been dissolved in water. It's as simple as taking a picture with the\n DAS camera.\n\n The scan feature of the DAS was originally designed to read information recorded\n in specific media. But this new feature may be the key to identifying the true\n source of the pollution that affected the lake five years ago.\n\n I can't help but wonder why Sayoko was trying to read information from\n wavelengths of light in the first place... I get the feeling this is a mystery that will\n go unsolved for some time yet.
ACR_Richard_memo_00017	#09 Dependable Colleagues
ACR_Richard_memo_00018	 Among my fellow researchers, Ian and Gina are particularly dependable.\n\n Ian possesses one of the sharpest minds in the lab. However, he seems to consider\n sugary snacks brain food. Now, I like sweets as much as the next guy, and I agree\n that sugar is necessary for the sort of mental tasks we undertake... But I sincerely\n worry about the man's teeth.\n\n Gina is very earnest, and capable of intense focus when it comes to her research.\n However, she'll turn that same intensity toward the private lives of those around\n her... She has told me repeatedly that I should reach out to Ashley more regularly.\n\n They both have their quirks, but they're outstanding researchers. They're quick to\n get me back on track whenever I hit a roadblock in my own work.\n\n I was all alone on Blood Edward Island. The only person I'd ever see was Bill, and\n even then, I only saw him once every few months. For the first time since Sayoko\n died 13 years ago, I'm doing research with a support team. It's been a deeply\n moving experience.\n\n The day I spent researching at M.J. Labs with Sayoko and Bill were the start of my\n life as a researcher. I still think back to those days every so often.
