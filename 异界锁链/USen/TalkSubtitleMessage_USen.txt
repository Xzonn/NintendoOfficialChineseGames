Listen to me. We don't have time.\nThe Legions are the very last hope humanity's got.
Hmph...
I really hoped you two wouldn't get caught up in all this. Damn it, Commander...
I'll keep 'em busy.
What in the hell was that...
Olive, the override release command! Hurry!
... Hmm. That will do.\nLet's consider this their field test.
What's going on?! Commander!
Dad...!?
Jin!
You cannot expect them to fight chimeras on their own. This is an order, Captain.
I've been waiting for you.
Now don't go dying on me!
Activate the Astral Chain. Engage the restraints.
Brenda, humankind no longer has any more time to waste on useless formalities.

Advent Protocol complete.
Your brother... Akira.\nKeep him safe... you... you got it?
But sir, we haven't even briefed them on the project...
Not... today...!
Captain! Let me help you!
Don't worry. I'll be back. I promise.
I've already taken the liberty of filing for their transfer to Neuron.
Core released.
Do that for me.
Let's begin.
It's gonna take a while to get used to all this. But I'm sure we can show Dad that we're up to it.
Grrrraaaah!
Dad! ... Dad!
Augh!
What is this thing?
Doctor, we've just received reports from the police of a confirmed gate opening in Central City.
Grahh!
Akira. You keep everyone safe, okay?
Core released.
Captain, are you serious?
Well... Gotta say... It's nice working with you.
A fatal fatal fata... error error error err... Errrrr...
Dad! ... Dad!
Grrrraaaah!

Your sister... Akira.\nKeep her safe... you... you got it?

Aiieee!
Akira. You keep everyone safe, okay?
Doctor, we've just received reports from the police of a confirmed gate opening in Central City.
What is this thing?
Augh!
Don't worry about calibration, I've already loaded their personnel data into those devices.
Gah!
I understand...
You're late, newbie!
Where in the hell did they come from?
That's impossible...
Yes, they have, but they're not from our usual channels. They're two new officers who just joined criminal affairs.
No use!\nThe override release isn't going through!
Akira, stop! Stop!
Never mind that.\nIf they were to fail now, we couldn't use them anyway.
Augh!
Hmmm.
Max, you must let them use the Legatus.
Chained Legion.
If you say so.
And today we lost all of 'em. Except yours.\nWe can't risk losing that too.
Nnngh!
Understood. The particle gun is online and ready to fire. Whenever you're ready.
Brenda. Where are the two new candidates now?
That "thing" will let you use a Legion of your own.

It figures we'd even get transferred to a new department together.
You come with me. Let's take these bastards out.
Ngh... This is bad...\nWe're almost out of time...
All available officers have been sent to investigate. I assume the twins are no different.
ID code confirmed.
A fatal error has occurred.
W-Wait a minute, Commander, what the hell're you sayin'?
Let go! LET ME GO!
Better put the reunion on hold.
A fatal... error... has... occurred...
Prime core fully seated.
Let's go!
Akira!
It feels kinda weird to be saying this to my own sister, but...
Starting up.
But... Dad...
Go. And remember what happened here. It'll make you stronger.
Well then. Have the next candidates been chosen?
Stabilized.
You're the one who's gotta save the world now.\n... But for now... Just do me one favor.
Activity levels at 35.72... 36.18... 37.95...\nNo sign of chimeric transformation.
Jin! What're you—Let me go! Let me GO!
If we work hard, I know he'll come around in no time.
Do you want to lose the captain for NOTHING?
Engaging Advent Protocol.
GO!
I've seen their test results, and frankly, doctor, none of our other candidates come close.
Just in time, huh?
They're... They're captain Max's children.\nThe twin orphans he took in.
Starting up.
Let's go!
