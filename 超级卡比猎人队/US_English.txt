StoryText.msbt
StoryText_01	Long, long ago, in a faraway realm, there was\na beautiful, peaceful land called the {c[ff4600]}Dream\nKingdom{c[000000]}. One surprising day, {c[ff4600]}Hornhead{c[000000]}\nwent on a rampage across the {c[ff4600]}Seaside{c[000000]}.\x0e\0\x04\0And so it came to pass that {c[ff4600]}Team Kirby\n{c[000000]}set off on an adventure to restore peace\nto the kingdom...
StoryText_02	A sword-wielding suit of armor stands in \nTeam Kirby's way as they head through\n{c[ff4600]}The Dunes{c[000000]}. Watch out—this foe carries a\nflaming sword! Fight through this {c[ff4600]}ordeal{c[000000]}!
StoryText_03	Team Kirby triumphed in its first {c[ff4600]}ordeal{c[000000]},\nopening a new path to the {c[ff4600]}Ruins{c[000000]}\nand revealing new quests.\x0e\0\x04\0With no time to feed their rumbling\nbellies, the heroes press onward to the\n{c[ff4600]}Ruins{c[000000]} to investigate the mysterious\ngoings-on there.
StoryText_04	Team Kirby's investigations turned up rumors\nof a strange, {c[ff4600]}caped man{c[000000]}. Sensing mischief,\nthe team followed his footprints and arrived\nat the {c[ff4600]}Ruins{c[000000]} on a dark night...
StoryText_05	Team Kirby managed to defeat the {c[ff4600]}caped\nman{c[000000]}. Unfortunately, he fled to the other\nside of the {c[ff4600]}Volcano{c[000000]}...\x0e\0\x04\0In pursuit of the {c[ff4600]}caped man{c[000000]}, and to protect\nthe kingdom from other rampaging enemies,\nTeam Kirby heads to a new area, the\n{c[ff4600]}Volcano{c[000000]}.
StoryText_06	A suit of blue armor wielding an ice\nblade appeared suddenly at the {c[ff4600]}Seaside{c[000000]}!\nBe sure to check your gear before you\novercome this {c[ff4600]}ordeal{c[000000]}!
StoryText_07	Team Kirby deftly cleared the third {c[ff4600]}ordeal{c[000000]}.\nBut the problem of the ongoing rampages\ncontinued.\x0e\0\x04\0As they chased rumors of the mysterious\n{c[ff4600]}caped man {c[000000]}who seemed to be involved,\nTeam Kirby continued to fight for the\npeople of the kingdom.
StoryText_08	In the heart of a red-hot {c[ff4600]}Volcano{c[000000]}, the frog\nof flames, {c[ff4600]}Pyribbit{c[000000]}, leapt from the roiling\nmagma. Team Kirby faced its fourth {c[ff4600]}ordeal{c[000000]}!
StoryText_09	Team Kirby extinguished the frog of flames\nand cleared their fourth {c[ff4600]}ordeal{c[000000]}. They then \nmoved on to the {c[ff4600]}Empyrean{c[000000]}, where even\nmore challenging battles awaited.
StoryText_10	Team Kirby at last discovered the {c[ff4600]}caped\nman{c[000000]}'s hiding place in the {c[ff4600]}Empyrean{c[000000]}!\x0e\0\x04\0They prepared for battle and stormed into\nhis location, but something seemed...off?
StoryText_11	The {c[ff4600]}caped man{c[000000]} that had appeared in the\n{c[ff4600]}Empyrean {c[000000]}wasn't Parallel Nightmare, but the\npuppeteer magician {c[ff4600]}Taranza{c[000000]}!\x0e\0\x04\0After {c[ff4600]}Taranza{c[000000]} regained his senses, Team\nKirby bid him farewell and continued their\npursuit of the real {c[ff4600]}caped man{c[000000]} behind it all.
StoryText_12	At long last, Team Kirby found the wizard\nfrom another world. They moved swiftly to\ndeal with the {c[ff4600]}mastermind{c[000000]} that had rained\nconfusion on the kingdom!
StoryText_13	Just as Team Kirby came within reach,\n{c[ff4600]}Parallel Nightmare{c[000000]} disappeared yet again\nwith a wave of his sinister cape!\x0e\0\x04\0Team Kirby gave chase to another new area,\nthe {c[ff4600]}Decisive Battlefield{c[000000]}, where only the\nmightiest dared to tread.
StoryText_14	Team Kirby finally caught up with the foul\nmastermind, {c[ff4600]}Parallel Nightmare{c[000000]}, at the\n{c[ff4600]}Decisive Battlefield{c[000000]}, where all things come\nto an end.\x0e\0\x04\0As both sides readied themselves for battle,\nan uncharacteristic smile crept up around\nthe corner of the villain's mouth. {c[ff4600]}Team Kirby\n{c[000000]}wondered what he was {c[ff4600]}planning{c[000000]}...
StoryText_15	The king of darkness, {c[ff4600]}King D-Mind{c[000000]}, called\nfrom another world by {c[ff4600]}Parallel Nightmare{c[000000]},\nwas defeated by the four members of\nTeam Kirby.\x0e\0\x04\0Peace had finally returned to the {c[ff4600]}Dream Kingdom{c[000000]}.\n\nBut those quiet days didn't last...\nEnemy rampages mysteriously resumed!\x0e\0\x04\0Was {c[ff4600]}Parallel Nightmare{c[000000]} still somehow behind\nit? Team Kirby hurried off to his last known\nlocation: {c[ff4600]}Castle Village {c[000000]}and the {c[ff4600]}Grasslands{c[000000]}...
StoryText_16	A thundercloud of poison rose over {c[ff4600]}the\nDunes{c[000000]} on an icy-cold night, leaving Team\nKirby to dodge their way through the\npoisonous rain in this {c[ff4600]}ordeal{c[000000]}!
StoryText_17	The toxic airborne event, {c[ff4600]}Venom Kracko{c[000000]},\nwas defeated by Team Kirby and their bonds\nof courage and friendship.\x0e\0\x04\0They found no traces of {c[ff4600]}Parallel Nightmare\n{c[000000]}in the area, though, so Team Kirby moved\non in search of clues.
StoryText_18	The wizard from another world, {c[ff4600]}Parallel\nNightmare{c[000000]}, had given up on ruling the\nkingdom in favor of exacting revenge\non the heroes of Team Kirby.\x0e\0\x04\0It was time to {c[ff4600]}bring matters to an end\n{c[000000]}in a final battle, and {c[ff4600]}Super Team Kirby\n{c[000000]}was ready to save the world.
StoryText_19	{c[ff4600]}Super Team Kirby{c[000000]} fought as no one ever had\nto restore peace to the Dream Kingdom.\x0e\0\x04\0They ended the uproar in the kingdom that\nhad been instigated by the vile wizard.\x0e\0\x04\0Team Kirby had cornered {c[ff4600]}Parallel Nightmare{c[000000]},\nbut the villain used a dimensional rift to call\nthe {c[ff4600]}ancient hero {c[000000]}called "the most powerful\nin the galaxy."\x0e\0\x04\0Their tears having run dry and feeling near\ndefeat, Team Kirby nonetheless dug deep,\nworked together, and defeated the {c[ff4600]}ancient\nhero{c[000000]} at last.\x0e\0\x04\0And, with that, a beautiful crescent moon\nshining in the night sky, {c[ff4600]}true peace{c[000000]} returned\nto the Dream Kingdom.\x0e\0\x04\0And from that day on, we were free to fluff\nup our pillows and drift off to sleep\nwhenever we wanted...
