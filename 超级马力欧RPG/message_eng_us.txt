Don't let Bowser bruise you, Mario!
Mario! Prepare yourself for the great beyond!
What was that sound?
N...N...NO!
It's a chain reaction! Hang in there,\nChaindelier!
I'm holding on by the skin of your teeth!
Whatever you do, DON'T LET GO!
Eyaaaaa!
Coming, Mario?
Fight, Mario!
FIGHT!
This should finish you!
Mwa ha! Did you think I was just gonna GIVE\nher to ya?
You're ALWAYS in my way!
This is it! I'm gonna take you out, Mario!
Fungah! Foiled again!
Oh, Mario! You had me so worried.
Let's get out of here!
Eeeeek!
Mario! The whole castle's shaking!
Hey, Mario! Lots of people use something called\na door to go in and out of their houses...
Anyway, I came by to pick up Princess Peach,\nsince she's a bit late.
Hey, I thought the princess was here with you,\nMario! So where is she?
Mario, what's with the silent treatment?! You're\nnot telling me something.
It's Bowser again, isn't it? Oh no, here we\ngo again!
Mario, would you please bring her back, like you\nalways do?
If you're tired, just turn off the Fungi Light next\nto your bed for a snooze.
Mario! I forgot something important!
If you get knocked out, you'll wake up at the last\nplace you saved.
But guess what? On this adventure, you'll save\nautomatically whenever you go between areas!
It'll save all the time, so if worse comes to worst,\nyou won't lose too much. Progress, am I right?
You can also hop on this thing to save, just like\nthe good old days.
Use them however you like! They're great for\ntaking a break from your adventure.
That's everything important I can think of. Now\nget yourself to Bowser's Keep!
\PYou found a secret code!\Q
I wonder what it did. Let's check your stats.
Huh! Looks like nothing changed.
Well...maybe it gave you some experience?
Nope, that's still the same too.
I'll level with you. There aren't any other codes.\nAnd this one will do the same thing every time.
Though I'm always happy to hang out with you\nif you want to try it again.
\PThat's all for the secret code!\Q
Halt! Who goes there? A trespasser!
This castle now belongs to us, the Smithy Gang.
We have big plans, and this is the first step in\nthem! If it weren't for nosy characters like you...
we'd practically OWN this world!
\P\NSo let's see you deal with THIS!\Q
THAT'S Bowser's Keep?! It's pretty crumbly\nnow that I see it from here.
The Star Road was broken when that giant\nsword pierced it.
How dare they stick that hunk of junk into my\nbeautiful keep! I won't take this lying down!
I don't want to imagine a world where hopes and\nwishes can't come true.
Until it's repaired, no wishes can come true.\nLet's find the scattered Star Pieces!
I'll get my home back, just you watch. Fall in,\nminions!
We need to hurry and collect the Star Pieces.\nLet's get back at it, everyone!
You're back so soon! Did you forget something?
No? What happened then?
The bridge to Bowser's Keep is out now? Just\nwonderful...
We must inform the chancellor of the Mushroom\nKingdom at once! Let's go, Mario.
Oops, excuse me!
...Oh? That bump on your head reduced your\nHP level.
One of the Mushroom Kingdom's famous items\nought to perk you right up!
\PGot a \!!\Q
Uh, now why did I rush back? I had...something\nto tell you.
Ack, I remember! I came to warn you that\nMushroom Way is swarming with monsters!
I just barely made it back here in one piece!\nMario, please do something.
Perhaps I can help. Do you know about\nAction Commands?
Hey, you better watch out! He knows about\nAction Commands.
He's gonna punch your lights out!
He's got more bark than bite, huh?
Uh, now why did I rush back? I had...something\nto tell you.
That's right! We need to tell the chancellor\nabout Peach!
I'll see you over at the Mushroom Kingdom.
Just in case, take these with you.
\PGot three \!s!\Q
OK, allow me to explain.\O First we'll enter\na battle.
First, push \o.
Hold it!
Now hit \o as the attack hits.
Good timing!
When successful, your damage increases.
Hit \o as enemies attack too!
Good timing!
If your timing is perfect, you'll take no damage.
But Action Commands won't save you from\nattacks that hit your whole party.
Now, try a Special move by pressing \r!
Push \o here!
Good timing!
Depending on the move, sometimes you'll\nhave to do more than just press a button.
So keep an eye out for that!
By the way...
Don't forget it's there, OK?
And there you have it! Now you stand a fighting\nchance against those monsters!
\PFound a \!!\Q
\RNo.\nYes.\S
Whenever you want to use an item to get some\nHP back, press \q.
Eating a Mushroom can give you a boost\nwhenever you're feeling tired!
Press \o with perfect timing, and your attack\nwill damage the surrounding enemies too.
Timing is important in battles! I'll show you\nwhat I mean.
The more successful Action Commands you\ndo, the higher this number will go.
If you can do it two or more times in a row,\nsome buffs will start to kick in!
For you, Mario, the Action Gauge will fill faster\nas power wells up inside.
Each time you nail an Action Command, this\nAction Gauge fills up a little.
When the Action Gauge reaches 100 percent...
then your enemies better watch out! So look\nforward to that.
I know that's a lot to take in, but never fear!
If you press \p during battle and select Help,\nyou can go over any of this again.
You can even see the explanations outside of\nbattle by selecting Help from the menu.
Attacking and Defending
Special Moves
Successful Action Commands
Phew, my life was flashing before my eyes for a\nsecond there. Here's a little something in return.
\PGot a \!!\Q
Boy, that was a close call. Here's a token of\nmy appreciation.
\PGot a \!!\Q
HEY! Are ya lookin' at me? My hammer and I\ndon't like ya!
Mario! You better be careful. He's definitely got\na mean streak!
Now ya got my hammer angry! Ya shouldn't have\ndone that!
Thanks, Mario! I was running so fast I wasn't\nwatching where I was going!
The Mushroom Kingdom's just ahead. We're\nalmost there, Mario.
Hey! Where did this hammer come from?
Hey, do you know what this is?!
It has the Hammer Bro's insignia on it.
No one stands a chance against you when you\nwhomp them with this.
\PYou never know! It might come in handy!\Q
\PPicked up a \!!\Q
Let's get a move on! I'll see you in the\nMushroom Kingdom.
\PIt's a battered old hammer.\Q
\PActually...it's a sturdy hammer,\nbearing the Hammer Bro's insignia.\Q
\PYou never know! It might come in handy!\Q
\PGot the \!!\Q
I haven't seen Princess Peach lately. What?!\nBowser's got her AGAIN?!
Listen, you'd be hiding too if you had a run-in\nwith that crocodile creep.
Mario! Hurry, the chancellor awaits.
Mario! Hurry, the chancellor awaits.
Hey, Mario! Look what you're standin' in!
HA! Gotcha!
Hey! Did you just see a crocodile around here?\nHe talks like a mobster wannabe.
I'm sure he's up to no good! \NHey, wait a sec!\N\nMy wallet's gone!
MY WALLET! \NHas anyone seen my wallet?!
I hope my grandchild turns out to be just like\nthe princess!
Mario! I'd make a great sidekick for you in a few\nyears, right?
Don't worry if Bowser shows up. I know just how\nto get his goat!
A lot of creepy-looking thugs have been\nsneaking into town... Not on my watch!
Mmmph...grmmmph...*chomp*
Hey, Mario! My brother's waiting for you upstairs!
All I do is cook and clean.
One! Two! Three! Think if I practice enough I'll\njump as high as you, Mario?
\PYeah!\Q
Thanks a bunch.
Do you happen to know of a good \nwedding chapel?
Say, hey, Mario! Guess what? Raini isn't just a\nfriend anymore. We're getting married.
It's so nice to see our young ones having a\ngood time!
Mario! What a pleasant surprise! One of the\nFrog Sage's grandchildren is running errands in\ntown today. I haven't seen him though...
Oh, you're here to shop? What are you\nlooking for?

All right, now, let's start again. Go in front of the\ncounter, and talk to me.
You know, I hate to admit it...but I love this job!\nWhat are you looking for?
Hey, what do you think you're doing?! Get off of\nthere this minute!
I order you to stand before me.
I now order you to jump.
I wish you luck in the future.
I now order you to jump.
In this world, there are things called\nHidden Treasures.
Why don't you crash for a while? It'll only cost\nyou three coins!
Ahem...you're a little short!
Good luck, Mario!
Don't talk to me now.
Oh, shut up.
Oh, now look! I lost 'cause of YOU!
It's not like I'm always sleeping.
Mario, there you are! I'll tell the chancellor\nyou're here. \NI'll wait for you down the hallway.
*pant* *pant* Mario...I'm...sorry I'm...late. I was\ncaught up...in some business.
So, shall we head off to the chancellor's\nplace now?
This way, please.
Hey, chill!
Didn't I tell you to chill?!
I'm guarding the treasure room. Sorry, but you'll\nhave to get the chancellor's permission to pass.
The vault guard better not be goofing off while\nI'm cleaning the guest room!
This way, please.
Hey, chill!
Didn't I tell you to chill?!
The princess hasn't returned yet.\N Can you\nimagine how the chancellor must feel?
Let's refrain from searching through other\npeople's things!
\PFound Peach's ???\Q
Hey there! What do you think you're doing?
I'll give you this in exchange. Just leave\neverything where it was!
\PGot a \!!\Q
Sir, Mario has arrived!
This way, please.
This way, please.
This way, please.
This way, please.
Hey, hey! Wrong way.
Hey, hey! Wrong way.
Mario! Thank goodness you're here!
We heard an explosion or something at\nBowser's Keep. It was so loud I almost\ndropped my spores!
Uh...excuse me? Wh...where's the princess?\nShe departed for your house HOURS ago!
I fear the worst! Could Bowser somehow be\nbehind all of this?
Spores alive! You're telling us that Bowser has\nabducted the princess AGAIN?
Never mind. It will be up to you to enter the keep\nand rescue Princess Peach!
Egad! The keep is unassailable?! What awful\npower is at work here?!
Mario...her life is in your hands. Please, save our\ndear princess!
Mario!
Forgive me. \NBut I can't stop worrying about\nthe princess...
Go to the cellar and prepare for your journey.\nThe vault guard shall assist you.
\RSure!\nYeah right, kid.\S
\ROK!\nNo, thanks.\S
Hey, Mario!
You're making sure to equip the things you\nget, right?
Shall I have Toad explain the process?\n\RYes, please!\nAbsolutely no need at all.\S
You will equip things using the menu.\O\nPlease press \v.
First, choose Equip. Confirm with \o.
You can equip these.
\ȈChoose the hammer and press \o!
Then you're set!
Mario!
There, now I feel more at ease.
Ah, that's our Mario for you. You're clearly well-\nequipped for this task!
You can buy armor and accessories in item\nshops. Now then, take care!
\PGot a \!!\Q
Don't forget to equip it if you're hunting for\nHidden Treasures.
Use your awesome jumping ability to look for\n'em. This should help too.
So long, Mario...and good luck!
We know you won't let us down!
Where could the princess be? We're all counting\non you to find her, Mario!
All we can do is wait here. Don't let us down!
On your way now!
Here's the vault. Let me show you around.
I'm standing guard!
Mario!
If you leave now, what will that do to my\nreputation?!
Help yourself to the treasures!
Do you know about Flower Points?\n\RNo! Tell me!\nYes.\S
You sure got your act together, Mario!
Eh-hem...very well. \OFP is consumed during battle\nwhen you use Special moves.
For example... A Jump attack uses three FP. \O\nWhen you Jump, your FP will decrease by three\neach time.
Run out, and you can't use these moves!
An item called a Flower raises your maximum FP.\nRecover FP with Syrup, Mushrooms from chests,\nand at inns.
This is a coin. The small ones are worth one,\nand the large ones are worth 10.
This one's a 10!
This is a Flower.
These Flowers from treasure chests work a little\ndifferently from the Flower items.
Treasure chest Flowers increase your Flower\nPoints (FP) as soon as you grab one. But you\ncan't carry them with you.
Flower Tabs, on the other hand, you can take\nwith you. \OIf you use those from the \q menu,\nthey'll increase your FP.
This is a Mushroom. But you knew that by\nlooking at it, huh?
These Mushrooms you get from treasure chests\ndon't work quite like the Mushroom items.
Treasure chest Mushrooms restore both HP and\nFP when you open the chest. But you can't save\nthem for later.
Mushrooms you find as items only restore your\nHP, but you can take them with you to use\nwhenever you want.
\PCome back here!\Q
\PCome back here!\Q
Oh no! That reptile stole my grandpa's coin!
B...boo-hoo... *sniffle* ...I can't cry.
What am I gonna do?
Big boys don't cry. But it's just not fair!
Waaaaaah!
Mario! The chancellor has filled me in! The vault\nis this way.
Rain or shine, I shall fulfill my duty.
Rain or shine, I shall fulfill my duty.
Dunno what that reptile's up to, but...man, can\nhe jump!
It was that reptile! He's the one who stole my\nwallet! But I let him get away...
Rain or shine, I stand watch. But this is getting\nridiculous!
You'll catch your death of cold! Come on, let's\ndry off.
But I wanna play outside!
It's raining hammer handles and pitchforks out\nthere! What are you looking for?
So I guess Princess Peach really WAS\nkidnapped by Bowser.
Hurry and find the princess! We're getting too\nstressed out!
The princess's room is up ahead. Don't you go\nsnooping through her things though.
The princess's room is up ahead. Were you\ncaught trying to steal something?
Honesty is one of your finest qualities, Mario.
You mustn't lie. I know what you've been up to.
Y-yes? Gee...you're soaking wet, aren't you?
I'm all right now. Sorry... There's nothing like\na good cry!
\ţ\ŤMy grandpa asked me to buy some things for\nhim here. When I walked into town, that croc\nstopped me!
Oh yeah! He took it from me! He stole my coin!\nI chased him, but he's way too fast...
Mario! \Ũ\ũLet's see how you're going to take care\nof Bowser!
Wow! He doesn't stand a chance!
Wow! You're THE Mario? I know all about you!\nYou've got more jump in you than a box of frogs!
I'm Mallow from Tadpole Pond. I'm a frog,\nbut can you believe it? I can't jump.\nEmbarrassing, huh?
\ŵHow about it, Mario? Will you help me catch that\nfilthy thief?
\PThe young frog, Mallow, who\ndoesn't look AT ALL like a frog...\Q
\P\Ƒ\ƒjoins Mario in his quest!\Q
You're sure you won't reconsider? \n\RAll right, I'll help you.\nSorry...\S
Oh, please... Pretty please?
I never thought you'd be so mean, Mario.
You know I can't get my coin back without\nyour help.
Who cares if you can jump? Being mean is\nsoooo uncool!
\RAre you kidding?!\nHow did you know?\S
\RSure thing!\nI'm a little busy.\S
\ROK, OK...\nNO!\S
\RAll right, already!\nNo means NO!\S
But why was I crying? There was SOME reason...\Ţ
Thank you thank you thank you!
So I guess Princess Peach really WAS\nkidnapped by Bowser.
Mario! You can go on inside.
Mario! You can go on inside.
Hey, Mario! Look what you're standin' in!
HA! Gotcha!
I hope my grandchild turns out to be just like\nthe princess!
Mario! I'd make a great sidekick for you in a few\nyears, right?
Don't worry if Bowser shows up. I know just how\nto get his goat!
Hey, Mallow! What kept you? I was starting\nto worry.
Wait until you hear this! You see...
Wait...I've already heard. The old Frog Sage told\nme. He seems to know everything! Hold on.
Listen...
The truth of the matter is, well...um...the coin\nwas stolen.
What?! Well, if that's the case, I guess we can't\ntrade. What a shame, huh?!
Oh, but there's no need to worry!
Mario here will help us out!
'Zat so? Well, if Mario's on your team, you'll have\nthat coin back in a jiffy!
Not so fast! Take this with you. You'll probably\nneed it.
\PGot a \!!\Q
You know, I hate to admit it...but I love this job!\nWhat are you looking for?
Mario! I have something to report, sir.
I saw him! He's here somewhere! He just zoomed\npast me a second ago. Did you see him?
Did he look something...like...this?
Why, yes! Exactly!
He's the one who took my coin! Why didn't you\nstop him?
Because I forgot my bazooka at home! Sheesh.\nGive me a break here.
\PCome back here!\Q
Har, har! Youse mugs'll NEVER catch me!\nA snail could outrun you morons! Later!
Th-th-that's himmm! Hurry, Mario, let's get him!
I'll remain here on the lookout!
Mario, you might want to take this.
\PGot a map!\Q
There are scaaary monsters out there, so you\nought to buy some items and armor at that shop.
There he is! He probably stashed it in that bag.\nLet's nab him!\Ó
Are you trying to tail me? Go on home to mommy\nbefore you get hurt, kid!
You couldn't jump to save your life, kid, so I\nguess this is goodbye!
Oh! You're a persistent pest! But I'm 100 miles\nahead of ya!
Give it up already!\n\KThat treasure box is tempting, but now is not the time.\
Dead end! And they won't give up... I'll just\nhave to hide!
He's gone into hiding.
Let's see if we can sneak up behind him and\ncatch him.
What's this? You fools couldn't chase down\na pumpkin!
Ha! Your eyes are much faster than your feet!
At this rate it'll take ya...100 more years to\ncatch me!
Ha! Your eyes are much faster than your feet!
At this rate it'll take ya...50 more years to\ncatch me!
You AGAIN? This is getting old!
It'll STILL take you...
Enough! Ya got me fair and square.
I'll give you back your coin!
Whoa! \Did ya really believe me? \NI was...LYING!
Gimme back my coin or I'll belt ya again!
Ouuuch!
I'm gonna pay ya back in spades, kid!
Go on! Take back your grubby old coin!
Adios, amigos!
All right! We got it back!
Yeah, we did it! We got Grandpa's coin back.
I can finish my errand now.
Hey, look at this! That Croco guy left a wallet!
\PFound a \!!\Q
I'm going back to the Mushroom Kingdom's\nitem shop.
If you want to join me, we can use the map to go\nto the Mushroom Kingdom together!
Help the people in the castle, and they just might\nhelp you!
Oh, wow!
Hey, Mario! Look what you're standin' in!
HA! Gotcha!
That was too darn close. Thanks for the\nhand, Mario.
Hey! That's the wallet the crocodile swiped from\nme! Can I have it back?
Thank you so much! Here, I'll give you this as\na reward. Go on now, take it.
\PGot a \!!\Q
Why, you're as bad as he is!
Hey, give me back my wallet! \n\RAll right, quit whining.\nNo way, José!\S
That was too darn close. Thanks for the\nhand, Mario.
Thanks, Mario. I'll continue to stand watch, but\nnow everyone seems suspicious!
By the way, look what I found.
\PReceived 10 coins!\Q
I'm shaken but not stirred!
Thanks, Mario!
But what about my son upstairs?
Oops! \NI forgot all about him!
Thanks, Mario! Here's a little token of my\nappreciation!
\PGot a \!!\Q
Look! Scary things! Get rid of them!
Thanks, Mario!
Hope my little brother is OK.
Hope my little brother is OK.
Thanks for saving my brother.
Eek! There are...THINGS in our kitchen. Help!
I'm really worried about my son.
Thank you, Mario!
Really, thank you so much for everything!
Here's a little token of my appreciation!
\PGot a \!!\Q
You're going to grow up to be just like Mario,\nyou hear?
\PYeah!\Q
I'm scared!
Boing, boing, boing! Now this guy can JUMP!
I can still jump the highest!
I found the perfect place for a wedding! \NBut now\nwe're all stuck inside.
Yeah, she's right. I guess we can put it off until\nthings cool down around here.
It's so nice to see our young ones having a\ngood time!
It's scary outside, so let's play indoors, all right?
But I wanna play outside!
Please leave the correct amount of money for\nthe items.\n\-Manager\
Excuse me?!
You want to...what? How can you shop at\na time like this?! Just...take what you want\nand leave some money behind...
I order you to stand before me.
I now order you to jump.
I wish you luck in the future.
I now order you to jump.
In this world, there are things called\nHidden Treasures.
Why don't you crash for a while? It'll only cost\nyou three coins!
Ahem...you're a little short!
Good luck, Mario!
Don't talk to me now.
Oh, shut up.
Oh, now look! I lost 'cause of you!
Was the princess kidnapped by those THINGS\noutside? Are THEY a part of this?
See?! I'm wide awake! Now, I guess it's time for\nme to win big cash!
Now THAT was really scary! Everyone's hiding in\nthe princess's bedroom.
I and some others couldn't escape in time.\nI hope no one got hurt...
I'm too scared to pass by them!
Saved by Mario again! How could I ever thank\nyou enough?!
That vault...guard! I come here to save him,\nand he runs into the next room! Well, so much\nfor him.
Never mind that. Guess what I found! It's a\ngold coin!
A gold coin! And it's all MINE!
Oh, I found this in the cellar. Here, you can\nhave it.
\PGot a \!!\Q
I guard the vault. No one takes our treasure!
NOT SO FAST, PAL!
Look at him! Can't even bounce! Hey, maybe we\ncould bounce on his head!
Trapped again!
Saved by Mario again! How could I ever thank\nyou enough?!
You're in one piece!
Thanks to Mario, of course!
Saved by Mario again! How could I ever thank\nyou enough?!
Oh no! The chancellor's still in the throne room!
What?! That's terrible!
But, with Mario around, we're...safe, right?
There we go, now! Hey, wait... Hang on for a\nsec, OK?
Please take this. The princess would be happy\nto know you have something of hers.
\PGot a \!!\Q
Yeah, you're right. I'm asking for too much.
You may NOT sleep in the princess's bed. Have\nyou no manners?
What are those things out there, anyway?!
Oh no! The chancellor's still in the throne room!
I'm scared!
Good luck, Mario! Give 'em heck!
Where do ya think everyone went?
Well, gang, looks like we have ourselves a\nnew home!
We can bounce around all day long! And there's\nno one here who can stand in our way!
Yahoo! Let's bounce the night away!
NOT SO FAST, PAL!
Look at him! Can't even bounce! Hey, maybe we\ncould bounce on his head!
Listen up, gang! \̜\̝\̞\̟\̠\̡These guys are gonna put\na stop to our party!
Are we happy about this?!
You're asking for it!
Ooh, you're gonna get it!
You picked the wrong people not to bounce\nwith, bub!
How 'bout a fat lip to go with that ugly\nmustache?!
\RSure.\nNo way.\S
\ROK!\nNo, thanks.\S
\RYou bet.\nI wouldn't be so sure.\S
I'm sure he's up to no good! \NHey, wait a sec!\N\nMy wallet's gone!
Hey...you gave it to someone! You're gonna\nget it! You're gonna get it!
I'm sure he's up to no good! \NHey, wait a sec!\N\nMy wallet's gone!
MY WALLET! \NHas anyone seen my wallet?!
You're gonna get it!
This is not good!
This is not good!
The mustachioed one is strong!
Strong, yes!
We must warn the boss!
Come on!
Oh! It's you, Mario. What a relief!
Once again, Mario to the rescue!
But who were those...
Chancellor!
Sir! Thank goodness you're all right!
Mario! So it was you who got us through all of\nthis! We owe much to you...
First the princess and now this! It's just too\nmuch to bear.
Mario!
\ŉHow about we ask my grandpa for help?\Ŋ\nHe knows...everything!
Excuse me, but...who are you?
Oh, hello! My name is Mallow. I'm from\nTadpole Pond...
Well, any friend of Mario's is welcome here in the\nMushroom Kingdom.
As I was saying, Mario, you are our only hope!
Mario! Please! You must rescue the\nprincess, now!
Mario! I'm in your debt too.
Let's head over to Grandpa's place in Tadpole\nPond. He can help!
Wait... Why did I even come to the Mushroom\nKingdom in the first place?
Guess I'll find out soon enough.
\PCould Claymorton, the sword-\nlike monster who crashed into\nthe Mushroom Kingdom...\Q
\Phave anything to do with the Star\nPiece that Mario found? Our heroes\nmove on toward the Kero Sewers...\Q
Mario!
So long, Mario...and good luck!
We know you won't let us down!
Where could the princess be? We're all counting\non you to find her, Mario!
All we can do is wait here. Don't let us down!
On your way now!
Here's the vault. Let me show you around.
I'm standing guard!

If you leave now, what will that do to my\nreputation?!
Help yourself to the treasures!

The princess hasn't returned yet. Can you\nimagine how the chancellor must feel?
It doesn't seem like the princess is THAT far\naway. I can almost feel her presence.
\PFound Peach's ???\Q
Hey there! What do you think you're doing?
I'll give you this in exchange. Just leave\neverything where it was!
\PGot a \!!\Q
Hurry and find the princess! We're getting too\nstressed out!
The princess's room is up ahead. Don't you go\nsnooping through her things though.
The princess's room is up ahead. Were you\ncaught trying to steal something?
\RAre you kidding?!\nHow did you know?\S
Honesty is one of your finest qualities, Mario.
You mustn't lie. I know what you've been up to.
So I guess Princess Peach really WAS\nkidnapped by Bowser.
Trample the monsters! Smash 'em all! It'll do ya\ngood. \NTrust me on this one.
Mario! You can go on inside.
Mario! You can go on inside.
Hey, Mario! Look what you're standin' in!
HA! Gotcha!
Hey! That's the wallet the crocodile swiped from\nme! Can I have it back?
\RSure.\nNo way.\S
Thank you so much! Here, I'll give you this as\na reward. Go on now, take it.
\PGot a \!!\Q
Why, you're as bad as he is!
Hey, give me back my wallet! \n\RAll right, quit whining.\nNo way, José!\S
That was too darn close. Thanks for the\nhand, Mario.
I hope my grandchild turns out to be just like\nthe princess!
Mario! I'd make a great sidekick for you in a few\nyears, right?
Don't worry if Bowser shows up. I know just how\nto get his goat!
Mario! I'd make a great sidekick for you in a few\nyears, right?

\PNyaaaaah!\Q
I'll remain here on the lookout!
I just can't get this meal to look like the picture\nin my cookbook.
Hey, Mario! My brother's waiting for you upstairs!
*chop* *chop* *chop*
One! Two! Three! Think if I practice enough I'll\njump as high as you?
\RSure!\nYeah right, kid.\S
\PYeah!\Q
Thanks a bunch.
We're off to Star Hill to make a wish! Our\nwedding will be held at the village next to the hill.
We'll be gone for a while!\n\Raz & Raini\
\PNyaaaaah!\Q
It's so nice to see our young ones having a\ngood time!
Hey, Mallow! What kept you? I was starting\nto worry.
Hey, mister! I got my coin back!
Oh! Well done, lad! OK, here's the thing\nI promised you.
There! Make sure it doesn't get stolen, eaten,\nor...whatever! Your grandpa needs it, OK?
\PGot a \!!\Q
You bet!
Mario, thank you so much! Grandpa will be\ndelighted!
All right now, let's start again. Go in front of the\ncounter, and talk to me.
You know, I hate to admit it...but I love this job!\nWhat are you looking for?
Hey, what do you think you're doing?! Get off of\nthere this minute!
I order you to stand before me.
I now order you to jump.
I wish you luck in the future.
I now order you to jump.
In this world, there are things called\nHidden Treasures.
Why don't you crash for a while? It'll only cost\nyou three coins!
\ROK!\nNo, thanks.\S
Ahem...you're a little short!
Good luck, Mario!
Oh, \Nwait, \Nwait...
Wait, hold on! This is the highest score...
Oh, now look! I lost 'cause of you!
Gracious!
This is the entrance.
Grandpa says to watch out for Belome, whoever\nthat is! It's probably a little dark down there,\nso keep alert!
\PStand on the pipe, and push \o.\Q
\PRead directions on how to enter?\Q\n\RYes.\nI already know.\S
Stand on the pipe, and push \o.
To reenter a pipe, jump off once, and try again.
\PThe water has been drained.\Q
Th...this must be...Belome! Is that a fire hose or\nhis tongue?!
Moh, \Nho, \Nho! \NAck! It's a snack attack!\nAnd you're it!
You think you've won, huh?
Little did you know...
I'm all that's stopping a flood of water!
So long, soakies!
Belome must have been lying when he said\nwater would come gushing out of here...
Er, Mario...do you hear something? Or is it\njust me?
WATER! Here it comes! We need to switch it\nback before we're washed away!
Mario! Hold on a sec!
I'm not waiting here alone. If you go outside,\nI go outside.
That's a big door. Think there's a switch\nsomewhere?
Wasn't that fun? You got...\" \coins coin coins\!

\PThey won't play with strangers,\nso go and meet the Frog Sage first.\Q
I am the composer, Toadofsky.
I am trying to create my next masterpiece,\nbut I've got composer's block.
You want a music lesson from moi?
\RYes.\nNope!\S
Let's start by reading notes. See the five lines?
Between the second and third lines from the top\nlies Do.
\ÝKeep going up from Do, and the notes are Re\nand Mi. Go down from Do, and you'll get Ti, La,\nSo, and Fa.
You're on your way to composing!
Well, be that way!
So, what do you think?
\RLet's hear it again.\nI want to recompose it.\nNever mind.\S
All right, let's hear it again.
To recompose the song, just jump on\nthe froggies.
Well, be that way!
Hi! Can I help you?
Mallow, it's you!
We've heard all about your adventures with\nSuper Mario. You guys beat up Belome, right?
You know about that?
See, Mario, \Öthe waterways of the world bring\nnews to us here.
That's why Grandpa knows all the news that's fit\nto hear!
Are you really \Ø\ÙTHE Super Mario?
Hey, everybody! You'll never guess who's here!
He's the real thing! But he doesn't look anything\nlike I thought he would.
They DO say he can jump better than a froggie.\nI wonder if it's only a rumor?
Well, well... What's new?
Grandpa! Mario's been helping me!
I know, child. That rainstorm we just had...that\nwas you, wasn't it?
\KOuch!\
\KWatch it up there!\
\KYou're supposed to make me look like I'm floating here, OK?!\
Welcome! So you are Mario, yes? I am the \nFrog Sage.
You have come to seek wisdom from me, have\nyou not? I've been waiting for you!
Yes, old wise people can often give\ngood advice...
But how rude of me! Let's get more comfortable.\nCome along and we'll talk.
\KClear! Full reverse!\
Tadpoles! Don't just float there! Make\nyourselves useful! Form a bridge for Mario.
Welcome to the Frog Coin emporium!
You're a first-timer, aren't you? Listen up. The\ngreen coins you find periodically are Frog Coins.
Accumulate them, and you can buy items at\nTadpole Pond.
Welcome to the Frog Coin emporium!
Welcome to the Juice Bar!
Are you a card member? Even Toadofsky has\na membership here!
Sorry, you're limited to this menu if you don't\nhave a current membership card.
Ah! An Alto Card holder! What would you like?
Hmm. A Tenor Card holder, huh? What'll it be?
Wow, a Soprano Card holder! What can I\nget you?
May I help you?
I've got this dream...of becoming a composer...
I want to be as famous as Toadofsky!
My favorite song?
It's the Frog Sage's suite no. 18.\n♪So La Mi Re Do Re Do Re♪\nToadofsky's fond of it too!
It's the Moleville miners' song.\n♪Mi Do So Do Re La Ti Do♪\nIt's got soul!
It's the song that the Monstro Town star\ndances to.
Oops, I forgot the rest.
I heard your composition, and it's pretty good.
Can't wait to graduate from music school and\nstart composing!
\PPlay notes by jumping on the\ntadpoles. \OLet's hear your melody.\Q
Yes, come into my sanctuary, and partake of my\nwisdom, children.
Let's see...
That Smithy character that appeared at\nBowser's Keep... He is quite formidable, yes?
And, Mario, you wish to rescue the princess\nquickly, do you not?
But oh! If only you knew the truth!
Patience, young one. Let me explain. Here is\nwhat happened...
You were rescuing Peach from Bowser's Keep.
After defeating him, just when you were about to\nfree the princess...
You heard a loud crash \Nand saw a huge sword\nsplit the sky!
Whoosh, out of the blue!
The shock sent the three of you flying.
Bowser and Peach are still lost somewhere out\nthere. Now...
You're worried about the princess, but first you\nneed to take care of Smithy.
His underlings are wreaking havoc in our world!
Claymorton, whom you defeated at the\nMushroom Kingdom, was one of them. More\nwill be coming.
Grandpa, I almost forgot to tell you something!\nWe found a star in the Mushroom Kingdom\ncastle. Do you know why it was there?
A star, eh? Most interesting.
This may sound illogical, but I believe shooting\nstars can grant wishes...
And now more than ever, I believe they will play\na vital role in the fight against Smithy.
Was that too much to absorb? Would you like\na recap?
\RSure.\nNope.\S
OK, here's the gist of it! Smithy invaded our\nworld and took over Bowser's Keep.
Peach and Bowser were thrown by the impact,\nand now Smithy and his cohorts are on\na rampage.
The shooting stars are somehow connected\nto this disturbance, and they're the key to\ndefeating Smithy.
Would you like me to repeat that?\n\RYes.\nNo.\S
It's quite a situation we have on our hands,\nisn't it?
Wow, everything sounds so dire and serious.
\͖\͗I guess Claymorton was only the first of many,\nMario. Some of them'll make Bowser seem NICE.
Mallow, you speak as if these things do not\nconcern you.
You will accompany Mario on his adventure too.
Grandpa! What are you talking about?
I'm only a simple tadpole! This adventure isn't\nfor me!
Mallow, my boy, I've kept this from you until now,\N\nbut you're...\N
\Pnot a tadpole!\Q
\PSay WHAT?!\x\Q
I was sitting here one rainy day, enjoying a snack\nof crickets...
when I happened to see a basket floating down\nfrom the falls.
\ΒI peeked inside and saw a little baby staring\nright back at me! The name "Mallow" was written\non his belt.
I felt sorry for the little bundle of puff and took\nhim in to raise as my own grandchild.
He had powerful magic, \Γand I knew he was more\nthan a piece of fluff.
I thought, "Surely, this child must be from some\nfar-off land."
Grandpa... You mean, I'm not...a tadpole?
*sniffle*... \N*sniffle*... \N*sniffle*...\N
Mallow! Now is not the time to cry!
Go with Mario on his adventure, and find your\nreal family.
Your real mother and father are out there\nsomewhere.
\KPsst, Mario.\
The boy's magic is sure to come in handy on\nyour adventure. You'll take him along, yes?
I won't cry anymore. I'll go on this adventure with\nMario and find my real family!
Then it is settled. You must embark on your\nadventure immediately.
First, go to Rose Town, where they need\nyour help.
Grandpa!
Peach is no longer there!
\PSounds. Laughter. Mirth. Revelry.\nDonuts. Reading. Dolphins. Relax.\Q\n\-A few notes on my latest tune.\
*sniff* It will be quiet around here with Mallow\ngone. Maybe a snack will cheer me up.
*sniff* It will be quiet around here with Mallow\ngone. Maybe a snack will cheer me up.
That's right! I had forgotten all about it.
I will give you something for the Cricket Pie you\nbrought back.
Ah, I know! You shall have the staff I used when\nI was Mallow's age.
The Froggie Stick will come in handy. Do not\nforget to equip it.
Go to Rose Town now. Luck be with you!
Do you not think it rude to stand on my\ndining table?
\PThe yellow tiles automatically carry\nyou when you hop on them. You\ncan't jump off a tile when it's blue.\Q
All right, people! Form ranks!
Jagger, head of the shelled warriors!
Wizakoopa, master of the hooded sorcerers!
And last but not least, Goomhilde, grande dame\nof the groundling Goombas!
This is our finest moment! Bowser's Minions are\ninvincible! We shall be victorious!
\ǵThe bridge is down, but we'll find a way to get\nback in! Move out, on the double!
Bowser and his minions must be on their way to\nBowser's Keep.
\ǶCome on! Rose Town is just up ahead.
See, arrows come flying out from the forest...\nand when you're hit, you can't move! See, look!
I can't move a muscle. Now I know how a\nscarecrow feels!
I tell you, it's scary out here, but someone's got\nto pump the water.
I wanna go someplace fun! Standing around\nhere is sooo boooring!
I... I can't move!
Oh, this is not good... Now I can't go to the\nforest to chop up any wood.
I can't do a lot right now, so let me ask you this:\nHave you seen the mushrooms in the forest?
\RSure have!\nNope. Never.\S
Oh, just curious...
There are two kinds of mushrooms. One\nterrorizes people, and the other helps people.\nAvoid the former.
There's a stairway that leads to my house, but\nmy son's been playing with the controls again!
Mario, only you could jump up there! Please...\nhelp me get back up to my house!
Found me, huh? What are you doing walking\naround here though? You must be pretty bored.
Since the day a shooting star fell into the forest,\narrows have been showering our town!
I... I can't move!
We're told not to go outside 'cause it's too\ndangerous.
Grandpa's pumping some water for us. I wish\nwe could help too...
I'm worried about my grandson. He went out to\nplay but didn't come back when he should have.
I tell you, it's scary out there, but someone's got\nto pump the water.
Mario! Good to have a customer at last. What do\nyou need?
Hello, Mario. It's so nice of you to drop by the\nshop. What can I do for you?
My husband still hasn't come back! I wonder\nwhat's keeping him?
What's taking Daddy so long? Do you think he's\nstill looking for the treasure?
Thanks a million, Mario! Say...were my\ntreasures OK?
\RThey sure were.\nI wouldn't say so...\S
Oh! That's great news! What a relief! Since we\ndidn't get hit by any arrows, I'll tell you a secret.
Enter the forest. When you hit an area with four\npaths, go left, left, straight, right—in that order.
You'll surely find something nice.
You already found 'em, huh? That's fantastic!\nHere, why don't you take this along with you?
\PGot a Frog Coin!\Q
Oh! That's great news! What a relief!
You're kidding!
They're just fine.
Oh, well... Since we didn't get hit by any arrows,\nI'll tell you a secret.
You're kidding!
WHAT?! They're gone?! Mario, you're the only\none who can reach them!
\RSorry, I got carried away.\nI don't know anything.\S
All right, I'll take your word.
Button? Yeah, I jumped on it. I do it all the time.\nIt really winds my dad up!

Boing, boing...
Guwa ha! You think you can hurt me with your\nchildish pranks?!
Attention, Peach! You're comin' with me!\nZip your lip!
HELP! HAAALP! Somebody, please help me!
HAAAAL...\N
Oh my gosh!
It's... \NM... \NMa...\<
\ăMom! Mom, look, we have a...guest!
Yes, dear, I hear you... Hello th...ere... Why...\naren't you Mario?!
For real?!
Well, you have the hat...and the funky 'stache.\nAre you really Mario?!
\RYou betcha!\nWrong number!\S
How do I know it's you? You might just be pulling\nmy leg! Show me! Prove it!
All right! Hey, Mario, wanna play with me?\nI'm playing "save the world"!
Now, Gaz! Mario might be a little tired, dear.
Awwww, come on, Mom! YOU never play with\nme! It's no fun playing alone.
Oh dear. Mario, I hate to ask, but... Could you\nplay with Gaz for a little while?
YES! "Mario" just bought the farm, so um...you\ncan be Bowser...
I'll be Geno, OK?
Ready? Let's play from where I left off!
Ooh, scary! But just watch ME!
Better watch out, Bowser, 'cause Geno's gonna\nblow you away! Take this!
Your turn, Bowser!
Owwww... Oh no, if he keeps this up, I'm\nfinished! All right, you asked for it!
\ŊThe super-duper...\Ocustom, patented, one and\nonly...\NSHOOTING STAR \NSHOT!
Oops. I...uh...I think I...missed.
Oh dear, oh my! Mario, are you all right?
Awwww, you're a fake. Well, you'll have to do.\nLet's play my..."Geno" game!
Mom! You'll never believe what I just saw...
It was amazing, Mom!
Yes, dear. That's nice, dear. Isn't Geno the one\nwho broke my lamp the other day?
Awww, Mom, that was just, well, you know...\nNow this was real!
I swear, Mom, really! It's true! I saw him outside!
All right, Gaz, let's hear it! What are you trying\nto get out of this time, hmmm?
Mom, I didn't DO anything. I really, truly saw\nGeno walking into the forest!
S...\Nsorry if I hurt you!
But...what would Geno want in the forest?
Sorry I knocked you down a while ago. Geno...\ndoesn't know his own strength!
Oh! This boy is IMPOSSIBLE!
Hi, Mario. Staying for a nap? \n\RSure!\nMaybe next time.\S
Don't worry. It's on the house. I mean, you were\nso kind to Gaz.
Stop by anytime now, you hear?
Mario! I hate to bother you while you're resting,\nbut I wanted to deliver this to you.
\PGot a \!!\Q
Well, good luck!
I just saw Geno walk into the forest! Neat, huh?
You know what's really weird? I just saw a\ndoll dressed in a blue cape walking toward\nthe forest.
You know what's really weird? I just saw a\ndoll dressed in a blue cape walking toward\nthe forest.
A...walking doll? Yeah, sure, pal! I think you need\nsome help. Now scram!
SUPER JUMP ATTACK!
Nine hundred ninety-seven! Nine hundred\nninety-eight! Nine hundred ninety-nine! One\nthousand! Nya ha ha! One thousand arrows!
For cover they run, nya! Fun this is, yes. Nya!\nAnother one thousand will I shoot!
Mario, who is that guy? \NHe must be the one\nshooting arrows at Rose Town!
Happy I am, nya! Look...LOOK at their\nexpressions when freeze they do!
Woo-hoo! They're standing like statues!
Nya! More practice do I need!
Oh no! He's not stopping! We've got to do\nsomething!
Who do you think you are? You can't just go in\nthere with your fists flying!
There're too many of 'em. We'll be creamed!
Oh no, someone's coming! Let's hide and see if\nwe can learn anything.
Look what I found, Bowyer!
What? WHAT? Disturb me you must not!\nPracticing, I am.
More arrows must I shoot! More statues must\nI make, nya!
Stop!
Hold it right there! You don't know what you're\ndoing. Return that star to me!
Gnya, NYA!? A stranger you are...and strange\nlooking at that!
Teach you, we must, who's in charge!
Who might you be? Nya?!
I serve...
a higher authority.
That Star Piece belongs to everyone.\nYou can't keep it.
Nya! NYA! Angry I am!
Nya!
A lesson I will teach you!
Hey! Chill out!
Mario! It's dangerous out there!
You're gonna help, huh?
Whack that weirdo... Save the guy in blue...
Me too!
I will do what I can!
But...from over here!
I'm NOT afraid.
And I'm NOT gonna cry!
Yeouch!
Stop it! That's enough.
Gunya! Nya!
Strong you are.
But stronger am I! Hurt you, I will!
So long, nya! Part now, we must!
Nya nya NYA!
Thanks for the help!
But...who are you?
Mario! You just...DITCHED me back there!
Huh? Don't I know you? You look...familiar.
So! You're THE Mario!
We know about you!
Knock knock! Nya!
Insulted, I am!
Thanks for the help. You really got me out of\na jam.
\ɚWhy are you staring at me? You know I'm more\nthan just a doll, don't you?
Have you guessed the truth? I'm a visitor from\nabove, and this is a form I'm borrowing briefly.
You mean, like, from the sky or something?
Higher than that, I'm afraid! Do you two know\nanything about the Star Road?
Completely in the dark, eh? Well, it's a big mess\nup there right now, and it concerns you too!
Let me explain...
\ɛYou've heard of wishing upon a shooting star?
At the Star Road, your wish is transformed into\na star.
When it's granted, it then turns into a shooting\nstar and falls down to earth.
\ɜSo you see, the Star Road plays an integral role\nin granting wishes.
But...
\ɝEver since a sword destroyed the Star Road,\neverything's come to a halt.
No stars have been made since.
\ɞThe way things stand, yours is a world where\nwishes can't come true anymore.
Are you saying THIS star is a part of your\n"Starway"?
That's Star Road, my fluffy little friend...
Yes, \Nthat star is a broken piece of the Star Road.
I'm here to find them all and repair the\nStar Road.
The broken Star Pieces... There are seven\naltogether.
For peace to return...
we must get rid of Smithy, find the Star Pieces,\nand repair the Star Road.
I'm ♡♪！？, but that's hard to pronounce, so...
Call me Geno, after the doll.
I chose him because he looked the strongest\nout of all the dolls.
Now grab the star, Mario!
Come on! Let's get this show on the road.
\PGeno, who is searching for\nthe pieces of the Star Road,\njoins Mario and Mallow.\Q
\PThings are definitely looking up!\Q
Ooh, \NI heard everything! \NWho would have known\nthat star was so important?
I've got to inform Smithy!
\PThe secret to the shooting stars has\nbeen unraveled. Find the Star Pieces,\nand bring peace back to Mario's world.\Q
\PBad luck!\Q
Now I can finally move. Maybe I'll go pick\nmushrooms in the forest.
It's a little scary, but I'll take my chances.
I'm so proud of my grandsons. Just look at them.
I'm happy I can make things easier on\npoor Gramps.
Phew... That was close, but I made it on time...
Hey, I'll carry that!
Things are finally back to normal. Thank\nyou, Mario.
Good, now I can finally go to the forest to chop\nsome wood.
There's a stairway that leads to my house, but\nmy son's been playing with the controls again!
Mario, only you could jump up there! Please...\nhelp me get back up to my house!
Oh, I see you're back again. Have you been to\nYo'ster Isle?
\RYou betcha.\nNope, not yet.\S
Oh, I see... So you've tried your luck with the\nGoomba-thumping game, huh?
You have to go through the pipes to get there!
I can finally move!
I guess I owe it all to Mario... What an\namazing guy!
\PFound a \!!\Q
My grandson has come back home in one piece.\nThank you, Mario!
I'm so proud of my grandsons. Just look at them.
I'm happy I can make things easier on\npoor Gramps.

Hi, Mario! Bet you're gonna be pretty busy from\nhere on. What can I get you?
Hello, Mario. It's so nice of you to drop by the\nshop. What can I do for you?
I thought I heard a big boom over from the\nmountains. Hmmm, guess I'm starting to\nhear things...
Can't believe an arrow hit him...
I'm finally home!
What's taking Daddy so long? Do you think he's\nstill looking for the treasure?
Thanks a million, Mario! Say...were my\ntreasures OK?

You'll surely find something nice.
WHAT?! They're gone?! Mario, you're the only\none who can reach them!
\RSorry, I got carried away.\nI don't know anything.\S
Oh, well... Since we didn't get hit by any arrows,\nI'll tell you a secret.
All right, I'll take your word.
Excuse me—I didn't hear you...\n\RI'm so sorry.\nI said I don't know.\S
You've found the treasure! Way to go! Keep up\nthe good work!
Geno! You came back!
See, Mom? This is the Geno I was talking about!
My, my, what a fabulous costume! It must be\nkind of hot for the person wearing it though.
Awww, forget it, Mom.
All right, Geno, let's play!
How I wish I could!
But Mario and I must leave now to find the\nmissing Star Pieces.
Star Pieces? You mean like shooting stars?\nWhat for?
Well... How can I explain this...
Well, Gaz...it's like this...
This is how it used to be, but now it's like...
Uh-uh...nope! You lost me.
Well, let's just say that if things stay the way\nthey are, your wishes will never come true.
What?! So you mean even if I grow up, I won't\never be strong and cool like you?!
No one's wishes will come true until the Star\nPieces are found and the Star Road repaired.
Which is why I have chosen to join these two in\norder to find the missing Star Pieces.
So that's it! Well, Mario needs all the help he\ncan get!
I'll be rooting for you! Please, go fix the Star\nRoad, and make sure all my dreams come true!
That's a promise!
Cool!
Oh, wait! Wait a minute!
This is yours, Geno, so take it along with you.
\PGot a \!!\Q
Thanks for being a good sport, Gaz. I'll see you\nwhen I get back.
Go get 'em, Geno! You're the main man!
It's gonna be a little lonely without you, but...\nhey, I can handle it.
It was indeed a Star Piece. But our journey to\ncollect them all isn't over. Can you wait just a\nlittle while longer for me to return?
Mario! How are we feeling? \n\RLike a new man!\nNeed coffee. Keep away.\S
Well, that's good to hear. Thank you so much for\nspending time with Gaz. He just loved it!
Yes, you look awful! Why don't you rest\nsome more?
Hi, Mario. Staying for a nap? \n\RSure!\nMaybe next time.\S
Don't worry. It's on the house. I mean, you were\nso kind to Gaz.
Stop by anytime now, you hear?
Hi, I'm the gardener. See that huge planter?
I've spent many years seeking the legendary\nseed and fertilizer to fill it with but had no luck.
*sigh* If I could only find them!
Ooh, incredible! I do believe that's the legendary\\nfast-growing seed. I'll never forget the day 50\\nyears ago, when I happened to come across\
a book about an enormous plant. It seized my\\nimagination and changed my life. I was but a\\nyouth that day when I swore beneath the stars\
that one day I would make that plant my own.\\nI traveled all over in search of it, scoured\\nlibraries for information, and poured my heart\
into the idea, but without the seed itself, none of\\nit was any use. Which is all to say, that seed you\\nhold is crucial to fulfilling my lifelong dream\
as a gardener. That's why it's of the utmost\\nimportance to me—why I must insist, despite\\nany protest you may have—that you hand it over.\
Really!\
Hey! I haven't finished yet.
Short attention span?
Well, that's my story. Say...will you give me\nthat seed?
You changed your mind?
\RYes.\nNo.\S
I finally have it!
This is extraordinary!
I...I can't believe it! That's the quick-acting\\nfertilizer I've been seeking forever! I thought it\\nwas merely a rumor among the Beezos. I've\
searched high and low the world over for it, but I\\nnever came close to finding it. Although three\\nyears ago, I explored a cave in Booster Pass\
and made contact with the Beezo clan in Bean\\nValley, but both times, my hopes for the fertilizer\\nwere dashed. So I changed tactics, thinking that\
I could instead formulate it myself, but that route\\nseemed to be impossible. It's no exaggeration to\\nsay that I need that fertilizer you hold in order to\
fulfill my lifelong dream as a gardener. I really\\ncannot stress enough the paramount importance\\nof you handing it over to me without delay.\
Really!\
Hey! I haven't finished yet.
Short attention span?
Yes, you might say I have fertilizer on the brain.\nWill you give it to me?
May I have the fertilizer?\n\RYes.\nNo.\S
Well, Mario? Will you give me the fertilizer?
\RYes.\nNo.\S
I finally have it!
But without the seed, it's useless.
I'd be so happy if I only had the seed!
I'm sooo disappointed.
Oh, thank you! I finally have both the seed and\nthe fertilizer.
I'll try them out right away.
I'll plant the seed...
Then give it fertilizer.
...Nothing's happening.
But without the "Seed",\nit's useless.
W...\Nwow!
This is amazing!
I'll try them out right away.
Finally...my long-held dream has become reality.\\nIf I were to attempt to describe my feelings right\\nnow, it would be like winning the lottery when\
the odds were a million to one against you. No,\\nthat's not quite it. It's nothing so mundane. It's a\\nmore refined joy, of course, but alas, what I'm\
discovering is that mere words do not suffice to\\nconvey the extent of the emotions I'm feeling.\\nIn fact, I've lost track of what I'm saying, and I'm\
exceedingly close to certain that the truth of it\\nis that no one would be able to suppress this\\noverwhelming torrent of emotion. When I first\
came into possession of this planter, it was not\\neasy to believe that a plant big enough to suit it\\ncould even exist. And yet now that I see this\
magnificent plant with my own eyes, I am once\\nagain reminded of just how truly incredible\\nnature can be! Is any of this getting through?!\
*sigh* It's good to be a gardener. Wait until my\\nbuddies over at Happy Gardener Monthly hear\\nabout this! They'll be positively green with envy!\
You think it could use a little more fertilizer?\
Oops. Maybe not, huh?
Gals don't care for tightwads, you know!
*sigh* Whatever happened to granting an old\nman's wishes?
This will get me in Happy Gardener Monthly\nmagazine!
THIS! Do you get it?
You know what? I did see something sparkly fall\nsomewhere around Moleville.
Y'think that's one of those things you're looking\nfor, Geno?
That seems highly probable. We'll make Moleville\nour next stop. Thank you for telling us about it.
\ñMommy!
Hey, mate, step right up! Ten coins to do some\nGoomba thumping. How about it?
\RSure, why not?\nI'll save it for another day.\S
Hey, if you're out of cash, better learn to stash.
Then scram!
You can do better than that!
(Boshi only races one-on-one, so everyone\ncan't join us. Too bad!)
(Hey, Yoshi! Think you can beat the old\nBoshi today?)
\ROf course!\nNo, not today.\S
(Here, take my Cookies. Good luck! I'm rooting\nfor you!)
(Thanks! I've got MAJOR support on my side,\nso I can probably win today!)
\PYoshi got some Cookies!\Q
(Yeah, maybe another day. So you've heard,\nright? I'm just waiting for the day we can all\nrace together.)
(Hey, Yoshi! Think you can beat the old\nBoshi today?)
\ROf course!\nNo, not today.\S
(Good luck!)
(It would be so much better if we could all\nrace together!)
There's nothing inside.
(There's nothing in here.)
(What're YOU lookin' at? If you wanna challenge\nme, you have to bring Cookies!)
(So! You brought the Cookies. All right!\nConsider yourself lucky today.)
(You've got yourself a race... One-on-one!)
Hello again! Get ready—the Mushroom Derby is\ncoming up. Want instructions?
\RSure!\nNo, thanks.\S
Press \o and \p alternately along with the\nrhythm. The tighter the rhythm, the faster\nyou go!
Press \r during a race to eat a Cookie. Its\nenergy will help you go faster!
Want instructions again? \n\RYeah, help me out.\nNo, thanks. I'm fine.\S
Keep alternating between \o and \p in time with\nthe beat! Let's practice!
One!\Z Two!\Z
One! \-Two! \-One,\N two,\N three!\N
One!
Two!
There you go! That's the way!
Now, shall we go to the race?
You still have some problems. Come on!\nConcentrate!
\RI'll practice some more.\nRACE TIME!\S
You're not getting it right at all. Are you sure you\nwant to do this?
\RI'll practice again.\nRace time!\S
(This is as easy as it gets, man.)
(Come back when you're serious! Now, I think\nthose Cookies there belong to ME!)
(Looks like I need a little more practice.\nOh well... Let's try it again sometime.)
(Wow! Unbelievable! You just beat BOSHI!)
(Starting today, Yoshi's the new boss\naround here!)
(Since when have you been able to sprint\nlike that?!)
(Oh well... I had my day in the sun. Let me give\nyou a tip! Race someone SLOW.)
(That way, you'll be able to stash away\nthe Cookies!)
(But we don't need a boss!)
(Anyway, I just want to race!)
(Come on, Boshi! Let's see what you're\nmade of!)
(Hmmm... All right! Just stay outta my way!\nOh, here's the Cookie stash for the winner.)
(Thanks to you, Mario, I finally beat that rascal!)
(And we can all race together now!)
(Here's something to remember me by!)
\PGot some \!s!\Q
(You're carrying a lot of things! I'll store \)\nfor you. Don't worry—I won't eat any. That makes\na total of \G.)
(Next time you're in trouble during battle, use\none of these to give me a call.)
(Mario! Glad you finally made it to Yo'ster Isle,\nhome of the Mushroom Derby!)
(Say...now that you're here, we could use\nyour help.)
(Please talk to a few of my pals here, and...)
(What? You can't understand them? Well...hop\naboard, and I'll be your interpreter!)
(Come on, hop aboard!)
(Saddle up?)\n\RSure!\nNo, thanks.\S
(OK then, hop on!)
(All right, see ya...)
There is a letter inside. Care to read it?
\RSure!\nNope.\S
Honeymoon reservations for two!\n\-Mushroom Travel Agency\
There's nothing inside.
(Hey! There's a letter in here, but I can't\nread it...)
(There's nothing in here.)
(Boshi here is the fastest runner...but he's full\nof himself!)
(What? Are you cracked? Racing's my life!\nI could run all day!)
Hello, Mario! Raz here can't even hop on Yoshi!\nBut that's OK. I still love him.
Mario! I'm having the time of my life! Just got\nmarried...stayed in the suite...
Oh, life is just great!
By the way, do you know of a place called...\nGrate Guy Casino? It's supposed to be around\nsomewhere. Have you been?
Oh, you have the card!
Looks like you can use it to play games at a\nplace near Bean Valley. Who knows?!
Maybe I'll see you there, huh? It might be fun!
Hey! How did you DO that?! You'll have to teach\nme someday!
\PFound a \!!\Q
(By the way, you know what I saw not too long\nago? A star, falling somewhere by Moleville!)
(Careful, don't step on the eggs.)
(Wait a sec... You don't have any Cookies.)
(Well, since Yoshi got everyone to race again,\nI'll give you mine as a reward. Here, take 'em!)
\PGot 3 Cookies!\Q
(Now no one has to be left out of a race!)
(Look how he eats! He's gonna be a giant\nsomeday!)
(That can't happen twice!)
There's nothing inside.
(There's nothing in here.)
(You lookin' at me?)\n\RYeah! Let's race.\nUh, no...\S
(Nice weather, eh?)
(Let's race again sometime, all right?)
(Saddle up?)\n\RSure!\nNo, thanks.\S
(OK then, hop on!)
(All right, see ya...)
(Come on, hop aboard!)
(It's the best when we can all race together!)
(What? Are you cracked? Racing's my life!\nI could run all day!)
(Looks like he wants some Cookies. Wanna give\nhim some?)
\RSure!\nNo, let's not.\S
(How many should we give him?)\b
(I'm dying for some Cookies.)
Want to give him some?\n\RSure!\nNo way.\S
How many?\b
(Phew! Now that's what I call generous!)
(Oh! \NI am STUFFED! \NI won't need to eat\nfor weeks.)
\PGot \!!\Q
\PGot a Frog Coin!\Q
(No Cookies, NO RACE.)
It's 10 coins for a night. You need more coinage!
It's 10 coins for a night. Y'all staying the night?
\RYes.\nNo.\S
Dyna went to the mountain with little Mite.
But a star crashed into the mountain, and now\nthey be trapped!
My ma and pa are helpin' out on the mountain.
A pretty star crashed down into the mountain.
I wanted to see it, but my ma told me it was\ntoo dangerous.
Ma said she'd go and find out what's happening,\nbut she's sure takin' her sweet time.
C'mon in. Don't be shy!
Everyone's up on the mountain, but I'm stuck\nmindin' the store.
So, whatcha need?
It's an emergency! Dyna's trapped in the mines!
Bowser, most of our allies have run off! What will\nwe do?
We've only had experience fighting Mario. These\nnew guys are too much!
Shut up, all of you!
I'm the biggest, baddest brute around, and don't\nyou forget it.
But if Mario hears that I've been kicked out of\nmy own castle...
my reputation will be ruined!
Even I have an image to keep up, you know!
Let's show 'em who's the boss around here.
The men folk are doin' their best from the inside.\nI'm diggin' in from the outside...
We got to help 'em folks out.
I knew it was bad news when that star fell on\nthe mountain.
Sure enough, it's causin' trouble!
A star dropped into the mountain and trapped\nsome kids inside.
To make things worse, one of the men folk be\nstuck inside too.
Please, Mario, you gotta help us!
What's happening up there? Is she still working\nup a sweat?
Yeah, and so are the men. Everyone's diggin'\nand diggin'...
I can't keep up with 'em.
I wonder how those kids're doing? Sure wish\nthey'd hurry home!
Oh dear! I sure hope the kids are OK.
I know how you're feelin', but mopin' round here\nain't gonna help a thing!
I know what I said, but I don't think I'd be feelin'\nany different if I was her!
We're gettin' nowhere fast! We'll never reach the\nkids at this rate!
See that up there? That's the old entrance to\nthe mines.
But we can't reach it anymore!
If only that fellow...uh...Mario were here! He\ncould reach that in a heartbeat!
Wha?! Well, speak o' the devil!
Well, I'll be a Goomba's uncle! If it ain't him, in\nthe flesh! Mario, you're a lifesaver!
Mario, have you heard the news?\n\RSure have!\nNews? What news?\S
Mario, will you help rescue them?\n\ROf course!\nNo.\S
Thanks, Mario! Well, there's the entrance\nup there!
Here, hop up on our shoulders!
Well, Dyna took her li'l brother into the mines so\nthey could play.
And then, a huge star crashed into the\nmountain, causing a big cave-in! Now they're\ntrapped inside.
And now, their daddy, who went lookin' for 'em,\nis trapped too!
Don't flake out on us, Mario! Please, we're\nbeggin' ya.
Here, hop up on our shoulders!
Here, hop up on our shoulders!
Hey! Have you heard? There's rare items hidden\nin the mines!
If I find any, I'm gonna sell 'em to someone in\ntown! I'm in it for the money!
Mario! You've come to help us out? One\nproblem though. This is a dead end...
We'd need a bomb to blast through here. Think\nyou could find one?
We really need to find a bomb! I looked,\nbut they're all missing from the storeroom.\nYou think someone stole 'em?
Coins...beautiful COINS! Grab the coins!
Listen up! Let's leave dis half-wit Mario here and\nsplit! Anyone got a beef wit' that?!
Mario! Croco got us again!
Hoo boy! Looks like a dead end here. But not\nto worry...
Heh, heh...I've got a bomb! Never leave home\nwithout 'em.
He took our coins too. Let's chase him down\nand get them back!
*sob*...*sob*... Just you wait... We'll getcha for\nthis! Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,\nbut someday...
\PHe didn't have the coins on him,\nbut he dropped a \!!\Q
*sob*...*sob*... Just you wait... We'll getcha for\nthis! Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,\nbut someday...

Yeouch! Enough already!
Here's your junk.
I'm outta here!
\PGot the coins back! AND...\npicked up a \! too!\Q
You found a bomb! Now we'll bust through in\nno time!
All righty! Stand back!
Let's follow the tracks to the end.
What? The star? It's probably in the back.\nLet's mosey along now.
Oh...guess you're right. I'd just be a burden on\nyou fellas. Well then, I'm countin' on ya to find\nthe kids, hear?
Well, thanks a lot, Mario! Guess I'll be goin' back\nto tell Ma 'bout everythin'.
I just can't go any further. Please...go find Dyna\nand little Mite!
Good day. The name's Punchinello, bomb\nmaker extraordinaire!
Punchinello? Never heard of ya.
They say I'm a hothead, but I'll show them!
You... YOU will make me famous!
So long!
Not bad. Not bad!
Now let's level things up!
Grrrrr...
All right! YOU ASKED FOR IT!
Arghhh!
I must be dreaming! I'm ruined!
I didn't want to do this, but now, I have\nno choice!
I think he's bluffing.
Simmer down, fluffy!
I'm not gonna waste this on YOU.
Who knows what might happen!
Take your best shot!
Enough! I've got my pride.
Now you're in for it!
Huh? What the hay? Why isn't it working?
Argh!
Mario!
If this thing explodes, we're history!
This is a fine mess!
Let's scram! Now!
Eeep!
It's gonna blow!
NO!
What on earth...\ĬWAS THAT?!
Well, we won the battle. \İNow I hope we don't\nlose the war.
Where are Dyna, Mite, and the star?
I guess that part of it's been answered...
Come on, Mario—hurry!
Come on. We still have to find Dyna and Mite.
Seems like you found something mighty useful!\nMy kids, Dyna and Mite, are trapped back there.
Let's blast through and find 'em!
Gwo ho! Thanks, Mario!

Mario, you're our only hope for those kids.\nWe're countin' on ya.
I wonder how those kids're doing? Sure wish\nthey'd hurry home!
Hold your horses, Ma.
I asked Mario to help us out, so I reckon he'll\nbring 'em back when he's good 'n' ready!
I just have this odd feeling that they'll be\ndropping in on us any minute now...
They still gotta use the door like everyone else,\nMa. Now settle down!
We're home!
Gracious! They really did drop in on us!
Oh, my poor babies! Are you OK?
Little Mite, are you hurt?!
Nah, we're OK, Ma. Isn't that right, Mite?\nWe had fun!
Ma-ma! Pa-pa!
He's been knocked senseless! You poor baby,\nyou're safe now.
Dyna! Haven't I told you often enough to never\ngo into the mines by yourself?!
That's enough, Ma. Just be happy to have\n'em back!
We haven't thanked Mario proper either.
I'm so embarrassed! Mario, we can't thank you\nenough for everythin'.
What's that? The roof, you say? Nah, that don't\nmatter none, right, Pa?
It ain't nothing at all! You just leave any repairs\nto me.
Give me a holler if you ever need a hand with\nyour place!
Thanks again for bringing our babies back to us.
\PYou've found Dyna, Mite,\nand a Star Piece...\nBut where is Peach?\Q
If you need anything, don't be no stranger now.
I'll be heading back to the mountain after fixin'\nthe roof, but you come back and see us again,\nyou hear?
That trolley ride was fun! Can we go again?
I reckon Dyna's taken a liking to you, Mario.
Come back, Mr. Beetle! Don't you want to come\nto Booster's and play?
Yeah, don't run away! We just want to play!\nWe'll take good care of you...
Uh...like...what they said, OK, Mr. Beetle?
Don't you dare touch that beetle! It's a present\nfor Booster.
That's right! Just hand it over nice and easy.
Uh... Yeah... Like they said... Or we won't be\nyour friend.
Booster really, really, REALLY likes beetles!\nBut he can't catch his own.
That's right. He's busy keeping the princess\nfrom the sky entertained.
So we're catching beetles for him.
So hand it over!
That's right!
Uh... Pretty please?
Oh no! It's getting away!
Quick, catch it!
CATCH IT!
You know Booster?
He's the weirdo livin' in the tower a little way\nfrom here.
Have you seen the huge hole in the cliff at\nBooster Pass? Strange, huh?
\P"Mi," a name I call myself!\Q

I'm just bored. But if you go to the mountain,\nthey'll sing you the real song.
The record at Moleville Mountain stands at\n\,. Come back and ride\nit again.
When you're tired, just go to the inn and rest.
This hole my wife dug is a shortcut to the trolley!
It's an amusement ride, and I named it Moleville\nMountain! Ain't that nifty?
Drop in here, and you'll be right at the trolley\ntracks. It'll only cost ya 10 coins.
Oh shucks, you ain't got the coins! Well, that's\ntoo bad.
The high score's...um, oh yeah, \n\,. So you wanna ride it\nor what?
\RYes!\nNope.\S
A ticket only costs ya 10 coins, or you can\nwager 30 coins. So what'll it be?
\RPay 10 coins\nWager 30 coins\nListen to an explanation\S
Right. I got your 10 coins. You just hop right in\nthat hole.
Right. I got your 30 coins. You just hop right in\nthat hole.

So what'll it be?
\RPay 10 coins\nWager 30 coins\nListen to an explanation\S
Be that way.
You paid already, so you can go in.
Hey, whatcha trying to pull, huh? You gotta pay\nme first, or you can't ride the trolley.
You heard? There's a rumor that Booster's new\ngirlfriend fell from the sky.
She's supposed to be purty too, just like\na princess.
Now, who would have thought a girl could fall\nout of the sky? Maybe it's Princess Peach?!
Nah...
I heard you're on a quest for the stars that have\nbeen raining down. Good luck to ya!
I knew everything was going to be all right when\nyou showed up.
Thank goodness those kids're safe. Good luck\nfindin' that princess o' yours soon too.

Ma's off gossipin' again! She's been gone\nfor hours.
You like fireworks? I'm working on my very own\ninvention right now.
I've only got the sparklers down, but I ain't\ngiving up!
Wanna buy one for 500 coins?
\ROK!\nNo, thanks.\S
Aw, that's too bad! Come back with more coins.

Check back with me occasionally. You may find\nsomething you like!
C'mon in—you're the talk of the town. They say\nthat you saved the kids.
So, whatcha need?
You can't get inside Booster's Tower very easily.\nYou'll need a REALLY strong person for that.
You're a hero, Mario! If it weren't for you, Dyna\nwould still be inside that mountain!
What a nice Shiny Stone. I'll trade you my\nCarbo Cookie!
\ROK!\nNo, thanks.\S
Gracious, what a deal! Well, here you go.
\PGot a \!!\Q
You're such a scrooge!

Pa fixed it up, and now he's back to work at\nthe mountain.
He's singin' Moleville Blues and putting in\na hard day's work.
I reckon Dyna's taken a liking to you, Mario.
We'll take care of the trolley, so don't bother\nwith it.
Item number three: a Feather. Just fell right out\nfrom the sky all of the sudden! I may have picked\nit up off the ground, but it's a real gem.
Anyway, it's 250 coins.\n\RI'll buy it!\nDon't need it.\S
Golly! You're that famous Mario guy!
If I beat you, they'll make me Snifster number \n!\N\nIf I'm lucky!

\ÎIt couldn't be!
I can't believe it! It's...Mario!

Well... \NI guess I'll be returning to my castle now.
Outta my way, shortie!

Yeah... I'm a piece of work, ain't I?!

What's the big rush?
I'm Booster, and this is my famous tower\nof amusement.
However, a girl fell out of the sky and into my\nlap recently.
Since then, I've been busy keeping her happy\nand entertained.
I no longer have the time to play. So please\nenjoy yourself...at your own risk, that is!
Please refrain from bothering Booster.
\PWhat was that loud noise outside?\nCheck out Booster Pass!\Q
You wanna fight?
Um... Nice weather we're having.

I'm amazed you made it this far. Yes, quite\namazing you are!\Ž
Since you're here, maybe you could clear up\nsomething for me.
My bride-to-be is chanting,\n"MARIOHELPMEMARIOHELPME."\nIs she showing her happiness?
Hey, wait a second! Maybe "MARIO" is\nanother guy!
What if you're this "Mario" she keeps\ntalking about?
HE'S GONE?! That's not fair!
\ļI'm so hurt. I only wanted to play with him. Now,\nwhat expression should I be wearing at a time\nlike this?!
Now I remember! I should look like...THIS!
That didn't do it?
\ūGrrr...I ran out of bombs.
Well, so long!
Mario! You did come to rescue me! I was so\nfrightened and lonely.
But now that you're here...
The door won't open?
I think we need Booster's spell to undo the lock\non it. Oh, what should we do?
A\N...\Nha!
What should we do?!
Booster is returning, isn't he? I know! Hide\nsomewhere, and wait until he opens the door.
\PYou can move freely behind the curtains.\Q
\PGood luck hiding from Booster and his Snifsters.\Q
Boss, shouldn't we be concentrating on the girl?
Right!
Now, about the girl in my life, who thinks I should\nmarry her?
Well?\N Speak up!
A wedding ceremony would make a great party!
Ah, a party!\N We haven't had one of those.
It could be fun!\N So...what is a party?
Well, you drink punch and eat cake! I think.
Hmmm...\N Drink punch...eat cake? It sounds...\ncomplicated.
I don't know if I can muster the energy to do\nit...\N Let's walk through it once! It's wedding-\nrehearsal time!
We will now begin the ceremony.
Walk down the aisle with the—\KHey! Someone make\\n\Kher smile!\—beautiful bride-to-be.
Wait!\N Mario always shows up about now to ruin\nthe fun.
We've got to take that into consideration, you\nknow.\N Someone go and get the Mario doll.
\PIt isn't here.\Q
Of course it's here! You lazy slobs couldn't find\nwater if you were fish!
It's behind those curtains!\N Number one, you go\nand look.
\PNope, nothing here.\Q
I wouldn't go and lose my Mario doll, you idiots!
Argh!\N Number two, YOU look too!
\PI don't see anything.\Q
We can't give up! It's gotta be here somewhere.
Number three! It's your turn!
Wait a minute!
This is better than a party!\N Look out, 'cause\nhere I come!
Wait \Na \Nsecond! It's right up there. I found the\nMario doll!
But we'll NEVER be able to reach it up there.\N\nOh! The sorrow!
What am I gonna do...
I'm about to lose it...*sniffle*...
Goodness!\N You're so kind! Thank you for getting\nmy doll.
I'd like to reward you.\N Here, take this.
\PGot \!!\Q
May happiness follow you, wherever you go.
All right! Enough is enough.\N Cancel the\nrehearsal—we're going on with the show!
Here's the password!
\P\ !\Q
Hey, everybody!\N Did you see someone behind\nthe curtains, or was it just me?
How creepy! It's a pain, but I think we should\ncheck one more time.
Well? I really think someone's behind\nthose curtains!
I think one more peek is necessary.
G'na! \NIt's Mario!
That's impossible! He made it past all my traps...\N\nBut we're gonna trip him up!
H...huh?! That MUST be Mario!
Let's make sure. You! Check it out!
Harrumph! Just as I thought!
It IS Mario. Let's...wind him up!
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've a schedule to\nkeep.\N Move aside so I can open that door.
Here's the password!
\P\ !\Q
Wait!
You took all the trouble to come here...
so stick around!
Please, let me go! Won't you...please?\nPretty please?
Eh? \NHey, where's my bride-to-be?
I wanna play hide and seek too!
Yuck! I don't want to play ANYTHING with you!
What a poor sport! Well, we really should\nhurry along.
A yummy cake is waiting for us after we climb\nthis hill!
Let's go!
No! I don't want to marry you. Please let me go!
Help! Mario! Please help meeeeeee!
Uh-oh! It's Mario! \NWe didn't plan on this.
Mario, you aren't invited to our wedding!
Besides, we still have to have the rehearsal!
I'll be happy to race you to the wedding hall,\nbut...\Nyou'd better not get in my way.
Ready?
When you succeed at several Action Commands\nin a row, you'll get an Ally Buff.
The buff is different for each ally in the battle.\nOnly the bonus for active party members will be\nin effect.
Trying to take my bride away?\N Why don't you\ntake THIS instead!
What's the matter? The door's not opening\nor something?
Oh? Hold up...
Try it out with other party members to see what\nyou get.
After years of hard work and effort, I'm now\nSnifster number 4!
I'll wear the number proudly!
Phew...
I've been training to become one of Booster's\nSnifsters for three years!
If only Ma and Pa could see me now.
Yeehaw! \n　　Hurrah!\n　　　　I'm a Snifster!
I'm...speechless!
*shriek* \NThe boss only wants seven Snifsters!
All my training was in vain!
\PWhat a rip!\Q
Harrumph! I'm off to the arcade!
Normally, I welcome visitors to play with me and\nmy Snifsters.
We've got ourselves a way inside now, huh?\Ǵ

I'm the best photographer around. Would you\nlike a wedding portrait?
All right...
You'll have to excuse us!
Who's the kook who blew in screaming, "It's time\nfor MY wedding!"?
Just who does he think he is?!
Who's the guy with the scraggly beard?! He and\nPrincess Peach were...
No! Don't tell me...they're getting...MARRIED?
This must be a first! A perfect couple who isn't\ngoing to live happily ever after... I give up!
Hmmmm...

It was my dream to stay in the suite after we\ngot married!
This was supposed to be my wedding day...\nAll my plans have been ruined...
I'm not letting you in here! And you can forget\nabout the back entrance. It's locked. At least I\nTHINK it is...

You clowns! You don't break a door down when\nentering a room!
Shut it! \NShut it now! \NMove it, MOVE IT!
Mario! Is that you, Mario?! I'm in here! Hurry!\nGet me out of here!
We're pretty sure Mr. Mustache can't break in\nhere. But that turtle looks mean. He could\nbe trouble!
They have no idea what they're up against!

You do as you're told, and everything will be\njust...peachy.
You don't bring much to the party, but why\nnot help anyway? At least you'll feel like you\ndid something!
Owwwwww! Watch what you're doing!
Great...
I've dropped everything.
Booster, sir!
Booster, I, um...
Don't bother me now.
OK, everyone! \N\ćThe bride is growing impatient!\nLet the wedding begin!
What's this? \NWater...coming from your eyes?!\N\nAre you leaking, my dear?!
\PTastes salty!\Q
Booster, sir, uh... I believe that the bride may\nbe...uh...crying...
Crying? But that's what people do when\nthey're...sad! How disgusting!
That stuff must be corrosive! It tastes...like the\nsea! What could be making her...cry, anyway?
I believe she is crying because she has dropped\nsome of her...wedding gear.
Aha! Of course! \NBut those tears will ruin the\ncake! Make her stop before Mario breaks in!
\PBut...Mario's ALREADY in...\Q
Booster, sir, we have to find her things! The\nwedding can't go on without them!
We're still waiting on the cake too...
Ten-four, good buddy. \NYou find her stuff.\nI'll move the ceremony forward. Hurry!
Booster, sir, you're supposed to be on the right.\nThe bride should be on your left.
Just testing...
Like this, right?

Booster, sir!
There's a 70 percent chance the object you're\nstanding on...
...THIS thing's a cake?
OK, everyone! Here's the stumper.
How do we eat this?
I say we boil it!
Number 2, what do you say?
is a cake.
Way too messy!
Why don't you just swallow it?!
What?! In one gulp?
That's easier said than done!
Come, Booster!
You can do it! Open wide, please!
My nerves are shot.
Man, oh man.
I feel like I've forgotten to tie my cord before\na bungee jump!
Here it comes!
WAIT! WAIT!
Did the cake just move?
Concentrate, sir!
This doesn't feel right.
Mmmmmm...
Delicious!
Hang on. I'm feeling a feeling. Yes... Yes!
It's so good, it makes me want to cry!
Congratulations, sir.
The wedding is now officially over!
Thanks, everyone.
It's a wrap. Let's go.
That was wonderful. Mario, you're my knight in\nshining armor.
Finally...let's get back.
Oh, what a day! Can you believe it?! I almost got\nmarried to that...thing!
But I... I hope someone marries me someday!
\PPeach, princess of the Mushroom\nKingdom, has joined the party.\Q
Hey, you're a little short on Frog Coins!
Please make yourself at home.
Please get to work!
Keep working! You're not getting any breaks.

\ɚ\ɛWhen I'm the one who saved your skin?!
I saw some people who looked like chefs go\ninto the wedding hall through the back way.\nWeird, huh?
Please see our guests out.
Bellhop! Escort these guests over to our suite!
My shoes, \Nmy ring, \Nmy brooch, \Nand...\Nmy crown!
Sir! You have stayed over 200 times for the price\nof just ONE NIGHT!
I shall receive 100 coins for each night you\nhave extended your stay!
Unable to pay it, eh? Why am I not surprised?\nIn that case, I'll take everything you have on you\nnow, and you'll work off the rest!
All your coins—even the Frog Coins—are gone!
Hee-hee-hee-hee... I'm really, REALLY sorry\nabout before...

Come on, come on... Don't be such a poor sport.
Wanna play?\n\RYou bet!\nNope.\S
It's not so bad being stuck in this room... It's not\nlike I get lonely or anything like that.
Mario!\ŧ
That creepy guy just left! Does that mean we\ncan go on with our wedding?
Oh, Raz! I'm so happy!
Let's get this wedding over with so we can stay\nin the suite, and then go on our honeymoon!
Let's do it!
All right... You'll have to excuse us!
OK, everyone! We're gonna start this from the\nbeginning! Back inside, please!
It's our turn next.
I wish the people before us would hurry up!\nWe've been waiting for 30 minutes now.
That Raz... He found himself a real peach!
The couple that got married? Looks like they\nwent on their honeymoon to the south island.
She's so gorgeous...
I can't take it anymore...
Ahhh... That's better.
Raini's so beautiful...
If you stay in the hotel suite a couple of times,\nI heard they give you some sorta gift... A pretty\nnice gift too.
Yes, indeed!\´ 'Tis a melody...of celebration!\´ \nComposed by the one and only Toadofsky.
\PHey, what are you doing?\Q

Shhhh... Quiet, now.
It's lovely, isn't it?
I wish you a happy life.

Honey, I don't want you to wander too far\noff, now!
We're finally man and wife.
I wish it were ski season!
Pipe down and relax.
I wish those two a wonderful life together.\nHope they don't fight too often!
Oh man, is it over yet? I hate getting my\npicture taken.
OK, get a little closer now. Ready? All right,\none...two... \NHey, you there!
Why the long face? This isn't a funeral,\nyou know.
All right, on the count of three, \Nsay\n"Cheeeeeese!"
It's going to be held here?! This is\nabsolutely gorgeous!
I came to see where the wedding's gonna\nbe held.
Mario!
The chancellor is waiting!\<\ȇ We're going back\nnow, right?!
\ROK!\nNo.\S
Mario!
The chancellor must be worried sick about us.\nYou saw him before!\Ȣ C'mon, let's GO.
\ROK!\nNo!\S
\PThere, that's the way.\Q
Mario!
If we don't get the princess back, WE'LL be\ncharged with kidnapping! Let's go!
\ROh, all right.\nNO!\S
\PThere, that's the way.\Q
Mario!
No one—NO ONE—is authorized to kidnap the\nprincess except ME! It just wouldn't be right!\nLet's take her back already!
\ROK...\nForget it!\S
\PThere, that's the way.\Q
\PEnough already!\Q
For my honeymoon, I was thinking of going to\nSeaside Town.
Were you able to rescue the princess from\nBowser, that good for noth...
Eh? Wh...what was that...odd noise?
Say hey! Welcome back. The chancellor's been\nworrying about you ever since you left. Come\nsee me later!
Mario, welcome home! Please, go in.
Mario, welcome home! Please, go in.
Oooh! It's good to see you back. Look what I\nfound in the wallet you returned to me.
It's yours, isn't it?
\PGot a Frog Coin!\Q
Enough with the chatter... On your way, now.
Welcome back, Mario! All's well here!
Mario, go see my brother jump. He's been\npracticing nonstop!
Boing, boing, boing... Hey, Mario! I can outjump\nYOU now!
\RImpressive!\nKeep practicing, kid.\S
\PALL RIGHT!\Q
Thanks a bunch.
Hello, Mario! Oh, hi, Mallow. Didn't see you\nthere! Well, what can I get you two? What are\nyou looking for?
All right! YES! I'm done here.
You want this? It's only 500 coins.\n\RWell, sure!\nNo.\S
You need more coinage.
Want me to teach you?\n\RYes, please!\nI already know.\S
High score if you hit the shells with the stars\nfired from the beetle. If you get hit, recover by\nfiring continuously. Just do it!
Aww, you're no fun.
Suit yourself.
Want me to teach you?\n\RYes, please!\nI already know.\S
Mario! Welcome back! You look like you're in\none piece!
P...P...Princess!
I'm finally home! With Mario...\<and some\nwonderful...new friends! They saved my life.
Let's go find the chancellor.
Lead on!
Come on, Mario. We mustn't keep the\nchancellor waiting!
The princess hasn't returned yet. Can you\nimagine how the chancellor must feel?
Princess!
Hello, Granny. I'm back. I hope I didn't worry you\ntoo much...
Nonsense, dear. By the way, have you seen the\nchancellor yet?
I was just on my way. See you later!
Run along and talk to the chancellor right away.\nWe'll talk later, dear.
\PMario!\Q
Stop peeking into other people's rooms!
Chancellor! The...the princess... She's back!
Thank goodness! This has been a\ntrue nightmare!
I'm a nervous wreck!
I know I've worried everyone... But I'm fine!\nI can take care of myself.
With a little help from Mario!
Come, everyone! Let's get out of this\ndrafty doorway!
Mario, I hope you know how thankful we are!
But...you MUST tell me one thing! How on earth\ncan you trust Bowser?
Trust...Bowser? What are you talking about?!
Mario! What are you doing with...
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
\PEGADS!\Q
Chancellor!
Listen, everyone—relax! Mario's got things\nunder control!
Y-yes... I see.
Bowser...perhaps it's time you told us your story!
What, exactly, did you mean when you said you\nhad "bigger fish to fry"?
\KCan't...tell 'em...\Nthe truth... \NIf this gets out...\NI'm finished!\
Excuse me, sir. Perhaps I can set the stage,\nand the others can add their comments along\nthe way!
The princess, Bowser, and Mario were thrown in\ndifferent directions after a terrible explosion...
\ǅ\ǈSomething huge crashed through the Star Road\nhigh above Bowser's place...and...
\ǉ\ǹand went...\N\<
\Ǌ\PKABOOM!\nRight into Bowser's Keep!\Q\x
It was a gigantic sword!
Now Bowser's Keep has been taken over\nby monsters who work for some creep\nnamed Smithy.
They've thrown me out of my own... I mean...\nI decided to take a vacation!
They CAN'T do this to me! Anyway, I was\nworking on a plan to get my house back, when...
Mario walked up to me and BEGGED me to let\nhim join my minions!
\ǖI had no choice but to let him in. It was pathetic.
It's OK, Mario. We know Bowser's stretching the\ntruth a little!
And...Mallow...how about you? Why are you\ntraveling with Mario?
Well, because Mario's helping me find my real\nhome. And my parents...
That's why we're on the road together.
What?! This is dreadful news! Awful! Horrible!
I hope you find your real parents soon!
And...um, Geno, was it? Why are you and Mario...
The Star Road has been destroyed. I'm here to\nfix it.
Mario is helping me search for the Star Pieces.\nI need them to rebuild the road...
Star...Pieces?
The Star Road grants our wishes! Unless we find\nall the Star Pieces and fix the Star Road...
we can kiss our dreams goodbye!
What?! This is dreadful news! Awful! Horrible!
Isn't it?
Indeed. For example, say Bowser kidnapped you.
Without the aid of the Star Road, you'd probably\nnever be rescued!
Actually, that sounds pretty good to me! Let's\njust forget about these...star...things!
Great, Bowser. Then you can just kiss your\nprecious keep goodbye!
Huh?! What?!
Hmm. \NLet's see. If Mario can't find the stars...\N\nPeach will be MINE!
But I won't get my keep back unless Mario finds\nthe stars! So if I want my keep back...\Nwe need\nthose star things, but... Run that past me again!
Urgh! \NJust ignore that idiot!\Ʌ\Ɇ\ɇ\ɉ I don't think I could\ntake a world without wishes...
\ɊWe need to go and find those Star Pieces now!
Princess!
You can't be serious! You're not thinking of\njoining them, are you?!
This is sheer madness... You're a princess!\nWhat will people say?!
I don't care! \NThings seem so hopeless\nright now...
I'm tired... I think I need to lie down in my room\nfor a while.
Mario... Mallow... Geno, and...Bowser, you too...\N\nGood luck!
Now then!
Thanks to Mario, the princess is back. I now\ndeclare this date to be known forever as...
Hey, wait a minute! You don't suppose...
Could it have been this "Smithy" who attacked\nour kingdom?
I fear we have no cause to rejoice. In fact, Mario,\nwe must ask you for yet another favor.
Please...on behalf of all of us, you must defeat\nSmithy. It is the only way we shall ever live in\npeace again.
\PPrincess Peach is home safe, but...she\nhas decided to stay at the kingdom!\Q
Excellent job, Mario!
Thank you, Mario!
Happy hunting, Mario!
All we can do is wait here. Don't let us down!
The princess is back! I humble myself\nbefore you!
Oh dear! The princess went out looking for you.\nPlease find her!
Good luck, Mario...
\PFound Peach's ???\Q
Go on now—return it!
\PLooks like we've been scolded.\Q
\PMario!\Q
Avoid fighting the pointy monsters up on\nStar Hill.
\PWait! Don't leave me!\Q
Please, Mario! Take me along with you, please!
Don't worry. Granny helped me through this one,\nso no one will ever notice that I'm gone!
So...let's go find us a star!
Hmmm... But I wonder where it could be. I have\nabsolutely no idea! Do you?
Mario! At times like these...
What should we do?
We should ask Grandpa! My grandpa\nshould know!
OK then! Let's do it!
\PJust as I thought! Peach joins\nthe party once again!\Q
You can now play the pre-owned game Beetle\nMania. Try to get a high score!
Play it by selecting Play Game from the menu.
I'll make sure that Princess Peach will be able to\nlead a safe—and long—life! You can bet on it!
The princess is resting now.
Granny...thanks for putting up with all my\nselfish demands.
Don't worry, Princess. A little adventure will do\nyou good!
See the world! Make friends! Help\ndestroy Smithy...
Mario's beside me! Everything's going to be all\nright. So don't worry, OK?
You take care, Granny, you hear?
I feel like I'm growing younger just talking with\nyou people!
\PMario!\Q
Stop peeking into other people's rooms!
Our guest is resting. Please be quiet.
...I'm resting up for Mother Brain.
\PTo Marrymore\Q
\PTalk to the flower, and the star gate will open.\Q
\PTo Star Hill\Q
\PTalk to the flower, and the star gate will open.\Q
This is Star Hill. Wishes, which were transformed\nat the Star Road, fall to here.
But...
Some wishes that haven't been granted yet are\nfalling because Smithy destroyed the Star Road.
The Frog Sage mentioned a Star Piece on\nthis hill.
Let's see if we can find it.
\PWish I had some Cricket Jam.\Q
\PI wish for everyone to be happy.\Q
\PI hope my baby's cute!\Q
\PCan't wait to start a family.\Q
\PI wish I weren't such a crybaby.\Q
This one's private! Who do you think you are,\nspying on other people's wishes?
C'mon, our quest for the Star Pieces\nis important!
Everyone's counting on us! We've got to hurry!
Sorry about that. It's just that I'm embarrassed\nabout my wish.
\PIf I could JUST get that melody!\Q
\PThe hunger! Oh, for some food! \Q
\PI vant to be a vald-class baker.\Q
\PPlease let Mallow find his way home.\Q
Why, this wish is...
It's from my mom and dad.
They're wishing for me to come home!
*sniffle*...
This isn't the time to be crying! They're waiting\nfor me to come home!
Come on, Mario—we've got a busy schedule to\nkeep. I'll make you eat dust if you don't hurry!
\PMay Mallow fix the Starway!\Q
\PI wanna be the best treasure\nhunter in the world.\Q
\PI hope I become famous.\Q
\P(Wish I could run faster.)\Q
\PI wanna help out my older brother, Mario.\Q
\PYou've come a long way, but\nyour journey's not over yet.\nThere are three more Star Pieces.\Q
Mario! There's a Star Piece to be found!
Hang in there!
So a Star Piece fell here after all.
I think there's a place called Seaside Town\nup ahead.
I hear that it's a busy resort town, so the people\nthere might know something. Let's go see!
Where to next then?
I have been thinking. Is it possible that the bride\nat Booster's Tower is the princess?
So! Peach was the bride after all?
You'd better hurry and rescue her before\nshe's...married!
Good work, Mario. You rescued Peach.
Why don't you head back to the Mushroom\nKingdom? I'm sure the chancellor is worried.
I wonder when my next bride will fall from\nthe sky?
What are you babbling about?
Why should I marry you?
...
\ĂWhat a wonderful thing to say!
Well, if it isn't Mallow! I do have the latest news\nabout falling stars, in fact.
A large star's been sighted on Star Hill.
Hey, Grandpa! Have you heard anything about\nthe Star Pieces?
Hmm. It does seem likely that a Star Piece would\nfall there.
We should go explore Star Hill right away.
Eee-hee-hee! You found the star! Well done!
But your journey ends here. You are so gullible!\nDon't you know who I am?
\ÌI'm Speardovich, a member of Smithy's\ngang. Shocked?
It's no wonder! My impersonation of an ordinary\nperson was flawless.
Your search for the stars has worried Smithy.
So if I take that star back to him, I'll earn brownie\npoints. This is the way to get ahead!
It's futile to try and fight me. Just hand it over,\nnice and easy.
\ROK.\nGet serious!\S
Eee-hee-hee! And to think I got the star without\neven soiling my hands!
I'm such a genius, it scares me sometimes.\nNo wonder I'm so important!
All right, everyone—listen up. We're returning to\nthe castle! Our ride should be here about now.
So that's how you want to play it? What do you\nthink will happen to the real inhabitants of\nSeaside Town?
What are you doing? No! Don't do that!
\PNo! Please stop!\Q
\<Ack!\N
No...you wouldn't! \NThe two of you are\ngoing to—
Nooo! Please not there!
\<Aieeee\N.\N.\N.\N
Harrumph! \NYou can't treat me this way!
\<AYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIEEEEEEEE\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIYAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\NE\NE\NE\NE\`...\a
I can't \Nbear \Nthis!\N
\<.\N.\N.\N
Now isn't it a shame for an innocent old man to\nbe tickled like this?
\PIt's locked.\Q
The Blade's late. What's taking it so long?
We need to get out of here.
This is just great! Mario caught up with us.
Only one thing we can do now. Although we may\nrust a little, we'll have to swim for it.
Not so fast there! \NThat star's a gift to me\nmate, Mario.
You spineless dogs have no code of honor!
\ØWe'll make you walk the plank!
Johnny, maybe we should leave Mario the\npleasure of wrapping things up here.
Eee-hee! I guess we'll have to take our\ndisguises off now.
Group formation!
\PSmithy is now in the race\nfor the Star Pieces!\Q
\PWhat horrible surprises might\nhe have in store for Mario?\Q
Been awhile since people came round here.
Thank you. Drop by again.
Since you shopped here, I'll tell you this. The\nship sank into the briny sea because a giant\nsquid attacked it.
Some people went in to survey it, but they never\ncame back.
And what might you be looking for?
Thank you. Drop by again.
There's a page from the travel log.\n\RLet's take a look at it...\nLooks boring.\S
We're done for... A giant squid just got a hold of\nus. This ship's going down fast...

That's amazing! No one's ever whipped Johnny!
So you're THE Mario, eh? Arr-harr-harr!\nNot much to look at.
Well, this star fell into my sea, so it's mine!
If you want it, you'll have to fight for it!
Fuwa-ha-ha... Not bad, fellas.
How about it, Mario? Mario versus me! Wanna\nmix it up?
Good fun! And good for you too!
Crew! Look alive and cheer me on!
I'm impressed, matey!
You've earned the star.
Think of it as a souvenir of our fight!
You must've REALLY wanted that star...
Now go on! Get outta here before I change\nmy mind.
You again?! So, have you already beaten that\nSmithy creature?
Yo, mate! Just 'cause we're buds doesn't give ya\nthe right to jump on my head.
Johnny's our main man. He even fights in his\nsleep! We'd follow him anywhere.

If you...want to enter the ocean, jump into...\nthe whirlpools.
You will find the village elder...in his house.\nHe is...the most respected person here.
You're...collecting stars, right? Only...three\nmore to go.
Finally! It took you long enough!
I am the elder of this village.
I got to my exalted station in life by...pleasing\nmy superiors, which is something I do well.
A star has fallen into the ocean. I need it for...\na certain purpose. You...must find it for me.
You'll find the star in Jonathan Jones' territory.\nDon't worry—you can beat him.
\KAt least I THINK you can.\\nHurry and bring back the star!
Hello there. You're Mario, right?
Do you remember me? We met at Tadpole Pond\nwhen I was still a tadpole.
I've graduated from the Frog Sage's school,\nand now I'm searching for the meaning of life.
It's been so quiet around here, it's almost eerie.\nIs something going on?
It probably doesn't concern me. But if you have\nany Frog Coins, I've got some neat items to sell.
Good to see you again. Did you have a chance\nto accumulate many Frog Coins?
I'm...just a...customer.
Don't...tell me. You want...supplies. I know.
Thank you...very much.
In the middle...of the ocean is a pirate...ship.\nYou'll find a... I mean, there's a...

A star...has fallen into the sea. The pirate...\nprobably...
I mean that...man... Uh... Jonathan Jones...\nprobably...has it. He's nasty.
Oops, sorry. I'm all out of items.

\PKnowin' you, it must've been a\nbreeze knockin' down Speary, eh?\Q
\PBy the way, my pirates say they saw\na huge axe flyin' across the sky.\Q
\PIt's probably one of Smithy's\nnasty friends. Go get him, pal!\Q
\PWell, my gills are failing on me, so\nI'll be headin' back down. Drop in\nwhenever you have time, OK?\Q
Your true mate,\n\-Jonathan "Johnny" Jones\
\PIt's locked.\Q
Phew, thanks so much! I've had enough of\ncramped, dirty old places like this.
Hey, fella! You got us out of a bind!\nPeace, brother!
It was mighty unpleasant in here. Thanks for\nhelpin' us out.
Thank you!\N\n\nYeah, thanks a lot!
Be sure to stop by.\N\n\nYeah, stop on by.
Thank you for freeing us.
I've got to get back to work now, but stop by the\ninn! See ya there!
Ah, Mario.
Thank you for saving our little town of Seaside.
Being the most important person in the village,\nit was inevitable that I would be tortured.
Are you immune to tickle tortures, Mario?
Oh yes...this is for you. Please take it.
Although they tortured me, I'm sure it was\nnothing compared to your trials, Mario.
I'd hate to have to go through that tickle torture\nagain though!
I've gotta leave now, so please take this.
They did torture me a little, but it's nothing to\nworry about.
Here, this is for you.
You exposed the fake townspeople and gave up\nyour star to save us!
Please take this with our thanks.
\PReceived 1 coin!\Q
\PGot a \!!\Q

I'm so relieved that all of the townspeople were\nall right in the end.
Can you believe he didn't just kidnap 'em, he\nhad the nerve to lock 'em up too?
Me and my minions would never pull a stunt\nlike that!
Mario, how nice of you to stop by.
It's quite a trek from your place, isn't it?
Out here, there aren't many people passing\nthrough, so it gets awful lonely sometimes...
Please rest up before you go. It'll only cost you\n15 coins.
\ROK.\nNo.\S
Really? I seem to recall a certain someone\nkidnapping me not too long ago.
You don't have enough coins?
That's OK, just pay me whatever you can. I know\nyou need to rest.
Ghrk... But no one got hurt, right? So all's well\nthat ends well! Mwa ha ha!
C'mon, let's scram already. The mold in here's\nbad for my sensitive nostrils.
I've never seen the sea before. It sure is vast.\nDefinitely worth the trip!
OK, some other time then. Have a safe trip.
Hear, hear. We should see the sights in town\nnow that it's back to normal.
Maybe someone here can point us toward the\nnext Star Piece!
Oh, hello there! You were so brave to rescue us,\nand I'm so thankful...
But listen...maybe it's time you thought a little\nmore about what you...wear...
Accessorizing is big business these days!\nSee anything you like here?
Let's see if we can't make you look a little more\nsnazzy. That blue-collar look is SO dated!
I hear there's a strange shop in this town that's\nlooking for beetles.
A youngster from Tadpole Pond recently moved\nhere for good.
Hey, hey, hey! I'm the Mushroom Boy!
Did you know that hidden amongst the regular\nMushrooms, are some special ones?\nUnreal, huh?
I'll give you items in return for those\nspecial Mushrooms.
But you've got to taste them to find out what\nkind they are. So I'll take a nibble first.
I'm hoping for a special Mushroom, but even if it\nisn't, at least I'll get a meal out of it.
You have any Mushrooms?\n\RYes.\nNope.\S
Hey, you don't have any Mushrooms.
See you around, man. Come again, all right?
Hey, far out! *munch* *munch*
That was just a regular Mushroom! Thanks for\nthe snack.
Ooh! This one's a berry mushroom!
All right! Like, this is unreal! It's a\nrippin' mushroom.
Whoo-eee! This is most excellent! It's a\nflower mushroom.
I'll give you a \!. Oh boy, I'm stuffed.
I'll give you a \! for it.\nHey, thanks, dude.
\PGot a \!!\Q
Hi, Mario!
We've got a lot of health foods at our store.\nYou gotta treat your body right!
Welcome to our store. We encourage\nhealthy lifestyles.
Mario, if it's a star that you're looking for, I may\nbe able to help you.
At the far side of Land's End is a town made up\nof reformed monsters.
A mouse came by the other day, and I overheard\nhim boasting about a "star" of theirs.
I don't know exactly where this town is located,\nbut if you follow the road, you'll get there.
By the way, have you met my, uh, long-term\nhouseguest, who's taken over my second floor?
Smithy and his gang have disrupted business\naround here.
Why don't you help us out and do some\nshopping before you leave?
Hello there. You're Mario, right?
Do you remember me? We met at Tadpole Pond,\nwhen I was still a tadpole.
I've graduated from the Frog Sage's school,\nand now I'm searching for the meaning of life.
It was really quiet around here until a little while\nago. What happened?
That reminds me, do you have any Frog Coins?\nI've got some special items to sell.
Good to see you again. Did you have a chance\nto accumulate many Frog Coins?
\PBeetle Bug Price List\nMale: 50 coins\nFemale: 1 coin\Q

Welcome to Beetles Are Us!
We run a beetle business here.
Want an explanation?\n\RYes.\nNo.\S
OK, I'll explain the system.
First you need to purchase a Beetle Box, which\nwill cost you 50 coins.
Then go to Booster Hill, where there are\nmany beetles.
If you bring back the Beetle Box filled with\nbeetles, you can trade them in for coins and\nFrog Coins.
Check the menu list for more information.
Please come again.
Welcome to Beetles Are Us!
If this is your first time, you need to pay an\ninitiation fee.
The fee is 100 coins. Together with the 50 coins\nfor the Beetle Box, that's 150 coins.
Is it a deal?\n\ROuch! Well, OK...\nNo, I'll pass.\S
Come back with more cash!
Thank you.
I need to see some ID, please.
Everything looks fine.
Here's your Beetle Box. Good luck, and\nhappy hunting!
Welcome to Beetles Are Us!
You haven't even caught one? Come on!\nGet serious!
Good job! You made \6 \coins coin coins\.
Oh wow! You've got a Golden Beetle too!\nHere's \5 Frog \Coins Coin Coins\.
Good doing business with you.

A Beetle Box costs 50 coins.
\ROK!\nNo, thanks.\S
Come back with more cash!
Well then, good luck to you!
Welcome to my weapons shop.
Please come in and browse. I'm running an\narmor shop!
Oops, sorry. I'm all out of items.
As the immortal bard once said, "I'm sold out."\nAnd so, farewell!
Welcome to the Sky Bridge! It's a big tourist\nattraction here. Yaaahoo!
Wanna challenge it?\n\RSure!\nNo.\S
OK, I'll need five coins from you.
Don't have enough coins? Then you can't take\nthe challenge!
All righty! Take care then!
Welcome to the Sky Bridge! It's a big tourist\nattraction here. Yaaahoo!
Going up? I'll give you a boost. Just jump on\ntop of me.
Ahhh! Haven't been here in a while. I've been\nbusy traveling around.
Where are you heading? Is it Monstro Town by\nany chance?
\RYes.\nNope.\S
OK, listen up. Look for the whirl where the ant\npops up, and proceed after it.
Keep following it, and you'll find your way\nunderground.
Once there, Monstro Town's just around the\ncorner. I'll see you there.
Oh, I thought you were lost or something. Never\nmind—I'll see you around.
Oh! Hello again.
What did you do that for?
You won't get any coins from jumping on me.\nIt's Wiggler or Shogun you ought to look for.
Isn't this incredible?
It really does look like the edge of the world,\ndoesn't it?
It's too spooky for me! I'm heading back to\nMonstro Town. See ya!
Oh! Hello again.
You're looking for a star? I'll sell one for 400\ncoins. Are you interested?
\RYes!\nNo.\S
Suit yourself. See ya!
I have a star to sell, but you don't have\nenough coins.
You want a better star?
\RYes!\nNo.\S
Come back later. I'll find it by then.
I found an incredible star. I'll sell it for 800 coins.
\RBuy it.\nPass.\S
Ten-hut! All troops in position!
Mario, your mission is to scale the cliff by\njumping shell to shell.
Don't give up! Sure and steady does it. Now try\nit again.
Mission accomplished! Elapsed time\nis \9.
Not bad for a civilian!
That's quite good. Keep up the great work!
Distinguishing work, soldier!
Very commendable! That's quite a time you set.
Here's the next best thing! A Troopa Medal!
You'd be a great Paratroopa, if only you had\nwings and a shell.
Here's a little something from me.
\PGot a \!!\Q
That's quite good.
This is a dead end, so it's best to turn back now.
You're looking for a star? Didn't you find one in\nthe treasure box next to the trampoline?
This trampoline will get you to the surface. I'll let\nyou use it for 100 coins.
For 100 coins, this shortcut will get you back to\nthe surface.
\ROK.\nNo, thanks.\S
I'll tell your fortune for 50 coins.
Do you want your fortune told? It'll cost\n50 coins.
\RYes.\nNo.\S
See the three faces on the wall? Hit them in any\norder, and you'll receive your fortune.
If you proceed through the pipe next door...\nlooks like you'll have a great meal sometime\nin the future.
If you proceed through the pipe next door...\nsome tasty snacks are awaiting you in the future.
If you proceed through the pipe next door...\nyou'll have many friends in the future.
If you proceed through the pipe next door...\nyou'll have plenty of good things to look\nforward to.
If you proceed through the pipe next door...\nyou'll find some rare items.
If you proceed through the pipe next door...\nyou'll be very happy with what you find.
The yellow tile will get you to the next room.\nYour fortune determines which room you'll\narrive at.
If you're lucky, you'll run into Belome, and\nMonstro Town will be just beyond him.
Sorry, I'm not accepting visitors past\nmy bedtime.
Mmm, I'm so hungry! Wish I had something\nto eat!
Give me the key, and I'll let you pass through.
That key you have there looks pretty tasty.
\RGive him the key.\nKeep the key.\S
Hmm, you look so tasty. I think I'll just have\na snack!
Oh no, not again!
I'm starving!
Time to go home for dinner.
Goodbye, boys and girls!
Ahhh! Haven't been here in a while. I've been\nbusy traveling around.
That pipe is a shortcut to my home,\nMonstro Town.
I'll see you there.
Oh! Hello again.
\PIt's been sealed.\Q
\PIt's been sealed.\Q
\PLook! The Shiny Stone is reacting!\Q

Oh, my! A traveler from afar.
Welcome to Monstro Town, where many\nmonsters mingle. I'm the landlady,\nMonstermama.
A star, you say? Oh, you're here to see\nOUR star!
She's upstairs, so feel free to go and take a look\nfor yourself.
If it's a star you're looking for, there's\none upstairs.
Hope you find your star!
I've been all around the world.
But the strangest person I met is this old geezer\nin Rose Town.
He really is weird, but definitely worth meeting.
Sometimes if you jump at the right places,\na treasure box will pop out of thin air.
Anything like this happen to you?
These treasure boxes are known as Hidden\nTreasures, because they appear out of nowhere.
You think you've found them all, but you still\nhave \7 Hidden \Treasures Treasure Treasures\ left.
Wow, you've found all the Hidden Treasures.
So, what do you think? Isn't our star adorable?
She's so talented too! Folks come to see\nher from afar.
Starbees? Oh, Star Piece! Nope, not familiar\nwith 'em.
So you came all the way out here to search for\na Star Piece? It must be really important.
This is the last place on land. If you can't find\nit here...
the only place left is up!
So! You wanna go there? Ha! You're an\nopen book!
OK, here's what you need to do. There's a secret\npassage to the sky at...Bean Valley!
But first you must scale the cliff beyond the\ndesert to get there.
Since you're such a nice guy, I'll introduce you\nto someone that can help you.
\PParatroopas, I need you!\Q
What was our flying time, troops?
8.52 seconds, Sergeant!
Paratroopas reporting for duty, ma'am!
We're 0.52 seconds late!
I hold myself personally accountable for the\ndelay, ma'am!
Still as rigid as ever about your rules\nand regulations?
No need to bother with the protocol around me,\nSergeant. I've got a favor to ask of you.
Yes, ma'am! Anything we can do for a civilian.
This fellow here really wants to get to\nBean Valley.
Could you help him scale the cliff?
Understood, ma'am!
The orders are, "Get Mustache over the cliff"!\nWe WILL succeed!
We will now deploy ourselves to the cliff at\nLand's End.
Paratroopas, keep a tight formation!
We have liftoff!
They're odd but trustworthy. Good luck with\nyour search!
So, the Super Jump is your specialty, right?
Those multiple jumps of yours are\npretty amazing!
I heard that your record for consecutive jumps\nstands at \8. How DO you do it?
Jump at least 30 times in a row, and I'll give\nyou a prize!
A record like that deserves a prize!
\PGot an \!!\Q
According to my source, it's impossible to jump\nmore than 100 times.
You've proven your point, so let's give this\ncompetition a rest!
\PGot a \!!\Q
I heard your record for jumping stands at \8\nright now.
Think you can do 30 in a row?
Wow, you did it! You hit 30 jumps.
All right, here's your prize.
Super Jumps are old hat now! You've earned the\ntitle of "Master Super Jumper"!
You there! Rumor has it that you're quite an\naccomplished jumper.
I may be outjumped, but you're totally\noutpumped!
...The strong, silent type, eh?
Don't you dig these vibes?
It's really weird. Sometimes I hear the guy\nnext door.
He's always mumbling about a "crystal" this and\nan "evil" that.
Isn't a crystal some kind of a shiny rock...or\nsomething? I know I've seen those somewhere!
I think our neighbor moved away.
Greetings.
I am Culex, Dark Knight of Vanda.
I have crossed into this dimension to fight for\nthe Dark Mage.
You who stand before me... Where does your\ndepth come from? Why are you rendered so\nthree-dimensionally?
The evil power that gave me life mapped out this\nflat plane as my form.
You are formed from a power unknown to\nme. I wish to gain the secret of your three-\ndimensional world!
You will enter combat against me?
\RYes.\nUh...\S
En garde!
You are wise to hesitate.
Without any weapon or armor, you have\nno chance.
You have returned to accept my challenge?
Now will you fight me?\n\RYes.\nNo!\S
I am matter...
I am antimatter...
I can see your past...
I can see your future...
I consume time...
And I will consume you!
Aaah! Your spirit...is strong!
This legendary strength is the power of that third\ndimension. It is far mightier than the forces of\nmalevolence could dream.
I will treasure this memento of my journey here.
Perhaps in another time, another game, we may\nhave been mortal enemies...
Someday I will gain the power of this third\ndimension, and those forces will visit a land\nnot yet mapped. Until that time...
Take this. Treasure it as a keepsake of our fight.
\PGot a \!!\Q
\PFarewell, champion knight!\Q
Yes, just a minute! I'll be there in a second.
Oh my!
Goomhilde, what are you doing here?
Bowser... It's been ages, hasn't it?
Sorry about going AWOL on you. I ran away\nbecause I was scared to fight Smithy.
A lot has happened since then, but look how far\nI've come. I'm managing this store now.
And look, here are my little ones. Come on,\nshow your manners, and greet Uncle Bowser.
Hi, Uncle Bowser!
Although I can't fight for you, I still have some\nitems you can use.
Maybe you'll find it in your heart to forgive me if\nI can help you get equipped!
Don't worry.
\ÙI'm not angry with you. I've got new minions now,\nand we're going to reclaim my castle!
You go on with your life here. I wish you\nthe best.
What can I get you?
We want to help too! Please, please, can we?
\PFeel free to rest here.\Q\n\~The Three Musty Fears\
Nice to meet ya! I'm Greaper.
Hi, I'm Boo.
And I'm Dry Bones...
We are the Three Musty Fears!
He's sleeping.
Boy, he sure is.
Check those bubbles coming out of his nose!
Maybe he can still hear us while he's asleep?
Hey you! We want to play a round of\n"Find the Flag."
Right! We'll each hide a flag somewhere around\nthe world.
Yeah. Find all three flags, and you'll get an\nawesome prize.
We'll go and hide the flags.
See you when we get back!
They'll be back!
I'm back! I hid my flag...behind a wooden flower.
I'm hooooome! My flag's under a green bed.
I'm back! You'll never guess my spot!\nIt's between "O" and "A."
Our flags are invisible, so search VERY carefully\nwhen you think you've found the spot!
My flag's behind a wooden flower.
So you found my flag, huh?
My flag's underneath a green bed.
Oh, you found my flag!
My flag's between "O" and "A."
Whoa, you found my flag.
Good job! You found all three flags.
Hey, you're not half bad!
You did pretty well!
We had a great time too. Thanks for playing\nour game!
Now the grand prize giveaway!
Hey, he's not wearing our medal!
Look! He's wearing our medal!
Farewell and good morning!
\PThanks for coming by.\Q
Who is it? Sorry, but the sensei isn't in.
Oh my gosh!
Jagger?!
Bowser! I haven't seen you for so long.
I've been studying here at the dojo under the\nsensei Jinx because...
To tell you the truth, I... I knew I couldn't\nbeat Smithy.
That's why I'm here now. Someday I'm going to\nreturn and make you proud!
...Don't worry about me.
\ÎI've got new minions now, and we're going to\ntake back my castle.
You stick to your guns! Train like there's\nno tomorrow!
My sensei is out right now, but he'll be\nback shortly.
In the meantime, will you accept a challenge\nfrom me?
\RSure.\nNo.\S
Great! You know that I'm not going to make it\neasy for you, right?
Wow! I'm flattered to think that YOU'RE afraid\nof me.
Yikes! You're tough!
Yikes! I guess that was to be expected.
Mario, you're a top-notch fighter!
You did well for your inexperience, Jagger.
Sensei! Have you been here all along?
Hmmm. You felt my ki, didn't you? Not bad for\na novice!
Your fighting style... It isn't as foolproof as\nyou think.
I'll accept a challenge any day.
Now this should be interesting. Can you beat\nTHE master, Mario?
You wish to challenge me?\n\RYes!\nNo.\S
All right. Let's see what you're capable of.
All right, you asked for it. And no crying if you\nget hurt!
Watch closely, Jagger. You're about to see your\nsensei in action.
Tsk, tsk. Afraid, are we?
Phew! Simply...AMAZING!
I guess I underestimated you. You pack quite\na punch!
But don't let it go to your head, because I let\nyou have that round. Let's have a rematch.
Still haven't had enough?
It isn't often that I have someone this\ncompetitive to spar with!
All right, this match will be the one that counts,\nsince I'm placing my reputation on the line!
Whoa... \NYou are the stronger champion,\nno doubt about it.
My reputation was staked on this last fight,\nso I've lost the title of "Sensei."
From today, you are the sensei of this dojo.
Please take this belt, which only the highest-\nranking fighter in the dojo can wear.
\PGot a \!!\Q
We will rename the dojo "Mario-Style Dojo"\nand incorporate your jump technique into\nthe training.
Jagger and I will start our training immediately.
One thousand warm-up jumps! Ready, begin!
Mario Sensei, the new regimen will strengthen\nus, right?
Master! Share your wisdom with us!
Yeah! I did it! I never thought I'd beat Mario!
You didn't let me win, did you? Come back\nanytime, and we'll try it again if you want.
It's not like Mario to run away from a fight.
Do you know what your weak point is? You\nhaven't put in enough training time.
But don't worry—in time you'll grow stronger.\nCome back after you level up.
How disappointing! Running away during the\nmiddle of a match?
Come back when you've leveled up sufficiently,\nand we'll try again.

SHUDDAP!
King Nimbus' condition is growing worse... This\nmeans we'll be losing our magnificent ruler...
BUT!
It just so happens that I have found the missing\nprince! Prince Mallow, that is!
Prince Mallow... Please, sir... Prince?
GET OVER HERE!
Well! It seems that our little prince has a mild\ncase of stage fright.
Excuse me... Ha ha ha...
\KCome ON! Make it snappy!\
\KWhat?! You can't get through? Why am I not surprised.\
Introducing... Prince Mallow!
\PWelcome back, Prince!\Q
\PYou've...grown, Prince!\Q
\PLooking fit, Prince!\Q
Yes? What is it, dear?
What?! You're asking ME to...
Gracious! You're serious, aren't you? Why, I\ndon't know what to say!
Dear me...
I've made my decision. At the request of the\nprince, I agree to become his queen.
\KQueen...\NValentina... \NOoh! \NIt just makes me shiver!\
Well, that's that! Back to your business,\neveryone!
\KHurry it up, will ya?!\
Can you believe it?! What a coincidence!\nThere's a prince with the same name as me!
Don't we have anything better to do than hang\naround here? Come on—let's go and find the\nrest of the Star Pieces!
Poor King Nimbus appears to be a tad under\nthe weather!
I wish the king would get well! But at least\nthe prince is back just in case something...\nawful happens.
Been a while since I saw Prince Mallow. He's...\nchanged, but yes, I do believe that's him.
Was Prince Mallow that huge?! Well, she says\nit's him, so it must be him!
Hey! Who're you?! You can't just barge in here!
Hey! Who're you?! You can't just barge in here!
Why did Prince Mallow make Valentina his\nqueen? I guess it's because she found him.
You like the guards we have at the entrance\nnow? I don't. Never used to have 'em...
That's Garro the sculptor's place. He used to\nmake all kinds of things for King Nimbus!
But these days, the king isn't calling for much\nnew art, what with him being sick and all...
I wonder why more people from the world down\nunder don't visit us these days? I hope it's\nnothing personal...
I used to work for King Nimbus.
But all of a sudden one day, Valentina told me\nI was fired!
I just don't get it...he NEEDS help. He's sick!
I'm watching that volcano over there. What?\nStar...Pieces? Hmm... Never heard of 'em.
I used to work in the castle.\N You should see the\nway she hits the poor prince!
What a horrible life he must live!
We used to be able to walk through the castle\nfreely, but I guess we shouldn't disturb the\nking now.
Have you seen the volcano?\n\RSure have.\nNot yet.\S
They say you can get there by way of the\nhot springs.
The volcano's to the east. Sure wish I could take\na dip in the springs...
I hope to serve the king again soon!
King Nimbus loves statues and birds. He has\nscads of 'em in the castle.
Do you know about the royal bus?\n\RYes.\nNo!\S
When the king recovers, I'll let you see it.\nYou see, I'm the bus-maintenance man.
It's a regal vehicle, used only by the king. It's\nparked now, due to the fact that he's ill...
Prince Mallow, as I remember him, used to be so\nsmall, so timid... Now just look at him!
Welcome! Come on in! So you want to take a\nrest? I'm sure that's why you're here.
It'll be 30 coins a night.\n\ROK, I'll take a break.\nI'll pass.\S
Seems like you don't have enough money.\nCome back again.
Let me guess...you want to use this Dream\nCushion to rest, right? That'll be 30 more coins.
\RI'll try anything once!\nLooks pretty weird...\S
Hey, wait a sec. You don't have enough money,\nso I can't let you use the cushion.
Good dreams are fun entertainment!
(Mario! Good luck!)
Geno, come on—you can do it!
We're counting on you, Mario!
Boing, boing, boing! I'm trying really hard, so\nMario, you have to try hard too!
I'm with you all the way!
Ya! \NYa!
Mario... I've kept this a secret until now, but...\nI'm really a...a...

Mario!
Are you all right?
You were kicking up a sweat...
Here, drink this, and blow those bad guys away.
\PGot a \!!\Q
I guess this is goodbye.
Please come back again!
Morning! Did you have pleasant dreams?\nThat's odd...\N It smells like pepper in here!\nProbably just my imagination.
Morning! Did you have pleasant dreams?\nIt looked like you had nightmares. Is\neverything OK?
Morning! Did you have pleasant dreams?\nWhen you hear laughter, you know it's a\ngood dream!
Say, you have that "I'm looking for something"\nlook in your eyes. What can I do for you?
Hi. I'm the sculptor, Garro. I used to make a lot\nof statues of King Nimbus.
But now, all I get are orders for sculptures\nof Valentina.
Hey, look! It's me!
Oh, you mean that? That's King Nimbus when he\nwas...a...young lad.
\POh!\N Er...\N Huh?\Q
What the?! Who ARE you?!
Hello. My name is Mallow.
And this is my friend Mario.
Mallow... \NSo it is you, my boy! It's been so long.
WHAT?! I'm... I'm really a...prince?!
Yes, indeed! I understand. So! You were raised\nby the Frog Sage!
There's no question about it! You are, without\na doubt, Prince Mallow.
Mario! Look at me! I'm a prince!
I knew Valentina was up to something! I just\ndidn't know what.
That must mean that the king isn't really\ngravely ill!
Then let's go inside the castle and save my\nmother and father!
Hey! Who're you?! You can't just barge in here!
Wait! I have an excellent idea. Come over here...
Are you ready?\n\RYes.\nNo, not yet. Hang on.\S
All right, stand over here.
Hold still, OK?
THERE!
Hey, don't move!
You're going to be a statue for a while, OK?
Let's get going now.
OK, just say when.
I'm delivering Valentina's latest order to her.
You may enter.
\PHalt! Who goes there?\Q
Hey, this doesn't look like Valentina at all!
Oh?!
That's because this is a statue of Valentina's\nnephew, Mar— Mariotta! OK?!
Uh...\ƘOK. Proceed.
Why are you back?! Come on! Put a little effort\ninto it, OK? Good luck!
\PHot Springs\Q
My, you've become a splendid young prince!
Phew, that was close... Didn't think we could\nget through that one. There is no such person\nnamed Mariotta. Ha!
\POhohoho!\Q
Oh! Now THIS is lovely! My beauty simply shines\nforth like the sun!
Only you can make something THIS stunning!
Thank you, Your Majesty. I'll be on my way now...
Halt!
What, may I ask, is THIS ugly thing?
That's my latest masterpiece. I... I created it just\nfor you... It's called...
\P"In Search of Lost Brother."\Q
Observe...the thick mustache... With it, I depict\nhis kind feelings for his younger brother.
And the sideburns...conveying his strength\nof heart.
And the legs...well defined...strong. Legs that\ncan leap any distance in a single bound.
Is it to your liking?
Hmmm...
I consider myself something of an art buff!\nAnd I've got to say...\<this is spectacular!
Garro...only you could have created sculptures\nwith such gentle beauty and...raw power!
Thank you, Your Majesty. I'll be on my way now...
...SPECTACULAR!
Dodo! DODO! Don't just sit there like a roast!\nHurry and carry these in!
DODO!
Step on it!
\PDODO!\Q
Did you display the statues properly?
Fine! Now polish them to a fine luster and make\nthem a tribute to my beauty!
Pay attention to me! Hurry up, and DON'T let me\ncatch you dozing again.
Uh-oh... Dodo's in a pretty bad mood.
Keep up your statue disguise, and jump to avoid\ngetting pecked.
Get ready, because he's coming this way!
What? The statue was "ticklish"? Is that what\nyou said?
If you try stalling just one more time, I'm gonna\nhave your feathers plucked for my pillow.\nNow scat!
STOP BOTHERING ME! If you're so worried,\nwhy don't you go give it a good peck!
\PI'm absolutely exhausted!\Q
I hate being a guard! Valentina only gives us the\nmost boring jobs to do!
But I guess this beats Dodo's job.
Dodo has to polish Valentina's statues every\nsingle day!
Ha! Here's how I'd do it.
Hey, tell me something. Do statues...move?
No. Statues don't move.
Then...explain...THIS!
\PIt's...one of those high-tech...er...lifelike...\nrealistic ones. Let's get outta here.\Q
\PHey, wait a minute! It's locked.\Q
Did you know that there are hot springs\naround here?
\RYep.\nNope!\S
Aww, you're no fun. I wanted to be the first to\ntell you that!
We get special hot water from Barrel Volcano.\nIt helps cure all kinds of ailments.
But only royalty gets to bathe in it.
I used to be a guard here, until Valentina\nsnatched away all my keys...and gave me\nthe boot.
Guess I won't be needing this master key\nanymore. Would you like it?
\RSure!\nNo, thanks.\S
All right, here you go! Just don't tell me what\nyou're gonna do with it, OK?
\PGot \!!\Q
Oh really? You sure? What a shame...this\nprecious key opens the middle room, you know.
So...you don't want it, huh?
\PWait! Don't say that!\Q
To be honest, we really, REALLY need it!
Oh, yeah?
But he said you didn't need it.
Oh, I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse him, he...\nhe's a little shaken up right now.
Oh... OK... I guess...
All right, here you go! Just don't tell me what\nyou're gonna do with it, OK?
Thank you! We owe you one!
You need a key to open the back door of the\nmiddle room... But, of course, Valentina took it.
Go on—take this...
\PGot a \!!\Q
Valentina told me to wait in this room. I'm hoping\nshe'll give me a job soon...
A dip in the hot springs would perk up the king\nin a jiffy!
Hey! Did you know?! Valentina's got a huge egg\nin the middle room.
It spits out eggs from time to time, and\nsometimes when you shield yourself, the\neggs'll ricochet off of you.
♪La \Ndee \Ndah...♪ \NHere ya go, big eggie! I'll give\nya plenty of nutrients so you'll grow up to be big\nand strong!
Oh, \Noh, \Noh... \NMario's already here. He's a fast\none, he is...
Oh, oh, oh... It won't open. It's locked!
Hahahaha.
\PIt's locked.\Q
I'm so...lonely. Will you play with me?
\RSure.\nNot now.\S
Thanks!
Oh... If you had played with me, I was going to\ngive you the key to the next room.
Hello! \L
I'm Birdo.
Tee-hee! Ouch, you're hurting me!
Now it's my turn!
Get it while it's hot!
Oh, I'm never gonna let ya go.
You're just too...CUTE!
\PIt's locked.\Q
Don't forget about me!
King Nimbus is resting in bed. \N\nAbsolutely NO RUNNING in the halls.\N\n\-Queen Valentina\
Mario!
This can only mean that my mom and dad\nare here!
Hey, wait a sec...
It won't open... It's locked.
\PLeave it to me!\Q
Looks like it's up to me to get us out of yet\nanother jam. Feast your eyes on this show of\nbrains...and brawn!
\PSTAND BACK!\Q
WAIT! Wait a minute!
If my dad's really bedridden, we shouldn't make\nso much noise. We need another plan...
I guess we should find Valentina and force the\ntruth out of her!
But what about the door?
Listen, you! Never, EVER talk to the leader of\nBowser's Minions like that! Ooh, I hate that! I'll\nignore it this time...but don't let it happen again!
\PQueen Valentina...\Q
\PQueen Valentina...\Q
\PThis is locked too...\Q
Mario!
Look! There's a note. Let's read it.
King Nimbus is resting in bed.\N\nAbsolutely NO RUNNING in the halls.\N\n\-Queen Valentina\
\PQueen Valentina...\Q
That Mario creature who beat up Smilax is here.
Mario?! What...does a "Mario" look like?
Well...it has a bushy mustache, long sideburns,\nand, uh, a pair of...mean-looking legs!
Hmmm... I have the feeling I've seen this\n"Mario" before.
Wait! Yes! It was that statue that Garro\njust delivered!
What, what, what are we gonna do? What are we\ngonna DO, Valentina?!
Well, we certainly aren't going to listen to your\npointless chatter.
Frankly speaking, I'm not going to worry. Without\nthis key, the king can't go anywhere!
\PHush...\Q
\PI SAID SHUT UP ALREADY!\Q
What the?! \<That...that isn't a statue!\nThat's Mario!
Valentina! Hand over the key, NOW!
\PAck!\Q
How utterly rude! And who in blazes are\nyou, anyway?!
Me? I'm the REAL prince, that's who!
Brat! And how dare you listen in on a private\nconversation!
Private? Private?! Everyone in a 10-mile radius\ncould hear you!
Harrumph! If you're going to be this rude...
I'm simply going to leave.
\PSo long...chumps!\Q
Eh? Hey! Valentina ran away...
\PI shall fly the coop too...\Q
Uh... I... I think we kind of missed the boat here...
So...we'd better get moving too! C'mon, \Nlet's\nget 'em!
\PMario!\Q
Wrong way, Mario! She went through THAT door!
\PMario!\Q
Helloooo, is anybody home? I just said she went\nthrough THAT door, over there!
\PMario!\Q
You must not care about my parents... You're so\nmean, Mario.
What? You saw a statue move? Don't\nbe ridiculous.
You're just stalling so you won't have to\npolish them!
Right now, Prince Mallow is bathing in the hot\nsprings. It must be so relaxing.
\PQueen Valentina!\Q
Queen Valentina, is the king showing any\nimprovement?
And how is his wife, the old queen?
And Prince Mallow? Is he well?
\PKnow what I think? I think...\Q
\PNot only that, but...\Q
\PAnd furthermore...\Q
\PAh, but then...\Q
\PArggghh!\Q
Pipe down! All of you!
I have better things to do than to listen to your\nhalf-wit opinions!
And look! While I've been wasting my time\nlistening to your endless chatter...
\PMario has managed to find me!\Q
Dodo! \NDODO!\N
Ooh! That bird has a permanent brain cramp!
Dodo! Do you hear me?! Get over here NOW!\nI need some help...entertaining Mario!
So MOVE IT! Come here NOW!
Dodo! DODO! Come here this minute!
Don't just sit there. HELP ME!
Dodo?! How could you lose already?
Well, come on! Get over here!
I don't believe this!
The show's over, folks! Dodo! Let's get\noutta here!
Well, everyone... Until we meet again!
Mwahahahaha...
Great... They're gone.
Hurry! Let's go after her! I KNOW she has\nthe key!
\PAck!\Q
Owwww...\N
\PHuh?! Mario! Look!\Q
Mom... Dad... I'd like you to meet Mario...
and my other travel companions!
I say! How can we ever thank you enough?\nI'm Mallow's father...King Nimbus.
Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for looking\nafter my dear child.
Allow me to introduce everyone!
This...is Princess Peach from the Mushroom\nKingdom...
Ah! I've heard so much about you! May I...\nhave your autograph?
Don't embarrass Junior, dear!
Oh! Never mind...
And who is this gentleman here?
THIS...is Mario! He helped me from the start!
You don't mean...THE Mario?! Jumping Mario?!\nAutograph, please!
That's quite enough, dear...
OK, OK! Then...how about showing me just a\nlittle jump? A tiny hop will do!
Oh! Fantastic!
This is Bowser, leader of Bowser's Minions.
Oh! Another famous person! This is just too\nmuch! I MUST have your autograph!
No? Not even a little scribble? OK, OK...
And this is Geno, who came from the starry sky,\nlike I told you before.
Oh! Yes! That story about the Starway!\nHow awful!
That's...Star Road...
Oh right! Speaking of stars, a little while ago,\na large star fell into the volcano!
Hmm, but the dreaded Czar Dragon inhabits the\nvolcano. It's going to be tough getting a star out\nof there!
Hmmm...perhaps all of you working together\nCOULD handle that beast...
Why, when I was young, I...
Yes, dear. Now, once at the volcano, find Cinder\nToad. He'll be able to help you.
You be careful, everyone!
OK! But we probably won't come back until we\nfind the star!
Son, you're just like me when I was your age.\nI'm proud of you.
If you have any problems, come straight\nback, OK?!
We'll do whatever we can to help.
\PYou're looking especially\nfluffy today, Prince!\Q
\PLong time no see, Prince Mallow!\Q
\PMy, how you've grown, Prince!\Q
\PPrince Mallow, you're such a crybaby!\Q
We're all able to serve the king again.
But we left our houses wide open. Hope\neverything's all right.
The king gave me another job as a guard.
...Prince Mallow!
Thank you so much! We were able to rescue my\nfather with the key you gave us.
Don't mention it...
Besides, it was you who actually rescued him!
Good luck in the future!
You too!
Prince!
Here, this is from me. Please, take it.
\PGot a \!!\Q
I shall continue to work for the king with pride.
Did you know that there are hot springs\naround here?
\RYep.\nNope.\S
Aww, you're no fun. I wanted to be the first to\ntell you that!
We get special hot water from Barrel Volcano.\nIt helps cure all kinds of ailments.
But only royalty gets to bathe in it.
The king's happier than ever after being reunited\nwith Mallow.
It reminds me of when he was young, soaring\nacross the sky in the royal bus...
Came to see the king's statue collection. I tell\nyou, it's remarkable!
This statue... It...it seems so...unworldly!
What happened to Valentina?
She must have landed near the sky after she\nflew the coop...
Before Valentina came, fireworks lit up the sky\nevery night.
Some guy in Moleville would make the fireworks.\N\nI wonder if we'll ever get to see them again...
We can finally walk around the castle and the\ntown freely.
People from down under will probably come too.\nThat girl by the inn'll tell you who's here.
It's a marvelous statue, isn't it?
I bet that's one of the Star Pieces!
Before you go to the volcano, you ought to take\na dip in our hot springs out back. They're the\npride of Nimbus Land!
Why, I bet you'd enjoy the hot springs, just as I\ndid as a boy. You can reach them through the\ndoor back there.
So the king WAS all right! I'm so happy for him.
I'm so relieved the king wasn't ill... And hurrah\nfor our prince!
This time, the prince is for real, right?
I KNEW IT! I knew the prince couldn't be THAT\nenormous! Three cheers for the real prince!
Oh yeah! I saw Valentina going toward the\nbuilding to the south...
I wonder why?
The king must be overjoyed, having Prince\nMallow back.
We can finally go in the castle. The king seems\njust fine!
Garro's busy making statues of King Nimbus.\nHe seems very happy!
People have been visiting us from the world\ndown under. Even Croco came.
Oh, \Noh...\N Busted... \NWhat to do, what to do?
I'll give you this fertilizer if you let me go...OK?
\PGot \!!\Q
Now that we can go into the castle again, I think\nI'll go check out some statues.
Have you seen the volcano? \n\RSure have!\nNot yet.\S
They say you can get there by way of the\nhot springs.
The volcano's to the east. Sure wish I could take\na dip in the springs...
Say, hey! We meet again!
Dis here land is RICH! It's got tons of loot,\nand I want it all!
But hey, I'm not sweatin'! This device'll tell me\nwhere the treasures are hidden!
The rest of 'em are mine! All MINE! Adios, fools!
\PFound an \!! If you equip it, it'll\ntell you the locations of Hidden Treasures.\Q
Prince Mallow! That was splendid work! You are\nevery bit a prince!
If it weren't for you, Garro, we'd never have\npulled it off! We definitely owe you one!
Thanks, Mallow.
\KI'm really glad everything worked out...\
Mallow, you are indeed a true prince!
The bus is undergoing repairs.
Welcome! Come on in! So you want to take a\nrest? I'm sure that's why you're here.
It'll be 30 coins a night.\n\ROK, I'll take a break.\nI'll pass.\S
Seems like you don't have enough money.\nCome back again.
Let me guess...you want to use this Dream\nCushion to rest, right? That'll be 30 more coins.
\RI'll try anything once!\nLooks pretty weird...\S
Hey, wait a sec. You don't have enough money,\nso I can't let you use the cushion.
Good dreams are fun entertainment!
(Mario! Good luck!)
Geno, come on—you can do it!
We're counting on you, Mario!
Boing, boing, boing! I'm trying really hard, so\nMario, you have to try hard too!
I'm with you all the way!
Ya! \NYa!
Mario... I've kept this a secret until now, but...\nI'm really a...a...
\PA MONSTER!\Q
Mario!
Are you all right?
You were kicking up a sweat...
Here, drink this and blow those bad guys away.
\PGot a \!!\Q
I guess this is goodbye.
Please come back again!
Morning! Did you have pleasant dreams?\nThat's odd...\N It smells like pepper in here!\nProbably just my imagination.
Morning! Did you have pleasant dreams?\nIt looked like you had nightmares. Is\neverything OK?
Morning! Did you have pleasant dreams?\nWhen you hear laughter, you know it's a\ngood dream!
Say, you have that "I'm looking for something"\nlook in your eyes. What can I do for you?
Up ahead are the hot springs. But only royalty\nis allowed...
Hey! You're the REAL prince!
Sorry about the misunderstanding before...\nThere's no way that giant bird could have\nbeen a prince, huh?
No big deal. Anyway, do you think you could let\nus through here?
Of course!
Go right ahead. Please, enjoy yourselves.
But be careful not to fall into the volcano.
Please, enjoy yourselves. But be careful not to\nfall into the volcano.
\PDANGER!\nBeyond this edge is the volcano.\Q
Star Piece? Now that you mention it, I did see\na star fall into that volcano over there.
Hey there! Whew...so those footsteps were you!\nFor a minute, I thought I was hearing things!
I'm Cinder Toad... This place is a regular inferno!\nCome on, step inside!
Thanks for stopping by. You can always come\nback, you know.
Welcome to the item shop!
Welcome to the inn! Thirty coins will get you\na room.
\ROK.\nNo, thanks.\S
You don't have enough coins. Come back when\nyou get more.
You're staying? Great! I'll get everything ready\nfor you.
Morning! Now wasn't that a cushy bed?
You can't stay? Oh, all right...
Welcome to the armor shop!
Thanks for stopping by. You can always come\nback, you know.
We got the star!
We're amazing!
We're unbeatable!
We're gorgeous!
You'd better leave now, chumps!
Hey, Red! Look down there! That's gotta be the\nugliest mustache I've ever seen!
Eww! Gross!
That guy's worse-looking than that clod Mario!
That IS Mario, you idiot!
Listen, everyone! We gotta get this star to the\nBlade immediately. We'll deal with Mario later!
Hey, Red! Careful with this! You're all thumbs!
Where's the Blade?
He'll be here!
Are you sure?!
Relax, people!
Mario's HERE!
He's too late!
Where's the Blade?!
Shuddap, already!
FINALLY!
We fight for evil!
We live for disorder!
We like what we do!
We struggle for chaos!
We are...
the AXEM RANGERS!
This Star Piece gives people hope!
It needs to be destroyed!
Ooh, my head is spinning!
Yo, Red!
What?
I've got a headache.
I'm...hungry!
My makeup's running!
I broke my shades!
You're totally out of shape!
Chew on your tongue!
Then change brands!
Serves ya right!
Enough! Now I'm angry!
Time to finish this!
Formation—ho!
Here we GO!
This isn't possible! We are...invincible!
Can this be happening to the Axem Rangers?
\PSix Star Pieces have finally\nbeen collected. Where could\nthat last Star Piece be?\Q
Uwaaaaaah!
The entrance to Monstro Town is underground.\nFollow the whirls in the desert.
Eh?! That delicious smell! You have some\nCricket Jam, yes?
May I have some?\n\RSure!\nNope.\S
Mmm, this is wonderful! Thank you, Mario.\nYou've made an old man happy.
Here's a little allowance for being so good to me.
My wish has come true.
Sure, torture an old man!
I JUST found out that there's a kingdom in the\nclouds. Go and explore it, my children.
Grandpa! We found my real home! It's way up in\nthe clouds.
Mallow! You're a prince?! I never would\nhave guessed!
And now you're helping to save the world?\nYou've come a long way, child.
Although you've found your family, this\nadventure isn't over yet!
Yep. I'm not giving up!
You've got to defeat Valentina, and save\nNimbus Land.
Ah! Now the people of Nimbus Land can rejoice.
So! I hear the next Star Piece is inside a volcano.
I also heard that Booster got himself another\nbride from the sky.
So...only Bowser's Keep remains.
The citizens of Nimbus Land will tell you how to\nget there.
That's all the advice I have.
You've done well. All that's left to do is to\ndefeat Smithy.
Save this world, and bring this quest to a\nhappy end!
Go up those steps, and you'll find the stop for\nthe royal bus. It's pretty cool.
I just saw a mushroom person. You'll find him at\nthe inn.
Hmm... Just can't seem to find the casino. I'm\nsooo tired! I've been walking around all day!
\PHey, he's holding a leaflet.\nWanna read it?\Q
\RYeah, sure.\nNo.\S
\PCome to Grate Guy Casino!\nThree jumps and a Bright Card\nwill get you in!\Q
\PSorry, but no Chain Chomps allowed.\Q
\PCasino Manager, Grate Guy\Q
Three jumps, a Bright Card, and no...Chain\nChomps? What IS this?
Oh! I'm sooo tired... Leave me alone.
The bus has finally been repaired. We can start\noperating again.
Prince Mallow!
We want to go to Bowser's Keep. Could you give\nus a lift, please?
I've heard the story from King Nimbus. You'll be\nthere in no time!
Here it comes, here it comes!
So, how's the engine running?
Oh, it's purring like a kitten!
Could you take Prince Mallow to the entrance of\nBowser's Keep?
Of course! Can't wait to get this thing running\nagain! Come, Prince—hop on board.
All aboard!
\PWe're off!\Q
Ride the royal bus to Bowser's Keep?\n\RYou bet!\nMaybe another time.\S
The bus'll be arriving shortly.
All aboard!
\PWe're off!\Q
Feel free to ride again.
Mom! Dad!
Were you able to find the star, dear?
Yeah. The Axem Rangers took it away from us,\nbut...we got it back again!
That's wonderful! Now the Star— Uh— Starway\ncan be repaired, right?
I guess not. You're...still missing a piece,\nI take it.
The last star...
Wait! The only place left to look is in\nBowser's Keep!
Yeah, we know. But...there's no way to get in.\nBelieve me, we've tried, but...
Yes, yes. Even Mario can't jump THAT far.
All right! I'll let you use the...
That's it, dear!
You should use the royal bus!
Yes, Mallow, the time has come for you to take\nthe bus!
Why, when I was your age...
Really?! Are you sure it's all right?
Of course, dear.\N
I'll order the repair man to have it fixed by the\ntime you leave.
You simply have to help Mario and the others\nget that last star!
You bet, Mom!
Come on, Mario—let's go!
Hurry and get the Star, uh...Star...Lane...fixed for\ngood! Best of luck, all!
Hurry and get the Star, uh...Star...Street...fixed\nfor good! Best of luck, all!
Hurry and get the Star, uh...Star...Strip...fixed for\ngood! Best of luck, all!
Please... Promise me you'll make everyone's\ndreams come true once again!
Ahhh... The scent of boiling lava...
It's so nice to be home!
Smithy's gonna pay for stealing my splendid\ncastle from me!
Hey, Mario. Did ya remember to use the\nsave point?
There's plenty of danger up ahead, so it's best\nto save now!
You need anything?
I've got some items to sell.
\RYeah.\nNo, thanks.\S
Of the six doors...
Two open onto action courses! You can handle\na lot of action, right?
Two others will lead you to battle courses.\nYou can fight, right?!
The last two open onto puzzle courses. No\nsweat for a great puzzle-solver like you, right?!
Once you choose a course, there's no\nturning back!
The only way to know what's behind a door is to\nwalk through it!
You must pass four of the six courses to\nmove ahead.
Heh...I'm the Quiz Master, but you can call me\nDr. T! You into coin collecting? Heh...
Want instructions?\n\RYes!\nYou take me for a fool?\S
There're 21 coins in this box...
We'll take turns removing them. The one who\ntakes the last coin is the loser! Heh...
You can grab four at once. If you want to grab\nonly one or two, press \o where you want to\nstop. Got it?
Heh...you got the last coin... YOU LOSE!
Heh...you win. Nothing to it, right?
The topic, you ask? Magic Buttons. Heh...
Want instructions?\n\RYep!\nNope.\S
Heh... Step on one button, and you'll reverse the\nsurrounding buttons.
So, ON becomes OFF...and OFF becomes ON!\nGet it?
Let's see if you can set them all to ON! Can you\ndo it?
Heh...congrats! Plain sailing, eh?!
Now, the topic is Ball Solitaire. Heh...
Want instructions?\n\RYeah.\nNope.\S
Heh! When you kick a ball, it'll leapfrog an\nadjacent ball, which will then disappear.
Keep making balls disappear until one remains!\nYou can't kick a ball into a space occupied by\nanother ball.
And the ball you kick must always leapfrog\nanother ball. Got it?!
Heh...too bad. Too bad...heh.
Heh...wow. Simple as ABC, eh?!
Hey, hey, HEY! It's me, the Quiz Master! And...\nit's QUIZ TIME!
Need an explanation?\n\RYeah.\nForget it, I already know!\S
I'll give you twelve—count 'em, TWELVE—\nquestions.
If you're right, the block you're standing on\nwill move up one. But if you blow it, you go\ndown two.
You have five seconds... If you can't answer, you\nmove down one.
Reach the eighth step within the 12 questions,\nand you've won. Got it?!

Give ya ten seconds—TEN! Tell me the number\nof barrels in the room!
Heh heh... Close your eyes for a sec.
Heh heh... You ready?

Now we'll see if you can REALLY count. You've\ngot 20 seconds... Ready?

Ooh, too bad...
Now for something completely different. Heh...
Boo, Goo, Bones, and Kipp competed in\na triathlon.
The triathlon included swimming, cycling, and\na marathon.
It's up to you to guess which place each person\ncame in. So listen well to what they have to say!
Well?\n\RHa! Call ME the master!\nI'm still...working on it.\S

I outdid \m both on my bike and in the\nfinal rankings!
I fell into fourth place during the bike race, but\nfinally ended up in the same place as I did in the\nswimming event.
I placed the same in the swimming and cycling\nevents, but two others beat me in the marathon.
I came in third for swimming, and never did\nbetter in the events after that...

This is...Smithy's castle!
No trespassers allowed.
Wizakoopa!
Huh? Where am I? Bowser, hello! How have\nyou been?
I, uh, made it back here somehow, but it seems\nlike I've been brainwashed or something.
I can't seem to remember anything. Have I done\nsomething...wrong?
Uh, don't worry about it. Let's just put it\nbehind us.
It's great running into a loyal minion like you.
I'm glad! It looks like you've got some tough new\nminions now.
But my magic can still help you.
Watch this! \Uget \watchoo \peifore!
This magic treasure box will never run out\nof coins.
Just keep on hitting it.
I'll be here if you need me.
Come by whenever you need to rejuvenate your\nHP and magic.
You've come to the right person!
You still hanging around? Oh, you want more\nitems, huh? Since I'm in a good mood...
Just remember...
I can't always be coming to your rescue,\nyou know.
If there's anything more you need, best to buy\nit now.
See ya...pal.
\PHahahahaha!\Q
Ahhhhh... So you are the notorious Mario!
I'm impressed you made it this far. I didn't think\nyou could.
Oh! Feisty little fellow, aren't you? But this is\nthe end of the line.
Now you've got to deal with me! EN GARDE!
Argh! This is absurd!
I can't be defeated by THEM!
I won't let this happen! I won't fall in battle...
*gasp* *cough* *hack*
H...having an attack... *gasp*
I don't need your sympathy!
I am a soldier... I am prepared to...go...
Take a dive, Shyndelier!
Yeoouuch!
See ya later, kids!
Boomer! Oh, poor Boomer!
But not to worry. A little fall isn't gonna\nhurt you!
All right, Mario! I'll lead you to the top!
We must hurry to the appointed place!
Hang on tight!
And away we go!
You're getting the hang of it!
Increasing speed!
Next stop, the top floor!
Please fasten your seat belts, and...
Wait a sec!
There ARE no seat belts!
How many barrels are there?\n\R\f.\n\g.\n\h.\S

Wizakoopa! So this is where you went off to!
There are six doors. Need an explanation?
Do you know where this leads to?
It looks like Exor's the contact between the\ntwo worlds.
In other words...
If we follow this road, we'll find Smithy.
\ÐSo...what's keeping us?
Hang on!
Hey! I only joined so that I could get my\ncastle back.
I'm not going to be dragged along on this\nstupid hunt.
\ÖI'm going to gather my minions and rebuild\nmy castle.
And you, Mario! As an official member of\nBowser's Minions, it's your duty to help with\nthe repairs!
Bowser, you're completely missing the point.
Gwaa?! I oughta rip your stuffing out!
No, think about it, Bowser. Exor connects the\ntwo worlds, right?
Even though we defeated Exor...there will be\nother weapon beasts that come through\nthat connection.
Your castle is at the entrance point to your\nworld. In short...the weapons will all pass\nthrough your castle!
Is that what you want?
Um...\Nwell...\N
More weapon things...\Ncoming to take over my\ncastle?\N What about my...\NPRIVACY?
Yikes...\N This isn't good at all...\N In fact, \Nthis stinks!
But I can't just be pals with these nincompoops.\nI've got an image to keep up.
I've got it!
No one insults Bowser's Minions and gets away\nwith it.
\čI've got a bone to pick with this Smithy guy!
Come on, Mario! Let's go teach him a lesson\nright now, together!
\KI'm so sly!\
It looks like we're together on this one. Let's go!
\PIt's Mario!\Q
\PIt's Mario!\Q
\PHow did he get here?!\Q
\PWe better do something!\Q
Mwee-hee-hee! Behold! They've taken\nthe bait!
Hee-hee-hee!
I guess I can spare a few minutes! Maybe\nthey'd like to...play!
This is tougher than I thought! I don't like\nwhere this is going...
Put your dukes up!
Phew! What weaklings! How shameful if they\nwere to defeat me!
I'll clobber you!
Production is on schedule?
This, despite the fact that Claymorton, Bowyer,\nSpeardovich, and the Axem Rangers were\ndefeated.
At this rate, Smithy will have a new army in\nno time!
A...new army?
You can't be making more weapons! Haven't you\ncaused enough trouble already?
Oh yeah?! Who are you?
This is THE Mario!
Give up now while you still have a chance!
Shut down production now, or he'll...STOMP ya!
What did you say, you little puffball? Mad Mallet!\nTrash 'em!
All right, let's see whatcha got!
Ha! Hope you learned your lesson!
We're almost there, Mario. Come on!
What do you suppose this switch does? Hmm...
...\NNothing's happening.
Huh? What's with the funny face, Mario?\ŕ
\ŖOh, I know—you're trying to make me look, aren't\nyou? I'm not going to fall for that one!
Ack! Help me, Mario!
Boy, that was scary! I guess the green switch\ncontrols the crane.
\PMario!\Q
*pant* *gasp* Phew, I...finally made it up here...
Let me help you guys out!
P-Princess!
I'm sorry I snuck out without telling you or\nthe chancellor.
I just wanted things to get back to normal.\nI wanted to do my part to help...
Princess...
Yes! That's it!
Any job that lets me help both Mario and the\nprincess is worthwhile!
But...what can you do to help?
Well, I carried all I could! Now, what could\nyou use?
This is for you.
\PGot \!!\Q
Thank you, Toad.
We're almost there! Come on! Let's show 'em!
Well, I carried all I could! Now, what could\nyou use?
We're almost there! Come on! Let's show 'em!
Here's the report!
Sir! Drill Bit will be finished on time.
We're ahead of schedule!
We'll make Smithy proud!
Good work, everyone. The harder we work,\nthe stronger Smithy will become!
The weapons we manufacture here will be...
\PJust think of it...\Q
When Smithy takes over Mario's world, we can\ndo anything we want!
Nya ha ha.\O\n\PGwah ha ha...\Q\O\n\Heh heh heh...\
Not so fast!
You sure are a cocky bunch!
I rule this world! Don't you forget it!
It's Mario! The Claymorton and Speardovich\nclones didn't stop him?
No, NO! Leave Mario outta this. I'm the one you\nneed to worry about, not him!
Mario, you're about to make the longest jump\nof your life!
Y...you're ignoring me!
Um...well...
Like the moon over\N\nthe day, my genius and brawn\N\nare lost on these fools.\N            -Haiku
Um...\Nwell...\N
You there! Are you the one in charge here?
Do you know what your weapons have been\ndoing to our world?
Stop this nonsense at once!
I'm afraid that isn't possible.
Any dissent against Smithy will be dealt with by\nimmediate meltdown.
M-meltdown?
You can't scare me. I've got Mario by my side!
Dissenters will be eliminated! Production\nwill continue.
That was scary!
But we can't run away now. We've got to kick\nthese lowlifes out of our world.
Mario! I'm surprised to see you here.
But this is the end of the line for you.
This is the closest you'll ever get to Smithy, so\nsavor the moment.
Harrumph! You'll be fodder for my incredible\ninvention, the Gunyolk!
Hm... \NThe production line hasn't halted.
Look, Mario—this is where the weapons\ncome from.
This must be where Smithy makes his weapons.
To find the last Star Piece and stop the factory,\nwe've got to defeat him first.
Mario... There's no turning back now.\nAre you ready?
Our quest is almost over.
And when the time comes...
Come on! Let's get this show on the road.
Hey!
There's the last Star Piece!
Huh?
Already finished your tour of the factory, huh?!\nAll right then! How about a little demonstration?
Yo, Smithy!
Stop making those things, and hand over the\nStar Piece—now!
Huh? Gufaw haw haw!
So you're Mario?! Looks like we're gonna have\na little dispute over the star.
Just hand it over, and GET OUTTA MY CASTLE!
My, my! We're a little touchy today, aren't we?
You know, I'm actually growing rather fond of\nthis place...
Please! Don't make us go through any more!\nJust give us the star...NOW!
Harrumph! Better yet...
Why don't YOU give me YOUR stars. Why, then\nI could easily conquer this world!
Then we could get rid of all wishes, and create\na world filled with...WEAPONS!
\POver here, NOW!\Q
\PI'll crush you ALL!\Q
NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Calm down, Smithy! Your head looks like\na geyser!
Don't get so worked up! Think of your\nblood pressure!
We just built this yesterday, and the\nfoundation's very weak.
So...STOP SHAKING THE FLOOR!
How utterly annoying!
Huh?! What the?!
How in the heck?!
NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Uwoooooooo...
I'm burning...seething... Never have I been\nso wronged...
It is time...
I will show you my real form... I will show you\nmy true power...
I will teach you respect... And I shall have\nmy revenge...
RAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Guooooooo!
Come on, you puny ants!
Grraaaaagghh!
My b-body...and head...are burning!
It's not...possible!
I don't believe it!
Nooooo!
I'm...finished...done for!
Youuu! You meddlers!
Grrraaaaagh... Noooooo!
Come on, Mario!
Send the last one way up high!
Thank you, everyone!
The Star Road is back to normal! \And...\
Mario! You're awake!
Glad I caught you before you went off to the\nfactory. I got you this present!
\PGot a \!!\Q
Take a night to rest up right in the Marrymore\nHotel suite before the last push.
That's all I had for you. Hope you enjoy your\nstay in the suite!
You looked like you were fast asleep. You didn't\ndream about defeating Smithy, did you?
Hello. I see you have a Stay Voucher.
You're going to love our hotel's fine suite!
The bellhop will show you to your room. Please\nenjoy your stay.
I saw a bright light through the window during\nthe night.
I believe it came from Star Hill. Why don't we go\nfind out what might have caused it?
Oh my...another big cake.
Looks tasty, huh? I love sweets!
I hope not. Hmm...don't these Tortes look tired?
Ve haf vorked night und day to make ze most\ndelicious cake ever!
You zhere! Vhy ze silent treatment? Haf you\nno pride in your vork?!
Sorry. I know you don't want to hear this. But the\ncake is moving again.
What's wrong? Come on—say something!
Zo sorry. Is true. Zinscere apologies.
Ve must ask zat you batter ze cake into\nsubmission, just like ze last time!
Ve must ask zat you batter ze cake into\nsubmission!
Vay to put ze cake in its place!
Yeah, good work! We all thought you should\nhave this as thanks.
\PGot an \!!\Q
Why, thank you! And may you have better luck\nwith any cakes you bake in the future.
We do our best!
Only we would have to fight a cake not once\nbut twice.
I never did get to taste it. I wish I could have\ntried even a little piece...
Hee-hee! I wondered about that too. Maybe we\ncould get them to deliver one for the castle.
Ve make delicious cakes. Delicious cakes move.\nZo no more delicious! Ve make cakes zat taste\nlike flour ONLY!
*grumble* This is what comes of working\nthrough the night without sleep...
\ę\ĚHang on though... It looks just like that cake\nfrom the wedding. You think it'll attack again?
You are going to stay in the suite at the\nMarrymore Hotel, right? I'd love to spend\na night there myself.
Mario, is it true that the one called Jinx in\nMonstro Town is stronger than you?
Sounds like Belome's up to his old tricks again...
I wonder if that expert bomb maker ever stopped\nmaking bombs.
I think Booster is looking for some company\nagain, Mario.
I think there may be some sort of celebration\ngoing on in Marrymore.
That pirate boss you met is raring to go again.\nA passionate fellow, isn't he?
Mario, do you ever stop by your dojo from time\nto time? It seems to me your students could use\nsome hands-on training.
There may be somewhere in Monstro Town\nwhere it's worth using that Shiny Stone from\nMoleville. Be careful though.
That flat, evil being remains unchecked. Don't\nyou think it might be a good idea to defeat him?
Do you think that flat, evil being has learned\nhis lesson? Wherever did he go, anyway?
Mario! You've proven yourself unstoppable.\nFrom this day forward, it's you who should be\ncalled a sage!
Greetings, Mario Sage.
You finally showed up! Ever since you people\nbeat me, I've been refining my technique.
This time, I'm sure to win. Fame and fortune,\nhere I come!
Mwa ha ha! You think you can beat me and my\nminions? This I'd like to see.
You know it! I was known as a terror on two legs\nlong before you came on the scene!
Urk! You're that famous Bowser? The Chain-\nChomp-slinging one?!
That's fine. I didn't just bring bombs this time.\nI've got an amazing shield to back them up!\nGood luck finding any holes in this defense!
I'm much higher level now! Defeating the\nfamous Bowser and his minions will catapult\nme to unprecedented fame and fortune!
I'm much higher level now! Defeating the\nfamous Bowser and his minions will catapult\nme to unprecedented fame and fortune!
Bowser's Minions are...too strong. I might be\ndoomed to obscurity after all...
At the very least, let me level up your Chain\nChomp, Bowser. That way, I can be remembered\nfor something.
So this is that rascally Chain Chomp, huh?
All right...let's level this puppy up!
All done!
Hey, Punchinello! You're good at this stuff.
I'll do you a special favor and let you put those\nskills to use fixing up my keep.
Yippee! With the famous Bowser asking for my\nhelp, maybe a little fame will rub off on me!
My dream has finally come true! Now I can show\nmy face around home with pride.
Let me know when repairs on the keep start,\nand I'll come running!
Huh? Where's that untamable Chain Chomp\nI'd heard about? I thought you had her.
I never heard of any Chain Chomp like that.
Hmm, maybe she's a captive somewhere. If you\nbring her here, I'll level her up right away.
There's a rascally Chain Chomp somewhere\nout there. If you bring her here, I'll level her up\nfor you.
\PThe Chain Chomp became a \!!\Q
This guy sure gets excited easy. What's so\ngreat about being famous?
Who knows? But he's given up making bombs,\nand that's good enough for me.
Bowser's already famous in his own right.\nWouldn't you agree?
There you have it. Fame and fortune are yours...\nassuming you can win. Shall we find out?
So, whaddaya think of my new pal?
It suits you. The two of you make an\nintimidating pair.
Mwa ha ha! Who'd dare to mess with the great\nBowser and his most powerful Chain Chomp?\nNo one—that's who!
Well, well. It's people!
What? Did you make that yourself?
Hm. You must have a skilled touch to build and\nmaintain that all on your own.
That doll's saying words!
This body isn't... Actually, I won't bother getting\ninto it. It's too complicated.
Now it's my turn to ask a question. Are you\ngoing to stick around to play with me and my\nEngine 023? It'll be fun!
\RYou bet.\nNope.\S
Hooray! Then this train is leaving the station!
Then find yourself another playhouse.
Ooh, the people are back. You'll play with me\nand my Engine 023, right?
Ahhhaha! Now THAT was a fun game!
Booster, sir! You forgot to attach that thing to\nyour Engine 023!
Whaaaat?! That explains why I didn't win the\ngame like I was supposed to!
\PGot the \!!\Q
This is...a quality device. I think I'll have some\nfun with this indeed.
I don't have time for your excuses! In fact,\nyou should be leaving now.
Playtime's over, everyone. My train's going back\nto the station for repairs.
Pretty neat toy you've got there, pink lady.
Weird that my eyes are leaking though. I thought\nI was too happy to cry!
Here, take that part I wasn't using. Stick it on\nthat neat doll of yours so you can play more!
Get lost!
Did you notice the new addition to my personal\nrailway? This one's Engine...023!
That doll's saying words!
Yes, well, about this body... In order to search\nfor the Star Pieces, I inhabited a doll belonging\nto a young boy named Gaz, and—
Oh! What a generous gift.
Booster...do you not remember everything that\nhappened the last time you saw us?
Sure! Lots of people showed up at my house,\nand then there was a big fuss for some reason.
Nothing seems to have changed here. Let's keep\nlooking farther in.
I don't recall this star being here before. It must\nbe where that light was coming from!
There seem to be a few others too. Perhaps\nsome new wishes have fallen here? The Frog\nSage might know more.
\PI hope THIS is my big break.\Q
\PI want to join Bowser's Minions.\Q
\PI've got something special to show off.\Q
\PThat doll was something special.\Q
\PI vish someone vould do somezing about\nzis cake.\Q
\PI vish I could make a normal cake.\Q
\PI'm itching for a heated duel!\Q
\PI hope that guy wins his corker of a fight with\nthe Smithy creature!\Q
\PMy throat's all scratchy. Make it stop.\Q
\PI'd like to try eating a frog some day.\Q
\PI want our new master to show us his moves.\Q
\PI wish we had at least one more student.\Q
\PI have returned, having attained even greater\npower. I await the one destined to challenge\nme once again.\Q
\PI await the destined one's return...\Q
\PI want a match with someone who makes me\ntake it seriously.\Q
\PI, the Dark Knight of Vanda, await the one\ndestined to challenge me.\Q
Avast, Mario! I've been waiting to see your mug\naround here again.
Ever since our little duel, I've felt a whirlpool in\nmy heart sucking all the joy away.
This can't go on, matey. Who is Johnny without\na fire in his belly?
So I ask you, would you cross swords with me\none more time?
A tremendous duel, just the two of us! Without\nany items, even!
What do you say?! Let's set this sea to boiling!
\RLet's do it.\nI'll pass.\S
\PPut the allies you want cheering you on in your\nactive party. You'll get their Ally Buff effects.\Q
Good fun! I knew you'd accept, Mario.
Aye... I suppose you do have a corker of a fight\nwith that Smithy creature ahead of you.
Come again if you find your courage. I'll wait as\nlong as it takes.
A grand duel with no mateys or items to get in\nthe way! Let's set this sea to boiling!
Now steel yourself, for here I come!
Harrr! You got me. But never in my years have I\nfought a finer battle. So fierce! So heated!
\PGot an \!!\Q
I found that stone in the lowest depths of\nmy ocean.
It's proper that the victor of our duel should be\nits keeper.
You beat me fair, but it wasn't victory I needed.\nIt was a duel well-fought against a worthy foe!
Take this, and remember the day our duel\nbrought the fire back to my belly.
This guy again? Didn't he take the hint after you\nbeat him up twice?
I really hoped he'd settled down by now.
My throat is scratchy... It's making me\nall grumpy.
He seems real riled up! I think he's scarier than\nthe last time we saw him...
Is that any way for one of my minions to talk?\nGet it together!
You're right! He's tougher than last time, but so\nam I!
We've beat him twice, and we can do it again!\nI'm not letting him push me around!
My throat is scratchy... It's making me\nall grumpy.
I'm taking too many hits... I don't feel so good...
All better. No more scratchy throat.
Time for Belome to say bye-bye!
Looks like Belome spit something up. What is\nthis thing?
\PFound a \!!\Q
Oh... This stick might have been my grandpa's!
What? How can you tell?
Because he once told me that he lost it around\nhere somewhere.
Well...that makes it yours, right?
Grandpa... I'll take this stick you left behind and\nput it to good use!
You're the spell-slinger of the team, so if anyone\ncan use that thing, it's you!
All right—now!
No, no! Don't strike with your arms—strike with\nyour whole body!
I think I'll watch the match between you and my\nsensei from a safe place.
Master Mario! We are training hard to master\nmoves involving cooperation from one's allies.
It's harder than we thought to stay in sync in the\nheat of combat. We can't seem to manage it no\nmatter how hard we train.
I'd appreciate if you could show us your Triple\nMoves as an example of how such cooperation\nis supposed to work.
\RI'd be happy to!\nNot right now.\S
Then let us spar!
My apologies for imposing on you when you\nhave so much on your plate. We will continue\nto train hard on our own.
Master! Please demonstrate your Triple Moves\nto us as an example of proper coordination!
Don't hold anything back. To learn, we must\nsee how the master does it.
Do you have pressing business elsewhere,\nMaster? Then you can instruct us another time.
You are as strong as I thought, Master. Thank\nyou for showing us your incredible Triple Moves!
\PGot the \!!\Q
Come, Jagger! Let us emulate the master's\nexample before we forget!
But, Sensei, we can't do a Triple Move. We're a\nDouble at best.
Master Mario! We will devote ourselves to\ntraining, based on your example.
\PIt's been sealed.\Q
\PLook! The \! is reacting!\Q
\PThe seal has been broken!\Q
That guy next door is mumbling something again.
It's all "wishes of powerful people" this, and\n"crystal charged with even more power" that.
Isn't a crystal some kind of a shiny rock...or\nsomething? What's shinier than shiny?
Our neighbor's back, and he's at it again.\nI wonder if I'm stuck listening to him forever.
Here again? Do you think Culex is back?
I thought when we defeated him, he said farewell\nand went off somewhere.
He was the one who had "a flat plane of a form,"\ncorrect? Could he have returned?!
Hah! So what if he did? We thrashed him once.\nIf he needs a re-thrashing, I'll give it to him!
Denizens of the three-dimensional world...\nOur paths cross once more.
You have used your great strength to grant the\nwishes of powerful people.
The force of your strength resonated with my\nown wishes, enabling me to attain greater evil\npower and return to this plane.
You shall see this power firsthand!
I have attained greater evil power and returned\nto this plane.
You shall see this power firsthand!
Heh heh... Feast your eyes!
Unbelievable. You have defeated me at my\nstrongest, in my three-dimensional splendor.
The forces of malevolence have faded. I have\nlost my depths, diminished once more to the\nform of a flat plane.
I will withdraw to that land to regain my three-\ndimensional power and then await your return.
It took you \ \turns turn turns\ to defeat me this time.
That is quite a long time.
We were nearly evenly matched.
The gap between your power and mine has\nproven greater than I thought. I must admit it.
\PI await the destined one's return...\Q
So, you denizens of the three-dimensional world\ncome before me once again. I will fight you as\noften as you wish. Let the mightiest prevail!
You should have this. It has been passed down\nthrough the generations in what was, until\nrecently, the Jinx-Style Dojo.
\PThere are none more powerful than you!\Q
This new form is worthy of your three-\ndimensional world!
I return to this world remade.
I am matter and antimatter. I am past, present,\nand future. I will consume all time and space!
My evil power is in harmony with this three-\ndimensional world. And now, it will crush you!
Jagger. Watch my example closely, and then\nmatch my technique.
Game over!
Ran away.
Couldn't run!
Got a freebie!

You've got to take me down first!
Come on, brother! Let's thrash 'em!

Uh-oh, nya... No allies do I have to join forces\nwith, nya!

Yeah...maybe it'll seem less weird if we light\nthose candles.

Bad things will happen if all the candles are lit.
Finish the fight before that happens!
Booster seems to be up to something...
Engine 023 is in for maintenance. Sit tight until\nit's ready to depart!
You broke Booster's concentration!
I understand that you're eager to play, but you\ngotta wait until maintenance is complete.
We're here to support Booster so he can make\nprogress on his maintenance!
Booster will work faster!
Sorry for the delay! Engine 023 is now\ndeparting!
Now, show me your finest Triple Moves!
Your timing is sloppy. You're wide open!
So that's a Triple Move... I understand so\nclearly now! Thank you.
Can't run from this!
I wish to understand the true essence of\nTriple Moves. So I will reset your gauge!
With this perfect shield and these incredible\nbombs that can destroy anything...
the leveled-up me can't lose!
What do you think you're doing?! You're\nsupposed to attack those fools over there!
Grrrrr... I didn't think it would come to this.
I've got no choice but to pull out all the stops!
What the... Why are you looking at me\nlike that?
Argh!
The Lucky Jewel shattered!
Attack Action Commands succeed for two turns!

'Sup! I'm a Terrapin! I wish my gramps could\nsee me now!
Goom-de-goom... I'm tired.
What a nice, peaceful day. \L
You'll regret jumping on me. Go ahead and\ntry—I dare ya! What are ya, scared? Ha!
This bright sunlight better not fry me!
Can I have a bite?
Boing, boing, boing.
Splish, splash... Floop, flop...
Sing along with the rat funk, everybody!
I'm feelin' it more than usual today, baby!
You've got the kind of look a shadow\ncan appreciate.
Don't look at me, I'm shy...\n\KAaah! He's looking at meeeee!\
*grumble* Way to bother a person when\nthey're sleeping.
Wish people would stop confusing me with\nmy cousin.
Hold still, OK?!
I've seen a lot in this life.
Must...not...run away!
They call me Arachne 'cause I lack knees.
I'm just a friendly, harmless caterpillar.
I am a work of fiction. Any resemblance to\npreexisting apes is purely coincidental.
Sometimes I just wanna bask in the sun.
My wingy-thingies are pretty cool, right?
Buzzzzzzz buzzzzzzzz...
*crackle* *hiss*
Life's been lousy lately.
I'm on a mission. Stop reading my mind.\nOver and out.
I stepped on a sharp rock the other day\nand got hurt. Oof, it still smarts.
Watch out. I'm gonna explode. It'll hurt.
Group up! Don't break ranks! Looking at\nyou, left ear! You're drooping!
Attack with magic, and I'll psyche you out!
Whoa...this guy's scared of me!
Relax a little. Have a veggie or two.
Do people...not like me?
Don't be picky. Eat your veggies, kids!
Being an apprentice is tough! I can't take\nmuch more!
Do you smell something?
Go away, Chain Chomps! I'm not playing fetch\nwith you!
Note that I've nothing up my sleeve.
I'm not paid enough for this!
It's a cold, cruel world. Everyone has their\nstrings to pull...
My ultimate destiny is nothingness. Might as\nwell go out with a bang.
Blast first, ask questions later.
Blurb, blurb, blurb...
Lately, I've been feelin' chained down...
Why are you picking on me?
The red one, huh? What happened to the\ngreen guy?
You're masta-doomed!
I can't help being roguish. It's how I am.
By the stars, you'll regret hitting me!
Can you believe I get confused with those\nno-good Starslaps?
I need to go spray my dishes...
Floop, flop—don't get caught!
Floppy, floop—in a netted hoop.
Let's face it...I can't keep drifting forever.
Can I have just a tiny bit of your soul?
Whenever I reach out my hand, there\nyou are.
More and more, I've been thinking about\nreturning to the soil.
Put me together, I fall apart. Always leave 'em\nwanting more.
Wassat big Mario guy doin' lookin' at little\nol' me?
"Group up"? Yeah, right. Can we go home\nyet? I'm hungry.
I'm pretty strong, right? You're thinking about\nrunning away, right? Right?
Big hits come in micro packages!
I LOVE the color red!
I firmly believe blue is best. But I may change\nmy mind.
Oh! It's Mario! I'm fighting Mario! Me!
One can't stray from one's nature.
♪Even an octopus can fly if it tries.♪
Ahahah! I do whatever I want!
♪La dee dahh!♪ Haha.
I wanted to be just a normal flower...
I'm not venomous. Trust me.
The buzzer is about to sound for you!
Pucker up for a bruising! \L
Today's gonna be my day—I can feel it.
My dad, Frogog, says hi.
I have a secret!
Mwahaha...
*rattle* *rattle* I waited 100 years for that.\nAnd it was worth it.
At long, long last, I am FREEEEE!
Play with me! Play with me! GIVE ME\nATTENTION!
Ugh, I hate that Valentina.
Big is beautiful!
Wanna hear my new song?
Don't jump on me!
Our forecast for tomorrow? Let's just say,\nbring an umbrella. Next up, traffic...
You'll know you're a grown-up when your\njoints ache like mine.
Huh?
I might lose this fight.
You...are...magnificent.
Hit me to know happiness.
Do one good deed every day. Early to bed,\nearly to rise. And so on.
*rumble* *rumble*
It sure is hot here. I should move.
No matter where I go, I'm unwanted. Humph!
You're an adult. If you think something is\ntasty, then eat it.
Ugh! SERIOUSLY?!
...
An explosion of love!
Oh, Mr. Bowser!
Hey, maybe I CAN win!
Where's the crustacean station?
Everybody dance the poke-a!
I'm a high-level, elite Paratroopa. \L
I outgrew my old shell a while ago.
If there's one thing you can say for me,\nit's that I'm never afraid to shoot my shot.
You sure are a greedy one. \L
I don't show up much, so feast your eyes\nwhile you can.
Make way for fear itself!
Well. This is awkward. What should I say?
Trust me—if I didn't have to ride this thing,\nI wouldn't.
I fight for evildoers everywhere!
Why was I born dizzy?
I wish they'd bothered to paint me!
Truth is, things are rough.
Work, work, work...
Wham bam SLAM!
Love conquers ALL.
Come on, everybody! Look alive! Let's go!
Where did I come from? And where am I\nbound for?
Boing, boing, boing.
Mario! I'm BAAAAAAAACK!
*sigh* ♪Stomp, stomp, clap. Stomp,\nstomp, clap.♪
It's rough, you know... My shoulders are stiff\nthese days.
Number two am I, nya. Pretty pumped, I am,\nnya. Crush you I will, nya!
We still haven't decided on the members of\nthe team!
You look like a good meal!
I've got nothin-nin-nin to say.
I can't lose this time. My promotion is on\nthe line.
I'm more than a mere minion!
Maaariooo! It is ON!
Two coins an hour isn't payment enough for\nthis kind of work.
Think you know what my hammer can do?\nThink again, pal!
Gosh, I'm good!
Boing, boing, boing.
Boing, boing, boing.
I'm happiest when I sleep, you know.
What's with these folks? Dressed funny,\nthey are, nya. Furious it makes me, nya!
Ooh! I'm good!
So chic! Everyone is so chic!
I may be small, but I'm big inside!
I am ready to explode. You're standing too\nclose to be safe.
I feel like it's the last day of summer, and I just\nremembered all the homework I had.
Can there be no happiness without sacrifice?
Can there be no new era without misfortune?
Zis is not pound cake, so stop pounding it!
Con-grat-u-la-tions.
Congratulations!
No fire, please. I don't want to be fried.
You're not going to...eat me, are you?
This ship's mine! Scram!
You're good. Very good. Now this is a fight!
You're good. Very good. Now this is a fight!
If I lose, I can kiss that promotion goodbye.
Can they tell I'm a fake?
I'm also happiest when I'm eating.
...
Mom? Dad? Where are ya?
I need to collect the Star Pieces, quick!
My rrradiant, rrresplendent keep...
It should be a crime to be so beautiful.
I'm so excited, my blood is boiling!
You don't have the experience to beat me!
Sympathy!? Not from me!
I've committed your every move to memory!
Look away! Look away!
I got watered and grew quickly. I'll wilt quickly\ntoo. That's the life of a flower.
Don't rush me... \L
If someone has to finish me off, I'm glad it'll\nbe you. \L
My best traits? My cheerfulness and can-do\nattitude, probably.
I'm hungry...
I'm still hungry... I should head home already...
He's a small man who puts on a big front.
I'm fired up! Seriously, I'm on fire. How\nabout that?
I'm an ordinary rock, but I'm kinda fired up.
I'm not as dead as you might have thought.
Ugh! I got the pose wrong.
Red's pose was off, wasn't it? Are we good?
That group pose went off without a hitch.
Are we done here?
Red really missed his mark there.
Why do they always wait to use me?
Eep! Is that the baby from so long ago?
I'm the real thing!
I live to explode!
The time for words is past.
The time for words is past.
As long as my eyes are open, I'm invincible!
My vision is 20/66. What's more, I've got\nastigmatism.
My vision is 20/28. But that was from guessing\nblindly in the exam.
Weak... So weak...
I demand strict punctuality! No excuses!
Wake up, everyone. It's morning.
Can you follow the arc of my proud blade?
Gaaah! I'm too mad to think anymore!
I'll cast a spell on you. It's magic!
There's no feeling like blowing away\nyour enemies. \L
What a royal pain!
I lead a carefree life. Maybe too carefree?
I've put in 10 years here!
Twenty-five years of employment. *sigh*
The union, my son's exams, career changes...\nI've seen a lot during my time.
This month's goal is 1,000 Shymore units!
If we're beaten, there'll be no one to watch\nthe boss's back!
Eh?! Not bad!
I'm spitting hot fire!
I'm freshly made and piping hot! \L
Hm, you're not bad. That could be a problem.
Precision machines like me have to be careful\naround electricity.
Time to heal while nothing can hurt me!
Magic is my strength, but defense is\nmy weakness.
What's hidden inside?!
M-my head...so heavy!
I feel...a bit out of place.
I can't keep up with Master Culex anymore.
It's so dry here on the surface. I hate it!
Of course I'd get woken up in the middle of\na nice nap.
Whooooosh...
You shall bear witness to the power of\npost-game content!
Master Culex certainly has grown impressive.
I continue to hate how dry it is on the surface.
Personally, I'd never felt the need to become\nthree-dimensional.
Whooooosh... Swooooosh...
My throat's all scratchy. Life would be better\nif it wasn't.

I'm afraid to go to the bathroom at night.
Truth is, I don't care one bit about Star Pieces.
What a rrrrrollicking good time!
Hey, Chancellor. I'm the pretty one, right?
Everyone is even more chic now! You've\nreally leveled up your game.
How many times do I need to say, "Watch out.\nI'm gonna explode. It'll hurt," before you get it?
I feel like I just knocked my prized Impossible\nGrade model off the shelf while cleaning it.
I don't get enough paid vacation. I should get\nto cash it out at the end of the year!
I'm so sleepy...

"HEY! Are ya lookin' at me? My hammer\nand I don't like ya!"
Mario let me tag along to get back my\nstolen coin. He's tough, kind, and a\nreally great guy. That crook-o-dile\nmight've left town, so we'd better\nhurry and chase after him.
We caught Croco and got my coin\nback! Good thing Mario is here. Now\nI've gotta get back to the Mushroom\nKingdom item shop to finish the\nshopping Grandpa asked me to do.
We beat Claymorton, who was a pretty\ntough boss, and got a strange star.\nCould it have something to do with\nthis bad guy called "Smithy"? I'll try\nasking Grandpa at Tadpole Pond.
There was a cool person sleeping in a\nbed in the castle. I wanted to see what\nher thick pajamas felt like, but she\nstirred just before I could touch them,\nand Aran away.
Belome was pretty scary, but Mario\nand I beat it together. Then the water\nwashed us away, and we fell down the\nfalls to Midas River. The good news is\nwe're almost home at Tadpole Pond!
I'm adventuring with Mario to find out\nabout the stars that fell around the world.\nAlso, where are my real parents? I hope\nPrincess Peach is OK, wherever she\nlanded. Next stop—Rose Town!
We saw Bowser's Minions heading for\nhis keep. Bowser talked big, but I dunno\nif he can actually get back to his keep\nwhile the big sword is stuck in it. Plus, \nthe bridge is down...
Arrows are raining down on Rose Town.\nGrandpa was right—these people need\nour help! There's also funny rumors\nabout a living doll named Geno. Maybe\nwe can get some answers in the forest.
We recovered a Star Piece from the\nformidable Bowyer. I hate to leave Gaz\nbehind, but I'll need this body so my\nallies and I can find the Star Pieces.\nWith five left, there's a long way to go.
Congratulations on managing to collect\n100 coins! We look forward to your\nnext attempt.\n\-Midas River Course\
Someone heroic looking was sleeping\nin the Rose Town inn. I bet he's tired\nfrom his legends or adventures, but I'd\nlike to link up with him and chat over a\nTadpola Cola.
A Star Piece fell on Moleville, and a\ncouple of kids named Dyna and Mite\ngot trapped in the mines! But it's OK.\nMario will save them.
An explosion left us a bit worse for\nwear, but we secured the third Star\nPiece. Would even Punchinello's wishes\nbe granted at the Star Road? At any\nrate, we should find those children.
I'm glad Dyna was all right! Mite seems\nfine too. And the mine car was a real\nthrill to ride. Can we go on it again?
Mario and Yoshi raced Boshi on Yo'ster\nIsle, and won the whole thing! I'm not\ngood at racing or keeping rhythm, so\nI'm glad Mario is here to be so amazing\nat everything.
The ultra-tough Bowser says he'll let\nus join his minions. I'm already Mario's\nminion though. Now that our team's\nstronger, we're gonna rescue Princess\nPeach from Booster Tower!
Princess Peach and Booster's wedding\nis booked at the hall in Marrymore.\nBut the princess doesn't seem like she\nwants to get married, and Mario looks\nworried, so we should probably stop it.
We saved Princess Peach from the\nwedding, and Booster got to eat a big\ncake, so everything worked out OK?\nBut we should still get the princess\nback home to the Mushroom Kingdom.
Wow! Princess Peach snuck out of the\ncastle and joined the team. I hope the\nchancellor doesn't find out. We're gonna\ngo to Tadpole Pond now to ask Grandpa\nwhere the next Star Piece is.
We stayed in the Marrymore Hotel's\nsuite for the first time. I hear the rate is\n200 coins a night, which seems pricey.\nBut the room was so nice that I'd say\nit's worth it!
We tracked the fourth Star Piece to\nStar Hill, a sacred place where stars\nfall. We must find the remaining pieces\nquickly, for the sake of the ungranted\nwishes resting here.
Something seems kinda off about the\npeople in Seaside Town. A very\nimportant elder self-importantly told\nus a shooting star fell into the sea.\nWhat an important guy!
A giant squid and pirates stood in our\nway, but we wrested the star from a\npassionate fellow called Johnny Jones\nand got the fifth Star Piece. Now to\nreport to Seaside Town's elder.
With Johnny Jones's gracious aid, we\nbeat the craven Speardovich. The\ntown and the Star Piece are safe.\nBut the next star lies in a town of\nmonsters. What must that be like?
Monstermama told us about the place\nin the sky, so we're going to climb\nthe cliff in Land's End on our way to\nBean Valley. I'm excited to see what's\nup there!
Turns out I'm the prince of Nimbus Land!\nSo it's pretty fishy that Valentina has\nbeen parading a fake prince. Garro's\ngonna help us rescue my parents from\nthe castle!
We beat Valentina, and I got some\nquality time with my parents. Next,\nwe're going to have a good sweat\nat the hot springs before we start\nhunting for the star at the volcano.
We won the sixth Star Piece from\nthose allies of injustice, the Axem\nRangers. I'm curious where the last\none might be, but we should first let\nMallow's parents know that he's OK.
We won a hard-fought battle against\nJinx, whose reputation was on the line.\nHe claims that he'll begin intensive jump\ntraining to run the place as a Mario-style\ndojo, but will he really?
We emerged victorious against the\npowerful foe, Culex. It was certainly\na difficult fight. He spoke of fighting\nfor a Dark Mage, but I didn't find him\nto be such a bad fellow.
It's just a quick flight to Bowser's\nKeep on the royal bus! The bus is\nsupposed to be just for Nimbus\nroyalty, so do I count as that now?\nAnyway, it was a really comfy ride.
We overcame trials in Bowser's Keep,\nbeat powerful foes like Boomer and Exor,\nand have finally reached the weapons'\nworld. If the last Star Piece is here, it will\nmean the end of our long journey.
We crossed paths with Culex again in\nthree-dimensional form. It was an even\nmore grueling fight. But once again,\nwhen defeated, Culex didn't seem to\nbe up to anything overtly evil.

Guards in Bowser's Keep who are far\ntoo weak. Their helmets limit their\nvision, so they simply throw punches\nat random and hope for a lucky hit.
They hold the chandeliers in their teeth\nwithout uttering a single complaint.\n(If they opened their mouth to speak,\nthey'd drop the chandeliers.)
Most Goombas can be defeated just\nby stomping on their heads. But watch\nout! These Goombas' heads are hard\nenough to attack with.
Doesn't it seem like the impact sound\nof their ramming attack, reverberating\ninside their shells while they're inside,\nwould get on their nerves?
The sharp spikes on their backs are\nimportant protection against Mario's\njump attacks, so they require diligent\nmaintenance.
They pretended there was only one, but\nwhen the battle started, suddenly there\nwere two. Where in the world was the\nother one hiding?
Frogogs dislike hanging out with other\nFrogogs, because if they do and\nsomeone calls out "Frogog!" it's\nhard to tell who they mean.
Their official name is "Blueish-Tinged\nGray K-9." Due to character count\nlimitations, it displays as simply "K-9"\nin game.
He doesn't actually realize the value of\nMallow's grandpa's coin. He just thought\nMallow looked like an easy mark.
They look like Shy Guys, but they're a\ncompletely different species that's\npart of the Smithy Gang. They attack\nwith vehicles called Shyhoppers.
They got roped into being Claymorton's\nbodyguards because they happened to\nbe standing there. Otherwise, they're\nnot much stronger than other Shymores.
It may seem like he loves bouncing as\nmuch as Shymores. Wrong. He loves it\nway more. All he ever thinks about is\nhow cool he can make his next bounce.
A Cheep Cheep born and raised in the\nsewers, washed away to a certain\npond. It returned to the sewers later\nsince all its assets were underwater.
They live underground or in other damp\nplaces. But they're actually sticklers\nfor cleanliness, so they wear white\ngloves to keep their hands germ-free.
Since becoming undead, they've sung\nnothing but elegies each day. But they\ndo wish they could sometimes sing\nupbeat, happy songs as well.
These monsters are born from dim\nlight and dwell in darkness. Shadows\nmay even lurk in the nooks and\ncorners of rainy cities.

When a Crook flees without stealing\nanything, it's because they've\nabandoned the idea of Mario\ncarrying anything of value.
Arachnes have a rude habit of using\ntheir Venom Drool on foes lacking\nCleansing Juice.
Is the Forest Maze known as Wiggler\nForest because Wigglers live there, or\nare they called Wigglers because they\nlive in Wiggler Forest? No one knows.
They have high HP and Attack, and their\nthrown rocks hurt quite a bit, so watch\nout for that. They often get mistaken for\nsomeone else.
Amanitas are always spinning round and\nround. They will probably spin forever,\nso long as this world keeps turning.

The debate over whether these are\nbumblebees or rumblebees has raged\nfor nearly 30 years, but the true answer\nis in your heart.
The heads of the Rose Town citizens\nlooked like targets to him, so he let\nloose a volley of arrows on them. He is\nattended by his arrow followers, Aeros.
They're on fire, but do they get hot?\nOr burned? No matter what you ask\nthem, they just keep burning away.\nWhat goes on in their little minds?
They face upward and snap their jaws\nthreateningly before biting. They\nhaven't realized that this telegraphs\ntheir attacks for Action Commands.

Before he knew it, the three fledgling\nthieves he met on Rose Way looked to\nhim as a leader. They've since had many\nsuccessful escapes as a gang.
Punchinello created these bombs by\nstudying Bob-ombs. Due to their smaller\nsize, they're also less powerful than a\ntrue Bob-omb.
Punchinello left home to accomplish\nsomething big. This outsized bomb\nwas one stab at making that dream\ncome true.
As a result of throwing bombs willy-\nnilly to become a famous bomb-maker,\nhe faced exploder's remorse and\nflamed out early.
Apparently the Spikeys living in\nBooster Pass turned green from the\nhealth drinks they subsist on, which\nare made from fresh grass.

As apprentices, they undergo intense\ndaily training—such as chasing beetles—\nin hopes of becoming Snifsters.
They seem to have no interest in\nbecoming Snifsters and are content\nto remain Snifits forever.
They look like magic staves, but they\nhave cutting-edge features, such as\nthe ability to stretch or shrink\nthemselves at will.
They carry cards with them, so they're\nalways ready to play. But their habit of\nthrowing cards around means they\nnever get to play with a full deck.
Those who distinguish themselves are\npromoted to Snifsters. Scuttlebutt is\nthat whoever defeats the intruder in\nthe tower will get the nod.

When becoming a Chow, a Blueish-\nTinged Gray K-9's fur changes from\nblueish-tinged gray, making it stronger\nthan a Blueish-Tinged Gray K-9.
They wait for foes in the sinkholes of\nthe Land's End desert. You can get\na Frog Coin by stomping on them in\nthe field three times.
They picked the name "Octovader" to\nseem cool. They're rivals with Octolots\nand always vattle when they meet.\nTheir favorite fruit is vananas.
Apparently they're called Geckits\nbecause they're Geckos who are a\nlittle more with-it. But no fashion\nstatement stays in style forever.
Apparently they have their own theme\nsong called "Beat It, Beezo!" which they\nseldom sing in front of others. If you\nmanage to hear it, count yourself lucky.
For most flora, a flower of a different\ncolor is still the same species. But for\nthis monster, when its color changes,\nits name changes along with it.
Judging by their looks, you'd think\nthey deliver powerful venom. Instead,\nthey turn their foes into scarecrows,\nwhich is so much worse.
These seem to be called Stingers\nbecause of their pointy barbs. But\nBuzzers also have stingers, and\nStingers make buzzing sounds, so...
The wishy-washy behavior they exhibit\nby attacking with leaf whips, before\nblowing a sweet kiss, is less carrot\nstick than carrot-and-stick.
You may think you've seen these\nscurrying steps elsewhere. But if you\nlisten to the footsteps closely, it's\nmore like a riff on a familiar theme.
Frogogs name their children Ribbites.\nBut what do Ribbites name their\nchildren? They don't appear in this\ngame, so we may never know.
Who knows where he went off to or\nwhat he was doing, but that rascally\nBelome—or rather, Belõme—has shown\nhis face again.
You normally only see Mario from the\nback, so getting to observe his attacks\nhead-on is a rare experience.
Since he is a clone, he is considerably\nless fluffy. He also doesn't cry as easily\nand, of course, he can probably go to\nthe bathroom at night all by himself.
Technically, this is a Geno Doll Clone.\nA nicer way to put it might be to call\nit a Geno Doll Replica. A less-nice way\nwould be a Geno Doll Knock-Off.
It's easy to tell that this is the clone\nbecause of the fancy way he rolls his\nRs when he speaks. You don't hear\nthat? Trust us, he does.
Very well-made, for a clone. If brought\nto the Mushroom Kingdom, the\nchancellor would no doubt believe that\nPrincess Peach was still in the castle.
Despite all his training, he's not much\nstronger. But that's no surprise, since\nhis strategy is still based around hoping\nfor a lucky hit.
(He's nowhere near experienced\nenough to beat me. I should be OK as\nlong as I use Valor Up and occasionally\nattack twice.)
(...This is a bad time for me to start\nsympathizing with my opponents. I've\ngot Quicksilver and Silver Bullet, and\nthey won't be expecting those.)
(If they let their guard down, they're\ndone for. They'll learn that soon\nenough. With Bombs Away after Vigor\nUp, I'm not holding back! I can't lose!)
He crossed dimensions in order to come\nhere from the world of "Last Illusion,"\na story about crystals. Too bad he's still\nso two-dimensional.
A crystal with mastery over fire.\nIt has a burning dissatisfaction with\nits master, who is trying to turn the\nfire of justice into a malevolent force.
A crystal with mastery over water.\nIt requires a damp environment to\nbestow the soothing power of water,\nwhich supports life.
A crystal with mastery over earth.\nAfter its long slumber deep within\nthe earth, it unleashed amplified\ntremors all at once as it awakened.
A crystal with mastery over wind.\nThe howls of wind crossing the world\nand whipping up the atmosphere echo\nthunderously from it.
Freakin' out about what might be in the\nbox? You should be—it's a Pleaseno!\nThey never, ever stop watching you.
It was caught cheating at treasure-\nchest slots and confined inside\nPleaseno as punishment, where it is\nbeing forced to clean.
They might seem riled up, but they're\njust playful at heart. They get a bad rap\nbecause of their absurdly painful bite.
Is it strange to call these "Smilaxes"\nwhen the only time they show their\npearly teeth is to bite?
It can use Petal Blast even though it\nisn't the right season for it to bloom.\nThat's what you get from a freak of\nnature like this. Pretty though.
Grinder is their move where they\nswipe with their spears instead of\nusing their claws. As they say, "the\nearly Birdy grinds the worm."
In their downtime from serving in\nBowser's Minions, they're in high\ndemand as shell-wax models. Double-\npage spreads only, of course.
When they ring their bells and let fly with\na Doom Reverb, it feels to you like the\ngloves are off. But to them, they're just\ntreating you to a song.
They want to heal injured Orb Users,\nbut they're going through a trial\nseparation right now. Will the Orb\nUsers and Orbisons ever reunite?
They spin to blow air and hinder people\nwalking, but I've heard a rumor on\nthe wind that there's one in a town\nsomewhere blowing pleasant breezes.
They may have the same appearance\nand behavior as Leukos, distinguished\nonly by their color, but they're definitely\nnot filler. That's just how monsters are.
These big eaters are known as the\ngourmands of the imp world. They love\nmeat dishes, especially hamburgers and\nhashed-beef rice.
Strong enemies who employ powerful\nmagic. Some of them retire and enjoy\na second career as shopkeepers.
If you underestimate one, thinking it's no\ndifferent from a Birdy, its powerful ice\nmagic will leave you pale with fear.
To understand what they're all about,\nyou need to peek at the thoughts of the\nperson inside, not the suspicious Shelly.
The way that she shut herself away\ninside Shelly may mean that she was\npatiently pining for the one who'd\ncome break open her shell.
They may bounce like they haven't a\ncare in the world, but if they're hit with\nan attack, they'll explode immediately.\nTalk about being eggciteable.
He imprinted on Valentina when he\nhatched and thought she was his\nmother. He was shocked to discover he\nwas secretly prince of Nimbus Land.
He resents Valentina, who's not his\nreal parent, and took it out on some of\nher statues. But ultimately, he can't\nignore his debt to her for raising him.
She knows enough about food to\npronounce "pizza" in the traditional way.\nHer favorite candy is those Valentine's\nmessage hearts, chalky as they are.
Since they resemble Magmite in shape\nand color, and because their names\nstart with the same four letters, they\noften get each other's mail by mistake.
They're jealous of Shoguns because\ntheir names sound a lot cooler.
I've seen a whole lotta monsters, but I\nstill have a really hard time telling the\ndifference between Lava Babbles and\nLava Bubbles.
Those who fled from the village of the\nGuerrillas settled at Barrel Volcano.\nAs time passed, they eventually came\nto be known as Chained Kongs.
Is it too much of a stretch to guess that\nthe reason they carry water bottles is\nto fight the heatstroke caused by the\nvolcano's unbearable temperature?
These urchin-like creatures were\nthought to live only in the sea. But\nthese live in a sea of magma.
They give new meaning to the idea of\nstomping your feet in frustration.
Because they don't touch the ground,\nthey can't stamp along with their feet.\nIt must be a frustrating feeling.
Their go-to attack is Backfire, but when\nthey're in a tough fight, or fly off the\nhandle, or fall in love, they get agitated\nand use Va-Va-Voom instead.
Stone statues were built in its image to\nsoothe its temper. But the likeness was\nway off, so in the end they didn't have\nmuch of an effect.
It looks like a rock, so you might wonder\nif it can even be considered a monster.\nBut since you can get a peek at its\nthoughts, it must be one, right?
The character designer's reasoning for\ngiving it tattered clothing only after it\nbecomes zombified is because it didn't\nlook like a zombie without it.
Though he is the de facto leader of the\nAxem Rangers, he's so careless that he\noften flubs his poses, intro speeches,\nand group formations.
He's cool and composed...but like all the\nAxem Rangers, something about him is\na bit pathetic. He got his beloved\nsunglasses at a dollar store.
Always calm and doesn't sweat the small\nstuff. The other Axem Rangers think he's\naloof, but he hasn't bothered to notice.
Considers himself the looker of the\nteam. He tires easily, not from being out\nof shape, but from too much hot yoga.
She considers herself the princess of\nthe group. Meeting an actual princess\nhas done nothing to change her mind\non this point.
Admittedly, its Breaker Beam attack\nwould be cooler if it was called "Absolute\nBreaker of Champions Beam." But we're\nnot getting paid by the word here.
A step up in terms of power compared\nto Terrapins, but at the end of the day,\nthey're still Terrapins. Their red color\ndoesn't make them three times as fast.
The "Pro" in their names makes them\nsound like professionals, but their use\nof Thornet is amateurish at best. You\ncan't always trust branding.
The "star" part has nothing to do with\nthe Star Road or Star Pieces. We just\nthought it was a nice-sounding name.\nIs that so wrong?
Unlike Jawfuls, they prefer seafood.\nThey get carried away thinking about\nraw-oyster season.
These guys fly pretty quick. Maybe\nthey should change their name to\nMalazoomas instead.
They have more HP than Big Troopas,\nbut the real reason for their higher rank\nis their outsized personalities.
They look just like Blasters but count\nas separate monsters because of their\ndifferent abilities. New versions of tech\nalways have minor feature upgrades.
Terrified of what might be in the box?\nYou should be—it's a Comeon! They're\nalmost invariably watching you.
Though they're very powerful, they don't\nshow up in battle unless summoned.\nWhich means they spend most of their\nlives waiting for their moment to shine.
With Wizakoopa's magical treasure box,\nhaving 9,999 coins is no mere fantasy.\nJust be careful not to hit it so much that\nyour arm cramps.
Unlike the Mario Clone or Bowser Clone,\nthere's no deep lore behind this clone\nof Jinx. The power of its Silver Bullet\nmove is the real deal.
Trust Wizakoopa to handle a bomb even\nflashier than the Mezzo Bomb, crowning\nachievement of the master bomb maker\nPunchinello. Some dud he was...
In addition to the sword, bow, spear and\naxe bosses Smithy forged, there's also\nthis katana wielder. Though a weapon\nboss, he has the heart of a samurai.
It's named after the legendary sword\nExcalibur. But since swords don't exist\nin Mario's world, there's no way for\nMario to get the reference.
Just as there are dominant hands, there\nare dominant eyes too. This Right Eye\nhas more HP than the Left Eye, so Exor's\ndominant eye must be the right one.
My vision is 20/200. Add astigmatism to\nthat and throw in the fact that I'm getting\nolder and need reading glasses, and\nI'm struggling to even write this text.
When you eat something delicious, the\ntaste flows across your mouth. But the\nonly thing flowing from Exor's mouth is\nthe gate to the weapon world.
Driven by terror, they swing their Fear\nSickles. When that escalates to a\nReaper Sickle, then it's really overkill.
They look like Goombas, but they're\nsquishy and have cute, round eyes. If\nyou run up against one, just smile and\nhope for the best.
A: The Hippopo is the animal            (3%)\nB: The Hippopo is the rider               (1%)\nC: It could be either                         (96%)
If you're reading this at one in the\nmorning, it's time to stop playing\nthis game.
The morning bell (right) and the evening\nbell (left) come together to form a single\nRing-a-Ding. They're watching around\nthe clock to startle oversleepers awake.
Though he is the de facto leader of the\nAxem Rangers, he's so careless that he\noften flubs his poses, intro speeches,\nand group formations. Same for this one.
This mass-produced version has mass-\nproduced sunglasses too. He's glad not\nto have to go buy his own anymore.
Always calm and doesn't sweat the small\nstuff. The Machine Made version of him\ndoesn't have problems with aloofness.
Considers himself the looker of the\nteam. Although now that there are so\nmany of him, he's no longer sure which\nis the most beautiful.
She considers herself the princess of\nthe group. In her eyes, all the other\nMachine Made versions of her are\nduchesses at best.
It seems like even Smithy himself wasn't\nsure which weapon this monster was\nsupposed to be themed around.
They absolutely adore their job and think\nabout it constantly. Their job being\nsmashing stuff, of course.
They absolutely adore smashing stuff\nand think about it constantly. Smashing\nstuff being their job, of course.
They absolutely adore love and think\nabout it constantly. Love being what\nthey know will win in the end, though of\ncourse that's not part of their job.
There are no Machine Made versions of\nShymores or Springers. This is because\nthey were designed for mass production\nfrom the start.
Smithy is primarily a metalsmith, but if\nhe can make wooden puppets like these,\nhe must be a skilled woodworker as well.
From weakest to strongest, it goes\nShymore, Bodyguard, Springer, then\nMachine Made Bodyguard. But at the\nend of the day, it's still a minion.
You might think the already-strong\nClaymorton would be terrifying when\nmass-produced, but Mario's team is a\nlot stronger than they were then.
They seem to have a lot more guts than\nregular Boos. Their own screams only\nscare themselves a little.
I went as a Boo for Halloween. The kids\nthought I was cute and had big smiles on\ntheir faces. I was a Doppel the next year,\nand those smiles turned to shrieks.
The cost of mass-producing Bowyers\nis sky-high, since each one requires\ndozens of mass-produced Aeros.
Originally, ninjas concealed themselves\nunder cover of night. But these wear\nfluttering red scarves and outfits that\nlook like they'd be a hit with tourists.
He's shaped a little like a clay pot, but\nSmithy isn't a potter, so he's still made\nof iron. His mustache is made of ultra-\nthin iron plates painted white.
He may look like he's just riding on his\nsnake's head, but Cloaker insists that\nthey have formed a single creature.
He looks exactly like a magician, and he\nmainly attacks using spells. I get wanting\na magic boss here, but what happened\nto the whole "weapon world" shtick?
He may look like he's just riding on his\nsnake's head, but Domino insists that\nthey have formed a single creature.
Apparently it would be called something\nelse if it had fused with Domino instead\nof Cloaker. Which raises the question...\nwhat is this monster's true name?
Apparently it would be called something\nelse if it had fused with Cloaker instead\nof Domino. Which raises the question...\nwhat is this monster's true name?
If all the Machine Made Speardoviches\nsought promotions, the Smithy Gang\nwould have an impossibly top-heavy\norganizational chart.
When a Machine Made Speardovich\nfalls apart, it becomes a Jabit. Their\noverall design must have reminded\nSmithy of a spear tip.
Ten years since I signed on with Smithy,\nhuh? I'm finally managing a production\nline and have Mad Mallet subordinates.\nWhere has the time gone?
I've put my nose to the grindstone for\n25 years and finally climbed my way up\nto manager. But I can still aim higher and\nboost my efficiency from 30% to 45%.
Luckily, I was able to shift into a director\nrole at an industry-leading firm at this\ncritical time with my son's exams. Now\nI'll work with the union on labor reform.
If we can meet this month's goal of\n1,000 Shymore units, then next month\nwe can look forward to a goal of 50 full\nGunyolk units!
Smithy didn't even make this. A mere\nFactory Chief was the one who invented\nit. In that light, does it still qualify as\na monster?
I'm worried about customer complaints\nif we advertise this thing—which is in no\nway alive—as a monster.
As previously explained, Shymores are\nnot Shy Guys, and neither are Shypers.\nThey're Smithy originals.

Belome has lived in Belome Temple\nsince long before people started calling\nthe Frog Sage a sage, back in the days\nwhen he had just grown his hind legs.
It's unclear what this Mario Clone is\nthinking. Why can't he use gestures to\nconvey his thoughts like the real one?
This monster's belt says "Mallow" too,\nso it's doubtful that even the Frog Sage\ncould tell him apart from the real deal.
It's noticeable that he doesn't use Geno\nBoost to power up his allies. Apparently\nGeno's considerate nature didn't come\nthrough in the cloning process.
This Bowser Clone would likely try to\nkidnap the Peach Clone as usual, but\nthe Mario Clone couldn't care less.
If she was copied this faithfully from the\nreal Peach, then surely her shoes, ring,\nbroach, and crown are all identical to\nthe original's as well.
He says he wants to go home famous.\nLittle does he know that he's already\nwell-known in his hometown as a\ngoofball who Mario beat twice.
Punchinello's most powerful bomb,\ncreated after honing his bomb-making\nskills. Looks like this time, he wasn't\nbluffing about his last resort.
He sold his favorite game to a boy in the\nMushroom Kingdom for 100 coins to\nraise funds. Do you suppose the boy is\nplaying that game even now?
They've gone through intensive training\nby chasing beetles at full speed and\ndashing up steep hills.
Since Tortes wear their chef hats low\nover their eyes, they feel sure that no\none would notice if they nodded off\nduring a late-night shift. Probably.
Having been created for a celebration,\nit naturally thinks each time its candles\nare lit is a joyous occasion, which makes\nit more and more excited.
Whenever Bundt gets excited, this lower\nlayer is a little sad that it doesn't have\ncandles of its own.
It was only after the rematch that Jinx\nrealized if he was going to learn anything\nabout teamwork moves, Jagger should\nhave fought as well.
After the final great showdown with his\nstrongest opponent ever, Johnny looked\nout the window and thought, "I burned\nbright, didn't I? Like a blue flame..."
You beat the toughest fight in the game!\nThanks for playing all the way to the\nvery end!\n\-The Development Staff\
A crystal with the power of fire. It's\nunhappy with its master, who wants\nto use the fire of justice for evil.
A crystal with the power of water. It\nneeds a wet place to grant the healing\npower of water, which gives life.
A crystal with the power of earth. It slept\nunderground for a long time, causing\nextra-bad earthquakes.
A crystal with the power of wind. The\nsound of wind slicing through the air\ncan be heard all over the world.
He thought he was unstoppable as long\nas he was on the chandelier. Too bad\nfor him that he underestimated Mario's\npowerful jump.
