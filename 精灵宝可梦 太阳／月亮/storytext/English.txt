0	Welcome to the Battle Tree. I’m the receptionist.
1	How can I help you?
2	What would you like to hear about?
3	You can enjoy various kinds of battles with\nmany different Trainers here.\c\nYou can choose either Single Battles, Double\nBattles, or Multi Battles.\c\nYou’ll be competing to see how many Trainers\nyou can win your way through in a row.\c\nIf you lose even once, your win streak will\nend there. You’ll have to start over from zero,\r\nso please be careful.\c\nEach time you defeat a Trainer you’ll receive\nBattle Points, or BP, that you can use to scout\r\nTrainers or exchange for prizes.\c\nThe longer your win streak, the more BP\nyou’ll receive.\c\nDo your best to set an awesome record!
4	There are three important points you need to\nkeep in mind to battle at the Battle Tree.\c\nFirst, battles at the Battle Tree are held under\nFlat Rules.\c\nAny Pokémon higher than level 50 will have\ntheir level lowered to 50.\c\nSecond, you’ll need a certain number of\nPokémon for your battles.\c\nYou’ll need three for Single Battles, four for\nDouble Battles, and for Multi Battles, each\r\nTrainer will need two.\c\nAnd the last thing, you can’t use more than one\nof the same Pokémon or item in your battles.\c\nHowever, if your partner in a Multi Battle has\nthe same Pokémon or item as you, that’s not\r\na problem.
5	We hope to see you again.

1	Would you like to have a Battle Royal?
2	What rank will you enter as?
3	Would you like to take part in a Hyper Rank\nBattle Royal match?
4	Would you like to take part in a Master Rank\nBattle Royal match?
5	A Pokémon Battle Royal takes part between four\nTrainers, who each bring three Pokémon into the\r\nring for a four-way free for all!\c\nEvery other Trainer in the ring is an opponent,\nand the goal of each match is to win your way\r\nthrough to victory against them all.\c\nOnce any of the participating Trainers have all\nthree of their Pokémon faint and can no longer\r\nbattle, the match ends.\c\nWhichever Trainer is in first place at the point\nwhen the battle ends will be the winner.\c\nPlaces are decided by how many Pokémon\nyou’ve defeated and how many you have left.\c\nYou score higher by defeating more Pokémon\nand having fewer Pokémon on your team faint.\c\nIf you tie with another Trainer based on these\ntwo factors, then the one who defeated more\r\nPokémon will be declared the winner.\c\nIf it’s still a tie, then whoever has the most\nnet HP left will be declared the winner.\c\nTry your best to knock out as many other\nPokémon as possible while keeping your\r\nPokémon from fainting!\c\nNow that we’ve reviewed all that, let me ask\nyou once again...
6	Then please select the Pokémon you would\nlike to battle with.
7	I am the Masked Royal!\c\nI heard about your efforts here at the Battle\nDome, and it made me want to battle you!\r\nLet’s do this. Woo!
8	It looks like you’re all ready for battle.\nThen please come this way.
9	Then we hope you’ll come back again!
10	Good effort today!
11	Congratulations on your win!\c\nYou tried really hard today, [VAR 0189(0000)].\nYou and [VAR 0102(0001)] both!
12	You’ll be promoted up to Super Rank for your\nnext battle, [VAR 0189(0000)]!

1	An Alolan Picture Book\nWherein a Pikachu, Pyukumuku, and Slowpoke\nprepare to set out on an island challenge—but\nthe preparations themselves are so fun and\nexhausting that they never leave home!
2	On How to Heal Your Pokémon\nWhen your Pokémon are injured or suffering \nfrom some status condition, either get them to\na Pokémon Center or use the appropriate \nmedicines on them!
3	On How to Trigger Abilities\nMethod 1: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon appears in a battle, and its effects will\nthen continue as long as that Pokémon remains\nin the battle.\c\nMethod 2: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon takes an attack from an opponent.\n\nMethod 3: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon is not in a Pokémon battle.
4	On the Origins of the Alola Region\nThe islands of Alola were given form when\nunderwater volcanoes erupted long, long ago.\nPokémon came to live in Alola when they flew,\nswam, or were carried on the wind to the isles.
5	On the Number of Pokémon Moves\nAs of this writing, scholars in this field have\nidentified more than 600 distinct moves that\ncan be used by Pokémon in battle.\c\nYet each Pokémon is only able to remember\na maximum of four moves at a time.\nTo learn a fifth move, it must forget one of the\nother moves that it knows.\c\nAdditionally, it must be noted that there are\nalso many different ways through which\nPokémon are able to learn moves.\nThere is still much for us to learn about the\nrelationship of Pokémon and their moves.
6	On the Classification of Pokémon Moves\nPokémon moves can be divided into three broad\ncategories: physical moves, special moves, and\nof course status moves.\c\nPHYSICAL MOVES\nMoves that attack an opponent, dealing damage\nbased upon the Attack stat of the Pokémon\nusing the move and the Defense stat of the\nPokémon on the receiving side.\c\nSPECIAL MOVES\nMoves that attack an opponent, dealing damage\nbased upon the Sp. Attack stat of the Pokémon\nusing the move and the Sp. Defense stat of the\nPokémon on the receiving side.\c\nSTATUS MOVES\nMoves that have effects other than directly\nattacking another target in battle.

0	Welcome to the Pokémon Center Café! The time\nin Alola is now [VAR 0201(0000)] o’clock.\c\nHere in our café space, we provide a moment of\npeace to our customers.
1	Please come visit us again soon!
2	What can I get started for you today?
3	Lemonade
4	Tapu Cocoa
5	Moomoo Milk
6	Pinap Juice
7	Roserade Tea
8	Komala Coffee
9	A [VAR 01C2(0002)] will be $[VAR 0202(0001)].\nWill that be all right?
10	This is our café’s original blend, made with\nplenty of freshly picked Alolan Berries.\c\nIts intensely sweet flavor will linger on\npleasantly for hours.
11	Just one sip and you’ll be hooked.\c\nThis milk is so mellow, yet rich, that it’ll \nmake you wish your mother were a Miltank.
12	Please enjoy the harmonious tones of sweet\nand sour that can only be performed by Pinap\r\ngrown under the Alolan sun.
13	We’ve mixed up all different kinds of Berries to\nmake this special Lemonade!\c\nThe refreshing sweetness of it might just\nswallow you!
14	Moomoo Milk!\c\nGulping it down will bring a smile to your face\nand your heart!
15	This highly aromatic tea is made with extracts\nfrom Roserade’s favorite leaves.\c\nWhen you drink it, you may find yourself wanting\nto Petal Dance.
16	Never mind
17	When your adventures have tired you out,\nit’s time to relax with a hot cup of Tapu Cocoa.\r\nYou’ll love it iced, too.
18	Pinap Berries don’t deal well with wind or cold.\nHere in the Alola region, however, they can grow\r\nto their full potential under the Alolan sun.\c\nMeaning they’re really delicious.
19	Enjoy this mellow tea made from the Pokémon \nRoserade’s favorite leaves which we\r\nhave fermented.
20	This Lemonade is made artisanally by hand, so it\nmust be better than what you get out of a\r\nvending machine.\c\nIt is, right?
21	Chocolate cream...\c\nTapu Cocoa is so good it’ll make you\ncompletely forget about counting calories!\c\nMaybe I’ll stop worrying about my blood sugar\nlevel and have some, too.
22	Don’t you think sour juice makes your body\nfeel great?\c\nOf course it’s just a feeling, but I guarantee\nthe taste.
23	Such a rich and mellow flavor...\c\nTapu Cocoa makes you feel so warm inside,\nit’s as if the tapu are watching over you.
24	You try to stay cool when you taste the\nspiciness, and you try to act strong when the\r\nsourness hits you.\c\nTry gulping down a glass of Pinap Juice\nlike that!
25	Coffee from Alola is famous all over the world.\c\nEven the timid Pokémon Granbull, with its scary\nface, can’t help but smile when it drinks some.
26	Drinking Tapu Cocoa improves your\ncirculation, allowing you to feel more relaxed.\c\nMixing in a little salt is also quite nice.
27	We’ve pressed the skins of Pinap Berries,\nfreshly picked on Akala, to make this juice.\c\nI ate all the flesh myself! It was crazy spicy!
28	The bitterness comes pouring out...\c\nJust one sip could knock you out like the\nPokémon Komala.
29	This Moomoo Milk is made with milk I\njust collected.\c\nAllow it to roll gently across your tongue as you\ndrink it.
30	When you peel a Pinap Berry, it’ll make your\nfingers tingle.\c\nBut I guarantee this juice is even better than\nthe Berry Juice that Shuckle make!
31	I became an apprentice to a mysterious barista\nand, after many struggles, I am finally allowed to\r\nbrew some coffee.\c\nWhat I have brewed is this mythical\nKomala Coffee.
32	We’ve crushed all kinds of Berries and mixed\nthem all up!\c\nHuzzah for you, who ordered this\nspecial Lemonade!
33	It’s good to gulp down fresh Moomoo Milk.
34	When you taste Roserade Tea, you’ll first notice\na Sweet Scent filling your nose.\c\nDrink it while it’s hot, before you miss out on\nthe fullness of its aroma!
35	Here in the Alola region we can harvest\nmany Berries, so we use over 50 kinds of\r\nBerries to make this.\c\nBut I’m actually too lazy to use so many, so I\njust throw in about 47.
36	This Tapu Cocoa is our specialty here.\c\nBy the way, did you know the English word\n“taboo” may have its origins here in Alola?\c\nBut I’m actually too lazy to check whether\nthat’s true or not, though.
37	You can get Moomoo Milk from Miltank.\c\nThis is just between you and me, but there’s a\nGym Leader named Whitney in Goldenrod City\r\nwith a Miltank.\c\nI heard that you can get some real tip-top\nMoomoo Milk from her Miltank. \c\nBut I’m actually too lazy to check whether\nthat’s true or not, though.
38	This is the finest Tapu Cocoa I have ever\nmade in my life. Please savor it.\c\nOf course I will continue to work hard to\nsurpass even this Tapu Cocoa.
39	In the old days Moomoo Milk was regarded as a\nhighly nutritious medicine.\c\nIf you drink two cups a day, other than the\noccasional tummy ache, you’ll be the picture\r\nof health!
40	In the old days Moomoo Milk was regarded as a\nhighly nutritious medicine.\c\nIf you drink two cups a day, other than the\noccasional tummy ache, you’ll be the picture\r\nof health!
41	I’ll be able to brew and offer you the finest\ncoffee only if I continue Pokémon battling and\r\nsurpass my master, a mysterious barista.
42	By using Berries that have become almost too\nripe to eat, our Lemonade here has a depth like\r\nnone other.\c\nWe’re quite proud of just how sour it is.
43	We had to battle Roserade to gather all the\nleaves for this tea.\c\nEnjoy it to your heart’s content. If you don’t, my\ngrandson who gathered the leaves will never\r\nfind peace.
44	We blend beans that we import from\na distant region.\c\nIn other words, you can experience not just one\nnovel flavor but several!\c\nIt might not actually be correct to call this\nKomala Coffee.
45	Got it! Then if you’ll just give me a moment...
46	Here you are!\c\nOne [VAR 01C2(0002)] just for you!
47	I’m sorry, but it looks like you don’t quite have\nenough this time.\c\nBut I really do appreciate how much you love\nour drinks, and I thank you for stopping by!
48	Here you are. This will make you feel better.
49	Here you are. This will clear your head.
50	Here you are. This will wake you up.
51	All the cool kids headed for their trial at\nBrooklet Hill are drinking Tapu Cocoa.\c\nAgainst Water-type Pokémon, Grass types and\nElectric types can attack efficiently.
52	All the cool kids headed for their trial at\nBrooklet Hill are drinking Moomoo Milk.\c\nAgainst Water-type Pokémon, Grass types and\nElectric types can attack efficiently.
53	All the cool kids headed for their trial at\nBrooklet Hill are drinking Pinap Juice.\c\nAgainst Water-type Pokémon, Grass types and\nElectric types can attack efficiently.
54	This is the best Moomoo Milk in all of Alola!\c\nI won’t bother you with all the details of\neverything it took to get it here to you, but try\r\nto imagine while you’re drinking it.\c\nBy the way, if you don’t finish it all, can I have\nthe rest?
55	I brew very strong Roserade Tea because if it\nwas weak, you wouldn’t get the stimulation you\r\nwant no matter how many cups you drink of it.\c\nIf you want to make it weaker, add Moomoo Milk\nlittle by little.
56	If you’re feeling comatose, it’s time for a\nKomala Coffee. The flavor’s still a work in\r\nprogress, though.\c\nThe water we get up here on the mountain is\ncold, so it’s hard to get the flavor right.
57	Did you know the “-ade” part of Lemonade\noriginally comes from the Kalos region?
58	This Tapu Cocoa has been prepared with\nplenty of Moomoo Milk to give it the richest\r\nflavor possible.
59	Drinking Roserade Tea up here near the stars...\nIsn’t the thought of it delicious?
60	This is a popular snack in Lumiose City in the\nKalos region.
61	This candy bar is a specialty from Mahogany\nTown in the Johto region.
62	This ice cream is a specialty from Castelia City\nin the Unova region.
63	This is authentic food from Eterna City in the\nSinnoh region.
64	This snack is a specialty of Shalour City in the\nKalos region.
65	These cookies are a specialty from Lavaridge\nTown in the Hoenn region.
66	This chocolate is just ridiculously sweet.
67	You’re limited to one per day, but have a tea\nbiscuit on us.
68	We’d like to offer your Pokémon something on\nthe house.
69	Poké Beans are a specialty in Alola, and\nPokémon love to eat them!\c\nFeed them to your Pokémon in Pokémon\nRefresh, and they’ll become more affectionate!
70	By the way, do you give your\nPokémon nicknames?\c\nYou know, no one can change those names\nbesides the Trainer who gave them to\r\nthe Pokémon.\c\nIf you trade a Pokémon away, it will always\nkeep the nickname you gave it.\c\nYou better think long and hard about what\nnicknames to give your Pokémon.
71	By the way, are you saving your progress?\c\nIt can be kind of a pain to save your progress\nsometimes.\c\nIt is important, though, so do try to save often.
72	By the way, are you going to Festival Plaza?\nYou can connect with other Trainers anytime!\c\nThere’s an exclamation symbol that lets you\nknow when events are going on, too.
73	By the way, are you going to the Poké Pelago?\c\nMy Pokémon are spending their days on an\nisland far away from me.\c\nI hope they’re having a good time out there...
74	By the way, are you using the Poké Finder?\c\nIt lets you capture all your\nunforgettable moments.\c\nIt’s so lovely that you can save all your precious\nmemories forever.
75	By the way, are you using Pokémon Refresh?\c\nWhen I catch new Pokémon, I make sure to\ntake really good care of them.\c\nIt bothers me when they get dirty in battles.\nI spend all my downtime taking care of them.
76	By the way, are you riding Stoutland?\c\nYou can find all kinds of stuff when you’re\nriding that Pokémon.\c\nI get so into it when I ride Stoutland that I\ncompletely lose track of time.
77	By the way, are you watching Battle Videos?\c\nI like battling, so I’m hooked on taking and\nwatching videos.\c\nI’ve stayed up all night doing it and been late to\nwork here before!
78	By the way, are you checking out your\nTrainer Passport?\c\nI get a bit wistful when I look at all the stamps\nI’ve gotten in mine.\c\nI guess I’m just the sentimental type.
79	By the way, are you using\nQuick Link?\c\nWhen you’ve got too many friends around, you\nmight not know who you’ll connect with.\c\nYou really can connect quickly, though, so it’s\nstill really convenient.
80	By the way, are you visiting the\nPokémon Nursery?\c\nWhen you drop off a male Pokémon and a female\nPokémon who get along well there for a while,\r\napparently sometimes you’ll find an Egg.
81	By the way, are you gathering Poké Beans?\c\nPeople give them to Pokémon or roast them\nand use them as coffee beans.\c\nThat’s a foodstuff that has a long history here\nin Alola.\c\nApparently the Poké Beans you can get from\nMohn’s Poké Pelago are the best these days.
82	When you get to be my age, it really makes you\nthink about things.\c\nThey say time is money, but time itself is\nactually really important.\c\nI mean, you can never buy more time for\nyourself with money, right?\c\nThe present is truly a present. Once it’s gone,\nyou can never get it back.
83	The reason I run a café is because everybody’s\nalways rushing around and busy these days.\c\nI hope people can come here and relax, even if\nit’s just for a little while.
84	These days you can easily communicate with\npeople all over the world.\c\nKeep in mind that there are time differences in\nthe world, though.\c\nWhat I mean to say is that it isn’t necessarily\nthe same time for you and whatever Trainer\r\nyou’re communicating with.\c\nDepending on what time you’re trying to\ncommunicate with other Trainers, you might find\r\nit easier to connect to Trainers from a\r\ncertain country.
85	Once time has passed you by, it will never come\nback. And no one is selling more time\r\nanywhere, either.\c\nThat’s what makes time so important for all\nof us.\c\nWhen you’re late for an appointment, it’s like\nyou’re stealing the other person’s time.\c\nI was often late for dates with my wife, so she\nused to give me an earful!
86	Time is the same for everyone.\c\nWhether you’re outside playing or laying around\nsleeping, time just keeps on flowing.\c\nHow you spend it is up to you. Remember that\ntime you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.
87	Vehicles sure are convenient.\c\nYou can get to where you’re going a whole lot\nfaster than if you had to walk everywhere.\c\nSo by convenient, I mean that they’ll save you a\nlot of time.

11	I think this stone must belong to you.
12	Please...\c\nDon’t tell anyone about this...\nAbout seeing Nebby...\c\nIt’s...it’s a secret, OK?
13	Come on. Into the bag, Nebby.
14	Pew...
15	Um...
16	I’m worried we might get attacked again by\nsome wild Pokémon or...or something.\c\nI know it’s too much for me to ask it, but...\nDo you think you could see us back to town?

9	Woo!\nThat’s something you don’t hear every day![VAR 0114(0005)]

20	Let me see... So we open the X Menu by tapping\n and then select Save...\c\nAnd that’s how we can save our progress to\ncontinue again at any time, right?
21	It’s important to save your memories!\c\nYou can save them by jotting them down so\nthat you don’t forget what you’ve done.
22	Didja know? When a Rockruff really likes you,\nit rubs against you with the stones on its neck!\r\nBut...it does kinda hurt...
23	Little Hau is a sweet one, eh?\nNothing like his fearsome granddad, Hala!
24	If you treat your Pokémon wrong, the guardian\ndeity will strike you down with lightning!\r\nBut the children all laugh when I tell them that.
25	Both sides’ Pokémon will give it their all!
26	Pokémon have been there for me from the\nday I was born.\c\nI’d guess that Pokémon will keep being there\nfor me my whole life!
27	That Hau is the kahuna’s own grandson.\c\nBoy, I might just get my hopes up for this battle.\nI hope it’ll be a good one!
28	The tall grass is like a treasure trove, full of\nall kinds of Pokémon just waiting to be found!

7	But if your Pokémon get all tuckered out\nby fighting for you, just head home for a bit.\r\nIf you ask your mom, I’m sure she’ll let you and\r\nyour whole team rest up at home.\c\nOr you could use some Potions![VAR 0114(0005)]
8	Here’re some Poké Balls and Potions to get you\nstarted out.[VAR 0114(0005)]
9	Why don’t you have a little adventure of your\nown on the way to Iki Town, yeah?\c\nTake good care of [VAR 0100(0000)],\n[VAR 0101(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

9	Could it be?![VAR 0114(0008)]

11	You were rescued by Tapu Koko at the bridge—\nisn’t that what I heard, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0008)]
12	Yeah, it rescued me
13	That’s when I got that stone
14	So it even deigned to give you a stone...\c\nPerhaps you are here in Alola, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nbecause this is where you are meant to be.\c\nAllow me to borrow this stone for now.\c\nFret not! I’ll return it to you tomorrow evening.[VAR 0114(0008)]

10	So you two will be taking part in the battle?\c\nI don’t like seeing Pokémon fight one another,\nsince they so often end up getting hurt...\c\nBut it seems like this is an important event, so\nI’ll be sure to watch you both.[VAR 0114(0006)]
11	[~ 11]
12	Your Pokémon have fought for you, so show\nthem the same care in return, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nAllow me to heal them for you this time.[VAR 0114(0008)]

3	May this Pokémon battle be an offering to\nour island’s guardian deity—Tapu Koko![VAR 0114(0008)]
4	Before you stands Hau—grandson\nto the kahuna.[VAR 0114(0008)]
5	Before him stands [VAR 0100(0000)]—\none who has met with Tapu Koko.[VAR 0114(0008)]
6	What?!
7	What a curious little thing Tapu Koko is!\nHah, that’s just typical of it!
8	[VAR 0101(0001)]!\nTake care of my little [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
9	As long as we both have a good time,\nthen I think we can call it a great battle, eh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
10	[VAR 0100(0000)]! Hau!\nBring forth the power of your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0008)]

16	Ko-ko-kooo!
17	Ho! You heard it yourself!\nTapu Koko’s song of approval.[VAR 0114(0008)]
18	Oh, I nearly forgot! I think it is time you take\nthis, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
19	Your [VAR FF00(0001)]Z-Ring[VAR FF00(0000)], a mysterious armband that\ncan draw out the power that lies deep\r\nwithin Pokémon...\c\nIt can bring forth their [VAR FF00(0001)]Z-Power[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
20	You slipped the Z-Ring onto your wrist!
21	We kahunas can make them by refining stones\nlike the Sparkling Stone that you received from\r\nTapu Koko.[VAR 0114(0008)]
22	Although until you collect more Z-Crystals\nduring your island challenge, you will not be able\r\nto draw out the Z-Power of your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0008)]
23	And yet you have already received that\nSparkling Stone...\c\nIt seems Tapu Koko took quite a liking to you...\nor perhaps it has a mission for you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
24	In other words, it’s time for you to get out there\nand start your [VAR FF00(0001)]island challenge[VAR FF00(0000)]!\c\nIf you visit every island, maybe you’ll figure out\nwhat that mission is.[VAR 0114(0005)]
25	The island challenge?
26	Every island?
27	Four islands![VAR 0114(0005)]
28	You’ll travel to each of the four islands here\nin the Alola region.\c\nThe island challenge is about aiming to be the\nstrongest Trainer—\r\nthe [VAR FF00(0001)]island challenge champion[VAR FF00(0000)]. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
29	Sounds great, right?\nI can’t wait to have a real adventure![VAR 0114(0007)]
30	I’ll explain about the island challenge later![VAR 0114(0005)]

4	It saved you as well, didn’t it?\nAnd left you with that sparkling stone...\r\neven though you’re a stranger to this place.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	You know, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nit did save your life, too.\c\nAnd it even gifted you that sparkling stone...\neven though you’re a stranger to this place.[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Suppose it’s time we get you kids home, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
7	Then I suppose this is good-bye...[VAR 0114(0006)]

1	Mrawr!
2	Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You’re back already?\nI thought you’d want to stay in Iki Town longer...[VAR 0114(0004)]
3	Especially right after that great battle!\nOoh, I was just captivated to see my own [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl\r\nfighting in such perfect sync with h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser Pokémon![VAR 0114(0004)]
4	Maybe it would be a good idea for you to try\nthat island challenge thing...\c\nIt’s something you can only do in Alola, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
5	But right now I’ve got a date with my bed.\nI danced my feet off at that festival!\r\nNight-night, sweetie. You get some sleep, too![VAR 0114(0004)]

4	If it’s Kukui, he’ll probably let himself in without\neven waiting for us to open the door![VAR 0114(0004)]
5	Mrowr.
6	[~ 6]
58
0	Oh. Um...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	The professor said...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	“Hey there, Lillie!\nBring me that great new Trainer. Woo!”[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	So I’m here to show you the way to his Pokémon\nlab, if you’ll come with me.[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	It’s, um... It’s this way.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
6	Here. A little pocket money for you.\nDon’t go wasting it on anything too silly![VAR 0114(0004)]
7	Oh! Well done, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou’re already making friends, aren’t you?\r\nAnd what a cute little friend you’ve found!\c\nI knew Alola would be a great place for us.\nWe just keep meeting wonderful people here![VAR 0114(0004)]
8	M-me? Well, thank you...\c\nMy name is Lillie.\nIt’s very nice to meet you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	Looks like it’s finally your time to shine, sweetie!\c\nEnjoy yourself out there with [VAR 0101(0001)].\nAnd don’t be gone too long![VAR 0114(0004)]
10	You...have a very nice mother, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
11	We should get going.\nI’ll show you to the Pokémon Research Lab.[VAR 0114(0006)]
59
0	You can only reach the professor’s lab by\ntreading through the tall grass here.\c\nHe says he can research moves better when\nhe is so surrounded by Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Since I’m not a Trainer, though, I have to rely on\nusing Repels all the time.\c\nYou do know that using Repel keeps Pokémon\nfrom attacking, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	A-and about Nebby...\c\nOh. I mean...Cosmog.\c\nCosmog seems to be a very rare Pokémon.\nIt came from far, far away.[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Pew!
4	It seems to have a very strange power...\c\nIt used that power to save me once when I was\nin danger.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	But some...other people want Cosmog for\nthemselves, to use that power.\c\nThat’s why only the professor and Kahuna Hala\nand other people I can trust know about it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Can you keep a secret?\c\nCan you not tell anyone else about Nebby\nor what happened on that bridge? Please...[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Not that way![VAR 0114(0006)]
60
0	Ahh...\nThere they go again...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	The Pokémon Research Lab has its own unique\ncharm, as I think you might agree.\c\nI’ve actually been, um, imposing on the\nprofessor here for the past three months.\c\nI’m not much of an assistant, but it’s the least\nI can do to pay him back for letting me stay.[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Maybe I’d be more help if I were a real Pokémon\nTrainer, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Raaaa-oooooohhh! Raff ruff!
4	Oh yeah, Rockruff! Let’s go!\nGive it everything you’ve got!\r\nMy body is ready. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
5	The professor...\c\nHe never stops researching moves.\nNot even...inside the lab itself.[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Looks like we’ll have to patch the roof again...[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	And I had just washed his lab coat and finally\ngotten it clean, too. Now it’ll be in shreds...\r\nand I’m no good at mending clothes...\r\nso he’ll just have to buy another new one...[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	We should probably go in before he does\nany more damage...[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	Please don’t wander off![VAR 0114(0006)]
10	[~ 10]
11	[~ 11]

1	Of course. However I can be a help...\nI am supposed to be your assistant, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Rockruff’s moves were just so stylin’, and I was\nmaking good progress with my research.\c\nSay, [VAR 0100(0000)], lemme see your Pokédex\nfor a second, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
3	So what do you think of the place?\nNot bad, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
4	But that’s not why I called you here, eh?\nHere! It finally arrived![VAR 0114(0005)]
5	“It”...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	What’s wrong, Lillie? Don’t make me do all\nthe talking![VAR 0114(0005)]
7	See, there’s this Pokémon inside your Pokédex\ncalled Rotom...[VAR 0114(0005)]
8	Really?
9	Rotom?
10	Oh, I can tell you about Rotom.\c\nIt is a peculiar Pokémon, with a body made up\nof something like electricity.\r\nIt can take up residence in machines.[VAR 0114(0006)]
11	Yeah, buddy! And to put that crazy skill of\nRotom’s to work...
12	It’s the next generation of Pokédexes, but it’s\nonly complete once Rotom has gone into this\r\nbody specially developed for it!
13	A whole new way for people and Pokémon\nto communicate. Woo!\c\nAnd there’s only a few of these beauties out in\nthe world so far!
14	And now if I power up your Pokédex with the\nparts that I just got in...[VAR 0114(0005)]
15	Kzzzt!
16	Hey now! Sorry ’bout that, Rotom.\nGuess I surprised you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
17	Zzzt?
18	Rotom!\c\nHere, boy! I powered up your favorite ’Dex!\c\nGive [VAR 0100(0000)] here a Helping\nHand, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
19	Kzzzttt!!
20	See, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nNow Rotom can talk right to you!\c\nFrom what I can tell, yeah, it looks like Rotom\nhas taken a liking to you![VAR 0114(0005)]
21	[~ 21]
22	And this will help how exactly?[VAR 0114(0006)]
23	[VAR 0100(0000)] hasn’t been here in Alola too\nlong yet.\c\nSo I decided to give h[VAR 1100(0000,0202)]imer this special Rotom Dex\nto help h[VAR 1100(0000,0202)]imer navigate around.[VAR 0114(0005)]
24	Thank you very much
25	Nice to meet you, Rotom!
26	You can see where you’re headed just by\nlooking at Rotom, and if you give it a little tap,\r\nyou can even check out the [VAR FF00(0001)]Town Map[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
27	A-lo-la![VAR 0114(0007)]
28	The salty breeze sang to me and brought me\nhere to you![VAR 0114(0007)]
29	Whoa-ho-ho![VAR 0114(0007)]
30	Is that a loft?! That’s awesome![VAR 0114(0007)]
31	No, it’s not! It’s private!\c\nThe professor has been kind enough to let me\nuse it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
32	If you see a person or a Pokémon\nwho needs help, you just help them...\r\nRight, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Hau?[VAR 0114(0005)]
33	And that’s why I’m letting Lillie stay up there\nin the loft.[VAR 0114(0005)]

7	So, [VAR 0100(0000)], I’m leaving this Rotom Dex\nin your hands!\c\nRotom, you look after [VAR 0100(0000)], yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
8	So that’s the Rotom Dex, eh?\nIt’s kinda cute.[VAR 0114(0007)]
9	All right, there are some important things you\nneed to know about the [VAR FF00(0001)]island challenge[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0005)]
10	The island challenge is your chance to become\nthe strongest Trainer around—the [VAR FF00(0001)]island[VAR FF00(0000)]\r\n[VAR FF00(0001)]challenge champion[VAR FF00(0000)]. Woo!\c\nIt’s a great adventure for you and your Pokémon\nto go on together![VAR 0114(0005)]
11	There are four main islands that make up Alola,\nand a kahuna for each one of them.\c\nIf you wish to be recognized by the kahunas as\nworthy, it’s said you must clear [VAR FF00(0001)]seven trials[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
12	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI want you and [VAR 0101(0001)] to get out there\nand give it a shot!\c\nYou were able to fully use your Pokémon’s\nmoves in your very first battle.\c\nI think you must have a talent for drawing out\nPokémon’s strengths, yeah.[VAR 0114(0005)]
13	Then yeah, I’ll do it!
14	Um...I’m not really sure...
15	Come on!\nYou’ve gotta do it![VAR 0114(0007)]
16	You did just come to Alola, yeah, so I guess it’s\nhard for you to relate to our customs, huh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
17	But as someone who’s dedicated my life to\nstudying Pokémon moves, I really want to see\c\nyou out there meeting all kinds of Pokémon on\nyour island challenge.\c\nC’mon and give it a shot, cousin![VAR 0114(0005)]
18	Oh yeah! As someone who’s dedicated my life\nto studying Pokémon moves, I really want to see\c\nyou out there meeting all kinds of Pokémon on\nyour island challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
19	Here! Everybody on the island challenge gets\none of these island challenge amulets.[VAR 0114(0005)]
20	I got one from my gramps, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
21	All right then, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You too, Hau!\nGet a move on![VAR 0114(0005)]
22	OK!
23	What?
24	To the Trainers’ School![VAR 0114(0005)]
25	You’ve gotta learn the basics of being a\nPokémon Trainer through Pokémon battling.\c\nIt’s a long road to becoming the island challenge\nchampion, and the Trainers’ School is the\r\nfirst step![VAR 0114(0005)]
26	What about you, Hau?[VAR 0114(0005)]
27	I’m good. I just wanna play with my Pokémon!\nI mean, uh, train with them. Right![VAR 0114(0007)]
28	The island challenge...\c\nSo this is how the people of Alola connect with\nthe world around them.[VAR 0114(0006)]
29	And the way that you connected so quickly\nwith [VAR 0101(0001)] and Rotom, too, even\r\nthough you just met...\c\nEven Nebby likes you! I guess there’s something\nabout you that makes Pokémon feel comfortable\r\nwhen they’re by your side.[VAR 0114(0006)]
30	Lillie!\nYou take care of [VAR 0100(0000)], yeah?\c\nUntil [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she gets used to Rotom, help h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer find h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\nway around![VAR 0114(0005)]
31	[~ 31]

1	It’s amazing, isn’t it?\c\nI can’t stand seeing Pokémon in pain...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	You can also deposit Pokémon in the PC here\nor take them out.[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	And at the Poké Mart you can buy all kinds of\nitems that should help you during your trials.\c\nI’d take a look, if I were you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Over there is the café area.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	I like to relax there sometimes with a frosty\nglass of Moomoo Milk.[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	I read something in a travel guide about\nAlola once...\c\nApparently each Pokémon Center in Alola offers\na different selection of drinks.\r\nI wonder how they pick what to serve?[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	The cafés may also offer more than just drinks.\c\nI’ve heard they also sell special treats and that\nsometimes the staff have tips for trial-goers.[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	Pew!
9	We should head to the Trainers’ School next.\c\nBut have your Pokémon taken care of first if\nyou think that they need a little aid.[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	[~ 10]
65
0	Here we are.\nYou see, the Trainers’ School is...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	It’s a...a...\nWhat in the world?![VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Well, it looks like we won’t be going that way\nanytime soon, thanks to Tauros there...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	But we were only planning to go as far as\nthe Trainers’ School anyway.[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	We’ll just leave that for someone else to deal\nwith. Come. Follow me.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	Moo-aaarrr!
66
0	Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI must’ve passed you two somehow, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
1	But welcome to the Trainers’ School, the place\nto learn how to be a Pokémon Trainer![VAR 0114(0005)]
2	[~ 2]
3	[~ 3]
4	Professor Kukui!\nIs this the child you told me about?
5	Yeah. Put h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer through the wringer, Teach![VAR 0114(0005)]
6	Four Trainers![VAR 0114(0005)]
7	You’ve got to beat four Pokémon Trainers here\nat the school, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nThe experience will surely help you and your\nPokémon grow stronger, yeah.\c\nActually... Speaking of experience, why don’t\nyou take this.[VAR 0114(0005)]
8	If you keep that Exp. Share on, yeah,\nall the Pokémon on your team can get\r\nExp. Points from battle.[VAR 0114(0005)]
9	The Trainers who will take part in this lesson\nmay be inside or outside the school.
10	You may also want to visit our classrooms.\nYou’ll be sure to learn a lot.
11	[~ 11]
12	[~ 12]
13	All right. Let the lesson begin!
14	She may not look all that tough, but that teach\ntrains her kids right!\r\nOne of her students is even a captain![VAR 0114(0005)]
15	If you want a bit of advice from me, here’s\nsomething that might help.\c\nOnce you’ve fought a species of Pokémon once,\nyou can easily see what types of moves will\r\nwork best on it in your next battle.[VAR 0114(0005)]
16	Wandering about in the tall grass to meet\nlots of different Pokémon’ll help with that!\r\nBattle all the time, oh yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
17	Seeing a Pokémon in pain makes my own heart\nseem to ache.\c\nYou can come talk to me anytime that you want\nyour team’s health restored. I’m happy to help.[VAR 0114(0006)]
18	Let me take care of poor [VAR 0101(0001)], OK?[VAR 0114(0006)]
19	Please try not to push your Pokémon too hard...\nUm...I mean...if you don’t mind...[VAR 0114(0006)]

0	Boy, you’re awful close!
1	Stand so close and I’ll wanna battle you.\nIs that what you want? Huh? Is it?
2	You sure? I heard that you’re supposed to\nbeat us as some kinda lesson or something.
3	Then I’ll show you how I like to fight...\nup close and personal!
4	Your style of battle...\nIt’s pretty great, you know?
5	Oooh, so close!\nIt makes me want to battle!
6	You know, as a Trainer you can feel a lot closer\nto someone after battling them.\c\nBut how close you have to get to a Trainer\nbefore they challenge you to a battle can\r\ndepend on what kind of Trainer they are!
7	You can tell me anytime that you want your\nteam’s health restored, and I’ll help you.\c\nSeeing a Pokémon in pain makes my own heart\nseem to ache...[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	Let me take care of poor [VAR 0101(0001)], OK?[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	Please try not to push your Pokémon too hard...\nUm...I mean...if you don’t mind...[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	I’ll teach you the tactics that I learned\nhere at school...by beating you with them!
11	Poisoning an opponent will slowly drain its HP.\nParalyzing ’em can prevent its attacks.\c\nPokémon moves can have all kinds of effects,\nso watch out for them!
12	I’ve been waiting here for you because the\nteacher told me to.\c\nIf you beat my Pokémon, I’ll give you a simple\nbut very important lesson.
13	If you use items or moves to boost your team’s\nstats, you can increase how much damage your\r\nPokémon deal and lessen how much they take.\c\nIf you ever want to be a Pokémon champion,\nthen that’s a total basic. You got that?
14	You wanna know why I’m standing here?\nBecause I’m the strongest, that’s why!\c\nI won’t even bother battling you unless you can\nbeat everyone else here!
15	You wanna know why I wanna be strongest?\nBecause it’s cool to be strong, duh!
16	Ahh... Now that wasn’t cool at all...\nMaybe I should aim for being pretty instead?
17	But fine! Whatever!\c\nI can admit it when I’m beat.\nI’ll give you a reward even.\r\nTake this Technical Machine!
18	OK. First thing to know about TMs.\c\nTechnical Machines teach new techniques.\nThey’ll give your Pokémon a new move in a flash.\c\nBut if your Pokémon can’t learn the move in a\nTM, then too bad. You are up the creek, pal.\c\nSecond thing to know about TMs.\c\nYou can use a TM as many times as you want,\non as many different Pokémon as you want.\c\nThey don’t wear out or get used up.\nPretty nice gift from me, huh?
19	Oh, that’s the school bell.[VAR 0114(0006)]
20	Attention, all students...\c\nWould [VAR 0100(0000)] please come to the\noffice on 2F?\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)] to the 2F office, please.
21	What terrible thing did you do to get called to\nthe office so soon?[VAR 0114(0006)]
22	Nothing!
23	Well...
24	That’s what you say...[VAR 0114(0006)]
25	So you did do something?![VAR 0114(0006)]
26	[~ 26]
27	[~ 27]
28	[~ 28]
68
0	[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI can’t believe that you...
1	beat all of my students! Fantastic!
2	After seeing such a performance, I think I’d like\nto battle you myself!\c\nWhat do you say?\nAre you ready to take me on?
3	As a teacher, I’ve got to see for myself what\nyou did to beat four of my students!
4	You must be joking!\c\nYou do know how much experience you could\ngain from battling me, right?
5	Nice! Maybe you’d like to take over as teacher\nhere for me!
6	All joking aside, though, I do want you to take\nthese from me...\c\nIt’s a little reward for beating me.
7	They’re Great Balls. Great Balls are better at\ncatching Pokémon than normal Poké Balls.
8	Know your Pokémon and know their moves.\nThose are the basics of being a Trainer![VAR 0114(0005)]
9	How about it?[VAR 0114(0005)]
69
0	Greetings!\n[VAR FF00(0001)]Captain[VAR FF00(0000)] Ilima here.[VAR 0114(000C)]

2	This is [VAR 0100(0000)], who moved here to\nAlola from the Kanto region.\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s got a real sense for how to use moves,\nand I think [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she’s gonna go far as a Trainer, yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	I see!\nThen welcome, newcomer.\c\nI look forward to seeing the brilliance of your\nmoves in my [VAR FF00(0001)]trial[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
4	Indeed! We captains are the ones who conduct\nthe trials you will face on your way to\r\nchallenging the island kahuna.[VAR 0114(000C)]
5	My trial is held in Verdant Cavern.\nThe trial of Captain Ilima.[VAR 0114(000C)]
6	You can find Pokémon living everywhere, even\nin the patches of tall grass in Hau’oli City.\c\nPerhaps you’ll want to fill out your team a bit\nbefore attempting my trial?[VAR 0114(000C)]
7	I sincerely look forward to your challenge.[VAR 0114(000C)]
8	Oh yeah!
9	I reported to the folks upstairs about that\nTauros blocking the road out front again.
10	That guy’s Tauros is pretty much a celebrity\nhere on Melemele, you know?[VAR 0114(0005)]
11	Well, I guess it’s time that we dismiss you from\nschool, [VAR 0100(0000)].

1	You know...\nI was really impressed seeing how you battled\r\nwith your Pokémon at the Trainers’ School...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	And even back when you weren’t yet a Pokémon\nTrainer, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\r\nyou were able to save Nebby...\c\nYou were chosen by your Pokémon so quickly...\nI understand why now.[VAR 0114(0006)]

1	Ho! If it isn’t Lillie and [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nSorry for scaring you, friend.\nI guess it’s time I get old Tauros back home.[VAR 0114(0008)]
2	Oh! But why don’t you give him a little pat first,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0008)]
3	Bwoh!
4	Ha ha ha! You see that? This rascal already\nloves you!\c\nPokémon become happier when we show them\nsome [VAR FF00(0001)]care[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
5	Wa ha ha! Oh the places you’ll go, child!\c\nAnd as you do, you will surely meet more\nPokémon and people who will enrich your life.[VAR 0114(0008)]
6	The kahunas sure are something, eh?\nAble to calm a raging Pokémon without even\r\nneeding to battle... Now that’s something!\c\nI mean, I like Tauros plenty and all...\c\nbut it is pretty scary! I don’t want to ride on it![VAR 0114(0007)]
7	So where are you two off to now?[VAR 0114(0007)]
8	I was thinking I should show [VAR 0100(0000)]\naround Hau’oli City a bit.[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	Nice idea!\nYou’re always on top of things, Lillie!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)] just got here to Alola, huh?\c\nThen let me tag along, too!\nI wanna go get something good to eat![VAR 0114(0007)]
10	All right. Let’s all go together.[VAR 0114(0006)]
11	Then what’re we waiting for!\nThis way! Come on![VAR 0114(0007)]
12	Oh, Hau...\c\nI guess we should go catch up with him before\nhe gets too far, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nHau’oli City is the biggest city in all Alola.[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	Oh, Tauros...\c\nWell, at least it’s nice that the Pokémon in Alola\nare so lively and such a part of everyday life.[VAR 0114(0006)]

0	Beach time! Yeaaahhh![VAR 0114(0007)]
74
0	Alola!\c\nYou here on vacation, young friend?\nOr are you perhaps a trial-goer?
1	I guess I’m a trial-goer
2	I’m just sightseeing
3	Well, you are most welcome to Alola either way!\nIn fact, why don’t you take this?
4	Enjoy Hau’oli! Enjoy Alola!\nAnd most of all, enjoy Pokémon!
5	Hey, you...\c\nYou’ve come to Alola from someplace far off,\nhaven’t you? I can tell!
6	Then let me teach you the proper way to greet\nsomeone in Alola!
7	Alola!\c\nYou give it a try, too! Just like that: “Alola!”\nYou’ll make more friends if you say it!
75
0	He-e-ey! [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI thought I recognized the sound of those feet![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	So what do you think? Hau’oli is something, eh?\nAlola’s gotta be the best place ever to live![VAR 0114(0007)]
2	Oh yeah![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Come in here with me.\nI’ve got a good idea of something you could do![VAR 0114(0007)]
76
0	Hey, miss. Is it true that you can get some kinda\nspecial gift if you have a Rotom Dex?[VAR 0114(0007)]
1	My goodness, you get the news fast!\c\nHardly anyone has a Rotom Dex, but it is true\nthat we have a special item to go with it.\c\nIt’s our very own [VAR FF00(0001)]Poké Finder[VAR FF00(0000)]! Here you go!
2	Awesome![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Isn’t that awesome, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nYou got a Poké Finder![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	So, like, what’s a Poké Finder?[VAR 0114(0007)]
5	The Poké Finder is a tool that lets you take\nphotos of Pokémon.\c\nRotom will help point out places where you’ll\nbe able to take photos, too.\c\nHere, I’ll read you the instruction manual.\c\n“Tap on Rotom or press .”\nYup, that’s all it says. Quite simple, isn’t it?
6	Man, that Rotom Dex is cool!\c\nIt’s like a whole nother partner, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI mean, on top of your Pokémon partner![VAR 0114(0007)]
7	Oh, but I guess since it’s Rotom inside...\nit pretty much is a Pokémon partner?\c\nEither way, you’re pretty darn lucky.\nMeet you outside when you’re done in here![VAR 0114(0007)]
8	The photos you can snap of Pokémon with a\nPoké Finder...\c\nThey are simply too cute to resist!
9	[~ 9]
10	[~ 10]

77
0	Oh. [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nTell me, do you pick out all your own clothes?[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Of course I do
2	My mom does it
3	Of course...\nMost people do, don’t they...[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Oh, your mother must have a great sense of\nstyle then. I love the way that you dress.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	I...I’ve always just worn the clothes that my\nmother wanted me to wear.\c\nI don’t really know what kind of thing would\nsuit me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Oh! But that’s not why I stopped you.\nI meant to give you th[VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]isese, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI received [VAR 1100(00FF,0402)]itthem inside the apparel shop here.[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	I didn’t even buy anything, but they said I was\nthe 99,999th customer to visit the store...\c\nBut I already have the same [VAR 1100(00FF,0303)]oneset, so I thought\nthat maybe you might...want [VAR 1100(00FF,0402)]itthem?[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	It looks like we have something in common now,\ndon’t we, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Hee...[VAR 0114(0006)]
78
0	Yo, Trainer. Look what you’ve got!
1	You lucky kid. If you’ve got a Poké Finder, then\nI guess I’ll give you a little tip.
2	See that spot where the wall is cracked?\nThat’s a photo spot right there.
3	Look at that! Your Rotom there is trying to tell\nyou, too! Give him a tap!
4	You can’t just let a chance like this go by!\nCome on, fire up that Poké Finder!
5	Did you get a good shot?\c\nI hear it’s best to try to photograph Pokémon\nfrom the front, you know?
6	If you want to know more about the Poké Finder,\nwell, just keep on taking tons of pictures!
79
0	[VAR 0100(0000)], Hau...\nDid you visit the tourist bureau? How was it?[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	We got h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser Rotom Dex upgraded!\nNow it can take pictures, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
2	What a wonderful helper you are, Rotom![VAR 0114(0006)]
3	*flash*
4	Huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	Ahahaha!\nWhat was that for, Rotom?\c\nGo and put that little trickster back in your Bag,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], and follow me!\c\nEnough feasting for the eyes...\nIt’s time we take care of our stomachs![VAR 0114(0007)]
6	Maybe Rotom just wants to flaunt its new\ncamera function and take more photos...\c\nHave you thought about trying it out?\c\nI think I’ll go stop by the apparel shop to do\nsome shopping of my own...[VAR 0114(0006)]
80
0	I saw those [VAR FF00(0001)]Team Skull[VAR FF00(0000)] numskulls loitering\naround the Marina again.\r\nI reported it to the captain, of course.
1	This is what happens when young people have\nnothing to do and too much time on their hands!
2	What a bunch of useless thugs!\c\nAll they do is drag Trainers into battles they\ndon’t want and try to steal people’s Pokémon!
3	I heard they keep trying to sneak into the\ntrial site to steal Pokémon to sell...\r\nand that they fail every single time!
4	[~ 4]
81
0	Yo, yo, yo, check it!\c\nWhenever, wherever we meet you,\nTeam Skull don’t even greet you![VAR 0114(0030)]
1	So, Cap, just give up the Pokémon, yo.[VAR 0114(0033)]
2	Greetings. It’s me, Captain Ilima.[VAR 0114(000C)]
3	Oh! You, from the Trainers’ School!\nAlready made your way to Hau’oli, hmm?[VAR 0114(000C)]
4	What, what?! Why you trying to act hard when\nwe’re already hard as bone out here, homie?[VAR 0114(0031)]
5	Yo, let’s check these fools.[VAR 0114(0032)]
6	Oh my... How terrifying...[VAR 0114(000C)]
7	Only thieves steal people’s Pokémon. I won’t\nstand for it.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], wasn’t it?\nI’ll ask you to take care of that one.\r\nI’ll get rid of this one.[VAR 0114(000C)]
8	[~ 8]
9	[~ 9]
10	Yo, check how I change the game with my mad\nPokémon skills![VAR 0114(0032)]
11	No fair! I was playing a different game![VAR 0114(0032)]
12	Let’s get up out this port, B! Nobody has to\nknow about this!\c\nWe don’t need your wack Pokémon\nanyway, Ilima![VAR 0114(0031)]
13	Again? Oh my... How terrifying...[VAR 0114(000C)]
82
0	My thanks to you and your Pokémon.\c\nWhy don’t I heal your team to express\nmy gratitude?[VAR 0114(000C)]
1	I must admit, I’ve been wondering about you\nsince I saw you at the Trainers’ School...\c\nProfessor Kukui brought you along, and you\nand your Pokémon seemed to defeat our\r\nteacher so effortlessly!\c\nVery well then! Allow me to see if you’re ready\nfor my trial![VAR 0114(000C)]
2	Behold the magnificent Pokémon\nof the one and only Captain Ilima![VAR 0114(000C)]
3	Well then!\nI’ll wait until you are ready to take me on.[VAR 0114(000C)]
4	You—or should I say you and your Pokémon—\nmake quite the interesting team![VAR 0114(000C)]
5	I do hope you’ll come to Verdant Cavern and\nattempt the trial—the [VAR FF00(0001)]trial of Ilima[VAR FF00(0000)]!\c\nYou can get there from Route 2...\nThat Rotom Dex of yours will show you the way.[VAR 0114(000C)]
6	I bid you Alola![VAR 0114(000C)]
83
0	Oh! Wait for me, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Oh, I’m glad to see a familiar face.\nI always get lost so quickly...\c\nI can’t figure out the roads here...\nI can’t even buy my own clothes...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	But you...\c\nYou’re moving on to your first trial?\nYou’re going to Verdant Cavern?[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Pew!
4	I read something in an old book once. It said \nthat the island challenges were once a journey\r\nmade to prove yourself and gain the strength to\r\nbattle against the guardian deities of Alola.\c\nLike Tapu Koko...\c\nThe people in Iki Town said that Tapu Koko\nloves Pokémon battles, didn’t they?[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	If we could meet Tapu Koko once more, do you\nthink we would find the answer to why it saved\r\nyou and Nebby that day, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Pew?
7	[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nGood luck on your first trial.\nI will hope that it goes well for you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
84
0	Howzit, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nIf you’re looking for good eats, you’ve found ’em![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	Plus malasada make your Pokémon like you.\nAnd affectionate Pokémon are better in battle![VAR 0114(0007)]
2	Who could resist giving their Pokémon a few\nmalasada, eh? They’re just so cute![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Now that I’ve got some fuel in me, I wanna go\nright down to the Marina and scream out loud...\c\n“Watch me, Tutu!”\c\nNo...\c\n“Watch me, world!\nI’m gonna beat even my old gramps someday!”[VAR 0114(0007)]
85
0	Moo-aaarrr!
1	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou stand back.\c\nOld kahuna Hala will take care of this\nornery Tauros!\r\nWhy don’t you take a stroll through Hau’oli?[VAR 0114(0008)]
2	Hah![VAR 0114(0008)]
3	There! [VAR 0100(0000)], I’ve got this ornery\ncreature calmed again, for now.\c\nWant to try giving him a little pat again?\nThat’s the only way he’ll get used to you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
4	Moo?
5	Maybe old Tauros here can feel your love for\nPokémon. He sure seems happy to know you.\c\nAnd yet...\c\nIt still seems to me like Tauros wants to stretch\nhis legs on his own island challenge! Ha![VAR 0114(0008)]
6	What! You want to play tag, now?\nThe Melemele kahuna never loses, friend![VAR 0114(0008)]
86
0	Brrrr!
1	Delibird has hold of your Bag and won’t\nlet go...\c\nIt seems to want you to follow it into the\nBerry fields.
87
0	You got a lame bunch of Berries...\nNow Team Skull’s your adversaries!\c\nTakin’ Berries off your hands\nis just the start of our plans, yo![VAR 0114(0031)]
1	Let’s get Figy with it!\nWatch while I Nanab me some Berries![VAR 0114(0032)]
2	I’ll share my Berries for free with any Pokémon,\nbut you’ll not have a single one from me!
3	So, what? I’m lower than a Pokémon?!\nI already got self-esteem issues, man![VAR 0114(0031)]
4	And what are you looking at, huh?!\nHuh? Huh? HUH?\c\nYo, hold up, you’re—![VAR 0114(0031)]
5	You got a bone to pick with us, homie?\c\nYou and Cap may have beat us at the Marina,\nbut you won’t be so lucky if we get serious, yo![VAR 0114(0032)]
6	I appreciate your concern, child.\c\nBut these Team Skull punks do nothing but talk\nbig and act small.\c\nYou carry on with your island challenge.\nDon’t give them a moment’s notice.
7	Yo, we’re standing right here! At least act a\nlittle bit afraid or something, y’know?![VAR 0114(0031)]
8	Yo, you tryin’ to run away? We’re gonna hafta\ntake your Pokémon along with the Berries![VAR 0114(0032)]
9	[~ 9]
10	Yo, check out how hardheaded Team Skull\nGrunts can be![VAR 0114(0032)]
11	Yo, for real?!\nYou best stop trying to act hard, kid!\c\nYo, I’m so annoyed right now, homie! Let’s go\nmess with Ilima again![VAR 0114(0032)]
12	Aww yeah, let’s do it!\nVerdant Cavern is pretty close by anyway.\c\nAnd you!\c\nYou better listen to what my boy says\nand drill it into that thick skull of yours!\r\nFor real! You’d better not forget, numskull![VAR 0114(0031)]
13	Brrr!
88
0	Ho! You and that [VAR 0101(0000)] there did\nquite the number on him!\c\nAllow me to thank you for driving off those\nTeam Skull numskulls.
1	Oran Berries can restore some of a Pokémon’s\nHP for them.\c\nYou can feed a Berry to a Pokémon, or let one\nhold a Berry and they’ll eat it when they need it.
2	If you’re ever looking for more Berries,\nyou won’t have to look Berry hard!\c\nWa ha ha ha!\c\nBerries grow like...well, like weeds here in Alola,\nso feel free to pick up any you find!
89
0	Howzit, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nYour Pokémon doing all right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
1	Yeah, fine
2	Not so good...
3	Well, I know my team’s seen better days,\nthat’s for sure![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	Same here!\nMy team has seen better days, for sure.[VAR 0114(0007)]
5	Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nLet’s stop by the PMC![VAR 0114(0007)]
90
0	You know that Verdant Cavern place, right?\nI guess it’s kinda, like, sacred to Tapu Koko.[VAR 0114(0007)]
1	You aren’t even allowed to go into it unless\nyou’re on your island challenge.[VAR 0114(0007)]
2	Oh yeah! Almost forgot!\c\nI have something pretty amazing to share with\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You lucky thing![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Revives are solid items to have!\nIf your Pokémon faints in battle and can’t go on,\r\nthen a Revive will perk ’em right back up!\c\nBut you probably won’t find Revives here.\nDidja know that Poké Marts sometimes sell\r\ndifferent things? And not just that!\c\nThe two clerks at the counter even sell\ndifferent things from one another![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	I think I’ll get myself a treat at the café to\npump myself up before trying the first trial![VAR 0114(0007)]
5	Mmm, Pinap Juice! I love it![VAR 0114(0007)]
91
0	Greetings.\nCaptain Ilima here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
1	And my trial...[VAR 0114(000C)]
2	begins mere steps from here in Verdant Cavern![VAR 0114(000C)]
3	[~ 3]
4	Note that the Pokémon living within Verdant\nCavern are quite fierce.\c\nI wouldn’t venture in unless you’ve prepared\nsome Potions and so forth.[VAR 0114(000C)]
5	Through attempting the trials during the island\nchallenge, one can exceed his or her own limits.\r\n...That is what the Alolan people believe.[VAR 0114(000C)]
6	Once you enter Verdant Cavern, you will not be\nable to leave until you have completed the trial.\r\nAre you prepared for the trial?[VAR 0114(000C)]
7	I’ll be waiting for you![VAR 0114(000C)]
8	Please make your preparations. I’ll be waiting\nfor you![VAR 0114(000C)]
92
0	Let me formally welcome you to Verdant Cavern!\nI am your captain, Ilima.[VAR 0114(000C)]
1	Allow me to explain the basics of my trial.[VAR 0114(000C)]
2	What you should attempt to do is...[VAR 0114(000C)]
3	Defeat three of the Pokémon that lurk\nhere in their dens![VAR 0114(000C)]
4	Then reach the pedestal deep within the cave...\c\nand collect the [VAR FF00(0001)]Z-Crystal[VAR FF00(0000)] there![VAR 0114(000C)]
5	You’ll need to be completely in sync with your\nPokémon to succeed.[VAR 0114(000C)]
6	Grrrr!
7	Oh dear!\c\nAnd there’s one more thing I forgot to mention.[VAR 0114(000C)]
8	Many strong Pokémon make their home in this\ncave, but one stronger and more fearsome\r\nthan all the rest, known as a [VAR FF00(0001)]Totem Pokémon[VAR FF00(0000)],\r\nalso resides here!\c\nIt will be the greatest obstacle you face as you\nattempt to clear my trial![VAR 0114(000C)]
9	By the way, until you clear the trial, you will not \nbe able to catch Pokémon in Verdant Cavern.[VAR 0114(000C)]
10	This is but one of the seven trials you will face\nduring your island challenge.[VAR 0114(000C)]
11	And it begins now! The trial of Captain Ilima![VAR 0114(000C)]
12	Let the Verdant Cavern trial of Ilima...begin!
13	Not sure what to do?\nIt’s quite simple.\c\nDefeat the three Pokémon, reach the\npedestal at the back of the cave,\r\nand get the Z-Crystal.[VAR 0114(000C)]
14	Now all you need do is claim the Z-Crystal from\nthe pedestal![VAR 0114(000C)]
15	Ki-ki-ki-kiii!
16	The Totem [VAR 0101(0002)] is a formidable\nopponent for any Trainer to take on.\c\nIt is a Normal-type Pokémon, so perhaps you\nshould battle back with Fighting-type\r\nPokémon or moves![VAR 0114(000C)]
93
0	I’m a Trial Guide, here to help young boys and\ngirls attempting the island challenge.
1	Looks like there [VAR 1101(0000,0302)]isare [VAR 0200(0000)] more Pokémon for you\nand your team to prove yourself against.
2	Fantastic!\nYou proved your strength to all three Pokémon!\c\nThen go right ahead inside!
3	Going somewhere? The goal of the trial is\nto get the Z-Crystal, remember?
4	It’s pretty tough to even attempt the trial.\nAnd you managed to get a Z-Crystal and finish!\r\nYou’ll be a Trainer to keep an eye on!
5	Ooh, sorry, but I can’t let you through here till\nyou beat all three Pokémon you were asked to!
94
0	Yo, yo, yo![VAR 0114(0032)]
1	It’s your Berry thief boys, back...back again!\nRemember us?[VAR 0114(0031)]
2	Sure, I do
3	Sorry, who are you?
4	Whoa! Even though we look identical?\nThat’s pretty impressive, actually![VAR 0114(0031)]
5	Oh, I see...[VAR 0114(0032)]
6	Just ’cause we switched places, you can’t tell\nwho we are anymore?![VAR 0114(0032)]
7	Who cares about that anyway?!\c\nWe’re here to mess h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser trial up, yo![VAR 0114(0031)]
8	Oh yeah, that’s right! Yo, let’s get that\nPokémon, homie![VAR 0114(0032)]
9	What’s up with that?[VAR 0114(0031)]
10	For real, though?! I can’t get my skull around it!\nThis kid’s mad strong, yo![VAR 0114(0032)]
11	Naw, it ain’t even like that. This kid is straight\nup dangerous, homie![VAR 0114(0031)]
12	I don’t know, man...\nIsn’t this whole place trouble?![VAR 0114(0032)]
13	Yeah! It totally is, homie!\c\nI mean, that thing is so strong that regular\nPokémon don’t even wanna come out and battle![VAR 0114(0031)]
14	Yo, kid! You know there’s a mad strong\nPokémon lurking back here somewhere, right?\r\nI’d run if I were you.[VAR 0114(0032)]
15	Naw, we’re not going out like that!\nWe gotta get our revenge!\c\nGo stand over that den and catch that skulking\n[VAR 0101(0001)], yo![VAR 0114(0031)]
16	For real?! Fine!\nI got no bones to pick with you![VAR 0114(0032)]
17	Yo, you think maybe all these dens are, like,\nconnected or something?\c\nIf they are, and we park our bones right here,\nthen nobody’ll come out these holes, right?[VAR 0114(0032)]
18	Yo, yo, yo! Come on out!\c\nI’m gonna make you man enough...or, uh,\n’mon enough to take on that big ol’ boss inside![VAR 0114(0031)]
19	Yo, yo, yo, homie!\nYou giving up already?![VAR 0114(0032)]
20	Yo, I’m over this! I’m out![VAR 0114(0031)]
95
0	There is a small den here...\nWill you look inside it?
1	[~ 1]
2	There is nothing inside...
3	[~ 3]
4	[~ 4]
5	[~ 5]
6	[~ 6]
7	No-meeeeee!!
8	Buzzzafff!
9	Sarrr-reeeeee!
10	Scrrrr-am!
96
0	Yes, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nWould you like to give up so you can better\nprepare for my trial?\c\nKeep in mind you’ll have to start from the\nbeginning if you give up now, though![VAR 0114(000C)]
1	I see.\c\nUnfortunately, I’ll have to ask you to go make\nwhatever preparations you may need to\r\nand then come back to try again.[VAR 0114(000C)]
2	Good!\c\nThen go and defeat the three Pokémon.\c\nOnly then will you be able to claim the Z-Crystal\nwaiting in the final chamber of the cave![VAR 0114(000C)]
3	Yes, [VAR 0100(0000)]? I take it you would like\nto attempt my trial again?[VAR 0114(000C)]
4	Very well, let the trial begin![VAR 0114(000C)]
5	I see.\c\nUnfortunately, I’ll have to ask you to go make\nwhatever preparations you may need to\r\nand then come back to try again.[VAR 0114(000C)]
97
0	You feel a piercing gaze that seems to cut right\nthrough you...but from where?
1	Will you take the Z-Crystal from the pedestal?
98
0	[VAR 0101(0000)], the Totem Pokémon of\nVerdant Cavern, has appeared!
1	Thhhh!
2	Thhhh!
3	[VAR 0101(0000)] disappeared back into the\ncave somewhere...
4	You reached out to grab the Z-Crystal from\nthe pedestal!
99
0	What an incredible Trainer you are![VAR 0114(000C)]
1	For you to be able to defeat the Totem Pokémon\nthat I had trained up to such a powerful state...\r\nI don’t know what I can say![VAR 0114(000C)]
2	Working in harmony with your Pokémon, you\nhave cleared the trial of Ilima!\r\nYou’re a phenomenal Trainer![VAR 0114(000C)]
3	Congratulations, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThe Z-Crystal from the pedestal is yours now![VAR 0114(000C)]
100
0	You reached out to grab the Z-Crystal from\nthe pedestal!
1	You obtained a Normal-type Z-Crystal!\nThe Normalium Z is yours!
2	You placed the Normalium Z in your Bag’s\nZ-Crystals Pocket.
101
0	What you have just received is the Normal\nZ-Crystal![VAR 0114(000C)]
1	It is known as [VAR FF00(0001)]Normalium Z![VAR FF00(0000)][VAR 0114(000C)]
2	[~ 2]
3	Now if you let a Pokémon that can use a\nNormal-type move hold that...[VAR 0114(000C)]
4	and strike an elegant pose like this one...\c\nthen you will be able to strengthen a\nNormal-type move by unleashing Z-Power![VAR 0114(000C)]
5	Moving right along...[VAR 0114(000C)]
6	Ah, yes. First, there is one thing I forgot\nto mention.[VAR 0114(000C)]
7	The Totem Pokémon![VAR 0114(000C)]
8	In every locale where a captain holds his or\nher trials, you will encounter a particularly\r\nstrong Pokémon, like [VAR 0101(0001)] just now.[VAR 0114(000C)]
9	And during battles against such Pokémon, they\nmay [VAR FF00(0001)]summon allies [VAR FF00(0000)]to shore up their offense.\c\nIt’s not a tactic often seen in other regions.\c\nPerhaps Pokémon in Alola are simply more\ninclined to help one another?[VAR 0114(000C)]
10	Since you have managed to defeat the\nTotem Pokémon and proved yourself, you can\r\nnow try to catch any of the Pokémon you find\r\nhere in this cave.\c\nIn fact, have some Great Balls.[VAR 0114(000C)]
11	And here, let me see to your Pokémon after all\nof their hard work in there![VAR 0114(000C)]
12	If we’re done here, I have something interesting\nI’d like to show you. Come with me to Route 3.[VAR 0114(000C)]
102
0	Greetings.\nCaptain Ilima here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
1	As you travel around the islands of Alola, you\nwill find captains’ barricades here and there.[VAR 0114(000C)]
2	These barricades help mark areas where\nparticularly strong Pokémon can be found.\c\nAnyone can pass through them, of course, if\nthey are escorted by a strong Trainer.\c\nThose attempting the island challenge can pass\nthe barricades, as long as they clear the trials.[VAR 0114(000C)]
3	Are you ready?\c\nThen behold the power of a captain![VAR 0114(000C)]
4	Voila!\nYour world just got a little bigger.[VAR 0114(000C)]
5	I am the only captain here on Melemele Island,\nmeaning my trial is the only one here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
6	Now that you have cleared the trial, please\ninform our island kahuna, Hala![VAR 0114(000C)]
103
0	Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nOooh, looking at the expression on Ilima’s face,\nI’d say you cleared your first trial, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
1	Guess I better give you a little reward...\nTime to learn about [VAR FF00(0001)]Z-Power[VAR FF00(0000)]. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
2	Watch and learn, cousin![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	[~ 3]
4	[~ 4]
5	[~ 5]
6	[~ 6]
7	Phew! Z-Powers heap all of a Trainer’s feelings\nonto a Pokémon, yeah,\r\nwhich totally wears you out!\c\nUsing Z-Power once per battle\nis all a team can handle, yeah.[VAR 0114(0005)]
8	Oh, so is that why you’ve been looking so\nragged, Professor?[VAR 0114(000C)]
9	No! It’s like I was hit with Amnesia!\c\nI forgot that I lost Lillie somewhere on Route 3!\c\nThink you could spare some time to help me look\nfor her, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
10	I can go and have a look around the cave for\nyou, in case she wandered that way.[VAR 0114(000C)]
11	Thanks, cousin.\nLet’s split up and find her, yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
104
0	Nebby!\nNebby, come back![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Ah...\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Nebby ran off into the meadow here...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	And right after it got into so much trouble\non the bridge, too...\c\nWhat if a wild Pokémon attacks it?\nIt doesn’t have any moves it can use to battle![VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Here, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nLet me heal your Pokémon for you...[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	I always carry lots of Potions on me to keep\nNebby healthy.\c\nThat’s the best I can do, since I’m not a real\nTrainer or anything...[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Pew!
7	Oh, you![VAR 0114(0006)]
8	Pew?
9	Thank you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	And I should thank [VAR 0101(0001)], too.\nHere, let me at least do this...[VAR 0114(0006)]
11	You know, I read something interesting in a\nbook once...\c\nIt seems the Pokémon called Oricorio changes\nappearance by feeding on the nectar from\r\ndifferent types of flowers.\c\nIt’s not actually evolving but undergoing a\nso-called “form change.”\c\nIsn’t that interesting? I thought it was, anyway...[VAR 0114(0006)]
12	Pew!
13	Back into the bag, please, Nebby.\c\nI know there aren’t many people around to see\nyou here, but that’s hardly an excuse!\c\nAnd I guess we should be going now...\c\nThe professor will probably be worried after\nthe way we just disappeared on him...[VAR 0114(0006)]
105
0	Start off by selecting a compatible Z-Crystal\nfrom the Z-Crystals Pocket in your Bag, yeah!
1	Then use the Z-Crystal you chose\non a Pokémon!
2	Z-Crystals are [VAR FF00(0001)]compatible [VAR FF00(0000)]with a Pokémon if it\nknows a move of the same type as the crystal.
3	Have your Pokémon hold Z-Crystals, and you’ll\nbe able to use Z-Power in battles!
4	And don’t worry, you can use your Z-Crystals\nover and over on as many Pokémon as you want!
106
0	He-e-ey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nOh! And Lillie’s with you, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	What are you up to, Hau?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Just finished up my trial! Heh![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI wanna see if I really learned anything from my\ntrial. Let me battle you again![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	So you and me both beat that Totem Pokémon,\nhuh, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nLooks like we’re getting pretty strong!\c\nBut I wonder if I’ll ever really be able to beat my\ngramps at this rate...[VAR 0114(0007)]
5	Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nKnew I could count on you, yeah!\c\nThanks for tracking Lillie down for me![VAR 0114(0005)]
6	What’s this then?\nHau, you finished your first trial, too?\r\nI bet you used some stylin’ moves, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
7	Heh heh, right...[VAR 0114(0007)]
8	Hala’s probably rubbing his hands together in\nglee right about now, oh yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
9	What do you mean?[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	It’s all a part of the trials, yeah?\c\nAfter you clear one island’s trials, you gotta\nbattle that island’s kahuna![VAR 0114(0007)]
11	Taking on the island kahuna in battle is called\nthe [VAR FF00(0001)]grand trial[VAR FF00(0000)]!\c\nFor someone like me who’s researching Pokémon\nmoves, nothing could be better than the chance\r\nto see some more fierce Pokémon battles! Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
12	I don’t know about fierce...[VAR 0114(0007)]
13	I’ll be the judge of that!\nCome on! Back to Iki Town!\c\nCatch that Tailwind and blast through Route 3![VAR 0114(0005)]
14	[~ 14]
15	[~ 15]
16	It seems to me...that Trainers can always find\na path to happiness as long as they have their\r\nPokémon with them. It’s a very nice way to live.[VAR 0114(0006)]
107
0	I’m lookin’ forward to seeing what moves you\nand your Pokémon will pour your soul into...\r\nnow that you’ve gone and cleared your first\r\ntrial, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
1	It’s true... I’m not a Trainer, so I’m sure I don’t\nreally understand how hard it must have been...\r\nbut even I think it’s a great achievement.[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Pew!
3	Yes, yes... We all know how you feel!\nBut stay inside your bag, please![VAR 0114(0006)]
4	The Melemele kahuna is strong, cousin!\c\nHe’s a Trainer who can use [VAR FF00(0001)]Fighting-type[VAR FF00(0000)]\nPokémon to the fullest, yeah.\c\nMight not be a bad idea to work on those\nFlying- or Psychic-type moves![VAR 0114(0005)]
108
0	[~ 0]
1	Ho![VAR 0114(0008)]
2	I have been expecting you.\c\nAllow me to properly greet the young\nadventurers embarking on their island challenge.\c\nI am Hala, the kahuna of Melemele Island.[VAR 0114(0008)]
3	Shall we begin?\c\nThe final trial here on Melemele Island will be a\nPokémon battle against me, the kahuna!\c\nIt is known as the grand trial![VAR 0114(0008)]
4	Your spirit appears to be ready! However, your\nPokémon must also be healthy if they are to\r\nunleash their full power in battle![VAR 0114(0008)]
5	Yes! It seems that both you and your Pokémon\nare prepared to combine your mental and\r\nphysical strengths to unleash your full power![VAR 0114(0008)]
6	Well, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou have been entrusted with the\nSparkling Stone by Tapu Koko!\c\nNow show me you and your partner\n[VAR 0101(0001)]’s full power![VAR 0114(0008)]
7	Well, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou have been entrusted with the Sparkling\nStone by Tapu Koko!\c\nNow show me you and your partner\n[VAR 0101(0001)] and your team’s full power![VAR 0114(0008)]
8	Old Hala here will also be going all out!\nLet the grand trial begin![VAR 0114(0008)]
9	...Hmmph![VAR 0114(0008)]
10	The results come as no surprise to me.\c\nWhat a fine Trainer...and what fine Pokémon, too![VAR 0114(0008)]
11	Tapu Ko-ko-ko!
12	Ho! And our mighty Tapu Koko agrees![VAR 0114(0008)]
13	Hmmph! Perhaps Tapu Koko is hoping that a\nday may come when you will grow strong\r\nenough to battle it as well...[VAR 0114(0008)]
14	Accept this Z-Crystal! It allows Trainers to\nshare their power with their partner Pokémon![VAR 0114(0008)]
15	Observe, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIf you wish to use the Fighting-type Z-Power,\nmove your arm like this...\r\nthen bend your hips like this and pose![VAR 0114(0008)]
16	Now then, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWith this victory...\c\nyou have cleared all of the trials of Melemele\nIsland, the first of Alola’s islands!\c\nThe Melemele stamp is proof of\nyour accomplishments. With it, Pokémon up to\r\nLv. 35, even those you received in a trade,\r\nwill obey you![VAR 0114(0008)]
17	The moon in the daytime...\nThe sun at night...\c\nNow to see if you can pour your heart into\nsomething that cannot be seen but is very\r\nmuch real.\c\nAs you continue on your island challenge,\nconsider what makes up the people and\r\nPokémon that you meet: both what you\r\ncan see and what you cannot.\c\nYou will surely meet Tapu Koko again someday.[VAR 0114(0008)]
109
0	Moo-aaarrr!
1	Whoa there, Tauros![VAR 0114(0008)]
2	I’ve got an idea!\c\nHow about I set you up so you can ride my\nTauros whenever you’d like?\c\nNo reason why he shouldn’t get to enjoy the\nisland challenge, too![VAR 0114(0008)]
3	Moo-raaarrr!
4	I’ll take care of all the little things you’ll need in\norder to ride a Pokémon, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
5	You obtained a [VAR FF00(0001)]Ride Pager[VAR FF00(0000)]!
6	Why don’t you hop on there?[VAR 0114(0008)]
7	The world looks a bit different from atop a\nmighty Tauros, eh?[VAR 0114(0008)]
8	See, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nHere in Alola our Pokémon lend us their strength\nand let us ride about on them![VAR 0114(0008)]
9	Let me explain some of the gear I gave you...\c\nYour Ride Pager is a tool that lets you summon\na Ride Pokémon.\c\nAccording to the instructions, you need only \n“press the [VAR FF00(0001)]Y Button[VAR FF00(0000)] to turn on your\r\nRide Pager! Use the B Button to dash!”[VAR 0114(0008)]
10	And your Riding Wear will be the special outfit\nyou wear when riding Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0008)]
11	Have a little romp around Alola with Tauros\nhere. I’m sure you’ll be charmed by him![VAR 0114(0008)]
12	When you use your Ride Pager, Ride Pokémon\nwill kindly come running to help you wherever\r\nyou may be![VAR 0114(0008)]
110
0	Congratulations, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI hope you find your Ride Pager useful. I worked\non developing it with a friend of mine.[VAR 0114(000C)]
1	Aren’t Z-Powers lovely?[VAR 0114(000C)]
2	I’m amazed that you won without\neven using your Z-Power.[VAR 0114(000C)]
3	Let’s have a Pokémon battle when next\nwe meet![VAR 0114(000C)]
4	Very well then, off on your island challenge you\ngo! May the future bring you happiness![VAR 0114(000C)]
111
0	All right, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nWith a little help from Tauros, you can smash\nright through those big rocks on Route 1![VAR 0114(0008)]
1	[~ 1]
2	All right! I got a little something for you, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	False Swipe is a move that will leave your\nopponent with 1 HP when you attack.\c\nKeep on catching more and more Pokémon,\nyeah, and tell Rotom all about it![VAR 0114(0005)]
4	But first, you’ve gotta go let your mom know\nwhat you’re up to.\c\nWhen you’re done with that, head on down to\nthe Marina in Hau’oli City. Oh yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
5	All right, time to get the boat ready.\nLillie, you gonna help me clean it?[VAR 0114(0005)]
6	Um...\c\nI actually wanted to ask a favor of you first,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. If that’s all right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Sure!
8	What is it?
9	You see...\nNebby is...\c\nIts real home is far away from here.\nAnd I want to help it get home.[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	It’s like I told you before...\nNebby saved my life once when I was in trouble.\c\nNow I want to save it![VAR 0114(0006)]
11	I feel like there’s not much I can do on my own,\nsince I’m not a Pokémon Trainer...\c\nBut if I had a real Trainer like you helping me,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], then maybe...[VAR 0114(0006)]
12	But I probably shouldn’t ask a near stranger to\nhelp, right?\c\nI know it’s just my own wish and it has nothing\nto do with you...[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	Of course I’ll help!
14	Yeah, I don’t know...
15	Oh, thank you so much. I’m so glad!\nI really didn’t know what else to do![VAR 0114(0006)]
16	Then I suppose...\c\nThe two of us will be heading to the next island\nas well![VAR 0114(0006)]
17	Pew!
18	I...I understand.\c\nUm, but if you ever do learn anything that you\nthink might help Nebby get home...\r\nI’d really appreciate it if you could tell me.\c\nI’ll do my best to look for clues on the next\nisland on my own.\c\nAnd maybe I’ll see you there.[VAR 0114(0006)]
19	Pew!
20	[~ 20]
21	[~ 21]
22	[~ 22]
112
0	Hey, Prof, are you sure this old thing’s\nreally seaworthy?[VAR 0114(0007)]
1	Hey now! Don’t you go calling my boat old!\nShe’s not old...\c\nCall her a classic. Well seasoned, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
2	I quite like that it has a sense of history...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Pew!
4	Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nIf you’re all done with catching Pokémon and\nshopping, yeah, you wanna head out with us?[VAR 0114(0005)]
5	Oh yeah!\nTime to sail away. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
6	No sweat, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nFinish up whatever you want to do on Melemele.\c\nThough you can always come back anytime![VAR 0114(0005)]
7	I heard that every island has different-flavored\nmalasada! Man, I can’t wait to try ’em all![VAR 0114(0007)]
8	The next island...\nIt’s too far away to see with the naked eye.[VAR 0114(0006)]
113
0	We-e-e are off!
1	Come on, grandma!\nKick it up a notch!
2	If we push the boat much harder than this,\nwe may all end up at the bottom of the ocean.
3	Ha ha ha! You’re probably just worried about\nyour silly hat flying off!
4	I wonder what kind of island Akala is, huh?
5	Seeing all of Alola for myself is half the fun of\ndoing the island challenge!
6	Isn’t this just the best, [VAR 0100(0000)]?!
114
0	Land ahoy!\c\nAll right!\nAkala Island, here I come![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	Isn’t it a bit late to declare “land ahoy” after\nyou’ve already arrived onshore?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	What a stick in the sand! Help me out here,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! It was funny, right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
3	It was pretty funny
4	It was supposed to be funny?
5	What about you, Professor?[VAR 0114(0007)]
6	The land is certainly ahoy, oh boy![VAR 0114(0005)]
7	Still haven’t managed to find a shirt that goes\nwith your lab coat, hmm, Kukui?[VAR 0114(0030)]
8	I’ve told you you’re gonna scare off strangers\nlooking like that...[VAR 0114(0030)]
9	...Nebby. Back into the bag.[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Don’t sweat it, Lillie.[VAR 0114(0005)]
115
0	Why hello there. Nice to meet you all—I’m Olivia.[VAR 0114(0009)]
1	Hey! Thanks for stopping by!\c\nI’m Mallow, one of the captains here![VAR 0114(000E)]
2	I was on my way to see who was pulling into\nport and ran into Mallow here while she was\r\nout on a delivery.[VAR 0114(0009)]
3	Yup! My trial will be a chance for all the fine\ningredients that make up your team to shine![VAR 0114(000E)]
4	Especially you two!\nYour Pokémon look ready to cook with gas![VAR 0114(000E)]
5	And Mallow isn’t the only captain here on \nAkala Island, of course.[VAR 0114(0009)]
6	So? What’s the plan, kids?[VAR 0114(0009)]
7	Yeah, that’s up to these kids.\nIt’s their island challenge, after all![VAR 0114(0005)]
8	Yes...I suppose so.[VAR 0114(0009)]
9	OK, then.\c\nEnjoy your time on your island challenge, kids,\nalong with your Pokémon.\c\nI’ll be waiting for my chance to face you\nin battle when the time comes.[VAR 0114(0009)]
10	I’m looking forward to seeing what you’ve got![VAR 0114(0009)]
11	Let’s go, Mallow.[VAR 0114(0009)]
12	I’m sure she wanted to come see that you made\nit here all right...\c\nBut she’ll never admit it to you! Hah!\c\nThat’s Olivia for you.\nShe’s a kind [VAR FF00(0001)]kahuna[VAR FF00(0000)], deep down.[VAR 0114(0005)]
13	There are [VAR FF00(0001)]three trials[VAR FF00(0000)] here on Akala Island.\c\nIf you two decide you want to take on the trial\nstraightaway, head up Route 4 there and keep\r\non goin’ until you get to Paniola Town.[VAR 0114(0005)]
14	Shoots, I know where I’m going first,\nand that is straight to the Pokémon Center![VAR 0114(0007)]
15	I wonder what kind of malasada they make\non Akala, eh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
16	Maybe I’ll see about some shopping of my own...\c\nAnd I should find out about the ruins for\nNebby’s sake, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
17	You’ve made it to Akala, [VAR 1100(00FF,0B07)]big boyclever girl!\nThis means a whole new [VAR FF00(0001)]Island Pokédex[VAR FF00(0000)], zzt!\c\nI’ll try to keep you up to date on all the new\nPokémon you uncover, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Zzzzzt![VAR 0114(0035)]

0	Oh! [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Pew?
2	You looking for the ruins?
3	You looking for new clothes?
4	Yes, this little fellow will hardly sit still...\c\nI think Nebby might be interested in visiting\nthe Ruins of Life.\c\nApparently they house the sacred guardian of\nAkala Island. A creature called Tapu Lele.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	Well, yes, I was doing that, too.\nBut this little fellow will hardly sit still...\c\nI think Nebby might be interested in visiting\nthe Ruins of Life.\c\nApparently they house the sacred guardian of\nAkala Island. A creature called Tapu Lele.[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Pew?
7	I wondered if you’d like to come with us when\nwe go to visit the ruins...\c\nI mean...little Nebby here seems to like you quite\na bit, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	I’ll be at Tide Song Hotel if you decide you want\nto come.\c\nI’m supposed to be meeting someone there...\nSomeone very important to me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	I’ll be all right.\nI can see the building from here, after all.\r\nEven I shouldn’t be able to lose my way. I think.[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Pew!
11	And you! I’ll have you stay in your bag, mister.[VAR 0114(0006)]
12	I’ve heard that there is a group of terrible\npeople around who try to steal Pokémon.\r\nA group called Team Skull.\c\nWe need to be careful if we want to escape the\nnotice of such a collection of villains...\c\nIsn’t that right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	I wonder if the guardian of Akala will also be\ninterested in you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\r\nYou are the one who got that sparkling stone.[VAR 0114(0006)]
117
0	Stop right there![VAR 0114(0030)]
1	Ah ha ha! We didn’t mean to surprise you.\nYou must be doing your island challenge.[VAR 0114(0030)]
2	I’m Dexio.[VAR 0114(0027)]
3	My name’s Sina!\nA beautiful name for a beautiful lady![VAR 0114(0026)]
4	We’re here seeing the sights in Alola.\c\nIts unique tradition of island challenge...\nIt’s pretty fascinating, I’ve got to say.[VAR 0114(0027)]
5	Oh, I’ve got an idea!\nYou and Dexio should battle![VAR 0114(0026)]
6	And why should we do that?\c\nThough I might as well test my skills.\c\nIs that all right with you?[VAR 0114(0027)]
7	Then I’ll let my partners go wild![VAR 0114(0027)]
8	If you’d ever like to battle, I’d be willing.\nJust ask.[VAR 0114(0027)]
9	Oh, I’ve got an idea!\nWhy don’t you test your skills with me?[VAR 0114(0026)]
10	OK! Let’s get this show on the road![VAR 0114(0026)]
11	OK, I’ll wait till you’re up to the challenge of my\nawesome team![VAR 0114(0026)]
12	That’s what I would expect from a Trainer\ndoing the island challenge.\c\nI felt the bond between you and your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0027)]
13	I get it... Facing trials helps you grow close to\nyour team.\c\nI think that’s absolutely wonderful![VAR 0114(0026)]
14	I feel like I’ve been able to have a glimpse of\nthe island challenge!\c\nLet me heal your Pokémon as thanks![VAR 0114(0026)]
15	You and your Pokémon are the ultimate team!\nNo doubt about it!\c\nThis battle reminded me of us in the past...and\nthat group of five young Trainers.\c\nI’ve made up my mind! I’ll entrust this important\nitem to you![VAR 0114(0027)]
16	The item that I just gave you is for collecting\nthe Cores and Cells of a Pokémon—Zygarde.\c\nI’ll tell you the details another time, so please\nkeep it safe for now.\c\nFor your island challenge, it might not be a bad\nidea to go to Route 4 to train your Pokémon.\c\nWe’ll be taking our leave now!\nBon voyage![VAR 0114(0026)]
118
0	Hey! [VAR 0100(0000)]! Glad I ran into you...\c\nSo we can see who’s stronger now!\c\nMy gramps must’ve thought I did good enough in\nmy grand trial, ’cause he gave me a Z-Ring, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	Having a battle in a place like Paniola Town\nfeels like we’re in a real old-fashioned Western\r\nshowdown or something, right?\r\nThis is so cool!\c\nThough if we’re real honorable cowboys, we’ve\ngotta make sure our teams are healthy first.[VAR 0114(0007)]
2	Awright, Pikachu and team!\nLet’s show this newbie what Alola’s got![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Ma-a-an, that was some kinda battle!\c\nOur Pokémon all look like they had a blast, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	Right then. Here. I’ll share my bit of good luck\nwith you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0007)]
5	You know how the Totem Pokémon are all, like,\nsurrounded by some aura of power?\c\nIf you use a Dire Hit on your Pokémon and\nmanage to land a critical hit, that aura won’t\r\nmean a thing![VAR 0114(0007)]
6	You know, Pokémon battles are just, like,\nsometimes you win, sometimes you lose.\c\nBut you’re only really a loser if you don’t have\nany fun while you’re at it. Right?\c\nAnyway, I’m heading off to Paniola Ranch![VAR 0114(0007)]
119
0	Oh! You’ve got to be a trial-goer, right?\nWell, you’ve got a good sense of timing!

2	Thanks for stopping by![VAR 0114(000E)]
3	The Moomoo Milk from Paniola Ranch is the\nbest. It’s so rich and creamy when you use\r\nit in white sauce and other things...\r\nMmm! The taste can’t even be described![VAR 0114(000E)]
4	Oh, by the way! Since I was lucky enough to run\ninto you here, I’ll do you a little favor.[VAR 0114(000E)]
5	Stoutland was registered to your Ride Pager!
6	See, Stoutland can sniff out items for you that\nare buried in the dirt where you can’t even\r\nsee them!\c\nWhen you’re riding Stoutland, pressing the\nB Button to use that Stoutland [VAR FF00(0001)]Search[VAR FF00(0000)] is what\r\nit’s all about!\c\nGet up there and try it! There’s all kinds of\nstuff laying around waiting for you to find it![VAR 0114(000E)]
7	If you go all the way down Route 5, you’ll come\nout on Brooklet Hill. My friend Lana is up there,\r\nso say hi to her for me if you see her![VAR 0114(000E)]

1	Are you even taking this seriously?[VAR 0114(0030)]
2	I am! So seriously!\nI’m seriously enjoying it![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	...Enjoying it?[VAR 0114(0030)]
4	You can enjoy Pokémon battling when you put\neverything you have into it...\r\nwhich clearly you haven’t.[VAR 0114(0030)]
5	Whoa!\nHey, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
6	This guy is plenny scary![VAR 0114(0007)]
7	You’re [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0030)]
8	Yeah, that’s me
9	Nope, not me
10	Who?
11	Hmph. Not very cautious.\c\nEven some Pokémon have a better sense of\nself-preservation than you apparently do.[VAR 0114(0030)]
12	Hmm. So you have enough sense to be wary.\nNot bad...[VAR 0114(0030)]
13	I’m Gladion.\c\nI battle for my partner, Null, to make it strong.\c\nThough most of our time gets used up doing\nsmall jobs for Team Skull.[VAR 0114(0013)]
14	Battle me.\nI won’t take no for an answer.[VAR 0114(0013)]
15	Hmph... \nIt’s not like me to slip up like that.[VAR 0114(0013)]
16	I’ve got to keep fighting stronger opponents.\nLooks like I’m still not ready...[VAR 0114(0013)]
17	What?
18	Strong opponents?
19	That kid there.\nHis Pokémon aren’t weak.[VAR 0114(0013)]
20	And sure, it’s fine to enjoy battling...[VAR 0114(0013)]
21	But this brat...\c\nhe’s just using that as an excuse not to try\nhard because he can’t beat the kahuna.\r\nBecause he can’t beat Hala when he’s serious![VAR 0114(0013)]
22	You know my gramps?\nWait. So you think I’m strong?[VAR 0114(0007)]
23	Awww, look at you, little Gladion!\nAren’t you just a real cool guy? Heh heh heh...[VAR 0114(0031)]
24	I guess it’s no surprise a homeless kid would\nturn out spineless, too, huh?\c\nNo worries! We’ve got enough backbone to\ncover for you![VAR 0114(0032)]
25	Just give it up already.[VAR 0114(0013)]
26	Huh?[VAR 0114(0031)]
27	You know you can’t beat me.\nYou’ll just get your Pokémon hurt for no reason.[VAR 0114(0013)]
28	They’re good Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0013)]
29	We came all this way, and for what?\nFor a big fat waste of our time, thanks to you.\c\nIf you hadn’t gotten in our way, we could’ve\nstolen the Totem Pokémon from Brooklet Hill![VAR 0114(0032)]
30	Let’s get out of here. Look, the Murkrow are\ncrying, and it’s time we should be flying.[VAR 0114(0032)]
31	Listen up good, Gladion...\nThe boss does like you. That’s true.\c\nBut you’re just some hired help we keep around\nfor when we need you.\c\nYou aren’t part of Team Skull, not really.\nAnd you never will be. Got it? You better get it.[VAR 0114(0031)]
32	Thanks, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nAnd [VAR 0101(0001)], too.\r\nIt was a good battle![VAR 0114(0007)]
33	Phew... Looks like I’ve gotta train up my team if\nI’m gonna take on the trial at Brooklet Hill next!\c\nHere, [VAR 0100(0000)], take these with you.\nWe’re gonna beat this island challenge![VAR 0114(0007)]
34	Doing squats really uses all your muscles!\nMy legs are shaking so hard, I can’t move!
35	I’m not doing Alolan sumo! I’m not!\nI’m definitely not trying to be like Kahuna Hala!

1	Look at that vigorous splashing!\c\nI wouldn’t be surprised to find a fearsome\nPokémon is the one causing it all...[VAR 0114(000D)]
2	So, brave trial-goer, I would like to ask you to\ninvestigate that splashing there and find out\r\nwhat exactly is causing it.\c\nI won’t ask you to swim out there, of course.\nI have a lovely gift for you instead.[VAR 0114(000D)]
3	Lapras was registered to your Ride Pager!

1	Did you see that splashing?\nI wonder what it is...\c\nI’d go and check it out for myself, but clinging\nto a clammy Lapras over the waves... Urp!\r\nIt makes me seasick just thinking about it!
2	Oh my...\c\nSo it was Wishiwashi kicking up all that water?\c\nEven a little Wishiwashi can make such\nbig waves...[VAR 0114(000D)]
3	*splash splash* 
4	Oh me. What is that?\c\nI can hear wild splashing from over there...\nIt sounds even larger than what we just saw.[VAR 0114(000D)]
5	Is it a Pokémon?\nIs it a person?\c\nI suppose we had better go check.[VAR 0114(000D)]

1	Ah...\nI’m sorry. What was your name?\c\n... ... ...\c\nOf course! [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nIt is a lovely name. Just lovely.[VAR 0114(000D)]
2	Now look over there.\nDo you see that?[VAR 0114(000D)]
3	Whatever is kicking up such lovely splashes\nmust be rather big...\c\nA strapping young Swimmer, perhaps?\nOr an amazing Pokémon specimen?[VAR 0114(000D)]
4	Are you going somewhere?\c\nI would still like you to investigate those\nsplashes in the water.[VAR 0114(000D)]
5	[~ 5]
126
0	Oh my.\c\nSo it was another Wishiwashi that was kicking\nup all that water?\c\nHmm. How unfortunate.\nIt wasn’t a strapping young Swimmer after all...[VAR 0114(000D)]
1	*splash splash splash splash*
2	Oh my word!\c\nNow what is that? Even more furious splashing?\nIt sounds as big as a Wailord.[VAR 0114(000D)]
3	It might just be another Pokémon, but...\c\nMaybe, just maybe, we’ll be lucky enough to\nfind a spry young Swimmer floundering in the\r\nwater and in need of saving![VAR 0114(000D)]
4	Let’s go investigate it, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]
5	It began to rain!

2	Really?
3	It was only a joke, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nYou’re rather trusting, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(000D)]
4	Oh dear...\nYou won’t be tricked easily, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000D)]
5	But we are near the sea.\c\nIf that splashing sound is coming from the sea...\nthen I wonder what is causing it.\c\nAnd now it is raining, as well.\nThe rain will boost the power of any Water-type\r\nmoves by half again...\c\nCould those splashes be caused by some\nPokémon whose moves are now growing ever\r\nstronger in the falling rain?[VAR 0114(000D)]
128

1	You’ve come all this way with me...[VAR 0114(000D)]
2	That’s right. Didn’t you notice? You passed \nthrough the Captain’s gate by my side.\r\nWhich means that you will undergo my trial![VAR 0114(000D)]
3	To clear my trial, you must defeat the great\nTotem Pokémon known as the lord of the ocean![VAR 0114(000D)]
4	That spray of water you can see there!\nThat is where you will probably find the totem.\c\nAnd perhaps those Wishiwashi you battled\nagainst will also want their revenge...\c\nDefeat whatever comes at you and prove your\nstrength to me![VAR 0114(000D)]
5	And remember that you cannot catch any\nPokémon here unless you complete my trial.\c\nSo let the trial begin![VAR 0114(000D)]

1	I...I must say that I find myself at an\nimpasse here.\c\nAll of the Wishiwashi that I so diligently trained\nup were defeated, and that is very frustrating...\c\nbut of course I cannot let your completion of my\ntrial go uncelebrated, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000D)]
2	You were amazing, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nTruly impressive.\c\nPlease take this.[VAR 0114(000D)]
3	You do know what this is, don’t you?\c\nWatch. This is how you use Waterium Z.[VAR 0114(000D)]
4	And that’s not all I can offer you.\c\nHere. This is a Lana original.\nOne of my own handmade fishing rods.[VAR 0114(000D)]
5	This is how you use my fishing rod:\c\nWhen you want to fish for Pokémon, look for\npiles of rocks in the water.\r\nFish like to hide in the shadows there.\c\nWhen you see your bob dip under the water,\nyou have a bite. But you won’t for long.\c\nThe Pokémon will struggle to get away, so\npress  as soon as you see the “!” mark.[VAR 0114(000D)]

7	By the way...\c\nDid you know I once reeled in a red Gyarados?[VAR 0114(000D)]
8	You did?!
9	Did you really?
10	Well, what do you think?[VAR 0114(000D)]
11	You did a fine job today.\c\nShall I see you back to the Pokémon Center on\nRoute 5?[VAR 0114(000D)]
12	Good. Let’s be going then.\nAnd you can always do a spot of fishing later.[VAR 0114(000D)]

1	Oh. And that reminds me...\nDid you see any Sudowoodo by Paniola Ranch?\c\nThey were causing some trouble for people, so I\ngave them a little dose of Z-Power using my\r\nWaterium Z. Just a little lesson for them.\c\nI wonder how they will react now that they see\nthat you have Waterium Z, too?\c\nHeh.[VAR 0114(000D)]

16	Floooon?
17	Ne-hiiiiii!
18	Mudsdale, shall we stomp these scoundrels?\c\nIt’ll be a mess to clean up afterward, but\nI am willing if you are.[VAR 0114(000B)]
19	Time for us to break out, yo!\nGotta tell y’all peace out, yo![VAR 0114(0032)]
20	I’m not gonna keep telling you this...\nexcept when I keep telling you this!\c\nYou better listen to what my homie says\nand drill it into that thick skull of yours!\r\nSeriously! You’d better not forget, numskull![VAR 0114(0031)]

2	This is how you use the Fire-type Z-Power![VAR 0114(000F)]
3	Thank you, my dear Marowak![VAR 0114(000F)]
4	For when you meet a Pokémon that you would\nlike to make your companion, take these![VAR 0114(000F)]
5	What’s more!\c\nYou may now use the Ride Pokémon Charizard.\c\nCharizard will lend you his strength, and you\nwill be able to go anywhere you have been in\r\nan instant.[VAR 0114(000F)]
6	Charizard was registered to your Ride Pager!
7	The Firium Z...you should show it to the\nTrial Guide outside the captain’s barricade at\r\nthe bottom of the mountain.\c\nIt is time for us to return to our dance.\nThe feelings of the Alolan people and our\r\nPokémon, and the true nature of Z-Power...\c\nThe answers lie in our dance! And so we must\ndance on![VAR 0114(000F)]

0	You there![VAR 0114(0030)]
1	Oh, excuse me! I am a scientist.\nMy name is Colress.\c\nThe theme of my research is:\n“Bringing out the potential of Pokémon.”\c\nWhat brings out the power of Pokémon is...[VAR 0114(002B)]
2	I believe that is—the bond they share with\ntheir Trainers![VAR 0114(002B)]
3	And thus my attention is drawn to Trainers\nlike yourself...\c\nTrainers bound to their Pokémon through the\npower of the Z-Ring![VAR 0114(002B)]
4	Now that I think of it, I never asked your name.\c\n...[VAR 0114(002B)]
5	[~ 5]
6	[~ 6]
7	[~ 7]
8	Z-Power...\c\nIs it the true potential that I seek?\nDoes it surpass the Mega Ring?\c\nApparently, there are uninhabited islands for\nPokémon called [VAR FF00(0001)]Poké Pelago[VAR FF00(0000)] here in Alola.\c\nAlola is fascinating! I believe that I will stay in\nAlola for some time![VAR 0114(002B)]
9	Well then, [VAR 0100(0000)], I hope to see you\nagain sometime.[VAR 0114(002B)]
10	[VAR 0100(0000)], is it?\nI’ll remember your name.\c\nTo commemorate our encounter, let me give\nyou a TM.[VAR 0114(002B)]
11	If you’re able to utilize Flame Charge fully,\nyou’ll be able to have a great battle with the\r\ntotem in the next trial...the trial in Lush Jungle.[VAR 0114(002B)]
155
0	Woo! What’s that sweet smell I smell, driftin’\nmy way?! Could it be a tasty Mallow Special?[VAR 0114(0005)]
1	I heard you cleared Mallow’s trial, yeah?\nAll right then, I have a present for you!\c\nThat little TM right there is Smart Strike—a move\nthat will never miss![VAR 0114(0005)]
2	There’ll be all kinds of discoveries and new\nexperiences to make your adventure brighter![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	There’s a facility, yeah, that I want you to\ngo check out on your island challenge.\c\nThe Dimensional Research Lab!\nLet’s get on over there with Extreme Speed![VAR 0114(0005)]
156
0	Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Guess I should\ncongratulate you on clearing all three of Akala\r\nIsland’s trials... Congrats!\c\nLooks like it’s time for you to take on Kahuna\nOlivia’s grand trial![VAR 0114(0005)]
1	Olivia is an expert user of Rock-type Pokémon.\nYou’re gonna wanna catch some Grass-type\r\nPokémon in Lush Jungle to add to your team.[VAR 0114(0005)]
2	Whenever you’re ready for the grand trial, come\nsee me at the Dimensional Research Lab!\c\nIt’s down past Route 6, yeah, but just ask\nRotom if you need some help![VAR 0114(0005)]
157
0	Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Howzit!\nI knew I heard your footsteps![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	I just finished up Mallow’s trial, you know?\c\nPhew! That Mallow Special of hers was just\nabout good enough to break the mouth, eh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
2	You heading to the Dimensional Research Lab?\nYou just keep on going straightaways that way.\r\nMaybe I’ll catch you there later![VAR 0114(0007)]
158
0	[~ 0]
1	Go, Nebby!\nUse...use Splash![VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Pew?
3	Heh...\nI was just acting like I was [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	You...you always seemed to end up getting hurt,\nNebby.\c\nSo I never really liked Pokémon Trainers or\nthought that I would want to be one myself.\c\nBut when I see [VAR 0100(0000)] and Hau...\c\nIt’s like they’ve thrown open some door that I\nalways thought was closed...\r\nThey stride straight through it into the future...\r\nIt seems...so amazing somehow...[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	Pew?
6	Oh![VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Um, oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Hello.\nI feel like it’s been a while since we last met.\c\nTh-there’s a laboratory here that studies the\ndimensions, did you know?\c\nAnd the professor is waiting to meet you![VAR 0114(0006)]
8	How...how were your trials?\nIt must be quite trying to do three in a row.[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	It was no problem
10	It was really tough
11	Goodness, really? It wasn’t any trouble for you\nto tackle all three of Akala Island’s trials?\c\nI suppose that explains it.\c\nThe reason you look so content and understood\nby [VAR 0101(0001)] there, I mean.[VAR 0114(0006)]
12	I would think so...\nBut still! You made it through all three!\c\nI think that explains it.\c\nThe reason you look so content and understood\nby [VAR 0101(0001)] there, I mean.[VAR 0114(0006)]
159
0	Hey there, honey![VAR 0114(0005)]
1	Oh, hi![VAR 0114(0030)]
2	This here’s Professor Burnet.\c\nShe runs the Dimensional Research Lab, yeah...\c\nAnd she’s also my wife![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	You’re [VAR 0100(0000)], right?\nLillie told me about you.\c\nShe said you were the reliable sort.[VAR 0114(001B)]
4	Three months ago...\c\nI found Lillie lying on a beach.\c\nCosmog in her bag also unconscious.[VAR 0114(001B)]
5	Hm?\nNo Hau today?[VAR 0114(001B)]
6	Hau? He’s out doing his own thing.\c\nBut he’ll be the real deal someday... He could\neven become a kahuna, just like old Hala\r\nbefore him![VAR 0114(0005)]
7	You really think so?![VAR 0114(0007)]
8	Whoa-ho!\c\nWell, yeah, I really do.[VAR 0114(0005)]
9	Good to see you again, Hau!\nIt’s been a while since I last saw you.[VAR 0114(001B)]
10	Anyhow, I brought [VAR 0100(0000)] here\nbecause I wanted you to tell h[VAR 1100(0000,0202)]imer about some of\r\nthe mysterious phenomena here in Alola.[VAR 0114(0005)]
11	I’d be happy to!\c\nThe mysteries of Alola, huh?\nThen you’ve got to mean...[VAR 0114(001B)]
12	the [VAR FF00(0001)]Ultra Wormhole[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(001B)]
13	It’s extremely rare, but sometimes a hole opens\nin the sky over Alola.\c\nIt appears that this rift leads to a different\nand unknown dimension.[VAR 0114(001B)]
14	The reason that people think there may be a\nmysterious dimension is because of the legends\r\nof fearsome Pokémon appearing from the Ultra\r\nWormhole.[VAR 0114(001B)]
15	Pew...
16	It’s very weak as proof, but I can’t ignore it.\c\nThere is also plenty of evidence already in the\nPokédex for the existence of different\r\ndimensions, right?[VAR 0114(001B)]
17	Fearsome Pokémon...?[VAR 0114(0007)]
18	Even normal wild Pokémon sometimes attack\npeople, right?\c\nBut the Pokémon that appeared from the Ultra\nWormhole went way beyond that.[VAR 0114(001B)]
19	They were called Ultra Beasts...\nAnd they were feared.\c\nIf the stories are to be believed, the guardian\ndeities of the islands fought desperately\r\nagainst them.[VAR 0114(001B)]
20	But like I said, it’s all legends and folktales.\nIt’s hard to know how much is true.[VAR 0114(001B)]
21	But I would be very happy if I could somehow\nunravel the mysteries of the Ultra Wormhole by\r\nstudying the dimensional disturbances![VAR 0114(001B)]
22	We’ve recorded several known relationships\nbetween Pokémon and different dimensions\r\nin books. You can find them on the bookshelf\r\nin this lab.[VAR 0114(001B)]
160
0	You want to know what happened three\nmonths ago?\c\nWell, I’d wanted to learn more about Nebby...\c\nI mean, about Cosmog.\c\nSo I decided to come speak to Professor Burnet.\c\nBut I got lost along the way...and ended up\nwandering about until I collapsed on the shore...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	She listened to my story, staying up all night to\nhear it all. And then she even got her husband,\r\nProfessor Kukui, to lend me his loft to stay in...\c\nAnd she told him to help me investigate\nNebby’s origins, too.\c\nProfessor Burnet has been so kind, and she’s\nstill helping me try to find a way to get Nebby\r\nback to its own home...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	She’s been like...like a real mother to me.[VAR 0114(0006)]
161
0	Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Go see what you\ncan learn from everybody![VAR 0114(0005)]
1	How about that, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nIf Ultra Beasts are really out there, I wonder\nwhat kinds of moves they can use...[VAR 0114(0005)]
2	You’ve finished all three of Akala’s trials. Woo!\nAnd now comes the big match against Olivia—\r\nthe island kahuna!\c\nIt’s the biggest and baddest trial of them all\nhere on Akala—the grand trial![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	Good luck!\c\nOlivia’s house is past Diglett’s Tunnel.\nIt’s in Konikoni City!\c\nBut watch out for Team Skull![VAR 0114(001B)]
4	I still have some things I want to talk to\nProfessor Burnet about, so I’ll stay here.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	I’m off to check out Diglett’s Tunnel next!\nIt’s a whole cave made by Pokémon, right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
162
0	What was that just now?\nIt looked like...a crack in the sky?!
1	What was that just now?\nIt looked like...a crack in the sky?!
163
0	Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nSo you’ve made it through all three captains’\ntrials, yeah?\c\nThen you should go meet Kahuna Olivia!\nShe lives in the town past Diglett’s Tunnel.[VAR 0114(0007)]
1	Diglett’s Tunnel is...let’s see...\nFrom here, it’s kinda near the PMC!\c\nIt’s easy to walk right past it, though, so keep\nyour eyes peeled![VAR 0114(0007)]
2	Now it’s malasada time for me![VAR 0114(0007)]
164
0	Hmm? Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)], wasn’t it?[VAR 0114(0009)]
1	This cave really is something, y’know?\c\nIt’s overflowing with these Pokémon called \nDiglett, and they are getting really out of hand.\r\nMediocre Trainers can’t even get through![VAR 0114(0009)]
2	So, how’s your island challenge going?\nLet me see which crystals you’ve earned.[VAR 0114(0009)]
3	Couldn’t wait to come see me, hmm?\c\nBut tackle Brooklet Hill first.\nIt’s right past Paniola Town.[VAR 0114(0009)]
4	OK, you’re doing all right! How’s that Waterium Z\nworking out for you?\c\nJudging by how well you and your team get\nalong, I bet you guys can do some real damage\r\nwith it!\c\nOK, [VAR 0100(0000)], Kiawe’s trial is next!\nOff to Wela Volcano Park you go![VAR 0114(0009)]
5	It looks like you’ve tackled everything but\nAkala Island’s last trial in Lush Jungle!\c\nJust relax and have fun with it. Your Pokémon\nwill be happier that way, too.[VAR 0114(0009)]
6	Oh hey, since you’re here on Akala...\c\nHave you made it out to our Dimensional\nResearch Lab yet?\c\nTraveling about for your island challenge is\nabout more than just trials, you know.\r\nHave a look around while you’re at it.[VAR 0114(0009)]
7	Ooh, look at you, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Nice work!\nI see you’ve even passed Mallow’s trial.\c\nIt’s about time you had some fun with me!\nThe Diglett have settled down, too.\c\nIf you are as strong as you appear, you should\nbe able to make it through this cave.[VAR 0114(0009)]
8	At the other end of it, you’ll find Konikoni City.\c\nThat’s where my shop is. I’ll see you there![VAR 0114(0009)]
165
0	Phew...\c\nWith Olivia in charge, we’ve finally managed to\nmake some headway against those Diglett.
1	Oh! Alola!\c\nWe’re members of the Aether Foundation.\nWe work to support Pokémon conservation.
2	It seems like Team Skull was responsible for\nthe Diglett in this cave getting so riled up and\r\nbringing them all up to the surface.
3	Oh, Team Skull is this group of troublemakers,\nyou see...\c\nThey seem to delight in interfering with Trainers\nand their Pokémon.
4	Diglett normally live in elaborate systems of\nunderground tunnels that take years to dig out.\c\nWe’re here to ensure that they return to their\ntunnels and let people pass through here\r\nwithout having to fight so many Pokémon.
5	Some of the Diglett are still stuck on or near the\nsurface, though, so be careful!
166
0	Ahh, no way...\c\nJust when things were startin’ to heat up, yo,\nI got surrounded by Diglett and beat up, yo!\c\nYo, since when can Diglett use Beat Up?![VAR 0114(0031)]
1	I’m so mad that now I want to beat up on\nsome fools.\c\nDon’t be mad ’cause you were the fool who was\ndumb enough to be here right now.[VAR 0114(0031)]
2	[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Aue! I was wondering who you were playing\naround with without me, and it’s Team Skull![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	You want some? That’s how we say hello!\nNice knowing you, punks![VAR 0114(0031)]
5	Yo, step off! Enough with the beating up, yo![VAR 0114(0032)]
6	We may not be trying to take over the world or\nnothing, but we’re still hard as bone out here![VAR 0114(0031)]
7	See you on the flip side![VAR 0114(0007)]
8	Man, [VAR 0100(0000)], when I fight with you...\nIt’s like even my Pokémon feel more at ease!\c\nYou really are some kind of Trainer.\c\nThat’s it! I’ve just gotta give you something![VAR 0114(0007)]
9	Max Ethers will restore all the PP to one of your\nmoves, you know? Pretty great, right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
10	Now I’m gonna go have some more fun with\nthose Diglett! See ya![VAR 0114(0007)]
167
0	Nopass!
1	The Pokémon is holding a letter...\c\nYou take the letter and read it.
2	[VAR 0100(0000)]-Olivia here. This is Probopass.\nIt watches the shop whenever I’m away.\nI know I asked you to meet me here, but there’s\nbeen a change of plans. Come meet me at the\nRuins of Life past Memorial Hill, when you can.
3	Pass?
4	Medicine?
5	That’s for me?
6	Pass-pass!
7	Will you read the letter that Probopass holds? 
8	Pass-pass!
168
0	Team Skull!\nGive back that Pokémon!
1	Don’t give me trouble!\nI’ll reduce you to rubble![VAR 0114(0031)]
2	That’s right! We’re gonna sell this Pokémon to\nget rich, and we won’t make no bones about it!\c\nIf you want it back, you’re gonna have to take it![VAR 0114(0032)]
3	Stand firm!\nThink of what the president would say![VAR 0114(0030)]
4	That’s what you say, Chief!\nBut you don’t lift a finger!
5	Why, I am the Aether Foundation’s last\nline of defense!\c\nWhat would become of the foundation if\nsomething were to happen to me now?[VAR 0114(0030)]
6	Ah! Here is a promising young Trainer!\c\nFight in my stead, child, and rout these Team\nSkull ruffians.\r\nI will bestow honor upon you, if you do![VAR 0114(0030)]
7	You ready?\nCuz I was born ready, yo![VAR 0114(0031)]
8	That loss was pathetic!\nYour moves were so kinetic![VAR 0114(0031)]
9	We don’t need this Pokémon anyway!\nTake it then! Good luck and good riddance![VAR 0114(0032)]
10	Phew...
11	Lo-o-ow?
12	Thanks, kid!
13	Yes, indeed. You are a trial-goer, aren’t you?\nYou’re a splendid Trainer.[VAR 0114(0030)]
14	I am deeply impressed!\c\nI’d like to reward you by showing you something\ntruly astounding.\c\nOnce you have finished your grand trial, come to\nHano Grand Resort and I will take you to see\r\na wondrous place.[VAR 0114(0030)]
15	Thank you for helping us out.\nI really owe you!
16	I’m so glad there are nice young Trainers like you\naround. Good luck on your island challenge!
169
0	So, you’re the one Gladion was talking about?\c\n...Hmph.\nYou don’t look like anything special to me.[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	I’m Plumeria.[VAR 0114(0018)]
2	I help keep Team Skull together.\nI’m like a big sister to all these numskulls.\c\nYou have realized what idiots all these guys\nare, right?[VAR 0114(0018)]
3	But don’t you think some dummies are cute\nin their dumbness?\c\nYou know what I mean, right? You picking on\nmy cute, dumb brothers and sisters is really\r\nannoying me![VAR 0114(0018)]
4	Hmmph!\nYou’re pretty strong. I’ll give you that.\c\nBut mess with anyone in Team Skull again, and\nI’ll show you how serious I can get.[VAR 0114(0018)]
170
0	[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(001B)]
1	Lillie got lost again, so I brought her\nhere to you.\c\nShe couldn’t even find her way to the Tide\nSong Hotel on her own!\c\nShe said she saw Team Skull and tried to avoid\nthem. That’s why she got lost.[VAR 0114(001B)]
2	Now I’ve gotta go. The Masked Royal has a\nmatch, and there’s no way that I’m missing it![VAR 0114(001B)]
3	That Masked Royal...\c\nWhat do you think he looks like under that\nmask, anyway?[VAR 0114(001B)]
171
0	I came here for Nebby.\c\nThough...\c\nas you saw, I didn’t come here myself so much\nas I was brought here with the\r\nprofessor’s help...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Oh! Look at poor [VAR 0101(0001)].\nLet me heal it for you, won’t you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Within these ruins waits the guardian deity of\nAkala Island...\r\nThis is Tapu Lele’s ruin.[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Pew!
4	You! I know you tried to drag me along to the\nRuins of Conflict on Melemele Island, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	Why are these ruins important to you?\nWhat do the guardians mean to you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Just think what would have happened to you if\n[VAR 0100(0000)] hadn’t been there back then...[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Pew!!!
8	Oh, haven’t I seen you with Kukui?[VAR 0114(0009)]
9	Oh! Yes, my name is Lillie.\nI work as Professor Kukui’s assistant.\c\nAnd this is [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Oh! Sorry, I never even asked your name before,\ndid I?\c\nTapu Lele summoned me here to clean up\nthe ruins.[VAR 0114(0009)]
11	[VAR 0100(0000)]...thanks for getting\nto know the people and Pokémon of Alola.[VAR 0114(0009)]
172
0	All right, then!\c\nYou’ve completed the trials of all three captains\nhere on Akala Island.\c\nNow you face the grand trial of the kahuna—me![VAR 0114(0009)]
1	Get ready for your hardest Pokémon battle yet\non Akala![VAR 0114(0009)]
2	I’d love to!
3	Not yet
4	Great! We’re gonna give you guys everything\nwe’ve got!\c\nAnd my partners are all adorable, rugged little\nRock types![VAR 0114(0009)]
5	Fine! I don’t want to win just because you\nweren’t prepared well enough.[VAR 0114(0009)]
6	If it’s all right with you, [VAR 0100(0000)], I think\nNebby and I would like to watch, too.[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Diamonds only sparkle after coal is pushed\nto its absolute limit.[VAR 0114(0009)]
8	You guys are the best!\c\nHere. The Rock-type Z-Crystal...\nThe Rockium Z is all yours![VAR 0114(0009)]
9	The Rock-type Z-Power...you have to move like\nthis to draw it out!\c\nWatch carefully, because the hip movement\nis crucial![VAR 0114(0009)]
10	Use it well.\c\nThe Rock type...\c\nIt’s hard. Sturdy. Rugged and physically strong.\c\nSo nothing like me at all! I guess opposites really\ndo attract.[VAR 0114(0009)]
11	Pew?
173
0	Pew!
1	You look very pleased, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	By the way, Lillie, this might be a weird\nquestion, but...\c\nWhy even come to the Ruins of Life if you’re not\na Trainer?[VAR 0114(0009)]
3	Oh. Because of Nebby...\c\nIt’s not originally from here, and I want to help\nit get back to its home...\c\nBut I don’t have any idea how to do that...\c\nIt seems fond of the ruins for some reason,\nso I keep visiting them and hoping that maybe\r\nI will find some clue to help it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Pew?
5	You certainly don’t see Pokémon like that\nevery day.\c\nTapu Lele may be called the guardian deity of\nour island, but it can also run wild at times.\c\nRegular Pokémon normally avoid the guardians\nat all costs...\c\nUnless they are strong enough to face the\ntapu themselves, that is.[VAR 0114(0009)]
6	Wait, that can’t be right...[VAR 0114(0009)]
7	I think your journey will hold many surprises.\nAnd I hope it holds many joys.[VAR 0114(0009)]
8	I’ll take you back to town, Lillie.\c\nYou’re doing everything you can for your\npartner, even though you’re not a Trainer.\c\nI like that kind of person, so I can’t help but\ngive you a hand![VAR 0114(0009)]
174

1	Oh, hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nGuess what?\c\nThis weird green guy from Aether told me to\ncome to Hano Grand Resort once I finished up\r\nwith my grand trial here on Akala.\c\nCrazy, right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
2	Ooh, the Aether Foundation?\c\nI’m not sure what he wants with you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], but why not go find out?\c\nIf you don’t want to keep him waiting, then\nCharizard should get you there in no time.\c\nThe Hano Grand Resort lies just over the bridge\nnear the Dimensional Research Lab.[VAR 0114(0009)]
3	Th...the Aether Foundation...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	U-um! I think I’ll stay here.\nI’d like to see how Hau’s battle goes, too.\c\nEven though I hate to see Pokémon get hurt...\c\nBut I know that both of your Pokémon are\ndedicated to battling beside you two.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	I may not be as strong as my gramps, Hala...\c\nBut I can still raise up [VAR 0101(0001)] and the\nrest of my team to do their best![VAR 0114(0007)]

0	So you’ve come at last.[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	Ah. But forgive me.\nI have yet to introduce myself.\c\nYou may call me Faba.\c\nI told you before that I would show you\nsomeplace astounding, right? Well, that\r\nwondrous place is...[VAR FF00(0001)]Aether Paradise[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0030)]
2	Let me tell you about Aether Paradise.\c\nJust as the name suggests, Aether Paradise is a\nveritable paradise for Pokémon that floats far\r\nout in the sea surrounding Alola.\c\nIt is an artificial island, made entirely by human\ntechnology, for the protecting of Pokémon!\c\nOf course I’m an adult who keeps his promises.\nSo I will prove to you that all I’ve told you is the\r\nabsolute truth with a tour of Aether Paradise.\c\nYou will come, won’t you?![VAR 0114(0015)]
3	Good, good. Then you’ll come with me.\nAether Paradise will amaze you.[VAR 0114(0015)]
4	Hmm. Yes.\c\nWell, children are often too frivolous and\naimless to properly think through—\r\nAhem. I mean they value their freedom so.\c\nBut the answer that I want to hear from you is\na resounding “Yes!” Now let’s hear it![VAR 0114(0015)]
5	Wait!\nTake me, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
6	Oh?\nEven Kahuna Olivia has come to see you off?[VAR 0114(0015)]
7	As a kahuna, I look after all the trial-goers who\ncome to my island. They’re like my own children.\c\nNot that I’ve got any—I’ve never even\ngotten married.[VAR 0114(0009)]
8	Listen up, you two.\c\nYour greatest opponent is always yourself.\nYour greatest allies, the Pokémon beside you.[VAR 0114(0009)]
9	Thanks!\c\nAre you coming, too, Professor?[VAR 0114(0007)]
10	I’ve got my own business to attend to.\c\nYou go see all the amazing tech that Aether’s\ndeveloping and tell me about it later, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
11	That’s right. I’ll see you on the next island...\c\nUla’ula Island, yeah?\nThen let’s meet up at Malie Garden![VAR 0114(0005)]
12	Yup! It’s good-bye, Akala Island!\c\nThough I guess we can come back anytime\nwe want to, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
13	Then let us enjoy an adventure upon that grand\nvessel that will take us across the high seas!\c\nBy which I mean to say, the ferry.[VAR 0114(0015)]
176
0	Can you believe a big hunk of iron like Aether\nParadise can float in the sea?!\c\nAnd it’s all cuz of the Pokémon holding it up.\nDid you know that, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0007)]
1	I knew that
2	Really?!

2	Downstairs, our teams work on developing new\nPoké Balls and more.\c\nYes, all for the sake of Pokémon conservation.[VAR 0114(0015)]
3	Though you will not be able to use any of your\nPoké Balls within Aether Paradise.\c\nA jamming signal is broadcast throughout the\nfacility to prevent them from functioning.[VAR 0114(0015)]

4	Phew...[VAR 0114(0030)]
5	Welcome to Aether Paradise,\n[VAR 0100(0000)] and Hau.\c\nMy name is Wicke.[VAR 0114(0016)]
6	Nice to meet you

8	Wait? You know who we are?\nHow’d you know that?![VAR 0114(0007)]
9	One of our employees told me about your\nmeeting on Akala Island.\c\nAnd of course I heard how you helped protect\nthe Pokémon there, too, young Mr. Hau.\c\nThank you very much![VAR 0114(0016)]
10	Let me show you around.\nThe main entrance is up above us.[VAR 0114(0016)]

2	Yeah, I am
3	How’d you know?
4	Yeah, I took the first chance I had to join\nin the island challenge once I turned 11!\c\n’Cause, someday, I really want to be able to\nbeat my gramps...but he’s way too strong![VAR 0114(0007)]
5	How...how lovely for you.\c\nI suppose all children must yearn to take a\njourney of their own choosing when they get\r\nto be about your age.\c\nThough you’re hardly just children anymore.\nTrainers are like parents to their Pokémon![VAR 0114(0016)]
6	[VAR 0100(0000)]. Hau.\c\nWould you two like to see the conservation\narea upstairs?[VAR 0114(0016)]

0	Aether Paradise is a safe haven for all Pokémon.\c\nFor this reason, the use of Poké Balls is strictly\nforbidden within the conservation area.
1	Wow![VAR 0114(0007)]
2	We keep Pokémon that have been targeted by\nTeam Skull here...[VAR 0114(0016)]
3	And we also try to support Pokémon that need\na little extra protection.\c\nLike Corsola, for example. They are quite terribly\noverhunted by a Pokémon called Toxapex.[VAR 0114(0016)]
4	I hope you don’t mind if I read a passage from\nmy Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0016)]
5	“Toxapex...\c\n“Toxapex crawls along the ocean floor on its\n12 legs. It leaves a trail of Corsola bits\r\nscattered in its wake.”[VAR 0114(0016)]
6	Yeah. My gramps is always saying that nature’s\ngot its cruel side, sure as it gives us blessings.[VAR 0114(0007)]
7	But can the Aether Foundation really protect\nall the Pokémon that’re out there?[VAR 0114(0007)]
8	Nature does have its own balance, of course.\c\nIt can be difficult to judge just how much we\nhumans should try to affect that, can’t it?[VAR 0114(0016)]
9	That’s pretty amazing!\nThe Aether Foundation seems awesome.\c\nBut why’d you bother setting up a branch in\na place like Alola?![VAR 0114(0007)]
10	I couldn’t say...\c\nIt’s hard to know for sure what our president\nis thinking sometimes.[VAR 0114(0016)]
11	If you’d like to meet President Lusamine, she\nshould be here in the conservation area now.[VAR 0114(0016)]
183
0	This is where we look after the Pokémon that\nare commonly known as “regional variants.”[VAR 0114(0016)]
1	There are several species of Pokémon that\nseem to have adapted to the Alola region.\c\nThey have different appearances, and even\ntypes, in Alola than they do in other regions.[VAR 0114(0016)]
2	What is it in the climate and features of this \nregion that is affecting the Pokémon?\c\nWe are trying to determine that by testing\ndifferent parameters such as the local soil,\r\nwater, and temperature.[VAR 0114(0016)]
3	We’ve been aided in our research by Professor\nOak, who is in Ula’ula, among others...[VAR 0114(0016)]
4	Oh yeah, I remember!\c\nThe Meowth in your house is different from the\nones in Alola, isn’t it, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0007)]
5	Yeah
6	It is?
7	So that’s why! I never knew that Alola was\nso cool like that. Regional variants, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
8	Ha ha ha! OK, next time we’re back home,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], we should compare Meowth![VAR 0114(0007)]
9	Let me show you the next area.[VAR 0114(0016)]
10	If you’d like to meet President Lusamine,\nshe’s here in the conservation area now.[VAR 0114(0016)]
11	Wow, there are even Pokémon that got done in\nby Team Skull, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]

2	You must be [VAR 0100(0000)] and Hau.\c\nWelcome to Aether Paradise.\nThe Aether Foundation’s own private island.[VAR 0114(0030)]
3	You must be [VAR 0100(0000)] and Hau.\c\nWelcome to Aether Paradise.\nThe Aether Foundation’s own private island.[VAR 0114(0030)]
4	I am the president of the foundation.\nBut please, just call me Lusamine.\c\nI’m so glad that we got to meet.[VAR 0114(0014)]
5	I’m glad there are people like you, who travel\nthe islands to learn more about Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0014)]
6	But there are also those unfortunate\npeople who harm Pokémon for their\r\nown selfish reasons or even for profit.[VAR 0114(0014)]
7	And that is why I am here.\c\nI will be like a mother to all of those poor\nPokémon and shower them with love.[VAR 0114(0014)]
8	Even Pokémon from distant worlds, far from\nthe Alola region, are worthy of my love.[VAR 0114(0014)]
9	Wow, Miss Lusamine!\c\nI don’t know how you do all this!\nYou’re, like, not even that much older than us![VAR 0114(0007)]
10	Oh, you sweet boy![VAR 0114(0014)]
11	I’m already over 40![VAR 0114(0014)]
12	You are?[VAR 0114(0007)]
13	Wait, WHAT?![VAR 0114(0007)]
14	Oh, you!\c\nThe right style does wonders, you know.\nAnd, Hau, your style is a bit wanting, hm?\c\nI’ll have to take you out sometime and\nhelp you pick a smashing outfit.[VAR 0114(0014)]
15	L-like what you wear?\c\nI don’t think anyone else could pull off that kind\nof look! Except maybe Lillie...[VAR 0114(0007)]
16	Oh, don’t you worry.\nYou just leave everything up to me.\c\nTrust me—children would all be much happier if\nthey’d only listen to the adults around them.[VAR 0114(0014)]

2	What?\nMiss Lusamine, did you say something?[VAR 0114(0007)]
3	That creature we just saw was undoubtedly an\nUltra Beast...\c\nAn unknown being from another dimension that\nsuddenly appears from the Ultra Wormhole...[VAR 0114(0014)]
4	It looked like it was suffering...\nLike it pained it to be in this strange place...\c\nI can’t bear to see that happen!\nI will save it. And I will love it![VAR 0114(0014)]
5	Thank you...both of you...\nThank you so much![VAR 0114(0014)]

1	O-oh! At once, ma’am![VAR 0114(0016)]
2	I will go to check that none of our poor resident\nPokémon came to any harm.\c\nAnd I need to speak with Mr. Faba about\nexactly what happened downstairs.[VAR 0114(0014)]
3	And of course...\c\nI will have to start preparing the foundation for\nour newest and perhaps greatest duty yet:\r\nthe protection of the Ultra Beasts![VAR 0114(0014)]

1	I don’t know if what happened should be\nrightly described as an accident, but...\r\nI think it’s probably best if you do so.\c\nAnyway, I was very glad to get to meet you \nboth. Please take this to remember your visit.\c\nSome malasadas for Hau...[VAR 0114(0016)]
2	Yes! Big Malasadas! Awesome!\c\nIsn’t it crazy how malasadas taste even better\nwhen you eat ’em together with someone else?[VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Yes... I think I know what you mean.\c\nMeals always taste better when you share them\nwith the ones you love.\c\nAnd for you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nA TM for the move Psychic...[VAR 0114(0016)]

4	Why?
5	I want my Pokémon to get a deep breath of\nthis fresh new air!\c\nDon’t worry. I’ll make sure both our teams are\nin fighting form first.[VAR 0114(0007)]
6	Bwah! That battle took my breath away!\nI can’t breathe the fresh air that way![VAR 0114(0007)]

8	What? I mean, yes, it is.\nBut when you say your father...\r\nIsn’t this book...very old?[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	Yeah, it belonged to my dad.\c\nI know I don’t look it, but my family used to be\npretty much royalty.[VAR 0114(0011)]
10	I had to have all my dad’s books moved here\nso they didn’t get ruined by the Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0011)]
11	I can tell you lots of other old stories about\nAlola, too! You interested?[VAR 0114(0011)]

5	That’s it! Right there! On the peak of Lanakila!\nThat’s where I’ll establish our Pokémon League![VAR 0114(0005)]
6	We’ll get everybody who’s finished their island\nchallenges, yeah, and up there on the peak of\r\nMount Lanakila, they’ll battle against the\r\nkahunas to become the island\r\nchallenge champion!\c\nI’ve always valued our old traditions here in\nAlola, but it’s time to make a Champion the\r\nwhole world will recognize!\c\nIt’s time to get our own Elite Four and make our\nown Pokémon League![VAR 0114(0005)]
7	To think that, someday, the kiddos in Alola will\nbe able to go from being the island challenge\r\nchampion to the world Champion!\c\nAnd then, when we have our own Champion,\nthey can show the rest of the world what’s so\r\nspecial about Alolan Pokémon and their\r\nTrainers, yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]

1	You’re still as fired up as ever, eh, “Royal”?[VAR 0114(0030)]
2	Ha! [VAR 0100(0000)], lemme introduce you.\nThis is Molayne.\c\nHe runs the observatory here, and also\nmanages PC boxes, but he’s not\r\nHokulani’s captain.[VAR 0114(0005)]
3	But I was the captain once, my masked friend.[VAR 0114(001C)]
4	It’s [VAR 0100(0000)], right? Thanks for coming\nall the way up Hokulani to visit us.\c\nBut our Captain Sophocles is a busy young man.\c\nAlways calculating comets’ paths or working on\nthat Festival Plaza thing of his...[VAR 0114(001C)]
5	So I’ll just determine whether you’re qualified to\ntake on the trial.[VAR 0114(001C)]
6	I’ll heal your team first, of course.[VAR 0114(001C)]
7	I’ll gladly show you the skills of a Trainer who\ntoughened up while adventuring alongside\r\nKukui back in the day![VAR 0114(001C)]
8	Well, well, you certainly seem qualified to take\non the trial.[VAR 0114(001C)]
9	Yeah, I think [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she’s even stronger than we were\nat this point of our island challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
10	One more thing, cousin—the name’s Kukui!\nWho’s this Masked Royal you’re talking about?![VAR 0114(0005)]
11	All right, cousin, I’m heading back to\nMalie Garden.\c\nI figure Hau should be done eating malasada by\nnow, yeah?\c\nI’ll make sure he makes it up here, too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
12	That guy’s as interesting as ever. My old buddy![VAR 0114(001C)]

0	You summon the Totem Pokémon and prove\nyour strength to it...\c\nThat’s what every trial boils down to, right?[VAR 0114(0010)]
1	So I thought...\c\nWhy not just call the totem here from\nthe start?[VAR 0114(0010)]
2	So I tried a bit of this and that, and I think I’ve\nwhipped up a little device to call the\r\nTotem Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0010)]
3	Perhaps you’re wondering why I built\na machine?\c\nHere at the observatory, we also monitor\nsounds that we detect from outer space.\c\nThere are some sounds that are inaudible to\npeople but Pokémon can hear just fine.[VAR 0114(0010)]
4	We broadcast the sounds we have gathered\nterrestrially and monitor the reactions\r\nof Pokémon.\c\nThe machine that summons the Totem Pokémon\nmakes use of this technology...[VAR 0114(0010)]
5	Utilizing other sounds we have gathered, we\nalso developed a security system here...\r\nBut that was actually Big Mo’s invention.[VAR 0114(0010)]
6	Just so you know...\c\nThis will actually be my first time trying it out,\nso I’m glad you came. I needed a test subject.[VAR 0114(0010)]
7	Ping Totem Pokémon 2.0, engage![VAR 0114(0010)]
8	Now the totem should—[VAR 0114(0010)]

11	Oww! Did the door close?! Let’s see, we’ll need\nto turn off the security system to get the\r\ndoor open...[VAR 0114(0010)]
12	You’ll have to pass an audio quiz! [VAR 0114(0010)]
13	I-it’s fine.\nI definitely feel a powerful presence.\c\nIt’s coming now.\c\nThe Totem Pokémon is coming.[VAR 0114(0010)]

4	It seems that your Ping Totem Pokémon 2.0\nuses too much electricity.\c\nIf we can get a little assistance from Charjabug,\nwe should be able to make some improvements.[VAR 0114(001C)]
5	Here, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI’ll give you this Electrium Z to reward you for\nbeating the Totem Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0010)]
6	You watching?[VAR 0114(0010)]
7	I was fine when the power was off. Geez... Now\nthat you can see me, I feel all nervous... I’m not\r\nsure what to say.\c\nThanks? Or, uh, congratulations? You passed\nmy trial.[VAR 0114(0010)]

2	Don’t you worry. I’m sure that I made the right\nchoice in naming you captain.\c\nEven if you are my cousin.[VAR 0114(001C)]
3	Usually it’s the island kahuna who appoints\nthe captains.\c\nBut there are some, er, unusual circumstances\nhere on Ula’ula.[VAR 0114(001C)]
4	So somehow I ended up captain...[VAR 0114(0010)]
5	But you were really great, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0010)]
6	I see...\nThen let me reward you![VAR 0114(001C)]
7	This is one of the Z-Crystals that I collected\nlong ago during my own island challenge to\r\nprove my strength and that of my Pokémon.\c\nSo it seems fitting that it go from me to you.\nTake it, and use it well.[VAR 0114(001C)]
8	And if we’re done here, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nCould I ask you to do a favor for me?\r\nProfessor Kukui forgot this.[VAR 0114(001C)]
9	He said he would be going back to Malie Garden.\nCould you take it to him?[VAR 0114(001C)]
10	Maybe next time we can battle...[VAR 0114(0010)]
220
0	Come on! Hurry it up, yo!\nWe’ve gotta get to Malie Garden, quick![VAR 0114(0031)]
1	Yeah! We’re gonna end that fool Kukui once and\nfor all![VAR 0114(0032)]
221
0	Yo, yo, yo!\nHold up, yo, Mr. Kukui![VAR 0114(0031)]
1	You say you wanna make a Pokémon League?\nYou got rocks in your skull?[VAR 0114(0032)]
2	Four turns![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	Huh?[VAR 0114(0031)]
4	Bring it on, the both of you! I’ve been\nresearching Pokémon moves, yeah, so I’m\r\nalways ready, oh yeah!\c\nI’ll take you both on in a Battle Royal, and you’ll\nbe down with just a Swift and Incinerate or two!\c\nYou gotta beat the man to be the man, boys![VAR 0114(0005)]
5	Yo, for real?[VAR 0114(0031)]
6	F-fine! You asked for it![VAR 0114(0032)]
7	Get ’em good, Professor!
8	You numskulls should learn your place!
9	Battle Royal, huh? Nice idea there, Kukui.\nYou can beat down three Pokémon at\r\nonce, huh?[VAR 0114(0030)]
10	It’s Guzma...
11	The boss has graced us with his presence![VAR 0114(0031)]
222
0	The hated boss who beats you down, and beats\nyou down, and never lets up...\r\nYeah. Big bad Guzma is here![VAR 0114(0017)]
1	Greetings, cowering public![VAR 0114(0017)]
2	We have an exciting bout for you tonight! In the\nopposing corner, the Pokémon professor Kukui!\r\nAnd in this corner, the boss of Team Skull and\r\nthe hardest guy around, Guzma![VAR 0114(0017)]
223
0	Here we are, Kukui...\c\nFellow rejects who never could\nbecome captains.[VAR 0114(0017)]
1	We’ve got all these moldy old\ntraditions in Alola—the kahunas, the captains...\c\nIt’s about time we cut out all that silly garbage\nand make something new for ourselves.\r\nTrust me, I get that.[VAR 0114(0017)]
2	Don’t get me wrong, though, Kukui.\nWe’ve got no need for a Pokémon League.\c\nAfter all, everyone already knows who the\nstrongest Trainer is on these islands![VAR 0114(0017)]
3	Speak for yourself, Guzma.\c\nIt’s not like I couldn’t become a captain.\nI chose not to. I had other dreams, see?[VAR 0114(0005)]
4	I wanted to figure out which moves would\nbe strong enough to beat old Hala...\r\nand I finally found what I was looking for.\c\nThe strongest moves you can use are the ones\na Trainer and their Pokémon choose together...\r\nin the heat of the moment, when it really counts.[VAR 0114(0005)]
5	That’s when I knew I had to make a Pokémon\nLeague, yeah, to give everybody a chance to be\r\npushed to the limit with their team and find that\r\nperfect move!\c\nLet’s see it, Guzma! Show me your moves and\nprove you aren’t just all talk!\c\nIf you really can, that is...[VAR 0114(0005)]
6	Right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nDon’t you agree?[VAR 0114(0005)]
7	That’s right
8	What?
9	So you’re one of the kids on h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser island\nchallenge? You don’t look like Hala’s grandson.[VAR 0114(0017)]
10	This here’s [VAR 0100(0000)].\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe just moved to Alola recently.\c\nDiscovery! New experiences! Adventure!\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s loving every minute of it![VAR 0114(0005)]
11	[VAR 0100(0000)] and h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser [VAR 0101(0001)] can\nunleash some real powerful moves.\c\nSo if you think you’re the strongest Trainer on\nthese islands, Guzma, why don’t you battle h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer?[VAR 0114(0005)]
12	Tch! This move fanatic is getting me all riled up![VAR 0114(0017)]
13	You’ve got a Z-Ring, huh, kid?[VAR 0114(0017)]
14	Why even bother with the island challenge?\nWhat’s the point of it?[VAR 0114(0017)]
15	It’ll make me strong
16	That’s what I want to find out
17	No it won’t, you dumb kid!\c\nWatch closely, Kukui.\c\nSomeday I’m gonna destroy you.\nBut first, I’ll destroy everything you care about![VAR 0114(0017)]
18	Ha! You don’t even know why you’re doing it.\c\nWatch closely, Kukui.\c\nSomeday I’m gonna destroy you.\nBut first, I’ll destroy everything you care about![VAR 0114(0017)]
19	Wanna see what destruction looks like?\nHere it is in human form—it’s your boy Guzma![VAR 0114(0017)]
20	Guzma!!!\nWhat is wrong with you?!\c\nNow’s the time for your vaunted team to let\nloose and destroy everything![VAR 0114(0017)]
21	It was [VAR 0100(0000)], right?\c\nI’ll remember you...as someone I’ll be happy\nto beat down anytime![VAR 0114(0017)]
22	Don’t mess with the boss, yo!\nYou don’t want him to get serious![VAR 0114(0031)]
23	Team Skull will have to go lick their wounds now!\nGetting beat by a child just doing h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser trials!
24	Aue, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou are one righteous Trainer!
224
0	Woo, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
1	Those were some nice moves!\nI can feel my soul shaking![VAR 0114(0005)]
2	Oh yeah! I almost forgot to give you something\nsuper important!\c\nHere you go, cousin. This is the Z-Crystal for\n[VAR 0101(0002)]...\r\nThe Evolution of the [VAR 0101(0001)]\r\nyou chose![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	And, uh, about that mask you’ve got there,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nMolayne gave you that, yeah?\c\nI’ll take it, if you don’t mind. I can make sure it\ngets back to the Masked Royal safe and sound...[VAR 0114(0005)]
4	You handed the mask to the professor!
5	So what happened to Lillie?\nYou lose her somewhere, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
6	I’m right here.[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	And so is Acerola![VAR 0114(0011)]
8	And Hau is...probably at a malasada shop\nsomewhere, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
9	You and the professor fought those horrible\nTeam Skull thugs, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\r\nJust thinking about it makes me worry...\r\nThey sound like a scary group...[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	You think? I don’t know. Exchanging a few\nmoves in battle is the quickest way to get to\r\nknow someone in my book.[VAR 0114(0005)]
11	Well, I’m going to head up Mount Lanakila.\c\nI’ve gotta make sure the Pokémon League gets\nfinished and everybody has the chance to find\r\ntheir own perfect move!\c\nKeep training hard on your island challenge,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], and one day you’ll make\r\nit there![VAR 0114(0005)]
12	[VAR 0100(0000)]...\nBe sure you’re not pushing yourself too hard.[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou made it through Sophocles’s trial, huh?\c\nThat’s really great!\nYou can take on the next trial up past Route 11.\r\nThrough Tapu Village, you know?\c\nIf you get lost on your way, ask a police officer\nfor directions. They’re here to serve, right?[VAR 0114(0011)]
14	Now, Lillie, you’re coming with me to do\nsome shopping![VAR 0114(0011)]
225
0	Greetings, trial-goer.\c\nLet me check your collection of Z-Crystals.
1	It looks like you haven’t yet earned your\nElectrium Z, have you?\c\nTake the bus that leaves from Route 10, and\ncomplete the trial that awaits you at the\r\nHokulani Observatory!
2	Ho! Look at that blinding yellow Electrium Z!
3	Now I guess I’ll have to open the gate for you!
4	What you face up ahead is the Ghost-type trial.\nI hope you enjoy it!
5	Haina Desert...\nIt’s a pretty fun place, don’t you think?
226
0	Greetings, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000B)]
1	Well met!\nI was seeking you.\c\nIf you’re going to travel about Ula’ula, you\nought to do it while astride a Mudsdale.\c\nThere is no call for hesitation.\nConsider it my thanks for Akala Island.[VAR 0114(000B)]
2	Mudsdale was registered to your Ride Pager!
3	It was remiss of me not to register her\nfor you when we met one another in Malie.\c\nI was just so taken aback by Lillie and how\nlovely she was that it escaped me.\c\nBy no means was I just waiting for a time when\nyou were in trouble![VAR 0114(000B)]
4	Ni-hiii!
5	If you seek the next trial, go straight\non through here to Tapu Village.\c\nI’ll be cheering for you on your island challenge![VAR 0114(000B)]
227
0	[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	I heard the news from Sophocles!\c\nYou helped him out with testing da kine, yeah?\nThat totem-calling machine or whatever?\c\nI guess I was test subject number two!\nBut I managed to get through the trial.\r\nMaybe even managed to get a bit stronger, eh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
2	Here, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI want you to take this![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	You only have one volume, don’t you?\c\nHaven’t you ever heard the expression that\nsilence is golden?[VAR 0114(0013)]
4	Gah! He’s back![VAR 0114(0007)]
5	Listen, Team Skull is looking for a Pokémon\ncalled Cosmog...\c\nDo you two know anything?[VAR 0114(0013)]
6	What?!\c\nN-not that we’d tell you![VAR 0114(0007)]
7	So you do know something.\c\nLook...\nCosmog isn’t even a strong Pokémon.\c\nBut it has the potential to summon Pokémon\nso terrifyingly strong that you don’t even know.\c\nIf something like that happened, it would be\na disaster for Alola...[VAR 0114(0013)]
8	A disaster? Like...a real disaster?\nThen what’re we supposed to do about it?[VAR 0114(0007)]
9	Protect it! If you do know where Cosmog is\nor if you do find anything out...just keep it safe!\c\nI know I might be working for Team Skull right\nnow, so you may not trust me or care but...\r\nI’m going to tell you this just once.\c\nYou have to protect Cosmog...\nno matter what![VAR 0114(0013)]
10	I still don’t even understand how Team Skull\nfound out about Cosmog in the first place...[VAR 0114(0013)]
11	What do you mean? No matter what?\nYou just gonna leave us hanging?![VAR 0114(0007)]
12	[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nIf they’re really looking for Cosmog, then...\nIs Lillie gonna be OK?[VAR 0114(0007)]
13	I don’t really get what’s going on, but we’ve\njust got to keep both of them safe, right?!\c\nThen I know what I’m gonna do...\nTake on my next trial so I can get even stronger![VAR 0114(0007)]
14	I’m gonna complete my island challenge, and I’m\ngonna get Tapu Koko to recognize my strength,\r\nthen I’m gonna be the next island kahuna!\c\nI want to make sure more and more people can\nhave fun battling to see who wins or loses! \c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s both try to become real champions![VAR 0114(0007)]
228
0	Greetings, trial-goer!\nI’m afraid this is a captain’s barricade.\c\nOnly those who pass the Ghost-type trial\ncan come through here.
1	Ho! That’s Ghostium Z right there!\c\nThen let me just get this thing out of the way\nfor you! One second...
2	Beyond this gate stretches the great expanse\nof Haina Desert.\r\nIt’s a bit different every day, due to the winds.
3	Oh, hey! Um, if you’ve got one to spare...\nthink you could front me a Fresh Water?
4	Oh! Thanks, friend!\nHere, let me give you these in return.\c\nThey’re Adrenaline Orbs.\c\nDon’t you feel like the Pokémon that other\nPokémon call to help them in battle are, like,\r\nstronger? And even more likely to be Shiny?
5	My partner is a Poliwhirl with the Water Absorb\nAbility, so it loves a little dousing now and then.
6	Well, thanks for wanting to help!\nBut it looks like you don’t have a Fresh Water.\c\nIf you remember me, hopefully you can bring me\none next time you’re passing through here!
7	I get it! Your Fresh Waters are precious to you.\c\nBut if you remember me, maybe you can bring\nan extra for me next time!
8	Po...
9	Whirrrrrrlll!!!

0	Phew... Look, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nSeems like we’re almost to the Aether House,\nwhere the captain is supposed to be, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
1	Hey, look! Construction workers!\nThat must be what Kukui was talking about!\c\nSo they’re really making a Pokémon League\nup on top of Mount Lanakila...[VAR 0114(0007)]
2	The professor told me that Pokémon Leagues\nin other regions have four crazy-strong Trainers\r\nin them that they call the Elite Four![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	The Elite Four and our island kahunas...\nI wonder which ones are stronger!\r\nI can’t wait to find out![VAR 0114(0007)]
231
0	Wait up, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nSo, this is the Aether House, eh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
1	Strangers!
2	This means battle!
3	What? Why?![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	We’ll protect our home when Acerola’s away!
5	I tried really hard! I am a kid, you know!
6	Phew... So I won, yeah?\nThen why’s this little fellow still gnawing on me?[VAR 0114(0007)]
7	Grrrssssss!
8	I’m ba-a-ack, everybody![VAR 0114(0011)]
9	Ha ha ha! Looks like I finished up my shopping\nspree right on time!\c\nYou’ve already met everyone?[VAR 0114(0011)]
10	Oh yeah, we met all right...\nIn battle anyway.\c\nBut...\nHey, where’s Lillie?[VAR 0114(0007)]
11	I left her with Hapu.\nThey should be coming soon.[VAR 0114(0011)]
12	So why don’t we get those trials done first?\nYou did know I’m the captain, right?[VAR 0114(0011)]
13	These ankle biters are starting to grow on me.\c\nI think I might hang out for a while.\nIt’s kinda soothing, you know?[VAR 0114(0007)]
14	My trial takes place at the abandoned site\nwhere the supermarket used to be.\c\nI’ll wait out front of Aether House to show you\nthe way, if you’d like![VAR 0114(0011)]
15	Everybody lives together with Pokémon here at\nAether House.
16	The Aether Fun-day-shun pays for everything!
232
0	What do you think you’re doing?!\nStop it! Stop it right now![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	For real, girl?!\c\nYour bag was moving! Right in front of my eyes!\nAnd I’m just supposed to ignore that?!
2	If you’ve got some rare Pokémon in there, I’m\ngonna have to take it and make some cash!\c\nEven if it’s not that rare of a Pokémon, I bet\nI could still get paid, yo.
3	[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Oh, so we’re following that script, are we?\nA Trainer dashes forward to save the girl, huh?\r\nI’m not gonna let you be the hero in this scene!
5	When I saw that adorable Drowzee, that was\nenough for me! Later!
6	[~ 6]
7	Phew...\nThank you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	I just wanted to go for a stroll on my own,\nto see what it must feel like to be a Trainer...\r\nSo Hapu and I went our separate ways...\r\nbut then Nebby tried to get out of my bag...[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	Didn’t you! Go on, you little troublemaker...\nYou’d better thank [VAR 0100(0000)], too![VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Pew!
11	Oh, and...um.\c\nWhen I was out shopping, I kept thinking about\nhow I wanted to be some help to you during\r\nyour island challenge...and then I saw these.[VAR 0114(0006)]
12	I bought them without even thinking![VAR 0114(0006)]
233
0	Oh! Lillie![VAR 0114(0011)]
1	What’s the matter? You look all worn out.\nDo you want to rest at Aether House awhile?[VAR 0114(0011)]
2	Oh, Acerola... \nThank you! I think I might take you up on that.[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	And you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWe can reach my trial site from Tapu Village.\c\nCome on, follow me![VAR 0114(0011)]
4	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nDo your best to become a real champion![VAR 0114(0006)]

6	Here we are!\nClimb up these steps and my trial begins![VAR 0114(0011)]
234
0	The time has finally come, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0011)]
1	So, I guess I should explain what kind of trial\nthis is, huh?[VAR 0114(0011)]
2	This old building is full of lots of Ghost-type\nPokémon. Did you know?\c\nHere’s where the trial part comes in.\c\nYou’ve got to find the Totem Pokémon of this\nsite and snap a shot of it with a Poké Finder![VAR 0114(0011)]
3	The totem is a bit of a trickster, and it likes to\nplay hide-and-seek and mess around.\c\nIf you take pictures of the other Ghost-type\nPokémon inside, it’ll definitely come out to get\r\nin on the fun and have its photo taken, too![VAR 0114(0011)]
4	So, if you see something weird happening inside\nthis old place, try to check it out.\c\nI bet you’ll find a Ghost-type Pokémon causing\nthe mischief, so get its photo before it’s gone![VAR 0114(0011)]
5	I’ll just borrow your Poké Finder for a sec.\c\nHee hee!\nAnd your Rotom is a Ghost type, too![VAR 0114(0011)]
6	We just do this, and...[VAR 0114(0011)]
7	There! I’ve set it up to use a special shooting\nmode just for this trial.\c\nYou’ll only be able to use it at this site, though.[VAR 0114(0011)]
8	As soon as you enter the building, your trial\nwill begin. Got it?\c\nAnd you can’t catch any of the Pokémon, either.\c\nAnd you can’t leave without giving up, too, so\nmake sure you’re ready for anything![VAR 0114(0011)]
9	As soon as you enter the building, your trial\nwill begin. Got it?\c\nAnd you can’t catch any of the Pokémon, either.\c\nAlso, you can’t leave without giving up, so make\nsure you’re ready for anything![VAR 0114(0011)]
235
0	A conveyor belt started moving all by itself!
1	The conveyor belt is moving all on its own.\c\nDo you want to fire up the Poké Finder?
2	A shopping cart started moving all on its own!
3	The shopping cart is moving all on its own!\c\nDo you want to fire up the Poké Finder?
4	Those dolls are moving all by themselves!
5	The dolls are moving all by themselves!\c\nDo you want to fire up the Poké Finder?
6	You can hear Acerola from the outside!
7	You want to give up on my trial?[VAR 0114(0011)]
8	Got it!\c\nThen make sure you’re ready and try again![VAR 0114(0011)]
9	You want to give up on my trial?[VAR 0114(0011)]
10	The door is locked!
11	You didn’t do a thing, but the lock clicked open!
12	Got it! Then do your best![VAR 0114(0011)]
13	Nothing seems to be wrong with the conveyor\nbelt now...[VAR 0114(0011)]
14	Nothing seems to be wrong with the shopping\ncart now...
15	Nothing seems to be wrong with the display of\ndolls now...
16	Oh no! The Pokémon spotted you!
17	Oh dearie me... Zzt, zzt, zzt, what a shame...\c\nWhy don’t you have another look around?\nIf you find any Pokémon, snap a shot of ’em\r\nzoomed in and right in the center, zzt-zzt![VAR 0114(0035)]
18	You need some advice, [VAR 1100(00FF,0B07)]big boyclever girl?\c\nStart by having a look around to find any of\nthose tricky Pokémon hiding about, zzt-zzt.\c\nWhen you spot one, lock your Finder on it so\nthe Pokémon is right in the middle of your shot!\r\nThen snap a nice close-up of the pest, zzt-zzt![VAR 0114(0035)]
19	Looks like the Pokémon you’re supposed to\nsnap like to play hide-and-seek, zzz-zzt!\c\nHave a look around this old place, and if you\nfind a Pokémon, zoom in on it and snap a shot\r\nwith it right up and centered in your Finder! Zzt![VAR 0114(0035)]
236
0	You can feel a pair of eyes sizing you up...\c\nThe Poké Finder fired up all on its own!
1	Seeeeee meee?!
2	Mimikyu disappeared somewhere...
3	A picture was added to your Poké Finder!\c\nThere is a fuzzy image of Mimikyu caught in\nthe picture!
4	I’m picking up signzzz of some kinda life-form\nfrom behind us, kiddo...\c\nBut I can’t identify what it is... Zrmmmm...[VAR 0114(0035)]
237
0	Welcome back, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI can check your pictures right away.\c\nNow let’s see how you did...[VAR 0114(0011)]
1	Yup! That’s Mimikyu all right!\c\nIt’s pretty hard to catch it on film, so this is a\nreally great attempt!\c\nWhich means...[VAR 0114(0011)]
2	You received a Z-Crystal from Acerola!
3	You obtained a Ghost-type Z-Crystal!\nThe Ghostium Z is yours!
4	If you want to use a Ghost-type Z-Power, then \nyou’ve got to move like this![VAR 0114(0011)]
5	And since you passed my trial, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nyou now have my permission to catch Pokémon\r\nin the trial site. So, in that old building there.\c\nHere you go![VAR 0114(0011)]
6	It’s not a bad idea to have some Ghost-type\nPokémon on your team![VAR 0114(0011)]
7	What’s that?\c\nYou say the Poké Finder just started up on its\nown, during your trial?\c\nOooh, cut it out, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou’re trying to scare me, huh?\c\nYou’ll have to come up with something a bit\nmore believable than that!\c\nThere’s not even any room in the back of that\nshop, for starters!\r\nHow gullible do you think I am?[VAR 0114(0011)]
8	Brrr!\nI feel like I’m getting chicken skin...\c\nLike a chill going through me for some reason...[VAR 0114(0011)]
238
0	Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou gave up last time in the middle of my\ntrial, huh? [VAR 0114(0011)]
1	The Ghost types in that old place are pretty\ntough to take on, huh?\c\nRemember that Ghost types are weak to other\nGhost types and Dark types, too!\c\nI’m sure you’ll make it this time!\nDon’t give up on my trial yet! I believe in you![VAR 0114(0011)]
2	Mimikyu is a pretty tough opponent, isn’t it?\c\nIt’s a Ghost- and Fairy-type Pokémon.\nDid you know?\c\nNeither type has a lot of weaknesses,\nso it’s tricky to beat.\c\nYou probably want to try Ghost- or Steel-type\nmoves against it.\c\nI’m sure you’ll beat it this time!\nDon’t give up on my trial yet! I believe in you![VAR 0114(0011)]

1	So, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou gave up on my trial last time, huh?[VAR 0114(0011)]
2	The Ghost types in that old place are pretty\ntough to take on, huh?\c\nRemember that Ghost types are weak to other\nGhost types and Dark types, too!\c\nI’m sure you’ll make it this time!\nDon’t give up on my trial yet! I believe in you![VAR 0114(0011)]
3	Mimikyu is a pretty tough opponent, isn’t it?\c\nIt’s a Ghost- and Fairy-type Pokémon.\nDid you know?\c\nNeither type has a lot of weaknesses,\nso it’s tricky to beat.\c\nYou probably want to try Ghost- or Steel-type\nmoves against it.\c\nI’m sure you’ll beat it this time!\nDon’t give up on my trial yet! I believe in you![VAR 0114(0011)]

0	That supermarket...\nIt was destroyed by our guardian deity.\r\nYup, that was Tapu Bulu all right.[VAR 0114(0011)]
1	This area used to be real important to people,\nbut some folks only thought of making money,\r\nso they went and built a store here...\c\nTapu Bulu may be all about growing things, but\nthis place isn’t what it wants to see growing.[VAR 0114(0011)]
2	Come on...\nLet’s go back to Aether House!\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)] must be waiting for us![VAR 0114(0011)]

1	It takes these dumb Grunts way too long to deal\nwith you kids...[VAR 0114(0018)]
2	So I guess it’s my turn now![VAR 0114(0018)]
3	What? I told you before.\c\nNext time you get in our way, I’m not holding\nanything back![VAR 0114(0018)]
4	Hmmph. Guess you are pretty tough.\c\nNow I understand why my Grunts waste so\nmuch time battling kids.[VAR 0114(0018)]
5	But if you want us to return the Pokémon, then\nyou’ll have to come to us.\c\nAlone.\c\nThe boss is dying to meet you, hmmph!\c\nSee you at our base in Po Town![VAR 0114(0018)]
6	Sorry...\nThere were too many of them for me to stop...[VAR 0114(0007)]
7	Ugh...\nBattles you can’t afford to lose aren’t any fun...[VAR 0114(0007)]
8	This him? The kahuna’s grandson?\nNo wonder he put up a decent fight!

1	We can’t forgive this![VAR 0114(0011)]
2	Darn it, those numskulls actually did something\npretty clever for once![VAR 0114(0011)]
3	If we want to get the Pokémon back...\c\nthen [VAR 0100(0000)] has to go to Po Town...\nAll alone? With no backup?\c\nThat’s what they said, but...that’s not fair![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	Team Skull has taken over Po Town...\nIt’s basically their private playground now.\c\nIf you’re gonna go, though, try to find this guy\non Route 15 who’s wearing a kimono...\r\nHe might be able to help you get to Po Town.[VAR 0114(0011)]
5	H-here. Take this...\nJust...just get my Yungoos back for me!
6	I feel so alone and scared without my Pokémon...\nI can’t sleep at night without her...
7	You’re gonna help us, aren’t you?\nYou’re strong, right?
8	You’re gonna help us, aren’t you?\nYou’re strong, right?
9	I-I’m sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)]. It’s my fault...\c\nNow you’ve got to put yourself in danger\nbecause...I couldn’t stop them...[VAR 0114(0007)]
10	Pokémon being abducted like that...\nMaybe even hurt...\r\nI just can’t stand the idea!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nPlease...help them![VAR 0114(0006)]
11	Pew...

0	Man oh man...\nWhat is going on today?\c\nSomeone actually bothered coming to this kind\nof sad place?[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	Well, no matter. I’ll take you on.\nKeep you company.\c\nTell me. Uncle Grimsley is going to flip a coin.\nWill it be heads or tails?[VAR 0114(0028)]
2	Heads
3	Tails
4	Neither
5	...Astonishing.\nYou just took a stab, like some kind of prophet.\c\nRight now, you and your Pokémon are shining\nbrilliantly.[VAR 0114(0028)]
6	...Astonishing.\c\nI had indeed been planning to have Skarmory\nsnatch it out of the air as it spun in the sky.[VAR 0114(0028)]
7	A loss is a loss.\c\nI’ll give you Sharpedo’s info for your Ride Pager\nthen. Ride it to victory.[VAR 0114(0028)]
8	Sharpedo was registered to your Ride Pager![VAR 0114(0028)]
9	Maybe you don’t need to hear this from me,\nbut I’m going to tell you anyway.\c\nIf you press  while riding on Sharpedo there,\nit’ll [VAR FF00(0001)]jet[VAR FF00(0000)] forward and smash through rocks\r\nlike those ones there.[VAR 0114(0028)]
10	And here’s a bit more unwanted advice.\c\nPo Town lies at the other end of Route 16 here.\nBut it’s thoroughly occupied by Team Skull.\c\nYou shouldn’t go there unless you want trouble.[VAR 0114(0028)]
11	If somebody wins a battle, then without doubt,\nsomeone else has lost the battle.\c\nThat’s the way of battle.\nI hope I might battle you someday.[VAR 0114(0028)]

10	I’m not the bad one here.\c\nThe real bad ones are whatever fools decided\nthat I’m bad!
11	I can never make Pokémon give it their all in\nbattles. I guess it’s my bad...
12	I’ve been thinking of how I can get my Pokémon\nto really bring out their power...\c\nIt’s not like I wanna work my fingers to the bone\ntrying to get strong, though.
13	Yo! If you wanna pass through here, then how\nabout you hand over $10,000,000?\c\nIf I had that much, I wouldn’t have to do\nanything anymore!\c\nWhat’s that? You don’t have it?\nThen I’ll take whatever you do have!

2	I may be an expert at studying Pokémon, but\nI’m no expert when it comes to battling them.
3	But the guys in Lab A next door...\nThey’re pretty experienced with battles.\c\nAfter all, they spent so long researching that\nuncontrollable Pokémon...
4	Hey. Focus, people.\nWhere’re Lillie and Cosmog?[VAR 0114(0007)]

9	Aether Report: Ultra Wormholes\c\nBeyond the Ultra Wormholes that Professor \nMohn discovered lies a different dimension.\c\nBy investigating the changes in mass there, we\ncan predict the existence of Pokémon-like life.\c\nWe have dubbed them Ultra Beasts for now.

2	If you stress it...\c\nIf you hurt it—is that what you mean?\c\nWas that why she ran away with it?[VAR 0114(0013)]

5	There should be plenty of beautiful beasts\nappearing all around Alola as we speak![VAR 0114(0014)]
6	Look!\nOn Akala and Poni...\c\nEven on Melemele Island![VAR 0114(0014)]

3	You’re right...[VAR 0114(0014)]
4	Guzma.\c\nQuiet those children for me.\c\nI don’t want to hear from them again.[VAR 0114(0014)]
5	I’ll stop the beast![VAR 0114(0013)]
6	My partner Null was born to be a beast killer![VAR 0114(0013)]

11	I took Nebby and ran away with it, but running\naway didn’t actually change anything...\c\nThis time I have to stand up to my mother and\nface her head on![VAR 0114(0006)]
12	I will give it everything I have!\nI’ll find my own kind of Z-Power![VAR 0114(0006)]

7	That’s why I’m going to try my hardest!\c\nThis is my Z-Powered form![VAR 0114(0006)]
8	So this is where you were.[VAR 0114(0013)]
9	I found this downstairs.[VAR 0114(0013)]
10	It’s the Sun Flute.\c\nIt’s apparently an artifact from Alola’s past.\c\nThey say it’s to be played under the\nsun’s light.[VAR 0114(0013)]
11	It’s the Moon Flute.\c\nIt’s apparently an artifact from Alola’s past.\c\nThey say it’s to be played under the\nmoon’s light.[VAR 0114(0013)]
12	The Sun Flute and the Moon Flute.\nWhen sounded together, it’s said that they can\r\ncall the Legendary Pokémon...\c\nThat is, if you believe in old myths, anyway.[VAR 0114(0013)]
13	Looks to me like that woman was even planning\nto add the Legendary Pokémon to her little\r\ncollection here.[VAR 0114(0013)]
14	Here. Take this with you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
15	It’s a Master Ball.\nIt can catch any Pokémon without fail.[VAR 0114(0013)]
16	I’m counting on you to help Lillie.\nThis is the least I can do.[VAR 0114(0013)]
17	But...what are you going to do, Gladion?[VAR 0114(0006)]
18	Deal with this mess.\nI’ve got to clean up Aether Paradise.[VAR 0114(0013)]
19	I’d wanted to get as far away from this place\nas I could, together with Null...\c\nbut in the end, it looks like I ended up right back\nhere again...[VAR 0114(0013)]
288
0	[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	Hey, and it’s Lillie...isn’t it?!\c\nWhat happened to you?![VAR 0114(0007)]
2	Yes, it’s me!\nNow I’m ready to use my full force, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
3	You look...fantastic![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	What was that?[VAR 0114(0013)]
5	I’m going to train even harder!\nI’ve gotta do more![VAR 0114(0007)]
6	I keep getting saved by [VAR 0100(0000)] and\nh[VAR 1100(0000,0202)]iser Pokémon, don’t I?[VAR 0114(0007)]
7	That’s not enough.\nI’ve gotta be able to save Pokémon on my own!\c\nIf I can’t do that, I’ll never be an island kahuna.\nI’ll never be able to make people really smile![VAR 0114(0007)]
8	And I still haven’t even done Acerola’s trial\nor anything. I’ve got a lot of catching up to do.[VAR 0114(0007)]
9	Sorry for dragging you into our family mess.[VAR 0114(0013)]
10	Yeah...\c\nBut we got to see things that almost no one\nwould ever get the chance to see!\c\nMaybe if I set out to train harder, I’ll get to see\nmore amazing things like that again![VAR 0114(0007)]
11	Yeah. Our mother does like to do things on an...\nextravagant scale.[VAR 0114(0013)]
12	I was really glad that you came, too, Hau.[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	I can get you to the next island at least.\nPoni Island.\c\nI’ll wait for you at the docks.[VAR 0114(0013)]
14	Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s show the world what we can really do![VAR 0114(0006)]
15	Guess I should wish you guys a good trip, huh?\c\nI’m gonna train up myself and my team real good\nbefore I see you again, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nBe ready for the shock of a lifetime![VAR 0114(0007)]

0	Ready to go?[VAR 0114(0013)]
1	All right.[VAR 0114(0013)]
2	Then I’ll wait here.[VAR 0114(0013)]
3	Let’s go, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nNo holding back![VAR 0114(0006)]
290
0	Poni Island...\c\nAlmost no one lives on it, but you’ll find a whole\nlot of nature to explore here.[VAR 0114(0013)]
1	Go. Find the kahuna.[VAR 0114(0013)]
2	The kahuna of Poni Island also protects the\nshrine where Alola’s people worship the\r\nLegendary Pokémon.\c\nMaybe they will know something that might\nhelp you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
3	Gladion...\c\nthank you for this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	But...but when you took Null and left Aether\nParadise two years ago...\r\nyou left me alone with Mother!\r\nShe was so bad after you left!\c\nIf I hadn’t had Wicke with me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	I’m sorry...\c\nI wasn’t there for you when you needed me.\c\nAll I could think about back then was finding a\nway to save Null...\c\nThat was the battle I was fighting.\c\nBut now you’ve found your own battle to fight.\nI know you can handle it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
6	[VAR 0100(0000)].\nI’m OK. You don’t have to worry.\r\nI know what I have to do now.[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	And...\c\nI don’t know. Maybe it sounds strange, but...\c\nI’m kind of excited.[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	Poni Island, here we come! Bzzt-zzt!\c\nWonder what kinds of new Pokémon we’ll get to\nrub elbows with here, eh, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\r\nIf only I had elbows! Bzzzzzzt![VAR 0114(0035)]

1	Oh my goodness![VAR 0114(0006)]
2	I-I’m sorry. Who are you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Me? I’m the chief of the seafolk.\nIt’s my job to keep everybody together.
4	The...seafolk?[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	Yes, ma’am!\c\nWhat’d you think all these boats ’round\nyou are here for?
6	We seafolk have spent years navigating the\nseas and searching out new wonders.\c\nWhen we find rare things, we bring ’em here\nto Alola to trade.
7	The ports on the other islands are busier\nthese days, but we still always seem to end\r\nup back here on Poni, eh?
8	What did you all come here for?\nYou collecting Berries, like us? 
9	We’re here to visit the kahuna.[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	The kahuna? Hmm.\c\nMaybe you should go to little Hapu’s place?\c\nHer house is the only one still standing on Poni,\nafter all. Where else would you go, eh?
11	You can recognize little Hapu’s house at a\nglance...thanks to that huge Mudsdale of hers.
12	Oh! So Hapu lives here on Poni Island?\c\nThank you very much, Chief![VAR 0114(0006)]
13	Let’s go, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nIt will be good to see Hapu and Mudsdale again![VAR 0114(0006)]
14	Lipper!
292
0	I’ll do my best to keep up, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	I’ll be fine! I’ve got Max Repels with me.\c\nAnd I’ve got you, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Poni Island...\nIt’s a completely different kind of island, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0006)]
293
0	Ni-hiiii!
1	It’s good to see you again, too, Mudsdale!\nYou look to be in fine form.[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Wow...\nPokémon Trainers really do amaze me.\c\nIt seems like a hard path to walk, and even so,\nyou don’t let yourself be held back by the fear\r\nof seeing your Pokémon friends get hurt...\c\nYou just keep striving forward together...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Oh! Been a while, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nAnd you brought Lillie along, too?[VAR 0114(000B)]
4	Yes. It’s good to see you, Hapu![VAR 0114(0006)]
5	You look different...like you’re ready to go all out\nin something now.[VAR 0114(000B)]
6	Thank you, Hapu.\nI’ve finally discovered what I need to do.\r\nSo this is my Z-Powered form![VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Ho! Then you do your best, Lillie.[VAR 0114(000B)]
8	No one could call you lily-livered![VAR 0114(000B)]
9	Um, so, Hapu...do you know where we can find\nthe kahuna?[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	The kahuna?\c\nHrmm.\nDon’t have one here on Poni.[VAR 0114(000B)]
11	What?![VAR 0114(0006)]
12	Now what do we do, [VAR 0100(0000)]...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	Hmph...\nWell, I suppose the time might be right now...\c\nI already finished up my battle against that odd\nlittle thing that appeared out of the sky...[VAR 0114(000B)]
14	All right. Let us all proceed to the ruins.\nYou stick with me, you two.[VAR 0114(000B)]
15	Ni-hiiii!
294
0	[VAR 0100(0000)]...\nwe just have to keep going, right!\c\nBut then again...you are a Trainer, aren’t you?\nI suppose you always keep moving forward![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Wait there.[VAR 0114(0030)]
2	Eek![VAR 0114(0006)]
3	I-I’m sorry. I don’t think we’ve been introduced...[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Ho ho ho!\nI’m Hapu’s old gran.\c\nAre you two friends with my girl?
5	Yes, we are
6	How did you guess?
7	Ho ho ho!\nSo she has friends now!
8	Ho ho ho!\nYou’d tease an old woman, eh?
9	Traveling around the islands...\nmaking new friends...\r\nYou kids are luckier than you know.
10	If you want to head for the Poni Island ruins,\nhow about a bit of help from this old gran?\r\nHere. Hand over your Ride Pager a moment.
11	Machamp was registered to your Ride Pager!
12	[~ 12]
13	You’ll need to move some big obstacles to make\nit down the path that you two hope to travel.
14	I wish you both a bright future.
15	My Hapu was heading for the Ruins of Hope,\nwasn’t she? Go after her.\c\nFirst, you’ll come to Poni Breaker Coast.\nYou’ll know it by the soil—it’s black as pitch.\r\nGo through there, and you’ll find the ruins.
16	Thank you very much, ma’am!\nYou have been a great help![VAR 0114(0006)]
17	The Ruins of Hope...\c\nthat is where the guardian of Poni Island will be.\nThat is where Tapu Fini lives.\c\nLet’s go![VAR 0114(0006)]
295
0	The Ruins of Hope...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	What is this place...?\nThe air feels so oppressive...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	But...but if we go in there...\c\nmaybe Nebby will return to normal![VAR 0114(0006)]
3	The people believe that the guardian deity of\nthese ruins, Tapu Fini, can wash away any\r\nimpurities with its mystic water...[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	That sounds promising
5	You think that’ll work?
6	That’s right it does, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI’m going to give it my all so that we can return\nNebby back to normal![VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Oh, honestly, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI’m going to make sure that Nebby gets right\nback to normal, just to show you![VAR 0114(0006)]
8	So just you wait, Nebby!\c\nThis time I’m going to be the one who saves you![VAR 0114(0006)]
9	Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s go![VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Ni-hiiii!
296
0	If we’re going to break a path, we’ll need to\nmove these huge rocks![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	That’s what Hapu’s grandmother said, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	...Unghhh![VAR 0114(0006)]
3	I don’t think I can do this...\nI-it’s heavier than words can even express...[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	We’ll have to borrow Machamp’s formidable\nstrength for this task.\c\nI read about it once in a book.\nIf I remember right, it said...\c\n“When getting a ride from a powerful Machamp,\nTrainers can activate Machamp’s [VAR FF00(0001)]Shove[VAR FF00(0000)] by\r\nstanding before a rock and pressing !”\c\nAnd if we find ourselves getting frustrated,\nwe should probably remember to step outside\r\nagain for a bit of perspective.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	When Hapu spoke of an “odd little thing” from\nthe sky...do you think she meant a beast?\c\nWhat do you think Hapu brought us here for?\c\nSo many of the things that Trainers do are\nstill a mystery to me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
297
0	I’ve read about them, you know...\c\nAlola’s sacred ruins...and the guardian deities\nworshipped within them.\c\nThey go wherever they want, so it’s not easy to\nmeet them...according to the books I’ve read.\c\nBut if they are summoned here at the ruins,\nthey do sometimes appear.[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	The books say that they are, well, capricious.\c\nEncounters with them do not always end as\nyou hope they will.\c\nMaybe that explains why...\c\neven coming here to these ruins hasn’t evoked\nany response from Nebby...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Oh! There’s Hapu![VAR 0114(0006)]
298
0	I give my thanks...
1	for your great blessing.
2	As kahuna, I will do my best for the people...
3	and the Pokémon of Alola.
299
0	Oh! So you two were watching?[VAR 0114(000B)]
1	The kahunas are chosen by the Pokémon we\nworship here in Alola—our sacred guardians.\c\nThey are chosen from among the people living\non the island each guardian watches over.\c\nLillie told me that you’re pretty new to our parts,\neh, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\r\nYou came to Alola from far off?\c\nYou must really be something then.\c\nI heard how you were given a sparkling stone\nby the tapu, even as a stranger to our shores.[VAR 0114(000B)]
2	My grandfather...\c\nMy grandfather was also chosen for this honor.\nThe honor of being our island’s kahuna.\c\nBut he died suddenly some years back,\nand we were left without a kahuna on Poni.[VAR 0114(000B)]
3	I tried to follow in his footsteps, but I was not\nchosen by the tapu back then.\c\nSo I set out on my own sort of island challenge,\ntraveling Alola and trying to grow stronger.[VAR 0114(000B)]
4	Lillie.\c\nThe kahuna you wished to meet is right here.[VAR 0114(000B)]
5	O-oh! Of course!\c\nThen please, Kahuna Hapu!\nTell me about the Legendary Pokémon![VAR 0114(0006)]
6	So you want to know about Solgaleo, who we\npay tribute to at the Altar of the Sunne?[VAR 0114(000B)]
7	So you want to know about Lunala, who we\npay tribute to at the Altar of the Moone?[VAR 0114(000B)]
8	My mother disappeared into the beast’s world...\c\nI know that she was a terrible person, but she\nis still my mother.\r\nI need to see her again, to tell her something.[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	That’s why I want to ask the Legendary\nPokémon for its help...\c\nThe Legendary Pokémon is the only one\nwho can go back and forth between worlds![VAR 0114(0006)]
10	The world of the beasts, eh...\c\nIs that what that thing was that came to\nPoni Island? A beast?\c\nTapu Fini and I tried to fight it, but it nearly\ndid us both in. We did not stand a chance.[VAR 0114(000B)]
11	All right.\nI will tell you what I know.[VAR 0114(000B)]
12	Oh, thank you, Hapu![VAR 0114(0006)]
13	But what I know is not much.\c\nJust that there is a ceremony held for the\nLegendary Pokémon at the altar.\c\nA ceremony that uses two particular flutes to\nsomehow give the Legendary Pokémon power.[VAR 0114(000B)]
14	This is the Moon Flute.\nIt seems that my mother had it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
15	This is the Sun Flute.\nIt seems that my mother had it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
16	Ho! That looks to be the flute that used to\nreside at the lake on Ula’ula.[VAR 0114(000B)]
17	The other is said to be held on Exeggutor Island.\c\nI do not know why there of all places, but it has\nbeen passed down that that’s where it belongs.[VAR 0114(000B)]
18	Exeggutor Island...\nI think I’ve read about it before.\c\nIt’s an uninhabited island off the coast of Poni,\nisn’t that right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
19	Yes. And no reason to dally here.\nLet us go and speak with the seafolk’s chief!\c\nLillie, you take Mudsdale.\nWe proceed to Seafolk Village![VAR 0114(000B)]
300
0	Thank you, Hapu!\nAnd thank you, Mudsdale![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	That’s what friends do.[VAR 0114(000B)]
2	F-friends...?\c\nAn amazing Trainer like Hapu considers me...\na friend?[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Thank you, Hapu!\nI will not give up, no matter what![VAR 0114(0006)]
4	To journey to Exeggutor Island, you\nshould speak with the chief of the sea folk.\r\nI shall be wishing for your safety![VAR 0114(000B)]
5	Mu-hiiiiiin!
301
0	Did you find her?
1	Yes!\nAnd Hapu was made the new kahuna![VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Oh-ho! Now that’s a joy to my ears.\nHer old grandfather must be smiling down on us.
3	Yes.\nHapu will do her best for her late grandfather...\c\nas I must do my best for my mother’s sake.\nAnd for Nebby, as well.\c\nA-and so!\nThere’s a place that we need to go.[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Exeggutor Island
5	To find the flute
6	Exeggutor Island...?\nOh, you mean where the flute is!
7	To find the flute?\nOh, you must want Exeggutor Island!
8	Well, you two did meet the kahuna already...\c\nand Poni’s captain ain’t around anyway, so\nI guess there’s no point waiting on any trials...
9	All right! The S.S. Magikarp will have you there,\nand you’ll think you’re sailing in a dream!

0	Hah... Here we are at Exeggutor Island!\c\nI heard that this place used to be a trial site,\nthough that was a long time ago now.
1	You go on. Good luck to you both!
2	You want to go back to Poni Island?
3	Fair enough. Let’s be going.
4	I’ll wait around for you then.
5	Let’s go find that flute! Right?\c\nTrainers really can go anywhere as long as\nthey have their Pokémon, can’t they?\r\nI think I’m beginning to understand the appeal.[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	You want to head back to Exeggutor Island?
303
0	I feel like Trainers can open up the door to\nany future as long as they have their Pokémon.\c\nThat’s what it looks like to me when I see you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. And Hapu and Hau, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Ahhh!\nWhat is that, [VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Phew...\nThat was an Exeggutor, wasn’t it?\c\nI think that the good weather in Alola has let it\ngrow a bit more vigorously than I’d prefer![VAR 0114(0006)]
304
0	Oh! It’s started to rain...[VAR 0114(0006)]
305
0	Rain in Alola, huh...\c\nMy skirt got a bit wet...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Looking out at the rain like this...\nreminds me of this one time when I was little.[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	I’d seen it in a movie...\c\nthis man singing and dancing in the rain.\c\nIt captivated me so much that I had to try it\nfor myself.\c\nMy mother spotted me out in the rain, and she\nwas so shocked that she ran right out after me\r\nwithout even bothering to get an umbrella...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	And then...she smiled...\nand she danced with me in the rain.\c\nOf course we both ended up catching cold.\c\nShe let me sleep in her big bed with her.\nI was so happy that I kept waking her again\r\nand again, just to be sure it wasn’t a dream...[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	But...\c\nthen she changed.\c\nAnd all she would think about was the\nUltra Beasts.\c\nAnd Null and Nebby...\c\nThey both ended up suffering so much...\nand I couldn’t do anything...[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	But you know what, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nWhenever I feel like there’s nothing I can do,\nyou seem to show up and...you do something.\c\nEvery time, you’ve shown me that it’s possible...\nto do something.[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Even the first time we met...\c\nNebby was being attacked, and all I could do\nwas look on in horror...[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	And at Aether Paradise...\c\nall I could do was wait for you and the\nothers to save me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	Whenever I’m in any sort of trouble, you’re\nalways there...[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	I...[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Um...\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nWhat are you going to do...once you finish your\nisland challenge?[VAR 0114(0006)]
11	Fill my Pokédex
12	Get stronger
13	I don’t know
14	It must be nice, knowing what you want to do.\nI really admire that.[VAR 0114(0006)]
15	Oh, thank goodness...\c\nIt’s such a relief to know that even someone\nlike you feels unsure at times, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
16	I think...I’d like to become a Trainer, too.\nAnd travel together with you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
17	I want to become a Trainer, and learn all the\nthings you know, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
18	... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0006)]
19	Ah![VAR 0114(0006)]
20	Maybe there really are good omens sometimes,\nwouldn’t you say?[VAR 0114(0006)]

0	[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	A flute is placed on a very old pedestal...
2	Will you take the flute?
3	You obtained the Sun Flute!
4	You obtained the Moon Flute!
5	Now we have both the Sun Flute and the\nMoon Flute![VAR 0114(0006)]
6	I don’t know if it will really summon the\nLegendary Pokémon, but we can at least try!\c\nIf nothing else, we’ll have sounded the flutes in\noffering like people used to do.\c\nSo thank you for coming this far with me,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Let’s go meet the chief of the seafolk and\nget back to Poni Island![VAR 0114(0006)]
307
0	Look at you, trial-goer!\nYou going to the altar to play the flutes?\c\nThe altar lies all the way through the Vast Poni\nCanyon. It’s a long road there.\r\nThat path is like nature’s own trial.\c\nGood luck to you, friends.\c\nAnd why don’t you stop by and tell Hapu that\nyou’re off before you go!

3	We can make you talk, even if we have to cut\nyou to the bone![VAR 0114(0032)]
4	OK, so you cut me to the bone! Ouch![VAR 0114(0032)]
5	Doesn’t matter! We’ll come after you with all our\nPokémon at once then, li’l homeslice!\c\nWe’ll give 200 percent to save our boy Guzma![VAR 0114(0031)]
6	I’m not giving up, even though you beat me!\nI’m part of Team Skull! We’re thick as anything![VAR 0114(0031)]
7	That’s enough.\nNo one wants to see a sore loser.[VAR 0114(0018)]
8	Hmmph. You, girlie...\c\nLillie, right?[VAR 0114(0018)]
9	You really ready to do this finally?[VAR 0114(0018)]
10	To be honest, I’ve treated you really badly.\c\nEven if I was just doing the work the president\ntold me to do, I shouldn’t have done all that.\c\nEven if I apologize now, I know it’s probably too\nlate for you to forgive me, though.[VAR 0114(0018)]
11	See, Guzma...\c\nhe really likes the president.\c\nShe’s the only adult who ever seemed to see\nhow strong he was.[VAR 0114(0018)]
12	The president...\c\nMy mother is—\nShe’s selfish.\c\nShe lavishes her love only on those she deems\nworthy, not caring whether it is wanted or not.[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	But I will save her.\nI still have something I need to tell her.\c\nAnd I think I can save Guzma as well.[VAR 0114(0006)]
14	You know...deep down, you’re kind of like\nthe president.\c\nYou’ve gone in a different direction, but I can tell\nyou have the same strength in your convictions.[VAR 0114(0018)]
15	Bring Guzma back, if you can.\nI know you’ve got no reason to help...\c\nbut no one can make up for what they’ve done\nif they’re gone.[VAR 0114(0018)]
16	And you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nLooks like you were special after all.\c\nYou didn’t just stand up to Team Skull.\nYou even took on the darkness inside Aether.\c\nLooks like you’re the real deal.\nThe realest Pokémon Trainer I’ve seen around.[VAR 0114(0018)]
17	Take good care of our little princess here.\c\nThis is my way of saying sorry, OK?\nTake it. It’s Poisonium Z.[VAR 0114(0018)]
18	Oh yeah...\c\nyou got your first stone directly from Tapu\nKoko, didn’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nYou’d better take care of it. \nThat’s one special Z-Ring you’ve got there.[VAR 0114(0018)]
19	A Trainer is only a Trainer because of the\nPokémon with them.\c\nIf you ever forget that, you’ll bring the wrath\nof the tapu down upon yourself.\c\nYou should be fine, though.[VAR 0114(0018)]
20	I’m out of here.[VAR 0114(0018)]
21	I suppose even Team Skull is not all bad...\c\nThanks for helping me again, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nAnd here, let me thank your team, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
22	All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s go to the altar!\c\nThe Vast Poni Canyon lies ahead of us![VAR 0114(0006)]
309
0	Did everything go well?[VAR 0114(000B)]
1	Yes, it did![VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Though [VAR 0100(0000)] had to help me out of\nall sorts of trouble, like usual.[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Nothing wrong with that.\c\nPeople cannot survive all on their own.\nThey have got to help one another out.\c\nSame for Pokémon, too.\c\nThat is what my grandfather used to say.[VAR 0114(000B)]
4	Ni-hiii!
5	I would like to see this battling skill of yours,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], that makes Lillie smile so.[VAR 0114(000B)]
6	Just so! It is my grand trial!\c\nI may be young, but that does not mean that I\nwill be outdone by any of those other kahunas!\c\nI am certain that my bonds with Mudsdale\nand the rest of my team are the\r\nclosest you will find anywhere in Alola![VAR 0114(000B)]
7	Do you want to try to take me and my Pokémon\non at our full strength?[VAR 0114(000B)]
8	Only if you’ll take on mine
9	I need to prepare first
10	Then I will wait.[VAR 0114(000B)]
11	I am Kahuna Hapu!\c\nAnd I have made the sparkling stone that the\ntapu entrusted me with into a Z-Ring of my own![VAR 0114(000B)]
12	Having a Z-Ring like we do, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nmeans that we battle with the tapu beside us.[VAR 0114(000B)]
13	This is the first grand trial of Kahuna Hapu!\c\nI will battle you with everything that I have got![VAR 0114(000B)]
14	Ahaha! Now, don’t be hasty, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLook at the state of your Pokémon.\c\nWe have got to have them in peak condition for\nthis to be a fair fight.[VAR 0114(000B)]
15	Oho...\nYou sure showed me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
16	That was enjoyable.\c\nLooks like I cannot beat you even when I am not\nholding back...\c\nI appreciate this chance, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nIt has really taught me a few things.[VAR 0114(000B)]
17	Take your Ground-type Z-Crystal then...\nThis Groundium Z is yours![VAR 0114(000B)]
18	I will teach you the pose, too, so eyes up here![VAR 0114(000B)]
19	Hyah![VAR 0114(000B)]
20	Phew...\c\nWell, I must applaud you, Lillie. You sure found\na prodigious Trainer to befriend.[VAR 0114(000B)]
21	Then go on with you two!\nHead straight through here and find the altar![VAR 0114(000B)]
22	The path to the shrine is through the canyon.\c\nYou will find other Trainers in this place, though.\nThey come for training. It will be a tough road.[VAR 0114(000B)]
23	You will have to pitch in, too, Lillie.\c\nBut if you two end up in any real trouble,\nMudsdale and I will hasten to you.[VAR 0114(000B)]
24	Thank you, Hapu. I’ll do my best![VAR 0114(0006)]
25	Come!\c\nIf you want to proceed to that canyon, you will\nhave to get through me and my grand trial![VAR 0114(000B)]

2	Oh, yes! [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHere, take this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	It’s a Max Revive I found in Aether Paradise.[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	When I—\c\nOnce I am ready, I am going to come after you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. I am going to catch up to you.\c\nAnd when I do, I’m going to become strong\nenough to save my mother and Nebby, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
5	Oh, yes...\nBut let me first make sure that [VAR 0101(0001)]\r\n[VAR 1101(00FD,1D06)]is alland the rest of your team are ready for battle![VAR 0114(0006)]

1	But you know what?\c\nI’ve overcome my fears enough to cross even\na high bridge like this one![VAR 0114(0006)]
2	I am not going to be afraid of heights anymore.\c\nNext time I should even be able to tackle that\nbridge on Mahalo Trail![VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Watch this!\nThis is my trial![VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Oh...[VAR 0114(0006)]

11	But it’s really thanks to you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nYou’re the reason why I’ve come so far!\c\nStill...I think I’ll take a little rest here.\c\nI’m afraid my legs are still shaking![VAR 0114(0006)]
12	[VAR 0101(0001)], do you want a rest, too?[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	Don’t worry. I’ve got you covered!\c\nI have Hyper Potions and Revives and even\nlots of Ethers, too.\c\nThough I’m not sure I brought enough Max\nRepels for a path like this one...[VAR 0114(0006)]
312
0	Hah...\c\nHaaah...\c\nSorry...\nI’m not...very good...at running...[VAR 0114(0006)]

3	When your Pokémon are full of energy, then a\nTrainer can go anywhere in the world...\r\nDoesn’t it seem that way?[VAR 0114(0006)]

1	Nanu said maybe he can’t refuse a tapu\nchoosing him to serve as kahuna...\c\nBut he’d be darned if he had to serve as one of\nthe Elite Four just because some guy asked him!\c\nSo I guess I’ll just have to battle hard enough\nto make up for his not being here![VAR 0114(0011)]
2	Phew!\c\nWell, there goes my hope of beating you to\nsmithereens and becoming Champion myself![VAR 0114(0011)]

5	There are three more members of the Elite Four.\c\nAnd every one of them is a top-class Trainer.[VAR 0114(0019)]

4	You really do love your Pokémon with all your\nheart, don’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0011)]
5	Yup! That’s precisely why [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she and h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser Pokémon\nwere able to combine that strength to\r\nemerge victorious![VAR 0114(0009)]

6	Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nIt looks like the party is going to keep on going\nstrong for some time still, wouldn’t you say?\c\nDo you think...maybe...we could sneak out for\na second and visit the Ruins of Conflict?\c\nI heard from Kahuna Hala that the bridge\nhas been fixed.[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Sure!
8	What about the festival?
9	I think Tapu Koko must be waiting...\c\nI’m sure it’s waiting for you to come to it,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nnow that you finished your island challenge.[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Really, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWe should go and tell Tapu Koko properly...\nhow you finished your island challenge![VAR 0114(0006)]
348
0	Now this really takes me back...\c\nBack then I could barely think about anything.\nI was so desperate...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	But thinking back on it now...\c\nit really was Solgaleo...\c\nI mean it was Nebby who brought the two of us\ntogether, wasn’t it, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	But thinking back on it now...\c\nit really was Lunala...\c\nI mean it was Nebby who brought the two of us\ntogether, wasn’t it, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Come on! Let’s go![VAR 0114(0006)]
349
0	The Ruins of Conflict...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	I still wonder why it is that Tapu Koko helped\nus that day...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Was it because of some connection to Solgaleo...\nthe Legendary Pokémon of the Alola region?[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Was it because of some connection to Lunala...\nthe Legendary Pokémon of the Alola region?[VAR 0114(0006)]
350
0	This reminds me of when Hapu became the\nkahuna of Poni Island...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	My heart is pounding in my chest...\nIs it because of the sacred guardian?\r\nIs Tapu Koko here with us?[VAR 0114(0006)]
351
0	Great Tapu Koko...\c\nit was because of your help that Cosmog lived\nand was able to become Solgaleo.\c\nPlease allow me to thank you on its behalf.\nThank you so very, very much![VAR 0114(0006)]

2	It’s your turn next, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	I want to see you show your appreciation in the\nway that only Alola’s Champion could!\c\nI know you can do this, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI’ll make sure your team is ready, too.[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	[VAR 0100(0000)]! Honestly!\c\nIt’s time you showed Tapu Koko your gratitude.\nDo it through one of the battles that it so loves.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	You reached out and touched the statue...
6	You seem to hear a voice ringing in your head...\nas though it’s coming from your Z-Ring...?
7	GOOD...SOLGALEO...
8	GOOD...LUNALA...
9	IT IS TIME...
10	Tapu ko-ko-ko-kooo!!!
11	Tapu Koko disappeared...
12	A Z-Crystal clattered to the floor at your feet...
13	There is no reaction from the statue...
14	Tapu Koko... It may have lost that battle to you,\nbut I don’t think it was sad about that.\c\nI’m sure that the two of you will meet in battle\nagain someday![VAR 0114(0006)]
15	Tapu Koko...\c\nI know it will aspire to ever greater heights at\nyour side from now on, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
16	So you’ll challenge Tapu Koko another day...\c\nI suppose Trainers must know how to judge the\nstrength of their opponents and must also\r\nunderstand their own limits.[VAR 0114(0006)]
17	The great Tapu Koko...\nIt really is fantastically strong, isn’t it!\r\nNo wonder it is the guardian of all Akala![VAR 0114(0006)]
18	But I’m so glad we could come here.\nIt had been weighing on my heart...[VAR 0114(0006)]
19	Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nWe should get back to the village.\c\nIf we don’t return soon, everyone will realize\nthat we slipped away from the festival![VAR 0114(0006)]
352
0	Everyone looks like they are having so much fun\nthat I don’t think they even noticed we left...\c\nOh!\nAnd the Battle Royals are about to begin![VAR 0114(0006)]

2	I hope that you’ll always stay just the way\nyou are now, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nLook how your joy has brought so much light\nto everyone here...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	I think even my mother would have smiled and\nlaughed to see this...if she could have come...[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	I think...my mother is getting a bit better.\nShe even tried to come tonight...[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	I’ve been trying to help her understand what\nshe did wrong. Gently, of course.\r\nBut she needed someone to scold her.[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	But in the process I think I’ve discovered what\nI have to do next.\r\nWhat it is that I can do.[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	[VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI...I am going to—[VAR 0114(0006)]

13	It’s pretty far
14	Yes, I’d say it’s pretty close.\nClose enough to visit whenever you want to![VAR 0114(0004)]
15	Well...\nit’s true that it’s not the next island or anything.\c\nBut it’s still close enough to visit whenever you\nwant to![VAR 0114(0004)]
16	All right! Then it’s decided!\c\nI’m gonna get stronger and stronger, and then\nI’m gonna travel the world with my Pokémon!\c\nI’m gonna go find Lillie!\nAnd my dad, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
17	Your father?[VAR 0114(0004)]
18	Oh, yeah, him. Heh...\c\nHe’s a strong Trainer—real strong, I think.\nBut I guess he really hated being the son of\r\na kahuna and everything, yeah?\r\nSo he works far away from Alola these days.[VAR 0114(0007)]

4	Phew! It is difficult, triumphing over all the\nElite Four in a row.\c\nHowever, defeating the Champion will\nsurely be even more challenging.[VAR 0114(000B)]
5	We do our utmost as kahunas, always striving\nonward to make a tale worthy of our history.\c\nLooks like you are going to make a fine tale for\nyourself, Champion![VAR 0114(000B)]
6	If I am serious about my role as a kahuna, then\ntaking on the Champion seems fitting![VAR 0114(000B)]

21	You’re great, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou understand Pokémon so well and know so\nmuch about Pokémon battles.\c\nI see that thinking up this and that to try to\ndefeat the Champion is the highest form of fun![VAR 0114(0010)]
22	Playing games with Big Mo...\c\nMaintaining Festival Plaza...\c\nChecking the anime I’ve recorded...\c\nThey’re all fun but not the same as a battle with\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI worked out a plan with Ilima against you, \n[VAR 0100(0000)], to try to win.[VAR 0114(0010)]
23	You’re way too strong, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\n“Ping Totem Pokémon 2.0” is \nrunning smoothly, so next I’m thinking that\c\nI should put together Sophocles’s\nenhanced program.[VAR 0114(0010)]
24	I came to check on what Kukui has built, and...\nthe Pokémon League is fantastic!\c\nIt’s a place that conveys the awesomeness of\nAlola to the world.\c\nAnd in that case, I guess that what’s important\nis what kind of Trainer the Champion is.[VAR 0114(001C)]
25	Just as I’d expect from an acquaintance\nof Kukui’s!\c\nI too am proud that you are the strongest\nPokémon Trainer in Alola!\c\nI’ll try to come hang out again.\c\nPokémon battles with you are more fun than\nany game![VAR 0114(001C)]
26	I gave the captain position to my cousin\nSophocles, but I’m confident in my ability.\c\nMy strength is like that of a supernova![VAR 0114(001C)]
27	Just as I’d expect from the Champion!\c\nIn every situation, you pick the best moves\nand items.\c\nSo I too have to rack my brain in the battle...\nAt some point I want to have a battle with\r\nSophocles and me as a duo versus you and\r\nKukui for all the marbles. Or I guess a\r\nBattle Royal?[VAR 0114(001C)]
28	I don’t really wanna be the Champion of the\nPokémon League I made myself, but there’s\r\nnothing wrong with wanting to take on the\r\nbiggest and baddest Trainer there is, right?\c\nAfter all, I do love my research![VAR 0114(0005)]
29	Whoa! Well, I always knew it would be a\ncrushing defeat.\c\nI’m still glad I got to battle you, Champ. And I’m\nas thankful as I could be that I met you and\r\nyour Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
30	All right, [VAR 0100(0000)], I’m coming at you \nwith all my might. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]

32	Those old dudes Molayne and Nanu somehow\ntalked me into doing this.\c\nI’m starting from scratch as a Pokémon Trainer\nand doing it right this time.\c\nI’ve got a Z-Ring and everything, so I might\nactually be able to live up to their expectations.[VAR 0114(0018)]
33	Even when I give it my all, I’m nothing compared\nto you!\c\nMaybe my Pokémon and I need to go through\nmore together to deepen our friendship.\c\nI’m out of here, Champ.[VAR 0114(0018)]
34	My team and I are battling for all the Pokémon\nwe took out on our way here![VAR 0114(0018)]
35	I failed again...like I always do. I promised\nmyself I wouldn’t! I told myself I would never\r\nfail again!\c\nIt’s all right to feel a little jealous, right?\nHow else am I supposed to get stronger?\c\nMy team and I really did take out so many\nPokémon to make it here![VAR 0114(0018)]
36	Hey, Champion!\nYou’ve gotta recommend a move for me!
37	I trained as much as I could on Route 1...\c\nI went through the whole island challenge to\nget here...\c\nand still!\nMan, the Champion really is something!
38	Champion! I’m gonna serve you up a brutal\nhelping of my Pokémon’s best moves!

5	OK! Come see me again if you change\nyour mind.
6	Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be\nknown as [VAR 0102(0000)]!\c\nIt looks no different from before, but we both\nknow this name is vastly superior!\r\nHow fortunate for you!
7	Hmmm. [VAR 0102(0000)]!\nThat is a truly impeccable nickname!\r\nI can’t say anything bad about it!\c\nTake good care of [VAR 0102(0000)]!
8	Now, now...\nThat is merely an Egg!
9	Or do you want to quit giving the Pokémon a\nnickname and change back to the name that\r\nthe Pokémon had when you two met?

3	Just remember me when there’s something you\nwant to forget!

5	What’s this, friend?\nEggs don’t know any moves before they hatch.

179	Welcome!\nYou’ve come to Poké Pelago!\c\nThese uninhabited islands exist solely for the\ndelight of Pokémon.\c\nBut I suppose I should introduce myself, eh?\nHa ha, how rude of me!\c\nYou can call me Mohn!\nI’m in charge of keeping Poké Pelago running.[VAR 0114(0030)]
180	And you are...[VAR 0100(0000)], right?\c\nOK!\nThen let’s get things started![VAR 0114(002F)]
181	The Pokémon that you’ve deposited in your PC\nBoxes can freely come here to Poké Pelago to\r\nhave a bit of fun whenever they want.\c\nRight now we only have one small isle available\nfor them to play on, but if you’ll help me out,\r\nthat won’t be true for very long!\c\nSo here’s what you need to do first.\nWould you pick up the Poké Beans that have\r\nfallen to the ground around the island?[VAR 0114(002F)]
182	Pokémon love Poké Beans.\nThey’re delicious and nutritious!\c\nAnd they can also sprout into Poké Beanstalks,\nlike that one in the middle of the island.\c\nThe one you just picked up is a Plain Bean.\nThere are also rare Poké Beans called Patterned\r\nBeans and even Rainbow Beans!\c\nI love hands-on learning. Don’t you agree?\nSo why don’t you give that Poké Beanstalk a\r\ngood shake and see what happens?[VAR 0114(002F)]
183	Shake the beanstalk to drop some Poké Beans!\nPick up the Poké Beans to add to your stores!\c\nOK, now you’ve got it!\nSee! Isn’t it better to learn by doing?\c\nYou can collect Poké Beans once a day or so.\c\nIf no new Poké Beans come tumbling down,\nthen wait a day and then try again![VAR 0114(002F)]
184	Put some of the Poké Beans you collect into the\nPoké Bean crate on the island, would you?\c\nThen they’ll be handy for any hungry Pokémon\nwandering around the island to eat anytime![VAR 0114(002F)]
185	Yup! That’s a Poké Bean crate right there!\nYou can drop Poké Beans in there, and the\r\nPokémon will love you for it.\c\nEspecially here on Isle Abeens. Leaving Poké\nBeans in the crate here can even tempt wild\r\nPokémon to come by for a gander and some fun.[VAR 0114(002F)]
186	Oh, yes! One more thing! The rarer kinds of\nPoké Beans will have their effects last longer.\r\nYou might want to remember that fact!\c\nBut as long as you fill the crate up, then you’ll\nprobably be A-OK. Don’t you worry!\c\nAnd if you ever want to talk to me about things,\nno need to feel shy.\r\nJust zip right over to my raft hut![VAR 0114(002F)]
187	Wonderful to see you again!\nI’m delighted to welcome you to my raft hut!\c\nThis has been my own private castle ever since\nthat fateful day when I decided to turn these\r\nuninhabited islands into a resort for Pokémon.\c\nI built this place myself and it’s not too shabby,\nif I dare say so myself.\c\nI have everything I could need here to keep\nPoké Pelago up and running.[VAR 0114(002F)]
188	So, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI’ve got a favor to ask of a promising Trainer\nlike yourself.\c\nPoké Pelago only features one small island at\nthe moment, as you’ve seen.\c\nIf you were to liken it to a Pokémon, it would be\na Lv. 1 babe just hatched from its Egg!\c\nSo I’d like you and your Pokémon to put some\neffort into developing the islands here![VAR 0114(002F)]
189	Developing the isles here basically means\nbreaking ground on new isles or improving the\r\nfacilities on isles you already have started on.\c\nWe’ll borrow the strength of the Pokémon you\nhave in your Boxes to do the work.\c\nOh, and we’ll need some Plain Beans!\nDon’t forget those!\r\nNo one can work well on an empty stomach![VAR 0114(002F)]
190	OK!\nThat’s it from me right now.\c\nBut come see me in my Raft Hut anytime\nthat you want some help developing isles![VAR 0114(002F)]
191	Mohn here!\nI keep things running here at Poké Pelago.[VAR 0114(002F)]

225	Looks like you’ve got more than 30 Pokémon\nin your PC Boxes now!\c\nYou’ll be needing more Poké Beans then.\nI guess I’ve got to work harder, too![VAR 0114(002F)]

This’ll be your first Bean Bottle, won’t it?\c\nYes, a Bean Bottle is just what it sounds like:\na bottle that has Poké Beans in it.\c\nBean Bottles sometimes wash up to onto the\nshore here at these isles.\c\nThey must have been set adrift by someone\nelse out in this wide world, which is connected\r\nall over by the great oceans!\c\nPeople set these bottles adrift hoping that they\nmight bring some happiness to the person\r\nwho finds one!\c\nIt’s a pretty romantic idea, isn’t it?\nAnd that’s A-OK in my book![VAR 0114(002F)]
237	If you bring happiness to someone else, then\nmaybe something good will happen to you, too!\c\nThat’s why it never hurts to do something nice\nlike setting a Bean Bottle adrift in the ocean.\c\nBut you can only send out one Bean Bottle per\nday, I’m afraid.\c\nHappiness that can be bought cheaply might\nend up inviting unhappiness instead![VAR 0114(002F)]
238	Poké Beans can come in special varieties called\nPatterned Beans and Rainbow Beans.\c\nYou can sometimes find these rare Poké Beans\non Isle Abeens, if you’re lucky.\c\nThey are absolutely delicious, so your Pokémon\nwill be delighted if you feed one to them![VAR 0114(002F)]

240	OK!\nSo let’s trade some beans![VAR 0114(002F)]
241	[~ 241]
242	So you’ll help me! Thank you, thank you.\nAnd now that we have that settled...\c\nOK then! There are five isles total that you can\ndevelop here at Poké Pelago!\c\nEach one will require you to have a different\nnumber of Pokémon in your Boxes and\r\nPlain Beans in your coffers![VAR 0114(002F)]
243	Check what it says that you need to develop\neach isle in its summary, OK?\c\nOK then! If that’s all clear, you just tell me\nwhich isle you’d like to develop next![VAR 0114(002F)]
244	Anyway, you don’t need to worry yourself about\nmy diet. This is all you need to know:\c\nI’ll give you three Plain Beans for each\nPatterned Bean you offer me.\r\nAnd seven Plain Beans for each Rainbow Bean!\c\nSo what do you say to a little trade?[VAR 0114(002F)]
245	Looks like there’s no more space to plant any\nBerries in that field!\c\nWhy don’t you harvest some of your ripe Berries\nand free up a little space to plant in?[VAR 0114(002F)]
246	We’ve done it! It’s the perfect Poké Pelago\nI’ve always dreamed of!

249	You’ve come at just the right time!\nThis Egg looks ready to hatch at any moment![VAR 0114(002F)]

251	The Bean Bottle was sent adrift out to sea![VAR 0114(002F)]
252	Do you want to leave Poké Pelago?[VAR 0114(002F)]

0	Hello there! You must be one of Ilima’s friends?
1	Come on in! Any friend to my son is a friend\nto me!
2	Just one thing, though.\c\nI’d like to hear what you think of my boy.\nIs he doing a good job as a captain?
3	He’s a good captain
4	I’m not really sure
5	Sorry. I probably shouldn’t have asked you\nsomething like that out of the blue...\c\nOur Ilima has just always been obsessed with\nPokémon battling, ever since he was a boy.\c\nHe’s like a different person when he\nbattles—you can see it in his eyes!\c\nI’ve always been a little worried about\nwhether he would do all right as a captain.
6	Sorry to hold you up.\nIf you’re looking for Ilima, he’s in his room.
7	Any friend of my son’s is welcome here.\nStay as long as you’d like.
8	Thank you for coming, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
9	And you’ve arrived with such exquisite timing!\c\nI’ve been conducting research on battle planning\nfor quite some time, and at last my simulation\r\nis complete![VAR 0114(000C)]
10	Would you be so kind as to test it with\nme, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
11	Not now
12	Sure
13	What a shame.\c\nPlease do let me know when you are available.[VAR 0114(000C)]
14	You have my gratitude.\c\nVery well then. To the Trainers’ School![VAR 0114(000C)]
15	Before we begin, allow me to explain...\c\nIt’s not battle results that interest me.\nRather, it’s the carefully-thought-out strategies\r\nor novel tactics employed by Trainers.\c\nHow those plans affect one’s opponent and\ninfluence the outcome of battles—that is where\r\nmy interest lies![VAR 0114(000C)]
16	Now give me everything you’ve\ngot, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
17	Wonderful! What a truly wonderful battle!\c\nI’ll be feeling the aftershocks from that battle\nfor a long time to come. That was the best I\r\ncould’ve hoped for![VAR 0114(000C)]
18	The way that Ilima looked in that battle seems\nto linger in your mind...
19	Thank you.\c\nAllow me to treat you to some tea and snacks\nback in my room.[VAR 0114(000C)]
20	Will you be on your way then?\c\nAllow me to offer you this as payment for\nyour assistance.[VAR 0114(000C)]
21	When a Pokémon holds an Everstone, it will\nnot evolve.\c\nIt has other effects as well, but let’s set those\naside for now.\c\nMay our friendship last as long as an Everstone![VAR 0114(000C)]
22	I think I’ll begin analyzing our battle data.\c\nThere are so many amazing discoveries yet to\nbe made! Someday I hope to share them\r\nwith everyone![VAR 0114(000C)]

0	Who are you, [VAR 1100(00FF,0406)]misterlady?\nAre you one of Sissy’s friends?
1	It’s a stranger!\nWho are you? Who are you?
2	Wow!\nAn island challenge amulet!
3	Sissy isn’t here!\nBut I think she’s coming home, soon.
4	Play with us till Sissy comes home!
5	OK
6	What?
7	Then I wanna have a battle!\nLet’s do a moldy battle!
8	Meanie! Big, stinky meanie!\nCome on, play with us!
9	It’s not a moldy battle!\nIt’s a Multi Battle! We’ll have a Multi Battle!
10	Yeah, that. So what do you say?\nYou ready, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady?
11	You’re on!
12	Not yet
13	Come on!\nHurry up and get ready already!
14	Come on!\nYou can’t fight without enough Pokémon!
15	Wowzers!\nYou are sure strong, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady!
16	You might even be stronger than Sissy!
17	I’m home, girls.[VAR 0114(000D)]
18	Sissy!
19	Welcome home!
20	Oh! [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nYou came to visit with us?[VAR 0114(000D)]
21	M[VAR 1100(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady was playing with us!
22	[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe is really strong. Did you know that?
23	Well, thank you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nFor entertaining my little sisters so kindly.[VAR 0114(000D)]
24	Hey, Sissy! Sissy!
25	Who’s probably stronger? You or this Trainer?\nLike, if you were REALLY trying?
26	Yeah, who?
27	Who’s stronger? Are you stronger?
28	Well... I don’t rightly know.\n[VAR 0100(0000)] is definitely strong h[VAR 1100(0000,0202)]imerself.[VAR 0114(000D)]
29	But we wanna know who’s stronger!
30	Battle h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer!
31	It looks like I’ve got little choice...\c\nOnce the girls have their minds set, they don’t\nbudge, no matter how hard you try.[VAR 0114(000D)]
32	Come on! Do it!
33	Battle! Battle!
34	If you don’t mind, [VAR 0100(0000)], could I ask\nyou for a battle?\c\nThe truth is that I’ve also been wanting to see\nhow we might compare in skill![VAR 0114(000D)]
35	Sure!
36	Umm...
37	I know these girls would love to see us battle,\nso please come back anytime to take me on.\c\nAnd perhaps I should warn you...\nI am quite strong![VAR 0114(000D)]
38	All right!
39	We knew you would do it!
40	Why don’t we go out front, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nI would have some advantage battling inside\nthe house, since I’m so familiar with the layout.[VAR 0114(000D)]
41	Go on! Beat h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer, Sissy!
42	Show h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer what you’ve got!
43	Shall we?[VAR 0114(000D)]
44	I have a responsibility to set a good example\nfor my younger sisters, of course.\c\nBut even more important than that...I have my\npride as a captain!\c\nI will show you what a serious Lana can do![VAR 0114(000D)]
45	I look forward to enjoying a no-holds-barred\nbattle again you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]
46	Phew...[VAR 0114(000D)]
47	No way! She lost!\nSissy actually lost!
48	That’s amazing!\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady is amazing!
49	[VAR 0100(0000)], that was fantastic!\nYou and your Pokémon were perfectly in sync!\c\nIt seems I was premature in thinking that my full\npower would be enough to defeat you.[VAR 0114(000D)]
50	The way that Lana looked in that battle seems\nto linger in your mind...
51	How boring! I can’t believe Sissy lost!\nPoo. I’m going home.
52	Me, too!\nGimme a piggyback ride!
53	Fine, fine...\nLet’s all be getting back home.\c\nBut I will not be carrying you!\nYou can walk on your own two feet.\r\nWhat else do you think you have feet for?[VAR 0114(000D)]
54	Thank you again for playing with my sisters.\c\n...Here. Please have this and use it if you think\nit might be helpful.[VAR 0114(000D)]
55	My father is expecting me to help on the boat,\nso I should be going soon.\c\nBut you feel free to stay as long as you want,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. My home is yours.[VAR 0114(000D)]
56	Hey, strong M[VAR 1100(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady!
57	Hiya, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady!
378
0	Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! What’s up?[VAR 0114(000E)]
1	I came to play with you!
2	I’m here for a battle!
3	All right, let’s do it!\c\nOf course if two Trainers are going to play, it’s\ngotta be a Pokémon battle, right?\c\nYup, it’s decided! I guess we should head to\nLush Jungle.\c\nLet’s make this like a little treasure hunt. Come\nfind me where the Wimpod is! Don’t be late![VAR 0114(000E)]
4	Mallow! Can you give me a hand?
5	Huh? Where’s Mallow?
6	In the jungle
7	She’s not here
8	At this hour? That’s not like her...\c\nbut now I’m in a jam. I was going to ask her to\ngo do some shopping for me.
9	If you see her, can you tell her something\nfor me?\c\nTell her to bring my Wimpod with her when\nshe comes home.
10	Oh, you made it![VAR 0114(000E)]
11	Wimpod is in my big brother’s party.[VAR 0114(000E)]
12	Wi-wim!
13	It’s out here gathering ingredients for\nour restaurant![VAR 0114(000E)]
14	Wi-wim-wim!
15	You’ve got all the ingredients you need for a\ndelicious battle, right?[VAR 0114(000E)]
16	Let’s do this!
17	Gimme a minute...
18	Oh really? Well come back and tell me when\nyou’re ready![VAR 0114(000E)]
19	Time for you to see that I can do more than\njust cook![VAR 0114(000E)]
20	That battle was a piece of cake for you, wasn’t\nit? I should’ve known—you did clear my trial,\r\nafter all!\c\nAs your captain, I am very proud of you, though![VAR 0114(000E)]
21	The way that Mallow looked in that battle\nseems to linger in your mind...
22	There’s no doubt in my mind that you’ll go on to\nbe an amazing Trainer!\c\nLike, you could even be a kahuna someday![VAR 0114(000E)]
23	There’s no doubt in my mind that you’ll go on to\nbe an amazing Trainer!\c\nLike, you could even be a kahuna someday![VAR 0114(000E)]
24	Do you ever think about the\nfuture, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000E)]
25	I do
26	Nope
27	Oh, I see. Well, I’ve got my future all planned out!\c\nI mean, we have to move on from being captains\nwhen we turn 20 anyway.\c\nIt may be ordinary, but I’m hoping to take over\nmy family’s restaurant.\c\nI think I could be an even better chef than my\ndad and big brother one day![VAR 0114(000E)]
28	Huh? What’s up?\c\nIs it something about my big brother?[VAR 0114(000E)]
29	He had a favor to ask...
30	He told me to tell you...
31	Sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’ve gotta get back!\c\nCome on, Wimpod. You, too! Big brother’s\nwaiting for us![VAR 0114(000E)]
32	Wi-wi-wi-wim!
33	It’s been fun, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nSee you later! Bye![VAR 0114(000E)]
379
0	Yah! Hoo! Hee! Hyah![VAR 0114(000F)]
1	Huhn?[VAR 0114(000F)]
2	Oh. It’s you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
3	What are you doing?
4	What was that all about?
5	This is my fire dance training.[VAR 0114(000F)]
6	This is my torch staff.\c\nWhen I’m actually performing fire dances, I’ll light\nit on fire.[VAR 0114(000F)]
7	Whenever I have free time, I practice my dance\nas much as I can.\c\nIt takes a lot of repetition to get good at it...just\nlike Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(000F)]
8	Oh, look at the time![VAR 0114(000F)]
9	Sorry, I know you just got here, but I have to go\nto the Thrifty Megamart.\c\nIf you need to talk to me, come meet me there.[VAR 0114(000F)]
10	I see...[VAR 0114(000F)]
11	Kiawe, I’m really terribly sorry about this, but\nI’ve thought long and hard about this decision.\c\nIf it comes down to people who are counting on\nthis job to make a living, and you...
12	It’s all right.\c\nI know how hard you’ve worked to open this\nlocation after the guardian deity destroyed the\r\nprevious one in anger.\c\nI understand, boss.[VAR 0114(000F)]
13	Kiawe...\c\nI’ve given you as much as I can afford. Spend\nyour final paycheck wisely.
14	Thank you very much.[VAR 0114(000F)]
15	I hope your dream of studying dance abroad\ncomes true someday.\c\nI have to keep working hard here to make my\ndreams for the Thrifty Megamart come true.
16	It’s OK, boss. You can head back in now.[VAR 0114(000F)]
17	Thank you. I’ll be seeing you.
18	How could this happen...?[VAR 0114(000F)]
19	Oh, it’s you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
20	If you don’t mind, I’d like to battle\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
21	Of course
22	Just a minute
23	I see... I’ll be waiting for you here, then.[VAR 0114(000F)]
24	I don’t feel like dancing by myself right now...[VAR 0114(000F)]
25	So strong...\c\nI should’ve known. You did clear my trial,\nafter all.\c\nBy the way, did you overhear what we were\njust talking about?[VAR 0114(000F)]
26	What are you talking about?
27	Yeah, kind of...
28	You’re too considerate, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
29	Yes, of course you did...[VAR 0114(000F)]
30	My dream is to become a professional\nfire dancer.\c\nI’ve been saving up forever to go study\ndance abroad.\c\nBut I was just laid off from my part-time job. It\nseems like nothing ever goes right...[VAR 0114(000F)]
31	Sorry.\c\nI didn’t mean to trouble you with my\nproblems, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYou’re so easy to talk to, though. I feel much\nbetter after talking with you.\r\nThank you for being there.\c\nI’ll be going then.\nUntil we meet again, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000F)]
32	The way that Kiawe looked in that battle seems\nto linger in your mind...

6	Would you like to show me how much your\nPokémon have grown since joining your team?
7	Oh? Well, that is too bad...
8	Which Pokémon will you show me, then?
9	Ho! This is a hard one...
10	Hm? It’s rather hard to judge how well you’ve\nraised an Egg, you know.
11	Oh! It looks like this [VAR 0101(0001)] was only...\nLv. [VAR 0202(0002)] when you first met!\r\nAnd now it’s Lv. [VAR 0202(0003)]!
12	That is some amazing growth.\nI can feel your deep love for your Pokémon.
13	That’s some decent growth, all right.\nYou’ve been real decent to it.

15	How do you grow together?\nBy walking the same path with someone else.\c\nLet me give you this as a reward for showing\nme how far you two have come along together.

20	Oh! Your [VAR 0101(0000)]!
21	I guess maybe you’ll show it some affection\nsoon, huh?
22	It’s starting to look like it likes you!
23	You’ve been showing it some affection, huh?\nYou two are looking good!
24	You two look like great friends!\nYou must play with it a whole lot, huh?
25	You’ve got to be some of the most affectionate\nfriends I’ve ever seen! I think I’m jealous!
26	[VAR 0101(0001)] got a Best Friends Ribbon!
27	I hope you’ll stay friends forever and ever!\nAnd ever and ever!
28	You’re the best friends ever, aren’t you!\c\nNo wonder your Pokémon is wearing that\nBest Friends Ribbon!
29	Ribbons...\c\nThey’re like a way to wrap your Pokémon up in\nprecious memories for perpetuity.\c\nI’ve heard that there are a lot of different kinds\nof ribbons in other regions, outside of Alola.

0	Hey, kid!\nYou’re a local, right? From around here?\c\nI’ve got a favor I want to ask someone like you!\nPlease, you’ve gotta help me!
1	All right
2	I’m busy
3	What?! Oh, come on!\nDon’t be so cold! Where’s your Alola spirit?!
4	Oh, thanks, kid!\nThat’s the Alola spirit! You’re all so nice here!\c\nI’m actually here on my honeymoon, and my\nbeautiful bride has completely fallen for this\r\nPokémon you have here called Rockruff!\c\nShe just can’t get enough of its curled little tail \nand that rocky fur around its neck.\c\nI’ve heard you can find them in Ten Carat Hill,\nbut I’m really lost here...
5	Could you go to Ten Carat Hill and catch one\nfor me?\c\nIf you do, then I can check out its information\nin your ’Dex, and then I can go catch one myself!\c\nI’ll even pay you for your hassle.\nThink of it as a bit of part-time work, OK?
6	It’s that Pokémon with the curled up tail.\nThe one you guys call Rockruff!\c\nThey’re supposed to live in Ten Carat Hill,\nso catch one for me, please!
7	Oh! You’ve caught a Rockruff!\nLet me see your ’Dex for a second!
8	Mm-hmm... I see...\c\nSo Rockruff hit the rocks around their necks\nagainst each other in a sort of greeting?\c\nWow. So, they’re not just cute...\nThey’re pretty interesting Pokémon, too.
9	All right. Thanks for this, pal!\nNow I’ll go and try to catch one for myself.\c\nHere. It’s not much, but here’s your pay.\nYou’ve earned it!
10	All right... Now it’s time that I set out to find\na Rockruff of my own for my beautiful bride!
11	Hey. Hey, kid.\nYou’re a Trainer, aren’t you?\c\nI bet you wouldn’t mind fulfilling the wishes of\nan alluring lady like myself, now would you?
12	Sure
13	I’m busy
14	This is ridiculous! Do your eyes work all right?\nHow can you pass by an alluring lady like me?!
15	Well, you can see my allure, of course.\nAnyone with eyes can.\c\nBut a woman can’t depend on such mature\nbeauty alone...\c\nShe must also have a cute side!\nA hint of charming sweetness!\c\nSo I’ve been thinking that I need to study that\nkind of cuteness from a cute Pokémon.
16	I’ve heard that there is a rather adorable\nPokémon called Drifloon in the Hau’oli Cemetery.\c\nDo you think you could catch one for me and\nregister it in your Pokédex?\c\nThey are round and soft and bob along as they\nmove... That sounds rather cute, doesn’t it?\c\nIf you keep your word and find one for me, then\nI’ll even pay you for the trouble, OK?
17	Catch me one of those round, soft Drifloon\nthat bob about in Hau’oli Cemetery, please!\c\nAnd beauty is fast to fade, so please be sure\nto find one in a hurry!
18	You’ve caught that Drifloon?\nWell then, show me your Pokédex!
19	Oh... Oh, no. This won’t work.\nIt’s cute, sure, but it’s a ghost or something...\c\nAnd they say it takes children off with it...\nI’m not interested in children. No thanks!
20	Well...this didn’t really work out the way that I\nhad hoped, but a promise is a promise.\c\nSo here is your pay for the work you did.
21	If I don’t figure out how to be adorable soon,\nI’ll have to learn how to dodder instead...
22	Hey, have you got a moment?\nYou live here in Alola, right?\c\nI’ve got a favor I’d like to ask. Do you mind?
23	No problem
24	I’m busy
25	Oh... Sorry, then.
26	Wow, thank you! I’m so glad that you would\nlisten to a request from a total stranger like me.\c\nI’m actually here in Alola with my darling hubby.\nIt’s our honeymoon!\c\nHe saw this Pokémon called Cutiefly on Route 3\nand it seems like my hubby was totally smitten\r\nwith it. We don’t have them back home, see.\c\nHe said it was too cute for words, with a yellow\nbody and a long, pointy proboscis!
27	Anyway, I wanted to ask if you could catch\none of those Cutiefly for me.\c\nIf I know what kind of Pokémon it is then I can\nprobably go and catch one myself.\c\nLike I said, I think that they’re somewhere on\nRoute 3.\c\nIf you catch one and come back to show me its\nPokédex entry, I can pay you for your trouble!
28	I guess you’ll be able to recognize Cutiefly by its\nyellow body and its long, pointy proboscis.\c\nI think he saw it on Route 3.
29	What? You’ve caught Cutiefly?\nThen would you mind showing me your ’Dex?
30	Hmm...\nSo it sucks up pollen and nectar from flowers\r\nusing that funny, long proboscis it has?\c\nIt is pretty cute! I wouldn’t mind one of these\nbuzzing around me!
31	Actually, I think I might want to get one of these\nCutiefly for myself now!\c\nLet me at least pay you like I promised first.\nThis is all I have, but it’s yours!
32	Thank you, young Trainer!\nI’ll go look for some Cutiefly at once!
33	You there! Trial-goer kid!\nI’m an old man and you’d better listen to me!
34	Sure
35	I’m busy
36	No! Don’t leave me here! Trial-goer kid!\nI’m so...so lonely...
37	I may not look like much now, but when I was a\nyoung lad, I was a captain, [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl!\c\nEven now I feel my pulse speed up whenever\nI see a trial-goer!\c\nSo listen to this old man’s request.\nLet me send you out on a trial I designed myself!
38	Do you know the beach near the Hano Grand\nResort on Akala?\c\nThere’s a curious Pokémon that lives there.\nCalled Pyukumuku, it is.\c\nGo and register it in your Pokédex, then report\nback to me here!\c\nIf you clear this trial, I’ll have a reward for you!
39	Register one of those Pyukumuku that you find\non Hano Beach in your Pokédex for me!
40	You’ve caught a Pyukumuku?!\nLet me see that! Hand over that Pokédex!
41	Mm... Indeed you have!\c\nThis is one of the Pokémon that folks think of\nwhen they think of the Alola region, you know!\c\nWhat’s more charming than its protective\ncoating and its bold defense mechanism?
42	I don’t have a Z-Crystal to give to you, but here\nis your reward for clearing my trial!
43	The island challenge is a precious part of\nAlola’s culture! I’ll be praying for your success!
44	Um...excuse me, but...could I ask you something?
45	Sure
46	I’m busy
47	Oh, I see...\nSorry to bother you then...
48	Thank you for giving me some of your time.\c\nYou see, I’m doing a study about the effects of\nwater quality on Pokémon, and right now I am\r\nlooking into the situation in Brooklet Hill.\c\nI’m currently surveying whether a Pokémon\ncalled Feebas can be found living there.\c\nBut I’m terrible at fishing, and so I’m not making\nany progress at all...
49	Do you think I could offer you a bit of part-time\nwork as a research assistant?\c\nCould you try to catch a Feebas for me in\nBrooklet Hill?\c\nIt’s a rather shabby looking Pokémon, so I think\nyou’ll have no trouble recognizing it if you see it.\c\nIf you manage to catch one, please come and\nshow me your Pokédex data.\c\nI have enough budget to pay you, so please!
50	I need to see a Feebas from Brooklet Hill.\nPlease...help me out...
51	You’ve caught the Feebas?\nThen will you show me your Pokédex?
52	So there it is...\c\nFeebas really is a strong creature.\nIt can survive even in the most polluted water.\c\nSome researchers have hypothesized that it\nmay even dislike clean water, but if it lives in\r\nBrooklet Hill, then that is clearly not the case!
53	Thank you. You’ve been a great help!\nHere. For your assistance.
54	You’ve been a great help with my research.\nNow I should be able to make some progress!
55	Why, hello, Trainer.\nLooks like you’ve got a Pokédex on you.\c\nHow would you like to do a little part-time work\non behalf of the Aether Foundation?
56	Sure
57	I’m busy
58	Well, that is a shame.\nCome back if you ever have the time.
59	We at the Aether Foundation work to protect\nPokémon through conservation.\c\nIn order to protect Pokémon, though, we must\nknow a good deal about them and how they live.\c\nRight now, we are surveying the Stufful that\nlive on Route 8.\c\nThe foundation is collecting its own data, of\ncourse, but we would also like to know what\r\ndata the Pokédex records about them.
60	So your job, if you should choose to accept it,\nwould be to register the Stufful on Route 8 in\r\nyour Pokédex and then show us the data.\c\nWe will pay you for the work, of course.\nI hope you’ll help us out.
61	Please show us the data that your Pokédex\nrecords about the Stufful living on Route 8.\c\nIt is a very adorable Pokémon.\nI’m sure you’ll recognize it at once.
62	You’ve caught a Stufful?\nThen would you show me your Pokédex?
63	I see...\c\nThe biology of this Stufful is one that we hadn’t\nyet uncovered in our own research...\c\nThis is just the level of detail that I knew we\ncould expect from the Pokédex!
64	Thank you very much!\nHere is your pay.
65	Thank you for helping us with our research.\c\nI think we’ll have an even better understanding\nof Stufful thanks to this.
66	Hey! You!\nYou’ve got a Rotom Dex, haven’t you?\c\nThen I’ve got the perfect job for you!\nWhat do you say? Will you take me up on it?
67	Sure
68	I’m busy
69	Hrmmm. Well, that is a shame.\nIt was a pretty sweet offer, too...
70	I’m an employee of a place called the Aether\nFoundation.\c\nWe’re doing a survey right now of a Pokémon\ncalled Passimian, which lives in Lush Jungle.\c\nBut I’ve had no luck finding any of them, and\nI’m in a real tough spot now...
71	If you happen to catch a Passimian, would you\nshow me the data from your Pokédex?\c\nIf you help me out, I can pay you for your work!
72	Passimian live in Lush Jungle.\c\nIt’s a real dexterous one and handles Berries\nlike a pro. I think you’ll know it when you see it.
73	You caught a Passimian?\nThen will you show me your ’Dex?
74	So, that’s it...\c\nThere’re things here that we couldn’t figure out\nfrom the data the foundation had collected...
75	Thanks a lot! Here, this is for you!
76	Now we know a bit more about how Passimian\nlive out in nature.\c\nThanks for helping out with the Aether\nFoundation’s efforts!
77	Hey! You!\nYou’ve got a Rotom Dex, haven’t you?\c\nThen I’ve got the perfect job for you!\nWhat do you say? Will you take me up on it?
78	Sure
79	I’m busy
80	Hrmmm. Well, that is a shame.\nIt was a pretty sweet offer, too...
81	I’m an employee of a place called the Aether\nFoundation.\c\nWe’re doing a survey right now of a Pokémon\ncalled Oranguru, which lives in Lush Jungle.\c\nBut I’ve had no luck finding any of them, and\nI’m in a real tough spot now...
82	If you happen to catch an Oranguru, would you\nshow me the data from your Pokédex?\c\nIf you help me out, I can pay you for your work!
83	Oranguru live in Lush Jungle.\c\nIt looks kind of like an old man, all dressed in\nwhite. I think you’ll know it when you see it.
84	You caught an Oranguru?\nThen will you show me your ’Dex?
85	So, that’s it...\c\nThere’re things here that we couldn’t figure out\nfrom the data the foundation had collected...
86	Thanks a lot! Here, this is for you!
87	Now we know a bit more about how Oranguru\nlive out in nature.\c\nThanks for helping out with the Aether\nFoundation’s efforts!
88	Um, could I borrow a moment of your time?\nJust a moment, mind you.
89	Sure
90	I’m busy
91	O-oh... Of course. You’re busy.\nHow silly of me to try talking to you...
92	Th-thank you very much.\c\nYou see...I’ve fallen in love at first sight!\nWith a Pokémon called Togedemaru!\c\nI love it to bits... I love it so much that I can’t\nbear to even catch one for myself!\c\nSo I wanted to ask a favor...\nCould you catch a Togedemaru for me and then\r\nshow me its Pokédex entry so I can see it?
93	I think you’ll find some adorable Togedemaru\naround the power plant.\c\nIts pointed little needles are just so adorable\nthat I’m sure you’ll get it as soon as you see it.\c\nAnd I can promise to reward you if you do this\nfor me! So please!
94	I think you’ll find the adorable little Togedemaru\naround the power plant.\c\nIts pointed little needles are just so adorable\nthat I’m sure you’ll get it as soon as you see it.
95	What?! You actually caught a Togedemaru?!\nThe Pokédex! Give it here! At once!
96	Oooh... My little Togedemaru...\nHow adorable you are...\c\nI just want to feel your little needles tickling\nme all over...
97	Oh! This is the best! Just wonderful!\nHere is your payment, as promised!
98	I got to know my beloved Togedemaru even\nbetter than before!\c\nThank you for this! Have a wonderful journey!
99	You’re a Trainer, right?\nWanna do a little job for me?
100	Sure
101	I’m busy
102	Hmph. Fine then.\nIf you change your mind, though, come see me.
103	I’m looking for information about a Pokémon\ncalled Mimikyu.\c\nSo how about you go and catch a Mimikyu\nfor me?\c\nThen you can show me the data that your\nPokédex records for it, right?
104	It’s this odd little thing that looks like it’s got\na sack on its head. Lives at the site of the\r\nabandoned Thrifty Megamart. You know it?\c\nSo go find one for me. If you do a good job,\nI’ll even pay you for the trouble.
105	That Pikachu-looking Mimikyu should be\nhanging out in the abandoned Thrifty Megamart.\c\nGo catch one in a flash to get it registered in\nyour Pokédex, then come back to show me.
106	Caught that Mimikyu?\nThis must be my lucky day. Show me your ’Dex!
107	See that? It’s just like I said...\c\nIt’s gotta be a really scary Pokémon under that\ncloth, right? No one knows what’s in there...\c\nEven if it’s my job, they can’t just expect me\nto come survey scary ghost Pokémon like that!\c\nI’ll just copy the data from your Pokédex here,\nsubmit it to my boss, and call it a day.
108	Thanks a bunch, pal.\nNow I won’t get chewed out by my boss.\c\nTake your payment. No need to be shy about it.
109	I joined the Aether Foundation ’cause I thought\nthe uniforms were really cool looking, but...\c\nPokémon conservation and all is actually a lot\nmore hard work than I expected...\r\nIt’s no good just following a whim, you know?

0	I’ve been waiting for you!\c\nNow let me explain about the Reassembly Unit.[VAR 0114(0026)]
1	Sina...\nYou don’t waste even a second.[VAR 0114(0027)]
2	Have you been collecting Zygarde’s Cells\nand Cores?[VAR 0114(0026)]
3	You’ve collected fewer than 10 Cells\nand Cores combined...[VAR 0114(0027)]
4	You’ve collected 10 or more Cells\nand Cores combined.[VAR 0114(0027)]
5	Anyway, I’ll explain![VAR 0114(0026)]
6	The Reassembly Unit is a device that has\nsomething to do with the Pokémon Zygarde.\c\nThe machine is capable of assembly and\nseparation of Zygarde.[VAR 0114(0026)]
7	Assembly is...to create a Pokémon\ncalled Zygarde!\c\nNow, Dexio, it’s your turn.[VAR 0114(0026)]
8	Oh...Sina, Sina, Sina...\nAnyway...\c\nThere are two ways to assemble Zygarde.\c\nOne is to add Cells you collected\nto Zygarde.[VAR 0114(0027)]
9	The other is to create a new Zygarde with\nonly Cells![VAR 0114(0026)]
10	Next we’ll explain about separation.[VAR 0114(0027)]
11	To separate Zygarde...\nit means to return Zygarde to its Cells![VAR 0114(0026)]
12	Separated Cells will be returned to the\nZygarde Cube.[VAR 0114(0027)]
13	For your information, according to the research\nby the professor who’s sent us to Alola,\r\nZygarde is divided into 100 Cells and Cores.[VAR 0114(0027)]
14	Depending on the number of Cells and Cores,\nthe shape of Zygarde will be different...\r\nIn other words, Zygarde changes its Forme![VAR 0114(0026)]
15	Zygarde is said to maintain the order of the\nKalos region...then why is it in Alola...?\c\nIs it a sign that something is about to happen?[VAR 0114(0027)]
16	If you collect Zygarde’s Cells and Cores, you\nmay get the answer. Anyhow...\c\nwe’ll be taking our leave now!\nBon voyage![VAR 0114(0026)]

8	Hey! Hey! HEY!\c\nDidn’t you hear me?\nBeat us five Trainers and you win a prize!\c\nYou’ve gotta beat the five Trainers on the\nbridge, you dolt!
391
0	Welcome to the Trainers’ School!\nI’m the principal.
1	What an honor for me and the school!\c\nTo think that our teachings would not only give\nrise to a captain but to a League Champion!
2	Despite your lofty accomplishments, though, I’d\nhazard that you still don’t know everything that\r\nthe Trainer School has to teach you, eh?\c\nThen allow me to give you a special, expert\nlesson from the principal herself!
3	Just as the saying goes, even the fool may\ngive the wise man good counsel if he listens.\c\nI may have lost, but heed my advice and use\nthis. It is one of my favorite items.
4	If your Pokémon is holding the King’s Rock, its\nattacks may make an opponent flinch.\c\nAnd that’s the end of what I can teach you.\nI’m glad I was able to meet you here.
5	If I can defeat h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer, then that will mean that our\nschool’s principal is stronger than a Champion.\c\nAnd even if I lose, we can still boast that we’re\nthe school who helped create a Champion.\c\nOh, it’s too good! It’s just too good! Ho ho ho!\nI can’t wipe this stupid grin off my face!
6	Urk. Nothing. I didn’t say anything.
392
0	I’m terribly sorry, [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]sirmiss...\c\nBut the Battle Buffet isn’t open yet!

73	How satisfied are you?[VAR 0114(002D)]
74	Hmmm...\nAs far as I can tell...[VAR 0114(002D)]
75	You look like someone who’s totally\nsatisfied by your belly full of delicious goodies![VAR 0114(002D)]
76	You look pretty full! You must be satisfied![VAR 0114(002D)]
77	What a stern look! Looks like you didn’t get\nenough to eat![VAR 0114(002D)]

87	Heehee. Way to go!\c\nI knew you could do it when I first laid eyes\non you![VAR 0114(002D)]

95	Hehe. There’s a whole world of delicious\ngoodies out there you know nothing about!\r\nI’m gonna go eat ’em all up![VAR 0114(002D)]
96	Hmmph![VAR 0114(002D)]
97	To eat or not to eat?\nHmmm...\c\nAllow me to consult my stomach.
98	After consulting with my stomach,\nit seems that we’re fated to battle!
99	[~ 99]
100	What should I eat next?\nLet me know, stomach...
101	The food of commoners always looks so quaint.\c\nWo-wonderful!
102	You seem to have your eye on it, so it must be\ngood commoner food.\c\nI’ll be taking my share—all of it!
103	[~ 103]
104	What a quaint idea this “buffet” system is!\nI do enjoy being around you commoners!
105	*slurp*
106	Heh. Looks tasty, doesn’t it? That’s because I\nmade it all!\c\nI take the responsibility of tasting everything\nvery seriously!
107	[~ 107]
108	I became a Cook because I love food, but all I do\nis cook, not eat! It’s really frustrating...
109	What sort of cuisine do they serve here?
110	Ooh, so before we partake of the main course,\nwe can start off with an appetizer of a\r\nPokémon battle!
111	[~ 111]
112	There are many kinds of cuisine in the world.
113	Hi-yah! I need all the nutrients I can get\nbefore I head to the mountains for my training!
114	You have to fight if you want to eat! In other\nwords, welcome to the Battle Buffet!
115	[~ 115]
116	The sadness of being unable to eat what I want\nis intense. If I can get over it, I’ll become\r\neven stronger!
117	Strong Trainers gather to eat popular dishes...\nThis is going to take some skills!
118	I’m normally just a Pokémon Breeder!\c\nHere at the buffet I become a warrior loyal only\nto my appetite!
119	[~ 119]
120	I’m the type who gets all excited when\nI’m hungry.
121	Eating is truly the greatest pleasure we have\nin life! You’ll understand when you get older.
122	I feel like if I can just eat this delicious food,\nmy meeting will go better!
123	[~ 123]
124	Ah, who cares about my boss?\c\nIf I don’t get something good to eat,\nI don’t think I can take it anymore!
125	Don’t worry about me. I’m just looking.\nNo, really, I’m just looking.
126	Hang on a second! I can’t help it!\nI do want to eat after all!
127	[~ 127]
128	What do you think of girls who eat a lot?
129	Only the strong can eat! Muwuhahaha!\nSounds like my kind of place!
130	Your food is my food now!\nAnd I’m about to devour my food!
131	[~ 131]
132	No food for the weak...\nAnd I thought this was my kind of place...
133	I’m gonna fill up on some tasty food.\nIt might be tough...
134	What do you think you’re doing?!\c\nI saw it first! You think I’m\ngonna just let you take it?!
135	[~ 135]
136	They always have plenty of\ndishes no one likes left over...
137	I’m no Youngster!\nI’m a starving monster!
138	My favorite things, huh? That’s easy!\nTasty treats and Pokémon battles!
139	[~ 139]
140	I guess Youngsters can’t\nactually become monsters...
141	The law of the jungle is the only rule here\nat the Battle Buffet!
142	Hey, stop that! That’s mine!\nI told you, it’s the law of the jungle!
143	[~ 143]
144	I thought it had something\nto do with a jungle gym...
145	For this amount of food...\nand these ingredients...\c\nLet me see...\nAccording to my calculations...
146	OK! This dish will be indispensable\nif I want to get my money’s worth!
147	[~ 147]
148	What a fool I was...\nCalories had nothing to do with it...
149	I like this tense atmosphere.\c\nTo eat is to live, so everyone here is so serious.
150	Hey, if you can beat me,\ndo you want me to feed you?
151	[~ 151]
152	Open up, here it comes!
153	I can keep going.\nI can still eat more...\c\nI’ve got to eat a ton to make this worth it!
154	Whether you get to eat or not,\nit’s $1,200!\c\nIf that’s the case, I’ve got no choice but to eat!
155	[~ 155]
156	Your Pokémon and your appetite sure\nare healthy!
157	Dine here
158	Hear the explanation
159	Come back later

173	We look forward to seeing you again soon!
174	Really? You already want a rematch? I’m too full\nto eat another bite today![VAR 0114(002D)]
175	Why don’t you come back and see me\ntomorrow, cutie?[VAR 0114(002D)]
176	Ooh, it all looks so delish! What should I eat?[VAR 0114(002D)]
177	Are you leaving?
178	If you leave partway through, you’ll lose all the\ndishes you’ve already gotten. Is that OK?
179	Please continue enjoying the Battle Buffet.
180	Oh, do my eyes deceive me, or are you\nour Champion?
181	I knew it! Thank you so much for\ncoming, Champion!\c\nAllow me to show you to a seat worthy of\nsomeone of your status!

4	Hyah! Hiii-yah!\nHyah! Hyah!
5	Shhh, quiet now.\c\nThere are many others resting in these plots.
6	Hiii-yah! Hyah hyah hyah!
7	Come now, dry those tears.\nWe’re all done with tears, aren’t we? You and I.\c\nIf we come here, we can see him again any\ntime that we want to.\c\nAnd as long as we don’t forget him, he will\nalways be with us...
8	Hyah...
9	Hyah?!
10	Oh! Hello, young Trainer.\nI’m sorry for all of this one’s noise.
11	Hyah!
12	This is my husband’s grave.\nAnd this silly one here was his Pokémon.
13	Hyah! Hyah! Hiiii-yah!
14	It was...an accident.\c\nBut my husband sent Machamp back into its\nball at the moment of the crash.\r\nIt was a miracle that Machamp survived.\r\nBut my husband...\c\nWell, ever since the accident, Machamp here\nhas hated being inside a Poké Ball.\r\nIn fact it flung its own ball off somewhere.
15	Hi-yaaaaaahhh!
16	Of course I was devastated when my husband\npassed away.\c\nAnd there were times when I hated that other\nman, who caused the accident.\c\nBut that man...\nHe had a family, too. A young wife.\c\nWhen I saw her face, I just couldn’t go on hating\nanyone for what happened.
17	Oh, I’m sorry...\nI didn’t mean to say all that...
18	Thank you for letting an old woman ramble so.\c\nThis belonged to my husband, but I’d be happy\nif you could use it.
19	Do you also use Ride Pokémon to get around?\c\nIt is fun and quite convenient, but please do\nbe careful not to get in any accidents.\c\nTake care, young Trainer.
20	Good night for today, darling...\nWe’ll come visit again tomorrow night.

4	Was there something you wanted my help with?\nOh, you want me to judge some Pokémon?
5	Then I’ll update your PC Boxes for you.\c\nWith this, you can get your Pokémon judged\nanytime that you’ve got access to a PC!

0	Are you out and about on your island challenge?\nWhen you’ve completed it, come on back.\r\nDon’t forget about me here, OK?
1	That [VAR 0101(0000)] of yours...\nI don’t know why, but it sure takes me back!
2	You know Mankey, right?\nI’m actually the one who came up with it!\c\nThe boss told me to make a Pokémon with a bit\nof this and a bit of that, and that’s what I drew!\c\nI’m pretty fond of it myself!
3	You know, I thought up the Pokémon moves\nmyself and programmed ’em in myself, too.\c\nSo I never really wrote down the details or\nanything. Sorry about that...
4	We had a poll in the company once a long time\nago to see which Pokémon was most popular...\c\nand back then the winner was Exeggutor!
5	Tauros used to be real strong, huh?\c\nI was the one who thought up that one.\nBut Blizzard was a bit too strong, eh?
6	You know Diglett, right?\c\nIt’s actually basically just a character that I\nhad made up when I was a little kid.\r\nI even drew up a flip-book featuring it then!
7	You know Mew, right?\c\nI made it. Everything about it. The pixel art,\nits cry, its Pokédex entry, everything.\c\nI just barely finished in time, too! It was right at\nthe very end of the game’s development!
8	Can I tell you a little something, just between\nyou and me?\c\nSee, the Japanese version of Pokémon Blue was\nan exclusive release when it first came out.\r\nOnly certain people could get it.\c\nFrom what I heard, that was a real pain for the\npeople working in the shops that sold it...
9	We were all young folks in the office back when\nwe first made Pokémon Blue to be sold in Japan.\c\nNow we’re all a bunch of middle-aged coots.
10	Back in the day, the programming used up all\nthe space on a cartridge, so if we wanted to\r\nadd something new, we had to clean it up first...\c\nFirst we’d find enough space, then we could\nmake what we wanted... It was a pain!
11	In that one game, you could talk to the Pokémon\nfollowing you to find out how it was doing.\r\nI was the one who came up with that idea!
12	I heard something from Masuda one time...\c\nApparently the sound that plays when you save\nis different in each version...\c\nI gotta tell you...I can’t tell any difference at all!
13	Just between you and me, but...\c\nWhen we were working on these new titles once,\nI got told to come up with version differences...\r\nBoy, I was gobsmacked!\c\nBut in the end, I’m glad I helped make them.
14	Your lead Pokémon’s Nature is [VAR 0108(0001)].\nThat means its Attack stat will grow easily.\c\nMy explanation could grow pretty easily, too,\nbut I’ll keep it short and sweet for you.

19	Your lead Pokémon’s Nature is [VAR 0108(0001)].\nThat means all its stats grow about the same.\c\nIf it’s all the same to you.
20	I’d say I’m pretty up to speed on Pokémon\nbattling. What do you think?\r\nWant to battle me? I’m really good, you know?
21	Let’s battle
22	Let’s not
23	Whoops! I forgot to save before the battle...\nbut I’m going to win anyway, so it’s fine.
24	Oh yeah? Well, that’s a real shame.\nI’m really good, after all.
25	You’re really good, too.\nAfter all, you managed to beat me.\r\nYou can brag about it, if you want.\c\nHere, I’ll even heal up your Pokémon since you\ndared to take me on in battle.
26	I’ll let you fight me again sometime, if you want.\nJust once a day, though, OK?\c\nSo come back tomorrow.\nThough I’ll probably have forgotten you already.
27	I’m not gonna fight you again today.\nYou’ve got to come back tomorrow.
28	Oh, you’re a player!\nWe’ve been making games here.\r\nWhat color would you choose?
29	Red
30	Green
31	Blue
32	Yellow
33	Red, huh? Interesting!\nI’d say you’re probably the type who stays\r\ntrue to your heart and says what you want.
34	Green, huh? Interesting!\nI’d say you’re pretty dedicated to our game,\r\nthen. Are you a fanatic, maybe?
35	Blue, huh? Interesting!\nI’d say you’re probably the type who does what\r\nyou want, even if it’s not the popular thing.
36	Pi! Pikachu!\nPika pika chu!
37	Clefairy is the cutest, isn’t it?\nOooh, I just want to hug it!
38	Ciao!\nI just finished an awesome song!
39	Being able to finally work on the games that I\nspent so long playing... It’s a dream come true!
40	I want to keep working on the game, so I’ve got\nto keep my energy up! I need some vitamins!\c\nHere, I’ll give you one, too!\nThanks for stopping by!
41	[~ 41]
42	Have fun on your adventure!
43	And here. I’ll give you this, too.\c\nWith one of these, the Pokémon you drop off at\nthe Pokémon Nursery will have a better chance\r\nthan usual of finding a Pokémon Egg.

0	Welcome to...\c\n... ...\c\nI’m sorry, but...\nare you [VAR 0100(0000)]?
1	I am
2	You know me?
3	I thought you must be.
4	From my son.
5	Guzma has actually come home a few times\nsince...all that.\c\nAnd he told me to give you this if you ever\ncame by.
6	It was always one of his favorite TMs.\c\nHe won so many trophies when he entered\nbattle competitions with the Pokémon that\r\nhe’d taught to use Swagger.
7	I know that there were a lot of rumors flying\naround, saying that our Guzma was up to no\r\ngood and doing terrible things...\c\nbut I know it was all just lies.
401
0	Eggcellent!\nSince you’re here, let me show you something!
1	Shiny Exeggcute!\nGolden, shining Exeggcute!\r\nAll six of them glitter so eggcellently!
2	I’d love to share one with you, but even though\nthey look like six Exeggcute, they are just one!\c\nBut if I can’t give you one of my shiny gold\nExeggcute, these should be close enough!
3	I’ve heard that Exeggcute in Alola evolve with\nsome kind of stone.\c\nBut I’m afraid that Nuggets don’t ever evolve\ninto Big Nuggets, no matter what you do...
402
0	...Ora?
1	It is holding something out to you...\nWill you take it?
2	Take it
3	Leave it
4	There you are!
5	...Mmm.
6	This fellow here’s my partner, Gru the Oranguru.\c\nBut he just hasn’t really taken a liking to me.\nMaybe he hasn’t known me long enough yet.\c\nHe often gets out on his own like this.\nI don’t know, maybe he feels stressed?
7	Mmph.
8	Did he maybe give you something?
9	Let me remind you that lying to an officer is an\noffense! I could have you up on charges!\c\nSo let me ask you one more time...
10	Ohhh, Gru...!\nThat was locked up in our safe!\c\nOranguru are clever Pokémon, so I’m sure Gru\nhere had no problem getting the safe open.
11	Mmm.
12	Sigh... Fine.\c\nYou take it then.\nUse it however you’d like.
13	Mmm.
14	I guess Gru must’ve gotten this nasty habit of\nlifting things from his old Trainer.\r\nSmart as a whip, but real sticky fingers.\c\nIt makes him a handful to control, but it’s not\nlike I can just ignore him till his old Trainer\r\ngets out of jail and comes back for him, right?\c\nSorry for complaining to you about my problems.\nHere, take this and be on your way.
15	And don’t feel like you’ve got to pay me back in\nkind for that Return.\c\nFavors don’t always need returning.\nThat’s not why I’m doing any of this.\c\nI just hope this fellow here can straighten out\nbefore his old Trainer gets back.
16	...Mmph.
403
0	I came all the way from Johto to visit Alola.\nIs it true you can’t use Fly to fly around here?
1	I don’t know. Is it?
2	Yes, it is
3	Seems like! I got told off for trying it!\nThey said it was some kind of law or something!\c\nBut then how do folks in Alola fly around?
4	Wow... So it’s really a thing?\nThis really is a whole different region.\c\nBut then how do folks in Alola fly around?
5	On Charizard
6	With a Ride Pager
7	Wow... So everyone just rides around on special\nCharizard that’ve been raised for the job?\c\nSounds weird, if you ask me, but I’ve gotta admit\nthat riding on a Charizard would be a blast!
8	Ho, so that’s how it works, huh?\nSpecial gear that can call Pokémon?\c\nI’d heard that Alola had a great transportation\nsystem, but it’s really true, huh?
9	Thanks for teaching me about how things are\nhere in Alola.\c\nHere, you might as well have this!
10	Back where I’m from, in Johto, this kind of TM\nis a real big deal.\c\nThey’re called Hidden Machines, or HMs,\nbecause they’re so hard to get your hands on.\c\nBut here I guess it’s just another TM.\nMaybe you can use it in battle or something!
11	The way people live can be different depending\non where they live.\c\nThe value of things also depends on where you\nhappen to be.\c\nOne of the best things about traveling is getting\nto feel and understand that up close.

1	There is something written on his chest...\c\n“I’m just a poor Hypno.\nShare some love.”\c\nThe eerie Hypno keeps on staring at you...
2	Ignore him
3	Give him $1
4	Give him $100
5	Give him $1,000
6	Bah!
7	Hmph!
8	Zzz.
9	Wowzers!\nYou’re really giving me this?!
10	It looked like a Hypno, but it’s actually just a\nperson wearing a Pokémon costume...
11	Look at you, big spender!\nI figured someone might give me money if only I\r\npretended to be a Pokémon, but I had no luck...\r\nuntil now, that is!\c\nYou’re the first big donor I’ve had!\nA shining example of humanity!\c\nI’m so touched that I’ve got to do something\nto pay you back for this. Here, take this!
12	Rest seems like a good move for a Hypno, right?\c\nI won’t give you back your money, of course,\nbut I’d be happy to let you have that!
13	Now, I guess I’d better get back to work!\c\nI can’t get anything if my cover is blown, so\ndon’t you talk to me no more either!
14	Szz...\n(Shoo! Leave me alone!)
407
0	I heard that other regions have these “Pokémon\nDay Care” places...\c\nApparently you can leave Pokémon there, and\nthey’ll raise your Pokémon for you.
1	We’ve got nurseries here in Alola, but all we\ndo is hold on to your Pokémon for you.\c\nWe don’t help them get stronger or learn any\nmoves, but I’d guess we’re easier on your wallet!
2	Oh, and there is something else!\nIf you leave two Pokémon together at the\r\nnursery, you sometimes end up finding an Egg!\c\nSince we’re talking about it, do you want one of\nthe Eggs I found here at the nursery recently?
3	Thanks for taking it off my hands!\c\nAnd don’t go trying to crack it just because you\ncan’t wait to see what’s inside!\c\nThough I’ve never heard of a Pokémon Egg\ncracking except when it’s ready to hatch.
4	Oh, yeah? Well, I’ll hold on to it for now, but if\nyou change your mind, this Egg can be yours!
5	Do you want one of the Eggs I found here at the\nnursery recently?
6	If you carry a Pokémon Egg around with you,\nit will hatch into a Pokémon.\c\nI bet it must feel pretty happy being surrounded\nby your team, even before it’s born.
7	Whoa! You can’t even take an Egg?!\nHow many Pokémon have you caught?!\c\nI guess I’ll hold on to it for now, but it’s yours\nif you ever want it.
408
0	Would you just look at those biceps!\nThey’re bulging with strength!\r\nThey’re practically big enough to burst!
1	Can you even imagine how far you’d be able\nto drive a golf ball with muscles like those?!
2	Mah...
3	The Machamp seems uncomfortable...\c\nShould you stop them?\nYou’ll probably get dragged into a battle...
4	Stop them
5	Let them be
6	Uh, excuse you?\nWhat do you think you’re doing?\c\nWe hired this big fella to be our caddy.\c\nAnd we’re in the middle of something important\nright now, so how about you get out of my grill?
7	Yeah, just get lost, would you?
8	Are you even serious about this?\nYou’ve only got one Pokémon that can fight!\c\nThere’s no point in even battling someone like\nyou!
9	What is up with you...
10	I know, right? Just totally killed the mood.\nLet’s just go...
11	Geez, you little...\c\nWhat was that, huh?\nYou trying to be a hero or something?\c\nWhat’d you go and do that for, huh?\c\nI’m not a Pokémon...\nI’m a born-and-bred human being, duh!\c\nThis is just a costume!
12	Like, seriously, [VAR 1100(00FF,0404)]dudelady...\nAre you just here to ruin my day?\c\nGoing and blowing all the hard work that I put\ninto disguising myself as a Machamp caddy...\c\nI was going to make some real bank off this job!\c\nAnd then...you had to come along and try to\n“rescue” me...\c\nMan, I want to cry right now...\nBut I know you were just trying to help.\c\nI can’t get mad for what you did...\nSo here... Just take this...
13	Now get lost...\nAnd don’t you talk to me again...
14	Mah...\n(I told you not to talk to me...)

0	Hey. I’d like to say welcome to my shop,\nbut I’m afraid I just can’t do that right now.
1	Peli peli!
2	That fellow is my partner.\nPelly the Pelipper.\c\nHe helps me out with making deliveries, using\nthat big old beak and that throat pouch of his.
3	Peli peli.
4	I normally travel around the islands, dealing my\nwares wherever I come ashore.\c\nBut I’ve been here at Poni for quite a while now,\nand my supplies have pretty much run dry.
5	I’m in a real slump, and Pelly here is pretty much\ncrying out in boredom.
6	... ... ...
7	Hey! You’re supposed to be crying out, I said!\nWhat kind of partner are you?!
8	... ... ...
9	Why you...
10	Anyway, I do appreciate you taking the time\nto stop by anyway, so I hope you’ll take these.
11	Those two are real valuable power boosters!
12	I know it’s a generous gift, but that’s just who\nI am! Right, Pelly?\c\nPelly?
13	... ... ...
14	Come on! Throw me a bone here, Pelly!\nI thought you were my partner!
15	I really should be heading out onto the waves\nagain soon, but it’s so nice around here.\c\nWe seafolk and our chief and even me, we all\ncouldn’t seem to help but fall in love with Poni.
16	Peli pelip.

4	...You sure about that?\nHow long have you known him then, hm?\c\nGa ha ha! I’m just joshing you, kid.\nI like to see a kid with confidence.\c\nBut I think I know who you really are.\nYou’re [VAR 0100(0000)], ain’t you?
5	I’m Kiawe’s old man.\nI’m glad he’s made friends like you.\c\nYou’re the first-ever Champion in Alola,\nain’t you?\c\nAnd at that tender age even!\nThat’s quite the accomplishment, kid.
6	I reckon I ought to give you a little gift to help\nyou celebrate becoming Champion, then.
7	Give that there to a Rhydon to hold, and then\ntrade it with a friend. You’ll see what happens.\c\nCourse there are no Rhydon native to Alola, but\nif you ever find one, give it a try for me, eh?
8	That boy of mine was pretty happy to hear that\nyou’d become Champion like that.\c\nI hope you’ll stay friends with him. He may not\nlook it, but he’s always been a lonely child.

1	But you’re a Pokémon Trainer, aren’t you?\c\nThen how about a quiz that takes weather into\nthe arena of Pokémon battles?\c\nIt will take a bit longer doing it like this, but I’ll\ngive you a reward if you can keep up!
2	It looks like you have what it takes.\nThen tell me, my good Trainer...\c\nWhich item would you have a Pokémon hold\nif you want Rain Dance to last a long time?
3	That’s it! Correct!\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Damp Rock uses Rain\nDance, the rain will keep falling for eight turns!\c\nBut I’m not beaten yet!\nNext question!
4	Oooh, that’s a shame...\nThe correct answer was the Damp Rock.\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Damp Rock uses Rain\nDance, the rain will keep falling for eight turns.\c\nBut I suppose everyone makes mistakes...\nLet’s move on to the next question!
5	Which item would you have a Pokémon hold\nif you want Hail to last a long time?
6	That’s it! Correct!\c\nIf a Pokémon holding an Icy Rock uses Hail,\nthe hail will keep falling for eight whole turns!\c\nBut I’ve still got some HP in me!\nNext question!
7	Oooh, that’s a shame...\nThe correct answer was the Icy Rock.\c\nIf a Pokémon holding an Icy Rock uses Hail,\nthe hail will keep on falling for eight turns.\c\nBut I suppose everyone makes mistakes...\nLet’s move on to the next question!
8	Which item would you have a Pokémon hold\nif you want sunshine that goes on for ages?
9	That’s it! Correct!\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Heat Rock uses Sunny\nDay, the sun will shine forth for eight turns!\c\nBut I’m still in this match!\nNext question!
10	Oooh, that’s a shame...\nThe correct answer was the Heat Rock.\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Heat Rock uses Sunny\nDay, the sun will shine forth for eight turns.\c\nBut I suppose everyone makes mistakes...\nLet’s move on to the next question!

14	The most important part of any education is\nputting it to work in the real world.\c\nIt’s not enough to understand it in your head.\nYou’ve got to know it in your bones!\c\nThat’s why I’ll give you this set of rocks I’ve\ncollected for your own use.
15	There are lots of ways to use the weather to\nyour advantage in battles, so give it a try.\c\nLike you could use rain to power up your\nWater-type moves or to weaken the Fire-type\r\nmoves someone might use against you.\c\nOr you could call a sandstorm to deal damage\nevery turn to any Pokémon that isn’t a Rock,\r\nGround, or Steel type.

1	...Hold on a second there, pal.\c\nYou look to me like a kid...\c\nbuuut I can tell just by looking at you that you’re\na pretty decent Trainer.\c\nSure, I’m just a part-time worker now, pounding\naway at the register with a smile on my face,\r\nbut once I was a Trainer, traveling around on\r\nmy island challenge, too.
2	I even made a pretty fair name for myself.\nKagetora the Eevee User, that was me.\c\nBut then I got a wife, and then I had a kid...\nNow I face a new trial called a mortgage.\c\nAnd I work here to prepare me for the most\ngrand trial of all: old age and retirement!
3	...But never mind all that.\c\nLook, there’s something I’d like to ask an able\nyoung Trainer like you to do for me.\c\nBack in my heyday, there were these eight older\nTrainers I was always trying to beat.\c\nThey all used Pokémon that evolve from Eevee.\c\nHow would you feel about taking them on?\c\nIf you say that Kagetora sent you, I’m sure\nthey’ll agree to a battle.
4	If you can beat them all for me, I’ll have\nsomething to give you. It’ll be worth it.\c\nSo just ask me if you want to know more about\nany of ’em.

Everyone was afraid of him.\c\nHis Umbreon gave off its horrifying aura all the\ntime and never let up...\c\nHe used to hold some kind of ceremony in the\ncemetery on Melemele Island every night...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw him, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find him.
20	Miss Absolute Zero...\nRea the Glaceon User.\c\nThat cool beauty seemed to have a soul of ice\nwhen she mercilessly pursued her opponents.\c\nEven time froze around her Glaceon!\c\nI know that she originally came from some small\nvillage on Melemele Island...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw her, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find her.
21	A goddess of beauty in full bloom...\nLinnea the Leafeon User.\c\nShe was a world-famous model and a powerful\nGrass-type Pokémon user.\c\nWhen her Leafeon cried out, even withered and\ndead trees burst into bloom once more...\c\nShe used to always stay at the Hano Grand\nResort when she was between gigs...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw her, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find her.
22	The queen of Fairy Pokémon...\nYes, Sakura the Sylveon User.\c\nThat pure young maiden was adored by Fairy-\ntype Pokémon, who saw her as a queen.\c\nEven wild beasts were captivated when her\nSylveon appeared before them...\c\nI heard that she was a descendant of the\nnomadic seafolk...\c\nThat’s the best hint I can give you to find her.
23	Got it.\nRemember, I’m counting on you, kid.
24	Oh, it’s you.\c\nWait, what?! You beat them all?!\nWhat happened then?!
25	... ...\n... ...\c\nTime truly is cruel to us all, isn’t it?\c\nFine then. I’m ready now.
26	I have one last favor to ask of you.\nWould you let me have a battle?
27	Of course
28	Hold on
29	If I do this, I think I’ll be ready...to let go.
30	I understand... I’ll wait.
31	Enough. It’s enough.\nOur day has come...and it has gone.\c\nBut I haven’t forgotten your reward.\nHere. I want you to take this.
32	I used that crystal back when I was a young\nTrainer, but I don’t need it now.\c\nYou use it and you build a new age.\c\nI’ll stay here and take care of the mortgage and\nthe old age.
33	You’re not one of the students, are you?\nWhat do you want from an old cleaning lady?
34	Are you the Vaporeon User?
35	It’s nothing...
36	...Well, yes, I suppose I am.\c\nWhat’s that? Kagetora sent you to battle me?\c\nI don’t mind. But no complaints out of you for\nhaving to take on this bent old woman!
37	Every rain cloud has its end...\nAnd no one can win against time’s march.\c\nNow I’m retired from training, and I spend my\ndays with Vaporeon cleaning these windows.\c\nBut how is that boy Kagetora doing?\nIs he well?
38	...Yes? What is it?\nDo you need something from me?
39	Are you the Flareon User?
40	It’s nothing...
41	Oh...\nAh...\c\nI see...\nSo you know Kagetora?\c\nYou would like a Pokémon battle from me?\nHow...nostalgic. It’s been quite some time.
42	A fire needs fuel to keep on burning.\nBut once the fuel is burnt up, only ash remains.\c\nMy working life is over. I’ve reached retirement.\nAll that is left of my life is the ashes.\c\nMe and Flareon are done with battling.\nI’d rather just go to lomi lomi and relax.
43	Ya-a-awn...\nThe old eyes are getting tired...
44	Are you the Jolteon User?
45	It’s nothing...
46	...Why, yes, I suppose I am. I’m Jane.\c\nEevee? Kagetora?\nI’m sorry, child. I don’t remember them...\c\nI do remember Pokémon battles, though...\nThough I’m not sure if I’m still up to one...
47	When lightning strikes the earth, it is swallowed\nup...and it disappears.\c\nEven if you try to whip an old body into action,\nthere are simply limits to what it can do.\c\nAnd besides...I really don’t remember anyone\ncalled Kagetora.
48	I suppose I should be moving...\nI’ll need to fix Espeon some supper...
49	Are you the Espeon User?
50	It’s nothing...
51	Why, that’s a question I haven’t heard in many\nlong years. I am Ishaan, if that’s what you mean.\c\nKagetora?\c\nOh! Oh yes! I remember that boy!\nNow that is a tale that takes me back...\c\nAnd you want to have a battle with me?\c\nI suppose I could, but please keep in mind\nthat I am an old man.
52	Even the sun itself, who rises with such glory\nin the morning, must eventually set.\c\nSo it is for human life, and I think...\nI think that I see the moon rising on the horizon.\c\nBut what about that Kagetora?\nHe’s not that much younger than me...\c\nDo tell him I said hello.
53	I suppose that’s enough for today...\c\nI’d better hurry home or that son of mine will\ngo berating me again for wandering off...
54	Are you the Umbreon User?
55	It’s nothing...
56	...That tale is decades old by now.\nHow old are you, [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl?\c\nWell, you’re not wrong.\nI was once known as Braiden the Umbreon User.\c\nAnd you know young Kagetora?\nHow is that little whippersnapper?\c\nSure, I don’t mind battling with you...\nThough I’m due to check in to the hospital soon.
57	No night can ever be endless.\nDawn comes and snatches away the dark.\c\nI feel that light creeping into my life, blotting\nout the stars and stealing away the night.\c\nPeople used to talk about me once.\nSaid I was immortal and such nonsense.\r\nI was just in the hospital a long while, that’s all.\r\nBut human life does end.\r\nAnyway...you give Kagetora my regards.
58	It’s about time for my appointment with\nthe beautician...
59	Are you the Leafeon User?
60	It’s nothing...
61	W-well...yes, I suppose I am.\nWho might you be, child?\c\nOh! A friend of sweet little Kagetora’s?\c\nOf course I’d be delighted to battle you!\nI still have some spirit left in me!
62	The flower that blooms will wilt and fall.\nThe stalk will wither and return to the earth.\c\nBut not for Leafeon and me!\nWe refuse to accept such a reality.\c\nI will do everything that money and medicine\ncan do to keep my looks!\c\nBut my bones can’t help telling the truth.\nAt any rate, do say hello to Kagetora for me.
63	When is that grandson of mine coming home?
64	Are you the Glaceon User?
65	It’s nothing...
66	Well... I am Rea, who used to always use\na Glaceon in battle.\c\nYou’re friends with that Kagetora?\c\nSure, I’ll battle you.\nI’ll get it over with in no time, don’t you worry.
67	Even the drifting snow will melt away.\c\nThe only thing I want out of life now is to spend\nas much time as I can with my grandchildren.\c\nYou tell Kagetora that’s my biggest worry now.\nI don’t want him sending more Trainers after me.
68	Then I’ve got to go and get Sylveon some snacks\nat the malasada shop...and...
69	Are you the Sylveon User?
70	It’s nothing...
71	...You’re looking for the Sylveon User Sakura?\nThat’s my grandma!\c\nAnd that Kagetora guy asked you to come\nvisit her?\c\nBut my grandma died last year, you know?\c\nOh, I know!\c\nHere, I keep Sylveon now, so how about I battle\nyou instead!
72	The sweetest part of life is when you’re cute.\nBut the sweetest part is also the shortest.\c\nThat’s what my grandma told me.\c\nMaybe you can tell that to your Mr. Kagetora\nor whomever!
73	Welcome to the Thrifty Megamart!\nThanks for choosing the Thrifty Megamart!\c\nHmm. You look like a Trainer, but I can tell that\nyou’re still just getting started.\c\nIf you can become the strongest Trainer in all\nAlola, why don’t you come talk to me again?
414
0	Lomi lomi is the style of massage we practice\nhere in Alola.\r\nHow about a treatment for your Pokémon?\r\nIt will make them feel more friendly toward you.\c\nWhat do you say? Can I do a little lomi lomi on\nthat [VAR 0101(0000)] you have there?
1	If you ever want to experience the joys of\nlomi lomi massage, just stop by our shop here.
2	Then allow me to just take [VAR 0101(0000)]\nthere for a moment...
3	[~ 3]
4	There we go!\c\nIt was a really productive session of lomi lomi.\nI think you’ll notice a lot of friendly feelings!
5	There we go!\c\nI think that lomi lomi session helped inspire\nsome good, friendly feelings toward you.
6	There we go!\c\nI think this session was a good start. It’s feeling\na bit more friendly toward you already, I’d say.
7	I can only manage one session of lomi lomi per\nday, but do feel free to come again tomorrow!
8	Do you want to know if your Pokémon feel\nfriendly toward you or not?
9	I understand. Sometimes knowing can be\nworse than not knowing.
10	Then I’ll have a look at your [VAR 0101(0001)]\nthere, shall I?
11	My! It feels incredibly close to you!\nNothing makes it happier than being with you!
12	You clearly love your [VAR 0101(0000)], and you\nmust spend a lot of time together.
13	Hm. I’d say that you and [VAR 0101(0000)] have\nthe potential to be an even greater combo.
14	Hmmm. I think...it feels friendly toward you.\nAt least a little...
15	Hmmm... I’d say that you and your Pokémon\nstill have a long way to go.
16	What is going on here? Do you let it get knocked\nout a lot in battles or something? This is bad.
17	Oh dear. You must be a merciless Trainer...\nDo you use Frustration or just not know better?
18	Oh tapu! How could you leave it like this?!\nTake it to a Pokémon Center right now!
19	You’re curious about an Egg?\nYou must want to meet whatever is inside soon!
415
0	This place here is a haven where children and\nPokémon can rest and be at peace.\c\nBut I’m in the middle of cleaning right now, so\nI’ll have to ask you to leave.
1	I know you. Thanks to your efforts, the shadow\nthat hung over the foundation has been lifted.\r\nThat’s what I’ve heard.
2	I would like to entrust you with a very precious\nPokémon, as both an apology and a show of\r\ngratitude on behalf of the foundation.
3	It looks like your Boxes are full, though.\nPlease make some space and come back again.
4	Porygon is a miracle born of science.\nA Pokémon with a digital brain.
5	Science exists to lead us to a brighter future.\c\nAnd I am here to protect those who will inherit\nthat future.
6	The Aether Foundation funds this facility.\c\nPeople and Pokémon can all live here, as equals\nand as family.
7	You’re [VAR 0100(0000)], aren’t you?\nI heard about you from Ms. Wicke.\c\nAs a member of the foundation, I’m grateful to\nyou...and I also feel I owe you some apology.\r\nHere. Please take this.
8	I believe that the foundation will change after...\nwell...all that ruckus that happened.\c\nWe will reflect on our errors and remake the\nfoundation as something even more than it was.\c\nWe will work hard to update and improve.
9	I can admit that I did wonder for a time about\nwhether I should quit the foundation.\c\nBut I want to keep protecting the smiles of the\nchildren and the Pokémon here.

1	[VAR 0109(0000)] [VAR BD03(0000)]$[VAR 0202(0001)]
2	Nothing
3	That’s right.\nYou don’t need anything more to carry now.
4	But you can’t carry any more!
5	But you don’t have enough money!
6	[VAR 1303(0000)][VAR 0109(0000)] came out!
7	Do you want to get one more?
8	What luck!\nAnother [VAR 0109(0000)] tumbled down!

417
0	Bwo! Bwo!\nBwooorrrrrr!
1	I wouldn’t tease that one.\nIf you do, he’ll buck and kick you.
2	Tauros are generally known as spirited Pokémon,\nbut this fellow is pretty feisty even for a Tauros.\c\nBut I guess it’s not that surprising, considering\nhow new he is to the ranch.
3	I’d like him to train to become a Ride Pokémon.\c\nBut I can’t even put him through his paces if\nhe bucks at every little thing like this.
4	I guess we’ll need the mistress’s skill for\nthis one!
5	The mistress?
6	Is that you?
7	The mistress of Paniola Ranch, of course!\nShe can get even the most unruly Tauros\r\nsnapped right into line!
8	Me? Ridiculous!\nHahahahah!\c\nYou think the mistress is some weak little girl?
9	Right then.\nIt’s time we call the mistress!
10	Here she is...the mistress of the ranch!\nMiltank!
11	Moooo moooo!
12	One roar from Miltank and even the most ornery\nTauros is instantly as quiet as a little Litten!
13	Mil moooooo!
14	Mooo!\nMo-mo mo moooooo!
15	Mroooowwwrrrr!
16	Mooooooooo!
17	Hff! Mooo!\nMooorrrrrrrrr!
18	Well, they do say the stronger the Tauros is,\nthe harder it is to control.\c\nLooks like even the mistress is having a tough\ntime with this one.
19	Maybe if he burns off a bit of excess energy,\nit’ll be a bit easier to bring him to heel...\c\nWhat do you think?\nHow about taking on Tauros in a battle?
20	Sure, I’ll battle
21	Maybe later...
22	Then don’t hold back!\nGo all out against this one!
23	Really? I thought it’d be a great help to us if\nyou could do it...
24	Looks like you worked up a fine sweat!\nI think Tauros feels pretty satisfied, too.
25	Bwoooooor!
26	Moooooo!\nMo-mo mooo!
27	Mo... Hff...
28	Even Tauros couldn’t stand up to the combined\npowers of the pair of you and Miltank!
29	Thanks, sweetie!\nJust what we expect of the ranch’s mistress!
30	Mil-mooooooooo!
31	Thanks to you, I think we can finally start on\nthis fellow’s Ride Pokémon training.\c\nI hope you’ll take this!
32	With Ride Pokémon, even people who aren’t\nPokémon Trainers can enjoy a convenient life.
33	Bwooorrr!
34	None of our Tauros dare slack off as long as the\nmistress is watching! Hah!
35	Mil-moooooo!

0	So...so...
1	Cooor!
2	This Pokémon seems to be hurt...\nWhat will you do?
3	Use a Potion on it
4	Take it to a Pokémon Center
5	Sorry, sorry, sorry!\nI know! I took way too long!\c\n...Huh?
6	I just left my Pokémon here to play for a little bit\nwhile I was shopping in town.\c\nI checked that there weren’t any Pokémon here\nthat would bully my Corsola but...\c\nBut there was a Mareanie hiding in the rocks!\nOooh! I want to fish it up and show it my wrath!
7	Mareanie love breaking off and eating Corsola’s\nbranches more than anything else in the world!\c\nThey hunt Corsola down mercilessly to gnaw\nand nibble on their branches!\c\nSure, the Corsola’s branches can regenerate\nand they’ll eventually grow back, but...\r\nThat doesn’t make it any less scary for Corsola!
8	You were worried about my Corsola and trying\nto help them, weren’t you?\c\nThank you. You’re a really nice Trainer.\c\nHere, take this from me.\nIt might come in handy.
9	Come on, let’s get you both all better.\nOff to the Pokémon Center!

4	Of course!
5	Uhhh...what?
6	Just what I would expect of a Champion!\nThat is very wise thinking.\c\nI’m a top-ranking player in the golf world, and\nthat is because I still practice every day.[VAR 0114(0019)]
7	You’re the Champion, aren’t you?\c\nI’m a top-ranking player in the golf world, and\nthat is because I still practice every day![VAR 0114(0019)]
8	I think it’s important to keep training every day,\neven if it’s for just a bit.\c\nI’ll give you this. It should help you aim for\neven loftier goals![VAR 0114(0019)]
9	Many Flying-type Pokémon are fast, right?\c\nThat’s why I use Trick Room to up my handicap.\c\nIt forces me to train in battles where the slower\nPokémon get to move first.[VAR 0114(0019)]
10	I should get going, though.\c\nI’ve got to get back to my daily training regimen.\nTen more hours to go today.[VAR 0114(0019)]

26	*munch munch munch*\nUgh! What is this?\c\nThe thick soup is sour, and the fish fillet is\nfull of little bones!\c\nThe patty is too moist and leaves sticky juices\ndripping down your chin...\c\nAnd whatever the mysterious grayish thing is\non the side, it doesn’t taste of anything...
27	It was delicious!
28	Ugh... It’s no good...\nYou can’t eat another bite...
29	Ah... That was delicious.\c\nMaybe it’s about time I find someone to cook for\nmyself, huh?\c\nOh! But look at your plate, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou’ve barely touched a thing!\c\nLocal flavors not your thing?[VAR 0114(0009)]

9	UB-04.

13	Beast Balls are incredibly valuable Poké Balls!\c\nI asked Madam Wicke, who works in the secret\nlabs, and she said a single ball costs millions!\c\nIt appears you still have some on you, as well.\nBe very careful about using them![VAR 0114(001F)]

19	Ah yes, the matter of the UBs.\c\nDisclosing info on this is prohibited, so let’s\nplease keep this between you and me.\c\nFirst, please take these.[VAR 0114(0016)]
20	The International Police asked me to pass them\nto you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
21	What are they?
22	Poké Balls?
23	Those are Beast Balls, which the Aether\nFoundation developed in great secrecy...\c\nThey are a special kind of Poké Ball that are\nspecialized for capturing Ultra Beasts.\c\nAs a result, they are very expensive to make, so\nwe have not been able to mass-produce them.\c\nPlease consider your timing very carefully for\nwhen you will use them during a battle.[VAR 0114(0016)]
24	The appearance of the UBs is something that\nwe at the foundation are to blame for...\c\nThat is why I will do whatever is within my\npower to assist you in this.\c\nFor now, perhaps you should return to Ms.\nAnabel at the motel in Akala.\c\nShe may have discovered new info.[VAR 0114(0016)]

27	What’s special about the UBs?
28	Show me the UB data
29	Nihilego
30	Buzzwole
31	Pheromosa
32	Xurkitree
33	Kartana
34	Celesteela
35	Guzzlord
36	Never mind
37	Ultra Beasts are life-forms from another world.\c\nIf you try to throw a regular Poké Ball at one,\nthe ball will have a difficult time recognizing the\r\ncreature as a Pokémon, and so the capturing\r\nfunction will be significantly impaired.\c\nBut these special balls should allow you to\ncapture beasts quite normally.\c\nThey could be considered the foundation’s\nnegative assets, but I hope they will help you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
38	The UBs surround themselves with an aura\ncalled the Beast Boost.\c\nThe truth of this aura is that it is the energy\nthat flows within the Ultra Wormhole.\c\nWhen the UBs pass through the Ultra Wormhole,\nthey are bathed in a great deal of this energy\r\nand likely store it within their bodies.[VAR 0114(0016)]
39	There are also Pokémon on our planet that\npossess this same kind of energy.\c\nI think you know what I mean.\c\nThe so-called Totem Pokémon that you faced in\nyour trials.\c\nThis is because the energy pours down upon\nour planet when the holes open.[VAR 0114(0016)]
40	Which Ultra Beast would you like to learn\nmore about?[VAR 0114(0016)]
41	UB-01. Code name: “Symbiont.”\nProperly known as Nihilego.\c\nThere have been sightings reported of this\nbeast in Alola’s past.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is its parasitic\ncapability.\c\nWhen Nihilego latches on to a host, it does not\nmanipulate its actions directly.\c\nRather it awakens the host’s own capabilities\nand boosts them to an extreme extent in order\r\nto protect itself.
42	It injects the host with a sort of neurotoxin to\nachieve this effect.\c\nThis neurotoxin of Nihilego’s is incredibly\nstimulating and inspires feelings of extreme\r\nexcitement and a lack of inhibition in its host.\c\nIn other words, anything or anyone that a\nNihilego latches on to will have its native skills\r\nforcibly activated to their fullest extent and will\r\nthen act as it naturally desires to.
43	UB-02. Code name: “Absorption.”\nProperly known as Buzzwole.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is its skill to\nstrengthen itself.\c\nBuzzwole is able to absorb energy and then\nachieve a chemical reaction between the energy\r\nit has absorbed and its own body fluids.
44	As a result, Buzzwole’s body swells to an\nalmost explosive extent.\c\nIts muscles bulge and are so thick and dense\nthat they are stronger even than steel.\c\nBoth its Attack and Defense experience a clear\nleap in power.\c\nIt also displays a habit of striking a pose each\ntime that it takes any sort of action...\c\nIt is thought this might serve as a method of\ncommunication, but it is not well understood.
45	UB-02. Code name: “Beauty.”\nProperly known as Pheromosa.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nThis UB can reach speeds exceeding 120 mph\nin just an instant.\c\nThis speed is greater than any other living\ncreature that has been discovered to date.\c\nBut its most distinctive features may in fact be\nits beauty and its powerful pheromones.
46	Most any creature that squares off against a\nPheromosa becomes confused, as if struck by\r\nthe beast’s beauty, and loses the will to fight.\c\nIt is still a subject of research, but it’s thought\nthat Pheromosa may possess some sort of\r\norgan able to produce a pheromonal substance\r\npreviously unknown to science.
47	UB-03. Code name: “Lighting.”\nProperly known as Xurkitree.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is an organ that\ncan generate power.\c\nThis UB’s bodily makeup is highly reminiscent\nof electric wiring, thus enabling it to conduct\r\nelectricity with great efficiency.
48	It can discharge as much as a million volts of\npower at a time.\c\nWhen it begins to run out of power, it stabs its\nlegs and tail into the soil, entering a treelike\r\nstate as it absorbs electricity from the ground.
49	UB-04. Code name: “Blade.”\nProperly known as Kartana.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is its thin and razor-\nsharp body, of which every edge has as cruel\r\na cutting edge as any well-honed blade.\c\nThe edges on its arms are particularly in a class\nof their own.
50	Any opponent who tries to attack it will be\ncut down with a single strike of its “blades.”\c\nIts thin body also allows it to evade attacks by\ndancing lightly out of the way.\c\nThis is a very dangerous creature, considering\nits excellent offensive and defensive\r\ncapabilities, but due to the nature of its body, it\r\nis also highly vulnerable to fire and moisture.
51	UB-04. Code name: “Blaster.”\nProperly known as Celesteela.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is the energy that\nit stores within itself, a flammable gas that it\r\ncan shoot from its two huge arms.
52	This is mostly used to propel itself in flight and\nfor battle, but it is thought to have sufficient\r\npower and lift to even fly into space.\c\nIts bodily construction closely resembles that of\na plant, and it absorbs nutrients from the soil.
53	UB-05. Code name: “Glutton.”\nProperly known as Guzzlord.\c\nThis UB has been sighted in the Alola region\nin the past as well, according to our reports.\c\nIt seems it was targeted by the International\nPolice in a top-secret mission at that time.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is its limitless\nappetite. It feeds without pause every moment\r\nthat it is awake.
54	It uses the two large tongues that protrude from\nits mouth to catch and devour everything in its\r\npath, be it organic or inorganic matter.\c\nAnd while it eats such an inordinate amount,\nGuzzlord excreta has never been discovered.\c\nIt is thought that it might fully convert the\nthings that it eats into energy for it to use.
55	Please...do be careful.[VAR 0114(0016)]
56	Hm? What is this Pokédex data,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\n...Necrozma.\c\nIt’s black, yet it’s refracting light...\c\nBut we haven’t had any word from HQ about\nsuch a UB.\c\nIt must be simply a rare Pokémon.\nStill, it’s quite remarkable, though![VAR 0114(001F)]

14	It is an honor to meet you, of course,\nthe first Champion of Alola.\c\nPlease forgive our rude summons.\c\nMy name is Anabel.\c\nI am the head of a secret division within the\nInternational Police. We are the UB Task Force.[VAR 0114(0030)]
15	Please forgive me for the most sudden question,\nbut I must ask...\c\nis it true that you encountered UB Symbiont?[VAR 0114(001F)]
16	UB?
17	Symbiont?
18	The UBs are the beasts...\notherwise known as Ultra Beasts.\c\nThey are unidentified life-forms that reside in\na different world from the one we live in.\c\nThat Nihilego creature you encountered was\none such beast.[VAR 0114(0029)]
19	Yes, UB-01...Symbiont.\nI suppose you knew it as Nihilego.\c\nThe International Police refers to all of the\nUBs by code names, like Symbiont there.\c\nI believe you might recognize it as the Pokémon\nthat the woman Lusamine fused with?[VAR 0114(0029)]
20	Now that we have cleared that up, please allow\nme to ask once more.\c\nDid you come in contact with Symbiont?\nThat is, with Nihilego?[VAR 0114(001F)]
21	I did
22	I beat it
23	Just as we had thought...[VAR 0114(0029)]
24	That seems to settle things, Chief.[VAR 0114(001F)]
25	Listen. Everything that we are about to share\nwith you is highly classified information.\c\nWe must ask that you keep all that you learn\nhere to yourself.\c\nThe incident that Ms. Lusamine caused...\nSymbiont wasn’t the only UB to appear from\r\nthe Ultra Wormhole that was temporarily\r\nopened at that time.[VAR 0114(0029)]
26	We have confirmed the presence of another\nSymbiont, other than the one you encountered.\r\nAnd we have received reports of sightings of\r\nseveral other types of UBs...\c\nThe UBs are dangerous beings whose powers\nexceed the boundaries and logic of our world.\c\nAnd they were dropped rudely into this world\nagainst their own will...\c\nWe can only expect that they will be extremely\nwary and combative.[VAR 0114(001F)]
27	And so we have been tasked with three duties.\c\nThe first is to investigate the ecology of these\nunidentified UBs.\c\nThe second is to look out for UBs and protect\nthe people from any harm.\c\nAnd the third is to either protect the UBs...\nor destroy them...[VAR 0114(0029)]
28	If the UBs are destructive beings that will seek\nsome sort of revenge upon our world, then the\r\norder from above is to erase them completely.[VAR 0114(001F)]
29	But neither myself nor Looker would like to see\nthat happen.\c\nEven if they are UBs, they are living creatures.\nWe would like to protect them and save them.[VAR 0114(0029)]
30	But protecting the UBs...\c\nit would seem to amount to catching them,\nand that is a more difficult task than simply\r\ndestroying them would be.\c\nWe do not currently have the battle power\nnecessary to achieve such a goal.[VAR 0114(001F)]
31	And so we finally arrive at the point.\nLet us dispense with any pretense...\c\nWe wish for you, the Champion of Alola, to\nlend us your assistance.[VAR 0114(0029)]
32	[VAR 0100(0000)]...\nwe want you to join our team.\c\nPlease give your aid to the UB Task Force.[VAR 0114(0029)]
33	Sure!
34	What?!
35	Please...\nWe want to save the UBs.\c\nBut to do that, we will need your strength...[VAR 0114(0029)]
36	You accept?\nThank you very much![VAR 0114(0029)]
37	So that means, Chief...[VAR 0114(001F)]
38	I know, Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0029)]
39	It is only a formality, but I still must test you\nto ensure that you can handle this job.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\nMay I ask you to join me in a battle?\c\nI will wait until you are ready, so do whatever\npreparations you need and then speak with me.[VAR 0114(0029)]
40	You will want to prepare quite well for this.\nMy boss is a very tough lady.[VAR 0114(001F)]
41	So you’re ready for me?\nLet’s begin then, shall we?\c\nLet me see your talent in its entirety.\nNo need to hold back.[VAR 0114(0029)]
42	Thank you...\nI believe the testing is complete.[VAR 0114(0029)]
43	I see no problem at all with your skills.\nRather I would have to praise you for them.[VAR 0114(0029)]
44	I hope that we will do fine work together.[VAR 0114(0029)]
45	So now you are a member of our team, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! You are most welcome!\c\nThen there is no time to be wasting.\nLet us begin your first job!\c\nThe chief and I will set out to gather more\ninformation about the UBs.\c\nWe want to ask you to visit the secret labs in\nthe bottom of Aether Paradise![VAR 0114(001F)]
46	There you should find our other partner in this\nendeavor. The vice-chief of the Alolan branch\r\nof the Aether Foundation: Ms. Wicke.[VAR 0114(0029)]
47	She will know why you’ve come.\c\nNow set forth, young [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(001F)]
48	The lower floors of Aether Paradise.\c\nThat is where you must go to find the secret\nlabs and to meet with Ms. Wicke.[VAR 0114(0029)]
49	Welcome back.[VAR 0114(0029)]
50	It would seem that you managed to meet with\nMs. Wicke.\c\nI also expect Mr. Looker will return shortly...[VAR 0114(0029)]
51	È un disastro![VAR 0114(001F)]
52	Is...something the matter, Mr. Looker?\nIf you spoke in English, I might understand.\c\nWhat has you so bothered?[VAR 0114(0029)]
53	I’m sorry! It is a terrible habit I picked up.\nBut we do have a disaster in the making!\c\nSightings are being reported of another UB-01!\nIt is Symbiont!\c\nAnd the perp has been right here in Akala,\nright under our very noses![VAR 0114(001F)]
54	I understand.[VAR 0114(0029)]
55	Then, Mr. Looker. M[VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]r.iss [VAR 0100(0000)].\nIt looks like we have a job to do.[VAR 0114(0029)]
56	My task will be to protect the populated areas.[VAR 0114(0029)]
57	[VAR 0100(0000)]...\nyou will go to where the sighting was reported.[VAR 0114(0029)]
58	Mr. Looker, you are to stay here and coordinate\nour backup, if we should need it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
59	I...I see...[VAR 0114(001F)]
60	Backup is a vital part of any operation,\nMr. Looker.\c\nWe are entrusting our safety to you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
61	Yes, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
62	Then I will be going ahead.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], stay safe![VAR 0114(0029)]
63	Good luck out there, Chief![VAR 0114(001F)]
64	Young [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nDo take care and keep yourself safe out there!\c\nIf you ever are in need of more information,\nyou may come talk with me![VAR 0114(001F)]
65	I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nWith this development, I think we will be able\nto solve the mysteries surrounding Nihilego.[VAR 0114(0029)]
66	Well! Regardless of all that, congratulations are\nin order, young [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI, the great Looker, think I shall provide a great\nfeast to celebrate your great success and\r\nyour addition to our team!\c\nThere are some rather tasty restaurants here\non this island, after all![VAR 0114(001F)]
67	Oh? But how would you know that, Mr. Looker?\c\nWe have only just arrived in Alola...[VAR 0114(0029)]
68	Urm! I read about them in a magazine they had\nat the local Pokémon Center!\c\nD-don’t you worry yourself about the details!\nI’ll go and ask if they don’t do delivery.[VAR 0114(001F)]
69	My goodness...\nThat Mr. Looker...[VAR 0114(0029)]
70	Oh yes.\nThere was one other thing I wanted to tell you.\c\nThe original plan was that the UB you caught\nwould be collected by the International Police.\c\nHowever, we have been able to secure official\npermission for you to keep it, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
71	It was a bit of a hassle to get all the details\nironed out, but...\c\nIf we take the UB to headquarters, it would\nend up as a research subject.[VAR 0114(0029)]
72	I expect it will be much happier staying with\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
73	C’est une catastrophe![VAR 0114(001F)]
74	M-Mr. Looker...\nYes? What is it this time?\r\nIn English, if you please.[VAR 0114(0029)]
75	I’m sorry! It is just a habit of mine!\nBut never mind that—we have a disaster!\c\nI got a tip about a new UB sighting!\c\nThis time the sighting was on Melemele Island.\nI’m sorry, but we’ll have to put off our feast![VAR 0114(001F)]
76	I understand.\c\nLet us hurry to Melemele Island at once.[VAR 0114(0029)]
77	Yes, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
78	I will go ahead to Melemele Island and set up a\nnew base of operations at the motel there.\c\nPlease join us there as soon as you’re ready,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
79	We make for Melemele at once!\nWe’re trusting in you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nDon’t forget: the Melemele motel is on Route 2![VAR 0114(001F)]
427
0	Oh? Looks like you’re a trial-goer, eh?\nI’ve got a favor to ask of you then.
1	I’d be happy to help
2	I’m too busy
3	...Oh. So that’s how it is, eh?\c\nNo time to listen to an old lady’s problems,\nis that right?
4	Route 10 here is long and wide, and it’s a great\nplace to let your Pokémon play a bit.\c\nMy Stufful hadn’t been getting much exercise\nlately, so I let them out of their balls to have\r\nthem run around a bit...\c\nBut they haven’t come back!\c\nI want to go look for them, but it’s hard for\nan old lady like me to traipse all around...
5	If you find one of my little Stufful, you just tell\nthem to come back to me.\c\nThey’re impish creatures, but smart as a cookie\nand with noses that could sniff out anything.\r\nThey’ll find their way back home to me.
6	Will you help me find my Stufful along\nRoute 10?
7	Sure
8	I’m too busy
9	I’ve got [VAR 0200(0000)] Stufful lost out there somewhere.\nMaybe they’re hiding?
10	...Oh, I see.\nSympathy is a real rare commodity these days.
11	*sniff sniff*
12	Grrrr!
13	The Stufful ran off in a hurry...
14	Hmm...\c\nWell, [VAR 0200(0001)] of them have come back so far...\c\nBut where [VAR 1101(0002,0D0B)]is the lastare the other [VAR 0200(0002)] still hiding?
15	Oh! You, child!\c\nAll of my Stufful have made it back, thanks\nto you!
16	You’ve been a great help to me here.\nI surely do owe you, my young friend.\c\nTake these from me, along with my thanks.
17	Cute and strong and just a little bit wild...\c\nThat’s what a Pokémon should be like!\nAnd that’s why Stufful is the best.
18	Glistening sweat! Slippery goo!\nThe perfect tune that keeps Hano Beach going!\r\nPyukumuku chuckers are desperately needed!\r\nWon’t you become a Pyukumuku chucker?
19	What’s that?
20	I’m too busy
21	Now that’s a shame!\nThe job pays pretty good, you know!
22	I’m one of the staff members responsible for\nkeeping Hano Beach spotless for our guests.\c\nBut Pyukumuku sometimes wriggle up on our\nbeach from the sea.\c\nI don’t know why they do it, but we can’t just\nleave them there.\c\nThey shrivel up on land and that’s not all...\nOur guests get grossed out seeing them and\r\nsometimes even get hurt stepping on them!
23	So we end up with no choice but to chuck\nthose poor Pyukumuku back into the sea!\c\nI’ll explain the job to you. It’s pretty easy.\c\nStep one! Catch Pyukumuku!\c\nStep two! Throw the Pyukumuku back into\nthe sea!\c\nStep three! Report back to me once every last\nPyukumuku on the beach is returned to the sea!
24	So what do you say? Think you’ve got what it\ntakes to be a Pyukumuku chucker?
25	Sure, I do
26	I’m too busy
27	Then get every last Pyukumuku on this beach\ndiving right back into the sea!\c\nLet’s see... I can still see [VAR 0200(0000)] Pyukumuku left on\nthe sand and in need of saving!
28	We really need some more hands to get this job\ntaken care of. Come back if you ever have time!
29	Puke?
30	Muke...
31	You chucked the Pyukumuku back into\nthe sea...
32	Hey there, part-timer!\c\nYou’ve gotten [VAR 0200(0001)] Pyukumuku safely back into\nthe sea so far.\c\nWhich means that you’ve still got [VAR 0200(0002)] more to\nreturn to the sea!
33	Good job, part-timer!\c\nYou’ve got every last Pyukumuku that was\nstranded on the beach back into the sea!\c\nNow they are safe back where they should be,\nand the beach is safe for our guests.
34	You’re a real good worker, you know?\nYou have a real knack for Pyukumuku chucking.\c\nAnd I’ve got your pay ready for you right here.\nTake it! You’ve earned it!
35	Pyukumuku are one of the most famous of all\nthe Alolan Pokémon.\c\nBut a lot of tourists from other regions don’t\nunderstand their appeal. It’s a real shame.
36	But no matter how many times we toss them\nback into the sea, they come wriggling back up\r\nthe next morning like clockwork.\c\nFeel free to come back and help again whenever\nyou have some spare time!
37	It looks like all of the Stufful have gone back\nto their Trainer...
38	It looks like all the Pyukumuku are gone from\nthe beach...
428
0	Thank you for joining us, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
1	Mr. Looker has already set out to gather more\ninformation about the UB.\c\nI have been waiting here on standby.\nI expect we will have another visitor soon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
2	A visitor?
3	Who?
4	A mysterious person who claims to have some\nknowledge of the UB.\c\nHe insisted that he would not share any more\ndetails with me until we met in person...\c\nBut if he does have any real insight into the UB,\nthen we cannot let this opportunity pass us by.[VAR 0114(0029)]
5	So I think it is best if you and I wait to take any\nfurther action now. And that we trust Mr. Looker\r\nto handle the fieldwork.\c\nThough I do feel bad asking him to do all the\nwork for us.[VAR 0114(0029)]
6	I must applaud Mr. Looker for that remarkable\nenergy of his.\c\nHe is in a class of his own, even within the\nelite members of the International Police...\c\nI would never have expected someone like him\nto serve under my command...[VAR 0114(0029)]
7	Don’t mind if I let myself in.[VAR 0114(0030)]
8	Y-you are...?[VAR 0114(0029)]
9	How you been doing? You’re well?[VAR 0114(000A)]
10	M-Mr. Nanu...\nMy, it really has been a long time...\c\nbut why in the world are you—?[VAR 0114(0029)]
11	I’m your contact.\nYou want to know about that monster, right?[VAR 0114(000A)]
12	Monster...\c\nSo you were the one who reached out to us?[VAR 0114(0029)]
13	I forgot about this kahuna meeting we were all\nsupposed to go to.\r\nThat’s how I ended up stuck as the messenger.[VAR 0114(000A)]
14	And here you are, boy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
15	And here you are, girl.[VAR 0114(000A)]
16	You’re acquainted with [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0029)]
17	Guess you could say that.[VAR 0114(000A)]
18	And...do you have some information for us about\nthe UB that has been sighted on the island?[VAR 0114(0029)]
19	It’s not like I’ve seen it or anything.\nJust heard rumors. You know.[VAR 0114(000A)]
20	Yes. So then...could I trouble you to tell us what\nit is that you do know?[VAR 0114(0029)]
21	What was it you guys were calling it?\nAbsorption or something?\c\nWell, you’ll find it in Melemele Meadow.\nNot just one of ’em either. Two of the suckers.[VAR 0114(000A)]
22	What was it you guys were calling it?\nBeauty or something?\c\nWell, you’ll find it in Verdant Cavern.\nNot just one of ’em either. Four of the things.[VAR 0114(000A)]
23	Wait... Wait just a moment!\c\nHow do you know our code names?\nThat is highly classified information![VAR 0114(0029)]
24	Hmph. No one wants to hear about that.\nGood luck.[VAR 0114(000A)]
25	Mr. Nanu was in fact a superior of mine when\nI first joined the International Police...\c\nI never dreamed that I would meet him once\nagain under circumstances such as these...[VAR 0114(0029)]
26	But if the information that he shared with us is\ncorrect, then there are multiple UBs this time.[VAR 0114(0029)]
27	The situation is dangerous.\nIf we don’t act at once...[VAR 0114(0029)]
28	¡Es un desastre![VAR 0114(001F)]
29	M-Mr. Looker...\nIn English, if you would...[VAR 0114(0029)]
30	I’m sorry! But please!\nThis is no time to care about my odd habits!\c\nThe UB sightings! I’ve gotten a hot tip!\c\nThe perp really is right here on Melemele![VAR 0114(001F)]
31	It appears that it might be UB Absorption!\c\nIt seems to be a UB of great strength and\nformidable muscles!\c\nBut that is not all...\nIt is not one creature, but two!\r\nIn Melemele Meadow![VAR 0114(001F)]
32	It appears that it might be UB Beauty!\c\nIt seems to be a beautiful yet dangerous UB\nthat can move at incredible speeds!\c\nBut that is not all...\nIt is not one specimen, but four!\r\nIn Verdant Cavern![VAR 0114(001F)]
33	So it appears that his information was correct...[VAR 0114(0029)]
34	Hm? What’s that?\nDid you say something just now, Chief?[VAR 0114(001F)]
35	No... It’s nothing.\c\nI understand, Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0029)]
36	Then, Mr. Looker. M[VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]r.iss [VAR 0100(0000)].\nIt looks like we have a job to do.[VAR 0114(0029)]
37	My task will be to protect the populated areas.[VAR 0114(0029)]
38	[VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou will go to where the sighting was reported.[VAR 0114(0029)]
39	Mr. Looker, you are to stay here and act as our\nbackup once again, in case we should need it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
40	Hold it right there!\nNot again! This time I insist that I...[VAR 0114(001F)]
41	Please understand, Mr. Looker.\c\nYou do not have a partner Pokémon with you.\c\nI cannot allow you to operate in a place where\nyou are likely to encounter danger![VAR 0114(0029)]
42	And besides that...having such an experienced\nveteran as yourself serve as our backup is a\r\nvital task in an operation like this one.[VAR 0114(0029)]
43	Understood, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
44	Then I must be off.\n[VAR 0100(0000)], I wish you fortune in battle![VAR 0114(0029)]
45	Good luck out there, Chief![VAR 0114(001F)]
46	You take these, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI received them from Madam Wicke.[VAR 0114(001F)]
47	I trust that you will be careful out there, my\nyoung [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nAnd one last thing before you go...\c\nMadam Wicke finished analyzing all of the data\nthat we gathered on Nihilego, AKA UB Symbiont.\c\nIf you wish to learn more about that creature,\nyou should speak with Madam Wicke in the\r\nAether Paradise secret labs!\c\nNow it is time we get to work.\nAnd I’m here if you need to ask me anything![VAR 0114(001F)]
48	I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
49	With this data, I think we will be able to solve\nthe mysteries regarding UB Absorption...\r\notherwise known as Buzzwole.[VAR 0114(0029)]
50	With this data, I think we will be able to solve\nthe mysteries regarding UB Beauty...\r\notherwise known as Pheromosa.[VAR 0114(0029)]
51	Ugh...[VAR 0114(0029)]
52	What’s the matter, Chief?![VAR 0114(001F)]
53	I’m fine... I’m fine.\c\nThere were just so many of them this time that\nI was nearly run off my feet...[VAR 0114(0029)]
54	... ...[VAR 0114(001F)]
55	What? I’m fine, really!\nPlease don’t stare at me like that![VAR 0114(0029)]
56	Y-yes. Of course, ma’am.[VAR 0114(001F)]
57	You two must also be tired.\nWhat shall we do now?[VAR 0114(0029)]
58	If you are terribly exhausted, there is only one\nnatural conclusion to make...[VAR 0114(001F)]
59	The one thing that takes away all weariness!\nIt is, of course, a feast!\c\nThis time, indeed, we must have a great feast\nto celebrate our successful mission!\c\nAnd there is a restaurant here on this island\nwhere we can eat to our stomach’s content!\r\nI speak of course of the Battle Buffet![VAR 0114(001F)]
60	Oh? How curious. How is it that you are once\nagain so familiar with the local restaurants?[VAR 0114(0029)]
61	... ...\c\nI-it’s just by chance! The chanciest of chances!\nNot the Chansey-est, mind you. Just chance!\c\nN-never you mind that! The most important fact\nright now is that it is a very popular place!\r\nI will go at once to make a reservation![VAR 0114(001F)]
62	Mr. Looker is simply hopeless, isn’t he?[VAR 0114(0029)]
63	And Mr. Nanu...\c\nhe was an excellent police officer years ago.\c\nHe was on par with Mr. Looker even...back then.\c\nI’m really only here in this position now because\nof him...[VAR 0114(0029)]
64	Es ist ein Desaster![VAR 0114(001F)]
65	Oh? Mr. Looker?\nBack so soon again?[VAR 0114(0029)]
66	Could it be...[VAR 0114(0029)]
67	Yes, it could indeed! In fact it is, Chief!\c\nI’ve gotten a tip about another UB sighting!\c\nThis time it is on Akala Island!\nWe must delay our feast once again![VAR 0114(001F)]
68	Roger that, Mr. Looker.\c\nThen we must hurry to Akala Island at once.[VAR 0114(0029)]
69	Yes, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
70	We will return to the motel that we formerly\nused as our base of operations on Akala.\c\nI hope you will join us there as soon as you are\nready, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
71	Back to Akala!\nWe are still counting on you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nThe motel on Akala’s Route 8!\nThat is the place you must come![VAR 0114(001F)]
429
0	Oh! Here you are at last, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(001F)]
1	I’ve already been able to gather all of the intel\nwe need about the UBs this time.\c\nSo the chief has already left to help secure the\nsite and protect the surrounding areas.[VAR 0114(001F)]
2	Hallo![VAR 0114(0012)]
3	This precocious young lady here was my\ninformant this time![VAR 0114(001F)]
4	They sent me here on an errand.\nSince I’m not busy doing trials or anything.[VAR 0114(0012)]
5	Hmm?\nWho is that?[VAR 0114(001F)]
6	It’s a secret.\c\nOh, and I had one more order I was given.\nOr was it a request? Either way...[VAR 0114(0012)]
7	What might that be?[VAR 0114(001F)]
8	I was told I should have a real serious battle\nwith [VAR 0100(0000)] before I came back.\c\nI don’t really know why, but it seems like maybe\nit’s some sort of trial of strength.[VAR 0114(0012)]
9	So come on! Let’s have a battle!\nHave a Pokémon battle against me![VAR 0114(0012)]
10	Sure
11	Hold on
12	Shocking! You want me to wait?\nFine then. I guess I can wait.[VAR 0114(0012)]
13	Is that precocious young miss powerful?[VAR 0114(001F)]
14	All right!\nThen let’s get going already!\c\nTime for Mina to show you her full power!\nWe’ll get our Z on![VAR 0114(0012)]
15	Whoa, you’re surprisingly strong!\c\nThen it’s no problem.\nTurns out, you’re strong enough,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
16	It seems that my precocious young miss here is\nnot to be trifled with either...[VAR 0114(001F)]
17	OK, I’m out of here![VAR 0114(0012)]
18	She is rather odd, isn’t she?\nA real individual spirit...[VAR 0114(001F)]
19	But now we should get our heads on straight\nand get to work!\c\nI do not like it, but I am in charge of backup\nonce again![VAR 0114(001F)]
20	And for you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThe Beast Balls you will need for this mission![VAR 0114(001F)]
21	First, the regular reports, let us get them out of\nthe way, my young friend...\c\nMadam Wicke finished analyzing all of the data\nthat we gathered on the last UB you caught.\c\nIf you wish to learn more about that creature,\nyou should speak with Madam Wicke in the\r\nAether Paradise secret labs!\c\nAnd now it is time we get to work.\nIf you need to ask me anything, I am here![VAR 0114(001F)]
22	I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nWe should unravel the mysteries of Xurkitree,\nalso known as UB Lighting.[VAR 0114(0029)]
23	Ngh...[VAR 0114(0029)]
24	Are you all right, ma’am?![VAR 0114(001F)]
25	Y...yes...\nI’m fine, Mr. Looker.\c\nI just felt a passing vertigo...but I’m fine.\nPlease do not worry yourself.[VAR 0114(0029)]
26	But I must! I insist on worrying!\c\nYou have always had the stamina of a\nMachamp, Chief! I cannot believe this is nothing![VAR 0114(001F)]
27	No, please... It is nothing so serious...\c\nI’m sorry for causing you to worry about me.\nI insist that I really am fine...[VAR 0114(0029)]
28	Putting all that aside, I must say that we have\nfound a great ally in [VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nWhat a fantastic Trainer...\c\nIt was all that I could do to simply keep that\nXurkitree away from the town...[VAR 0114(0029)]
29	The UBs seem to get terribly aggressive when\nthey spot me...\c\nIt’s like they are treating me as prey or an\nenemy...[VAR 0114(0029)]
30	I...I am sure it is only your imagination, Chief!\nYou must be exhausted![VAR 0114(001F)]
31	[~ 31]
32	[~ 32]
33	...I let myself in.[VAR 0114(000A)]
34	Mr. Nanu...[VAR 0114(0029)]
35	You been keeping well?[VAR 0114(000A)]
36	Y-y-you are...[VAR 0114(001F)]
37	Heh. So it’s you, 100kr.\nOr...\r\nSorry. What is it now? “Looker”?[VAR 0114(000A)]
38	...Yes. It is.[VAR 0114(001F)]
39	What’s this? No smile for me?\c\nHere I am, coming out of my way to bring you\nthe info about the UB that you’re searching for.[VAR 0114(000A)]
40	Are you really?[VAR 0114(0029)]
41	That monster you’re calling Blade...\nIt’s on Ula’ula Island.\c\nI’ll tell you more when you get there.[VAR 0114(000A)]
42	That monster you’re calling Blaster...\nIt’s on Ula’ula Island.\c\nI’ll tell you more when you get there.[VAR 0114(000A)]
43	And your information...\nIt is all true?[VAR 0114(001F)]
44	I’m the kahuna of Ula’ula Island.\c\nIf you don’t do something about that monster\nfor me, our guardian’s not gonna be happy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
45	Thank you...for the information, Mr. Nanu.[VAR 0114(0029)]
46	See you around then.[VAR 0114(000A)]
47	... ...[VAR 0114(001F)]
48	Mr. Looker?[VAR 0114(0029)]
49	Yes...yes, ma’am?[VAR 0114(001F)]
50	Mr. Looker... Do I take it that you are acquainted\nwith Mr. Nanu?[VAR 0114(0029)]
51	I knew him once. I thought.[VAR 0114(001F)]
52	Never mind that...\nRight now we need to focus on our mission.[VAR 0114(001F)]
53	Of course... Yes, of course you’re right.\c\nIf we have reports of a new UB sighting, then\nour mission is our first priority...[VAR 0114(0029)]
54	I will move to Ula’ula island and prepare our\nnew base in the motel there.\c\nPlease join us there as soon as you are ready,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
55	I will go to Ula’ula...\nI trust that you will, as well, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nThe motel on Ula’ula Island is on Route 13...[VAR 0114(001F)]
430
0	[VAR 0100(0000)].\nThank you once again for coming.[VAR 0114(0029)]
1	I’ve been waiting for you...[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(001F)]
2	Once again we have already gathered the intel\non the UB we are targeting.\c\nMr. Nanu provided us with everything that we\nneeded to know.[VAR 0114(0029)]
3	The UB that has been sighted on this island is\nknown by the code name Blade...\c\nIt is a fearsome beast that is apparently able\nto cut through anything at all...\c\nAnd it was not a single sighting, either...[VAR 0114(001F)]
4	The UB that has been sighted on this island is\nknown by the code name Blaster...\c\nIt is a fearsome beast that apparently\npossesses a fearsome energy that will\r\nburn anything...\c\nAnd it was not a single sighting, either...[VAR 0114(001F)]
5	We cannot afford any delays.[VAR 0114(0029)]
6	I will protect the populated areas as usual.[VAR 0114(0029)]
7	[VAR 0100(0000)] will go to the site.[VAR 0114(0029)]
8	Mr. Looker, you will stand by.\nWe will ask you to handle backup.[VAR 0114(0029)]
9	Ngh![VAR 0114(0029)]
10	Are you all right, Chief?\nI think you are pushing yourself too far...[VAR 0114(001F)]
11	If you would agree, I would be happy to go into\nthe field myself this time and...[VAR 0114(001F)]
12	I’m fine!\nI can still handle this!\c\nI have you to watch my back after all, don’t I?[VAR 0114(0029)]
13	...Yes, ma’am.[VAR 0114(001F)]
14	Then I will be off now.\n[VAR 0100(0000)], I wish you fortune in battle![VAR 0114(0029)]
15	Do not push yourself too hard, Chief.\nPlease...be careful.[VAR 0114(001F)]
16	[VAR 0100(0000)], these are for you.\nYour Poké Balls known as Beast Balls for\r\nthis mission![VAR 0114(001F)]
17	First, the regular reports, let us get them out of\nthe way, my young friend...\c\nMadam Wicke finished analyzing all of the data\nthat we gathered on the last UB you caught.\c\nIf you wish to learn more about that creature,\nyou should speak with Madam Wicke in the\r\nAether Paradise secret labs!\c\nAnd now it is time we get to work.\nIf you need to ask me anything, I am here![VAR 0114(001F)]
18	I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
19	We should learn everything there is to know\nabout Kartana, also known as UB Blade.[VAR 0114(0029)]
20	We should learn everything there is to know\nabout Celesteela, also known as UB Blaster.[VAR 0114(0029)]
21	And...we have also had word from HQ.\c\nThere is only one UB left for us to take care of.[VAR 0114(0029)]
22	And we had our hands full with so many\nindividuals for this last UB...\c\nIt was a rather dangerous situation.\nBut you were all right, Chief?[VAR 0114(001F)]
23	Yes, of course!\nBoth me and my Pokémon were fine!\c\nOf course we ran into some difficult situations...\nBeing surrounded by the UBs and outflanked by\r\nthem made it rather touch and go for a while...[VAR 0114(0029)]
24	As I’d feared...[VAR 0114(001F)]
25	What is it, Mr. Looker?\c\nYou have been acting rather odd for a while\nnow, haven’t you?[VAR 0114(0029)]
26	Ah... No... It’s nothing.[VAR 0114(001F)]
27	Could it be...\c\nCould it be about our long-delayed feast?[VAR 0114(0029)]
28	Oh...\c\nYes! Yes, indeed! What a disaster that you\nhave found me out!\c\nThe truth is that I am starving, just starving!\nHow a Snorlax feels, I know exactly now![VAR 0114(001F)]
29	Hee... How hopeless you are, Mr. Looker.\c\nBut I suppose we have been putting it off for\nrather a long time. You must be hungry indeed.\c\nThen allow me to take point this time and find\na delicious restaurant for us all. ♪[VAR 0114(0029)]
30	Ah... Yes, ma’am! Thank you, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
31	It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, but I’m actually\nquite famished myself!\c\nSo you two stay here and relax while I go and\nfind us a place to eat![VAR 0114(0029)]
32	The chief can’t take much more of this...\nShe must be exhausted.\c\nShe acts particularly cheery when she is feeling\nunwell to hide her weakness from others.[VAR 0114(001F)]
33	I know it may be a bit late for this...\nBut there is something I would like to tell you.[VAR 0114(001F)]
34	It is something that happened about 10 years\nago now...\c\nI came to the Alola region at that time as part of\na three-person team to eradicate a UB...[VAR 0114(001F)]
35	Of course we did not know them as UBs back\nthen. It was simply a dangerous creature.\c\nMy team succeeded in chasing down the UB.\nAnd then we tried to put an end to it...[VAR 0114(001F)]
36	But somebody screwed up.[VAR 0114(0030)]
37	Nanu...[VAR 0114(001F)]
38	This halfhearted fool here felt sorry for the\nmonster, even if only for a moment.\c\nThat moment was enough to get the third\nmember of our team done in by the UB.[VAR 0114(000A)]
39	This I cannot deny...\nI made an error of judgment.\c\nI failed to consider the fact that she was not\ntrained for combat...[VAR 0114(001F)]
40	She was just bait for the UB...[VAR 0114(000A)]
41	And the International Police knew it...\c\nThe UBs relentlessly seek out those who have\npassed through an Ultra Wormhole.\c\nThe passage must change them somehow...as\nthough they’ve been bathed in some energy...\r\nSomething that the beasts can smell or sense...\c\nIt is thought that the UBs can track such\npeople as though sniffing them out.[VAR 0114(001F)]
42	It’s not like the monsters come here by choice.\nThey don’t want to be here.\c\nSo they smell that familiar scent and think\nthere’ll be a wormhole. That they’ll get home.[VAR 0114(000A)]
43	Nanu, you called her bait...\nShe really was, wasn’t she?[VAR 0114(001F)]
44	Faller...[VAR 0114(000A)]
45	That is what the International Police calls them.\nHumans who appear from an Ultra Wormhole...\c\nand those who are bathed in a great deal of\nthe energy that pours out from them.\c\nShe had come through a wormhole.\nShe was from another world.\c\nAnd she was put on our team to help draw\nthe UB to us...[VAR 0114(001F)]
46	And now you’re repeating history.\c\nYou’ve got a Faller right here, haven’t you?\nThat’s right, boy. I’m talking about you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
47	And now you’re repeating history.\c\nYou’ve got a Faller right here, haven’t you?\nThat’s right, girl. I’m talking about you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
48	Yes...\nIt’s true. [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe passed through an Ultra Wormhole.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)] was exposed to the energy,\nso [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she may indeed be a Faller.\c\nBut...[VAR 0114(001F)]
49	I’m back...[VAR 0114(0029)]
50	I’m sorry, young [VAR 0100(0000)].\nBut let us continue this talk another time.[VAR 0114(001F)]
51	I’m sorry, you two...\nI couldn’t get a reservation at the restaurant...\c\nIt seems like it’s a very popular place...[VAR 0114(0029)]
52	Hey, missy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
53	Mr. Nanu...\nI didn’t realize you were here.[VAR 0114(0029)]
54	Another one of those monsters appeared.\nThis time on Poni Island.\c\nI’ll tell you more when you get there. We’ll meet\nat the floating restaurant in Seafolk Village.[VAR 0114(000A)]
55	This next one seems like a real tough opponent.\nBe sure you’re ready for it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
56	O-oh... Yes, of course we will.\nThank you again, Mr. Nanu.[VAR 0114(0029)]
57	... ... ...[VAR 0114(001F)]
58	Um...Mr. Looker?\nIs everything all right?[VAR 0114(0029)]
59	Of course... It is fine...\nNot a problem at all...[VAR 0114(001F)]
60	Then I will make my way to the floating\nrestaurant at Poni Island.\c\nOnce you are ready, [VAR 0100(0000)], please do\ncome and join us there.[VAR 0114(0029)]
61	So it is on to Poni next...\nI will be counting on you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nLet us meet again at the floating restaurant in\nSeafolk Village...[VAR 0114(001F)]
431
0	So you came...young [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(001F)]
1	The chief has already left to set up protection\naround the populated areas...[VAR 0114(001F)]
2	You sent her off to the wrong location?[VAR 0114(000A)]
3	What choice did I have?\nShe is reaching her limit.\c\nWe have to force her to stand by to regain\nher strength...[VAR 0114(001F)]
4	So now we can finish our little talk.\nYou’ve got one Faller right here...[VAR 0114(000A)]
5	and the other one is Anabel.\nThough I don’t think she knows it herself.[VAR 0114(000A)]
6	Nanu and I, we found her here ten years ago, \nunconscious on the shore of this very island.\c\nWe’d just finished our mission here.[VAR 0114(001F)]
7	... ...[VAR 0114(000A)]
8	She had lost most of her memories, but four\nthings she could tell us.\c\nThat her name was Anabel...\nThat she came from the Hoenn region...\r\nThat she had protected some tower there...\r\nAnd that she was a powerful Trainer...[VAR 0114(001F)]
9	Then she was placed under observation by\nthe International Police.\c\nAll because they detected an insane amount of\nUltra Wormhole energy from her.[VAR 0114(000A)]
10	It may be that she was wandering lost in the\nwormhole for some time...\c\nRegardless of that, she then entered the\nInternational Police herself.[VAR 0114(001F)]
11	And then got promoted right up past you, her\nsenior, is that it?[VAR 0114(000A)]
12	Gotta hand it to the International Police.\nThey really are terrible.\c\nUsing the same strategy and setting up another\nFaller, even though the same thing failed before.[VAR 0114(000A)]
13	Your assumptions, you are half right in.\c\nHowever...this mission, she chose herself.[VAR 0114(001F)]
14	... ...[VAR 0114(000A)]
15	Perhaps something in her laments, whether she\nis conscious of it or not...\c\nPerhaps she feels some grief over the fate of\nthe UB, which came to this world just as\r\nshe did.[VAR 0114(001F)]
16	But she is still a Faller.\nIt is her fate to be targeted by the UBs.\c\nWith a Faller right before them, the UBs will run\nwild with excitement.\c\nNo matter how good she might be, everyone\nhas their limits.\c\nThat is why I had hoped to distract the UBs—\nto divert some of their attention.[VAR 0114(001F)]
17	That is why I asked you to help with the\ncatching of the UBs...[VAR 0114(001F)]
18	But you’re out of luck now.\c\nWith Anabel in that condition...\nShe’ll be done for if she runs into any UBs now.[VAR 0114(000A)]
19	Hm...\c\nYes, and I imagine that the false lead I sent her\nout on will not buy us much more time...[VAR 0114(001F)]
20	But before we’re out of time, boy...[VAR 0114(000A)]
21	But before we’re out of time, girl...[VAR 0114(000A)]
22	How about a battle with me?[VAR 0114(000A)]
23	No problem
24	Why?
25	Why not?\c\nIf you’ve got some preparation you need to do,\nthen I’ll wait here for you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
26	Maybe you already know this, but that guy is a\nreal tough opponent when he’s being serious.[VAR 0114(001F)]
27	What a good little boy you are...[VAR 0114(000A)]
28	What a good little girl you are...[VAR 0114(000A)]
29	Then let’s go.[VAR 0114(000A)]
30	That’ll do, [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl.\nI think that’ll do fine.[VAR 0114(000A)]
31	Don’t let me down.[VAR 0114(000A)]
32	I won’t...000.[VAR 0114(001F)]
33	Well then, young [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nIt is our time to get down to work, is it not?\c\nOur final UB. Code name: Glutton...\c\nNanu said he would lead it deep into the heart\nof Resolution Cave...[VAR 0114(001F)]
34	Here you are. As usual.[VAR 0114(001F)]
35	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThis is your final assignment!\c\nBut first, my young friend...let us get the regular\nreports out of the way.\c\nMadam Wicke finished analyzing all of the data\nthat we gathered on the last UB you caught.\c\nIf you wish to learn more about that creature,\nthen you should speak with Madam Wicke in\r\nthe Aether Paradise secret labs!\c\nAnd now it is time we get to work.\nIf you need to ask me anything, I am here![VAR 0114(001F)]
36	I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nNow we will be able to learn all there is to know\nabout Guzzlord, otherwise known as UB Glutton.[VAR 0114(0029)]
37	We’ve done it, Chief.[VAR 0114(001F)]
38	Yes...\c\nwe have successfully contained all of the UBs.[VAR 0114(0029)]
39	Thank you so much for all of your hard work\non these missions, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0029)]
40	And Mr. Looker...[VAR 0114(0029)]
41	Not at all!\nAll I did was provide backup to the two of you.[VAR 0114(001F)]
42	It was all you and [VAR 0100(0000)], Chief.[VAR 0114(001F)]
43	And now that we have finally completed our\nmissions, I will treat us all to a feast of—[VAR 0114(001F)]
44	One moment please.[VAR 0114(0029)]
45	Wh-what is it, Chief?\c\nWe have finally reached it—our grand finale!\nWhich we should end with a big feast...[VAR 0114(001F)]
46	Our truly final mission requires that we go to\nAether Paradise and report to Ms. Wicke that\r\nwe have contained all of the UBs.[VAR 0114(0029)]
47	Oh! Indeed you are right!\nAnd we must thank her for the Poké Balls\r\nknown as Beast Balls![VAR 0114(001F)]
48	We will be going to Aether Paradise to report to\nMs. Wicke about our success.\c\nIf you are free, why don’t you come along as\nwell, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0029)]
49	We make for the secret labs in the lower floor\nof Aether Paradise!\c\nWhy don’t you join us, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(001F)]
432
0	We have been waiting for you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0016)]
1	[VAR 0100(0000)], thank you for coming.[VAR 0114(0029)]
2	I’d like to thank you first for all of your hard\nwork containing the UBs.\c\nOn behalf of the entire foundation, I would like\nto offer you our most sincere thanks.\c\nWith this, all the UBs that appeared from the\nUltra Wormhole, which opened in the earlier\r\nincident, have been caught.[VAR 0114(0016)]
3	Oh no, we’re the ones who should be thanking\nyou, I think...\c\nWe could not have done it without the use of\nthe Beast Balls that you provided for us.[VAR 0114(0029)]
4	They are negative assets of the foundation...\nI am happy to see them put to some good use.\r\nI hardly know how I can thank the two of you...[VAR 0114(0016)]
5	The three of us
6	Don’t forget Looker
7	Yes, Mr. Looker also did a great deal to help us\nwith this mission.[VAR 0114(0029)]
8	But I thought that he left before us.\nWhat is taking him so long to get here?\c\nI know that I told him that we would meet here.\nCould something have happened?[VAR 0114(0029)]
9	Taihen da![VAR 0114(001F)]
10	R-really, Mr. Looker!\nEven after all this time...[VAR 0114(0029)]
11	I’m sorry!\nI know it’s a terrible habit, but I can’t help it!\r\nAnd more importantly...it’s a disaster![VAR 0114(001F)]
12	I would imagine it must be.\nWhat happened that made you so late?[VAR 0114(0029)]
13	I was on the way here when I stopped by\nMelemele Island to get some of their famous\r\nand delicious malasada as a gift for you all...[VAR 0114(001F)]
14	But just when I had finished my purchase,\nI chanced to look up at the sky and there...[VAR 0114(001F)]
15	there it was![VAR 0114(001F)]
16	A mysterious black...something was zipping\nacross the bright blue sky over Alola![VAR 0114(001F)]
17	It was black and yet it was shining somehow!\nIt was...it was like it was refracting light![VAR 0114(001F)]
18	It might have been a UB!\nNo, I’m certain of it! It surely was a UB![VAR 0114(001F)]
19	But it couldn’t be...\nWe haven’t had any word from HQ about there\r\nbeing more UBs![VAR 0114(0029)]
20	Please rest easy.\nI do not think it was a UB.\c\nWe have a hundred of our foundation members\nworking in parallel with the International Police\r\ninvestigation and scouring Alola for UBs.\c\nWe have not detected any UBs other than\nthe ones that you already contained for us.[VAR 0114(0016)]
21	So you see?\nWe should be quite safe now.[VAR 0114(0029)]
22	I...I suppose...\c\nPerhaps I was just dazzled by the brilliant,\nshining sky that stretches over Alola...[VAR 0114(001F)]
23	And it is little wonder if you were dazzled.\nYou all have been working so very hard.\c\nYou must be very tired, Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0016)]
24	W-well...yes, I suppose I could do with a nice\nlittle break...[VAR 0114(001F)]
25	And now you can have it.\c\nI received a message from HQ saying that our\npaid leave has been approved.[VAR 0114(0029)]
26	Paid leave?! You mean...actual vacation time?![VAR 0114(001F)]
27	They say we are free to do whatever we would\nlike until we get our next orders from HQ.\c\nI hope you will also use this chance to relax\nfor a little while, Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0029)]
28	I think that I will stay here and have a good\nlook around the Alola region.\c\nNot for work this time, but just as a regular\ntourist doing some sightseeing.[VAR 0114(0029)]
29	Then I think that I will go and eat my fill of\ndelicious Alolan cooking!\c\nThere are simply too many restaurants and\neateries that I wish to visit!\c\nAnd the traditional dishes at Sushi High Roller\nare absolutely sublime![VAR 0114(001F)]
30	Sushi...High Roller?[VAR 0114(0029)]

32	What’s this?! A date?![VAR 0114(001F)]
33	N-no! Not a date!\nI am meeting with Mr. Nanu!\c\nWe owe him quite a bit for all his help![VAR 0114(0029)]
34	Yes...I suppose we do.[VAR 0114(001F)]
35	So if you will excuse me...\n[VAR 0100(0000)], everyone...\r\nI’m afraid I must be going.[VAR 0114(0029)]

37	Yes, my young [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI also owe you my thanks.\c\nIt was because of your efforts that we were\nable to keep the chief safe until the end.\c\nThe folks at HQ thought that you needed to be\npaid for your work, so they sent this. Take it.[VAR 0114(001F)]
38	And now...I think that it’s time I went.\c\nI’ll be staying at the motel on Melemele Island,\nthough, so feel free to stop by anytime.[VAR 0114(001F)]

1	Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm!
2	I know! Look at you!\nYou look like a Pokémon Trainer with sense!
3	I’ve got something I’d like to ask a promising-\nlooking Trainer like you!
4	What do you say?
5	I’m listening
6	I’d rather not...
7	Hmm... Hrmmmmmmm...\nWell, that is a real shame...
8	Oh! Oh, thank you!\nThat’s wonderfully kind of you!
9	You see, I’m here doing some research on\nvarious Pokémon.\c\nI need to record the differences between 10\nspecies of Pokémon for my survey sample,\r\nbut I’ve been working so hard and my back is\r\njust killing me...
10	But then you came along!\c\nYou look like a sensible young Trainer, which\nis just the sort of person I need to help me!\c\nI’d like to ask you to catch 10 different species\nof Pokémon for me.\r\nIt’s not too much to ask, right?
11	Oh! But—! Oh, look at you! Already?!\c\nYou’ve already caught more than 10 species of\nPokémon! Then show me!
12	Oh, yes. This is perfect!\c\nThis is all the data that I needed. Thank you!
13	Here. Why don’t you take this?\nAs a little thank-you for helping me out.
14	I’m really grateful for your assistance, my\nsensible young Trainer!\c\nI look forward to seeing what a promising young\ngo-getter like yourself gets up to!
15	Good luck out there!
16	I want you to catch 10 different species of\nPokémon for me.\r\nAny kind that you like. Just 10 different ones!

4	Then allow me to inform you![VAR 0114(002B)]
5	Genesect is a Pokémon that lived 300 million\nyears ago.\c\nThen an organization called Team Plasma\nmodified it, attaching a cannon to its back.[VAR 0114(002B)]
6	The cannon’s abilities could be activated using\ncertain drives created by the scientists in the\r\nP2 Laboratory.\c\nI think that you might be able to use them as\nthey should be used.[VAR 0114(002B)]
7	Simply believing in your Pokémon will not\nguarantee that you can do everything you want.\c\nBut there are many things that are guaranteed\nto fail if you do not believe in them.\c\nIt is the trust between a Trainer and a Pokémon\nalone that can overcome those hurdles![VAR 0114(002B)]
8	You there!\nYou should know that there is a battle facility\r\non Poni Island called the Battle Tree.\c\nI look forward to seeing what kinds of Trainers\nand Pokémon I can encounter there![VAR 0114(002B)]

1	Oh! Listen to this! I’ve finally figured out the\nsecret of the pond in this garden!\c\nIf you could see this whole garden from above,\nthe pond here would look like a Pokémon!\c\nHow about I give you a little quiz?\nWhat kind of Pokémon does this pond look like?
2	Yungoos
3	Spinda
4	Pikachu
5	Crabrawler
6	Wingull
7	Mareanie
8	Gyarados
9	Pyukumuku
10	Sharpedo
11	I don’t know
12	Don’t just say you don’t know and give up!\nWhy don’t you try walking around the pond?
13	No way! You’re way off...\nWhy don’t you go have a good look at the pond?
14	Bingo! That’s it!\nGive the [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl a prize!\c\nYou got the right answer! The pond in this\ngarden is totally shaped like a Gyarados!\r\nAnd to reward you...I’ll give you something nice!
15	And that’s the end of our quiz!\nGone as quick as an Air Balloon pops!\c\nMaybe I shouldn’t have made it a multiple-\nchoice quiz, after all. It was way too easy!
16	I wonder if whoever designed this garden really\nloved Gyarados or something?\r\nMaybe there’s some really deep meaning to it!
438
0	Ow! Arghhh!\c\nI’ve got dust in my eyes! Dust in my everywhere!\nEven my Pokémon are rubbing their eyes!
1	I’ve been getting so much dust in my eyes in\nthis awful desert, you know?\c\nAnd my Pokémon have been rubbing their\neyes a lot, too...\c\nHow are your Pokémon doing?\nAre their eyes holding up in this mess?
2	They’re burning brightly
3	They’re sniffling all the time
4	They’re looking pretty bleary
5	Well, that sounds like they might not be getting\nenough sleep. Warm them up and let them rest.
6	Wouldn’t that be their noses, not their eyes?\nIf they’ve got snot running down their faces,\r\nbe a good Trainer and wipe it away for them!
7	Well, that doesn’t sound good!\nI’ll give you these, so put ’em on your Pokémon.
8	This Haina Desert, though... It’s a beast.\nI’ve been wandering lost through it for...\r\nWell, I guess it’s been about a year now.\c\nWhen am I ever going to get out of here?
9	Ow! Arghhh!\c\nMore dust in my eyes! What I wouldn’t give for\na pair of Go-Goggles right about now...
439
0	This may be a bit sudden, coming from me,\nbut I’d like you to have these.
1	They are all Pokémon-related items that Madam\nLusamine planned to put in her collection...
2	If you like, I can tell you what any of them does.
3	DNA Splicers
4	Prison Bottle
5	Soul Dew
6	No need
7	Ah, the DNA Splicers...\c\nThey are said to be able to fuse a Pokémon\ncalled Kyurem with either Reshiram or Zekrom.
8	Yes, the Prison Bottle...\c\nApparently it allows a Pokémon called Hoopa\nto change its appearance.
9	Yes, Soul Dew...\c\nIf the Pokémon Latios or Latias holds it, the\npower of their Psychic- and Dragon-type moves\r\nwill both go up by 20%.
10	You can also view the explanations for any\nof the items by checking them out in your Bag.
11	But you know...\neven if it comes from the desire to keep all of\r\nyour beloved Pokémon beside you always...\c\nusing Pokémon moves to put them into a\ncryogenic sleep is too much.
12	The Pokémon who sleep now...\c\nI will keep them safe so that they can someday\nreturn to their previous state...

0	It’s about time for them to start appearing...
1	Tally-ho!\nHey, friend! Isn’t this beach just the best?\c\nThat’s what you’d think, right?
2	But you’d be dead wrong if you did!\nThis beach has a dark secret behind it...\c\nDo you know this beach’s true form?\nThe one it takes on in the dark of night?
3	Hah! So you do know!\c\nYou can’t really know this beach if you only\nsee it during the day. Oh no, you can’t!
4	We make sure that people can enjoy the beach!\nAnd that Pokémon can live in peace!\c\nAnd you can help us do both at once, with one\nfantastic part-time job! What do you say?
5	Fine, fine. I won’t force you or anything.\nI can try to keep chucking ’em all myself...
6	Oh! Thanks a mil’, pal!\nThis job really wears a person out, you know?\c\nCan you wait around here until they start\nappearing? Should be any moment now...
7	You see? They gather quick as anything and\nbury themselves in the sand of the beach.\c\nIf we leave them like that, the tourists end up\nstepping on them as they flock to the beach.\c\nSo every night we chuck ’em back into the sea\nso they get back home safe.
8	You watching? So the most important thing is\nthat you grab ’em good...
9	then spin around real good before letting go\nto chuck ’em right back into the sea!
10	Kinda like the hammer throw, you know?\nDo your best!
11	Chuck all the Pyukumuku that’re on the beach\nback into the sea!\c\nI’ll reward you for your hard work if you do!
12	Now they won’t have to get all dried out on\nthe beach. Mm-hmm!\c\nWe do this every night, so come back again\nanytime you want to help!
13	Phew... I’m beat!\c\nChucking all these Pyukumuku by myself is\nenough to leave me dizzy!
14	Pyuk! Pyuku!
15	You spun around 10 times and then flung the\nPyukumuku back into the sea!
16	Looks like that last one you chucked really was\nthe last one on the beach.
17	Thanks, friend!\c\nChucking all these critters by myself leaves me\ndizzy as I can take!\c\nAnd here’s your reward for helping.
18	Once they’ve come to like a place, those\nPyukumuku will just keep on coming back to it.\c\nSo we end up having to do this every single\nnight. Come help again anytime you feel like it!
19	You gonna give up without finishing the job?

10	Sorry... I hope you weren’t frightened just now.\c\nThat Magnemite is actually my Pokémon.\c\nI’m really sorry if it gave you a shock.\nWill you take this TM, with my apologies?
11	Magnemite loves electricity, but the power at\nmy place got shut off...\c\nSo I bring it here to the power station like this\nsometimes, but it seems like the fresh power\r\nfrom this place has a particular flavor.

10	How about you join me in a battle and provide it\nwith a bit of exercise to aid the ol’ digestion?
11	I’d be happy to
12	Not right now
13	What, you got other plans or something?\nLet me know if you change your mind.
14	Good! You’ve got chutzpah, my friend!\nThen let’s get this thing happening!
15	Heh! Not too shabby...just like I’d figured!\nYou’ve got something in you, kid.
16	Amazing... You even beat my fa—\c\nI mean, my boss’s Muk...
17	What’re you doing standing there like a lump?!\nYou’re up next, you useless dullard!
18	Wh-what?! Me... Me and Grimer?!\nThere’s no way we could win against this kid!
19	You see! It’s just like you did with your trials\nwhen you were a kid!\c\nThe moment something starts to look tough,\nyou give a cry and off you run! You give up!\r\nAnd you’re supposed to be my son!\c\nHow can I leave this plant to you if you never\nlearn the value of a bit of hard work?\c\nI can’t ever leave things in your hands if you\ndon’t give me reason to trust you can handle it!
20	F-Father...
21	... ... ...\c\nFine! We’ll do it!
22	I will not run away anymore!\nI will give this everything that I’ve got!
23	Then I’ll take you on
24	Give me a minute
25	I’m counting on you, kid. Help me out here.
26	I am a man now!\c\nJust you watch, Father!\nI mean, sir!
27	Blast it all!
28	You...
29	I...I’m sorry, Father...\nI really am...just a weakling...
30	You’re hired!
31	F-Father?
32	I’m not your father! I’m your boss!\nAnd I’m saying that you are hired, boy!\c\nFrom this day forth, I’m making you the head\nof the plant! And I won’t hear another word of\r\ncomplaint about it from you!
33	Wha—?
34	You saw that this Trainer was stronger than\nyou or even me...\c\nand still you and your Grimer went up against\nh[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer with everything that you had in you.\c\nThat’s what I’ve always wanted to see from you!\nThat kind of persistence and drive!\c\nAnd that’s why you and Grimer...\nThat’s why you’re going to take over for me.
35	Th-thank you, sir! Father, sir!\nI mean, Mr. Former President, sir!
36	Sorry for using you to teach my boy a lesson.\c\nBut when I saw that island challenge amulet\nyou had there, it just hit me, you know?\c\nTake this for your troubles.\nIt may be twisted, but it’s not garbage!
37	Now that I’ve got my successor sorted out,\nI can finally retire to a life of peace and quiet.\c\nI think I can trust my boy’s crew to keep\non eating up all of Alola’s garbage from now on!
38	Yes, sir! You can, sir!
39	You again, young trial-goer!\c\nThanks again for helping me set my son to\nrights before.
40	Me and my Grimer have been working really\nhard ever since then.\c\nYou do your best, too.\nI’ll be hoping you succeed in your own dreams!
41	Gri-i-ime...

0	Are you a lucky person?
1	Then you probably can use this without any\nproblem.
2	Really? Then win luck over to your side\nwith this.
3	A Lucky Punch...\nIf you let Chansey hold this item, the critical-hit\r\nratio of Chansey’s moves will go up!\c\nYou’ll be really lucky!

0	Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLooks like you’re really givin’ it your all. Yeah!\c\nYou’ve got a lot of Pokémon registered in your\nPokédex now![VAR 0114(0005)]

2	Hahaha! Rotom’s pretty fired up about it, too!\nOf course, I am, too! So I’ve got a little\r\nsomething for you.[VAR 0114(0005)]
3	When you have a Pokémon hold a Lucky Egg,\nit grows up faster! Some evolved Pokémon\r\ndon’t appear in the wild, so it’s useful to have\r\none of these if you’re trying to fill a Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0005)]

0	Well...I’m afraid that the little kerfuffle we went\nthrough resulted in my demotion.\c\nI am turning over a new leaf and beginning over\nas one of the rank and file.\c\nWhen all is said and done, I feel like I’ve become\na completely different person. In mind and body.[VAR 0114(0015)]
1	Could the new and improved Faba request a\nbattle with you?[VAR 0114(0015)]
2	Of course
3	I’d rather not
4	Then here I come!\nThe new and improved Faba makes his debut![VAR 0114(0015)]
5	No! Does my new and improved form so\nintimidate you?[VAR 0114(0015)]
6	So what did you think of the new and improved\nFaba, hmm?\c\nWith my newfound charm, you will see me\nmake my comeback within the foundation!\c\nAnd for that I will have to gain quite a bit of\nsupport behind me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
7	That is just a little token from me,\nso you won’t forget the new Faba.\c\nNow watch as I work my way up the ladder of\nthe foundation once more![VAR 0114(0015)]
8	When I was reduced to this low-ranking\nposition, I had a sudden revelation.\c\nI desperately long for that title of respect![VAR 0114(0015)]

1	Sis?
2	Crew?
3	Oh, uh, sorry, guess I should explain...\nSee, I’m apprenticing here to become a cook.\c\nAnd Sis is the owner’s daughter. Mallow.\nHer family owns this restaurant, you know?
4	Oh, uh, sorry. I was in Team Skull, you know?\nSo I got kinda used to talking like that, yeah?\c\nI mean, you’re one of Mallow’s friends, right?\nI’m apprenticing here to become a cook.
5	Anyway, Mallow asked me to give you these.
6	She said it was your reward for becoming the\nChampion, you know?\c\nBut she’s kinda shy, you know?\nSo she gave ’em to me to give to you.\c\nOh, but she told me I shouldn’t tell you that.\nSo forget about it—you got that?
7	Mallow, like, totally saved me.\nI wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for her.\c\nShe got me this job when Team Skull fell apart\nand I had nowhere left to go.\c\nOh, but she didn’t want me to tell anyone about\nthat either ’cause she’s so modest. Huh.
8	I’m gonna do my best now, and I’m gonna \nbecome a real chef. You’ll see!
451
0	You’re [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nThank you for helping out our Mallow.\c\nOh. I know!\c\nHere. Take this for stopping by.\c\nI already used it for making stock, but that\nshouldn’t stop your Pokémon from enjoying it.
1	It’s good to give Dragon-type Pokémon a\nDragon Fang to hold on to.\c\nThough we cooks tend to use them for rather\ndifferent purposes, as you can see!
2	I hope you and Mallow will stay friends!

1	Ruff ruff!

4	See? Thanks to this clever girl, and her lovely\nvoice, writing new songs is as easy as pie!\c\nI know I probably don’t even need to ask, but...\nYou have heard of me before, right?
5	Never have
6	Not till today
7	Whoa! That is bad news for you, friend!\nYou are clearly behind on the times!
8	I guess I’ll make sure people know who I am!\nIf not through songs, then through battle!
9	All right
10	I’m fine not knowing you
11	Well, whenever you want to get a taste for the\nfuture, you are always welcome to come back!
12	That’s the tune I’ve been waiting to hear!\nI hope you’re ready to face Future!
13	Would you look at that, Hit?\nThis Trainer is amazing!\c\nI think I’ve thought of my next future hit melody\nthanks to that battle!

15	Look at that! Even Hit is getting excited!\nShe’s normally so laid-back about everything!\c\nLet me give you a little present to thank you\nfor this dose of inspiration!

0	I am a Trainer who uses the Red Card item.\nI want to be shaken by your strength...\c\nI want to face you when you’ve shown that you\ncan defeat every last Trainer on Route 3!
1	So you’ve defeated all of the Trainers along\nRoute 3, have you?\c\nYou have shaken me from my calm repose!\nMy heart was a still water, but no longer!
2	I feel my heart trembling!\nSo you’ve come again!
3	Shall we start?\nLet’s have a soul-shaking battle!
4	I accept
5	I refuse
6	My soul is calm and unruffled.
7	That is a good reply.
8	I will stand before you as a Red Card user!
9	It was a fine battle.\c\nMy heart feels as light and clear as the blue\nsky that appears after a storm passes through.
10	This is proof of the battle between your team\nand my own.\c\nA Red Card! Take it, my strong friend!
11	The effects of the Red Card are as I illustrated\nto you in battle.\c\nYou will likely find other Trainers like me on\nthe routes of Alola. Searching for strength.\c\nChallenging them together with your Pokémon\nwould not be a bad reason to take a journey. 
12	What’s that? You want to battle me even when\nI’m using my full force?\c\nFine. Then beat every other Trainer on Route 8\nand we can talk.
13	You beat all of the Trainers along Route 8?\c\nThen it looks like it’s finally my time to shine!
14	What a wicked little Trainer you are for making\nme wait like that...
15	Now let’s get this thing started, shall we?
16	Yes, please!
17	No, wait!
18	If you make me wait too long then I’ll run out\nof power for my full-force attacks!
19	Then here I go!
20	It’s time for me and my Pokémon’s\nZ-powered performance!
21	Well, that’s the end of me and my Pokémon’s\nZ-powered performance!
22	Thanks for taking part in the show!\nTake this with you as a souvenir!
23	I bet you can find other full-force Trainers like\nme on the routes of Alola looking for strong\r\nfoes to take on in battle.\c\nWouldn’t it be fun to take a little detour and\nsearch them all out?
24	Looks like you’re a fellow Trainer who can use\nZ-Power in battle.\c\nLet’s find out whose full-force strength is the,\nuh, fullest!\c\nBeat all of the Trainers in this tunnel if you\nthink you can take me on!
25	Looks like you did what I asked and beat all of\nthe Trainers in this tunnel, huh?\c\nWell then, my Z-powered challenger...\c\ndo you want to compare Z’s with me?\nWe’ll see whose Z is the best!
26	I’ve been waiting for you!\nTrainer who can wield the full force of Z-Power!
27	Then let us have a Z-battle to Z-prove who\nhas the best Z-moves!
28	Let’s start
29	Hold on
30	Being cautious, are you?\nThen you must not have a lot of Z-Power!
31	That’s a good answer. But I hope you’re ready.\nMy Z-Power is not to be trifled with!
32	Our full-force Z-Power competition begins now!
33	Very well done! That is some real Z-Power!\nYour Z is the most Z of any Z!
34	Let me award you with this token to show how\nhighly I value and respect your Z!
35	There are probably other Z-Trainers like me out\nand about in Alola.\c\nIf you want to achieve the ultimate in Z, then\nsearch them out and challenge them all.
36	I am the one known as the kahuna of Route 12!\c\nIf you hope to battle me, then beat every other\nTrainer on Route 12 first!
37	It appears you have completed your training\nand defeated Route 12’s other Trainers...\c\nThen I, the kahuna of Route 12, will honor you\nwith a battle!
38	I’ve been waiting for you.\nMy reckless little challenger.
39	I’ll show you the Z-Power of a Route 12 kahuna!
40	Let’s do it
41	I’m not ready...
42	And I was just getting warmed up, too!\nCome on, kid. Don’t make me wait too long...
43	Hee hee hee...\nSo you think you’re ready, do you?
44	This is the devastating Z-Power of the great\nkahuna of Route 12!
45	Rgh!\nI have been...done in...
46	I yield to you the title of Route 12 kahuna...\nand this as well...
47	I cannot allow myself to be satisfied with the\ntitle of kahuna in such a small area as this...\c\nI think it’s time that I start setting my goals\non the wider world as well!
48	Let me guess. You were wondering what a\nGolfer would be doing in a meadow like this.\c\nIf you want an answer to that question, then\ndefeat all of the Trainers in this meadow first.
49	Ho! Congratulations to you!\nYou’ve beat all the Trainers in the meadow!\c\nThen I’ll tell you why I am here...\c\nI am here waiting for a worthy Trainer like you!
50	Ho! So you’ve come again?\nI’ve been practicing my swing as I wait for you!
51	So what do you say?\nWill you have a Pokémon battle against me?
52	I will
53	No thanks
54	What, really?\nCome on! We should have a battle!
55	My special strategy hinges on my use of an\nitem called the Flame Orb!
56	This Golfer’s on fire!\nHere comes my full-powered best shot!
57	Mm-hmm. Just as I’d thought...\c\nYou have what it takes to be the next wielder\nof my precious Flame Orb...\c\nMm-hmm!\nI’m glad that I waited here for you so long.
58	Take it...my Flame Orb...
59	There! And that’s that!\c\nI don’t know if it’s simply a part of getting older,\nbut lately I’ve been completely hooked on golf.\c\nI’d gotten a bit burnt out as a Trainer and could\nno longer use that Flame Orb as I should have.\c\nUsing it wisely takes a bit of tricky thinking, but\nif you figure it out, it’ll pay you back in spades!
60	It takes a great deal of endurance and spirit\nto keep dancing without any pause. ♪\c\nIf you’d like to battle me, then you’ll have to\nshow that you have the endurance and spirit\r\nto rout all of the Trainers in the area first. ♪
61	Lovely. So you’ve defeated all the other Trainers\naround here, have you? ♪\c\nIt looks like you’ve got endurance and spirit. ♪

72	Oh! You’re the one from the great composition!\c\nI just did a hundred sketches, so now I’m taking\na break.\c\nI beat all the Trainers around here, too, so now\nI’m totally bored again...\r\nI wish there was someone to go all out against.\c\nThat’s it!

96	I’m one of the Trial Guides that are here to help\nyou kids out during your island challenge.\c\nBut the job that I was tasked with is actually\nto test how your skills are coming along.\c\nSo why don’t you show me you can beat every\nlast Trainer on Route 15? Then come back here.
97	Looks like you didn’t waste much time going\nthrough all the Trainers on Route 15!\c\nIf you’re that good, then I guess I’ll pull out my\nZ-Power, too.
98	Hey! Back again?\nHow’s it going, little trial-goer?
99	Think you can take on my little trial?
100	Yes, please
101	Not yet
102	You sure you’re up to this?\nPrepare real good before you come back.
103	I like your spirit, kid.\nI think I’m getting fired up, too!
104	Then the full-powered little trial of this trial\nguide is about to start!
105	Nice! You cleared my little trial.\nYou’re a real tough little trial-goer.
106	Here’s your reward from me.\nTake it and carry on with your adventure!
107	All the trial-goers I see out and about on their\nisland challenges have such great smiles...\c\nThey’re as beautiful as the brilliant moon that\nhangs in Alola’s night sky.\c\nThe work doesn’t pay a lick, but I can’t give it\nup when it lets me see those happy faces.
108	What? You want a little tête–à–tête with a\nZ-Ring user like yours truly?\c\nThen become the number two Trainer in all of\nPoni Plains, baby.
109	Looks like you managed to claw your way up\nto the number two spot in Poni Plains, huh?\c\nThen I guess you’ve earned a little rendezvous\nwith the number-one Trainer: me!
110	Hey, number two!\nYou planning to make me wait forever?
111	What do you say?\nIs it time for our little showdown?
112	Let’s battle!
113	Not yet!
114	OK...but I’m not going anywhere.\nThe number-one Trainer doesn’t run away.
115	You can’t just choose the cool-looking Pokémon\nand think you can win...
116	The full power of the number-one Trainer is\ngoing to finish you off for the day!
117	Oh, baby! I’ve gotta give you a hand!\nYou are worthy of being the next number one!
118	So here you go, babe.\nA little present from me!
119	There aren’t too many Trainers who’ve mastered\nusing their Z-Powers.\c\nSo don’t forget I’m one of those special few!\nPlease, baby!
120	Sorry, youngster, but I can’t fight you.\c\nMy Pokémon is like a brother to me.\nAnd he’s not interested in battling weaklings.\c\nIf you want me to ask him to fight against you,\nthen beat all the Trainers on Mount Hokulani.
121	Are you the one who defeated all the Trainers\non Mount Hokulani then?\c\nAll right then. Fair enough.\nI like kids with a bit of pep.
122	Made me wait, didn’t you?
123	I’ll be using my Z-Power against you.\nYou ready for a scuffle?
124	Sure I am
125	Not yet
126	Hmph. Fine, kid.
127	I think I feel something coming over me...
128	Sorry, kid, but my Pokémon doesn’t know the\nmeaning of the word “moderation!”
129	You...\nYou’ve got some good Pokémon, kid.
130	Thanks for showing my brother a good time.\nHere’s your thanks.
131	You know, Z-Power is more or less the power\nof the pledge you’ve made to your Pokémon.\c\nAnd my relationship with my Pokémon is closer\nthan that of a parent or a brother or anything.

0	Young Master Gladion is doing a fine job as\nthe acting president of the foundation.\c\nBut don’t you think it would be more appropriate\nto have an adult like me fill the position...?[VAR 0114(0015)]
1	You’re right
2	You think so?
3	You are surprisingly intelligent for a child![VAR 0114(0015)]
4	This is why I hate dealing with child—\c\nEr, I mean...\c\nI find it so interesting talking with children.[VAR 0114(0015)]
459
0	So you came...[VAR 0114(0013)]
1	I guess I’ve got to thank you again for all you’ve\ndone for my family...\c\nEspecially...for Lillie.\c\nI never knew she could smile like that.[VAR 0114(0013)]
2	My mother’s desires to reach Nihilego...\nand what she did in order to achieve that goal...\r\nI know she was completely out of control.\r\nBut that doesn’t mean I can’t understand it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
3	It was my father who started it.\c\nHe was the one who first confirmed the\nexistence of Ultra Wormholes and Ultra Beasts.[VAR 0114(0013)]
4	But my father...\c\nHe disappeared during an experiment.\nTrying to connect to an Ultra Wormhole.\c\nAll that he left behind was a weakened Cosmog\nand his papers about Nihilego...[VAR 0114(0013)]
5	Lusamine’s obsession with Ultra Wormholes...\nand her obsession with the Ultra Beasts...\c\nI think it was all basically her way of trying to\nreach him again.\r\nThat’s what I had to believe. To get through it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
6	It’s not an apology or anything, but...\nI hope you’ll take this fellow.[VAR 0114(0013)]
7	[~ 7]
8	And I’ll give you all the memory drives that let\nits Evolution, Silvally, change its type...[VAR 0114(0013)]
9	You received a whole stack of memory drives!
10	This is a different Type: Null.\nNot the same one that I ran away with...\c\nIt was kept in Secret Lab A. Its very existence\nwas a secret.[VAR 0114(0013)]
11	But I think I know you well enough.\nI think I can trust you to show it the world.[VAR 0114(0013)]
12	Hmph...\c\nMaybe it’s time I see a bit more of the\nworld myself...\c\nand starting with that Pokémon League, I think.\c\nI hear that Alola’s got a real strong Champion.[VAR 0114(0013)]
13	You can’t even take Type: Null?\nHow many Pokémon have you collected?\c\nI can’t even believe you...\c\nFine. Come back when you’re ready to take it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
460
0	[VAR 0100(0000)].\nWelcome back.[VAR 0114(0016)]
1	I have to tell you how much I appreciate what\nyou did for Miss Lillie and Madam Lusamine.[VAR 0114(0016)]
2	Miss Lillie asked me a last favor before she left.\c\nShe wanted me to explain to you why\nshe and her mother had to go to Kanto.[VAR 0114(0016)]
3	You see...\c\nwhile we do not know if it was because of\nNihilego’s neurotoxins, her fusion with that\r\nbeast, or the strain of the Z-Power...[VAR 0114(0016)]
4	the ill effects of this episode on Madam\nLusamine’s body and mind have been undeniable.\r\nShe has hardly roused since.[VAR 0114(0016)]
5	But Miss Lillie found a ray of hope in a book\nthat she remembered reading long ago.[VAR 0114(0016)]
6	It was regarding a man named Bill, who invented\nthe Pokémon Storage System used in our PCs.[VAR 0114(0016)]
7	This inventor, who lives in the Kanto region,\nonce combined himself with a Pokémon in an\r\nexperiment that apparently went awry...[VAR 0114(0016)]
8	Just like Lusamine...
9	Why would he do that?
10	Yes, perhaps there are even more examples in\nthe world of people fusing with Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0016)]
11	I suppose it was the same sort of curiosity\nthat led him to develop our storage system.[VAR 0114(0016)]
12	The records of this event, however, say that\nhe was separated from the Pokémon by using\r\nhis Teleporter and a Cell Separation System.[VAR 0114(0016)]
13	Perhaps using the same kind of procedure on\nMadam Lusamine will be able to remove the\r\nlast of the beast’s poisons from her system.\c\nThat is what Miss Lillie was hoping when she\nheaded to Kanto.[VAR 0114(0016)]
14	It pained me greatly when both Miss Lillie and\nyoung Master Gladion left Aether Paradise...\c\nbut I am so proud to see the fine young people\nthat they have become.[VAR 0114(0016)]
15	Even sheltered little Master Gladion tried to\npatch up his own clothing, he said, when his\r\npartner Null tore them...[VAR 0114(0016)]
16	Oh! I’m sorry. You probably aren’t interested\nin hearing about that sort of thing, are you?\c\nHere, please accept this.[VAR 0114(0016)]
17	... ... ...\c\nOh! And take another, too![VAR 0114(0016)]
18	Now I’ll be returning to Secret Lab B so that\nI can get back to work.[VAR 0114(0016)]

2	If you collect all Cells and Cores, please visit the\nAether Base on Route 16 on Ula’ula Island.\c\nUse the Reassembly Unit there, and you can\ntransform them into a Zygarde![VAR 0114(0027)]
3	While we were having you look into Zygarde\nfor us...[VAR 0114(0026)]
4	we were looking into the Z-Ring, too.[VAR 0114(0026)]
5	It’s so mysterious...\c\nto be talking about Mega Evolution here, in a\nregion so far away from Kalos...[VAR 0114(0026)]
6	But we are Trainers.\c\nRather than explaining it all in words, why don’t\nwe just show you what Mega Evolution is![VAR 0114(0027)]
7	The Trainer holds the Key Stone!\c\nThe Pokémon holds the Mega Stone!\c\nAnd that’s how you can make your Pokémon\nMega Evolve during battle![VAR 0114(0027)]
8	You can use the Z-Ring!\c\nSo you must be able to use a Key Stone that\nmakes Mega Stones resonate![VAR 0114(0026)]
9	If you have a Key Stone, you’ll be able to make\nyour Pokémon that hold a Mega Stone\r\nMega Evolve![VAR 0114(0027)]
10	This is a Mega Stone that makes Alakazam\nMega Evolve. It’s called an Alakazite!\c\nI’ll give the Key Stone and an Alakazite to you![VAR 0114(0027)]
11	You know, when you think about it...\c\nThe Z-Ring helps the feelings of a Trainer\nreach his or her Pokémon and makes it so it\r\ncan use its Z-Power, right?\c\nIt only follows that it should be able to achieve\nMega Evolution, too![VAR 0114(0026)]
12	We’ll be taking our leave now!\nBon voyage![VAR 0114(0026)]

0	We occasionally ask Professor Kukui to run a\nspecial class for our school.\c\nHe’s done a great deal of research into Pokémon\nmoves, after all.
1	Pokémon moves have PP. Um. Power Points.\c\nIf the PP for a move runs out, your Pokémon\nwon’t be able to use it anymore.\c\nNot till you get it restored, I mean. And you can\njust take it to a Pokémon Center for that!
2	Who do you think picks up all the Poké Balls\nyou throw that don’t catch any Pokémon?
3	I can read! Here, watch.\c\n“Moves have types, just like Pokémon...\c\n“If you use a move that’s the same type as your\nPokémon, it will get a special boost in power!”
4	Petting my Pokémon makes me happy, too!
5	There is writing on the blackboard.\nIt describes how types match up.\c\nGrass is weak to Fire.\nWater is weak to Grass.\r\nFire is weak to Water.\c\nThere are many more types, too, and they have\ntheir own weaknesses, just like these three.
6	Healing Your Pokémon\nWhen your Pokémon are injured or suffering \nfrom some status condition, either get them to\na Pokémon Center or use the appropriate \nmedicines on them!
506
0	Abilities are basically special skills all Pokémon\nhave that can make special things happen.\c\nTake the Ability called Limber, for example...\c\nAny Pokémon who has that Ability won’t ever\nbe paralyzed by an opponent’s moves!
1	When you begin to level up as a Trainer and\nlearn advanced strategies, you’ll want to pay\r\nattention to Abilities. They can be a huge help!
2	All Pokémon have some sort of Ability...\c\nBut even members of the same species don’t\nalways have the same Ability as one another.\c\nWhich Ability you’ll want your Pokémon to have\nwill depend somewhat on how you like to battle.
3	Let’s see here...\c\nSo, if you choose to view a Pokémon’s summary,\nyou can see what Ability that Pokémon has.\c\nWhen you touch the “i” for more information,\nyou can see what that Ability does.\c\nMaybe I’d remember it all better if the textbook\nwasn’t written to be so boring!
4	My Lillipup picked this up.\nHere, you take it.
5	Lillipup’s Ability is Pickup!\c\nIt’s an awesome Ability that works even when\nyou’re not in battle.\c\nI went all the way to Akala Island to find a\nLillipup and catch it just to have this Ability.
6	There is writing on the blackboard.\c\nIt describes some of the physical changes that\na Pokémon can experience in battle.
7	What would you like to read about?
8	If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will steadily lose HP\nduring battle.\c\nThe poison won’t disappear after the battle\neither, so heal poisoning with an Antidote.
9	Paralysis reduces Speed and may prevent\nPokémon from using any moves.\c\nParalysis also lingers after battle, so use a\nParalyze Heal to clear up its nasty effects.
10	If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be unable to\nattack till it wakes.\c\nThe Pokémon may wake up on its own, but if\nthe battle ends first, then it will stay asleep.\c\nYou can wake it up using an Awakening.
11	Burns lower a Pokémon’s Attack and steadily\nreduce their HP. They linger even after battle.\c\nYou can cure burns using a Burn Heal.
12	If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes completely\nhelpless.\c\nIt may thaw out on its own, but if the battle\nends first, it will remain frozen thereafter.\c\nYou can thaw it out using an Ice Heal.
13	Poisoning

19	On How to Trigger Abilities\nMethod 1: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon appears in a battle, and its effects will\nthen continue as long as that Pokémon remains\nin the battle.\c\nMethod 2: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon takes an attack from an opponent.\n\nMethod 3: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon is not in a Pokémon battle.
507
0	Slowpoke’s Yawn is a move that can put\nyour opponent to sleep in battle.\c\nWhen a Pokémon is asleep, it can’t do anything\nuntil it wakes up, so it can give you a chance\r\nagainst a Pokémon you’re having trouble with.
1	Ya-a-awn...

5	The Guardians and the Ancient Kings\nIn ancient times, the tapu served as the leaders\nof the armies of each island’s king, but if they\nused their Z-Power in battle, it caused great\ndestruction across the islands.\c\nBecause of this, the tapu came to no longer\nlend their aid in the wars of men.

1	We uncover the universe by having our huge\ncomputer calculate and calculate until there’s\r\nnothing left to calculate anymore!\c\nPlease don’t fail us now, computer!
2	Modern astronomical telescopes are basically\nlike amazingly good digital cameras, you know.\c\nWe don’t really look through them at space so\nmuch as we have them take photos of space\r\nso that we can see what’s happening up there.
3	Hokulani Observatory News\c\nThis month’s column is about Pokémon and\nthe stars. Do you know which of the many\r\nPokémon discovered have to do with the\r\nstars? Our columnist is here to tell you!\c\nGothitelle:\nThey can predict the future from the\r\nplacement and movement of the stars.\r\nThey can see Trainers’ life spans.\c\nCleffa:\nWhen numerous meteors illuminate the night\r\nsky, sightings of Cleffa strangely increase.

3	Oh, hello! Hello! Alola![VAR 0114(0034)]
4	Here in the Alola region, volcanic eruptions can\nresult in long, thin strands of magma...\r\nThey form strands of glass rather like hair!\c\nBut the hair on the Diglett here is not glass,\nbut rather whiskers of some metallic substance.\c\nThey use them for communication and as a sort\nof sensor to investigate their surroundings.[VAR 0114(0034)]

7	It’s a photo of a power plant in Kanto.\c\nThe entire power plant was once put out of\noperation by the loss of a single Machine Part.\c\nThis power plant was abandoned for a time,\nbut the Legendary Pokémon Zapdos was said\r\nto have revealed itself to mankind there once.
8	It’s a photo of a power plant in Kalos.\c\nIn the Kalos region, the light of the sun is\ngathered in space and energy extracted from\r\nit in the form of microwaves which can then\r\nbe sent back to the planet’s surface.\c\nThey have a Pokémon called Porygon that\nhelps them with the work out in space.
9	It’s a pamphlet from the power plant.\nThis one’s about Pokémon that live underground.\c\nDugtrio living in the Kanto region work together\nas a trio and can tunnel 60 miles belowground.
10	Are you a visitor? No worries. We can dig it!\nHere at the Geothermal Power Plant, we love\r\nhaving more pals to share our energy with!
11	The Steam Separator\c\nGeothermal reservoirs underground contain\nhigh-pressure water that has been heated up\r\nby the magma within the planet.\c\nThis device helps separate the heated fluid\nfrom the reservoirs into steam and hot water.
12	Regarding Steam Turbines\c\nBy directing steam to pass over the turbine’s\nblades and spin it on its axis, you can keep the\r\nturbine in motion to generate power.
13	The Generator\c\nThe steam turbines spin at a speed of 3,600\nrevolutions per minute, powering the generator\r\nand producing electricity.\c\nIt may seem like the generator organ in Vikavolt,\nbut it works on an entirely different principle.
14	The Cooling Tower\c\nThis is where the water from the steam used\nby the generator cools.\c\nOnce the water has been cooled sufficiently, it\ncan then be reused to cool more steam.
15	Producing Geothermal Energy: Step 1\c\nWith the help of digging Pokémon, scientists\nsearch for underground steam vents in the\r\narea around active volcanoes.
16	Producing Geothermal Energy: Step 2\c\nOver a long period of time, and with the help of\nmany Pokémon that can work underground,\r\nthe power plant is constructed.
17	Producing Geothermal Energy: Step 3\c\nThe steam that is naturally produced due to\nunderground heat is used to turn turbines and\r\ngenerate electricity.
18	Producing Geothermal Energy: Step 4\c\nThe Geothermal Power Plant produces clean\nenergy that is good for the environment, thanks\r\nto its relatively small carbon footprint.
19	There are souvenirs on sale with the Geothermal\nPower Plant’s logo, like towels and things.
20	There are souvenirs on sale, like postcards with\npictures of the Geothermal Power Plant and\r\nsnacks made by cooking Berries in the steam\r\nthat erupts from Blush Mountain!

25	The underground part of the planet is huge!\nD’you think Pokémon pop out sometimes?
26	Pokémon with the Magma Armor Ability will\nnever get frozen solid!
27	Hmm... I may be the teacher here, but all I even\nunderstand from all this is that Pokémon and\r\nvolcanoes are pretty amazingly powerful!
28	You think the volcanoes on Ula’ula were created\nby some huge Pokémon?\c\nThen I guess we have that Pokémon to thank\nfor us all living here now! Hah!
