Hi! Do you want to trade your Rattata for\nmy Rattata?
That’s too bad.
[~ 2]
Awww! I’m so happy!\nLet’s get started!
Were you surprised?\nMy Rattata is from the Alola region!\c\nSome Pokémon have different appearances and\neven types depending on where they were born,\r\neven if they are the same species.
Hi! Do you want to trade your Rattata from\nKanto for my Rattata from Alola again?
Thanks!
I’ve come here to collect a lot of\nKantonian [VAR PKNAME(0004)].\c\nIf you have [VAR iCOLOR2(0004)][VAR PKNAME(0004)], please trade it\nfor my [VAR PKNAME(0004)]!
...I see.\nIf you change your mind, let me know.
[~ 9]
Are you giving me that Pokémon?\nAll right. Deal!
Thanks for the great trade!\c\nAlolan [VAR PKNAME(0004)] are Ice type,\nunlike [VAR PKNAME(0004)] in Kanto.
Will you trade your Kantonian [VAR PKNAME(0004)]\nfor my [VAR PKNAME(0004)] again?
Thank you! Ah... I absolutely love\nKantonian [VAR PKNAME(0004)].\c\nOf course, I adore Alolan [VAR PKNAME(0004)], too!
Do Kantonian Diglett look smooth?\nMy Diglett looks prickly.\c\nDo you want to trade our Diglett?
You’re playing hardball, aren’t you.
[~ 16]
Tee-hee. So exciting.\nLet’s do this.
Wow, it’s true!\nIt looks so smooth!\c\nThank you so much!\nLet’s trade again, OK?
Do you want to trade your smooth-looking\nDiglett for my prickly looking Diglett again?
No matter how many Kantonian Diglett I’ve\nseen, they still look so smooth and adorable!\r\nPlease trade again!
...Are you interested in Dark-type Pokémon?\c\nIf you have [VAR iCOLOR2(0004)][VAR PKNAME(0004)], maybe I could\ntrade my Dark-type [VAR PKNAME(0004)] for it...?
Heh... Suit yourself.
[~ 23]
Heh... Have you made up your mind?\nOK. Let’s make a deal.
Dark-type [VAR PKNAME(0004)] are pretty cute,\naren’t they?
You want more Dark-type Pokémon?\c\nIf you have a Kantonian [VAR PKNAME(0004)],\nI wouldn’t mind trading my [VAR PKNAME(0004)]\r\nfor it...
...You really like this, don’t you.\nIf you want to shroud yourself in darkness again,\r\ncome see me.
I’m a huge Raichu fan who came all the way\nfrom Alola!\c\nLet’s trade your Kantonian Raichu and\nmy Raichu!
It’s so cute, though!
[~ 30]
Have you decided?\nAll righty, then. Let’s trade!
Alolan Raichu is Electric and Psychic type.\c\nIt’s a wonderful Pokémon that can learn Psychic\nfrom a TM.
I’m a huge Raichu fan who came all the way\nfrom Alola!\c\nLet’s trade your Kantonian Raichu and\nmy Alolan Raichu again!
Please spread the word to the world about how\ncute Alolan Raichu is!
You! Do you have a Ground-type Marowak?\c\nIf possible, I’d like to trade my Marowak for it.
No pressure, of course.
[~ 37]
Are you mentally prepared for the trade?\nAll right, then.
Whoopee! I love Ground-type Marowak.\nLet’s trade again when we have a chance.
I’d like to trade my Alolan Marowak for your\nGround-type Marowak.\c\nWhat do you say?
I knew it. I just love the Kantonian\nGround-type Marowak.\c\nLet’s trade again when we have a chance.
Hey, you! If you have an Exeggutor, I’ll trade my\nExeggutor for it. I’m very proud of my Exeggutor.\r\nWhat do you think?
You don’t want it?\nI’m very proud of my Exeggutor, though.
[~ 44]
Please accept my Exeggutor. I’m so proud of it.
This Exeggutor is amazing, right?\c\nIn the faraway Alola region, they grow up\ncarefree, so they get really tall!
Do you want to get another one of the\nExeggutor that make me so proud?\c\nIf you give me a short-necked Exeggutor,\nI’ll give you another one of mine in return.
There’s such a big difference just because\nthey grow up in different environments.\c\nLife is so mysterious.
Hello there, [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0A03)]sonyoung lady.\nHow would you like to trade your Geodude for\r\nmy Geodude?
Hmmm... Well, that’s too bad.
Hoho! Delightful!\nIn that case, let us begin!
Bahahaha! Surprised, aren’t you?\nMy Geodude is from Alola!\c\nIf you bring more Kantonian Geodude, I’ll be\nhappy to trade with you anytime!
Oh ho! Are you here to trade Geodude again?
Friendship nurtured by trading Geodude...\c\nHow wonderful!\nBahahahaha!

I came here with some friends to catch us some\nBug-type Pokémon!\c\nMy pals are all itching to get into some\nPokémon battles!
I was throwing Poké Balls to catch Pokémon, and\nI ran out of them.\c\nThat’s why you can never have too many\nPoké Balls.
Trainer Tips\c\nShake your Joy-Con when it’s not attached to\nyour system, and you can play with your partner!
Trainer Tips\c\nFor poison, use Antidote!\nFor paralysis, use Paralyze Heal!\c\nGet them at Poké Marts!
Trainer Tips\c\nVisit Professor Oak at his research lab to have\nhim check out your progress on your Pokédex!
Trainer Tips\c\nIf you catch a Pokémon, the Pokémon in your\nparty can earn Exp. Points!\c\nIf you catch an unusually large Pokémon, you’ll\nget even more Exp. Points!\c\n...Small Pokémon work, too!
Trainer Tips\c\nHow you try to catch a Pokémon depends on\nthe kind of controller you’re using.\c\nIf you change your controller, you can check\nthe Help option that appears on\c\nthe Pokémon-catching screen for\na quick tutorial!

Hmm?
Wh-what’s this?!
OAK: That was a pretty fine performance for\na first timer, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl!
Why don’t you pick up that Poké Ball and give\nthe [VAR PKNAME(0002)] you caught a name?

OAK: A perfectly reasonable reaction, my boy!\nYou see, one of them is [VAR iCOLOR2(0002)][VAR PKNAME(0002)] that\r\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)] caught just now.
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: So, wait, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nYou caught it yourself?
Wha—?! I’ve never seen that happen before!

Well, my [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0403)]boygirl, this is it! Take that Poké Ball—\nand keep good hold of it this time!

Now that you two are setting out as Trainers,\nI’d like to ask your help with something.\c\nTake this with you on your journeys.
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: What is that thing, Professor?
OAK: This is the Pokédex that I’ve designed!\c\nIt automatically records data on Pokémon you’ve\nseen or caught, and it makes an entry for each.\c\nIt’s an extremely high-tech tool!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)] and [VAR TRNAME(0001)]...\nI want you each to take one with you!
You got a [VAR COLOR(0006)]Pokédex[VAR COLOR(0000)] from Professor Oak!
OAK: You’ll find you can’t get very detailed data\non Pokémon by just seeing them.\c\nYou must catch a Pokémon to gather the most\ncomplete data!
To make a complete guide to all the Pokémon\nin the world...\c\nThat was my dream!
But I’m an old man now!\nToo old to get the job done myself.
That’s why I want you young Trainers to fulfill\nmy dream for me!
Get moving, you two!\c\nThis is a great undertaking in Pokémon history!
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: A Pokédex, huh?\c\nWe’re gonna meet so many Pokémon...\nThis keeps getting better and better!
I’m setting out right now!\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you should do the same...\r\nIf you think you’re ready, that is!

[VAR 01CD(0001)]: Aw, jeez...\nThere I went mouthing off like I knew everything,\r\nand then I lost! How embarrassing!\c\nI probably should’ve trained my Pokémon up\na bit before trying a battle like that, huh?
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: Yes! I did it!\c\n...Oh!\nBut don’t worry about one little loss, OK?
Let’s battle again sometime!
OAK: Did you enjoy your first taste of battle,\nyoung [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nYour partner [VAR PKNAME(0002)] seemed to like it!

OAK: I’ll stop you right there, son!\nThose Berries are for Pokémon to eat, not you!\c\nWhen you want to catch a Pokémon, try throwing\none of those at your target before you take a\r\nPoké Ball in hand.\c\nYou’ll find that wild Pokémon will be so happy to\nhave a Berry to nibble on that they’ll become\r\nmuch easier for you to catch!
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: That was close...\nI nearly swallowed one of ’em right up myself!
OAK: Now then, you two!\c\nIt’s up to you to decide if you want to catch lots\nof different Pokémon or simply focus on training\r\nup your favorites.\c\nMy only request is that you have fun either way!
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: As for me...\nI wanna catch tons of different Pokémon!\c\nBut I wanna train them up to be strong,\ntoo! Heh!
OAK: I hope you get the chance to meet many\ndifferent Pokémon in your journeys!

Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Oh, just look at [VAR PKNAME(0002)]!\nYou two are already looking like great partners.
And I’ve got the perfect little gift for such\na great team! Here, take this.
Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
You got [VAR COLOR(0006)]Sportswear[VAR COLOR(0000)] from your friend’s big sister!
You put the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Sportswear[VAR COLOR(0000)] in your Clothing Trunk!

Try putting that on [VAR PKNAME(0002)].\nYou can go on an adventure in matching clothes!

Hee hee!\nIt seems like [VAR PKNAME(0002)] wants to play!\c\nDon’t forget to show it some love from time\nto time.

Well, since we’re on the topic...\c\nThe Pokémon you sent into battle might’ve lost\nsome HP or PP...
You should take ’em to a [VAR COLOR(0006)]Pokémon Center [VAR COLOR(0000)]and\nget them healed up!\c\nIt doesn’t cost any money and doesn’t take long\nat all, either.
Just remember—heal up after battles!

You hoping to make it to the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Pokémon League[VAR COLOR(0000)]\nsomeday, too?\c\nThat’s where you can battle the strongest\nof all Pokémon Trainers...\r\nThe ones they call the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Elite Four[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
I was hoping maybe I could get a glimpse of ’em,\nbut the guard at the gate wouldn’t even let me\r\npass without any Badges from Pokémon Gyms!
Guess I’ll just have to get there the long way:\nby battling and getting strong!\c\nSo, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nI guess that means it’s on!
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: Hmm...\nMaybe battling like this is just helping you get\r\nstronger, huh, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nOh well! That works, too!
Let’s train hard so that someday we both make\nit to the Pokémon League!

If you want to get stronger, you’ve definitely\ngotta try to take him on!
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: Hah! Jeez, [VAR PKNICK(0003)]!\nYou’re ready for a good battle, too, huh?\r\nWho wouldn’t be!\c\nAll right, then. You’re making me want to cheer\nyou guys on, too, so take these!
You got 5 Potions from [VAR TRNAME(0001)]!
I bought some for you with the prize money\nI’ve been earning in all my battles.\c\nBeat that Gym Leader, [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\nand you can really call yourself a true Trainer!\c\nGive it your best!

Ha, I knew it!\nI’m always right.
’Cause you look just like my gramps said.
BLUE: I’m Blue!\c\nI heard from my gramps that two new kids set\nout from Pallet Town to become Trainers,\r\njust like I did once.\r\nSo I came to check you out!
I was thinking you might want some advice on\nhow to beat the Gym from an expert Trainer like\r\nme, but looks like I showed up too late, huh?
Seems you’re not too shabby yourself...\nSo I guess you’ve earned a reward, newbie!
[~ 9]

You got 5 [VAR COLOR(0006)]Great Balls [VAR COLOR(0000)]from Blue!
BLUE: Those’ll be even better for catching\nPokémon than plain old Poké Balls.\c\nAnd hey, that thing you’ve got there...\nThat’s a Pokédex, right?\r\nSo Gramps finally went and made one!
He used to make me just scribble on a map with\na pencil about where I encountered Pokémon...
You’d better do a good job helping him out!\nHe may be Professor Oak to you, and sure,\r\nhe’s an old coot, but he’s still my gramps!\c\nSmell ya later, newbie!

You got the Helix Fossil!

That cruise ship, the S.S. Anne, pulls into port in\nVermilion City.\c\nThey invited me to some party on board, but I\ncan’t stand fancy gatherings.\c\nWhy don’t you go instead of me?\c\nThere are a couple of tickets in there, so have\nsome fun with a friend or something!

Seems like we can’t pass through the gate there.
But the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Underground Path[VAR COLOR(0000)] should take us to\n[VAR COLOR(0006)]Vermilion City[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nIt’s a bit dark and spooky, though...
Huh?
Hold still for one sec, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
I was wondering what the sparkly thing was.\nThis was stuck in your hair!
You got a Revive from [VAR TRNAME(0001)]!
Revives can heal Pokémon that have been\nknocked out in battle.\c\nI have a few extra, so...\nHere, take some of mine, too!
You got 2 Revives from [VAR TRNAME(0001)]!
Maybe those will help you when you take on\nthe next Gym!
...Huh? Are those S.S. Tickets you have?

I’ve got one extra, so...
No way! They’re for the S.S. Anne, right?\c\nI hear it’s a luxury cruise liner that’s traveled\nall over the world!\c\nMan, I’d love a chance to see what it’s like on\nthe inside, even just once...

[VAR 01CD(0001)]: Hey, Blue!
Are you taking a cruise?
BLUE: Not hardly.\c\nI got invited to the exclusive party for Trainers,\nbut I’m pretty much done with this scene.\c\nI got plenty of party favors, too.\nHere... I can even share one with you.
You got a [VAR COLOR(0006)]Shalour Sable[VAR COLOR(0000)] from Blue!
More importantly, though...\nyou wanna know what I overheard at the party?\c\nYou guys know about Team Rocket, right?
They’re the bad guys!
I battled them before...
BLUE: Yup. There are all kinds of rumors going\naround about the things they get up to.
BLUE: Seriously?\nYou must be fearless or something, kid.
Anyway, the point is this:\nTeam Rocket is a dangerous group, and they’re\r\ntrying to use Pokémon to make themselves rich.\c\nI might do some digging into what it is they’re\nreally after...\c\nAnd you two’d better stay out of their path!
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: Team Rocket, huh...\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], if you get tangled up with\nthose jerks again, you should call me!
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: Blue’s real strong.\c\nI heard he beat the Pokémon League’s Elite Four\nyears ago.\c\nAnd I heard he’s got a rival who even managed\nto beat him, too!\c\nHow strong would someone have to be to beat\nBlue in battle? I can’t even imagine it!

Hey, before you go to meet him, how about\nI take a look to see how well you’ve been\r\nraising your Pokémon, huh?

Well, color me surprised! I’ve traveled all over\nthis wide world, and this is the first time I’ve had\r\na Pokémon want to learn my Secret Technique...
But with spirit like that...\nWell then, who am I to say no?\c\nI’ll teach my special Secret Technique even to\nthat [VAR PKNAME(0002)] of yours!

Using Chop Down, your [VAR PKNAME(0002)] will be\nable to help you chop down thin trees.\c\nYou could go give it a try, uh... That’s right!\nHow about on the trees around Vermilion City?
CAPTAIN: Whew!\c\nNow I guess it’s about time for the S.S. Anne to\nset sail again!\c\nThis may be good-bye for now. Until the next\ntime we return to Vermilion City!

Naw, I’m fine by myself
All right! We’ll be there in no time.\nCome on!
So, just head east here from Cerulean City...
That’s this direction—got it?\c\nJust keep going this way, and you’ll eventually\nhit this cave system called the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Rock Tunnel[VAR COLOR(0000)].\c\nI hear it’s pitch dark!
If you use Light Up, though, you don’t have to\nbe scared of the dark!\c\nSee you around!
Really? Well, OK...\c\nYou sure you’ll be all right?
Yeah, I want to go alone
Actually, let’s go together

[VAR 01CD(0001)]: Aww, shoot!\nWhen we battled, we scared off that Cubone...\c\nYou know Cubone, right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\nIt’s a Pokémon that’s always wearing a skull!
That Cubone looked like it was searching\nfor something...\c\nMaybe it’s up on one of the higher floors...?

You were sent back to 1F!
Begone...\nintruders...

BROCK: Hey! I didn’t expect to run into\nyou here.
I’m on my way back from visiting the Celadon\nCity Gym.\c\nKeeping in touch with other Gym Leaders is\npart of our duties, after all!
The girls at that Gym all turned me away for\nsome reason, though...
Actually, have some Pewter Crunchies!\nI’d brought them as a gift to the Gym here.
You got Pewter Crunchies from Brock!
Oh, and you’re probably going to want some\ntea after eating them. Pewter Crunchies can\r\nmake you thirsty.
You got a cup of [VAR COLOR(0006)]Tea[VAR COLOR(0000)] from Brock!
Ah! I don’t have enough left to give to that\nthirsty guard now...
Anyway, it looks like you’ve been visiting\nthe Gyms in other cities! I wish you the best!

I’m on guard duty.\nAnd I take my duty very seriously.\r\nBut, gee, am I ever thirsty!\c\nI wish I had some [VAR COLOR(0006)]tea[VAR COLOR(0000)] to drink...
Oh, hold on there, kid.\nI’m afraid I can’t let you pass through here.
Oh, that tea you have...\nIt looks awfully tasty...
What? I can have a drink?\nGee, thanks!
*glug glug glug*\c\n*glug glug glug*\c\nWell... *glug glug*\c\nIf you really wanna go to Saffron City... *glug*\c\nI guess I can let you past... *glug glug* *gulp*
I’ll share this tea with the guards working\nthe other gates around the city, too.
Oh, you’re that kid...\nThanks again for before!
Oh dear, I think I gave that poor guard too many\nPewter Crunchies to eat...\c\nThey’re rather dry if you don’t have any tea or\nanything to wash them down...
There really is nothing like a hot cup of tea to\ngo with your Pewter Crunchies!

JESSIE: We came all the way to Lavender Town\non the boss’s orders, but...
Where in the world is this old man Fuji supposed\nto be?
JAMES: The only place left is that spooky old\nPokémon Tower, right?
JESSIE: That’s right... [VAR COLOR(0006)]We couldn’t get to the top[VAR COLOR(0000)]\nbecause of that [VAR COLOR(0006)]strange ghost[VAR COLOR(0000)] getting in the way.
JAMES: Well, we couldn’t find that old man, but\nat least we found this Cubone!\c\nLet’s get it back to our hideout. At least we’ll\nhave something to show for our trouble.
JESSIE: Right! Let’s head to the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Rocket[VAR COLOR(0000)]\n[VAR COLOR(0006)]Game Corner[VAR COLOR(0000)] in [VAR COLOR(0006)]Celadon City[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
CUBONE: Maaa?
JESSIE: Aww, does the wittle Cubone want its\nmommy? Your mommy’s in Celadon City.\c\nCome with us. We’ll take you there.
CUBONE: Maa! Maa!
Now that that’s decided, I think we’d better\nblast off!
I-I just saw something awful...
Hey, did you see?!\nTeam Rocket abducted that poor Cubone!
It sounded like they were headed to\n[VAR COLOR(0006)]Celadon City[VAR COLOR(0000)], but...
They must be planning on taking the skull bone\nit wears and selling it at a high price!
You rescued that Cubone from Team Rocket?!\nWow, that’s pretty amazing!
Take these, as a thank-you!
You got 20 Great Balls!
I bet someone brave like you could go up\nthe Pokémon Tower, no problem!
JESSIE: There! Come on! Almost got it...\nAaah, so close!
JAMES: C’mon, Jessie, why don’t we head to\nthe hideout now?
JESSIE: Oh come on, we’ve already handed over\nthe [VAR COLOR(0006)]Cubone[VAR COLOR(0000)] to another Team Rocket member.\r\nWhat’s the harm in taking a little break?\c\nHow were we supposed to open the [VAR COLOR(0006)]hidden[VAR COLOR(0000)]\n[VAR COLOR(0006)]entrance to the hideout[VAR COLOR(0000)], anyway?
JAMES: We just need to check the [VAR COLOR(0006)]poster[VAR COLOR(0000)] with\na [VAR COLOR(0006)]vehicle on it[VAR COLOR(0000)], remember?\c\nIt’s a poster with a [VAR COLOR(0006)]vehicle[VAR COLOR(0000)] that’s the best way to\n[VAR COLOR(0006)]represent us[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
JESSIE: What do you mean? What kind of\nvehicle is the best way to represent us?
JAMES: You know, those things that [VAR COLOR(0006)]blast off[VAR COLOR(0000)]\n[VAR COLOR(0006)]into space[VAR COLOR(0000)]?

I’m guarding this poster!\nGo away, or else!

At this rate, the location of the Team Rocket\nHideout is gonna be discovered!\c\nI better tell the boss!

Hahaha! What’s that?\nYou say the elevator doesn’t work?\c\nCourse not! I’ve been keeping the Lift Key safe\nthis whole time!

Gah! Now how am I supposed to keep you from\ntaking the Lift Key?!\c\nGuess I’ll have to use my own kind of Struggle!
I hope my bosses don’t hear about this!
Hah...hah... Phew!\c\nWithout that key, there’s no way you’ll make it\nto the boss!\c\nIf you think you can get it back from up there,\nthen I’d sure like to see you try! Haha!
There’s no way you’re getting that Lift Key now!\c\nNot unless you know some way to walk on top\nof the walls or something. ...Like that’d happen!
That Pokémon of yours looks pretty nimble,\nI gotta say...
You got the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Lift Key[VAR COLOR(0000)]!

It’s too high up...\nYou can’t reach it!
Pika?
Vee?
Maybe [VAR PKNICK(0003)] could reach it, if there\nwere some way to climb up there...
If there were a step stool or something, maybe it\nwould be possible to reach the top from here!
Look around and see if you can find something\nyou could climb up on!
This chair could probably be used as a step!
Up you go!
Pika!
Vee!
Now’s the time for your partner to shine!\nGet the key that the Team Rocket Grunt threw!
You look at [VAR PKNICK(0003)] with eyes full\nof trust!
Go through the wall to reach the pipes on\nthe other side!
???: Where did that Cubone come from, Boss?
CUBONE: Maa...
???: Two of my underlings decided to bring it\nhere, without my permission.
???: The skull on its head is very beautiful...\c\nWe should be able to sell it for a good price\nonce it becomes a Marowak.
???: ... ... ...
It looks like they’re talking about something\ncomplicated.
...Pika!
...Vee!
[VAR PKNICK(0003)] got the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Lift Key[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
JESSIE: Did you hear something just now?
JAMES: I did! There was definitely a noise!\nCould it be...an intruder?!
Pi...
Vee...
MEOWTH: Grrrrrr!
JAMES: ...Never mind.\nIt must’ve just been Meowth’s hungry tummy.
JESSIE: Don’t get me all worried over nothing!
JESSIE: The boss’s Persian is so elegant...
JAMES: And that Fake Out move it uses!\nIt always makes an opponent flinch in battle!\r\nIt’s strong AND cool...
JESSIE: Oh, did I tell you the news?\nMy Ekans! It evolved!
JAMES: Oh! Congratulations, Jessie! You know,\nmy Koffing evolved into Weezing, too!
JESSIE: You know that Admin named Archer?\c\nHe uses this Golbat, and it flapped past me in\nthe hall the other day...\c\nOooh, it gave me the creeps!
JAMES: Archer has a Weezing, too, doesn’t he?\c\nI wouldn’t have thought that he and I would\nhave the same tastes...
JESSIE: Guard duty sure is dull, isn’t it...?
JAMES: Sure is dull, yeah...
It’s a solid box, holding a fire extinguisher...\c\nBut it’s too heavy for you to move!
There’s something written on the papers...\n“Team Rocket’s Greatest-Ever Secret Plan!”
This chair is awfully rickety...\nIt doesn’t seem like you could move it.
[~ 40]
It’s a map of the Kanto region—and it’s covered\nwith notes about someone’s sinister plans!
This cardboard box is so heavy, you can’t lift it!
There’s a note on the wall, with a warning\nscrawled on it!\c\n“Please don’t let any Pokémon in the air vents!\nThey climb atop the walls and wreak havoc!”
[~ 44]
There’s an intercom with a video screen...\c\nBetter not touch it if we don’t know who might\nanswer at the other end!
[~ 46]
There’s a book lying on the table...\c\nDark Charisma: How You Too Can Become an\nEvil Mastermind!
[VAR PKNICK(0003)] came back to you!

To rescue Cubone
To join Team Rocket
JESSIE: What?! That Cubone?\nHa! We already gave the poor thing to the boss!
JESSIE: What? Really?!\nYou certainly do show potential. Though you’re\r\nnot nearly as beautiful as me...\c\nWait a minute—you’re trying to trick me!

Silph Co. definitely has the technology and\nskill Team Rocket will need to make our wishes\r\ncome true.

Yes, this could do.\c\nCarry on, Archer, with your plans to take over\nSilph Co. for Team Rocket.
???: Yes, sir!
What is a child doing here?
You listened in on our conversation without\nsaying a word?\r\nI don’t much care for that.
I am Archer, an Admin of Team Rocket.\c\nAnd I do not go easy even on children!

I must say—I am impressed you got here.
Team Rocket captures Pokémon from around\nthe world.\c\nThey’re important tools for keeping our criminal\nenterprise going.
And I am the leader of this enterprise...Giovanni!
...What? You want me to release the Cubone?
CUBONE: Maaa maaa!
GIOVANNI: Fwahahahaha!
You came barging into our hideout just for that?
What an amusing child.
But...\nFor your insolence, you will feel a world of pain!
[~ 10]
GIOVANNI: So I too am defeated by a child...
Do as you wish with that Cubone.
CUBONE: Maaa!
And take this.\nAs my apology for mocking you as a child.
Giovanni handed you the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Silph Scope[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
...I can see you raise Pokémon with utmost care.
But you would never understand what\nI hope to achieve.
... ... ...\nI shall step aside this time!
But I hope we will meet and battle again!
CUBONE: Maaa maff!
Cubone headed back to [VAR COLOR(0006)]Lavender Town[VAR COLOR(0000)].
Maybe with the Silph Scope, you’ll be able to\nfind out the identity of that [VAR COLOR(0006)]ghost[VAR COLOR(0000)]...?

[VAR 01CD(0001)]: Me neither!\c\nI saw Cubone heading into the tower a little\nwhile ago, too...\c\nI’ll go look for it—and I’ll keep an eye out for\nthat Mr. Fuji, too! The one who’s been missing!

The mother’s spirit was calmed, returning to its\nkind and gentle nature.\c\nIt departed to the afterlife...and disappeared.

Well, Team Rocket...

That’s right!
What do we do?
BLUE: Come on!\nIt’s time we did a little strategy planning!
BLUE: We do whatever we can do!
BLUE: ...So in short, the plan is this:\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)] is gonna drive Team Rocket\nout of Silph Co., just like [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0100)]she planned.\c\nBut it’d be crazy to try something like that alone,\nso [VAR TRNAME(0001)] is going with h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imer.
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: Right!
BLUE: While you pip-squeaks do that, I’m gonna\ndo a loop around all of Kanto, squashing out\r\nTeam Rocket wherever I find ’em!\c\nOne of us is sure to find out where\ntheir boss is hiding.
And while I’m at it, I’ll swing by the Pokémon\nLeague to tell the bigwigs there what’s going on.

...Heh. If only it were that simple.\c\nFact is, there’s one more thing we’ve gotta do\nhere first.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! [VAR TRNAME(0001)]!\nIf you want me to leave this place up to you two\r\nnewbies, then prove that you’re up to the task!
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: What?!
BLUE: I don’t care who goes first, so show me\nwhat you’ve got!
BLUE: Hey now! You lost or something?\nI’m standing right here!
RECEPTIONIST: Have you come to save\nSilph Co. from those criminals?\c\nIf you’re friends with a famous Trainer like Blue,\nthen I’m sure we can rely on you.
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: If I can beat Blue, then I can\ngo get revenge for Marowak...\r\nThat’s right! I think maybe I can really do this!\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you wanna go first?

[VAR 01CD(0001)]: Go, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nThis is our best chance to beat their boss!
Old man, you’ll be dealing with me!
ARCHER: Ugh!\nI don’t have time for this! I must warn the boss!
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: [VAR TRNAME(0000)], go!\c\nGo beat the Team Rocket boss once and for all!

GIOVANNI: Now, now, Mr. President.\nI hope you’re not thinking of lying to me.
The Master Ball...\c\nYou successfully created one, didn’t you!
PRESIDENT: Do you think it’s that easy\nto make?
And now that I know who you really are, there\nis no way I want to make a thing like that...\r\nNot for someone like you!
GIOVANNI: How dare you?!
PRESIDENT: And give up any thought of forcing\nus to create lots of powerful Pokémon for you!
Using stolen research to create Pokémon...\nThat’s not something Silph should ever do.
GIOVANNI: We had a deal! You agreed to this!
...You’re a smart man. I’m sure you can imagine\nwhat will happen to your people if you say no\r\nto me now.
PRESIDENT: ...
GIOVANNI: Ah. Young [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\nSo we meet again!\c\nThe president of Silph and I are discussing\na vital business proposition.\c\nKeep your nose out of grown-up matters...
Or experience a world of pain!
[~ 12]
GIOVANNI: Blast... I have little choice, it seems.\nI will relinquish Silph for now.
But Team Rocket will never fall!
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! Never forget...
All Pokémon exist for Team Rocket’s use!
I may leave you now, but we will meet again!

PRESIDENT: Oh, dear girl!\nThank you for saving us here at Silph!
Pika pika!
Vee vee!
Wahaha! I suppose that’s so. It wasn’t just you—\nit was that wonderful partner of yours, too!
I will never forget how you saved us in our\nmoment of peril.
I have to thank you in some way. And I’m quite\nmagnanimous, so I can give you anything.\c\nHere, maybe this will do?
You got the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Master Ball[VAR COLOR(0000)] from the president!
PRESIDENT: You can’t buy that anywhere.\nIt’s our secret prototype, the Master Ball.
It will catch any Pokémon without fail!\nTruthfully, we’ve only succeeded in making\r\njust the one.
So you should probably be quiet about using it.
PRESIDENT: Ah! Our saviors!\nThank you again for saving Silph Co. for us!
PRESIDENT: Oh! Wait for a moment! Please let\nme reward you!
[~ 13]
SECRETARY: Thank you for rescuing all of us.\c\nWe, from the president on down, are indebted\nto you for what you did.
SECRETARY: A Poké Ball that can catch any\nPokémon without fail...\c\nIt’s not something to be given to just any\nordinary Trainer. That’s why the president\r\nentrusted it to you.

[VAR 01CD(0001)]: [VAR TRNAME(0000)], you did it!\nYou beat Giovanni, right?
That Archer guy made a run for it, so I chased\nhim all the way out here, and then...\c\nall the Team Rocket Grunts ran right outta\nSaffron City, too!
Guess we’re lucky you’re such a strong\nTrainer, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
To be honest, I was a little scared.\c\nLike, what would have happened to us if it\nturned out the bad guys were the strongest,\r\nyou know?
But you and me, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nWe really managed to save Silph!\c\nNobody will have to go through what Cubone\nwent through ever again!
All right! Now that everything’s back to normal,\nI guess it’s time for the next Pokémon Gym!\c\nHave you been to the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Saffron City Gym[VAR COLOR(0000)]\nalready, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nHow many Badges have you got?\c\n...That many, huh? Wow.
Maybe we’ll both make it all the way to\nthe Pokémon League!
Let’s both give it our best shot!\nSee ya!

This Lapras is getting on in age, but it’s still\na real beauty, wouldn’t you say?
We used to ride on waves and travel the whole\nwide world together!
LAPRAS: Splaaash!
Lapras can’t swim like it used to...\c\nSo we’ll stay here together.
Thank you for listening.
As thanks, I’ll teach you the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Secret Technique[VAR COLOR(0000)]\n[VAR COLOR(0006)]Sea Skim[VAR COLOR(0000)].\r\nWith this technique, you can travel on water!
Haha! Your [VAR PKNAME(0002)] wants to learn it\nas well?
I’m not sure if it can learn it.\nIt’s not Water type...
Pikapi!
Eeeveee!
You look determined, just like my Lapras!
OK! I’ll teach you the technique, then!
Pikapi!
Veee!
...Now, you have to keep balance on the water!\c\nLower the center of gravity, and keep balance\nwith your upper body!
[VAR PKNICK(0003)] learned the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Secret Technique[VAR COLOR(0000)]\n[VAR COLOR(0006)]Sea Skim[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
You did great!\c\nI’ll give you that board, too!
Ride waves and travel the whole wide\nworld together!

[VAR 01CD(0001)]: Ah! So this is where you were!
I thought you might have made your way to\nCinnabar Island by now.
Did you beat Blaine?\nReally? Congratulations!
You need to have [VAR COLOR(0006)]eight[VAR COLOR(0000)] Gym Badges to get into\nthe Pokémon League, right?
I’ve got seven already! Which means that the\nonly one left is...
Yeah! It must be the Gym in [VAR COLOR(0006)]Viridian City[VAR COLOR(0000)], right?\nIt was closed up last time I checked, though.
Have you been in the Viridian City Gym\nyet, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\r\nYou haven’t, right?
I guess I’ll try stopping by Viridian City one\nmore time.

Well, never mind that!\nSo, how many Gym Badges you got these days?
...S-seven?!\nThen it looks like we’re even!\c\nAll that’s left now is the Viridian City Gym...\nSame for you, right?\r\nBut this place is never open...
I guess we’ve gotta tell someone that we haven’t\nbeen able to get into the Gym...\r\nBut who should we talk to?
Professor Oak
[VAR PKNAME(0003)]
That old man there
OLD MAN: What?! Me?!\nI don’t know anything about a thing like that...
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: O-of course you wouldn’t!\nSorry about that... We’ll think it over ourselves!
Yeah, that’s what I was thinking, too.\nLet’s go see if he knows anything!
Piiika! Pika pika!

You two are both looking a lot more grown up\nthan the last time I saw you.
And you have impeccable timing, as usual!\nLet me introduce you.
This is my grandson.\c\n...Erm, what was his name, now?
BLUE: Gramps, no one ever laughs at that joke!\nWould you give it a break?\c\nAnd besides, we’ve already met!
OAK: My own grandson...\nYou’re no fun...
BLUE: Yeah, yeah. Sure, Gramps.\nMore important than that, though...
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! [VAR TRNAME(0001)]!\nYou two did awesome!
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: Huh?
BLUE: With Team Rocket!\c\nI never thought that their boss would actually\nbe holed up there at Silph Co.!
And the two of you managed to take him down!
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: No, it wasn’t me!\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)] beat Giovanni all by h[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0202)]imerself!\c\nAll I did was help out a bit...
[~ 12]
[~ 13]
[~ 14]
BLUE: So what? You and your Pokémon did your\nbest, too, right, [VAR TRNAME(0001)]?
So I’ve got a little something for you two!\nAs a reward for your hard work.
[~ 17]
[~ 18]
[~ 19]
You got a [VAR COLOR(0006)]Key Stone[VAR COLOR(0000)] from Blue!
OAK: Oooh!\nIsn’t that a Key Stone?\c\nA stone that can trigger an Evolution that\ntranscends all other Evolutions—[VAR COLOR(0006)]Mega Evolution[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: Mega Evolution?!\nWhat’s that?!
OAK: If you have both a Key Stone and the right\n[VAR COLOR(0006)]Mega Stone[VAR COLOR(0000)]...\c\nyou can make a Pokémon [VAR COLOR(0006)]Mega Evolve [VAR COLOR(0000)]in battle!\nJust one time per battle, though!
Your Pokémon will get all powered up to battle\nhard for you!\c\nMega Evolution is proof of the [VAR COLOR(0006)]strong bond[VAR COLOR(0000)]\nbetween a Pokémon and its Trainer!
Er-hem. A brief poem, if I may...\c\n“When two stones are held...\nWhen two hearts become as one...\r\nWe Mega Evolve...”
BLUE: The two of you should be able to use\nthese well! These are Mega Stones!
You got a [VAR COLOR(0006)]Venusaurite[VAR COLOR(0000)], a [VAR COLOR(0006)]Charizardite X[VAR COLOR(0000)],\na [VAR COLOR(0006)]Charizardite Y[VAR COLOR(0000)], and a [VAR COLOR(0006)]Blastoisinite[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
You’re gonna take on the Pokémon League,\naren’t you? Give these a try when you do!
BLUE: Oh. But what’re you even doing back here\nin Pallet Town?\c\n...What?\nViridian City’s Gym Leader is never at the Gym?\c\nHuh, that’s odd...\nMaybe I’ll go take a look myself...
OAK: You two are so close to\nthe Pokémon League now.\r\nJust one last push!
[~ 31]
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: Mega Evolution...\nMan, if Team Rocket had used a thing like that,\r\nthey’d have been an even bigger pain!
I’ve heard there are many other kinds of\nMega Stones in the world, as well.
Mega Evolution is pretty rare here in Kanto!
Pallet Town may be small, but plenty of strong\nTrainers have come from here.\r\nI’d guess the professor must be pretty proud!

But it’s a secret!\nYou won’t tell anyone, right, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?
Oh! That’s right!\nUm...\c\nThe Viridian City Gym Leader came back to\nthe Gym at last! That’s what people are saying.\c\nYou should head off to Viridian City!
You can’t tell [VAR TRNAME(0001)] that you saw me\npicking flowers here, OK?\r\nIt’s our little secret!

BLUE: Congrats, kid!\c\nBoy, though, what a shock...
I never thought a criminal would use\na Pokémon Gym as their hideout...\r\n... ... ...\c\nThat’s it! I’ve decided!
I’ll look after the Viridian City Gym from now on!\c\nI don’t really like to get tied down, so I’ve\nalways said no when they ask about it, but...\c\nI’m finally ready.\nI’ll be the Gym Leader from now on.
That’s great!
I want to battle you!
Thanks!\c\nWith an awesome Trainer like me around, I’m\npretty sure the Kanto region’ll be safe from\r\ntroublemakers like Team Rocket forever!
Huh? I mean, sure, but I think you’ve got\na bigger challenge to face right now.
So then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nTime for you to take on the [VAR COLOR(0006)]Pokémon League[VAR COLOR(0000)]!\c\nJust keep going along Route 22 to the west of\nhere, and you won’t miss it.\c\nThe Elite Four are tough opponents, but\ndon’t you dare lose!
BLUE: The first challenger I’ll have here...\nI’m sure it’s gonna be [VAR TRNAME(0001)]!\c\nI’m gonna show that little upstart how it’s done!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[VAR 01CD(0001)]: [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
I finally caught up to you!\c\nI got an Earth Badge, too!\c\nThat means we can finally get into\nthe Pokémon League!
I heard the Elite Four are incredibly strong...\nBut there’s no turning back now, right?
You think you’re ready, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]?\c\nShow me the Pokémon you’ve raised!
You know, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...\nI’ve always felt like I needed to look after you,\r\never since we were young.\c\nBut I think... I think you’re the one who has\nmore talent as a Trainer.
It’s...frustrating.\nI’ve never felt this way before.\c\nIs this what makes it fun to raise Pokémon?
Whatever it is, I know I don’t want to lose again!
It’s weird to even have to ask, but...\nlet me go on ahead first!

OAK: [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
So, you’ve done it at last!\nYou’ve defeated the Pokémon League!\r\nMy sincerest congratulations!
You’ve grown a great deal since you first caught\n[VAR PKNAME(0002)] and set out with that Pokédex.
Yes, [VAR TRNAME(0000)], you’ve really come into\nyour own as a fine young [VAR GENDBR(00FF,0200)]woman!
And [VAR TRNAME(0001)]!\nYou showed great resolve, never losing heart\r\nas you saw your journey through to the end!
I did see, though, in the way that you do battle...\c\nThat kind heart of yours might still be causing\nyou to hold yourself back when it comes to your\r\nPokémon and to facing [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nIt’s hardly much of a weakness, but it may have\ncost you the battle this time.
Regardless, the two of you showed us an\nextraordinary battle!

OAK: [VAR TRNAME(0000)].\c\nYou understand that your victory was not just\nyour own doing, don’t you?\c\nIt was the marvelous bond you share with your\nPokémon that brought you here.\c\nNow, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nCome with me!
[VAR 01CD(0001)]: Man, you truly are something!\nBut that doesn’t mean I’m giving up!\c\nI’ll keep taking on the challenge to be\nthe Champion as many times as it takes!
OAK: [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
Congratulations on another victory over\nthe Pokémon League!\c\nDefending your seat as Champion is certainly\nno easy feat.\c\nSuch an effort should be celebrated!\nFollow me!

But don’t get too comfortable with that title.\nI plan on stealing it from you soon!
First, though... Did you hear the rumors?\c\nThere’s talk going around about some crazy\nstrong-looking Pokémon being spotted...
What kind of Pokémon?
I want to catch it!
I hear it looks super strong—and super cool!
Ha! I knew you wouldn’t be able to resist a\nrumor like that!
The Pokémon was seen near [VAR COLOR(0006)]Cerulean City[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
And apparently it ran away into a cave\nsomewhere there. That’s all I know.
So! I say we both go try to catch this Pokémon!

Hey, sorry to bug you while your\nworld’s expanding.
Remember me?\nI’m Ronny from Route 1.
Now that you’ve successfully become Champion,\nI’ve got some news for you!
The [VAR COLOR(0006)]Master Trainers[VAR COLOR(0000)]—Trainers that have spent\ntheir whole careers training one specific\r\nPokémon—have appeared throughout Kanto.
I’d say challenging the Pikachu Master is a good\nplace to start.\c\nHead to Viridian Forest if you want to face her!
I’d say challenging the Eevee Master is a good\nplace to start.\c\nHead to Pokémon Road if you want to face her!

The Master Trainers have each focused on\ntraining one species of Pokémon.\c\nThey’re always thinking about the Pokémon\nthey’ve spent all that time with, so you should\r\nbe able to find them pretty easily.
If you have the same species of Pokémon as\nthem, you’ll be able to battle them, one-on-one.\c\nNeither side will be allowed to use items, so it\nwill be a battle of pure skill!\c\nIf you win, you’ll receive a title and you’ll be\nable to use it from that point on.
You can change the title you’re using at\nthe game company in Celadon City.\c\nShow it off during Link Battles!
Good luck!

BROCK: So, you’re here.\nI’m Brock, Pewter City’s Gym Leader.
You can see just by looking at my Pokémon how\nrock hard my willpower is.\c\nMy Pokémon are all hard as rock and have true-\ngrit determination!
That’s right! My Pokémon are all Rock types!
Fwahaha! You’re going to challenge me even\nknowing that you’ll lose?\c\nThat’s what a Trainer’s honor demands!
So be it!\nShow me your best!

There are all kinds of people in this huge world\nof ours.\c\nSome have their Pokémon battle—some just like\nto raise them...\c\nI’m hard at work here to learn how to become\na Pokémon Breeder, who helps raise Pokémon.\c\nYou’re aiming to become a strong Trainer, right?\nThen you should challenge all the other Gyms!
You’re a Trainer, right?\c\nBrock’s looking for new challengers. Follow me!
If you think you’ve got the right stuff, you should\ntake on Brock!
Oh, wow, that’s a Boulder Badge!\nYou got it from Brock, didn’t you?\c\nWhen you get new Gym Badges, more items\nbecome available to you in the Poké Mart!
By the way, the Poké Mart is that blue building!

Hiya!\nYou’re here to challenge the Gym, aren’t you?\c\nI’m not a Trainer, but I can tell if you’re worthy\nof challenging the Gym Leader.\c\nNow, let’s get started...
The Pewter City Gym only allows Trainers who\nknow [VAR COLOR(0006)]type matchups[VAR COLOR(0000)] to enter!\c\nThere are a few types that have an advantage\nagainst the Gym Leader’s [VAR COLOR(0006)]Rock-type[VAR COLOR(0000)] Pokémon.\c\nBut for Trainers who have never challenged a\nGym before, we have them use either [VAR COLOR(0006)]Grass- [VAR COLOR(0000)]or\r\n[VAR COLOR(0006)]Water-type[VAR COLOR(0000)] Pokémon!

[VAR TRNAME(0000)]! You did it!\nYou beat that firebrand!
BLAINE: What d’you say?\nReady to start?
All righty, then!
No need to be shy, then. Step right up!
BLAINE: Here we go!\nThis is the Cinnabar Island Gym Pokémon Quiz!
Challengers get asked five questions that they\nhave to answer.\c\nGet one right, and you get a Blaine doll!
Get a question wrong, and you’ll have to battle\none of my students here.\c\nBut if you manage to beat them...then don’t\nworry—you still get a Blaine doll!\c\nThink you can collect five Blaine dolls?!
BLAINE: Here we go!\nThe first question!

[~ 64]
I look forward to more heated battles and\nsizzling quizzes today!
What a fantastic battle! Even I was heating up!
You think there are any other Fire-type\nGym Leaders out there?
You’re pretty tough. Ever thought about\nbecoming a Gym Leader?
Blaine’s not very good as an emcee, but he’s\nred hot when it comes to battles!
You and Blaine did great!
Blaine’s always thinking up ways to keep\nthe families of the scientists who live here from\r\ngetting bored.
Hahaha! Blaine’s so funny!
I sure would like a Blaine doll...
There’s not too much to get excited about\nhere on Cinnabar Island.
Recently there’s been a lot of strong challengers,\nso things have been pretty lively.
Good luck out there, Trainer!
Your [VAR PKNAME(0002)] looked so cute while\nyou were taking the quiz!
I’m not a Trainer, but I still enjoy watching Blaine!
I finally got one of Blaine’s questions right!
Do you know how hot Pokémon\nfire breath can get?
[~ 81]
You see, fire starts when... ... ...but to be more\nprecise, it’s really combustion... ... ...and then\r\nthe oxygen in the air... ... ...and after that it...\c\nHey! Hey! Are you listening to me?
I used to be a thief, but I went straight.
[~ 84]
I get this uncontrollable urge to steal other\npeople’s Pokémon.
Do you know why Blaine became a Trainer?
[~ 87]
Blaine got lost in the mountains while hiking.\nWhen night fell, a fiery bird Pokémon appeared.\c\nIts light allowed Blaine to find his way down\nto safety.
I’ve been to many Gyms, but this one best suits\nmy style.

...Well then, allow me to reintroduce myself.\nI am Lorelei of the Elite Four.
No one can best me when it comes\nto icy Pokémon.
Freezing moves are powerful. Your Pokémon will\nbe at my mercy when they are frozen solid.
That’s because frozen Pokémon can’t do\na thing in battle!

You likely know that dragons are Pokémon\nspoken of in legends!
They’re hard to catch and raise, but their powers\nare superior!
They’re virtually indestructible! There’s no being\nclever with them.
Well, are you ready to lose?
Your Pokémon League challenge ends with me,\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!

...Or, you would have been, but you have one\nmore challenge left.\c\nThere is one more Trainer to face!
That Trainer is—
OAK: Hello there, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nCongratulations on your victory over Lance!
Hm? What’s with that look of surprise?
LANCE: Haha... Your timing is perfect, Professor.
[VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nThe one you will face is...
Professor Oak!
Well, not really.
It’s [VAR TRNAME(0001)]!\c\nHe beat the Elite Four before you.
He is the Pokémon League Champion.
OAK: That’s right!
In the past, Trainers who defeated the Elite Four\nwere only recorded as [VAR COLOR(0006)]Champions[VAR COLOR(0000)].
This time, however, we’ll be officially\nestablishing the Champion as a part of\r\nthe Pokémon League!
LANCE: Professor Oak is here to officiate\nthe crowning of the new Champion.
It seems only fitting that it should be either\nyou or [VAR TRNAME(0001)]!\c\nYou’re the two who took care of Team Rocket,\nafter all!
LANCE: Now then, head onward to the stage\nof your final battle!
OAK: I look forward to seeing just how high\nthe two of you and your Pokémon can climb!
LANCE: I’m glad you’ve come.\c\nThe newly updated Pokémon League’s reputation\nhas really taken off!\r\nIt’s all thanks to you.
I’d feel ashamed to call myself Lance the dragon\nTrainer if I didn’t challenge you to a battle!
LANCE: There’s no way my dragon brigade\nis weak.\c\n...What I’m saying is that means your strength\nis truly incredible!
Now then, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nYou already know what’s next, don’t you?
That’s right, Champion. Your final challenger\nawaits you on the stage of your final battle!

Many Pokémon live only in forests and caves.\c\nYou need to be persistent and look everywhere\nto get different species.
Have you noticed the [VAR COLOR(0006)]skinny trees[VAR COLOR(0000)] on\nthe roadside?\c\nThey can be chopped down with the Secret\nTechnique called Chop Down, I hear.
The higher a Pokémon’s [VAR COLOR(0006)]CP[VAR COLOR(0000)] is, the higher its\nCombat Power is!\c\nI hear CP is a value made up of various stats\nand things combined.

When you try to catch a Pokémon, yeah?\nYou sometimes see a green ring, yeah?\r\nThat kind of Pokémon is easy to catch, yeah.\c\nIf the ring’s yellow, it’ll be a bit harder. Yeah.\c\nAnd if it’s a red ring, yeah, that Pokémon\nmight be really hard to catch!

If you leave that Pokémon at the Pokémon Day\nCare, you won’t have enough to battle!\c\nWhy don’t you try catching some more Pokémon\nand adding them to your party first?
You can’t leave any Pokémon unless you have at\nleast three across your party and Pokémon Box.\c\nWhy don’t you try catching some more Pokémon\nand adding them to your party first?

But that Pokémon is already so awesome that it\ndoesn’t need any training!
Which one of its stats do you want to do some\nHyper Training on?
Will you exchange a Bottle Cap to train\n[VAR PKNICK(0000)]’s [VAR EVSTAT(0001)]?
Will you exchange a Gold Bottle Cap to train\nall of [VAR PKNICK(0000)]’s stats?

Only skilled Trainers can collect Gym Badges.\c\nI see you have at least one.\c\nMay I tell you some interesting little bits of\ntrivia about those Badges?
Now then...\c\nWhich of the eight Badges should I describe?
Boulder Badge
Cascade Badge
Thunder Badge
Rainbow Badge
Soul Badge
Marsh Badge
Volcano Badge
Earth Badge
Number of Badges
Never mind
Come visit me anytime you wish.
It proves a person defeated the Pewter City\nGym Leader.\c\nThe creator of the Badge clearly put some effort\ninto it.\c\nIt’s rough and hard, just like Rock-type Pokémon!
It proves a person defeated the Cerulean City\nGym Leader.\c\nIf you look at it, you’ll see its elegant shape! It\nwas made to look just like a water drop.\c\nWatch out for the pointy end, though—it’s a\nbit sharp.
It proves a person defeated the Vermilion City\nGym Leader.\c\nYou may have never heard the word before, but\nvermilion is actually the name of a color.\c\nIt’s a reddish orange, although for some reason\nthe Badge itself doesn’t have this color...
It proves a person defeated the Celadon City\nGym Leader.\c\nThis is the most colorful of all the Badges here\nin the Kanto region, and it’s also the most\r\nexpensive to make.\c\nIf you put it on the ground and spin it like a top,\nit’s very pretty!
It proves a person defeated the Fuchsia City\nGym Leader.\c\nIt has been ranked as the best Badge to give\nas an engagement gift, two years straight.\c\nI’m guessing that’s because it’s shaped like a\nheart and is such a pretty pink color.
It proves a person defeated the Saffron City\nGym Leader.\c\nYou know, Trainers still debate whether it’s\nactually made out of real gold or not.
It proves a person defeated the Cinnabar Island\nGym Leader.\c\nThis Badge is actually made from rock that was\nformed from lava from the volcano in Cinnabar.\c\nThe Gym Leader was very particular about that.
It proves a person defeated the Viridian City\nGym Leader.\c\nI’ve heard this is the most difficult to obtain\nof all the eight Badges.
Strong Pokémon from other Trainers will listen\nto you if you have enough Badges!\c\nThe level limit increases by 10 levels for each\nBadge you have.\c\nIf you have one Badge, Pokémon up to Lv. 20\nwill listen to you...if you have two Badges,\r\nPokémon up to Lv. 30 will listen to you...\r\nand so on.\c\nOnce you have all the Badges, Pokémon of any\nlevel will give you their full attention!

A Pokémon is sprawled out in\na deep and comfortable slumber.
Do you want to use the Poké Flute?
You played the Poké Flute.
Snorlax woke up!
Snorlax is looking at you...\nAnd it looks hungry!
???: Hey, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
MR. FUJI: There’s something I forgot to mention\nwhen I gave you the Poké Flute...
...Oh! Perfect timing!
You see, this Pokémon is called Snorlax.\c\nIt’s been known to attack the first thing it sees\nafter waking up. It thinks what it sees is food!
Since it can be pretty dangerous, please help\nit calm down by battling it with your Pokémon.
Once you defeat it, it’ll become more docile.\nYou should be able to catch it, just like\r\nany other Pokémon!
Snorlax mistook you for food and attacked!
Snorlax calmed down.\nIt gave a huge yawn...\r\nand returned to the mountains.
MR. FUJI: Oh my, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!\nThat was impressive!
MR. FUJI: Oh, too bad, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]...
There are other Pokémon out there that will\ntry to attack Trainers, just as Snorlax did.\c\nWhen facing such a Pokémon, the best thing to\ndo is to defeat it, then catch it.\c\nRemember—defeat, then catch. In that order!
Well, I’ll see you later, then!

I’m not good at raising Pokémon.\c\nI feel sorry for my Charmander because it’s not\ngetting stronger.\c\nSo I want to give it to a better Trainer\nthan me. Are you interested?
The number of Pokémon you’ve caught\nis [VAR NUM9(0000,002C)]!
Cool! I want you to have this Charmander.\nWill you take it?
Take good care of my Charmander!
I’ve caught [VAR NUM3(0000)] Pokémon.\nYou should catch more than that!
Oh... I’d better send it to the professor, then.
How’s Charmander doing?
CHARMANDER: Chaaar!

I just caught a Squirtle that was always getting\ninto mischief.\c\nI think it needs a good Trainer to set it straight.
Wow, you’ve caught [VAR NUM9(0000,002C)] Pokémon!
You must be a great Trainer!\c\nI have a favor to ask you. Would you take care\nof this troublesome Squirtle?
OK! Please take good care of Squirtle!
How about I talk to you about it when you’ve\ncaught at least [VAR NUM3(0000)] Pokémon...
Oh... What am I to do now?
How is Squirtle doing?
SQUIRTLE: Squirt.

What could you possibly want, coming back\nhere now?\r\nBecause of you, Team Rocket was disbanded...
It’s not my style to be emotional, but I\nwanted to give you a glimpse of how I felt.
...\nNever mind.
To tell you the truth...\c\nI thought you might show up, so I was writing\na letter to you.
Let me read it.
“Dear [VAR TRNAME(0000)],\c\n“Congratulations on conquering\nthe Pokémon League.\c\n“I hold no grudges against you for what you did\nto Team Rocket.\c\n“Instead, using this defeat as a springboard,\nI would like to create an even stronger\r\nTeam Rocket and officially announce\r\nour comeback.\c\n“I will leave the Kanto region.\nI wish for your continued success here in Kanto.\c\n“Farewell.\n                                             Archer”
ARCHER: What did I want you to think about me\nby writing such a letter...?\r\nHumph.

Oh!\nWait, don’t tell me...
You already caught that superstrong Pokémon,\ndidn’t you?\c\nI knew it!\nSo, it’s called Mewtwo, huh?
Man, you got to Mewtwo before me or that girl!
Huh? Oh, I ran into this gutsy girl who said she\nwas looking for a powerful Pokémon.\c\nI think she meant Mewtwo.
Well, I guess that’s that...\c\nHere, take these. I won’t need ’em now!
You got 3 Escape Ropes\nfrom [VAR TRNAME(0001)]!
I just saw that girl come in here, too.\nShe must still be looking for Mewtwo.\c\nYou should go show it to her!
Ow!\c\nYou were hit by a low-flying Poké Ball!
???: Oh, whoops!\nYou’re not a Pokémon!
Sorry, it’s so dark in here, I saw you and thought\nyou were some kind of Pokémon.
GREEN: Well, uh...\nNice to meet you. I’m Green!
So, hey, I’m just curious...\nAre you here because you’re also looking for...\r\ny’know, something special?
R-right! Mewtwo!
...Drat, so you knew about it already, huh.
... ... ...
Whaaaaaaaaaat?!\nYou’ve already caught it?!
Hey, no fair!\nI was planning on catching it first!
Wow, you’re strong!\c\nWell, I guess that’s that.\nHere, you can have these.
You got a [VAR COLOR(0006)]Mewtwonite X[VAR COLOR(0000)] and a [VAR COLOR(0006)]Mewtwonite Y[VAR COLOR(0000)]!
Oh, I know!\c\nWhy don’t you become one of my Pokémon,\ntogether with Mewtwo?
A Poké Ball came flying at you!
GREEN: Hee hee hee...
Think about it, OK?
GREEN: Drat, I couldn’t catch you this time\neither, huh...
Well, never mind.\nJust show me how strong you’ve gotten!
Wow, I think you’re plenty strong already!\c\nSo, what do you say? Don’t you think it’s time\nyou become one of my Pokémon?\c\nAlong with Mewtwo, of course!
I’m not going to give up, you know!

My bike collection is impressive, isn’t it?\c\nI won’t let you ride or buy one, but feel free\nto have a look.
It’s a shiny bike.\nIt looks expensive!
Are you curious about that bike?
I like simple bikes, too.\nIt was a limited edition and popular a while ago.
The refreshing color of the frame\nperfectly matches nature!
It costs 1,000,000! Bike enthusiasts\nare tormented by its super rarity!
Although its performance is average,\nit’s super easy to ride.
It’s even easy for beginners to ride!
OK...
It’s a shiny bike.\nIt looks very fast!
Are you curious about those Mach Bikes?
As its name suggests, a Mach Bike is super fast.
The frame in pursuit of lightness!\nUltimate reduced air resistance!
If you put weight on the carbon handlebars,\nit accelerates to top speed in a second!
With the momentum, you can climb any hills\nwith ease!
It’s a bit difficult to control, but even that\nis a lovable feature of the bike.
It’s a shiny bike.\nIt looks tough!
Are you curious about those Acro Bikes?
It’s by far the wildest bike and very different\nfrom other bikes.\r\nThat is the Acro Bike!
It allows you to perform actions such as\nwheelies and bunny hops.
You can even ride it on raised walkways or\ntrackless paths!
You can do acrobatic stuff, so it’s called an\nAcro Bike. That is my own theory, though.
If you value techniques more than anything else,\nthat is the bike for you!
You’re the first person who listened to all of my\nnerdy talk.
You must be a nerd, too!\nAs a token of our new friendship, please\r\ntake this!
My bike collection...\n...Oh, it’s you!\c\nYou can look at my bikes as long as you want!

OAK: Good to see you!\nAnd how is your Pokédex coming along?\c\nHere, let me take a look...
Your current progress on your Pokédex is...\c\n[VAR NUM3(0004)] Pokémon seen and [VAR NUM3(0005)] Pokémon caught!\nAnd Professor Oak’s judgment is...
You’re just getting started.\c\nGo into every patch of grass you see and look\nfor Pokémon!
It looks as though you’re getting\non the right track!\c\nI’d bet you’re getting better at throwing out\nthe ol’ Poké Balls, too, eh?
Your Pokédex still needs a lot of filling before it\ncan really be called a true Pokédex!\c\nAlways look out for new places to explore!
Mm-hmm... It’s clear you’re trying hard!\c\nI’ve told one of my assistants to set you up with\nthe Judge function. He’s waiting at the gate on\r\nRoute 11, so be sure to get it from him!
Your Pokédex is coming along quite well!\c\nI gave an assistant a Poké Ball set for you.\nHe’s waiting at the gate on Route 16, so be sure\r\nto get it from him!
Ah, you’ve finally topped 50 species!\c\nI’ve given one of my assistants a wonderful item.\nHe’s waiting at the gate on Route 15, so be sure\r\nto get it from him!
Hoho! This is turning into quite the respectable\nPokédex, I’d say!
Very good! You can find Water-type Pokémon\nin rivers and the ocean, so use Sea Skim if you\r\nwant to catch them!
Wonderful! Let me guess...\nYou like to collect things, don’t you?
Now this... This is truly impressive!\nIt must have been difficult to collect so many!
You’ve finally hit 100 species!\nSuch skill! It’s hard to believe!
You’re even filling in Pokémon’s Evolutions now!\nSuperb!
Excellent! Perhaps if you trade with friends,\nyou’ll collect even more!
Outstanding! By the time this Pokédex is\ncompleted, you’ll be a true pro!
I have nothing left to say!\nYou’re the Pokémon Professor now!
You’ve completed a perfect Pokédex!\nCongratulations!

You’ve done it...\nYou’ve really, truly done it now!\c\nYou’ve completed a perfectly complete Pokédex!\nIt’s magnificent! Truly, this is a fantastic feat!

Hey, you!\c\nDo you want me to teach a marvelous move\nto [VAR PKNAME(0003)]?
Oh, it doesn’t seem to be necessary for your\n[VAR PKNAME(0003)] to learn a move for now.
[VAR PKNICK(0000)] wants to learn\nthe move [VAR MOVE(0001)].\c\nShould an old move be forgotten and\nreplaced with [VAR MOVE(0001)]?

You look like someone who wants to try your\nown strength!
Do you want to have a Pokémon battle with me,\na Coach Trainer?
Battle
Not now
[~ 4]
[~ 5]
OK! Here I come!
You won’t battle?\nOK, maybe next time!
You defeated a Coach Trainer, just like that!\nIn honor of your strength, I have a gift for you.
Revives will heal a Pokémon that’s been\nknocked out—something that a Potion can’t do!\c\nBe sure to use them wisely!
Hello there! I’m a Coach Trainer, at your service!
Do you want to train a bit before taking on\nMt. Moon?
[~ 12]
Are you ready?
I guess you didn’t need to battle.\nOK. Next time!
That was a great battle!\nTake this, as thanks.
TM57 is for the move Pay Day.\c\nIt’s a move that’ll scatter money around that\nyou can pick up later for a little extra\r\npocket money!
This area is popular for dates.\c\nI’m a proudly independent Coach Trainer\nat a date spot!
I’ll let you know, I’m pretty strong.\nWant me to battle you?
[~ 19]
I’ll give you a real workout!
Let me know if you change your mind.
Whew, I haven’t had fun like that in a long time!\nHere, take this!
TM15 is for Seismic Toss.\c\nIt deals damage equal to the level of the\nPokémon that uses the move.
Don’t you like Route 11? The double ones in its\nname are so cool!\c\nAnd guess what!\nI’m the Coach Trainer on Route “Double One”!
I am a Coach Trainer!\nThink you can take me on?
[~ 26]
I won’t hold back!\nYaaaah!
You won’t battle?\nOK. Next time.
You’re strong!\nYou’ve got me in a good mood, so take these.
If you use [VAR iCOLOR2(0002)][VAR PKNAME(0002)] Candy,\n[VAR PKNAME(0002)] will get much stronger.\c\nIf you want to get Candy for a specific Pokémon,\ntry catching that species over and over or send\r\nthem to the professor!
The Rock Tunnel is a tough place.\nWhy don’t you train here before you go?
I’ll train you every step of the way, if you want.
[~ 33]
OK, kiddo!\nI’ll give you a workout!
Too bad!\nI’ll be waiting for you!
Turns out, you taught me a thing or two!\nHere, take this. For the lesson.
TM13 can teach your Pokémon Brick Break.\c\nThis move can break through an opponent’s\nLight Screen or Reflect.
I w-w-want to get to the bottom of this...\c\nHow did a c-c-coward like me end up in charge\nof the Pokémon Tower...?
Oh, a b-b-battle? Well, I’m kinda strong...
[~ 40]
Here g-g-goes nothing!
Are you quitting...?\nAre you l-l-leaving...?
That battle took my mind off things a little bit.\nHere, I found these lying around.
The Candies that make Pokémon stronger...\c\nI have a bunch, too! I keep them safe in my\nCandy Jar...
A small path between towns...\nTee-hee. Route 7 is nice, right?
OK.\nAre you ready?
[~ 47]
Now let’s play...an ensemble\ncalled a battle!
Tee-hee. I get it.\nNow is not the time.
Thank you for the best battle.\nHere, take a token of my gratitude.
TM12 has the move Facade.\c\nIt’s a spunky move that deals double damage\nif the Pokémon using it has a status condition.
Hey! I’m a Coach Trainer!\nI’m on loan to the Fighting Dojo!
I’m a pretty strong Trainer!\nWant to have a battle?
[~ 54]
Let’s have a serious battle!\nHiyah!
Acknowledging the difference in power is\nalso a strength!
That was a great match!\nI want you to have this!
TM23 contains Thunder Punch!\c\nSmash your opponents with a fist wreathed\nin electricity!
Training on a romantic bridge, where you can\nsmell the sea breeze, doubles the effects of\r\nthe training.
Let’s do some coaching!\nAre you ready?
[~ 61]
Let a Pokémon battle begin, yo!
Not interested?\nOh, what a shame...
Such a romantic battle!\n...Here, a token of my gratitude.
TM59 holds the move Dream Eater.\c\nIt only works on Pokémon that are asleep, but...\nI assure you, its effect is devastating.
Pokémon Road is soothing, isn’t it?
...Huh?\nOh, sorry. I spaced out.\c\nI’m a Coach Trainer. Did you want to have\na battle?
[~ 68]
OK! I’m ready.
You won’t battle...\nThat’s OK. Take it easy.
It was fun.\nI think you’ll be able to put this to good use.
TM58 is for Drill Run.\c\nIt’s this drilly move that has a higher chance\nof scoring a critical hit.
The Trainers around here are all very strong!\c\nThat’s right.\nI’ve trained every single one of them.
I assume you want to get strong.\nShall I be your battle opponent?
[~ 75]
Here I come!
I see... That’s too bad.
I see the flame of potential in you!\nLet me give you a TM worthy of your skill.
You can use TM31 to teach your Pokémon the\nmove Fire Punch.\c\nIt can even give an opponent a burn if\nyou’re lucky!
Hey, you!\nAre you going to Cinnabar Island, by\r\nany chance?
I’m bored.\nIs it OK if I coach you a bit?
[~ 82]
My Pokémon will be super serious!
Seriously?\nMy sorrow is deep...
You’re pretty good!\nI’m gonna give you a little present!
TM35 has that move Ice Punch!\c\nIt’s, like, super effective against Dragon-type\nand Grass-type Pokémon.
Are you surprised to find a Coach Trainer at\na place like this?\c\nBut what is more surprising is that I come here\nevery single day...
There is nothing else to do but battle here.\nDo you want to battle?
[~ 89]
Of course you’ll battle me.\nOK! Here I come.
What’s the point of me being here?
Well, you came all the way here...\nLet me give you something really special.
Don’t you feel happy when you have a whole\nbunch of different Candies in your Candy Jar?
The abandoned Power Plant is the second least\ndesired place for Coach Trainers to be\r\nassigned to.
No matter where I am, I’m gonna do my job!
[~ 96]
I love my job!\nHere I come!
Oh?\nYou need time to prepare?
If I did a great job for you, I’m more than happy.\nHere’s a little something extra, too.
You’ve got to admit, Rare Candies really get\nthe job done!
Oh dear. I thought you were a Burglar, but\nyou’re a kid Trainer!
Well? Do you want to have some fun with\na Coach Trainer?
[~ 103]
OK. Let’s have a Pokémon battle!
Not interested?
Battling with you is so much fun!\nHere’s a present, just for you.
TM22 contains the move Rock Slide!\c\nIt’s really impressive, you know? It’s such a\ndownpour of rocks!\c\nIf you’re in a Double Battle, you can hit two\nopponents at once!
I seek a battle...
You...\nDo you seek a battle?
[~ 110]
En garde!
I see...
That was delightful.\nAllow me to demonstrate my thanks.
I would relish a rematch, should we have\nthe opportunity.
Wow! Your Pokémon [VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,0302)]isare so cute!
I’m a Coach Trainer!\nCome on, battle me!
[~ 117]
I’m super excited!\nIt’ll be a spectacle!
What? That’s too bad.\c\nLet’s do it next time.\nPromise me!
Ahaha! That was fun!\nHere, this’ll come in handy!
TM39 can be used to teach your Pokémon\nthe move Outrage.\c\nYou know what they say about cheerful folks like\nme—you don’t want to get us angry!
Hey, Champion!\c\nYou’re allowed to enter this cave!\nFrom now on, I’ll face you as a Coach Trainer!
Are you ready?\nThen let’s battle!
[~ 124]
Are you ready, Champion?!
If you change your mind, battle me.
What a great battle!\nThat’s what I expected from a Champion!\c\nI didn’t stand a chance...\nPlease, accept this from me.
I hear the Pokémon in the Cerulean Cave are\nterrifyingly strong...\c\nOf course, I’m just a guard, so I don’t know\nfor sure.
I’m Morimoto.\c\nI’m helping out the Coach Trainers.\nI’ve got my own reasons.
Do you really want to battle me, the strongest\nCoach Trainer?
[~ 131]
Here I go!
I see. OK, next time.
You’re strong.\nI’ll give you this.
I hope you catch a bunch of Pokémon and\nlove each and every one of them!
Oh, you’re a new Trainer.
I’m a Coach Trainer.\c\nCoach Trainers are the ones who stand in\nvarious places to train Trainers. I’m one of them.
[~ 138]
[~ 139]
We Coach Trainers are strong, if I do say\nso myself!
If you want to try out your strength,\nyou should definitely battle us.

There are Poké Balls in a mysterious machine!
It’s a scale!\nIs this used for weighing Pokémon?
Let’s see what the microscope has to show...\nYou can see a strange pattern on the dish!
“To catch a Pokémon, just throw a Poké Ball!\nYou don’t have to battle to weaken it.”
“If you don’t have any Poké Balls, you can’t do\nanything when you encounter wild Pokémon.\c\n“Buy a lot of Poké Balls at a Poké Mart!”
There is a book titled The Best of Pokémon\nPoems, by Professor Oak.

Whew! I’m trying to memorize all my notes.
OK, everyone!\c\nWhere can you find information that is useful\nfor Trainers?\c\nThat’s right! In this classroom, you can find it\non the blackboard or in books!\c\nPlease read bulletin boards for Trainer Tips\nin towns and cities, too!
If you walk around with your Pokémon or let\nthem battle, they’ll grow to love you even more!
We’re studying about the Pokémon types.
Let’s see, Pikachu is Electric type...\c\nThat means it has an advantage against Water-\nand Flying-type Pokémon!
Eevee is a Normal type.\c\nIt doesn’t have too many weaknesses, but it is\nweak against Fighting-type moves!
Let’s check out the notebook.\c\nThe first page says...\c\n“Poké Balls are used to catch and\ncarry Pokémon.\c\n“People who raise and battle with\nPokémon are called Trainers.”
The second page says...\c\n“To try to catch a Pokémon, throw a Poké Ball at\nthe center of the white ring!\c\n“If you throw a Poké Ball while a Pokémon is\nmoving, you may not be able to catch it.”
The third page says...\c\n“Pokémon Trainers seek others to battle and\ndefeat in Pokémon battles.\c\n“To Trainers, the taste of victory\nis sweet indeed.\c\n“Battles are constantly waged at Pokémon\nGyms everywhere.”
The fourth page says...\c\n“The goal for all Pokémon Trainers is simple. It is\nto defeat the eight Gym Leaders in the region.\c\n“Do so to earn the right to face...the extremely\nstrong Elite Four of the Pokémon League!”
Do you want to turn the page?
GIRL: Hey!\nDon’t look at my notes!
The blackboard lists status conditions that can\nhappen to Pokémon during battles.
Which topic do you want to read?
Falling asleep
Getting burned
Being poisoned
Being frozen
Paralysis
Never mind
“If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be unable to\nattack till it wakes.\c\n“It will stay asleep after battle.\c\n“Use an Awakening to wake it up.”
“When a Pokémon is burned, its Attack is\nlowered and it will steadily lose HP.\c\n“This lingers even after battle.\nUse a Burn Heal to cure it.”
“If a Pokémon is poisoned, it’ll steadily lose HP.\c\n“Poisoning won’t disappear after the battle,\nso heal it with an Antidote.”
“If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes\nhelplessly immobile.\c\n“It stays frozen even after the battle ends.\nUse an Ice Heal to thaw it out.”
“Paralysis reduces Speed and may prevent a\nPokémon from using moves in battle.\c\n“And paralysis doesn’t go away after the battle\nends, either. Use a Paralyze Heal to treat it.”
There are some notes in the notebook!\c\n“The Pokémon with the higher [VAR COLOR(0006)]Speed[VAR COLOR(0000)] stat gets\nto move first!”
There are some notes in the notebook!\c\n“[VAR COLOR(0006)]Attack[VAR COLOR(0000)] affects physical moves. [VAR COLOR(0006)]Sp. Atk[VAR COLOR(0000)] affects\nspecial moves. The higher the stat, the more\r\ndamage the move does!”
“In addition to HP, Pokémon have PP, which they\nuse to perform moves.\c\n“Recover PP by resting your tired Pokémon at\na Pokémon Center.”

Do you have lots of friends?\c\nPeople say Pokémon you get by trading with a\nfriend grow faster.\c\nI think it would be worth your time to give\ntrading a try.
Pokémon can keep on learning new moves, even\nif you stop them from evolving.\c\nIt’s a trick that experienced Trainers know!\c\nWait till your Pokémon learns a move it wouldn’t\notherwise, and only then do you evolve it!

Silph Co. is widely known to all.\c\nIt’s a victim of its own fame. It attracted\nTeam Rocket.

Team Rocket took off!\nWe can go out safely again!\r\nThat’s great!
There’s a book called Pokémon Journal:\nInterviews.
Will you read it?

Oh, wow! You’re [VAR TRNAME(0000)], right...?\nThe Champion?\c\nD-d-do you think maybe you could give me\nyour autograph?!
Lorelei of the Elite Four is just so cool!\nShe could freeze me solid with her icy gaze!
Whoa, hey there, Champion!\c\nYou’ve gotta be something if you were able\nto defeat Lorelei!
I really admire Bruno of the Elite Four.\nHe’s a Fighting-type expert and super buff, too!
Congrats on becoming Champion!\c\nYou gotta tell me, though... What was it like\nseeing Bruno’s muscles up close and in person?!
Nobody knows who the Gym Leader of\nthe Viridian City Gym is!\c\nIt’s like a mystery! I’m so curious!
