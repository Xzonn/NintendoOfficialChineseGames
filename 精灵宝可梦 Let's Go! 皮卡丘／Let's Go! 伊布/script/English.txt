msg_sub012_middlem_04	It proves a person defeated the Pewter City\nGym Leader.\c\nThe creator of the Badge clearly put some effort\ninto it.\c\nIt’s rough and hard, just like Rock-type Pokémon!
msg_sub012_middlem_05	It proves a person defeated the Cerulean City\nGym Leader.\c\nIf you look at it, you’ll see its elegant shape! It\nwas made to look just like a water drop.\c\nWatch out for the pointy end, though—it’s a\nbit sharp.
msg_sub012_middlem_06	It proves a person defeated the Vermilion City\nGym Leader.\c\nYou may have never heard the word before, but\nvermilion is actually the name of a color.\c\nIt’s a reddish orange, although for some reason\nthe Badge itself doesn’t have this color...
msg_sub012_middlem_07	It proves a person defeated the Celadon City\nGym Leader.\c\nThis is the most colorful of all the Badges here\nin the Kanto region, and it’s also the most\r\nexpensive to make.\c\nIf you put it on the ground and spin it like a top,\nit’s very pretty!
msg_sub012_middlem_08	It proves a person defeated the Fuchsia City\nGym Leader.\c\nIt has been ranked as the best Badge to give\nas an engagement gift, two years straight.\c\nI’m guessing that’s because it’s shaped like a\nheart and is such a pretty pink color.
msg_sub012_middlem_09	It proves a person defeated the Saffron City\nGym Leader.\c\nYou know, Trainers still debate whether it’s\nactually made out of real gold or not.
msg_sub012_middlem_10	It proves a person defeated the Cinnabar Island\nGym Leader.\c\nThis Badge is actually made from rock that was\nformed from lava from the volcano in Cinnabar.\c\nThe Gym Leader was very particular about that.

msg_sub058_bike_01	It’s a shiny bike.\nIt looks expensive!
msg_sub058_fat_03	Are you curious about that bike?
msg_sub058_fat_02	I like simple bikes, too.\nIt was a limited edition and popular a while ago.
msg_sub0658_fat_03	The refreshing color of the frame\nperfectly matches nature!
msg_sub058_fat_04	It costs 1,000,000! Bike enthusiasts\nare tormented by its super rarity!
msg_sub058_fat_05	Although its performance is average,\nit’s super easy to ride.
msg_sub058_fat_06	It’s even easy for beginners to ride!
msg_sub058_bike_04	OK...
msg_sub058_bike_02	It’s a shiny bike.\nIt looks very fast!
msg_sub058_fat_20	Are you curious about those Mach Bikes?
msg_sub058_fat_07	As its name suggests, a Mach Bike is super fast.
msg_sub058_fat_08	The frame in pursuit of lightness!\nUltimate reduced air resistance!
msg_sub058_fat_09	If you put weight on the carbon handlebars,\nit accelerates to top speed in a second!
msg_sub058_fat_10	With the momentum, you can climb any hills\nwith ease!
msg_sub058_fat_11	It’s a bit difficult to control, but even that\nis a lovable feature of the bike.

msg_sub058_fat_13	It allows you to perform actions such as\nwheelies and bunny hops.
msg_sub058_fat_14	You can even ride it on raised walkways or\ntrackless paths!
msg_sub058_fat_15	You can do acrobatic stuff, so it’s called an\nAcro Bike. That is my own theory, though.
msg_sub058_fat_16	If you value techniques more than anything else,\nthat is the bike for you!
msg_sub058_fat_17	You’re the first person who listened to all of my\nnerdy talk.
msg_sub058_fat_18	You must be a nerd, too!\nAs a token of our new friendship, please\r\ntake this!

msg_sub074_coach_04_07	If you use [VAR 1302(0002)][VAR 0101(0002)] Candy,\n[VAR 0101(0002)] will get much stronger.\c\nIf you want to get Candy for a specific Pokémon,\ntry catching that species over and over or send\r\nthem to the professor!
msg_sub074_coach_05_01	The Rock Tunnel is a tough place.\nWhy don’t you train here before you go?
msg_sub074_coach_05_02	I’ll train you every step of the way, if you want.

msg_sub074_coach_06_01	I w-w-want to get to the bottom of this...\c\nHow did a c-c-coward like me end up in charge\nof the Pokémon Tower...?
msg_sub074_coach_06_02	Oh, a b-b-battle? Well, I’m kinda strong...
msg_sub074_coach_06_03	[~ 40]
msg_sub074_coach_06_04	Here g-g-goes nothing!
msg_sub074_coach_06_05	Are you quitting...?\nAre you l-l-leaving...?
msg_sub074_coach_06_06	That battle took my mind off things a little bit.\nHere, I found these lying around.
msg_sub074_coach_06_07	The Candies that make Pokémon stronger...\c\nI have a bunch, too! I keep them safe in my\nCandy Jar...
msg_sub074_coach_07_01	A small path between towns...\nTee-hee. Route 7 is nice, right?

msg_sub074_coach_08_02	I’m a pretty strong Trainer!\nWant to have a battle?
msg_sub074_coach_08_03	[~ 54]
msg_sub074_coach_08_04	Let’s have a serious battle!\nHiyah!
msg_sub074_coach_08_05	Acknowledging the difference in power is\nalso a strength!
msg_sub074_coach_08_06	That was a great match!\nI want you to have this!
msg_sub074_coach_08_07	TM23 contains Thunder Punch!\c\nSmash your opponents with a fist wreathed\nin electricity!
msg_sub074_coach_09_01	Training on a romantic bridge, where you can\nsmell the sea breeze, doubles the effects of\r\nthe training.

msg_sub074_coach_09_03	[~ 61]
msg_sub074_coach_09_04	Let a Pokémon battle begin, yo!

msg_sub074_coach_09_06	Such a romantic battle!\n...Here, a token of my gratitude.
msg_sub074_coach_09_07	TM59 holds the move Dream Eater.\c\nIt only works on Pokémon that are asleep, but...\nI assure you, its effect is devastating.
msg_sub074_coach_10_01	Pokémon Road is soothing, isn’t it?
msg_sub074_coach_10_02	...Huh?\nOh, sorry. I spaced out.\c\nI’m a Coach Trainer. Did you want to have\na battle?
msg_sub074_coach_10_03	[~ 68]
msg_sub074_coach_10_04	OK! I’m ready.
msg_sub074_coach_10_05	You won’t battle...\nThat’s OK. Take it easy.
msg_sub074_coach_10_06	It was fun.\nI think you’ll be able to put this to good use.
msg_sub074_coach_10_07	TM58 is for Drill Run.\c\nIt’s this drilly move that has a higher chance\nof scoring a critical hit.
msg_sub074_coach_11_01	The Trainers around here are all very strong!\c\nThat’s right.\nI’ve trained every single one of them.
msg_sub074_coach_11_02	I assume you want to get strong.\nShall I be your battle opponent?
msg_sub074_coach_11_03	[~ 75]
msg_sub074_coach_11_04	Here I come!
msg_sub074_coach_11_05	I see... That’s too bad.
msg_sub074_coach_11_06	I see the flame of potential in you!\nLet me give you a TM worthy of your skill.
msg_sub074_coach_11_07	You can use TM31 to teach your Pokémon the\nmove Fire Punch.\c\nIt can even give an opponent a burn if\nyou’re lucky!
msg_sub074_coach_12_01	Hey, you!\nAre you going to Cinnabar Island, by\r\nany chance?
msg_sub074_coach_12_02	I’m bored.\nIs it OK if I coach you a bit?
msg_sub074_coach_12_03	[~ 82]
msg_sub074_coach_12_04	My Pokémon will be super serious!
msg_sub074_coach_12_05	Seriously?\nMy sorrow is deep...
msg_sub074_coach_12_06	You’re pretty good!\nI’m gonna give you a little present!
msg_sub074_coach_12_07	TM35 has that move Ice Punch!\c\nIt’s, like, super effective against Dragon-type\nand Grass-type Pokémon.
msg_sub074_coach_13_01	Are you surprised to find a Coach Trainer at\na place like this?\c\nBut what is more surprising is that I come here\nevery single day...
msg_sub074_coach_13_02	There is nothing else to do but battle here.\nDo you want to battle?
msg_sub074_coach_13_03	[~ 89]
msg_sub074_coach_13_04	Of course you’ll battle me.\nOK! Here I come.
msg_sub074_coach_13_05	What’s the point of me being here?
msg_sub074_coach_13_06	Well, you came all the way here...\nLet me give you something really special.
msg_sub074_coach_13_07	Don’t you feel happy when you have a whole\nbunch of different Candies in your Candy Jar?
msg_sub074_coach_14_01	The abandoned Power Plant is the second least\ndesired place for Coach Trainers to be\r\nassigned to.
msg_sub074_coach_14_02	No matter where I am, I’m gonna do my job!
msg_sub074_coach_14_03	[~ 96]
msg_sub074_coach_14_04	I love my job!\nHere I come!

msg_sub074_coach_16_02	You...\nDo you seek a battle?
msg_sub074_coach_16_03	[~ 110]
