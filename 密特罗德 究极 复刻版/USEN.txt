[500EC6A0]_MorphBallDescription	The {color[89d6ffff]}Morph Ball{color[000000ff]} changes your Suit into a compact, mobile sphere.  \n\nPress {[0100|13cd]} to enter Morph Ball mode.\n\nPress {[0100|14cd]} again to leave Morph Ball mode.\n\n{color[89d6ffff]}Samus's Notes:{color[000000ff]}\nLike the Power Suit, the Morph Ball is modular. There are several modifications that can be added to improve performance.
[500EC6A0]_BoostBallDescription	The {color[89d6ffff]}Boost Ball{color[000000ff]} can be used to increase the Morph Ball's speed for short periods.\n\nPress and hold {[0100|31cd]} to charge, then release {[0100|31cd]} to trigger a quick boost of speed.\n \n{color[89d6ffff]}Samus's Notes:{color[000000ff]}\nWhen charging, hold {[0100|31cd]} longer for a longer (and faster) Boost Charge.\n\nU-shaped channels known as half-pipes are found throughout the environment. The Boost Ball can be used in these areas to reach higher places. \n\nBuild a charge during descent in the half-pipe, then trigger the Boost while ascending the other side. This gives the speed and momentum necessary to reach new heights.\n
[500EC6A0]_SpiderBallDescription	The {color[89d6ffff]}Spider Ball{color[000000ff]} allows you to move the Morph Ball along magnetic rails.\n\nPress and hold {[0100|0ccd]} to activate the Spider Ball ability.\n \n{color[89d6ffff]}Samus's Notes:{color[000000ff]}\nFollow the magnetic rails to explore new areas.\n\nThe Morph Ball Bomb can be used to trigger a Bomb Jump while attached to a rail.\n\n\n
[500EC6A0]_BombDescription	The {color[89d6ffff]}Morph Ball Bomb{color[000000ff]} is the default weapon for the Morph Ball.\n\nPress {[0100|30cd]} when in Morph Ball mode to drop a Morph Ball Bomb. \n\n{color[89d6ffff]}Samus's Notes:{color[000000ff]}\nThe Morph Ball Bomb can be used to break cracked walls and activate certain devices.\n\nIf the Morph Ball is near a Morph Ball Bomb when it explodes, it will be popped a short distance into the air. This is called a{color[89d6ffff]} Bomb Jump{color[000000ff]}. \n\nWhen a Morph Ball Bomb explodes, it must be close to the enemy to be effective.\n\nThe Morph Ball Bomb can break items made of{color[89d6ffff]} Sandstone{color[000000ff]} or{color[89d6ffff]} Talloric Alloy{color[000000ff]}.\n
[500EC6A0]_PowerBombDescription	The {color[89d6ffff]}Power Bomb{color[000000ff]} is the strongest Morph Ball weapon.\n\nPress {[0100|06cd]} when in Morph Ball mode to drop a Power Bomb.  \n\n{color[89d6ffff]}Samus's Notes:{color[000000ff]}\nPower Bombs do not have unlimited ammo. Use them wisely.\n\nThe Power Bomb can destroy many materials, including {color[89d6ffff]}Bendezium{color[000000ff]}.\n\nEach Power Bomb Expansion found will increase the number of Power Bombs it's possible to carry by 1.\n
[500EC6A0]_ChargeBeamDescription	The {color[89d6ffff]}Charge Beam{color[000000ff]} allows you to increase the damage and effectiveness of the Arm Cannon.\n\nPress and hold {[0100|30cd]} to charge the Arm Cannon, then release {[0100|30cd]} to fire.\n\n{color[89d6ffff]}Samus's Notes:{color[000000ff]}\nThe Charge Beam has a limited 'tractor beam' capacity.  Use it to pull small objects in.\n\nThere are Charge Combo enhancements scattered through the environment.  They use the Charge Beam and the Missile Launcher in tandem to fire more effective blasts.\n\nThe Charge Beam increases the performance of each Arm Cannon mode.\n
[500EC6A0]_BeamComboDescription	The {color[89d6ffff]}Charge Combos{color[000000ff]} allow you to fire the Missile Launcher and Arm Cannon together. The combined attacks are stronger than normal blasts.\n\nThe Arm Cannon must be charged to use a Charge Combo.\n\nWhen your Arm Cannon is charged, press {[0100|06cd]} to fire the Charge Combo.\n\n{color[89d6ffff]}Samus's Notes:{color[000000ff]}\nThe {color[89d6ffff]}Single Shot{color[000000ff]} Charge Combos fire one blast at a time. Each shot uses a number of Missiles.\n\n{color[89d6ffff]}Sustained Fire{color[000000ff]} Charge Combos will fire as long as the Missile supply lasts. Hold {[0100|30cd]} down after firing. It takes 10 Missiles to trigger these Charge Combos, then 5 Missiles per second afterward.\n\nPage down for information on the individual Charge Combos. \n\nThis data will download to the Log Book after each Charge Combo is acquired. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

[481ED8EC]_000	Chozo script translated.
[481ED8EC]_001	Beginnings
[481ED8EC]_002	The history of the Chozo stretches back into ancient times, so far into the fog of the past that we know not where our ancestors came from. One thing is clear, however: the Chozo who colonized Tallon IV made a conscious choice to eschew a civilization of advanced technology. We Chozo chose to live in harmony with nature, guided by the providence of the universe. We believe we will spend peaceful days here and plan to leave our words from time to time. 
[CE8AAA42]_000	Chozo script translated.
[CE8AAA42]_001	Harmoni- zation
[CE8AAA42]_002	Many long years have passed since we Chozo first took root in this land. The passage of time has always been a source of fascination to us; it is the belief of many Chozo sages that the truths of the universe hide within the tumbling currents of time's flow. Even as we search for answers there, however, we find illumination in other, unexpected places. We know not how the ability has come to us, but recently many Chozo have begun to sense things beyond the realm of ordinary perception. Strange sights and inexplicable sensations flood our minds, filling us with visions. We take this growing ability to be a sign of our burgeoning harmonization with the infinite; perhaps, finally, the universe's secrets are becoming known to us.\n
[05D679E7]_000	Chozo script translated.
[05D679E7]_001	Meteor Strike
[05D679E7]_002	Disaster struck suddenly. We had a vague, dark foreboding, and it became truth. A meteor appeared from nowhere, casting a dark shadow of debris over the land with the violence of its impact. Its destructive force spent, the fallen star burned itself out rapidly, and the incident should have faded into memory...but the meteor brought with it corruption. A Great Poison burst forth into the land, a strange energy that clawed at natural life with a ferocity. That strange, negative energy emitted from the meteor expanded to encompass Tallon IV in a night, as a spider weaves a web.
[18D3495F]_000	Chozo script translated.
[18D3495F]_001	Spreading Evil
[18D3495F]_002	The cries of this dying land echo in our ears as we Chozo watch the Great Poison seep ever further into the living pulse of the planet. The dark energy sinks into the trees and waters, devouring all life. Peaceful beasts die by the thousands - some creatures survive, but their forms grow as twisted and evil as the force that fell from the sky. Many of these mutated monstrosities remain small enough to do little harm, but others grow enormous and threaten our very existence. One such beast defiles our sacred fountain, disgorging poison from its foul form, replacing pure, flowing water with cascades of creeping death. Even in the face of such horror, we Chozo do not turn in fear. We are all that stands in the way of this Great Poison, and it is our duty to contain it.
[D38F9AFA]_000	Chozo script translated.
[D38F9AFA]_001	Great Poison
[D38F9AFA]_002	What is this otherworldly pestilence that infests the land, seeking out life in its blind need for corruption? And where did the meteor that brought it originate? Was it crafted by alien hands, or is it a roving chunk of a planet that suffered a violent end? Our minds quail in horror at the thought that long ago, in some corner of the universe as yet unseen by our eyes, an entire planet was perhaps once coated with this Great Poison. Whatever cataclysm may have ruptured that doomed place must have been mighty, indeed...and if other meteors from it spread through space, bearing this evil to the far corners of the universe... We hold fast to the hope that this is not so, that the only surviving remnants of this evil are here, on Tallon IV. Then, at least, there is hope for its eradication.
[551BE854]_000	Chozo script translated.
[551BE854]_001	Shining One
[551BE854]_002	The power of our temple and the twelve Artifacts has sealed an evil in the depths of this planet. However, the future is cloudy to us, a world of veils where dark apparitions flit in the shadows. Within this strange world, one image stands out in the mist, flickering through the landscape, wraithlike. It is a human, a lone figure shining in the toxic shadows. We Chozo do not know what it is, but our hearts swell with hope at the promise of that glowing light. We will place our faith in our shrine; we will be there when the light shines upon our land. 
[9E473BF1]_000	Chozo script translated.
[9E473BF1]_001	Cipher
[9E473BF1]_002	As the Great Poison reaches ever further into the planet, we Chozo begin to feel the gnawings of despair--before it is too late, we now make our last stand. We have begun to build a temple to contain this darkness; at its heart we will place a Cipher, a mystical lock powered by twelve Artifacts and filled with as much power as we Chozo can harness. We wonder, though--even when we are done, will it be too late? And will the power of the temple, and the Cipher itself, prove strong enough to hold back the poisonous tide that even now swells within the ground, threatening all life? 
[6F118924]_000	Chozo script translated.
[6F118924]_001	Entrusted One
[6F118924]_002	So many creatures suffer beneath the blight upon the land, and we Chozo are no exception. But for all of our pain, we can at least believe in the promise of the future. We have come to believe that a time may never come when we can once again open the door and banish the darkness we've contained. Even so, our vigilance will forever remain. We believe that on some far-off day, a savior will come and continue what we have begun. For that savior, we will leave our ancient weapons and armor--the soul who can gather them will be the Entrusted One, the only being who can reverse the evil that grows here.
[A44D5A81]_000	Chozo script translated.
[A44D5A81]_001	Infestation
[A44D5A81]_002	To the Entrusted One: if you read these words, then our hope has not been in vain. Your path is fraught with danger--monstrosities beyond description lurk in the shadows, starving, hunting for prey, searching for ways to quench the poisonous urges that bloom in their brains. Some of these are shrewd, but they are blinded by their evil designs: believing in the black promise of the Great Poison, they seek to harness it for their own ends. It is these last that are the greatest danger. When you rid the universe of these creatures, you will be the true Entrusted One.
[253500FD]_000	Chozo script translated.
[253500FD]_001	Cradle
[253500FD]_002	None know if our temple, the Cradle, will prove powerful enough to contain this evil forever. For now, it wraps around that abomination, cutting it off from the world above. However we believe the power of Cipher, which has been produced by linking the twelve Artifacts, should be strong enough. The fate of this world is now left to the One who will collect all the Artifacts in the future. The time when the Entrusted One knows is approaching. 
[EE69D358]_000	Chozo script translated.
[EE69D358]_001	Worm
[EE69D358]_002	Many Chozo are gifted with the distant sight, and even more begin to learn it as our harmonization with the universe becomes more and more complete. We peer forward, seeing prophecy in the ripples of the water, hearing rumors of coming days on the breath of the wind. Though we celebrate the distant sight, many of these visions are dark--the worst of the prophecies, and the most common, tells of the coming of the Worm. Born from parasites, nurtured in a poisoned womb, the Worm grows, devouring from within, until the world begins to rot. Not all prophecies come to pass, of course, but we cannot help but fear this dark portent.
[68FDA1F6]_000	Chozo script translated.
[68FDA1F6]_001	Shapeless
[68FDA1F6]_002	Things bound to earthly shapes are temporal and frail; existing in a single dimension, they are fragile, vulnerable, and ultimately mortal. However, not all things obey this law--shapeless, they wait beyond the realm of perception, emerging only when one arrives who can feel their presence. Such is the will of the Chozo. Our will to defeat the evil seeping into this planet remains; we desire only to see the darkness meet its end. The will of the Chozo has no mind or reasoning of its own, though. This will be the Entrusted One's Trial. 
[A3A17253]_000	Chozo script translated.
[A3A17253]_001	Contain
[A3A17253]_002	The containment of the Great Poison... This task has fallen to the Chozo, and we will not flee from our duty, even as we suffer with the land and its creatures. We will pour our will into the Twelve--the Artifacts which form the lock that holds this great evil at bay in the depths of the planet. This lock must stand up to all who might come to assault it. To preserve the power of the seal, and to protect it from those who would meddle for their own designs, we will spread the Artifacts across the land, hiding them from prying eyes. The lock must never open until the day comes when this disaster can finally be put right.
[BEA442EB]_000	Chozo script translated.
[BEA442EB]_001	Fountain
[BEA442EB]_002	The future is a vague thing, ever-changing and always in doubt. Even if we Chozo could gain the ability to foresee the future, it would be a hollow gift, for we could never hope to control what has yet to occur. The fountain is an example of this--the day may come when its water dries up, and there is nothing we could do to stop such a tragedy. But we do know this: unlike the uncertain flow of water, the power of our will is strong and enduring. The will of the Chozo will never run dry.
[75F8914E]_000	Chozo script translated.
[75F8914E]_001	Prophecy of Light
[75F8914E]_002	Throughout our living nightmare, as we battle with this unyielding darkness, we Chozo see a light. This light glows with promise, chasing the shadows cast by the Great Poison and purifying that which has grown toxic. It is strange, though--at times it looks to our eyes as if the light coalesces into the figure of a woman. Burning brightly, the luminescence descends from space then retreats back into the infinite blackness from whence it came. When this prophecy comes to pass, when the light recedes, the Chozo's long vigilance of containment will finally come to an end.
[F36CE3E0]_000	Chozo script translated.
[F36CE3E0]_001	Artifacts
[F36CE3E0]_002	The 12 artifacts were forged by the Master Artisan then placed in sacred places across this land. These are no mere remembrances - every artifact is infused with the essence of an element we Chozo find precious. Taken alone, each of them exudes no little strength...but it is when they are joined that their true power shall be released. When that time comes, when the artifacts are brought together, they will lead the Entrusted One to the land of the Great Poison.
[38303045]_000	Chozo script translated.
[38303045]_001	Purification
[38303045]_002	The surges of negative energy brought by the meteor far exceed our expectation. We Chozo have yet to find a way to rid ourselves of the Great Poison. All we can do now is seal it away and wait for the day when a power to purify the poison appears. However, it is already impossible to collect all the pieces of the Great Poison, as it has already spread, seeping into the planet and hardening.

[FD6BF58E]_001	Spreading Evil
[FD6BF58E]_002	The cries of this dying land pulled us from our dreaming state, and now we Chozo walk as ghosts while the Great Poison sinks into the trees and waters, devouring all life. Some creatures survive, but their forms grow as twisted and evil as the force that fell from the sky. The heart of the planet will succumb soon, and so will we, even in our ghostly states. Already many Chozo have faded and passed into the unknown. The Great Poison is unlike anything we have glimpsed in this or any dimension. It eats relentlessly, worming out life wherever it blooms and corrupting what it cannot kill. It will be our undoing. Our last hope lies in the Cradle, the temple we hope might contain this abomination. It is almost complete, hovering over the impact site, the dark heart of the spreading evil. If we can finish before the last of our kind drifts into madness or death, there is a chance for this world. If we fail, we are doomed with it.

[A638777F]_002	Tangle Weeds are only dangerous to small organisms. They are covered in tiny barbs designed to trap potential meals. Tangle Weeds lack the strength to do anything more than hinder larger life-forms.
[EBC8C380]_000	Morphology: Venom Weed\nPoisonous plant that retracts into the ground if threatened.
[EBC8C380]_001	Venom Weed
[EBC8C380]_002	Venom Weeds evolved to thrive in the habitats of large organisms. They lure prey with brightly colored leaves, then detain it with tiny barbs that deliver a powerful toxin. Venom Weeds rapidly decompose anything that succumbs in their midst.
[C1C44285]_000	Morphology: Reaper Vine\nPowerful rock-dwelling tentacle.
[C1C44285]_001	Reaper Vine
[C1C44285]_002	A single eye upon the Reaper Vine keeps a constant vigil, but its vision is limited to 10 meters. A scythe-like appendage on its tip is honed to lethal sharpness. The Reaper Vine will swing this blade wildly at anything that enters its zone of perception.
[B8AAD4A2]_000	Morphology: Blastcap\nVolatile chemicals within this weed's toxic fungal cap may explode if agitated.
[B8AAD4A2]_001	Blastcap
[B8AAD4A2]_002	The poisonous flesh of the Blastcap helps keep it from being eaten. It also detonates its fungal cap when it senses even slight contact. 
[CD631A08]_000	Morphology: Scarab\nExploding parasites that can embed their bodies in solid rock.
[CD631A08]_001	Scarab
[CD631A08]_002	Scarabs think nothing of sacrificing themselves for the safety of their swarm. When a hostile life-form is sighted, they block its progress by embedding themselves in floors and walls. Embedded Scarabs violently self-destruct when threatened.
[B90BD230]_000	Aberration: Chozo Ghost\nSpectral entity. Bioelectric field invulnerable to natural energies. 
[B90BD230]_001	Chozo Ghost
[B90BD230]_002	As these entities phase in and out of existence, the only way to track them accurately is with x-ray scanning. This partially phased nature makes them invulnerable to natural energy types, such as fire, ice, and electricity. Their aggressive and erratic behavior is most likely due to the corrupting effects of Phazon in the Tallon IV environment. They appear to be drawn to Chozo religious sites, where they wreak havoc upon anything that dares enter the area.
[DAD56105]_000	Morphology: Stone Toad\nPreys on creatures smaller than itself. Vulnerable only from within.
[DAD56105]_001	Stone Toad
[DAD56105]_002	A Stone Toad is able to remain still for days. It preys upon creatures smaller than itself, inhaling them whole. Anything it finds undigestible, it regurgitates. Stone Toads use their tusks as a last resort in combat.
[CBD87ED5]_000	Morphology: Shriekbat\nTerritorial ceiling-dweller. Body temperature peaks at 121° centigrade.
[CBD87ED5]_001	Shriekbat
[CBD87ED5]_002	Shriekbats have high internal temperature, making them easy to spot with thermal imaging. They roost on cave ceilings while hunting for small prey. Fiercely territorial, they dive-bomb anything that wanders near.
[8BABAEF6]_000	Morphology: Eyon\nOrganism capable of channelling energy through its ocular tissue.
[8BABAEF6]_001	Eyon
[8BABAEF6]_002	Capable of launching sustained energy beams when active, the Eyon is sensitive to light and will close shut if a bright flash ignites nearby.
[044A30D3]_000	Morphology: Eyon\nImmobile organisms entirely composed of ocular tissue. 
[044A30D3]_001	Eyon
[044A30D3]_002	Capable of launching sustained energy beams when active, the Eyon is sensitive to light and will close shut if a bright flash ignites nearby.
[23503982]_000	Morphology: Geemer\nWall-crawling mollusk with retractable spikes. 
[23503982]_001	Geemer
[23503982]_002	The Geemer is an evolutionary offshoot of the Zoomer family. When threatened, it extends lethal spikes and retracts its head deep into its armored carapace.
[266EB5D0]_000	Morphology: Bombu\nRaw electricity made corporeal. Periodically sloughs off explosive segments of its form.
[266EB5D0]_001	Bombu
[266EB5D0]_002	The Bombu lacks any intelligence beyond an instinctive attraction to other charged energy sources. Producing electricity in a never-ending cycle, it constantly drops excess charges away from its main form.
[71969378]_000	Structure: War Wasp Hive\nPrimary War Wasp dwelling. Only vulnerable to heavy weaponry.
[71969378]_001	War Wasp Hive
[71969378]_002	War Wasps build their homes over existing crevices, using whatever materials are close at hand. They carry building fragments back to the construction site with their forelegs and glue them into place with adhesives secreted from their abdomens.
[39EB5BAF]_000	Structure: Ruined War\nWasp Hive
[39EB5BAF]_001	Ruined War Wasp Hive
[39EB5BAF]_002	War Wasps are resourceful insects. The destruction of a hive will not deter the survivors from rebuilding a new home. Surviving War Wasps will defend new sites with their lives until the hive is complete.
[5865A504]_000	Morphology: Oculus\nWall-crawler that generates electric pulses.
[5865A504]_001	Oculus
[5865A504]_002	The Oculus exposes its single eye when active. The electrical field that covers it is enough to deter most predators. If the Oculus detects anything capable of presenting a real threat, it retracts into its impermeable shell.
[58388B4F]_000	Morphology: Plazmite\nSmall insect capable of storing and releasing thermal energy.
[58388B4F]_001	Plazmite
[58388B4F]_002	Plazmites are attracted to sources of heat, thriving on the energy present there. They emit light when hunting, and will expel small bursts of thermal energy when threatened.
[6C2B07EC]_000	Morphology: Plated Parasite\nHardy member of the Parasite family. Invulnerable to most weaponry.
[6C2B07EC]_001	Plated Parasite
[6C2B07EC]_002	A cousin to the Parasite, these creatures are known for their amazing resilience. Field studies suggest a weakness to Morph Ball-delivered weapon systems.
[B7B2F8FA]_000	Morphology: Parasite\nInterstellar vermin. They travel in swarms.
[B7B2F8FA]_001	Parasite
[B7B2F8FA]_002	Indigenous to Tallon IV, a single Parasite is harmless to larger life-forms. However, they tend to travel in large groups, swarming over potential prey. Such swarms can be dangerous.
[9AB68CF2]_000	Structure: Hive\nPrimary Barbed War Wasp dwelling.
[9AB68CF2]_001	Hive\n(Barbed Wasp)
[9AB68CF2]_002	An extremely durable wasp hive. Can only be destroyed by direct exposure to fire from below.
[27B2B760]_000	Structure: Hive\nPrimary Barbed War Wasp dwelling. This one is completely destroyed.
[27B2B760]_001	Hive\n(Destroyed)

[3CF3B704]_001	Parasite Larva
[3CF3B704]_002	Log 10.515.8\nOur initial tests exposing Tallon IV’s indigenous parasites to Phazon appear to be successful. Increases in strength, size and aggressiveness are common in all test subjects, as well as unforeseen evolutions like additional poison sacs within the abdomen and the appearance of a second ring of mandibles in several subjects. These creatures were chosen because of their resilience, and it appears possible that, given enough exposure to Phazon, they may one day be able to survive on any planet we transport them to. Our methods will have to be refined; we currently have a 100% extinction rate after the fourth infusion period, and most survivors of the third infusion stage are so violent and uncontrollable that they have to be euthanized. Even still, we remain hopeful that further experimentation will result in success.

[91A941F1]_002	Log 10.299.2\nScans of the Spiral Sector detected a massive energy spike emanating from a Wanderer-class planet identified as Tallon IV. Scout reconnaissance was immediately dispatched to the center of the spike, a land mass at heading mark 40.08.02, returning with planetary samples and atmospheric imaging. Analysis shows the energy source to be an unstable radioactive material of enormous potential. We are unable to form an accurate risk-assessment at this time, but we are unlikely to find an energy source this powerful again. Analysis will continue, but currently Tallon IV appears to be a viable secondary headquarters.

[920677FB]_001	Metroid Studies
[920677FB]_002	Log 10.444.4\n\nInitial transfer of Metroids to Tallon IV research facilities has been completed. Three were terminated in an incident at the landing site, but the others were pacified and transported safely. Initial Phazon-infusion testing is under way. We are eager to observe the effects of Phazon on Metroids, especially their ability to absorb and process the energy given off by Phazon sources. Early research suggests a considerable growth in power and size. Whether the creatures stay stable thereafter remains to be seen.

[7CCFFF55]_000	Morphology: Thardus\nAn animated, sentient creature of stone charged with Phazon radiation. 
[7CCFFF55]_001	Thardus
[7CCFFF55]_002	The Phazon radiation given off by Thardus negates auto-targeting systems, preventing lock-on. It may be possible to acquire alternate targets with a different Visor. The chaotic nature of Phazon irradiation leads to instability in its structural integrity. Thardus can encase targets in ice, and its colossal size and strength make it a formidable opponent.

[8168BC47]_000	Morphology: Flickerbat\nScavenger with optical camouflaging that renders it invisible to the naked eye.
[8168BC47]_001	Flickerbat
[8168BC47]_002	Flickerbats are deceptive creatures. The only way to track them reliably is with x-ray imaging. They fly ceaselessly, hunting insects and other small prey that float on the air currents. Flickerbats tend to fly in cyclical hunting patterns, using primitive sonar to navigate. 
[A888903D]_000	Morphology: Ice Beetle\nBurrowing insect with an ice-reinforced carapace. Averse to heat.
[A888903D]_001	Ice Beetle
[A888903D]_002	This member of the Beetle family has adapted to life in the sub-zero temperatures in the Phendrana Drifts, growing a thick ice shell over its entire body. The ice is extremely resilient, providing the Ice Beetle with extra protection and augmented digging abilities. 
[DF4642BC]_000	Morphology: Sheegoth\nSupreme predator of the Phendrana Drifts.
[DF4642BC]_001	Sheegoth
[DF4642BC]_002	Sheegoths are invulnerable to most Beam weapons. The crystals on their back absorb energy, which they can fire at prey. Sheegoths have poor stamina. They hyperventilate after using their breath attack, making their mouth area vulnerable. The soft underbelly of a Sheegoth is susceptible to concussive blasts. In battle, they expel blasts of frigid gas to ensnare their targets. They are also fond of ramming and trampling their hapless prey.
[BC86A63D]_000	Morphology: Baby Sheegoth\nGlacial predator. Ice shell protects vulnerable dorsal area.
[BC86A63D]_001	Baby Sheegoth
[BC86A63D]_002	Young Sheegoths grow a resilient shell of ice on their backs which serves to protect a layer of vulnerable flesh. With this being their only weak point, Baby Sheegoths will turn quickly in order to not allow predators the opportunity to strike at their backs. Powerful hunters, they fire bursts of ultracold gas at potential prey, then feast on their frozen victim.
[0BAA2966]_000	Morphology: Space Pirate\nSentient aggressor species well trained in weapon and melee combat.
[0BAA2966]_001	Space Pirate
[0BAA2966]_002	Space Pirates wield Galvanic Accelerator Cannons and forearm-mounted Scythes in combat. This species seeks to become the dominant force in the galaxy, and their technology may help them realize this goal. Ruthless and amoral, the Pirates care little for the cost of their ambition. Only the results matter, and they take these very seriously.
[EE99BA29]_000	Morphology: Shadow Pirate\nPirate forces trained and equipped for stealth operations.
[EE99BA29]_001	Shadow Pirate
[EE99BA29]_002	A select group of Space Pirates have access to sophisticated cloaking technology. This gear drains high levels of power, however, forcing them to rely solely on melee weapons in battle. Use enhanced detection gear when fighting these units.
[1F2379A3]_000	Morphology: Flying Pirate\nPirates trained and equipped for airborne assault.
[1F2379A3]_001	Flying Pirate
[1F2379A3]_002	Flying Pirates are extremely agile in the air, but the heat signatures of their jet packs can be tracked with Thermal Imaging. While their Missiles are extremely potent, their jet packs can be even more so. If the pack fails, they will make a suicide strike. 
[973D0A9A]_000	Morphology: Ice Shriekbat\nIce-encased ceiling-dweller.
[973D0A9A]_001	Ice Shriekbat
[973D0A9A]_002	Like standard Shriekbats, these creatures are easily spotted with Thermal Imaging. They roost on cave ceilings, subsisting on insects, reptiles and small mammals. Fiercely territorial, they will dive-bomb anything that wanders near. 
[3505811E]_000	Morphology: Tallon Metroid\nEnergy-based parasitic predator.
[3505811E]_001	Tallon Metroid
[3505811E]_002	The effects of Phazon have turned these Metroids--a species of alpha predator native to SR388--into a unique subspecies found only on Tallon IV. A Tallon Metroid will latch onto its prey and drain energy, growing larger as it does. The only way to shake an attached Tallon Metroid is to enter Morph Ball mode and lay a Bomb.
[F8EF6A57]_000	Morphology: Hunter Metroid\nAdolescent Metroid. Energy-siphon tentacles increase its threat level.
[F8EF6A57]_001	Hunter Metroid
[F8EF6A57]_002	As Metroids develop, they become more efficient predators. Energy-draining tentacles allow them to attack at a distance. Quick to anger, a Hunter Metroid will charge troublesome prey and attempt to ram them into submission. Cold-based attacks are still quite effective against these creatures.
[DDF4AB57]_000	Morphology: Crystallite\nTerritorial cold-weather scavenger.
[DDF4AB57]_001	Crystallite
[DDF4AB57]_002	The shell of a Crystallite reflects Beam weapons, and can only be cracked by a concussive blast. They hang upside down in an ice cave during their larval stage. Moisture runs off its body and forms the hard ice shell, which the Crystallite retains for the rest of its life.
[9C82677F]_000	Morphology: Pulse Bombu\nLife-form of raw energy. Periodically releases explosive segments.
[9C82677F]_001	Pulse Bombu
[9C82677F]_002	Pulse Bombus are energy beings, invulnerable to most known weapons. Electrical energy can harm them, however. They lack any intelligence beyond an instinctive attraction to other charged energy sources. Pulse Bombus produce energy constantly. All excess energy is shed, regardless of who or what may be nearby.
[A9CD451A]_000	Morphology: Scatter Bombu\nPulsing tendrils of energy extend from creature's body. 
[A9CD451A]_001	Scatter Bombu
[A9CD451A]_002	Like all Bombus, these creatures can only be harmed by electrical energy. Proximity to these life-forms may result in electrical Visor interference. It is possible to avoid engaging Scatter Bombus by rolling into the Morph Ball and slipping between the rotating energy streams.
[93B5B2F8]_000	Morphology: Frozen Scarab\nGlacial parasite. Will explode to protect the swarm.
[93B5B2F8]_001	Frozen Scarab
[93B5B2F8]_002	Like their nonglacial cousins, Frozen Scarabs will sacrifice themselves for the swarm. When a hostile life-form is near, they embed themselves in floors and walls to block the creature's progress. Once embedded, they will self-destruct after a short time.
[984400D6]_000	Morphology: Jelzap\nAquatic predator made of electrically bound skeletal halves. 
[984400D6]_001	Jelzap
[984400D6]_002	The Jelzap's brain is located in the upper half of its body, while the heart and digestive tract occupy the lower half. Linked only by electrical impulses, the two halves somehow function effectively enough to launch the Jelzap to the top of Tallon IV's aquatic food chain.
[67AC4D41]_000	Morphology: Ice Parasite\nScavenger with a crystalline outer shell.
[67AC4D41]_001	Ice Parasite
[67AC4D41]_002	Parasites are hardy creatures, able to adapt to any environment within three generations. The Ice Parasite is a prime example. Having adjusted to a frigid climate, this vermin now thrives in it. Omnivorous, it can exist in areas hostile to most life-forms.
[3D8AB6C1]_000	Mechanoid: Sentry Drone\nWell-armed and armored security mecha. 
[3D8AB6C1]_001	Sentry Drone
[3D8AB6C1]_002	Sentry Drones have limited intelligence but do their assigned tasks well. Being machines, they are susceptible to electrical attacks. When alerted, Drones initiate a security lockdown and then attempt to neutralize the intruder. Their electronic warfare suite can scramble Visor technology as well.
[A9ED37AC]_000	Morphology: Glider\nDocile, airborne creatures with unusual magnetic properties.
[A9ED37AC]_001	Glider
[A9ED37AC]_002	Gliders live a relatively peaceful existence. They have a magnetic signature attuned to common Grapple Beam technology; the sport of 'glider riding' involves using a Grapple Beam to attach to a Glider, then staying on it as long as possible.
[3034822E]_000	Morphology: Ice Burrower\nBurrower adapted to subfreezing climates.
[3034822E]_001	Ice Burrower
[3034822E]_002	A hardy life-form, the Ice Burrower has adapted to the frigid clime of Phendrana. It spends most of its time tunneling through the frozen soil, but will occasionally surface to attack passersby.

[DD4DD38A]_000	Plasma Beam
[8F68D772]_000	Morphology: Grizby\nSubvolcanic carrion feeder. Carapace can be breached by Missiles.
[8F68D772]_001	Grizby
[8F68D772]_002	The Grizby's carapace has been fused together by superheated air. This barrier stands up to everything but concussive blasts. Its intelligence is limited to instinctive scavenging patterns.
[ED007111]_000	Morphology: Magmoor\nFire-breathing serpent that dwells in lava. 
[ED007111]_001	Magmoor
[ED007111]_002	Magmoors prefer extreme heat zones, and are susceptible to frigid attack forms. Sightless, they navigate the lava currents using their sonar receptors. Magmoors have a keen sense of smell, enabling them to pinpoint targets with startling accuracy.
[E3CD731D]_000	Morphology: Olbap\nInsectoid scavenger. Instinctually attacks anything smaller than itself. 
[E3CD731D]_001	Olbap
[E3CD731D]_002	Olbaps are protected by a stout carapace of overlapping scales. They can only be attacked when flipped over. Olbaps will ignore large predators as they scour igneous surfaces for sustenance. In battle, they will roll into a highly maneuverable ball, then bludgeon their opponent.
[B0DC1B98]_000	Morphology: Puddle Spore\nSentient floating lava mollusk protected by an impenetrable shell.
[B0DC1B98]_001	Puddle Spore
[B0DC1B98]_002	A Puddle Spore opens when approached, attempting to intimidate with its size. When opened, direct fire to its mantle causes it to flip into a defensive position. If it can slam shut, it ejects a spread of harmful energy globules.
[3081ABEA]_000	Morphology: Triclops\nHard-shelled creature with powerful jaws. 
[3081ABEA]_001	Triclops
[3081ABEA]_002	The Triclops is a hunter-gatherer. It collects small creatures and bits of foodstuff, then deposits them elsewhere for later consumption. The hard tripartite mandibles it uses to move earth and rock are quite strong and difficult to escape once ensnared.
[AEFB2390]_000	Morphology: Puffer\nUnstable gas-filled organism. Will rupture on contact.
[AEFB2390]_001	Puffer
[AEFB2390]_002	Puffers fill their bodies with lethal meta-viprium gas and float about in search of food. If ruptured, the gas within the Puffer is violently released. Despite their fragile bodies, Puffers are aggressive hunters. The gas cloud they release upon death is often fatal to the creature that brings them down as well.
[3771E537]_000	Morphology: Plated Puffer\nMutated Puffer with reinforced epidermis.
[3771E537]_001	Plated Puffer
[3771E537]_002	Phazon exposure has created a mutant strain of Puffers on Tallon IV. They have developed plated skin, making them harder to burst. Concussive weapons can still do the job, however. The gas within the Plated Puffer is just as deadly as that within their 'cousins.'

[62DC2DF8]_001	Elite Pirates
[62DC2DF8]_002	Log 11.001.9\n\nInitial Project Helix experiments with Space Pirate embryos were disastrous. The Phazon-infusion process degenerated brain tissue even as it augmented muscle mass. None of what we have termed 'Elite Pirates' lived to maturity; the few that survived their infanthood suffered severe psychotic breakdowns as juveniles, killing anything within their zone of perception. Research team Sclera made a recent breakthrough, in which parasite studies with a Phazon strain code-named 'Vertigo' were highly successful. Since then, we have fused Vertigo Phazon with Space Pirate DNA with great success. The latest batch of Elite Pirates have reached maturity successfully and are ready for field testing and training.

[A980FE5D]_002	Log 11.242.3\n\nPrevious problems with power supplies in the mining operation have been solved, and we are back on schedule. By shunting thermal energy from the lava flows in the Magmoor Caverns region of Tallon IV, we now have the means to run all of the earth-moving and Phazon-refinement machinery stationed in the caves surrounding the impact crater. Once the operation is running smoothly, we will be able to make projections on Phazon yields and predict if we will be able to leach enough of the substance from the earth to suit the requests of research labs Hydra and Aether. Additionally, three teams of deep-earth Harrowers have already begun sealing off several of the Phazon-rich caves for use as Metroid farms.

[F9459224]_001	Omega Pirate
[F9459224]_002	Log 11.232.8\nElite Pirate Upsilon's propensity for Phazon has enabled our research team to infuse it far beyond our safety restrictions, and the results have been extremely encouraging. Its constant Phazon diet has increased its mass exponentially, but it has retained all mental faculties and shows dexterity with all Elite weaponry, including Plasma Incendiary Launchers and the Chameleon Manta issued for cloaking purposes. Elite Pirate Upsilon exhibits miraculous healing abilities; when injured, it seeks out Phazon deposits and coats itself in the substance, which instantly mends the creature's wounds. The subject, which we are code-naming Omega Pirate based on these developments, shows potential to be a new standard for our armies. Our only concern at this point is its potential overdependence on Phazon.

[DFC50A64]_002	Log 11.369.4\n\nAs we continue to observe the development of Project Helix's Elite Pirates, it becomes increasingly obvious that these warriors will usher in a new era of Space Pirate dominance. They are incredibly resistant to damage, and their ability to transport and wield so many weapons at once makes them the ideal mainstays of our ground forces. Though they are not as quick as typical Pirates, it makes little difference. With a platoon of Elite Pirates in the vanguard of an army of normal and Flying Pirates, we will have a near-indestructible backbone that should turn the tide in any engagement.

[853949CE]_000	Morphology: Elite Pirate\nPhazon-enhanced Space Pirate. Incredibly strong, armored, and well armed.
[853949CE]_001	Elite Pirate
[853949CE]_002	Elite Pirates are potent foes. Their energy-siphon system absorbs Beam weapon shots. The nature of this system makes them vulnerable to concussion-based weapons. Well armed, the Elite Pirate is effective in close combat and at a distance. Their massive size can be a weakness, and their sluggish speed allows for evasion and quick attacks.

[E382F03E]_000	Morphology: Elite Pirate\nPhazon-enhanced Space Pirate. Incredibly strong, armored, and well armed.
[E382F03E]_001	Elite Pirate
[E382F03E]_002	Elite Pirates are potent foes. Their energy-siphon system absorbs Beam weapon shots. The nature of this system makes them vulnerable to concussion-based weapons. Well armed, the Elite Pirate is effective in close combat and at a distance. Their massive size can be a weakness, and their sluggish speed allows for evasion and quick attacks.
[F2F152F4]_000	Mechanism: Mega Turret\nPerimeter defense turret reinforced with energy shielding.
[F2F152F4]_001	Mega Turret
[F2F152F4]_002	Frustrated with inferior armor plating on standard defense turrets, the Space Pirates added energy shielding to a modified heavy Cannon. The new shielding and increased Beam strength makes the Mega Turret an efficient point defense weapon.
[CF683337]_000	Morphology: Burrower\nTunneling insect predator.
[CF683337]_001	Burrower
[CF683337]_002	Similar to the Beetle, though it spends more time underground. It seeks seismic disturbances, then surfaces to attack. It has enough cunning to realize when something is too large for it to handle; beyond that, it is fairly ignorant. What it lacks in brains, it makes up for with aggression.
[A26A9809]_000	Morphology: Phazon Burrower\nTunneling insect made extremely toxic by concentrated deep-sediment mineral absorption.
[A26A9809]_001	Phazon Burrower
[A26A9809]_002	Burrowers that dig through Phazon-infused soil have become quite toxic. They have developed an unpleasant mutation as a result. When a Phazon Burrower's carapace ruptures, clouds of deadly toxins are released.
[EEB20113]_000	Morphology: Void Bombu\nBombus capable of phazing out of the visible plane.
[EEB20113]_001	Void Bombu
[EEB20113]_002	The phased nature of the Void Bombu makes detection difficult. Most Visor tech is useless when tracking these creatures. They still shed electric charges, though they aren't drawn to charged energy sources as most Bombus are.
[B6FDD1CC]_000	Morphology: Power Trooper\nSpace Pirate armed with Power Beam technology.
[B6FDD1CC]_001	Power Trooper
[B6FDD1CC]_002	Space Pirates have reverse-engineered several of your weapons, including the Power Beam. A flaw in the design makes these Pirates vulnerable to their own Beam weapon system. These weapons are inferior to your Chozo-designed originals, but still quite potent.
[ABF8BD55]_000	Morphology: Ice Trooper\nSpace Pirate armed with Ice Beam technology.
[ABF8BD55]_001	Ice Trooper
[ABF8BD55]_002	Space Pirates have reverse-engineered several of your weapons, including the Ice Beam. A flaw in the design makes these Pirates vulnerable to their own Beam weapon system. These weapons are inferior to your Chozo-designed originals, but still quite potent.
[3ABB8192]_000	Morphology: Wave Trooper\nSpace Pirate armed with Wave Beam technology.
[3ABB8192]_001	Wave Trooper
[3ABB8192]_002	Space Pirates have reverse-engineered several of your weapons, including the Wave Beam. A flaw in the design makes these Pirates vulnerable to their own Beam weapon system. These weapons are inferior to your Chozo-designed originals, but still quite potent.
[D1AC6904]_000	Morphology: Plasma Trooper\nSpace Pirate armed with Plasma Beam technology.
[D1AC6904]_001	Plasma Trooper
[D1AC6904]_002	Space Pirates have reverse-engineered several of your weapons, including the Plasma Beam. A flaw in the design makes these Pirates vulnerable to their own Beam weapon system. These weapons are inferior to your Chozo-designed originals, but still quite potent.
[D23B52AE]_000	Morphology: Aqua Reaper\nPowerful aquatic tentacle, part of a submerged organism.
[D23B52AE]_001	Aqua Reaper
[D23B52AE]_002	Similar in nature to the surface-based Reaper Vine, the Aqua Reaper has adapted to a liquid environment. It shares the poor vision of its rock-dwelling 'cousin,' relying on a crude sonar sense to seek prey. Unhindered by water, the Aqua Reaper has considerable speed and strength.
[6A4DE1B9]_000	Morphology: Aqua Pirate\nSpace Pirates with exoskeletons modified for underwater use.
[6A4DE1B9]_001	Aqua Pirate
[6A4DE1B9]_002	Using modified thruster-packs and Gravity Suit technology, the Space Pirates have armorsuits for use in liquid environments. Thermal tracking is still very useful against these units, as the Pirate engineers have yet to eliminate the thruster-pack's high heat signature.
[E636ED7B]_000	Morphology: Phazon Elite\nElite Pirate infused with energized Phazon.
[E636ED7B]_001	Phazon\nElite
[E636ED7B]_002	The Phazon-charged Elite Pirates rely more on their Wave Quake Generators, opting not to carry the vulnerable Plasma Artillery Cannons normally used by Elites. The direct fusing of Phazon into their bodies provides a tremendous level of energy. The drastically lower life span that comes with this process is of little concern to the Pirate Research team.
[BF14D821]_000	Mechanoid: Beta Drone\nSecurity mecha equipped with phased cloaking grid. 
[BF14D821]_001	Beta Drone
[BF14D821]_002	The next generation of Drones operate fully cloaked from normal sight. A defense shield and extra Beam Cannon increases their combat effectiveness as well. Still, they are machines, and can be nullified with electromagnetic pulses.
[E0596433]_000	Morphology: Omega Pirate\nMost powerful of the Elite Pirate Forces.
[E0596433]_001	Omega Pirate
[E0596433]_002	Omega Pirate can become invisible to normal sight. It is vulnerable when cloaked, as all energy is drawn from defense systems. By exposing itself to Phazon, it can regenerate damaged tissue and organs. Considered the pinnacle of the Elite Pirate program, this enemy should be handled with extreme caution and maximum firepower.
[20452CF9]_000	Morphology: Lumigek\nPhazon-charged reptiles.
[20452CF9]_001	Lumigek
[20452CF9]_002	Natives of Tallon IV, the Lumigeks travel in swarms to increase their odds of survival. They absorb and radiate Phazon energy, making these swarms a threat. 
[F6842A26]_000	Morphology: Phazon Maggot\nPhazon-infused vermin.
[F6842A26]_001	Phazon Maggot
[F6842A26]_002	Exposure to Phazon has had a dramatic impact on the Tallon IV ecosystem. The flora and fauna that manage to survive Phazon exposure often mutate in the process. Even the lowly maggot is no exception.
[AD0ACEAB]_000	Morphology: Metroid Prime\nHighly evolved, Phazon-producing life-form.
[AD0ACEAB]_001	Metroid Prime
[AD0ACEAB]_002	The aberration known as Metroid Prime is the source of Phazon, making it immensely powerful. A genetic flaw makes it susceptible to certain weapons for brief periods. Only its head is truly vulnerable; other attacks are a nuisance. Offensively, Metroid Prime has a number of natural and mechanical weapons at its disposal. These include Ultrafrigid Breath, Multi-Missiles, Snare Beams, and Particle Wave Projectors. Its massive strength and barbed carapace make it lethal in melee combat. Recommend maximum firepower when engaging this enemy.
[D2504666]_000	Morphology: Metroid Prime\nThe core essence of Metroid Prime.
[D2504666]_001	Metroid Prime (Core)
[D2504666]_002	Scan indicates that the Phazon energy form of Metroid Prime is invulnerable to all conventional weapons; only attacks from a Phazon-fuzed Arm Cannon will damage it. It generates pools of Phazon when it attacks; use these to fuel your Suit's Phazon weapon system. The entity can also spawn Metroids to assist it in battle, rendering itself invisible when it does so. 
[7BCFFAE1]_000	Morphology: Meta Ridley\nGenetically enhanced Ridley metaform.
[7BCFFAE1]_001	Meta Ridley
[7BCFFAE1]_002	Reborn and evolved through Pirate technology, Meta Ridley is a fearsome enforcer. His armored hide is extremely resilient, save for the chest, which has thinner plating. The Pirates have fused a number of potent weapons to the creature, including a Multi-Missile System, a Kinetic Breath Weapon, a Meson Bomb Launcher, and an Ultrathermal Flamestrike Projector. Meta Ridley is also a formidable melee combatant, making any sort of engagement a risky proposition.
[DC935FCD]_000	Morphology: Fission Metroid\nMetroid with the ability to split into two forms.
[DC935FCD]_001	Fission Metroid
[DC935FCD]_002	The Fission Metroid is a mutant, capable of splitting in two. This split endows the new creatures with invulnerability to most weaponry. This effect is unstable, resulting in weakness to a type of weapon fire. The vulnerability appears to be random, due to the chaotic nature of Phazon mutation.
[A84E9954]_000	Morphology: Power Metroid\nMutated Fission Metroid. 
[A84E9954]_001	Power Metroid
[A84E9954]_002	Once split, Fission Metroids gain invulnerability to most weaponry. A genetic flaw leaves them susceptible to certain weapons; in the case of the Power Metroid, shots from the Power Beam will harm them.
[1E93642B]_000	Morphology: Ice Metroid\nMutated Fission Metroid.
[1E93642B]_001	Ice Metroid
[1E93642B]_002	Once split, Fission Metroids gain invulnerability to most weaponry. A genetic flaw leaves them susceptible to certain weapons; in the case of the Ice Metroid, shots from the Ice Beam will harm them.
[0496D5D8]_000	Morphology: Wave Metroid\nMutated Fission Metroid.
[0496D5D8]_001	Wave Metroid
[0496D5D8]_002	Once split, Fission Metroids gain invulnerability to most weaponry. A genetic flaw leaves them susceptible to certain weapons; in the case of the Wave Metroid, shots from the Wave Beam will harm them.
[30B56A20]_000	Morphology: Plasma Metroid\nMutated Fission Metroid.
[30B56A20]_001	Plasma Metroid
[30B56A20]_002	Once split, Fission Metroids gain invulnerability to most weaponry. A genetic flaw leaves them susceptible to certain weapons; in the case of the Plasma Metroid, shots from the Plasma Beam will harm them.

[B389B6D6]_002	Log 10.308.0\nField team reports are in on an aged structure of alien design built on the surface of Tallon IV. Studies show this structure projects a containment field. This field bars access to a prime source of energy within a deep crater. Science Team believes the field is powered by a number of strange Chozo Artifacts. We have found some of these relics and studies on them have begun. As this field could hinder future energy production operations on Tallon IV, we must dismantle it as soon as possible. If this means the destruction of the Chozo Artifacts, it will be done.

[9405B66C]_004	The Chozo Cipher, the congregation of Artifacts that held the Great Poison at bay, is broken now. Fearful of the potential within the small statues, the invaders known as Space Pirates tried to destroy them, only to fail in every attempt. Instead, they have scattered what they could not break across the planet, hiding the Artifacts far from one another, knowing that their reunion could spell disaster for their dark designs. They are right to fear them. Great power sleeps inside these tokens; we Chozo built our temple, the Cradle, to draw its strength from their communal energy. If they could be gathered together once again and replaced in the Cradle, then hope might bloom again in this suffocating land.

[F0D4998F]_002	Log 09.992.3\n\nZebes has fallen. All ground personnel are presumed dead, either killed by the Hunter clad in metal or in the subsequent destruction of the underground facilities. Our research frigates Orpheon, Siriacus, and Vol Paragom were in orbit at zero hour and managed to retreat. Frigate Orpheon is now docked at Vortex Outpost. Orpheon's cargo appears to have a 100% survival rate; Metroids are healthy but on restricted feeding schedules due to uncertain supply status. We are ready to begin research on the Metroids and other promising life-forms. Security status remains at Code Blue; no signs of pursuit from the Hunter.

[7640EB21]_002	Log 10.299.2\n\nScans of the Spiral Sector detected a massive energy spike emanating from a Wanderer-class planet identified as Tallon IV. Scout reconnaissance was immediately dispatched to the center of the spike, a land mass at heading mark 40.08.02, returning with planetary samples and atmospheric imaging. Analysis shows the energy source to be an unstable radioactive material of enormous potential. We are unable to form an accurate risk assessment at this time, but we are unlikely to find an energy source this powerful again. Analysis will continue, but currently Tallon IV appears to be a viable secondary headquarters.

[BD1C3884]_002	Log 10.308.0\n\nField team reports are in on an aged structure of alien design built on the surface of Tallon IV. Studies show this structure projects a containment field. This field bars access to a prime source of energy within a deep crater. Science Team believes the field is powered by a number of strange Chozo artifacts. We have found some of these relics, and studies on them have begun. As this field could hinder future energy production operations on Tallon IV, we must dismantle it as soon as possible. If this means the destruction of the Chozo artifacts, it will be done.

[A019083C]_001	Phazon Analysis
[A019083C]_002	Log 10.344.8\n\nWe have codified the newfound energy source as Phazon, a V-index mutagen of which we have very little reliable data. Indications point to a meteor of unknown origin expelling Phazon into the environment. This material appears to possess the power to mutate organic life-forms sufficiently to withstand its poison. These mutations appear promising, with abrupt evolutionary leaps appearing in single-generation reproduction. Plans to establish a full Science Team on Tallon IV are being finalized.

Security systems are operational, and Science Team continues to make progress in their biotech research. The Phendrana Drifts have proven to be an optimal location for Research Headquarters, and soon it will be joined by a fully operational combat base and starport. If Command's predictions are half true, we shall rise to dominance in this sector within a decacycle. Truly, these are glorious times.

[EDD1A937]_002	Log 10.444.4\n\nInitial transfer of Metroids to Tallon IV research facilities has been completed. Three were terminated in an incident at the landing site, but the others were pacified and transported safely. Initial Phazon infusion testing is under way. We are eager to observe the effects of Phazon on Metroids, especially their ability to absorb and process the energy given off by Phazon sources. Early research suggests a considerable growth in power and size. Whether the creatures stay stable thereafter remains to be seen.

[268D7A92]_001	Parasite Larva
[268D7A92]_002	Log 10.515.8\n\nOur initial tests exposing Tallon IV's indigenous parasites to Phazon appear to be successful. Increases in strength, size, and aggressiveness are common in all test subjects, as well as unforeseen evolutions like additional poison sacs within the abdomen and the appearance of a second ring of mandibles in several subjects. These creatures were chosen because of their resilience, and it appears possible that, given enough exposure to Phazon, they may one day be able to survive on any planet we transport them to. Our methods will have to be refined; we currently have a 100% extinction rate after the fourth infusion period, and most survivors of the third infusion stage are so violent and uncontrollable that they have to be euthanized. Even still, we remain hopeful that further experimentation will result in success.

Daily Phazon yields have increased 44%, and our mining system becomes more streamlined as personnel and equipment flows increase. Several incidents of Phazon-induced madness have been reported, prompting augmented life-support regulations in the deeper chambers. Symptoms include loss of equilibrium, erratic respiration, muscle spasms, and in the most extreme cases, hallucinations. A timeline reassessment for the refinery operation is recommended, as the material proves more unstable than initial analysis indicated.

[1C871BE2]_002	Log 10.664.2\n\nResearch outpost Glacier One in the Phendrana Drifts region of Tallon IV's mountains is operating at 85% capacity. Sub-zero temperatures have made the Metroids sluggish and easy to control, even those well into Phazon-infusion cycles. Cold-containment stasis tanks are sufficient for the juveniles, but some of the larger Metroids have been moved to quarantined caves for safety purposes. Security doors remain an issue, as malfunctions due to ice occur every day. Large predators in the wastes are also a concern, as they continue to kill personnel and breach secure areas. Unfortunately, it has become clear that our containment teams cannot neutralize all of them without a vast increase in munitions and soldiers.

Door records show no unauthorized entries, so we must presume the creatures are either slipping in undetected during daily personnel moves or else finding their way in through subterranean tunnels. We have found many small breaches of this latter sort and plug them wherever we can, but it is unlikely that we will ever achieve full extermination within our current timetable.

Though aggressive, we were able to implement these changes in a cycle. The metamorphosis was painful, but quite successful in the end. Early tests indicate a drastic increase in strength, mobility, and offensive capability. Cybernetic modules and armor plating have been added as well. We believe our creation, now called Meta Ridley, will become the mainstay of our security force, a job he will certainly relish.

[D037E095]_001	Elite Pirates
[D037E095]_002	Log 11.001.9\n\nInitial Project Helix experiments with Space Pirate embryos were disastrous. The Phazon-infusion process degenerated brain tissue even as it augmented muscle mass. None of what we have termed Elite Pirates lived to maturity; the few that survived their infanthood suffered severe psychotic breakdowns as juveniles, killing anything within their zone of perception. Research Team Sclera made a recent breakthrough, in which parasite studies with a Phazon strain code-named Vertigo were highly successful. Since then, we have successfully fused Vertigo Phazon with Space Pirate DNA with great success. The latest batch of Elite Pirates have reached maturity successfully and are ready for field testing and training.

Subject is heavily armed and extremely dangerous. Subject uses a powered armorsuit of unknown design in battle, along with a number of potent Beam and concussive weapons. All combat units are instructed to terminate Aran on sight, preferably in a fashion that will allow salvage of her powered armorsuit and weapons. A considerable bounty will go to the unit who delivers Aran to Command. Dead or alive, it matters not.

The code name for this venture will be 'Project Helix'. Preliminary studies indicate that Phazon infusion could produce radical new Pirate genomes. Benevolent mutation levels are high in current test subjects. Phazon madness is a concern, but refinements in the infusion process should reduce or neutralize the odds of mental degeneration.

[CD32D02D]_001	Impact Crater
[CD32D02D]_002	Log 11.156.9\n\nInvestigations into a possible ingress point for the impact crater continue to meet with failure. The shield of strange energy that protects it is impermeable, and all attempts to tunnel past it have proven fruitless. Our continued futility in this matter is made all the more significant in light of the recent life-form readings we've discovered emanating from deep within the crater. Analysis of the readings indicates that a massive creature is gestating there, absorbing enormous amounts of Phazon from the Phazon core at the heart of the impact crater. This discovery makes accessing the crater doubly important--not only will it open the door to the vast deposits of Phazon within, but it will also lead us to this creature, whatever it may be.

[4BA6A283]_002	Log 11.377.1\n\nAnalysis continues on these cursed Ruins and the Chozo temple that hovers near them. We are now completely certain that the containment field denying us access to the impact crater is linked to strange artifacts that belong in the temple...but we are no closer to finding them or deciphering the riddles that seem to cover every wall of this ruined place. Command grows increasingly anxious for a resolution to this matter, so we must redouble our efforts. X-ray squadrons will begin terrain sweeps within days--until they begin, patrols are instructed to report any and all architectural anomalies to their commanders.

[80FA7126]_001	Artifact
[80FA7126]_002	Log 11.402.5\n\nWe have come to another dead end. It is clear now that we will never discover the locations of the Chozo's artifacts until we can decipher the messages carved into the statues in this abominable temple. Our language databases are woefully inadequate, and our linguistic analysts can come up with little more than vague theories. The best hypothesis that we can offer is that finding artifacts will require items spiritually linked to the Chozo civilization. However, without these items, we are lost, and Command grows more impatient by the day. Results must be produced soon. 
[71ACC3F3]_000	Space Pirate encrypted data decoded.\n
[71ACC3F3]_001	Omega Pirate
[71ACC3F3]_002	Log 11.232.8\n\nElite Pirate Upsilon's propensity for Phazon has enabled our research team to infuse it far beyond our safety restrictions, and the results have been extremely encouraging. Its constant Phazon diet has increased its mass exponentially, but it has retained all mental faculties and shows dexterity with all Elite weaponry, including plasma incendiary launchers and the chameleon manta issued for cloaking purposes. Elite Pirate Upsilon exhibits miraculous healing abilities; when injured, it seeks out Phazon deposits and coats itself in the substance, which instantly mends the creature's wounds. The subject, which we are code-naming Omega Pirate based on these developments, shows potential to be a new standard for our armies. Our only concern at this point is its potential overdependence on Phazon.

[BAF01056]_001	Mining Operations
[BAF01056]_002	Log 11.242.3\n\nPrevious problems with power supplies in the mining operation have been solved, and we are back on schedule. By shunting thermal energy from the lava flows in the Magmoor Caverns region of Tallon IV, we now have the means to run all of the earth-moving and Phazon-refinement machinery stationed in the caves surrounding the impact crater. Once the operation is running smoothly, we will be able to make projections on Phazon yields and predict if we will be able to leach enough of the substance from the earth to suit the requests of research labs Hydra and Aether. Additionally, three teams of deep-earth Harrowers have already begun sealing off several of the Phazon-rich caves for use as Metroid farms.

[AC175B03]_002	Log 11.369.4\n\nAs we continue to observe the development of Project Helix's Elite Pirates, it becomes increasingly obvious that these warriors will usher in a new era of Space Pirate dominance. They are incredibly resistant to damage, and their ability to transport and wield so many weapons at once makes them the ideal mainstays of our ground forces. Though they are not as quick as typical Pirates, it makes little difference. With a platoon of Elite Pirates in the vanguard of an army of normal and Flying Pirates, we will have a near-indestructible backbone that should turn the tide in any engagement.

[674B88A6]_001	Metroid Morphology
[674B88A6]_002	Log 11.420.7\n\nMetroid dissection continues to provide more questions than answers. Our research teams have isolated the energy conduits that run from the invasive twin mandibles to the energy core in the creature's quadripartite nucleus, but the manner in which a Metroid actually extracts the life force from its prey remains an utter mystery. The victim does not lose blood or any other vital fluids, and yet the Metroid extracts energy; identifying this energy is our central problem. It takes no physical form, and yet without it, the victim dies. We will continue to research this matter, as the isolation of this life-giving essence could be the key to our ascendance.

[E1DFFA08]_001	Metroid Forces
[E1DFFA08]_002	Log 11.550.6\n\nStudies of Metroid biology continue, though with limited progress. It seems likely that we will be much more successful using the Metroids for our means rather than trying to reproduce their powers. If they could be adequately tamed, we would have no need of a proper understanding of their metabolism. A small force of disciplined Metroids could wipe out entire armies, and once we find a way to shield them from cold-containment weapons, they will be invincible. Furthermore, if we could then harvest the energy they'd consumed, we would have a near-limitless source of power at our disposal.

[2A8329AD]_002	Log 11.042.6\n\nThe devastation of Tallon IV's environment wreaks havoc on electrical systems, especially those related to power production. Dynamo and generator malfunctions have been alarmingly high since operations were established. Upon Science Team's recommendation, we have begun to phase out conventional power production, switching to geothermal power as we do. The Magmoor region is a prime source of geothermal energy, one we shall readily exploit. Initial operations are ahead of schedule, thanks to the fact that Magmoor's cave network runs below most of our sites on Tallon IV. We should be fully operational by the end of the quarter.

Command would dearly enjoy turning Aran's weapons against her. We believe we can implement Beam weapon prototypes in three cycles. Aran's Power Suit technology remains a mystery, especially the curious Morph Ball function. All attempts at duplicating it have ended in disaster; four test subjects were horribly broken and twisted when they engaged our Morph Ball prototypes. Science Team wisely decided to move on afterward.

[FCDACAB0]_002	Log 11.440.4\n\nResults are in from field studies on the bioform group Chozo, who we believe are extinct. We believe that Tallon IV was once a stronghold in a great Chozo empire, brought low by the meteor strike. Planetary devastation brought an end to the Chozo, yet remnants of their society remain. We are studying these relics in an attempt to harness their power. What is of no use to us, we destroy. In time, we shall have all we need from this dead race and shall wipe this planet clean of their ugly Ruins. The dead should serve the living, not hinder them.

[7A4EB81E]_001	The Key
[7A4EB81E]_002	Log 11.452.8\n\nAlthough we are still no closer to finding the artifacts of the Chozo, we have at least produced a viable hypothesis for their function. It appears that each of the artifacts corresponds to one of the statues on the temple platform, and that each one acts as a small key to a huge lock. Judging by the number of statues, we assume there must be twelve artifacts. Once we find the resting spots of all twelve, we can bring them here, unite them with their statues, and open the gate system at long last. Once we do, the impact crater--and whatever creature it shelters--will be ours for the taking.

[B1126BBB]_001	Chozo Ghosts
[B1126BBB]_002	Log 11.664.2\n\nThere have been numerous incidents involving spectral entities at Chozo Ruins sites. Several personnel have been assaulted by these Chozo Ghosts; few have survived. Survivors speak of swift attacks from nowhere, brief sightings of the enemy, then nothing, only to be followed by another attack. Science Team believes these attacks are in response to our efforts to recover Chozo relics and artifacts. Somehow, these entities are able to interact with the physical world, and it appears they wish to keep their artifacts to themselves. We will make them pay for such arrogance, for even ghosts can be destroyed.

Use it to pull small objects in.\n\nThere are Charge Combo enhancements scattered through the environment.  They use the Charge Beam and the Missile Launcher in tandem to fire more effective blasts.\n\nThe Charge Beam increases the performance of each Arm Cannon mode.\n
[500EC6A0]_BeamComboDescription	The {color[89d6ffff]}Charge Combos{color[000000ff]} allow you to fire the Missile Launcher and Arm Cannon together. The combined attacks are stronger than normal blasts.\n\nThe Arm Cannon must be charged to use a Charge Combo.\n\nWhen your Arm Cannon is charged, press {[0100|06cd]} to fire the Charge Combo.\n\n{color[89d6ffff]}Samus's Notes:{color[000000ff]}\nThe {color[89d6ffff]}Single Shot{color[000000ff]} Charge Combos fire one blast at a time. Each shot uses a number of Missiles.\n\n{color[89d6ffff]}Sustained Fire{color[000000ff]} Charge Combos will fire as long as the Missile supply lasts. Hold {[0100|30cd]} down after firing. It takes 10 Missiles to trigger these Charge Combos, then 5 Missiles per second afterward.\n\nPage down for information on the individual Charge Combos. \n\nThis data will download to the Log Book after each Charge Combo is acquired. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
