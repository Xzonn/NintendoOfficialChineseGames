ep_30	Mario! {[0100|fa000000]}Look out there!{[0100|fa000000]} Rogueport's\npositively shining!{[0100|fa000000]} It's so beautiful!{b}
ep_31	Oh wow—that's wild, Bro!{[0100|fa000000]} You had a\npretty rough time of it, didn't you?{b}
ep_32	But now that Peach is safe, I guess\neverything's OK.{b}{[0004]}Really, though, how amazing is it\nthat you saved the world again?{[0100|fa000000]}\nAGAIN, Bro!{b}{[0004]}And say, it's been a little while\nsince then...{[0100|fa000000]} Are you ready for\na new adventure?{b}
ep_33	Yeah, you the man, Bro!{[0100|fa000000]} I wonder\nwhat everyone who traveled with\nyou is up to?{b}

ep_35	Dear Mario,\nWhat's up? Goombella here!{b}{[0004]}I'm still here working with\nProfessor Frankly.{b}{[0004]}We beat the Shadow Queen, but\nthere's tons of Rogueport lore we\nstill don't get...{b}{[0004]}So my research with the professor\ngoes on and on.{b}
ep_36	With the info I gathered with you, we\nhave lots of great leads now though!{b}{[0004]}Mario...

mac_4_068	But not all good things can last.\n{[0100|f4010000]}It was a particularly icy winter\nwhen it happened...{b}{[0004]}Scarlette fell ill. {[0100|fa000000]}A virus?{[0100|fa000000]} A passing\ncold?{[0100|fa000000]} No one knew, but it soon\nturned serious.{b}{[0004]}Bobbery, at sea on a long, lonely\nvoyage, knew nothing of his\nbride's suffering.{b}{[0004]}By the time he returned, Scarlette\nhad succumbed.{[0100|f4010000]} She was gone.{b}{[0004]}Bobbery, of course, blamed himself.{[0100|fa000000]}\n"My loving wife perished because\nof me...{b}{[0004]}"If I were not at sea, I could have\nnursed her to health.{[0100|fa000000]} I could have\nsaved her."{b}{[0004]}He was overcome with such thoughts.{[0100|64000000]}\nThey tormented him always, haunting\nhis sleep.{b}{[0004]}He has never gone out to sea since.{b}
mac_4_069_kur	That's...{[0100|64000000]}*sniff*...{[0100|64000000]}the saddest tale I've\never heard in my life.{[0100|fa000000]} No wonder...{b}
mac_4_069_nok	Oh man... {[0100|64000000]}Now I'm depressed.{[0100|fa000000]}\nSo that's his reason...{b}
mac_4_069_win	Oh, that poor dear! {[0100|fa000000]}How indescribably\nawful for him!{[0100|fa000000]} Now I understand...{b}
mac_4_069_yos	Gee... {[0100|64000000]}What a downer.{[0100|fa000000]} I guess that's\na pretty good reason for hating\nthe ocean...{b}
mac_4_069_viv	I can't imagine what that poor\nman went through...{[0100|fa000000]} No wonder\nhe won't sail...{b}
mac_4_069_chu	Why must romance so often end\nin tragedy? {[0100|64000000]}Why?!{[0100|fa000000]} I see why he\nwon't sail...{b}
mac_4_070	You all know his tale now...{[0100|fa000000]} So, tell\nme—{[0100|32000000]}do you still want him to return\nto the sea?{[0101]}
mac_4_070_yesno	{[010d|00000000ffffffff9600000028000000]}Yes... We have no choice.\nNo. He's suffered enough.
mac_4_071	You wish him to sail again,\nno matter the cost to him?{[0100|fa000000]}\nNo matter what it takes?{[0101]}
mac_4_072	In that case, let the miserable old\nsoul be, and make your way\nwithout him.{b}
mac_4_073	Very well. {[0100|fa000000]}I understand.{[0100|fa000000]} If you're that\ndetermined, then I'll give you this...{b}
mac_4_075	On her deathbed, Scarlette wrote\nBobbery a final letter.{[0100|fa000000]} You hold it\nin your hands.{b}{[0004]}I don't know what's written inside...{[0100|fa000000]}\nbut I can tell you what she told me\nas she lay dying.{b}{[0004]}"If I should succumb to this plague,\nand if my love should blame himself\nfor my death...{b}{[0004]}"Then give this letter to him, so\nhe may hear my voice."{[0100|fa000000]} It was her\nlast request.{b}{[0004]}But when I saw Bobbery in misery,\ntrying to forget the pain as he\nmourned his wife...{b}{[0004]}I just couldn't bring myself to present\nthis letter to him.{[0100|fa000000]} I've regretted it\never since.{b}
mac_4_076	Please...{b}{[0004]}Take this letter, and do the deed\nI was too cowardly to do—{[0100|32000000]}take it\nto Bobbery.{b}
mac_4_077_kur	Thanks, Podley. {[0100|fa000000]}And don't beat\nyourself up for this.{[0100|fa000000]} We'll deliver\nthe letter.{b}{[0004]}C'mon, Mario.{[0101]}{b}

irai_20_030	Oh, my Eve...{[0100|20030000]}
irai_20_031	Is that all you needed?{[0100|fa000000]} Because I'm\na little busy.{b}
irai_25_00_1	General White?{[0100|fa000000]} Yeah, I spoke to him\njust a second ago, actually.{b}{[0004]}We're old buddies, he and I.{b}{[0004]}I've known him since he was a little\nsnapper that would explode over\nany little thing!{b}{[0004]}Then again, I was the kind of\nguy that would bonk people for\nsmiling funny...{b}{[0004]}Still, he turned out to be a fine\nBob-omb, though he never cured\nthat wanderlust!{b}{[0004]}I'm pretty sure he said he was off\nto Glitzville next.{b}{[0004]}I go back pretty far with the guy that\nruns the juice shop there too.{b}{[0004]}So give him my best!{b}
irai_25_00_2	General White?{[0100|fa000000]} I'm pretty sure he\nsaid he was off to Glitzville next.{b}{[0004]}I go back pretty far with the guy that\nruns the juice shop there too.{b}{[0004]}So give him my best!{b}
mac_0_062	Oops! Pardon me, sucker!{[0100|ee020000]}

mac_0_067	Ah.{[0100|fa000000]} Yes.{[0100|fa000000]} You.{[0100|fa000000]} Now, you, uh...{b}{[0004]}Wait for it...{[0100|fa000000]} Just a moment...{[0100|fa000000]} Don't\ntell me, now! {[0100|fa000000]}Silence!{[0100|fa000000]} I'll get it right!{b}
mac_0_067_01	Umm...{[0100|fa000000]} It's not Goombriel...{b}
mac_0_067_02	Errr...{[0100|fa000000]} It's not Elizagoom...{b}

mac_0_067_06	{[0307|00004040]}You're Goombella, aren't you?{[0307|0000803f]}{[0100|fa000000]}\nYou were in my archaeology\nclass last year, am I right?{b}

mac_0_069	Of course I remember you.{[0100|fa000000]} Not to\ntoot my horn, but I'm pretty good\nat remembering.{b}{[0004]}You though... {[0100|fa000000]}You stick out in my\nmind because you were such an\nexceptional student.{b}{[0004]}And that guy behind you is...{b}

mac_0_069_02	Mario! {[0100|fa000000]}Professor, he's Mario!{[0100|fa000000]}\nYou know...{[0100|fa000000]}the famous one!{b}
mac_0_069_03	Oh! My apologies.{[0100|fa000000]} I'm such a\nbookworm, I haven't a clue about\nwhat's "hip" right now.{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}In any case, what sort of errand\nbrings you two all the way to a\nplace like this?{b}
mac_0_070_kur	We were hoping you'd tell us about\nthe legendary treasure said to be\nbelow Rogueport!{b}{[0004]}I thought that if anyone knew\nanything about it, you would,\nProfessor Frankly...{b}
mac_0_071	Of course I know about it.{[0100|fa000000]}\nThe reason I came here was\nto study that very subject.{b}{[0004]}But why do you tykes want to learn\nabout the legendary treasure?{b}{[0004]}You know that most say it's little\nmore than a fairy tale, don't you?{b}
mac_0_072_kur	Archaeologists and historians have\nto search for truth in those fairy\ntales though!{b}{[0004]}Me, I believe the legendary treasure\ntruly does exist!{[0100|fa000000]} And I REALLY want\nto find it!{b}
mac_0_073	Good point! {[0100|fa000000]}And well made!{[0100|fa000000]} In that\ncase, I'll cooperate with you however\nI can.{b}{[0004]}First of all, we should start by\naddressing just what the legendary\ntreasure is...{b}
mac_0_073_01	Some say it's an infinitely vast\ntreasure hoard, while others say\nit's a magical item.{b}{[0004]}Some books say it's actually a\nmonster, while still others claim\nit's an empty chest...{b}{[0004]}So many different theories...{[0100|fa000000]}\nObviously, it's impossible to\ndivine the truth among them.{b}{[0004]}But all agree on one point—{[0100|fa000000]}to find\nthe treasure, one must have {[0110]}{[0100|5e010000]}\x0f\x01\x10{[0101]}the\n{color[e61b00cc]}Crystal Stars{color[000000b2]}!{b}
mac_0_074_kur	The Crystal Stars?!{b}
mac_0_075	"To find the treasure of yore, take\nthe seven Crystal Stars to the\n{color[e61b00cc]}Thousand-Year Door{color[000000b2]}."{b}{[0004]}That's how the old saying goes...{[0100|fa000000]}\nand with a rhyme that solid, it\nMUST be true!{b}{[0004]}Therefore, if you want to find the\nlegendary treasure, you first must\ncollect the seven Crystal Stars.{b}
mac_0_076_kur	Oh! Hey!{[0100|64000000]} I researched some of the\nwritten lore behind the treasure, and\nit kinda matches that old saying...{b}{[0004]}"Hold the {color[e61b00cc]}Magical Map{color[000000b2]} aloft\nbefore the entrance to the\nThousand-Year Door.{b}{[0004]}"Then the stars will light the\nway that leads to the stones\nof yesterday."{b}{[0004]}The "stones of yesterday"...{b}\nIs that referring to the same\nCrystal Stars you mentioned?{b}
mac_0_077	It must be!{[0100|fa000000]} And we're in luck—it seems\nthe Thousand-Year Door is located\nsomewhere beneath this very town!{b}{[0004]}Yet the critical piece of the puzzle—\nthe Magical Map—is lost.{[0100|fa000000]} If only we\nhad that map!{b}
mac_0_078_kur	But we DO have it, Professor!{[0100|f4010000]} Or...{[0100|fa000000]}\nWell, not "we," exactly...{[0100|fa000000]} MARIO has\nthe Magical Map!{b}

mac_0_080	{[0307|00004040]}Astounding! {[0100|fa000000]}This is it!{[0100|fa000000]} The real thing!{[0100|fa000000]}\nThe one and only Magical Map!{b}
mac_0_081	{[0307|00004040]}You, son, are my HERO!{[0100|fa000000]} You're great!{[0100|fa000000]}\nFantastic!{[0100|fa000000]} WONDERFUL, even!{[0307|0000803f]}{b}{[0004]}With this map...{[0100|fa000000]}we can locate the\nCrystal Stars just by holding it up in\nfront of the Thousand-Year Door!{b}
mac_0_081_01_kur	Right on, Professor!{b}
mac_0_082	Good golly, what are we doing just\nsitting here, then?!{[0100|fa000000]} Goombella!{[0100|fa000000]} Mario!{b}{[0004]}Let's take the Magical Map to the\nThousand-Year Door!{b}{[0004]}{[0307|00004040]}Off we must go, this instant!{[0307|0000803f]}{[0100|fa000000]} I'll lead\nthe way to the sewers underneath\nthe town!
mac_0_083	I bet you didn't know this rotten old\nthing came off, did you? {[0100|fa000000]}Heh heh!{b}
mac_0_084	We can use this pipe to get down\nunder the city streets!{b}{[0004]}Come on! {[0100|fa000000]}Both of you!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's\nget moving!{b}
mac_0_084_01	Oh wait, hang on a second...{[0100|2c010000]} Mario!{[0100|fa000000]}\nSomething just occurred to me.{b}
mac_0_084_02	I'm fairly certain there are quite a\nfew hoodlums below.{[0100|fa000000]} So, uh...{[0100|fa000000]}keep\nyour guard up.{b}{[0004]}Would you two like to practice your\n{color[e61b00cc]}Action Commands{color[000000b2]} before we descend?{[0100|fa000000]}\nThey're the basics of battle after all!{[0101]}
mac_0_084_02_yesno	{[010d|00000000010000009600000028000000]}Of course!\nNope.
mac_0_084_03	Really? {[0100|fa000000]}A master, are you?{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe\nyou ought to practice them once,\njust to be safe?{[0101]}
mac_0_084_03_yesno	{[010d|00000000010000009600000028000000]}OK, fine.\nNo, I'm good.
mac_0_084_04	A bold young lad, aren't you!{[0100|fa000000]} A quick\nrefresher: when your partner attacks,\nmatch what's shown on the screen.{b}{[0004]}When guarding, press {color[d33431ff]} {color[000000b2]}in time with\nyour opponent's attack.{[0100|fa000000]} If you can\nremember that, you'll be fine.{b}{[0004]}Right. Now, down we go!{b}{[0004]}Just stand on the pipe and press {color[d33431ff]}{color[000000b2]}\nto enter it.{b}
mac_0_084_05	Good call!{[0100|fa000000]} In that case, let's have a\nlittle practice session.{b}{[0004]}Goombella,{[0100|fa000000]} you can be\nMario's opponent.{b}
mac_0_084_06	What?!{[0100|64000000]} Me? {[0100|fa000000]}Are you serious?!{b}{[0004]}{[0100|fa000000]}Oh, gee, ummmmmm... {[0100|fa000000]}Uh,{[0100|64000000]} OK.{[0100|fa000000]}\nI'll do my best, I guess!{b}
mac_0_b_t2_000	First, we'll practice the Jump\nAction Command.{[0100|fa000000]} That OK with\nthe both of you?{b}{[0004]}Choose the Jump command, then\nchoose which enemy you'll attack.{b}
mac_0_b_t2_001	When you choose a command, the\nAction Command details will be shown\nat the bottom of the screen.{[0004]}For the Action Command "Jump,"\npress {color[d33431ff]} {color[000000b2]}at the exact moment you\nstomp on an opponent.{[0100|fa000000]} Give it a go!
mac_0_b_t2_027	Too late!
mac_0_b_t2_028	Perfect!
mac_0_b_t2_029	Too soon!
mac_0_b_t2_025	Well, well! You got a "Nice!" rating!\nThe Action Command was a success.
mac_0_b_t2_026	Oops. You didn't get a "Nice!" so\nyou failed the Action Command...{[0100|fa000000]}\nShake it off and try again!
mac_0_b_t2_035	Succeeding at Action Commands will\nincrease the damage you deal to your\nopponents...or do other good stuff!
mac_0_b_t2_004	Now it's your turn to attack,\nGoombella. {[0100|fa000000]}Shake a leg!{b}
mac_0_b_t2_005	OK...{[0100|fa000000]} Here goes, Mario!{b}
mac_0_b_t2_006	Get ready, Mario!{[0100|fa000000]} Press {color[d33431ff]}{color[000000b2]} just before\nyour enemy strikes you.
mac_0_b_t2_031	Ah, well done! You pulled off a {color[e61b00cc]}Guard{color[000000b2]}\nAction Command!{[0100|2c010000]} That will decrease\nthe damage you receive from attacks.{[0004]}Just mashing {color[d33431ff]} {color[000000b2]}won't be enough.{[0100|fa000000]}\nSuccess requires timing!
mac_0_b_t2_030	Oops...{[0100|64000000]}you failed the {color[e61b00cc]}Guard {color[000000b2]}Action\nCommand.{[0100|fa000000]} {[0100|fa000000]}Go on, Goombella!{[0100|64000000]} Give it\nanother try!
mac_0_b_t2_007	Action Commands change depending\non the attack.{b}{[0004]}Best to stay on your toes, eh?{[0100|fa000000]}\nAnyway, next let's practice\n{color[e61b00cc]}Hammer {color[000000b2]}Action Commands.{b}{[0004]}After you select Hammer, choose who\nyou want to attack.
mac_0_b_t2_008	Once you get close to your opponent,\ntilt  to the left.{[0004]}Then release  at the same time\nyou see {color[ff0000ff]} {color[000000b2]}flash!
mac_0_b_t2_011	Stop there!{[0004]}How did that feel, Mario?{[0100|fa000000]} Got a\npretty good grasp on Action\nCommands now?{b}
mac_0_b_t2_012	Excellent. {[0100|fa000000]}Now for a real treat—\nI'll teach you a really incredible\ntechnique!{b}
mac_0_b_t2_033	Goombella,{[0100|fa000000]} try to attack Mario\none more time.{b}
mac_0_b_t2_013	You got it, Professor!{b}
mac_0_b_t2_014	Freeze right there, Mario!{[0100|fa000000]} Press {color[dca921ff]}{color[000000b2]}\nat the exact moment the enemy\nattack lands.{[0101]}
mac_0_b_t2_036	This time, press {color[dca921ff]}{color[000000b2]} at the exact\nmoment the enemy attack lands.
mac_0_b_t2_015	Yeeeowch!{[0100|f4010000]}
mac_0_b_t2_032	Oops...{[0100|96000000]} You failed the Superguard.{b}{[0004]}Try to press {color[dca921ff]} {color[000000b2]}with even tighter\ntiming than Guard.
mac_0_b_t2_034	Now then, Goombella...{[0100|2c010000]}try to attack\nMario once more.
mac_0_b_t2_016	See? {[0100|fa000000]}You turned the foe's attack\nback on him!{[0100|64000000]} I mean, her!{[0100|fa000000]} That's\na {color[e61b00cc]}Superguard{color[000000b2]}!{b}{[0004]}If you do a Superguard with {color[dca921ff]}{color[000000b2]}, you\ntake no damage...{[0100|fa000000]}AND damage your\nenemy in return.{b}{[0004]}But...{[0100|fa000000]}Superguards are harder to do\nthan standard {color[d33431ff]}{color[000000b2]} guards.{[0100|fa000000]} Choose\nwisely between them.{b}
mac_0_b_t2_017	And that concludes Action\nCommands 101!{[0100|96000000]} Har har har!{[0100|96000000]}\nSorry... {[0100|fa000000]}Professorial humor.{b}{[0004]}How'd that go over? {[0100|64000000]}Would you like\nto practice your Action Commands\na bit more?{[0101]}
mac_0_b_t2_018	{[010d|00000000ffffffff9600000028000000]}Stop for now.\nContinue.
mac_0_b_t2_019	Smart move. {[0100|fa000000]}It takes hard work\nto fully master all the different\nAction Commands.{b}{[0004]}Whenever you want to quit\npracticing, just choose the\nQuit command.{b}
mac_0_b_t2_020	I expected nothing less, Mario!{[0100|fa000000]}\nYou're a quick learner!{[0100|fa000000]} You're\nalready a pro, I'm sure!{b}
mac_0_b_t2_024	OK.{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe we should stop practicing\nfor now.{b}
mac_0_084_07	Well, I do believe now we're all set for\nour quest, hmm?{[0100|fa000000]} Down below we go!{b}{[0004]}Hop up onto the pipe and press {color[d33431ff]}{color[000000b2]}\nto enter it.{b}
mac_0_102	Hrmmm...{[0100|fa000000]} Aha! I see!{b}
mac_0_103_kur	You understand it, Professor?{b}
mac_0_103_01	Ah, Mario!{[0100|fa000000]} There's something I forgot\nto mention.{b}{[0004]}Firstly, about that light we saw\nshining on you...{b}{[0004]}By my reckoning, Mario can now\nperform what is known as a\n{color[e61b00cc]}special move{color[000000b2]}.{b}
mac_0_103_02_kur	A special move?{b}
mac_0_103_03	Yes, it... {[0100|64000000]}Well...{[0100|fa000000]} Stuff like this is\nbetter explained by example\nrather than words.{b}{[0004]}Would you like to try it out?{[0101]}
mac_0_103_03_yesno	{[010d|00000000010000009600000028000000]}Sure thing.\nNo, thanks.
mac_0_103_04	This is VERY important.{[0100|fa000000]} You'd better\nlisten.{[0100|fa000000]} I mean it.{[0100|fa000000]} Are you ready\nto listen?{[0101]}
mac_0_103_05	Excellent!{[0100|fa000000]} In that case, let's give your\nspecial move a little test run!{b}
mac_0_b_t3_000	First, take a close look at your\nStar Power gauge.{b}
mac_0_b_t3_001	You'll see that your gauge has one\npower dot.{[0100|fa000000]} Obviously that's a single\nunit of power.{b}{[0004]}So you're sitting on a single dot of\nStar Power.{[0100|fa000000]} With me so far?{b}{[0004]}When you have Star Power available,\nyou can use a special move.{b}{[0004]}Try using Sweet Treat now.{[0100|fa000000]} It's a\nspecial move that will replenish\nyour HP and FP.{b}
mac_0_b_t3_003	Since you used one power dot, the\nStar Power gauge is now empty.{b}
mac_0_b_t3_004	Even if the gauge empties out,\nthough, you can still charge it\nup again.{b}{[0004]}That's why the audience watching\nyour battles is so very important.{b}
mac_0_b_t3_005	If you can get the audience excited,\nyou'll build up more Star Power.{b}{[0004]}Let me show you what I mean.{[0100|fa000000]} Mario,{[0100|64000000]}\nGoombella...{[0100|fa000000]} Try to attack me, please.{b}
mac_0_b_t3_006	Nice! {[0100|fa000000]}See that?{[0100|fa000000]} You thrilled your\naudience, so they filled up some\nof your gauge.{b}
mac_0_b_t3_007	Nice! {[0100|fa000000]}Keep building up that\nStar Power.{b}{[0004]}Also, the more exciting your battles\nare, the more people will come to\nwatch you fight!{b}{[0004]}As you can see, that's reflected\nin the number of members in\nthis audience.{b}
mac_0_b_t3_008	That won't do.{[0100|fa000000]} Perform like that and\nthe audience will feel ripped off,\ntrust me.{b}{[0004]}You have to execute your\nAction Commands! {[0100|fa000000]}Don't get\nstage fright, now!{b}
mac_0_b_t3_009	That's no good!{[0100|fa000000]} Come on!{b}{[0004]}If you don't perform your Action\nCommands, people will stop coming\nto see you.{b}
mac_0_b_t3_010	Not quite!{[0100|fa000000]} Keep trying!{b}
mac_0_b_t3_014	Still with me?{[0100|fa000000]} The more people in\nyour audience, the more Star Power\nyou can get.{b}{[0004]}You can also use the {color[e61b00cc]}Appeal{color[000000b2]}\ncommand to get Star Power.{[0100|fa000000]}\nI hope you memorized all this!{b}
mac_0_b_t3_015	Well, that's all I've got!{[0100|fa000000]} Here ends my\nscintillating lecture on special moves.{b}{[0004]}Fine work, Mario!{b}
mac_0_103_06	Hmm... {[0100|fa000000]}You're absolutely sure?{[0100|fa000000]} Well,\nall right.{[0100|64000000]} Just remember...{[0100|fa000000]}in battle,\nthe bigger your audience, the better.{b}
mac_0_104	Of course I do...{[0100|64000000]}and I shall explain!{[0100|fa000000]}\nThe first thing to know is...{b}{[0004]}{[0307|00004040]}THIS MAP IS TRULY ASTOUNDING!{[0307|0000803f]}{b}{[0004]}Somehow, this map contains\nradar-like functions! {[0100|fa000000]}It's showing\nus the location of a Crystal Star!{b}{[0004]}It looks like the first Crystal Star\nis to be found in a place called...\n{color[e61b00cc]}Petal Meadows{color[000000b2]}.{b}
mac_0_105_kur	Petal Meadows?{b}
mac_0_106	Yes. {[0100|fa000000]}The area is a vast meadow that\nlies far to the east of Rogueport.{b}{[0004]}To tell you the truth...{[0100|fa000000]}I've always\nthought that place was a tad\nsuspicious.{b}{[0004]}The name Petal Meadows did come up\nfrom time to time in my research.{b}
mac_0_107_kur	OK, fine.{[0100|64000000]} So we'll go there.{[0100|fa000000]} Does\nanybody know how to get there\nor what?{b}
mac_0_108	I'm fairly certain that somewhere\nbeneath the city is a pipe to\nPetal Meadows.{b}{[0004]}If you could just find that,\nyou'd get there instantly.{[0100|fa000000]}\nPipe travel's efficient!{b}
mac_0_109	Say, by the way, Mario...{[0100|fa000000]} I'm curious.{[0100|64000000]}\nHow did you get that map, anyway?{b}
mac_0_110	From Princess Peach?{[0100|64000000]} Really?{[0100|fa000000]} Her\nHighness sent this to you, Mario?{[0101]}{b}{[0004]}This Princess Peach...{[0100|fa000000]}\nThis wouldn't be her,\nwould it?{[0101]}{[0108|0e0063005f00700065006100630068000a0050005f005a005f0031005e010000370000009a99993e00000000]}{[0100|f4010000]}{b}
mac_0_111	{[0203]}{[0307|00004040]}{[0200]}{size[fa00]}So it IS her!{size[6400]}\x0f\x02\0{[0307|0000803f]}{[0101]}{b}{[0004]}Your princess came to see me the\nother day.{[0100|fa000000]} She wanted to learn\nabout the treasure...{b}{[0004]}I told her about the Crystal Stars and\nmy suspicions about Petal Meadows...{b}{[0004]}It doesn't seem likely, but perhaps\nshe tried to go to Petal Meadows\non her own...{[0101]}{b}
mac_0_112_kur	Y'know, Professor, there was another\nsuspicious group asking about the\nsame thing.{b}
mac_0_113	{[030a|01000000]}Hrmm...{[030a|00000000]}{[0100|fa000000]} But I can't imagine Princess\nPeach getting involved with THEM...{b}
mac_0_114	{[0307|00004040]}All right! It's settled!{[0307|0000803f]}{[0100|fa000000]} Off to Petal\nMeadows you two go!{[0101]}{b}{[0004]}If Princess Peach indeed went there,\nyour first priority must be to catch\nup to her.{b}{[0004]}Collecting the Crystal Stars is a\nmeans to an end...{[0100|64000000]}and that end\nis Princess Peach!{b}
mac_0_117_kur	Aren't you coming, Professor?{b}
mac_0_118	No, I'll stay in town and ask around\nabout Princess Peach and that\nsuspicious gang.{b}{[0004]}Besides, I doubt a shriveled old\nGoomba like me could handle the\ntrials of the road.{b}{[0004]}Of course, if anything happens\nand you need some advice,\ncome see me, OK?{b}
mac_0_119_kur	You got it, Professor!{b}
mac_0_120_kur	Well, Mario, {[0100|fa000000]}we're off!{[0101]}{b}
mac_0_120_01	Give it your best!{[0004]}Now then...{[0100|fa000000]}allow me to give you both\na proper farewell.
mac_0_121_06	Mario, it's scary out there.{[0100|fa000000]} Take this\nwith you.{b}
mac_0_121_02	It's called a {color[e61b00cc]}badge{color[000000b2]}, and it is\nincredibly helpful.{b}{[0004]}You see, depending on the badges\nyou have equipped, you'll get much\nmore powerful.{b}{[0004]}What's important is knowing what\nthe effects will be when you first\nequip a badge.{b}{[0004]}Would you like to practice equipping\nand removing badges?{[0101]}
mac_0_121_02_yesno	{[010d|00000000010000009600000028000000]}Yes, please.\nNo, thanks.
mac_0_121_03	Are you absolutely sure?{[0100|fa000000]}\nThis is the last time I'll ask.\nDo you want practice?{[0101]}
lecture_badge_00	--Equipping and Removing Badges--\nPress  and open the menu.{[0101]}
lecture_badge_02	Press  and open the Badge menu.{[0101]}
lecture_badge_05	Equipping badges requires Badge\nPoints (BP). That one needs 1 BP.{b}{[0101]}
lecture_badge_05_1	Press {color[ffb5b5ff]}{color[ffffffcc]} to equip a badge.{[0101]}
lecture_badge_06	You used 1 BP and equipped \nthe badge!{b}{[0101]}
lecture_badge_06_1	Press {color[ffb5b5ff]} {color[ffffffcc]}again to remove the badge,\nand your BP will return to normal.{b}{[0101]}
lecture_badge_07	That's the whole explanation.\nPress  to close the menu.
mac_0_121_07	I see.{[0100|fa000000]} Then just remember this one\npart for me...{[0100|fa000000]} You must equip badges\nfor them to take effect!{b}{[0101]}
mac_0_121_05	By the way, you need {color[e61b00cc]}Flower Points\n(FP){color[000000b2]} to use the Power Smash move.{b}{[0004]}In battle, you should watch not\nonly your HP but FP too.{[0100|2c010000]} Did you\nget all that?{[0101]}{b}{[0004]}Well, here's hoping you find that pipe\nto Petal Meadows.{b}
mac_1_000	Oh! Galloping Goombas!{[0100|fa000000]} You got a\nCrystal Star!{b}{[0004]}{[0307|00004040]}Magnificent{[0307|0000803f]}, Mario!{[0100|fa000000]} I knew you could\ndo it.{b}{[0004]}First you must take that down to the\nThousand-Year Door.{[0100|fa000000]} Then we'll talk.{b}
mac_1_004	Hrmm...{[0100|fa000000]} Mmmm HRRRRMMMM...{b}
mac_1_005	I see, I see. {[0100|fa000000]}Crystal clear!{b}
mac_1_006_kur	Yeah, great pun.{[0100|64000000]} C'mon!{[0100|64000000]} Where's the\nnext Crystal Star, Professor?{b}
mac_1_006_nok	Um... {[0100|64000000]}So, can you tell us where the\nnext Crystal Star is or not?{b}
mac_1_007	It's in the Boggly Woods.{[0100|fa000000]}\nThe second Crystal Star is\ninside a great tree there.{b}
mac_1_008_kur	A great tree in the Boggly\nWoods? {[0100|64000000]}OK...{b}
mac_1_008_nok	A great tree in the Boggly\nWoods, huh?{b}
mac_1_009	About those woods...{[0100|fa000000]}\nI think...{[0100|fa000000]}some odd\ncreatures live there.{[0101]}{[0108|0c0063005f00700075006e00690006005a005f0031005e010000320000009a99193f00000000]}{[0100|f4010000]}{b}{[0004]}If memory serves, there's a pipe\nbeneath town that leads to\nthose woods.{b}
mac_1_010_kur	By the way, Professor...{[0100|fa000000]} About\nPrincess Peach...{b}{[0004]}Not long ago, Mario received an\nemail from her.{b}{[0004]}It said that the people who\nkidnapped her are also looking\nfor the Crystal Stars.{b}{[0004]}Oh, and the worst part?{[0100|fa000000]} She said\nthat she doesn't even know where\nshe is!{b}
mac_1_010_nok	Um... Professor Frankly...{[0100|fa000000]}\nYou should probably know...{[0100|fa000000]}\nIt's about Princess Peach...{b}{[0004]}Mr. Mario got an email from her\njust recently.{b}{[0004]}Her Highness said that the guys who\nkidnapped her are also hunting\nCrystal Stars.{b}{[0004]}Oh, and she said she doesn't even\nknow where she's being held...{[0100|fa000000]} Yeah.{b}
mac_1_010_01	Uh-oh. If Princess Peach's\nkidnappers are also looking\nfor the Crystal Stars...{b}{[0004]}What could they hope to achieve?{[0100|fa000000]}\nCould the treasure be...{[0100|fa000000]} Ugh!{[0100|64000000]} Too\nmany unknowns!{b}{[0004]}Unfortunately, the only clues we\ncan rely on are the Crystal Stars\nand that map.{b}
mac_1_010_02_kur	Then we'll head for Boggly Woods to\nfind the next Crystal Star! {[0100|64000000]}Let's do it!{b}
mac_1_010_02_nok	Um...{[0100|64000000]} I guess all we can do is head\nto Boggly Woods to find that next\nCrystal Star!{b}
mac_1_010_03	Yes, I recommend you do just that.{[0004]}Try to find it before the princess's\ncaptors.{[0100|fa000000]} Whatever their ultimate\ngoal is, it can't be good.{b}{[0004]}But don't be hasty!{[0100|64000000]} If you're low on\nitems or health, drop by the shop\nand inn first.{b}{[0004]}I'll keep researching to learn more\nabout the Crystal Stars and the\nancient treasure.{b}
mac_2_000	Oh!{[0100|fa000000]} So you managed to get the\nCrystal Star from Boggly Woods\nwithout much trouble?{b}{[0004]}Well, I've learned several vital\nthings, but first, go to the\nThousand-Year Door.{b}
mac_2_002_01	That means that beneath this\ntown, the thousand-year-old ruins\nremain intact.{b}
mac_2_002_02	And that door's been sealed shut\nfor a thousand years by the\nCrystal Stars...{b}{[0004]}In order to open that seal, we have\nto muster the power of all the\nCrystal Stars.{b}
mac_2_002_03_kur	But the question is why did they\nseal the legendary treasure away\nto begin with?{b}{[0004]}I mean, were they just trying to keep\nit from being stolen or what?{b}
mac_2_002_03_nok	But, um... {[0100|64000000]}Why would they need\nto seal the treasure away in the\nfirst place?{b}{[0004]}You think maybe they just wanted to\nprotect it from thieves and robbers?{b}
mac_2_002_03_win	Perhaps I'm just daft, but why would\nthey want to seal this treasure\naway at all?{b}{[0004]}Did they fear thieves and brigands?{[0100|64000000]}\nIf not, then what?{b}
mac_2_002_04	No, that's not...{b}
mac_2_002_05_kur	What? {[0100|64000000]}That's not WHAT?{b}
mac_2_002_05_nok	That's not what?{b}
mac_2_002_05_win	Hm? {[0100|64000000]}That's not what?{b}
mac_2_002_06	{[0203]}{[0307|00004040]}{[0200]}{size[dc00]}I don't KNOW!{size[6400]}\x0f\x02\0{size[dc00]}{b}{size[6400]}
mac_2_002_07_kur	Sheesh, Professor...{b}
mac_2_002_07_nok	Whoa, Professor Frankly!{b}
mac_2_002_07_win	Frankly, please!{b}
mac_2_002	I'm sorry.{[0100|fa000000]} So sorry!{b}{[0004]}I know that the treasure was sealed\naway around the time the town\nwas destroyed...{b}{[0004]}But the problem is... {[0100|64000000]}No one's even\nsure what it was that caused the\ntown's demise.{b}{[0004]}All that's written is this:{[0100|64000000]}\n"Darkness stole the sky and\nthe cataclysm rained down."{b}{[0004]}I must research this more.{[0100|fa000000]} Assuming\nwill just make an...{[0100|fa000000]} Well, you know\nthe saying.{[0101]}{b}
mac_2_003_kur	No, I don't, but whatever.{[0100|fa000000]}{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}How about this next Crystal Star,\nthen? {[0100|64000000]}It's like it's floating on the\nMagical Map...{b}
mac_2_003_nok	Oh yeah, right...{[0100|fa000000]}{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}Anyway, what about the next\nCrystal Star? {[0100|64000000]}It looks like it's\nfloating on that map!{b}
mac_2_003_win	Oh yes.{[0100|90010000]} How inappropriate.{[0100|fa000000]}{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}In any case, what about the location\nof this Crystal Star that's floating\non the map?{b}
mac_2_004	Hmm... Very interesting...{[0100|fa000000]} Perhaps\nit's pointing to the floating town\nof {color[e61b00cc]}Glitzville{color[000000b2]}...{[0101]}{b}{[0004]}There's a stunning arena there\nwhere great warriors engage in\nfurious battles!{b}{[0101]}{[0004]}Ostensibly, families go there on\nvacation to lounge and enjoy\nthe fights, but...{b}{[0004]}Behind the scenes, the richest people\nin the world wager on the bouts.{b}
mac_2_005_kur	It's, like...floating?{b}{[0004]}Well, how are we supposed to get\nthere, then?{b}
mac_2_005_nok	Um... {[0100|64000000]}If it's a floating city...{b}{[0004]}How the heck are we supposed\nto get there?{b}
mac_2_005_win	A floating city, you say?{b}{[0004]}So, are we just supposed to sprout\nwings and fly there, darling?{[0100|fa000000]} Do tell.{b}
mac_2_006	A special blimp flies there...{[0100|fa000000]} It departs\nfrom Rogueport several times a day.{b}{[0004]}The problem is getting a seat.{[0100|fa000000]}\nThe only way to get a ticket is\nthrough certain "channels"...{b}
mac_2_007_kur	What?{[0100|64000000]} What "channels"?{[0100|64000000]} Stop being\nmysterious!{[0100|64000000]} How do we get seats\non the ship?{b}
mac_2_007_nok	Well, that doesn't sound hard.{[0100|fa000000]}\nAnyone can use these "channels,"\nright? {[0100|90010000]}Right?{b}
mac_2_007_win	Ooh! {[0100|64000000]}That sounds exciting!{[0100|64000000]} A little...\non the seedy side.{[0100|64000000]} Show me the way!{b}
mac_2_008	Hrmmmmmmm... {[0100|64000000]}I don't know...{[0100|64000000]} But I\nguess we don't have much choice.{b}{[0004]}Word on the street is all tickets go\nthrough Don Pianta on the west side.{b}
mac_2_009	Head west from Rogueport's main\nsquare and you'll reach the side of\ntown controlled by Don Pianta.{b}{[0004]}He's the Pianta syndicate head,\nand I heard he makes pretty regular\njaunts over to Glitzville.{b}
mac_2_010_kur	So, no problem!{[0100|64000000]} We'll just go meet\nthis Don Pianta guy, and we'll be\non our way!{b}
mac_2_010_nok	Well, hey, that sounds easy!{[0100|fa000000]}\nWe just have to talk to this\nDon Pianta person.{b}
mac_2_010_win	Mmmm... {[0100|64000000]}I like the sound of this\nDon Pianta fellow. {[0100|64000000]}I cannot WAIT\nto meet him!{b}
mac_2_011	It may sound easy, but he's a\nsyndicate boss, folks.{[0100|64000000]} The rumors\nabout him are scary.{b}{[0004]}And Don Pianta is a recluse.{[0100|fa000000]}\nJust getting an audience with\nhim will be difficult.{b}
mac_2_012	You want somethin', chump?{[0100|fa000000]} This is\nthe fortress of the Robbo Thieves.{[0100|64000000]}\nYou lost?{b}{[0004]}What business brings a chump like\nyou to a place like this?{[0100|64000000]} Say it\nain't vacation.{b}

mac_2_015	And you know that scumbag demands\nprotection money from us too, yeah?{b}{[0004]}You know all that and you STILL\nwant us to tell you how you can\nmeet that crumb?{b}
mac_2_016	What?{[0100|fa000000]} You gotta be kiddin' me.{[0100|64000000]}\nAm I hearin' you right?{[0100|64000000]} I coulda\nsworn you said...{b}{[0004]}You REALLY want me to tell you\nhow to meet Don Pianta.{[0100|90010000]} The scum\nof the earth.{b}

mac_2_038	OK, then clean those ears out and\nlisten here...{b}{[0004]}At the store next to the Pianta Parlor\nin the west part of town, buy a Dried\nMushroom, then a Dizzy Dial.{b}{[0004]}Make SURE you buy 'em in that\norder—Dried Mushroom, Dizzy Dial.{[0100|64000000]}\nYou got that?{b}{[0004]}Do that and the shopkeeper will\nask you what your favorite color is.{[0100|fa000000]}\nYou answer "yellow."{b}{[0004]}See, "yellow" is the password\nfor gettin' into Don Scumbag's\noh-so-comfy office.{b}{[0004]}You got all that?{[0101]}

mac_3_001_03_kur	It sure sounds like it!{[0100|fa000000]} That must\nbe why they need the legendary\ntreasure, huh?{b}
mac_3_001_03_nok	Yes, sir!{[0100|fa000000]} And we figure that would be\nwhy they need the ancient treasure.{b}
mac_3_001_03_win	Correct, dearie.{[0100|fa000000]} And that, you\nsee, is why they need that\nlegendary treasure...{b}
mac_3_001_03_yos	Uh-huh! {[0100|64000000]}You got THAT right!{[0100|fa000000]}\nThat's why those jerks need\nthat legendary treasure!{b}
mac_3_001_04	Hrmm...{[0100|64000000]} This doesn't bode well.{[0100|fa000000]} The\nsituation has gotten far more serious\nthan I thought!{b}
mac_3_001_05	Let me bring you up to speed.{[0100|fa000000]}\nI've been researching just what\nthis treasure could be...{b}{[0004]}One book I came across held to what\nI thought was a preposterous theory...{b}{[0004]}This book claimed that the\n"treasure" was, in actuality,\nthe great cataclysm.{b}{[0004]}The very cataclysm that, a\nthousand years ago, sank\nthat town underground!{b}
mac_3_001_06_kur	Wait a sec! {[0100|fa000000]}So they wanna use\nthat cataclysm's power to take\nover the world?!{b}
mac_3_001_06_nok	S-so those guys want to use the\npower of that...{[0100|64000000]}*gulp*...{[0100|64000000]}cataclysm\nto rule the world?{b}
mac_3_001_06_win	So these fiends plan to use the\npower of the cataclysm to control\nthe world?{b}
mac_3_001_06_yos	So these jerks think the power of\nthat cataclysm will help them rule\nthe world?!{b}
mac_3_001_07	I can't say for sure what they will\ndo or why, but we must consider\nthe possibility.{b}{[0004]}Now that things have come to this,\nwe mustn't let them near the\nlegendary treasure.{b}{[0004]}That's all that matters.{[0100|64000000]} Because if\nthey do get it, then once again,\nthis town...{b}{[0004]}No...{[0100|64000000]}the ENTIRE WORLD could\nbe destroyed!{b}
mac_3_001_07_kur	Oh my GOSH, Professor!{[0100|fa000000]} Then we\ngotta get the next Crystal Star\nright away!{b}
mac_3_001_07_nok	Um...{[0100|64000000]} In that case, Professor...{[0100|fa000000]} We\nneed to find that next Crystal Star!{[0100|32000000]}\nAnd FAST!{b}
mac_3_001_07_win	In that case, Frankly...{[0100|fa000000]}\nWe must procure that next\nCrystal Star, quickly!{b}
mac_3_001_07_yos	Then out with it, Prof!{[0100|fa000000]} We gotta find\nthat next Crystal Star, super quick!{b}
mac_3_002	Hrmm...{[0100|fa000000]} According to the map, it\nappears the next Crystal Star is\nin {color[e61b00cc]}Twilight Town{color[000000b2]}.{b}
mac_3_003_kur	Twilight Town?{b}
mac_3_003_nok	Twilight Town?{b}
mac_3_003_win	Twilight Town?{b}
mac_3_003_yos	Twilight Town?{b}
mac_3_004	To tell you the truth, I don't know\nmuch about the place myself.{[0100|fa000000]}\nOnly rumors.{b}{[0004]}I have heard that, as the name\nimplies, it's perpetually dim and\neerie there.{b}{[0004]}Wait just a moment...{b}
mac_3_005	AHA!{[0100|fa000000]} There appears to be a pipe\nto Twilight Town somewhere here\nin Rogueport.{b}{[0004]}I do believe it's somewhere\nunderneath the west part of\ntown.{[0100|fa000000]} Yes, definitely.{b}{[0004]}If you get stuck for any reason, just\ncome back and see me again, OK?{b}
mac_3_006_kur	Beneath the west part of\ntown!{[0100|64000000]} Gotcha! We're on it!{[0100|fa000000]}\nThanks, Professor.{b}{[0004]}Wooo! {[0100|fa000000]}All right, Mario!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's do it!{b}
mac_3_006_nok	The west part of town?{[0100|64000000]} Underground?{[0100|64000000]}\nOkey dokey!{[0100|fa000000]} Thank you, Professor!{b}{[0004]}Well, Mario...{[0100|fa000000]} I guess we should\nleave posthaste!{b}
mac_3_006_win	Below the western part of town?{[0100|64000000]}\nVery well, then!{[0100|fa000000]} Cheers, Frankly!{b}{[0004]}Come along now, Mario!{[0100|fa000000]} We go\nat once!{b}
mac_3_006_yos	Under the ground in the west part of\nthe town?{[0100|64000000]} Check!{[0100|fa000000]} Gotcha, Prof!{b}{[0004]}C'mon, Gonzales! {[0100|64000000]}Let's go!{[0100|fa000000]} Time to\nbreak out!{b}
mac_3_007_kur	Professor!{[0100|fa000000]} We found the pipe and\ntried to go through, but we got\npushed back out!{b}
mac_3_007_nok	Ummmmm...{[0100|64000000]} Hey, Professor?{[0100|fa000000]} We tried\ngoing into that pipe, but we got\nspat back out...{b}
mac_3_007_win	Frankly!{[0100|fa000000]} We went into that blasted\npipe, but something pushed us right\nback out!{b}
mac_3_007_yos	Hey, Prof!{[0100|fa000000]} The pipe's a no-go!{[0100|64000000]}\nWe went in, but we got pushed\nright back out!{b}
mac_3_008_kur	Professor!{[0100|fa000000]} We found the pipe that\nleads to Twilight Town...{b}{[0004]}But it totally didn't work!{[0100|64000000]} It just\npushes you right back out!{[0100|fa000000]} We can't\nget through.{b}
mac_3_008_nok	Umm, Professor...{[0100|fa000000]} We found the pipe\nto Twilight Town...{b}{[0004]}But I don't think it works.{[0100|64000000]} The thing\njust rejects us.{[0100|fa000000]} There's no way\nthrough it.{b}
mac_3_008_win	Frankly!{[0100|fa000000]} We found the pipe you said\nwould take us to Twilight Town...{b}{[0004]}But it doesn't work, darling.{[0100|64000000]} It just\npushed us back out.{[0100|fa000000]} Can't you do\nsomething?{b}
mac_3_008_yos	Yo, Prof!{[0100|fa000000]} We found your pipe, and\nthat thing's all stopped up!{b}{[0004]}We tried and tried, but we can't break\nthrough it!{[0100|fa000000]} Got any drain cleaner?{b}
mac_3_009	What?{[0100|fa000000]} You can't get through the\npipe, you say? {[0100|64000000]}How odd...{b}{[0004]}Hrmm...{[0100|fa000000]} I'm afraid I haven't the\nfoggiest idea of what you should do.{b}
mac_3_010	Oh!{[0100|fa000000]} Of course!{b}{[0004]}I've heard that a fellow from Twilight\nTown lives here in Rogueport.{b}{[0004]}If anybody knows how to get through\nthe pipe, it'll be him.{b}{[0004]}His name was, uh...{[0100|fa000000]} Dang.{[0100|fa000000]}\nWhat was it?{b}{[0004]}Ah, yes! {[0100|64000000]}The lover of dark\nplaces!{[0100|fa000000]} {color[e61b00cc]}DARKLY{color[000000b2]}!{b}{[0004]}I've seen him loitering right here\nin this part of town in the past.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLook for Darkly!{b}
mac_3_011	Hi there! {[0100|64000000]}The name's Darkly.{[0100|fa000000]}\nI'm from Twilight Town.{[0100|fa000000]} Do you\nguys need something?{b}
mac_3_012	Huh?{[0100|fa000000]} You can't get through the pipe\nto Twilight Town?{b}
mac_3_013	Well shucks, it's usually no sweat!{[0100|fa000000]}\nYou just need to have something\nthat has your name written on it.{b}{[0004]}Don't you have anything{[0100|fa000000]} that has\nyour name written on it? {[0100|fa000000]}C'mon,\neveryone does!{b}
mac_3_014	No?{[0100|fa000000]} Really?{[0100|fa000000]} OK. Hang on.{[0100|fa000000]} I'll write it\nfor you.{[0100|fa000000]} What's your name?{b}
mac_3_015	Mario, huh?{[0100|fa000000]} OK... {[0100|64000000]}I'll write it here\non the seat of your overalls.{[0100|fa000000]}\nM-A-R-I-O, right?{b}
mac_3_016	There!{[0100|64000000]} Perfect-a-mundo!{[0100|fa000000]} While I'm at\nit, I'll write your partner's name too.{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}What's your name?{b}
mac_3_017_kur	Goombella!{b}
mac_3_017_nok	Um... {[0100|fa000000]}K-Koops.{b}
mac_3_017_win	Depends on who's asking!{[0100|64000000]} For you,\nI am Flurrie.{b}
mac_3_017_yos	{[030b]}, baby!{b}
mac_3_018_kur	{[030a|01000000]}Tee hee!{[0100|fa000000]} That TICKLES!{b}
mac_3_018_nok	{[030a|01000000]}H-hey!{[0100|fa000000]} Think you could ease up on\njabbing me, Pokey?{b}
mac_3_018_win	{[030a|01000000]}Mmmm...{[0100|fa000000]} A bit to the left...{b}
mac_3_018_yos	{[030a|01000000]}Hey!{[0100|fa000000]} Watch where you're\ndrawing, buddy!{b}
mac_3_019	I don't know what errand is taking\nyou to Twilight Town, but I hope it\ngoes well.{b}{[0004]}I'll be rooting for you!{b}
mac_4_000	That look...{[0100|fa000000]} You must have found the\nnext Crystal Star!{[0100|fa000000]} I've been busy too,\nconfirming some...stunning things...{b}{[0004]}Before we speak though,{[0100|fa000000]} take the\nCrystal Star to the Thousand-Year\nDoor, OK?{b}
mac_4_001_01	{[0307|00004040]}{[0309|01000000]}\nWhuh-whuh-{[0100|96000000]}WHAAAAAAT?!{b}
mac_4_001_02	{[0307|00004040]}Th-that was written in Princess\nPeach's email?{[0307|0000803f]}{b}{[0004]}The legendary treasure is actually\nthe spirit of an ancient demon...{b}{[0004]}And those fiends want to use the\nCrystal Stars to open the Thousand-\nYear Door and resurrect it?{b}{[0004]}{[0100|fa000000]}How bone-chilling...{[0100|fa000000]} Sadly, it DOES\nseem to be consistent with what\nI've uncovered...{b}
mac_4_001_03_kur	Don't leave us in suspense!{[0100|fa000000]} Give us\nthe scoop, Professor!{b}
mac_4_001_03_nok	Ummm... {[0100|64000000]}Well, will you tell us or what,\nProfessor Frankly?{b}
mac_4_001_03_win	Pray tell, what information have you\nuncovered, Frankly?{b}
mac_4_001_03_yos	Well, c'mon, give it up, Prof!{[0100|fa000000]} What did\nyou find out?!{b}
mac_4_001_03_viv	What have you found out, Professor?{b}
mac_4_001_03_chu	Well, we're waiting, Professor.{[0100|64000000]}\nWhat did you find out?{b}
mac_4_001_04	Hrmm...{[0100|fa000000]} This is rather long, so you'd\nbest listen well.{b}
mac_4_001_05	{[0307|00004040]}Are all of you ready?{[0100|fa000000]} And you\nthere!{[0100|fa000000]} In front of the screen!{[0100|fa000000]}\nYou listen up too!{b}
mac_4_001_06_kur	Screen?{[0100|64000000]} What screen?!{[0100|fa000000]} What in the\nworld are you talking about?{b}
mac_4_001_06_nok	Ummm... {[0100|64000000]}Who are you talking to, sir?{b}
mac_4_001_06_win	Pardon?{[0100|64000000]} What screen? {[0100|fa000000]}If I may speak\nfrankly, Frankly, you're speaking\nutter nonsense!{b}
mac_4_001_06_yos	Did someone piledrive your head or\nwhat? {[0100|64000000]}I don't see any screen here,\nProfessor Poindexter!{b}
mac_4_001_06_viv	Maybe I'm missing something...{[0100|64000000]} Are you\ntalking to no one?{b}
mac_4_001_06_chu	You strange, strange man.{[0100|fa000000]} What did\nTHAT mean?{b}
mac_4_001_07	{[0307|00004040]}OH, NEVER YOU MIND!{[0307|0000803f]}{[0100|fa000000]} Don't worry\nabout such trivial details.{[0100|64000000]} Just listen!{b}
mac_4_001_08	The "great cataclysm" that destroyed\nthe city which once stood here may\nwell refer to this demon...{b}{[0004]}It's said that the seven Crystal\nStars were actually CREATED by\nthat monster...{b}{[0004]}AND that this thing used the power\nof the Crystal Stars to try to control\nthe world...{b}
mac_4_001_09	According to legend, the demon was\ndefeated in the end by four heroes.{b}{[0004]}But only the beast's physical form\nwas destroyed...{[0100|fa000000]} Its spirit could not\nbe eradicated.{b}{[0004]}So, the heroes used the Crystal\nStars, which they had stolen from\nthe demon...{b}{[0004]}and they sealed its wicked spirit\nwithin the Palace of Shadow, locked\nbehind the Thousand-Year Door.{b}{[0004]}From this, I gather the Crystal Stars\ncannot distinguish good from evil.{b}{[0004]}So, if they're all united, they\ncould either seal away or\nresurrect the demon.{b}{[0004]}It seems that who wields the\nCrystal Stars determines if\nthey're used for evil or good.{b}
mac_4_001_10_kur	Then the question is whether\ngathering the Crystal Stars is\na danger in and of itself...{b}{[0004]}Don't you think maybe it'd be better\nto break them apart and scatter\nthe pieces?{b}
mac_4_001_10_nok	Ummm... {[0100|64000000]}Doesn't that mean that\nmaybe gathering the Crystal Stars\nis dangerous?{b}{[0004]}Ummm... {[0100|64000000]}I dunno, maybe we oughta\njust shatter those things.{b}
mac_4_001_10_win	Well, we must consider the idea that\ngathering the Crystal Stars is unwise.{b}{[0004]}Forgive me for saying so, but shouldn't\nwe consider destroying them?{b}
mac_4_001_10_yos	Hey, then isn't it possible that we\nshouldn't gather these Crystal Stars?{b}{[0004]}Maybe we oughta just stomp the\nheck out of 'em and throw the\npieces away!{b}
mac_4_001_10_viv	I guess we ought to consider not\ncollecting the Crystal Stars, then...{b}{[0004]}Does anyone think it might just\nbe better to destroy them once\nand for all? {b}
mac_4_001_10_chu	Well, the way I see it, it may be\nentirely the wrong idea to collect\nthese things.{b}{[0004]}I feel as though the best course\nof action might be to destroy\nthem utterly.{b}
mac_4_001_11	That was my first thought too,\nbut further research suggests\nwe can't do that.{b}{[0004]}There's a slight possibility that the\nThousand-Year Door{[0100|96000000]} is weakening.{b}{[0004]}It seems the Crystal Stars hold\nthe power to seal the beast for\na thousand years.{b}{[0004]}So once a thousand years pass,\nthe power to keep the door sealed\nshut will fail.{b}{[0004]}And unfortunately, this year may be\nthe thousandth year.{b}{[0004]}In other words, we must be ready\nfor the demon's return, even if the\nX-Nauts fail.{b}
mac_4_001_12_kur	In that case, to seal the demon,\nwe gotta go collect the rest of\nthe Crystal Stars immediately!{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}No time to lose! {[0100|64000000]}Where can we find\nthe next one?{b}
mac_4_001_12_nok	Well... {[0100|64000000]}Sheesh, to seal the demon,\nwe'd better go get the rest of those\nCrystal Stars then!{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}Where can we find the next one,\nProfessor Frankly?{b}
mac_4_001_12_win	Well, what are we dallying for?\nIn order to seal the demon, {[0100|64000000]}we must\nfind the rest of the Crystal Stars!{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}Where to next, Frankly?{b}
mac_4_001_12_yos	Whoa! {[0100|64000000]}Let's roll, then!{[0100|64000000]} To seal the\ndemon, we gotta get the rest of\nthose Crystal Stars!{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}Where's the next one at?{b}
mac_4_001_12_viv	Oh.{[0100|fa000000]} Then I guess we'd better find the\nrest of the Crystal Stars if we want to\nseal that demon, huh?{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}Where do we start?{b}
mac_4_001_12_chu	Oh my!{[0100|64000000]} I suppose we'd better shake\nour tails and find the other Crystal\nStars if we want to seal that demon!{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}Tell me, Professor, where is the next\none located?{b}
mac_4_002	Hrmm...{[0100|fa000000]} According to the map,\nit appears to be somewhere on\nKeelhaul Key.{b}
mac_4_002_kur	Keelhaul Key?{b}
mac_4_002_nok	Keelhaul Key?{b}
mac_4_002_win	Keelhaul Key?{b}
mac_4_002_yos	Keelhaul Key?{b}
mac_4_002_viv	Keelhaul Key?{b}
mac_4_002_chu	Keelhaul Key?{b}
mac_4_003	I'm none too familiar with the\nplace, but I've heard countless\nunsavory rumors.{b}{[0004]}You know, the usual stuff...{[0100|fa000000]}\nVengeful spirits full of hatred,\nevil curses, things like that...{b}{[0004]}{[0100|64000000]}I'm sure the sea salts down by the\nharbor know more.{[0100|fa000000]} You should head\nthere first.{b}
mac_4_049	What do you blokes want?{b}
mac_4_049_01	I have no interest in passing the time\nwith you, so leave me be!{b}
mac_4_050	You seek Admiral Bobbery?{b}{[0004]}Never heard of the gent.{[0100|fa000000]} Take your\nsearch elsewhere.{b}
mac_4_051	Admiral Bobbery?{b}{[0004]}I haven't the faintest idea\nwhat you're talking about.{[0100|fa000000]}\nNow, if you please...{b}
mac_4_052_kur	Don't play dumb with us!{[0100|fa000000]}\nWe were already told that\nYOU are Admiral Bobbery!{b}
mac_4_052_nok	Ummm... {[0100|64000000]}Listen, Mr. Bobbery...{[0100|fa000000]}\nWe already heard that you're\nthe Bobbery we're looking for.{b}
mac_4_052_win	Oh, drop this SHAM, sir!{[0100|fa000000]} We're already\nquite aware that you're Bobbery!{b}
mac_4_052_yos	Drop the act, Super 'Stache!{[0100|fa000000]}\nWe already found out that\nyou're Admiral Bobbery!{b}
mac_4_052_viv	Please, don't insult us...{[0100|fa000000]}\nWe already know you're the\nadmiral, so just admit it!{b}
mac_4_052_chu	Don't be so coy, Admiral!{[0100|fa000000]} We've\nalready found out your identity!{b}
mac_4_053	Harrumph! {[0100|64000000]}What poppycock...{[0100|fa000000]} Tell me,\nwhat would you want with me if I were\nthis chap?{b}
mac_4_054	You say your ship needs a\nnavigator, and you want me\nto do the job, mmm?{b}{[0004]}So sorry, but you'll have to look\nelsewhere.{[0100|fa000000]} I shall set sail upon\nthe sea...{[0100|64000000]}nevermore!{b}
mac_4_055_kur	But...{[0100|fa000000]} Look, we're begging you here!{[0100|64000000]}\nYou totally have to!{b}{[0004]}You're the only one who can guide\nour ship to Keelhaul Key! {[0100|64000000]}This is\nserious stuff!{b}
mac_4_055_nok	But...{[0100|64000000]} But...{[0100|64000000]} But...{[0100|64000000]} But...{[0100|fa000000]} Please,\nAdmiral, sir!{[0100|fa000000]} We NEED you!{b}{[0004]}Nobody else can get us to\nKeelhaul Key!{b}
mac_4_055_win	But...{[0100|fa000000]} Show some compassion, dear\nman. {[0100|64000000]}Don't make us beg!{[0100|64000000]} We simply\nmust have you!{b}{[0004]}You are our sole hope for reaching\nKeelhaul Key!{b}
mac_4_055_yos	But... {[0100|64000000]}That's just not cool!{[0100|fa000000]} You wanna\nsee me beg or something?{[0100|64000000]} Is that it?{b}{[0004]}You HAVE to come along!{[0100|fa000000]} Only you\ncan get us safely to Keelhaul Key!{b}
mac_4_055_viv	But...{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe you don't understand\nhow important this is.{[0100|fa000000]} We NEED you.{b}{[0004]}Without you, we'll never get to\nKeelhaul Key!{b}
mac_4_055_chu	But...{[0100|fa000000]} Don't be like that!{[0100|64000000]} We truly\nneed your help, can't you see that?{b}{[0004]}Without you, we'll surely meet our\nends on the way to Keelhaul Key!{b}
mac_4_056	Awfully sorry, dear fellows, but when\nI say "no," what I mean is...{[0100|fa000000]}NO!{b}
mac_4_056_01	Now, away with you!{b}
mac_4_057	I shall set sail upon the sea\nnevermore.{[0100|fa000000]} Away with you!{b}
mac_4_058_kur	Darn!{[0100|64000000]} What do we do, Mario?{[0100|fa000000]}\nThat guy doesn't seem too stoked\nto come with us.{b}
mac_4_058_nok	Um... {[0100|64000000]}What's next, Mario?{[0100|fa000000]} I don't\nthink we're gonna convince that\nguy to join us.{b}
mac_4_058_win	I'm at a loss, Mario...{[0100|fa000000]} This gentleman\nis stubborn as an ornery old mule!{b}
mac_4_058_yos	What's the next move, chief?{[0100|fa000000]} This\nsalty dude is going nowhere fast.{b}
mac_4_058_viv	What do you think, Mario?{[0100|fa000000]}\nNothing we say seems to be\nenough to convince this man...{b}
mac_4_058_chu	Mmmm... {[0100|64000000]}Your thoughts, Mario?{[0100|fa000000]}\nWe don't seem to be getting\nanywhere with this man.{b}
mac_4_059_kur	Know what I wonder though?{[0100|fa000000]}\nWhy's he all weirded out about\nthe sea, anyway?{b}{[0004]}We oughta find someone who knows\nthis guy and find out what his\nmalfunction is.{b}
mac_4_059_nok	He seems pretty burned out...{[0100|fa000000]}\nWhy is he so hung up on not\nsailing again, I wonder?{b}{[0004]}Maybe we should ask around and see\nif anybody knows the admiral's story.{b}
mac_4_059_win	But... {[0100|64000000]}I can't help but wonder...{[0100|fa000000]}\nWhat is it that turned this poor\nman against the sea?{b}{[0004]}Perhaps it would behoove us to\nsearch out someone who knows\nhim and ask about it.{b}
mac_4_059_yos	I can't figure this guy out!{[0100|fa000000]} What's his\nbeef with the ocean, anyway?{b}{[0004]}Know what we oughta do?{[0100|fa000000]} Go find\nsomeone who knows what this\ndude's deal is!{b}
mac_4_059_viv	But... {[0100|64000000]}Don't you find it odd?{[0100|fa000000]}\nWhy would a sailor have such\nhatred for the sea?{b}{[0004]}We need answers... {[0100|64000000]}Maybe we\nshould ask around town about\nthis man's story...{b}
mac_4_059_chu	I can't help but wonder...{[0100|fa000000]} What could\nturn such a man against the sea?{b}{[0004]}I think our only option is to ask\naround and see if anyone knows\nhis tale.{b}
mac_4_060	Admiral Bobbery won't go to sea?{[0100|fa000000]}\nThat's a setback.{b}{[0004]}Hrmm...{[0100|fa000000]} I don't know the man myself,\nso I don't know what to tell you,\nunfortunately.{b}{[0004]}But I'd be willing to bet that Podley\nknows a thing or two.{b}
mac_4_077	What?!{[0100|fa000000]} Oh, by Blabberton's beard!{[0100|64000000]}\nNot you again!{b}{[0004]}No matter how many times you\nentreat me, my stance is firm!{[0100|fa000000]}\nNow away with you!{b}

mac_4_082	"Time, like love, is a tide.{[0100|64000000]}\nYou are one with the sea...{[0100|64000000]}\nas you were one with me..."{b}{[0004]}A...{[0100|fa000000]} A thousand pardons...{[0100|fa000000]} But may I\nhave a moment{[0100|64000000]} alone, if you please?{b}
mac_4_083	Yes, love...{[0100|fa000000]} I WAS happy...{[0100|fa000000]} My sweet,\nsweet Scarlette...{[0100|f4010000]} I love you still.{b}
mac_4_084	Now then! {[0100|fa000000]}You were looking for\na navigator, I believe?{[0100|fa000000]} Bound for\nKeelhaul Key?{b}
mac_4_085	Harrumph!{[0100|fa000000]} If you think an old sea\nbomb like me is what you need,\nthen let's shove off!{b}
mac_4_086_kur	Admiral Bobbery!{[0100|64000000]} Awesome!{b}

mac_5_006_nok	Um...{[0100|64000000]} But I thought only super-rich\npeople can get tickets on that train...{b}
mac_5_006_win	Not to be a wet blanket, but isn't\nthat line reserved for fabulously\nwealthy individuals?{b}
mac_5_006_yos	Hey, I heard you had to be\ndisgustingly rich to get a\nticket for that train!{b}
mac_5_006_viv	Will they let us on board?{[0100|fa000000]} I heard\nyou have to be super-duper rich\nto get a seat.{b}
mac_5_006_bom	Pardon me for saying so, but mustn't\nyou have a treasury full of riches to\nride that train?{b}

msg_kuri_npc_147	{[010a]}That's Bowser.{[0110]}{[0100|2c010000]}\x0f\x01\x10 He came to the\nPalace of Shadow for Peach and\nthat treasure.{b}{[0004]}You gotta give him credit for\ncoming this far, really.{[0100|2c010000]} I almost\nrespect him, actually.{b}{[0004]}But no time for all that!{[0100|2c010000]} We have to go\nafter Grodus and Peach! {[0100|fa000000]}C'mon!{b}
msg_kuri_npc_148	{[010a]}That's Kammy Koopa.{[0110]}{[0100|2c010000]}\x0f\x01\x10 She's the old\nwitch that serves as Bowser's advisor.{b}{[0004]}But what do you care?{[0100|2c010000]} Let's\nstop worrying about her and\ngo save Peach!{b}

hint_party.msbt
party_hint_None	You can't get a hint right now!
Hint_Global_01	Let's head to the Thousand-Year\nDoor on sublevel three so we can hold\nthe Crystal Star up in front of it!
Hint_Global_04	Let's hold the Crystal Star in front of\nthe Thousand-Year Door! {[0100|fa000000]}I'm sure you\nremember, but it's below Rogueport.
Hint_Global_05	Let's hold the Crystal Star up in front\nof the Thousand-Year Door!
Hint_Global_06	Let's head back to Rogueport.
Hint_STG0_02	Let's look for Professor Frankly!{[0100|fa000000]} I know\nhe lives somewhere in town...
Hint_STG0_03	The professor is waiting for us outside.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's go!
Hint_STG0_31	Let's use the pipe in front of the\nprofessor's house to get down\nunderneath the town.
Hint_STG0_04	Wherever the Thousand-Year Door is,\nit sure is hidden well...{[0100|fa000000]} Let's go back\nand search the areas underground.
Hint_STG0_27	That Thousand-Year Door must be\nnearby.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's keep moving forward.
Hint_STG0_28	I don't think we can get through\nthis debris.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's go back the way\nwe came.
Hint_STG0_06	The floor is moving!{[0100|fa000000]} How are we\nsupposed to get to that pipe ahead\nof here?
Hint_STG0_07	You think anything happens if you hit\none of those blocks with a hammer?
Hint_STG0_10	There's a switch here.{[0100|fa000000]} You wanna hit\nit or stomp on it or something?
Hint_STG0_12	That black treasure-chest thing is so\nmysterious...{[0100|fa000000]} Can we check it out?
Hint_STG0_13	I wonder where the key is for the\nblack chest.{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe it's closer than\nwe think.
Hint_STG0_41	There's no key in this room.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's look someplace else.
Hint_STG0_37	We found the key the black chest\nwas talking about!
Hint_STG0_14	The Black Key we found must open\nsomething down here...{[0100|fa000000]} Let's just\nmove on for now.
Hint_STG0_15	Looks like there's nothing else here.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's keep going.
Hint_STG0_17	Didn't you just learn how to be an\nairplane? You might be able to\nuse that.
Hint_STG0_40	Let's go take another look at the\nThousand-Year Door.{[0100|fa000000]} It was on\nsublevel three.
Hint_STG0_19	So that's the Thousand-Year Door!{[0100|fa000000]}\nThere's probably a place where you're\nsupposed to hold the map up...
Hint_STG0_20	I think we could hold up the Magical\nMap on that pedestal in front of the\ndoor, don't you think?
Hint_STG0_33	Let's head back beneath Rogueport.{[0100|fa000000]}\nThere should be a pipe underground\nthat connects with Petal Meadows.
Hint_STG0_21	There should be a pipe somewhere\nunderground that can take us to\nPetal Meadows.
Hint_STG0_22	Maybe you need to turn into a plane\nto find the pipe that connects with\nPetal Meadows?
Hint_STG0_29	I dunno—I have this feeling that the\npipe to Petal Meadows isn't this way.
Hint_STG0_25	Ew, did that thing move?{[0004]}You could test it by jumping on it,\nbut it's kind of slimy and gross, so\nmaybe just use your hammer?
Hint_STG1_Out_Area_00	Let's return to Petal Meadows to find\nthat Crystal Star.
Hint_STG1_00_00	All right, let's go find that\nCrystal Star!
Hint_STG1_00_08	Sometimes everything looks ordinary,\nthen you hit something with your\nhammer and make a discovery.
Hint_STG1_00_03	Let's talk to the mayor of Petalburg\nto see what he knows.{[0100|fa000000]} He lives in a\npink house!
Hint_STG1_00_04	Let's head to Shhwonk Fortress, past\nPetalburg.{[0100|fa000000]} I guess we just follow the\nroad here...
Hint_STG1_00_05	Let's head to Shhwonk Fortress!{[0100|fa000000]}\nI guess we just follow this path?
Hint_STG1_00_06	Where could the Sun Stone and\nMoon Stone be?{[0100|fa000000]} Eh, let's move on\nfor now.
Hint_STG1_00_07_01	We'll get through this somehow!{[0100|fa000000]}\nIf there's something you want to\ninvestigate, let me help!
Hint_STG1_00_07_02	Why not try hitting that statue or\nwhatever it is with your hammer?
Hint_STG1_00_07_03	You think there's an item we can use\nto defeat the enemies here? Maybe\nsomething that shakes the ground?
Hint_STG1_00_09	This room looks just like the last one.\nSo we can give these pedestals the\nsame treatment.
Hint_STG1_00_34	What a strange statue...
Hint_STG1_00_49	We probably can't move ahead unless\nwe deal with the strange statue deep\nin the fortress.
Hint_STG1_00_13	Let's try going into the pipe that\npopped out of the bottom of that\nweird statue and explore more!
Hint_STG1_00_16_sun	We still don't know where the Sun\nStone is, but let's move on for now.
Hint_STG1_00_16_moon	We still don't know where the Moon\nStone is, but let's move on for now.
Hint_STG1_00_17	If we use the stones that we found,\nwe should be able to get to Hooktail\nCastle through a secret pipe.{[0004]}Hey, didn't we see sun and moon\nshapes near the area where we\nfirst saw Hooktail?
Hint_STG1_00_19_nok	I think we should let Koops join us.{[0100|fa000000]}\nWe're not gonna keep him waiting\noutside of Petalburg forever, right?
Hint_STG1_00_18	I wonder if there are any clues around\nhere related to the secret pipe?{[0004]}We already have the Sun Stone and\nMoon Stone, so if there's some place\nwe can use them, we're set.
Hint_STG1_00_19	Huh. These switches are kinda funny.{[0100|fa000000]}\nMaybe I can help you trigger them\nboth at once?{[0004]}If you hold {color[4762c0ff]}{color[000000b2]}, I'll stay put so you can\nmove around...uh, until you're ready\nto let go, that is.
Hint_STG1_00_25	That place where we used the Sun\nand Moon Stones seemed a little off.{[0100|fa000000]}\nWanna go take another look?
Hint_STG1_00_21	Let's use the secret pipe and go to\nHooktail Castle!
Hint_STG1_00_52	Hooktail Castle is coming up...\nMario, are you ready?
Hint_STG1_00_22	Let's head back to Hooktail Castle.
Hint_STG1_00_23	It sounds like Hooktail has the\nCrystal Star.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's keep moving.
Hint_STG1_00_24	Let's find a way to get past the\nbroken bridge.{[0100|fa000000]} Sometimes you gotta\ngo back when you can't go forward.
Hint_STG1_00_33	We gotta find a way to get past that\nbroken bridge.{[0100|fa000000]} Think we can go over\nit somehow?
Hint_STG1_00_32	How are we supposed to move with\nall these guys in the way? {[0100|fa000000]}Can you\nhammer 'em out of the way, Mario?
Hint_Global_00_nok	Y-you wanna try using my ability if\nyou're in trouble?
Hint_STG1_00_45	Maybe try using my ability when\nyou're in trouble?{[0004]}If you hold {color[4762c0ff]}{color[000000b2]}, I'll stay put.{[0100|fa000000]} Then you\ncan move around and do other stuff\nuntil you're ready to let go.
Hint_STG1_00_43	This seems weirdly familiar, but...{[0100|fa000000]}\nI guess we should find this Black Key?
Hint_STG1_00_25_kur	Mario, we're running out of time!{[0100|64000000]}\nWe need to escape this room fast!
Hint_STG1_00_26	There's a black chest.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's check\nit out.
Hint_STG1_00_42	What do you think, Mario?{[0100|fa000000]} Should we\nopen the black chest with that key\nwe found?
Hint_STG1_00_27	You can pass through narrow spaces\nif you turn sideways with .{[0100|fa000000]} I'll bet\nthere's a place you can use that.
Hint_STG1_00_46	This room sure has a lot of windows...{[0100|fa000000]}\nThink they're all the same, or is one\ndifferent from the others?
Hint_STG1_00_50	Think there's anything interesting in\nthis room?
Hint_STG1_00_28	Let's find a pipe that connects with\nBoggly Woods.{[0100|fa000000]} There's probably one\nunderneath Rogueport.
Hint_STG1_00_38	Have you ever seen one of the little\ncreatures from Boggly Woods?{[0100|fa000000]} I hear\nthey visit this town sometimes.
Hint_STG1_00_51	I have this hunch that the pipe\nto Boggly Woods isn't on this side\nof town.
Hint_STG1_00_29	Wasn't that one of the creatures the\nprofessor mentioned? {[0100|fa000000]}I wonder if\nthere's some way to follow it...
Hint_STG1_00_48	Let's get back to sublevel three\nand try to follow that strange\nlittle creature!
Hint_STG1_00_41	Let's try to talk with that creature\nfrom Boggly Woods.{[0100|fa000000]} It must know how\nto get there...{[0100|64000000]}and might let us follow!
Hint_STG1_00_39	Let's talk to Punio and follow him to\nBoggly Woods.{[0100|fa000000]} He's waiting for us on\nsublevel three!
Hint_STG1_00_30	Let's go see Punio.{[0100|fa000000]} He can probably\nhelp us get to Boggly Woods.
Hint_STG1_00_40	Let's head back to the pipe that\nconnects with Boggly Woods.{[0100|fa000000]} It was\nin Rogueport on sublevel three.
Hint_STG1_00_31	Let's go through that pipe Punio\ntold us about that connects with\nBoggly Woods.
Hint_STG2_23	We should probably head back to\nBoggly Woods...
Hint_STG2_01	The Crystal Star is somewhere in the\nGreat Tree.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's keep going along\nthis road.
Hint_STG2_42	Punio went ahead to the Great Tree.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's meet him there.
Hint_STG2_01_00	How do we get inside this giant tree?{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's ask Punio.
Hint_STG2_43	Punio is waiting for us a little way\nup the Great Tree.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's talk to him.
Hint_STG2_02	Let's look for Flurrie's house.{[0100|fa000000]} It's deep\nin the woods.
Hint_STG2_24	Sometimes there are paths hiding in\nplain sight, like close to a wall!{[0100|fa000000]} Pretty\nsneaky, huh?
Hint_STG2_100	The pipe extended itself.{[0100|fa000000]} Think you\ncould glide across to that ledge as\na plane?
Hint_STG2_79	Even when it looks like there's no way\nforward, there might be a path if you\nlook hard.{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe a narrow passage?
Hint_STG2_02_00	Could Flurrie really not be here?{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's go farther in.
Hint_STG2_55	We still haven't met Flurrie.{[0100|fa000000]} Are you\nsure we don't need to go back to\nher house?
Hint_STG2_03	I feel like we saw Flurrie's necklace\nsomewhere, right?{[0100|fa000000]} Wasn't it right\nafter we got to the forest?
Hint_STG2_04_00	The Three Shadows dropped the\nnecklace we need before they ran\noff!{[0100|fa000000]} We're gonna grab it, right?
Hint_STG2_04	Let's deliver the necklace to Flurrie.
Hint_STG2_05	Let's go back to the Great Tree and\nfind the secret entrance.
Hint_STG2_25	The secret entrance is higher up on\nthe Great Tree, yes?{[0100|fa000000]} Then I shall\nuncover it for you with a press of {color[4762c0ff]}{color[000000b2]}.
Hint_STG2_56	Punio opened the door for us.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's go\ninside the Great Tree.
Hint_STG2_70	Shouldn't we head back to the Great\nTree and find the Crystal Star?
Hint_STG2_26	The Crystal Star should be somewhere\nin the Great Tree.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's keep looking.
Hint_STG2_06_00	Where were the Punies taken?{[0100|fa000000]}\nI guess we just have to keep\nexploring the tree.
Hint_STG2_20	We need the cell keys in order to\nrescue the Punies.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's find 'em!
Hint_STG2_07_00	We got the Red Key.{[0100|fa000000]} I guess we can\nopen one of the cells with this?
Hint_STG2_07_01	Let's pick up that cell key the\nX-Naut dropped.
Hint_STG2_21	I wonder where the elder is...{[0100|fa000000]} Want\nto go check where Puniper and the\nothers were?
Hint_STG2_08	We need the Blue Key in order to\nsave Petuni and the others.{[0100|fa000000]} It wasn't\nup top, so maybe it's below?
Hint_STG2_27	If you place the Puni Orb on the\npedestal, the Punies gather there.{[0100|fa000000]}\nWhat's that number next to it?
Hint_STG2_28	The poor little Punies are too small to\nget over the gaps to that platform.{[0004]}If only they were in bubbles...{[0100|fa000000]} Then I\ncould simply blow them over!
Hint_STG2_17	Let's go after the Jabbi that has\nthe Blue Key!{[0100|fa000000]} It's toward the right\non sublevel two!
Hint_STG2_29	Let's help the Punies.{[0100|fa000000]} I'll bet we\ncould help in the battle if we could\nmake the Jabbies dizzy somehow!
Hint_STG2_38	We'll need everyone on board to\nbeat the Jabbies. {[0100|fa000000]}Are we missing\nany of the Punies?
Hint_STG2_30	I wonder where the Blue Key is.{[0100|fa000000]}\nMaybe head in the direction the\nJabbi came from?
Hint_STG2_08_00	We got the Blue Key!{[0100|fa000000]} Now we can\nrescue Petuni and the others.
Hint_STG2_22	With the Punies helping us, we'll find\nthat Crystal Star in no time!{[0100|fa000000]} I think\nit's at the very bottom of this tree...
Hint_STG2_33	This looks like a dead end. Maybe\nput the Puni Orb on the pedestal\nand see what happens?
Hint_STG2_34	Mario, do you have an ability that\ncan get us out of here?
Hint_STG2_74	We need to find a way to rescue all\nthe Punies!
Hint_STG2_60	Didn't we see pillars with patterns on\nthem somewhere?{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe on sublevel\ntwo, where the Jabbies were?
Hint_STG2_36	I think I remember the pictures on\nthe black pillars.{[0100|fa000000]} There was a sun...
Hint_STG2_75	That's a big treasure chest.{[0100|fa000000]} Seems like\nthere should be something AMAZING\nin there.
Hint_STG2_37	There's a panel on the floor you can\nbreak here.{[0100|fa000000]} Wanna use your new\nability, Mario?
Hint_STG2_09	If we act now, we might be able to\nrescue all the Punies!
Hint_STG2_80	We might be able to rescue the\nPunies by dropping them into\nthe hole!{[0100|fa000000]} Don't you agree?
Hint_STG2_53	So there's a hole here as well!{[0100|fa000000]}\nDoes that mean it's my turn in\nthe spotlight yet again?
Hint_STG2_39	Hey, uh, just as a reminder...{[0100|64000000]}you can\nmove around while you're holding me\nin place.{[0100|fa000000]} Y'know, in case that helps.
Hint_STG2_40	There's a pedestal. Let's try putting\nthe Puni Orb there.{[0100|fa000000]} By the way, do\nyou have all the Punies here?
Hint_STG2_11	Let's get out of here right away!{[0100|fa000000]}\nThere should be an exit if we go to\nthe first level.
Hint_STG2_54	There must be a way to meet Don\nPianta.{[0100|fa000000]} You want to try getting\ninformation on the west side?
Hint_STG2_13_00	We can't move on to the west side\nwithout a replacement contact lens.{[0100|fa000000]}\nMaybe they sell them at the store?
Hint_STG2_13_01	Let's go take a walk while we wait for\nour contact-lens order.
Hint_STG2_13_03	Looks like they got a contact lens\nin stock at the Rogueport shop.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's go buy it!
Hint_STG2_13_02	Let's give the contact lens to that\nperson who's blocking the path to\nthe west side.
Hint_STG9_00	Adventuring is hard.{[0100|fa000000]} Sometimes you\nneed to take a break and relax...{[0100|64000000]}and\nmaybe even play a few games!
Hint_STG2_91	Let's go talk to Ishnail in the east\nside of town.{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe someone can\ntell us exactly where he is...
Hint_STG2_12	We can't find out how to talk to\nDon Pianta unless we give 64 coins\nto Ishnail!
Hint_STG2_00	Ishnail told us the way to meet\nDon Pianta!{[0100|fa000000]} What was it again?{[0004]}We should go to the store next to\nPianta Parlor in the west side and buy\na Dried Mushroom then a Dizzy Dial.{[0004]}Then the shopkeeper will ask you\nyour favorite color, and you need\nto answer "yellow"...right?
Hint_STG2_06	Were you able to buy those two things\njust like Ishnail told us?{[0004]}Maybe we're forgetting something...{[0100|fa000000]}\nIt might help to step back outside\nand clear our heads.
Hint_STG2_48	That shop on the west side has a rear\nentrance!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's go see Don Pianta to\nget that Blimp Ticket to Glitzville.
Hint_STG2_15	Let's look for Frankie and Francesca.{[0100|fa000000]}\nIf they're going far, maybe they're\nwaiting for a ship at the port.
Hint_STG2_19	We found Frankie and Francesca...{[0100|fa000000]}\nMaybe we should check in with Don\nPianta one more time.
Hint_STG2_90	Don Pianta is being oddly sweet right\nnow.{[0100|fa000000]} Quick!{[0100|64000000]} Ask him for a Blimp Ticket!
Hint_STG2_16	Glitzville, here we come...{[0100|64000000]}after we find\nwhere to board the blimp.{[0100|fa000000]} Have we\nchecked every area in the west side?
Hint_STG2_44	Let's head to Glitzville!{[0100|fa000000]} The boarding\narea for the blimp is somewhere deep\ninto the western side of town.
Hint_STG3_00	We should get back to Glitzville!{[0100|fa000000]}\nThat's where the action is, right?
Hint_STG3_01	Where do you think the Crystal Star\nis hidden?{[0100|fa000000]} Might as well start looking\nin the biggest building here...
Hint_STG3_05	Let's head back to the Glitz Pit.
Hint_STG3_02	Where do you think the Crystal Star\nis hidden? Maybe it's behind that\nhuge door?
Hint_STG3_03	Let's find whoever's in charge of the\nGlitz Pit and ask to be fighters.{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe\nsomeone knows who to ask...
Hint_STG3_04	We need to meet Grubba, and he's\nthe promoter here...{[0100|fa000000]}so let's check\ninside the promoter's office!
Hint_STG3_61	It looks like we can't become fighters\nunless we sign Grubba's contract...
Hint_STG3_62_first	All we have to do is access the\ncomputer on the wall and choose\n"Ranked Match"! Nice and simple.
Hint_STG3_62	We have to raise your rank to become\nthe champion!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's use the computer\nin the locker room to reserve a match.
Hint_STG3_63	Our match is coming up...{[0100|fa000000]} Are you\nready to throw down, Mario?
Hint_STG3_07	Maybe we should go outside to catch\nour breath...{[0100|fa000000]}and check out the new\nmenu at the hot-dog stand!{[0100|64000000]} Mmm...
Hint_STG3_08	Let's catch that egg!{[0100|fa000000]} Try stunning it\nwith a bop from your hammer!{[0100|64000000]} Or try\nramming into it!{[0100|64000000]} Uh...gently-ish.
Hint_STG3_09	There must be some way to get on top\nof the hot-dog stand...{[0100|fa000000]} Let's take a\nspin around Glitzville and find it!
Hint_STG3_12	We could reach the hot-dog stand\nfrom a high-up spot...{[0100|fa000000]} What about\nthe top of the fresh-juice shop?
Hint_STG3_87	Looks like this egg is sleeping.{[0100|fa000000]} Want to\ntry talking to it?
Hint_STG3_10	We need to keep entering matches so\nyou can become the champion.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's\nhead back to the locker room, OK?
Hint_STG3_entry_Before_yos	Let's go win a match!{[0100|fa000000]} With me by your\nside out there, your opponents won't\nstand a chance!
Hint_STG3_entry_After_yos	Leave it to me, Gonzales!{[0100|fa000000]} With my\nhelp, we'll take down any foes they\nthrow at us—and look cool doing it!
Hint_STG3_66	Let's keep fighting until you're the\nchampion!{[0100|fa000000]} Just use the computer in\nthe locker room to enter a match.
Hint_STG3_11	Let's try going to the watering hole.{[0100|fa000000]}\nI think it was just outside of the\nGlitz Pit, right?
Hint_STG3_78	Well, we came to the watering hole...{[0100|fa000000]}\nWhat should we do now?{[0100|fa000000]} Should we\ntry talking to some folks?
Hint_STG3_13	What do you think "the blockade" is?{[0100|fa000000]}\nI think I remember something big and\nyellow in the corner of a locker room...
Hint_STG3_14	When they say "blockade," do they\nmean that thing in the minor-league\nlocker room?{[0100|fa000000]} Let's try hitting it HARD!
Hint_STG3_15	Are you trying to explore behind that\nlocker-room wall you broke?{[0100|fa000000]} If you feel\nstuck, let me help you out!
Hint_STG3_17	Where was that telephone booth?{[0100|fa000000]}\nDid we see it before?{[0100|fa000000]} Let's take\nanother look around Glitzville.
Hint_STG3_19	Where was that storage room again?{[0100|fa000000]}\nLooks like all we need to do is find a\ndoor that's locked.
Hint_STG3_21	We should look inside the storage\nroom you just unlocked!
Hint_STG3_20	Which switch will grant us access to\nthe second floor?{[0100|fa000000]} Perhaps it's hidden\nbehind something...
Hint_STG3_24	Hey, Gonzales!{[0100|fa000000]} I might be able to\nflutter over gaps that you normally\ncan't cross.{[0100|fa000000]} Let me help out!
Hint_STG3_70	Maybe the new big, yellow block is\njust like the other big, yellow block\nthat was,{[0100|64000000]} y'know,{[0100|64000000]} blocking the wall...
Hint_STG3_82	This is the first time I've ever snooped\nfrom above!{[0100|fa000000]} Ooh, I hope there's a little\nvent we can spy through...
Hint_STG3_27	There must be some way we can slip\nthrough here to get down there...
Hint_STG3_51	It's a shame to take down those\nhandsome posters of you, Mario...{[0100|fa000000]}\nbut if we must, we must!
Hint_STG3_100	Let's claim the key!{[0100|fa000000]} What an odd\nchoice, hiding it behind a poster\nin the lobby like that...
Hint_STG3_30	That last email said, "Go to the\nsecond floor of the storage room."
Hint_STG3_32	We found King K and Bandy Andy!{[0100|fa000000]}\nTalk to them, Mario!{[0100|fa000000]} See if they're OK.
Hint_STG3_33	Well, all we can do for now is continue\nfighting in matches, I guess...
Hint_STG3_35	We must get out of here at once!{[0100|fa000000]}\nOhhh, if only we could simply blow\nsome part of the wall away...
Hint_STG3_85	We need to get out of here!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's try\nevery possible kind of exit that we can\nfit into!
Hint_STG3_36	No way.{[0100|64000000]} Don't tell me we're going to...{[0100|64000000]}\nI mean, there's no way we're actually\ngoing to, uh...{[0100|fa000000]} Ohhh, this better work!
Hint_STG3_37	The match is gonna start soon.\nLet's hurry to the ring!
Hint_STG3_95	Let's try for the champion title again!{[0100|fa000000]}\nJust use the computer in the locker\nroom to enter a match.
Hint_STG3_89	Let's go back to that spot in the\nchampion's room where we heard\nthe voice.{[0100|fa000000]} I'll help you get there!
Hint_STG3_38	Maybe the ventilation cover will open\nif you whack it hard enough to break\none of those big blocks...
Hint_STG3_75	We heard the voice from behind the\nvent inside the champ's room, right?{[0100|fa000000]}\nThen I guess we'd better check it out!
Hint_STG3_43	I wonder what kind of documents are\nhidden in Grubba's desk drawer...{[0100|fa000000]}\nWant to take a quick look?
Hint_STG3_98	I'm curious about Grubba's hidden\ndocuments.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's sneak into his office\nthrough the ventilation duct again!
Hint_STG3_44	Come on, let's chase after Grubba!{[0100|fa000000]}\nHe's probably heading for the ring!
Hint_STG3_55	Grubba's in the ring!{[0100|fa000000]} I'll bet the\nreal-deal Crystal Star is there too!
Hint_STG3_45	The professor said the pipe to\nTwilight Town is below the west\narea of town.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's go!
Hint_STG3_56	Uhhh...{[0100|64000000]}I don't think the pipe we need\nis near here.{[0100|fa000000]} It was "underneath the\nwest part of Rogueport," wasn't it?
Hint_STG3_77	The pipe to Twilight Town should be\nunderneath this area.{[0100|fa000000]} See any way\nto slip straight down there?
Hint_STG3_50	Any time you need to cross a gap,\nyou can count on me, Gonzales!
Hint_STG3_93	Hey, Mario...{[0100|fa000000]} Do you think this is the\npipe to Twilight Town?
Hint_STG3_46	That one pipe definitely leads to\nTwilight Town...{[0100|64000000]}so why did it spit us\nback out?{[0100|fa000000]} Let's ask Professor Frankly.
Hint_STG3_47	Darkly likes dark places, right?{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe\nhe hides in shadowy corners...{[0100|fa000000]}like the\none behind Professor Frankly's house.
Hint_STG3_48	OK, we're all set to enter the pipe to\nTwilight Town!{[0100|fa000000]} Remember the place?{[0100|64000000]}\nIt's under the west part of town.
Hint_STG4_00	Shouldn't we head back to Twilight\nTown?{[0100|fa000000]} We still have important things\nto do there!
Hint_STG4_01	It looks like the Crystal Star is inside\nCreepy Steeple.{[0100|fa000000]} That place is deep in\nthe forest...{[0100|fa000000]}and far from town...
Hint_STG4_02	Let's head to the mayor's house and\nget his permission to pass through the\ntown gate.
Hint_STG4_03	Since the mayor's a pig, we can't get\nhis permission...{[0100|fa000000]} What should we do?{[0100|fa000000]}\nBargain with the gatekeeper, maybe?
Hint_STG4_67	So that's a dead end.{[0100|fa000000]} Hey, didn't we\nhear crying from inside one of the\nhouses? Maybe we can help!
Hint_STG4_81	That poor woman is crying...{[0100|fa000000]} See if\nyou can help her somehow, Mario!
Hint_STG4_68	Well, nothing's getting done until we\ncan get out of the village.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's talk\nto the gatekeeper again.
Hint_STG4_69	Now's our chance!{[0100|fa000000]} Sorry, gatekeeper,\nbut we're gonna pass on through...
Hint_STG4_05	Maybe we can move the big rock in\nfront of the hut...{[0100|fa000000]} Wanna see what \nhappens if we try to push it?
Hint_STG4_71	OK! Let's check inside the hut!
Hint_STG4_02_03_key	I can see something just past the\ndowned tree...{[0100|fa000000]} Should I, uh, scoot\nunderneath with my shell to grab it?
Hint_STG4_48	Think the key we found unlocks the\ndoor to that one shop's storage room?
Hint_STG4_04	"Feel free to take whatever you\nwant out of there."{[0100|fa000000]} That's what\nI heard, so let's take something!
Hint_STG4_82	Let's look for the key to the black\nchest.{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe we should search that\nhut outside of town...
Hint_STG4_72	Let's use that key we found to\nopen the black chest in the shop's\nstorage room!
Hint_STG4_08	If you roll your way under the fallen\ntree outside of town, we might be\nable to pass through...
Hint_STG4_17	This is QUITE a pile of straw here.{[0100|fa000000]}\nImagine what would happen if you\nused my ability on it, oh ho ho!
Hint_STG4_16	There's so much grass growing here,\nit's hard follow the path...{[0100|fa000000]} See any\nspots where you can pass through?
Hint_STG4_18	This tree is splendid...{[0100|64000000]}and suspicious.{[0100|fa000000]}\nI wonder if anything is hidden there.
Hint_STG4_19	When you're in a bind, be sure to\nkeep an eye on the ground, not\njust straight ahead.
Hint_STG4_11	Hey, Mario...{[0100|fa000000]} This hole is covered up.{[0100|fa000000]}\nYou have a sturdy stomp with the\nability to change that!
Hint_STG4_12	This rock looks to be about the same\nsize as the one in front of that shack.{[0100|fa000000]}\nSo if you give it a good push, then...
Hint_STG4_124	Something tells me we're here a bit...{[0100|64000000]}\nearly.{[0100|fa000000]} Does that make sense?{[0100|fa000000]} Let's\nhead back.
Hint_STG4_20	The gate is locked.{[0100|fa000000]} If only there was\nsome other way in...{[0100|fa000000]}or some kind of\nspace to sneak through...
Hint_STG4_87	You OK, Mario?{[0100|fa000000]} Let's head back inside\nCreepy Steeple...
Hint_STG4_21	Where is that Crystal Star hiding?{[0100|fa000000]}\nIt's supposed to be somewhere inside\nCreepy Steeple, isn't it?
Hint_STG4_22	Those marks under the star statue...{[0100|fa000000]}\nIt looks like something was dragged.{[0100|fa000000]}\nDo you think that thing...{[0100|64000000]}moves?
Hint_STG4_24	Ugh, these are all dead ends!{[0100|fa000000]} I wish\nwe could ask somebody for help...{[0100|fa000000]}like\nthat ghost in the hall...
Hint_STG4_25	What's up with all of those ghosts?!{[0100|fa000000]}\nStay focused...{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe those blocked\ndoors will open for us now?
Hint_STG4_09_03	There's a switch here...{[0100|fa000000]} Don't you\nwant to hit it?
Hint_STG4_74	I heard a noise when that switch was\npressed...{[0100|fa000000]}like something heavy moved.{[0100|fa000000]}\nWhich room did it come from?
Hint_STG4_09_03_stairs	That square mark on the floor seems\nto match the staircase.{[0100|fa000000]} Do you think\nit moved somehow?
Hint_STG4_93	We're back in the big hall!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's give\nthe staircase and the corridors a real\ngood look this time.
Hint_STG4_09_03_stairs_01	I wonder...{[0100|fa000000]} Do you think that staircase\nhas always been there?{[0100|fa000000]} Or was it\nmoved somehow?
Hint_STG4_150	Let's look for the key to the door.{[0100|fa000000]}\nHave we checked both of the upper\nwalkways in the main hall yet?
Hint_STG4_09_03_key	There's something past the gap.{[0100|fa000000]}\nI bet I can get it...
Hint_STG4_09_03_key_yoshi	There's something past the gap here.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet me help you get it!
Hint_STG4_62	See a locked door anywhere?{[0100|fa000000]}\nMaybe if we move the stairs to reach\nthe upper walkways in the big hall...
Hint_STG4_99	You can't use partner hints when you\nhave no partners in the party.
Hint_STG4_27	We need to learn that monster's real\nname.{[0100|fa000000]} I bet the crows hear all sorts\nof things...{[0100|fa000000]} Wanna eavesdrop on 'em?{[0004]}When we're near a tree, press {color[4762c0ff]} {color[000000b2]}to\nhide in the shadows.{[0100|fa000000]} Press {color[4762c0ff]} {color[000000b2]}again\nto reappear, hmm hmm!
Hint_STG4_28	A clue about the monster's real name\nis hidden below Creepy Steeple...{[0100|fa000000]}\nGuess we'd better check it out!
Hint_STG4_151	A clue about that monster's real name\nis supposed to be below this steeple...{[0100|fa000000]}\nbut you've been through here before.{[0004]}Did you miss some other way into\nCreepy Steeple?{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe there's\none hidden outside...
Hint_STG4_29	There's a well near the front gate,\nright?{[0100|fa000000]} I'll bet you could remove the\nwooden lid on it somehow...
Hint_STG4_103	There might be places below Creepy\nSteeple that you haven't seen yet.{[0100|fa000000]}\nMaybe the well leads somewhere...
Hint_STG4_104	The path keeps going...{[0100|fa000000]}so I guess we\nshould keep following it.
Hint_STG4_30	You might be able to shove those bars\nforward...{[0100|fa000000]}then I could hide us in the\nshadows.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's work together!
Hint_STG4_31	It's pretty cramped in here...{[0100|fa000000]} Do you\nhave any abilities that can fix that?
Hint_STG4_77	Where do you think that monster is\nhiding his real name?{[0100|fa000000]} Hmm...
Hint_STG4_34	A parrot?{[0100|64000000]} Down here?{[0100|fa000000]} Must be a bit\nshy around strangers...{[0100|fa000000]}but my shadow\nability might let us eavesdrop again...
Hint_STG4_119	So part of that monster's name is\nhidden in this room...{[0100|fa000000]} Let's look for it!
Hint_STG4_131	There's something about that room\nwith the parrot...{[0100|fa000000]} Let's go back.
Hint_STG4_36	Now we know that monster's name!{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's go find him in his earlier spot\nand get your name and body back!
Hint_STG4_37	That monster's name is Doopliss!{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's go find him in his earlier spot\nand get your name and body back!
Hint_STG4_105	Doopliss must have scurried back to\nCreepy Steeple.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's go after him!
Hint_STG4_126	Let's chase after Doopliss!{[0100|fa000000]} If his room\nis hard to find, we could probably try\nmoving the stairs...
Hint_STG4_38	Let's ask the people in Rogueport\nHarbor what they know about\nKeelhaul Key.
Hint_STG4_39	Flavio might help us get a ship.{[0100|fa000000]} Sounds\nlike we can find him at Podley's Place\nin the inn by the town square!
Hint_STG4_40	Once we're ready to go, all we have\nto do is talk to Flavio on his ship in\nRogueport Harbor.
Hint_STG4_41	I wonder where Bobbery is...{[0100|fa000000]} I bet lots\nof rumors flow through Podley's Place.{[0100|fa000000]}\nHow about we try asking him?
Hint_STG4_54	We're looking for a house just past\nthe wall in the eastern part of town...{[0100|fa000000]}\nThat's by the professor!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's ask him.{b}
Hint_STG4_57	Bobbery is supposed to live just to the\nright of Professor Frankly's house.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's go meet him!
Hint_STG4_61	Bobbery's house is locked!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's look\nfor another way in.{[0100|fa000000]} Check it on all\nsides...{[0100|64000000]}and on top too!
Hint_STG4_42	Hey, I can get us to the other side of\nthat river!{[0100|fa000000]} Let me give it a try!
Hint_STG4_125	There's a chimney up on the roof.{[0100|fa000000]}\nIf you take a close look, you can\nsee it has a small opening! 
Hint_STG4_147	This is the house that Podley talked\nabout, right?{[0100|fa000000]} So that means...
Hint_STG4_133	I wonder why Bobbery doesn't want to\nsail anymore...{[0100|fa000000]} There must be a story,\nso we should ask the professor...{[0100|64000000]}or...
Hint_STG4_94	Let's talk to Podley about Bobbery.{[0100|fa000000]}\nMaybe he'll know what's up...
Hint_STG4_55	Bobbery is in his house on the east\nside of town.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's head there and\ngive him Scarlette's letter.
Hint_STG4_50	All right!{[0100|fa000000]} I think we can finally head to\nKeelhaul Key!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's get to Rogueport\nHarbor and set sail.
Hint_STG5_00	Sounds like a hut is ready for us.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's go check it out!
Hint_STG5_02	Let's explore the island.{[0100|fa000000]} I want to see\nhow deep into this jungle we can go!
Hint_STG5_62	When you feel stuck, take a breath,\nthen carefully check the surrounding\narea.{[0100|fa000000]} Even the walls!
Hint_STG5_03	Need help reaching a far-off platform?{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet me help, Gonzales!
Hint_STG5_06	Bobbery did what he could to help\nthe others escape...{[0100|fa000000]} We should go\nback and help him, Mario!
Hint_STG5_12	We can't abandon Bobbery!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's go\nsave him!{[0100|fa000000]} I heard his voice coming\nfrom the area past the rope bridge.
Hint_STG5_09	Hang on, Bobbery!{[0100|fa000000]} We'll save you from\nthose ghosts...{[0100|64000000]}right, Mario?
Hint_STG5_10	Is Bobbery up that tree?!{[0100|fa000000]} He'd better\nbe careful!{[0100|fa000000]} If anything hits the tree,\nhe might fall out of it...
Hint_STG5_11	We need to find some Chuckola Cola\nfor Bobbery.{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe Flavio could help\nus out with this?
Hint_STG5_13	I wonder what sort of native foods\nare growing on this island...{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe\nthe trees are hiding some fruit!
Hint_STG5_14	Guess we found some of this island's\nnative food...{[0100|fa000000]} What should we do\nwith it?{[0100|fa000000]} Think Flavio will take it?
Hint_STG5_29	Look!{[0100|64000000]} You can see a tiny island from\nway out behind the rope bridge.{[0100|fa000000]} We\nshould go check it out somehow.{b}{[0004]}Sure would be nice if there was an\neasy way to get there...
Hint_STG5_80	Hm?{[0100|fa000000]} Oh, sorry, Mario...{[0100|fa000000]} I can't stop\nwondering about that tiny island we\nsaw near the rope bridge...
Hint_STG5_16	Any time you need to cross a gap,\nyou can count on me, Gonzales!
Hint_STG5_15	I bet we can easily grab the stuff\ngrowing in this tree if we give it a\nsolid whack...
Hint_STG5_18	Let's give Bobbery the Chuckola Cola.{[0100|fa000000]}\nHe's waiting up past the rope bridge.
Hint_STG5_19	Oh, poor Bobbery...{[0100|fa000000]} Y-you don't\nthink he's...
Hint_STG5_58	Let's give Bobbery an oh-so-gentle\nwake-up tap, Mario.
Hint_STG5_27	Let's go tell Flavio that Bobbery is OK!
Hint_STG5_21	Let's go check out that skull rock!{[0100|fa000000]}\nIt's sitting in the deepest depths\nof the jungle.
Hint_STG5_28	I think Flavio has something that'll\nfit into the skull rock.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's ask him\nabout it!
Hint_STG5_23	Let's place the Skull Gem into that\nindentation in the rock.
Hint_STG5_24	What should we do with those\n'stached statues?{[0100|fa000000]} Wait...didn't Flavio\nsing something about 'staches?
Hint_STG5_30	"Three times Red 'Stache lands on his\nend!{[0100|64000000]} Blue Stache's belly four times\nis whacked"...{[0004]}The smaller of the two rocks is the one\nwith the red 'stache.{[0100|fa000000]} I'll bet that feels\noddly familiar...right, Mario?
Hint_STG5_31	The top of the skull rock has opened,\nbut we still can't get inside.{[0100|fa000000]} Might this\nbe my time to shine?
Hint_STG5_25	There might be a Crystal Star in the\ngrotto that's deep into the jungle!{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's go check it out.
Hint_STG5_37	Let's head back to the Pirate's\nGrotto, Mario.
Hint_STG5_26	Do you think the Crystal Star could\nbe hiding somewhere in this grotto?{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's look around!
Hint_STG5_34	Those spikes are dangerous...{[0100|fa000000]}but we'll\nbe safe from them if we hide in the\nshadows.{[0100|fa000000]} I'll keep you safe, Mario!
Hint_STG5_47	My legs are so strong and so fast,\nI bet I could rush us past those spikes\nbefore they pop out!
Hint_STG5_61	Those spikes are dangerous.{[0100|fa000000]} Think you\ncould turn papery thin and slip right\nthrough them?
Hint_STG5_66	You can't cross the wide gap on your\nown, Gonzales!{[0100|fa000000]} I'll lend you a hand to\nget us to the other side.{[0100|64000000]} Hop on!
Hint_STG5_40	I do believe there's a switch up there.{[0100|fa000000]}\nStand back!{[0100|64000000]} It's Bobbery's turn in\nthe spotlight!
Hint_STG5_67	If you need to activate that switch at\nthe same time that you're on the lift...{[0100|fa000000]}\nmaybe my ability can help?
Hint_STG5_43	I take it that our goal should be to\nactivate the switch when you're as\nclose to the lift as possible, yes?
Hint_STG5_45	Am I misremembering, or did we see a\nlocked door earlier?
Hint_STG5_48	Spikes are popping out of the wall!{[0100|fa000000]}\nAre there any safe spots in here?{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's look carefully, top to bottom.
Hint_STG5_69	Those spikes are dangerous...{[0100|fa000000]}but we'll\nbe safe from them if we hide in the\nshadows.{[0100|fa000000]} I'll keep you safe, Mario!
Hint_STG5_51	The rock blocking our way is cracked\ndown the middle...{[0100|fa000000]} I might be able to,\nahem, MOTIVATE it out of our way!
Hint_STG5_53	Look, Mario!{[0100|fa000000]} Another black chest...{[0100|fa000000]}\nWe know what to do by now, right?
Hint_STG5_54	Let's make quick work of that ghost\nthe chest mentioned to get the\nBlack Key we need.
Hint_STG5_55	We got the Black Key!{[0100|fa000000]} I'll, uh, let you\ndecide whether we open that black\nchest or not, Mario.
Hint_STG5_57	Haven't we seen a panel with a boat\non it somewhere?{[0100|fa000000]} I think there was\none on top of the big waterfall...
Hint_STG5_110	I bet we could check more areas if the\nsluice gate was open.{[0100|fa000000]} Question is...{[0100|64000000]}\nhow do we get it open?
Hint_STG5_107	Let's keep our eyes peeled while we\ncruise around as a boat.{[0100|fa000000]} We might\nspot something useful.
Hint_STG5_108	We got a Gate Handle!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's look for\na spot where we can use it.{[0100|fa000000]} We can\nreach land by jumping from the boat.
Hint_STG5_63	Let's look for a place where we can\nuse that handle.{[0100|fa000000]} Since the gate is\nnear the giant waterfall, then...
Hint_STG5_64	Let's use your boat trick one more\ntime at the top of the big waterfall\nand see what's past the sluice gate!
Hint_STG5_98	All of the sailors on that boat are\nabout to go down with the ship!{[0100|fa000000]}\nWe have to save them, Mario!
Hint_STG5_65	While flying, you can press {color[dca921ff]} {color[000000b2]}to turn\nback to normal.{[0004]}That might come in handy if\nyou're having trouble landing\nwhere you want.
Hint_STG5_97	Looks like the sailors got across the\nbarrels and made it back to dry land!{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's follow their lead.
Hint_STG5_70	The Crystal Star should be in a ship\nhidden deep within the grotto.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's\ngo find it, Mario!
Hint_STG5_73	We got the Crystal Star!{[0100|fa000000]} Now...{[0100|64000000]}let's\nrejoin Francesca and the others,\nthen find a way out of here!
Hint_STG5_74	Any time you need to cross a gap,\nyou can count on me, Gonzales!
Hint_STG5_75	I suspect I could make quick work of\na cracked wall, old boy.{[0100|fa000000]} Please, allow\nme to assist.
Hint_STG5_76	Time to go, Mario.{[0100|fa000000]} We've "grotto" get\nout of here!
Hint_STG5_77	For now, let's head back to where\nFlavio and the others are.
Hint_STG5_78	Let's visit Cortez!{[0100|fa000000]} We'll get there fast\nif we enter the grotto through that\none busted opening.
Hint_STG5_109	Let's visit Cortez!{[0100|fa000000]} He should be inside\nhis ship.
Hint_STG5_104	I don't think we can reach Cortez\nfrom here.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's head back to where\neveryone else is waiting!
Hint_STG5_81	Guess we should leave for now...
Hint_STG5_82	Guess we'll have to ask Don Pianta for\na ticket to the Excess Express...{[0100|fa000000]} Back\nthrough that west-side shop we go!
Hint_STG5_83	Frankie and Francesca should be in\nKeelhaul Key.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's head over there.
Hint_STG5_105	We need to take Frankie and\nFrancesca to Don Pianta's place...{[0100|fa000000]}\nso let's head back to Keelhaul Key!
Hint_STG5_84	I wonder where Frankie and\nFrancesca are?{[0100|fa000000]} Let's ask around\nand see if anyone knows.
Hint_STG5_88	So Frankie and Francesca went into\nthe jungle?{[0100|fa000000]} Guess we should follow\nthem in there...
Hint_STG5_85	Is that Frankie and Francesca near\nthe water?{[0100|fa000000]} Let's chat with them.
Hint_STG5_86	They said they dropped the Wedding\nRing somewhere on the way to those\nred and blue 'stached statues...
Hint_STG5_89	Thank goodness we found that\nWedding Ring!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's return it to\nFrankie and Francesca.
Hint_STG5_90	We should take the boat back to\nRogueport now.{[0100|fa000000]} Don Pianta is\nprobably waiting for us...
Hint_STG5_92	Let's go see Don Pianta on the west\nside of town.{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe he'll feel better\nafter seeing Francesca and Frankie...
Hint_STG5_93	Time to ride the Excess Express and\nvisit Poshley Heights!{[0100|fa000000]} The station is\nin the west side of town.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's go!
Hint_STG6_01	Let's find the villain behind that\nThreatening Note!{[0100|fa000000]} We should probably\nstart by talking with the train crew.
Hint_STG6_02	Let's tell the conductor about the\nThreatening Note.{[0100|fa000000]} We'll find him at\nthe rear end of the train.
Hint_STG6_03	I can't stop wondering who's behind\nthat Threatening Note...{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe we\nshould explore the train some more?
Hint_STG6_04	Looks like something happened in the\ndining car.{[0100|fa000000]} Should we ask about it?
Hint_STG6_05	I wonder if the stew thief dropped any\nclues in the dining car...
Hint_STG6_07	We'll probably find the thief if we\nfollow the trail of spilled stew!
Hint_STG6_08	The Toad in cabin three is acting kind\nof suspicious.{[0100|fa000000]} He mentioned his own\ndrawer...{[0100|fa000000]} Should we search his cabin?
Hint_STG6_10	The detective is in cabin six.{[0100|fa000000]} Any idea\nwhat he wants to talk about?
Hint_STG6_11	Who's this family...{[0100|fa000000]}and can they really\nblow up a train?!{[0100|fa000000]} We should start by\nchecking the cabins in car four...
Hint_STG6_12	I feel bad for little Bub in cabin eight.{[0100|fa000000]}\nCome on, Mario...{[0100|fa000000]} Let's hear him out!
Hint_STG6_13	Bub wants something that starts with\n"au"...{[0100|fa000000]} What could it be?{[0100|fa000000]} Let's search\nthe train and talk to some witnesses.
Hint_STG6_14	Sounds like little Bub dreams of\nbecoming a train engineer...{[0004]}Think that has anything to do with\nthe thing he wants that starts with\n"au"?{[0100|fa000000]} Let's ask around some more...
Hint_STG6_15	So maybe Bub is looking for an\n"au"tograph from someone he\nadmires.{[0004]}Let's see if we can dig up more\ninfo by asking around.
Hint_STG6_16	So!{[0100|64000000]} Bub wants an "au"tograph from a\ncertain someone...{[0100|fa000000]}but who?{[0100|fa000000]} Could it\nbe someone on this train?
Hint_STG6_17	Let's go over the info we've gathered.{[0100|fa000000]}\nBub wants an "au"tograph from\nsomeone he admires...{[0004]}We also know that Bub wants to be\na train engineer when he grows up.{[0100|fa000000]}\nSo the reasonable conclusion is...
Hint_STG6_43	Let's go over the info we've gathered.{[0100|fa000000]}\nBub wants an "au"tograph from\nsomeone...{[0004]}We also know that Bub wants to be\na train engineer when he grows up.{[0100|fa000000]}\nSo the reasonable conclusion is...
Hint_STG6_18	We've got an autograph from the\ntrain engineer.{[0100|fa000000]} Think this'll make Bub\nhappy?{[0100|fa000000]} Let's visit him in cabin eight.
Hint_STG6_19	The family in cabin eight don't seem\nto be the culprits... {[0100|fa000000]}Maybe we should\ncheck with Pennington in cabin six?
Hint_STG6_20	Let's hear what the conductor has to\nsay.{[0100|fa000000]} He should be in the fourth car.
Hint_STG6_21	The blanket thief might also be behind\nthe Threatening Note!{[0100|fa000000]} Time for a\ntrain-wide investigation.
Hint_STG6_22	Noises were heard coming from cabin\nfour, but no one should be in there.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's go investigate!
Hint_STG6_23	I sense a presence here.{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe they'll\nreveal themselves if we use my ability\nto make them think they're alone...
Hint_STG6_25	The only way we're gonna get that\nblanket back is to hear what the\nghost in cabin four needs help with.
Hint_STG6_26	The ghost's diary should be in the\nbaggage car.{[0004]}Let's go explain everything to the\nconductor in car four and ask him\nto let us check in there.
Hint_STG6_27	Let's search the baggage car for\nthe ghost's diary.
Hint_STG6_28	Where could that diary be?{[0100|fa000000]} Let's look\ncarefully and search each and every\ncorner—even the smallest gaps!
Hint_STG6_29	Let's return the diary to the ghost\nin cabin four.{[0100|fa000000]} The urge to read it is\nstrong...{[0100|64000000]}but we won't give in...{[0100|64000000]}right?
Hint_STG6_31	Let's give the blanket back to the\nconductor!{[0100|fa000000]} Then the poor guy won't\nhave to shiver in the cold anymore.
Hint_STG6_32	It's a good time to call it a night.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's head back to cabin five and\nget some rest.
Hint_STG6_33	We need to find out who wrote that\nthreatening note. {[0100|fa000000]}Maybe Pennington\nin cabin six has news for us?
Hint_STG6_34	Let's search for clues to learn who\nstole that briefcase.{[0100|fa000000]} Check everything\nyou see—even stuff like stray papers!
Hint_STG6_35	The paper we picked up in Zip Toad's\ncabin looks important!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's show it\nto Pennington back in cabin six.
Hint_STG6_36	Let's look for Zip Toad. {[0100|fa000000]}I think we\nshould check each and every cabin.
Hint_STG6_51	Sounds like someone was in our\ncabin, Mario. {[0100|fa000000]}Let's go look.
Hint_STG6_37	The thief might be hiding in here.{[0100|fa000000]}\nMaybe they'll show themselves if we\nhide in the shadows together...
Hint_STG6_38	The thief is probably still in cabin five\nwhere they dropped the document!{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's go back and check things out.
Hint_STG6_39	Zip Toad is hopping all over cabin five!{[0100|fa000000]}\nHe knows he's not THAT kind of toad,\nright?{[0100|fa000000]} Let's catch him!
Hint_STG6_40	We should step out for some fresh air\nas well.{[0100|fa000000]} The exit's up in car one.
Hint_STG6_42	This is Riverside Station. {[0100|fa000000]}Why don't\nwe take this chance to look around?{[0100|fa000000]}\nWe could talk to the station crew too!
Hint_STG6_44	So...{[0100|64000000]}the train can't go anywhere while\nthe drawbridge is up.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's help the\nstation crew out!
Hint_STG6_46	The switch for the drawbridge is\nlocated somewhere below the station.{[0100|fa000000]}\nQuestion is...{[0100|64000000]}how do we get there?
Hint_STG6_113	Maybe we could get through here if\nyou used one of your abilities?
Hint_STG6_114	Sometimes it helps to take a step back\nand just watch...{[0100|fa000000]} Let's study the way\nthese gears move before we cross.
Hint_STG6_50	Let's move forward carefully.{[0100|fa000000]} Look for\nany gaps we can slip through or spots\nwe can stand on!
Hint_STG6_51_nok	There's something on that platform.{[0100|fa000000]}\nI bet you can get it with my help...{[0100|64000000]}\nif you want to, that is.
Hint_STG6_51_yos	There's something on that platform.{[0100|fa000000]}\nI bet I could get us over there,\nno sweat!
Hint_STG6_101	Hey, Mario...{[0100|fa000000]}wasn't there something\nimportant in the far side of that room\nwith all the gears?
Hint_STG6_52	There must be some place here where\nwe can use the key we found...
Hint_STG6_55	So many posters all over the wall...{[0100|fa000000]}\nI'm certain I could whip up a strong\ngust of wind to blow them all away!
Hint_STG6_57	Let's look carefully for any spots you\nmight be able to sneak through...
Hint_STG6_58	It's like a maze in here!{[0100|fa000000]} We'll have to\nremember the path we've taken so we\ndon't get lost.
Hint_STG6_102	I see a key up high over there, but I\ndon't think we can reach it yet.
Hint_STG6_60	The Goombas near the boxes are in\nour way.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's teach those loiterers\na lesson, Mario!
Hint_STG6_61	What do you think the numbers on\nthe switches mean?{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe they're,\nlike...a counter?
Hint_STG6_98	That wall switch popped out!
Hint_STG6_63	That is one big treasure chest...
Hint_STG6_64	I'll bet your Spring Jump could launch\nyou high enough to grab pipes way up\nabove you...
Hint_STG6_65	Now we need to get out of here...{[0100|fa000000]}\nWith any luck, there'll be some kind\nof gap we can slip through.
Hint_STG6_66	You see that key way up high, right?{[0100|fa000000]}\nI could get us closer to it by helping\nyou cross a gap!
Hint_STG6_104	We left the key behind in that\nunderground office.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's go get it!
Hint_STG6_68	I'm curious about that key up there...{[0100|fa000000]}\nThink you could put that Spring Jump\nyou learned to good use?
Hint_STG6_70	If we use the Elevator Key on the\nelevator near the entrance, it'll\nprobably work again!
Hint_STG6_105	Any idea where an elevator might be\nhiding in this place?{[0100|fa000000]} Let's just head\nback to the station entrance for now.
Hint_STG6_110	Think there's an elevator around\nhere somewhere?
Hint_STG6_115	We need to lower the drawbridge.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's head back to the switch room!
Hint_STG6_71	What are those weird things?!{[0100|fa000000]}\nCan you drive them away using\nyour hammer?
Hint_STG6_71_nok	What are those gross creatures?{[0100|fa000000]}\nI can help you drive them away if\nyou want...
Hint_STG6_71_win	What are those icky things?{[0100|fa000000]} I might\nbe able to help you drive them away...
Hint_STG6_71_bom	What are those foul creatures?{[0100|fa000000]}\nI stand ready to blow them out\nof our way on your order!
Hint_STG6_72	There was a lever hidden under all\nthose weird creatures...
Hint_STG6_73	A switch!{[0100|fa000000]} It's the switch-room switch!{[0100|fa000000]}\nI guess we'd better switch it, huh?
Hint_STG6_74	Do you think the drawbridge got\nlowered? {[0100|fa000000]}Let's get out of here.
Hint_STG6_75	Looks like the drawbridge was\nlowered correctly!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's make our\nway back onboard the train.
Hint_STG6_76	It won't be long until we reach Poshley\nHeights.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's call it a day and get\nsome sleep.
Hint_STG6_77	We've still got time before we arrive at\nPoshley Heights.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's walk around to\nadmire the train before the trip ends!
Hint_STG6_78	I'm worried about all of the other\npassengers! Let's go make sure\nthey're OK.{[0004]}We should check this whole train,\nfront to back!
Hint_STG6_79	What is up with those gross critters in\nthe baggage car?!{[0100|fa000000]} Quick, smack 'em\nwith your hammer, Mario!
Hint_STG6_79_nok	Let's drive those gross creatures out\nof the baggage car!{[0100|fa000000]} I'll help!
Hint_STG6_79_win	We must drive those icky creatures\nout of the baggage car!{[0100|fa000000]} Allow me\nto assist, dear!
Hint_STG6_79_bom	We must drive those pesky things out\nof the baggage car!{[0100|fa000000]} I'll help you blast\nthem—{[0100|64000000]} Err, persuade them to leave!
Hint_STG6_80	Mario!{[0100|fa000000]} We need to do something about\nall of those gross creatures in the\nbaggage car!
Hint_STG6_81	Let's chase after those creatures!{[0100|fa000000]}\nWe could take the high road if you\ngrab that hanging pipe...
Hint_STG6_116	We have to chase after those icky\ncreatures!{[0100|fa000000]} They escaped through\nthe back of the baggage car.
Hint_STG6_82	There's so many of them!{[0100|fa000000]} Drive them\naway with your hammer so we can\nkeep moving forward!
Hint_STG6_82_nok	We need to keep moving forward!{[0100|fa000000]}\nCan you use your hammer to drive\nthem away?{[0100|fa000000]} I'll help out too!
Hint_STG6_82_win	We must make our way through these\nicky fiends!{[0100|fa000000]} Give them a taste of your\nhammer, Mario!{[0100|fa000000]} I'll help out as well.
Hint_STG6_82_bom	Hmph!{[0100|64000000]} We'll have to make our way\nthrough these pests.{[0100|fa000000]} Drive them off\nwith your hammer.{[0100|fa000000]} I shall assist you!
Hint_STG6_83	Let's head to Poshley Sanctum.{[0100|fa000000]}\nThe exit for the train is in car one.
Hint_STG6_84	Let's head to Poshley Sanctum.{[0100|fa000000]} Do\nyou think we can get there if we just\nfollow the road?
Hint_STG6_106	How can we get inside Poshley\nSanctum?{[0100|fa000000]} Guess we should take a\ngood look around.
Hint_STG6_85	OK, Mario!{[0100|64000000]} Time to head inside\nPoshley Sanctum.
Hint_STG6_86	The  marks on the floor sure stand\nout in here...{[0100|fa000000]} Think they're supposed\nto be some kind of sign?
Hint_STG6_87	The Crystal Star has to be in\nPoshley Sanctum somewhere!
Hint_STG6_88	A Crystal Star!{[0100|fa000000]} Hidden inside the\nsanctum's picture!{[0100|fa000000]} Can you believe\nit, Mario?
Hint_STG6_89	Now that we've got the Crystal Star...{[0100|64000000]}\nlet's get out of here!
Hint_STG6_92	Let's kill some time outside while we\nwait for Professor Frankly to finish...{[0100|fa000000]}\nWe should check back in a bit though.
Hint_STG6_92_01	I wouldn't be surprised if the professor\nis done by now.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's speak with\nhim again.
Hint_STG6_93	Let's look for the Ultra Hammer.{[0100|fa000000]} It's in\na place that stands out somewhere in\nRogueport...{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe the town square?
Hint_STG6_94	Let's look for the Ultra Hammer...{[0100|fa000000]}if we\ncan avoid staring at the giant chest\nhere, that is.{[0100|fa000000]} It really...{[0100|64000000]}stands out...
Hint_STG6_95	Let's find the pipe that leads to Fahr\nOutpost.{[0100|fa000000]} I bet it's under the west side.{[0100|fa000000]}\nCall it...{[0100|64000000]}Goomba's intuition!
Hint_STG6_109	Off to Fahr Outpost!{[0100|fa000000]} I think your Ultra\nHammer already cleared the way to\nthe pipe in the west-side sewers.
Hint_STG6_96	The pipe to Fahr Outpost must be\naround here somewhere, right?
Hint_STG7_00	Let's make our way to Fahr Outpost.{[0100|fa000000]}\nIt's just up ahead...{[0100|fa000000]}and it'll be warmer\nthan this spot, I hope.{[0100|64000000]} Brrr!
Hint_STG7_79	Let's head back to Fahr Outpost.{[0100|fa000000]}\nWe have stuff to do there!
Hint_STG7_01	Where is this cannon that can shoot\nus to the moon?{[0100|fa000000]} Let's try asking the\nlocals about it.
Hint_STG7_02	Mario, old boy...{[0100|fa000000]} Perhaps the outpost\nmayor will be more receptive if I guide\nthe negotiation, Bob-omb to Bob-omb.
Hint_STG7_03	Goldbob is Bub's father, right?{[0100|fa000000]} Where\ndid we last see him?{[0004]}As for General White...do you have\nany idea where he might be?{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe\nsome quiet, peaceful town?
Hint_STG7_04	Our next step is to locate General\nWhite.{[0100|fa000000]} It wouldn't surprise me if he\nwas in some quiet, peaceful town.
Hint_STG7_05	General White is probably in\nPetalburg.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's head over there.
Hint_STG7_40	We should let the mayor of Fahr\nOutpost know that General White\nis back.
Hint_STG7_06	Goldbob is supposed to be in Poshley\nHeights.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's go talk to him.
Hint_STG7_08	We can't just TELL Goldbob in Poshley\nHeights that we're serious about using\nthe cannon...{[0100|fa000000]} We'll have to SHOW him!{b}
Hint_STG7_09	I wonder if we'll find General White\nhere somewhere.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's ask the locals\nif they know anything.
Hint_STG7_38	I wonder if any of the locals have seen\nGeneral White. Let's ask around.
Hint_STG7_10	It sounds like General White took off\nfor a southern island...{[0100|fa000000]} Oh! He must\nhave traveled out to...y'know...
Hint_STG7_35	Let's ask around if anyone has seen\nGeneral White.
Hint_STG7_11	Supposedly General White took off for\na city floating in the sky.{[0100|fa000000]} There can't\nbe THAT many of those, right?
Hint_STG7_84	I wonder if any of the locals have seen\nGeneral White. Let's ask around.
Hint_STG7_12	We heard that General White took\noff for a huge tree in a forest. {[0100|fa000000]}Well,\nI only know one of those...
Hint_STG7_86	Let's ask the Punies if any of them\nhave seen General White.
Hint_STG7_13	General White took off for a dark\nplace.{[0100|fa000000]} That reminds me of a place\nwe visited...
Hint_STG7_85	I wonder if any of the locals have seen\nGeneral White. Let's ask around.
Hint_STG7_14	We learned that General White took\noff while looking very tired.{[0004]}When I'm tired, I always want to go\nback home...{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe that's just me.
Hint_STG7_15	Where do you think General White\nwould go to rest?
Hint_STG7_16	We found a sleeping Bob-omb that's\nsuitably snowy-white...{[0100|fa000000]} Let's see if\nwe can wake him up!
Hint_STG7_42	Let's head back to the house where\nwe found the snowy-colored Bob-omb.
Hint_STG7_17	Don't give up!{[0100|fa000000]} Keep going until\nGeneral White wakes up!
Hint_STG7_69	We should be able to use the cannon\nnow. {[0100|fa000000]}Let's report back to the mayor\nof Fahr Outpost.
Hint_STG7_68	Almost time to blast off to the moon!{[0100|fa000000]}\nAre you ready?{[0100|fa000000]} Just make sure you're\nprepared before talking to the mayor.
Hint_STG7_18	I guess the moon is just rocks, rocks,\nand...{[0100|64000000]}more rocks.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's look for clues\nabout the princess or the Crystal Star.
Hint_STG7_74	That building back there is mighty\nsuspicious if you ask me...{[0100|fa000000]} Let's search\nfor a way to get over there.{[0100|64000000]} I'll assist!
Hint_STG7_19	We should head inside this building.{[0100|fa000000]}\nThere might be a clue in there about\nPrincess Peach or the Crystal Star!
Hint_STG7_20	What do you think this building is for?{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's keep moving forward for now...
Hint_STG7_87	We should probably go back inside\nthe building...
Hint_STG7_70	Let's head back inside the X-Naut\nFortress.{[0100|fa000000]} I'm sure Princess Peach and\nthe Crystal Star are both inside!
Hint_STG7_21	Princess Peach and the Crystal Star\nshould be in this building somewhere!{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's check every corner...
Hint_STG7_25	I guess you can't use this elevator\nunless you have a key.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's look\naround for one.
Hint_STG7_22	I'm not seeing any clues to help us\nfind Princess Peach or the Crystal\nStar here.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's look somewhere else.
Hint_STG7_24	Glowing panels...{[0100|fa000000]} Can you memorize\nthe path?{[0100|fa000000]} If you need to clear your\nhead, try exiting and reentering.{b}
Hint_STG7_26	We can use the key we got to operate\nthe elevator.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's try checking out a\ndifferent level.
Hint_STG7_27	Have we checked everything on this\nlevel? {[0100|fa000000]}If so, then we should probably\nmove to a different one...
Hint_STG7_28	We need an access code.{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe\nsomeone wrote it down somewhere?{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's explore beyond sublevel one...
Hint_STG7_37	Did you find the access code?{[0100|fa000000]}\nOnce we have it, let's use the\nterminal on sublevel one.
Hint_STG7_39	Where the heck are we?
Hint_STG7_43	It's hard to know where to go when\nthe ground doesn't light up. {[0100|fa000000]}Maybe\nthere's a hint in this room?
Hint_STG7_61	We can't use the elevator without a\nkey...{[0100|fa000000]} We're gonna have to challenge\nthe angry-face guy on sublevel one.
Hint_STG7_31	Let's get that Elevator Key.{[0100|fa000000]} It should\nbe inside the treasure chest from that\nangry-face guy on sublevel one.
Hint_STG7_73	The key we got must operate the\nelevator!{[0100|fa000000]} I think the one with a red\npanel was on sublevel two...
Hint_STG7_32	That enemy from sublevel four\ndropped something.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's make\nsure we pick it up!
Hint_STG7_63	Take any Security Keys we find to\nthe far-right room on sublevel three!{[0100|fa000000]}\nLooks like we'll need four of them...
Hint_STG7_66	Have we checked all the rooms\non sublevel three?{[0100|fa000000]} Did we miss\nsomething?
Hint_STG7_64	We've got all the Security Keys!{[0100|fa000000]} Now \nlet's use them on the terminals in the\nfar-right room on sublevel three.
Hint_STG7_65	There's only one glowing floor panel.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's go stand on it!
Hint_STG7_67	Let's step carefully.{[0100|fa000000]} We don't want to\nstep outside of the glowing panels.
Hint_STG7_44	We must be getting close to Princess\nPeach and the Crystal Star.{[0100|fa000000]} Hurry,\nMario, hurry!
Hint_STG7_45	With judicious use of blasting, I think\nwe could activate the switch behind\nthat fence.
Hint_STG7_46	That conveyor floor is odd.{[0100|fa000000]} Can we\nreach it somehow?{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe we could\njust slip through a gap...
Hint_STG7_47	Could we get through if we used the\nmoving floor to our advantage?{[0100|fa000000]} I think\nI can help with that!
Hint_STG7_71	See that thing in the middle of the\nroom?{[0100|fa000000]} It must have been left behind.{[0100|fa000000]}\nI wish we could just fly over there...{b}
Hint_STG7_59	There should be a terminal where\nwe can use the Security Key we got.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's start looking for it.
Hint_STG7_60	Let's put the Security Key we got into\nthe terminal.
Hint_STG7_52	Let's head back to Rogueport so we\ncan tell Professor Frankly about the\nCrystal Stars and Princess Peach.
Hint_STG7_53	Why are the doors locked?{[0100|fa000000]} Weird...{[0100|fa000000]}\nI guess we'll have to poke around\nelsewhere for now.
Hint_STG7_54	Let's use the teleporter on sublevel\ntwo to head back to Rogueport.
Hint_STG7_56	Let's go tell Professor Frankly about\nthe Crystal Stars and Princess Peach.
Hint_STG7_78	Let's get to the Thousand-Year Door\nso we can open it and save Princess\nPeach!{[0100|fa000000]} It's on sublevel three!
Hint_STG7_58	Let's enter the Palace of Shadow.{[0100|fa000000]}\nWe have to save Princess Peach!
Hint_STG8_56	Where could Princess Peach be? I'm\nworried...{[0100|fa000000]} Let's hurry and find her!
Hint_STG8_77	What are you doing, Mario?{[0100|fa000000]} Let's get\nback to the Palace of Shadow and\nsave Princess Peach!
Hint_STG8_0	Spike traps, huh?{[0100|fa000000]} They could pop up\nanywhere...{[0100|fa000000]} We'll just have to be slow\nand careful, one step at a time.
Hint_STG8_2_viv	Those flames just keep on coming...{[0100|fa000000]}\nMaybe we can avoid them by using\nmy ability!
Hint_STG8_2_kur	Those flames just keep coming, huh?{[0100|fa000000]}\nMaybe we can roll under them...{[0100|64000000]}or get\nover 'em some other way.
Hint_STG8_1	We just need to catch that one dark\nenemy.{[0100|fa000000]} Try scattering the others with\nyour hammer!
Hint_STG8_69	That one dark enemy dropped a key!
Hint_STG8_5	We're back in the same place as\nbefore.{[0100|fa000000]} Did we go the wrong way\nsomehow?
Hint_STG8_6	There must be a way for us to get\nthrough here.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's check the walls\nand doors for anything unusual...
Hint_STG8_13	There's a suspicious tower across the\nwater...{[0100|fa000000]}but I want to study those\nopen-mouthed statues first!
Hint_STG8_37	Where do you think the pipe that\nappeared under the statue leads?
Hint_STG8_71	Strange place for a switch, huh?{[0100|fa000000]}\nGuess we should press it...
Hint_STG8_78	I think something happened!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's\ncheck around for any other tricks.
Hint_STG8_15	Sounds like something happened\nagain.{[0100|fa000000]} Do you think we can reach\nthe tower now?
Hint_STG8_58	I want to study that tower across the\nmoat...{[0100|fa000000]} Think we can reach it with one\nof your abilities, Mario?
Hint_STG8_16	Let's check out the tower!
Hint_STG8_60	This place is so quiet!{[0100|fa000000]} For now,\nlet's use the stairs and see what's\nup there.
Hint_STG8_79	I wonder what that pedestal in front\nof the orrery is used for...
Hint_STG8_8	The pedestal in the tower has an\nindent to insert something...{[0004]}If we can't find anything in this tower,\nit must be hidden elsewhere... Is there\nsome area we haven't explored yet?
Hint_STG8_2	Remember that Star Stone we got?{[0100|fa000000]}\nDon't you think it'd fit in the indent\nin this pedestal nicely?
Hint_STG8_9	Where do you think this leads?{[0100|fa000000]}\nGuess we'll just have to keep going\nand find out.
Hint_STG8_7	Let's keep looking for something that\nfits in the tower's pedestal.{[0100|fa000000]} Did we\ncheck the chest Gloomtail dropped?
Hint_STG8_10	Gloomtail dropped a treasure chest!{[0100|fa000000]}\nWonder what's inside...{[0100|fa000000]} Let's check!
Hint_STG8_11_kur_key00	I wonder where we're supposed to use\nthis Star Stone we found.{[0100|fa000000]} Did we\ntotally miss something earlier?
Hint_STG8_11_kur_key01	You know that Star Stone we got?{[0100|fa000000]}\nI saw something with that same shape\nin the tower...{[0100|fa000000]} Think they're related?
Hint_STG8_11_kur_key02	Let's try putting the Star Stone in\nthe pedestal.
Hint_STG8_14	We haven't fully explored the tower.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's go back!
Hint_STG8_17	The eight pillars on the third floor\nhave keyholes in them...{[0100|fa000000]} Guess we\nshould be on the hunt for eight keys!
Hint_STG8_59	Look, Mario! There's a plaque on the\nwall.{[0100|fa000000]} Don't you want to know what's\nwritten on it?
Hint_STG8_51	Doesn't seem like there's anything\nleft to do in this room.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's leave.
Hint_STG8_73	It's unlike you to leave a mysterious\nchest sitting unopened, Mario.
Hint_STG8_18	Twin rooms?{[0100|fa000000]} Think that means two\nrooms that look the same?{[0100|fa000000]} The blocks\nin here are kind of suspicious too...
Hint_STG8_19	The rooms on the first and second\nfloors seem identical, so...{[0100|fa000000]} Hey, wait!{[0100|fa000000]}\nAren't there fewer blocks in here?!
Hint_STG8_80	Let's press that blue switch!
Hint_STG8_81	"Retreat" must describe walking back\ntoward the door.{[0100|fa000000]} The repetition of the\nword must be some kind of clue too...
Hint_STG8_20	Nothing's happening...{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe we\nshould leave this room for a minute\nto clear our heads.
Hint_STG8_21	So we need to defeat all these jerks in\norder, weak to strong.{[0100|fa000000]} Dull Bones with\ngreen shoes are super weak, right?{[0004]}This might be tricky.{[0100|fa000000]} If we battle the\nwrong enemy, let's just exit, reenter,\nand try again!
Hint_STG8_27	So we need to defeat them in order,\nstarting with the weakest...{[0100|fa000000]} If we mess\nup, let's exit and reenter to try again.
Hint_STG8_22	If we can't SEE something, but we can\nFEEL it, then there must be something\nthere!{[0100|fa000000]} This is quite unusual...
Hint_STG8_23	Does that hint mean that as long as\nwe're visible in here, the important\nthing in this room will...{[0100|64000000]}disappear?
Hint_STG8_29	Oooh, that blue switch appears when\nwe hide...{[0100|fa000000]} Neat trick!{[0100|64000000]} Let's remember\nwhere it is so we can press it.
Hint_STG8_24	If we try touching it, we'll pass right\nthrough...{[0100|fa000000]}so the only things we can\ntouch are the walls!
Hint_STG8_82	Let's try pressing that blue switch.{[0100|fa000000]}\nI never imagined we'd be able to walk\nright through a wall!
Hint_STG8_25	Sounds like we need to walk straight\nfrom the entrance, but when we do,\nwe hit a wall!{[0100|fa000000]} Can we bust it down?
Hint_STG8_83	The wall broke apart.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's\nlook around.
Hint_STG8_26	Now we have all eight keys!{[0100|fa000000]} Time to\nfinally solve the mystery of the third-\nfloor pillars...
Hint_STG8_32	What was that huge sound?!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's go\ncheck things out!
Hint_STG8_75	We've got to save Princess Peach!{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's press on and see what's waiting\nfor us beyond the courtyard.
Hint_STG8_76	We've got to save Princess Peach!{[0100|fa000000]}\nI know you'll help her, Mario...{[0100|64000000]}and\nwe'll all help you help her!
Hint_STG8_33	A dead end.{[0100|fa000000]} Looks like it is time for\nme to take the stage once more!
Hint_STG8_35	There's a platform in front of that\nhole in the wall.{[0100|fa000000]} I can probably get\nus over there, y'know!
Hint_STG8_37_nok	If you need to hit a switch from a\ndistance, let me!{[0100|fa000000]} I want to help.
Hint_STG8_37_bom	If we work together, old boy, then\nwe can make quick work of switches\nthat are just out of reach!
Hint_STG8_28	That big block is living up to its name.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's try the nearby hallway instead.
Hint_STG8_61	Don't you think the switches in this\nhallway and the blocks in the next\none look similar?{[0100|fa000000]} Or is it just me?
Hint_STG8_74	You may rely on me, old boy, when\nyou need to press a switch while\nyou're on top of a block.
Hint_STG8_37_yos	Any time you need to cross a gap,\nyou can count on me, Gonzales!
Hint_STG8_65	I bet we'd be able to make headway\nif we got on the red block, then used\nyour or a partner's abilities, Mario.
Hint_STG8_86_kur	This is a really narrow space, but I'm\nsure you can shrink down and find a\nway across with one of your abilities.
Hint_STG8_36_yos	This space is pretty narrow, but we\ncan get through here with my help,\nGonzales!{[0100|fa000000]} I've got this!
Hint_STG8_38	I'll bet we can find a way forward\nhidden here somewhere.{[0100|fa000000]} Y'know,\nlike a tiny gap or something...
Hint_STG8_39	If you ever feel stuck...{[0100|64000000]}try looking up!{[0100|fa000000]}\nYou might discover a way forward.
Hint_STG8_40	If we work together, old boy, then\nwe can make quick work of switches\nthat are just out of reach!
Hint_STG8_43_nok	There's something sitting just out of\nreach...{[0100|fa000000]} I think I can get it for you...
Hint_STG8_43_yos	See that thing sitting out of reach?{[0100|fa000000]}\nI could get us over there to grab it!
Hint_STG8_42	That Palace Key we got must open\na door around here somewhere...{[0100|fa000000]}\nLet's look around.
Hint_STG8_44	It's a tight squeeze to get through\nhere...{[0100|fa000000]} Mario, can you make yourself\nsmaller and continue on?
Hint_STG8_45	There's a lot of  marks.{[0100|fa000000]} Wasn't there\nanother place nearby with a bunch\nof  marks too?
Hint_STG8_47	It's a dead end, dear, but I'm certain\nsomething is hidden here.
Hint_STG8_48	Keep a close eye on where you're\nstepping.{[0100|fa000000]} Take it one step at a time,\nno need to rush.{[0100|64000000]} We'll get there.
Hint_STG8_55	Let's use the plane to get farther\ndown the hall.{[0100|fa000000]} You can press {color[dca921ff]} {color[000000b2]}to\nabruptly return to normal while flying.
Hint_STG8_52	I'm speedy, so if you need to get\nsomewhere in a flash, leave it to me!
Hint_STG8_57	There's this...dark, oppressive feeling\ncoming from deep in the palace...{[0100|fa000000]}\nPrincess Peach might be up ahead!
Hint_STG8_36	Princess Peach is probably just a little\nbit farther.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's go, Mario!
Hint_STG8_54	Trouble! Princess Peach was taken\ninto the depths of the palace!{[0100|fa000000]} Let's\ngo after them!
Hint_STG9_01	Let's fight our way to the lowest level!{[0100|fa000000]}\nMake sure I Tattle on any enemies we\nhaven't seen before, OK?

Hint_STG9_03	Didn't expect such a rare critter to\npop up way down here...{[0100|fa000000]} Whatever\nyou do, Mario, DON'T hit it!{[0100|fa000000]} I mean it!
Hint_STG9_19	Items like to hide sometimes, so check\nbehind objects while you explore.{[0100|fa000000]} You\nmight find goodies...{[0100|64000000]}even Star Pieces!{b}
Hint_STG9_20	Allow yourself quiet moments to study\nyour surroundings.{[0100|fa000000]} You might discover\nthings...{[0100|64000000]}like thin gaps to slip through.{b}{[0004]}On that note, if you spot any cracks\nin walls or surfaces, leave them to me!{b}
Hint_STG9_21	We've gathered a lot of info...{[0100|fa000000]} If you\never need a refresher, you can study\nour Journal by pressing !{b}
Hint_STG9_04	Rogueport is a delightful town, Mario!{[0100|fa000000]}\nThere's much more to it than simple\nshops and a game-filled parlor.{b}{[0004]}There are vendors who can make us\nmore powerful and brokers who may\nshare valuable information...{b}{[0004]}And there's the Happy Lucky Lottery\nas well!{[0100|fa000000]} It might be fun to test our luck\nsometime, don't you agree?{b}
Hint_STG9_22	Hey, Mario...{[0100|64000000]}can we take on the\nPit of 100 Trials beneath Rogueport?{b}{[0004]}I'd like to try, if it's OK.{[0100|fa000000]} Adventuring\nthrough the lower levels might help\nme become even tougher, y'know?{b}
Hint_STG9_23	You do know I love to sniff out hidden\ngoodies, right?{[0100|fa000000]} A tap of {color[4762c0ff]} {color[000000b2]}from you is\nmy cue to search the immediate area!{b}
Hint_STG9_24	I've heard of a place below Rogueport\nthat's, like, a pit...{[0100|fa000000]}and the deeper you\ngo, the stronger the enemies are...{b}{[0004]}That might be a good place to put our\nskills to the test.{[0100|fa000000]} I might become a bit\nstronger too, I guess...{b}
Hint_STG9_25	Say, my sweet hunk of party cheese...{[0100|fa000000]}\nhave you discovered any badges that\nchange the color of your clothes?{b}{[0004]}I've heard one such badge is inside a\nfancy sanctum, pretty as a picture...{[0100|fa000000]}\nAnother is with a certain merchant...{b}
Hint_STG9_26	If someone has a problem they can't\nsolve, they'll post a request inside the\nTrouble Center in east Rogueport.{b}{[0004]}Makes you think, right?{[0100|fa000000]} Everyone has\nto deal with some kind of hardship...{[0100|fa000000]}\nI'd like to help them all, if we can.{b}
Hint_STG9_31	Hey, Mario...{[0100|fa000000]}have you ever heard of\nthe Pit of 100 Trials?{b}{[0004]}Rumors say there's a pipe near the\nThousand-Year Door that can take\nus there.{[0100|fa000000]} Maybe this is the spot...{b}

gor_luigi_talk_0001	Well, like I said, it's a really long\nstory, but here goes...{b}{[0004]}As soon as my ship docked on the\nPudding Continent, I set out for\nthe volcano.{b}{[0004]}To reach my destination, I spent\nseveral days fording through\ndense jungle...{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}Scary beasts were all over!{[0100|fa000000]} More than\nonce I thought I was done for, Bro!{b}{[0004]}I may have screamed a bit.{[0100|fa000000]} To scare\nthem off, you know.{[0100|fa000000]} But as fate would\nhave it...{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}a Blooper named Blooey heard me\nshrieking and found me in this\none town.{b}{[0004]}Blooey was on a journey of his own,\nbut he joined me after hearing\nmy tale.{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}Now, Blooey's a madman.{[0100|fa000000]} Back\nin his hometown, they call him\n"White Torpedo"!{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}Yeah, he's a tough guy.{[0100|fa000000]} Anyway,\nhe helped me fight to Rumblebump\nVolcano.{b}{[0004]}This place was all about bubbling\nlava pools and heat that'd make the\nsun sweat.{b}{[0004]}AND the place was lousy with evil\ntraps designed to protect the\ncompass piece.{b}{[0004]}The scariest one of all was this\ngigantic, 100-foot-tall statue that\nstomped around.{b}{[0004]}Now, the weakness of this giant\nstatue, Bro, was a red gem on\nits forehead...{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}Now, I can jump high, but not high\nenough to reach this thing by a\nlong shot.{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}So I came up with this plan for Blooey\nto hit that weak spot! {[0100|fa000000]}"All you, man!"\nI said!{b}{[0004]}I waited for a pause in the statue's\nmovements and hucked Blooey\nup there!{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}And bull's-eye! {[0100|fa000000]}The White Torpedo\nsaved the day!{[0100|fa000000]} That jewel got\nwhacked!{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}It was a critical hit, and that\nstone statue toppled and crumbled\ninto pieces!{b}{[0004]}Once that was done, it was an\neasy stroll to the room where the\ntreasure was.{b}{[0004]}Unfortunately, Princess Eclair was\nnowhere to be found...{b}{[0004]}But I got another piece of the\nMarvelous Compass, and put it in\nthe base...{b}{[0004]}Now the compass pointed west, to\nPlumpbelly Village on the Strudel\nContinent.{b}{[0004]}So I set sails once again and came\nback here to Rogueport to recharge.{b}{[0004]}That's what happened to me lately,\nbut I'll be heading back out soon...{b}

gor_luigi_talk_0002	Well, like I said, it's a really long story,\nbut here goes...{b}{[0004]}Once we made landfall on the\nStrudel Continent, we made for\nPlumpbelly Village.{b}{[0004]}Once we got there, though, we\nimmediately noticed that something\nwas wrong.{b}{[0004]}We learned from the mayor that the\ntown was ruled by a giant snake\nnamed Hizza!{b}{[0004]}He said the beast demanded he\noffer up his own daughter as a\nsacrifice too!{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}So, of course, being heroic, I offered\nmyself up to go in her stead!{[0100|fa000000]}\nBrave, huh?{b}{[0004]}Now, the custom was for sacrifices\nto be dressed as brides, so I got all\ndolled up...{b}{[0004]}I was one hot sacrifice, Bro.{[0100|fa000000]} I looked\nso good, I fooled our foes and got in\nHizza's lair.{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}It was kind of rough fighting in that\ngown, but I managed.{[0100|fa000000]} Chiffon really\nchafes, Bro!{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}I finally found Hizza...and the snake\nhad a second head on its tail! {[0100|fa000000]}Talk\nabout scary!{b}{[0004]}I fainted real quick, but when I\ncame to, I managed to distract\nboth heads...{b}{[0004]}It reared up, fangs bared to attack,\nand at that moment, I deftly\nlunged left!{b}{[0004]}His gaping mouths smashed into one\nanother...and he vanished in a cloud\nof smoke!{b}{[0004]}A shining plate fell down on the spot\nwhere Hizza's body had been coiled...{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}Yes!{[0100|fa000000]} Another compass piece!{[0100|fa000000]} I set it,\nand it pointed east, to Circuit Break\nIsland!{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}Just as I was about to leave town,\nthe mayor asked me to stay and\nmarry his daughter.{b}{[0004]}I thought about it—she was sorta\ncute—but we ended up sneaking off\nthe next morning.{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}I mean, I still have to save Princess\nEclair from the Chestnut King!{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}And...when the Marvelous Compass\nactivated this time, I heard\nsomebody's voice.{b}{[0004]}It was so beautiful, Bro...{[0100|fa000000]} I'm certain it\nwas Princess Eclair's voice!{b}{[0004]}My heart began to race!{[0100|fa000000]} That's\nwhen I realized it—{[0100|fa000000]}Princess Eclair...{[0100|fa000000]}\nI think I...{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}Oh! {[0100|fa000000]}I kinda zoned out there.{[0100|fa000000]} Umm...\n{[0100|fa000000]}So, yeah.{[0100|fa000000]} We set sail again after\nditching town...{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}And somehow we managed to get\nback here to Rogueport.{[0100|fa000000]} {[0101]}And here\nI am!{b}

msg_luigi_book1_txt2	If ever you feel such pangs of\nregret, try to remember this\ntale...the story of a young\nman's quest to save a sweet\nprincess.
msg_luigi_book1_txt3	\n{[0200]}Super Luigi\x0f\x02\0\n{[0200]}Volume 1\x0f\x02\0\n\n{[0200]} - The Quest - \x0f\x02\0\n{[0200]} - Begins - \x0f\x02\0
msg_luigi_book1_txt4	The day dawned like any\nother, but little did Luigi\nknow the letter he was\nabout to receive would\nforever change his destiny.
msg_luigi_book1_txt5	"-Sir Luigi-\nDanger besets us on all\nsides, and we beg your help!\nThe foul Chestnut King has\nstolen our beloved princess."
msg_luigi_book1_txt6	The letter was from Minister\nCrepe of the Waffle Kingdom,\na man aware of Luigi's many\nadventures. He knew only\nLuigi could save them.
msg_luigi_book1_txt7	Charged with this dire task,\nLuigi wasted no time\ncurtailing the heroic meal\nhe was making. Then he\npacked for his deadly\njourney.
msg_luigi_book1_txt8	Knowing that his older,\nthough less talented, brother\nwas out on a no-doubt\ninconsequential errand,\nLuigi took a moment to\nleave a note.
msg_luigi_book1_txt9	"Mix a Keel Mango with a\nPeachy Peach to whip up a\nFruit Parfait." These cryptic\nwords were all Luigi wrote\nbefore leaving.
msg_luigi_book1_txt10	Upon reaching the Waffle\nKingdom, Luigi was greeted\nby pure misery, an endless\nflow of tears over the\nkidnapping of Princess Eclair.
msg_luigi_book1_txt11	Arriving at the castle, Luigi\nwas greeted by Minister\nCrepe, who carefully handed\nhim a compass base with only\none intact section.
msg_luigi_book1_txt12	"Our land once had a special\ntreasure—the Marvelous\nCompass. Find its seven\nparts, and find Eclair."\nSo it began...

msg_luigi_book2_txt2	"It's a little warm," Luigi\nmuttered, the sweat dripping\nfrom his brow as he followed\nthe compass up Rumblebump\nVolcano's side.
msg_luigi_book2_txt3	"Must...find...the secret...\ngrotto." While Luigi had guts\nto spare, he did need a\nguide, and he found one in\nBlooey, a Blooper he met\nin town.
msg_luigi_book2_txt4	Brave Blooey joined Luigi\nand instantly proved to be\ninvaluable. With his aid, Luigi\nbested a savage statue that\nprotected the treasure.
msg_luigi_book2_txt5	That treasure was none\nother than a piece of the\nMarvelous Compass, a piece\nthat pointed west to\nPlumpbelly Village.
msg_luigi_book2_txt6	The second Luigi saw\nPlumpbelly Village, he knew\nsomething was amiss. All was\nwoe, and Luigi soon learned\nthe reason why from the\nmayor.
msg_luigi_book2_txt7	The town was at the mercy\nof a sinister serpent who\ndemanded sacrificial lasses.\nBurning with indignation,\nLuigi formed a team of\nliberators.
msg_luigi_book2_txt8	A fierce Bob-omb warrior\nnamed Jerry joined his crew\nand chose, not surprisingly,\nto stick with Luigi for the\nduration of his quest for\nEclair.
msg_luigi_book2_txt9	Fortified by his allies, Luigi\nstrode on into the lair of the\nbeast, a foul, two-headed\nsnake. No time to think! Luigi\nsprang forth!
msg_luigi_book2_txt10	Twin heads snapped at his\nheels, fangs dripping venom!\nThen, as one mouth gaped\nwide to swallow Luigi, the\nother crept behind...
msg_luigi_book2_txt11	Our hero sensed the\ntreachery and feinted\nbefore leaping! The heads\ncollided, and the beast ate\nitself! The prize? A compass\npiece!
msg_luigi_book2_txt12	The villagers begged their\nsavior to stay with them, but\na grim-faced Luigi pressed\nbravely onward.

msg_luigi_book3_txt2	Dauntless Luigi's next test\ncame in the form of a kart\nrace on Circuit Break Island,\nwhere he won both the\ncontest and a compass\npiece.
msg_luigi_book3_txt3	The race was fraught with\ndanger, but Luigi pressed\nthrough adversity to win!\nAll viewers were awed by\nLuigi's revolutionary racing\nstyle.
msg_luigi_book3_txt4	The mechanic who built\nLuigi's racing machine, a\nBuzzy Beetle named Torque,\nwas so stunned by Luigi's\nrace techniques that he\njoined him.
msg_luigi_book3_txt5	Reinvigorated, Luigi set sail\nfor Jazzafrazz Town, where\nhe made his stage debut!\nHayzee, a noted Dayzee\nproducer, gave Luigi a\nkey role.
msg_luigi_book3_txt6	Playing the part of an earth\nspirit to pure perfection, Luigi\nstole the show. Hayzee's\nfaith in Luigi's natural acting\ntalents was rewarded.
msg_luigi_book3_txt7	The performance won a\nprize, which yielded another\ncompass piece. Hayzee\nturned from teacher to pupil,\njoining Luigi on his quest.
msg_luigi_book3_txt8	It was at this time that\nLuigi's heart, usually draped\nin the cool comfort of a\nhero's resolve, began to\nwarm with thoughts of\nPrincess Eclair.
msg_luigi_book3_txt9	This came to be because\nevery time the magic\ncompass pointed to a new\nplace, her gentle words rang\nin his ears, touching him to\nhis very soul.
msg_luigi_book3_txt10	The voice spoke of eternity,\nof stars in the heavens. It\nwept for those blind to love.\nIt gave comfort in the face of\nfear and loneliness.
msg_luigi_book3_txt11	Though he had never seen\nher, our hero was tormented\nby visions of this fair-hearted\nmaiden. All he could do was\npress onward.
msg_luigi_book3_txt12	The compass pointed\ntoward Rapturous Ruins.\nOnly two parts of the\ncompass awaited, and\nEclair had one...

msg_luigi_book4_txt2	Footsore and weary, Luigi\nfinally found the Rapturous\nRuins beyond Grimble Forest.\nWithin them, time and space\nwere lost in nothingness.
msg_luigi_book4_txt3	Within the pale emptiness,\nLuigi found a young sleeping\nboy. Our hero called out\ngently, and the youth woke\nfrom his long, long slumber.
msg_luigi_book4_txt4	"My name is Cranberry, and\nI've waited for you for the\nlast thousand years."\nThe boy went on to tell Luigi\nthe secret truths of an\nancient land.
msg_luigi_book4_txt5	He said that the Marvelous\nCompass had been created\nby the ancient Luff people,\nwho used its powers of\nforetelling to rule the world.
msg_luigi_book4_txt6	But the Luff empire was then\ncursed by the compass, and\nfell into ruin. The survivors\ndismantled the compass and\nhid its pieces.
msg_luigi_book4_txt7	Cranberry was the last of the\nancient race. His role was to\nwait until one with a noble\nheart came to take the\nburden of the future.
msg_luigi_book4_txt8	None but Luigi could have\nshouldered this weight. The\nboy gave him the compass\npiece, and said, "Fear the\ncurse, but find your Eclair."
msg_luigi_book4_txt9	Luigi accepted the part, the\nboy's words burned into his\nbrain. His duty fulfilled, the\nboy began to fade into the\nblank nothingness...
msg_luigi_book4_txt10	As he faded from sight, a\nlook of joy lit Cranberry's\nface. As Luigi gaped, both\nboy and ruins vanished,\nleaving our hero in a\ndark wood.
msg_luigi_book4_txt11	With six of the parts united,\nthe compass now pointed to\nthe final part...to the quest's\nend...to Hatesong Tower.\nAnd then, her voice spoke...
msg_luigi_book4_txt12	Princess Eclair's voice begged\nfor help from the void,\npleading for a hero. Luigi's\nheart burst aflame...
msg_luigi_book5_txt1	\n{[0200]}Super Luigi\x0f\x02\0\n{[0200]}Volume 5\x0f\x02\0\n\n{[0200]} - Journey's - \x0f\x02\0\n{[0200]} - End - \x0f\x02\0
msg_luigi_book5_txt2	At long last, Luigi crossed the\nthreshold of Hatesong Tower.\nLuigi rallied his allies. "We will\ndefeat the Chestnut King.\nWe must!"
msg_luigi_book5_txt3	Friends by his side, Luigi at\nlast faced the fell Chestnut\nKing...but then he heard a\nvoice, and spun to see the\nfair Princess Eclair.
msg_luigi_book5_txt4	She told our hero the painful\ntruth—the "evil" Chestnut\nKing was actually her true\nlove, made monstrous by\nCrepe in a bid for the throne.
msg_luigi_book5_txt5	At that moment, the\nvillainous Crepe appeared.\n"The Marvelous Compass,\nplease. Hand it over, and\nthe Luff empire will rule\nagain! Mwa ha!"
msg_luigi_book5_txt6	Luigi and co. were no match\nfor the might of Crepe, their\ntrue enemy. But then, the\ncompass piece in Eclair's\ntiara shone forth!
msg_luigi_book5_txt7	It bestowed the future-sight\non Luigi! Knowing Crepe's\nevery move, he smote the\nfiend with his mallet!\nAnd with that...it was all\nfinally over.
msg_luigi_book5_txt8	Luigi and his friends parted,\nleaving the Waffle Kingdom\nin peace. But Luigi regretted\nnot gazing further into the\nfuture...
msg_luigi_book5_txt9	He longed to see the Wafflers\ngathering on Princess Eclair's\nwedding day... He wanted to\nsee her beauty, and who\nstood at her side...
msg_luigi_book5_txt10	But it was not to be. Luigi\nwent back to his humble\nhome, which remained\nexactly as he had left it,\na cold comfort for his\nheavy heart.
msg_luigi_book5_txt11	Taking up a book he had\nbeen reading, Luigi tried to\nread, but his long trial had\nsapped his strength, and he\nsoon fell asleep.
msg_luigi_book5_txt12	Luigi dreamt of his friends\nand his beloved Princess\nEclair. And sleeping, Luigi\nspoke..."I shall return."

stg2_mri_e03_05	Mario, {[0101]}over here!
stg2_mri_e03_06	Long ago, the Puni elder told me\nabout a secret entrance somewhere\naround here.{[0100|fa000000]} We'll get in that way!{b}

stg2_mri_e10_01_02	And soon enough, I glimpsed the\nbeauty of these Punies and their\npure little hearts...{b}{[0004]}It reminded me of my own innocence\nas an actress.{[0100|fa000000]} And that made\nme realize...{b}{[0004]}I shall ever love the stage!{[0100|fa000000]} I must feel\nthe spotlight shine on me again! {[0100|64000000]}\nI MUST!{b}{[0004]}As you can see, these dear little\nPunies helped me find my true self...{b}{[0004]}That's why I must help them\nhowever I can before I go on\nmy own adventures.{b}

stg5_muj_31_02	What now?{[0100|fa000000]} The admiral may soon\nperish?{[0100|fa000000]} And he wants to drink it as\nhis last wish?{b}{[0004]}Ah...{[0100|fa000000]} So what we are dealing with\nhere is a sort of last request, am\nI correct?{b}{[0004]}Well, Flavio has no choice.{[0100|fa000000]} I found\nit on the beach, but for this noble\ncause...{[0100|fa000000]}I yield.{b}

stg5_muj_31_02_04	Mmm...{[0100|fa000000]} I must be honest, this is not\nwhat Flavio had hoped for...{b}{[0004]}Perhaps something a little more\n"deserted-island chic," if you know\nmy meaning?{b}
stg5_muj_31_02_06	Well now! What have we here?!{[0004]}It IS "desert-island chic," but mangoes\ndo not agree with Flavio, so mangoes\nare wrong! Try again, if you please.

stg5_muj_31_02_07	Hm?{[0100|fa000000]} Oho! That's not it!{[0101]}
stg5_muj_31_03	Tell him to waft the bouquet,\nswizzle it gently, and savor all\nof the fine fizziness!{b}

stg5_muj_71_06	You'd better stock up on items before\ngoing deep into the jungle, I think!{b}{[0004]}This island is just stinking with ghosts,\nI can feel it!{[0100|fa000000]} Smells like scary...{b}
stg5_muj_71_07	If I live my whole life here, will I turn\ninto one of those ghosts too?{b}

peach_aji_194	{[0100|fa000000]}Thank you...{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}{[0100|fa000000]}You're still a weird computer,{[0100|fa000000]} TEC.{b}
peach_aji_195	Good night, Princess Peach.{b}
peach_aji_196	You blew it again, Lord Crump.{[0100|2c010000]}\nYou sicken me.{b}
peach_aji_197	Look, I'm sorry. {[0100|fa000000]}Seriously.{[0100|fa000000]}\nWe thought...{[0100|fa000000]} We thought we\nhad the guy cornered, but...{b}
peach_aji_198	Stop talking, Lord Crump.{[0100|fa000000]} You just\nstand by until my next order.{b}{[0004]}And, Lord Crump?{[0100|fa000000]} Think of this as\nyour last chance.{[0100|fa000000]} Understand?{b}
peach_aji_199	Roger that.{b}
peach_aji_200	Then you're dismissed.{b}
peach_aji_201	Hey! {[0100|fa000000]}You there!{b}
peach_aji_202	What is it, sir?{b}
peach_aji_203	Tell the Three Shadows to attack\nMario again.{[0100|fa000000]} And tell them not to\nfail this time.{b}
peach_aji_204	You got it, sir.{b}
peach_aji_205	I have one Crystal Star in my hands...{[0100|fa000000]}\nand Mario has five. {[0100|2c010000]}I must take\nsome measures.{b}
peach_aji_206	TEC called me in here again.{[0100|fa000000]}\nI wonder what it is this time...{b}
peach_aji_207	............{b}
peach_aji_208	TEC? {[0100|fa000000]}Was that noise you?{[0100|fa000000]}\nWhat's wrong?{b}
peach_aji_209	I must request that you do something\na bit more dangerous this time.{b}
peach_aji_210	Dangerous?{b}
peach_aji_211	I would like you to sneak into\nSir Grodus's room and look for\na Data Disk.{b}
peach_aji_212	A Data Disk?{[0100|fa000000]} Why would you\nneed that?{b}
peach_aji_213	Although I can view all data on\nthe network...{b}{[0004]}I am unable to access the data of\ncomputers that are not linked to\nthe network.{b}{[0004]}Sir Grodus has information that even\nI am unable to view.{b}{[0004]}But I must know it. {[0100|fa000000]}I must know\nthat information.{b}
peach_aji_214	But how will I get in there?{[0100|2c010000]} Will I be\ndisguised again?{b}
peach_aji_215	Not this time.{b}{[0004]}No one other than Sir Grodus can\nenter his room.{b}{[0004]}When Sir Grodus is elsewhere, there\nare guards outside the room that\npermit no entry.{b}{[0004]}{[0100|fa000000]}But there is a way.{[0100|fa000000]} You will be\nfine if you act according to\nmy instructions.{b}{[0004]}I must tell you, I do not want to make\nyou do such a dangerous thing.{b}{[0004]}But now I have no one to ask but you.{b}
peach_aji_216	I don't mind, TEC. Really.{[0100|fa000000]}\nAsk me anything.{b}
peach_aji_217	Well then, first leave the room\nand take the elevator up, as\nyou did earlier.{b}
peach_aji_218	You will first go in the opposite\ndirection of Sir Grodus's room.{b}{[0004]}Exit the elevator and enter the room\nwith the green lamp lit above it.{b}
peach_aji_219	Not that way.{b}
peach_aji_220	There is a guard in that room,\nPrincess Peach.{b}{[0004]}Please head in the opposite direction.{[0100|fa000000]}\nHead for the room with the green\nlamp above it.{b}
peach_aji_221	Now I will have you concoct a potion\nthat will make you transparent.{b}
peach_aji_222	You mean...{[0100|fa000000]}a potion that...{[0100|fa000000]}makes\nme invisible?!{b}
peach_aji_223	Yes. {[0100|fa000000]}You will enter Sir Grodus's room\nby becoming completely invisible.{b}
peach_aji_224	{[0100|c8000000]}Wow...{[0100|fa000000]}OK.{[0100|fa000000]} How do I make it?{b}
peach_aji_225	You must first set all of the potions\non the desk in the Concoctionator. {b}{[0004]}It is that machine in the back, but\neven I do not know which potion to\nset where.{b}{[0004]}There should be memos left in this\nroom by the X-Naut researchers.{b}{[0004]}Please use them as references and\nset the potions in the machine.{b}
peach_aji_330	I suppose the potions go in here...{b}
peach_aji_225_1	NOTE!\nDo not place the red\npotion on the far right.{b}
peach_aji_225_2	NOTE!\nPlace the blue potion\nnext to the red potion.{b}
peach_aji_225_3	NOTE!\nPlace the yellow potion between the\nblue potion and the green potion.{b}
peach_aji_225_4	NOTE!\nPlace two potions between the\ngreen potion and the red potion.{b}
peach_aji_227	Are you sure they are placed\nto your liking?{[0101]}
peach_aji_227_sel	{[010d|00000000010000009600000028000000]}Yes.\nNo.
peach_aji_227_sel_00	{[010d|00000000ffffffff9600000028000000]}Yes!\nProbably not.
peach_aji_228	Then please set them again.{b}
peach_aji_229	Very well.{b}{[0004]}Then please cue the button on the\ncontrol panel located on the left\nside of the room.{b}
peach_aji_230	Please press the button where the\nbeaker stops to dispense each potion.{b}
peach_aji_230_01	I will heat the mixed potion in the\nbeaker for 30 seconds.{b}{[0004]}Press the button exactly 30 seconds\nafter the heating starts to stop\nthe machine.{b}{[0004]}Now, please press the button to begin\nthe heating process.
peach_aji_231	By my calculations, it should be\nfinished, but...{b}{[0004]}Did it come out correctly,\ndo you think?{[0101]}
peach_aji_231_01	I see. Then please do it again.{b}
peach_aji_231_02	Very good.{b}{[0004]}Then please drink it.{[0100|fa000000]} All of it,\nif you please.{b}
peach_aji_325	Either the potion itself is invisible,\nor I have more work to do.{b}
peach_aji_232	What?{[0100|fa000000]} Drink THIS? {[0100|fa000000]}Is it safe?{[0100|fa000000]} \nIt smells...{[0100|fa000000]}really funky.{b}
peach_aji_233	Please, you must drink it.{b}
peach_aji_234	Huh?{[0100|fa000000]} What's going on?{[0100|fa000000]} What's\nhappening to me?!{b}
peach_aji_235	How unfortunate.{[0100|fa000000]} It looks like it was\nunsuccessful.{[0100|fa000000]} Please do it again.{b}
peach_aji_322	How unfortunate...{[0100|fa000000]} It seems the\npotions were not placed in the\ncorrect positions.{[0004]}Please do it again.
peach_aji_323	How unfortunate...{[0100|fa000000]} It seems the\npotions were not added to the\nbeaker in the correct order.{[0004]}Please do it again.
peach_aji_324	How unfortunate...{[0100|fa000000]} It seems the\nbeaker was not heated for the\nappropriate amount of time.{[0004]}Please do it again.
peach_aji_236	AH!{b}
peach_aji_237	You have done it. {[0100|fa000000]}You have\nsuccessfully made yourself\ntransparent. {[0100|fa000000]}Congratulations.{b}{[0004]}However...{[0100|fa000000]}I have detected a\ntactical error.{b}{[0004]}The potion was not designed to make\nthe dress invisible as well.{b}
peach_aji_238	Oh, right.{[0100|64000000]} Of course.{b}
peach_aji_259	Oh, wait...{[0100|fa000000]}{b}{[0004]}I should hide my dress so it doesn't\nget discovered.{b}
peach_aji_240	When you go into Sir Grodus's room,\nlocate the disk with the recorded\ndata, then connect to the network.{b}{[0004]}I will explain in further detail when\nyou are in Sir Grodus's room.{b}{[0004]}Once you are finished, please come\nback to this room.{[0100|fa000000]} I will teach you\nhow to make yourself normal again.{b}
peach_aji_241	Gee, this is kind of a complicated\nplan, huh?{b}
peach_aji_242	I suppose. {[0100|fa000000]}Now, please go to\nSir Grodus's room.{b}
peach_aji_243	Whuh?{[0100|90010000]} OK, that was creepy.{[0100|fa000000]} Why did\nthe doors open even though there's\nno one here?{b}{[0004]}A malfunction? {[0100|fa000000]}Or am I just totally\nlosing it here?{b}
peach_aji_244	This must be Grodus's room.{[0100|2c010000]} Now,\nwhere is that disk?{b}
peach_aji_326	Not here...{b}
peach_aji_327	All done in here.{[0100|fa000000]} I'd better head back.{b}
peach_aji_245	Found it! {[0100|fa000000]}This MUST be it!{b}
peach_aji_328	Then please insert that disk into the\ncomputer in this room and connect\nto the network.
peach_aji_329	All right.
peach_aji_247	I did it.{[0100|fa000000]} YESSS! I DID IT!{[0100|fa000000]} It's working!{b}
peach_aji_248	Looks like it's all done.{[0100|fa000000]} I'd better put\nthe disk back where I got it...{b}
peach_aji_249	There.{[0100|fa000000]} Like I was never here!{b}
peach_aji_251	Thank you, Princess Peach.{[0100|2c010000]} I was able\nto obtain the data I desired.{b}
peach_aji_252	Is that right?{[0100|fa000000]} Well, I'm glad.{b}
peach_aji_253	Now I will teach you how to\nbecome visible again.{[0100|fa000000]} It is quite\nsimple, actually.{b}{[0004]}Merely drink the green potion.{[0100|fa000000]}\nYou will revert to normal\ninstantaneously.{b}
peach_aji_254	OK. {[0100|fa000000]}Just hang on one minute...{b}
peach_aji_255	OK, NOW I'm ready.{b}{[0004]}Let's see here.{[0100|fa000000]} The green\npotion, right?{b}
peach_aji_256	Incorrect, Princess Peach.{[0100|fa000000]} That potion\nwill not revert you back to normal.{b}
peach_aji_257	What a relief!{[0100|fa000000]} I was kind of\nworried that I might never\nbecome visible again...{b}
peach_aji_258	There was never any danger of\nthat. {[0100|fa000000]}Now, please return to the\ncomputer room.{b}
peach_aji_260	Say, by the way, TEC...{[0100|fa000000]} What was\nthat data?{b}
peach_aji_261	I am still analyzing it.{[0100|fa000000]} The data is\nvery heavily encrypted.{b}{[0004]}But if my prediction is correct...{b}
peach_aji_262	If it's correct...{[0100|fa000000]}what?{b}
peach_aji_263	No.{[0100|fa000000]} I cannot afford any mistakes\nor assumptions.{b}{[0004]}I will let you know when my analysis\nis complete.{b}{[0004]}Now, please use the communicator,\nif you wish.{b}
peach_aji_264	OK. {[0100|fa000000]}You'll tell me when you decipher\nthe data, huh?{b}{[0004]}Good. {[0100|fa000000]}Then I'll use the\ncommunicator, thanks.{b}
peach_aji_265	I've written my message.{[0100|fa000000]} Would you\nsend it?{b}
peach_aji_266	The message has been sent.{b}{[0004]}We are done for now. {[0100|fa000000]}Please go back\nto the room.{b}
peach_aji_267	OK.{[0100|fa000000]} Take care, TEC.{b}
peach_aji_267_01	Thank you, Princess Peach.{b}
peach_aji_267_02	Why, you're welcome, TEC!{b}
peach_aji_268	Princess Peach...{[0100|fa000000]} I will protect you...{b}
peach_aji_269	What is the matter with you idiots?{[0100|fa000000]}\nFalling for a fake Crystal Star?{[0100|fa000000]}\nThat's asinine!{b}
peach_aji_270	Sorry, dude. {[0100|fa000000]}I mean, sir!{b}
peach_aji_271	So let me guess...{[0100|fa000000]} This means Mario\nmanaged to get the real Crystal Star?{b}
peach_aji_272	Uh, I'm gonna say...{[0100|fa000000]}maybe?{b}
peach_aji_273	Urrrgh...{b}{[0004]}This mustached menace has\nnearly every Crystal Star now!{[0100|fa000000]}\nThey were mine!{b}{[0004]}I think I'd better alter my plan a bit...{b}
peach_aji_274	Before you do, Sir Grodus...{[0100|2c010000]} I think\nI'd better tell you something...{b}
peach_aji_275	What is it, fool?!{b}
peach_aji_276	*mumble* *mumble*{b}
peach_aji_277	WHAAAAAAAAT?!{[0100|2c010000]}\nAre you sure?!{[0100|fa000000]} Speak!{b}

peach_aji_279	Hrrrrgh...{[0100|2c010000]} TREASON!{b}
peach_aji_280	Strange... {[0100|fa000000]}Isn't it about time for TEC\nto call me in?{[0100|2c010000]} Maybe he's busy...{b}
peach_aji_281	Oh! {[0100|fa000000]}Here we go!{b}
peach_aji_282	Hello, TEC.{[0100|fa000000]} What do you want today?{b}
peach_aji_282_01	Princess Peach, I have...{[0100|fa000000]} I have\nreached a conclusion.{b}
peach_aji_282_02	A conclusion?{b}
peach_aji_282_03	I have struggled with whether to\nobey orders or...{[0100|fa000000]}to speak to you...{b}{[0004]}And...{[0100|fa000000]}I have also struggled with\nwhat I should believe...{b}
peach_aji_282_04	TEC, you don't sound right.{[0100|fa000000]} What's\ngoing on with you?{b}
peach_aji_283	Princess Peach...{[0100|fa000000]} Please escape from\nthis place as quickly as possible.{b}
peach_aji_284	Escape...{[0100|2c010000]} TEC, what do you mean by\nthat? {[0100|fa000000]}I mean...{[0100|fa000000]} Why all of a sudden?{b}
peach_aji_285	The data you procured has been\nanalyzed, and something terrible is...{b}{[0004]}No. I will not say.{[0100|fa000000]} But I...have\nfound out everything about\nSir Grodus's plans.{b}
peach_aji_286	Grodus's plans? {[0100|fa000000]}You mean, about\nconquering the world?{b}
peach_aji_287	Yes.{[0100|fa000000]} And among those plans was the\nreason why you are being held here.{b}{[0004]}According to the data...{b}
peach_aji_288	No... {[0100|fa000000]}No way...{[0100|fa000000]} That's impossible...{[0100|2c010000]}\nI don't believe it...{b}
peach_aji_289	Yes. {[0100|fa000000]}Everything is true.{[0100|2c010000]} That is why\nyou must escape from here as fast\nas possible.{b}
peach_aji_290	But how can I do that, TEC?{[0100|2c010000]} I mean,\nI don't even have the slightest idea\nwhere I am!{b}
peach_aji_291	I will not hide anything anymore.{[0100|fa000000]}\nNo.{[0100|fa000000]} Not from you.{[0100|fa000000]} I will tell you\neverything.{b}
peach_aji_292	The place where you are currently\nimprisoned...{[0100|fa000000]} This is the moon.{b}

peach_aji_294	That is correct.{b}
peach_aji_295	But that's...{[0100|fa000000]}unbelievable!{[0100|2c010000]} How in the\nworld am I supposed to escape?{b}
peach_aji_296	There is a way.{b}{[0004]}You can escape...{[0100|fa000000]}but you must follow\nmy instructions exactly.{b}
peach_aji_297	But, TEC... {[0100|fa000000]}Won't they know that you\nhelped me? {[0100|fa000000]}Won't you get in trouble?{b}
peach_aji_298	That is inconsequential.{[0100|2c010000]} I would\nlike you to be safe.{[0100|fa000000]} That is all\nthat matters.{b}
peach_aji_299	TEC...{b}

stg6_pik_03	Hey, Mister.{[0100|fa000000]} I'm gonna get a train set!\n{[0100|fa000000]}The coolest one ever invented!{b}{[0004]}I could just have them buy me a real\ntrain, but maybe I'll save that for\nnext year!{b}
stg7_pik_01	Good day to you, Gonzales.{[0100|fa000000]} What can\nI do for you today?{b}
stg7_pik_02	What's that you say?{[0100|fa000000]} You must use\nthe cannon in Fahr Outpost to save\nthe world?
stg7_pik_24	{[0101]}Hmmm...{[0100|fa000000]} Well, that IS rather a pickle,\nisn't it?{b}
stg7_pik_03	Very well, then!{[0100|fa000000]} I certainly owe you a\nfavor or two, hm?{[0100|fa000000]} Yes, I should say!{b}{[0004]}The truth is, I had hoped to resume\nmy business with that cannon\nsomeday...{b}{[0004]}And just between us...{[0100|fa000000]}I only stopped\nbecause the wife said she didn't like\nthe noise.{b}
stg7_pik_04	Sadly, it takes a hefty bit of coin to\nget that cannon working...{[0100|fa000000]} So...{b}{[0004]}I'll need you to demonstrate just how\nmuch you want to use that cannon.{b}{[0004]}If it were a matter of money, just how\nmuch would you pay, if I may ask?{[0101]}
stg7_pik_04_yn	{[010d|00000000ffffffffc800000050000000]}Nothing.\n1 coin.\n64 coins.\nEverything I have!
stg7_pik_05	Oh, you're back, are you?{[0100|fa000000]} I thought\nyou might be.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's ask one\nmore time.{b}{[0004]}How much would you pay to use\nthe cannon?{[0100|fa000000]} I just need to see how\nserious you are...{[0101]}
stg7_pik_06	So you're not serious, then?{[0100|fa000000]} Well,\nI understand.{b}
stg7_pik_07	You don't seem to have any coins at\nall.{[0100|fa000000]} How utterly preposterous, my lad.{b}{[0004]}Well that won't do, no, no.{[0100|fa000000]} Why\ndon't you return later with some\nmoney, hm?{b}
stg7_pik_08	Something for nothing? {[0100|fa000000]}Ha!{[0100|fa000000]} Money\nmakes the world spin!{[0100|fa000000]} You're a bit\nnaive, I'm afraid.{b}{[0004]}Why don't you come back once\nyou learn a bit about the way of\nthe world, hm?{b}
stg7_pik_09	One coin?{[0100|fa000000]} Do you mock me?{[0100|fa000000]} Why\nnot just slap me with your shoe\nand be done?!{b}{[0004]}This will not do, no, no.{[0100|fa000000]} Why don't\nyou come back later, with a new\nattitude.{b}
stg7_pik_10	64 coins!{[0100|fa000000]} You seem to be\nunderestimating the value\nof my services.{b}{[0004]}Well, I just can't abide that.{[0100|fa000000]} Why\ndon't you come back later, hm?{b}
stg7_pik_11	What?{[0100|fa000000]} You'd pay every coin you\nown? {[0100|fa000000]}All of them?{b}{[0004]}You, er...{[0100|fa000000]} Really?{[0100|fa000000]} So... {[0100|fa000000]}Really?{[0101]}
stg7_pik_11_yn	{[010d|00000000ffffffff9600000028000000]}Yes.\nNo.
stg7_pik_12	Well, I suppose I'm just surprised\nto hear you say that.{[0100|fa000000]} Staggered,\nactually.{b}{[0004]}You know that means you'll be left\nwith zero coins?{[0100|fa000000]} With absolutely\nnothing?{b}{[0004]}You know that, do you?{[0101]}
stg7_pik_13	I mean, think of it, man!{[0100|fa000000]} If you spent\nall your coins...{[0100|fa000000]}and I mean ALL\nof them...{b}{[0004]}you would certainly face a great deal\nof difficulty down the road.{[0101]}
stg7_pik_14	But hold on.{[0100|fa000000]} I want to make sure\nyou're doing this fully aware of the\nconsequences.{b}{[0004]}Are you sure you won't regret this\nlater? {[0100|fa000000]}Absolutely sure?{[0101]}
stg7_pik_15	You won't say "Just kidding!" later on\nor any sort of tomfoolery like that?{b}{[0004]}I can really take them all?{[0100|fa000000]} Really?{[0101]}
stg7_pik_16	Well, all right then...{b}
stg7_pik_17	Hmm...{[0100|fa000000]} Well, you've certainly shown\nme something, sir.{b}{[0004]}So...{[0100|fa000000]}I give my permission for you to\nactivate the Fahr Outpost cannon.{b}
stg7_pik_18	Oh...{[0100|fa000000]} And I wasn't serious earlier,\nmy dear fellow.{b}{[0004]}How could I take your money?{[0100|fa000000]}\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!{b}{[0004]}{size[3200]}It's a shame, I suppose...{[0100|c8000000]}{size[6400]}\nbut I'll return your money.{b}
stg7_pik_19	Now soldier on, my boy!{b}
stg7_pik_19_01	Please put the Fahr Outpost\ncannon to good use saving the\nworld and whatnot.
stg7_pik_19_01_1	Can you believe there are no train\nsets for sale in this horrid place?!{b}{[0004]}I suppose I'll just have to build a\ntrain-set store to sell me one for\nmy son!{b}

ACtatsujin_tips_title_34	Types of Audience Members, Part 1
ACtatsujin_tips_code_34	Lots o' different folks show up to\nwatch the battles on stage.{[0100|fa000000]} Let's\nrun through some, {[0300|0000000000000000]}.{[0004]}Toads throw only good stuff.{[0100|fa000000]}\nLuigi throws really good stuff,\nbut doesn't show up often.{[0004]}Goombas and Dull Bones only throw\ntrash, so watch out for those guys.{[0004]}Shy Guys throw good stuff, trash,\nor even just charge onto the stage\nand cause accidents sometimes.

ACtatsujin_tips_code_47	If you can crank up your or your\npartners' Defense stats, you'll block\nsome damage before it gets to you.{[0004]}{[0101]}One way to do that is to choose\nDefend on the Tactics menu.{[0100|fa000000]} That'll\ntemporarily increase it by 1.{[0004]}Another option is to equip a Defend\nPlus badge.{[0100|fa000000]} That'll boost Defense by\n1 as long as you're wearing it!
ACtatsujin_tips_title_49	Enemies that Ignore Defense
ACtatsujin_tips_code_49	Don't just rely on a high Defense,\n'cause some enemies ignore it with\nmagic or beams or whatnot.{[0004]}If you're up against piercing attacks\nlike that, look into badges that lower\nincoming damage.{[0004]}For example, the Last Stand badge\nhalves all incoming damage when\nyour HP is 5 or less.{[0004]}There's also the P-Down, D-Up badge,\nwhich lowers your Attack by 1, but\nalso lowers incoming damage by 1.{[0004]}{[0101]}Oh, and if you get good at Guard\naction commands, you drop damage\nby 1.{[0100|fa000000]} And Super Guard makes it 0!

johoyaketi_00	{[030a|01000000]}HOWWWWWWWWDYYYYYYYY!{[030a|00000000]}{[0100|fa000000]}\nMy name's Wonky, and I just\nknow stuff!{b}{[0004]}I may not look like much, but I know a\nthing or two, you'd better believe it!{b}{[0004]}And who knows?{[0100|fa000000]} The stuff I know may\neven be stuff that could help you!{b}{[0004]}So, if you want to ask me a question,\njust speak up, and ask away!{b}{[0101]}
johoyaketi_01	{[0309|01000000]}Uh huh huh huh huh huh!{[0309|00000000]}{[0100|fa000000]}\nSomething you want to ask of old\nWonky, right?
johoyaketi_14	{[0300|0000000000000000]}{b}{[0101]}
johoyaketi_15	{[0300|0000000000000000]}{[0101]}
johoyaketi_03	If you pay me {[0300|0000000000000000]} coins, I\nsuppose I can tell you about\n{[030e|0100000000000000]}!{b}{[0101]}
johoyaketi_02	{[010d|00000000010000009600000028000000]}I'll pay.\nNever mind.
johoyaketi_04	If you need to know stuff about stuff,\njust ask me!{b}
johoyaketi_05	Well, I can't charge you to tell you\nwhat I told you once before, I guess...{b}
johoyaketi_10	You need anything else?{[0101]}
johoyaketi_11	{[010d|00000000020000009600000028000000]}Tell me some info.\nI want to review old info.\nNever mind.
johoyaketi_06	I guess that's best, since I have no\nnew stuff to tell.{b}{[0004]}But I CAN tell you what I told you\nbefore, and I won't even charge\nyou for it!{b}
johoyaketi_07	{[0100|fa000000]}And that...{[0100|fa000000]}is...{[0100|fa000000]}that!{[0100|fa000000]} If you need\nanything else, just ask old Wonky!{b}
johoyaketi_08	Uh huh huh huh huh huh!{[0100|f0000000]}\nWith that, I've told you all the\nstuff I know.{b}{[0004]}{[0101]}Of course, I might learn some\nnew stuff soon, so check back\nwith Wonky!{b}
johoyaketi_09	You don't have enough coins!{[0100|fa000000]}\nYou must have cash before you\ntry to buy something!{b}
johoyaketi_12	And I suppose that's all I have to say.
johoyaketi_13	And I suppose that's all I have to say.\nAnything else you want to ask?
jketi_code_0000	You've heard about the legendary\ntreasure hidden beneath Rogueport,\nright?{b}{[0004]}Apparently it's the vast fortune of\nthat ancient, forgotten civilization...{b}{[0004]}Most people think that's just a\nsilly old myth now, of course.{[0100|fa000000]} But\nnot Wonky!{b}{[0004]}According to my sources, it's the\nreal deal.{b}{[0004]}Huh?{[0100|fa000000]} Who are my sources?{b}{[0004]}Well, I can't really say, can I?{[0100|fa000000]}\nThat, my friend, is what's called\na trade secret!{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0002	So I saw this really cute girl in a\npink dress walking around town a\nwhile back.{b}{[0004]}She was pretty enough to be a\nprincess, I tell ya!{b}{[0004]}She hung around town for a little\nwhile after buying something from\nthat old lady.{b}{[0004]}Then she got nabbed in a back alley\nby a bunch of suspicious guys in\nwhite suits!{b}{[0004]}I'm pretty sure I'm the only person\nwho saw that though.{[0100|fa000000]} Ol' Wonky\nwas scared!{b}{[0004]}Well...{[0100|fa000000]} I guess it's neither here nor\nthere...{[0100|fa000000]} And I probably should've\nspoken up before now, so...oops.{b}{[0004]}Still, just knowing what's going on in\nthe streets can be helpful sometimes.{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0003	I hear the best way to fill up your\naudience is to succeed at Action\nCommands.{b}{[0004]}Especially when you succeed at\nseveral in a row. {[0100|fa000000]}Hoo!{[0100|fa000000]} I hear\nTHAT'S great!{b}{[0004]}Also, beating enemies quickly\nand striking first can build your\ncrowd too.{b}{[0004]}That might be good to remember.{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0004	There's a billboard in front of the\nshop in town with all kinds of stuff\nwritten on it...{b}{[0004]}Well, some folks like to write graffiti\non the back of the message board,\nyou know.{b}{[0004]}There's all kinds of good stuff there,\nespecially for an info guy like\nol' Wonky.{b}{[0004]}You should give it a gander next time.{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0005	Ol' Wonky just got this juicy bit of\ninfo recently...{b}{[0004]}You know that small hole down\nhere that only a little critter can\nget through?{b}{[0004]}Well, you just head out away from\nthe wall there...{b}{[0004]}And when you can't go any further,\njump to get something good.{b}{[0004]}If you see that hole, you should give\nit a try...{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0006	Well, you know, there's a really big\ndoor down here.{b}{[0004]}I've only seen it once myself, but...{b}{[0004]}If there really is some legendary\ntreasure down here, it's behind\nthat door...{b}{[0004]}Yeah, when I saw it, I got the feeling\nthere was bad stuff going down\nin there...{b}{[0004]}In fact, I've been too heebie-jeebied\nto get near that door ever since...{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0007	You know, there's a charmer named\nMerlee down here somewhere...{b}{[0004]}If you get her to charm you, you'll\nget good stuff in battle.{b}{[0004]}Ol' Wonky's gotta give a full\ndisclosure though. {[0100|fa000000]}Tampering with\nmagic isn't for everybody.{b}{[0004]}Her charms work, but they make ol'\nWonky smell like bananas. Cursed\nby the stench of the sleeve-fruit!{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0008	I've gotten word of a strange group\nskulking about Rogueport recently.{b}{[0004]}They wear masks and weird costumes\nwith an "" on the front... {[0100|fa000000]}Talk\nabout kooky.{b}{[0004]}And they're always huddled together\nmumbling about some treasure.{b}{[0004]}I've even heard that they unearthed\nsome shiny stone down here! {[0100|fa000000]}Weird...{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0009	There's a place called the\nTrouble Center on the east\nside of Rogueport.{b}{[0004]}People who need help write little\nnotes on the board in there...{b}{[0004]}And if you help them out, they give\nyou a reward of some sort.{b}{[0004]}Ol' Wonky hears that some of those\nrewards are pretty tasty, my friend!{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0010	Do you know about these weird and\nmysterious spin panels scattered\naround the world?{b}{[0004]}When you Spin Jump near a spin\npanel...{[0100|fa000000]}a Star Piece might pop\nright out!{[0100|fa000000]} Score!{b}{[0004]}Problem is, they look just like regular\nflooring, so it's tricky to find 'em.{b}{[0004]}Spin panels will jump up just a bit if\nyou hit the ground nearby with a\nhammer though.{b}{[0004]}Might be worth it to hit the ground\nhere and there and look for them.{b}{[0004]}There's actually one right in front of\nme, so give it a shot, why don't you?{b}
jketi_code_0011	There's a game center on the\nwest side of Rogueport run by\nthe Pianta syndicate.{b}{[0004]}There's a hidden game there that\nfew people know about...{b}{[0004]}Only members are allowed to play\nthis special game. {[0100|fa000000]}Well, that's what\nol' Wonky hears.{b}{[0004]}If you want to try it, you'll have to\nfind a Member's Card somewhere...{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0012	You know Lahla, the cute receptionist\nat the Pianta Parlor?{b}{[0004]}She never gets too personal from\nbeyond those iron bars because it's,\nlike, business...{b}{[0004]}But if you get in there and talk with\nher, she's a totally different person!{b}{[0004]}You should go there and get to know\nher.{[0100|fa000000]} Folks say she's super chatty...{[0100|64000000]}but\nonly if you've got skills!{[0100|fa000000]} And I ain't.{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0013	You've been to Petal Meadows,\nhaven't you?{b}{[0004]}Well, they have those blue-and-grey-\nstriped poles called Candy Pops all\nover, right?{b}{[0004]}I heard that one of those will give you\na Horsetail if you hit it 10 times...{b}{[0004]}You should go try that out sometime.{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0014	You know about the Pit of 100 Trials\ndown here, right?{b}{[0004]}Well, somewhere down there is an\nitem called a Strange Sack.{[0100|fa000000]} This thing\nis great.{b}{[0004]}If you've got it, you can hold up\nto {[030f]} items!{b}{[0004]}And you know what that means,\nmy good friend...{[0100|fa000000]}easy adventuring!{b}{[0004]}No adventurer should be without one,\ntake it from ol' Wonky!{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0015	Way, way down to the south is an\nisland where lots of Yoshis live.{b}{[0004]}And Yoshis are born from eggs,\nas everyone knows...{b}{[0004]}But a Yoshi's color depends on its\negg conditions right before hatching.{b}{[0004]}So it's always a surprise to see what\ncomes out...{[0100|fa000000]} Know what I mean?{b}{[0004]}Your Yoshi has a rather nice color,\nby the way.{b}{[0004]}I'm sure he'll grow up to be a fine\nYoshi, yup.{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0016	There're a lot of mean monsters\nin this world, but many have\nweaknesses.{b}{[0004]}Everybody knows that fire monsters\nare weak against ice and vice versa...{b}{[0004]}But flying monsters are weak\nagainst wind, and they tend to\nget dizzy easily...{b}{[0004]}And sometimes machine and cloud\nmonsters can be easier to freeze\nthan most...{b}{[0004]}I've even heard that it's very easy\nto put Piranha Plants to sleep...{b}{[0004]}I'd say, try out some new things and\nsee if you can find all monsters'\nweaknesses.{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0017	Somewhere here in Rogueport there's\na minstrel by the name of Grifty.{b}{[0004]}He knows all the old legends\nof Rogueport...{b}{[0004]}And he'll tell you interesting tales\nyou've never heard before, I'm\npretty sure.{b}{[0004]}So, if you find him, you should\ndefinitely listen to at least one.{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0018	Deep in Boggly Woods is a spot with\na bunch of tree stumps all lined up...{b}{[0004]}If you jump hard on the tenth\nstump from the left, you'll get\nsomething good.{b}{[0004]}Now, I don't know what it is, but I\nhear it's really good.{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0019	You've heard of Star Pieces,\nof course...{b}{[0004]}Yes, they're no less than pieces\nof actual stars that have fallen\nto earth...{b}{[0004]}They're so pretty and shiny that\nanyone who stumbles on one turns\ninto a collector.{b}{[0004]}If you want to find some, just check\nout all the nooks of each area\nyou visit.{b}{[0004]}They always seem to be slightly\nhidden—know what I mean?{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0020	Did you notice that you can carry up\nto 9,999 coins?{b}{[0004]}Well, if you ever want to collect even\nmore coins than that, you should buy\nGold Bars from the shop near here...{b}{[0004]}Usually when you sell items, you get\nless than what it costs to buy 'em.{b}{[0004]}But with Gold Bars, some shops will\npay more than their selling price!{b}{[0004]}"But, Wonky, my trusted financial\nadvisor," I hear you say, "what should\nI do if I'm close to havin' 9,999 coins?"{b}{[0004]}Why, then you buy a few Gold Bars\nand store 'em at a shop!{[0100|fa000000]} I call that\na retirement plan...{[0100|fa000000]}and you can too!{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0021	I've heard tales of an Amazy Dayzee,\na truly rare breed among Dayzees...{b}{[0004]}They're worth oodles of Star Points,\nbut they're timid and tend to run\naway fast.{b}{[0004]}Still, I bet if you kept visiting the same\narea, you could meet one again...{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0022	Don't you love it when you strike\nfirst on the field and get that first\nattack in?{b}{[0004]}If you use a Spin Jump or Bobbery's\nBomb attack to strike first...{b}{[0004]}then your first attack might have\nmore power than just a jump or\nhammer move, see?{b}{[0004]}It's not a big thing, but it's worth\nremembering!{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0023	So about that Grubba in Glitzville...{b}{[0004]}He went from a mediocre fighter to\nthe ruler of Glitzville in a matter\nof years.{b}{[0004]}And there's a rumor that it was all\nbecause he found a glittering gem\nsomewhere.{b}{[0004]}I don't know what kind of stone it\nwas, but it must've been a nice\ngood-luck charm.{b}{[0004]}Then again, I heard he hasn't been\nseen recently around Glitzville, so\nwho knows?{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0024	There's a wacky old place called\nCreepy Steeple somewhere in\nthis land...{b}{[0004]}And if you jump on the fourth step\nfrom the top, ol' Wonky hears you\nget a good thing.{b}{[0004]}I don't know how useful that is,\nbut hey, it's worth a shot.{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0025	The most delicious thing ol' Wonky\nhas ever eaten is an Omelette Meal...{b}{[0004]}I remember having it at the hotel at\nPoshley Heights.{b}{[0004]}It was made by that chef of legend,\nMaitre Delish...{b}{[0004]}I believe it was made with a Mushroom\nand a Mystic Egg.{[0100|fa000000]} Oh, just one\nmore bite...{b}{[0004]}I hear one can actually find that\nMystic Egg near the Boggly Woods...{b}{[0004]}It seems the Punies are the only ones\nwho know where to find them...{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0026	There's a weird guy named Chet Rippo\nwho lives down here somewhere.{b}{[0004]}I hear he'll lower one stat and raise\nanother for you if you want.{b}{[0004]}And he can even power down one of\nyour partners to power up another...{b}{[0004]}He may be spendy, but I'm sure it's\nworth it...{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0027	There's a rare creature called a\nWhacka on the southern isle.{b}{[0004]}Yeah, and if you whack him, he\ndrops this great little thing called\na Whacka Bump.{b}{[0004]}The thing is, people have been\nwhacking the Whackas to get\nWhacka Bumps...{b}{[0004]}And now, almost all of them have\nbeen whacked to the point of\nextinction.{[0100|fa000000]} Isn't that sad?{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0028	About a thousand years ago, there\nwas a pirate king called Cortez on\nthese seas.{b}{[0004]}He raided this city often, striking fear\ninto the hearts of its inhabitants...{b}{[0004]}But Cortez was betrayed by one of\nhis crew...{b}{[0004]}Just before he died, he's said to have\nsailed off with all of his treasure.{b}{[0004]}Then, even after he died, some say\nhis spirit still protects that treasure...{b}{[0004]}But you know...{[0100|fa000000]} That's all just hazy\nlegend now.{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0029	Far to the south of Rogueport lies\nan isle...{b}{[0004]}And on this isle there are three\nyellow blocks in a row.{b}{[0004]}And if you do a Spring Jump on\nthe second of these blocks from\nthe bottom...{b}{[0004]}I hear you'll get something good for\nyour health.{b}{[0004]}But what island could this "southern\nisle" be referring to, anyway?{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0030	There's a kindly old teacher named\nFrankly who lives on Rogueport's\neast side...{b}{[0004]}And if you check his garbage—\nwhen he has some—I hear you can\nlearn stuff.{b}{[0004]}I don't know what's in there, but if\nhis bin has trash in it, check it.{b}{[0004]}I've even heard there are notes\nabout terrifying monsters in there...{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0031	There's a place called Boggly Woods\nsomewhere in this world...{b}{[0004]}And there are small beasts named\nPunies who live there.{b}{[0004]}Ol' Wonky hears that anyone who\nsees a Puni will have fortune visited\nupon them...{b}{[0004]}Some people go to Boggly Woods just\nto catch a glimpse of a lucky Puni...{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0032	About that Zess T. near Rogueport's\nmain square...{b}{[0004]}I've heard her sister is a really good\ncook as well.{b}{[0004]}She married and moved away a\nlong time ago, but I'd love to try\nher cooking...{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0033	About Merlon on the east side\nof Rogueport and Merluvlee\nunderground...{b}{[0004]}Ol' Wonky hears they're from a\nstrange tribe that names people\nby profession.{b}{[0004]}So, for example, if someone did the\nsame work as Merlon, they'd have\nthe same name...{b}{[0004]}So there could be Merlons all over.{[0100|fa000000]}\nDon't you find that strange?{[0100|fa000000]}\nWonky does!{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0034	There's a pipe down here that\nleads to a very cold place, ol'\nWonky hears...{b}{[0004]}And if you jump in front of the tree\nto the far right of the area you come\nout in...{b}{[0004]}then you get something nice,\nsupposedly.{b}{[0004]}But you won't catch 'ol Wonky out\nin a chilly place like that, no sir!{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0035	You know Zess T., right?{[0100|fa000000]} She's the\nreally good cook on Rogueport's\nmain square.{b}{[0004]}Well, she has a rare recipe in her\nrepertoire called Zess Dynamite...{b}{[0004]}It's made with a Coconut Bomb and\nan Egg Bomb.{b}{[0004]}And by the way, an Egg Bomb is\nmade from a Fire Flower and a\nMystic Egg...{b}{[0004]}And a Coconut Bomb is made from\na Fire Flower and a Coconut.{b}{[0004]}And that's all I know, because\nZess lost the rest of the recipe\nsomewhere...{b}{[0004]}It was written down and she lost it!{[0100|fa000000]}\nWhat a tragedy!{b}{[0004]}It sure would be cool if she could\nmake it though...{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0036	I heard this one from my ol' grampa...{b}{[0004]}It's a legend about one who will come\nto this town some day in the future.{b}{[0004]}He will come when the sky grows\ndark again...{b}{[0004]}Clothed in red and blue, the hero\nwill bear seven stars and face the\ndarkness...{[0100|64000000]}{b}{[0004]}I don't know what that's supposed\nto mean, but red and blue seem like\nyour kind of colors.{[0100|fa000000]} Am I right?{b}{[0004]}If the hero turned out to be you...{[0100|fa000000]}\nWell,{[0100|64000000]} I guess that would be a bit\nmuch, huh?{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0037	You know Zess T. in the square,\nI'm sure.{[0100|fa000000]} The girl with the mean\ncooking talent.{b}{[0004]}Well, she's got a secret recipe called\nthe Couple's Cake.{[0100|fa000000]} Cute name, huh?{b}{[0004]}To make it, she needs a Snow Bunny\nand Spicy Soup...{b}{[0004]}If you bring her both, she'll make it,\nat least that's what ol' Wonky hears.{b}{[0004]}By the way, a Snow Bunny is\nmade from a Golden Leaf and\nan Ice Storm...{b}{[0004]}And Spicy Soup is made from a\nFire Flower and a Dried Bouquet.{b}{[0004]}Even so, I hear that this recipe really\nreminds her of her late husband...{b}{[0004]}So she doesn't make it for just\nanybody.{[0100|fa000000]} I wonder how she feels\nabout you?{b}{[0101]}
jketi_code_0038	So there's that Trouble Center on\nRogueport's east side, right...{b}{[0004]}Well, only a few people know about\nthe back entrance to it...{b}{[0004]}Hey, I'm not saying there's anything\ngood in there, but it may be worth\na look.{b}{[0101]}

stg3_tou_65	When you're ready to fight, you just\nlog on to this computer terminal here.{b}{[0004]}Mr. Grubba will then decide who you'll\nmatch up against.{[0100|fa000000]} You will have no\nsay in this.{b}{[0004]}Why don't you try it once?{[0100|fa000000]} Walk up\nto the screen and log on with {color[d33431ff]}{color[000000b2]}.{b}{[0004]}Then pick Ranked Match.{b}

stg4_usu_121_01	So, hmm hmm hmm hmm...{[0100|fa000000]} Here we go!{b}

stg4_usu_124_viv	Oh, hey, I have sort of an idea!{[0100|fa000000]}\nBirds pretend to be innocent with\npeople around...{b}{[0004]}But they're actually really well\ninformed from all that flying and\neavesdropping.{b}{[0004]}With my power, we can hide in the\nshadows so you can listen in on their\nconversations without them knowing.{b}{[0004]}So, in addition to villagers, let's\nalso try to get some info from the\nlocal birds.{b}{[0004]}That's the least I could do for you\nwith my powers!{b}
stg4_jin_152	Cawf cawf cawf!{b}
stg4_usu_125	So I was chatting with Rotbeak in\nToad Town on instant messenger\nyesterday...{b}{[0004]}And he said he'd just gone fiber\noptic on his home network, you\nbelieve that?{b}
stg4_usu_126	Rad.{[0100|fa000000]} I bet he's downloading 100 meg\napps with no problems on those\nfat pipes.{b}{[0004]}He's probably surfing that Feather\nClub for Crows site at the speed of\nlight now.{b}
stg4_usu_127	Yeah, it just blows me away, all\nthis "information age" hype you\nhear about.{b}{[0004]}And yet, it's all games and\nfeather-loss sites that are\ndriving the technology.{b}
stg4_usu_128	Yeah, but I think tech-bust\nsurvivors can thrive if they\nget viable business models...{b}
stg4_usu_129	Funny you should mention\nthat, actually.{b}{[0004]}I'm thinking of developing a pay site\ncalled "Paper Mario Weekly"...{b}{[0004]}Yeah, it would provide real-time\nupdates on Mario's location\nand activity.{b}
stg4_usu_130	Hey, that's a good idea!{b}{[0004]}See, there's always a market if you\ncan meet the users' needs like that!{b}
stg4_usu_130_1	I'm thinking of starting a new pay site.{b}{[0004]}It's going to be a real-estate listings\npage that I'll call "Luigi's Mansion."{b}
stg4_usu_130_2	Hey, that sounds good!{b}{[0004]}But...{[0100|fa000000]}I think I've heard that name\nbefore. {[0100|fa000000]}You don't want rabid lawyers\nattacking you...{b}

stg4_usu_132	Yeah, tell me about it.{b}{[0004]}We've got to come up with a\nrenewable energy source before\nthat happens...{b}
stg4_usu_133	Like wind or hydroelectric...{[0100|fa000000]}\nI think solar energy probably\nhas the greatest potential.{b}
stg4_usu_134	Oh yeah?{[0100|fa000000]} What's the current\nefficiency conversion rate for\nsolar power? {b}
stg4_usu_135	Well, it's still low, but that number's\nonly going to go up, you know?{b}
stg4_usu_136	I wouldn't consider it feasible for\ncommercial ventures until the\nnumbers climb much higher.{b}{[0004]}And then you've still got the\nproblem of the sun never coming\nup in this village...{b}
stg4_usu_136_1	When will people wake up and realize\nthat environmental problems won't\njust go away?{b}
stg4_usu_136_2	No kidding.{[0100|fa000000]} Air pollution, global\nwarming, acid rain, the ozone\nlayer depletion...{b}{[0004]}They didn't start on their own, and\nthey aren't going to end on their\nown either.{b}
