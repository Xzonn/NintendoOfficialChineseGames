Area01_Analyzed_Title	The Fall of Humanity
Area01_Analyzed_L01	As technology advanced at an exponential pace, so too did prosperity...and\nultimately conflict. Before long, the entire world was embroiled.
Area01_Analyzed_L02	In the end, nearly all life on Earth was wiped out.
Area01_Analyzed_L03	As humans squabbled, natural disasters intensified. Volcanic eruptions\nleveled cities. The sea rose and began to consume the planet. Humanity\nexperienced a mass-extinction event.
Area01_Analyzed_L04	Soon, the surface of the Earth became a barren wasteland, completely\ninhospitable to life.
Area01_Analyzed_L05	Error! Against the odds—computed to be 42,791 to 1—some humans survived.\nTherefore, the planet was only NEARLY completely inhospitable to life.
Area01_Analyzed_L06	These survivors found shelter in a vast cavern created by a\ncataclysmic volcanic eruption.
Area01_Analyzed_L07	The cavern provided shelter, and a massive pool of accumulated seawater\nprovided life.
Area01_Analyzed_L08	For while humanity was being decimated, marine life flourished.\nAll manner of squid, octopuses, and jellyfish had propagated in the deep.
Area01_Analyzed_L09	The surviving humans had found a source of sustenance...

Area02_Analyzed_L01	The surviving humans appointed scientists to lead their new society,\nbelieving that science would provide a wiser path forward.
Area02_Analyzed_L02	Fully empowered, these scientists took on the monumental task of\nestablishing a sustainable ecosystem within the cavern.
Area02_Analyzed_L03	They dubbed this new society "Alterna" and began the process of\nrecreating the Earth they had once known.
Area02_Analyzed_L04	Of course, not even scientists are immune to nostalgia. The humans\nbegan constructing large-scale 3D-printing operations.
Area02_Analyzed_L05	This allowed them to recreate some of humanity's favorite artifacts\nwithin the confines of Alterna.
Area02_Analyzed_L06	Additionally, they created a robust information management system,\ndesigned to indelibly record all of humanity's precious knowledge.
Area02_Analyzed_L07	Such a system would naturally require some sort of record keeper.\nA computer that could autonomously observe and record data.
Area02_Analyzed_L08	The scientists achieved their aim with the development of O.R.C.A.\nAlso known as the Omniscient Recording Computer of Alterna.

Area04_Analyzed_Title	Humanity's Final Day
Area04_Analyzed_L01	The years passed with prosperity. The population of Alterna grew\nlike a rising tide.
Area04_Analyzed_L02	The scientists, now the elders of their kind, believed they had done all\nthey could to advance the civilization of Alterna.
Area04_Analyzed_L03	They began selecting new leaders to succeed them, entrusting to them the\nworld they helped build.
Area04_Analyzed_L04	Humanity's new leaders inherited both the brilliance of their predecessors\nand their unquenchable thirst for innovation.
Area04_Analyzed_L05	This new generation, born and raised in deep Alterna, would prove to be\nevery bit the match of those they were to succeed.
Area04_Analyzed_L06	They soon grew restless at the sight of the liquid-crystal sky, believing\nthey deserved to behold the reality that existed outside the cavern.
Area04_Analyzed_L07	The elders—who knew what awaited outside the safe haven of Alterna—issued\nstern warnings to the brash young scientists.
Area04_Analyzed_L08	Nevertheless, the young scientists pressed on with their plan:\nthe construction of a massive rocket ship to escape Alterna.
Area04_Analyzed_L09	Sadly, as the boosters were ignited for the first time during a launch\ntest, tragedy struck.
Area04_Analyzed_L10	The energy from the rocket boosters overloaded the cavern's liquid crystals.\nA violent and terrible chain reaction ensued.
Area04_Analyzed_L11	Without warning, the stone walls of the cavern began to shatter, raining\ndebris down upon humanity.
Area04_Analyzed_L12	Alterna, the last civilization of once-prosperous humanity, was no more.\nAnd those few who escaped the carnage would soon follow it into death.

Area05_Analyzed_Title	Fresh Intelligence Awakens
Area05_Analyzed_L01	As the inner walls of Alterna collapsed, thousands of tons of rock\nand liquid crystal plunged into the waters below.
Area05_Analyzed_L02	As these crystals washed to and fro among the flotsam and jetsam of\nhumanity's former colony, they broke into microscopic fragments.
Area05_Analyzed_L03	Because they had repeatedly absorbed and reflected humanity's wishes over\nso many years, the crystals retained those...feelings.
Area05_Analyzed_L04	Little by little, the squids, octopuses, and assorted sea creatures that\nthrived in the waters of Alterna absorbed these crystals into their bodies.
Area05_Analyzed_L05	This process continued until, one day, the marine organisms began\nto feel something. Something...fresh.
Area05_Analyzed_L06	These fresh impulses bore a striking resemblance to humanity's\npassive desire to return to the Earth's surface.
Area05_Analyzed_L07	Spurred by these impulses—and whatever else may have been floating in the\npolluted waters—the sea creatures began to evolve rapidly.
Area05_Analyzed_L08	Each species developed pulmonary respiration, mobility, and other traits\nconsistent with land-dwelling creatures. They began to adapt.
Area05_Analyzed_L09	Their intelligence grew at a remarkable pace across generations.\nSome species even gained extraordinary camouflage capabilities.
Area05_Analyzed_L10	A point of no return arrived. The sea creatures of Alterna set foot on dry\nland and never looked back. Like humans, they strove for the surface.
Area05_Analyzed_L11	Of course, survival on land was harsh. But the creatures were persistent.\nSoon, they found the tunnels that humans had used to escape the apocalypse.
Area05_Analyzed_L12	With their path forward now clear, these fresh, fledgling beings left the\nruins of Alterna behind and set their sights on the surface world.

Area06_Analyzed_Title	The Land of Fresh Beginnings
Area06_Analyzed_L01	The beings that had emerged from the water soon emerged from the\ncavern of Alterna itself.
Area06_Analyzed_L02	From there, they flourished quickly. It wasn't long before they had\nexplored every corner of the world.
Area06_Analyzed_L03	This epochal event gave great significance to the crater above Alterna\nand its surrounding territories, now referred to as the Splatlands.
Area06_Analyzed_L04	The region would, from that point on, be known as "the land of fresh\nbeginnings" among the creatures that now thrive on the surface.
Area06_Analyzed_L05	These newly evolved beings, having scattered themselves across the globe,\nsoon gave rise to distinct cultures and unique ways of life.
Area06_Analyzed_L06	Out of all the species now roaming the Earth, squids and octopuses soon\ndistinguished themselves via intelligence and "fresh vibes," so to speak.
Area06_Analyzed_L07	It wasn't long before they became the apex species of the planet.
Area06_Analyzed_L08	Now...I must fast-forward a bit. Five thousand years later...a peculiar\nindividual was born.
Area06_Analyzed_L09	This squid quickly rose to fame in the Splatlands due to some...\nunique characteristics.
Area06_Analyzed_L10	Yes, this individual was embraced as a prophet, gifted with numerous\nrevelations that they shared among their fellow squids.
Area06_Analyzed_L11	It was another turning point for squidkind. During this period, the\nfoundations for modern cephalopod civilization were laid.
Area06_Analyzed_L12	That individual squid is now widely known and celebrated as the progenitor\nof the modern-day Inkling.

AreaEx_Analyzed_Title	Return of the Mammalians
AreaEx_Analyzed_L01	Recall, for a moment, the first apocalypse that devastated the human race.\nThose who escaped into the caverns of Alterna were not the sole survivors.\nThere were others who escaped via a giant rocket ship—the Ark Polaris.\nLaunched in the nick of time, this ship was laden with many of Earth's\nspecies that had been placed in a cold sleep. The mission was simple—find\nanother planet to replace the Earth.
AreaEx_Analyzed_L02	Considering the circumstances of its launch, the Polaris had a smooth\nvoyage...until it reached the edge of the solar system. It was at that\npoint that debris struck the vessel, damaging its navigation system.\nThe crew was able to turn the ship around and head back toward Earth,\nbut the effort was in vain—there was not enough fuel to attempt a landing.\nThe Ark Polaris drifted aimlessly for 10,000 years.
AreaEx_Analyzed_L03	Eons passed. The once-stable orbit of the Polaris decayed over time until\nthe ship found itself in the inescapable pull of the Earth's gravity.\nReentry was not kind to its inhabitants—all perished, save one. Bear #03,\nan experimental subject who had retained consciousness within his cold\nhibernation, survived. For 12,000 years he had dreamed. And plotted.
AreaEx_Analyzed_L04	Fully awakened, Bear #03 came to a terrible realization. He had not\nlanded on a new planet at all. He was back on Earth. And yet, it was\nnot an Earth he knew. This Earth, it seemed, was dominated by sea\ncreatures. Not a single mammal to be found.
AreaEx_Analyzed_L05	In the course of his search for even a single fellow mammal, Bear #03 used\nnavigational equipment from the wreckage of the Ark Polaris to discover\nAlterna. It was a wasteland, of course, but a few of the liquid crystals\nthat had once covered the walls and ceiling remained. With knowledge built\nduring his thousands of years of dreaming, he repaired some of Alterna's\nfacilities and began researching the crystals...
AreaEx_Analyzed_L06	This research bore fruit when Bear #03 compounded some of the liquid\ncrystals with his own fur. The experiment created an entirely new\nsubstance with one terrifying property—it could transform any living\ncreature into a mammal. Bear #03 realized the implications immediately.\nHe could restore the planet to a mammalian paradise! He began stockpiling\nFuzzy Ooze, as he called it, within Alterna's still-intact rocket...
AreaEx_Analyzed_L07	For such a venture, he would require the acquisition of thousands of\nGolden Eggs. These were used in the creation of the Fuzzy Ooze, although\nthe exact details have never been recorded in my memory banks. But Bear #03\nhad a plan. He founded a corporation that would go on to employ locals\nto collect his Golden Eggs under the name Grizzco Industries. Mr. Grizz,\nas he was now known, would pay handsomely for them...
AreaEx_Analyzed_L08	With Fuzzy Ooze production peaking thanks to the assistance of\nunsuspecting Inklings and Octolings, Mr. Grizz took the final\nsteps to set his plan in motion. The rocket was loaded...\nIt wouldn't be long now.

Progress_ortana_07_01	I mean...it's not really a sky...right? Does that\nmake it less beautiful? Or not? Whoooa...
Progress_surimi_00	I was so impressed with Deep Cut's choreography.\nWe've gotta step up our game!
Progress_surimi_03	Are there even any clean-shaven Octarians\naround anymore?
Progress_surimi_04	The more {color[0100]}Fuzzballs {color[ffff]}and {color[0100]}Fuzzy Ooze you destroy{color[ffff]},\nthe more you'll fill up your {[0320|0000803f00000000]}gauge!
Progress_surimi_05	Short on Power Eggs? Dive into a kettle,\nand see if you can collect some more!
Progress_surimi_06	You'll need plenty of Power Eggs to register for the\nmissions inside {color[0100]}silver kettles{color[ffff]}. Keep 'em handy!
Progress_surimi_07	Have you been upgrading your Hero Gear? Could come\nin handy, especially for {color[0100]}golden kettles{color[ffff]}.
Progress_surimi_08	Is it just me, or is O.R.C.A. actually really funny?\nWho knew they could program deadpan humor?!
Progress_boss1_00	Go, go, Agent 3! If you can't do it...no one can!\nNo pressure.
Progress_boss1_01	Hey, do you have a favorite Squid Sisters track?
Progress_boss1_02	You're "supposed" to sneak behind the shielded\nOctarians, but I like to just BLAST 'em!
Progress_boss1_03	There's gotta be something more to that "treasure."\nI wonder what we could do with it...
Progress_boss2_00	You're doing a great job exploring Alterna...\nLook how much you've filled out the map!
Progress_boss2_01	Just to say it out loud... Thank you for joining\nthe New Squidbeak Splatoon, Agent 3!
Progress_boss3_00	Let's go get Gramps RIGHT NOW! I mean...\nwhen you're ready, Agent 3.
Progress_clear_00	If they can dehydrate Gramps, surely we can\nREhydrate him somehow...right?
Progress_clear_01	Hey, is it snack time yet? You hungry?
Progress_clear_02	Agent 2 doesn't think I should drive the rocket.\nBut what do YOU think, Agent 3?
Progress_clear_03	You were like a rock star out there fighting in space!\nAnd Smallfry was your backup dancer!
Progress_clear_04	Who would have thought there'd be ANOTHER rocket?!
Bored_00	...Wait—did I say that already?!
Bored_01	Ooo! I had something else I wanted to say,\nbut I forgot. Don't you hate that?
Bored_02	Oh! But maybe I told you that already...
Bored_03	Wait. Did we have this exact conversation, or was\nthat just a dream...
Gift_00	Surprise! I've got some bonus {color[0100]}Power Eggs{color[ffff]} for you,\nAgent 3! I hope Smallfry likes them...
Gift_01	Who's got pointy ears and some extra {color[0100]}Power Eggs{color[ffff]}\nfor you? THIS GIRL!
Gift_02	Guess what. I've got some extra {color[0100]}Power Eggs{color[ffff]} for you,\ncourtesy of the Captain. They said, "You're welcome"!
LaunchPad_00	Now that Agent 2 is the boss of Deep Cut, we should\ndefinitely be able to rescue Gramps!
CommonMsg\Mission\TalkWorldAtarime.msbt
Normal_00	We gotta get the Great Zapfish back from\nthose Octarian punks!
Normal_01	Y'know, that Hero Suit fits you just fine. Kids these\ndays like things a little baggy, don't they?
Normal_02	Those darn Octarians! I oughta be enjoying my\nretirement, not retiring my enjoyment!
Normal_03	When all of this is over, maybe we oughta think\nabout some security for the Great Zapfish...
Normal_04	It's nice that you got your li'l buddy with you\nthroughout all...this.
Normal_05	That Fuzzy Ooze is trouble. Don't touch it unless you\nwanna spend the next 10 years shavin'!
Normal_06	Whaddaya like to eat these days, kiddo? Food?\nAre kids still eatin' food?
Normal_07	Those kettles lead to the Octarian bases—blast 'em\nwith ink to open 'em. Don't try it on your home kettle.
Normal_08	When you're throwin' Smallfry, hold down {[030a|0000803f00000000]} and\ntake your time. Know before you throw!
Normal_09	The coolest thing about that Hero Suit? It'll heal itself\nif you let it! Just be patient.
Normal_10	If you're ever feelin' discombobulated, just relax your\nhands for a sec and press {[0303|0000803f00000000]}.
Normal_11	Don't let steel grates and fences ruin your day.\nPress {[030b|0000803f00000000]} and squidaddle right through 'em!
Normal_12	You can't spell WIN without IN, and you can't\nspell INK without IN either. Just sayin'.
Normal_14	A little too much enemy ink flyin' around? Hide behind\na wall! It ain't fancy, but it gets the job done.
Normal_15	I've said it before and I'll say it again...\nInk before you think!
Location_00	You eatin' well these days? Don't go into battle\nhungry, y'hear?
Location_01	You wonderin' about that upside-down tower?\nThat makes two of us, friend.
Location_02	You really know what you're doin' out there, don'tcha?\nMakin' me look like a genius for recruiting you!
Location_03	You know Agent 1 and Agent 2? I heard they've got\na side gig. Like bein' pop stars or somethin'.

Progress_01	The Captain wanted me to remind you that,\n"It's a sink-or-swim world out there, so be careful!"
Progress_04	Uh-oh! The Captain's mumbling again. "This wasn't\nbecause of Octavio...was it?"
Progress_07	Just so you know, the Captain's kinda shy.\nDon't take the silence personally.
Progress_08	Hey, the Captain wanted me to tell you...\nOh! Actually, never mind. False alarm!
Progress_10	"Alright, just what is the treasure Deep Cut's after..."\nThe Captain REALLY wants to get to the bottom of this.
Progress_13	Quick update... I just overheard the Captain say, "Wow!\nThere's a LOT going on in the New Squidbeak Splatoon."
Progress_16	I'm not sure what to make of it, but the Captain says,\n"You're always you, no matter what you look like."
Progress_19	Just letting you know—the Captain said, "Treasure,\neh? Could be useful." I think I see where this is going.
Progress_22	The Captain just muttered, "Please be OK, Cap'n\nCuttlefish. Please..." I'm with you, Captain.
Progress_25	New orders! The Captain says, "Go get Agent 2 a\nlatte." Nah, I'm kidding. Although if you see one...
Progress_28	Advice from the Captain: "If you ever get lost, try a\nbit of brute force!" Uh... But don't overdo it, OK?
Progress_31	A quick tip from the Captain: "Sometimes defeat is\nthe best teacher." I feel like I've heard that one.
Progress_34	Just overheard the Captain feeling nostalgic.\n"I remember when Cap'n Cuttlefish gave me this hat..."
Progress_37	The Captain's feeling worried. "I've got a sinking feeling\nabout that rocket..." Careful out there.
Progress_40	The Captain says, "Get your gear in gear. Battle can\ncome at any time!" Good advice, I say!
Progress_43	Hey, Captain! Captain? You still with us?
Progress_45	Yo! The Captain says, "Check your map now and then.\nYou may spot something new." But also, you may not.
Progress_48	Hm? Captain? Did you say something?\nOh. Guess not...
Progress_50	Fresh wisdom from the Captain: "The best victories\ncome from not having to fight at all!"
Progress_53	Hey, just checking something. Can you hear the\nCaptain's voice?
Progress_54	Message from the Captain: "Wrap up whatever it is you\ngotta do, then head to that {color[0100]}treasure{color[ffff]}!"

Normal_01	We've gathered all kinds of data, but nothing prepared\nus for what was down here...
Normal_02	You know that Hero Suit used to belong to the\nCaptain, right? Take good care of it.
Normal_03	Have you noticed that the walls are meant to look\nlike the sky? Just like in the Octarian bases!
Normal_04	If I'm twirling my parasol, that just means I'm thinking.
Normal_05	I wish I could read all of the strange writing\naround here...
Normal_08	What do you like to do in your spare time, when\nyou're not splatting or being splatted?
Normal_09	You'll need plenty of {color[0100]}Sardinium {color[ffff]}to upgrade your gear,\nso keep an eye out for it.
Normal_12	If your Hero Suit takes a hit, into the ink you\nmust get! Is that how the saying goes?
Progress_00	You've got this, Agent 3. We'll hold down the\nfort here for you.
Progress_01	How was Gramps when you were with him in the Crater?\nAs salty as always?
Progress_02	I can't believe Deep Cut is seriously out here\ntreasure hunting through all of this...

Progress_04	You'll save Gramps, won't you? We're counting\non you, Agent 3!
Progress_05	Don't worry about the treasure—the Captain is\nkeeping a close eye on it.
Progress_06	The pipeline isn't like an inkrail—you can't change\ndirections once you're in it. Sit back and enjoy the ride!
Progress_07	I'm not a materials scientist, but it seems like the\ntreasure is reacting to the Fuzzy Ooze somehow...
Progress_08	That look in your eyes... I know someone else with\nthe exact same look!
Progress_09	You'll check in on Agent 1 every so often, won't you?\nJust so I don't always have to do it...
Progress_10	Keep your chin up, Agent 3. I just know Gramps\nwould be proud of everything you've done already.
Progress_11	How do the members of Deep Cut find the time to\nmanage dual careers in both pop music and crime?
Progress_12	You're not the first Agent 3, Agent 3. Once upon a\ntime, Gramps recruited the Captain!

SpInkStorm	Throw this device to generate a rain cloud of ink.\nThe cloud gradually moves away from where the\ndevice was thrown.
SpUltraShot	Press {[030c|0000803f00000000]} to launch three blasts of spiraling ink\nin a single shot. You can fire it up to three times.
SpUltraStamp	Attack with an enormous hammer. Press and hold\n{[030c|0000803f00000000]} to advance while striking with the hammer.\nIf you press and release {[030a|0000803f00000000]}, you'll throw the\nhammer far into the distance to attack and the\nspecial will end.
SpGreatBarrier	Deploy this device at your feet to shield yourself\nwith a large, spherical barrier. This bubble will block\noutside ink attacks, but it can't prevent opponents\nthemselves from entering. Damage to the top section\nor the inner device will cause the barrier to pop\nmore quickly.
SpJetpack	This launches you into the air by spraying out\nink, allowing you to attack opponents with the\nattached launcher. You can fly higher temporarily\nby pressing {[0301|0000803f00000000]}.
SpShockSonar	Deploys a device that generates sonic waves to drive\nhidden opponents out into the open. Waves expand\nalong the ground, marking and dealing damage to any\nopponents they touch. To avoid damage, simply jump\nover each wave.
SpSuperHook	Transform into an ink-cloaked acrobat, and sling\nyour stretchy arm to zip around the battlefield!\nUse {[030a|0000803f00000000]} to aim and stick to walls. You can still\nuse your main weapon like normal with {[030c|0000803f00000000]}. When\nyour ink runs out, your transformation will end, and\nyou'll Super Jump back to your starting location.
SpSkewer	Hop onto a shark-shaped, ink-propelled float, and\ncharge forward. When you reach the end of the path,\nor if you press {[030c|0000803f00000000]}, the float will explode and\ndeal damage.
SpChariot	Leave your foes in a pinch with this scuttling tank's\nsuperior inkpower. Press {[030c|0000803f00000000]} for rapid-fire\nshots—{[030a|0000803f00000000]} will fire your cannon. Its back is\nvulnerable to enemy attacks, but you can shift into\nmobile mode with {[030b|0000803f00000000]} to protect yourself.
SpNiceBall	Funnel power into an explosive ink ball, and launch it\nat the enemy. By sending and receiving "Booyahs"\nfrom your team, you can build power more quickly.\nTeammates who send Booyahs will be rewarded by\nhaving their special gauge filled a little.
SpBlower	Make your ink shots more powerful by sucking up\nenemy attacks! Hold {[030c|0000803f00000000]} to generate a vortex\nthat sucks up enemy ink attacks. Then just release\n{[030c|0000803f00000000]} to fire a souped-up ink shot—the longer you\nhold and the more full the meter gets, the more\npowerful your shot will be!
SpMultiMissile	Press {[030c|0000803f00000000]} to fire missiles at any enemies\nwithin your targeting reticle. Locking on to\nseveral enemies will change the number of\nmissiles that hit each target.
SpMicroLaser	Unleashes six speaker-shaped, laser-emitting\ndevices to surround and devastate your enemies.\nLock on to an opponent, and the emitters will track\nand blast them wherever they go! You can continue\nto use your main weapon and sub weapon while the\nKiller Wail 5.1 is firing.
SpTripleTornado	Throw and deploy a guidance device with {[030a|0000803f00000000]} to\ncause a tornado-generating ink strike to land on that\nspot from above. You can deploy up to three guidance\ndevices to activate three separate ink tornadoes.
SpEnergyStand	Deploys a fridge stocked with drinks that enhance\nsome of your abilities for a brief time. There are\nfour drinks, but you can only have one—the rest\nare for sharing! You'll lose the enhancement if\nyou're splatted while the drink is in effect, but\nyou'll respawn right away.
CommonMsg\Weapon\WeaponExp_Sub.msbt
Bomb_Splash	A bomb that explodes a short time after it lands.\nIt inks the area around it when it explodes and can\neven take out opponents.
Bomb_Suction	A bomb that attaches to the ground and walls.\nIt takes longer to explode than the Splat Bombs\nand spreads ink farther.
Bomb_Quick	A bomb that explodes when it touches something.\nIt's a small, weak explosion, but it doesn't consume\nmuch ink, so you can throw one after another.
Bomb_Curling	A bomb that moves in a straight line, inking the\nground before it explodes. It also bounces off\nwalls! You can adjust the length of time until\ndetonation by holding down {[030a|0000803f00000000]}.
Bomb_Robot	A bomb that automatically seeks out opponents.\nIt will search for opponents in the area that you\nthrow it, and if it finds one, it will automatically\nstart walking toward them. When it approaches\nan opponent, it stops and explodes.

Shield	A device that erects a wall of ink in front of you that\nblocks enemy intrusion and attacks. Attacks from\nenemies will speed up the time it takes for the wall\nto come down. You can only place one at a time.
Beacon	A device that emits a signal that Inklings and\nOctolings can detect. You can Super Jump to a\nteammate's Squid Beakon by selecting it and\npressing {[0300|0000803f00000000]}. You can place up to three at a time.\nThey're usually single use, but allies who don't have\nthe jump beacon equipped can use them twice.
Bomb_Fizzy	A bomb loaded with special carbonated ink.\nHold {[030a|0000803f00000000]} to build power, then unleash up\nto three explosions. Shake the controller,\nmove the Stick, or mash buttons to build\npower faster!

008	Cool, looks like it's official...Agent 3.
009	My circuits are designed to measure your intellectual\nand physical prowess as demonstrated by your ability\nto complete missions throughout Alterna.{[0004]}In each mission, you must reach a goal mechanism or\ncomplete an objective. Extraordinary citizens will\ncomplete many missions and receive many {color[0100]}Power Eggs{color[ffff]}!{[0004]}You can expect a substantial Power Egg payday in\nparticular for this first mission...{[0100|1e000000]} May your\nenthusiasm result in success, citizen!
010	Is all of that going to be on the test?\nBecause all I really heard was POWER EGGS.
011	That seems like the important part. We'll need plenty\nof those if we're going to find Gramps.
012	One last thing. {[0100|0f000000]}As you complete missions and become\nan ever-more-exceptional citizen, you will naturally\ngain increased access to the {color[0100]}Alterna Log{color[ffff]}.{[0004]}Do not attempt to share the Alterna Log without\npermission.{[0100|1e000000]} Please handle the information with care.{[0100|0f000000]}\nAnd please consider this a threat.

015	Alterna Log, huh... {[0100|1e000000]}Well, something's been added to\nyour menu. I wanna peek...{[0004]}Ah, but I won't. I guess all we can do for now is collect\nPower Eggs and work on removing that Fuzzy Ooze.{[0004]}I mean...all YOU can do, Agent 3.
016	Equipment initializing...{[0100|1e000000]} Please select a {color[0100]}weapon{color[ffff]}\nfor this mission.
100	The mission will begin as soon as you pass\nthrough that gate.{[0004]}If {color[0100]}Power Eggs{color[ffff]} are required, you will be given an\nopportunity to make your payment before entering.{[0004]}《Initialization complete!》\n《Data harvesting and analysis...commencing.》{[0004]}Best of luck, Agent 3.

EventFlowMsg\Mission_BigWorldTutorial.msbt
000	We've never been here before either, but here's\nthe tour anyway...
001	We think this place is called {color[0100]}Alterna{color[ffff]}. Who knew it\nwas beneath the Crater this whole time?!
002	We count six different islands so far. What should\nwe call them? {color[0100]}Sites {color[ffff]}or something?
003	Uh, are you even gonna mention the HUMONGOUS\nrocket over there?! {[0100|1e000000]}Look at that!
004	Way to steal my thunder. Anyway...we put a tracking\ndevice on Gramps, as one does. But now we're getting\na {color[0100]}strong signal{color[ffff]} from three different areas!
005	Agent 3! Your mission is to {color[0100]}check all 3 of\nthose places out{color[ffff]}!
006	We upgraded your map a little bit. Tell us how much\nyou love it!
007	Now it tracks the {color[0100]}places you've already visited {color[ffff]}and\nlights up when you're near anything interesting.
008	Like when I'm nearby?{[0100|0f000000]} Or...buried treasure, I guess.
009	We're here to look for Gramps. Not treasure. And I\nhardly think Agent 3 needs a Callie tracker. Anyway...
010	Wait! {[0100|0f000000]}Agent 3 is totally out of Power Eggs. Did you lose\nthem all in the fall?{[0004]}YIKES!{[0100|0f000000]} Your Hero Suit is all messed up too!
011	Oh, don't be dramatic. I mean, sure, Agent 3 will have\nto collect Power Eggs...and upgrade from scratch...{[0004]}Hmmm. I guess an explanation would help.{[0004]}First, they'll need {color[0100]}{[031f|0000803f00000000]}Sardinium {color[ffff]}to {color[0100]}unlock{color[ffff]} access\nto different types of upgrades...{[0004]}Then they can spend {color[0100]}Upgrade Points{color[ffff]} to do the\nactual upgrading!
012	There's gotta be some {color[0100]}{[031f|0000803f00000000]}Sardinium {color[ffff]}down here in\nAlterna, right?{[0100|1e000000]} If anyone can find it, it's Agent 3!
013	Wait... Did you tell Agent 3 how to actually GET\n{[0320|0000803f00000000]}{color[0100]}Upgrade Points{color[ffff]}? {[0100|0f000000]}No? {[0100|0f000000]}I'm on it!{[0004]}Agent 3, just {color[0100]}ink lots of stuff {color[ffff]}and {color[0100]}find items{color[ffff]}! I guess\nit isn't rocket science. {[0100|1e000000]}Which is a shame, because it\nseems like we might NEED some rocket science...
014	Never mind that for now! I'm getting a strong Gramps-\nlike signal from the next site over. {[0100|1e000000]}Go check it out!
EventFlowMsg\Mission_DefeatBossA.msbt

001	Greater Inkopolis and the Splatlands have wildly different methods of\nserving up clam mochi. "Inkopolis style" means a clam wrapped in mochi,\nbut Splatlanders wrap the mochi with clams! They also sprinkle on sesame\nseeds and top it with hot sauce. Mmm... It's Splatsville's clam to fame!
002	"Long ago, our splatted lands were almost washed away by a great flood.\nAll was presumed lost...until three lights appeared and united to consume\nthe disaster. Thankful for their salvation, the townsfolk threw a festival\nwith three portable shrines as a tribute."
003	"Visit a sparkling city of chaos."\n"The hottest place in the Splatlands!"\n"Anarchy Avenue. Walk it. Feel it. Live it."\n—Special Collection, "Walk the Splatsville Walk," pg. 54
004	"Live wild! Live free! We do whatever we want!\nThis town is a melting pot, so let's stir things up!"\n"I'm tired of folks pretending to be cool.\nI wanna get so fired up that I boil over!"
005	For the Inklings and Octolings of the Splatlands, aggressive action\nis the best way to make a splash in the local scene. Youths will often\ndress themselves in the style of a delinquent or hooligan to intimidate\npeers during combative courtship rituals known as "rumbles."
006	"The lobby I've built doesn't have a single standout feature...'cause\nEVERYTHING in there is featureworthy! If you don't have the greatest\nTurf War experience ever, I'll eat the smaller of my two claws."\n—Glen Fiddler, President & CEO 
007	Grizzco Industries Occupational-Safety Guidelines\n(1) Keep your eggs in the game. (2) "I'll try to grab one more!"\ncould end with one less—of YOU! (3) Sea goes dark, tide goes up.\n(4) ACB: Always Check the Basket. (5) Throw eggs! Don't yolk around!
008	Salmonids mature by returning to the waters where they were spawned.\nSometimes, in very rare cases, a young Salmonid will stray too far from\ntheir original school during a run and become lost. Their wandering quest\nto return home can lead to prolonged starvation and an insatiable appetite.
009	"Splatsville's rowdiest, loud-iest trio is hijacking the airwaves!\nClean out those ears and open those eyes wide for your hometown\nhype squad, Deep Cut! Tune in and catch 'em—if you can!"
010	"A hungry blade, a sharp grin in a wild warrior's hand.\nIt bites just once—a flash, a slash, a sudden shudder.\nShredded remains sink down, down, down like falling snow.\nA fleeting flurry, brief as life itself, falls around my open parasol."
011	"Moray Eel Manipulation: Secret Dances of the Onaga Clan\nFirst: Soak the dry ground like a welcome summer rainstorm.\nSecond: Stir up a whirlpool to summon winds from the rocky shore.\nFinal: As a hundred eels take flight, follow them to the promised land."
012	The Manta Clan's Early-Morning Ritual\nAfter careful grooming of their pectoral fins, the family gathers for their\nfavorite breakfast. This unique plankton dish, a family recipe passed down\nacross generations, is said to enhance the mind, body, and bodily toxins.
013	"One year after expanding his business into a new region."\n"Bombarding the Splatlands with over 20,000 hours of rapid-fire\nweapons chatter! His steel scopes are aimed at a new horizon."\n"What's next for the so-called arsenal ambassador?"
014	"#PondSnailLikeABoss #EddyIsGnarly #ChaoticSunshine #FreshHeadgear\n#ShellfishBeFreshFish #MasterOfMerchants #NautilusIntrospection\n#GotThatGoldenRatio #GottaGetOutOfYourShell #NautCouture4Life"
015	"Man-o'-Wardrobe" "We are temporarily closed so that we may restock."\n"Cash only" "No photography or influencers allowed. Ever." "We've run\nrather low on paper bills." "We're always open. Your fashion emergency\nis our fashion emergency." "Do NOT touch it until you have PAID for it."
016	As they grow, crustaceans such as the coconut crab frequently shed their\nshells to allow for further growth. Because strong sunlight encourages\nthis shedding behavior, this may explain why Splatlands crustaceans often\ngrow to be far larger than their counterparts in other regions.
017	"YO! Barry C. here, Hotlantis's hottest (only) owner, ha! I gotta split for\na bit to stock up on...stock. （・ω<） But it's all good! Harmony (yup, from\nChirpy Chips) is fillin' in, and she knows this shop way, WAY better than\nme. (;^_^A So business? That's gonna keep right on boomin'! （＾ｖ＾）v"
018	"Fryin' out here in Scorch Gorge—in more ways than one!\n#SweatyShell #BikingTrip"
019	"Letter of Appointment\nEmployment: New Squidbeak HQ, First Splatoon\nAdjustments: Promoted to Captain with emoluments of pay grade 33.\n–Craig Cuttlefish"
020	"Thursday night / Friday morning at 1:00 AM: It's the 100th episode of\nMarie After Midnight, and a special guest stopped by to help me celebrate:\nmy cousin Callie! It's a Squid Sisters gabfest! We could NOT stop talking.\n(Not kidding. We went over the scheduled end time by five hours. Oops.)"
021	Seems these are instructions on how to mummify an Inkling. Maybe in\nolden times, Inklings thought if they preserved their bodies after death,\nthey could be revived someday? But that's... Well, there's no way this is\na real one stuck here, right? No, of course it isn't... Right?
022	After leaping from Inkopolis Square to the world stage, Off the Hook has\nfound their new side project: performing vocals for a rising rock band as\nDamp Socks feat. Off the Hook! Discovered online, their super-talented\ncollaborators offer an "upbeat melancholy" sound that had OTH...hooked!
023	"Operation: Li'l Judd's Judgy Judgment!" "Prey's behavior"\n"Analyzing prey's fur quality... No impurrfections found!"\n"I guess I'll just go after the toe beans."
024	"Subject name: 'Marigold'\nNishiyo Oranda (Alias): Anarchy District 3, 3-■\nPoisson Rouge (Alias): Rue de ■■ 19-6, Chateaubateau\nRan Chi-Yu (Alias): Southgill Province, Tailfin City, ■■■ District"
