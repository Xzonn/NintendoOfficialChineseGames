Message_00	{[0501|01cd]}{[0502|60cd]}We did it! We won a Wiggler Race—\na Flower Kingdom specialty!
Message_01	Wiggler was nice enough to give us\nan {color[0000]}Auto Super Mushroom Badge{color[ffff]} to\ncelebrate your victory!\nIt's a really great badge. It triggers\nthe effects of a Super Mushroom\nwhen you start a course.
Message_02	{[0502|60cd]}Ahhh! I love the feeling of running\nthrough a race course!
Message_03	{[0501|06cd]}{[0502|4acd]}Wiggler sure is fast. What a tough\nopponent.{[0004]}{[0502|52cd]}I bet holding {[0a0f|00cd]} to {color[0000]}dash{color[ffff]} will make\nall the difference the next time we\nrace though.
