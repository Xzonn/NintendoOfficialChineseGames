Grill	Cooking over an open flame is the best. Roast the ingredients until they're perfectly done. Just don't melt the ice!
Nunchaku	Hi-yah! Welcome to the dojo! Use the Form Stones you're holding to copy my moves. The trick is to make full, clear motions.
Rubber	Oh no...the toilet's clogged. Nothing to do but push the plunger down, then pull it up with a POP! So this is what caused all the trouble...
Stocking	Nobody likes getting stuck in a stocking. Reel in the stocking with both hands to yank it off! (This game is a work of fiction. It's not cool or attractive to put a stocking over your head in real life.)
Telescope	Did you just see a guy flying around somewhere? Get your telescope ready and find him! It's easy if you follow the contrail.

Ring	It's time to put on a show! Match the angle and thrust forward. It's not like it's magic.

Limbo_Duo	Beware of low-flying crafts! Bend your body to get out of the way. When the crown drops, stand up so it lands on your head.
Mouse	Drop one of the rocks under your arms to trigger a catapult! Have you figured out which rock will send the monkey toward the banana?
Snowman	Put some power into your posterior, and push the packed snow! It works best if you lean back a bit at the start for more oomph. I'm eager to see this snowman of yours.
Snowman_Duo	Put some power into your posterior, and push the packed snow! It works best if you lean back a bit at the start for more oomph. Whoever achieves the larger snowball will see it become the next layer for the snowman. Will that snowball be yours?

Cactus_Duo	Tilt the cactus this way and that as if it were your own body, piercing everything that comes near you!
Gift	Pass out the right tool for the job! The witch wants a broom, the cook needs a skillet, the artist requires a brush, and the fencer must have their sword.
Curtsey	Lift the hem of your dress when your counterpart does for a proper greeting. A proper lady must also tilt her head forward slightly.
Penguin	Watch the penguins slowly rocking left to right as they waddle along. Match their pace so as not to bump into them. When the seal rushes you from the front, jump!
Alpaca	Some of these alpacas could use a little more hair. Raise your pom-poms to warm them up!
Pancake	Turn the spatulas to flip the pancake. If you don't turn both at once, it'll fall apart. If your pancakes are pan-breaks, try going slowly and carefully.
Tissue	Pull every tissue from the box. Hmm. On closer inspection, these don't appear to be tissues.
Dustcloth	Wring out a soaked rag. If you can't get it all out in one go, simply take another shot at it. Hmm. On closer inspection, this doesn't appear to be a rag.

Capsule	Capsule toy machines—and they're free to play! What kind of prizes do you think are in there?
Crawl	Do you know the crawl stroke? You alternate moving your left and right arms to propel yourself forward. Break the waves, scatter your rivals, and reach the goal!
Still	Are you the newest crew member? Here, take that mirror and tilt it so that the light hits the monster's face. Excellent. Now hold it there, and we might have ourselves a film!
