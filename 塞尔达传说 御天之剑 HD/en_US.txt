KEN1_000	This is {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}. The Statue of the\nGoddess looks down on the town, and\nmost residents live in relative peace\nand harmony.\n{[0112|00000002]}Among the residents here are those\nwho have useful information for you,\nMaster, as well as those who have\ntroubles they want to talk about.\nI recommend talking to those who\nhave a {color[0000]}speech bubble {color[ffff]}visible above\ntheir heads as soon as you see them.
KEN1_001	This is {color[0003]}Sky Keep{color[ffff]}. It is situated beneath\nSkyloft's Isle of the Goddess.\n\n\nAccording to my overall analysis, \nI suggest you equip yourself with items\nthat will increase your survivability.
KEN1_002	These are the {color[0003]}Faron Woods{color[ffff]}. Dangerous\nplants and vicious monsters inhabit the\narea as well. Caution is advised.
KEN1_003	This is {color[0003]}Skyview Temple{color[ffff]}, a structure\nconstructed in ancient times. You can\nexpect to encounter many mechanisms\ndesigned to keep intruders at bay.\nWhen you find yourself unable to\ncontinue, press {[0204|22cd]} to {color[0004]}look around{color[ffff]}.\nIt will certainly help you find your way\nforward.{[0111|08cd]}{[010c|00060067]}
KEN1_003_1	Focusing on your enemy's weaknesses\nand deliberately swinging at the\ncorrect {color[0000]}sword angle {color[ffff]}will increase\neffective results by 85%.
KEN1_003_2	Press {[0204|07cd]} to lock on to an enemy,\nthen press {[0204|11cd]} to ask me for analysis.{[0111|07cd]}{[0111|09cd]}\n\n\n{[0112|00000002]}In some circumstances it will take me\na while to compile and calculate my\nanalysis, but I predict an 85% chance\nyou will find my results helpful.
KEN1_003_3	The portcullis is sealing the door.\nJust as the first door, you will need to\nstrike the gemstone switch to open it.\n\nThe gemstone switch that acts as a key\nof sorts in this temple should {color[0000]}always be\nclose to the door{color[ffff]}.\n\nWhen you find you can't advance\nany farther, I always recommend you\nsearch the immediate vicinity. 
KEN1_003_4	Some maps you obtain contain hints\neasily missed by the human eye.\n\n\nWhen you can't go any further,\nI suggest you {color[0004]}open your map{color[ffff]} with {[0204|02cd]}\nand look closely for potential clues.{[0111|02cd]}
KEN1_003_5	The sacred water said to be able to\ncure the Water Dragon's wounds can\nbe found in the inner sanctum of\nthis temple.
KEN1_003_6	You obtained the sacred water said to\nhave the power to cure the Water\nDragon's wounds. I recommend\nreturning to her.
KEN1_003_7	It appears that the lock and chains\nbarring certain doors cannot be\ndeactivated by a gemstone switch.\n\nI recommend searching for a\n{color[0005]}{[0201|0001]} {color[ffff]}inside this temple that\nwill fit the keyhole.
KEN1_003_8	Using the {color[0005]}{[0201|0001]} {color[ffff]}you obtained will\nenable you to continue on deeper into \nthe temple.
KEN1_003_9	Use the {color[0005]}{[0201|0035]} {color[ffff]}you obtained to\nexplore and investigate your\nsurroundings from high in the air.
KEN1_003_10	I have detected {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}'s aura from deep\nwithin this temple. I recommend\nopening the large door.
KEN1_005	This is {color[0003]}Eldin Volcano{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060069]}
KEN1_005_1	The steep slopes and scorching magma\nmake this an inhospitable\nenvironment for life.\n\nHowever, some monsters have adapted\nto this harsh land and now possess the\nability to control fire itself.\n\nYou must pay heed to their attacks,\nas well as to falling into lava, as your\nhighly flammable {color[0003]}Wooden Shield{color[ffff]} will\nbe of little use if it's {color[0000]}on fire{color[ffff]}.
KEN1_005_2	When monsters block your path, your\n{color[0005]}Slingshot {color[ffff]}may prove to be the most\neffective weapon.
KEN1_005_3	If you deliver a significant blow to the\nbase of the neighboring {color[0003]}watchtower{color[ffff]}, \nI project a 90% probability that it will\ntopple over.
KEN1_005_4	You can propel a {color[0005]}bomb {color[ffff]}farther away\nby {color[0004]}rolling it {color[ffff]}than by {color[0004]}throwing it{color[ffff]}.\nI recommend you consider rolling a\nbomb when throwing won't reach. 
KEN1_005_5	Now that you have all the {color[0003]}pieces of the\nkey{color[ffff]}, I recommend you head to the\n{color[0000]}large door {color[ffff]}on the summit. 
KEN1_005_6	I recommend that you check to see if\nthe wall by the nearby {color[0000]}area with three\ntents{color[ffff]} can be destroyed with a bomb. 
KEN1_005_7	It appears there are {color[0000]}two{color[ffff]} {color[0003]}Mogmas {color[ffff]}in the\nback of this area with three tents. \nI recommend that you talk to them. 
KEN1_005_8	Signs indicate something needs to be\ndone about the pooled lava. I suggest\nyou search the surroundings.
KEN1_005_9	In order to most effectively protect\nScrapper, I recommend you make use\nof your {color[0000]}bow{color[ffff]} to dispatch monsters that\nattempt to attack the robot.
KEN1_005_10	In order to find the {color[0003]}propeller{color[ffff]}, I advise\nyou to descend to the surface and use\nyour {color[0004]}dowsing{color[ffff]} ability to search for it.
KEN1_006	This is the {color[0003]}Fire Dragon's Hall{color[ffff]}.\nIt is even hotter here than other\nplaces we've been in the volcano.\n\nI can confirm this mechanism is the\nsame as the one found at the Earth\nTemple.
KEN1_007	This is the {color[0003]}Earth Temple{color[ffff]}. Signs\nindicate it was built here because of\nthe subterranean caverns below.\n\nJust as at Skyview Temple, many\ndefensive mechanisms were built here\nto discourage would-be intruders.\n\nWhen you are unable to progress, I\nrecommend you press {[0204|22cd]} to {color[0004]}look\naround {color[ffff]}and check your surroundings\nfor anything you may have missed.{[0111|08cd]}\nYou also have the option to explore\nusing your {color[0005]}Beetle{color[ffff]}.
KEN1_009	This is {color[0003]}Lanayru Desert{color[ffff]}. Over many\ncenturies, the sand has covered nearly\nall {color[0000]}remnants of the past{color[ffff]}.{[010c|0006006d]}
KEN1_009_1	Some of the monsters of this region\nproduce an electrical field that can\nparalyze anything that touches them.\n\nAs a protective measure, I recommend\nusing a {color[0005]}Wooden Shield{color[ffff]}. You should also\nconsider keeping a {color[0005]}Revitalizing Potion\n{color[ffff]}or a {color[0005]}spare shield{color[ffff]} in your pouch.
KEN1_009_2	I recommend you open your map\nwith {[0204|02cd]} and study the local terrain\nbefore you continue on.{[0111|02cd]}
KEN1_010	This is the northwestern region\nof {color[0003]}Lanayru Desert{color[ffff]}. The {color[0000]}Temple of\nTime {color[ffff]}is visible from this location.\nWe stand at the temple's front gate. \nWhen you can't progress any farther, \nI recommend investigating the complex\nterrain of the area to see if you find\nanything hidden.\n{[0112|00000001]}Master, due to the topography of the\nlocal terrain, visibility will be limited.\nYour {color[0005]}Beetle{color[ffff]}'s exploratory capabilities\nare suited to tackling this problem.
KEN1_011	This is the {color[0003]}Lanayru Sand Sea{color[ffff]}.\nThough it may seem implausible,\nI assure you that this area once\nfeatured a vast body of water.\nI have detected the presence of many\nmonsters in the area, though they are\na weaker variety than those found in\nareas {color[0000]}to the north{color[ffff]}.
KEN1_012	This is {color[0003]}Lanayru Gorge{color[ffff]}. Of all the\nTimeshift Stone mining areas here,\nthis was the very first to be mined.{[010c|00060070]}
KEN1_012_1	I detect the bones of a large creature to\nthe south. I calculate an 85% chance\nyou can obtain information about it by\nusing your {color[0005]}Beetle{color[ffff]} to explore the area.
KEN1_012_2	While exploring {color[0003]}Lanayru Gorge{color[ffff]},\nI suggest you stock your pouch with\nitems that will help you maintain\nyour health.\nYou might also consider drinking\n{color[0005]}Stamina {color[ffff]}and {color[0005]}Invincibility Potions\n{color[ffff]}together when you need to quickly\nreact to unforeseen circumstances.
KEN1_012_3	Signs indicate a 75% chance that these\nrobots can provide you with useful\ninformation. I recommend listening\nto what they have to say. 
KEN1_012_4	{[0112|00000002]}The robots in the area warned that the\n{color[0003]}Life Tree Seedling {color[ffff]}you possess must\nbe planted {color[0000]}somewhere other than\nLanayru Province{color[ffff]}.\nI recommend locating a place that will\n{color[0000]}provide ample time {color[ffff]}for the seedling\nto grow.
KEN1_012_5	{[0112|00000001]}The {color[0003]}Life Tree Fruit {color[ffff]}you have obtained\nis needed to cure the Thunder Dragon,\nwho dwells in Lanayru Gorge.
KEN1_012_6	In areas of sinksand, you can vastly\nincrease your ease of travel by\ndrinking a {color[0005]}Stamina{color[ffff]} {color[0005]}Potion{color[ffff]} and\n{color[0005]}Invincibility Potion {color[ffff]}together. 
KEN1_013	This is {color[0003]}Lanayru Mining Facility{color[ffff]}.\nIn ancient times, this was a hub\nof highly advanced technology.{[010c|00060071]}
KEN1_013_1	The ancient machinery is now broken \nand rusted. The switch that operates\nthese machines is {color[0000]}buried under sand{color[ffff]}.
KEN1_013_2	The {color[0005]}Gust Bellows {color[ffff]}generates a high-\nvelocity stream of air that can blow\naway various objects.\n\nIf you use this new device, my analysis\nindicates you will have a significantly\nincreased chance of opening a path\nthat was previously blocked to you.
KEN1_013_3	Some maps you obtain contain hints\nthat are hidden to the human eye.\n\n\nWhen you can't go any further, \nI recommend you {color[0004]}open your map{color[ffff]} with\n{[0204|02cd]} and look closely for potential clues.{[0111|02cd]}
KEN1_013_4	Press {[0204|07cd]} to lock on to an enemy,\nthen press {[0204|11cd]} to ask me for analysis.{[0111|07cd]}{[0111|09cd]}\n\n\n{[0112|00000002]}In some circumstances, it will take me\na while to compile and calculate my\nanalysis, but I predict an 85% chance\nyou will find my results helpful.
KEN1_013_5	With a {color[0000]}mighty gust of wind{color[ffff]}, that which\nis hidden in the sand will become\nvisible, and the way will be revealed.
KEN1_013_6	In the present time, some objects are\nno longer functional due to extreme\nage, but they can be returned to an\nactive state when time is shifted back.\nI calculate an 85% chance the path\nahead will open if you continue within\nthe confines of the time-shifted area.
KEN1_013_7	There is a drawing on the western wall.\nSigns indicate it may have something\nto do with the mechanisms in this room.
KEN1_014	This is the {color[0003]}Sandship{color[ffff]}. Long ago, it was\nseized by monsters.{[010c|00060072]}
KEN1_014_1	I recommend exploring the interior\nof the ship to locate the {color[0003]}sacred flame{color[ffff]}.
KEN1_014_2	You need to release the Timeshift\nStone again. There is a 95% probability\nthe closed cover can be opened using\nthe switch at the {color[0000]}top of the mast{color[ffff]}.
KEN1_014_3	My analysis indicates that it is possible\nto charge a {color[0003]}Skyward Strike{color[ffff]} in the usual\nfashion even within the close confines\nof the ship.
KEN1_014_4	Master, thanks to your efforts, the ship\nhas been returned to the captain\nand crew.\n\nBy striking the {color[0000]}Timeshift Stone {color[ffff]}on\nthe main mast, you can transport\nyourself between the present and\npast in the surrounding space.
KEN1_014_5	When fighting in narrow passageways,\nit is much more effective to attack\nwith {color[0000]}shield bashes {color[ffff]}and {color[0000]}sword thrusts\n{color[ffff]}than by swinging your sword.
KEN1_014_6	This mechanism is the same as the one\nyou previously encountered that\nrequired four gemstone switches to be\nstruck in the correct order.\nOn the left and right, you will find\nsteering wheels with their upper halves\npainted red.\n\nFinally, 80% of the room itself is\ncovered in a blanket of sand. The floor\nitself is hidden. Careful and thorough\nexploration of the room is required.
KEN1_014_7	If you open your map with {[0204|02cd]}, you will\nbe able to access a lot of information,\nincluding a designation for what door\nyou can open using the {color[0003]}Small Key{color[ffff]}.{[0111|02cd]}
KEN1_014_8	I have confirmed that the mechanism\nthat sits atop the main mast can be\ntriggered using your {color[0003]}bow and arrows{color[ffff]}.\n\nI calculate an 85% probability that\nactivating this mechanism will yield\na favorable result, allowing you to\nprogress forward.
KEN1_014_9	I infer that the crew members LD-301\nSkipper asked you to rescue are located\nat the {[0204|19cd]} point on the map.
KEN1_014_10	The {color[0003]}Timeshift Stone {color[ffff]}installed on the\nmain mast, if used properly, has an\n85% probability of clearing the ship\ninterior of obstacles.\nI conjecture that it is possible to strike\nthe Timeshift Stone outside from\nwithin the ship as long as {color[0000]}{[010b|00000004]}{color[0000]}it is {color[0000]}{color[ffff]}{color[0000]}visible\nfrom your location{color[ffff]}.
KEN1_014_11	I have confirmed the object sitting\nhigh on the main mast is a {color[0000]}Timeshift\nStone{color[ffff]}. When activated, it will have a\ndramatic effect on the ship.
KEN1_016	You are located in the northeastern\narea of the {color[0003]}Sealed Grounds{color[ffff]}.\nAn ancient forest remains here,\nseemingly preserved in time.\nThe {color[0003]}Woodland Rhino Beetle {color[ffff]}makes its\nhome here. If you {color[0004]}roll into a wall and\ncause it to shake{color[ffff]}, it will likely fall\ndown. You can then capture the bug.
KEN1_017	We are now located at the {color[0003]}Sealed\nGrounds{color[ffff]}. There is a large spiral-\nshaped depression in the ground.\n\nIt is unclear whether this topography\nis natural or artificial.\n\n\nIn this area, I recommend carrying\n{color[0000]}heart{color[ffff]}{color[0000]}-replenishing {color[ffff]}items in your\npouch.
KEN1_018	This place is called the {color[0003]}Sealed Temple{color[ffff]}.\nJudging by the extent of structural\ndegradation, I project that it has stood\nhere for a very long time.\nDue to its solid stone construction,\nthe air inside is relatively cool. There\nis also an unquantifiable mystery to\nthis place. I detect no monsters here.
KEN1_019	This place has a 99% visual correlation\nwith the {color[0003]}Sealed Temple{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nHowever, unlike the Sealed Temple you\nare familiar with, this building has\nnot suffered any long-term structural\ndegradation.
KEN1_020	This is an island known as the\n{color[0003]}Isle of Songs{color[ffff]}. It is a place mentioned in\nthe Ballad of the Goddess, an ancient\nsong handed down in {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060078]}
KEN1_020_1	If you {color[0004]}push and activate {color[ffff]}the rotating\ndevice in the center of the island,\nit appears that the surrounding\nstructures move with it.\nSigns indicate it is a mechanism\ndesigned to enable entrance into the\nbuilding ahead. 
KEN1_022	You are currently located inside\n{color[0003]}Farore's Flame Chamber{color[ffff]}. It is a sacred\nplace protected by the power of the\ngoddess.\nThe sword-enhancing {color[0000]}sacred flame {color[ffff]}is\nlocated here. 
KEN1_023	You are currently located inside {color[0003]}Din's\nFlame Chamber{color[ffff]}. It is a sacred place\nprotected by the power of the goddess.\n\nThe sword-enhancing {color[0000]}sacred flame {color[ffff]}is\nlocated here. 
KEN1_024	This is the underground channel \nthat leads away from {color[0003]}Lake Floria{color[ffff]},\nwhich is located in the southern part\nof {color[0003]}Faron Woods{color[ffff]}.\nWhen you can't go any further, press\n{[0112|00000002]}{[0204|25cd]} to check your {color[0004]}possible actions{color[ffff]}.\nThat should help reveal what you need\nto do to proceed.{[0111|0bcd]}
KEN1_026	This is the {color[0003]}Thrill Digger area{color[ffff]}. It is a\ngame run by a Mogma called {color[0003]}Tubert{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nIt appears as though there is another\n{color[0003]}Mogma {color[ffff]}here. There is a 95% chance\nthat he has some information.
KEN1_027	Your current location is the {color[0003]}Skyview\nSpring{color[ffff]}. It is a sacred place protected\nby the power of the goddess.\n\nAccording to legend, the water here\npurifies the body of any life-form that\ncomes into direct contact with it.
KEN1_028	This is the {color[0003]}Earth Spring{color[ffff]}. It is a sacred\nplace protected by the power of the\ngoddess.\n\nAccording to legend, the water here\npurifies the body of any life-form that\ncomes into direct contact with it.
KEN1_031	Yes, {[0112|00000005]}Master.{[010c|00060083]}
KEN1_031_1	This place has no name registered in\nmy memory, and I have no useful data\nto share about it.\n\nIf you want to check your current\nlocation, press {[0204|02cd]} to\nview the map.{[0111|02cd]}
KEN1_032	We are at the {color[0003]}Sealed Grounds{color[ffff]}. The Isle\nof the Goddess descended from the\nsky and landed in the vast spiral-\nshaped depression in the ground.\nI have also detected that certain\nbreeds of insect, formerly absent\nfrom the surface, are now living\nin the area.
KEN1_034	In this {color[0003]}Ancient Cistern{color[ffff]}, purified water\nis released into the upper area of the\nfacility, while the filtered impurities\nare processed in the lower area.{[010c|00060086]}
KEN1_034_1	A stone tablet sits in front of the large\nstatue in the center of the cistern.\n\n\nI calculate a 90% chance that it\ncontains information that will aid\nyou in navigating this facility.
KEN1_034_2	I have logged the following words that\nyou discovered written on the stone\ntablet in front of the large statue.\n\n“Carved into the {color[0000]}great statue {color[ffff]}are\ninscriptions of gratitude. They\nreveal the {color[0000]}secret order {color[ffff]}of this\ntemple."\n“First the {color[0000]}back{color[ffff]}, then the {color[0000]}rear{color[ffff]}, then\nthe {color[0000]}back of the right palm{color[ffff]}, and\nfinally the {color[0000]}back of the left palm{color[ffff]}."
KEN1_034_3	The giant green lily pads in this area\ncan be {color[0000]}turned upside down{color[ffff]} by jumping\ndown onto them from a great height.
KEN1_034_4	When fighting an enemy who wields\nmultiple swords, aim your strikes for\nthe undefended areas between its\nblades.\nIf the enemy guards itself from above,\nbelow, left, and right, there is a 75%\nchance the enemy will be momentarily\nvulnerable to attacks to its center.
KEN1_034_5	If you find yourself with questions\nabout unfamiliar switches or objects,\ndo not hesitate to summon me.\n\nTarget the object in question by\nholding {[0204|07cd]}. Next, while targeting,\npress {[0204|11cd]} and I will report any\ninformation I have on the subject.{[0111|07cd]}{[0111|09cd]}
KEN1_034_6	In some cases, once you've latched on\nto an object with your {color[0005]}Whip{color[ffff]}, you can\nhang from it and use it as you would\nwhen holding on to a rope.
KEN1_034_7	{[0112|00000001]}Master, your {color[0005]}Beetle{color[ffff]} has the ability to\nsever thin cords or filaments, such as\nstrands of rope or Deku Baba stems.
KEN1_034_8	The {color[0000]}Whip{color[ffff]} has the ability to both strike\nand latch on to objects on the {color[0000]}other\nside{color[ffff]} of this set of iron bars.
KEN1_034_9	It appears that by activating this\nmechanism, a portion of the statue has\nreceded into the ground.\n\nI conjecture that you should now be\nable to access an underground area\nfrom {color[0000]}inside the statue{color[ffff]}.
KEN1_034_10	When the path ahead seems closed to\nyou, I recommend utilizing your {color[0005]}Beetle{color[ffff]}\nto conduct a thorough search of the\narea.\nIf you survey the area in this fashion,\nI calculate an 80% probability that you\nwill find a hidden mechanism that will\naid your exploration of the area.
KEN1_034_11	There is a 90% chance you will need to\n{color[0000]}change the direction {color[ffff]}of the rotating\nmechanism {color[0000]}multiple times {color[ffff]}before you\ncan gain access to the path forward.
KEN1_034_12	You can latch on to a variety of objects\nwith your whip.\n\n\nIf an object can be {color[0004]}targeted{color[ffff]} with {[0204|07cd]},\nI recommend you try to attach your\nwhip to it to see if there is a result.{[0111|07cd]}
KEN1_035	This is the {color[0003]}Fire Sanctuary{color[ffff]}. It is located\non {color[0003]}Eldin Volcano{color[ffff]}, near the crater of\nthe volcano. The temperature inside\nthe sanctuary is extremely high.\nSigns indicate that the {color[0003]}Water Fruit {color[ffff]}that\nhangs from the ceiling will prove quite\nuseful in this oppressive heat.
KEN1_036	This is {color[0003]}Lanayru Mine{color[ffff]}. Ore was mined\nhere at one time, but it is no longer an\nactive mine.\n\nYou can see the remnants of a highly\nefficient transport system here. Mined\nore was carried in carts that ran on an\nancient form of energy.\nThese carts are vital to moving around\nthis area. Grab a cart with {[0204|00cd]}, and\nmove it with {[0204|08cd]}.
KEN1_037	{[0112|00000002]}Master, this is a world built from your\nmemories by {color[0003]}Lanayru{color[ffff]}, the Thunder\nDragon. Just as in the real world, there\nis a danger of losing your life here.
KEN1_038	This is {color[0003]}Faron Woods{color[ffff]}. The whole forest\nhas been turned into a lake.{[010c|0006008a]}
KEN1_038_1	I recommend searching above the\nwater for the dragon you seek.
KEN1_038_2	The origin of the current flood has\nbeen confirmed as the {color[0000]}base of the great\ntree{color[ffff]}. I recommend a thorough search\nof that area.
KEN1_038_3	Sets of same-colored, musical-note-\nshaped creatures here must be\ncollected within a set time or I project\nthey will swim off your score.
KEN1_038_4	It appears that using your underwater\nspin maneuver pulls nearby Tadtones\ntoward you, making it easier to\ncollect them.
KEN1_038_5	Performing lengthy tasks underwater\ncan be made easier through the use of\n{color[0003]}Air Potions{color[ffff]}, which can be purchased\nfrom the Potion Shop in Skyloft.
KEN1_039	Your current location is the {color[0003]}Lanayru\nCaves{color[ffff]}. Routes to all areas of {color[0003]}Lanayru\nProvince {color[ffff]}intersect here.\n\nYou can sit on a lone chair here to\nrestore your health. 
KEN1_040	I have no record of this place. Analysis\nsuggests this is a space created by the\npowerful magic of {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}.\n\nThat may be the reason you {color[0000]}can't use\nyour Skyward{color[ffff]} {color[0000]}Strike{color[ffff]} here.
KEN1_041	This is {color[0003]}Bamboo Island{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n\nIt is the secluded hideaway of {color[0003]}Peater{color[ffff]},\nfather of the Item Check clerk,\n{color[0003]}Peatrice{color[ffff]}. Here, you can attempt the\n{color[0003]}Clean Cut {color[ffff]}bamboo-slicing game.
KEN1_042	This is the{color[0003]} {color[ffff]}{color[0003]}Lumpy Pumpkin{color[ffff]}, a\nrefreshment-distribution hub run by\n{color[0003]}Pumm{color[ffff]}. It has established local\nrenown for its pumpkin soup.
KEN1_043	When you are fighting a Deku Baba,\npay attention to how it opens its\nmouth and swing your sword\naccordingly.\nIt is also effective to shield bash the\nDeku Baba at the moment it attacks.
KEN1_044	You can spend the Rupees or treasure\nyou have obtained during your travels\nat the bazaar to buy items or enhance\nyour existing items.\nI highly recommend that you visit the\nbazaar whenever you return to Skyloft.
KEN1_045	You can use the treasure and materials\nyou find during your adventures to\nenhance and upgrade your items.\n\nAt the {color[0003]}bazaar{color[ffff]}, you can also use things\nyou have found to infuse potions,\nmaking them even more effective.
KEN1_046	Analysis indicates that effective map\nuse will be critical when navigating\nthrough {color[0003]}Sky Keep{color[ffff]}.\n\nIt is also possible to access your map\nwith {[0204|02cd]} while you are operating the\ncontrol panel that moves the rooms.{[0111|02cd]}
KEN1_047	Analysis indicates that the key to\nadvancing through this room is\ncarefully choosing where to set\ndown the {color[0003]}Timeshift Orb{color[ffff]}.
KEN1_048	The effects of the {color[0003]}Timeshift Orb {color[ffff]}have\naltered this room significantly.\n\n\n{[0112|00000002]}Analysis indicates that you will have\nto set down the Timeshift Orb and\n{color[0000]}complete another task {color[ffff]}to progress\nfarther, Master.
KEN1_049	When fighting in narrow passageways,\nit is much more effective to attack\nwith {color[0000]}shield bashes {color[ffff]}and sword {color[0000]}thrusts\n{color[ffff]}than by swinging your sword.
KEN1_050	In addition to the Triforce, I detect\na strong evil aura in this room.\n\n\nThere is an 85% probability that a\npowerful monster dwells here.\nBe sure to carefully monitor your\nhealth for any precipitous drops.
KEN1_051	I recommend carefully {color[0004]}looking around{color[ffff]}\nto gather information that may help\nyou advance through this area.
KEN1_052	It is possible to use your {color[0000]}dowsing {color[ffff]}ability\nto locate hidden objects or creatures.\n\n\nHowever, you may need to use your\nsword to strike an object with a\ncreature hiding behind it in order to\nscare the creature out into the open.
KEN1_053	Your dowsing ability can detect objects\nthrough walls and terrain, so if you\ncannot see the target, you may need\nto go around and search the other side.
KEN1_054	I suggest you press {[0204|02cd]} to check and\nsee if there are any areas you have not\nyet visited.{[0111|02cd]}\n\nSimulations have shown that in 90% of\nthese scenarios, a {color[0000]}newly obtained item\n{color[ffff]}will allow you to enter an area you have\nnot yet visited.
KEN1_055	There is an 85% probability that your\n{color[0005]}Slingshot {color[ffff]}will allow you to make new\ndiscoveries in Skyloft.\n\nI recommend experimenting with your\nSlingshot in a variety of locations\nthere.
KEN1_056	This area is known as the {color[0003]}Deep Woods\nof Faron Woods{color[ffff]}. Deku Hornet hives are\ncommon here, so exercise caution.\n\nWith a suitable {color[0000]}bug-catching tool{color[ffff]}, your\nchances of avoiding harm increase\nby 75%.
KEN1_057	Signs indicate the {[0204|19cd]} marks on this\nmap were added by the previous owner\nto designate locations of interest.\n\nI recommend a thorough investigation\nof these locations when you have the\nopportunity.
KEN1_058	In most cases, mechanisms that control\nthe operation of gates and portcullises\ncan be found nearby.\n\nUsing your {color[0005]}Beetle{color[ffff]} to explore the\nsurrounding environment is an\neffective method of locating these\nswitches.
KEN1_059	This is the {color[0003]}Knight Academy{color[ffff]}.{[010c|0006009f]}
KEN1_059_1	This building contains {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}'s room,\namong others, but it is currently\nlocked.
KEN1_059_2	Recently, there have been rumors of an\nunsettling noise coming from the\n{color[0003]}restroom {color[ffff]}at night.
KEN1_059_3	If you have sustained damage, a visit\nto your room is advisable. {color[0004]}Sitting{color[ffff]} on\nthe chair located in your room will\nallow you to restore your hearts.
KEN1_060	This is {color[0003]}Beedle's Airshop{color[ffff]}. He sells rare\nitems not found in the bazaar.\n\n\nIncidentally, you may wish to note that\nyou can {color[0000]}sleep in the bed {color[ffff]}found in his\nshop.
KEN1_061	This is the {color[0003]}bazaar{color[ffff]}. You can purchase\nvarious items here that you will need\non your adventure.{[010c|000600a1]}

KEN1_061_2	Apparently, if you {color[0004]}shoot {color[ffff]}the lamp at\nthe entrance, something will happen.\nI recommend testing this out on other\nsuspicious targets as well.
KEN1_061_3	I also recommend {color[0004]}sitting{color[ffff]} at a table\nat the restaurant and listening to the\nother customers. They may have\ninformation that is useful to you.
KEN1_062	This is the {color[0003]}Sparring Hall{color[ffff]}. Here, you can\nlearn essential sword techniques.\n\n\nI recommend that you be sure to study\nthe {color[0004]}fatal blow {color[ffff]}technique that is\ntaught to students of this academy.
KEN1_063	This is {color[0003]}Batreaux's house{color[ffff]}.{[010c|000600a3]}
KEN1_063_1	Sorry, I currently have insufficient\ndata with which to analyze the\nsituation.

KEN1_065	This is {color[0003]}Pipit's house{color[ffff]}.{[010c|000600a5]}
KEN1_065_1	His mother, {color[0003]}Mallara{color[ffff]}, can't stand\ncleaning up, so their house is always\nin various states of uncleanliness.\n\nIt may be possible for you to assist\nthem later, but for now there is a 95%\nprobability you will be unable to help.{[0112|00000002]}
KEN1_065_2	His mother, {color[0003]}Mallara{color[ffff]}, can't stand\ncleaning up, so their house is always\nin various states of uncleanliness.\n\nIf you possess an item that could blow\naway the dust with a gust of wind, then\nyou may be able to help, Master.{[0112|00000002]}
KEN1_065_3	Thanks to your efforts, the room is now\nclean.\n\n\nI recommend you seek out other people\nwho may need your help, Master.{[0112|00000002]}
KEN1_066	This is {color[0003]}Rupin the gear peddler's house{color[ffff]}.\nThere is an 85% chance that visiting at\nnight will reveal the true {color[0003]}Rupin{color[ffff]}, who\ndiffers from his daytime persona.
KEN1_067	This is the house of {color[0003]}Peatrice{color[ffff]}, who\nworks at the {color[0003]}Item Check{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nI calculate an 80% probability that\nregular visits to the Item Check\nduring the day will change {color[0003]}Peatrice{color[ffff]}'s\nfeelings toward you.
KEN1_068	This is the {color[0003]}cave behind the waterfall{color[ffff]}.\nIt is one of the more dangerous places\nin Skyloft, due to the abundance of\nmonsters that call it home.\nI can confirm the existence of treasure\nchests. I recommend exploring the area\naround that {color[0000]}broken fence{color[ffff]}.
KEN1_069	This is{color[0003]} Sparrot {color[ffff]}the {color[0003]}fortune-teller{color[ffff]}'s\nhouse.{[010c|000600a9]}

KEN1_075	This is the {color[0003]}interior of the Pirate\nStronghold{color[ffff]}. This area is dangerous.\nYou may want to equip items in your\npouch that will restore health quickly.
KEN1_076	{color[0003]}Skipper's Retreat {color[ffff]}is on this island.\nI estimate that your {color[0005]}whip{color[ffff]} and\n{color[0005]}Clawshots {color[ffff]}will be needed to traverse\nthis dramatic and forbidding terrain.
KEN1_077	The {color[0003]}Shipyard {color[ffff]}is on this island.\n\n\n\nIf you incorrectly operate the cart\nand fall off the track, you will not\nlose any hearts. As long as you\noperate it calmly, you will be fine.

KEN1_084	This subterranean area lies {color[0003]}beneath\nEldin Volcano{color[ffff]}. The elaborate system\nof tunnels here forms a complex web.\n\n{color[0003]}Bomb Flowers{color[ffff]} grow here, as they do\naboveground. When {color[0004]}rolled{color[ffff]}, they make\neffective weapons against enemies \nwho are blocking your way.
KEN1_085	We are now at the summit of {color[0003]}Eldin\nVolcano{color[ffff]}, near the great crater.\n\n\nThere is a 90% chance that the final \n{color[0000]}sacred flame{color[ffff]} is located ahead of us.\nI recommend searching for it.

KEN1_086_1	I detect a strong power in the area to\nthe {color[0000]}southeast{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nThere is a 60% probability that it is the\ndragon who knows {color[0003]}another part of the\nSong of the Hero{color[ffff]}.
KEN1_087	I detect the sound of a waterfall from\n{color[0000]}the passageway to the south{color[ffff]}. It would\nappear that there is {color[0003]}water{color[ffff]} near the\narea we just passed.

KEN1_090	There is an abundance of heart\nflowers growing here. Be sure to\nuse them to restore your health\nas needed.\nA heart-flower stem that has already\nbeen picked once will produce another\nheart if you {color[0000]}pour water from a bottle{color[ffff]}\non it.
KEN1_091	A {color[0005]}Bug Net{color[ffff]} is best for catching {color[0003]}Fairies{color[ffff]},\nbut it is also possible to catch them by\nscooping them up directly with an\n{color[0005]}Empty Bottle{color[ffff]}.

KEN1_093	This is the {color[0003]}Fire Sanctuary{color[ffff]}.{[010c|000600c1]}
KEN1_093_1	The {color[0003]}Water Fruit{color[ffff]} that hangs from\nthe ceiling may be useful in this\nenvironment of extreme heat.\n\nIf you are getting stuck here, there is\nan 85% probability that scouting the\narea with your {color[0005]}Beetle {color[ffff]}or experimenting\nwith your {color[0005]}Gust Bellows {color[ffff]}will be useful.

KEN1_094_1	While pressing {[0204|07cd]} to lock on to a\ntarget, you can also press {[0204|11cd]} to ask me\nfor an analysis of the target.{[0111|07cd]}{[0111|09cd]}\n\n{[0112|00000002]}It may take me some time to gather\nsufficient data on some targets, but\nthere is an 85% probability that any\neventual results will be of use, Master.
KEN1_094_2	I can confirm that the ominous aura\nI detected in this area earlier is no\nlonger present. This area is now safe.

KEN1_096	You must pay close attention to how\nyou use bombs in this area. Analysis\nindicates that it will be more effective\nto {color[0004]}roll{color[ffff]} bombs than throw them.\nAlso, some objects here occasionally\nshock you.

KEN2_000	To search for {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, I recommend you\n{color[0004]}dive{color[ffff]} into the {color[0000]}column of light {color[ffff]}in the\nclouds and fall to the ground below.\n\nThe column of light is to the south of\n{color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_001	Search the surface and look for clues\nto ascertain {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}'s whereabouts as\nquickly as possible.{[010c|000600c9]}
KEN2_001_1	I've detected remnants of civilization\nhere on the surface. I advise you to\nfirst explore the area near where you\ntouched down.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_001_2	I recommend you follow the advice of\nthe old woman at the {color[0003]}Sealed Temple \n{color[ffff]}and head to {color[0003]}Faron Woods{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_002	{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} is alive, but she is currently in\nmotion. You must expedite your search\nfor her.{[010c|000600ca]}
KEN2_002_1	Zelda is likely to be perceived as a\nconspicuous character in these woods.\nConfer with local life-forms to see if\nthey know her whereabouts.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_002_2	Based on information received from\nthe Kikwi {color[0003]}Machi{color[ffff]}, there is an 80%\nchance that finding the Kikwi elder\nwill aid our search for Zelda.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_002_3	If we can locate all of the Kikwis\nscattered throughout the area, it is\nlikely the elder Kikwi will be able to\nprovide helpful information.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_002_4	I recommend that you climb onto\n{color[0003]}Bucha{color[ffff]}'s back and take the Kikwi\nheirloom.
KEN2_003	Based on oral reports from the Kikwis\nwe have encountered, I calculate a\n95% chance that {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} headed to the\ntemple located deep in {color[0003]}Faron Woods{color[ffff]}.\n{[0112|00000001]}Master, I advise that you travel to that\nlocation as quickly as possible.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_004	There is an 85% probability that Zelda\ncurrently resides in {color[0003]}Skyview\nTemple {color[ffff]}located in the northeastern\narea of {color[0003]}Faron Woods{color[ffff]}.\nI anticipate the temple will be occupied\nby a large number of monsters. You\nmust locate Zelda as fast as possible.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_005	Based on the song from the goddess\nstatue within {color[0003]}Skyview Temple{color[ffff]},\nthere is a 97% chance {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} has\nheaded for {color[0000]}Eldin Province{color[ffff]}.\nI advise you to take the tablet you just\nacquired and place it in the {color[0000]}altar\n{color[ffff]}housed within the {color[0003]}Statue of the\nGoddess {color[ffff]}in {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.\nDoing so should result in the creation\nof a new column of light through which\nyou can access Eldin Province.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_006	Based on the song from the goddess\nstatue within {color[0003]}Skyview Temple{color[ffff]},\nthere is a 97% chance {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} has\nheaded for {color[0000]}Eldin Province{color[ffff]}.\nI recommend {color[0004]}diving{color[ffff]} into the {color[0000]}column\nof light {color[ffff]}that leads to the Eldin\nProvince.\n\nThe column of light you seek is\npositioned to the north of {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_007	Based on the song from the goddess\nstatue heard within {color[0003]}Skyview Temple{color[ffff]},\nthere is a 90% probability that {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} is \nnow in {color[0003]}Eldin Province{color[ffff]}.\nTo ascertain Zelda's whereabouts as\nquickly as possible, it will be most\neffective to look for local life-forms\nwho may have seen her pass by.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_008	Judging by the discussions of the\nMogmas you met on {color[0003]}Eldin Volcano{color[ffff]},\nI infer that {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} has been taken by a\nmonster to the temple on the volcano.{[010c|000600d0]}
KEN2_008_1	You are currently looking for the {color[0000]}key\nto open the temple door{color[ffff]}. This key\nhas been split into five pieces which can\nbe located with your {color[0004]}dowsing{color[ffff]} ability.{[010c|00060128]}

KEN2_009_1	The probability of recovering Zelda\nunharmed is decreasing rapidly.\nYou must find her as soon as possible.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_009_2	Unfortunately, she has now been led\naway by an unknown individual and\nhas already moved to another area.\n\nAs you did at {color[0003]}Skyview Spring{color[ffff]},\nI recommend seeking guidance from\nthe goddess statue located within\nthe {color[0003]}Earth Spring{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_010	Based on information from the\ngoddess statue within the {color[0003]}Earth\nTemple{color[ffff]}, there is a 90% probability that\n{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} has headed to {color[0000]}Lanayru Province{color[ffff]}.\nI advise you to take the {color[0000]}tablet {color[ffff]}you just\nacquired and place it in the {color[0000]}altar\n{color[ffff]}housed within the {color[0003]}Statue of the\nGoddess {color[ffff]}in {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.{color[0003]} \n{color[ffff]}Doing so should bring forth a new\ncolumn of light through which you can\naccess Lanayru Province.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_011	Based on information from the\ngoddess statue within the {color[0003]}Earth\nTemple{color[ffff]}, there is a 90% probability that\n{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} has headed to {color[0000]}Lanayru Province{color[ffff]}.\nI recommend {color[0004]}diving{color[ffff]} into the {color[0000]}column\nof light {color[ffff]}that leads down to Lanayru\nProvince.\n\nThe column of light you seek is\npositioned to the southwest of {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_012	Based on information from the\ngoddess statue within the {color[0003]}Earth\nTemple{color[ffff]}, there is a 90% probability that\n{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} has headed to {color[0000]}Lanayru Province{color[ffff]}.\nTo ascertain Zelda's whereabouts as\nquickly as possible, it will be most\neffective to look for local life-forms\nwho may have seen her pass by.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_013	You are currently searching for the\nentrance to {color[0003]}Lanayru Mining Facility {color[ffff]}so\nthat you can reach the {color[0000]}Temple of Time{color[ffff]},\nwhere {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} is currently located.\nI recommend utilizing your map\nwhile in {color[0003]}Lanayru Desert {color[ffff]}to ascertain\nthe position of the mining facility.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_014	There is an 85% probability that {color[0003]}Zelda\n{color[ffff]}has headed to the {color[0003]}Temple of Time {color[ffff]}in\nthe western region of {color[0003]}Lanayru Desert{color[ffff]}.\n\nHer objective is currently unknown,\nbut I recommend that you hurry to the\nTemple of Time as well, {[0112|00000002]}Master.\n\nAs the temple gate is currently\nunusable, the only way into the temple\nis through {color[0003]}Lanayru Mining Facility{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_015	Based on what the unidentified person\nwith {color[0003]}Zelda {color[ffff]}in the {color[0003]}Temple of Time {color[ffff]}said,\nspeaking with the old woman in the\nSealed Grounds may aid your search.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_016	To reach Zelda, you must enhance your\nsword using the {color[0000]}sacred flames {color[ffff]}of the\nthree provinces.\n\nEvidence suggests the Ballad of the\nGoddess, which has been known in\n{color[0003]}Skyloft {color[ffff]}for generations, may hold a\nclue to the location of these flames.\nAnalysis indicates your best course of\naction is to search Skyloft and learn\nwhat you can of this song.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_017	The lyrics of the Ballad of the Goddess\nthat you heard from {color[0003]}Gaepora{color[ffff]} mention\ndirecting the {color[0000]}two great whirling sails\ntoward the Light Tower{color[ffff]}.\nThat tower stands in {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}'s plaza.{[010c|000600d9]}
KEN2_017_1	Although the meaning of this phrase is\nunclear, I recommend that you search\naround Skyloft for two things that\ncould be construed as whirling sails.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_017_2	Although a connection with the two\nsails is not 100% certain, it is clear that\na {color[0000]}propeller {color[ffff]}from a Skyloft windmill\nhas fallen below the clouds.\nI recommend you look for a way to\nretrieve this propeller.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_017_3	Although a connection with the two\nsails is not 100% certain, it is clear that\na {color[0000]}propeller {color[ffff]}from a Skyloft windmill\nhas fallen below the clouds.\nIt is possible to locate the propeller\nusing your {color[0004]}dowsing {color[ffff]}ability.\n\n\nOnce you have located it, you can\nget the robot you reactivated in the\nScrap Shop to carry it back to\nSkyloft for you.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_017_4	There is an 80% chance that one of\nthe {color[0000]}two whirling sails{color[ffff]} we seek is the\nwindmill repaired by {color[0003]}Jakamar{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_017_5	Although a connection with the two\nsails is uncertain, there is an 85%\nchance that the object you just found\nis a {color[0000]}propeller{color[ffff]} from a Skyloft windmill.\nI recommend guiding the robot from\nthe Scrap Shop back to Skyloft while\nhe carries the alleged propeller.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_017_6	By rotating the windmills to face the\nLight Tower, you have revealed a\nstructure hidden atop the tower.\nI advise you to investigate it.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_018	The Light Tower situated in the Skyloft\nplaza currently projects a powerful\nbeam of light into the distance toward\na fixed point.\nI have determined with 80% certainty\nthat the secrets alluded to within the\nBallad of the Goddess are hidden at the\npoint where that light is focused.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_019	To reach {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, you must enhance your\nsword using the {color[0000]}sacred flames {color[ffff]}of the\nthree provinces.\n\nTo accomplish this, I recommend you\nuse your {color[0004]}dowsing{color[ffff]} ability to locate the\nplace in {color[0003]}Faron Woods {color[ffff]}that responds to\nthe guiding song of {color[0000]}Farore's Courage{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}

KEN2_021	According to the Kikwi hermit, {color[0003]}Yerbal{color[ffff]},\nthe {color[0003]}Water Dragon{color[ffff]} guards a {color[0000]}sacred\nflame {color[ffff]}that will enhance your sword.\n\nYou require more information on the\nflame. To obtain it, you will need to\nspeak with the Water Dragon who\nresides at the bottom of the lake.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_022	To reach {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, you must enhance your\nsword using the {color[0000]}sacred flames {color[ffff]}of the\nthree provinces.{[010c|000600de]}
KEN2_022_1	To learn the location of the sacred\nflame in {color[0003]}Faron Province{color[ffff]}, you must find\n{color[0005]}sacred water{color[ffff]} for the Water Dragon.\n\nI have registered the sacred water as\na target you can now search for using\nyour {color[0004]}dowsing {color[ffff]}ability.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_022_2	The entrance to the place that holds\n{color[0000]}Farore's Flame{color[ffff]}, one of the sacred\nflames, has been opened by the\nWater Dragon.\nIt is very likely that a great number of\nmonsters infest this place, so I highly\nrecommend you equip yourself\nproperly for a hostile environment.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_023	To reach {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, you must enhance your\nsword using the {color[0000]}sacred flames {color[ffff]}of the\nthree provinces.\n\nThe Water Dragon stated that {color[0000]}Farore's\nFlame{color[ffff]}, one of the sacred flames, can be\nfound in the {color[0003]}Ancient Cistern{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_024	Now that a sacred flame has enhanced\nyour sword, I estimate a 90% chance\nthat returning to the {color[0003]}Isle of Songs{color[ffff]} will\nyield new guidance from the goddess.\nI recommend you follow the beam of\nlight being projected from the Light\nTower back into the {color[0003]}thunderhead{color[ffff]} and\nreturn to the Isle of Songs.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_025	To reach {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, you must enhance your\nsword using the {color[0000]}sacred flames {color[ffff]}of the\nthree provinces.\n\nTo obtain the sacred gift that will\nenable you to find the second sacred\nflame, I recommend you head for the\n{color[0000]}trial{color[ffff]} in {color[0003]}Lanayru Desert{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_026	To reach {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, you must enhance your\nsword using the {color[0000]}sacred flames {color[ffff]}of the\nthree provinces.{[010c|000600e2]}
KEN2_026_1	There is a 96% chance that you can \nreach new locations within {color[0003]}Lanayru\nProvince{color[ffff]} using the {color[0005]}Clawshots{color[ffff]} you got\nfrom the {color[0000]}trial {color[ffff]}in the {color[0003]}Lanayru Desert{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_026_2	Using the {color[0005]}Clawshots{color[ffff]}, you have managed\nto enter the {color[0003]}Lanayru Sand Sea{color[ffff]}.\nI suggest you search the area for\nclues leading to the next sacred flame.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_027	It would seem pirates have stolen the\nvessel of a robot captain in the {color[0003]}Lanayru\nSand Sea{color[ffff]}. The {color[0000]}sacred flame{color[ffff]} you seek is\nalso on board.{[010c|000600e3]}
KEN2_027_1	To take back the ship, you will first\nneed to travel to {color[0003]}Skipper's Retreat{color[ffff]}\nand obtain a sea chart.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_027_2	I advise you to take the sea chart\nyou've obtained back to the robot\ncaptain.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_028	Your current objective is to search\nthe {color[0003]}Lanayru Sand Sea {color[ffff]}for the ship\nthat is said to contain the next {color[0000]}sacred\nflame {color[ffff]}that will enhance your sword.\nAccording to the skipper of this stolen\nship, there is a good chance you can\nacquire information about the ship\nat the Lanayru {color[0003]}Shipyard{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}

KEN2_030	Your current objective is to search\nthe {color[0003]}Lanayru Sand Sea {color[ffff]}for the ship\nthat is said to contain the next {color[0000]}sacred\nflame {color[ffff]}that will enhance your sword.\nI estimate an 85% chance that the\nvessel you seek sails the sand sea.\nUse your {color[0004]}dowsing{color[ffff]} ability to locate and\npursue this ship.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_031	To reach {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, you must enhance your\nsword using the {color[0000]}sacred flames {color[ffff]}of the\nthree provinces.\n\nThe likelihood of the second sacred\nflame being housed in the {color[0000]}Sandship{color[ffff]}\nthat sails the {color[0003]}Lanayru Sand Sea{color[ffff]} is 95%.\n\nI advise you to search the interior\ncompartments of the vessel for the\nsacred flame.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_032	Now that a sacred flame has enhanced\nyour sword, I estimate a 90% chance\nthat returning to the {color[0003]}Isle of Songs{color[ffff]} will\nyield new guidance from the goddess.\nI recommend you follow the beam of\nlight being projected from the Light\nTower back into the {color[0003]}thunderhead{color[ffff]} and\nreturn to the Isle of Songs.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_033	To reach {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, you must enhance your\nsword using the {color[0000]}sacred flames {color[ffff]}of the\nthree provinces.\n\nTo obtain the sacred gift that will\nenable you to find the third sacred\nflame, I suggest you seek out the {color[0000]}trial\n{color[ffff]}on {color[0003]}Eldin Volcano{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_034	To reach {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, you must enhance your\nsword using the {color[0000]}sacred flames {color[ffff]}of the\nthree provinces.\n\nThere is a 95% chance that you can \nreach new areas within {color[0003]}Eldin Province\n{color[ffff]}using the {color[0003]}Fireshield Earrings {color[ffff]}you got\nfrom the {color[0000]}trial {color[ffff]}on {color[0003]}Eldin Volcano{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_035	Your current objective is to search\nEldin Province for the third sacred\nflame that will enhance your sword.\n\nThere is a strong possibility that this\nflame is housed in the large structure\nyou discovered, but the entrance is\nblocked by a wall of flames.\nBased on my projections, in order to\nextinguish the fire you will need a large\namount of {color[0000]}water{color[ffff]} and a {color[0000]}vessel{color[ffff]} in which\nto transport it.\nYou should focus your efforts on\nsecuring these items.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_036	Your current objective is to search {color[0003]}Eldin Volcano {color[ffff]}for\nthe final {color[0000]}sacred flame {color[ffff]}that will enhance your sword.{[010c|000600ec]}
KEN2_036_1	To extinguish the wall of fire blocking\nyour path beyond the summit, you need\nto transport the giant {color[0000]}water basin {color[ffff]}used\nby the Water Dragon.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_036_2	I've confirmed a very large structure\npositioned atop the volcano's summit.\nI recommend you explore it.{[010c|00060128]}

KEN2_038	There is a 95% probability that the \n{color[0000]}Gate of Time{color[ffff]} in the {color[0003]}Sealed Temple{color[ffff]}\nwill lead to {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}'s current location.\n\nI recommend you activate the Gate of\nTime using the power of your newly\nenhanced sword.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_039	At present, your most urgent priority is\nsealing away the unidentified monster\nthat is attempting to rouse itself.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_040	The giant monster that appeared in\nthe {color[0003]}Sealed Grounds {color[ffff]}has been\ndriven back into captivity again.\n\nMy assessment is that this creature\nposes no additional threat for the\nmoment.{[010c|000600f0]}
KEN2_040_1	The time has finally come to awaken\nthe {color[0000]}Gate of Time {color[ffff]}using the power of\nyour enhanced sword. I suggest you\nmake this your immediate priority.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_040_2	{[0112|00000001]}Master, you have now passed through\nthe {color[0000]}Gate of Time{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nProceed forward. I calculate a 99%\nprobability that {color[0003]}Zelda {color[ffff]}waits just ahead.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_041	{[0112|00000001]}To achieve your destiny and keep the\npromise you made to Zelda, you must\nvanquish {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}. \n\nTo accomplish this task, you will need\nto find and obtain the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_042	Master, {[0112|00000002]}you must now find the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}\nin order to vanquish {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nI strongly recommend that you search\nfor information about the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}\nwithin {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_043	There is an 80% probability that you\ncan get information about the {color[0002]}Triforce\n{color[ffff]}from {color[0003]}Levias{color[ffff]}, the great spirit of the\nskies.{[010c|000600f3]}
KEN2_043_1	{color[0003]}Instructor Owlan {color[ffff]}knows a great deal\nabout Levias. I recommend that you\nask him for more information about\nthis great spirit.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_043_2	However, in order to aid Levias,\nyou will need to learn the {color[0004]}Spiral\nCharge {color[ffff]}flight maneuver from\n{color[0003]}Instructor Owlan{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_044	There is an 80% probability that you\ncan get information about the {color[0002]}Triforce\n{color[ffff]}from {color[0003]}Levias{color[ffff]}, the great spirit of the\nskies.{[010c|000600f4]}
KEN2_044_1	There is an 85% chance that talking\nwith the owner of the Lumpy Pumpkin\nwill yield information that will aid\nyour search for Levias.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_044_2	I calculate a 90% chance that {color[0003]}Levias\n{color[ffff]}will appear if you take him an\noffering of the {color[0005]}pumpkin soup {color[ffff]}he\nenjoys consuming.\nTo this end, I suggest you take the\npumpkin soup to the small island with\nthe {color[0000]}rainbow{color[ffff]} inside the {color[0003]}thunderhead{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_044_3	However, Levias is behaving in a highly\naggressive manner. It is impossible to\ntalk with him in this state.\n\nI suggest you utilize the Spiral Charge\nto dislodge the foreign objects\nattached to him.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_045	In order to acquire the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}, the\npower that will allow you to vanquish\n{color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}, you must first complete the\nSong of the Hero.\nYour urgent task is to learn the\ndifferent parts of the song from the\nthree dragons who preside over the\nthree different provinces of the land.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_046	In order to acquire the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}, you\nmust first meet with the three dragons\nof the land and complete the {color[0000]}Song of\nthe Hero{color[ffff]}.{[010c|000600f8]}
KEN2_047	In order to acquire the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}, you\nmust first meet with the three dragons\nof the land and complete the {color[0000]}Song of\nthe {color[0000]}Hero{color[0000]}{color[ffff]}.{[010c|000600f8]}

KEN2_048_1	You have learned two parts of the {color[0000]}Song\nof the {color[0000]}{color[0000]}Hero{color[0000]}{color[0000]}{color[ffff]}. Your next move should be\nto seek out the dragon who rules over\n{color[0003]}Lanayru Province{color[ffff]} as fast as possible.\n{[0100|ffff]}And after that?{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN2_048_2	You have learned two parts of the {color[0000]}Song\nof the {color[0000]}{color[0000]}Hero{color[0000]}{color[0000]}{color[ffff]}.

KEN2_048_3	You have learned one part of the {color[0000]}Song\nof the {color[0000]}{color[0000]}Hero{color[0000]}{color[0000]}{color[ffff]}. To find the other parts,\nseek out the dragons who rule over the\n{color[0003]}Eldin and Lanayru Provinces{color[ffff]}.\n{[0100|ffff]}And after that?{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN2_048_4	You have learned two parts of the {color[0000]}Song\nof the {color[0000]}{color[0000]}Hero{color[0000]}{color[0000]}{color[ffff]}.

KEN2_048_5	You have learned one part of the {color[0000]}Song\nof the {color[0000]}{color[0000]}Hero{color[0000]}{color[0000]}{color[ffff]}.

KEN2_048_6	You have learned one part of the {color[0000]}Song\nof the {color[0000]}{color[0000]}Hero{color[0000]}{color[0000]}{color[ffff]}.

KEN2_048_8	When you have collected three parts\nof the Song of the Hero, return to\nthe great sky spirit, {color[0003]}Levias{color[ffff]}, and\ncomplete the Song of the Hero.\nIf the information you've gathered is\naccurate, doing this will open the path\nto the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}.\n\nShould you go on to successfully obtain\nthe {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}, you must use its power to\nvanquish {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}.\n\nThis is not only your ultimate goal but\nalso your destiny, {[0112|00000002]}Master.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_049	You have learned the three parts of the\n{color[0000]}Song of the Hero{color[ffff]} guarded by the\ndragons who reside on the surface.{[010c|000600f9]}
KEN2_049_1	I recommend returning to {color[0003]}Levias{color[ffff]}, the \ngreat sky spirit, to hear the final part\nand complete the Song of the Hero.\n{[0100|ffff]}And after that?{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN2_049_2	I infer the completed Song of the\nHero will open a path to the Triforce.\n\n\nShould you go on to successfully obtain\nthe {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}, you must use its power to\nvanquish {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}.{[0112|00000002]} \n\nDoing so is your ultimate goal and your\ndestiny, {[0112|00000002]}Master.
KEN2_050	You are currently searching for the\n{color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}, which has the power to\nvanquish {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}.\n\nUtilize your {color[0004]}dowsing{color[ffff]} ability with the\n{color[0000]}Song of the Hero {color[ffff]}to find the fourth\n{color[0000]}Trial Gate{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_051	{[0112|00000002]}Master, the {color[0000]}{[0201|00b4]} {color[ffff]}you\nreceived on completion of the final\ntrial is part of a pair.\n\nI infer that the matching second stone\nis somewhere within Skyloft. There is a\n90% chance that finding this stone will\nget you one step closer to the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_052	{color[0003]}Ghirahim{color[ffff]} has abducted Zelda and fled\ninto the past with her. You must chase\nafter him as quickly as possible.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_053	{color[0003]}Ghirahim{color[ffff]} has abducted Zelda and fled\ninto the past with her. You must chase\nafter Zelda as quickly as possible.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_054	{color[0003]}Ghirahim{color[ffff]} has used the power of {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}'s\nsoul to revive {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}. I'm afraid\nto report that further analysis of the\nsituation is impossible.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_070	{color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]} has once again broken the\nseal that binds him in an attempt to\nfree himself and return to full power.\n\nIf you fail to beat back this monster\nand gain more time to search for the\nTriforce, I estimate you have less than\na 1% chance of completing your quest.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_090	I project that the soil in {color[0003]}Lanayru\nProvince{color[ffff]} will not provide enough\nnourishment for the Life Tree\nSeedling to grow and produce {color[0000]}fruit{color[ffff]}. \nIn order to obtain this fruit, which the\nThunder Dragon seeks, you must find a\nplace to plant it where the tree can\ngrow strong {color[0000]}over many long years{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_091	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I recommend you take the\n{color[0000]}Life Tree Fruit {color[ffff]}to the Thunder Dragon\nin {color[0003]}Lanayru Province{color[ffff]}. \n\nI project a 90% chance that the\nThunder Dragon will agree to teach\nyou his {color[0000]}part of the Song of the Hero\n{color[ffff]}if the fruit restores him to health.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_092	{[0112|00000001]}Master, your primary objective is to\ndefeat the enemy here and overcome\nthe grueling task the Thunder Dragon,\n{color[0003]}Lanayru{color[ffff]}, has set before you.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_093	You are currently searching for a \n{color[0000]}sacred flame {color[ffff]}in {color[0003]}Eldin Province {color[ffff]}that \nwill enhance and augment your sword.\n\nYou have found a structure that is\nhighly likely to contain the sacred\nflame, but the entrance is blocked\nby a wall of flame.\nThere is an 80% chance that you will\nneed the Water Dragon's {color[0000]}tub {color[ffff]}to\nsuccessfully extinguish the flames.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_094	Although details are currently unclear,\nI have detected a massive disturbance\nin the vicinity of the great pit in the \n{color[0003]}Sealed Grounds{color[ffff]}.\nYou must carry out the task the old\nwoman has asked of you and deal\nwith it.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_095	I calculate a 99% probability that the\n{color[0002]}Triforce {color[ffff]}is somewhere in the structure\nthat appeared at the base of the Isle of\nthe Goddess.\nThe {color[0002]}Triforce {color[ffff]}has power capable of\nvanquishing {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}. I recommend a\nthorough exploration of this\nstructure's interior areas.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_096	Current Session Play Time: {color[0000]}{[0203|0000000002cd]}：{[0203|0000000102cd]}{color[ffff]}\nTotal Play Time: {color[0000]}{color[0000]}{[0203|0000000202cd]}{color[0000]}：{[0203|0000000302cd]}{color[ffff]}\nThis concludes my analysis.
KEN2_097	{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}'s presence seems to have\nvanished. I recommend a sweep \nof the area.{[010c|00060128]}
KEN2_098	I lack the data required to perform an\naccurate analysis of the current\nsituation.

KEN3_011	Your current location is {color[0003]}Lanayru\nDesert{color[ffff]}. I have detected the presence\nof multiple electrically charged\nmonsters in the region.\nAlso, you should beware of sinksand\nin desert areas.
KEN3_012	This is {color[0003]}{color[0003]}Lanayru{color[0003]} Mining Facility{color[ffff]}.\nReadings indicate it is populated with\nelectrically charged monsters.\n\nAlso, I detect the presence of ancient\nsecurity measures, though they now\nappear to be in disrepair.
KEN3_013	This is the {color[0003]}Lanayru Sand Sea{color[ffff]}.\nAnalysis suggests a healthy population\nof electricity-generating and fire-\nproducing life-forms.
KEN3_014	This is the {color[0003]}Sandship{color[ffff]} of the {color[0003]}{color[0003]}Lanayru{color[0003]}\nSand Sea{color[ffff]}. \n\n\nSome of the monsters that attacked\nthis ship are said to wield large\namounts of electrical energy.

KEN3_020	This is {color[0003]}Skyview Temple{color[ffff]}. I have\ndetected a powerful, hostile\naura in the local area.\n\nI project that this enemy possesses\na very high intelligence. It will\nlikely employ a variety of cunning\nattacks.
KEN3_021	This is the {color[0003]}Earth Temple{color[ffff]}. There is a\npowerful, hostile aura nearby.\n\n\nWatch for {color[0003]}Bomb Flowers {color[ffff]}in this area.\nThey explode in reaction to various\nforms of stimuli.
KEN3_022	Your current location is {color[0003]}Lanayru\nMining Facility{color[ffff]}. Analysis suggests\na powerful, highly hostile enemy\nnearby.\nAlso, the floor of this room is covered\nin a thick layer of sand, within which\nmonsters may be lurking.
KEN3_023	These are the {color[0003]}Sealed Grounds{color[ffff]}.\nThe aura of a powerful and extremely\nhostile monster fills the entire area.\n\nI have no details on this monster as of \nyet, but the battlefield is quite large,\nso monitor your {color[0000]}stamina gauge\n{color[ffff]}closely.
KEN3_024	These are the {color[0003]}Sealed Grounds{color[ffff]}.\nThe aura of a powerful and extremely\nhostile monster fills the entire area.\n\nI have no details on this monster as of \nyet, but the battlefield is quite large,\nso monitor your {color[0000]}stamina gauge\n{color[ffff]}closely.
KEN3_025	These are the {color[0003]}Sealed Grounds{color[ffff]}.\nThe aura of a powerful and extremely\nhostile monster fills the entire area.\n\nI have no details on this monster as of\nyet, but I project that the mechanism\ncreated by {color[0003]}Groose{color[ffff]} will prove effective.
KEN3_026	You are currently located in the\n{color[0003]}Ancient Cistern{color[ffff]}. The aura of an\nextremely powerful and hostile\nmonster pervades the area.\nMovement is restricted by the rows of\ncolumns. I highly suggest you use your\nsuperior dexterity to evade enemy\nattacks.
KEN3_027	You are currently standing on the deck\nof the {color[0003]}Sandship{color[ffff]}. The aura of an\nexceptionally strong monster\npervades the area.\nTake care not to accidentally tumble\noverboard, as there is nothing but\nocean surrounding the vessel.
KEN3_028	This is the {color[0003]}Fire Sanctuary{color[ffff]}. Readings\nindicate an extremely hostile aura\nin the area.\n\nMy analysis of this aura leads me to\nconclude that this foe is highly\nintelligent. He will likely employ\na variety of cunning attacks.
KEN3_029	We are inside the {color[0003]}thunderhead{color[ffff]}.\nAnalysis reveals a parasitical monster\non the great spirit of the sky, Levias,\nhas caused him to go mad.\nWhen in combat, be careful of strong\nwinds and unstable footholds.
KEN3_030	These are the {color[0003]}Sealed Grounds{color[ffff]} of the\npast. I detect an extremely powerful\nand exceptionally hostile aura in the\nimmediate area.\nAura analysis has revealed that this\nfoe is highly intelligent. He will likely\nemploy a variety of cunning attacks.
KEN3_031	I have no record of this place.\nI sense no hostile auras other\nthan {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}.\n\nMy projections indicate your current\nlocation is a unique space under the\ncontrol of {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}'s magic. {color[0000]}I do not\nbelieve {color[ffff]}{color[0000]}Skyward Strikes are possible{color[ffff]}.
KEN3_032	This is a subterranean corridor that\nlinks {color[0003]}Lanayru Mining Facility {color[ffff]}to the\n{color[0003]}Temple of Time{color[ffff]}.\n\nI detect no monsters here, so I project\nthe probability you will engage in\ncombat here is under 5%.

KEN3_038	In this area of {color[0003]}Sky Keep{color[ffff]}, there are\nmany complicated contraptions.\n{[0112|00000002]}Master, your wisdom will be tested\nhere.
KEN3_039	You are currently located in {color[0003]}Sky Keep{color[ffff]}.\nThe pathway here is too narrow\nto dodge enemy attacks.\n\nI recommend making good use of your\n{color[0004]}shield bash{color[ffff]}, as I project it will be\ndifficult to find heart-replenishment\nopportunities.
KEN3_040	You are located inside {color[0003]}Sky Keep{color[ffff]}.\nNo monsters exist here, though I infer\nexploring this area will not be easy.\n\nTo aid you, {[0112|00000001]}Master, I will increase\nanalytical granularity and provide\n{color[0000]}situational analysis for each section{color[ffff]}.
KEN3_042	These are the {color[0003]}Lanayru Caves{color[ffff]}. I detect\nno monsters in the area.
KEN3_043	This is {color[0003]}Eldin Volcano{color[ffff]}. You will likely\nencounter a limited number of\nmonsters here that are capable of\nshooting fire arrows from a distance.\nIn the alarming event you catch on\nfire, you can extinguish yourself using\na {color[0004]}roll or spin attack{color[ffff]}.
KEN3_044	This is {color[0003]}Skyview Temple{color[ffff]}. I detect an\nincrease in the number of hostile auras\nwithin the structure since our last visit.\nDo not let your guard down.

KEN3_100	My projections indicate that equipping\na sword is sufficient for combat at\nthis location.\n\nYou could also consider stocking your\npouch with helpful items.
KEN3_101	You are sufficiently equipped to\nexplore this area. You can safely swap\na portion of the combat-oriented pouch\nitems for other support pouch items.
KEN3_102	In the bazaar, you can use Rupees\nand treasures dropped by defeated\nmonsters to buy and upgrade items.
KEN3_103	Pouch items that focus on heart\nreplenishment are unnecessary in this\narea. I recommend removing non-\ncombat pouch items.
KEN3_104	Be prepared to engage monsters that\nattack in hordes.
KEN3_105	Use of your limited supply of pouch\nitems should be avoided when possible.
KEN3_106	Certain monsters will drop treasure\nupon defeat, but I would discourage\nyou from taking any unnecessary risks\nwhen seeking treasure in this fashion.
KEN3_107	There is little here that will put your\nlife in danger. I recommend using this\nopportunity to sharpen your sword\ntechniques in smaller battles.
KEN3_108	The structure of this enclosed space\nwill hamper the speed with which you\ndiscover monsters, increasing the\nchance of unexpected damage to 75%.\nI recommend keeping a large quantity\nof potions with you.
KEN3_109	Your life should not be in danger as\nlong as you avoid engaging multiple\nenemies in combat.
KEN3_110	Your current selection of pouch items\ndoes not sufficiently protect you.\nI recommend carrying defensive and\nhealth-replenishing pouch items.
KEN3_111	My projections indicate the danger to\nyour life will be limited if you remain\ncalm and engage monsters confidently.\n\nUse your health-replenishing items\nsparingly.
KEN3_112	Use of weapons and items is not\npossible underwater. You must\nprotect yourself by other means.
KEN3_113	Analysis indicates use of your current\nselection of items will be limited due to\nthe large sections of this area that\nare underwater.
KEN3_114	Analysis indicates use of your current\nselection of items will be limited due to\nthe large sections of this area that\nare underwater.
KEN3_115	You cannot use weapons and items\nunderwater. If your hearts are low,\nsearch for a place where you can get\nout of the water and recuperate.
KEN3_116	Your pouch items are suitable to this\nenvironment, but caution is advised\ndue to the presence of airborne,\nland-dwelling, and marine monsters.
KEN3_117	Your current selection of pouch items\nis highly suitable for this environment.\n\n\nYou will be able to respond to a wide\nrange of circumstances. This is ideal\nfor a facility as complex as this one.
KEN3_118	Analysis indicates a large number of\nmonsters with varying characteristics.\n\n\nYou will need to prepare a suitable\nloadout of pouch items and adapt to\ncircumstances as you proceed.
KEN3_119	You are somewhat prepared for this\narea, but due to the presence of air,\nland, and aquatic enemies, I suggest\nyou exercise caution.
KEN3_120	You will not be able to use items and\nweapons while underwater. Search for\nother ways to defend yourself.
KEN3_121	I recommend keeping {color[0005]}Air Potions{color[ffff]}\nor {color[0005]}Heart Potions{color[ffff]} handy in case of\noxygen depletion and any resulting\nheart loss.
KEN3_122	I recommend keeping {color[0005]}Air Potions{color[ffff]}\nor {color[0005]}Heart Potions{color[ffff]} handy in case of\noxygen depletion and any resulting\nheart loss.
KEN3_123	Your selection of pouch items is highly\nsuited to this environment. However,\nyou will not be able to use pouch items\nwhile underwater.
KEN3_124	You will sustain injury when your\nclothes are set on fire. I recommend\ncarrying sufficient recovery items\nin your pouch.
KEN3_125	I project a high probability that you\nwill sustain damage from both\nmonsters and magma.\n\nI recommend carrying recovery and\ndefensive items in your pouch.
KEN3_126	With your current selection of items,\nI estimate an 85% chance of serious\nhealth loss before finding treasure or\nRupees.
KEN3_127	There is minimal danger when you\nare set on fire by an enemy attack,\nprovided you react calmly and quickly.
KEN3_128	You will continue to take damage while\nyour clothing is on fire. I recommend\ncarrying plenty of recovery items in\nyour pouch.
KEN3_129	Even minor injuries can become life\nthreatening if you sustain enough of\nthem. Remain cautious.
KEN3_130	It would be dangerous to continue\nexploring this area with your current\npouch items. I recommend you carry\nrecovery and defensive pouch items.
KEN3_131	There is minimal danger when you\nare set on fire by an enemy attack,\nprovided you react calmly and quickly.
KEN3_132	You will continue to take damage while\nyour clothing is on fire. I recommend\ncarrying plenty of recovery items.
KEN3_133	Even minor injuries can become life\nthreatening if you sustain enough of\nthem. Remain cautious.

KEN3_135	There is minimal danger when you\nare set on fire by an enemy attack,\nprovided you react calmly and quickly.
KEN3_136	When you are affected by a {color[0000]}curse{color[ffff]}, you\nwill be unable to use your sword and\nshield for a short time.\n\nIn the event that you become cursed,\nI highly recommend you retreat from\nthe area.
KEN3_137	The layout of the sanctuary is quite\ncomplex. It will be less dangerous to\nexplore in stages, frequently returning\nto {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]} to rest and resupply.
KEN3_138	My projections indicate you may have\ndifficulty fighting with the pouch\nitems you are carrying.\n\nI highly recommend that you save\nyour progress whenever you encounter\na {color[0000]}bird statue{color[ffff]}.
KEN3_139	You are equipped to handle the loss of\na few hearts, but you must remain\ncautious. There are a large number\nof strong foes in the area.
KEN3_140	It is possible to attack {color[0003]}Bokoblins{color[ffff]}\npositioned on towers and high ground\nusing your {color[0000]}bow{color[ffff]} and {color[0000]}bombs{color[ffff]}.\n\nYour chance of a successful attack is\nhigher if you strike before you are\nnoticed.
KEN3_141	{color[0003]}Bokoblins{color[ffff]} are constructing a fortress\non high ground. I recommend\nemploying weapons with\nlong-range attack capability.
KEN3_142	You are carrying mostly noncombat\nitems in your pouch, so I currently\nproject a 65% probability that you will\nencounter difficult combat conditions.\nI recommend making sure you are\nfully equipped to handle long-range\nattack capability.
KEN3_143	Most of the enemies in this area are\n{color[0003]}Bokoblins{color[ffff]}, so I project you are in\nlittle danger of running out of hearts.\n\nAttack is the best defense here.
KEN3_144	Monsters can appear without warning.\nYou will need to be ready to switch\nbetween your sword and other\nweapons at a moment's notice.
KEN3_145	{color[0003]}Lanayru Province{color[ffff]}, our current\nlocation, is vast in size. I recommend\ncareful rationing of items that do\nnot regenerate themselves.
KEN3_146	You are not well suited to this\nenvironment. I recommend avoiding\nunnecessary combat.
KEN3_147	Your gear is suitable for this vast\ndesert environment. You should be\nable to explore relatively safely.
KEN3_148	There are many monsters in this area\nthat can attack from a distance.\nBe prepared to lose hearts.
KEN3_149	You are equipped to adapt to a\nvariety of circumstances.\n\n\nHowever, the possibility of trouble\nwill increase if you alter your current\nbalance of pouch items.
KEN3_150	Because of the significant number of\npowerful enemies in the area, I highly\nrecommend carrying pouch items that\nfocus on recovery and defense.
KEN3_151	You are carrying a number of\npouch items that are ineffective in\nbattle. This may lead to the unplanned\nconsumption of recovery pouch items.
KEN3_152	It will be difficult to explore the vast\n{color[0003]}Lanayru Sand Sea {color[ffff]}with only combat-\nfocused items in your pouch.\n\nYou'll need to take measures to\npreserve and recover hearts when\nnecessary.
KEN3_153	Your preparations for preserving and\nrecovering hearts are insufficient. If\nyou want to proceed as is, be cautious\nin both exploration and combat.
KEN3_154	The {color[0003]}Lanayru Sand Sea{color[ffff]} is quite vast.\nI recommend prioritizing equipment\nthat will help preserve and recover\nhearts.
KEN3_155	Your gear is more suited to this area\nthan other types. Prioritize heart\npreservation when exploring the\n{color[0003]}{color[0003]}Lanayru{color[0003]} Sand Sea{color[ffff]}.
KEN3_156	The inside of the ship features many\nsmall rooms and corridors. Close\ncombat is expected, so take equipment\nthat mitigates heart depletion.
KEN3_157	Your pouch-item loadout can adapt\nwell to many scenarios, but you can\nincrease suitability by 10% by adding\ndamage-mitigating pouch items.
KEN3_158	The inside of the ship has narrow\ncorridors where combat cannot be\navoided. I project you will lose a\nnumber of hearts in this area.
KEN3_159	Your pouch items correctly focus on\ndefense and recovery. Be aware, \nthough, that close combat will likely be\nunavoidable in the ship's corridors.
KEN3_160	Analysis shows close combat will\nbe frequent here. Equipment suited to\nlong-range combat will be ineffective.\nYou will need hearts for the assault.
KEN3_161	My projections indicate you are likely\nto be injured in combat because you\nwill be traversing a number of narrow\nplatforms here.\nI recommend carrying pouch items that\nare ideal for defense and heart\nrecovery.
KEN3_162	My projections indicate you are likely\nto be injured in combat because you\nwill be traversing a number of narrow\nplatforms here.\nI recommend carrying pouch items that\nare ideal for defense and heart\nrecovery.
KEN3_163	Analysis indicates this place is home to\nhordes of monsters. If you encounter\nthem, I suggest employing heart-\nrecovery and preservation measures.
KEN3_168	I detect no particular danger here.
KEN3_176	Monster numbers here are unknown.\nYou may find yourself in danger if you\ndo not have adequate defensive and\nrecovery capabilities.
KEN3_177	You do not have enough {color[0005]}Heart Potions{color[ffff]}.\nI recommend you do whatever is\nnecessary to obtain every single {color[0005]}heart\n{color[ffff]}that a monster drops.
KEN3_178	Monster numbers here are unknown.\nYou may find yourself in danger if you\ndo not have adequate defensive and\nrecovery capabilities.
KEN3_179	Monster numbers here are unknown.\nEquipment that will assist you with\nhearts may be the best choice.
KEN3_180	I cannot offer my usual analysis\nbecause you are currently engaged in\na challenge created by the Thunder\nDragon Lanayru.
KEN3_181	I do not have any relevant information\nto report at this time.
KEN3_182	In this area, pouch items that enhance\nlong-distance weapons, such as the\nbow, will be most effective.
KEN3_183	You have a high probability of\nsustaining injury when you approach\nmonsters that shoot fire arrows. Carry\nhealth-recovery pouch items.
KEN3_184	You could be ambushed by fire-arrow-\nshooting monsters at any time.\nI suggest using items that allow you\nto deal swiftly with these monsters.
KEN3_185	You have a high probability of\nsustaining injury when you approach\nmonsters that shoot fire arrows. Only\na few potions may not be enough.
KEN3_200	To make matters worse, your Wooden\nShield is not well suited to defend you\nfrom fire-based attacks.{[0104|000f]} I do not\nrecommend that you equip it.
KEN3_201	Furthermore, your Iron Shield will not\ndefend you against electrical attacks.{[0104|000f]}\nI do not recommend that you use it.
KEN3_300	{[0112|00000001]}Master, your current selection of\npouch items is {[0202|00000000]}.

KEN3_501	Suitability to current location is {[0203|0000000000cd]}%.
KEN3_600	Your offensive options are limited\nwhile battling with this monster.\n\n\nI recommend carrying more recovery\npouch items and potions to ensure\neffectiveness.
KEN3_601	My analysis suggests you should\nattempt to anticipate your opponent's\nmoves and react quickly.\n\nHowever, I suggest focusing on defense\nrather than offense because of the lack\nof recovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_602	My analysis reveals that you will be\nmuch more prepared for this area if\nyou increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_603	In a situation where a monster utilizes\nseveral types of attacks, you are likely\nto take significant damage until you\nfully understand their strategy.\nI recommend doing what you can to\npreserve your hearts while you focus\non quickly analyzing attack patterns.
KEN3_604	You will be able to mount an aggressive\nassault on your opponents with the\ncurrent high proportion of combat\nitems in your pouch.\nHowever, your ability to recover is\nlimited, so you should avoid taking\ndamage whenever possible.
KEN3_605	You have plenty of recovery and\nattack pouch items. If you utilize them\neffectively, you will have an 80%\nchance of success in the battle.\nHowever, {[0112|00000002]}Master, you must still be\nvery careful. This monster has superior\noffensive and defensive capabilities.
KEN3_606	My analysis indicates you will be better\nsuited to engaging this enemy in battle\nif you increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_607	I theorize that ascertaining this\nmonster's pattern of attack should\nbe comparatively easy.\n\nHowever, your stock of pouch items\nthat allow you to attack this enemy is\nlimited. As such, there is a 75% chance\nthis battle will drag on.
KEN3_608	There is a 90% probability that the\nmajority of your weaponry will be\nineffective against your current foe.\n\nTaking sufficient heart-recovery\nmeasures will be vital for the lengthy\nbattle that is likely to ensue.
KEN3_609	I calculate an 80% probability that the\nbattle will drag on due to your limited\noffensive options and relatively small\nwindows for attack.\nMy analysis suggests that you should\nremove any pouch items not needed\nfor battle.
KEN3_610	My analysis indicates you will be better\nsuited to engaging this enemy in battle\nif you increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_611	I calculate an 80% probability that the\nbattle will drag on due to your limited\noffensive options and relatively small\nwindows for attack.\nSince you are likely to sustain a lot of\ninjuries, finding the right moment to\nrecover hearts will be critical.
KEN3_612	The efficient use of pouch items will\ngive you quite an advantage.\n\n\nIt is probable that you will eventually\nhave to engage in direct combat.\nWhen your hearts are low, you should\ntake appropriate precautions.
KEN3_613	You currently carry a mixture of\nuseful and suboptimal pouch items.\n\n\nI recommend a careful assessment of\nthe pouch items you are carrying.
KEN3_614	My analysis indicates you will be better\nsuited to engaging this enemy in battle\nif you increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_615	The monster is attempting to leave the\nconfines of the {color[0003]}Sealed Grounds {color[ffff]}and\nhead out into the land.\n\nYou have a limited time frame in which\nto imprison it. Doing so may force you\nto put yourself in harm's way, so be\nprepared to sustain some damage.
KEN3_616	The aura of the monster here is\noverwhelmingly powerful. Do not rely\non the support pouch items to be\nparticularly effective in your battle.
KEN3_617	You currently carry a mix of useful\nand suboptimal pouch items.\nI recommend you remove items that\ndo not directly serve your purposes.
KEN3_618	My analysis indicates you will be better\nsuited to engaging this enemy in battle\nif you increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_619	The monster is attempting to leave the\nconfines of the {color[0003]}Sealed Grounds {color[ffff]}and\nhead out into the land.\n\nYou have a limited time frame in which\nto imprison it. Doing so may force you\nto put yourself in harm's way, so be\nprepared to sustain some damage.
KEN3_620	I have detected the aura of an\nextremely powerful monster.\n\n\n{[0112|00000002]}Master, my analysis has revealed\nsomething troubling. Neither your\nsword nor your items will likely be\nvery effective against this enemy.
KEN3_621	I have concluded that the majority\nof the items in your pouch will be\nineffective during your battle against\nthis monster.\nThe monster itself appears to be\nevolving, growing larger and more\npowerful with each moment.
KEN3_622	My analysis indicates you will be better\nsuited to engaging this enemy in battle\nif you increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_623	This monster is overwhelmingly\npowerful. It will not be effective to\nchallenge it directly in your current\nstate and with the sword you wield.\nI recommend reevaluating and\nchanging your entire fighting style.
KEN3_624	You have a limited number of effective\noffensive options. The probability\nthat your battle equipment will be\ncompletely ineffective is 90%.\nThere is also a great danger that your\nheart-recovery pouch items will be\ninsufficient, which may prove lethal if\nyou are unable to end the fight quickly.
KEN3_625	You currently carry a mix of useful\nand suboptimal pouch items.\n\n\nI recommend you remove items that\ndo not directly serve your purposes.
KEN3_626	My analysis indicates you will be better\nsuited to engaging this enemy in battle\nif you increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_627	I calculate an 80% probability that the\nbattle will drag on due to your limited\noffensive options and relatively small\nwindows for attack.\nMy analysis indicates you are likely to\nincur significant damage, so finding\nthe right time to recover hearts will be\nimperative.
KEN3_628	Your current selection of pouch items\nwill prove useful in this battle to some\ndegree but aren't absolutely necessary.\n\nAccording to my analysis, {[0112|00000001]}Master,\ngiven your current combat capabilities,\nyou are free to carry other types of\npouch items should you wish to do so.
KEN3_629	Your pouch items represent the bare\nminimum required for attack, defense,\nand recovery. Consider choosing a\nbetter selection of pouch items.\nIf you decide to continue with\nyour present configuration, please\nbe extremely vigilant during battle.
KEN3_630	My analysis indicates you will be better\nsuited to engaging this enemy in battle\nif you increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_631	You are equipped to withstand the\nmonster's fierce offensive capabilities\nto a limited degree.\n\nYou are not, however, at the optimal\nlevel of safety, so take full advantage\nof any chance to damage your foe.
KEN3_632	Your opponent is highly intelligent and\nhas powerful offensive capability.\n{[0104|000f]}The probability of achieving victory\nwith the help of support items is 5%.\nDirect attack methods are judged\nto have the best chance of inflicting\ndamage.
KEN3_633	You are not carrying many items in\nyour pouch that will aid you in battle.\n\n\nMy analysis shows you lacking in\npouch items that aid in defense and\nheart recovery.
KEN3_634	My analysis indicates you can increase\nyour suitability to this environment\nby increasing the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_635	In a situation where a monster utilizes\nseveral types of attacks, you are likely\nto take significant damage until you\nfully understand its strategy.\nI recommend doing what you can to\npreserve your hearts while you focus\non quickly analyzing its attack pattern.
KEN3_636	You are carrying a number of items\nin your pouch that will be of little to\nno use in this location.\n\nBe careful not to lose too many hearts.
KEN3_637	In the event you battle with this\nmonster, you will have a limited\nnumber of effective offensive\nmeasures at your disposal.\nI recommend maintaining a supply of\nrecovery pouch items and potions to\nensure survivability.
KEN3_638	My analysis indicates you can increase\nyour suitability to this environment\nby increasing the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_639	Analysis shows that the parasite\ninhabiting {color[0003]}Levias{color[ffff]} has relatively poor\noffensive capabilities. As such, I judge\nthe probability of defeat at 30%.\nHowever, the danger to you will\nincrease significantly if the battle\nbecomes drawn out.
KEN3_640	Your opponent is highly intelligent\nand has powerful attacks.{[0104|000f]} The\nprobability of achieving victory with\nthe help of support items is 5%.\nDirect attack methods will be most\neffective at defeating this opponent.
KEN3_641	The contents of your pouch are of\nlimited use.\n\n\nMy analysis of your pouch items\nreveals the need for more items that\nwill increase your defense and\nheart-recovery capability.
KEN3_642	My analysis indicates you will be better\nsuited to engaging this enemy in battle\nif you increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_643	In a situation where a monster utilizes\nseveral types of attacks, you are likely\nto sustain significant damage until you\nfully understand its strategy.\nI estimate an 80% chance that your\ncurrent battle will be a prolonged one.\n\n\nMy analysis of these conditions\nindicates that keeping an abundance of\nrecovery items in your pouch will\nimprove your chances of survival.
KEN3_644	Your opponent is highly intelligent and\nhas superior combat techniques. The\neffectiveness of the items currently\nin your pouch is estimated at 10%.\nI infer that in order to inflict damage,\nyou must break your opponent's guard\nwith superior technique, then make a\ndirect attack while his guard is down.
KEN3_645	When your opponent's defenses are set,\nthere is an increased chance of taking\ndamage while you master the method\nfor breaking his guard.\nI also surmise that your present\nequipment does not have enough\nmeans for recovering health.\n
KEN3_646	My analysis indicates you will be better\nsuited to engaging this enemy in battle\nif you increase the proportion of\nrecovery items in your pouch.
KEN3_647	When your opponent's defenses are set,\nthere is an increased chance of taking\ndamage while you master the method\nfor breaking his guard.\nI recommend continuously\nreplenishing health as you test various\nattacks in an attempt to break through.
KEN3_700	I have confirmed the presence of\na variety of monsters in the vicinity. \n\n\nIf you effectively utilize weapons other\nthan your sword, I calculate an 80%\nchance of gaining the advantage in\nbattle.
KEN3_701	You don't need additional battle and\nrecovery pouch items. Using these\npouch items efficiently will increase\nyour probability of survival by 50%.
KEN3_702	There is an increased probability of\nobtaining treasure here because of the \nunusual variety of monsters.\n\nHowever, you should expect more-\nchallenging battles, and it will be\nmore difficult to find health-\nreplenishment items.
KEN3_703	Your selection of pouch items focuses\non recovery and damage reduction.\n\n\nHowever, be aware that there will\nbe little time to recover your health\nwhen you are fighting multiple enemies\nat once.
KEN3_704	There are complex contraptions here.\nYour effectiveness at dealing with\nthese devices increases when you\nare carrying the proper pouch items.
KEN3_705	Your current selection of pouch items\nallows you to adapt to a variety of\ncircumstances.
KEN3_706	Some types of treasure can only\nbe obtained from certain monsters.\nThere is a chance to obtain one such\nkind of rare treasure at this location.
KEN3_707	You cannot use your pouch items\nwhen underground. If you want to \nconsume a potion, you will need to\nreturn to the surface.
KEN3_708	Signs indicate you can expect many\nopportunities to use long-range\nweapons at this location.\n\nYou can boost your chance of success\nagainst the various puzzles and devices\nof this area by carrying an abundant\nsupply of ammunition.
KEN3_709	Your selection of pouch items is highly\nsuited to this environment, especially\nwhen compared with other, more\nunbalanced gear choices.\nHowever, due to the unique terrain,\nit may still be difficult to advance.\nExpect significant trouble here.
KEN3_710	At this location, you can expect\nsignificant difficulty simply advancing.\n\n\nTherefore, it is recommended that\nyou refrain from collecting treasure\nand Rupees and instead focus on the\ntask at hand.
KEN3_711	I cannot confirm the presence of\nespecially dangerous monsters at\nthis location.\n\nI conjecture that it is sufficient to be\nprepared for the possibility of injury\ncaused by falling into molten lava.
KEN3_712	When ancient monsters enter the\nTimeshift Orb's area of effect, there\nis a danger they will reanimate and\nimmediately attack you.\nIf this occurs while transporting the\nTimeshift Orb, put the orb down and\nready yourself for battle as quickly as\npossible.
KEN3_713	Your suitability should further\nincrease if you give priority to\nrecovery pouch items over battle\npouch items.
KEN3_714	When ancient monsters enter the\nTimeshift Orb's area of effect, there\nis a danger they may revive and attack\nyou.\nI recommend you carry ample\nsurvivability and defense pouch items.
KEN3_715	When ancient monsters enter the\nTimeshift Orb's area of effect, there\nis a 95% probability that they will\nreanimate and immediately attack you.
KEN3_716	When ancient monsters enter the\nTimeshift Orb's area of effect, there\nis a danger they will reanimate and\nimmediately attack you.\nIf this occurs while transporting the\nTimeshift Orb, put the orb down and\nready yourself for battle as quickly as\npossible.
KEN3_717	Danger is dramatically increased when\nattempting to manipulate a device\nwhile simultaneously engaging\nenemies.\nFirst, eliminate as many enemies as\npossible, then approach the mechanism\nin question.
KEN3_718	When ancient monsters enter the\nTimeshift Orb's area of effect, there\nis a danger they will reanimate and\nimmediately attack you.\nI recommend you carry ample\nsurvivability and defense items.
KEN3_719	When ancient monsters enter the\nTimeshift Orb's area of effect, there\nis a danger they will reanimate and\nimmediately attack you.
KEN3_720	Regardless of your current selection\nof pouch items, I do not calculate a\nsignificant difference in your chances\nof success.\nHowever, using projectiles here will\nimprove your effectiveness.
KEN3_721	Your current pouch items allow you\nto adapt to a variety of circumstances.\n\n\nHowever, these pouch items will not\ndirectly help you overcome the\ncontraptions set here.
KEN3_722	Due to your mediocre suitability\nrating in this location, I suggest you\nproceed with caution.\n\nBefore dealing with any puzzles or\nmechanisms in this area, I recommend\ndefeating all nearby monsters.
KEN3_723	Your preparations for heart recovery\nare sufficient.\n\n\nHowever, as the surrounding terrain is\nprecarious and forces you to move\nthrough the air at great heights, I\nrecommend you use extra caution here.
KEN3_724	There is a 10% probability that you\nwill need to use battle items from\nyour pouch in the present location.\n\nWhen your hearts are running low,\nI recommend collecting more from\nthe surrounding {color[0003]}heart flowers{color[ffff]}.
KEN3_725	The contents of your pouch are far \nfrom optimal. Instead, I recommend \nyou prepare for the possibility of \ndramatic heart depletion.
KEN3_726	At the present location, you should not\nexpect to find treasure or Rupees.\n\n\nTo safely explore this area, I suggest\nequipping yourself to deal with rapid\nheart depletion.
KEN3_727	Your current selection of pouch items\nallows you to recover from some\ninjuries.\n\nHowever, I recommend making good\nuse of your {color[0004]}shield bash{color[ffff]}, as it may be\ndifficult to find time for recovery \nif you are attacked.

KEN5_208_1	She is currently dreaming about\nmeeting her ideal male companion.
KEN5_208_2	{[0112|00000001]}Master, your interest in this young\nwoman is clear. I can see your aura\nshine bright with joy in her presence.\n\n...I strongly recommend you do not\nmention this when you next encounter\n{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}.
KEN5_209	Her name is {color[0003]}Luv{color[ffff]},{[0104|0002]} and she is a big\nproponent of eating and sleeping.\n\n\nShe runs the Potion Shop with her\nhusband, who mixes and infuses\npotions. She is in charge of sales.

KEN5_212	This is {color[0003]}Pipit{color[ffff]},{[0104|0002]} a talented and highly\nenthusiastic student at the Knight\nAcademy. He is your classmate,\n{[0112|00000001]}Master.\nHe serves as lookout around {color[0003]}Skyloft\n{color[ffff]}after dark, when it often becomes\nvery dangerous.
KEN5_213	His name is {color[0003]}Fledge{color[ffff]}, {[0104|0002]}and he was once a\nweak and helpless individual. He is also\nyour classmate at the Knight Academy,\n{[0112|00000001]}Master.\nAfter working out continuously, he has\nbuilt a muscular physique that allows\nhim to easily throw heavy pumpkins up\ninto the air without tiring.
KEN5_214	This is the hand of a ghost.{[0104|000f]} Identity\nwhile alive is unknown. Judging from\nthe look of this hand, the probability\nthat it was a young girl's is 90%.\n{[0112|00000001]}Master, the letter you gave her from\n{color[0003]}Cawlin {color[ffff]}has inspired feelings for him.\nThe ghost's original purpose for the \nletter is still unclear.
KEN5_215	Name and other information are\nunknown, but signs indicate that\nthis individual is extremely aged.\n\nI can verify that she has a strong\napprehension of impending crisis with\nregard to the giant monster in this area\nthat is trying to free itself.
KEN5_216	Her name is {color[0003]}Faron{color[ffff]},{[0104|0002]} the Water Dragon.\nAs the great protector of {color[0003]}Faron\nProvince{color[ffff]}, she has power over water.\n\nHowever, she seems to have lost her\npower for the moment.

This female\nwarrior was tasked by the goddess with\nthe mission of protecting Zelda.\nShe is mildly injured. There is a 98%\nprobability that she sustained an injury\nfrom {color[0003]}Ghirahim{color[ffff]}, who passed through\nhere recently.
KEN5_218	His name is {color[0003]}Guld{color[ffff]}. He was once the\nleader of the Mogmas.\n\n\nHe has passed that role on to the next\ngeneration and taken it upon himself\nto start a second life tending to a\npumpkin patch.
KEN5_219	That is {color[0003]}Lanayru{color[ffff]},{[0104|0002]} the Thunder Dragon.\nAs the great protector of {color[0003]}Lanayru\nProvince{color[ffff]}, he has power over lightning.\n\nHe is suffering from a severe ailment\nthat could present a great danger if\nleft untreated.
KEN5_221	Its designation is {color[0003]}LD-301S Scrapper{color[ffff]}.{[010c|000601f5]}
KEN5_221_1	This robot was handed down among\nthree generations of Scrap Shop\nproprietors. It is currently damaged\nand not functional.\nThe current Scrap Shop owner, {color[0003]}Gondo{color[ffff]},\nhas been trying to fix it, but he lacks\nthe necessary materials.
KEN5_221_2	This is an ancient robot repaired by\n{color[0003]}Gondo{color[ffff]}, the Scrap Shop owner.\n\n\nBecause it can freely travel between\nthe sky and the ground below, this\nunit's function is to transport various\nobjects.\nApparently, it is highly interested in\nmy approval.

KEN6_000	Target lock: {color[0003]}Remlit (Day){color[ffff]}{color[0003]}{[010c|00060259]}{color[ffff]}
KEN6_000_1	These small creatures inhabit {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.\nThey have friendly dispositions during\nthe day, but can become aggressive at\nnight. Approach with caution.
KEN6_000_2	These small animals dwell in {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.\nDue to {color[0003]}Batreaux{color[ffff]}'s transformation into\na human, they no longer exhibit\naggressive tendencies at night.
KEN6_001	Target lock: {color[0003]}Remlit (Night) {color[ffff]}{color[0003]}{color[0003]}{[010c|0006025a]}{color[0003]}{color[ffff]}
KEN6_001_1	During the day they are quite docile,\nbut after dark their personality turns\naggressive and they will attack. Don't\nbe fooled by their cute appearance.
KEN6_005	Target lock: {color[0003]}Bilocyte{color[ffff]}{[010c|0006025d]}
KEN6_005_0	This species of parasite is currently\nattached to {color[0003]}Levias{color[ffff]}. It is known for its\nenormous optical structure.\n\nThis horrifying life-form utterly\ncontrols the mind and body of its host.{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_005_1	My analysis indicates the projectiles\nspit by the {color[0003]}Bilocyte {color[ffff]}can be {color[0000]}repelled{color[ffff]}\nby your sword, {[0112|00000002]}Master.\n\nFurthermore, I infer that repelling the\nBilocyte's own projectiles back toward\nit could become a very effective means\nof attack.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_005_2	Based on the creature's anatomy,\nit is probable that this monster's\nweakness is its central {color[0000]}eye{color[ffff]}.\n\nHowever, I can confirm that while the\n{color[0000]}fins{color[ffff]} on the sides of its head are\nextended, any attack on the {color[0000]}eye {color[ffff]}will be\nquite ineffective.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more.{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_005_3	In order to effectively hit the Bilocyte\nby repelling its projectiles, you must\nconsider the direction in which you are\nswinging your sword.\nBy swinging left and right, you can\ncontrol the direction of the deflection.\n{[0104|000f]}Swinging up or down will deflect\nprojectiles straight back.
KEN6_005_4	This is all the information I have at\nthe present time.\n\n\nWhen I have more information to\nreport, {[0112|00000002]}Master, your sword will flash.\nYou can always press {[0204|11cd]} to call on me.{[0111|09cd]}\n\nFurthermore, when you require\ninformation about your equipment or\nyour surroundings, please select\n{color[0000]}Analysis{color[ffff]}.
KEN6_006	Target lock: {color[0003]}Walltula{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nFound mostly in ivy and on walls, you\ncan expect this creature to approach\nwhen it senses your presence.\n\nThe beast lives on other creatures'\nbodily fluids. A fully grown Walltula\nis several orders of magnitude more\ndangerous than a young Walltula.
KEN6_007	Target lock: {color[0003]}Skulltula{color[ffff]}{[010c|000602bb]}
KEN6_007_2	This giant species of spider inhabits the\ndeepest areas of forests. It attacks\nwith highly adhesive webbing in order\nto prevent its prey from escaping.\nIt has a tough outer carapace, but its\nstomach may be vulnerable to attack.\n\n\nI am currently conducting additional\nanalysis into its movement patterns.
KEN6_007_3	This giant species of spider inhabits the\ndeepest areas of forests. It attacks\nwith highly adhesive webbing in order\nto prevent its prey from escaping.\nIt has a tough outer carapace, but its\nstomach may be vulnerable to attack.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_007_4	I have observed that it has a tendency\nto move with its back toward its prey\nto prevent its weak point from being\nexposed.\nTherefore, you must find a way to flip\nthe beast over to access its weak point.
KEN6_007_5	I have observed that it has a tendency\nto move with its back toward its prey\nto prevent its weak point from being\nexposed.\nTherefore, you must find a way to flip\nit over to attack its weak point.\n{[0100|ffff]}Anything else?{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_007_6	Its lone weak point is the center of its\nabdomen, but it is surrounded by tough\nchitin. This leads me to conclude that a\n{color[0004]}fatal blow{color[ffff]} will be most effective.
KEN6_008	Target lock: {color[0003]}Aracha{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis larval monster is said to live for\n1,000 years, during which time it is\ncontinually growing.\n\nThough the larva is small in size, it is\nquite ferocious and is often found in\nswarms beneath the sand.\n\nIt tends to leap toward moving objects\nsuch as yourself.
KEN6_010	Target lock: {color[0003]}Moldarach{color[ffff]}{[010c|00060262]}
KEN6_010_0	An {color[0003]}Aracha{color[ffff]} that has survived its very\nlengthy larval stage is known as a\n“Thousand-Year Arachnid," which\nis precisely what you see before you.\nOver 90% of its body is shielded by a\ntough, chitinous armor that can deflect\neven the sharpest blade.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more.{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_010_1	The {color[0000]}weak points {color[ffff]}are its overdeveloped\npincers, but you must hit each at the\nright angle relative to the pincer's \nposition to be effective.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more.{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_010_2	This beast has a tendency to bury itself\nin the sand when it feels its health\nis endangered.\n\nWhen it is burrowed below the sand,\nyou can expect at least an 85% chance\nthat it will attempt to stab you with\nits tail.\nI highly recommend removing the\ncreature's environmental advantage\nby {color[0000]}blowing away {color[ffff]}sand, thereby\nrevealing its position.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_010_3	Analysis reveals that the creature's\n{color[0000]}central eye {color[ffff]}will be vulnerable to\nattack once its pincers have been\nproperly disposed of.\nI calculate a near 100% chance that\nan assault on this weak point will \nultimately prove quite fatal.\n\nHowever, I infer from the armor\nsurrounding the {color[0000]}central eye {color[ffff]}that\nhorizontal, vertical, and diagonal\nslashes will be entirely ineffective.
KEN6_011	Target lock: {color[0003]}Keese{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nFound in many locations, these winged\nmonsters are attracted to dark places,\nsuch as caves.\n\nThey often gather in colonies, are \nactive at night, and sleep in the day.\nThose who come too close and awaken\nthem often fall victim to attack.
KEN6_012	Target lock: {color[0003]}Dark Keese{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nFound in many locations, these winged\nmonsters are attracted to dark places,\nsuch as caves.\n\nThey often gather in colonies, are \nactive at night, and sleep in the day.\nThose who come too close and awaken\nthem often fall victim to attack.
KEN6_013	Target lock: {color[0003]}Thunder Keese{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nFound in desert habitats, these winged\nmonsters are attracted to dark places,\nsuch as caves. Their internal organs\ngenerate electricity for attacking prey.\nThey often gather in colonies, are \nactive at night, and sleep in the day.\nThose who come too close and awaken\nthem often fall victim to attack.
KEN6_014	Target lock: {color[0003]}Fire{color[ffff]}{color[0003]} Keese{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nFound near volcanoes, these monsters\nare attracted to dark places, such as\ncaves. Constantly under combustion,\nthey will burn anything on contact.\nThey often gather in colonies, are \nactive at night, and sleep in the day.\nThose who come too close and awaken\nthem often fall victim to attack.
KEN6_015	Target lock: {color[0003]}Guay{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis bird seemingly jettisons its\ndroppings upon people's heads on\npurpose. It is unclear if this is due to a\ncarefree attitude or pure malice.\nShould its droppings land on you,\nI calculate the probability of your\nintense aggravation at 100%.
KEN6_016	Target lock: {color[0003]}Furnix{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis spirit bird is said to survive by\neating flames. Due to its cautious\nnature, it can be difficult to approach.\n\nHowever, by catching and holding the\nbird's attention, some are able to\nsuccessfully attack it. I suggest being\nwary of its curled tail.
KEN6_017	Target lock: {color[0003]}Hrok{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis great bird is remarkable for its\nswollen, red throat. It also ingests\nminerals contained in rocks.\n\nThe small stones it is not able to fully\ndigest are collected in its throat,\nwhich it can then amalgamate and\nregurgitate as fully formed boulders.
KEN6_018	Target lock: {color[0003]}Red Bokoblin{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThese monsters have plagued the land\nsince ancient times. They each play\ndifferent roles, and their weaponry\nvaries. They prefer to act in groups.\nNone of them are intelligent by any\ndefinition of the word. Curiously, they\nseem to have a mysterious obsession\nwith fashionable undergarments.
KEN6_019	Target lock: {color[0003]}Red Bokoblin (Leader){color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nAs a symbol of its leadership, this\ncreature wraps a cloth around its head.\nThis visually communicates that it is\nmore dominant than other Bokoblins.\nIt can call its underlings to arms\nusing its horn.
KEN6_020	Target lock: {color[0003]}Blue Bokoblin{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis is a dangerous form of Bokoblin.\nMy analysis suggests it is many times\nstronger than a Red Bokoblin.\n\nIts skin and clothing differ due to its\nhailing from a different environment,\nbut it still has the same fixation with\nexotic undergarments.
KEN6_028	Target lock: {color[0003]}Technoblin{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThese Bokoblins wield sophisticated\nweaponry created by an ancient\nand highly evolved civilization.\n\nIf you are struck with the discharge\nfrom one of their electrical weapons,\nyou may become paralyzed.\n\nThese creatures also wear the latest in\nBokoblin fashion.
KEN6_029	Target lock: {color[0003]}Red Bokoblin (Archer){color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThese are Red Bokoblins that carry\nbows capable of knocking down distant\ntargets.\n\nThough not obvious from their outward\nappearance, their aim is quite deadly.
KEN6_036	Target lock: {color[0003]}Wooden Shield Moblin{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis massive monster's wall-sized\nshield gives it a tactical advantage.\nWhen its shield is at the ready, most\nattacks will be quite futile.\nThe destruction of its shield is likely to\ndrive the monster into a rage, instantly\nincreasing its threat.
KEN6_037	Target lock: {color[0003]}Metal Shield Moblin{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis Moblin has a sturdy iron shield.\nOnly a few Moblins are capable of\ncarrying a large, heavy shield of iron\nlike this one.\n{[0112|00000002]}I calculate an 85% chance that you can\n{color[0000]}climb over {color[ffff]}that large shield as if it\nwere a wall.
KEN6_038	Target lock: {color[0003]}Green Bokoblin{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis variety of Bokoblin enjoys dark\nplaces, such as caves. Its sunlight-\ndeficient lifestyle has turned its skin\na stomach-turning shade of green.\nHowever, like its red brethren, it\nexhibits a fascination with festive\nundergarments.
KEN6_039	Target lock: {color[0003]}Green Bokoblin (Archer){color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis variety of Bokoblin inhabits caves\nor indoor environments. It has archery\nskills roughly equivalent to the\nsurface-dwelling Red Bokoblin.\nAlso similar to the surface-dwelling\nRed Bokoblin, the Green Bokoblin\nobsesses about stylish undergarments.
KEN6_041	Target lock: {color[0003]}Lizalfos{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis unmistakable monster is equipped\nwith an arm guard made of hard iron.\nGreat physical prowess makes it\ndifficult to predict its movements.\nYou will need to anticipate the\ndirection of its arm guard to\nsuccessfully land an attack on the\nexposed angle.
KEN6_042	Target lock: {color[0003]}Dark Lizalfos{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis beast has superb fighting skills\nand uses an iron arm guard. Watch for\nquick counterattacks when your\nattacks are repelled{[0112|00000001]}, Master.\nThe creature's breath can cause a curse\nthat will prevent you from using your\nsword, so I recommend exercising\nextreme caution.
KEN6_043	Target lock: {color[0003]}Cursed Bokoblin{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis horrifying Bokoblin reanimates\nafter death. Analysis indicates it fears\npure, shiny items and will {color[0000]}startle at\nthe sight of a sacred shield{color[ffff]}.\nIt is able to reanimate purely through\nits hatred of this world...and its\nattachment to outlandish underpants.
KEN6_044	Target lock: {color[0003]}Staldra{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis is a snake monster from before\nthe dawn of time.{[0104|000f]} Three bone-plated\nheads and a thirst to cause pain keep\nit writhing even beyond death.\nMy analysis shows that to defeat this\ncursed snake, all three of its heads\nmust be simultaneously destroyed.
KEN6_045	Target lock: {color[0003]}Stalfos{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis skeleton soldier is born of the\ndead. In its previous life, it was an\nordinary knight, but undeath has\nimproved its combat abilities.\nIt is possible to overpower it with\na well-timed {color[0004]}shield bash {color[ffff]}during the\ncreature's attack.
KEN6_046	Target lock: {color[0003]}Stalmaster{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis is an elite captain of the undead\nsoldiers. When provoked, it has the\nability to strike with all four of its\nsword-wielding arms.\nI recommend inflicting damage\nwhen the slight gap presents itself\nas it readies its swords to attack.
KEN6_047	Target lock: {color[0003]}LD-002S Scervo{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis mutinous robot stole this ship\nfrom Skipper long ago. He still\ncommands the ship today.\n\nWhen fighting in a narrow space like\nthis, it is more effective to use {color[0000]}thrust{color[ffff]}\nattacks with your sword than to try to\nswing your sword widely.
KEN6_048	Target lock: {color[0003]}Koloktos{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis “Ancient Automaton" defends\nthe {color[0003]}Ancient Cistern {color[ffff]}and eliminates\nintruders.{[010c|00060288]}
KEN6_048_0	The cursed energy supply Ghirahim\nprovided to this contraption has\ngiven it power far beyond its\nconventional limits.\nThe {color[0000]}red, orb-shaped cores {color[ffff]}embedded\nin its torso and arms provide it limited\nstability and prevent it from falling\nto pieces.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_048_1	It is highly probable that if the {color[0000]}red\ncores {color[ffff]}in its arms were to be ejected,\nthe unit would lose integrity and the\nlimbs would sever from the body.\nHowever, during normal operation the\ncores are likely hidden below the\nforearm plating.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_048_2	Results from my analysis show that the\n{color[0000]}red cores{color[ffff]} in Koloktos's arms will only\nbe revealed when the arms are\nstretched out to full length.\nFast and timely counterattacks after\nKoloktos swings its arms down have\nthe best chance of success.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_048_3	I estimate a high probability that the\n{color[0000]}red cores {color[ffff]}can be removed using your\n{color[0005]}whip{color[ffff]}.\n\nWhen Koloktos's arms lower, there\nwill be a brief moment when you can \nattack the {color[0000]}chest core{color[ffff]}. \n\nHowever, when targeting the {color[0000]}chest\ncore{color[ffff]}, there is nowhere to hook on to\nwith your {color[0005]}whip{color[ffff]}. Therefore, removing\nthe core will not be possible.
KEN6_049	Target lock: {color[0003]}Ghirahim{color[ffff]}{[010c|00060289]}
KEN6_049_A0	I have no confirmed information about\nthis man, other than he refers to\nhimself as a “Demon Lord."\n\nI sense a powerful and evil aura, and I\nestimate his level of ability as highly\nadept. However, according to analysis,\nhe has yet to reveal his true power.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_049_A1	Speech analysis indicates absolute\nconfidence in his own abilities.\n\n\n{[0112|00000002]}Master, you must watch for Ghirahim's\nability to grasp your sword with his\nbare {color[0000]}right hand{color[ffff]}.\n\nIt is highly probable that he observes\nthe {color[0000]}angle you hold your sword at{color[ffff]} and\nprepares his defense accordingly.\n\nI recommend attacking from the\ndirection opposite his hand.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}I'm ready.
KEN6_049_A2	Should he catch hold of your sword,\nI recommend swinging in the\n{color[0000]}direction Ghirahim's hand opens{color[ffff]}.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_049_A3	My analysis confirms that {color[0000]}Ghirahim{color[ffff]}'s \nfingers always point upward when\nhe holds {[0112|00000001]}your sword, Master.\n\nThe probability of escaping his grip\n{color[0000]}by swinging your sword upward{color[ffff]}\nis approximately 100%.
KEN6_049_B0	I have detected a change in Ghirahim's\nfighting style from the beginning of \nthe battle. \n\nI theorize that this change happened\nbecause of the small amount of damage\nhe sustained.{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_049_B1	Analysis indicates that the daggers\nGhirahim shoots will align on a single\nplane in one of three orientations:\nhorizontal, vertical, or diagonal.\nWith good timing, you might be able to\nrepel them with a single swing of your\nsword, but my judgment shows that this\nmaneuver will be difficult.{[0100|ffff]}Anything else?{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_049_B2	I can now confirm that Ghirahim has\nthe ability to teleport.\n\n\nFurther study reveals that he may be\nvulnerable immediately after\nteleportation. This is your chance to\nattack.\nHowever, be aware Ghirahim may use\nhis sword to guard against just such\nan attack.\n{[0100|ffff]}Anything else?{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_049_B3	Ghirahim will repeatedly move around\nyou, {[0112|00000002]}Master. I recommend {color[0000]}engaging{color[ffff]} \nhim with your sword as he makes his\nattack.\nIt is probable that the moment before\nGhirahim readies his attack, he will\nreveal the direction he will move\nas he attempts to flank you.\nIf you are unable to establish the\ncorrect timing to attack, I suggest\nusing your {color[0004]}spin attack{color[ffff]}.
KEN6_050	Target lock: {color[0003]}Ghirahim{color[ffff]}{[010c|0006028a]}
KEN6_050_A0	Ghirahim is the {color[0003]}Demon Lord {color[ffff]}leading\nthe monsters. He displays superior\nmental and physical prowess, as well\nas expert command of magic.\nThough possessing some gentleman-\nlike qualities, he will devolve to his\ntrue nature when enraged.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_050_A1	Analysis indicates that the daggers that\nappear around Ghirahim also act as a\ndefensive barrier.\n\nRemoving these daggers before\nattacking should be an effective means\nof breaking down his defenses.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_050_A2	It appears that Ghirahim prefers to\nuse his right hand to attempt to grab\nyour sword, {[0112|00000002]}Master.\n\nShould he succeed, I recommend\n{color[0000]}swinging your sword up and down\n{color[ffff]}to force him to release it.\n\nHowever, Ghirahim continues to utilize\nmore of his true power, and the\nprobability of it taking more than one\nswing to release your sword is 100%.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_050_A3	To land an attack on Ghirahim, I\nadvise you to swing your sword from a\ndirection that cannot be blocked by\ndaggers or Ghirahim's right hand.\nGhirahim will move his right hand\nin time with your attacks. However,\n{[0112|00000002]}Master, there will be times when {color[0000]}he is\ntoo slow to meet your attack{color[ffff]}.
KEN6_050_B0	I have detected a change in Ghirahim's\nfighting style since the beginning of\nthe battle.\n\nI have concluded that this change\nhappened because of the small amount\nof damage he sustained.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_050_B1	When Ghirahim shoots his daggers,\nI recommend repelling them by\nswinging your sword along the line\nthe knives are positioned in.\nLogically, if surrounded by daggers,\nusing {color[0000]}a sword technique that attacks in \nall directions {color[ffff]}would be effective.\n{[0100|ffff]}Anything else?{[0101|0000]}I'm ready.
KEN6_050_B2	There will be a significant opening for\ncounterattacks if you are able to avoid\nGhirahim's overhead attack when he\nteleports above your head.\nHe will teleport to places other than\nabove you, of course, but my analysis\nconfirms an interesting behavior\npattern.\nHe assumes different stances when he\nplans to teleport above you and when\nhe plans to go somewhere else.\n{[0100|ffff]}Anything else?{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_050_B3	I am confident Ghirahim will use his\nsword to defend against your attacks,\n{[0112|00000001]}Master.\n\nGhirahim wields two swords, so the\nprobability that he will block two of\nyour sequential attacks is 100%.
KEN6_051	Target lock: {color[0003]}Ghirahim{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis {color[0003]}Demon Lord {color[ffff]}leads the monster\nforces.{[010c|0006028b]}
KEN6_051_0	There is a 90% change in outward\nappearance compared to previous\nencounters with him. I detect a dark\naura emanating from his entire body.\nBe cautious, {[0112|00000001]}Master. This opponent is \nextremely dangerous and likely to\nfell you with a single blow.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more.{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_051_1	He is now revealing his true power.\nI am detecting a significant increase\nin muscular strength.\n\nUnfortunately, I must also conclude\nthat none of your weapons will be\neffective against him.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_051_2	Analysis indicates that attacks from\nyour sword {color[0000]}may drive Ghirahim back{color[ffff]},\nif ever so slightly, {[0112|00000001]}Master.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_051_3	I have noted that Ghirahim has a\ntendency to stand near the center of\nthe platform, {[0112|00000002]}Master.\n\nThere is an 85% probability he does\nthis to avoid falling off.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_051_4	{[0112|00000002]}Master, there is a 95% chance that\nGhirahim will attempt {color[0000]}to intercept\nyour sword {color[ffff]}in order to defend against\nyour attacks, just like last time.\nIf you notice a large change in his\nstance, take care to note the {color[0000]}position\nof his hand{color[ffff]}.
KEN6_052	Target lock: {color[0003]}The Imprisoned{color[ffff]}{[010c|0006028c]}
KEN6_052_0	I have insufficient data on this\nmonster.\n\n\nIts enormous size and ominous aura\ncannot be compared with previously\nencountered monsters.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_052_1	I can confirm that the {color[0000]}sealing spike\n{color[ffff]}observed at the top of its head is the\nsame object originally found in the\n{color[0003]}Sealed Grounds{color[ffff]}.\nI hypothesize that damage can be\ninflicted by driving the stone pillar\ninto the monster's head.\n\nBut first, I recommend attacking the\nbeast's feet—where your sword can\nreach—to stop it from moving.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_052_2	It is probable that the monster will be\nunable to move if you destroy all of\nits toes.\n\nI recommend using the air vents to\nmove ahead of the monster instead\nof chasing it from behind.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_052_3	If you are able to get between the\nmonster's toes, my analysis indicates\nyou can effectively inflict great\ndamage with a {color[0004]}spin attack{color[ffff]}.\nYou can also choose to decrease your\nrisk of physical harm by using {color[0005]}bombs{color[ffff]} to\nattack from a distance.
KEN6_053	Target lock: {color[0003]}The Imprisoned{color[ffff]}{[010c|0006028d]}
KEN6_053_0	There is insufficient data on this target\nto make a full report at this time.\n\n\nBut I can confirm the appearance of\nlimb-like appendages that were not\npreviously present. The evil power of\nthis creature has also increased.{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_053_1	Analysis indicates that you should be\nable to use the same basic strategy as in\nthe previous encounter to seal the\nmonster in its prison once more.\nThe fingers and toes on its limbs can be\ndestroyed with a physical attack, but\nyou should wait to do so until these\ntargets become a very high priority.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_053_2	I calculate a 100% probability that the\nlarge apparatus Groose constructed\nwill be effective against this\nmonster.\nIt is likely that a direct hit from this\napparatus will stop the monster's\nmovement, creating a window of\nopportunity for you to attack.{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_053_3	{color[0003]}Groose{color[ffff]}'s defense apparatus can be\nrepositioned by pushing {[0204|0ecd]}.\n\n\nWhen the monster is in your blind spot,\nI recommend you reposition the\napparatus and target the monster.
KEN6_054	Target lock: {color[0003]}The Imprisoned{color[ffff]}{[010c|0006028e]}
KEN6_054_0	Though the details are still unclear,\nthis monstrosity is the demonic vessel\nof {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}.\n\nI can confirm a previously unseen\ntaillike appendage.\n\n\nI recommend generous use of {color[0003]}Groose{color[ffff]}'s \ncatapult.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_054_1	You must attempt to seal this beast\naway again. I suggest a plan of attack\nsimilar to what you used in previous\nencounters.\nThe monster's fingers, like its toes, are\ncomparatively soft targets and can be\ndestroyed by physical attack.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_054_2	After toppling the monster, it is\npossible that the beast's enormous bulk\nmay prevent you from approaching\nthe {color[0000]}sealing spike{color[ffff]}.\nIn this scenario, I recommend that you\ndescend a level and use an air vent to\ntravel to the head of the monster.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_054_3	The monster has evolved to an\nimmensely powerful state. I calculate\nthe odds you will defeat it by sword\nalone at approximately 0%.\nI recommend you utilize Groose's\ndefense apparatus. As a last-ditch\nmeasure, you can launch {color[0000]}yourself{color[ffff]},\n{[0112|00000002]}Master, as a projectile.
KEN6_055	Target lock: {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}{[010c|0006028f]}
KEN6_055_0	This eternal being has conquered time\nitself. It is the source of all monsters.\n\n\nAccording to tales passed down through\ngenerations, it appears differently in\neach epoch and to each person who\nlays eyes on it.{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_055_1	It is highly probable that the only\nweapon capable of wounding Demise\nis the {color[0005]}Master Sword {color[ffff]}itself. No other\nweapon can affect him.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_055_2	The probability that a single, standard\nattack of yours will injure Demise,\n{[0112|00000002]}Master, is exactly 0%.\n\nA series of attacks that can overwhelm\nDemise's guard is required, such as\n{color[0000]}repeated slashing from various angles{color[ffff]}.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_055_3	Results from my analysis confirm that\nthe time to strike Demise is when he\nholds his sword aloft.\n\nHowever, vigilance is required.{[0104|000f]}\nAny attack falling near Demise's sword\nhas a 100% chance of being blocked.
KEN6_056	Target lock: {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}{[010c|00060290]}
KEN6_056_0	I can confirm it is possible for Demise\nto store the electrical energy of a\nlightning strike in his sword and use it\nto his advantage.\n{[0112|00000002]}Master, should your sword come into\ncontact with Demise's sword once it\nhas electrified, you will receive a\npainful shock.\nIt is essential that you time your\nattacks carefully. Very carefully.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more.{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_056_1	{[0112|00000002]}Master, I see no reason why you cannot\nmake use of the lightning strikes the\nsame way Demise does.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_056_2	It is possible to store lightning in the\n{color[0000]}Master Sword {color[ffff]}by raising your sword\nin the air as if you were readying a\n{color[0000]}Skyward Strike{color[ffff]}.\nWhen lightning strikes in the distance\nand the sky lights up, quickly raise\nyour sword skyward to call down the\nlightning.\nHowever, be aware that while you are\nattempting to be struck by lightning,\nyou will be leaving yourself open to\nDemise's attacks.
KEN6_056_3	I can confirm it is possible for Demise\nto store the electrical energy of a\nlightning strike in his sword and use it\nto his advantage.\n{[0112|00000002]}Master, should your sword come into\ncontact with Demise's sword once it\nhas electrified, you will receive a\npainful shock.{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more.{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_056_4	I need more time to complete my\nanalysis of Demise.\n\n\nIn a few moments, use {[0204|07cd]} to lock on to\nDemise, and then call me with {[0204|11cd]}.\nI will report my findings then.{[0111|07cd]}{[0111|09cd]}
KEN6_056_5	It is clear that {color[0000]}Skyward Strikes {color[ffff]}cannot\nbe called down to your sword because\nthis place is under the magical\ninfluence of Demise.\nAttacks using {color[0000]}Skyward Strike energy\n{color[ffff]}will not be possible here.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me more.{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_057	Target lock: {color[0003]}Octorok (Grass){color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis monster descended from oceanic\nmollusks. It has developed the\nunsightly ability to spit rocks.\n\nThe creature prefers to sleep with tufts\nof grass on its head, so it has learned to\ntake on the appearance of grass in\norder to fool and defeat its prey.\nYou can use a shield to bounce the\nrocks this monster spits back at it.
KEN6_058	Target lock: {color[0003]}Octorok (Rock){color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis monster descended from oceanic\nmollusks. It has developed the\nunsightly ability to spit rocks.\n\nInexplicably, this beast prefers to sleep\nwith rocks on its head. It camouflages\nitself to surprise and defeat its prey.\n\nYou can use a shield to bounce the\nrocks this monster spits back at it.
KEN6_059	Target lock: {color[0003]}Red Chuchu{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThe red Chuchu has an exceedingly\nhigh body temperature. Avoid all\nphysical contact, or your clothing\nand shield may burst into flames.\nIn the event you are set on fire,\nI recommend you quickly extinguish\nthe flames by performing a {color[0004]}roll{color[ffff]}.
KEN6_060	Target lock: {color[0003]}Blue Chuchu{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis is a rare, aquatic Chuchu. Known\nfor attaching itself to unaware victims,\nits gelatinous body will clog your air\npipe, literally taking your breath away.\nIt is exceedingly dangerous to allow\none of the larger specimens to stick\nto you for any length of time.
KEN6_061	Target lock: {color[0003]}Yellow Chuchu{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nYellow Chuchus are capable of\ngenerating electricity for short bursts\nof time. As with other Chuchus,\nI suggest you remain on guard.\nIf you make contact with this type of\nChuchu when it is charged, it will give\nyou a shock. Then it will attempt to\nfeed on you. This is not pleasant.
KEN6_062	Target lock: {color[0003]}Green Chuchu{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThese creatures prefer exceptionally\ndamp environments. They will\nencompass and digest anything they\ncan absorb into their gelatinous bodies.\nAs they have no genders,\nthey are believed to increase their\npopulation by dividing themselves\ninto several smaller-sized Chuchus.
KEN6_063	Target lock: {color[0003]}Pyrup{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis skittish monster prefers to hide\nin small holes or inside the skeletal\nremains of deceased creatures.\n\nOnce the cowardly Pyrup finds a small\nspace from which to spit flames, it\nbecomes unapproachable.\n\nYou will need to employ a clever\nstrategy to defeat it. {color[0000]}Inflicting damage\nfrom a distance may be the only way{color[ffff]}.
KEN6_065	Target lock: {color[0003]}Scaldera{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis fearsome monster inhabits the\ndeepest recesses of the {color[0003]}Earth Temple{color[ffff]}.\nIt can be categorized as a Pyroclastic\nFiend.{[010c|00060299]}
KEN6_065_0	Its body is completely covered in rock,\nbut you can see its weak point, the {color[0000]}eye{color[ffff]},\nthrough the cracks in this outer shell.\n\nIf you are able to remove parts of this\ncreature's rocky shell, you will vastly\nincrease your probability of success.{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_065_1	There is a 0% probability that your\nsword will be effective against the\nrock that covers this target's body.\n\nI strongly recommend using items with\npowerful destructive properties.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_065_2	There is a 100% probability that {color[0005]}bombs{color[ffff]}\nthat come into contact with Scaldera's\nbody will immediately explode, due to\nthe creature's high body temperature.\nAnalysis indicates that explosions on\nScaldera's outer surface will not yield\ndesired results, however. You must\nlook for a more effective target site.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_065_3	Results from my analysis confirm that\nin order to remove the rocks covering\nScaldera, you will need to inflict\npowerful internal damage.\nWhen Scaldera is inhaling a large\namount of air, I suggest{color[0000]} throwing a\nbomb {color[ffff]}{color[0000]}into its mouth{color[ffff]}.
KEN6_066	Target lock: {color[0003]}Magmanos{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis hand-shaped monster dwells\nin fiery lava. Its body is made up\nentirely of flowing magma. As such, it\nis invulnerable to most attacks.\nTheoretically, it would be possible to\ninflict damage on the monster if you\nwere able to {color[0000]}solidify its body{color[ffff]}.
KEN6_068	Target lock: {color[0003]}Ampilus\n{color[ffff]}\n\n\nThese monsters have inhabited the\ndesert for eons. Their defining\ncharacteristic is an ability to internally\ngenerate electrical energy.\nIt is also said they live to a very old\nage. Their shells are able to disperse\nweight surprisingly well, allowing them\nto safely traverse desert sinksand.
KEN6_069	Target lock: {color[0003]}Armos{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis security and defense mechanism\nwas developed long ago. It will attack\nanything that enters its security\nperimeter.\nAccording to my records, its weak\npoint is its mouth, but it requires some\nspecific measure to make it open\nits mouth.
KEN6_070	Target lock: {color[0003]}Beamos{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis is an ancient security mechanism.\nIts weak point is its eye. The eye is also\na weapon that fires a focused energy\nbeam.\nI calculate a 100% failure rate at any\nattempt to strike the eye with your \nsword while it is still on top of the\npedestal.\nI recommend using a weapon that\ncan strike at high targets. Conversely,\nyou could lower its head to a height\nyour sword can reach.
KEN6_071	Target lock: {color[0003]}Sentrobe{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis security drone was built in\nancient times. It is armed with missiles\nfired from a central turret and flying\nbombs fired from both of its sides.\nAnalysis suggests you can repel the\nmissiles fired from the central turret\nwith certain items at your disposal,\nsuch as your shield.
KEN6_072	Target lock: {color[0003]}Froak{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThough this odd creature is cowardly\nby nature, it will expose an array of\ndensely packed defensive spines\nwhen approached or provoked.
KEN6_073	Target lock: {color[0003]}Cranioc{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis fishlike monster is said to settle\ndisputes with another of its species\npurely by the magnificence of its\nbulbous crowns.\nWhen this creature chooses its prey,\nit will turn red with excitement and\ncharge head-on. Stopping such an\nassault could prove difficult.
KEN6_074	Target lock: {color[0003]}Magma Spume{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis odd creature is quite at home in\nmagma. It stores and processes gas\nproduced by the magma into a flaming\nprojectile that it then spits out.\nCowardly by nature, it sits with its eyes\njust out of the lava in order to detect\nany danger and flee if necessary.
KEN6_075	Target lock: {color[0003]}Cursed Spume{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis mysterious monster's natural\nhabitat includes poisonous swamps and\nother dangerous environments. It spits\nevil curses that it stores up in its body.\nCowardly by nature, it sits with its eyes\njust above the surface in order to\ndetect any danger and flee if\nnecessary.
KEN6_076	Target lock: {color[0003]}Electro Spume\n{color[ffff]}\n\n\nAt home in the desert, this monster\nspits a wad-like, electrified projectile\nthat it produces internally.\n\nCowardly by nature, it sits with its eyes\njust above the surface in order to\ndetect any danger and flee if\nnecessary.
KEN6_077	Target lock: {color[0003]}Tentalus{color[ffff]}{[010c|000602a5]}
KEN6_077_0	As you can likely gather from its other\ntitle, this “Abyssal Leviathan" is said to\nhave been a tyrant of the ancient seas.\n\nIts {color[0005]}{color[0000]}enormous tentacles{color[0005]} {color[ffff]}can be repelled,\nbut they will regenerate after a\nshort time.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_077_A1	My analysis shows that by repelling\na number of its aggressive tentacles,\nthe beast will reveal itself.\n\nThere is a 99% probability that the\ntentacles that attacked you on the ship,\nMaster, can be attributed to Tentalus.\n\nI theorize that using a {color[0000]}sacred power{color[ffff]} \nwill be the most effective means\nof repelling the tentacles.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_077_A2	Results from my analysis confirm that\nits tentacles can be severed with a\nwell-aimed {color[0000]}Skyward Strike{color[ffff]}.\n\nI theorize that the creature's {color[0000]}eye{color[ffff]} is its \nweak point, but the probability that you\ncan actually hit the eye with a Skyward\nStrike is approximately 0%.\nInstead, I recommend utilizing\nlong-range weapons.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_077_A3	To accurately strike at the creature's\n{color[0005]}eye{color[ffff]}—its weak spot—a {color[0005]}bow{color[ffff]} will be most\neffective.\n\nYou can press {[0204|08cd]} to move with your\n{color[0000]}{color[0005]}bow{color[0000]} {color[ffff]}drawn. I recommend shooting\n{color[0000]}arrows {color[ffff]}immediately after dodging\nattacks launched by Tentalus.
KEN6_077_B1	In order to attack Tentalus's weak\nspot, its {color[0000]}eye{color[ffff]}, you must first deal with\nthe tentacles attempting to latch on\nto you.\nMy analysis shows you can easily\nslice the tip of the tentacles with\nyour sword.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_077_B2	Because this monster's tentacles attack\nincessantly and in large number, it is\ntoo dangerous to respond to them one\nat a time.\nMy analysis indicates it is possible to\nrepel the tentacles more efficiently by\nconcentrating an all-out assault on\nthem with your sword.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_077_B3	When the tentacles are repelled,\nthey may drop {color[0000]}hearts{color[ffff]} and {color[0000]}arrows{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nShould you find yourself in danger\nbecause of low hearts or arrows,\nconcentrate on attacking the tentacles\nrather than fleeing from battle.
KEN6_078	Target lock: {color[0003]}Deku Baba{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis violent plant is widespread in\nwooded areas. It will attempt to bite\nanything that approaches it.\n\nThough it is covered in a tough outer\nhusk, the inside of its mouth is soft.\n\n\nI have confirmed the existence of\ntwo varieties: those that open their\nmouths {color[0000]}vertically {color[ffff]}and those that\nopen them {color[0000]}horizontally{color[ffff]}.
KEN6_079	Target lock: {color[0003]}Quadro Baba{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis violent plant is widespread in\nwooded areas. It will attempt to bite\nanything that approaches it.\n\nMore rare than {color[0003]}Deku Baba{color[ffff]}, Quadro\nBaba has greater stamina. A golden\nhusk and dynamic mouth are this\nplant's distinguishing features.
KEN6_081	Target lock: {color[0003]}Peahat{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nAt first glance, this looks like any other\nplant species, but the Peahat has a\nunique ability to fly when the flower on\nits top is pulled off with a {color[0005]}whip{color[ffff]}.
KEN6_087	Target lock: {color[0003]}Sentrobe Bomb{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis is a bomb projectile fired from a\n{color[0003]}Sentrobe{color[ffff]}. It will follow its target\nanywhere, although a timed fuse\nensures it will explode after a set time.
KEN6_088	Target lock: {color[0003]}LD-003D Dreadfuse{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nThis menacing robot guards Sky Keep.\nIt is thought to be of a similar model\nto the robot that stole Skipper's ship\nin {color[0003]}Lanayru Sand Sea{color[ffff]}.\nAs before, when fighting in a narrow\nspace like this, it is more effective to\nuse {color[0000]}thrust {color[ffff]}attacks with your sword than\nto try to swing your sword widely.
KEN6_089	Target lock: {color[0003]}Ghirahim{color[ffff]}{[010c|000602b1]}
KEN6_089_0	There is a 90% change in outward\nappearance compared to previous\nencounters with him. I detect a dark\naura emanating from his entire body.\nI can confirm a change in Ghirahim's\nfighting style, likely as a result of the\nminor damage he has suffered.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_089_1	I project that the {color[0000]}weak spot revealed\non his chest {color[ffff]}from the previous attack\nwill continue to be an effective target.\n\nHowever, there is a 100% probability\nthat Ghirahim will block all attacks\ntargeting this area while he is in his\nstandard state.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_089_2	I suggest you attempt to parry\nGhirahim's sword away, {[0112|00000002]}Master.\nThis should leave the {color[0000]}weak spot on\nhis chest{color[ffff]} open to attack.\nTaking advantage of opportunities to\nattack the villain's weak spot should\nbe your top priority.{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_089_3	My analysis shows that it is impossible\nto parry away Ghirahim's sword\nin one attack.\n\nI theorize that it will become possible\nby {color[0000]}attacking in the same direction{color[ffff]}\na number of times.
KEN6_090	Target lock: {color[0003]}Ghirahim{color[ffff]}{[010c|000602b2]}
KEN6_090_0	There has been a 90% change in his\noutward appearance since our last\nmeeting. I detect a black aura\nemanating from his entire body.\nI have also confirmed that he is\nusing a new weapon.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Understood.
KEN6_090_2	Results from my analysis confirm that\nthe sword Ghirahim wields {color[0000]}can be\nbroken {color[ffff]}by your sword, {[0112|00000002]}Master.\n\nI theorize that Ghirahim used magic\nto call this weapon into existence.\n\n\nNow that he is deeply wounded,\nthe sword he wields appears to\nhave become brittle.\n{[0100|ffff]}More info!{[0101|0000]}Got it.
KEN6_090_3	I have detected identical responses\nfrom {color[0000]}the center of Ghirahim's sword\nand Ghirahim's chest{color[ffff]}.\n\nBy destroying the {color[0000]}sword's core{color[ffff]}, there is\na 100% probability that the sword itself\nwill be destroyed.\n\nI recommend carefully watching the\nsword's movement and repeatedly\nattacking the {color[0000]}same spot{color[ffff]}.

KEN7_000	My apologies. I have no relevant\ninformation on the subject in my\nsizable memory.
KEN7_001	That is a sign. Most often, it is used to\nconvey written information or\nwarnings about the immediate area.
KEN7_002	That is a stone tablet. Depending on the\nlocation and intentions of the original\nauthor, important messages can be\npermanently chiseled on them.
KEN7_003	This {color[0003]}bird statue {color[ffff]}contains significant\nsacred power. If you offer prayers\nthrough it, you can {color[0000]}make a record of\nyour quest progress{color[ffff]}.
KEN7_004	There is a 90% chance this is a type of\nkey. Analysis indicates that there is\na certain order in which the gemstones\nfacing the four directions must be hit.\nI recommend searching the nearby\narea for clues as to what this order\nmight be.
KEN7_005	This magical sentry has a natural\ntendency to stare at the tip of pointed\nobjects.
KEN7_006	This symbol of the goddess will show\nyou the way, {[0112|00000001]}Master. It will react\nto being struck by your {color[0000]}Skyward Strike{color[ffff]}.
KEN7_007	This mechanism is some variety of\n{color[0003]}hang lever switch{color[ffff]}. It is activated\nby lowering the bar.
KEN7_008	This is a typical tree found in {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.\nIts trunk is thin enough to be sliced\nby a sword.
KEN7_009	This is a {color[0003]}lotus leaf root{color[ffff]}. Surrounding\nthe center is a growth of sharp\nprotrusions that can cause injury\nupon contact.\nThe central root has a ringlike\nstructure. You may be able to {color[0000]}latch{color[ffff]}{color[0000]}\non to {color[ffff]}this ring with an item of some\nsort.
KEN7_010	This mechanism can be described as\na sort of a {color[0003]}lever switch{color[ffff]}. {color[0004]}Pull{color[ffff]} the curled\ntip to activate it.
KEN7_011	This hook-shaped construction seems\nvery robust and looks like it could \nsupport a great deal of weight.
KEN7_012	The head of this {color[0003]}bulb-shaped switch{color[ffff]}\ncan be rotated, provided you have\nthe correct tool.
KEN7_013	This contraption is constructed of\na cogwheel and a piece of rope. The\nrope appears to be preventing the\ncog from rotating.
KEN7_014	This mechanism is formed by magic.\nIts purpose is not known to me.
KEN7_015	My visual inspection of this large\ndevice leads me to calculate an\n85% chance that it is built from very\nancient technology.\nAnalysis indicates that activating this\ndevice will require ancient energy from\na remote power node.
KEN7_016	I calculate an 85% probability that\nthis is an energy-generating device.\nIt appears that it will activate if the\ncenter is rotated.
KEN7_022	This is a common Loft Tree. This tree's\nthin trunk makes it a common victim\nof sword practice.
KEN7_024	I must conclude that this is some sort\nof control mechanism. Each embedded\nstone may react to physical force.
KEN7_025	This statue appears to have stood here\nfor a very long time. Nobody knows its\nexact purpose.
KEN7_026	Target lock: {color[0003]}Ampilus egg{color[ffff]}\n\n\n\nIt is an {color[0003]}Ampilus{color[ffff]} that has reverted to its\nearliest form of development, no doubt\nbecause of the effect of the Timeshift\nStone.\nEven in its current state, it retains the\nability to generate powerful electrical\ncurrent at regular intervals.\n\nMy analysis indicates that you can\nhit it with your sword when it is not\ngenerating electricity. Also, you\ncan carry it with the {color[0005]}Hook Beetle{color[ffff]}.
KEN7_027	Visual inspection indicates this object\nis very old. I must conclude that this is\na {color[0003]}Propeller{color[ffff]}. It is an object designed to\nspin in a steady wind.
KEN7_028	This is an ornamental wooden board.\nJudging from its appearance, it has\nrecently fallen from the sky.
KEN7_029	This massive sword has been dropped\nby {color[0003]}Koloktos{color[ffff]}. Although it is quite heavy,\nyou should be able to wield it, {[0112|00000001]}Master.
KEN7_030	This plant is known as a {color[0003]}Water Fruit{color[ffff]}.\nIt collects moisture within its hard\nshell. This feature is vital to its\nsurvival here.
KEN7_031	This is a log used for sword training.\nIt can be cut with a sword along the\ndirection of the notches. 
KEN7_032	This is a log used for {color[0004]}defense {color[ffff]}practice.\nFirst, thrust your sword into the log\nto make it swing.\n\nNext, quickly ready your shield. When\nthe log swings back toward you, strike\nit with a well-timed shield bash.
KEN7_034	My analysis indicates a 90% chance\nthat this is a Fairy. I calculate a 10%\nchance that this is a rare or previously\nundiscovered insect.\nIf my analysis is correct and this is a\nFairy, you can make use of the\nglittering dust that covers its wings\nto heal your wounds.\nAdditionally, if you carry a Fairy with\nyou in a bottle, it will {color[0000]}automatically \nrevive you one time when you run out\nof hearts{color[ffff]}.
KEN7_035	I am detecting extremely strong\ngoddess-aura readings here. There is\na 90% probability that this is the\ndoorway to the goddess's trial.
KEN7_036	I am detecting the goddess's aura in\nyour current position. There is an 85%\nchance that something very important\nwill occur here.
KEN7_037	I calculate an 85% chance that this is\npart of an energy-supplying device.\nIt appears to activate when the center\nis rotated.
KEN7_038	My apologies. I have no relevant\ninformation on the subject in my\nsizable memory.
KEN7_039	It appears to be a perfectly spherical\nobject fashioned from solid crystal.\nIt exhibits an extremely high degree\nof transparency.
KEN7_040	The Water Dragon previously used this\nsizable water basin to soak in healing\nwaters.\n\nThe basin has a handle designed to aid\nin its transportation.\n\n\nHowever, because of its size and\nweight, I do not believe it could be\ncarried by a human. No offense\nintended, I assure you.
KEN7_041	These items are available for purchase\nat the shop.\n\n\nTo hear information about a particular\nitem, or to buy it, stand in front of the\nitem and press {[0204|00cd]}.
KEN7_042	This device was designed to prevent\n{color[0003]}The Imprisoned {color[ffff]}from escaping\nto the outside world.\n\nAccording to my analysis, the sealing\nprocess can be completed with a\nwell-aimed {color[0000]}Skyward Strike{color[ffff]}.
KEN7_043	Visual analysis indicates that is a\nhighly mysterious type of stone tablet\nthat is known to freely gossip and offer\nup information depending on location. \nAlthough not always the case, some of\nthe information it provides can be\nuseful. I recommend you pay attention.
KEN7_044	That is a {color[0000]}Gate of Time{color[ffff]}. It is said\nto transport whoever passes through\nits arch to a different time.\n\nAccording to legend, a fully enhanced\nform of your sword is capable of\nactivating it with a {color[0000]}Skyward Strike{color[ffff]}.
KEN7_045	I detect an exceedingly evil aura under\nthis location. My analysis indicates that\nthis spike is suppressing whatever\nevil is hidden below.
KEN7_046	Insert an engraved tablet into this\n{color[0000]}altar{color[ffff]} to create a {color[0000]}column of light {color[ffff]}that\nwill create an opening in the cloud\nbarrier to the surface.
KEN7_047	That is a sign designed to communicate\nthat an item is out of stock and cannot\nbe purchased. However, it may be\nrestocked at a later time.
KEN7_048	This extremely valuable stone can show\nyou useful information in the form of a\n{color[0000]}hint movie{color[ffff]}.\n\nWhenever you're unsure of what you\nneed to do, I recommend checking the\n{color[0000]}hint movies{color[ffff]} this stone can show you.

KEN8_110	Advice
KEN8_111	Use amiibo
KEN8_112	{[0112|00000001]}Master, please tap an amiibo accessory.
KEN8_113	{[0112|00000005]}Yes, Master—amiibo recognized.\nDo you wish to return to the sky?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes {[0101|0000]}No
KEN8_114	{[0112|00000005]}Yes, Master. This amiibo accessory has\nbeen recognized.\n\n\nAre you ready to return to\n{[0202|00000000]}?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes {[0101|0000]}No
KEN8_115	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I regret to inform you that\ncurrent circumstances prevent using\nan amiibo accessory to return to the sky.
KEN8_116	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I am afraid that amiibo\naccessory is not one that I can\nrecognize.
KEN8_117	{[0112|00000001]}Master, an error occurred while the\namiibo accessory was being read.\nShall I try again?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes {[0101|0000]}No
KEN8_118	{[0112|00000001]}Master, there is no return point\ncurrently established.\n\n\nOnly when you have used an amiibo\naccessory to ascend to the sky can you\nuse it again to return to that point.
KEN8_119	{[0112|00000001]}Master, now that you have accessed\nthe stone statue, you can return to\nthe sky at will.\n\nFurthermore, by using a {color[0000]}certain amiibo\nfigure{color[ffff]}, you can return to the sky\nfrom anywhere on the surface and\ncome back to where you left. \nPlease call me anytime you would like\nto use an amiibo.\n\n\nYou can also enable or disable amiibo\nusage from the {color[0004]}Options{color[ffff]}.
KEN8_120	{[0112|00000001]}Master, it appears that present circumstances\nprevent amiibo usage.\n\n\nOnce the current situation has been\nresolved, amiibo functionality may be\nrestored.

KEN9_000	Ancient buildings can be found on\nthe small islands floating in the\narea around {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.{color[0003]}\n\n{color[ffff]}I calculate over an 80% chance that\nchests will be hidden on such islands.
KEN9_001	To the northeast of {color[0003]}Skyloft {color[ffff]}there is an\nisland called {color[0003]}Bamboo Island{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nAccording to rumors, it is a place\nwhere swordsmen go to test their\nskill in the hopes of winning a reward.
KEN9_002	There is rumored to be an insect\nparadise somewhere in the sky.{[010c|00060386]}
KEN9_002_1	However, nobody has ever reported\nvisiting such a place.
KEN9_002_2	The knight apprentice known as {color[0003]}Strich{color[ffff]}\nis looking for this island and is often\nobserved exploring in the sky.\n\nIt seems that he recently found an\nisland {color[0003]}inside the thunderhead {color[ffff]}suitable\nfor insect habitation.
KEN9_003	There is an island called {color[0003]}Pumpkin\nLanding {color[ffff]}that you can easily spot\nto the southeast of {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.\n\nThere you can enjoy the proprietor's\n{color[0005]}pumpkin soup {color[ffff]}and also exchange\ninformation with patrons.
KEN9_004	There is an island to the southwest of\n{color[0003]}Skyloft {color[ffff]}called {color[0003]}Fun Fun Island{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060388]}
KEN9_004_1	Some say that it will be an attraction\nwhere you can obtain a great amount\nof Rupees easily.
KEN9_004_2	It is a place of amusement where you\ncan procure high-value Rupees with\nsurprisingly little exertion.\n\nYou will require room in your wallet to\ncarry Rupees back with you, though,\nso it would be wise to plan accordingly. 
KEN9_004_3	It is a place of amusement where you\ncan procure high-value Rupees with\nsurprisingly little exertion.\n\nMy analysis indicates that you will\nneed to make a payment to play there.
KEN9_005	Your Loftwing will pick up speed when\nit descends.\n\n\nMy analysis indicates that if you want\nto reach a destination quickly, you\nshould try to stay in constant descent\nas you travel there.
KEN9_006	The {color[0005]}pumpkin soup {color[ffff]}from the Lumpy\nPumpkin on {color[0003]}Pumpkin Landing {color[ffff]}will cool\ndown in five minutes.\n\nCool pumpkin soup is not as effective\nat restoring hearts. The soup should\nbe consumed while it is still hot.
KEN9_007	Loftwings who have mastered the\nadvanced technique of {color[0004]}Spiral Charge\n{color[ffff]}can attack from greater distances.\n\nHowever, it is a dangerous technique,\nso it is currently only being taught to\nthe most senior students at the Knight\nAcademy.
KEN9_008	To enter {color[0003]}Beedle{color[ffff]}'s mobile shop, it seems \nyou need to ring the {color[0000]}large bell{color[ffff]}. {[010c|0006038c]}
KEN9_008_1	Unfortunately, {[0112|00000002]}Master, you do not have\nthe equipment needed to ring the bell.\nYou need to find {color[0000]}something {color[ffff]}that can\nshoot at it from a distance.
KEN9_008_2	The flying shop cannot be observed\nin {color[0003]}Skyloft {color[ffff]}after sundown. This leads me\nto infer that it moves to another island\nat night.\n{color[0000]}If you were to stay in the airborne shop\nuntil nightfall{color[ffff]}, there is a possibility you\nwill discover where it travels to.
KEN9_009	The owner of the Gear Shop in the\nbazaar will buy certain items at night.\n\n\nHowever, he will only buy the\nparticular items he feels like buying\non that day.
KEN9_010	The fortune-teller{[0112|00000002]} can divine\ninformation and foresee the location\nyou need to travel to next.\n\nI am not capable of interpreting crystal\nballs or calculating fates, but statistics\nindicate his fortunes operate at over\n90% accuracy.
KEN9_011	Various treasures are required to\nupgrade items at the Scrap Shop.\n\n\nAmong them is a precious treasure\ncalled an {color[0003]}Evil Crystal{color[ffff]}. It may be\npossible to obtain one by defeating\na monster that can{color[0000]} curse{color[ffff]}.
KEN9_012	Various treasures are required to\nupgrade items at the Scrap Shop.\n\n\nAmong them is the {color[0003]}Blue Bird Feather{color[ffff]},\na particularly precious treasure.\nHopefully it will come as no surprise\nthat it can be obtained from blue birds.
KEN9_013	You will need various treasures to\nenhance items at the Scrap Shop.\n\n\nOne of these treasures is called an\n{color[0003]}Ornamental Skull{color[ffff]}. It is possible to find\none when you defeat a {color[0003]}Bokoblin{color[ffff]}.\n\nIf you are very lucky, you will obtain a\nprecious {color[0003]}Golden Skull{color[ffff]}.
KEN9_014	The larger your wallet, the more\nRupees you can carry with you.\n\n\nApparently, there is a wallet that can\nhold as many as 9,000 Rupees.
KEN9_015	{[0112|00000002]}Analysis indicates that you still have\nmuch to learn about the world.\n\n\nPeriodically visiting the fortune-teller\nat the {color[0003]}bazaar {color[ffff]}would be an effective\nmethod of remedying this situation.
KEN9_016	{color[0003]}Beedle{color[ffff]}'s Airshop sells an item called a\n{color[0000]}Bug Net {color[ffff]}that will allow you to catch\ninsects.{[010c|00060394]}
KEN9_016_1	You can check your {color[0003]}map {color[ffff]}to locate\nBeedle's airborne shop. You will need\nto ring the {color[0000]}large bell {color[ffff]}hanging from the\nshop to gain access.
KEN9_016_2	To enter {color[0003]}Beedle{color[ffff]}'s airborne shop, ring\nthe {color[0000]}large bell {color[ffff]}hanging below the\nstructure.\n\nUnfortunately, {[0112|00000002]}Master, you do not have\nthe equipment needed to ring the bell.\nYou need to find {color[0000]}something {color[ffff]}that can\nshoot a projectile from a distance.
KEN9_017	The {color[0005]}Wooden Shield {color[ffff]}will protect you\nfrom electricity, while the {color[0005]}Iron Shield\n{color[ffff]}will protect you from fire attacks.\n\nThe {color[0005]}Sacred Shield {color[ffff]}is effective against\nboth of these, and it will also slowly\nrepair itself after taking damage.
KEN9_018	There are rumors of a demonic\ncreature being spotted in {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.{[010c|00060396]}
KEN9_018_1	If you are interested, I recommend\ngoing to the{color[0003]} {color[ffff]}{color[0003]}Lumpy Pumpkin{color[ffff]}, where\nthese rumors appear to have\noriginated.
KEN9_018_2	I now calculate a 95% chance that it is\n{color[0003]}Batreaux{color[ffff]} who lives under the shed next\nto the graveyard.
KEN9_018_3	Batreaux would like you to collect\n{color[0005]}Gratitude Crystals {color[ffff]}and wants to see\nthem for himself so that he can become\na human.\nIf you aid him in this search, {[0112|00000002]}Master,\nthere is an 85% probability that it will\nbenefit you as well.
KEN9_018_4	You collected enough {color[0005]}Gratitude\nCrystals{color[ffff]} for Batreaux to become a\nhuman. I estimate a 60% chance that\nthe Skyloft-demon rumor will die.\nBut there is still a 40% probability that\nthe rumor will not fade, based upon the\npossibility that people will still find\nBatreaux's new human face terrifying.
KEN9_019	Many houses in {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]} have chimneys\non their roofs.\n\n\nApparently, people regularly go up \n{color[0000]}inside the chimneys{color[ffff]} to clean the soot\nfrom them.
KEN9_020	Putting {color[0003]}medals{color[ffff]} in your pouch will grant\ndifferent beneficial effects on you.\n\n\nAdditionally, rumors exist of a special\nmedal that confers multiple special\neffects to its possessor.
KEN9_021	It would seem that people in {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}\noften accidentally drop precious items\nfrom their floating town to the surface.\n\nI conjecture that returning those items\nto their rightful owners will earn you\ntheir {color[0000]}gratitude{color[ffff]}.
KEN9_022	If you land a perfect {color[0004]}dive {color[ffff]}in Dodoh's\nHigh Dive on {color[0003]}Fun Fun Island{color[ffff]}, you will\nwin a very precious item.
KEN9_023	The most highly valued Rupee is worth\n300 Rupees.\n\n\nBe aware that picking up an item called\na {color[0000]}Rupoor {color[ffff]}will {color[0000]}reduce{color[ffff]} the number of\nRupees you have by 10.
KEN9_024	Insects can sometimes be found hiding\nunder small jars.\n\n\nYou can locate them by breaking or\nmoving the jars.
KEN9_025	There are several platforms in {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}\nconstructed specifically for mounting\nLoftwings.\n\nIf you fall from a ledge other than one\nof these platforms, a knight guarding\nthe town will think that there has been\nan accident and will come to the rescue.
KEN9_026	A knight on night patrol spotted a\n{color[0003]}Starry Firefly{color[ffff]} flying over the river\nin {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.\n\nSigns indicate that to see a wild Starry\nFirefly for yourself, you must look for\none at night and also possess what\nhumans refer to as “luck."
KEN9_027	If you want to pass the time until\nnightfall, you can always sleep in a bed.\n\n\nIt is also possible to replenish hearts by\nsleeping in a bed.
KEN9_028	It would seem that the great sky spirit,\n{color[0003]}Levias{color[ffff]}, dwells in the clouds near\n{color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.{[010c|000603a0]}
KEN9_028_1	Every year since he was born so long\nago, he has grown larger and larger.\nHe is now the size of a large island.\nHowever, he hasn't been seen recently.
KEN9_028_2	If you get too close to Levias, there is a\ndanger that your Loftwing will collide\nwith one of his fins or his tail.
KEN9_029	This is not exactly a rumor, but if you\n{color[0004]}focus {color[ffff]}on a target with {[0204|07cd]}, and then\npress {[0204|11cd]} {color[0000]}while still targeting it{color[ffff]}, it is\npossible for me to analyze it.{[0111|07cd]}{[0111|09cd]}
KEN9_030	This is not exactly a rumor, but...\n\n\n\nIf you press {[0204|03cd]} to open your {color[0000]}Gear\nscreen{color[ffff]}, you can read a basic description\nof each item you're carrying.{[0111|03cd]}\n\nSimply point at the item you want\nmore information on, and press {[0204|00cd]}.
KEN9_031	I recommend that you {color[0004]}shield bash{color[ffff]} a\nmonster when it swings a sword or a\nclub at you.\n\nWith your shield up, wait until just\nbefore their swing lands, then bash\nthem with your shield.\n\nIf you are successful, you can cause an\nenemy to become momentarily\nstunned, giving you an excellent\nopening in which to attack.
KEN9_032	{color[0004]}Hold your {color[ffff]}{color[0004]}sword straight up {color[ffff]}in the air\nto charge up your sword for a powerful\n{color[0000]}Skyward Strike{color[ffff]}.\n\nYou can even charge a Skyward Strike\nwhile you're on the run if you hold the\nsword steadily enough.\n\nIt is also possible to charge up your\nsword while avoiding monster attacks.\nIf you master this technique, it can be\nvery advantageous in battle.
KEN9_033	A {color[0004]}spin attack{color[ffff]} is a powerful maneuver.\nDepending on which way you swing your\nsword, you can perform a vertical or\nhorizontal version of this attack.
KEN9_034	Some monsters with limited\nintelligence will mistake {color[0005]}bombs\n{color[ffff]}for prey.\n\nI suggest you try offering a{color[0005]} bomb {color[ffff]}to\na {color[0003]}Chuchu{color[ffff]} or {color[0003]}Deku Baba {color[ffff]}and see what\nhappens.
KEN9_035	Gelatinous {color[0003]}Chuchus{color[ffff]} can easily merge\ninto each other to create a bigger,\nmore dangerous monster.\n\nAim your sword strikes to divide their\nbodies and ensure they don't merge\nagain.
KEN9_036	{color[0003]}Deku Hornets {color[ffff]}will not hesitate to\nattack if you venture near their hive.\n\n\nThey are small and agile, so I calculate\nthe probability of hitting them with\nyour sword at approximately 0%.\n\nI recommend that you run away or\nattempt to {color[0000]}capture {color[ffff]}them. Like other\nbugs, they can be taken to the potion\ninfuser and used as raw ingredients.
KEN9_037	You may find Rupees if you cut grass\nwith your sword.\n\n\nIf you release a horizontal {color[0000]}Skyward\nStrike {color[ffff]}toward a patch of grass, you\ncan slice it more efficiently.
KEN9_038	Hitting a mushroom will send spores\ninto the air. {color[0003]}Mushroom Spores{color[ffff]} can be\ncollected in an {color[0003]}Empty Bottle{color[ffff]}.\n\nGlittering mushrooms produce\nGlittering Spores when struck. When \nthese spores are sprinkled over a heart,\nI project something good will happen.
KEN9_039	When you aren't sure of where you \nshould go next, call me with {[0204|11cd]} and\ninquire into your {color[0000]}current objective{color[ffff]},\nor alternatively you may ask for a {color[0000]}hint{color[ffff]}.{[0111|09cd]}\nAdditionally, you may find speaking\nwith the {color[0003]}fortune-teller{color[ffff]} in Skyloft\nuseful.
KEN9_040	{[0112|00000005]}Yes, Master.{[010c|000603ac]}
KEN9_040_1	Do you recall seeing the {color[0000]}mysterious{color[ffff]}{color[0000]}\ncubes {color[ffff]}bearing the mark of the goddess\nthroughout the land below?\n\nThere seems to be a connection\nbetween those cubes and the locked\nchests in {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]} and the surrounding\nislands.
KEN9_040_2	Technically speaking, this is no rumor,\nbut I will pass on this information\nnonetheless.\n\nWhen energy is released from the\n{color[0000]}Goddess Cubes {color[ffff]}scattered across the\nland and it launches into the sky,\nI can calculate its trajectory.\nThen I will note the location in the sky\nthat the energy has returned to on your\nmap, {[0112|00000002]}Master.
KEN9_041	{color[0003]}{[0201|0024]} {color[ffff]}have a variety of\nuses.\n\n\nWhile their effects on {color[0003]}heart flowers{color[ffff]}\nand {color[0003]}Rupees{color[ffff]} are well known, you may\nwant to try sprinkling them on a\nvariety of other items as well.
KEN9_042	Using {[0204|29cd]} and {[0204|28cd]}, you\ncan switch items, drink potions, and\nperform other actions while you are\n{color[0000]}moving{color[ffff]}.{[0111|0fcd]}{[0111|0ecd]}\nThis technique is valuable because it\nallows you to perform an action while\nmaintaining a safe distance from your\nenemies.
KEN9_043	{[0112|00000005]}Yes, Master.{[010c|000603af]}
KEN9_043_A	{color[0003]}Bird Feathers{color[ffff]} are a useful material\noften used in equipment upgrades.\n\n\nHowever, there is a 90% probability\nyou will need some kind of tool to\ncatch the birds who provide these\nfeathers.
KEN9_043_B0	In ancient times, a great warrior\ndevised a strategy to collect lots of \narrows. Do you know it, {[0112|00000002]}Master?\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me!{[0101|0000]}I know it.
KEN9_043_B1	The warrior took out his {color[0003]}Wooden\nShield {color[ffff]}and approached the Bokoblin\nfort.\n\nHe hid behind his shield as the\nBokoblins rained arrows down on\nhim. He then retreated out of range.\n\nMany arrows {color[0000]}were {color[ffff]}{color[0000]}stuck in his {color[ffff]}{color[0000]}Wooden\nShield{color[ffff]}. All he needed to do then was\npull them out and fire them back at\nhis enemies with his bow.
KEN9_043_B2	You could use a Wooden Shield to\nemploy this same strategy, {[0112|00000002]}Master.\n\n\nHowever, doing so will damage your\nshield, so {color[0000]}pay attention to your\nshield gauge{color[ffff]}.
KEN9_044	As you may have observed during your\ntime as one, human beings are not a\nspecies that can stay underwater for\nlong periods of time.{[010c|000603b0]}
KEN9_044_1	Somewhere in the world is an item\ncalled a {color[0003]}Water Dragon's Scale{color[ffff]}.\nRumors suggest that this item allows\na person to dive deep underwater.
KEN9_044_2	If you return to places you previously\nvisited, you may be able to reach new\nareas using the power of the\n{color[0003]}Water Dragon's Scale{color[ffff]}.\nSince you already possess this item,\nyou can easily dive underwater.\n
KEN9_045	You may not know this, but human\nbeings are not a species that can\nsurvive in extremely high-temperature \nenvironments.{[010c|000603b1]}
KEN9_045_1	There is an item called {color[0003]}Fireshield\nEarrings {color[ffff]}in this world somewhere.\nThey allow the wearer to remain in\nareas of extreme heat.
KEN9_045_2	Of course, you already possess the\n{color[0003]}Fireshield Earrings{color[ffff]}, so you can freely\nenter extremely hot areas.\n\nI recommend thoroughly exploring\nplaces that were previously too hot\nto travel through safely.
KEN9_046	Using {color[0004]}sidesteps{color[ffff]} and {color[0004]}backflips{color[ffff]} to dodge\nmonster attacks and then quickly\nmounting a counterattack is considered\nan advanced fighting technique.\nTo perform these maneuvers, press and\nhold {[0204|07cd]} to target and while moving {[0204|08cd]}\nleft, right, or back, press {[0204|00cd]}.{[0111|07cd]}\n\nThese moves will be particularly\nuseful when your shield is broken.
KEN9_047	When you {color[0004]}roll {color[ffff]}to bump into a tree or\nwall, objects may become dislodged\nand fall from above.\n\nCheck Help by pressing {[0204|25cd]} to review\ncontrols for a forward roll.{[0111|0bcd]}
KEN9_048	When you find a {color[0000]}bird statue{color[ffff]}, you should\nalways examine it more closely, even if\nyou have no intention of using it to save\nyour progress.\nExamining the bird statue will record it\non your map, allowing you to check its\nposition later with {[0204|02cd]}.{[0111|02cd]}
KEN9_049	In addition to saving your progress,\n{color[0000]}bird statues{color[ffff]} located on the surface\noffer you a way to return to the sky.\n\nHowever, it seems that statues housed\ninside buildings do not possess the\nability to send you back to the sky.
KEN9_050	You can climb walls covered in vines,\nbut doing so will slowly deplete your\n{color[0000]}stamina gauge{color[ffff]}.\n\nYou can move more quickly when\nclimbing by jumping, but doing so\ndepletes a significant amount of\nyour {color[0000]}stamina gauge{color[ffff]}.{[010c|000603b6]}
KEN9_050_1	Additionally, {color[0005]}Clawshots{color[ffff]} have the\nability to latch on to vines, so you may\nwant to use them in order to reach\nvines from a distance.
KEN9_051	While this information does not\ntechnically qualify as a rumor, I feel\nit will be of use to you.\n\nHold down {[0204|22cd]} to bring up potential\ntargets to {color[0004]}dowse{color[ffff]} for, then select one\nto begin dowsing.{[0111|08cd]}\n\nYou can search for various items by \nswitching your dowsing target. \n\n\nAlso, if you do not want to dowse for\nanything, you can choose to {color[0004]}look around{color[ffff]}\nwithout dowsing.
KEN9_052	On slippery slopes, you may lose your\nfooting and slide down on your\nbackside. Quite gracefully, I'm sure,\nMaster.\nOnce you begin sliding, you will not be\nable to stop, but you can direct your\nslide using {[0204|0ecd]}.
KEN9_053	{color[0003]}Medals{color[ffff]} will give you various beneficial\neffects as long as you carry them in\nyour pouch.\n\nIf you carry a {color[0003]}Heart Medal {color[ffff]}in your\npouch, my analysis indicates you will\nhave a greater chance of finding\na {color[0003]}heart{color[ffff]} when you defeat a monster.\nA {color[0003]}Rupee Medal{color[ffff]} has a similar effect.\nIt increases the chance you will find\nRupees when you defeat a foe.\n\nSeveral other types of medals are\nknown to exist.
KEN9_054	Medals will grant you various\nbeneficial effects as long as you\ncarry them in your pouch.\n\nA {color[0003]}Potion Medal{color[ffff]} will increase the\nduration of the effects of certain\npotions, such as {color[0005]}Stamina Potions{color[ffff]}.\n\nAdditionally, several other types of\nmedals are known to exist.
KEN9_055	{[0112|00000005]}Yes, Master.{[010c|000603bb]}
KEN9_055_1	You possess sufficient arm strength to\nslice your sword through the trunks of\nsmaller trees.\n\nIf a point on a tree appears to glow,\ncut through that spot with your\nsword and you may be rewarded with\na Rupee.
KEN9_055_2	Any {color[0003]}{[0201|0007]}s {color[ffff]}that don't hit their\ntarget can be picked up and reused.
KEN9_056	I conjecture this information will be\nof use to you.\n\n\nPress {[0204|13cd]} to read information about the\nactions immediately available to you.{[0111|0bcd]}\n\n\nBy doing this, you may learn of new\nactions that you can perform.
KEN9_057	When you want to hang down from an\nedge or cliff without jumping, press\n{[0204|00cd]} to {color[0004]}hang down{color[ffff]}.\n\nUse {[0204|0ecd]} to move along the ledge while\nyou are hanging.
KEN9_058	You can fill an {color[0003]}Empty Bottle{color[ffff]} with many\nthings, such as potions, water from\nstreams, {color[0003]}Mushroom Spores{color[ffff]}, and\n{color[0003]}pumpkin soup{color[ffff]}.\nEmpty Bottles can even be used to\ncatch {color[0003]}Fairies{color[ffff]}.
KEN9_059	While not technically a rumor, I am\nsure the information I am about to\nrelay to you will prove useful.\n\nWhile targeting an object or character\nwith {[0204|07cd]}, you can press {[0204|11cd]} to hear my\nanalysis of the targeted subject.{[0111|07cd]}{[0111|09cd]}\n\nI calculate a 60% chance that a portion\nof the information contained in my\nanalysis will be new to you.
KEN9_200	When you require my analysis of a\n{color[0004]}target{color[ffff]}, press {[0204|11cd]} {color[0000]}while targeting it\n{color[ffff]}with {[0204|07cd]}.{[0111|07cd]}{[0111|09cd]}

KEN0_SIREN_01	{[0112|00000001]}Something here is reacting to our\nperformance of Farore's Courage.\nI have confirmed the appearance of\na strange mark on the ground.\nI calculate a 90% possibility that this\nmark is a Trial Gate, as mentioned\nby the goddess statue we heard\nfrom on the Isle of Songs.\nThrust your sword into the center\nof the mark on the ground before you.
KEN0_SIREN_02	Thrust your sword into the center of\nthe mark and open the way to a new\nSilent Realm.
KEN0_SIREN_03	Thrust your sword into the center of\nthe mark and open the way to the final\nSilent Realm.
FAY_04	{[0112|00000001]}Master, the melody you just acquired is\none part of the {color[0003]}Song of the Hero{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nI recommend you seek out the other\ntwo dragons in their respective areas\nto learn the other two parts of the\nsong.
FAY_04_2	Well done, {[0112|00000002]}Master. You have acquired\nthe second part of the Song of the\nHero. The final part can be found\nsomewhere within {color[0003]}Faron Woods{color[ffff]}.
FAY_04_2_2	Well done, {[0112|00000002]}Master. You have acquired\nthe second part of the Song of the\nHero. The final part can be found\nsomewhere within {color[0003]}Eldin Volcano{color[ffff]}.
FAY_04_2_3	Well done, {[0112|00000002]}Master. You have acquired\nthe second part of the Song of the\nHero. The final part can be found\nsomewhere within {color[0003]}Lanayru Desert{color[ffff]}.
FAY_04_3	Well done, {[0112|00000002]}Master. You've successfully\ncollected three parts of the Song of the\nHero.\n\nI recommend you return to the sky\nand meet with the great sky spirit,\n{color[0003]}Levias{color[ffff]}, to complete the song.
FAY_05	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I have information for you.\nYou have obtained a map of this area.\nYou can view it by pressing {[0204|02cd]}.{[0111|02cd]}\n\nThe position of doors and their locks,{[0104|000f]}\nas well as the position and status of\ntreasure chests,{[0104|000f]} can be confirmed on\nthe map with marks such as {[0204|19cd]}.\nHowever, be aware that you will be\n{color[0000]}unable to use beacons{color[ffff]} here due to\nthe indoor nature of this environment.
FAY_06	A report, {[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}.\nI have detected the aura of a Trial Gate\nnearby.\n\nIf you can pinpoint the origin of this\naura using dowsing, I conjecture the\nsong you learned at the Isle of Songs,\nFarore's Courage, will reveal the gate.
FAY_07	A report, {[0112|0000000b]}Master. The volcanic activity\nthat impeded your return to the sky\nearlier has ceased.\n\nIt is now possible to return to the sky\nagain.
KEN0_08	After winning the race in the Wing\nCeremony, you went on a flight with\n{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} where you encountered a storm\nthat caused Zelda to fall to the surface.\nShortly thereafter, you entered an\nold chamber and claimed the\nGoddess Sword in which I, {color[0003]}Fi{color[ffff]}, reside.\n\nYou then used the power of an ancient\n{color[0005]}tablet {color[ffff]}to open a {color[0000]}column of light\n{color[ffff]}leading to the land below.
KEN0_09	After winning the race in the Wing\nCeremony, you took to the sky with\n{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} where you encountered a storm\nthat caused Zelda to fall to the surface.\nDown below the clouds, you met with\na mysterious old woman who spoke of\na great destiny that involves both you\nand Zelda.
KEN0_10	To begin your search for {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, you\ndescended to the surface, where you\nmet a mysterious old woman who spoke\nof the destiny invoking you and Zelda.\nShortly thereafter, you made your way\nto {color[0003]}Faron Woods {color[ffff]}and learned from the\n{color[0003]}Kikwis{color[ffff]} that Zelda entered a temple\nin the area.
KEN0_11	In order to find {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, you descended\nto the surface and explored {color[0003]}Skyview\nTemple {color[ffff]}deep within {color[0003]}Faron Woods{color[ffff]}.\n\nAt the temple, you discovered a statue\nof the goddess whose song indicates\nthat Zelda has now headed to\n{color[0003]}Eldin Province{color[ffff]}.
KEN0_12	In your search for {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, who fell\nbeneath the clouds to the land below,\nyou have made your way to\n{color[0003]}Eldin Volcano{color[ffff]}.\nJudging by conversations of the {color[0003]}Mogma{color[ffff]}\nwe overheard, I conjecture that Zelda\nis inside the {color[0003]}Earth Temple{color[ffff]}.
KEN0_13	We have learned that {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, who fell\nto the surface and is still missing, is\ntraveling with an {color[0000]}unknown person {color[ffff]}for\nreasons we do not fully understand.\nJudging by the song from the goddess\nstatue that we heard, you now know\nthat Zelda headed to {color[0003]}Lanayru\nProvince{color[ffff]}.
KEN0_14	We have learned that {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, who fell\nto the surface and is still missing, is\ntraveling with an {color[0000]}unknown person {color[ffff]}for\nreasons we do not fully understand.\nI infer these two entered the {color[0003]}Temple of\nTime{color[ffff]} in {color[0003]}Lanayru Desert{color[ffff]}, but we are\nunable to enter the temple via usual\nmeans as the gate has been destroyed.
KEN0_15	For reasons we do not fully understand,\n{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} has been traveling all across the\nland.\n\nYou were successful in meeting her\nat the {color[0003]}Temple of Time{color[ffff]}, but our\ndiscourse was cut short by {color[0003]}Ghirahim{color[ffff]},\nwho attempted to attack Zelda.\nDuring Ghirahim's attack, Zelda\nentrusted you with her {color[0000]}harp{color[ffff]} and then\nran from the area through a {color[0000]}strange\ngate{color[ffff]}. 
KEN0_16	In order to accomplish her own\nmission, Zelda entrusted her harp to\nyou and fled through a Gate of Time.\n\nA second Gate of Time exists, but in\norder to activate it, you will need to\n{color[0000]}enhance your sword{color[ffff]}.
KEN0_17	{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} passed through a Gate of Time \nin order to accomplish her mission.\nYou will need to {color[0000]}enhance your sword{color[ffff]}\nto open the gate and reach her.\nTo meet this goal, you learned a song\nknown as {color[0000]}Farore's Courage{color[ffff]} on the {color[0003]}Isle\nof Songs{color[ffff]}. It will guide you on your\nquest to enhance your sword.
KEN0_18	{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} passed through a Gate of Time \nin order to accomplish her mission.\nYou will need to {color[0000]}enhance your sword{color[ffff]}\nto open the gate and reach her.\nIn your quest to find the {color[0000]}sacred flames{color[ffff]}\nthat can do this, you sought out and\novercame the {color[0000]}trial{color[ffff]} within {color[0003]}Faron Woods{color[ffff]}.
KEN0_19	{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} passed through a Gate of Time \nin order to accomplish her mission.\nYou will need to {color[0000]}enhance your sword{color[ffff]}\nto open the gate and reach her.\nYou have learned that the first of the\n{color[0000]}sacred flames{color[ffff]} that will make this\npossible lies within the {color[0003]}Ancient Cistern{color[ffff]}.\n\nThe Water Dragon, {color[0003]}Faron{color[ffff]}, has now\ngranted you access to this location.
KEN0_20	{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} passed through a Gate of Time \nin order to accomplish her mission.\nYou will need to {color[0000]}enhance your sword{color[ffff]}\nto open the gate and reach her.\nThe {color[0000]}sacred flame{color[ffff]} you found in the\n{color[0003]}Ancient Cistern{color[ffff]} has purified your\nsword and given it its first\nenhancement.
KEN0_21	{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} passed through a Gate of Time \nin order to accomplish her mission.\nYou will need to {color[0000]}enhance your sword{color[ffff]}\nto open the gate and reach her.\nIn your quest to find the {color[0000]}sacred flames{color[ffff]}\nthat can do this, you sought out and\novercame the {color[0000]}trial {color[ffff]}located within\n{color[0003]}Lanayru Desert{color[ffff]}.

KEN0_23	{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} passed through a Gate of Time \nin order to accomplish her mission.\nYou will need to {color[0000]}enhance your sword{color[ffff]}\nto open the gate and reach her.\nThe {color[0000]}sacred flame{color[ffff]} you found within the\n{color[0003]}Sandship{color[ffff]} sailing the {color[0003]}Lanayru Sand Sea{color[ffff]}\nhas purified your sword, imbuing it\nwith a second enhancement.
KEN0_24	{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} passed through a Gate of Time \nin order to accomplish her mission.\nYou will need to {color[0000]}enhance your sword{color[ffff]}\nto open the gate and reach her.\nIn your quest to find the {color[0000]}sacred flames{color[ffff]}\nthat can do this, you sought out and\novercame the {color[0000]}trial{color[ffff]} located on\n{color[0003]}Eldin Volcano{color[ffff]}.
KEN0_25	{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} passed through a Gate of Time \nin order to accomplish her mission.\nYou will need to {color[0000]}enhance your sword{color[ffff]}\nto open the gate and reach her.\nTo find the final {color[0000]}sacred flame{color[ffff]} needed\nto enhance your blade, you have\nentered the {color[0003]}Fire Sanctuary{color[ffff]} hidden atop\n{color[0003]}Eldin Volcano{color[ffff]}.
KEN0_26	{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} passed through a Gate of Time \nin order to accomplish her mission.\nYou will need to {color[0000]}enhance your sword{color[ffff]}\nto open the gate and reach her.\nThe final {color[0000]}sacred flame{color[ffff]}, which you\nfound within the {color[0003]}Fire Sanctuary{color[ffff]},\nhas purified your sword, allowing it\nto achieve its true form.
KEN0_27	Your sword has transformed into the\nMaster Sword. With this sword, you can\nnow activate the Gate of Time and go\nto Zelda, who waits beyond the gate.\nAs you attempted to open the gate,\nthe giant monster that you previously\ndefeated broke free of its prison,\nforcing you to beat it back once more.

It was\nsoooo close. Now, that was a race...\n\n{[0109|000a0700]}Hey, your Crimson Loftwing will be\nin the race, right? {[0104|0028]}I'm looking forward\nto seeing what he can do.
TW_01_01	{[0109|000a0705]}I'm looking forward to seeing your\nLoftwing in action!
TW_01_02	{[0109|00000004]}What's wrong, {[0200]}?{[0109|00001100]}\nWhat?! Your Loftwing is {[0104|0032]}missing?\n\n\n{[0109|00111100]}That's terrible! I was so looking\nforward to seeing that red blur\nstreak through the sky.\n\nNo, no{[0106|fbcd]}...{[0106|00cd]}I haven't seen him.\n\n\n\n{[0109|000a1100]}Hmm{[0106|fbcd]}...{[0106|00cd]} Why not check with\nSkyloft's{color[0000]} bird expert{color[ffff]}, {color[0003]}{[010b|00000004]}Pipit{color[ffff]}?\n{[0109|00000700]}He might be able to help.
TW_01_03	{[0109|00000002]}If you're talking Loftwings, talk to\n{color[0003]}Pipit{color[ffff]}. That guy knows almost\neverything about anything with wings.\n\nYou know Pipit, right? He's one of\nthe top students at the Knight\nAcademy.
TW_02	{[0109|00000002]}Where in the clouds is that {color[0003]}Fledge{color[ffff]} boy?\nHe's supposed to be bringing me\n{color[0000]}barrels{color[ffff]}!\n\n{[0109|00100f00]}Sometimes I just don't know what's\ngoing on in that boy's head.
TW_02_01	{[0109|00000003]}Are you talking to me about your\nLoftwing? Right now?\n\n\n{[0109|00100e00]}I'm a little busy here, so buzz off!
TW_02_02	{[0109|000a0401]}Oh? {[0301]}{[0200]}! You're\ndelivering something for me?\n\n\n{[0109|00100802]}That was supposed to be {color[0003]}Fledge's\n{color[ffff]}job...\n\n\n{[0109|00090400]}Anyhow, just bring the {color[0000]}barrel{color[ffff]} here.\nYes, here.
TW_02_03	{[0109|00090802]}What's all this? I thought I told {color[0003]}Fledge\n{color[ffff]}to carry that! Bah, it's probably for\nthe best... That skinny boy would\nprobably have gotten flattened.\n{[0109|000a0c00]}Say...don't you have some important\nceremony or some such today? Hmph!\nWell, thanks for the help.
TW_02_04	{[0109|000c1206]}What do you think you're doing?!\n\n\n\n{[010d|1906]}{[010a|000f00cd]}You'd better clean that up!
TW_02_05	{[0109|000c1207]}{[0108|01cd]}Enough already! {[010d|1906]}You little brat!\n\n\n\n{[010a|000f00cd]}Do that again, and you'll be mopping\nsoup stains for a week!
TW_02_06	{[0109|000c1252]}{[0108|02cd]}I've had it!\n{[010d|1906]}\n\n\n{[010a|000f00cd]}I'm going to have a word with\nthe headmaster about having you\nexpelled!
TW_02_07	{[0109|00000001]}The {color[0000]}Wing Ceremony {color[ffff]}is starting soon.\nQuit with the dillyin' and dallyin', and\nget your tail over there!
TW_03	{[0112|00000001]}Master, there is a high probability\nthat this beam of light will lead us to\nclues as to the whereabouts of the\nthree flames.\nI recommend that you investigate what\nlies at the end of this beam of light.
TW_04	{[0109|00000001]}Mornin', {[0200]}. How's\nlife? Did you manage to get even a\nwink of sleep last night?\n\nFigured you might've been tossin' and\nturnin' all night thinkin' about the big\n{color[0000]}ceremony{color[ffff]} today.\n\nWhat am I doin'? {[0104|0028]}Oh, just fixin' this\ngate here...\n\n\nIt's been squeaky lately, and we can't\nhave that on the day of the ceremony!\n\n\n{[0109|000c0c00]}Hey, you haven't already forgotten to\n{color[0000]}send your {color[ffff]}{color[0000]}prayers {color[ffff]}to the goddess this\nmorning, have you?\n\n{[010a|000600cd]}Just face the {color[0000]}bird statue {color[ffff]}over there,\nand say a short prayer to {color[0000]}save{color[ffff]} your\nprogress.\n\n{[0109|000c0c00]}{[010a|ffff00cd]}As you know, those bird statues are all\nover Skyloft. It's about time you get in\nthe habit of stoppin' at a statue every\ntime you run by one.\n{[0109|00000008]}{color[0000]}A prayer in time saves nine{color[ffff]}, if you\nknow what I'm sayin'!
TW_04_01	{[0109|00000003]}I'm still workin' on the gate here, so\nit'll be out of commission for a little\nbit until I finish up.\n{[0100|ffff]}Where's Zelda? {[0101|ffff]}Ceremony?
TW_04_02	{[0109|00000005]}{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}? {[0104|001e]}Oh, she was just at the Statue\nof the Goddess with Headmaster\nGaepora.\n\nWhat's the best way up to the big\nstatue? It's time you learn for\nyourself, kid. Just press {[0204|22cd]} to take a\nlook around. You can't miss her!{[0111|08cd]}
TW_04_03	{[0109|00000003]}All set for today's big {color[0000]}Wing Ceremony{color[ffff]}?\n\n\n\nIf you come away with a win, you'll\nmove on up to the {color[0000]}senior class{color[ffff]}.\nThen after you graduate, you get to\nbe a {color[0000]}rescue knight{color[ffff]}.\nThose knights sure do keep order here\nin Skyloft, and I don't have to tell you\nthat it's a pretty big deal to become\none. I'd like to see you make it.
TW_04_04	{[0109|00000005]}Is something wrong? What's the\nbig hurry?\n\n\nWhat?! Your Loftwing is missing?!\n{[0104|0032]}But {[010b|00000004]}I just {color[0000]}saw{color[ffff]} him. {color[0003]}Groose's bird {color[ffff]}was\nchasing off after your feathered fella.\n{[0100|ffff]}Which way?{[0101|ffff]}Where's Groose?
TW_04_05	{[0109|00000012]}Uh, I think...uh... Well, to be honest,\nI don't really know where they went.
TW_04_06	{[0109|00000004]}Oh, {color[0003]}Groose {color[ffff]}and his little cronies were\nsaying they were headed down to the\n{color[0000]}Wing Ceremony{color[ffff]} in the Plaza.
TW_04_08	So my guess is they might be in the Plaza.\nNormally, the fastest way there is just\ndown this path...\n\nBut this gate here still needs some work\nbefore it'll open. Can you go around\nthrough the academy? Remember to\ncheck the map with {[0204|02cd]} if you get lost!{[0111|02cd]}
TW_04_09	Oh, you still tryin' to get down to the\nsouth end? That {[0204|19cd]} mark on your map,\nthat's the Plaza.\n\nIt's where they're holding the {color[0000]}Wing\nCeremony{color[ffff]} today, so you'll definitely\nwant to find it before too long!
TW_04_07	{[0109|00000005]}Still got more questions, eh?\n{[0100|ffff]}My bird! {[0101|ffff]}Groose?
TW_05_01	{[0109|00000001]}{[010d|1906]}Hold up, {[0200]}!\nHey! Hey, {[0200]}!\n\n{[010d|0500]}\nCould you help me with something?\nAll you have to do is {color[0004]}dash {color[ffff]}and {color[0004]}roll\n{color[ffff]}into the tree.\n\nJust like I've been doing. Dash, then,\nwhen you're in front of the tree—BAM!\nDo a{color[0004]} roll {color[ffff]}right into it! So come on...{[0104|001e]}\nPleeeeease?
TW_05_02	{[0109|00000004]}OK, so to {color[0004]}roll{color[ffff]}, first thing you gotta do\nis dash to run super fast...\n\n\nWhile you're running, BAM! If you hit it\njust right, something will drop down from\nabove. So come on... {[0104|001e]}You have to try it!
TW_05_04	{[0109|00000008]}Whooooooooa!{[0104|001e]} You did it! \nA {color[0003]}Sky Stag Beetle{color[ffff]}!\n\n\nWait up!
TW_05_05	{[0109|000f1300]}Awwww! My {color[0003]}Sky Stag Beetle{color[ffff]}...\nSo close... {[0109|000a0900]}Oh well. To catch it, I would\nneed a {[0201|0047]}, anyway.\n\nI wish I hadn't thrown out the one I\nbought at {color[0000]}Beedle's Airshop{color[ffff]}.\n{[0109|00110200]}Awwww...
TW_07	{[0109|00000003]}I'm gonna shut this! We can't have any\ncreepy apparitions crawlin' in at night.\n\n\nI'll leave that door up on the second\nfloor open, though. Just don't let me\ncatch you going out after dark!\n\nNow I know your cute little friend\nZelda is gone and you want to go rescue\nher, but no honest folk here in Skyloft\ngo skulking around in the night.
TW_07_01	{[0109|00000b05]}Even those bratty kids are asleep.\nAhhhh, finally some peace.\n\n\n{[0109|000a0800]}So! Do you think you can find Zelda?\nBest of luck to you!
TW_09	{[0109|00000001]}Hiya, {[0200]}! Nice breeze\ntoday, huh? Perfect for the ceremony!\n\n\n{[0109|00110200]}So who do you think will win today?\nI guess {color[0003]}Groose{color[ffff]} is a strong contender,\nbut...\n\n{[0109|000c0200]}The winner will get blessed by a village\ngirl chosen to represent the goddess...\n{[0109|00000609]}How romantic!
TW_09_01	{[0109|000c0209]}I dream of playing the part of the\ngoddess at the Wing Ceremony!\nJust to have a romantic ceremony\nwith the handsome, winning knight.\nJust once is all I ask...
TW_09_02	{[0109|00000057]}What's up, {[0200]}? You\nseem to be in a hurry...\n\n\nWhat's this about your bird? Oh, that\nunusual Crimson Loftwing...\n{[0104|0028]}Have I seen him?{[0106|fbcd]}{[0106|00cd]} {[0109|00110200]}I'm sorry. I haven't.\n\n{[0109|00090204]}Why don't you look for him by the\nStatue of the Goddess? You'll have a\ngood view of the whole town from way\nup there.\nJust check your {color[0000]}map {color[ffff]}using {[0204|02cd]}.\nKnowing you, that's the best way to\navoid getting lost...again.{[0111|02cd]}
TW_09_03	{[0109|00000004]}Press {[0204|02cd]} to check your {color[0000]}map {color[ffff]}and find\nyour way to the Statue of the Goddess.\nLook for your bird there!{[0111|02cd]}
TW_11_01	{[0109|00090401]}Morning, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00080400]}So...today's the {color[0000]}Wing Ceremony{color[ffff]}.\nAre you ready?\n\n\nAll I'm saying is everyone else is out\npracticing at the plaza, but you seem\npretty...relaxed about the whole thing.\n\n{[0109|000b0400]}Of course, that {color[0000]}Crimson Loftwing {color[ffff]}of\nyours is something special. I'd feel\npretty confident riding him, too!\n\nMy bird won the last ceremony, but\neven I don't think he could beat that\nred terror of yours...\n\n{[0109|00080400]}Of course, a bird's true speed in a\nrace always comes down to the skill\nof the rider.\n\nI'm something of a bird researcher\naround here. {[0109|000c0405]}So, you know, if you\never find yourself in need of some\nbird expertise, come see ol' {color[0003]}Pipit{color[ffff]}. 
TW_11_08	{[0109|000c0405]}If you need to know anything about\nbirds, you just let ol' {color[0003]}Pipit{color[ffff]} know!
TW_11_02	{[0109|00000c06]}You're not still wandering around\nthe academy, are you?!\n\n\n{[0109|000c0c09]}What?!{[0104|0014]} Your Loftwing won't come\nwhen you call for it? {[0109|00010c00]}Why would a\nguardian bird not come when it's\ncalled?\nYou know, I've never heard of this\never happening before, so I can't even\ntell you what you're doing wrong...\n\n{[0109|00080400]}But a good senior never hangs an\nunderclassman out to dry. We'll figure\nthis out together!\n\n{[0109|000b0c00]}You go to the plaza, and ask people\nthere if they know anything. In the\nmeantime, I'll ask around here.
TW_11_09	{[0109|000b0c00]}You won't find your bird hanging\naround here unless he's enrolling in\nthe academy. You should stick with\nsearching outside for now.\nI'll be asking around for leads too,\nand I'll let you know if I find out\nanything that'll help.
TW_11_03	{[0109|00080401]}Hey, {[0200]}! I was just\nlooking for you.
TW_11_04	{[0109|00090c00]}I heard your Loftwing has gone\nmissing, so I thought I'd join in the\nsearch.\n\n{[0109|00000c00]}And get this: when I asked Fledge what\nhe knew, he started acting weird.
TW_11_05	That's it! Right there. I think it means\nthe {color[0000]}waterfall {color[ffff]}marked here with {[0204|19cd]}.
TW_11_06	{[0109|00000404]}You know how to read a map, right?\nPress {[0204|02cd]} at any time to see a map of\nthe area.{[0111|02cd]} {[0109|00080400]}If you get lost, just press {[0204|02cd]}!{[0111|02cd]}
TW_11_07	{[0109|00000004]}One more thing, {[0200]}!
TW_11_10	{[0109|00010002]}{[0301]}{[0200]}!{[010d|1906]}
TW_11_22	If you're heading over to the plaza,\nthe quickest way is out the door on the\nground floor.\n\n{[0109|00090400]}The exit on the top floor is still locked,\nso you obviously can't get out there.
TW_11_23	{[0109|000c0c16]}What's taking the lunch lady so long?\nI'm going to have a word with her later.
TW_11_11	{[0109|00000002]}{[0108|02cd]}Hey!{[010d|1906]} {[0301]}{[0200]}!
TW_11_12	{[0109|0c000812]}I'm so sorry, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\n{[0109|0c000800]}I really wanted to tell you, but...{[0106|00cd]}if\n{color[0003]}Groose{color[ffff]} found out I told you...
TW_11_13	{[0109|00000c16]}It sounds like {color[0003]}Groose{color[ffff]} forced him to\nkeep quiet about it.
TW_11_14	{[0109|0c070e11]}Just a little while ago, when I was\ncleaning the dining hall, Groose and\nhis buddies came in.\n\n{[0109|0c000800]}They didn't notice I was there and\nstarted talking about their {color[0000]}plan {color[ffff]}{color[0000]}to hide\n{color[ffff]}your Loftwing.\n\n{[0109|0c000800]}I wanted to warn you,\n{[0200]}. But just as I\ntried to sneak away...\n\n{[0109|0c010e00]}Groose and his gang grabbed me...\n\n\n\n{[0109|0c070e00]}They said that if I told you, they'd\nmake sure I would never be able to\nride a bird ever again!
TW_11_15	{[0109|00090c00]}It sounds like Groose and his buddies\nhad a plan to capture your bird and\nhide him near a {color[0000]}{color[0000]}{[010b|00000004]}{color[0000]}waterfall{color[ffff]}.\n\n{[0109|00080c00]}Well, near a waterfall would mean{[0106|fbcd]}...{[0106|00cd]}\n{[0104|0028]}Quick—let's take a look at your {color[0000]}map{color[ffff]}.
TW_11_16	{[0109|0c000819]}Forgive me, {[0200]}! I can't\nhelp being such a coward...\nI'm really sorry.
TW_11_17	{[0109|000c0c05]}If you're going out to the waterfall,\nremember that there are some\ndangerous things there. Creepy, crawly\nthings. You'll need to carry a {color[0000]}sword{color[ffff]}.\n{[0113]}{[0109|00090c00]}{[010a|002000cd]}I think I saw the{color[0003]} Knight Commander {color[ffff]}go\ninto the Sparring Hall a while ago.\nYou should go ask him if you can\nborrow one!
TW_11_18	{[0109|00000c05]}Listen. As an upperclassman, I've got\nsome advice for you. There's something\nyou should always do before you\ngo somewhere dangerous.\nYou should find a bird statue and {color[0000]}send\nyour prayers to the goddess to save\nyour progress{color[ffff]}. Make it part of your\nroutine!\nThe {color[0000]}bird statues{color[ffff]} you can pray to are\nmarked on your map. It should be easy\nto find one.
TW_11_19	{[0109|0c000800]}{[0106|fbcd]}...{[0106|00cd]}Do you think you'll make it in time,\n{[0200]}?\n\n\n{[0109|0c000e06]}I'm such a wimp{[0106|fbcd]}...{[0106|00cd]} I'm so sorry.
TW_11_20	{[0109|0c010900]}{[0106|fbcd]}......{[0106|00cd]}
TW_11_21	{[0109|00000c01]}{[0301]}{[0200]}! Perfect timing.
TW_11_24	{[0109|00080c00]}Go on!{[0104|0023]} Tell him the truth.
TW_11_25	{[0108|02cd]}Over here!{[0108|00cd]}\n\n\n\n{[010a|000300cd]}I have some information about\nyour Loftwing. Come over here!
TW_11_26	{[0109|00000001]}What are you doing out here\nso late?!\n\n\n{[0109|000c0c09]}You what?! You can't seriously think\nyou're going to ride your Loftwing at\nthis time of night, do you?!\n\n{[0109|00090c00]}Listen up. Loftwings can't fly at\nnight! They have terrible night vision,\nand only the few who have received\nspecial training can fly in the dark.\n{[0109|00080400]}If you really need to fly, you'll just\nhave to wait for daylight.
TW_11_27	{[0109|00000004]}You can't go flying at night.\nYou just can't.\n\n\nIf you want to go out flying, tuck\nyourself into bed and sleep until\ntomorrow morning.
TW_12_01	{[0109|00080901]}Good morning, {[0200]}!\nGood luck in the {color[0000]}Wing Ceremony\n{color[ffff]}today!\n\n{[0109|00000400]}Just think: if you win today, you'll\nbecome a {color[0000]}senior{color[ffff]} like us and you'll be\na very big step closer to graduating as\na {color[0000]}knight{color[ffff]}.\n{[0109|00080900]}You'll even get a {color[0000]}knight's uniform{color[ffff]} like\nI'm wearing. Something tells me you'll\nbe pretty handsome in it!\n\n{[0109|000b0713]}But still not as dreamy as...him...
TW_12_02	{[0109|00010406]}Oh! It's you, {[0200]}... Say,\nyou look all flustered. Did something\nhappen?\n\n{[0109|00080d00]}What?! {[0104|0028]}You can't find your Loftwing?\n\n\n\n{[0109|000c0d12]}Umm{[0106|fccd]}...{[0106|00cd]} I don't know what to tell you.\nI've been here at school the whole time.
TW_12_03	{[0109|00080406]}Huh?{[0104|0028]} Why do you want to know where\n{color[0003]}Groose {color[ffff]}hangs out?\n\n\n{[0109|00000d00]}Is he up to no good again?\n\n\n\nI{[0109|000c0400]} have no clue where he hangs out.\n{color[0003]}Pipit{color[ffff]} probably does, though.\nYou should talk to him.\n\n{[0109|00080e04]}And I think he was looking for you\njust now{[0106|fccd]}...{[0106|00cd]} He should be in front of the\n{color[0000]}Sparring Hall{color[ffff]}.
TW_12_04	{[0109|00080900]}If you win today's {color[0000]}ceremony{color[ffff]}, you'll\nbecome a {color[0000]}senior {color[ffff]}like us. Good luck!
TW_12_05	{[0109|000a0e56]}{[0108|ffcd]}Don't men open doors for a lady anymore?\nHow long am I supposed to stand here waiting\nfor a little chivalry?! Ugh...
TW_12_07	{[0109|00000006]}{color[0003]}Pipit{color[ffff]} should be in front of the {color[0000]}Sparring\nHall{color[ffff]}. You know, at the back of the\nKnight Academy.
TW_13_01	{[0109|00000001]}Look at this thing. Who knows how long\nthis statue has been here?\n\n\nAnd it only has one eye. Poor thing...\nYou probably know this, but you\ncan press {[0204|10cd]} to look around!{[0111|08cd]}
TW_14_01	{[0109|00000002]}That boy really gets me steamed!\nIt's nearly time for dinner, and he's\nnowhere to be seen! He'd better not\nbe chasing bugs again.
TW_14_02	{[0109|00000004]}Mmm-MMM! Another day, another\ntasty soup!
TW_15	{[0109|00000007]}Where are you going with that?\nThat's no use to me there!\n\n\n{[0109|00001200]}Stop fiddling around, and finish what\nyou came to do!
TW_16_01	{[0109|000c0d14]}I can't believe Zelda fell off her bird\nand then down through the clouds.\nShe's so good at riding her bird...\n\n{[0109|000a0d06]}You saw a ghost?! Are you sure you\nweren't just in shock and maybe\nimagined it?

They've been in there\na loooong time...
TW_16_03	{[0109|00080d57]}You need to talk to me? Just come find\nme sometime during the day tomorrow.
TW_16_04	{[0109|00000e12]}This letter from Cawlin... I don't know\nwhat to do about it!\n\n\n{[0109|000b0e00]}What will Pipit think if he finds out\nabout this?
TW_16_05	{[0109|00080909]}Ah! {[0301]}{[0200]}! Thank you\nso much! I'm so happy now...and it's\nall because of you.\n\nMy guy is going out on patrol again\ntonight. It's not even required of\nhim—it's just something he feels he\nhas to do...\n{[0109|000e090a]}Just thinking about him makes my\nheart start pounding like I just ran\nup a flight of stairs!
TW_22	{[0109|00000001]}Oh, you're taking off on your journey\nnow? {[0104|0014]}Then you probably won't be\neating here for a while!\n\n{[0109|000a0c00]}Well, take care of yourself!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00090800]}Make sure you come home every now\nand then. Nothing like a good sleep in\nyour own bed.
TW_22_01	{[0109|00000001]}These past few days, I swear I hear\na voice every time I walk past the\n{color[0000]}restroom at night{color[ffff]}.\n\nWho in the world is in there? I just\nwish they'd pipe down!
TW_22_02	{[0109|00000001]}I don't hear any voices coming from\nthe restroom anymore.\n\n\nBut now Cawlin has been crying\nhimself to sleep in Groose's room...\nIs there anything we can do?
TW_22_03	{[0109|00000001]}I don't hear that voice from the\nrestroom anymore. I wonder who\nit was...
TW_22_04	{[0109|00000001]}How are things? Now that you're here,\nyou should find yourself a {color[0000]}bed {color[ffff]}to lie\ndown in and take a rest.
TW_22_05	{[0109|00000001]}I haven't seen Groose around recently.\nI wonder how that boy's doing.
TW_23	{[0109|00000002]}Watch your step there! You can't\nalways depend on knights like me to\nswoop in and save you.
TW_23_01	{[0109|00000002]}Watch your step there! Haven't they\ntaught you at the academy that knights\nmust always be vigilant? Sharpen up,\nor you'll never make it to knighthood!
TW_57	{[0109|00000002]}Watch your footing out there! In the\ndark you never know when you might\ntake a wrong step off a ledge.\n\nOh, and don't let me catch you going\nout flying at night. Only trained\nknights such as myself should be doing\nthat. You take care now!
TW_57_01	{[0109|00000002]}Whoa there, trainee! You'll never be\npromoted to full knighthood if you\ncan't learn to keep your wits about you.\n\nOh, and don't let me catch you going\nout flying at night. Only trained\nknights such as myself should be doing\nthat. You take care now!

You'll have \na good view of the whole town from \nway up there.
TW_57_03	{[0109|00000057]}What's up, {[0200]}? You\nseem to be in a hurry...\n\n\nWhat's this about your bird?

SP_04	It pains me to tell you, friend, but...\n\n\n\nIt appears your pouch is full. May I\nsuggest you stow some of your\nbelongings at the Item Check?
SP_05	Ahhhh, it pains me to say this, but...\n\n\n\nI believe you are already carrying\nyour limit for this item. Perhaps you\ncould turn your attention to any of\nmy other magnificent wares...

That's a {color[0005]}{[0201|0074]}{color[ffff]}.\nYou can use it to block and repel\nattacks!\n\nYou must be careful, though, as it will\n{color[0000]}break {color[ffff]}if it takes too much abuse.\n\n\nOh, and don't forget about fire.

No\npainful zaps! Plus, it will automatically\nrepair itself when it sustains damage!\n\nIt's a little fragile, but that shouldn't\nbe a problem for one as talented and\nagile as yourself! \n\nAt a cost of {color[0000]}500 Rupees{color[ffff]}, it's an\ninvestment...but an excellent one!\nCare to buy it?\n{[0100|ffff]}OK! {[0101|0000]}No, thanks.

SP_36_01	My friend...you don't appear to have\na slingshot.\n\n\nI simply couldn't sell you these in good\nconscience if you do not have a\nslingshot. Perhaps I can interest you\nin some of my other wares...
SP_37	{[0109|00000002]}That's a {color[0005]}{[0201|0080]}{color[ffff]}.\nWith this in your pouch, you can\ncarry 10 additional seeds.\n\nRecommended for slingshot\nenthusiasts! It costs {color[0000]}100 Rupees{color[ffff]}.\nDo we have a deal, friend?\n{[0100|ffff]}OK!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
SP_38	{[0109|00000002]}That's a {color[0005]}{[0201|0083]}{color[ffff]}. With\nthis in your pouch, you can carry five\nmore arrows!\n\nPerfect for anyone enamored with\narchery! It costs {color[0000]}150 Rupees{color[ffff]}.\nDo we have a deal, friend?\n{[0100|ffff]}OK! {[0101|0000]}No, thanks.

ZEL_01_01	{[0301]}{[0200]}, I'm going to tend to\nmy bird and make sure he's not hurt.\nI'll catch up with you later.\n\n{[0109|00000500]}Go and see if anyone in town knows\nwhat happened to your Loftwing.
ZEL_02_01	Hey, {[0200]}, I was hoping\nI'd find you here.\n\n\n{[010a|001700cd]}I heard you'd gone searching for your\nbird around the waterfall, so I thought\nI'd fly around and help you look.\n\nHow's your search going? Any sign of\nyour Loftwing?
ZEL_02_01a	{[0109|01000514]}Oh no...\n\n\n\n{[0109|01000c00]}Well, let's not lose hope yet. There's a\nplace up ahead that Groose and his\ngang are always hanging around.\nMaybe we'll find something there!
ZEL_02_05	Oh{[0104|0014]}, sorry, {[0200]}. I got\ndistracted for a moment. Let's go!
ZEL_02_06	{[0106|fccd]}Huh...?{[0106|00cd]}
ZEL_02_07	{[0109|01001500]}Who... Who's that?\n\n\n\n{[0109|01001500]}Who's calling for me?
ZEL_03_01	Look! There he is!
ZEL_03_02	{[0109|00090500]}{[0108|01cd]}No doubt about it. That's your\nLoftwing, {[0200]}!
ZEL_04_01	{[0109|00000006]}What're you waiting around for,\n{[0200]}? Let's go get\nyour Loftwing!
ZEL_04_02	{[0109|000f0513]}That's so cruel! They've boarded him\nup in there!\n\n\n{[0301]}{[0200]}, can you do something to\nget all those planks out of the way?
ZEL_04_05	{[0109|00000004]}OK, let's try this again, shall we?\nThis time you won't have me to push\nyou over the edge, so gather up some\ncourage and JUMP!\nJust {color[0004]}dash {color[ffff]}off the edge to leap into\na dive.\n\n\nOh, and just before you land, be sure\nyou press {[0204|29cd]} to open up your\nSailcloth and slow your fall, or it's\ngoing to be an ugly landing...{[0111|0fcd]}\nAnd don't forget that you've got to\nland in the {color[0000]}middle of that round\ndesign in the courtyard below{color[ffff]}!
ZEL_04_06	{[0109|00001514]}Oh boy, I see you messed up your\nlanding.\n\n\n{[0109|00000c00]}Remember, {color[0000]}once you dive {color[ffff]}off the edge,\nyou can control the angle of your fall\nby {color[0004]}tilting {color[ffff]}your body.

Then, just before you hit the\nground, press and hold {[0204|29cd]}!{[0111|0fcd]}\n\nOh, and don't forget that you've got to\nland in the {color[0000]}middle of that round design\nin that courtyard below{color[ffff]}.
ZEL_06_01	{[0109|000c0e09]}Your Loftwing really is amazing.\nEspecially considering everything the\npoor guy has been through this\nmorning.\n{[0109|00000c00]}I'm going to fly back and tell Father\nwhat happened.
ZEL_06_02	{[0109|04000004]}Well, well, if it isn't {[0200]}!
ZEL_06_02a	{[0109|04000000]}Word around the plaza is you found\nthat dumb bird of yours.\n\n\n{[010a|000b00cd]}Well, that's just great. Because you and\nyour dumb bird can't tell time, all the\nprerace warm-ups me and the guys did\nwere for nothin'. Now I'm all stiff.\nWe've been waiting forever for the\nrace to start, and they delay it for\nyou? I don't get it. The big flake gets\nspecial treatment?
ZEL_06_03	You're almost a man, and yet you still\ncan't seem to go anywhere without\nZelda.\n\nI bet you can't even decide what to\nhave for lunch on your own, huh?\n\n\nAnd don't think we haven't noticed the\nsmug looks. “Ooh, Zelda and I are \nBEST friends. We go everywhere\ntogether." Ugh!\n{[0106|fccd]}...{[0106|00cd]}You think you're pretty suave,\n{[0109|04000017]}don't you?{[0104|003c]} {[0109|040b0aff]}Well? Don't you?!
ZEL_06_04	{[0109|0500000e]}Groose has been going on forever\nabout how he's gonna be the one to\nbe with Zelda. He's really got his\npompadour in a ruffle about her!
ZEL_06_05	{[0109|06000014]}Der her her.
ZEL_06_06	{[0109|040d0b00]}I hate to break it to you, but today's\nthe day I bust up this adorable little\nfantasyland you're living in.\n\n{[0109|04000b00]}Zelda's playing the role of the goddess\nat today's ceremony, and I'm gonna be\nthe one to claim that {color[0005]}Sailcloth{color[ffff]}.\n\nWhen I heard she made it herself, man,\nno way was I gonna let some scrawny\nclown snatch that prize from me.
ZEL_06_07	{[0109|04041700]}Oh yes, that Sailcloth—Zelda's\nSailcloth—will be mine! Duh huh huh...\n\n\nOh, man, I bet she was thinking about\nme when she was stitching it...\n\n\nYup, I can see it now. First, I win the\nbig race, and then Zelda and I finish\nthe ceremony together on the statue.\nJust the two of us...\nIt'll be our special moment alone.\nNobody is stopping me and Zelda from\nhaving our moment. Oh, it's so real\nI can... I can see it...
ZEL_06_07b	Duh... Duh huh huh huh!\nOh yeah...
ZEL_06_08	Groose! Pssst, Groose!\n{[0104|001e]}Behind you!{[0104|001e]} Right behind you!
ZEL_06_09	{[0109|04000000]}{[010a|000b00cd]}WHAT?! Can't you two see I'm in the\nmiddle of—
ZEL_06_10	{[0109|04191715]}GAH!
ZEL_06_11	Care to explain just what you meant\nby “our special moment alone"?
ZEL_06_12	{[0109|04ffff0d]}I...uh, nothing big, really. Just...\nJust...\n\n\n{[0301]}{[0109|04000000]}{[0200]}! Yeah, I was just\ntelling my buddy here how glad I was \nhe found that red bird of his. Boy,\nam I looking forward to a fair race!
ZEL_06_12_01	{[0109|04000000]}Anyhow, later, Zelda. Look for me\nduring the race. I'll be the one\npulling off all the dangerous moves.
ZEL_06_13	{[0109|05050013]}{[0109|06070000]}Hey, Groose!{[0105|00140000]} Wait up!
ZEL_06_14	{[0109|00091014]}Did you hear that guy? A fair race? \nYeah, the chances of that happening\nare just about less than zero.\n\n{[0109|0000ff00]}Either way, don't let those fools get\nyou down, {[0200]}! Just get\nout there and fly the best you can!\n\nI know you've got these guys beat, and\ndeep down I think you do too.\n{[0100|ffff]}Yeah!{[0101|ffff]}I dunno...{[0102|ffff]}Us? Alone?
ZEL_06_15	{[0109|000c0e00]}That's the spirit, {[0200]}!\nTrust me—you can win this.
ZEL_06_16	{[0109|000c1500]}Aww, don't be nervous. You can do this!
ZEL_06_17	{[0109|00100e04]}Come on, {[0200]}! Try to \nfocus for once.
ZEL_06_18	The Wing Ceremony will now begin!\nParticipating students, please\nassemble!
ZEL_06_19	Looks like it's race time. Good luck,\n{[0200]}!
ZEL_08	{[0301]}{[0200]}, let's run your bird\nthrough the basics just to\nmake sure he's not hurt.
ZEL_08_01	You can fly your bird in any direction.\nWhen it's headed upward, it'll slowly\nlose speed.\n\nWhen you want to {color[0000]}speed up{color[ffff]}, direct your\nbird upward to gain {color[0000]}altitude{color[ffff]}, then drop\ninto a fast dive!\n\nSo, again, gain some altitude, then dive\nto speed up! Those are the basics of\ngetting your bird up to top speed.
ZEL_08_02	So how's he handling? Do you think\nhe's flying all right?
ZEL_08_03	While riding your Loftwing, you\ncan press {[0204|13cd]} at any time to go over\nthe basic controls again.{[0111|0bcd]}\n\nYou can also {color[0004]}charge{color[ffff]}, which is an attack\nthat also gives you a {color[0000]}burst of speed{color[ffff]} as\nwell as {color[0000]}slow down{color[ffff]} when you need to. Try\nall these moves and see how they feel!
ZEL_08_04	Here's a tip for how to really {color[0000]}build\nup some speed {color[ffff]}on your bird,\n{[0200]}!\n\nGain some altitude, and when you are\n{color[0000]}high{color[ffff]} enough, go into a dive to increase\nyour speed. Climb and dive. Got it?\nThat's how you increase your speed!
ZEL_09	Well, that's a huge relief! I don't know\nabout you, {[0200]}, but your\nLoftwing looks like he's flying great.\n\nMy father and the others are probably\nworried about your bird, so let's go\ngive them the good news!
ZEL_11	{[010d|1906]}{[0108|01cd]}{[0301]}{[0200]}!
ZEL_14_01	This is Zelda's journal. One of the \nentries is unfinished.\nRead the entry?\n{[0100|ffff]}Read it!{[0101|0000]}Don't read.
ZEL_14_02	You've chosen not to read her journal.
ZEL_14_03	Tomorrow's the big day! The Wing\nCeremony! Finally, {[0200]}\ncan take a big step toward becoming\na knight.\nI can't wait to see him promoted\nto full knighthood, but I'm a little\nworried he might have some trouble\nwinning the race.\nLately, {[0200]} hasn't taken\nhis flight training seriously. Someone\nneeds to make sure he doesn't mess up\nhis chance!\nSo I've made up my mind. Tomorrow\nI'll wake him up extra early and make\nsure he gets in some last-minute\npractice, whether he likes it or not.\nHe has to win, or we won't be able to\nperform the closing ceremony\ntogether!

Dai_01_01	{[0109|00000005]}Don't worry, {[0200]}—I'll be\nsure to explain your predicament to\n{color[0003]}Instructor Horwell{color[ffff]}.{[0104|000f]} Go find him and\nask him to meet me in my quarters.\nWhile we chat, why don't you go ask\nsome of the other students about your\nbird? I seem to recall a few of them\nwere gathered near the plaza.
Dai_01_01_1	{[0109|00000001]}Ah, hello, {[0200]}. Have you\nmanaged to find your Loftwing yet?\n\n\n{[0104|0028]}You suspect that {color[0003]}Groose{color[ffff]} had a hand in\nyour bird's disappearance? I tell you,\nthat boy is always up to trouble.
Dai_01_01_2	...Headmaster, if that is true, then all\nthe better. Groose has made it that\nmuch easier to delay the start of\nthe race.\nI doubt even Groose will have the gall\nto complain openly, considering it's his\nfault we had to delay in the first place.
Dai_01_01_3	I see. Yes, he has painted himself into\na bit of a corner, hasn't he? Well, it's\nsettled then.\n\n{[0301]}{[0200]}, don't worry about\nthe race starting without you. Take the\ntime you need to find your Loftwing.
Dai_01_01_4	{[0109|00000005]}Still can't find your bird?\n\n\n\nCalm yourself and use your head.\nI'm sure you'll find a lead to his\nwhereabouts soon.
Dai_03_01	{[0109|00000005]}Quite a number of inexplicable things\nseem to be happening here...\n\n\nWhat might happen if you do as that\nstrange being asks?
Dai_03_11	{[0109|00000001]}I hear your sparring instructor,\nthe {color[0000]}Knight Commander{color[ffff]}, also knows\nthat you will set out from Skyloft. \nHe's concerned for you.\nWhy don't you consider stopping by\nthe Sparring Hall and speaking with\nhim before you go?\n\n{[0301]}{[0200]}...be safe out there.\nI'm counting on you to find Zelda!
Dai_03_12	{[0109|00000002]}Ah, {[0200]}! How goes your\nsearch? Have you found any leads as\nto Zelda's whereabouts?\n\nI feel terrible forcing you to face this\ntask alone, but we mustn't let the\nrest of the village catch wind of what\ntranspired that awful night.\nIf the truth of what we saw that night\nwas exposed to the village, it could\ncause mass confusion amongst the\npeople here.\nI'm afraid this mission has to fall to\nyou alone. Good luck, and may the\nwinds be at your back. 
Dai_03_13_0	You're back, {[0200]}!\nGood to see you're still in one piece.\n\n\nSo, how's it going down there? Are you\nany closer to finding my Zelda? 
Dai_03_13_1	{[0109|00000005]}Hmm... I see{[0106|fbcd]}...{[0106|00cd]} My dear Zelda... \nThings must be terribly trying for her\ndown there.\n\nAnd it can't be easy for you now either,\ncan it?
Dai_03_13	What?{[0104|0028]} You want to know the lyrics to\nthe song Zelda sang on the day of the\nWing Ceremony?\n\nYou know, I'm not much of a singer...\n{[0100|ffff]}Just lyrics!{[0101|ffff]}Sing it!
Dai_03_14	Listen—as I said, I wouldn't feel \ncomfortable serenading you. But if it's\nthe lyrics you're after, I can recite\nthem for you. Let's see...
Dai_03_15	You just want the lyrics? Oh! What a\nrelief. You really put me on the spot\nthere for a moment. I believe the lyrics\ngo something like this...
Dai_03_16	{color[0002]}{[0106|fccd]}Oh youth, guided by the servant of the\ngoddess...unite earth and sky, and\nbring light to the land.{color[ffff]}{[0106|00cd]}\n\nThat's the first part, but as I recall,\nthere's a second verse to the song.\n\n\n{color[0002]}{[0106|fccd]}Oh youth, show the two whirling sails\nthe way to the Light Tower...and\nbefore you a path shall open, and a\nheavenly song you shall hear.{[0106|00cd]}{color[ffff]}
Dai_03_17	I believe that's the whole thing.\n\n\n\nThe {color[0000]}Light Tower{color[ffff]} mentioned in the song\nis a real place; I'm sure you've seen the\ntower in the plaza. I don't know a thing\nabout two whirling sails though{[0106|fecd]}...\nIt sounds like the song is suggesting\nthat if one shows these whirling sails\nthe way to the tower, something will\nhappen?\nBut how do you go about doing that,\nand what does it mean? {color[0000]}Two whirling\nsails{color[ffff]}. Hmm{[0106|fecd]}...
Dai_03_18	Guide the two great whirling sails\ntoward the Light Tower. The youth who\ndoes so shall be led to the place where\nsongs of legend dwell. \n{[0301]}{[0200]}, these lyrics have\nbeen passed down through countless\ngenerations here in Skyloft.\n\nThere's a strong probability that the\n{color[0000]}two whirling sails {color[ffff]}the song mentions\nmust also exist somewhere in Skyloft.\n\nBear in mind, this is only a wild theory,\nbut hopefully some of this will prove\nuseful in your search.
Dai_06	{[0301]}{[0200]}, you're the only hope\nZelda has now. I'm counting on you.\n\n\nFind her, and bring her home safe as\nquickly as you can!
Dai_06_01	Ah, hello, {[0200]}! Have you\nheard anything more about my\ndaughter?\n\nWhat is it{[0106|fecd]}...{[0106|00cd]}? If you know anything at\nall, I urge you to share it with me.
Dai_06_02	{[0106|fecd]}...{[0106|00cd]}You want to tell me but you can't?\nHmm. I...understand. I'm sure you\nhave good reason for keeping quiet{[0106|fecd]}...
Dai_06_04	{[0301]}{[0200]}, I've been doing\nsome thinking since we last spoke.\n\n\nYou have had this destiny thrust upon\nyou without warning...or choice, for\nthat matter. But I wish to help you as\nbest I can.\nI'm getting older, and I lack the\nvigor of youth{[0106|fecd]}...{[0106|00cd]}but even old men\nhave ways of being useful, too!\n\nI wish to share as much of my\nknowledge with you as I can!\n\n\nIf you have any question...any question\nat all about Skyloft or its history, I will\nbe glad to tell you all that I know.\n{[0100|ffff]}Actually...{[0101|ffff]}Not now.
Dai_06_03	What do I know of the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}{[0106|fecd]}...{[0106|00cd]}?\n\n\n\n{[0301]}{[0200]}, where did you hear\nthat word?\n\n\nIt's true that the ancient texts make\nseveral mentions of the Triforce\nwithin their pages.\n\nUnfortunately, the actual location of\nthe Triforce isn't illuminated in\nany of those tomes. Its whereabouts\nare lost to history.
Dai_06_05	So you have no need for the wisdom of\nan old man like myself?\n\n\nWell, just remember that the wisdom\nof years can prevail where youth alone\nmight fall short. If you desire my help,\nI'll be here.
Dai_06_06	Sorry, {[0200]}. It shames me\nto say it, but my knowledge is of little\nuse on this subject.
Dai_06_07	{[0109|00000002]}Do I know anyone else who might know\nmore about the Triforce?\n\n\nWithin Skyloft? No, I doubt anyone\nelse in town would know much about a\nsubject as ancient and archaic as that...
Dai_06_08	I see. So Levias is possessed...\nThe Spiral Charge is a high-risk\nmaneuver, so make sure you know\nwhat you're doing when you unleash it!
Dai_06_09	{[0109|00000002]}It's happened, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\nThe goddess...{[0104|001e]} The goddess and her\nisle have vanished from Skyloft!\n{[0100|ffff]}The truth is...{[0101|ffff]}Err...
Dai_06_10	No need to explain, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\n{color[0002]}When all catastrophes are overcome,\nonly then will the goddess make her\nreturn to the surface.{color[ffff]}\n\nThese are the last of the {color[0000]}secret words{color[ffff]}\npassed down here in Skyloft.{[0104|0014]} It is only\nnow that I realize the significance of\nthem. Yes...\nTheir meaning is clear to me. This must\nmean it's all over...{[0104|0014]} And my Zelda...{[0104|000a]}\nshe's safe at last?\n{[0100|ffff]}I'm sorry.{[0101|ffff]}No.
Dai_06_16	And...whatever other surprises fate\nmay have in store for you, I'm sure you\nwill triumph. We're counting on you\nafter all!\nJust stay focused on the task at hand. \nPut all your strength into it, and you\ncan't go wrong!
Dai_06_12	{[0109|00000004]}I have faith that you shall bring my\ndaughter back to me. I desire that\nmore than an explanation of whatever\nit was that transpired here!\nGood luck, {[0200]}!
Dai_06_11	Amazing! So you've not only calmed\nthe senseless rage that gripped\nLevias, but you've also discerned the\nlocation of the Triforce as well?\n{[0301]}{[0200]}, lately you've grown\nso much that I feel as though I am\nlooking at a different person each\ntime we meet.\nMany troubles still await you, no doubt,\nbut I'm confident you shall overcome\nany obstacle that stands in your way.\nMay the goddess protect you!
Dai_06_13	{[0109|00000002]}Hello, {[0200]}! I hope your\nsearch is progressing well.\n\n\nYou need to find somewhere to insert\nthis {color[0000]}{[0201|00b4]}{color[ffff]}, you say?\n\n\nThat gem...yes, I do believe I have seen\nsomething that it might fit into, but I\njust can't recall where...
Dai_06_14	{[0109|00000004]}I'm quite certain I've seen a stone like\nthat before, but I don't recall where.\n\n\nPerhaps the town fortune-teller might\nbe able to put you on the right track?
Dai_06_15	{[0109|00000004]}I could've sworn I heard the most\nthunderous noise outside a moment\nago.\n\nWell, it's probably just these old ears\nplaying tricks on me. Don't let me hold\nyou up. I'm counting on you to bring\nZelda back!
Dai_07_01	{[0301]}{[0200]}, just a moment!
Dai_07_02	Though, there is one whose vast\nknowledge may be of use...\n\n\nSurely you're familiar with {color[0003]}Levias{color[ffff]}, the\ngreat{color[0000]} sky spirit {color[ffff]}who has guarded our\nrealm for ages?\n\n{[010a|000200cd]}Levias has served as the protector\nof our skies for a long time, and his\nknowledge of our world is\nencyclopedic, to put it mildly.\nIf anyone in the entirety of Skyloft and\nbeyond were to know about the\nTriforce, it would be him.\n{[0100|ffff]}Where is he?{[0101|ffff]}Encyclopedic?
Dai_07_03a	Yes... I feared that might be your next\nquestion. About that...
Dai_07_03b	Yes, his knowledge is almost limitless,\nbut I fear meeting him may be harder\nthan you anticipate...
Dai_07_03	I imagine in your travels you've taken\nnotice of the tremendous {color[0000]}thunderhead{color[ffff]}\nthat suddenly appeared in our skies.\n\nRecently, I've heard rumors suggesting\nthat Levias is trapped inside that\nmassive cloud.\n
Dai_07_04	I asked {color[0003]}Instructor Owlan{color[ffff]} to look into\nthis troubling cloud in order to\ndetermine if there is any truth to these\nrumors.\nI had meant to inquire about his\nfindings earlier but completely forgot\nabout it after Zelda went missing.\n\n{color[0003]}Instructor Owlan{color[ffff]} can fill me in on the\ndetails later, so why don't you go\nspeak with him yourself and see\nwhat his investigation has revealed?
Dai_07_05	If you wish to know more about\nLevias's current location, speak with\n{color[0003]}Instructor Owlan{color[ffff]}. He should be in his\nchambers next door.
Dai_07_06	{[0109|00000017]}What are you standing around for?\nEveryone's already in the sky! Jump\noff the edge and call your bird!

RIV_02_01	{[0109|0014142d]}Poor Zelda...\n\n\n\nYou... This is your fault, you know.\nYou can barely fly straight, and yet\nsomehow you beat me in the race...\n\n{[0109|000b0a3c]}It should've been me up there with her\nthat day. But I guess now I'll just have\nto be the one to save her!
RIV_02_02	{[0109|0014142d]}Oh, Zelda, where are you?\n\n\n\n{[0109|00001400]}Hey, hotshot! Don't think I don't see\nyou flying in and out of town all the\ntime.\n\n{[0109|00000a3c]}I know what you're up to! You're\ntrying to make sure you find Zelda\nfirst, but it ain't gonna happen!\n\n{[0109|0014142d]}Aww...this is the worst.
RIV_02_03	{[0109|0000002e]}Where's Zelda gone off to? I can't\nstand it anymore...
RIV_02_04	{[0109|0000002d]}It's driving me crazy! I've looked\nabsolutely everywhere, but still no\nZelda.\n\n{[0109|00000003]}I do have one last idea, though.\nHave you seen the lights that popped\nup out of the clouds a few days ago?\n\nSo I say to myself, Groose, that thing\nlooks kinda fishy. Then one day it\nhits me! \n\nWhat if that's Zelda down there, and\nshe's sending me a signal? It's a sign!\nIt says, “Save me, Groose. You're my\nonly hope!"\n{[0109|000b0a3d]}The more I think about it, the more\nsure I get! It's Zelda down there, and I\ngotta go rescue her!\n\n{[0109|00000a00]}Anyhow, don't think about trying to\ngo down there before me.\nI'm her hero, remember?\n\n{[0109|0000142e]}Ugh. I don't even know why I'm talking\nto you. Looking at you just makes me\nfeel sad again.
RIV_03	{[0109|00081f02]}Man, when Groose gets sad, he's\ndownright miserable.\n\n\n{[0109|000e1f00]}He's always in his room sulking, and\nwhen he does come out, he gets angry\nat everyone for no reason! Even me!\n\n{[0109|001a1f00]}The way I hear it, you're the one\nresponsible for Zelda going missing.\nThis is your mess, so you'd better fix it!
RIV_03_01	{[0109|00000002]}Hey, I just checked Groose's room, and\nthe guy is gone. You got any idea where\nhe went?\n\n{[0109|00000d00]}{[0106|fbcd]}...{[0106|00cd]}Maybe he had to run away because\nof his broken heart?{[0104|0032]}{[0109|00000c10]} What a tough\nguy. Heh heh...
RIV_03_02	{[0109|00011f02]}Hey, I just saw the news. Out of all of\nus, how come only you got promoted to\nsenior class? Talk about stupid calls!\n\n{[0109|00081f00]}On top of all that, Groose won't come\nout of his room AND Zelda is missing.\n\n\n{[0109|001a1f00]}It's all your fault! Way to go there,\nbuddy. Some senior-class guy you are!
RIV_04	Hey! Don't you know this is my day to \nget all the glory?
RIV_05	Yeah, you heard him! Let's see how you\nfly with egg on your face.
RIV_06	{[0109|00040501]}So Zelda really fell down and vanished\ninto the clouds?\n\n\n{[0109|00000507]}You were with her, weren't you? What\ngives? Why didn't you do something to\nsave her?
RIV_07_01	{[0109|00001f07]}Look at Groose. Just look at him!\nThe guy is so far down in the dumps, I\nhardly recognize him. It's hard to see\nhim like this!\nIt's all because you let Zelda fall!\nYou messed things up, so you better\nfix them.
RIV_07_02	{[0109|00001f1c]}I'm beginning to wonder if Groose\nis ever going to pull himself out of\nthis nose dive.\n\nSure, it's tough for him, but imagine\nhow I feel having to listen to him\nmoping all the time.\n\n{[0109|00001a0b]}I can't wait to get back to my room...
1-Town\105-Terry.msbt
TERY_01_00	Want to know why I'm on a bicycle?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yeah, why?{[0101|0000]}Not really.
TERY_01_01	{[0107|00000015]}Aren't you a curious one!\n\n\n\nI pedal this bike to generate enough\nelectricity to keep this place in the air!\nPlus, all this pedaling has got me in\nfantastic shape!\nYep, I'd say my lifestyle is pretty\n{color[0003]}ecofriendly{color[ffff]}! But, uh...with you on\nboard, there's plenty of extra weight,\nso I have to pedal as hard as I can...
TERY_01_02	Fine, then. Just don't break my\nconcentration!\n\n\nWith you on board, I have to pedal as\nhard as I can because of all the\nEXTRA WEIGHT...
TERY_01_03	Oh, sorry! {[0106|fecd]}...{[0106|00cd]}I don't mean to be rude!\nPlease have a look around. I've got\nall kinds of great stuff!
TERY_01_04	Oh! You are the wonderful boy who\nfound my {color[0003]}Horned Colossus Beetle{color[ffff]}!\n\n\nTo thank you, you can choose any single\nitem here and I will sell it to you at half\nprice.

TERY_01_06	Ah! Welcome!\n\n\n\nWhat?! You found something?!\nIf I try to talk about it now, we\nmight crash...\n\nWhy don't we talk later this evening?\nYou can rest on that bed over there\nuntil it's night.
TERY_01_07	Oh! Welcome, customer...\n\n\n\nPlease, help me! My {color[0003]}Horned Colossus\nBeetle {color[ffff]}is missing!\n\n\nIt may look like it takes everything\nI've got to keep this place afloat, but I\ncan't get the thought of my poor lost\nbeetle out of my head!

We can talk tonight.
TERY_01_09	Oh! If you want, you can take a nap\non the bed over there. We can talk\ntonight when I can stop pedaling!
TERY_02	{[0107|00000015]}Oh! You've come all this way?\nIt's so rare to have a customer here!\n\n\nBeedle's Airshop has everything you\ncould ever want. Please, take a look\naround!\n\nAnd if you actually buy something,\nthat would be even better!
TERY_05	Oh! Your {color[0000]}pouch{color[ffff]} is full!

TERY_06	Oh no! You don't have enough Rupees!\nLook at my face. If that's your idea of\na joke, I'm not laughing!
TERY_07	Oh! Thank you ever so much! You've\ngiven me the strength to keep pedaling!
TERY_07_01	Oh! It really suits you!
TERY_08	Oh! Please take a look at the other\nthings I have for sale.
TERY_09	Oh! Please wait a moment!
TERY_10	Do you know how heavy you are?!\nI have to pedal extra hard with you\nup here!\n\nThen you have the gall to leave without\nbuying anything? Off with you!
TERY_30	Oh! Unfortunately, that sign means the\nitem is sold out.\n\n\nThanks to you, I've done a lot more\nbusiness than usual, so I'm having\ntrouble keeping the store stocked.
TERY_31	That'll increase the number of items\nyou can carry in your {color[0000]}{color[0005]}Adventure\nPouch{color[0000]} {color[ffff]}by one!\n\nIt has to be the most useful thing\nimaginable for an adventure! And yet\nit costs a mere {color[0000]}300 Rupees{color[ffff]}.\n{[0100|ffff]}I'll take it!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
TERY_31a	That will let you carry one additional\nitem in your {color[0005]}Adventure Pouch{color[ffff]}!\n\n\nIf you're on an adventure, this has to\nbe the most useful thing you can\nimagine. And it's half price just this\nonce! It's yours for {color[0000]}150 Rupees{color[ffff]}.\n{[0100|ffff]}I'll take it!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.

DS_52_02	{[0109|00090908]}Thank you very much! Yes, thank you!\nPlease, please come again!
DS_53	If you have any other potions that\nyou want to infuse, you can bring\nthem to me. I'll be happy to help!
DS_53_01	Ah... I'm afraid this potion can't be\nimproved on. If you'd like to buy some\npotions, please speak with my wife...
DS_54	{[0109|0000000a]}Oh, but...you don't have enough\nmaterials to enhance this potion...\n\n\nI'm really sorry, but...maybe you\ncould choose something else?
DS_55	{[0109|0000000a]}Oh...dear. This is so uncomfortable\nto say, but...you don't seem to\nhave enough Rupees. I'd love to help\nyou, but...you see...

TO_FAY_50	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}... Observe.\nThe {color[0000]}green pillar{color[ffff]} before you is a {color[0003]}column\nof light{color[ffff]}. It marks the point at which\nyou can descend to the surface.
TO_FAY_50_01	You can confirm your current\nlocation on the map. Please see\nwhere you are in relation to Skyloft.
TO_FAY_50_02	It appears that you will be able to reach\nthe surface by passing through the\nportal in the clouds at the column's\nbase.
TO_FAY_51	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I have an update regarding\nthe stone tablet and the resulting\ncolumn of light it created.\n\nThe column of light has appeared to\nthe south of our location, and signs\nindicate that it has created an opening\nin the cloud barrier to the land below.
TO_FAY_51_01	I must also caution you that descending\nto the surface armed only with a sword\nwould result in a decreased probability\nof survival.\nIf you have not already done so, I\nadvise you to purchase a {color[0000]}shield{color[ffff]} and\n{color[0000]}potions {color[ffff]}at the bazaar in preparation\nfor your journey.
TO_FAY_52	{[0112|00000001]}Master, the column of light is visible\nfrom here.
TO_FAY_52_01	Dive off a ledge and call your Loftwing\nfrom here, where you can see the\ncolumn of light.
TO_FAY_52_02	It is time for you to set out on your\nsearch for Zelda. You can call your\nLoftwing with {[0204|11cd]} after you dive off.{[0111|09cd]}
TO_FAY_53	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, I suggest\nyou imbue that crest with the power of\nyour {color[0000]}Skyward Strike{color[ffff]} and then insert\nthe tablet I gave you a moment ago.\nTo gather energy from the heavens\nand charge up a {color[0000]}Skyward Strike{color[ffff]},\n{color[0004]}point your sword skyward{color[ffff]}.
TO_FAY_53_01	I am known as {color[0003]}Fi{color[ffff]}... Please step up to\nthe pedestal and draw the sword.
TO_FAY_53_02	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, please\ninsert the {color[0000]}stone tablet {color[ffff]}you recently\nacquired into the altar.
TO_FAY_54	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}...\n\n\n\nWhen you hit that {color[0000]}Goddess Cube {color[ffff]}with\na {color[0000]}Skyward Strike{color[ffff]} earlier, I was able\nto detect a resulting energy reaction\nabove the clouds.
TO_FAY_54_01	The location I have marked on your\nmap indicates the spot where I sensed\nan energy reaction.
TO_FAY_54_02	I advise you to investigate the area\naround this location.
TO_FAY_55	A seedling planted here would require\nseveral thousand years to mature.\nI would suggest not planting one\nat this location.
TO_FAY_56	A report, {[0112|0000000b]}Master.\n\n\n\nDue to your sword's enhancements, it is\nnow possible to use your {color[0000]}dowsing{color[ffff]} ability\nto detect feelings of gratitude.\n\nI have added {color[0000]}Gratitude{color[ffff]} {color[0000]}Crystals{color[ffff]} to\nyour list of {color[0000]}dowsing{color[ffff]} targets.{[010b|00000004]}
TO_FAY_56_01	A report, {[0112|0000000b]}Master.\n\n\n\nDue to your sword's enhancements, it is\nnow possible to use your {color[0000]}dowsing{color[ffff]} ability\nto detect feelings of gratitude.\n\nI have added {color[0000]}Gratitude{color[ffff]} {color[0000]}Crystals{color[ffff]} to\nyour list of {color[0000]}dowsing{color[ffff]} targets.{[010b|00000004]}
TO_FAY_56_02	However, I sense that you have already\ngathered all of the gratitude possible,\n{[0112|00000002]}Master. Congratulations.
TO_FAY_57	A report, {[0112|0000000b]}Master.\n\n\n\nAnalysis indicates Loftwings cannot\nfly at night. Please return to your bed\nand rest, then depart during the day.
TO_FAY_58	A report, {[0112|0000000b]}Master.\n\n\n\nI have determined that there is a {color[0000]}Trial\nGate{color[ffff]} somewhere among these floating\nislands that can be opened by the\nSong of the Hero.\nI suggest you use your {color[0000]}dowsing {color[ffff]}ability\nto locate it.
TO_FAY_59_01	{[0112|00000001]}Congratulations, Master.\n\n\n\nYou have passed all of the trials.
TO_FAY_59_02	The {color[0000]}{[0201|00b4]}{color[ffff]} you just obtained is\nactually one of a pair, {[0112|00000002]}Master.\n\n\nAnother similar object with a mark\njust like the one you hold exists\nsomewhere on this island.\n\nCombining the two should open the\nway to the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n{[010a|ffff00cd]}I suggest that you search for that\nmatching stone.
TO_FAY_60	{[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}, I have\nmemories of this island.\n\n\nIt is known as the {color[0003]}Isle of Songs{color[ffff]}.\nSigns indicate that it was left here\nfor you by the goddess, {[0112|00000002]}Master.\n\nHowever, I am unable to determine a\nmeans of entering the structure ahead.\nI suggest you investigate the area.
TO_FAY_61	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I have confirmed the location\nof a second opening in the cloud\nbarrier. It is located in the skies to\nthe northeast.\nThis opening will allow you to access a\nnew area on the surface. I suggest\nyou fly there as soon as you complete\nnecessary preparations.
TO_FAY_62	{[0112|0000000b]}I've confirmed the location of a third\nopening in the cloud barrier in the\nsky to the southwest.\n\nIt will allow you to reach a new area on\nthe surface. I suggest going there as\nsoon as you are suitably prepared.
TO_FAY_63	{[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}...\n\n\n\nIt will be necessary for you to learn\nhow to execute the Spiral Charge\nmaneuver in order to rid Levias of\nhis blight.\nOwlan is currently waiting {color[0000]}near the\nbird statue{color[ffff]} in the northeastern part\nof Skyloft. I suggest you go there\nto speak with him.
TO_FAY_64	{[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}...\n\n\n\n{[010a|000d00cd]}This treasure-chest-like object is a\nrelic of ancient times, left by the\ngoddess for her chosen hero.
TO_FAY_64_01	However, I lack any information on\nhow it can be opened at this time.
TO_FAY_64_02	It would appear that each chest\nresponds to the energy released when a\nspecific {color[0000]}Goddess Cube{color[ffff]} is launched\nskyward, releasing its lock mechanism.\nSearch for Goddess Cubes in the lands\nbelow and send them into the air.\nIt is the only way to open these chests.

SHINA_01_01	{[0109|00000001]}So what are you up to? Rushing to get\nsome last-minute bird-riding practice\nin this morning, {[0200]}?\n\nOh? {[0104|001e]}You have someone to meet?\n{[0104|001e]}Ah, {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}'s waiting for you, is she?
SHINA_01_01a	Perfect timing, then!\n\n\n\nYou see, Zelda's father—Headmaster\n{color[0003]}Gaepora{color[ffff]}—has a pet named {color[0000]}Mia{color[ffff]}, and,\nwell...she's scampered off again.
SHINA_01_01b	Look!{[010a|001000cd]} Over there! Do you see her?\n\n\n\n{[010a|ffff00cd]}The headmaster is so busy working\nwith Zelda preparing for the\nceremony...\n\nI thought that maybe I should feed her,\nbut the ceremony is about to start and\nI just put on a fresh set of clothes\nand, well...you see...\n{[0107|ff000000]}Will you help me out and go retrieve\nMia for me?\n{[0100|ffff]}I'm on it!{[0101|ffff]}I'm busy...
SHINA_01_02	{[0109|00000a00]}Ah, I see...\n\n\n\nCan you please tell the headmaster\nthat Instructor Horwell has found Mia\nand that he shouldn't worry?
SHINA_01_03	{[0109|0009040d]}Fantastic! So you'll do it?! I know\nyou're in a hurry, so I really appreciate\nyour taking the time to help.
SHINA_01_03a	{[0109|00090400]}You should be able to climb up\nsomewhere over there. If you hang off\nthat ledge there, you can climb onto\nthe roof from the other side.\n{[0107|ff000000]}I'm terribly sorry, but I know you're\nquite the climber! I really do\nappreciate it.
SHINA_01_05	{[0109|00090400]}So will you help by finding Mia and\nbringing her back to me?\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure!{[0101|ffff]}Nah.
SHINA_01_06	{[0109|000a0404]}Ahhh, I'm so glad Mia is safe.\n\n\n{color[0003]}\n{color[ffff]}{[0109|00000a00]}Such an odd creature, the {color[0003]}Remlit{color[ffff]}.\nShe may look cuddly now, but at night,\nit's another story entirely!\n{[0100|ffff]}Why?{[0101|ffff]}At night?
SHINA_01_07	Hmm... You don't know what happens\nto Remlits at night?\n\n\nIt's frightening, really...
SHINA_01_08	{[0109|00000016]}When night falls here in Skyloft, \ncreatures like this Remlit become\npossessed by an evil force.\n\nAnd monsters that hide in caves during\nthe day make their way out and prowl\nin the dark of night.\n\nThat is why nobody dares to leave their\nhome at night. Certainly not if they can\navoid it.\n\nIt might be fine for youngsters like \nyou, well trained in the way of the\nknight. You can defend yourself!\n\nBut still, it would be wise to keep\nyour guard up when you're out and\nabout after dark!
SHINA_01_09	{[0109|00000006]}What is it, {[0200]}?
SHINA_01_13	If you dash at the wall from there,\nyou'll be able to {color[0004]}hang {color[ffff]}from the edge!\n\n\nDo be careful when you're hanging\noff the ledge, and keep an eye on\nyour {color[0000]}stamina gauge{color[ffff]}.
SHINA_01_10	{[0109|000f040d]}Nice work! You've brought her back\nsafe and sound!\n\n\n{[0104|0023]}{[0109|00090400]}Sorry for troubling you with this.\nI know you're busy, {[0200]}!\nI suppose I should feed Mia now...
SHINA_01_12	Please tell the headmaster that we\nfound his pet. He should be up by\nthe {color[0000]}Statue of the Goddess{color[ffff]}.
SHINA_01_12_a	I believe Zelda is there with him, so\nyou should hurry along.\n\n\nOh yes, I should give you a reward...\nIt's not much, but please take this.\nEr, don't tell the others.
SHINA_01_14	{[0109|00000001]}What's wrong, {[0200]}?\nYou're looking a little pale...\n\n\nWhat?!{[0104|0032]} Your Loftwing is missing?!\nHow strange and troubling.\nDo you{[0106|fccd]}...{[0106|00cd]}think you can find him?\n\nYou're going to start looking for him\nnow?! How will you make it back in \ntime to fly in the ceremony?!\n\nIt looks like your participation in the\nceremony hinges on {color[0000]}feather{color[ffff]} or\nnot you can find that bird on time{[0106|fccd]}...{[0104|001e]}\n\n{[0109|00000005]}{[0106|02cd]}Ahem. Excuse me...{[0104|001e]}
SHINA_01_15	I'll see what I can do about the\nceremony. You go hurry and find\nyour bird!
SHINA_01_16	I see... So the headmaster has\nsummoned me?\n\n\nAll right then, I'll go speak with him\nimmediately.\n\n\nI still owe you for helping me out\nearlier, so don't worry about the\nceremony for now. You focus on\nfinding your Loftwing!
SHINA_01_17	Maybe that's life's way of getting\nback at you for not listening to your\ninstructors...\n\nAnyway, never mind that... So you say\nthe headmaster is summoning me?\n\n\nIn that case, don't you worry about the\nceremony. Just go find that bird of\nyours!
SHINA_21_01	{[0108|01cd]}Hey, {[0200]}!
SHINA_21_02	{[010a|001200cd]}{[0109|000a0202]}I don't care how good a jumper you\nthink you are. You'll never reach a\nroof by just {color[0004]}dashing{color[ffff]}.
SHINA_21_03	There should be a wooden box up there.\nGrab and move one with {[0204|00cd]}, and use it\nas a platform of sorts.\n\nYou can climb onto a platform by \n{color[0004]}dashing {color[ffff]}or by tilting {[0204|09cd]} for a few\nmoments.
SHINA_02_01	{[0109|00000002]}Your attention, please. At last we are\nready to begin the {color[0000]}Wing C{color[ffff]}{color[0000]}eremony{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nI was beginning to worry that we'd have\nto proceed without {[0200]},\nbut luckily that is no longer a concern.\n\nI'm glad you could all make it. Before\nwe start, I'll explain the rules for\ntoday's competition.
SHINA_02_02	I have attached a small statuette to this\nbird, who I will then release to the\nskies.\n\nOn my signal, {color[0004]}dash {color[ffff]}from the starting line\nand {color[0000]}dive {color[ffff]}off the ledge. Once you are in\nthe air, mount your Loftwing.\n\nRemember to {color[0004]}call your bird{color[ffff]} promptly\nwith {[0204|11cd]} once you dive off the edge.{[0111|09cd]}\n\n\nWhoever catches the bird and claims\nthe {color[0000]}statuette{color[ffff]} will be this year's champion.\n\n\n{[010a|000200cd]}Those are the rules. Simple enough,\nI should think, but do you need to hear\nthem again?\n{[0100|ffff]}Nope!{[0101|ff00]}Again!
SHINA_02_03	{[0109|00000003]}{[0108|01cd]}Excellent.\n\n\n\nAs you well know, today's champion\nwill graduate to the next class, bringing\nhim one step closer to knighthood.\n\nHe will also receive a {color[0000]}gift {color[ffff]}from the\nyoung woman chosen to play the role\nof the {color[0000]}goddess {color[ffff]}in this year's ritual.\n\nToday is a special day for many\nreasons, but it is also the 25th\nanniversary of our fine institution.\n\nTo celebrate the occasion, today's\nchampion shall also receive his gift\nhigh {color[0000]}atop the Statue of the Goddess{color[ffff]}. \n\nI hear the young woman performing\nthe role of the goddess this year has\ncrafted the gift herself.\n\nAnd as you all well know, the role of\nthe goddess this year will be\nperformed by...
SHINA_02_E3_10	{[0109|00000002]}Excellent. Now at last we are ready\nto begin the {color[0000]}Wing C{color[ffff]}{color[0000]}eremony{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nBefore we start, I'll explain the {color[0000]}rules{color[ffff]}\nfor today's competition.
SHINA_02_E3_12	{[0109|00000003]}{[0108|01cd]}Excellent.\n\n\n\nAs you know, today's champion will\nreceive a {color[0000]}gift {color[ffff]}honoring his prowess\n{[0104|0028]}from none other than{[0106|fecd]}...{[0106|00cd]}
SHINA_02_04	{[0109|00000052]}Very well... But listen close this time!
SHINA_02_05	Let's see your finest flying out there.\nShow me just how hard you've\nbeen practicing.\n\nAlso, I want to see good, clean flying.\nAnyone caught interfering with other\nriders will answer to me!
SHINA_02_06	{[0109|00000002]}What are you doing? {color[0004]}Dash {color[ffff]}off the ledge\nwith {[0204|01cd]}, {color[0000]}dive {color[ffff]}down, and get on your\nbird!\n\nRemember, you'll need to press {[0204|11cd]} to\ncall your bird!{[0111|09cd]}
SHINA_02_07	{[0109|00000002]}All right, gentlemen, line up. At my\ncommand, the competition will begin!
SHINA_02_08	{[0109|01000009]}{[0108|01cd]}The lovely Zelda!
SHINA_02_09	{[0108|01cd]}That goes {[0109|04191700]}double for you,\nGroose!
SHINA_03	{[0108|01cd]}Go!{[0105|000f0000]}
SHINA_04	{[010d|1906]}{[0108|01cd]}Hey, {[0200]}!\nUp here!
SHINA_04_01	{[0109|000b0a00]}You should be able to climb up if you\n{color[0004]}dash{color[ffff]} up to the top of that wooden box, \ndon't you think?\n\nThen you can make that jump\nfairly easily!\n\n\nTry climbing up here!
SHINA_04_02	{[0109|0a0e0a01]}Good morning to you,\n{[0200]}! Today's finally\nthe day of the long-awaited\n{color[0000]}Wing Ceremony{color[ffff]}!\nAre you feeling ready? Oh, I just\nremembered. There's something I'd\nlike to ask you about.\n\n{color[0004]}Target{color[ffff]} me, and we can have a quick chat.
SHINA_04_02_2	{[0109|0a0e0a01]}Good morning to you,\n{[0200]}! I'm impressed\nwith your decision to test\nyour resolve in {color[0000]}Hero Mode{color[ffff]}!\nOh, but today's the day of the long-\nawaited {color[0000]}Wing Ceremony{color[ffff]}!\n\n\nAre you feeling ready? There's\nsomething I'd like to talk to you about.\n\n\n{color[0004]}Target{color[ffff]} me, and we can have a quick chat.
SHINA_04_03	{[0109|000b0a0d]}Excellent! Always remember you can\n{color[0004]}target {color[ffff]}someone to talk to them easily.\n\n\nAnd even when there isn't anything to\ntarget, it's a convenient way to quickly\nface your view forward.\n\nOh, but it's a little silly to carry on a\nconversation from this distance.\nWhy don't you come join me up here?
SHINA_04_03_2	{[0109|000b0a0d]}Excellent! Always remember you can\n{color[0004]}target {color[ffff]}someone to talk to them easily.\n\n\n{[0109|00000c04]}You're looking at me like you already\nknow all this. There's no harm in going\nover the basics, you know. \n\n{[0109|00000a00]}{color[0000]}In Hero Mode{color[ffff]}...{[0104|001e]}{[010b|00000004]}you'll {color[0000]}lose hearts\ntwice as fast{color[ffff]}, so it's doubly important\nto know how to effectively {color[0004]}target{color[ffff]}.\n\nOh, but it's a little silly to carry on a\nconversation from this distance.\nWhy don't you come join me up here?
SHINA_04_04	{[0109|000b0a06]}What are you waiting for?!\nListen to your instructor for once!
SHINA_04_05	{[0109|000b0a52]}You can't just ignore your instructor\nlike this, {[0200]}!\n\n\n{color[0000]}Target{color[ffff]} me, then talk with me!
SHINA_04_07	{[0109|000a0a00]}{[0108|02cd]}{[0301]}{[0200]}!\n\n\n\n{[0108|02cd]}You still don't get it?!
SHINA_08_01	{[0109|00000001]}Ah, {[0200]}. How goes your\nsearch for Zelda? Have you found her\nyet?\n\n{[0109|00000005]}What? {[0104|0028]}Levias? Ah, so you've been\ntalking to the headmaster, I take it?\n\n\nIf I'm correct, Levias is the one inside\nthe thunderhead. But{[0106|fecd]}...{[0106|00cd]}{[0104|0019]}that's not the\nLevias that we all know.\n\n{[0106|fecd]}That's...{[0104|0028]}{[0106|01cd]}a {color[0000]}monster{color[ffff]}!\n\n\n\n{[0109|0000000f]}It certainly looks like Levias, but last\ntime I approached him, he came\nrushing at me! And his eyes...\nThey were full of malice.\nPeople change... Or old, wizened\ncreatures change, rather. {[0106|fecd]}Perhaps\nit's more that...{[0106|00cd]}{[0104|0019]}he is possessed by\nsomething. {[0104|0019]}That's how it felt to me.
SHINA_08_02	{[0109|00000005]}What?{[0104|0028]} You want to talk to Levias?\n\n\n\n{[0106|fecd]}That's...{[0106|00cd]}impossible. I don't think\nLevias is capable of listening. Not in\nhis current state, no.\n\n{[0106|fecd]}And...{[0106|00cd]}even if you were to get close\nenough to talk to him, it will likely end\nwith you getting brushed aside and sent\nflying to your death in a sea of clouds.
SHINA_08_03	{[0109|00000001]}Ah, {[0200]}! How's your\nsearch for Zelda going?\n\n\nSorry for leaving it all up to you.\nI know you must be doing everything\nyou can to find her.
SHINA_08_04	{[0109|00000052]}What? {[0104|0028]}You're still planning on going?\n\n\n\n{[0106|fecd]}I see...{[0106|00cd]} It's because you need to find\nZelda.\n\n\nI understand...{[0104|001e]} I get the feeling\nnothing I could say would talk you\nout of it.
SHINA_08_05	Hey! I have an idea. \nCome with me!
SHINA_08_06	{[0109|00000001]}Oh, hello, {[0200]}!\n{[0104|001e]}Hmm? The Triforce?\n\n\nSorry, I can't say I know what that is!\nPerhaps you should ask the\nheadmaster?
SHINA_09_01	{[0109|00000002]}Levias is inside the thunderhead.\nHe's been acting so strangely...\nLike something has possessed him.\n\nIf we can somehow free him from\nwhatever it is that has a hold over\nhim, then there's a chance he will\nreturn to his senses.\nListen well, {[0200]}, because\nI'm about to teach you a very\npowerful bird-riding technique. \n\n{[0109|00000003]}It's called the {color[0000]}Spiral Charge{color[ffff]}!
SHINA_09_02	Using the Spiral Charge, you can rid\nLevias of the blight that has hold\nof him!\n\nThe technique is quite easy to perform.\nAll you have to do is press {[0204|1ecd]}.{[0111|10cd]}\n\n\nHowever, the acceleration effect lasts\nlonger than any {color[0000]}attack{color[ffff]} move you've\nused so far. Maintaining stable flight\ncan be tricky.\nThis is a technique that only senior\nKnight Academy students who have\nmastered high-level flight skills are\nallowed to perform.\nIt's still a bit too early for you, but...\n{[0104|001e]}This is an extraordinary circumstance,\nso I'll make an exception this time.\nHowever, I will test you.
SHINA_09_03	{[0109|00000004]}First, dive off this platform and call\nyour bird.
SHINA_10_01	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}. The day of the\nWing Ceremony is finally upon us!\n\n\nIt's time to put what you've learned to\nuse... All those practical skills I taught\nyou, and all the academic prowess\n{color[0003]}Instructor Horwell{color[ffff]} taught you!\nWhile we're at it, do you remember how\nto {color[0000]}look around {color[ffff]}using {[0204|10cd]}?{[0111|08cd]}\n\n\n{color[0004]}Press{color[ffff]} {[0204|22cd]} when you want to take a look\nat your surroundings!{[0111|08cd]}
SHINA_10_02	{[0109|0000000f]}What's wrong, {[0200]}?\n{[0104|001e]}Your bird won't come to you when\nyou call it?\n\nFor a Loftwing to ignore its master's\ncall...something must be very wrong{[0106|fecd]}...\n\n\nHave you talked to{color[0003]} Instructor Horwell\n{color[ffff]}about this? He's leading today's\nceremony and should be made aware\nof what's going on!\nI see... Well, if the headmaster is aware\nof the situation, then I'm sure he'll \ndelay the ceremony for you.\n\nYou just worry about finding that\nbird of yours!
SHINA_10_03	{[0109|0000000f]}What happened to Zelda...it's just\nterrible.\n\n\nBut there's no point in your kicking\nyourself about it. It was an accident...
SHINA_10_04	{[0109|00000001]}Leave the ceremony to us. You just\nfocus on finding your bird as quickly\nas you can.
SHINA_10_05	{[0109|00000001]}That reminds me... You always seem\nto confuse {color[0003]}Instructor Horwell {color[ffff]}and\nme!\n\nI am {color[0003]}Owlan{color[ffff]}, of course. I have white\nhair, and I teach practical skills.\n{color[0003]}Instructor Horwell {color[ffff]}has brown hair, and\nhe teaches academics. Don't forget it!
SHINA_11	{[0109|00000011]}I heard the news, {[0200]}!\nZelda's fallen down through the clouds,\nand you're going to look for her.\nIs that right?\nThe headmaster told me there's land\nbeneath the clouds... Do you know\nanything about that?
SHINA_11_00	So that's the famous sword... Ah, but\nit won't do you much good if you don't\nhave a shield to protect yourself with!\n\nHere—take this with you!
SHINA_11_05	So that's the famous sword... Ah, but\nit won't do you much good if you don't\nhave a shield to protect yourself with!\n\nUnfortunately, you don't seem to have\nspace to carry any other items. Here,\ntake this instead. Consider it a little\ngift from your friend and teacher.
SHINA_11_01	The Wooden Shield is light and\nmaneuverable, but it's the weakest\nof all the shields. Also, keep in mind\nthat it's particularly vulnerable to fire.\nIf it breaks, you can buy a new one\nat the bazaar.\n\n\nTo equip a shield, {color[0004]}hold {color[ffff]}{[0204|28cd]}, select\nthe shield you want to use, and let\ngo of {[0204|28cd]}.{[0111|0ecd]}
SHINA_11_02	{[0109|00000001]}Take good care of yourself, and best of\nluck in your search for Zelda!
SHINA_11_06	{[0109|00000001]}How goes your search for Zelda?\n\n\n\nRemember to find a bed and sleep if\nyou start getting tired. A quick nap can\nrestore your hearts and refresh your\nmind to explore after dark.
SHINA_11_07	{[0109|00000001]}Could there truly be a world below the\nclouds?\n\n\nShould it even exist, I imagine its\nterrain to be the exact opposite of our\nlush green world. It's probably nothing\nbut dust and rock...
SHINA_11_03	So that's the famous sword... Ah, and\na shield{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]} It looks like you have one\nalready. Very good!\n\nHere—take this as a little gift from me.
SHINA_11_04	If you're not sure how to use a shield,\n{color[0003]}Knight Commander Eagus {color[ffff]}at the\nSparring Hall will happily teach you.
SHINA_12_01	{[0109|0000000a]}Oh! You managed to destroy 10 targets\nwithin the time limit!\n\n\nIf you can control your bird that well,\nyou'll have no problems at all! I knew\nyou could do it, {[0200]}.\nAnd what a magnificent red bird...\nYou are henceforth permitted to use\nthe Spiral Charge attack as a qualified\nbird rider!
SHINA_12_02	The next thing we have to address is\njust how to go about finding Levias.\n\n\nMaybe the {color[0000]}owner of the Lumpy\nPumpkin {color[ffff]}might know something.\nEvery year he makes an offering of\nhis pumpkin soup for Levias.\nGo to the Lumpy Pumpkin and\nask him what he knows!
SHINA_12_03	{[0109|0000000f]}If you can't destroy 10 targets in \nunder 120 seconds, I can't in good\nconscience give you permission to\nuse this dangerous technique.\nI'll be here for a while, so why don't you\ntake a break and cool off? Come talk\nto me when you want to try again. 
SHINA_13_01	{[0109|00000001]}What's wrong?! Hurry up and dive off\nthe platform! Are you having second\nthoughts?\n{[0100|ffff]}I'll do it!{[0101|0000]}I quit.
SHINA_13_02	{[0109|00000001]}The Lumpy Pumpkin is a little\ngathering spot on an oblong island to\nthe southeast of Skyloft.\n\nThe owner's daughter, {color[0003]}Kina{color[ffff]}, works\nthere. She has the most lovely voice.\n\n\n{[0104|001e]}I'm also{[0106|fecd]}...{[0106|00cd]}a fan of hers. But you don't\nneed to tell anyone else about that,\ndo you?
SHINA_13_03	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}! Want to try\nsome Spiral Charge training?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yep!{[0101|0000]}Later.
SHINA_13_04	{[0109|00000003]}Excellent. That's what I want to hear!\nWell then, dive off this platform.
SHINA_13_05	I think it's fine to wait until you feel\nready!\n\n\nI'll be here for a while. Come back\nanytime!
SHINA_13_06	{[0109|00000003]}Ah! That's the answer I was looking\nfor. Take to the skies,\n{[0200]}!
SHINA_15	{[0109|00000002]}Hey, {[0200]}! Where do you\nthink you're going? This is a\ncompetition! Dive off the platform!
SHINA_16	{[0109|00000004]}It's dangerous to be out at night.\nYes, best to avoid it entirely!\n\n\nEven the headmaster's darling Mia\nturns quite feral when night falls...\nA mysterious energy settles over\nSkyloft with the darkness.
SHINA_16_01	{[0109|00000016]}I keep my distance from Mia at night.\n\n\n\nThere was that one time when she\nsnuck into the academy after nightfall.\n\n\nI recommend that you be extra careful\nwhen you go out at night. Oh dear...\nThat caused quite the commotion.
SHINA_16_02	{[0109|0000000d]}Look, {[0200]}! Though night\nhas come, Mia exhibits none of the\nnocturnal aggressiveness we've come\nto expect in Remlits!\nIt's just amazing!
SHINA_16_03	{[0109|00000016]}This gives me pause... The monsters\nthat usually prowl Skyloft at night are\nnowhere to be seen, and the Remlits\nno longer show aggressive behavior.\nWhat could have happened?
SHINA_17	{[0109|00000002]}{[0301]}{[0200]}! Where are you\nheaded?\n\n\nDive off this platform and call your\nLoftwing!
SHINA_18_01	{[0109|00000002]}Ah, {[0200]}! You'd like a\nlesson from me, even at a time like\nthis?\n{[0100|ffff]}Please!{[0101|0000]}No...
SHINA_18_02	I... I see. Well, classes are canceled\ntoday due to the Wing Ceremony!\n\n\nDon't you think you'd better head\noutside and get ready for the\nceremony?
SHINA_18_03	Well, well! Such enthusiasm!\n\n\n\nAllow me tell you about the history of\nSkyloft!\n\n\nSkyloft is an island that has floated\nhere for ages... Thousands of years.\n\n\nOur ancestors have always lived on this \nisland, as well as the surrounding\nislands in the sky.\n\n{[0109|00090a00]}There is an impenetrable barrier of\nclouds below Skyloft. Nobody who has\nfallen down through the clouds has\never been seen again.\nThey say there is a vast expanse of\npure nothingness beneath the clouds!\n\n\n{[0109|000a0a00]}Ah, but that's a good place to leave it\ntoday. You'd better go prepare for the\nWing Ceremony.
SHINA_18_04	{[0109|00000004]}Hey now! That's my seat that you've\nperched yourself on. Students must sit\nin the student seating!
SHINA_20	{[0109|00000001]}Lately I've been taking care of Mia\nfor the headmaster...\n\n\nIt's dangerous having her around.\nShe's so adorable that I'm starting to\nthink I need one of my own!
SHINA_20_01	{[0109|00000001]}I must admit I'm starting to think I\nmight need to get a Remlit of my own.\n{[0104|001e]}The Triforce?! What's that?{[0104|0028]} Does it\nhave anything to do with little Mia?
SHINA_20_02	{[0109|00000001]}Levias?!{[0104|0028]} I've heard rumors about\nwhat's been going on out there, but\nlittle more.\n\nI'm afraid I lack sufficient knowledge\non this subject to be of help to you.\n\n\nGo speak with the head of physical\ntraining, {color[0003]}Instructor Owlan{color[ffff]}. I'm sure\nhe can teach you more about this\nparticular topic!
SHINA_20_03	{[0109|00000001]}It seems every time I bump into you,\nyou appear stronger and somehow\nmore confident. Whatever you're\ndoing, keep it up, {[0200]}.
SHINA_20_04	{[0109|00000001]}While her statue may be gone, the\ngoddess is still with us, for she lives on\nin our hearts. Don't you agree,\n{[0200]}?
SHINA_22_01	{[0109|00000001]}The ceremony won't start until you\nhave found your Loftwing.\n\n\nDon't worry about anything else.\nJust hurry up and find your bird!
SHINA_22_02	{[0109|00000001]}The start of the Wing Ceremony is\nbeing delayed until you find your\nLoftwing. Good news, isn't it?
SHINA_23_01	{[0109|00000001]}You aren't allowed to ride your birds\nat night, so I'm afraid you won't be\nable to search for Zelda then, either.\n\nFor tonight, I suggest you go to bed and\nget some rest. You can start your\nquest tomorrow.\n\nYou won't make smart decisions if\nyou don't take the time to rest your\nmind and body.
SHINA_23_02	{[0109|00000001]}Well, {[0200]}... Are you close\nto finding Zelda?\n\n\nDon't give up! I believe if anyone can\nfind Zelda, it's you.
SHINA_23_03	{[0109|00000005]}{[0301]}{[0200]}... What are you\ndoing out at this hour?\n\n\nWhat's all this about Levias? Listen,\nthis isn't something I want to talk\nabout at this hour...\n\nCome back tomorrow morning. \nI'll tell you everything I know then.
SHINA_23_04	{[0109|00000001]}The Spiral Charge is a stressful\nmaneuver for most any Loftwing to\npull off.\n\nBut you and that red bird of yours...\nI'll bet you can handle it without\na sweat!
SHINA_23_05	{[0109|00000001]}How are things, {[0200]}?!\nIs everything going well?\n\n\nIf there's anything else you need,\ndon't hesitate to come talk to me.\nI am your instructor, after all!
SHINA_24_01	{[0109|00000002]}Hey, {[0200]}! What exactly\ndo you think you're doing ignoring\nyour instructor and just walking by\nlike that?\nCome over here and listen to what your\ninstructor has to say!
SHINA_24_02	{[0109|00000002]}Hey now, {[0200]}! Now is\ncertainly not the time for that.\n\n\nHurry and find your Loftwing!\nYou should talk to the students inside\nthe academy. Perhaps they know\nsomething?
SHINA_24_03	{[0109|00000002]}Hey, {[0200]}! What do you\nthink you're doing slinking by your\ninstructors like that?!\n\nCome here for a moment.
SHINA_30	Listen up, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\nI taught your Loftwing to perform a\n{color[0004]}Spiral Charge {color[ffff]}when you press {[0204|1ecd]}.
SHINA_31	Use the {color[0000]}Spiral Charge {color[ffff]}attack to break\nthe {color[0000]}10 targets {color[ffff]}placed around the\nfloating boulders up ahead.
SHINA_32	If you can destroy 10 targets in under \n{color[0000]}120 seconds{color[ffff]}, I will recognize you as\na skilled bird rider.
SHINA_33	All right! Off you go!

TAKE_01_01	{[0109|00000001]}How's it goin', {[0200]}?\nGood to see you again!\n\n\nHow's that slicin' arm feel? Ready to\nslay some bamboo? It's only {color[0000]}10 Rupees\n{color[ffff]}a shot!\n{[0100|ffff]}I'm in!{[0101|ffff]}Rules?{[0102|0000]}No, thanks.

Look at this nice little\nspace you landed on!\n\n\n{[0109|000d0600]}So you landed on a {[0203|0000000000cd]}-Rupee spot, and\nyour multiplier is {[0203|0000000100cd]}! That means you\nwalk away with a grand Rupee total\nof {color[0000]}{[0203|0000000200cd]}{color[ffff]}!
DIV_01_23	{[0109|00ffff06]}WHOOOPIDDY DOO! You landed on a\n50-Rupee space!\n\n\nYour multiplier is {[0203|0000000100cd]}, so that means\nyou win {color[0000]}{color[0000]}{[0203|0000000200cd]}{color[0000]} Rupees{color[ffff]}! Wowza!

DIV_11	{[0109|0000000f]}Urggggggh... My superwacky party\nwheel of fun fell off the island,\nway down below the clouds...\n\nWithout that, there's just no way...\nThe dream of fun is dead. I can't bring\nmyself to do anything without it.\nThe laughter has turned to tears.
DIV_11_01	{[0109|0000000f]}Urrrrrghhh... What am I going to do?!\nIt's no use! It's all over...\n{[0100|ffff]}What's wrong?{[0101|0000]} Uh...
DIV_11_05	{[0109|0000000f]}Oh...it's nothing, really. I don't want to\nbother you with my shattered dream.\n\n\nIt was just a silly decoration I used\nto pin on to my back, {[0104|000a]}but still...{[0104|000a]}\nIt was MY silly decoration...\n{[0100|ffff]}I'll find it!{[0101|0000]}It's gone.
DIV_11_02	{[0109|00000010]}Without it, I can't help make people\nhappy. The smile factory is shut down.\n\n\n{[0109|000a0c00]}You know...but what can I do?
DIV_11_03	You see, the party wheel that I\npinned to my back flew off the island\nand fell down somewhere below\nthe clouds.\nWithout my party wheel, there's just\nno way I can make this island a place\nwhere people come to have fun!\n\n{[0109|000a0c00]}What can I do? It fell down below the\nclouds, so I guess I should just give up\non it.\n{[0100|ffff]}Look for it!{[0101|0000]}Give up.
DIV_11_04	How am I supposed to go get something\nthat fell below the clouds?\nThat's impossible!
DIV_12	{[0109|000a0c10]}Ugh... It would be so amazing if\nsomeone were to find it. Just think\nof the smiles on the children's faces...\n\nI'm not getting my hopes up, though...
DIV_12_01	{[0109|0000000f]}Hello there, young man. You think\nyou can find my party wheel?\n\n\nNo? I didn't think so...

Do you dare discover what\nfate these eyes see? Only {color[0000]}1 Rupee{color[ffff]}!\n{[0100|ffff]}OK.{[0101|0000]}Maybe later.
FTEL_01_04	{[0109|00000007]}I'm hurt! Is this how you respond to\nkindness?\n\n\nDon't you trust these big, round, \nall-seeing eyes? I might not look on\nyou so favorably next time. Are you\nsure you don't want your fortune told?{[0100|ffff]}Actually...{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
FTEL_01_03	You are stubborn...but I saw that\nfrom across the room. I can also see\non your face that you don't believe in\nfortune-telling.\nGetting your fortune told will aid you\non your path... Aren't you curious\nabout what these large, dewy eyes\nwill behold?\n{[0100|ffff]}OK, OK.{[0101|0000]}No!

FTEL_01_08	{[0109|00090909]}Fine. Fine. I know the time will come\nwhen you wish these round, stupendous\neyes could see your fortune! But\ndon't come running to me!
FTEL_01_09	Ahaaaaaaaaaa. I see many things...\nAll is revealed...
FTEL_01_11	{[0109|00090909]}But what's this?! I see you don't\ncarry even a single Rupee in your\nshriveled wallet. These tantalizing\neyes do not work for free!
FTEL_01_12	{[0109|00090909]}But what's this, young man?! I've just\nhad a vision, and it's telling me you\ndon't have the money to pay me for my\namazing services!\nYou surely aren't asking me, with my\nunfathomable, all-seeing eyes, to tell\nyour fortune for free, are you?!

FTEL_01_13	{[0109|00000012]}That's all I can see for the moment...\nMy eyes, they grow weary. Come see\nme again if you should lose your way.

Gaze deeply into\nmy eyes and come closer!
FTEL_06_01	Yesssss... Treasure, eh? You wish for\nme to gaze into my crystal ball and\nforesee treasure. I must confess,\nI know little about treasure...\nAh well. I guess I can give it a shot.
FTEL_06_02	Yesss... A towering forest... Sandy\ndunes... A blazing mountain...\nMonsters... These are the sources of\ntreasure that I foresee.\nWhich source of treasure do you want\nto hear about?\n{[0100|ffff]}Forest.{[0101|ffff]}Dunes.{[0102|ffff]}Mountain.{[0103|ffff]}Monsters.
FTEL_06_03	Yesss... I see a towering forest...\nTreasures often found in these great\nwoods are {color[0005]}Bird Feathers{color[ffff]} and\n{color[0005]}Hornet Larvae{color[ffff]}...\nI see you finding a{color[0005]} Bird Feather{color[ffff]} by\ncatching a small bird in your net!\n\n\nAnd {color[0005]}Hornet Larvae{color[ffff]}... Oh yesss, you will\nfind them by knocking down hives!\n\n\nAmong all the small bird feathers, I see\none that is highly prized! Yesss, \nthe {color[0000]}Blue Bird Feather{color[ffff]}... It is said to\nbring happiness!\nIf you see one, young man, you are\nvery fortunate!
FTEL_06_04	The land of sands, eh... In the land of\nsands, I see you will find {color[0005]}Tumbleweeds{color[ffff]}.\nYessss... And something called an\n{color[0005]}Ancient Flower{color[ffff]}.\nTo catch a {color[0005]}Tumbleweed{color[ffff]}, I foresee you\nswinging a net quickly just as one\nrolls across your path.\n\nAs the name suggests, I see you can\npick an {color[0005]}Ancient Flower{color[ffff]} only by\ntraveling back to ancient times.
FTEL_06_05	Smoldering and sulfurous...yesss...\nI see a blazing mountain! There you\nwill find...\n\n{color[0005]}Lizard Tails {color[ffff]}and something called\n{color[0005]}Eldin Ore{color[ffff]}! I see it now...\n\n\n{color[0005]}Eldin Ore{color[ffff]} can sometimes be found by\ndigging in the ground, yess... I see\ndirt in your future...\n\n{color[0005]}Lizard Tails{color[ffff]}... I see you claiming this\ntreasure by defeating horrifying\nlizard-like creatures. This vision...\nIt will haunt my dreams!
FTEL_06_06	Monsters. I see monsters... When you\ndefeat a monster, you will often find\none of these...\n\nA {color[0005]}Monster Claw{color[ffff]}, {color[0005]}Ornamental Skull{color[ffff]},\n{color[0005]}Jelly Blob{color[ffff]}, or {color[0005]}Monster Horn{color[ffff]}...\n\n\n{color[0005]}Monster Claws {color[ffff]}come from monsters\nthat flutter and flap in the air!\n\n\n{color[0005]}Ornamental Skulls{color[ffff]} come from human-\nlooking monsters. They are\ndisgusting to behold!\n\n{color[0005]}Jelly Blobs {color[ffff]}come from soft-looking\nmonsters. Oh, how they ooze...
FTEL_06_06b	And {color[0005]}Monster Horns {color[ffff]}come from the\nmonsters who carry them. You can\nclaim them for yourself by using some\nsort of tool to snatch them away.\n{color[0005]}Evil Crystals{color[ffff]} often come from\nmonsters that cast spells. Dark\nmagic... It gives me chills...\n\nAnd rarely, so very rarely...a {color[0005]}Golden\nSkull{color[ffff]} will be found instead of an\nOrnamental Skull.
FTEL_06_07	And then there's the {color[0005]}Amber Relic {color[ffff]}and\nthe {color[0005]}Dusk Relic{color[ffff]}. These can be found in\nevery region, I see...\n\nBut for some reason, the {color[0005]}Dusk Relic\n{color[ffff]}can only be found during some kind\nof trial...\n\nAnd my eyes, they see that the\n{color[0005]}Goddess Plume {color[ffff]}is the rarest of all\ntreasures! If you should find one, you\nwill be the luckiest man alive!
FTEL_07	{[0109|00000002]}Oh no... Er, hang on a second...\n\n\n\nI see you're looking well these days!\nIf I didn't know any better, I'd say\nyou'd found the time to gather all\nvariety of magnificent treasures.\nCome! Come closer! If it's treasure you\nseek, I'll use my mystical vision to find\nanswers for you!
FTEL_30	{[0109|00010701]}Hey! What would bring you here at\nthis hour{[0106|fccd]}...{[0106|00cd]} I'm not open at night. \nCome to my stall in the bazaar at a\nsane hour!
FTEL_31	{[0109|00010703]}Yesss, thanks to you, young man,\nmy life is full of happiness!\n\n\nI have not yet foreseen how your life\nwill fare, but if you'd like to find out,\ncome to the bazaar during the daylight\nhours and we shall see!
AFTER_EVT_01	{[0109|0000000a]}Ahhh! You're that young man from\nbefore!\n\n\nThanks to you, I've been able to return\nto a life of gazing into the future to\ntell people's fortunes!\n\nWhat do you say I tell you yours, hm?\nAnd I'll even cut you a deal... From now\non, it's just half price!
AFTER_EVT_02	{[0109|0000000a]}Yesssss! The young man is here!\nWelcome! I've been waiting!\n\n\nAnd you've got that smirk on your face,\nyesssss... The one that says you want\nme to see what the future will bring!
AFTER_EVT_03	Come now! Let me see into the future\nwith these big, round eyes! And you\nget my special rate—half off!\n\nShall I begin to peer into your future?\nIt'll be {color[0009]}5 Rupees{color[ffff]}. What do you say?\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
FTEL_50_01	Young man, are you about to head into \na densely wooded area? Somewhere\nblanketed in green, yes? Ahhh...\nMy eyes, they see all...\nTrees! Everywhere!{[0104|0014]} Yes. {[0104|000a]}Many trees...\nIt would serve you well to buy a {color[0000]}Wooden\nShield {color[ffff]}before you travel.\n\nI can see that you are a bit young and\ngreen yourself, so it couldn't hurt to\ntake a {color[0000]}Heart Potion {color[ffff]}with you.
FTEL_50_02	Young man, my visions see...\nFlames! Burning! Smoke! Scorching\nheat! This is in your future...\n\nThe thought of taking a Wooden\nShield to such a place is madness...\nIron! You will need an {color[0000]}Iron Shield {color[ffff]}to\nprotect yourself!\nAnd you should also take with you some\n{color[0000]}potions to restore your vitality{color[ffff]}...
FTEL_50_03	I see a place...yes, it's coming into\nfocus now... SAND! Hmm, sand?\nA sandbox? A giant sandbox?\n\nWell, whatever it is, I see it's a desolate\nplace that will cause you troubles with\nelectricity...\n\nIron won't do you any good there. I see\nyou'll need a {color[0000]}Wooden Shield {color[ffff]}or one\nthat's stronger...\n\nAnd you might find yourself in need of\nbombs there. Make sure to carry\nseveral {color[0000]}Bomb Bags{color[ffff]}.
FTEL_50_04	The place you are traveling to...\n\n\n\nSomething large awakens? Hmm?{[0104|001e]}\nIt's huge... {[0104|0014]}Whatever it is, it's big!\n{[0104|0028]}It's bigger than huge!\n\nI'm seeing that you should take extra\n{color[0000]}Heart Potions{color[ffff]}. Oh, yesss... I foresee\nthat will help you succeed.
FTEL_50_05	I see the task that lies before you,\nyoung man... Oh yes, I see all...\n\n\nYou seek a place to lay down roots.\nBut these are the roots of no ordinary\ntree, are they? So where can this tree\ngrow deep and strong?\n{[0106|fccd]}I see...{[0106|00cd]}a temple! A temple where an\nold woman now lives. Yes, there you\nwill find the perfect place!
FTEL_50_06	Ahhhh, yesss... You are searching\nfor something. Allow me to gaze into\nyour future...\n\nI see...a propeller falling through a\nsea of clouds... It is discarded, left to\nthe elements...\n\nAhhh, I see a {color[0000]}mountain of fire{color[ffff]}...\nI see a temple on this burning\nmountain! What you seek is {color[0000]}just down\nthe mountain from this temple{color[ffff]}...\nA burning mountain... Could such a\nthing truly exist?
FTEL_50_07	Ahh... Structures with large, whirling\nsails come into focus. Something\ncreates a gust, and the structures...\nturn! The two buildings face...a tower!
FTEL_50_07_1	Let me see... You seek a certain\nsomething in order to repair a broken\nobject. Yesss...\n\nAh... I see an {color[0005]}Ancient Flower{color[ffff]}{[0106|fbcd]}...{[0106|00cd]}\n\n\n\nIn my visions, I have seen Ancient\nFlowers blossoming in ages past where\nthere is now {color[0000]}sand{color[ffff]}.{[0104|0014]} If you scour the\nsands, you will find one!
FTEL_50_08	Two whirling sails face a great tower,\nand atop that tower you play a tune.\nThen I see...light! A great light!\n\nThe light illuminates the path you\nmust follow!
FTEL_50_09	Young man, I see visions of the path\nthat lies before you. You will face a\ntrial! Yesss...deep within the shadows.\nA hair-raising test...\nGo to the woods! There you will find\nthe test that awaits you!
FTEL_50_09_1	Oh! I see that you've safely cleared the\ntrial in the woods. Yessss...you can hide\nnothing from these eyes!\n\nMy visions...they show me a{color[0000]} large tree\n{color[ffff]}in the middle of that forest. There is\nan important individual there.\n\nAnd a large stone statue...{[0104|0014]}yesss...\nUnderground...{[0104|0014]} Going up, going\ndown... Oh, yes, I see a flurry of\nactivity in your future.\nAnyway, just get yourself to the place\nwith many trees!
FTEL_50_27	My big, crystal-clear eyes...they see\na path before you! You must learn a\n{color[0000]}song {color[ffff]}within a holy sanctum!\n\nAnd what's this? My vision shows me\nit is a place you've visited before.\nA sacred place among the clouds...
FTEL_50_10	What's next for you? Let's see what\nwe can see... You will find {color[0000]}the entrance\nto a trial {color[ffff]}lying hidden in a sandy place!\n\nThat is all the vision shows. These\neyes, they have seen much. Your next\ndestination is a place awash in sand.
FTEL_50_10_1	Oho! You appear to have passed a\ngreat trial in a sandy place. No time\nfor congratulations—more visions\napproach!\nHmm... You must go to a place with\neven MORE sand. But I also see\n{color[0000]}an expanse of water{color[ffff]}...{[0104|0014]} And a {color[0000]}ship{color[ffff]}!{[0104|0014]}\nThis is all very confusing to behold...\nAnyway, you need to get to another\nsandy place!
FTEL_50_11	Sheesh! How many of these trials\nmust you undergo before your hunger\nfor challenge will be sated?!\n\nThis time I see...fire! You will find\n{color[0000]}the entrance to a trial{color[ffff]} lying hidden on\na fiery mountain!\n\nAnd of course you would not think to\ntake a {color[0000]}Wooden Shield{color[ffff]}, because that\nwould be foolish!
FTEL_50_14	Ahhh, I see you passed the trial of fire\nwith ease. But you have jumped from\nthe frying pan into...troubled water!\nOh dear... I mean, water troubles!\nOoooh, yess... I see that lack of water\nwill cause you much hardship. When\nthis happens, return and visit me\nonce more.
FTEL_50_15	Water, water nowhere...and so great\nthe need! Such a thirst to quench!\nThis is a vexing circumstance indeed. \n\nBut, young man, you have already\ndiscovered the basin needed in order\nto carry the water.\n\nYes, yes...it's all clear to me now.\nNever forget...these eyes see ALL!\nGo to the woods, for it is there that\nyou will find what you seek.
FTEL_50_28	I see a vision, yesss... I see you at a\nmountain of fire, guiding a basin of\nwater.\n\nAnd...ah, yes! Failure to deliver it will\nspell trouble for a certain someone!
FTEL_50_26	Aha! The task before you is as clear as\nmy unblinking eyes, young man!\n\n\nIt is also as hot as ever within the\nmountain of fire. To go there with\nan {color[0000]}Iron Shield{color[ffff]} would be most wise!
FTEL_50_12	Gulp... Again I see the shadow of a\ntowering monster...\n\n\nMy boy...no matter how many times I\npeer into your future, it never provides\na dull moment!\n\nOh, do forgive me... I didn't mean to\nimply your fate was entertaining, even\nif it is... Just take plenty of {color[0000]}potions{color[ffff]}.\nThe fortunes tell me you'll be fine!
FTEL_50_13	Young man, whatever have you done?\n\n\n\nIf my eyes do not betray me, then you\nare the one behind the disappearance\nof the Isle of the Goddess! Yess...\nNothing escapes my gaze.\nWell, worry not. I can see that you did\nnot make the isle disappear just for\nidle amusement!\n\nStill, I am afraid that it will be up to\nyou to find the proper path from here.\nTrust yourself!
FTEL_50_17	I see you've finally found the one\nyou've been searching for! That is\nwonderful news.\n\nHowever, your trials are not yet ended!\nNow you must speak to the great giant\nwho swims above the clouds.\n\nIf you wish to know more, you should\ntalk to the {color[0000]}headmaster of the Knight\nAcademy{color[ffff]}.
FTEL_50_16	Young man, you seek a song that has\nbeen divided into four parts, do you\nnot? Yes, yessss...I see all.\n\nThen there are one...two...{[0104|000a]}three\nregions that you must visit! And you\nmay go to them in the order of your\nchoosing!\nIn other words, go wherever you want,\nOK? You're bound to find something.
FTEL_50_29	Oh, there it is! Yesss, I see you have\ngathered three parts of the song you\nseek, and the fourth... It is held by\nsomeone very, very big!\nMake haste, for when you find this\nmassive creature, your song will be\ncomplete. I have foreseen it!
FTEL_50_18	You will use the song you obtained\nfrom the great swimmer above the\nclouds to discover {color[0000]}the location of the\nnext trial{color[ffff]}.\nMy vision shows me that this next trial\nawaits you {color[0000]}somewhere in this very town\nof Skyloft{color[ffff]}.\n\nStrange... I have no idea what that\neven means!
FTEL_50_22	So I see you have finally passed the\nfinal trial... Oh, yessss, all is revealed\nto my uncanny vision.\n\nI can see what you're after. You want\nto know what to do with the item you\ngot from the trial, don't you? \n\nSomewhere here in Skyloft is a {color[0000]}statue\nof an odd bird {color[ffff]}with {color[0000]}gem-like eyes{color[ffff]}.\nOh, but one of the gems is missing.\nSurely you've seen it before...\nAhem... If you place the item you have\nin the socket, your path will be clear!\nYessss...I see it all now...
FTEL_50_23	Ah, yesss... My vision reveals that you\nwill find what you seek on the Isle of\nthe Goddess.\n\nHowever, these great big eyes also see\nmuch peril. Your path will not be an\neasy one. Prepare yourself well!
FTEL_50_19	Also, if you happen to be looking for a\n{color[0000]}plant{color[ffff]} of some kind, then I also saw\na great green {color[0000]}forest{color[ffff]}. {[0106|fbcd]}Hmm... I can\nhardly imagine such a place...
FTEL_50_20	Also...you are searching for someone\nto plow a field for you, are you not?\n\n\nYou will find no such person in Skyloft!\nInstead, you must go to the {color[0000]}caves{color[ffff]} where\n{color[0000]}those who are skilled at digging{color[ffff]} dwell!\n\nThere you will find the right person for\nthe job. I have foreseen it!
FTEL_50_21	Ah! Yes, yes! I see it! You are searching\nfor something lost. A shiny, whirling\nthing...\n\nI see {color[0000]}a dry place with sand{color[ffff]}! You will\nfind it there in a place that is, itself,\nnot easy to find. These big, dewy\neyes...they do not lie!
FTEL_50_24	Oh! The mists are parting... I also see a\nperson who has lost a rare bug...\n\n\nMy crystal ball reveals that this bug \nis being held in secret on an island\nby {color[0000]}one with a love for insects{color[ffff]}!
FTEL_50_25	Ah, yesss... You have overcome a major\nobstacle and are understandably\npleased.\n\nYour next endeavor will be... {[0104|001e]}Ohhhh!\nThe {color[0000]}Ballad of the Goddess{color[ffff]}... {[0104|001e]}I see you\nwant to learn about it!\n\nSo who would be able to tell you about\nsuch a thing, you might wonder?\n\n\nGazing into my crystal ball, I see the...\n{color[0000]}headmaster of the Knight Academy{color[ffff]}!\nHe is the one to whom you should\nspeak, yesssss...
FAY_UR_01	I calculate a 60% probability that the\nobject you seek is in the woods.\nI advise you to search there.\n\n{[010b|00000004]}Do you want me to calibrate your\n{color[0000]}dowsing{color[ffff]} ability to search for the\n{color[0000]}Water Basin{color[ffff]}?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yep!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
FAY_UR_02	{[0112|00000005]}Yes, Master. Your {color[0000]}dowsing{color[ffff]} ability\nis now set to detect the {color[0000]}Water Basin{color[ffff]}.\nI suggest you begin searching at once.
FAY_UR_03	{[0112|00000005]}Yes, Master. I have canceled your\nrequest to set your dowsing ability.\nPlease talk to this person again when\nyou want to regain this dowsing target.

RMST_45	{[0109|000e0e0c]}Hey, kid! Looks like you're a bit\nshort on materials. You don't have\nenough {color[0005]}{[0201|00b0]}s{color[ffff]}.\n\nThey're very rare and extremely\nvaluable, or at least that's what it says\nhere in my grandpa's notes.

JUNK_00	{[0109|00000003]}Hey, kid! What's up? You look like you\nneed to get something off your chest...\n\n\nI think I know what it is. You've got a\nfavor to ask me, right?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes.{[0101|0000]}Not really.
JUNK_00_01	{[0109|00101008]}...Huh? {[0104|0028]}It's about this old robot my\ngrandpa used to tinker around with?\n\n\n{[0109|00000e00]}...You probably just came here to make\nfun of the crazy junk guy for believing\nin his grandpa's stupid stories, right?\n\nWell, get in line... I've heard it before.{[0104|0028]}\nWait... That's not why you're here?\nYou say you need to pick up something\nfrom below the clouds with this robot?\n{[0109|00070700]}Do you know what that means?!\nThat means...you believe in my\ngrandpa's stories too, don't you?!
JUNK_00_02a	{[0109|000d0900]}Well, I'm happy to hear that someone\nelse believes me, but I don't think I can\nhelp you. You see, my grandpa's old\nrobot... What's it called again...
JUNK_00_02b	Oh, hey, that's right... I remember!\nHis name is {color[0003]}Scrapper{color[ffff]}. He may not be\nmuch to look at these days...\n\nBut he was an amazing robot once!\nWhen you called him, he would go\nanywhere and haul anything!\n\nSadly, as you can see now{[0106|ffcd]}...{[0106|00cd]}he's just\nanother busted ol' hunk of junk...
JUNK_00_02c	{[0109|000d0e00]}But old Gramps did tell me this:\nyou can get him working again with the\nextract from an {color[0005]}Ancient Flower{color[ffff]}.\nIt's like oil to this guy.\n{[0109|000f0e00]}But I've never even heard of, much less\nseen, any such thing!\n{[0100|ffff]}Take mine!{[0101|0000]}Me neither.
JUNK_00_03	{[0109|00070717]}WHAT?! You have one?! Are you\nkiddin' me?! That's amazing!
JUNK_00_04	{[0109|000f0916]}Yeah, who has, right?\nBut if I just had one {color[0005]}Ancient Flower{color[ffff]}...
JUNK_01	{[0109|000e0e0c]}Hold it{[0106|fdcd]}... Why would you say you have\none when you really don't?! That's a\ndirty trick, kid.
JUNK_05	{[0109|00000001]}If you want me to get {color[0003]}Scrapper{color[ffff]} here\nworking again, I need one {color[0005]}Ancient\nFlower{color[ffff]}. But I dunno where they are.\n{[0100|ffff]}I have one!{[0101|0000]}Me neither.
JUNK_06	{[0109|00000018]}So this is an {color[0005]}Ancient Flower{color[ffff]}?!\nI can feel some slick, oily stuff coming\nout of its stem! Great, with this we can\nfix {color[0003]}Scrapper{color[ffff]}!\n{[0109|00070700]}...Wait right here! I'll have him up and\nrunning in no time!
JUNK_07	{[0109|0008110a]}WHOA! It talked! Can you believe\nthat? I guess I really did fix him!\n\n\nThis kid gave me the materials I\nneeded to fix you. Go on!\nSay thank you!
JUNK_08	{[0109|00090952]}Heyyyy now! Watch it! That's no way\nto talk to someone who just saved\nyour life!\n\n{[0109|00070700]}...Anyway, this kid wants you to haul\nsome stuff around, and you're going\nto help him!
JUNK_09	{[0109|00001104]}So...take good care of {color[0003]}Scrapper{color[ffff]}\nfor me, will you? By the way, he can\nsense people's thought waves or\nsomething...\n{[0109|00080700]}That means wherever you are, if you\nneed him, he'll be there in a jiffy!\n\n\nHe's got kind of a mean little mouth on\nhim, but if he's in a good mood, he'll\nwork hard for you!\n{[0104|001e]}Anyway, enough of my yappin'!
JUNK_10	{[0109|00070700]}So how 'bout another upgrade?\nI'll repair your shield too!\n{[0100|ffff]}Upgrade.{[0101|ffff]}Repair shield.{[0102|0000]}No, thanks.
JUNK_11	{[0112|00000065]}{[0109|0000000f]}Phew{[0106|fccd]}...{[0106|00cd]} There you go!{[0105|001e0000]}
JUNK_12	{[0109|00000003]}Hey, kid! How's {color[0003]}Scrapper{color[ffff]} treating\nyou? Anything to upgrade today?\n{[0100|ffff]}Upgrade.{[0101|ffff]}Repair shield.{[0102|0000]}No, thanks.
JUNK_13	{[0109|00070700]}So how do you plan to recover all the\nstuff that fell beneath the clouds?\n\n\nYou know, you could always ask the\n{color[0000]}fortune-teller {color[ffff]}over there...\n\n\nI know he's kind of goofy looking,\nbut when it comes to finding things,\nhe's always right on the money.

TOWN2_12	{[0109|000f0409]}You don't even have that many!\nQuit wasting my time.
TOWN2_38	{[0109|000f0409]}Listen, pal...I've had enough of the\nfunny business. You don't even have a\nsingle one of those. So do you want to\nsell something else or what?\n{[0100|ffff]}I'll sell!{[0101|0000]}No deal.
TOWN2_13	{[0109|0010080a]}All right. Here's your money.

TOWN2_17	{[0109|0000ff01]}Oh. It's you... {[0301]}{[0200]}.\nWhat do you want with me?
TOWN2_31	{color[0000]}{[0109|00000300]}{color[ffff]}Huh? What am I doing?\n\n\n\n{color[0000]}{[0109|00ff0114]}{color[ffff]}{color[0000]}Bugs{color[ffff]}... I'm looking at bugs.
TOWN2_29	{[0109|0001ff00]}Bugs are amazing. Even more\namazing than Groose in a lot of ways...\n\n\nOh...{[0104|001e]}wait. I'm not saying Groose isn't\nas amazing as a bug.
TOWN2_30	Look, {color[0000]}I just really like bugs{color[ffff]}... I want to\ncollect all kinds of bugs. Sometimes,\nI even dream about having, like, an\nentire island full of bugs...
TOWN2_18	{[0109|00ffff01]}...How about this!\n\n\n\n{[0301]}{[0200]}, here's the plan.\n{color[0000]}If you find a bug, come sell it to me{color[ffff]}.\nWhen it comes to bugs, Rupees are \nno object.\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure!{[0101|ffff]}Er...
TOWN2_19	{[0109|0003ff04]}Mwah hah hah! Now all my\nbug-collecting ambitions will finally\nbe realized...
TOWN2_20	{[0109|0001ff05]}What? I was sure you'd go for that...\nDon't make me sic Groose on you...
TOWN2_21	So if you ever want to sell any bugs,\njust bring them to me. I usually hang\nout here at night...\n\n{[0109|00120100]}I won't just buy any bug, though.\nWhat I buy on any given day just\ndepends on the {color[0000]}mood{color[ffff]} I'm in.\n\nOh, one other thing... This might bug\nyou a little bit, but I only want to\n{color[0000]}do these deals at night{color[ffff]}. I have a\nreputation to protect, you know.\n{[0109|0003ff14]}Got it, {[0200]}? I don't mean\nto be a pest, but I'm counting on you.\nI can't stop thinking about bugs...
TOWN2_24	...So let's get to it. Want to sell me\nsomething?
TOWN2_22	{[0109|00030001]}Oh, it's you, {[0200]}.\nI thought you might come by.\nLet's just say a little bug told me...
TOWN2_23	{[0109|00030001]}Hey, {[0200]}. Something's\nbugging me today. I mean that in a\ngood way...
TOWN2_36	{[0109|00030001]}{[0301]}{[0200]}... Want to hear\nsomething neat? OK, so...earlier in\nthe night, I went back into those\ncaves behind the waterfall.\nI saw some {color[0000]}Blessed Butterflies {color[ffff]}in this\nempty area. I wonder why they were\nswarming around that spot...\nWeird, right? \nIf you want to see them for yourself,\nyou should go into the caves at night.
TOWN2_39	Oh, right. Let's see what kind of bugs\nyou've got for me today.
TOWN2_62	Let's see... Tonight I feel like buying:\n{color[0005]}{[0202|00000000]}{color[ffff]}\n{color[0005]}{[0202|00000001]}{color[ffff]}\n{color[0005]}{[0202|00000002]}{color[ffff]}\n{[0100|ffff]}I'll sell!{[0101|0000]}No deal.
TOWN2_25	{[0109|0001ff13]}Well, that's too bad...\n{[0109|00000500]}I guess I'll “bee" seeing you...
TOWN2_64	Which do you want to sell me?\n{color[0005]}{[0100|ffff]}{[0202|00000000]}{color[ffff]}.{color[0005]}{[0101|ffff]}{[0202|00000001]}{color[ffff]}.{color[0005]}{[0102|ffff]}{[0202|00000002]}{color[ffff]}.

TOWN2_209	{color[0005]}{[0202|00000001]}{color[ffff]}, hmm?\nFor one of those, how many Rupees\nshould I part with? Hmmmm...\nHow about {[0203|0000000100cd]}?
TOWN2_210	{color[0005]}{[0202|00000002]}{color[ffff]}, hmm?\nFor one of those, how many Rupees\nshould I part with? Hmmmm...\nHow about {[0203|0000000200cd]}?
TOWN2_26	{[0109|0003ff04]}Thanks, mantis face!\n\n\n\nI mean that in a good way! I love\nmantises. Well, I'm looking forward\nto seeing more of your bugs,\n{[0200]}.
TOWN2_27	{[0109|0010ff0c]}You don't have even one of those!\nYou look like you wouldn't harm a fly,\nbut you're still trying to rip me off?\n\n{[0109|0001ff00]}Or do you just want to sell me a\ndifferent bug?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yep!{[0101|0000]}No deal.
TOWN2_28	How many have you got there—{[0203|0000000400cd]}?\nAnd how many of those are you looking\nto sell?\n{[0100|ffff]}1.{[0101|ffff]}5.{[0102|ffff]}All of them!{[0103|0000]}No deal.
TOWN2_42	{[0109|00120100]}You don't have that many... So I'll ask\nyou again...
TOWN2_43	{[0109|00030014]}I love a good {color[0005]}{[0202|00000000]}{color[ffff]}...\nAnd you're selling {[0203|0000000000cd]} of 'em, eh?\nHow many Rupees should I throw your\nway... I'm gonna say {[0203|0000000100cd]}.\n{[0100|ffff]}OK!{[0101|0000]}Never mind.
TOWN2_44	OK, here's your money.
TOWN2_49	{[0109|00000000]}Nnngghh snrrrk...\nSNNNNRRRKK...
TOWN2_50	{[0109|00000003]}Ahhh... This child just won't go to\nsleep for me... What can I do? Ahhh...\n{[0100|ffff]}That's terrible!{[0101|ffff]}And your wife?
TOWN2_50_01	{[0109|00000004]}Yeah, it is pretty terrible... But even\nwhen babies cry, they're still really\ncute... If they're yours, I guess.\n\nYou'll understand someday when\nyou've got one of your own!
TOWN2_50_02	{[0109|00000007]}Ah, the missus{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}. She gets tired from\nrunning the business all day.\n\n\n{[0109|000d0f06]}I have to let her get some rest\nsometime, right...? Ha ha...
TOWN2_51	{[0106|fccd]}...{[0104|002d]}{[0106|00cd]}{[0109|000d0000]}Sigh...{[0105|00410000]}
TOWN2_110	Ahhh... Doesn't look like I'll get much\nsleep tonight...again.\n{[0100|ffff]}Why?{[0101|ffff]}Are you tired?
TOWN2_52	{[0109|00100f06]}Sorry to worry you...
TOWN2_53	{[0109|00100f07]}Well, you can see what my nights are\nlike, right?
TOWN2_54	{[0109|000d0f00]}The baby just goes on and on like this\nall night. I haven't slept a wink in...\nAhhh... I don't even know how long.\n\nThe baby usually sleeps like a sack of\nrocks. But that was before we lost\nthe you know what...\n{[0100|ffff]}No, what?{[0101|ffff]}Oh, that?
TOWN2_55	{[0109|00100f01]}The baby's {color[0005]}{[0201|00a0]}{color[ffff]}.
TOWN2_56	{[0109|00100f04]}So you know about it? Yes, the baby's\n{color[0005]}{[0201|00a0]}{color[ffff]}.
TOWN2_57	{[0109|00000f00]}If we had the you know what, then\nthe baby would settle down. But we \nlost it the other day.\n\n{color[0000]}A bird picked it up {color[ffff]}in its beak and {color[0000]}flew\noff with it{color[ffff]}. Maybe the bird thought it\nwas food. I don't know...\n\n{[0109|000e0f00]}Of course, the bird wouldn't have \neaten it, so I think it must still be\n{color[0000]}somewhere here in town{color[ffff]}. I just don't\nknow where...\n{[0109|00000009]}Sigh... It sure would be nice if\nsomeone would find it for me.
TOWN2_58	{[0109|000d0f09]}Ahh...I hope someone finds the \nbaby's {color[0005]}{[0201|00a0]}{color[ffff]}...\n\n\n{[0109|00100000]}A {color[0000]}bird flew away with it{color[ffff]}. It must still\nbe {color[0000]}somewhere in town{color[ffff]}... {[0109|000d0000]}Sigh.\nIt looks like I won't get any sleep\ntonight, either...
TOWN2_59	{[0109|00000e0d]}Is that...? The baby's {color[0005]}{[0201|00a0]}{color[ffff]}!\nYou found it!
TOWN2_60	Who's a sleepy baby?\nTime for beddy-bye.{[0105|00780000]}
TOWN2_61	{[0109|00000e08]}Whew. The baby seems to have settled\ndown nicely. I bet the baby will sleep\nwell tonight. Oh! That means I'll\nfinally get a good night's sleep too!\n{[0109|00100e00]}Thank you so much! I won't forget\nwhat you did for me.
TOWN2_91	{[0109|00000e08]}Finally, I can sleep! Thank you!
TOWN2_63	{[0109|00000008]}Oh, thank you, thank you! I appreciate\neverything you've done.
TOWN2_66	{[0106|fccd]}5...6...7...
TOWN2_195	Nnghh... Snrrrk... Hrmmph...
TOWN2_193	{[0106|fecd]}55...56...57...
TOWN2_196	Snrrrrrk... Hrrmphh...
TOWN2_194	3,985...3,986...\n3,987...3,988...
TOWN2_197	Hrrrnnnnghhh...!
TOWN2_192	{[0109|00000010]}Whew... Let me catch my breath...\n\n\n\n{[0109|00101600]}Hey... {[0301]}{[0200]}! Oh!\nWhat am I doing? I'm training!\n\n\nI can't even lift a single barrel...\nPathetic, I know! That's why I want\nto get stronger.\n\nI'm a bit embarrassed about it, though,\nso I do it at night when no one's\naround to laugh at me...\n\n{[0109|00001711]}But it's not going so well. I'm just too\ntired. I was actually about ready to\nthrow in the towel...
TOWN2_212	Ahh...if only there were {color[0000]}a potion that\nwould give me stamina{color[ffff]}, then I could\ndrink that and maybe find that last\nlittle bit of strength I need...
TOWN2_214	{[0109|00000003]}...Fat chance, right? I suppose I'll have\nto just put my nose to the grindstone...\nYep, just buckle down my bootstraps\nand all that... Right?\nAnyway, I'll just keep working on this\nfor as long as I can! All on my own,\nI guess... Sigh...
TOWN2_215	{[0109|00000003]}Oh...but don't worry about me...\nI still have some get-up-and-go in\nme... I think... Maybe...
TOWN2_67	{[0109|00000011]}Whew...whoo... It's no good...\n\n\n\nIf only I had {color[0000]}a potion that would give\nme stamina{color[ffff]}, then maybe I could reach\ndown deep for that 110%...
TOWN2_68	{[0109|00000011]}I just...whoo...need a breather...\n{[0301]}{[0200]}, what have you got\nthere? Is that... a {color[0005]}Stamina Potion{color[ffff]}?\n\nI don't suppose you'd...let me have\nthat, would you?\n{[0100|ffff]}Take it!{[0101|0000]}Sorry...
TOWN2_213	{[0109|0000000b]}Oh! {[0301]}{[0200]}, what have you\ngot there? That's not... It's not a\n{color[0005]}Stamina Potion{color[ffff]}, is it?\n\nI don't suppose you would mind letting\nme have that, would you?\n{[0100|ffff]}Take it!{[0101|0000]}No way.
TOWN2_69	{[0109|00000011]}Oh... Of course... I don't mean to put\nyou out.
TOWN2_70	{[0109|0000000b]}Really?! Thank you! I owe you one!
TOWN2_71	{[0109|00000010]}Whoo-yeah! I can feel my muscles\nperking back up already!
TOWN2_103	{[0109|00000012]}It's just that...at this rate, I don't\nknow if I'll ever get strong and burly.\n{[0100|ffff]}Try your best!{[0101|ffff]}Yes, you can!
TOWN2_72	{[0109|00000009]}Right! That's exactly what I need to do.\nNo more whining! I need to push\nmyself.
TOWN2_73	{[0109|00001609]}Wow... Really? It's great to hear\nyou're so confident in me. Maybe I can\nactually do this...
TOWN2_74	{[0109|00001800]}Thank you, {[0200]}. \nI'll make you proud. You'll see! I'll be\nsuper burly in no time!\n\n{[0109|00151800]}OK, back to training! Come back soon\nso I can show you the new me!
TOWN2_75	{[0109|00071602]}I'll do my best! And someday I'll be\nstrong. Come back soon so I can show\nyou the new me!
TOWN2_76	{[0109|00000010]}Oh...whoo...I'm sweating up a storm.\nGood evening, {[0200]}!\n\n\n{[0109|0c10ff00]}I've been training hard ever since we\nlast spoke, but I still feel so sluggish...\nMaybe I've just run out of energy.
TOWN2_216	Hey, {[0200]}. Do you think\nyou could give me some more\n{color[0000]}Stamina Potion{color[ffff]}?
TOWN2_217	{[0109|00000003]}No, no... I can't keep asking you for\nfavors like that! I'll just keep working\nat it on my own.
TOWN2_218	{[0109|0000000b]}Ah! {[0301]}{[0200]}, is that...\nIs that a {color[0000]}Stamina Potion{color[ffff]} you're \ncarrying?\n\nWould you mind if I had some?\n{[0100|ffff]}Take some!{[0101|0000]}Sorry.
TOWN2_78	{[0109|00000010]}Whoo... I can't seem to catch my\nbreath...\n\n\nHey, {[0200]}, I wonder...\nWould you mind sharing some \n{color[0005]}Stamina Potion{color[ffff]} with me?\n{[0100|ffff]}Take some!{[0101|0000]}Sorry.
TOWN2_79	{[0109|00000011]}Of course, of course... Sorry, I was\nbeing foolish and presumptuous.
TOWN2_219	It's OK. I'll be fine! I'll just keep at it\non my own.
TOWN2_80	{[0109|0000000b]}Really? Wow, thanks! I'll gladly take\nit, then.
TOWN2_81	{[0109|00000010]}Whoo-hoo! That's the stuff! It's like a\nrefreshing splash of ENERGY!
TOWN2_190	{[0109|00000012]}...Sometimes I worry, though. All this\ntraining, and no results! How long do I\nneed to train before I start to get\nstronger?\nWhat do you think, {[0200]}?\nHow many push-ups do you think I\nneed to do to get strong?\n{[0100|ffff]}About 1,000!{[0101|ffff]}Not about numbers.
TOWN2_82	{[0109|00000053]}Ulp... That many? Really?\n\n\n\n{[0109|00100e00]}OK, then... I guess there really is no\ngain unless there is also pain. So much\npain...
TOWN2_83	{[0109|00000007]}It's not about numbers? ...Of course!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00070800]}You mean I should just keep at it until\nI've forgotten how many I've done,\nright?
TOWN2_84	{[0109|00011600]}I guess that makes sense. Now that I\nknow that, I'll definitely start getting\nstronger!\n\n{[0109|00001800]}Come back soon so you can see how\nI'm doing!
TOWN2_85	{[0109|00000002]}{[0301]}{[0200]}! You're going to be\nshocked by how strong I am!\nCome back and see me soon!
TOWN2_86	{[0109|0015190a]}Phew! Well, that was a nice warm-up!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00011600]}...Hey, {[0200]}! I was just\nhoping you'd come by. I wanted to ask\nyou something.\n\n{[0109|00071800]}The other day I tried lifting some\nbarrels, and I was able to do it with\none arm!\n\n{[0109|00001600]}Do you think that means I've got\nenough muscle? What do you think,\n{[0200]}? Do I look strong?\n{[0100|ffff]}Too strong!{[0101|ffff]}For sure.
TOWN2_88	{[0109|0000180b]}Really? Thanks! I'm so happy.
TOWN2_89	{[0109|00071809]}Huh? Aww, you're just saying that.\nBut it's still nice to hear it.
TOWN2_87	{[0109|00001600]}It's all thanks to you,\n{[0200]}.\n\n\n{[0109|00011900]}I would have gotten discouraged if\nyou hadn't come by to cheer me on.\nYou gave me motivation!\n\n{[0109|0007180b]}Thank you so much, {[0200]}!
TOWN2_90	{[0109|0015180a]}I could just keep going and going!\nNext, I'm going to train so hard that\nI can lift a barrel with one finger.
TOWN2_92	{[0109|0015180a]}Phew! Not a bad warm-up...
TOWN2_93	{[0109|000a0c12]}Ugh... I'm so worried...\nSo worried...\n{[0100|ffff]}What's wrong?{[0101|ffff]}Calm down.
TOWN2_94	{[0109|00000411]}Ahh, {[0200]}. \nYou really want to hear about all my\ntroubles? That's kind of you.
TOWN2_95	{[0109|000b0500]}CALM?! How could I be calm at a time\nlike this?! ...I'm sorry. I know I\nshouldn't be yelling at you.\nThat won't help.
TOWN2_96	{[0109|00000400]}So you see, a short while ago my {color[0000]}little\nsister {color[ffff]}went out for a quick flight, but\nshe hasn't come home yet.\n\nIt was getting late for her to still be\nout, so I went looking for her\neverywhere... But I couldn't find her.\n\n{[0109|000b0500]}I just hope nothing has happened.\n...I'm worried sick thinking about it.
TOWN2_106	{[0109|00000411]}Hey, {[0200]}, would you\nmind helping me look for her?
TOWN2_106_1	{[0109|000d0400]}She said she was curious about that\n{color[0003]}colorful island{color[ffff]} that appeared recently,\nso I suspect she's somewhere in the\n{color[0000]}south{color[ffff]}{color[0000]}{color[0000]}western {color[0000]}sky{color[ffff]}.
TOWN2_106_2	{[0109|00010400]}I'm counting on you,\n{[0200]}!
TOWN2_97	{[0109|000a0c12]}I'm so worried... I feel just...sick.\nWhat was she thinking?\n\n\nI always made her take a {color[0000]}bottle{color[ffff]}\nof potion with her...but today I\nforgot...
TOWN2_97_1	{[0109|000d0400]}My sister said she was curious about\nthat {color[0003]}colorful island{color[ffff]} that appeared\nrecently, so I suspect she's somewhere\nin the {color[0000]}south{color[ffff]}{color[0000]}{color[0000]}western {color[0000]}sky{color[ffff]}.
TOWN2_97_2	{[0109|00010400]}Would you please help us look for her,\n{[0200]}?
TOWN2_107	{[0109|000b050d]}What?! You found my sister?!\nHer bird's injured and can't fly?!\n\n\n{[0109|000a0c00]}That's terrible! In that case, take her\nthis as quick as you can!\n\n\n{color[0005]}{[0109|00000400]}{color[ffff]}These are {color[0005]}{[0201|0037]}{color[ffff]}. \nThey will heal the bird's injury.
TOWN2_143	{[0109|0000050d]}But, wait... You're carrying too much.\n{[0109|00000400]}Make some space in your pouch,\nand then come and talk to me.
TOWN2_198	{[0109|000b0404]}If she uses this, it will quickly heal\nthe bird. She should then be able to\nmake her own way home.\n{[0109|00000c00]}Take it to my sister!\n{[0109|00000400]}You can keep the {color[0000]}Empty Bottle {color[ffff]}once\nshe's had a chance to use the stuff\ninside.\n\nI'm counting on you, \n{[0200]}!
TOWN2_108	{[0109|000b0406]}Where did all the {color[0005]}{[0201|0037]}\n{color[ffff]}go? You haven't given them to her yet?\n\n\n{[0109|000a0400]}To get more {color[0005]}{[0201|0037]}{color[ffff]}, just\n{color[0000]}collect them from mushrooms{color[ffff]}. I'm\ncounting on you, {[0200]}.
TOWN2_144	{[0109|000b0409]}Great—you've made room in your\npouch. Well then, take these!\n\n\n{color[0005]}{[0109|000a0400]}{color[ffff]}They're{color[0005]} {[0201|0037]}{color[ffff]}.\nThey'll heal the bird's injury.
TOWN2_109	{[0109|000b0409]}What's the deal, {[0200]}?\nYou need to hurry up and take those\n{color[0005]}{[0201|0037]} {color[ffff]}to my sister!\n\n{[0109|000a0400]}I'm counting on you!
TOWN2_115	{[0109|000b0e09]}{[0301]}{[0200]}! My sister made\nit home safely! {[0109|000a0400]}Thank goodness... \nI was so worried about her.\n\n{[0109|000b0400]}Thanks so much for your help,\n{[0200]}!
TOWN2_115_01	{[0109|000b0e09]}{[0301]}{[0200]}! My sister is safe!\n\n\n\n{[0109|000a0400]}I'm so relieved! I was getting so\nworried there. All these worst-case\nscenarios kept popping into my head.\n\nWhat? You're the one who gave my\nsister the bird medicine?{[0104|0014]}\n\n\n{[0109|000b0400]}Thank you so much! I don't have much\nto give you to repay you, but please\ntake this with my gratitude!
TOWN2_115_02	{[0109|000b0a05]}Oh, that's a shame. I wanted to\ngive you this {color[0005]}Empty Bottle{color[ffff]}, but it looks\nlike your pouch is full and you're also\nout of room at the Item Check...\nBut I'll hang on to it for you. If you can\nget rid of something from your pouch\nor make some room at the Item Check,\ncome see me later and it's all yours.
TOWN2_115_03	{[0109|000b0400]}It may not look like much, but believe\nme, there's a dozen uses for a fine\nbottle like that. Thanks again!
TOWN2_117	{[0109|000b0e09]}Hey, {[0200]}, thanks for\ntaking care of my sister like that.\nI won't forget what you did.
TOWN2_117_01	{[0109|00000001]}Hey there, {[0200]}! I haven't\nseen Zelda around lately. Do you know\nwhat happened to her?
TOWN2_117_02	{[0109|00000001]}Hey there, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\n{[0109|000a0400]}What's that? Something about {color[0000]}two\n{color[ffff]}{color[0000]}sails{color[ffff]}?{[0104|001e]} Sorry, but I've got zero interest\nin silly riddles. Why don't you go ask\nthe town {color[0000]}fortune-teller{color[ffff]} for help?
TOWN2_117_03	{[0109|000a0405]}Hey! Did you see what's going on?!\nThe Light Tower is shooting a beam of\nlight off into the thunderhead.\n\nIt's almost like the tower is telling us\nto head into that big mass of\nthunderclouds...or something.
TOWN2_117_04	{[0109|00000001]}Hey there, {[0200]}! Have you\nseen those three troublemakers around\nhere recently? It's been a while since\nI've seen them hanging around.\nMaybe failing the test to get promoted\nto the senior class got them to finally \nbuckle down and study for once.
TOWN2_117_05	{[0109|00000001]}Hello, {[0200]}! Did I tell you\nI went to see that Fun Fun Island place\nmy sister was talking about?\n\nThe guy I met there was telling me how\nhe dropped his {color[0000]}party wheel {color[ffff]}below the\nclouds, whatever that is. He looked\npretty broken up about it.\nIf you ask me, he'd best get over it.\nEveryone knows that once something\nfalls below the clouds, it's long gone!
TOWN2_117_06	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}! Always in a\nhurry to get somewhere, aren't you?
TOWN2_204	{[0109|000a0405]}Doesn't it seem weird that all these\nbutterflies have been gathering here in\nthe plaza? There's nothing I can see\nthat would draw them here.
TOWN2_204_01	{[0109|00000001]}Were you up to something down in the\nplaza? All of a sudden the whole sky\ngot real dark.
TOWN2_204_02	{[0109|00000001]}Did you hear all that racket just now?\nIt sounded like the island was fixing to\nshake itself to bits. What was all that?
TOWN2_222	{[0109|000b0409]}The Isle of the Goddess has...\ndisappeared? I mean, how does\nthat even happen?!\n\n{[0109|000a0400]}This can't be good. Something bad is\nabout to happen. I know it. I mean,\nother than the island disappearing...
TOWN2_224	{[0109|000a0a00]}Hey, you have a classmate named\n{color[0003]}Strich{color[ffff]}, right?\n\n\nHe said he'd discovered some kind of\ninsect paradise {color[0000]}inside that big\nthunderhead{color[ffff]}. That guy really loves\nbugs, doesn't he?\n{[0109|000b0400]}I wonder what he intends to do\nwith this insect paradise...
TOWN2_226	{[0109|00010400]}That {color[0003]}Strich{color[ffff]} guy said he was getting\na bunch of insects together so he could\ncreate Bug Heaven on an island {color[0000]}inside\nthat thunderhead{color[ffff]}!
TOWN2_226_01	{[0109|00010400]}Just a while back I bumped into {color[0003]}Strich{color[ffff]},\nwho told me he'd found some {color[0000]}rare bug{color[ffff]}.\nThe guy headed for the thunderhead\nlooking happier than I'd ever seen him.\nLooks like he's setting himself up to\nbomb his exam again...
TOWN2_98	{[0109|0000050b]}Well! If it isn't {[0200]}!\nI'm so glad you're here. {[0109|00120200]}My bird\ngot injured while I was out for a\nquick flight, and now he can't fly.\n{[0109|00011500]}I somehow managed to make a\ncrash landing here, but now we can't\nget home!\n\n{[0109|00121500]}I can't go home until my bird's better.\n{color[0000]}I need medicine{color[ffff]} to get him healthy.\nOf course, it can't be human medicine.\nIt has to be {color[0000]}bird medicine{color[ffff]}.\nHey, {[0200]}, {[0109|00150200]}I really need\nyour help. Will you go get some bird\nmedicine for me?\n{[0100|ffff]}Of course!{[0101|ffff]}Sorry.
TOWN2_99	{[0109|000b0409]}Thank you! You're a real lifesaver.
TOWN2_100	{[0109|000c1513]}You...you monster!\n\n\n\n{[0109|000b0409]}...But you're just joking, right?\nYou must be...
TOWN2_101	{color[0000]}My older brother has some bird\nmedicine{color[ffff]}. Just go find him, and he'll\ngive you what I need.\n\nI bet he's probably pacing {color[0000]}around\nthe plaza in Skyloft{color[ffff]}, waiting for me\nto come home and being worried\nout of his mind.
TOWN2_211	{[0109|00090509]}So you have the medicine after all!\nWhy didn't you say so? Those\n{color[0005]}Mushroom Spores{color[ffff]} are just what I need!\n\nIf you could just give them to me,\nmy bird would be better in no time!\nDo you mind if I have them?\n{[0100|ffff]}Here you go.{[0101|0000]}No way.
TOWN2_231	{[0109|0000050b]}So you'll give me those Mushroom\nSpores you're carrying? If you could\njust give them to me, my bird would be\nbetter in no time!\n{[0100|ffff]}Here you go.{[0101|0000]}No way.
TOWN2_229	No? Oh... Well, I guess there's nothing\nelse I can do but ask you to find my\nbrother and tell him what's happened\nhere. Would you mind?
TOWN2_102	Huh? Really? You already spoke to\nhim? Well, that makes things easier.
TOWN2_104	I'll be waiting for you here with\nmy bird. Hurry back!
TOWN2_105	{color[0000]}{[0109|00000001]}My brother has some bird medicine{color[ffff]}.\nPlease go find him!\n\n\nI'll be waiting for you here with\nmy bird.
TOWN2_111	{[0109|0000000b]}...Oh, {color[0005]}{[0201|0037]}{color[ffff]}! What a relief!\nYou brought the medicine!\n{[0100|ffff]}Here, take it!{[0101|0000]}Sorry, no.
TOWN2_112	{[0109|00001113]}You...you monster!
TOWN2_113	{[0109|000b0409]}Thank you! Now I can heal my bird's\ninjury.
TOWN2_189	{[0109|00000004]}Now my poor bird should be healthy\nagain in no time!
TOWN2_116	{[0109|00000009]}I was beginning to think we were\ndoomed...\n\n\nYou've saved my life...and my bird's!\nWe both owe you a big thanks!
TOWN2_114	{[0109|00000004]}Here we go! See you back in town!
TOWN2_118	{[0109|0000000b]}Oh, {[0200]}. Thanks for all \nyour help!\n\n\n{[0109|00000400]}My bird is back to full health.\nThank you so much.

TOWN2_118_02	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}.\n\n\n\n{[0109|00110057]}{color[0000]}Two whirling sails{color[ffff]}, you say?\n\n\n\n{[0109|00010000]}You know, those blades on the\n{color[0000]}windmills {color[ffff]}look kind of like whirling\nsails, don't they? I wonder if that's it...
TOWN2_118_03	{[0109|00000013]}For a moment there, it looked like\nthe sky was shrouded in darkness.\nI wonder if something happened...
TOWN2_118_04	{[0109|00000057]}What?! The Triforce?!\nYeah, never heard of it...\n\n\nHave you tried asking the Knight\nAcademy headmaster about it?
TOWN2_118_05	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}.\n\n\n\n{[0109|000c0200]}So is it true you learned how to get\nyour Loftwing to pull off that\nlegendary Spiral Charge maneuver?{[0104|001e]}\n{[0109|000c050b]}That's amazing!
TOWN2_118_06	{[0109|00000013]}Wow, I've never felt the island shake\nlike it did. What could've happened?
TOWN2_223	{[0109|00000001]}The Isle of the Goddess has\nvanished, {[0200]}!\n\n\n{[0109|00001513]}And it was such a great resting spot\nfor the birds...
TOWN2_119	Ooooooooh...

TOWN2_203	{[0109|00000008]}Huh...? What's your problem? Why are\nyou looking at the restroom?
TOWN2_228	What? There's someone in the\nrestroom at night who wants...paper?
TOWN2_203a	{[0109|00001b1b]}You fool! How dare you! This is no\nordinary piece of paper! It's a {color[0000]}letter{color[ffff]}!\nA very special one at that!\n\n{[0109|00172500]}I put my heart into every word...\nI guess you could say it's sort of like a...\nAll right, fine! It's a love letter!\n\n{[0109|00171800]}And that is why you will not, under any\ncircumstances, EVER allow it to be\nused as toilet paper! Do you hear me?!
TOWN2_230	So listen up! The person you must give\nit to is a girl...

TOWN2_150_2	{[0109|00001001]}That outfit looks great on you!\n\n\n\n{[0109|0000040a]}Not as good as it looks on Pipit,\nthough!
TOWN2_151	{[0109|00000014]}Sigh... Oh, {color[0003]}Pipit{color[ffff]}... How can I get you to\nnotice me?
TOWN2_152	{[0109|00080404]}Ah! {[0301]}{[0200]}!\n\n\n\nUhh, what's the matter? Do you, uh...\nneed something?\n{[0108|fecd]}I wonder if he heard what I was just talking about...?{[0108|00cd]}\n{[0100|ffff]}Give the letter.{[0101|ffff]}Don't give it.
TOWN2_153	{[0109|00010406]}Huh? You're a strange one, aren't you,\n{[0200]}?
TOWN2_154	{[0109|00080906]}Huh? A letter? For me{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}?\nCould it be from {color[0003]}Pipit{color[ffff]}?!\n{[0100|ffff]}Here you go!{[0101|ffff]}Never mind.
TOWN2_155	{[0109|00080912]}What kind of a trick is that?\nStop messing around!
TOWN2_156	{[0109|000e090a]}Oh... Thank you. I'll just take that.
TOWN2_200	{[0109|00100400]}I wonder who it's from?!
TOWN2_157	{[0109|00100d00]}Whoa...{[0104|0014]} {[0106|fecd]}That's some really terrible\nhandwriting...{[0106|00cd]}\n\n\n{[0109|00100400]}Anyway, never mind that... Let's see\nwhat it says...
TOWN2_202	...“Greetings. My love for you is wider\nthan the horizon and deeper than the\nclouds."\n\n{[0109|00131200]}“I would very much like it if you would\ngo out with me.\nYour brave knight,\n{color[0003]}Cawlin{color[ffff]}"\n\n{[0109|00000500]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.\n\n\n\n{[0109|00010d00]}Wow... This {color[0003]}Cawlin {color[ffff]}guy... Isn't he one\nof {color[0003]}Groose{color[ffff]}'s flunkies?\n\n\n{[0109|000c0400]}And...this... This is a love letter from\nthat {color[0003]}Cawlin{color[ffff]} kid...right?\n\n\n{[0109|000b0712]}Hoo boy...
TOWN2_158	{[0109|00000009]}So, yeah... I have to say, he really put\nhis heart into it and everything...\n\n\nI don't know... Maybe I should consider\ngoing out with {color[0003]}Cawlin{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n{[0109|00080900]}...Hah! As if!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00010d14]}Sigh... I wonder what {color[0003]}Pipit{color[ffff]} would think\nif he knew about this...
TOWN2_159	{[0109|00000001]}Thank you for bringing me the letter,\n{[0200]}.\n\n\n{[0109|00010d14]}Sigh... I wonder what {color[0003]}Pipit{color[ffff]} would think\nif he knew about this...
TOWN2_206	{[0109|00080909]}Hee hee! Thanks, {[0200]}.\nBecause of you, I have an amazing new\nboyfriend!\n\nBut I feel kind of bad about {color[0003]}Cawlin{color[ffff]},\nyou know?
TOWN2_160	{[0109|00000001]}Well, if it isn't {[0200]}.\nYou know, you seem to be getting more\nhandsome by the day.\n\nThat knight's uniform really suits you.\nAnd you give off that “reliable guy"\nvibe too.
TOWN2_160_01	{[0109|00000006]}Huh, the Triforce?{[0104|001e]} What's that\nsupposed to mean?
TOWN2_160_02	{[0109|00080e06]}Whoa, you can already Spiral Charge?!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00080909]}Wow...that's cool, {[0200]}!\n{[0104|001e]}{[0109|000c0400]}I mean...{[0104|0014]}whatever. I'm sure Pipit can\ndo it, too!
TOWN2_160_03	{[0109|000c0456]}Did you hear all that noise outside a\nlittle while ago? I wonder what that\nwas all about...
TOWN2_161	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}! You made it!\nFinally in the senior class! That outfit\nsuits you.\n\n{[0109|00101100]}But now's hardly the time to celebrate,\nright? I can't believe Zelda has gone\nmissing.\n\n{[0109|000c1400]}You and Zelda are so close... I know\nyou must be worried sick!\n\n\n{[0109|00081400]}I don't know... I just have this feeling\nshe's alive and well somewhere!\nYou've got to believe that and wait\nfor her to come home.
TOWN2_161_01	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}! How are you?\nFeeling a bit better, I hope.\n\n\n{[0109|00091400]}I'm afraid I've got some problems too.\nBut, you know, I try to put on a brave\nface in front of other people.\n\n{[0109|00110400]}If you do that, the unhappiness rolls\noff like water on a Loftwing's back.\nI always try to keep that in mind.
TOWN2_161_02	{[0109|00000005]}Hey, {[0200]}! \nYou're looking pretty upbeat lately.\n\n\n{[0109|0000040b]}That's the spirit! {[0104|0014]}Zelda will be home\nbefore you even know it. Just keep on\nbelieving that while you wait for her\nto come back!
TOWN2_161_03	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}!\nHow are you doing?\n\n\n{[0109|000c1400]}Huh?! What's this about a Triforce\nhidden by the goddess?\n\n\n{[0109|00101100]}Uhhh, I really don't know anything\nabout that...\n\n\n{[0109|00081400]}If you want to know about that kind\nof stuff, then you should ask one of\nthe instructors.
TOWN2_161_04	{[0109|00001101]}Hey, {[0200]}. Listen to this...\nIt's a confidential piece of information\nthat hasn't been shared with anyone\nbut you.\n{[0109|000c0400]}So, I was flying around outside when\nall of a sudden this weird building\npopped out of the bottom half of the\nIsle of the Goddess!\n{[0109|00110e00]}Just what's going on here in Skyloft?!
TOWN2_161_05	{[0109|000c0401]}Can you believe it? The Isle of the\nGoddess fell right out of the sky!\n\n\n{[0104|001e]}It breaks my heart to see it missing\nfrom Skyloft...{[0109|00110e00]}but, you know, I think\nit was a message from the goddess,\ntelling us to make the most of our lives.
TOWN2_161_06	{[0109|000c040b]}{[0108|ffcd]}Besides, she's not the only goddess in my life...
TOWN2_162	{[0109|00000001]}What's up, {[0200]}?
TOWN2_191	{[0109|00010c09]}...Huh? {color[0003]}Karane{color[ffff]} got a love letter?\n\n\n\n{[0109|000f1100]}I-I see... That's interesting...\nWow...\n\n\n{[0109|000c0c54]}Erm... Wh-what do you think she\nintends to do...?\n{[0100|ffff]}Date him.{[0101|ffff]}Beats me.
TOWN2_163	{[0109|00110e53]}What?! Th-this is a big problem,\nisn't it?!
TOWN2_164	{[0109|000f1118]}So you don't know? Well... That's going\nto bother me until I find out...
TOWN2_165	{[0109|00110e09]}...Oh! I mean, uhh... It's not like\nthere's anything going on between\nme and {color[0003]}Karane{color[ffff]}, you know?\nWe're just friends...\nSo it's not my business who she goes\nout with. I don't have much to say\nabout it.\n\n{[0109|000c0c00]}But you know...I do have a duty to\nmake sure that everyone is living up\nto the high ideals of our knight school,\nright?\n{[0109|00080c00]}I mean, ideal love is unfettered and\npassionate. Anything less than that\ncan't really be called love at all, you\nknow what I mean? \n{[0109|000b0c00]}So I should just step in and make sure\nthat she's found a true love that\naspires to the highest ideals of our\nfine educational institution, right?\n{[0109|00110e00]}And what about me? I have the right to\nexperience an unfettered and\npassionate love too, don't I?\n\n{[0109|000c0c1b]}You understand, don't you,\n{[0200]}? I'm not wrong\nabout this, am I?\n{[0100|ffff]}I don't know.{[0101|ffff]}You like her?
TOWN2_165_1	{[0109|00110e53]}Wha-what?! Don't be ridiculous,\n{[0200]}!\n\n\n{[0109|00120c00]}I don't even understand how you could\nmake such a wild accusation!
TOWN2_165_2	{[0109|000f1152]}I see... Of course. You've got more\nimportant things to worry about\nthan this right now!
TOWN2_165_3	{[0109|00101117]}Well, either way...\n\n\n\n{[0109|000f0c00]}I don't suppose you'd mind asking her\nwhat her decision is going to be,\nwould you?
TOWN2_166	{[0109|00000018]}Erm... Hmm...\n\n\n\n{[0109|000f1100]}Let's just say you had an interest \nin how that relationship turned out.\nDo you think it would be best to go \nand ask her about it?\n{[0109|00110e00]}I mean... That isn't to say that I have\na personal interest here, though.\nI'm just interested in the emotion\nof love...in general...
TOWN2_167	{[0109|000c0401]}Hey, {[0200]}! Thanks to you, \nI found a wonderful girlfriend!\nThank you so much!
TOWN2_168	You're the one who sent the letter,\nright?
TOWN2_169	Y-yes...
TOWN2_170	{[0109|14000009]}Tee hee. It was a wonderful love letter.\nThank you!
TOWN2_171	{[0109|05000011]}It wasn't...that...great...
TOWN2_207	And, um... Wh-what's your...answer?
TOWN2_172	{[0109|14000012]}My answer? Ah...my answer...
TOWN2_173	{[0109|05002519]}Oh, please! Please go out...with me!
TOWN2_174	Wait!
TOWN2_175	I think you should go out with me\ninstead! I mean...er...I want to ask\nyou out!
TOWN2_176	{[0109|05001b09]}What...? Hey, hold on there!\nWhat are you trying to pull all\nof a sudden?
TOWN2_177	Errr...{[0109|14000900]}\nI want to go out with... Pipit...
TOWN2_199	{[0109|05150c10]}Ha! See that, you fool?! I knew she\nwould choose me! She's been checking\nme out for weeks! Uhh, wait a second...
TOWN2_178	{[0109|05111d1d]}Wait... Really?!
TOWN2_179	{[0109|1201ff00]}Truly? You choose me?
TOWN2_180	Yes! {[0109|14000900]}I'm so happy. Thank you...
TOWN2_182	{[0109|05001d17]}This can't be happening...
TOWN2_183	{[0109|05000018]}Aaaaaghhhh!!!
TOWN2_184	{[0109|12000001]}{[0301]}{[0200]}!
TOWN2_185	When you told me about the letter,\nit was at that moment I finally\nrealized. I realized that...I love her.\n\n{[0109|12090c00]}I thought to myself, “I can't let anyone\nelse take her from me!"\n\n\n{[0109|12010400]}If you hadn't told me, I might\nnever have even noticed my own\nfeelings for her.\n\n{[0109|1208000b]}I'm so grateful. I don't know how I can\never thank you!

INS_01_01	{[0109|00000001]}{[0301]}{[0200]}? I wasn't expecting\nto see you here.\n\n\n{[0109|00120600]}I flew into this thick fog and ended up\non this island.\n\n\n{[0109|00000100]}But once I got here, I looked around\nand realized...this is some kind of\ninsect paradise!\n\n{[0109|00030104]}So I decided to go after my dream and\nraise a bunch of bugs here. Now I can\nspend my days catching all the bugs\nI want!\n{[0109|00000100]}You want to try catching some bugs?\nI'll release a few for you, so why don't\nyou give it a shot?
INS_01_01b	{[0109|00000100]}I have come up with two levels for my\nbug-catching competition: an easy\n{color[0000]}Bug Beginner {color[ffff]}level and a {color[0000]}Bug Wrangler\n{color[ffff]}level for real bug masters like me.\n{[0109|00030100]}Since you aren't a bug lover, I'll\ncharge you {color[0000]}20 Rupees {color[ffff]}for the Bug\nBeginner level and {color[0000]}50 {color[ffff]}for the Bug\nWrangler level. Do you want in on this?\n{[0100|ffff]}Bug Beginner!{[0101|ffff]}Bug Wrangler!{[0102|0000]}No, thanks.
INS_01_01c	{[0109|0013080a]}WHAT?! You don't even have a\n{color[0000]}Bug Net{color[ffff]}?! I don't believe this.\n\n\n{[0109|00000500]}You've never experienced the passion,\nthrill, and joy of bug hunting? I feel\nsorry for you.\n\n{[0109|00030100]}You can buy a Bug Net at {color[0000]}Beedle's\nAirshop{color[ffff]}, so do yourself a favor and go\nthere right now and get one!
INS_01_02	{[0109|00120513]}Well, I guess that means you never\nwere a real bug lover.
INS_01_03	{[0109|00000001]}You ready to start catching some\nbugs? Maybe you'll get bitten by the\nbug-catching fever, just like me.\nOr maybe you'll just get bitten...\nAnyway, it's {color[0000]}20 Rupees {color[ffff]}for the Bug\nBeginner level or {color[0000]}50 {color[ffff]}for the Bug\nWrangler level. What do you say?\n{[0100|ffff]}Bug Beginner!{[0101|ffff]}Bug Wrangler!{[0102|0000]}No, thanks.
INS_01_04	{[0109|00120315]}Looks like you don't have enough\nmoney. So what if we went to the\nKnight Academy together? I'm not\ncutting you any deals.
INS_01_05	{[0109|00120813]}Think you can go bug catching with\nso few {color[0000]}hearts{color[ffff]}? You're not taking this\nseriously. It's not looking good for you.\n\n{[0109|00000100]}Come back once you get some\nmore hearts.
INS_01_06	{[0109|00030100]}I'm going to be timing you while you're\nin the course. If you get a decent time,\nI'll give you a prize!\n\n{[0109|00000100]}In the Bug Beginner course, I will show\nyou pictures of five different bugs.\nCatch one of each to finish! Got it?\nOK, get ready!
INS_01_07	{[0109|00030100]}I'm going to be timing you while you're\nin the course. If you get a decent time,\nI'll give you a prize!\n\n{[0109|00000100]}In the Bug Wrangler course, you will\nneed to catch a total of 10 bugs that\nI specify from among eight different\ntypes. Got all that? OK, get ready!
INS_01_09	{[0109|00000005]}Hey! You're not thinking about quitting\nthis round of bug catching, are you?\n{[0100|ffff]}I quit!{[0101|0000]}Continue.
INS_01_10	{[0109|00120500]}So you really are quitting... I guess you\ndon't appreciate bugs like I do.
INS_01_11	I know, right? Time flies when you're\ncatching bugs!
INS_01_12	{[0109|00120500]}Uhh...don't you think you're taking\ntoo long?\n\n\n{[0109|00000100]}I know you're not done yet, but I'm\ncalling it. Time's up!
INS_01_13	{[0109|00131000]}Easy now! You were about to make a\nbeeline for a quick death there!\n\n\n{[0109|00030100]}Don't forget that bugs can fight back!\nI knew you were in over your head\nthere, so I had to stop the game.
INS_01_14	{[0109|00130807]}Hold on! Just hold it. You still don't\nhave a {color[0005]}Bug Net{color[ffff]}! Why am I wasting my\ntime with you?\n\n{[0109|00040100]}Come back when you finally get around\nto buying one!
INS_02_01	{[0109|00120107]}That's it—time's up! Umm...you've still\ngot A LOT of improving to do.\n\n\n{[0109|00000100]}For starters, shoot for getting your\ntime {color[0000]}under five minutes{color[ffff]}. Just keep on\npracticing.\n\n{[0109|00030100]}Oh, at night, I buy bugs back in my\nroom in Skyloft. You should come by\nand sell me any beauties you find.
INS_02_02	{[0109|00120104]}Time's up! That was pretty decent,\nI have to admit.\n\n\n{[0109|00000100]}Your times will get even better if you\nremember where the bugs live. Next\ntime, shoot for {color[0000]}under three minutes{color[ffff]}.
INS_02_02a	{[0109|00030100]}All right, here's some money. You\nget {color[0000]}80 Rupees{color[ffff]}!
INS_02_03	{[0109|00000811]}OK! Time! Hey... This is incredible!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00000100]}I think you might be in the running for\nsecond place as the best bug catcher\nafter me. You should aim for {color[0000]}under two\nminutes{color[ffff]}.\nDo that, and a prize package of {color[0000]}five\nfabulous bugs{color[ffff]} is yours to take home!
INS_02_04	{[0109|00130811]}OK, time's up! ...Th-this is amazing!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00000100]}I don't have any choice. I'm forced to\nadmit you're one of the all-time greats\nof bug catching! I bow down to your\nbug-wrangling skills.\n{[0109|00040100]}Let me give you your prize! You get\na set of insects... {color[0000]}Five{color[ffff]} rare ones at that!
INS_02_05	{[0109|00120500]}It's pretty sad that you can't see just\nhow fun catching bugs can be.\n\n\n{[0109|00000100]}But come back when you change\nyour mind!
INS_02_06	{[0109|00030100]}Sorry, I don't do refunds!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00000100]}Better luck next time. Heh heh heh.
INS_02_10	{[0109|00000004]}Heh heh heh... Who would have thought\nyou'd get so into bug catching that\nyou'd put your own life at risk?!\n\n{[0109|00000500]}Sorry, I don't do refunds! Come back\nlater when you have more hearts.
INS_02_07	{[0109|00000004]}OK, you're done! Huh. I guess I\nshould've expected this kind of time\nfrom you.\n\n{[0109|00000100]}You know, sometimes the same type of\nbug is a lot easier to catch in just a\ndifferent place. Make sure you look\naround for the right spot.
INS_02_07a	{[0109|00030100]}Next time, try for {color[0000]}under three minutes{color[ffff]}.\nOh, and I guess I should throw you\na little money. Here's {color[0000]}30 Rupees{color[ffff]}.
INS_02_08	{[0109|00000011]}That's it—time's up! Whoa...\nI'm impressed. You might just be a\nnatural at this!\n\n{[0109|00120500]}Don't get full of yourself, though.\nYou're still not good enough to win\nany of my rare insects.
INS_02_11	Next time, pull out all the stops and\ntry to finish in {color[0000]}less than two minutes{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nOh, and your prize this time is \n{color[0000]}50 Rupees{color[ffff]}!
INS_02_09	{[0109|00030811]}Stop! Stop! Time's up! That was just... \nincredible!\n\n\n{[0109|00120100]}Oh, but let me just remind you that you\nwere doing the Bug Beginner level\nof difficulty.\n\n{[0109|00000100]}Next time, try Bug Wrangler! As a\nprize, here are {color[0000]}five{color[ffff]} of my absolute\nfavorite {color[0000]}bugs{color[ffff]}!
INS_02_12	{[0109|00ffff00]}Take good care of them for me...
SUB_E00	{[0109|00000004]}Heh heh heh heh. Well well, it's\n{[0200]}! How's life?\n\n\n{[0109|00000100]}Oh, you think I look happy? Heh heh...\nWell, I guess I can't help it.\n\n\nI mean, I did discover an insanely rare\ninsect, after all.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me!{[0101|ffff]}Who cares?
SUB_E01	{[0109|00030100]}You want to know more, huh?\n\n\n\nWell...{[0104|001e]} {[0109|00130100]}Let's just say I managed to land\na legendary {color[0003]}Horned Colossus Beetle{color[ffff]}.{color[0003]}\n\n\n{color[ffff]}{[0109|00030100]}It's pretty much a miracle that I found\nit! I can't stop laughing or smiling.\nI'm so happy, my face hurts!
SUB_E03	{[0109|00010800]}What?! You're saying this is Beedle's\npet bug?! The same Beedle who flies\naround in that shack selling his junk?\n{[0100|ffff]}Give it back!{[0101|ffff]}Poor Beedle...
SUB_E01_01	{[0109|00120515]}I see... You really are a snake\nin the grass...
SUB_E01_02	{[0109|00100800]}So you really think a sob story like\nthat is going to work on me?\nWhat a joke.\n\n{[0109|00130100]}I found this bug, and it's all mine!

PUMP_02_02	{[0109|00070700]}The trick to carrying several pumpkins\nat once is {color[0000]}to walk slowly{color[ffff]}!\n\n\nIf they start to lean right, move right. \nIf they start to lean left, move left. \nTake your time, and keep your balance!\n\n{[0109|00010700]}But if you panic and start to rush,\nwell, you're going to drop them.\n{[0104|0014]}So...

BAR_10_01	{[0109|00000007]}What's that? You don't have any\n{[0201|00c3]}?!\n\n\n{[0109|000d0a00]}Don't tell me that you drank it!\nAnyhow, guess I'll just have to fill\nthat bottle up again.
BAR_25	But you'll have to pay me for it!\nThat'll be {color[0000]}10 rupees{color[ffff]}!
BAR_26	{[0109|0000000d]}What?! You don't have 10 Rupees?!\nWell...what can I do? You're off the\nhook...but just this once!
BAR_11	Hey! You haven't got an {[0201|0099]}!\n\n\n\nYou need an {[0201|0099]} if you want\nto carry soup! Go get yourself one and\ncome back here.
BAR_11_1	{[0109|00000001]}Oh, I see you brought an {[0201|0099]}\nwith you like I asked. Great!
BAR_27	{[0109|00000008]}Hey! Did you not hear a thing I said?\nYou let the soup get cold!\n\n\nI can't believe this... I'll fill it up again.
BAR_19	{[0109|00000700]}You don't have an {[0201|0099]}?!\n\n\n\nIt's mighty hard to drink soup when\nyou've got nothing to drink from!\nCome see me again when you've found\nan {[0201|0099]}!
BAR_21	It's about time! Take this!
BAR_23	The soup is meant to be enjoyed hot!\nJust so you know, it'll be cold in just\nfive minutes.
BAR_12	{[0109|00000011]}Why do I waste my time... Don't you\nfeel even a little bad about what\nyou did?
BAR_14	Go on out and talk with Kina. I need\nyou to help her with the pumpkin\nharvest!
BAR_15	{[0109|00080704]}This should be an easy one for you.\nKina spends her afternoons picking\npumpkins in the patch out back.\n\nCarry those to the storage shed.\n{color[0003]}Kina{color[ffff]} can give you the details!
BAR_22	Oh, but...you can only work on the\npatch during the day!\n\n\nThere's no telling what will happen\nunder the night sky!
BAR_17	{[0109|0000000e]}Ugh... I'll explain one more time.
BAR_18	{[0109|0000100e]}Great! That's what I want to hear!\n\n\n\n{[0109|000d0a00]}But make sure you put your heart into\nit! I won't stand for anything but\nyour best.
BAR_18_2	{[0109|00000700]}Customers will start waving their arms\nas Kina sings her song, so you can just\nfollow them if you need a guide to the\nrhythm you should be playing.\n{[0109|000f0700]}Pick a customer whose movements are\neasy for you to follow, and strum with\nthem to stay on the right tempo.\n\nDon't worry about the direction of your\nstrumming. Just make sure you're not\nplaying too fast or too slow, and use\nnice, big, sweeping motions to strum!\n{[0109|00080700]}When the customers stop moving,\nit's your chance to freestyle a little bit\nand play however you like!\n\nIt's all about playing to the rhythm!\nGot it?\n{[0100|ffff]}OK!{[0101|0000]}Huh?
BAR_28	{[0109|000d0002]}All right then! Hey! Kina!
BAR_29	{[0109|1a000008]}Yes, Father! What is it?
BAR_30	{[0109|000b0b00]}This kid is going to accompany you\nwhile you sing! Now how about letting\nyour Pops hear that beautiful voice of\nyours, eh?!
BAR_31	Of course! Let's do it, kid.
BAR_32	What's wrong? Did you not understand \nwhat I said? Listen up!
BAR_33	{[0109|00000001]}Hey! So you're saying that you'll \nplay one more time for Kina?\n{[0100|ffff]}I'm in!{[0101|ffff]}Explain!{[0102|0000]}No way.
BAR_34	{[0109|00000004]}Fair enough. Rest up and come back\nwhen you're ready to play!
BAR_35	{[0109|0000000e]}Great! I was hoping you'd say that.
PUMP_IN_01	{[0109|00000001]}Well, well... Welcome! I can see from\nyour handsome outfit there that you're\na Skyloft knight!\n\n{[0109|001a0800]}I hope you'll make yourself at home!\n\n\n\n{[0109|000d0700]}Have the Rupees sitting on top of\nthe chandelier caught your eye?\n\n\n{[0109|00100000]}Don't go thinking that you can get\nthose down, you hear?\n\n\nYou might think that you could knock\nthe Rupees down by bumping\nsomething and making the chandelier\nshake, but...\n{[0109|001a1600]}Don't even{[0106|fccd]} think{[0106|00cd]} about it!\nAre we clear?
PUMP_IN_01a	{[0109|00000001]}Well, well... Welcome!\n\n\n\nMy father told me! He said that you\nhave to work to pay off the chandelier!\n\n\n{[0109|001a0800]}It won't be easy, but I know you can\ndo it.
PUMP_IN_02	{[0109|00101604]}Don't even pretend that was an\naccident! I put signs up there to\nwarn people to be careful of the\nchandelier and everything!\n{[0109|001a1600]}Well I wash my hands of the whole\nthing! Don't be surprised if my dad\ngives you a royal chewing out!
PUMP_IN_03	{[0109|00000001]}Hey there!\n\n\n\nWelcome to the Lumpy Pumpkin!\nSit back and relax! {[0104|001e]}Are you OK?\nYou look flustered.
PUMP_IN_04	{[0109|001a1000]}What?! Something happened to\nLevias? \n\n\nYou know, Father used to deliver his\npumpkin soup to Levias every year.\nMaybe you should talk to him?
NPCA_01	{[0109|00000001]}Listen to this!\n\n\n\nThe old guy over there says he saw a\ndemon!\n\n\n{[0109|000a0300]}He's obviously trying to get Kina's\nattention, but he won't get anywhere\nusing creepy lines like that!
NPCA_02	{[0109|00111104]}Don't tell me you believe in\nsuperstitious hogwash like\ndemons now, do you?\n\n{[0109|000a0300]}Hold on! Are you trying to get Kina\nto look your way too?!
NPCA_03	{[0109|00111153]}Oh no. You've done it now!\nThere's no escaping this one!
NPCA_05	{[0109|00000001]}So all that talk about monsters and\ndemons was just superstition, right?!\n\n\n{[0109|00000300]}That old guy was just talking nonsense!
NPCA_04	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, did you know this?\n\n\n\n{color[0003]}Kina{color[ffff]} will sometimes get on that stage\nand sing a song or two for us.\n\n\n{[0109|00090700]}If there was a lovely melody playing,\nI bet she couldn't help but sing along.
NPCA_06	{[0109|00000001]}Hooo boy! It's been too long since I \nheard Kina sing like that. I might have\nfallen in love with her all over again!
NPCA_07	{[0109|00000001]}I hear this chandelier is here 'cause of\nall your hard work.\n\n\n{[0109|00000300]}You aren't just doing it to try and\nimpress Kina, are you?
NPCB_01	{[0109|00000001]}You believe me, don't ya?!\n{[0100|ffff]}Believe what?{[0101|ffff]}Sure!{[0102|0000]}No chance.
NPCB_02	{[0109|000b0703]}There's a fiendish demon living in\nSkyloft!\n\n\nI'm tellin' ya, I came this close to\ngetting eaten by that evil beast!\n\n\n{[0109|000b0700]}You look like you've gotten a little\nknight training, but you'd better keep\nyour guard up, or he'll take a bite out\nof you too!
NPCB_03	{[0109|000b0e04]}I know, right?! You're a good kid!
NPCB_04	{[0109|000a0f03]}Hey, now.{[0104|0014]}.{[0104|0014]}.{[0104|0014]} What's with you kids today\nand all your disrespectin' and whatnot!\nI swear...
NPCB_05	{[0109|000b0704]}You have that gullible look that says\nyou might take an old man's ramblings\nseriously. So tell me... Do you believe\nin the Skyloft monster?\nI shouldn't even call it a monster!\nIt's a demon, I tell ya! But no one\ncan say fer sure because no one's\nseen it and lived to tell the tale!\n{[0109|000b0700]}Wha-huh? You wanna know how\ncome I'm tellin' the tale if nobody\nwho's seen it is left alive? Is that it?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yep.{[0101|0000]}Not at all!
NPCB_09	{[0109|000b0704]}Well, you see... It was the dead of\nnight. I hit the {color[0000]}gravestone closest to\nthe tree{color[ffff]}. The {color[0000]}impact {color[ffff]}made the\ngravestone light right up!\nAfter that, I went to inspect the lit-up\ngravestone. When I {color[0000]}pushed against the\ngravestone{color[ffff]}, the door to the storage\nshed next to it opened all on its own...\nAnd that's when I saw it! I saw the\nmonster! It lives in the storage shed!\n\n\n{[0109|000a0f00]}I'm serious! You shouldn't go in\nthere! If you do, don't say I didn't\nwarn ya!
NPCB_15	{[0109|00000001]}What?! Didn't you hear me the first\ntime?\n\n\n{[0100|ffff]}Nighttime?{[0101|ffff]}Cemetery?
NPCB_16	{[0109|000b0704]}Yeah. If you want to wait till {color[0000]}night{color[ffff]},\nreturn to Skyloft and {color[0004]}rest in a bed{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nSkyloft becomes a completely different\nplace at night...\n\n\n{[0109|000a0f00]}I don't think you should go, though. \nAnd it's not my fault if something bad\nhappens to ya. Nope.
NPCB_06	{[0109|000a0f00]}Yeah, well...I saw it, but I was able to\nescape by the seat of my pants. I was\nsaved by my catlike reflexes, I tell ya!\n\n{[0109|000b0700]}Any regular person wouldn't have\nlived long enough to scream!
NPCB_07	Well I will keep going if you stop\ninterrupting me like that!
NPCB_08	{[0109|000b0700]}Anyway, I saw the thing, I tell ya!\n\n\n\nThere's a great big tree in the\ncemetery. I walked by that tree in the\n{color[0000]}middle of the night {color[ffff]}and...\n\nI saw it {color[0000]}hit{color[ffff]} the {color[0000]}gravestone nearest the\ntree{color[ffff]}, and the gravestone lit up!\n\n\nIt {color[0000]}pushed the gravestone{color[ffff]}, and the door\nto the storage shed opened up all by\nitself...\n\nThe monster then went into the shed,\nand then...it closed the door behind\nitself, which was unexpectedly polite\nfor a demon...\n{[0109|000b0700]}It was the most terrifying thing these\nold eyes have ever seen! If you're\nsmart, you'll stay clear of the {color[0000]}cemetery\nin the middle of the night{color[ffff]}!
NPCB_10	{[0109|000b0c04]}What?! Are you telling me you moved \nthe gravestone?!\n\n\n{[0109|000a0f00]}And did you see the monster?!\nWhat?! Weren't you scared?\n\n\nYou can't fool me! I bet you were\nscared stiff!
NPCB_11	{[0109|00000004]}You really shouldn't wander around \nSkyloft at night! If there's something\nyou want to talk to me about, do it\nduring the day.
NPCB_12	{[0109|000b0704]}What were you thinking? You scared\na year off my life!\n\n\n{[0109|000a0700]}What did you want again? I lost my\ntrain of thought...
NPCB_13	{[0109|00000004]}Kina's singing voice is beautiful!\n{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.But her music partner quit recently,\nand so I haven't heard her sing in a\nwhile.\nI really wish I could hear her voice\nagain.
NPCB_14	{[0109|00000004]}Yep! Kina's singing is the best I've\never heard! There's nothing like it.\nIt's the opposite of my wife's warbly\nvoice...
NPCB_17	{[0109|00000004]}It's nice having a bigger chandelier\nand all, but I think the thing's a bit\ntoo bright for my eyes.
P_A_00	{[0109|00070701]}Hey, so I guess he's going to be helping\nwith the pumpkin patch!
P_A_00_01	{[0109|00000001]}I don't understand that Kina. If she\nwas having trouble tending to the\npumpkin patch on her own, she could\nhave just asked me for help!
P_A_01	{[0109|1b090702]}Seriously! I could plow the patch\nmuch faster than that mole guy out\nthere!
P_A_02	{[0109|00000008]}What? Seriously? I'm so happy!
P_A_03	{[0109|1b070705]}Hahaha! For Kina, I'd do anything!\nWhether that's on a pumpkin patch\nor inside a burning house!
P_A_04	{[0109|1a000009]}Hehe! Well then I look forward to\ngetting your help out there!
P_A_05	You're all so sweet!{[0109|00070703]}
P_A_06	{[0109|1a000003]}Oh, but that's asking too much.\nCustomers shouldn't be made to\nwork in the pumpkin patch!
P_A_07	{[0109|00000002]}It's fine! I'll be a lot more reliable and\nhardworking than that shady-looking\nmole man you got here now!
P_A_08	{[0109|00090705]}Hah! I'm happy to do it. After all,\nI live to see that smile!
SAL_00	I brought the old Mogma, zzzrt!
SAL_01	Send my best to Fi, bzzzzzzat!
BAR_NUSHI_01	{[0109|00000001]}What's the matter? You look like\nyou've got something mighty\nserious on your mind.\n{[0100|ffff]}Actually...{[0101|0000]}Really?
BAR_NUSHI_01_01	{[0109|00000005]}Oh! I guess it was nothing, then.\nIf that's the case, why don't you kick up\nyour boots and stay awhile?
BAR_NUSHI_01_02	{[0109|00000004]}If that's the case, how about doing\nsome more work to pay off that\nchandelier?
BAR_NUSHI_01_03	{[0109|00000001]}Welcome to the Lumpy Pumpkin!\nThis here's every bird rider's favorite\nrest stop.\n\nOf course, this is the only place you can\ndrink our famous homemade pumpkin\nsoup!\n\nJudging from the look on your face,\nI'd say you've got something stewing\nin your mind.\n{[0100|ffff]}Actually...{[0101|0000]}Really?
BAR_NUSHI_02	{[0109|000d0d04]}{color[0003]}Levias{color[ffff]}{[0106|fbcd]}...{[0106|00cd]} What about him?\n\n\n\n{[0109|00000700]}Sure, I know Levias well, but I wasn't\naware anything was wrong...\n\n\n{[0109|00080700]}Every year I offer him an entire\nbasin full of my {color[0000]}pumpkin soup{color[ffff]}!\n\n\nBut lately a huge thunderhead has\nbeen brewing there, and I haven't yet\nmade this year's offering. I tell you,\nI feel horrible about it!
BAR_NUSHI_05	{[0109|000d0d08]}You say you'll deliver a pot of my soup\nto Levias?\n\n\n{[0109|00000700]}{[0106|fdcd]}Huh. {[0106|00cd]}I don't know how you plan to fly\ninto that huge thunderhead brewing\nout there, but...\n\n{[0109|000b1000]}If that's the case, I'm going to do\neverything I can to make Levias the\nbest batch of soup ever!
BAR_NUSHI_10	{[0109|00000900]}You wait right here! I'm getting\ninspired to fire up some soup like I've\nnever souped before!
BAR_NUSHI_05_01	{[0109|000b1009]}Voilà! Here it is!\n\n\n\n{[0109|000f1100]}I've been cooking this stuff for well\nover 10 years, and I have to say this is\nthe best batch of {color[0005]}pumpkin soup {color[ffff]}I have\never created!
BAR_NUSHI_05_02	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I will signal for the robot.
BAR_NUSHI_05_05	{[0112|00000064]}Miss Fi! I'm heeeeere, bzzzrt!
BAR_NUSHI_05_06	{[0112|00000064]}Oh, this is another heavy load...\nBut don't worry! I can carry anything!\n\n\nI'll be waiting outside. I can take you\nwherever you need to go as soon as\nyou're ready, zizzat!
BAR_NUSHI_06	{[0109|00000004]}The place where I offer soup to {color[0003]}Levias\n{color[ffff]}is inside the thunderhead cloud, on an\nisland with an everlasting {color[0000]}rainbow{color[ffff]}.{[010b|00000004]} \n\n{[0109|00000700]}Oh, you'll know it when you see it.\nGood luck!
BAR_NUSHI_08	{[0109|000f090d]}Hey! What are you thinking?! I go to\nthe trouble of making that soup, and\nyou change your mind before you\ndeliver it?\n{[0109|000a0000]}That robot of yours brought it all\nback here!\n{[0100|ffff]}Sorry!{[0101|ffff]}Try again!
BAR_NUSHI_09	{[0109|000d0900]}Fine, I'll whip up another batch.\nBut only because it's for Levias!
PUMP_SO_01	{[0109|00171411]}Huh... I thought it would sound a lot\nbetter when you played it, just 'cause\nthat's such a pretty little instrument\nyou have there...\n{[0109|00011600]}The customers didn't seem impressed,\neither...
PUMP_SO_02	{[0109|00161309]}You're much better than I expected!\nI think I underestimated you.\n{[0109|00070700]}I hope we have a chance to\nentertain the customers again!
PUMP_SO_03	{[0109|00150d0a]}That wasn't just amazing... That\nblew my socks right off! Your harp\nplaying was even more impressive than\nmy voice!\n{[0109|00070800]}You've got yourself a fan! I hope I'll\nhave a chance to hear you play again\nsometime.
PUMP_SO_04	{[0109|00171411]}I...guess you could call that playing...\nSort of...\n\n\n{[0109|00011600]}To tell the truth, I found your\n“performance" a little lacking.
MASTER_SO_01	{[0109|000f0a0d]}What in the blue sky was that?!\nIs that your sad little idea of what \nmusic is?!\n\n{[0109|000a0900]}What?! Don't look at me like you think\nwe're even now! You're crazy! I'm not\npaying you for that. You're gonna have\nto try again later!
MASTER_SO_02	{[0109|0000000e]}Impressive! I'd say you passed.
MASTER_SO_03	{[0109|000b100c]}Wow... Even I got a little dust in my\neye there during your performance!\nI didn't think you had it in you.
MASTER_SO_04	{[0109|000b0700]}With this, I say we're even! You don't\nhave to work for me anymore.\nGreat job!\n\n{[0109|000e1100]}You know, I'm going to buy a new\nchandelier to replace that old one!\nIt really fancied up the place.\n\n{[0109|000d0700]}Considering all the hard work you put\nin around here, I feel like I should\ngive you a little something. Take this!
MASTER_SO_05	{[0109|00010700]}Maybe you can swing by later. Yep,\nas a customer next time.
MASTER_SO_06	{[0109|000a090d]}And what was that?! Your horrible\n“music" made even Kina's\nperformance look bad!\n\n{[0109|000d0000]}You listen here. I'm not paying you for\nthat little stunt. Got that?!
MASTER_SO_07	{[0109|0000000e]}That was all right, I suppose. Though\nyou could really make Kina smile if\nyou played just a bit better.\n\n{[0109|000e0700]}I'll give you {color[0000]}20 Rupees {color[ffff]}for that\nperformance. Go on, take it.
MASTER_SO_08	{[0109|000b100c]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, that was fantastic!\n{[0109|000c0700]}I'm giving you {color[0000]}50 Rupees{color[ffff]} for that\nperformance!
MASTER_SO_09	{[0109|00000010]}I can't say it knocked my socks off, but\nyou know, for a first try, you did good\nenough!
MASTER_SO_10	{[0109|00000010]}I hate to tell you this, but you need to\nwork on your playing. I'm not shelling\nout hard-earned Rupees for a sloppy\nperformance like that.
MAS_AFTER_01	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}! What do you \nthink of this new chandelier?\n\n\n{[0109|000b1100]}Let me tell you, this beauty set me back\nquite a bit!
MAS_AFTER_02	{[0109|000d1006]}You...think I spent too much on it?!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00080009]}Don't be a wet blanket! It's thanks to\nyour hard work that I was able to buy\nsuch a stunner of a chandelier!\n{[0109|000c0900]}So don't break it!
MAS_AFTER_03	{[0109|00080700]}Anyway, what can I do for you? If it's\nwork you're after, I'm sure I can find\nsomething for you to do. Just for\nold times' sake!\n{[0109|000e0700]}And, of course, I'll pay you for it this\ntime. Want to make some money\nplaying your harp for us? Or maybe\nyou just want some soup?\n{[0100|ffff]}Play harp.{[0101|ffff]}Soup.{[0102|0000]}I'm busy.
MAS_AFTER_04	{[0109|00081000]}I get it. Well, even if there's nothing in\nparticular you need, I hope you'll take\nsome time to sit back and relax!\n\n{[0109|00000700]}Oh, and don't forget to stop and\nsay hello to Kina now, you hear?
MAS_AFTER_06	{[0109|000d0a00]}Come on! Make your mind up,\nwill you?!
MAS_AFTER_07	{[0109|000e1000]}Great! You can entertain my customers\nand put a smile on Kina's face!
MAS_AFTER_09	{[0109|000c0700]}Oh, sorry, but Kina only does \nperformances at night.\n\n\nCome on back at night, OK?
MAS_AFTER_08	{[0109|00000004]}So what will it be?\n{[0100|ffff]}Harp.{[0101|ffff]}Soup.{[0102|0000]}Nothing.
MOB_01	Wow! I didn't know people were\nskydiving over the Lumpy Pumpkin!\n\n\nI heard there are colorful critters that\nsometimes accompany you when you\nskydive.\n\nI wonder if something good happens\nwhen they appear? Seems only right.
MOB_01_01	Say, I wonder how Dodoh's doing.\nHave you heard anything?\n\n\nI know he was working hard to make\na place where we can all have some\nfun and blow off some steam.
MOB_01_02	Have you seen {color[0003]}Owlan{color[ffff]}'s collection of\nplants?\n\n\nI wonder if he's made any new\ndiscoveries lately?
MOB_01_03	With all of her jobs, {color[0003]}Kina{color[ffff]} has a lot\non her plate.\n\n\nIf only there was someone who was\nreally good at digging holes...
MOB_01_04	{color[0003]}Sparrot {color[ffff]}hasn't been seen hanging\naround the bazaar lately...\n\n\nIt's a shame. His predictions were\nso accurate it was spooky!
MOB_01_05	{color[0003]}Jakamar{color[ffff]} is pretty good at fixing stuff.\n\n\n\nI'll bet he can fix Skyloft's windmill\ntoo!
MOB_02	Oh, now I've done it...\n\n\n\nI knew better than to get greedy!
MOB_50	Oh yeahhh... There's nowhere else\nI'd rather be at night!
MOB_51	What? Is something wrong?
KOBUN_B_01	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00120000]}I didn't think I'd see you here.\nBet you're wondering what I'm \ndoing here.\n{[0100|ffff]}Yep.{[0101|ffff]}Not really.
KOBUN_B_02	{[0109|00030104]}I think I mentioned this before, but\nman, I am really into bugs.\n\n\nThat's why I'm out collecting insects\nwherever I think I'll find them.\n\n\n{[0109|00040100]}If you have a Bug Net too, you should\ntry catching some. Heh heh heh...\nIf you don't have one, you can pick\none up at Beedle's Airshop.\n{[0109|00120100]}I'm sure that sweaty shopkeeper is\nflying around Skyloft now...
KOBUN_B_03	{[0109|00040805]}Not really...?\n\n\n\n{[0109|00040100]}I always knew you weren't a bug lover\nlike me...
KOBUN_B_04	{[0109|0003080c]}Oh no... You've gone and made a\nterrible mess of things, haven't you?\n\n\n{[0109|00000100]}Well, now you're going to be in a world\nof trouble!
KOBUN_B_05	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}. If you catch a\nbunch of bugs and you have more than\nyou know what to do with, I'll be happy\nto take some off your hands.\n{[0109|00120000]}But rather than do it here, come by\nmy room in the academy...
KOBUN_B_06	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}. Wanna hear \nsome worthwhile information?\n\n\nEver come across those{color[0000]} big rocks with\nholes {color[ffff]}while you're out flying?\n\n\nWell, there's a mysterious power or\nvortex or something in them. If you\nfly through it, you'll get a {color[0000]}temporary{color[ffff]}\nboost of speed.\n{[0109|00120000]}Skilled bird riders use this trick to\nget across that big sky quickly.
KOBUN_B_07	{[0109|00120001]}Flying through the holes in the rocks\nmakes flying so much faster. But it's an\nexperts-only kind of thing.\n\n{[0109|00030104]}You're more likely to smack into the\nrock and have the opposite effect.\nHeh heh heh...\n
PAN_27_01	{[0109|1a000001]}Welcome! This is the {color[0000]}Lumpy Pumpkin{color[ffff]},\nhome of the finest pumpkin\nsoup in the big, wide sky!\n\n{[0109|1a1a0800]}There isn't much to do here but take\na load off, relax, and enjoy yourself!
PAN_27_02	{[0109|1a000001]}Don't just sit there! I suggest you get\na move on and find my father, or else!\n\n\n{[0109|1a1a0800]}You're going to be in big trouble!
PAN_28_01	{[0109|00000003]}Hey, why are you just sitting there?\n\n\n\n{[0109|000d0700]}Well, I guess we all have to sit and\nponder things once in a while. Good\nfor the noggin, I always say.\n\n{[0109|00001000]}So relax! Take your time, thinker!
PAN_28_02	{[0109|00000003]}Hey, don't just sit there! Haven't you\ngot something to do right about now?
PAN_28_03	{[0109|00000003]}Hey, hard worker. You've gotten a lot\ndone for us.\n\n\nYou're always welcome here, as a \nhandyman or a customer!\n\n\nIf you're itching to do some work like\nyou did before, that's just fine with me!\nI'll even pay you for it this time.

MOTHER_01	{[0109|15090d11]}Kukiel! Kukiel! Where could that\nchild have gone?!
MOTHER_02	Oh, Kukiel... Where did you go?\n\n\n\nWhat will I do if she's been...\nkidnapped?!
MOTHER_04	{[0109|000b0d12]}Oh, my sweet Kukiel... {[0104|000a]}Please...{[0104|000a]}find my\ndaughter before anything bad happens\nto her.\n\nIf something happened... I just...\nI don't know what I would do.
MOTHER_04_01	{[0109|000b0d12]}What is this world coming to?\nThe Isle of the Goddess is falling,\nand there's still no sign of Kukiel...\nOh, my sweet Kukiel...\nPlease, {[0200]}! Hurry and\nfind her!\n\n\n{[0109|00090d00]}You...wouldn't think of abandoning\nthe search, would you?!
MOTHER_05_00	{[0109|150e0d11]}Oh! {[0301]}{[0200]}!
MOTHER_05	{[0109|15090d00]}What perfect timing! You haven't seen\nmy Kukiel, have you?\n{[0100|ffff]}Nope.{[0101|ffff]}Kuki-who?
MOTHER_05_01	{[0109|15090d00]}Oh no! This is terrible! The Isle of the\nGoddess has fallen! I was just\nsearching there for my Kukiel...\n\nHave you seen her?! My Kukiel?!\n{[0100|ffff]}Nope.{[0101|ffff]}Kuki-who?
MOTHER_06	{[0109|150d0d12]}I...I see.
MOTHER_07	{[0109|15090d12]}My daughter! She's a little \nfive-year-old girl!
MOTHER_08	{[0109|150f0d00]}Please, {[0200]}, won't you\nhelp me look for her? I've been looking\neverywhere, but I can't find her!\n\n{[0109|15090d00]}I've asked everyone I could find for\nhelp, and a few people have said she's\nbeen spotted with some unknown\nperson with a scary face.\n{[0109|150b0d00]}Someone else even said they thought\nthey'd seen her carried off by a\nmonster. A monster!\n\n{[0109|150e0d00]}She must have been kidnapped!\nShe's so cute and friendly... Someone\nmust have just walked off with her!
MOTHER_09	{[0109|15090d00]}Find Kukiel, please! Please! It breaks\nmy heart to think she's somewhere\nout there, crying!\n\n{[0109|150f0d00]}Please, {[0200]}!\n{[0100|ffff]}You got it.{[0101|0000]}Nah...
MOTHER_10	{[0109|15090d12]}And you truly consider yourself a\nknight in training? Isn't it a knight's\nduty to protect the townspeople?!
MOTHER_11	{[0109|150c0e14]}Thank you! The Knight Academy\nshould be proud to have a student\nlike you.\n\n{[0109|15000800]}Please, find my daughter quickly!
MOTHER_12	{[0109|000c0e14]}Oh, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00000800]}Kukiel is safely back at home, and\nit's all because of you! I don't know\nhow to express my gratitude.\n\n{[0109|00090800]}I can finally smile and laugh again!\nThank you ever so much.
MOTHER_12_01	{[0109|000c0e13]}Oh! You found Kukiel?\n\n\n\n{[0109|000f0e00]}Hmm. Well, I guess it's good to hear\nshe's at least with a friendly and\nresponsible adult... But I just can't\nwait to see her!
MOTHER_13	{[0109|000c0e08]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, thanks so much\nfor finding Kukiel.\n\n\nI'll need to be sure to find and thank\nthat kind gentleman who kept an eye\non her too...
MOTHER_14	{[0109|00000d0f]}Oh hello, {[0200]}.\nYou haven't seen my husband around, \nhave you?\n\nI know he's curious why the night\nturned silent so suddenly, but it's no\nreason to dash out there. What if he\nbumped into a monster?!
MOTHER_15	{[0109|000c0e08]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, it's great. \nEver since Kukiel came back, she's \nstopped wandering out on her own.\n\nIt's too bad her father can't follow her\nexample. He always slips out to wander\naround town.
COO_00	{[010d|1900]}EEEEEEEEEEEK!
COO_01	{[0109|00000001]}He's not a bad man! He saved me\none time when I almost fell over the\nedge! And he lets me come here and\nscream as loud as I want!\nAnyway, he said it was dangerous to go\nout alone at night, so I'll just hang out\nhere for a while. Tell my mom I'll come\nhome in the morning!
COO_03	{[0109|00000006]}Hey, what's wrong? Why do you look so\nscared? Did something happen to you?
COO_02	{[0109|00000001]}Oh, it's you, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\nUncle Bats told me he wants to see all\nthe grabitude crackles he can!\nBut how's he going to do that?
COO_04	{[0109|00000001]}Heya, {[0200]}!\n{[0104|001e]}Huh? Uncle Bats is a human now?\n\n\n{[0106|fbcd]}...{[0106|00cd]}Awww, that's too bad. I liked his\nflappy bat wings...
SEBA_01	{[0109|00000001]}Oh, {[0200]}! How's it going?\nAny luck tracking down Zelda?\n\n\n.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}I see. Well, we're all pulling for you!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00070200]}By the way, I saw Kukiel's mother\nheading up toward the temple a\nlittle while ago. She looked pretty\nupset...\n{[0109|00081700]}You don't suppose something\nhappened, do you?
SEBA_02	{[0109|00200508]}Huh? Kukiel's gone missing?!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00070800]}We've got to do something! I'll start\nlooking too! Ask around and see if you\ncan find somebody who's seen her,\n{[0200]}!
SEBA_03	{[0109|00001701]}Check the plaza, {[0200]}!\nI'll try some other places.\n\n\n{[0109|00081700]}I wonder if that boy she was playing\nwith yesterday is still around...
SEBA_04	{[0109|00000012]}I still haven't seen any sign of Kukiel,\n{[0200]}!\n\n\n{[0109|00000e10]}Have you been really looking for her?\nYou're not putting it off for later\nor anything, are you?\n\n{[0109|00070200]}I'm doing my best to find her, but\nI can't do it alone. You do the same!
SEBA_05	{[0109|00000012]}I still haven't seen any sign of Kukiel,\n{[0200]}!\n\n\n{[0109|00000e10]}Are you really looking for her?\n\n\n\n{[0109|00000c00]}What? She's safe?!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00070a0b]}That's a huge relief! I'm so glad you\ntracked her down, {[0200]}!\nI knew you'd do it.
SEBA_07	{[0109|0000000b]}Oh, hey, {[0200]}! Kukiel's\nmother must have been thrilled,\nhuh? I'm sure glad you found her!
SEBA_06	{[0109|0000000a]}You should go and let Kukiel's\nmother know! I'm sure she's at\ntheir house near the water's edge.
SEBA_11	{[0109|00000001]}Oh, {[0200]}! How's it going?\nAny luck tracking down Zelda?\n\n\n.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}I get it. Well, all of us here are\npulling for you!\n\n\nBy the way, I saw Kukiel's mother\nheading up toward the temple a little\nwhile ago. She looked really upset.\nDo you know if something happened?\n{[0100|ffff]}Wait, who?{[0101|ffff]}I know!
SEBA_11_01	{[0109|00070801]}Oh, {[0200]}! This is just \nso awful it's hard to believe...\nThe Isle of the Goddess is gone!\n\n{[0109|00000800]}That cute little Kukiel girl has gone\nmissing...\n\n\n{[0109|00000e00]}There's no sign of Zelda. Groose is\ngone... What's this world coming to?!\n\n\n{[0109|00070800]}I'll do my best to help look for\nthem, but this may be up to you,\n{[0200]}!
SEBA_12	{[0109|00000005]}You know, she lives in that house\nnear the water with her husband and\ntheir little girl.\n\n{[0109|00070800]}I don't know what was wrong, but\nshe was definitely upset.
SEBA_13	{[0109|00070806]}...You're just pulling my chain, aren't\nyou?
SEBA_15	{[0109|00000001]}I'm sure you'll find Zelda too!
SEBA_17	{[0109|00070c08]}You probably heard about the Isle of\nthe Goddess, huh? I wonder what\nhappened. It's just crazy...\n\nThere's no sign of Zelda. Groose\nis gone... What is going on around\nhere?!
SEBA_18	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}. Any closer to\nfinding Zelda?\n\n\nDon't go around telling anyone, but\nlately I've been working out {color[0000]}at night\n{color[ffff]}so that I can get strong like you.\n\n{[0104|0005]}.{[0104|0005]}.{[0104|0005]}.{[0104|000a]}No, no, no!{[0109|00000a06]} Please don't come to\n{color[0000]}my room{color[ffff]} at night when I'm training.\nI'd be so embarrassed!
SEBA_19	{[0109|00000005]}Just you wait! I'm going to keep\nworking out at night until I'm\nstrong like you!
SEBA_20	{[0109|00000001]}I've been secretly working out at night\nso that someday I might be strong like\nyou, but...it's not as easy as you make\nit look, {[0200]}.\nYou really are amazing!
SEBA_21	{[0109|00000001]}Oh, how embarrassing... You caught\nme in the middle of my nightly\nworkout routine.\n\nI want to become strong like you, but I\njust don't seem to be making any\nprogress. I'll keep trying, though.
SEBA_22	{[0109|00070a0b]}Hey there, {[0200]}! Thanks\nagain for that {color[0005]}Stamina Potion{color[ffff]}!\nSince you gave it to me, I've been\ndoing push-ups like a machine!\n{[0109|00ffff00]}You'll see! I'll be as tough as you in\nno time!
SEBA_23	{[0109|00000001]}Hey there, {[0200]}! I've been\ntraining hard at {color[0005]}night {color[ffff]}since you gave\nme that {color[0005]}Stamina Potion{color[ffff]}.\n\n{[0109|00101b00]}But, I don't know... It's started feeling\nlike maybe I've reached my peak.\nLike maybe I'm just wasting my time.\n\nI don't know if I'll ever be as strong\nas you, {[0200]}...\n\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}Still, there's nothing to be gained from\nfeeling sorry for myself, so I'll keep\nworking out every {color[0000]}night{color[ffff]}! Come by and\ngive me pointers anytime!
SEBA_24	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}! Any closer to\nfinding Zelda yet?\n\n\nI think I mentioned this before, but\nit's started feeling like maybe I've\nreached my peak. Like maybe I'm just\nwasting my time...\nAnyhow, I'll be here doing my thing at\n{color[0000]}night{color[ffff]}, so come by and give me some\nadvice whenever you've got the time.
SEBA_25	{[0109|00070a0b]}Hey, {[0200]}! How goes it?\nI've been great, thanks to that\n{color[0005]}Stamina Potion{color[ffff]} you gave me!\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}The longer I train, though, the more\nI realize I'll never measure up to you...\nI'm just so...scrawny.\n\nHey, if you're up for it, why don't you\ncome by and visit again some night?
SEBA_26	{[0109|00070a0b]}Oh, hey there, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\n{[0109|0000ff08]}Hmm? The {color[0000]}Ballad of the Goddess{color[ffff]}?{[0104|001e]}\nSure, I know it. Zelda used to sing it all\nthe time.\n\nI'm afraid I don't know the lyrics, but\nI bet you anything the headmaster\nof the academy does.
SEBA_27	{[0109|00070a0b]}Hey, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\n{[0109|0000ff05]}{color[0000]}Two whirling sails{color[ffff]}, eh...? That's a\ntough one. The wind is really strong\nhere in Skyloft, so there are lots of\nthings that look like sails.
SEBA_28	{[0109|00000811]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, this is amazing!\nThere's some kind of beam coming out\nof the Light Tower! I've never seen\nanything like it!
SEBA_29	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}! Did you find\nany trace of Zelda? I hope she gets\nback soon.
MALE_00	{[0109|00000001]}Whoa! What's the matter,\n{[0200]}? You look pale!\n\n\n{[0100|ffff]}It's Kukiel!{[0101|0000]}Do I?
MALE_01	{[0109|00000506]}What?! Kukiel is missing?\n\n\n\n{[0109|00000500]}She was abducted by a monster?!\n\n\n\n{[0109|000b0400]}You don't think this has anything to\ndo with all those silly stories about\na horrifying monster that's been\nliving here in Skyloft for ages, do you?\n{[0109|000a0500]}People say the creature appears in\nthe dead of night, scaring folks and\neven taking away children!\n\n{[0109|00000400]}Probably nothing more than a scary\nstory some older brother made up to\nterrorize his younger siblings, but\nstill...it makes me wonder.
MALE_02	{[0109|00000004]}Well, it looked that way to me.\nIf nothing is wrong, though, I guess\nthere's nothing to worry about!
MALE_03	{[0109|000b0e01]}I heard you won the Wing Ceremony!\nCongratulations! That's incredible!\n\n\n{[0109|00000a00]}Hey, you don't seem all that happy\nabout winning. What's the matter?
MALE_04	{[0109|00000009]}Oh! Kukiel turned up OK?!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00000e00]}You were the one who found her?\nNice work! That's showing 'em what\na student of the Knight Academy\ncan do!\n{[0109|00000400]}You should go and let her mother\nknow she's safe! Their house is down\nnear the water's edge.
MALE_05	{[0109|000a0a12]}How weird... I can't see the Statue of\nthe Goddess for some reason.\nThat's weird...\n\nWell, never mind that.
MALE_07	{[0109|000a0c12]}What was that thunderous rumbling\njust now?
MALE_06	{[0109|00000006]}Kukiel's mother was calling for her\nlike she was worried. I wonder what\nhappened...
FEMALE_00	{[0109|00001513]}Did you hear? A child who'd been\nplaying in the graveyard went missing.\n\n\n{[0109|00121500]}Can you believe it? Do you really think\nthere are monsters abducting children\nin our little town?\n{[0100|ffff]}I do!{[0101|0000]}I dunno...
FEMALE_01	{[0109|00010c06]}What?! So there's a chance she\nwas dragged off by a monster?\n\n\n{[0109|00000c00]}Let's not be ridiculous here.\nThis monster business is going a\nbit far. {[0104|001e]}Oh{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}\n\n{[0109|00090200]}Now that you mention it, there's an\n{[010b|00000004]}{color[0000]}old man{color[ffff]} who lives near here who's\nalways ranting about hidden monsters\nhere in Skyloft...\n{[0109|00120200]}Everyone knows he's a little loony,\nthough, so no one takes him seriously.
FEMALE_03	{[0109|00121557]}Nothing fazes you, does it? A child\njust vanished from our little village!
FEMALE_02	{[0109|00110200]}You want to know where the\nold man is?\n\n\n{[0109|00000200]}I'd imagine he's at the {color[0000]}Lumpy\nPumpkin{color[ffff]}, to the east of here, as usual.\n\n\n{[0109|00120200]}You'll need to fly your bird there,\nof course!
FEMALE_04	{[0109|00000501]}Oh! So you won the Wing Ceremony\nand graduated to the senior class?\n\n\n{[0109|000c0200]}I can tell by that handsome knight's\nuniform you're wearing! It looks\nvery dashing on you.\n\n{[0109|000c0500]}One step closer to knighthood, eh?
FEMALE_05	{[0109|00090257]}Hmm.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.? The girl who went missing has\nbeen found safe?\n\n\nI see. So she wasn't abducted after all.\nThat's a relief to hear!\n\n\n{[0109|00000609]}Well, anyway, I guess that case is\nclosed! Great work, valiant knight!
FEMALE_06	{[0109|00091501]}Sweet mercy... First the ground starts\nshaking... Next thing I know, the whole\nIsle of the Goddess disappears!\n\n{[0109|00120200]}Oh, by the way...
FEMALE_10	{[0109|00000013]}That was some real shaking there!\nWhat do you suppose could have\ncaused it?\n\n{[0109|00120200]}Oh, and while I've got you here...
FEMALE_07	{[0109|00001504]}There's talk going around that a little\ngirl has disappeared!
FEMALE_08	{[0109|00000001]}So you went and spoke to that old\npumpkin chugger, did you?\n\n\nHmm. He told you that you should\n{color[0004]}deal a blow{color[ffff]} to the {color[0000]}gravestone nearest\nthe tree{color[ffff]} and then {color[0004]}move{color[ffff]} it...to find\na monster?\n{[0109|00001513]}Probably just a lot of hot air{[0106|fbcd]}...{[0106|00cd]}\nEither way, you're better off not\nwalking around outside after dark.
FEMALE_09	{[0109|00001557]}Hmm.

KID_00	{[0109|00101301]}Hmm... I wonder how I can get my\nhands on a Bug Net from Beedle's\nAirshop.\n{[0100|ffff]}Where's Kukiel?{[0101|ffff]}Airshop?
KID_01	{[0109|00000006]}Kukiel?\n\n\n\n{[0109|00120900]}Well, I did see her playing over\nby the {color[0000]}graveyard{color[ffff]} yesterday...\n\n\n{[0109|000a0900]}My mom called me home, so I left.\nI don't know what she did after that.\n\n\n{[0109|00010900]}Why? Did something happen?
KID_02	{[0109|00000004]}I'm trying to think up a way to get\nBeedle's Airshop to stop.\n\n\n{[0109|00120900]}There's a bell hanging down from\nit, and I hear if you ring it, Beedle\nwill stop for you.\n\n{[0109|00101300]}But being up that high, you'd have\nto {[010b|00000004]}{color[0000]}launch{color[ffff]} something at it to have\nany hope of hitting that bell.\n\nIf you ever look around and can't see\nthe shop, try opening your {color[0004]}map{color[ffff]}!
KID_03	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, look up there! It's {color[0003]}Beedle's\nAirshop{color[ffff]}! It's here!\n\n\n{[0109|000a1300]}He sells {color[0000]}Bug Nets{color[ffff]} there! I want one\nsooooo bad!\n\n\n{[0109|00120900]}There's a bell hanging down from the\nshop, and I hear if you ring it, Beedle\nwill stop for you and pick you up!\n\n{[0109|00101300]}But that bell is up off the ground...\nYou'd have to {[010b|00000004]}{color[0000]}launch{color[ffff]} something at it\nto have any hope of ringing it!
KID_04	{[0109|00000001]}Oh, Kukiel's safe?!\n\n\n\n{[0109|000f1300]}I hope she'll be allowed to come out\nand play! I was worried she got eaten!
KID_05	{[0109|00000001]}I have to figure out a way to get up\nto Beedle's Airshop soon so I can\nget a Bug Net too!\n\nThen I'm going straight to the Scrap\nShop to get Gondo to upgrade it and\nmake it even bigger!
KID_06	{[0109|00000001]}Ahhh, the wait is killing me! I've got\nto have a Bug Net! How can I get up to\nBeedle's Airshop?!
KID_07	{[0109|00000001]}The Statue of the Goddess is gone!\nWhat are we gonna do?!\n\n\nThat was easily the best place in the\nwhole world to catch bugs!
KID_08	{[0109|00000001]}Hi, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\nWHAT? You went to Beedle's Airshop?\nWithout me?! That's so unfair!
KID_09	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}!\nLook at the Light Tower!\n\n\nThere's a beam of light shooting out\nof it! How cool is that?!
KID_10	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}! Is it true you\ncan catch more than just bugs with a\n{color[0000]}{[0201|0047]}{color[ffff]}?\n\nThe guy at the Scrap Shop said you can\nuse one to catch all kinds of stuff...\nlike things you'd never even think of!
KID_11	{[0109|00000001]}Yo, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\nHuh? The {color[0000]}lyrics{color[ffff]} to a song Zelda\nwas singing?\n\n\nWhat's a {color[0000]}lyric{color[ffff]}? Is that some kind of\nbug? I don't get it. I'm so confused...
KID_12	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}! I haven't seen\nGroose around lately. I wonder if he\ngot into big trouble and now he has to\ngo to detention at the academy...
KID_13	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}! Strich taught\nme some great {color[0000]}bug-catching\ntechniques{color[ffff]}!\n\nHe said it works better if you swing\nthe net to your side instead of over\nyour head!\n\nHe also said it's best to sneak up on\nthe bugs slowly and then swing fast!
KID_14	{[0109|00000001]}Hi, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\nHuh? {color[0003]}Try and force{color[ffff]}{[0106|fbcd]}...?{[0106|00cd]} {[0104|0014]}What are you\ntalking about? Sometimes you're so\nweird...
RIP_00	{[0109|00000002]}What's up, {[0200]}?
RIP_01	So you're curious about that windmill,\neh?\n\n\nPretty smart design, I gotta say. \nSee, you can turn the windmill so that\nit can always catch the wind no matter\nwhich way it's blowing.
RIP_01_01	But... Well, there used to be this little\n{color[0000]}propeller{color[ffff]} attached to the windmill so\nthat you could turn it.\n\nThe thing flew off ages ago. It must\nhave dropped down off the edge, down\nbeneath the clouds.
RIP_01_02	The windmill's been uselessly sitting\nthere ever since.
RIP_02	{[0109|000c0800]}You wanna know if I could fix the\nwindmill if you brought back the\npropeller?\n\nWell, if I had the propeller, I could\nprobably rig something together to\nget it back on there, sure...
RIP_02_01	But how would you even go looking\nfor the propeller in the first place?\nOnce something falls through the\nclouds, it's gone for good.
RIP_03	{[0106|fccd]}...{[0106|00cd]}{[0109|000c0c13]}Hang on.\n\n\n\nCome to think of it, {color[0003]}Gondo{color[ffff]} at the Scrap\nShop told me that someone in his\nfamily once used a {color[0000]}flying robot{color[ffff]} to haul\njunk back from beneath the clouds.\nBut we're talking about a tale that's\nbeen passed down over a lot of years,\nso I wouldn't put much stock in it.
RIP_04	{[0109|00000005]}Dredging things up from some mystical\n“world beneath the clouds" that doesn't\neven exist? Sounds like a lot of hot air.\n\n{color[0003]}Gondo{color[ffff]} actually bought into the whole\nthing, though. That's why he's always\ntinkering with that busted old robot.
RIP_05	{[0109|00000013]}Whoa! Isn't that...the beat-up\nold robot from Gondo's place?!
RIP_06	Wait just a second...\n\n\n\n{[0104|0014]}Is that...{[0104|0028]} It is! That's the {color[0000]}windmill\npropeller{color[ffff]}! That thing was supposed to\nhave fallen down below the clouds!\n\n{[0109|000c0c00]}Are you saying that whole story handed\ndown through Gondo's family was\nactually true?\n\nHmm... Somehow I get the feeling\nthis is all some elaborate prank, but I\nguess I'll try to fix this thing...
RIP_07	This goes in here... And I just crank\nthat a few clicks...
RIP_08	{[0109|000a010e]}Phew!
RIP_08_01	{[0109|000c0c00]}That ought to do it! If you can find\nsome way to spin the propeller, you can\nprobably turn the windmill around.
RIP_08_02	{[0109|00000100]}{[0108|ffcd]}Honeeeeey! Honeeeey?
RIP_09	{[0109|00050714]}Oh no! I think I might've promised my\nwife I'd fix our cupboard! I swear that\nwoman's always looking for somebody.
RIP_09_01	{[0109|00050714]}Oh, no! I just remembered I'm\nsupposed to be looking for Kukiel!
RIP_11	{[0109|000c0c00]}See you around, {[0200]}!
RIP_14	{[0109|000c0c00]}Catch you later, {[0200]}!\nIf you happen to see Kukiel, let me\nknow, all right?
RIP_12	{[0109|00000001]}Thank you so much for tracking down\nKukiel, {[0200]}! It's such a \ngorgeous day today too.\n\nOn a day like today, there's nothing I'd\nlove more than to head over to the\nLumpy Pumpkin for a sip of soup.\n\nBut of course my wife asked me to fix\nthe cupboard, so I'm not going\nanywhere.\n\nSigh... The story of my life...
RIP_13	{[0109|0000000e]}Hey, {[0200]}. Still no sign of \nKukiel! Even I'm starting to get a\nbit worried...\n\nHelp keep an eye out for her, all right?

PRIEST_01_01	{[0109|00000009]}Hah! Surely it wouldn't cause you\npain to listen to one of my concerns\nfor once!
PRIEST_01_02	Actually, let's talk about this matter\nanother time. Since Kukiel has gone\nmissing, her mother has asked me to\nhelp with the search.\nIf you have the time, I'm sure she'd\nappreciate your help as well.
PRIEST_01_03	{[0109|00000001]}Oh, {[0200]}! How did it go?\nWere you able to hear what Levias\nhad to say?\n\n...I see! I was right, then. There is\nsomething special about you. I have a\nfeeling you and that vibrant Loftwing\nof yours will be just fine.\nThe road ahead of you certainly won't\nbe a smooth one, but don't lose faith!
PRIEST_02	{[0109|00000013]}Ahem. By the way...would you be\nwilling to listen to a little request\nof mine as well?\n\nAs I'm sure you're aware, I'm the\neminent authority on plant collecting\nin Skyloft. If I do say so myself...
PRIEST_02_01	{[0109|000a0a09]}Ha! I suppose you do have other\nmatters to be minding. Just don't\nforget to stop and take a moment for\nyourself and relax now and again!\nIf you're always so focused on the\ntask at hand, you'll wear yourself out.
PRIEST_02_02	{[0109|00000000]}But you see...I have begun to fear that\nI have collected everything I can hope\nto collect. My plant collection now\nfeatures every known species.\nI've started wondering if, in light of\nyour travels, there isn't somewhere you\nmight be able to discover something\nnew for me.\n{[0109|00090a0f]}What do you think? Would you be\nwilling to look for a new plant species\nfor me? Perhaps something exotic...\nThe kind that would turn a few heads?\n{[0100|ffff]}I'll try.{[0101|0000]}Maybe later.
PRIEST_02_04	{[0109|00000001]}Oh! Have you decided to help me\nafter all, {[0200]}?\n\n\nCollecting exotic plants is my passion!
PRIEST_02_03	{[0109|000a0a03]}Aha! I knew you would be willing\nto help me out, {[0200]}.\n\n\nI'm truly sorry to trouble you, but\nplease try to bring me something\nrare... Something no one will have\nseen before!
PRIEST_03	{[0109|00000001]}How goes the search for exotic flora?\nAny luck finding new varieties of\nexotic plant species?
PRIEST_03_01	{[0109|00000009]}Ha! I knew you would lend me a\ngreen thumb, {[0200]}!\nThank you in advance!
PRIEST_04	{[0109|00000053]}This...this is... Unbelievable! You've\nfound me an entirely new plant species!\nIt's precisely what I wanted!
PRIEST_04_01	Hmm... Fascinating! Should this\nactually be classified as flora or\nfauna...? I mean, plant or animal?\n\nHmm... You know, this may very well\nmark the discovery of a new type of\nspecies altogether!
PRIEST_04_02	{[0109|0000000a]}OH! How incredible!\n\n\n\nThe world is still full of new plants\nwaiting to be discovered, isn't it?\nI can barely contain my excitement!
PRIEST_04_03	Oh, {[0200]}! You have\nno idea what this means to me! \nThank you so much!\n\nI'll take great care of this plant...life-\nform... Whatever it is. If you should\nhappen across any other interesting\nspecimens, be sure to let me know!
PRIEST_04_04	Oh, {[0200]}! The world is\nbursting with undiscovered surprises,\nisn't it? I wonder how many\nunidentified plants are still out there.
PRIEST_05	{[0109|000e050a]}You know, the longer I spend with this\nplant, the more interested I become!\n\n\n{[0109|00000500]}Just how much of this thing is a\nplant and how much an animal, do\nyou suppose? Fascinating!
PRIEST_06	Can you believe the Isle of the Goddess\nis gone? The thought boggles the mind.\n\n\nI couldn't believe it until I went and\nconfirmed the truth of it with my own\neyes!\n\nTerrible though it is, the headmaster\nhas informed me that it was a price we\nhad to pay to save Zelda. We're\ncounting on you to find her!
MORIE_01	{[0109|00090011]}Keeee-paleeep! I'm not used to getting\nstared at like this. It's making me\nblush!
MORIE_02	{[0109|00000004]}This guy here says people will probably\nbe surprised when they see me because\nI don't look like a plant, koo-kwee.\n\n{[0109|00000012]}So in the meantime, kew-kaloo, I've\nbeen told to sit here and not move\na leaf.\n\n{[0109|00090013]}This isn't any different from my\nlife in the forest, kweee!

CAP_14_01	{[0109|00000003]}Hey! It's {[0200]}!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00090200]}So you still want to get in some sword\npractice, even though today is the Wing\nCeremony? I'm impressed.\n\nThe sword is in the back room.\nGo on back there and get it.\n\n\nI'll be here for a while, so if there's\nanything you don't understand about \nhandling a sword, go ahead and ask.
CAP_14_02	{[0109|00000005]}Oh yeah? You want to learn about how\nto use a sword?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes, please. {[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
CAP_14_03	{[0109|000e1a08]}That's right. You're good with a sword.\n\n\n\n{[0109|00080200]}But practice is everything! You don't\nbecome a sword master sitting on \nyour rear end.\n\n{[0109|00191d00]}You've got to practice those\nfundamentals, like using {[0204|07cd]}{color[0000]} to target\nenemies{color[ffff]}. It's not glamorous, but that's\na swordsman's bread and butter.{[0111|07cd]}
CAP_14_04	{[0109|00090203]}OK, so the basics of swordsmanship...\nIt's important to think about the direction\nyou're swinging your sword.\n\nIf you swing it vertically, you'll do a \n{color[0004]}vertical slash{color[ffff]}. And if you swing it\nsideways, you'll do a {color[0004]}side slash{color[ffff]}.\nThrust it forward to do a {color[0004]}thrust{color[ffff]}!\n{[0109|00170200]}Next, there's a more advanced technique—\nthe {color[0004]}spin attack{color[ffff]}! It's the perfect move for\nwhen you're surrounded by enemies.\n\n{[0109|00181d00]}If you remember these moves, you can\nhandle yourself in any fight.\n\n\n{[0109|00001d04]}Just remember the fundamentals!\nAlways press{color[0000]} {color[ffff]}{[0204|07cd]} {color[0000]}to target{color[ffff]} an enemy\nas soon as you see it.{[0111|07cd]}
CAP_14_05	{[0109|001c1d03]}Try getting in some good practice on\nthose {color[0000]}logs{color[ffff]}!\n\n\n{[0109|00090200]}If you forget how to swing your sword,\nyou can always check the {color[0000]}Help{color[ffff]} with {[0204|13cd]}.\nDon't ever forget your fundamentals!{[0111|0bcd]}\n\n{[0109|00080200]}Once you've sliced up those logs, I'll\nset it up so you can try out your\n{color[0000]}big move{color[ffff]}.

CAP_14_06_02	{[0109|00081d00]}You can't take swords outside of the\nSparring Hall.\n\n\nWhat do you think you're doing\nsneaking out with that?!
CAP_14_07	{[0109|00000005]}What? {[0104|0028]}Your Loftwing is missing?\n{[0104|0028]}You want to go look for it?\n\n\nWell I guess I could make an exception\njust this once. {[0109|00090e00]}But remember that\nSkyloft is a peaceful place. Only\nknights carry swords!\nSo I don't want to see you swinging\nit around like crazy out there!\nI don't want to get in a ton of trouble\nover this, so here's the deal...\nMake sure you get plenty of practice\non these logs first, and once you get\noutside with that sword, only use it\nwhen you absolutely have to, got it?
CAP_14_08	{[0109|00081d04]}{[0301]}{[0200]}... The headmaster\ntold me about Zelda. Poor girl...\nI'm worried about her...\n\nNow, I don't know all the details of\nwhat's going on here...\n\n\nBut that sword you're carrying isn't\nfrom Skyloft. It's an {color[0000]}ancient artifact{color[ffff]}\nthat can only be carried by the chosen\none.\nAnd since you happen to be the one\ncarrying it, I guess I can figure out\na lot of the rest of this crazy story...

You don't have a chance of\nwinning a battle if your attack and\ndefense aren't balanced.\n{[0109|00080e00]}You can get a {color[0000]}shield {color[ffff]}at the{color[0000]} bazaar{color[ffff]}.\nAlways practice with a shield in your\nhand. It will lead you to the way of\nthe sword!\n{[0109|00091d00]}I'm telling you all this for your\nbenefit, so pay attention!
CAP_14_10	{[0109|00000009]}Impressive, {[0200]}! That's\na nice shield you have there.\n{[0109|00190200]}Well then, it's time I taught you the\n{color[0000]}art of defense{color[ffff]}!\nWe'll start with {color[0000]}basic training{color[ffff]}!
CAP_14_11	{[0109|001c0200]}When you're worried about defense, take\nyour {color[0000]}shield{color[ffff]} out. Simple stuff, I know,\nbut you need to review the basics!\n\n{[0109|000e0200]}To lower your shield, {color[0004]}swing your sword\n{color[ffff]}or press {[0204|01cd]} to put your sword and shield\naway entirely.\n\n{[0109|00080200]}Just be careful when trying to attack\nwhile on the defensive. Every time you \n{color[0004]}swing your sword{color[ffff]}, you move your shield\nout of the way, {color[0000]}lowering your guard{color[ffff]}!
CAP_14_12	{[0109|00091d00]}Why don't you try that first!
CAP_14_13	{[0109|00000005]}Oh? Ready to talk more about the\n{color[0000]}secrets of defense{color[ffff]}?\n{[0100|ffff]}Practical stuff.{[0101|ffff]}Basics!{[0102|0000]}No, thanks.
CAP_14_14	{color[0000]}Practical stuff{color[ffff]}? OK!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00191d00]}If you ready your shield right before an\nenemy attacks you, the force from your\nshield arm will {color[0004]}repel {color[ffff]}the enemy's \nattack. \n{[0109|001c1d00]}This technique is called a {color[0000]}shield bash{color[ffff]},\nand it will make the enemy recoil,\ngiving you an opening in which to\nattack.\n{[0109|000d0200]}This technique is very useful against\nenemies who throw weapons at you or\njust refuse to give you an opening\nfor attack.
CAP_14_15	{[0109|000e0200]}In a real battle, pulling off a defensive\nshield maneuver requires perfect\ntiming. Believe me, you really don't\nwant to miss.\n{[0109|00080200]}Why don't you put what you learned\nto use with that {color[0000]}defense-practice{color[ffff]} {color[0000]}log{color[ffff]}?
CAP_14_15_1	{[0109|00001d00]}I wish there was something else I could\ndo for you, {[0200]}...\nWait, maybe there is... Yes! Get a\n{color[0000]}shield {color[ffff]}and come back here!\n{[0109|00191d00]}Then I'll be able to teach you the\n{color[0000]}secrets of defense{color[ffff]}! It's the least\nI can do for you.
CAP_14_15_3	{[0109|00090200]}I see... Well, trying it out for yourself\nis the best way to learn. Why don't\nyou practice on that defense log?
CAP_14_15_2	{[0109|00001d04]}You know, {[0200]}...\nI just wish there was more I could do\nfor you...\n\nBut I can offer this as a parting gift...\n{[0109|00191d00]}Get ready to learn some new moves!\nIt's time to learn the {color[0000]}secrets of\ndefense{color[ffff]}.\n{[0109|00000200]}First, we should start with the {color[0000]}basics{color[ffff]}!
CAP_14_27	{[0109|00010201]}That's a log for practicing your {color[0000]}vertical\nslash{color[ffff]}. Hold your sword straight up, and\nthen swing it straight down to make a\nclean cut!
CAP_14_28	{[0109|00190203]}That's a log for practicing your {color[0000]}side slash{color[ffff]}.\nHold your sword horizontally, and then\nslash it to the side to make a clean cut!
CAP_14_29	{[0109|001d0202]}That log is set up for practicing your\n{color[0000]}diagonal slash{color[ffff]}. Swing your sword\ndiagonally to cut right along the gash\nin the log.
CAP_14_30	{[0109|00080203]}That's a log used for practicing your\n{color[0000]}thrust{color[ffff]}. Move your sword sharply forward\nto thrust. If you need to know more\nabout that, check Help.
CAP_14_31	{[0109|00191d02]}That log there is for practicing\n{color[0000]}defense{color[ffff]}. You don't have a {color[0000]}shield{color[ffff]} equipped,\nso don't mess with it, or it'll send you\nflying!
CAP_14_32	{[0109|00190202]}That log is used to practice defense.\n\n\n\n{[0109|001c1d00]}Hit the log with your sword, and then\nexecute a {color[0000]}shield bash {color[ffff]}when it swings\nback at you.
CAP_14_32a	{[0109|00191d02]}That log is used to practice {color[0000]}defense{color[ffff]}.\nYou don't have a {color[0000]}shield{color[ffff]} equipped,\nthough, so don't mess with it, or it'll\nsend you flying!
CAP_14_33	{[0109|00081908]}You really are a strong swordsman. \nEasy to teach too. You make this\ninstructor proud!\n\n{[0109|00090200]}Are you ready to try a {color[0004]}spin attack{color[ffff]}?\n{[0100|ffff]}OK!{[0101|0000]}Not yet.
CAP_14_34	{[0109|00080200]}Great! Now I'm going to surround you\nwith logs. Use a {color[0004]}spin attack{color[ffff]} to cut them\nall without moving from that spot!
CAP_14_35	{[0109|00170209]}{[0108|02cd]}Good one!
CAP_14_36	{[0109|000a0213]}That's right, {[0200]}!
CAP_14_37	{[0109|00091d04]}What's the matter, {[0200]}?\nYou don't seem your usual self.
CAP_14_38	{[0109|00081d01]}Stand in the center of a pack of\nenemies, and swing your sword with\njust the right timing. That's how you\ndo a real spin attack.\n{[0109|00090200]}Do you want to try again?\n{[0100|ffff]}Please!{[0101|0000]}Nah...
CAP_14_39	{[0109|00171a08]}That sure looked like it felt good!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00090200]}So... Why don't you try a {color[0004]}fatal blow\n{color[ffff]}to close out our session?\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure!{[0101|0000]}Nah.
CAP_14_40	{[0109|00081d03]}All right! When your enemy is down,\n{color[0000]}target {color[ffff]}it with {[0204|07cd]} and throw yourself\nat it to land a {color[0004]}fatal blow{color[ffff]}.{[0111|07cd]}\n\n{[0109|00091d00]}Do a side slash on that log. When it's\ndown, try finishing it off with this\ntechnique!
CAP_14_41	{[0109|00171a09]}{[0108|01cd]}That's the way!
CAP_14_42	{[0109|00190200]}A {color[0004]}fatal blow{color[ffff]} is also an effective\nmove to use right after you've used\nyour {color[0000]}shield {color[ffff]}or a well-placed {color[0004]}spin attack\n{color[ffff]}to knock an enemy on its back.\n{[0109|001c0200]}Oh, but monsters don't stay down for\nlong, so you'll have to land that fatal\nblow quick before they get up!
CAP_14_16	{[0109|00081901]}Hey! {[0301]}{[0200]}! Have you been\nworking hard on your swordsmanship?\n\n\n{[0109|00000200]}Hmm? I smell something...\n\n\n\n{[0109|00001909]}I know that earthy aroma! Isn't that\nmy favorite {color[0000]}pumpkin soup{color[ffff]}?!\n\n\n{[0109|00000200]}I asked the owner of the Lumpy\nPumpkin to bring me some, but...\n\n\nYou went out of your way to deliver\nsome to me?!\n{[0100|ffff]}That's right!{[0101|0000]}Uh, no...
CAP_14_17	{[0109|000e1d00]}Huh... I told Pumm to bring some\nright away, so what is he doing?\n{[0109|00081d00]}You do not want to be around me when\nI don't get my daily pumpkin soup.
CAP_14_18	{[0109|00171909]}YES! Give it to me!\n{[0100|ffff]}Here you go!{[0101|0000]}Sorry...
CAP_14_19	{[0109|00001d00]}What?! Weren't you asked to bring\nthis to me? You think you can tease\nme like this? You DO NOT tease a man\nabout pumpkin soup!\n{[0109|00081d00]}If this soup isn't good anymore, you're\ngoing to have to go get me some more!\n\n\nAnd it had better be hot!
CAP_14_20	Ugh! This is disgusting...{[0104|0014]} It's cold!
CAP_14_20_1	If there are two things I can't stand in\nthis world, it's cold soup and slackers.\nNow bring me another one—and make\nit hot!
CAP_14_21	{[0109|00000013]}Mmm! This is the stuff!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00171900]}Pumpkin soup is best piping hot!
CAP_14_21c	{[0109|00081900]}Well done! Say thanks to the owner\nfor me!
CAP_14_21a	Sooo good!{[0105|001e0000]}
CAP_14_22	{[0109|00000003]}Hey...did you happen to bring more\npiping-hot pumpkin soup?! It looks\nsooo good...\n{[0100|ffff]}Uh...here.{[0101|ffff]}...
CAP_14_23	{[0106|fccd]}...\n...{[0106|00cd]}\n\n\n{[0109|00081900]}HAH! Just joking around with you!
CAP_14_24	{[0109|00171909]}Oh! For me?! I mean, sorry for just\nassuming it was for me...\n\n\nWell, in that case, I'll help myself!
CAP_14_25	Yeah! That hits the spot!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00171900]}I tell you, morning, noon, or night,\nnothing satisfies like Pumm's yummy \npumpkin soup!
CAP_14_25a	{[0109|00080200]}Thank you, {[0200]}! \nHere's a token of my appreciation.
CAP_14_26	{[0109|00091901]}Send my regards to the owner of\nthe Lumpy Pumpkin!
1-Town\120-Nushi.msbt
NUSHI_00	Tell me, boy, was it you who brought\nme this most delectable cauldron\nof pumpkin soup?\n\nI must apologize for my earlier\nbehavior. A most peculiar and irksome\npest possessed me. I was not myself.\n\nBut that business is done with now!\nThe delicious aroma of that soup\nhas restored me to my senses.
NUSHI_00_01	I am the great spirit they call Levias.\nBefore she passed from this world so\nlong ago, the goddess, Hylia, appointed\nme as warden of the skies.\nAnd what do they call you, boy?{[0104|0019]}\nAh, {[0200]}, is it? A rather\npleasing name, that. Your parents\nclearly have excellent taste in names!\n{[0104|0014]}Hmm... {[0104|0014]}You carry a curious sword,\nboy. {[0104|0014]}And I sense a silent power dwelling\nsomewhere in that little frame.\n\nAh, I see it now. {[0301]}{[0200]}, you\nare the goddess's chosen hero.\nHow interesting...\n\nI assume you've come to hear what\nI know of the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}.\n{[0100|ffff]}Right.{[0101|ffff]}You know?
NUSHI_00_02	Do I know? You do realize you are \nspeaking to the great sky spirit,\ndo you not? {[0104|0014]}Bahhh. No matter.
NUSHI_00_03	As I suspected...{[0104|0019]} Listen closely, and\nI will tell you.\n\n\nAs you likely know, long ago, an evil\nforce attempted to take the Triforce\nfor his own.\n\nThe goddess did everything in her\npower to prevent it from falling\ninto his hands.\n\nFor the safety of all things, she hid\nthe Triforce somewhere within the\nrock you call Skyloft. However, its\nlocation has been kept secret. \nEven I do not know where it rests now.\nOh, but the goddess did entrust me\nwith a hint as to the Triforce's location.\n\nThe clue is a song, meant to be played\non the harp you hold. It is known as the\n{color[0000]}Song of the Hero{color[ffff]}.
NUSHI_00_04	The song is the {color[0000]}key {color[ffff]}to revealing the\nsecret location of the Triforce.
NUSHI_00_05	The goddess split this song into four\nparts. She entrusted one part to me\nand the other three to the dragons\nof the land.\nYou must gather each of the {color[0000]}{[010b|00000004]}{color[ffff]}{color[0000]}parts\nof the Song of the Hero{color[ffff]}. Seek out\nthe dragons, and convince them to \nteach you their parts.\nWhen they've taught you what they\nknow, come to me and I will complete\nthe song with my own voice!\n\nThe dragons can be found at Faron\nWoods, Eldin Volcano, and Lanayru\nDesert. Go on, then. Find the dragons\nyou now seek!
NUSHI_01_01	Ho-hohoho! How goes your quest, boy?\n\n\n\nYou must learn the three parts of the\nthe Song of the Hero known to the\ndragons and then return to me\nonce more!\nThe dragons reside in Faron Woods,\nEldin Volcano, and Lanayru Desert.\nGo and find those dragons!
NUSHI_01_02	Gather the parts of the Song of the\nHero from the three dragons\nand then return to me.\n\nThen I shall complete the tune with\nmy own performance!\n\n\n{[0108|ffcd]}It's been quite a while since I last sang.\nAhem-hem... I do believe some vocal\nexercises are in order...{[0108|00cd]}
NUSHI_01_04	Surely you understand what you need\nto do now. The song opens a doorway\nto a trial. The entrance to it is hidden\nsomewhere {color[0003]}in the sky{color[ffff]}.\nIf you persevere through this trial, the\npath to the {color[0002]}Triforce {color[ffff]}will be revealed\nto you, my boy.
NUSHI_01_05	Ho ho! Astonishing. I see you've finally\nfound the location of the Triforce!
NUSHI_01_07	Ho hoho! So you now hold the\nTriforce, do you? Astonishing!
NUSHI_01_06	You know what you must do. Go, and\ndo not stray from the path you know\nyou must walk.
NUSHI_20	I'm unloading this cargo of pumpkin\nsoup here.\n\n\nYou've picked an odd place for\nsoup delivery. Feels dangerous.\nSomething could jump out at us at any\nmoment, hungry for soup...or robot.
NUSHI_21	I'm out of here! See you around, zzzrt!{[0105|00280000]}

AKUM_20	{[0109|00000003]}Stop! Please! I beg of you...\ndon't hurt me!\n\n\nOh goodness, I know how bad this must\nlook to you right now, but I assure you I\nmean no harm! We were just playing\nthe scream-as-loud-as-you-can game!
AKUM_21	{[0109|00000005]}Isn't that a fun game...? Oh, dear...\nPerhaps an explanation is in order! \n\n\nMy name is {color[0003]}Batreaux{color[ffff]}, and I am a\nmonster who resides here in this\nhumble dwelling below Skyloft.\n\nBut please allow me to correct one\npopular misconception. While I'm\ncertainly a monster, I wouldn't dream\nof terrorizing the people of this town!\nYou see, this adorable little girl is the\nonly one who didn't let loose a blood-\ncurdling scream at the sight of me!\n\nSince she began to visit me here, I've\nfelt positively jubilant! You see, my\nheart's only wish is to become friends\nwith the lovely people of Skyloft.\nBut as you can surely imagine, it has\nproven quite difficult to break the ice\nwhen they are struck with paralyzing\nfear at the mere sight of me!
AKUM_22	I assure you, nothing would fill my\nheart with joy more than to be friends\nwith the fine people of this town.\n\nBut as soon as I try to approach any of\nthem and extend my claw in friendship,\nthey run and scream as though they've\nseen a walking nightmare!\nOh, right... Silly me. I've gotten ahead\nof myself! You see, there is an old tale\namong my monstrous kin that goes\nas follows...
AKUM_22_01	It seems that when humans make other\nhumans happy, the happy humans\nproduce a substance known as a\n{color[0005]}Gratitude Crystal{color[ffff]}.
AKUM_22_02	{color[0005]}Gratitude Crystals{color[ffff]} are quite amazing!\nJust looking at them and knowing there\nwas such gratitude in the world could\nturn me from a monster into a human!
AKUM_23	{[0109|00000007]}Oh goodness, nothing would delight me\nmore than to become a human!\n\n\nFrom the moment I laid my regrettably\ndemonic eyes on you, I could tell\nyou had a gentle and generous heart.
AKUM_23_01	Won't you please gather {color[0005]}Gratitude\nCrystals {color[ffff]}and show them to me?\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure!{[0101|0000]}Nope.
AKUM_24	Please, gentle sir! I beg you. Do not\nmake me bend my wings and grovel.\n{[0100|ffff]}OK, fine.{[0101|0000]}No chance!
AKUM_25	Truly?! You'll help me?
AKUM_26	I've heard that you can obtain pure\n{color[0005]}Gratitude{color[ffff]} {color[0005]}Crystals{color[ffff]} by helping people\nsolve their troubles!
AKUM_25_01	They could also be merely lying about\nhere in Skyloft or elsewhere among the\nclouds...anywhere you find people!\n\nI'm sure someone with a heart as pure\nand genuine as yours will be able to see\nthem.\n\nPlease, solve some troubles and gather\nme all the {color[0005]}Gratitude Crystals {color[ffff]}you\ncan find!
AKUM_25_02	Any help you can provide will be dearly\nappreciated. I promise your assistance\nwill not go unrewarded!
AKUM_30	{[0109|00000005]}Oh, dear, I want to be a human so\nbadly it pains me! Please hurry along\nand gather some {color[0005]}Gratitude Crystals{color[ffff]}...\n\nJust come and show me {color[0000]}five {color[ffff]}to start\nwith. If you do a great kindness for\nsomeone, you may even get several\nat once!
AKUM_30_6	{[0109|00000005]}Magnificent! Yes, that is truly a\n{color[0005]}Gratitude Crystal{color[ffff]}!{[0104|0014]} That did not take\nyou long at all.\n\nAs a start, can you please bring me\n{color[0000]}five{color[ffff]} of them?\n\n\nIf you do a great kindness for someone,\nyou may even get several of them at\nonce!
AKUM_36	{[0109|00000005]}That dear girl should be back home\nsafe and sound by tomorrow morning.\nGive her parents my warmest regards\nwhen you see them.\nOh, and good luck gathering the\n{color[0005]}Gratitude Crystals {color[ffff]}I require. To start,\nplease bring me {color[0000]}five{color[ffff]} if you can!\nThat would be so splendid!\nIf you do a great kindness for someone,\nyou may even find several at once!

AKUM_30_02	I'm still going to need more {color[0005]}Gratitude\nCrystals{color[ffff]} to become a human.\n\n\nPlease, won't you aid a poor,\nunfortunate demon in need?
AKUM_30_03	You have made such magnificent\nprogress gathering {color[0005]}Gratitude Crystals{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nPlease just continue helping me a bit\nlonger...
AKUM_30_04	I only require a few more {color[0005]}Gratitude\nCrystals{color[ffff]} to become human. Please\nhelp this needy demon a bit more...
AKUM_30_05	{[0109|00130808]}Ah! Oh dear...now you've done it!\nYou opened it, didn't you?!\n\n\nHuman desire is an insatiable,\nfearsome thing...even to a demon!\nBut then again, I suppose it's also\nwhat makes your kind so intriguing...\nIf your pouch won't open, fear not.\nThat will only happen while you're\ncarrying that medal.\n\nIf you leave it at an {color[0003]}Item Check{color[ffff]}, you'll\nbe able to open your pouch once again.

AKUM_31_02	{[0106|fccd]}...{[0106|00cd]}{[0109|00000007]}Well? How do I look, my dear\nfriend {[0200]}?
AKUM_31_02a	...Oh, you needn't even say it. I can\ntell from the look of sheer\nastonishment on your face.
AKUM_31_02b	My appearance has changed so\ndramatically you've been struck\nspeechless, haven't you?
AKUM_31_03	Allow me to tell you this...there's\nsimply no word in your language to\ndescribe how grateful I am for your\nhelp. I am deeply touched!\nFrom now on, I plan to live happily\nwith everyone else. Not as a monster...\nbut as any other person.
AKUM_31_04	This is an embarrassingly small token\nof my gratitude, but I hope it will be\nuseful to you.
AKUM_32	{[0109|00000005]}Well? Were you surprised? I bet for a\nmoment there you could not recognize\nwho was standing before you!
AKUM_35	It's quite understandable, really.\nEverything is so new and different,\nI don't even feel like myself!
AKUM_37	{[0109|000a0c05]}Oh, thank you so much! Now I can\nfinally walk the streets of Skyloft\nwithout fear of eliciting screams!
AKUM_33	Oh, my! You've gathered {color[0000]}80{color[ffff]} {color[0005]}Gratitude\nCrystals{color[ffff]}! If I'm not mistaken, that's all\nthe Gratitude Crystals in the whole\nwonderful world!\n{[0109|00070807]}Thank you! Thank you ever so much!\n\n\n\nPlease accept this final gift with all\nof my gratitude.
AKUM_01	{[0109|00000005]}Oh, good day, {[0200]}!\nI simply can't thank you enough for all\nyour help! I'm overjoyed!\n\nFor so long, I wondered what it would\nbe like to casually stroll through the\nbazaar, and here I am!\n\n{[0109|00150c00]}And look around... The best part is\nnobody is screaming in horror!
AKUM_01_1	{[0109|00080a0c]}Look how bright and cheery this place\nis! Such a flurry of color and activity—\nit's positively bustling! I could spend\nall day here just taking it in.
AKUM_02_01	{[0109|00150c09]}No, I beg you! Stop! That chest is not to\nbe opened, under any circumstance!\nThere's something unspeakable inside!\n{[0100|ffff]}What?{[0101|ffff]}I want to open it.
AKUM_02_02	{[0109|00130800]}I said NO!
AKUM_02_03	{[0109|00130800]}That chest contains the infamous evil\nof the dreaded {color[0005]}Cursed Medal{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nIf you carry that medal with you, you'll\nfind more Rupees than ever before!\n{[0109|00150c00]}You'll even have better chances of\ndiscovering treasure!\n{[0109|00140a00]}You'll... You'll... Oh, don't make me\nsay it!\n{[0100|ffff]}Sounds handy!{[0101|ffff]}Say...what?
AKUM_02_04	{[0109|00150c00]}It gets worse! Far, far worse...\n\n\n\n{[0109|00140a00]}Any poor soul who holds that medal\nwill find himself {color[0000]}unable to open his\npouch{color[ffff]}!\n\nNo matter how badly you want to use\nyour potions or shields, they will be\ndenied to you! Can you imagine a\nmore gruesome fate?\n{[0109|00150c00]}Please, push any thought of this chest\nout of your mind forever! You must\nnever think of it again.
AKUM_02_05	{[0109|00130800]}Now that you mention it, that does\nsound pretty enticing, but...
AKUM_03	{[0109|00000005]}Good evening, {[0200]}!\nI thought I'd take a refreshing stroll\naround town, and to my surprise \nthere's not a monster to be seen.\nYou don't suppose their disappearance\nhas something to do with me becoming\nhuman, do you?\n{[0100|ffff]}Could be!{[0101|ffff]}No way.
AKUM_03_01	{[0109|00000856]}Goodness, I suppose you are right...
AKUM_03_02	{[0109|00000814]}Please, there's no reason to hide your\ndoubts from me.
AKUM_03_03	{[0109|00080800]}There's no denying that when I was a\ndemon, I must have radiated a fiendish\npower into my surroundings.\n\nNow that I'm human, it seems that\nmost-unpleasant aura has completely\nfaded from this place, like an\nodious aroma in the wind!\n{[0109|00150a07]}And goodness me, I couldn't be more\nelated! Now everyone can finally live\nin peace, and it's all thanks to you.
AKUM_03_04	{[0109|00000a07]}When I figured out that my very\npresence in Skyloft was causing trouble\nfor its good citizens, it was quite a\nmost unpleasant shock.\nBut now I can put that all behind me!\nI feel like I'm finally an ordinary\nresident of Skyloft. Thank you!

TOWN4_00	{[0109|00000001]}Next, a dash of pepper...\n\n\n\n{[0109|00000004]}Delicious! Another culinary delight\nready to be savored and enjoyed!
TOWN4_01	Only one thing to do when you're tired:\nget some sleep. {[0104|0019]}{color[0004]}You can sleep anywhere\nthere's a bed{color[ffff]}, you know?\n\nSkyloft is a different place after the\nsun goes down. It's no lie.\n\n\n{color[0004]}Find a bed and take a nap{color[ffff]} to sleep until\nnightfall. There's all kinds of curious\nthings to enjoy at night...
TOWN4_20	Have you explored Skyloft at night?\nIt's a different place under the cover\nof darkness.\n\nFor example, if you go to the Gear \nShop owner's house at night, he'll buy \nyour treasures.\n\nNow it's true there are dangers to be\nfound at night, but a student at the\nKnight Academy should have no\ntrouble with that.\nAll you have to do is {color[0004]}nap in a bed {color[ffff]}until\nnightfall.{[0104|0019]} That's it!
TOWN4_01_01	I haven't seen the {color[0003]}fortune-teller {color[ffff]}much\nthese days...\n\n\nYou knew his crystal ball got broken,\nright? I just hope he's not sitting at\nhome kicking himself for not\nforeseeing this.
TOWN4_01_02	His place is over on the {color[0000]}eastern\nedge of town{color[ffff]}...\n\n\nIt's a bit too quiet around here without\nhim. Why don't you go check on him?\nMake sure he's doing all right.
TOWN4_01_03	Would you mind running over and\nchecking in on him?\n\n\nHis house is on the{color[0000]} eastern edge {color[ffff]}of\nSkyloft.
TOWN4_01_04	With the fortune-teller back on the\njob, this place feels alive again. \nIt's just not the same without him.
TOWN4_01_05	So the fortune-teller's at home with\na case of the blues, eh?\n\n\nI wonder if he'd come back if we found\nhim a new crystal ball...
TOWN4_01_06	What?
TOWN4_02	So you're on your way to becoming\na knight now, right? Congratulations!\n\n\nBut I'm sure there's still plenty you\ndon't know. Don't forget to press {[0204|13cd]}\nif you need a pointer or two.{[0111|0bcd]}
TOWN4_02_01	Hi there! I hope you're pressing {[0204|13cd]}\nwhenever you need help.{[0111|0bcd]}
TOWN4_02_02	I've been hearing a weird rumor.\nApparently, after {color[0000]}nightfall{color[ffff]}, people\nhave been hearing a woman sobbing\nin the{color[0000]} dormitory{color[ffff]}.\nI tell you, it gives even a big guy like\nme the creeps.
TOWN4_02_03	What? {[0104|0014]}Calling out for toilet paper\nwhile you're stuck in the restroom?\n\n\nYikes, that's rough. I should know—\nI've been there before.
TOWN4_02_04	Huh? A hand? Reaching out of the\nstall?\n\n\nThat...{[0104|0014]}that's one way of going about\nit, I guess.
TOWN4_03	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}! Today's the big\nday, isn't it? You know, the Wing\nCeremony thing!\n\nWin this thing, and you'll get bumped\nup to the senior class.
TOWN4_03_01	Here in Skyloft, it's being able to ride a\nLoftwing that separates the kids from\nthe adults.\n\n{[0109|000a0404]}And if your goal is to become a knight,\nwell, good technique is even more\nimportant. All of us learned to fly the\nhard way: lots of practice.
TOWN4_04	{[0109|00000002]}Ever heard of banging your knuckles\nagainst the door? It's called knocking.\nBarging into someone's house is what\nmost people call...rude.\nAnyway, you're lucky I'm home.\nI'm usually over at the bazaar working\nat my stall, but we're closed for the \nWing Ceremony.\n{[0109|00000015]}Most days at work all I can think about\nis how bored I am, but now that I'm\nnot at work, I'm...even more bored!\nMy life is pretty sad...
TOWN4_05	{[0109|00000001]}Is that you, {[0200]}?\nWhat are you doing up so late?\n\n\n{[0109|00111300]}I'm hungry! My mom's still cooking,\nbut it's taking forever. When will it\nbe ready?
TOWN4_06	{[0109|00000003]}Heyyy! Up to some late-night mischief,\neh? Better watch yourself, or a Remlit\nwill take a bite out of your backside!\n\nMost of us don't go out after dark\nwithout a really good reason, y'know?
TOWN4_06_01	{[0109|00000001]}Heyyy, kid! I hope you're putting ol'\nScrapper to good use.\n\n\nHe's got a bit of a mouth on him, but\nhe's a robot with a good heart. Well,\nif robots had hearts...\n\nJust remember to treat him kindly,\nand everything will work out fine!
TOWN4_07	{[0109|00000056]}Good grief! Will you talk to that boy\nof mine for me?
TOWN4_08	{[0109|00000056]}All that lug does is make one filthy\nmess after another. I swear he leaves\na grease spot wherever he sits!\n\nI know he likes tinkering around with\nhis oily doodads, but I'm drowning in\ndirty laundry here!\n\n{[0100|ffff]}That lug? {[0101|ffff]}Sounds tough.
TOWN4_08_01	That's right! My greasy-fingered son\nwho runs the Scrap Shop in the bazaar!
TOWN4_08_02	It IS tough! That greasy lug nut is\nfraying my wires!
TOWN4_08_03	He's up at unspeakable hours trying to\nrepair that rusty pile of an old robot he\ninherited!\n\nWhat he intends to do with that\nscrap-heap reject is beyond me!
TOWN4_08_04	I thought he would settle down a bit\nand maybe even wash his hands now\nthat he's got that robot up and running,\nbut he's still tinkering away!\nI'm telling you, that boy will never get\nthe grease out from beneath his\nfingernails. Ah...
TOWN4_09	{[0109|0000000a]}Pardon me, {[0200]}.\nYou haven't seen Kukiel, have you?\n\n\nShe's always running off without a\nword to anyone. I don't know what I'm\ngoing to do with her.\n\nI guess she'll never learn unless she\nruns into trouble one day.
TOWN4_15	{[0109|00000001]}Hi, {[0200]}. Have you seen\nKukiel anywhere?\n\n\nI swear that child can disappear in the\nblink of an eye! She's quite a magician.
TOWN4_10	{[0109|00000001]}Hi, {[0200]}! This house\nbelongs to Kukiel. Pssst—by the way,\nthat's ME.\n\nI'm gonna go play with my special\nfriend today! It's going to be so much\nfun!
TOWN4_11	{[0109|00000011]}Zzz...let's play...zzz...\nUncle Bats!
TOWN4_12	{[0109|00000001]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, just look at Kukiel\nsleeping. She sure is a cutie.\n\n\nShe makes all the hard work I do\nmeaningful and gives me reason to\nkeep on doing it.\n\nNo idea who or what “Uncle Bats" is.\nSilly girl.
TOWN4_12_01	{[0109|00000004]}I wonder where that little mischief\nmaker Kukiel's gone off to now.\n\n\nHer mom thinks she was kidnapped,\nbut I'm not so sure.\n\n\n{[0109|000e0d00]}I mean, there's nobody here in Skyloft\nwho would do such a thing, right?\n\n\n{[0109|00000d0f]}I bet she'll show up sooner or later.\n\n\n\nAnyway, keep your eyes peeled, and let\nus know right away if you see her.
TOWN4_12_02	{[0109|00000001]}I heard you're the one responsible\nfor finding Kukiel!\n\n\n{[0109|00000009]}Thank you so much! Just look at her...\nShe puts her parents through all\nthat worry and heartache, and now\nshe's out like a light.
TOWN4_12_04	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}! Have you\ntaken a look here recently?\n\n\nThere's not a Keese to be seen.\nNo other angry monsters either...\n\n\nBeen a while since I could take a quiet\nwalk out in the dark...
TOWN4_12_03	{[0109|0000000e]}What? Are you serious? You found\nKukiel?\n\n\nWhat did I tell you? Nobody here in\nSkyloft would harm a hair on her head!
TOWN4_13	{[0109|00000001]}Oh, good evening. It's awfully late,\nbut is there something I can do for\nyou?
TOWN4_13_01	{[0109|00000012]}I still can't find Kukiel!\n\n\n\nWould you please help me find her?\nJust...hurry!
TOWN4_14	{[0109|00000002]}Hey there, {[0200]}.\n\n\n\nYou know what's funny? Folks here call\nthis the {color[0000]}Light Tower{color[ffff]}. It's supposedly\nhere to help people find Skyloft and\nprevent them from crashing into us.\n{[0109|000f0d00]}But I've never seen any light coming\nout of it. I wonder who built it.\nAnd why...\n\n{[0109|00100d00]}You should climb all the way to the top,\nanyway. There's one amazing view of\nthe goddess from up there.
TOWN4_14_01	{[0109|000f0d05]}Me?\n\n\n\n{[0109|00000800]}No, thank you, I'm good right down\nhere. Me and heights, we don't get\nalong.
TOWN4_14_02	{[0109|000f0d12]}Oh, it's you, {[0200]}.\nLooks like Kukiel's run off again.\n\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}My wife's in hysterics. She's telling\nfolks our girl's been kidnapped.\n\n\n{[0109|00100d03]}But it's Kukiel we're talking about\nhere!{[0104|000a]} You can bet she's just off playing\nsomewhere.
TOWN4_14_03	{[0109|000f0d00]}Let me know if you see her, OK?
TOWN4_14_04	{[0109|00000002]}Hey, {[0200]}! Kukiel's come\nhome!\n\n\nI heard you were the one who found\nmy girl!\n\n\n{[0109|00100d09]}Thanks a lot! The missus is grinning\nfrom ear to ear.
TOWN4_14_05	{[0109|00000002]}Hi, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\nThis is the{color[0000]} Light Tower{color[ffff]}! You should try\nclimbing to the top. It is sooooo cool\nup there!
TOWN4_15_01	{[0109|25070707]}Such a beautiful day, but we're too busy\nto enjoy it. Some things never change.
TOWN4_15_02	{[0109|26070701]}Isn't that the truth! The only thing my\nlug nut of a son is good for is getting\ngrease on his shirt! All I do is laundry,\nlaundry, laundry. It never ends!
TOWN4_15_03	{[0109|27070702]}I hear you! And I'm terrible at washing\nclothes. I wish I could get someone to\ndo it for me.
TOWN4_15_04	{[0109|25070707]}Did you hear the news? One of the\nstudents in the Wing Ceremony has\nlost his bird. It's gone missing!
TOWN4_15_05	{[0109|26070701]}Oh, really? That's terrible!
TOWN4_15_06	{[0109|27070702]}To tell the truth, I'm not comfortable\naround birds. It's their talons—they\nlook so sharp and painful!
TOWN4_16	Let me give you some information you\nmight find useful somewhere down\nthe line.\n\nThe Knight Academy you and your\nfriends attend produces some\nfirst-class Loftwing riders.\n\nKeep your nose to the grindstone,\nand you might find yourself soaring\nthrough the skies and protecting the\ngood folk of Skyloft too.\nDon't know if you've met 'em or not,\nbut the rescue knights save anyone\nclumsy enough to fall off of Skyloft.\n\n{[0109|00010700]}Only the Knight Academy's seniors are\ninvited to join that group. They're the\nbest of the best!\n\nYou might just have what it takes to\njoin them, but don't think it'll be easy.\nNo slacking, you hear!\n\n{[0109|00070700]}Guess I should tell you my grandson's\none of 'em! Heh {[0104|0005]}heh {[0104|0005]}heh.
TOWN4_16_01	Heh heh heh. Seems like you're on the\nroad to success, little friend. How 'bout\nI buy us a beverage?\n{[0100|ffff]}Thanks! {[0101|0000]}Nah.
TOWN4_16_02	Hmph! No time for an old-timer...\nI see how it is.
TOWN4_16_03	{[0109|00010700]}There's a good lad. Cheers!
TOWN4_16_04	{[0109|00070700]}That's the stuff! There we go!
TOWN4_16_05	Stop by and chat with me once in a\nwhile, you hear? I may be old, but I'm\nnot boring.
TOWN4_16_06	Let me tell you something that may\ncome in handy.\n\n\nWhen you're out on the skies, you might\nsee{color[0000]} ring-shaped rocks {color[ffff]}now and again.\n\n\n{[0109|00010700]}I've heard there's some kind of \nunknown energy that builds up in the \ncenter of those big rocks.\n\nSo get this: if you fly your Loftwing\nthrough a hole, you'll come blasting\nout like you were shot out of a cannon.\n\n{[0109|00070700]}I hear all the hotshot knights use this\ntrick to cover huge distances in a\nhurry.
TOWN4_16_07	Let me share a bit of wisdom with you.\n\n\n\n{[0109|00010700]}The sky is filled with floating islands\nof all shapes and sizes. Skyloft just\nhappens to be the one we call home.\n\nAnd no one knows when they were\ncreated or just how it is they stay\nairborne.\n\n{[0109|00070700]}The only thing I can tell you with any\ncertainty is that we owe all of it—and\nthat includes our life here—to the\ngenerosity of the goddess.
TOWN4_16_08	Listen—here's a little information you\nmay find useful.\n\n\nAre you using those {color[0005]}Stamina Potions\n{color[ffff]}they're selling over at the bazaar?\n\n\n{[0109|00010700]}It's great stuff! Drink some of that,\nand your stamina gauge doesn't empty\nout so darn fast.\n\nAnd it's not just for running, either!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00070700]}You can do spin attacks without getting\ntired so easily! I suggest you carry one\naround in case you tangle with\nsomething big and nasty.
TOWN4_17	You looking to get your grub on?\nThe food here is sooooo good!\n\n\nYou gotta be patient, though. It seems\nlike you wait forever for anything\naround here.
TOWN4_18	{[0109|00000004]}Hi, {[0200]}. Are you tired?\nYou look beat.\n\n\nI know how you feel! I'm always up\nfor a quick nap.\n\n\n{[0109|00010d00]}You just make yourself at home.
TOWN4_19	Mirror, mirror, on the wall...\nWho's the loveliest of them all?
TOWN4_19_01	{[0109|22000002]}That IS what you were thinking,\nright, {[0200]}?
TOWN4_21_01	{[0109|12110016]}Th-{[0104|000f]}thanks for your help!
TOWN4_21_02	{[0109|14080913]}Don't you mention it!\n\n\n\nI guess I should hustle over and say\nhello to your mother too.\n\n\nI'm sure she's just like you, Pipit—\ntrustworthy and dependable.
TOWN4_21_03	{[0109|12090c18]}Whoa! Uhhhh, that's moving a bit too\nfast, don't you think?
TOWN4_21_04	{[0109|14000005]}Of course not! Don't be silly. It's best\nto get these things sorted out right\naway.\n\n{[0109|14080913]}I hope you'll invite me to your house\nnext time.
TOWN4_22_01	{[0109|000e0812]}This is unbelievable... The goddess\nstatue is gone!\n\n\n{[0109|000f0d00]}Would somebody please explain just\nwhat's going on here in Skyloft?
TOWN4_22_02	And my little girl, Kukiel, still hasn't\ncome home. I'm starting to get\nworried.\n\n{[0109|00000800]}Would you please go and look for\nher, {[0200]}?
TOWN4_23	It may look like my master only tinkers\nwith machines as a hobby, bzzt, but\nthat's not the whole story...vrrrrm...\n\nHe's building an automatic washing\nmachine for his mother, bzzt-CLANG!\n\n\nIsn't that great, vrrrrm?\n\n\n\nHe's not at all like a certain someone\nI know who drags Mistress Fi around\nthe world without a care for her\nsafety or happiness, bzzat!
TOWN4_25	{[0109|00000005]}Man, it feels good to just sit here and\nrelax.\n\n\nI like to kick back here and spend time\nthinking about that girl.\n\n\n{[0109|000a0c00]}Yep, {color[0003]}Kina {color[ffff]}is the best thing about the\nold pumpkin bar. She's adorable!
TOWN4_25_01	{[0109|00001104]}I wonder what they're talking about\nover there. It looks pretty serious.
TOWN4_25_02	{[0109|00001101]}Hey! Shouldn't you rush off and look\nfor your bird? I think you should.
TOWN4_27	{[0109|00000004]}Hey, mister! Did you know the goddess\nis gone?\n\n\n{[0109|00000011]}Do you think she got mad and left\n'cause I never listen to my mom\nand dad?
TOWN4_28	{[0109|0009030a]}HEY!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00ffff04]}Oh... {[0104|0014]}I guess it's OK as long as you're\ngoing to just sit.\n\n\n{[0109|00ff03ff]}But listen up! THAT is an expensive\nchair, and if you get it dirty... Well, I\ncan't be held responsible for what\nhappens.
TOWN4_29	You're too late for breakfast.\nWe stopped serving hours ago.\nYou'll have to wait for lunch!
TOWN4_31	{[0112|00000064]}Zrrrt! This is the entrance to the\nvolcano! {[0104|001e]}I better get there before\nMaster Shortpants!
TOWN4_32	{[0109|070a0c12]}Uh... {[0108|fecd]}I wonder where she's gone...
TOWN4_33	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, {[0200]}! Nice night for\na stroll outside, eh? I forgot how nice\nit feels to be out here at night with no\nmonsters to bother you.
1-Town\123-Town5.msbt
TOWN5_01	{[0109|00000d01]}Ahh, {[0200]}. Welcome.\n\n\n\n{[0109|000a0900]}How's my Pipit doing at school?
TOWN5_15	{[0109|00000002]}How's my Pipit doing at school?\n\n\n\nHe's a real go-getter, unlike myself,\nso I'm sure I have no reason to worry.\n{[0100|ffff]}Such a mess!{[0101|ffff]}...
TOWN5_15_01	{[0109|00010909]}Oh, you're right... This place is filthy\nagain. It keeps doing that!\n\n\n{[0109|000a090a]}It's just that I hate cleaning, you know.\nIt would be great if someone would\nclean the place up for me...
TOWN5_15_02	{[0109|00010904]}Oh, what's wrong? You just made a\nface like you wanted to say something.
TOWN5_02	{[0109|00000001]}Ahh, {[0200]}. Welcome.\n\n\n\n{[0109|00080900]}So here's the thing, {[0200]}.\nMy house is terribly dirty...\n\n\n{[0109|00090900]}Pipit is always telling me to do some\ndusting around here, but I just can't\nbring myself to do it.\n\n{[0109|00080900]}That's why I wanted to ask you if you\nwouldn't mind cleaning it for me.\nI'll even pay you, {[0200]}.\n{[0100|ffff]}I'm on it!{[0101|0000]}Nah...
TOWN5_04	{[0109|000a0d07]}You will?! Great! I knew you wouldn't\nleave me to sit in this dusty house,\n{[0200]}.\n\n{[0109|00080904]}What's that? ...A broom? You know,\nI don't even remember where we keep\nthe crazy thing...\n{[0108|ffcd]}...Or if we ever owned one...\n{[0109|00090900]}Most of the time I just wait for a good\nstrong wind to come along and {color[0000]}blow the\ndust away{color[ffff]}.\n\n{[0109|00010900]}So look, I don't really care how you get\nthe job done—I just want you to {color[0000]}blow it\nall away {color[ffff]}for me.\n\n{[0109|00080902]}So I'll just leave you to it, then!
TOWN5_06	{[0109|00010d07]}Oh, that makes me so happy! I knew\nyou wouldn't leave me to a life of dirt,\n{[0200]}.\n\n{[0109|00010d00]}So I'll just leave you to it, then!
TOWN5_05	{[0109|0001090a]}Oh...{[0200]}, I was sure\nyou'd help me out!
TOWN5_08	{[0109|00080d01]}Ahh, {[0200]}. Welcome.\n\n\n\n{[0109|00010900]}Do you think you could do some light\ncleaning for me? I've always hated\ncleaning...\n\n{[0109|000a0900]}I'll even pay you...OK?\n\n\n\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure!{[0101|0000]}Sorry, no.
TOWN5_17	{[0109|00000001]}Welcome, {[0200]}.\n\n\n\n{[0109|00080900]}My house is all dusty again. Do you\nmind cleaning it? I'll give you some\npocket money...\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure!{[0101|0000]}No, sorry.
TOWN5_09	{[0109|00080d01]}Do you think you could do some light\ncleaning for me? I've always hated\ncleaning...\n\n{[0109|000a0900]}I'll give you some money, OK?\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure!{[0101|0000]}No, sorry.
TOWN5_29	{[0109|00000002]}Oh, it's so nice to have someone who's\ngoing to do some cleaning around here,\n{[0200]}.\n\nWhen all the dust is gone, I'll give you\nsome money, so make sure you talk to\nme afterward, OK?\n\n{[0109|00010900]}Or are you already done?\n{[0100|ffff]}All done!{[0101|0000]}Not quite.
TOWN5_57	{[0109|000a0900]}Oh, well then by all means, please\ncontinue. I'd start with the floor, as\nit could really use some work...\n\nThere's probably still some dust around\nthe {color[0000]}window{color[ffff]}, the {color[0000]}shelves{color[ffff]}, and the {color[0000]}bed{color[ffff]} as\nwell. You have to keep a sharp eye out\nto get all of it!
TOWN5_84	{[0109|0000000a]}Well, that's too bad... Oh well.\nLet me know if you can help out\nnext time, OK?
TOWN5_99	Hold on there, {[0200]}.\nI've got your reward for cleaning the\nplace. Just come on over here.
TOWN5_10	{[0109|00000d02]}Thank you so much, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\n{[0109|000a0900]}My home is sparkling clean again!\nIt feels so much better when the\nplace isn't under a blanket of dust.
TOWN5_11	{[0109|00000d08]}Oh my! There's no more dust in my\nhome! Thank you, {[0200]}!\n\n\n{[0109|000a0900]}You've brightened my day. Come over\nhere, and let me pay you.
TOWN5_13	{[0109|00010909]}...I can't let you go without your\nreward. Watch out—there's some big\nmoney coming... BAM, {color[0000]}20 Rupees{color[ffff]}!{[0109|000a0d00]}
TOWN5_14	{[0109|00010900]}If the place gets dusty again, I might\nneed you to come back and tidy it up\nfor me. But I'll pay you again, OK?
TOWN5_14a	{[0109|000a0900]}Oh...one more thing.\nDon't tell Pipit about this.\n\n\n{[0109|00080900]}He'll only get angry at me for spending\nmoney on something he thinks I should\nbe doing myself. You can keep a secret,\nright?
TOWN5_16	{[0109|00000001]}Welcome, {[0200]}.\n\n\n\nIf my house gets dirty again, you'll be\nthe first to know!
TOWN5_18	{[0109|00000004]}Oh. Hi there, {[0200]}. \nAre you still working on cleaning the\nplace?\n\nOr are you done for today?\n{[0100|ffff]}All done!{[0101|0000]}Almost...
TOWN5_105	{[0109|00000004]}Leaving already, {[0200]}?\n\n\n\nIf you see Pipit out on patrol, make\nsure you wave and say hello!
TOWN5_26	{[0109|00000001]}Hi there, {[0200]}.\n\n\n\n{[0109|00080900]}Pipit is really angry with me...\n\n\n\n{[0109|000a0900]}He said I shouldn't be spending our\nmoney on a housekeeper.\n\n\n{[0109|00010c00]}...\n\n\n\n{[0109|00080d09]}But...you're not exactly a housekeeper,\nare you, {[0200]}?\nThat makes it OK, doesn't it?\n\n{[0109|00080900]}Anyway, that's good enough for me.\nAs far as I'm concerned, I'll pay you to\nclean my house anytime it gets dusty.
TOWN5_19	We've been over this, Mom!
TOWN5_20	Calm down, Pipit. Don't get so mad...
TOWN5_21	How could I not be mad?!\n\n\n\nIt's been obvious lately that you've\nbeen {color[0000]}giving someone Rupees {color[ffff]}to\nclean the house!\n\nI gave you that money so you could buy\nsome bread!\n\n\nIf you keep spending money like this,\nI won't have any money to go to the\nKnight Academy!\n\nI didn't take that job patrolling just so\nyou could live a life of luxury!\n\n\nYou've got to stop doing this!
TOWN5_22	Oh... Hey there, {[0200]}...\nWhat could you want at this hour?
TOWN5_98	{[0109|120b1100]}You...didn't hear any of that, did you?\nThere's no way you heard, right?\n{[0100|ffff]}Heard what?{[0101|ffff]}Sorry...
TOWN5_22_01	{[0109|12011100]}Nothing... It's nothing.\n\n\n\n{[0109|12080400]}Anyway, I've got to get back out on\npatrol! You take care of yourself when\nyou're out walking the streets!
TOWN5_22_02	{[0109|12011100]}Oh... You heard!\n\n\n\n{[0109|120f1100]}It's true. I'm working the night patrol\nto earn some money!\n\n\n{[0109|12081100]}But don't look at me like that!\nYou're not exactly Mr. Perfect either,\nare you, Mr. Eavesdropper!\n\n{[0109|120c0c00]}Maybe we should just forget about\neverything that happened here tonight!
TOWN5_23	Hey, {[0200]}! It's dangerous\nout at night, so be careful!\n\n\n{[0109|000b0400]}This area is my patrol route.\n\n\n\n{[0109|00080404]}At night, monsters get really active\naround here!\n\n\nIt's the duty of a knight to protect the\npublic from any danger!\n{[0100|ffff]}How admirable!{[0101|ffff]}Duty or job?
TOWN5_23_01	{[0109|00090c09]}Admirable?! Nonsense! It's the bare\nminimum of what people expect from\nus! We are knights in training, and this\nis what knights do!\nThat's the Pipit way! All I need are\nthe smiles of the people I protect as\nmy payment!\n\n{[0109|00080400]}This is what it means to be a knight.\n{[0109|00000005]}I'm sure you'll understand how that\nfeels one day too, {[0200]}!
TOWN5_23_02	{[0301]}{[0109|000c0c17]}{[0200]}! For shame! Why did\nyou decide to become a knight,\nanyway?\n\nFor the money?! How could you be\nswayed by the temptation of material\ngain? Do you have no honor?!\n\n{[0109|00080405]}That's the Pipit way! More than money,\nI love seeing people happy and safe.\nThat's what being a knight is all about!
TOWN5_23_03	{[0301]}{[0200]}! One day you'll\nunderstand what it is to be a knight!\nDon't you worry.
TOWN5_24	{[0301]}You...weren't supposed to see that\nwhole spectacle, {[0200]}. \nHow embarrassing...\n\n{[0109|000f1100]}I feel so ashamed of my mother\nsometimes. She's just so lazy\nsometimes. I don't know what to do.\n\n{[0109|00080c0b]}But I'll be fine. You don't need to\nworry about me.\n\n\n{[0109|00011100]}I still haven't worked out who did the\ncleaning for my mother, though...\n\n\n{[0109|00080c16]}Who do they think they are, getting\ninvolved in our business like that?
TOWN5_24_01	Hey, {[0200]}. I'm protecting\nthe peace in Skyloft!\n\n\n{[0109|000c0400]}Let's make this a safe place to live,\nwhere we all can live in peace!\n\n\n{[0109|00010c52]}Umm...{[0104|001e]} Why are you looking at me so\nsuspiciously?
TOWN5_25	Hey, {[0200]}! It can be\ndangerous out here at night, so be\ncareful.\n\n{[0109|00110c09]}Oh, and about that thing the other\nnight... We agreed to keep that secret,\nright?!
TOWN5_25_01	{[0109|00101100]}Hmm...{[0104|001e]} Recently the monsters that\nusually roam the town at night are\nnowhere to be seen.\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}I wonder what's going on... Not that\nI'm complaining or anything!\nPeaceful nights are the best.
TOWN5_27	{[0109|00000007]}I love to collect antiques, you know?\nAll the things you see in my house\nare very old and valuable.\n\nMake sure you don't break anything!
TOWN5_28	{[0109|00000009]}You broke my antique!\n\n\n\nNext time that happens, we're going to\nhave words!
TOWN5_34	{[0109|1f00000a]}Nooo! How could you?!
TOWN5_32	{[0109|1f090300]}You broke my antique!\n\n\n\nThat's it! You break it, you buy it!\n\n\n\n{[0109|1f0b0700]}Let me see now... That was a very\nexpensive antique, so {color[0000]}about{color[ffff]} {color[0000]}20 Rupees\n{color[ffff]}should suffice!\n\n{[0109|1f010305]}What's that look for? Oh, you think I'm\njust making that number up?\n\n\n{[0109|1f090309]}That's ridiculous! I know the value of\nevery item in my possession, and I\nintend to be compensated in full!
TOWN5_30	{[0109|1f0a0300]}Next time that happens, we're going to\nhave words!
TOWN5_31	{[0109|1f090300]}You broke my precious antique!
TOWN5_95	{[0109|1f0a0309]}That was a very valuable item,\nso you're going to have to pay me\n{color[0000]}30 Rupees or so{color[ffff]}! And I didn't just\nmake that number up!
TOWN5_96	{[0109|1f0a0309]}That was a pretty expensive item,\nso you're going to have to pay me\n{color[0000]}about 20 Rupees{color[ffff]}! And I didn't just\nmake that number up!
TOWN5_97	{[0109|1f0a0309]}That was a pretty nice item,\nso you're going to have to pay me\n{color[0000]}roughly 10 Rupees{color[ffff]}! And no...I didn't\njust make that number up!
TOWN5_103	...But you don't even have enough to\npay! Hmph. The nerve!\n\n\nThen I'll just take what you have on\nyou. And next time, be more careful!
TOWN5_104	...But you don't even have a single\nRupee on you!\n\n\nSo you think you can just wander \nabout, penniless, destroying people's\nthings and laughing in their faces when\nthey ask for money in return?!\nThe nerve! I don't even want your\nmoney anymore. Just get out of my\nsight!
TOWN5_106	...Look, I already know you don't have\neven a single Rupee to your name...\nSO STOP BREAKING THINGS!\n\nGet out of here!
TOWN5_33	{[0109|1f0a0300]}YOU! Did I do something horrible to\nyou in a past life?! Why are you\npunishing me like this?!
TOWN5_59	{[0109|00000001]}Oh. Hey. This is the Item Check.\nBut I bet you're here just to check me\nout, right? Well don't make a habit of\nit, OK?\nAnyway, you need to grab something?\nOr drop something off?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes, please!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
TOWN5_77	{[0109|00000005]}Oh. You're back. I'll hold on to\nanything of yours you want me to.\n\n\nSomething in your pouch today that\nyou want to deposit? Or something\nyou want to pick up?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes, please!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.

TOWN5_37	{[0109|00000001]}Hey. Welcome to the Item Check.\n...Oh, it's you again...\n\n\nYou've been coming by a lot recently.\nYou're pretty much the only one who\ncomes by regularly, actually...\n\n{[0109|00000004]}Hey...wait a second...\n\n\n\nI don't suppose...\n\n\n\nYou don't come by here just to see me,\ndo you?\n\n\n{[0100|ffff]}Uhh, no.{[0101|ffff]}Yes, it's true.
TOWN5_38	{[0109|00000002]}Oh... Right...\n\n\n\nWell, of course. That wouldn't even\nmake sense, right?\n\n\n{[0109|000a0c00]}Oh, it's no big deal that you don't.\nNot at all.
TOWN5_39	{[0109|00000002]}What?! Really?\n\n\n\nYeah, right... You think I'm going to\nfall for that old line?\n\n\n{[0109|000a0c00]}But...if it were true, that might be\nkind of nice...
TOWN5_40	{[0109|00070800]}...Oh! I almost forgot. I still have a\njob to do. Do you have something\nfor me to hold on to?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes, please.{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
TOWN5_41	Hello. Welcome to the Item Check...\n{[0109|00000005]}Oh.

TOWN5_44	{[0109|000a0f18]}I... I do? I don't think I do...\nMaybe you're mistaken?
TOWN5_45	It's not like “Oh, hey, that guy's back!\nI'm so happy!" or anything like that...\n\n\nBut...if you think about how often\nwe meet, you have to admit that our\nrelationship has gone beyond employee\nand customer, you know?\n{[0109|00101405]}Oh no... I didn't mean to... What am\nI saying?!\n\n\nPlease forget everything I just said.\nOK?\n\n\n{[0109|00070800]}OK, get it together...

TOWN5_74	{[0109|00080a09]}...Thank you! I love you so much,\ndarling! I'm sorry I doubted you and\nput you through all that questioning!
TOWN5_83	{[0109|00000013]}...But I understand your true feelings.\nBetter than you know.\n\n\nYou're saying that you cannot give\nyourself over to love just yet...\nThat you have much more important\nthings to do right now.\n{[0109|000e1000]}You have some kind of serious job you\nhave to attend to first, right?\n\n\n{[0109|000d0f00]}If you weren't off on an adventure,\nyou probably wouldn't need to come\nby the Item Check so often.\n\nAnd that's why I won't ask any more of\nyou. I'll just watch over you, protecting\nyou from afar, keeping a vigilant eye\non your items.\n{[0109|000e1000]}And when your important work is done,\nwe'll tell my dad we're in love!\n\n\n{[0109|000b0d00]}Until then, we'll keep our love secret!\nDarling, I... I'll see you again at the\nItem Check.
TOWN5_79	{[0109|000f1214]}...I understand. That's your answer...\n\n\n\nI'm sorry for causing you trouble...
TOWN5_85	{[0109|00000013]}...Don't. I don't need your sympathy.\n\n\n\nI'm fine. I'll get over you quickly...\n\n\n\n{[0109|00140d00]}The next time we meet, I'll greet\nyou as I would any old customer...

TOWN5_88	{[0109|0000000d]}Darling! I told you that we need to\nkeep our relationship secret! If you\ncome over too often, my dad will\ncatch on to us!\nWhat could you possibly want this late?\n{[0100|ffff]}Need to talk!{[0101|ffff]}Nothing.{[0102|ffff]}Deposit items!
TOWN5_89	{[0109|00080008]}I'd love to talk forever with you,\nbut my father is staring at us!\nWe can talk another time!
TOWN5_90	{[0109|00080a00]}Well, aren't you the strong and\ndomineering type? But that's\njust how I like you, my darling!
TOWN5_91	Well, if that's all you wanted, couldn't\nyou have just come to visit me at the\nItem Check during the day?\n\n{[0109|000e1000]}Or are you trying to tell me that that's\nall I am to you?
TOWN5_92	{[0109|0000000e]}Oh, {[0200]}... \nI never knew it would hurt so much...\nto have my heart broken...{[0109|00000014]}
TOWN5_93	{[0109|00000014]}I know I said I'd get over it, but...\nSometimes at night, I feel this pain in\nmy chest... I guess that's why they call\nit a broken heart...
TOWN5_94	{[0109|00000013]}I don't know why, but my father\nhas been in a great mood lately...\n\n\nDoes he even realize that his only\ndaughter has just had her heart\nbroken for the very first time?\nHow annoying...

What luck you have!\nYou've just stumbled upon me, the\ninfamous {color[0003]}Moonlight Merchant{color[ffff]}!\n\nDon't ask how I get my wares, 'cause\nI'm not telling!\n\n\nIf there's a rare bauble or two you're\ndying to get your hands on, I might\nknow a stone who knows a stone who\ncan get them for you...for a price!
TOWN6_01	But...but! Before you go whipping out\nyour Rupees, you should know my\nwares carry a hefty price tag.\n\nPeople who come to me usually don't\nlike collecting treasure on their own,\nor simply can't manage to collect what\nthey need. You sure this is for you?\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure!{[0101|0000]}No way.
TOWN6_02	Excellent! So, tell me, what kind of\ntreasure are you in the market for?\n{[0100|ffff]}{[0201|00ae]}{[0101|ffff]}{[0201|00af]}{[0102|ffff]}{[0201|00b0]}{[0103|0000]}Other.

TOWN6_12	Sorry, friend, that's all I've got to sell\nright now. If none of those did the trick\nfor you, you'll just have to find what\nyou're after on your own!
TOWN6_03_01	OK, one {[0201|00ae]} it is!\nFor {color[0000]}200 Rupees{color[ffff]}, it's all yours!\n{[0100|ffff]}Sounds good!{[0101|0000]}Too much.

TOWN6_03_03	OK, one {[0201|00b0]} coming right\nup! That'll be just {color[0000]}200 Rupees{color[ffff]}, friend.\n{[0100|ffff]}Sounds good!{[0101|0000]}Too much.
TOWN6_03_04	OK, one {[0201|00a8]} it is! It's a steal at\njust {color[0000]}100 Rupees{color[ffff]}.\n{[0100|ffff]}Sounds good!{[0101|0000]}Too much.
TOWN6_03_05	OK, one {[0201|00ad]} it is!\nFor {color[0000]}100 Rupees{color[ffff]} it's all yours!\n{[0100|ffff]}Sounds good!{[0101|0000]}Too much.

TOWN6_04	Fine then. Folks who walk the straight\nand narrow are better off not getting\nmixed up with a shady character like\nmyself anyhow. Know what I'm saying?
TOWN6_05	Puh-leeeze, I've heard that one before.\nYou say it costs too much. I say you\nprobably didn't want it that much in\nthe first place or you'd cough it up!
TOWN6_06	And we have a deal! Here's your\nnot-at-all-shady treasure!
TOWN6_07	Hmm. Looking a little short on funds\nthere, friend. Oh well. When you\nscrape together the Rupees, you know\nI'll be here.
TOWN6_08	Hopefully your purchase lives up to\nyour expectations, fella! If you get the\nitch to buy some more treasure, you\nknow the stone to talk to.
TOWN6_09	Hey there, friend! What luck you have!\nYou've just stumbled upon one of th—{[0104|0014]}\nOh. You again. You looking to buy\nsome treasure or what?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yep!{[0101|0000]}Nah...
TOWN6_10	So you're looking to buy then, eh?\n{[0100|ffff]}Please!{[0101|0000]}Nah...

TELOP_D3	Sky Keep
D3_01_01	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I have information to report.\nI've detected three sources of sacred\npower within this building. This power\nclearly radiates from the {color[0002]}{[010b|00000004]}Triforce{color[ffff]}.\nI've triangulated the three sources of\npower and marked them on your map\nas △.
D3_03_01	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I have new information for\nyou. Analysis indicates that the shaking\nyou felt just now was caused by a\n{color[0000]}{[010b|00000004]}{color[ffff]}{color[0000]}change in the building's structure{color[ffff]}.
D3_03_02	Now that the building's structure has\nbeen altered, it appears you can\nenter the adjacent room.
D3_03_03	I propose you use this {color[0000]}control panel{color[ffff]} to\nmove through the structure and collect\nthe components of the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}.
D3_03_04	By altering the internal structure of\nthis building, you will be able to gain\naccess to other chambers.
D3_04_01	Seek the {color[0000]}gemstones{color[ffff]} that sleep\nbehind each statue. If you strike\nthem in order from lowest to\nhighest, the door will open.
D3_05_01	{[0112|00000001]}Master, look over that way.
D3_05_02	The design carved into the floor there\nis the {color[0000]}mark of Farore{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nI detect the sacred power of the\n{color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]} emanating from its vicinity.
D3_05_03	To reach the area where that mark is\nlocated, I propose you pass through the\ndoor in front of you.
D3_06_01	I have identified the design on the \nfloor there as the {color[0000]}mark of Nayru{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nI detect the sacred power of the\n{color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]} radiating from it.\nUnfortunately, the way leading to\nthe mark is closed off.
D3_06_02	I propose you utilize the nearby\n{color[0005]}Timeshift Orb{color[ffff]} to open a path to\nthe {color[0000]}mark{color[ffff]}.
D3_06_03	There appears to be a {color[0005]}Timeshift Orb{color[ffff]}\nover there.
D3_07_01	The symbol visible on the floor here is\nthe {color[0000]}mark of Din{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nI detect the sacred power of the\n{color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]} emanating from its vicinity.
D3_07_02	Unfortunately, there seems to be no\nway to reach the mark from your\ncurrent position.\n\nI recommend you find another\nentrance into this chamber.
D3_08_01	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I have information for you.\nThe chamber you stand in now is the\nsame one where you previously spotted\nthe {color[0000]}mark of Din{color[ffff]}.
D3_08_02	If you can find a way through the river\nof magma, I calculate a 60% chance\nyou will arrive at one of the sources\nof sacred power.
D3_08_03	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I have information for you.\nI've detected a source of sacred power\nsomewhere within this chamber.
D3_08_04	I recommend you press forward in\nsearch of the power present here.
D3_11_01	{[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}, you have\nreached the mark. Offer your sword\nto it.\n\nIf you do this, I calculate a high\nprobability that you will be shown\nthe way to a part of the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}.

TW_SIREN_01	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}.
TW_SIREN_02	You have entered the last of the trials,\nthe {color[0003]}Goddess's Silent Realm{color[ffff]}.
TW_SIREN_04	When you have filled the {color[0005]}{[0201|0011]}\n{color[ffff]}once more, you shall finally be \nrecognized as the true hero of legend.\n\nOnly then will you be shown the door\nthat will lead you to the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}.\n{[0112|00000002]}Master, I wish you success in this trial.\n\nDo you have any questions before you\nface the task ahead of you?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes.{[0101|0000]}No.
TW_SIREN_25	Which topic do you wish to review?\n\n\n{[0100|ffff]}The {[0201|0011]}?{[0101|ffff]}Guardians?{[0102|ffff]}Waking Water?{[0103|0000]}Never mind.
TW_SIREN_26	Do you have any further questions?\n\n{[0100|ffff]}The {[0201|0011]}?{[0101|ffff]}Guardians?{[0102|ffff]}Waking Water?{[0103|0000]}Never mind.
TW_SIREN_28	{[0112|00000005]}Understood, Master.
TW_SIREN_03	{[0112|00000002]}Master, I await your return in the\noutside world.
TW_SIREN_05	Yes, {[0112|00000005]}Master.\n\n\n\nTo fill the {color[0005]}{[0201|0011]}{color[ffff]}, you need to\nlocate and collect the {color[0005]}{[0201|002e]}s\n{color[ffff]}scattered across this Silent Realm.
TW_SIREN_15	{[0112|00000002]}Master, do you see the glowing\nobject a ways in front of you?
TW_SIREN_16	That is a {color[0005]}{[0201|002e]}{color[ffff]}.\nYou will need to collect {color[0000]}15 {color[ffff]}of them.
TW_SIREN_07	{[0112|00000005]}Understood, Master.\nAllow me to explain.
TW_SIREN_17	If you take even a single step outside\nthe protective circle you stand in, the\n{color[0000]}Guardians {color[ffff]}of this realm will wake up\nand pursue you, {[0112|00000002]}Master.
TW_SIREN_18	If a {color[0000]}Guardian {color[ffff]}manages to land even a\nsingle hit on you, your spirit will\nshatter and you will fail the trial.
TW_SIREN_19	You must collect the {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]} scattered\nthroughout this area and fill the\n{color[0005]}{[0201|0011]} {color[ffff]}without being hit by\nan attack.
TW_SIREN_27	The unusual liquid substance that\ncovers that area is known as {color[0000]}Waking\nWater{color[ffff]}, and it has certain unique\nproperties.\nIf you make contact with Waking\nWater, the {color[0000]}Guardians will be\nimmediately alerted to your presence{color[ffff]}.\n\nPools of Waking Water are located all\nthroughout the area. I suggest you\nwatch where you step...
TW_SIREN_10	When your {color[0005]}{[0201|0011]}{color[ffff]} is filled with\n15 {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]}, your spirit will grow and you\nwill be blessed by the goddess with\na new power.\n{[0112|00000002]}Master, I await your return in the\noutside world.
TW_SIREN_20	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, I can\nunfortunately confirm that you\nhave failed to pass the trial.
TW_SIREN_22	Collect all the {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]} within the Silent\nRealm. I shall await your return here.
TW_SIREN_11	{[0112|00000002]}Master, so long as you have the will and\ndetermination, you can retry a trial\nas many times as you like.\n\nA good strategy is {color[0000]}to find, but then\ndeliberately not pick up{color[ffff]}, the most-\neasily-accessible {color[0005]}{color[0005]}tears{color[0005]} {color[ffff]}until you are\ndiscovered and really need one.\nCollect the 15 {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]} and complete the\ntrial. I will await your return in the\noutside world.
TW_SIREN_12	The locations of {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]} you have\ngathered during your trial are\n{color[0000]}marked on the map{color[ffff]}.\n\nYou will have an easier time\ncompleting your task if you first\nset out to discover the locations\nof all 15 tears.
TW_SIREN_21	{color[0000]}Two types of Watchers {color[ffff]}patrol the\nrealm, looking for intruders. I highly\nsuggest you take caution.\n\nSo long as you do not step into their\nlight, you will remain undetected\nby {color[0000]}flying Sky Watchers{color[ffff]}.\n\nHowever, the {color[0000]}Earth Watchers{color[ffff]}, who\n{color[0000]}hover near the ground{color[ffff]}, will give chase\nif you come too close to them, so {color[0000]}stay\nalert {color[ffff]}and maintain a safe distance.
TW_SIREN_13	{[0112|00000001]}Master, the chances of your not being\nthe chosen hero are increasing...\n\n\nRepeated attempts at this trial have\nscattered your concentration and made\nyour performance erratic. I suggest\nyou rest awhile before trying again.
TW_SIREN_14	I suggest using smart tactics to your\nadvantage. Try {color[0000]}leaving easy-to-collect\ntears {color[ffff]}for when you are being pursued.
TW_SIREN_23	The locations of {color[0005]}tears {color[ffff]}that you have\npreviously collected will be {color[0000]}marked\non the map{color[ffff]}, so make good use of that.\n\nConfirm the locations of all 15 tears\nfirst to increase your chances of\nsuccessfully completing the trial.
TW_SIREN_24	{[0112|00000001]}Master, in addition to the {color[0000]}Guardians{color[ffff]}\nwho will attack you, there are also two\ntypes of {color[0000]}Watchers {color[ffff]}that search for\nintruders {color[0000]}on the ground and in the sky{color[ffff]}.\nThe two types of Watchers exhibit\ndramatically different behavior, so be\nsure you understand how to avoid\ndetection by both.

Demo01_01:01	{[0105|00960000]}It tells of a war of unmatched scale and ferocity,\nthe likes of which would never be seen again.
Demo01_01:08	{[0105|00960000]}One dark, fateful day, the earth cracked wide and\nmalevolent forces rushed forth from the fissure.
Demo01_01:02	{[0105|00960000]}They mounted a brutal assault upon the surface\npeople, driving the land into deep despair...
Demo01_01:09	{[0105|00960000]}They burnt forests to ash, choked the land's sweet\nsprings, and murdered without hesitation.
Demo01_01:03	{[0105|00960000]}They did all this in their lust to take the {color[0000]}ultimate\npower{color[ffff]} protected by Her Grace, the goddess.
Demo01_01:04	{[0105|003c0000]}The power she guarded was without equal.
Demo01_01:11	{[0105|00960000]}Handed down by gods of old, this power gave its\nholder the means to make any desire a reality.
Demo01_01:10	{[0105|00960000]}Such was the might of the ultimate power that\nthe old ones placed it in the care of the goddess.
Demo01_01:05	{[0105|00960000]}To prevent this great power from falling into\nthe hands of the evil swarming the lands...
Demo01_01:13	{[0105|00960000]}the goddess gathered the surviving humans\non an outcropping of earth.
Demo01_01:12	{[0105|00960000]}She sent it skyward, beyond the reach of the\ndemonic hordes. Beyond even the clouds.
Demo01_01:06	{[0105|00960000]}With the humans safe, the goddess joined forces with the\nland dwellers and fought the evil forces, sealing them away.
Demo01_01:14	{[0105|00960000]}At last, peace was restored to the surface.
Demo01_01:07	{[0105|00640000]}This is a tale that you humans have told for\nmany ages, generation to generation...
Demo01_01:16	{[0105|00960000]}But there are other legends, long hidden away from\nmemory, that are intertwined with this tale.

Demo04_01:38	I'm glad to see my {color[0000]}Loftwing {color[ffff]}got you out\nof bed.\n\n\n{[0104|001e]}{[0106|ffcd]}I was pretty sure you'd sleep in and\nforget to meet me this morning.
Demo04_01:02	But look at this instrument! And look\nat this outfit! They're mine to use today\nin the {color[0000]}ceremony{color[ffff]}, since I'll be playing\nthe role of the goddess.
Demo04_01:03	Aren't they beautiful? Especially this \ninstrument! They tell me it's just like \nthe one the goddess was said to have in\nthe legends.\nIt sounds gorgeous too. I asked {color[0003]}Father\n{color[ffff]}about it, and he says it's called a {color[0003]}harp{color[ffff]}.
Demo04_01:39	And look at these clothes! I made this\nwrap myself, and we get to use it in\ntoday's ceremony!\n\nBetween the harp and this outfit, I'm\ngoing to make a great goddess today!\n\n\nI got you up early this morning because\nI wanted you to be the first to see me\nlike this, {[0104|0014]}{[0200]}!

Demo04_01:05	Hah, I think so too! But it's nice to\nknow you agree. Thanks,\n{[0200]}.
Demo04_01:06	Really{[0106|fecd]}...?{[0106|00cd]} You know{[0106|fecd]}...{[0106|00cd]}maybe it does\nlook a little weird...

Demo04_01:08	Ah, there you are, {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}. Are you all\nprepared for today's ceremony?
Demo04_01:09	Oh, hello, {color[0003]}Father{color[ffff]}.
Demo04_01:10	Ah, {[0200]}, you're here too. \nOutstanding.\n\n\nIt's encouraging to see you up so early,\ngiven your capacity for sleep. No doubt\ntoday's ceremony had you too excited\nto close your eyes for once!
Demo04_01:11	If you win today's ceremonial race,\nyou'll get to participate in the \npostrace ritual with Zelda, so give it\nyour best out there.
Demo04_01:12	Yes. About that{[0106|fecd]}...
Demo04_01:40	Father, I don't know if he can do it!\n\n\n\nRecently {[0200]} hasn't\nbeen practicing much at all\nfor the ceremony!
Demo04_01:41	And even when he's out riding his\nLoftwing, he's just lazily gliding\naround. Probably daydreaming!\n\nI don't know what he's thinking. \nHe's going to have to be in perfect \ncontrol of his bird to win today.
Demo04_01:13	No need to worry yourself, Zelda.\n\n\n\nThough you may have a point. \nToday's {color[0000]}Wing Ceremony {color[ffff]}tests the skill\nof the rider as well as his bond to his\nbird. Victory will not come easily.
Demo04_01:14	And, as you pointed out, I haven't seen\nhim practicing as hard as some of the\nother students.\n\nBut you've known him since you were\nboth very little. You should know \nbetter than to fret about him!\n\nYou see, {[0200]} and his\nLoftwing share a special connection. \nI've never seen anything quite like it.
Demo04_01:15	As you know, each of us in Skyloft is\nbut one half of a pair.\n\n\nWe are only made whole by our\nLoftwings, the {color[0000]}guardian birds {color[ffff]}that \nthe goddess bestows upon each of us\nas a symbol of her divine protection.
Demo04_01:16	When we are young, every one of us \nmeets our Loftwing under the great\nStatue of the Goddess. It's quite a big\nmoment, as I'm sure you recall.
Demo04_01:17	Ahh, but that first meeting between\n{[0200]} and his Loftwing was\nextraordinary.\n\nThe bird that came to him was a\n{color[0000]}Crimson Loftwing{color[ffff]}. It is a breed so rare\nwe were sure for some time that it had\nvanished from the line.
Demo04_01:18	Yes, and the boy and his bird seemed\nto share a profound connection from\nthe moment they met.\n\nDo you recall when {[0200]} \nand that Loftwing of his first met?\nWhat a sight!\n\nThe little boy just hopped up on that\nbird and gracefully flew away, without\neven a moment of instruction!\nThey were meant for each other.\nAnd judging by how jealous you were\nthat day, I'd say the friendship he\nshared with his bird didn't go\nunnoticed by you, my dear.
Demo04_01:43	Ah, but who can blame you? I'm sure\nyou weren't the only one envious of\nthe powerful bond shared by\n{[0200]} and his bird.\nAnyone who is a part of something\nspecial is bound to catch some nasty\nlooks sooner or later, hoo hoo.
Demo04_01:19	This contest is nothing to laugh at,\nFather! This ceremony is part of the\nfinal test for those training to become \nknights of Skyloft!
Demo04_01:20	If {[0200]} doesn't fly fast\nenough during the race... 
Demo04_01:21	What if {[0200]} messes up\nhis big chance{[0106|fecd]}...{[0106|00cd]}{[0104|000f]} What if he's not\nallowed to become a knight?
Demo04_01:22	Calm down, my dear. It will be fine.\n\n\n\nHonestly, it's almost as though you\nbecome a completely different person\nwhen you worry about\n{[0200]}.
Demo04_01:23	Listen, {[0200]}, you'd better\nfly your heart out today. At the very\nleast, you need to squeeze in a little\npractice time before the race!
Demo04_01:24	Come on! You'll thank me later!
Demo04_01:25	Here we are. Go on now. Jump off \nthe edge and call your Loftwing. \nIt's almost time for the ceremony,\nso try to practice seriously for once!\nHmm? {[0104|000f]}Oh yeah?{[0104|000f]} You can't “sense"\nyour bird out there?\n\n\nOh, I get it. You're trying to weasel out\nof having to practice! Nice try, but\nyou're not fooling me.
Demo04_01:26	Off you go!{[0105|001e0000]}
Demo04_01:27	OK, {[0200]}, go ahead!\nJust {color[0004]}press {color[ffff]}{[0204|11cd]} and call your Loftwing!{[0105|003c0000]}
Demo04_01:28	Hmm...{[0104|001e]} His bird sure is taking a long\ntime to get here...{[0105|003c0000]}
Demo04_01:29	Something's wrong!{[0105|001e0000]}
Demo04_01:30	Hang in there, {[0200]}!\nI've got you!{[0105|001e0000]}
Demo04_01:31	Are you two all right?{[0105|003c0000]}
Demo04_01:32	I'm sorry, friend. I didn't mean to push\nyou so hard. You didn't sprain your\nwing, did you?
Demo04_01:33	This is very odd, {[0200]}.\nWhat could have possibly happened to\nyour Loftwing?\n\nFor a bird to ignore the call of his\nmaster... It's unheard of!
Demo04_01:34	And you still can't sense your bird\nnearby, eh, {[0200]}?\n\n\nThis is quite a problem, especially\nconsidering the {color[0000]}Wing Ceremony {color[ffff]}is\nabout to start...
Demo04_01:35	{[0108|00cd]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, when you said you\ncouldn't sense your Loftwing, well...\nI should have believed you.{[0106|fecd]}\n...{[0106|00cd]}I'm sorry.
Demo04_01:36	I need to tend to my own Loftwing, so\nI'll catch up with you later.\n\n\nYou'd better go on ahead and see if you\ncan find where your bird has gone!
Demo04_01:37	My, how did it get to be so late?\nIf I recall correctly, this year \n{color[0003]}Instructor Horwell{color[ffff]} is presiding over \nthe {color[0000]}ceremony{color[ffff]}. \n{[0301]}{[0200]}, you should go\nexplain the situation to him and see if\nhe's willing to delay the race a little\nso that you can find your bird.
Demo04_01:42	But, Father, you're the {color[0000]}headmaster {color[ffff]}of\nthe academy! If {[0200]} asks\n{color[0003]}Instructor Horwell{color[ffff]}, he'll probably\njust come talk to you about it.
Demo04_01:44	Ah, quite true. As usual, you make an\nexcellent point, my dear.\n\n\nVery well, I'll explain the situation\nto him myself. {[0301]}{[0200]}, run\nalong and tell Instructor Horwell\nto come see me in my quarters.
Demo05_01:00	...You know, {color[0003]}Groose{color[ffff]}, that sure was a\npain, what with all the scratching and\npecking.
Demo05_01:01	Course it was. You thought a big\n{color[0000]}Crimson Loftwing{color[ffff]} like that was\ngonna go down without a fight?
Demo05_01:02	But we got him, and I don't care how\ntough those birds are supposed to be.\nHe's not getting out of that pen\nanytime soon, boys.
Demo05_01:03	{[0108|01cd]}Whoa!\n{[0108|00cd]}{[0301]}{[0200]}! So, uh...yeah.\nJust how long you been standing there?
Demo05_01:04	What's your problem, anyway?\nOh, wait...I got it. You're here to talk\nabout today's {color[0000]}race{color[ffff]}. I can see it in those\ndopey eyes of yours.\nThey're pleading, “{[0106|ffcd]}Oh, Groose, can you\nplease find it in your heart to let me\nwin today? Please!"{[0106|00cd]}\n\nYou're just desperate to win so you can\nget some {color[0000]}alone time {color[ffff]}with Zelda up on\nthe {color[0000]}Statue of the Goddess {color[ffff]}at the end of\nthe ceremony.
Demo05_01:05	Well, sorry, pal. Groose doesn't do\ncharity for wimps. My advice? Work\nhard and wish with all your heart.\nYou might even come in second.
Demo05_01:06	{[0106|ffcd]}...Say, come to think of it, how come I\ndon't see your bird?{[0104|000f]}{[0106|00cd]} Where is that\nscruffy pile of red feathers?{[0104|0014]}
Demo05_01:07	I can't imagine what could've happened\nto him. Do you think his tiny brain got\nconfused by all the clouds and got lost?{[0104|001e]}\n{[0100|ffff]}Bring it on.{[0101|ffff]}Give him back!{[0102|ffff]}Nice hair.
Demo05_01:08	Pfft. Sure. Only thing is, I don't know\nhow you're going to do that with no\nbird! You gonna grow wings?
Demo05_01:09	Huh? I've got no idea what you're\ntalking about.
Demo05_01:10	You lay off my do right now, or I'll\nflatten you. Everyone knows I've\ngot the slickest pompadour in town.
Demo05_01:11	You know, we're all getting tired of\nhow you never let anyone forget you\nand Zelda {color[0000]}go way back{color[ffff]}.
Demo05_01:12	You've been friends since you were\nkids? Big deal. It doesn't change the\nfact that you float through life with\nyour head in the clouds.
Demo05_01:13	Would you wake up, straighten up,\nand grow a backbone already?
Demo05_01:14	Dopes like you are dragging our\nhonored academy through the mud.
Demo05_01:15	{[0106|ffcd]}And just who might you be talking\nabout, Groose?
Demo05_01:16	Oh...{[0104|001e]}Zelda. Hey. Nah, it's...uh...\n
Demo05_01:17	Don't even try it, Groose! You're\npicking on {[0200]} again,\naren't you?
Demo05_01:18	He's a student at the academy,\nlike all of us.
Demo05_01:19	Why do you insist on bullying him\naround so much?
Demo05_01:20	{[0106|ffcd]}Yeah... I suppose...
Demo05_01:21	You suppose? Suppose what?
Demo05_01:22	{[0106|fecd]}I...suppose...you... Er...
Demo05_01:23	Pfft! Forget it. I wasn't supposing\nanything, OK?
Demo05_01:24	OK, we're outta here, boys.\nLater, {[0200]}! Hope you\nfind your bird, or else you're gonna\nhave to sit out today's race!
Demo05_01:25	That could be a major setback toward\nknighthood, so find that bird or get\nreal used to the taste of failure! \nIt's your special flavor.
Demo05_01:26	I hate to say it, but I'm beginning to \nsuspect that those blockheads had \nsomething to do with your Loftwing's\ndisappearance.\n{[0301]}{[0200]}, those guys aren't\ngoing to help us find your bird,\nso we'd better start searching.
Demo05_01:27	I'll fly around Skyloft and see if I can\nspot any trace of your bird.
Demo05_01:28	Father said he'd talk to Instructor\nHorwell about delaying the start of the\nWing Ceremony, so don't worry. \nWe'll find your bird in time.
Demo08_01:00	We should hurry, {[0200]}.\nNow that your Loftwing is free, you\nshould fly to the {color[0000]}ceremony{color[ffff]}{[0106|ffcd]}...
Demo08_01:01	But before you go, I have to ask you\nsomething. I{[0106|fecd]}...{[0104|0014]}{[0106|00cd]}I heard this voice a few\nmoments ago. Did you hear it too?
Demo08_01:02	It's been happening a lot lately. It's the\nstrangest feeling... Almost like\nsomeone is calling out to me.
Demo08_01:03	{[0301]}Have you ever wondered what's\nbeneath the clouds?\n\n\nSome say that it's an empty, barren\nplace, or even that there's nothing at\nall down below, but I just have this\nfeeling that they're wrong.\nSome of Father's old texts talk about a\nplace called the {color[0000]}surface{color[ffff]}. The old\ntales describe a whole world under\nthere, far more vast than Skyloft!\nThe thing is, no one's ever been down\nthere to see it, and our Loftwings won't\nfly through the cloud barrier.\n\n{[0106|fecd]}...{[0106|00cd]}But I can't help imagining the wild\nthings that might be waiting below.{[0104|001e]}\nSomeday, I want to see for myself.
Demo08_01:04	Oh, sorry, {[0200]}. We don't\nhave time to talk! Let's get going.\n{[0104|0014]}Look, your bird's waiting for you!\n\nJust leap off the edge and {color[0004]}press {color[ffff]}{[0204|11cd]}.\nDon't worry about falling. Your bird \nwill catch you for sure this time!{[0111|09cd]}
Demo11_01:00	{[0301]}{[0200]}!
Demo11_01:01	Don't worry—I'm fine!
Demo11_01:02	Great flying, {[0200]}!\nCongratulations!
Demo11_01:03	Now we'd better get on with the\nceremony!{[0105|00b40000]}
Demo11_01:04	{[0301]}{[0200]}, hand me that Bird\nStatuette you grabbed in the race.{[0104|000f]}\nI must offer it to the goddess.
Demo11_01:05	Great goddess, guiding light and\nprotector of our people, grant us your\nblessing and mercy as I act in your\nstead during this ceremony.
Demo11_01:06	{color[0002]}Valiant youth{color[ffff]}{color[0002]} who grasped victory at\nthe celebration of the bird folk...\nIn accordance with the old ways...\n\n{color[0002]}I now bestow the blessings of the\ngoddess upon you.{color[0002]}{color[ffff]}
Demo11_01:07	{color[0002]}The blessings of the goddess drift down\nfrom the heavens aloft a sail, which I\nnow pass on to you.{color[ffff]}
Demo11_01:08	You got the {color[0005]}Sailcloth{color[ffff]}!\n\n\n\nNow you can jump from any height without\nfear of a painful landing!\n\n\n{[0108|ffcd]}{[0106|fdcd]}...{[0104|0014]}It smells nice too.{[0104|0014]}
Demo11_01:09	{[0301]}{[0200]}! Quit goofing.\nThis is supposed to be a sacred ritual,\nremember?
Demo11_01:10	You know, they say that the goddess\ngave the Sailcloth to her {color[0000]}chosen hero\n{color[ffff]}long ago.\n\nOf course, the one you're holding isn't\nthe same one. I've been working hard\nto finish making this Sailcloth in time\nto give it to today's champion.\n{[0106|ffcd]}I'm really glad I got to give it to you,\n{[0200]}.{[0104|001e]} {[0106|00cd]}Make sure you\ntake good care of it, OK?
Demo11_01:11	Thanks for making it up here to do this\nwith me today like you promised,\n{[0200]}.
Demo11_01:12	Now we really should finish up this\nritual...{[0105|003c0000]}
Demo11_01:13	{[0106|fecd]}You...{[0104|000f]}do know what happens at the\nend, right?{[0104|001e]} \n\n\n{[0100|ffff]}Nope.{[0101|ffff]}Uh-oh...{[0102|ffff]}Sort of...
Demo11_01:14	Really? Huh. I thought you would've\nfigured it out by now.
Demo11_01:15	And just what are you thinking?\nDon't be silly. This is your big moment,\n{[0200]}.
Demo11_01:16	Heehee, I'm glad you're so well \ninformed on the subject.
Demo11_01:17	You have to jump off the statue!{[0105|003c0000]}
Demo11_01:18	Look down. See that {color[0000]}big{color[ffff]}, {color[0000]}round design{color[ffff]}\non the courtyard below?\n\n\nTo finish the ceremony, you need to\ndrop down right into the center of it!\n\n\nLeap off the edge here. Right before\nyou hit the ground, press {[0204|29cd]} to open up\nyour {color[0005]}Sailcloth{color[ffff]}!{[0111|0fcd]}\n\nJust how brave are you? If you were\nreally fearless, you'd wait until the\nlast second to use your Sailcloth.\n{[0106|fecd]}...So,{[0106|00cd]} ready to jump?
Demo12_01:01	That was perfect! You're amazing,\n{[0200]}!
Demo12_01:02	You know, {[0200]}, seeing as\nhow you won today...
Demo12_01:03	And with the weather being so nice...
Demo12_01:04	You think maybe you'd like to, {[0104|000f]}you\nknow, go fly around the clouds\ntogether?
Demo12_02:01	{[0108|01cd]}...{[0301]}{[0200]}?\nHey, {[0200]}!
Demo12_02:02	Today was amazing. Watching you win\nthe race and performing the ritual\ntogether... I'll always remember this.
Demo12_02:03	It really was wonderful.
Demo12_02:04	You know... {[0200]}...
Demo12_02:05	There's something I've been meaning to\ntalk to you about...
Demo12_02:06	What is that?
Demo12_02:07	What's going on?
Demo12_02:08	Ahhh! {[0301]}{[0200]}!{[0105|002d0000]}
Demo13_01:01	{[0112|0000000d]}{[0301]}{[0200]}...?
Demo13_01:02	I am waiting for you.\n\n\n\nThe time has come for you to awaken.\n\n\n\nYou are vital to a mission of great\nimportance.
Demo13_01:03	{[0112|0000000d]}{[0301]}{[0200]}...
Demo14_01:01	...Ah, you're awake.
Demo14_01:02	When your Loftwing carried you back,\nyou were limp and unconscious.\nI feared the worst.\n\nFortunately, you don't appear to have\nany serious injuries. For that much\nwe can be grateful.
Demo14_01:03	But, {[0200]}...\nWhere's Zelda? She was with you,\nwas she not?\n\n{[0104|000f]}{[0106|ffcd]}...{[0104|000f]}What's happened to my daughter?
Demo14_01:04	A black tornado, you say? Hmm.\nThat was no ordinary storm.
Demo14_01:05	You must not push yourself.\nYou're still recovering.\n\n\nTell me, when you saw Zelda today,{[0104|0014]}\ndid anything about her seem...off?
Demo14_01:06	I see. She was talking about the\n{color[0000]}surface {color[ffff]}then?\n\n\nAnd you've been having dreams about\na “great mission"? How interesting...
Demo14_01:07	I'm sorry. I was lost in thought there\nfor a moment. It's all very strange, but\nI doubt there's much of a connection\nbetween these things.\nI'm concerned for Zelda, but so long\nas she's with her Loftwing, I'm sure\nshe'll be fine.\n\nEither way, daybreak has yet to arrive.\nIt would be very difficult to spot one\ngirl and her bird in the dark of night.\nIt would also be very dangerous.
Demo14_01:09	Rest now, {[0200]}.\nZelda's going to be fine. She's out\nthere alive. I know it.
Demo15_01:01	The one chosen by my creator.\nI have been waiting for you.\nYou will play a role in a great destiny.
Demo15_01:02	According to your social customs,\nI should provide you with my personal\ndesignation. {color[0003]}Fi{color[ffff]} is the name I was given.\n\nI was created for a single purpose,\nlong before the recorded memory of \nyour people.\n\nI must aid you in fulfilling the great\ndestiny that is your burden to carry.
Demo15_01:03	Come, {[0200]}.\nYou must take up this sword. As the\none chosen by my creator, it is your\ndestiny.
Demo15_01:04	The strange dreams troubling your\nsleep.{[0104|000f]} My sudden appearance.{[0104|000f]}\nUncertainty surrounding the fate of\none you hold dear.{[0104|000f]}\nUnder the circumstances, it is only\nlogical that you would exhibit some \napprehension.
Demo15_01:05	To minimize your uncertainty, allow\nme to share some information.\n\n\nMy projections indicate that this\ninformation has a high probability of\naltering your current emotional state.
Demo15_01:06	The one you seek, honorable {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]},\nis still alive.
Demo15_01:07	And this spirit maiden{[0106|fecd]}...{[0104|000f]}{[0106|00cd]}the one you\ncall Zelda...is another chosen one fated\nto be part of the same great mission.\n\nTherefore, should you wish to meet\nwith your friend, I highly recommend\nyou take up this sword before you\nset out to search for her.
Demo15_01:08	Does that information invigorate you?\nAre you ready to accept this sword?
Demo15_01:09	It seems that further persuasive\nmeasures will not be required.\n\n\nIn the name of my creator, draw the\nsword and raise it skyward.
Demo15_02:01	Recognition complete, {[0104|000f]}{[0112|00000001]}Master...\n\n\n\n{[0301]}{[0200]}... {[0104|000f]}{[0106|fecd]}My {[0112|00000004]}master.
Demo15_02:02	{[0301]}{[0200]}!
Demo15_02:03	I've had my suspicions, but until now I\nwasn't sure.\n\n\nYet here we are in the{color[0000]} Chamber of the\nSword{color[ffff]}, the very place where it was\nforetold the youth of legend would one\nday appear.
Demo15_02:04	It is said that this place was left to our\npeople by the goddess herself.\n\n\nThe very knowledge of this room's\nexistence is a secret passed down to a \nselect few each generation, along with\na handful of words...
Demo15_02:05	{color[0002]}When the light of the goddess's sword\nshines bright, the great apocalypse\nwill wake from its long slumber.\n\n{color[0002]}Do not fear, for it is then that a youth,\nguided by my hand, shall reveal himself\nin a place most sacred.{color[0002]}{color[ffff]}
Demo15_02:06	It started days ago. The sword that I've\nkept secret all these years... It began to\ngive off a faint, otherworldly light.
Demo15_02:07	At first I was sure I was seeing things,\nhere alone with the sword. There was\nsimply no other explanation.\n\nI never dreamed the prophecy of\nlegend would come to pass in my\nlifetime.
Demo15_02:08	The words I have sworn to keep secret\nare coming true before my very eyes.\n\n\n{color[0002]}The youth will be guided by one born\nof the blade—one who is also youthful \nin likeness yet wise with knowledge\nimmeasurable.{color[ffff]}
Demo15_02:09	Ah yes, the oral tradition, one of the\nleast reliable methods of information\nretention and transmission.\n\nIt appears that critical sections of the\npassage have been lost over the\ngenerations.
Demo15_02:10	{color[0002]}The youth who draws forth the guiding\nsword shall be known as the goddess's\nchosen hero, and it is he who possesses\nan unbreakable spirit.\n{color[0002]}He shall be burdened with the task of\nabolishing the shadow of apocalypse\nfrom the land. Such is his destiny.{color[0002]}\n\n{color[0002]}With the spirit of the blade at his side,\nhe shall soar over the clouds and\nplummet below...{color[0002]}\n\n{color[0002]}...And united with the spirit maiden,\nshall bring forth a piercing light that\nresurrects the land.{color[0002]}{color[ffff]}
Demo15_02:11	Some of Father's old texts talk about a\nplace called the {color[0000]}surface{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nThe old tales describe a whole world\nbelow, far more vast than Skyloft!
Demo15_02:12	{[0112|00000001]}Master, you must embark on a great\njourney beneath the clouds to the vast\nrealm of the {color[0000]}surface{color[ffff]}.\n\nIt is only through this journey that you\ncan fulfill the mission set before you\nby my creator, the goddess.\n\nIt is also the only method available for\nyou to reunite with the spirit maiden,\nhonorable Zelda.
Demo15_02:13	This is no easy task, {[0200]}.\nThe world below is a forsaken place,\nand to reach it you must pierce the \ncloud barrier below.\nIn living memory, no one has ever\ndone this.
Demo15_02:14	This tablet will illuminate a path\nthrough the clouds to the land below.\n\n\nTake it, and place it within the altar\nbehind me.
Demo15_02:15	You got the {color[0005]}Emerald Tablet{color[ffff]}!\nThe weathered surface of this heavy stone\ntablet feels very old.
Demo15_02:16	{[0112|00000001]}Master, the first thing you must\ndo is hit the crest sitting in this\nroom with a {color[0000]}Skyward Strike{color[ffff]}.\n\nThese blasts are formed of pure energy\nthat charges within your blade when\nyou lift it skyward.\n\nOnce you have charged your blade,\nface the crest and swing your sword\nto send out a powerful Skyward Strike.
Demo15_03:01	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, it is done.
Demo15_03:02	Until now, a {color[0000]}cloud {color[ffff]}{color[0000]}barrier {color[ffff]}created by\nthe goddess has separated the world\nyou know from the one below.\n\nThe tablet you placed in the altar has\nopened a small rift in the barrier.\nYou can use it to travel through the\nclouds to the realm below.\n{[0112|00000002]}I have recognized you as my master,\nand so it is my duty to follow you\nwherever you may go.\n\n{[0112|00000002]}I reside within your sword and will\naccompany you in your travels. \n{color[0004]}Press {color[ffff]}{[0204|11cd]} to summon me whenever you\nrequire my assistance.{[0111|09cd]}
Demo15_03:03	{[0301]}{[0200]}, listen a moment.\nThe nature of the great apocalypse \nmentioned in the old texts is a complete\nmystery to me.\nBut whatever it turns out to be, it \nseems that both you and Zelda have big\nroles to play in the destiny of this land.\n\nJust think—if what this Fi says is true,\nZelda is alive! Alive and no doubt\ncoming to terms with whatever it is the\ngoddess has in store for her.\nShould you heed the call of destiny,\nI don't know what dangers you may\nhave to face, {[0200]}.\nEspecially down there...\nBut if you've decided to brave the\nunknown, please find my daughter and\nbring her back to me.
Demo15_03:04	What we've seen here today defies\nexplanation, but it is only the start of\nyour journey. Please, see it through\nand prove the legends true.\n{[0100|ffff]}OK!{[0101|ffff]}No way.{[0102|ffff]}It's so much...
Demo15_03:05	You do your people proud,\n{[0200]}!
Demo15_03:06	I understand how you feel, but this is \ndestiny itself calling for you. You must\nnot run from it, {[0200]}!
Demo15_03:07	Ah... I'm sorry, {[0200]}.\nI know it's a heavy load to shoulder,\nbut you're the only one who can bear\nits weight.
Demo15_03:08	Dawn is drawing near. It has been a\nlong night for the both of us, hasn't it?\n\n\nYou have a great journey before you,\n{[0200]}, and those clothes...\nThey don't look up to the task.\n\nThe uniform you were to receive for\nwinning the race should be ready\nby now.\n\nA sturdy uniform like that will prove\nmuch more suitable for a long journey.\nYou'd better change before you go.
Demo15_04:01	That green uniform is what our knights\nwill be wearing this year. To be honest,\nI've had my doubts about the color.\n\nBut oddly enough, seeing you wear this\nuniform, I can't imagine a more fitting\ncolor for you. It's as though you were\nborn to wear it.
Demo15_04:02	Take care on your journey, and be sure\nto stop by some of the shops at the\nbazaar here in town to equip yourself\nproperly for the travels ahead.\nI will return to my quarters and see if\nI can glean more useful information\nfrom the ancient texts.\n\nYou are always welcome to stop by if\nyou have questions. You and Zelda \nshall be in my prayers. May the \ngoddess watch over and guide you both.
Demo44_01:01	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, I have\nimportant information.\n\n\nWhen you struck the crest with a \nSkyward Strike from your sword, a \nmessage from the {color[0003]}goddess {color[ffff]}awakened \ndeep within my memory.\n{[0112|00000001]}The goddess intended this message for\nyou, Master. These are her words.
Demo44_01:02	{color[0002]}He who seeks the {color[0003]}sacred flames{color[0002]}, listen\nwell, for I guide you from my place at\nthe edge of time.{color[ffff]}
Demo44_01:03	{color[0002]}The {color[0003]}sacred flames {color[0002]}are three in number.\nTo obtain them, you must also earn\nrelics known as the {color[0003]}three sacred gifts{color[0002]}.\n\n{color[0002]}For each {color[0000]}trial{color[0002]} you overcome, you shall\nbe blessed with one of the gifts...{color[0002]}{color[ffff]}
Demo44_01:04	{color[0002]}Make use of the power of these gifts,\nand you will find your way to the \npurifying {color[0003]}sacred flames{color[0002]}.\n\n{color[0002]}Now, I bestow unto you a melody.\nIt will serve you as a key, opening the\nfirst trial that awaits you deep in the\nwilds of {color[0002]}{color[0000]}Faron Woods{color[0002]}.{color[ffff]}
Demo44_01:05	That song is called {color[0003]}Farore's Courage{color[ffff]}.\n{[0112|00000001]}Its rousing melody will guide you.
Demo44_01:09	You learned {color[0005]}Farore's Courage{color[ffff]}!
Demo44_01:10	{[0112|00000001]}Master, you must overcome the {color[0000]}trials\n{color[ffff]}set before you and obtain the three\ngifts to reach the sacred flames.\n\nI have committed Farore's Courage\nto memory. Now you can use your\n{color[0000]}dowsing {color[ffff]}ability to search for the {color[0003]}gate{color[ffff]}\nleading to the first trial you must face.\nI suggest you set out for {color[0003]}Faron Woods\n{color[ffff]}as soon as you are ready.
Demo48_01:01	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, I have\nimportant information.\n\n\nWhen you struck the crest with a \nSkyward Strike from your sword, a \nmessage from the {color[0003]}goddess {color[ffff]}awakened \ndeep within my memory.\n{[0112|00000001]}The goddess intended this message for\nyou, Master. These are her words.
Demo48_01:02	{color[0002]}He who seeks the {color[0003]}sacred flames{color[0002]}, listen\nwell, for I am the one guiding you from\nmy place at the edge of time.{color[ffff]}
Demo48_01:03	{color[0002]}Two{color[ffff]} {color[0002]}{color[0003]}sacred flames{color[0002]} remain. Should you\ndesire to possess them, you must obtain\nthe other {color[0003]}sacred gifts{color[0002]}.\n\n{color[0002]}For each {color[0000]}trial{color[0002]} you overcome, you shall\nbe blessed with another gift.{color[0002]}{color[ffff]}
Demo48_01:04	{color[0002]}Harness the power of these gifts, and\nlet there be no doubt you shall find\nyourself standing before the majesty\nof the {color[0003]}sacred flames{color[0002]}.\n{color[0002]}Now, I give you another melody. It will\nserve as a key to unlocking your next\ntrial, which awaits you within the\nshifting sands of {color[0000]}Lanayru Desert{color[0002]}{color[0002]}{color[ffff]}{color[0002]}.{color[ffff]}
Demo48_01:05	The song you just heard is called\n{color[0003]}Nayru's Wisdom{color[ffff]}. {[0112|00000001]}Use this song of\nknowledge to find the next trial.
Demo48_01:06	You learned {color[0005]}Nayru's Wisdom{color[ffff]}!
Demo48_01:07	I have memorized Nayru's Wisdom for\nyou. You can now use {color[0000]}dowsing {color[ffff]}to\nlocate the {color[0003]}gate {color[ffff]}to the next trial.\n\nYou should set a course for {color[0003]}Lanayru\nDesert {color[ffff]}immediately.
Demo50_01:01	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, I have\nimportant information.\n\n\nWhen you struck the crest with a \nSkyward Strike from your sword, a \nmessage from the {color[0003]}goddess {color[ffff]}awakened \ndeep within my memory.\n{[0112|00000001]}The goddess intended this message\nfor you, Master. These are her words.
Demo50_01:02	{color[0002]}He who seeks the {color[0003]}sacred flames{color[0002]}, listen\nwell, for I am the one guiding you from\nmy place at the edge of time.{color[ffff]}
Demo50_01:03	{color[0002]}The last of the{color[ffff]} {color[0002]}{color[0003]}sacred flames{color[0002]} still\neludes you. To obtain it, you must claim\nanother {color[0003]}sacred {color[0002]}gift.\n\n{color[0002]}For each {color[0000]}trial{color[0002]} you overcome, you shall\nbe blessed with another gift.{color[0002]}{color[ffff]}
Demo50_01:04	{color[0002]}Make use of the power of these gifts,\nand you will most certainly find the\npath to the {color[0003]}sacred flames{color[0002]}.\n\n{color[0002]}Now, I bestow unto you another\nmelody. Let it serve as a key to\nunlocking your final trial. It awaits you\nupon {color[0000]}Eldin Volcano{color[0002]}{color[0002]}{color[ffff]}{color[0002]}.{color[ffff]}
Demo50_01:05	According to my records, that song you\njust heard is called {color[0003]}Din's Power{color[ffff]}.\n{[0112|00000001]}Use this song of might to locate the\nlast trial.
Demo50_01:06	You learned {color[0005]}Din's Power{color[ffff]}!
Demo50_01:07	I have committed Din's Power to my\nmemory. Now you have the ability to\nuse {color[0000]}dowsing {color[ffff]}to locate the {color[0003]}gate {color[ffff]}to the\nfinal trial.\nI suggest you travel to {color[0003]}Eldin Volcano{color[ffff]}.
Demo64_06:01	Bahah! So you've learned all three\nparts of the song from the dragons,\neh? You have done well, young one!
Demo64_06:02	True to my word, I will perform the\nlast part of the song for you. Ahem...
Demo64_06:03	You learned the {color[0005]}final part of the\nSong of the Hero{color[ffff]}{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000f]}.{[0104|0014]}.{[0105|003c0000]}
Demo64_06:04	The {color[0005]}Song of the Hero{color[ffff]} is now complete!
Demo64_06:05	Now that you know the song, I trust you\nknow what to do with it. That old song\nopens a door to a great {color[0003]}trial{color[ffff]}.\n\nShould you succeed in conquering the\nchallenge awaiting you there, I'm \ncertain the path to the {color[0002]}Triforce {color[ffff]}will be\nrevealed to you.
Demo68_01:01	A report, {[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}.\nMy calculations indicate an 85% chance\nthat the structure you uncovered\nhouses the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}.\nGiven this development, I project that\nthe moment for Zelda to fulfill her\ndestiny and bring an end to {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]} is\nclose at hand.
Demo69_01:01	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I believe at this juncture that\na prayer is required. {[0104|000f]}{[0106|ffcd]}The ultimate goal\nwe have traveled so far for is now\nwithin reach.\n{[0106|ffcd]}Focus now, and wish with all your might\nfor the {color[0000]}destruction{color[ffff]} of {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}.

F1_MJ1_01_2	{[0109|0000000e]}{[0108|fecd]}Just play dead... Just play dead, koo-kwee...\nPlay dead... Must think dead...
F1_MJ1_02	{[0109|0000000b]}Huh...? It's gone quiet.
F1_MJ1_02_2	{[0108|01cd]}Kwee-koo! Now there's a green\none! I didn't even know they\ncame in green!
F1_MJ1_02_3	{[0109|0000000f]}Don't hurt me, koo-weep!
F1_MJ1_04	It spotted me again!
F1_MJ1_04_2	{[0108|02cd]}Kweeee!

F1_MJ1_04_4	Huh? You don't want to...eat me?\nKwee... And come to think of it, \nwhy did you fight off all those red\nmonsters?
F1_MJ1_05	{[0109|00000001]}Kee-paleep! I'm {color[0003]}Machi{color[ffff]}. I'm a Kikwi.\nYou seem OK, even though you're \nscary. Thanks for helping me!
F1_MJ1_05_2	{[0109|00000005]}That's weird, kee-koo. A little while\nago I ran into another funny animal\nlike you, but that one was a girl.\n{[0100|ffff]}Who?{[0101|ffff]}Zelda?
F1_MJ1_05_3	{[0109|00000004]}I don't know who she was, but she\nseemed to be in big trouble when I saw\nher. She a friend of yours, kwee?
F1_MJ1_05_4	{[0109|00000004]}What's a Zelda? I don't know who this\ngirl was, koo-kwee, but she was in a\nbunch of trouble when I saw her.
F1_MJ1_05_5	{[0109|0000000a]}A pack of those mean red guys were\nafter her, kwee, but she escaped with\nthe Kikwi {color[0003]}elder{color[ffff]}.
F1_MJ1_06_2	{[0109|00000007]}Kee-paleep... It sounds like you're\nset on finding this friend and the elder.\n\n\nIf you're heading that way anyway, \nkwee, would you mind {color[0000]}telling our elder\nthat I'm safe{color[ffff]}?\n\n{[0109|00000005]}Cheer up, koo-weep! I bet your\nfriend is safe with our elder.
F1_MJ1_06_3	{[0109|0000000d]}You really spooked me, kwee... \nYou keep some very strange company,\nfriend.
F1_MJ1_07	{[0109|00000004]}Tell the elder that I'm safe. I'm sure\nthe girl you're looking for is safe too.\nShe's probably with the elder, kwi-koo!
F1_MJ1_07_2	{[0109|00000007]}It's good to hear the elder is OK!\nI can't believe he was hiding nearby\nall this time, kweee!\n\n{[0109|00000013]}Sorry to hear that girl you're looking\nfor wasn't with him, though.
F1_MJ1_08	{[0109|00000007]}Thanks a ton for finding all my other\nKikwi buddies.\n\n\n{[0109|00000013]}Too bad that girl you've been looking\nfor wasn't with any of my friends.\nI just hope you find her, kwee!
F1_MJ1_10	{[0109|00000007]}Hey! It's me, kwee! Did you find the\ngirl?\n{[0100|ffff]}Who are you?{[0101|ffff]}Not yet...
F1_MJ1_10_2	{[0109|00000013]}What do you mean, who am I? Don't\ntell me you forgot your old buddy\n{color[0003]}Machi{color[ffff]}! Now I'm sad... Koo-kwee...
F1_MJ1_10_3	{[0109|00000013]}Oh. That's too bad. But it sounds like\nyou at least know where you need to\nsearch next to find her, kwee.\nThat's...something, right?
F1_MJ1_10_4	{[0109|00000007]}I'm so glad I've finally been reunited\nwith all my Kikwi friends. It's all\nthanks to you, koo-weep!
F1_MJ1_10_5	{[0109|00000005]}With any luck, hopefully you'll find\nthat girl you've been searching for real\nsoon, koro-koo! Take care, OK?
F1_MJ2_01	Don't eat me! I taste TERRIBLE!\nLet me go, kwee!
F1_MJ2_02	{[0109|00000005]}Huh? The elder was worried about\nme? I'm glad to hear he's safe, kwee!
F1_MJ2_02_2	{[0109|00000005]}Huh? But you don't seem like a\nmonster, koo-weep...\n\n\nA girl with blonde hair, you say?{[0104|000f]}\n{[0109|00000013]}Can't say I saw anyone like that.\nI was lying low this whole time.
F1_MJ2_02_3	{[0109|00000001]}I'm {color[0003]}Oolo{color[ffff]}. If you meet the elder,\ntell him I'm here, kee-paleep!\n\n\n{[0109|0000000f]}I don't know if it's safe yet... I'm going\nto stay here awhile longer and wait\nfor those monsters to go away.
F1_MJ2_02_4	{[0109|00000014]}What WAS that just now, kwee? \nDon't scare me like that!
F1_MJ2_03	{[0109|00000004]}I'm going to stay here for a while.\nIf you see the elder, kwee, would you\ntell him where I am?
F1_MJ2_03_2	{[0109|00000007]}Good to hear the elder is safe, kwee.\nI'm going to stay here for a while,\nthough, and wait until all those\nmonsters are out of here.
F1_MJ2_04	{[0109|00000007]}Thanks for finding all of my friends,\nkoo-weep!\n\n\n{[0109|00000013]}But...it looks like it's still dangerous\nhere in the forest.
F1_MJ3_01	{[0109|00000002]}{[0108|fecd]}Kikwi!
F1_MJ3_01_2	{[0109|0000000b]}You fought off all those red guys.\nSo does that mean that you're...{[0104|000f]}\na good guy?\n\n{[0109|00000013]}See, I've got this problem. My legs\nhave turned to jelly, and I can't get\ndown. Think you could help me, kwee?
F1_MJ3_02	{[0109|00000011]}Ouch! That, uh...was effective.{[0104|001e]}\nAnyway, thanks to you I'm saved,\nkee-paleep!
F1_MJ3_02_2	{[0109|00000005]}Really? The elder was worried about\nme? Well, I'm glad to hear he's safe,\nkwee-koo.
F1_MJ3_02_3	{[0109|00000005]}Huh? A girl? Sorry, kwee, I don't know\nanything about that.\n\n\n{[0109|00000004]}The elder will probably know\nsomething about her, though.
F1_MJ3_02_4	{[0109|00000001]}My name's {color[0003]}Lopsa{color[ffff]}. If you see the elder,\ncan you please tell him where I am?\n{[0109|00000013]}Oh kwee... My legs are still shaking.
F1_MJ3_02_5	{[0109|0000000d]}I thought you were another monster.\nDon't scare me like that, koo-kwee!
F1_MJ3_03	{[0109|00000004]}I'm going to rest here awhile. If you\nsee the elder, let him know I'm here,\nkoo-weep!
F1_MJ3_03_2	{[0109|00000007]}It's a relief to hear the elder is safe.\n\n\n\n{[0109|00000013]}My legs are still shaking, kwee, so I'm \ngoing to stay here for a while.
F1_MJ3_04	{[0109|00000007]}Kee-paleep! Thanks for finding all the\nother Kikwis!\n\n\n{[0109|0000000b]}It looks like this clearing is monster\nfree right now, unlike most of the\nforest, so I'm sticking here for now.
F1_MJ4_01	{[0109|00000013]}I've been discovered! And here I\nthought I had a good hiding place,\nkwee...
F1_MJ4_01_2	{[0109|00000001]}I'm {color[0003]}Erla{color[ffff]}. You won't find another\nKikwi in these woods that's half as\ngood at hiding as I am. Except the\nelder, of course. Kwee!
F1_MJ4_01_3	{[0109|00000005]}You met the elder? And he's OK?\nPhew, glad to hear it, kwee!\n\n\n{[0109|00000014]}If you see him again, would you\nplease tell him I'm here?
F1_MJ4_01_4	{[0109|00000004]}No one hides like the elder. He's a\ntrue master of camouflage. I don't\nknow if you'll ever find him, koo-weep!
F1_MJ4_02	{[0109|00000005]}How did you find me?! I was blending\nin perfectly with my environment,\nkwee...
F1_MJ4_02_2	{[0109|00000014]}I'm impressed you found me, kwee,\nbut you still haven't found the elder,\nright?
F1_MJ4_02_3	{[0109|00000007]}You found him already?! I don't know\nhow you do it, but you sure do have a\nknack for spotting hidden things, kwee!
F1_MJ4_03	{[0109|00000013]}You've found everyone? Wow, you're\npretty serious about searching. Maybe\nyou should rest your eyes, koo-weep.
F1_MJ5_01	{[0109|00000006]}Kweeeee-heee...{[0104|000f]} I am {color[0003]}Bucha{color[ffff]}, the\nKikwi elder.\n\n\nI saw the way you spotted me through\nmy ingenious camouflage. {[0104|000f]}Kweee,\nyou are clearly a master woodsman.\n{[0100|ffff]}Where's Zelda?{[0101|ffff]}Others like you?
F1_MJ5_01_2	{[0109|00000008]}Zelda{[0106|fdcd]}...?{[0104|000f]}\n\n\n\nAh, the girl creature with the blonde\nhair. She looked like one of your kind.\nYes, she was with me, kweeee.\n\n{[0109|0000000c]}But now is not the time for such talk...\nThe woods are full of monsters. I am\nworried about my missing tribe.\n\nKweeee... The shock and worry has\nmade my memories of the girl quite\nhazy...
F1_MJ5_01_3	{[0109|0000000e]}What? You say you've met some of\nmy people, kweee?
F1_MJ5_01_4	{[0109|00000008]}And you're looking for one of your\nlost people as well?\n\n\nHmmm... Yes. At one point during the\nmonster panic here, I did speak with a\nblonde girl of your kind, kweee.\n\n{[0109|0000000c]}But now is not the time for such talk.\nThe forest is full of monsters, and I am\nworried about my missing tribe.\n\nKweee... The shock and worry has\nmade my memories of the girl quite\nhazy...
F1_MJ5_01_5	{[0109|00000006]}Kweee-hee!{[0104|000f]} I am {color[0003]}Bucha{color[ffff]}, the Kikwi\nelder.\n\n\nYou must be a master woodsman if you\nmanaged to spot me through my {[0104|000f]}expert\ncamouflage, kwee.
F1_MJ5_02	{[0109|00000003]}Hmm... So Machi, Oolo, and Lopsa are\nsafe, are they? Oh, but there are still\nmonsters lurking in the forest, so I\ndare not leave this spot, kwee.
F1_MJ5_02_2	{[0109|00000003]}So Machi, Oolo, and Lopsa are safe,\neh? Sadly, {color[0000]}one more {color[ffff]}{color[0000]}Kikwi{color[ffff]} remains\nunaccounted for. Would you mind\nsearching for him to see if he's OK?\n{[0109|00000002]}He likes to hide in grassy areas, so\nsearch any tufts of grass you see...\n\n\nBy the way, I haven't forgotten about\nthe girl you search for. Give me just a\nbit more time, and I'm sure I can recall\nsomething about where she was headed.
F1_MJ5_02_3	{[0109|00000008]}A {color[0000]}single Kikwi{color[ffff]} remains unaccounted\nfor, kweee. Would you mind searching\nfor him to see if he's OK?\n\nHe likes to hide in grassy areas, so you\nhad better thoroughly search any\ngrassy tufts you spot.\n\n{[0109|00000002]}If you can find him for me, I should\nbe able to remember the whereabouts\nof that girl you're looking for, kwee.
F1_MJ5_03	{[0109|00000003]}Hmm... So Machi, Oolo, and Erla are\nsafe, are they? Oh, but there are still\nmonsters lurking in the forest, so I\ndare not leave this spot, kwee.
F1_MJ5_03_2	{[0109|00000003]}Kwee... So Machi, Oolo, and Erla are\nnow safe?\n\n\nSadly, {color[0000]}one more {color[ffff]}{color[0000]}Kikwi{color[ffff]} remains\nunaccounted for. Would you mind\nsearching for him to see if he's OK?\n\n{[0109|00000002]}He likes to climb trees, so I'd suggest\nyou search the treetops for him, kwee.\n\n\nBy the way, I haven't forgotten about\nthe girl you search for. Give me just a\nbit more time, and I'm sure I can recall\nsomething about where she was headed.
F1_MJ5_03_3	{[0109|00000008]}{color[0000]}One more {color[ffff]}{color[0000]}Kikwi{color[ffff]} remains unaccounted\nfor, kweee. Would you mind searching\nfor him to see if he's OK?\n\n{[0109|00000002]}He likes to climb trees, so I'd suggest\nyou search the treetops for him,\nkwee.\n\nBy the way, I haven't forgotten about\nthe girl you search for. Give me just a\nbit more time, and I'm sure I can recall\nsomething about where she was headed.
F1_MJ5_04	{[0109|00000003]}Kweee... So Machi and Oolo are safe,\neh?\n\n\nOh, but there are still monsters lurking\nin the forest, so I dare not leave this\nspot.
F1_MJ5_04_2	{[0109|00000003]}I'm glad to hear that Machi and Oolo\nare safe, kwee, but I still worry about\nthe other Kikwis.\n\n{color[0000]}Two{color[ffff]} Kikwis are still unaccounted for.\nCould I ask you to search the area\nfor them and make sure they are safe?\n\n{[0109|00000008]}Oh, and I believe I remembered\nsomething about the girl you seek.\nShe took off that way, kwee! Or maybe\nit was this way? Oh dear.
F1_MJ5_04_3	{[0109|00000002]}{color[0000]}Two more{color[ffff]} of my tribe are still\nunaccounted for, kwee! Could I ask\nyou to search the area for them\nand make sure they are safe?\nI've been worried about my fellow\nKikwis, but if you could put my fears\nto rest, I might remember something\nabout where the girl you seek went.
F1_MJ5_05	{[0109|00000003]}Kwee... So Machi, Lopsa, and Erla are\nsafe, eh?\n\n\nOh, but there are still monsters lurking\nin the forest. I dare not leave this spot.
F1_MJ5_05_2	{[0109|00000003]}Kwee... So Machi, Lopsa, and Erla are\nsafe, are they? \n\n\nGood news! Oh, but {color[0000]}one last Kikwi{color[ffff]}\nis still unaccounted for. Could I ask\nyou to search the area for him?\n\n{[0109|00000002]}He has quite a talent for disguising\nhimself as a bit of shrubbery, so\nlook for him amongst any big,\nround bushes you may encounter, kwee.\nOn a separate note, I feel like I'm on\nthe verge of remembering something\nabout that girl you're after and where\nshe went. I need just a little more time.

F1_MJ5_06	{[0109|00000003]}Kweee... So Machi and Lopsa are\nsafe, eh?\n\n\nBut it's not safe! There are still\nmonsters lurking in the forest, so\nI dare not leave this spot.

F1_MJ5_07	{[0109|00000003]}Kweee... So Machi and Erla are\nsafe, eh?\n\n\nOh, there are still monsters lurking in\nthe forest. I dare not leave this spot.

F1_MJ5_08	{[0109|00000003]}Kweee... So Machi is safe, eh?\n\n\n\nAhhh, but the monsters! They are still\nlurking in the forest. I don't dare\nleave this spot.
F1_MJ5_08_2	{[0109|00000003]}I'm glad to hear that Machi is safe,\nyes, kwee, but I still worry about the\nother Kikwis.\n\n{color[0000]}Three {color[ffff]}of my tribe are still unaccounted\nfor.

F1_MJ5_09_2	{[0109|00000009]}Kwee hee hee, I feel much less worried\nnow! I believe I just remembered\nwhere that young lady went!
F1_MJ5_09_3	{[0109|00000003]}I think she headed down that way\ntoward the temple, kwee...{[0104|000f]}but be sure\nto take great care if you follow her.\nThat area is crawling with monsters.
F1_MJ5_09_4	{[0109|0000000e]}{[0108|01cd]}Oho! I almost forgot, kwee!\n\n\n\nAs a reward for finding all my fellow\nKikwis, I will give you a precious\nKikwi heirloom.\n\n{[0109|00000008]}Let me just fetch it for you right\nnow, kweee. Pardon me a moment...

F1_MJ5_09_6	{[0109|00000001]}Go on, kwee. Just climb up onto me and\ntake the reward you earned!
F1_MJ5_09_7	{[0109|00000002]}That young girl...Zelda—was that her\nname? Yes...it's all coming back to me.\nShe said she had to travel to the temple\ndeep within these woods, kweee...\nOho! I tried to warn her about how\ndangerous it was there, but the clever\nlittle thing vaulted off my belly and\nran off on her own just the same.
F1_MJ5_09_8	{[0109|00000008]}What's that, kwee? You are also\nsearching for someone who is lost?\n\n\nWell, kwee...now that I think about it,\nI did bump into a young lady earlier. \nShe had blonde hair, that one.
F1_MJ5_10	{[0109|00000002]}No doubt about it, kwee. This Zelda girl\nyou're looking for ran off toward the\ntemple in the Deep Woods.
F1_MJ5_10_2	With a {color[0005]}slingshot{color[ffff]}, a clever young man\nlike you should be able to find a way\nto the temple.\n\n{[0109|00000006]}Go now and find that girl! I'll be\nrooting for you. Kwee hee hee...
F1_MJ5_11	{[0109|00000002]}With that slingshot, kwee, you should\nbe able to find a path into the Deep\nWoods where that temple is.
F1_MJ5_11_2	{[0109|00000008]}To start, why not try shooting that\ncurled-up vine over there?
F1_MJ5_11_3	{[0109|00000008]}To get started, why don't you shoot that\nvine over—{[0104|000f]} Huh?\n\n\nCouldn't wait to shoot it, could you?{[0104|000f]}\nWell, kwee...I suppose that's a good\nthing. It will make my explanation\nthat much easier to understand.
F1_MJ5_11_4	{[0109|00000002]}Hold {[0204|29cd]} to ready your slingshot, kwee,\nthen release {[0204|29cd]} to let a shot fly.{[0111|0fcd]}\n\n\nIf you run out of ammunition, just \n{color[0004]}grab some seeds{color[ffff]} from the fruit that\ngrows on the trees over there.
F1_MJ5_11_5	{[0109|00000006]}Now go find that girl! I'll be rooting\nfor you. Kwee heh heh.
F1_SWORD_00	{[0105|004b0000]}{[0112|00000001]}Master, you have entered {color[0003]}Faron Woods{color[ffff]}.
F1_SWORD_00_2	{[0105|004b0000]}The plentiful water in this region\nclearly sustains a large diversity\nof flora, including this massive tree.
F1_SWORD_00_3	{[0105|004b0000]}It is logical that the lush plant life and\nwater resources have attracted animal\nspecies to the region.
F1_SWORD_00_4	{[0105|004b0000]}Looking at the probabilities, it is\nextremely likely that Zelda is\nsomewhere in the area.\n\n{[0105|004b0000]}I recommend you continue to use your\ndowsing ability to search for her.
F1_SWORD_01	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I picked up a highly interesting\nspike in {color[0000]}dowsing readings{color[ffff]} from the\ncreature you just encountered.\n{[0100|ffff]}Really?{[0101|ffff]}Zelda?
F1_SWORD_01_2	{[0112|00000005]}Yes, Master. Based on the creature's\ncharacteristics, I must conclude that it\nis a peaceful, forest-dwelling animal\nknown as a {color[0003]}Kikwi{color[ffff]}.\nKikwis are intelligent beings capable of\nspeech{[0104|000f]}. However, such a creature could\nobviously not be confused with Zelda.\n\nIt is unclear why such a creature would\nelicit a dowsing response attuned to\nZelda. You should follow the creature\nand investigate this phenomenon.
F1_SWORD_01_3	The probability of this life-form being\nZelda is 5%, so I must conclude that \nthis is, in fact, not Zelda but a peaceful\nforest creature known as a Kikwi.\nKikwis are highly intelligent beings, \ncapable of speech.{[0104|000f]} Yes, upon further\nobservation...clearly not Zelda.\n\nIt is unclear why such a creature would\nelicit a dowsing response attuned to\nZelda. You should follow the creature\nand investigate this phenomenon.
F1_SWORD_02	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I recommend you investigate\nthe well-being of the creature curled\nup on the forest floor.
F1_SWORD_02_2	{[0112|00000001]}Master, if you do not inquire into the\nhealth of the creature curled up here,\nit has less than a 5% chance of survival.
F1_SWORD_04	I have detected an exceptionally strong\ndowsing response in this area. You\nshould continue searching the vicinity.
F1_SWORD_05	I detect no monsters in the immediate\narea and therefore conclude it is\nsafe for the Kikwi to leave its perch.\n\nIt seems that this Kikwi is unable to\ndescend the tree. I suggest you\nfind a way to expedite his dismount.\n\n{[0112|00000001]}If you find yourself lacking ideas,\nyou can always press {[0204|13cd]} to review your\navailable actions.{[0111|0bcd]}
F1_SWORD_06	I do not detect a strong dowsing\nresponse corresponding with Zelda in\nthis area. It would be best to move\nyour search to another location.
F1_SWORD_06_2	An analysis of dowsing readings\nindicates that there are no additional\nKikwis in this area.\n\nI suggest you speak with the Kikwi\nelder.
F1_SWORD_06_3	Master, I highly suggest you save the\nprogress of your quest before you set\nout for the temple deep within the\nwoods in pursuit of Zelda.
F1_SWORD_06_4	This area commands an excellent view\nof your surroundings. It would be wise\nto utilize this vantage point to dowse\nfor nearby Kikwis.
F1_SWORD_08	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, now would\nbe an excellent time to arm you with\nadditional information regarding the\nuse of your items.\nYou should be aware that you can\ninstantly ready the {color[0005]}slingshot {color[ffff]}you used a\nmoment ago by {color[0004]}quickly tapping {color[ffff]}{[0204|29cd]}.{[0111|0fcd]}\n\nShould you forget this procedure, you\nmay press {[0204|25cd]} to view the {color[0000]}Help{color[ffff]} and be\nreminded.{[0111|0bcd]}
F1_SWORD_09	{[0112|00000004]}Master, my calculations indicate\nthere is an 80% probability that a\nsacred flame lies beyond this gate.\n\nI have also deduced that the power of\nthe goddess the Kikwi hermit referred\nto is in fact the {color[0000]}Skyward Strike{color[ffff]}.\n\nCharge your sword while standing in\nfront of the gate and use its energy to\n{color[0004]}draw the missing portion of the symbol{color[ffff]}.
F1_SWORD_09_2	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, you should\nbe aware that I have calculated an\n80% probability that a sacred flame\nlies beyond this lake.
F1_SWORD_10	{[0112|00000004]}Master, we have obtained new\ninformation on Zelda's current status.\n\n\nThis information indicates that she was\nassailed by monsters but somehow\nevaded capture. However, I infer that\nshe is still in significant danger.
F1_SWORD_10_2	{[010b|00000004]}I have marked the position of the\nKikwi known as Machi. Please\nconfirm your current location.
F1_SWORD_10_3	Furthermore, my analysis suggests that\nthis Kikwi most likely produces a\nfalse-positive dowsing reaction due to\nprevious direct contact with Zelda.\nUsing this hypothesis, I theorize there\nis an 85% chance that the Kikwi elder\nwill also generate a dowsing reaction\nfor the same reason.\nI propose you continue dowsing to\nsearch for Zelda.
F1_SWORD_11	Learning that Zelda is no longer with\nthe Kikwi elder is an unfortunate\nsetback.{[0104|000f]} But he may still have useful\ninformation.\nTaking this into account, I calculate\nan 85% probability that your quest\nwill be aided if you find the lost Kikwis\nfor the elder.\nTo expedite your search for these\nforest-dwelling creatures, I have\nadded {[010b|00000004]}{color[0000]}Kikwis{color[ffff]} as a dowsing option.
F1_SWORD_11_2	Do you need me to explain how to\nswitch dowsing targets? \n{[0100|ffff]}Yes!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
F1_SWORD_11_3	Press and hold {[0204|10cd]} to display the targets\nyou are currently able to dowse for.{[0111|08cd]}\n\n\nSelect your target, and release {[0204|10cd]} to\nconfirm your selection.{[0111|08cd]}\n\n\nIf you do not want to dowse for\nanything, {color[0004]}look around {color[ffff]}and release {[0204|10cd]}.\n{[0100|ffff]}Again, please?{[0101|0000]}Got it.
F1_SWORD_11_4	Additionally, I will mark any Kikwis\nyou discover on your map and disable\ndowsing readings for them. That way,\nyou will not revisit the same Kikwis.\nThis concludes my explanation. When\nready, please begin your search for\nthe missing Kikwis.
F1_SWORD_12	I have marked{[010b|00000004]} the location of Oolo\nthe Kikwi on your map. However,\ndowsing readings indicate there are\nstill Kikwis to search for.
F1_SWORD_12_2	I have marked {[010b|00000004]} the location of Oolo\nthe Kikwi on your map. Unfortunately,\nZelda is not with him.
F1_SWORD_13	I have marked{[010b|00000004]} the location of Lopsa\nthe Kikwi on your map. However,\ndowsing readings indicate there are\nstill Kikwis to search for.
F1_SWORD_13_2	I have marked{[010b|00000004]} the location of Lopsa\nthe Kikwi on your map. Unfortunately,\nZelda is not with him.
F1_SWORD_14	I have marked{[010b|00000004]} the location of Erla\nthe Kikwi on your map. However,\ndowsing readings indicate there are\nstill Kikwis to search for.
F1_SWORD_14_2	I have marked{[010b|00000004]} the location of Erla\nthe Kikwi on your map. Unfortunately,\nZelda is not with him.
F1_SWORD_15	I am not detecting any additional\ndowsing responses in the area.\n\n\nI suggest you go speak with the Kikwi\nelder.
F1_SWORD_16	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, I have\ndetected {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}'s aura emanating\nfrom within this structure.
F1_SWORD_16_2	However, I have also detected the\npresence of numerous monsters.\nAre you sure you want to proceed?\n{[0100|ffff]}Of course!{[0101|ffff]}No.
F1_SWORD_16_3	It would be very unwise to display\noverconfidence here. Within the walls\nof this place, no one will come to\nyour aid.
F1_SWORD_16_4	Do not feel embarrassed. Fear is a\nnatural self-preservation instinct\ncommon among living creatures.
F1_SWORD_16_5	If you feel unprepared to face the\ndangers ahead, consider {color[0004]}returning to\nthe sky{color[ffff]} to properly equip yourself.
F1_SWORD_16_6	{[0112|00000001]}Master, it appears you do not currently\nhave a {color[0000]}shield{color[ffff]} equipped. To reduce the\nprobability of extreme bodily harm,\nI recommend carrying one at all times.
F1_SWORD_16_7	It would be wise to carry a {color[0000]}shield {color[ffff]}to\nprotect yourself, as well as a stock of\n{color[0000]}potions {color[ffff]}to restore lost hearts.
F1_SWORD_16_8	Now we should continue the search for\nZelda.
F1_SWORD_17	I have confirmed the plant life of this\narea matches that of Faron Woods.\nWe have reached the area locally\nreferred to as the Deep Woods.\nNow we should continue toward the \ntemple in search of Zelda.
F1_SWORD_18	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, should\nyou have questions about anything,\nI encourage you to call me with {[0204|11cd]}.{[0111|09cd]}\n\nOnce I'm summoned, select {color[0000]}Advice{color[ffff]} and\nthen {color[0000]}Hint {color[ffff]}and I will promptly offer you\ninformation pertinent to your current\ncircumstance.
F1_SWORD_19	{[0112|00000004]}Master, I am also capable of providing\nan analysis of your current battle-\nperformance rating versus each enemy\ntype you've encountered.
F1_SWORD_19_2	While {color[0004]}targeting{color[ffff]} an enemy with {[0204|07cd]},\npress {[0204|11cd]} to summon me. I will provide\ninformation on your enemy as well as\nyour battle-performance rating.{[0111|07cd]}{[0111|09cd]}
F1_GORON_00	{[0109|00000001]}Now, there is a face I know. Hey, bud!
F1_GORON_00_2	{[0109|00000001]}Now, there is a face I know! Hey, bud!\n\n\n\nI got something I need your help with.\nCome over here and take a look!
F1_GORON_00_3	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, bud, come over here and give a\nGoron a hand, will you?
F1_GORON_01	{[0109|00171908]}I tell you, your timing could not have\nbeen better.\n\n\nLook here. I stumbled onto one of\nthese things just now, and it looks just\nlike something I have seen in those\nancient texts!
F1_GORON_02	{[0109|00ffff05]}If I remember right...{[0104|000f]} Yup, this is one\nof the things the goddess was said to\nhave left behind for the hero of legend.\n\nPretty amazing, right? I even thought\nup a name for these things.{[0104|001e]} I have been\ncalling them {color[0003]}Goddess Cubes{color[ffff]}!\nMakes sense, right?
F1_GORON_03	{[0109|00001e04]}Those ancient texts say some real\ninteresting stuff about these things.\nHow did it go again? Let me see, uh...\n\n“Summon forth the light from a\nheavenly blade{[0104|001e]}, and may that sword's\nmaster receive aid."{[0104|001e]} So there you\nhave it.
F1_GORON_04	{[0109|0018170b]}I see you got yourself a sword there.\nWhat do you say we try and crack the\nmystery of this cube together?\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure!{[0101|ffff]}Nah.
F1_GORON_04_2	{[0109|00171908]}Hey! Thanks a billion, bud!
F1_GORON_04_3	{[0109|0018170c]}Aww, come on, I am begging you here!\nHelp me out?\n{[0100|ffff]}OK.{[0101|ffff]}Nope.
F1_GORON_04_4	{[0109|00080007]}OK, I get the picture. I will make sure\nthis is worth your while.
F1_GORON_04_5	{[0109|00171906]}You would have to be crazy to refuse\nme now! Unless you are... You are not\ncrazy, are you?
F1_GORON_05	{[0109|00ffff00]}This cube is made of some sort of\nmetal I have never seen. I have whaled\non it, but nothing happens.
F1_GORON_05_2	{[0109|00160b07]}You know, bud, I would say the key to\ncracking this egg is that one line.\nYou know, {[0109|00001705]}“{color[0000]}the light from a\nheavenly blade{color[ffff]}"?
F1_GORON_06	{[0109|00151908]}WHOOOA! Did you see that?! The cube\njust shot up into the sky!\n\n\n{[0109|00131b00]}I think it reacted to that whirly-beam\nthing that shot out of your sword.\n\n\n{[0109|00001b05]}And where do you think the cube shot\noff to, anyhow? This mystery just got a\nwhole lot more, uh, mysterious!\n\n{[0109|00161e00]}The texts say there are cubes like that\none all over this land.\n\n\n{[0109|00001700]}Tell you what. You blast as many of\nthose cubes as you can find. If you find\nout more about them along the way,\nyou come see me.
F1_GORON_07	{[0109|00181705]}Hmm? What is up, bud? You got a\nquestion? \n{[0100|ffff]}Cubes?{[0101|ffff]}Temple?{[0102|0000]}Not really.
F1_GORON_07_2	{[0109|00161e04]}Yeah, hit those cubes with a blast of\nlight from your sword and WHOOSH...\nThey shoot up into the sky.\n\nThe ancient texts I have read say those\ncubes are all over this land.
F1_GORON_07_3	{[0109|00080b04]}The old texts refer to a place near here\ncalled Skyview Temple where, as the\nstory goes, a visitor from the sky will\none day be received.
F1_GORON_07_4	{[0109|00001707]}Come to think of it, I seem to\nremember seeing an old stone marker\nsomewhere in these parts.\n\n{[0109|00160b00]}I do not remember exactly what was\nwritten on the thing,{[0104|000f]} but my gut tells\nme it is the key to getting inside!
F1_GORON_08	{[0109|00000002]}{[0108|02cd]}Hey, do not run off!\n\n\n\nI need your help figuring out the secret\nof these Goddess Cubes.
F1_GORON_08_2	{[0109|00000002]}{[0108|02cd]}Hold up, bud!\n\n\n\nI need to ask you a favor.
F1_GORON_09	{[0109|00000003]}{[0108|02cd]}Hold it, bud!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00170600]}Do not walk on by like you do not see\nme when I know you do.{[0104|000f]} Are you mad\nat me or something?\n{[0100|ffff]}Sorry!{[0101|ffff]}I don't like you.
F1_GORON_09_2	{[0109|00161e07]}Oh, you are busy searching for your\nfriend. I get it. Sorry to get in your\nway, bud. Really, I am.\n\nBut this will not take long. Come help\nme out, will you?
F1_GORON_09_3	{[0109|00161e56]}Oh. Ouch. Is that so? I guess it is just\nhow it is for us explorer types. We are\nfated to be misunderstood.\n\nJust the same, could you take a few\nminutes to help me out?
F1_SEKIBAN_03	He who descended from above:\nlook to the star that the bird\nrising heavenward gazes upon,\nand aim your shot there.

TELOP_D100_01	Skyview Temple
FR_D1_ST_01	In a room with two glittering\ngemstones, you shall find a\ntemple map.\n\nGaze upon that map until your\neye finds the {[0204|19cd]}, for it is there\nthat you must strike another\ngemstone to reveal a path.
FR_D1_ST_02	He who descended from the sky:\nlend your ear to the wise voice\nof the servant who brought you\nto the firm soil.
FR_D1_ST_03	Two doors lead to rooms left and\nright, but they will only open\nwhen the gemstones are struck.\nOne is above, one below.
FR_D1_SW_01	I detect Zelda's aura! There is a high\nprobability that she is beyond this\nlarge door.
FR_D1_SW_03	The mechanism controlling the lock on\nthis door appears to have been\ndeactivated.
FR_D1_SW_04	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I have bad news. The auras of\nmany creatures reverberate\nthroughout this temple.\n\nAs a result, I can't isolate Zelda's aura{[0106|fecd]}.\n{[0104|000f]}You will {color[0000]}not be able to track her{color[ffff]} here.\n\n\n{[0112|00000001]}Given the situation, I suggest you\n{color[0004]}look around {color[ffff]}to see where we should\nmove next.
FR_D1_SW_05	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, I have\ninformation concerning the\nmechanisms that open the doors.\n\nGiven their function, logic dictates\nthat the mechanisms are positioned\nnear the doors that they open.\n\nThere is an 80% probability you will\nlocate these mechanisms if you\nthoroughly explore and {color[0004]}look around\n{color[ffff]}in every direction.
FR_D1_SW_06	It appears one of Ghirahim's \nunderlings has reengaged the lock\nhere. You will need to search the\narea for the key once again.
FR_D1_SW_07	You have acquired a new item.\nAnalysis of this object's insect-like\nprofile and wings indicates {[010b|00000004]}it can {color[0000]}fly{color[ffff]}.\n\nAfter launching it, you can {color[0000]}remotely{color[ffff]} {color[0000]}pilot\n{color[ffff]}the device. The sharp structure on the\nfront of the device can sever threads\nand deliver a blow to smaller objects.\nPress {[0204|29cd]} to ready the device for takeoff,\nand press {[0204|25cd]} to learn more about its\noperation.{[0111|0fcd]}{[0111|0bcd]}
FR_D1_SW_08	I am detecting a greater enemy\npresence in the vicinity than I\npreviously observed. You would be\nwise to proceed with caution.
FR_D1_SW_08_2	My readings indicate the presence\nof {color[0005]}sacred water {color[ffff]}within the temple.\nUnfortunately, it is{color[0000]} not possible to\nuse your {[010b|00000004]}dowsing{color[ffff]} ability here.\nBased on my calculations, I estimate\nthe water is located in the deepest\npart of the temple complex.
FR_D1_SW_08_3	I recommend using the {[0204|19cd]} on your\nmap as a guide when revisiting the\ndeepest area of the temple.
FR_D1_SW_09	I detect {color[0000]}sacred water{color[ffff]} nearby. There\nare no monster auras causing\ninterference, so you can {color[0000]}dowse {color[ffff]}here.
FR_D1_SW_10	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, it is likely\nthat I am the servant this tablet is\nreferring to.\n\nTo help you{[0112|00000002]} with your mission, the\ngoddess gave me a massive quantity\nof knowledge about this land.\n\nShould you find yourself in need of\nanswers, I hope you won't hesitate to\ncall on me by pressing {[0204|11cd]}.\n{[0111|09cd]}\nIf you {color[0004]}target {color[ffff]}an object with {[0204|07cd]} and\nthen {color[0000]}press {color[ffff]}{[0204|11cd]}, I will tell you all the\ninformation I know about it.{[0111|07cd]}{[0111|09cd]}
FR_D1_SW_11	The sentries you see here are born of\nevil magic. They have a tendency to fix\ntheir gaze on any pointed object that\nmoves within their view. 
FR_D1_SW_11_2	This set of sentries is bound together.\nThis allows them to resist being rotated\nindependently of one another.
FR_D1_SW_12	{[0112|00000004]}Master, I detect targetable objects in\nyour immediate vicinity.\n\n\nIf you press {[0204|11cd]} while {color[0004]}targeting{color[ffff]} a\nperson or object with {[0204|07cd]}, I will provide\nyou with information on that subject.{[0111|07cd]}{[0111|09cd]}
FR_D1_SW_13	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, the water\nin this room is...{[0104|000f]}{color[0000]}ordinary water{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nThe {color[0005]}sacred water {color[ffff]}that the Water\nDragon seeks is likely located in \nthe deepest part of the temple.
FR_D1_MG_01	Just fantastic. I work like a weasel\njust to swipe a key from that monster,\nand then I hafta go and lose it.
FR_D1_MG_02	I just can't remember which hole\nI hid it in.
FR_D1_MG_02_2	Eh, what do I need a key for, anyway?\nI can buy a trunk full of those things\nonce I find the treasure I'm after!
FR_D1_MG_02_3	Aww...and here I thought that key\nwould be my ticket to a life of luxury.{[0104|000f]}\nI could have sworn I {color[0000]}buried it right\naround here{color[ffff]}...
FR_D1_MG_03	Hey. What do you want?\n{[0100|ffff]}Key?{[0101|ffff]}Treasure?{[0102|0000]}Never mind.
FR_D1_MG_03_2	Huh? I can't find it anywhere...
FR_D1_MG_03_3	It's the darnedest thing. I buried a key\naround here, but I can't recall where\nexactly I put it.
FR_D1_MG_03_4	You know that big guy? The one who\nlooks like a boulder with legs?\nCraaazy eyebrows too.\n\nSo anyway, he told me about this\n{color[0000]}golden sculpture {color[ffff]}that opens a\ndoor to some fancy place here.
FR_D1_MG_03_5	Now where could I have hidden that\nkey? I guess it might not be this room\nafter all. You don't happen to have a\nmap on you, do you, pal?
FR_D1_MG_03_6	Heyyy, what's with the grin? Ya know\nsomething, don'tcha? Come on.\nSpit it out, kid.
FR_D1_MG_03_7	Say, that's my missing key! You found\nit and brought it back to me!
FR_D1_MG_03_8	What?! Ya found my key and then\nused it already?
FR_D1_MG_03_9	Hmm. I was just thinkin', what use do\nus Mogmas have for keys? We can dig\nour way in and out of anything!
FR_D1_MG_03_10	Well, good to know where that key\nwent. I gotta get back to hunting for\ntreasure. Here's hoping we both\nstrike it rich in here! See ya!
FR_D1_MG_04	Hold it... You're that guy. That guy\nI met in the volcano!
FR_D1_MG_05	Here to do some treasure hunting too?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yep!{[0101|ffff]}Nope.
FR_D1_MG_06	I called it! You got treasure hunter\nwritten all over your face.
FR_D1_MG_06_2	You're a terrible liar, guy. Ya got\ntreasure hunter written all over\nyour face.
FR_D1_MG_07	Did the big stone guy out there tip ya\noff to the loot too?\n{[0100|ffff]}Stone guy?{[0101|ffff]}Tip?
FR_D1_MG_07_2	Yeah, what'd he say again?\n“{[010b|00000004]}{color[0004]}Strum a chord {color[ffff]}most beautiful\nin the place within the temple\nwhere the butterflies dance."
FR_D1_MG_07_3	So I get here, and I let loose with\nsome of the most gorgeous humming\nI've done in my entire life, and\nnothing happens!
FR_D1_MG_07_4	But seeing how I've come this far,\nthere's no chance I'm gonna give\nup the hunt for treasure just yet!
FR_D1_MG_08	Sheesh. I dig some serious miles to\nget my paws on treasure, and I've\nfound squat. Talk about bad luck!
FR_D1_MG_09	I think some no-good thief beat me\nto the goods. There's nuttin' here\nbut {color[0000]}water {color[ffff]}now.
FR_D1_MG_10	Who in the stinkin' world would\ncome all this way for water?\nNobody, that's who.
FR_D1_MG_11	I'm cuttin' my losses and headin' home.\nSee ya!
FR_D1_MG_12	Whoa there, buddy. I bet you think\nyou're going to run ahead and swipe\nall the best treasure for yourself.
FR_D1_MG_12_2	But I say you're setting yourself\nup for big-time disappointment.{[0104|001e]}\n\n\nJust 'cause some weird design popped\nup on the wall doesn't mean you're any\ncloser to finding treasure, all right?
FR_D1_MG_12_3	I think you've been had by that\nboulder with legs!
FR_D1_MG_12_4	Stay here if ya want. I'm going on\nahead!
FR_D1_MG_12_5	No one's beatin' me to all the sweet\nloot piled up in this place!
FR_BOSSEND_00	Well...{[0104|000f]} You put up more of a fight than\nI would have thought possible out of\nsuch a soft boy.\n\nBut don't clap for yourself quite yet.\n{[0104|000f]}That sword of yours is the only reason\nyou still live.
FR_BOSSEND_01	I fear I spent far too long teasing and\ntoying with you.\n\n\nThe girl's presence has all but faded\nfrom this place, which means there's\nno reason to linger here.\n\nGood-bye, sky child. Run and play this\ntime. Get in my way again, though,\nand you're dead.
FR_BOSS_BATTLE	{[0105|004b0000]}Hah, quite the sword you have here.{[0104|000f]}\nBut so long as {color[0000]}you telegraph your\nattacks {color[ffff]}like the novice you are,\nyou'll never land a blow.
FR_BOSS_SW_02	{[0112|00000004]}Master, as I just translated, it would\nappear that {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} purified herself in\nthe waters of this spring.\n\nI calculate a 97% chance that she has\nalready set out for {color[0003]}Eldin{color[ffff]}, where\nanother great spring exists.\n\nHowever, it is not clear what method of\ntravel Zelda used to move from here\nto her next destination.
FR_BOSS_SW_02_2	My analysis suggests you should take\nthe tablet to the altar in Skyloft.\n\n\nDoing so will likely open a new {[010b|00000004]}{color[0000]}column\nof light {color[ffff]}on the surface, allowing you to\ndescend to another area and continue\nyour search for Zelda.
FR_BOSS_SW_03	Let's return to the sky once more\nbefore continuing our search. The {color[0003]}bird\nstatue{color[ffff]} outside can take us back up.
FR_BOSS_SW_03_2	The bird statue that transports you\nback to the sky should be in the forest\nyou previously passed through.
FR_WATER_SW_01	There is a 95% probability that the\nwater here is identical to the water\nwithin the Water Dragon's basin.\nI suggest we take it back to her.
FR_WATER_SW_01_2	My analysis of the water here reveals\nan extraordinarily high concentration\nof energy.\n\nThere is a strong likelihood that this\nenergy will be amplified upon contact\nwith an object of conforming\nwavelength.

TELOP_D101_01	Ancient Cistern
FR_D2_01	Strike the {color[0000]}gemstones pointing in\nfour directions {color[ffff]}wisely. The way\nwill only open for one who knows\nthe temple's {color[0000]}secret order{color[ffff]}.
FR_D2_05	Carved into the {color[0000]}great statue\n{color[ffff]}are inscriptions of gratitude.\nThey reveal the {color[0000]}secret order {color[ffff]}of\nthis temple.\nFirst the {color[0000]}back{color[ffff]}, then the {color[0000]}rear{color[ffff]},\nthen the {color[0000]}back of the right hand{color[ffff]},\nand finally the {color[0000]}back of the left\nhand{color[ffff]}.
FR_D2_02	Return the stone giant to its\noriginal form, and descend\nbelow the earth again along\nthe thread.\nThere you will find the {color[0005]}key {color[ffff]}to\nthe path ahead.
FR_D2_03	Look for the {color[0005]}key {color[ffff]}that lies\nbeneath the earth.
FR_D2_04	A gemstone shines deep within\nthe eye. Strike it to shut the\nmouth and dam the flow.
FR_D2_11	Based on the patterns we have seen\nso far, I believe the {color[0005]}key {color[ffff]}mentioned on\nthe stone marker is the {color[0005]}key {color[ffff]}required\nto unlock the device ahead of us.
FR_D2_13	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I have some important\ninformation that I am certain\nyou will want to hear. There is a\nlarge treasure chest in the area.\nThere is an 85% probability it\ncontains the {color[0005]}key {color[ffff]}that will open the \ndoor we observed at the top of the\nstone statue.
FR_D2_14	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I have taken the liberty to\nconfirm that a door is located at\nthe uppermost section of this statue.\nThe lock is unfamiliar to me.
FR_D2_30_01	You certainly are persistent.{[0104|0005]}.{[0104|0005]}.
FR_D2_30_02	I'm terribly busy trying to find the\nclues that will help me revive the\ndemon king.
FR_D2_30_03	Your incessant buzzing around my\nhead like some irksome gadfly\nwhen I'm THIS busy is... Well, it's\nmaking me very disagreeable.

FR_F2_MJ0_01_3	{[0109|00010004]}Hmmmmmm? Oh, you again...kwwrk.\nIs there something I can do for you?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes.{[0101|0000]}No.

FR_F2_MJ0_01_5	{[0109|00000007]}Ah, you're playing in {color[0000]}Hero Mode{color[ffff]}. That\nexplains it. In that case, you don't need\nme blabbing on about what you need to\ndo, do you?{[0100|ffff]}Pretty much.{[0101|ffff]}Uh, I forgot...
FR_F2_MJ0_01_6	{[0109|00000003]}Huh, maybe so. Maybe so. This must be\nwhat folks call déjà vu, kwwwrk.\nCreepy.
FR_F2_MJ0_01_7	{[0109|00000003]}Uh-oh. If your memory is so shaky that\nyou've already forgotten our past\nconversation, things could get pretty\nhairy for you this time around, kwwrk!
FR_F2_MJ0_02	{[0109|00000007]}Is that so? Well then, slap yourself on\nthe back, kwwwrk! You know, some\nKikwis can't even see me these days.

FR_F2_MJ0_02_3	{[0109|00030006]}...But forget all that nonsense and tell\nme, kwwwrk, what business does a\nreal live human have in these woods?\n\n{[0100|ffff]}The flame!{[0101|ffff]}Nothing.
FR_F2_MJ0_03	{[0109|00010001]}You're out questing for a flame to\nenhance your sword, kwwrk? So that\nyou can find someone important to\nyou, eh?\nHow about that...{[0104|000f]} A human who can see\nme and seeks a great flame, kwwwrk!

FR_F2_MJ0_03_4	{[0109|00030008]}All right, I'll tell you. But remember—\nit's a secret to everybody.
FR_F2_MJ0_03_5	{[0109|00030014]}{[0108|02cd]}You can't keep a secret?!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00010006]}Here I am trying to let you in on a big\nsecret, and you can't even promise to\nkeep it to yourself? Do you even want\nto hear it, kwwwwwrk?\n{[0100|ffff]}Please!{[0101|ffff]}Nah...

FR_F2_MJ0_04	{[0109|00030004]}The flame that you seek...{[0104|000f]}is most\nlikely {[010b|00000004]}{color[0003]}Farore's Flame{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n{[0109|00010000]}Yes, yes... Farore's Flame...{[0104|000f]} That story\nbegins very long ago, when the goddess\nwas still with us, kwwwrk...
FR_F2_MJ0_04_2	{[0109|00000002]}The goddess gave the flame to the\n{color[0003]}Water Dragon{color[ffff]}, a great spirit that\npresides over {color[0003]}Faron Woods{color[ffff]}.
FR_F2_MJ0_04_3	{[0109|00000004]}The way I hear it is she left the flame\nin the care of the Water Dragon so that\none day the mighty dragon could pass\nit on to the “{color[0003]}one from the sky{color[ffff]}"...
FR_F2_MJ0_04_4	You see, kwwwwrk, I've got a hunch\nthat the goddess was talking about\nyou, lad.\n\n{[0109|00030009]}Well, that settles that. You must\nseek out the mighty Water Dragon.
FR_F2_MJ0_04_5	Her lair is deep in a lake in the south\nof these woods, kwwwwwwrk.\nShe watches over the flame there.
FR_F2_MJ0_05	{[0109|00000004]}There's a problem, though. The gate\nthat leads to that lake is sealed shut to\nall those judged unworthy...\n\n{[0109|00000007]}But don't worry, kwwwwrk. I'll let you\nin on the trick to opening the gate.
FR_F2_MJ0_05_2	{[0109|00010004]}To open the gate,{[0104|000f]} you have to channel\nthe {color[0000]}power of the goddess {color[ffff]}into the\nsymbol carved into its doors, kwwwrk!\n\n{[0109|00000009]}Oh, but it isn't so simple!{[0104|000f]} The symbol is\nincomplete. To unlock the gate,\nyou must make the symbol whole.
FR_F2_MJ0_05_3	{[0109|00030001]}The only way you'll know what the\ncompleted symbol should look like is\nto first find that same completed\nsymbol somewhere else in these woods.
FR_F2_MJ0_05_4	{[0109|00010004]}The gate is down in the south, so it's\nlikely that there's a matching symbol\nsomewhere up north. Try searching\nnear this {[0204|19cd]}, kwwwrk!
FR_F2_MJ0_06	{[0109|00010006]}Is all of this seeping into your head,\nlad? Do you know where you must go\nto find the symbol you seek?\n{[0100|ffff]}Got it!{[0101|0000]}Uh...
FR_F2_MJ0_06_2	{[0109|00000003]}All right, kwwwwrk, let's try that\nagain...
FR_F2_MJ0_06_3	{[0109|00000003]}Channel the power of the goddess\ninto the gate, and complete the symbol\ncarved upon its doors using that power.
FR_F2_MJ0_06_4	{[0109|00000009]}Place a beacon on your map over\nthis {[0204|19cd]} so that you can find the\nlocation I was talking about, kwwwrk!
FR_F2_MJ0_07	{[0109|00030007]}Then I wish you safe travels, lad.
FR_F2_MJ0_07_2	{[0109|00000013]}I'll be here nappin' if you need some\nof my elder wisdom. See you around!\nKwwwwwwrk...
FR_F2_MJ0_08	{[0109|0003000f]}I forgot to mention this earlier, but\nit's important.{[0104|000f]} Her Excellence, the\nWater Dragon, is VERY persnickety\nabout manners... So watch yours!\n{[0109|00010000]}I've heard stories of folks who caught\nher in a fussy mood. {[0109|0000000b]}They ended up as\nmidmorning snacks, kwwwwrk!
FR_F2_MJ0_08_2	{[0109|00010000]}I probably taste like old cave moss,\nbut I'm not in a hurry to become a\nroyal meal, kwwwrk!\n\n{[0109|00030006]}So don't let her know I told you about\nFarore's Flame, OK?\n\n\n{[0109|00030007]}And remember, when you're in her\nhall, you'd better be on your best\nbehavior and be a gracious guest.

FR_F2_MJ0_09	{[0109|00010001]}There's no need to be so rough,\nyou know.\n\n\n{[0109|00010006]}Hmm? You need to fetch some sacred\nwater to prove yourself to the\nWater Dragon?\n\nDid you try searching the temple here?\nI think I remember Her Excellence\nwas quite fond of the water from one\nof the little springs inside.
FR_F2_MJ0_09_2	{[0109|00010001]}There's no need to be so rough,\nyou know.\n\n\n{[0109|00010007]}Ah, no mistaking it. That's the water\nHer Excellence craves. If you're\nembarrassed to give it to her, you\ncould always say it's a gift from me!
FR_F2_MJ0_09_3	{[0109|00010001]}Hey now! You're going to give me\na bruise like that.\n\n\n{[0109|00010007]}So you've managed to open the gate\nto Lake Floria, eh?\n\n\nRemember, if the Water Dragon\nasks how you found out where she\nresides, you didn't hear it from me!
FR_F2_MJ0_10	{[0109|00010001]}Ack! That stings!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00010007]}I hear the Water Dragon's pretty\nimpressed with you.\n\n\nOf course, she's been impressed with\nme for ages now, so...
FR_F2_MJ0_11	{[0109|00010014]}You! I told you to keep quiet about\nour conversation!\n\n\nWhen the Water Dragon flooded the\nforest, I was sure she was going to\neat me like a dinner salad!\n\n{[0109|00010007]}Still, the flood isn't so bad, is it?\nThe water's flushed out most of those\nmonsters. The woods are quite\npeaceful, really.
FR_F2_MJ1_01	{[0109|00000001]}Heya! Remember me? You ever find\nthat girl you were searching after?\n{[0100|ffff]}Who're you?{[0101|ffff]}Not yet...
FR_F2_MJ1_01_2	{[0109|00110013]}Who am I...?{[0104|001e]} Is it that hard to\nremember who I am?\n\n\n{[0109|000b0004]}Want to know the best way to tell us\nKikwis apart? If you point to us on\nyour map, you'll see our names appear.
FR_F2_MJ1_01_3	{[0109|00110013]}Oh... I sure hope you two find each\nother soon. Let me tell you, there's\nnothing like reuniting with friends.
FR_F2_MJ1_02	{[0109|00000007]}I'm sure glad all those mean guys\nare gone. We can finally live in\npeace again!\n\n{[0109|00000004]}I really hope you find your friend,\njust so the two of you can get back\nto life as usual!
FR_F2_MJ2_01	{[0109|0009000c]}How long do we have to live in\nconstant fear?\n\n\n{[0109|00070013]}Is no place in the woods completely\nsafe? One day it would be nice to\ngo for a relaxing walk.
FR_F2_MJ2_02	{[0109|0009000c]}Everyone keeps saying the forest\nis safe again, but I don't buy it.\n\n\n{[0109|00070013]}I mean, is anywhere truly safe\nanymore? One day, I'd like to go for\na walk without cringing with fear\nevery time I hear a sound.
FR_F2_MJ3_01	{[0109|00000007]}This is where we've made our home.\nThere's plenty of food to go around. \nIt's a pretty nice place, all in all.
FR_F2_MJ3_02	{[0109|00000004]}I love that it's so safe here, but you\nknow...it's kind of boring now.\n\n\n{[0109|00110005]}I should really stop complaining and\njust enjoy this “problem" of mine.
FR_F2_MJ4_01	{[0109|00000014]}You may not have noticed, but I'm\ntrying to hide here. Could you please\nscoot along before you draw monsters\nover this way?
FR_F2_MJ4_02	{[0109|00110013]}You found me again. Sheesh, there's\njust no hiding from those eagle eyes\nof yours.\n\n{[0109|000b0007]}You know, I think you deserve a\nreward. Here—take this. I found it\nwhile I was hiding.
FR_F2_MJ4_03	{[0109|00000014]}Don't forget: it's a secret to everybody!
FR_F2_MJ4_04	{[0109|00000013]}Hiding from you isn't even fun. You're\ntoo good at finding me.
FR_F2_MJ4_05	{[0109|00000004]}It's nice to get lost in your own\nthoughts sometimes.\n\n\n{[0109|00000001]}Sitting down for a quick break does\nwonders for the body and the mind.
FR_F2_MJ5_00	{[0109|00000003]}I see that you didn't find the girl in the\nDeep Woods, kee-paleep.\n\n\n{[0109|00000002]}But you can't lose heart! Just as I have\nbeen reunited with my fellow Kikwis,\nyou will find your friend one day, kwii!
FR_F2_MJ5_01	{[0109|0000000e]}Ah, hello again. I see you have the\nWater Dragon's Scale there,\nkewwww.\n\n{[0109|00000002]}That's amazing! I heard that if you\nhave one, kewww, you can swim\nthrough the water like a dragon soars\nthrough the sky!
FR_F2_MJ5_02	{[0109|00000003]}There must be places here in the woods\nthat you haven't visited yet, kewww.\n\n\n{[0109|00000008]}You should use the Water Dragon's\nScale to explore areas you couldn't\neven get to before, kewww!
FR_F2_MJ5_02_2	{[0109|00000003]}There are still some parts of this forest\nthat you haven't discovered yet,\nkewwwww.\n\n{[0109|00000008]}If you use the power of the Water\nDragon's Scale, you can dive\nunderwater, kewww. Just hold {[0204|00cd]}\non the water's surface.
FR_F2_MJ5_03	{[0109|00000006]}Hoo-hoo-hoo.
FR_F2_MJ5_04	{[0109|0000000e]}You found a way inside the great\ntree, eh? Hah, impressive!
FR_F2_MJ5_05	{[0109|00000002]}If you reach the top branches of the\ntree, the view is spectacular!\nYou never know what you might\nsee from up there.
FR_F2_MJ5_06	{[0109|0000000e]}So you climbed your way to the\nvery top of the tree? Very impressive!\n\n\n{[0109|00000008]}What's that? Someone's living up\nthere? Well, I'm counting on you to\nfind out more about this mystery tree\nresident.
FR_F2_MJ5_07	{[0109|0000000e]}What's that? You met an old hermit\nKikwi living up in the tree? Amazing!\nAll this time I was sure there were only\nfive of our kind in these woods!
FR_F2_MJ5_08	{[0109|00000002]}What a wild world we live in. I hope\nI can meet our lost brother soon.
FR_F2_MJ5_09	{[0109|0000000e]}So you've met Her Excellence, the\nWater Dragon? What an experience!\nI am terribly envious of you.
FR_F2_MJ5_10	{[0109|0000000e]}So the Water Dragon has found you\nworthy, has she? You are full of\nsurprises.
FR_F2_MJ5_11	{[0109|00000002]}I confess that now that the water has\nreceded, I do miss it a bit. It was\nexciting to have a change of scenery.
FR_F2_MJ5_12	{[0109|00000008]}Speaking of a change of scenery, how \nis Oolo faring out there in the big,\nwide world? Is he well?
FR_F2_MJ5_13	{[0109|00000008]}By the by, did you hear about Oolo?\nHe's considering leaving the woods on\nhis own. That's one brave Kikwi...
FR_F2_SW_01	You have reached the top of the tree.\n\n\n\nFrom this vantage point, you have a\ngood view of the woods. Perhaps you\nwill see an area you haven't explored.
FR_F2_SW_01_2	{[0112|00000001]}Master, look up there...
FR_F2_SW_01_3	I have confirmed the discovery of\na new Kikwi.\n\n\nAnalysis indicates a 90% chance that\nthe sounds we have been hearing were\nthe loud snores of this Kikwi.
FR_F2_SW_03	I am analyzing the water remaining in\nthis basin.{[0106|fccd]}.{[0104|000f]}.{[0106|00cd]}{[010b|00000004]} Excellent. I can now help\nyou {color[0000]}dowse {color[ffff]}for the water type you are\nsearching for.
FR_F2_SW_03_2	{[0112|00000001]}Master, you do not have a container\nsuitable for transporting water. Please\nprepare a vessel for this purpose.
FR_F2_SW_03_3	{[0112|00000001]}Master, you have wisely elected to\ncarry an {color[0005]}Empty Bottle{color[ffff]}. Use it to carry\nthe water you seek.
FR_F2_SW_04	I am analyzing the water in this basin{[0106|fccd]}...{[0104|000f]}{[0106|00cd]}\nIts unique {color[0000]}properties {color[ffff]}{color[0000]}match {color[ffff]}the water\nyou collected at Skyview Spring.
FR_F2_SW_05	I estimate an 80% probability that this\nsymbol is the one the hermit was\ndescribing.
FR_F2_SW_05_2	I recommend you memorize its shape.
FR_F2_SW_06	Congratulations, {[0112|00000004]}\nMaster {[0200]}.
FR_F2_SW_06_2	You have passed this trial. You now\nhave the power to proceed to the\nlocation of the first sacred flame\nthat will enhance your sword.
FR_F2_SW_06_3	The {color[0005]}{[0201|0044]}{color[ffff]} is one\nof the goddess's sacred gifts.\n\n\nThe great spirit of the {color[0003]}Water Dragon\n{color[ffff]}has provided you with the ability to\nswim freely underwater.
FR_F2_SW_06_4	The flame you seek is somewhere \nwithin these woods... {[0112|00000001]}Master, I must\nconclude that this flame is likely in a\npart of this area you have not explored.
FR_F2_SW_07	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I have information to report.\n\n\n\nBy my estimates, you are currently\nsituated in the southwest area of\nFaron Woods. Please confirm your\nlocation with your map.
FR_F2_SW_08	Yes, as I suspected, the water level in\nFaron Woods has dropped. The forest\nhas returned to its former less-\naquatic state.
FR_F2_SW_09	{[0112|00000001]}Master, listen closely.\nDo you hear that?
FR_F2_SW_11	Measurements indicate a large amount\nof water in this {color[0001]}basin{color[ffff]}. This quantity of\nwater has an 85% chance of putting out\nthe flames that block our path.\nI recommend you attempt to borrow\nthis basin{[010b|00000004]} from the Water Dragon.
FR_F2_SW_12	Were you to transport this {color[0001]}basin {color[ffff]}to the\nvolcano, the water in this container has\nan 85% chance of extinguishing the\nflames barring your path.\nI recommend you attempt to borrow\nthis basin{[010b|00000004]} from the Water Dragon.
FR_F2_SW_13	To transport the Water Dragon's basin\nto the volcano, you will need to enlist\nthe service of that transport robot.\nShall I send word to him?\n{[0100|ffff]}Call him!{[0101|ffff]}Not that guy...
FR_F2_SW_13_1	Very well,{[0104|000f]} shall I call for the robot?\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure!{[0101|ffff]}Not that guy...
FR_F2_SW_14	Understood, {[0112|00000005]}Master. I will call him\nat once.
FR_F2_SW_15	{[0112|00000001]}Master...{[0104|000f]}unless you plan to carry the\ntub on your back, now is not the\ntime to be picky about who will help\nyou. I will call for the robot.
FR_F2_SW_15_1	{[0112|00000001]}Master...{[0104|000f]}despite your somewhat\nwarranted reservations, it would be\nirrational to abandon the most logical\nsolution. I will call for the robot now.
FR_F2_SW_16	{[0112|00000001]}Master, your task here is complete for\nthe moment. We should return to the\nsky so that we can set a course for\nthe volcano.
FR_F2_DR_00	{[0109|0000000f]}Hmm...
FR_F2_DR_00_2	{[0109|00000001]}{[0108|02cd]}Ah! You there, human!
FR_F2_DR_01	{[0109|0000000f]}You have intruded into my home,\na sacred place few are permitted to\nenter!\n\n{[0109|00090700]}This is no place for one such as you.\nAnd yet here you stand! You will\nexplain how you got here, and quickly.\n{[0100|ffff]}Water Dragon?{[0101|ffff]}I'm lost.
FR_F2_DR_01_2	{[0109|00070903]}I am. Those with manners address\nme as Faron, warden of the woods.\nI was appointed by the goddess herself.\n\nThough my current stature is less\nthan, well, intimidating, shall we say,\nknow that you stand in the presence\nof a loyal servant of the goddess!\n{[0109|00090900]}{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}{[0109|00000007]}Hmm?
FR_F2_DR_01_16	{[0109|00090900]}{[0106|fecd]}I say,{[0104|000f]}{[0109|00000006]}{[0106|02cd]} that's one of MY scales you have\nthere!\n\n\n{[0109|00090700]}A sacred gift such as that could only be\ncarried by the goddess's chosen hero.\n{[0109|00000005]}But could you really be him?\n\n{[0109|00070700]}This raises questions. Even with that\nscale in your possession, finding my\nhall is no easy task... How did you\nfind me?
FR_F2_DR_01_3	{[0109|00070704]}Ah, yes...{[0104|001e]} That cackling, old hermit\nKikwi told you where I live, didn't he?\n\n\n{[0109|00090910]}Honestly, I can't remember how many\ntimes I've told that scruffy thing to\nkeep his mouth shut. That's the last\nstraw. Next time I see him, he's dinner!\n{[0109|00070900]}Oh, but I digress.{[0104|001e]} You've come here\nseeking a {color[0000]}sacred flame{color[ffff]}, have you?\n{[0100|ffff]}Of course!{[0101|ffff]}I forget...
FR_F2_DR_01_4	{[0109|00090704]}I knew it.
FR_F2_DR_01_17	{[0109|00090700]}But I'll be straight with you. A shrimpy\nboy like you hardly looks the part of\nthe goddess's chosen hero.\n\n{[0109|00070703]}There's no doubt about it. A test is in\norder to prove you're everything you\nsay you are.\n\nShortly before your arrival, I was\nattacked by a pompous creature calling\nhimself {color[0003]}Ghirahim{color[ffff]}.\n\nI stood against this self-proclaimed\nDemon Lord, but I was wounded in the\nencounter.
FR_F2_DR_01_15	{[0109|0007070f]}The wounds he's given me are stubborn\nthings. I have been forced to\nrecuperate in this basin of {color[0003]}sacred\nwater{color[ffff]}.\n{[0109|00090700]}Unfortunately, the healing properties\nof the sacred water have diminished,\nand I am now in need of another dose\nto freshen up my healing bath.\n{[0109|00090906]}{color[0000]}Bring me the{[010b|00000004]} container of fresh sacred\nwater{color[ffff]} that I require.
FR_F2_DR_01_5	Do me this favor, and I'll gladly show\nyou where to find the sacred flame\nyou desire. What say you?\n{[0100|ffff]}You got it!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
FR_F2_DR_01_6	{[0109|00090706]}Excellent. Now run along. One does not\nkeep a dragon waiting.
FR_F2_DR_01_7	{[0109|00090910]}Do not mock me, boy!\n\n\n\nLinger in my hall a moment longer,\nand I'll bite your head clean off!
FR_F2_DR_01_8	{[0109|00090706]}I am willing to lead you to the sacred\nflame you seek, but only if you bring\nme the {color[0003]}sacred water{color[ffff]} I seek.\n{[0100|ffff]}All right.{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
FR_F2_DR_01_9	{[0109|00070706]}Quickly now, bring me the sacred water\nI desire. Do so, and I will show you\nthe way to the sacred flame.
FR_F2_DR_01_10	{[0109|00070709]}Yes! Just look at that color. There's\nno doubt this is the water I need.\nQuickly, boy, pour it into my basin!
FR_F2_DR_01_11	{[0109|00090704]}Hmph. So it's too great a task for you?\nThen I guess you are a mere human\nafter all.
FR_F2_DR_01_12	{[0109|00090910]}{[0108|01cd]}Do not mock me, boy! If this is\nan attempt at humor, you will\nfind this a cold audience!\n\n{[0109|00010900]}Still...few mortals have had the\ncourage to speak so boldly before me.\nYou do not intimidate easily. Yes,\na laudable trait to be sure.
FR_F2_DR_01_13	{[0109|00000005]}If you continue down this way, you will\nfind an exit back to the woods.
FR_F2_DR_01_14	{[0109|00090707]}What's this? You have a bottle of the\n{color[0003]}sacred water{color[ffff]} I seek here with you?\nGo on and pour it into my basin!
FR_F2_DR_02	{[0109|00090900]}Mmmmmm! Exquisite! I can feel its\nenergy surging through me!
FR_F2_DR_02_2	Behold the full majesty of {color[0003]}Faron{color[ffff]},\nWater Dragon and guardian of these\nlands! I stand tall—healed and whole\nonce again!
FR_F2_DR_02_3	{[0109|00090700]}Human. You have done well to bring\nme the {color[0003]}sacred water{color[ffff]} I asked you for.\n\n\nI see now it was no coincidence that\nyou completed the goddess's trial\nand obtained a {color[0003]}Water Dragon's Scale{color[ffff]}.
FR_F2_DR_02_8	{[0109|00090700]}Human. You have done well to bring\nme the {color[0003]}sacred water{color[ffff]} I asked you for.\n\n\nI see now it was no coincidence that\nyou completed the goddess's trial\nand obtained a {color[0003]}Water Dragon's Scale{color[ffff]}.
FR_F2_DR_02_4	{[0109|00070700]}In turn, I will grant you the favor you\nhave asked of me and lead you to the\n{color[0000]}sacred flame{color[ffff]} of my land.\n\nCome.
FR_F2_DR_02_5	{[0109|0007070f]}One day I shall also repay Ghirahim in\nfull for his actions here.
FR_F2_DR_02_6	{[0109|00070702]}That is a great sword you carry.\nDevote yourself to growing into a man\nstrong enough to wield its might.
FR_F2_DR_02_7	{[0109|00070702]}It pleases me that you have driven so\nmany monsters from these woods.\nYou have finally grown to possess\nstrength worthy of the sword you bear.\n{[0109|00070704]}When you first came to my hall, you\nseemed an uncertain little thing...{[0104|001e]}\nBut now your confidence is written\nacross your face.\n{[0109|00070706]}Just the same, continue to temper your\nbody and mind! You must, if you hope\nto carry out the divine task entrusted\nto you.
FR_F2_DR_03	{[0109|00070705]}Now...behold.
FR_F2_DR_03_2	{[0109|00000300]}{[0105|003c0000]}{[0108|01cd]}Hah-hmm{[0106|fccd]}...
FR_F2_DR_03_4	{[0109|00000006]}Go. The sacred flame you seek lies\nwithin this place.\n\n\nWhile the waterfall has barred\nentrance to this place for many\nyears, monsters have still found a\nway in...and inside they flourish.
FR_F2_DR_03_5	{[0109|00070704]}Ah, but you are the goddess's chosen\nhero. Swatting a few monsters will be\nno trouble for you.\n\nI imagine you and I will cross paths\nagain. Until then, do not lower your\nguard.\n\n{[0109|00070703]}Farewell, boy.
FR_F2_DR_04_0	{[0109|00000006]}Ah, it's you. Tell me, are you mastering\nthe power that dwells within your\nsword?\n\n{[0109|00070707]}Oh? You wish to borrow my {color[0000]}water\nbasin{color[ffff]}?{[0104|001e]} {[0109|00000005]}Hmm...{[0104|000f]} Very well. I have\nrecovered, and I have no intention of\nhaving to soak in it again soon!\n{[0109|00070706]}Begone with it. It's yours to use as\nyou please.
FR_F2_DR_04_1	{[0109|00070707]}Hmm? You wish to borrow my {color[0000]}water\nbasin {color[ffff]}once again?\n\n\n{[0104|001e]}{[0109|00000005]}Hmm...{[0104|000f]}very well. But I must say the\nannoying contraption that returned\nwith it last time had a wicked tongue\non him!\n{[0109|00070706]}I let it go because he's in your service,\nbut if you don't teach that impudent\nrunt some manners, know that I will.
FR_F2_DR_04_2	{[0109|00070702]}Return the basin to me when you finish\nwith it. There is no rush, though.\nIt's yours to do with as you please.
FR_F2_DR_05	{[0109|00070702]}Ah, the sword you carry is different\nsince I last saw you. Yes, I see it is \nmuch improved...
FR_F2_DR_05_2	To think, the goddess's chosen hero is\nbut a mere boy. Quite a twist...
FR_F2_DR_05_3	{[0109|00070700]}Chosen hero or not, you do not yet\npossess the strength required to wield\nthe full power of that blade.
FR_F2_DR_05_4	You must train yourself further!\nDevote yourself wholly to this task.
FR_F2_DR_05_5	{[0109|00070700]}Farewell, boy.
FR_F2_DR_06	{[0109|00070707]}Yes? If you have a question for me,\nyou need only speak it.\n{[0100|ffff]}Fire Dragon?{[0101|ffff]}Thunder Dragon?{[0102|ffff]}Faron Woods?{[0103|0000]}Nothing.
FR_F2_DR_06_2	{[0109|00070704]}Hah! Him?{[0104|000f]} Just as I was charged with\nwatching the woods, so does he preside\nover the volcanic lands to the north. \n\nHe's a peculiar fellow who has made\nhis lair deep in the sweltering depths\nof the volcano, beyond the reach of\nmonster and man.\nIf you can't handle the heat, I'd suggest\nyou stay clear. That is, unless you want\nthe flame-charred look!
FR_F2_DR_06_3	{[0109|00070704]}Hah! Oh, him?{[0104|000f]} Just as the goddess\ncharged me with watching the woods,\nso does he preside over the bone-dry\nsands of the desert.\nHe's the oldest of the dragons. For\nsome time, he's neglected his own\nhealth.{[0104|000f]} I wonder how he's been faring\nof late...
FR_F2_DR_06_4	{[0109|00070704]}A great many ancient songs praise the\nway humans once lived in these woods.\nThey were in harmony with nature.\n\nHonestly, I think those songs fail to\nsee the big picture. Don't you agree\nthese woods are far more beautiful\nnow that the humans are gone? 
FR_F2_DR_06_5	{[0109|00070706]}Continue to temper your body and\nmind! This is vital if you are to carry\nout the divine mission entrusted to you!
FR_F2_SJ1_01	Quit following me, pest! If you don't\nmove along, I'll be forced to tell\nHer Excellence the Water Dragon\nabout your little incursion!
FR_F2_SJ1_07	Ack! Another human!\n\n\n\nOK, OK... I just have to avoid eye\ncontact and back away slowly...
FR_F2_SJ1_01_2	Ha-HA! Didn't see that coming,\ndid you? Yep, there's no way you're\ngoing to be able to follow me now!\n\nSo, what now? Are you going to cry?\nIf you think you can make it through,\njust go ahead and try!
FR_F2_SJ1_01_3	Yep, nothing short of a mighty {color[0004]}spin\n{color[ffff]}move will get you through here, and\nyou obviously can't do that!
FR_F2_SJ1_02	GAH! How is that even possible?\nI've never seen a human pull off a\nspin like that!\n\nWait.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]} That's a {color[0003]}Water Dragon's Scale{color[ffff]}!\nDoes that make you the emissary\nof the goddess, like the Water\nDragon said?\nHey, I've got an idea! Maybe you\ncan help Her Excellence! \n{[0100|ffff]}What's wrong?{[0101|ffff]}Take me to her!
FR_F2_SJ1_06	Yeah, about that...{[0104|000f]} It happened really\nrecently. This weirdo came in here\nwith a gang of monsters and went\nright after Her Excellence.\nMy lady the Water Dragon is a fierce\nfighter, and, boy, did she gobble up\nmost of those monsters in the first\nfew seconds.\nThing is, there were just so many of\nthem! While she was distracted, the\nweirdo leading all those creatures\nmanaged to wound her.\nShe's healing up now, but she says we\ndon't have enough special water for her\nto make a full recovery.\n\nSo could you please go talk with Her\nExcellence and see if you can help\nher out?\n\nI'll even take you to her. Follow me!\n\n
FR_F2_SJ1_02_2	Huh? That's weird. I was expecting\nto meet up with my friend here...\nAnd the path is blocked with a\nhuge boulder.\nLovely. Now what do we do?
FR_F2_SJ1_02_3	You see those pointy, bloated fellas\nover there? Sure they look tough, but\nif you {color[0000]}spin{color[ffff]} at 'em, they go down easy.
FR_F2_SJ1_03	Oh, now that's using your noodle!\nHer Excellence is just up ahead.\nOver this way!
FR_F2_SJ1_03_2	Come on, come on! Hurry up!\n\n\n\nHuh? You can't get through? Sheesh,\nyou humans and your bones. Talk about\ninconvenient. I guess you can leap over\nthe top of this wall if you have to.
FR_F2_SJ1_03_3	If you can't pass through here, you'll\njust have to jump over the top of the\nwall.
FR_F2_SJ1_04	Wow! Perfect jump!\n\n\n\nI'd call you amazing, but I think we\nboth know it was the Water Dragon's\nScale that made that little stunt\npossible.
FR_F2_SJ1_04_2	Yikes! Oh, they're back! That's one of\nthe fish that weirdo brought in here\nand used to attack Her Excellence.\n\nWatch out—they're mean as they come!
FR_F2_SJ1_04_3	Hey there, big guy... We're friends,\nright? We both like...water.\nDon't hurt me now...
FR_F2_SJ1_05	Wow! The goddess sure knows how to\npick them! You did great!
FR_F2_SJ1_05_2	At last, we're here!
FR_F2_SJ1_05_3	Her Excellence the Water Dragon is \njust up ahead. Hang on just a second.
FR_F2_SJ1_05_4	Please, come in.
FR_F2_SJ2_01	Her Excellence is just up ahead.\nPlease, go in and speak with her!
FR_F2_SJ2_01_2	Go on! Talk with the Water Dragon!
FR_F2_SJ2_02	Please help Her Excellence recover!
FR_F2_SJ2_02_2	Help her! Help her!
FR_F2_SJ2_03	Thanks to you, the Water Dragon has\nmade a complete recovery.\nMany thanks!
FR_F2_SJ2_03_2	Many thanks!\nMany thanks!
FR_F2_SJ2_04	Her Excellence is currently out\nand about.
FR_F2_SJ2_04_2	Out and about!\nOut and about!
FR_F2_SJ2_05	Talk about bad luck. While the woods\nwere flooded, I had to stay here and\nhold down the fort.\n\nTalk about disappointment! I was\nreally looking forward to swimming\naround that area for once.
FR_F2_SJ2_05_2	Disappointment!\nDisappointment!
FR_F2_SJ3	Eeep! Don't eat me!\n{[0100|ffff]}Your Excellence?{[0101|ffff]}I won't eat you.
FR_F2_SJ3_2	Me, the Water Dragon? No!{[0104|001e]}\nAre you looking for Her Excellence?\n\n\nYou possess one of her scales, so you\nmust be a friend to our kind. I will\ntell you where you can find her.
FR_F2_SJ3_3	The Water Dragon lives just a little\nways up from here. If you want to\nmake a note of that, now's probably\na good time to do it!
FR_F2_SJ3_4	It's a secret to everybody.
FR_F2_SJ3_5	Whaaa?{[0104|000f]} You don't want to gobble\nme up?{[0104|000f]} Oh, that's a relief.\n\n\nI've been hiding here for a while.\nEver since that school of scary-looking\nfish swam through.
FR_F2_SJ3_6	Me, the Water Dragon? No!{[0104|001e]}\nAre you looking for Her Excellence?\n\n\nShe's actually very kind, but if you're\nrude to her...she can be quite scary!\nWhen you see her, make sure you\nstay on her good side.
FR_F2_SJ3_7	The Water Dragon is actually very\nkind...unless you irritate her.\nMake sure you stay on her good side!
FR_F2_SJ3_8	Her Excellence hasn't been herself\nsince the attack. Can't you do\nsomething for her?
FR_F2_SJ3_9	I'm so glad Her Excellence has made\na speedy recovery. Thank you for\ncoming to her aid!
FR_F2_SJ3_10	It's a shame the woods aren't flooded\nanymore. I wish I could have explored\na bit more outside.
FR_F2_60	I never knew there were humans who\ncould dive this deep!\n\n\nCan you also do a {color[0000]}spin{color[ffff]}?
FR_F2_61	Say, Mr. Human Person, do you know\nhow to do a {color[0000]}spin jump{color[ffff]}?\n\n\nIf you spin up {color[0000]}toward the water's\nsurface{color[ffff]}, you can do an amazing leap\nright out of the water!
FR_F2_62	Hah! Human in the water! {[0104|0014]}Look at him\ntrying to flap around in the water!
FR_F2_63	The place was just perfectly peaceful\nfor the longest time. Then weirdo\npeople like you started showing up.\n\nOn top of that, scary fish have been \nterrorizing our water! All this\ncommotion has made it impossible\nfor me to get any shut-eye.
FR_F2_64	That one over there? He's dying to\nget in good with the Water Dragon.\n\n\nMy advice? Keep your distance.\nNothing good will come of hanging\naround with a fin-kissing Parella.
FR_F2_65	I love my home here. I just wish it was\na little easier to get in and out of the\nplace.
FR_F2_SR_00	Mistress Fi, bzzzt! My deep apologies\nfor keeping you waiting!
FR_F2_SR_01	Let's see here... This cargo looks very\nheavy,{[0104|000f]} but it's well within my payload\ntolerances, bzzrrt!
FR_F2_SR_01_1	Ugh, vweep. This old {color[0000]}basin {color[ffff]}again...{[0104|000f]}\nFine, vrrm! I got this...
FR_F2_SR_02	Master Shortpants! Watch carefully\nwhile I demonstrate what a real hero\nlooks like, bzzzzat!
FR_F2_SR_03	As usual, vrrrt, I shall await you in the\nskies above.

FR_F3_MJ1_01	{[0109|00000004]}Koro-koo! {[010b|00000004]}I was so shocked when\nwater started flowing out of the\n{color[0000]}Great Tree's roots{color[ffff]}!\n\n{[0109|00110005]}Kwee... How am I supposed to hide\nwhen the whole forest is underwater?\nI hope things go back to normal soon!
FR_F3_MJ1_02	{[0109|00000001]}I'll teach you something useful.\nSome rocks will roll away if you\nattack them, kwi-koo!
FR_F3_MJ1_02_2	{[0109|00000007]}Yeah, the forest's flooded, ka-roo, but\nI'm holding up! Give my best to the\n{color[0003]}Water Dragon{color[ffff]}!
FR_F3_MJ2_01	{[0109|0009000c]}We're finished, kew! What'll become\nof our forest? It's so...wet.
FR_F3_MJ2_02	{[0109|0009000c]}The {color[0003]}Water Dragon{color[ffff]} flooded the forest?\nKew-aroo! She's probably planning to\neat us all when we're soggy!
FR_F3_MJ2_03	{[0109|0009000c]}I don't care if you go dowsing or\ndiving or what, kwi-koo. Just please\nfind those Tadtones!
FR_F3_MJ2_02_2	{[0109|0009000c]}Oh, when will this water go away?!\nI can't swim, kik-kwoo!
FR_F3_MJ3_01	{[0109|0000000f]}All this started after the {color[0003]}Water Dragon{color[ffff]}\nshowed up, kera-kwoo! This flood must\nbe her fault!
FR_F3_MJ3_02	{[0109|0011000b]}Kik-kwee! If you want to know more\nabout Tadtones, you should talk to the\nParella. They know all about them.\n{[0100|ffff]}Parella?{[0101|0000]}I know.
FR_F3_MJ3_02_2	{[0109|00000007]}Yeah, the forest's flooded, karoo, but\nI'm holding up! Give my regards to the\n{color[0003]}Water Dragon{color[ffff]}!

FR_F3_MJ3_02_4	{[0109|000b0005]}If you run into one in the water, kweek,\nsee what it has to say!
FR_F3_MJ4_01	{[0109|00000004]}Kee-paleep! I saw the {color[0003]}Water Dragon{color[ffff]}!\nShe must be hiding around here\nsomewhere!
FR_F3_MJ4_02	{[0109|00000014]}As you collect Tadtones, kew-kwee,\nyou'll fill in the musical score.\nKeep searching till you find them all!
FR_F3_MJ4_03	{[0109|00000014]}Try dowsing, kwook, and find the\nTadtones!

Come to think of it, I'd\nforgotten to ask your name.\n\n{[0109|00000003]}...{[0104|0019]}I see. {[0301]}{[0200]}, is it?\nNow there's an odd name, kewwwww.\n{[0109|00000000]}Ah...\n\nWhat brings you to see me?\n{[0100|ffff]}This water!{[0101|ffff]}The woods...
FR_F3_MJ5_02	{[0109|0000000e]}Oh, {[0200]}.\n\n\n\n{[0109|00060003]}What's this? The {color[0003]}Water Dragon{color[ffff]} caused\nthis flood? So the old girl finally grew\nangry with all the monsters running\nabout the forest, kewwww?\n{[0109|0001000c]}...The woods won't be getting drier\nanytime soon, kewwww...
FR_F3_MJ5_03	{[0109|0000000e]}Off you go, now! Hurry and return to\nthe {color[0003]}Water Dragon{color[ffff]}!
FR_F3_MJ5_04	{[0109|00000001]}Kewwww... How nice to see you again,\n{[0200]}!\n\n\nHow goes the {color[0003]}Tadtone{color[ffff]} gathering?\nI'd actually thought of something\nyou might be interested to know.\n\n{[0109|00040011]}You see, it's like...hrmm... How\nshould I explain this, kewwww?\n\n\nThere was a technique you used when\nsearching for the others of my tribe,\nremember? That!\n\n{[0109|00060009]}Use that thing you do, kewww, and\nyou'll have a much easier time getting\nthose Tadtones!
FR_F3_MJ5_05	{[0109|0000000e]}Yes, yes! That's it! Dowsing! Use your\ndowsing ability, and you'll find the rest\nof those Tadtones in no time flat! ...Or\nis it sharp? Ahem...kewww...
FR_F3_MJ5_06	{[0109|00000002]}Kewwww, it's good to see you again!\nYes, things look a bit different here,\ndon't they?\n\n{[0109|00040000]}The water came gushing out of the {color[0000]}base\nof the tree{color[ffff]} behind me{[010b|00000004]} and flooded the\nentire woods.\n\n{[0109|00000003]}I don't know what caused it,\nbut I suppose it will clear out the\nmonster infestation, kewww, so you\nwon't hear me complaining!
FR_F3_MJ5_07	{[0109|00060001]}All of a sudden water came gushing\nfrom the {color[0000]}base of the tree {color[ffff]}and flooded\nthe entire woods, kewwwww.\n\n{[0109|00010006]}But, you know...I rather like it this\nway! Oh ho ho!
FR_F3_MJ5_08	{[0109|0000000e]}Oh, {[0200]}! \nYou've gathered all the Tadtones,\nhaven't you? That's no small feat! Or \nshould I say no small beat, kewwwww!\nAhem... Anyway, hurry and return to\nthe {color[0003]}Water Dragon{color[ffff]}!
FR_F3_MJ5_09	{[0109|0000000e]}Hey, {[0200]}! Some nasty\nfish seem to have swam their way into\nthe flooded woods. I'd hate to bump \ninto those things underwater, kewww!\nWatch your toes!
FR_F3_MJ5_10	{[0109|0000000e]}Kewwwwww, {[0200]}!\nCan you hear me?\n\n\nI thought up something good! Why\ndon't you come and chat with me for a\nmoment, kewwwwwww?
FR_F3_DR_01	{[0109|00000006]}If you wish to earn my favor, gather\nthe {color[0000]}Tadtones{color[ffff]} and return to me.
FR_F3_SJ_01	You can catch those rogue {color[0003]}Tadtones{color[ffff]}\nwith a {color[0004]}spin{color[ffff]}! It will pull them toward\nyou so you can grab them.\n\nOh... {[0104|001e]}But I guess you humans {color[0000]}use up air\n{color[ffff]}when you do that, so don't go\noverboard!
FR_F3_SJ_02	The pretty bubbles are {color[0000]}poisonous{color[ffff]}.\nBe careful! If you breathe one in,\nyou'll {color[0000]}choke{color[ffff]}!
FR_F3_SJ_03	Hey, are you collecting Tadtones?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yep.{[0101|ffff]}Nope.
FR_F3_SJ_10	Oh...sorry.
FR_F3_SJ_09	I'll let you in on a secret, then.\n\n\n\nSome Tadtones hang out in groups.\nYou have to catch those similar\nTadtones {color[0000]}one right after the other{color[ffff]}, or\nthey'll swim out of your score.\nIf you want to catch a bunch at once,\nuse a {color[0004]}spin maneuver{color[ffff]} to {color[0000]}draw in{color[ffff]} nearby\nTadtones. That's your best bet.\n\nAside from that...{[0104|001e]}it's really just a\nmatter of keeping at it!
FR_F3_SJ_11	Some Tadtones hang out in groups.\nYou have to catch those similar\nTadtones {color[0000]}one right after the other{color[ffff]}, or\nthey'll swim out of your score.\nIf you want to catch a bunch at once,\nuse a {color[0004]}spin maneuver{color[ffff]} to {color[0000]}draw in{color[ffff]} nearby\nTadtones. That's your best bet.
FR_F3_SJ_04	If you don't collect Tadtones of the\nsame color {color[0000]}one right after another{color[ffff]},\nthey'll wriggle out of your score.\nBut don't work yourself into a panic!
FR_F3_SJ_08	If you make those spiky things {color[0000]}explode{color[ffff]},\nyou're in for a world of hurt. They're\nlike bombs!
FR_F3_SJ_13	Tadtones get along with everybody.\nYou can usually find them where\n{color[0000]}other fish are swimming{color[ffff]}.
FR_F3_SJ_05	Hurry back! The {color[0003]}Water Dragon {color[ffff]}is\nwaiting!
FR_F3_SJ_06	Those big fish are scary. They charge\nyou for no reason! So testy... I'm glad\nnone of them are around right now.
FR_F3_SJ_12	The {color[0003]}ferocious fish{color[ffff]} are baaaaack!\nSWIM FOR YOUR LIFE!\n\n\nThey can't follow you if you dive\n{color[0000]}deep{color[ffff]}!
FR_F3_SJ_17	Tadtones store oxygen in their bodies,\nso when you catch one, it will {color[0000]}restore\nsome of your air{color[ffff]}.
FR_F3_SJ_07	The Kikwi elder has been looking for\nyou. Why don't you go and hear what he\nhas to say?
FR_F3_SJ_14	The woods have been flooded!
FR_F3_SJ_19	The Water Dragon is furious!
FR_F3_SJ_20	There aren't as many monsters in the\nwoods anymore.
FR_F3_SJ_21	The woods are a lake now!
FR_F3_SWORD_01	Signs indicate this is a reference to\nyour {color[0000]}dowsing{color[ffff]} ability.\n\n\nIt is a valid suggestion, {[0112|00000002]}Master. I am\nfamiliar with the unique aura\nsignatures of Tadtones.
FR_F3_SWORD_02	I will calibrate your {[010b|00000004]}{color[0000]}dowsing{color[ffff]} ability to\nlocate Tadtones. This capability should\nprove to be quite useful in your search.\n\nHowever, please note that you {color[0000]}cannot\nuse your dowsing ability underwater{color[ffff]}.
FR_F3_SJ_15	Hey, hey! The current is pretty strong\npast here. If you're heading outside,\nyou better use the exit above!
FR_F3_SJ_16	It's a human!\n\n\n\nThe current is strong beyond this\npoint. It's too swift for a human like\nyou to swim through, so you better\nuse the exit over there.
2-Forest\250-ForestSiren.msbt
FR_SIREN_01	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}.
FR_SIREN_02	As expected, I cannot follow you into\nthis realm, for this trial calls out to\nyour mind{[0112|00000002]} alone.\n\nThis is the nature of places known as\n{color[0003]}Silent Realms{color[ffff]}. They are domains of the\nspirit, accessible only to the goddess's\nchosen hero.\nThis particular trial, {color[0003]}Farore's Silent\nRealm{color[ffff]}, tests the limits of your {color[0000]}courage{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n{[0112|00000001]}Your spirit has temporarily separated\nfrom your physical body so that you\nmay undertake this challenge.\n\nTo reach the location of the flames\nthat will enhance your sword, it is\nnecessary for {[0112|00000002]}you to overcome this\ntrial and undergo spiritual growth.
FR_SIREN_03	I will await your return in the outside\nworld.
FR_SIREN_04	That is your {color[0005]}{[0201|0011]}{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n\nWhen this vessel is full, it will signify\nyou have successfully completed the\ntrial, allowing your spirit to grow.\n\nThis, in turn, will allow the goddess\nto bless you with a {color[0000]}new power{color[ffff]}.
FR_SIREN_05	To fill the {color[0005]}{[0201|0011]}{color[ffff]}, you need to\nsearch for something known as a\n{color[0005]}{[0201|002b]}{color[ffff]}. There are many of \nthem spread across this strange world.
FR_SIREN_05_2	{[0112|00000002]}Master, do you see the glowing\nobject just in front of you?
FR_SIREN_05_3	That is a {color[0005]}{[0201|002b]}{color[ffff]}.\nYou will need to collect {color[0000]}15 {color[ffff]}of them.
FR_SIREN_06	However, this is not as simple a task\nas it would seem. Your work in this\nrealm is referred to as a {color[0000]}trial{color[ffff]} for\ngood reason.
FR_SIREN_07_2	If you take even a single step outside\nthe protective circle you stand in, the\n{color[0000]}Guardians {color[ffff]}of this realm will wake up\nand pursue you, {[0112|00000002]}Master.
FR_SIREN_07_3	If a {color[0000]}Guardian {color[ffff]}manages to land even a\nsingle hit on you, your spirit will\nshatter and you will fail the trial.
FR_SIREN_07_4	You must collect the {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]} scattered\nthroughout this area and fill the\n{color[0005]}{[0201|0011]} {color[ffff]}without being hit by\nan attack.
FR_SIREN_08	{[0112|00000005]}Understood, Master.\n\n\n\nI will be eagerly awaiting your return\nin the outside world.\n\n\nMay the goddess watch over you,\n{[0112|00000001]}Master.
FR_SIREN_09	Was my explanation clear, {[0112|00000002]}Master?\nDo you want me to explain again?\n{[0100|ffff]}Explain again.{[0101|0000]}I got it.
FR_SIREN_15	Which topic do you wish to review?\n\n\n{[0100|ffff]}The {[0201|0011]}?{[0101|ffff]}Guardians?{[0102|ffff]}Silent Realm?{[0103|0000]}Never mind.
FR_SIREN_16	{[0112|00000005]}Understood, Master.
FR_SIREN_17	The {color[0003]}Silent Realm {color[ffff]}is a {color[0000]}spirit world{color[ffff]} that\nonly the goddess's chosen hero is\nallowed to enter.\n\nYou have separated from your physical\nform and exist in this world as a spirit.\n\n\nThe tasks you perform here test your\nspiritual resolve. You must focus and\ncomplete the trial.
FR_SIREN_10	When your {color[0005]}{[0201|0011]}{color[ffff]} is filled with\n15 {color[0000]}tears{color[ffff]}, your spirit will grow and you\nwill be blessed by the goddess with a\nnew power.\n{[0112|00000002]}Master, I will await your return in the\noutside world.
FR_SIREN_20	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, I can\nunfortunately confirm that you\nhave failed to pass the trial.
FR_SIREN_22	Collect all the {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]} within the Silent\nRealm. I shall await your return here.
FR_SIREN_11	{[0112|00000002]}Master, so long as you have the will and\ndetermination, you can retry a trial\nas many times as you like.\n\nA good strategy is {color[0000]}to find, but then\ndeliberately not pick up{color[ffff]}, the most-\neasily-accessible {color[0005]}{color[0005]}tears{color[0005]} {color[ffff]}until you are\ndiscovered and really need one.\nCollect the 15 {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]} and complete the\ntrial. I will await your return in the\noutside world.
FR_SIREN_12	The locations of {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]} you have\ngathered during your trial are\n{color[0000]}marked on the map{color[ffff]}.\n\nYou will have an easier time\ncompleting your task if you first set\nout to discover the locations of all\n15 tears.
FR_SIREN_21	{color[0000]}Two types of Watchers {color[ffff]}patrol the\nrealm, looking for intruders. I highly\nsuggest you take caution.\n\nSo long as you do not step into their\nlight, you will remain undetected\nby {color[0000]}flying Sky Watchers{color[ffff]}.\n\nHowever, the {color[0000]}Earth Watchers{color[ffff]}, who\n{color[0000]}hover near the ground{color[ffff]}, will give chase\nif you come too close to them, so {color[0000]}stay\nalert {color[ffff]}and maintain a safe distance.
FR_SIREN_13	{[0112|00000001]}Master, the chances of your not being\nthe chosen one are increasing...\n\n\nRepeated attempts at this trial have\nscattered your concentration and made\nyour performance erratic. I suggest\nyou rest awhile before trying again.
FR_SIREN_14	I suggest using smart tactics to your\nadvantage. Try {color[0000]}leaving easy-to-collect\ntears {color[ffff]}for when you are being pursued.
FR_SIREN_23	The locations of {color[0005]}tears {color[ffff]}that you have\npreviously collected will be {color[0000]}marked\non the map{color[ffff]}, so make good use of that.\n\nConfirm the locations of all 15 tears\nfirst to increase your chances of\nsuccessfully completing the trial.
FR_SIREN_24	{[0112|00000001]}Master, in addition to the {color[0000]}Guardians{color[ffff]}\nwho will attack you, there are also two\ntypes of {color[0000]}Watchers {color[ffff]}that search for\nintruders {color[0000]}on the ground and in the sky{color[ffff]}.\nThe two types of Watchers exhibit\ndramatically different behavior, so be\nsure you understand how to avoid\ndetection by both.
FR_SIREN_25	The unusual liquid substance that\ncovers that area is known as {color[0000]}Waking\nWater{color[ffff]}, and it has certain unique\nproperties.\nIf you make contact with Waking\nWater, the {color[0000]}Guardians will be\nimmediately alerted to your presence{color[ffff]}.\n\nPools of Waking Water are located all\nthroughout the area. I suggest you\nwatch where you step...

F_SAL_01	I can verify with only 40% accuracy\nthat this person is a plant. However,\n{color[0003]}Owlan{color[ffff]}'s field of study includes\ncataloging unidentified plant species.\nWe can take this creature to Skyloft\nusing the robot. Would you like to call\nthe robot?\n{[0100|ffff]}Please!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
F_SAL_01_01	Yes, {[0112|00000005]}Master. Simply inspect\nthe specimen again if you change your\nmind and wish to take it to Skyloft.
F_SAL_01_02	Yes, {[0112|00000005]}Master. I will signal the robot\nwith a telepathic transmission.
F_SAL_02	{[0112|00000064]}Mistress Fi! I hope you weren't\nwaiting long, bzzzzat! So you want me\nto carry this, zrrbt?
F_SAL_03	I'll be waiting for you up in the sky,\nso don't take too long, vrrrt!
F_SAL_04	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I suggest we also return to\nthe sky and carry the Kikwi to its\ndestination quickly.
F_SAL_05	{[0112|00000064]}Move it! Move it! Zrrppt! Forcing me to\ntell you this every time reduces my\noverall efficiency, brrzt!
F_SAL_MORY01	{[0109|00000001]}Oh, hello again, kweek! I've been\nhiding out so long my shoulders are\nstiff.\n{[0100|ffff]}What shoulders?{[0101|ffff]}Poor thing.
F_SAL_MORY02	{[0109|00090014]}How rude! I do have shoulders,\nkweek—they're just not very\npronounced!\n\n{[0109|00070011]}All I was trying to say is that constantly\nhiding from danger is a stressful way to\nlive, koo-keek!
F_SAL_MORY06	{[0109|00070011]}That's right, kwee! Sitting in one spot\nall the time, never knowing when\ndanger is going to come along...kook.\nYou can't know what that's like!
F_SAL_MORY03	{[0109|00090013]}I bet there are still tons of horrible\nmonsters out there waiting to scratch\nme and do mean things, koo-weep!\n\n{[0109|00070004]}We Kikwis have to spend our entire\nlives hiding like this just to survive,\nkwee-koo!
F_SAL_MORY03_2	{[0109|00090013]}Everyone seems happy that peace\nhas returned to the forest... But I don't\nbelieve it for a second, koo-kakoo!\n\n{[0109|00070004]}There's no way I'm going to give up\nand come out of hiding. Not ever,\nkee-woop!
F_SAL_MORY04	{[0109|00090005]}But sometimes I wonder, keep-eep...\nIsn't there somewhere peaceful I can\nlive without fear, without having to\nhide?\n{[0100|ffff]}There is!{[0101|ffff]}I can help.
F_SAL_MORY05	{[0109|00060007]}Oh! That's fantastic news, koo-karoo!\nI want you to take me there as soon as\nyou can!
F_SAL_MORY07	{[0109|00070014]}You've got some nerve, ko-ko-ko!\nHow dare you promise to take me to\nthe skies, kee-roo, and then suddenly\nchange your mind!\n{[0109|00090013]}I was so sad thinking I would never get\nto settle down somewhere safe,\nkee-reep!
F_SAL_MORY08	{[0109|00070004]}So! Take me with you this time, ka-koo!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00000001]}Kee-karoo! Don't let me down!

Demo21_01:01	Look who it is...
Demo21_01:02	I thought that tornado I stirred up\nwould have tossed and torn you apart,\nyet here you are. Not in pieces.
Demo21_01:03	Not that your life or death has any\nconsequence.
Demo21_01:04	It's just the girl that matters now, \nand I can sense her here...just beyond\nthis door.\n\nYes, we plucked Her Majesty from her\nperch in the clouds, and now she's ours.
Demo21_01:05	Oh, but listen to me. I'm being\npositively uncivil. Allow me to\nintroduce myself.\n\nI am the Demon Lord who presides\nover this land you look down upon, this\nworld you call the surface. You may\ncall me {color[0003]}{[0108|01cd]}Ghirahim{color[ffff]}.\n{[0108|00cd]}{[0106|ffcd]}In truth, {[0104|001e]}{[0106|00cd]}I very much prefer to be \nindulged with my full title:\n{[0108|01cd]}Lord Ghirahim.{[0104|0014]}{[0108|00cd]} But I'm not fussy.
Demo21_01:07	Did you really just draw your sword?\nFoolish boy.
Demo21_01:08	By all rights the girl should have fallen\ninto our hands already.
Demo21_01:09	She was nearly ours when that\nloathsome servant of the goddess\nsnatched her away.\n\nDo you have any idea how that made\nme feel inside?
Demo21_01:10	{[0104|000f]}Furious!{[0104|001e]} Outraged!{[0104|0019]}\nSick with anger!{[0104|002d]} 
Demo21_01:13	This turn of events has left me with a\nstrong appetite for bloodshed.
Demo21_01:14	Still...it hardly seems fair, being of my\nposition, to take all of my anger out\non you.\n\nWhich is why I promise up front not to\nmurder you...
Demo21_01:15	No, I'll just beat you within an inch of\nyour life!
Demo23_01:01	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I have a message written in the\nlanguage of the gods of old. Allow me\nto translate for you.
Demo23_01:02	{color[0002]}From the edge of time I guide you,\nthe one chosen to carry out the\ngoddess's mission.{color[ffff]}
Demo23_01:03	{color[0002]}The spirit maiden who descended\nfrom the clouds must travel to two\nsacred places to purify her body.\n{color[ffff]}\n{color[0002]}You stand in one of these places:\n{color[0000]}Skyview Spring{color[0002]}. The other is known\nas the {color[0000]}Earth Spring{color[0002]}.{color[0000]}{color[0002]}{color[ffff]}
Demo23_01:04	{color[0002]}This second spring is hidden away deep\nwithin the scorched earth of {color[0000]}Eldin{color[0002]}.{color[ffff]}{color[0002]}\n\n\n{color[0002]}The spirit maiden, ever mindful of the\nheavy task entrusted to her, has set out\nfor this second sacred place.{color[0002]}{color[ffff]}
Demo23_01:05	You got the {color[0005]}Ruby Tablet{color[ffff]}! \nThe weathered surface of this heavy stone\ntablet feels very old.
Demo47_00:01	{[0112|00000001]}Raise your sword, Master.
Demo47_00:02	The flames of Farore have improved your\nsword, making it longer and sharp enough\nto do twice as much damage!
Demo47_00:03	The sacred flame has purified your\nblade, {[0112|00000002]}enhancing and evolving it.
Demo47_00:04	With your sword now enhanced{[0112|00000002]},\nyou are ready to learn a new melody.\nWe should return to the {color[0003]}Isle of Songs{color[ffff]}.
Demo64_02:01	Who dares to dip even a toe in my\nwaters without my leave?
Demo64_02:02	Oh, I remember you. You're the young\nhuman who helped me recover from my\ninjuries some time ago. \nAh...{[0200]}, was it?
Demo64_02:03	Let's have a look at you... Yes, you\nseem a good deal stronger than the\nlast time we met.\n\nAnd look at that sword... You're the\nreal thing, boy. It's clear you have\nthe spirit of a hero of the goddess.
Demo64_02:04	Let me guess... You swam all the way\nhere to try to get me to teach you the \npart of the {color[0003]}Song of the Hero {color[ffff]}the \ngoddess entrusted to me.
Demo64_02:05	That's all well and good, but I can't go\naround giving away something that \nprecious to every hero who flounders\ninto my waters.\nNo, I think a final test is in order to \nensure you are in fact the one meant to\nhear this melody of mine.\n\nThis may be news to you, but some very\nirksome monsters have been \noverrunning my woods of late.\n\nWell, I decided that I'd had enough!\nThe easiest way to deal with the awful\nthings was to flood the whole woods.
Demo64_02:06	As it happens, almost every inch of\ngreenery in the area is submerged.\nSo it's here, in this flooded land, that I\nwill test you.\nIf you're up to completing the task I\nask of you, I see no reason why I\nshouldn't reward you with the melody\nyou seek.
Demo64_03:01	As you just saw, I have split the melody\nyou seek among my many Tadtones and \nI have hidden them around the forest.
Demo64_03:02	If you haven't already guessed,\n{[0200]}, here's your task:\ntake this score and {color[0004]}collect{color[ffff]} all my little\nmusical friends out there.
Demo64_03:03	You can use that score to figure out\nhow many Tadtones are in each group.\nFind them, collect them, and bring\nthem back to me.
Demo64_03:04	If you can do that, well, then I'll just\nhave to see you as someone worthy of\nlearning the {color[0003]}Song of the Hero{color[ffff]}.
Demo64_04:02	You learned part of the {color[0005]}Song of the Hero{color[ffff]}!
Demo64_04:01	Ah, you've brought back all my colorful\nlittle Tadtones. \n\n\n{[0109|00000700]}You are indeed worthy of being called\na hero. This much is clear. I'm good for\nmy word, so I will teach you my part\nof the song you seek.
Demo64_04:03	Originally, I had planned to keep these\nwoods underwater so that those awful\nmonsters could never return.\n\n{[0109|00000700]}But your task is far from over, and\nyou're not exactly at home in the water.\nI suppose I'll return the woods to their\nnatural state.\n{[0109|00000700]}All this excitement has been rather\ndraining. I believe I'll retire to my hall.\nYou'd best be on your way as well.

MT_F1_SWORD_00	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I require your confirmation.\nYou are currently attempting to\nascertain the location of {color[0000]}Zelda{color[ffff]}.\n\nAre you familiar with how to use\n{color[0000]}dowsing {color[ffff]}to search for Zelda?\n{[0100|ffff]}Of course! {[0101|ffff]}I forgot...
MT_F1_SWORD_13	{[0105|004b0000]}{[0112|0000000b]}Master, this is {color[0003]}Eldin Volcano{color[ffff]}. It is an\nactive volcano rich with the power\nof the earth.
MT_F1_SWORD_14	{[0105|005a0000]}Approximately 65% of the region is\ncovered by lava. It is inhabited by a\nlarge number of creatures that thrive\nin the extreme heat and direct flame.
MT_F1_SWORD_15	{[0105|005a0000]}Please exercise caution with flammable\nmaterials such as {color[0000]}wood {color[ffff]}and {color[0000]}fabric{color[ffff]}.
MT_F1_SWORD_16	{[0105|004b0000]}In the event you catch on fire, I highly\nrecommend you extinguish the flames\nby performing a{color[0004]} forward roll{color[ffff]} or a {color[0004]}spin\nattack{color[ffff]}.
MT_F1_SWORD_03	{[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}, I require\nyour confirmation on critical\ninformation obtained from that\n{color[0003]}Mogma {color[ffff]}conversation.\nThe{color[0000]} oddly garbed figure {color[ffff]}taken deeper\ninto the region must be...\n{[0100|ffff]}Zelda! {[0101|ffff]}Woman in black?
MT_F1_SWORD_04	{[0112|00000005]}My calculations agree, Master. \nThere is a 90% probability the figure in\nquestion was indeed Zelda.
MT_F1_SWORD_05	The woman in black? The probability\nof your assessment being correct\nis...{[0108|01cd]}10%. {[0108|00cd]}Rounded up.\n\nI conclude the subject was likely\n{color[0000]}Zelda{color[ffff]}.
MT_F1_SWORD_08	Additionally, I calculate there is a 95%\nprobability that the key to this door is\nmade of the same material composition\nas this mechanism that bars it. 
MT_F1_SWORD_09	I have detected objects of the same\nmaterial in the surrounding area.\n\n\nAscertaining the location of these\nobjects will aid in our search for\n{color[0000]}Zelda{color[ffff]}. I have registered them as\n{color[0000]}dowsing {color[ffff]}targets.{[010b|00000004]}
MT_F1_SWORD_17	{[0112|00000005]}Of course you do. My apologies. Please\ncontinue your search for Zelda.
MT_F1_SWORD_18	{[0112|00000005]}Understood, Master. To begin {color[0000]}dowsing{color[ffff]},\npress and hold {[0204|10cd]}.{[0111|08cd]}\n\n\nOnce you select a dowsing target, you\nwill be able to sense the target through\nthe tip of your sword.\n\nThe closer you get to the target, the\n{color[0000]}stronger the sword's reaction will\nbecome{color[ffff]}. You will be alerted with a\nvibration and audible cue.\nYou may also use the {color[0000]}cursor {color[ffff]}to gauge\nan accurate direction of the target's\nlocation.\n\nPlease select Zelda as your dowsing\ntarget and commence your search.
MT_F1_SWORD_10	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I am detecting{color[0000]} extremely high\ntemperatures {color[ffff]}from the area directly\nahead.\n\nI calculate a 95% chance your clothing\nwill immediately combust upon\nentrance. Please proceed with caution. \n\nYou may be able to pass through safely\nif you{color[0004]} run{color[ffff]}. I recommend confirming\nyour direction by {color[0000]}dowsing {color[ffff]}before\nmaking the attempt.
MT_F1_SWORD_11	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I am detecting{color[0000]} extremely high\ntemperatures{color[ffff]} from the area ahead.\nYou will not survive this environment\nwith your {[0112|00000002]}heart total.\nAdditionally, {color[0000]}dowsing {color[ffff]}results do not\nsupport this path. Please reconfirm\nthe correct direction to proceed.
MT_F1_SWORD_12	Master, I am detecting {color[0000]}extremely high\ntemperatures{color[ffff]} from the area directly\nahead.\n\nYou will not survive this environment\nwith your current {[0112|00000002]}heart total.\nI recommend you turn back.
MT_F1_SWORD_02	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, the abilities of your sword have\nincreased. It is now possible to {color[0000]}dowse\n{color[ffff]}for {color[0005]}Rupees{color[ffff]}.\n\nI have registered {color[0005]}Rupees {color[ffff]}as a viable\n{color[0000]}dowsing{color[ffff]} target. {[010b|00000004]}Use this exciting new\nfeature as you deem necessary.
MT_F1_MZ_31	Whoa! Now there's a green one!
MT_F1_MZ_46	One of your people just came charging\nthrough here. {color[0000]}Dressed all in black{color[ffff]}!\nThat a friend of yours?{[010b|00000004]}
MT_F1_MZ_39	See that up ahead? That's what we call\na drop-dead dead end, but this\ncharacter danced right over it.
MT_F1_MZ_40	Seriously? Jumping over a gap like\nthat? {[0104|000f]}My jaw hit the dirt.
MT_F1_MZ_38	The mountains ahead are crawling with\nthose red troublemakers, but...\n\n\nI got a feeling that shady so-and-so is\ngonna zip right on by 'em.\n\n\nCan you imagine treasure hunting with\nsomeone who could do that? {[0109|001502ff]}You got\nyourself some good friends, don'tcha?
MT_F1_MZ_00	Grrr... Those creeps just shimmied on\nin and took over our territory.
MT_F1_MZ_22	Yeow! What're you doing? Don't be\nsneakin' up on me like that!\n\n\nHuh? You're looking for your friend?{[0109|001412ff]}\nCan't help you there. {[0109|00ffffff]}Nobody's come\nthrough here, so...\n\nMaybe they went{[010a|000900cd]} up the mountain\nfrom over thataway.
MT_F1_MZ_32	Ahh... {[0104|0014]}Wish someone would chase these\nclowns outta here.
MT_F1_MZ_15	Now there's an idea! Why don'tcha\nmake yourself useful and get rid of\n'em? {[0109|00141209]}Yeah, like that's gonna happen...
MT_F1_MZ_36	{[0109|0011080e]}What's that? You're really gonna\nsend those creeps packing?\n\n\n{[0109|00151200]}Well, seems like they're extra mad at\nyou, so... Guess it's only natural that\nyou had to handle things.\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}But did you notice when you start\nwhittling 'em down, they call in\nreinforcements with that {color[0000]}horn{color[ffff]}?\nThat ain't a fair fight, if you ask me.\nI bet the horn blower in the {color[0000]}blue cap{color[ffff]}{[010b|00000004]}\nis the leader.
MT_F1_MZ_37	When that creep in the {color[0000]}blue hat {color[ffff]}blows\nhis horn, it starts a bad-guy stampede.\nWhat're you gonna do about it?
MT_F1_MZ_41	Whoa... {[0104|000f]}You took out every last one\nof 'em...{[0104|000f]}
MT_F1_MZ_01	You're one tough customer! Thanks for\nall your help!\n\n\n{[0109|00ffff0b]}I don't blame you for not knowing\nthis, but us {color[0003]}Mogmas {color[ffff]}always honor our\ndebts. Let me give you something to\nprove it. Any special requests?\n{[0100|ffff]}A way forward.{[0101|ffff]}Rupees!
MT_F1_MZ_42	Oh, right. You're trying to find your\nfriend, aren'tcha?\n\n\n{[0109|00090809]}In that case, take these things!\nThey're something pretty special, if I\nsay so myself.
MT_F1_MZ_43	Huh? Rupees? Is that really what\nyou're after?\n\n\n{[0109|00151204]}{[0108|ffcd]}I mean, it's his reward and all, but...really?\nJust Rupees? Seems like a waste of a reward\nopportunity to me. And I don't even have any.\n{[0104|0014]}Oh wait, I know. I got something good instead.\n{[0109|001412ff]}So, hey...uh...{[0104|000f]}I don't exactly have any\nRupees on me...\n\n\n{[0109|00110809]}But I got something better! Didn't you\nsay you were looking for a friend?\nWell, I got something that can help you\nreach this friend... Take these instead!
MT_F1_MZ_02	With these, you should be able to get to\nthe top of that ledge right behind me.{[010a|000b00cd]}\nJust try digging in that hole below the\nledge. You're in for a surprise!
MT_F1_MZ_44	{[0108|ffcd]}It's not like I'm using these things, you know?\nAnd they're WAY better than Rupees!
MT_F1_MZ_35	I just hope your friend hasn't been\ncaptured by those red guys. Here's\nhoping everything's OK.
MT_F1_MZ_03	Hey, I'm hoping you find your friend\nall in one piece!
MT_F1_MZ_04	Hmm... I'm sure they buried it around\nhere someplace, but I can't find it.
MT_F1_MZ_05	Yo, {color[0003]}Ledd{color[ffff]}! This is the place, ain't it?\nSo what is it they buried again?
MT_F1_MZ_06	A {color[0000]}key{color[ffff]}! {color[0000]}K-E-Y{color[ffff]}, {color[0000]}KEY{color[ffff]}!
MT_F1_MZ_45	They busted up the {color[0000]}key to that door {color[ffff]}and\nhid the pieces all over the place.\n\n\nI'm telling you, one of the {color[0000]}five pieces {color[ffff]}is\nburied right around here.
MT_F1_MZ_07	Hey, that reminds me... That{color[0000]} strange\nblonde girl in the weird clothes {color[ffff]}{[010b|00000004]}got\ntaken away too.
MT_F1_MZ_08	{[0109|10110d0b]}That's right! I bet they got something\nreally valuable stashed in there.\n\n\n{[0109|10090800]}And that blonde girl they took is\nprobably part of their master plan too.\nI'm telling you, I can smell the riches\nfrom here!
MT_F1_MZ_09	So what're you saying we do once we\nfind all the pieces to the key?
MT_F1_MZ_10	{[0109|10110d09]}Whaddya think, igneous? We sneak\ninside and take all the treasure we\ncan carry!
MT_F1_MZ_11	Hey...{[0104|000f]} Why are we so worried about a\nkey when we can just dig our way in?
MT_F1_MZ_12	What? Um...{[0104|001e]}
MT_F1_MZ_13	Just sayin'.{[0104|001e]}
MT_F1_MZ_14	You ain't as dumb as you look!
MT_F1_MZ_16	Hey! Hey! HEY! Y-you mess with our\nturf and you're gonna...pay?
MT_F1_MZ_16_01	Whoa! You're not...{[0104|000f]} Yo, {color[0003]}Ledd{color[ffff]}, I don't\nthink this is one of those red creeps.
MT_F1_MZ_16_02	{[0109|00010800]}Y-y-yeah, I think you're right...\nNo reason to scare the hair off us,\nthough!\n\n{[0109|00110d01]}Sorry 'bout that, pal. These monsters\nshowing up and messing with our\nturf has got me on edge.\n\n{[0109|00150800]}They show up here, and I'm gonna\nknock the red clean out of 'em!\nThat's what I'm doing here.\nYeah, me, {color[0003]}Ledd{color[ffff]}.
MT_F1_MZ_16_03	{[0108|ffcd]}Yeah, whatever, Mr. Too Scared to Dig in\nthe Dark.
MT_F1_MZ_16_04	Anyway, if you're looking for treasure,\nyou should stay clear of those red guys.
MT_F1_MZ_17	{[0109|00110d11]}Huh? You're looking for a friend?\nNOT treasure?\n\n\n{[0109|00ffff0e]}So that must have been your pal that\npassed by earlier, {color[0000]}sprinting by {color[ffff]}without\nso much as a glance in this direction.{[010b|00000004]}\n\nIt was sorta a blur of movement, so I\ndidn't get a real good look, but I knew\nit wasn't one of those red creeps.\n\nYour pal must have gone straight up\nhere, so why don't you follow?
MT_F1_MZ_18	Us {color[0003]}Mogmas {color[ffff]}have claimed this territory\nto search around for riches. We're\nwhat you'd call {color[0003]}treasure hunters{color[ffff]}.\n\nThere are loads of these red, blue, and\ngreen stones called {color[0005]}Rupees {color[ffff]}around\nhere. Sometimes you can even find\n{color[0000]}silver {color[ffff]}and{color[0000]} gold {color[ffff]}ones too.\nAnd while they ain't technically\ntreasure, you can also find these tough\n{color[0000]}mineral chunks{color[ffff]}. I bet you could {color[0000]}use 'em\nto make stuff{color[ffff]}.\nSince you're here and all, you might as\nwell look around, right?
MT_F1_MZ_19	The one that went running through\nhere looked kinda like you.\n\n\nI don't think he was dressed in green,\nthough.
MT_F1_MZ_20	There are loads of these red, blue, and\ngreen stones called {color[0005]}Rupees {color[ffff]}around\nhere. Sometimes you can even find\n{color[0000]}silver {color[ffff]}and{color[0000]} gold {color[ffff]}ones too.\nAnd while they ain't technically\ntreasure, you can also find these tough\n{color[0000]}crystals{color[ffff]}. I bet you could {color[0000]}use them to\nmake stuff{color[ffff]}.
MT_F1_MZ_21_01	Gyaah! Sneak attack!\n\n\n\nWait... You ain't one of those red guys.\n{[0104|000f]}{[0109|10090807]}Don't creep up on me like that!\nAlmost had to tackle ya there.\n\n{[0109|100aff00]}Didn't mean to yell at ya, but those red\njerks moved in and have been stinking\nup our turf, ya know?
MT_F1_MZ_21_02	They came up through that hole back\nthere, so I sunk the road leading to it\nin lava. That'll stop more of 'em\nfrom moving in, I'd say.
MT_F1_MZ_21_03	Of course, we can tunnel underneath\nit, so it's no sweat for us.\n{[0109|1011080b]}Pretty clever, right?
MT_F1_MZ_21_04	So stay away from the plug that's\nholding back the lava. It'll do more\nthan singe your brows off. Bye now!
MT_F1_MZ_21_05	Gyaah! Sneak attack! Hey, where'd all\nthe lava go? Now the road's open\nagain! You won't get away with this!
MT_F1_MZ_23	Whoa! You scared me silly! {[0104|0014]}{[0109|00110d00]}You can't\njust start digging right above my head,\nyou know?\n\n{[0109|00150809]}But I get where you're coming from.\nYou never know what you're going to\nfind when you dig, so it's impossible to\nstop!\n{color[0000]}{[0109|00ffffff]}Rupees {color[ffff]}are the most common treasure\nyou'll dig up, but sometimes you might\neven score {color[0000]}Eldin Ore{color[ffff]} or some {color[0000]}hearts{color[ffff]}!\n\nSo if you run across a hole and you've\ngot the time, dig, dig, dig!
MT_F1_MZ_23_02	Whoa! You scared me silly! {[0104|0014]}{[0109|00110d00]}You can't\njust start digging right above my head,\nyou know?\n\n{[0109|00150809]}But I get where you're coming from.\nYou never know what you're going to\nfind when you dig. That's what makes\nit so impossible to stop!\n{color[0000]}{[0109|00ffffff]}Rupees {color[ffff]}are the most common thing\nyou'll dig up, but you might get some\n{color[0000]}Eldin Ore {color[ffff]}as well!\n\n{[0109|00150d11]}Used to be plenty of hearts buried down\nhere too, but weirdly enough I haven't\nseen any recently. Go figure.\n\n{[0109|00ffffff]}Anyhow, if you run across a hole and\nyou've got the time, dig, dig, dig!
MT_F1_MZ_23_01	Oh, hey! Sometimes these{color[0000]} red, blobby\nthings {color[ffff]}will pop out too. Disgusting!\nBe careful not to let 'em grab you.
MT_F1_MZ_24	Hey, you! You're gonna try your mitts\nat {color[0003]}Tubert's {color[ffff]}{color[0000]}Thrill Digger {color[ffff]}game, right?\n\n\n{[0109|0015080b]}Pssst. You want some {color[0000]}top-secret info{color[ffff]}?\nIt's guaranteed to make you rich!\n{[0109|00ffff00]}R-{[0104|000a]}I-{[0104|000a]}C-{[0104|000a]}H{[0104|000a]}.\n\nNow since you'll be lining your pockets\nwith Rupees, it's only fair I get a little\npiece of the pie. And I want my pie\nnow, thank you.
MT_F1_MZ_24_01	{[0109|001108ff]}I've got a super-discount price just\nfor you, buddy. How does {color[0000]}20 Rupees\n{color[ffff]}sound?\n{[0100|ffff]}Deal!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
MT_F1_MZ_25	Heh, heh... That's the spirit! Now\nyou've got to promise me this stays\nbetween the two of us. You gotta keep\nyour trap shut. Got it?
MT_F1_MZ_25_01	{[0109|0011ff00]}The color of the Rupee you dig up will\ntell you how many bad holes are\naround you.\n\n{[0109|00ffff0b]}Like if you dig up a{color[0007]} green Rupee{color[ffff]}, there\nare {color[0000]}no bad holes {color[ffff]}around it!\n\n\nA {color[0008]}blue Rupee {color[ffff]}will have {color[0000]}one or two bad\nholes{color[ffff]}. A{color[0009]} red Rupee {color[ffff]}will have{color[0000]} three or\nfour{color[ffff]}, and a {color[000a]}silver Rupee{color[ffff]} has got {color[0000]}five or\nsix{color[ffff]}.\nIf you're lucky enough to dig up a rare\n{color[000b]}gold Rupee{color[ffff]}, there will be {color[0000]}seven or eight\nbad holes {color[ffff]}nearby. There are almost no\ngood holes!
MT_F1_MZ_26	What do you think? Makes planning\nwhere to dig a bit easier, don't it?\n\n\n{[0109|00ffff09]}But at the end of the day, it comes down\nto luck. YOUR luck. So just do the\nbest you can, and cross your fingers\nor something.
MT_F1_MZ_27	Why you gotta be such a Rupee\npincher? Fortune's knocking at your\ndoor, pal.\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}All right, it's your call. You change\nyour mind, come see me. The info\nwill cost you {color[0000]}20 Rupees{color[ffff]}.
MT_F1_MZ_28	You listening? You've gotta remember\nthis. There are {color[0000]}no bad holes {color[ffff]}around a\n{color[0007]}green Rupee{color[ffff]}.\n\nA {color[0008]}blue Rupee {color[ffff]}will have {color[0000]}one or two bad\nholes {color[ffff]}around it, and a{color[0009]} red Rupee {color[ffff]}will\nhave {color[0000]}three or four{color[ffff]}.\n\nA {color[000a]}silver Rupee{color[ffff]} will be surrounded by\n{color[0000]}five or six bad holes{color[ffff]} and a {color[000b]}gold Rupee\n{color[ffff]}by {color[0000]}seven or eight{color[ffff]}. Those are the rules!\n\nThe only thing standing between you\nand being filthy rich is luck. {[0109|00150509]}Here's\nhoping you're luckier than you look.\nHeh heh.
MT_F1_MZ_29	C'mon, pal! You ain't got enough\nRupees.\n\n\n{[0109|00141209]}Unless you bring me exactly\n{color[0000]}20 Rupees{color[ffff]}, I'm not telling you a thing.
MT_F1_MZ_30	What? You looking to buy what I'm\nselling?
MT_F1_MZ_30_01	{[0109|00ffff00]}Secret information on {color[0000]}Thrill Digger\n{color[ffff]}can be yours for only {color[0000]}20 Rupees{color[ffff]}.\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me!{[0101|0000]}Nah...
MT_F1_MZ_33	Huh? Another stranger? And you're\nnot one of those red creeps, either.\nI swear this neighborhood's getting\ncrummier every day...
MT_F1_MZ_33_01	Huh? Oh, nothing, just talking to\nmyself. Hey, I saw this {color[0000]}funny-dressed\ncharacter {color[ffff]}go into that hole over there.
MT_F1_MZ_33_02	It might be the friend you're looking\nfor? You want to know what this\nkook was wearing?
MT_F1_MZ_33_03	{[0109|0014120c]}Let's see...{[0104|001e]} Yeah, I'm pretty sure the\ngetup was {color[0000]}blackish{color[ffff]}. Other than that, I\ndon't remember much.
MT_F1_MZ_34	I'm pretty sure the getup was blackish.\nBesides that, I don't remember much.
MT_F1_MZ_47	{[0109|00150d11]}Huh? Who're you supposed to be?\nNever seen you around here before...\n\n\nWhoa, hold it right there! {[0109|00110d12]}Are you a\nfriend of those red creeps?\n{[0100|ffff]}No way! {[0101|ffff]}Red creeps?
MT_F1_MZ_49	{[0109|00ffff07]}You're not, huh? {[0104|000f]}Well, you don't look\nlike 'em, that's for sure. You're not\nTHAT ugly.\n\n{[0109|0015ff00]}So what then? You here to pick\n{color[0005]}bomb flowers{color[ffff]}?\n{[0100|ffff]}Bomb what?{[0101|ffff]}Yep.
MT_F1_MZ_51	{[0109|00ffff00]}Yeah, monsters carrying big blades?\nThey're crawling all over the place.\nCan't believe you haven't run into any\nof 'em.\n{[0109|0015ff07]}But if you don't know 'em, I guess\nyou're not pals.\n\n\nSo what is it then? You here to pick\n{color[0005]}bomb flowers{color[ffff]}?\n{[0100|ffff]}Bomb what?{[0101|ffff]}Yep.
MT_F1_MZ_50	{[0109|00ffff00]}{color[0005]}Bomb flowers{color[ffff]}. You're joking, right?\n{[010a|001100cd]}Those are them growing right over\nthere.
MT_F1_MZ_52	You pick one with {[0204|00cd]}, and the fuse\nlights. A few seconds later...BOOM!\nYou don't wanna stop and sniff this\nflower. Dangerous plants, believe me.\n{[0109|0011080b]}But once you learn to use them, they're\na powerful weapon. Us {color[0003]}Mogmas {color[ffff]}are\ncrazy about 'em!\n\n{[0109|00ffffff]}You can {color[0004]}toss{color[ffff]} and {color[0004]}roll {color[ffff]}them the same\nway you do jars. See what you can do\nwith those {color[0005]}bomb flowers {color[ffff]}over there.\n\n{[0106|ffcd]}Um...{[0104|000f]}{[0106|00cd]}{[0109|00110d11]} Huh? You do know {color[0004]}how to roll\nand throw {color[ffff]}stuff, right?\n{[0100|ffff]}Uh-huh.{[0101|ffff]}Not really...
MT_F1_MZ_53	{[0109|0011020b]}That's what I figured. You can pick\nsome pretty powerful ones in this area.\n\n\n{[0109|00ffffff]}{[010a|001100cd]}Look! There are some right over there!\nTake as many as you want.
MT_F1_MZ_55	I'm sure you already know this, but\nonce you pick a flower with {[0204|00cd]}, the\nfuse starts burning. Then it'll blow up\nin just a couple of seconds.\nYou can also{color[0004]} toss{color[ffff]} or {color[0004]}roll {color[ffff]}them, just\nlike you can with some other stuff.\nYou should practice.\n\n{[0106|ffcd]}Um...{[0104|000f]}{[0106|00cd]}{[0109|00110d11]}huh? You do know {color[0004]}how to roll\n{color[ffff]}stuff, right?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yep.{[0101|ffff]}Not really...
MT_F1_MZ_71	{[0109|00090809]}Of course you do! You can {color[0004]}lift things up\n{color[ffff]}to throw them and {color[0004]}hold things below you\n{color[ffff]}to roll 'em. I mean, hey, everyone knows\nthat!
MT_F1_MZ_72	{[0109|00141215]}Don't know any of this stuff, huh?{[0104|000f]}\nNo worries, pal. I gotcha covered with\nall the info you need.\n\n{[0109|000908ff]}When you've got a {color[0005]}bomb flower{color[ffff]},\n{color[0004]}hold it up{color[ffff]}!\n\n\nThe trajectory of the bomb will show\nup for ya, so all ya do is line it up with\nyour target and{color[0004]} {color[ffff]}chuck it!\n\nA trajectory guide will also show up if\nyou {color[0004]}hold it down low{color[ffff]}. Then you can\n{color[0004]}roll {color[ffff]}the bomb along that guideline!\n\n{[0109|001108ff]}To reach places up {color[0000]}high{color[ffff]}, it's best to\nthrow bombs, but to {color[0000]}cover distances {color[ffff]}or\n{color[0000]}pass through narrow spaces{color[ffff]}, rolling is\ndefinitely the way to go.
MT_F1_MZ_48	I'm stating the obvious here, but you\ncan {color[0004]}pick up and put down {color[ffff]}{color[0005]}bomb flowers\n{color[ffff]}with {[0204|00cd]}, the same way you do with jars.\n\nWhen you're holding something, you can\nthrow it or you can roll it.\n\n\nIf you forget how, just pick something\nup and press {[0204|13cd]} to see the Help.\nPretty simple.{[0111|0bcd]}\n\nGo on and practice a bit with those\n{color[0005]}bomb flowers {color[ffff]}over there.
MT_F1_MZ_54	{[0109|00150d11]}You, uh...know you don't have\na {color[0005]}Bomb Bag{color[ffff]}, don'tcha?\n\n\n{[0109|00110dff]}Without a {color[0005]}Bomb Bag{color[ffff]}, you can't safely\ncarry {color[0005]}bomb flowers {color[ffff]}with you when\nyou're out and about. You won't find a\n{color[0003]}Mogma {color[ffff]}without one.\n{[0109|00ffffff]}What?{[0104|0014]} Why are you staring at me\nlike that?\n\n\n{[0109|00141209]}No! No way, no how. You are not\ngetting my bag. You'll have to be\nsatisfied with blowing up stuff\nright around here.
MT_F1_MZ_56	Hey! Welcome to my place! Make\nyourself at home.\n\n\n{[0109|1011080e]}What? Of course this is my house!\n\n\n\n{[0109|1015080a]}OK, OK, those red creeps built it,\nbut...{[0104|0014]} They split, right? So what's\nthe harm?\n\n{[0109|100908ff]}Us {color[0003]}Mogmas {color[ffff]}live in the ground, so we\ndon't have what you would call\n“houses." {[0109|1015080d]}I just wanted to see what it\nfelt like to say “Welcome to my place!"
MT_F1_MZ_57	Back again, huh? Don't mind me or\nanything—it's just MY HOUSE!\n\n\n{[0109|10110d0e]}What? What do you mean I didn't have\nto tunnel all the way up here?\n\n\n{[0109|10150809]}Look, I know it's a run-down, dirty\nhovel, but it's MINE! And I want to\nknow who's dropping by my dirty hovel.\n\n{[0109|100909ff]}Oh, and just 'cause you're all rested\ndoesn't mean you can {color[0004]}roll around\n{color[ffff]}and bust the place up!
MT_F1_MZ_77	Do me a favor, will ya? Try not to go\ncrazy and{color[0004]} roll around {color[ffff]}all over the\nplace. Dust bunnies, ya know?
MT_F1_MZ_58	{[0109|00000001]}Hey, you! Long time no see. Thanks\nfor helping me earlier.\n\n\nSpeaking of helping, did you find that\nfriend you were looking for?\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure did!{[0101|ffff]}Not yet...
MT_F1_MZ_59	{[0109|00110808]}You did? Heyyy, that's great news!{[0104|0014]}\nHuh? You haven't rescued her?\n\n\n{[0109|000908ff]}Don't look so glum, pal. I'm sure you'll\nfigure it out and save her.\nNever give up!
MT_F1_MZ_60	{[0109|0013100d]}Oh, really? You think those red creeps\nmight have...gulp...you know?{[0104|0014]}\n\n\n{[0109|0011080e]}What? You know she's still alive?\nThen everything's gonna be fine!\nStop with the sad face, will ya?\n\n{[0109|00090800]}You give up, she's done for. That's why\nya can't ever, ever crawl into your\ntunnel defeated. Ya hear me?
MT_F1_MZ_61	I just know your friend's waiting on\nyou. That's why ya can't ever, ever\ngive up!
MT_F1_MZ_62	{[0109|00150d0c]}Just curious, but...what do ya think\nthose red guys eat, anyway?
MT_F1_MZ_63	{[0109|00000001]}You're looking pretty chipper, pal.\n\n\n\n{[0109|001108ff]}You come back here to do some\ntreasure hunting this time? In that\ncase, I'll let you in on a little secret.\n\n{[0109|0009080b]}{color[0003]}Eldin Volcano {color[ffff]}is riddled with hidden\ncaves. You can find 'em by checking\naround for thin walls with cracks.\n\nYou can find all kinds of things in these\ncaves. It's mostly {color[0005]}Rupees{color[ffff]}, but ya never\nknow. {[0109|0015080c]}I got a hunch there's one right\naround here somewhere...
MT_F1_MZ_64	{[0109|00150d10]}Huh? It was right there all along?\nNice work, greenie.
MT_F1_MZ_65	{[0109|000908ff]}You can find caves aboveground\nand belowground. I bet you can sniff\nout thin walls wherever you go!
MT_F1_MZ_66	{[0109|0015080c]}I got a hunch there's one around here\nsomewhere...
MT_F1_MZ_67	Around here, you can find little\npockets or caves hidden behind thin,\ncracked walls. Who knows what\nyou might find in those places...
MT_F1_MZ_68	{[0109|00000001]}You're looking pretty chipper, pal.\nYou come back to do some treasure\nhunting?\n\n{[0109|00110800]}You may already know this, but {color[0003]}Eldin\nVolcano {color[ffff]}is riddled with hidden\ncaves.\n\n{[0109|000908ff]}You can find 'em by checking around\nfor thin, cracked walls.\n\n\nYou can find all kinds of things in these\ncaves. It's mostly {color[0005]}Rupees{color[ffff]}, sure, but ya\nnever know. {[0109|001108ff]}If you get the itch for loot,\nyou should try some cave hunting.
MT_F1_MZ_69	{[0109|00110801]}Hey, you! I hope you're taking good\ncare of my {color[0005]}Bomb Bag{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n{[0109|000909ff]}By the way, you ever been to the\nheart of {color[0003]}Eldin Volcano{color[ffff]}?\n\n\n{[0109|00150816]}It's so hot down there it'll burn the\nclothes right off your back. POOF!\nYour average traveler will be dead in\nminutes.\n{[0109|000909ff]}But if you survive... Well, rumor has it\nthere are amazing ruins overflowing\nwith piles and mountains of treasure.\n\n{[0109|0011080b]}Course, it's nothing for my people\nto just tunnel right in there, ya know?\nYeah... I may have to make the effort\nsometime in the near future.
MT_F1_MZ_70	{[0109|0015080b]}Long-lost ruins in the heart of a\nvolcano... Heh... Now that's a tale to\nget any {color[0003]}treasure hunter{color[ffff]}'s heart\npumping!
MT_F1_MZ_73	Hey, you! Did ya make it to the ruins?\n\n\n\n{[0109|0013100d]}I decided it wasn't worth the trouble.\nBoy, was my partner steamed!\n\n\n{[0109|000908ff]}He kept shouting, “All you had to do\nwas dig your way in! How hard could it\nbe?" {[0104|000f]}He's right too. Digging would\nhave made it easy. Heh heh...
MT_F1_MZ_74	Wonder where the next treasure might\nbe... Gotta remember not to forget\nabout the whole digging thing.
MT_F1_MZ_75	{[0109|00110801]}Hey, you. Hope you're taking good care\nof my {color[0005]}Bomb Bag{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n{[0109|000908ff]}I was nice enough to give it to you, so\nbe sure you put it to good use.\nOh, and don't burn a hole in it!
MT_F1_MZ_76	Wonder where my search for riches\nwill lead me next... A {color[0003]}treasure hunter's\njourney never ends{color[ffff]}. Heh heh...
MT_F1_MZ_78	{[0109|00110812]}Hey, you! You've really got those guys'\nattention. And it looks like they're\nspoiling for a fight.\n\n{[0109|00150d00]}Take one for the rest of us and chase\n'em outta here, will you?
MT_F1_MZ_79	{[0109|00110800]}Hey! No running away! Take care of\nthese creeps, will ya?
MT_F1_MZ_80	{[0109|00110809]}You got those creeps all worked up, so\nnow you've got to take care of 'em!\n\n\n{[0109|00ffffff]}But they keep using that {color[0000]}horn to call\nin reinforcements{color[ffff]}. They just keep\ncoming and coming!\n\nI bet the horn blower in the{color[0000]} blue hat{color[ffff]}{[010b|00000004]}\nis the leader.
TELOP_F200_01	Eldin Volcano
MT_F1_IN_00	{[0109|00000002]}You, the goddess's chosen hero...
MT_F1_IN_01	Zelda is ahead... {[0104|0014]}Hurry.
3-Mountain\301-MountainD1.msbt
MT_MZ_01	My partner's gone missing, and those\nred guys are everywhere!\nI never shoulda come here.
MT_MZ_10	Oh, it's you again. Come all this way\nin search of your friend, eh?\n\n\nThat reminds me...{[0104|000f]} Before I came in\nhere, I saw a{color[0000]} weird-looking blonde girl\n{color[ffff]}get dragged away.\n\nBut {[0109|00141215]}don't even dream about going to\nthe rescue. Those baddies are\neverywhere!\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}If you wanna live to...live again one\nday, you should head for home, pal!
MT_MZ_02	Blast! I must have dropped it earlier...
MT_MZ_09	Hey! Nice timing, pal. It's me, {color[0003]}Ledd{color[ffff]}!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00ffffff]}You showing up here must mean we're\nconnected somehow. You know, like\nfate or something. Anyways, do me a\nfavor and get my {color[0005]}Bomb Bag{color[ffff]}, OK?
MT_MZ_15	I was behind that rock looking for\ntreasure when those creeps showed up.{[0104|000f]}\nI panicked and hit the road, but{[0109|0013100d]}\nit looks like I dropped it.
MT_MZ_16	{[0109|000908ff]}It's a {color[0000]}bag for carrying around bomb\nflowers{color[ffff]}. I can't imagine not having one.\nOh, hey...I guess I don't have to\nimagine it, 'cause I lost mine!\nAnyway, it's back there... {[0104|000a]}{[0109|00110dff]}Do me a \nfavor and get my {color[0005]}Bomb Bag {color[ffff]}back,\nwill you?
MT_MZ_03	Oh, right... {[0104|000f]}You can't tunnel, so you\ncan't get back there. Hmm...\n\n\n{[0109|0015120c]}You should be able to blow your way\nin there with a {color[0005]}bomb flower{color[ffff]}. \n\n\n{[0109|0009ff00]}Why don't you start by seeing if there\nare any {color[0005]}bomb flowers {color[ffff]}in the area?
MT_MZ_14	I think you should be able to blow your\nway in there. Why don't you search the\narea for some {color[0005]}bomb flowers{color[ffff]}?
MT_MZ_17	{[0109|00150809]}Heh heh, nice work. Rolling {color[0005]}bomb\nflowers {color[ffff]}through there—that's the mark\nof a real professional adventurer!\n\n{[0109|00110800]}Keep it up, and go grab my {color[0005]}Bomb Bag{color[ffff]}!
MT_MZ_04	{[0109|00110d08]}Heyyyyy! You found my {color[0005]}Bomb Bag{color[ffff]}!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00ff08ff]}Sorry to put you through that. I guess \nI owe you one now! So let me have it...{[0104|0014]}\n\n\n{[0109|00110d0e]}What's this, now? You want to borrow\nit so you can go deeper into the\nvolcano?\n\n{[0109|00ffffff]}Oh, right. You're looking for your\nfriend. You sure have put yourself out\nthere, getting this far...\n\n{[0109|00150d11]}That reminds me!{[0104|000f]} How's MY pal?\n{[0100|ffff]}Gone...{[0101|ffff]}Worried!{[0102|ffff]}No idea.
MT_MZ_11	{[0109|00131007]}Seriously? Can't depend on anybody\nthese days...\n\n\n{[0109|00ff08ff]}Let me take that back. Looks like your\nfriend can count on you, though, right?\nYou've risked life and limb to get here.\n\n{[0109|00141209]}I'm not letting you borrow my bag,\nthough. Nope. I'm GIVING it to you!\nJust don't blow yourself up...
MT_MZ_12	{[0109|00001004]}He's worried? About me?{[0104|000f]} What kind\nof pal am I, putting him through that?\n\n\n{[0109|00ff08ff]}You must be worried too. Not knowing\nif your friend's dead or alive...\n\n\n{[0109|00141209]}I'm not letting you borrow my bag,\nthough. Nope. I'm GIVING it to you!\nJust don't blow yourself up...
MT_MZ_13	{[0109|00000804]}That so? Hmm... {[0104|000f]}I hope he's OK.\nHey...you don't think those monsters\nhave...\n\n{[0109|000008ff]}You must be worried yourself.\nNot knowing if your friend's dead or\nalive or some awful place in between...\n\n{[0109|00141209]}I'm not letting you borrow my bag,\nthough. Nope. I'm GIVING it to you!\nJust don't blow yourself up...
MT_MZ_05	Now you've got my {color[0005]}Bomb Bag{color[ffff]}.\nGo find your friend!
MT_MZ_06	{[0109|00110d12]}Hold up! I forgot to tell you something!\n\n\n\n{[0109|000908ff]}Knowing me, that bag's probably\nempty, so let me give you a little\nsomething to get you started.
MT_MZ_07	If you run out of bombs, just find some\nmore and fill the bag back up.\n\n\n{[0109|0011080b]}When you've got a bomb flower, press\n{color[0004]}{[0204|01cd]} to put it in the bag{color[ffff]}. Don't forget!{[0111|01cd]}\n\n\n{[0109|000908ff]}That bag can {color[0000]}hold up to 10 bombs{color[ffff]}.\nSo if you run across bomb flowers,\nbe sure to fill up the bag.
MT_MZ_08	{[0109|00110d00]}Let me ask you something. You ever\nbeen set on fire when you're fighting\nbad guys?\n\n{[0109|000908ff]}Do yourself a favor and put the fire\nout quick! Oh, and never, EVER pull\nout a {color[0005]}bomb{color[ffff]} when you're covered in\nflames. Trust me on that.
MT_MS_04	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}. It appears\nZelda has cleansed herself in the\nwaters of this fountain.\n\nBased on the information from the\nmessage I just imparted, I project she\nis traveling to a region known as\n{color[0003]}Lanayru{color[ffff]}.\nIf you transport this tablet back to the\nstatue in Skyloft, a new column of\nlight will appear that will allow you to\ntravel to the {color[0003]}Lanayru region{color[ffff]}.\nI suggest you return at once to {color[0003]}Skyloft\n{color[ffff]}and then set out for the Lanayru\nregion.
MT_MS_07	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I detect Zelda's aura in the\nsurrounding area.
MT_MS_08	I detect an especially strong reaction\nfrom this chain. I calculate the\nprobability Zelda was bound by it\nrecently at 95%.
MT_MS_09	I surmise Zelda was somehow able to\nescape and proceed along this path.\nI suggest we continue with all possible\nspeed.
MT_MS_10	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I am detecting new enemies\nahead. They appear to be creatures\nof very significant physical ability.\n\nPress {[0204|07cd]} to{color[0004]} target {color[ffff]}an enemy, then {[0204|11cd]}\nto call me. I will then share any data\nI have on that enemy.{[0111|07cd]}{[0111|09cd]}
MT_GH_00	{[0109|0d0805ff]}Oh, it's you.
MT_GH_08	{[0109|0d0005ff]}Let me see{[0104|0001]}.{[0104|0001]}.{[0104|0001]}.{[0104|0001]} {[0104|0008]}No, that's not it.{[0104|0014]} This is\nso very embarrassing, but I seem to be\nat a loss for your name.\n\n{[0109|0d0a05ff]}Not that it matters, really. To tell you\nthe truth, I'm feeling a bit frustrated,\nand right now I just need someone to\nvent to.
MT_GH_01	{[0109|0d000900]}I heard my underlings had finally\ncaptured the spirit maiden, so of\ncourse I rushed over here. What can I\nsay? I was excited. Flustered, even...\nBut what did I find when I arrived?\n{[0109|0d000cff]}That agent of the goddess...
MT_GH_02	{[0108|fecd]}{[010a|000c00cd]}She had once again...\n\n\n\n{[0109|0d000cff]}{[0108|fecd]}{[0104|000f]}{[010a|000d00cd]}You see, what I'm trying to say is...
MT_GH_03	{[0105|002d0000]}{[0108|02cd]}That goddess-serving dog\n{[010a|000b00cd]}escaped with the girl!
MT_GH_04	{[0108|01cd]}I MUST have the spirit maiden\nin order to resurrect my master!\nI MUST HAVE HER!
MT_GH_05	{[0104|0005]}.{[0104|0005]}.{[0104|0005]}.{[0104|0005]}{[0104|000a]}I got a little carried away there,\ndidn't I? I don’t deal well with...\ncomplications to plans I’ve laid out so\ncarefully. It’s a character flaw of mine.\n{[0109|0d0805ff]}Ah, but something good can still come\nfrom this day! I've had all this bottled-\nup anger smoldering inside me, and\nnow I can release it.
MT_GH_06	{[0109|0d0a05ff]}There's someone special I'd like you to\nmeet. Oh, don't be shy! I need to vent\nall this unhealthy anger, and your\nagony is such a great stress reliever.
MT_GH_07	It won't take more than a few moments\nwith my friend before you're charred\nto a satisfying crisp. And let me tell\nyou, that will put a spring in my step!

ANA_01_01	Do you like money? How about\nexplosions? Well, dig up some Rupees\nbefore you hit a bomb in a suspenseful\ngame of {color[0003]}Thrill Digger{color[ffff]}! Want to try it?\n{[0100|ffff]}Beginner!{[0101|ffff]}Intermediate!{[0102|ffff]}Expert!{[0103|0000]}No, thanks.
ANA_01_02	Hope you dig up lots of Rupees!\nJust be careful what you're poking\ndown in the dirt. Could go KA-BOOM!\nSo uh...good luck!
ANA_01_03	Come back soon!
ANA_01_04	You haven't got enough Rupees.\nSave some up and then come back!
ANA_01_06	Welcome!
ANA_01_07	Hello there! Thanks for stopping by.\nFirst time here, am I right?
ANA_01_07_01	The name's {color[0003]}Tubert{color[ffff]}. Nice to meet you! \nI run this little game I like to call\n{color[0000]}Thrill Digger{color[ffff]}!
ANA_01_08	Here's how it works: you go on and dig\nup ALL the Rupees you can! Well,\nuntil you dig your mitts into a\nspicy little bomb...\nWould you like to... {[0109|00141614]}Oh, I'm sorry,\nbut you don't look so good. Why not\ncome back when you have some\nmore hearts?
ANA_01_16	If you like, use the seat over there\nand take a load off.
ANA_01_09	The Beginner course has less spots to\nburrow into, but it's great for\nfirst-timers!
ANA_01_10	It's {color[0000]}30 Rupees {color[ffff]}to play. Want to give\nit a go?\n{[0100|ffff]}You bet!{[0101|0000]}Nope.
ANA_01_11	The Intermediate course has plenty of\nspots to sink your mitts into, but watch\nout for {color[0005]}Rupoors{color[ffff]}.
ANA_01_12	It'll cost you {color[0000]}50 Rupees {color[ffff]}a go.\nInterested?\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure.{[0101|0000]}Nope.
ANA_01_13	The Expert course has more bombs,\nsure, but more valuable Rupees too.\nIt could be highly profitable...\nor highly explosive.
ANA_01_14	Each round costs {color[0000]}70 Rupees{color[ffff]}. Do you\ndare to try?\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure.{[0101|0000]}Nope.
ANA_01_15	So which course will it be?\n{[0100|ffff]}Beginner.{[0101|ffff]}Intermediate.{[0102|ffff]}Expert.{[0103|0000]}None.
ANA_02_01	You should try again. How about\nanother go?\n{[0100|ffff]}Beginner.{[0101|ffff]}Intermediate.{[0102|ffff]}Expert.{[0103|0000]}I'm done.
ANA_02_02	You didn't dig up even a single Rupee?\nNot a one? You poor little digger...
ANA_02_03	Looks like you took a heavy loss.\nYep. Well, I'm sorry, my friend.
ANA_02_04	You didn't quite turn a profit.\nChalk that up to bad luck, I say.
ANA_02_05	You broke even! No loss. No gain.\nAt least you had yourself some fun, eh?\nAnd you got to see an explosion!
ANA_02_06	You made a small profit. Nice digging!
ANA_02_07	Wow, you made yourself a fortune!\nCongratulations!
ANA_02_08	Well, I'm just stupefied! You dug up all\nthe Rupees! Listen—you earned this\nprize. Take it!
ANA_02_09	Here's your grand Rupee total: {color[0000]}{[0203|0000000000cd]}{color[ffff]}!
ANA_02_13	Let's see how many Rupees you\nmanaged to dig up...
ANA_02_10	Here's a useful tip: {color[0000]}low-value Rupees \n{color[ffff]}have only {color[0000]}a few bad spots {color[ffff]}nearby, \nso you can relax a little.\n\nBut the {color[0000]}higher the value of the Rupee{color[ffff]},\nthe {color[0000]}more bad spots {color[ffff]}are nearby.\nBe careful of the spaces surrounding\na valuable Rupee!\nIf your first burrow digs up a bomb...{[0104|0014]}\nyou'll just have to admit defeat and\ntry again. But don't let it get to you!
ANA_02_11	You look a bit tired out. Why not rest\nup until you get a few hearts back?
ANA_02_12	There's a stool over there. It ain't\nexactly lined with satin pillows, but\ngo ahead and take a load off.
ANA_03_01	Sorry. There's a time limit here,\nand you just hit it. Time's up!
ANA_03_02	I wish you'd hurry up about it.\nYour time's almost up...
ANA_04_01	{[0109|00080a04]}Ah, you're taking a break? Too much\nsuspense for you?\n\n\nWell then, will you take a load off and\nchat with me a bit?{[0100|ffff]}OK.{[0101|0000]}Not now.
ANA_04_02	{[0109|00101319]}Oh...that's too bad. Anyway, once\nyou've rested up, I hope you'll consider\ngiving {color[0003]}Thrill Digger {color[ffff]}a try.
ANA_04_03	{[0109|000f110c]}Oh, yes! OK, OK...is there anything\nyou want to ask me?{[0109|00080aff]}{[0100|ffff]}Who are you?{[0101|ffff]}Are you floating?{[0102|ffff]}Is it too bright for you?{[0103|0000]}Nothing.{[0109|001316ff]}
ANA_04_04	{[0109|00080a04]}My name is {color[0003]}Tubert{color[ffff]}! I run this game I\nlike to call {color[0000]}Thrill Digger{color[ffff]}! Yep, I'm kind\nof important around here.\n\nYou could even call me {color[0003]}Mr. Tubert{color[ffff]}.\nYou know, {[0109|000d0f01]}if you want to. Thanks, kid.\n\n\n{[0109|00080a09]}I want everyone to get their claws on\nplenty of Rupees, so I made up this\n{color[0003]}Thrill Digger{color[ffff]} thing!\n\n{[0109|00101319]}The sad thing is there's been a {color[0000]}scary-\nred-monster{color[ffff]} infestation in these parts\nlately, and it's been bad for business.\nAlmost nobody comes to play!\n{[0109|00080aff]}Some days I wish someone would\njust demolish{[010b|00000004]} those ugly {color[0000]}towers {color[ffff]}with\na bang and send them scampering\naway.
ANA_04_17	{[0109|00080a04]}My name is {color[0003]}Tubert{color[ffff]}! I run this game I\nlike to call {color[0000]}Thrill Digger{color[ffff]}! Yep, I'm kind\nof important around here.\n\nYou could even call me {color[0003]}Mr. Tubert{color[ffff]}.\nYou know, {[0109|000d0f01]}if you want to. Thanks, kid.\n\n\n{[0109|00080a09]}I want everyone to get their hands on\nplenty of Rupees, so I made up this\n{color[0003]}Thrill Digger{color[ffff]} thing!\n\n{[0109|00101319]}The sad thing is all my {color[0003]}Mogma{color[ffff]} friends\nthink Rupees are easy to find. They\nnever come and play...\n\n{[0109|00080aff]}So that's why I need you to step up and\nbecome not just a repeat customer,\nbut my only customer!
ANA_04_05	{[0109|00080a04]}My name is {color[0003]}Tubert{color[ffff]}! I run this game I\nlike to call {color[0000]}Thrill Digger{color[ffff]}! Yep, I'm kind\nof important around here.\n\nYou could even call me {color[0003]}Mr. Tubert{color[ffff]}.\nYou know, {[0109|00090b09]}if you want to. Thanks, kid.
ANA_04_06	{[0109|0014160a]}You mean my glasses? Looking dapper,\neh? The round frames make me\nlook even more fashionable!
ANA_04_13	{[0109|00140e0b]}And I'm plenty proud of my fine\n{color[0000]}mustache{color[ffff]} too! Cute and curly,\nall the way. I groom it every day!\nWait. That rhymed, didn't it?
ANA_04_14	{[0109|00080aff]}But it's only to be expected. I can't have\nmy customers upset by my looks!
ANA_04_07	{[0109|00080a09]}No, it's not too bright. I just wear these\nto look cool.
ANA_04_08	{[0109|00141605]}No, I'm not floating. I'm standing on\nmy tail.
ANA_04_15	{[0109|0000000a]}I don't need to tell you that my {color[0000]}paws\n{color[ffff]}are my best feature. 
ANA_04_16	{[0109|00080aff]}I like to give all my customers a chance\nto admire them. That's why I stand on\nmy tail—it does wonders for sales!
ANA_04_09	{[0109|00080a05]}I'm not floating, no. I just want\ncustomers to see my cute little {color[0000]}paws{color[ffff]},\nso I'm standing on my tail.
ANA_04_10	{[0109|00131806]}So what do you want to ask me next?{[0100|ffff]}Who are you?{[0101|ffff]}Are you floating?{[0102|ffff]}Is it too bright for you?{[0103|0000]}Nothing.
ANA_04_11	{[0109|00101319]}Really? That's a shame. Well, take\na nice break. {color[0003]}Thrill Digger {color[ffff]}is waiting\nfor you whenever you're in the mood\nto poke around for Rupees and bombs!
ANA_04_12	{[0109|00101319]}Really? What a shame...\n\n\n\n{[0109|000d100c]}But thanks for asking all those\ngreat questions! Actually, here,\nlet me tell you something.\n\n{[0109|00080a04]}You see the shining stone sticking out\nof the wall? That's pure {color[0000]}Rupee Ore{color[ffff]}!\nIt's also why there are so many Rupees\nto dig up here.\nIf you sling something at it, it'll {color[0000]}pop\n{color[ffff]}right out.{[010b|00000004]} Go on and give it a try!
ANAHINT_01	Thank you very much for your\nparticipation in {color[0000]}Thrill Digger{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nHere's a helpful tip: {color[0000]}low-value\nRupees {color[ffff]}have only {color[0000]}a few bad\nspots {color[ffff]}nearby, so you can relax a\nlittle.\nBut the {color[0000]}higher the value of the\n{color[ffff]}{color[0000]}Rupee{color[ffff]}, the {color[0000]}more bad spots {color[ffff]}are\nnearby, so watch it.\nSee you again soon!

MT_F2_SARUBO_25	{[0112|00000064]}Hey, Master Shortpants! Since we\ncame all this way, let's play a little\ngame called “protect the robot," bzzrt!\n\nHere's how it works—I'll follow you up\nthe volcano, zzzrt, and you make sure\nnothing touches me. Got it? Good!
MT_F2_SARUBO_26	{[0112|00000064]}Your job is simple, zzrrt! You make\nsure none of these monsters lays a\nclaw on me. NOT...ONE...CLAW!
MT_F2_GORON_00	{[0109|00151b09]}Oh, hey! We meet again. How have you\nbeen, bud?\n\n\nI rumbled over here 'cause I heard\nsomeone had spotted {color[0005]}Goddess Cubes\n{color[ffff]}in the area.\n\nYou may have already found some,\nbut I got a feeling there are some\nothers hidden away around here.\n\n{[0109|001817ff]}You might think about searching for\nthem yourself when you get the time.
MT_F2_GORON_01	I have got a hunch there are still \n{color[0005]}Goddess Cubes {color[ffff]}on this mountain. \nYou should see if you can find them.
MT_F2_GORON_02	{[0109|00151b09]}Oh, hey! We meet again. How have you\nbeen, bud?\n\n\n{[0109|00160bff]}I rumbled over here 'cause I heard\nsomeone had spotted some{color[0005]} Goddess\nCubes {color[ffff]}in the area.\n\n{[0109|00000b00]}I have got a hunch they may be down in\nthat direction, but...this flaming\nwall of fire is blocking the way!
MT_F2_GORON_03	{[0109|00151b09]}Hey! Are you here looking for\n{color[0005]}Goddess Cubes{color[ffff]} too? Nice work getting \npast that hot spot back there, bud.\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}The heat back there did not bother\nme a bit, but these flames right\nhere are another matter.
MT_F2_GORON_04	{[0109|001817ff]}I wish there was something we could do\nto put out these flames...
MT_F2_GORON_05	“Quench my thirst"? Hmm... That\nreminds me. If you head back out of\nhere and turn right, you will end up\noutside.\nI found a {color[0000]}spring {color[ffff]}there. {[010b|00000004]}Let me tell you,\nbud, that water was dee-licious!\n\n\n{[0109|00181705]}No idea how you would bring it in here,\nthough. I doubt those weird-looking\nfrog beasts would carry it for you.\n{[0104|000f]}Got any ideas?
MT_F2_GORON_06	{[0109|00181700]}Well, I know if you head out of here\nand hang a right, you will find this\nnice, refreshing {color[0000]}spring{color[ffff]}, but...\n\nYeah, I am not sure what you should\ndo, to be honest.
MT_F2_GORON_07	{[0109|00171908]}Hey, the flames are out! Now we can\nget through here.
MT_F2_GORON_08	{[0109|00161e56]}More flames... This is starting to burn\nme up...
MT_F2_GORON_09	Hate to ask you this, bud, but could\nyou do the fire-extinguisher routine\nagain?
MT_F2_GORON_10	{[0109|00171908]}Hey! Nice work, bud. Now we are \ngetting somewhere!
MT_F2_GORON_11	Do you see this, bud? Talk about\nintriguing! We are definitely off the\nmap here.\n\n{[0109|00171908]}This does not feel like{color[0005]} Goddess Cube\n{color[ffff]}stuff to me! I bet there is something\n{color[0000]}super important {color[ffff]}hidden around here!
MT_F2_GORON_18	{[0109|00161eff]}All I can say is that is a big frog with\na big thirst. I do not think the amount\nof water one of your little {color[0005]}bottles {color[ffff]}can\nhold is going to cut it this time.
MT_F2_GORON_19	{[0109|00000007]}Hmmm...{[0104|000f]}{[0109|00181700]} You will have to have a{color[0000]} big\ncontainer {color[ffff]}to hold the water needed\nfor this job. {[010b|00000004]}Got anything like that?\n\n{[0109|00161eff]}And speaking of which, where are you\ngoing to get all the{color[0000]} water{color[ffff]}? I gotta\nsay, I am pretty much stumped.
MT_F2_GORON_12	{[0109|00181707]}How are we supposed to give this fellow\nenough {color[0000]}water{color[ffff]}? Whatever it is, it is\ngoing to have to be one{color[0000]} big container{color[ffff]}...\n\n{[0109|00161eff]}You have been adventuring all over the\nplace, right? You got any ideas?
MT_F2_GORON_12_01	{[0109|00181707]}Lots of{color[0000]} water {color[ffff]}and {color[0000]}something to carry it\naround in{color[ffff]}... Any bright ideas on where\nto find those things, bud?
MT_F2_GORON_13	{[0109|00171908]}You are something else, bud! There is\nnothing you cannot do!\n\n\n{[0109|00080bff]}You go ahead on in! You have earned\nthe right to blaze this trail.
MT_F2_GORON_14	{[0109|00181702]}Well, how was it? What did you find?\n{[0100|ffff]}Traps!{[0101|ffff]}Monsters!
MT_F2_GORON_15	{[0109|00161e56]}Is that so? Hmm... Guess I will leave\nthe exploring past here to you, bud.\n\n\n{[0109|00080bff]}By the way, I have got a hunch there is\na {color[0005]}Goddess Cube {color[ffff]}somewhere nearby.\n\n\nAnd my hunches are usually spot on,\nso you should take a good look around.
MT_F2_GORON_16	{[0109|00161e56]}Is that so? Hmm... Guess I will leave\nthe exploring past here to you, bud.\n\n\n{[0109|00080bff]}I am going to head out to another\nlocation and continue my research.\nGive me a holler if you see me again.
MT_F2_GORON_17	I am off to continue my research, bud.\nI am sure I will bump into you again!
MT_F2_MOGUMA_00	{[0109|00110801]}Well, look who we have here! You still\nlooking for your friend?\n\n\n{[0109|000908ff]}Of course, I'm on the hunt for \ntreasure. Heard there were some fancy\nruins out this way...so here I am!\n\n{[0109|00150dff]}Believe it or not, I haven't found a\nthing. Got any information for me?\n{[0100|ffff]}Want to know?{[0101|ffff]}I'm not telling!
MT_F2_MOGUMA_01	{[0109|00110900]}You know something? Spill it!\nWe're friends, right?
MT_F2_MOGUMA_02	{[0109|0014120a]}Don't get all tight lipped on me now!\nWe're friends, right? Out with it!
MT_F2_MOGUMA_03	{[0109|0009080e]}What? There's some fire blocking your\npath? Why don'tcha just pour some\nwater on it and move on?\n\n{[0109|00150800]}Ya need how much water? Whoa...\nI get it. {[0104|0014]}So the water we got here's not\nenough, right?\n\n{[0109|000908ff]}You know, I hear the little water we\ngot here is fed by some far-off water\nsource called {color[0000]}Lake Floria{[010b|00000004]}{color[ffff]}.\n\n{[0109|001108ff]}So a buddy of mine went huntin' for\ntreasure in {color[0003]}Faron Woods{color[ffff]}, and he told\nme he used the waterways there to find\nhis way back home.\n{[0109|000908ff]}He tells me Lake Floria was just about\nthe biggest lake you could imagine. Bet\nif you checked it out, there'd be enough\nwater there to solve your dilemma.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_04	Too bad you came all this way only to\nget stopped dead in your tracks.\nIt's just not your lucky day, bud.\n\n{[0109|00150dff]}Uh...{[0104|0014]}I get the feeling I'm forgetting\nsomething important...\n\n\nI think it's something my buddy told\nme once, but... {[0104|0014]}{[0109|00000004]}Nope, can't remember.\n\n\n{[0109|000908ff]}Oh well, back to the water. If you need\nlots of the wet stuff, you should head\nover to {color[0000]}Lake Floria{color[ffff]}. I think you'll find\nwhat you need.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_05	{[0109|000b0c07]}Oh, you again! It's been a looong time,\nbut I remember that face.\n\n\n{[0109|000b0506]}Heh heh heh. How're those gloves I\ninvented treatin' ya? Are they up to\nyour satisfaction?\n\nHow've I been? Awful nice of ya to ask.\nLemme see...\n\n\n{[0109|000c0405]}I've been searchin' high and low for\nnew treasure, but I've come up empty\npawed.\n\nI gotta say, I'm tired of diggin' after\nmy fortune in this blast furnace.\n\n\n{[0109|00090908]}I'm startin' to think it's time I gave\nup this life of treasure huntin' and\nsettled down to enjoy my twilight\nyears.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_06	{[0109|000c0405]}If I'm going to retire, I want to live in\na place up high with a glorious view.\n\n\n{[0109|000c0dff]}I've lived most of my life underground,\nit's true, but I still gaze up at that sky.\nIt's so...big and blue and fluffy.\n\n{[0109|00090906]}If I had my way, I'd like to come back\nin my next life as a bird and spend my\ntime soaring the wild blue yonder.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_07	{[0109|001b2201]}Whoa there! It's my old pal! How ya\nbeen, old pal?\n\n\nMe? Ah, my claws are sharp, and my\nnose is tuned in to treasure! Yep, I'd\nsay I'm great.\n\n{[0109|00000002]}One thing's got me worried, though.\nSee, our elder, {color[0003]}Guld{color[ffff]}, has been actin'\nkinda odd since going to those ruins.\n\n{[0109|001b230a]}Would ya go and see{color[0003]} Guld{color[ffff]}? He's over\nthataway somewhere, and I know he'd\nbe happy to see your mug.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_08	{[0109|001b050a]}{color[0003]}Guld{color[ffff]}'s wanderin' around over there\nsomewhere. Go see him! Chat with him\na bit, ya know?\n\nIt might cheer him up to see a familiar\nface.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_09	{[0109|001a2001]}Hey, pal, did ya go and visit the elder?\nHow's he doin'?\n\n\n{[0108|01cd]}{[0109|001a2011]}What? Twilight years?\n\n\n\nUh...{[0109|000000ff]}what are ya talkin' about?\nIs “twilight years" some sort of\ncode name for a big treasure?\n\n{[0109|001b1e15]}I gotta tell ya, I've never heard of such\na thing.\n\n\nBut if that's what the elder wants help\nwith, go on and help him out, will ya?
MT_F2_MOGUMA_09_01	{[0109|001b2201]}Whoa! It's my old pal! How've you\nbeen?\n\n\nMe? Ah, my claws are sharp, and my\nnose is tuned in to treasure! I'm great!\n\n\n{[0109|00000002]}One thing's got me worried, though.\nThe tribal elder's been acting odd since\ngoing to those ruins. He's just not\nhimself.\n{[0109|001b22ff]}You talked to him earlier, right?\nHow was he doing?\n\n\n{[0108|01cd]}{[0109|001a2011]}What? Twilight years?\n\n\n\nUh...{[0109|000000ff]}what are you talking about?\nIs “twilight years" some sort of code\nname for treasure?\n\n{[0109|001b1e15]}I gotta tell you, I've never heard of\nsuch a thing. And I know a thing or two\nabout treasure.\n\nBut if that's what the elder wants, help\nhim out, will ya?
MT_F2_MOGUMA_10	{[0109|00000015]}Twilight years, eh? Well, if that's\nwhat the elder wants, help an old\nMogma out, will ya?
MT_F2_MOGUMA_11	{[0109|001c180f]}Wh-wha-what? The elder got...\nlaunched up somewhere?\nWhere'd he go, then?\n{[0100|ffff]}Up in the sky!{[0101|ffff]}Beyond...
MT_F2_MOGUMA_12	{[0109|001a2011]}The sky? Up in the big, blue stuff, eh?\n\n\n\nOh... {[0109|001b0407]}Well, {[0104|0014]}he always was talkin' about\nhow much he loved the sky.\n\n\nI bet he's up there now digging around\nin the clouds for treasure.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_13	{[0109|001a2011]}Beyond?\n\n\n\nUh...{[0109|001b2207]}beyond? {[0104|0014]}Whaddya mean\n“beyond"? Are ya telling me he's\n“gone" gone?\n\nI mean, we all gotta go sometime, \nbut, wow...
MT_F2_MOGUMA_14	{[0109|001a030d]}Elder...I'm gonna do ya proud—just\nwait and see. I hope ya watch over\nme from wherever it is you are now!
MT_F2_MOGUMA_19	{[0109|001a2011]}What do you mean, the elder's back?\n\n\n\n{[0109|001b2207]}Are you saying he can travel between\nhere and the sky? That is one amazing\nguy, I tell you.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_20	{[0109|001b2207]}Traveling back and forth between here\nand the sky. The elder is soooo cool!
MT_F2_MOGUMA_15	{[0109|001a200f]}Hey, it's you! That guy from before...{[0104|000f]}\n\n\n\n{[0109|001b2209]}Heh heh heh... Yeah, that was\npretty embarrassing.\n\n\nWe're all good now, though, because\nmy pal found out about it.\n\n\n{[0109|001b1eff]}Truth is he got captured once too.\nGuess that makes us even. Nothin' for\neither of us to worry about.\n\n{[0109|001a0a12]}Yeah, anyway, you seen {color[0003]}Plats{color[ffff]} around\nanywhere?\n{[0100|ffff]}He was over there.{[0101|ffff]}Nope.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_16	{[0109|001b0a12]}Oh, really? We're all cool, then.\n\n\n\nI just hadn't seen his ugly mug in a\nwhile and, well, you know...\n\n\n{[0109|001b160f]}I thought maybe he'd gone and gotten\nhimself all tied up again.\n\n\n{[0109|001b16ff]}Let me tell ya, that guy's like a\ntrouble magnet!
MT_F2_MOGUMA_17	{[0109|001b2207]}That dirt-brain... {[0104|0014]}I bet he's off on some\nsolo treasure-hunting dig.\n\n\nHe knows he's not supposed to be out\nby himself. This place is dangerous!\n\n\n{[0109|001b0009]}What am I supposed to do, huh?\nI guess that's what you get when you're\n{color[0003]}treasure hunters{color[ffff]}. Bunch of guys who\ndon't know when to quit.\nIf you happen to run into {color[0003]}Plats{color[ffff]}, give\nhim my best, will you?
MT_F2_MOGUMA_18	{[0109|001b2215]}The deal with {color[0003]}Plats {color[ffff]}is he only shows\nsome backbone when he's off\nhunting treasure.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_21	{[0108|01cd]}{[0109|000e1008]}Hey, pal! You're still alive!\n\n\n\n{[0109|0011110b]}And by the looks of it, ya got all your\nloot back too. I knew you had it in ya.\n\n\nSo, uh...{[0104|0014]}did ya find any treasure?\n{[0100|ffff]}Tons!{[0101|ffff]}Not a thing...
MT_F2_MOGUMA_22	{[0109|000e0505]}Seriously? I'm soooo jealous!\n\n\n\n{[0109|000e1f0a]}But the world's a big place, ya know?\nAnd I'm sure there's more treasure\nout there for the swiping.\n\nYeah, I'm not sitting on my tail waiting\nfor it to fall into my lap! You know\nwho's going to find all the loot next\ntime? Me! This guy! That's who!
MT_F2_MOGUMA_23	{[0109|000e040a]}Whaaat? Ya didn't find much of\nanything? Aw, that's too bad, pal.\n\n\n{[0109|000f0508]}Don't get all sad and weepy on me,\nthough. The world's a big place, and\nit's filled with treasure!
MT_F2_MOGUMA_24	{[0109|000d0509]}All right, then. Where's the next place\nto hunt for riches, eh?
MT_F2_MOGUMA_25	{[0109|00000001]}Yo, pal. This your idea of a break\nroom? Battling all them monsters\ngot ya a little run down, huh?\n\n{[0109|00110900]}If those creeps with the {color[0000]}big shields{color[ffff]}\nare as tough as they are ugly, they\nmust be a real pain in the neck.\n\n{[0109|0015080b]}See, I got some{color[0000]} secret information{color[ffff]} that\nI'm sure will make your life easier.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_25_01	{[0109|00ffff09]}Of course, nothing comes for free in\nthis day and age. You're gonna have\nto part with some R-{[0104|000a]}U-{[0104|000a]}P-{[0104|000a]}E-{[0104|000a]}E-{[0104|000a]}S.\nThat spells Rupees, by the way.\nIt's all yours for {color[0000]}30 Rupees{color[ffff]}.\nWhaddya say?\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me! {[0101|0000]}Nah.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_26	{[0109|00141215]}What're you being so stingy for?\nIt's only {color[0000]}30 Rupees{color[ffff]}. \n\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}All right, whatever. Come see me if you\nchange your mind.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_27	{[0109|00141215]}What's the deal, pal? You don't have\nenough Rupees, so you're getting a\nload of nothing from me.\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}Find yourself {color[0000]}30 Rupees{color[ffff]}, then come\nand see me.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_28	{[0109|00110809]}Thank you very much, pal! Listen up!\nThis is for your ears only. Don't go\nsquawking about it with every mug\nyou meet.\n{[0109|00ffff00]}Here's the deal... {[0104|0014]}The shields those\nlugs are carrying around? You can cut\nthem with your sword! What did I tell\nyou? Is that not top-notch info?\nWatch out for the creeps with the tough\niron shields, though—you can't cut\nthem. \n{[0100|ffff]}Got it, thanks! {[0101|ffff]}What? Is that it?
MT_F2_MOGUMA_29	{[0109|0015090b]}Heh heh... And I've got plenty more\ninfo where that came from. You\nknow you want to hear it.\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}You willing to cough up...{[0104|0014]}another\n{color[0000]}30 Rupees{color[ffff]}?\n{[0100|ffff]}You bet! {[0101|0000]}No way.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_30	Yo! What's up with you giving me that\nface? You know, the “I've heard it all\nbefore" face.\n\n{[0109|00150809]}That last tidbit was just the tip of the\niceberg, pal. Not that I ever seen one...\nI got something really juicy here for\nyou. Got another {color[0000]}30 Rupees{color[ffff]} on you?{[0100|ffff]}Yep!{[0101|0000]}Nope.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_31	{[0109|00110808]}I knew there was a reason I liked ya!\nAll right, here goes...\n\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}Those thugs are always trying to skewer\nya with those monster spears, right?\nTake one of those in the gut, and it's\nlights out.\nIf ya time it right, you can{color[0000]} repel {color[ffff]}their\nattacks and...{[0104|000f]}{[0109|00110800]}well, you know what\nhappens after that.{[0104|000f]}\n{[0100|ffff]}Good info!{[0101|ffff]}I knew that.

I put my life on the line\nto get it too.\n\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}And I got more where that came from.\nThis next one's the hidden cherry\non top of the secret sundae. It's only\n{[0104|0014]}{color[0000]}50 Rupees{color[ffff]}.{[0100|ffff]}Gimme!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_33	{[0109|00120e04]}You did? Nice work, pal. You're an\nobservant...uhm...whatever you are.\n\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}Good thing I saved the best for last!\nThis one's a real showstopper, but it\nain't cheap. It'll cost ya {color[0000]}50 Rupees{color[ffff]}!\n{[0100|ffff]}I'm in!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_34	{[0109|0011080b]}Yes! There's not a stingy bone in your\nbody, is there? Truth be told, it makes\nme a bit worried about ya.\n\n{[0109|00141200]}Keep your wits about ya, pal.\nThere are hustlers out there who'll\nfleece ya for every Rupee you've got. 
MT_F2_MOGUMA_34_01	{[0109|00ffff00]}All right, here goes my last secret.\nThose creeps' shields are huge, right?\nLike a wall?\n\n{[0109|00110800]}Well then, treat 'em like a wall and\njab, jab, jab!\n\n\n{[0109|00ffff09]}I'm not going to tell ya what happens,\nbut I highly recommend ya try it.\nI think you'll like the results!\n\n{[0109|00110800]}Go get 'em, pal!

MT_F2_MOGUMA_37	Hey, pal. You still haven't figured out\nthose {color[0000]}mugs with the big shields{color[ffff]}, right?\n\n\n{[0109|0015080b]}I've got one {color[0000]}last bit of secret info {color[ffff]}that\nwill make your life a whole lot easier.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_37_01	You know the drill by now, right?\n{[0109|00ffff09]}It's gonna cost you some R-{[0104|000a]}U-{[0104|000a]}P-{[0104|000a]}E-{[0104|000a]}E-{[0104|000a]}S.{[0104|000a]}\nAnd the price for this is {color[0000]}50 Rupees{color[ffff]}.\n{[0100|ffff]}OK!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_38	{[0109|00110801]}Hey, pal. You bust up those {color[0000]}mugs with\nthe big shields {color[ffff]}yet?\n\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}Here's all you got to remember:\ncut wooden shields, repel spear \nattacks, and clamber up shields like\nthey were walls.\nIf you keep all that in your head, you'll\ndo just fine. I promise!
MT_F2_MOGUMA_39	{[0109|00141215]}What are you getting all stingy for?\nIt's a lousy {color[0000]}50 Rupees{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}Pfft. Whatever. Come see me if you\nchange your mind.
MT_F2_MOGUMA_40	{[0109|00141215]}What are you trying to pull, pal? You\ndon't have enough Rupees!\n\n\n{[0109|00ffff00]}Come back when you've managed to\nscrape together {color[0000]}50 Rupees{color[ffff]}, all right?
MT_F2_HINT_00	Quench my thirst to\nclear your path.
MT_F2_SWORD_00	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I have information for you.\nWith the enhanced capabilities of your\nsword, you are now able to use your\n{color[0000]}dowsing {color[ffff]}ability to find {color[0005]}Goddess Cubes{color[ffff]}. \nI have taken the liberty of registering\n{color[0005]}Goddess Cubes {color[ffff]}as {color[0000]}dowsing {color[ffff]}targets.\n{[010b|00000004]}Please use this ability as you deem\nnecessary.
MT_F2_SWORD_01	The flames blocking your path have\nbeen fully extinguished. I recommend\nproceeding ahead.
MT_F2_SWORD_02	{[0105|004b0000]}{[0112|0000000b]}I have a status update for you, Master.\nWe are now near the crater at the peak\nof {color[0003]}Eldin Volcano{color[ffff]}.
MT_F2_SWORD_03	{[0105|005a0000]}I am detecting extremely high\ntemperatures in this area. However,\nyour{color[0005]} Fireshield Earrings {color[ffff]}will allow for\nextended periods of exploration.
MT_F2_SWORD_04	{[0105|005a0000]}I calculate the probability of finding\nthe final{color[0000]} sacred flame {color[ffff]}here at 90%.\nI recommend searching for flames.
MT_F2_SWORD_05	I am detecting malfunctions within the\nrobot. I recommend repairing it and\ntrying again.
MT_F2_SWORD_06	A report, {[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}.\nI recommend following the {color[0003]}Mogma{color[ffff]}'s\nadvice and returning to {color[0000]}Lake Floria{color[ffff]}.\n\nI also have some advice pertinent to\nthe situation. It concerns a method\nfor transporting water from the lake...{[0104|000f]}\nI suggest you visit the {color[0000]}Water Dragon{color[ffff]}.{[010b|00000004]}\nI conjecture that you can transport\na large volume of water using the {color[0000]}water\nbasin{color[ffff]} that the previously injured\nWater Dragon recuperated in.
MT_F2_SWORD_16	Would you like me to analyze previous\ndata and register the vessel as a\n{color[0000]}dowsing{color[ffff]} target?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes!{[0101|0000]}Not yet.
MT_F2_SWORD_13	{[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}, I have a\nstatus report for you. {[0112|00000001]}The flames that\nimpede your progress have not yet been\nextinguished. \nShall I register the {color[0003]}Water Dragon{color[ffff]}'s\nvessel as a {color[0004]}dowsing {color[ffff]}target?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes!{[0101|0000]}Not yet.
MT_F2_SWORD_14	{[0112|00000005]}Master, I have completed registering\nthe {color[0003]}Water Dragon{color[ffff]}'s vessel as a {color[0004]}dowsing\n{color[ffff]}target.{[010b|00000004]}
MT_F2_SWORD_15	{[0112|00000005]}Understood, Master. I will not proceed\nwith registration.
MT_F2_SWORD_17	We have arrived at Eldin Volcano.\n\n\n\nYou can use your {color[0000]}dowsing{color[ffff]} ability to\nlocate the gate to the trial. You must\npass this trial in order to locate the\nsacred flame.
MT_F2_SWORD_18	Welcome back, {[0112|00000004]}Master.\n\n\n\nI conjecture your newly acquired\n{color[0005]}Fireshield Earrings {color[ffff]}will allow you to\nsafely travel in extremely hot areas.\n\nI recommend continuing your search\nfor the{color[0000]} sacred flame{color[ffff]}.
MT_F2_SWORD_19	{[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}, I detect\nno{color[0000]} water {color[ffff]}in the immediate vicinity.\n\n\nOf course, you will need a large basin\nto proceed past the impediment, but\nyou will also need {color[0000]}water{color[ffff]}. {[010b|00000004]}I recommend\nyou start with that task.
MT_F2_SWORD_20	{[0112|0000000b]}A report, Master {[0200]}.\nThe transport robot is waiting for you\nat the base of the volcano.\n\nI recommend going up into the sky\nagain and returning to the base of\nthe volcano to guide the robot to\nthis location.

MT_Mole2_06	{[0109|331b0a05]}All yours!\n\n\n\nThey've been in a buried treasure\nchest, so they ain't dirty or anything.\n\n\nNow these ain't the kind of thing that\nyou can easily get your hands on just\nanywhere, so take good care of 'em!
MT_Mole2_09	Hey, pal!\n\n\n\nHow are those mitts treatin' ya?\n\n\n{color[0000]}\n{color[ffff]}If you want to get a good look \n{color[0000]}aboveground{color[ffff]}, try pressing {[0204|07cd]}!{[0111|07cd]}\n\n\nGot it?

MT_Mole2_08	{[0109|001b0a02]}Those mitts I gave you were one of\nthe finest pieces in my collection.
MT_Mole2_15	...
MT_Mole2_16	{[0109|001b0a09]}Heyyy! We meet again!\n\n\n\nHeh heh heh... Sorry, but I kinda\nhappened to overhear that\nconversation.\n\nIt seems one of my guys was giving ya\na hard time.

MT_Mole2_17	{[0109|001b0a02]}This room has a {color[0000]}fake wall{color[ffff]} somewhere...\n\n\n\nAnd on the other side of that wall,\nthere's another room. Or so I hear...\n\n\n{[0109|001b1e0a]}The ground underneath us is full of\nmonsters, so we don't go tunneling\ntoo much down there, but...\n\n{[010b|00000004]}If you're feelin' adventurous, there\njust might be a {color[0000]}hidden route{color[ffff]}...
MT_Mole2_18	{[0109|001b0a09]}Did you get that from one of ours?\nDon't you worry. I won't try to take it\nfrom ya.\n\n{[0109|001b0a02]}I'm tellin' ya, the information in that\nbox... I think it'll definitely be useful.
MT_Mole2_19	{[0109|001b1a15]}Wow, you just took down the wall!\nYou got some starch in your socks,\npal!
MT_Mole2_21	{[0109|001b0a01]}Me? I'm going to explore this room a\nlittle more.\n\n\nI also need to report to the boss for\nthat guy who ran off.
MT_Mole3_02	{[0109|331a1a0b]}Ahhh! So busy, so busy... Burning the\nmidnight oil again looking for loot!

MT_FIRE_DORAGON_01	{[0109|00000701]}Yes... You appear as if summoned!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00000700]}Young hero, do you wish to ask a\nquestion of me?\n{[0100|ffff]}{color[0003]}Water Dragon{color[ffff]}?{[0101|ffff]}{color[0003]}Thunder Dragon{color[ffff]}?{[0102|ffff]}Volcano?{[0103|0000]}No, thanks.
MT_FIRE_DORAGON_02	{[0109|00070702]}Yes... The {color[0003]}Water Dragon{color[ffff]}. You see,\nthe goddess gave the Water Dragon\nthe power to protect the woods.\n\n{[0109|00000700]}That power is strong, but the will of the\ndragon is even stronger. ...You may\nwant to be careful with that one, lest\nyou be eaten like an appetizer.\n{[0109|00000703]}Ha ha ha ha!
MT_FIRE_DORAGON_03	{[0109|00070702]}Yes, yes... The {color[0003]}Thunder Dragon{color[ffff]}.\nThe goddess gave the Thunder Dragon\nthe power to protect the desert.\n\nThis dragon possesses a {color[0000]}legendary\nshield{color[ffff]}. It is truly one of its most prized\ntreasures.\n\n{[0109|00000700]}It is said that the Thunder Dragon\ndelights in testing those with promise\nin the hopes of someday finding a\nworthy recipient for the shield.\nBut the dragon is a wily one. And his\ntest is not as simple as it may appear!\n\n\n{[0109|00000003]}Ha ha ha ha!
MT_FIRE_DORAGON_04	{[0109|00070702]}Yes... This mountain was not always\nsuch a dangerous and unforgiving\nplace.\n\n{[0109|00000700]}There was a time when those above-\nground and those below lived together\nin harmony by the blessing of the\ngreat mountain.\n{[0109|00000700]}The desolation that you see now is all\nthat remains to remind us of those\nglorious days...
MT_FIRE_DORAGON_05	{[0109|00000702]}Yes... You see the path before you,\nthen. Go. Follow it.
MT_FIRE_DORAGON_06	{[0109|00000700]}What is this? You have another\nquestion for me?\n{[0100|ffff]}{color[0003]}Water Dragon{color[ffff]}?{[0101|ffff]}{color[0003]}Thunder Dragon{color[ffff]}?{[0102|ffff]}Volcano?{[0103|0000]}Not really.
MT_MOLE_DEMO_01	{[0109|00000010]}Ta-DAH! I'm here to save the day!
MT_MOLE_DEMO_02	{[0109|000f0f08]}Heyyyy! Long time no see!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00000e00]}Huh? Don't tell me ya forgot my ugly\nmug!\n\n\n{[0109|000e0e00]}I'm Plats, the Mogma you helped \nin the northern temple!\n\n\n{[0109|000e0e00]}I saw them draggin' you off\nunconscious, so I tailed 'em!
MT_MOLE_DEMO_03	{[0109|000d0e0a]}You're pretty fearless, eh?\nWhat are you up to now?\n{[0100|ffff]}Well...{[0101|ffff]}Searching.
MT_MOLE_DEMO_04	{[0109|000e0e05]}Th-the dragon? You mean the\ndragon-god thing?\n\n\nUhh, yeah... I heard a rumor that a big\ndragon-god lives in this mountain...\n\n\n{[0109|000f210a]}You really like those fantasy stories,\neh, pal?\n\n\n{[0109|000d0000]}Hmm? Why am I here, you ask?\n\n\n\n{[0109|000e0e0b]}I just heard a rumor that some bad\nguys were gettin' together on this\nmountain!\n\nHeh heh heh... And everyone knows\nthat when bad guys get together,\nthey'll be fightin' over some loot.
MT_MOLE_DEMO_05	{[0109|000f0f0b]}...Haha! I know why you're really here!\nYou heard the rumor about the baddies\nand their treasure too, didn't ya, pal?\n\n{[0109|000e0e00]}Heh heh heh! You know what I'm\ntalkin' about! The rumor that some\nbad guys are havin' a little get-\ntogether on this mountain.\n{[0109|000f0e00]}And everybody knows that where\nthere's bad guys, there's treasure!\nThat's just the way of the world.
MT_MOLE_DEMO_06	{[0109|000e0e09]}Don't you gotta take care of your own\nbusiness first?\n\n\nHaven't ya noticed? They swiped all\nyour stuff!\n\n\n{[0109|000f0f0a]}While you were out, they shook you\ndown good, pal! You're gonna want to\nget your stuff back before ya go and\ntry anything else.\n{[0109|000e0e00]}I can get you started. I stole these back\nfor ya...
MT_MOLE_DEMO_07	{[0109|0011110b]}Time for me to tunnel out, pal!\nYou got your work cut out for you!\n\n\n{[0109|000f0e00]}Good luck out there!
MT_MOLE_HINT_00	{[0109|00000001]}Heyyyy!
MT_MOLE_HINT_01	{[0109|000f0e00]}Whaddya thinkin'? You shouldn't be\nout here in the open with no way to\ndefend yourself...\n\nThis place is crawlin' with thugs!\n\n\n\n{[0109|000e0e03]}Well, just be careful they don't spot\nya while you're sneakin' around!
MT_MOLE_HINT_02	{[0109|0011110b]}I feel just terrible for you, pal...\nHere, let me do one more thing for ya!\nOl' Plats here's gonna show ya what's\nin all the treasure chests!\n...Ta-dahh!
MT_MOLE_HINT_03	{[0109|000e0e09]}After all, none of it looked like stuff\nI'd really want anyhow...\n\n\n{[0109|000f0e00]}But if some of them things are yours,\nI'll bet you're gonna want to get 'em\nback, right?
MT_MOLE_HINT_04	{[0109|0000000a]}And I probably don't even need to say\nthis again... But seriously, pal, don't\nlet them bad guys see ya, y'hear?\n\n{[0109|000f0e00]}They ain't gonna do nothin' nice if they\ncatch you! So don't do anything heroic\nand get yourself caught!\n\nGot it?\n{[0100|ffff]}OK, already...{[0101|ffff]}...
MT_MOLE_HINT_05	{[0109|000e0e0b]}All right then, I'm going back to\nrummage around for treasure!\n\n\nSee ya later!
MT_MOLE_HINT_06	...\n\n\n\n{[0109|000f0e06]}Ahh... You know, I really worry about\nya, pal. It's a weakness of mine!\n\n\n{[0109|000e0e00]}OK, tell you what...I'm gonna show you\nsomething good! Open up your map!
MT_MOLE_HINT2_00	Wheeeeeeze... So hot...\n\n\n\nOne of the most amazing treasures\nof the world, just up ahead...
MT_MOLE_HINT2_01	Huff...\n\n\n\nA little while ago, all them bad guys\nstarted disappearing... Then I noticed\nthey were all gathering up ahead...\nThey must have something good...
MT_CK_00	Pst! Hey, boy oh boy, have I got some\ngreat hints for you. Want to see one?\n{[0100|ffff]}Show me!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
MT_CK_01	Hey there, friend. Do you want a hint?\nI've got new ones to show!\n{[0100|ffff]}Show me!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.

MT_SIREN_01	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}...
MT_SIREN_02	You stand within {color[0003]}Din's Silent Realm{color[ffff]},\nthe third trial. It will test the limits of\nyour {color[0000]}power{color[ffff]}.\n\nTo locate the last flame that will\nenhance your sword, you must first\ncomplete this final challenge and\nachieve spiritual growth once again.
MT_SIREN_04	When your vessel is full, your spirit\nwill grow and you will be entrusted\nwith a {color[0000]}new power {color[ffff]}by the goddess.\n\nDo you have any questions?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes!{[0101|0000]}No.
MT_SIREN_25	Which topic do you wish to review?\n\n\n{[0100|ffff]}The {[0201|0011]}?{[0101|ffff]}Guardians?{[0102|ffff]}Waking Water?{[0103|0000]}Never mind.
MT_SIREN_26	Do you have any further questions?\n\n{[0100|ffff]}The {[0201|0011]}?{[0101|ffff]}Guardians?{[0102|ffff]}Waking Water?{[0103|0000]}Never mind.
MT_SIREN_28	Understood, {[0112|00000005]}Master.
MT_SIREN_03	{[0112|00000002]}Master, I await your return in the\noutside world.
MT_SIREN_05	Yes, {[0112|00000005]}Master.\n\n\n\nTo fill the {color[0005]}{[0201|0011]}{color[ffff]}, you need to\nlocate and collect every {color[0005]}{[0201|002c]} \n{color[ffff]}scattered across this Silent Realm.
MT_SIREN_15	{[0112|00000002]}Master, do you see the glowing\nobject a ways in front of you?
MT_SIREN_16	That is a {color[0005]}{[0201|002c]}{color[ffff]}.\nYou will need to collect {color[0000]}15 {color[ffff]}of them.
MT_SIREN_07	{[0112|00000005]}Understood, Master.\nAllow me to explain.
MT_SIREN_17	If you take even a single step outside\nthe protective circle you stand in, the\n{color[0000]}Guardians {color[ffff]}of this realm will wake up\nand pursue you, {[0112|00000002]}Master.
MT_SIREN_18	If a {color[0000]}Guardian {color[ffff]}manages to land even a\nsingle hit on you, your spirit will\nshatter and you will fail the trial.
MT_SIREN_19	You must collect the {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]} scattered\nthroughout this area and fill the\n{color[0005]}{[0201|0011]} {color[ffff]}without\nbeing hit by an attack.
MT_SIREN_27	The unusual liquid substance that\ncovers that area is known as {color[0000]}Waking\nWater{color[ffff]}, and it has certain unique\nproperties.\nIf you make contact with Waking\nWater, the {color[0000]}Guardians will be\nimmediately alerted to your presence{color[ffff]}.\n\nPools of Waking Water are located all\nthroughout the area. I suggest you\nwatch where you step...
MT_SIREN_10	When your {color[0005]}{[0201|0011]}{color[ffff]} is filled with\n15 {color[0000]}tears{color[ffff]}, your spirit will grow and you\nwill be blessed by the goddess with a\nnew power.\n{[0112|00000002]}Master, I will await your return in the\noutside world.
MT_SIREN_20	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, I can\nunfortunately confirm that you\nhave failed to pass the trial.
MT_SIREN_22	Collect all the {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]} within the Silent\nRealm. I shall await your return here.
MT_SIREN_11	{[0112|00000002]}Master, so long as you have the will and\ndetermination, you can retry a trial\nas many times as you like.\n\nA good strategy is {color[0000]}to find, but then\ndeliberately not pick up{color[ffff]}, the most-\neasily-accessible {color[0005]}{color[0005]}tears{color[0005]} {color[ffff]}until you are\ndiscovered and really need one.\nCollect the 15 {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]} and complete the\ntrial. I will await your return in the\noutside world.
MT_SIREN_12	The locations of {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]} you have\ngathered during your trial are\n{color[0000]}marked on the map{color[ffff]}.\n\nYou will have an easier time\ncompleting your task if you\nfirst set out to discover the\nlocations of all 15 tears.
MT_SIREN_21	{color[0000]}Two types of Watchers {color[ffff]}patrol the\nrealm, looking for intruders. I highly\nsuggest you take caution.\n\nSo long as you do not step into their\nlight, you will remain undetected\nby {color[0000]}flying Sky Watchers{color[ffff]}.\n\nHowever, the {color[0000]}Earth Watchers{color[ffff]}, who\n{color[0000]}hover near the ground{color[ffff]}, will give chase\nif you come too close to them, so {color[0000]}stay\nalert {color[ffff]}and maintain a safe distance.
MT_SIREN_13	{[0112|00000001]}Master, the chances of your not being\nthe chosen one are increasing...\n\n\nRepeated attempts at this trial have\nscattered your concentration and made\nyour performance erratic. I suggest\nyou rest awhile before trying again.
MT_SIREN_14	I suggest using smart tactics to your\nadvantage. Try {color[0000]}leaving easy-to-collect\ntears {color[ffff]}for when you are being pursued.
MT_SIREN_23	The locations of {color[0005]}tears {color[ffff]}that you have\npreviously collected will be {color[0000]}marked\non the map{color[ffff]}, so make good use of that.\n\nConfirm the locations of all 15 tears\nfirst to increase your chances of\nsuccessfully completing the trial.
MT_SIREN_24	{[0112|00000001]}Master, in addition to the {color[0000]}Guardians{color[ffff]}\nwho will attack you, there are also two\ntypes of {color[0000]}Watchers {color[ffff]}that search for\nintruders {color[0000]}on the ground and in the sky{color[ffff]}.\nThe two types of Watchers exhibit\ndramatically different behavior, so be\nsure you understand how to avoid\ndetection by both.
RAIRYU_MT_SIREN_00	We're here, {[0200]}!\nShow me what you've got!
3-Mountain\351-Salvage.msbt
SAL351_01	I have located a substance that closely\nresembles the material used in the\nfortune-teller's crystal ball... It should\nmake a suitable replacement.\nShall I call the robot to collect it?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes.{[0101|0000]}Not now.
SAL351_02	Yes, {[0112|00000005]}Master. If you change your mind\nand decide to pursue this matter, please\nexamine it again.
SAL351_03	{[0112|00000005]}Master, I will send word to the robot\nusing telepathic transmission.
SAL351_04	{[0112|00000064]}Mistress Fi! I'm heeeeereeeee, zrrpt!\n\n\n\nOh. You want me to carry this, bzzt?
SAL351_05	{[0112|00000064]}I'll be waiting for you in the sky,\nso don't take too long, vrrt!!
SAL351_06	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I suggest we also return to\nthe sky and collect the crystal ball as\nsoon as possible.
SAL351_07	{[0112|00000064]}Hey, Master Shortpants! How come\nyou always get the easy jobs, zrrpt?
SAL351_10	{[0109|00000009]}So we meet again, eh? I gotta thank ya\nfor your help last time!\n\n\nSee, I've been searchin' for new\ntreasure spots, but I can't find a\nsingle bauble or bit of treasure.\n\nMaybe I'm just gettin' woozy from\nworking so long in this heat.\n\n\n{[0109|00000005]}Sometimes I wish I could find a job that\nreally played to my strengths, yeah...\nsomethin' in a cool climate. Then I'd\nbe set!\n{[0100|ffff]}I know a place!{[0101|ffff]}Keep dreaming.
SAL351_10_01	{[0109|00000004]}So ya know a place with work that I'd\nbe good at?\n\n\nAnd it's in the sky?!\n...\n...\nI LOVE THE SKY!\nWhere do I sign up?{[0104|000a]} I'm tellin' ya,\nI'm in! Let's do this thing!{[0104|000a]}
SAL351_10_02	{[0109|00000008]}Right...{[0104|000a]} Well, yeah, I guess I could try\nto stick it out for a little while longer...
SAL351_10_03	This individual's capabilities match\nperfectly to the types of duties\nexpected of an employee at the Lumpy\nPumpkin.\nDo you want to call the robot and\ntransport this individual?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes.{[0101|0000]}No.
SAL351_10_04	{[0109|00000004]}Hey, what gives?! You said you'd take\nme to the sky, but then you backed out\nof our deal! Now I'm back here.\n\nIf you're going to make a promise\nlike that, you better follow through!
SAL351_11	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I suggest that we also return\nto the sky and accompany the Mogma\nto his destination quickly.
SAL351_12	{[0112|00000064]}You don't have to tell me twice, zrrbt!

Demo29_01:01	{[0301]}{[0200]}!
Demo29_01:02	You cannot go to him, Your Grace.\nRemember what we discussed.\nRestrain yourself. Focus on the task\nat hand.
Demo29_01:03	I... I have to go. I'm sorry,\n{[0200]}.
Demo29_01:04	It took you far too long to get here.\nLooking at you, I fear the {color[0003]}goddess\n{color[ffff]}is mistaken in her choice of agents.\n\nIf this failure is any indication, you\nhave no hope of defending Her Grace\nfrom those who seek to assail her.
Demo29_01:05	Do my words anger you, boy?\n\n\n\nDo my words sting?{[0104|0005]} Let them. {[0104|000f]}If I had\nnot come when I did, your Zelda would\nalready have fallen into the hands of\nthe enemy.\n{[0104|0014]}{[0106|ffcd]}The truth of it is you were late.\n{[0106|ffcd]}You were late, and you failed to\nprotect her.
Demo29_01:06	I sent Zelda ahead to learn more of the\nfate in which she is destined to play\na part.\n\nListen well, chosen one. If you wish to\nbe of help to Her Grace, you must\nsummon a shred of courage and face\nthe trials laid out before you.\nOnly when you've conquered the trials\nwill you be of use to Zelda. {[0104|000a]}No sooner.\n{[0104|000a]}Am I understood?
Demo31_01:01	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I have a message written in the\nlanguage of the gods of old.\n\n\nAllow me to translate for you.
Demo31_01:02	{color[0002]}From the edge of time I guide you,\nthe one destined to carry out the\ngoddess's mission.{color[ffff]}
Demo31_01:03	{color[0002]}The spirit maiden who descended from\nthe clouds has passed through the\nEarth Spring and makes her way to a\nfated place.{color[ffff]}
Demo31_01:04	{color[0002]}The parched desert of Lanayru...{color[ffff]}{color[0002]}\nThat is where the chosen will pass\nthrough the {color[0000]}Gate of Time {color[0002]}into a\ndistant world.{color[ffff]}
Demo31_01:05	You got the {color[0005]}Amber Tablet{color[ffff]}! \nThe weathered surface of this heavy stone\ntablet feels very old.
Demo51_01:01	...Oh, hello there, {[0200]}.\nI see you're still among the living.\nFancy meeting you here.
Demo51_01:02	We seem to bump into each other time\nand time again. Oh, it's no coincidence,\nthough, is it? You and I, we're bound\nby a {color[0000]}thread of fate{color[ffff]}.
Demo51_01:03	Look at these old drawings!
Demo51_01:04	Until I found these, I was...upset about\nthat little stunt the goddess's guard dog\npulled at the {color[0000]}Gate of Time{color[ffff]}. What was\nthat twig's name again? {color[0003]}Impa{color[ffff]}?
Demo51_01:05	Well, never mind that, because these\ndrawings suggest the existence of a\nsecond Gate of Time.{[0104|001e]} This news has \njust {[0106|01cd]}filled my heart with rainbows!{[0106|00cd]}
Demo51_01:06	I've been a busy boy, searching here\nand there and everywhere for another\nGate of Time.
Demo51_01:07	And yet, I couldn't even find a single\nclue. Since I know I can be honest with\nyou, I'll admit I got a little sulky.\nIt was frowns all around.
Demo51_01:08	The thought of never getting my hands\non that darling young girl again was...\nwell, more than I could bear.
Demo51_01:09	But then...{[0104|0028]} Then I found this place!{[0104|0028]}\nThe prospect of a second Gate of Time\nhas made me positively giggly!
Demo51_01:12	That girl... Your adorable friend...\nShe will be instrumental in bringing\nabout the revival of my master.\n\nAnd though I feared she was now quite\nbeyond my reach, I despair no longer!
Demo51_01:13	...But before we talk any further on \nthat subject, there's still the\noutstanding matter of your\npunishment, {[0200]}.\nDo you remember when I told you that\nthe next time we met, I'd make your\nears bleed from the sound of your own\nscreams?\nWell, I've been thinking... Perhaps\ncorporal punishment is a touch harsh.\nI might be willing to forgive and forget\nif you'll strike a deal.
Demo51_01:14	...{[0104|000f]}All I ask is that you tell me where\nI can find the other Gate of Time.\n\n\nThat's not too much to ask, is it?\nOh, and don't you play coy with me.\nI know that you know, so why not let me\nin on the fun?
Demo51_01:15	Such behavior. A mischievous boy like\nyou needs to be dealt with firmly. \nI must warn you, I won't go easy on you\nthis time.
Demo51_01:16	Lovely, aren't they? You'll find the\nsupple skin of my arms tougher than\nany armor. Doesn't their shape just\nleave you...breathless?
Demo51_01:17	{[0105|000a0000]}Behold!
Demo51_01:18	{[0105|00140000]}Such beauty!
Demo51_01:19	{[0105|00140000]}{[0108|01cd]}Such a pure form!
Demo51_01:20	{[0105|00140000]}{[0108|01cd]}Such an exquisite physique!
Demo51_01:21	{[0105|00190000]}{[0108|02cd]}Such stunning features!
Demo51_01:22	Yes, I've pretty much got it all. {[0104|0014]}Though\nthere is one teensy, tiny thing I lack...
Demo51_01:23	Namely, mercy.{[0104|002d]}\n\n\n\nCome to me, {[0200]}.\nYou and I, we're bound by that {color[0000]}thread{color[ffff]}\nof fate. Destined to fight.\n\n{[0104|003c]}So come close, {[0200]}!{[0106|ffcd]}\nMeet me in battle, and the thread of\nfate that binds us will be soaked \ncrimson with your {color[0000]}blood{color[ffff]}!
Demo52_01:02	The flames of Din have imbued your\nblade with a sacred white light that\ndemons revile.
Demo52_01:03	{[0112|00000001]}Master, {[0104|000f]}now that it has been tempered\nby the last of the sacred flames, your\nblade has finally revealed its true\nform. You now hold the {color[0000]}Master Sword{color[ffff]}.
Demo52_01:04	With this sword's great power, you can\nawaken the Gate of Time within the\n{color[0003]}Sealed Temple{color[ffff]}. I recommend you\nmake your way to this location.
Demo64_01:01	Ho! A man of flesh and blood has\nwalked his way to the heart of my\nburning hall! Now this is something.

DS_ROBO_I_02_d	That was scary, vrrrrrm...\nThanks for helping me, bzzt.
DS_ROBO_I_02_e	This map... It looks inaccurate, bzzt.\nI'm going to fix it for you, zrrm!
DS_ROBO_J_01	...
DS_ROBO_J_02	You are not in my memory banks, brrt.\n\n\n\n{[0109|13030000]}This is the power generator for the\nmechanism that opens the entrance\nto Lanayru Mining Facility, zrrpt!\n\n{[0109|13030000]}But it won't budge until you activate\nthe remote power nodes and set those\n{color[0000]}three dials{color[ffff]} to access them correctly.
DS_ROBO_J_02_a	Did you figure out how to access the\nremote power nodes, zrrpt? Just\nsetting the dials will not be enough to\nopen the entrance to the facility, vrrm.
DS_ROBO_J_02_b	Did you figure out how to access the\nremote power nodes, zrrbt? That is\nmost impressive...for a human, vrrm.\n\n{[0109|13030000]}This is {color[0003]}Lanayru Mining Facility{color[ffff]},\nphwing!

DS_ROBO_K_03	Ahhh! What are you doing, vrrt?!\n\n\n\n{[0109|13030000]}Still... You'll never get it to open just\nfiddling with the dials, bzzt.

DS_ROBO_O_02	These strange things have started\nattacking us recently, vrrm. We don't\nhave any weapons to defend ourselves,\nso if they attack, we're fried, phweep!
DS_ROBO_P_01	...

DS_SWORD_01_a	{[0105|005a0000]}{[0112|0000000b]}A report, Master {[0200]}.\nWe have arrived at {color[0003]}Lanayru Mine{color[ffff]}.
DS_SWORD_01_b	{[0105|005a0000]}This arid region was transformed into\na desert over the course of several\nhundred years.
DS_SWORD_01_c	{[0105|005a0000]}My projections show that {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} must\nhave traveled through this area.
DS_SWORD_02	My estimates indicate that this object\nhas been broken for many years.\nI am unable to analyze the content of\nits speech at this time.
DS_SWORD_02_a	I am able to confirm that a time shift\nhas occurred within this space.\n\n\nAny impact to the blue stones creates a\nsustained temporal disruption field in\nthe surrounding area. Readings show\nthat this area {color[0000]}{[010b|00000004]}is in a past time state{color[ffff]}.
DS_SWORD_04	Readings indicate the materials used \nto construct the {color[0003]}generator{color[ffff]} are also \npresent in this area. You can now use \nyour {[010b|00000004]}{color[0000]}dowsing{color[ffff]} ability to locate them.
DS_SWORD_05	A report, {[0112|00000001]}Master. I can no longer\ndetect {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}'s aura.
DS_SWORD_05_2	The moment the gate was destroyed,\nZelda's presence disappeared from my\nreadings. {[010b|00000004]}{color[0000]}You can no longer search for\nher with your dowsing ability{color[ffff]}.
DS_SWORD_05_3	Zelda's companion instructed you to\nmeet with the ancient one in the Sealed\nGrounds.\n\nThis corresponds with the records in\nmy memory. I propose that we travel to\nthe {color[0003]}Sealed Temple{color[ffff]}.
DS_SWORD_06_a	{color[0003]}{[0105|005a0000]}{color[ffff]}We have arrived at {color[0003]}Lanayru Deser{color[ffff]}{color[0003]}t{color[ffff]}.\nThe terrain in this area changed\ndramatically as climate forces rapidly\nturned it into a desert.
DS_SWORD_06_b	{[0105|005a0000]}I have confirmed numerous areas of\n{color[0000]}sinksand{color[ffff]}. Should you step in sinksand,\nyou may be swallowed by the desert.\nBodily danger has increased by 30%.
DS_SWORD_06_c	{[0105|005a0000]}As a safety measure, I recommend\nyou {color[0000]}{[010b|00000004]}check the terrain{color[ffff]} on your map\nwith {[0204|02cd]}. {[0111|02cd]}
DS_SWORD_06_d	{[0105|005a0000]}My readings indicate that {color[0003]}Zelda {color[ffff]}has\npassed through here. As previously\nstated, this area is highly dangerous.\n\n{color[0003]}{[0105|005a0000]}{color[ffff]}I suggest reuniting with her quickly\nto determine the motivations behind\nher actions at {color[0003]}Eldin{color[ffff]} {color[0003]}Province{color[ffff]}.
DS_SWORD_08	{[0112|0000000b]}A report, Master {[0200]}.\n\n\n\nThe map you possess corresponds to the\nactual terrain of this area with only\n35% accuracy.\n\nThe robot you met earlier modified\nyour map to show {color[0000]}past terrain{color[ffff]}{[010b|00000004]} that is\nnow submerged below the sinksand.
DS_SWORD_08_2	{[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}, I have\ninformation to report.\n\n\nI can confirm that you will not be\nconsumed by the sinksand in this\ncurrent position. I suggest verifying\nyour location on the map.
DS_SWORD_08_3	Readings indicate that there is a\nsubmerged path beneath the\nsinksand.\n\nIt is possible to walk along a route\nabove this path without submerging\ncompletely into the sinksand.\n\nSimulations suggest that placing\nbeacons to mark a safe route along\nthese paths before proceeding would\nsignificantly reduce risk.
DS_SWORD_08_4	I recommend placing {color[0003]}multiple{color[ffff]}{[010b|00000004]} beacons.
DS_SWORD_10	We have arrived at {color[0003]}Lanayru Mine{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n\nYou can use your dowsing ability to\nlocate the entrance to the trial you\nmust pass to open the way to the\nsacred flame.
DS_SWORD_11	We have arrived at {color[0003]}Lanayru Desert{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n\nYou can use your dowsing ability to\nlocate the entrance to the trial you\nmust pass to open the way to the \nsacred flame.
DS_SWORD_12	We have arrived at the {color[0003]}Temple of\nTime{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nYou can use your dowsing ability to\nlocate the entrance to the trial you\nmust pass to open the way to the\nsacred flame.
DS_SWORD_13	Congratulations, {[0112|00000004]}Master.
DS_SWORD_14	{[0112|00000001]}You have completed the trial. You now\nhave the power to proceed to the sacred\nflame that will be entrusted to your\nsword and your strong spirit.
DS_SWORD_15	The {color[0005]}{[0201|0014]} {color[ffff]}are one of the goddess's\nsacred gifts.\n\n\nYou can extend these claws attached to\nchains to pull yourself to {color[0000]}targets {color[ffff]}and\n{color[0000]}vines{color[ffff]} beyond your reach.
DS_SWORD_16	The flame is somewhere in the desert...\nI conjecture that it lies in a place\nyou have not yet visited, {[0112|00000001]}Master.
DS_SWORD_17	A report, {[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}.
DS_SWORD_17_2	The symbols on this power generator\ncorrespond to the symbols on the three\nremote power nodes you activated.\nLogic suggests that they are connected.
DS_SWORD_18	{[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}, all three\nremote power nodes have been\nactivated.\n\nPlease make your way to the {color[0000]}power\ngenerator {color[ffff]}in front of {color[0003]}Lanayru\nMining Facility{color[ffff]}.
DS_SWORD_19	A report, {[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}.\nMy analysis indicates that you can\nrestore this {color[0000]}device{color[ffff]} to an operable state\nby inserting a source of energy.
DS_SWORD_20	{color[0003]}Tumbleweeds{color[ffff]} sometimes roll across the\nsand in Lanayru Desert and other\nplaces.\n\nTumbleweeds are used as a material to \nupgrade a variety of items. You can\ncollect them with a{color[0000]} Bug Net{color[ffff]}.
DS_GORO_D_01	{[0109|2f080d02]}Hello, hello, {[0200]}.
DS_GORO_D_02	{[0109|00080d00]}I just remembered, {[0200]}.\nI have got something to report on the\nexcavation project you invested in\nearlier!{[0104|0014]}\nI found loads of Timeshift Stones!\n{[0109|2f000d01]}Now I can pay you back 10 times what\nyou gave me!
DS_GORO_D_03	How is your search for that {color[0003]}sacred\nflame {color[ffff]}going? Did you find it?!\n\n\nI have been dying to hear whether you\nfound it. Well...did you?\n\n\n{[0109|2f080407]}.{[0104|0014]}.{[0104|0014]}.{[0104|0014]}So after that wild, long adventure,\nyou found it! {[0301]}{[0200]}, you\nare truly amazing.
DS_GORO_D_03_2	{[0109|2f080d0a]}You know, I think it is time I tell you\nwhat I found out about the legend of\nthe three dragons.{[0104|000f]}\n\nI am certain there is a hidden area just\nbeyond here in the desert!\n\n\nYou see, I found a {color[0000]}narrow passageway{color[ffff]}{[010b|00000004]}\nthat was too tight for me to fit through.\n\n\n{[0109|2f000d00]}And my gut tells me that one of the\nthree dragons of legend, the {color[0000]}Thunder\nDragon{color[ffff]}, lives there!\n\n{[0109|2f000800]}These robots are connected to him\nsomehow. I am sure of it, bud.{[0104|000f]}\n\n\n{color[0000]}{[0109|2f010807]}{[0106|ffcd]}The T{color[ffff]}{color[0000]}hunder Dragon{color[ffff]}, robots, and\nTimeshift Stones{[0104|0014]}.{[0104|0014]}.{[0104|0014]}.{[0104|0014]}\n\n\n{[0109|2f080708]}{[0108|02cd]}{[0108|02cd]}What an adventure!
DS_GORO_D_04	{[0109|2f080d0a]}I found the passage that leads\nto where the {color[0000]}Thunder Dragon{color[ffff]} lives...{[0104|002d]}\n\n\n{[0106|ffcd]}{[0109|2f0d0800]}But it is too narrow for a big guy like\nme to pass through. {[0106|ffcd]}{[0109|2f080700]}If only there was a\nway...
DS_GORO_D_05	{[0109|2f0c0d01]}{[0106|ffcd]}{[0108|01cd]}{[0109|2f000001]}Hey, you over there! Say, is that\nmy buddy {[0200]}?\nIt is!\n\n{[0106|ffcd]}{[0108|01cd]}You have come at the perfect\ntime! {[0104|000f]}I have something I want to\nshow you.{[0104|000f]}\n\n{[0106|02cd]}{[0108|01cd]}Come on up here!
DS_GORO_D_06	{[0109|2f080709]}{[0301]}{[0200]}! You made it into the\ndragon's territory?!{[0104|0054]}\n\n\n{[0109|2f010805]}{[0108|02cd]}I am so jealous!{[0104|005a]}\n\n\n\n{[0109|2f0f0706]}{[0108|02cd]}You outdid me again, bud!
DS_GORON_A_01	{[0109|00000002]}Good to see you, bud! Seems like you\npop up everywhere! Though I am one\nto talk...\n\n{[0109|00172008]}Anyway, bud, there is something I am\ndying to tell you. It is the discovery of\nthe century!\n\n{[0109|00002000]}This is a sacred place known as the\n{color[0003]}Temple of Time{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n{[0109|0000190a]}I could not believe my eyes when I saw a\n{color[0000]}human who lives on the legendary\nIsle of the Goddess{color[ffff]}!\n\n{[0109|00001900]}It wore clothes just like the ones\nwritten about in the ancient\nmanuscripts! And it looked just\nlike you, bud!\n{[0109|00082105]}It came with another person...and they\nentered the temple! I wanted to chase\nafter them...\n\n{[0109|00151b00]}But then there was an explosion all of a\nsudden! And the entrance... Well, you\ncan see for yourself, bud.\n\n{[0109|00162007]}I do not think we are getting past this\nmess. I just wish we could find out\nwhat is happening on the other side!
DS_GORON_A_02	{[0109|00151b09]}What? You made it inside?\n\n\n\n{[0109|00151b00]}You mean to say there is a secret\npassage I did not know about?\nWhy did you not tell me, bud?!\n\n{[0109|00082100]}I was just about to give up and go home\nwhen I heard this huge crash. I rushed\nback to find that the way had been\ncleared.\n{[0109|00162007]}I am going to explore inside. {[0109|00002000]}I have to\ngo back to the Sealed Grounds soon, \nso it looks like I am going to be busy!
DS_GORON_A_03	{[0109|00162007]}I wish I could see what is happening\non the other side! Maybe there is\nanother way into the temple?
DS_GORON_A_04	{[0109|00162007]}I am going to explore inside! {[0109|00002000]}I have to\nhead back to the Sealed Grounds soon,\nso it looks like I am going to be busy.

DS_06_02	{[0109|00030900]}Really, vrrm? You came on board to\nfind {color[0000]}Nayru's Flame{color[ffff]}, zrrt?\n\n\n{[0109|00030900]}If you want to reveal {color[0000]}Nayru's Flame{color[ffff]},\nyou're going to have to regain control\nof this ship, phoo-weep.\n\n{[0109|00030900]}The control room is next to the brig,\nbut its huge door is sealed shut and\nyou'll need a key to open it, vrrm.\n\n{[0109|00030900]}First you should head to the {color[0003]}captain's\ncabin{color[ffff]}, zrrt! {[010b|00000004]}The control-room key\nshould be in there, vweep!
DS_06_03	{[0109|00030900]}But I'm getting out of here, vrrm.\n\n\n\n{[0109|00030900]}Sorry to leave you on your own, but\nyou look like you can handle it, zrrt!\nWe're counting on you, vweep!

DS_06_05	{[0109|00030900]}There's a corridor from the engine\nroom that connects to this brig, vrrm.
DS_06_06	{[0109|00030900]}But to get through the engine room to\nhere, bzzt, you need to activate the two\n{color[0000]}{[010b|00000004]}power generators{color[ffff]} in the engine room.
DS_06_07	{[0109|00030900]}You can get to the captain's cabin\nthrough a door on the deck in the\nback, vrrm.

It looks like the engine\nroom is up and running, vrrm.\n\n\n{[0109|00030900]}Did you turn on the {color[0000]}power{color[ffff]}, vweep?\n{[0109|00030900]}OK, then I'm sure you can get through\nthe engine room to here now, zrrt!\n\n{[0109|00030900]}We'll be waiting, phoo-weep!
DS_06_10	{[0109|00030900]}The last {color[0000]}power generator{color[ffff]} is here, vrrm.

DS_07_01	{[0109|00030900]}{[0301]}{[0200]}! Good job, vweep!
DS_07_02	{[0109|00030900]}It's still pretty dangerous here, so I'll\njust wait in the boat, zrrt.\n\n\n{[0109|00030900]}You can do it, vrrm!
DS_07_03	{[0109|00030900]}Now the ship looks just like it used to,\nphoo-weep!

DS_09_01	A report, {[0112|0000000b]}Master. Judging by their size,\nthese {color[0000]}tentacles {color[ffff]}belong to a monster\nof considerable size.\n\nThe current situation is difficult to\ndetermine with complete accuracy,\nbut signs indicate that this ship is\nunder attack.\nIf we do nothing, there is an 80%\nchance the ship will capsize.\n\n\nI recommend forcing it back with\n{color[0000]}{[010b|00000004]}{color[ffff]}{color[0000]}sacred power{color[ffff]}, then exiting to further\nassess the current situation.
DS_10_01	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I can confirm that, as\nmentioned by the crew, the engine\nroom is now fully operational.\n\nBut the corridor to the brig will not be\npassable until you activate the other\n{color[0000]}power generator{color[ffff]}. I suggest hurrying\nto the second {color[0000]}power generator{color[ffff]}.
DS_10_02	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I can confirm that the engine\nroom is now fully operational.\n\n\nI suggest hurrying to the brig through\nthe engine room and {color[0004]}freeing{color[ffff]} the crew\nimmediately.
DS_10_03	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I am detecting very strong\nvibrations.\n\n\nSigns indicate that activating this\nmechanism has caused something\nwithin the ship to begin moving.\n\nThe current situation is difficult\nto accurately assess, but I suggest\nhurrying to the {color[0003]}crew in the brig{color[ffff]}\nand freeing them first.
DS_10_04	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I am detecting strong\nvibrations again.\n\n\nThe current situation is difficult\nto accurately assess, but I suggest\nhurrying to the area beneath the\n{color[0003]}crew in the brig {color[ffff]}first.
DS_11_01	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I conjecture that this is the\n{color[0000]}key {color[ffff]}to the {[010b|00000004]}control room mentioned by\nthe crew.
DS_11_02	My memory indicates that the location\nof the {color[0003]}door to the control room {color[ffff]}is\nmarked with the {[0204|19cd]} symbol.
DS_11_03	I suggest you quickly make your way to\nthe {color[0003]}control room{color[ffff]}.
DS_12_01	{[0112|00000001]}Master, please look.
DS_12_02	This large door here is sealed shut.
DS_12_03	This door must lead to an important\nroom in the ship.
DS_13_01	Warning, {[0112|00000001]}Master.
DS_13_02	I sense an evil presence on the other\nside of this door.
DS_13_03	There is a 90% chance it is the primary\nbody mass of the creature whose\ntentacles are destroying this ship.\n\nI suggest making all necessary\npreparations before exiting to\nthe outside of the ship.
DS_14_01	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I have important information\nfor you. There is a 90% chance the\nobject you see over there is a\n{[010b|00000004]}{color[0000]}Timeshift Stone{color[ffff]}.\nIf you could {color[0004]}deliver an impact {color[ffff]}to it by\nsome means, it could have a significant\neffect on the ship.
DS_15_01	{[0112|00000001]}Master, that synthetic life-form...\nThere is a 99% chance that it was the\n{color[0003]}pirate{color[ffff]} described by the captain.\n\nI can't help but admire the tenacity\nit has displayed in staying alive and\nfunctional all these years.
DS_15_02	However, it will be difficult to target it\nfrom here, so I recommend you return\nto the deck.
DS_15_03	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, a report about the bow you\nhave just obtained...\n\n\nYour bow's elasticity can propel arrows\nthrough the air with great force,\nallowing you to {color[0004]}strike your targets\nfrom afar{color[ffff]}.\nTo confirm the controls associated\nwith your bow, raise your bow by\npressing {[0204|29cd]} then press {[0204|13cd]}.{[0111|0fcd]}{[0111|0bcd]}
DS_15_03_2	You can also shoot arrows to strike\n{color[0000]}certain devices {color[ffff]}in order to activate\nthem.
DS_15_04	I have confirmed that such a {color[0000]}device\n{color[ffff]}exists on the {color[0003]}{[010b|00000004]}{color[ffff]}{color[0003]}deck{color[ffff]}.
DS_17_01	{[0112|00000001]}Master, look up.
DS_17_02	You can reach the Timeshift Stone\non the deck through the ventilation\nshaft in the ceiling.

DS_15_03	{[0109|00070000]}The {color[0005]}{[010b|00000004]}sea chart {color[ffff]}we need is in my shack,\nzrrt. But you're the one who will have\nto go get it, bzzt!\n\nThere are more monsters about than\nbefore, so be careful, vweep!\n\n\n{[0109|00070000]}I can't wander far from the boat,\nso I'll just stay here, vrrm.
DS_16_01	We've arrived, vrrm!\n\n\n\nThis is the island where we used to\nmake our ships, bzzt. You'll find the\nShipyard here, as well as the town\nwhere the workers lived, vweep!
DS_16_02	But the entrance is closed, vrrrm.\nLooks like you can't get in.
DS_16_03	{[0109|00070000]}Each location on the island is linked\nto the others via a mine-cart track,\nvrrm!
DS_16_04	There's a mine-cart station over there,\nzrrt!
DS_16_05	{[0109|00070000]}You should head to the station first.\nI'll wait here, phoo-weep!
DS_16_06	{[0109|00070000]}You might be able to get to the back\ndoor of the construction bay if you can\nget around to the other side of it using\na mine cart, brrzrrt.
DS_16_07	That building is the construction bay,\nvrrm!
DS_17_01	This is easily as scary as I thought it\nwould be, vrrm{[0104|0005]}.{[0104|0005]}.{[0104|0005]}.\n\n\n{[0109|00070000]}But if you think about it, they should\nall be dead, brrzrrt!\n\n\n{[0109|00070000]}The only reason I'm up and about like\nthis is because of that Timeshift Stone\non the boat, phoo-weep!\n\n{[0109|00070000]}So I have nothing to worry about, vrrm!\nI feel better now, {[0301]}{[0200]}.\nAnd so it's time for you to go look for\nmy ship, zrt!\n{[0109|00070000]}I'll wait here, of course, bzzt.
DS_18_01	You can now set your {color[0000]}dowsing{color[ffff]} ability\nto search for the ship that holds\n{color[0000]}{color[0000]}{[010b|00000004]}{color[0000]}Nayru's Flame{color[ffff]}.
DS_18_02	{[0112|0000000b]}I have information to report, Master.\nPlease take a look.
DS_18_03	There is a 60% probability that these\nmasts and these sails are from the ship\nthat protects {color[0000]}Nayru's Flame{color[ffff]}.
DS_19_01	{[0112|0000000b]}A report, Master. I calculate a 0%\nchance that searching further in this\nlocation will lead to the appearance\nof the ship.\nBecause of those substantially\nunfavorable odds, I suggest reporting\nto the ship's captain and leaving this\nisland.
DS_19_02	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, it would appear that in the\nmany years this factory went unused,\nmonsters have moved in and built\na nest.\nI now estimate that the chance of \nfinding a clue in the sand here as to the\nship's location is extremely low.
DS_21_01	{[0112|00000064]}Did you see it, phoo-weep?\nThat's my ship, vrrm!\n\n\nWe must pursue, bzzt! And keep\npounding it with the cannon, zrrt!
DS_22_01	Open up the {color[0005]}sea chart {color[ffff]}you brought\nwith you, zrrt!
DS_22_02	The {color[0003]}{[010b|00000004]}{color[ffff]}{color[0003]}Shipyard {color[ffff]}is at this location,\nvrrt. Let me mark it for you with an\n{[0204|19cd]}, vweep.
DS_22_03	{[0109|00070000]}OK! Set sail, vrrm!
DS_22_04	{[0109|00070000]}The Shipyard is where we used to build\nour ships, vrrt. My ship was built there\ntoo, vweep!\n\n{[0109|00070000]}If you go to the Shipyard, you might\nfind some clues to the location of my\nship, brrzrrt!
DS_23_01	This is pretty scary, vweep{[0104|0005]}.{[0104|0005]}.{[0104|0005]}.\n\n\n\nThe pirate captain is a mechanical\nmaniac, zrrt! He's got no shortage\nof evil underlings too, vrrm!\n\n{[0109|00070000]}I never wanted to lay eyes on him\nagain, brrzrrt. But{[0104|0005]}.{[0104|0005]}.{[0104|0005]}.\n\n\n{[0109|00070000]}If we want to take the ship back, then\nwe have no choice, phoo-weep!
DS_23_02	The {[010b|00000004]}{color[0003]}Pirate Stronghold {color[ffff]}is here at this\n{[0204|19cd]} mark, zrrt.
DS_23_03	{[0109|00070000]}Tighten up whatever you humans have\ninstead of bolts, and let's get going,\nphoo-weep!
DS_24_01	{[0109|00070000]}How are we going to search this whole\nhuge sea, vrrm?\n\n\n{[0109|00070000]}I have no choice but to ask you to do\nit for me, brrzrrt! So get cracking,\nvweep!\n\n{[0109|00070000]}There is a high probability that the ship\nis currently hidden from our view,\nphoo-weep. But {[010b|00000004]}{color[0004]}if we attack it{color[ffff]}, then we\nmight catch a glimpse of it, zrrt!
DS_40_01	{[0112|00000001]}Master, please take a look.
DS_40_02	This object is called a {color[0005]}{[010b|00000004]}Timeshift Orb{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n\nI conjecture that, unlike the Timeshift\nStones we've seen, this device was\ndesigned to be carried around and\ninstalled in different locations.
DS_41_01	{[0112|00000001]}Master, look over there.
DS_41_02	That is the ship containing Nayru's\nFlame. There is a 90% chance that the\nsynthetic life-forms assembled here\nare the crew.
DS_41_03	This image would indicate that the\nship's captain spent many happy days\namong his many crew members.
DS_42_01	{[0112|00000001]}Master, please take a look.
DS_42_02	This device looks like it is meant to\nhold a {color[0000]}Timeshift Stone{color[ffff]}, but there is\nnot one currently installed.\n\nThere is a 95% chance that it is the\nsame type of device as the ones we\nencountered in {color[0003]}Lanayru Mine{color[ffff]}.
DS_42_03	Signs indicate that {[010b|00000004]}{color[0000]}Timeshift Stones{color[ffff]}\nwere used in this facility as a kind of\npower source.
DS_43_01	{[0112|00000001]}Master, we have arrived at the\nShipyard construction bay.
DS_43_02	With the passing of many years, this\nstructure has filled with sand.
DS_43_03	I recommend looking in the sand for a\nclue that may direct you to the location\nof the ship.
DS_44_01	{[0112|00000001]}I recommend waiting until after you\nhave achieved your objective before\ntaking a rest. First we need to find the\nsea chart.
DS_45_01	A report, {[0112|0000000b]}Master.
DS_45_02	I have detected a bug infestation in\nthe upper area of the house.
DS_46_01	A report, {[0112|0000000b]}Master. The power of the\nTimeshift Orb appears to have caused\na change in this structure.\n\nI recommend going outside to further\nassess the situation.
DS_50_01	To Shipyard Center
DS_50_02	To the Pier
DS_51_01	To the Construction Bay
DS_52_01	Approach the cart \nand press {[0204|00cd]} to get on.
DS_53_01	Lean your body to balance the\nweight of the cart as you\napproach a curve.
DS_54_01	If you're moving too fast,\npress {[0204|01cd]} to slow down.
DS_55_01	Jump up to clear obstacles.
DS_56_01	Last Stop: Construction Bay
DS_57_01	Only YOU can warn your\ncoworkers early enough to\navoid pirate attacks, zrrt!
DS_58_01	At the end of this month, rail\ncars will be out of operation\nfor a full day while the track\nis inspected, vrrm.
DS_59_01	I hope the plans for my ship\nare completed soon...
DS_60_01	{[0105|000f0000]}A report, {[0112|0000000b]}Master.\n\n\n\n{[0105|003c0000]}This is {color[0003]}Lanayru Sand Sea{color[ffff]}. This whole\narea was once a vast ocean.
DS_60_02	{[0105|005a0000]}But the water has all evaporated, and\nnow the area is a sea of sand.
DS_60_03	{[0105|005a0000]}Signs indicate that this place \nfunctioned as a port, linking the land\nto the sea.
DS_60_04	{[0105|003c0000]}This area operated on a new form \nof power. There is a 90% probability\nthat the{color[0000]} sacred flame{color[ffff]} is located ahead.\n\n{[0105|001e0000]}I recommend exploring this sand sea.
DS_70_01	Dear Captain,\nThanks for everything, zrrt!\nYours, the Crew, vrrrrrm.
DS_71_01	Dear Dad,\nGood luck at work, vrrm!

TELOP_D300_01	Lanayru Mining\nFacility
DS_D1_01	{[0112|00000001]}Master, look at this.
DS_D1_02	There is a great door here that is\nlocked tight.
DS_D1_03	It is only logical that something of\ngreat importance likely rests behind\nthis door.

Cough...
DF3_10	{[0109|00080a00]}Hold on, now. Didn't you just say you\ncame from the sky, {[0200]}?\nSo then you're the hero chosen by the\ngoddess, aren't you?\nI see... Well, that is something...\n\n\n\n{[0109|000a0a00]}Although I must apologize. You see,\nI can't really help you.\n\n\n{[0109|000a0a00]}I may have enough strength for a brief\nchat like this, but... Well, as you can\nsee, I am quite ill.{[0104|001e]} {[0109|0000000c]}Cough...\n\n{[0109|000a0a00]}I'm in no shape to sing.\n\n\n\n{[0109|00110804]}And to think it was the goddess herself\nwho entrusted me with this important\nduty...

DF3_02	{[0109|00080a03]}Hello there, {[0200]}.{[0104|000f]}\nIt looks like you've found a {color[0000]}seedling\nfrom the Tree of Life{color[ffff]}, haven't you?\n\nBut it's too late. I'm done for.{[0104|001e]}\nI won't live long enough for the tree to\ngrow large and produce the fruit that\ncould save me.{[0109|0008110c]} Cough...cough...\nIt's such a shame.

DF3_03	{[0104|0014]}.{[0104|0014]}.{[0104|0014]}.
DF3_05	The robots were worried about me, so\nthey planted a {color[0000]}seedling from the Tree\nof Life{color[ffff]}. The fruit of this tree is said to\nbe able to cure any illness...\nThey planted the seedling over there.{[0104|0014]}\nCough...{[0109|0008110c]}{[0104|001e]} {[0109|00000000]}But it just won't grow.{[0104|001e]}\nCough...{[0109|0008110c]}{[0104|002d]} {[0109|00110804]}I think this is the end for me.{[0104|0014]}
DF3_06	What's that, {[0200]}?\nYou say you will find a place where\nthe seedling {color[0000]}will {color[ffff]}{color[0000]}grow quickly {color[ffff]}for me?\n\n{[0109|00110804]}That would be a great help... All I\nwould need to do is eat one piece of\n{color[0000]}fruit from the Tree of Life{color[ffff]} to recover\nmy full strength.\n{[0109|00080a00]}But that seedling cannot be planted\njust anywhere. Look for a place with\n{color[0000]}very rich soil{color[ffff]}.
DF3_07	{[0109|000b0901]}{[0301]}{[0200]}! I owe you my life!\nYou have to let me repay you.\n\n\n{[0109|00000900]}Give me some time to prepare, and\nwhen you next return to visit me...\nI believe you will be mightily pleased!

DF3_ROBO_A_02	{[0109|00030c00]}{color[0003]}Master Thunder Dragon{color[ffff]}'s condition has\nbeen bad for a long time,{[0104|000f]} and the soil\nhere is not suitable for growing trees,\nzrrt.{[0104|001e]} {[0109|00010c00]}If only we had more time, vrrm...
DF3_ROBO_A_03	{[0109|00030900]}What are you doing with that seedling,\nvrrm?!{[0104|001e]} {color[0003]}Master Thunder Dragon{color[ffff]} needs\n{color[0000]}fruit from the Tree of Life{color[ffff]} to recover!\n\n{[0109|00030900]}Unless you mean to help our master,\nbzzzzt?\n{[0100|ffff]}Of course.{[0101|ffff]}Not really.
DF3_ROBO_A_07	{[0109|00030900]}Really, vrrm?! Thank you, zrrt!\nMake sure you plant the seedling\nsomewhere it will be sure to thrive,\nphoo-weep.\n{[0109|00030900]}I fear growing the seedling to maturity\nin {color[0000]}Lanayru Province is impossible{color[ffff]},{[010b|00000004]}\nbrrzrrt. We're counting on you, vweep!
DF3_ROBO_A_08	{[0109|00030900]}Well, since you uprooted it, it's your\nresponsibility now, vrrm! Make sure\nyou plant that seedling where it can\ngrow to maturity, phoo-weep.\n{[0109|00030900]}And that means taking it somewhere\n{color[0000]}outside of the Lanayru area{color[ffff]}, bzzt!{[010b|00000004]}\nWe're all counting on you, vweep!
DF3_ROBO_A_04	{[0109|00030c00]}I don't think there's any way that\nseedling would ever mature if you\nplanted it in the {color[0003]}Lanayru area{color[ffff]}, vrrm...\n\n{[0109|00000900]}We need your help, brrzrrt! {[0109|00030900]}Master\nThunder Dragon needs the {color[0000]}fruit from\nthe Tree of Life {color[ffff]}to regain his strength!

DF3_ROBO_B_02	{[0109|00030c00]}Situation critical, vrrrrm! {color[0003]}Master\nThunder Dragon {color[ffff]}is very sick, bzzt.{[0104|000f]}\n\n\n{[0109|00030c00]}And we can't do anything with this\nTimeshift Stone without Master\nThunder Dragon's permission, vrrm.{[0104|001e]}\n\n{[0109|00010c00]}But I guess we have bigger things to\nworry about than a Timeshift Stone,\nbrrzrrt...
DF3_ROBO_B_03	{[0109|00030900]}We wanted Master Thunder Dragon to\nget well, so we planted a {color[0000]}seedling from\nthe Tree of Life{color[ffff]}, which bears a fruit\nthat is said to cure any illness, vrrm.
DF3_ROBO_B_04	{[0109|00030c00]}This area is only good for growing\ngrass and flowers, zrrt.{[0104|001e]} {[0109|00010c00]}If we can't find\na way to grow the seedling quickly...\n{[0106|fecd]}Our master will not make it, bzzt...

DF4_GORON_13_2	{[0109|2f080d0a]}You are not the only one! I found \nout some more about the legend of the\nthree dragons. This news is going to\nblow your mind!\n...I have found out that there is indeed\na hidden area beyond here!

DF4_GORON_15	{[0109|2f080d0a]}I was able to dig a tunnel to the place\nwhere the {color[0000]}Thunder Dragon{color[ffff]} lives, but...{[0104|002d]}\n{[0106|ffcd]}{[0109|2f0d0800]}It is too narrow for me to go through.\n{[0106|ffcd]}{[0109|2f080700]}What am I going to do?

TROLLEY_01_01	This station here was used by\nfolks heading into the old mines.\nPeople still ride the mine carts\nall over the place, though!\nI am probably supposed to tell you\nthere is some “safety information"\nabout using the carts posted on\nthe wall over there.\nCart riding can be, uh...dangerous at\ntimes, so I would suggest you give that\nstuff a quick read.
TROLLEY_01_02	It is pretty fun to ride these mine carts.\nOne day, I would love to set up a race!
TROLLEY_01_03	Up for another run on the Rickety\nCoaster? You never know what will\nhappen. Just 20 Rupees!\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure!{[0101|0000]}Uh...no.
TROLLEY_01_04	Hey, {[0200]}! You are back!\n\n\n\nThink you have got the stomach to ride\nthe Rickety Coaster? Just 20 Rupees!\n{[0100|ffff]}I'm in!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
TROLLEY_01_05	Oh well. Maybe some other time, eh?
TROLLEY_01_06	You are out of cash? Well, then I guess\nthat is that. Come back once you get\nyourself some pocket change.
TROLLEY_01_07	Want to hear the rules again?\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure.{[0101|0000]}Nope.
TROLLEY_01_08	This here is a race against time—\nscream across that finish line as fast\nas you can!\n\nTilt your body to lean your cart. If you\nlean at just the right angle on a corner,\nyou will get a nice speed boost.\n\nLose your concentration when you are\ncruising around a bend, though, and\nyou will run right off the rails. If that\nhappens, you lose the race.
TROLLEY_01_09	Your best time so far is:\n{[0203|0000000000cd]}:{[0203|0000000102cd]}.{[0203|0000000202cd]}.
TROLLEY_01_10	All right, let us get going!
TROLLEY_01_11	So I have your attention?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes.{[0101|0000]}No.
TROLLEY_01_12	Hey, you! What are you doing?\n\n\n\nWell, you are here now...so how about a\nlittle fun?\n{[0100|ffff]}Fun?{[0101|0000]}No way.
TROLLEY_01_13	Now, come on, do not be like that.\nHear me out first!\n{[0100|ffff]}OK.{[0101|0000]}No chance.
TROLLEY_01_14	Got your attention, eh? Geheh.\nLet me explain...
TROLLEY_01_15	You could at least let me explain\nthe rules...
TROLLEY_01_16	Oh, all right, see you some other time!
TROLLEY_01_17	What about all these prizes I have?\nSo you are OK with letting them go to\nwaste? You really are not interested?\n{[0100|ffff]}Let's do it.{[0101|0000]}I'm sure.
TROLLEY_01_18	Well, come back anytime you want to\ngive it a try!
TROLLEY_01_19	You finished!
TROLLEY_01_20	You set a new record!\nGreat work!
TROLLEY_01_21	Hope you come by again soon!
TROLLEY_01_22	Hold it. You cannot be serious. \nThat was way too slow! Look, there is \njust no way I can give you a prize for\nthat time.
TROLLEY_01_23	I know you can do better than that.\nYou were just warming up, right?\n\n\nThe secret is in getting just the right\ntilt. Here—you have earned this prize\nat least.
TROLLEY_01_24	Not a bad time. Nope, not bad at all!\nHere is your prize!
TROLLEY_01_25	Whoa, now! That was...unbelievable!\nEven I cannot go that fast.
TROLLEY_01_26	What do you say? Have you got the guts\nto ride the Rickety Coaster? Just 20\nRupees a ride.\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
TROLLEY_01_27	So what track will it be?\n{[0100|ffff]}Scary!{[0101|ffff]}Heart stopping!
TROLLEY_01_28	Got it—the scary track it is. Good luck!
TROLLEY_01_29	So you want the heart-stopping track,\neh? You got it, but I just hope you are\nready...
TROLLEY_01_30	Your best time so far is:\n{[0203|0000000300cd]}:{[0203|0000000402cd]}.{[0203|0000000502cd]}.
TROLLEY_01_31	Time is up. Try again next time!
TROLLEY_01_32	Here you go! I found this treasure\nright here on this very island.
TROLLEY_01_33	This is something I have been saving\njust for you.
TROLLEY_01_34	You get a Rupee I have taken really\ngood care of! I have been holding on to\nthis one forever, but it is yours now.
TROLLEY_01_35	Not a bad time, but you are nowhere\nnear as fast as I am. Here are\n50 Rupees!
TROLLEY_02_01	Hey, that is my seat! Nobody sits their\nrear end on my seat but me, got it?
TROLLEY_02_02	I have been here alone for...well, who\nknows how long. Years.\n\n\nBut I get to ride these carts every\nday, and I never get bored of it!
TROLLEY_03_01	I am here every day running this\ncoaster, but you are the only one who\never shows up. Could you spread the\nword? It is lonely out here. And...dry.

DS_SIREN_01	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}.
DS_SIREN_09	As you know by now, I cannot follow\nyou. The trial calls out to your mind{[0112|00000002]}\nalone, as it is in every {color[0003]}Silent Realm{color[ffff]}.\n\nThis is the second trial, known as\n{color[0003]}Nayru's Silent Realm{color[ffff]}. It will test\nyour {color[0000]}wisdom{color[ffff]}, {[0112|00000002]}Master.\n\nYou must overcome this trial to find\nthe flames that will enhance your\nsword.
DS_SIREN_04	When your vessel is full, your spirit\nwill grow and you will be entrusted\nwith a {color[0000]}new power {color[ffff]}by the goddess.\n\nDo you have any questions?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes!{[0101|0000]}No.
DS_SIREN_25	Which topic do you wish to review?\n\n\n{[0100|ffff]}The {[0201|0011]}?{[0101|ffff]}Guardians?{[0102|ffff]}Waking Water?{[0103|0000]}Never mind.
DS_SIREN_26	Do you have any further questions?\n\n{[0100|ffff]}The {[0201|0011]}?{[0101|ffff]}Guardians?{[0102|ffff]}Waking Water?{[0103|0000]}Never mind.
DS_SIREN_28	Yes, {[0112|00000005]}Master.
DS_SIREN_03	{[0112|00000002]}Master, I will await your return in the\noutside world.
DS_SIREN_05	Yes, {[0112|00000005]}Master.\n\n\n\nTo fill the {color[0005]}{[0201|0011]}{color[ffff]}, you need to\nlocate and collect every {color[0005]}{[0201|002d]}\n{color[ffff]}scattered across this Silent Realm.
DS_SIREN_15	{[0112|00000002]}Master, do you see the glowing\nobject just in front of you?
DS_SIREN_16	That is a {color[0005]}{[0201|002d]}{color[ffff]}.\nYou will need to collect {color[0000]}15 {color[ffff]}of them.
DS_SIREN_07	{[0112|00000005]}Understood, Master.\nAllow me to explain.
DS_SIREN_18	If you take even a single step outside\nthe protective circle you stand in, the\n{color[0000]}Guardians {color[ffff]}of this realm will wake up\nand pursue you, {[0112|00000002]}Master.
DS_SIREN_19	If a {color[0000]}Guardian {color[ffff]}manages to land even\none attack on you, your spirit will\nshatter and you will fail the trial.
DS_SIREN_27	The unusual liquid substance that\ncovers that area is known as Waking\nWater, and it has certain unique\nproperties.\nIf you make contact with Waking\nWater, the {color[0000]}Guardians will be\nimmediately alerted to your presence{color[ffff]}.\n\nPools of Waking Water are located all\nthroughout the area. I suggest you\nwatch where you step...
DS_SIREN_20_1	You must collect the {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]} scattered\nthroughout this area and fill the\n{color[0005]}{[0201|0011]} {color[ffff]}without\nbeing hit by an attack.
DS_SIREN_10	When your {color[0005]}{[0201|0011]}{color[ffff]} is filled with\n15 {color[0000]}tears{color[ffff]}, your spirit will grow and you\nwill be blessed by the goddess with a\nnew power.\n{[0112|00000002]}Master, I will await your return in the\noutside world.
DS_SIREN_20	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, I can\nunfortunately confirm that you\nhave failed to pass the trial.
DS_SIREN_22	Collect all the {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]} within the Silent\nRealm. I shall await your return here.
DS_SIREN_11	{[0112|00000002]}Master, so long as you have the will and\ndetermination, you can retry a trial\nas many times as you like.\n \nA good strategy is {color[0000]}to find, but then\ndeliberately not pick up{color[ffff]}, the most-\neasily-accessible {color[0005]}{color[0005]}tears{color[0005]} {color[ffff]}until you are\ndiscovered and really need one.\nCollect the 15 {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]} and complete the\ntrial. I will await your return in the\noutside world.
DS_SIREN_12	The locations of {color[0005]}tears{color[ffff]} you have\ngathered during your trial are\n{color[0000]}marked on the map{color[ffff]}.\n\nYou will have an easier time\ncompleting your task if you\nfirst set out to discover the\nlocations of all 15 tears.
DS_SIREN_21	{color[0000]}Two types of Watchers {color[ffff]}patrol the\nrealm, looking for intruders. I highly\nsuggest you take caution.\n\nSo long as you do not step into their\nlight, you will remain undetected\nby {color[0000]}flying Sky Watchers{color[ffff]}.\n\nHowever, the {color[0000]}Earth Watchers{color[ffff]}, who\n{color[0000]}hover near the ground{color[ffff]}, will give chase\nif you come too close to them, so {color[0000]}stay\nalert {color[ffff]}and maintain a safe distance.
DS_SIREN_13	{[0112|00000001]}Master, the chances of your not being\nthe chosen one are increasing...\n\n\nRepeated attempts at this trial have\nscattered your concentration and made\nyour performance erratic. I suggest\nyou rest awhile before trying again.
DS_SIREN_14	I suggest using smart tactics to your\nadvantage. Try {color[0000]}leaving easy-to-collect\ntears {color[ffff]}for when you are being pursued.
DS_SIREN_23	The locations of {color[0005]}tears {color[ffff]}that you have\npreviously collected will be {color[0000]}marked\non the map{color[ffff]}, so make good use of that.\n\nConfirm the locations of all 15 tears\nfirst to increase your chances of\nsuccessfully completing the trial.
DS_SIREN_24	{[0112|00000001]}Master, in addition to the {color[0000]}Guardians{color[ffff]}\nwho will attack you, there are also two\ntypes of {color[0000]}Watchers {color[ffff]}that search for\nintruders {color[0000]}on the ground and in the sky{color[ffff]}.\nThe two types of Watchers exhibit\ndramatically different behavior, so be\nsure you understand how to avoid\ndetection by both.

SAL451_06	I have identified the item that the\nunusual man on Fun Fun Island says\nwas lost.\n\nUnder usual circumstances, we could\ncall the Scrap Shop robot to come and\nretrieve it.\n\nHowever, the robot is currently\ncarrying out some duties at Eldin\nVolcano, so we cannot call him here.\n\nI recommend returning to Eldin\nVolcano and verifying the status\nof the robot.

BATTLE_02	{[0109|00070c09]}Right...{[0104|000f]} No need to knock yourself out\nfighting these enemies here. Might as\nwell save yourself for the real battles,\nI suppose...\n{[0109|00000c00]}So don't even sweat it. Just come on\nback when you're back to full strength.\nI'll be waiting!
BATTLE_03	{[0109|00070c06]}Spoken like a little warrior. I like it!

BATTLE_05_11	{color[0003]}{[0109|000b0c0d]}Ghirahim{color[ffff]} it is! He's the creepy guy you\nfought at the {color[0003]}Sealed Grounds{color[ffff]}.
BATTLE_05_12	{[0109|000b0c0d]}OK, {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]} it is! You've fought some\nreal baddies, but this one really makes\nmy scales crawl!
BATTLE_06	{[0109|000d0c00]}Ah!{[0104|000f]} I forgot to tell you something!\n\n\n\nThe only items you can use in battle are\n{color[0000]}items you would have had at the time{color[ffff]}.\nYep, that's it!\n\n{[0109|00070c00]}Also, {color[0000]}pouch items are prohibited{color[ffff]}!\nI know that sounds really hard, but you\nfought these guys once before, so I've\ngot to keep it interesting.\n{[0109|00000c00]}Hmm... Maybe I am being a little bit\nrough on you here. Tell you what...\nI'll let you take the {color[0000]}shield you currently\nhave equipped{color[ffff]}.
BATTLE_07	{[0109|00000c00]}You all set? You've got a shield on\nand everything? If you're ready,\nwe're going to do this for real!\nAre we ready?\n{[0100|ffff]}Let's do this!{[0101|0000]}Maybe not.
BATTLE_08	{[0109|00070c0d]}Psych yourself up for this!
BATTLE_09	{[0109|00000c05]}Oh, so you've changed your mind?{[0104|0014]}\nNo scales off my back. If you want to\ntry later, you're welcome to come back\nat any time.\n{[0109|00070c00]}If you want to change your shield, just\nequip the one you need and come talk\nto me again.
BATTLE_10	{[0109|00000c00]}All right, then...which period of your\njourney would you like to face an\nenemy from?\n{[0100|ffff]}The beginning.{[0101|ffff]}The middle.{[0102|ffff]}Later on.{[0103|0000]}Never mind.
BATTLE_10_01	{[0109|00070c00]}Now then...would you like to face an\nenemy from near the beginning of\nyour journey, or a fairly recent one?\n{[0100|ffff]}The beginning.{[0101|ffff]}Fairly recent.{[0102|0000]}Never mind.
BATTLE_11	{[0109|000b0c07]}Wow, {[0200]}! That was\nincredible. You're quite a warrior!
BATTLE_12	{[0109|000b0c07]}Well done! Spectacular skills on display\nonce again.
BATTLE_13	Here's how long it took you to finish\noff {color[0003]}{[0202|00000000]}{color[ffff]}:\n{[0203|0000000000cd]}:{[0203|0000000102cd]}.{[0203|0000000202cd]}.
BATTLE_14	{[0109|00000008]}Hey, you know what? That was your\nfirst time reliving that battle! Let's\ncelebrate with a little prize for your\nefforts.{[0109|000c0b06]}
BATTLE_15	{[0109|00000006]}Nice work! You beat your record!\nI can't let you go empty handed.\nHere—take this.{[0109|000c0b06]}
BATTLE_16	That was not your finest, I have to say!\nNo new record. Seriously, maybe you\ncould step it up a little bit next time.
BATTLE_16_07	That was not your finest, I have to say!\nNo new record! Still...you beat\neverything I can throw at you right\nnow, so that's something!
BATTLE_16_01	By the way, if you want my greatest\nprize, you'll have to beat the record:\n{color[0000]}{[0203|0000000300cd]}:{[0203|0000000402cd]}{color[ffff]}.\n\nIf you want to best that, you're going to\nhave to start training like a champ!
BATTLE_16_02	{[0109|000b0c09]}Congratulations! That's eight victories\nin a row!
BATTLE_16_03	{[0109|000b0c09]}Wow! You pulled off nine victories in a\nrow! Who would have thought?
BATTLE_16_04	{[0109|000b0c09]}You pulled off 10 victories in a row?!\nYou're something else!
BATTLE_16_05	{[0109|000b0c09]}You keep amazing me, you know that?\nEleven victories in a row... I've never\nseen anything like it!
BATTLE_16_06	{[0109|000b0c09]}Twelve battles, twelve victories!\nYou are the real deal... A genuine\nwarrior!
BATTLE_16_08	{[0109|000b0c09]}What's this? Your pouch is full, and so\nis your space at the Item Check in\nSkyloft? Then I guess you won't be\ngetting this shield.
BATTLE_16_09	Ouch! Can't be helped, I guess. Oh, but\nI will give you 1000 Rupees for that\nimpressive performance!{[0109|000c0b06]} You'll just\nhave to try for the shield next time.
BATTLE_17	{[0109|00100c00]}By the way, {[0200]}...what \ndo you think about trying another\nbattle right now?\n\n{[0109|000b0c09]}I wouldn't ask you if there wasn't\nanother reward on the table. In fact,\nthe more battles you win, the better\nyour reward when you finish! \nAs I mentioned before, I've got lots of\nrewards, including an {color[0000]}absurdly\nsturdy shield{color[ffff]}! Makes you want to leap\nright into another fight, doesn't it?\n{[0109|000d0c00]}However—{[0104|0014]}I bet you can see where I'm\ngoing with this—if you fail, that's the\nend of our little game.\n\nAnd keep in mind that {color[0000]}your shield\ndurability and hearts {color[ffff]}will carry over\nfrom battle to battle. It makes the\nbattles all the more...exciting!
BATTLE_18	Quit now, and you'll get yourself a not-\ntoo-shabby {color[0000]}{[0202|00000001]}{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nBut the next win will net you a\nfabulous {color[0000]}{[0202|00000002]}{color[ffff]}!\n{[0109|0000000a]}What'll it be? Do you want to\ncontinue?\n{[0100|ffff]}Continue!{[0101|0000]}Quit...
BATTLE_19	{[0109|00000008]}That's what I'm talking about!\nBut there's one more thing...\n\n\n{[0109|00070900]}For consecutive battles, I get to choose\nwhat opponent comes next. I mean...\nyou didn't really want to have to pick\nan enemy every time, did you?\nNow you get to look forward to finding\nout who your opponent is at the start of\neach battle. But enough chatter. Let's\nget this fight started!
BATTLE_20	{[0109|00000008]}Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!\n\n\n\nThe next battle will be No. {[0203|0000000300cd]}.\nTo defeat all the enemies, you must\nwin this many more battles: {[0203|0000000400cd]}.\nSo let's get on with it!
BATTLE_21	{[0109|00000005]}Right...{[0104|000f]} No need to knock yourself out\nfighting these enemies here, right?\nMight as well save yourself for the real\nbattles, I suppose...\n{[0109|000c0b06]}But you battled hard! Just as I\npromised, I'll give you this.
BATTLE_22_00	Here you go. Five Rupees. Hey, don't\ngive me that look!
BATTLE_22_01	Here's 20 Rupees. Don't go spending\nit all at once!
BATTLE_22_13	Here's 50 Rupees! Go on, then. Take it!
BATTLE_22_02	Here's 100 Rupees! Spend it on\nsomething worthwhile!
BATTLE_22_03	Here's 200 Rupees! Well, look at you\nnow!
BATTLE_22_04	Here's 300 Rupees! Go buy something\nnice for yourself!
BATTLE_22_05	Here's 500 Rupees! Must be a fortune\nfor you!
BATTLE_22_06	Look at this—1,000 Rupees!\nHave you ever seen so much?
BATTLE_22_07	Gah, 2,000 Rupees! It's robbery!
BATTLE_22_08	{[0109|000c0b06]}Hey! Take this!
BATTLE_22_09	{[0109|000c0b00]}Here's your prize!
BATTLE_22_10	{[0109|000c0b00]}You've won this fabulous prize!
BATTLE_22_11	Whoa, now! You get 3,000 Rupees!\nWhat are you going to spend it all on?!
BATTLE_22_12	This time you win 9,900 Rupees!\nI think you've pretty much cleaned\nme out!
BATTLE_22_14	{[0109|00010c09]}Come back for a battle anytime!\nYou know where to find me.
SIREN_00	{[0109|00000006]}You want to take a shot at a trial in the\n{color[0000]}Silent Realm{color[ffff]}? You got guts, boy!\n\n\n{[0109|00070c00]}These {color[0000]}Silent Realm{color[ffff]} challenges are the\nsame as all the trials you've seen up\nuntil now, and I'll be re-creating them\nright here.\nBut just finishing the trial won't be\nenough. I'll time how long it takes for\nyou to finish, and if you're fast enough,\nI'll give you a reward.\nHowever...{[0104|0014]}if you get hit even once by a\nGuardian, you'll fail the Silent Realm\nchallenge and return here {color[0000]}with \nseverely diminished hearts{color[ffff]}.\n{[0109|00070c0a]}So...are you up to the challenge?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes!{[0101|0000]}Not really.
SIREN_01	{[0109|00000005]}Hey, hold on a second... You look like\nyou're about to keel over! Are you sure\nyou're really ready for this?\n\nThis isn't worth risking your life for.\nHow about you give it a rest for today?\n\n\nCome back when you've replenished\nthose hearts.
SIREN_02	{[0109|00000006]}That's what I wanted to hear, brave\nwarrior! Now choose a Silent Realm\ntrial.\n{[0100|ffff]}Faron Woods!{[0101|ffff]}Eldin Volcano!{[0102|ffff]}Lanayru Desert!{[0103|0000]}Never mind.
SIREN_03_01	{[0109|00000006]}That's what I wanted to hear, brave\nwarrior! Now choose a Silent Realm\ntrial.\n{[0100|ffff]}Faron Woods!{[0101|ffff]}Eldin Volcano!{[0102|ffff]}Lanayru Desert!{[0103|ffff]}Somewhere else.
SIREN_03_02	{[0109|00000005]}Somewhere else? Where to, then?\n{[0100|ffff]}Skyloft!{[0101|ffff]}Previous places.{[0102|0000]}I quit.
SIREN_03_03	{[0109|0000000a]}Make your mind up already!\nWhich place will it be?\n{[0100|ffff]}Faron Woods.{[0101|ffff]}Eldin Volcano.{[0102|ffff]}Lanayru Desert.{[0103|ffff]}More places.
SIREN_13	Right, let me see... Your best time for\nthis area is: {[0203|0000000000cd]}:{[0203|0000000102cd]}.{[0203|0000000202cd]}.
SIREN_04	{[0109|000b0c0d]}Then let's get this thing started!\nClose your eyes and concentrate...
SIREN_05	{[0109|00000007]}Well done, {[0200]}! You got\nevery last one of them. You're a\ntrue warrior!
SIREN_06	{[0109|00000007]}Way to go! Looks like you made it back\nin one piece.
SIREN_17	{[0109|0000000b]}Ohhhhh, you really fumbled that one,\nmy friend...\n\n\nAnd failure comes with a price—you're\nleft with a single heart. Better go grab\nsome more and come back later.
SIREN_07	The time it took to finish this trial was\n{[0203|0000000000cd]}:{[0203|0000000102cd]}.{[0203|0000000202cd]}.
SIREN_08	{[0109|00000c05]}Looks like that was your first time in\na {color[0000]}Silent Realm {color[ffff]}trial here! We have to\ncelebrate that with a reward.{[0109|000c0b06]}
SIREN_09	{[0109|000b0c09]}Well done. That's a new record!\nI have just the right prize for you.\n{[0109|000c0b00]}Go on. Take it.
SIREN_10	{[0109|00000007]}Amazing, {[0200]}!\nThat's a very fast time!\nYou deserve something special.\nHere you go!{[0109|000c0b06]}
SIREN_14	{[0109|00000007]}Very impressive time! Here—this is\nyour prize!{[0109|000c0b06]}
SIREN_15	{[0109|0000000b]}Hmm... Nothing to get excited about...{[0104|0014]}\nBut you did your best, so have this.{[0109|000c0b06]}
SIREN_16	{[0109|0000000b]}Come on, now.{[0104|0014]} Are you even trying?\n\n\n\nNext time, put some heart into it! You\nknow, some oomph! I'm sorry to say\nthis is all I can give you this time.{[0109|000c0b06]}
SIREN_11	{[0109|0000000a]}So what do you say, {[0200]}?\nOne more {color[0000]}Silent Realm{color[ffff]} trial?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes!{[0101|0000]}No.
SIREN_12	{[0109|00000005]}Boring!{[0104|0014]} Well, if you change your mind,\ncome back and see me.
DF3_02	{[0109|000b0c08]}Whoa, {[0200]}, I told you to\nwait a little while, but you just couldn't\nresist, eh?\n\n{[0109|00000000]}Well I guess there's no sense in waiting\nany longer. Let's get this show started!\n\n\n{[0109|00000c00]}Of course, seeing as how you're the\nhero of legend, you don't really have\ntime to just goof off here, right?\n\n{[0109|000d0c00]}Right. So how about we make this bit\nof fun more meaningful by taking you\nback through some of those challenges\nyou've faced previously?\n{[0109|00070c00]}You know, sometimes you've got to step\nbackward to go forward. There's a\nlot you can learn from revisiting\nyour past struggles! Oh ho, yes!\n{[0109|00000c0a]}So, {[0200]}, are you game?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yeah!{[0101|0000]}Not really...

Demo64_05:02	Oh! OH! Is that what I think it is?\nYou brought that here for me,\ndidn't you?
Demo64_05:03	Whoa-ho... Down the hatch!{[0105|002d0000]}

Demo64_05:04	Oh, you've done it, boy. I can feel the\nfruit's effect surging through me!\nIt's exhilarating! I feel like a proper\ndragon again!

CF_01_01	{[0109|00424300]}Hah! She packs a mean punch, doesn't\nshe! I tell you, I was in love the first\ntime I pulled this lever!\n\n{[0109|003e4000]}I'll start loading her back up with\nanother bomb, so keep beating on big\nugly till I give you the signal!
CF_01_02	{[0109|00434500]}Whoops, missed! All this muscle's not\nworth much if I don't hit my target!\n\n\n{[0109|00414000]}I'll start loading my machine back up\nwith another bomb, so keep clobbering\nstanky toes till I give you the signal!
CF_01_03	{[0109|00444300]}We got it, but that shot hit kinda late!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00004000]}I'll start loading 'er back up, so keep\nbeating on big ugly till I give you the\nsignal!\n
CF_02	{[0109|0020403c]}Nice! You're locked and loaded!\nWe'll aim it to send you straight for\nthe spike on its head!
CF_03	This time, you're the payload! Haha!\nI'll give you a boost, but there's no\nguaranteeing this is gonna work.
CF_05	{[0109|0000000f]}I knew it. The seal has given way.\n\n\n\nI'll explain later, but now is the time\nfor action. We must keep that beast\nfrom escaping that pit!\n\nIt must not reach the temple!
CF_06_01	{[0112|00000001]}Master, I have information to report.
CF_06_02	While these doors appear to have been\nopened recently, they are now sealed\nshut by a powerful unidentified force.
CF_08	The creature we passed who was under\nassault may have information.\nI suggest we fight off his assailants.
CF_10	{[0105|00320000]}{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, we've\narrived.
CF_10_02	{[0105|004b0000]}This is the fabled {color[0003]}surface{color[ffff]} that has\nlong been part of Skyloft legend.
CF_10_03	{[0105|004b0000]}By my calculations, you are currently\npositioned in a location known as\nthe {color[0003]}Sealed Grounds{color[ffff]}.
CF_10_04	{[0105|004b0000]}Please proceed with caution, {[0112|0000000b]}Master.
CF_12	{[0112|00000001]}Master, please make sure to use your\nSailcloth when descending from high\nelevations. Failing to do so has a high\nprobability of resulting in injury.\nI took the liberty of deploying the\nSailcloth for you this time, but in the\nfuture you can manually engage it by\npressing {[0204|29cd]} before landing.{[0111|0fcd]}
CF_13_01	...{[0106|fdcd]}Young one...\n\n\n\n{[0106|fdcd]}Child of destiny descended from\nthe sky...
CF_13_02	{[0106|fdcd]}Raise the sword of the goddess\nskyward... {[0104|000f]}{[0106|fdcd]}Take aim at the evil aura\nand unleash its power...
CF_14	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I have information for you.\n\n\n\nI have the ability to offer information\non items and creatures you {color[0004]}target\n{color[ffff]}with {[0204|07cd]}.{[0111|07cd]}\n\n{color[0000]}While targeting{color[ffff]} something with {[0204|07cd]},\npress {[0204|11cd]} and I will brief you with all\nthe information I know on the subject.{[0111|07cd]}{[0111|09cd]}
CF_22	So lemme see if I've got this right.\n\n\n\nThe old lady living in the {color[0000]}temple {color[ffff]}down\nthe road from here knows where\n{color[0003]}Zelda {color[ffff]}is?
CF_23	I see... Right, {[0200]}.\nThanks for getting me here. You've \ndone a good job. You can head home.\n\n{[0109|000d0b41]}Big {color[0003]}Groose {color[ffff]}will handle the search for\n{color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} from here.
CF_23_01	Yup. I'll track her down, save her, and\nthen give her a lift back to Skyloft...{[0104|001e]}
CF_23_02	{[0109|0000000c]}Then when we get back, I'll ask her if\nshe wants to make our whole going-out\nthing official, and then the two of us\nwill get some quality time together.
CF_23_03	{[0109|0000000d]}Anyway, the point is your work here is\ndone. I got it covered from here!
CF_24	Now, it's off to find that old lady you\nwere talking about.
CF_24_01	Catch you later, {[0200]}!
CF_25	{[0109|0008170f]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, go quickly! \nCheck on the {color[0000]}sealing spike {color[ffff]}at the \nbottom of the pit.\n\n{[0109|00140b00]}There is nothing natural about these\ntremors. That monster could free itself\nat any moment. Approach the pit with\ncaution!
CF_25_01	{[0109|0e000010]}Go quickly, {[0200]}!\nCheck on the {color[0000]}sealing spike{color[ffff]} at the center\nof the pit.
CF_25_02	{[0109|0e001653]}There is nothing natural about these\ntremors. That monster could free itself\nat any moment. Approach the pit with\ncaution!
CF_25_03	{[0109|0010180f]}{[0200]}, you must seal away\nthe beast as soon as possible!\n\n\nIt has grown stronger since you faced it\nlast. Do not let your guard down.
CF_25_04	{[0109|0010180d]}You do remember how to seal the beast\naway, yes?\n\n\nHit the sealing spike with a Skyward\nStrike!{[0104|001e]} Focus your mind. You have the\npower to do this.
CF_25_05	{[0301]}{[0109|0010180f]}{[0200]}, you must restore\nthe seal that imprisons that \nmonstrosity!\n\nIt has grown stronger since you faced it\nlast. You must always stay on guard.
CF_25_06	{[0109|0010180d]}To break the seal for a third time...\nTruly this is a fearsome beast.\n\n\nBut now you must send it back to\nits prison once more. Restore the\nseal! I know you hold the power.
CF_26	{[0109|00000015]}Whoa! Wh-what's with all the shaking?\n\n\n\nThe whole ground is heaving...\nI thought it was supposed to be solid\ndown here!
CF_26_01	{[0109|04000030]}Whoa! Wh-what's with all the shaking?
CF_26_02	{[0109|04000031]}The whole ground is heaving...\nI thought it was supposed to be solid\ndown here!
CF_27	{[0109|00000031]}Aaaaah!
CF_27_01	{[0109|00000030]}...What are you doing standing there?\nGet your tail down there, and patch up\nthat seal like Grannie told you!\n\nAll you gotta do is whack that spike\nwith a blast from your sword, right?
CF_30	{[0109|0010160d]}Now, {[0200]}!{[0104|001e]}\n\n\n\nStrike the sealing spike with a {color[0000]}Skyward{color[ffff]}\n{color[0000]}Strike{color[ffff]}, and restore the seal! {[0109|00111700]}Quickly!
CF_32_01	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, I have important information\nfor you. The beast you face has a \n{color[0000]}sealing spike{color[ffff]} lodged in its forehead.\n\nYou must not leave this place until you\nhave successfully restored the seal\nthat restrains this beast.
CF_32_02	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, you must not leave this area\nuntil you have restored the seal that\nrestrains this beast.
CF_32_03	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, the beast freed itself again.\nYou must stay here and stand\nagainst it.
CF_32_04	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, you must not leave this area\nuntil you have restored the seal that\nrestrains this beast.
CF_32_05	{[0112|00000001]}Master, it is your destiny to seal away\nthis beast. You must not run from it.
CF_32_06	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, you must not leave this area\nuntil you have restored the seal that\nrestrains this beast.
CF_37	{[0109|0000003d]}{[0108|01cd]}Awwww, c'mon!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00003a00]}{[0108|01cd]}{[0108|01cd]}I couldn't do a thing!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00004000]}{[0108|01cd]}{[0108|02cd]}I'm totally useless!
CF_37_01	{[0109|0000002d]}Sniff...{[0104|001e]} I'm just deadweight.\nWhat kinda use is that to anyone{[0104|001e]}.{[0104|001e]}.{[0104|001e]}.
CF_37_02	{[0109|00000002]}Hey. How goes it, {[0200]}?\nYou know, I've been doing some hard\nthinking lately.\n\nGrannie keeps telling me I got my own\npart to play in this whole thing,\nyou know?\n\nI'm not cut out for slashing and\nskewering monsters with a sword\nlike you, but maybe I don't gotta be.\n\n{[0109|00404200]}I think I got another way to help Zelda.\nI'm gonna do it the “Groose way."\n\n\nI'm not giving you any details right\nnow, but just wait and see. I got\nan idea brewing that'll knock your\ngreen beanie off!
CF_37_03	{[0109|00040202]}I'll help Zelda in my own way.{[0104|001e]}\nYou'll see, {[0200]}.
CF_38	{[0109|18000b52]}Out of the way! Scram!
CF_38_0	{[0109|00000b52]}G-get them!
CF_38_2a	{[0109|00000008]}Whew! Thanks for jumping in there to\nrescue me, bud!
CF_38_2b	{[0109|00080b0a]}Just who were those red pests?\nI did not expect to run into a pack of\nthem in this peaceful forest.\n\n{[0109|00161e00]}Same goes for you. This is the second\ntime I've bumped into one of your kind\ntoday. I tell you, all sorts of weird\nthings are going on lately.\n{[0109|00000b00]}I owe you big for taking care of those\nguys, so let me tell you something\nfascinating.
CF_38_3	{[0109|00080b01]}Hey, bud! I am Gorko the Goron. I am\nresearching the ancient history of\nthese woods here.\n\n{[0109|00001700]}According to the ancient texts, there is\nsome kind of place up above called the\n{color[0000]}Isle of the Goddess{color[ffff]}. Far up in the sky!\n\n{[0109|00000b00]}Apparently, these old statues serve \nas landmarks to those {color[0000]}traveling up to\nthe sky{color[ffff]} or down from this Isle of the\nGoddess place.\n{color[0000]}{[010b|00000004]}{color[ffff]}{color[0000]}If you find one, be sure to examine it {color[ffff]}to\nkeep tabs on the number of landmarks.\nThey are rumored to be quite useful.\n\nSupposedly this statue is special, as it is\nsaid to have the ability to activate all\nthe other statues.\n\n{[0109|00161907]}The whole thing sounds a little\ncrazy, I know, but I for one believe\nit to be true!\n\nOtherwise, why would all these statues\nbe here all over the place?
CF_38_3a	{[0109|00080b07]}According to some of the ancient texts\nI have read, there is a place way up in\nthe sky called the {color[0000]}Isle of the Goddess{color[ffff]}.\n\nOld statues like the one behind me\nwere placed here to provide travelers\nwith a way back up to the island.\n\nMy research seems to suggest this\nparticular statue is special in that\nit alone holds the power to {color[0000]}activate{color[ffff]}\nall the other statues.\n{[0109|00161900]}Hey, I will be the first one to admit it\nsounds like something out of a fairy\ntale, but I am starting to believe it!\n\n{[0109|00000b04]}I mean, if that is not true, then what\nare all these statues doing all over\nthis land?
CF_38_4	{[0109|00181700]}It is a real head-scratcher, bud. Makes\nyou want to know more, does it not?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yeah!{[0101|0000]}Not really...
CF_38_7	{[0109|00151b05]}{[0108|01cd]}GORO!
CF_38_8	{[0109|00131909]}What was THAT?!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00171b08]}The statue just reacted to you! \nWhat did you do? Come on, do not \nmake a big guy beg! I have got to know!
CF_38_9	{[0109|00171b08]}The statue just reacted to you! \nWhat did you do? Come on, do not \nmake a big guy beg! I have got to know!
CF_38_10	{[0109|00151902]}Ah, sounds like I have a fellow\nconnoisseur of ancient cultures here!\n\n\n{[0109|00160b00]}All right, bud, you had better brace\nyourself, because I am about to blow\nyour mind.\n\nSo get this: people actually live on this\nsky island, and they get around by\nflying on the backs of huge birds that\nare way bigger than birds down here!\n{[0109|00001e00]}Up there everyone reveres the goddess,\nand the residents of all the islands\nin the sky live in a perfect society,\ntotally free of conflict or unhappiness!\n{[0109|00000b00]}Not only that, but from what I can tell,\ntheir civilization is way, way more\nadvanced than ours down here.
CF_38_11	{[0109|00080b00]}But it does not even stop there, bud!\nThis Isle of the Goddess has even more\nstuff to marvel at!\n\n{[0109|001f1e00]}The place was crafted by the goddess\nherself, so it figures that it is filled \nwith wonders we do not have here.\n\n{[0109|00001908]}The buildings are all made of gold!\nAn endless spring of mystical water\nfeeds a river through the place. One\nsip of that stuff, and you live forever!\n{[0109|00000b00]}The trees are heavy with plump fruit\nthat cures all disease! The fields are \ncrowded with pumpkins that never rot!\nMagic wildflowers bloom everywhere!\n{[0109|00171900]}And the weather. Oh, the weather, bud!\nNot too hot, not too cold. No chance of\nsweaty heat in this garden paradise!\nThat is the Isle of the Goddess...\n{[0109|00000b05]}{[0108|01cd]}Amazing, right?{[0104|0014]} WRONG!\nIT IS BEYOND AMAZING!\n\n\n{[0109|00211806]}{[0108|02cd]}You want to hear more \nabout it, don't you, bud?\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure!{[0101|0000]}Nah...
CF_38_12	{[0109|00000001]}I have to examine this statue further,\nbud. Who knows what I might find out!
CF_38_13	{[0109|00161e56]}Ah, that so, bud? I was hoping to tell\nyou more, but I guess it can wait.
CF_38_14	{[0109|00271956]}Good to hear, bud! I am completely\nobsessed with this place. I cannot get\nenough of it!\n\n{[0109|00161e00]}I wish I had more to tell you now,\nbut I will need to research these statues\nto learn more.\n\n{[0109|00000b00]}Next time I bump into you, I will give\nyou the latest info!
CF_41	{[0109|00151b09]}{[0108|01cd]}WHOA!
CF_42	{[0109|00131907]}What in the world just happened?\nDid you use some kind of magic?\n\n\n{[0109|00171b08]}The statue reacted the moment you\ngot near it, bud. How crazy is that?
CF_45	{[0301]}{[0200]}, look at the beast's\nforehead! Do you see the {color[0000]}sealing spike{color[ffff]}\nembedded there?\n\n{[0109|0e000013]}Drive the spike back into its head, and\nput a stop to its rampage!
CF_47	{[0109|0e000054]}{[0106|01cd]}It's too late!\n{color[0000]}{[0106|00cd]}All...{[0104|000a]}{[0106|fecd]} All is lost.{color[ffff]}{[0105|00280000]}
Bad_01	{[0109|00000026]}Hey, {[0200]}, the machine's\nall loaded and ready to smash!\n\n\nIf that flabby sack of teeth tries to\nclimb the wall, I can blast it off from\nhere with a bomb!\n\nWhen you want some backup from\nme, just send me the signal with {[0204|1ecd]}!{[0111|10cd]}
Bad_01_02	{[0109|00000026]}Hey, {[0200]}! The machine's\nloaded and ready to bring the boom!\n\n\nWhen you want me to back you up with\na big blast, just send me the signal\nwith {[0204|1ecd]}!{[0111|10cd]}
Bad_02	{[0109|003e4515]}{[0108|01cd]}Oh NO!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00004000]}Not good! The road crumbled, and I\ncan't get to the rest of my bomb stash!\nWhat do I do?!
Bad_02_02	{[0109|003e4026]}{[0301]}{[0200]}! Come up to the\ntemple, and {color[0000]}make your way over\nhere{color[ffff]}. Hustle up!
Bad_03	Awwright! It's time for Groose to\nexplode into action!
Bad_03_02	Adjust the machine's position with {[0204|0ecd]},\nand aim at your target.\n\n\nOnce you finish aiming, press {[0204|29cd]} to\nlaunch a bomb. If it hits, you'll stun\nthe scaly sucker!
Bad_03_03	If you forget the controls, press {[0204|13cd]}\nanytime you're in control of the\n{color[0003]}Groosenator {color[ffff]}to review the basics!{[0111|0bcd]}
Bad_09	{[0109|00000026]}Grannie says that crazy monster we\nsaw could break free again at any time,\nbut we're not going down easy.\n\n{[0109|00004200]}There's nothing I hate more than being\ncaught unprepared, so I'm brewing up\na secret weapon to take on big ugly!\n\n{[0109|0000000f]}It's not ready yet, but you can bet it'll\ngo down in history as a Groose original.
Bad_10	{[0109|00000026]}Look at that. Seems like our ugly\nfriend grew itself a pair of hands.\nGreat timing!\n\nI hope it knows how to catch, because\nmy machine has a mean right arm!\n\n\n{[0109|00424000]}When she's all loaded up, I'll let you\nknow. Until then, do what you need to\ndo to stop it!
Bad_11	{[0109|00000026]}Well, look who's finally back. Good\nthing too, 'cause I was getting tired of\nwaiting to put a hurting on his ugly\nmug!\n{[0109|00044000]}{[0301]}{[0200]}! Let's do this!\nOur game plan is the same as last time.\nYou know what to do!
Bad_11_02	{[0109|00434553]}{[0108|01cd]}WHOA!{[0104|000a]} Since when did it learn\nhow to fly?!\n\n\n{[0109|00424026]}It's headed straight for the temple,\nbut there's no way I'm letting it\nget there!{[0104|0008]} Big ugly's going down\nburning!
Bad_11_03	{[0109|00414043]}Is that it? Man, I thought it was going\nto put up more of a fight. Somebody\nshould really thank the genius who\nmade this machine!\nOK, {[0200]}, time for you to\ngo show big ugly who's boss!
Bad_12_01	{[0109|00044100]}So today's the day I finally get to\nbust out the {color[0000]}Groosenator{color[ffff]}!\n\n\n{[0109|00000300]}Soon as I'm ready to fire, you'll see my\nsignal appear above {[0204|1ecd]}. {[0109|00004000]}Till then, it's\nup to you and that sword of yours to\nkeep that thing away!{[0111|10cd]}
Bad_12_02	{[0109|00000026]}The {color[0000]}Groosenator{color[ffff]} is ready for action!\n\n\n\nJust press {[0204|1ecd]} to set up the shot!{[0111|10cd]}\n\n\n\nAdjust the machine's position with {[0204|0ecd]},\nand aim at your target. Once your shot's\nset, let that scaly creep have it!
Bad_13_01	{[0109|00004226]}Guess it's time for the {color[0000]}Groosenator{color[ffff]}\nto work its magic again!\n\n\nJust like before, you'll see me appear\nabove {[0204|1ecd]} when the machine's ready\nfor action.{[0111|10cd]}\n\n{[0109|00424000]}You and me are going to\ntag team this freak!\nLet's do it, {[0200]}!
Bad_13_02	{[0109|00004026]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, we're in trouble! I\ncan't get to my stash of bombs!\n\n\n{[0109|00204000]}All right...{[0104|0019]} {[0301]}{[0200]}! We've\ngot no choice! You've got to get up onto\nthat ugly thing's head! Quick now!
Bad_14	{[0109|00000026]}Nice work there, {[0200]}!\nCourse, you couldn't've done it without\nme, but no need to thank Groose. \nI know I saved your tail.\nNow let's get that Gate of Time thing\nup and running. I'll go on ahead!
Bad_14_01	{[0109|00000026]}I think I showed that monster who the\nreal boss is, eh? {[0301]}{[0200]}, get\ndown there and seal it away again!\n\nJust zap the spike down there with a\nblast from your sword like last time.
Bad_15	{[0109|00203010]}Whew... I gotta say, {[0200]},\nI thought we were goners this time.\nSorta glad I was wrong about that.\n\n{[0109|00420200]}I'm gonna run ahead to the temple.\nYou should get back there too!
Bad_15_01	{[0109|00000026]}And the day is saved again thanks to\nthe big man. Now get down there, and\nfix that seal before it comes back!
Bad_17	{[0109|00000003]}Want to head to Faron Woods, do you?\n\n\n\nNo sweat. Just hop on into the\n{color[0000]}Groosenator{color[ffff]}, and I'll fling you over!\n{[0100|ffff]}OK!{[0101|0000]}No way.
Bad_17_2	OK. Let me know if you decide you\nwant a “lift" to the forest!
Bad_17_3	{[0109|00000042]}All right! Hop in, and I'll take care of\nthe flingin'. You just worry about\nthe landing...
Bad_17_4	{[0109|00000026]}With my machine, the woods are just\na fling away!{[0105|000a0000]}
Bad_17_6	You stay safe out there!{[0105|001e0000]}
Bad_18_01	{[0301]}{[0200]}, bad news!\nThat beast looks like it's about to break\nfree again!
Bad_18_02	Gotta get into position! Hang tight!
Bad_18_03	{[0109|00000004]}Yo, {[0200]}! \nThis machine of mine can sling you all\nover the land if you're interested in a\nlittle birdless flight.
Bad_18_04	This machine of mine can sling you all\nover the land if you're interested\nin flying without a Loftwing.
Bad_18_05	With a man of my skill at the controls,\nI can guarantee that I won't chuck you\nanywhere boring!\n\nIf you land somewhere you don't know,\nwell, maybe it's a great time to look\naround and explore the place!
Bad_19_01	{[0109|00000026]}So, where you flying to today?\n{[0100|ffff]}The sky!{[0101|ffff]}The surface.{[0102|0000]}Never mind!
Bad_19_02	Somewhere fun in the sky, huh?\nWhat kind of fun are you looking for?\n{[0100|ffff]}Skydiving.{[0101|ffff]}Bug hunting.{[0102|ffff]}Something else...
Bad_19_03	What kind of fun are you looking for?\nAnything in particular?\n{[0100|ffff]}Cutting!{[0101|ffff]}Shooting!{[0102|0000]}Never mind.
Bad_19_03a	Somewhere fun in the sky, eh?\nWhere should I launch you?\n{[0100|ffff]}Skydiving.{[0101|ffff]}Bug hunting.{[0102|ffff]}Cutting.{[0103|0000]}Never mind.
Bad_19_04	Somewhere fun down here, eh?\nWhat kind of fun are you\nlooking for?\n{[0100|ffff]}Lightning Round!{[0101|ffff]}Thrill Digger!{[0102|ffff]}Rickety Coaster!{[0103|0000]}Never mind.
Bad_19_05	{[0109|00420342]}OK, here we go! Hold on to your little\nhat!
Bad_19_06	If you ever want to travel to fun places\nin style, just come see me!
Bad_19_07	{[0109|00000004]}Yo, {[0200]}!\n\n\n\nI decided the best thing for me to do\nis hang back here on the surface\nwith you. Hey, someone's got to do it!
Bad_Boss2_01	{[0109|28000004]}{[0108|01cd]}Hey! {[0301]}{[0301]}{[0200]}!
Bad_Boss2_02	{[0107|2800000f]}Duh huh huh! Try not to drool on your\nshirt as you stare at this amazing\nsuperweapon I've been working on!
Bad_Boss2_03	I call it...the {color[0000]}Groosenator{color[ffff]}!
Bad_Boss2_04	{[0109|28000018]}Leaves you speechless, doesn't it?\nThat's only natural. You wouldn't\nbelieve how much time I put into\nbuilding this beauty.
Bad_Boss2_04_02	Here—check it out!
Bad_Boss2_04_03	{[0109|28404300]}First, I got all the fences cluttering the\narea out of the way. Then I laid down\nrails for her to run on. All by myself,\nof course.\nI don't know what came over me!{[0104|001e]} I had\nno clue I had the talent to make\nsomething like this, you know?\n\n{[0109|28414000]}Anyhow, you just tell me where you\nwant me to place my shots, and I'll\nput a hurting on that ugly monster!
Bad_Boss2_05	{[0109|28044000]}I don't care how beefy you are—you're\nbound to stumble for a few moments\nafter taking one of my big bombs to\nthe body!
Bad_Boss2_06	Hang on, though... That monster\nshowed up a smidge sooner than I\nwas expecting.
Bad_Boss2_07	{[0109|28414000]}There are a few final adjustments I\ngotta make before she can move on\nthe rails I've put down.\n\nI'll call out to you when she's ready for\naction. Till then, do whatever you can\nto hold off that beast!
Bad_Boss3_01	{[0109|28004000]}Feels like that seal is going to give way\nany second.{[0105|001e0000]}
Bad_Boss3_00b	{[0109|28000053]}Whoa!{[0105|001e0000]}
Bad_Boss3_02	{[0109|283e400f]}Uh...but no need to panic!\n\n\n\n{[0109|28410000]}You know what the {color[0000]}Groosenator{color[ffff]} can\ndo, am I right?
Bad_Boss3_03	{[0109|28000000]}As long as I'm at the controls of this\nbombshell beauty, I don't even know\nthe meaning of the word “defeat"!\n\n{[0109|28000200]}Flinging bombs on this monster's face,\ndefending the land... It's my purpose,\nI think. It's why I'm here.
Bad_Boss3_04	{[0109|28000200]}Anyway, {[0200]}, I've got\nwork to do. Try not to get in the way of\nmy shots, OK?
Sword_01_1	{[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}, I'm sensing\na change in the area that was triggered\nby your Skyward Strike.
Sword_01_4	I have also detected an aura that\ncorrelates closely to your Sailcloth.\nI surmise this aura belongs to Zelda.\n\nI can lead you in the direction of this\naura through a process known as\n{[010b|00000004]}{color[0000]}dowsing{color[ffff]}.\n\nWould you like me to explain this\nprocess to you?\n{[0100|ffff]}Please!{[0101|0000]}Nah...
Sword_01_5	{[0112|00000005]}As you wish, Master.\n\n\n\nDowsing is when I detect the presence \nof the aura of something you wish to\nsearch for using the tip of the sword.\n\nThe nearer you are to an object\nemitting the aura in question, the\n{color[0000]}stronger the response will be{color[ffff]}.\n\nThis response manifests itself through\nvibration and sound. The direction of\nthe object emitting the aura is\nindicated by the purple {color[0000]}pointer {color[ffff]}you see.
Sword_01_6	Hold {[0204|10cd]} and select Zelda as your\ndowsing target, then point in the\ndirection you wish to search.{[0111|08cd]}
Sword_01_7	Understood, {[0112|0000000b]}Master.
Sword_02	{[0112|0000000b]}Master, you must seal away the beast\nthat has broken free. Attempting to\nflee from your current situation will\nnot help you accomplish this task.
5-CenterField\501-Inpa.msbt
Inpa_01	{[0109|00000001]}{[0106|fecd]}Ah...{[0104|000f]} The traveler descended from\nthe clouds above. I welcome you,\nchild of fate.
Inpa_01_2	{[0109|00000008]}{[0106|fecd]}Tell me, what is your name?\n\n\n\n...{[0104|0028]}{[0301]}{[0200]}?\nAh, {[0200]}. Good.\nVery good.\n\nI sense you have already gained control\nover the sacred power that fills your\nsword when {color[0004]}pointed skyward{color[ffff]}. The\n{[010b|00000004]}{color[0000]}Skyward Strike{color[ffff]} is yours to command.\n{[0109|0000000b]}It is proof that you are fit to bear the\nblade you carry, the {color[0003]}Goddess Sword{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n{[0106|ffcd]}I have sat here for many years waiting\nfor you to arrive. All so that I could\nfulfill my purpose as your guide.
Inpa_02	You stand under the roof of the Sealed\nTemple, a place built by the goddess\nan eternity ago.\n\nYour arrival here was predestined\nmany, many years ago.\n\n\nThe spirit maiden you seek arrived \nhere shortly before you, descending to\nthis land in a shower of light.\n\nThere's no doubting it. The gears of\nfate have begun to turn.
Inpa_03	{[0109|0000000a]}Yet all is not as it should be. The spirit\nmaiden was not meant to reach this\nland in the manner she did.\n\nI feel an evil power working in the\nshadows. It moves to warp the destiny\nof which you two are a part.
Inpa_03_01	{[0109|000eff08]}{[0301]}{[0200]}...{[0104|001e]}You are concerned\nfor the spirit maiden and seek her\nwhereabouts, yes?\n\n...That is understandable, but for now\nyou must focus on moving forward.\nThat girl has her own purpose she must\npursue, as do you.\nShe set out for {color[0003]}Faron Woods{color[ffff]} to discover\nthat destiny for herself, and you must\nfollow.
Inpa_04	{[0109|000eff00]}Show me your map.
Inpa_05	The {[0204|19cd]} upon your map marks the path\nthat will lead you to {color[0003]}Faron Woods{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nYou will be traveling in unfamiliar\nland. Many monsters have settled here,\nand a map may not prove guidance\nenough for your journey.\nAnd so I will give you the power to \ncreate {color[0000]}beacons{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nWhen a beacon is marked on your map,\na column of light will stand at that \nlocation. It will act as your waypoint \nfrom afar.\nPoint at the {[0204|19cd]} and press {[0204|00cd]} to place\na beacon.{[0111|00cd]}
Inpa_05_02	{[0109|00000003]}Though you cannot see it from where\nwe are, a beacon stands outside to \nguide you. Leave the temple through\nthe front doors, and see for yourself.\nWhen you no longer have a use for\na beacon, you can remove it from your\nmap by pressing {[0204|00cd]}{[0111|00cd]}.\n\nUse your beacons well, and you will\nnever fear getting lost.
Inpa_05_03	{[0109|00000006]}You haven't set a beacon over {[0204|19cd]} yet.\n\n\n\nTo remove a beacon from your map, \npoint at it and press {[0204|00cd]} once more.{[0111|00cd]}\n\n\nIf you aim to be more accurate with\nthe placement of your beacons, zoom in\nwith {[0204|38cd]} before you lay one down.
Inpa_06	{[0109|000eff03]}Go now. You must head into Faron\nWoods and chase after the spirit\nmaiden...the one you call {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}.\n\nOn your way out, take the contents of\nthe {color[0000]}treasure chest{color[ffff]} within this room.\nWhat you find there should prove\nuseful to you on your journey.
Inpa_06_01	Go on now. Point at {[0204|19cd]} and press {[0204|1bcd]} to\nplace a beacon at that location.{[0111|00cd]}
Inpa_06_02	You are ready. Leave through the door\nbefore you, and head into the woods.\nI wish you safe travel.
Inpa_06_03	{[0109|00001303]}The door that leads to Faron Woods\nis open now. Leave through the door\nto my left, and head for the woods.\n\nAll the questions you have now will be\nanswered in time. For now, you must\ngo, {[0200]}. Walk bravely.
Inpa_06_04	{[0109|00001303]}Know that all the questions you have\nnow will be answered in time. For now,\n{[0200]}, go bravely!
Inpa_06_05	{[0109|00000003]}No doubt you've seen the great\nspiraling pit just outside the temple.\nKnow that something sleeps sealed\naway in the depths of that place.\nDo not worry yourself about what\nslumbers there. It will be made known\nto you when the time is right.
Inpa_06_06	{[0109|0000000a]}We shall find more time to talk later.\nFor now, you must go.
Inpa_07	{[0109|0400003d]}Huh? You gotta be kidding me,\nGrannie!
Inpa_07_01	{[0109|04000002]}You're messing with me. Say it again,\nI dare you!
Inpa_08	{[0109|0e00000a]}I only speak the truth. You are not the\none who will save her. The spirit\nmaiden, your {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, can only be\nsaved by another.\nIt has been his fate to do this thing,\nand in doing so save us. As it was\ndecided long before you were brought\ncrying into this world.
Inpa_09	{[0109|0400003e]}{[0108|01cd]}Shut it, Grannie!\n\n\n\nYou obviously don't know me well,\n'cause if you did, you'd know that if\nanyone's gonna save {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, it's\nGroose!\nHow could it not be me? Plus, if it ain't\nme, why would I even be here? Pffft.\nIf I'm not up to the job of being\nthe hero, just who is?
Inpa_09_01	{[0109|0400001e]}Huh?
Inpa_10	{[0109|04003218]}Oh...now I getcha.\n\n\n\n{[0109|040d0a00]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, Grannie here has\nbeen trying to tell me you're gonna be\nthe big hero who rescues Zelda.
Inpa_10_01	{[0109|0400003c]}What a joke! Look, all I've heard so\nfar is a bunch of babbling about\ndestiny, but that's a load of garbage.\n\n{[0109|040b0a00]}I know you, and you're no hero,\nshrimp!
Inpa_10_02	{[0109|04000038]}{[0108|01cd]}Waaaah!{[0105|002d0000]}
Inpa_11	{[0109|0e000008]}Greetings, {[0200]}. Were you\nable to catch up with {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}?
Inpa_12	{[0109|0e0eff05]}Ah, I see. So the guardian was there as\nwell, was she?\n\n\nThe one you saw by Zelda's side is\nknown as {color[0003]}Impa{color[ffff]}. She is a being sent\nforth by the {color[0003]}goddess {color[ffff]}to aid Zelda in \nher quest.
Inpa_13	The two have traveled somewhere in\norder to accomplish the great task\ndestiny has set before them.\n\nHowever, now that Impa has destroyed\nthe gate that they used, there is only\none way left to find them.
Inpa_14	{[0109|0e0eff00]}You must make use of the {color[0003]}harp {color[ffff]}given\nto you by Zelda.
Inpa_15	{[0109|0e000004]}Come back, {[0200]}!\nThe disturbance we're feeling is not in\nthat direction.
Inpa_16	Hurry. Take the door across from me,\nand see what is happening outside!
Inpa_17	...Do you need to equip yourself before\nfacing the unknown? Very well. I will\nnot stop you, but you must hurry back!
Inpa_21	{[0109|00000003]}When the three sacred flames have\nimbued your sword, only then will the\nGate of Time open for you.\n\nThe clue that will lead you to the\nflames is woven into the song of your\nhomeland known as the {color[0000]}Ballad of the\nGoddess{color[ffff]}. You must return to Skyloft!
Inpa_22	{[0109|0000000a]}The seal's strength will not last. Sooner\nor later the great beast shall break its\nshackles once more.\n\nFortunately, I hear Groose has been\nhard at work preparing something for\nits next assault.\n\n{[0301]}{[0200]}, you must move fast.\nYou must imbue your sword with the\npower of the three sacred flames.
Inpa_26	The “{color[0003]}Ballad of the Goddess{color[ffff]}." Based on\nmy projections, this is likely the song\nZelda sang on the day of the Wing\nCeremony.\nI calculate an 85% probability that\nsomeone associated with the academy\nwill be able to provide additional\ninformation about this song.
Inpa_37	{[0109|0010160f]}Ah, your sword!\n\n\n\n{[0109|00000b00]}There can be no doubt. The sacred\nflames have purified this blade.\nWell done, {[0200]}. That\nsword holds tremendous power.
Inpa_38	{[0109|0001ff07]}That power is a sacred {color[0000]}force{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n\n{[0109|00000b00]}It is a divine power left to us by the\ngods of old. The same power that is\nspoken of in the Ballad of the Goddess.\n\nTo look upon you is to see that same\ngreat power, now flowing through you\nand the sword you carry.
Inpa_39	{[0109|00001603]}Come, {[0200]}. You must\nnow open the Gate of Time.
Inpa_39_01	Now that the sacred {color[0000]}force{color[ffff]} dwells\nwithin your blade, strike the Gate of\nTime with a {color[0000]}Skyward Strike {color[ffff]}and\nit will surely awaken.
Inpa_39_02	Climb upon the pedestal, and {color[0004]}show\nthe gate your sword's power{color[ffff]}!
Inpa_39_03	{[0109|00000007]}Now that the sacred force dwells within\nyour blade, hit the Gate of Time with\na {color[0000]}Skyward Strike{color[ffff]} and it will surely\nawaken.\nClimb upon the pedestal, and {color[0004]}show\nthe gate your sword's power{color[ffff]}!
Bad_10	{[0109|00000004]}Yo, {[0200]}! Saw the rail\ntrack I put up outside, eh?\n\n\n{[0109|00000b00]}What's it for? Duh huh... Oh, you'll see\nbefore long!
Inpa_40_01	{[0109|040a321f]}{[0108|01cd]}WHOA-HO!{[0105|001e0000]}
Inpa_40_02	{[0109|0e00000a]}No... I fear the {color[0000]}seal has given way once\nagain{color[ffff]}. That {color[0000]}terrible beast{color[ffff]} is awakening\neven as we speak.\n\nIt is likely that the monster reacted to\nthe sacred power given off by your\nsword.\n\n{[0109|0e010b00]}I wish it had not happened, but there\nwas no other way to open the gate.\nSo it goes...
Inpa_41_1	{[0109|0e101600]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, you must imprison\nthe beast once again.
Bad_11	{[0109|0400030d]}All right! Bring it on!
Bad_12	{[0109|040f2f0f]}This is what I've been waiting for.\nIt's time to break out my new toy!\nTrust me, that flabby bag of teeth\ndoesn't stand a chance.\n{[0109|040b3101]}Well? What are we waiting for?\nI'm heading out there!
Inpa_42	{[0109|0000000a]}The beast is awakening from its\nslumber.\n\n\n{[0301]}{[0200]}, you must seal the\nbeast away once more!
Inpa_43	{[0109|0e00000a]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, you must not loose\nanother {color[0000]}Skyward Strike {color[ffff]}now!\n\n\nWere you to do so, it could speed up the\nmonster's awakening.\n\n\nWe will return to the gate later. For\nthe moment, you must focus your\nefforts on {color[0000]}restoring the seal{color[ffff]} that\nholds the beast captive.
Inpa_45	{[0109|0e000003]}It seems you were successful in\nimprisoning the monster again.
Inpa_45_01	You have my thanks,\n{[0200]}.
Inpa_45_02	As do you, {color[0003]}Groose{color[ffff]}.
Inpa_45_03	I do not wish to dwell on what may have\nhappened if you two hadn't been here.
Inpa_46	{[0109|0400000d]}Duh huh, aww...you give me too much\ncredit, Grannie.\n\n\nYou were the one who got me to stop\nfeeling sorry for myself and put my\nenergy into doing what I could to help.
Inpa_47	{[0109|0e080b0b]}I did what was necessary to get you to\nrealize your full potential.
Inpa_48	{[0109|0e000007]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, you must wonder\njust what it is you've been fighting out\nthere in the great pit.\n\nThere is much I could tell you, but\nsuffice to say it is the root of the evil\nwe face. When you pass through the\nGate of Time, you shall learn more.\n{[0109|0e010b00]}We may seal it and reseal it into its\nprison a thousand times, but it will\nalways shatter the bonds that confine\nit. Such is its awesome power.\nWe must destroy it at its source or\nsuffer this fate again and again.\n\n\n{[0109|0e100b00]}There is no time to lose. Hit the gate\nwith a Skyward Strike.
Inpa_50	{[0109|040d0206]}Come on, already! Charge that sword\nof yours with that sacred force stuff\nGrannie was talkin' about, and {color[0004]}zap{color[ffff]} the\nGate of Time!
Inpa_50_01	Right, Grannie?
Inpa_51	{[0109|0e010007]}...Indeed. Now, {[0200]}, go.\nGo to the gate.
Inpa_52	{[0109|00100003]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, it is time!\nOpen the Gate of Time, and travel\nto the other side.
Inpa_53	{[0109|00101606]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, what are you doing?\nDid you meet with Zelda on the other\nside of the door?\n\n{[0109|00140b00]}If not, you must go back through!
Bad_13	{[0109|000c020d]}Come on, already! Charge that sword\nof yours with that sacred force stuff\nGrannie was talkin' about, and {color[0004]}zap{color[ffff]} the\nGate of Time!\nI bet you {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}'s just on the other side\nof that gate, wonderin' where you are.\nYou shouldn't make the little lady\nwait, {[0200]}! Go on!
Bad_14	{[0109|000c0206]}I bet you {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}'s just on the other side\nof that gate, wondering where you are.\nYou shouldn't make the little lady\nwait, {[0200]}! Go on!
Inpa_54	{[0109|0e010103]}So you've returned.
Inpa_55	Then you know everything...
Inpa_55_01	On the other side of that gate, {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}\nwaits, suspended in a sleep without end.\nBut do not despair, for she is still\nalive and well.
Inpa_56	True to legend, the Triforce is the one\nthing with the power to vanquish\nDemise. It is thought to have been\nhidden within Skyloft by the goddess. \n{[0109|0e010b00]}Sadly, that is all we know of where it\nrests. {[0104|000f]}All other clues to its whereabouts\nhave been lost to the ages.
Inpa_56_01	{[0109|0e140b00]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, you have likely\ncome to the same conclusion, but I will\nspell it out just the same.\n\nThe key to finding the Triforce must\nbe in {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.
Inpa_57	{[0109|0e080b07]}Go now, {[0200]}. \nFind the Triforce.
Inpa_58	The clues to finding the Triforce are\nin Skyloft.\n\n\n{[0109|0e000007]}Go forth and find the Triforce.
Bad_15	{[0109|0401ff04]}{[0108|01cd]}Whoa! Whoa there! Hold up!
Bad_15_01	{[0109|0403ff00]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, there's something I\ngotta tell you.
Bad_15_02	{[0109|0403ff02]}So, Zelda... How's she holding up?\nWas she OK when you saw her?\n\n{[0100|ffff]}She's great!{[0101|ffff]}Actually...
Bad_15_03	She was? Oh, good to hear.\n\n\n\n{[0109|04030200]}...But she's still stuck there till this\nwhole mess blows over, huh?
Bad_15_04	{[0109|04001400]}That's terrible. It's gotta be so hard for\nthe poor girl.\n\n\n{[0109|04030200]}But you're going to do something about\nthis mess, right?
Bad_16	{[0109|040e0d09]}{[0301]}{[0200]}...I've made up my\nmind. I'm not going back.\n\n\n{[0109|04000200]}I'm staying right here with Grannie.
Bad_16_01	{[0109|0400ff0d]}Aww, don't look so bummed out. Do I\nlook sad? Nah, I'm doing what I want\nto do!\n\n{[0109|04000200]}I don't know how to explain it. I got\nthis feeling in my belly that there's\nwork to do here.\n\nSomeone's gotta watch that big, ugly\nmonster,{[0109|04000211]} and someone's gotta make\nsure Grannie's doing all right.\n\nIt ain't as action packed as what you're\ndoing, but maybe this is my destiny.\nKnow what I mean?
Bad_16_02	{[0109|04030d08]}Besides, it's not so bad here. Living up\nin the sky was OK, I guess, but don't\nyou just love the way it smells down\nhere? What? That's not weird to say!
Bad_16_03	{[0109|040d0209]}Check it out.
Bad_16_04	{[0109|04040208]}Zelda and Grannie have brought life\nback to the land here.\n\n\nI bet even the weakest {color[0000]}sapling {color[ffff]}could\ngrow into one beast of a tree in soil\nlike this. It'd brighten this place up a\nlittle too.\n{[0109|040d0211]}I mean, sure, it'd take a few years for\nit to grow, but as far as I'm concerned,\nI got nothing but time.\n\n{[0109|04000012]}It's weird to say out loud, but that's\njust how I feel right now.
Bad_16_05	{[0109|040d022e]}So...yeah...you know. When you get\nback to Skyloft, do me a favor and let\npeople know I'm doing OK down here.\n\n{[0109|04000e00]}Cawlin and Strich might get a little\nemotional since they look up to me,\nbut you tell them I'm happy, OK?\n\n{[0109|04000209]}Thanks, {[0200]}.
Bad_20	{[0109|00000002]}Don't let me down. I'm counting on\nyou to help {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}, {[0200]}!\n\n\nOh, by the way, I've been thinking\nabout how nice it'd be to have a {color[0000]}tree\n{color[ffff]}here, but I don't have a seedling or\nanything. You seen one I can plant?
Bad_21	{[0109|000d022e]}It's great to finally get a sapling here\nand all,{[0104|0014]} but it's going to take {color[0000]}ages {color[ffff]}to\nget this thing to grow tall!
Bad_22	{[0109|000d0f0a]}Oh yeah! Now this is a tree I could\nlook at all day! It's like a symbol for\nthis temple...or something!\n\n{[0109|00030200]}Every time I stare at it, my jaw starts\nhanging open and I get this weird,\nhappy feeling.
Bad_23	{[0109|000d0204]}Hey, {[0200]}, now that is a\nserious seedling. Why didn't you tell\nme you had that thing on you?\n\n{[0109|00000e0e]}I'm no expert, but it seems like the\nperfect fit for this temple. If you\nplant it here, it'll grow for sure.\n\n{[0109|00030200]}Only downside is, {[0104|000a]}it's gonna take\nbasically forever for a seedling that\nbig to grow into a full tree.
Bad_24	{[0109|00000000]}You gotta chase after that creep,\n{[0200]}! {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}'s counting\non you!
Inpa_59	{[0109|00000005]}You seek the dragons? When the Song\nof the Hero is complete, the path to\nthe Triforce shall be illuminated?\nThen take care and be on your way!
Inpa_60	{[0109|0000000a]}That terrible {color[0000]}monster{color[ffff]} begins to stir yet\nagain! It appears that even though\nZelda has lent her power to strengthen\nit, the seal will soon reach its limit.\nSo be it. You and Groose must work\ntogether to beat that foul beast back\ninto its prison and restore the seal!
Inpa_61	{[0109|0000000a]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, work with Groose to\nimprison that monster once more!
Inpa_62	{[0109|00000005]}Searching after the three dragons, are\nyou? I seem to recall a dragon who\nlived in the far reaches of the desert...
Inpa_63	{[0109|0e000003]}The beast has been sealed into its\nprison for a third time.
Inpa_63_01	{[0301]}{[0200]}, Groose... You have\nboth done well.\n\n\nBut I fear we can't dwell on your\nsuccess. The strength of the seal\nseems to wane with each escape.\n\nWe are almost out of time,\n{[0200]}. Are you close to\ndiscovering the Triforce?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes!{[0101|ffff]}Actually...
Inpa_64	{[0104|0019]}...I see. You must seek out the three\ndragons and complete the Song of the\nHero to find the Triforce.\n\nIt is right your search led you here.\nThe {color[0003]}Faron Woods{color[ffff]} are close by.\n\n\n{[0109|0e00000a]}Unfortunately, there has been an\nunusual turn of events in the woods...\n\n\n{[0109|0e010b00]}I am unsure of what happened, but a\nshort while ago, I noticed the path to\nthe woods was completely flooded.
Inpa_64_01	To protect the land here, I closed the\n{color[0000]}gate leading to the woods{color[ffff]} and drove\nback the water with a simple seal.\n\nThe seal will only hold as long as the\ngate remains closed, meaning you\nwill not be able to open it without\nflooding these lands.\nGiven this situation, I am at a loss\nas to how you can enter the woods. 
Inpa_65	{[0109|0400000d]}Heh! Is that all? Consider the problem\nsolved!\n\n\nSee, that last battle with big ugly got\nme thinking about other ways to use\nthe {color[0000]}Groosenator{color[ffff]}!\n\nJust climb up into that bad boy, and I'll\ngive you a “lift" over to the woods,\nall right?
Inpa_65_01	{[0109|040c0202]}I'll run ahead and get her prepped for\nyou! Come see me when you're ready\nto take a little flight.
Inpa_66	{[0109|0e00000b]}Oh my...\n\n\n\nThe boy has made himself very useful,\nbut he does have a tendency to cause\ntrouble for those he “helps"...
Inpa_66_01	{[0109|0e08ff00]}Safe journey. I wish you a soft landing,\n{[0200]}.
Inpa_67	{[0109|00000003]}{color[0003]}Groose {color[ffff]}shall assist you in making your\nway to the woods.\n\n\nSomething may have happened to the\n{color[0000]}Water Dragon of the woods{color[ffff]}. When you\narrive, seek her out!
Inpa_68	{[0109|00000007]}So that's what happened to the woods?\nI am glad to hear that everything has\nreturned to normal.
Inpa_68_01	{[0109|0000000a]}You must continue to gather the parts\nof the {color[0000]}Song of the Hero{color[ffff]}. Time is\nshort!
Inpa_69	{[0109|00000003]}Ah, {[0200]}, I'm glad you are\nhere. {color[0003]}Groose {color[ffff]}has been waiting for you.\n\n\nHe stands outside {color[0000]}by his catapult{color[ffff]}.\nGo speak with him. 
Inpa_69_01	{[0109|00000003]}{color[0003]}Groose {color[ffff]}waits for you outside {color[0000]}by his\ncatapult{color[ffff]}. Go speak with him.
Inpa_69_02	{[0109|00000003]}By the way, {[0200]},\n{color[0003]}Groose {color[ffff]}is waiting for you.\n\n\nHe proudly stands outside {color[0000]}by his\ncatapult{color[ffff]}. Go speak with him.
Inpa_70	{[0109|0000000a]}When you have passed the final trial,\nyou will finally be worthy to receive\nthe power of the Triforce.\n\nHurry back to Skyloft. Whatever\nawaits you in the final trial, you must\nnot fail!
Inpa_70_01	{[0109|00000014]}Oh, {[0200]}! You've learned\nthe parts of the song from the three\ndragons. There's not much time left!\n\nHurry! Return to the sky and complete\nthe Song of the Hero.
Inpa_71	{[0109|0000000a]}The time has finally come.\n\n\n\nGo now, {[0200]}. Seek out\nthe Triforce in Skyloft!
Inpa_72	{[0109|00000009]}For {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} to be taken from us at a time\nlike this... It is unthinkable!\n\n\n{[0301]}{[0200]}, listen to me! You\nmust do whatever it takes to prevent\nthe resurrection of Demise in the past!\n\nQuickly now! Open the Gate of Time\nand return to the past!
Inpa_73	{[0109|0000000d]}{[0301]}{[0200]}, listen to me! You\nmust do whatever it takes to prevent\nthe resurrection of Demise in the past!\n\nQuickly now! Open the Gate of Time\nand return to the past!
Inpa_74	{[0109|00000009]}No! So Demise has already been\nresurrected... If we do not stop him,\nthis world is doomed.
Inpa_76	{[0109|0000000a]}I have no other words for you,\n{[0200]}. Know now that you\nare the sole hope for the survival\nof this land.\nThe danger is overwhelming, but you\nmust persevere. You must save our\nworld!
Inpa_77	{[0109|00000014]}Groose left the temple through the\nfront door a few moments ago!\n\n\nI imagine he's out by his {color[0000]}catapult{color[ffff]},\nlike always.
Harp_00	{[0109|0e000008]}...Tell me, {[0200]}, have you\nattempted to play the harp that\nyou received?\n\nMy sense is that you have not yet\nfamiliarized yourself with it. \n\n\nVery well, I shall teach you how to\nplay it. Listen well and do as I say.\n\n\nFirst, press {[0204|1ecd]} to ready your harp.{[0111|10cd]}
Harp_01	Now try strumming your harp.
Harp_02	Press {[0204|1ecd]} to take out your harp.
Harp_04	{color[0004]}Slow your strums{color[ffff]} so that they match\nthe swaying of my {color[0000]}braid{color[ffff]}.
Harp_05	{color[0004]}Play faster{color[ffff]}, so that your strums move\nin time with my {color[0000]}braid{color[ffff]}.
Harp_06	{[010b|00000006]}Good. You learn fast.\n\n\n\nNow for your next lesson.
Harp_07	Focus and play in time with the pulsing\nof the {color[0000]}circle of light{color[ffff]}.\n\n\nWhen your timing is right, I shall join\nmy voice to your harp.\n\n\nListen well, for the song I sing will be\nof great help to you in your journey.
Harp_11	{color[0004]}Strum{color[ffff]} more {color[0004]}slowly{color[ffff]} to stay in time with\nthe {color[0000]}circle of light{color[ffff]}.
Harp_12	{color[0004]}Strum {color[ffff]}a bit {color[0004]}faster {color[ffff]}to stay in time with\nthe {color[0000]}circle of light{color[ffff]}.
Harp_15	{color[0004]}Point the Joy-Con (R) forward{color[ffff]}\nto ready the harp to play!
Harp_16	Close, but you must {color[0004]}strum it more\nbroadly{color[ffff]}!
Chair_1_1_1	{[0104|001e]}{[0106|ffcd]}...
Chair_1_2_1	Hard to leave the old girl all to herself\nhere...\n\n\n{[0109|00000a00]}But don't you dare go telling Cawlin\nand Strich that I'm down here taking\ncare of some little old lady!
Chair_1_2_2	Blah, this place is pretty barren.\nConsidering how long she's been here,\nyou'd think Grannie would've tried to\ndecorate a little.\nI guess she likes the all-stone motif.\nAt the very least she could've tried\nplanting a tree or something to liven\nthe place up.
Chair_1_2_4	Is this tree something or what?!\nNo wonder it's called the Life Tree!
Chair_2_1_1	{[0106|ffcd]}I do hope you are able to catch\nup with Zelda...
Chair_2_2_1	{[0106|fecd]}.{[0104|000a]}.{[0104|000a]}.
Chair_2_4_1	{[0106|ffcd]}This temple used to be a place of great\npeace and solitude, but life has taken\nquite a turn lately.\n\nStill, now is not the time for thoughts\nlike these.\n\n\nNot when my worst fears are coming\nto pass...
Chair_2_5_1	{[0106|ffcd]}That red-haired fellow is really quite\nhandy.\n\n\nSome areas of the temple are badly in\nneed of repair. Perhaps he can assist\nme in that work...
Fay_01	My analysis indicates this location is\nideally suited to growing your seedling.\n\n\nHowever, I project that planting the\nseedling in {color[0000]}this time {color[ffff]}will make it take\nfar too long for the seedling to grow\ninto a tree capable of producing fruit.

CFB_01	{[0109|00000001]}...At last. I've been expecting you,\n{[0200]}.\n\n\nYou are doubtless overwhelmed, so I\nwill explain things as simply as I can.
CFB_02	This is the{color[0000]} Temple of Hylia{color[ffff]}, though it \nwill come to be known as the {color[0003]}Sealed\nTemple{color[ffff]} sometime in the future.\n\nYou stand in the past, ages before your\nown time. Here the goddess, Hylia,\nhas only just sealed away {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}...\n\nAnd little time has passed since the\ngoddess sent the outcropping of rock\ninto the sky that would one day\nbecome Skyloft.
CFB_03	{[0109|0f0f0703]}It is true to its name. You have passed\nthrough the Gate of Time to an era\nin the distant past.\n\nYou will have many questions. But for\nnow, you must proceed back through\nthe great doors behind you.
CFB_04	It is there that the person you've risked\nlife and blood to defend waits for you.
CFB_05	{[0109|00000003]}You stand in the past, ages before your\nplace in time. Here, the goddess, Hylia,\nhas only just sealed away {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}...\n\nYou will have many questions. But for\nnow, you must proceed through the\ngreat doors at the back of the room.\n\nIt is there that the person you've risked\nlife and blood to defend waits for you.\n
CFB_18	{[0109|00000003]}I see you've said good-bye.\n\n\n\nNow you must keep the promise you\nmade to her. You must find the\n{color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}.\n\nReturn to your time. There is work to\nbe done there.
CFB_19	{[0109|0000000a]}Do not fear for {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}. I will watch\nover her here. Go now and fulfill\nyour destiny.
CFB_25	{[0104|000f]}.{[0104|000f]}.{[0104|000f]}.{[0109|000f0803]}Hmm...\n\n\n{[0100|ffff]}What's up?{[0101|ffff]}See you later.
CFB_26	{[0109|00000703]}Oh, it's a matter of no great concern...
CFB_27	Hmm...
CFB_28	Do you see that sunny patch of earth\nover there?\n\n\nI thought it might be nice to plant a\ntree of some sort there.\n\n\nI imagine it would please {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]} greatly\nto see a great tree welcoming her\nback when she wakes from her slumber.
CFB_29	Sadly, it's a rare tree that grows strong\nfor thousands of years on end. If only\nI could find the {color[0000]}seedling{color[ffff]} of such a\nhearty specimen...
CFB_30	{[0109|00000003]}A tree that grows strong for thousands\nof years... If only I could find the\n{color[0000]}seedling{color[ffff]} of such a tree...
CFB_31	{[0109|0000000b]}Ah, you've planted a seedling!\n\n\n\nI sense great vitality in this sprout.\nWith any luck, it shall grow into a stout\ntree that will live on for millennia.
CFB_31_01	{[0109|00000003]}I sense great vitality in this sprout.\nWith any luck, it shall grow into a stout\ntree that will live on for millennia.
CFB_32	{[0109|00000001]}You've yet to complete the great \nmission entrusted to you.\n\n\nFor Zelda, who still waits in everlasting\nslumber, you must fulfill the destiny\nthat is only yours to complete.
CFB_33	{[0109|00000012]}Urgh... {[0104|000a]}{[0200]}...?\nIt's Ghirahim...{[0104|000a]} He appeared out of\nthin air and got the drop on me.\n\nDon't worry about me... You must\nchase after him!
CFB_33_01	He ran through the {color[0000]}great doors {color[ffff]}{color[0000]}at the\nfront of the temple{color[ffff]}. You may yet catch\nhim before it's too late. Hurry!
CFB_33_02	{[0109|00000012]}{color[0003]}Ghirahim {color[ffff]}ran through the {color[0000]}great doors\nat the front of the temple{color[ffff]}. If you\nhurry, you may yet stop him!
CFB_34	{[0109|00070c0b]}Do not panic. {color[0003]}Zelda {color[ffff]}is fine. She rests in\nthe back room of the temple.\n\n\n{[0109|000f0700]}I never expected {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]} would rise\nagain. {[0104|000a]}It seems now that the fate of the\nworld rests solely in your hands,\n{[0109|00000706]}{[0200]}!
CFB_35	{[0109|00070c04]}Do not panic. {color[0003]}Zelda {color[ffff]}is fine. She rests\nin the back room of the temple.\n\n\n{[0109|00000706]}Focus on the battle at hand. Defeat\nDemise and save our world,\n{[0200]}.
CFB_BAD_01	{[0109|000e020d]}Phew! That was WAY too close back\nthere. I got a serious sweat going!\n\n\n{[0109|00000200]}Can you imagine what would've\nhappened if I hadn't pulled off one of\nmy famous Groose maneuvers to\ncatch {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}?\n{[0109|00000200]}I'll stay here and make sure she's\nprotected, so don't worry about her\none bit. Just get out there and clobber\nthat Demise creep!\n{[0109|00000203]}I'm counting on you,\n{[0200]}! We all are!
CFB_BAD_02	You gotta get out there and whale on\n{color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]} until he cries like a creepy\nlittle baby!\n\n{[0109|00000003]}I'm counting on you, \n{[0200]}! We all are!
CFB_SWORD_00	{[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}, I have\nimportant information for you.\n\n\nOnce you enter this portal, my analysis\nindicates a 0% chance that you will be\nable to return, unless you are able\nto vanquish your foe.\nAre you ready to proceed?\n{[0100|ffff]}I'm ready!{[0101|0000]}Not yet...
CFB_SWORD_01	{[0112|00000005]}Understood, Master. When you are\nready to proceed, please return to this\nlocation.
CFB_SWORD_02	{[0112|00000005]}Understood, Master {[0200]}.{[0104|000f]}\nKnow that even in the place that lies\nbeyond this portal, I will be with you...\n\n{[0112|00000001]}And, Master...{[0104|001e]}good luck.
CFB_SWORD_03	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, do you wish\nto retreat temporarily in order to\nresupply yourself for the final battle?\n{[0100|ffff]}Yes!{[0101|0000]}I'm fine.
CFB_SWORD_03_01	{[0112|00000005]}Understood, Master. Please return\nhere when your preparations are\ncomplete.
CFB_SWORD_03_02	{[0112|00000005]}Understood, Master.
CFB_SWORD_04	{[0112|00000004]}Master {[0200]}, have you\nfinished with your preparations for\nthe battle ahead?\n{[0100|ffff]}All ready!{[0101|0000]}Not yet...
CFB_SWORD_04_01	{[0112|00000005]}Yes, Master. Let us proceed to the\nbattle at once.
CFB_SWORD_04_02	{[0112|00000005]}Understood, Master. Return when you\nare fully prepared for the fight ahead.

N_GORO01	{[0109|00000001]}Oh, hey, bud! We meet again! In a\nhurry as usual, eh?\n\n\n{[0109|001b1300]}Yup, I have been keeping busy too,\nchecking out the wonders of the world.\n\n\n{[0109|000e1300]}Say, you want to hear about some\nof my research?\n{[0100|ffff]}Sure!{[0101|0000]}Nah...
N_GORO01_01	{[0109|00250e05]}Oh, that is too bad. Well, if you ever \nget in a researchy kind of mood, you\nknow where to find me.
N_GORO01_02	{[0107|000e1908]}OK, bud, prepare to be amazed!\nI made a huge discovery while I was\nout doing my field research.\n\nSo get a load of this... Apparently,\nthere are {color[0000]}walls {color[ffff]}and {color[0000]}statues{color[ffff]} that\nrespond to {[0107|00001300]}{color[0000]}beautiful tones{color[ffff]}!\n\n{[0107|000e1300]}Wild, right? Want to know more?\n{[0100|ffff]}Of course!{[0101|0000]}Nah...
N_GORO01_03	{[0109|00251356]}It is sort of embarrassing to admit, but \nthat is all I have figured out so far. \nBut, hey, I just started my research!\n\n{[0109|000e1300]}If you find yourself still hankering to\nlearn more, come back and talk to me\nagain later!\n\n{[0109|00001300]}Meanwhile, I will keep trying to dig\nup more information!
N_GORO02	{[0109|000e1904]}ALL RIGHT! That is the kind of\narchaeological enthusiasm I like to see!\n\n\n{[0109|00001900]}Oh, but before we get into the\nfascinating details of {color[0000]}walls{color[ffff]} and {color[0000]}statues{color[ffff]},\nthere is something I had better ask you\nabout, bud.\n{[0109|000e0b00]}You ever heard of a {color[0003]}Blessed Butterfly{color[ffff]}?\n{[0100|ffff]}I've seen one!{[0101|0000]}Nope.
N_GORO02_01	{[0109|000e1300]}Oh! Right, so a {color[0003]}Blessed Butterfly{color[ffff]} is\nthis kind of pretty, blue butterfly!\n\n\n{[0109|001b1300]}You may not believe it, but they are\nsuper hardy. They live in all kinds of\nplaces you would never expect.\n\n{[0109|000e1300]}Even in a land like this, you will see\nplenty of them!
N_GORO02_02	All right, bud, then let me jump\nstraight to the point.
N_GORO02_03	{[0109|000a1304]}Ancient tomes mention these\nbutterflies flapping around in packs\nby certain walls and statues!\n\nSeems like these butterflies have some\nkind of sixth sense. They are detecting,\nuh...something! Want to hear more?\n{[0100|ffff]}Please!{[0101|0000]}Enough.
N_GORO02_04	{[0109|000e1300]}Which are you interested in?\n{[0100|ffff]}Walls.{[0101|ffff]}Statues.
N_GORO02_05	{[0109|00000001]}The writings claim that the statues\nappear out of nowhere with a\n“boing-oing" sound and speak a\nstrange language!\nCan you believe it, buddy? {color[0000]}Talking\nstatues{color[ffff]}! I know you want to hear more\nabout this!\n{[0100|ffff]}Tell me!{[0101|0000]}No, thanks.
N_GORO02_06	{[0109|00000001]}From what I have learned, it sounds\nlike these walls were left behind by\nthe goddess for the hero mentioned\nin legends!\nThe things the hero desires are said to\nspring forth from behind the walls.\nThat is why they call them {color[0000]}goddess\nwalls{color[ffff]}, I suppose. Hungry to hear more?\n{[0100|ffff]}Of course!{[0101|0000]}Sorry...

Demo43_01:03	The behemoth you beat back into\nconfinement is a horror of unspeakable\npower.\n\nJudging by what I saw, I would not be\nsurprised if the seal gave way again\nsoon.
Demo43_01:04	So you are left with precious little time\nto complete the task with which you\nhave been entrusted.\n\nReturn to the Sealed Temple,\n{[0200]}. There is much to\ndiscuss.
Demo43_02:01	...As you can see, the gate is nothing\nmore than a slab of cold stone for now.\nIt is sleeping.\n\nRousing it from its slumber would \nrequire great power.\n\n\nYes, I believe a shot of holy light from\nyour {color[0000]}Skyward Strike{color[ffff]} might just do it...
Demo43_02:02	Ah, sorry to disappoint you, boy, but\nfor now your sword lacks the power\nnecessary to awaken the gate.\n\nFirst, you and your sword must grow\ntogether.

Demo43_02:04	Clues to finding the sacred flames \nhave been woven into the lyrics of a \nsong precious to your people,\nthe {color[0000]}Ballad of the Goddess{color[ffff]}{[010b|00000004]}.\nThese clues are your best hope of\nfinding your way to the flames.\n\n\nReturn to {color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}. Somewhere on your\nisland is one whose {color[0000]}knowledge {color[ffff]}of this\nold song will point you in the right\ndirection.
Demo43_02:05	I hate even sayin' this, but I guess you\ngot it all figured out, Grannie.\n\n\nMe, well, there's nothin' I can do to\nhelp {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}. I'm useless.
Demo43_02:06	Ah. You sell yourself short, my friend.\nYou'll see in time that you have your\nown role to play in all this.
Demo43_02:07	{[0301]}{[0200]}, go now.\nTrust in fate to guide your feet. \nYour mission depends on it...as does\nZelda's fate.
Demo59_01:01	Do not fear it. This is what we have\nwaited for. At long last, the gate has\nbeen reactivated.
Demo59_01:02	Standing before you is a path that\ntranscends the flow of time. It is a\nportal to the past...to the very place\nwhere {color[0003]}Zelda {color[ffff]}now waits.
Demo59_01:03	Go bravely, {[0200]}.\nIf everything is as I suspect, the\nreunion with Zelda you've fought so \nhard for lies beyond this gate. 
Demo59_01:04	Nah, don't worry about me.\nI'm gonna hang back here,\n{[0200]}.
Demo59_01:10	That stupid monster doesn't know when\nto quit, and Grannie here keeps\nyapping on and on about how we never\nknow when it might bust free again.
Demo59_01:05	Someone's gotta stick around and\nguard the place. Might as well be me.
Demo59_01:06	Besides, if I'm not here, who's gonna\nlook out for the old girl?
Demo59_01:08	{[0105|00370000]}And you know what...
Demo59_01:07	Naw, forget about it...{[0105|00870000]} 
Demo59_01:09	When you see Zelda, tell her I said\n“What's up?"
Demo62_01:01	You've come so far,\n{[0200]}...\nI'm glad you made it.
Demo62_01:03	I imagine Impa filled you in on\neverything. We've traveled very far\nfrom home...to the distant past.\n\nIn this era, the wounds inflicted on the\nland during the battle between the\ngoddess and the demon king known as\n{color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]} have not yet healed.\nAll the fairy tales about that war we\nheard growing up in Skyloft... \nIncredible as it may seem, they appear\nto be all too real.
Demo62_01:04	I think it's time you learned the whole\nstory. Let me try to explain...
Demo62_01:05	The old gods created a {color[0000]}supreme power\n{color[ffff]}that gave anyone who possessed it the\nability to shape reality and fulfill any\ndesire. They called it{[0104|001e]} {color[0002]}the Triforce{color[ffff]}.\nIn his thirst to make the world his own,\n{color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]} readied a massive army of\nmonsters for war. He sought to take\nthe Triforce for himself by force.\nThe goddess feared for her people.\nShe used her power to send both them\nand the Triforce into the sky on a slice\nof earth she cut away from the land.\nThis floating rock became the new\nhome of our people. In time, it came\nto be known as {color[0000]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}.
Demo62_01:06	After a long and fierce battle, the\n{color[0003]}goddess{color[ffff]}, {color[0003]}Hylia{color[ffff]}, succeeded in sealing\naway Demise.\n\nHowever, soon after the demon king\nwas imprisoned, it became clear that\nthe seal would not hold long against\nhis fearsome power.\nHylia had suffered grave injuries in\nher battle with the demon king.\nShe knew that if he broke free again,\nthere would be no stopping him.
Demo62_01:07	And if the demon king were to free\nhimself, it would mean the {color[0000]}end of the\nworld {color[ffff]}for all beings of this land.\n\nIn order to put an end to the demon\nking, Hylia devised two separate plans\nand set them both into motion.
Demo62_01:08	First, she created {color[0003]}Fi{color[ffff]}. She made the\nspirit that resides in your sword to\nserve a single purpose: to assist her\n{color[0000]}chosen hero{color[ffff]} on his mission.\nHer second plan...{[0104|001e]}was to abandon her\ndivine form and transfer her soul to\nthe body of a mortal.
Demo62_01:09	...{[0104|000f]}She made this sacrifice, as you have\nlikely guessed, so that the {color[0000]}supreme\npower created by the old gods {color[ffff]}could\none day be used.\nFor while the {color[0000]}supreme power {color[ffff]}of the\n{color[0002]}Triforce {color[ffff]}was created by gods, all of its\npower can never be wielded by one.\n\nKnowing this power was her last and\nonly hope, the goddess gave up her\n{color[0000]}divine powers{color[ffff]} and her {color[0000]}immortal form{color[ffff]}.
Demo62_01:10	You've probably figured it out by now,\nhaven't you, {[0200]}?\n\n\n{[0106|ffcd]}You are the {color[0000]}chosen hero{color[ffff]},{[0104|0014]} and I, {color[0003]}Zelda{color[ffff]}...\n\n\n\n{[0106|ffcd]}I am the{color[0000]} goddess reborn as a mortal{color[ffff]}.
Demo62_01:11	The day of the ceremony, Ghirahim's\ntornado tossed me out of the sky and\ndown to the world below.\n\nI was nearly captured by the demonic\nforces, but I was rescued at the last\nmoment by the old woman who lives\nin the Sealed Grounds.
Demo62_01:12	I had no memory at all of my existence\nas Hylia, but she explained it to me.\nShe helped me to remember who I\nwas{[0106|fecd]}...{[0106|00cd]}and what I had to do.\nI set out to pray at the goddess statues\nlocated in each temple across the land.\n\n\nEach statue stirred up memories within\nme. After I visited them all, {color[0003]}Impa{color[ffff]},\nan {color[0000]}agent of the goddess{color[ffff]}, led me\nhere...to the past.
Demo62_01:13	{[0106|fdcd]}...{[0104|000f]}{[0106|ffcd]}All of this is part of the same great\neffort to prevent the revival of Demise.{[0104|0014]}
Demo62_01:14	Stripped of his true physical form by \nthe seal that binds him, he takes the \nshape of an abomination.\n\nBut even in his hideous state, he's more\nthan capable of devouring this land if \nwe allow him to do what he desires.
Demo62_01:15	We must stop him from freeing himself\nfrom the seal that imprisons him.\nAt any cost...\n\nThat is why I intend to remain here in \nthis time and place... To sustain the \nseal as best as I can.\n\nAs long as I continue this vigil, we may\nbe able to prevent the demon king from\nfully reviving himself in our own time. 
Demo62_01:16	I must maintain the seal that Hylia—{[0104|000f]}\nrather, that I—created so long ago and\nkeep it strong for as long as I am able.\n\nWith the memories of my former life\nreturning to me, I can see now that this\nis my purpose.
Demo62_01:17	{[0301]}{[0200]}, the goddess created\nFi and the great blade she's a part of\nfor very specific reasons.\n\nFor the task of standing against {color[0000]}Demise{color[ffff]}\nin the {color[0000]}monstrous form {color[ffff]}he now assumes\nrests solely on your shoulders.\n\nBack in our own time, you've already\ndriven him back into his prison twice\nnow. I can't thank you enough for\nthat, {[0200]}.
Demo62_01:18	During your long journey, you've\ngrown so much.\n\n\n{[0106|fecd]}You learned {color[0000]}wisdom {color[ffff]}from solving\ndevious puzzles and traps. {[0104|0014]}You gained\n{color[0000]}power{color[ffff]} by honing and tempering both\nyourself and your sword.\nAnd by overcoming the trials set\nbefore you by the goddess, you've\nfound true {color[0000]}courage{color[ffff]}.\n\n{[0106|00cd]}Now that those qualities reside in you,\nyou are worthy of wielding the power\nthe old gods left behind for our kind.\nYou can claim the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}.
Demo62_01:19	{color[0002]}Valiant {color[0000]}hero{color[0002]}, you have endured many\nhardships and journeyed far in your\nquest to reach this place.\n\n{color[0002]}Along your travels you have found\nwisdom, power, and courage, and for\nthis I shall bless your sword with the\ngoddess's power.{color[0002]}\n{color[0002]}May it give you and your sword the\nstrength to drive back the abomination\nthat threatens this land!{color[0002]}{color[ffff]}
Demo62_01:20	The mark you see upon the back of \nyour hand is proof that you are the \nhero of legend and that within you \ndwells sacred power.\nIt is the mark of the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n\nStand now, {[0200]}.\nDraw your sword.
Demo62_01:21	The goddess has blessed your blade, and\nthe Master Sword has at last achieved its\nultimate form!\n\nThe sword is now imbued with the mythical\npower to drive back demons, and only\n{color[0003]}{[0200]} {color[ffff]}may wield it!
Demo62_01:22	{[0301]}{[0200]}, before I say another\nword, I feel like I owe you an apology.\n\n\nYou see, the {color[0002]}mark of the Triforce {color[ffff]}on\nyour hand is a symbol of the greatest\npower in this world.
Demo62_01:31	If you can obtain the actual Triforce,\nwe will have the power to vanquish\nDemise once and for all.\n\nThe problem is, among the countless\nsouls in this world, only a select few—\nthose with an{color[0000]} unbreakable spirit{color[ffff]}—\ncan wield its might.
Demo62_01:23	It's impossible to know the true reason\nwhy the old gods created the Triforce.{[0104|000f]}\nBut I have a theory of my own.\n\nThe gods created the Triforce, yet they\nspecifically designed it so that their\nown kind could never use its power.\n\nSomehow, I think that may have been\ntheir way of giving hope to all the\nmortal beings of the land.\n\n...Which brings us back to {[0104|000f]}you.\n\n\n\nTo face Demise and give the land hope,\nthe goddess, Hylia, needed someone \nwith an unbreakable spirit. That\nsomeone is you, {[0200]}.
Demo62_01:24	But spirit alone wasn't enough.\n{[0104|001e]}You had to overcome many trials and\n{color[0000]}awaken the hero within yourself {color[ffff]}so that\nyou could {color[0000]}wield that supreme power{color[ffff]}.\nAnd so Hylia...{[0104|0014]} I mean, and so I...{[0104|002d]}\n\n\n\n{[0106|ffcd]}I knew that if it meant saving Zelda,\nyou would throw yourself headfirst\ninto any danger, without even a\nmoment's doubt...\n{[0106|ffcd]}I...{[0104|002d]} I used you.{[0106|00cd]}
Demo62_01:25	I can't begin to tell you how sorry I am\nfor pulling you into all of this,\n{[0200]}.\n\nBut you have to understand this is a\nwar, and the fate of the land hangs in\nthe balance. I need your strength to tip\nthe scales in our favor...
Demo62_01:26	All that may be well intentioned and\ntrue, but it doesn't mean it's right...\nand it doesn't excuse my actions.\n\nBut I'm prepared to pay the price for\nwhat I've done.
Demo62_01:27	To ensure that the seal holds, I will\nremain here in this time...deep in sleep\nfor thousands of years.
Demo62_01:28	{[0106|ffcd]}{[0301]}{[0200]}...I can't say it\nenough. I'm so sorry for the way I had\nto involve you in this.{[0104|0014]}\n\n{[0106|ffcd]}But until my memory of things before\nour lifetime returned to me, I had no\nidea we were fated to carry such a\nheavy destiny.\n{[0106|ffcd]}Before all this, I was happy just\nspending my days hanging around with\nyou in Skyloft. I wanted that feeling to\nlast {[0104|000f]}forever.{[0106|00cd]}
Demo62_01:29	While it's true that I am Hylia reborn,\nI'm still my father's daughter{[0104|000a]} and\nyour friend...\n\nI'm still your Zelda.
Demo62_01:30	When Demise is finally gone, there will\nbe no more need for the seal that binds\nhim, and then I'll be able to wake up.\n\nSo I'm going to ask you a favor,\nsleepyhead. Ever since we were kids,\nI'd always be the one to wake you up\nwhen you slept in.\nBut this time, when all of this is over,\nwill you come to wake me up?{[0104|001e]} \n{[0100|ffff]}I promise.{[0101|ffff]}I will.{[0102|ffff]}Of course!
Demo69_02:01	{[0112|0000000b]}Master {[0200]}, I have news.\nI have confirmed that the Isle of the\nGoddess, which was formerly a part of\n{color[0003]}Skyloft{color[ffff]}, has returned to the surface.
Demo69_02:02	Furthermore, I have detected the\nsuccessful eradication of {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]}.\nYour prayers to the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]} have\nbeen heard.
Demo69_02:03	In light of these factors, the seal Zelda\nmaintained through her agelong sleep\nis no longer necessary. My projections\nindicate she will wake momentarily.
Demo69_02:04	I advise you to make your way to the \nSealed Temple as soon as possible.
Demo70_02:01	{[0106|fecd]}Good morning...{[0200]}...{[0106|00cd]}{[0105|00780000]}
Demo70_03:01	This is all very touching, really, but I'm\nafraid I have to cut this emotional\nmoment short.
Demo70_03:02	It's best for everyone if you forget\nabout your friend. The little {color[0003]}goddess{color[ffff]} is\nmine now! 
Demo70_03:03	My master may have perished in this\nage, but in the past he lives yet!\nI'm taking the girl back through that\ngate to help me revive the {color[0003]}demon king{color[ffff]}!
Demo70_03:04	You've been so adorably dogged in your\nquest to get in my way, and as much as\nit has delighted me, I can no longer\ntolerate you nipping at my heels.
Demo70_03:05	{[0106|fecd]}...{[0301]}{[0200]}...
Demo70_03:08	{[0106|fecd]}...{[0104|001e]}{[0106|ffcd]}Stand down.{[0104|000f]} You're in my way{[0104|000f]}, and\nthe sight of your appalling hair makes\nmy gorge rise.{[0104|000f]}
Demo70_03:06	You've done a fine job of spoiling my\nplans to revive the demon king in this\nage, so I see no point in dawdling here.
Demo70_03:07	But the past...oh, the past... So full of\npossibilities. I shall resurrect him\nthere with the divine soul of this \ngolden-haired girl!
Demo70_03:09	...You know, boy, you've really pushed\nme too far. The moment I sweated and\nbled for is at hand.\n\nI don't even have the time to grind my\nheel into a worm like you. Not now.
Demo72_01:01	Hear me, my hordes! The spell is nearly\ncomplete!{[0104|000f]} The demon king returns!{[0104|000f]}\nUntil then, you WILL keep that whelp\nfrom interfering with my ritual.
Demo72_01:02	I don't care if the whole lot of you get\nlodged on the end of his blade. You will\nbuy me the time I need! Do not fear\nhim... Fear my wrath if you fail me!{[0105|005a0000]}
Demo73_01:01	You're far too quick, boy!
Demo73_01:02	I realize a simple child like you knows\nnothing of magic, but spells like this\ntake time and a steady hand! Can't you\nwait quietly like a good boy? HMM?\nYou petulant brat... You've pushed me\ntoo far. I've waited my whole existence\nfor this! This is my moment!
Demo73_01:04	You know what? Fine! If you're so \nintent on hurrying to your grave, I'll be\nhappy to show you the way!{[0105|005a0000]}
Demo73_01:05	This time there will be no heroic\nescape. I was a fool to toy with you and\nlet you walk away with your life before,\nbut I won't make that mistake again.
Demo73_01:06	{[0108|01cd]}That, I promise!{[0105|003c0000]}
Demo73_01:07	If only I'd put you in your place from\nthe very beginning. Show a human a\nlittle mercy and next thing you know,\nhe thinks himself your equal!\nGiven my station, I had to maintain\nsome semblance of dignity, so I let you\nrun with your life... Twice, even.\nSuch a guilty pleasure...\nBut instead of scurrying away like any\ncreature with a basic instinct to\nsurvive, you just kept coming back.\nAgain...and again...and again.
Demo73_01:08	I've let a mere boy make a fool of me\nfor the last time. You stand before a\ndemon...{[0104|001e]}or should I say, a {color[0000]}weapon\n{color[ffff]}without mercy!{[0104|005a]} 
Demo73_01:09	For you, boy, I've prepared a most\nappropriate and humiliating death.\nI even have a pet name for it—I call it\nthe {color[0000]}endless plunge{color[ffff]}!\nFirst, I will take my time bludgeoning\nyou, and when I grow bored of it, I will\n{color[0000]}drive you to the edge{color[ffff]} and deliver a last\nstrike to send you {color[0000]}falling to your doom{color[ffff]}!\nI'll delight in casting your body into\nthis pit and snuffing out the flame of\nyour life! Your broken body will serve\nas fine sustenance for the demon king!
Demo75_01:01	This... This is preposterous.\nDriven to my knees by a simple child\nof man. Laughable!\n\nNo matter how many times we clash,\nI can't prevail! You think I can't\ndefeat you? You think I can't win??\n\nBoy...what are you?
Demo75_01:04	Ah... But never mind that. Victory is\nstill mine to savor. While we fought,\nthe ritual I started continued...\n\nAt last, it's complete! The demon king\nshall devour the soul of the goddess and\nresurrect in his full glory!
Demo75_01:05	Don't you see? It's all over! You and\nyour kind have lost! This world and\neverything in it now belong to\ndarkness!{[0104|001e]} They belong to my master!
Demo75_02:01	{[0106|ffcd]}Welcome back to us,{[0104|001e]} {color[0003]}Master{color[ffff]}.{[0106|00cd]}
Demo75_02:02	{[0106|fecd]}...{[0104|001e]}{[0106|00cd]}So you are the chosen knight of\nthe {color[0003]}goddess{color[ffff]}.
Demo75_02:03	{[0106|ffcd]}Intriguing...{[0106|00cd]}
Demo75_02:04	The goddess lowered herself to a\nmortal existence to keep me\nimprisoned.\n\nHow pathetic. This bag of flesh pales\nin comparison to the magnificence of\nher previous form.
Demo75_02:05	{[0105|00500000]}{[0108|01cd]}Don't worry, {[0200]}!\nGroose has got this!
Demo75_02:06	{[0301]}{[0200]}, I... {[0104|000a]}I caught her!\nShe's OK!
Demo75_02:07	Hmm... So you and that other human\nwould stand before obliteration to aid\nthe goddess, would you?
Demo75_02:08	How curious... The humans I've known\nwere weak things. Hardly more than\ninsects, shivering under rocks and\nready to flee at a mere glimpse of me.
Demo75_02:09	When last I walked this world, they did\nlittle more than scream and cling to\ntheir goddess, mewling and praying...\nCounting on her to protect them.\nHow amusing to think those cowards\nbegot someone like you.
Demo75_02:10	You grow more fascinating by the\nsecond, human. I never imagined I'd\nmeet one of your kind who wished to\nstand against me in battle.
Demo75_02:11	Very well, then. I shall prepare a place\nfor us where we will not be bothered\nby distractions. If you still have the\ncourage to face me, seek me there.
Demo75_02:12	{[0301]}{[0200]}, it's all on you!\nOh, and listen up! Grannie had some\ninfo for you!
Demo75_02:13	The old girl says it'll take time for that\ngrease wad to absorb Zelda's soul\ncompletely!
Demo75_02:14	If you can take him down before her\nsoul gets all sucked up into that...\nthing, you might still have a chance!
Demo75_02:18	I...I know you can do it!
Demo75_02:15	So...yeah! You've gotta do this! \nYou're all Zelda's got! You've got to \nmake this happen!
Demo75_02:16	If you fear for your life, do not follow\nme.{[0104|000f]} You can spend what little time\nyour world has left cowering and\ncrying, as befits your kind.\nBut if you truly desire to raise your\nblade against the world I would build,\ncome for me.\n\nI've waited eons to return. I can spare a\nfew more moments to let you decide.
Demo75_02:17	{[0106|ffcd]}It's up to you now,{[0104|0014]} {[0200]}...
Demo75_04:01	Ah, so you've decided to meet your end\nin battle after all. It pleases me greatly\nto see such misplaced valor, human.
Demo75_04:02	Take a moment to appreciate your\nsurroundings, for where we stand\nshall serve as your tomb for eternity.
Demo75_04:03	{[0105|00460000]}The hate for the gods that has boiled\nin my veins...
Demo75_04:04	You will taste all of it in the bite of\nmy blade.
Demo75_04:05	The only question left is how long you\nwill manage to remain standing before\nI take your life.{[0104|001e]} Try to keep it \ninteresting for me, would you?
Demo75_04:06	And when you do fall, know that your\nworld and everything in it is mine to\ndominate... Mine to subjugate...\nMine to rule!
Demo75_04:07	When I finish with you, you can take\nsolace in knowing your friends and kin\nwill soon follow, as I wipe all who\noppose me from the face of this world!
Demo75_04:08	...It won't be long now. At last, the\nalmighty power I've sought for\nmillennia...
Demo75_04:09	I will take the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]} for my own...
Demo75_04:10	{[0105|003c0000]}And the world shall be under my foot\nfor eternity!
Demo76_01:01	{[0105|006f0000]}Extraordinary. You stand as a paragon\nof your kind, human.\n\n\n{[0105|006a0000]}You fight like no man or demon I have\never known. {[0104|0005]}Though this is not the end.\n\n\n{[0105|005b0000]}My hate...{[0104|0005]}never perishes. {[0104|0005]}It is born\nanew in a cycle with no end!\n\n\n{[0105|005b0000]}I will rise again!
Demo76_01:02	{[0105|00dc0000]}Those like you... Those who share the\nblood of the goddess and the spirit of\nthe hero... They are eternally bound to\nthis curse.\n{[0105|00dc0000]}An {color[0003]}incarnation {color[ffff]}of my hatred shall\never follow your kind, dooming them to\nwander a blood-soaked sea of darkness\nfor all time!
Demo76_01:03	{[0112|00000012]}I have confirmed the eradication of the\ndemon king.\n\n\n{[0104|001e]}His residual consciousness has been\nabsorbed into the {color[0005]}Master Sword{color[ffff]}...{[0104|001e]}{[0106|ffcd]}\nand is now {color[0000]}sealed away{color[ffff]}.
Demo77_01:01	You have done well, {[0200]}.
Demo77_01:02	{[0106|ffcd]}{[0104|000f]}{[0301]}{[0200]}...{[0104|001e]} Thank you.\nI think it's over...{[0104|000f]} Finally...it's all over.
Demo77_01:03	Nice going, you two. You guys were\ntotally amazing in this little adventure\nI like to call the {color[0000]}Legend of Groose{color[ffff]}.
Demo77_01:04	...That's a little joke.
Demo77_01:05	Joke or not, your contributions to our\nefforts were heroic. You have my\nthanks.
Demo77_01:06	Aww, well, you know... Just glad I could\nmake myself useful. I'm happy things \nturned out OK.
Demo77_01:07	Hey, so things look pretty sewn up\nhere. What do you say, guys? \nReady to head back to our own time?
Demo77_01:08	Grannie was really worried about you\ntwo. We don't want to keep the old girl\nin suspense too long.
Demo77_01:09	Hylia, Your Grace...{[0104|0014]} Or perhaps you\nprefer “Zelda." It pleases me to know\nyou are safe.\n\n{[0106|fecd]}...{[0104|000f]}{[0106|00cd]}Master, I must speak with you.
Demo77_01:10	{[0112|00000001]}Master {[0200]}, you have\nsuccessfully protected the goddess\nreborn and defeated Demise, fulfilling\nyour role as the {color[0000]}hero{color[ffff]} of legend.\nMy purpose here is complete.\n\n\n\nTherefore, I ask you to dissolve our\narrangement as master and servant.
Demo77_01:11	Drive the sword into the pedestal\nbefore you, and I will return to the\nsword to enter a sleep without end.
Demo77_01:12	{[0112|00000001]}Master, you have achieved the purpose\nyou were chosen to fulfill. Please, set\nthe sword in the pedestal and bring the\ngoddess's mission to an end.
Demo77_01:13	Now,{[0112|00000002]} Master. It is time to conclude our\nnecessary companionship.
Demo77_01:14	{[0301]}{[0200]}...
Demo77_01:15	{[0301]}{[0200]}, hear me.\nMy purpose was to obey the command\nof the goddess and lead you, the chosen\nhero of this land, on your quest.\nWhen I first awoke and began this task,\nI perceived it as merely serving my\nfunction as a servant to Her Grace.\n\nHowever, I have come to consider the\ninformation corresponding to our\ntime together among the most precious\ndata I have on record.
Demo77_01:16	I do not have the capability to fully\nunderstand the human spirit,\n{[0200]}...\n\nBut now, at the end of my journey with\nyou, as I prepare to sleep within the\nMaster Sword forever, I experience a\nfeeling I am unable to identify.\nI lack sufficient data to be sure of my\nconclusion, but I believe this feeling\ncorrelates closest to what your people\ncall...{[0104|001e]}happiness.
Demo77_01:17	Our partnership is at an end, and even\nas we speak, I feel my consciousness\nfading away.\n\nBefore I enter the sleep that calls me\nto the sword, I wish to relay to you\nwords that I recorded many times over\nthe course of our journey.\nMany have said them to you thus far,\nbut I now wish to say them for myself...
Demo77_01:18	{[0106|fdcd]}Thank you,{[0104|001e]} {[0112|00000011]}Master {[0200]}.{[0104|001e]}\nMay we meet again in another life...{[0104|001e]}
Demo77_01:19	What? Impa, why? Come with us!
Demo77_01:20	Zelda, Your Grace, you possess the\nmemories of the goddess. You must\nunderstand why that is not possible.\n\nI am a being of this age.\nMy place is here.
Demo77_01:21	{[0106|fecd]}I...{[0104|000f]} I know that, but...
Demo77_01:22	You must return to your own time.\nI will take care of the gate once you\nhave passed through.
Demo77_01:23	I...can't do that. You and I have been\nthrough so much together. I don't want\nto leave you alone.
Demo77_01:24	Please, Impa. Come back with us.
Demo77_01:25	Zelda, at the command of the goddess,\nI passed through the Gate of Time. \nI did so to protect you and aid the fight\nto prevent the world's destruction.\nThe last remnants of {color[0003]}Demise{color[ffff]} are \ndecaying slowly within the sword.\nSomeone must stay behind to watch\nover this blade.\nHis spirit must not reawaken.\nHe must never be allowed to threaten\nthe world again.
Demo77_01:27	This is the nature of the task given to\nmy tribe.\n\n\nAs a member of the {color[0003]}Sheikah{color[ffff]}, the\ngoddess's chosen guardians, I gladly\nwelcome this duty.
Demo77_01:28	Zelda, I shall watch over the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}.\n\n\n\n{color[0002]}{[0106|ffcd]}Its power is too great to leave in the\ngrasp of man. Dependence on its might\nis an invitation to disaster.\n\n{color[ffff]}{color[0002]}{[0106|ffcd]}When it has served its purpose, it must\nbe secreted away to lie dormant once\nagain...the knowledge of its existence\nhidden from mortal history.{color[0002]}{[0106|00cd]}{color[0002]}\n{color[ffff]}These are the words the goddess spoke\nto me long ago. I remember them well.\nAs do you, I'm sure.
Demo77_01:29	{[0106|ffcd]}Do not despair, Zelda. You and I will\nsurely meet again someday. 
Demo79_01:01	{[0106|fccd]}...See?{[0104|002d]} {[0106|fecd]}I told you we'd meet again.
Demo79_01:03	{[0106|ffcd]}Impa...{[0104|0014]} Thank you.\n\n\n\n{[0104|001e]}{[0106|fecd]}Thank you for everything.{[0106|00cd]}
Demo79_02:01	{[0106|ffcd]}Look around us! As a child, I always\ndreamed of a world below. I wanted to \nsee the surface with my own eyes{[0104|000f]} and\nfeel the land's warm breeze on my skin.{[0104|000f]}\n{[0106|ffcd]}I...{[0104|001e]} I think I want to live here. {[0104|0014]}\nI always want to feel solid ground \nbeneath my feet{[0104|000f]}, see the clouds above\nmy head,{[0106|00cd]} and watch over the {color[0002]}Triforce{color[ffff]}.
Demo79_02:02	{[0106|fecd]}What about you, {[0200]}?{[0104|001e]}\nWhat will you do now?
