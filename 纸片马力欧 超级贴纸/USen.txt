LH_T3_D	Do you think there's actually a chance\nof us reviving Sticker Fest?
LH_T3_E	Look at those Toads, giving it their all.\nWe've got to work just as hard!
LH_T3_F	Wow! Maybe we really CAN revive the\nfestival. C'mon, we've got to push it!
LH_T3_G	They're rehearsing for the Sticker Fest!\nThis is the home stretch!
LH_T4_A	Wow, what kind of place IS this? \nIt seems sort of...sketchy.
LH_T4_B	This operation looks pretty shady, but I \nhave to admit, the thing stickers are \npretty amazing.
LH_M1	Smell that salt air? The sea is nearby.
LH_M1_A	A lot of this stuff looks like junk.\nOf course, a lot of it looks like not junk.
LH_M1_B	I can't see anything, so I can't say \nanything. Sorry.
LH_M2	The waves are shiny just like me!\nSurfshine Harbor's the perfect name.
LH_M2_A	That thing is huge! No way is that \nthing normal.
LH_M2_B	This ship is paper, so I'm pretty\nimpressed that it doesn't, y'know, sink.
LH_W1_1	The Warm Fuzzy Plains sure do make\na sticker feel warm and fuzzy.
LH_W1_2_A	Ugh! The wind's too strong...\nIt's really messed this place up.
LH_W1_2_B	It seems wrong to call a place without \nlots of flowers "Bouquet Gardens."
LH_W1_2_C	Such a pretty green! This really looks\nlike a park.
LH_W1_2_D	The flowers smell so nice. So THAT'S\nwhy it's called Bouquet Gardens!
LH_W1_3	There's a lot of water here... Just as an\nFYI, water is paper's archenemy.
LH_W1_3_A	This one sticker was telling me that\nnegative ions in waterfall waters make\nskin feel fresh... Is that for real?
LH_W1_3_B	What's that strange thing up there?
LH_W1_3_C	It doesn't seem like just standing on \nthat thing does anything useful.
LH_W1_4	A windmill's called a windmill because it\nturns with wind. Words of wisdom!
LH_W1_4_A	Wow, it's pretty dim and cool in here...\nKind of a little scary. Just a little.
LH_W1_5	This is my first time mountain climbing!\nLook! I'm a mountain sticker!
LH_W1_5_A	Wow, all this in the clouds! How cool!
LH_W1_6	Pretty impressive fortress, huh?\nHow did GOOMBAS build this?
LH_W2_1	It's too hot! My glue's going to dry out.
LH_W2_1_A	Where's this desert supposed to be?\nThink it's on the other side?
LH_W2_1_B	It's relatively cool over here, but it's\ndefinitely hot on the other side of\nthese doors.
LH_W2_1_C	The sand is really flowing around here.\nBe careful!
LH_W2_1_D	So this is what it's like underground...\nLovely. Try not to get washed away by\nthe sand!
LH_W2_1_E	Cool! This is what you call a pyramid?
LH_W2_1_F	What could bore a tunnel like this\nthrough earth? Sand, I guess.
LH_W2_2	I feel like I'm being digested by an \nanimal or something. What part would\nthis be? The gizzard?
LH_W2_2_A	There's something really big over \nthere... Is that some kind of animal?
LH_W2_2_B	Now that I see it up close, it IS big.\nIt totally looks like a dinosaur.\nOr maybe a dragon.
LH_W2_2_C	Wow, we are WAY up high! Hey...\nI guess this is what it means to have\nyour nose in the air, huh?
LH_W2_3	This is a total maze. Make sure you\nremember which way we came, OK?
LH_W2_3_A	There's a staircase leading \nunderground. It must be the entrance\nto the ruins, don't you think?
LH_W2_4_A	We have to get through this sandstorm!\nSand is a sticker's worst nightmare!
LH_W2_4_B	Phew. That sandstorm was the worst.
LH_W2_4_C	Oasis? Where?
LH_W2_4_D	Wow, this is a resort. The pool looks so\nrefreshing! Even though we can't go in.
LH_W2_4_E	This cottage is AMAZING! I bet it's \nexpensive, staying in a place like this.
LH_W2_5	Sure is solid for such ancient \nconstruction. Hard to believe it's paper.
LH_W2_5_A	Nothing there. Weird...
LH_W2_5_B	I'm surprised a tower like this was even\nbuilt. I mean, look at this thing soar!
LH_W2_5_C	This must be the roof, but something's\noff here...
LH_W3_1	That stench is POISONOUS?\nIt stinks so bad, it MUST be!
LH_W3_1_X	This is the way the forest SHOULD look.\nQuiet, green, and fragrant.
LH_W3_1_A	There's no way I could ever sleep in \na place like this!
LH_W3_1_B	Yup, it's a forest. As forest as it gets.
LH_W3_2	We're not walking the right way?\nYou can't be serious. In case I haven't\ntold you, I hate getting lost.
LH_W3_3_A	That's a pretty big tree. You really\nwant to hike up that? Can't we use an\nelevator instead?
LH_W3_3_B	This definitely feels like a boy's room. \nThat said, it's pretty clean!
LH_W3_3_C	Living in a tree... That's so Wiggler.
LH_W3_4	Even the idea of a poison lake makes\nme feel ill. It makes me want to do\nsomething about that poison. Fast.
LH_W3_5	It would be relaxing to float downstream\non a leaf... You know, if the stream\nweren't POISON.
LH_W3_6	A hilltop with an ocean view sounds so\nromantic. If it weren't for this poison...
LH_W3_7	This is going to scar my psyche. I can\njust FEEL it! Don't let these things\nsnatch you!
LH_W3_7_A	A burrow? I have a REALLY bad feeling\nabout this...
LH_W3_8	Visibility is really poor here, so watch\nyour step.
LH_W3_9	Time to show off your jumping skills! \nIf you fall in, you're definitely getting\nan exfoliating poison bath.
LH_W3_10	Anytime we go on a quiz show,\nyou're on your own. I don't do trivia!
LH_W3_10_A	That's a big tree stump, huh?\nI bet there's something below it... 
LH_W3_11	All these holes make for some dangerous\nfooting... Of course, I float in the air, \nso I don't care. Good luck with that.
LH_W3_12	The beach! That sea breeze feels so \nnice! If it weren't for all this poison.
LH_W4_1_A	Snow! This is my first time seeing it!\nAmazing!
LH_W4_1_B	These hills are making me tired. \nSnow's pretty and all, but it's hard to \nwalk in. Or even float over.
LH_W4_1_C	Hey, shouldn't those weird sliding \nthings stop for crossing pedestrians?\nWhat a bunch of road hogs.
LH_W4_1_D	It feels tidier now that the snow drifts\nhave all melted away, right?
LH_W4_2	The river's frozen and slip-slidey!\nWhat's worse, those weird things are\nsliding all over the place again!
LH_W4_2_A	It's cold and dark. And slippery.\nCold, dark, and slippery. Careful.
LH_W4_2_B	Even the waterfall's frozen. Weird.\nIt's like time has stopped.
LH_W4_3	Mario, you aren't just a little afraid,\nare you?
LH_W4_3_A	What a fantastic mansion! And in such\na remote spot in the mountains.
LH_W4_3_B	What a huge lobby. Maybe this is some\ncelebrity's house. 
LH_W4_3_C	Ugh, it really smells moldy or something.\nAnd if paper gets moldy, it's all over.
LH_W4_3_D	Yeah, it's snowing outside, per usual.\nGet inside quick. It's too cold! 
LH_W4_3_E	When you take a good look at this\nhouse, you have to admit that it is\nREALLY nice.
LH_W4_4	When it's this cold, everything freezes.
LH_W4_5_A	We've come pretty high up... It's even\ncolder up here because of the altitude.
LH_W4_5_B	We're going to ride a chairlift? \nExciting!
LH_W4_5_C	Wow, look down! This is amazing!\nChairlifts are the best!
LH_W4_5_D	Whoa, this cave is dark! Although, are\nthere really any BRIGHT caves?
LH_W4_5_E	Wow, now we're back outside! \nThis chairlift is INCREDIBLE!
LH_W4_5_F	Huh? The chairlift ride is over? Boo.\nLet's go one more time!
LH_W4_6_A	Huh? What is this line? It must be for\nsomething exciting! Though I don't know\nhow they can top that chairlift!
LH_W4_6_B	Are we starting yet? Are we? Now? \nI am SO excited.
LH_W4_6_C	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! STOPPPPPPPPP!\nI'M TOO SCAAAAAAAAAAARED!
LH_W4_6_D	I... I... I don't feel so good...
LH_W4_6_E	We're riding that...thing again? \nI'll try not to scream.
LH_W5_1	Jungles are really hot and humid.\nFun fact: that's not good for paper.
LH_W5_1_A	Somebody dumped all this trash?\nWasting paper just enrages me.
LH_W5_2	I can't do anything for you. Sorry!\nGood luck on the rapids!
LH_W5_2_A	This jungle river sure flows fast, huh?\nNo wonder it's so loud.
LH_W5_2_B	Huh? A pipe. Definitely a pipe.\nAnd that means we're going in, right?
LH_W5_3	I can't do anything to help. Sorry!\nBe careful in this murk.
LH_W5_3_A	Oh no! I got wet from the splash zone\nof that waterfall. I HATE getting wet.
LH_W5_4	I can't believe there are ruins like these\nso deep in the jungle...
LH_W5_5	Ay-yay-yay! Talk about hot!
LH_W5_5_A	The water temperature seems nice,\nbut it looks like it'd take my glue off,\nso I'll be skipping a dip.
LH_W5_5_B	Frozen rock solid! Now that's what I \ncall cold!
LH_W5_6	You've never been eaten by a flower\nbefore? I have. It's the WORST.
LH_W5_6_A	We're going into the crater?! Neat!
LH_W5_6_B	Wow, we've really gotten deep. \nIt's the magma that's making it so hot,\nright? Stupid magma.
LH_W6_1	Hmm, you're right. No matter how hard\nyou stare at it, it seems like a regular\nold cliff wall.
LH_W6_1_A	Light from the Royal Stickers...\nWhat power DON'T they have?!
LH_W6_1_B	Paperization complete! Now, what's the\nmeaning of THAT?!
LH_W6_1_C	Bowser's castle is hiding around here\nsomewhere. It HAS to be.
LH_W6_2	That little brat has quite the toy\ncollection. Must be nice, being spoiled.
LH_W6_2_A	Since this ship is paper, it's light!\nSo it's not surprising it can fly.
LH_W6_3_A	An entrance made of your own face...\nBoy, this guy's got bad taste.
LH_W6_3_B	It feels like...the finale, doesn't it?\nTo be honest, I'm a little nervous.
LH_W6_3_C	One taste of those spikes below, \nand you're done for! Talk about a poor\ninterior-design decision!
LH_W6_3_D	Bowser's face is on the floor too? \nThis guy's got zero design sense.
LH_HIMITSU	Stick those door stickers up and they\nopen secret areas... Secret doors rule.

LA_W1_1_A	Let's go find those Royal Stickers!\nMove out!
LA_W1_1_B	That ripped-out bridge scrap is all the\nway up there! Do you think anyone can\nlend us a hand?
LA_W1_1_D	Let's take that torn-out bridge scrap\nback to where it originally belonged. \nI'll show you something good!
LA_W1_1_C	The bridge is fixed! Let's move on.
LA_W1_2_A	What a wind! I wonder where it's\nblowing from? 
LA_W1_3_A	We have to do something about that \nwater to get that comet piece...\nHave we been everywhere we can go?
LA_W1_4_A	It bothers me that I had never seen a\nsticker type like the one we used in\nthat fight on the Warm Fuzzy Plains.\x0e\0\x04\0Let's go ask around Decalburg.
LA_W1_4_B	If you see anything...strange, the first\nthing you should do is paperize. \nALWAYS a good idea.
LA_W1_4_C	I feel so bad for that poor, crying Toad.\nMaybe we can do something for him? 
LA_W1_4_D	That crybaby Toad got lost because he\nwas so deep in thought. I wonder what\nhe was thinking so deeply about? 
LA_W1_6_A	When you get stuck, paperize. \nSometimes the way forward will open!
LA_W2_2_A	If it's a sphinx, it's got to have at least\nONE treasure, right? Something flashy.\nIt's like a law or something.
LA_W2_3_A	These are ruins, right? So there's got to\nbe at least one treasure. Do you think\nit could be hidden in a coffin?
LA_W2_4_A	I was just thinking, maybe there was\nsomething useful stored in the\nwarehouses at Surfshine Harbor.
LA_W2_4_B	Paperization is REALLY important.\nOn the Sticker Star, we study it \nstarting in elementary school.
LA_W2_4_C	In life, one must remember to paperize\nfrequently. That's what my \ngrandsticker used to say!
LA_W2_5_A	Now that we've returned the oasis to\nits normal state, I wouldn't mind\ngetting a taste of that resort life.\x0e\0\x04\0That cottage looked pretty high end.\nI'd love to get a better look inside.
LA_W2_5_B	We haven't explored all around the \nDamp Oasis since that sandstorm \ndisappeared, have we?\x0e\0\x04\0It's probably pretty easy to miss \nsomething important in a sandstorm.
LA_W2_5_C	Did you understand what was written \non that slate in the Damp Oasis? \nI say we explore Drybake Desert.
LA_W2_5_D	Did we find everything at the Yoshi\nSphinx? I feel like I saw something\nflashing on the tip of its tongue.
LA_W2_5_E	I can't shake the feeling that we missed\na treasure or something important in an\narea we've already explored.
LA_W2_5_F	These murals may all LOOK the same,\nbut it seems like some of the ancient\nToads are in slightly different poses.
LA_W2_5_G	There might be another hint hidden in\nthese murals, so let's check them all\nreally thoroughly. 
LA_W2_5_H	The murals on this floor all have \ndifferent poses or face different \ndirections. Look verrrrrry closely.
LA_W3_1_A	That Goomba woke up the snoozing\nfortress Bob-ombs... Not a bad trick\nfor a Goomba.
LA_W3_1_B	Keep paperizing. Don't think. Just do it.\n\n...I love paperization. 
LA_W3_2_A	For the time being, we should probably\ngo check Wiggler's house for clues. \nWe HAVE to get through the Bafflewood.
LA_W3_3_A	First, let's find the first segment of\nWiggler's body.
LA_W3_3_B	Where could the second segment of \nWiggler's body be? 
LA_W3_3_C	We've got to catch the third segment of\nWiggler's body.
LA_W3_3_D	Let's find the fourth segment of \nWiggler's body. That's the last one! \nLet's do it!
LA_W3_3_E	Wiggler said he was waiting at \nWhitecap Beach, didn't he?
LA_W3_4	Wiggler's segment must still be around\nStrike Lake somewhere.
LA_M2_A	Looks like we've found all the Royal\nStickers around here.\x0e\0\x04\0The time has finally come for us to head\nto the continent across the sea! \nSurfshine Harbor is where we should be.
LA_W4_1_A	Nothing like some hot paperization on a\ncold day. Let's warm it up!
LA_W4_3_A	I sense that there are terrifying things\nsomewhere nearby.
LA_W4_3_B	I feel a faint breeze. I think there's a\ndraft coming in from somewhere.
LA_W4_6_A	Let me teach you a famous saying \nthat'll help you remember how crucial\nit is to paperize when you're at a loss...\nStucky? Paperization makes you lucky!
LA_W5_3_A	We've used paperization to open the\nway forward about a million times...\nJust saying. 
LA_W5_5_A	Careful of the lava! It descends with\nenough force to punch a hole in the\nground. That'll HURT if it hits you!
LA_W6_1_A	We've found five Royal Stickers already,\nbut where should we go next? There \nmust be a place we haven't solved...
LA_W6_1_B	Bowser's castle is up in the sky. \nDo we know anyone who can fly us up\nthere?
LM_01	Huh? What's that?\x0e\0\x04\0I have to tell you, I'm not familiar with\nthat...thing. It's so rare to see\nsomething that's not flat!\x0e\0\x04\0We'd better play it safe and keep this\nthing as a souvenir, at the very least. \nI can cram it in the album.
LM_02	Huh, another one of those things I'm\nnot familiar with...\x0e\0\x04\0This one looks really rare too. \nWell, let's take it. 
lucie_royal_angry	Uh, Mario, you're forgetting something \nREALLY important! You have to take \nthe Royal Sticker!

hrb_entrance_kino_00	Hi, Mario. If you like ships and\nwarehouses, you've come to the right\nport. Welcome to Surfshine Harbor!
hrb_captain_kino_00	Greetings. I am this ship's captain.\nYes, it is my job to pilot this craft upon\nthe briny deep, but...\x0e\0\x04\0Just look at it. My beautiful ship!\nIt's broken down and won't budge.\x0e\0\x04\0I am a CAPTAIN, not a mechanic!\nI haven't a clue what the problem could\nbe. Whatever should I do? 
hrb_captain_kino_01	My beautiful ship won't budge for \nreasons unknown. What should I do?
hrb_captain_kino_02	Ah, so there wasn't any wheel! \nI KNEW something didn't look right! \nNo wonder it wouldn't move!\x0e\0\x04\0Thank you! Good sir, you certainly are\na first-rate mechanic.\x0e\0\x04\0Now I can get back to being a glorious\nseafaring captain.\x0e\0\x04\0All aboard! Anchors aweigh! Full steam\nahead! Stow your tray tables!
hrb_captain_kino_03	Shall we shove off? \x0e\x03\0\x14\0\0\x01\0\0\0d\0\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0
hrb_captain_kino_04	Then we depart for the big blue!\nFull steam ahead!
hrb_captain_kino_05	I fully understand. I'll await you here.
hrb_captain_kino_06	Huh? That's quite strange, isn't it?\nWe're not going anywhere.\x0e\0\x04\0We just fixed this blasted ship!\nWhat is it now?!
hrb_captain_kino_07	What in the world?! Good heavens!\nWas that a rogue wave? It's clearly\ntoo unsafe to take this ship out now!
hrb_captain_kino_08	I've never seen such a mammoth\nCheep Cheep! Surely there can be no\nother name for this beast than the\nBig Cheep Cheep!
hrb_captain_kino_09	Such a monstrous Cheep Cheep rising\nforth from the depths... Truly, the sea\nis an unknowable font of frights...\x0e\0\x04\0Compared to that leviathan, my little\nexistence seems so...tiny.\x0e\0\x04\0I think I'll confine myself to dry land for\na time in order to take a long, hard\nlook at who I am. In other words...\x0e\0\x04\0I am stepping down, Mario!\x0e\0\x04\0Take the wheel, and use this ship as\nyou see fit. I appoint you captain!\x0e\0\x04\0All hail the new captain!
hrb_captain_kino_10	Aye, Captain! Take the helm, and go\nforth onto the deep blue!
hrb_sanbashi_kino_00	That ship normally sails for the\ncontinent across the sea, but it's not \nrunning today.
hrb_sanbashi_kino_01	ACK! That fish is called a Cheep Cheep,\nin case you were wondering about it. \nBut they're normally, like, smaller.\nI've never seen one that big. AAACK!
hrb_sanbashi_kino_02	Ah, Captain Mario. The ship's repaired,\nthe Cheep Cheep is no more, and now\nwe can finally set out to the continent\nacross the sea.
hrb_sanbashi_kino_03	Well, the ship's repaired, the Cheep \nCheep is no more, and now we can \nfinally set out to the continent across\nthe sea.
hrb_fisher_kino_00	Have you heard the tales of the\nmassive fishhook? The one so big it\ncan land a fish bigger than our tiny\nlittle minds can imagine?\x0e\0\x04\0Yeah, well, they say that hook exists\nand that it was loaded onto a fishing\nboat that left port the other day.\x0e\0\x04\0I've gotta say... That hook sounds BIG.
hrb_fisher_kino_01	Just once I'd like to use a big fishhook\nto land me a giant fish. Just once!\nIt's not a lot to ask!\x0e\0\x04\0Ah, if only I had a hook, or even a hook\nSTICKER, for crying out loud, I could\nbring in that fish!\x0e\0\x04\0When is that fishing boat carrying that\nhuge hook going to get back here?
hrb_fisher_kino_02	Oh my GOSH, it's Mario the Master!\nI mean, landing a huge fish like that?\nYou HAVE to let me call you the Master!
hrb_world_kino_00	Hear me, traveler: the world is vast.\x0e\0\x04\0On snow-covered peaks and fiery\nvolcanoes, adventure surely awaits!
hrb_world_kino_01	This world consistently blows my mind! \nTo think that a giant fish like that \nexists! Incredible!\x0e\0\x04\0I wonder if that fishing boat that was\nheaded toward the forest is all right...
hrb_world_kino_02	Hear these words, Captain Mario: \nthe world is vast!\x0e\0\x04\0Across the sea, on a continent where\na scant few have trod, further \nadventure surely awaits!
hrb_town_kino_00	It might surprise you, but rumors from\nDecalburg make their way out to this\nport pretty quick. For example, check\nout this grim tale.\x0e\0\x04\0In the town square, if you listen closely\nby the fountain, you might hear a\ncreeeeepy voice...\x0e\0\x04\0{s[075]}{d}...help me...{/d}\x0e\0\x04\0{s[100]}Have you heard it? Frankly, I bet it's\njust the sound of the fountain's water. \nDecalburg folks are known to be just a\ntouch timid. 
hrb_town_kino_01	Apparently the voice coming from the \nfountain in Decalburg has stopped.\x0e\0\x04\0I KNEW I shouldn't believe stories like\nthat! One of these days, I'm going to\nfreak myself RIGHT OUT.
hrb_soko_kino_01	These warehouses store rare items that\nhave been imported from overseas.\x0e\0\x04\0Anything that's not in a crate is \nbasically junk, so help yourself.
hrb_ne_kino_01	Yaaaaaawn... Huh? Mario?\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, hey! Yeah, I was looking for\nsomething when the lights went out. \nBoom! Pitch black. And then boom!\nFast asleep.\x0e\0\x04\0Sorry to block your way. I have a habit\nof sleeping really, really hard when the\nlights go out... Honest to goodness!
hrb_ne_kino_02	Sleeping high up felt really goooood.\x0e\0\x04\0But thanks to that nap, I've completely \nforgotten what I was looking for.
hrb_hanajoin_captain	Are you mad?! I'm not putting this ship\ninto harm's way!
hrb_hanajoin_souko	I'm sorry, but please refrain from\nbringing children into the warehouse.
hrb_lock_captain	I'm a bit busy inspecting the engines at\nthe moment.
hrb_mech_kino_00	This ship is currently undergoing an\nengine-maintenance inspection. Sorry.
hrb_mech_kino_01	That gentleman in blue over there is the\ncaptain of the ship he's standing next\nto, in case you were wondering.
hrb_mech_kino_02	By the by, I hired some guy part-time\nto go to the warehouse to look for spare\nparts for the ship. It's always good to \nhave spare parts just in case.
hrb_mech_kino_03	By the by, I hired some guy part-time\nto go to the warehouse to look for spare\nparts for the ship.\x0e\0\x04\0Yeah, NO idea what happened to that\nguy. He definitely didn't come back.\nNo way am I paying that deadbeat.
hrb_mech_kino_04	This is the biggest thing to ever happen\nat the harbor! THE BIGGEST, I SAY!
hana_take_ship_01	This is a fine mess!
hana_take_ship_02	What's wrong, little guy? Calm down.
hana_take_ship_03	I understand this fellow wants to get to\na small island off the forest coast by\nany means possible, but...\x0e\0\x04\0I must tell you, a fishing ship \ndisappeared from around there only \nrecently.\x0e\0\x04\0In other words...DANGER! Big danger!\nI'm not taking this ship near any kind\nof danger!
hana_take_ship_04	Did you hear that, little guy? \nHe's not taking the ship out.\x0e\0\x04\0I understand you want to do something\nabout the poison, but we'll have to give\nup the idea of going by ship.

SL_DODEKA_MEE_HAMMER_KK_M0	A hammer attack with good power that\nalso puts foes to bed. If you mess up the\ntiming, though, that's baaaaaaaad.
SL_BURNING_HAMMER_M0	A hammer whose tepid flames can fry\nsmall fry. If your timing's off, though,\nyou won't produce any flames.
SL_DEKA_BURNING_HAMMER_K_M0	A hot, flaming hammer attack that's \nnonetheless ineffective against the \nBuzzy Beetle family.
SL_DODEKA_BURNING_HAMMER_KK_M0	A flaming hammer attack that damages\nall foes that it strikes equally. We just \nwant to see you succeed, y'know?
SL_SEVERE_HAMMER_M0	A hammer that, if timed well, sends a\nfreezing arctic blast howling into the\nfaces of all enemies.
SL_DEKA_SEVERE_HAMMER_K_M0	A hammer attack that cold haters\nhate, but cold lovers love not hating.\nYou know what I mean?
SL_DODEKA_SEVERE_HAMMER_KK_M0	An attack that launches a really nasty\ncold wave boasting megaflash damage.\nMiss, and you hit zip.
SL_TOGE_HAT_M0	An attack that provides a spiky surprise\nfor attackers from above when you\ncrouch and hold it over your head.
SL_TOGE_HAT_K_M0	A stronger spiked-helmet attack, this\none hurts even more if you time your\npoke with the foe's landing.
SL_TOGE_HAT_KK_M0	A flashy spike attack that counters\nattacks from above with authority.\nTime it right, and OW!
SL_DEKA_BOOTS_M0	Attack-dodging boots. If you use them,\nthe attack power of any subsequent\njump-type stickers will go up.
SL_DEKA_BOOTS_K_M0	A defensive sticker that hugely boosts\nthe attack power of subsequent jump \nstickers. Definitely stick this one first!
SL_DEKA_TAIL_M0	A tail that repels attacks that come\nflying right at you. You've got to swing\nthat tail with good timing, though!
SL_DEKA_TAIL_K_M0	A shiny tail that smacks onrushing\nenemies and straight-flying projectiles.\nWhen you connect, it feels gooood.
SL_DEKA_FROG_M0	A froggy dodge maneuver that ups the\nattack power on subsequent stickers,\ntoo. Not bad for a frog.
SL_DEKA_FROG_K_M0	A shiny, froggy dodge that drastically\nboosts the attack power of subsequent\nstickers. Well done, frog.
SL_FIRE_FLOWER_M0	An attack that launches one fireball per\nenemy but doesn't reach flying foes.\nFireballs can't bounce that high.
SL_FIRE_FLOWER_K_M0	An attack that fires one shiny fireball\nper foe. Like others, this attack is a bit\nstronger if timed well.
SL_FIRE_FLOWER_KK_M0	An attack that greets each grounded\nand low-altitude foe with a strong,\nmade-to-order fireball. 
SL_ICE_FLOWER_M0	A chilly attack that serves an ice ball\nto each nonflying enemy. These ice\nballs are the opposite of refreshing.
SL_ICE_FLOWER_K_M0	A stronger ice-ball attack that strikes\nground-bound and low-altitude foes\nwith shiny chill damage.
SL_ICE_FLOWER_KK_M0	A flashy ice-ball attack that boasts\nboosted wintry power if you time your\nthrows correctly.
SL_POW_BLOCK_M0	An attack that can crumple grounded\nfoes. You get two chances at it, \nso time it well.
SL_POW_BLOCK_K_M0	An attack that offers higher damage\nand an elevated crumple rate if you\ntime it well.
SL_POW_BLOCK_KK_M0	A two-shot crumpler. As expected, \nits attack power is also higher due to\nextreme flashiness.
SL_NOKONOKO_KOURA_M0	A shell that knocks around foes when\nstomped and kicked. Time it well for \nmore power.
SL_NOKONOKO_KOURA_K_M0	A powerful shell that should remind you\nto pre-stomp Koopas in the field. Then\nyou can use them to scatter other foes.
SL_NOKONOKO_KOURA_KK_M0	A flashy shell that delivers big damage.\nThe damage on this attack nearly \ndoubles with good timing.
SL_KINOKO_M0	An all-important HP-restoring sticker\nthat can only be used during battle. \nAlways, ALWAYS carry one with you!
SL_KINOKO_K_M0	An item that increases HP more than a\nregular mushroom. Wait until you're\nreally flagging to use it!
SL_KINOKO_KK_M0	A flashy mushroom that greatly restores\nHP with flashy mushroom goodness.\nYou get bonus HP for good timing.
SL_DEKA_1UP_KINOKO_M0	A sticker that should teach you that\nbig mushrooms are great for you. This\none slowly restores HP over ten turns.
SL_DEKA_1UP_KINOKO_K_M0	A shiny HP restorer effective over ten\nturns. Time it with Mario's hands in the\nair for extra restorative power!
SL_POISON_KINOKO_M0	Oh no! An item that poisons you! \nBut hang on... What if you touch an\nenemy while poisoned...
SL_LEAF_M0	A helpful sticker that automatically\nmakes every attack Excellent and\nevery block successful.
SL_LEAF_K_M0	A sticker with the exact same effects of\nan ordinary leaf sticker. But look!\nIt's shiny! So it sells for more.
SL_DOOR_M0	A door that opens the way to a secret \nplace. This sticker can also be used to\nflee a battle.
SL_SNOW_BALL_M0	An icy snowball yacked up by a Snow\nSpike that hits all grounded foes with\na cold-blooded attack.
SL_GABON_BALL_M0	A spiky steel ball horked up by a Spike.\nThis bad boy deals bonus damage for\na well-timed throw!
SL_BARREL_M0	A wooden barrel thrown by a Broozer.\nThis thing is heavy, so be careful when\ntossing it.
SL_SPANNER_M0	A repair wrench tossed by Rocky \nWrenches. Time your toss well, because\nit'll affect the power of the spin!
SL_BONE_M0	Part of a Dry Bones? Some kind of bone,\nanyway. It hits with a satisfying DONK\nif thrown with enough force.
SL_BOOMERANG_M0	A boomerang beloved by the Boomerang\nBros. Put your elbow into it to get some\nforce into your throw!
SL_BOMB_M0	An unused bomb dropped by a Bob-omb. \nThis explosive has a dramatic effect if\ntossed properly.
SL_SOMBRERO_M0	A sombrero worn by Sombrero Guys. \nThe angle of the throw affects how cool\nthe attack turns out!
SL_THROW_KNIFE_M0	A throwing star favored by Ninjis. \nIt's easy to time this attack if you\nconcentrate.
MUSEUM_SL_JAPANESE_SCISSORS	When compressed by a team of Toads,\nthis catapult is capable of low-orbit\nlaunches. As the bladed end is lethal, \nthis was likely a discarded prototype.
MUSEUM_SL_HAIRCUT_SCISSORS	Like other bladed things, this requires a\ncommand Toad in each circular cockpit. \nHowever, the protruding flange suggests\na third operator is required for steering.
MUSEUM_SL_SCISSORS	When maneuvered by two skilled thing\ncaptains, this device cleaves anything.\nThis discovery will surely revolutionize\nthe Toad construction business.
MUSEUM_SL_CLOTH_SCISSORS	This massive, linked pair of sharpened\nblades was likely used for landscaping. \nTrained Toads can operate in tandem\nfrom the two oval command cockpits.
MUSEUM_SL_BELLOWS	Requiring an entire platoon of Toads to\noperate, this primitive pinwheel\nmotivator is a monument to inefficiency.
MUSEUM_SL_PAPER_FAN	Though its gigantic size limits its use to\nonly the largest of griddles, this ornate\nspatula is a sight to behold. The symbol\nis thought to mean "succulent pancake."
MUSEUM_SL_FAN	While voice modulators are not unheard\nof, this device is clearly the first built\nfor crowd use. It was likely used for\nintimidation at sporting events.
MUSEUM_SL_HANDY_CLEANER	The smallest of what is believed to be\na previously undiscovered type of\nsuction robot, this variation is highly\nmaneuverable and easily satiated.
MUSEUM_SL_UPLIGHT_CLEANER	A member of the Suction Thing family,\nthis variation waits for prey in an\nupright position, disguising itself as a\npart of the canopy. Then it strikes.
MUSEUM_SL_CLEANER	This mechanical thing appears to exist\nfor one purpose: to consume anything\nwithin reach. While not necessarily\nalive, it is most certainly hungry.
MUSEUM_SL_WATERING_CAN	This piece of demolition equipment is\nonly operable by highly trained Toads.\nOnce filled, targeted water sprinkles\ncan destabilize any paper edifice.
MUSEUM_SL_TAP	This hydroelectric-dam release valve\nmay once have functioned well, but\nthose days are long past. It now\nrequires a leaping Toad to activate it.
MUSEUM_SL_KETTLE	This ancient house alarm was designed\nfor icy climates. Placed by the furnace,\nits contents would boil when burglars\nturned the heat on, activating a siren.
MUSEUM_SL_TRUMPET	This valve-based alarm system requires\nthe operator to exhale as hard as\npossible into the apparatus. The result\nis a din trespassers won't soon forget.
MUSEUM_SL_VIOLIN	This audio-warfare thing requires a \nsquad of Toads to operate--one each to\nman the taut vibration hawsers and a\npair to manipulate the friction saw.
MUSEUM_SL_GUITAR	A fairly sophisticated audio weapon,\nthis thing utilizes electricity to\nminimize Toadpower. A single Toad can\nlaunch blistering assault "solos."
MUSEUM_SL_NEWSPAPER_BAT	A testament to the quiet strength of\npaper power, this triumphant rolled \ntube of separate sheets symbolizes how\nunity can bring forth might.
MUSEUM_SL_PLASTIC_BAT	While the width of this cylinder makes\nswinging at targets a breeze, its\naccuracy is bought with a loud bonking\nnoise sure to anger the neighbors.
MUSEUM_SL_BAT	This piece of wood has the power to\nsend round objects flying when swung\ncorrectly. The individual responsible for\nvandalizing it has yet to be identified.
MUSEUM_SL_ITTOKAN	This metal container could have been\nused for anything, but leading scholars\nbelieve it was almost certainly slept on\nby a cat at some point.
MUSEUM_SL_TUB	Plated in what is almost certainly gold,\nthis private, solar-powered hot tub was\nlikely overpaid for by a rich Toad who\nforgot that he was made of paper.
MUSEUM_SL_DRUMKAN	A debate rages about the contents of \nthis huge canister, but since breaching\nthe hull could ruin whatever's within,\nit stays sealed. Also, we can't open it. 
MUSEUM_SL_LAMP	This large bulb was engineered to house\nand protect a glowing filament, but a\nmajor design flaw allows all the precious\nlight to escape into the surroundings.
MUSEUM_SL_FLASHLIGHT	This compact lighthouse is designed to\nbe mobile, but the fact that it points\nstraight up when installed would lead\nto many a naval disaster.
MUSEUM_SL_SEARCHLIGHT	Our most learned academics remain\nstumped as to why anyone would install\nblinds on such a massive light source.\nIt kind of defeats the purpose.
MUSEUM_SL_BATTERY_BUTTON	This adorable little power source should\nnot, under any circumstances, be\ningested, no matter how hungry you are\nand how much it looks like candy.
MUSEUM_SL_BATTERY_1	All readings indicate that this cylinder\nharbors a huge amount of latent power.\nWe have attempted to access it, but a\nvigorous stick-poking met with failure.
MUSEUM_SL_BATTERY_CAR	Inside this device sleeps a power no\nToad could hope to control. In fact,\nyou'd probably better step back a bit.\nMaybe a little farther.
MUSEUM_SL_BILLIARD_BALL	This orb would be indistinguishable from\nother massive spheres if not for the \ninexplicable number on its side. For the\nlove of Toad, what does it MEAN?!
MUSEUM_SL_CURLING_STONE	It seems increasingly possible that this\nboulder spontaneously grew a handle\nout of its side. The wonders of nature\nare endless and often really weird.
MUSEUM_SL_BOWLING	Whether this orb was designed for\nbattle or merely construction, one thing\nis clear: the engineers who piloted it\nfrom the three Toad holes were brave.
MUSEUM_SL_TROPHY	This extravagant chalice looks pricey,\nbut functionally, it's a disaster. It's too\nbig for one Toad to drink out of, and \nwhat's that weird guy doing on top?
MUSEUM_SL_MOBILE_PHONE	For a device that appears to have but\na single purpose--violent vibration--\nthis thing has far too many buttons.
MUSEUM_SL_JACKHAMMER	What began as a training apparatus for\nan aspiring pogo-stick champion clearly\nspiraled out of control during the \ndevelopment phase.
MUSEUM_SL_OIL_HEATER	While most Toad breakfast scientists\nagree that this gargantuan machine\nis a toaster, none have had success\nwith the bread-insertion procedure.
MUSEUM_SL_DRYER	This large-scale rewarmer was likely\nutilized by primitive caterers, though\nit proved rather ineffective in both our\nquiche and chili-dog tests.
MUSEUM_SL_OVEN	For a supposedly high-end home feature,\nthis sauna is sorely lacking in seating,\nfancy perfumed steam waters and, most\nimportantly, a temperature control.
MUSEUM_SL_MAGNIFYING_GLASS	A leading Toad physicist burned\nbasically everything in the lab before\ndiscovering that this thing worked as\na magnification device.
MUSEUM_SL_MATCH	Under no circumstances should these\nsticks be rubbed against their own\npackaging. You just need to trust\nthe management on this one.
MUSEUM_SL_LIGHTER	This portable campfire works best when\nentrenched in cool earth. Deployment of\ns'mores is up to the camper, but have \nyou ever tried adding peanut butter?
MUSEUM_SL_SHAVED_ICE	Some frozen mountains can only be\nscaled by the burliest of Toad explorers.\nOthers can be scaled by any Toad with\na spoon and a lust for refreshment.
MUSEUM_SL_AIR_CONDITIONER	While researchers claim that this device\nhas a cooling effect, skeptics abound.\nIf anything, toting this thing around\nwould probably make you look uncool.
MUSEUM_SL_FRIDGE	Once thought to be a transportation\npod for northern Toads, this thing has\nsince proven to be a very effective \nstorage unit for management's lunch.
MUSEUM_SL_JUICE	Apparently, whatever mad scientist\ncreated this thing thought it would be\nfunny to load liquid into a highly\npressurized container. Ha ha.
MUSEUM_SL_WATER_PISTOL	In its current state, this liquid launcher\nis but a memory of wars long past.\nBut load it with water, and it becomes\nmore terrifying than you can imagine.
MUSEUM_SL_DUCK	There's been some speculation that this\nenormous synthetic duck suggests a\npast when Toads rode on birds, but\nthis theory has been roundly ridiculed.
MUSEUM_SL_POWDER_PUFF	Luxurious, if a bit dusty, this lush body\npillow was likely reclined upon by\nroyalty. It even SMELLS like royalty.
MUSEUM_SL_SPONGE	The bed of choice for Toads afflicted\nwith night sweats, this revolutionary\nmattress is as comfortable as it is\nabsorbent. Treat yourself today!
MUSEUM_SL_CAR_WASH_SPONGE	This liquid transporter can carry an\nabsolutely unbelievable amount of\nwhatever beverage you prefer, but be\nwarned: it gets HEAVY and MESSY.
MUSEUM_SL_PILLOW	This piece of emergency-response\nequipment helps fire brigades rescue\npeople from high buildings. It's also\ncrucial for battling nap attacks.
MUSEUM_SL_BED	While this thing resembles a common\nbed, it makes the typical paper bed of\nmanagement's childhood look like a \ncrumpled-up piece of used paper towel.
MUSEUM_SL_CANOPY_BED	This thing cannot be a bed. It has some\nbed-like characteristics, but there's no\nway--it's too nice. If you slept in that, \nyou'd dream of that exact same bed.
MUSEUM_SL_CELLOPHANE_TAPE	A variation of this thing has long been\nused by Toad security forces to restrain\nne'er-do-wells. It should not be used on\nyour little brother. I MEAN IT!
MUSEUM_SL_THUMBTACK	It's not uncommon for the younger \ngeneration of Toads to get paper\npiercings, but in general, they don't use\nsomething that affixes them to a wall.
MUSEUM_SL_STAPLER	This antiaircraft battery launches \ntwin-pronged missiles when propped \nopen but mangles the ordnance when \nfired in the prone position.
MUSEUM_SL_FOOK	We know what this thing is: a hook.\nWhat we don't know is what terrors of\nthe deep inspired a fisherman to make\nsomething so huge. And what of bait?
MUSEUM_SL_BALLOON	Friction tests conducted on this\nflotation transport resulted in one of\nthe worst Toad pile-ups in memory.\nEvery scientist was stuck to this thing.
MUSEUM_SL_POCKET_WATCH	While this thing can theoretically\nmanipulate time, every effort to use it\nto go back and avert that unfortunate \nchowder incident has failed.
MUSEUM_SL_MANEKINEKO	It's not uncommon to see a cat offering\nup a high-five--hence this sculpture.\nWe believe the symbol may mean\n"Down low! You're too slow."
MUSEUM_SL_HIGHHEEL	This single-Toad sleeping chamber offers\nthe snug fit and steep reclining angle\npopularized by certain celebrities.\nTrust us, it's really not comfortable.
MUSEUM_SL_GOAT	This statue of a voracious goat seems\ncute at first but becomes unsettling. \nWe're pretty sure it moved this one \ntime. And we swear we heard a baa.
MUSEUM_SL_TURKEY	This giant prehistoric bird was prepared\nfor a feast. That much is quite clear.\nBut was it brined? What kind of rub?\nCritical questions remain unanswered.
MUSEUM_SL_CAKE	A dessert of such magnitude comes\naround once in a long while, which is\nwhy this one is under surveillance.\nStep away from the display, sir.
MUSEUM_SL_BOOM_BOX	This portable party machine requires\ntwo Toads to transport, but it's well \nworth the effort if one wishes to rock\nanytime and anywhere.

museum_chief_kino_01	So yeah, I wanted to get the town back\nto normal more than anything...\x0e\0\x04\0And the reason is behind this door.\nCome on with me.

Hoo DILLY!

museum_chief_kino_04	Right! Well, about that... I can't say as\nI have many stickers yet. Well, any.
museum_chief_kino_05	But Mario, you look like a fella that's\ninto stickers, right? I mean, you just\nseem like you GET it. You're one of us.
museum_chief_kino_06	Well, not compared to some, but he\nknows his stuff.

step_kino_A_01	I just love these Warm Fuzzy Plains.\nThe sun always shines here!
step_kino_A_02	I defy you to find a day where the sun\nDOESN'T shine on Warm Fuzzy Plains!
step_kino_A_03	Warm Fuzzy Plains: the sunshiniest\nplace there is! I should write brochures!\nWhen I'm not PAAAANICKING!
step_kino_A_04	A lot of crazy stuff went down around\nhere...but nothing can keep this place\nfrom being the Warm Fuzzy Plains!
step_kino_B_01	Sure are a lot of Goombas loitering\naround here. If you see any, introduce\nthem to your shoes.
step_kino_B_02	Man, there are tons of Goombas\nwandering around here! If I were you,\nI'd treat them to a solid stomping.
step_kino_B_03	So many Goombas on patrol here!\nI'm being careful not to stomp them!
step_kino_B_04	There are STILL Goombas walking\naround like they own the place.\nIf you see any, give 'em a stomp for me!
step_kino_C_01	{d}Signs say{/d}\n{d}useful{/d}\n{d}stuff.{/d}\x0e\0\x04\0...That's a famous Toad saying!
step_kino_C_02	{d}Signs are{/d}\n{d}a rich source{/d}\n{d}of info.{/d}\x0e\0\x04\0...That's a famous Toad saying!
step_kino_C_03	Watch out for Bowser Jr.!\nI'd better write that on a sign QUICK!
step_kino_C_04	{d}A stack of{/d}\n{d}Toads can{/d}\n{d}do anything!{/d}\x0e\0\x04\0...That's a new Toad saying!
step_kino_D_01	Me and my buddies met here for a \ngood, old-fashioned sticker hunt, but\none of them seems to have taken off...\x0e\0\x04\0I bet he wants all the shiny ones for\nhimself. That cad!
step_kino_D_02	Me and my buddies met here for a \ngood, old-fashioned sticker hunt...\x0e\0\x04\0But my one buddy went off on his own.\nI bet he grabbed all the shiny ones for\nhimself. That weasel!
step_kino_D_03	A Bowser Jr. sighting! Oh, NOT COOL!\nThis is no place for sticker hunting!
step_kino_D_04	Phew! With Bowser Jr. gone, I can keep\nhunting stickers with my friends.
ore_kino_01	Whoa, Mario! No offense, but this is no\nplace to stop and chat!
ore_kino_02	Ah, Mario! Since you're here, that must\nmean you pummeled Bowser Jr.!\x0e\0\x04\0I still can't believe that twerp showed\nup just when I'd found a rare, never-\nbefore-seen-at-least-by-me sticker...\x0e\0\x04\0...What? The bridge is completely gone?\nThat's not good! We have to fix it!\x0e\0\x04\0Well, we're just a bunch of flat Toads,\nbut we've gotta do SOMETHING. \nLet's head over there!\x0e\0\x04\0{d}C'MON, FELLAS!{/d}
ore_kino_03	Y'know, that never-before-seen-at-\nleast-by-me sticker must be really rare.\x0e\0\x04\0I wonder if another sticker like that will\never fall again. I bet it'd sell for some\nserious coin.
kino_unired_01	What? You're going already, Mario?\x0e\0\x04\0Look, we'll wait here. Come back again\nwhen you've done your business, OK?
kino_unired_02	Way to keep a Toad waiting, Mario.\nC'mon, let's go!
kino_unired_03	Ah, gotcha. That wad up there?
kino_unired_03_01	All right, you guys! Time to Toad up!\nHearts and minds as one!\x0e\0\x04\0{d}Everyone...\x0e\x04\x04\x04\xfa\0\0\0STRETTTTTCH!{/d}
kino_unired_03_02	{d}Boom! There you go!{/d}
kino_unired_04	That went well. Glad we could help!
kino_unired_05	When we're stacked, we're unstoppable!\x0e\0\x04\0Well, see ya!
scissor_seal_m01_01	{d}{s[150]}HELP!{s[100]}{/d}
scissor_seal_m01_02_0	Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow...
scissor_seal_m01_02_1	Whoa, Mario! You gotta get up, man!\nThis is no place to be KO'd!
scissor_seal_m01_02_2	Listen, that crazy little monster is\nafter me, so I can't chat! He's all you!
scissor_seal_m01_06	Well, he seemed completely frazzled. \nI wonder what got him so worked up?
scissors_full_01	Oh no! You've got too many stickers, \nso you can't pick up this one.\x0e\0\x04\0No way can you leave that lying there.\nSeriously, LOOK at it! Let's clear some \nspace so you can pick it up.
scissor_seal_m02_01	Hmm? Well now, what's this? \nLooks like an incredibly rare sticker.\x0e\0\x04\0I know everything there is to know\nabout stickers, but this is the first time\nI've ever seen one of this variety.\x0e\0\x04\0Poor sticker... Left here all on its own.\nWe'd better pick it up. It's the right\nthing to do!
scissor_seal_m02_02	{d}DON'T RUN! WAIT UP!{/d}
scissor_seal_m02_03	Hey, you're Mario! Talk about weird.\nWhat are you doing here?
scissor_seal_m02_04	Sniff snoof snifffffffffffffff... Hold up.\nThat smell. THAT GLORIOUS STINK.\nHave you got a rare sticker?\x0e\0\x04\0News flash: all rare stickers are MINE.\nFork it over!
scissor_seal_b00_01	Well! Guess I'll just have to take that\nrare sticker by overpowering you,\nthank you very much.
scissor_seal_b01_01	Ha ha ha! Am I a beast or what?\nNo way are you gonna win.\x0e\0\x04\0But just 'cause you're on the brink of\na humiliating defeat, don't get all \ndesperate and think of using that \nrare sticker.\x0e\0\x04\0No no no NO! I want that sticker\npristine when I take it from you!
scissor_seal_b04_05	Hey, y'know, you're not too shabby...\nLuckily, at times like this, I just use the\npower my pop gave me to...RECOVERRR!
scissor_seal_m03_01	What?! C'mon, seriously? That sticker\nis overpowered! You cheat!
scissor_seal_m03_02	OK, look, I've had it! If that's the way\nit's gonna be, I've got one last trick to\nshow you, bub!
scissor_seal_m03_02a	{d}{s[150]}NYARGLEBARGLE!{s[100]}{/d}
scissor_seal_m03_02a_02	{d}I'm not finished yet!{/d}
scissor_seal_m03_02b	You'll never climb up there to get it.\nEnjoy your sad little day of crying!\x0e\0\x04\0{d}Bye, cheater!{/d}
scissor_seal_m03_03	Who in the world was that?\nHe had some issues.\x0e\x04\x02\0\x0e\0\x04\0Still, to be able to wield that kind of\npower... Wow.\x0e\0\x04\0In any case, we've got problems.\nUntil we deal with that bridge, we're \nnot going anywhere.\x0e\0\x04\0Let's figure something out!
pape_tuto_01	OK then, let's get this bridge back\nto the way it was.\x0e\0\x04\0From here on out, I'll lend you my \npower whenever you need it, OK?\nAre you ready?
pape_tuto_03	OK. Let's do this! Time to...\x0e\0\x04\0{d}{s[150]}PAPERIZE!{s[100]}{/d}
pape_tuto_04	How's that? Mind blown? Yeah.\nTime's stopped, and the world's become\nas flat as a piece of paper. That's what\nI call "paperization"!\x0e\0\x04\0Grab that bridge scrap you just\npicked up from the bottom screen. 
pape_tuto_04_01	Yeah, that's it. Now stick that scrap\nwhere the bridge was.\x0e\0\x04\0Line up that scrap's shadow with where\nyou want to stick it using \x0e\x02\x02\x16\x0c\0m\0i\0c\0_\0s\0t\0\x12\0\x05\0\x18\0\x18\0...\nThen stick away with \x0e\x02\x02\x14\n\0m\0i\0c\0_\0a\0\x12\0\x05\0\x18\0\x18\0.\x0e\0\x04\0{d}Give it a stick!{/d}
pape_tuto_04_02	That's it! Nice!\x0e\0\x04\0Now, for the finishing touch, smooth\nout the scrap all the way to the edges\nusing \x0e\x02\x02\x16\x0c\0m\0i\0c\0_\0s\0t\0\x12\0\x05\0\x18\0\x18\0.
pape_tuto_07_not	Ah... Not quite. The scrap's position is\na little off.\x0e\0\x04\0Look carefully at the bridge's shadow,\nand line the scrap up exactly where the\nbridge was peeled out.\x0e\0\x04\0You're new to this, so it might seem a\nbit tough, but do your best!\x0e\0\x04\0Now focus. Use \x0e\x02\x02\x16\x0c\0m\0i\0c\0_\0s\0t\0\x12\0\x05\0\x18\0\x18\0 to line the scrap up\nwith where you want to stick it.\x0e\0\x04\0{d}One more time!{/d}
pape_tuto_09	{d}You did it!{/d}\x0e\0\x04\0Not bad at all. You've got potential.\nYou may be true paper after all.\x0e\0\x04\0And now you'll be able to paperize\nwith \x0e\x02\x02\x14\n\0m\0i\0c\0_\0y\0\x12\0\x05\0\x18\0\x18\0 at any time!\x0e\0\x04\0Stick scraps back on where they've\nbeen torn out, stick stickers in \nsuspicious places... With paperization,\nyou can do all kinds of things.\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x02\x02\x14\n\0m\0i\0c\0_\0y\0\x12\0\x05\0\x18\0\x18\0 for paperization! Don't forget!
goalstar_01	Hey! \x0e\x04\x04\x04d\0\0\0Look over there!
goalstar_02	That's a piece of the Sticker Comet\nthat I rode in on! Remember, the one\nthat got broken up?\x0e\0\x04\0Since they're all from the Sticker \nStar, the Sticker Comet and Royal \nStickers are naturally drawn to each\nother by their homeland's power.\x0e\0\x04\0So if we gather the comet pieces, \nthey should naturally lead us to the \nRoyal Stickers.\x0e\0\x04\0And what's more, if we defeat lots of \nenemies in battle, we can get tons of\ncoins! Nothing wrong with that!\x0e\0\x04\0So let's get those comet pieces and \nuse them to lead the way to all the\nRoyal Stickers!
trio_kuri_01	Hold up.
trio_kuri_06	Heh heh heh heh. Niiiiiice.\nLooks like he hasn't noticed us.
trio_kuri_07	Well, well, WELL! You again!\nYou're looking thin and flimsy as a\npiece of tissue paper!\x0e\0\x04\0Get him while he's off guard!
trio_kuri_02	{d}Uh-oh! He noticed us!{/d}
trio_kuri_03	Last time we weren't prepared, and you\nbeat us like flat, little pi\xf1atas.\x0e\0\x04\0But this time won't be so easy!\nTaste our paper power, punk!
trio_kuri_04	No matter how many times you want\nto play, it'll always end the same.\nTaste our paper power!
trio_kuri_05	He's back, for real! We really are flimsy,\nlittle, flat pi\xf1atas!
trio_kuri_08	Wa ha ha! He ran away! He bolted!\nPoor little guy didn't want any paper\ncuts, I guess!
trio_kuri_09	Huh? He's back! This guy doesn't know\nwhen to quit!
signboard_ac_01	With any attack,\ntiming is really crucial.\nPress that A Button.
signboard_ac_02	When you're in a fight...\nAnd foes are about to strike...\nPress that A Button.

flo_tlk_01	Such a gale! An ill wind, to be sure!\nI cannot ford the tempest!
flo_tlk_04	The horror! My beautiful blooms, each\na masterpiece of nature, have been \nscattered to the four winds...
flo_tlk_06	Lo, I struggle in the tempest once more!\nMy flowers will once again meet their\nend on the uncaring wind!
flo_tlk_repairhint_00	My blistering blooms of burning red...\nMy frigid flowers of iciest blue...\nAll of them blown from this world!\nBAWWWWWWWW!
flo_tlk_repairhint_01	What's this? A flower struggles forth\nfrom the earth? This cheers me, but \nonly a trifle, for a single flower does\nnot a garden make.
flo_tlk_repairhint_02	What's this? A brace of blooms awaken\nin the sleeping ground? This gives me\njoy, but not elation, for they are not\nquite enough to make a garden.
flo_tlk_papeNG_Noseal	What's this? For a moment my heart\nlurched in anticipation of a flower\nblooming, but it appears I was mistaken.
flo_kino_result_normal	Oh joy! Flowers burst forth!
flo_kino_result_kira	Oh joy! Oh, such joy in my heart!\nFlowers burst forth! SHINY flowers!
flo_kino_result_kirakira	Oh joy! The joy to end all joys!\nFlowers burst forth! Flashy flowers that\nrival the flaring sun o'er us all!
flo_kino_result_thx	I must thank you, Mario, for your \nsticker skills are positively uncanny! \x0e\0\x04\0Most impressive. I insist you take this!
flo_tlk_repairsecond_02	Flowers are the definition of beauty.\nAnd now they may thrive, for the wind\nhas finally abated.
flo_tlk_repairsecond_04	My poor flowers, lost to the winds...\nHow much must a Toad suffer...
kino_vs_kuri_02	C'mon, buddy, whazzat you was just\nholdin'? Show it to us, huh?
kino_vs_kuri_03	Yeah, your act is gettin' old fast.\nBreak out the goods. Now.
kino_vs_kuri_01	Quit it! Knock it off!
kino_vs_kuri_04	Heads up--it's Mario!\x0e\0\x04\0What're you lookin' at? We was just\nplayin', nice and friendly-like.
kino_vs_kuri_06	What, you got a playdate with this\ntwerp or somethin'? In that case...\x0e\0\x04\0For 20 coins, we'll give 'im up.\nWhatcha gonna do?\x0e\x03\0(\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0\x1e\0k\0i\0n\0o\0_\0v\0s\0_\0k\0u\0r\0i\0_\00\08\0
kino_vs_kuri_06_01	Hey, it's Mario again!
kino_vs_kuri_07	Yeah, so I get it. You musta not heard\nme the first time.\x0e\0\x04\0Clean the ears, and I'll ask you again.\x0e\0\x04\0For 20 coins, we'll give this chump up.\nWhatcha wanna do?\x0e\x03\0(\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0\x1e\0k\0i\0n\0o\0_\0v\0s\0_\0k\0u\0r\0i\0_\00\08\0
kino_vs_kuri_08	Pay 20 coins.\nStomp them and save the Toad.
kino_vs_kuri_09	Whoa, what?! Are you for real?\nMan, you really ARE a good guy!
kino_vs_kuri_10	Hey, it was worth tryin', am I right?\nThanks for the coins! See ya!
kino_vs_kuri_10_01	You don't even have enough coins!\nGet this fool!
kino_vs_kuri_11	You wanna save this little guy?\nTell me you didn't just say that.\x0e\0\x04\0Fair warning, bud. We're, like, a full ply\ntougher than the average Goomba.\nStill wanna fight us?\x0e\x03\0(\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0\x1e\0k\0i\0n\0o\0_\0v\0s\0_\0k\0u\0r\0i\0_\01\02\0
kino_vs_kuri_12	Trounce them and save the Toad.\nThink on it for a moment...
kino_vs_kuri_13	You got some guts! Pretty stupid guts, \nbut hey. Time to put your boots where\nyour mouth is!
kino_vs_kuri_18	Ah, so THAT'S what it feels like to get\nthoroughly stomped. We give up!
kino_vs_kuri_19	Thank you, Mario!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm sorry for causing all that trouble...\nThe truth is, just a bit ago I found this \nreally rare thing.
kino_vs_kuri_20	See? Isn't it amazing? I have no idea\nwhat it is, but it looks COOL.\x0e\0\x04\0Anyway, I want you to have it for\nsaving me. Please, take it!\x0e\0\x04\0If you don't need it, you can always \ngive it to someone who likes rare things.\x0e\0\x04\0Well, I'd better be going now. \nSee you later!
pentagon_kuri_00	{d}Hold your horses!{/d}
pentagon_kuri_01	You! You think Goombas are just cheap\nlittle single-ply secondary characters? \x0e\0\x04\0Think again! We're going on a Goomba\njoyride, and we're gonna roll over you\nlike a little red speed bump!
pentagon_kuri_04	OK, OK, you beat us! No more joyrides.\nWe'll be safe drivers from here on out.
pentagon_kuri_06	Hey, not a fan of joyriding? Tough!
pentagon_kuri_07	You're back, which means you think you\ncan win, which means you are clueless.\nPrepare to get rolled!
slot_open_event_00_00	Well now, that was quite an entrance.\nThese guys may be small-time toughs,\nbut five of them in a gang is trouble.
slot_open_event_00	But, wait--what am I thinking?!\x0e\0\x04\0I just remembered something, Mario.\nWouldn't you be able to mop up these\nguys a lot faster if you could use more\nthan one sticker at a time?\x0e\x03\0.\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0$\0s\0l\0o\0t\0_\0o\0p\0e\0n\0_\0e\0v\0e\0n\0t\0_\00\01\0
slot_open_event_01	Yeah!\nNot really.
slot_open_event_02	Really? No kidding! You really think\nthat? Either you're nuts, or...you're\njust messing around and you DO want\nme to tell you how, right?\x0e\x03\0.\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0$\0s\0l\0o\0t\0_\0o\0p\0e\0n\0_\0e\0v\0e\0n\0t\0_\00\01\0
slot_open_event_03	No one's going to think less of you for\nwanting an advantage! Now, come on!\nYou want to use more stickers at once,\nright?\x0e\x03\0.\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0$\0s\0l\0o\0t\0_\0o\0p\0e\0n\0_\0e\0v\0e\0n\0t\0_\00\01\0
slot_open_event_04	YOU ARE LYING. I mean, come ON!\nAre you AFRAID to use more than one\nsticker at a time? Seriously, you want\nto learn this.\x0e\x03\0.\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0$\0s\0l\0o\0t\0_\0o\0p\0e\0n\0_\0e\0v\0e\0n\0t\0_\00\01\0
slot_open_event_05	You know what? Forget you!\nHere--pick one of these answers so we\ncan move on.\x0e\x03\0.\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0$\0s\0l\0o\0t\0_\0o\0p\0e\0n\0_\0e\0v\0e\0n\0t\0_\00\06\0
slot_open_event_06	Yes.\nYeah.
slot_open_event_07	Right, right! You think so too, huh?\nWell, I've got good news!\x0e\0\x04\0And here it is!
slot_open_event_08	Ta-dah! The Battle Spinner!\x0e\0\x04\0Just stop these spinning wheels with\n\x0e\x02\x02\x14\n\0m\0i\0c\0_\0a\0\x12\0\x05\0\x18\0\x18\0 and try to match pictures.\x0e\0\x04\0The number of pictures you match\ndetermines how many stickers you can\nuse at once!
slot_open_event_09	Oh, too bad... No matches, huh?\nWell, it WAS your first time...\x0e\0\x04\0All right! Just this once, you get a little\nspecial treatment!
slot_open_event_10	Look! Now you can use three stickers\nat once!\x0e\0\x04\0What's more, when you match three\npictures, something good happens!\x0e\0\x04\0For example, this time you matched\nthree coins, so you got a coin bonus!\x0e\0\x04\0Pretty great, huh? Next time, try to\nmatch it up by yourself!
slot_open_event_11	Hey, you matched two! Now you can\nuse two stickers at once!\x0e\0\x04\0Still, it could've been better...\nIf you'd matched three, you could have\nused THREE stickers...\x0e\0\x04\0All right, fine! Just this once, you get\na little special treatment!
slot_open_event_13	Good job! You get to use three stickers\nat once!\x0e\0\x04\0But of all the things to match... \nThose guys are Poison Mushrooms! \nIf you match them, that's what we call\n"failing." Ah well, such is life.
slot_open_event_14	Good job! Now you can use three\nstickers at once!\x0e\0\x04\0And since you got three coins, you get\na coin bonus!\x0e\0\x04\0If you keep using the Battle Spinner like\nyou just did, you'll be fine.
slot_open_event_15	If you pay a few coins during battle, \nyou can have a spin on the Battle \nSpinner. Use them wisely!\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, and if you pay a lot of coins, it gets\neasier to get a jackpot, so use it well!
slot_open_event_16	Wow, great! Now you can use three\nstickers at once.\x0e\0\x04\0And by the way, since you got all\nMushrooms, you got some HP restored!\x0e\0\x04\0If you keep using the Battle Spinner as\nwell as you just did, you'll be fine.
slot_open_event_17	All right! You got all Fire Flowers!\nBIG WINNER! DING DING DING!\x0e\0\x04\0You can use three stickers at once\nAND unleash fireballs.\x0e\0\x04\0If you keep using the Battle Spinner like\nthat, you'll be fine.
slot_open_event_18	Great job! You got all POW Blocks.\nBIG WINNER! DING DING DING!\x0e\0\x04\0You get to use three stickers at once\nAND deal some damage to enemies.\x0e\0\x04\0If you keep using the Battle Spinner like\nthat, you'll be fine.
slot_open_event_19	Wow! Awesome! You got all Lightning.\nBIG WINNER! DING DING DING!\x0e\0\x04\0You get to use three stickers at once\nAND deal some damage to enemies.\x0e\0\x04\0If you keep using the Battle Spinner as\nwell as that, you'll do fine.

kinopio_butsukaru_after_04	Hey, Mario.\x0e\0\x04\0I wanted to tell you, I'm positive I saw a\nfalling star drop somewhere near the \nWater's Edge waterfall.\x0e\0\x04\0It was sparkly and shiny, just like the\nSticker Comet!

kameck_appear_04	You little scamp... Hiding something \ngood in your pocket even when I ask\never so politely to have a look at it. \nVery suspicious, indeed.\x0e\0\x04\0I imagine it's something quite rare...\nand something to do with stickers. \nI'm afraid I will be obliged to relieve you\nof it and report you to King Bowser!
kameck_appear_05	Oh my, and who could this be?\nIf it isn't little Mario!\x0e\0\x04\0Keh heh heh... That little incident at\nthe Sticker Fest has gotten you on the\nmove, has it? How lovely for us all.\x0e\0\x04\0You know, when I think "little Mario," \nI think "Bowser's perpetual enemy." \nWhich makes you MY enemy.\x0e\0\x04\0Yes... Well, this will seem rather rude \nsince we've only just met, but...\x0e\0\x04\0Let's get you out of the way quickly, \nshall we? Prepare for ruin!

kamk_battlefnish_evvent14	Oopsie, did it just fly off somewhere?\nOh dear.\x0e\0\x04\0But I told you to catch it, didn't I? \nAnd you failed. Ka ha ha ha ha ha!\x0e\0\x04\0Oh well. Best of luck!
kamk_battlefnish_evvent05	What was THAT?! A precious comet \npiece getting tossed around like a toy?\x0e\0\x04\0UGH!

join_kinopio_2nd_enemy_00	Oh, thank goodness! You haven't \nleft me to fend for myself.\x0e\0\x04\0Listen, I don't mean to be such a wuss,\nbut I'm not a fighter like you, Mario.\nWe don't all stomp, like, a hundred\nGoombas before breakfast.\x0e\0\x04\0If you could just beat up any scary bad\nguys for me, that'd really help me out.\x0e\0\x04\0OK, so I'm going to follow you again...\nPlease take me back to town!

No sign of it, man!\nThe good, nourishing water dried up... \nThe plants withered away to dust...\nAll because of Bowser.\x0e\0\x04\0Ah, man... It was just so...so LUSH.\nY'know what I'm saying? The water jug\nwas like...runnething OVER, y'know?\nOh, to bring back those days...
oasis_kino_01_2	The water flowed like...well, water...\nVegetation grew green and strong...\nIt was a place of rejuvenation...\nA place of peace.\x0e\0\x04\0And now you don't see any sign of it.\nThe water is but a memory... The plants\nare gray ghosts baking in the heat... \nAnd all because of Bowser.\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, we hardly knew ye, lush oasis... \nBack when the world was young and\nthe water jug bubbled to the brim... \nBring back those days...
oasis_kino_02	Oh, hey, man.\x0e\0\x04\0Listen, major props for restoring the \noasis back to the way it was.\x0e\0\x04\0I'm sure you know this, but when you're\nin the desert, water is the BOB-OMB.\nSeriously. I haven't felt this mellow in\npretty much forever.\x0e\0\x04\0So I, uh... I kinda changed in a hurry, \nso it might still be a mess inside... \nIt's no biggie, though. You should take\na load off and relax too.
oasis_kino_03	Huh? What's the matter, man?\nAren't you mellowed out yet?\x0e\0\x04\0You probably noticed it's kind of a mess\ninside, since I changed in a hurry...\nbut can you really blame a Toad?\nC'mon, take a load off and chill!
oasis_kino_04	You check out that treasure chest in\nthe armoire? You find what you need in\nthere? It's cool, lemme hook you up.\x0e\0\x04\0The sandstorm must've scooped that\nthing up and blown it here, so I snagged\nit. No idea what it is, actually.\x0e\0\x04\0I'm feeling ultramellow myself, so I \ndon't need it. It's all you, man!
oasis_kino_05	I'm as mellow as a marshmallow. \nYou're the best, man!
oasis_doorlocking	Oh, it's locked.
oasis_explore_kino_0	THE LEGEND OF THE HIDDEN OASIS\nMUST BE TRUE! IT MUST BE!\x0e\0\x04\0WHAT? I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE\nMADNESS OF THIS SANDSTORM!\nIS THAT WHIRLWIND THE CAUSE OF ALL\nTHIS BLOWING SAND?
oasis_explore_kino_1	Well, Mario, you've managed to discover\nthe oasis before me. Bully for you.\x0e\0\x04\0BUT! It was I who just now succeeded in\ndeciphering this mysterious slate!\x0e\0\x04\0And now it is I who will be the one \ndiscovering some sweet secret first!

hana_wakeup_09	If Bowser's flunkies are traipsing around\nhere, then a Royal Sticker is sure to be\nin this forest too.\x0e\0\x04\0Well, Wiggler supposedly knows this\nforest pretty well, so I'll bet we can get\nsome good information from him.
hana_wakeup_10	MA-MA-MA-MARIO! Did you see that?\nWiggler just disappeared!
hana_wakeup_10_2	Huh. You don't seem too fazed...\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x04\x02\0I guess maybe he wasn't having that\nmuch fun and decided to run back to\nhis house.

hana_mezame_01	Huh? Are you Wiggler? Why aren't you\nsleeping in your house like a normal...\ngiant thing?
hana_mezame_02	Hey, you're right. Why was Wiggler\nsleeping in a place like this?\x0e\0\x04\0Oh yes, it was because Wiggler filled up\non leaves and got super sleepy.\nWiggler hasn't eaten that much in a\nlong time.
hana_mezame_03	Lately this forest has been covered in \nicky, goopy poison...\x0e\0\x04\0Wiggler's favorite leaves also got\ncovered in icky, goopy poison, and so\nWiggler couldn't eat them anymore...\x0e\0\x04\0So Wiggler came all the way to the\nforest's entrance looking for clean\nleaves to nibble.
hana_mezame_04	Wait, everything's covered in poison?!\nThat sounds like the work of Bowser!\nQuick, we have to do something!
hana_mezame_05	Huh? You mean you'll help out?\nWiggler has the appetite of a growing\nWiggler, so if you get rid of that poison,\nWiggler will be so happy!\x0e\0\x04\0Wiggler will take you to Wiggler's house.\nWe can talk about this there.

morimono_kino_01	Welcome, customer! Please sling and\nfling things to your heart's content.
morimono_kino_02	Oh, you're out of things to sling?\nI see, I see.\x0e\0\x04\0That's really a shame, not being able\nto just, you know, sling it. Poor thing.\x0e\0\x04\0{s[075]}OK, listen. In town, right? If you head to the \nthing-slinging stall, maybe there might just be a guy\naround there who can help you...{s[100]}
morimono_kino_03	Huh? Looks like there's no space left\nin your sticker album, customer.\x0e\0\x04\0Come back once you've gone to that\nshop there and sold off some stickers.
morimono_kino_04	You've flung everything you can fling. \nYou're quite the enthusiastic customer! \nWay to sling it.
hana_travel_3_11	Calm down, kiddo. We'll do something\nabout the poison. Don't worry.
mori_ranger_00	Late is the hour of my introduction,\nand for this, I beg forgiveness. I am but\na humble Toad who loves these woods.\x0e\0\x04\0Word reached my ears of the aid you\nlent that poor child of the forest.\nUndaunted by both fume and foulness,\nyou stood firm and prevailed.\x0e\0\x04\0May your days be ever Toadful. \nI say these words of thanks to you on\nbehalf of the woods, who speak not in\nthe ways of men.\x0e\0\x04\0I can think of no pleasure greater than\nusing my knowledge of these woods and\nthe surrounding areas to help you on\nfuture adventures.\x0e\0\x04\0Be not a stranger should your\nwanderings bring us together again.\nIt is my duty to speak of the woods\nwith all who love the trees.
mori_ranger_01	A bridge there once was, over the \nentrance to majestic Loop Loop River.\nBut that bridge has crumbled under the\nweight of time's cruel march...\x0e\0\x04\0And lo, where the bridge once arched,\nnow a void looms in defiance of nature.\nOne sees nothing--no bridge, no lack of\nbridge, but just...nothingness.
mori_ranger_02	From the front, one sees naught.\nBut if one looks beyond and behind,\nthe way forward becomes clear.\x0e\0\x04\0Tree Branch Trail is but a path one can\ntread forth and back, and at the back\nof that path is the path to the back. 
mori_ranger_03	Deep within the Bafflewood, hidden from\nprying eyes, sleeps a sacred orb of \ndeep, lustrous black.\x0e\0\x04\0But the path to its secret nook is \nblocked by a magical barrier known as\na fence--a device so ingenious, it can\nonly be broken by the throes of a child.\x0e\0\x04\0Quoted from The Book of Spares,\nchapter 12, section 8.
mori_ranger_04	Do not fear the poison, for it too, is a\nnatural creation of this good world. \nSometimes one must simply be brave \nand jump right into what one fears.\x0e\0\x04\0Of course, I would not leap into poison.\nI am not a lunatic. But I jump into holes\nwith no poison whenever I can.
mori_ranger_05	From my vantage here, I bore witness to\nall that transpired on that little island.\x0e\0\x04\0Undeceived by the strange dance of\nthat fell creature, you stood brave and\ntrue and fought with a righteous fury.\nYour prize? A glittering sticker.\x0e\0\x04\0And then the poison was no more!\x0e\0\x04\0MAY YOUR DAYS BE EVER TOADFUL!\nI say these words of thanks to you on\nbehalf of the woods, for whom it is my\nprivilege to speak.\x0e\0\x04\0Now I shall retreat into reflection and\nwatch over from afar the growth of the\nyoung child of the woods.
mori_ranger_06	Cast your eyes upon that small island.
mori_ranger_07	The forest, once fair, is now foul and\ndebased by the poison that flows from\nthat island like a doomsday tide. \nAll that is green may be destroyed.\x0e\0\x04\0What has set this cruel fate in motion?\nThe answer lies on that island, and it\nfalls to you to journey there.\x0e\0\x04\0But the shipwreck that decorates the\nisland like a skeleton's jewelry whispers\na grim warning in your ear.
mori_ranger_08	Mario, THAT'S where the poison is\ncoming from!\x0e\0\x04\0If we don't find a way out to that\nisland and stop that stuff from flowing,\nthe woods will never go back to normal.
mori_ranger_08_2	I am sure that ship's course leads back\nto that small island.\x0e\0\x04\0Someone must travel there and stop the\npoison flow, or the forest will slumber\nbeneath its poison mantle forever!
mori_ranger_09	Word reached my ears that you two\nsaved these precious woods.\x0e\0\x04\0May your days be ever Toadful.\nI say these words of thanks to you on\nbehalf of the woods, who whisper them\nin my ear in rustling verse.\x0e\0\x04\0I awaited you here, eager to offer my \nknowledge of the forest as aid for your\nadventure, but...\x0e\0\x04\0Now that the woods know peace once\nmore, there is no need.\x0e\0\x04\0I shall retreat into reflection and \nwatch over from afar the growth of the\nyoung child of the woods.
mori_ranger_10	Now I shall retreat into reflection and\nwatch over from afar the growth of the\nyoung child of the woods.
mori_ranger_11	I have been vigilant. I have watched \nover that child as he grew.\x0e\0\x04\0Of this I am sure: his heart will be\ngladdened at your visit.\n

hana_Search04B_3_12_04	Easy there, little guy! Don't you realize\nyou're covered in poison? Don't you \nwant to get cleaned up before you go \npicking any more fights?\x0e\0\x04\0Look, I know getting split up by Kamek's\nmagic is no kind of fun. Which makes\nsense, because Kamek is no kind of fun.\x0e\0\x04\0But you taking advantage of all this\nmadness to go wilding with Bloopers\nis just wrong! You're better than that!\x0e\0\x04\0Anyway, this whole situation is nuts.\nSo let's get this over with!
hana_wait01_03	Come on! Wiggler has been waiting! \nQuickly, let's get to that island!\x0e\0\x04\0Soon that poison will be gone and\nWiggler will eat delicious leaves again! \nWiggler can almost taste them!
hana_wait01_15	I like your enthusiasm, but let's not be\ntoo hasty, Wiggler...
hana_wait01_16	Mario, there could be anything waiting\nfor us on that island... We'd better\nmake sure we're prepared.\x0e\0\x04\0With Kamek involved, you can pretty\nmuch count on the fact that something\nbad is out there.
hana_wait01_04	Wiggler is very ready! Can we head for\nthe island now? \x0e\x03\0&\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0\x1c\0h\0a\0n\0a\0_\0w\0a\0i\0t\00\01\0_\00\05\0
hana_wait01_05	Mario is ready!\nMario is not ready.
hana_wait01_06	Well then, Wiggler will wait here.
hana_wait01_07	Yay! OK! Then get on Wiggler.
hana_wait01_08	OK! Let's go!
hana_wait01_08_01	When Wiggler was first split into\nsegments, Wiggler was sad, but...\x0e\0\x04\0Thanks to you, Wiggler's segments saw\nmany things in many places.\x0e\0\x04\0Still, seeing you two have to gather\nWiggler's segments as they ran here\nand there like maniacs...\x0e\0\x04\0It made Wiggler think that maybe \nWiggler needs to be a little bit more\nresponsible.
hana_wait01_08_02	Hee hee hee... Wiggler, you've learned \na lot, haven't you?\x0e\0\x04\0It sounds like this whole ordeal made\nyou grow up just a little.
hana_wait01_08_03	YAAAAAAY! Wiggler is a grown-up! \nWiggler's going to eat beautiful leaves\nby the ton and grow up even more!
hana_wait01_08_04	That's right! That's why we have to \nstop that poison as quickly as possible\nand return the forest to normal.\x0e\0\x04\0Ah, I can finally see the island.
hana_wait01_09	Wiggler will wait here. Mario, Kersti...\nPlease take care of the poison!
hana_wait01_10	Mario, let's go. Let's find the source of\nthat icky, overflowing poison!
hana_wait01_11	Come back to Wiggler safe and sound!
hana_wait02_01	Go back to Whitecap Beach? \x0e\x03\0&\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0\x1c\0h\0a\0n\0a\0_\0w\0a\0i\0t\00\02\0_\00\02\0
hana_wait02_02	Go back!\nStay here.
hana_wait02_03	Really? OK, Wiggler will wait here.

lucie_cry_00	AAAAAH! Mario!
lucie_cry_04	In case you never noticed, I don't have\narms or legs. So DO SOMETHING.
lucie_cry_01	{d}{s[150]}WHAT WERE YOU DOING?!{s[100]}{/d}
lucie_cry_02	While you were off gallivanting about,\nI got kidnapped by those creeps and\nhung up like a painting. Not fun at all!
lucie_cry_02_2	Not only that, but that sticky web was \nchafing me like you would not believe! \nLeaving me hanging there was \ncompletely and utterly unacceptable!
lucie_cry_03	...Phew...\x0e\0\x04\0Well, despite all that, I'm grateful you\nsaved me.\x0e\0\x04\0Eventually...\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x04\x04\x04\xe8\x03\0\0Anyway, thanks.
lucie_cry_06	Hey, wait! You lost your hammer?!\nWe'd better hurry up and find it!\x0e\0\x04\0OK, let's go!
stg3_6.msbt
hana_head_14	Wait! Hang on, Mario. First, we need to\nfind Wiggler's segment.\x0e\0\x04\0Let's grab the comet piece afterward.
hana_head_15	Wait, Mario. Let's get the comet piece\nafter we've helped the second segment.\x0e\0\x04\0If we have a zillion possible places to go\nnext, we're just going to end up getting\nconfused, don't you think?
hana_atama_01	Mario... Over here...
hana_atama_02	What in the world?! Wiggler!\nYikes...
hana_atama_02_01	You've definitely, um...lost some weight,\nhaven't you?
hana_atama_03	Yeah... At the forest entrance...\nWiggler was grabbed by these long,\nslimy tentacles...
hana_kaisou_01	Stop it! Let Wiggler go!
hana_kaisou_02	Not so rough! You'll rip Wiggler!
hana_kaisou_03	Ahhhh, I've been looking high and low\nfor you, my naughty little caterpillar.\x0e\0\x04\0Yes, I very much wanted to meet you!\nIn fact, I came all the way out to your\nhouse expressly to see you, but sadly,\nyou weren't at home.\x0e\0\x04\0No, instead, it seems you've been at\nthe forest entrance planning some sort\nof mischief with Mario and his friend.
hana_kaisou_04	Who? What? Why?\x0e\0\x04\0Wiggler only wanted to eat delicious\nleaves, not make any mischief.
hana_kaisou_05	Keh heh heh... Oh, please.\nSimply by being here, you're causing me\nall sorts of problems.\x0e\0\x04\0And so I'm going to show you just a\nlittle bit of magic. Very fun magic...\nKah hah hah!
hana_kaisou_06	Huh? Fun? YAAAAAAAAAAAY!\nHurry, hurry!
hana_kaisou_07	KYAAAAAA hah hah haaaaaaaaa!\nOh, you all look like you're having such\nFUN now that you're free! Ah, children. \nSo spunky. So mischievous.\x0e\0\x04\0OK, kiddos, go play whatever you want \noutside! You know, tag or hide-and-seek\nor kick-the-Goomba or something.
hana_kaisou_08	Ah. That's better, isn't it?\x0e\0\x04\0You know, I envy you, getting to play\nyour whole life away.
hana_kaisou_12	In any case, I'm off. Toodles.
hana_kaisou_09	Wiggler's lost his...\x0e\0\x04\0His body.
hana_atama2_01	There, there, little Wiggler. Calm down.
hana_atama2_02	Listen, Mario.\x0e\0\x04\0That Kamek's a pretty wily guy, right?\nI doubt he'd do something so cruel\nwithout an ulterior motive.
hana_atama2_03	Well, one way or another, this poor kid\nreally needs to get his feet back.\nLet's go find those segments!
hana_atama2_04	YAAAY! You'll really find Wiggler's body\nfor Wiggler?!\x0e\0\x04\0Wiggler has four segments in all...\nThey're probably running around,\nplaying games, and having fun all over \nthe place.\x0e\0\x04\0Wiggler thinks catching them all will be\nhard, but you can do it!\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, and please don't hurt them.
hana_atama2_05	Wow, just like a kid, huh? So resilient\nand carefree! OK, we're off!
hana_help_01	Wiggler has four segments in all...\nThey're probably running around, \nplaying games, and having fun all over \nthe place.
hana_help_01_01	Wiggler thinks catching them all will be\nhard, but Wiggler knows you can do it!
hana_help_02	So nice to reunite with part of Wiggler's\nbody! Welcome back, Wiggler segment!
hana_help_02_01	Thank you! Only three to go.
hana_help_03	Yay! The second one is back!\nWelcome home, segment of Wiggler!
hana_help_03_01	Thank you! Only two to go.
hana_help_04	Yaaaaay! The third segment! Long time\nno see. It is a Wiggler reunion!
hana_help_04_01	Only one left to go!\nAlmost done!
hana_unite_01	You found all of Wiggler's segments!
hana_unite_02	OOOF! Settle down, segments!
hana_unite_03	On behalf of Wiggler's segments, allow\nWiggler to say thank you. Thank you!
hana_unite_04	All that fleeing, hiding, struggling...\nI can't say that was especially fun,\nbut thank goodness they're all safe.\x0e\0\x04\0But seriously now, won't you catch a\ncold or something if you stay like that?\nWhat do you think about maybe \nchanging back into your old self?
hana_unite_04_01	OOOOOOOO-KAAAAAAAAAAY! \nHere goes. Wiggler is reassembling.
hana_unite_04_01_2	Nnnnn... Hnnnnnggggh...
hana_unite_04_01_3	No good. Wiggler's segments won't \nstick back together.
hana_unite_04_02	Hmmmm... Kamek's magic must be \npretty strong.\x0e\0\x04\0Well, let's give it a try.
hana_unite_04_03	OK, Mario, here we go!
hana_unite_04_04	{d}Alley-OOP!{/d}
hana_unite_04_05	I have to be honest... This'll be the first\ntime I've tried using paperization on\nsomething that's alive.\x0e\0\x04\0But he's made of the same papery\nstuff as the rest of the world, right?\nYeah, it should work fine. The rest is up\nto you, Mario.\x0e\0\x04\0We'll do this the same way as normal\npaperization. Now let's stick Wiggler's\nsegments back together for him!
hana_unite_04_09	The last piece!
hana_unite_06	Yaaaay! Wiggler is back to normal!\x0e\0\x04\0All thanks to Mario and Kersti. \nThank you!
hana_unite_07	But...even though Wiggler is back to\nnormal, the woods are still covered in\npoison ickiness.\x0e\0\x04\0Walking over poison is no problem, \nbut Wiggler can't eat poison leaves!\nThat would taste awfully terrible! \nWiggler might never eat again...
hana_unite_07_2	Wait a minute!\x0e\0\x04\0Kamek must have known Wiggler could\nwalk over poison...\x0e\0\x04\0I bet he used his magic to break Wiggler\nup so he couldn't get to that island!
hana_unite_07_22	That is just DIRTY! I don't get mad too\neasily, but that Kamek really STINKS!
hana_unite_07_3	Yes, Wiggler agrees. Kamek does stink.\nAnd Wiggler tries to stay cool most of\nthe time, but...
hana_unite_08	NOW WIGGLER HAS HAD ENOUGH!\x0e\0\x04\0Wiggler is going to that island and\ncleaning up that poison!\x0e\0\x04\0Mario! Kersti! Wiggler will be waiting at\nWhitecap Beach!
hana_unite_09	Wow, he can really fire himself up!\x0e\0\x04\0Well, let's go to Whitecap Beach too. \nWe'll finally see where that poison is\ncoming from!
hana_miss_combin_01	Huh? Wiggler thought everything was\ngoing smoothly...but Wiggler feels like\nsome segments aren't connected?
hana_miss_combin_02	Huh? Wiggler thought everything was\ngoing smoothly...but Wiggler feels like\nsome segments aren't connected?
hana_miss_combin_03	Hmmm... Wiggler is feeling smooshed.\nLike Wiggler is stuck to himself too much\nsomewhere.
hana_miss_combin_04	Hmmm... Wiggler is feeling smooshed.\nLike Wiggler is stuck to himself too much\nsomewhere.
hana_miss_combin_05	Oh, sorry, Wiggler.\x0e\0\x04\0Mario, try to remember the way \nWiggler looked before. Try again!
diary_DOR_00	Dear Book of Wiggler:\nThe poison from the ocean has flowed\ninto the forest. This frustrates Wiggler.
diary_CHO_06	Dear Book of Wiggler:\nWiggler saw a white flower today, and\nit floated away in a puff. That was fun!
diary_STA_02	Dear Book of Wiggler:\nA guy in red was in the hot springs. \nWiggler also got kind of red.
diary_BEA_01	Dear Book of Wiggler:\nWiggler stumbled into a fun game show!\nIt had a quiz. A very hard quiz.\nWiggler got nothing right.
diary_MAC_02	Dear Book of Wiggler:\nWiggler wanted to ride a boat to stop\nthe poison, but someone said no.
hana_growup_00	Mario! Kersti! The poison's disappeared!\nThe forest is clean!\x0e\0\x04\0All thanks to you two. Thank you!
hana_growup_00_2	And thanks to you carrying us to that \nisland, Wiggler, we managed to get back\na very important sticker.\x0e\0\x04\0So thank YOU, Wiggler! Now that the \nleaves are clean, you should eat as \nmuch as you want!
hana_growup_00_3	YAYYYYY! Since Wiggler's tummy's \nbeen so empty all this time, Wiggler can\neat nonstop!\x0e\0\x04\0Now Wiggler will grow fast!
hana_growup_00_4	Right! Eat a lot, and you'll grow big!
hana_growup_00_5	Turned out great, didn't it, Mario?
hana_growup_01	Since Wiggler's tummy's been so empty\nall this time, Wiggler can eat as much \nas Wiggler wants!
hana_growup_02	Wiggler's been hungry for so long...\nThese clean leaves sure taste great!
hana_growup_03	Wiggler's so happy the forest is clean.\nThese leaves taste INCREDIBLE!
hana_growup_04	The clean leaves sure are tasty, and \nWiggler's pretty full, but Wiggler can\nstill eat WAYYYYY more!\x0e\0\x04\0Does this mean Wiggler's growing?
hana_growup_05	Whoa. Wiggler ate tons of clean leaves\nand now Wiggler's full.\x0e\0\x04\0And by the way, a little while ago, \nthe rear of Wiggler's body turned red. \nWhat is THAT all about?
hana_Adult_01	Well, what do you think? Take a look!\nWiggler ate till Wiggler's tummy was full,\nand now Wiggler grew up into Flutter!
hana_Adult_02	Wow! Flutter, I hardly recognized you!\x0e\0\x04\0This must be your true form. \nIt's just wonderful.\x0e\0\x04\0And what's that on your back? \nAre those...
hana_Adult_03	Yup, they're just what you think.\nFlutter's surprised too!\x0e\0\x04\0Flutter never thought Flutter would be\nable to fly in the sky. Life is funny!
hana_Adult_03_01	This is our answer, Mario! Let's get a \nride to the skies above Gate Cliff!
hana_Adult_03_02	Hey, Flutter, can we ask you a favor?
hana_Adult_03_03	Of course! No problem. Thanks to you,\nWiggler could grow into Flutter.\x0e\0\x04\0Flutter's one wish is to return that\nfavor, so please let Flutter escort you\nwhere you need to go!
hana_Adult_03_04	Wow, you really are all grown up now!\nThank you!\x0e\0\x04\0We'll definitely take you up on that.\nThanks for the ride!
hana_Adult_04	All aboard for the skies above Gate Cliff.\nAre you ready?\x0e\x03\0*\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0 \0h\0a\0n\0a\0_\0A\0d\0u\0l\0t\0_\00\04\0_\0y\0n\0
hana_Adult_04_yn	Ready!\nNot yet.
hana_Adult_04_yes	Yay! Then let's go! Please watch your \nstep when boarding.
hana_Adult_04_no	Flutter understands. In that case, \nFlutter will wait here. Please call on \nFlutter whenever you're ready.
hana_Adult_05	Yay, just like old times! Like the time \nwhen Wiggler took you two on his back \nto that poison island! Remember?
hana_Adult_05_2	Flutter, about those "old times"...\nYou know that was just a little while\nago, right?
hana_Adult_05_3	Oh, is that so? Flutter's childhood \nmemories feel like so long ago.\x0e\0\x04\0OK, then! Let's go!
hana_Adult_06	Huh? Maybe he's out.

yakata_kino_soto_01_lucie_2	Of course, if you're TOO terrified,\nyou don't have to. Hee hee hee!
yakata_kino_soto_03	Ah, Master Mario. I suddenly feel chills\nup and down my spine. That can't be\nnormal... What could be the cause?\x0e\0\x04\0Even when I warm myself by the bonfire,\nthe chills won't go away. I daresay I\nmay be catching a cold.

yakata_kino_soto_06	Ah, Master Mario. Those chills that had\nset up residence along my spine have \ndisappeared like they never existed.\x0e\0\x04\0I daresay I'm over that cold.
yakata_kino_soto_07	The mansion is still teeming with \nterrifying things.\x0e\0\x04\0I can feel the terror from all the way\nout here. Please, seal them all away!
yakata_kino_soto_08	There's noticeably fewer terrible things,\nbut I can still feel SOME terror.
yakata_kino_soto_10	There are considerably fewer terrible\nthings, but I'm afraid there's still a fair\namount of terror coming out of there. 
yakata_kino_soto_10_8	I feel about eight terrifying things\nstill roam the halls. Keep after them,\nMaster Mario.
yakata_kino_soto_10_7	I should think there are around seven\nof those terrifying things still at large. \nPlease keep going, Master Mario.
yakata_kino_soto_10_6	Six. Yes, six terrifying things still\nwander the grounds. Do not stop,\nMaster Mario.
yakata_kino_soto_10_5	Five terrifying things still laugh at us\nfrom the dark. Master Mario, get them! 
yakata_kino_soto_10_4	Four terrifying things creep in the\nshadows. Keep fighting, Master Mario.
yakata_kino_soto_10_3	I feel terror. If I had to quantify that\nterror, the number would be...three.\nJust a little more to go, Master Mario.
yakata_kino_soto_10_2	There is but a pair of terrifying things\nremaining, Master Mario.
yakata_kino_soto_10_1	My terror-unit reading is holding steady\nat just a single terrifying thing. \nAlmost there!
yakata_kino_soto_11	The mansion isn't terrifying anymore, \nbut Master Mario, that book most\nassuredly is. Please, make sure it is\nsafe in the basement with all speed.

yakata_boss_01	Want to put the book here?\x0e\x03\04\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0*\0y\0a\0k\0a\0t\0a\0_\0b\0o\0s\0s\0_\00\01\0_\0s\0e\0l\0e\0c\0t\0
yakata_boss_01_select	Place the book.\nDo it later.
yakata_boss_02	Nope... No good. Well, that stinks.\nLooks like we haven't sealed up all the\nBoos yet.
yakata_fuin_ok	Huh... Looks like we sealed them all.
yakata_boss_03	Mmmm... Well done.
yakata_boss_04	Finding all those naughty little Boos... \nYou're as diligent as always, Mario.
yakata_boss_05	You! Kamek! Why are you here?!\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, I get it! I bet breaking the seal on\nthe book was all your doing!
yakata_boss_06	Keh heh heh... Ah, Ms. Kersti...\nJust as sharp as ever.\x0e\0\x04\0Indeed, I heard there was an old book\nabout stickers somewhere in this \nmansion, so I searched high and low.\x0e\0\x04\0In time, I found this delightful tome and\ncracked it open, and lo and behold!\nAll of those Boos came flying out. \x0e\0\x04\0Then you two showed up and embarked\non your nice game of hide-and-seek...\nI simply had to stay and watch.\x0e\0\x04\0I must admit, it was truly wonderful\nwatching you two desperately search\nall over the place. Kah ha ha!
yakata_boss_07	What is your PROBLEM?! UGH!\nYou're just plain nasty, you know that?
yakata_boss_08	Keh keh keh... Why thank you, my dear.\nWhat a lovely compliment.\x0e\0\x04\0Even so, a book with a hundred Boos\nsealed within must hold some extreme\npower, wouldn't you think?\x0e\0\x04\0And since you two went through all\nthat trouble to complete such an\nimportant piece of literature.... \x0e\0\x04\0Let's turn things up another notch, \nshall we?
yakata_boss_09	Keh heh heh... I'm sure you'll have a\nlovely time playing with that massive\nBoo thing, won't you? Yes...\x0e\0\x04\0Well then, I must be going.
yakata_boss_after_01	Phew. Looks like it's finally all over.
yakata_boss_after_02	Master Mario! You did it, didn't you!
yakata_boss_after_03	The inside of the mansion is no longer\nterrifying whatsoever!\x0e\0\x04\0That book is sealed up, and all is back\nto normal! Thank you ever so!\x0e\0\x04\0And now, as promised, allow me to show\nyou the very finest in hospitality!\nPlease, let's adjourn to the room to the\nleft of the lobby.
yakata_boss_after_04	Hey, Kamek said he came here looking\nfor a book about stickers, right?\x0e\0\x04\0Could it have been THAT book? Nah...\nI don't think even Kamek can read \nAncient Stickerish.\x0e\0\x04\0Still, you have to wonder if maybe he\nread something in there that could\ncause us trouble...\x0e\0\x04\0Nah... No way. He just opened that \nBook of Sealing by mistake and basically\nnothing came of it, so...\x0e\0\x04\0Yeah, so that's that. All sewn up.\nAnd that Toad is waiting, so let's go to\nthe room to the left of the lobby.

yakata_toushu_02	{d}Ah, welcome.{/d}
yakata_toushu_02_2	What do you think of our magnificent\nliving room? Makes you feel rather\ninstantly at home, does it not?\x0e\0\x04\0It pleases me to no end to be able to\nprovide the hospitality that befits this\nglorious place.\x0e\0\x04\0And finally, I look like a proper steward\nagain. Perhaps it's time I advertised\nfor a manservant of my own. Oh ho ho.
yakata_toushu_02_3	Master Mario, please! No need to stand.\nDo have a seat in that chair over there.
yakata_toushu_02_4	What do you think? A grand tune, no? \nMakes a fellow feel right at home.
yakata_toushu_04	Ah, yes... That picture.\x0e\0\x04\0That was painted by the mansion's \nprevious proprietor... In other words, \nthe steward who came before me.\x0e\0\x04\0I inherited the charge of the mansion\nwhen he passed away.\x0e\0\x04\0If it interests you, I am happy to make\nyou a gift of that painting. After all, \nI am the steward now, and can\ndispense the estate as I see fit.\x0e\0\x04\0Please, do not hesitate to take it.\nSuch is our legendary hospitality!
yakata_toushu_05	Ah, to be quite honest, I feel much\nbetter without that painting.\x0e\0\x04\0I'd like to put up a picture of something\nthat makes it more MY mansion...\nPerhaps even a picture of me.
yakata_sendai_01	{d}Mm-yes, welcome.{/d}
yakata_sendai_02	Please! Standing is an affront to our\nhospitality. Have a seat in that chair\nover there.

yakata_sendai_04	It's been such a long time since we've \nhad visitors to this house. It pleases me\ngreatly, I must admit.
yakata_sendai_05	It pleases me to no end every time I can\nmake you feel welcome, Master Mario.
yakata_sendai_06	I'm also happy to make Master Mario\nfeel at home.
yakata_sendai_07	{d}Mm-yes, welcome.{/d}
yakata_sendai_08	So this sort of music is popular these\ndays? I can't say that I "get" it.

You're all sparkly! \nYou're sparkling from the Royal Sticker!\x0e\0\x04\0We're not a-\x0e\x04\x01\0afraid of you!\x0e\0\x04\0We fought our way all the way here to \npeel that Royal Sticker right off your\nnasty forehead!\x0e\0\x04\0So...
koopa_event_06_2	{d}{s[150]}GIVE IT UP!{s[100]}{/d}
koopa_event_2_01	No! The Royal Sticker fell with Bowser!
koopa_2nd_battle_01	That last Royal Sticker will be our end...\nIts sparkling power is too strong...\nOur stickers are of no use.
koopa_2nd_battle_02	Mario. It's come down to this.\x0e\0\x04\0You have to use me as a sticker.
koopa_2nd_battle_03	Listen carefully, Mario.\x0e\0\x04\0The only thing strong enough to match\nthe sparkling power of that Royal \nSticker is sparkling power originating\nfrom the same Sticker Star.\x0e\0\x04\0That can only be me. With my shine and\nyour bravery, you can strike Bowser \nwith the power of a thousand stickers!\x0e\0\x04\0Do you understand? Say you do!\nI'm going into the album now, and...\nif you sell me at a shop, I'll never\nforgive you!
koopa_2nd_battle_04	{c[f4f4f4]}Thanks for sticking me up, Mario.{c[000000]}
koopa_2nd_battle_04_2	{c[f4f4f4]}I give to you all my shine. You must win!{c[000000]}
koopa_2nd_battle_05	{c[f4f4f4]}Looking back, I realize I kind of forced\nyou to come on this adventure with me.\nI'm sorry...{c[000000]}
koopa_2nd_battle_05_2	{c[f4f4f4]}We went through a lot...but it was fun.\x0e\x04\x01\0\nAnd now...{c[000000]}
koopa_2nd_battle_06	{d}{c[f4f4f4]}Good-bye!{c[000000]}{/d}
koopa_event_3_01	Thank you, Mario. I knew I could count\non you, as always.\x0e\0\x04\0Now that the Royal Sticker's been \npeeled off, Bowser should come to his\nsenses...eventually.
koopa_event_3_04	He's been beaten flat, but that's \nnothing new, so I don't think we need\nto worry about him. He'll be OK.
koopa_event_3_02	So this all came about because of the\nsix Royal Stickers that rode in on the\ncomet the night of Sticker Fest...\x0e\0\x04\0The power to grant wishes can bring\ndisaster if used without wisdom, huh?
koopa_event_3_03	Ah, so those are the Royal Stickers....\x0e\0\x04\0I bet it was hard gathering all six.\x0e\0\x04\0But thanks to your hard work, my wish\nfor peace in the kingdom...\x0e\0\x04\0No wait! It was the wish of everyone\nthroughout the land. And it came true.
koopa_event_3_05	Now please, use the power of those \nRoyal Stickers to grant your own wish.\x0e\0\x04\0Mario, what is your wish?

before_staffroll_peach	Citizens of the Mushroom Kingdom!\x0e\0\x04\0Tonight, at long last, that symbol of \npeace, the Sticker Fest, has finally \nbeen revived.\x0e\0\x04\0But this glad day did not come to pass\nthrough the power of the Sticker Comet.\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x04\x02\0No, it was bought with the bravery of\nMario, who returned the Royal Stickers\nto us...\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x04\x02\0And it was paid for with the power of\nall of you, who wished so fervently for\nSticker Fest to return.
before_staffroll_lucie_01	{d}{s[150]}WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!{s[100]}{/d}
before_staffroll_lucie_01_2	Please tell me you aren't trying to \ntouch the Sticker Comet again! 
before_staffroll_lucie_01_3	You know what I think? I think you're a\ntroublemaker! And your troublemaking\nmade trouble for everyone!
before_staffroll_lucie_02	Hmm... Being brought back to life by\nMario's wish was definitely nice, but...\x0e\0\x04\0If it's like this every year at the \nSticker Fest, I may have to seriously\nreconsider my career path.
revival_pre_center	WAAAAAA! The Sticker Fest grounds\nare a shambles!
revival_lv0_center	There's no sign left of how fun that\nSticker Fest was...
revival_lv1_center	The Sticker Fest?\x0e\0\x04\0That was but a dream. Forget about it.
revival_lv1_material	From this vantage point... No, there's \nstill nothing left...
revival_lv2_center	A Sticker Fest revival?\x0e\0\x04\0No, that's... That'll never happen.
revival_lv2_material	Toads are getting wind of the possibility\nof a Sticker Fest revival. Yeah...\nThey've started arriving.
revival_lv2_stage	It's easy to lose faith, but you can't!\nYou just have to get on with things. 
revival_lv2_benchi	I came here to see what was going on,\nbut I got so tired for some reason...
revival_lv2_field	I swung by to ask if there really might\nbe a Sticker Fest revival. Will there?
revival_lv2_hasamare	I, uh...got sandwiched in here.
revival_lv3_center	That's what I've been saying!\nA Sticker Fest revival is impossible...
revival_lv3_center_2	What?!\x0e\0\x04\0Wow! Everyone's pitching in!
revival_lv3_center_3	Mario! My eyes have been opened!\nNo more crying!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm going to work my darnedest to \nrevive Sticker Fest too!
revival_lv3_center_4	During downtime, I'm running to burn off\nall this excess motivation.
revival_lv3_tower_0	The bottom guy takes the most weight! \nLife stinks for bottom guy.
revival_lv3_tower_1	I'm second from the bottom! All the\nweight, none of the prestige of being\nbottom guy! Second-from-bottom guy\ngets no respect!
revival_lv3_tower_2	It's hard to balance when you're in \nthe middle! Middle guy has it rough!
revival_lv3_tower_3	Second-from-top guy probably has it\npretty easy.
revival_lv3_tower_4	The guy at the top is the highest!\nTop guy has to look fear in the eye!
revival_lv3_tower_5	All right, already. Pass it up here.
revival_lv3_yatai	Of course, every festival needs a kiosk.\nDuh.
revival_lv3_stagesode	Mario! Whoa! You've already got three\nRoyal Stickers?!\x0e\0\x04\0That pumps me UP! Yeah! Yeah!\nI'm gonna revive this festival!
revival_lv3_benchi	We could probably use a fence here.
revival_lv4_benchi	I ran too much and got tired, so I'm \ntaking a quick break.\x0e\0\x04\0But I'm still motivated! Honest!
revival_lv4_yatai_upper	Everyone's doing their part, huh?\nI'll do my part too.
revival_lv4_yatai_around	There's so much to do! I don't know\nwhere to start!
revival_lv4_push	As you can see, my hands are full.
revival_lv4_kamite	We're still setting up the stage.\nNo peeking!
revival_lv4_lighting	The light should be a little more over\nthere, I'm thinking.
revival_lv4_ladder_0	Hey, WHOA! Whoa. You should NEVER\njump on the top of a ladder.
revival_lv4_porttown	I heard a rumor about a Sticker Fest\nrevival, so I showed up. What do I do?\nWhere can I help out?
revival_lv4_stay_1	I'm so excited about the Sticker Fest,\nI can't sleep at night. So as a result,\nI'm totally sleepy during the day.
revival_lv4_walk_1	Huh? What was I hurrying for again?
revival_lv4_walk_2	There's so much to do. It's a little\nexhausting...but still so fun!
revival_lv4_walk_3	Four Royal Stickers! Yowza!\nI just leveled up...with excitement!
revival_lv5_dancer_0	Five! Six! Seven! Eight! One more time!
revival_lv5_dancer_1	Comet! Comet! Comet!\nFrom the niiiiiiiiight skyyyyy!
revival_lv5_dancer_2	We're doing the Comet Dance as a\nsideshow at the festival. Just getting a\nlittle practice in.
revival_lv5_dancer_3	Do it like you're the Sticker Comet!\nFrom the niiiiight sky! Yeah!
revival_lv5_stage	Yes, this is where Princess Peach will\nbe standing.
revival_lv5_lighting	The angle of the light is perfect!
revival_lv5_shopman_0	Now, try it with a smile! "Welcome!"
revival_lv5_shopman_1	Welcome!
revival_lv5_captain	It's Captain Mario! How do you fare?\nMe, I simply HAD to join the Sticker Fest\nrevival! HAD to!
revival_lv5_world	The world is vast. To think, there are \nthis many passionate Toads in it...\nMy horizons have expanded yet again.
revival_lv5_kinoD	I quit my job as the barker for the \nSticker Shop!
revival_lv5_stay_0	If you try hard, you can do anything.\nIt's so great that we didn't give up!
revival_lv5_stay_1	YAYYYYYYYYY! I'm so excited for the \nSticker Fest.
revival_lv5_stay_2	Whoa... Sticker Fest makes my heart go\nthump-thump-a-chicka-bow-bow.
revival_lv5_stay_3	Thanks to our efforts, look at how far\nthe festival revival has come!
revival_lv5_stay_4	Mario, just a little further to go! \nGood luck with that last Royal Sticker.
revival_lv5_stay_5	This spot's got the best view of the \nstage. The early bird gets the worm!
revival_lv5_stay_6	I hear that on the day of the festival, \nthis bench will be reserved for honored\nguests who have come from far away.
revival_lv5_stay_7	I can't sit still anymore!
pennant_kino_00	Hello there, Mario.\x0e\0\x04\0I hope you don't think this is weird,\nbut I put up some super flags around the\nfestival grounds to honor your many\nimpressive feats.\x0e\0\x04\0If you check out each flag, you can see\neach feat I've been tracking and gauge\nhow far along you've come.\x0e\0\x04\0There are eight super flags in all. \nLet's decorate this place in grand \nstyle, what do you say?!\x0e\0\x04\0You've gotta help pump this revival up\nto the MAX!
pennant_kino_01	Let's put up lots of super flags! Yeah!\nLet's really put the "viva" in the Sticker\nFest revival!
pennant_kino_02	Hey, Mario. I can see from your face\nthat you know all about the parade at\nthe end of Sticker Fest.\x0e\0\x04\0I wanted to keep it a surprise so I could\nfire everyone up, but if the sticker's out\nof the bag...\x0e\0\x04\0What do you say? You want to watch \nthe parade?\x0e\x03\0(\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0\x1e\0p\0e\0n\0n\0a\0n\0t\0_\0k\0i\0n\0o\0_\0y\0n\0
pennant_kino_yn	Yes!\nLater.
pennant_kino_yes	Of course you do! Who wouldn't?!\nLet me save your progress, OK?
pennant_kino_yes_2	All done! Enjoy the parade!
pennant_kino_no	Got it. I'll touch base with you later on.\nSee ya!

kinoE_talk_01	Dude, hello? I'm hiding.
kinoE_talk_02	Notice all the Goombas near town?\nWord is, they somehow made it over the\nmountains from the big Goomba fortress.\x0e\0\x04\0Ever since all that craziness went down\nat the Sticker Fest, they've been just\nwhaling on random passersby. I am NOT\nmaking eye contact with those dudes.
kinoF_talk_01	I'd love to set you up with some sweet \nstickers so you can live life to the \nfullest, but I don't have any in yet.
kinoF_talk_02	Hey, I finally got some sweet, life-\nfulfilling stickers in--pretty rare ones!
kinoF_talk_03	How about \x0e\x03\x02\x08\0\0\x04\0%\0d\0 coins? \x0e\x03\0*\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0 \0k\0i\0n\0o\0F\0_\0t\0a\0l\0k\0_\00\03\0_\0y\0n\0
kinoF_talk_03_yn	Pay.\nDon't pay.
kinoF_talk_03_no	Really? Then how about \x0e\x03\x02\x08\0\0\x04\0%\0d\0 coins? \x0e\x03\0*\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0 \0k\0i\0n\0o\0F\0_\0t\0a\0l\0k\0_\00\03\0_\0y\0n\0
kinoF_talk_03_no_last	Hmmmm, you drive a hard bargain. \nWell then, can you do \x0e\x03\x02\x08\0\0\x04\0%\0d\0 coins?\nJust so you know, I'm reaching my limit.\x0e\x03\0*\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0 \0k\0i\0n\0o\0F\0_\0t\0a\0l\0k\0_\00\03\0_\0y\0n\0
kinoF_talk_03_no_light	Whaaat? Are you serious? Gee whiz. \nOK then. Let's say \x0e\x03\x02\x08\0\0\x04\0%\0d\0 coins?\x0e\x03\0*\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0 \0k\0i\0n\0o\0F\0_\0t\0a\0l\0k\0_\00\03\0_\0y\0n\0
kinoF_talk_03_tarinai	You don't even have enough coins...\nSo what would you say to \x0e\x03\x02\x08\0\0\x04\0%\0d\0 coins? \x0e\x03\0*\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0 \0k\0i\0n\0o\0F\0_\0t\0a\0l\0k\0_\00\03\0_\0y\0n\0
kinoF_talk_03_tarinai_last	Hmmmm, you're really light on funds.\nHow about this: \x0e\x03\x02\x08\0\0\x04\0%\0d\0 coins?\nI'm about out of wiggle room, here.\x0e\x03\0*\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0 \0k\0i\0n\0o\0F\0_\0t\0a\0l\0k\0_\00\03\0_\0y\0n\0
kinoF_talk_03_tarinai_light	Hurmm... You don't have the cash.\nLook, let's say \x0e\x03\x02\x08\0\0\x04\0%\0d\0 coins. Deal?\x0e\x03\0*\0\0\xff\xff\0\0d\0 \0k\0i\0n\0o\0F\0_\0t\0a\0l\0k\0_\00\03\0_\0y\0n\0
kinoF_talk_03_harau	OK! Thank you very much!\x0e\0\x04\0Here you go, and have a great day!
kinoF_talk_03_no_end	No. Just no! I'm not dropping any more!\nI like to bargain, but you're just crazy!\nThis deal is a no go!
kinoF_talk_04	Oh, wait, looks like you don't have \nenough coins. Maybe you'd better just\nforget everything I said.
kinoG_talk_01	That red house near the fountain is \nalways locked. I don't mind telling you, \nit kinda creeps me out.\x0e\0\x04\0I'd bet you coins to cupcakes that \nsomeone's up to some funny business in\nthat place. And not "teehee" funny.\nMore like "bwahaha" funny.
kinoG_talk_02	Check it out: I managed to sneak a peek\ninside that house next to the Sticker\nShop...but there was nothing in there\nbut some stairs.\x0e\0\x04\0Really, really creepy.
kinoG_talk_03	Check it: if you go to the bottom of the\nstairs in that red house next to the\nSticker Shop, you can hear the sound\nof stickers being stuck up.\x0e\0\x04\0Totally, completely creepy.
kinoH_talk_01	There's an old tale that claims there's\na magic treasure sleeping inside the\nYoshi Sphinx. Supposedly this thing\nlights the darkness or something.\x0e\0\x04\0I don't buy it. I mean, c'mon, with the\ndarkness all lit up, nobody could sleep,\nlet alone some old treasure.
kinoH_talk_02	I've heard an old tale that claims a \nsacred staff sleeps within the \nSandshifter Ruins.\x0e\0\x04\0But it's a staff, right? So I guess it must\nsleep standing up. Seems uncomfy.
kinoJ_talk_01	HIIIIIIGH WIIIIIIIIND WAAAAAAAARNING!\nExtreme winds in the forecast for\nBouquet Gardens!
kinoJ_talk_02	ANOTHER HIIIGH WIIIIIND WAAAARNING!\nExtreme winds are once again in the\nforecast for Bouquet Gardens!\x0e\0\x04\0They stopped for a time, but now\nthey're blowing up a storm again.\nThe question is, why?
kara_kino_friend_01	Oh, I don't live here! I'm just watching\nthe house while my bud's off on a trip.\nIt's his house.
kara_kino_friend_02	I hope he's OK. I wonder where he is \nright now...
kara_kino_friend_03	You know my bud who's always off\ntraveling? I got a postcard from him!\nI put it up over there.
kara_kino_friend_04	Sounds like my bud's doing just fine. \nTraveling sounds AMAZING.
kara_kino_friend_05	WHOOOAAA! Talk about an awakening!\nFor a Toad to embrace his calling like\nthat... It's making me get all misty!\nI salute you, bud! BAWWWW!
kara_kino_friend_06	Hmph!\x0e\0\x04\0Y'know what? I KNOW you're gonna\nsave Princess Peach! It's a done deal.\x0e\0\x04\0And then, when the two of you return\nto the kingdom in TOTAL TRIUMPH, it is\nmy Toadly duty to welcome you back\nwith a smile and a vigorous back pat!\x0e\0\x04\0Like my bud, I've finally discovered \nmy calling in life! I feel complete!
kara_pict_01	Dear Bud,\nMy journey is fraught with danger.\x0e\0\x04\0I was lately accosted by some flimsy\nGoombas bent on mischief, but I\ndispatched them with ease.\x0e\0\x04\0They cried, "Forgive us, mighty Toad!" \nand left me 20 coins. Satisfactory!\nPray tell, what is better than a coin\nwell earned with knuckles? Naught!\x0e\0\x04\0In any case, my journey continues.\nWill write when circumstances permit.
kara_pict_02	Dear Bud,\nIn the unrelenting heat of the desert,\ntensions mount and the spirit quails.\nYet this Toad presses on! Huzzah!\x0e\0\x04\0The comforting strums of guitars seem\nomnipresent, a pleasing backdrop to the\nshimmering vistas of both pyramid and\nsphinx. All melts into a mirage dream.\x0e\0\x04\0As I trod the sands, I treated some\nlocal children to a cold beverage. \nHow lovely such chance meetings are!\nWe are all strangers in a strange world!\x0e\0\x04\0Much as I would love to linger here,\nI must journey on. Until I write again...
kara_pict_03	Dear Bud,\nMy ears, once clogged with the words of\nmen, now hear all. If one listens closely,\none can hear the voice of the woods.\x0e\0\x04\0I had tired of the hubbub of town life.\nI had come to wonder, what is a Toad?\nAnd so I embarked on this epic journey.\nYes, a journey to find myself.\x0e\0\x04\0I've come to realize that a Toad must\nlearn his limits. He must dispose of his\nworldly desires. And most of all, he must\nbe content with his inner Toad.\x0e\0\x04\0My inner Toad is more than content.\nHe is mighty. Poison surrounds me, but I\nfear not its acid bite. I shall donate my\nShiny Mushroom sticker to one in need.\x0e\0\x04\0My great journey of self-discovery \ncontinues. I will write soon.
kara_pict_04	Dear Bud,\nMy body, this crude vessel, is so cold...\nbut my spirit is ablaze.\x0e\0\x04\0So many attractions command my eye.\nSuch a wealth of entertainment calls to\nme that I quite lose track of time.\x0e\0\x04\0The tickets are rather on the expensive\nside, but the visions I have witnessed\nare worth any price.\x0e\0\x04\0I cannot tarry, however. A land of pure,\nuntamed wilderness lies ahead of me.\nPray tell, what chance encounters\nlie in wait for me there?\x0e\0\x04\0The mountains rise up to greet me as I\nset out on the next leg of my journey. \nUntil next time.
kara_pict_05	Dear Bud...\x0e\0\x04\0Confession time: I've been getting\nwhupped up and down two continents,\nand I've been saved time and again by\na fellow traveler.\x0e\0\x04\0Those whuppings opened my eyes, bud.\x0e\0\x04\0And I know now my mission in life. \nI've got to do my part to help Princess\nPeach! She needs us all to try our best!\x0e\0\x04\0I have no idea if I'll make it back in time\nto help revive the Sticker Fest, but I'll \ntry my darnedest! I'll make the princess\nproud if it's the last thing I do!\x0e\0\x04\0Until then, I remain your bud.
join_kinopio_return_house_00	Mario! I've been waiting for you.\x0e\0\x04\0As far as thank-you presents go, this is\nnothing special...but please take it!
join_kinopio_return_house_01	Hey, but speaking of which, when I was\nall lost in thought and then got lost...\x0e\0\x04\0The Goombas in front of that windmill\nkept repeating "Forwon toothree!\nForwon toothree!" Isn't that weird?\nI mean, what language is that?\x0e\0\x04\0...Whoa! I almost did it again!\nI've gotta stop getting lost in thought\nbefore I get REALLY lost again.
join_kinopio_return_house_02	What kind of crazy Goomba goes around\nmuttering "Forwon toothree"?\x0e\0\x04\0For won...two...three? I can't afford to\nget lost again, so I'm going to think\nabout it here inside the house.
join_kinopio_return_house_03	Ah, Mario! I was deep in thought again,\nas usual, when it suddenly hit me! \nMaybe that phrase has something to do\nwith that windmill!\x0e\0\x04\0That is some MENTAL FLEXING. \nThat is some INSIGHT. And all in a flash\nfrom out of the blue... Maybe I'm some\nkind of genius!

kinoD__standby__01	A little free advice: when you're looking\nfor something or someone, search every\nnook and cranny, OK?\x0e\0\x04\0Because whoever you're looking for is\nprobably alone in the shadows, sad and\nlonely, possibly crying, a little hungry, \nand generally just not having fun. 
kinoE__peel _A_01	Whenever the wind blew, I was flapping\naround up there like a piece of laundry!\nNot my finest moment.\x0e\0\x04\0And I've gotta say, dangling that high\nup really was kind of terrifying.\nLaundry's got it rough.
kinoE__standby__01	Now that I think on it, when I was up\nthere flapping in the breeze...\nIt was kinda fun.
kinoF__peel _A_01	Crumpled and stuck on a box... A BOX. \nI mean, I was raised to always keep my\ncreases crisp, but stuff like this really\ncrimps my corners...

rucy_talk_02	Look--a road! NOW we can start making\nsome progress. Hurry up, and let's find\nthe way out of town.
kinoG__peel _02	Wow, you've got the skills! You peeled\nit off without ripping my head!
kinoG__standby__01	I've gotta say, I'll never get used to\nthe sting that comes with the peeling\nprocess. Stickers are so sticky!

rucy_seal_first_4	That's right--those things are precious!\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, I know! I'll give you an album where\nyou can keep the stickers you've found\nsince me.

rucy_talk_03	Hmm. So this is the town proper...\nQuieter than I thought it would be.\nWell, whatever... Where's that exit?
rucy_talk_04	Hey, listen, saving people is noble and\nall, but how about you focus on getting\nus out of town first?

kino_house_back_03	I'm gonna live life to the fullest!\nMario, you should too!
kino_closet_01	Check this out: after Bowser stacked\nus, he carefully lined up our edges \nbefore stuffing us into the cabinet. \x0e\0\x04\0The guy is surprisingly meticulous. \nPretty impressive attention to detail\nfor a rampaging monster!
kino_dustbox_01	Crumpled, balled up, then flicked into\nthe trash without a second thought... \x0e\0\x04\0Pretty much the peak of humiliation for\npaper. I'm going to go grab a shower\nand forget this ever happened...
kino_pictframe_A01	Oh. Hey. I thought I hid pretty well,\nbut you found me easily, didn't you?\nHeh heh.\x0e\0\x04\0Wait. Who's on the what, now? \nBowser's gone? YESSSS, DUDES! \nLet's go home!
hum_tuto_00	Who... Who's that? There's...\nThere's no one here.
hum_tuto_01	Yo, Mario, you're blowing my cover. \nI'm waiting to ambush Bowser.\x0e\0\x04\0C'mere, Mr. Big Bowser Guy. \n"King of the Koopas"? Don't make me\nchortle. Vengeance will be MINE!

kino_leader_00	Oh wow! This place is really rolled up\ntight! That what's-his-Bowser guy\ndid quite a number on the town.
kino_leader_01	Aw, wouldja lookit this? What a pickle! \nPlaza's all rolled up like a burrito.\nCan't get out of town 'cause of this\nfine how-do-you-do, no, sir.\x0e\0\x04\0I ain't gonna lie to you--this looks bad.\nBut maybe if we get all the Toads in\ntown to help, we can de-burrito it.\x0e\0\x04\0Mario, the town Toads are probably\nall over the place after that Sticker\nFest carnage, so track 'em all down\nand see if they can help!
kino_leader_01_01	What?! Did he just say that the way\nout of town is through this plaza?\nOK, we need to get this place back to\nnormal, fast. \x0e\0\x04\0Mario, I say we round up those Toads!\nLet's get hunting!
kino_leader_02	Ain't this just a big ol' foofaraw?\nPlaza's all burritoed up, and we can't\nget out of town.\x0e\0\x04\0But I'll tell you, Mario...if all the Toads\nin town worked together, we might just\nwin the day.
kino_leader_04_pre	Good deal! Thanks to you, we got all\nthe Toads together!\x0e\0\x04\0That's our Mario--a Toad-saving pro! \nNow, let's get to it!
kino_leader_04	OK. Ready to un-burrito this bad boy?
kino_leader_05	{d}PUSH!{/d}
kino_leader_06	{d}PUUUUUUUUUUUUSH!{/d}
kino_leader_07	Wooooo-HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\nWe did it! Thanks, Mario!\x0e\0\x04\0The plaza's back to normal, so now we\ncan leave town!\x0e\0\x04\0You've probably got some Princess\nPeach saving to do, huh? Go to it!
kino_leader_08	We still ain't got enough Toadpower...\nGotta have all the Toads in town.\x0e\0\x04\0Mario, hook us up!
kino_leader_09	Looks like about half the Toads in town,\nbut it ain't near enough.\x0e\0\x04\0Keep it up! Find those Toads!
kino_leader_10	We got almost all the Toads. Just a\ncouple of stragglers, I'm thinking.\x0e\0\x04\0Ain't that many nooks and crannies in\ntown... Search 'em all! Find those last\nleftover Toads!
kino_wating_hint_01	So there's nobody left on the Sticker\nFest grounds?
kino_wating_hint_02	There's no one left on the Sticker Fest\ngrounds? You sure?\x0e\0\x04\0They might not all be out in the open.\nLook in the shadows, behind stuff,\nabove stuff...near stuff. Stuff.
kino_wating_hint_03	A Toad's gotta wonder if you've found\neveryone on the Sticker Fest grounds...
kino_wating_hint_04	I can't shake the feeling that there\nmight still be someone on the Sticker\nFest grounds...
kino_wating_hint_14	My Toadly intuition says you haven't\nfound everyone on the Sticker Fest\ngrounds yet...
kino_wating_hint_15	How's that hammer holding up? \nDid you know you can knock down\nbushes and stuff with it?
kino_wating_hint_16	As a general rule, be careful about\ntossing crumpled-up paper in the trash.\nIt might be a Toad!
kino_wating_hint_06	You oughta search every nook and\ncranny of the houses. Some Toads\nmight be stashed somewhere.
kino_wating_hint_07	How's that hammer treating you?\nEver knock down any shrubs with it?\nSeems like a fun way to spend an\nafternoon.
kino_wating_hint_08	Don't overlook any little detail. \nAll the way to the very edge of town,\nmake sure your eyes are razor sharp!\x0e\0\x04\0You never know... There might be Toads\ntrying as hard as they can to get your\nattention.
kino_wating_hint_10	Word is some Toads found a perfect\nhiding place when Bowser went nuts.\nCheck it out: they hid inside a painting!\nLike they were painted in a painting!
kino_wating_hint_11	How's your relationship with that \nhammer? You guys buds? Well, ask your\nbud if he's ever flipped anything over\nby whacking the ground.
kino_wating_hint_12	Somebody said they heard Bowser yell\nsomething about "going out back" as\nhe dragged a Toad off...\x0e\0\x04\0Why would he want to hide a Toad\nin some secluded spot? I tell you, \nBowser sure is scary!
town_square.msbt
sealshop_npc_05	I really don't know what's up with that \nsticker shop set up out back of town...\nSeems pretty shady, if you ask me.\x0e\0\x04\0Rest assured, MY stickers are the \ngenuine, 100% real deal! Guaranteed to\nhave fallen from the Sticker Comet! 
sealshop_npc_03	Hmm... So those are the current coin\nrates for buying stickers, huh?\x0e\0\x04\0I wonder what I'd fetch... I'm way too\nshiny to go for cheap!
shop_kino_04	Stickers... Apparently those who can't\nfind 'em make 'em! That's what the \nword on the street is, anyway.\x0e\0\x04\0But no homemade stickers here, no!\nMy stickers are the real deal, freshly\nfallen from the Sticker Comet!\x0e\0\x04\0So, welcome! Welcome to Toad's Official\nSticker Shop!
shop_kino_05	Welcome to Toad's Official Sticker Shop!
tutorial_start_event_00	{d}HOLD UP OVER THERE!{/d}
tutorial_start_event_01	Heh... Where ya headed, Mario? \nWhy don'tcha play with us for a while?
tutorial_start_event_02	Excuse me! What are you thinking,\nyou flimsy, little ingrates? \nYou are IN THE WAY. \x0e\0\x04\0But that's fine, because it'll give us a\nchance to use some sticker power\nand turn you into paper scraps. \nPrepare to be shredded!
tutorial_start_event_03	OK, they're all yours, Mario. \nI'm far too delicate a lady for a\nbrouhaha. Protecting me is your duty!
tutorial_start_event_04	So you think we're flimsy, huh?\nAnd you're going to "shred" us, huh?\nWell, we'll just see about that!
tutorial_event_battle_00	Heh heh! Yeah, we aren't the same old\nGoombas you're used to stomping, pal!\x0e\0\x04\0Bowser's got our backs!
tutorial_event_battle_01	Huh? Well, this is unexpected...\nThey looked like the usual little\nstompable minions, but...\x0e\0\x04\0I'm sensing...sticker power!
tutorial_event_battle_01_2	Well, we've got sticker power too!\nMario, pull out your stickers!
tutorial_event_battle_02	...WHAT?! You don't have ANY?!\nWhy didn't you say so?!\x0e\0\x04\0Oh well, too late to collect any now. \nHere. As a special favor, you can have\nsome of mine.
tutorial_event_battle_03	That's all you've got? Mmmmm.\nNope, might not be enough. Here. As a\nspecial favor, have some of mine.
tutorial_event_battle_04	Mario got stickers from Kersti!
tutorial_event_battle_05	OK, first, look over here!\x0e\0\x04\0Choose the sticker you want to use,\nand stick it right here!
tutorial_event_battle_06	On the bottom screen, touch the \nsticker you want to use, or just use \n\x0e\x02\x02\x16\x0c\0m\0i\0c\0_\0s\0t\0\x12\0\x05\0\x18\0\x18\0 to line up the cursor and confirm\nwith \x0e\x02\x02\x14\n\0m\0i\0c\0_\0a\0\x12\0\x05\0\x18\0\x18\0.\x0e\0\x04\0Now...let the sticker battle BEGIN!
tutorial_event_battle_after_attack	Nice! Keep it up!
tutorial_event_battle_hp_low	You're kinda getting whupped... \nIf your HP hits 0, the game is over!\nBe careful!
tutorial_event_battle_use_kinoko	That sticker makes you feel better by\nrestoring your HP. Use it as needed!
tutorial_event_battle_after_event_00	He shredded us! We really ARE flimsy!
tutorial_event_battle_after_event_01	Phew... There was definitely something\noff about those Goombas. I'm sure their\nbehavior has something to do with the\nRoyal Stickers getting scattered.\x0e\0\x04\0With sketchy Goombas all over, it might\nbe a good idea to prepare for the worst\nby buying stickers from the town's \nsticker shop.\x0e\0\x04\0But that's your call. Now, let's go find\nthe Royal Stickers!
lucie_after_roll	We did it! Now we can take that exit\nto get outside of town.\x0e\0\x04\0Finally, we can set out to find the\nRoyal Stickers! FINALLY!\x0e\0\x04\0Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention...\nIf you ever want to talk to me, just\npress \x0e\x02\x02\x14\n\0m\0i\0c\0_\0l\0\x12\0\x05\0\x18\0\x18\0.\x0e\0\x04\0If you get stuck, or lost, or maybe just \nlonely, I might be able to give you a\nlittle advice.
join_kinopio_return_town_00	You did it! You got me back to town!\nOh, thank you so much. I'm almost \ncrying with joy!\x0e\0\x04\0I've got a little something to thank you\nwith, so come by my house.\x0e\0\x04\0It's the middle house in the group of\nthree up ahead. I'll wait for you there!
kino_leader_12	{d}{s[075]}...Un-burritoing is dangerous...{s[100]}{/d}\x0e\0\x04\0{d}{s[075]}...Thanks for the help...{s[100]}{/d}
kinoA_talk_01	So a bunch of Toads went off together\nto go sticker hunting on the Warm\nFuzzy Plains... \x0e\0\x04\0I'm sure you know this, but picking up\nfallen stickers during this season is\nbasically the leisure activity of choice.
kinoA_talk_02	Have you ever seen the famous\nwaterfall on Water's Edge Way?\x0e\0\x04\0This one Toad just headed out that way\nfor a solo stroll... He's probably going\nto check it out.
kinoA_talk_03	That Toad who went for a walk on \nWater's Edge Way hasn't come back...\x0e\0\x04\0I'm just picturing him gazing in wonder\nat the waterfall and then losing his\nfooting and falling into it or something.\nI hope he's OK!
kinoB_talk_01	{s[075]}{d}"Help"?{/d}\x0e\0\x04\0{s[100]}Nah, I'm hearing things. All in my head.\nResisting the urge to freak out.
kinoB_talk_02	The fountain's gone! I'm freaking out!
kinoB_talk_03	Fountain's back! I'm not freaking out!
kinoC_talk_01	Bowser really went off on the Sticker\nFest grounds, and now looking at them\nis almost too much to bear.\x0e\0\x04\0You could probably bear it, though.\nYou look like you can bear a thing or\ntwo. The grounds are that-a-way.
kinoC_talk_02	I helped out on the cleanup of the \nruined Sticker Fest grounds, and it was\nreally depressing. I mean, it looked like\nsome kind of sticky wasteland.\x0e\0\x04\0I was so bummed, I tried decorating\nthe grounds with stickers, but...
kinoC_talk_03	I hope the Sticker Fest will open again.\nIs that crazy? I guess that's crazy.\x0e\0\x04\0I don't care. I'm putting up stickers to\nmaybe make it look like there's a \nchance, but I have a LONG way to go.
kinoC_talk_04	If you keep your ears open, you'll hear\npeople starting to raise a stink about\nSticker Fest reopening.\x0e\0\x04\0But it's just not that simple, is it?
kinoC_talk_05	Did you see the Sticker Fest grounds?!\nOh my GOODNESS!
kinoC_talk_06	Not a single Toad in the kingdom doubts\nthat Sticker Fest will reopen!\x0e\0\x04\0That includes me, of course!
kinoC_talk_07	It's happening! The festival is \nreopening at last!\x0e\0\x04\0{d}STICKER FEST FOR LIFE!{/d}
kinoD_talk_01	You know what would make a great \nsouvenir of your time in Decalburg?\nA sticker!\x0e\0\x04\0I mean, Bowser DID kind of rampage all\nover the place, and so we DON'T really\nhave much variety in our inventory, but\nthe plan is to get more stock soon.\x0e\0\x04\0Anyway, go ahead and have a look \naround the shop. You won't regret it!
kinoD_talk_02	Y'know what? I bet the sticker shop on\nWhammino Mountain would also \nappreciate your patronage.
kinoD_talk_03	I'd be remiss if I didn't put a plug in for\nthe sticker shop at Outlook Point...\nGreat place to do some purchasing!
kinoD_talk_04	Here's a hot tip: the sticker shop at\nRumble Volcano could use your business.
kinoD_talk_05	The best Decalburg souvenirs are\nstickers... Have a look around the shop!
kinoD_talk_06	The shop got in some new stickers!\nYou should check 'em out.
kinoD_talk_07	It's true! I swear it! I saw a moving \nshadow in the sky out over the forest!\x0e\0\x04\0And it wasn't small, like a Paratroopa\nor a Paragoomba! It was BIG!
kinoD_talk_08	It's true! I swear it! This time I saw \nsomething flying out toward Gate Cliff!\nI am NOT kidding!\x0e\0\x04\0And what's more, I'm POSITIVE there\nwas something clinging to its head!
kinoI_talk_01	So a new shop opened over there, \nright? And it looks like super fun! 
kinoI_talk_02	So at that new shop over there, you\ncan make your own stickers, right?\nSuper fun!\x0e\0\x04\0But I don't have any of these "things"\nyou need, so I can't make any stickers.\nSuper bummer!
kinoI_talk_03	Mario, you've got some super-cool\nthings, right?\x0e\0\x04\0Like, I heard you got some amazing \nthing in Bouquet Gardens, or something.\x0e\0\x04\0So if you turn that thing into a sticker?\nIt'll be even more super cool. 
kinoI_talk_04	Wow, you've got a fan sticker, right?\nSuper cool! And you're a sticker fan!\nSuper mind blowing!
kinoI_talk_05	I'd like to make my own stickers too, \nright? But I don't have any "things." \nTalk about a super bummer!\x0e\0\x04\0I wish there was some guy somewhere\nthat would hook me up with a few\nspecial things for some coins...
kinoI_talk_06	...Too expensive for me. I mean, I can't\nafford that, right? Super lame. 
door_01_locked	It won't open. Looks like it's locked.
kinoK_talk_01	Welcome back, Mario! Great job being all\nepic on that epic journey!\x0e\0\x04\0Huh? You don't have Princess Peach \nyet? What's wrong with you?

hana_Search01A_3_5_08	Hey! The Wiggler segment ran away!\x0e\0\x04\0Ugh! Well, this is pretty annoying.\nWe'd better go catch it.
hana_Search01B_3_2_06	Phew... I'm glad that's over with.\nC'mon, little guy. Back to your house.
hana_Search04C_1_3_05	Let's take the Wiggler segment back to\nits tree house.
jr._battle_appear_02	HEY! Running away? REALLY?!\x0e\0\x04\0Mario's not stronger at all!\nTalk about lame!
jr._battle_appear_04	Dang! You're nothing but a big bully!\nI'm telling my dad on you!\x0e\0\x04\0And my dad is SOOOO shiny right now!\nHe's way, way stronger than the both\nof you combined!\x0e\0\x04\0{d}Better be ready to cry a lot!{/d}
