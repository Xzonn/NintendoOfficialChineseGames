Test_Results01_01_01	Well done!
Test_Results02_01_01	How was your first Test?
Test_Results02_01_02	Your Test results are reflected in your\n{color[ff1010ff]}Big Brain Brawn{color[000000ff]} score.
Test_Results02_01_03	The {color[ff1010ff]}higher your score{color[000000ff]}, the more\nimpressive your performance.
Test_Results02_01_04	You may be interested to know...
Test_Results02_01_05	my Big Brain Brawn score is around\n{color[ff1010ff]}3300{color[000000ff]}.
Test_Results02_01_06	An average person who hasn't spent\ntime in Practice will score around {color[ff1010ff]}1500{color[000000ff]}.
Test_Results02_01_06_02	And someone using Sprout Support\nusually scores around {color[ff1010ff]}250{color[000000ff]}.
Test_Results02_01_07	Well, yes, I suppose I am pretty\namazing then. *ahem*
Test_Results02_01_08	Without further ado, let's take a look at\nthe Test results.
Test_Results02_02_01	Now then, let's get right to those Test\nresults!
Test_Results03_01_01	Hmm... You didn't reach your\nHigh Score.
Test_Results03_01_02	Well, that's life for you, isn't it? Best to\nshake it off and keep moving forward!
Test_Results03_02_01	My, my! It seems there are plenty of\nareas that could use some stretching\nand flexing.
Test_Results03_03_01	Hmm... This is a score that calls for\nmore stretching and flexing.
Test_Results03_04_01	Well, well! This score suggests you've\nbeen stretching and flexing!
Test_Results03_05_01	Why, that's a fairly good score!
Test_Results03_06_01	Aha! This is a very good score indeed!
Test_Results03_07_01	Incredible! Your score is about the\nsame as mine!
Test_Results03_07_02	I must say, {[0100]}...\nYou're doing quite well.
Test_Results03_08_01	Wh-what's this?! Très magnifique!
Test_Results03_08_02	A Big Brain so brawny it has surpassed\neven my own!
Test_Results03_08_03	I...think I may need some time to come\nto grips with this development.
Test_Results03_09_01	*gasp* I...I cannot believe it!
Test_Results03_09_02	You've far exceeded even my own\nBig Brain Brawn!
Test_Results04_01_01	Now then, it's time to give you your\n{color[ff1010ff]}Brain Grade{color[000000ff]}!
Test_Results05_01_01	Congratulations!
Test_Results05_01_02	This is your {color[ff1010ff]}Brain Grade{color[000000ff]} for the time\nbeing.
Test_Results05_01_03	But you're just getting started. Let's\naim for ever higher heights together!
Test_Results05_02_01	Here's the {color[ff1010ff]}Brain Grade{color[000000ff]} you earned\nthis time.
Test_Results05_03_01	You did it! You earned a new {color[ff1010ff]}Brain Grade{color[000000ff]}!
Test_Results05_03_02	Your potential is boundless, you\nsee. On and up you go, to infinity!
Test_Results05_04_01	Oh! Oh my! It appears you've achieved\nthe grade of...of...{color[ff1010ff]}Mastermind{color[000000ff]}!
Test_Results05_04_02	A legendary grade indeed! It means you've\nreached the peak of Big Brain Brawniness!
Test_Results05_04_03	To think we have a {color[ff1010ff]}Mastermind{color[000000ff]} among\nour academy students... I'm so proud!
Test_Results05_05_01	You have already achieved a\nMastermind Brain Grade.
Test_Results05_05_02	Having a Mastermind in our midst...\nWhy, it's the pride of our academy!
Test_Results05_05_03	Please, continue to exercise and flex\nthat brain of yours as you continue on\nin your pursuit of a High Score!
Test_Results06_01_01	Now, let's take a closer look at the\nTest results.
Test_Results07_ZZ_01	Oh, hmm... Perhaps it's best to wait\nuntil you get the hang of Tests first.
Test_Results07_00_01	First, let me say, your results this time\nwere nicely balanced!
Test_Results07_00_02	Feel free to continue to strive for\nbalance. Or perhaps try to find a\ncategory you excel at.
Test_Results07_cmm	First things first...
Test_Results07_01_01	Your best category was {color[ff1010ff]}Identify{color[000000ff]}!
Test_Results07_01_02	Yes, it seems you have reliable instincts\nwhen under pressure.
Test_Results07_02_01	Your best category was {color[ff1010ff]}Memorize{color[000000ff]}!
Test_Results07_02_02	Have you considered memorizing all of your\nfriends' birthdays? You'd be quite popular!
Test_Results07_03_01	Your best category was {color[ff1010ff]}Analyze{color[000000ff]}!
Test_Results07_03_02	Adjust your perspective, and complicated\nthings can look quite simple, yes?
Test_Results07_04_01	Your best category was {color[ff1010ff]}Compute{color[000000ff]}!
Test_Results07_04_02	Being good with numbers can be\nuseful in numerous ways!
Test_Results07_05_01	Your best category was {color[ff1010ff]}Visualize{color[000000ff]}!
Test_Results07_05_02	It is important to accurately perceive\nthat which you see with your eyes!
Test_Results08_cmm	Furthermore...
Test_Results08_01_01	There's room for improvement in {color[ff1010ff]}Identify{color[000000ff]}.\nI recommend flexing and stretching there.
Test_Results08_02_01	There's room for improvement in {color[ff1010ff]}Memorize{color[000000ff]}.\nI recommend flexing and stretching there.
Test_Results08_03_01	There's room for improvement in {color[ff1010ff]}Analyze{color[000000ff]}.\nI recommend flexing and stretching there.
Test_Results08_04_01	There's room for improvement in {color[ff1010ff]}Compute{color[000000ff]}.\nI recommend flexing and stretching there.
Test_Results08_05_01	There's room for improvement in {color[ff1010ff]}Visualize{color[000000ff]}.\nI recommend flexing and stretching there.
Test_Results09_cmm	Also...
Test_Results09_01_01	Be sure to stay calm. You'll make fewer\nmistakes and get more correct answers!
Test_Results09_02_01	Try to answer as fast as you can!
Test_Results09_03_01	Stay calm and you'll make fewer\nmistakes. Then your Big Brain Brawn\nscore will increase!
Test_Results09_04_01	If you can answer a little faster, your\nBig Brain Brawn score should improve!
Test_Results09_05_01	The only advice I have for growing your\nBig Brain Brawn further is...focus on\nthe activities.
Test_Results09_05_02	Magnificent. Now let's continue trying\nour best to be the best!
Test_Results10_cmn	Lastly...
Test_Results10_01_01	Your Big Brain Brawn is sure to grow.
Test_Results10_01_02	Just be sure to try for a High Score in\nall kinds of different Practice activities!
Test_Results10_02_01	If an activity that you have difficulty with\nappears in a Test...
Test_Results10_02_02	♪Try to relax your brain and remain\ncalm—that's the game!♪
Test_Results10_03_01	I get the sense that, normally, you\nwould do a bit better.
Test_Results10_03_02	So make sure you're taking time to rest\nyour brain. It needs time to refresh too!
Test_Results10_04_01	I do believe your brain should be a bit\nbrawnier than this.
Test_Results10_04_02	At times like this, it can be good to\nrelax and enjoy doing nothing!
Test_Results10_05_01	That was a great Big Brain Brawn\nscore!
Test_Results10_05_02	Try doing a variety of Practice activities\nas you aim for an ever brawnier brain!
Test_Results10_06_01	If you continue on in Practice, you\nshould do even better! I believe in you!
Test_Results10_06_02	Keep trying for High Scores in both\nTest and Practice!
Test_Results10_07_01	I get the sense that you would normally\nscore a bit better.
Test_Results10_07_02	Be sure to rest your brain every once in\na while to refresh.
Test_Results10_08_01	If I may, I felt you were a bit off your\ngame this time.
Test_Results10_08_02	If you're tired, take time to rest up. Fear\nnot—I'll be right here waiting for you.
Test_Results10_09_01	Your brain brawniness was rather\nimpressive during this Test!
Test_Results10_09_02	With a brain that brawny, you'll be able\nto increase your Practice scores too!
Test_Results10_10_01	Your Big Brain Brawn score from this\nTest looks fairly good.
Test_Results10_10_02	At this rate, you might be able to earn\nnew medals in Practice!
Test_Results10_11_01	That was a good Big Brain Brawn score,\nbut I'm sure you can go even higher.
Test_Results10_11_02	Keep trying for High Scores in both\nTest and Practice!
Test_Results10_12_01	Your Practice scores suggest you have\nthe potential to score quite high.
Test_Results10_12_02	I'd like to see you put your brain's\ntrue brawniness on display during\nTests too!
Test_Results10_13_01	I confess, I am excited and a bit\nsurprised to come across a brain\nso brawny!
Test_Results10_13_02	I do hope you're trying to collect as\nmany Gold Lobe Medals as you can\nin Practice.
Test_Results10_14_01	Tell me, have you been collecting\nGold Lobe Medals in Practice?
Test_Results10_14_02	I have no doubt you're capable of\nacquiring a nice collection of them!
Test_Results10_15_01	You know, your brain is fairly brawny.
Test_Results10_15_02	If you spend time getting the hang of\nthe activities in Practice and Test, you'll\nsee your score rise even higher!
Test_Results10_16_01	The results this time seem to have done\na fairly good job capturing your true\nabilities.
Test_Results10_16_02	That is, your Big Brain Brawn score in\nPractice is quite impressive. And I'm\nsure you can do just as well in a Test!
Test_Results10_17_01	Looking at the Test results, I see you've\ngot quite the brawny brain on you.
Test_Results10_17_02	Just be sure you're stretching and\nflexing your brain over in Practice\nas well!
Test_Results10_18_01	Those Test results were wonderful.\nSuch potential!
Test_Results10_18_02	I do hope you'll stretch and flex your\nbrain over in Practice so you can aim\nfor even higher heights!
Test_Results10_19_01	You've achieved quite the Big Brain\nBrawn score in both Test and Practice.
Test_Results10_19_02	You can also try for higher grades and\nbetter Medals, or perhaps see how you\nfare in a Ghost Clash.
Test_Results10_20_01	You've achieved quite the Big Brain\nBrawn Test score. I'd say the time\nyou've spent in Practice is paying off.
Test_Results10_20_02	If you keep spending time in Practice,\nthere's no telling how high your\nBig Brain Brawn score could go!
Test_Results10_21_01	You earned quite the Big Brain Brawn\nscore during this Test...and yet, you've\nnot spent much time in Practice.
Test_Results10_21_02	Could it be... Is your brain just\nbrawny by nature?!
Test_Results10_21_03	Nevertheless, be sure to try your\nhand...er, brain...at as many Practice\nactivities as you can.
Test_Results10_21_04	After all, brain brawniness might not\nbe the only reward for collecting all\nthose Gold Lobe Medals...
Test_Results10_22_01	With the brawniness of your brain...
Test_Results10_22_02	I daresay you'll have no trouble\ncollecting lots of Gold Lobe Medals\nin Practice.
Test_Results10_22_03	Did you know, I make each medal by\nhand? It's true!
Test_Results10_23_01	Truly wonderful Test results!
Test_Results10_23_02	Your time spent in Practice has paid\noff handsomely, it seems.
Test_Results10_24_01	Your Test results and your Practice\nresults are truly marvelous!
Test_Results10_24_02	It must be said, you are everything\nI could hope for from a Big Brain\nAcademy student, {[0100]}.
Test_Results11_01_01	Well then...
Test_Results11_01_01_01	Now, it's time to announce your\n{color[ff1010ff]}Brain Type{color[000000ff]}, which is based on your\nBig Brain Brawn score!
Test_Results11_01_02	This is your Brain Type at this time.
Event_Birthday_01	What's this? If I'm not mistaken,\ntoday is...
Event_Birthday_02	your birthday! Happy birthday,\n{[0100]}!
Event_Birthday_03	I look forward to continuing this big,\nbrainy journey together...
Event_Birthday_04	for many more birthdays to come!
Event_Comp_Outfits_01	Ah, at last! You received the final outfit!

TitleGreet_01_01	*yawwwwwwn*
TitleGreet_01_02	A bright and early morning to you.
TitleGreet_02_01	Ah, good morning!
TitleGreet_03_01	Good day!
TitleGreet_04_01	Hello!
TitleGreet_05_01	Good evening!
TitleGreet_06_01	*phew*
TitleGreet_06_02	Good evening.
TitleTimeTalk_00_01	Hello there! How are we feeling today?
TitleTimeTalk_00_02	I'm doing quite well, thank you.
TitleTimeTalk_00_03	Well then! Shall we get started?
TitleTimeTalk_01_01	Welcome to a new day!
TitleTimeTalk_01_02	Let's make today a great one.
TitleTimeTalk_01_03	Well then! Let's get started, shall we?
TitleTimeTalk_02_01	My, you're up early. But if you're\nanything like me, you're at your\nsharpest in the morning.
TitleTimeTalk_02_02	Hey! Hello! Good morning!
TitleTimeTalk_02_03	I AM FEELING FANTASTIC!
TitleTimeTalk_02_04	Whew! Well, how about we get started?
TitleTimeTalk_03_01	My, you're up early. But if you're\nanything like me, you're at your\nsharpest in the morning.
TitleTimeTalk_03_02	Hey! Hello! Good morning!
TitleTimeTalk_03_03	Ow! Ow! Ow! M-my back! I must've\nslept funny...
TitleTimeTalk_03_04	Well...then—ow! Let's...g-get...started.
TitleTimeTalk_04_01	Mmm! I love the fresh scent of morning\nair. Don't you?
TitleTimeTalk_04_02	It's almost as refreshing as a sip of cool\nlemonade on a hot day... Delicious!
TitleTimeTalk_04_03	All right! Ready to get started?
TitleTimeTalk_05_01	And-a one, and-a two!\nAnd-a three, and-a four!
TitleTimeTalk_05_02	Phew! Huh? You look confused.
TitleTimeTalk_05_03	That was just my morning routine. It\nhelps me think a little better.
TitleTimeTalk_05_04	Well, with that out of the way...\nshall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_06_01	♪Lalalaa!♪ ♪Hmm hmm hmmmm!♪
TitleTimeTalk_06_02	Pardon me! I have one of the\nacademy's many catchy melodies\nstuck in my head.
TitleTimeTalk_06_03	I find them as relaxing as they are, er...\nimpossible to forget.
TitleTimeTalk_06_04	♪Shall we begin?♪
TitleTimeTalk_07_01	You may not know this, but I put quite\na bit of effort into my appearance.
TitleTimeTalk_07_02	Oh yes! My moustache alone takes an\nhour each day to get just right.
TitleTimeTalk_07_03	Please take a moment to admire it...and\nthen let's begin, shall we?
TitleTimeTalk_08_01	They say that back when the earth was\njust forming...
TitleTimeTalk_08_02	it rained nonstop for years.
TitleTimeTalk_08_03	Surprising, isn't it?
TitleTimeTalk_08_04	It's strange how the things we take\nfor granted, like sunny days...
TitleTimeTalk_08_05	just weren't normal at different periods\nin history.
TitleTimeTalk_08_06	Year after year of nonstop rain...
TitleTimeTalk_08_07	It's a wonder the wheel was invented\nbefore the electric clothes dryer!
TitleTimeTalk_08_08	Well, on that soggy thought...\nshall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_09_01	Have you ever wondered how your Big\nBrain Brawn stacks up against others?
TitleTimeTalk_09_02	I used to think my Big Brain Brawn was\nas...brawny...as it gets.
TitleTimeTalk_09_03	Then someone came along to show me\nhow wrong I was. It was...humbling.
TitleTimeTalk_09_04	I had never seen such a brawny brain!\nAnd no one else had either!
TitleTimeTalk_09_05	There is a Brain Grade prepared for\nthose kinds of brains.
TitleTimeTalk_09_06	Mastermind.
TitleTimeTalk_09_07	And that is the tale of the Mastermind,\nthe legendary Brain Grade.
TitleTimeTalk_09_08	Are we feeling ambitious today?\nThen let's begin.
TitleTimeTalk_10_01	Did you have lunch yet? I'm going to\neat after we're done.
TitleTimeTalk_10_02	 ♪La la laaaa...♪\nWhat shall I have?
TitleTimeTalk_10_03	Heh heh heh... I got lost for a moment\nthere. I suppose I'm pretty hungry.
TitleTimeTalk_10_04	Well, the sooner we begin, the sooner\nI get lunch. Shall we?
TitleTimeTalk_11_01	Have you had lunch yet? I have already\neaten, myself.
TitleTimeTalk_11_02	Which means that now I get to think\nabout my afternoon snack!
TitleTimeTalk_11_03	Well, I can circle back to that later.\nShall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_12_01	You know, I'm not very fond of the heat.
TitleTimeTalk_12_02	I never leave the academy. I don't know\nwhat I'd do without air conditioning.
TitleTimeTalk_12_03	And even when I'm in the academy, this\nsuit still makes me sweat...
TitleTimeTalk_12_04	Oh dear! You probably didn't want to\nknow that.
TitleTimeTalk_12_05	Well, let's move on. Quickly.\nShall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_13_01	Let's... Hello. Today we'll...
TitleTimeTalk_13_02	Brain...
TitleTimeTalk_13_03	...
TitleTimeTalk_13_04	...Huh?
TitleTimeTalk_13_05	I'm sorry. I believe I just nodded off.
TitleTimeTalk_13_06	Maybe if we begin, I'll wake up a bit\nmore. Shall we?
TitleTimeTalk_14_01	Do you ever feel sleepy after lunch?\nI know I do.
TitleTimeTalk_14_02	Here's a tip...
TitleTimeTalk_14_03	Start dancing as if nobody is watching!
TitleTimeTalk_14_04	Not only will the movement wake you\nup, but if done in public, the feeling of\nembarrassment might help too!
TitleTimeTalk_14_05	Alternatively, you could just make sure\nto get plenty of sleep every night.
TitleTimeTalk_14_06	Generally speaking, we at the Big Brain\nAcademy encourage everyone to make\nsure they get enough rest.
TitleTimeTalk_14_07	Well, if you're done dancing...\nshall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_15_01	I'm told I always seem knowledgeable\nabout whatever I'm speaking on.
TitleTimeTalk_15_02	It's quite flattering...
TitleTimeTalk_15_03	But honestly, the more I've learned, the\nmore I've become aware of how much I\nDON'T know.
TitleTimeTalk_15_03_02	I suppose that's the curse of a life\nspent learning. It's worth it though.
TitleTimeTalk_15_04	Well, now that you know that...\nshall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_16_01	They say that there are two kinds of\ncourage...
TitleTimeTalk_16_02	The courage to do, and the courage\nnot to.
TitleTimeTalk_16_03	I suppose everyone is confronted with\nthese tests of courage sooner or later.
TitleTimeTalk_16_04	For instance, right now I'm on a diet.
TitleTimeTalk_16_05	My courage "not to" is being tested\nquite often lately...
TitleTimeTalk_16_06	Just today, I had to find the courage\n"not to" get pudding with lunch.
TitleTimeTalk_16_07	Unfortunately, I didn't find that courage.\nBut at least the pudding was good.
TitleTimeTalk_16_08	Well, if you're feeling brave...\nshall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_17_01	The smell of a home-cooked meal\nfloating in the evening breeze...
TitleTimeTalk_17_02	That really takes me back...
TitleTimeTalk_17_03	I wonder how my mom is doing...
TitleTimeTalk_17_04	I should probably call her...
TitleTimeTalk_17_05	...Well, I can do that after we're done.\nShall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_19_01	I often get sentimental as the sun sets.
TitleTimeTalk_19_02	And quite hungry too!
TitleTimeTalk_19_03	Well, I can get a snack later.\nShall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_20_01	This feels really familiar...
TitleTimeTalk_20_02	Does that ever happen to you—a feeling\nthat you're repeating an experience?
TitleTimeTalk_20_03	That's called déjà vu.
TitleTimeTalk_20_04	Wait, I'm pretty sure I told you that\nbefore...
TitleTimeTalk_20_05	Well then! Shall we begin?\nAgain?
TitleTimeTalk_21_01	The day is almost over.
TitleTimeTalk_21_02	How was today for you?
TitleTimeTalk_21_03	Are you enjoying your time with\nBig Brain Academy?
TitleTimeTalk_21_04	...
TitleTimeTalk_21_04_02	Y-you are, right?
TitleTimeTalk_21_05	Well, I'm sure you'd tell me if you\nweren't. Shall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_22_01	Have you had dinner yet? I'm just about\nto, myself.
TitleTimeTalk_22_02	I'm going to have a great big omelet.\nI love how easy they are to make!
TitleTimeTalk_22_03	When you're a busy headmaster on the\ngo, easy recipes are the best ones.
TitleTimeTalk_22_04	Well, now my tummy is rumbling.\nShall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_23_01	Did you have dinner yet?
TitleTimeTalk_23_02	I think I might have eaten too much.
TitleTimeTalk_23_03	I feel so heavy right now.
TitleTimeTalk_23_04	Please, um...ignore the scale I'm on.
TitleTimeTalk_23_05	In fact, how about we just move on?\nShall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_24_01	...
TitleTimeTalk_24_02	...Well, what do you think? Have you\nnoticed what's different?
TitleTimeTalk_24_03	...
TitleTimeTalk_24_04	I got new glasses! Aren't they great?
TitleTimeTalk_24_05	Well, I like them.\nShall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_26_01	Do you...ever get the urge to tell\nghost stories?
TitleTimeTalk_26_02	...
TitleTimeTalk_26_03	Because ghosts scare me. So please\ndon't tell any while I'm around.
TitleTimeTalk_26_04	Well, with that admission out of the\nway...shall we b-begin?
TitleTimeTalk_27_01	Few things are more refreshing after a\nlong day than a good shower.
TitleTimeTalk_27_02	Sometimes I even forget to take off this\nsuit, and...
TitleTimeTalk_27_03	You know what? Maybe we should just\nmove along.
TitleTimeTalk_27_04	What? It dries out just fine.\nLet's begin, shall we?
TitleTimeTalk_28_01	Balance is important in all things, but...
TitleTimeTalk_28_02	here at the academy, when it comes to\nthe brawniness of one's brain...
TitleTimeTalk_28_03	we say brawnier is always better!
TitleTimeTalk_28_04	That's just how we roll here.\nEr...I mean that's how we think.
TitleTimeTalk_28_04_02	I'm really not much of a roller, frankly.
TitleTimeTalk_28_05	Well, I hope you're feeling brawny.\nShall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_29_01	Can't sleep? It can be hard to focus\nwhen you're tired.
TitleTimeTalk_29_02	You wouldn't want your Big Brain to\nbecome less brawny, would you?
TitleTimeTalk_29_03	Well, just don't stay up too late.\nShall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_30_01	The world is, of course, round.\nHowever...
TitleTimeTalk_30_02	have you ever wondered what things\nwould be like if it were another shape?
TitleTimeTalk_30_03	These are the kinds of questions that \nkeep me up at night...
TitleTimeTalk_30_04	Like, what if it was an octahedron?!\nOh! Shall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_31_01	I often wonder if something gets lost as\nwe learn more about the world.
TitleTimeTalk_31_02	Long ago, people were happy to label\nthings "magic" or "sorcery" and so on.
TitleTimeTalk_31_03	To me, there is a unique beauty to a\nmind that sees magic all around it.
TitleTimeTalk_31_04	And where there is magic, there are\nsure to be wizard hats. I'm sure I'd look\nquite fetching in one...
TitleTimeTalk_31_05	Well, that's enough fantasy!\nShall we begin?
TitleTimeTalk_32_01	What does it mean for a brain to be\nbrawny?
TitleTimeTalk_32_02	I've been struggling with this question\nfor quite some time.
TitleTimeTalk_32_03	Sure, we know that the earth is big.
TitleTimeTalk_32_04	But how brawny is the entire earth?
TitleTimeTalk_32_07	And how would you even measure\nthat? I have no idea...
TitleTimeTalk_32_08	Well, before I get lost in thought...\nshall we begin?
TitleTalk_01	I wonder... What will the world be like in\n100 years?
TitleTalk_02	I can't help think about where humans\ncame from...and where they might\nbe going.
TitleTalk_03	I wonder... What is it like out in the far\nreaches of the universe?
TitleTalk_04	This suit has become a bit...snug.
TitleTalk_05	Is sun in the forecast for tomorrow?\nI should check...
TitleTalk_06	I'm rather hungry all of a sudden.\nNow...where did I put that snack?
TitleTalk_07	...Floating in the water off a deserted\nisland... Yes...that would be lovely...
TitleTalk_08	What does it mean to "be in shape"?\nIf I had to pick a shape to be in, it\nwould be a triangle!
Error_NoGhost_01	The Ghost could not be found.
Error_NoPlayLog_01	The Ghost could not be found.
Error_NoConnection_01	It seems we can't search for a Ghost\nright now.
