You got a Dream Gem!
This is the lovely island of the Yoshis.
At the topmost peak of the island sits a glistening,<cf>gem-set wonder known as the Sundream Stone.
Legends say the Sundream Stone possesses the power<cf>to make anyone's wildest dreams come true!
One fine day...
Baby Bowser and Kamek caught wind of the<cf>Sundream Stone and made their way to the island.
Eeeheehee! We'll be taking that!
When the Yoshis came to, they found<cf>themselves in an unfamiliar forest...
Aw... The poor Yoshis seem to be lost...
Oh my! The Dream Gems—they're all gone!
The Sundream Stone isn't looking too hot now...
What a tragedy! Someone better find those gems<cf>before Kamek and Baby Bowser get to them.
Wonder where this path leads...
Maybe it'll pave the way to the gems!
Looks like the Yoshis are sorting out<cf>who should go on this mission.
How many Yoshis should go?
One
Two
Which Yoshi?
Which Yoshis should go?
All set?
Yup!
Not quite...
It's settled, then!
The rest of the Yoshis will stay and protect<cf>the Sundream Stone. It'll be safe and sound!
The journey to find the gems begins!
That thing looks like<cf>it's seen better days...
Without its gems, it seems the stone<cf>has lost all of its power. Useless!
Then we'd better get moving and find<cf>the gems before the Yoshis do!
Did one of those gems really<cf>wind up around here?
Pretty sure it was in this area...
Aw shoot! YOU again? Blech.
Argh, how did he catch up so quickly?!
Argh, how did they catch up so quickly?!
Wait a tick. Could he have<cf>already found some gems?
Wait a tick. Could they have<cf>already found some gems?
Heh! He hasn't even found one.<cf>He's completely clueless!
Heh! They haven't even found one.<cf>They're completely clueless!
Get rid of him now so we can keep<cf>looking without him in the way!
Get rid of them now so we can keep<cf>looking without them in the way!
Understood, Your Shortness! Allow me.

I'm gonna make bird feed outta you,<cf>bubsies!
Pfft, what?! WHERE?
I think he's full of stuffing, Your Nastiness!
You're LYING, AREN'T you! You big...LIAR FACE!
I NEED me a gem! Pronto!
I'm gonna make bird feed<cf>outta you, bubsies!
Yep!
Nope!
Oho! You're one tough cookie, aren't<cf>you? Well this is FAR from over.
Oho! You're some tough cookies, aren't<cf>you? Well this is FAR from over, buckos.
Check out that sweet ride! It's bigger<cf>than mine, too... I want a bigger train!
Your Stinkiness, we must maintain<cf>our focus if we're to find the—
Don't care. I want a bigger train. Mine's<cf>not big enough! Or COOL enough!!
I want a...a GATOR train. I want one I want<cf>one I want one! Make it for me now!
There's no time, Your Brattiness! We must<cf>continue our quest for the gems, or—
Gems, shmems! Make me<cf>a gator train RIGHT NOW!
That is out of the question!
No fair no fair no fair!!
Enough! See this<cf>foot? It's going down!
Yo, Yoshi! Yeah, you. Don't just<cf>stand there—gimme a hand!
Yo! Yeah, you. Don't just stand<cf>there—gimme a hand!
You're not gonna let Kamek<cf>shove me around, are ya?
Who's the right one? Me or Kamek?
FINE! If you're going to be that way,<cf>I'll make the silly thing! Ugh.
But I warn you, Yoshi... You're about<cf>to be neck deep in regret!
SERIOUSLY?! Who<cf>asked YOU, anyway?!
How dare you anger His Roly-Polyness!<cf>Your insolence must be punished!
I'll make you the *ahem* COOLEST train<cf>you've ever seen, Your Brutishness!
You!
Kamek!
Hrmmm... There's more than meets<cf>the eye with this party ball...
Maybe it's got a buncha<cf>gems inside!
I'm gonna bust it open and see!
Hmm, I need something to throw at it...
Your Awfulness! Please wait!
Waaah! Yoshi broke open the ball himself!
YOSHI! I'll have you know His Grossness<cf>was looking forward to breaking that ball!
Grrrr! You're gonna get SMASHED!
My piranha plant will gobble you<cf>up and show you what's what!
You better back off!<cf>I'M gonna break that!
What kinda lame joke is this?<cf>Where are the gems?!
You switched out the contents—admit it!
Grrrarrr! You're gonna get SMASHED!
Break it!
Leave it be.
Hold it right there, Yoshi!
Hold it right there!
You are NOT gonna get in our way<cf>this time! Those gems are OURS!
Your Reckless Majesty! Careful now!
I'm a natural on this thing! It's OK to<cf>be jealous of my awesome skills.
You don't actually think you can<cf>do this better than me, do you?!
Grrrrr how DARE you!
Your Spikiness!
<Tag Size="150">IT'S ALL YOUR<cf>FAULT, YOSHI!</>
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!
Eeek! Let's see how YOU like<cf>getting dunked in the sea, chum!
Eeek! Let's see how YOU like<cf>getting dunked in the sea, chums!
Hah! This fella knows awesome<cf>when he sees it!
<Tag Size="150">IT'S ALL YOUR<cf>FAULT!</>
Skree! Yes, if you'd answered hones—<cf>Er, that is, this is ALL YOUR FAULT!
Skree! Yes, if you'd answered hones—<cf>Er, that is, this's ALL YOUR FAULT!
Sure I do!
Eh... Not so much.
Grarrr! How do they have<cf>THAT many gems already?!
That's IT. I'm gonna ambush<cf>those stupid Yoshis!
Your Stubbiness, listen here.<cf>I have a MUCH better idea.
We'll hide out in front<cf>of the last gem, and...
Skreeheehee! Thanks for going to all<cf>the trouble to gather these for us!
At last we have succeeded! His Pushiness<cf>will finally see his dreams fulfilled!
Ah, yes. All of our tribulations<cf>have been worth this fated day.
FINALLY we got them all. Hurry up!<cf>I wanna make my dream happen!
Of course, Your Stumpiness. Make a wish!<cf>Whatever your stinky little heart desires!
<Tag Size="150">I want the biggest, baddest,<cf>most awesomest...ROBOT!</>
What have you done to<cf>His Petulance?!
Worry not—I will help you!
Sundream Stone! Grant His Impishness<cf>even more strength!
Oh my! I...may have overdone it...
How DARE you do this to His Pokiness!
You will pay for this! Someday!
Skreeeee!!
And so, the Sundream Stone was finally restored.
Together, the Yoshis dreamed...
that they could be returned to their island home!
All right, let's head back home!
The Yoshis were finally returned<cf>home to their peaceful island...
And they lived happily ever after!
THANK YOU<cf>FOR<cf>PLAYING
Well, well, well. I see you<cf>made it to my hideout...
I'm still in a tizzy over your treatment<cf>of His Waspishness the other day.
Your cruelty knows no end! Well. I'll<cf>set you straight MYSELF this time!
If you think you're going to<cf>find any gems, think again!
In fact, you'll never even leave THIS place.
Without a working train, you're<cf>dead in your tracks! Good luck<cf>finding the missing parts.
And where do you think you're going?
I'll send you to your watery doom!
Skree! You don't give up easy, do you?
My treacherous traps will be your doom!
YOU AGAIN? You are driving me CRAZY.
I won't allow you to go<cf>ONE. STEP. FURTHER.

Ugh, I'm wiped out. If only I had a<cf>Smiley Flower...
Ugh, I'm wiped out. If only I had <cf>{number} Smiley Flowers...
Give
Don't give
Thanks! That really puts<cf>a spring in my step!
Welcome to {AreaName}!
Say, could you help me find some<cf>souvenirs here in {AreaName}?
Let's see here...
I've got another request...
Any luck finding what I'm hoping for?<cf>Have a look here in {AreaName}.
I'd love {CraftName_a}, please.
I'd love {CraftName_a}, please.<cf>I think {number} should do the trick!
If you see one, just toss<cf>an egg at that sucker!
Woo! You found me {CraftName_a}!
As thanks for your help, I<cf>present you with...this!
Flowers draw a smile on<cf>just about anyone's face!
If someone's feeling low, just hand 'em<cf>some Flowers. That'll do the trick!
Hmmm...check back in<cf>with me later, will ya?
I'm fresh outta requests for ya!
Isn't {AreaName} grand? Come visit any ol' time.
Huzzah! You collected all the<cf>Smiley Flowers in {AreaName}.
Congratulations! You collected all the<cf>Smiley Flowers in {AreaName}!
I've gone for a stroll. Check back later,<cf>why don'tcha?<cf>                             Coal Blockafeller
Seems like ya stopped by while<cf>I was out meandering.
You're Yoshi, right?
You're the Yoshis, right?
I heard about you from my<cf>little brother Fin. I'm Coal.
Thank you! I feel good as new!
Allow me to open up this<cf>area for ya. Just a sec!
Phew, I feel so much better<cf>after that Smiley Flower!
I'm Fin the flower fan! Fin Blockafeller if<cf>you're feeling formal. How d'ya do?
Yoshi, is it? Whaddaya doin' here?
Yoshi, is it? Whaddaya'll doin' here?
In search of gems, huh?
Hm. Well I did see something shimmering<cf>in the sky that landed not far from here...
Lemme see...
Pretty sure it fell somewhere<Tag Event=""/> over there.
Just follow this road, and<cf>you're sure to find it!
Best of luck!
Hey, Yoshi!
Hey there!
How'd ya like {AreaName}?<cf>So much to see, huh?
I've been hoping for a local souvenir...
Hiya. Welcome to<cf>{AreaName}!
The path forks ahead—head whichever<cf>direction tickles your fancy!
There we go. Now I'm feeling super swell!
Lemme just get out of your way. Hup!
Thank you so much for the help. Say,<cf>how'd you find your way out here?
On the hunt for gems, are we? Hm.
I do hope you enjoy your time<cf>here—have a look around!
You cleared all the {BossName}<cf>boss challenges!
I saw an odd fellow in blue robes soaring<cf>above—maybe headed to a graduation?
Whatever the case, I got the sense he's up<cf>to no good, so best be careful now.
It's probably wise to keep your<cf>gem mission under your shell.
Yoshi, you're superb!
How clever of you to use those magnets<cf>to your advantage, ho ho!
Best wishes on your search for the gems.
I'm growing some vegetables in a garden<cf>up the way here.
There's a rather large party ball around<cf>there.
I wonder if it's hiding any gems inside...<cf>You never know 'til you try!
Yoshi, you're astounding!
To think you'd smash open those balls<cf>and use what's inside to take him out!
My, but so clever! Continued well wishes<cf>on your quest for the gems.
I saw a young creature out on the sea...<cf>Seemed to be looking for something.
I imagine the penguins were laughing at<cf>him fumbling about on that ball of his.
I'm betting you can do better than that.
Yoshi, you amaze!
The way you tossed Bumpty at him to<cf>make him fall into the water! Genius!
I hope your journey to find the<cf>gems continues to go well!
I spotted a blue-robed fellow,<cf>by the train tracks in the jungle.
It appeared he was squabbling with<cf>someone. My, was he steamed!
It's times like this that one<cf>must keep their wits!
Yoshi, you are a wonder!
Fighting atop a steam train, brave as ever!
May you journey well in your bold quest!
I did see something shimmering fall<cf>to the ground just over there...
I'm sure if you continue on, you'll<cf>come across whatever it was.
Ah, also, I saw that bluish lad zoom<cf>through here. You may want to hurry!
Oof, I'm fresh out of energy...
I so desperately want to scale this<cf>mountain. Can you provide {number} Flowers?
Ah, thank you very much! Good as new!
Ah, and here we are...
Oof, oh my. Fresh out of energy, once<cf>again.
I'll be needing more Smiley Flowers...
The view from up here is superb!
I can't thank you enough. I live<cf>for incredible views!
This is the life!
Yoshi, you are stellar!
I watched the entirety of<cf>your battle from here.
I was so enrapt that I completely<cf>forgot to feed myself! I'm famished.
I'm absolutely starving... What say to<cf>giving me {number} Smiley Flowers?
My thanks to you! I'm full as can be!
Here, allow me to give<cf>you something in return.
Well hullo there! Yoshi, is it now? Mmhrm.<cf>I've heard all about you, m'boy.
Whazzat? Gathering gems, are ye?
Listen here, m'boy—listen well. Name's<cf>Crumples. I know all's worth knowin'.
C'mere and have a wee peek at this.
The gems yer after flew here<Tag Event=""/>, here<Tag Event=""/>, and...<cf>here<Tag Event=""/>.
Told ya I know all's worth knowin'. It's up<cf>to you to decide in which order to gather.
You'll sort it out, whippersnapper.
It's been a bit, hasn't it? Good seein' ya!
You're falling short on the<cf>gems, there, m'boy.
The others can be found here<Tag Event=""/> and here<Tag Event=""/>.
Take a gander over here<Tag Event=""/>...
Just a wee bit more of 'em.<cf>You'll do fine, I've no doubt.
Looks to me like yer cup overfloweth<cf>with gems, meheh!
I think there's one just beyond here.<cf>Be careful out there, m'boy.
Hiya! You're Yoshi, yeah?
Hiya! You're the Yoshis, yeah?
Whee! Thought so!
I'm Sprout Blockafeller! Wanna play<cf>some hide-and-seek?
I'll go hide in some places now. So<cf>you come and find me, K? ...K!
Off I go! Heehee!
This is a mining area.
You've heard of magnets before, right?<cf>They stick to metal things...
And here is the port, with the<cf>vast, open ocean beyond!
Just be wary of the pirates around here.
Just look at these beautiful gardens!
Although, some pesky Monty Moles have<cf>been digging them up left and right. Hmph.
Ever dreamed of landing on the moon?<cf>Now that dream can come true!
It seems counterintuitive, but you can get<cf>closer to space from the ground.
Oof, it sure is hot here!<cf>Be sure to hydrate!
Ever built a castle out of<cf>sand? So impermanent...
This place is hot, steamy, and<cf>just about ready to blow!
See that peak peeking out over there?<cf>That's the tip of a giant volcano!
Gosh, I sure do love it here. It's<cf>such an upbeat place, huh?
Sunbathing, cumulus clouds, playing in<cf>the water! Sunny days are the best.
Nothing like a forest stroll to clear your<cf>head and reconnect with nature.
Keep an eye out for adorable<cf>acorns and pinecones!
Isn't it magical here?
Everything here is soft as clouds and made<cf>of yarn and felt. Mmm, snuggly!
Just breathe in that fresh salt air!
Why not explore these balmy southern<cf>seas or chill out in the icy oceans ahead?
Here we have the hidden ninja hideout...
This place is riddled with<cf>traps, so stay sharp!
This is the lush jungle area.
The jungle is home to all<cf>sorts of living creatures.
Oh, what fun! I just love a<cf>good amusement park!
What's your favorite ride at amusement<cf>parks? Mine's the whirlyzippler! Y'know it?
This is a town of darkness...
The electric sparks can<cf>hurt or hinder, so beware...
The path continues to unfold from here.
Surely if you follow your heart—and this<cf>path—you'll find whatever you seek.
