EXB_CLear5B_P1_Subject00	Ride Like the Wind
EXB_CLear5B_P1_Subject01	What Turbo Can Do for You
EXB_CLear5B_P1_Body00	The keys to a quick clear time are\nmastering turbo and jump techniques\nand picking an efficient racing line.\nScope out the jumps and any hazards\nas you approach them.
EXB_CLear5B_P1_Body01	Turbo () accelerates faster than\nregular acceleration (), so use it\nat the very start, for a speed\nburst before a jump, and to get\nmoving again after landing. But be\ncareful not to overheat!
EXB_CLear5B_P1_Body02	Start off strong by\nusing turbo () out of\nthe gate. This will get\nyou moving quicker.
EXB_CLear5B_P1_Body03	Move to the topmost\nlane to catch the cool\nzone. This will help\nprevent overheating.
EXB_CLear5B_P1_Body04	Avoid the mud just\npast the cool zone,\nthen stay in that\nlane to jump.
EXB_CLear5B_P1_Body05	Land on the downward\nslope to build some\nmomentum before\nthe next big hill.
EXB_CLear5B_P1_Body06	If you have enough\nmomentum, you can\njump all three of\nthese hills at once.
EXB_CLear5B_P2_Title00	The Ultimate Guide to Motocross Maestro!
EXB_CLear5B_P2_Subject00	You're Not Too Cool to Skip This Tip
EXB_CLear5B_P2_Subject01	Get a Good Angle on the Land
EXB_CLear5B_P2_Body00	Riding over a cool zone will lower\nthe Temp meter to help keep you\nfrom overheating. The more you\nride over, the more turbo you can\nuse, so be sure to hit as many\nas you can.
EXB_CLear5B_P2_Body01	If your bike's angle and the angle of your landing point don't\nmatch, you'll lose speed or even take a tumble. Make sure\nyour bike's angle is parallel with the ground when landing.
EXB_CLear5B_P2_Body02	Wheelie over the\nhurdle to hit the\nsecond cool zone.
EXB_CLear5B_P2_Body03	Lower your front wheel\nafter this jump to jump\nfarther.
EXB_CLear5B_P2_Body04	There's mud right after\nthe jump. Make sure to\nstay in this lane so you\ncan avoid it.
EXB_CLear5B_P2_Body05	Reduce your chances\nof falling after a big\njump by raising your\nfront wheel.
EXB_CLear5B_P2_Body06	Skip this ramp so\nyou can be ready\nfor the next one.

EXB_CLear5B_P3_Subject00	If You Can Dream It, You Can Jump It
EXB_CLear5B_P3_Subject01	Don't overheat!
EXB_CLear5B_P3_Body00	If you lower the front wheel\nduring a jump, you'll gain a little\nspeed and go farther. Raising\nthe front wheel will slow you\ndown, but you'll go higher.
EXB_CLear5B_P3_Body01	Determine how far you want\neach jump to take you, then\nadjust your bike's angle to\nmake it happen.
EXB_CLear5B_P3_Body02	Lower the front wheel\nto gain distance, but\nadjust your bike's\nangle before landing.
EXB_CLear5B_P3_Body03	Don't worry about the\nsmall hill between the\ntwo bigger hills. You\ncan jump right over it.
EXB_CLear5B_P3_Body04	It's the homestretch!\nMove to the topmost\nlane, but watch out for\nthe mud patch.

MRD_Escape_NES_Subject01	Normal Jump ()
MRD_Escape_NES_Body01	This jump is easy to control with\n, making it easier to land on the\nsmall ledges. The longer you hold\n, the higher you'll jump.
MRD_Escape_NES_Subject02	Spin Jump (＋)
MRD_Escape_NES_Body02	You can jump long distances\nby running to build momentum\nfirst. However, controlling this\nwith  is more difficult.
MRD_Escape_NES_Subject03	Pattern Recognition
MRD_Escape_NES_Body03	The ledges are placed in a consistent\npattern, so you can practice until you\nget a handle on it. Your landing will be\nmore stable if you use normal jumps\ninstead of spin jumps.
MRD_Escape_NES_Subject04	Take Back Control
MRD_Escape_NES_Body04	If you press  to fire your\nweapon while spin jumping,\nyou'll cancel it into a normal\njump and regain control.
