NoTicket	Oh, you don't have any tickets?\nWell, I simply HATE to turn anyone\naway with an empty belly, but...\nCome back when you have some\ntickets, dear.
RemainOtherBoost	Well, don't you have an appetite!\nYou still have the effect you got\nfrom your last order, dearie.{[0004]}I'd be happy to make you something\nfresh, but it'll override the effect\nyou had before. Is that OK?

The more wins\nyou rack up, the higher your {color[0100]}rank{color[ffff]} will soar.\n\nThere are two styles of Anarchy Battle:\n{color[0100]}Open{color[ffff]} and {color[0100]}Series{color[ffff]}.
BankaraMatch_Manual02	If you're a solo player, {color[0100]}Series {color[ffff]}is your chance to\nknuckle down for some serious splatting.\n\nFirst, you'll pay Rank Points to cover the\n{color[0100]}entry fee{color[ffff]}. Then you'll play matches until you\nearn either five wins or three losses. Don't\nworry—you can take breaks between matches.\n\nOnce it's over, you'll earn Rank Points based on\nyour wins and any medals you earned.
BankaraMatch_Manual03	If you like to squad up with friends, or if you're\na solo player that only has time for a single\nmatch, {color[0100]}Open{color[ffff]} is for you. Here you'll gain (or lose!)\nRank Points after every battle.\n\nBoth Series and Open also give you the choice to\nstay with your team once a battle ends.
BankaraMatch_Manual04	Anarchy Battles come in four flavors:\n{color[0100]}Splat Zones{color[ffff]}, {color[0100]}Tower Control{color[ffff]}, {color[0100]}Rainmaker{color[ffff]},\nand {color[0100]}Clam Blitz{color[ffff]}.\n\nYour Rank Points are {color[0100]}shared{color[ffff]} between all four.\nBuild your rank up in one, and your rank goes\nup across the board.
BankaraMatch_Manual05	Want to be promoted to a new rank? Once you\nhave enough Rank Points, you can take on a\nspecial {color[0100]}challenge{color[ffff]}: the {color[0100]}Rank-Up Battle{color[ffff]}! Pay\nyour Rank Points, and get ready to fight. Earn\n{color[0100]}3 wins{color[ffff]}, and you'll earn a rank promotion!\n\nBut! Get three losses, and you're out. You'll also\nneed to earn more Rank Points to try again.\nOuch...
BankaraMatch_Gachiarea_Title	Splat Zones: The Rules
BankaraMatch_Gachiarea_Manual00	Splatter the Splat Zones with ink, then hold your turf to emerge victorious!
BankaraMatch_Gachiarea_Manual01	1. Splat Zone\n2. Control Indicator\n3. Progress Countdown\n4. Penalty Countdown
BankaraMatch_Gachiarea_Manual02	Whichever team can hold all {color[0100]}Splat Zones{color[ffff]} long\nenough for the timer to reach zero wins!\n\nFirst, claim Splat Zones by covering them in ink.\nYou can see how much of a zone you've inked\nby looking at the {color[0100]}control indicator{color[ffff]}. Claim all the\nSplat Zones, and your team's {color[0100]}timer{color[ffff]} will start to\n{color[0100]}count down{color[ffff]}. If the timer hits zero, that's a\nknockout victory!
BankaraMatch_Gachiarea_Manual03_Title	Splat Zones: Pro Tips
BankaraMatch_Gachiarea_Manual03	・ Work with your team!\n    Going solo to retake a Splat Zone guarded by your opponents is NOT easy.\n    Group up with your allies and strike together! Or, if you're defending, try\n    to scatter your opponents and stop them from working as a team.\n\n・ Never give up, even if you're losing!\n    When the enemy team controls the zones or when you're behind in the\n    countdown, your special gauge will start filling automatically!
BankaraMatch_Gachiarea_Manual04	・ Try to turn it around in overtime!\n    If time runs out with the losing team in control of the zones, the battle\n    will go into overtime. Fight to the very end, and you can come from behind\n    for an overtime win!
BankaraMatch_Gachiyagura_Title	Tower Control: The Rules
BankaraMatch_Gachiyagura_Manual00	Whichever team rides the tower to the goal in the enemy base wins!
BankaraMatch_Gachiyagura_Manual01	1. The Tower\n2. The Goal\n3. Checkpoint\n4. Goal Distance Remaining
BankaraMatch_Gachiyagura_Manual02	Ride the {color[0100]}tower{color[ffff]} from the center of the stage to\nthe {color[0100]}goal {color[ffff]}in the enemy base to win!\n\nInk the sides of the tower, and climb on top to\nclaim it. The tower will start moving toward the\nenemy base automatically.\n\nIf you get splatted and the enemy takes control\nof the tower, or if it sits for too long without\nanyone on it, it will move back toward the center\nof the stage.
BankaraMatch_Gachiyagura_Manual03	There are {color[0100]}checkpoints{color[ffff]} along the route to the\ngoal. Ride the tower to a checkpoint, and it will\nstop for a short while. Keep control of the tower\nuntil the checkpoint's defenses are gone, and\nthe tower will start moving again.\n\nFully clear a checkpoint once, and the tower\nwon't need to stop at it again. However, if a\ncheckpoint isn't fully cleared, its defenses\nwill return!
BankaraMatch_Gachiyagura_Manual04	As the tower gets near the goal, your team's\n{color[0100]}goal distance {color[ffff]}will {color[0100]}decrease{color[ffff]}. If the tower can't\nreach either goal before time runs out, the team\nwith the lowest goal distance wins.
BankaraMatch_Gachiyagura_Manual04_Title	Tower Control: Pro Tips
BankaraMatch_Gachiyagura_Manual05	・ Protect the tower!\n    Anyone riding the tower is an easy target, so have teammates scout ahead\n    to make sure the way is safe!\n\n・ Take the tower back at checkpoints!\n    Don't forget that the tower stops at checkpoints. That makes it the\n    perfect time to attack and take it for your team!
BankaraMatch_Gachiyagura_Manual06	・ Turn it around in overtime!\n    If the losing team controls the tower when the clock runs out, the battle\n    goes into overtime. Don't give up—you might be able to come from behind\n    to win it in overtime!
BankaraMatch_Gachihoko_Title	Rainmaker: The Rules
BankaraMatch_Gachihoko_Manual00	Bring the Rainmaker to the goal in the enemy base to win!
BankaraMatch_Gachihoko_Manual01	1. The Rainmaker\n2. The Goal\n3. Time Left to Carry the Rainmaker\n4. Goal Distance Remaining\n5. Checkpoint
BankaraMatch_Gachihoko_Manual02	The team that gets the {color[0100]}Rainmaker{color[ffff]} and carries\nit to the {color[0100]}goal{color[ffff]} in the enemy base wins!\n\nFirst, run to the Rainmaker in the middle of the\nstage, then break it out of its shield to grab it.\n\nIf the Rainmaker is dropped, the shield will slowly\nreturn. Leave the Rainmaker for too long, and\nit will automatically go back to its starting\nposition in the middle of the stage.
BankaraMatch_Gachihoko_Manual03	When you're carrying the Rainmaker, you can't\nSuper Jump or use your weapons. However, you\nCAN fire a super-powerful {color[0100]}Rainmaker Shot{color[ffff]}!\n\nAlso, carrying the Rainmaker is dangerous.\nIf you hold on to it for too long, it will explode\nand splat you. Be careful!
BankaraMatch_Gachihoko_Manual04	Once you've got the Rainmaker, head for the\n{color[0100]}checkpoint{color[ffff]}.\n\nAfter you clear the checkpoint, your next stop\nis the goal. If you get pushed back, you can run\nright through any checkpoints your team has\nalready cleared.\n\nAs you get closer to the checkpoint and then\nthe enemy goal, your team's {color[0100]}goal distance{color[ffff]} will\n{color[0100]}decrease{color[ffff]}. If time runs out before the Rainmaker\ngets to a goal, the team with the lowest\ngoal distance wins.
BankaraMatch_Gachihoko_Manual05_Title	Rainmaker: Pro Tips
BankaraMatch_Gachihoko_Manual05	・ Move that Rainmaker!\n    The most important thing is to get the Rainmaker to the goal! If you have\n    the Rainmaker, push forward. If a teammate has the Rainmaker, start\n    clearing a path for them. Keep the Rainmaker moving forward!\n\n・ Never give up, even if you're losing!\n    If your opponents have the Rainmaker, or if your team is both behind in\n    goal distance and doesn't have the Rainmaker, your special gauge will\n    start filling automatically!
BankaraMatch_Gachihoko_Manual06	・ Try to turn it around in overtime!\n    If the losing team controls the Rainmaker when time runs out, the battle\n    goes into overtime! Keep up the pressure, and you might come from behind\n    and win it in overtime!
BankaraMatch_Gachiasari_Title	Clam Blitz: The Rules
BankaraMatch_Gachiasari_Manual00	The team that gets the most clams in their enemy's basket wins! You'll need to\nuse a power clam to take down the basket's barrier first.
BankaraMatch_Gachiasari_Manual01	1. Clams\n2. Power Clams\n3. The Basket\n4. Score Countdown
BankaraMatch_Gachiasari_Manual02	5. Barrier Timer\n6. Team Clam Total\n7. Clams You're Holding\n8. Player Clam Totals
BankaraMatch_Gachiasari_Manual03	The team that throws the most {color[0100]}clams {color[ffff]}into the\nother team's basket wins! Just don't forget that\nthe baskets have a {color[0100]}barrier{color[ffff]} around them.\n\nFirst, you need to break the barrier. Collect\nclams from around the stage.
BankaraMatch_Gachiasari_Manual04	Once you have {color[0100]}8{color[ffff]} clams, they'll combine into a\n{color[0100]}power clam{color[ffff]}. Then it's time to break that barrier!
BankaraMatch_Gachiasari_Manual05	You can throw both regular and power clams by\npressing {[0300|52b85e3f03000000]} or {[0309|52b85e3f03000000]}.\n\nBreak a barrier using a power clam, and a\n{color[0100]}barrier timer{color[ffff]} will start!
BankaraMatch_Gachiasari_Manual06	Throw clams and power clams into your\nopponents' basket as fast as you can!\n\nIf you can get your score down to 0, you'll earn\na knockout victory. Each clam drops your team's\n{color[0100]}score countdown{color[ffff]} by {color[0100]}3{color[ffff]} points, while a power clam\ndrops it by {color[0100]}20{color[ffff]}!\n\nYou'll also {color[0100]}extend the barrier timer{color[ffff]} with each\nclam you throw into the enemy basket.
BankaraMatch_Gachiasari_Manual07	If your barrier is broken, your opponents' barrier\nbecomes invincible, so don't forget to defend!\nIf you see an enemy with clams, splat them quick\nto keep them from extending the barrier timer.\n\nOnce your barrier is back, a power clam will\n{color[0100]}appear under your basket{color[ffff]} to help your team\nlaunch a counterattack!
BankaraMatch_Gachiasari_Manual08	Getting splatted causes you to drop all of\nthe clams you're carrying. If you see a dropped\nregular clam, grab it quick before it disappears!\n\nGetting splatted can also cause you to drop\npower clams. These can only be picked up by\nsomeone from the same team that dropped it.\nIf an opponent drops a power clam, fight to keep\nit from being picked back up until it disappears.
BankaraMatch_Gachiasari_Manual09	Any clams on your team's ink are marked to make\nthem easy to find.\n\nNew clams appear often, so inking more turf will\nmake it easier to find and grab clams before\nyour opponents can.
BankaraMatch_Gachiasari_Manual10_Title	Clam Blitz: Pro Tips
BankaraMatch_Gachiasari_Manual10	・ Go on recon!\n    Use recon to visit the stage and learn different ways to get to each\n    basket. Knowing your way around is crucial!\n\n・ Expand your turf!\n    Ink the ground and expand your turf to make it faster and easier to find\n    more clams as they appear!
BankaraMatch_Gachiasari_Manual11	・ Never give up, even if you're losing!\n    If neither team has a power clam, or if both teams have one, whichever\n    team is losing will have their special gauges start filling automatically!\n\n・ Turn it around in overtime!\n    If the losing team has a power clam or the barrier timer is running when\n    the clock runs out, the battle goes into overtime. That's your cue to give\n    it all you've got and claim an overtime win!

Coop_Button00	Employee\nHandbook
T_TitleCoop_00	1.1.0 To All My Happy Little Workers
T_ContentsCoop_00	・ Here at Grizzco Industries, we aim to create a richer, better way of life for\n  everyone in our society through daily {color[0100]}collection of Power Eggs{color[ffff]}. We’re looking\n  for dedicated, eager workers to assist us as we move forward toward a\n  brighter future. Could that be you?\n\n・ Collecting Power Eggs can indeed be a risky business, but when standing\n  shoulder to shoulder in the thick of the action alongside {color[0100]}coworkers united\n  under the same vision{color[ffff]}, you may see yourself in a different light—an\n  innovator, a change bringer, one who rises to all challenges.
T_ContentsCoop_01	・ Naturally, you will be well rewarded for your efforts. We offer an\n  attractive and competitive {color[0100]}remuneration package{color[ffff]} to all our employees.
T_TitleCoop_01	1.1.1 Collecting Power Eggs
T_ContentsCoop_02	・ Power Eggs have come to be indispensable in supporting the modern\n  lifestyles we all enjoy.\n\n・ Power Eggs can be obtained from creatures called {color[0100]}Salmonids{color[ffff]}.\n\n・ Working for Grizzco, you’ll be responsible for collecting {color[0100]}Golden Eggs{color[ffff]} and\n  depositing them in the company-issued {color[0100]}egg basket{color[ffff]}. These Golden Eggs are\n  obtained from {color[0100]}Boss Salmonids{color[ffff]}, a far more dangerous type of Salmonid than\n  the {color[0100]}Lesser Salmonid {color[ffff]}variety.
T_TitleCoop_02	1.1.2 Earn Big Bucks—Fast!
T_ContentsCoop_03	 - Steal the Golden Eggs from the Boss Salmonids!\n - Take 'em to the egg basket!\n - And that's it! No, really—that's all there is to it!\n\n・ If you can remember that, you're ready to join the ranks at Grizzco!
T_TitleCoop_03	1.1.3 Joining the Team
T_ContentsCoop_04	・ As a new employee, you can rest assured in the knowledge that we offer\n  on-site {color[0100]}training{color[ffff]}—you won’t be thrown in at the deep end. After all, no one\n  expects you to memorize everything in your Employee Handbook right away!\n  At Grizzco, we believe experience is the best teacher.\n\n・ All you could ever want to know about Salmonids is explained\n  in detail in your {color[0100]}Salmonid Field Guide{color[ffff]}.
T_TitleCoop_04	1.1.4 Getting Started
T_ContentsCoop_05	・ All new Grizzco employees are given a {color[0100]}Grizzco Point Card{color[ffff]}.\n  Please take good care of this card—it's used to commemorate\n  your professional achievements.\n\n・ Power Egg collection is done when Salmonids engage in a behavior called\n  a "{color[0100]}Salmon Run{color[ffff]}." This is the Salmonid habit of regularly returning in large\n  numbers from their current habitat to the area where they were spawned.
T_ContentsCoop_06	・ Because our business NEVER closes here in the Splatlands, we always have\n  a need for more help collecting Power Eggs. However, where our employees\n  collect those eggs will differ based on the time of day.\n\n・ All equipment necessary for collecting Power Eggs (weapons, gear, life ring)\n  will be provided by the company. There is no need for employees to prepare\n  anything themselves, so first-timers needn’t worry.
T_ContentsCoop_07	・ This job requires the use of specially optimized equipment well suited to\n  the task at hand. This means that workers will be {color[0100]}unable to charge their\n  special gauges{color[ffff]} themselves. Instead, Grizzco will arrange for {color[0100]}two uses of\n  a special ability{color[ffff]}, which you may activate when you deem necessary. Unused\n  special-ability activations are reclaimed at the end of your shift.
T_TitleCoop_05	1.1.5 All in a Day’s Work
T_ContentsCoop_08	・ You’ll start your working day by boarding one of our chartered helicopters\n  and departing for the {color[0100]}restricted zone{color[ffff]}. Be aware that once your helicopter\n  departs, there’s no turning back. You won’t be able to return until your\n  shift is over.\n\n・ Upon arriving at the job site, {color[0100]}company-issued weapons{color[ffff]} will be distributed to\n  each employee. After you’ve received your weaponry, all you have to do\n  is wait for Boss Salmonids to appear.
T_ContentsCoop_09	・ You will receive a radio alert when Boss Salmonids are detected in\n  the vicinity. It's not possible to provide precise coordinates, so it’s\n  up to you to find the exact location of the Boss Salmonids.\n\n・ The restricted zone is subject to a mysterious magnetic field known to have\n  an effect on Inkling and Octoling sensory organs. You will be unable to use\n  the Turf Map to check your surroundings or to perform Super Jumps. You’ll\n  have to rely on good old-fashioned {color[0100]}eyesight {color[ffff]}to explore your surroundings.
T_ContentsCoop_10	・ Unfortunately, Boss Salmonids are not the only enemy you’ll have to contend\n  with. Lesser Salmonids will also interfere with your work and will need to be\n  dealt with in a suitable fashion. However, be aware that the Power Eggs\n  dropped by Lesser Salmonids are far less valuable than the Golden Eggs\n  dropped by Boss Salmonids. Therefore we ask all employees to {color[0100]}prioritize the\n  collection of Golden Eggs{color[ffff]} over Power Eggs.\n\n・ The Salmonids’ sensory organs have adapted to the contaminants in their\n  habitat, so they will not be hampered in hunting down Inklings and Octolings.\n  Be very careful—you won’t be able to hide yourself in ink.
T_TitleCoop_06	1.1.6 Forming Bonds through Cooperation
T_ContentsCoop_11	・ Facing off against a Boss Salmonid on your own is a tall order. If you find\n  yourself fighting one, use your {[030e|52b85e3f03000000]}{color[0100]}This way! signal{color[ffff]} to call for help.\n  This will communicate your position wirelessly to your coworkers.\n\n・ Carrying the Golden Eggs dropped by Boss Salmonids also requires the\n  cooperation of the whole team, as the equipment provided allows each\n  worker to carry only {color[0100]}1 Golden Egg at a time{color[ffff]}.
T_ContentsCoop_12	・ In the event that you are splatted by a Salmonid, you’ll wind up in a life ring,\n  rendering you out of action. To rejoin the fray, you must wait for {color[0100]}1 of your\n  coworkers to revive you with some of their ink{color[ffff]}.\n\n・ While in a life ring, your {[030e|52b85e3f03000000]}This way! signal will automatically change to\n  a {color[0100]}distress call{color[ffff]}. Use this to let your coworkers know that you’re in a bind so\n  they’ll come and revive you as soon as possible.
T_ContentsCoop_25	・ If you approach the egg basket while holding a Golden Egg, you can\n  press {[0300|0000803f00000000]} to {color[0100]}deposit {color[ffff]}it.\n\n・ If you're not near the egg basket, you can press {[0300|0000803f00000000]} to {color[0100]}throw a Golden Egg{color[ffff]}.\n  Use this to deposit eggs from far away, pass them to your coworkers, or\n  put them in places where they're easy to retrieve. While throwing Golden\n  Eggs is an efficient method of transport, please bear in mind that doing so\n  expends ink, so plan accordingly.
T_TitleCoop_07	1.1.7 Your Quota
T_ContentsCoop_13	・ In order to promote effective egg collection, all teams have\n  a {color[0100]}Golden Egg quota{color[ffff]}.\n\n・ The Salmonids exhibit very predictable behavior. They will react aggressively\n  to intruders in their territory, but they will return to the water after a set\n  amount of time. Teams that successfully meet their quota within that time\n  period will be given a new quota to fill.
T_ContentsCoop_14	・ This onslaught and retreat of Salmonids is called a {color[0100]}wave{color[ffff]}. The deadline to\n  meet your quota is at the end of each wave, after which it will not be\n  possible to deposit more eggs in the basket.\n\n・ Subsequently, all employees will be Super Jumped to the spawn point using\n  special Grizzco technology, where they will be {color[0100]}supplied with fresh weapons\n  and splatted workers will be revived{color[ffff]}.
T_ContentsCoop_15	・ Your shift is over at the end of the {color[0100]}third wave{color[ffff]}.\n\n・ Unfortunately, in the event that your team is {color[0100]}unable to meet its quota{color[ffff]},\n  we will have no choice but to {color[0100]}terminate your shift {color[ffff]}early.\n\n・ Additionally, if your entire work crew is splatted by Salmonids and {color[0100]}wiped out\n  during a wave{color[ffff]}, we will again have no choice but to {color[0100]}terminate your shift {color[ffff]}early.
T_TitleCoop_13	1.1.8 King Salmonids
T_ContentsCoop_22	・ In the Splatlands, there have been several reports of {color[0100]}King Salmonid\n  {color[ffff]}sightings. King Salmonids are larger and more dangerous than\n  Boss Salmonids.\n\n・ It's said that King Salmonids will gradually learn your {color[0100]}scent{color[ffff]} and will\n  appear to chase away intruders that come back over and over again.
T_ContentsCoop_23	・ If a King Salmonid shows up, we'll waive your Golden Egg quota. Instead, we\n  ask that you stay calm and focus on driving back the King Salmonid.\n\n・ If a King Salmonid appears, we'll supply you with an {color[0100]}egg cannon {color[ffff]}that turns\n  Golden Eggs into special shots that you can fire with {[0300|52b85e3f03000000]}. These shots\n  won't consume ink, so don't be shy about using them on the King Salmonid.
T_ContentsCoop_24	・ When a King Salmonid appears, all leftover special pouches will be collected\n  and then redistributed so everyone gets one. This rule ensures the most\n  efficient use of limited resources.\n\n・ You can obtain durable {color[0100]}fish scales {color[ffff]}from the bodies of King Salmonids.\n  These are a very precious resource!\n\n・ In exchange for fish scales, we will provide {color[0100]}a variety of limited-edition\n  goods{color[ffff]}, so you should absolutely try to collect as many as you can.
T_TitleCoop_08	1.1.9 Your Bonus
T_ContentsCoop_16	・ When your shift ends, you'll be awarded {color[0100]}Grizzco Points{color[ffff]} based on how well\n  your shift goes, as well as the number of Golden and Power Eggs you and\n  your coworkers have collected. After you have earned a set number of\n  points, you will receive a {color[0100]}fabulous bonus{color[ffff]}, so make sure you work your\n  very hardest to rack up those points!\n\n・ You can claim your bonuses from the {color[0100]}exchange desk inside\n  Grizzco Industries{color[ffff]}.
T_ContentsCoop_17	・ The bonus lineup changes with each recruitment drive, and your\n  Grizzco Points are also {color[0100]}reset {color[ffff]}at the end of each drive.
T_TitleCoop_09	1.2.0 Pay Grade
T_ContentsCoop_18	・ Grizzco uses an employee-rating system to help workers progress along\n  their chosen career path.\n\n・ Your pay grade increases when you{color[0100]} meet your quotas{color[ffff]} for all three waves.\n\n・ In the event that you are unable to meet your quotas, your pay grade\n  will not be increased—and may even be decreased.
T_ContentsCoop_19	・ As your pay grade increases, you’ll be given a suitable {color[0100]}title {color[ffff]}to match.\n\n・ Getting better pay grades and titles results in{color[0100]} increased bonuses{color[ffff]},\n  but even better than that, it gives you the warm, glowy feeling of\n  overcoming a challenge!\n\n・ And don’t worry! Although your pay grade will be reset for each new\n  hiring period, you’ll get to keep your title.
T_TitleCoop_10	1.2.1 Evaluation Criteria
T_TitleCoop_11	1.2.2 The Essence of the Job
T_ContentsCoop_20	・ If you remember nothing else, please remember the following\n  (everything else you can learn on the job):\n\n - Get Golden Eggs from Boss Salmonids!\n - Place eggs in the egg basket. Don't yolk around!\n - Do you really need a third bullet point? Third bullet points\n   are for eggs-ecutives.
T_TitleCoop_12	1.2.3 And to You, Our Valued Employee
T_ContentsCoop_21	・ We at Grizzco Industries are devoted to doing absolutely everything in our\n  power to create a brighter future for us all.\n\n・ As a valued member of our Grizzco family, we are committed to supporting\n  you completely as you struggle against life’s cruel realities.\n\n・ Together, we can build a company that embodies the change we wish to see\n  in the world. We are one. We are Grizzco.
Coop_Button01	Salmonid\nField Guide
T_TitleCoop_21	2.1.1 Chum, Smallfry, and Cohock
T_ExplainEnemy_00	● Basic Information\n　・ They tend to appear in groups rather than alone.\n　・ Defeating them will earn you Power Eggs.\n\n● Attack Behavior\n　・ They use their sense of smell to locate and close in on targets\n　　 who have entered their territory.\n　・ Once they close in on a target, they perform close-range\n　　 attacks using frying pans or other cookware.
T_ExplainEnemy_01	● Elimination\n　・ They can be neutralized relatively easily with a direct hit of ink.\n\n● Supporting Information\n　・ They inhabit a restricted ocean zone, and any unauthorized\n　　 contact with them is expressly forbidden by law.\n　・ The Smallfry might be weak, but they're very fast. They often\n　　 ambush their targets from below.
T_ExplainEnemy_02	　・ The larger Cohock moves slowly but packs a real punch with\n　　 direct, strong attacks.\n　・ On their own, they don't pose a significant threat—but ignore\n　　 them, and you may quickly find yourself surrounded.
T_TitleCoop_22	2.1.2 Snatcher
T_ExplainEnemy_03	● Basic Information\n　・ Tasked with procuring Golden Eggs, Snatchers will emerge from\n　　 the sea when Golden Eggs are present and try to seize them and\n　　 return to the depths.\n　・ Any snatched Golden Eggs can be retrieved by defeating this\n　　 Salmonid before it returns to the water.\n\n● Attack Behavior\n　・ They're not known to attack directly.
T_ExplainEnemy_04	● Elimination\n　・ They can be neutralized relatively easily with a direct hit of ink.\n\n● Supporting Information\n　・ New recruits usually start as Snatchers to give them a taste\n　　 of the battlefield.\n　・ Provided they demonstrate sufficient aptitude at collecting\n　　 Golden Eggs, they will be allowed to join the front lines.\n　・ In recent years, aircraft have also been brought in to improve\n　　 their egg-collection rates.
T_TitleCoop_24	2.2.1 Steelhead
T_ExplainEnemy_05	● Basic Information\n　・ An extraordinarily large specimen, it moves very slowly.\n　・ Its body is covered in hard, protective skin. Shooting it with\n　　 ink has no effect.\n\n● Attack Behavior\n　・ It generates bombs from its head, which it throws at enemies.\n　・ It can't throw these bombs very far, but the resulting explosion\n　　 covers a large area.
T_ExplainEnemy_06	● Elimination\n　・ The only way to defeat the Steelhead is to shoot ink at the\n　  bomb on its head as it inflates.\n\n● Supporting Information\n　・ It's the company commander of a Salmonid troop.\n　・ Its powerful physique is capable of supporting heavy armor, and\n　  its ink-resistant skin is the result of arduous conditioning.\n　・ It forms the bomb on its head by collecting its own explosive\n　  saliva.

T_TitleCoop_26	2.2.3 Scrapper
T_ExplainEnemy_09	● Basic Information\n　・ They're protected against almost all ink damage by their shields.\n　・ Their ability to turn rapidly allows them to keep their shields\n　　 facing their target.\n\n● Attack Behavior\n　・ The protection afforded by their shields allows them to charge\n　　 forward.

T_TitleCoop_28	2.2.5 Maws
T_ExplainEnemy_13	● Basic Information\n　・ It lurks under the surface of the ink.\n　・ It can swim in ink to scale walls.\n\n● Attack Behavior\n　・ It appears from directly beneath its prey and can swallow it in\n　  an instant.
T_ExplainEnemy_14	● Elimination\n　・ You can deal damage by shooting ink at it when it surfaces to\n　　 attack, but defeating it this way will take some time, as it is\n　　 rather robust.\n　・ To bring it down in one fell swoop, trick it into swallowing a bomb\n　　 by placing one at its point of attack.\n\n● Supporting Information\n　・ In order to sustain its large size, it must perpetually roam\n　　 around, searching for prey to consume.\n　・ It uses sonar to detect the location of suitable prey while\n　　 submerged.

T_ExplainEnemy_15	● Basic Information\n　・ It's a floaty fighter specializing in surprise attacks.\n　・ Its armored umbrella renders it essentially impervious to ink.\n\n● Attack Behavior\n　・ It fires midrange attacks using special projectiles.\n　・ Its projectiles explode into clouds that rain down ink.
T_ExplainEnemy_16	● Elimination\n　・ It's susceptible to attacks immediately after it fires.\n　・ With good timing, it's possible to reflect the shot and hit the\n　　 Drizzler with its own projectile, taking it down in one go.\n\n● Supporting Information\n　・ The ranks of the Drizzlers are made up of renegade Salmonids\n　　 who prefer to go it alone and fight on their own terms.\n　・ It's well protected against ink by unusual umbrella-like armor.\n　・ The immense recoil from discharging its weapon temporarily\n　　 exposes the Salmonid within its armor.
T_TitleCoop_30	2.2.7 Flyfish
T_ExplainEnemy_17	● Basic Information\n　・ Each of its flanks is equipped with missile launchers capable of\n　　 firing up to four missiles each.\n　・ It uses jet-propulsion technology to hover about.\n　・ It's covered in ink-repelling armor.\n\n● Attack Behavior\n　・ It's capable of locking on to two targets and firing up to four\n　　 missiles from each missile launcher.

T_ExplainEnemy_42	● Elimination\n　・ It's exposed while it's in the air getting ready to attack.\n　  That's your chance!\n　・ If you ink the ground within its ring, it won't be able to dive\n　  back under, letting you make quick work of it.\n\n● Supporting Information\n　・ It seems to idolize an animal said to have flourished in ancient\n　  times, which may explain why it wears a mask to make itself\n　  look more like this creature.\n　・ It clearly attaches more importance to the beauty of its\n　  dives than its combat effectiveness.
T_TitleCoop_41	2.2.10 Slammin' Lid
T_ExplainEnemy_43	● Basic Information\n　・ It's a pilot riding on a hovering, saucer-shaped craft.\n　・ These provide support for other Salmonids by creating\n　  a circular force field that ink cannot pass through.\n\n● Attack Behavior\n　・ Lesser Salmonids will be deployed from the hole on the bottom\n　  of the saucer.\n　・ It will try to squash targets who walk into the force field.

Defeating the pilot\n　  will destroy the craft.\n　・ Walk into the barrier under the Slammin' Lid, then quickly dodge\n　  when the craft drops down to splat you. Once it's down, that's\n　  your chance to get on top and attack the pilot.\n\n● Supporting Information\n　・ The cutting-edge technology incorporated into the craft\n　  was obtained by trading with Octarians.\n　・ Because of the high cost to build these, only highly experienced\n　  veterans are allowed to pilot them.\n　・ To save on weight, the craft has no weapons. This is why it\n　  attacks by trying to smash enemies beneath it.
T_TitleCoop_42	2.2.11 Big Shot
T_ExplainEnemy_45	● Basic Information\n　・ These set up a Big Shot launcher near the shore. The Big Shot\n　  launcher is loaded with cannonballs carried in from the sea,\n　  which it then fires.\n　・ The attending Salmonid itself is not aggressive—it just passively\n　  goes back and forth between the sea and the Big Shot launcher.\n　・ The Big Shot launcher can be used to load and fire Golden Eggs.\n　・ After the Big Shot is defeated, the Big Shot launcher will stick\n　  around until the next wave.\n\n● Attack Behavior\n　・ It will fire its cannonballs in the direction of the egg basket.\n　・ When a cannonball lands, it creates two shock-wave attacks.
T_ExplainEnemy_46	● Elimination\n　・ Take out the Salmonid operating the Big Shot launcher.\n\n● Supporting Information\n　・ Among muscle-bound Salmonids, those with belligerent\n　  personalities tend to be assigned as Steelheads, while those\n　  with calmer dispositions are assigned to Big Shots.\n　・ On Salmonid holidays, Big Shot workers like to launch special\n　  fireworks in place of cannonballs to make things more festive.
T_TitleCoop_32	2.3.1 Water Levels (High and Low Tides)
T_ExplainEnemy_20	● Low Tide\n　・ When the tide goes out, a large amount of land that is usually\n　  underwater will be exposed.\n　・ Salmonid warriors use this land as a staging ground from which\n　  to launch coordinated attacks.\n　・ During low tide, the egg basket will be stationed near this newly\n　  exposed land.\n\n● High Tide\n　・ When the tide is in, there'll be much less land available.\n　・ During high tide, the egg basket will be in its normal place.
T_ExplainEnemy_21	● Advice from Mr. Grizz\n　・ During low tide, you gotta get together and move, move, move\n　  down to that exposed land, kid!\n　・ During high tide—I don't care how hard it is—you gotta survive\n　  against those Salmonids!\n\n● Supplementary Information\n　・ The sudden and irregular changes in the water levels are a rare\n　  phenomenon unique to areas where Salmonids like to gather.\n　・ The cause is as yet unknown and is the subject of much\n　  research throughout the academic world.
T_TitleCoop_33	2.3.2 Rush
T_ExplainEnemy_23	● What Happens\n　・ Large groups of ferocious Salmonids appear and carry out rush\n　　 attacks at furious speed.\n　・ These crazed Salmonids gather whenever Glowflies appear.\n\n● How to Get Golden Eggs\n　・ Take out the Goldie hidden in the school of Salmonids.
T_ExplainEnemy_24	● Advice from Mr. Grizz\n　・ Stand your ground with your allies, and concentrate your fire on\n　　 the incoming Salmonids!\n　・ Watch out for the Glowflies—if they buzz around you, a\n　　 concentrated attack won't be far behind.
T_ExplainEnemy_25	● Supplementary Information\n　・ It is claimed that the Salmonids' increased aggression is tied\n　  somehow to gravitational shifts due to the planet's celestial\n　  course, but there is still much that is unclear.\n　・ It is said that in premedieval times, before effective defense\n　  measures such as long-range ink attacks were available, many\n　  cities fell before the rage of the Salmonid rush.
T_TitleCoop_34	2.3.3 Fog
T_ExplainEnemy_26	● What Happens\n　・ The area is covered in a dense fog, drastically reducing visibility.\n　・ Enemies will take advantage of the fog and attack from all\n　　 directions.\n\n● How to Get Golden Eggs\n　・ Defeat Boss Salmonids.\n　・ The extremely rare Goldies may appear in foggy conditions.
T_ExplainEnemy_27	● Advice from Mr. Grizz\n　・ Try to maintain contact with your teammates at all times while\n　  in the fog.\n　・ Being alone in the fog is extremely dangerous.\n\n● Supplementary Information\n　・ Goldies are extremely rare Salmonids—only one of every 10,000\n　  hatchlings is a Goldie.\n　・ They live longer than and possess far superior intelligence to\n　  normal Salmonid specimens.
T_TitleCoop_35	2.3.4 The Griller
T_ExplainEnemy_28	● What Happens\n　・ Armored vehicles called Grillers spawn one after the other.\n　　 Grillers lock their sights on to a target and will pursue it\n　　 relentlessly.\n　・ Smallfry are known for hitching a ride on the Griller and\n　　 interfering with its targeting.\n\n● How to Get Golden Eggs\n　・ Attack the weak spot on the back of the Griller to stun it.\n　・ Stunning Grillers will reveal further weak points. Attacking\n　　 these weak points is the key to taking down Grillers and getting\n　　 Golden Eggs.
T_ExplainEnemy_29	● Advice from Mr. Grizz\n　・ If the Griller has you in its sights, you're better off running\n　　 away and letting your friends handle it.\n\n● Supplementary Information\n　・ Operating costs for a single Griller would be enough to deploy\n　　 a hundred regular Salmonid fighters.
T_TitleCoop_36	2.3.5 Cohock Charge
T_ExplainEnemy_30	● What Happens\n　・ Cohocks will attack in large numbers from exposed sandbanks.\n　・ Mr. Grizz will deploy cannons for you to use in dealing with\n　  these foes.\n\n● How to Get Golden Eggs\n　・ Defeat Boss Salmonids.
T_ExplainEnemy_31	● Advice from Mr. Grizz\n　・ Use the cannons well to clear the way for your coworkers!\n\n● Supplementary Information\n　・ Apparently there are special rooms in the Salmonid barracks set\n　  aside for large numbers of Cohocks to gather and practice.
T_TitleCoop_37	2.3.6 Goldie Seeking
T_ExplainEnemy_32	● What Happens\n　・ Large numbers of gushers will appear in the area.\n　・ A Goldie will be hiding in one of the gushers.\n　・ Other Salmonids will attack in their masses from the shores.\n　・ Shooting open a gusher without a Goldie in it will cause it to\n　  erupt. Thankfully, there won't be anything hiding inside.\n\n● How to Get Golden Eggs\n　・ Reveal the Goldie by causing the gusher it's hiding in to erupt.\n　・ The Goldie will drop Golden Eggs if hit with enough ink.
T_ExplainEnemy_33	● Advice from Mr. Grizz\n　・ Spread out, and find that Goldie FAST.\n　・ When you find the Goldie, call your buddies over, and let loose\n　  with all your firepower!\n　・ The gushers emit light when you hit them—the brighter the\n　  light, the closer you are to that glorious Goldie.
T_ExplainEnemy_34	● Supplementary Information\n　・ Salmonids obtained the technology to create gushers through\n　　 trade with Octarians.\n　・ The more you hit the Goldie, the faster it will move!
T_TitleCoop_38	2.3.7 The Mothership
T_ExplainEnemy_35	● What Happens\n　・ New troops are brought to the battleground from the\n　　 Mothership.\n　・ A large number of Chinooks will bring containers of lesser\n　　 Salmonids from the Mothership to join the fray.\n　・ Periodically, the Mothership will draw close to the egg basket\n　　 and try to suck up and reclaim any Golden Eggs inside.\n\n● How to Get Golden Eggs\n　・ Shoot the containers carried by Chinooks, and they'll explode.\n　・ If you manage to blow up the Chinooks as well, they will drop\n　　 Golden Eggs.
T_ExplainEnemy_36	● Advice from Mr. Grizz\n　・ Split up to take out the Chinooks.\n　・ If the Mothership comes to take back the Golden Eggs, everyone\n　　 should focus on pushing it back!
T_ExplainEnemy_37	● Supplementary Information\n　・ The Mothership is a vital link in the Salmonid distribution chain.\n　・ Deploying the Mothership is said to be the last resort of the\n　　 Salmonid army. When it is dispatched, all troops stationed\n　　 nearby gather together to see it off.
T_TitleCoop_43	2.3.8 Mudmouth Eruptions
T_ExplainEnemy_47	● What Happens\n　・ A Mudmouth will erupt out of the hole left by a gusher and open\n　　 its huge mouth.\n　・ Lesser Salmonids will start jumping out of the Mudmouth's\n    mouth, one after another after another...\n\n● How to Get Golden Eggs\n　・ Throw a bomb into the Mudmouth's mouth. When the bomb\n　　 explodes, it'll cough up a Golden Egg.\n　・ If you throw in enough bombs, the Mudmouth will explode\n　　 and drop even more Golden Eggs!\n　・ Sometimes you'll see one covered in golden goop. Defeat it, and\n　　 it'll leave behind LOTS of Golden Eggs.
T_ExplainEnemy_48	● Advice from Mr. Grizz\n　・ Search for the Mudmouth by tracking where the Lesser\n    Salmonids are coming from.\n　・ Mudmouths multiply as time passes, so splat 'em fast!\n\n● Supplementary Information\n　・ Long ago, the Mudmouth was thought to be a spirit who haunted\n　　 the depths of the Splatlands seas.\n　・ Now, thanks to the courage and quick thinking of Splatsville\n　　 youths who thought to start throwing bombs into their mouths,\n　　 we know they're just Salmonids who got stuck in a pipe and\n　　 coated in mud.
T_TitleCoop_44	2.3.9 Giant Tornado
T_ExplainEnemy_50	● What Happens\n　・ The ground will dry up, and a gigantic tornado will whirl to\n　　 life by the shore.\n　・ Anything in the sea, including Salmonids, will be sucked up\n　　 by the tornado and flung toward land.\n\n● How to Get Golden Eggs\n　・ Boxes packed full of Golden Eggs will fall somewhere on dry land.\n　・ Break open the boxes to release a large number of Golden Eggs.
T_ExplainEnemy_51	● Advice from Mr. Grizz\n　・ Since the eggs may land far away from the basket, coordinate\n　　 with your coworkers and use the Egg Throw.\n　・ Dodge any Salmonids that come flying toward you, or splat them\n　　 as you transport the eggs.\n\n● Supplementary Information\n　・ There's no way to predict when a giant tornado might appear.\n　　 It will fling all kinds of things out from the ocean, which usually\n　　 results in a great number of Salmonid casualties.\n　・ Flying debris will be present, and accidents are bound to happen.\n　　 If you become unable to use the egg basket on dry land,\n　　 a single egg delivered to the basket will be counted as two.

Fes_Torikara_Title	Tricolor Battle Basics
Fes_Torikara_Manual00	Three teams ink turf and fight to take over Ultra Signals. At the end, the\nteam with the most turf inked wins!
Fes_Torikara_Manual01	1. Each Team's Turf Area\n2. The Ultra Signal\n3. Sprinkler of Doom\n4. Number of Ultra Signals Secured
Fes_Torikara_Manual02	After the Halftime Report, those on a runner-up\nteam can play {color[0100]}Tricolor Battles{color[ffff]} for the rest of\nthe Splatfest. Here players will fight in an\nintense two vs. four vs. two {color[0100]}Tricolor Turf War{color[ffff]}!\n\nThose on the leading Splatfest team playing an\nOpen Splatfest Battle may find themselves on\na squad of four defending against two groups\nof two players from the runner-up teams!
Fes_Torikara_Manual03	{color[0100]}Tricolor Turf Wars{color[ffff]} are (you guessed it!) special\nbattles with three ink colors fighting it out.\n\nThe Splatfest Halftime Report will announce\nwhich team is in the lead. They will become the\ndefenders, while those on the runner-up teams\nwill be the attackers.\n\nThe defenders must work to {color[0100]}ink the most turf{color[ffff]},\nwhile also defending the {color[0100]}Ultra Signal{color[ffff]} in the middle\nof the stage.
Fes_Torikara_Manual04	The attacking teams need to ink as much ground\nas possible and try to use the Ultra Signal to\ncall in help from the band Deep Cut!\n\nWhen an attacker touches the Ultra Signal, an\n{color[0100]}attempt{color[ffff]} is made. Hang on to the Ultra Signal\nlong enough, and it will be secured.
Fes_Torikara_Manual05	Once attackers secure the Ultra Signal,\nDeep Cut will deploy a {color[0100]}Sprinkler of Doom{color[ffff]},\na device that inks turf automatically!\n\nAlso, each attempt on the Ultra Signal {color[0100]}shortens\nhow long it takes to secure it{color[ffff]}, so don't let up.\nKeep up the pressure, and the Sprinkler of Doom\nwill be yours!\n\nOnly two Ultra Signals can appear per battle.
Fes_Torikara_Manual06	Clout earned by attacking teams is largely set\nby whether or not they {color[0100]}defeated the defenders{color[ffff]}.\nIn other words, it is worth far more Clout for the\ndefenders to come in last than for an attacking\nteam to come in first or second.\n\nThe Clout attackers earn is also based on {color[0100]}rank{color[ffff]},\nthe {color[0100]}number of attempts the team made on\nUltra Signals{color[ffff]}, and {color[0100]}how many Ultra Signals a\nteam secured{color[ffff]}.

Work together\nwith your teammate to find the best time to launch your special weapons and\nfigure out the best angles of attack.
Fes_Torikara_Manual08	● {color[0100]}Work with the other attacking team too!{color[ffff]}\nKeep an eye on the other attacking team—they'll be coming from the opposite\nend of the battlefield.

Minigame_Manual_Title04	The Where and How of Inking
Minigame_Manual04	If both players try to ink the same space, the {color[0100]}card with the lower number {color[ffff]}wins.\nIf cards have the same number, the overlapping ink will form an un-inkable wall!

RegularMatch_Manual01	Teams have three minutes to cover the {color[0100]}ground{color[ffff]}\nwith ink, and the team with the most {color[0100]}turf {color[ffff]}inked\nwhen time runs out wins. Get inking, and try to\nclaim as much turf as possible for your team!

Vendor_Order_Title	Gear Order Status
Vendor_Order_Manual00	If you see a piece of gear you like when talking\nto {color[0100]}other players in the square{color[ffff]}, ask {color[0100]}Murch{color[ffff]} to\norder it for you!\n\nYou can order {color[0100]}up to 3{color[ffff]} pieces of gear at a time.\nIf you already have three orders in progress and\nsee another item you want, you can order it, but\none of your existing orders will be canceled.
Vendor_Order_Manual01	Murch will receive your gear orders in the order\nthey were received, {color[0100]}1 piece per day{color[ffff]}. If you get\nreally lucky, the gear will even come with the\nsame abilities as the one that caught your eye.\n\nYou will need {color[0100]}cash{color[ffff]} to take delivery of your\norder, and the closer the gear you ordered\nis to the original, the more it will cost.
Vendor_Increase_Rarity_Title	Boost Star Power
Vendor_Increase_Rarity_Manual00	You can boost your gear's {color[0100]}star power{color[ffff]} by asking\nMurch, or by rebuying the same item when\nyou see it in stock in a shop.\n\nBoosting star power gives gear {color[0100]}more ability slots{color[ffff]}\nand makes it earn more {color[0100]}gear experience{color[ffff]}. If you\nhave any gear you use a lot, you'll definitely\nwant to boost its star power!
Vendor_Increase_Rarity_Manual01	Murch can also boost the star power of gear that\n{color[0100]}isn't for sale {color[ffff]}in shops. If you have a favorite piece\nof gear, be sure to ask him about it.\n\nMurch needs {color[0100]}Super Sea Snails{color[ffff]} to boost star\npower, and the higher it is to begin with,\nthe more Super Sea Snails he'll need.\nChoose your upgrades wisely!
Vendor_Cleaning_Title	Scrub Slots
Vendor_Cleaning_Manual00	Gear whose slots are filled with {color[0100]}secondary gear\nabilities {color[ffff]}can be {color[0100]}scrubbed clean {color[ffff]}by Murch!\n\nWhen gear is scrubbed, all of its ability slots are\nreset to how things were before any abilities\nwere added. You also get to keep any {color[0100]}ability\nchunks {color[ffff]}that are scrubbed off!
Vendor_Cleaning_Manual01	{color[0100]}Gear ability chunks{color[ffff]} can be used by Murch\nto add specific abilities to your gear. You can\nget gear ability chunks by having gear scrubbed.\n\nYou'll need {color[0100]}cash{color[ffff]} to pay for the scrubbing,\nbut the price is the same no matter how many\nabilities are on the gear, meaning you'll get\nthe best value on gear with all three slots full.
Vendor_Add_Gear_Power_Title	Add Gear Ability
Vendor_Add_Gear_Power_Manual00	Bringing the {color[0100]}gear ability chunks{color[ffff]} you've collected\nto Murch will let you pick which abilities to add\nto your gear!\n\nGear always starts out with a {color[0100]}primary gear\nability{color[ffff]} and has slots for {color[0100]}secondary gear\nabilities{color[ffff]}. Both sets can be customized to fit\nyour play style!
Vendor_Add_Gear_Power_Manual01	{color[0100]}Primary gear abilities{color[ffff]} are more powerful, but\nthey also require more chunks to customize.\nPlus, it takes a few different types of chunks\nto add some of the more interesting abilities.\n\n{color[0100]}Secondary gear abilities{color[ffff]} aren't as strong, but\nthey don't require nearly as many chunks to add\neither. However, trying to add more than one of\nthe same ability will bump up the chunk cost.
Vendor_Add_Gear_Power_Manual02	If a slot is already full, you can still add a new\nability on top of the one that's there, but you\nwon't get as many {color[0100]}chunks{color[ffff]} back for the one you\noverwrote. Also, once you overwrite an ability,\nit's gone for good.\n\nLastly, ability chunks cannot be used to add the\n{color[0100]}Ability Doubler{color[ffff]} you see on {color[0100]}Splatfest Tees{color[ffff]}.
Vendor_Replacement_Gear_Power_Title	Randomly Reroll Gear Abilities
Vendor_Replacement_Gear_Power_Manual00	Any gear with {color[0100]}all 3 of its ability slots filled{color[ffff]} can\nbe rerolled for a new set of random abilities by\ngiving Murch some {color[0100]}Super Sea Snails{color[ffff]}.\n\nWhat abilities you'll get, however, is up to luck!
Vendor_Replacement_Gear_Power_Manual01	By the way, when you reroll a piece of gear,\nyou'll get the {color[0100]}chunks{color[ffff]} from the old abilities that\nwere just erased.\n\nYou can also reroll as many times as you like,\nmeaning you can keep doing it until you've made\nthe perfect piece of gear, AND you'll collect\nplenty of chunks along the way!
Vendor_GesoTown_Title	About the SplatNet Shop
Vendor_GesoTown_Manual00	The {color[0100]}SplatNet Shop{color[ffff]} lets you order gear through\nthe {color[0100]}SplatNet 3{color[ffff]} online service, meaning you can\norder new gear even when you're not playing!\n\nThere's even gear with unique ability layouts you\nwon't see on the versions sold in Splatsville!\n\nCheck out the official Splatoon 3 website\nto learn more.
Vendor_GesoTown_Manual01	Only {color[0100]}1 piece{color[ffff]} of gear can be ordered from the\nSplatNet Shop at a time. However, those orders\nare delivered to Murch immediately, and another\norder can be made as soon as it's picked up.\n\nNever miss a chance to get gear you want!

Come back at {color[0100]}level 4{color[ffff]}.{[0004]}Just go to the {color[0100]}lobby{color[ffff]}, try a few {color[0100]}Turf\nWar battles{color[ffff]}, and you'll be fresh as\ncan be in no time splat. Good luck!
Guidance_01	This is the Tableturf Battle Dojo,\nsweetie! I'm so pleased to have you.{[0004]}You're not surprised to see me\nrunning the show here, are you?\nI may not be the youngest fish in\nthe school, but that doesn't mean\nI'm not "with it."{[0004]}And it doesn't get any more "it" than\n{color[0100]}Tableturf Battle{color[ffff]}! Simply EVERYONE is\nplaying it right now. Probably since\nit's so easy to get a starter deck\nthese days...

Guidance_03	Like this! You just got one!
Guidance_04	That {color[0100]}deck {color[ffff]}I just gave you contains\n15 cards. That's all you need to play\nTableturf Battle with anyone!{[0004]}Now, I'm sure you're itching to get\nright into a battle, but I'm afraid I\nmust insist that you read the manual\nfirst. It's long, but it's filled with all\nkinds of wonderful rules. Take a look!
Guidance_05	All done with your homework? Great!\nDon't worry if you don't understand\nevery single thing right now. It's a\ncomplicated game! And experience is\nthe best teacher.{[0004]}Come back anytime you want to\ngive it a try, OK?
NPCBattle_00	Welcome, welcome!
NPCBattle_01	Are you here for— OH! Oh no.\nYou don't have a single deck!{[0004]}That simply won't DO, dearie.\nHere's what you're going to do now.\nOpen up your menu. Go to Status and\nlook for Tableturf Battle. Build a deck\nthere, and then come right back!
NPCBattle_02	Who will you battle?
NPCBattle_03	Oh, I'm so sorry, but it doesn't look\nlike they're available right now. Why\ndon't you try again another time?
WeaponShop_Greet	So, you know I talk a big game about\nweapons, and you're wondering if I\ncan back it up, right?{[0004]}Consider what's about to happen a\nlesson! I'll be using my carefully\ncurated deck that's absolutely\nSTACKED with some of the most\nformidable cards in existence!
WeaponShop_Win	Just as I predicted—I win!
WeaponShop_Win2	Sorry—I don't get to battle much.\nThis is all I have!
WeaponShop_Lose	No! How could this happen?\nI've got to do more research...
WeaponShop_Lose2	Rest assured, I'll use the data from\nthis matchup to provide a tougher\nchallenge next time. Back to my\nresearch chamber!
WeaponShop_Draw	I can't believe it—we tied!\nWhat an unusual result.
WeaponShop_Draw2	I think, by definition, this makes us\nrivals. Well played, rival!
WeaponShop_Sleeve	Thank you for being such a worthy\nTableturf Battle competitor.{[0004]}As a small token of my appreciation,\nI got you some special {color[0100]}card sleeves{color[ffff]}!{[0004]}I look forward to many more well-\nfought battles with you in the future.

Aori_Win	Yep, I win. Never had a doubt.
Aori_Win2	Oh, but you did sooo good, Agent 3!\nThere were both chills AND thrills. We\ndefinitely gotta do it again sometime.
Aori_Lose	I...lost? Oooh, that is FRUSTRATING!
Aori_Lose2	And a load of fun too. We oughta do\nit again sometime!
Aori_Draw	A tie! Now, THAT was a fun match.
Aori_Draw2	I'm gonna beat you next time—\njust you wait. And when you're done\nwaiting, come find me so we can play!
Aori_Sleeve	Thanks for all the battles, Agent 3.{[0004]}Here—take these {color[0100]}card sleeves{color[ffff]}. Feel\nfree to name-drop who gave 'em to\nya. Swing back, and let's play some\nmore later, OK?
Atarime_Greet	Eh? You wanna try me in a card\nbattle?{[0004]}I may look crusty now, but I was a\nwiz at flippin' seashells as a kiddo.{[0100|0f000000]}\n...That's where you flip seashells\nuntil someone wins. It's a real game,\ndadgummit! Anyway, let's do this.
Atarime_Win	Yahoo! Cuttlefish wins! Guess this\nol' crustbucket can still muster up\nsome freshness on occasion, eh?
Atarime_Win2	Ah, but that wasn't easy. Keep up\nthe practice, and you'll be swabbin'\nthe deck with me in no time.
Atarime_Lose	Gah! You got me good. What a total\nsplatastrophe!
Atarime_Lose2	Maybe I oughta study the ol' rule\nbook a little more. This game's got\nreal substance to it!
Atarime_Draw	Whaddaya know? A tie!
Atarime_Draw2	Never did like ties. Not even when\nAgents 1 and 2 got me one for\nGrandpa's Day. We gotta settle this\nwith either me winning or you losing\nthe next time we face off.
Atarime_Sleeve	Agent 3, I just gotta say...I sure\nhave enjoyed battling it out with\nyou and these cards.{[0004]}And, well, I got you a little something\nas a token of my appreciation. Here—\ntake these special {color[0100]}card sleeves{color[ffff]}!{[0004]}If your card sleeves are sharp, your\nTableturf Battle game is sharp.\nThat's a Cuttlefish-certified rule\nof the tabletop battlefield!
GearShopClothes_Greet	Ah, you are here. Er, that is to say,\nI am here. For Tableturf Battle!{[0004]}Before we begin...I assume you have\nproperly washed your hands? I will\nnot tolerate filthy smudges on my\nmost precious cards.
GearShopClothes_Win	My deck is unrivaled in both style\nand strength. May that serve as\na comfort in your pitiful defeat.
GearShopClothes_Win2	You will refashion your deck after\nthis, I assume? Good. Perhaps you\nwill defeat me next time...

GearShopClothes_Lose2	I will strengthen my own deck.\nOnce I do...you must return for\nanother battle! I REQUIRE IT!
GearShopClothes_Draw	A tie, is it? I see. You are formidable.
GearShopClothes_Draw2	We have not reached the end of our\nbattles, then. A decisive outcome\nmust be reached next time! IT MUST!

Judge_Greet	Meow. ({color[0100]}Tableturf Battle{color[ffff]} is a card\ngame where you need to ink more\nspaces than your opponent to win.){[0004]}Meow!

(But that's getting ahead of\nthings... Why don't we play a match?)
Judge_Win	Meow! (Well, winning isn't everything.\nSometimes it's fun just to make the\nfur fly!)
Judge_Win2	Meow! (Hopefully you picked up a few\ntricks for your next match!)
Judge_Lose	Meow... (Grrr... Losing is so\nfurrrustrating!)
Judge_Lose2	Meow! (You definitely have a talent\nfor this. But don't take my meow for\nit—get out there, and show everyone\nelse what you can do!)
Judge_Draw	Meow... (A tie? So we're evenly\nmatched. I underestimated you!)
Judge_Draw2	Meow! (So! Not a win, but not a loss\neither. Purrrfectly respectable.\nAnd a good learning experience!)
Judge_Sleeve	Meow? (You know about {color[0100]}card sleeves{color[ffff]},\nright? They let you change the\ndesigns on the backs of your\nTableturf Battle cards.){[0004]}Meow. (Now!

JudgeJr_Win2	Mew! (On the other hand, there is\nmuch to learn from defeat! So much\nto reflect upon, so many skills to\nimprove... I envy you. Truly.)
JudgeJr_Lose	Mew... (Ah. Defeat has a bitter\ntaste...but resentment serves as\nshackles for the weak.)
JudgeJr_Lose2	Mew. (Those who win are not ensured\neternal victory. Better keep your own\ncarelessness in check...or perhaps\nyou enjoy a bitter taste?)
JudgeJr_Draw	Mew... (Tableturf Battle creates\ncurious encounters. Sometimes they\nend in neither victory nor defeat...)
JudgeJr_Draw2	Mew! (As long as we both understand\nthat this conflict was fruitless and\nheld no honor...then I guess it's OK\nto call it a draw!)
JudgeJr_Sleeve	Mew. (The use of my {color[0100]}card sleeves {color[ffff]}is\nreserved for those who have gained\nample experience through battle...\nand you have now crossed that\nthreshold.){[0004]}Mew!

Mother_Lose2	You're quite the little card battler,\naren't you? I'll have to practice if\nI want to keep up...
Mother_Draw	Ooo, ties are so frustrating, aren't\nthey? Knowing that it would've taken\njust a liiittle bit more to win...
Mother_Draw2	But it's not about winning and losing.\nThe most important part of Tableturf\nBattle is to have fun!
Mother_Sleeve	When we first met, you were like a\nwriggling, itty-bitty baby...but look\nat you now!

Area01_Analyzed_L01	As technology advanced at an exponential pace, so too did prosperity...and\nultimately conflict. Before long, the entire world was embroiled.
Area01_Analyzed_L02	In the end, nearly all life on Earth was wiped out.

Area01_Analyzed_L05	Error! Against the odds—computed to be 42,791 to 1—some humans survived.\nTherefore, the planet was only NEARLY completely inhospitable to life.
Area01_Analyzed_L06	These survivors found shelter in a vast cavern created by a\ncataclysmic volcanic eruption.
Area01_Analyzed_L07	The cavern provided shelter, and a massive pool of accumulated seawater\nprovided life.
Area01_Analyzed_L08	For while humanity was being decimated, marine life flourished.\nAll manner of squid, octopuses, and jellyfish had propagated in the deep.

Area04_Analyzed_Title	Humanity's Final Day
Area04_Analyzed_L01	The years passed with prosperity. The population of Alterna grew\nlike a rising tide.
Area04_Analyzed_L02	The scientists, now the elders of their kind, believed they had done all\nthey could to advance the civilization of Alterna.
Area04_Analyzed_L03	They began selecting new leaders to succeed them, entrusting to them the\nworld they helped build.
Area04_Analyzed_L04	Humanity's new leaders inherited both the brilliance of their predecessors\nand their unquenchable thirst for innovation.
Area04_Analyzed_L05	This new generation, born and raised in deep Alterna, would prove to be\nevery bit the match of those they were to succeed.
Area04_Analyzed_L06	They soon grew restless at the sight of the liquid-crystal sky, believing\nthey deserved to behold the reality that existed outside the cavern.
Area04_Analyzed_L07	The elders—who knew what awaited outside the safe haven of Alterna—issued\nstern warnings to the brash young scientists.
Area04_Analyzed_L08	Nevertheless, the young scientists pressed on with their plan:\nthe construction of a massive rocket ship to escape Alterna.
Area04_Analyzed_L09	Sadly, as the boosters were ignited for the first time during a launch\ntest, tragedy struck.
Area04_Analyzed_L10	The energy from the rocket boosters overloaded the cavern's liquid crystals.\nA violent and terrible chain reaction ensued.
Area04_Analyzed_L11	Without warning, the stone walls of the cavern began to shatter, raining\ndebris down upon humanity.

Area05_Analyzed_Title	Fresh Intelligence Awakens
Area05_Analyzed_L01	As the inner walls of Alterna collapsed, thousands of tons of rock\nand liquid crystal plunged into the waters below.
Area05_Analyzed_L02	As these crystals washed to and fro among the flotsam and jetsam of\nhumanity's former colony, they broke into microscopic fragments.
Area05_Analyzed_L03	Because they had repeatedly absorbed and reflected humanity's wishes over\nso many years, the crystals retained those...feelings.
Area05_Analyzed_L04	Little by little, the squids, octopuses, and assorted sea creatures that\nthrived in the waters of Alterna absorbed these crystals into their bodies.
Area05_Analyzed_L05	This process continued until, one day, the marine organisms began\nto feel something. Something...fresh.
Area05_Analyzed_L06	These fresh impulses bore a striking resemblance to humanity's\npassive desire to return to the Earth's surface.
Area05_Analyzed_L07	Spurred by these impulses—and whatever else may have been floating in the\npolluted waters—the sea creatures began to evolve rapidly.
Area05_Analyzed_L08	Each species developed pulmonary respiration, mobility, and other traits\nconsistent with land-dwelling creatures. They began to adapt.
Area05_Analyzed_L09	Their intelligence grew at a remarkable pace across generations.\nSome species even gained extraordinary camouflage capabilities.
Area05_Analyzed_L10	A point of no return arrived. The sea creatures of Alterna set foot on dry\nland and never looked back. Like humans, they strove for the surface.
Area05_Analyzed_L11	Of course, survival on land was harsh. But the creatures were persistent.\nSoon, they found the tunnels that humans had used to escape the apocalypse.
Area05_Analyzed_L12	With their path forward now clear, these fresh, fledgling beings left the\nruins of Alterna behind and set their sights on the surface world.

Area06_Analyzed_Title	The Land of Fresh Beginnings
Area06_Analyzed_L01	The beings that had emerged from the water soon emerged from the\ncavern of Alterna itself.
Area06_Analyzed_L02	From there, they flourished quickly. It wasn't long before they had\nexplored every corner of the world.
Area06_Analyzed_L03	This epochal event gave great significance to the crater above Alterna\nand its surrounding territories, now referred to as the Splatlands.
Area06_Analyzed_L04	The region would, from that point on, be known as "the land of fresh\nbeginnings" among the creatures that now thrive on the surface.
Area06_Analyzed_L05	These newly evolved beings, having scattered themselves across the globe,\nsoon gave rise to distinct cultures and unique ways of life.
Area06_Analyzed_L06	Out of all the species now roaming the Earth, squids and octopuses soon\ndistinguished themselves via intelligence and "fresh vibes," so to speak.
Area06_Analyzed_L07	It wasn't long before they became the apex species of the planet.
Area06_Analyzed_L08	Now...I must fast-forward a bit. Five thousand years later...a peculiar\nindividual was born.
Area06_Analyzed_L09	This squid quickly rose to fame in the Splatlands due to some...\nunique characteristics.
Area06_Analyzed_L10	Yes, this individual was embraced as a prophet, gifted with numerous\nrevelations that they shared among their fellow squids.
Area06_Analyzed_L11	It was another turning point for squidkind. During this period, the\nfoundations for modern cephalopod civilization were laid.
Area06_Analyzed_L12	That individual squid is now widely known and celebrated as the progenitor\nof the modern-day Inkling.

AreaEx_Analyzed_L01	Recall, for a moment, the first apocalypse that devastated the human race.\nThose who escaped into the caverns of Alterna were not the sole survivors.\nThere were others who escaped via a giant rocket ship—the Ark Polaris.\nLaunched in the nick of time, this ship was laden with many of Earth's\nspecies that had been placed in a cold sleep. The mission was simple—find\nanother planet to replace the Earth.
AreaEx_Analyzed_L02	Considering the circumstances of its launch, the Polaris had a smooth\nvoyage...until it reached the edge of the solar system. It was at that\npoint that debris struck the vessel, damaging its navigation system.\nThe crew was able to turn the ship around and head back toward Earth,\nbut the effort was in vain—there was not enough fuel to attempt a landing.\nThe Ark Polaris drifted aimlessly for 10,000 years.
AreaEx_Analyzed_L03	Eons passed. The once-stable orbit of the Polaris decayed over time until\nthe ship found itself in the inescapable pull of the Earth's gravity.\nReentry was not kind to its inhabitants—all perished, save one. Bear #03,\nan experimental subject who had retained consciousness within his cold\nhibernation, survived. For 12,000 years he had dreamed. And plotted.
AreaEx_Analyzed_L04	Fully awakened, Bear #03 came to a terrible realization. He had not\nlanded on a new planet at all. He was back on Earth. And yet, it was\nnot an Earth he knew. This Earth, it seemed, was dominated by sea\ncreatures. Not a single mammal to be found.
AreaEx_Analyzed_L05	In the course of his search for even a single fellow mammal, Bear #03 used\nnavigational equipment from the wreckage of the Ark Polaris to discover\nAlterna. It was a wasteland, of course, but a few of the liquid crystals\nthat had once covered the walls and ceiling remained. With knowledge built\nduring his thousands of years of dreaming, he repaired some of Alterna's\nfacilities and began researching the crystals...
AreaEx_Analyzed_L06	This research bore fruit when Bear #03 compounded some of the liquid\ncrystals with his own fur. The experiment created an entirely new\nsubstance with one terrifying property—it could transform any living\ncreature into a mammal. Bear #03 realized the implications immediately.\nHe could restore the planet to a mammalian paradise! He began stockpiling\nFuzzy Ooze, as he called it, within Alterna's still-intact rocket...
AreaEx_Analyzed_L07	For such a venture, he would require the acquisition of thousands of\nGolden Eggs. These were used in the creation of the Fuzzy Ooze, although\nthe exact details have never been recorded in my memory banks. But Bear #03\nhad a plan. He founded a corporation that would go on to employ locals\nto collect his Golden Eggs under the name Grizzco Industries. Mr. Grizz,\nas he was now known, would pay handsomely for them...
AreaEx_Analyzed_L08	With Fuzzy Ooze production peaking thanks to the assistance of\nunsuspecting Inklings and Octolings, Mr. Grizz took the final\nsteps to set his plan in motion. The rocket was loaded...\nIt wouldn't be long now.

Area1_1	This is the weirdest snow ever. It looks normal, but\nit's not cold. And you can ink it! What a mystery!
Area1_3	What if we put on a concert here? We could\nsell the place out, don't you think?
Area1_4	I know it doesn't look like the Captain is doing anything,\nbut I'm sure they're thinking up a plan. Go, Captain!
Area1_7	Doesn't this view just make you wanna...snowboard?
Area2_1	I guess this used to be some kind of factory. At least,\nthat's what Mar— I mean, that's what Agent 2 says...
Area2_2	Now, how would I stage a battle here...
Area2_4	If you wanna reach the highest spot here,\nlook for an {color[0100]}inkrail{color[ffff]}!

Skill_First	Oi! Have you ever {color[0100]}added a gear ability{color[ffff]}\nbefore? No big deal if you haven't.{[0004]}How it works is there's these {color[0100]}ability\nchunks{color[ffff]} you'll find everywhere.{[0004]}Mash a few of those together,\nand they can be made into any\nability you want.{[0004]}Also, if a slot's got an ability in it,\njust break the one that's there and\nstick the new one in. They {color[0100]}break into\nmore ability chunks{color[ffff]} too, which is nice.{[0004]}Maybe that was a lot to take in...but\ngive it a quick whirl, and you'll see\nit's pretty straightforward.
Skill_ExSkillDouble	Careful, chum! Once you break that\n{color[0100]}Ability Doubler{color[ffff]} and slot in another\nability, {color[0100]}there's no getting it back{color[ffff]}!
Skill_Select	Pick out the {color[0100]}gear{color[ffff]} and which {color[0100]}ability{color[ffff]}\nyou'd like.
Skill_Q	Looking good?
Skill_Set	All set! Hope it ups your battle game.\nAnd if it doesn't, well...you'll still look\ncool, so don't sweat it.
RandSkill_First	Give me a {color[0100]}Super Sea Snail{color[ffff]}, and I can\ntake all the {color[0100]}secondary abilities on a\npiece of gear{color[ffff]} and reroll them for\nrandom new ones.{[0004]}I'll even let you keep the {color[0100]}ability\nchunks{color[ffff]} from your old abilities!{[0004]}Oh! But I can only reroll slots on gear\nthat has {color[0100]}all 3 slots filled{color[ffff]}. Just\nsomething to keep in mind.{[0004]}So yeah, let's see here...
RandSkill_Select	If you've got gear with all three of\nits slots filled, I can reroll all of its\n{color[0100]}secondary abilities{color[ffff]} if you give me\na {color[0100]}Super Sea Snail{color[ffff]}. Just an idea.
RandSkill_NotEnoughShell	You got a {color[0100]}Super Sea Snail{color[ffff]} on you?{[0004]}Really? Not even one? Then go get\nyourself a {color[0100]}Super Sea Snail{color[ffff]} so we can\ntalk business, chum!
RandSkill_NotFirstShell	Oi! Sorry, chum, but I'm kinda tied\nup right now.
RandSkill_NotEnoughRarity	There's not enough {color[0100]}slots{color[ffff]} on that\ngear. I think its {color[0100]}star power {color[ffff]}is too low.{[0004]}Look, I can only reroll abilities on gear\nwith {color[0100]}3 slots{color[ffff]}. And those slots have to\nbe {color[0100]}filled{color[ffff]} too!
RandSkill_EmptySlot	Whoa, time-out. You're not using\n{color[0100]}all the slots{color[ffff]} on that gear.{[0004]}I can only reroll abilities on gear with\n{color[0100]}3 full slots{color[ffff]}. Sorry, chum.
RandSkill_Q	Reroll abilities?
RareUp_First	If you've got any {color[0100]}Super Sea Snails{color[ffff]}\nyou feel like giving me, I can use 'em\nto {color[0100]}boost your gear's star power{color[ffff]}.{[0004]}More star power means more {color[0100]}slots{color[ffff]},\nwhich means more abilities. Then,\nonce it's got all its slots, it'll start\nto earn extra {color[0100]}gear experience{color[ffff]}!{[0004]}If there's any gear you use a lot,\nyou're gonna wanna pump up its\nstar power. Trust me on it!{[0004]}Of course, the higher the star power,\nthe more {color[0100]}Super Sea Snails{color[ffff]} it'll take\nto boost further. But that's just the\nprice of perfection, right, chum?{[0004]}Anyway...
RareUp_Select	Which {color[0100]}gear{color[ffff]} needs more star power?\nIf you've got {color[0100]}Super Sea Snails{color[ffff]} for me,\nI can do it, no prob.
RareUp_NoShell	You got a {color[0100]}Super Sea Snail{color[ffff]} on you?{[0004]}Really? Not even one? Then go get\nyourself a {color[0100]}Super Sea Snail{color[ffff]} so we can\ntalk business, chum!
RareUp_NotEnoughShell	Not enough {color[0100]}Super Sea Snails{color[ffff]}?\nSorry, chum, but I don't do discounts.
RareUp_NotFirstShell	Oi! Sorry, chum, but I'm kinda tied\nup right now.
RareUp_FestT	Oi, that's a {color[0100]}Splatfest Tee{color[ffff]}. I don't\nmess with those. Sorry, but the\n{color[0100]}star power {color[ffff]}is staying like it is.
RareUp_AlreadyMax	Uh... That star power is as high as it\ngets. Totally maxed out, y'know?\nThere's nothing I can do, chum.
RareUp_Q	Boost star power?
Clean_First	You ever gotten your gear {color[0100]}scrubbed{color[ffff]}\nbefore?{[0004]}{color[0100]}Scrubbing{color[ffff]} gear wipes out all of its\n{color[0100]}secondary abilities{color[ffff]} at once, leaving\nit as clean as new.{[0004]}Take your newly {color[0100]}scrubbed{color[ffff]} gear into\nbattle, and you could end up with a\nfew new abilities on it!{[0004]}Scrubbing also leaves behind a bunch\nof {color[0100]}ability chunks{color[ffff]}. Those are all yours.\nI don't need 'em.{[0004]}Once you get enough {color[0100]}ability chunks{color[ffff]},\nmash 'em together, and you can make\nwhatever ability you like.{[0004]}Trust me, chum, you won't be the\nonly one with {color[0100]}scrubbed{color[ffff]}-up gear\nout there.{[0004]}And you should SEE some of the fresh\ngear folks are coming up with. Wow!{[0004]}Anyway, if you've got any gear you\nwant scrubbed and you've got the\ncash, then I'm your urchin!{[0004]}Now, let's see...
Clean_Select	Which {color[0100]}gear{color[ffff]} do you want {color[0100]}scrubbed{color[ffff]},\nchum? I'll get it cleaned up and\nlike new in no time.
Clean_NoSkill	Uh... This gear's already sparkling\nclean. If there aren't any {color[0100]}secondary\nabilities{color[ffff]} in it, then there's nothing for\nme to scrub!
Clean_NotEnoughMoney	You're a little light on cash, chum.\nYou oughta be careful about that.\nAn empty wallet's a sad wallet.
Clean_Q	Scrub that gear?
Clean_Done	Check it out—clean as a whistle!\nAlso, these {color[0100]}ability chunks{color[ffff]} popped\nout. They're all yours, chum!
GoodBye	Thanks, chum! You know where to\nfind me if you need anything else.

Coop_InGame_EvtRally_Prepare	The {color[0100]}Mothership{color[ffff]} is moving in on my egg basket!

Coop_InGame_EvtDozer_First	Here comes a {color[0100]}Griller{color[ffff]}. Aim for its exposed tail. They say\nit's what's inside that matters, right? Same here.

Coop_InGame_EvtNone_Start_WaterLow	A {color[0100]}school of Salmonids{color[ffff]} is swarming down at the\n{color[0100]}shoreline{color[ffff]}. Group up and bring 'em down.
Coop_InGame_Boss_Start_Giant_00	That is a {color[0100]}Cohozuna{color[ffff]}. Now, don't get squished by it, or\nthat's going in your file. Oh, and it'll splat you too.
Coop_Tutorial_First_00	Lesson One:\nOn-the-Job Basics
Coop_Tutorial_First_01	Alright, rookie. Listen up. Vicious, unfeeling {color[0100]}Salmonids{color[ffff]}\nwill approach from the water.
Coop_Tutorial_First_02	Your job is to splat 'em with ink to make them drop\ntheir {color[0100]}Power Eggs{color[ffff]}.
Coop_Tutorial_First_03	As a Grizzco Industries employee, you are contractually\nobligated to collect as many {color[0100]}Power Eggs{color[ffff]} as possible.
Coop_Tutorial_ZakoAppear	Let's begin. Find those {color[0100]}Salmonids{color[ffff]}!
Coop_Tutorial_ZakoDefeat	You just got some {color[0100]}Power Eggs{color[ffff]} for splatting that\nSalmonid. I'm counting on you to collect as many\nof those as you can.
Coop_Tutorial_SquadAppear	BACK TO WORK! Go harvest some more {color[0100]}Power Eggs{color[ffff]}.
Coop_Tutorial_SquadDefeat	Hm... Not too bad, kid. You have middle management\nwritten all over you.
Coop_Tutorial_RareAppear_00	The most important part of your job is to harvest\n{color[0100]}Golden Eggs{color[ffff]}. Only {color[0100]}Boss Salmonids {color[ffff]}have those.
Coop_Tutorial_RareAppear_01	Ah, right on cue! A {color[0100]}Boss Salmonid{color[ffff]} just appeared.\nGo hunt it down.
Coop_Tutorial_Ikura_00	Mmm... Yes. The Boss Salmonid dropped its perfect\n{color[0100]}Golden Eggs{color[ffff]}. Touch one to pick it up.
Coop_Tutorial_Ikura_01	Grizzco is a results-based organization. If you don't hit\nthe Golden Egg {color[0100]}quota{color[ffff]} each round, you're finished.
Coop_Tutorial_Ikura_02	OK. Grab one of those Golden Eggs.
Coop_Tutorial_Ikura_Already	Already got one, eh? You work quick and clean—\na gifted go-getter!
Coop_Tutorial_Bank_01	All Golden Eggs should be taken straight to\nthe {color[0100]}egg basket{color[ffff]}.
Coop_Tutorial_Norma_00	That's one egg down. Your quota is three, so you need\nto get two more.
Coop_Tutorial_Norma_01	Just head back and grab the other two e—\nHUH?!
Coop_Tutorial_Bagman_00	That filthy Salmonid is stealing Golden Eggs!\nLooks like they came flying out of the ocean.
Coop_Tutorial_Bagman_01	THAT SLIMY THIEF JUST STOLE MY EGGS! Next time that\nhappens, splat it before it gets back to the water!
Coop_Tutorial_SecondIkura_Pick	GRRR... Go find me some more Golden Eggs.
Coop_Tutorial_SecondIkura_ComeOn	Huh? It sounds like one of your coworkers\nis calling you. Go see what they want.
Coop_Tutorial_SecondIkura_Picked	Mmm... Another sweet little egg. Communicating with\nyour coworkers is an essential part of egg collection.
Coop_Tutorial_SecondIkura_Help	Looks like another one of your coworkers is down.\nSpray 'em with ink to revive 'em.
Coop_Tutorial_SecondIkura_HelpPost_00	Always help your coworkers when they're in need.\nIf your {color[0100]}entire crew gets taken out{color[ffff]}, you're finished.
Coop_Tutorial_SecondIkura_HelpPost_01	Press {[030e|295c4f3f00000000]} to {color[0100]}rally your coworkers{color[ffff]} or {color[0100]}ask them\nfor help{color[ffff]}.
Coop_Tutorial_SecondIkura_Bank	Now take the Golden Egg back to the egg basket.
Coop_Tutorial_Timer_00	You've collected two Golden Eggs. Just one more to\nfulfill your quota.
Coop_Tutorial_Timer_01	You're always on the clock, so you have to hit your\nquota before {color[0100]}time runs out{color[ffff]}.
Coop_Tutorial_ThirdIkura_Pick	Let's find one more Golden Egg, and then I'll let you\nclock out.
Coop_Tutorial_Ikura_Throw_00	If you're a long walk from the egg basket, carrying\nGolden Eggs all that way can eat up time...
Coop_Tutorial_Ikura_Throw_01	Instead, press {[0300|0000803f00000000]} to use some ink to {color[0100]}throw your\nGolden Egg{color[ffff]}. Convenient, right?
Coop_Tutorial_Ikura_Throw_02	You'll be low on ink afterward, so think carefully about\nwhen and where you use it.
Coop_Tutorial_ThirdIkura_Bank	Now, get a Golden Egg in that basket already!\nDon't forget you can throw 'em with {[0300|0000803f00000000]}.
Coop_Tutorial_NormaClear_00	Three Golden Eggs. You've met your quota. Good work.
Coop_Tutorial_NormaClear_01	Now just stay alive until the end of your shift...\nOr, if you want a bonus, you can collect even more\nGolden Eggs and surpass your quota.
Coop_Tutorial_Special	Oh, and I've also arranged for two uses of your\n{color[0100]}special ability {color[ffff]}while you work. Try not to waste 'em.
Coop_Tutorial_WaveClear_00	OK, let's call that enough training for now. Time to get\nyou back to the chopper.
Coop_Tutorial_Failed_00	You didn't meet your quota in time.
Coop_Tutorial_Failed_01	Might have to reconsider your future with Grizzco...
Coop_Tutorial_Failed_02	Ha! Just messin' with you. I'll let it slide this time.
Coop_Tutorial_Rescue_00	If you get splatted by a Salmonid or fall in the water,\nyou'll wind up in a {color[0100]}life ring{color[ffff]}. That's bad, in case you\ncouldn't guess.
Coop_Tutorial_Rescue_01	To get out of the life ring, one of your coworkers has\nto revive you with their ink.
Coop_Tutorial_Rescue_02	I'll revive you this time...but it's coming out of\nyour paycheck.
Coop_Tutorial_Targets_00	Lesson Two:\nThe Not Basics
Coop_Tutorial_Targets_01	There are lots of different kinds of {color[0100]}Boss Salmonid{color[ffff]} out\nthere—{color[0100]}11 kinds{color[ffff]}, to be exact...
Coop_Tutorial_Targets_02	I can lure in a Boss Salmonid if you want. Just tell me\nwhich one you'd like to practice on.
Coop_Tutorial_Targets_03	Alright, what kind should I lure in?
Coop_Tutorial_Enemy_PickIkura	OK. Grab one of those Golden Eggs.
Coop_Tutorial_Enemy_BankIkura	Go put the egg in the basket.
Coop_Tutorial_DeadSkip_00	You're having a tough time with this one, huh?\nFine—I'll take care of it.
Coop_Tutorial_Bomber_00	Boss Salmonid: {color[0100]}Steelhead{color[ffff]}
Coop_Tutorial_Bomber_01	This overgrown appetizer has armor all over its giant,\nslimy body. It also lobs giant, smelly {color[0100]}bombs{color[ffff]}.
Coop_Tutorial_Bomber_02	Shoot the {color[0100]}bomb on its head{color[ffff]} as it expands to pop it\nearly and cook the Steelhead in its own juices.
Coop_Tutorial_Cup_00	Boss Salmonid: {color[0100]}Flyfish{color[ffff]}
Coop_Tutorial_Cup_01	This glorified mosquito flies through the air in an\nink-powered aircraft, launching {color[0100]}missile barrages{color[ffff]}.
Coop_Tutorial_Cup_02	{color[0100]}Toss a bomb{color[ffff]} into both of its missile launchers to take\nit down from the inside out.
Coop_Tutorial_Snake_00	Boss Salmonid: {color[0100]}Steel Eel{color[ffff]}
Coop_Tutorial_Snake_01	This giant eel thing is actually a vehicle piloted by a\ntiny Salmonid. Don't let it touch you, or it's lights out.
Coop_Tutorial_Snake_02	The slimy pilot is sitting in the tail end.\nSneak behind to take it out!
Coop_Tutorial_Tower_00	Boss Salmonid: {color[0100]}Stinger{color[ffff]}
Coop_Tutorial_Tower_01	This spineless sniper sits on top of a tower,\ntaking dirty potshots at you from the shoreline.
Coop_Tutorial_Tower_02	Attack the {color[0100]}stack of dirty cooking pots{color[ffff]} to cut this\nbaddie down to size. When all the pots are done,\nthe Stinger will be too.
Coop_Tutorial_Diver_00	Boss Salmonid: {color[0100]}Maws{color[ffff]}
Coop_Tutorial_Diver_01	This bottom-feeding mouth breather follows its prey\nwhile submerged in ink, then suddenly leaps out and\nswallows them whole.
Coop_Tutorial_Diver_02	One strategy for taking down Maws is to {color[0100]}place a bomb{color[ffff]}\non the spot it'll appear so it chews on that instead\nof you.
Coop_Tutorial_Shield_00	Boss Salmonid: {color[0100]}Scrapper{color[ffff]}
Coop_Tutorial_Shield_01	This lily-livered coward covers its frail body in {color[0100]}shields{color[ffff]}\nmade of cookware and putters forward, making it a\ntough enemy to take out.
Coop_Tutorial_Shield_02	The trick is to get behind it, either by distracting it or\nattacking it until it's stunned.
Coop_Tutorial_Rocket_00	Boss Salmonid: {color[0100]}Drizzler{color[ffff]}
Coop_Tutorial_Rocket_01	This scaly scuzznuzzler fires torpedoes that create\nclouds that rain ink. When it's under its umbrella, your\nattacks can't hurt it.
Coop_Tutorial_Rocket_02	Take your shot when the Drizzler peeks out from\nunder its umbrella. You can also hit its rockets to\n{color[0100]}knock them back{color[ffff]}.
Coop_Tutorial_Pillar_00	Boss Salmonid: {color[0100]}Fish Stick{color[ffff]}
Coop_Tutorial_Pillar_01	These screwy Salmonids plant a {color[0100]}pillar{color[ffff]} in the ground,\nthen fly in circles around the top and spray ink all over.
Coop_Tutorial_Pillar_02	Climb up there and splat them all. {color[0100]}The pillar will stick\naround{color[ffff]} once they're gone, so put it to good use.
Coop_Tutorial_Dolphin_00	Boss Salmonid: {color[0100]}Flipper-Flopper{color[ffff]}
Coop_Tutorial_Dolphin_01	This one throws out an ink ring, then {color[0100]}dives{color[ffff]} into it. Do\nNOT get caught inside the ring, or... Well, you'll see.
Coop_Tutorial_Dolphin_02	Cover the ring in your own ink before it can dive.\nThat'll leave it flopping out in the open. Splat it!
Coop_Tutorial_Saucer_00	Boss Salmonid: {color[0100]}Slammin' Lid{color[ffff]}
Coop_Tutorial_Saucer_01	OK, these ones ride on a flying machine that makes\n{color[0100]}force fields{color[ffff]}. Walk under it, and it'll try to squash you!
Coop_Tutorial_Saucer_02	But! If it tries to squash you, and you dodge, you can\nclimb on top of it and take out the pilot!
Coop_Tutorial_Artillery_00	Boss Salmonid: {color[0100]}Big Shot{color[ffff]}
Coop_Tutorial_Artillery_01	This crafty cannoneer sets up a {color[0100]}Big Shot launcher {color[ffff]}on\nthe shore to fire cannonballs brought in from the sea.\nJust {color[0100]}jump{color[ffff]} over the shock waves from the cannonballs.
Coop_Tutorial_Artillery_02	If you're hauling a Golden Egg and you're near the\n{color[0100]}Big Shot launcher{color[ffff]}, try pressing {[0300|0000803f00000000]}. That'll launch\nthe egg toward the egg basket.
Coop_Tutorial_WaveClear_01	Nice work. That wraps up your training.
Coop_Tutorial_WaveClear_Nobody	Oh, you want to cut your training short? I like your\nenthusiasm. Consider it done!
Coop_Result_C1_Success_00	Let's see here... You harvested {[0200|00010000]} Golden Eggs\nthis time. Nice—that's a good haul.
Coop_Result_C1_Success_Boss_00	Great work on that King Salmonid situation. It's like\nI always say—{color[0100]}trust the sea{color[ffff]} and profits will follow!\nYes, I always say that.
Coop_Result_C1_Success_Many_00	So many eggs! The sea provides, and {color[0100]}it must LOVE you{color[ffff]}!\nRemind me to put that in your next review.
Coop_Result_C1_Success_Master_00	Color me impressed. You are a true {color[0100]}Profreshional{color[ffff]}!\nI can see how much you {color[0100]}love the sea{color[ffff]}!
Coop_Result_C1_Success_Legend_00	Spend enough time out there, and you become one with\n{color[0100]}the sea itself{color[ffff]}! If that doesn't make you {color[0100]}Eggsecutive VP{color[ffff]}\nmaterial, I don't know what does!
Coop_Result_C1_Success_Legend_Boss_00	Wow! You took down a King Salmonid. Never thought I'd\nsay this, but you're {color[0100]}scarier{color[ffff]} than the sea!
Coop_Result_C1_Success_Legend_Many_00	Outstanding! No notes. Just outstanding. In fact,\nI'd say the {color[0100]}sea's got itself a new{color[ffff]} {color[0100]}legend{color[ffff]} for folks\nto hear about!
Coop_Result_C1_Success_DifficultyMax_00	You...finished the job? At {color[0100]}hazard level 333%{color[ffff]}? Forget\nthe sea—you could best even the {color[0100]}boundless cosmos{color[ffff]}...\nThat's like the sea, except bigger.
Coop_Result_C1_Failure_AllDead_00	Crew wipe, eh? Well, let's see how you did... You got {[0200|00010000]}.\nNot terrible.
Coop_Result_C1_Failure_TimeUp_00	TIME'S UP! At least you tried. Let's count those\nGolden Eggs... Just {[0200|00010000]}? Eh, better than nothing.
Coop_Result_C1_Failure_Boss_AllDead_00	That must've been terrifying... If you're going to have\nnightmares, policy requires that you do it off the clock.
Coop_Result_C1_Failure_Boss_TimeUp_00	Didn't expect a King Salmonid... Thanks for sticking\naround, everyone!
Coop_Result_C1_Failure_GoldenIkura0_00	You couldn't even grab ONE Golden Egg? GRRR... Guess I\nshould have made you read the handbook.
Coop_Result_C2_Success_00	THAT'S what I like to see! You've got a future here, kid.\nThis'll go in your performance eval.
Coop_Result_C2_Success_RareWeapon_00	Notice that fancy weapon you had there? That's one of\nmy special models. How'd it feel?
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_WaterLow_00	Low tide gives you more room to work, but that makes\nit easy to get separated. Salmonids will surround you\nbefore you know it, so don't wander off alone.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_WaterHigh_00	Salmonids can overrun your workplace in a flash at\nhigh tide. Watch each other's backs out there.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_00	Salmonids can't climb walls. Ink some walls ahead of\ntime for shortcuts when things go belly-up.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_01	Salmonids tend to come at you from one direction all at\nonce, but that direction is liable to change over time.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_02	If you're far from the egg basket, you can throw your\nGolden Egg with {[0300|0000803f00000000]}. A coworker near the basket\nmight snag and dunk it for you.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_03	If you try to hide in your own ink, the Salmonids WILL\nfind you. Those suckers have a wicked sense of smell...
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_04	Throwing a Golden Egg uses ink. If Salmonids have you\nsurrounded, think twice before you throw.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_05	If there's a Snatcher near the egg basket, you can use\nthat to your advantage.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_06	Different weapons work better on different Salmonids,\nso pick your targets carefully. Efficiency equals profit!
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_07	Always put Boss Salmonids at the top of your task list.\nIf there's a lot of 'em, start with the biggest threat and\nwork your way down.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_SakelienBomber_00	Don't go up against a Steelhead with a short-range\nweapon unless you wanna get splatted. Long-range\nweapons like chargers are the way to go!
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_SakelienCupTwins_00	When lobbing bombs at a Flyfish, don't lose your cool.\nLook for a safe place with good line of sight.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_SakelienSnake_00	A Steel Eel never gives up on its target. Try to lead\nit on a wild squid chase, or use teamwork to beat it.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_SakelienTower_00	Move side to side to dodge a Stinger's attacks.\nAnd if you see a coworker under attack by one,\nget over there and take it out!
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_Sakediver_00	You can take out Maws in no time if you make it swallow\na bomb. Try to keep a bomb's worth of ink in your tank\nso you can throw one at any moment.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_SakelienShield_00	When you stop a Scrapper by blasting it, try to keep its\nlocation and the direction it's facing in mind.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_Sakerocket_00	Shoot a Drizzler's torpedoes to send them right back.\nThat's a surefire way to bring one down in a snap.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_SakePillar_00	Try to ink a Fish Stick's sides as soon as you spot it.\nA Squid Surge will make it easy to climb to the top.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_SakeDolphin_00	Flipper-Floppers are easy to beat if you ink their rings.\nIf your ink's low, withdraw, regroup, and try again.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_SakeSaucer_00	Get the Slammin' Lid to drop, then hop on top of it. And\nif you can make it squash a few Salmonids along the\nway, even better!
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_SakeArtillery_00	From the suggestion box: "Put a Golden Egg into\na Big Shot's launcher to fire it toward the egg basket."\nGood advice!
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_Rush_00	If you get swarmed by Glowflies...well, good luck.\nOnce they're on you, every Salmonid in the area\nwill try to splat you.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_Geyser_00	When you're searching for a Goldie, divide and conquer.\nLook for the gushers that shine the brightest.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_Dozer_00	If you're targeted by a Griller, just RUN. Those jerks\nare hard to beat without help.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_Rally_00	If a Mothership goes for the egg basket, rush to\ndefend it. Do NOT let it steal those Golden Eggs!
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_Fog_00	When the fog rolls in, communication becomes the key\nto survival. Use {[030e|295c4f3f00000000]} to call for your coworkers.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_Missile_00	Use the cannons to fight off the Cohock Charge.\nJust don't forget to keep collecting Golden Eggs!
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_Tamaire_00	It takes teamwork to topple a Mudmouth. And bombs.
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_Relay_00	It's everyone's job to get Golden Eggs into that basket.\nCarrying, passing, depositing... Smart delegation is key!
Coop_Result_C2_Failure_Boss_00	At least you got a LOT of Golden Eggs! I can't wait to\nsee how many you'll get next time.

Don't fret!\nYou can always press {[0303|0000803f00000000]} to try\nout my products before buying.
Weapon_First_01	Now then, you do know that you'll\nneed to exchange {[031c|295c4f3f00000000]}{color[0100]}Sheldon\nLicenses {color[ffff]}to walk out of here with\nsomething shiny and new, right?
Weapon_EndCloseUp_00	And you can get {[031c|295c4f3f00000000]}Sheldon Licenses\nby battling and leveling up...or even\njust developing your skills by using\na particular weapon a lot.
Weapon_FirstWithSaveTransfer_00	Hello, hello! Let me guess—you're\nlooking for some new weapons?\nYou've come to the right place!{[0004]}Hold the phone... What is THAT?!\nI didn't know you were a collector of\nvintage weapons! I must say—it's\nfascinating, but you'll need something\nfar fresher for the Splatlands.
Weapon_FirstWithSaveTransfer_01	Of course, before you walk out of\nhere with something shiny and new,\nyou're aware you'll need the correct\n{[031c|295c4f3f00000000]}{color[0100]}Sheldon License{color[ffff]}, yes?
Weapon_EndCloseUpWithSaveTransfer_00	And you can get {[031c|295c4f3f00000000]}Sheldon Licenses\nby battling and leveling up...or even\njust developing your skills by using\na particular weapon a lot.{[0004]}AH! You've surprised me yet again.\nYou already have at least one\n{[031d|295c4f3f00000000]}{color[0100]}Gold Sheldon License{color[ffff]}?!

Weapon_Offline_00	Hello, he— {[0004]}Oh... You seem to be offline. Come\nback when you're connected to the\n{color[0100]}internet{color[ffff]}. You can get connected by\nvisiting the lobby!
Weapon_RankShortage_00	Hello, he— Oh my, is that truly the\nonly weapon in your possession?{[0004]}I would love to talk your tentacles\noff about the stuff I've got in stock,\nbut I'm not sure you can handle the\nsheer firepower at lowly level 1.{[0004]}Listen—I've got a plan, and it will\nwork. Go to the {color[0100]}lobby {color[ffff]}and play some\n{color[0100]}Regular Battles{color[ffff]}. Get to...let's say...\n{color[0100]}level 2{color[ffff]}. Then come back and see me!
Weapon_License_00	Hm...judging by your current {color[0100]}level{color[ffff]},\nthat weapon is a little too spicy for\nyou. But maybe there's a way around\nthis somehow...{[0004]}I suppose if you simply MUST HAVE\nIT, you could trade {color[0100]}3{color[ffff]} {[031c|295c4f3f00000000]}Sheldon\nLicenses for it right now!
Weapon_GoldLicense_00	Hm...judging by your current {color[0100]}level{color[ffff]},\nthat weapon is a little too spicy for\nyou. But maybe there's a way around\nthis somehow...{[0004]}I suppose if you simply MUST HAVE\nIT, I could let you trade {color[0100]}1 {color[ffff]}{[031d|295c4f3f00000000]}Gold\nSheldon License for it right now!
Weapon_GoldLicenseConfirm_00	Oh, this is unfortunate. You don't\nhave any {[031c|295c4f3f00000000]}Sheldon Licenses right\nnow. You do have {color[0100]}1{color[ffff]} {[031d|295c4f3f00000000]}Gold Sheldon\nLicense, and I can accept that, but...{[0004]}It seems like it would be a waste.\nAre you sure you want to use your\n{[031d|295c4f3f00000000]}Gold Sheldon License on that?
Weapon_LowRankS	Price: 1 {[031c|0000803f00000000]} @ Lv. {[0200|00020000]}

Weapon_ThankYou_00	Thank you! I know you'll give it a\ngood home. Remember—you can equip\nnew weapons in the {[0305|0000803f00000000]}{color[0100]}Equip {color[ffff]}menu.

Head_RarityMaxS	Bright lights, baby!
Head_BasicSkillSame_00	Uh...I'm not sure I understand what\nyou're doing. Those two items have,\nlike, the same primary abilities...

Head_SoldOutS	Business is boomin'!
Head_ExpRarityUpAndReplace_00	Oh, hey...there's a complicated new\nthing you can do that I gotta tell\nyou about. Um...{[0004]}So we have an item that's the same\nas one you already own.

It's like hitting the reset\nbutton on its abilities. Whoa. I guess\nit wasn't that complicated.
Head_RarityUp_00	Oh, so, like...you already have that\nitem. Did you want to {color[0100]}raise its star\npower{color[ffff]} or {color[0100]}trade in your old one{color[ffff]}?
Head_ReplaceConfirm_00	So, your item's {color[0100]}secondary gear\nabilities{color[ffff]} and {color[0100]}star power{color[ffff]} will be reset.\nYour head fully wrapped around that?
Head_ThankYou_00	Sounds good... Enjoy your new gear.\nIf you wanna change your setup, just\ncheck out the {[0305|0000803f00000000]}{color[0100]}Equip {color[ffff]}menu, OK?

So we got you an even more\nexclusive {color[0100]}badge{color[ffff]}.{[0004]}It would be pretty cool if you showed\nit off sometime. But y'know...no\npressure, or anything.

Clothes_WelcomeRank10_00	Ah, you are here. Good. Welcome to\nMan-o'-Wardrobe.{[0004]}You think I haven't noticed? That you\nhave attained level 10? I NOTICE ALL!\nDo not think that you have become so\nfresh that our clothing cannot make\nyou fresher yet!

Clothes_MoneyShortage_00	...Are you testing Jel La Fleur's\npatience? You do not have enough\ncash for this transaction!
Clothes_RarityMax_00	No, no, no, no, no. The item in\nquestion already has maximum star\npower. How could you want more?
Clothes_BasicSkillSame_00	No, no, no, no, no. The item in\nquestion already has the same\nprimary gear ability. Trading in\nyour item in this case has no\nmeaning. No function, no fashion!
Clothes_SoldOut_00	You're in need of a duplicate?\nPerhaps I should not complain.\nBut perhaps this is a mistake.
Clothes_ExpRarityUpAndReplace_00	Ah, now we encounter what I call\na "fashion conundrum." You will\nhave a choice to make...{[0004]}When clothing that you already own\nis in stock, you can {color[0100]}raise its star\npower{color[ffff]} or {color[0100]}trade in{color[ffff]} your clothing\nto reset its abilities.{[0004]}So? What say you? In this matter,\nJel La Fleur cannot advise you.
Clothes_RarityUp_00	An opportunity presents itself.\nWill you {color[0100]}raise the star power{color[ffff]} of\nyour clothing, or {color[0100]}trade it in{color[ffff]} to\nreset the abilities?
Clothes_ReplaceConfirm_00	I offer now this reminder. You will\nreset the {color[0100]}star power{color[ffff]} and {color[0100]}abilities{color[ffff]}\nif you do this. Are you sure?
Clothes_ThankYou_00	Very well. Now then, if you wish to\nchange clothes, you must open the\n{[0305|0000803f00000000]}{color[0100]}Equip{color[ffff]} menu.
Clothes_ThankYouButFestT_00	Thank you very much. But you\ncannot change clothes now—we\nare in the middle of a Splatfest.\nIT SIMPLY ISN'T DONE.
Clothes_ThanksBadgeA_00	Ahem. There is something I should\nbring to your attention.{[0004]}You have bought many clothes from\nme and worn them with respect and\npanache.

Goods_Welcome_00	...Oh, hey.
Goods_WelcomeS	...Oh, hey.
Goods_WelcomeRankA_00	...Oh, hey. Welcome to Hotlantis.{[0004]}Uhhh, I guess Barry had something\nhe wanted to say to you? He's the\nowner of this shop, obviously.{[0004]}Anyway, he said you were really fresh\nor something. Then he did, like, a\nweird dance that's supposed to mean\nsomething? I don't know. I think he's\nlooking for more stuff to sell you.
Goods_WelcomeRankB_00	...Oh, hey. Welcome to Hotlantis.{[0004]}Oh yeah, Barry the owner had\nanother message for you.{[0004]}I am NOT going to make a heart\nsymbol with my hands like he told me\nto, but...he said something to the\neffect of, "You're a great customer"\nand, "Please keep coming back."{[0004]}Then he said, "Yo," like, 30 times\nin a row, and I think he was doing\na different dance. Not sure if I was\nsupposed to tell you that part.
Goods_First_00	...Oh, hey. Welcome to Hotlantis.{[0004]}I don't really work here, but you can\nshop around, and I'll sell you stuff.{[0004]}Don't ask me what to do with any\nof it. Put it in your {color[0100]}locker{color[ffff]}, I guess?\nIt's all pretty random. You'll see.
Goods_First_01	Uh, your {color[0100]}locker {color[ffff]}is in the {color[0100]}locker room{color[ffff]}.\nDuh. You can go look at it later.{[0004]}If there's anything in there, I guess\nit's yours by default.
Goods_FirstCatalog_00	Oh, and I'm supposed to give you\none of these. It's a {color[0100]}catalog{color[ffff]}.
Goods_FirstReward_00	Do you do battles and work shifts\nat Grizzco and stuff? I guess you\nget {color[0100]}Catalog Points{color[ffff]} for doing things\nlike that.{[0004]}And then every time your {color[0100]}catalog level{color[ffff]}\ngoes up, you get a prize. And I get to\ndig through all this stuff to find it\nand give it to you. Yay.{[0004]}Anyway, let's get the first one out\nof the way right now. Your very first\nprize. Cherish it.
Goods_FirstRewardAfter_00	OK...I'll let you get back to shopping\nor whatever.
Goods_NewReward_00	Oh. Your catalog level went up.\nWell, here's your reward.
Goods_NewRewardAfter_00	Keep up the good...work? Is it work?\nWhatever. Keep doing it.
Goods_ExchangeCatalog_00	Oh. You got everything in that\ncatalog? Uh, wow!{[0004]}Well, uh...here's a new one.
Goods_ExchangeCatalogAfter_00	Keep trucking. Ugh, you're definitely\nnot trucking. Just keep after it.
Goods_Offline_00	...Oh, hey. Welcome to Hotlantis.{[0004]}Ughhh, you're offline. I get it.\nGonna need you to plug back in\nto the {color[0100]}internet {color[ffff]}if you wanna buy\nstuff though. Try the {color[0100]}lobby{color[ffff]}.
Goods_RankShortage_00	...Oh, hey. Welcome to Hotlanti—\nWait. I take it back. Not yet.{[0004]}You have to be {color[0100]}level 4{color[ffff]} to shop here.\nI don't make the rules. Just go to\nthe {color[0100]}lobby {color[ffff]}and do a few {color[0100]}Turf War\nbattles{color[ffff]} or whatever, OK?
Goods_BuyS	How many?
Goods_MoneyShortage_00	Uh, but that's not enough cash?
Goods_SoldOut_00	Oh. Sold out. Sorry.
Goods_ThankYou_00	Cool, thanks. I, uh, hope your locker\nis looking really fresh, or something.
Goods_ThanksBadgeA_00	Oh. Hey. You've bought a lot of\nstuff from this place...{[0004]}Barry had a special message for that.{[0004]}He wanted me to thank you for being\nsuch a loyal customer.{[0004]}Then he had this whole bit where I'm\nsupposed to give a "funny" speech\nand present you with a {color[0100]}badge{color[ffff]}...{[0004]}I'm just gonna give this to you.\nWay to consume, consumer.
Goods_ThanksBadgeB_00	Oh. Hey. You've bought a LOOOT of\nstuff from this place...{[0004]}Barry had another message for this.{[0004]}He wanted me to get super sappy if a\nregular customer became a super-big\nspender here. Like you. So congrats\non...buying a lot of stuff. You did it.{[0004]}Then he wanted me to do another\n{color[0100]}badge{color[ffff]} ceremony with a handshake,\npublicity photos, singing a parody\nsong that he wrote himself...{[0004]}So anyway...here. Badge. Ta-daaa.
CommonMsg\Talk\TalkShopWeaponExp.msbt
Shooter_Short_00	With its wide muzzle, the\n{color[0100]}Sploosh-o-matic{color[ffff]} is well suited\nfor close-combat situations.{[0004]}And escorting you to those close-\ncombat situations is the {color[0100]}Curling\nBomb{color[ffff]}! Let one loose, and it'll lay\ndown a proverbial red carpet to\nyour foes' feet.{[0004]}Combined with the {color[0100]}Ultra Stamp{color[ffff]}'s\nforward rush, you have one powerful\nsetup for players who love getting up\nclose and personal—or who want to\nblaze a path forward for their allies.
Shooter_Precision_00	For your main weapon, I present the\n{color[0100]}Splash-o-matic{color[ffff]}, a weapon fine-tuned\nfor highly accurate barrages!{[0004]}It may not have the ink spread or\nraw power of some weapons, but\nit more than makes up for it with\nrapid fire that is quite rapid indeed.{[0004]}Plus, when you can pin down an\nenemy with {color[0100]}Burst Bombs{color[ffff]}, you don't\nneed as much power. Simply splatter\nthem at your leisure while they're\nmired in your ink.{[0004]}And with the {color[0100]}Crab Tank {color[ffff]}special in\nyour back pocket, nothing can\nstand in your way! Try not to laugh\nmaniacally as you overpower the\nother team time and again.
Shooter_Blaze_00	The range and accuracy of the\n{color[0100]}Aerospray MG{color[ffff]} aren't anything to write\nhome about, but break out a pen and\nsome stationery for its rate of fire!{[0004]}And when you pair a nimble weapon\nlike that with {color[0100]}Fizzy Bombs{color[ffff]}, it makes\nmovement a breeze. You can quickly\nlock down plenty of turf to help\nsupport your teammates.{[0004]}Of course, inking turf is the name\nof the game, but sometimes you\nneed a little extra OOMPH, and that's\nwhere the {color[0100]}Reefslider {color[ffff]}special comes\nin. Ride it to glorious victory!{[0004]}This setup is ideal for players who\nlike to mix it up—tactically pushing\nthe front line and waiting for the\nright moment to go big.
Shooter_Normal_00	The {color[0100]}Splattershot{color[ffff]} is beloved for its\nease of handling and high potential.\nThis is the latest model of the\ngo-to weapon!{[0004]}Paired with {color[0100]}Suction Bombs{color[ffff]}, you have\na wonderfully stable loadout that\nallows you to respond to whatever\nthe enemy throws at you.{[0004]}And let's not forget the {color[0100]}Trizooka{color[ffff]}\nspecial. Let one off the leash at\nthe right moment, and I guarantee\nyour opponent won't forget!{[0004]}Is this setup a little basic? Yes!\nBasically one of the best setups you\ncan have! Master the fundamentals,\nand you'll become a force to be\nreckoned with.
Shooter_Gravity_00	The {color[0100]}.52 Gal{color[ffff]} is a heavy hitter with\nan extra-large nozzle for shooting\nmassive amounts of ink.{[0004]}Of course, all that power comes at\nthe expense of fire rate...which is\nwhy you'll want the {color[0100]}Splash Wall {color[ffff]}to\nhide behind while reloading.{[0004]}And if the other team is playing it\na little too safe, you've always got\nthe {color[0100]}Killer Wail 5.1{color[ffff]}. Lock on and blast\n'em with lasers!{[0004]}So if you're the type to hang back\nand wait for just the right moment,\nthis loadout is for you.
Shooter_QuickMiddle_00	The {color[0100]}N-ZAP '85{color[ffff]} is a shooter with\nexcellent ink efficiency and\nrapid-fire capability!{[0004]}And, um...its power is certainly...\nadequate. Sorry—I hate to say\nanything negative, but this weapon\ndoesn't pack the biggest punch.{[0004]}But that's OK! It's fast enough to\nsend your enemies scrambling...and\nthat's when you hit 'em with the\n{color[0100]}Suction Bombs{color[ffff]}.{[0004]}Fire up the {color[0100]}Tacticooler {color[ffff]}to energize\nyour squad for a big push, and you've\ngot a nimble loadout that's built for\nteamwork. It's what makes the\ndream work!
Shooter_Expert_00	The {color[0100]}Splattershot Pro{color[ffff]} was developed\nfor more advanced users by the\nsame team that brought you the\nSplattershot!{[0004]}And here's a "pro" strategy for using\nit—deploy the {color[0100]}Angle Shooter {color[ffff]}to limit\nyour opponent's movement, then take\nadvantage of the Pro's accuracy and\nrange to splat 'em from downtown.{[0004]}Of course, sometimes you just want\nto crush your enemies with a\ncrustacean, and that's where the\n{color[0100]}Crab Tank {color[ffff]}comes in.{[0004]}Putting it all together is easier said\nthan done, but this setup is built\nfor players who dare to dream.
Shooter_Heavy_00	The {color[0100]}.96 Gal{color[ffff]} is a shooter that hits\nhard and has a long range, courtesy\nof its large chamber and extended\nbarrel!{[0004]}This thing would be an absolute\ncheat code if it fired just a little\nfaster...but you can't have your\ncrab cake and eat it too. You have\nto make each shot count!{[0004]}Still, you can set up a {color[0100]}Sprinkler {color[ffff]}to\nhelp secure your turf...and the\n{color[0100]}Ink Vac {color[ffff]}special doesn't suck. I mean,\nit DOES, but...you know what I mean!
Shooter_Long_00	The {color[0100]}Jet Squelcher {color[ffff]}has boosted pump\npressure to give it a range that\nrivals charger weapons!{[0004]}Like other weapons with extreme\nrange, it doesn't offer much in the\nway of power. But when combined\nwith the {color[0100]}Angle Shooter {color[ffff]}sub, your\nenemies won't know what hit 'em.\nBecause you'll be SO far away!\nAdd the {color[0100]}Ink Vac {color[ffff]}to the mix to suck\nup incoming offensives, and you have\na loadout that's perfect for cool,\ncalculating players who play it safe.
Blaster_Short_00	The {color[0100]}Luna Blaster{color[ffff]} may look cute, but\nits short-range exploding ink shots\npack a serious wallop.{[0004]}If you find that your enemies are\ndancing just outside that range,\ntoss a few {color[0100]}Splat Bombs {color[ffff]}to keep 'em\non their toes.{[0004]}And for the ones sniping you from\nFAR away, fire up the {color[0100]}Zipcaster{color[ffff]},\nsneak behind 'em, and...well, you\nknow what to do from there.{[0004]}Really, this set is ideal for players\nwho want to read the terrain and\nreact to their opponents' moves.
Blaster_Middle_00	What can I say about the {color[0100]}Blaster{color[ffff]}\nother than...it blasts. HARD.\nWhen those balls of ink explode,\nthey can even tag enemies hiding\nbehind walls.{[0004]}Now, the range isn't great, and the\nrate of fire leaves a little to be\ndesired, but you can always coax\nan enemy out of hiding with an\n{color[0100]}Autobomb{color[ffff]}, can't you?{[0004]}On the other hand, if you're getting\ncharged, that's when it's time to\nbreak out the {color[0100]}Big Bubbler{color[ffff]}.{[0004]}Basically, if YOU want to be the\none controlling the action, this\nis the loadout for you.
Blaster_Long_00	The {color[0100]}Range Blaster{color[ffff]} delays the\noxidization of ink, which extends\nthe range before it explodes.{[0004]}Let that sink in. It's SO COOL how\nit works! Of course, you lose a\nlittle fire rate, but that's OK when\nyou have {color[0100]}Suction Bombs{color[ffff]} to flush\nout your opponents.{[0004]}And with the {color[0100]}Wave Breaker {color[ffff]}at your\ndisposal to reveal their positions,\nit's almost like your enemies will\nhave nowhere to hide!{[0004]}I recommend this loadout to anyone\nwho fancies themselves a master\nof the hunt.
Blaster_LightShort_00	You know how blasters tend to have\na low rate of fire? Not the {color[0100]}Clash\nBlaster{color[ffff]}! Its speedy shots are great\nfor keeping foes at bay!{[0004]}Now, it's not going to win any awards\nfor power, but when you have {color[0100]}Splat\nBombs{color[ffff]} to corner your enemies, it'll\nget the job done.{[0004]}And if an opponent still manages to\nslip away? That's when you trash\n'em with the {color[0100]}Trizooka{color[ffff]}. Talk about\na chaotic combo. If that sounds fun,\nthis loadout is for you!
Blaster_Light_00	The {color[0100]}Rapid Blaster{color[ffff]} lives up to its\nname with an improved rate of fire\nand modest ink consumption.{[0004]}Now, if you know me at all, you know\nI'm going to tell you about a big\ntrade-off, and it's this: low power.\nBut using the {color[0100]}Ink Mine {color[ffff]}to reveal\nenemy positions helps make up for it.{[0004]}What I'd do with a combo like this is\nuse the Rapid Blaster to create a\nwhirlwind of ink, then take it to the\nnext level with a {color[0100]}Triple Inkstrike{color[ffff]}.{[0004]}This setup lets you focus in on\nkey areas of the map—whether you're\ndefending the home base or pushing\nan advance into hostile territory.
Blaster_LightLong_00	The {color[0100]}Rapid Blaster Pro{color[ffff]} owes its\nincredible range to a chamber system\nthat delays ink oxidization to the last\npossible moment!{[0004]}With that technology in hand, try\ncatching your enemies in a little\n{color[0100]}Toxic Mist {color[ffff]}before giving them a few\ninksplosions as a parting gift.{[0004]}And if anyone gets too close?\nFire up the {color[0100]}Ink Vac{color[ffff]},{color[0100]} {color[ffff]}and turn their\nown inkpower against them! This is\na set that will make the tactically\ninclined player veeery happy.
Shooter_TripleQuick_00	Why fire once when you can fire\nthree times? That's the question\nthat the {color[0100]}L-3 Nozzlenose {color[ffff]}answers.\nOne pull of the trigger launches\nthree rapid shots.{[0004]}Now, don't get me wrong. This isn't\na full-auto weapon. Holding down {[030c|0000803f00000000]}\nis like pressing the "close door"\nbutton in an elevator—it does\nabsolutely nothing!{[0004]}So you'll want to time your triple\nshots perfectly...and wait for the\nright moment to toss a {color[0100]}Curling Bomb{color[ffff]}.\nOr, if a triple shot won't do the trick,\nthere's always the {color[0100]}Crab Tank{color[ffff]}!{[0004]}So who's this set for? Just about\nanyone! It's so balanced that both\nthe freshest noobs and the crustiest\nveterans can find a use for it.
Shooter_TripleMiddle_00	If you like the L-3 Nozzlenose but\nfind it a bit lacking in power...\nenter the {color[0100]}H-3 Nozzlenose{color[ffff]}!{[0004]}The "H" probably stands for "heavy,"\nbut I like to think it stands for\n"HAHAHAHA," which is the noise one\ntypically makes while firing it.{[0004]}Now, the fire rate suffers a bit\ncompared to lighter weapons, but\nwhen you can pinpoint your enemies\nwith a {color[0100]}Point Sensor{color[ffff]}, you can make\neach shot count.{[0004]}And with a team all juiced up on\nenergy from your {color[0100]}Tacticooler{color[ffff]}, you're\nready to laugh all the way to the\nwinner's circle.
Shooter_Flash_00	The {color[0100]}Squeezer {color[ffff]}is a great choice for\nplayers who want flexibility. Pull the\ntrigger once, and you get a single\nhigh-powered shot.{[0004]}But holding down {[030c|0000803f00000000]} {color[0100]}changes\neverything{color[ffff]}! Suddenly the rate of\nfire goes up, and the Squeezer\ntransforms into an absolute\nturf-inking machine.{[0004]}Master both modes, and you'll barely\neven need the {color[0100]}Splash Wall {color[ffff]}to shore\nup your defenses. But it's there for\nyou anyway!{[0004]}And with a {color[0100]}Trizooka {color[ffff]}to tame far-off\nenemies, this set is built for flashy\nfighters who are comfortable being\nthe center of attention.
Roller_Compact_00	The {color[0100]}Carbon Roller{color[ffff]} is a lightweight\nroller built using low-density parts\nfor increased handling!{[0004]}Of course, lightweight leads to\nlight inking capability, but if you\ncan find an opponent with an\n{color[0100]}Autobomb {color[ffff]}and then sneak behind\nthem, it'll get the job done.{[0004]}Rounding out this zippy little loadout\nis the {color[0100]}Zipcaster{color[ffff]}, which can also help\nyou surprise and undelight your\nopponents. Basically, if you want to\nbe a ninja, try out this set!
Roller_Normal_00	The {color[0100]}Splat Roller {color[ffff]}represents the\n{color[0100]}roller{color[ffff]} class of weapons that excel\nat close combat and inking turf.{[0004]}With any roller, you can tap {[030c|0000803f00000000]}\nto fling ink, or hold {[030c|0000803f00000000]} down as\nyou run to lay down a path of\ninky goodness.{[0004]}Try using your {color[0100]}Curling Bombs {color[ffff]}to\nsneak up close to an enemy, and\nthen...PLOOSH! Get 'em with the\nroller. It's oh so satisfying.{[0004]}As an added strategic wrinkle, you\nhave the {color[0100]}Big Bubbler {color[ffff]}to rally your\nteam to the front line at just the\nright moment.{[0004]}If you're new to rollers, I can't\nrecommend this loadout enough.\nWho knows? Maybe you'll become\na roller for life!
Roller_Heavy_00	The {color[0100]}Dynamo Roller{color[ffff]} is a roller I\ndesigned myself using a power\ngenerator for high strength and\nlong range!{[0004]}Now, I wasn't able to reduce the\nweight on the motor as much as I\nwould have liked, but this thing\ncan REALLY spill some ink, if I do\nsay so myself.{[0004]}Pair it with the {color[0100]}Sprinkler {color[ffff]}sub, and\nyou can push forward to apply max\npressure to the other team.{[0004]}And what will your team be doing,\nyou ask? Why, relaxing and enjoying\nsweet, sugary sips from your\n{color[0100]}Tacticooler{color[ffff]}, of course. You'll be the\nmost popular teammate around!
Roller_Hunter_00	The {color[0100]}Flingza Roller{color[ffff]} is a wild one.\nIts shape changes depending on\nwhether you swing it vertically\nor horizontally!{[0004]}I won't get too technical, but the\nautomatic centrifugal clutch allows\nfor light horizontal swings that go\nFLOOSH and heavier vertical swings\nthat are more like GLOMP!{[0004]}The bottom line is that you can\ncontrol the action. Use the vertical\nswing to lay down a path, then take\ndown nearby opponents with the quick\nstrike of a horizontal swing.{[0004]}While you're zipping around, you can\nalso lay down {color[0100]}Ink Mines {color[ffff]}to help sniff\nout opponents and fire off some\n{color[0100]}Tenta Missiles {color[ffff]}for a one-two punch.{[0004]}If you're up to the challenge of\nsimply dominating a match, then\nyou should give this set a try!
Brush_Mini_00	The {color[0100]}Inkbrush{color[ffff]} is a super-light brush\nweapon that lets you ink your way\nforward with blistering speed!{[0004]}There's not much room for power\nwhen you're moving that fast, but\nyou can keep counterattacks at\nbay with plenty of {color[0100]}Splat Bombs{color[ffff]}.{[0004]}Add the {color[0100]}Killer Wail 5.1 {color[ffff]}to the mix,\nand you've got a combo that will\nconfuse and annoy your opponents\ninto submission!{[0004]}I can see it now... You blaze across\nbattle lines...toss a Splat Bomb, and\ntrigger the Killer Wail just in time to\nheadbang along as the clock runs out.\nWhew! That's inking outside the box!
Brush_Normal_00	The {color[0100]}Octobrush{color[ffff]} has dense bristles\nthat fling a thick stream of ink with\neach slash. It's a heavier entry in the\n{color[0100]}brush{color[ffff]} weapon class, which is known\nfor being light and nimble.{[0004]}But even with those heavy brush\nstrokes, you won't be able to reach\neverywhere—and that's where the\n{color[0100]}Suction Bombs {color[ffff]}come in.{[0004]}Lastly, if you're up against enemies\nwith ranged weapons who just won't\nengage up close, you've got the\n{color[0100]}Zipcaster {color[ffff]}in your back pocket. Zip\non over and give 'em what for!{[0004]}This is a user-friendly loadout that's\neasy for beginner brushers but\ncapable enough for true artistes!
Charger_Quick_00	Ah, the {color[0100]}Classic Squiffer{color[ffff]}. For a\ncharger, it's a bit short on range,\nbut in return it can charge up\nmuch more quickly.{[0004]}That allows you to use it in a more\noffensive way! I mean...being on\nthe offense. Not that the weapon is\noffensive...except to your opponents.{[0004]}Anyway, I'd take advantage of the\n{color[0100]}Point Sensor {color[ffff]}sub to coordinate an\nattack with my teammates.{[0004]}And if my home turf was invaded, I'd\ndeploy the {color[0100]}Big Bubbler {color[ffff]}and hide inside,\nusing that Classic Squiffer action to\nsnipe enemies. Comfy in close range\nwith a charger? This set is for you!
Charger_Normal_00	Simply put, the {color[0100]}Splat Charger{color[ffff]} is a\n{color[0100]}charger{color[ffff]}-type weapon designed for\nlong-range offense.{[0004]}Its operation is standard—hold down\n{[030c|0000803f00000000]} to charge up ink, then release\n{[030c|0000803f00000000]} to fire it all out at once, inking\na long path in an instant!{[0004]}Ah, but here's a key difference...the\nSplat Charger can actually {color[0100]}hold its\ncharge{color[ffff]} for a short period while you\nswim. Tactically speaking, that's a\ngame-changing advantage!{[0004]}And with {color[0100]}Splat Bombs {color[ffff]}to flush out\nhiding enemies and the {color[0100]}Ink Vac {color[ffff]}to\nturn the tables on invaders, this set\nis impressively well-balanced.{[0004]}I recommend it for anyone who's\nlooking to eventually master the\ncharger category of weapons!
Charger_NormalScope_00	The {color[0100]}Splatterscope {color[ffff]}is a Splat Charger\nwith an added scope for more\neffective long-distance aiming.{[0004]}It's great for hitting far-off targets,\nbut your view is narrow while\ncharging, so be extra careful!{[0004]}Also, that fancy scope takes up\nspace, so something had to go.\nIn this case, we had to nix the\nability to {color[0100]}store your charge{color[ffff]}.{[0004]}But hey, if you like to stay safe\nand shoot from afar, this could be\nthe charger for you!{[0004]}When you're not scoping and sniping,\nyou've also got {color[0100]}Splat Bombs {color[ffff]}and the\n{color[0100]}Ink Vac {color[ffff]}at your disposal, so this is\na more balanced set than it would\nappear. Give it a try!
Charger_Long_00	With its pressurized polymer\nconstruction, the {color[0100]}E-liter 4K{color[ffff]} has\na remarkably long range, even for\na charger!{[0004]}To get the most out of it, you can\nset {color[0100]}Ink Mines {color[ffff]}for opponents who get\ntoo close, then use the {color[0100]}Wave Breaker{color[ffff]}\nspecial to reveal those who are\nslinking around in the ink.{[0004]}Still, this set is all about long-range\naccuracy, and in the right hands, it\nwill definitely hit the target. I hope\nit goes to a good home!
Charger_LongScope_00	The {color[0100]}E-liter 4K Scope{color[ffff]} delivers the\nlong-range action of the 4K model\nwith a scope for added accuracy!{[0004]}Though it boasts a shot range that\nbeats almost every other charger,\nyou'll want to be extra aware of your\nsurroundings when scoping in.{[0004]}Unlike the E-liter 4K, the scoped\nconfiguration won't let you store a\ncharged shot, so keep that in mind\nas you adjust to the feel of using\na scope.{[0004]}It comes with the same {color[0100]}Ink Mines {color[ffff]}and\n{color[0100]}Wave Breaker {color[ffff]}special as the base\nE-liter 4K, so you can apply the same\nstrategy—stay safe while you zoom\nin and splat unsuspecting foes!
Charger_Light_00	The {color[0100]}Bamboozler 14 Mk I{color[ffff]} is a tribute\nto a weapon used by the leader of\nthe famous Squidbeak Splatoon, but\nretooled for the battles of today!{[0004]}I've used bamboo in my version to\nremain faithful to the original design,\nbut as a trade-off, it {color[0100]}can't store a\ncharged shot{color[ffff]}.{[0004]}Is it the most powerful charger?\nNo. Is it the most mobile charger?\nAlso no. But with "good enough"\npower and charging speed, I think\nthis is a compromise that WORKS.{[0004]}Plus, when you have {color[0100]}Autobombs {color[ffff]}to\nsniff out enemy positions, you can\nput yourself in the perfect spot to\ncharge up and attack!{[0004]}For the coup de grâce, activate your\n{color[0100]}Killer Wail 5.1 {color[ffff]}and take a moment to\npay tribute to the legendary leader\nwho inspired this weapon.
Charger_Keeper_00	I debuted this weapon before, but I'm\nas proud as ever of the {color[0100]}Goo Tuber{color[ffff]}, a\ncharger with the upgraded ability to\nstore your charge even longer!{[0004]}It offers high-pressure ink storage\nfor extended periods, allowing you to\nstay submerged while you wait for\nthe perfect shot!{[0004]}In exchange, it takes a bit longer to\ncharge, but this baby can even {color[0100]}store\na{color[ffff]} {color[0100]}partial charge{color[ffff]}, giving you the\nultimate in flexibility.{[0004]}For instance, while you use a {color[0100]}Torpedo{color[ffff]}\nto reveal enemy positions, you can\nbe comfortably charging away in\na safe spot.{[0004]}Then, when you're ready to ink 'em\nup, zip to the most advantageous\nspot and snipe away! If you miss,\nyou have {color[0100]}Tenta Missiles {color[ffff]}in your back\npocket to finish the job.{[0004]}If you want to take your strategy to\nthe next level by storing charges\nand taking advantage of each stage's\nunique terrain with your mobility,\nthis set is for you!
Slosher_Strong_00	The {color[0100]}Slosher {color[ffff]}is one of the most\ntechnologically advanced weapons I\nhave had the privilege of demoing.{[0004]}I'm kidding! It's a bucket of ink!\nBut that doesn't mean it can't be\nabsolutely brutal in the right hands.{[0004]}See, {color[0100]}slosher{color[ffff]}-type weapons are\nperfect for attacking enemies in\nelevated positions or hiding behind\nwalls. They think they're safe, and\nthen...SPLOOOSH!{[0004]}You can't rapid-fire a bucket, of\ncourse, but in conjunction with\n{color[0100]}Splat Bombs{color[ffff]},{color[0100]} {color[ffff]}you can stop almost\nanyone in their tracks.{[0004]}And with the {color[0100]}Triple Inkstrike {color[ffff]}special,\nyou have the ability to blindside the\nother team before moving in for the\nsplat. This loadout is a bucketload\nof fun!
Slosher_Diffusion_00	The {color[0100]}Tri-Slosher {color[ffff]}answers a question\nthat nobody asked, which is..."Please\nlet me fling three giant buckets of ink\nat the same time."{[0004]}Hey, come to think of it, that's not\neven a question! Anyway, since the\nTri-Slosher offers a broader attack,\nthe inkpower is a bit less than your\nbasic Slosher.\nBut when you've got {color[0100]}Toxic Mist {color[ffff]}to\nslow enemies down, it's barely even a\nproblem. Add in the {color[0100]}Inkjet{color[ffff]},{color[0100]} {color[ffff]}and you're\npacking plenty of power. This is a set\nfor sloshing away with impunity!
Slosher_Launcher_00	The {color[0100]}Sloshing Machine{color[ffff]} is like a washing\nmachine...but for getting everything\nfilthy with ink!{[0004]}Each volley of beautiful, twisting\nink hits its target with plenty of\npower and leaves a sloppy mess\neverywhere. It's great for covering\nplenty of turf.{[0004]}Try using {color[0100]}Fizzy Bombs {color[ffff]}to contain the\nother team's movement while you\ndial the Sloshing Machine up to the\nmax. The other team will be in a spin\ncycle before you know it!{[0004]}And don't forget about your {color[0100]}Booyah\nBombs{color[ffff]}—another tool in your quest\nto make a mess-terpiece of the field.\nBy now it should be clear...this set is\nNOT for neat freaks.
Slosher_Bathtub_00	Even if you've never lobbed a blob,\nit's not against blob law to use the\n{color[0100]}Bloblobber{color[ffff]}! What's more, each lob\nfires four blobs—that's an awful\nlot of lawful blobs!{[0004]}Once your tongue is untied, you can\nuse the Bloblobber to target a single\nenemy—perhaps your friend Rob—or\nan entire mob. Truly, it's a versatile\nweapon for every job.{[0004]}And although they sound out of place\nhere, the {color[0100]}Sprinkler {color[ffff]}sub weapon and\n{color[0100]}Ink Storm {color[ffff]}special actually complement\nthis set quite nicely. Like butter\nmelting over corn on the cob!
Slosher_Washtub_00	The {color[0100]}Explosher{color[ffff]} main is a reporpoised\nindustrial heater modified to fling\npiping-hot ink long distances!{[0004]}Its shots explode on contact with\nwalls and the ground, so it's handy\nfor hitting foes who like to hide!{[0004]}And with the {color[0100]}Point Sensor {color[ffff]}sub, you\ncan reveal enemy positions to your\nallies, or queue 'em up for your own\nink bath, courtesy of the Explosher.{[0004]}For super-slippery customers who\nmight be slinking along in their own\nink, fire up the {color[0100]}Ink Storm {color[ffff]}and watch\n'em scramble as they're revealed.{[0004]}With so many ways to direct the\naction, I recommend this loadout\nfor all aspiring team captains!
Spinner_Quick_00	Ooo, let me tell you all about the new\nand improved {color[0100]}Mini Splatling{color[ffff]}. Thanks\nto a few revisions with the firing\nmechanism, it charges more quickly\nthan ever!{[0004]}This loadout also comes with\n{color[0100]}Burst Bombs{color[ffff]}, which are excellent\nfor inking walls, allowing you to\nget vertical in a hurry when the\nsituation demands it.{[0004]}And speaking of situational strategy,\nwith the {color[0100]}Ultra Stamp {color[ffff]}as your special,\nyou can push the front line at the\ndrop of a splat. Try this set out if\nyou fancy yourself a field general!
Spinner_Standard_00	The mechanics of the {color[0100]}Heavy Splatling{color[ffff]}\nare similar to those of a charger, but\nit's in a weapon class of its own!{[0004]}Hold down {[030c|0000803f00000000]} to compress your ink,\nand then release {[030c|0000803f00000000]} to unleash a\nmonster stream!{[0004]}Now, as you might expect, each\ncharge takes a while to get ready\nand uses a huge amount of ink,\nleaving you wide-open while you wait.{[0004]}That's why the {color[0100]}Sprinkler {color[ffff]}is a great\nsub weapon here. It'll help your turf\nstay inked and keep a little distance\nbetween you and your enemies.{[0004]}The pro move is to fire up your\n{color[0100]}Wave Breaker {color[ffff]}to expose enemy\nlocations while the Heavy Splatling\ncharges up. Then it's open season\nfrom way downtown!{[0004]}With power like this, even enemies\nwith chargers will be jelly!
Spinner_Hyper_00	The {color[0100]}Hydra Splatling{color[ffff]} is designed to\nimpose extreme pressure on your\nopponents' turf through superior\nfirepower.{[0004]}However, because the weapon takes\nso long to charge, it's definitely\na liability in close quarters.{[0004]}I recommend using your {color[0100]}Autobombs{color[ffff]}\nto fend off incoming bogeys—and\nthey can even help reveal far-off\nopponents who can be splatted from\nlong range!{[0004]}If anyone DOES make it past your\ndefenses, the unwelcome surprises\naren't over. This loadout allows you\nto greet them with a {color[0100]}Booyah Bomb{color[ffff]}!\nMi casa is NOT su casa!{[0004]}I recommend this setup for all you\nhomebodies who want to set up\ncamp and never leave—supporting\nyour team through long-range\nfirepower instead!
Spinner_Downpour_00	Let me introduce you to a very\nspecial weapon—this is called\nthe {color[0100]}Ballpoint Splatling{color[ffff]}, and it has\na unique dual fire rate!{[0004]}Here's how it works. When you start\nfiring, the barrel spins super fast,\nspraying everything around you with\ntons of ink. It's great for covering\nturf quickly.{[0004]}But once the spin slows a bit, the\nweapon transforms into a long-range\nace! You can target faraway enemies\nwith shocking accuracy.{[0004]}And that's not all! Sorry—I've been\nwatching infomercials. The Ballpoint\n{color[0100]}can be paused midfire{color[ffff]} {color[0100]}to recharge{color[ffff]}.\nNot all splatlings can do that!{[0004]}Now, with all of these features, this\nweapon might take some getting used\nto, so I recommend taking it for a\ntest run on the firing range before\nheading straight into battle.{[0004]}In conjunction with {color[0100]}Fizzy Bombs {color[ffff]}and\nthe {color[0100]}Inkjet {color[ffff]}special, this loadout may\nnot be for beginners, but it's a\ntechnical wizard's dream come true.
Spinner_Serein_00	The {color[0100]}Nautilus 47{color[ffff]} was the first\nsplatling to allow you to {color[0100]}store your\ncharge {color[ffff]}while swimming in ink!{[0004]}It sounds like a small detail, but let\nme assure you...it's huge! It means\nyou can charge undetected until\nyou're ready to leap out and splat\nan unsuspecting opponent.{[0004]}Of course, this state-of-the-art\nweapon has a few other tricks up\nits sleeve as well...{[0004]}It can be {color[0100]}paused midshot to charge{color[ffff]}.\nIt has a stabilizer to keep your aim\nsteady while you jump. And it makes\nan inkredible grilled cheese! Oh, I may\nhave dreamed the last one...{[0004]}Anyway, with the {color[0100]}Point Sensor {color[ffff]}sub\nand {color[0100]}Ink Storm {color[ffff]}special to help read\nopponent positions, this loadout can\nmake you feel like you're playing in\nCod Mode!
Maneuver_Short_00	The {color[0100]}Dapple Dualies{color[ffff]} are dualie-type\nweapons that have been obsessively\nengineered for optimum mobility!{[0004]}They're now lighter, allowing for\nfaster movement, but they\nhave less range. It's a trade-off.{[0004]}But you know what goes well with\nmobility? Even more mobility! That's\nwhere the {color[0100]}Tacticooler {color[ffff]}special shines.{[0004]}Blitz forward with added speed from\nthe Tacticooler, and place {color[0100]}Squid{color[ffff]}\n{color[0100]}Beakons {color[ffff]}to help your teammates\nsecure forward positions to take\nadvantage of this set.{[0004]}It's not a hit-and-run strategy.\nIt's more like...run-hit-run-run-hit-\nhit-hit-run... You get the picture.
Maneuver_Normal_00	Here we have the {color[0100]}Splat Dualies{color[ffff]}, a\n{color[0100]}dualie{color[ffff]} weapon born from the "ink\nhard or get splatted trying" culture\nof Turf War battles!{[0004]}These are dual-wielding, pistol-type\nweapons that—let's be honest—look\npretty sweet. But there's some real\nsubstance behind the style...{[0004]}The propulsive exhaust nozzles on\neach weapon allow you to perform\na high-speed {color[0100]}Dodge Roll{color[ffff]}!{[0004]}As a trade-off, you won't be able to\nmove for a brief moment after\nexecuting this move. But during that\ntime, the two weapon sights overlap,\nincreasing your splatting power.{[0004]}Paired with {color[0100]}Suction Bombs {color[ffff]}as your\nsub weapon, this loadout might SEEM\nas though it's lacking in power...\nthen BOOM. You realize you have\nthe {color[0100]}Crab Tank{color[ffff]}. All hail Crab Tank!
Maneuver_Gallon_00	The {color[0100]}Glooga Dualies{color[ffff]} were developed\nwith one thing in mind—pure damage.{[0004]}They're not the fastest dualies, but\nwhen you pull off a sweet Dodge Roll\nwith these in your hands, you\ntemporarily gain the ability to fire\nan outrageously powerful shot!{[0004]}Now, while the big-shot power grabs\nthe headlines, many people overlook\nthe {color[0100]}Splash Wall {color[ffff]}sub. And that's a\nmistake, because it actually gives\nyou great defensive balance.{[0004]}Last but not least, the {color[0100]}Booyah Bomb{color[ffff]}\nspecial has the potential to tip the\nscales in your favor. I hope this\nbalanced set helps you net a\nlopsided victory!
Maneuver_Dual_00	Do you know the Jet Squelcher?\nWould you like to have two of them?\nGood, because that's what {color[0100]}Dualie\nSquelchers{color[ffff]} offer!{[0004]}If you don't know the Jet Squelcher,\nit features the ability to fire off\nextremely accurate and fairly rapid\nshots after executing a roll. And\nnow you have TWO of them!{[0004]}Meanwhile, you can sniff out enemies\nwith both the {color[0100]}Wave Breaker {color[ffff]}special\nand your {color[0100]}Splat Bombs{color[ffff]}. I call it the\n"see it, splat it" strategy.{[0004]}If you like to stick and move with\naccurate shots across a long\ndistance, I recommend you give\nthis loadout a try!
Maneuver_Stepper_00	The {color[0100]}Dark Tetra Dualies{color[ffff]} feature\nfour ink-ejecting nozzles that allow\nyou to execute up to four Dodge\nRolls in a row! Yes, I said FOUR!{[0004]}And because you can shoot while\nrolling, you'll be able to zip around\nstages with ease and roll your way\nto victory.{[0004]}This loadout also comes with\n{color[0100]}Autobombs{color[ffff]}, which almost seems\nunfair. You can use those to chase\nyour opponents out of hiding spots,\nand then swoop in with the splat.{[0004]}And if they slip away? Fire up the\n{color[0100]}Reefslider {color[ffff]}and hunt 'em down, shark-\nstyle. I recommend this set for those\nwho want to set up their own pincer\nmoves and pressure the enemy!
Shelter_Normal_00	Umbrellas help you stay dry, but\n{color[0100]}Splat Brellas {color[ffff]}do that and more—like\ncoat the battlefield and any enemies\nin your path with ink!{[0004]}Let me explain. You can spray ink\nnormally with {[030c|0000803f00000000]}. But if you HOLD\n{[030c|0000803f00000000]}, the brella will open {color[0100]}like a shield{color[ffff]}!{[0004]}And if you hold {[030c|0000803f00000000]} even longer,\nyou'll {color[0100]}launch{color[ffff]} the brella itself.\nIt leaves a trail of ink, can damage\nenemies, and STILL protects you.\nIt's a triple threat!{[0004]}Speaking of triples, this set also\ncomes with the {color[0100]}Triple Inkstrike {color[ffff]}and\nthe {color[0100]}Sprinkler {color[ffff]}sub, so I guess you\ncould say it's got you covered.
Shelter_Wide_00	The {color[0100]}Tenta Brella{color[ffff]} is...well, a big\numbrella. You'd be forgiven for\nthinking it looks like the sort of\nthing you could camp in.{[0004]}Because that's certainly one way\nof using this setup! Try placing a\n{color[0100]}Squid Beakon{color[ffff]},{color[0100]} {color[ffff]}and then opening your\nTenta Brella wide for your teammates\nto gather behind.{[0004]}And if the enemy is bringing major\ninkpower that can penetrate the\nbrella? Fire up the {color[0100]}Ink Vac{color[ffff]},{color[0100]} {color[ffff]}and send\nit right back at 'em!{[0004]}I hope I've made it clear that this\nloadout is for the ultimate team\nplayer—someone who wants to\nprotect and support their team\non the path to victory!
Shelter_Compact_00	Of all the brella-type weapons, the\n{color[0100]}Undercover Brella {color[ffff]}looks the most like\nan ordinary umbrella. And that's no\naccident—the weapon was designed\nfor stealth splatting!{[0004]}Getting into the technical aspects,\nthe canopy-launching mechanism has\nbeen removed here to allow for rapid\nfire. The weapon can even be fired\nwhile the canopy is open!{[0004]}Back to stealth capabilities—you can\nuse the {color[0100]}Ink Mine {color[ffff]}sub weapon to help\nscope opponent positions before\nsneaking in for a splat they'll\nnever see coming.{[0004]}And if you're spotted? Throw all\nsubtlety out the window, fire up the\n{color[0100]}Reefslider{color[ffff]},{color[0100]} {color[ffff]}and ride boldly to victory!{[0004]}I recommend this set to all aspiring\nspies, especially those who know how\nto walk softly and carry a big\nshark-based motorcycle.
Stringer_Normal_00	I am so excited to share this new\nweapon tech with you. Behold the\n{color[0100]}Tri-Stringer{color[ffff]}—a {color[0100]}stringer{color[ffff]}-type weapon\nthat fires in three directions at once!{[0004]}Press {[030c|0000803f00000000]} while standing or running,\nand the ink will {color[0100]}fire{color[ffff]} {color[0100]}horizontally{color[ffff]}.\nPress {[030c|0000803f00000000]} while jumping for a shot\nthat's concentrated {color[0100]}vertically{color[ffff]}. The\nflexibility is unparalleled!{[0004]}And that's not even the best part.\nYou can hold down {[030c|0000803f00000000]} to charge a\nshot! The ink will fly farther AND\nexplode if it hits a wall or the floor.{[0004]}I could go on all day about stringers,\nbut I should mention that the {color[0100]}Toxic\nMist{color[ffff]} sub is great for keeping enemies\nat bay, or at least slowing them down.{[0004]}And for enemies that you can't even\nreach with a charged shot, you've\ngot the {color[0100]}Killer Wail 5.1 {color[ffff]}with supersonic\nrange at your disposal.{[0004]}I hope you'll give one of the new\nstringers a try!
Stringer_Short_00	The {color[0100]}REEF-LUX 450 {color[ffff]}is a lighter version\nof the Tri-Stringer that's a bit more\nuser-friendly for folks who are new\nto stringer-type weapons.{[0004]}Like most lightweight weapons, it\ndoesn't pack the biggest punch or\nrange—no exploding charged shots\nhere—but it does offer the ability\nto {color[0100]}store a charge{color[ffff]}!{[0004]}This set comes with {color[0100]}Curling Bombs{color[ffff]}\nto help you close the gap into enemy\nturf quickly, letting you take full\nadvantage of the nimble nature of\nyour main weapon.{[0004]}And when you want to make a big\nimpact in a hurry, don't forget about\nyour {color[0100]}Tenta Missiles{color[ffff]}. You can make it\nrain missiles on opponents out of\nrange of the REEF-LUX.{[0004]}This is a highly mobile loadout that\nlets you fight with flexibility and still\ntake down powerhouse opponents.\nI hope you give it a try!
Saber_Normal_00	If you're looking for a splatana-\ntype weapon with a bit more OOMPH,\nlook no further than the {color[0100]}Splatana\nStamper{color[ffff]}, my friend!{[0004]}Now, this weapon takes a bit longer\nto charge than the Splatana Wiper,\nbut the trade-off is a wider, more\npowerful spray of ink. It can really\ndo some damage!{[0004]}Give this a try: fire off a charged\nslash, and follow it quickly with\na horizontal slash or {color[0100]}Burst Bombs{color[ffff]}.\nNot sure what they call a one-two\npunch in swordplay, but this is it!{[0004]}And with the {color[0100]}Zipcaster {color[ffff]}special, you're\npractically buckling swashes! Er,\nswashBUCKLING. What I mean to say\nis you're basically a laser space\npirate with elite space-pirate tech!
Saber_Lite_00	The {color[0100]}Splatana Wiper{color[ffff]} is part of an\nentirely new category of weapons\nknown as {color[0100]}splatanas{color[ffff]}! These sword-\nlike slashers can fling ink through\nthe power of centrifugal force.{[0004]}To do a basic {color[0100]}horizontal slash{color[ffff]}, just\npress {[030c|0000803f00000000]}. But you can also hold\n{[030c|0000803f00000000]} to unleash a {color[0100]}vertical slash{color[ffff]} that\nwill really send some ink flying!{[0004]}On top of that, if you perform a\nvertical slash while tilting {[0307|7b142e3f00000000]} a bit\nforward, you'll step forward with the\nattack, adding enough power to\nflatten most foes.{[0004]}Paired with the {color[0100]}Torpedo {color[ffff]}sub, you can\nslash across the battlefield and level\nyour enemies with a single stroke.\nIt's almost too good!{[0004]}And I haven't even mentioned the\n{color[0100]}Ultra Stamp {color[ffff]}special yet. If the\nother team hasn't surrendered,\nthe {color[0100]}Ultra Stamp {color[ffff]}is sure to make\n'em think twice.{[0004]}If you want to be among the first\ntrailblazers in the splatana-fighting\ngenre, this set is for you!

SpInkStorm	Throw this device to generate a rain cloud of ink.\nThe cloud gradually moves away from where the\ndevice was thrown.
SpUltraShot	Press {[030c|0000803f00000000]} to launch three blasts of spiraling ink\nin a single shot. You can fire it up to three times.
SpUltraStamp	Attack with an enormous hammer. Press and hold\n{[030c|0000803f00000000]} to advance while striking with the hammer.\nIf you press and release {[030a|0000803f00000000]}, you'll throw the\nhammer far into the distance to attack and the\nspecial will end.
SpGreatBarrier	Deploy this device at your feet to shield yourself\nwith a large, spherical barrier. This bubble will block\noutside ink attacks, but it can't prevent opponents\nthemselves from entering. Damage to the top section\nor the inner device will cause the barrier to pop\nmore quickly.
SpJetpack	This launches you into the air by spraying out\nink, allowing you to attack opponents with the\nattached launcher. You can fly higher temporarily\nby pressing {[0301|0000803f00000000]}.
SpShockSonar	Deploys a device that generates sonic waves to drive\nhidden opponents out into the open. Waves expand\nalong the ground, marking and dealing damage to any\nopponents they touch. To avoid damage, simply jump\nover each wave.
SpSuperHook	Transform into an ink-cloaked acrobat, and sling\nyour stretchy arm to zip around the battlefield!\nUse {[030a|0000803f00000000]} to aim and stick to walls. You can still\nuse your main weapon like normal with {[030c|0000803f00000000]}. When\nyour ink runs out, your transformation will end, and\nyou'll Super Jump back to your starting location.
SpSkewer	Hop onto a shark-shaped, ink-propelled float, and\ncharge forward. When you reach the end of the path,\nor if you press {[030c|0000803f00000000]}, the float will explode and\ndeal damage.
SpChariot	Leave your foes in a pinch with this scuttling tank's\nsuperior inkpower. Press {[030c|0000803f00000000]} for rapid-fire\nshots—{[030a|0000803f00000000]} will fire your cannon. Its back is\nvulnerable to enemy attacks, but you can shift into\nmobile mode with {[030b|0000803f00000000]} to protect yourself.
SpNiceBall	Funnel power into an explosive ink ball, and launch it\nat the enemy. By sending and receiving "Booyahs"\nfrom your team, you can build power more quickly.\nTeammates who send Booyahs will be rewarded by\nhaving their special gauge filled a little.
SpBlower	Make your ink shots more powerful by sucking up\nenemy attacks! Hold {[030c|0000803f00000000]} to generate a vortex\nthat sucks up enemy ink attacks. Once the tank is\nfull, or after the timer runs out, let go of {[030c|0000803f00000000]},\nand you'll launch a souped-up super ink shot!

Comment_00	Welcome to Grizzco Industries. And congrats on taking\nyour first step toward financial securi—{[0004]}Just got here, huh? Look, there's no way I'd hire\nyou right now. You'd only get hurt, and that's far\nmore paperwork than I want to deal with.{[0004]}Hey, don't give me the sad face... OK, how's this—if you\nreally want it that bad, bootstrap yourself up to {color[0100]}level 4{color[ffff]}\nand come back. THEN I'll hire ya!
EventFlowMsg\LobbyCoop_Tutorial00.msbt
Comment_00	Hey, kid. You look like you've got potential. I think you\ncould help shape the future of the Splatlands!{[0004]}I'm Mr. Grizz. Yes, Grizzco is my company. That's my\nname on the door...and everything else. But I'm here\nto show you how Grizzco is different.{[0004]}See, from the top level—that's me—to fresh, young\ntalent like you, we're committed to making the world\na better place.{[0004]}So allow me to officially welcome you to the crew.\nIt's good, honest work with an honest paycheck.\nI just know you'll fit right in.
Comment_01	Now that you're on board, let's make sure your\n{color[0100]}training {color[ffff]}is up to date.{[0004]}Can we get started now?
Select00_Yes	I'm ready!
Select00_No	Maybe later?
Comment_02	That's what I like to see! You're a go-getter,\njust like a young me.
Comment_03	I see.{[0100|0f000000]} Well, we can reschedule the final onboarding\nprocess, I suppose. Just don't make this a habit!
Comment_04	Now then, I'll just check your records...
Comment_05	Everything is in order. And the helicopter is ready.\nAre you ready to hop in?{[0100|1e000000]} Time is money, and money\nis helicopters, so let's go!
Comment_06	Hold the phone...you're a returning employee!\nWelcome back!{[0100|1e000000]} I know how hard it is to stay away.{[0004]}Well, I think you'll find your way around just fine.\nBut if you are interested in a refresher, it's not\na bad idea to look over the basics again.
Select01_Yes	I'd like a refresher.
Select01_No	No, thanks.
Comment_07	Of course, of course. As long as you're following\nprotocols TO THE LETTER, it's a safe job.{[0004]}Ah, I'm told the helicopter is ready. {[0100|1e000000]}Shall we head out?
Comment_08	I appreciate the confidence! I'm not sure HR would\napprove of deviating from mandatory training,\nbut...let's not tell them, just this once.
Comment_09	Oh, yeah! This may be old news to someone with your\nexperience, but word around the watercooler is some\n{color[0100]}new Boss Salmonids{color[ffff]} were spotted in the Splatlands.
Comment_10	We usually require all employees to take a training\ncourse on how to defeat Boss Salmonids...{[0004]}But really, it's all in the manual. Read that over and—\nOh! Sounds like the next helicopter's about to head out.{[0004]}Why don't you head down to the site for a little\nsink-or-swim time?{[0100|1e000000]} We can haul you—or whatever's\nleft of you—back any time you like.
Comment_11	What do you say? Ready for some on-the-job training?
Select02_Yes	I'm ready!
Select02_No	Not now.
Comment_12	I like that can-do attitude!{[0100|1e000000]} Now get on the helicopter.
Comment_13	Understood.{[0100|0f000000]} We can table that until you're ready.
EventFlowMsg\LobbyCoop_Tutorial00After.msbt
Comment_00	Welcome back!{[0100|0f000000]} I've got a fuzzy feeling you're going to\nbe a great addition to team Grizzco.{[0100|0f000000]} But first...{[0004]}There's another round of training I'd like you to do. It's\njust a silly requirement after...{[0100|0f000000]} I won't bore you with\nthe details. We just don't want you to get hurt.{[0004]}So we're going to teach you how to deal with all the\nmany types of {color[0100]}Boss Salmonids{color[ffff]}, including the new ones\nthey've been finding in the Splatlands.{[0004]}But honestly, if you just read the manual, you'll see—\nOh! Sounds like the next helicopter's about to head out.{[0004]}Well...sink or swim, I always say!
Comment_01	Let's get you down to the site and finish your training.{[0100|1e000000]}\nReady to go?
Comment_02	Fantastic!{[0100|0f000000]} Into the helicopter and off you go!
Comment_03	Fine. No rush.{[0100|0f000000]} Come back whenever you can fit it into\nyour schedule.
EventFlowMsg\LobbyCoop_Tutorial01.msbt
Comment_00	THERE you are, kid. I was wondering when you'd show up\nto finish your training.{[0004]}As I was saying, this is required training for every\nemployee.{[0100|0f000000]} I know, I know... But you know how lawyers\nare.{[0100|0f000000]} Or if you're lucky, you don't.
Comment_01	We're going to teach you how to deal with the many\ntypes of {color[0100]}Boss Salmonids{color[ffff]} out there, including the new\nones they've been finding in the Splatlands.{[0004]}You can read all about them in the manual later—the\nnext helicopter's about to head out. That means it's\nsink-or-swim time!
Comment_02	Are you ready to head down to the site to finish up\nyour training?
Comment_03	Fantastic!{[0100|0f000000]} Into the helicopter and off you go!
Comment_04	Still?{[0100|0f000000]} That's OK. I'm sure your schedule will clear\neventually.

From here on out, you'll\nbe teaming up with coworkers, which means more lives\nand a LOT more limbs to risk!{[0004]}Oh! {color[0100]}One last thing.{color[ffff]}{[0100|1e000000]} When you're out there, remember\nthat every wave is gonna be different, just like the sea.{[0100|1e000000]}\nAnd there's no training for the sea.
Comment_01	The sea is always changing. Every single wave brings\nsomething new...{[0004]}And you'll have to change with it.{[0100|1e000000]} We all will, if we want\nto succeed. That's the {color[0100]}most important thing {color[ffff]}of all...{[0004]}Hm? Sorry. My mind started wandering for a bit there.\nBut my point still stands!{[0004]}The next time you're out there, it'll be the real deal,\nand you never know what the sea will throw at you.{[0004]}Good luck!

EventFlowMsg\LobbyVersus_IntrouceShop.msbt
Shop_00	Pardon the interruption, but we're picking up\na pretty fresh vibe from you lately...{[0004]}Did you know that there are a few {color[0100]}shops {color[ffff]}around\nhere with {color[0100]}gear {color[ffff]}that can help you out?{[0004]}I'm talking {color[0100]}clothes{color[ffff]}, {color[0100]}shoes{color[ffff]}, {color[0100]}headgear{color[ffff]}, and\neven new {color[0100]}weapons{color[ffff]}. And a {color[0100]}general store{color[ffff]} too!{[0004]}Check 'em out...and tell 'em this disembodied\nvoice sent ya!
EventFlowMsg\LobbyVersus_UnlockBankaraMatch.msbt
UnlockBankaraMatch_00	Whoa, you've made quite a splash already.\nI bet you're ready for {color[0100]}Anarchy Battles{color[ffff]}!{[0004]}Anarchy Battles are the next level—you put\n{color[0100]}Rank Points {color[ffff]}on the line before you engage.{[0004]}And you can also try some new modes, like\n{color[0100]}Splat Zones {color[ffff]}and {color[0100]}Tower Control{color[ffff]}. Check 'em out!
UnlockBankaraMatch_01	Press {[0306|0000803f00000000]} when you're in the battle pot to\n{color[0100]}brush up on the rules{color[ffff]} before you get started!
UnlockBankaraMatch_02	Oh, by the way...there are two types of\nAnarchy Battles: {color[0100]}Open {color[ffff]}and {color[0100]}Series{color[ffff]}.{[0004]}If you only have a little time or you want to\njoin friends in battle, choose {color[0100]}Open{color[ffff]}.{[0004]}It's just a single battle, so you're in and\nout in no time.{[0004]}On the other hand, if you want to play solo and\ncommit to a longer session, give {color[0100]}Series {color[ffff]}a try!{[0004]}It's a best-of-five challenge with serious upside\nAND serious risk when it comes to your rank.
UnlockBankaraMatch_03	Of course, Regular Battles are always a good\nchoice. You can keep earning experience there!{[0004]}Either way, get out there and splat to your\nheart's content! May your ink never run dry.

009	My circuits are designed to measure your intellectual\nand physical prowess as demonstrated by your ability\nto complete missions throughout Alterna.{[0004]}In each mission, you must reach a goal mechanism or\ncomplete an objective.

010	Is all of that going to be on the test?\nBecause all I really heard was POWER EGGS.
011	That seems like the important part. We'll need plenty\nof those if we're going to find Gramps.
012	One last thing. {[0100|0f000000]}As you complete missions and become\nan ever-more-exceptional citizen, you will naturally\ngain increased access to the {color[0100]}Alterna Log{color[ffff]}.{[0004]}Do not attempt to share the Alterna Log without\npermission.{[0100|1e000000]} Please handle the information with care.{[0100|0f000000]}\nAnd please consider this a threat.

EventFlowMsg\Mission_BigWorldTutorial.msbt
000	We've never been here before either, but here's\nthe tour anyway...
001	We think this place is called {color[0100]}Alterna{color[ffff]}. Who knew it\nwas beneath the Crater this whole time?!
002	We count six different islands so far. What should\nwe call them? {color[0100]}Sites {color[ffff]}or something?
003	Uh, are you even gonna mention the HUMONGOUS\nrocket over there?! {[0100|1e000000]}Look at that!
004	Way to steal my thunder. Anyway...we put a tracking\ndevice on Gramps, as one does. But now we're getting\na {color[0100]}strong signal{color[ffff]} from three different areas!
005	Agent 3! Your mission is to {color[0100]}check all 3 of\nthose places out{color[ffff]}!
006	We upgraded your map a little bit. Tell us how much\nyou love it!
007	Now it tracks the {color[0100]}places you've already visited {color[ffff]}and\nlights up when you're near anything interesting.
008	Like when I'm nearby?{[0100|0f000000]} Or...buried treasure, I guess.
009	We're here to look for Gramps. Not treasure. And I\nhardly think Agent 3 needs a Callie tracker. Anyway...
010	Wait! {[0100|0f000000]}Agent 3 is totally out of Power Eggs. Did you lose\nthem all in the fall?{[0004]}YIKES!{[0100|0f000000]} Your Hero Suit is all messed up too!
011	Oh, don't be dramatic. I mean, sure, Agent 3 will have\nto collect Power Eggs...and upgrade from scratch...{[0004]}Hmmm. I guess an explanation would help.{[0004]}First, they'll need {color[0100]}{[031f|0000803f00000000]}Sardinium {color[ffff]}to {color[0100]}unlock{color[ffff]} access\nto different types of upgrades...{[0004]}Then they can spend {color[0100]}Upgrade Points{color[ffff]} to do the\nactual upgrading!
012	There's gotta be some {color[0100]}{[031f|0000803f00000000]}Sardinium {color[ffff]}down here in\nAlterna, right?{[0100|1e000000]} If anyone can find it, it's Agent 3!
013	Wait... Did you tell Agent 3 how to actually GET\n{[0320|0000803f00000000]}{color[0100]}Upgrade Points{color[ffff]}? {[0100|0f000000]}No? {[0100|0f000000]}I'm on it!{[0004]}Agent 3, just {color[0100]}ink lots of stuff {color[ffff]}and {color[0100]}find items{color[ffff]}! I guess\nit isn't rocket science. {[0100|1e000000]}Which is a shame, because it\nseems like we might NEED some rocket science...
014	Never mind that for now! I'm getting a strong Gramps-\nlike signal from the next site over. {[0100|1e000000]}Go check it out!

002	Well...we should investigate just in case. We'll follow\nyour lead, Agent 3. Watch your step!
EventFlowMsg\Mission_FirstArea04.msbt
000	Ew. This place is kind of a mess. {[0100|1e000000]}But WAIT!

002	Aha! There's even a pipe on the other side!
003	Still no sign of Gramps though...
004	Well, let's see what we can find here. Good luck!
100	Phew! You've made it pretty far, huh?

EventFlowMsg\Mission_FirstArea06.msbt

001	Greater Inkopolis and the Splatlands have wildly different methods of\nserving up clam mochi. "Inkopolis style" means a clam wrapped in mochi,\nbut Splatlanders wrap the mochi with clams! They also sprinkle on sesame\nseeds and top it with hot sauce. Mmm... It's Splatsville's clam to fame!
002	"Long ago, our splatted lands were almost washed away by a great flood.\nAll was presumed lost...until three lights appeared and united to consume\nthe disaster. Thankful for their salvation, the townsfolk threw a festival\nwith three portable shrines as a tribute."
003	"Visit a sparkling city of chaos."\n"The hottest place in the Splatlands!"\n"Anarchy Avenue. Walk it. Feel it. Live it."\n—Special Collection, "Walk the Splatsville Walk," pg. 54
004	"Live wild! Live free! We do whatever we want!\nThis town is a melting pot, so let's stir things up!"\n"I'm tired of folks pretending to be cool.\nI wanna get so fired up that I boil over!"
005	For the Inklings and Octolings of the Splatlands, aggressive action\nis the best way to make a splash in the local scene. Youths will often\ndress themselves in the style of a delinquent or hooligan to intimidate\npeers during combative courtship rituals known as "rumbles."
006	"The lobby I've built doesn't have a single standout feature...'cause\nEVERYTHING in there is featureworthy! If you don't have the greatest\nTurf War experience ever, I'll eat the smaller of my two claws."\n—Glen Fiddler, President & CEO 
007	Grizzco Industries Occupational-Safety Guidelines\n(1) Keep your eggs in the game. (2) "I'll try to grab one more!"\ncould end with one less—of YOU! (3) Sea goes dark, tide goes up.\n(4) ACB: Always Check the Basket. (5) Throw eggs! Don't yolk around!
008	Salmonids mature by returning to the waters where they were spawned.\nSometimes, in very rare cases, a young Salmonid will stray too far from\ntheir original school during a run and become lost. Their wandering quest\nto return home can lead to prolonged starvation and an insatiable appetite.
009	"Splatsville's rowdiest, loud-iest trio is hijacking the airwaves!\nClean out those ears and open those eyes wide for your hometown\nhype squad, Deep Cut! Tune in and catch 'em—if you can!"
010	"A hungry blade, a sharp grin in a wild warrior's hand.\nIt bites just once—a flash, a slash, a sudden shudder.\nShredded remains sink down, down, down like falling snow.\nA fleeting flurry, brief as life itself, falls around my open parasol."
011	"Moray Eel Manipulation: Secret Dances of the Onaga Clan\nFirst: Soak the dry ground like a welcome summer rainstorm.\nSecond: Stir up a whirlpool to summon winds from the rocky shore.\nFinal: As a hundred eels take flight, follow them to the promised land."
012	The Manta Clan's Early-Morning Ritual\nAfter careful grooming of their pectoral fins, the family gathers for their\nfavorite breakfast. This unique plankton dish, a family recipe passed down\nacross generations, is said to enhance the mind, body, and bodily toxins.
013	"One year after expanding his business into a new region."\n"Bombarding the Splatlands with over 20,000 hours of rapid-fire\nweapons chatter! His steel scopes are aimed at a new horizon."\n"What's next for the so-called arsenal ambassador?"
014	"#PondSnailLikeABoss #EddyIsGnarly #ChaoticSunshine #FreshHeadgear\n#ShellfishBeFreshFish #MasterOfMerchants #NautilusIntrospection\n#GotThatGoldenRatio #GottaGetOutOfYourShell #NautCouture4Life"
015	"Man-o'-Wardrobe" "We are temporarily closed so that we may restock."\n"Cash only" "No photography or influencers allowed. Ever." "We've run\nrather low on paper bills." "We're always open. Your fashion emergency\nis our fashion emergency." "Do NOT touch it until you have PAID for it."
016	As they grow, crustaceans such as the coconut crab frequently shed their\nshells to allow for further growth. Because strong sunlight encourages\nthis shedding behavior, this may explain why Splatlands crustaceans often\ngrow to be far larger than their counterparts in other regions.
017	"YO! Barry C. here, Hotlantis's hottest (only) owner, ha! I gotta split for\na bit to stock up on...stock. （・ω<） But it's all good! Harmony (yup, from\nChirpy Chips) is fillin' in, and she knows this shop way, WAY better than\nme. (;^_^A So business? That's gonna keep right on boomin'! （＾ｖ＾）v"
018	"Fryin' out here in Scorch Gorge—in more ways than one!\n#SweatyShell #BikingTrip"
019	"Letter of Appointment\nEmployment: New Squidbeak HQ, First Splatoon\nAdjustments: Promoted to Captain with emoluments of pay grade 33.\n–Craig Cuttlefish"
020	"Thursday night / Friday morning at 1:00 AM: It's the 100th episode of\nMarie After Midnight, and a special guest stopped by to help me celebrate:\nmy cousin Callie! It's a Squid Sisters gabfest! We could NOT stop talking.\n(Not kidding. We went over the scheduled end time by five hours. Oops.)"
021	Seems these are instructions on how to mummify an Inkling. Maybe in\nolden times, Inklings thought if they preserved their bodies after death,\nthey could be revived someday? But that's... Well, there's no way this is\na real one stuck here, right? No, of course it isn't... Right?
022	After leaping from Inkopolis Square to the world stage, Off the Hook has\nfound their new side project: performing vocals for a rising rock band as\nDamp Socks feat. Off the Hook! Discovered online, their super-talented\ncollaborators offer an "upbeat melancholy" sound that had OTH...hooked!
023	"Operation: Li'l Judd's Judgy Judgment!" "Prey's behavior"\n"Analyzing prey's fur quality... No impurrrfections found!"\n"I guess I'll just go after the toe beans."
024	"Subject name: 'Marigold'\nNishiyo Oranda (Alias): Anarchy District 3, 3-■\nPoisson Rouge (Alias): Rue de ■■ 19-6, Chateaubateau\nRan Chi-Yu (Alias): Southgill Province, Tailfin City, ■■■ District"
