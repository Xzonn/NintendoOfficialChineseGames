KirbyNormal	Kirby was pulled into a mysterious vortex that\nappeared in the sky over his home on Planet\nPopstar. When he woke up, he was in a new\nworld! Traveling through that vortex also gave\nKirby a new and mysterious power... Let's see\nwhat it can do! Onward to adventure!
SupportChara	A mystical new friend you met in a mysterious\nnew world. You found Elfilin as he was trying\nto save the Waddle Dees from the Beast Pack.\nHe seems happy to be Kirby's guide, sharing\nhelpful advice to save the Waddle Dees and\nrebuild their town. Thanks, Elfilin!
BandanaWaddleDee	Bandana Waddle Dee was pulled through the\nvortex along with Kirby. When he heard that\nhis fellow Waddle Dees were being captured\nby the Beast Pack, he grabbed his trusty\nspear and ran to help! He can join you as P2\nwhile you explore the new world.
WaddleDee	These Dee-lightful residents of Planet Popstar\nlanded in the new world before Kirby arrived.\nThings looked grim when wild beasts began to\ncapture them and steal their precious food...\nbut with Kirby's help, they're rebuilding their\ntown and starting over!
KirbySword	Slice through this new world as a sword-\nwielding, green-hatted hero! Try charging up\nbefore you swing for extra power. Train hard,\nand become this world's new sword master!
KirbyBomb	Hold down the button to aim and throw.\nGot it? Hold, aim, throw! Throw, hit, BOOM!\nYou can run and throw them too, or roll them\nahead of you to get an explosive strike!
KirbyCutter	Swish! Sling that sharp-edged boomerang!\nUse it to grab far-off items. Hold the button\ndown to freeze it in midair and charge it up.\nThat will make it extra powerful! Swish!
DeformKirbyCar	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire car into his mouth!\nWhen he does, he turns into a peppy, pink car\nthat can jump and use Turbo Dash. It's a nice\nday for a scenic drive. Turn up the radio!
DeformKirbyCone	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire cone into his\nmouth! Use your pointy head to jab below\nyou and bust open cracks in the ground or\non pipes. You're out of cone-trol, Kirby!
DeformKirbyWaterTank	Kirby gained the mysterious Mouthful Mode\nability after he flew through that vortex...\nNow he can stuff an entire dome into his\nmouth! Wrap around one of these, then twist\nuntil it pops open. Think there's anything\ngood inside? Only one way to find out!
CaptiveCage	One of the Waddle Dees being held captive by\nthe fearsome Beast Pack. There are so many\nout there waiting to be saved. You can\nalmost hear them calling for help... "Wa-wa!\nWa-wa!" Let me out, let me out! Wait, you\nhear that too? One of them must be nearby!
GoalPoint	The Beast Pack managed to catch these three\nWaddle Dees with one golden cage! If they\nwork together, they might be able to... Oh.\nNever mind. They're too sad to move. All they\ncan do is cry out for help. "Wa-wa, wa-wa!"\nSomebody save them!
AnimalWaddleDee	A common beast that can be found all over\nthe new world. They're pretty cute, but they\nhave a dangerous wild side. They'll growl and\njump at anyone who crosses them! A whole\nbunch of these critters attacked the Waddle\nDees. Funny, you'd think they'd get along!
TackleEnemy	Behold! It's the brutal, brutish Buffahorn!\nWeak attacks won't stand a chance against\nthis critter's forward tackle. Good thing they\nhave a hard time stopping! If you're careful,\nyou can trick them into running off cliffs.\nThey'll be OK down there. They're real tough.
Turtle	Tortorner has a whole shell made of concrete,\nas if it walked off with somebody's sidewalk!\nIt has a thick skull and a mean bite, but its\nbody is pretty delicate. A Mouthful Mode\nability might help you crack through its shell\nand land a brutal blow from above!
TurtleBig	Whoa! Tortuilding's shell is a whole building!\nThis big baddie must be some kind of boss\nfor the smaller beasts. It enjoys basking in\nthe sun, so it climbs to high spots and claims\nthe whole area as its territory. (It must take a\nlong time for this critter to get up there...)
CarshopSignboard	This logo belonged to an auto shop named\nHoline Custom Autos—part of Holine Corp.\nHoline also sold industrial parts, managed\nconstruction, and made all kinds of stuff.\nFrom buildings to streets to amusement-park\nrides, remember: if it's quality, it's Holine!\nErr, perhaps "it was" would be more accurate.
CompanyBoard	The Lightron Works Company was a massive\ncorporation that invested in research and\ndevelopment within all kinds of fields: electro,\nbio, astro, and more! Lightron eventually split\nup, giving rise to many rival companies and\ncountless heated corporate battles.
MaxTomato	If your health is low, just eat a Maxim Tomato\nto fully heal yourself. (They're packed with\nnutrients!) Did these fall through the same\nvortex as Kirby and his friends, or were they\nin the new world already? It's hard to tell,\nbut everyone seems to enjoy them—even the\nBeast Pack!
