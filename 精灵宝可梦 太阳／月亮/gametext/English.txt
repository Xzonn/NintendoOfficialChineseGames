12	If you need some help, give me a little poke in\nthe middle of my map! But not too hard! Zz-zzt!
13	I’ve set the Trainers’ School as our destination!\nLet’s get this show on the road! Zzzt!
14	So izzz a Trainers’ School where Trainers go\nto learn? Or do Trainers do the teaching?
15	Find those four Pokémon Trainers! Zzz-zzzt!\nYou find ’em, you battle ’em, you beat ’em!
16	Zzrt?! You were called to the office already?\nNaughty [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl! It’s off to 2F with you!
17	Hau’oli izzz ready for us and I’m ready for it!\nLet’s go! Life in the big city is a-calling!
18	Zzrt?! He wants you to pet that big ol’ Tauros?!\nIf I had a pulse, it’d be racing right now!
19	Looks like your next destination izzz a trial site.\nIt’s off to Verdant Cavern, plucky adventurer!
20	Izzz something going on in the Berry fields?!\nGet in there! I need my Berry supply kept safe!
21	Time for training! Time for trials!\nTime for us to storm that Verdant Cavern! Zzt!
22	Thozzze Pokémon are pretty fierce little things!\nGood luck getting all the way through the cave!
23	Now! To the heart of the cave! It’s finally time\nto get your mitts on your first Z-Crystal! Zzzt!
24	It’zzz been a while since you last battled Hau...\nLooks like he’d rather make it a regular thing!
25	Zzt! Finally time for you to take on Hala himself!\nGet yourself off to Iki Town...if you dare to!
26	You should probably meet up with Kahuna Hala.\nI’d guess he’zzz around Iki Town somewhere...
27	A Pokémon battle against big Kahuna Hala!\nI’m tingling all over—almost like I’m Electric! Ha!
28	You done telling your mom that you’re off on an\nadventure? Then it’zzz off to the Marina next!
29	When you’re ready to blow this lemonade stand,\nlet’s go to the Marina and set sail! Zz-zz-zz!
30	Zzzzzrrt!\nNice to meet you, pal! Gentle on the goods, OK?
31	Zzrt?! He wants you to pet that big ol’ Tauros?!\nIf I had a pulse, it’d be racing right now!
32	I don’t know about you, but I’m ready for a nice\nstroll around Hau’oli. Especially the beach!
33	Hau’oli’s got plenty of tall buildings, zzz-zzt!\nIt’s even got a tourist bureau of its own!
34	Plenty of shopzzz to check out in Hau’oli.\nEven an apparel shop. If I had a body, I’d go!
35	There’re even government offices here in Hau’oli.\nJust what everyone wants in paradise! Zzz-zzt!
36	Did I hear someone say Team Skull?\nIn the Marina? Zz-zz-zz!
37	Team Skull or malasadazzz...\nHow can we choose? I wanna check out both!
38	Ohhhh! A battle against those Team Skull\nnumskullzzz in the Marina? Count me in!
39	Greetings! It’s Captain Ilima there! Zz-zz-zz!\nWhat do you bet he’s as strong as he thinks?
40	If you want to see more of that dreamboat Ilima,\nhe’s waitin’ for you outside that cave of hizzz!
41	Where could Lillie have gone off to?\nRoute 3 izzz not big. But it izzz pretty bare...
42	Zzt! Hurry it up and save Nebby already!\nWe little Pokémon need all the help we can get!
43	Good save, [VAR 1100(00FF,0504)]boyomissy! Now let’s ditch these flowers\nbefore I sneeze myself right outta this ’Dex!
44	A Poké Finder?! I wanna give it a try! Zzz-zzt!\nBoy, I might never want to leave this Pokédex!
45	Finders keepers and thizzz Finder is mine!\nPress  whenever you see the icon change!
46	Route 2 izzz just too exciting to miss to-day!\nThere is, to wit, two-plus-two buildings to find!
47	I think I see something in front of Route 2...\nSomething I didn’t really want to see again...
48	What do you think there izzz beyond Route 2?\nIt’s too much! I can’t wait to see it all!
49	Enough with all this helping folks outta pinches!\nLet’zzz get to that trial at last, kiddo!
50	It’s finally time to take on that Ilima character!\nI’m tingling with excitement! Or just electricity...
51	So this izzz Heahea City? I can see the sea!\nLet’s give the city a good search before we go!
52	Zzz-zzt! My Rotom sense izzz tingling! There’s\na beautiful building to be explored up ahead!
53	Zmm! That Sina and Dexio smell like a challenge!\nYou can just feel the power coming off of them!
54	There’zzz a town up Route 4 we’ve never seen!\nNothing gets me fired up like a new destination!
55	Ahhh... Now this izzz a mighty fine place.\nI reckon I could get to like it here, pardner.
56	Route 5 izzz pretty famous among Trainers as\nbeing a great place to train your team up! Zzzt!
57	Next stop izzz another trial site! Brooklet Hill!\nWhat’s a brooklet anyway? Is it like a booklet?
58	Let’s follow Lana and see what’s up ahead!\nOooh, I hope it’zzz something good!
59	So what izzz causing that splashing? Go see!\nBut don’t drop me in there! I’m not waterproof!
60	Can’t you hear that splashing from up ahead?\nI don’t even have earzzz, and I can! Zz-zzt!
61	Another suspicious bit of splashing out there!\nDon’t let any droplets get on me, pleazzze!
62	Zrt?! What in—?! When did Lana get past us?\nThat girl must have some super secret power!
63	We’re going all the way into Brooklet Hill?\nI don’t know about thizzz... I’ve got a bad feelin’!
64	Zzzrt... Th-that big splashing over there...\nDo you think that’zzz just another Wishiwashi?
65	I’m pretty sure I saw something that looked like\na town farther down Route 6. Zzzrt?
66	Zoinks! What’re you waiting for? Let’zzz go!\nI wanna see that Battle Royal Dome for myself!
67	My circuits are all lit up! It’zzz electrifying!\nLet’s live it up at the Battle Royal Dome!
68	Seemzzz like Wela Volcano Park lies off Route 7.\nCareful you don’t end up in any hot water, pal!
69	Was there something different between the first\nand the second dances?! What am I mizzzing?!
70	Blast past that Captain’zzz barricade and into\nyour next adventure, pal! You’re on fire! Zzzt!
71	The next trial site should be past Route 8 and\nits salty breeze, perfect for rusting my partzzz!
72	Zzrt? Time for your third trial on Akala Island?\nThen off to Lush Jungle! It sounds so luxuriant!
73	Zzzrmmm... I’m not such a big fan of jungles...\nWhere are all the comfy machines at, huh?!
74	Zoo-hoo! Time for uzzz to get cooking, partner!\nWe’ll have that Totem Pokémon here in a flash!
75	Didn’t the professor tell you to head for that\nDimensional Research Lab? Zzz-zzrt?
76	Off to the Dimensional Research Lab! Zzzp!\nThough the dimensions of my ’Dex are perfect...
77	What? Doezzz the prof think we’ve got nothing\nbetter to do than read things and talk to folks?
78	Diglett’s Tunnel? What a lucky bunch...\nI wanna have a place named after me, too! Zzzt!
79	If we get through this tunnel, we’ll be just steps\naway from Konikoni City, [VAR 1100(00FF,0B07)]big boyclever girl! Zzzzp!
80	Zzzrrr... Which one izzz Olivia’s shop?\nWhy doesn’t my map have this programmed in?
81	So it’s the Ruinzzz of Life next! Head east off\nof Route 9 and kiss civilization good-bye!
82	I think I like that Aether Foundation lady...\nDid you see, zzt? Was she looking my way?
83	Nothing like beating Team Skull numskullzzz!\nBut now it’s back on track to the Ruins of Life.
84	What type of Pokémon do you wanna bet that\nKahuna Olivia will use? I’m gonna go with...Rock.
85	You do know the Hano Grand Rezzzort, right?\nIt’s only, like, the most famous hotel in Alola!
86	You interested in meeting the prezzzident?\nShe should be somewhere in here, right?
87	Zzrt?! I’ve never seen a Pokémon like that!!\nA-are we really gonna fight that...that thing?!
88	Malie Garden? Never heard of it myzzzelf.\nWhat kind of place do you think it’ll be? Zzzr?
89	Uh...so...where’zzz the professor?\nHe is the one who told us to come here, yeah?
90	This place kinda reminds me of the Johto region.\nThizzz Malie City place, I mean. You know? Zzt?
91	Malie Library next, huh? Zzz-zzt...\nWell, you could probably do with some learning!
92	Didn’t Lillie say she’d be upstairzzz?\nOr am I just hearing thingzzz?
93	There are plenty of Pokémon living on Route 10!\nWouldn’t you like to meet a few? Zz-zz-zzt!
94	When is that Exeggutor Express gonna come?\nMaybe the bus stop will give you a clue? Zzrt?
95	Hokulani Observatory is on Mount Hokulani’s\npeak. The air izzz real clear at high altitudes!
96	I think you’d better go with Molayne there, pal.\nSee what Hokulani Observatory hazzz to offer.
97	This trial that “Soffy” and “Big Mo” devised...\nI’ve gotta say, it’s left me in the dark! Zz-zz-zz!
98	So the professor’s back in Malie Garden again?\nFind him to give him that mask, my friend! Zzt!
99	You did clear, heh, “Soffy’s” trial, right?\nWhat’s holding you back then? Let’s explore!
100	If we go through the captain’s barricade, we\ncan finally get out onto Route 12!
101	I gotta admit, friend. I do love a good Mudsdale!\nIt just looks so strong and sturdy, yeah? Zzzt!
102	Does Tapu Village have something to do with\nTHE tapu? The guardianzzz of the islandzzz?
103	Aether House? Is it another part of the Aether\nFoundation? ’Cauzzze I’ll eat my ’Dex if it’s not!
104	Acerola’s trial is your next hurdle, bucko!\nCome on! Let’zzz head outside and get to it!
105	OK, the next trial site is creeping me out a bit.\nZzz-zzz... You sure we need to go in there?
106	OK! OK, fine, we’re doing it! We’re going in!\nIt’s still creepy, but let’zzz get this trial going!
107	Another trial cleared and completed! Zzt-zzt!\nNow, let’s split. Aether House izzz a-waiting!
108	Izzz Yungoos gonna be OK? We’ve gotta find it!\nMy circuitzzz can’t take this kind of stress!
109	The infamouzzz Po Town... It’zzz a bit scary, but\nI guess we’ve got no choice but to search it!
110	The place izzz crawling with Team Skull Grunts!\nWatch yourself in here, my jammy friend!
111	I’ve got a bad feeling about thizzz place... Like\nthere’s something bad in the heart of Po Town...
112	You got that crazzzy quizzz right, clever kid!\nI knew you could! Now onto the boss’s room!
113	Huzzah! You beat that grody goon Guzzzma!\nNow let’zzz get outta this place!
114	Let’zzz go after Acerola!\nWe’ve gotta go back to Aether House!
115	Gladion wanted to meet up at the Malie City\nFerry Terminal, right? Let’s zzzip right over!
116	Zmmm... I feel thizzz weird, overwhelming power\ncoming from Nanu! Be careful if you take him on!
117	Be careful, my friend...and onto the elevator!\nWe’ve made it thizzz far together!
118	Zmmm! If you’re ready, better talk to Gladion.\nHe seemzzz to be calling the shots here!
119	They went and named their secret labs azzz...\nSecret Lab A and B? This place is bad newzzz...
120	Well, it looks like we’re headed for Secret Lab B!\nNever thought I’d have to say that... Zzzrt...
121	Better read all the documents you can find...\nWho knowzzz if we’ll ever get down here again?
122	Go after Hau! Don’t let him leave us behind!\nGet thozzze human clodhoppers moving!
123	We’ve got to get back to the elevator again!\nAnd quick! We’re clozzze to something big!
124	Gladion! Hau! Where are you, guys?!\nWe should all work together on thizzz, right?!
125	If you want to find Lusamine, we’ve gotta get\nto the entrance on 1F before it’zzz too late!
126	Zzz-zzt! Do you think Lillie izzz with Lusamine?\nThat izzz what Ms. Wicke said, right?
127	Well done, my brave companion!\nYou beat Guzzzma! Now let’s find Lusamine!
128	Zoinks! Go after Lusamine, like, yezzzterday!\nShe must have gone somewhere farther in!
129	Th-that Lusamine lady... She really scares me...\nAll humanzzz aren’t like that, right?
130	Feeling refreshed and ready for more, pal?\nLet’zzz head out and see what’s waiting for us!
131	Everyone is waiting where boatzzz come in!\nLet’s get out of this place!
132	Seafolk Village? That’s what thizzz izzz?\nHmm. Seems worth having a look around!
133	Keep on stomping around Poni Island, partner!\nThere izzz plenty to explore, that’s for sure!
134	Zrrmmm? I seem to be picking up signzzz of\nmore people and Pokémon in the Poni Wilds...
135	The Ruins of Hope are past Poni Breaker Coast!\nLet’zzz hope they’re cheerier than they sound...
136	In we go...to the Ruinzzz of Hope...\nAre they hopeful ruins? Or where hopes end?
137	Look at thozzze muscles! Push! Shove! Go!\nMachamp will get us through thezzze ruins!
138	Zzt! Don’t let Hapu leave uzzz eating dust!\nBack to Seafolk Village, on the double!
139	If we’re hoping the seafolk will give us a ride,\nthen I guess we should talk to their chief! Zzt!
140	I don’t know what we’ll find at the end of\nExeggutor Island. That izzz where we’re going!
141	I could keep exploring Exeggutor Island all day!\nLet’zzz find some more of those giant eggheads!
142	Lillie ran ahead somewhere! Where’d she go?\nAnd, uh, does she still get lost all the time?
143	The Vast Poni Canyon liezzz up the way from\nthe Ancient Poni Path where Hapu livezzz.
144	Can I admit something to you, friend? Truth is...\nI totally dig that Team Skull pose! Zz-zz-zzt!
145	Once more unto the breach! Or the canyon! Zzt!\nYou’d better be ready for Hapu’s grand trial.
146	The Vast Poni Canyon izzz a real beast of a\nplace, but we’ve got to get you through it! Zzt!
147	You OK, [VAR 1100(00FF,0707)]big boymy girl? Not too tuckered out?\nDon’t give up yet! We can do thizzz!
148	Lillie izzz sure doing her best, too, isn’t she?\nShe’s on fire and she lookzzz totally cool to me!
149	We can’t let Lillie outshine us, partner!\nLet’s get a move on, too! Zz-zz-zzzt!
150	Is there a trial in the Vast Poni Canyon?\nZrrmm... Isn’t the whole place trial enough?
151	What’s up with thizzz Vast Poni Canyon trial?\nDoesn’t it kind of remind you of Ilima’zzz trial?
152	You cleared another trial! But the real trial will\nstill be pushing on beyond thizzz point, I think!
153	Zoinks! Would you look at all thozzze stairzzz?!\nIf you make it up them all, you’ll reach the altar!
154	The time hazzz finally come! Make sure you and\nLillie both blow your flutezzz at the same time!
155	We can’t open up an Ultra Wormhole if Nebby\nizzz not here with us. Did you forget?
156	The Pokémon League should be way up at the\npeak of Mount Lanakila! Brr-rrr-zrrr-zzzr...
157	Mount Lanakila izzz famous for being the most\nimpregnable of all Alola’s various mountains...
158	Zzzzzzzzt! Do it, kid! Become the Champion!\nI’ve been with you all this time—I know you can!
159	Zzrm? A battle against Nebby, eh?\nDo your bezzzt to be found worthy as a Trainer!

3	Leave it to my talent!\nI’ll show you how prettily I can bloom!
4	Too bad... I didn’t have enough water...

26	Did you...maybe take it a little too easy?
27	Maybe I took it too easy...
28	If you’re with me, let’s take it easy. E-e-e-easy.
29	To be honest, maybe you take it easier\nthan I do.
30	Hey! That’s pretty cold!\nI told you to call me if there’s gonna be a battle!
31	Hey, what’s your deal? That’s it?
32	Hey, you’re a lot of fun!\nYou gotta call me next time, too!
33	Thanks for picking me! Let’s go all out!
34	Wha-a-at, that’s it? Call me again sometime!

46	Whoo! Justice! Justice usually wins!
47	*sniffle* The hero isn’t s’posed to lose...
48	The hero of justice has arrived!\nYou can leave it to me!
49	Doesn’t justice usually involve winning?
50	I still don’t have my own Pokémon.\nI borrowed my big brother’s Pokémon.
51	Ah... I won... I knew my big brother was great!
52	What do I do? My big brother’s Pokémon are...
53	I’ll give it my best shot with my\nbig brother’s Pokémon!
54	My big brother’s Pokémon are...\nI wonder if he’ll be mad at me...
55	Y’see me, thing is, I got no idea, y’know,\nwhy I’m here.
56	Just now, y’know, I got no idea, umm, what happened.
57	So yeah, I kinda, right now, got no idea what I’m doing.
58	So uhh, I got no idea, umm, why I was called.
59	So yeah, I, uhh, got no idea why, y’know, I gotta \ngo home.
60	The magic girl is here! I’m gonna discipline you!
61	Hee-hee! I’ll turn you into a Pokémon with my magic!
62	Waah! My magic isn’t working!\nThere’s something weird about you!

65	I dunno difficult stuff! But I’ll do my best!
66	I dunno difficult stuff! But I won!
67	I dunno difficult stuff! Izzat why I lost?
68	I dunno difficult stuff! But I’ll do my best!
69	I dunno difficult stuff! Must be why I lose!
70	Maybe you really think you c’n beat me?
71	Never in a million years, right? Ohoho! Ohohohoho!
72	What a cocky kid! I’mma tell my daddy on you!
73	Oh I got this! You can just sit back and watch!
74	It’s ’cause you didn’t go all out! Get it together!
75	I’ll try rully rully hard! You try hard, too!
76	I tried hard! You, too—keep trying, keep trying!
77	I tried rully hard! That’s all I got! That’s it!
78	I’ll try hard! That’s it!
79	I tried rully hard! You tried hard, too!
80	I’m OK with something casual right now!\nI want to experience romance again!
81	But I just came here thinking that\na nice, strong guy would be enough...
82	Love and travel are similar, aren’t they?\nAt a certain point, each must end.
83	I’m looking for a nice guy!\nYou’ve gotta help me out!
84	I didn’t find any nice guys...\nI’ll get my revenge next time...
85	Augh... My tummy is in pain...\nTo the extreme... Auugh...
86	Oooh... My stomach’s about to turn into a volcano...
87	Food and water poisoning are the true charm of travel,\naren’t they...
88	Augh... My tummy is in pain...\nThat’s a sign that I’m in good form...
89	My tummy pain is gone...\nMaybe that’s why we lost...
90	There was a bunch of stuff going on,\nand I ran away to this place.
91	Keep my secret, OK? I’ll never forgive you if you tell anyone.
92	It’s about time for me to change my face again.
93	Let’s do this quickly ’cause I don’t wanna\nstand out too much!
94	Come on, let’s leave quickly or someone\nwill see us...
95	Ugh...\nAfter all, in this region, too...
96	Huh...\nI’m so bored I can’t stand it...
97	Wherever I do stuff with Pokémon, there’s no real change\nfor the better...
98	I am pretty bored, so shall we do this together?
99	I actually wasn’t that bored! You’re pretty good!
100	I crossed a steep mountain range in coming\nhere from afar.
101	My Pokémon got toughened up through climbing.
102	The way of battle is like a mountain in that they’re\nboth steep climbs.
103	You calling me must mean that there’s a high\nmountain to climb.
104	We have to descend at one of the last stations,\nbefore reaching the top.
105	The tough guy of all tough guys!\nThat’s my nickname!
106	You wanna know why I’m strong? Because I’m a tough guy!
107	The tough-guy nickname...I guess you took it from me...
108	You called the tough guy! Sure! Leave it to me!
109	There’s nothing to worry about...\nYou were tough, too...
110	Yeah, boss! Is it time for battering practice?
111	Yeah! Yeah, yeah! Thanks for this, boss!
112	Yeah! Yeah, yeah! Thanks for that, boss!
113	Yeah, boss! I won’t be pushed out of the ring!
114	Yeah! Thanks for that!\nLet’s train again sometime!
115	I hate being fussy!\nI guess the brute-force approach really is best!
116	Battle is about pummeling and pummeling!\nScram if you’re weak!
117	Good, good! You’ve got a lot of physical strength!
118	OK, let’s hurry up and do it!\nLet’s power through this!
119	It’s unavoidable... The weak just fade away...
120	No, no, I’m not playing hooky!\nIt’s just a long lunch break!
121	I lose track of time when I’m here.
122	Ah, well... Guess I better be getting back...
123	My lunch break isn’t over, so keep me\ncompany for a bit.
124	OK, guess I better get back to work...
125	Hey! Hey, chief! Are you listening to me?!
126	Hey, what’s this, chief?! It’s too early for you to give out!
127	Good stuff, chief! Let’s go to another place!
128	Ah, that’s the chief all right!\nWe going to the next place?!
129	Sorry, chief! That’s it for me!
130	During work I’ve been sparing no effort to\nsteadily train!
131	The coexistence of work and Pokémon! That’s my dream!
132	The coexistence of work and Pokémon...\nThat must be a dream...
133	I finished up work early today!
134	Huh, it’s over already?\nBut I finished up early for this!
135	This is my first year as a working adult!\nIt’s my first year as a Trainer, too!
136	Huh, I guess you’re still a newcomer, too!
137	Seems like I’ve got a ton of stuff I’ve still got to learn...
138	I may still be a newcomer, but I’ll give it\neverything I have!
139	We’re both still newcomers, so there’s still\na lot ahead of us!
140	After five, it’s Pokémon battle!\nThat’s a smart woman’s etiquette!
141	Being strong in battle puts you on the fast track\nto promotion!
142	You won’t even play the good host to me?!\nThere’s no way you’re getting promoted!
143	Leave it to the smart woman!\nI’ll get you promoted, too!
144	You’ve gotten this far thanks to me!
145	This kind of battle is really just a break...
146	See? That was just play... It was totally useless...
147	That was slightly entertaining... Only slightly...
148	This is a break... It’s really just a break...
149	Well, it was only slightly so, but I guess that\nwas fun.
150	O-oh! Oh, oh! Y-you wanna tangle with me?
151	Heh... Heh, heh, heh... I did it... Me...
152	Oh! Don’t you come here again! No! Don’t come back!
153	O-oh! It’s been a while, huh? Leave this to me!
154	I-I did what I could! Don’t look at me like that!
155	Hunh?! What’s yer problem? You lookin’ at me?
156	I won’t go easy on ya just ’cause yer a whippersnapper!
157	When two sets of eyes meet, ya gitcha a one-on-one battle!\n’S what it is t’be a Trainer!
158	Yep! Leave it t’me!\nI’ll right near shoot the works!
159	I’m real sorry...\nI’m confident in my one-on-one battling but...
160	This is me... So I’ll get at it...
161	Hee-hee... With this, I, too...
162	Urgh... But why...
163	This is me... So I’ll get at it...
164	But it’s not my fault...
165	Huh? You think I’m a bad dude?\nNah, this is just fashion.
166	When it comes to Pokémon, too, Dark type is still the coolest.
167	Being a little bad is best ’cause you can be direct\nand popular.
168	Being a little bad makes you popular!\nThat’s my style!
169	If we had lost in a bit of a cooler way,\nwe would’ve been all set.
170	I’ve turned this bad because I wanted to be\ncalled a pixie.
171	Aren’t girls who twist guys and Pokémon\naround their finger the worst?
172	If your face and style are dull, you need other charms.
173	Oh, it’s been a while.\nBut I’m glad you called on me.
174	Of course I’m disappointed, but I tried my\nbest, really.
175	Gimme your Pokémon! Yeah, gimme right now!
176	You lost, so gimme! Gimme yer Pokémon!
177	Other people’s Pokémon are super appealing...
178	Aha! You’re gonna gimme yer Pokémon?\nNo? You wanna battle together?
179	Next time, you definitely gotta gimme\nyer Pokémon!
180	Hey, let’s get it going! ’Cause there’s no escape!
181	Not yet! Not by a long shot! Get up and come at me!
182	Nice! I’ve got a thing for you! You’re something else!
183	All right! Let’s go! Get psyched up!
184	Rather than feeling down after losing,\nyou gotta think about the next time! Right?
185	Hey-hey, here we go, right? You and me, yeah!
186	What! What, what! No way—it’s over already?!
187	No way... Whoa... That was way more than I thought...
188	Hey, here we go right now, yeah?\nYou and me, yeah!
189	It’s over already... Seems super early, right?
190	All right, here I go! I’mma knock it outta \nthe park!
191	There it goes! A big, big-tiiiiime home run!
192	...Ahhh. Guess I’m out.
193	You and me as the battery!\nWe’ll show the whole world!
194	Eh, some days you don’t have it and\nyou strike out.
195	...My bat is crying because it wants a hit\nso badly.
196	Oh boy, I got another boring hit...
197	Ack... A grounder... I don’t usually hit ground balls...
198	Perhaps you’d like to swap jerseys with me...
199	Three outs and time to change sides... A fielder\nuses a toothpick even when he hasn’t eaten...
200	When it comes to batting, you’ve gotta swing\nto get a hit.
201	See, you’ve gotta start by doing your daily practice swings.
202	In life, too, if you don’t swing, you won’t hit anything at all.
203	Oh, you’re fired up!\nOK, OK, let’s get it cranked up!
204	I swung with everything I had, so it’s OK\nwith me, even though I didn’t hit anything.
205	Get into my stance, then hit...\nGet into my stance, then hit...
206	I hit it... I got a hit...
207	Another swing and a miss...
208	Get into my stance, then hold my bat high...\nGet into my stance, then hold my bat high...
209	I ended up swinging and missing...
210	And now, for the final game! No way I’ll lose!
211	If you always feel your back’s against the wall\nwhen you battle, you’ll get results.
212	A sense of pressure is important for battling.
213	If you wanna form a duo with me, then we’re\naiming for the top!
214	It didn’t work out...\nThere wasn’t enough pressure...
215	All right!
216	Ooh! Yes!
217	Dang!
218	All right!
219	Dang!
220	Wa-hah-hah! Kneel before my Pokémon!
221	Whoa, you didn’t have to actually kneel! I just said that\nbecause I got excited.
222	Heh-heh! There you go! Well, I underrated you!
223	Wa-hah-hah! I can’t exactly pop right out when\ncalled, so I walked here.
224	Even though I did what I could, this is the result.\nEh, sometimes there are days like this.
225	Whoa! You’re my opponent! I’m a little stoked!
226	Oh! You OK? You’re barely breathing!
227	Oh! Your Pokémon are samurai! They’re super dangerous!
228	Whoa! You’re my partner! I’m really stoked!
229	There shouldn’t be any mistakes between you\nand me...
230	It’s summer all year round in Alola, so let’s\nenjoy a blazing battle!
231	Whew, I worked up a sweat!\nTime to head to the ocean for a dip!
232	Good-bye, summer!
233	You called me for a blazing battle, right?
234	You worked up a sweat, too!\nC’mon, let’s head to the ocean!
235	Whether it’s fun or not is up to your Pokémon.
236	Well, it’s happy and fun times to win, but I feel bad for\nyour Pokémon.
237	I lost, but that was fun! You and your Pokémon are fantastic!
238	Whether it’s fun or not is up to the two of us.

330	I used to be called a diamond in the rough,\nalthough that was decades ago.
331	I’m still a diamond in the rough! I’ll keep growing!
332	I aged while still in the rough, and now my diamond\nis tarnished.
333	The diamond in the rough is here!\nWell! The time for growth!
334	I guess, since I remained a diamond in the rough,\nit was my fate to be shattered into pieces.
335	Before I die, allow me to go all out\nin a Pokémon battle once again!
336	Aah... The thrill of rushing about...\nI don’t want to die for a long while yet!
337	Losing reignited my fire! The ending is still a long way off!
338	Before I die, I’d been wanting to form a duo\nwith someone once again.
339	I’m burning from my loss!\nRejuvenation complete!
340	Just fighting, even if I’m reduced to ash.\nIn short, that’s my path.
341	Winning or losing is worthless. I find meaning in how I fought.
342	Being reduced to ash, yet still fighting\nas ash, is the way of the Trainer.
343	Our way of life is, namely, our way of death.\nYou will pay keen attention to this on our side.
344	This is it: our life is our path, just\nmoving forward without any regrets.
345	Well! Here I come!
346	Pretty good skills... You should apply yourself...
347	The underdog has no mouth with which to speak...
348	Well! Here we come!
349	The losers simply fade away...
350	Aim for a hole in one!\nRoar, my driver!
351	Hnnn! An albatross!
352	Looks like I got a triple bogey...
353	Here’s my caddy! Get my driver!
354	Hey, caddy...I was a long way from the green...
355	Well, I couldn’t make it as a professional, so I’m\na lesson pro.
356	They’re not golf lessons. I’m giving Pokémon lessons.
357	You show promise. You could probably make it as a pro.
358	I’m working as a lesson pro, so I’m good at\nworking with others.
359	You’re good at working with others. You could\nprobably make it as a pro.
360	I started so I could welcome guests, but I got\ntotally hooked.
361	Unfortunately it costs a lot of money to play golf.
362	Don’t get the wrong idea—that was just my welcoming play.
363	I won’t say we have to welcome them.\nDon’t hold me back.
364	You’ll never succeed if you don’t become\nmore considerate.
365	I started just to keep my daddy company, but at\nsome point I became obsessed.
366	You have pretty good taste! Wanna go out with me?
367	I guess as your social relationships broaden, so do your\nhobbies. Heh.
368	My daddy’s not here today!\nSo let’s go together. ♪
369	Young kids really are different! Even if we lose,\nwe are still cheerful. ♪
370	You gotta shout when you swing!\nLike this: “Wonton noodles!”
371	Tempo is important for both golf and Pokémon!
372	Ph-phew!
373	Shout when you swing!\nLike this: “Wonton noodles!”
374	Argh! We lost because the timing of our\nshouting was off.
375	You’re my new caddy? You sure you’re cut out\nfor that?
376	Hey! You’re already done? What a wussy caddy!
377	Just as I’d expect from my caddy! I was right to hire\nyou on. ♪
378	OK! Let’s play a round! Let’s get fired up!
379	It wasn’t your fault, caddy. I wasn’t on\nmy game...
380	The Pokémon I raised will be tough for you to\ndeal with! You betcha!
381	I raised them with care! You betcha! Yeah, so they can’t be\nbeat! You betcha!
382	No way this could happen! You betcha! I messed up!\nYou betcha!
383	You and I will fight together to the bitter end!\nYou betcha!
384	I gave it everything I had! You betcha! I’ve got\nno regrets! You betcha!
385	I’ve raised a bunch of Pokémon, but I haven’t\nfound “the one.”
386	Raising Pokémon is, like, actually really difficult.
387	Seems like you’ve raised your Pokémon up really well.
388	These guys aren’t too impressive, but I leave\none to you.
389	It’s hard for me to say, but our result wasn’t\ntoo impressive...
390	Ohh... You look robust... Let this old-timer\ntrain you!
391	See, I’ve gotta train you! All right! C’mon over here!
392	Hold it! Don’t run away! Leave it to this old-timer!
393	All right! Let’s get going! Everyone’s gonna train\nwith this old-timer!
394	I got to do a lot of training, so I’m satisfied.\nLet’s all go training again sometime!
395	Please... Don’t tease the Pokémon I raised...
396	What do you think...? My Pokémon... Really cute, right...?
397	You’re awful. Awful... Please don’t harm others...
398	Please be considerate around the Pokémon\nI raised...
399	Why won’t you protect me...?
400	Caring for Pokémon from morning until night! It’s\ntough being a Breeder!
401	I wonder if there isn’t someone somewhere who will care\nfor me.
402	Just liking it isn’t enough to keep you going. In this job, you\ntake on life itself.
403	Oh! Are you gonna care for me?
404	Hey now! You just throw me away if we lose?!\nDoesn’t that seem just awful to you?!
405	I built up these muscles through work! You\nwanna check and see if it’s all for show?
406	*flex flex*
407	But using my muscles is what I do...
408	I built up these muscles through work! Just sit\nback and watch my team!
409	*flex flex*
410	I’m here studying as part of my training as a\nnew employee.
411	I’m learning how to win a battle without harming\nthe customer.
412	I’m learning how to lose a battle without getting annoyed.
413	This is duo training as part of my training as a\nnew employee.
414	I learned a lot. Thank you very much.
415	Huh? You want good service? Then aren’t you\nforgetting something?
416	Y’see, if you provide your service and sincerity for free,\nothers will take advantage of you.
417	Hey, hey, what about the tip! The tip! My livelihood depends\non that!
418	This time we’ll be partners, so you can relax\n’cause I don’t need a tip.
419	You’re really dedicated, aren’t you? You seem\ncut out for the service industry.
420	I got hooked on Pokémon battles to the\npoint that I lost everything.
421	Just like me, my friends also strayed from the path here.
422	Just having something I can get so into that I go a little nuts\nmakes me happy.
423	I spend more time here than I do at home.
424	I see you around pretty often, too... Pretty soon \nthere will be no turning back for us.
425	Excellently raised Pokémon are my specialty.
426	Raising them with the best food makes them the strongest.
427	You’re no gourmand, are you? I can’t do anything for those\nwith no taste buds.
428	I’m ready to cook up another challenge!
429	No... For us to have been eaten up with\nsuch relish...
430	You’re young so eat up. Yeah, don’t be shy!
431	I bet you could still eat! When you’re young, even if your\nstomach is bursting, you should just eat!
432	No need to chew! ’Cause food is really just a drink!
433	Hey! You’re younger than me, so it’s up to you\nto really chow down!
434	Whoops, I messed up. Next time I’ll give you so\nmuch food, you’ll be bursting.
435	I’m the cooking wizard! Time for me to get you\nprepped!
436	Nu-ha-ha-ha! All right! I’ll salt and pepper you up!
437	Nu-ha-ha-ha! I didn’t have all the ingredients I needed,\nso farewell!
438	It’s the advent of the cooking wizard! OK!\nI’ll whip up some BBQ!
439	Nu-ha-ha-ha! I’m tuckered out! All right!\nI’ll fix up a meal!
440	I’m a dude who’s always burning! Here I go!\nComplete combustion!
441	You’ve gotta burn, too! Burn, baby! This is no time\nfor smoldering!
442	You think it’s too hot?! Don’t tell the truth!
443	I’m a dude who’s always burning! Let’s go!\nComplete combustion!
444	You still think it’s too hot?! But I said it’s not\ncool to tell the truth!
445	Th-this line of work causes your family to worry\nabout you.
446	With this kind of dangerous job, having a steady relationship\nis kinda... Haha...
447	Well, I guess you could say that fire is my sweetheart right\nnow? Kinda? Ha, haha.
448	The job is the job, so I’m pretty used to teaming\nup with others.
449	It’s my fault for imagining what it would be like if\nyou were that girl I admire...
450	What’s your deal? You’d be OK with me\narresting you? That’d be OK, right? You’d be\r\nOK with that?
451	O-K! Arrested! This is the moment when I snap on the\nhandcuffs! Awe...some!
452	Hold on! Lemme arrest you! Even if it’s just a mistaken arrest!
453	Oh! It’s you! Let’s go make an arrest! Doesn’t\nmatter who it is. Let’s make an arrest!
454	The suspect who fled was huge, right? Let’s go\nmake another arrest sometime!
455	Since my grandfather’s generation, we’ve been\nPolicemen, but there aren’t any particular career\r\nopportunities in the field.
456	We begin as Policemen, and then it ends.
457	There are some Pokémon that can’t evolve. Their lives are\nalready determined when they come into the world.
458	Someone is curious about teaming up with a\nPoliceman. That person has\r\nweighty expectations.
459	Here, the journey ends.
460	Part of a justice squad! A Policeman has come!
461	No one can stand up to a Policeman! Penalty administered!
462	It’s a shame, but this Policeman must stop at this point.
463	A Policeman! Has come! Let’s go together!\nPolice kid!
464	Sorry! Police kid! It’s a shame, but I must stop\nat this point.
465	I’m a mad scientist! Modification is my hobby!
466	I’ll make you really strong! So it’s OK for me to modify\nyou, right?
467	You guys are really strong! Have you been modified?
468	I’m a mad scientist! Should we do\nmodification together?
469	You were unusually strong! You haven’t been\nmodified, right?!
470	I may not look it, but I’m an outdoors type and\nsurfing is my pastime.
471	I’m usually doing lab work, aren’t I? See, I just want to get\nsome sunlight.
472	If you don’t take in the sea breeze and the like, don’t you\nstart to get a little down?
473	Hey there! Sure. Leave it to me!\nI’m pretty confident!
474	OK then. Good work! I’ve gotta get on to the\nnext thing!
475	According to my data, in this match...I’ve got a\n98 percent chance of victory.
476	Data never lies... People, on the other hand...
477	M-my calculations were off?!
478	According to my data, with this duo...we’ve got\na 99 percent chance of victory.
479	Probabilities are probabilities... Just like\nunsteady people...
480	I’m jealous... You’re still a kid... I wish I could go\nback to that time...
481	I’ve become a corrupt adult, so I’m underhanded in\nbattles, too.
482	Where has that pure version of me from those days gone?
483	Let me get back that pure and innocent\nversion of me from those days!
484	There’s no hope for me.\nI’m already a tarnished adult...
485	I’ve trained 10 years for this day!
486	Nuhaha! The fruits of my training!
487	I’ve trained 10 years for this day...but I completely forgot\nto train my Pokémon.
488	I’ve trained 10 years for this encounter!
489	I trained day in, day out, and I completely forgot\nabout being social.
490	The wishes contained in my fist! I’ll convert\nthem to power and let them flow now!
491	As a Trainer, my skill is the only part of me that talks.
492	My spirit...didn’t quite measure up...
493	The fighting spirit that wells up in our breast!\nLet’s make use of it as we get this going!
494	I didn’t have the capability... Sorry...friend...
495	There are those who dance and those who\nwatch. Which describes your life, I wonder?
496	Anyway, when it comes to this transient life, I’m gonna\nbe dancing.
497	Is there meaning to being born to a life of just watching and\nempty words, I wonder?
498	Life is transient. Let’s bloom without\nfear of falling.
499	Thanks for the fun moment. If we’re alive\ntogether, let’s do this again.
500	Yeah, this is cosplay. I just wanted to be\nsomeone different.
501	I can look however I want to look. It’s not\nbothering anyone.
502	I spoke of being a different person, but I guess the regular\nme is here...
503	If we’re going to take the trouble, it would’ve\nbeen nice if you had also come in cosplay...
504	Next time we come here, let’s do\nmatching cosplay.
505	Dizzying dancing, hula dance. ♪\nSwaying side to side, I feel dizzy. ♪
506	I did pretty well...this time. ♪\nI managed to win. Hula dancer. ♪
507	I lost badly. Ugh, this is lame. ♪\nI’ll totter on home. I’m not home yet. ♪
508	Let’s dizzyingly dance, hula dance. ♪\nLet’s the two of us dance, round and round. ♪
509	I lost badly. Ugh, this is lame. ♪\nI’m sniffling, so comfort me. ♪
510	I’ll record my battle with you in a Battle Video!
511	I got some incredible footage! I’ll upload it to the net\nright away!
512	I can’t upload this current data to the net...
513	I’ll record our duo battle together in a\nBattle Video!
514	I don’t think I’m going to upload that data to\nthe net...
515	I’ll serve as the opponent for you. You can’t at\nleast thank me beforehand?
516	I served as the opponent for you. You don’t have any token \nof gratitude for me?
517	I-I was the opponent, you know! You can’t at least lose\nfor me?
518	I’ll join in a duo! No way we’ll lose, right?
519	I joined in the duo! I can’t believe this result!
520	I’ll defeat you, get a bunch of money, and\nbecome huge, so please allow this to happen.
521	It’s OK. Not everyone can be like me—someone who would \nput their life on the line for Pokémon.
522	I’m already shabbadabba—the show’s over for me. But I can’t\ndislike a person like you.
523	I’m here. You’re here. We’ve got some leeway.
524	I’m already shabbadabba—the show’s over for \nme. But I can’t dislike a fight alongside you.
525	If you win, I’ll tell you my most treasured secret...
526	That’s really too bad, isn’t it? My secret will remain a secret.
527	My secret... It’s in my name...
528	It’s a secret even to my partner, the mystery\nI hide.
529	That was close... I’ll head home, bearing\nmy secret.
530	Whoa! You seem super strong! With all this\nexcitement, let’s go!
531	Whoa! That was seriously intense! I’m shaking from\nthe adrenaline!
532	Whoa! That was seriously scary! My pulse is pounding!
533	Whoa! Haven’t seen you for a while! With all this\nexcitement, let’s go!
534	Whoa! I’m seriously out! I might pass out!
535	All right, let’s do this.
536	Yeah, good work.
537	Yep, you’re strong.
538	All right, let’s go.
539	OK, see ya.
540	Relax and leave it to me. I’ve got\nsome experience.
541	You learned something, right? Experience is important\nafter all!
542	My Pokémon and I were no match for you. You and your\nPokémon are more than you seem to be.
543	Leave it to me! I’ll show you something great!
544	I learned a lot! I won’t give up and I’ll\nkeep fighting!
545	There are two types of strength... The hard-\nworking type and the talented type.
546	Even if you work hard, you’re no match for my talent!
547	You’ve got talent and you work hard?!
548	You, the hardworking type, should just support\nme, the talented type.
549	Were we lacking in talent? Hard work? Or both?
550	Now I’m a scientist, but I used to be a doctor.
551	You must be willing to use moves if you want to understand\ntheir power.
552	As you might expect from someone who was a doctor,\nI’m not very good at hurting Pokémon.
553	Even if we lose, I’ll fix you up. I’m only partway\nthrough my research, though.
554	Good work, I’ll fix you up. I’ve got absolutely\nzero confidence that I can though.
555	If I had encountered Pokémon at an earlier point,\nmy life might’ve been much different.
556	While dealing almost wholly with machines, my heart froze up.
557	I’m tired of computers. I want a living companion.
558	If I had encountered you at an earlier point,\nmy life might’ve been much different.
559	Living companions are pretty great, aren’t they?
560	I love karate! Do you like karate?
561	I like Pokémon battles, too! But I like karate more!
562	I like karate! But I don’t like you!
563	I love karate! I’ll go at it with karate!
564	Oh... Didn’t do enough training...\nI’m gonna go do karate...
565	Mm!
566	Hm!
567	Nn!
568	Mm!
569	Rrr!
570	My hands are cramped and my feet are\nblistered, but still, I must dance.
571	I’ve got to work on my dancing skills to be the\nbest dancer.
572	Standing in front of people is a really daunting thing.
573	I can’t do too much, but I’ll at least cheer you on\nwith dance.
574	Was my dancing not good? I’ll dance well\nnext time.
575	If they watch me dancing, even Pokémon get\nreally excited!
576	Uh uh! Come on now! You can go a lot further!
577	You’re really pumped up, too! All right!\nAll-night dancing!
578	Let’s get pumped up and get at it!\nFollow my lead!
579	That wasn’t enough for me! Promise that you’ll\ncall me again!
580	Even I, an ordinary Collector, was able to join\nthe aces!
581	Heh... It’s tough, isn’t it...the ace title...
582	Alas! For me to be in this predicament, I bring dishonor to\nthe aces!
583	Leave it to me, Ace Trainer that I am!
584	Heh... We’re cowardly...you and I...
585	I shall break in this unknown junior Trainer.
586	Heh, heh... Maybe I’ll give you a candy after that whipping.
587	Hey there, that’s it, junior Trainer! Perhaps you want to\nbreak me in?
588	Unknown junior Trainer, I’ll form a tandem\nwith you!
589	The party ends here this time. Let’s get\ntogether again, junior Trainer!
590	Hunh... You... Somewhere, I’ve...
591	Huh... Who was that...?
592	I can’t remember... Even though I should know it...
593	Hunh... You again... Let’s see, you must be...
594	It’s no good... I can’t remember... Now, who were\nyou again...?
595	I must not forget my initial resolution! I’ll always\nhave that newcomer feeling!
596	Thanks! I’m grateful to you! I learned a lot!
597	Thanks! I’m grateful to you! Please treat me to\nsomething, mentor!
598	I must not forget my initial resolution! I’ll work on\nstaying fresh!
599	Thanks! Nice work! OK, that’s it for me!
600	Let’s not beat around the bush! I’m your\nopponent! Bring it on!
601	A Trainer who can’t win is worthless!\nLeave the ring...immediately!
602	Mercy is mockery of one’s opponent! Come on! Finish it!
603	Our mission is simple! Completely rout them all!
604	We didn’t achieve our goal! We’re disqualified as\nTrainers!
605	They’re my cherished friends, but don’t take it\neasy on them.
606	You were unlucky. With Pokémon, too, you have to wonder\nwhat they were born to do.
607	Making their friends fight is the calling of Trainers.
608	We must be prepared if we’re going to send our\ncherished friends into the ring.
609	Whether we win or lose, our Pokémon still get\nhurt. It makes you think, right?
610	You believe in them more than anything else...\nyour Pokémon...
611	You started to doubt your belief, didn’t you...\nThat’s why you lost.
612	Believing is good, isn’t it?
613	I believe...in you and your Pokémon...
614	Since this is the result of my believing in y’all, I\nhave no complaints about being in this state.
615	Here’s my scream! Oowhoaaaaa!
616	Here’s my scream! Yeah-gooooooood!
617	Here’s my scream! Guwhoaaaa!
618	Here’s my scream! Oowhoaaaaa!
619	It’s all over! Allllll riiiiiight!
620	I’m always able to mutter these feelings only\nafter I say good-bye.
621	This violent throbbing in my chest...\nyou must not be aware of it...
622	Bye-bye. Don’t look back... That back... I’ll never forget it.
623	Our meeting signals our parting. But we must\npress on.
624	This ceaseless, stirring refrain... I’ll still keep it\nto myself.
625	Oh, I get it, all right. You’re here for action, \nright? Fire it up! I’m so fired up!
626	I just barely won, but...this kid is something special...
627	Hey, what’s the story with you guys...?\nYour Pokémon are absolute monsters...
628	Oho! It’s you! This one’s fired up!
629	This kid’s definitely got a bright future! The\nfuture’s really something to look forward to!
630	With Pokémon I have long been living... With only\nPokémon I have long been living...
631	With only Pokémon I’ve been living, so that I’m strong\nis a given...
632	With only Pokémon I am living... My remaining years\nseem unforgiving...
633	With only Pokémon I am living...so human\ncompanionship I am missing...
634	This losing feeling sure is gloomy... I wanna go\nhome and get some snoozies...
635	I will not take you lightly. You better really\nbe ready.
636	Come now, can you even stand up? Your spirit and body\nhave been...
637	You are really impressive, Trainer... To have that kind of\nability is priceless...
638	The time has some for us to flaunt our abilities.
639	I am dissatisfied with the result, but we can\ndiscuss that some other time.
640	OK, my beloved Pokémon! Put the squeeze\non them!
641	That’s it, my Pokémon! The opponent is no longer at ease!
642	*squeeze*
643	OK, let’s put the squeeze on everyone!
644	*squeeze*
645	Being together, my Pokémon and I have no\nblind spots.
646	Really, you seem totally naive. What if you started over as\na baby?
647	It’s a fuzzy decision, but a loss... You absolutely reap what\nyou sow...
648	You and I as a pair...this will be an intense\ndevelopment.
649	What a sentimental battlefield... I’ll probably\npass out as soon as I get home.
650	I guess I’ll give it everything I’ve got so I have\nno regrets...
651	Hey, hey? You don’t have any regrets? Right? You’ve got no\nregrets, right?
652	I said I’d give it everything I had, but when you lose,\nyou have regrets.
653	Let’s give it everything we’ve got so we have no\nregrets with each other!
654	I gave it everything I had, but I have nothing\nbut regrets...
655	When you talk about the strongest, you’re\ntalking about me! I’m second to none!
656	There’s no way you can beat the strongest!\nI’m seriously amazing!
657	You beat me! Me, the strongest! How can I lose?!
658	When you talk about the strongest, you’re\ntalking about me! So just follow my lead!
659	There’s no way that the strongest could lose!\nIt must be your fault!
660	The pure and cute type is my everyday persona.
661	I can only be my true self in a place like this.
662	Creating a persona for life is comfortable but also\nconstraining, isn’t it?
663	Well, if you’re next to me, I can probably show\nmy true persona.
664	We lost, but that was still refreshing. Give me\nanother call sometime when you’re free.
665	Since when I was dumped by my boyfriend, I\nguess I’ve gotten stronger.
666	Even if I’m strong in battles, it’s meaningless if I’m\nnot popular.
667	Escapism is also more helpful than you’d think.
668	I’m gonna fight together with you? Well, I guess\nthat’s cool with me...
669	Like, when you’re next to me, I’m starting to\nfeel unpopular...
670	I wanna take over the world when I grow up.
671	You lost, so you can be my faithful servant.
672	If my dream comes true, there’s no way I’ll forgive you.
673	I’ll do my best together with you, my servant, so\nI can take over the world.
674	I’m going home! You go home, too, servant!
675	They call me a child prodigy, but that’s tough on\nme, since I’m still just a novice.
676	Just being naturally brilliant, it’s tough dealing with so\nmuch expectation.
677	It’s beyond annoying having to deal with the unfortunate\nexpectations of my parents and teachers.
678	I see that you’ve chosen me. Now we’ll see if I\ncan live up to expectations.
679	I’ve failed... I’ll apply myself, since I’m still\na novice.
680	My dad caught them for me. I dunno if\nthey’re strong.
681	Those Pokémon were strong. Thanks, Dad.
682	Those Pokémon were weak. My dad is dumb.
683	This time my dad caught strong Pokémon\nfor me.
684	They’re still weak. My dad is a stupid-head.
685	My mommy and daddy aren’t here, but I’m OK\nbecause of my Pokémon.
686	If all my Pokémon are around, every day is fun.
687	I’m gonna make my Pokémon a house when I get bigger.
688	My big brother and big sister aren’t here.\nThis is exciting.
689	Thanks, Traaaiiiner! You’re as cool as\nmy Pokémon!
690	I’ve found from taking constant journeys that\none’s life doesn’t change from those journeys.
691	Life does resemble a journey, but journeys are actually\njust journeys.
692	Life itself is a journey. Guess I’ve gotta get going somewhere.
693	Even though I haven’t figured out the point of\njourneys, for you to call wandering ol’ me...
694	It was just like we were on a journey together.\nThat’s what the battle was like. Thanks!
695	I’ve been constantly traveling for a number of\nyears, so there’s no region I don’t know about.
696	Hotels and the road are my home. I can go anywhere\nby myself.
697	I’d like there to be a dude around just for someone to simply\nsay “welcome home” to me.
698	I’ll show you the know-how I’ve developed from\ntraveling around the world.
699	...The barriers to battle are thicker than the\nbarriers of the world.
700	Sorry to keep you waiting. ♪ It’s time for the\nHiker to enter, who is an idol to some. ♪
701	I won’t let being in the minority get me down. ♪\nI gotta be me. ♪ And I am alive. ♪
702	I don’t need to be praised by others. ♪\nI can validate myself. ♪
703	Sorry to keep you waiting. ♪\nThe Hiker is here. ♪ Thanks for picking me. ♪
704	Sorry to bring you down... I’ll do better next time.\nSee you...
705	Finally, it’s my turn! I was totally sick of waiting!
706	After all that waiting, this is the result? You don’t have\nmuch guts, do you?
707	Pretty impressive that you were able to beat me! You’re\ngonna be big-time!
708	I was totally sick of waiting! You waited too long\nto call me!
709	Didn’t have enough guts... I should eat\nsomething that gives me stamina...
710	Can you get ahead by working hard? Seems like\nthat’s not the kind of era we’re in.
711	If I don’t do things halfheartedly enough, I look like a fool.\nYou would, too.
712	You’ve gotta preserve your personal life, or you’ll have no \ntime for romance, y’know?
713	Set a record by fighting intensely? That\nmight be appealing to the person I like...
714	This is nice because it’s fun. I don’t care about\nany records.
715	I was so busy with work that I neglected to care\nfor my Pokémon...
716	OK, time to head home and give them their due care.
717	See, they betray you if you don’t pay attention to them! The\nsame is true for people or Pokémon.
718	I haven’t been caring for them lately, so I \nwonder if my Pokémon will listen to me...
719	Yep, they just totally pouted. Don’t let that\nhappen to you...
720	What’s important at work is to be halfhearted,\nbut in a good way.
721	As long as I’m emotionally prepared, my victory is assured.
722	Not just working hard but managing things well is what\nmakes a grown-up. ♪
723	I’ll give ya some tricks for making it through\nsociety e-z!
724	If you lose and get irritated each time, you’ll\nlook silly. Watch out for that.
725	When I’m tired and go home, only Pokémon make\nme feel welcome in that dark room.
726	These little guys are my support. I can’t live without ’em.
727	I’m Pokémon dependent. But even so, it’s better than\nbeing alone.
728	I’m so dependent on Pokémon that I’m kinda\nawkward with people.
729	This battle was kind of a rehabilitation, I guess.
730	Ladies and gentlemen, step right up!\nI am rubbish!
731	It’s been 10-plus years since I was born saying, “goo goo\nga ga!” I walk the rubbish-filled highways!
732	I was born to rubbish and I adhere to rubbish! My scattered\nthoughts are due to rubbish!
733	Oh! Sorry to keep you waiting! This rubbish\nrushed here!
734	This rubbishy result is because of rubbish!\nIt’s no fault of yours!
735	I’ve got more than enough of every kind of\nbadness, but I don’t mess with Pokémon.
736	Messing with Pokémon stoops below even what brutes do.
737	For real though, I feel so bad for the Pokémon that I don’t\nlike battles.
738	...Oh, I guess you called me. Cool, let’s do this\nthen, I guess.
739	Why couldn’t we wreck those Trainers? If we\nhad, then our Pokémon wouldn’t have to suffer.
740	If you’ve got a goal, it’s no time to worry about\nhow you achieve it.
741	You might have to be cowardly, because it’s meaningless if\nyou can’t achieve results.
742	Heh heh heh. Those were some pretty underhanded\nmethods...but that’s what it is to be a Trainer.
743	I’m not picky about how I do it.\n’Cause I want results.
744	I’m still way too soft, too... I’ve gotta get way\nmore underhanded...
745	I was brought up with tender care, and I became\na fool with flying colors.
746	For you to lose to me, you must also be kind of—
747	I don’t hold any grudges toward anyone, but my foolishness\ncan’t be cured.
748	For you to pick this pathetic-looking fool... Could\nit be that we are birds of a feather?
749	This is what happens when you pick a fool, but\nyou were also pretty considerable.
750	Feels like it’s the bottom of the ninth! I’ve gotta\nget a hit. When will I get a hit?!
751	Aah... Can you hear them? The cheers of admiration for me...
752	I wonder if this will be my retirement...
753	I’ll show you how I can hit in this game! You’ll be\nmy coach!
754	C’mon, I said you were the coach... Now I’ll\nhave fewer highlights...
755	I’m announcing it right here! This battle!\nI’ve got it!
756	Hahaha! Just as I announced! A perfect victory for me!
757	I shouldn’t make any promises I can’t keep, like\nannouncements or declarations.
758	I’m announcing it right here! I’m your teammate!
759	It was just as I announced! Well, it was a\nperfect defeat!
760	I took up tennis for the sake of losing weight,\nbut I ended up—
761	Argh, I can’t lose weight. Just moving makes me eat.
762	Like, I keep putting on muscle, so I’m honestly a bit macho.
763	In tennis terms, we’re playing doubles.\nThat’s our relationship.
764	Your footwork is so light... What do you do\neach day...?
765	Look at that cute face... I’ll mess it up for you!
766	There ya go! Bend that cute face even more! There ya go!
767	When I see a cute kid, I can’t help but want to tease them.
768	All right! Let’s go mess up cute kids together!
769	Even when we lose, the fact that you’re stewing\nnext to me...I’m fine with that.
770	I just came here nonchalantly, without anyone\nexpecting anything of me.
771	But there may be meaning and value to carrying on.
772	My ability to continue ends here, and I guess I do, too.
773	I’m only capable of acting nonchalantly, so I\nhope that won’t bother you.
774	That’s the extent of my ability. I appreciate\nyour partnership.
775	The Pokémon I raised aren’t all like yours.
776	The battle begins from the stage of raising Pokémon.
777	That’s how my Pokémon are...\nYou’re a worthy connoisseur, too.
778	I’m OK with pitching in with the Pokémon\nI raised.
779	Those were pretty well raised, too. I couldn’t\nhelp but lose to them.
780	I’m OK with crying now as long as I’m able to\nhave the last laugh.
781	I’ll be able to rejoice much later. I’m aiming for\nsomething higher.
782	If I convert my frustration to hard work, I’ll surely\nget stronger.
783	Be with me now so we can have the last laugh.
784	Let’s remember this loss so we can aim\nhigher, together.
785	Rather than following an unlikely possibility, I’ve\ngot to know my limitations.
786	However hard I work, my limit is Rising Star.
787	I can’t trust people who speak of hopes and dreams.
788	Despite knowing my own limitations, I’ll try hard,\nso relax.
789	This is the limit for a Rising Star.\nSorry about that.
790	Hey, I bought souvenirs!\nI bought a ton of them!
791	I absolutely adore shopping! I’m a shopping fool!
792	Gotta buy! I’m gonna buy more right after this! I wanna buy so\nmuch stuff that the shop has to shut down!
793	Hey, I’ll battle! I’ll battle a ton for you!
794	I absolutely adore battles! I’m a battling fool!
795	I came on a bargain-priced tour, so the vacation\natmosphere is just about zero.
796	Buy cheap and you waste your money! That’s really well said.
797	Being here is my part-time job, and I’ve gotta make money or\nI’ll have no lodgings!
798	I’m here on a bargain-priced tour, so I can’t even\ngo to tourist spots.
799	The trailer towed by a bicycle hasn’t come to\nmeet me, so I’m not busy. Call me again, OK?
800	I’ve come here on my honeymoon to battle!\nI’m beyond saving!
801	My husband ran off a long time ago! But I’m having fun, so I’m\nOK with it!
802	It’s so fun that I can’t hold back! I guess I’m just a\nhopeless case!
803	My husband ran off since I’m always in battles,\nso I’ve been looking for my next partner.
804	I haven’t done enough battling by a long shot!\nDo you want to have another battle?!
805	Oh, I spent some money! I got totally into buying\neverything up!
806	I’m still gonna do a bunch more shopping! I won’t be able to\nbring it all home, but I’ll still buy it!
807	My trunk is stuffed with souvenirs! But I’m still gonna buy\nlike crazy!
808	Oh, I threw some Poké Balls! But I still wanna\nthrow more!
809	My arm is swollen from throwing so many\nPoké Balls! But I still wanna throw more!
810	I’m a clean freak, so the job I have now is\nmy calling.
811	The way I am, I can’t stand even a speck of dust, so my\nfamily suffers.
812	I scrub my Pokémon three times a day so they shine.
813	I’m a clean freak, so I demand cleanliness in\nmy partner.
814	One of our opponents was unclean, so\nI panicked.
815	I will judge whether you are unclean!
816	Uh-oh! You are unclean! I sentence you to\npunishment—cleaning!
817	Safe! You are pretty clean! But I sentence you to\npunishment—scrubbing!
818	Let’s you and I judge together whether the\nworld is clean!
819	Unfortunately, everyone is clean...\nThat’s really pretty boring...
820	Pokémon battles are popular at my work site, so\nit’s causing me trouble.
821	It’s OK if it’s just a momentary fad, but it’s really interfering\nwith work.
822	Even I, the foreman, am hooked. So frankly, we’re really\nbehind on the construction schedule.
823	I came because you called, even though I’m\nactually in the middle of work.
824	Well...result aside, I’m afraid to head back...
825	You risk your life being a Worker, but it’s\nplenty fulfilling.
826	I’m happy that I was able to boast of my work to you.
827	There’s a spirit of adventure to constructing buildings and\nbridges that last 100 years, isn’t there?
828	I’m by myself working away from home\nright now, so I’m glad you called.
829	Now I have a good yarn to tell to the kids in my\nhometown.
830	Palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, and\naged eyes... I’m like a department store full of\r\nchronic diseases.
831	“Old but still healthy” is like calling oneself a cyborg, if you\nask me.
832	Hospital? There’s no way I’ll go! I bet my character\nwould crumble.
833	I’ve got high blood pressure, thinning hair, and\nold-person odor, but leave this to me.
834	Since I’m always at my limit, I can’t really get any\nmore worn out now.
835	I’ve got money to burn and I’m quite popular: I’m\na winner.
836	Do I look happy? I’m actually not.
837	I’ve had bad luck only with Pokémon. The ones I have\nwith me now are borrowed.
838	While the Pokémon I have are borrowed, I got \nthem from a good place.
839	In the end, this might be the limit when it comes\nto another person’s Pokémon.
840	Aging gracefully takes a lot of behind the\nscenes work.
841	Through unseemly struggle, somehow I look the way I do now.
842	Don’t give me that look like, “I’m not interested in what this\nold lady has to say.”
843	Oh, I haven’t heard from you in a while. You \nmust want to hear what I have to say.
844	Don’t give me that look like, “It must be this old\nlady’s fault.”
845	Winners and losers arise from battle.
846	You can become stronger by understanding the frustration of\nthe loser.
847	Your expression is like, “I’m not interested in what this old\nperson has to say...”
848	Once again, we’re at the point where winners\nand losers arise from battle.
849	It seems like maybe you have an expression like,\n“It must be this old person’s fault...”
850	You smile with your face while you weep in your\nheart. That’s the service industry for ya.
851	The smile of the service industry is simply business.
852	The corpse of one’s tattered pride is the source of the\nbest hospitality.
853	I’m in the service industry, but I won’t flatter\nmy partner.
854	We provided service to the opponent. This, too,\nis the nature of the industry.
855	There are no Pokémon allowed at my hotel.
856	If the number of customers with no manners increases, you\nstart to feel constrained.
857	There are so many customers who just let their Pokémon do\nthis or that.
858	Let’s fight, while following the rules and\nmaintaining our manners.
859	We got too caught up in manners and left them\nan opening.
860	Since I got super into golf, I picked up the habit\nof doing practice swings.
861	I do practice swings even in my room, so my furniture gets all \nmessed up.
862	I have more fun doing practice swings than getting onto the\ncourse right now.
863	Since I got super into golf, Pokémon battles are\nkinda meh.
864	I think golf suits me better after all.
865	Point-blank, the hips are common to Pokémon\nbattles and golf!
866	There’s not enough swing in your hips! Twist more! Twist!
867	The swing in the hips decides the battle! All right, furiously\nswing with your hips!
868	I’m particular about motion in the hips! You\nbetter watch out!
869	It’s ’cause there wasn’t enough swing in our\nhips! We’ve gotta go at it more furiously!
870	Women have their weapons! Pokémon have\ntheir weapons!
871	You, too—you’ve gotta get your own particular weapon.
872	Is your weapon maybe your partnership with your Pokémon?
873	Those with their own weapons can\nseize victory.
874	You were honestly great. I was the weak link...
875	Rather than tedious words, we should speak\nwith our arms!
876	Don’t make fun of me for my slender arms. They are how I\nmake my living!
877	Is it seriously possible that I can’t hack it? Hey, what exactly\ndo you do?
878	We’ve got no time for tedious talk! Yeah! Let’s\nget fired up!
879	Our two-person combination... That’s an issue\nwe need to address...
880	Milk production is down this year, so my farm is\nin trouble.
881	I’ll have to go to town to work, or it’ll be tough to get by\nthis year.
882	In a business with living creatures as partners, it’s pretty\ntough to read the future.
883	Even though my farm is in trouble this year, I\nfound myself coming here.
884	Even though I know I need to go and work away\nfrom home, it’s so fun here that I don’t go.
885	Milk production is up this year, so it’s all smiles\nat my farm.
886	There’s certainly some risk in a business with living\ncreatures as partners.
887	I’ll be able to live a life of ease this year. Maybe I’ll even get a\nnew car.
888	It’s all smiles at my farm this year, so I’m able to\nspend my time at play.
889	If I live idly like this, next year’s figures will\nbe terrible.
890	Stop in and have a look at these\nextraordinary Pokémon!
891	Whaddya think? Great Pokémon, aren’t they? Why don’t you\nbuy one?
892	Whoa, hey! Don’t mess up the merchandise!
893	My extraordinary Pokémon! Let’s get down\nto business!
894	They’re not selling at all... What’s wrong\nwith them...?
895	C-come on! Quick! Bring it on!
896	Wh-what? I win sometimes!
897	O-OK! I gave it everything I had!
898	H-here we come! ’Cause we’re coming on fast!
899	Wh-what? That look! I gave it everything I had!
900	O-OK! Shall we let loose, splashily,\naround here?
901	Fiiiirrrre!
902	Ugh... Ughhhh... What happened?
903	O-OK! Shall you and I let it all loose?
904	Ughh... I’m fine... You go on ahead of me...
905	Ah, when was the last time...I met a Trainer\nlike you...?
906	That dreaming-of-the-future look... It’s tough for me just to\nlook at you...
907	I’m sure that you, too, will figure it out eventually...\nThe “future”—there’s nothing...
908	It’s a little tough for me to have to join up with a\nTrainer like you.
909	To not give up despite losing... That kind of look\nis hard for me to take...
910	You mean you don’t know about me?! I’m \nexperienced, so I hate dealing with newbies!
911	After this, have I been etched in your mind?
912	To lose to a little newbie... I myself feel like I have sunk...
913	You know about me, right? So relax!
914	To lose to that lot of newbies... We ourselves\nfeel like we have sunk...
915	Let’s just say that it’s rare for there to be a\nTrainer who can beat me.
916	See? Just like I told you! I’m pretty strong!
917	It had been a while since I’d lost! You’re pretty good!
918	If you’re a Trainer who’ll partner up with me, you\ngonna get pretty revved up out there?
919	You did pretty well! Call me again sometime!
920	You must be my opponent! OK! Come on with it!
921	Take it to heart! The true strength of a Collector!
922	Hoohaha! Not bad! I can accept you as my rival!
923	Hoohaha! My rival! Well then, onward!
924	Hoohaha! I’ve gotta stop! I look forward to\nnext time!
925	...Draw.
926	Heh...
927	Ack!
928	...Guess I’ll come.
929	Ack!
930	Feels like that ace label keeps dogging me...
931	Whew... With this, I was able to retain my ace label...
932	I’ve had it! This stupid ace thing! Even though I’d be fine\nwith being ordinary!
933	I’ve got the ace label! You’ve gotta help\nme out!
934	No! I wasn’t to blame! But then again, neither\nwere you!
935	I appreciate this!\n...Even though I’m off, it’s a regular customer...
936	That was really instructive!\n...I’ve seriously gotta try to be nice...
937	As expected, you’re quite strong!\n...This is just my business smile...
938	I appreciate this!\n...It’s that regular customer again...
939	I’m sorry, I wasn’t strong enough.\n...Well, I did what I could...
940	I’ve tried training in admiration of a hero I saw\nwhen I was a kid...
941	Ah... I’m really an incurable fool...
942	In reality, there’s no need for so-called heroes.
943	You resemble the hero I used to admire...
944	So-called heroes are really useless after all...
945	As long as my skin is elastic enough to make\nwater bead off, I’ll insist I’m a Beauty. ♪
946	Skin care after the battle! You better do it, too!
947	How to look like a Beauty... That’s my main issue in life...
948	Leave it to me, I who look exactly like a Beauty,\neven though I’m a Veteran. ♪
949	Oh no... These crow’s-feet... I’ve got to take care\nof them immediately...
950	...!
951	...!
952	...?
953	[~ 953]
954	[~ 954]
955	Show it to me—the true power of the first\nChampion of Alola!
956	This is what I, Kanto’s top-level Trainer, can really do!
957	How did I lose? You really are the real deal!
958	[~ 958]
959	[~ 959]
960	The winner takes everything, and there’s\nnothing left for the loser.
961	If somebody wins, the person who fought against that person\nwill lose.
962	When one loses, they lose everything... The next thing I’ll look\nfor will be victory, too!
963	I’ll follow my role until I’m able to serve as\nyour partner.
964	I was unable to fulfill my role... All I can do is\ndeeply apologize...
965	Being here somehow makes me nostalgic...\nI remember those days...
966	That was fun... Thank you...
967	Your talent...it’s real.
968	Well, I have let up on my mission, so I’ll join up\nwith you.
969	The result aside, it was a good fight.
970	I trained in Hoenn to take on the world. Please\nhave a look at my results!
971	Let’s battle again sometime!
972	I’ve lost...
973	I hope you can bear with me, Champion!
974	...Still, don’t you count on us just losing to\nyou forever.
975	I’m glad! I’ll be able to bring out the power of\nPokémon by battling you!
976	I’ll file away info on this fighting style of yours!
977	Splendid! You are quite the Trainer!
978	The secret for bringing out the power of\nPokémon! I’ll learn it from you!
979	Seems like the wearable I’m so proud of wasn’t\nfunctioning well, right?
980	I, Cynthia, accept your challenge! There won’t\nbe any letup from me!
981	Even if you lose, never lose your love of Pokémon.
982	No matter how fun the battle is, it will always end sometime...
983	If I fight alongside you, I can learn everything\nabout you!
984	How frustrating! It ended before I could\nunderstand you and your Pokémon!
985	I don’t believe that people understand each\nother if they battle, but I’ll face you anyway.
986	I’ve got pride, too. I mean, I was in Team Skull.
987	Yeah, yeah, you win... You’re really a big deal!
988	I can’t believe I’m teaming up with you... I’m not\nsure why fate has brought us together, but\r\ndon’t let me down!
989	Aww, what’s wrong? Could it be that the\nChampion is not very good at the Battle Tree?
990	Doesn’t matter who I’m up against, I’m gonna\nbeat them down! That’s what big bad Guzma is\r\nall about!
991	Not yet! I could still keep wrecking! Come at me\nas many times as you want!
992	I guess that’s how it is, Champion! But I’m not beat down yet!
993	Heh, I like the looks of this! If it’s you and me,\nwe can beat anyone down!
994	Yeah, when it comes to you and me, we’re best\nat wrecking each other!
995	I’ll fully display the vaunted dancing of\nmy Pokémon!
996	Win or lose, there’s never enough dancing!
997	Win or lose, there’s never enough dancing!
998	If we are truly strong, surely we can win even if\nwe dance as we please!
999	Sorry! I need to keep practicing my dancing...
1000	Thanks for stopping by! Here’s today’s\nMallow Special!
1001	You taste defeat when you can’t draw out the\nexcellence of your Pokémon.

88	“The Egg Watch”\nIt looks as though this Egg will take\na long time yet to hatch.

0	Alola! Check out my cute Pokémon!
1	Huh! You’re kinda strong, aren’t you?
2	If you see a Pokémon Trainer, you’ve gotta show\noff the Pokémon you like!
3	Hey, let’s battle!
4	Oh, right!
5	I just really like Pokémon, so win or lose,\nI’m happy.
6	I heard something good happens if you battle \nanother Trainer!
7	Hey, losing isn’t something good!
8	I guess the something good was that I got to \nmeet you through the battle!
9	Hey, Pokémon Trainers always seem to be \npeople who like Pokémon, right?\r\nIsn’t that strange?
10	I got it!\nYou must love Pokémon, too!
11	Even if a Pokémon doesn’t like you,\nif you tell it that you like it every day,\r\nit will grow to love you!
12	When you stay up at night, don’t you\nget sleepy?
13	I’m not getting enough sleep!
14	There are Pokémon that can sleep and recharge\neven while battling!
15	Hoooo-wah!
16	Hoooo-wah!
17	Hoooo-wah!
18	What? It’s already over?!
19	What? It’s already over?!
20	What? It’s already over?!
21	Aww, man!\nI wanted to show off my Pokémon’s best side more!
22	Aww, man!\nI wanted to show off my Pokémon’s best side more!
23	Aww, man!\nI wanted to show off my Pokémon’s best side more!
24	Sensational!
25	To think that you’ve wounded my pride,\nwhich is harder than diamonds!
26	[~ 26]
27	[~ 27]
28	Yo, I’m feelin’ mad annoyed that my team just got destroyed.
29	For real?!
30	Oh!\nThat’s game and set, isn’t it?
31	Ahaha! I dunno ’bout tactics and stuff ’cause I haven’t been \ndoin’ my homework.
32	Whoa! Well played!
33	Ah! Won’t be as close t’ my Bonsly...
34	When the eyes of Pokémon Trainers meet,\nit’s time to battle!
35	I lost! But that was still exciting!
36	I’ll raise my Pokémon by making ’em battle!\nSo someday I’ll be able to look you in the eyes!
37	Let’s go!\nKneecaps!
38	Aww...\nBrought to my knees.
39	I gotta catch more Pokémon!\nPokémon with cool knees are so neat.
40	[~ 40]
41	[~ 41]
42	[~ 42]
43	Hey! Please battle me!
44	If you’re strong, please go away!
45	Great Trainers can sense promise in\nother Trainers!\r\nDid you pick up on anything?
46	Alola! Whaddya think?\nI’m pretty good at greetings, huh?\r\nI’m also great at Pokémon battles!
47	Oh! No!
48	The awesomeness of your Pokémon!\nYou should take on the world!
49	I’m looking for Berries to have my\nPokémon hold!
50	Oh! If only I had given Butterfree a Berry\nto hold...
51	Berries lie at the base of trees.\nAfter all, that’s why they are Berries!
52	Each Pokémon possesses an Ability.\c\nUnderstanding these well leads to victory!
53	I couldn’t show off the effects of Abilities?!
54	There are many kinds of Pokémon Abilities—\c\nsome that produce effects in battle, and some\nthat produce effects at other times!
55	I’ll draw out the power of my partner,\nGrowlithe, by giving it an item to hold!
56	Being a Trainer, I myself should also have\nused an item!
57	The item you want a Pokémon to hold will\nchange depending on how you want it to fight!
58	Do you have preferences about the type of\nmoves in addition to the type of Pokémon?
59	More preferences, please!
60	There is a type for moves, just like there is\na type for Pokémon.\c\nWhen the move type is the same as\nthe Pokémon type, it’s more powerful!
61	Oh! You look comfortable on your Pokémon!
62	Oh! You look comfortable with your Pokémon!
63	While it’s also good to ride Pokémon,\nI like swimming with Pokémon.
64	Life came from the sea!
65	I want to dive into the sea!\nI’m so ashamed that I want to dive!
66	Youngsters evolve into Swimmers.\nJust kidding!
67	All right! Come battle a lady!
68	Argh!\nYou’re way too strong!
69	Pokémon seem happy when they get to fully \nunleash a move!
70	The swaying makes my heart sway, too...\nOh yeah, let me introduce my Pokémon.
71	That move, this move...\nI’m so confused...
72	When I float with my Pokémon between the \nwaves, my heart dissolves into the world...
73	My favorite bikini makes Pokémon happy, too!
74	It’s tough fetching Poké Balls from my bikini!
75	My favorite bikini makes Pokémon happy, too!
76	Wearing that getup seems too hot!\nHave a good sweat in a battle!
77	My Pokémon and I are in a cold sweat from losing...
78	In Alola, it’s totally normal to wear a bikini\nfrom morning ’til night!
79	When I come to the Pokémon cemetery...\nit’s no good because I get so mournful.
80	I...I’ll try to hold back my tears.
81	He’s still alive in my heart...\nMaybe that is enough.
82	I’ll use the moves it was so good at!
83	Pikaa...
84	The grave where Pikachu rests...\nI address it using its words.
85	Here, the Pokémon that was my family rests.\c\nHowever, rather than being mournful,\nI endeavor to present myself as cheery.
86	Makuhita!\nYou can’t sleep, too!
87	Resting in this grave is the comrade of the \nMakuhita that just fought.\c\nThey truly were like parent and child...
88	Is it cool for me to be in Team Skull if I’m this brittle?

96	For real?!\nOver already?!
97	Yes! You have emerged victorious!
98	Yes! You have emerged victorious!
99	Yes! You have emerged victorious!
100	I’d like to help out as a Trial Guide.\nBut I don’t wanna give you an easy win!
101	I crammed Pokémon in my backpack,\nbounced around, and now I’m here!
102	Whoa, looks like I’ve been visited by defeat!
103	I’ve been traveling everywhere, too, so I totally\nget how fun the island challenges must seem!
104	I am a Fisherman.\nIn short, I’m a person who fishes for Pokémon!
105	I can’t stand being caught!
106	A person who fishes can be called an angler\nor a Fisherman.
107	[~ 107]
108	[~ 108]
109	[~ 109]
110	Fishing is a path...\c\nIt’s a battle to win against oneself\nin addition to the Pokémon.
111	Even if I can win against myself, it looks like I’ve\nlost to you!
112	I calmly wait for the “!” to appear, no\nmatter how much fuss the Pokémon puts up!
113	When the fishing line has been cast,\na sucker may come along wanting to battle...\r\nEr, a Trainer will be hooked!
114	Maybe I, myself, became the sucker?
115	Having a Fishing Rod is fun because it allows\nyou to meet both Pokémon and Trainers!
116	The keeper of Ten Carat Hill!\nIt’s refreshing to be overcome!
117	I’ll teach you some tricks that guarantee\nhooking some Pokémon!
118	I’m not sure I need to teach you any\nfishing tricks.
119	If you don’t give up until you catch something,\nyou’ll definitely catch a Pokémon.\c\nIn Pokémon battles as well, if you battle\nuntil you win, you’ll definitely win.
120	I am a Collector.\nWhich is to say that I collect Pokémon.
121	Gimme gimme!
122	Collectors are happy beings.\c\nEven if there are no Pokémon we want,\njust our imagination can make us smile.

129	I rely on apps for traveling recommendations!
130	I guess I still haven’t mastered the recommended Rattata.
131	It’s a mystery as to whose recommendation it is,\nbut Paniola Ranch is apparently really nice.
132	I think you need to train your Pokémon.
133	How wonderful!
134	You should speak up in advance when\nthere’s nothing a Beauty could teach you.
135	When you speak of the Youngster Anthony, I’m\nthe only one in the Alola region!
136	You beat me, the only one like me in Alola,\nso you’re great!
137	When I think about it, you, too, are all alone in\nthe world.\r\nHold on a sec... How great is that!
138	[~ 138]
139	[~ 139]

141	I’m a Breeder!\nI raise and breed Pokémon!
142	I’m a Breeder!\nI’m sorry for losing!
143	I’m a Breeder!\nI recommend the Pokémon Nursery!
144	[~ 144]
145	[~ 145]
146	[~ 146]
147	Pokémon and Trainer join forces to make a team.
148	Ah! I’ll swim, too...\nEr, I want to compete together!
149	I want to win a swimming relay, not as Trainer\nand Pokémon but as members of the same team.
150	Welcome to my mini-island.
151	I-I lost.\nBecause I won’t budge!
152	Well, I guess you can stay\nhere too on my mini-island.
153	Swimming is full-body exercise!\nIt’s toned muscle tactics!
154	Toned muscle flexes spontaneously.
155	Muscle is important for Pokémon, too!\c\nIt’s the muscles, not the brain, that decide\nwhich move to use in battle!
156	Oh come onnn...\c\nI wonder where I can go to spend time alone\nwith my Pokémon.
157	You’re actually not a bother.\nThanks for a little excitement.
158	Pokémon that don’t say anything\nare perfect for me right now...
159	Alola Trainers have a different charm than those in Kalos!
160	New encounters help people and Pokémon grow\nand mature!
161	Nice! How’d you come up with that kind of battle plan?\nYou gotta tell me!
162	Nice! How’d you come up with that kind of battle plan?\nYou gotta tell me!
163	Nice! How’d you come up with that kind of battle plan?\nYou gotta tell me!
164	How annoying!
165	Bone-dry!
166	I was unprepared! Perhaps I did not put\nenough emotion into the dance.
167	Wr-wr-wr-wrecked!
168	Maybe I should be more selfish since\nit’s a Battle Royal!
169	It was well fought and I lost fair and square, yeah.\nThat was excellent. I feel great. Woo!
170	There was so much to think about that I got all mixed up...\nbut that was a blast!
171	There was so much to think about that I got all mixed up...\nbut that was a blast!
172	There was so much to think about that I got all mixed up...\nbut that was a blast!
173	Hmph...\nSo I failed to keep things under control again?
174	My emotions...\nI guess I was unable to convey them.
175	[~ 175]
176	Yo, yo, you...you’re no joke.
177	Phooey.
178	How lovely.
179	One plus one is two, but it could also be three\nor four.
180	I’m too young for math!
181	There are some Trainers who will challenge you\nas a pair, like us.
182	You’ve got just one Pokémon?\nAt that count, we can’t fight.
183	There’s no way we’ll lose!\nIt’s important to feel strong!
184	A loss and a loss make a double loss!
185	The tears we cry when we lose make\nus stronger.
186	You’ve got just one Pokémon?\nThen sorry, we can’t battle.
187	If it’s all right with you, battle with us!
188	Oh my gosh!
189	We admire Dexio and Sina, the great\nduo from the Kalos region!
190	You’ve gotta have two Pokémon to battle\nwith us as a duo!
191	Combos that can’t be used alone can be\nused when there are two of us!
192	Combos are so difficult.\nBut that’s why they’re fun!
193	Those mysterious people, Sina and Dexio,\nare solving all sorts of cases!
194	This is a 2-on-2 Pokémon battle!\nYou don’t have enough healthy Pokémon.
195	Battles are the best for raising Pokémon!
196	Even if Pokémon lose...it’s OK as long as the Trainer\ngrows from that.
197	Trainers also grow through raising Pokémon.
198	[~ 198]

201	One of the duties of a Breeder is to discover\nand refine the strengths of Pokémon.
202	I wanna know what my strengths are!
203	The more you learn about Pokémon, the more\nfascinating they become!
204	Alola! I’m Caleb. Let’s give each other a look at\nour Pokémon!
205	Your Pokémon—so cool!
206	I don’t mind Youngster, but I wanna be called\nthat boy in shorts!
207	[~ 207]
208	[~ 208]
209	[~ 209]
210	Here I go!
211	It’s over!
212	Nothing!
213	So!\nWhat do you think of the largeness of my area?!
214	Whoa! A large-scale Trainer!
215	In my case, my volume is large in addition to\nmy area!
216	I was losing constantly, so I’m on a trip\nto find myself.
217	I think about why I lost, but I don’t dwell on it!
218	Even if you dwell on your losses, tomorrow\nis a new day!
219	Attacking from a high place to a low place is as\neasy as chopping down bamboo.
220	I guess I wasn’t able to make full use of\nthe potential energy from being in a high place.
221	The Ability No Guard ensures that all attacks\nwill hit!\r\nYeah, even against Pokémon using Fly!
222	Trainer detected!\nI will now commence the attack!
223	An honorable defeat!\nI lost, but it was invigorating!
224	I had climbed to a high place...\nI was hoping for a way to get down.\c\nSo my thanks to you!
225	Research! Research!\nI shall research the Pokémon!
226	I present the results of my research!\nThis person’s Pokémon—strong!
227	A further research topic is how to defeat\nstrong Pokémon.
228	The sea and beach are so nice.\nJust being here broadens my mind!
229	Me as I am now, I can tolerate losing.
230	Battling for enjoyment without worrying\nabout winning or losing is also nice.
231	Hee hee... Wanna help\nme pass the time?
232	Nuh-uh!
233	Maybe you’re a little too stoked?
234	Good wind! Good waves!\nAbove all, my good mood!
235	Were my Wingull in a bad mood?
236	You can catch the flow if your Pokémon\nuse moves while in a good mood!
237	Can you tell me how you chose your\npartner Pokémon?
238	I have trouble deciding on my partners,\nbecause there are so many criteria.
239	Lapras is so great!\nI feel pleasantly cool when I ride on its back.
240	The best thing about Swimmers?\c\nThere is nothing for us other than Pokémon!\nWe represent freedom.
241	I’m empty-handed, but I do have the prize money\nto pay you.
242	A place to put away Poké Balls?\nThat’s the mystery of Swimmers, isn’t it?
243	I’ll attack you boldly in my bold bikini!
244	Left watered-down at the waterfront!
245	Bikinis and Pokémon battles are\ntotally unrelated.
246	Which Pokémon do you think is fitting with the\ngrave? Let’s battle. Perhaps you’ll figure it out.
247	Is it Ghost type after all?\nI’m also looking for something that’s unexpected.
248	The graves in Akala have been here\na long time...\r\nThat’s why this is a tourist spot.
249	I thought I’d have a little gander at the\nRuins of Life.\r\nBut there’s one thing to do first!
250	Quite skillfully done!
251	Tapu Lele visits the Ruins of Life...\nIt’s considered to be the vitalizing Pokémon.
252	Punk Girl sounds scary, doesn’t it?\c\nPlease be friendly and call me Punky.
253	You’re...the calm, cool, and collected type, aren’t you?
254	With these flashy looks but polite expressions,\nI deceive and confuse my opponents.
255	People in graves are sleeping forever, right?
256	Aah... I’m getting sleepy!
257	If they’re sleeping and won’t wake up, just give\nthem a Chesto Berry to hold.
258	Good morning!\nMornin’ for short!
259	You played that battle well!\nGG for short!
260	Thanks for being my opponent!\nTY for short!
261	I fish when I think I can catch something.\nI battle when I think I can win.
262	Would’ve been nice if I could’ve won just by thinking\nI could win.
263	I fish when I think I can catch something.\nI fish when I believe I can catch something.\r\nThey are similar but different.
264	Work through brute force doesn’t go well!
265	Your power is beyond what I imagined!
266	Doing calculations allows you to tap into\nyour power!
267	Dig a hole!
268	If there was a hole here, I’d wanna crawl into it!\nI wanna dig a hole and hide!
269	Dig a hole! If I dug it, I’d wanna fill it up.\nMy soul cries out at me to do that!
270	Whether in battles or in digging tunnels,\nPokémon are incredible!
271	The same is true for my Pokémon, but your\nPokémon—incredible!
272	This was originally a path dug by Diglett.\c\nDiglett let us use it as well, so we maintain\nit out of gratitude!
273	Eat well, sleep well...then it’s time for a\nproper battle!
274	I’ve had enough!\nI can’t fight anymore.
275	A Trainer’s Pokémon don’t grow if they are\nleft alone.\c\nAlthough when I eat meals, I naturally\ngrow horizontally.
276	Are you raising Pokémon?
277	Maybe, in addition to providing care, raising means\ndrawing out talents?
278	I’ve built up the lower body of my Pokémon\nthrough the undulations on the ranch!\c\nI guess what I need to use most is myself...
279	All right! Trial-goer, have a look at my kids.
280	You’re growing rapidly.\nThat’s wonderful!
281	Trainer and Pokémon are like parent and child!\nJust seeing them cheerful makes you happy!
282	Look at the lustrous heads of my Pokémon!
283	My Pokémon are cute, even when they lose!
284	I can’t help petting the heads of my Pokémon!\c\nIt seems there are even Pokémon that\nwill high-five you if you hold up your hand!
285	I keep repeating fair battles with Pokémon\nand Trainers.\r\nWhat kind of person is a Fisherman...?
286	Joy when I hook it...\nSadness when it gets away...
287	Life bobs up and down...\nI think while watching the bobber...\c\nI could catch rare Pokémon from rock\npiles with bubbles spouting from them...
288	You’re a fool if you dance...\nand a fool if you just look on!
289	My stomach is crying and saying “urgent”!
290	My stomach is crying and saying “urgent”!
291	It’s fine with me.\nI’ve grown tired of eating rich meals.
292	It’s fine with me.\nI’ve grown tired of eating rich meals.
293	Argh, the humiliation...\nWell, eat heartily, at least.
294	Argh, the humiliation...\nWell, eat heartily, at least.
295	That was a filling appetizer.
296	That was a filling appetizer.
297	What a shame! The delicious-looking\nfood will all be nourishment just for you.
298	What a shame! The delicious-looking\nfood will all be nourishment just for you.
299	Me! I’ll go back to being an ordinary Breeder!
300	Me! I’ll go back to being an ordinary Breeder!
301	Argh! First I take a loss, and then I get called by my company!
302	Argh! First I take a loss, and then I get called by my company!
303	All this moving around made me\nunnecessarily hungry!

310	Good-bye, my tasty chow...
311	What’s “sir-vival of the fit-tust”?
312	What’s “sir-vival of the fit-tust”?
313	Wh-what?!\nMy calculations were off!
314	Wh-what?!\nMy calculations were off!
315	Whaaat!
316	Whaaat!
317	Win or lose, it’s the same price...
318	Win or lose, it’s the same price...
319	Bwah!!\nI had my breath held that whole battle!
320	Bwah!!\nI had my breath held that whole battle!
321	Bwah!!\nI had my breath held that whole battle!
322	Hey, yo! When I fight, I’m not supposed to lose!
323	I don’t know if you care, but that bus stop weighs about\nas much as Golem!
324	You’re with Kukui...\nLooks like he brought along a good Trainer.
325	I see.\nGreat work...I guess.
326	You, you!
327	Hmmph! I can’t even stand myself right now!
328	If attacking from the front doesn’t work, what about\nfrom the rear... I’ve got a lot to think about!
329	A lookout has to be strong for when the time comes!
330	You’re on a whole other level than me.\nI’ve just got to laugh at myself...
331	Ack! The island challenge has made you way too strong!
332	Yeah, yeah.\nI gotta admit, that was great!
333	Hmph... How annoying.
334	Hmph...
335	[~ 335]
336	Aiyee!
337	Hmm...It seems as though I may have lost.
338	I haven’t done enough development work on\nPokémon battles!
339	You really do just win, don’t you?\nHonesty seems like the way to go.
340	It’s not a particularly original line, but wherever there\nis light, there is also shadow.
341	There is another world that cannot be brought\nabout through idle talk... Got it?
342	That was—! No way!\nBut I totally had to win this one!
343	That was—! No way!\nBut I totally had to win this one!
344	That was—! No way!\nBut I totally had to win this one!
345	I gotta keep the boss from getting his hands\ndirty, so I’m gonna wreck you myself!
346	Wasn’t me who got crushed! It was my\nPokémon, right? You think so, too, right?
347	The boss is not gonna be happy about this...\c\nI wish he would punish my Pokémon instead\nof me!
348	Aiyee!
349	Here’s an impression for you: Aiyee!
350	Hmph... That’s Faba for you.
351	This is for the sponsor who supports\nTeam Skull!
352	All our strength comes from the money we’ve gotten...
353	I’ll do anything if you pay me for it!\c\nLike, let’s see... Wanna see me get hit with\nHyper Beam?
354	Hey, what’s up with you?\nHow come I can’t smash you?!
355	How...how can you be so awful!
356	Ow, that hurts! Even my heart hurts!
357	Our 200 percent is, like, what\npercentage of your strength?!
358	Thud! That’s the sound of your\nstrength rocking me to my core!
359	Aaauuuggghhhhhhhhh!!!
360	Hmph.\nThere’s nothing more to say.
361	I could feel the power you gained\non your journey through Alola.
362	Really lovely...both you and your Pokémon...
363	I’m...I’m speechless! You’ve done me in!
364	It’s frustrating to me as a member of the Elite Four,\nbut it seems your strength is the real deal.
365	I couldn’t win even though I went all out...\nBut what a refreshing feeling. Woo!

373	Oh my gosh! I lost to a trial-goer!\nAn authentic Alola experience!
374	Oh my gosh! I’ve gotta go see\nKiawe’s fiery dance with Pokémon!
375	If it’s a mountain, I’ve gotta climb it!\nThat’s the spirit of the Hiker!
376	There are some mountains I can’t climb...\nI’m talking about you and your Pokémon!
377	I’ve gotta first climb down the mountain.\nI’m off to be able to climb the next one...
378	Allow me to show you the ace Kadabra of an\nAce Trainer!
379	Aah!\nI blacked out!
380	I want to make my Kadabra evolve! Friends...\nI need friends!
381	Whee-ooh, whee-ooh!\c\nMy impression of a siren is pretty good, eh?\nI’m pretty good at Pokémon battles, too.
382	You’re something else! You’re better\nat Pokémon battles than I am!
383	I want to put a siren on Tauros and\nmake it exclusive to Police Officers.
384	I know so much about rare Pokémon!
385	You see...rare Pokémon are too special to be used\nfor fighting...
386	Shiny Pokémon are too special to be\nshown off...
387	Were you bothered by this Beauty\nstrolling along? Or by my Pokémon?
388	You bother me!
389	Telling someone their Pokémon are cute\nis a good way to strike up a conversation.

399	Even if I did forget to put on my shorts, get\nready for me and my stoked Pokémon!
400	Wait, so I actually am wearing shorts?
401	If I forgot to put on my shorts, I’d be just an\nordinary kid!
402	Pokémon battles are life.\nYou’re bashing our way of life!
403	The joy of victory...the agony of defeat...that’s life.
404	Whether I win or lose, my life will go on.\nI’m not gonna mope around forever.
405	It’s important for Pokémon to be cute\nand strong!
406	It’s possible to lose when you’re cute\nand strong? What’s up with that?
407	We just need to get cuter and stronger!
408	Moves with high accuracy.\nMoves with high power...\r\nHey! Allow me to experiment!
409	You’ve got to be able to read your opponent’s\nthoughts in addition to the statistics of a move!
410	Do you know Professor Kukui?\c\nHe’s building up his body to take the full impact\nof Pokémon moves so he can check their power.

418	Alola...
419	Alola!
420	Hey, hey!\nCome on out here, my Pokémon!
421	All right, everybody...back inside your Poké Balls...
422	Ah, it’s so nice out!
423	Looks like you’ve got a Fishing Rod made\nby Lana!
424	If I only had a Fishing Rod made\nby Lana, I could win, too!
425	Lana put her soul into the Fishing Rod\nshe made.\c\nEr, don’t you think that the rod is Lana herself?
426	[~ 426]

429	The reason I don’t ride Lapras is because\nI can swim faster than Lapras.
430	Does swimming fast have nothing to do with\nwinning or losing?!
431	I can’t compete with the swimming speed of\nSharpedo and Poliwrath!
432	Abs! Abs!
433	My Golduck and I were distracted by our surroundings...
434	If you go on a date at the beach, you can see\nyour girl’s swimsuit...\c\nThat’s what I was thinking, but my girl’s been\ntraining the whole time.
435	You’ve got just one Pokémon? That will\nmake it too tough for you to fight with us.
436	When I get in the ocean, I get pricked by\nCorsola or Pyukumuku!
437	Argh! It’s ’cause Pyukumuku gets stuck\nto my behind.
438	Pokémon stick to me just like Shellder biting\ndown on Slowbro’s tail...
439	You’ve gotta have two Pokémon if you wanna\nbattle us!
440	You’re gonna fully experience my\nWater-based tactics!
441	Bubble, bubble, bubble...\nI sink and I dive...
442	My swim trunks are out of respect\nfor Machamp!
443	Hee-hee, I’m not a mermaid.\nI’m a Pokémon Trainer in a bikini!
444	Oh! Stormy!
445	I just wanna dissolve away right here...just\nlike Vaporeon...
446	[~ 446]

449	I hate serious people, yo.\c\nI am serious about being a\nTeam Skull Grunt, though!
450	Even if you work seriously, you won’t always get results!
451	Hmph! Since you’re serious...lemme give you a\ntip, yo.\c\nYo, yo, ya don’t stop.\nEven if you lose, ya don’t stop!
452	I’m a grand Grunt.\nThe Pokémon Carnivine is my fave.
453	Yep, I lost. I got crushed.
454	I’m a grand Grunt. Carnivine is my fave, but I\ndon’t have one.
455	No one has lost today. What a lovely, good day!
456	Aww, I lost... What a terrible, bad day...
457	Who can I take out the sadness of this loss on?\nAnyway, sadness for me and Team Skull.
458	Hunh? Everything around here seems like a\nTeam Skull paradise.
459	I might really go to paradise now that I’ve lost!
460	Aaah! I wish I had taken the island challenge\nmore seriously!
461	Surrounded by flowers...\nI’m...gorgeous...
462	Ahh! The flower I am has fallen.
463	Flowers and young women...\nour impermanence makes us gorgeous...
464	Do you know about super, strong Pokémon?
465	I said “super,” but I meant\nsomething a little different.
466	The fluffy ones are really the super Pokémon!
467	Today is Pokémon day!
468	I’m fine ’cause I’m with Cleffa.
469	If I’m in a tough spot, Cleffa sends me to\nmy house.
470	All right! Time for a commemorative photo!\nJust need you to lose for me, ’K?
471	What did I say...\nWhat...did I say...
472	I got overexcited by my journey!\nMy bad, my bad. Eheh...
473	When I’m traveling, I just want to\npoint out everything!
474	I disclosed everything...\neverything about my Pokémon!
475	I always get a little down when I get home.\nMaybe I can travel forever?
476	Listen up, Trainer.\nBattle is a Hiker’s favorite.
477	Listen up, Trainer.\nA Hiker hates to lose.
478	Listen up, Trainer.\c\nA Hiker’s most favorite are big and\ntough Pokémon!\r\nAnd next is a big helping of rice!
479	By battling a Collector, you’ll be able to obtain\ninfo on rare Pokémon!
480	You got me! I’ll tell you my treasured info.
481	I’m craning my neck, waiting to see if\nMeteorite Pokémon will fall.\r\nYeah, just like Turtonator!

494	I’m an incomplete Grunt.\nThis is the only place for me in the whole world!
495	This is a fitting outcome for me, incomplete as\nI am—the end!
496	The boss is a complete bully, but I’m an\nincomplete Grunt.\c\nSometimes I want to smash the world,\nbut I’m always afraid of it.
497	I’ll stop you so Guzma will stay chill!
498	This is terrible, yo... The mansion is gonna get\nwrecked again!
499	Guzma... Even though he’s so strong, he wasn’t\nable to become a Captain!
500	An uninvited guest... Do you have an invitation?
501	I guess that attack was your alternative to an invitation!
502	No! I wish I had never come here! Probably\nbecause three passwords are needed instead\r\nof an invitation. And I lost the memos with\r\nthe passwords somewhere in the mansion!
503	So sorry! As a stranger, you get a full course of\nmy Pokémon’s moves!
504	Your full course...it’s got way too much seasoning!
505	I always make sweet pancakes or sweet Berry\ncakes, yo.
506	Hey! So you think peeking in people’s rooms is\nin good taste?!
507	At least your Pokémon have good taste...
508	What does it mean to say “in good taste”?\nIs it like saying it’s cosmopolitan? Is there such\r\na thing as a cosmopolitan Pokémon?
509	Ooh, looking for a battle in a romantic\nspot, hmm?
510	I guess nobody likes Team Skull after all...
511	Even this dreamy balcony is\nsurrounded by the town, so it’s boring.\c\nYo, check it! Surrounded by surroundings,\nit’s so astounding!\c\nIck! Never mind, that was terrible!
512	One, two, hit THREE sandbag.\nFour, five, we’re ra-SIX-cals.
513	After 10 seconds, the bell rings, and it’s a knockout, baby!
514	It’s a pain to go all the way to the Pokémon\nCenter, so I just sleep next to my Pokémon!
515	I’m just as good as the woman next to me!
516	I was just as good as the woman next to me, right?\nRight?
517	We’re twins, so we’re always being compared.\c\nSo I’m sure you get my wanting to be just as\ngood as her.
518	Oh? You don’t have two Pokémon?\nIn that case, we can’t take you on.
519	I stack up to the one next to me!
520	I’m stronger than the one next to me, right?\nRight?
521	We’re twins and she’s the big sister,\nso we’re always compared.\r\nSo I’m sure you get my wanting to win.
522	Oh? You don’t have two Pokémon?\nIn that case, we can’t take you on.

538	I offer up my dancing in appreciation\nfor receiving Berries.
539	I forgot to dance for victory...
540	Long ago, it seems that people related to the\nTapu through dance.
541	Let’s have a quick battle while gathering\nBerries together with our Pokémon!
542	Really, pardon me...
543	Berries keep for a long time.\c\nFor we who travel the seas, they’re the\nperfect ingredient.
544	Rare Trainer discovered!\nI must immediately make contact!
545	Do you have a sense for why you\nseem rare?
546	You weren’t born in Alola.\nFor some reason, that’s what I think.
547	Does this area seem like a power spot\nto you?
548	Aah! My Pokémon didn’t get infused with power!
549	The Pokémon enshrined at the Ruins...\napparently they purify our impurities.
550	Ready, set, go!
551	Game, set!
552	Congratulations!
553	My Pokémon is tough as nails!
554	I’m deflated.\nI’ve lost all heart...
555	Fortunately, Crabominable is upbeat!\nIt will restore my lost heart!
556	I’ve completed Trials and Grand Trials,\nnow I aim for an even higher place!
557	Were the Trials you completed more densely packed\nthan the ones I did?
558	I’m literally searching for a high place!\nI’m actually gonna go climb a tree.
559	I’ve assembled my team members from Pokémon\nthat spring from the mountains.
560	Conflicts produce nothing, but from Pokémon battles springs\na sense of mutual respect.
561	If a Hiker like me springs from the mountains,\nSwimmers could well spring from a wellspring!
562	I was a Rising Star who spent all my time in\nbattle, and now I’m a Veteran!
563	I say I’m a Veteran, but the path of Pokémon runs steep!
564	If you keep cherishing your Pokémon,\nyou can become a Veteran, too!
565	I’m not just an ordinary Sightseer!
566	Whoa! I’ve discovered a cluster of talent\nin the Alola region!
567	I’m a Sightseer battling to get stronger\nin the battle facilities of each region!
568	Surely you are able to battle with two\nPokémon at the same time, aren’t you?
569	We want even stronger rivals!\nMy Pokémon and I both cry out for that!
570	Thank you for showing the strength I was looking for!\nI’m glad I came to Alola!
571	That’s right... Battle Towers—and their like in\ndistant regions—are the facilities I favor!
572	I came all the way to Alola, so I want you to\nshow me two Pokémon!
573	I know a lot about Pokémon...\nI can use my knowledge in battle!
574	You know a lot about Pokémon.\nAmazingly, even more than I do!
575	Completion of the Pokédex is\nthe basis of Pokémon research!\c\nYou should collect a ton of Pokémon\nwith Rotom!
576	What are Pokémon?\nDo you know?
577	Why was I unable to win?\nThank you for giving me an assignment!
578	What are Pokémon?\c\nEveryone will have a different answer, but\nyou can figure it out by thinking about it.
579	I’m a self-seeking Backpacker!\nI savor each day as it comes.\r\nI guess today will be a battle with you!
580	This is the taste of defeat...\nPerhaps it’s delicious to savor!
581	It’s good to be a Backpacker!\c\nYou get to decide on your own all the\nthings you do and don’t want to do!
582	I battle every day.\nThere’s no one who can match me in that!
583	Darn! It’s my fault that my Pokémon lose\nso often.
584	We’re so strong because of marital disputes!\nAhaha!
585	You want to fight us!\nYou’ve gotta have two Pokémon.
586	Ohoho! We battle 50 times a day.
587	The shame from losing will rejuvenate me!
588	You might say that I raised\nmy husband’s Pokémon!
589	You want to fight with us, right?\nThen you’ve gotta have two Pokémon.
590	To be the strongest is an unfulfilled dream...\nbut you must press on to get closer to it!
591	Whoa! Training!\nI haven’t done enough training!
592	Even after the island challenge, I still want\nto strengthen myself!\c\nTrainers and Pokémon who feel that way\ngather at the Battle Tree!
593	To form a battery, my Pokémon and I battle\nconstantly while synchronizing our breathing.
594	Whoa... You’re legit!
595	Talonflame is the pitcher and I’m\nthe catcher!\c\nYou may wonder how it throws, but let’s\nnot talk of it!
596	Let’s have a party.\nA rough-and-tumble Pokémon party!
597	Your attacks were effective!\nI felt them all the way to my heart!
598	The party is over!\nLet’s have a party to celebrate that!
599	I’mma get fired up, naturally!
600	I got fired up and lost, naturally!
601	It’s the fighting spirit, yo, the fighting spirit!\nZ-Power is fighting spirit, too, right?
602	We’re aiming for the top, so be prepared for us\nto go all out!
603	You guys are the tops!\nI felt the strength in your heart!
604	If you’re aiming for the top, you’ve got\nto test yourself against top opponents!\c\nThe world is simple like that!
605	A strong Trainer can tell the strength of\nhis or her opponent at a glance!
606	What amazing Pokémon!\nTruly, I must admit my defeat!
607	I like Pokémon so much, it actually pains me...\nSo I let all of them shine in battle.
608	[~ 608]
609	[~ 609]
610	[~ 610]
611	The way you guys trust each other!\nI want to see it all!
612	Nicely done! I dig it—Pokémon and Trainers who trust\neach other.
613	You can demonstrate your full strength\nby trusting each other!
614	The altar is just a little farther, so I can’t\nlet you pass easily.\r\nShow me everything you’ve got!
615	Whoa, you’ve got a lot...\nI have no choice but to admit defeat!
616	Go where you please!\c\nIf you and your Pokémon give it everything\nyou’ve got, there’s no place you can’t reach!
617	Trainers and Pokémon should be\nfree! Freedom is good!
618	Good stuff!\nBe as free as you can be!
619	We can’t decide what Pokémon are like!\nThey are free!
620	Do trial-goers come all the way out here?\nWhat’s the deal with the kids in Alola?
621	Alola is great!\nYou and your Pokémon are great!
622	Ah! There are still so many undiscovered\nPokémon in the world!\c\nWhen you finish the island challenge,\nyou should travel the world!
623	The most dangerous spot in Alola.\c\nAllow me to test whether you can\nget past the Vast Poni Canyon!
624	Excellent! You guys should be able to reach\nthe altar!
625	The Altar of Alola concentrates the power of\nthe stars...\r\nThat’s what they say.
626	You need two Pokémon that can battle!\nThat’s our request to you.
627	Show me how serious you and your\nPokémon are!
628	Wonderful! You and your Pokémon should absolutely\nhead to the altar!
629	The Altar of Alola is a vessel that\ncollects light...\r\nThat’s what they say.
630	You need two Pokémon that can battle!\nThat’s our request to you.
631	If you climb mountains, there’s so much\nyou need to know about them—the Pokémon\r\nthat live there and the Trainers you’ll meet!
632	I went to the top! And you’re the tops!\nThat’s pretty similar!
633	Totem Pokémon seem to guard the favorite\nplaces of the Tapu—the guardian deities.
634	I like Pokémon!\c\nI like battling!\c\nI like using moves!\c\nAnd I love winning!
635	I lost! But my Pokémon that lost are adorable!
636	I hate losing!\c\nBut falling to the bottom and then struggling\nto climb back up, I can’t get enough of that!
637	I’ll win! That’s all there is to it.
638	I lost! That’s all there was to it...\nWell, you guys are terrific.
639	The hearts of the Pokémon\nand Trainer overlap...\r\nThey seek only victory!\c\nI want to reach that kind of mental state.
640	Anywhere for the sake of research!\nJust like my idol—Professor Birch.
641	The skills of Pokémon are needed\nwhen examining places here and there.
642	If you know Pokémon, you may be able\nto travel here and there without battling.
643	I confined myself to this cave to seek\nthe secrets of battle.\c\nIf it’s all right with you, please\nbattle my beloved Pokémon!
644	Attacking and defending, I guess it’s all\nup to oneself.
645	Adjusting to one’s opponent...\nMaintaining oneself...\c\nBoth are wonderful! What’s important\nis whether something is fitting to oneself.
646	My outward face is that of a Backpacker.\nWhat about my inward face...?
647	You guys are strong, so I could not steal\na glorious victory.
648	I’m a treasure hunter looking for treasure!\c\nHave a whiff of this whole area.\nYou can smell the aroma of treasure!
649	In this case, I’ll ask you!\nWhat do you think a mountain is?
650	What strength!\nJust like a mountain!
651	A mountain is a concept!\nSomething you must overcome is a mountain!
652	Intruder spotted! I’ll fight with all I have to wipe\nyou out!
653	What does this mean? What does this mean!
654	You may think yourselves strong,\nbut Aether Paradise is huge!
655	I’ll crush you to find out what you’re made of!\nI bet it’s a bunch of stuff, including money!
656	Oh! Prize money!
657	There are people with many different faces at\nAether Paradise.
658	I wanna go back in time and tell myself to not battle you.
659	It’s not bad to lose! It’s bad to win against me!
660	I lost, I lost! I’ll give you the money I have!
661	You don’t have to ring the bell.\nIf our eyes meet, I’ll come.
662	Having to hand over my pocket\nmoney rather than getting a tip...
663	Recently, there have been cases of Pokémon\nstaying by themselves...
664	The first step to surpassing Captain\nMallow is to strengthen my Pokémon!
665	I lost!\nLet me have another!
666	Mallow’s food is special.\nIt grips your heart.
667	Alola, alola! Welcome, Trainer!
668	Hula, hula!
669	A lot of people come by holding Eggs,\nso cheer them on with dance!
670	I’m training together with the genius\nnext to me in order to beat him!
671	Master! Sorry...
672	If you’re strong, be just!\nI bow my head to my young partner!
673	If you only have one Pokémon that can fight,\nplease come back later.
674	I was born a karate genius!\nI teach moves to my Pokémon.
675	I keep a smile even when my Pokémon and I lose!\nIt reassures my Pokémon.
676	Hmm... I’ve got to further devote myself\nto my karate!
677	If you only have one Pokémon that\ncan fight, I must ask you to leave.
678	When it comes to golf or Pokémon, it’s all about\nthe performance.
679	What a miss...\nMy performance was absolutely terrible.
680	Just getting the ball in the hole...\nit’s fun because it’s so difficult!
681	The swing is all in the hips!\nI’ll put my hips into it when I take you on!
682	Even if I can triumph over myself in golf, when it\ncomes to triumphing over my opponent in a match...
683	Meowth looks for my golf ball when I lose it!\c\nIt usually steals it, but...
684	I haven’t had any cases, so I’m bored...\nHow about a battle?
685	This is a case!\n...Or not.
686	It’s OK for a Police Officer to be weak\nbecause Alola is peaceful!
687	Clean, clean! The fighting style of Janitors\nis also clean!
688	Spotless!
689	The Pokémon move Recycle allows you to use\nan item you have already used!
690	[~ 690]
691	[~ 691]
692	[~ 692]
693	Just like flexible bamboo, I’ll evade your attacks!
694	I messed up my evasion!\nYou and your Pokémon are way too awesome.
695	Just like flexible bamboo, I also evade work!
696	Are you aware of the awesomeness of being\nbarefoot over the geothermally warmed ground?
697	Barefoot! The soles of my feet are hot!
698	It gets pretty warm if you’re barefoot\nover the geothermally warmed ground!
699	Welcome to the secret beach!\nLet’s have a battle to get acquainted!
700	Good work, good work.\nHere’s my pocket money!
701	My pocket money...never mind how I fetch it.\c\nAnd never mind about items washing ashore\nevery day.
702	C’mere! Let’s do something\ngood with our Pokémon.
703	Hey! The fun ends immediately if you’re too strong.
704	Items wash up on the Secluded Shore...\c\nIt’s more fun to think of them as the\nhandiwork of Pokémon rather than the tide’s.
705	I want rare Pokémon!\nI’ll go anywhere due to my tenacity.
706	You’d be surprised how little I fixate on victory.
707	My nature as a Collector gives me trouble.\c\nI can’t travel to other islands until I’ve\ncompleted the Ula’ula Island Pokédex.
708	I’m doing research on the island challenge.\nI ask for your cooperation!
709	Despite taking damage, I was able to gather data!
710	Trainers on the island challenge are strong!\nMy research is conclusive!
711	Argh! I can’t help but want to\nbattle when a Trainer is present!
712	Argh! No way I’d lose if this were about dancing.
713	Argh! Hee-hee, I can’t stop\ndancing when I watch Oricorio!
714	I was watching the parabolic antenna,\nand I found a Trainer!
715	Wha-wha-wha-what!
716	I wonder if Pokémon can see microwaves\ntransmitted between parabolic antennae.
717	[~ 717]
718	[~ 718]
719	[~ 719]
720	I feel sorry for the Pokémon who have to be\nused by an intruder!
721	Hmph! Although you’re an intruder, you seem to have\na lot of skill!
722	Is it because you guys arrived? Paradise seems\nso showy!
723	I must fight to reassure the Pokémon\nin paradise!
724	That was regrettable... I guess it really is a must\nto have power!
725	What I heard was that we are to be on the\nlookout for people trying to steal Pokémon.
726	I was told to turn away Trainers, whomever they\nmight be!
727	Hey! You’re so strong that there’s\nno way I can turn you away!
728	That Faba... He doesn’t even try to fight\nby himself!
729	I sensed the strength that you possess as Champion.
730	Since you’ve become Champion, both you and\nyour Pokémon have a certain level of polish.
731	I’m...I’m speechless!\nHow did you do it again?!
732	This feeling of frustration that is swelling within me...\nI will use it to propel my growth!
733	It’s hard to be strong enough to admit that you’re\nweak...you know?
734	Battling against strong Trainers’ll make you stronger, too.\nSlowly but surely!
735	Battling against strong Trainers’ll make you stronger, too.\nSlowly but surely!
736	Battling against strong Trainers’ll make you stronger, too.\nSlowly but surely!
737	I am training to properly form my desire for victory.
738	All I have to do is avoid making any more mistakes...\nAfter all, I have Silvally with me.
739	Th-this child has—!
740	If you want to see a rainbow, you’ve got to wait for it to\nstop raining.
741	Yes, yes...
742	You provide a dazzling battle.
743	There’s no need for two suns in the sky.
744	...While there are times when there’s a full moon,\nthere are also times you can’t see the moon at all.
745	Intense battle is a lot for my old body to bear...
746	Summer ice is much sought after, but no one even\nglances at winter ice.
747	I couldn’t skillfully do what I learned from my grandma!
748	The bitterness of defeat...I must fully savor that as well.
749	Yes! It seems that you are once more victorious!
750	Luvdisc!
751	Corsola!
752	Well! You certainly reeled me in.
753	Sure enough, when it comes to you and Pokémon,\nthe quality of the ingredients shines forth!
754	...I can’t beat you if I keep my troubles to myself.
755	[~ 755]
756	[~ 756]
757	[~ 757]
758	[~ 758]
759	You again?\nHow come I can’t crush you?!
760	[~ 760]
761	Congratulations! You cleared a little trial!
762	Congratulations! You cleared a little trial!
763	Z-comparison complete...
764	I’m the kahuna of Route 12...\nbut I guess I didn’t do enough autosuggestion...
765	The waves recede!
766	Blown away by the waterfall!
767	Oh, so it’s like that?
768	The mystery is too deep!
769	Indeed...
770	Hmph. Looks like you got me.
771	[~ 771]
772	[~ 772]
773	I was exercising to aid digestion, but you came at me full-on!
774	Father...that was my best shot!
775	What is the meaning of this?!
776	[~ 776]
777	[~ 777]
778	D-d-ding!
779	I’ll eventually be the strongest, and it’ll be awesome...\nNah.
780	It’s hard to be strong enough to admit that you’re weak...\nyou know?
781	It’s hard to be strong enough to admit that you’re weak...\nyou know?
782	It’s hard to be strong enough to admit that you’re weak...\nyou know?
783	[~ 783]
784	[~ 784]
785	[~ 785]
786	[~ 786]
787	My Pokémon each gave it their best.
788	[~ 788]
789	[~ 789]
790	...!
791	You’re a pretty big deal!\nAmazing that I could lose!
792	I lost! Will I repeat the year?\nWill I have to repeat another year?!
793	W-wow, you’re something else!
794	Golden!
795	Ahh, refreshing!
796	[~ 796]
797	[~ 797]
798	[~ 798]
799	[~ 799]
800	All I have to do is avoid making any more mistakes...\nAfter all, I have Silvally with me.
801	All I have to do is avoid making any more mistakes...\nAfter all, I have Silvally with me.
802	The ridiculous power at the scene of a fire!
803	I lost. I was extinguished!
804	When Poliwhirl is on the ground, its sweat\nmakes it slippery, so when you touch it,\r\nit feels slimy in a good way!
805	I’m confident in the training I’ve done\nwith my Pokémon! Check it out!
806	Ahh! Did I not use enough Pokémon Refresh?\nDid I not use enough?
807	Practice is practice!\nIn the end, you need the will to win.
808	If you really wanna see what we can do,\nyou’ve gotta have two healthy Pokémon!
809	Testing out the results of one’s training\nis of the utmost importance!
810	It’s frustrating to lose in red rover!
811	You’ve got to go all out in training, too! ’Cause\nthe tension is totally different in a real game.
812	If you really wanna see what we can do,\nyou’ve gotta have two healthy Pokémon!
813	[~ 813]
814	[~ 814]
815	[~ 815]
816	Me an’ Stufful aren’t messing around!
817	What?! But it’s so fluffy!
818	Whoever yer against, “not messing\naround” means recognizing yer opponent.
819	Faith moves mountains!
820	My hopes were crushed!
821	Is faith needed to speed up one’s techniques?
822	A weak Trainer blames losses on his or\nher Pokémon!
823	No way! It’s cool with me, bad dude that I am,\nso let’s go again!
824	I’m a Punk Guy! I’d be a punk to give up!
825	Hey! There’s no way you can battle against us\nwith just one Pokémon.
826	The weather in Alola is too nice, so\nyou get why I wanna get rowdy, right?
827	Sooo bad!
828	Don’t call me a Punk Girl.\nThat makes it sound like I’m a bad kid!
829	Hey! We can’t battle you if you’ve got just\none Pokémon.
830	I’m an Office Worker!\nOr you could say I’m a business guy!
831	Hm? Are my partners business Pokémon?
832	I want to do business with Pokémon.\c\nFor example, I could use the pincers of\nCrabrawler, which grow back constantly.
833	Oricorio and others come, lured by\nflower nectar.
834	An Office Worker standing in a meadow.\nThat could be a painting...
835	The flower nectar is so delish that\nit makes Oricorio’s form change.
836	I’d go anywhere to be extreme!\nCheck out how us bad dudes do it.
837	Hmph! Ya may be strong, but there’s nothing good or\nbad about ya!
838	I’ve gotta praise an opponent who has taken\ntheir favorite fighting style to the extreme!
839	I wanna beat you down!\nCome back with two healthy Pokémon.
840	All I can do is get psyched against an opponent\nI can’t beat, even after I’ve trained myself up!
841	I can’t do anything through my psyched ’tude.\nBut I’ve gotta look cool!
842	Even if I know I can’t win, I can’t show my uncool\nside to my battling Pokémon, so I psych\r\nmyself up.
843	I wanna get psyched up!\nJust show me two healthy Pokémon.
844	[~ 844]
845	My stomach is infinite!\nThat’s irrelevant to the strength of my Pokémon!
846	[~ 846]
847	[~ 847]
848	My stomach is infinite!\nThat’s irrelevant to the strength of my Pokémon!
849	[~ 849]
850	[~ 850]
851	I... When I lose, I get disheartened and then I get hungry again.
852	[~ 852]
853	[~ 853]
854	I... When I lose, I get disheartened and then I get hungry again.
855	[~ 855]
856	Whoa! I’m shocked at your strength!
857	It’s extremely frustrating, but you’re stronger than me!
858	The Pokémon and Trainer’s feelings\nare stacked together...\r\nTry receiving the unleashed Z-Power!
859	The highness of caliber to triumph\nwhile reacting to the feelings of your opponent!
860	If Pokémon and Trainer boost each other up,\nthe Z-Power unleashed will grow stronger, too!
861	Also known as the move department store!\c\n...I say that, but Pokémon can only remember\nfour moves at the same time.
862	Skarmory! Sharpedo!
863	Pokémon that can learn many different moves\ncan, by doing so, deceive the opposing Trainer!
864	This is a battle that I’m not gonna lose!
865	This is a battle that I’m not gonna lose!
866	This is a battle that I’m not gonna lose!
867	Can you live on ideals alone?\nCan you get by on just high-sounding talk?
868	You guys are dazzling...horribly sparkling...
869	While competing with Team Skull to\nconserve Pokémon...\r\nsome people become steeped in evil.
870	Adults face many complex circumstances, right?\nChildren shouldn’t meddle in their affairs.
871	The children of Alola who aim to be champion through\nthe island challenge—they are not to be underestimated!
872	You all—you’re a good combination.\nDon’t betray your friends!
873	OK, seriously this time!\nThis is a battle that I am not gonna lose!
874	OK, seriously this time!\nThis is a battle that I am not gonna lose!
875	OK, seriously this time!\nThis is a battle that I am not gonna lose!
876	I’ll crush you, meddler with the Pokémon that\nwere being protected by those serious guys!\r\nThat’s the best entertainment!
877	Ehh... Guess it’s back to honest Pokémon conservation\nactivities for me.
878	People in the Alola region treat Pokémon well,\nbut it’s better to make Pokémon fight!
879	Where there is light, there is shadow! But that’s\nnot it. Light generates shadow!
880	Losing to you...generated dark feelings in me!
881	Truly bad people do bad things sneakily.
882	Let’s see, how do I undo this development?
883	What is this... Too severe!
884	I’ll show you my sister who I’m super close to!
885	Oh! I’ve had it!
886	My Pokémon!\c\nPapa caught her for me when I was born!\nSo she’s always with me!
887	We call Malie Garden Nugget Garden!\c\nBeat us five Trainers and win a fabulous prize!\c\nThink you got what it takes?
888	Whoo! Good stuff!
889	I did my best. I have no regrets!
890	I’m second! Now it’s serious!\n
891	How could I lose?
892	I did my best, so I’ve no regrets!
893	Here’s No. 3! I won’t be easy!
894	Ow! Stomped flat!
895	I did my best. I have no regrets!
896	I’m No. 4! Getting tired?
897	I lost, too!
898	I did my best, so I’ve no regrets!
899	OK! I’m No. 5! I’ll stomp you!
900	Whoa! Too much!
901	I did my best. I have no regrets!
902	Arrgh!\nYou are good!
903	Whoa! I’m shocked at your strength!
904	I guess I’m burned out after all...
905	That’s fighting spirit!
906	Whee! Whee! It’s a battle...a battle!
907	Why! I lost!
908	Hey, Trainer!\c\nWhat’s “throw a ball with the Y Button” mean?\nWhat’s it mean?
909	[~ 909]
910	[~ 910]
911	[~ 911]
912	Preschooler pistons, full power!
913	Preschooler pistons, stop!
914	If the Preschooler pistons stop, Pokémon get\nthem moving for me!
915	Welcome, trial-goer!\c\nThink you can handle the ordeal of defeating\na Beauty?
916	Wow! I bet you can finish any Trial!
917	Rotom Dex! Cool, cool!\c\nJust touch Rotom, and it will teach you\nmany things!
918	This result...what’s up with that?!
919	My swelling feelings...\nthey’ve fallen right to the bottom!
920	The waves of emotion swell...\nI’m so frustrated with losing that I wanna scream!
921	Run, run...run away...\nThis is no rendezvous!
922	I couldn’t get it done...\nDon’t worry about it, my precious Pokémon...
923	Hunh! I can’t even stand myself right now!
924	I’m gonna belt out everything inside of me!\nI’ve gotta encourage my Pokémon to keep rocking!
925	That Kukui...he discovered a great Trainer.
926	I couldn’t win even though I went all out...\nBut what a refreshing feeling. Woo!
927	I couldn’t win even though I went all out...\nBut what a refreshing feeling. Woo!
928	I couldn’t win even though I went all out...\nBut what a refreshing feeling. Woo!
929	Even though I prepared my top moves without consulting with\nProfessor Kukui!
930	The gloom that enfolds us like fog...we can’t seem to shake\nit off.
931	Are we headed to the grave, yo? Will our bones be\nlaid bare, yo?
932	There may be no winning or losing before true full power!
933	There may be no winning or losing before true full power!
934	There may be no winning or losing before true full power!
935	Hmph.\nThere’s nothing more to say.
936	Hmph.\nThere’s nothing more to say.
937	I couldn’t win even though I went all out...\nBut what a refreshing feeling. Woo!
938	I couldn’t win even though I went all out...\nBut what a refreshing feeling. Woo!

73	Normally, it has 80 poisonous tentacles.\nThe longer one has been alive, the fewer\ntentacles it will have.

76	Its body can survive dynamite blasts without\na single scratch, but it hates rain and humidity.

89	The stench it gives off will make your nose\nscrunch up. Still, there are Muk fans who think\nthat’s a good thing.
90	The hardness of its shell surpasses the\nhardness of a diamond. In days gone by,\npeople used the shells to make shields.

103	When the time comes, one of its three heads\nfalls off. Before long, the fallen head grows into\nan Exeggcute.

219	
220	
221	
222	Pursued by Mareanie for the branches on its\nhead, this Pokémon will sometimes snap its own\nbranches off as a diversion while it escapes.
223

226	
227	Its metal body is sturdy, but it does rust rather\neasily. So on rainy days, this Pokémon prefers\nto stay put in its nest.
228	
229	
230	
231	
232	
233	Porygon was updated to a new version in\nreadiness for planetary development. But that\ndream remains unrealized as yet.

318	If they scent the faintest trace of blood, they\nrush to attack en masse. When alone, they’re\nrather cowardly.
319	It has a sad history. In the past, its dorsal fin\nwas a treasured foodstuff, so this Pokémon\nbecame a victim of overfishing.

359	Although it’s said to bring disaster, in actuality,\nthis Pokémon possesses a calm disposition and\nwarns people of any crises that loom.
360	
361	It can only survive in cold areas. It bounces\nhappily around, even in environments as cold as\n-150 degrees Fahrenheit.

370	Loving couples have a soft spot for this\nPokémon, so honeymoon hotels often release\nthis Pokémon into their pools.
371	With its steel-hard stone head, it headbutts\nindiscriminately. This is because of the stress\nit feels at being unable to fly.
372	They lurk deep within caves—motionless,\nneither eating nor drinking. Why they don’t die is\nnot known.
373	It flies around on its wings, which have grown in\nat last. In its happiness, it gushes hot flames,\nburning up the fields it passes over.

442	
443	It skulks in caves, and when prey or an enemy\npasses by, it leaps out and chomps them. The\nforce of its attack sometimes chips its teeth.
444	Shiny objects are its passion. It can be found in\nits cave, scarcely moving, its gaze fixed on the\njewels it’s amassed or Carbink it has caught.
445	The protuberances on its head serve as\nsensors. It can even detect distant prey.
446	When it finds something that looks like it might\nbe edible, it goes right ahead and swallows it\nwhole. That’s why it gets fatter day by day.
