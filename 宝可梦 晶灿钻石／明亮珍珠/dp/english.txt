DP_contest_491	What a successful Super Contest Show!\nYou got some hall points!
DP_contest_492	Sorry! This Super Contest Show was a failure.
DP_contest_493	It’s time to announce the Stars of the Show!
DP_contest_652	How would you like to participate?
DP_contest_653	Alone
DP_contest_654	With my group!
DP_contest_497	The Stars of the Show are...
DP_contest_498	Hi! This is the registration counter for\npractice sessions.\c\nHere you can take Super Contest Show lessons.\nWould you like to practice?
DP_contest_499	In a Super Contest Show, four performers work\ntogether, acting in front of a large audience and\r\ndoing their best to put on a successful show!\c\nWhile performing, they’ll be evaluated in three\ncategories: Visual, Dance, and Moves.\c\nWe offer lessons to anyone who wants to enter a\nSuper Contest Show!
DP_contest_500	The Visual Evaluation will be based on the\nPokémon’s conditions and the spectacle of\r\nits customized Ball Capsule.\c\nThere are five types of conditions: Coolness,\nBeauty, Cuteness, Cleverness, and Toughness.\c\nYou can raise each of these by giving your\nPokémon Poffins!\c\nCustomize your Capsule Decoration by placing\nStickers onto Ball Capsules. You can access them\r\nthrough the X menu or by using a PC.\c\nDifferent Stickers pair well with different contest\nshows, so try out a variety of them!
DP_contest_501	The Dance Evaluation is based on your\nrhythm skills!\c\nPush the button with the right timing as notes\nmove along with the music.\c\nScores for each note are divided into categories:\nToo Fast/Slow, Nice, Great, and Brilliant!\c\nThe better your timing, the more your Heart\nGauge will fill, and when it fills up completely,\r\nyou’ll get a [VAR FF00(0001)]♥[VAR FF00(0000)]!\c\nA performance that earns a lot of [VAR FF00(0001)]♥[VAR FF00(0000)]s is definitely\na brilliant one! And that’ll be sure to send your\r\nDance Evaluation score sky high, too!\c\nCollecting [VAR FF00(0001)]♥[VAR FF00(0000)]s will also raise the Hype Meter\nshared by all four performers, pumping up the\r\naudience into a frenzy!\c\nPut on successful shows to earn hall points,\nand you can gradually upgrade the stage into\r\nsomething truly magnificent!
DP_contest_502	The Dance Evaluation is based on your\nrhythm skills!\c\nPush the button with the right timing as notes\nmove along with the music.\c\nScores for each note are divided into categories:\nToo Fast/Slow, Nice, Great, and Shining!\c\nThe better your timing, the more your Heart\nGauge will fill, and when it fills up completely,\r\nyou’ll get a [VAR FF00(0001)]♥[VAR FF00(0000)]!\c\nA performance that earns a lot of [VAR FF00(0001)]♥[VAR FF00(0000)]s is definitely\na shining one! And that’ll be sure to send your\r\nDance Evaluation score sky high, too!\c\nCollecting [VAR FF00(0001)]♥[VAR FF00(0000)]s will also raise the Hype Meter\nshared by all four performers, pumping up the\r\naudience into a frenzy!\c\nPut on successful shows to earn hall points,\nand you can gradually upgrade the stage into\r\nsomething truly magnificent!
DP_contest_503	The Move Evaluation is based on a Pokémon’s\nContest Move, which the Pokémon can only use\r\nonce during the performance!\c\nContest Moves can have a variety of effects\nthat will help with the Dance Evaluation.\c\nChoose the move you’d like in advance at the\nreception desk, then use your Contest Move\r\nwhen you feel like the moment is right!\c\nBased on the success of your move, you may\nreceive [VAR FF00(0001)]♥[VAR FF00(0000)]s from the audience!\c\nAlso, if you coordinate with other performers and\nuse Contest Moves in succession, you can create\r\na Move Chain! Pull it off, and you’ll get more\r\n[VAR FF00(0001)]♥[VAR FF00(0000)]s than if you’d just used a move on your own.\c\nIf you create a Move Chain with moves that have\nthe same type, you’ll get even more [VAR FF00(0001)]♥[VAR FF00(0000)]s.\c\nThe key to success is figuring out the perfect\ntime to use your Contest Move!
DP_contest_504	Please choose a Pokémon to enter, as well as its\nContest Move.
DP_contest_505	Would you like to cancel your practice session?
DP_contest_506	Please choose a Ball Capsule to use in\nthe Contest Show.

DP_contest_686	Hm?\c\nIt appears you don’t have any Pokémon with you\nthat are able to enter that contest show.\c\nPlease come back with a Pokémon wearing the\nContest Star Ribbon.
DP_contest_615	Which would you like to participate in?
DP_contest_616	Allow me to explain the rules of the Super\nContest Show!
DP_contest_617	The Super Contest Show begins with the\nVisual Evaluation.
DP_contest_618	It’s an evaluation of your Pokémon’s conditions,
DP_contest_619	and the spectacle of its customized Ball Capsule!
DP_contest_620	Next, the Dance Evaluation will begin.
DP_contest_621	Here, your Pokémon’s rhythm will be evaluated!
DP_contest_622	Notes will flow across the screen from the right.
DP_contest_623	Press the A Button just as they overlap with the\nscoring area!
DP_contest_624	Notes stretched out into a line are called\nlong notes.
DP_contest_625	Hold the A Button down for as long as the line\nstretches on.
DP_contest_626	If your timing is good as you hit the notes, your\nHeart Gauge will fill up.
DP_contest_627	Each time the gauge fills up completely, you’ll\nreceive one Hype Point ([VAR FF00(0001)]♥[VAR FF00(0000)]).
DP_contest_628	Just once during the Dance Evaluation,
DP_contest_629	you can press the X Button to use a\nContest Move.
DP_contest_630	Contest Moves can give you Hype Points ([VAR FF00(0001)]♥[VAR FF00(0000)]),
DP_contest_631	and if you use yours consecutively with\nother performers,
DP_contest_632	you can pull off a Move Chain and receive even\nmore Hype Points!
DP_contest_633	If the total of all four contestants’ Hype Points\n([VAR FF00(0001)]♥[VAR FF00(0000)]) reaches a certain quota,
DP_contest_634	the Super Contest Show will be a success!
DP_contest_635	Successful shows will earn you hall points,\nand as you collect more of those,
DP_contest_636	the Hall Rank will go up, and the stage will\ngrow fancier!
DP_contest_637	That’s all for the explanation. Would you like\nto try some practice?
DP_contest_638	Hm?\c\nIt appears that you can’t enter a contest show\nwith that rank.\c\nPlease come back after you’ve successfully\ncompleted a contest show at one rank below.

9-msg_r201_shopwoman_01_2	Did you know that a Pokémon’s health is\nmeasured by Hit Points—HP for short?\c\nIf a Pokémon runs out of HP, it faints and can’t\nbattle anymore.\c\nIf a Pokémon’s HP gets low, you should heal it\nwith a Potion.
9-msg_r201_shopwoman_01_3	Here, let me give you some Potions as a sample.\nThese ones are free!\c\nThey will automatically go in your Bag’s\nMedicine pocket.
9-msg_r201_shopwoman_02	You can find a Poké Mart in cities and most\nmajor towns.

10-msg_r202_heroine_01_1	[VAR 0100(0001)]?!\c\nDid you tell your family that you’re helping\nthe professor?\c\n...You didn’t, did you?
10-msg_r202_heroine_01_2	I know that you’re really eager to see all kinds of\nPokémon, but you shouldn’t make your mom\r\nworry that you’ve disappeared.
10-msg_r202_heroine_04	You should go tell your family that you’re helping\nthe professor. The faster the better, too.
10-msg_r202_heroine_05_1	Oh, that’s right!\c\n[VAR 0100(0001)], I haven’t shown you how to\ncatch a Pokémon.
10-msg_r202_heroine_05_2	I’ll demonstrate how to catch one, so just watch\nme, OK?
10-msg_r202_heroine_02_1	*giggle*\nSee? Isn’t it neat?\c\nActually, it’s better to lower your target’s HP\nmore than I did.
10-msg_r202_heroine_02_2	It’s important to get the Pokémon’s HP down as\nlow as possible.\c\nA healthy Pokémon is very difficult to catch.
10-msg_r202_heroine_02_3	Oh, Pokémon also get easier to catch if you\nmake them sleep or something by using a\r\nPokémon’s move.
10-msg_r202_heroine_02_4	OK, [VAR 0100(0000)], to get you started, I’ll\ngive you some Poké Balls!
10-msg_r202_heroine_03_1	If you have lots of Pokémon with you, it’ll be\nsafer on long trips.\c\nPlus, it’ll be a lot more fun having your\nPokémon friends along.

10-msg_r202_hero_04	Why don’t you go tell your family that the\nprofessor asked for your help?\c\nYou should do it right away.
10-msg_r202_hero_05_1	[VAR 0100(0001)], do you know how to\ncatch a Pokémon?
10-msg_r202_hero_05_2	I’ll demonstrate how to catch one, so just\nwatch, OK?
10-msg_r202_hero_02_1	And that’s how it’s done.\c\nActually, I should have lowered the target’s HP\nsome more.
10-msg_r202_hero_02_2	Yup, the important thing is to lower the\nPokémon’s HP as much as possible.\c\nSee, a healthy Pokémon isn’t easy to catch.
10-msg_r202_hero_02_3	Oh, yeah. They also get easier to catch if you\nmake one of your Pokémon put them to sleep\r\nor such.
10-msg_r202_hero_02_4	Here, [VAR 0100(0000)], I’ll give you some\nPoké Balls to get you started.
10-msg_r202_hero_03_1	If you have lots of Pokémon with you, you’ll be\nable to travel farther.
10-msg_r202_hero_03_2	That way, you’ll have a better shot at meeting\nmore Pokémon.\c\nSee you around!

27-msg_c01_sunglasses_02_1	Hello! Let me ask you, have you paid a visit to\nthe TV station?\c\nIf you’ve never been, you owe it to yourself to\nmake the trip.
27-msg_c01_sunglasses_02_2	And, if you’ve been there before, it never hurts\nto visit again.\c\nAfter all, you can be a star!\nOr at least dream of being one!
27-msg_c01_assistantm_02	By the way, have you visited the\nTrainers’ School?\c\nNot yet, right? You really must visit there!
27-msg_c01_assistantm_04	By the way, have you participated in the\nPokétch campaign?\c\nNot yet, right? You really must try!
27-msg_c01_assistantm_05	Hey, you! Yes, you with that cool scarf!\c\nYou should have seen the boy who came running\nby earlier. He ran past me so quickly that I\r\ncouldn’t even manage a hello.

27-msg_c01_pokecth_02_2	All you have to do is find three clowns in\nJubilife City. If you can find them...\c\nI’ll give you your very own Pokétch!
27-msg_c01_pokecth_03_1	The three clowns will each ask you a\nsimple question.
27-msg_c01_pokecth_03_2	The questions will all have to do with Pokémon—\nAfter all, a Pokétch is a tool designed for\r\ndevoted Pokémon Trainers!\c\nCollect a Coupon from each clown,\nthen come see me, OK?

27-msg_c01_crown1_02	Ding-ding!\nYou’re absolutely correct!
27-msg_c01_crown1_03	Bzzzzt!\nThat’s the wrong answer...
27-msg_c01_crown1_04	Pokémon grow stronger by defeating other\nPokémon in battle.\c\nSome Pokémon even change into a different\nPokémon through a process known as Evolution.
27-msg_c01_crown1_05	Here you go! Your Pokétch Coupon!

27-msg_c01_crown2_02	Ding-ding!\nYou’re absolutely correct!
27-msg_c01_crown2_03	Bzzzzt!\nThat’s the wrong answer...
27-msg_c01_crown2_04	If a Pokémon’s type matches the type of a move\nit uses, that move is made much more powerful!
27-msg_c01_crown2_05	Here you go! Your Pokétch Coupon!
27-msg_c01_crown2_06	If a Pokémon’s type matches the type of a move\nit uses, that move is made much more powerful!

27-msg_c01_crown_02	Ding-ding!\nYou’re absolutely correct!
27-msg_c01_crown_03	Bzzzzt!\nThat’s the wrong answer...
27-msg_c01_crown_04_1	A Pokémon may hold a single item.
27-msg_c01_crown_04_2	Some items become effective as soon as they are\nheld by a Pokémon.\c\nBerries are eaten by Pokémon as necessary\nduring battle.
27-msg_c01_crown_05	Here you go! Your Pokétch Coupon!
27-msg_c01_crown_06	Hi there. You should stick around.\nWe’re doing a Pokétch campaign soon.\c\nBefore it starts, I think you should brush up\nat the Trainers’ School.
27-msg_c01_crown_07_1	A Pokémon may hold a single item.
27-msg_c01_crown_07_2	Some items become effective as soon as they are\nheld by a Pokémon.\c\nBerries are eaten by Pokémon as necessary\nduring battle.
27-msg_c01_doctor_01	Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nImpeccable timing, as always.\c\nThese miscreants are babbling utter nonsense\nthat I just can’t stomach.\c\nShow them some manners, if you will.
27-msg_c01_gingam_01_1	Oh, Professor, must you be so difficult?\nWe are approaching you strictly as businessmen.
27-msg_c01_gingam_01_2	All you must do is provide us with all your\nresearch findings.\c\nIn return, we’ll see to it that your assistant\ndoesn’t become collateral damage.
27-msg_c01_heroine_05	[VAR 0100(0001)], let’s battle together and\nteach these losers a lesson!
27-msg_c01_hero_05	[VAR 0100(0001)], let’s battle together and\nteach these losers a lesson!
27-msg_c01_gingam_02	You leave us no option. We will retreat for now.\c\nBecause Team Galactic is benevolent to all,\nwe shall leave.
27-msg_c01_doctor_02_1	So...\nThey call themselves Team Galactic, do they?\c\nWhen Pokémon evolve, they seem to release\nsome sort of energy.
27-msg_c01_doctor_02_2	I believe it’s a mystic power far beyond our\ncontrol. But Team Galactic seems to be trying\r\nto harness that power for something...
27-msg_c01_doctor_02_3	Anyway, [VAR 0100(0000)], well done!\nYou battle quite capably.
27-msg_c01_doctor_02_4	Seeing you Trainers battle side by side with\nyour Pokémon only makes me more confident\r\nin my decision to entrust you with a Pokédex!
27-msg_c01_heroine_06_1	[VAR 0100(0001)], did you know?\c\nThe professor studies the Evolution of\nPokémon, too.
27-msg_c01_heroine_06_2	According to his research, 90% of all Pokémon\nare somehow tied to Evolution!\c\nI guess that means some Pokémon must undergo\nstartling Evolutions.
27-msg_c01_heroine_06_3	So, [VAR 0100(0001)], let’s keep working on our\nPokédex project for the professor!
27-msg_c01_hero_06_1	[VAR 0100(0001)], did you know that the\nprofessor studies the Evolution of Pokémon, too?
27-msg_c01_hero_06_2	According to his research, 90% of all Pokémon\nare somehow tied to Evolution!\c\nI guess that means some unexpected Pokémon\nmust undergo Evolution, too...
27-msg_c01_hero_06_3	So, [VAR 0100(0001)], let’s keep working on our\nPokédex project for the professor!
27-msg_c01_accesse_01_1	Oh, that was very good! Nicely done!\nTruly excellent!
27-msg_c01_accesse_01_2	Oh, I beg your pardon! I’m from Jubilife TV.\c\nI’d like you to have something for letting me see\nthat smashing battle!

27-msg_c01_boy1_02	Fire-type Pokémon?\nYou must have a fiery personality.
27-msg_c01_boy1_03	A person who likes Water-type Pokémon must\nbe pretty cool.
27-msg_c01_boy1_04	You chose Grass-type Pokémon?\nNo wonder you look so calm.
27-msg_c01_babygirl1_01	Did you see me on TV? I was in an interview!
27-msg_c01_woman3_01	When you walk with your Pokémon,\nthey gradually grow friendlier.

27-msg_c01_man3a_01_1	Hiya, where’d you come from?\c\n...
27-msg_c01_man3a_01_2	Twinleaf Town, huh...\nIt’s a nice place—quiet and all.\c\nJubilife City is a big place, so it might be a bit of\na shock to you.
27-msg_c01_oldman1a_01	Hello, Trainer!\nDo you know much about Pokémon?
27-msg_c01_oldman1a_02	Ah, I see! You’re quite well versed indeed!\c\nI imagine you wouldn’t see the need to visit the\nTrainers’ School, then.\c\nBut do visit if you have the time. You may\ndiscover something new!
27-msg_c01_oldman1a_03	Oh, so you’re not very familiar with Pokémon...\nWell, don’t worry!\c\nYou can go visit the Trainers’ School, where\nyou’ll learn all about the basics of Pokémon.

43-msg_c01r0301_girl1_01_2	Talk to people! Talk to everyone you see!\c\nGo places! Go wherever you can!\c\nYou’ll find many new places by doing just that.

47-msg_c01r0501_woman2_02_3	I sound like I’m a teacher or something.
48-msg_c01r0502_boy3_01_1	I like making my Pokémon use their attacks.\c\nSometimes, when Pokémon get stronger, they\nlearn new moves.
48-msg_c01r0502_boy3_01_2	Those new moves keep things fresh and are a fun\ndistraction for me!
48-msg_c01r0502_man1_01_1	Did you buy some Heal Balls at the Poké Mart?\c\nA Heal Ball completely heals the Pokémon it\ncatches on the spot.

54-msg_c01r0701_rival_04_2	There’s a Gym, so it’d be perfect for raising the\nPokémon I just caught.
54-msg_c01r0701_rival_04_3	Well, I’m on the road to becoming the greatest\nTrainer of all time!\c\nSee you around!
54-msg_c01r0701_woman3_01	You just became a Trainer, did you?\c\nYou should look up topics that you’re not\nfamiliar with.

54-msg_c01r0701_boy2a_01	I wrote an essay in my notebook on what makes\na true Pokémon Trainer.
54-msg_c01r0701_board_01	The blackboard lists status changes that may\naffect Pokémon in battle.
54-msg_c01r0701_board_02	Which status would you like to read about?
54-msg_c01r0701_board_03	If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will steadily lose HP.\nThe effects of poison remain after a battle.\c\nHeal a poisoning using an Antidote.
54-msg_c01r0701_board_04	Paralysis reduces Speed and may prevent\nPokémon from using any moves.\c\nParalysis also lingers after battle, so use a\nParalyze Heal to clear up its nasty effects.
54-msg_c01r0701_board_05	If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be unable to\nattack till it wakes.\c\nThe Pokémon may wake up on its own, but if\nthe battle ends first, then it will stay asleep.\c\nYou can wake it up using an Awakening.
54-msg_c01r0701_board_06	Burns lower a Pokémon’s Attack and steadily\nreduce its HP. They linger even after battle.\c\nYou can cure burns using a Burn Heal.

54-msg_c01r0701_notebook_01_2	Pokémon are to be caught using Poké Balls.\c\nUp to six Pokémon can accompany a Trainer.
54-msg_c01r0701_notebook_01_3	A Trainer is someone who catches Pokémon,\nraises them, and battles with them.

55-msg_c01r0801_boy2_01_1	I got my Pikachu by trading from a distant land.
55-msg_c01r0801_boy2_01_2	He grows quickly and his level’s high, but he\ndoesn’t listen to me.\c\nIt’s not always easy, but Pikachu is still my\nirreplaceable partner!

55-msg_c01r0801_middleman2_01	If everyone around the world had Pokémon...\c\nthen everyone around the world\ncould communicate!

59-msg_d14r0101_mount_02_1	Each of these TMs contains the move\nRock Smash.\c\nFYI, when you use a Technical Machine to teach\nyour Pokémon a move, that TM will then break.\r\nSo think very carefully about when to use it.\c\nI’ve also added a new feature to your Pokétch,\nrookie Trainer!
59-msg_d14r0101_mount_02_2	But to use this hidden move in the field, you’ll\nfirst need the Gym Badge from Oreburgh City.\c\nI’m looking forward to seeing your growth!
59-msg_d14r0101_mount_03	Oh! Good golly!\nThat’s Oreburgh City’s Gym Badge!\c\nAll right! Now you can use the hidden move\nRock Smash on small boulders!

17-msg_c04gym0102_leader_06	Yup! If there’s one thing I can tell about you,\nit’s this—you and your Pokémon are gonna get\r\neven tougher, and I mean seriously!
17-msg_c04gym0102_mini09_01	How did you know where to find me?\nLet’s have our battle!
17-msg_c04gym0102_mini09_02	OK, the next Trainer is at the end, past the two\nboulders... I think.
17-msg_c04gym0102_aroma04_01	My Grass-type Pokémon can dole out some\nserious special attacks.\c\nI won’t let you win easily!
17-msg_c04gym0102_aroma04_02	Oh, that’s right... A hint about the next Trainer...\c\nIn the middle of three trees. That’s it for my hint.\nGood luck!
17-msg_c04gym0102_aroma05_01	Even when you try to conceal it, you can’t hide\nthe aroma of flowers.
17-msg_c04gym0102_aroma05_02	Your next opponent is beside four flowers.
17-msg_c04gym0102_sister07_01	*giggle*\nYou found me! Of course I’ll battle you!
17-msg_c04gym0102_sister07_02	*giggle*\nThere’s only our Gym Leader left. Go on—\r\ndon’t be afraid!
18-msg_c04r0801_underground_01_1	I am the first one to have started digging out the\nGrand Underground.\c\nI am! You can call me the Underground Man.\nEveryone else does.
18-msg_c04r0801_underground_01_2	I’ll make a gift of this to you. You hold up your\nend of the deal and put it to good use!
18-msg_c04r0801_underground_02_1	My gift to you, the Explorer Kit, will instantly\ntake you to the Grand Underground!\c\nYou need only to use it, and you will be down in\nthe tunnels and caverns beneath our feet.\c\nUnderground lies a different world where you can\ndo this, that, and the other thing, too!
18-msg_c04r0801_underground_02_2	Let me mentor you as you become a full-fledged\nspelunker. Just follow my lead!
18-msg_ug_mission_01_05	Your road to being a spelunker has barely begun.\nIf you want to know more, just come visit me.

143-msg_r212br0101_woman2_09	So you want [VAR 0109(0000)] [VAR 0107(0002)], right?\nHow many do you want?
18-msg_ug_mission_01_01_1	First, go to the Grand Underground!
18-msg_ug_mission_01_01_2	Going underground is quite easy. Simply use\nyour Explorer Kit.
18-msg_ug_mission_01_02	It can’t be used indoors or in a cave.\c\nNow, give it a try!
18-msg_ug_mission_01_03	Aha! I see that you’ve gone underground.\nWell done! Take these as a reward!
18-msg_ug_mission_01_04	There are apparently some Pokémon in the\nGrand Underground that you can’t normally\r\nfind around here.\c\nMeeting a new Pokémon is 100 times more fun\nwhen it’s a rare one!
18-msg_ug_mission_02_01_1	How was it down in the Grand Underground?\nBig and empty, I would think.\c\nBut that’s just because you’re a novice spelunker!
18-msg_ug_mission_02_01_2	There are many hidden things down there that\nare invisible to the naked eye.\c\nFor my next test, I want you to dig up some\ntreasures for me.
18-msg_ug_mission_02_01_3	While underground, check the radar for any\nspots of yellow light.\c\nGo to such a location and search for treasure\nby pressing the A Button.
18-msg_ug_mission_02_02_1	You’ve not located any treasure yet?\c\nListen. Check the radar and go to any yellow\nspot of light you see. Next, press the A Button\r\nto identify places to dig.
18-msg_ug_mission_02_02_2	Try to get right atop the spot where a yellow\nlight is shown on your radar, OK?\c\nNow, off you go on your treasure hunt!
18-msg_ug_mission_02_03	Ah! I see you were able to use your radar\neffectively! Well done, indeed!\c\nHere’s your reward!
18-msg_ug_mission_02_04_1	Dig in the walls of the Grand Underground to\nunearth hidden things.\c\nTreasure you find will go straight into your Bag!
18-msg_ug_mission_02_04_2	Spheres are special gems that can be exchanged\nfor goods down there.\c\nNow, what should I assign you next...?
18-msg_ug_mission_04_01_1	Have you grown weary of repeatedly going back\nunderground? Well, it’s not over yet!\c\nNext up is your Secret Base. That’s right, I will\nteach you how to make your own Secret Base!
18-msg_ug_mission_04_01_2	All you need is the Digger Drill I gave you earlier.\c\nSimply go to the Grand Underground and use\nthe Digger Drill wherever you like.\c\nIt will instantly create your very own Secret Base!
18-msg_ug_mission_04_01_3	So, your next assignment is: make a Secret Base!
18-msg_ug_mission_04_02_1	Oh? You don’t know how to use the Digger Drill?\c\nOK, I’ll admit this test may have been a little\ntricky for you.
18-msg_ug_mission_04_02_2	All you must do is find the Digger Drill in your\nBag. Then, face a wall and use the Digger Drill.\r\nThat’s all it takes.
18-msg_ug_mission_04_02_3	Do that and you’ll have your Secret Base before\nyou can say...\c\n<size=250%>Boo!</size>\c\nNo, but seriously, there are some walls you can’t\ndig through, like those at the corners of a tunnel.\c\nFirst, try to dig into different walls!
18-msg_ug_mission_04_03	Ah, you’ve made your Secret Base. Excellent!\c\nI thought I might have been asking too much of\nyou, but you did it!\c\nWell done! Take these as your reward!
18-msg_ug_mission_04_04	By the by, a Digger Drill can only be used once.\c\nIf you wish to move your Secret Base, you will\nneed to obtain another Digger Drill.\c\nYou can trade spheres for one underground.\c\nNow, what should I have you do next...?
18-msg_ug_mission_05_01_1	You’ve made yourself a Secret Base, yes...\nBut it’s totally empty, is it not?
18-msg_ug_mission_05_01_2	Not to worry. You can place statues in your own\nSecret Base as you see fit!
18-msg_ug_mission_05_01_3	So! For my next test, I want you to decorate your\nSecret Base. Set up statues in there as you like!
18-msg_ug_mission_05_02_1	Ah, have I finally managed to stump you?\nPerhaps you don’t have any statues?
18-msg_ug_mission_05_02_2	Statues can be found in the stone boxes you’ll\nfind while digging for Fossils!\c\nJust check your radar for yellow lights, press the\nA Button in the right spot, and dig up treasures!
18-msg_ug_mission_05_03_1	Aha! You managed to decorate your Secret Base.\nI knew I recognized a top-notch spelunker in you!\c\nWell done! This is your reward!
18-msg_ug_mission_06_01_1	I’ve taught you all that I know. But if you insist,\nthere is one more thing I should tell you.
18-msg_ug_mission_06_01_2	Have you seen lights with different colors at\nthe spots where you can dig for treasure?\c\nAt these spots, you can dig into the walls more\nthan you could near the usual yellow lights...
18-msg_ug_mission_06_01_3	It seems you can find differently-colored lights\nwhen you communicate with other spelunkers.\c\nIf you do find one, I’ll give you a rare pedestal.
18-msg_ug_mission_06_02_1	Oh, have you found a light of a different color?\c\nIt seems you can find differently-colored lights\nwhen you communicate with other spelunkers.
18-msg_ug_mission_06_02_2	You’re a natural-born spelunker, so I’m pretty\nsure that you’ll be able to find one!
18-msg_ug_mission_06_04_1	Wait, don’t tell me! You’ve found a light of a\ndifferent color?\c\nExcellent! Now you should be capable of digging\nfor more treasures than ever before.
18-msg_ug_mission_06_04_2	Well done! This is your reward!
18-msg_ug_mission_06_05	There really is nothing else that I can teach you.\c\nAdd more statues to your Secret Base, dig for\ntreasure, and become a master spelunker for me!
18-msg_ug_mission_07_01	So, young spelunker, are you going underground\nwith your friends?\c\nThe Grand Underground is vast. It can be a place\nwhere you meet many others like you.
18-msg_ug_mission_07_06	Oh? Your Bag appears to be full.\nDiscard an item or two, then come see me again.
18-msg_ug_mission_07_07	Hm! This belongs to you!
18-msg_ug_mission_08_01_1	Ah! You’ve stuck it out to the end! This will be\nmy final test.\c\nThe Grand Underground attracts lots of people.\nYou’re not the only one down there!
18-msg_ug_mission_08_01_2	Other spelunkers have Secret Bases of their own.
18-msg_ug_mission_08_01_3	Your final test is to find someone else’s Secret\nBase. When you do, make sure to look inside!
18-msg_ug_mission_08_02_1	Ah! Have you found someone else’s Secret Base?
18-msg_ug_mission_08_02_2	First, launch wireless communications, and then\ngo to the Grand Underground!\c\nOnce you find someone’s else’s Secret Base,\nmake sure to take a look inside!
18-msg_ug_mission_08_03_1	Oh! The look on your face tells me you found\nsomeone else’s Secret Base!\c\nWell done. Here’s your reward!
18-msg_ug_mission_08_03_2	Statues set up in Secret Bases appear to impart\nmysterious effects.\c\nYou can even get the power from someone else’s\nSecret Base!\c\nDon’t be shy! Make the power of statues yours!
18-msg_c04r0801_boy2_01	The Grand Underground sure is massive!\nYou’re gonna have a blast down there!
18-msg_c04r0801_assistantm_01_1	Let’s dig up some treasure!\c\nI’m from Oreburgh. I work at the Mining Museum.\c\nI got advice from the Underground Man on\ndigging up Fossils and spheres.
18-msg_c04r0801_assistantm_01_2	Before I get digging, let me share his advice\nwith you—while you’re digging, you may uncover\r\ndark rocks.
18-msg_c04r0801_assistantm_01_3	They are very hard! If you keep hitting them, the\nwall will collapse.\c\nKeep that in mind, and you’ll be digging up\ntreasure in no time!
18-msg_c04r0801_assistantm_02_1	Oh, you’d like more advice on digging up\ntreasure and spheres?\c\nWell, your Explorer Kit contains a sledgehammer\nand a pickax. Choose either of these tools and\r\nuse them to dig into walls.
18-msg_c04r0801_assistantm_02_2	You get to keep the stuff you fully uncover\nbefore the wall collapses.
18-msg_c04r0801_assistantm_02_3	Don’t forget, the dark rocks are impossible\nto break. If you hit them too often, the wall\r\nwill collapse.\c\nKeep that in mind, and you’ll be digging up\ntreasure in no time!
18-msg_c04r0801_poster_01	New and on sale: the underground radar!\c\nThe radar indicates possible treasure locations.\nUse this handy tool to track them down!
19-msg_d21r0101_seven2_01	I’m Mira. I was catching Pokémon, and then I\ngot lost. I’m so scared...\c\nPlease! Please take me to the exit!
19-msg_d21r0101_pair_01	You decided to escort Mira!
19-msg_d21r0101_pair_02	I’ll keep your Pokémon healthy all the time!

19-msg_d21r0101_seven2_07	That isn’t the right way. I’ll be lost if we go down.
19-msg_d21r0101_seven2_08	I like helpful Pokémon moves, like Growl\nand Minimize.\c\nThose kinds of moves are my favorites.

68-msg_ball_guide_04_1	Catching Pokémon is best accomplished by\nwhittling the target’s HP down as low as possible,\r\nthen throwing a Poké Ball.

80-msg_d26r0101_assistantm_01	Team Galactic conducts research around the\nclock here. We focus on the development of new\r\nenergy resources.
80-msg_d26r0101_assistantm_02	This is where we, Team Galactic, work. What are\nwe supposed to do?\c\nI’m not sure how, but we’re supposed to chase\nour dream—our dream of making a wonderful\r\nnew world!
80-msg_d26r0101_gingam1_01	We, Team Galactic, will take everything that can\nbe taken! We will eliminate everything that is\r\nnot needed!\c\nThat is Team Galactic’s policy!
80-msg_d26r0101_gingam1_02_1	We, Team Galactic, will take everything that can\nbe taken! We will eliminate everything that is\r\nnot needed!
80-msg_d26r0101_gingam1_02_2	That is Team Galactic’s policy!\c\nAt least, it used to be... There’s nothing left now.
80-msg_d26r0101_gingaw1_01	You’re too young for us... You can join us when\nyou’re older.
80-msg_d26r0101_gingaw1_02	I wonder where our boss went.
80-msg_d26r0107_gkanbu_01_1	So, it’s you...\c\nI’ve heard about you and what took place at the\nSpear Pillar.
80-msg_d26r0107_gkanbu_01_2	What our boss really wanted... Even I don’t\nknow that.
80-msg_d26r0107_gkanbu_01_3	His confident manner of speaking...\nHis logical words...\c\nI think people just became so enthralled by him.
80-msg_d26r0107_gkanbu_01_4	I allowed myself to believe his words because I\nwanted to see the world he intended to make.
80-msg_d26r0107_gkanbu_01_5	I’ve been left in charge of headquarters and the\nremnants of the membership.\c\nThe decision of what Team Galactic should do\nrests with me.\c\nBut I’ve learned that extremism is never\nthe solution...
80-msg_d26r0101_door_01	The door is locked. A special key is needed.

81-msg_d26r0102_bed_01	It’s a bed. Would you like to take a rest?
81-msg_d26r0102_bed_02	You quickly fell asleep in the bed...
81-msg_d26r0102_bed_03	You and your Pokémon became fully healed from\nthe rest!
81-msg_d26r0102_paper1_01	Team Galactic Nap Room\c\nEnsure the bed is unoccupied before getting\ninto it!

81-msg_d26r0102_freezer_01	There is a notice taped onto the refrigerator.\c\n“Drink all you wish, and gain the energy to move\nus forward!”\c\nThe refrigerator is filled with murky, sinister\ndrinks and nothing else.
82-msg_d26r0103_gingam_01	The locked doors only open with a special key.\c\nNow, if I was a comedy relief sort of bad guy,\nI’d tell you where the key is...\c\nBut I really don’t know!

83-msg_d26r0104_gingaboss_01_1	I see. You must be the Trainer I’ve been\nhearing about.\c\nThe foolhardy one that’s trying to stand up to\nTeam Galactic.
83-msg_d26r0104_gingaboss_01_2	Although I’d hardly expected to see that the\nTrainer is a mere child.\c\nI’d heard that our commanders had a rough time\nwith you.
83-msg_d26r0104_gingaboss_02_1	I know why you’re here. I can sense it in you.\c\nIt’s about Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf, correct?\nYou want to save them.
83-msg_d26r0104_gingaboss_02_2	I no longer have any need for them. I am finished\nwith them.\c\nIf your heart aches to save them, go right ahead.\nI could care less.\c\nIt will save me the trouble of disposing of them.
83-msg_d26r0104_gingaboss_02_3	But I must say...you are a remarkable specimen.\c\nThose Pokémon have nothing to do with you, do\nthey not?\c\nBut still you came to rescue them out of pity?\c\nSuch pitifully useless emotions... It’s illogical\nand irrational.\c\nPity and compassion are products of the weak\nand lacking human heart.\c\nYou were compelled to come here by such\nvacuous sentimentality!\c\nI will make you regret paying heed to your heart!
83-msg_d26r0104_gingaboss_03_1	I see. You are indeed strong.\c\nAnd the basis of your power is your compassion\ntoward Pokémon.
83-msg_d26r0104_gingaboss_03_2	How wasteful... Such emotions are but\nmere illusions.\c\nAnd, like all illusions, they fade over time until\ndeath banishes them forever.
83-msg_d26r0104_gingaboss_03_3	That is why I have abandoned all emotions as\nuseless sentimentality.\c\nBut that doesn’t matter. I doubt you will ever\nunderstand my position.
83-msg_d26r0104_gingaboss_03_4	That said, I recognize that you are strong and\ncourageous to come alone. This is your reward.
83-msg_d26r0104_gingaboss_04_1	The Master Ball is the ultimate Poké Ball.\c\nIt will unfailingly catch any Pokémon in the wild.
83-msg_d26r0104_gingaboss_04_2	But it is not anything that I require.\c\nUnlike you Trainers, I do not make Pokémon my\nfriends or partners.
83-msg_d26r0104_gingaboss_04_3	Unlike other Team Galactic members, I don’t use\nPokémon as tools.\c\nInstead, I make the power of Pokémon my own.
83-msg_d26r0104_gingaboss_05_1	If you wish to save the Pokémon from the lakes,\ntake the warp panel ahead.
83-msg_d26r0104_gingaboss_05_2	I am off to Mount Coronet.
83-msg_d26r0104_gingaboss_05_3	That’s correct. Mount Coronet, where you and I\nfirst met.\c\nI will ascend the mountain to its peak and then\nput an end to everything.\c\nNo. I will bring about a new beginning\nfor everything...

83-msg_d26r0104_pc_01	Team Galactic Report
83-msg_d26r0104_pc_02	Which report would you like to read?
83-msg_d26r0104_pc_03_1	Some say the universe originated from a\nmassive explosion.\c\nSimilarly, Sinnoh is thought to have been formed\nby an explosion in ancient times.
83-msg_d26r0104_pc_03_2	Needless to say, the explosion came from the\npower of a Pokémon.\c\nThe Pokémon must have been the mythical\ncreature considered a deity by the ancients.
83-msg_d26r0104_pc_03_3	Our aim is not to capture the mythical Pokémon\nbut to obtain its power...\c\nThe PC entry ends there.
83-msg_d26r0104_pc_04_1	The mythical Pokémon...\c\nAccording to myths, the Pokémon created Sinnoh\nwith its power.
83-msg_d26r0104_pc_04_2	However, capturing the Pokémon with a\nPoké Ball prevents it from using its full power.
83-msg_d26r0104_pc_04_3	But with the Red Chain, the Pokémon can be\nshackled, and its power can be used\r\nwithout restraint...
83-msg_d26r0104_pc_04_4	The PC entry ends there.
83-msg_d26r0104_pc_05_1	The Red Chain...\c\nThe Pokémon of the three lakes and\nMount Coronet are somehow connected.
83-msg_d26r0104_pc_05_2	Capturing the Pokémon of the lakes will free the\nPokémon of Mount Coronet.
83-msg_d26r0104_pc_05_3	From the Pokémon of the lakes, crystals can be\nextracted to create a Red Chain.\c\nUsing that Red Chain, the mythical Pokémon can\nbe summoned and shackled to do as\r\nwe command.
83-msg_d26r0104_pc_05_4	The PC entry ends there.
84-msg_d26r0105_gingam_01	I’m a Team Galactic member—but I don’t even\nhave a Pokémon!\c\nI’m the gruntiest of the grunts!\c\nIt’s my fault, though. I still don’t know how the\nwarp panels connect.
85-msg_d26r0106_gingam_01	Team Galactic will set free all Pokémon—all\nof nature!\c\nUwahahaha! Team Galactic will then own it all!
85-msg_d26r0106_assistantm_01	I’ve been with Team Galactic for five years.\c\nI haven’t gotten a promotion yet.
85-msg_d26r0106_door_01	The door is locked. A special key is needed.

86-msg_d26r0107_gkanbu_01_1	You...you came all the way here just to save\nsome Pokémon?\c\nThough it’s nothing new, I can’t say I understand\nour boss.
86-msg_d26r0107_gkanbu_01_2	Why would he let a kid like you come and\ngo freely?\c\nWe, Team Galactic, take all that we need and\neliminate what we do not.
86-msg_d26r0107_gkanbu_01_3	But anyway, you’ve taken the trouble to come.\nLet me welcome you!\c\nConsider it payback for your insulting me at\nthe lake.
86-msg_d26r0107_gkanbu_02	Gah! What makes you so tough?\c\nFine... Do whatever you want with those\nthree Pokémon.\c\nPress the button on that machine to set\nthem free.
86-msg_d26r0107_gkanbu_03	Press the button and set them free. Isn’t that why\nyou came?
86-msg_d26r0107_gkanbu_04_1	Our boss crafted a Red Chain from crystals he\ntook from the three Pokémon.
86-msg_d26r0107_gkanbu_04_2	That Red Chain is what he needed to shackle\nsomething on Mount Coronet.
86-msg_d26r0107_gkanbu_04_3	But that’s all I know. Who knows what he’s\nplanning to do up there.
86-msg_d26r0107_gkanbu_05	Press the button and set them free. Isn’t that why\nyou came?
86-msg_d26r0107_button_01	Would you like to press the button and set the\nPokémon free?
86-msg_d26r0107_button_02	You pressed the button and set the\nPokémon free.
86-msg_d26r0107_button_03	The button has been pressed already. You have\nto leave.

86-msg_d26r0107_machine_a_02	It’s Team Galactic’s sinister machine. Uxie had\nbeen sealed inside it.
86-msg_d26r0107_machine_b_02	It’s Team Galactic’s sinister machine. Mesprit had\nbeen sealed inside it.
86-msg_d26r0107_machine_c_02	It’s Team Galactic’s sinister machine. Azelf had\nbeen sealed inside it.
87-msg_d26r0108_assistantm_01	I cooperated with Team Galactic, but this\nexperiment has gone too far.
87-msg_d26r0108_assistantw_01	I can’t say anything in our defense.\c\nBut that thing we made... What is it going to be\nused for?

89-msg_r211b_man3_03	Let me explain how that move works without\ngetting too technical.\c\nLet’s say your opponent raises its Defense\nusing Harden.\c\nYour Pokémon can use Psych Up to get the same\nDefense boost as its opponent.\c\nBasically, your Pokémon gets the same status\nboosts as its target.

45-msg_tower_boss_02_1	Hi! My name’s Palmer.\c\nI remember you from when you were in\nTwinleaf, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYou were always playing with my son\n[VAR 0100(0001)], right?
45-msg_tower_boss_02_2	You’ve grown up since then—and most\nimpressively, too!\c\nSo, I’d like you to show me.\c\nShow me the bond you’ve built with\nyour Pokémon.
45-msg_tower_boss_02_3	Show me the skill you’ve acquired as a Trainer!
45-msg_tower_boss_03_1	So, you’ve come this far!\c\nAs the Tower Tycoon, I’ll have to give you my\nbest effort.
45-msg_tower_boss_03_2	That’s how the best Trainers show respect to\neach other.\c\nBy battling all out as dedicated students\nof Pokémon!
45-msg_tower_boss_04_1	Bravo!\c\nOne day, I imagine my son will come challenge\nme, just as you have.\c\nThat’s something I look forward to a great deal.

45-msg_tower_boss_05_2	I went out to the lake with your father that day.\c\nWe were attacked by a wild Pokémon.
45-msg_tower_boss_05_3	We fended it off, but I don’t recall how. It was\nthat desperate.\c\nThat was my first step as a Trainer. I wonder if the\nprofessor is doing well?\c\n...That’s enough reminiscing.
45-msg_tower_boss_05_4	My young friend, the world and your future hold\ninfinite promise.

58-msg_t06pc0101_man3_01	I wasn’t experienced enough for the Battle Tower.\c\nTraining on Stark Mountain might be the only\nsensible choice—for some reason, all the best\r\nTrainers in Sinnoh seem to gather there.
58-msg_t06pc0101_mystery_01	The universe was made by something born from\nan Egg...\c\nA man I met long ago told me that.
59-msg_t06r0101_oldman1_01_1	Let me tell you about Stark Mountain.\c\nThat volcano dates back to when Sinnoh was\nmade by the melding of time and space.
59-msg_t06r0101_oldman1_01_2	Fiery lava spilled out and pooled, which then\nturned into a Pokémon.\c\nIt’s said that the Magma Stone was used to keep\nthe Pokémon under control.\c\nAccording to legend, the Pokémon transformed\nover time into the heart of the volcano itself.
59-msg_t06r0101_oldman1_02	You say the Magma Stone was found? Does that\nmean the legend was true?\c\nIf so, the Pokémon of the volcano may awaken\nand cause an eruption!
59-msg_t06r0101_oldman1_03	Heatran... So there really was such a Pokémon?\nDid it come to be when Sinnoh was created?
59-msg_t06r0101_seven2_01_1	Gotcha, Gramps! I’ll put the Magma Stone back.
59-msg_t06r0101_seven2_01_2	That Magma Stone was keeping the Pokémon\nof the volcano under control.\c\nIt’s all right, though. I can go put it back myself.
59-msg_t06r0101_seven2_02_1	Whoa, I can’t believe the Magma Stone put that\nPokémon to sleep!\c\nEven so, heheh, I have to admit you’re good!

60-msg_t06r0201_fighter_01	There’s a move that doubles in power if the\nPokémon using it is poisoned, paralyzed,\r\nor burned.\c\nI’ve got Technical Machines for it right here.\nYou want them?
60-msg_t06r0201_fighter_02	Facade’s a good move for your Pokémon to have.\c\nIt makes it tough for the opponent to use\nstatus-affecting moves.

65-msg_d16r0101_rival_a_01_1	Hey, [VAR 0100(0001)]! Are you still raising\nyour Pokémon?\c\nMe? You need to ask? Of course I am—they’re\nmy partners!
65-msg_d16r0101_rival_a_01_2	I’m going to rule at the Battle Tower with them.\c\nI’ll prove how strong we’ve become and totally\nshock the guy there.
66-msg_d16r0102_seven5_01_1	Hey! [VAR 0100(0000)], right? Your buddy\nchallenged me to a battle earlier.\c\nYeah, I owned the little dude. Made sure he was\ntaught a lesson.
66-msg_d16r0102_seven5_01_2	But I don’t know if I could beat him again next\ntime. Seriously, you’re bound to run into skilled\r\nTrainers wherever you go!

66-msg_pair_01	You decided to go with Buck!

66-msg_d16r0102_seven5_03	Whoa, wait up! I can’t go on by myself if you\nleave me now.\c\nWell, if you gotta go, you gotta go. I’ll stick\naround here for you.
66-msg_d16r0102_seven5_04	There we go! There’s the exit!\c\nMy instincts tell me that the volcano’s treasure is\njust ahead of us.\c\nYou might be the toughest there is—besides me!\nSee you around, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
67-msg_pair_rival_a_01	Hey, if we run into a Pokémon, I’m gonna\ncatch it somehow—because I’m gonna be a\r\nPokémon Trainer.\c\nYou know what a Trainer does, right? How they\nhave Pokémon battles and all that?
67-msg_pair_rival_a_02	Pokémon all have different moves, huh?\c\nTrainers help their Pokémon in battle by telling\nthem which moves to use. It’s so awesomely cool.
67-msg_pair_rival_a_03	I want a Pokémon of my own, and soon. That way\nI’d be able to go anywhere I want with it.
67-msg_pair_rival_a_04	That lake has an elusive Pokémon living in it.\c\nEveryone says nothing lives there, but I know\nI’m right.
67-msg_pair_rival_a_05	I’m gonna become a Pokémon Trainer for sure.\c\nNot just any Trainer, either—I’m going to be the\ngreatest ever. That’s my dream.
67-msg_pair_rival_a_06	Hey, that’s enough talking already. I’m itching to\nget going to the lake. Come on, come on!
67-msg_r201_rival_a_07	All right, let’s move out! Hustle up!
67-msg_pair_rival_b_01	We didn’t have any choice in using those\npeople’s Pokémon, right?\c\nBut these Pokémon belong to them.\nThey’ll want them back, won’t they?\c\nBut this is the first Pokémon I’ve ever\nbattled with.
67-msg_pair_rival_b_02	I wish I could grow tougher with this little guy...
67-msg_pair_rival_b_03	I don’t feel like talking... Let’s go.\c\nAre we maybe walking slower than when we went\nto the lake?
67-msg_pair_seven1_04	It’s startling to see two wild Pokémon appear at\nthe same time.
67-msg_pair_seven1_05	My Pokémon is an excellent healer.\nBut attacking isn’t its strong point.
67-msg_pair_seven1_06	[VAR 0100(0000)], battling with you makes me\nfeel elated!\c\nIf I could predict what you’re about to do, we\nwould make a fierce combo!
67-msg_pair_seven1_07	That’s some nice moss...
67-msg_pair_seven3_08	Thanks. You really helped me out.\c\nListen, I have a Pokémon here named Luca.\nWould you take it with you?
67-msg_pair_seven4_05	You’re very chatty...
67-msg_pair_seven4_06	The Pokémon among flowers...
67-msg_pair_seven5_03	Why do I like the volcano so much?\c\nI don’t really have a good reason for it, but I\ndon’t really need one.
67-msg_pair_seven5_04_1	There’s no law that says I have to be tough or\nanything, but losing isn’t fair to my Pokémon.
67-msg_pair_seven5_04_2	After all, they try so hard for me.\c\nI think it’s my responsibility as a Trainer to\nrecognize their hard work.
67-msg_pair_seven5_05_1	My big brother is one of the Elite Four.\c\nSo, of course it’s only normal that I’d be better\nthan ordinary folks.
67-msg_pair_seven5_05_2	But that’s not what I want. I want to be tough on\nmy own terms.\c\nIt wouldn’t be fair to the Pokémon that chose to\nbe with me.
67-msg_pair_seven5_06	It might be cool being a Gym Leader or one of\nthe Elite Four...\c\nBut, then again, it sounds like it’d be a lot of\nhard work!

69-msg_r227_seven2_01_2	Anyways, if we run into each other on Stark\nMountain, the race is on to see who gets the\r\nMagma Stone first!
69-msg_r227_gymleader_01_01_1	Oh, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)]! It’s been a while!\c\nYou’ve grown so tough that you’re training out\nhere now.

69-msg_r227_rival_02_1	[VAR 0100(0000)], there’s a volcano ahead of us\ncalled Stark Mountain.\c\nThat blowhard Buck guy is on his way there,\nas well.
69-msg_r227_rival_02_2	I’m going to find the volcano’s treasure before\nthat guy does.\c\nIf I could do that, a 21-win streak at the\nBattle Tower’d be possible!
69-msg_r227_gymleader_02_1	You’re serious? You’re going to Stark Mountain?
69-msg_r227_gymleader_02_2	Even the wild Pokémon there are very,\nvery tough.\c\nIf your Pokémon aren’t well trained, they’ll have\na miserable time.
69-msg_r227_gymleader_02_3	Then again, that kind of challenge is an\nexciting prospect.\c\nBut no matter what, you’d better be\nfully prepared!\c\nI’ve got to get ready for another\ntournament. Farewell!

81-msg_d24r0105_pair_01	You decided to go with Riley!
81-msg_d24r0105_pair_02	If your Pokémon get hurt, I’ll heal them up.
81-msg_d24r0105_seven3_02	Hi, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Let’s team up.\nThe Pokémon seem to be restless.
81-msg_d24r0105_seven3_03	Are you going back?\c\nI’ll be hanging around here. It would be good if\nyou came back.
81-msg_d24r0105_seven3_04	I get it now. You’re responsible for agitating\nthe Pokémon. I don’t care what good reason\r\nyou may have, but I don’t want you bringing\r\nany trouble into my mine.
81-msg_d24r0105_gingam1_01	We’re Team Galactic! We’ll take all the Pokémon\nwe want! Isn’t that right, partner?
81-msg_d24r0105_gingam2_01	You said it, brother! So that’s what we’re\ngonna do!\c\nWe’re abducting all the Pokémon from this\nrusted-out Iron Island!

81-msg_d24r0105_seven3_08	Thank you... But you don’t have room to take\nanother Pokémon.\c\nAll right, then. I’ll wait here for you.
81-msg_d24r0105_seven3_09	I hope you’ll accept it as a token of\nour friendship.

81-msg_d24r0105_seven3_13	Haha, I’d have to agree.\c\nYou might say the folks who train here have a bit\ntoo much time on their hands.
81-msg_d24r0105_seven3_14	This used to be a fairly thriving ore mine once\nupon a time.\c\nI guess the iron ore for steel was totally played\nout. There’s only Pokémon here now.
81-msg_d24r0105_seven3_15	Have you met Byron? The Leader of the\nCanalave Gym?\c\nHe’s asked me to become a Gym Leader,\nbut there’s his son Roark to consider.

81-msg_d24r0105_seven3_16_2	Would that be like battling yourself, I wonder?\c\nI mean, it’s a lot harder to defeat one’s self than\nanyone else.
81-msg_d24r0105_seven3_17	What’s going on here, though? The native\nPokémon are restless...\c\nI don’t like this. Let’s hurry.
82-msg_d24r0201_leader_01_1	Hm? You’re in training, then?\c\nYou know, my son trains as hard as you do.\nBut I still treat him as if he were a child.
82-msg_d24r0201_leader_01_2	It’s ridiculous, really. He is a proper Gym Leader\nand all. It’s always tricky between a father and\r\nson, it seems.\c\nHumph, I’ve wasted your time. Take this as\nmy apology!
82-msg_d24r0201_leader_02	There are Pokémon that evolve into Steel types\nby using that Metal Coat. They need to hold that\r\nitem while being traded to evolve.\c\nTry using it if you’d like. Farewell!

83-msg_d27r0101_doctor_03	Hm... There is one thing I can say.\c\nThere are many rare kinds of Pokémon in Sinnoh.\nThe region should serve us very well in regard to\r\nour studies.

83-msg_d27r0101_rival_04	It’s...a briefcase? Those people forgot it here.\c\nWhat are we supposed to do with it? We can try\nto return it, but who were they?\c\nI heard them say “professor”...

83-msg_d27r0101_rival_13_2	They were other people’s Pokémon...\c\nBut we had to use them! Those people won’t\nmind, will they?
83-msg_d27r0101_heroine_04	Oh! There’s the briefcase!\c\nThe professor would have been furious if I’d\nlost it...
83-msg_d27r0101_heroine_05_1	Huh? Oh, no!\c\nDid...did you use the Pokémon that were in here?
83-msg_d27r0101_heroine_05_2	You did?! Oh my gosh! What’s the professor\ngoing to say? This is so not good...\c\nI’ll take this briefcase for now.
83-msg_d27r0101_hero_04	Whew! You found the briefcase?\c\nThe professor would’ve gone through the roof if\nhe knew I forgot it here.
83-msg_d27r0101_hero_05_1	Hunh? Whaaaat?!\c\nDid you guys... Did you use these Pokémon?!
83-msg_d27r0101_hero_05_2	Oh, man... How am I gonna explain this to\nthe professor?\c\nThis is the professor’s briefcase, so I’ll take\nit, OK?
83-msg_d27r0101_rival_14	What was that about?
83-msg_d27r0101_rival_15_1	I don’t know what’s going on. [VAR 0100(0000)],\nlet’s get out of here.

84-msg_d27r0102_gkanbu_02_1	I lost again...\c\nSo, first it was the Valley Windworks, and now it’s\nLake Verity that I owe you for! This shouldn’t be\r\nhappening to a Team Galactic Commander...
84-msg_d27r0102_gkanbu_02_2	Calm down, Mars...\c\nI’ve done my part in all of this. My mission was to\ntransport the lake’s Pokémon to our HQ...
84-msg_d27r0102_gkanbu_02_3	That’s right! I accomplished my mission without\na problem!
84-msg_d27r0102_gkanbu_03	Team! We’re pulling out! The boss is waiting at\nthe HQ!
84-msg_d27r0102_gkanbu_04_1	The Pokémon of the three lakes are\nconnected somehow.\c\nThanks to Saturn’s grandstanding at Lake Valor,\na cavern appeared here. It was the cavern where\r\nthe Pokémon Mesprit slept.
84-msg_d27r0102_gkanbu_04_2	Mesprit appeared, too, probably to go help\nits friends.\c\nThat worked out well for us. It was super easy\nto catch.

92-msg_hyouka_z04	Have you visited the Great Marsh?\c\nSome Pokémon only appear in places such\nas that.
92-msg_hyouka_z05	As you know, there are Pokémon that\neventually evolve.\c\nThat’s an important thing to consider when\nyou’re filling your Pokédex.
92-msg_hyouka_z06	You’ve proven yourself capable. There’s nothing\nto worry about.\c\nKeep catching Pokémon the way you’ve been\ndoing so far.
92-msg_hyouka_z07	Are you aware that there is more than one style\nof Evolution?\c\nThere are some Pokémon that evolve by\nbecoming friends with the Trainer.
92-msg_hyouka_z08	Apparently, there are some Pokémon that appear\nin swarms on occasion.\c\nDon’t miss out on these massive outbreaks\nof Pokémon!
92-msg_hyouka_z09	Amazing! You’ve already gotten over three\nhundred Pokémon!\c\nThat’s already a major achievement, but I know\nyou’re capable of more!
92-msg_hyouka_z10	Some wild Pokémon only appear during certain\ntimes of the day.\c\nYou’ll need to look for Pokémon around\nthe clock.
92-msg_hyouka_z11_1	I’ve been getting reports of different Pokémon\nsightings in places like the Grand Underground.\c\nBy “different,” I mean Pokémon that aren’t native\nto the Sinnoh region.
92-msg_hyouka_z11_2	You should perhaps go back to areas you’ve\nalready scoured.\c\nYou may end up seeing Pokémon that weren’t\nthere before.

92-msg_hyouka_z14	Hmm... You’ve caught quite the impressive\ncollection of Pokémon.\c\nYou’ve obviously had to employ many means to\nseek them all out.\c\nKeep an eye out for rustling tall grass, and search\nit thoroughly.
92-msg_hyouka_z15	I can only marvel at the diversity of Pokémon.\nI’m still very much in awe of them.
92-msg_hyouka_z16	Good, good. You’re getting close to completing\nthe Pokédex.\c\nI’m looking forward to seeing its completion.\c\nWhen that happens, your views about Pokémon\nwill likely have changed!

3-msg_c08r0301_boy2b_01	You should work together with friends to collect\nGlossy Stones before you dig up Fossils!\c\nApparently something good’ll happen if you\ndo that!
3-msg_c08r0301_sunglasses_01	Once, when I was in the Grand Underground,\nI fainted...\r\nBut then Roark rescued me!
27-msg_r224_stele_02	[VAR 0100(0001)], to whom I give\nmy thanks.
44-msg_d31r0201_gorggeousm1a_01	Only a handful of Trainers are tough enough for\nMaster Class battles.\c\nI’d love to take on that challenge someday!
44-msg_touroku_01	Giving a self-introduction before a battle can\nreally help psych you up!
93-msg_fld_item_use_01	You used the [VAR 0109(0001)]!
93-msg_fld_item_use_02	The grassy patch remained quiet...
93-msg_fld_item_use_03	Saved Battle Points: [VAR 0203(0000)] BP
20-msg_c10r0103_bigfour1_11_1	Hi there! I’m Aaron.\c\nBut actually, I’ve battled with you before,\nhaven’t I?\c\nWait a moment! My bug Pokémon are buzzing\nabout something...\c\nYou must have gotten even stronger! The hunch\nof a Bug-type Pokémon is rarely wrong.\c\nAll right, then! I’ll battle you once more with all\nmy strength!
20-msg_c10r0103_bigfour1_11_2	Ahhh... Today, as always, my bug Pokémon were\ntruly beautiful.\c\nThey didn’t waste a single motion, and they\npulled off some perfectly–polished moves.\c\nThe only thing that held them back from winning\nwas my own weakness.\c\nIf I can improve myself, then they’ll get a chance\nto shine brighter than Beautifly wings in the sun!\c\nLet’s hear it for my Pokémon!
20-msg_c10r0103_bigfour1_11_3	Whoops. Got a little carried away again...\nAnyway, carry on to the next room!\c\nStronger Trainers than I will put you to the test!
20-msg_c10r0103_bigfour1_21_1	Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI had a hunch you’d be back for more battles!\nI guess you could say a little bug told me.\c\nAnd I can tell just by looking that your Pokémon\nare more beautiful and polished than before—\r\nof course, so are mine!\c\nSo now, let me show you the Evolutionary power\nof bug Pokémon!
20-msg_c10r0103_bigfour1_21_2	This brings me back to when I first discovered\nbug Pokémon...\c\nI couldn’t believe how sharply they’d polished\ntheir survival skills. Ever since then, I’ve devoted\r\nmyself to following the beauty of the Bug type.\c\nBut as much as it bugs me to lose like this to you,\nI’ll never stop aiming for perfection.\c\nThat way, I can keep on showing the wonder of\nbug Pokémon to the world!
20-msg_c10r0103_bigfour1_21_3	And now, on to the next room! My bug Pokémon\nhave already spread the buzz about your victory!
20-msg_c10r0105_bigfour2_11_1	Well, well. I see you’ve returned, dear child.\c\nIt looks as though you’ve grown more confident\nsince the last time we met.\c\nBut don’t forget—with age comes the power to\nshake the earth, and a force of will that can split\r\nthe ground beneath your feet!\c\nAhahaha! Let this old lady show you what a little\nlife experience can do.
20-msg_c10r0105_bigfour2_11_2	No matter how the world shifts, you and your\nPokémon will always be sure-footed.\c\nYou’re steadier today than all the days before!
20-msg_c10r0105_bigfour2_11_3	Ahahaha! Now continue to go as far as you want!
20-msg_c10r0105_bigfour2_21_1	Oh, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou sure look different from last time we met.\c\nWhy, now you hold yourself just like an adult.\nYou remind me of when I was young...\c\nAhahaha!\c\nBut I know you’re not here to hear an old lady’s\nramblings. Let’s let the battle do the talking.
20-msg_c10r0105_bigfour2_21_2	Now then, let me leave you with a last little bit\nof advice....\c\nEven if you find yourself losing someday, and\neven if your feelings are crushed, remember to\r\nremain as strong as the earth beneath your feet.
20-msg_c10r0105_bigfour2_21_3	Ahahaha!\c\nI look forward to seeing just how far you go!
20-msg_c10r0107_bigfour3_11_1	Yo, Trainer! I’ve been waiting on the edge of my\nseat for you to come!\c\nI’ve been training myself for this moment, so you\nwon’t catch me running out of gas again!\c\nI won’t just bring the heat—I’m going supernova!\c\nHope you’re warmed up, because here comes\nthe Big Bang!
20-msg_c10r0107_bigfour3_11_2	...\c\n...\c\n...\c\nWhew. Burnt right down to cinders...
20-msg_c10r0107_bigfour3_11_3	...\c\n...\c\n...\c\nCome again soon.
20-msg_c10r0107_bigfour3_21_1	Yo, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI’ve been boiling over waiting to see you again!\c\nAny battle with you is guaranteed to get heated.\c\nBut right now, my soul is burning at 15 million\ndegrees—hotter than the surface of the sun!
20-msg_c10r0107_bigfour3_21_2	...\c\n...\c\n...\c\nWhew. Burnt right down to cinders...
20-msg_c10r0107_bigfour3_21_3	...\c\n...\c\n...\c\nLet’s do this again sometime.
20-msg_c10r0109_bigfour4_11_1	Just a moment, please. The book I’m reading has\nnearly reached its thrilling climax...\c\nThe hero has obtained a mystic sword and is\nabout to face their final trial...\c\nAh, never mind. Since you’ve made it this far,\nI’ll put that aside and battle you.\c\nLet me see if you’ll achieve as much glory as\nthe hero of my book!
20-msg_c10r0109_bigfour4_11_2	Truly outstanding. You took full control of the\nnarrative without a moment’s hesitation.\c\nNow then, the final page has yet to be written.\c\nGo and show us who shall emerge victorious.
20-msg_c10r0109_bigfour4_11_3	Now then, I can return to the last remaining\nchapter of my book.\c\nReading allows me to learn from my mistakes.\nKnowledge keeps me from making more.
20-msg_c10r0109_bigfour4_21_1	Ah, you’ve timed your arrival perfectly. I’m still\nquite worked up from the book I just finished.\c\nAfter seeing all you’ve accomplished thus far,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], I can certainly tell you this:\r\nyou are the protagonist of your own story.\c\nAnd perhaps that just makes me an obstacle\nstanding in the way of your heroic journey.\c\nThen again, maybe in this retelling I’ll finally trip\nyou up! Wouldn’t that be an intriguing plot twist?
20-msg_c10r0109_bigfour4_21_2	I concede defeat...\c\nI used every stratagem at my command, but you\npersevered through them all.\c\nNow all that remains is for you to write your\nown epilogue!
20-msg_c10r0109_bigfour4_21_3	Next I think I’d like to read a book about a star...\none small light, illuminating a galaxy of darkness.
20-msg_c10r0111_champion_11_1a	How have you been?\c\nI recently saw my grandma in Celestic Town for\nthe first time in quite a while.\c\nShe sure had lots of nice things to say about you!\c\nObviously it’s important to battle well and win,\nbut I think a truly great Trainer is one who makes\r\nthe people and Pokémon around them happy.\c\nThat’s why I’m so glad that you’re the one who’s\nchallenging me today!\c\nI will accept your challenge with everything\nI’ve got!
20-msg_c10r0111_champion_11_2	Throughout this battle, I managed to catch a\nglimpse of everything that brought you this far:\r\nyour love of Pokémon, your talent as a Trainer,\r\nand the friendships you’ve made along the way.\c\nI can’t tell you how happy I was to see all that.\nYou truly earned your place in the Hall of Fame!
20-msg_c10r0111_champion_21_1b	Thank you for coming back, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nAs you know, I am Sinnoh’s Champion.\c\nChampion... That word carries so much pressure.\c\nIt doesn’t happen often, but whenever a Trainer\ncomes to challenge me, I know that they carry\r\nwith them all their hopes and dreams...\c\nAnd so, I respect their passion by giving them my\nall in battle—without losing the dignity and poise\r\nexpected from the Champion, of course.\c\nForgive me for airing my petty complaints. I only\ntell you because you’ve defeated me before.\c\nBut I’ve said too much. The time has come!\c\nPlease do me the honor of battling my team with\nall your might!

20-msg_c10r0111_champion_21_2	I could tell from this battle that each of our\nPokémon gave every last bit of their strength.\c\nNot once did either of our teams hesitate!\nThank you for such a refreshing experience!
20-msg_c10r0111_champion_21_3	I know now that I can entrust my Sticker to you.\c\nI’ve imbued it with everything that made me\na Champion. Please accept it!
20-msg_c10r0111_champion_11_1b	How have you been?\c\nOne look at you tells me many things about you.\c\nTogether, you and your Pokémon overcame all\nthe challenges you’ve faced, however difficult,\r\nand came out even stronger.\c\nObviously it’s important to battle well and win,\nbut I think a truly great Trainer is one who makes\r\nthe people and Pokémon around them happy.\c\nThat’s why I’m so glad that you’re the one who’s\nchallenging me today!\c\nI will accept your challenge with everything\nI’ve got!

0-mes_tower_tr_001_01	Here I come!
0-mes_tower_tr_001_02	Yeah!
0-mes_tower_tr_001_03	Bleah!
0-mes_tower_tr_002_01	Hey, rookie! Bring it on!
0-mes_tower_tr_002_02	Yeah, I knew it. You’re a rookie after all.
0-mes_tower_tr_002_03	Bleah! You’re just a rookie!
0-mes_tower_tr_003_01	I gotta say it—shorts are the best! They remain\ncomfy and easy to wear!
0-mes_tower_tr_003_02	Shorts are the greatest!
0-mes_tower_tr_003_03	I’ll never stop wearing shorts. Not for anybody!
0-mes_tower_tr_004_01	I make it a policy to wear miniskirts!
0-mes_tower_tr_004_02	Miniskirts are the ultimate!
0-mes_tower_tr_004_03	What’s your policy?
0-mes_tower_tr_005_01	I love my miniskirt!
0-mes_tower_tr_005_02	Caught you snoozing!
0-mes_tower_tr_005_03	Miniskirts make legs look longer! Is that a\ngood thing?
0-mes_tower_tr_006_01	I’m on the lookout for adorable clothes.
0-mes_tower_tr_006_02	Let me know if you find anything nice!
0-mes_tower_tr_006_03	I wish I could dress up!
0-mes_tower_tr_007_01	I want to test out something I learned at\nprivate school.
0-mes_tower_tr_007_02	Yes! It worked perfectly!
0-mes_tower_tr_007_03	Hmm... Something’s wrong here.
0-mes_tower_tr_008_01	Uh... Wroar!
0-mes_tower_tr_008_02	A battle is about momentum and willpower.
0-mes_tower_tr_008_03	OK, so willpower doesn’t cut it on its own.
0-mes_tower_tr_009_01	I study every day because I want to work\nall over the world.
0-mes_tower_tr_009_02	My dream is worldwide!
0-mes_tower_tr_009_03	I need to study up on Pokémon battles.
0-mes_tower_tr_010_01	When I grow up, I’m going to be a\nPokémon Professor!
0-mes_tower_tr_010_02	Er-hem! Er-hem! You’ve much to learn, youngster!
0-mes_tower_tr_010_03	Er-hem! Er-hem! Seems I’ve much to learn still!
0-mes_tower_tr_011_01	When the subject is Pokémon, I simply don’t lose!
0-mes_tower_tr_011_02	It’s a victory of knowledge!
0-mes_tower_tr_011_03	I’m going to review the subject—and I’ll subject\nyou to my revenge!
0-mes_tower_tr_012_01	Oh, now you look wimpy. I might win this.
0-mes_tower_tr_012_02	I so did it!
0-mes_tower_tr_012_03	Ouch, that hurt.
0-mes_tower_tr_013_01	It’s fine, fine. No need to say a word.
0-mes_tower_tr_013_02	It’s fine, fine. You tried your best, I know.
0-mes_tower_tr_013_03	It’s fine, fine... No need to say a word...
0-mes_tower_tr_014_01	I’m rich!
0-mes_tower_tr_014_02	Well, of course. I’m rich.
0-mes_tower_tr_014_03	What happened? I’m rich, aren’t I?
0-mes_tower_tr_015_01	Hmm. So, you’re good, huh?
0-mes_tower_tr_015_02	Hmm. You’re no big deal. Hmm?
0-mes_tower_tr_015_03	Hmm. So, you are good. Hmm.
0-mes_tower_tr_016_01	Oh, yes. I shall attack now.
0-mes_tower_tr_016_02	I’ve done it!
0-mes_tower_tr_016_03	Oh, how disappointing.
0-mes_tower_tr_017_01	Your adventure is over. Come hither and\nget whupped!
0-mes_tower_tr_017_02	A done deal, it was.
0-mes_tower_tr_017_03	Oh, how vexing this is. Verily, I thank you.
0-mes_tower_tr_018_01	How boring...
0-mes_tower_tr_018_02	So truly boring...
0-mes_tower_tr_018_03	That was a good way to waste some time.
0-mes_tower_tr_019_01	Huh? Where is everyone?
0-mes_tower_tr_019_02	Hey, guys! Where are you?!
0-mes_tower_tr_019_03	I came to camp, but I think I got separated\nfrom my friends...
0-mes_tower_tr_020_01	Oh! You have a Pokétch too?
0-mes_tower_tr_020_02	I was fooling around with my Pokétch,\nbut I still won!
0-mes_tower_tr_020_03	I was fooling around with my Pokétch,\nand I lost...
0-mes_tower_tr_021_01	My Pokémon trained in the forest.
0-mes_tower_tr_021_02	It’s the power of the forest.
0-mes_tower_tr_021_03	I’m going back to the forest.
0-mes_tower_tr_022_01	I’ll battle you like I’m on a picnic!
0-mes_tower_tr_022_02	Lalala!
0-mes_tower_tr_022_03	Pretending this is a picnic won’t let me win.
0-mes_tower_tr_023_01	Ooh la la! Here we come!
0-mes_tower_tr_023_02	Ooh la la! So happy I won!
0-mes_tower_tr_023_03	Ooh la la! Even losing can’t dampen my spirits!
0-mes_tower_tr_024_01	I’ll teach you what’s fun about battling.
0-mes_tower_tr_024_02	Battling me was fun, wasn’t it?
0-mes_tower_tr_024_03	Oh my, that was inspiring! You’re the greatest!
0-mes_tower_tr_025_01	I—I can swim, really! I don’t need my inner tube!
0-mes_tower_tr_025_02	It—It’s true!
0-mes_tower_tr_025_03	I—I’m not lying!
0-mes_tower_tr_026_01	I like rivers more than the sea. Which do\nyou prefer?
0-mes_tower_tr_026_02	River water is cold, but it feels just super.
0-mes_tower_tr_026_03	I don’t like the sea because the salt water burns\nmy eyes!
0-mes_tower_tr_027_01	Go, go, go! Go, my Pokémon!
0-mes_tower_tr_027_02	That’s the way! Way to go, my Pokémon!
0-mes_tower_tr_027_03	Good effort! Way to go, my Pokémon!
0-mes_tower_tr_028_01	The beach sand is so hot! It makes me go,\n“Ouch, ouch, ouch!”
0-mes_tower_tr_028_02	I love the sea!
0-mes_tower_tr_028_03	Ouch, ouch, ouch!
0-mes_tower_tr_029_01	Splish, splash!
0-mes_tower_tr_029_02	Ker-splash! Ker-splash!
0-mes_tower_tr_029_03	Flip, flop!
0-mes_tower_tr_030_01	I’m a girl in love with her inner tube!\nNice to meet you!
0-mes_tower_tr_030_02	Thank you! I’m a girl in love with her inner tube!
0-mes_tower_tr_030_03	Good-bye! I’m a girl in love with her inner tube!
0-mes_tower_tr_031_01	Oh yeah, I’m feeling it! I’m tuned in to\nyour wavelength!
0-mes_tower_tr_031_02	Tadaaaah!
0-mes_tower_tr_031_03	Tch! Losing threw off my rhythm!
0-mes_tower_tr_032_01	Rock? Jazz? Techno?\nAnything’ll do for my soundtrack!
0-mes_tower_tr_032_02	*squeeeeeal*
0-mes_tower_tr_032_03	So, yeah... You’ve got me in the mood for singing\nthe blues...
0-mes_tower_tr_033_01	Let’s get this jam session on!
0-mes_tower_tr_033_02	You’re obviously short on practice.
0-mes_tower_tr_033_03	My dream of a world tour... It seems so far away...
0-mes_tower_tr_034_01	Oh, hello... Well, aren’t you chic?
0-mes_tower_tr_034_02	How about recommending me a shop?
0-mes_tower_tr_034_03	Oh, you! You’re not just fashionable, you’re good\nwith Pokémon too! How unfair!
0-mes_tower_tr_035_01	Thanks for supporting me!
0-mes_tower_tr_035_02	Oh? You’re not my fan?
0-mes_tower_tr_035_03	What a horrible way to treat an idol...
0-mes_tower_tr_036_01	La, lala, lah.
0-mes_tower_tr_036_02	La lalala. Lalalah lah.
0-mes_tower_tr_036_03	Bye-bye, lalah!
0-mes_tower_tr_037_01	Let’s see who loves Pokémon more, you or me.
0-mes_tower_tr_037_02	Fuhaha! Looks like my love for Pokémon\ntrumped yours!
0-mes_tower_tr_037_03	Grr... Your love of Pokémon is stronger\nthan mine?
0-mes_tower_tr_038_01	I tell ya, my Pokémon are some kind of tough.
0-mes_tower_tr_038_02	You don’t want to underestimate me.
0-mes_tower_tr_038_03	You’re some kind of mighty.
0-mes_tower_tr_039_01	OK, show me your favorite Pokémon.\nDon’t be shy now, come on.
0-mes_tower_tr_039_02	I see... Cute, but on the weak side.
0-mes_tower_tr_039_03	I see! Cute, and yet tough.
0-mes_tower_tr_040_01	My Pokémon are cute, but they’re not\nvery tough!
0-mes_tower_tr_040_02	Oh? We won? Seriously?
0-mes_tower_tr_040_03	It’s OK. I like my Pokémon. That’s all\nthat matters.
0-mes_tower_tr_041_01	I’ve been pampering my gang too much lately.\nCan they do this?
0-mes_tower_tr_041_02	Ooh, they did it! I knew I could count on\nmy gang!
0-mes_tower_tr_041_03	Pampering Pokémon too much is no good...
0-mes_tower_tr_042_01	Won’t you join our Pokémon Fan Club?
0-mes_tower_tr_042_02	There’re all sorts of fun things to\ndo if you join!
0-mes_tower_tr_042_03	Join us! Become a Poké Fan like me!
0-mes_tower_tr_043_01	May I take your order, please?
0-mes_tower_tr_043_02	Ah, a fine choice—one loss served fresh.
0-mes_tower_tr_043_03	Ah, an excellent choice—a win served fresh.
0-mes_tower_tr_044_01	What I really hoped to become was a cook.
0-mes_tower_tr_044_02	I don’t mind this job now, mind you.
0-mes_tower_tr_044_03	I just find it hard talking to strangers.
0-mes_tower_tr_045_01	For battles and order-taking, speed is essential!
0-mes_tower_tr_045_02	Like, chop-chop! You got served.
0-mes_tower_tr_045_03	Food is like battling. Serve it while it’s hot!
0-mes_tower_tr_046_01	My job is about serving others. But don’t expect\nme to take orders here.
0-mes_tower_tr_046_02	Mufufu.
0-mes_tower_tr_046_03	Why couldn’t you serve me? You won’t make\nfriends that way!
0-mes_tower_tr_047_01	See my uniform? Isn’t it cute?
0-mes_tower_tr_047_02	It’s my favorite!
0-mes_tower_tr_047_03	You messed up my uniform!
0-mes_tower_tr_048_01	You’re good, aren’t you?
0-mes_tower_tr_048_02	Oops. I’m a little disappointed.
0-mes_tower_tr_048_03	I knew you were a tough Trainer.
0-mes_tower_tr_049_01	I catch and raise all sorts of Pokémon.
0-mes_tower_tr_049_02	See? I’ve raised them pretty good.
0-mes_tower_tr_049_03	I need to raise my Pokémon some more!
0-mes_tower_tr_050_01	I’ll snag you with my net!
0-mes_tower_tr_050_02	It’s in the bag!
0-mes_tower_tr_050_03	Hey! Don’t run away!
0-mes_tower_tr_051_01	Where can I find a giant Heracross?
0-mes_tower_tr_051_02	I want a huge Heracross—like, king-size!
0-mes_tower_tr_051_03	If only I had a giant Heracross...
0-mes_tower_tr_052_01	Prepare to lose!
0-mes_tower_tr_052_02	The enemy is mine!
0-mes_tower_tr_052_03	I lie shattered...
0-mes_tower_tr_053_01	Behold my fearsome ninja technique!
0-mes_tower_tr_053_02	Haha! You saw it!
0-mes_tower_tr_053_03	You didn’t fall for my fake ninja boasting!
0-mes_tower_tr_054_01	I shall become a real ninja when I grow up!
0-mes_tower_tr_054_02	Excellent! Excellent!
0-mes_tower_tr_054_03	So, what’s a real ninja supposed to do?
0-mes_tower_tr_055_01	Should I torment you?
0-mes_tower_tr_055_02	Yay! Yay!
0-mes_tower_tr_055_03	No! No tormenting me!
0-mes_tower_tr_056_01	My mommy made this outfit for me.
0-mes_tower_tr_056_02	Isn’t it cute?
0-mes_tower_tr_056_03	My mommy is really good at sewing.
0-mes_tower_tr_057_01	Let’s do our best, everyone!
0-mes_tower_tr_057_02	Thanks, everyone!
0-mes_tower_tr_057_03	Waaaaah!
0-mes_tower_tr_058_01	Sure, we’re going to battle, but don’t be over\nthe top about it.
0-mes_tower_tr_058_02	Hey, relax, relax. It’s best to be natural, yeah?
0-mes_tower_tr_058_03	You have to loosen up some more.
0-mes_tower_tr_059_01	Fish, fish, fish, that’s what I do! I’m gonna fish\nit all up!
0-mes_tower_tr_059_02	Kahaha! I am at the top of my game!
0-mes_tower_tr_059_03	Oh, waaah! I let that one get away!
0-mes_tower_tr_060_01	Exploring ruins isn’t all fun and games!
0-mes_tower_tr_060_02	Your skill level says you probably wouldn’t make\na good Ruin Maniac.
0-mes_tower_tr_060_03	Danger lurks everywhere in ruins!
0-mes_tower_tr_061_01	These mates of mine traveled the world with me!
0-mes_tower_tr_061_02	What do you say? Pretty tough, right?
0-mes_tower_tr_061_03	Maybe it’s time we hit the road again...
0-mes_tower_tr_062_01	Hey there! Check out my rare Pokémon!
0-mes_tower_tr_062_02	My Pokémon aren’t just rare, either.\nThey’re tough, too!
0-mes_tower_tr_062_03	Whoa! Hey! Wait! No! Stop! Don’t touch!
0-mes_tower_tr_063_01	Now just be patient. I’ll show you my\nprivate collection!
0-mes_tower_tr_063_02	See, see? Weren’t they awesome?\nThey’re the most super of the über!
0-mes_tower_tr_063_03	Awawawah... M—My Pokémon...
0-mes_tower_tr_064_01	Look! This is my favorite parasol—oh, and my\nfabulous Pokémon!
0-mes_tower_tr_064_02	Aren’t they both cute?
0-mes_tower_tr_064_03	I’m only showing you! You can’t have any!
0-mes_tower_tr_065_01	Have you ever seen a rainbow?
0-mes_tower_tr_065_02	Have you wondered what lies beyond\na rainbow?
0-mes_tower_tr_065_03	Seeing a rainbow makes me think good things\nare in store.
0-mes_tower_tr_066_01	If you were the weather, what would you be now?
0-mes_tower_tr_066_02	Right now, I’m feeling sunny without a cloud in\nthe sky!
0-mes_tower_tr_066_03	I’m feeling fogbound...
0-mes_tower_tr_067_01	I really don’t like weak Trainers!
0-mes_tower_tr_067_02	You don’t inspire much trust...
0-mes_tower_tr_067_03	A Pokémon Trainer should be tough and bursting\nwith life!
0-mes_tower_tr_068_01	Lately, I’ve had a lot to worry about...
0-mes_tower_tr_068_02	Winning makes all my worries seem trivial!
0-mes_tower_tr_068_03	You just added to my worries...
0-mes_tower_tr_069_01	This may hurt a little bit, but we’ll be done quick.\nHold still!
0-mes_tower_tr_069_02	There! Done!
0-mes_tower_tr_069_03	Ooh, no! That hurts!
0-mes_tower_tr_070_01	*sniff* *sniffle*
0-mes_tower_tr_070_02	*sniffle* *snuffle*\nI think I have a cold...
0-mes_tower_tr_070_03	*sniff* *sniffle*\nMy nose is clogging up...
0-mes_tower_tr_071_01	*sniff*
0-mes_tower_tr_071_02	Now what could this aroma be?
0-mes_tower_tr_071_03	Are you wearing a fragrance? You smell sort\nof nice!
0-mes_tower_tr_072_01	You’re going to lose, but you’ll get to enjoy\na nice aroma!
0-mes_tower_tr_072_02	Kyahaha! That’s what you get for swooning\nto my aroma!
0-mes_tower_tr_072_03	Argh! I am so angry!
0-mes_tower_tr_073_01	Let my guitar howl! Hear me scream!
0-mes_tower_tr_073_02	Yeahey!
0-mes_tower_tr_073_03	Giyaaaah!
0-mes_tower_tr_074_01	You should channel your feelings into songs\nwith sincerity.
0-mes_tower_tr_074_02	The way I feel now? It’s rock ’n’ roll!
0-mes_tower_tr_074_03	The way I feel now is kind of folksy.
0-mes_tower_tr_075_01	Now hear me—I’ll tell you the Bird Keeper’s\nnumber one motto!
0-mes_tower_tr_075_02	Soar high on a win!
0-mes_tower_tr_075_03	Rest your wings on a loss!
0-mes_tower_tr_076_01	Let’s both do our best!
0-mes_tower_tr_076_02	Yup, we both did the best we could!
0-mes_tower_tr_076_03	Good going!
0-mes_tower_tr_077_01	Fly, fly, fly! We’re going to rule this battle!
0-mes_tower_tr_077_02	*zoooooom*
0-mes_tower_tr_077_03	We’re gonna crash!
0-mes_tower_tr_078_01	I’m the sailor among sailors! I was born on the\nhigh seas!
0-mes_tower_tr_078_02	The waves rocked me to sleep! The sea was\nmy mother!
0-mes_tower_tr_078_03	Urp... Gweh... So, when I get up on land,\nI get no-motion sickness...
0-mes_tower_tr_079_01	The sea, my beautiful sea!
0-mes_tower_tr_079_02	Oh... I hear them... I hear the sound of waves...
0-mes_tower_tr_079_03	I want to become a big man. Big like the sea big.
0-mes_tower_tr_080_01	Yahoo!
0-mes_tower_tr_080_02	Come on! You holler too!
0-mes_tower_tr_080_03	Gweff! Hack! Hack! Hollering choked me up!
0-mes_tower_tr_081_01	You should aspire to the hiker’s way of life!
0-mes_tower_tr_081_02	You see? You love my lifestyle, don’t you?
0-mes_tower_tr_081_03	Come on, now! You should look up to the way\nI live!
0-mes_tower_tr_082_01	My Pokémon and I are idols!
0-mes_tower_tr_082_02	Say what you will! We’re idols!
0-mes_tower_tr_082_03	We have you beat when it comes down\nto popularity...
0-mes_tower_tr_083_01	Watch me! All eyes on me!
0-mes_tower_tr_083_02	Ooh... This is what I live for...
0-mes_tower_tr_083_03	I became an idol because I wanted everyone\nto see me!
0-mes_tower_tr_084_01	I’m too into battling... They might fire me from\nmy job as an idol...
0-mes_tower_tr_084_02	Battling is too much fun!
0-mes_tower_tr_084_03	I can’t help myself. No one can keep me\nfrom battling.
0-mes_tower_tr_085_01	I run a marathon every morning. It’s great!
0-mes_tower_tr_085_02	My buff physique makes for easy wins!
0-mes_tower_tr_085_03	So I lost. I can still run great marathons!
0-mes_tower_tr_086_01	I’ll run in place while battling for the good of\nmy health.
0-mes_tower_tr_086_02	Let’s hear it for good health!
0-mes_tower_tr_086_03	*gasp*\nMy ankle! I rolled my ankle!
0-mes_tower_tr_087_01	Out of the way! I’ve got deliveries to make!
0-mes_tower_tr_087_02	What? You want me to deliver you\nsomewhere, too?
0-mes_tower_tr_087_03	All the delivering I do every day...\nI’ve got deep muscle pain!
0-mes_tower_tr_088_01	It was me who put up the buildings around\nthese parts.
0-mes_tower_tr_088_02	So, what do you think? Cool stuff, huh?
0-mes_tower_tr_088_03	My dream is to make a building taller than\na mountain!
0-mes_tower_tr_089_01	Smell that? That’s the smell of hay clinging to\nmy body.
0-mes_tower_tr_089_02	Whoa!
0-mes_tower_tr_089_03	This smell I have is the sweet scent of hay that\nPokémon surely love.
0-mes_tower_tr_090_01	All right, take a run at me! My barrel chest can\ntake it!
0-mes_tower_tr_090_02	What, that’s all you’ve got? You can take a\nharder run at me!
0-mes_tower_tr_090_03	Ooh... Ow... That hurt... It’s like you broke my\nbarrel chest...
0-mes_tower_tr_091_01	I’m not getting any younger. I can’t\noverexert myself.
0-mes_tower_tr_091_02	What I lack in youth, I make up for\nin experience.
0-mes_tower_tr_091_03	Oh, you’re good and young. There’s a sparkle\nabout you.
0-mes_tower_tr_092_01	Hey! You there, Trainer! You and me,\nwe’re battling!
0-mes_tower_tr_092_02	Owned!
0-mes_tower_tr_092_03	Unbelievable!
0-mes_tower_tr_093_01	These here are my Pokémon. I raised them with\nmy ma and pa.
0-mes_tower_tr_093_02	Sure right kind of tough, aren’t they?
0-mes_tower_tr_093_03	Well, I’ll be! We lost that one!
0-mes_tower_tr_094_01	I’m going to do my level best. You’d better\nkeep up!
0-mes_tower_tr_094_02	Whew! We sure did our best!
0-mes_tower_tr_094_03	Yup! We tried hard, y’all!
0-mes_tower_tr_095_01	OK, everyone! Big smiles!
0-mes_tower_tr_095_02	Big smiles! Come on!
0-mes_tower_tr_095_03	That’s a great smile! Your victory pose is\npicture-perfect, too!
0-mes_tower_tr_096_01	Zoom in on you!
0-mes_tower_tr_096_02	Spot-on focus!
0-mes_tower_tr_096_03	Zoom out, fade...
0-mes_tower_tr_097_01	This camera is pretty hefty, actually.
0-mes_tower_tr_097_02	My shoulder is always rock-hard...\nMy camera’s toughened me up.
0-mes_tower_tr_097_03	Oof... I’m feeling groggy...
0-mes_tower_tr_098_01	Hello there, Trainer! Please battle with me!
0-mes_tower_tr_098_02	Thanks for your help!
0-mes_tower_tr_098_03	I appreciate the lesson!
0-mes_tower_tr_099_01	I’ll do anything for a good news story!
0-mes_tower_tr_099_02	I’m relentless about battling, too!
0-mes_tower_tr_099_03	Stop! Please, stop! You’ll break my mic!
0-mes_tower_tr_100_01	So, the question is, what is your opinion of me?
0-mes_tower_tr_100_02	“What a tough Trainer!” Is that what\nyou’re thinking?
0-mes_tower_tr_100_03	I’m doing a live report on the topic of myself!
0-mes_tower_tr_101_01	Come on! We’ll ride—together!
0-mes_tower_tr_101_02	I beat you!
0-mes_tower_tr_101_03	Wait! Don’t leave me behind!
0-mes_tower_tr_102_01	Gear change! We’re attacking at top speed!
0-mes_tower_tr_102_02	*vrooooom*
0-mes_tower_tr_102_03	*kaboom*
0-mes_tower_tr_103_01	Can you keep up with my Pokémon at full speed?
0-mes_tower_tr_103_02	Too slow!
0-mes_tower_tr_103_03	I’m taking it to a zone beyond speed!
0-mes_tower_tr_104_01	I’d rather cycle casually than go full speed.
0-mes_tower_tr_104_02	Let’s take it easy.
0-mes_tower_tr_104_03	You ought to take things more casually...
0-mes_tower_tr_105_01	I only know how to go at full power,\neven against a younger opponent!
0-mes_tower_tr_105_02	Full power is how I win!
0-mes_tower_tr_105_03	Please! Let me call you Master Trainer from\nnow on!
0-mes_tower_tr_106_01	My spirit burns, my fists are steel, and my\nsweat cascades!
0-mes_tower_tr_106_02	Hrrumph!
0-mes_tower_tr_106_03	I sweated more. That makes me the victor!
0-mes_tower_tr_107_01	En garde!
0-mes_tower_tr_107_02	I’m still ready for more.
0-mes_tower_tr_107_03	Urgh... I won’t forget this!
0-mes_tower_tr_108_01	Hey! Come on!
0-mes_tower_tr_108_02	Nice fight!
0-mes_tower_tr_108_03	You’re not bad, you.
0-mes_tower_tr_109_01	Experience my ultimate technique in its entirety!
0-mes_tower_tr_109_02	I am the greatest! Gwahahaha!
0-mes_tower_tr_109_03	I’ve fallen in defeat? Gw-gwaaah!
0-mes_tower_tr_110_01	Hi, little kid! A battle, please!
0-mes_tower_tr_110_02	Little kid! Thank you very kindly!
0-mes_tower_tr_110_03	Little kid! I’m really upset over this!
0-mes_tower_tr_111_01	I, um... I’ve never actually learned how to\ndo karate.
0-mes_tower_tr_111_02	You’re kidding! I’m naturally talented?!
0-mes_tower_tr_111_03	Black belts are cool, so I just dress up like one.
0-mes_tower_tr_112_01	It’s been five years since I took to the mountains.\nMy hair’s grown wild!
0-mes_tower_tr_112_02	I bathe every day! How dare you?
0-mes_tower_tr_112_03	Another five years...?
0-mes_tower_tr_113_01	Did I catch you smirking at my eight-pack abs?
0-mes_tower_tr_113_02	You don’t appreciate the beauty of pure muscles!
0-mes_tower_tr_113_03	Musculature is the ultimate beauty!
0-mes_tower_tr_114_01	In love and in battles, I’ve never tasted defeat!
0-mes_tower_tr_114_02	See? We won again!
0-mes_tower_tr_114_03	So, I lost. I don’t care! I have a date soon,\nso I don’t care!
0-mes_tower_tr_115_01	This is it! Over the top! Everyone charge!
0-mes_tower_tr_115_02	The enemy Trainer has fallen! Victory is ours!
0-mes_tower_tr_115_03	Retreat! Sound the retreat!
0-mes_tower_tr_116_01	My career as a Trainer dates back 75 years.\nYou think you can win?
0-mes_tower_tr_116_02	Here’s a toast to my history!
0-mes_tower_tr_116_03	My history of glory...
0-mes_tower_tr_117_01	Are you prepared?
0-mes_tower_tr_117_02	Ah, what a superb battle that was.
0-mes_tower_tr_117_03	I tip my hat to you.
0-mes_tower_tr_118_01	Oh, my... Such an adorable Trainer...
0-mes_tower_tr_118_02	Are we disappointed? How adorable...
0-mes_tower_tr_118_03	I see... You’re more than simply adorable.
0-mes_tower_tr_119_01	Eee-yeah!
0-mes_tower_tr_119_02	A stirring shout, wouldn’t you say?\nI find it quite bracing.
0-mes_tower_tr_119_03	*gasp*\nOh dear... I’m worn out.
0-mes_tower_tr_120_01	Being rich doesn’t shield me from having worries.
0-mes_tower_tr_120_02	Of course, being well off is much preferable to\npoverty, but still...
0-mes_tower_tr_120_03	Lavish parties day after day... It gets rather\ntiresome, I must say.
0-mes_tower_tr_121_01	Come to know defeat... Learn what it means\nto battle...
0-mes_tower_tr_121_02	I see you becoming ever more powerful...
0-mes_tower_tr_121_03	The defeated merely slink away...
0-mes_tower_tr_122_01	Look into my eyes!
0-mes_tower_tr_122_02	You fell under my spell!
0-mes_tower_tr_122_03	My power of suggestion failed to charm you!
0-mes_tower_tr_123_01	...
0-mes_tower_tr_123_02	Did it.
0-mes_tower_tr_123_03	I focused my mind in silence...
0-mes_tower_tr_124_01	My powers—there’s no trickery about them!
0-mes_tower_tr_124_02	This is psychic power!
0-mes_tower_tr_124_03	There really is no trickery...
0-mes_tower_tr_125_01	Take it all!
0-mes_tower_tr_125_02	Ahaha!
0-mes_tower_tr_125_03	Gah!
0-mes_tower_tr_126_01	Close your eyes and count... Slow... Slower...
0-mes_tower_tr_126_02	That was the countdown to my victory!
0-mes_tower_tr_126_03	Tch... I thought I could lull you to sleep.
0-mes_tower_tr_127_01	I live among Pokémon.
0-mes_tower_tr_127_02	I’ve never been much of a battler, but...
0-mes_tower_tr_127_03	I’m just not much of a battler.
0-mes_tower_tr_128_01	They’re Pokémon I’ve raised with my father...
0-mes_tower_tr_128_02	Dad, are you seeing this? I did it...
0-mes_tower_tr_128_03	Dad, I can’t... I need to raise them some more...
0-mes_tower_tr_129_01	Raising Pokémon takes a lot of honest effort!
0-mes_tower_tr_129_02	Yahaha! I’ve had a hands-on time raising\nthose Pokémon!
0-mes_tower_tr_129_03	Urgwah! Look what you’ve done to my Pokémon!
0-mes_tower_tr_130_01	Will you have a look at the Pokémon I’ve raised?
0-mes_tower_tr_130_02	Well? Cute, aren’t they?
0-mes_tower_tr_130_03	Cut a girl some slack!
0-mes_tower_tr_131_01	I specialize in raising cute Pokémon!
0-mes_tower_tr_131_02	Cute, yet strong! Right?
0-mes_tower_tr_131_03	Oh, but they’re so cute!
0-mes_tower_tr_132_01	Nice to meet you! Underestimate me at\nyour peril!
0-mes_tower_tr_132_02	Told you!
0-mes_tower_tr_132_03	I guess I underestimated you...
0-mes_tower_tr_133_01	Ahaha... I must say, I like the look in your eyes.
0-mes_tower_tr_133_02	Your eyes remain unclouded in defeat.\nLike jewels, they are!
0-mes_tower_tr_133_03	Your eyes shine brighter than any gemstone I\nkeep at home!
0-mes_tower_tr_134_01	When I was your age, I was quite the daredevil,\nI must say.
0-mes_tower_tr_134_02	Seeing you reminds me of my own wild youth.
0-mes_tower_tr_134_03	I daresay you’re quite the daredevil yourself!
0-mes_tower_tr_135_01	If you want to run home to Mommy, here’s your\nchance, punk!
0-mes_tower_tr_135_02	Geheheh!
0-mes_tower_tr_135_03	Waaah! I want my mommy!
0-mes_tower_tr_136_01	Battles achieve nothing! Take my hand—\nit’s about love!
0-mes_tower_tr_136_02	I didn’t mean to battle—but take my hand!\nIt’s about love!
0-mes_tower_tr_136_03	Battling is futile! Take my hand—it’s about love!
0-mes_tower_tr_137_01	I dropped my glasses. I can’t see straight.
0-mes_tower_tr_137_02	I guess I won. I can’t see enough to tell.
0-mes_tower_tr_137_03	I guess I lost. I can’t see enough to tell.
0-mes_tower_tr_138_01	Slow and steady. You build from the little\nthings up.
0-mes_tower_tr_138_02	Slow and steady is how I won!
0-mes_tower_tr_138_03	But I did things slow and steady...
0-mes_tower_tr_139_01	Hehehehe...
0-mes_tower_tr_139_02	Gehahahaha!
0-mes_tower_tr_139_03	*sob*
0-mes_tower_tr_140_01	Everybody gather around for my stupendicular\nPokémon show!
0-mes_tower_tr_140_02	Wasn’t that amusing?
0-mes_tower_tr_140_03	Nrrgh... I am not amused.
0-mes_tower_tr_141_01	I shall train with you.
0-mes_tower_tr_141_02	Show some spine! On your feet!
0-mes_tower_tr_141_03	Fine! That will do!
0-mes_tower_tr_142_01	Why get all intellectual about things? If it’s fun,\nwhy question it?
0-mes_tower_tr_142_02	See, I can still win. I don’t see a problem!
0-mes_tower_tr_142_03	So I lost. If it’s fun, it’s cool!
0-mes_tower_tr_143_01	I expect you to be good... Don’t you\ndisappoint me!
0-mes_tower_tr_143_02	My hope was misplaced...
0-mes_tower_tr_143_03	You’ve got a good thing going.
0-mes_tower_tr_144_01	My papa and mama are skilled Trainers, too.
0-mes_tower_tr_144_02	It’s in my lineage!
0-mes_tower_tr_144_03	Papa, Mama! I’m so sorry!
0-mes_tower_tr_145_01	I go all out in battle, no matter what.
0-mes_tower_tr_145_02	The inevitable conclusion!
0-mes_tower_tr_145_03	I concede!
0-mes_tower_tr_146_01	This is it—the biggest battle in my life!\nI cannot afford to lose!
0-mes_tower_tr_146_02	Woot, yeah!
0-mes_tower_tr_146_03	This sets me back to being a lass...
0-mes_tower_tr_147_01	My love of nature and Pokémon made a Ranger\nout of me!
0-mes_tower_tr_147_02	I love to battle, too!
0-mes_tower_tr_147_03	Ooh... I still love to battle, too.
0-mes_tower_tr_148_01	Hi! Have you ever considered a career as a\nPokémon Ranger?
0-mes_tower_tr_148_02	Well, you might not make it at your skill level.
0-mes_tower_tr_148_03	Yes, you’ve got the mettle. Being a Pokémon\nRanger is a lot of fun!
0-mes_tower_tr_149_01	Win or lose, a battle happens only once!
0-mes_tower_tr_149_02	Do you have any regrets?
0-mes_tower_tr_149_03	I have no regrets!
0-mes_tower_tr_150_01	It’s my sworn duty to protect nature and the\nPokémon in it.
0-mes_tower_tr_150_02	It’s a challenging life, but there’s a lot to enjoy\nevery day.
0-mes_tower_tr_150_03	It’s a rewarding career. How does it sound\nto you?
0-mes_tower_tr_151_01	My darling Pokémon will lay a licking on you!
0-mes_tower_tr_151_02	Well? Satisfied?
0-mes_tower_tr_151_03	Well, aren’t you tough? I’m a little stunned!
0-mes_tower_tr_152_01	I didn’t sleep while trying to come up with this\nnew strategy!
0-mes_tower_tr_152_02	My strategy worked!
0-mes_tower_tr_152_03	Oh... But I really needed to sleep last night...
0-mes_tower_tr_153_01	The credo of the Dragon Tamer—number one!
0-mes_tower_tr_153_02	In victory, roar! Roar with your dragon!
0-mes_tower_tr_153_03	Even in defeat, roar! Roar with your dragon!
0-mes_tower_tr_154_01	Mighty! Like a dragon!
0-mes_tower_tr_154_02	Strong, I am!
0-mes_tower_tr_154_03	*urf*\nI wanted to be strong...
0-mes_tower_tr_155_01	See it! Feel it! The ultimate power...probably.
0-mes_tower_tr_155_02	There is no defeat for me, the ultimate...\nprobably...
0-mes_tower_tr_155_03	The title of the ultimate...probably... I confer it\non you!
0-mes_tower_tr_156_01	Oh, wow! Rare Pokémon!
0-mes_tower_tr_156_02	Heheheh... That’s what you get for letting down\nyour guard.
0-mes_tower_tr_156_03	Tch. Couldn’t fool you.
0-mes_tower_tr_157_01	I can’t stand getting cold, but I’m quite good.
0-mes_tower_tr_157_02	*ch-chatter*\nWa-wahaha. I won, I won!
0-mes_tower_tr_157_03	*ch-chatter*\nUrr... I’m getting sleepy...
0-mes_tower_tr_158_01	My ace Pokémon are on the go!
0-mes_tower_tr_158_02	You surprise me! Not too shabby!
0-mes_tower_tr_158_03	I like the sense you show!
0-mes_tower_tr_159_01	Snow is wonderful! Everything becomes white.
0-mes_tower_tr_159_02	Snow is so romantic!
0-mes_tower_tr_159_03	I’m whiting out...
0-mes_tower_tr_160_01	Don’t you think this coat is cute? It limits my\nmovements, though.
0-mes_tower_tr_160_02	It’s toasty warm.
0-mes_tower_tr_160_03	I feel snowed under...
0-mes_tower_tr_161_01	I’m the one! Number one out of all the kids\nin shorts!
0-mes_tower_tr_161_02	See? That’s what being number one is about!
0-mes_tower_tr_161_03	Darn... I’m number one...
0-mes_tower_tr_162_01	I’m the one! The only one true one among\nshorts-wearing kids!
0-mes_tower_tr_162_02	See? That’s what being the only one is about!
0-mes_tower_tr_162_03	Darn... I’m the only one...
0-mes_tower_tr_163_01	Um... I’m pleased to meet you.
0-mes_tower_tr_163_02	Awawa... We won?\nUm? S-sorry.
0-mes_tower_tr_163_03	Er, um... Th-thank you...
0-mes_tower_tr_164_01	Here goes!
0-mes_tower_tr_164_02	Bravo!
0-mes_tower_tr_164_03	*yelp*
0-mes_tower_tr_165_01	You will also learn!
0-mes_tower_tr_165_02	The harsh realities of battling!
0-mes_tower_tr_165_03	The joy of victory!
0-mes_tower_tr_166_01	Allow me to study you.
0-mes_tower_tr_166_02	You offered me nothing new to learn.
0-mes_tower_tr_166_03	I get it now. In that situation, I should have used\nthat move.
0-mes_tower_tr_167_01	My teacher gave me advice on battling.
0-mes_tower_tr_167_02	My teacher was right! That was just so easy!
0-mes_tower_tr_167_03	Aww, my teacher was wrong! None of it worked!
0-mes_tower_tr_168_01	Why are we battling? I don’t get it.
0-mes_tower_tr_168_02	Why? I don’t understand.
0-mes_tower_tr_168_03	Why did you win? What happens now?
0-mes_tower_tr_169_01	Ultimately, Pokémon is just another brand.\nYou know who’ll win, right?
0-mes_tower_tr_169_02	I’m not interested in what was an\ninevitable result.
0-mes_tower_tr_169_03	But how... My... The Pokémon I’ve raised...
0-mes_tower_tr_170_01	There isn’t anything that I can’t buy.\nMoney can even buy victory!
0-mes_tower_tr_170_02	There’s nothing that money can’t buy.
0-mes_tower_tr_170_03	I’ll give you my allowance if you’ll let me win.
0-mes_tower_tr_171_01	You know, I’m really not cut out for this\nsocialite-lady thing...
0-mes_tower_tr_171_02	Gahahahah!
0-mes_tower_tr_171_03	You swine! Now I’m steamed!
0-mes_tower_tr_172_01	I’ll be done with you lickety-split!
0-mes_tower_tr_172_02	Lickety-split is how you were done!
0-mes_tower_tr_172_03	Lickety-split is how I’ll excuse myself!
0-mes_tower_tr_173_01	*crunch*\n*crunch*
0-mes_tower_tr_173_02	I love these crunchy Lava Cookies...
0-mes_tower_tr_173_03	So itchy!
0-mes_tower_tr_174_01	The way of the Bug Catcher! Bear witness to it!
0-mes_tower_tr_174_02	This is the way of the Bug Catcher!
0-mes_tower_tr_174_03	All hail Bug Catchers!
0-mes_tower_tr_175_01	Feast your eyes on the secret techniques of the\nancient ones!
0-mes_tower_tr_175_02	See? What did you think? Are you awestruck?
0-mes_tower_tr_175_03	That’s my cue to disappear in a puff of smoke.
0-mes_tower_tr_176_01	I see it!
0-mes_tower_tr_176_02	Think not ill of me...
0-mes_tower_tr_176_03	Gyoeeeh!
0-mes_tower_tr_177_01	Pikaaa!
0-mes_tower_tr_177_02	Pikapikaaah!
0-mes_tower_tr_177_03	Pika pi...
0-mes_tower_tr_178_01	A battle, you say? I’m never losing to you!
0-mes_tower_tr_178_02	Yeehaw! Yippee! I won, I won!
0-mes_tower_tr_178_03	Urk... We lost...
0-mes_tower_tr_179_01	It’s my job to be cute!
0-mes_tower_tr_179_02	Just being cute is money in the bank!
0-mes_tower_tr_179_03	Ugagaah! You rotten thief!
0-mes_tower_tr_180_01	You can shake hands with me! It would be quite\nthe honor for you!
0-mes_tower_tr_180_02	If you’d won, I would have even given you\nmy autograph!
0-mes_tower_tr_180_03	My management team will have something to say\nabout this!
0-mes_tower_tr_181_01	Run! Don’t think! Run!
0-mes_tower_tr_181_02	Faster! More! More! Faster!
0-mes_tower_tr_181_03	Run! Keep running for me!
0-mes_tower_tr_182_01	Hiya. Nice to meet ya.
0-mes_tower_tr_182_02	All right. Nice seeing ya.
0-mes_tower_tr_182_03	All right. Thanks for coming by.
0-mes_tower_tr_183_01	My cohorts call me the emperor of fishing!
0-mes_tower_tr_183_02	I landed another big one today!
0-mes_tower_tr_183_03	Why the emperor of fishing? It’s an\nancient legend...
0-mes_tower_tr_184_01	When you get as good as me, you can win easily,\neven if asleep.
0-mes_tower_tr_184_02	*zzz*
0-mes_tower_tr_184_03	*sssnore*
0-mes_tower_tr_185_01	My mom and I travel around in search of\nlost treasures.
0-mes_tower_tr_185_02	The rest of the time, we fish and tend to crops.
0-mes_tower_tr_185_03	You sure seem to be hectic.
0-mes_tower_tr_186_01	Win! That’s what I’ll do again today!\nI’ll win tomorrow, too!
0-mes_tower_tr_186_02	Nahaha! Nahaha!\nI’m not gonna lose for my whole life!
0-mes_tower_tr_186_03	Nooooo! No way! I didn’t lose!
0-mes_tower_tr_187_01	Allow me to examine your prowess as a collector.
0-mes_tower_tr_187_02	You’re still wanting. I urge you to keep at it.
0-mes_tower_tr_187_03	That’s quite the collection. I’m willing to relieve\nyou of the lot.
0-mes_tower_tr_188_01	Yah, yah, yah!
0-mes_tower_tr_188_02	Yesss!
0-mes_tower_tr_188_03	Owowowoooh!
0-mes_tower_tr_189_01	I want you to hear it! A shout from the heart!
0-mes_tower_tr_189_02	I love music!
0-mes_tower_tr_189_03	Let’s hear it for an encore!
0-mes_tower_tr_190_01	Battle? I’m up for that.
0-mes_tower_tr_190_02	Wow. Good stuff.
0-mes_tower_tr_190_03	Thanks much.
0-mes_tower_tr_191_01	Fwoom!
0-mes_tower_tr_191_02	Flap! Flap!
0-mes_tower_tr_191_03	I’m gonna pluck you for that!
0-mes_tower_tr_192_01	Sure, let’s duke it out!
0-mes_tower_tr_192_02	Let’s battle again!
0-mes_tower_tr_192_03	You’re not half bad!
0-mes_tower_tr_193_01	Looking out over the sea’s breaking waves...\nIt revives memories.
0-mes_tower_tr_193_02	Wroaaaaaar! Daddy!
0-mes_tower_tr_193_03	Wroaaaar! Mommy!
0-mes_tower_tr_194_01	Come on! Take a run at me! I can take it!
0-mes_tower_tr_194_02	So, what’d you think? Was I too burly for you\nto handle?
0-mes_tower_tr_194_03	Good job! Way to overcome my size!
0-mes_tower_tr_195_01	Waah! Wait! Wait a second!\nMy mind’s not into this yet!
0-mes_tower_tr_195_02	Huh? It’s over already? What? I won, you say?
0-mes_tower_tr_195_03	Huh? It’s over already? What? I lost, you say?
0-mes_tower_tr_196_01	My favorite drink is Moomoo Milk. Got some?
0-mes_tower_tr_196_02	Wahaha! I get the win! Let’s celebrate over\nsome Moomoo Milk!
0-mes_tower_tr_196_03	Gwaah! Moomoo Milk! Bring me some\nMoomoo Milk!
0-mes_tower_tr_197_01	Stop right there!
0-mes_tower_tr_197_02	Hah! I’ve still got it.
0-mes_tower_tr_197_03	I can’t believe I let myself down like that!
0-mes_tower_tr_198_01	I’m a uniform collector.
0-mes_tower_tr_198_02	You look like a uniform would suit you.\nYou should try to find one you like.
0-mes_tower_tr_198_03	I must say, battling is a wonderful thing.
0-mes_tower_tr_199_01	Who knows what happens tomorrow?
0-mes_tower_tr_199_02	You can lose one day, and win the next.\nThat’s how it goes.
0-mes_tower_tr_199_03	I might win tomorrow. That’s what I believe.
0-mes_tower_tr_200_01	I’m throwing my all into this match!
0-mes_tower_tr_200_02	Yeah! Yahoo!
0-mes_tower_tr_200_03	It’s over!
0-mes_tower_tr_201_01	The indefatigable camper makes his stand!
0-mes_tower_tr_201_02	You can become a devotee if you’d like.
0-mes_tower_tr_201_03	I wish I could become your devotee.
0-mes_tower_tr_202_01	I don’t think I have any chance of winning,\nbut sure, I’ll battle.
0-mes_tower_tr_202_02	Wow, I wasn’t expecting to win.
0-mes_tower_tr_202_03	I knew I’d lose. I’m so sorry for this.
0-mes_tower_tr_203_01	You’re awfully interested in me, aren’t you?
0-mes_tower_tr_203_02	You lost because you were paying too much\nattention to me.
0-mes_tower_tr_203_03	Why did you win? I thought you liked me.
0-mes_tower_tr_204_01	Win or lose, let’s not bear any grudges.
0-mes_tower_tr_204_02	Yay, yay, yay! We did it!
0-mes_tower_tr_204_03	Oh, you! Don’t ever forget this!
0-mes_tower_tr_205_01	Pokémon are for grown-ups, too.\nLet me show you...
0-mes_tower_tr_205_02	What do you think? Am I deep like an old\nblues man?
0-mes_tower_tr_205_03	Even though that wasn’t fun, I can handle it in a\nmature way.
0-mes_tower_tr_206_01	What I have here isn’t really a guitar.
0-mes_tower_tr_206_02	*beep* *boop* *bzzt*
0-mes_tower_tr_206_03	This here is a keyboard synth.
0-mes_tower_tr_207_01	For work, I sometimes get to be a swimmer or\na beauty.
0-mes_tower_tr_207_02	An idol can become anybody!
0-mes_tower_tr_207_03	But the real me... I’m still a lass in a miniskirt!
0-mes_tower_tr_208_01	Let’s enjoy ourselves. I hate anything to do\nwith pain!
0-mes_tower_tr_208_02	Ooh! That was fun!
0-mes_tower_tr_208_03	Yowch! Watch it! You play too rough!
0-mes_tower_tr_209_01	I’ll put an end to this—with my favorite Pokémon!
0-mes_tower_tr_209_02	The love I have for my Pokémon is complete and\nperfectly strong...
0-mes_tower_tr_209_03	Why? Why?! Why did I lose?!
0-mes_tower_tr_210_01	Living with Pokémon... Every day is the greatest.
0-mes_tower_tr_210_02	Ehehe... Pokémon are the best.
0-mes_tower_tr_210_03	It’s not a problem if I lose. I still have\nmy Pokémon...
0-mes_tower_tr_211_01	I have my Pokémon. I don’t need anything else.
0-mes_tower_tr_211_02	With my Pokémon, I can be happy every day.
0-mes_tower_tr_211_03	Isn’t that the same for you? Isn’t it?
0-mes_tower_tr_212_01	You wouldn’t guess it now, but I was the life of\nthe party in my day.
0-mes_tower_tr_212_02	Well, I still have it now, you know.
0-mes_tower_tr_212_03	I feel nostalgic for those days...
0-mes_tower_tr_213_01	Do your best, my beloved children!
0-mes_tower_tr_213_02	Wahaha! Well done! Papa’s proud of you!
0-mes_tower_tr_213_03	My Pokémon are my beloved family.
0-mes_tower_tr_214_01	Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t matter which.\nLet’s do this!
0-mes_tower_tr_214_02	Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t matter which,\nbut I’m sorry.
0-mes_tower_tr_214_03	Little boy? Little girl? Doesn’t matter which,\nbut you’re sure tough!
0-mes_tower_tr_215_01	Your ride ends here.
0-mes_tower_tr_215_02	Told ya it’s over.
0-mes_tower_tr_215_03	Too much for me to handle!
0-mes_tower_tr_216_01	We’re going for the win! Hey-ho, let’s go!
0-mes_tower_tr_216_02	Yay! Vavavoom!
0-mes_tower_tr_216_03	Aww, we lost...\n*sniffle*
0-mes_tower_tr_217_01	Let me introduce you to my cherished partners!
0-mes_tower_tr_217_02	My cherished partners! How did you find them?
0-mes_tower_tr_217_03	Awawa... My partners...
0-mes_tower_tr_218_01	Winning and losing isn’t all there is to battling.
0-mes_tower_tr_218_02	Well, sure, it makes me happy when I win.
0-mes_tower_tr_218_03	The effort you put in is what’s important.
0-mes_tower_tr_219_01	It’s no good to be too harsh... But pampering is\nalso out.
0-mes_tower_tr_219_02	Being a Pokémon Breeder is a deep and\ncomplex challenge.
0-mes_tower_tr_219_03	Balance is key for raising good Pokémon.
0-mes_tower_tr_220_01	I’ll check how your Pokémon have grown for you.
0-mes_tower_tr_220_02	Not good enough! Your training style’s not up\nto par.
0-mes_tower_tr_220_03	This is impressive! You’ve raised your Pokémon\nreally thoroughly.
0-mes_tower_tr_221_01	I’ll win. No lie.
0-mes_tower_tr_221_02	See?
0-mes_tower_tr_221_03	Huh!
0-mes_tower_tr_222_01	Fwaah! Fwaah! You think you can beat me?
0-mes_tower_tr_222_02	Fwaah! Fwaah! I win!
0-mes_tower_tr_222_03	Fwaah!
0-mes_tower_tr_223_01	I’ve caught you now. Give up.
0-mes_tower_tr_223_02	You weren’t bad. Let’s meet again.
0-mes_tower_tr_223_03	How could this be?
0-mes_tower_tr_224_01	Yo, yo! Let’s have a fun time!
0-mes_tower_tr_224_02	Thank you! Let’s play again!
0-mes_tower_tr_224_03	Thanks! Play with me again!
0-mes_tower_tr_225_01	You’re no good at all. I’d better teach you.
0-mes_tower_tr_225_02	No, no, this won’t do at all. Up on your feet.\nNever give up!
0-mes_tower_tr_225_03	You’ve got good skills. You tried hard, too.\nExcellent!
0-mes_tower_tr_226_01	I’m jacking up the power to max! All the way\nto 11!
0-mes_tower_tr_226_02	Ooh, yeah! I’m feeling electric!
0-mes_tower_tr_226_03	Eeyow! I got zapped!
0-mes_tower_tr_227_01	OK, bring it!
0-mes_tower_tr_227_02	Hah! Too weak! Keep trying!
0-mes_tower_tr_227_03	Hoh! You are tough! Give me a rematch!
0-mes_tower_tr_228_01	You need to be serious with me!
0-mes_tower_tr_228_02	Oh? That’s it?
0-mes_tower_tr_228_03	OK... Quite remarkable.
0-mes_tower_tr_229_01	Ahaha! Too bad for you! I’m your opponent!
0-mes_tower_tr_229_02	Ahaha!
0-mes_tower_tr_229_03	Aha... Ahaha...
0-mes_tower_tr_230_01	Are you nervous? Leave it to the dude!
0-mes_tower_tr_230_02	That was a good battle. I hope we can\nmeet again.
0-mes_tower_tr_230_03	Whew... The dude wasn’t expecting to lose.
0-mes_tower_tr_231_01	The power of nature! Let me show you!
0-mes_tower_tr_231_02	This is the power of nature!
0-mes_tower_tr_231_03	Protect the natural environment...
0-mes_tower_tr_232_01	A battle with me? I don’t know what you’re\ntalking about.
0-mes_tower_tr_232_02	See? I thought this would happen.
0-mes_tower_tr_232_03	Boo! Boo! This is not right!
0-mes_tower_tr_233_01	Fuhahaha! Your next challenge is me!
0-mes_tower_tr_233_02	Fuhahaha! You seriously believed you could\ndefeat me?
0-mes_tower_tr_233_03	Fuhahaha! Let us meet again!
0-mes_tower_tr_234_01	Off you go! Face my team of totally\ntrained Pokémon!
0-mes_tower_tr_234_02	Bravo! I knew my Pokémon would do it!
0-mes_tower_tr_234_03	Oh, no! That’s awful! What have you done to\nmy Pokémon?!
0-mes_tower_tr_235_01	A battle is deadly earnest! We can afford not a\nmoment of inattention!
0-mes_tower_tr_235_02	Never let down your guard!
0-mes_tower_tr_235_03	I seem to have let my mind wander...
0-mes_tower_tr_236_01	Hey!
0-mes_tower_tr_236_02	Heeey!
0-mes_tower_tr_236_03	Hey...
0-mes_tower_tr_237_01	I’m tough, that’s all.
0-mes_tower_tr_237_02	I won, that’s all.
0-mes_tower_tr_237_03	I lost, that’s all.
0-mes_tower_tr_238_01	Shaah!
0-mes_tower_tr_238_02	Hwooh!
0-mes_tower_tr_238_03	Hawah!
0-mes_tower_tr_239_01	I’ve been here for years, but I never get tired\nof this.
0-mes_tower_tr_239_02	You might not think so, but I’m still a kid. I’m in\nthe same grade as you.
0-mes_tower_tr_239_03	I’d like to keep battling with Pokémon even when\nmy hair is gray.
0-mes_tower_tr_240_01	Let me make one thing clear... You aren’t\ncapable of beating me.
0-mes_tower_tr_240_02	Did I not say? There is no possible chance of you\nbeating me.
0-mes_tower_tr_240_03	How could this be? Only that girl with the\ninner tube has beaten me...
0-mes_tower_tr_241_01	Oh, my, a mere child.
0-mes_tower_tr_241_02	Children these days... So careless.
0-mes_tower_tr_241_03	Children these days... Quite exuberant, methinks.
0-mes_tower_tr_242_01	I would like my children to become strong and\ndistinguished Trainers.
0-mes_tower_tr_242_02	It wouldn’t do if my children were only as good\nas you...
0-mes_tower_tr_242_03	It would be nice if they were as skilled as you...
0-mes_tower_tr_243_01	Behold, you shall! Mystifying psychic power!
0-mes_tower_tr_243_02	You see? Mystifying psychic power!
0-mes_tower_tr_243_03	No, but... Mystifying psychic power!
0-mes_tower_tr_244_01	My family will show you a good time!
0-mes_tower_tr_244_02	Hold up, my family! That’ll be enough already!
0-mes_tower_tr_244_03	My beloved family...
0-mes_tower_tr_245_01	Twirl, twirl, twirl...
0-mes_tower_tr_245_02	Are you feeling dizzy?
0-mes_tower_tr_245_03	Ooorgh... My head’s spinning!
0-mes_tower_tr_246_01	My big brother told me... Eyes! Aim for the eyes!
0-mes_tower_tr_246_02	Yay! I did it! My big brother’s plan worked!
0-mes_tower_tr_246_03	My big brother told me to lower the\nfoe’s accuracy!
0-mes_tower_tr_247_01	Hoy! You look pretty tough. This is gonna be fun!
0-mes_tower_tr_247_02	I thought so! You are tough!
0-mes_tower_tr_247_03	Yup, you sure are tough. Keep it up!
0-mes_tower_tr_248_01	Ah, welcome! I’m your server today!
0-mes_tower_tr_248_02	Would you care to settle your bill?
0-mes_tower_tr_248_03	Thank you so much!
0-mes_tower_tr_249_01	Hello. Whatcha having?
0-mes_tower_tr_249_02	Thanks a million!
0-mes_tower_tr_249_03	Be seeing ya!
0-mes_tower_tr_250_01	I love cute customers like you! I’ll serve you right!
0-mes_tower_tr_250_02	Well, were you happy with the way I served you?
0-mes_tower_tr_250_03	Oh, but... I’m not done serving you.
0-mes_tower_tr_251_01	*stare*
0-mes_tower_tr_251_02	You’ve got something on your nose.
0-mes_tower_tr_251_03	You’re cool, all right. I had to stare.
0-mes_tower_tr_252_01	I’ve waited a long time for a Trainer like you to\ncome along.
0-mes_tower_tr_252_02	Yup, you’re as tough as I thought. You even had\nme in trouble!
0-mes_tower_tr_252_03	I knew it! You are a tough Trainer!
0-mes_tower_tr_253_01	Now, how should I conduct this offensive?
0-mes_tower_tr_253_02	Oh, now, I need a better effort out of you\nthan that.
0-mes_tower_tr_253_03	Oh, you’re finished and content? OK, another\ntime then.
0-mes_tower_tr_254_01	My Pokémon have a different taste from the\nusual bunch.
0-mes_tower_tr_254_02	Did you notice the difference? My party has\nrich depth.
0-mes_tower_tr_254_03	Did you notice the difference? My party is\nrefreshingly dry.
0-mes_tower_tr_255_01	Hiya! Tough-looking Trainer, aren’t you!
0-mes_tower_tr_255_02	This feeling of elation is bubbling up in me!
0-mes_tower_tr_255_03	Ooch... You’re too much to handle.
0-mes_tower_tr_256_01	Varrroooom! Watch me go full throttle!
0-mes_tower_tr_256_02	Varrroooom! I’m not close to redlining!
0-mes_tower_tr_256_03	Vrrr... Vrruuu... I’m flat out of gas.
0-mes_tower_tr_257_01	*jingle jingle*
0-mes_tower_tr_257_02	*skreeeech*
0-mes_tower_tr_257_03	*thud*
0-mes_tower_tr_258_01	It’s my dream to cycle with my boyfriend.
0-mes_tower_tr_258_02	No riding double, though!
0-mes_tower_tr_258_03	I wish I had a boyfriend!
0-mes_tower_tr_259_01	What’s your motive? What brought you here?
0-mes_tower_tr_259_02	You lose. Now what will you do?
0-mes_tower_tr_259_03	Play it again.
0-mes_tower_tr_260_01	Let’s keep this match fair and simple.
0-mes_tower_tr_260_02	I admire your technique.
0-mes_tower_tr_260_03	I remain humbled...
0-mes_tower_tr_261_01	You’re serious? A battle? Against me?
0-mes_tower_tr_261_02	*cackle*\nYou shouldn’t have tried!
0-mes_tower_tr_261_03	Double wow!
0-mes_tower_tr_262_01	I’ll dance and sing and rivet your attention!
0-mes_tower_tr_262_02	Ooh, baby!
0-mes_tower_tr_262_03	So much for riveting your attention. My Pokémon\ndidn’t stand a chance!
0-mes_tower_tr_263_01	Ready, start!
0-mes_tower_tr_263_02	First across the finish line!
0-mes_tower_tr_263_03	Waah! Wait for me!
0-mes_tower_tr_264_01	Can you explain why I’m here?
0-mes_tower_tr_264_02	I mean, who are you?
0-mes_tower_tr_264_03	Why am I battling here?
0-mes_tower_tr_265_01	My fishing-rod-handling technique is the best in\nall Sinnoh. Check it out!
0-mes_tower_tr_265_02	See it? Surprised, I bet!
0-mes_tower_tr_265_03	How I handle my fishing rod has nothing to do\nwith battling...
0-mes_tower_tr_266_01	The two loves of my life are fishing and battling.
0-mes_tower_tr_266_02	I feel fantastic when I land a big fish or win a\nbig battle.
0-mes_tower_tr_266_03	I was born to fish and battle!
0-mes_tower_tr_267_01	I came here on a ship. Big ship it was.
0-mes_tower_tr_267_02	Sinnoh, I like. Very nice place.
0-mes_tower_tr_267_03	You want to go to sea? In my ship, we will see\nwonderful things.
0-mes_tower_tr_268_01	Huh? You’re my opponent? This is kind\nof unnerving...
0-mes_tower_tr_268_02	I’m surprised... I didn’t think I’d win.
0-mes_tower_tr_268_03	See, I told you... I thought you were tough.
0-mes_tower_tr_269_01	Hahah! Howdy!
0-mes_tower_tr_269_02	Hahah! Keep it coming!
0-mes_tower_tr_269_03	Thanks for your time!
0-mes_tower_tr_270_01	Let’s be good sports about this! Big smile!
0-mes_tower_tr_270_02	Ahaha! Ahaha! Come on, you laugh, too!
0-mes_tower_tr_270_03	I’m cheerful even in defeat! Ahaha! Ahaha!
0-mes_tower_tr_271_01	Buck up.
0-mes_tower_tr_271_02	Not bad.
0-mes_tower_tr_271_03	You’re good.
0-mes_tower_tr_272_01	The sweetest thing about battling?\nThe finishing blow!
0-mes_tower_tr_272_02	Take that! That’s my finishing move!
0-mes_tower_tr_272_03	Oof... I felt your finishing shot.
0-mes_tower_tr_273_01	Hey, you’re looking nifty!
0-mes_tower_tr_273_02	Hey, you tried, right?
0-mes_tower_tr_273_03	Hey, you’re kind of tough.
0-mes_tower_tr_274_01	Listen! This is my chorus group. Me and\nmy Pokémon!
0-mes_tower_tr_274_02	Shooby-dooby doowop!
0-mes_tower_tr_274_03	Oh, wait! We’re not done singing!
0-mes_tower_tr_275_01	I got tips from my online friends on how to best\nraise my gang.
0-mes_tower_tr_275_02	I must thank my online friends. I don’t know who\nthey are, though.
0-mes_tower_tr_275_03	This is no good! My online buddies let me down!
0-mes_tower_tr_276_01	Can I have a moment? I’m trying to write\nan email.
0-mes_tower_tr_276_02	I need to get home quick and check my email.
0-mes_tower_tr_276_03	What do you think you’re doing? I want to go\nback to my email.
0-mes_tower_tr_277_01	Father... Mother... Please watch over me.
0-mes_tower_tr_277_02	Father... Mother... Were you watching?
0-mes_tower_tr_277_03	Father... Mother... Please forgive me.
0-mes_tower_tr_278_01	Can’t rightly say I much like battling, I tell you.
0-mes_tower_tr_278_02	I won, but...I’m still shaking.
0-mes_tower_tr_278_03	Grr... I’m so angry I could cry.
0-mes_tower_tr_279_01	It’s the power of science!
0-mes_tower_tr_279_02	Did you see? Were you amazed?\nThat’s the power of science!
0-mes_tower_tr_279_03	It’s inconceivable... How could the power of\nscience be defeated?
0-mes_tower_tr_280_01	Charge, my Pokémon! Demonstrate the fruits of\nour experimentation!
0-mes_tower_tr_280_02	Yes, my Pokémon proved my theory! I’ll get my\nprofessorship now!
0-mes_tower_tr_280_03	What kind of experiments? That’s classified.
0-mes_tower_tr_281_01	I shall regress to my childhood for this battle.
0-mes_tower_tr_281_02	Goo-goo ga-ga.
0-mes_tower_tr_281_03	Ga-ga...
0-mes_tower_tr_282_01	Fwahahaha! You’ve come a long way!
0-mes_tower_tr_282_02	Fwahahahaha!
0-mes_tower_tr_282_03	Fwahahaha! You’re blessed to have your friends!
0-mes_tower_tr_283_01	I’ll scrap you.
0-mes_tower_tr_283_02	I’ll recycle you.
0-mes_tower_tr_283_03	Think ecology. Think green.
0-mes_tower_tr_284_01	Why, sure! Sounds great! We have to do this!
0-mes_tower_tr_284_02	Bam! All done!
0-mes_tower_tr_284_03	A battle while working... It’s a good way to take\na break.
0-mes_tower_tr_285_01	I’ll try to do my best! Please give me this chance!
0-mes_tower_tr_285_02	I’ve done it! I’ve achieved my goal!
0-mes_tower_tr_285_03	I tried the best I could! Thank you for\nyour encouragement!
0-mes_tower_tr_286_01	A battle is... It is a love letter written in sand.
0-mes_tower_tr_286_02	Did you understand what I’m trying to say?\nI guess you wouldn’t...
0-mes_tower_tr_286_03	Did you understand what I’m trying to say?\nI guess you wouldn’t...
0-mes_tower_tr_287_01	Hello, you there! Yes, you! Wait up a second, eh?
0-mes_tower_tr_287_02	OK, kids shouldn’t be out at this time. Go on\nhome now, you hear?
0-mes_tower_tr_287_03	That’s quite a Pokémon you have there!
0-mes_tower_tr_288_01	*sssnork* *zzz*
0-mes_tower_tr_288_02	Clefairy... *mumble*\nWait for me... *sssnork*
0-mes_tower_tr_288_03	*mutter*\nEhehe... *ssssnore*
0-mes_tower_tr_289_01	Let’s keep this elegant!
0-mes_tower_tr_289_02	Mmm, yes!
0-mes_tower_tr_289_03	You’re quite the Trainer yourself!
0-mes_tower_tr_290_01	A battle isn’t something you can calculate.
0-mes_tower_tr_290_02	What’d I tell you? You win when you win.
0-mes_tower_tr_290_03	What’d I say, huh? You lose when you lose.
0-mes_tower_tr_291_01	There’s lots in life that doesn’t go the way\nyou want.
0-mes_tower_tr_291_02	Yippee! Things went my way!
0-mes_tower_tr_291_03	See?
0-mes_tower_tr_292_01	There’s nowhere to run or hide!
0-mes_tower_tr_292_02	This was a foregone conclusion!
0-mes_tower_tr_292_03	Farewell!
0-mes_tower_tr_293_01	I wait for tough Trainers here, come rain or shine.
0-mes_tower_tr_293_02	Because of that, I’ve grown so very strong...
0-mes_tower_tr_293_03	Won’t a tough Trainer—\nNo, forget that. I need a cool Trainer to come...
0-mes_tower_tr_294_01	This is for keeping the sun off.
0-mes_tower_tr_294_02	I’m strong at battling, but I can’t take sunlight.
0-mes_tower_tr_294_03	I don’t want to roast my skin.
0-mes_tower_tr_295_01	My, aren’t you an unusual Pokémon?
0-mes_tower_tr_295_02	Hmm, for some reason, I couldn’t catch you.\nSuch an odd Pokémon...
0-mes_tower_tr_295_03	Oh, you’re a Trainer? You’re not a Pokémon?
0-mes_tower_tr_296_01	Ready?
0-mes_tower_tr_296_02	Cool.
0-mes_tower_tr_296_03	Bye.
0-mes_tower_tr_297_01	Beat me? Try again in another 10 years!
0-mes_tower_tr_297_02	No spine!
0-mes_tower_tr_297_03	You’re tough! You inspire me!
0-mes_tower_tr_298_01	Smelling sweet scents makes me so drowsy...
0-mes_tower_tr_298_02	*yawn*\nOh? Are we finished so soon?
0-mes_tower_tr_298_03	*yawn*\nOh, really? I lost?
0-mes_tower_tr_299_01	You’re sure you can handle me? I’m an\nultrastellar talent.
0-mes_tower_tr_299_02	Don’t feel bad! I’m an ultrastellar talent!
0-mes_tower_tr_299_03	You’re in the miracle-star class!
0-mes_tower_tr_300_01	I live only for battles. Only victories give\nme hope.
0-mes_tower_tr_300_02	Naturally.
0-mes_tower_tr_300_03	Who are you?
0-mes_tower_tr_306_01	Now, come! Show me, the Tower Tycoon, what\nyou’re really made of!
0-mes_tower_tr_306_02	A magnificent bout that was! Do come\nvisit again!
0-mes_tower_tr_306_03	Losing to an outstanding Trainer like you...\nI can live with that.
0-mes_tower_tr_307_01	Now, come! Show me, the Tower Tycoon, what\nyou’re really made of!
0-mes_tower_tr_307_02	A magnificent bout that was! Do come\nvisit again!
0-mes_tower_tr_307_03	Losing to an outstanding Trainer like you...\nI can live with that.
1-RIVAL_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_FIRST_DAMAGE	Don’t get cocky, kid! This isn’t over yet!
1-RIVAL_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_HP_HALF	My Pokémon’s HP is low... This could be a\nbit tight.
1-RIVAL_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What just happened? I lost?!
1-LEADER1_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	Think you can take down the next Pokémon like\nyou did the other ones?
1-LEADER1_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	No way! Not yet! Not giving up!
1-LEADER1_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wh-what? That can’t be! My buffed-up Pokémon!
1-TANPAN_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You avoided the long way around? Let’s see why\nyou’d do that!
1-TANPAN_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Now I understand why you decided to battle\nwith me.
1-TANPAN_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You should go whichever way you want—take the\nshortcut or the long way!
1-TANPAN_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Only those who want to win can challenge a\nPokémon Gym!
1-TANPAN_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Gggh... This is humiliating!
1-TANPAN_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	One day, I’m going to become a tough Trainer\nlike you.
1-TANPAN_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You’re a Pokémon Trainer! I happen to be a\nPokémon Trainer!\c\nOur eyes met, so battle we must!
1-TANPAN_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Too strong! Too strong!
1-TANPAN_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Don’t be shy about talking to Trainers you’d like\nto battle. Pokémon grow stronger and stronger\r\nfrom battling.
1-TANPAN_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Did you get better since we met? I... Well, here,\njust look!
1-TANPAN_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Let’s have a Pokémon battle!\nHumph! But I’m gonna win!
1-TANPAN_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re, like, wow!
1-TANPAN_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It’s fun to battle others! I’m gonna battle all sorts\nof people!
1-TANPAN_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Let’s have another Pokémon battle! This time,\nI’m gonna win!
1-MINI_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I spy, with my little eye...a Trainer!\nA battle, please!
1-MINI_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, boo! I can’t win!
1-MINI_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	My Pokémon are all tuckered out! I need to go\nto a Pokémon Center!
1-MINI_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh, hi! I remember you, Trainer!\nA battle, please!
1-TANPAN_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m full of energy because I get power from\nmy Pokémon!
1-TANPAN_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh! My poor Bidoof and Zubat!
1-TANPAN_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Avoid tall grass... Or avoid Trainers...\nDo you have trouble deciding?
1-TANPAN_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	You look familiar, Trainer. Can I have\nanother match?
1-TANPAN_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We’re always together. I’ll show you how\nwe’ve bonded!
1-TANPAN_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	It’s got me down...
1-TANPAN_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I don’t bear grudges over losing. But I promise\nI’ll get tougher!
1-TANPAN_13_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’m always with my Pokémon.\c\nActually, you’re always with your Pokémon too,\naren’t you?
1-TANPAN_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Gimme a battle so I can see if I’m ready for the\nPokémon Gym challenge!
1-TANPAN_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I guess it means I’m not ready for the Gym\nchallenge yet...
1-TANPAN_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I guess if you don’t have a single Gym Badge,\nyou’re a total nobody...
1-TANPAN_14_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’m about to take the Pokémon Gym challenge.\nBut before I go, I wanna spar with you.
1-MINI_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from the\nGym Leader in Oreburgh City!
1-MINI_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, I lost! Lalala!
1-MINI_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m going to collect lots of Gym Badges! I’ll work\nwith my Pokémon!
1-MINI_07_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I got a nifty-keen Gym Badge from the Gym\nLeader in Oreburgh City!\c\n...Did I show you already?
1-MINI_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I found a Trainer while looking for\nsome Pokémon!
1-MINI_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hunh? You’re finished so soon?
1-MINI_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I walk through tall grass until I find the Pokémon\nI want.
1-MINI_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I found a familiar-looking Trainer!
1-MINI_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Oh, a weak-looking Trainer... Do you want to\nhave a go?
1-MINI_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Aww... I shouldn’t have battled in the first place.
1-MINI_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I didn’t know you were so tough... I’m going to\ntrain harder, too!
1-MINI_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hi, pretty-tough Trainer! Will you give me\na rematch?
1-TANPAN_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My dad gave me some Pokémon! They’re gonna\nwin for me!
1-TANPAN_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	But they’re Pokémon I got from my dad...
1-TANPAN_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Who gave you your first Pokémon?\c\nYour first Pokémon is the one with the most\nfond memories, I think.
1-TANPAN_05_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’m gonna win this time with the Pokémon I got\nfrom my dad!
1-MINI_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	May I please trouble you for a battle?
1-MINI_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh... You’re so strong...
1-MINI_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Maybe I could have won if my Pokémon was\nholding a Berry.
1-MINI_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh, thank you for that last battle.\c\nMay I please trouble you for another one?
1-MUSHI_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Say, what’s your opinion on bug Pokémon?
1-MUSHI_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m not going to be able to explain the charms of\nbug Pokémon this way!
1-MUSHI_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Bug Pokémon grow quickly, and they do stuff like\npoison and paralyze, and they’re cute and cool.\c\nYou gotta believe me—they’re good!
1-MUSHI_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	So, listen. Tell me you’ve grown to like bug\nPokémon since we last met.
1-AROMA_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Let’s have a battle while smelling the aroma\nof flowers!
1-AROMA_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Even though I lost, I’m not angry because it\nsmells so nice.
1-AROMA_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Maybe my Pokémon will get scouted at the TV\nstation in Jubilife City.
1-AROMA_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	You came back to me because you couldn’t\nforget the smell of flowers!
1-FUTAGO_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_1	We can one-shot this Trainer, can’t we, Liz?
1-FUTAGO_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_1	Oh, oh, oh?
1-FUTAGO_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_1	Aww! That is so bad!
1-FUTAGO_01_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_1	You only have one Pokémon? That’s so boring!
1-FUTAGO_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START_1	Oh! You’re that Trainer! Let’s get payback, Liz!
1-FUTAGO_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_2	We’re the strongest in our class!
1-FUTAGO_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_2	Oh, but, wait!
1-FUTAGO_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_2	I wish I could be strong like you when I\nget bigger.
1-FUTAGO_01_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_2	Um, will you battle with us? Me and Liv?
1-FUTAGO_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START_2	We’re the best in our class. We can’t be losers\nall the time!
1-CAMPB_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	How about a quick battle before I leave for\nEterna Forest?
1-CAMPB_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That really dampened my spirits.
1-CAMPB_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	They say there are rough Pokémon in\nEterna Forest.\c\nI’d better be more prepared than this.
1-CAMPB_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	You’ve been to Eterna Forest already, right?\nHow was it?
1-CAMPB_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	It’s a long way between Floaroma Town and\nEterna City. So, let’s battle!
1-CAMPB_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wawawaah! I’m out of Pokémon that can battle!
1-CAMPB_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	With my Pokémon by my side, I’m sure any\ncamping will be a blast!
1-CAMPB_12_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	While I was enjoying camping, my Pokémon got\nall big and buffed up!
1-PICNICG_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	What kinds of Pokémon live around here,\nI wonder.
1-PICNICG_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m shocked! How did I lose?
1-PICNICG_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	What can I tell you about Pokémon?\c\nWell, there are males and females. And some\nthat you can’t tell.
1-PICNICG_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh, hi! We meet again! Have you seen any\nrare Pokémon?
1-PICNICG_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Oh, I don’t know. Should I play a little?
1-PICNICG_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, boo! How insulting!
1-PICNICG_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Listen very closely...\nCan you hear the cries of Pokémon?
1-PICNICG_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh, I don’t know. Should I play a little again?
1-MOUNT_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	There’s no mountain here, but I’m dressed to\nhike! Gahaha! Here goes!
1-MOUNT_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, yeah! A refreshing battle that was!
1-MOUNT_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You can find the same kinds of Pokémon in all\nsorts of places.\c\nThere’s no law saying a hiker can’t go searching\nwherever they please!
1-MOUNT_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	If you meet someone in the mountains, they’re\nno longer strangers.\c\nMeet them twice—they’re your friend!
1-MOUNT_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Of all places possible, I’ve lost my way here.
1-MOUNT_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Having lost his way, the Trainer lost the\nbattle, too.
1-MOUNT_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	From being lost in the mountains so long, I\nbecame a hiker.
1-MOUNT_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’ve lost my way again. I’m betrayed by my sense\nof direction.
1-BATTLEG_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hey! I’m not trained to hold back!
1-BATTLEG_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I...I concede! You’re in a different class...
1-BATTLEG_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You taught me how I measure up! Thank you!
1-BATTLEG_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hey! This time, I’m fully committed!
1-AROMA_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I love Pokémon that smell sweet. Like this\none—get a whiff of this!
1-AROMA_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Did you understand what I meant? Didn’t my\nPokémon smell nice?
1-AROMA_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If you plant lots of Berries, you can be\nsurrounded by sweet scents.
1-AROMA_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	*sniff*\nOh? Your Pokémon smells nice!
1-FISHING_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Nothing’s biting, so I could use a break,\nI suppose.
1-FISHING_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, well. I should’ve been a little more serious\nabout this.
1-FISHING_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	!\c\nYank your fishing rod when that appears.\nThat’s how you fish.
1-FISHING_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	All right! I caught some tough Pokémon. I’m\nready for battle!
1-FISHING_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I landed myself a feisty Trainer! Let’s go!
1-FISHING_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I let a big win slip away...
1-FISHING_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Do you have a fishing rod? Catch some big ones!
1-FISHING_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hey, you feisty tyke! I caught me a big one!\nLet’s battle again!
1-FISHING_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I fished up some tough Pokémon! Let’s have\nourselves a battle!
1-FISHING_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Losing has my emotions all knotted up!
1-FISHING_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	My feet are tangled, too! Ouch! Ouch!
1-FISHING_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’m going to win this time! I said I’ll win, and I\nmean it!
1-CYCLINGM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Yo! Having a good time cycling?
1-CYCLINGM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hey, not bad, you!
1-CYCLINGM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Cycling Road’s teeming with Pokémon\nTrainers, too!
1-CYCLINGM_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’m sure I’ve seen your face before. Did we\nmaybe battle?
1-CYCLINGM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hey! Watch where you’re going! Or did you want\nto challenge me?
1-CYCLINGM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My efforts were meaningless...
1-CYCLINGM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I might try racing through Cycling Road in one\nlong shot.
1-CYCLINGM_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	There you are!\c\nI’ve been riding in this spot so I’d get a rematch\nwith you!
1-CYCLINGM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Your bike is the type that can shift gears, huh?\c\nLet me see if you know how to ride it properly.
1-CYCLINGM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I crashed...
1-CYCLINGM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Huh? I was supposed to be checking if you know\nhow to shift gears. Why am I checking out\r\nyour Pokémon?
1-CYCLINGM_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Let me see if you’ve learned how to ride your\nbike properly...\c\nin battle!
1-CYCLINGM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	The bicycle can only take you as far as your\nenergy will allow.
1-CYCLINGM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	*gasp*
1-CYCLINGM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	My Pokémon is out of gas. So am I.\c\nI’m going to head home soon.
1-CYCLINGM_04_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I got plenty of rest at home. I’m not losing\nthis time!
1-CYCLINGW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I worked up a good sweat riding! I’m feeling\ngreat! Let’s battle!
1-CYCLINGW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Whew! You worked us over.
1-CYCLINGW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Do you find yourself pedaling backward\nwhile going downhill?
1-CYCLINGW_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I worked up a good sweat riding! I feel ready for\na rematch!
1-CYCLINGW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You and I, we’re both riding bikes.\c\nAnd you’ve got Pokémon. I don’t want to lose\nto you!
1-CYCLINGW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, geez, I seem to have fallen off my bike.
1-CYCLINGW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Instead of a battle, I should’ve challenged you\nto a bike race!
1-CYCLINGW_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I hate knowing you’ve beaten me. This time, I’m\ngoing to win!
1-CYCLINGW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I love my bike!\c\nBut I’m not very good at fixing flat tires.
1-CYCLINGW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Total wipeout!
1-CYCLINGW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I admire people who understand gadgets.\c\nI’m clueless about how my Pokétch works.
1-CYCLINGW_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I want to practice repairing flat tires...\c\nBut I’ve been practicing with my Pokémon to get\nour revenge!
1-CYCLINGW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Some people compete over speed, and some\ncompete over technique.\c\nWhich kind are you?
1-CYCLINGW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re a speedy technician!
1-CYCLINGW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I enjoy the scenery.\c\nDon’t you think the area below Cycling Road\nlooks nice?
1-CYCLINGW_04_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I polished up both my speed and techniques.\nCan you beat me now?
1-MOUNT_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Whoa! You startled me! Well, we may as\nwell battle!
1-MOUNT_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your power startles me!
1-MOUNT_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	We hikers are bighearted guys! Losing doesn’t\nbother us!
1-MOUNT_10_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Whoa! You startled me! We may as well have\na rematch!
1-TANPAN_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I wear shorts the whole year! I’ve got energy\nto burn!
1-TANPAN_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Having lots of energy isn’t good enough.
1-TANPAN_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	My Pokémon don’t wear anything. I worry that\nthey’ll be cold.
1-TANPAN_06_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I wear shorts! I have lots of energy! I’m not losing\nto you!
1-CAMPB_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Go for it, my Pokémon! I’ll do my best, too!
1-CAMPB_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh...we lost.
1-CAMPB_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Did you know? You can dig up Fossils in the\nGrand Underground!\c\nThose Fossils can be turned back into Pokémon\nat the mining museum!
1-CAMPB_04_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Go for it, my Pokémon! I’ll do more than my best\nthis time!
1-PICNICG_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Go do it, my Pokémon! I’ll work hard, too!
1-PICNICG_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh...we lost.
1-PICNICG_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I think we’ll go visit the TV station in\nJubilife City next.
1-PICNICG_04_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Umm...you’re the Trainer who beat us before,\naren’t you?\c\nWe’re feeling good today, so let’s have\nanother battle!
1-MOUNT_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Wahaha! Laughter brings good fortune!
1-MOUNT_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wahahaha! There’s nothing that I can do\nbut laugh!
1-MOUNT_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Wahaha! Go ahead and laugh at me!
1-MOUNT_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Wahaha!\c\nLaughter brings good fortune! Forgetting your\ngloves brings a cold!
1-MOUNT_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I just got through Mount Coronet, but we’ve still\ngot fuel in the tank!
1-MOUNT_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Whoops! Didn’t take much to beat us!
1-MOUNT_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	We need to rest up in Oreburgh City before\nheading to Mount Coronet again.
1-MOUNT_04_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I just got through Mount Coronet, and who do\nI see? A Trainer who we’ve battled before!
1-BATTLEG_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	OK, OK! Let’s be quick about this!
1-BATTLEG_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	No way! Give us another battle!\n...Oh, right. I’m out of Pokémon.
1-BATTLEG_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Yup! I like the way you battle.
1-BATTLEG_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	What took you so long? We’ve waited here a\nlong time for a rematch with you!
1-MOUNT_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Gahahaha! You’re just a little kid!\c\nHow’re you supposed to beat a big man like me?
1-MOUNT_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m a grown-up, but I got served by some\nlittle kid!
1-MOUNT_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Wow, you’re sure impressive!\c\nI guess it makes no difference if you’re young or\nold in Pokémon battles.
1-MOUNT_05_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hey, you, tough little kid! Throw us a rematch,\nwill you?
1-MOUNT_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	They call me the Echo Man! Battle with me!\nYahoo!
1-MOUNT_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Ohh...yo...yodelay...
1-MOUNT_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Let the Echo Man give you a good word\nof advice!\c\nIf you don’t know where you should be going,\ncheck the Town Map.
1-MOUNT_06_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh, hi there! Remember us? I’m the Echo Man!\c\nLet’s have another battle! Yahoo!
1-MOUNT_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	If I beat you, will you share some food with me?
1-MOUNT_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	We were starved for food, and now we’re starved\nfor a win.
1-MOUNT_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	*sigh* I feel even hungrier. Maybe I’ll chow down\nsome Berries.\c\nBut should I really eat Berries? What am I,\na Pokémon?
1-MOUNT_07_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I, uh, chowed down my packed lunch before we\nstarted climbing.\c\nIf I beat you this time, share some food with me!
1-KARATE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	This karate man will pulverize you!
1-KARATE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I still lack power.
1-KARATE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I need to work out more. My Pokémon does, too!
1-KARATE_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	This karate man hasn’t forgotten being\npulverized by you!
1-FISHING_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Eee-hee-hee! I’ll haul you up and out!
1-FISHING_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My favorite word is “restraint.” Especially\nin battle.
1-FISHING_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You need a Good Rod if you want to catch\ngood Pokémon.
1-FISHING_04_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Eee-hee-hee! There won’t be any restraint this\ntime, OK?
1-AROMA_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Oh, you want to have a battle?\c\nI was meaning to enter a Super Contest Show,\nbut beating you won’t take long.
1-AROMA_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, you have us beaten.
1-AROMA_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You and your Pokémon have so much energy.\c\nI think you would do well in Super Contest\nShows, too.
1-AROMA_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh, didn’t we meet before?\c\nI was meaning to enter a Super Contest Show,\nbut let’s have a quick battle first.
1-ARTIST_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You and I!\c\nLet us create a scene—a fantastic tableau\nof battle!
1-ARTIST_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Magnificent! I am aglow with inspiration!
1-ARTIST_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	That battle will surely become a stupendous\nmasterpiece painting!\c\nI shall title it...\c\n“Pokémon Can Win!”
1-ARTIST_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	The key to becoming a good painter is to\nbe observant.\c\nThe same can be said for battling—one must\nbe observant!
1-BREEDERM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Let me see how much you’ve raised\nyour Pokémon.
1-BREEDERM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Good stuff! Your Pokémon are in\nimpeccable condition.
1-BREEDERM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It’s obvious you raise your Pokémon with a lot\nof love.
1-BREEDERM_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’ve raised my Pokémon since we met. How much\nhave you raised yours?
1-BREEDERW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Listen, if you don’t mind, I’d like to have a battle\nwith your Pokémon.
1-BREEDERW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	*giggle* They’re raised with a lot of care!
1-BREEDERW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If you treat your Pokémon with care, they’ll\nreward you with friendship and loyalty.
1-BREEDERW_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I don’t want to ever battle with people who don’t\ntreat Pokémon nicely!\c\nBut I know you treat yours kindly. I’ll battle\nyou anytime!
1-COWGIRL_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hi, there! Where’re you from? What kinds of\nPokémon have you got?
1-COWGIRL_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Fancy folks like you have fancy Pokémon too,\nit looks like.
1-COWGIRL_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I hope my pa didn’t spy me slacking off from\nwork here.
1-COWGIRL_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh, howdy! Come visiting again? What kinds of\nPokémon’d you bring?
1-JOGGER_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I jog every morning to keep my Pokémon fit.
1-JOGGER_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oops! You threw off my running rhythm.
1-JOGGER_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Being healthy is number one! Why don’t you\ncome running with me?
1-JOGGER_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_NONE_DN	Do you jog every morning, too?
1-JOGGER_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	When I go on my jogs, I pass by lots of people.\c\nI have trouble remembering faces, but we did\nmeet before, right?
1-POKEGIRL_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hi, hi! I’m a Pokémon!
1-POKEGIRL_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m so angry...
1-POKEGIRL_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I want to be a Pokémon when I grow up!
1-POKEGIRL_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hi, hi! I’m a Pokémon!\c\nI think you already know, but we’re going to\nbattle again!
1-LOVELOVE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_1	You’re not supposed to intrude on my time\nwith Sue!
1-LOVELOVE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_1	I only have eyes for Sue. Maybe that’s why\nwe lost?
1-LOVELOVE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_1	Sue, even in defeat, you’re so beautiful!
1-LOVELOVE_01_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_1	I don’t want to do anything without Sue...\c\nBring two Pokémon at least, OK?
1-LOVELOVE_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START_1	Did you come back to intrude on my time\nwith Sue?
1-LOVELOVE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_2	Huh? You want to battle with me?\c\nI will if I can team with Ty!
1-LOVELOVE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_2	I’m sorry, Ty!
1-LOVELOVE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_2	We lost. Ty, I need a hug to make it all better!
1-LOVELOVE_01_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_2	I only want to do things with Ty!\c\nDon’t you have two Pokémon?
1-LOVELOVE_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START_2	Oh, it’s you again! I’ll battle if I can team with Ty!
1-JOGGER_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Jogging is about rhythm. Battling is about\nrhythm, too!
1-JOGGER_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	In a sense, I suppose that was a finish line\nof sorts.
1-JOGGER_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	When your rhythm gets thrown off, everything\nseems out of whack.
1-JOGGER_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_NONE_DN	When I was jogging the other day, a wild\nPokémon came after me.\c\nI ran so fast, I was on top of the waves, I swear.
1-JOGGER_06_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Jogging is about rhythm. Battling is about\nrhythm, too. Our rematch is also about rhythm!
1-FUTAGO_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_1	We battle together! That’s why we’re tough!
1-FUTAGO_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_1	Waaah!
1-FUTAGO_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_1	You’re awesome! Are you maybe a\nPokémon genius?
1-FUTAGO_03_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_1	We won’t play with you if you don’t have\ntwo Pokémon!
1-FUTAGO_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START_1	When I battle with Lil, we shouldn’t lose!
1-FUTAGO_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_2	We’re gonna crunch and munch you all up!
1-FUTAGO_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_2	Hwaaah!
1-FUTAGO_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_2	We’re going to be tough Trainers, too!\nWe decided!
1-FUTAGO_03_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_2	Only one Pokémon is too lonesome!
1-FUTAGO_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START_2	You munched us all up last time—but it’s our\nturn now!
1-BREEDERM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hey, check this out! Look at the luster of my\nPokémon’s fur!
1-BREEDERM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hey, hey, did you take a good look?
1-BREEDERM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Every day, I brush my Pokémon a hundred\nstrokes. Then, I do me.
1-BREEDERM_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I brushed my party a lot. So we’d be ready for\na rematch!
1-BREEDERW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m a rookie breeder, but I’ll do my very best!
1-BREEDERW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	It’s all right! I’m still a rookie!
1-BREEDERW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	How to raise Pokémon? Umm...it’s all about\nlove, right?
1-BREEDERW_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I can’t be a rookie forever. I’ve learned a lot\nsince we last met.
1-FUTAGO_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_1	Yay! We’re gonna battle with lots of Pokémon!
1-FUTAGO_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_1	Even with both of us, we lost.
1-FUTAGO_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_1	Our mommy is a twin, too.
1-FUTAGO_02_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_1	We want to battle with lots of Pokémon.
1-FUTAGO_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START_1	Yay! We’re gonna battle with lots of\nPokémon again!
1-FUTAGO_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_2	Yay! We’re gonna have a battle with\nthree Trainers!
1-FUTAGO_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_2	We two couldn’t win.
1-FUTAGO_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_2	When Mommy and Aunty and me and Teri get\ntogether, it’s really confusing and fun!
1-FUTAGO_02_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_2	We want to have a battle with four Pokémon.
1-FUTAGO_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START_2	Yay! We’re gonna have another battle with\nthree Trainers!
1-FARMER_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My Pokémon toughened up from working on\nthe ranch.\c\nI’m right proud of them!
1-FARMER_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hahahah! Your Pokémon sure can be counted on!
1-FARMER_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	When I touch my Pokémon, I can feel not just\ntheir bodies’ warmth, but their compassion.
1-FARMER_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Howdy! You’re that tough little Trainer!\nI remember you!\c\nCheck out my farm-toughened Pokémon! They’re\nmy pride and joy!
1-JOGGER_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m warmed up and limber. I’m OK to battle!
1-JOGGER_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Um... I wasn’t emotionally ready.
1-JOGGER_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Actually, I wanted to make a run for it.\nThat’s a joke.
1-JOGGER_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_NONE_DN	I’m going to keep running. Just as long as there’s\na road...
1-JOGGER_04_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’ve been training so I can have a rematch\nwith you.\c\nI’m OK to battle!
1-FAMILY_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_1	Uhohoho! I’ll show y’all how tightly I’ve bonded\nwith my daughter!
1-FAMILY_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_1	Parent-and-child power couldn’t get the\njob done.
1-FAMILY_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_1	I reckon the bonds between you and your\nPokémon are like the bonds parents share with\r\ntheir kids.
1-FAMILY_01_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_1	Oh, there’s no way you could beat us both with\none Pokémon.
1-FAMILY_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START_1	Ayuh? You’re here to check the bond I have with\nmy daughter again?
1-FAMILY_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_2	I can get away with slacking off if I have my\nPokémon out!
1-FAMILY_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_2	Oh, sheesh!
1-FAMILY_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_2	Papa, I’m sorry! I promise I’ll work harder\nstarting tomorrow!
1-FAMILY_01_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_2	You’re battling me and my pa. One Pokémon\nwon’t cut it, dear!
1-FAMILY_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START_2	Oh, hi! It’s good y’all came calling on us again!\c\nI can take a break from work if I’m battling\nPokémon. Lucky for me!
1-SHINOBI_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered\nmeans I must battle!
1-SHINOBI_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I concede defeat.
1-SHINOBI_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	My cover is blown, so what should I do?\c\nMaybe I’ll go catch some Super Contest Shows\nin Hearthome City. Maybe I’ll do that.
1-SHINOBI_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Do you remember me? I’m one of the Ninja Trio!\nBeing discovered means I must battle!
1-SHINOBI_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered\nmeans I must battle!
1-SHINOBI_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I concede defeat.
1-SHINOBI_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	While I hid in the tall grass, I sensed Pokémon all\naround me!\c\nFurtive sounds of movement...stifled cries...\nI heard them!
1-SHINOBI_09_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	You don’t remember me? I’m one of the Ninja\nTrio! Being discovered means I must battle!
1-SHINOBI_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m one of the Ninja Trio! Being discovered\nmeans I must battle!\c\nBut how did you discover me? Don’t tell me\nyou’re a ninja, too!
1-SHINOBI_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I concede defeat.
1-SHINOBI_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	A Pokémon Trainer’s good at finding stuff,\nI guess.
1-SHINOBI_10_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	You should join us so we can form the\nNinja Quartet!\c\nAnyway, let’s battle!
1-ELITEM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You seem to have a lot of confidence. Let’s see\nif it’s justified!
1-ELITEM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Haha! A total loss for me!
1-ELITEM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You seem to have an abundance of talent.\nIt’s pretty amazing.
1-ELITEM_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	When I lost to you last time, I was just unlucky.
1-ELITEW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	As an Ace Trainer, I have to take battles in stride.\c\nI need to stay cool and calm whether I win\nor lose.
1-ELITEW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Aiyeeeeh! We lost!
1-ELITEW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	How dare you beat us! Go away! Go!
1-ELITEW_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Last time, I got a little emotional over losing...\c\nI’ll stay cool and calm today!
1-VETERAN_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Me, lose to someone so young? I daresay not!
1-VETERAN_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The power of youth... It’s startling.
1-VETERAN_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Somehow, it makes me happy seeing a young,\nyet surefooted, Trainer such as yourself.
1-VETERAN_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	The power of youth and the technique of\nthe Veteran...\c\nLet us battle again to see which shall prevail!
1-KARATE_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	This buff physique isn’t just for show!
1-KARATE_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Ugwaaaah!
1-KARATE_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Why? Is it because my training wasn’t enough?!
1-KARATE_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	My buff physique! Feast your eyes on it again!
1-SHINOBI_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I just startled you!\c\nWhile you’re still struggling to recover, I’ll\nalready be the winner!
1-SHINOBI_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What’s with you? You didn’t give me\nany openings!
1-SHINOBI_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I need a better reaction out of you. I feel silly\nhiding for so long!
1-SHINOBI_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	You just saw me, and I bet you thought,\n“Long time no see.”\c\nWhile you’re still thinking that, I’ll already be\nthe winner!
1-SHINOBI_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We ninjas appear where you least expect us!
1-SHINOBI_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I didn’t expect to lose.
1-SHINOBI_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	When I hide out like this, I think about what it\nmust be like for Pokémon inside their Poké Balls.
1-SHINOBI_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Wah! Another chance encounter with a foe who\ndefeated me before!
1-SHINOBI_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	A ninja can use all sorts of cool techniques!
1-SHINOBI_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hmm...my ninja techniques failed to work.
1-SHINOBI_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	There’s a ninja Gym Leader somewhere\nfar away.\c\nI should become a devotee of theirs.
1-SHINOBI_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	What’s with you? You’re not a ninja yet?
1-DRAGON_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Don’t be shocked when you see my Pokémon!
1-DRAGON_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh... My... Gosh...
1-DRAGON_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Dragon Pokémon are usually much more powerful\nthan this!
1-DRAGON_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	You again?\c\nYou must really like that dragon Pokémon I use.
1-BIRD_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ll teach you about the charms of bird Pokémon!
1-BIRD_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wow. I admit, I’m quite surprised.
1-BIRD_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The sight of you battling... It was simply a\nwonder to watch!
1-BIRD_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Do you finally understand the appeal of\nbird Pokémon?
1-DOUBLETEAM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_1	Jen, watch this! I’m going to use everything\nyou’ve taught me!
1-DOUBLETEAM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_1	Wow. Someone that’s even better than Jen...
1-DOUBLETEAM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_1	I don’t care if I get to meet the greatest Trainer\nin the region. I’d still rather learn from Jen.
1-DOUBLETEAM_01_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_1	Wouldn’t you rather battle with the two of us?
1-DOUBLETEAM_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START_1	This time, I’m not gonna let you down, Jen!\nI promise!
1-DOUBLETEAM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_2	Here comes a Trainer. Zac, you ready?\nLet’s do this!
1-DOUBLETEAM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_2	I just got embarrassed in front of my little\nbuddy here...
1-DOUBLETEAM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_2	Zac, I’m so sorry. I’m a failure as your instructor.
1-DOUBLETEAM_01_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_2	Would you like to have a two-on-two Pokémon\nbattle with us?
1-DOUBLETEAM_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START_2	Here comes our Trainer! Are you ready this time?
1-BIRD_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Look at these beautiful wings!
1-BIRD_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, you! I’m going to peck you for that!
1-BIRD_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	How come bird Pokémon have such\nbeautiful feathers?\c\nHold one up to the sun and you can see so many\ncolors in it.
1-BIRD_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	My bird Pokémon has such gorgeous wings.\c\nIt must have been some sort of a mistake that we\nlost last time!
1-SHINOBI_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	“Zubat!” Doesn’t that sound like a ninja bursting\nfrom cover?
1-SHINOBI_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh! My Zubat tri-stars...
1-SHINOBI_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Sowing confusion among foes is one way a\nninja battles.\c\nA confused Pokémon can’t show its full power!
1-SHINOBI_04_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	The shinobi live by speed! I’ll get in my attacks\nbefore you!
1-MOUNT_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	See how Mount Coronet towers above us. I want\nto be big like that one day!
1-MOUNT_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	A powerful presence towers before me—it’s you!
1-MOUNT_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Mount Coronet has long been known as an\nancient and mysterious mountain.
1-MOUNT_09_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hmm?! You tower before me again?\c\nIt’s as if you’re Mount Coronet!
1-KARATE_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hah! Hah! I’m psyched for this! Here goes!
1-KARATE_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I don’t get why we can’t win.
1-KARATE_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I guess I ought to study winning techniques for\na change.
1-KARATE_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hah! Hah! This time, I’m psyched up!
1-SHINOBI_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Speed is a ninja’s best weapon! Can you\nkeep up?
1-SHINOBI_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I did a lot to conceal myself, too.
1-SHINOBI_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ll wait here for a weaker-looking Trainer and\nthen ambush them!
1-SHINOBI_05_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I became even faster! How can you hope to\nkeep up?
1-BIRD_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I go everywhere with my Noctowl. We’re gonna\nshow you owl best! Ha!
1-BIRD_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	We did our best. That’s what matters. Right?
1-BIRD_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Even on cold days, just being with my Noctowl\nkeeps me warm!
1-BIRD_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I curled up inside my Noctowl’s wings and waited\nfor you to return!
1-ISEKI_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Whilst exploring the ruins, I spotted a Trainer!\nI must investigate!
1-ISEKI_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My investigation revealed the Trainer to\nbe tough!
1-ISEKI_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Celestic Town is an old town. I’m sure to find\nsomething cool.
1-ISEKI_07_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Whilst exploring the ruins, I spotted you again!\nI will now investigate!
1-PRINCE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ll have you know my Pokémon sleeps on a fancy\nimported bed.
1-PRINCE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Humph! There’s an unseemly sense of\ndesperation about you. Ugh!
1-PRINCE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Oh, my poor little battler is all tuckered out...\c\nI’ll let it sleep in that bed I had sent\nfrom overseas.
1-PRINCE_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I do this only because I love my Pokémon.\nWinning isn’t that important.
1-PRINCESS_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’d like to begin now. Are you quite prepared?
1-PRINCESS_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, how very impressive of you.
1-PRINCESS_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Would you care to inform me of who the amazing\ntutor you’ve hired for your Pokémon is?
1-PRINCESS_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh, I’m delighted to see you again.\nAre you prepared?
1-GENTLE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	If it pleases you, would you care for a Pokémon\nbattle with me?
1-GENTLE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your handling of Pokémon is impeccable.
1-GENTLE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Bahaha! I was invited by the master of the\nPokémon Mansion.
1-GENTLE_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	If it pleases you, would you care for a rematch\nwith me?
1-MADAM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve never battled a young Trainer like you\nbefore. I’m quite nervous!
1-MADAM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, dear... That wasn’t anything like battling\nwith my friends.
1-MADAM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Usually, I’ll have matches with members of my\nsocial club.
1-MADAM_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh, it’s you again, dear?\c\nIt makes me a little nervous, but may I have\na rematch?
1-POLICE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Good evening, Trainer! Fancy a quick nighttime\nPokémon battle?
1-POLICE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’ve got tough partners with you. Carry on,\nTrainer. Carry on.
1-POLICE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Out so late? Does your mother know you’re out\nat this hour?
1-POLICE_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_NONE_D	Why, hello there!\c\nIt’s always nice when a Trainer stops and says hi\nto us police officers!
1-POLICE_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Good evening, Trainer! Now let’s see how our\nPokémon greet each other—in battle!
1-POLICE_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I was just wondering whether my Pokémon would\nhave a chance to battle tonight.
1-POLICE_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I guess I need to train my Pokémon some more.
1-POLICE_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	More Pokémon training is always better.
1-POLICE_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_NONE_D	Patrolling night and day sure is exhausting.\n*yawn*
1-POLICE_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	What a pleasant, quiet evening.\c\nLet’s give our Pokémon some exercise!
1-POLICE_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Let’s enjoy a fierce battle in the chilly night\nwinds! Brrrr! Refreshing!
1-POLICE_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	It was too dark for me to see very well. Yeah...\nToo dark.
1-POLICE_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Oops, I’d better get back to my beat before the\nboss radios me.
1-POLICE_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_NONE_D	Hi! Hanging in there, Trainer?
1-POLICE_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Still training this late?\c\nI admire that kind of dedication, Trainer!
1-POLICE_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m on patrol to see whether or not there’s any\ntrouble afoot!
1-POLICE_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Big trouble! I need backup Pokémon!
1-POLICE_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Your toughness is too much!\nI’m in serious trouble!
1-POLICE_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_NONE_D	Just between you and me, all this patrolling can\nget pretty demanding.
1-POLICE_04_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Let me ask you a question! Have you trained\nyour Pokémon as well as I have?
1-FISHING_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Can’t you see I’m fishing? Don’t talk! You’ll\nstartle the fish!
1-FISHING_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Sheesh...I let a Pokémon—and that battle—get\naway from me.
1-FISHING_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Fishing and battling are delicate things, as am I.\nIs that wrong?
1-FISHING_06_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	You can see I’m fishing, can’t you? Then don’t\ntalk to me! Geez!
1-FISHING_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I wish some fishing-loving lady’d come along.\nBut no, it’s all just Trainers.
1-FISHING_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Sure, so I lost. But I’ll keep on fishing.
1-FISHING_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If you know of any ladies who like fishing,\nhelp me reel one in!
1-FISHING_07_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Umm...yeah. Weren’t you that person who\npreferred Pokémon over fishing?
1-FISHING_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Water Pokémon sure get happy when it rains.\nSo do I!
1-FISHING_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oof. Just got trampled right under your feet\nthat time!
1-FISHING_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Yup, a kid like you should be running around\noutside, rain or shine.
1-FISHING_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’ve been fishing here ever since I lost to you.
1-RANGERM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Can you keep up with us?
1-RANGERM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’ve got energy to burn!
1-RANGERM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	However hard you battle, make sure you never\nharm the environment.\c\nTry not to break any branches or trample any\nplants, OK?
1-RANGERM_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hey! You’re that high-energy Trainer! I bet you\ncan’t keep up with us now!
1-RANGERM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Are you doing your part to protect the\nenvironment? I am!
1-RANGERM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Good. You seem to be a kindhearted Trainer.
1-RANGERM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	People, Pokémon—all of us! We’re all a part\nof nature.
1-RANGERM_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Heya, long time!\c\nAre you enjoying your nature-filled adventure\nwith Pokémon?
1-RANGERW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Our job is to protect the natural environment of\nthis region.
1-RANGERW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	We have to get tougher than this...
1-RANGERW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I love how natural it is here. I wish I could live\nout here.
1-RANGERW_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	What do you think? The environment is\nunharmed in this area.
1-SCIENTIST_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I find it reassuring to be on this damp soil.
1-SCIENTIST_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Ufufufufu...you had to beat me.
1-SCIENTIST_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It feels good to mope here after a loss. Ufufufu...
1-SCIENTIST_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Is Damp your favorite Pokémon Ability? Fufufu...\nAnything will do.
1-COLLECTOR_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m proud of my Pokémon! Here, I’ll show\nyou why!
1-COLLECTOR_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Youch! You sure showed me how tough\nyou were.
1-COLLECTOR_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Oh, what have we here? That’s a Pokédex!\c\nIt records Pokémon data upon sight? I’ve never\nseen one before!\c\nI heard you can move the sun or moon icon to\ncheck the Pokémon habitat map by time of day!
1-COLLECTOR_07_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I take down details in my notebook about\nPokémon I’ve battled.\c\nI’ll write more data down about your Pokémon!
1-SCIENTIST_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Oh? Here comes a nice Trainer. This is\nworth evaluation.
1-SCIENTIST_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Our research arrived at this one conclusion:\nyou’re tough!
1-SCIENTIST_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	A huge variety of Pokémon live in the\nGreat Marsh.\c\nYou see, countless years ago, this whole area was\nunder the sea.
1-SCIENTIST_06_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh, how do you do? May I investigate how much\ntougher you’ve become since our last encounter?
1-PARASOL_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	There are Pokémon that become more powerful\nwhen it rains.
1-PARASOL_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	When I lose, my tears fall like rain...\nThey call me Rain Woman...
1-PARASOL_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I want to show off my pretty parasol, but it will\nget dirty in the rain.\c\nOh, such a big dilemma!
1-PARASOL_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	On rainy days, I get more energetic!
1-PARASOL_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	When it rains, I get happy!
1-PARASOL_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	It’s not very easy trying to battle while holding\nan umbrella.
1-PARASOL_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If it rained every day, I could have my umbrella\nopen all the time.
1-PARASOL_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	It’s not because it’s raining—I just love umbrellas!
1-POLICE_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My Pokémon and I are always prepared!
1-POLICE_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I was completely unprepared for this...
1-POLICE_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You aren’t just well prepared—you’re tough!
1-POLICE_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_NONE_D	We’re on constant patrol. Even at night, it’s safe\naround here.
1-POLICE_05_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	My Pokémon and I are better prepared this time!
1-SWIMMERM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I swim the whole year round. I’m not losing a\nbattle at sea!
1-SWIMMERM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I lost in the sea—but I swim the whole\nyear round!
1-SWIMMERM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	When you’re out at sea, Water-type Pokémon\nlook more lively.
1-SWIMMERM_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I love the sea. It was only by fluke that I lost\nlast time.
1-SWIMMERM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Brr...I’m starting to get chilly. I could use a win\nto get warmed up.
1-SWIMMERM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The chill of the sea...the coldness of defeat...\c\nIt’s a double whammy.
1-SWIMMERM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Look at my lips—they’re the color of prunes!
1-SWIMMERM_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Brr...I’m starting to feel chilly. How about a hot\nPokémon battle?
1-SWIMMERW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hi, wave-riding Trainer! How about a battle on\nthe sea?
1-SWIMMERW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You sure schooled me there.
1-SWIMMERW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Maybe I should switch to surfing, too...
1-SWIMMERW_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh, hi again! You’re that wave-riding Trainer!
1-SWIMMERW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hello, there! Aren’t you going to swim?
1-SWIMMERW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What’s saltier, my tears or the sea?
1-SWIMMERW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	There aren’t many sea routes that you can swim\nin Sinnoh.\c\nIt makes me want to take a vacation in the\nHoenn region.
1-SWIMMERW_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	When I see people surfing, I don’t feel jealous\nor anything.\c\nI just simply love to swim!
1-UKIWAB_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Isn’t this nice? I love my inner tube!
1-UKIWAB_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I couldn’t move very well because my inner tube\ngot in the way!
1-UKIWAB_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	My mom blew up my inner tube for me. I ran out\nof breath just opening it!
1-UKIWAB_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	You can come back all you like, but you can’t\nhave my inner tube!
1-UKIWAG_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Eheheh...I can battle, too!
1-UKIWAG_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I lost, and now I feel hungry.
1-UKIWAG_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	That cloud looks like ice cream! I wish I could eat\nsome! Mmm...
1-UKIWAG_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’ve been lounging here all this time!
1-SAILOR_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Traveling alone, are you? That’s impressive! How\nabout we battle?
1-SAILOR_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re good, pip-squeak!
1-SAILOR_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Maybe I’ll go work out down at the\nrestaurant again.\c\nThat place gets different people in every day,\nand they all like battles.
1-SAILOR_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hey, lonesome traveler! Let’s break the\nmonotony with another battle!
1-FISHING_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Awwww! I almost had that fish reeled in!
1-FISHING_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You need to have more respect for a grown-up.
1-FISHING_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You need to settle down some.
1-FISHING_09_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Awwww! I was just reeling that fish in!\c\nOh, no, not you again!
1-SISTER_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Let me demonstrate my technique. It’s how this\ngrown-up battles.
1-SISTER_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That’s how you attack? Pshaw!
1-SISTER_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You’re so much more of a Trainer than you look!
1-SISTER_05_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Give this grown-up another chance to\ndemonstrate her technique.
1-ISEKI_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	This area seems to be very mystifying. That’s the\nsense I get.\c\nTo show you what I mean, I’ll battle with the\nPokémon I found.
1-ISEKI_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I can’t win with Pokémon that I’m not\nfamiliar with.
1-ISEKI_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	This area seems to be very mystifying. That’s the\nsense I get.
1-ISEKI_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Ah-ha! I found me a Trainer!\c\nI challenge you to battle with the Pokémon\nI’ve found!
1-ISEKI_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve been traveling around the world chasing\nstories on mysteries.\c\nIt’s made me pretty tough!
1-ISEKI_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	*sigh* That’s a downer.
1-ISEKI_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	There are mysteries waiting for me to investigate\naround the world.\c\nThis is no time to be feeling sorry for myself.
1-ISEKI_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	There’s an endless supply of mysteries around\nthe world.\c\nRunning into you here just happens to be one\nsuch mystery!
1-ESPM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’d sensed the presence of a Trainer for a while.\nIt was you!
1-ESPM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Defeating you will be no easy matter.
1-ESPM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Is it possible to become more powerful by\nunderstanding Pokémon?
1-ESPM_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I was certain that you’d return. I sensed your\npresence, you see.
1-ESPW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Look out! Behind you! What is it?
1-ESPW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My plan to scare you didn’t go over well at all.
1-ESPW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You might be tough, but let down your guard at\nyour own risk!
1-ESPW_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Whoa! That thing curled around your neck!\c\n...Nice scarf, kid!
1-GAMBLER_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Win or lose...who knows how this’ll go?\c\nWe’re playing for keeps!
1-GAMBLER_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I guessed wrong too often.
1-GAMBLER_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I can’t get into the groove. That’s enough\nfor today.
1-GAMBLER_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I wasn’t lucky the other day. Things will be\ndifferent today.
1-COLLECTOR_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	For the sake of my collection, I take on people I\nknow I can’t beat.\c\nThat’s what a collector does.
1-COLLECTOR_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You should boast more about that last attack.
1-COLLECTOR_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m proud of having a Pokémon that others\ndon’t have.\c\nOh, and I’m also proud of winning the second\nprize on Jubilife TV’s daily drawings.
1-COLLECTOR_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	For the sake of my collection, I keep battling\npeople I can’t beat.\c\nThat’s what a collector does.
1-COLLECTOR_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Whaaat? You do! You do have a Pokédex!
1-COLLECTOR_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m so envious of your Pokédex.
1-COLLECTOR_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Trainers have all sorts of Pokémon with\nthem, right?\c\nSo, the more Trainers you battle, the more your\nPokédex will fill up!
1-COLLECTOR_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I don’t have a Pokédex, but that’s all right.\c\nYou come here and show me!
1-COLLECTOR_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	To find my favorite Pokémon, I’ll go east, west,\nor any which way!
1-COLLECTOR_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	But they’re my favorite Pokémon!
1-COLLECTOR_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If you’re trying to find the Pokémon you want,\nyou need to go everywhere!\c\nNot just east and west, either. South and north\nare important, too!
1-COLLECTOR_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	For my favorite Pokémon, I’ll go east, west, or\nany which way!\c\nSaying that, I’ve been wandering around here all\nthis time.
1-SISTER_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Oh? You want to teach me something\nabout Pokémon?
1-SISTER_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wow, is that right?
1-SISTER_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	There are so many kinds of Pokémon. I can’t\ndecide which one to pamper.
1-SISTER_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Yoo-hoo, little kid! Can you teach me some more\nabout Pokémon?
1-KARATE_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I was snoozing, you claim? I merely feigned\nsleep! Hiyah!
1-KARATE_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	*gurgle*
1-KARATE_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I feigned a loss! Hiyah!
1-KARATE_05_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Am I lost, you ask? I merely feigned it! Hiyah!
1-KARATE_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Check the sharpness of my Fighting-type\nPokémon’s moves.
1-KARATE_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’ve dulled its sharpness...
1-KARATE_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Back to training for us!
1-KARATE_06_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I sharpened my Pokémon’s moves more for when\nI saw you again!
1-KARATE_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Every drop of sweat I shed makes me that\nmuch stronger!
1-KARATE_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I don’t want to believe this happened, but a loss\nis a loss.
1-KARATE_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Time to shed some more sweat!
1-KARATE_07_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	We’re going to win this time! Don’t believe me?\nThen you test it out!
1-JOGGER_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	*huff huff huff huff*\nWant—*huff*—a battle? *huff*
1-JOGGER_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	*huff huff*\nWe—*huff*—lose. *huff*
1-JOGGER_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Bye—*huff*—now. *huff*\n*huff huff huff huff*
1-JOGGER_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_NONE_DN	Running—*huff*—is—*huff*—good. *huff*\nOver—*huff*—doing—*huff*—it isn’t! *huff*\r\n*huff huff huff huff*
1-JOGGER_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	*huff huff huff huff*\nWe—*huff*—meet—*huff*—again? *huff*
1-ELITEM_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ll battle anyone. That’s how I’ll get better!
1-ELITEM_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You won and I lost, but the both of us gained\nsomething from this.
1-ELITEM_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	In a Pokémon battle, it doesn’t matter how old or\nyoung you are.\c\nYour gender doesn’t matter, either. Nothing like\nthat means anything!
1-ELITEM_06_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’ll battle against people who’ve beaten me\nagain and again.\c\nBy doing that, we both grow a little as Trainers.
1-ELITEW_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m taking the Veilstone Gym challenge.\nBut first...
1-ELITEW_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You made me lose my confidence...
1-ELITEW_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I think about Pokémon all day long. I was\nconfident, you know.
1-ELITEW_11_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh, it’s you again!\c\nI’ve regained my confidence. Let’s have\nanother battle!
1-ISEKI_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m a treasure hunter. Today, the loot is a victory\nfrom you!
1-ISEKI_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I can’t win. You’re too much to take!
1-ISEKI_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If one’s after treasures, maybe looking\nunderground is the better choice.
1-ISEKI_04_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’m a treasure hunter. This time, I will have my\ntrophy: a victory from you!
1-JOGGER_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	If I battle now, won’t it mess up my usual pace?
1-JOGGER_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My pace is completely off...
1-JOGGER_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Sticking to one’s own goal is more important\nthan it seems.\c\nIf you match your goal with someone else, you’ll\nlose your identity.
1-JOGGER_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_NONE_DN	Well, yes, sometimes I do walk. I even stop\non occasion. I am human, after all.
1-JOGGER_05_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Up till now, I’d maintained my pace.\nBut seeing you threw me off!
1-COLDELITEM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m an ace. I can see that you’re an ace, too!
1-COLDELITEM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Just as I thought...
1-COLDELITEM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You can pretend to be ordinary, but your eyes\ntell me another story.
1-COLDELITEM_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	A real ace doesn’t get hung up on getting wins.\c\nA real ace sets sights consistently higher to\nimprove themselves.
1-COLDELITEM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I always battle for keeps. This is no drill!
1-COLDELITEM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Good job! That was an excellent battle.
1-COLDELITEM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If you don’t play for keeps, you’ll lose battles\nyou should be dominating.
1-COLDELITEM_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	When I lost to you last time, I was battling\nfor keeps.\c\nBut this time, I really mean it. This is seriously\nfor keeps!
1-COLDELITEW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m fully kitted up and equipped! Anytime will\nbe fine!
1-COLDELITEW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hunh?!
1-COLDELITEW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Perhaps I should maybe change into a more\ncomfy outfit...
1-COLDELITEW_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’m fully equipped again today! Anytime you’re\nready will be fine!
1-COLDELITEW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	To be ready to answer any call! To be ready to\naccept any challenge!\c\nThat is the way of a Trainer!
1-COLDELITEW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	How disappointing!
1-COLDELITEW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You can make all the preparations in the world,\nbut if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work.
1-COLDELITEW_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I got everything ready so we could have a\nrematch whenever you came.
1-SKIERM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m skiing right now, but OK. As we skiers say,\n“Spur thing!”
1-SKIERM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	...I’ve hit an ice patch!
1-SKIERM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I quite enjoyed that battle! Let us meet again.\nSki ya!
1-SKIERM_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	We might get snowbound, but why not? It’s on\nthe “spur” of the moment!
1-SKIERM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Are you a novice? Or are you capable?
1-SKIERM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I never expected you to be an expert...
1-SKIERM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You know how to play your Pokémon with\nan edge!
1-SKIERM_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Knowing you to be an expert, I challenge you to\na rematch!
1-SKIERW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	What’s fun about winter? Number one: skiing!\nNumber two: Pokémon!
1-SKIERW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	*snivel*
1-SKIERW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If it was skiing, I wouldn’t lose. I should go ski\nwith my Pokémon...
1-SKIERW_01_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	You’re a better Trainer than a skier. But I’ll\nchallenge you again anyway!
1-SKIERW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	How do you expect to battle in this\nheavy snow?
1-SKIERW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The winds of victory shifted...
1-SKIERW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You even had the cold winds on your side.\c\nI guess you kids are tougher than people my age.
1-SKIERW_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Why would you wander around here? You must\nreally like it here.
1-KARATE_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I can withstand this cold. That means I can take\nany kind of attack!
1-KARATE_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Huh? It’s over, you say?
1-KARATE_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Oh gosh, this is bad! I think I’m losing feeling all\nover my body!
1-KARATE_10_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh? I’ve seen your face before. What say\nwe battle?
1-COLDELITEM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	This cold is but nothing compared to the fire that\nburns in my heart!
1-COLDELITEM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your heart burns as hot as mine!
1-COLDELITEM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The weather clears up sometimes. The view is\nbreathtaking then.
1-COLDELITEM_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	We’ll come at you with our hearts ablaze!
1-COLDELITEW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Wh-what is it? P-Pokémon battle?!
1-COLDELITEW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Whew... You are alive, aren’t you?
1-COLDELITEW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Around these parts, perhaps because of all the\nsnow, there are many folktales of hauntings...
1-COLDELITEW_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	This isn’t like last time. See how much I’ve\ntrained since then!
1-SKIERM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ll show you the techniques I had drummed into\nme at ski school!
1-SKIERM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I don’t believe it... My techniques were rebuffed...
1-SKIERM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I should have enrolled in a Pokémon\nTrainers’ school...
1-SKIERM_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Since I lost to you last time, I redid my training at\nski school!
1-SKIERM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We skiers feel Mother Nature through the soles\nof our feet!
1-SKIERM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I got a good taste of your power!
1-SKIERM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Trainers get an appreciation of life through\nPokémon. At least I think so.
1-SKIERM_04_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I knew you were headed back here. I felt it with\nthe soles of my feet!
1-SKIERW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve been skiing with Pokémon since I was just\nfive years old.
1-SKIERW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, um, wait... What?!
1-SKIERW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The scenery doesn’t change very much around\nhere. Don’t go getting lost!
1-SKIERW_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh... Did you maybe get lost again? You should\npay more attention!
1-SKIERW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Rainy days make me feel blue...\c\nBut the instant it starts to snow, I’m as happy as\ncan be!
1-SKIERW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The conditions weren’t very good.
1-SKIERW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Does your Pokétch have that hidden move to\nclimb cliffs?
1-SKIERW_04_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	You really must like snow. After all, if you didn’t,\nI doubt that you’d come here so often!
1-SHINOBI_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	*poof*\c\nYou’ve got a good eye, spotting me!
1-SHINOBI_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You also saw through my weak spots...
1-SHINOBI_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ll play with my Pokémon—even in a blizzard!
1-SHINOBI_06_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	*poof*\c\nYou saw through my camouflage again!
1-SHINOBI_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	There are several kinds of ninjas. Are you an Iga\nor a Kouga ninja?
1-SHINOBI_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m not much of a ninja either way...
1-SHINOBI_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I wonder why everyone stops being a ninja when\nthey grow up?
1-SHINOBI_07_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I forged my willpower in the snow! Witness my\nsnowy might!
1-KARATE_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	To make sure I’m more agile, I always dress light!
1-KARATE_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Achoo!
1-KARATE_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I might have to go home and dress warmer\nthan this...
1-KARATE_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’m sticking it out and staying lightly dressed!
1-FISHING_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Yeah, yeah... Nothing’s biting!
1-FISHING_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	...
1-FISHING_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	When nothing’s biting, the smart thing to do is\njust call it a day.
1-FISHING_11_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Yeah, yeah... Nothing’s biting today either.
1-FISHING_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Outdoor fishing for the win!\c\nShouting doesn’t help my fishing any, but shout\nI must!
1-FISHING_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Gwaaah! This is hurting!
1-FISHING_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Oh, right... My shouting is scaring away\nthe Pokémon.
1-FISHING_10_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Super outdoor fishing! Shouting still doesn’t help!
1-GUITARIST_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Let it rock! It’s the rhythm of battle!
1-GUITARIST_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Can you hear it? That’s my guitar, weeping...
1-GUITARIST_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m too torn up to sing anymore... I am so cool\nthat way...
1-GUITARIST_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Rock ’n’ roll! We’ll beat it out again: our rhythm\nof battle!
1-SAILOR_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	A man of the sea is also a man of Pokémon!
1-SAILOR_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Anchors aweigh!
1-SAILOR_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You’ve got what it takes to be a Trainer\namong Trainers!
1-SAILOR_06_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Rudder hard to starboard! Hold on!\nNobody go overboard!
1-UKIWAB_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I love my inner tube. So I admire\njellyfish Pokémon!
1-UKIWAB_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m drifting away...
1-UKIWAB_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I wish Professor Rowan would give me a Pokédex.\nBut that old guy looks kind of scary.
1-UKIWAB_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I love my inner tube. So I admire\njellyfish Pokémon.\c\nWon’t you hang out with us and just bob around\non the waves?
1-UKIWAG_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I can’t swim without my floaty. But my Pokémon\nsure can!
1-UKIWAG_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	They weren’t tough, my Pokémon...
1-UKIWAG_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	My mommy said that Professor Rowan is\nreally kindhearted.
1-UKIWAG_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh! You’re the Trainer who played with us before!\c\nCan you see if my Pokémon have grown stronger?
1-SWIMMERM_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I only live to swim. Teach me what’s so fun\nabout Pokémon!
1-SWIMMERM_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wow, that was fun!
1-SWIMMERM_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ll try swimming with Pokémon next.
1-SWIMMERM_07_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Yo! You’re that Trainer who taught me how fun\nPokémon can be.\c\nLet’s have another battle, you and me!
1-SWIMMERM_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	On your marks... Get set...
1-SWIMMERM_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Owowowow! My leg cramped up!
1-SWIMMERM_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I forgot to do my stretching exercises...
1-SWIMMERM_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hi, I was waiting for you!\nReady? On your marks... Get set...
1-SWIMMERM_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	OK! Get your breathing in order! OK! You’re\nready to go!
1-SWIMMERM_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I let my momentum falter...
1-SWIMMERM_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Listen, I have something important to say to you.\nDon’t drown in your own talent.
1-SWIMMERM_09_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	OK! You’re ready to go! This time, I’m going for\nthe win!
1-SWIMMERW_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Swimming is a full-body exercise. You should\nswim, too!
1-SWIMMERW_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Sunk like a stone!
1-SWIMMERW_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Well, Pokémon’s one thing, but you should take\nup swimming, too!
1-SWIMMERW_06_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hiya, Pokémon-riding Trainer! You should be\nswimming like me!
1-SWIMMERW_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	The human body floats more easily in the sea, so\nit’s easy to swim!
1-SWIMMERW_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The water’s too salty!
1-SWIMMERW_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ve got that sinking feeling...
1-SWIMMERW_07_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Pokémon can stay afloat even while carrying\nsomeone. That’s so cool!
1-SWIMMERW_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I may not look it now, but I’m a star. I’m always\nwith my Pokémon.
1-SWIMMERW_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I lost, but at least I had fun.
1-SWIMMERW_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If it were an underwater Pokémon show, I would\nhave shined.
1-SWIMMERW_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh, hi! Are you back to see our Pokémon\nshow again?
1-SWIMMERW_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I bought a new bikini! It’s this year’s\nnewest model!
1-SWIMMERW_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Psssssh!
1-SWIMMERW_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I made a mistake buying this bikini... It’s a little\ntoo tight...
1-SWIMMERW_18_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Did I show you already? My bikini, new for\nthis year!
1-SWIMMERM_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Well? Does it look like I’m swimming gracefully?
1-SWIMMERM_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m finally feeling fatigued...
1-SWIMMERM_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I may look like I’m swimming gracefully, but\nbeneath the surface, I’m kicking furiously.
1-SWIMMERM_10_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	You were attracted by my graceful swimming\nagain, weren’t you?
1-SWIMMERW_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Water-type Pokémon come in a great variety of\nshapes and sizes.\c\nI’ll show you the Water Pokémon that I’ve picked\nfor myself!
1-SWIMMERW_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I can’t boast when I lose... I’m so disappointed...
1-SWIMMERW_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Sure I lost, but watch me! I’ll get tougher with\nWater Pokémon.
1-SWIMMERW_09_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	This time, my Water Pokémon will show you why\nI’m so proud of them!
1-FISHING_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hey. I like fishing. But my true love is battling!
1-FISHING_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	*sploosh*
1-FISHING_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If you don’t know how to fish, you’re missing half\nof life’s enjoyment.\c\nIf you don’t know Pokémon...you’re missing out\non all of it!
1-FISHING_12_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Come on—battle me again! You know I love to\nfish and battle!
1-ELITEM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	People consider me an Ace Trainer.\c\nLet me demonstrate the skills that earned me\nthat title!
1-ELITEM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m burning with jealousy over your raw talent!
1-ELITEM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I think keeping up the effort to better yourself is\na talent in itself.
1-ELITEM_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Last time, you beat me before I had a chance to\nshow you my skill.\c\nThis time, I’ll show you why they consider me\nan ace!
1-ELITEW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Oh? You intend to beat me? I am an ace,\nyou know.
1-ELITEW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I see... I have to concede defeat.
1-ELITEW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	To not be depressed by a loss... That’s one trait\nof an ace.
1-ELITEW_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Ace Trainers always work to improve their\nnatural-born talents.
1-COLLECTOR_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You’re going to Ramanas Park?\c\nIt’s not right that you get to go before a\ncollector like me!
1-COLLECTOR_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re one enthusiastic Trainer.
1-COLLECTOR_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Ramanas Park, huh? I wonder what kinds of\nPokémon you can see there?
1-COLLECTOR_04_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Listen—did you go to Ramanas Park? What was it\nlike? What was it like?
1-FISHING_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m in the middle of fishing, but OK. I’ll be happy\nto sink you.
1-FISHING_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Whooah!
1-FISHING_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The one that got away was a big one...
1-FISHING_13_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Once I hook it, no fish gets away from me!\c\nA Trainer walking by also can’t get free of\nmy clutches!
1-FISHING_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hi, traveler! How would you like to battle?
1-FISHING_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You sure showed me up.
1-FISHING_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I like to fish. You’re a traveler.\c\nFarewell, until we meet again!
1-FISHING_14_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hi, traveler! I’ve forgotten your name, but we’ve\nbattled before, haven’t we?
1-FISHING_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m getting bored of fishing. Let’s have a\nquick battle!
1-FISHING_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’ve been done in...
1-FISHING_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Thanks, Trainer. That was a good change of pace.
1-FISHING_15_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Yo! I remember how our battle was a good\nchange of pace before.\c\nLet’s have another quick battle!
1-FISHING_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	If I stare at the water’s surface for too long, I\nbegin to forget what I was doing in the\r\nfirst place.
1-FISHING_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I don’t know how, but I lost!
1-FISHING_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Oh, right... I was fishing, wasn’t I?
1-FISHING_16_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	When I looked up from staring at the water’s\nsurface, I saw your face.\c\nI’m not sure about what I was just doing, but do\nyou want to battle?
1-SAILOR_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	It takes both brains and brawn when you’re out\nat sea.\c\nAye, it’s not an easy job, the sailor’s life!
1-SAILOR_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	*glub glub glub*
1-SAILOR_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If you were to become a sailor, I’m sure you’d\nmake a good one!
1-SAILOR_02_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’ll beat you this time and convince you to\nbecome a sailor!
1-SAILOR_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Oh, we’ll ride upon the sea,\nin a boat, just you and me! ♪\c\nThat’s the way of the sailor! Way of the sailor. ♪\nYou sing, too!
1-SAILOR_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your Pokémon... They’re looking good!
1-SAILOR_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You ought to think about becoming a\nsailor yourself.\c\nIt’s been great to be able to visit different places\naround the world.
1-SAILOR_05_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh, we’ll ride upon the sea,\nin a boat, just you and me! ♪\c\nThat’s the way of the sailor! Way of the sailor. ♪\nYou sing, too!
1-POLICE_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Who’s there?! Oh, it’s only a kid. You scared me!
1-POLICE_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m a bit of a scaredy-cat, so I’m always paying\nclose attention to everything.
1-POLICE_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m no tough guy, and yet here I am on patrol.\nFunny how things go.
1-POLICE_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_NONE_D	I can’t explain why, but I’m more easily agitated\nat night—not that I let it get to me.
1-POLICE_06_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hey, is that you again? You scared me! Again!\nDo you really want to battle that badly?
1-PRINCE_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m quite bored. Care to break the monotony?
1-PRINCE_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The monotony was broken, but at what cost?
1-PRINCE_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ll go rest at the hotel. I’ve had quite enough\nof this.
1-PRINCE_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Ah, it’s you. I’m bored yet again. Care to break\nthe monotony?
1-SISTER_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	After enjoying a meal at the hotel restaurant, one\nhas a battle. That’s the social etiquette.
1-SISTER_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Enchanting.
1-SISTER_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Personally, I would rather just play with Pokémon\nthan battle with them.
1-SISTER_09_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I only seem to run into you after I go to\nthe restaurant.\c\nEtiquette calls for a battle after a meal. Shall we?
1-UKIWAB_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Look, look! Look at my Pokémon! It’s really cool!
1-UKIWAB_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oof! I had to hold on tight to my inner tube!
1-UKIWAB_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Pools are OK, but I like the sea because\nPokémon live there.
1-UKIWAB_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Yay! You came to see my Pokémon again, right?\nLook, look!
1-UKIWAG_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Listen, listen! Can you tell me what kind of\nPokémon you have?
1-UKIWAG_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re so tough. I’m stunned...
1-UKIWAG_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I want to hang on to a Buizel and just\nbob around.
1-UKIWAG_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Listen, listen! Did you find any new kinds\nof Pokémon?
1-SAILOR_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I came out here because I wanted to see the\nPokémon League for myself.
1-SAILOR_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m shocked... No, really, I am.
1-SAILOR_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The way I battle now, well, I can only look at the\nPokémon League!\c\nYou go on! You go to the Pokémon League for\nme, too!
1-SAILOR_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’ve been training here in hopes of going to the\nPokémon League.
1-SWIMMERM_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve decided! If I can beat you, I’m going to the\nPokémon League!
1-SWIMMERM_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	*blblblblugh*
1-SWIMMERM_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It’s OK. Just let me float away like driftwood...
1-SWIMMERM_11_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’ve decided! If I finally beat you, I’m headed for\nthe Pokémon League!
1-SWIMMERM_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	It might not look like it, but I’m traveling now.
1-SWIMMERM_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’ve got the upper hand on me.
1-SWIMMERM_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	But you can be sure that there will be bigger\nchallenges in front of you.\c\nGo! Go as far as you can! You alone can broaden\nyour horizons.
1-SWIMMERM_12_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’m still on my journey... Let’s have a battle!
1-SWIMMERM_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	The sea around here is harsh. It’s made me just\nas harsh!
1-SWIMMERM_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The world is so harsh...
1-SWIMMERM_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	What? You’ve got that many Gym Badges?\nNo wonder you’re so tough...
1-SWIMMERM_13_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	It’s me again! The harsh sea here should have\ntoughened me up more!
1-SWIMMERM_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My dream is to swim in the sea in every region\nunder the sun!
1-SWIMMERM_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Boo! I’m not done with my dream!
1-SWIMMERM_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I wonder what the seas are like in Kanto\nand Hoenn...
1-SWIMMERM_14_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	My new dream is to challenge all the Pokémon\nLeagues in every region!
1-SWIMMERM_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Yes, I know I can surf, but I’d rather swim instead.\c\nIt does seem weird—I agree.
1-SWIMMERM_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	*kaploosh*
1-SWIMMERM_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If you don’t know how, I’m willing to show you\nhow to swim.
1-SWIMMERM_15_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	If you rely on your Pokémon all the time, you’ll\nnever learn how to swim!
1-SWIMMERM_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I train at a Pokémon Gym, too. Don’t think you’re\ngoing to win easily!
1-SWIMMERM_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Master Wake... No, Crasher Wake... I’m so sorry\nto have failed you...
1-SWIMMERM_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	What to do... Train at the Gym again, or train\nby myself...?
1-SWIMMERM_16_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I trained at the Gym after you beat me. Let’s do\nit, gang!
1-SWIMMERW_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m determined to go to the Pokémon League, no\nmatter how hard it is.
1-SWIMMERW_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Th-this is so hard...
1-SWIMMERW_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Losing won’t make me give up. The Pokémon\nLeague isn’t going anywhere.
1-SWIMMERW_10_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	It doesn’t matter how long it takes—I’m going to\nthe Pokémon League!
1-SWIMMERW_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Excuse me for wearing my bikini!
1-SWIMMERW_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Was I multitasking too much, battling and\nswimming at the same time?
1-SWIMMERW_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	When I’m in my bikini, I’m at a loss about where\nto carry my Poké Balls!
1-SWIMMERW_11_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	*giggle*\nExcuse me for wearing my bikini!
1-SWIMMERW_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Deep breathing before battle!
1-SWIMMERW_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Inhale... Exhale...
1-SWIMMERW_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Deep breathing after battle, too!
1-SWIMMERW_12_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Don’t get careless, even if you’re facing\nsomeone familiar.\c\nDo your deep-breathing exercises...
1-SWIMMERW_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I found a Trainer who’s floating in the water!
1-SWIMMERW_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’ve had my fill...
1-SWIMMERW_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m tired of swimming, so I’ll just float around\nand get some rest.
1-SWIMMERW_13_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	How much stronger have your Pokémon become?\nLet me check ’em out, OK?
1-SWIMMERW_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Did you know? I was crowned the champion of a\nswimsuit contest!\c\nSo now, I’m trying to win a title at a Super\nContest Show!
1-SWIMMERW_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’ve been sunk!
1-SWIMMERW_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ll need to rework my strategy!
1-SWIMMERW_14_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I became the champion of a swimsuit contest...\nI’m a super-talented girl!\c\nI’m challenging you so I can become the champ\nof a Super Contest Show!
1-SWIMMERW_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My favorite kind of guy is someone that looks\ngood out on the open sea!
1-SWIMMERW_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The tide is going out...
1-SWIMMERW_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	...Though there’s a mysterious nature that\nsurrounds a mountain man...
1-SWIMMERW_15_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hello again! You’re that Trainer who looks keen\nwith their Pokémon!
1-WORKER_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Fine, all righty then. Just a quick battle on\nmy break!
1-WORKER_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wahaha! Mercy! I cry mercy!
1-WORKER_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’d better get on back to work...\c\nYou know, I’d rather be traveling around with\nPokémon the way you do.
1-WORKER_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m gonna let you in on a secret... I snuck my\nPokémon to work!
1-WORKER_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Well, now aren’t you something!
1-WORKER_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	OK, OK, time for work! I’ll work up a thirst with\nmy Pokémon!
1-MUSHI_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	What’s cool, you might ask? No? I’ll tell you\nanyway: bug Pokémon!
1-MUSHI_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	It bugs me when people ignore the awesome\ncoolness of bug Pokémon!
1-MUSHI_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It would seem that coolness alone doesn’t add\nup to any wins...
1-MUSHI_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Here comes the swarm!
1-MUSHI_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Whoooh...
1-MUSHI_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Did you know? “Swarm” is the name of a\nPokémon Ability.
1-MUSHI_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My senses tingle... I’ve spotted a rare Pokémon!
1-MUSHI_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Awawawawah...
1-MUSHI_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I thought it was a rare Pokémon, but it turned out\nto be just a Trainer!
1-MINI_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We’re just out on a power walk!
1-MINI_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, you!
1-MINI_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Ewww, nasty! This forest is full of bug Pokémon...\c\nI also forgot to buy some Antidotes. It’s just the\nworst thing ever!
1-ESPM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	When a Trainer and a Pokémon bond as one, a\nwondrous power is born...
1-ESPM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hmm...
1-ESPM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	There still remain many mysteries yet to be\nsolved in this strange world...
1-ESPM_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	A strange presence has been felt... It is\nemanating from...you!
1-ESPM_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh! Be one with me, my Meditite!
1-ESPM_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The Old Chateau... I sense...a particularly strong\npresence there.
1-ESPW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I see it... I see it...\c\nI see you going down in defeat...
1-ESPW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	It is I that have gone down in defeat.
1-ESPW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The Old Chateau...lies abandoned, with none\nliving in its walls...\c\nAnd yet, and yet, there permeates a presence...
1-ESPW_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	This forest is strange, you know... It seems to fill\nme with energy...
1-ESPW_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your victory... There is nothing strange about it.
1-ESPW_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Forests are mystifying... They seem to gather such\nunexplainable energy.
1-ELITEM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You... One look at you tells me you’re a\nreal contender!
1-ELITEM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re as tough as you look.
1-ELITEM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	One day, people will run to the other side of the\nroad when I walk by ’em.\c\nIt’s a goal of mine I’m working on.
1-ELITEM_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Victory Road... Somehow, it feels as if my journey\nis now coming to an end.\c\nBut before the final chapter is written, I must\npen your defeat!
1-ELITEM_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That wasn’t how I planned the final chapter to go\nin my writing class...
1-ELITEM_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If you don’t give up, you can reach your goal.\c\nThat perseverance is what’s important to Trainers.\nThat’s in my book, too.
1-ELITEW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Show me how you’ve battled to get here!\nLet’s do this!
1-ELITEW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	So, that’s how you battled...?
1-ELITEW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Once you emerge from Victory Road, the\nPokémon League lies directly ahead...\c\nBut many Trainers fail to ever find their way on\nVictory Road...
1-ELITEW_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	This total stranger’ll be a good way to see if I\nhave what it takes to own the Pokémon League’s\r\nElite Four!
1-ELITEW_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That battle just now must make you tougher than\neveryone in the world.
1-ELITEW_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It doesn’t appear as if anyone could even try to\nstand against your might.\c\nThe Elite Four should just surrender.
1-VETERAN_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I can sense that your Pokémon have a lot of trust\nin you.\c\nYou and your Pokémon... You seem to be aglow.
1-VETERAN_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Ah, I understand it now!
1-VETERAN_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You blaze with so much vitality!
1-VETERAN_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Let me take a measure of how much you have\nraised your Pokémon!
1-VETERAN_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Brilliant!
1-VETERAN_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Rather than navigating Victory Road, I have a\nmuch better time putting young Trainers like you\r\nto the test.
1-DRAGON_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m making an already-strong Pokémon grow\neven stronger. I’ll need your help with this!
1-DRAGON_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	There’s no way I could have won!
1-DRAGON_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Now how am I gonna teach it the most powerful\nDragon-type moves...? Well?
1-DRAGON_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Top-level Trainers gather around this\nplace naturally.\c\nI’d go so far as to call it the ideal place to train\nwith the best!
1-DRAGON_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That’s why I like it here; I get to battle tough\ncharacters like you.
1-DRAGON_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	When two roads diverge, you must choose the\npath less traveled...
1-KARATE_17_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My Pokémon knows karate! I’m warning you.\nIt’s a tough one!
1-KARATE_17_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’ve met my match in strength!
1-KARATE_17_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ve made it this far in life using the karate I\nlearned on the internet!
1-BIRD_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I keep battling so I can soar ever higher into\nthe skies!
1-BIRD_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	It seems I’ve been grounded...
1-BIRD_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The wings of freedom...\c\nI know I’ll find them if I can win my way through\nthe Pokémon League...
1-ESPM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Be warned, mortal! I can see the future!
1-ESPM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	So be it! I will now divulge what I know of your\nfuture... Hmm!
1-ESPM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	In the Pokémon League ahead, the Elite Four\nawait you!\c\nBut you knew that already.
1-ESPW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I can see the past!
1-ESPW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	There’s just so much in your past...
1-ESPW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Did you... Did you meet a Legendary Pokémon?\c\nNo. That can’t be right...
1-DOUBLETEAM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_1	It’s a double team of aces! We’re gonna\noverwhelm you!
1-DOUBLETEAM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_1	You and your Pokémon will gain power by\nhelping each other out.
1-DOUBLETEAM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_1	The combination of you and your awesome\nPokémon... It’s the ultimate tag team!
1-DOUBLETEAM_02_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_1	If you don’t mind, we’re hoping for some\ntwo-on-two battle action.
1-DOUBLETEAM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_2	We form a combination that’s in perfect sync!\nHow do you expect to counter that?
1-DOUBLETEAM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_2	You and your Pokémon make a\nbeautiful combination!
1-DOUBLETEAM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_2	Yup, the way you battle is fantastic!\c\nYou should try to take on the Elite Four right\nnow—not later!
1-DOUBLETEAM_02_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_2	We want to have a battle without an advantage.\c\nPlease come back when you have at least\ntwo Pokémon!
1-DOUBLETEAM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_1	I intend to perfect my Double Battle technique.\nThat will make me better all around.
1-DOUBLETEAM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_1	You! You’re an expert Double Battler, too!
1-DOUBLETEAM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_1	Your mastery over several Pokémon at once...\nYou’re a remarkable Trainer!
1-DOUBLETEAM_03_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_1	You have but one Pokémon?\c\nI would say that you are taking Victory Road too\nlightly, kid.
1-DOUBLETEAM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_2	I want to improve my technique as a Trainer,\nand as a Double Battler, as much as I can.
1-DOUBLETEAM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_2	My goodness! You’re great at Double Battles!
1-DOUBLETEAM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_2	Depending on the combinations, every kind of\nPokémon can excel. At least, that’s what I think.
1-DOUBLETEAM_03_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_2	You’re really going through Victory Road with\nonly one Pokémon?
1-CAMPB_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We Trainers will accept challenges anywhere!\nIt’s what we do.
1-CAMPB_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hmm... Insufficiently raised?
1-CAMPB_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Gee... When you’re in a cave, wild Pokémon can\nappear anytime!
1-PICNICG_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	To celebrate my getting through this cave, I’m\ngoing to battle you!
1-PICNICG_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Well, I guess losing is something to\ncommemorate, too...
1-PICNICG_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Getting through this cave feels like an adventure.
1-VETERAN_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m a Veteran, yes, but don’t you dare treat me\nlike a senior citizen!
1-VETERAN_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hnuuurgh... So much skill for one so young!
1-VETERAN_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ll always remain young at heart. Never let them\nsay you’re too old!
1-LEADER7_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	Oh, what’s this? My last one! This is where we\nmake our stand!
1-LEADER7_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	We’re not done yet! There’s no giving up!
1-LEADER7_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hmm! My sturdy Pokémon, defeated!
1-KARATE_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Aiyaah! We’re coming out swinging with\nsuper-heavy judo chops!
1-KARATE_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That was...a complete trashing!
1-KARATE_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I must rededicate myself to training. The road\nextends into infinity...
1-WORKER_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Up and down you go on the lifts. Me?\nI like to battle!
1-WORKER_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’ve got me feeling down!
1-WORKER_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I can’t keep this up! I’ll go back to working on\nthe lifts.
1-WORKER_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	A Pokémon Gym isn’t only about seeing how\ntough your Pokémon happen to be.\c\nIt’s so much deeper than just that. It’s a test of\nyou as a person.
1-WORKER_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That move was devastating!
1-WORKER_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I get to work all day with my Pokémon—and even\nbattle sometimes.\c\nI get all the fun I need every day!
1-ELITEM_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	An ace has the knowledge and experience of\nbattling at high levels.\c\nI’ll demonstrate what that means to a noob\nlike you!
1-ELITEM_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wow... I’m in the mood to sing a lullaby...
1-ELITEM_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Your earnest enthusiasm... I guess that kinda\nmakes you an ace.\c\nMaybe you’re a Trainer who has the potential to\nsurpass aces!
1-ELITEW_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	By focusing on only one type, you can really see\nthe strengths and weaknesses of that Pokémon.
1-ELITEW_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My focus was too narrow-minded...
1-ELITEW_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Start by learning to truly appreciate\nyour Pokémon.\c\nIf you do that, you’ll learn naturally how you\nshould battle with it.
1-KARATE_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Steel represents an unbending spirit!\c\nIf you never give up, the path to victory\nreveals itself!
1-KARATE_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I never gave up, but still I failed to win...
1-KARATE_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If you give up, well, that’s when everything ends\nfor you!
1-WORKER_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Pokémon and people have worked together for\nmany years.\c\nLet us show you an example of that history!
1-WORKER_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	A spectacular loss! But it’s still a loss!
1-WORKER_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The way you helped each other... That is what\nmade you prevail!
1-GINGALEADER1_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_FIRST_DAMAGE	What do you think you’re doing to my Pokémon?!
1-GINGALEADER1_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	This can’t be! I lost?! You...you annoying brat!
1-GINGAM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I ain’t fooling around, kid. This is how a\nprofessional does it!
1-GINGAM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You messed up my job... Now I’m not gonna get\na bonus...
1-GINGAM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I hear they’re going to do something with\nelectricity, I think.
1-GINGAM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Collecting electricity from the Valley\nWindworks... That’s our mission.
1-GINGAM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I really don’t like kids who also happen to be\ntough Trainers...
1-GINGAM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You don’t have an inkling of what Team Galactic\nis trying to achieve!\c\nOf course, they don’t tell a grunt like me\nanything, either... But still!
1-GINGAM_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	This is why I’m gonna be stuck as a\ngrunt forever...
1-GINGAM_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	If only I had some decent Pokémon...
1-RIVAL_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_FIRST_DAMAGE	Don’t get cocky, kid! This isn’t over yet!
1-RIVAL_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_HP_HALF	My Pokémon’s HP is low... This could be a\nbit tight.
1-RIVAL_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What just happened? I lost?!
1-RIVAL_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_FIRST_DAMAGE	Don’t get cocky, kid! This isn’t over yet!
1-RIVAL_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_HP_HALF	My Pokémon’s HP is low... This could be a\nbit tight.
1-RIVAL_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What just happened? I lost?!
1-COLLECTOR_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We were having a heated discussion over\nPokémon the way collectors do.
1-COLLECTOR_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Knowledge alone isn’t everything, you know...
1-COLLECTOR_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m more knowledgeable than the rest when it\ncomes to collecting. I have rare Pokémon!\c\nBut a collector doesn’t make a good\nbattler, necessarily...
1-COLLECTOR_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m a collector, and I’m proud of what I know\nabout Pokémon.\c\nWould you like me to test your knowledge?
1-COLLECTOR_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That’s some knowledge you have there!
1-COLLECTOR_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I don’t like people who are more knowledgeable\nthan me! Go away!
1-WAITRESS_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Welcome! This Pokémon is my pride and joy!
1-WAITRESS_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I take losses with an unusually big smile! Do you\nfind that odd at all?
1-WAITRESS_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	After a match, you should have some Moomoo\nMilk to quench your thirst!\c\nJust chug it right down!\n*glug glug*
1-LEADER2_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	It’s not the end yet.
1-LEADER2_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	Are you saying something? You think you have\nme cornered?
1-LEADER2_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Amazing! You’re very good, aren’t you?
1-SISTER_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	*giggle*\nYou found me! Of course I’ll battle you!
1-SISTER_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Aww, boo! Look—you’ve beaten me!
1-SISTER_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	*giggle*\nThere’s only our Gym Leader left. Go on—\r\ndon’t be afraid!
1-MINI_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	A forest inside a Gym... Shocking, isn’t it?
1-MINI_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I was going to beat you while you were still in a\nstate of shock...
1-MINI_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	OK, the next Trainer is at the end, past\ntwo boulders.
1-AROMA_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My Grass-type Pokémon can dole out some\nserious special attacks.\c\nI won’t let you win easily!
1-AROMA_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The more beautiful a flower, the faster\nit withers...
1-AROMA_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Oh, that’s right... A hint about the next Trainer...\c\nIn the middle of three trees. That’s it for my hint.\nGood luck!
1-AROMA_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Even concealed, there is no hiding the aroma\nof flowers.
1-AROMA_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Just like your inability to conceal your\nabundant skill.
1-AROMA_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Your next opponent is under four flowers.
1-LEADER3_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	Hey! That there! That was a good move!
1-LEADER3_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	This is where it gets exciting!
1-LEADER3_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hunwah! It’s gone and ended!\c\nHow will I say this... I want more! I wanted to\nbattle a lot more!
1-FISHING_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve landed the most fish Pokémon in the world.\nI’m next!
1-FISHING_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Being number one in the world doesn’t mean\na thing...
1-FISHING_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I figure I got too wrapped up in fishing and\nneglected training.
1-FISHING_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I have mastery over the incredible power of\nwater. You won’t win!
1-FISHING_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	But the kid wins anyway! I’m just bowled over!
1-FISHING_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The water rising and falling is tricky, but don’t let\nit annoy you.\c\nIf you lose sight of yourself, that’s when you’re\nset to lose.
1-SAILOR_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve traveled all over the globe while\nraising Pokémon.\c\nThis is the Gym I’ve chosen. You’ll find it a\nhandful for sure!
1-SAILOR_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You! You’re a kind of top-class tough!
1-SAILOR_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If you were to go around the world, I’m sure\nyou’d meet tougher Pokémon.
1-SAILOR_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Like the raging sea, I crash down and wash away\neverything before me! That’s just how I roll!
1-SAILOR_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That wave didn’t even wash my hands...
1-SAILOR_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m now becalmed like a waveless sea...
1-UKIWAB_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My body isn’t the only thing I work on\ntoughening up here.\c\nI also work on my Pokémon and my spirit!
1-UKIWAB_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wow, Trainer! You just might be tougher than our\nGym Leader!
1-UKIWAB_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Maybe I’ll do like Wake—I mean, Crasher\nWake—and wear the same kind of mask.
1-UKIWAG_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I want to become a strong Trainer like\nCrasher Wake!
1-UKIWAG_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	*groan*\nYou’re too much.
1-UKIWAG_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Maybe I’ll do like Wake—I mean, Crasher\nWake—and use the same kinds of Pokémon.
1-LEADER4_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	Oh! But this isn’t the end, my friend!
1-LEADER4_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	I’m in a bit of a bind, aren’t I?
1-LEADER4_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I shall admit defeat... You are much too strong.
1-KARATE_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We’re the Karate Quads!\c\nI will strike a blow for love with my fist!\nHiyah, looooooooove!
1-KARATE_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Argh! Crunched!
1-KARATE_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Your Pokémon sure are tough!\c\nBut our Gym Leader Maylene will break you like\na stack of bricks!
1-KARATE_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We’re the Karate Quads!\c\nI will strike a blow for courage with my fist!\nHiyah, couraaaaaaaaaaage!
1-KARATE_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I couldn’t force my way to victory...
1-KARATE_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	To overwhelm by force... That is my ideal\nbeatdown style.\c\nIt doesn’t seem to work that way with\nPokémon, however.
1-KARATE_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We’re the Karate Quads!\c\nI will strike a blow for hope with my fist!\nHiyah, hoooooooooooooope!
1-KARATE_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	We came up short but not by much.
1-KARATE_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ll have to redo my training, though.\nMaylene’s gonna trample me again...
1-KARATE_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We’re the Karate Quads!\c\nI will strike a blow for tears with my fist!\nHiyah, teeeeeeaaaaaaaaars!
1-KARATE_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m so hungry, kid... I don’t have any\nstrength left...
1-KARATE_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I lost because I didn’t eat enough pizza.\c\nNo. Anything I say will sound like I’m\nmaking excuses.
1-LEADER5_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	Oh, heavens. What is this? Is this my\nfinal Pokémon?
1-LEADER5_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	Never give up—no matter what!
1-LEADER5_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You are so fantastically strong. I know now why I\nhave lost.
1-CAMPB_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve been to all sorts of places. That means I\nknow tons of things!
1-CAMPB_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Yeah, whatever. You can battle, too...
1-CAMPB_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m gonna visit new places and find new Pokémon\nso I’ll be a know-it-all!
1-ELITEM_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Seriously, kid, why don’t you answer the quiz\nproperly? You could get to the Gym Leader\r\nwithout a problem! Waste of my time.\r\nNow I gotta knock you around a bit.
1-ELITEM_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I kinda deserved that, didn’t I? I gotta stop\nmouthing off like that...
1-ELITEM_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ll remember you and your shifty Pokémon, too.\nI’m watching you...
1-ELITEW_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Ooh, ooh! You want to battle me? OK then,\nI’ll do the best I can!
1-ELITEW_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I squeezed out all my power... You’re one\nimpressive challenger.
1-ELITEW_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Look at it this way: you can learn something from\nevery battle.
1-MINI_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Ehehe! You threw the quiz so you’d get to battle\nwith me, right?
1-MINI_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Don’t you know how to take it easy or\nanything? Geesh!
1-MINI_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Since you’re here, you might as well take on\nevery Trainer.
1-PICNICG_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m not afraid of picnicking anywhere, so I’ve\nlearned all sorts of things.
1-PICNICG_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your toughness... It’s something new to me.
1-PICNICG_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ve learned that Pokémon are fun ’cause\neveryone plays with ’em!
1-SCHOOLB_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I study subjects like Pokémon and history...\nYou know, all the important things!
1-SCHOOLB_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, what in the—? I didn’t study enough?
1-SCHOOLB_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You won because of Pokémon type matchups,\ncool tactics...\c\nYou know, all sorts of reasons!
1-SCHOOLG_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve probably studied more about Pokémon\nthan you.
1-SCHOOLG_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, you! I feel bad that I’m so angry!
1-SCHOOLG_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m going over the reasons why I lost. That way,\nI’ll win next time.
1-TANPAN_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Don’t you have a Pokétch? Or did you\nscrew up deliberately?
1-TANPAN_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Gwaaah! I was done in!
1-TANPAN_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You’ll have to turn back, though. This is a\ndead end.
1-LEADER6_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	I’m going to break the ice and bring out my\nlast-resort Pokémon!
1-LEADER6_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	I can sense your will to win, but I promise you I’m\nnot about to lose!
1-LEADER6_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I must say, I’ve warmed up to you! I might even\nadmire you a little.
1-COLDELITEM_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	It’s t-too cold. I can’t even feel my t-tongue.
1-COLDELITEM_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	This result... It’s cold. Bitter cold.
1-COLDELITEM_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The higher up you slide from, the more speed\nyou’ll have to smash those big snowballs.
1-COLDELITEM_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My willpower was shaped and tempered by\nhowling blizzards. I’ll bring it to bear on you!
1-COLDELITEM_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You weren’t even fazed...
1-COLDELITEM_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ve battled countless Trainers and many more\nPokémon still.\c\nMy spirit has been hardened from all the battles\nI have fared.
1-COLDELITEW_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Is the Gym’s trick floor making you a little hot\nunder the collar?\c\nIf you can’t maintain your cool in battle, you’ll\nfreeze up.
1-COLDELITEW_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You were surprisingly cool... At least I have my\nwarm boots.
1-COLDELITEW_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Your Pokémon [VAR 1301(-001)] so caught up in the heat of\nbattle. [VAR 1301(-001)] so hot, [VAR 1301(-001)] cool! Hahah!
1-COLDELITEW_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Are you feeling the chill of fatigue?\c\nA good Trainer goes for the win no matter what\ntheir condition is!
1-COLDELITEW_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That’s right. A good Trainer will win, no matter\nwhat the situation may be.
1-COLDELITEW_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The Trainer’s feelings... The Pokémon’s feelings...\c\nIf they are one and the same, you will never lose.
1-LEADER8_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	Here it comes! Get ready for my trump card!
1-LEADER8_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	Shocking... I didn’t see this coming!
1-LEADER8_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’ve got me beat. Your desire and the noble\nway your Pokémon battled for you...\c\nI even felt thrilled during our match. That was a\nvery good battle.
1-ELITEM_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Wow! I’m surprised you’ve come this far,\nbut you’ll have to turn back.\c\nThere isn’t any chance that you could ever\nbeat me!
1-ELITEM_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What makes your Pokémon so special?
1-ELITEM_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	As a challenger, you’re one tough Trainer.
1-ELITEW_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m not just looking for tough Trainers to battle.\nI’ve been battling here because I want to feel\r\nthe rush!
1-ELITEW_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your power is so shocking, it’s made me\ngo numb.
1-ELITEW_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m so glad there are Pokémon! There isn’t much\nelse that gives me the thrill that Pokémon do!
1-GUITARIST_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I want to win! I channel that desire through\nmy guitar!\c\nI want to win! That desire makes my Pokémon\na star!
1-GUITARIST_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	We couldn’t win... No encores for us...
1-GUITARIST_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The Trainer’s desire to win! If you don’t lose that,\nthere’s no limit on what you can become!
1-GUITARIST_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Spark!\c\nThis is what our Gym Leader did to the Gym out\nof boredom!
1-GUITARIST_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Spark...
1-GUITARIST_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	We were lacking energy...\c\nNo, we lacked more than that. We didn’t want\nthe win enough.
1-GUITARIST_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Whether you’re a Trainer or a guitarist, it takes\ndedication to improve your mad skills!
1-GUITARIST_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My skills seem to have let me down. I must have\nbeen out of tune!
1-GUITARIST_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The way you battle, I can feel the very heart of\nrock and roll.\c\nTell me—are you maybe a fan of rocking out?
1-POKEGIRL_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Look at the way I’m dressed. Can’t you see that\nI’m hard-core?
1-POKEGIRL_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I was being serious! Don’t laugh at me! I mean it!
1-POKEGIRL_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I dress this way so I can learn to think like an\nElectric-type Pokémon.\c\nWhy don’t you give it a try?
1-SCHOOLB_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	This is the toughest Gym in Sinnoh.\c\nThat’s why I’m here—to learn the best battle\ntechniques around!
1-SCHOOLB_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re tough.
1-SCHOOLB_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You just showed me that there’s still lots I need\nto learn. The world of Pokémon is deep!
1-SCHOOLG_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Can you make it to the Gym Leader?\nYou sure now?
1-SCHOOLG_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The gears spin round and round... I spin down\nand out...
1-SCHOOLG_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Our Gym’s trick walkways are sure to make your\nhead spin!
1-DRAGON_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My dragon Pokémon chose to become powerful\nhere. They sure like it!
1-DRAGON_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your battle style...
1-DRAGON_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It’s been several years since I left the\nDragon’s Den.\c\nI’ve got to say, your Pokémon [VAR 1301(-001)] in the top class\nfor toughness.
1-DRAGON_05_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	My dragon Pokémon chose to remain here to\nbecome powerful.
1-ELITEM_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	There’s something about you... You’re not just\nanybody. I challenge you!
1-ELITEM_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re at a different level of expertise, for sure!
1-ELITEM_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You’ve won countless times... That has made you\nvery powerful.
1-ELITEM_10_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	There’s something about you... You still remain\nextraordinary. I challenge you again!
1-ELITEW_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I constantly analyze Pokémon and various battles\non my laptop.
1-ELITEW_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Things don’t always work out according to\nmy calculations...
1-ELITEW_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I had a lot of fun battling with you, though.\c\nI wonder if I can analyze the battle\ndata properly.\c\nI could use a rematch to get some\nadditional data.
1-ELITEW_10_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I analyzed our last battle on my laptop.
1-ESPM_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	For some reason I was drawn here, and it is here\nthat I met you...\c\nI want to know what all this means!
1-ESPM_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I see... So that’s what it means...
1-ESPM_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I feel... I feel some sort of a mystic\npresence emanating from here...
1-ESPM_05_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Why have you come back to this spot? I want to\nknow what all this means!
1-ESPW_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	There is nothing here... And yet there is a\npower lurking...\c\nWere you drawn by it as well?
1-ESPW_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The power that slumbers within you... It is rather\nmarvelous indeed...
1-ESPW_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	A place where nothing else exists...\c\nA place such as that is better suited to awaken\nthe power within.
1-ESPW_05_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	See? You’ve come back again.\c\nThere must be something that draws you here...
1-ISEKI_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I don’t care who you are—no one interferes with\nmy treasure hunting!
1-ISEKI_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My treasure! My Pokémon!
1-ISEKI_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I heard there’s an intriguing stone monument\naround, so I came running.
1-ISEKI_05_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’m still here...and still searching for treasures.\c\nHowever, a battle with you is a treasure I can’t\npass up!
1-KARATE_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	A man standing alone, I face the sea and train.\nThese fists were hewn in that way!
1-KARATE_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My training and my fists weren’t enough to\ndefeat you!
1-KARATE_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Argh! Instead of training myself, I should have\ntrained my Pokémon!\c\nAll I’ve been doing for the last year is staring out\nover the sea!
1-KARATE_15_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Ah, it’s been a long time!\c\nI have been toughening my fists against the sea,\njust as before!
1-VETERAN_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve seen countless Trainers and even more\nPokémon! So, what kind of a Trainer are you?
1-VETERAN_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I see... Simply outstanding.
1-VETERAN_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ve seen countless Trainers and even more\nPokémon. You’re a strong Trainer. Moreover,\r\nyour heart is strong.
1-VETERAN_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I am indeed a Veteran, but I don’t use that as an\nexcuse to slack off.\c\nI take pride in challenging those who have\nbested me before!
1-IDOL_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ll let you join my fan club if you can beat me!
1-IDOL_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Ouch! Are you one of those crazy fans? You sure\nare rowdy!
1-IDOL_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Well, that’s me and my Pokémon! Thank you for\nbeing such a fan!\c\nJust so you know, our latest single is called\n“Jigglin’ Pokémon Wub”!
1-CAMERAMAN_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve spotted a charismatic Trainer! We just might\nhave a scoop here!
1-CAMERAMAN_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My camera’s too heavy. I couldn’t\nbattle effectively...
1-CAMERAMAN_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The lively expressions on you and your\nPokémon’s faces make for some great TV!
1-GUITARIST_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Your spirit’s giving off some seriously cool vibes...\nI can tell that you totally rock!
1-GUITARIST_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You beat me, but...I feel totally amped to\njam harder!
1-GUITARIST_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Rock is about your spirit! Battling is about spirit,\ntoo! That’s why battles rock! Rawk!
1-INTERVIEW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_1	You’re live on camera, but try to act natural, OK?
1-INTERVIEW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_1	The camera is our witness! It’s recorded\nour defeat...
1-INTERVIEW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_1	I’d like to take that footage and have it\nbroadcast worldwide.
1-INTERVIEW_01_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_1	Two Pokémon! If you had two Pokémon, we’d get\na great shot here.
1-INTERVIEW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_2	So, let’s begin and find out what sort of a Trainer\nyou are!
1-INTERVIEW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_2	You have a superstar quality! You sure could\nbecome a celebrity!
1-INTERVIEW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_2	I lost, but I’m totally thrilled! We just made some\ngreat TV!
1-INTERVIEW_01_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_2	Oh, no. What we really want to see is you in\naction with two Pokémon!
1-PIERROT_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Are we all ready to have some fun? I sure am!\nAren’t you having fun?! Let’s make it fun!\r\nOK?! Mwahahah!
1-PIERROT_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, no, no, no! Mwahahah?
1-PIERROT_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	A clown’s makeup is a face that’s crying while\nlaughing. It defines what we do!
1-POKEGIRL_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Po! Po! Pokémon!\c\nHeh, did you think I was a real Pokémon?
1-POKEGIRL_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Pikachu!
1-POKEGIRL_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I need to get more into the character of\na Pokémon...
1-REPORTER_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Join me in this on-the-spot report, live at the\nscene of a battle!
1-REPORTER_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The media is the victim!
1-REPORTER_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Interviews are about taking the initiative.
1-GINGAM_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	How is this madness possible? The two of us,\nlosing to children?
1-GINGAM_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	This won’t do... Time to retreat. This mission is\na failure.
1-GINGALEADER2_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_FIRST_DAMAGE	How insolent. Take a bite of this, child!
1-GINGALEADER2_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Losing to some child... Being careless cost me\ntoo much.
1-GINGAM_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We are gathering Pokémon for an astonishing\nundertaking! Your meddling won’t be tolerated!
1-GINGAM_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I feel like I got meddled with...
1-GINGAM_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Our astonishing undertaking is most certainly\nbreathtaking. If you ever hope to see its glorious\r\nunveiling, then don’t meddle with us!
1-GINGAM_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Our objectives are incredible—too incredible for\nme to understand!\c\nI’ll fight blindly to defend them, and your\nintrusion won’t be forgiven!
1-GINGAM_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What was I fighting for again?
1-GINGAM_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	What do you have against taking Pokémon from\nothers? Look in any field or forest! Those things\r\naren’t exactly rare!
1-GINGAW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Sorry, deary! Team Galactic doesn’t accept\nchildren as members!
1-GINGAW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	B-but, deary, you’re just a kid!
1-GINGAW_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You wanted to go up? Well, why didn’t you?
1-GINGAW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Let’s see how good this Pokémon is! I stole it\nfrom some weak Trainer.
1-GINGAW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What is this?!
1-GINGAW_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Wimpy little Pokémon...\c\nWhen I get promoted, I’ll demand better\nstolen Pokémon.
1-GINGAW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Why, thank you!\c\nWe love it when people come to us to donate\ntheir Pokémon!
1-GINGAW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What do you think you’re doing?!
1-GINGAW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You can catch Pokémon anywhere. What’s so\nspecial about them?\c\nTrainers that lose theirs should quit whining and\ncatch some more!
1-ISEKI_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	This place is teeming with Unown... There has to\nbe some meaning to this.\c\nThe truth can be found. I’ll start my search by\nbattling you!
1-ISEKI_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The search must continue!
1-ISEKI_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I give up. I’m not going to rack my brain over the\nmeaning of this place.
1-DAISUKIM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I can’t explain it... Being here compels me\nto battle!
1-DAISUKIM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hunh?! What was I just doing?!
1-DAISUKIM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Though they are gone, their desire to battle lives\non? The spirits of Pokémon still linger?\c\nIs that what it is?
1-DAISUKIW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I need to shake off my sorrow... Please, battle\nwith me!
1-DAISUKIW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My sorrow has deepened...
1-DAISUKIW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I won’t ever forget the time I spent with my\nPokémon...not even for a moment.
1-FAMILY_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_1	It makes no difference where we are. If you have\nPokémon with you, I reckon you ought to battle.
1-FAMILY_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_1	You’ve got a lot of giddyup and go in you!
1-FAMILY_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_1	Over a long life, you’ll be certain to have some\nsad farewells. But I reckon there are also some\r\nnew beginnings.
1-FAMILY_02_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_1	Hahaha! I’m afraid y’all are no match for us with\njus’ one of them Pokémon!
1-FAMILY_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_2	My Pokémon is a lively one. Lemme show you!
1-FAMILY_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_2	Well! Aren’t you the lively one!
1-FAMILY_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_2	Them graves here in Lost Tower... And right’n\nhere, inside my heart... Those are the places\r\nwhere my Pokémon remain...
1-FAMILY_02_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_2	You haven’t got yerself two Pokémon?
1-HEADS_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My Pokémon were taken from me...\nTeam Galactic did it...\c\nEver since, I’ve never forgiven their faces...
1-HEADS_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Gwaaaaaah!
1-HEADS_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m not doing my Pokémon any favors by ruining\nits memory like this...\c\nI can’t be wallowing around forever. I gotta move\non and turn the page.
1-LOVELOVE_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_1	I can’t embarrass myself again. Not in front of\nmy girlfriend!
1-LOVELOVE_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_1	Awww, jeez. That’s a downer...
1-LOVELOVE_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_1	Coming here again brings back all kinds of\nmemories of me and Nat.
1-LOVELOVE_05_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_1	You can’t battle with us. Not with one\nPokémon, anyway.
1-LOVELOVE_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START_2	I don’t want to look bad again. Not when my\nboyfriend is watching!
1-LOVELOVE_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE_2	This makes me feel hollow inside...\nOh so hollow...
1-LOVELOVE_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER_2	The Pokémon that brought me and Mike\ntogether is buried here...
1-LOVELOVE_05_TRMSG_POKE_ONE_2	You do have at least two Pokémon, don’t you?
1-TANPAN_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Waaah! Ghost! Get away! Eek! Help me, team!
1-TANPAN_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hey... You’re no ghost...
1-TANPAN_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I had to come here because I lost a dare with\nsome kids at school.\c\nThe loser had to go to the top and bring back\nthe TM for Strength.
1-BATTLEG_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Beating you would be my hundredth straight win!\nHere’s to a fun battle!
1-BATTLEG_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You don’t know how frustrating it is to lose now,\nafter all that work!
1-BATTLEG_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I wish I could beat Maylene in Veilstone City\none day...
1-CAMPB_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Yeah, I like to camp! So what? Let’s battle!
1-CAMPB_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I should’ve just stuck to camping out here...
1-CAMPB_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	When I’m with my Pokémon, I can camp just\nabout anywhere I want!
1-ELITEM_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	If we battle here, your Pokémon will become\nstronger, and so will mine.\c\nThat’s a good thing for both of us. What’s not to\nlike? Let’s throw down!
1-ELITEM_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You know, I would have really enjoyed a win\nthere. Would’ve been real nice.
1-ELITEM_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	This mine’s been abandoned, but now it’s home\nto many Pokémon. I guess everything finds a\r\nplace to call home someday...
1-ELITEW_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Tough Pokémon... Tough Trainers...\c\nYou tell me—where else can I find a place as\ngood as this to train?
1-ELITEW_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That was good. You’ve bonded well with\nyour Pokémon.
1-ELITEW_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Tough Pokémon... Tough Trainers...\c\nA strong spirit and a tight bond... There is so\nmuch to train for.
1-KARATE_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ll pound the fear of my fists into you all karate\nstyle, punk!
1-KARATE_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m so sorry... I got a bit mouthy there, didn’t I?
1-KARATE_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	So, I’m gonna try and shatter steel!\c\nI wonder how many more years it would take for\nme to do that?
1-MOUNT_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Every good hiker gets a boost of energy when\nsurrounded by boulders!\c\nWrooooar! Coming at you! Let me blow off\nsome steam!
1-MOUNT_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Whew... I think I’ve calmed down now...
1-MOUNT_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If it’s called a mountain, you can be sure I’ll be\nclimbing it.\c\nEven if it’s a mountain of food, I’ll still be stickin’\nmy flag on top!
1-MOUNT_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	When you’re up in the mountains, a battle’d do\nfor a proper greeting!
1-MOUNT_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Yahoo!
1-MOUNT_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Actually, when you’re up in the mountains,\na simple hi’d do if you walk past someone.\c\nOh, and this isn’t the mountains.
1-PICNICG_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	May we have a battle, please?\c\nIt will be something to lighten up this boring\npicnic with.
1-PICNICG_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	We’re not going to win if we play around\nlike that...
1-PICNICG_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m going home to play with my Pokémon!
1-WORKER_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	The working-class hero says hi!
1-WORKER_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The working-class hero waves bye...
1-WORKER_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I used to work here a long time ago, before it\nshut down. I worked at the ironworks near\r\nFloaroma Town, too.\c\nYou might say I’m drawn to iron as if by magnet!
1-WORKER_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	While I’m making sure the lifts are safe, I’ll focus\non a battle with you!
1-WORKER_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	A-OK! Looks safe to me! Not a problem in sight!
1-WORKER_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I routinely check the lifts here. You can be sure\nof their safety!
1-WORKER_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hey! This is no playground! If you’re gonna play,\nbattle me!
1-WORKER_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You played me like an amateur!
1-WORKER_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	They were going to close this place up so no one\ncould get in. But they left it open so people and\r\nPokémon can get together here.
1-WORKER_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	The Canalave Gym folks use this place as their\ntraining grounds.
1-WORKER_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Maybe I should head to the Gym and work\nout there...
1-WORKER_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Roark spent his childhood playing here, I think...
1-CAMPB_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Humph! You’re lost, aren’t you? I’ll guide you if\nyou can beat me.
1-CAMPB_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I said I’m going to win!
1-CAMPB_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m not lost, I tell you! I’m camping!\nThat’s my story!
1-CAMPB_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Huh? Are you lost, too? No? It doesn’t matter.\nLet’s have a quick Pokémon battle!
1-CAMPB_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Not fair! We’re not on the same level!
1-CAMPB_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I got separated from my friends... I’ve got my\nPokémon with me, so I’m OK, but...
1-COLLECTOR_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You look like you might just have the Pokémon\nI’ve been looking for!
1-COLLECTOR_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You didn’t have a single Pokémon I wanted...\nYou’re no collector!
1-COLLECTOR_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m very picky, so I want to collect every\nPokémon without anyone’s help.\c\n...I do have friends, though. No, seriously! I do!
1-ISEKI_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	In deep tunnels and caves, there’re a couple\nthings you’re sure to see.\c\nZubat and Ruin Maniacs!
1-ISEKI_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your awesome power... It’s mystifying.
1-ISEKI_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ve scoured every inch of this place... Most of it\nwhile I was lost.\c\nAnyway, if there’s one thing I can say, this place\ncan’t be called ruins!
1-MINI_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hush now, lost little Pokémon. Don’t you cry.\nI’m here to take care of you!
1-MINI_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	*sniffle*\nWh-who’s crying now?
1-MINI_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Speaking of crying, I’m positive I heard crying\nfrom deeper in the cave.
1-MOUNT_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Look! A Trainer lost in Wayward Cave!
1-MOUNT_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I strayed from the battle plan!
1-MOUNT_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Me? No, I’m not lost. I live here!
1-MOUNT_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Wandering around, I got hungry, so I ate some\nwild mushrooms... They gave me gas, and now\r\nI can’t stop burping! Bluurrf!
1-MOUNT_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Bleff! Hurk! I think...I’m getting better...
1-MOUNT_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I hear there’s a Pokémon that has mushrooms\ngrowing on its back.\c\nNot around here—somewhere far away. I wonder\nif the mushrooms taste any good?
1-PICNICG_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Where am I? Am I lost? Who are you?\nAre you a Pokémon Trainer?
1-PICNICG_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	OK, so we’re both Trainers. That’s a start, right?
1-PICNICG_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I just wanted to have a picnic under\nCycling Road. I didn’t think I would get lost\r\nin a place like this...
1-PICNICG_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	What every good picnic needs is a cute setting,\ngood food, and a fun battle!
1-PICNICG_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That wasn’t any fun for me!
1-PICNICG_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Why have a picnic here? I don’t know.\nThere’s no deep meaning to it.
1-TANPAN_17_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Did you come to play, too? Wanna play battle\nwith me?
1-TANPAN_17_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You were just toying with me!
1-TANPAN_17_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’m playing hide-and-seek here. I like some\nunderground tag, too.
1-BIRD_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	The sharp vision of my bird Pokémon will see\nthrough your weaknesses!
1-BIRD_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Don’t you have an Achilles’ heel?
1-BIRD_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I want to become stronger but only with my\nfavorite Pokémon.
1-DRAGON_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Learning how to manage tough Pokémon is the\nshortcut to getting tough.
1-DRAGON_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I lost? But how is that possible?!
1-DRAGON_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Being able to manage any kind of Pokémon...\nI suppose that makes a good Trainer.
1-ELITEM_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Being this tough isn’t good enough. You have to\nlook cool while doing it.\c\nMastering that makes you an ace!
1-ELITEM_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Made me look bad...
1-ELITEM_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I battled the best I could. I wasn’t uncool in\nlosing! ...Right?
1-ELITEM_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I want my Pokémon to get a taste of the\nsweetness that is victory.\c\nI can’t afford to lose this one!
1-ELITEM_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	This defeat has the tang of my bitter tears...
1-ELITEM_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I feel sorry for my hungry Pokémon...\c\nSorry, team. I’ll get tougher so you can feast on\nthe taste of victory...
1-ELITEW_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I will win. I am sure of it. Therefore, you will lose!
1-ELITEW_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	But... This isn’t possible!
1-ELITEW_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You didn’t win! I just lost! Oh, whatever. It’s the\nsame thing...
1-ELITEW_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Let me see what you got there, kid. I could give\nyou some advice.
1-ELITEW_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You got way too much!
1-ELITEW_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Well, I don’t have any advice for someone as\ntough as you!
1-ESPM_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Now we shall have a battle, and from it will\nemerge one loser...
1-ESPM_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh!
1-ESPM_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I can use psychic powers, but battling isn’t so\nsimple... It takes much more to win!
1-ESPM_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	A battle is a clash of willpower!\c\nThe one who wants the win the most will emerge\nthe victor!
1-ESPM_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	But...I thought I could win!
1-ESPM_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Psychic power...\c\nIt’s hard to put faith in something that you\ncan’t see...
1-ESPW_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Allow me to demonstrate how a true psychic\nconducts a battle!
1-ESPW_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Did I get to show you anything? Anything at all?
1-ESPW_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	How do I use my psychic powers?\c\nI never use them for dishonest ends. I also never\ndo any good deeds...
1-ESPW_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I see it! I see a victory for me!
1-ESPW_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The future...is different! Why?!
1-ESPW_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Your efforts have altered the very path of\nthe future!
1-KARATE_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I trained all of my gnarly Pokémon at the\nFighting Dojo in Kanto!
1-KARATE_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Totally done for!
1-KARATE_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	We’re gonna go ahead and leave... You know,\ngo train elsewhere.
1-KARATE_20_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Judo chop! Pokémon battle!
1-KARATE_20_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wrroar! Judo chop defeated!
1-KARATE_20_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ll forget that we lost!\c\nWait—if I did that, we’d never learn from\nour mistakes...
1-VETERAN_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	What it means to battle... Its joys, its sorrows...\nI’ve experienced it all!
1-VETERAN_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My sorrow deepens...
1-VETERAN_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You may be a child, but you’ve taught me a\nwhole lot. I thank you humbly.
1-VETERAN_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ll wheel out some wicked Pokémon and even\nwickeder moves!
1-VETERAN_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	All I can manage now is to wheeze out a few\nmeek sighs...
1-VETERAN_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I don’t see what my age has to do with playing\nwith Pokémon, frankly.
1-BIRD_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I let my bird Pokémon carry me to wherever.\nAnd so, here I am!
1-BIRD_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Sheesh... I arrive in a new place and it turns out\nto be the Battle Zone...
1-BIRD_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I was born in the Hoenn region. I’ve only just\nrecently flown here.
1-BIRD_07_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I let my bird Pokémon do as they wish. And so,\nwe train here daily!
1-BIRD_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My Pokémon grew up in the arms of Mother\nNature. They’re tough!
1-BIRD_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	How could you be tougher than Mother Nature?
1-BIRD_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Most of the time, my Pokémon return to their\nPoké Balls right away.\c\nBut sometimes, they just fall asleep on top of my\nhead. That gets messy.
1-BIRD_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	The desire to win... That should be evident in\nevery Trainer!
1-DRAGON_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	The potential of dragon Pokémon puts them at\nthe top of my list!
1-DRAGON_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Potential doesn’t mean I can win...
1-DRAGON_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	A Dragon Tamer Champion... I’ll need to train so\nmuch more to even come close to coming close...
1-DRAGON_07_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I cranked up my dragon Pokémon’s potential!\nI’ve been looking forward to seeing you again!
1-DRAGON_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	What my Pokémon and I most want: victory!
1-DRAGON_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Arrrgh! My Gyarados...
1-DRAGON_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I don’t ever want to put my Pokémon through\nthat again...\c\nIt got humiliated because I wasn’t good enough...
1-DRAGON_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	You’ve beaten us before, but we won’t make the\nsame mistake!
1-DRAGON_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Dragon Pokémon are sacred beings... That’s what\nmy master taught me.\c\nAnd now I’ll prove it to you!
1-DRAGON_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Not good enough! We’re still not strong enough!
1-DRAGON_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It’s not good enough for a Pokémon to just be\ntough. It’s not good enough for a Trainer to just\r\nwork hard. Both have to grow together!
1-DRAGON_09_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	This time, I’ll show you how brilliantly I work with\nmy Pokémon partner!
1-DRAGON_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	How do you do? I’m a Dragon Tamer. What say\nwe compare our Pokémon by means of a battle?
1-DRAGON_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oops! How very silly of me!
1-DRAGON_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Well, there seems to be an image associated\nwith Dragon Tamers. But personally, I’m really\r\nlaid back and easygoing, you know?\c\nI figure there’s a whole lot of other things I need\nto worry about first.
1-DRAGON_10_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Heya, how do you do again? What say we let our\nPokémon duke it out in another battle?
1-ELITEM_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	There is something missing in the way I battle...\nI’ve come here to find it.
1-ELITEM_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I see it now... I know what I lack.
1-ELITEM_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It’s been a privilege to have battled with you.\nI learned an invaluable lesson from you today.
1-ELITEM_15_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’ve discovered what’s missing from my battles—\nHave you discovered what’s missing from yours?
1-ELITEM_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve got the urge to battle with you. I hope\nyou’re willing to oblige!
1-ELITEM_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I shouldn’t have paid attention to my urge...
1-ELITEM_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	So long as my partner’s alongside me, I’m willing\nto take on the world!
1-ELITEM_16_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	The urge to battle you again has struck me.\nWant to humor me?
1-ELITEM_17_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Have you any knowledge of levels or the stats of\nPokémon? Well, I do!
1-ELITEM_17_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hmm. I like how you attack.
1-ELITEM_17_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Pokémon levels and stats... Who cares about\nthat stuff?\c\nWinning is what’s important.\nNumbers aren’t everything.
1-ELITEM_17_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Pokémon battles aren’t decided by numbers.\c\nThe decisive factor is the bond you share with\nyour Pokémon!
1-ELITEM_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Welcome to my Pokémon show!
1-ELITEM_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Did you enjoy the show? Super fabulous,\nwasn’t it?
1-ELITEM_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ll be happy to battle you again! Let’s battle\nagain sometime, yeah?
1-ELITEM_18_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Welcome to my new Pokémon show!
1-ELITEM_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My team’s been trained through and through!\nYou’ll shake when you see how tough they are!
1-ELITEM_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m sh-sh-shaking all over...
1-ELITEM_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I fed my gang Protein, Carbos... You name it,\nI pumped ’em full of it.
1-ELITEM_19_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hey, you’re that Trainer who left me all shook up!\nUh-huh!\c\nThis time, it’s my turn to leave you shaking\nall over!
1-ELITEM_20_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My partner and I have come this far. Let me show\nyou how much it’s grown!
1-ELITEM_20_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	It needs to grow more?!
1-ELITEM_20_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	My Pokémon... It’s actually the very first friend\nthat I’ve ever had.
1-ELITEM_20_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	When I close my eyes, I’m taken back to that\ntime we lost to you.\c\nMy partner’s grown even more since then.\nI’ll prove it to you!
1-ELITEW_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Worthy opponents... The search for them drives\nme to travel far.
1-ELITEW_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’ve certainly found a tough adversary in you...
1-ELITEW_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	How much you believe in your Pokémon—\nthat’s a critical factor in how a battle will\r\nturn out.
1-ELITEW_16_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	We’ve faced many challengers since we met,\nbut they were all weak...\c\nI relish the tough resistance that only you\ncan provide!
1-ELITEW_17_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Please don’t hold anything back.
1-ELITEW_17_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hmm...
1-ELITEW_17_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I feel invigorated from that battle, even though\nwe lost. After all, we gave it everything we had.
1-ELITEW_17_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hello again! Please don’t hold anything back—\njust like before.
1-ELITEW_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You’re willing to battle? Let me see what kind of\nPokémon you have.
1-ELITEW_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your love of Pokémon really shows!
1-ELITEW_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I grew up together with my team, right from\nmy childhood.\c\nAll our memories, we’ve always shared them.
1-ELITEW_18_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Oh, hi, we meet again. May I see what you’ve\ndone with your Pokémon?
1-ELITEW_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	The world is huge, and there are so many\ndifferent Pokémon!\c\nWhat kinds of Pokémon are with you? Please,\nI want to have a look!
1-ELITEW_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wow, there really are Pokémon that wonderful!
1-ELITEW_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	There is always something to like about\nany Pokémon.\c\nIt’s so hard to decide which ones I should raise.
1-ELITEW_19_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	If I’m having trouble deciding, I go with\nmy favorites!
1-ELITEW_20_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	What sort of moves have you taught? That tells\nme how good you are!
1-ELITEW_20_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Yowch!
1-ELITEW_20_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I heard that somewhere, there’s someone who\nteaches Pokémon moves.
1-ELITEW_20_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Have you taught your team any new moves since\nlast time?
1-ELITEW_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	When eyes meet... That’s when a battle starts!
1-ELITEW_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You won’t let me win?
1-ELITEW_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I suddenly remembered what it was like when I\nhad my first battle. I wonder why that would be?
1-ELITEW_21_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	When eyes meet... That’s when a battle starts!\nThat’s what makes us Trainers!
1-ESPM_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You’re going to win! That’s the future I saw!
1-ESPM_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What I saw in the future turned out to be true...
1-ESPM_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I lost, but my vision of the future came true...
1-ESPM_09_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	You’re going to win again! That’s the future I saw!
1-ESPW_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Right after this, you will send out Pokémon to\nbattle me!
1-ESPW_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Right after this, I have to pay out your\nprize money...
1-ESPW_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	What will happen to you after this? Why don’t\nyou do just as you like? It would be more fun\r\nthat way.
1-ESPW_09_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Right after this, you will hurl a Poké Ball in an\nastonishingly cool way!
1-KARATE_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My quest for power brought me here. It was\nbeneath the desert sand that I toughened\r\nmy body and soul.\c\nAccept my challenge! Uraah!
1-KARATE_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My spirit is broken...
1-KARATE_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I thought I couldn’t win before it became a fact...\c\nI’ve let down my Pokémon... They go to battle\nwith faith in their Trainer...
1-KARATE_21_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	This time—this time I will win! My spirit is\nrenewed and strong!
1-KARATE_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I have meditated under a waterfall to temper my\nspirit. Allow me to demonstrate its strength!
1-KARATE_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Ha-choo! *sniffle*
1-KARATE_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	All that time under the waterfall... Seems I’ve\ncaught a cold.
1-KARATE_22_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Since the day I lost to you, I’ve meditated under\na waterfall!
1-RANGERM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	People! Nature! Pokémon! Harmony is essential!
1-RANGERM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re A-OK!
1-RANGERM_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Protecting Pokémon and nature. Think of what\nthat means.
1-RANGERM_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Do you remember my slogan?\nPeople! Nature! Pokémon!\c\nThat’s right. Harmony is essential!
1-RANGERM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I work to protect beautiful, natural environments.\c\nMy Pokémon are my constant companions while\nI work.
1-RANGERM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh my gosh! My poor Pokémon!
1-RANGERM_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Everyone can do their part to keep nature clean.\nIt doesn’t take much.
1-RANGERM_04_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’m on patrol in pristine nature with my Pokémon\nlike usual.\c\nCome to think of it, you’re always with\nPokémon, too.
1-RANGERM_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We go on patrol to make sure there’s nothing\nstrange going on. And occasionally, we battle!
1-RANGERM_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Thanks much!
1-RANGERM_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You know that Pokémon Ability, Pickup? I think\nthat’s a good way of keeping the environment\r\nclean of litter.
1-RANGERM_05_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Patrols day in and day out! And the\noccasional battle!
1-RANGERW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	In the embrace of Mother Nature, people and\nPokémon grow strong!
1-RANGERW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My, you are tough.
1-RANGERW_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You can grow strong anywhere. It doesn’t matter\nwhere you are.
1-RANGERW_03_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	By battling tough opponents, both people and\nPokémon grow tough!
1-RANGERW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We’ve grown strong together in nature and in the\nconcrete jungle.\c\nWe make everywhere we go our playground!
1-RANGERW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re fantastically tough, aren’t you?!
1-RANGERW_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Look around you at this wildly contorted terrain.\c\nIt’s no wonder that Pokémon would grow tough\nin a place like this.
1-RANGERW_04_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I think I’m pretty tough, but so are you and\nyour Pokémon.\c\nLet’s have a battle to see who is the toughest!
1-RANGERW_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Are you getting worn out from all the running\nyou’ve done?
1-RANGERW_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re not tired at all?!
1-RANGERW_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The world is full of Pokémon and all sorts\nof Trainers.
1-RANGERW_05_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	What do you think of the Battle Zone?\c\nYou’ve met so many Pokémon... I’ve got to battle\nyou again!
1-SWIMMERM_20_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	A Trainer riding a Pokémon! I like that!\nWe’ve gotta battle!
1-SWIMMERM_20_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Awesome! You’re a real wild child!
1-SWIMMERM_20_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Riding the waves on a Pokémon’s back...\nYeah, that’s something to talk about, all right.
1-SWIMMERM_20_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Yo, Pokémon-riding Trainer! How about\na rematch?
1-SWIMMERM_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Check out my physique! The rough seas sculpted\nthis awesome body!
1-SWIMMERM_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Muscles I have plenty of... But let’s not talk\nabout strength.
1-SWIMMERM_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You’ve got wild Pokémon using a hidden move\nfor you... I find that really moving.
1-SWIMMERM_21_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	The rough seas here almost drowned—wait, no,\nshaped my physique! See how buff it is!
1-SWIMMERM_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Check out my dynamic form! Victory is assured!
1-SWIMMERM_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh. That’s how it is.
1-SWIMMERM_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Being a good swimmer doesn’t make me any\nbetter as a Trainer...
1-SWIMMERM_22_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hi! You’re that kid who’s great with Pokémon!\c\nI’ll battle with an even more dynamic form than\nbefore! Watch me now!
1-SWIMMERM_23_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My Pokémon and I are pumped up and ready\nto go all out!
1-SWIMMERM_23_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Our muscles are deflating...
1-SWIMMERM_23_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Overwhelm with our dazzling physiques!\nThat was our game plan...
1-SWIMMERM_23_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Me and my Pokémon are pumped up! See, our\nmuscles are twitching!
1-SWIMMERW_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	People keep coming to us for battles. I really\ndon’t know why! Teehee!
1-SWIMMERW_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	OK, we lost.
1-SWIMMERW_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I wanted to be alone, but after swatting away\nso many immature boys...\c\nWell, my Pokémon grew tough without me really\neven trying.
1-SWIMMERW_19_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	People still keep coming to us for battles! Why?!
1-SWIMMERW_20_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Are your Pokémon growing?
1-SWIMMERW_20_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Maybe they’re too grown up!
1-SWIMMERW_20_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I’ve grown with my Pokémon, too. We’re better\nswimmers now than ever!
1-SWIMMERW_20_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Did your Pokémon grow any more?\c\nHmm? My Pokémon? Mine are doing awesome!
1-SWIMMERW_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m a mermaid who drifts among the waves...\c\nBut I’m also a playful girl who likes to have fun\nwith Pokémon!
1-SWIMMERW_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Losing brings tears to my eyes...
1-SWIMMERW_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	A mermaid’s tears are so salty...
1-SWIMMERW_21_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I remain a mermaid who drifts among the waves...\c\nBut I’m also a playful girl who likes to have fun\nwith Pokémon!
1-SWIMMERW_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I want to be with my Water Pokémon.\nThat’s why I swim.
1-SWIMMERW_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	*glub glub*\nI’m going down!
1-SWIMMERW_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Everyone I know says they have to train harder\nand more often. I thought so too, but I find it\r\nhard to get that serious about it.\c\nBeing with my Pokémon puts me in a mellow\nmood, I guess.
1-SWIMMERW_22_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I want to be with my Water Pokémon.\nThat’s why I want to be stronger!
1-BIRD_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	With one mighty flap, my birds blow away the\nembers of aggression!
1-BIRD_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	We failed to get off the ground...
1-BIRD_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The hidden move Fly isn’t useful inside caves.\nIt’s such a shame.
1-DRAGON_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Dragons and a fiery mountain... It’s a totally\nclassic setup!
1-DRAGON_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Losing isn’t a happy occasion...
1-DRAGON_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	My Pokémon seem to like it here a lot.
1-DRAGON_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Are you seeking the Legendary Pokémon here,\ntoo? Let’s battle, then!
1-DRAGON_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’ve got nothing left...
1-DRAGON_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The Legendary Pokémon that sleeps deep in a\nvolcano... Could it be a dragon Pokémon?
1-ELITEM_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	What it means to win battles—that is what I seek.\nTeach me if you will!
1-ELITEM_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I grow less certain still...
1-ELITEM_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Perhaps there is no meaning to victory, but still\nI will battle! That is what makes me a Trainer!
1-ELITEM_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Being with Pokémon makes me happy. And when\nwe win, I feel happier still!
1-ELITEM_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	We’re still happy even when we lose!
1-ELITEM_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Raising Pokémon to the extremes... Having fun\nwith Pokémon...\c\nPeople should do whatever makes them happy.\nThat’s what I think!
1-ELITEM_23_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I was born in Floaroma Town. I’m sure thrilled to\nbe here.\c\nIt took a long time to get here. We’re not going\nto lose again!
1-ELITEM_23_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	We went down... We couldn’t stick it out...
1-ELITEM_23_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You can level all you want, but that won’t\nguarantee you any wins.\c\nBut we keep trying to get better. That’s what\nmakes us Trainers.
1-ELITEM_24_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	The Trainers and Pokémon that gather here aren’t\npushovers. They all have tricks up their sleeves!
1-ELITEM_24_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re not a Trainer that can be taken lightly!
1-ELITEM_24_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The Pokémon you’ll meet here won’t make it\neasy for you to move onward.
1-ELITEW_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You’ve come all this way for Pokémon? You must\nbe dedicated.
1-ELITEW_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your dedication won out.
1-ELITEW_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The Pokémon here must battle each other all the\ntime. That would explain why they are so strong.
1-ELITEW_23_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My Pokémon and I are pretty nice, but not when\nit comes to a battle!
1-ELITEW_23_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I couldn’t unleash the real me...
1-ELITEW_23_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	When you’re raising Pokémon, you need to be\nboth firm and gentle.
1-ELITEW_24_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I came here after winning my way through the\nBattle Tower!
1-ELITEW_24_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	But I had a win streak going...
1-ELITEW_24_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Train more at the Battle Tower... That’s what\nI’ll do.
1-ELITEW_25_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We’re all good to go! We just have to battle now!
1-ELITEW_25_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Aww... I’m out of useful items!
1-ELITEW_25_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	We came completely unprepared for this\nlittle adventure...
1-ESPM_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I had a revelation this morning. I knew that I\nwould have a wonderful encounter here today.
1-ESPM_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	There’s nothing wonderful about this!
1-ESPM_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Is my sense of premonition nothing to write\nhome about?
1-ESPW_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ll use my mystifying psychic powers to\npulverize you!
1-ESPW_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That’s what I get for making idle claims...
1-ESPW_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Psychic power is a mystery that defies\nexplanation. But if everything could be\r\nexplained, it would be a boring world.
1-KARATE_23_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	My Pokémon can destroy anything. And you think\nyou can win?!
1-KARATE_23_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	We weren’t up to the task!
1-KARATE_23_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Even though my team could break bricks and\nshatter boulders, they failed to dent your spirits!
1-KARATE_24_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Howdy! I’m crazy for karate! Hear the howl\nof my iron fists!
1-KARATE_24_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Losing made it clear to me—you’re crazy\nabout Pokémon!
1-KARATE_24_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I love seeing people who love Pokémon more\nthan anything!
1-VETERAN_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	What do you expect to achieve here? I’ll be the\none to make that call!
1-VETERAN_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’ve earned the right to be here—both you\nand your Pokémon.
1-VETERAN_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You may find it odd, but the stink of sulfur from\nthe volcanic gas is what draws me here.
1-GINGAM_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I just got worked over! And by a kid, no less...
1-GINGALEADER1_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Ugh! Again and again...
1-GINGAM_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	It is our mission to stall you. Sorry, but we gotta\ndo our job.
1-GINGAM_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Losing was a part of my job, too... I feel better\nby saying that.
1-GINGAM_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	We won’t allow anyone to stop us from gathering\nthe three Pokémon from the three lakes.
1-GINGAW_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	In order for us to bring peace to the world,\nwe must control it!
1-GINGAW_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re too young to understand.
1-GINGAW_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Our boss always had plans for the three lakes.\c\nWhile you were blissfully ignorant, our work\nwent ahead...
1-GINGAM_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ll knock your Pokémon into orbit!
1-GINGAM_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My mind is going orbital!
1-GINGAM_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The Pokémon here has already been taken to our\nHQ in Veilstone City.\c\nIt’s far too late for a child like you to make\nany difference.
1-GINGAW_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	If this mission is successful, we will get a\nnice bonus.
1-GINGAW_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m heartbroken...
1-GINGAW_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I want Team Galactic to become powerful.\nThat is all I want.
1-GINGALEADER3_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You, my friend, are tough! I can see why you\ndefy us so...
1-GINGAM_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We set off the Galactic Bomb! Its blast force\nwas phenomenal!
1-GINGAM_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your Pokémon attack with phenomenal power...
1-GINGAM_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	So, you’re tough. Big deal. What do you think\nyou can accomplish?\c\nThere’s one of you up against the entirety of\nTeam Galactic.\c\nBy now, another crew should be on their way to\nLake Verity near that puny little Twinleaf Town!
1-GINGAM_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	On behalf of our boss, I’ll punish you for defying\nTeam Galactic!
1-GINGAM_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Grr... I’m the one who got punished in the end...
1-GINGAM_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	We’re Team Galactic! The number one syndicate\nin the world!\c\nTo defy us is to defy the universe!
1-GINGAW_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	...Would you like to join the Magikarp and flop\naround in the mud?
1-GINGAW_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	...Overwhelming!
1-GINGAW_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I played you for a child, and paid a stiff price for\nmy arrogance...\c\nHowever, you’re much too late.\c\nTeam Galactic has already found the sunken\nisland under the lake—\c\nAnd the Pokémon that slumbers there?\nWell, where do you think it is now?
1-GINGALEADER3_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re tough, kid! But I still pity the likes of you.
1-GINGAM_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Well, what have we here? A Trainer who’s lost\ntheir way?
1-GINGAM_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re lost but you won! That burns me up\nto 11!
1-GINGAM_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You barged right into our HQ? You must not\nknow what fear is, kid!
1-GINGAM_17_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You’re the first intruder we’ve had in our HQ!
1-GINGAM_17_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, sure. Why don’t you just get all cocky\nabout it!
1-GINGAM_17_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Without our special card key, you’re not going\nto get very far.\c\nWell, non-Team Galactic member? What’s your\nnext move?
1-GINGAW_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Who do you think you are, desecrating the halls\nof our HQ?!
1-GINGAW_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	A tough little Trainer is what you are...
1-GINGAW_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	We get around in Galactic HQ by a system of\nround warp panels.\c\nDo you think you will ever learn the way they\nconnect? Good luck!
1-GINGAM_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	People like you just don’t understand why we do\nwhat we do.\c\nYou don’t understand Team Galactic, so why is it\nthat you defy us?!
1-GINGAM_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I couldn’t understand the battle or\nyour toughness...
1-GINGAM_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I went out of my way to deliver my cool lines\nbefore the battle!\c\nYou should’ve let me win! Get a grip on\nreality, already!
1-GINGAM_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’m, like, this close to getting my promotion\nto commander.\c\nI’ll impress our great boss by making you my\nnewest trophy!
1-GINGAM_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	...I wish this never happened.
1-GINGAM_19_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Losing sets me back to square one...\c\nI’ll probably get bumped down to the gruntiest\nof the grunts... Humph!
1-GINGAM_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I smell an intruder!
1-GINGAM_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh, it was just my Pokémon that stunk...
1-GINGAM_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	We don’t stink! We’re on the cutting edge\nof stuff!
1-GINGAM_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Having fun scampering around our HQ,\nyou sneaky intruder?\c\nYour trailblazing will go out in a blaze of glory\nright now!
1-GINGAM_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your trailblazing streak lives on!
1-GINGAM_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	So what, you have momentum... It’s too late.\nThe experiment’s done!
1-GINGAW_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You should be tired out by now. It’s Team\nGalactic’s turn to shine!
1-GINGAW_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What? I don’t get it. What’s your rush?
1-GINGAW_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Pokémon are that important to you? Is that what\nthis is all about?
1-GINGAM_23_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Are you enjoying your unescorted, unauthorized,\nand unsettling tour of Team Galactic HQ?
1-GINGAM_23_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Let me do what I want!
1-GINGAM_23_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It doesn’t matter what happens to the\nTeam Galactic HQ building.\c\nSoon, all will belong to Team Galactic!
1-GINGAW_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hey there, little Trainer! You’re famous among\nTeam Galactic.\c\nThe order has been issued—we get a promotion\nif we put you down!
1-GINGAW_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I just blew my promotion...
1-GINGAW_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	What’s so special about you anyway?\c\nYou’re just like any other little kid Trainer\nanywhere else!
1-GINGAM_24_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Our time has come! It’s Team Galactic’s\ntime now!
1-GINGAM_24_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	When’s it gonna be my turn...
1-GINGAM_24_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It’s too late!\c\nNo amount of desperation from a kid like you\nwill make a difference!
1-GINGAM_25_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Our time will come... A time for only us!\c\nI’m going to turn back your time to a time\nbefore Pokémon!
1-GINGAM_25_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Gyah!
1-GINGAM_25_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You can struggle all you want, but you can’t stop\nTeam Galactic alone!\c\nIt doesn’t matter how many Pokémon you try to\nuse as your tools!
1-GINGAM_26_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Team Galactic is all-powerful!\c\nOnly a fool would show defiance to the mighty\nmight of Team Galactic!
1-GINGAM_26_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Not standing up to the mighty is foolish,\nyou say...?
1-GINGAM_26_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	It doesn’t matter if you’re an adult or a kid if you\nhave Pokémon.\c\nPokémon are the equalizers. I should have\nrealized sooner...
1-GINGAM_27_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I can’t believe you chased me here...\nOK, let’s see how tough you are.
1-GINGAM_27_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Where do you get that power?!
1-GINGAM_27_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Mount Coronet...\c\nI might only be a grunt, but even I can tell it has\na weird energy!
1-GINGAM_28_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	This is our final operation. No one will interfere!
1-GINGAM_28_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You turned the tables on me! I call interference...
1-GINGAM_28_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The closer you are to the peak, the closer you\nare to space!\c\nSoon, Team Galactic will... Uh... Team Galactic\nwill achieve greatness!
1-GINGAM_29_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Team Galactic will take control of everything!\c\nYou can try all you want, but you can’t do\nanything alone!
1-GINGAM_29_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	All you gave me was the taste of defeat...
1-GINGAM_29_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	...Is our boss about to ditch us and claim\neverything for himself?
1-GINGAW_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We grunts have been assigned two noble jobs—\c\nOne, to ensure the success of our operation at\nthe summit!\c\nAnd two, to utterly destroy anyone who\ndares interfere!
1-GINGAW_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I don’t accept this! I will not accept this!
1-GINGAW_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Join Team Galactic and then abide by our rules.\c\nThat would solve all our problems!
1-GINGAW_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Say, listen, do you realize you’re breaking hearts\nby being successful?\c\nIt’s your fault that Team Galactic members are in\nso much pain...
1-GINGAW_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	See? You’ve left me brokenhearted, too...
1-GINGAW_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	One person’s joy is another person’s sorrow...\c\nEveryone should be happy and laughing?\nHow ridiculous!\c\nTeam Galactic should be doing all the laughing!
1-GINGAW_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Our boss is going to do something huge at\nthe summit.\c\nBut here I am dealing with some pesky\nintruder...\c\nYou’re spoiling the atmosphere. You can lose\nquickly, right?
1-GINGAW_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re not supposed to work me over like that.
1-GINGAW_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	All my excitement’s gone now...\c\nThis whole Mount Coronet trip is too rough,\nlong, and draining...
1-GINGAW_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	You’ve worked so hard to get here. You should\nbe proud of yourself!\c\nAnd now, I’ll send you packing with only that\nhappy thought!
1-GINGAW_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wha— How dare you! That’s how you respond to\nmy generosity?
1-GINGAW_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	We couldn’t stop you... We’ll be discarded\nas useless...\c\nOur boss is ruthless that way...
1-RIVAL_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_FIRST_DAMAGE	Oh yeah? I’ll show you something wicked, too!
1-RIVAL_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	What the—? We’re in trouble?! Well, I won’t give\nup so easily!
1-RIVAL_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What just happened?! You’re telling me I lost?!
1-RIVAL_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_FIRST_DAMAGE	Oh yeah? I’ll show you something wicked, too!
1-RIVAL_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	What the—? We’re in trouble?! Well, I won’t give\nup so easily!
1-RIVAL_05_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What just happened?! You’re telling me I lost?!
1-RIVAL_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_FIRST_DAMAGE	Oh yeah? I’ll show you something wicked, too!
1-RIVAL_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	What the—? We’re in trouble?! Well, I won’t give\nup so easily!
1-RIVAL_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What just happened?! You’re telling me I lost?!
1-RIVAL_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	Yeah, I can tell you raised your Pokémon to\nbe tough!
1-RIVAL_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What just happened?! You’re telling me I lost?!
1-RIVAL_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	Yeah, I can tell you raised your Pokémon to\nbe tough!
1-RIVAL_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What just happened?! You’re telling me I lost?!
1-RIVAL_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	Yeah, I can tell you raised your Pokémon to\nbe tough!
1-RIVAL_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What just happened?! You’re telling me I lost?!
1-RIVAL_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	We’ve gotten out of tighter spots than this plenty\nof times before!
1-RIVAL_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	We’re not done yet! Neither me nor my Pokémon\nhave given up!
1-RIVAL_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What just happened?! You’re telling me I lost?!
1-RIVAL_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	We’ve gotten out of tighter spots than this plenty\nof times before!
1-RIVAL_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	We’re not done yet! Neither me nor my Pokémon\nhave given up!
1-RIVAL_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What just happened?! You’re telling me I lost?!
1-RIVAL_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	We’ve gotten out of tighter spots than this plenty\nof times before!
1-RIVAL_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	We’re not done yet! Neither me nor my Pokémon\nhave given up!
1-RIVAL_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What just happened?! You’re telling me I lost?!
1-RIVAL_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	I fully believe in this last one. I have no reason\nto freak out.
1-RIVAL_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	We’re not finished yet! We’ll get out of this spot\nbecause we’re so tight!
1-RIVAL_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What just went down?! My team still\nneeds raising?!
1-RIVAL_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	I fully believe in this last one. I have no reason\nto freak out.
1-RIVAL_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	We’re not finished yet! We’ll get out of this spot\nbecause we’re so tight!
1-RIVAL_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What just went down?! My team still\nneeds raising?!
1-RIVAL_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	I fully believe in this last one. I have no reason\nto freak out.
1-RIVAL_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	We’re not finished yet! We’ll get out of this spot\nbecause we’re so tight!
1-RIVAL_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What just went down?! My team still\nneeds raising?!
1-BIGFOUR1_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	Not yet! Your first Pokémon League victory\ndoesn’t come easily, kid!
1-BIGFOUR1_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I will now concede defeat.\c\nBut I think you came to see how great Bug-type\nPokémon can be.\c\nI hope you also realized what you’re up against\nin the Pokémon League.\c\nBattling is a deep and complex affair...
1-BIGFOUR2_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	Dear child, don’t assume for an instant that\nyou’ve won.
1-BIGFOUR2_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Well! Dear child, I must say, that was\nmost impressive.\c\nYour Pokémon believed in you and did their best\nto earn you the win.\c\nEven though I’ve lost, I find myself with this\nsilly grin!
1-BIGFOUR3_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	I can feel your determination. Your will is\noverpowering me!
1-BIGFOUR3_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	This situation is heating up! I’m blazing now!
1-BIGFOUR3_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Whoa!\c\nI wasn’t expecting this!\c\nI wasn’t looking down on you, but I didn’t think\nfor a second that I’d lose!\c\nThis is fantastic! You and your Pokémon\nare inspiring!
1-BIGFOUR4_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	Hmm... Now what should I do...
1-BIGFOUR4_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I see...\c\nYou getting past the three before me was\nno fluke. Your power is real.
1-CHAMPION_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	I can’t remember the last time I was put in a\ncorner like this!

1-COLDELITEM_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	We’ll come at you with our hearts ablaze!
1-COLDELITEM_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your heart burns as hot as mine!
1-COLDELITEW_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	This isn’t like last time. See how much I’ve\ntrained since then!
1-COLDELITEW_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Whew... You’re overtrained for me.
1-SKIERM_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I knew you were headed back here. I felt it with\nthe soles of my feet!

1-SKIERW_09_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	You really must like snow. After all, if you didn’t,\nI doubt that you’d come here so often!

1-FISHING_22_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Gwaaah! This is hurting!
1-GUITARIST_14_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Rock ’n’ roll! We’ll beat it out again: our rhythm\nof battle!
1-GUITARIST_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Can you hear it? That’s my guitar, weeping...
1-ELITEM_25_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Last time, you beat me before I had a chance to\nshow you my skill.\c\nThis time, I’ll show you why they consider me\nan ace!
1-ELITEM_25_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m burning with jealousy over your raw talent!
1-ELITEW_26_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Ace Trainers always work to improve their\nnatural-born talents.
1-ELITEW_26_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I see... I have to concede defeat.
1-COLLECTOR_11_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Listen—did you go to Ramanas Park? What was it\nlike? What was it like?
1-COLLECTOR_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re one enthusiastic Trainer.

1-SAILOR_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your Pokémon... They’re looking good!
1-PRINCE_07_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Ah, it’s you. I’m bored yet again. Care to break\nthe monotony?
1-PRINCE_07_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The monotony was broken, but at what cost?
1-PRINCE_08_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Ah, it’s you. I’m bored yet again. Care to break\nthe monotony?
1-PRINCE_08_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The monotony was broken, but at what cost?
1-SAILOR_12_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’ve been training here in hopes of going to the\nPokémon League.
1-SAILOR_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m shocked... No, really, I am.
1-SWIMMERM_24_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’ve decided! If I finally beat you, I’m headed for\nthe Pokémon League!
1-SWIMMERM_24_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	*blblblblugh*
1-SWIMMERM_25_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	It’s me again! The harsh sea here should have\ntoughened me up more!
1-SWIMMERM_25_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The world remains as harsh as ever...
1-SWIMMERW_23_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	It doesn’t matter how long it takes—I’m going to\nthe Pokémon League!
1-SWIMMERW_23_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Th-this is so hard...
1-SWIMMERW_24_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	How much stronger have your Pokémon become?\nLet me check ’em out, OK?
1-SWIMMERW_24_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’ve had my fill...
1-DRAGON_15_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	My dragon Pokémon chose to remain here to\nbecome powerful.
1-DRAGON_15_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Your battle style...
1-ESPM_13_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Why have you come back to this spot? I want to\nknow what all this means!
1-ESPM_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I see... So that’s what it means...
1-ESPW_13_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	See? You’ve come back again.\c\nThere must be something that draws you here...
1-ESPW_13_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The power that slumbers within you... It is rather\nmarvelous indeed...
1-VETERAN_16_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I am indeed a Veteran, but I don’t use that as an\nexcuse to slack off.\c\nI take pride in challenging those who have\nbested me before!
1-VETERAN_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I see... Simply outstanding.
1-BIRD_12_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I let my bird Pokémon do as they wish. And so,\nwe train here daily!
1-BIRD_12_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Sheesh... I arrive in a new place and it turns out\nto be the Battle Zone...
1-DRAGON_16_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’ve cranked up my dragon Pokémon’s abilities!\c\nI’ve been looking forward to seeing you again!
1-DRAGON_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Raising abilities alone doesn’t mean I can\nwin either...
1-ELITEM_28_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	I’ve discovered what’s missing from my battles—\nHave you discovered what’s missing from yours?
1-ELITEM_28_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I see it now... I know what I lack.
1-ELITEM_29_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	The urge to battle you again has struck me.\nWant to humor me?
1-ELITEM_29_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I shouldn’t have paid attention to my urge...
1-ELITEW_29_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	We’ve faced many challengers since we met,\nbut they were all weak...\c\nI relish the tough resistance that only you\ncan provide!
1-ELITEW_29_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’ve certainly found a tough adversary in you...
1-ELITEW_30_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Hello again! Please don’t hold anything back—\njust like before.
1-ELITEW_30_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hmm...
1-ESPM_14_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	You’re going to win again! That’s the future I saw!
1-ESPM_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What I saw in the future turned out to be true...
1-ESPW_14_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Right after this, you will hurl a Poké Ball in an\nastonishingly cool way!
1-ESPW_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Right after this, I have to pay out your\nprize money...
1-KARATE_26_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	This time—this time I will win! My spirit is\nrenewed and strong!
1-KARATE_26_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My spirit is broken...
1-RANGERM_09_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Do you remember my slogan?\nPeople! Nature! Pokémon!\c\nThat’s right. Harmony is essential!
1-RANGERM_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re A-OK!
1-RANGERW_09_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	By battling tough opponents, both people and\nPokémon grow tough!
1-RANGERW_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	My, you are tough.
1-SWIMMERM_26_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	Yo, Pokémon-riding Trainer! How about\na rematch?
1-SWIMMERM_26_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Awesome! You’re a real wild child!
1-SWIMMERW_25_TRMSG_REVENGE_FIGHT_START	People still keep coming to us for battles! Why?!
1-SWIMMERW_25_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	OK, we lost.
1-GINGAM_35_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Yeah, like I’m really supposed to win with a\nPokémon like this...
1-COLDELITEM_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	We spend all our time battling in the blizzards of\nSnowpoint City.\c\nWe’ll show you how it’s toughened us up!
1-COLDELITEM_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	What’s with your toughness?!
1-COLDELITEM_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	You’ve battled all over, you say? That makes you\ntough, perhaps.
1-COLDELITEW_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I’ve only been involved with Pokémon for a\nshort time.\c\nI managed to get this far because skilled friends\ntoughened me up!
1-COLDELITEW_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I can’t believe how tough you are!
1-COLDELITEW_09_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	If you have wonderful friends, there is no limit to\nhow far you can go.

1-SCIENTIST_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Hey, now! Our HQ is a state-of-the-art facility!\c\nA snot-nosed kid like you ought to keep your\ndirty hands to yourself!
1-SCIENTIST_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You and your Pokémon weren’t part of\nmy calculations...
1-SCIENTIST_14_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Our boss is trying to create an entirely\nnew world.\c\nA world only for us! For Team Galactic!

1-POKEGIRL_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Pikachu...
1-POKEGIRL_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	Pika...\c\nI’ll need a lot more practice to become a\nreal Pikachu...
1-WORKER_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	I work at a red-hot foundry. Watch out,\nI’m on fire!
1-WORKER_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I burned out...
1-WORKER_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	I toughened up my muscles from honest work.\nPokémon have nothing on me!
1-WORKER_17_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Well! It’s not often we get a visitor like you to\nthe ironworks!\c\nLet’s mark the occasion with a battle!

1-WORKER_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_START	Are you maybe getting annoyed by where the\nfloor panels take you?
1-WORKER_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m going down in flames!
1-WORKER_18_TRMSG_FIGHT_AFTER	The sweat of a working man is beautiful\nto behold...\c\nThere is also beauty in the tears wept\nfrom defeat...
1-GINGAM_30_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	The toughest of all the grunts! That was me...
1-GINGAW_16_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Arrgh! I let some little kid beat me!
1-GINGALEADER1_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Sheesh... I should have done the fighting myself.
1-GINGALEADER2_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Humph! You’ve toughened up. But you’re no\nmatch for our boss.
1-GINGAM_37_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Done in by two kids?! This isn’t right!
1-GINGAM_38_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I should have kept my head down and just\nwatched our warehouse...
1-GINGAM_36_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Fweh... If I didn’t run...I could’ve...\nbattled harder...
1-GINGALBOSS_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	My last Pokémon.
1-GINGALBOSS_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	I see... I may lose if this pace continues...
1-GINGALBOSS_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Interesting. And quite curious.
1-GINGALBOSS_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	I admit that you have pushed me to this extreme.
1-GINGALBOSS_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	This... This cannot be! It’s not possible that I lose!
1-GINGALBOSS_02_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I won’t accept this! The power spoken of\nin mythology...\c\nI didn’t just make it obey me, I made it my own!

1-TOWERBOSS_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_WIN	That was a close one, and a fantastic\nPokémon battle!\c\nI know you’ll become even more skilled.\nPlease come and challenge me again!
1-RIVAL_26_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wha—? This is a joke, right? This can’t\nbe happening!
1-TOWERBOSS_04_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Spectacular! Truly spectacular!
1-LEADER1_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_WIN	Yup, that’s the power of Rock-type Pokémon!
1-LEADER1_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Wh-what? That can’t be! My buffed-up Pokémon!
1-LEADER2_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_WIN	Didja see that? Grass-type Pokémon really grow\nup strong and healthy!
1-LEADER2_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That’s it, then! I lost!
1-LEADER4_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_WIN	I guess strength can be rather short-lived!
1-LEADER4_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Um... It seems I’ve lost.
1-LEADER7_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_WIN	Gwahahaha! All my training on Iron Island has\npaid off!
1-LEADER7_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Hmm! My sturdy Pokémon, defeated!
1-LEADER6_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_WIN	Eheheh! Dignified enough for you?
1-LEADER6_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You really are mighty! Yup, Candice lost!
1-LEADER5_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_WIN	Ohohoho!\c\n<size=250%>Ohohoho!</size>
1-LEADER5_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Oh! I missed a step!
1-LEADER8_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_WIN	All right. That’s got my heart rate steady again.
1-LEADER8_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Outstanding! I acknowledge your electrifying win!
1-LEADER3_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_WIN	Yes! That’s a W-I-N...for Crasher Wake!
1-LEADER3_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	WHAAAT?! I think it’s fair to say that you\nabsolutely demolished me!
1-CHANPION_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_WIN	An admirable attempt! I could feel your passion\nfor battle. Let’s do this again sometime!
1-CHANPION_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That was excellent. You have a beautiful way\nof battling!
1-TOWERBOSS_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_WIN	A fierce bout that was!\c\nI can definitely tell that you’re serious about this.\nCome back and try again any time!
1-TOWERBOSS_03_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	A magnificent bout that was! You really are the\npinnacle of Trainers!
1-BIGFOUR1_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	Not yet! We’ll keep struggling till the very end!
1-BIGFOUR1_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	A bug Pokémon’s life force is nothing to sneer at!
1-BIGFOUR1_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Guess I was still one step behind... You’ve won.
1-BIGFOUR1_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I lost completely. But I think you’ve come to\nrealize how great bug Pokémon can be.
1-bigfour2_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	Ahahaha! Victory may be in sight, but take care\nnot to lose your footing!
1-bigfour2_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	No matter where you stand, you can always\ncount on the ground beneath your feet.
1-bigfour2_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That was quite something. Your youth gives you\na confidence in battle that can’t be shaken.
1-bigfour2_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I’m very impressed. Your strength shook me like\na tremor from the earth itself.
1-bigfour3_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	Hey! I’m about to go full throttle!
1-bigfour3_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	Things are getting so hot, I can see heat waves!
1-bigfour3_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Incredible! Your moves are so hot, they make\nmine look lukewarm!
1-bigfour3_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	Unbelievable! What burning passion!\c\nYou’re like the sun to your own solar system,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!
1-bigfour4_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	Hmm... How might I turn this situation to\nmy advantage?
1-bigfour4_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	Here comes my masterstroke! This is the moment\nthe tables turn!
1-bigfour4_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I see... It appears you’ve put me in checkmate.
1-bigfour4_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	So it goes. You held the whole course of the\nbattle in the palm of your hand.
1-champion_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST	Who knew getting backed into a corner could\nbe so much fun?
1-champion_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_POKE_LAST_HP_HALF	No, not yet! I won’t let you end things this easily!
1-champion_11_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That went well beyond my wildest expectations!\nWhat an exceptional battle!
1-champion_21_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	That went above and beyond my expectations.\nWhat a marvelous battle.
1-MORIMOTO_01_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	And so we prove that the strongest and most\namazing of all is...actually you!

35-msg_c01r0201_idol_01	More than singing! More than dancing!\nI love Pokémon! So, shall we battle?
35-msg_c01r0201_idol_02	I’ll let you join my fan club if you can beat me!
35-msg_c01r0201_idol_03	Aww, that’s heartbreaking... I’m an idol, too...
35-msg_c01r0201_idol_04	Well, that’s me and my Pokémon! Thank you for\nbeing such a fan!\c\nJust so you know, our latest single is called\n“Jigglin’ Pokémon Wub”!
35-msg_c01r0201_reporter_01	I’m working on a story. Can you battle me?
35-msg_c01r0201_reporter_02	Join me for a live report!
35-msg_c01r0201_reporter_03	Press coverage denied... But you’re so intriguing!
35-msg_c01r0201_reporter_04	Interviews are about taking the initiative.
35-msg_c01r0201_cameraman_01	I’ve spotted a charismatic Trainer! Is it OK to go\nfor the scoop?
35-msg_c01r0201_cameraman_02	As a professional cameraman, I always go for the\nbest shot!
35-msg_c01r0201_cameraman_03	That’s a downer... I thought I’d found a Trainer\nand Pokémon who’d shine on camera.
35-msg_c01r0201_cameraman_04	The lively expressions on you and your\nPokémon’s faces make for some great TV!
35-msg_c01r0201_pierrot_01	Are we all ready to have some fun? I sure am!\nAren’t you having fun? Let’s make it fun! OK?!
35-msg_c01r0201_pierrot_02	OK, how shall we do this? Shall we try\nsomething fantastical?
35-msg_c01r0201_pierrot_03	Oh, how shall I say this? It makes me all lonely,\nI say...
35-msg_c01r0201_pierrot_04	A clown’s makeup is a face that’s crying while\nlaughing. It defines what we do!
35-msg_c01r0201_interview1_01	Two Pokémon! If you had two Pokémon, we’d get\na great shot here.
35-msg_c01r0201_interview1_02	Oh! You’re ready for a battle with us?
35-msg_c01r0201_interview1_03	You’re live on camera, but try to act natural, OK?
35-msg_c01r0201_interview1_04	OK, that’s how it is, huh. Can’t do anything\nabout that.
35-msg_c01r0201_interview1_05	I’d like to take that footage and have it\nbroadcast worldwide.
35-msg_c01r0201_interview2_01	Oh, no. What we really want to see is you in\naction with two Pokémon!
35-msg_c01r0201_interview2_02	*giggle*\nWill you have a battle with us?
35-msg_c01r0201_interview2_03	We’ll thoroughly check you out as a Trainer!
35-msg_c01r0201_interview2_04	Oh, too bad! I wanted to check out\nyour Pokémon!
35-msg_c01r0201_interview2_05	I lost, but I’m totally thrilled! We made a\nwonderful spectacle!
35-msg_c01r0201_pokegirl_01	Po-Po-Pokémon!\c\nI want to become more like a Pikachu! Will you\nbattle me?
35-msg_c01r0201_pokegirl_02	Pi-Pikachu!
35-msg_c01r0201_pokegirl_03	Pikachu!
35-msg_c01r0201_pokegirl_04	I need to get more into the character of\na Pokémon...
35-msg_c01r0201_guitarist_01	Come on, time to show off our Pokémon!\nLet’s do battle, kiddo!
35-msg_c01r0201_guitarist_02	Your spirit’s giving off some seriously cool vibes...\nI can tell that you totally rock!
35-msg_c01r0201_guitarist_03	Now, that is seriously uncool. You have to let\nyour passion burn!
35-msg_c01r0201_guitarist_04	Rock is about your spirit! Battling is about spirit,\ntoo! That’s what makes a battle rock!
54-msg_c01r0701_trainer_boy_01	Battling is the best way to learn! Can we get a\nbattle with you?
54-msg_c01r0701_trainer_boy_02	Go, my Pokémon, go!
54-msg_c01r0701_trainer_boy_03	Aww! But battling is the best way to learn\nabout Pokémon!
54-msg_c01r0701_trainer_boy_04	It’s hard to win if you don’t have some Pokémon\nto choose from.
54-msg_c01r0701_trainer_boy_05	Whew! You’re really good. We’ve been studying\nevery day, but we were no match at all!\c\nYou’d be able to use these Technical Machines\nproperly. Here you go!
54-msg_c01r0701_trainer_boy_06	If you boot up TM10, you can use it to teach\nWork Up to a Pokémon.\c\nA Pokémon that uses Work Up in battle will raise\nits Attack and Sp. Atk at the same time.\c\nBut remember—a TM is good for one use only.\nDon’t waste it!
54-msg_c01r0701_trainer_girl3_01	I just became friends with my Pokémon.\c\nI’m not sure if we can do this properly, but may\nwe battle?
54-msg_c01r0701_trainer_girl3_02	I need to try the things I learned before I\nforget them!
54-msg_c01r0701_trainer_girl3_03	Boo! Where’s your sense of adventure?\c\nDon’t be shy about talking to people and getting\ninto battles!
54-msg_c01r0701_trainer_girl3_04	Do you think we would have done better if I\nused Potions?
54-msg_c01r0701_trainer_girl3_05	We were actually confident that we would do\npretty good. But I’m completely impressed by\r\nhow tough you are.\c\nIf you’d like, talk to my friend and get some\nTechnical Machines from him.
115-msg_l02r0101_0100a_01	Before we make our toast, I’d hoped for a battle.\c\nHowever, you seem to be short a Pokémon\nfor that.
115-msg_l02r0101_0100b_01	If you want to have a battle with us, you’ll need\nto bring more Pokémon.
115-msg_l02r0101_0101a_01	With someone as beautiful as you for my model,\nI am sure to paint a masterpiece!
115-msg_l02r0101_0101a_02	What is it? Do you wish for a battle?
115-msg_l02r0101_0101a_04	Though we lost our battle... A toast to your\nbeauty, which no painting could ever hope\r\nto capture!
115-msg_l02r0101_0101b_01	He said he’d treat me to a dinner here if I agreed\nto model for him. So, I came along, but I haven’t\r\nmade up my mind yet.
115-msg_l02r0101_0101b_02	When I can’t decide, I battle to help make the\ndecision! How about it?
115-msg_l02r0101_0101b_04	I’ve decided to model for him. That’s given me\nan appetite!
115-msg_l02r0101_0102a_01	There is no price too high for the sake of my art.\c\nThat said... My oh my, these meals look\nawfully pricey...
115-msg_l02r0101_0102a_02	What is it? Are you feeling hungry, too?\nOh, I see. That’s not it—you wanted a battle!
115-msg_l02r0101_0102a_04	My hors d’oeuvres have gone cold...
115-msg_l02r0101_0102b_01	I have to slow down on eating these delicious\nhors d’oeuvres. I don’t want to be all bloated\r\nby the time the main dish comes.
115-msg_l02r0101_0102b_02	I’d like a light battle to work up my appetite.\nWould you care to join us?
115-msg_l02r0101_0102b_04	The hors d’oeuvres haven’t grown cold...\nThese are supposed to be served chilled!
115-msg_l02r0101_0103a_01	The worth of a meal isn’t determined merely\nby its flavor.\c\nPresentation—that is, color and placement—\nis vital.\c\nIn other words, a fine meal can be likened to the\nfinest work of art...
115-msg_l02r0101_0103a_02	And in Pokémon battles, I also hope to see\nbeauty. You do agree with me, yes?
115-msg_l02r0101_0103a_04	The meals prepared here are not merely\nhealthy—they are also tasty. Diners need not\r\nworry about finding just what they want here.
115-msg_l02r0101_0103b_01	Today’s main dish is scrumptiously delicious!\nIf I can keep eating this food, I’ll model anytime!
115-msg_l02r0101_0103b_02	I feel guilty just eating all this delicious food\nlike this. I’ll join the battle, too!
115-msg_l02r0101_0103b_04	The models of great paintings all look very\ndifferent. That means I don’t need to worry\r\nabout fitting in!
115-msg_l02r0101_0200a_01	If you want to challenge us, bring some\nmore Pokémon.
115-msg_l02r0101_0200b_01	If you want to battle us, you have to have at\nleast two Pokémon!
115-msg_l02r0101_0201a_01	Actually, my father happens to be the chef here.
115-msg_l02r0101_0201a_02	What is it you want, a battle? Bahaha...\nYou think you can beat us?
115-msg_l02r0101_0201a_04	We’ve lost, but let’s make a toast to our future\ntogether anyway!
115-msg_l02r0101_0201b_01	Oh, my! Your father is the chef here?\nHow wonderful!
115-msg_l02r0101_0201b_02	I haven’t told him, but my father owns the hotel\nand restaurant...\c\nOh, but that’s beside the point. Would you care\nfor a battle?
115-msg_l02r0101_0201b_04	Let’s toast to the prosperity of the restaurant!
115-msg_l02r0101_0202a_01	I have to hand it to my father—these hors\nd’oeuvres are delicious!
115-msg_l02r0101_0202a_02	Are you asking me for a battle? Well, certainly!\nI never back down from a challenge!
115-msg_l02r0101_0202a_04	Finally. Now we can go about enjoying our meal\nwithout disruption.
115-msg_l02r0101_0202b_01	Yes! This meal is good enough to serve at\nthe hotel.
115-msg_l02r0101_0202b_02	My papa owns this restaurant, but please don’t\ntell my date—his father works here as a chef.\c\nI’ll have a battle with you if you keep your\nmouth shut.
115-msg_l02r0101_0202b_04	My date did his best, but you were better than\nthe both of us.
115-msg_l02r0101_0203a_01	Heh! My date’s really enjoying Father’s cooking.\nShe has a dreamy expression after every bite!
115-msg_l02r0101_0203a_02	I’m feeling great! Sure, I’ll have a battle with you.\nThat’s why you approached us, right?
115-msg_l02r0101_0203a_04	My prowess as a Trainer isn’t up to snuff...\nIt’s not like my father’s scrumptious cooking.
115-msg_l02r0101_0203b_01	This succulent flavor! It reminds me of a world\ntrip I took. My papa and I traveled everywhere,\r\ndining at only the best restaurants.
115-msg_l02r0101_0203b_02	Eating this fabulous meal has really lifted my\nspirits. Join us for a battle?
115-msg_l02r0101_0203b_04	Your father’s cooking has a very magical quality\nto it. It seems to perk people up with energy.
115-msg_l02r0101_0300a_01	If your intention is to test your skill on us,\nI daresay you ought to bring at least one\r\nother Pokémon.
115-msg_l02r0101_0300b_01	Oh, you’re offering to do battle with us?\nHow nice of you.\c\nUnfortunately, you simply cannot battle us both\nwith just one Pokémon.
115-msg_l02r0101_0301a_01	Let me propose a toast to many more happy\nyears together.
115-msg_l02r0101_0301a_02	Since I took my retirement, I’ve been traveling\nwith my wife. We both enjoy searching for\r\ndelicious dining experiences.\c\nYou seem to enjoy battling with Pokémon.\nAm I right?
115-msg_l02r0101_0301a_04	Well, so much for that. Let’s try to enjoy the rest\nof our meal.
115-msg_l02r0101_0301b_01	To our health, our welfare, and fine\ndining! Cheers!
115-msg_l02r0101_0301b_02	A toast before a meal helps stimulate the\nappetite, I find.\c\nBut that’s neither here nor there. You wanted a\nbattle, surely?
115-msg_l02r0101_0301b_04	Gourmet dining in restaurants and exhilarating\nPokémon battles...\c\nThere is so much contentment in my life!
115-msg_l02r0101_0302a_01	Hmm! Now, this is special! It looks like it was just\nquickly warmed through, but in reality, much care\r\nhas gone into its preparation!
115-msg_l02r0101_0302a_02	When one gets to be an accomplished gourmet\nlike myself, one can tell at a glance if a dish is\r\ndelicious or not.\c\nYou would battle against such discerning taste?
115-msg_l02r0101_0302a_04	Well, so much for that. We’ll keep a stiff upper\nlip and look forward to enjoying the main course.
115-msg_l02r0101_0302b_01	These hors d’oeuvres are simply divine!\nThey tell me that I can expect the main\r\ncourse to be fantastic!
115-msg_l02r0101_0302b_02	I thought the main course arrived already...\nYou’re a Trainer seeking battle?
115-msg_l02r0101_0302b_04	The hors d’oeuvres were most excellent!
115-msg_l02r0101_0303a_01	Mmm! The chef flambéed this to perfection!\nThe rich aromas and flavors fill my mouth\r\nwith joy!
115-msg_l02r0101_0303a_02	You’re throwing down a challenge in the middle\nof our meal? I would say you’re a very dedicated\r\nTrainer, especially for one so young!
115-msg_l02r0101_0303a_04	Ah... I’m very satisfied with our meal and\nour battle.
115-msg_l02r0101_0303b_01	Mmm, this sauce!\c\nIt’s a spicy sauce made Hoenn-style from grated\nCheri Berries!
115-msg_l02r0101_0303b_02	Would you like to sample a bite...? Oh, right.\nPokémon battle?
115-msg_l02r0101_0303b_04	Battling is fine, of course. But personally, I would\nrather be out enjoying good meals.
115-msg_l02r0101_0400a_01	If you want to battle us, you’ll have to bring at\nleast two Pokémon.
115-msg_l02r0101_0400b_01	Don’t you have more than one Pokémon?\nWe’ll have to battle another time!
115-msg_l02r0101_0401a_01	Alison, um, I, er... Thank you for coming today.\nShould we make a toast?
115-msg_l02r0101_0401a_02	She’s the girl from the Pokémon supply store I go\nto all the time. We’re incredibly happy together.\r\nWould you like to battle us?
115-msg_l02r0101_0401a_04	Oh, gosh. I’m sorry we lost, Alison. You’re not\nupset, are you?
115-msg_l02r0101_0401b_01	Hee hee... Eugene, you act so different from the\nway you do at the store. You’re surprisingly shy.
115-msg_l02r0101_0401b_02	I work at a Pokémon supply store because I\nlove Pokémon.\c\nMy job lets me be with Pokémon all day long,\nso it naturally made me pretty decent at battling.\r\nWant to try us?
115-msg_l02r0101_0401b_04	I don’t worry much about winning or losing.\nI keep my Pokémon with me because I love it!
115-msg_l02r0101_0402a_01	If my Pokémon buddies heard I went on a date\nwith you, Alison...they’d probably hate me for it.
115-msg_l02r0101_0402a_02	Are you Alison’s fan, too?
115-msg_l02r0101_0402a_04	Alison, seeing your smiling face... I can’t tell if\nthese appetizers are delicious or not!
115-msg_l02r0101_0402b_01	Sorry, what? A date? Um, Eugene... You are a\nvalued customer and all, but I just don’t know...
115-msg_l02r0101_0402b_02	I know I’m being indecisive, but I have to admit—\nhis invitation was just too flattering to refuse.\c\nI’ll let my Pokémon decide for my fickle heart.\nLet’s battle?
115-msg_l02r0101_0402b_04	You know, it’s true what they say—there is no\nevil among Pokémon fans! That goes for you\r\nand Eugene!
115-msg_l02r0101_0403a_01	Looks like our main course is here. Please enjoy\nyourself—I’ve got the bill covered today!
115-msg_l02r0101_0403a_02	I’ll defeat you and collect the prize money!
115-msg_l02r0101_0403a_04	My wallet’s empty after paying the prize money...\c\nOh, no, it’s OK! No need to worry! I still have my\nsecret stash of cash!
115-msg_l02r0101_0403b_01	Eugene, I think you’re a little awkward,\nbut you’re very earnest.
115-msg_l02r0101_0403b_02	If I team up with my date, it might make for an\ninteresting combination.\c\nI think we could battle in an intriguing manner.\nDo you?
115-msg_l02r0101_0403b_04	The meal was delicious, and our battle was so\nmuch fun. I really insist that we split the bill.
115-msg_l02r0101_0500a_01	If you had two Pokémon, I’d take you on with\nmy mom.
115-msg_l02r0101_0500b_01	I’m willing to have a battle with my son,\nmy pride and joy.\c\nBut you must bring more Pokémon than that.
115-msg_l02r0101_0501a_01	What should I have today? Juice, ice cream,\ncake, and, and...
115-msg_l02r0101_0501a_02	Oh, hi, Trainer! Want to battle Pokémon with us\nbefore we have a yummy dinner?
115-msg_l02r0101_0501a_04	I don’t get it. Grown-ups always have a toast\nbefore eating. But why don’t I see any bread?
115-msg_l02r0101_0501b_01	My dear, Mommy is so proud of you for doing\nwell on your test.\c\nYou may order anything you like. It’s your\nreward, dearest!
115-msg_l02r0101_0501b_02	Did you know? My boy is not only a genius\nat school, but he’s also a Pokémon prodigy!\r\nWould you like to challenge us and see?
115-msg_l02r0101_0501b_04	I wish to propose a toast. May my darling\nEsteban get another 100% on a test!
115-msg_l02r0101_0502a_01	Wow, they bring out things one dish at a time!\nIt’s not like how it is at home!
115-msg_l02r0101_0502a_02	I do my homework while eating, so I can\nbattle anytime!
115-msg_l02r0101_0502a_04	We’re going to eat this delicious stuff now.\nBye-bye!
115-msg_l02r0101_0502b_01	This restaurant is the talk of the town for its\ndelicious food.
115-msg_l02r0101_0502b_02	I beg your pardon? You want to battle now?\nWell, all right. It’s not as if I dislike battling.
115-msg_l02r0101_0502b_04	Thank you for letting my dear son experience an\ninvaluable lesson.
115-msg_l02r0101_0503a_01	Do mothers and fathers go out to eat like this?\nI mean, without taking their kids along.
115-msg_l02r0101_0503a_02	Well, that’s OK. It’s way more fun for me to\nbattle than go eat fancy dinners!
115-msg_l02r0101_0503a_04	Mom, you gotta make me this at home!
115-msg_l02r0101_0503b_01	This is a special occasion, Esteban. We’re here\nto celebrate your great grades!
115-msg_l02r0101_0503b_02	Oh? A battle, you say? Well, certainly. Why not?
115-msg_l02r0101_0503b_04	Is the dessert coming soon?
115-msg_l02r0101_0600a_01	My daughter and I always battle together.\nNone of that one-on-one nonsense.
115-msg_l02r0101_0600b_01	I can battle against you with my dad. But first,\nplease bring more Pokémon.
115-msg_l02r0101_0601a_01	Here’s a toast for your mother. May she always\nbe healthy!
115-msg_l02r0101_0601a_02	My wife’s in the hospital waiting for the baby\nto arrive. Since I can’t cook, I came here with\r\nmy daughter.\c\nHow would you like a battle with us before\nwe eat?
115-msg_l02r0101_0601a_04	The house will be a lot noisier when your mother\ncomes home with the new baby.
115-msg_l02r0101_0601b_01	I wonder what Mom will bring home—a baby\nbrother, or a baby sister?
115-msg_l02r0101_0601b_02	Whether it’s a boy or a girl, I’m going to be their\nbig sister—so I should get better at Pokémon!
115-msg_l02r0101_0601b_04	Little babies cry like Pokémon! Piyaaaah!
115-msg_l02r0101_0602a_01	Wow... Look at these appetizers. This is just\nso extravagant.
115-msg_l02r0101_0602a_02	I’m no cook. I’ll admit that freely.\c\nBut battling Pokémon... There’s something I’m\ncomfortable with.
115-msg_l02r0101_0602a_04	Let’s get over the sting of that loss by enjoying\nthis delicious meal!
115-msg_l02r0101_0602b_01	Wow! This food looks really fancy!
115-msg_l02r0101_0602b_02	Papa is a rotten cook, so we get to go out and\neat good food like this! Did you come to this\r\nrestaurant to battle Pokémon?
115-msg_l02r0101_0602b_04	I’ve never eaten anything like this before.
115-msg_l02r0101_0603a_01	Here’s the main dish!
115-msg_l02r0101_0603a_02	What is it? Did you want to battle with us?
115-msg_l02r0101_0603a_04	Blythe, I hope the new baby will grow up to be\nas kindhearted as you.
115-msg_l02r0101_0603b_01	I wish Mom were here to eat with us...
115-msg_l02r0101_0603b_02	My mom gave me my Pokémon. Want to see how\ntough they are?
115-msg_l02r0101_0603b_04	Next time, let’s all come here together—\neven the baby!
115-msg_l02r0101_0700a_01	What’s up? Did you want to be on TV, too?\nOh, right, sorry! You wanted to battle!\c\nYou’d be battling the two of us. You need at\nleast two Pokémon for that.
115-msg_l02r0101_0700b_01	If you want an autograph, you’ll have to wait till\nwe finish filming.\c\nOh, and if you want to battle, bring two\nPokémon, OK?
115-msg_l02r0101_0701a_01	Let’s start with a shot of the drinks as a\ncamera test.
115-msg_l02r0101_0701a_02	Huh? You’re inviting us to battle at a time\nlike this?
115-msg_l02r0101_0701a_04	Oh, man... Our drinks are lukewarm now.
115-msg_l02r0101_0701b_01	Today’s featured drink is freshly squeezed juice\nmade from ripened Pecha Berries picked\r\nthis morning!
115-msg_l02r0101_0701b_02	Pardon? A Pokémon battle? OK, a quick one\nbefore we do any filming for the show.
115-msg_l02r0101_0701b_04	Do you think we should rehearse this one\nmore time?\c\nToday’s featured drink is freshly squeezed...
115-msg_l02r0101_0702a_01	Hey, these appetizers sure do look delicious.\nWill someone bring me a mist spray so they look\r\neven fresher?
115-msg_l02r0101_0702a_02	Thanks, that was quick! Wait... Where’s the\nmist spray?\c\nOh, you want a battle? Whatever, then. I’m up\nfor your challenge!
115-msg_l02r0101_0702a_04	Photographing food isn’t easy. It’s actually\nvery technical.
115-msg_l02r0101_0702b_01	These look fabulous, too. We need the camera\nto zoom in more!
115-msg_l02r0101_0702b_02	Please don’t talk to me while we’re filming!\c\nOh, actually, hold on. A Trainer barges in on our\nfine dining experience...\c\nI like that! It adds drama to our story!
115-msg_l02r0101_0702b_04	Darling Darryl, are you ready? When I take a\nbite, I want a close-up of my lips. All right?
115-msg_l02r0101_0703a_01	Whoa... So this is the main dish? Yowza! Let’s get\nthis filming done quick so I can chow down, too!
115-msg_l02r0101_0703a_02	You’ve been sniffing around a lot... Are you\nmessing with our filming?
115-msg_l02r0101_0703a_04	Oh, no... Everything’s gone cold while we\nwere battling.
115-msg_l02r0101_0703b_01	*chomp*\c\nMmm... This is...light, and yet rich-flavored...\nIt delectably melts away... A hint of an aftertaste,\r\nyet crisp... Neither too sweet nor too bitter...\r\nMy words can’t do this justice!
115-msg_l02r0101_0703b_02	It’s not easy trying to describe food while you’re\neating. But I can battle anytime during filming!
115-msg_l02r0101_0703b_04	Do you know what the most important thing is\nfor gourmet reporting?\c\nIt’s a...thesaurus-like vocabulary!
115-msg_l02r0101_0800a_01	I’ll only say this once, so listen closely. I’ll even\nsay it slowly—to battle against two Trainers,\r\nyou need two or more Pokémon.\c\nNow if you were to bring more Pokémon, I could\nconsider a battle...
115-msg_l02r0101_0800b_01	Oh, you’ll have to bring more Pokémon than that\nto battle us!
115-msg_l02r0101_0801a_01	And that’s another brilliant day on the markets!\nA toast to my Lady Luck!
115-msg_l02r0101_0801a_02	Since I’ve been with her, I’ve been riding a hot\nstreak on the markets.\c\nI’m surfing on a wave of good luck! You’re sure\nyou want to battle us?
115-msg_l02r0101_0801a_04	This is just a minor setback. I can easily make up\nfor this!
115-msg_l02r0101_0801b_01	Ooh! All your stocks went up again? You haven’t\nguessed wrong yet!
115-msg_l02r0101_0801b_02	My boyfriend’s a stock market wizard!\c\nDid you know? Someone who’s that lucky also\nhappens to make for a tough Trainer.\c\nAre you willing to try your luck against that?
115-msg_l02r0101_0801b_04	It’s just one loss. We can make that back with a\nbig win next time!
115-msg_l02r0101_0802a_01	There’s no need for technique. You just have to\nread what’s in your opponent’s heart.
115-msg_l02r0101_0802a_02	Now, when I say “heart,” I don’t mean what a\nperson is thinking. It’s about how they want to\r\nbe perceived.\c\nDo you... Would you like me to think of you as a\ntough Trainer?
115-msg_l02r0101_0802a_04	I had a bad feeling about this Trainer...
115-msg_l02r0101_0802b_01	No, really? Wooow, that is so neat! How can you\ntell these things?
115-msg_l02r0101_0802b_02	My boyfriend could tell that deep down,\nI’m actually a frightened and lonely child!\c\nI don’t think I could ever lose with him.\nWant to test that theory?
115-msg_l02r0101_0802b_04	It’s amazing that you predicted you would lose!
115-msg_l02r0101_0803a_01	Let’s savor this extravagant meal and think of\nwhat it represents. We can use that as motivation\r\nto keep winning at life!
115-msg_l02r0101_0803a_02	Personally, I think there are two kinds of people:\nthose who face up to any challenge, and those\r\nwho duck and cover.\c\nYou’re the type who faces up to any challenge,\nam I right?
115-msg_l02r0101_0803a_04	If I had the power of premonition, I’d be a terror\non the markets.\c\nBut you know that’s not really possible.
115-msg_l02r0101_0803b_01	How can you guess right about everything all\nthe time?\c\nDo you really have the power of premonition?
115-msg_l02r0101_0803b_02	I’m convinced that he has some extrasensory\npower or something.\c\nIf I’m teaming up with a guy like that, are you\nsure you want to do this?
115-msg_l02r0101_0803b_04	If it’s not premonition, did you...maybe come\nfrom the future?
115-msg_l02r0101_0900a_01	One Pokémon is insufficient if you want to battle\nagainst us.
115-msg_l02r0101_0900b_01	If you’d bring two or more Pokémon, we could\nhave a battle with you.
115-msg_l02r0101_0901a_01	Hmm. This beverage’s coloration borders on the\npositively toxic... However, my analysis indicates\r\nthat it is composed of natural ingredients.
115-msg_l02r0101_0901a_02	What is it? You are...? Oh, yes, a Trainer.
115-msg_l02r0101_0901a_04	The results of that battle are insignificant.\nLet’s celebrate.
115-msg_l02r0101_0901b_01	Oh, dear! I wish you wouldn’t!\c\nWe’re at a fancy restaurant, and you want to\nanalyze what’s served?
115-msg_l02r0101_0901b_02	Oh, you’re a Trainer?
115-msg_l02r0101_0901b_04	Cheers, dear! Please don’t start analyzing what\nwe just drank!
115-msg_l02r0101_0902a_01	Interesting. These hors d’oeuvres are fascinating.\nPlant fiber 20%, iron 5%, protein 35%.\r\nCuriouser and curiouser...
115-msg_l02r0101_0902a_02	What is it now? Do you want me to analyze your\nskill level?
115-msg_l02r0101_0902a_04	I feel compelled to analyze that which is\nunknown to me. By defining its composition,\r\nI feel reassured in my knowledge.
115-msg_l02r0101_0902b_01	Oh, dear, must you go on that way? It takes the\nmagic out of a meal. I wish you wouldn’t think\r\nabout your research while we’re out eating!
115-msg_l02r0101_0902b_02	My husband never ceases to amaze me with his\ndedication to research.\c\nWould you care to have a battle with us?
115-msg_l02r0101_0902b_04	If you were to ask me, I’d rather not know about\nwhat I don’t understand. It’s simpler that way.
115-msg_l02r0101_0903a_01	By my calculations, the main dish should have\narrived by now. Perhaps the thermal setting is\r\ntoo low to prepare the food efficiently?
115-msg_l02r0101_0903a_02	You there! Let’s battle to consume time!
115-msg_l02r0101_0903a_04	They brought the main course while we were\nbattling... The calorie content appears to be\r\nalarmingly high.
115-msg_l02r0101_0903b_01	There isn’t any point getting impatient over the\nfood, dear. Isn’t this the sort of situation that you\r\nbrought your Pokémon for?
115-msg_l02r0101_0903b_02	Oh, what good timing! Would you join us for a\nquick battle?
115-msg_l02r0101_0903b_04	Don’t fret, dear. If we take in too many calories,\nwe can always work them off by battling!

1-SISTER_10_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	You’re a lucky one...
1-PRINCE_06_TRMSG_FIGHT_LOSE	I never thought I’d lose at Father’s restaurant...

106-msg_tv_02_03_01_1	Welcome to another episode of What’s\nFishing? Trainers with Rods.\c\nAs always, we have the Fishing Master as our\nguest speaker.
106-msg_tv_02_03_01_2	Hm!
